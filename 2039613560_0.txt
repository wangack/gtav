[2:00:01] najtrows: @Zombiesweat I love it in the old VODs atm. She just got keys to their house

[2:00:23] Zombiesweat: I think Rule of 6 is a good guideline for family rp actually

[2:20:02] frozonhawk: if shes working i can see her owning it as it could cause problems but otherwise she could pass it off
[2:20:11] najtrows: Crystal would admit mistakes and give herself a hard time, so it seems fun if Swan doesnt
[2:20:18] KevinRamm: Owning mistakes in work is a power move.  ignoring them in social/personal stuff can be funny

[16:05:09] sorasurfer808: Does Swan dress in all black to resemble a black swan? Which has cool meaning.
[16:05:11] Jatnutt: yes so he can get robbed back ofcourse
[16:05:33] elninost0rm: Incredible film
[16:05:37] sorasurfer808: The black swan theory
[16:05:54] Jatnutt: The black swan theory or theory of black swan events is a metaphor that describes an event that comes as a surprise, has a major effect, and is often inappropriately rationalized after the fact with the benefit of hindsight. The term is based on an ancient saying that presumed black swans did not exist, until they were discovered in Australia in 1697, and it then became reinterpreted to mean an unforeseen and consequential event.[1]
[16:05:59] sorasurfer808: Nah, it's an actual theory
[16:06:09] forever_eber: uhhhhh: it’s a bit dirty
[16:06:54] Jatnutt: It might relate later on ;)
[16:06:59] forever_eber: the film is
[16:07:28] sorasurfer808: A black swan event, a phrase commonly used in the world of finance, is an extremely negative event or occurrence that is impossibly difficult to predict. In other words, black swan events are events that are unexpected and unknowable.
[16:08:35] Jatnutt: Does Swans last name have a meaning behind it?

[16:11:43] Chotto_Matte285: in flemish 'to leur' it means to go door to door selling stuff
[16:12:36] Jatnutt: I thought at first it had something to do with luring
