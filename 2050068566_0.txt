[2:48:53] TheHangmansJoke: that man needs prio
[2:48:56] 2wicked001: your supplies still in clays truck
[2:48:58] midzito: thats exactly what they want
[2:48:59] m331o: yes thats good
[2:49:00] PrettyKrazy: the one job being g6 ? om
[2:49:00] kopcat7: Kitty cat
[2:49:02] xNeixen: i mean isnt that good?
[2:49:02] N0Ne123: Clay about to start up the stream OMEGALUL
[2:49:05] TangiblePear: People going to burn out so m uch faster if they can only do one job though
[2:49:08] axmxixrx: its so sad they killed all the city and focused them on g6
[2:49:09] Acheron13: Patar says hi/bye to Jason instead of his own daughter
[2:49:09] MaxaMinor: the problem is G6 is too good everyone is gonna pick that
[2:49:10] 1iwill: sounds insanely boring just doing 1 job all the time
[2:49:13] Mr_Tvi: You know this is gonna make material prices skyrocket, if they actually release something worth crafting
[2:49:17] axmxixrx: will be so boring
[2:49:18] moistf1ngers: did jayzAN buy t3 truck?
[2:49:19] M0hkofantti: Better start /award (state id) (reason) to Clay so he will get prio someday
[2:49:20] donbar0n: power rangers unite
[2:49:23] midzito: but like the whole econ is fucked because nick complained to buff g6, they did, and now everything else is not worth
[2:49:25] schibbitywah: /award 'state id' 'reason'
[2:49:28] khanoute: Exactly that, they want people to form crews with specialists
[2:49:29] BrandonBTB: yeh they dont want a jack of all trades type person so they're punishing doing multi job
[2:49:30] seix123: if you can do all the jobs there would not be any RP
[2:49:38] Phasehero: Didn't you lose 4 stars?
[2:49:45] khanoute: Instead of just one person maxing out everything
[2:49:46] of_the_Wolf: lets all just work G6 and buy whatever we need
[2:49:47] isp1337: i believe you need sani
[2:49:51] Flip25k: its not 1 job not all jobs go against each other. just have to pick which high rank job perk you want
[2:49:54] wolfgang_86: Gonna need sanni in the future btw 100% so dont switch unless you want to
[2:49:57] Levitax: u gonna need sani in the future for weapons crafting and stuff like that. i am pretty sure
[2:50:00] vazeline__: @midzito Not his problem, devs gotta know how to balance.
[2:50:00] Nahsta: You guys are giving nick way too much credit for how the server is
[2:50:00] almightydolla: It feels like they want people maxed out in all the different jobs and then the city will open up...like for crime, etc.
[2:50:03] ironbullman: its always been like that with g6
[2:50:03] Acheron13: Didn't Grime get buffed to as much as G6?
[2:50:08] Slaydess7: of_the_Wolf Talon Black Pog
[2:50:10] Alaineman: It's definitely worth it to have good rep in something, seeing how g6 300 rep was ass before this change. Sure it's for every job at some point
[2:50:12] Cenar96: I think it’s based on how much rep you have maybe if you have 300 rep you lose more when doing other things
[2:50:14] Capt4inJuli: 2.4 per run
[2:50:18] midzito: @vazeline__ it was balanced, he made it unbalanced LUL
[2:50:18] hafcabbage: mats/lumber prices must be skyrocketed now
[2:50:19] xLOWxKEYx: yea, I feel like they want all the jobs to have balanced employees instead of having this situation where the population flocks to one specific job
[2:50:30] retarcl: of_the_Wolf hi
