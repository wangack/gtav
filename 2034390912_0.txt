[3:40:11] adzse: Aaron W. Prince is a persistent man, and persistence is needed to play one of the most iconic smartphone games ever released ‚Äì Doodle Jump. He started playing Doodle Jump when the world record was already in the millions, but that didn‚Äôt stop him. After more than a year of playing, he defeated the world record with a score of 11.3 million ‚Äì and then went on to best his score again and reach a mind-blowing score of 24.2 million, which is estimated to take 40 hours to reach that score! dizzTHINK
