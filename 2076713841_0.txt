[5:58:47] xxjustmarkxx: Ziggys my favorite
[5:58:50] LeftCross: I just loved peoples reaction to snake
[5:58:53] automata93: Curtis just got so much hate a lot of which was unfair
[5:58:56] AndyAndyXD: Was the Snake mission on 3.0 was collab with Wiseguy??
[5:58:56] 5tolen: except the last mission with Pepega rangers FeelsStrongMan
[5:58:58] Samoas: i remember snake robbing houses for RP money haha
[5:59:02] Funsized: I feel so weird about voice changers for the same exact reason you mentioned. Like when I was first introduced to RP in NP 3.0 it was like "funny voices, funny people" things
[5:59:12] Kiddersteve: Poet is doing missions on ONX right now with admin help
[5:59:33] Funsized: SODA WAS THERE
[5:59:33] 5tolen: @AndyAndyXD he hops in and helps in the background himself

[6:00:18] cambion_tenebris: It was freakin classic
[6:00:38] RoLoSC: ron and bogg FeelsStrongMan
[6:00:42] Kiddersteve: @SilentSentry JoeFudge (Poet) on ONX submitted a mission list where he needs admin help and the admins agreed to it. So they are pretty open to it.
[6:00:44] EchosAxe: i liked john in general but i understand where you're coming from you wanted to do more
[6:00:51] MalletMark: that shit was sooo good
[6:00:53] TheWooD115: Have you seen one Nopixel how tuff it is to make money on there , they slowed the pause of money making its great for it I feel jail time is longEr to ?
[6:00:56] theglizzykisser: Ron and Bogg was the best duo man
[6:01:05] KnightOfModernTimes: The interaction from snake with jaboody was amaizing too
[6:01:10] Funsized: bogg the camera man had the best shots lmfao
[6:01:22] Fadedcjdaboss: bogg always rolling around on the bmx… man when rp was so fun to watch
[6:01:22] MalletMark: wiseguy was doing all the michael bay explosions for fun during ur RP :D

[6:02:08] truheel23: bovice
[6:02:14] automata93: ahh I forgot about the Bovice break
[6:02:15] AtlasSubstitute: everybody loves uchiha
[6:02:17] AtlasSubstitute: and cyr
[6:02:18] truheel23: good times
[6:02:20] AtlasSubstitute: one of the best
[6:02:24] Funsized: FeelsStrongMan
[6:02:30] MalletMark: bovice world was a crazy story line forsure
[6:02:32] Napalm789: Who are the owners (admins) of this server?

[6:03:24] 5tolen: https://clips.twitch.tv/CutePolishedAlbatrossVoHiYo-W349ikXrq4a000VJ
[6:03:35] theglizzykisser: jaboody has the snake mission on their YT channel. worth every second
[6:03:40] Kiddersteve: @KidsSeeeGhosts Yeah its really cool and the people completing will get unique weapons and stuff
[6:03:41] MalletMark: nopixel when there was only 30something slots was pretty great
[6:03:43] Samoas: is there any way to watch the Ron undercover racer VOD?
[6:03:44] Yars_Revenge: Your ad still up? no calls.
[6:03:49] AtlasSubstitute: will u be bringing Ron in Miami when that time arrives? @SilentSentry
[6:03:55] hippapossumous: ya is your ad up?

[6:05:06] honorablepunk: pole fails, all kind of shit LUL
[6:05:06] KidsSeeeGhosts: Kiddersteve Have any of them happened already?
[6:05:12] cambion_tenebris: Ron down there in Miami longing for the old cocaine days
[6:05:12] AzureMarquis: Great Rp always goes un noticed because it's so natural being just an immersive character.
[6:05:14] MalletMark: im so sad your dayZ mmjr w. felix isn't recorded anywhere
[6:05:20] LeftCross: The bovice escape is on youtube as well
[6:05:22] MalletMark: that was top tier
[6:05:24] DurinnTheDwarf: finkone is enjoying that retired life
[6:05:27] 5tolen: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEo9AFHJfOI best roleplay clip by sentry YEP
[6:05:42] 5tolen: @KidsSeeeGhosts wiseguy was the admin playing as that npc
[6:05:50] AtlasSubstitute: the person i miss a lot from roleplay is ThaCoop who played matthew payne
[6:05:56] AtlasSubstitute: that guy was funny as fuck
[6:05:56] Ramtho: Doyle and Eli was something else for a trooper duo
[6:05:58] AntleredCormorant: being mistaken for a "local" is great
[6:06:02] AzureMarquis: It's why Jordan is one of my favorite characters, he is just a character you would see in GTA naturally.
[6:06:07] AtlasSubstitute: and akamonkey who played arture
[6:06:12] AtlasSubstitute: arturo *
[6:06:16] Funsized: idk man, when you played Ron and even Snake the few times I saw you, I just fucking had to seek you out and be like "holy shit who is this guy"
[6:06:26] honorablepunk: i think sentry is rated pretty high as an rp-er, underappreciated may be more accurate
[6:06:27] FadePK: @5tolen lmfao
[6:06:38] automata93: Yeah self insertion feels kind of lame
[6:06:40] KidsSeeeGhosts: 5tolen ye I figured, easily could have clapped snake but he has plot armor EZ
[6:06:42] AzureMarquis: I'm just glad Onx lets us get fully unleashed/unrestricted characters
[6:06:48] chaosandlead: Dude you should post all of your own old clips and get fat $$$
[6:06:55] Kiddersteve: @KidsSeeeGhosts I haven't kept up with it, but at least one has happened already. There was a cache of guns and money.
[6:06:58] Samoas: how do you feel about RockStar buying FiveM?
[6:07:06] CoopTheDemon: i remember ron getting pulled over the first time he ever "borrowed" a weezle news van, the rp with that cop was great as you explained who you were to her lol
[6:07:18] honorablepunk: hey norm macdonald wasn't the biggest comedian but he was one of the most loved
[6:07:51] AndyAndyXD: @5tolen DM me on Discord

[6:09:06] Havvvy: your daughter was small.. when did she grow up man ?
[6:09:10] Samoas: HUH
[6:09:13] automata93: Your daughter should unionize her work place
[6:09:18] theglizzykisser: good choice Kreygasm
[6:09:29] bladedge28: supporting it where its something they can make more money from cuse the 5M servers are a big part of keeping this game where it is
[6:09:29] DB991: Hopefully it makes Rockstar incorporate some RP elements in to their base online so it's not just a grind fest like gra5 online.
[6:09:30] charlieblossom: sentryGrizz
[6:09:31] MasterCosmic: YEP And help pay bills...right?
