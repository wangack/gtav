[6:05:40] Dang622: it feels ooc but Jason wanted Jay gone for like two weeks lmfao
[6:05:42] FossilizedCheeto: Jay's been catching strays. Them kicking you out seems better.
[6:05:44] warnivea: why is ooc ? what happen im lost now
[6:05:47] IVoDI_Mz: they talked about it
[6:05:48] jesleaks: Vee liked u alot. It was really only Raia and Eugene pushing it

[6:05:55] Rokuach: Vee didn't want to take part on the voting
[6:05:59] Lucsvm: just stay with Malakai is the only real one
[6:06:02] Daloo9: it was mostly Jason and Raia, which are the 2 main house owners
[6:06:03] MRAPL: Raia and Jason are the majoprity stakeholders, and the leaders so they can just do it... :(
[6:06:04] DruminDriver: Probably best not to talk too much about it for it to get clipped...
[6:06:04] Kraenit: jason ic did want jay out day 1
[6:06:06] blacknoir512: naw its annoying but its not ooc

[6:06:20] warhawk384: cause jay a real crim and the others are posers
[6:06:20] QuakerG: The final drop was definitely OOC, but they have been sort of mentioning till that first time the weed stuff happened, might be good RP
[6:06:24] BROKEN335: PauseChamp

[6:06:27] simmeringteapot: Start ULTING left and right
[6:06:31] mattlau95: I don’t think it’s OOC… Jay has to ask the individuals himself
[6:06:32] Futendoji: yeeLove yeeKiss yeeLove yeeLove
[6:06:34] ashleyferns: They will eventually buy out the people not close enough - Jay was one of them SAJ
[6:06:38] simmeringteapot: go mega ult Sadge
[6:06:40] squatgains: the weed wasn’t even only Jay
[6:06:44] Neon_crunch: could you start your own group? with malakai, santi,?
[6:06:48] ArtemisRost: maybe u didnt watch their POV but since day 1 of your weed problems Jason was saying to kick Jay out <3
[6:06:48] Alaineman: This does open up other avenues
[6:06:48] tasteliketaro: you never know it could be IC
[6:06:48] mavericks312: I don’t think vee or nunu voted tbh
[6:06:50] aWildPebbleAppeared: the hate lurkers prolly drooling rn. they want the clip.
[6:06:50] Lucsvm: at least this time Jay is asking for his stuff back
[6:06:51] pilhass10: @QuakerG what OOC stuff happend?
[6:06:53] Aim_IGNITE: Are you going to come up with a villainous plan to screw them over? @kristoferyee
[6:06:58] tyty3156: what does ulting mean?
[6:06:58] Fossabot: Metagaming is providing a streamer with relayed information that was learned outside of the immediate stream and is against the rules of the NoPixel server. This includes telling where other characters are and what they have done or are doing. tiny.cc/metagaming
[6:07:02] Corvis_glyph: MalaQue are good times regardless good or bad
[6:07:06] someone_ms: remember, likely not a good idea to rant on stream
[6:07:15] blacknoir512: naw, its just jays bad luck
[6:07:17] xZRAFx: mhm
[6:07:20] doorge: dont think its ooc, they were genuine scared when u got arrested and the police showing up their house
[6:07:22] RealBalckeN: W
[6:07:23] Nickomongo: theyre also worried about grandpa and jason has said nunu is a liability
[6:07:23] Living54: wait u already knew about it?
[6:07:28] MrGyni: its not ooc, they have a reason
[6:07:32] Toxidestroy: everyone here wants you to go nuclear sheesh i dont think burning the bridges is a good idea
[6:07:32] pedro_sv03: wtf
[6:07:32] notreallynerdy: damn that was a smooth reverse
[6:07:32] simmeringteapot: Jay can still hang with them right?
[6:07:32] Echo1743: yeePop did you message the right Eugene number though
[6:07:36] YoinkDoink: damn respect
[6:07:37] unkostupit: is jay going to save up for a house?
[6:07:38] Futendoji: one door closes a new one opens, hopping for a much better one ;-) @KristoferYee
[6:07:40] Jeccc_: @Nickomongo you dont know man
[6:07:41] QuakerG: @pilhass10 Not sure if it should be mentioned in chat, but a clip that was taken a bit out of context circulated
[6:07:46] dixienormusyall: so if Jay gets caught for the warrant would he  flip on raia ?
[6:07:58] Neon_crunch: how do you know when someone is dumb or being difficult / obtuse,  or if it’s just theur RP? it probably doesn’t matter I’m guessing?  @kristoferyee
[6:07:58] RealBalckeN: Oh look Jason and raia are really sus on eugene
[6:07:59] Living54: think raia n jason thought the weed was all urs tbh
[6:07:59] Toxidestroy: eugene thinks you snitched to get out of the warrant
[6:08:00] simmeringteapot: They said only Jay kept bringing cops to the house, like the other day cops came to the house
[6:08:02] Fossabot: Confused about all these random words such as peepoSit and Chatting ? Go download the FFZ browser extensions at frankerfacez.com . Then enable 7tv and BTTV in the settings. If you are still confused watch the video on !emotehelp
[6:08:03] blackdoos: it was mainly that you were around the group less
[6:08:03] Dang622: Eugene never brought weed to the house, and they were mad about cops being brought to the house by Jay
[6:08:04] RAVE_CS2: they were scared of the police coming to the house because of you getting arrested for weed stuff
[6:08:04] squatgains: Jay got a warrant because of Raia/Nunu
[6:08:04] chaosKahn: Eugene keeps his weed in his apt
[6:08:05] MrGyni: they don't want someone part of the family to be a criminal
[6:08:07] Daloo9: they just like Eugene as a character tbh, as well as him being one of the OG members
[6:08:09] Aim_IGNITE: What reason do they have OOC to not want Jay?
[6:08:09] kujoez: Id understand if they gave you warnings then you kept doing it but you only did it once
[6:08:12] lRaiTz: There's no reason for Eugene but Nora is his GF
[6:08:15] MRAPL: Raia and Jason are just so scared cuz of the cops askin.... I dont get it
[6:08:15] Nickomongo: @Jeccc_ uhh theyve said it lol
[6:08:15] drvinnie_boombat: Nunu went from a speeding ticket to holding a cop at knife point. LUL
[6:08:16] RebelUniverse: guys he already figured it out chill
[6:08:18] pilhass10: @QuakerG k just got it
[6:08:21] symanpt: you enter the house without knowing anyone to be honest, they wanted to pay out a long time ago
[6:08:30] umudoffy: They thought it was all yours cuz Eugene said i don't bring it here. In character they don't know its Eugene's.
[6:08:35] ThirteenXXXVII: its ooc. Jason wanted jay gone for a long time and raia always defended jay
[6:08:36] jeekstapose: @MrGyni Jason literally said he'd be doing crime in few weeks
[6:08:37] Living54: @drvinnie_boombat but she was in disguise with voice changer so cops dont know nunu did that
[6:08:37] itzyoumanz: better man then me, i would get them raided and plant drugs lmao
[6:08:41] Dstabb: YIPPIE
[6:08:42] symanpt: @lRaiTz eugene just wanted to scam him 20k
[6:08:42] ArtemisRost: maybe u didnt watch their POV but since day 1 of your weed problems Jason was saying to kick jay out <3 @KristoferYee Eugene had his shit in his apartment, Nunu has just a speeding thing afaik
[6:08:45] supervan_12: Eugene has literally hung out with crew from the beginning wtf are u on about xD
[6:08:48] FossilizedCheeto: Jay brought the cops because he's got a warrant for Raia's and Nunu's muggings at the pier.
[6:08:50] squatgains: @dang622 there 350 bags that weren’t Jays… if it wasnt Eugene it was someone else inside
[6:08:52] Gtod2ndpower: "Free agent"
[6:08:53] Newyar: jay has told them all the weed wasnt all his multiple times... they just didnt care
[6:08:54] Miterex: nunu stabbed a cop twice and held one hostage lmao
[6:08:56] aWildPebbleAppeared: ive seen this happen to like 3 people with almost similar situation that groups just latch onto an excuse to kick someone out
[6:08:56] Jeccc_: @Jeccc_ ofc theyre gonna say that. just let him play dont comment on it
[6:08:56] nocturnallowl: @thirteenxxxvii  doesn't matter we're in RP rn
[6:08:57] ironbullman: how ooc come into this? sorry i dont get it
[6:08:58] HulkDiesel: The cops wanted to raid the house for the weed.
[6:09:04] fnaskdas: @thirteenxxxvii what about that makes it OOC? lol
[6:09:04] evkay: Nunu is his girl and Euguene is an og tho
[6:09:05] MrGyni: @MrGyni hes been saying that since the start
[6:09:07] L0VEL1: OMEGALOOOOL CHAT TRUSTING ANYTHING NICK SAYS
[6:09:09] Lucsvm: @HulkDiesel no they dont
[6:09:14] qihk: @Miterex but that wont get you raided
[6:09:17] Corvis_glyph: no reason om
[6:09:18] MeesterKay: frick him
[6:09:20] Chanceemergency: @chaoskahn no he actually doesn't or at least didn't until Jay got caught because 300 of those bags weren't his so had to be Eugene's lol
[6:09:24] Webb903: You don’t really hang like they do you do your own thing and they are together always bro there isn’t any hard feelings
[6:09:26] skitkall: @Living54 sheisty knows, jason even called him when the warrant was over and said "if you want me to turn her in i can" and then laughed. sheisty knows
[6:09:27] SimpOnMyShrimp: FirstTimeChatter
[6:09:28] steliokontose: nah he’s soon to be out too

[6:09:31] squatgains: Chatters be chatting honestly
[6:09:32] HulkDiesel: @Lucsvm I literally watched Jason talking to the cops
[6:09:33] Dstabb: I’m so confused about what’s happening bearDance
[6:09:33] simmeringteapot: it's because the cops came to the house twice looking for Jay no?
[6:09:34] drvinnie_boombat: @living54 that's doesn't mean she won't get caught for something like that in the future
[6:09:34] Dwarf_weed: @QuakerG can someone whisper the link to the clip please?
[6:09:34] jeekstapose: @ArtemisRost there is awarrant out for the sbs shit raia and nunu did and jay's car was flagged
[6:09:38] Wahlle: Eugene has been stirring that its suspicius about your charges being dropped
[6:09:46] DestroyerOfFatez: The only thing I disagree with is them not even letting him give his side of the story
[6:09:47] Blavod: @HulkDiesel how would they raid a house he doesn't own??
[6:09:50] sxnchez: lookBoth what in the fuck is happening FeelsDankMan
[6:09:50] Bryguy_eH: Hopppers throwing theories and lies everywhere LookUp
[6:09:50] Daloo9: @Dstabb jay got kicked out the house
[6:09:50] Karmas_Weapon: @Webb903 to be fair it's not really because of the lack of effort
[6:09:52] Lucsvm: out nowhere +300 viwers, I WONDER WY KEKW
[6:09:53] king_shadow69: maybe you shouldn't have gone ooc on the streamers?
[6:10:00] ToTheSameHeights: eugene does some good RP moments with them so they wont kick. but u right the reason was bad in character
[6:10:01] KiloCaeso: Eugene told them the weed charges didnt make sense and you might have snitched
[6:10:02] Nickomongo: @Chanceemergency yea thats the sus part.. why so many bags of weed
[6:10:04] jaswho2: eugene didnt get arrested
[6:10:06] Dstabb: raia’s house?

[6:10:12] pilhass10: @Webb903 I have the same opinion tbh, it is what it is
[6:10:13] Living54: @Living54 @skitkall suspects but cant prove, the turn her in thing was for the warrant for driving that expired that day
[6:10:14] suddenreign: they needed a scapegoat, and they werent willing to dig deep enough to blame anyone else, Jay has the least seniority and he was an easy target
[6:10:18] Kraenit: eugene set jay up
