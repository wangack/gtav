[0:20:24] PunkkRatt: Barry just approaches situations in a very different way than the cops siz usually interacts with and I think that is very fun to watch
[0:20:24] GalatiaAK: Barry feels more fun while Siz just feels like a babysitter KEKW
[0:20:25] Hazurdv: I do like how you’re a good mix of serious and character cop
[0:20:36] Vladware: Barry seems like more improv
[0:20:36] moist_sack: HoA dynamic is fun for siz, randomness of cop is fun for barry
[0:20:37] icelikesrice: There is definitely some novelty to cop due to the infrequency
[0:20:42] esrou: Things are in a good place where you can step back as Siz and let others take control
[0:20:46] h0neybadgerz: I think part of the reason is that some people don’t enjoy the meth making process, which has become a lot of the Siz RP
[0:20:48] EasyAsDan: I love how cop seems like having less responsibility than being a crim KEKW
