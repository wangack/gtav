[0:48:03] shanef8: Sam bass
[0:48:06] ffs_dave_: Kevin Ramm is a money maker…
[0:48:07] ImGenX: @SwizzMB The last time IDD woke up was to fight in the Sanguine War. He's on OW2
[0:48:13] fatcheeks305: sam baas is dead
[0:48:28] rubyn0odle: Reggie might
[0:48:29] mykeeeee_: Siz 🥲
[0:48:34] iraffis: It's hard because not going to lie i dont see allot of new ppl and most ppl are in a click
[0:48:45] kodyyy21: Bovice 100%
[0:49:00] TheViperX2: Ray would rather join Lang or start Rust
[0:49:00] eleonorljung: yep
[0:49:01] redthunder43: Tbh, I think it'll last longer than people think
[0:49:08] lurkyhound: Company lasting longer than I thought tbh lol
[0:49:13] kiri_nz: I mean hella people have already left the company
[0:49:21] hmartin317: has arnie not been streaming i used to see him on every day but havent been watching rp
[0:49:22] Swiver: curtis
[0:49:24] redthunder43: Ray, Benji and OTT will stick together imo
[0:49:29] xrush_bx: Isn't the company like 4 people
[0:49:48] xrush_bx: Ray and Benji might
[0:49:56] hydragang_: 100 p ray is would be a good member can’t cope with leader pressure
[0:50:24] shanef8: Ray really good at rp. Should rejoin back up with Lang and Toni but let them lead
[0:50:27] itsmontybwo: all of them are great gang members but they naturally lack a lil in leadership skills
[0:50:34] ImGenX: There is also Junior Meats, former BBMC Road Captain
[0:51:03] itsmontybwo: aww arnie loved junior if its the same one i remember
[0:51:12] Estimationed: Weird suggestion but Kaiba maybe
[0:51:22] eleonorljung: arnieeee huhuhu sntCry
[0:51:40] ImGenX: @Estimationed I said him and I don't think it's weird.
[0:52:10] fuzzyshoesuwu: Servers developing really slow to what I think they should have done. I wish there was more for people to do criminal wise already.
[0:52:35] ul_1998: New people in server are always refreshing
[0:52:39] iraffis: This is a weird and im not trilling Liam would be a fit for hydra but i think hé Will stad with his click
[0:52:39] kodyyy21: Bovice in Hydra would be wild LUL
[0:52:48] shanef8: Cant cus beef but Mary fully in Hydra
[0:52:54] Randeep10: nodd
[0:52:54] iraffis: Trolling*
[0:52:55] turntablist_mk2: they needed to establish the cops, so the timing is good but grindy.
[0:53:08] kiri_nz: I'm interested to see how Addison goes with the group
[0:53:08] itsmontybwo: and also with the boys that havent been around, its doesnt exactly fit their characters personalities. its grind-heavy and they just love to fk around and have fun
[0:53:51] xAbsoluteNoob: how about that benny guy u guys rolled on for wanting to know hes name
[0:54:03] MadnessQuotient: the low volume of guns is great tbh
[0:54:14] AlbyNz: I think 3.0 was way better when the went back to pistols
[0:54:16] xrush_bx: Surprised they didn't slap a 100k gun licence and make it 10k per gun and only 1 a day
[0:54:23] fuzzyshoesuwu: Seeing the trailer for 4.0, made me thing it was more rust like of finding things in the open but right now theres nothing.
[0:54:30] ImGenX: TBH, during the last few months of 3.0 Kaiba was more Bondi Til I Die than most BBMC.
[0:54:43] AtteTheBear: Guns should take 11 hours to craft
[0:55:02] AtteTheBear: AFAIK they cant take days because the crafting que doesnt carry over resets
[0:55:05] hmartin317: ya going to be interesting on how guns and stuff made since everyone has bench
[0:55:07] TheViperX2: it should be expensive
[0:55:11] 100rc: a system like old bobcat would be good, 2 week cooldown regardless if u succeed or fail
[0:55:14] Shanky_k: Kinda wishes y'all claimed a southside turf.. coz like 3.0 yu will get the itch of moving to the soutside..
[0:55:16] eleonorljung: yeah the new monkey guy is gonna change a lot I think,  he even looks like flippster sntGiggle sntGiggle
[0:55:18] fuzzyshoesuwu: weed takes what 4 days to dry, guns should be longer
[0:55:23] iraffis: Lets be honest you still need to get the materialen to craft
[0:55:34] shanef8: Realise a gun every 6/9 storms
[0:55:35] atrollusername: @AtteTheBear the work around that would be crafting parts first
[0:55:38] Tempah___: I kinda hope it’s blueprints for each part of the gun
[0:55:40] turntablist_mk2: easy to code a countdown check and restart
[0:55:59] HEGGA: With the crafting que it would be awkward to wait days to craft anything if you wanna craft a gun though
[0:56:00] ImGenX: LUL
[0:56:01] xrush_bx: LUL
[0:56:09] HEGGA: Maybe you'll need 2 benches?
[0:56:11] TheViperX2: what about DDR?
[0:56:13] redthunder43: What type of heists would you like?
[0:56:18] AlbyNz: brain surgeon or 120 wpm at typing
[0:56:26] xrush_bx: I mean he
[0:56:30] turntablist_mk2: just make it faster as u get xp
[0:56:35] xrush_bx: Heist should be more team based
[0:56:42] ul_1998: There's people that enjoy those hacks to be fair
[0:56:43] hmartin317: ya my brain dosent work like that could never be any kind of hacker for old hacks
[0:56:49] AloofMango: @HEGGA then you get more t3 unless it limited per house
[0:56:51] xrush_bx: Like puzzle shit or something
[0:57:01] TheViperX2: Like the VR heist
[0:57:14] fuzzyshoesuwu: I miss the car chases really. Right now even a speeding ticket is insane to see anyone run from the cops.
[0:57:15] MadnessQuotient: teamwork and communication should be the keys to heists imo.
[0:57:17] AloofMango: yea? lol
[0:57:24] austin__21: like the old bobcat? was that good
[0:58:13] AloofMango: KEKW

[0:59:33] TheViperX2: I liked the VR heist
[0:59:46] AlbyNz: Especially when devs were makin it harder for some groups #outburst
[0:59:48] Donj97: nah the yatch was bad
[0:59:56] ann_canada: it will be interesting to see what the heists will be like
[0:59:57] blackgate64: i hate the algebra calculus da vinci puzzle style heists i wish they were more like bobcat
[1:00:00] austin__21: bobcat
[1:00:10] fatcheeks305: yacht laptops were harddd
[1:00:58] AlbyNz: you reckon dev should make 4head the benchmark for IQ to do heists so every can do it

[4:39:29] iraffis: Oké look im not saving wat she did was wrong but some stuff she did was a little questionable
[4:39:31] BakinPacman: no what i mean is that the community throws around the stigma
[4:39:32] jayelay: pacman your digging your own grave here imma be honest
[4:39:36] TenkSyncri: I think Ruth is so good she bring alot off spice.
[4:39:42] kodyyy21: LUL
[4:39:47] BeckaPurce: people aren’t used to not having a push over in charge of pd, ‘call slacks’ is the new call baas

[4:40:07] BakinPacman: she is a strong woman
[4:40:10] BakinPacman: basically
[4:40:11] nobodypopsoff_: Are you or flippy going to ask may or Mary I'd they want to come back to hydra or are you guys letting them do their thing with kaneshiro
[4:40:15] heater1090: @swizzmb she’s not a leader
[4:40:15] Tempah___: Ruth is being that strict cop that takes no shit from anyone unlike someone who folds to everything
[4:40:19] Gnomeunknown: tbh Ruth didn’t do anything she’s taking all the agro from others
[4:40:37] BakinPacman: turner is also not a pushover
[4:40:38] Tempah___: she is a leader
[4:40:42] eleonorljung: yeah you scared me there for a moment bakin sntGiggle
[4:40:45] cubecorp__: w chaser

[4:41:04] Lozza_95: scrajj
[4:41:06] BakinPacman: if they met turner during their shift PepeLaugh
[4:41:06] heater1090: she wants to be big man but id think she ca handle it
[4:41:12] nbd_casual: Shes not even tht bad but shes very inconsistent
[4:41:14] dirtyboyz09: anyone see ramee fighting speedys warrant?
[4:41:14] BakinPacman: they would be shocked
[4:41:19] Tempah___: nothing
[4:41:25] heater1090: nor the raid
[4:41:29] BVNISH: Ruth is the boogeyman of 4.0 - that's all there is to it
[4:41:30] heater1090: not*
[4:41:36] BakinPacman: lots of assumptions happen
[4:41:43] Tempah___: he got caught with a gun cause he was gun downed and they couldn’t chase Mary etc that’s it
[4:41:52] FlyingGirl18: FlyingGirl18 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months! swizzmFLWR
[4:41:54] kodyyy21: K's side of it i think that he's upset that she cuffed/Frisk only some people there and not everybody picking and choosing that's what i got from it
[4:42:00] eleonorljung: swizzmHeart swizzmHeart swizzmHeart
[4:42:06] spacebunz666: if you guys explain yourselves in full sentences it would probably work better lol
[4:42:23] dirtyboyz09: speedys warrant was no evidence all guesses and voice recognition
[4:42:26] BakinPacman: crims have yet to realize that doing crime is bad for being a civ

[4:42:38] bonedead: EZ
[4:42:38] spacebunz666: lollll
[4:42:44] Tempah___: the thing is with the other people on scene is they fled and couldn’t chase that’s why they weren’t searched
[4:42:47] ofr4nk13o: all I know is a lot of crims/civs and cops don’t like her
[4:42:58] BeckaPurce: slacks let k go and Ruth still pushed to raid him, that’s an L on slacks that Ruth is getting the shit for
[4:43:03] eleonorljung: that's the real miguel right there bruuuther
[4:43:08] BVNISH: the character Mr. K refuses to acknowledge that he was part of a violent felony situation and got patted down for it.
[4:43:09] ZenoflareZ: They need a leader and not a council kg 3 captains
[4:43:11] BakinPacman: they would hate turner if he was around during their shift
[4:43:21] cubecorp__: ruth put a warrant out while k and ramee was in the PD while defending dundee
[4:43:24] itsbluejean: I don't see why anyone would hate on her tbh. Watched her stream a few times and she seems very fair
[4:43:41] shanef8: @swizzmb Don't know full context but think it from when K got gun down by Mary and K has lot of weirdo views so she's taken full blame cus she's in charge
[4:43:47] BakinPacman: him and the HOA
[4:43:52] heater1090: it’s not that she raid it’s the fact that she did all this in a weird manner imo like push a warrant out that was already severed mind you. and she knew she was in the wrong and bass and other cops said she was in the wrong
[4:43:53] BakinPacman: he was the boogeyman
[4:43:53] dydasdydulis: she put him on a 24h hold because they could not find his houses and didint even question yeager and Mary
[4:44:01] Tempah___: Jp is mad that Ruth didn’t do anything to speedy when he got beat down when it was just her on scene and jp just shot a gun
[4:44:04] FLv_Smoke: Imo its alot of cry baby cheesing
[4:44:15] ZenoflareZ: No
[4:44:16] berfsta82: he didt like how he was cooking McNulty as legal aide for Dundee shit. she then pushed a warrant with him at mrpd
[4:44:19] eleonorljung: i love iceman/captain turner as a cop and RP:er swizzmHeart
[4:44:21] iraffis: I think they are Just mad that X got caught with a PD glock and didnt get raided and with mr k got raided
[4:44:26] BakinPacman: yeah the trolling k didnt help the situation
[4:44:34] kessy1893: mary went to pd after and gave a statement
[4:44:34] spacebunz666: sounds like a lot of people whining to me
[4:44:34] BakinPacman: and cops are using the tools they are being slowly given
[4:44:35] Randeep10: swizzmBINO swizzmBINO
[4:44:37] ZenoflareZ: He trolled but they trolled and mechanics didn't help
[4:44:44] BakinPacman: cops do not have all the tools yet
[4:45:05] BVNISH: PD doesn't have the mechanic to figure out where properties are exactly and K refused to tell them, so he got put on a hold until PD figured that out
[4:45:32] BakinPacman: flippy where art though
[4:45:34] Shanky_k: People forget Bayo and JP shift 3 shenanigans..
[4:46:14] ZenoflareZ: Solomon found the property in a few seconds
[4:46:14] khaled_5655: FLOPPPY swizzmBINO
[4:46:18] jayelay: People just need to realize that if streamers make a statement viewers dont need to make things a bigger deal cause it will just ruin even more situations in the future by having a bad vibe around the roleplay itself.... theres a reason theres an age restriction to who can play on the server
[4:46:19] Shanky_k: Bayo was JPs kryptonite
[4:46:53] berfsta82: i mean she also voice id speedy to push a warrent rsmee was heated over that one
[4:47:01] dirtyboyz09: why dont people see the best rp comes out of these conflicts
[4:47:06] ZenoflareZ: Xice cops are strict but fun to conflict with
[4:47:10] BakinPacman: its not just voice id
[4:47:13] iraffis: Im putting my money on Jordan
[4:47:20] BakinPacman: timmac and pidgeon is the best example
[4:47:22] bonedead: :)
[4:47:26] Tempah___: she literally had 2 points of evidence for voice id
[4:47:46] BakinPacman: remember how mack was able to articulate it was pidgeon on scene at the airport
[4:47:48] Tempah___: which is allowed
[4:47:50] BakinPacman: its not just voice
[4:48:02] berfsta82: @bakinpacman  yes i know she used cloths after. problem is speedy is a ped he has 4 outfits
[4:48:08] iraffis: Flash back to vinny rmb goodwan
[4:48:22] Tempah___: and?
[4:48:28] Randeep10: swizzmFP swizzmFP
[4:48:32] kiri_nz: I don't think he was angry about voice ID more so that the judge just said....no bench he's guilty, appeal it
[4:48:34] bonedead: didnt speedy also take her on a date lol
[4:48:51] BakinPacman: take a step back and think for a second LUL
[4:49:15] BVNISH: the CG vs KC conflict is super fun, minus the cringy RP critics
[4:49:21] arocket25: viewers need to chill and enjoy the show that’s all
[4:49:27] BakinPacman: yeah its wild
[4:49:29] berfsta82: i think it’s been great rp IC
[4:49:30] BakinPacman: LUL
[4:49:34] Randeep10: it’s unnecessary, it’s a game lol
[4:49:47] sim_m02: the cops are doing their job and viewers going crazy
[4:49:49] ofr4nk13o: I also don’t think it helps that it’s been situations with the 2 biggest streamers in the server
[4:49:53] BakinPacman: ramee is gonna get busted soon
[4:49:57] eleonorljung: i already love fing fing as a cop sntGiggle
[4:50:00] BakinPacman: he skirts the line PepeLaugh
[4:50:03] kessy1893: but isnt that just the bad cg chatters? everyone that gets in to conflict with k gets shit everytime...

[4:56:46] ofr4nk13o: I just think nopixel would still be as popular
[4:56:52] kgenera: koil did say 4.0 was funded by public servers
[4:57:15] BakinPacman: He called them white knights basically which is kinda iffy but hydra does protect their family and relations
[4:57:16] smalls_94: X was the launchpad for R P
[4:57:23] ofr4nk13o: yeah I forgot in early 3.0 he was pulling insane viewers
[4:57:31] BakinPacman: theres a reason why hydra made so many good business moves

[5:04:20] BakinPacman: Buddha is living his retirement life
[5:04:23] lucho724_: as much as the pog stuff is good, the slower times allow for chat interaction and that’s not bad imo
[5:04:29] kessy1893: lang and co do most of their meetings while selling what makes it really funny
[5:04:38] SchnitzleKing: it was S+ to meth run to S++, just very fast everything

[5:05:07] lucho724_: brotha we all used to watch you do 4 labs back to back, shit can’t get much slower
[5:05:10] BakinPacman: Hydra have always been so solid as a gang which is kinda funny
[5:05:11] rempits: really?
[5:05:16] isias2: Because of the ATMS and organization when you guys rolled out that day
[5:05:23] BVNISH: ahead in what?

[5:05:24] Unk0010: Is not even that they're ahead, is that they can be ahead quick af
[5:05:25] dirtyboyz09: i think as a viewer we need the context of what the grind is like to understand the value of characters time and  their spending
[5:05:28] Hazetheking: yup
[5:05:29] mojjo627: Hydra has been more consistent in the last few weeks
[5:05:34] BakinPacman: They just get the shit done as it is needed
[5:05:44] lucho724_: it’s the self sufficiency of the group
[5:05:45] rempits: offline xdd
[5:05:46] kessy1893: focusing on weed and gpus was big
[5:05:53] lucho724_: you guys have an entire self eco system

[5:07:52] movin100: the Lester unlock early was huge for Hydra
[5:07:53] BakinPacman: There is only so much you can do as the single party
[5:07:58] BeckaPurce: especially early on, people remember months down the line about first connections
[5:07:59] lucho724_: you actually flipped me with your points in the polish thing
[5:08:06] TekEvolution: First was weed run scuff then it became the room scuff
[5:08:08] BakinPacman: When people see you as the top contender
[5:08:17] lucho724_: I thought it was good until you made your points

[5:09:04] Hazetheking: polish are cool tho
[5:09:21] BakinPacman: yeah flippy just throws out the ideas to feel how the gang feels
[5:09:58] BakinPacman: its kinda hard to know exactly what will happen overall
[5:10:12] rempits: yesss good RP nodd
[5:10:24] BakinPacman: did you figure out if the turf rep / individual rep / strain rep affected the price?
[5:10:29] isias2: You guys try to solve the new dongle puzzle yet?
[5:10:39] rempits: OMEGALUL
[5:10:42] pixalie: scuffed ass trains smh
[5:11:02] BakinPacman: they cant get the dongle
[5:11:03] Cambellar: my thought on it was that with them pushing your weed it ments them not conflicting with your weed if they had their own on the same block  becasue they wanted to push on forum
[5:11:14] SchnitzleKing: where is bro running btw
[5:11:25] dirtyboyz09: could you not have your strain and turf and they have same and agree like a defence alliance? with the polles
[5:11:27] BakinPacman: i think strain rep keeps it from being snitched on etc as often
[5:12:05] BakinPacman: its just hard to tell it will all play out
[5:12:11] BakinPacman: how it all*
[5:12:23] BakinPacman: yeah
[5:12:35] rempits: i just hope the Pols becoming Hydra street team its gonna be BIG for 4.0 Prayge
[5:12:38] Cambellar: and that headache of regorwing is a valid concern for sure
[5:12:40] dirtyboyz09: just help each other to defend each others own turf?
[5:12:40] isias2: Sr buns makes more money than weed anyway

[5:13:55] Hazetheking: yes that would be interesting situation
[5:13:55] rempits: yea
[5:14:16] Hazetheking: but it would both be your turf no?
[5:14:28] Cambellar: wouldnt it be the same as when you were watching rust compound being raided with like 20 people and someone came up to shoo out all up when you a had like 4 gangs there
[5:14:30] BakinPacman: imagine if someone attacked and 10 people are pushing
[5:14:33] hallabckman: will you ever rp with cg again seriously? I know y’all broke off the relationship but I miss the vibes
[5:14:36] BakinPacman: can all 10 defend LUL

[5:24:16] ZenoflareZ: Ya a bit more wild than Mary asking you guys to get Arrowhead knowing it will conflict with Vinny. Then taking advantage of how you don't know
[5:24:24] lucho724_: nothing like a classic pistons loyalty check
[5:24:47] rempits: i mean at the end of the day xdd
[5:24:50] BakinPacman: Dundee just makes things LUL
[5:25:02] dizzledaz: not only that the joseph arrowhead thing was technically purely transactional. you wanted a gun. mary had one but she wanted arrowhead. miguel got him for the gun
