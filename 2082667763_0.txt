[3:42:34] DirtorBust: Ahhh is that why he sounds kinda bummed out?
[3:42:54] Abucus23: yeah I’d be ok with the rp just because what would even be the punishment?
[3:43:04] v__i__c__i__o__u__s: I mean accidental pistol whipping happens irl all the time and the perpetrator forgives them, its understandable when u misclick even irl

[3:48:09] Abucus23: having to pay 5000$ for pistol whipping a guy in cuffs is actually an easy out.
[3:48:45] Azzzuare: @Mutchluv89 understandable but the problem was that gta game control makes it way to easy for that to happen so a precedent like this can suck the enjoyment out of it especially for something that was an accident
