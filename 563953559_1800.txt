[0:42:11] BandaiNenzai: No character deaths, just Tian Gong is seemingly disintergrated
[0:42:26] moo_of_doom: this fight its likely everyone dies or nobody dies
[0:42:36] NiteLiteDF: He said Nova actually let go of it though, that just she experienced it as disintegrating
[0:42:44] moo_of_doom: trial and all that
[0:42:45] NiteLiteDF: so its probably on the floor
[0:42:49] Greinhed: ouch, poor Nova monkaS
[0:43:11] alizarincrimson_: I doubt anyone will actually die though, they'll just fail the trial and be thrown out of the simulation
[0:43:37] Nightjar: The trial is designed for Guardians though, so it's possible it could have ill effects for non-Guardians
[0:43:39] BandaiNenzai: The safety of the non-guardian characters is not guaranteed
