[0:49:57] maggiras: the only thing delivery drivers interact with is people try to rob them .. @GTAWiseGuy
[0:50:18] 07racingchris: What about local Butcher for hunters
[0:50:20] ChrisFoster: So like pick up multiple packages/crates and go out on a delivery route to multiple businesses? That's a great idea!
[0:50:29] dripydryp: i would love to see food supply shortages
[0:50:34] dripydryp: could be good rp

[1:00:17] Cobrian: @Vondill That would be the end-goal for sure, but you need a really mature server for something like that. I'd say have an emergency rations system but make those rations be ass, for staying alive only.

[7:08:48] BornAGosu: @jbaugh just pay royalties to actors for using their face
[7:08:57] fourthwright: @jbaugh this makes no sense because AI cant generate new content, only uses what already exists
[7:08:57] DrNycoleGreen: Lawd are you going to bed sir!!!!!!!!!!!!
[7:09:03] Spikee439: official water marks are going to be a thing
[7:09:05] coyotes____: Bedge
[7:09:21] MrSym: GTA7 will be made entirely by AI Kappa
[7:09:25] roguegunslinger1: Nah because we will make AI that is perfect at detecting AI.
[7:09:25] Polaflex: You will always need them imo just to manage it, but most artists will need to become compliant in AI to keep their jobs
[7:09:27] alexjnr7: Movies are about to change a whole lot too
[7:09:54] MrSym: @Polaflex Yeah I think a lot will have to just transition their skillset to accompany AI, instead of trying to fight against it
[7:09:56] Kemli: it's so rough , even when you think that the AI is drawing from existing art
[7:09:59] fourthwright: again AI cant make new content, art and videos are based off already existing art and videos
[7:10:00] roguegunslinger1: Yeah art for profit is fucked by AI.
[7:10:01] Kemli: it's sad
[7:10:02] Polaflex: @Polaflex Agreed
[7:10:03] jbaugh: @fourthwright maybe not an entire AI generated movie but they could save a lot of money using it, just like when CGI got good
[7:10:10] RevilTheDevil: gta7 made by ai
[7:10:10] different_than_weird: so on that note...
[7:10:13] Kemli: yeaa
[7:10:22] DrNycoleGreen: Look you know, when they in the US admitted Aliens existed we weren't even surprised!!
[7:10:31] ShiftyD84: we'll get GTA 7 in no time YEP
[7:10:43] fourthwright: ai should be used as a tool not used entirely to make things imo
[7:10:57] DrNycoleGreen: Yes you are! You will have to adapt
[7:10:59] MrSym: Watch WG use AI to fill his facecam so he doesn't have to
[7:11:00] MrSym: KEKW
[7:11:02] 07racingchris: Rockstar has said they use ai to help build gta 6
