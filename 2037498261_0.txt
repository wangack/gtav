[0:48:09] spookyghost21: Aziz has the PTSD from past experience lol
[0:48:11] Koll0: The reason there's so much writing is because of people being afraid of bad reports
[0:48:14] LordOfTT: "there's too much info reading is hard" seems like a bad criticism of a report :(
[0:48:15] mrperson1234: Maybe have a narrative document written like this and a condensed version?
[0:48:34] LordOfTT: they're judges they read all day that's 80% of the job

[0:49:09] mrperson1234: @LordOfTT There are laws IRL that are hundreds of thousands of pages of text. Knowing how to simplify into important details is needed

[0:49:41] Jorpa: Its better to overachieve then underachieve
[0:49:50] LordOfTT: ok that's like 5 mins of reading that's not hard?
[0:49:53] mrperson1234: @LordOfTT Needs important details but not anything unimportant
[0:49:59] Sparbro2: This seems pretty realistic, I imagine IRL they would look closer to that
[0:49:59] WildWillie419: He’s scared he needs that much to get it approved because everything is scrutinized and this is a new precedent
[0:50:05] LordOfTT: don't be a judge if you don't want to spend the time to learn all the details :)
[0:50:08] FizzDidThis: its really pretty looking at least
[0:50:17] InvictoNZ: changed a raid hold into a paperwork hold, just do a warrant and raid

[0:58:23] mrperson1234: Does JP have two warrants or only 1? A cop was saying 1 earlier but that sounds wrong
[0:58:24] nickgmiller: lol Ruth just read your mind

[1:00:33] Koll0: What constitutes normal evading? Staying on the right side of the road, stopping at lights etc.? There's no way an evasion isn't reckless the moment it starts unless crims want to lose on purpose

[1:13:46] hyotee: he believed it they had no serial numbers
[1:13:53] dakota22446: saabOwo
[1:13:53] eqnjn: @humanhere2 True, no one can make the claim it is or isn't there, so it's not necessarily a lie, it's also just unable to be proven
[1:13:54] hyotee: its different than lying
[1:13:57] detoksi: how does cash lose serial numbers if its just rolled cash is the point
[1:13:57] nationas: this a mechanic that sucks LUL

[1:15:11] Blair63: @tim212_ probably brand new not like decayed how items decay
[1:15:18] lookingfornothinghere: thats the thing why isnt it true the item also doesnt look dry so its up to someones roleplay
[1:15:19] mrperson1234: It's hard to defend that as not being lying
[1:15:24] seanlew123: wait don't they arrest for dirty money
[1:15:27] buddha_hands: wouldnt it be worth messaging norman to clear it up
[1:15:33] NSAne93: so cop stating what he knows to be truth means he is lying....
[1:15:34] tim212_: @blair63 sure but how would he know that
[1:15:38] wenngren: there is a charge for it tho LUL
[1:15:43] TheTourist_: @seanlew123 good saabHappy how about you?

[1:15:47] seanlew123: right that is what confuses me
[1:15:51] seanlew123: i am doing good thank u
[1:15:57] hyotee: its like saying snr buns employee says the sprunk has ice but the customer doesnt know it himself
[1:15:58] mrperson1234: @NSAne93 He doesnt know any of that. It would at best be META
[1:15:59] octagonner: @NSAne93 the entire argument is if he knows it to be true or not lmao
[1:16:00] Sparbro2: Giving it back proves yall are wrong tho

[1:16:36] seanlew123: don't they arrest for rolled up money as dirty money i am confused
[1:16:36] slomojosh: like Aziz literally has a washer
[1:16:37] buddha_hands: you don't see serials on normal money either so idk how that could come into play
[1:16:37] nationas: this is a bit yikes with the money stuff
[1:16:40] WildWillie419: Huh? the charge says to take it tho?
[1:16:51] wavep987: Didn't Knight get a person to confirm that yesterday?
[1:16:52] BakinPacman: the dossier was all he said she said stuff
[1:16:56] tim212_: @wildwillie419 yes but you need to charge it to cross it
[1:16:56] buddha_hands: @slomojosh oh yeah forgot there's a dossier lol
[1:17:00] CuBanMumzy: i thought the case Brian was working on it proved it was marijuana money?
[1:17:01] tim212_: take*
[1:17:03] mrperson1234: @seanlew123 No. Rolls are not illegal to have currently and should not be taken
[1:17:10] Serakkis: @seanlew123 it's a little difficult, in this new server it hasn't been established the rolled notes are related solely to crime
[1:17:12] octagonner: @WildWillie419 take what? the money in the bag is just money, they need to prove its dirty money
[1:17:15] seanlew123: thank u for answeing me

[1:17:47] Scully_18: It’s all bullshit bro

[7:20:10] peqoud22: @wavep987 Only in searches when doing terry frisks.  Crane said that when it comes to the scope of a search warrant that it isn't right.
