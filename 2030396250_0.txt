[2:22:57] Archangel3003: @devintalktech The whole point is that the name is a play on words and is meant as harmless humor. A joke. Satire. Simple as that. Also when Andrews first heard, he was making jokes about Cornwood saying "laying down".

[4:49:31] foxweazel: @zilzgaming That's the law. If you waive those rights, the cops then have to clearly state the implications of that decision, to make sure you're doing it "intelligently". If you then still waive your rights, the coos are good to go. But if they never took that step, it can be ruled inadmissible by a judge

[9:26:21] RetPaladinBot: After getting these numbers we find find the average flaccid penis size ( 3.61 ) and divide the average erect penis size (5.16) and do the following: 5.16/3.61 to get the soft to erect ratio. 5.16/3.61=1.42 inches erect for every inch soft. So we take esfands soft/slight chub size of 5.71 and multiply it by 1.42 to find his erect size. 5.71*1.42= 8.1

[9:29:13] MistaMista: After getting these numbers we find find the average flaccid penis size ( 3.61 ) and divide the average erect penis size (5.16) and do the following: 5.16/3.61 to get the soft to erect ratio. 5.16/3.61=1.42 inches erect for every inch soft. So we take esfands soft/slight chub size of 5.71 and multiply it by 1.42 to find his erect size. 5.71*1.42= 8.1
