[2:08:47] PlethoraOfBees: I did the nerd math. Assuming market fees of 15% (I don't know what it actually is) the oil stocks won't make any profit until the price is at least $97.83. At $100 he'd make about a $400 profit MathLady
[2:08:50] Clairbear89: hi @gawlitoo
[2:09:09] sBuon: @PlethoraOfBees AAAA
[2:09:16] Clairbear89: @PlethoraOfBees my head hurts now.
[2:09:43] sBuon: @PlethoraOfBees basically you're saying he should buy more shares each time if he actually wants to make money?
[2:09:50] JediJacob_: duncan is a good egg
[2:09:55] themanwithanrx7: do we know if there are fees ?
[2:10:05] themanwithanrx7: Market transaction fees, income tax
[2:10:08] WhosHumble: the fee is really bad ngl
[2:10:09] PlethoraOfBees: @themanwithanrx7 I know there are fees. I just don't know what they are. I guessed 15%
[2:10:19] Bearlylurking: I think it's 10%?
[2:10:21] random_viewer_55: 5%
[2:10:25] random_viewer_55: it seems
[2:10:28] sBuon: wait
[2:10:29] Bearlylurking: not bad
[2:10:33] sBuon: just put a normal number
[2:10:36] sBuon: ike 10

[2:10:38] xTurqeh: 5%
[2:10:40] sBuon: so we can see the percent
[2:10:50] random_viewer_55: its 5%
[2:10:51] sBuon: there we go lol
[2:11:09] sBuon: Bees has to do math again now AAAA
[2:11:10] themanwithanrx7: but do you also pay income tax on teh gains? lol
[2:11:11] PlethoraOfBees: At 5% fee you make a profit at $87.53
[2:11:28] PlethoraOfBees: $100 would be about a $2500 profit
[2:11:30] Bearlylurking: @PlethoraOfBees HUHH
[2:11:41] Bearlylurking: @PlethoraOfBees oh, gotcha
[2:11:43] sBuon: @PlethoraOfBees so basically he's only taking out small shares thus making little to no mone yright?
[2:11:50] sBuon: * money right?

[2:13:11] PlethoraOfBees: @sBuon If you take the average share price he's bought at, he needs to sell at 5% higher than that before it starts making a profit. Right now the average share price he bought in at is $83.15 so at $87.52 he'll start making a profit
[2:13:42] sBuon: @PlethoraOfBees so TDLR... yes?

[2:14:36] magnets_: security guard stretching at the same time lmfao
[2:14:39] sBuon: @PlethoraOfBees basically he's not buying enough shares to make enough of/a crazy a profit
[2:14:46] Clairbear89: You got this!
[2:14:58] Kiester_Felterbutts: Take a couple of shots
[2:15:04] SushiShad: Ayoooo, we starting a zoomba stream?
[2:15:04] PlethoraOfBees: @sBuon He's making a percentage profit. More shares = more profit so sort of
[2:15:20] FlameReetardantPanda: @Kiester_Felterbutts SNIFFA
[2:15:56] sBuon: @PlethoraOfBees what's his % total on the shares he's bought if it got to 100?
[2:16:16] sBuon: yeah 5%, I assume Bees already took that into account
[2:16:45] themanwithanrx7: Kian just needs insider info
[2:16:55] themanwithanrx7: There's no SEC in LS to stop it :D

[7:57:53] uknwwhtshedidurhauntingd: ltcustHappyCustard harrL harrL harrL harrWarry
[7:57:59] malone9807: the fact that it happened at the storm is so annoying to me, if the situation had more time to flesh out a certain someone would have been caught in 4k, but it is what it is, it is still very fun to watch how you roll with it
[7:58:06] alman22: ok
[7:58:35] VSDuck: Don't you *have to go for sales first?
[7:58:35] random_viewer_55: @malone9807 ye its annoying but can't do much abou it
[7:58:40] beardedvamp: Okay I do have a question then.. If you had 2 statements (1 from benji 1 from ray) saying it was just them, but harry says there was 3, how do you determine who to listen to in that case is my question i guess
[7:58:54] themanwithanrx7: the case will be built, they'll slip eventually
[7:58:57] Jaxiball: has McNulty been able to talk to Lang as well yet?
[7:59:02] malone9807: true
[7:59:08] dylanconlon6: do a highway run with this car

[7:59:43] SimplyOrt: @dluo15 a gun
[7:59:50] powerfeiz: if you don't get the L's the W's don't mean anything
[7:59:52] xzack04x: the shooter can be from the harry group?
[7:59:52] IsaackEz: Sucks that tsunami hit
[7:59:55] SimpOnMyShrimp: So at least 2 shooters
[7:59:58] bird24287: @simplyort lol
[8:00:02] Zorfianna: borpaSpin SNIFFA so many to sniff
[8:00:05] lightstormclaw: @Sirlambsalot its rng based buddy
[8:00:06] sBuon: @SimpOnMyShrimp HUHH
[8:00:07] criticalvaluexx: did ray or benji get shot?
[8:00:09] CanWarfare: Who died?
[8:00:11] random_viewer_55: @xzack04x no they were all GSR negative
[8:00:12] LOLolsen: can you take voice ID from a crim and use it as testimony?
[8:00:14] CowboyRoyce: @xzack04x theres no evidence of that
[8:00:22] dluo15: benji and ray had gunshot wounds
[8:00:23] Lilliphus: @LOLolsen not as testimony no
[8:00:25] LoonyToon: The grassy bull the second shooter saabW
[8:00:26] sBuon: @LOLolsen not
[8:00:26] spuds3432: Gotta remember that chatters have a lot more context as to what is going on because they meta. Streamers dont have that meta, so they do the best they can to solve these things. That's what makes the RP so much fun!
[8:00:31] LoonyToon: Null
[8:00:38] Denraoden: Rya said he was stabbed and beji said shot no?
[8:00:42] Denraoden: ray*
[8:00:46] SurvivorPlayz999: didn’t benji and ray say they got shot at from the roof or no?
[8:00:50] VSDuck: @LOLolsen it would be SUPER weak
[8:00:52] SimpOnMyShrimp: Oh they could climb on roof i gues
[8:00:52] beardedvamp: So just so i dont ruin anything, how many people were found on scene? Benji, Ray, Ash, Harry, Dougie, did you find anybody else?
[8:00:53] kool_guy: AAAA
[8:00:53] xscoxevox: Do you have suspects?
[8:00:53] Nightbot: AAAA
[8:00:53] CowboyRoyce: but McNulty can now use that to investigate chat
[8:00:55] malone9807: voice id is basically hearsay
[8:01:06] Originnal: thats why its all scuffed
[8:01:08] bird24287: Harry could have said the moon is green and that’s his testimony lol
[8:01:11] Lilliphus: o7
[8:01:12] Sirlambsalot: @lightstormclaw Seems spammy for the cops to deal with
[8:01:17] Konkwistador_1002: im sorry but but wounds are facts, shouldt that be ooc given info?
[8:01:22] Palizangetsu: @beardedvamp no
[8:01:22] amber_bijoux: plus even harry said he and benji took each other out by stabbing
[8:01:26] Nightbot: Come join the discord and fill up the ranks! https://discord.gg/PMrxK3F
[8:01:28] SurvivorPlayz999: SeriousSloth
[8:01:32] skinnylegend000: criminal on criminal voice ID is similar to saying they’re wearing a specific outfit.  it’s one piece not complete PC.
[8:01:39] SurvivorPlayz999: didn’t benji and ray say they got shot at from the roof or no?
[8:01:41] ShadesDown: it helps form the picture it’s not the whole picture
[8:01:46] LOLolsen: @malone9807 this is a great rule for rp I even think face ID shouldnt be 100%
[8:01:49] VSDuck: @Konkwistador_1002 Custy knows what the wounds are just not who has what wounds
[8:01:50] dylanconlon6: it’s if it matches with other statements aswell
[8:02:09] VSDuck: @LOLolsen 100% agreed
[8:02:35] Konkwistador_1002: @Konkwistador_1002 well they would know who they were if there was more time so it should be ooc given info no?
[8:02:46] beardedvamp: Thank you for answering so many questions. I do appreciate it.
[8:02:50] Lilliphus: i love investigation rp
[8:02:51] LOLolsen: @VSDuck its a big city people look similar
[8:03:01] popa_jr: is it possible to do a sting operation?
[8:03:10] sBuon: RIPBOZO
[8:03:23] malone9807: if it had just 10-20 more minutes to flesh out it would have been soo good
[8:03:26] kool_guy: AAAA
[8:03:26] Nightbot: AAAA
[8:03:35] themanwithanrx7: The dispatch call doesn't give you pc to enter?
[8:03:40] Lilliphus: u good bwo?
[8:03:47] VSDuck: @Konkwistador_1002 mmm that's kinda hard but I'd say no because McNulty didn't learn it. Just because there wasn't enough time doesn't mean the info should just be given out right?
[8:04:24] Originnal: you are kinda missing a lot of evidence because of the wave which sucks
[8:04:27] elpio123: it all bad timing
[8:04:33] DangersClose: With the investigation, why does it not matter that Benji and Raymond where shot at the scene?
[8:04:38] VSDuck: sniffthenewchatter
[8:04:41] Konkwistador_1002: @VSDuck idk, i thought all evedence that would have been gathered if not for the storm should be ooc give to police?
[8:04:43] malone9807: it will happen again don't worry LUL
[8:04:46] kool_guy: does pd have tech for finding casings?
[8:05:00] SimplyOrt: hopefulyyyy if a crim is gonna plan a shootout they are a little more aware of the time
[8:05:00] ashadee63: bring Ramee to say it is eugene case closed
[8:05:08] themanwithanrx7: no @kool_guy
[8:05:12] DangersClose: WTF you saw them shot on the ground though?
[8:05:18] Lilliphus: sus LUL
[8:05:25] Originnal: impersonating a police officer?
[8:05:30] skinnylegend000: we all know somehow this will be blamed on Eugene Zuckerberg.
[8:05:31] Originnal: LUL
[8:05:33] sBuon: oop
[8:05:35] VSDuck: @Konkwistador_1002 that would make sense and they could do it that way but I guess they just didn't (Not sure if they talked with admins on it or not)
[8:05:41] Lilliphus: @Originnal security guard, prolly g6
[8:05:43] Palizangetsu: @Konkwistador_1002 no things typically end at tsunami, ooc info shouldn't be given it would get a bit more awkward cuz officers can miss evidence or forget to collect something otherwise.
[8:05:54] sBuon: classic old people
[8:06:07] kool_guy: AAAA
[8:06:07] Nightbot: AAAA
[8:06:07] Originnal: @Lilliphus thats nothing g6 realated
[8:06:17] LOLolsen: in rp are people arrested for self defense and then acquitted in court for acting in self defense?
[8:06:21] Lilliphus: @Originnal he had a custom ped
[8:06:24] Zorfianna: AAAA
[8:06:33] CBS_Kong: @DangersClose they were in between the shooter and brown? whats your point
[8:06:47] DangersClose: With the injuries on scene wasnt it only Benji and Raymond that had bullet wounds?
[8:06:48] VSDuck: @LOLolsen tbf that can happen IRL AAAA
[8:06:52] Smokay17: Does McNulty think Slack will be able to go to bed on time tonight?
[8:07:03] LOLolsen: @VSDuck thats why im asking!
[8:07:04] MrHyde81: @LOLolsen They are rewriting the "stand your ground" laws
[8:07:12] Konkwistador_1002: @Konkwistador_1002 i suppose, but basics like id, wounds, gsr should be given
[8:07:14] VSDuck: @LOLolsen OHHH AAAA
[8:07:46] JuicyGamer5: hey custard I love your r6 charm
[8:07:50] DangersClose: @CBS_Kong In Harry's statement he is saying Benji, Raymond and Jean paul all in the same car. But then injuries on scene was only Benji and raymond shot. Makes no sense
[8:07:55] LOLolsen: @VSDuck yeah as far as i know self defense is a court thing not an on scene thing

[8:39:15] DangersClose: Re-watched Ray's direct statement to McNulty. Your first words in the questioning "Can you talk me through what transpired to get you up on orchardvale and shot down.". So this means McNulty knew the injuries.
[8:39:23] DangersClose: Ray's statement of what happened when talking to McNulty was "It was someone that didnt like me because they shouted FUCK YOU RAY, and then as i was getting shot at i got stabbed in the back"
