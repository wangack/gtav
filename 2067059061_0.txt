[0:25:40] Fugeki: I heard too much fruit is bad too for sugar and I like fruits
[0:25:45] f2pOH: Need to try lighter roasts of coffee, especially naturally processed beans
[0:26:07] ramen4u2day: Everything has to be balanced
[0:26:10] Tyriese: Getting some real nice hazelnut or macadamia flavored beans makes the coffee seem sweeter.
[0:26:12] f2pOH: Natural process > washed or honey processed beans IMO
[0:26:13] FiniteResources: there's a good oat milk creamer at whole foods that i think makes for a good cup
[0:26:13] bluhead1: I think pure maple syrup is fine. high fructose corn syrup is bad

[0:26:17] captreees: breakdown fast
[0:26:19] AdrianShoey: its also includes fiber

[0:26:35] LiquidMemoria: eating too much of anything is bad @Harry
[0:27:14] NivaSknor: Still, better to eat fruit that contains more fiber, or just add something like oats
[0:27:35] Fugeki: for sure though I feel in the US food is so processed compared to EU / SA
[0:27:37] natediggitty__: I ate Taco Bell now feel like shit
[0:27:40] bluhead1: Berries and cherries are the best
[0:27:41] Tyriese: Sugar and fiber together. fruit is a problem when you remove the fiber ie juice, then its just sugar.
[0:27:43] ramen4u2day: you should eat a variety of fruit, if you eat a lot of 1 specific one that's when things get a bit iffy but it's still far better than sugary candies and pastries
[0:27:46] ForgetMidnight: aloo chat and harry harrWave hope you had a good sunday
[0:27:57] bigbobs37: the new taco bell menu is fire
[0:28:01] lunate87: skim milk?

[0:28:48] bigbobs37: i slam a gallon of whole fat after  benders
[0:29:00] bluhead1: oat milk is the biggest scam in food
[0:29:02] natediggitty__: cocaine blenders
[0:29:02] ElleNnyla: add a little cinnamon to sweeten it
[0:29:03] aramps: agreed
[0:29:05] jungbenzo: oat milk and nut milks are full of vegetable oil

[0:29:24] ForgetMidnight: it's not that hard to make your own Shruge thats what I do
[0:29:24] bluhead1: oats are a scam
[0:29:24] mrdumpling420: It's like eating Beyond meat lol or fat burgers. Haha like 80 ingredients
[0:29:26] togusaa: Oatmilk also expires SUPER fast
[0:29:32] Tyriese: and those ones definitely gonna taste like shite if theyre actually healthy
[0:29:37] quadity2: All I drink all day is black coffee and water. It was hard at first, but used to it now.
[0:29:42] umathys: @bluhead1 ???
[0:29:45] TropicalToucan: I dont like calling anything that isnt coming from an animal milk. That shit is Nut juice or oat sweat.
[0:29:46] aanzio: emulsifers
[0:29:47] Bicmillan: Those 3 ingredient ones taste like ass
[0:29:57] Bicmillan: The ones with a bunch of oils and gums taste the best

[0:30:28] wilson060: honey good as hell
[0:30:30] aramps: vietemese coffee is dangerous
[0:30:31] lunate87: addiction KEKW
[0:30:36] plutr0nium: Yeah, I drink black coffee, then someone left a bottle of syrup at my house. I got hooked.

[3:55:53] Thatgooey: did they have a run scuff?
[3:56:29] Sword_Scream: @blouse_92 Multiple reasons:  1. The money is good. 4.4kish for an hours work, and it's clean. 2. He can do this while waiting on a cook to finish. 3. A clean front is ALWAYS nice.

[3:58:24] AnomanderRake__: ?
[3:58:39] Sword_Scream: @blouse_92 Teddy, but has also taught it to Martin. The "problem" with the weed game is that it takes a lot of time being up there and it's unpredictable, you need the boys to push, or else it's just a job with no real output.
[3:59:00] mechabananas: @Aumilly Youll always be the best in my heart cloakr1Heart

[3:59:59] AnomanderRake__: chefsKiss
[4:01:24] AnomanderRake__: Harry what do you to keep in shape. Gym? Long walks?
[4:01:24] mechabananas: @Sword_Scream I always read it as Awh-Milly
[4:01:31] oldwrldblues: uhnWiggle2

[4:05:09] Poison_ttv_: tony drives it like its stolen
[4:06:17] mechabananas: @Aumilly Bingo Bango WICKED
[4:06:18] Sword_Scream: @Poison_ttv_ Tony drives everything like it's stolen and he's in a chase. It's a permanent state of being for him
[4:06:31] Roz721: Is harry doing grime?
[4:06:38] plutr0nium: Imagine packer/pounder races.
[4:07:00] the_falleno: the_falleno subscribed at Tier 1. 
[4:07:08] FaramirRat: We are al being chased non-stop by father time, Tony tries to out-run him but he can't, no one can.

[4:07:58] Sword_Scream: Grime is ideal for sewer goblin subspeccing. It's a clean front, it takes enough time where a cook can be going, and it's actually good money for the time spent
[4:09:32] Fuhtzzz: @Sword_Scream "sewer goblin subspeccing" LOL KEKW
[4:10:13] Aledz_: I think Harry has been locking in some hours on the Truck Driving Simulator, these lines are clean ratgeEZ
[4:10:47] FaramirRat: Los Santos Truck simulator
[4:11:46] Sword_Scream: @Fuhtzzz I mean, it makes sense, no? :D
[4:12:55] walter33438: When did you start doing grime
[4:12:58] FaramirRat: Always wanted to be a truck driver for a time, travel the country, but they do hair follicle tests and I smoke cannabis, you can get off-duty and get drunk as a skunk, but one hit of cannabis and you can't be a truck driver.
[4:13:00] FaramirRat: world is fucked
[4:13:03] Tiilde: Look at Harry Griming
[4:13:32] mechabananas: drug testing
[4:13:32] Tiilde: I cant wait for the day Harry joins Tony on a run... and it scuffs upon scuff KEKW
[4:13:34] FaramirRat: They take a hair follicle and drug test
[4:13:34] SlimR11: they take a piece of hair
[4:13:35] Sword_Scream: They can trace drugs in your hair follicles.
[4:13:49] Aumilly: Durg testing where they can see months of your drug use
[4:13:52] Poison_ttv_: like a tree ring for when you smoke weed lol
[4:14:02] jefe131: jefe131 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 2 month streak! what's up harry good vibes
[4:14:06] Edxn: yeah and its stays in the hair for up to a year right?
[4:14:07] Thatgooey: hair follicle test will show positive like 6 months out man, you really gotta commit and wait if you have something that does that
[4:14:07] FaramirRat: Cannabis literally stays in your hair forever, you would have to shave all your current hair off and regrow it never smoking.
[4:14:08] bigxfisch: shave it all
[4:14:16] mechabananas: @Poison_ttv_ honestly the best description on hair testing
[4:14:22] togusaa: shaving bald should get around that right?
[4:14:39] FaramirRat: You cant dodge it they will make you give them a pubic hair or arm hair
[4:14:39] bigxfisch: @togusaa eyebrows and all
[4:14:40] bobbls: @togusaa could just test any other hair
[4:14:48] Sword_Scream: Yeah, hair follicle test is why a lot of peopl in branches that have a high amount of drug users are bald. Also why a big amount of drug users are bald/shaved their head.
[4:14:56] Sword_Scream: people*
[4:14:59] plutr0nium: Isn't that why Britney Spears shaved her head back when she was wilding out?
[4:14:59] Tiilde: @FaramirRat  yeah you can.. shave it all >_>
[4:15:05] mechabananas: @togusaa Need to get a brazilian then too
[4:15:17] FaramirRat: @Tiilde lol most truck places will be suspicious of that and not let you pass
[4:15:24] SlimR11: just go full naked mole rat
[4:15:33] bigxfisch: full shave, clean slate lmao
[4:15:34] bobbls: @Tiilde yeah have fun explaining the lack of eyebrows and arm and leg hair lmao
[4:15:36] tenthBRETT_: develop alopecia
[4:16:00] crumptwo: show up to CDL test fully lasered and smooth as a newt
[4:16:01] Tiilde: not really >_>
[4:16:13] sir_jawn: Nothing glamorous about it
[4:16:16] PurpleAndGold: stressful job, insane hours, no thanks
[4:16:20] SpilledNuts: sounds like being a streamer
[4:16:22] plutr0nium: The lot lizards tho
[4:16:23] Tasty_Pixel: So a streamer
[4:16:23] Sword_Scream: Truck driving isn't the peak, but for a lot of people it's about the traveling, and they enjoy the lifestyle
[4:16:23] The_BigDusty: its like 20 hour drives fuck that
[4:16:24] Brotah: but the lot lizards
[4:16:26] bobbls: it pays decent and you don't really need a lot of training, fair enough
[4:16:26] IvyOlive: hard to shower
[4:16:29] mechabananas: @SpilledNuts OMEGALUL
[4:16:29] Aledz_: truck driving are long ass hours on the road for weeks at a time, your truck is your home
[4:16:29] Thatgooey: well courts can order hair follicle tests for legal preceedings here in the states for certain circumstances, regardless of your employment
[4:16:30] jootv: same could be the same about streamers
[4:16:30] bigxfisch: takes a special type of person that’s for sure
[4:16:31] Edxn: deal with shitty drivers and road rage
[4:16:33] FaramirRat: See the body holds onto chemicals from cannabis forever to use in the endocanoboid system, all other drugs you can take, including alcohol your body will flush out of your system as fast as friggin possible, yet cannabis is illegal.
[4:16:35] togusaa: yeah 20 hr drives, not happenin
[4:16:41] TheGardens12: its not 20hr
[4:16:43] Sword_Scream: Some people also just... REALLY likes to drive
[4:16:47] TheGardens12: 12hr by law
[4:16:47] Fuhtzzz: as if the long hours werent enough, it'd be so hard to drive something that big everywhere lol
[4:16:53] RabCrangoon: blood clots Aware
[4:16:55] Brotah: Kappa
[4:17:00] yellowtristan: I’ve known a few, constantly driving struggling to stay awake since the sleep is shit, away from family for sometimes months at a time
[4:17:01] IvyOlive: streamers still have bathrooms and running water
[4:17:02] TheGardens12: truck drivers can have pc in their cabins
[4:17:10] mechabananas: Not a truck driver but Ive got the same Diet Aware
[4:17:11] PurpleAndGold: some streamers work like 4 hours a day and are chillin lol
[4:17:20] TheGardens12: they mostly shower at truck stops
[4:17:23] cary7: Heard truck stop showers are a big thing
[4:17:24] Brotah: Most long distance truck drivers I know are on meth
[4:17:31] togusaa: people that stream dont have to worry about being cut off on the highway by morons
[4:17:36] yellowtristan: truck stops have nice showers with infinite hot water most of the time
[4:17:37] Tiilde: @bobbls  Religious reasons. Buddhist shave almost everything if they become a monk for a bit or a day (funerals)
[4:17:45] geo_logic_: truck stop showers are probably better than gym showers tbh. Theyre cleaned after every person
[4:18:02] BiscuitKnight: cali has too many laws going against truck driver
[4:18:06] yellowtristan: and you have the shower for as long as you pay for
[4:18:23] yellowtristan: so there is that I guess

[5:45:38] Sword_Scream: The best you can do aside from subbing is twitch turbo. It doesn't give you ads, but the streamer gets the highest ad revenue possible per impression. Also it counts as you getting ads, even if you are subbed.
[5:45:38] Rool_Gonzalez: Prime subs are gonna loose 40% of their value in like July?
[5:45:45] Iron_Wolf_Sicario: turbo gang

[5:46:21] Demeir: More subs helps get sponsor ads too I'm sure.  Unless they only care about average viewer count, not sure.
[5:46:24] AnaklusmosDaze: nodd
[5:46:31] m0hx000: So Turbo is better then?
[5:46:34] Sword_Scream: @Harry Twitch Turbo. That's the real trick. You get max ad rev per view, and the viewer doesn't have to deal with ads.

[5:49:43] Sword_Scream: Twitch Turbo, the best 10$ a month you can spend on twitch.
[5:49:45] turbodyrock: Juice it daddy
[5:49:48] hiicks_: I think for people who watch NoPixel and like to see PoV's of every side of scenes then twitch turbo is a must, started using it 3 months ago it's so good

[5:50:41] Scorpio_o7: I've been an RP viewer since early 2.0 and twitch turbo is definitely the way to go if you watch a lot of RP

[6:33:22] Sword_Scream: @Rool_Gonzalez Back then it was a lot easier, and less strict. From what I understand now it's kinda a writing assignment. The video interview, back when it was an option, was good from what I heard.

[6:35:04] Sword_Scream: @Rool_Gonzalez Yeah, that used to be a good way, but not so much anymore. The donator/supporter entrance is the best way now. but it is a bit pricey
[6:35:15] Rool_Gonzalez: Yep
[6:35:17] Zechss_: @Demeir for me wasss like 3 weeks if i remember before i heard back, but thats what 4 years ago.. so could be wrong

[6:45:26] megamanyvr: @deagleeye anything above 80 proof is technically over proofed
[6:45:29] NicolaFred: I mean more refined alcohol so Harry starts delivering cocktails in Vinewood instead of moonshine to shacks
[6:46:21] Rool_Gonzalez: @megamanyvr set the spirit on fire and it goes till it's 80 proof and flame dies on its own
[6:46:22] DEagleEye: @megamanyvr yea i dont know of any legal alcohols above 80% but im not an expert on the matter, highest i know is absinthe is 78%
[6:46:58] Rool_Gonzalez: Stroh is 80%
[6:47:00] DEagleEye: i have some stuff thats supposedly 90% but ive never tested it
[6:47:20] DEagleEye: i know drinking it straight is a mistake though LUL

[6:49:01] DEagleEye: ive never heard of everclear what type of alcohol is that?
