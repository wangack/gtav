[9:11:58] Ichigolo: thats exactly how k feels
[9:12:11] Goldennuggets79: @shotz it‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt like CG unfortunately
[9:12:12] iTzMeegra: so did K
[9:12:14] sleeplesswolf94: lets be honest the PD isnt actually the smartest, differentiating between MrK/Ramee and Popular ran by Vinny is to pretty hard for squad that has a combined brain cell count of 3
[9:12:20] 5nthony: it feels like you have to go through extra obstacles
[9:12:29] azhobbit_: but Mr K has gone into demon mode until he is shot by J and Mary
[9:12:30] feedtheboss: thats it and Mr K is doing his own thing
