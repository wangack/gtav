[6:45:03] Thrath: @Conasht Yeah having more people trying is just better

[6:45:26] Meyerable: kivaDed
[6:45:46] LolmanScott: like 1k per car is still pretty good at a 10% success rate

[6:47:32] tadjh_: EZ one shot the hack
[6:47:40] zeman94: Does she have friends in another group that would want to chop?
[6:47:44] CautiousDani: is practicing with a different group off the table kivaWhat
[6:48:20] LolmanScott: ooh is the issue that ant feels like she can't fail infront of them?
[6:48:23] uitzui: so who could she ask, ed?
[6:48:31] jdeflume: DinkDonk Shang need to chop, pls buy tool
[6:48:33] Thrath: I thought Glory offered?
[6:48:46] Conasht: maybe call Barry?
[6:48:47] sindent: Barry might be a good person to do it with as well?
[6:48:54] Madam_Orange: she could find someone to go halfsies on a tool that both need practice runs
[6:49:20] VaiNeko: ithought thats what pilbis offered but maybe im wrong
[6:50:01] CautiousDani: Ye that’s kinda the word pride
[6:50:56] Random_Slacker: maybe shang has one? and could goof around with him
[6:53:00] minimalsnow: kivaMusic
[6:53:03] Conasht: so who is Andi actually comfortable with to try the hacks?
[6:53:35] Thrath: What about Rod? kivaSus
[6:53:47] Random_Slacker: yeah was only really suggesting shang since he was already reaching out, sorry :)
[6:55:11] CautiousDani: I’d say trying with the survival thing won’t hurt anything at all kivaFlower
[6:55:27] wizardiis: kivaLove
[6:55:29] Random_Slacker: would it be worth reaching out to buddha? he seemed very supportive last time around
[6:55:42] uitzui: probably because what always happens happened, Ant sacrifices herself for everyone and when the one thing she wants for herself comes up she gets ignored
