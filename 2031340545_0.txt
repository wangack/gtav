[0:45:41] Ender_Panda: Yeah probably that
[0:45:42] STLHawks: depending on how the signage parses the HTML, it may be buggy on multiple font declarations.
[0:45:55] TheSvess: try adding a break tab at the start
[0:45:56] original_khawk: put a <br> in front that will make first line a empty line
[0:46:05] WitchenInTheKitchen: what if it’s the emoji?

[0:47:01] iCandyNicoP: dont put the the size in twice. only leave the first
[0:47:02] Pog_Hammarskjold: Hmmm
[0:47:03] sauslol: So the scene might "own" everything before the first break. so You might be able to like put a blank space before then break
[0:47:11] Aitch44: Try it with just the red text second line and see if the size stays
[0:47:20] CaitiCapybara: Can you please correct the spelling in Trespassing :)

[0:50:23] SLHHunter: what are we trying to achieve? The sign looks good imo
[0:50:23] sauslol: It has to be because of how the scene editors own the first part of the message.
