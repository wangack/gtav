[4:53:32] trungthiendo: yeah but no benefits atm so no point to doing it now
[4:53:42] Skillah10s: ofcourse
[4:53:47] renjie_fc: yess move it to sandy 100%
[4:54:20] Supernaw: its no zaza rep its turf rep
[4:54:21] akazplays: cooked
[4:54:24] Dnas3: Nah makes sense to move it off cypress but not to sandy to test it imo
[4:54:27] cardztide: this is a prolly a question for the weed folks thatve done it 12hr a day for 2 months lol
[4:54:35] chechlto1: still a density factor
[4:54:37] VeteranClacky: it could move with it 33% of sales in cypass over to sandy. imagine them dropping 25% LUL

[4:55:38] BealethNL: @Ray__C I am hopping from an hour in the past where a chatter made the comment "way to set an example" about your nails. You are actually setting an example in the positive sense of it. You show younger viewers that its ok to pain their nails if they want to, if they like it. Its something that has bene accepted in the emo and metal scene for over 20 years. Keep it up and dont let those negative comments bother you.

[7:51:50] djgagann: Benji is too much
[7:51:53] xXxEV0xXx: Benji would know.. hes has the worse case of that.
[7:51:54] nyjulio: To much talking here.
[7:51:55] xXxEV0xXx: :p
[7:51:59] e1k4bong: Kj or Sly are the obvious choices.
[7:52:08] g_host_28: @akazplays True but can you board them after no shot.  Relationships need trust
[7:52:15] yoryke: I think he actualy looks forward to not being in charge when he is with the company
[7:52:15] rstineffect: Berric for board member
[7:52:18] JellyCraven: I love how you said "just say 1 person" cus you knew Benji couldn't say 1 person, and he just said everybody icant
[7:52:20] KwayyXX: another jp
[7:52:21] djgagann: I agree with KJ or sly. Both good leaders
[7:52:22] e1k4bong: They are both hilarious, hella productive, and already put the company 1st
[7:52:24] KwayyXX: Kappa
[7:52:31] akazplays: @g_host_28 oh ya not for board, but alliance for sure

[7:53:17] Skillah10s: Jack for sure
[7:53:22] e1k4bong: That doesnt mean shit.
[7:53:33] xXxEV0xXx: @djgagann only reason that might not work, is cause KJ follows benji and sly follows Ott.. not sure if it would work them being equals.
[7:53:33] Rezymedia: 8 hour stream pluss what you did last nihgt mans puttin hourssss in
[7:53:33] futuregoat123: why does that matter
[7:53:45] ItsTheRealChi: @sad01 they should set him up to loose his g6. His arc this season is more chaotic. Hes already killed someone. I think he could become a decent wildcard.
