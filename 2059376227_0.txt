And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you."

[6:16:32] Ten_Ju: Esfand's issue is that he doesn't stay tertiary, he tries to go parallel when he's explicitly asked to go tertiary. Which is how he end up so behind.
