[0:47:20] Squawq: my bad
[0:47:21] romfi: bazzAwkies SteerR
[0:47:21] pepe_silvia_as: @lordofspin true, but france is one of the rare ones, most countries don't even have the authority to use nuclear power, germany tried solar, when they barely have sun, and they depend on natural gas, like most countries
[0:47:47] lodropna: no
[0:47:48] Lunar_Delta: Because youre bad at math
[0:47:50] sao_mito: Nope
[0:47:56] pepe_silvia_as: AAAA
[0:48:03] markisue: Poor dundee

[0:48:18] TheAngrierAvocado: strimmer math
[0:48:18] Thejutsanator: im tempted to do the dundee aproch to gambleing
[0:48:22] j0rilla: You have the IQ of a turtle and wonder why??
[0:48:27] Lunar_Delta: Chat, what did he expect to hit? I wasnt here for that
[0:48:35] lordofspin: @pepe_silvia_as germany was dumb to shut down their nuclear plants because of all the fear mongering and most western countries can do nuclear. Truth is nuclear is right now better than most renewable energy sources and
[0:48:39] shadowvale81: @lunar_delta 21
[0:48:40] pepe_silvia_as: @Lunar_Delta bet 21 on a roulette table
[0:48:41] Andyglobehead: baby behavior
[0:48:44] davidayotte: traumzWave chat
[0:48:49] Kinson1: @Drekal95 Sad, because Molten Salt reactors are awesome.

[0:49:35] GomerisS: like a bit smarter than dundee
[0:49:35] Kryptic_Light: Your just dumb
[0:49:35] shacklyn: speaking of turtles, strimmer has one poking its head out right now
[0:49:38] Lunar_Delta: They arent paying taxes so...
[0:49:38] pepe_silvia_as: @lordofspin you also need to account for all the nuclear waste from power plants, that most nations just dumb in in tanks
[0:49:46] DjRetroPhase: Cop was still there
[0:49:46] davidayotte: good point whippy
[0:49:47] pepe_silvia_as: dump*
[0:49:47] DarkenedWorld: hes smart cos he made u move him
[0:49:50] DjRetroPhase: AAAA
[0:49:52] j0rilla: Lmao I guess he did not see what I said
[0:49:54] Andyglobehead: size doesn’t matter
[0:50:03] romfi: Hmmge
[0:50:04] DarkenedWorld: no as the dog isnt a person
[0:50:06] shadowvale81: They just move and eat for the most of there life
[0:50:14] MegaKarp101: size doesn't matter its the wrinkles that count for brains
[0:50:15] Jpoc2012: another vod?
[0:50:21] shacklyn: the owner of the dog would pay the taxes
[0:50:28] Drekal95: @pepe_silvia_as The waste from nuclear is infinitely smaller than other energy though
[0:50:32] pepe_silvia_as: HUHH
[0:50:33] Thejutsanator: the owner would have to pay taxes
[0:50:34] lordofspin: @pepe_silvia_as the nuclear waste hype is way too over hyped by fear mongerers and there are good wasy to deal with it now. One coal plant produces more danger in a short period of time than a nuclear plant would in an entire lifetime of its run
[0:50:34] maxfinan101: yes because the government wants money
[0:50:35] Squawq: legal person yes
[0:50:37] shadowvale81: If he's working then yes
[0:50:38] Lunar_Delta: Then hed be like Ted, from the movie Ted.
[0:50:41] DarkenedWorld: he would be experimented on as he would have no rights
[0:50:43] davidayotte: wax and the tax
[0:50:44] cubbie2o2o: If a dog was on a commercial and the dog made money, it would be the owners money
[0:50:50] Andyglobehead: the dogs isn’t a person and won’t have rights
[0:50:54] Maffinz: theres no law atm with that
[0:50:58] Maffinz: exploit it
[0:51:01] shadowvale81: Yo dawg, time to give up the treats
[0:51:01] Blackhawk_TB21: "Yo dog...welcome to the race"
[0:51:03] REcell: OhMyDog
[0:51:10] Funderbolt: Did Air Bud have to pay taxes?
[0:51:15] Andyglobehead: the owner would still act like a parent or gaurdian
[0:51:22] pepe_silvia_as: @lordofspin not saying nuclear is worse than coal AAAA coal is literally the worst, and that is what most countries use, thus the argument against electric cars
[0:51:27] shacklyn: they are paid in room and board
[0:51:39] maxfinan101: they would eat money
[0:51:53] Astralduelist: teach a dog to pay taxes EZ
[0:51:57] DieMrCupCake: KEKW
[0:51:57] Blackhawk_TB21: because dogs don't have a tax ID...now if you can get a tax ID for a dog then.......TAX SHELTER!!!!
[0:51:59] pepe_silvia_as: @lordofspin this conversation is way too sophistaced for a whippy chat
[0:52:05] romfi: Hmmge  󠀀
[0:52:06] Maffinz: teach a dog to be dundee
[0:52:11] sket_tchy: I like the logic
[0:52:12] pepe_silvia_as: sophisticated*
[0:52:13] Valroz: How are they going to play poker if we don't pay them for their work
[0:52:18] romfi: catHmm
[0:52:30] scido: monkaS
[0:52:32] tyrranicus222: We give money to humans and we dont know how to handle it
[0:52:33] Andyglobehead: chats too smart for whippy
[0:52:36] jjanieee: my moms friend’s dog was on ripleys believe it or not because he could literally count. he counted to 5 on my 5th birthday
[0:52:37] romfi: monkaS
[0:52:39] sidusmoon: why me dog sad
[0:52:44] maxfinan101: that dog now has anxiety issues
[0:52:49] MegaKarp101: Bunny started asking why am I a dog? it scared me
[0:52:52] pepe_silvia_as: @lordofspin we are going on about the pros and cons of nuclear power while streamer is talking about teaching dogs to talk
[0:52:53] shacklyn: the lesson here is that ignorance is bliss
[0:52:53] maxfinan101: and has to take meds
[0:52:59] TheAughlnal: @pepe_silvia_as I don't see how that is an argument against electric cars, since electric cars can run just as well on clean energy. it's just an argument against coal power plants.
[0:53:09] jjanieee: what about bunny on Instagram is who ziggy is talking about :)
[0:53:26] dr3ddlaw: self awareness
[0:53:27] shadowvale81: For all we know dogs are smarter and communicate like " hey man I think something's wrong with my human they just keep saying "who's a good dog"
[0:53:40] pepe_silvia_as: @TheAughlnal as long as nations are mainly using coal and natural gas to make electricity, the argument that electric cars are "carbon neutral" is bullshit
[0:53:48] dono_saur: Bunny is so interesting like she would look into the mirror and ask why it was a dog and it's human was human
[0:53:55] DieMrCupCake: dont worry chat Fusion is coming soon whipCopium
[0:54:13] lordofspin: @pepe_silvia_as lol. true but to be fair strimmer man did start the whole convo but yeah..probably best to retire this convo :P
[0:54:26] shadowvale81: The real wues4 would be would Ziggy suck the snake bite
[0:54:30] pepe_silvia_as: @lordofspin yup AAAA
[0:54:32] shadowvale81: Question
[0:54:40] romfi: CuteDog
[0:54:47] gmsgaming_: Saddies Why Dog
[0:54:47] Kinson1: @Whippy Crazy self-awareness
[0:54:54] romfi: Saddies
[0:55:01] dono_saur: whipSuffer why dog
[0:55:04] jjanieee: bunny also has chronic stomach issues and let her mom know when she needed medicine

[0:55:27] EvlCoyot: Always self aware, just no way to communicate with us.
[0:55:30] dono_saur: Bunny Dog is on like anti depressants I think
[0:55:31] Kinson1: Why Whippy watcher? .. KEYS!
[0:55:33] KingLiven27: coincidence
[0:55:37] maxfinan101: the dog also takes anxiety meds now
[0:55:42] pepe_silvia_as: damn this car is slow
[0:56:04] slyoperator: Depresso
[0:56:04] Squawq: language is a one of the core things you need for self awareness so kinda
[0:56:05] Oscar_Herodo: maybe its was questioning why it wasnt a bunny
[0:56:14] Hydruxee: just give him friends Sadge
[0:56:19] GomerisS: Why Bunny alcoholic now
[0:56:23] Lunar_Delta: BORK BORK BORK: "Are you a dog?" "I am a dog" " IM A DOG TOO!" bork bork bork
[0:56:29] shadowvale81: Dogs like " why can I SNIFF that butt but not a humans"
[0:56:33] BoostedJzx: Your live hella early what the hell

[0:56:47] dontspeak98: I believe they can yes
[0:56:48] Andyglobehead: different brain chemistry
[0:56:52] shacklyn: i'm sure it's already been tested
[0:56:54] Lunar_Delta: addiction isnt caused by one consumption
[0:56:54] pepe_silvia_as: @BoostedJzx he starts stream almost an hour ago since 4.0
[0:56:56] jjanieee: no alcohol is very poisonous to dogs
[0:56:57] dr3ddlaw: probablt wont continue drinking it after feeling shit
[0:56:59] shacklyn: after all, russia sent a dog into space
[0:57:01] KingLiven27: Because we're mammals
[0:57:01] Squawq: with other drugs maybe but idk with that
[0:57:06] GomerisS: apparently dogs can get addicted to booze
[0:57:07] shadowvale81: Evolution, we live in the land so we have no need of them
[0:57:10] maxfinan101: we are fish
[0:57:14] Axaion: no thanks, water aint that clean anymore

[0:57:25] pepe_silvia_as: we want gills! when do we want em? NOW
[0:57:55] ShredSqk: gills or wings?
[0:58:01] BasherPUBG: sandy
[0:58:01] Axaion: monkaHmm what if ziggy suddenly becomes the best driver in the city because hes no longer a ranger
[0:58:02] JaxBak: Sandy

[0:58:15] cubbie2o2o: spend more time in the water and over 10,000's year you'll form gills
[0:58:22] maxfinan101: i knew it
[0:58:28] TheMoS22: @maxfinan101 New Zealand is better anyway KEKW
[0:58:31] Valroz: sandy doesn't have gills which is why she lives in a dome
[0:58:32] wacjac: Its all a simulation

[5:00:00] lowvr6tj: you would make more money and rep faster doing sani runs than that
[5:00:03] SirJezDog: volume, like costco
[5:00:06] lowvr6tj: LUL
[5:00:28] Ethetz: If Dundee gets punched 200 times on the corner he would make 10k
[5:00:33] General_jainobi: 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️  ire than 5%
[5:00:38] gowofwarfan: i love how dundee make crazy money scams sound so smart
[5:01:10] Ushety: @gowofwarfan how is it a scam? it money for providing a service
[5:01:14] OpyPhupapy: Question how often you need to refill the machines to clean 10k for that 500 dollar.
[5:01:17] rellkilledyou: Profit margin wouldn’t be that much unless you have alot of business
[5:01:17] DeadendShoe: Dundee could dress sexy and set up a car wash and bring back the wax
[5:01:22] IamthaKingslayer: unfortunately for dundee it takes money to make money and dee has no money lol
[5:01:25] Usahi_Light: @gowofwarfan its a scam because hes scamming himself OMEGAKEKW
[5:01:44] Ethetz: 200 punches to the face = 10k ez money
[5:01:45] rellkilledyou: 10% would be better if you need me imo

[5:03:15] MikeOnSky: not on long run, you need to be fast, because you will be left again behind
[5:03:16] m0rtified: on a scale of 1-10, it is -10000
[5:03:16] Usahi_Light: i dont watch any other crims but im gonna assume anyone pushing that vast amount of money to evne warrant washing alread has a machine because they have money
[5:03:18] lowvr6tj: make more money as a civ
[5:03:21] alienslx: its a good idea but Dundee doesn't even have 1 washing machine yet
[5:03:22] OpyPhupapy: 3 of 10.   I'm sure it takes long time and many refilling.
[5:03:23] General_jainobi: strimmer 7.5 then
[5:03:23] IamthaKingslayer: i think dundee would be best to actually go to the house and get tess to show him how the washers work first so he knows how they work lol
[5:03:26] KillSwitchAUk: Its reminding me of Dundees material deal from 3.0
[5:03:30] Ethetz: run out of machines to wash xD
[5:03:31] Lunar_Delta: youre doing the same thing as Vinny did to Mosleys. Youre pushing all the money out of the business
[5:03:31] markisue: the math doesnt add up
[5:03:32] AceMcgee420: Tom doesn't agree
[5:03:38] Valroz: do some math real quick how many notes do you have to buy to pay for 1 machine
[5:03:42] soupreme7: Best compromise: 6.9%
[5:03:47] pwnageclapz: the math aint mathing strimmer NODDERS
[5:03:50] KaylaAnneKay13: 10 to start with potential to go down to 5 for good customers
[5:03:59] General_jainobi: everyone like 6.9 @soupreme7
[5:04:03] AlbatrossBlue: @iamthakingslayer ahh...ye true lol
[5:04:06] RAYoLight67: just pay them 5% to do their laundry for them that would be the Dundee stupid way
[5:04:22] sao_mito: Just stick to the weed and you'll eventually start making that money. Plus you could do Mosleys in-between each weed run
[5:04:42] OpyPhupapy: 10% if they ask cash ASAP, 5% if they are ok waiting payment after cleaning.

[5:07:21] General_jainobi: if your thinking 5% and everyone else is 25% why cant you do 10% think a out it @whippy
[5:07:31] wafflelovertreemillion: @Usahi_Light thats what i wanna know
[5:07:45] Usahi_Light: i think its worth finding out in RP
[5:08:02] IamthaKingslayer: 40 washing machines all running at once can i put stocks in the electric company there gonna love dundee haha
[5:08:10] shadowvale81: The problem with doing it at 10% that leaves a window form someone else to charge less
