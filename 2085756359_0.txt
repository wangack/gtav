[1:08:37] crookz_n_castlez: Way outta left field LUL
[1:08:42] corpsesr: LOL i love it
[1:08:45] KKumare: @Vara_Majima hmm, the only good car crims can lockpick is the lampadaddy and this car is like a cop magnet :D most of the others are good at turns but barly make 100mph+
[1:08:46] AnusReaktorMan: @deansocool ask Watson for vstr Prayge

[1:09:04] Zunnun: You ever driven a gtr its Japanese tho that's good
[1:09:24] E_Turn_UL: police copters go what 150?

[1:09:36] RoverNamedRed: 😂😂😭😭☠️
[1:09:39] YoshiTheDeeno: @sleepypandarl it'll keep up for a long time with out turbo it hits 180 easy with turbo 190+
[1:09:58] TheNotoriousKEV: he has a report
[1:10:00] AnusReaktorMan: It's report
[1:10:04] intoxicologistt: he does
[1:10:05] Vara_Majima: @KKumare Ahh thats good to know, i just see PD getting smoked constantly so thats the only side i have to go on, but its good to know that its not completely 1 sided
[1:10:16] SleepyPandaRL: @YoshiTheDeeno well no dean drove it yesterday and it hit max 136 without turbo
[1:10:25] RoverNamedRed: i can't. The cops get American cars sell the criminals Japanese cars so that the merica cops can catch the criminals. 😂😭😂☠️
[1:10:33] shaddydaddyo: LENNY WILL BE ARRESTING
[1:10:36] Fossabot: If your enjoying the stream smash the DAMN follow button! I mean shit its just a click away... Might see your name on screen ;)
[1:10:38] SleepyPandaRL: with 99 turbo it hits 180 max

[1:11:05] Bigeyez: PPO promotion today? @Deansocool
[1:11:14] SleepyPandaRL: cause he has 99 in it prob\

[1:11:36] SleepyPandaRL: it went max 136
[1:11:39] YoshiTheDeeno: I think they changed the vehicals like tweaked them slacks said this week they are changing stuff
[1:11:40] ilostuniverse: Was a whole water slide
[1:11:40] SimpOnMyShrimp: AYAYA
[1:11:43] TheMentalMadman: who tf is the Uwu ahh dispatch voice
[1:11:52] intoxicologistt: @TheMentalMadman heidi
[1:11:55] m4l1kkk: Less competition
[1:11:58] Jethrq: @Kayklip not even a leap more like a whole mountain trail
[1:12:02] KKumare: @Vara_Majima yh, i watch pd and crims, i feel like balancing it, would be less fun, its a question of tactics. like cops outnumber and are allowed to pit. got spikes etc. they just need to anticipate better, using paralells and they should get crims more often. RP wise i still believe crims should get away, if they dont fck up themselves. preparing those swaps can be time consuming too.
[1:12:02] Cosm1cChaos1: @bigcat52 wide but not widewood wide iykyk
[1:12:03] SteveAdeptus: I could see Denzel as Capt

[1:12:30] owlx7: Captain America o7
[1:12:30] Zealzeal: Denzel is like a slingshot he got pulled back so he can go far

[1:12:41] macneutron: King Is Destined To Lead SRU
[1:12:44] SleepyPandaRL: or mcnulty has a 99 on it idk
[1:12:49] Kayklip: WING
[1:12:53] YoshiTheDeeno: @sleepypandarl ya I'm not disagreeing but 8 do know slacks said they were tweaking it
[1:13:05] shurpness: @YoshiTheDeeno would make sense considering the restock is coming soon from what koil has said with new cars, etc coming
[1:13:08] Bigeyez: @KKumare yeah cops really should lose more chases then they win. if it was easier for cops then the whole thing wouldn't be as fun.
[1:13:11] BDG_Toa676: @macneutron ye just some a out him speaks leadership material
[1:13:17] BDG_Toa676: *about
[1:13:26] chmbrs: do you want me to open the clip queue for you? @Deansocool

[1:13:48] AnusReaktorMan: Open queue cuh
[1:13:51] chmbrs: yeah i can
[1:13:52] SleepyPandaRL: @YoshiTheDeeno true true corn tested taurus last stream put on some mods and tubro and it went 150
[1:13:54] KKumare: @Bigeyez exactly. also cars should be like high risk high reward. if you zoom, it should be hard to drive and stall quick. i also dont understand why PD got different repair kits than civs.
[1:13:57] owlx7: @BDG_Toa676 yea.. Sadge
[1:14:03] ilostuniverse: He read it deansoSad
[1:14:09] AnusReaktorMan: D:
[1:14:11] onlyicxrus: @Bigeyez If cops lose more chases then the crims should really keep their egos and annoyances in check and not go off the handle for no reason

[1:14:38] Vara_Majima: @KKumare I genuinely Agree with you, going from what ive seen honestly when you get someone like Dean or Snow on a chase, its so amazing to watch because the driving skill and anticipation is wild, i think they just need people to get somewhere close to that level of skill... i will be wholly honest watching Dean drive in chases is so fucking  cool

[1:54:09] mbecca98: Amazing water fight lol
[1:54:13] ilostuniverse: Yeah if we tell him to do something and he reads it he can't take action on it in rp so just vibe out
[1:54:23] youssefata18: @delinquentgains it's backseating which is against the rules of np if dean acts on it

[1:54:48] DanLGG: Dean saw everything we saw
[1:54:49] GinAntoniq: when is the next Donald Bush arriving?
[1:55:02] Xurkan: It's meta when it happens and he doesn't see it happening even if it was 1 inch in front of his face
[1:55:05] delinquentgains: his character saw it, so its not meta
[1:55:12] edgey56061: he defo dumped the gun in the water
[1:55:13] SpiritEX: Dentge my musket gunpowder got soaked it cant shoot

[1:56:13] delinquentgains: @youssefata18 im not the one telling him to do anything, im just someone saying its not meta
[1:56:15] SteveAdeptus: I wonder if he dropped a gun out in the water. Maybe that's why he swam.
[1:56:15] Oshelaka: Hey Chat, let's just sit back enjoy the stream and NOT meta ... :)

[3:25:37] Milo_lul: they got Lampadati factory in south side or what? omE2
[3:25:41] FilzG: they should limit the number of swaps crims can do, this is ridiculous
[3:26:01] j0k3rhub: @FilzG about 10 swaps its fine imo
[3:26:04] j0k3rhub: or 12
[3:26:05] Bigeyez: the limit is when cops finally shoot. but that basically ends the rp
[3:26:07] genesissukehiro: ok 5th of all shifts 1st of 1st shift i guess lol that was embarrassing for the cops :(
[3:26:12] DanLGG: Nah if you limit the number of swaps then they have to shoot

[3:27:01] FilzG: @Jethrq how is it good? cop cars get damaged, run out of fuel, and crims can just swap and get a new functional fully fueled car
[3:27:09] DanLGG: Depends on ur perspective. Shooting also ends a lot of rp
