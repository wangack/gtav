[1:46:30] wilson060: cop is dead dead OMEGALAUGHING
[1:46:31] Llcoolweas: is getting raided and having computers illegal?
[1:46:32] morulanvr: cousin makes no sense
[1:46:33] Nickknows: don't put all your eggs in one basket..
[1:46:34] danng: You are exposing him
[1:46:34] MADxBACKWARDS: cousin will totally get burned of his names on that house, people will search for that property cause they know you live there
[1:46:38] GyroBurps: cousin is right
[1:46:39] legendllllllll: just don’t have a bunch of stuff in the house
[1:46:41] taylor2electricboogaloo: That's kinda fine though right? As long as it's only a portion of the operation, then it's fine if it's raided
[1:46:41] MADxBACKWARDS: it’s burned
[1:46:41] giacobbogiacobbi: Octa getting caught? Be realistic lang
[1:46:41] idea_guy: Is Vito an option?
[1:46:47] tahoemac: has another edible
[1:46:50] lunorx6: yeah cousin is right
[1:46:52] phenomenal9: but they don’t assume it
[1:46:52] msdeell: can stop agreeing to a raid at any time with the police?
[1:46:53] legendllllllll: that’s a big risk!!
[1:46:57] searlesbarkleyk: It's too much money though
[1:47:02] sleepyeles: it's a huge liability
[1:47:02] officialqq: I thought buying a new house under cousins name was to not put the current in his? When did that change lol
[1:47:03] allknowing934: @idea_guy vito is pushing
[1:47:04] wafiy637: cloak yuno gigi clean name
[1:47:05] TheTrueLaw: but they would assume it only cause suddenly he owns the current house
[1:47:05] meego0o: -looking up house - see its cousin
[1:47:05] Niljapoli: i love how they aren't listening to the best clean guy in the city
[1:47:06] yaPPer808: he rarely got raided in 3.0 for heists because they either catch them with loot or not
[1:47:06] Zlagee: cousin is 100% right but whatever
[1:47:08] errrrrrL: wouldnt they assume it because of the transfer?
[1:47:09] nlzde: You can look up the house who owns it
[1:47:09] legendllllllll: it makes it wasier
[1:47:10] GreasySlothKing: cousins right imo
[1:47:10] shamma656: how about cloak or someone from the union
[1:47:12] legendllllllll: eaiser
[1:47:13] SadPeypey: everyone knows Cousin
[1:47:14] SomeCallMeSuperman: what...only one house to each "clean guy" don't have them all under one dude holy crap that would be risky
[1:47:14] Omega16bit: How will the make the leap
[1:47:18] Oisann: YAPPP
[1:47:19] BebopKhan: He is just the landlord
[1:47:21] watermelontoboggan: No point in having 2 properties if they are both under 1 person
[1:47:22] luckerooni: its about the daisy chain
[1:47:24] searlesbarkleyk: Him having 500k to himself sketchy too
[1:47:25] kiwiiyo: schroedingers cousin

[1:47:47] Aledz_: Cluegi
[1:47:47] avb5545: they're saying the act of selling to cousin is the link that implicates him
[1:47:49] wafiy637: you can check name
[1:47:50] oldwrldblues: Rookiano
[1:47:52] msdeell: you should speak to a lawyer - and look at records
[1:47:59] deathbykoalas: cant look for properties but theyll look up names like cousin
[1:47:59] wafiy637: yes you can
[1:48:02] Oni_mara: Dentge

[1:48:12] searlesbarkleyk: @msdeell excellent advice
[1:48:15] alotofrandomcrap: That house is burnt.
[1:48:28] msdeell: the o.g. house is burnt
[1:48:30] CinnbonSupaflav: Just use it as a weed runner drop off
[1:48:31] ktothec99: Why not just use it for stuff you are willing to lose in a potential raid?
[1:48:33] tommygunz_212: Leave computers in that house
[1:48:33] djerbis: you cant have all the baskets in one egg XD
[1:48:35] legendllllllll: forward operating spot
[1:48:37] stpotato9: too many eggs in one basket for cousin tho
[1:48:37] deathbykoalas: can keep the computers right?
[1:48:40] zRikyy96: but if they move the weed why can't harry keep it. you can have all the racks (pc) if they are legal
[1:48:43] source827: time for a second clean person
[1:48:44] meego0o: maybe its the raid house
[1:48:44] Omega16bit: Sell it to another person and then use that money to buy a new operations house.
[1:48:55] ramix3: poor yuno is waiting at the door XD
[1:48:57] GreasySlothKing: its a good bait house
[1:48:59] apepi: Kitty?
[1:49:04] msdeell: noo
[1:49:06] officialqq: Just make the secret closet entrance EZ No one will know
[1:49:07] VADICKUS007: LUL LUL LUL
[1:49:08] jaybobuk: sell it to lang and he uses for sanitation business
[1:49:13] caldavas: forsen?
[1:49:21] searlesbarkleyk: Dougie lol
[1:49:24] nlzde: putting all your eggs in one basket seems insane
[1:49:31] HKicker: Isn't it losing 2 houses instead of one
[1:49:32] Oisann: we line dancing
[1:49:34] taylor2electricboogaloo: If the cops see that operation in the south side, and then see it's under cousin's name, wouldn't they just raid all of his houses then>
[1:49:39] ElWeto: think they need another clean guy
[1:49:43] Messagge: truw putting all your eggs in one basket is never the move
[1:49:43] jstnbrt: Why are they worried about the company? Jp left
[1:49:44] stpotato9: it’s more about cops tho?
[1:49:45] searlesbarkleyk: Seems crazy putting all in one
[1:49:47] Omega16bit: all of the houses should be in different peoples names
[1:49:48] krimbo87: now he is invisible
[1:49:53] watermelontoboggan: If 1 house gets raided they both do lol
[1:49:54] GyroBurps: just use it for materials and sewer access
[1:50:00] mizf0o: u are making him visible
[1:50:04] am_kuro: cousin idea is right
[1:50:08] SadPeypey: yeah
[1:50:08] lunorx6: yeah
[1:50:08] legendllllllll: just sell the house honeslt
[1:50:09] Yetiee: Jose owns, Harry rents from Jose
[1:50:12] msdeell: it defeats the purpose of having a clean house
[1:50:15] lvlagg: yes but having one house that no one knows about, and having a house that everyone knows about
[1:50:19] darth_maz: put it in yuno's name lol shadow leader never gets raided lol
[1:50:23] slapch33ks: Dougie time.
[1:50:23] martymagoo78: but it’s separation, having a link to the really illegal house from the other house is prolly not good
[1:50:28] morulanvr: thats a problem
[1:50:28] mizf0o: just leave the house alone
[1:50:36] avb5545: find another clean person. Good luck. It was a miracle finding the one
[1:50:37] SkyHawk0404: Dougie isn't clean either he grows
[1:50:40] taylor2electricboogaloo: just leave it in one of the guys' name, if it gets raided who cares as long as it's not the core of the operation
[1:50:45] MelkorBauglir: Yuno or gege seem like a better option
[1:50:49] PuroCapi: Appy where is irma when we need her? PogO
[1:50:52] ulti_feeeeeeeed: I am surprised this convo emerged just now
[1:50:52] reagon_plays: there is some risk in every circumstances like cant built a full proof plan
[1:50:53] ktothec99: A bait house that's still dirty makes so much more sense
[1:50:53] searlesbarkleyk: Keep the PC racks there with one computer and transfer btc to other house
[1:50:53] awannii: it doesnt even need to be a clean person just not the grower xdd
[1:50:54] lvlagg: the core base should stay safe

[1:52:29] searlesbarkleyk: Lol
[1:52:31] M12Q: If the house is the yunos name its only a police danger but it would be safe from crims
[1:52:32] giacobbogiacobbi: If you put the most valuable thing in the blue house, even if they raid harry's house it wouldn't be that bad
[1:52:32] LivingManiac: didnt the computers need separating form weed due to heat
[1:52:32] TheReaLAbouOuooo: Cloak 😂
[1:52:33] Omega16bit: I want to say again, each house should be owned by someone different.
[1:52:46] searlesbarkleyk: @livingmaniac yup
[1:52:51] morulanvr: makes no sense cousin having 2 houses
[1:52:57] baker8691: Miss anything good so far today?
[1:52:57] MADxBACKWARDS: you probably should keep some weed though at that house so people don’t have to keep going up north for Re-ups no?
[1:53:02] fitdrip: marty and Uno will want acess if pc up north
[1:53:04] lvlagg: cousin shouldnt have 2 houses in his name
[1:53:04] martymagoo78: washers makes no sense when the VU cleans for 5%. that will be less than the cost of washers etc

[1:53:14] lunorx6: everything inside the house is gonna poff
[1:53:25] searlesbarkleyk: Weed drying slows down buttcoin because of heat
[1:53:30] Omega16bit: @VADICKUS007 Well I guess I'll just fuck off then
[1:53:31] ElWeto: leave in Harry name with washers that’s best idea
[1:53:31] TastyKudzu: Yeah. Having 2 houses under 1 clean guy is a terrible idea. It immediately blows who the owner is for the new house and they look that person up at city hall and see all their properties.
[1:53:33] lvlagg: why take the risk of burning your main base?
[1:53:34] shadowsnake1985: putting it cousin name just burns the new house 🤦‍♂️
[1:53:44] finsane1: why move computers? aren’t they legal?

[2:57:33] limpingmonke: You know Langs "forgot" to split a material sale or 2 along the way when you were both grinding
[2:57:50] Nywro: 300 star runner between a few crews would be just juicing the trash.

[3:00:09] Niktory: windows 11 OMEGALUL
[3:00:16] dumpster_diner: just reinstall man
[3:00:19] lyntian35: do a cmd scan
[3:00:20] hippiehs: i did that on win 10, and then it got scuffed and i could not update anymore and had to do a reset
[3:00:24] roguecept: either registry is messed up and you need a fresh reinstall or your disk space is clogged up and it can’t process the install update
[3:00:25] CartManner: probably need to wait for bigger updated that bumps version
[3:00:28] Zmanic: it will eventually force u to update when u shut down so fix it before that happens
[3:00:29] Lanthin: Turn off pc and remove the mobo battery to reset the bios
[3:00:29] difficultsleep3r: Update your Bios
[3:00:31] Ryleyy: thats a reinstall, you can try to fix it but it could break it even more
[3:00:34] StoicGranite: Run event viewer, see if there's a hdw/sptware hook
[3:00:34] SubearuMG: troubleshoot the pc, might need a hammer and a screwdriver
[3:00:42] Ryleyy: take a day off
[3:00:43] PalMat514: does it try to restart ins afe mode?
[3:00:44] Niktory: take like sunday or sat off

[3:01:21] FiniteResources: do you ever update your BIOS?
[3:01:25] eazypzz: oof go back to windows 10
[3:01:30] Ryleyy: maybe just outright buy a new pc?
[3:01:34] SubearuMG: @Harry that actually happened to me a while back, right before my ram died on me.
[3:01:35] fender2k1: you can do a "reset" from within the os, which will reinstall it, essentially
[3:01:44] PalMat514: @harry This is going to sound wierd... with the pc off try taking out and putting back in the ram....
[3:01:46] lyntian35: scan for corrupt system files
[3:01:49] YeahSuppose: I'd try searching sfc dism on google and following the steps
[3:01:51] Common___Sense: harrSuffer checksum bad?
[3:01:55] Rool_Gonzalez: maybe Mobo needs BIOS updatebefore windows ones can be applied
[3:01:56] jannepannee: Just search troubleshoot in windows and it will reset for you
[3:01:58] 19StarP91: Win 11 has hardware requirements
[3:02:06] Lanthin: Turn off pc and remove the battery in your mobo to reset it.
[3:02:09] Korathor: Lol people buying new pcs to solve update things
[3:02:13] DeadlyCupid93: OMEGALUL
[3:02:13] CuppaT_XYZ: @Harry this is the most ridics thing but unplug every usb except keyboard and mice

[3:03:34] Ryleyy: id wait till stream is over
[3:03:37] CuppaT_XYZ: its one of those "take a day and just deal with it" things
[3:03:37] BongCheadle: whatever you do harry just backup your personal files elsewhere also
[3:03:40] fender2k1: @tsebaka do this if you can
[3:03:44] Gl0we_: pro tip probly son't do this while running gta

[3:04:43] Tydorz: neither
[3:04:43] disorder1232: its in windows
[3:04:44] Gl0we_: @harry get the update number and search for the symptons with it you'll get a better idea of the cuase

[3:04:46] disorder1232: not program files
[3:04:47] CuppaT_XYZ: @Harry The Software Distribution folder in the Windows operating system is a folder in the Windows directory. It is used to temporarily store files that may be needed to install Windows Update on your computer.
[3:04:48] TheRejectsAzFTwitch: I would look for a video on YouTube before trusting Twitch chat
[3:04:49] r3turn2sender: c:\windows\

[3:05:25] Proxyiy: nah
[3:05:26] Avayden: Got this guy doing solo sani while he troubleshoots
[3:05:27] Tydorz: nah
[3:05:29] tsebaka: keep the folder I think

[3:05:55] xdaruken: that's a relatively safe folder to delete the contents of, worst case it has to redownload some shit
[3:05:56] Jookmaster: f
[3:05:59] flemmlix: o7
[3:06:02] tsebaka: Now goto windows update and scan to redownload the files.

[6:24:14] Goddlin: Dude, it doesn't matter where you start. You look at the puzzle as a whole and work backwards.
[6:24:15] Bloodstalker101: dam it Larry was right it makes sense to old folks

[6:27:01] dootadoo: Prioritize the corners first
[6:27:01] JoeKsova: gotta slow down, more time than you think
[6:27:01] sebastian2395: yes
[6:27:03] ForgetMidnight: if they are on one side, you gotta work the opposite one so they can match when they fall
[6:27:06] baker8691: I have no idea what even needs to be done. Lol
[6:27:09] Lanthin: So they fall down and move to the left. You have to go right to left
[6:27:09] alotofrandomcrap: if you see a single, think twice about clicking one of the same color
[6:27:11] bygoneflygon: pick a color, start from the top. makes it easier for me

[6:27:15] tannerrobbz: Harder than magnets
[6:27:15] hippiehs: they fall down to bottom left
[6:27:17] wilson060: its just sometimes the first move is super important and others that are easier
[6:27:17] blazin_4: it’s candy crush, but also like slots like Marty said
[6:27:20] Niktory: to me youre just pressing random colors
[6:27:20] martymagoo78: should get someone in your group
[6:27:23] Frozencurse: we need Wagneto
[6:27:29] ME4D_: when you have a group of them don’t click it until u know all that color has a pairing
[6:27:30] mrdumpling420: Do you think this ac stuff is fn with your rep at the same yard
[6:27:32] mrdumpling420: Sani
[6:27:33] SomeCallMeSuperman: maybe watch over Yuno's shoulder?
[6:27:35] IvyOlive: look at it like rows thaat drop down
[6:27:37] notched_: If they fall the bottom blocks stay as they are
[6:27:40] Jettin: robbery contracts like house robberies (AI houses)
[6:27:46] Jettin: ?
[6:27:46] robbersresek: there was a few you nearly had but chose wrong at the last hurdle
[6:27:48] JoeKsova: no, don’t get isolated first,just ensure every block you clear doesn’t create a new isolation
[6:27:51] hdloggy: I think I just gotta slow down you click once then just panic click
[6:28:01] watermelontoboggan: The goal is to group singles
[6:28:03] Sablotron: gotta analyze what will connect the single ones on the bottom left. harrNODDERS
[6:28:07] truckthunders: The only trick to it is to figure out which color blocks will fall into place with like colors. There's no trick to it.
[6:28:10] Niktory: what if you just click the one on the bottom left
[6:28:14] ZoiraX: What if you don't click that color of bottom left
[6:28:16] seuta: Can you click single ones as long as the remaining ones are in multiples of 2s?
[6:28:18] thetheanko: when there is bottom left you need to leave that color last
[6:28:24] Zmanic: then u do that color last
[6:28:25] ForgetMidnight: are you still signed in? or does he kick you
[6:28:30] thumphah: before you click, think of what will happen after clicking
[6:28:39] Deadstick2: It's just candy crush, you got this
[6:28:41] c000ls: LUL
[6:28:42] Eoghan_OMalley: You need to think about affecting pairs when you delete a colour on the bottom row, sometimes there's 2 grouped that you separate and it costs you
[6:28:46] SpilledNuts: I think you look at the most bottom left isolated block, then do every other color around that block and ideally end up with only that color left
[6:28:51] shiifon: @Jettin no laundromatand ammunition
[6:28:55] Niktory: so like youre trying to get to just one color or what >?
[6:29:00] lorikchan: Its reverse tetris kinda
[6:29:02] deX_LQ: Its called "Same Game"
[6:29:03] amused2: Is there a timer on solving or can you take your time?
[6:29:07] Lanthin: I used to play this game and can't remember the name
[6:29:11] quadity2: One most attempts you had like double the time you did it in
[6:29:11] jambag00: jetpack joyride
[6:29:12] Goddlin: It is literally candy crush
[6:29:12] MidnightSalami: lookup Same Game by Simon to practice along with Harry
[6:29:12] giacobbogiacobbi: It's candy crush+2048
[6:29:12] KrisCat: it's similar, you just don't have more blocks falling in.
[6:29:15] GaiGenX: I think the strat is just trying to connect the colors to themselves. Some seem impossible though.
[6:29:15] chalkiewhite: does this lower your sani rep?
[6:29:16] vik_ortiz: I believe in you Warry
[6:29:17] MohDraws: Probably panicking Harry, maybe take an extra sec to think it thru
[6:29:19] Fliptemprr: @Harry skill issue ?
[6:29:21] reskeezy: Candy crush plus
[6:29:21] Eoghan_OMalley: Timer is at the bottom
[6:29:22] filthy_flank: candy crush and Tetris baby
[6:29:25] Sablotron: he's trying to eliminate colors by pairing blocks of the same color. single blocks at the end fail the hack
[6:29:27] MadAceHatter: Wuss~
[6:29:27] joshbankai: Same Game is fairly easy, imo
[6:29:28] uncannyzim: Yea. It's pretty tough. I like to think of it as Bejeweled.
[6:29:29] truckthunders: You have to see what colors will fall when the color you select is deleted.
[6:29:36] Viper0922: ye its 2048 game basically
[6:29:38] MadAceHatter: that what the guy said XD
[6:29:38] blazin_4: im talking candy crush levels in the 2k levels
[6:29:40] Goddlin: It's actually easier than candy crush.
[6:29:44] KrisCat: @uncannyzim that's the game i was trying to think of LUL
[6:29:50] notched_: If there is one big blob of a color don't worry about clicking just a pair of the same color
[6:30:05] shiifon: same game thats fall to bottom left
[6:30:10] rejpendeskejp: FeelsRainMan
[6:30:16] uncannyzim: @KrisCat Yea ! ! !
[6:30:25] truckthunders: Don't think of as if there's a trick to it.
[6:30:26] Sablotron: normal "same game" goes up left, right?
[6:30:28] blazin_4: u are def getting this shit
[6:30:28] MadAceHatter: bet the timer makes panic @.@
[6:30:31] Niktory: so you just try to group all the colors together >
[6:30:34] Niktory: ?
[6:30:37] KrisCat: There's another game just like this that uses blocks, but I can't think of that one either. Used to play it every day.
[6:30:49] uncannyzim: @KrisCat I wish I could explain it, but it's like Bejeweled if you had to clear everything instead of infinite matches.
[6:31:02] cinav_: 2048 is kinda similar
[6:31:02] KrisCat: @uncannyzim yep
[6:31:08] SpilledNuts: i think the most important part is figuring out your final block, which is going to be the most bottom left and isolated block, and then trying to work around that block to make sure it's paired by the end
[6:31:12] joshbankai: @KrisCat I feel like a lot of the hacks are like that... the VAR hack can fk off tho
[6:31:20] turbodyrock: Chatting
[6:31:22] truckthunders: Yeah, download bejeweled and play it a few times
[6:31:29] HHdrummer: GTA Rain ASMR
[6:31:47] OccasionalTryHard: I feel like taking out the big blocks early as long as the 0 or 2+ remaining of that tile, is the play
[6:32:02] joshbankai: classic
[6:32:03] SomeCallMeSuperman: When I fall on my face...
[6:32:04] MadAceHatter: I bet the grinder already practice ooc to get perfect runs
[6:32:05] blarticuspaul: seeing as the bottom left block can never move that has to be the first one you figure out
[6:32:11] shiifon: harrRat
[6:32:18] mnfoxtrot: You have a point about the single block... You could try eliminating one entire color fir anst. Not a perfect strat, but I think it would help you work things out. Sorry for backseatting.
[6:32:22] MadAceHatter: BibleThump BibleThump  Si

[6:58:19] Tydorz: there was a single

[6:58:27] Westoffer: I believe
[6:58:27] UnBEATable_MEAT: So bald

[6:58:44] UnBEATable_MEAT: EZ 1st TRY
[6:58:44] adamjacklaw: I don't think there is a foolproof way, corners doesn't definitely mean succcess. Just think a touch more and visualise where the squares will drop, they always drop directly down first then towards bottom left
[6:58:45] sebastian2395: deansoSmoke
[6:58:46] GaiGenX: Yeah, try to eliminate one color completely to start
[6:58:47] itzray1: that quick double click you do ruined it every time
[6:58:49] icemanchad: i think it is random have to look at everything and single out the the solo pice
[6:58:49] Iron_PTMN: You can take out pairs that are isolated before taking out a mass. Sometimes you take out the mass and it separates that pair and then you fail because of it
[6:58:50] cliotop: Always think of the isolated ones, how do you bring them together
[6:58:50] seuta: Lets go warry

[7:30:31] iiidaaah: It really varies
[7:30:31] PkTwo187: you gotta get the solo cube to the bottom left

[7:30:34] LivingManiac: i dont think its that set in stone, it depends on the patten

[7:30:39] loveamandaaa: I think it depends on the puzzle. Looking at the whole picture is best
[7:30:40] ksg4: Sometimes, you kind of have to scan the whole things and look for opportunities to single out colors
[7:30:44] vfl865: It's actually Random
[7:30:45] xLegendori: car mini game, air con mini game, harry gotta play mini games everywhere
[7:30:45] iOnlySMOrc: yeah depends where the single block is
[7:30:46] Ydomat: essentially you only need to eliminate blocks if it will connect unconnected same colors. doesn’t matter where they are.
[7:30:49] MeesterKay: 6k repair bill
[7:30:54] lazy_azn_man: seems like you just want to look at the orphan colors and try to get it next to it.
[7:30:55] jayrowzy: isnt the tactic finding the singles and making them not single? dankCrayon

[7:31:25] ME4D_: always eliminate one color and work from the bottom up
[7:31:28] iiidaaah: I think "looking" at what will happen in the future is the best tactic. Cause nukin one big color could just end the run right there

[9:16:03] Iron_PTMN: Every puzzle has a solution chat - Its just the blocks move down and left, so if you dont eliminate certain pairs they become unsolvable after the first 1-2 moves.

[9:17:08] QuackstheRubberDuck: @Fusalol you want the basics?
[9:17:17] lolSMCballs: dont focus on the big blocks, focus on the single blocks and think how to connect them to the bigger groups.

[9:18:55] necro1511: did buddha manage to put back the computer's in the house chat?
[9:19:04] Fusalol: @QuackstheRubberDuck forgiven =)
[9:19:30] Iron_PTMN: @Harry Keep the strategy you're doing - where you make a mistake though is not eliminating isolated pairs that are stacked ontop of groups. You tend to click the big group and that separates the isolated pair.
[9:19:41] shiifon: @necro1511 nope
[9:19:42] lolSMCballs: harry could've easily gotten on of them if he just focused more.  he's prolly panicking a bit with the timer
[9:19:43] Hond0_: @quackstherubberduck in that case, yes please harrBooli
[9:20:12] Fusalol: @Iron_PTMN ^  which also staggers the pair,  unless he needs to save a colour for later just clear these

[9:46:41] quote_me_if_horsen: ??? what people saying trust, lang as the but if jp sends it
[9:46:43] redemption2094: Clap season incoming.
[9:46:43] M0MENT: at the end of the day, yoinking 100 BUTC from JP would be justice
[9:46:45] NicolaFred: Lang so hellbent on working with JP he’s forgotten his own boys have buttcoin LUL
[9:46:45] ChiefinIt: just dont seem needed if you already have 300 coin who knows LuL
[9:46:46] GrandTreasurerOfHell: But the rp that comes from saying yes
[9:46:46] Ark789: @averysadwoodworm I could see Luciano saying yes - he'd say no if they had less leverage there tho
[9:46:46] itzdanyg: Harry going to be the deciding vote watch lol
[9:46:51] ktothec99: That's an awful deal when other groups are gonna be able to get the same bp pretty soon anyway
[9:46:52] z_e_p_h_i_r: only three people, in their very different ways, can handle X: lang, mickey, and yuno. and then, only for short times
[9:46:54] r4nd0mzer0: jp will just get a gun either way, imo
[9:46:55] Bill_Collector: When has extending an Olive Branch to jp ever gone wrong
[9:46:56] sanhobo_: brown brought up some valid points, but lang has that persuasive speech
[9:46:57] roesslerm: @lightstormclaw he is the joker for a reason
[9:46:58] apepi: Take the butt and run.
[9:46:58] shiifon: i can see luci voting yes if Lang explain it like that
[9:46:59] tripletuner: @Rhysing they not trusting him with anything LUL they're using him
[9:46:59] limpingmonke: @exo__23 Pure entertainment
[9:47:00] Poison_ttv_: it feelslike lang trust JP more now that hes not in company its strange
[9:47:01] x_____________________d: NOP
[9:47:07] rasyaaa: why not combine butc w martin & yuno
[9:47:07] lunorx6: he have marty for that xd
[9:47:07] mika04: @theduckmarley they likely spent all of theirs and only a few groups have that much
[9:47:08] wafiy637: i get it ...
[9:47:11] mxckyyy_: my guess is Tony and Luciano says no and Arush votes yes and in the end it's your call
[9:47:11] Rhysing: @coldeveryday using him is even worse, he's a literal sociopath, played by one
[9:47:15] Spartoriius: cant forget what hes done ya know
[9:47:17] Degenerate: jp will get a gun from either you guys or the cops so there's no risk really
[9:47:17] coldeveryday: yeahhh
[9:47:17] IvyOlive: why line this guys pockets
[9:47:17] Ark789: Abundance of caution
[9:47:18] Baludor: I just don't see this as the last time Lang works with JP
[9:47:18] MarcoPaulie: exactly
[9:47:19] 1TrueTyrant: Exactly
[9:47:20] M0MENT: @Poison_ttv_ where is the trust here?
[9:47:24] itzdanyg: he ocean dumped Harry lol
[9:47:26] Bill_Collector: In rp the only thing that makes sense is if lang somehow blames Ray for JPs behavior in the war
[9:47:28] Dalm4s: This has nothing to do with trust, it's the fact that jp shot em
[9:47:31] its_ajc: YEP but at least you'll have all the leverage too
[9:47:33] looshus11: he made Arush push for 24 hours a day BibleThump
[9:47:34] HonourableOne: it would make sense if y’all didn’t have Marty and Larry setups
[9:47:34] TheWitchAtWoolworths: I don't think Lang trusts JP, he just sees an opportunity and is willing to dance with the Devil
[9:47:34] pjrobs: @Poison_ttv_ isnt that exactly what youd expect though?
[9:47:35] Hyperion57: i mean jp probably will get a gun somehow even without this deal KEKW
[9:47:36] tanderson119: he has martin for that KEKW
[9:47:36] difficultsleep3r: He's a cancer
[9:47:38] coldeveryday: @Rhysing being a crew with guns is massive, worth the risk
[9:47:39] jcmcdonald14: @nycharlie212 thanks for letting me know sorry I missed a few days of rp and wasn’t a degen @coldeveryday
[9:47:40] ProngsAedan: Harry had neutral/good relationship with the company before and never knew the conflict that brewed or happened.
[9:47:44] iiidaaah: Also if you get gun BP but cant do Jobs instantly on release, you're still in a good spot
[9:47:44] NYCharlie212: Yeah, giving a gun to a guy who was shooting at you a week ago is usually not a good idea lol
[9:47:45] MarcoPaulie: the history about JP to the bois is just crazy to trust him right away
[9:47:45] Bill_Collector: @harry not like if it were Romanov lol
[9:47:45] saritaandreish: JP is too unstable
[9:47:46] watermelontoboggan: It starts with a blueprint and turns into JP holding up in Harry's house over a chop
[9:47:46] nezzbear: better that yall have the bp then someone else
[9:47:47] ktothec99: If he gets 50% of the bench that is a big liability IMO
[9:47:50] rubano_01: @bill_collector which he does
[9:47:50] ThaTurtleMane: he ocean dumped you
[9:47:51] indyfaria: @poison_ttv_ I mean ya I’m pretty sure it’s normal to feel like that. literally lang gained everything w x stealing from the company
[9:47:53] Sword_Scream: @Rhysing C'mon fella, JP is an insane character, but you aren't in a place to diagnose XQC as a person. That's just being crude.
[9:47:53] Rhysing: @coldeveryday could just wait a single day and work with anyone else
[9:47:53] 1TrueTyrant: I think a Vote is whats needed
[9:48:01] jmikedmif1: He's not your problem really
[9:48:02] franciscooo25: @ThaTurtleMane he doesnt know that
[9:48:04] itzdanyg: lang has a few blind spots Harry Yuno and JP being them
[9:48:11] coldeveryday: LMAO oh yeah
[9:48:11] ThaTurtleMane: fair point
[9:48:11] Poison_ttv_: @indyfaria true
[9:48:13] diasych: if anyone knows how to control JP it’s Lang
[9:48:13] ForgetMidnight: TWICE OMEGADANCE
[9:48:13] emilye: yep
[9:48:16] r4nd0mzer0: y'all will be in control
[9:48:17] Degenerate: @Hyperion57 exactly i think that's why lang is going so much for the deal because it makes no difference and more contracts will come and he'll get one there
[9:48:20] lunorx6: you frien tell you about it
[9:48:21] its_ajc: harrLarry
[9:48:24] IvyOlive: how many more days till we have 300 bitcoins without him
[9:48:25] coldeveryday: OMEGADANCE OMEGADANCE OMEGADANCE
[9:48:27] NYCharlie212: La Tortuga returned to the ocean KEKW
[9:48:28] NicolaFred: imagine Raymond asked the same. Lang would say no. yet Jp did worse to you guys. certainly spicy RP.
[9:48:29] RobLeezy810: @ThaTurtleMane he doesnt know
[9:48:30] Aynumi: harrNODDERS
[9:48:31] iOnlySMOrc: could have been tony monkaW
[9:48:32] NoTaGain15151: it really depend on if those blue prints are limited or not
[9:48:35] Rhysing: @Sword_Scream its not hard to tell, he is only capable of playing a singular type of character
[9:48:35] coldeveryday: gg
[9:48:37] mxckyyy_: W +1
[9:48:39] averysadwoodworm: Doing deals with a ticking time bomb is scary and interesting
[9:48:40] lilisongss: Kappa
[9:48:42] shiifon: oceandump help JP this time KEKW
[9:48:43] sanhobo_: fair point
[9:48:44] yaPPer808: if you can buy it without jp u can always trade a gun for more butc for contracts it’s just about wanting to deal with jp or not
[9:48:45] mCerti: like you said though, give a lunatic a gun…..
[9:48:46] sm0kez13_: the way he creeped up on harry saying make sure u have the thing on u. sure helped harry not being worried about him hahaha
[9:48:47] Hogie48: Luciano filled you in when you got back from the hospital though?
[9:48:50] Yetiee: he was "following" you around the other day too....
[9:48:51] Bill_Collector: Did JP apologize for that or was the apology broadly speaking?
[9:48:52] tarzandaking: And ray is the one that had his sim and gave it back
[9:48:52] difficultsleep3r: No one respects ocean dumps. Your memory returns apparently.
[9:48:53] bird24287: you right it was probably OTT
[9:48:55] RainFire2: But you know JP was the only one allowed the gun
[9:48:55] goodtimes54: it sketches me out cause every deal langs made with him he's gone back on or screwed around but itll make for an interesting story
[9:48:55] CDabmaster: feel like the intention was one in the same if either of em did it
[9:48:56] Futendoji: well, did JP not apologize to you for that??? :-P
[9:48:57] redemption2094: Yeah, and brown wasn't invested in the war. Sad
[9:48:59] NoTaGain15151: if you can get blue prints later it's just wait like 2 days
[9:49:00] Hyperion57: house is fixed Pog
[9:49:02] turbodyrock: +1
[9:49:04] itzdanyg: even if the group is in control JP will stop at nothing if he’s crossed
[9:49:05] KrisCat: @NicolaFred luckily, the only thing that's happening is he's giving them a bunch of butcoin. They could just take it and not give him anything lol
[9:49:08] lordcooterkilla: brown is equally wary of ex/company harrNODDERS
[9:49:09] ForgetMidnight: You are wrong Harry, Im pretty sure Earthwell was there and snitched on JP Kappa

[9:52:43] its_ajc: Tony will be interesting, since he wasnt really in the war @Harry
[9:52:44] Bill_Collector: I just think it's too soon like you said Harry
[9:52:45] Just7Vinny: is JP trying to join?
[9:52:46] mrdumpling420: Fuck Jean Paul. Lol let's talk about pancakes hahah @harry
[9:52:47] franciscooo25: The pushers are probably more inclined to have guns
[9:52:47] redemption2094: It's a easy Yes I reckon
[9:52:48] seanbball14: Between Marty Larry and yunos setups there should be more than enough to cover with a small buffer
[9:52:50] averysadwoodworm: Lang -yes Arush- Yes Tony- Yes Luciano -maybe yes maybe No??
[9:52:51] Yaszmina369: what is the vote for exactly?
[9:52:51] NiNgasm: @zazmania Luc said at the meeting that people are stupid to take him in KEKW
[9:52:52] msdeell: you can tell them together -
[9:52:53] bbriar: Blueprint gonna be long gone before yall decide KEKW
[9:52:54] darth_maz: i think the crew has enough butcoin to do what they want themselves why invite the devil to eat with you
[9:52:54] c000ls: Octo is going to vote yes... PepeLaugh
[9:52:54] TheWitchAtWoolworths: will Tony even be awake? LUL
[9:53:00] charging_badger: at that point it’s on you
[9:53:02] Rhysing: he didnt warn them
[9:53:04] zdrago666: Luci and Tony say no Lang and Speedy say yes Brown is the tiebreaker
[9:53:06] coldeveryday: @TheWitchAtWoolworths email
[9:53:07] reichenbachs: @c000ls, can he vote?
[9:53:10] Baludor: I think Brown and Arush are the only ones that won't vote with Lang most times
[9:53:15] Rhysing: others did, and he gaslight to say they were lying
[9:53:18] saritaandreish: @averysadwoodworm true, Luciano doesn't decide anything lol
[9:53:20] Kako0404: It's good to check and balance so Lang is reminded not to over promise potential deals.
[9:53:20] yubihunter: @robertdoso tbh that is because only JP has a gun KEKW If other people do too I am sure they will shoot as well
[9:53:21] punishedkai: TheWitchAtWoolworths i love your name OMEGADANCE
[9:53:26] TheWitchAtWoolworths: @coldeveryday my immersion bruh LUL

[9:53:43] bahartin: 3rd car Pog
[9:53:46] xzinnia102016: is that octo car??
[9:53:48] Bill_Collector: It still doesn't really make sense because you as a crew can earn enough btc for this alone but lang obviously sees some value in extending an Olive Branch when jp is at rock bottom
[9:53:51] jhen01: harrSTEER harrSTEER harrSTEER
[9:53:54] shiifon: LUL
[9:53:57] am_kuro: 3rd car juice it up

[9:54:06] TheWitchAtWoolworths: @punishedkai thank you! it's an obscure critical role reference
[9:54:06] roesslerm: its funny the bois employ two tech guys and no one asks them how many coins they have  LUL
[9:54:07] coldeveryday: LMAO

[9:54:18] rob6002: To instantly regret lol
[9:54:22] eliteviewer77: Marty told them he was doing a rug pull, they didn't listen @harry
[9:54:27] redemption2094: @bill_collector Exactly
[9:54:33] Korathor: "I'll never buy another car" harrCOPE harrCOPE harrCOPE
[9:54:36] goodtimes54: idk why you arent treasurer u seem great at holding onto money lol
[9:54:40] n8richards: test driving cars all day
[9:54:42] c000ls: Harry is going to purchase a hydrogen fuel car next
[9:54:49] NYCharlie212: @bill_collector i think the thing is also the power is easily in the boy's hands.  depending on how the blueprint works they can either scam JP of his btc or just give him 1 gun out of however many the BP can make and tell him to kick rocks
[9:55:03] darth_maz: doesnt really matter if the company was warned or not, jp is not to be trusted period
[9:55:07] Nightbot: PLEASE DO NOT META! Harry can only use information that his character knows in-game. Anything else is meta-gaming and won't be acted upon. If you continuously try to meta you will be timed out, or BANNED.
[9:55:17] rob6002: Yea, jp won't co
[9:55:18] indyfaria: @darth_maz I mean they were warned lmao
[9:55:19] its_ajc: @Bill_Collector it'll be interesting because they can just say they only get 2 guns, and give him the 1 gun. but in reality they have like 50 guns available or something
[9:55:20] Bill_Collector: I suppose extending an Olive Branch to jp is good for if and when he re-establishes himself even at just an alliance level of friendship
[9:55:23] shiifon: harrNODDERS
[9:55:31] its_ajc: @Harry clip queue today?
[9:55:33] speedy5II: How much will you get paid this friday
[9:55:38] c000ls: lol
[9:55:44] reichenbachs: practice makes perfect
[9:55:47] NYCharlie212: @bill_collector yeah - keep your friends close and your enemies closer

[9:55:51] veriquay: classic
[9:55:52] mrdumpling420: @harry you check your sani rep after you did the ac job
[9:55:54] Alchavezz: boosting was alot easier then this hack
[9:55:55] Bill_Collector: @nycharlie212 exactly
[9:55:58] Dalm4s: I USED TO BE A MAN OF PATIENCE
[9:55:59] coldeveryday: BOOSTIN BOOSTIN BOOSTIN
[9:56:00] saritaandreish: How long are the days in 4.0?
[9:56:08] limpingmonke: 90 day Fiance marathon
[9:56:23] Bill_Collector: JP as a freelancing agent 47 is always a good joker card in the back pocket
[9:56:28] am_kuro: full time crim
[9:56:38] joshbankai: I'm guessing they'll add more squares as you increase rep with the AC to make it difficult
[9:56:38] eljerble: I thought the dons are not getting a kick back this week
[9:56:40] mrfunvg: Clueless Surely
[9:56:41] jbeazy850: you were in the zone earlier and got like 3 strait you will get it no doubt
[9:56:45] ydtan: juice it up PogChamp
[9:56:48] livemico7: still so much more dirty then washed though
[9:56:51] Lutre: @punishedkai crime pays so well that they've had trouble cleaning the cash at a sustainable rate
[9:56:51] indyfaria: didnt lang say that none of the dons will get payed this week?
[9:56:57] redemption2094: @its_ajc it'll be meta how many guns the bp can make.
[9:56:57] JohnnyMack__: even after buying the house?
[9:57:05] Bupiniak: Will Harry ever go back to sanitation ?

[9:57:35] livemico7: can more then 1 of them use the vu?
[9:57:37] Bill_Collector: Dirty or clean

[9:57:45] alex8749: chewsday
[9:57:48] indyfaria: true true
[9:57:48] tanderson119: surely
[9:57:53] Nightbot: PLEASE DO NOT META! Harry can only use information that his character knows in-game. Anything else is meta-gaming and won't be acted upon. If you continuously try to meta you will be timed out, or BANNED.
[9:58:06] Evo_Me: is this his new car
[9:58:08] jbeazy850: I think tony and octo are gonna have ptsd from house debt if you mention new house it could make a funny joke
[9:58:11] sm0kez13_: was there a power bill jet ?
[9:58:12] Sword_Scream: The eagle eyed rat
[9:58:17] NYCharlie212: @its_ajc forget the new house, what's he doing with the old house lmao.  He scuffed it up so much gege got locked in the basement at one point lmao
[9:58:24] Nightbot: If you have Amazon Prime you can sub to Harry for FREE, just go to https://twitch.amazon.com/prime activate it, come back and subscribe free of charge.
[9:58:27] Sablotron: put it back in the trunk
[9:58:28] yoogeyes2: Should offer sellers 60% in dirty cash
[9:58:31] Bill_Collector: Gigi is hilarious for real
[9:58:34] its_ajc: @NYCharlie212 he scuffed out the PC stuff so I think devs had to redo it all

[9:58:56] Levitucus: someone else done a Lang today
[9:59:04] mike9904_: Or just goto vu
[9:59:05] NYCharlie212: i hope so, if gege starves to death down there that's another accountant gone KEKW
[9:59:12] Daemon_Hood: The crew's bottleneck is the cleanup process
[9:59:15] reichenbachs: VU is the best way
[9:59:17] i4m5c0tt: how long dose a run take
[9:59:27] Bill_Collector: Lang kills a 6th accountant but this time it was accidental
[9:59:30] punishedkai: how much money is 100 rolled bills?
[9:59:39] truckthunders: Would it be worth it to pay the pushers in dirty cash @60% in exchange for 55% clean?
[9:59:41] stoneymcstoner69: Everyone paid dirty then all use VU
[9:59:43] its_ajc: people clean their own money
[9:59:47] jbeazy850: figure out vu at 5% or whatever
[9:59:54] Lutre: makes it harder for the accountant to track financials too
[9:59:55] KingDekar: has harry tried VU cleanng yet?
[9:59:57] Evo_Me: nahh
[10:00:00] yubihunter: Yeah maybe the Dons have to forgo their kickback today if not enough money gets cleaned
[10:00:00] Bill_Collector: This takes into group growth for people at lower levels who will never be able to clean for themselves
[10:00:03] Baludor: The crew cleaning the money gives them so much power over the entire gang
[10:00:03] Daemon_Hood: Current process makes everyone responsible
[10:00:04] its_russo15: then people spend more time cleaning instead of crew stuff
[10:00:11] RobLeezy810: weed profits
[10:00:11] megamanyvr: there needs to be a bigger and faster washer
[10:00:14] mkolbeckart: why not get the bigger washers?
[10:00:15] luvvkoa: designated money cleaners are the way to go
[10:00:20] Ark789: You still need like 10x the amount of machines tho right?
[10:00:24] AsPLaYa: This car is so nice
[10:00:25] spitswap: that amount of cash is just a free rep farm so its worth to take a cash hit imo
[10:00:27] Poison_ttv_: wicked
[10:00:30] Sl33pyJinn: you want to make the people depend on the crew
[10:00:32] stormedcircle3n: Or you keep the dirty money but if u use the laundry machines the crew gets a cut of it
[10:00:32] Ark789: Basically need a laundromat
[10:00:34] Hogie48: The larger washing machines surely are better though right?
[10:00:34] its_ajc: in the river soon PauseChamp
[10:00:35] Mimick08: I think once its fleshed out it will be good for everyone
[10:00:39] eljerble: I wonder if fishing will come back
[10:00:45] Bill_Collector: This pay structure is a perk for the low level members
[10:00:49] yubihunter: The current system is the most efficient one. People can just focus on doing one thing instead of doing everything
[10:01:01] Sl33pyJinn: cuz the house provides safe storage of valuables and cleaning
[10:01:09] tanderson119: martin :)
[10:01:29] theoutcastboi: I'm guessing the monkey man gives you the grinder once you nab him the six USBs
[10:01:39] rimuuu_: his son martin
[10:01:49] zdrago666: Maybe when you hit 100 with the roof guy he offers the grinder for sale
[10:01:54] HighwayAccident: Harty!!!
[10:01:55] luv_charles: marty <3
[10:02:10] ProngsAedan: I get the washing is tedious and they do that for choking the economy. But that is also why people run G6 to earn money n buy houses.
[10:02:29] jstnbrt: Isn't it just colorized version of casino magnets?
[10:02:49] Oni_mara: Ooo!
[10:02:50] tanderson119: Pog
[10:02:53] its_ajc: raffle soon Pog
[10:02:57] Sablotron: I was playing with that game, found an arrangement that took me 7 restarts to figure the order and a bunch of undo clicks to find out the only 2 possible solutions. some combos are extremely hard.
[10:03:01] ThePepperPeople: i love Marty and Harry’s blossoming friendship

[10:05:14] Cactusdanny: maybe from weed?
[10:05:18] MrPopandhop: after house purchase today, what happened chat? :>

[10:05:30] stoneymcstoner69: You got a box you should be happy at 300
[10:05:30] MrFNZero: yuno is the grinder Kapp
[10:05:30] yahmobethere: Sounds like chopping
[10:05:31] Futendoji: sounds as much as sani as a drill does. but BPs from trash? yea that sounds plausible
[10:05:32] Lutre: sounds more like it'd be an angle-grinder for robberies
[10:05:36] JohnnyMack__: this car is sick
[10:05:37] Zmanic: this thing zoomin
[10:05:43] NYCharlie212: Just get Yuno, he's the grinder KEKW
[10:05:44] failure_in_school: SCHIZO has to be meat factory
[10:05:47] jumpingdonuts: holy SPEEDERS
[10:05:51] rimuuu_: okay hear me out, grinder at the meat spot... KEKW
[10:05:53] yoogeyes2: Youseef probably

[10:06:07] RobLeezy810: Mats are gonna go up in value either way with guns
[10:06:09] umdterps7: I think it's gotta be roof running. Grinders an essential tool in the HVAC business. Use it to break down HVAC units for scrap too
[10:06:10] Hudson_Pain: Too bad the city doesn't start to pile up with garbage if Sani doesn't run
[10:06:11] Sablotron: a 12" disc concrete grinder to cut open walls COPIUM
[10:06:12] Aumilly: beats having to go 80

[11:11:02] sanhobo_: @rinacon it'll probably be up by the end of the week KEKL
[11:11:03] ForgetMidnight: more appear cos you click in the middle of double and when they fall, they split and make two singles
[11:11:14] rinacon: maaaaan
[11:11:16] KrisCat: you have to visualize where the blocks will fall when you clear others
[11:11:18] lolmaiyaa: it’s less about clearing the big parts, and more abt making sure singular pieces get connected to others
[11:11:18] eddieb0822: priority of shifting is down first then to the left

[11:11:53] Sablotron: just predict what will happen when you clear blocks.
[11:11:54] fifthty: @EshaneDharmaPunx KEKW
[11:11:55] itzray1: has to go top to bottom. if you have an opportunity to clear out the top before it moves down and changes take it then look at the singles. you are taking from the middle or bottom and creating more singles
[11:11:56] x_____________________d: @EshaneDharmaPunx ok buddy
[11:12:05] Nairw0w: the world needs Wagneto

[11:12:19] Bill_Collector: @itzray1 yeah
[11:12:20] genus15: you don’t start anywhere. look at the single same colours and remove the ones between. once you get ride of middle ones they slide together.
[11:12:21] EshaneDharmaPunx: Just always leave a pair yo
[11:12:26] Kazen73: i tunnel vision a lot prob im gonna be bad at this
[11:12:41] spudd710: there is 100% gotta be a mobile game that works like that puzzle i swear ive seen it
[11:12:56] Sablotron: there's no "sure fire method" for this puzzle.
[11:12:58] ForgetMidnight: but it is predictable on how it will change tho
[11:13:12] EshaneDharmaPunx: Do big clusters first but make sure you leave a pair
[11:13:15] yaPPer808: you have to learn to predict how it will change
[11:13:15] itzray1: yep
[11:13:16] Zmanic: need to predict next steps not just go for one
[11:13:24] ItsMattyyyyy: identify the solo colors and clusters everytime you tap
[11:13:24] legionx808: need to visualize 1 to 2 steps ahead
[11:13:30] Yetiee: Maybe you need to go to HVAC school
[11:13:40] Oni_mara: @Yetiee KEKW
[11:13:43] dsaurous: try clearing one colour at a time

[11:15:08] ForgetMidnight: youll get there NODDERS its only been like a day
[11:15:20] EshaneDharmaPunx: Just remember you always need a pair, so do the less plentiful colors last. if you can.

[11:48:18] SwimCapp: W
[11:48:21] supertoast00: @NoDont i'm not convinced they're 100% solvable
[11:48:23] rinacon: Frank is in the building
[11:48:26] GreasySlothKing: so many guards now
[11:48:33] speeding_games: DIP!
[11:48:40] IGotItFromMyMam4: how much guards there are
[11:48:47] theoutcastboi: Yuno could get really good at this

[11:49:14] NHLer999: WE KEKW
[11:49:27] KrisCat: @supertoast00 they are. the ones that seem impossible require that you clear a specific set of blocks first, otherwise it's a fail.
[11:49:29] vrYasu: COPIUM
[11:49:31] shyness_1: do you?
[11:49:31] Zmanic: Kappa
[11:49:32] sanhobo_: COPIUM
[11:49:35] iOnlySMOrc: COPIUM
[11:49:36] ancientlyre: Kappa
[11:49:36] Nickknows: u somehow got worse u were killing it earlier KEKW
[11:49:37] il_capitano91: Kappa
[11:49:39] russevfx: I think odd numbers are bad, but while eliminating they can become odd numbers.
[11:49:41] vrYasu: I understand it COPIUM
[11:49:43] supertoast00: @KrisCat ok good to know didn't know if this puzzle was always solvable
[11:49:47] rinacon: Are they allowed to use 2 drills?
[11:49:54] speeding_games: that’s still lot of jewelry per trade for 6
[11:49:55] Panoramic_Views: when there is a bunch of one color spread out you cant try to group them up just take them out by twos
[11:49:55] The__Donkey: the trick is bottom to top, click most common colors first
[11:49:57] POOLSHERE: can't be worse than 0/8
[11:50:53] bcbray: ooo
[11:50:57] russevfx: If a color is even throughout, it will end in 2. If its odd, it needs to become even

[11:51:05] KrisCat: you're getting better, just takes a lot of practice.
[11:51:31] exo__23: common mistake is he leaves out the one block thats alone
[11:52:13] gasbrain: HUH
[11:52:28] OGbink: just wonder what the rep could lead to
[11:52:28] franciscooo25: 8 seems doable
[11:52:54] kaumatizo: wouldn’t be surprised if you get the grinder unlock from max rep with the roof job, since the first item was the drill
[11:52:55] MrFNZero: wonder if it leads to hacker rep
[11:53:10] OGbink: cuz this is the only other “hack” type job in the city other than chopping kinda right
[11:53:18] rijayjh: lmao almost server restart
[11:53:23] matchablossom24: hey does the roof running lower reps with other jobs?
[11:53:28] exo__23: but devs also release somethings later

[11:53:35] RazersRazor: Martin Speedrun
[11:53:37] OGbink: some people could be cracked though so many people are doing it
[11:53:47] russevfx: Is the grid 5 x 5?
[11:54:11] kaumatizo: true
[11:54:12] Zallopomo: yes 5x5
[11:54:15] hmmidk17: Some people will have it by this weekend I'm sure
[11:54:15] 1994fordexploder: seems like it's low margin for error
[11:54:33] vrYasu: think you can only fail one time to complete full job
[11:54:54] russevfx: So thats 25 total 3 colors. Thete will always be 1 color with an odd total to start.
[11:55:02] vrYasu: 0 KEKW
