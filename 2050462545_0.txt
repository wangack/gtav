[7:09:12] nukaruka: @lay_off_the_coffee Still going strong, just have to go to its own website to get it. That's why you don't see it much.
[7:09:13] Grafhicks: will be back on steam soon
[7:09:15] RogueGameDev: I think they made Dungeonborne or whatever its called
[7:09:15] sammyk3000: Dar n Darker just won its case and will be going back to steam
[7:09:24] dullposer: uwuFINE
[7:09:30] TK421HasLeftHisPost: @collectivebardstale I hear that. I think, if it comes hard, it probably wasn't meant to be in the first place. That's been my experience with writing a song, for instance. The good ones tend to come easy.
[7:09:34] RogueGameDev: the Dark n darker devs I mean
[7:09:38] DCMoneylove: i've got a 12.8 gig update on chiv 2.. havent played it since 2021

[7:10:14] Anillian: moonDED
[7:10:26] TK421HasLeftHisPost: @collectivebardstale I agree with all that, except sometimes I try to force a thing into existence
[7:10:42] CollectiveBardsTale: @TK421HasLeftHisPost sometime you have to kill your darlings
[7:10:49] nukaruka: Hell yeah, can't wait to get it on Steam. That was my personal drawback.
[7:10:50] sammyk3000: Just added ice Mountain map too
[7:10:57] TK421HasLeftHisPost: @collectivebardstale Didn't Aristotle say that?
