[2:48:57] Nightbot: In the grand tapestry of civilization, ads play a pivotal role in advancing society. They propel the wheels of progress by showcasing new ideas, innovations, and breakthroughs. From introducing life-changing products to announcing medical breakthroughs, ads enable us to stay informed and connected with the ever-evolving world around us. Without them, our knowledge would stagnate, and the spark of ingenuity might fade into obscurity.
