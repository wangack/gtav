[0:40:35] R8ghte0us: 250 cb is a w to lower matts costs
[0:40:41] krisholborn2024: w cheaper
[0:40:52] stanleyx_x321: well I can’t lmaooo @evacarson_
[0:41:03] evacarson_: sucks to suck doesnt it then
[0:41:04] krisholborn2024: means gpu’s are like 2k if you get your own circuit boards
[0:41:26] stanleyx_x321: yeah ig it does @evacarson_
[0:41:46] OC15_: its a way to make people use money instead of just doing sani
[0:41:51] krisholborn2024: shouldn’t count cb if you get your own
[0:41:55] OC15_: its a good money sink
[0:42:49] krisholborn2024: well if you remove the circuit board material it will likely be cheaper
[0:42:55] JasmineDeniza: it’s the same money just different mats
[0:43:01] OC15_: yea its the same money
[0:43:06] OC15_: but u gotta use actual money now
[0:43:14] R8ghte0us: now it will lower material cost this way cause you need other things now so
[0:43:21] krisholborn2024: overall it’s better because you have people who run sani
[0:43:24] evacarson_: KEKW
[0:43:28] krisholborn2024: so you’ll only need to spend money on pc parts
[0:43:43] krisholborn2024: so 1.6k per gpu
[0:44:08] iTsGlitchFaM: That Snow?
[0:44:11] maikyy96: 1.6k per gpu for 200 less matts is W deal
[0:44:15] R8ghte0us: @krisholborn2024 so its cheaper but an extra thing to do
[0:44:19] maikyy96: thats same price if u count 8 per

[0:45:10] nyaasshh: WAYTOOSMART
[0:45:24] krisholborn2024: it’s better tbh - you have people grinding sani for the mats and you’ll only need to buy pc parts
[0:45:39] R8ghte0us: your explanation is so skunked
[0:45:41] OC15_: with the amount of sani
[0:45:47] OC15_: its 1.6k a gpu
[0:45:50] OC15_: which is crazy
[0:45:58] krisholborn2024: yeah it’s good
[0:46:01] louusubwayhat69: cap
[0:46:13] krisholborn2024: sani people get all the mats and you guys just buy the pc parts
[0:46:32] OC15_: with the 15k u can buy parts
[0:46:33] oskarrr7: b4d m4nn3rz 🥶
[0:46:38] OC15_: and the sani group gets mats
[0:46:47] krisholborn2024: if anything it works out faster because it’s lower mats

[0:48:00] SpiritInfinite: those material prices will go up i guess
[0:48:07] krisholborn2024: because you’ll have all the mats easily
[0:48:16] benreed9: probably worth letting Tati know
[0:48:17] krisholborn2024: and you’ll just spend the gang money on pc parts
[0:48:50] OC15_: yea hopefully they dont get only circuit boards
[0:48:52] OC15_: KEKW
[0:49:08] krisholborn2024: @oc15_ they have a lot of the other mats already
[0:49:19] OC15_: yea ik
[0:49:31] krisholborn2024: it’s worth getting circuit  boards for now
[0:49:41] R8ghte0us: Laundromat money is going to pc parts now i guess
[0:49:42] krisholborn2024: untill they urgently need the other mats
