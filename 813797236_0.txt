[4:32:33] HoundSpar022: did you ever do conan exiles rp?
[4:32:37] ProdigyBean: rdrp lost its hype a while ago

[4:32:45] keoiyoiyo: watch dogs rp when
[4:32:45] modifyingtvv: Red Dead seems very one dimensional
[4:32:45] nullis81: cyberpunk is a singleplayer game, it has no online stuff at all
[4:32:45] Flukey4: I think the 32 slot was its biggest limitation
[4:32:46] pepsiplunge19: Are they even still working on NP red dead?
[4:32:48] Zelinc: I think this setting has more longevity
[4:32:49] LE_WACK: its because base red dead isnt really being updated

[4:32:52] Icepick_9614: Good cowboy or bad cowboy
[4:32:58] thehovv13: 32 slots on that big of a map
[4:33:00] creddoi: Red dead isn't even getting support from the actual devs
[4:33:01] AmusingNotFunny: RDRP relies on lots of pure RP and less on mechanics
[4:33:03] cloudboujee: Red dead stuff is ehh im looking forward to a modern/ futuristic rp setting
[4:33:04] VxStephenxV: Gigantic map with a tiny amount of people
[4:33:07] IronXideS: red dead I think is just not the best for the type of popular rp like gta too slow I think
[4:33:15] DonQLus: RDR2 map is too large... need a massive server for that to work
[4:33:16] BenzBetz: The meta on the server has changed so much I find even myself that was a huge viewer find myself watching other things!
[4:33:17] MegaMiggz: @uberhaxornova tbh ive been loving the variety streams though
[4:33:23] zay_ih: I feel like rdr2 has fallen to the wayside since 3.0 its taking so much time to complete

[8:26:47] Stubbynumpkins: @xcrash283x it’s about constants rather than irregularities. You either have to take your weight and make it muscle or cut and define the muscle you have, either way, biking is recommended less impactful on joints than running, swimming is great as well obviously but you seem to not have an easy source for it.

[9:04:46] Arbiter9605: no space for anything
[9:04:47] Stubbynumpkins: @prophet_isaac anakin at the time of losing his limbs is a weaker than full power Vader. It’s in the comics.
[9:04:50] Lextorias: Flippy's so lazy geez
[9:05:03] PurpleFireworks: Could you have a hostage that poses as the 4th?

[9:05:42] alexgoatedz: When was the last time you ran?
[9:05:44] PurpleFireworks: one hostage masked up, with a gun, with no bullets in it so it makes sense
[9:05:50] JustenTymes: @Lambjimb0 It's been awhile since I've done Blanden's voice so my thraot is strained for the night
[9:05:53] El_Nalgon123: alright alright ill ask this question for a gifted sub
[9:05:58] Tim_fishh: pog
[9:06:00] Stubbynumpkins: @prophet_isaac yeah I’d argue full power anakin would shit on anyone. So in that we can agree.
[9:06:01] El_Nalgon123: not star wars
[9:06:14] marcusi23: cg has done it alot, they have 5-10 hostages to help them out pretty much

[9:07:04] Magic50zz: siz is the ultimate handicap lol
[9:07:05] BenzBetz: Cordycepts
[9:07:09] PurpleFireworks: The hostage posing as the 4th could hold a gun with the magazine removed in rp, so it makes more sense that they wouldn't escape
[9:07:10] madpeppino: Hide under one of the desks
[9:07:10] JustenTymes: HA Yeah I still need to do another one soon @Lambjimb0
[9:07:12] El_Nalgon123: oo poop got it first
