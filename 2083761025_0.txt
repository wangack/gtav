[1:16:30] hajimea: Weed grower have to be on your original app I believe
[1:16:39] Sword_Scream: The grower has to be on the main app, or else they'll grow another strain. Sellers can be on secondary app
[1:16:44] dyll3: Ye
[1:17:04] coolwhipice: If you hit laundry heist often,you could have 2 heist app no?
[1:17:11] senlash: classic
[1:17:13] AloofMango: Oh a red sani truck
[1:17:18] jgd2w22: yeah, i thought 4head said app 1 = heist crew + growers, app 2 = sellers

[1:17:25] gostonko: the scarlet sani
[1:17:36] muskin6: Grower and heist crew on besties HQ and sellers on future HQ thats what u doing right?
[1:17:41] swankytiger942221: Wouldn't it be better to use your app for weed then since you don't have to buy the turf again and that's like 10k tho?

[1:20:12] hajimea: @swankytiger942221 No slot for weed sellers left on app1
