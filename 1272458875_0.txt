[2:04:42] dkgrapejuice: Squats go crazy for you thighs, glutes, and back
[2:04:42] WarHeroFromThePast: If you did the exercises, probably means that the glutes are already strong enough and the thighs need strengthening, unless you did some other exercise

[2:04:44] frozln: depending on the exercise your quads would be the primary muscle trained, the glutes also tend to remain less sore post workout due to more "fatty" tissue
