[9:06:57] theoutcastboi: Honestly, with how badly he's treated by the company, Ray should leave and get a warm hug from Mr Lang

[9:08:24] zxxuk: Ray going soft
[9:08:27] AidenPNW: @boxfan112 honestly i wouldnt hydrate too risky and mixed signals
[9:08:29] voidgalaxy808: ill just drown myself in water at that point lol

[9:08:48] RiftingFlotsam: @JaiLotus It's not that they don't want him there, they just want to be passive letting it happen
[9:08:57] Vzhys85: RAY so calm in 4.0 . RAY 3.0 would've clapped that right away
[9:08:57] chechlto1: @JaiLotus buddha went from calling him raymond/ray to buddy or brother
[9:09:06] hillbillybubba1: Hdd

[9:09:47] monstergodd: call x to the meeting
[9:09:50] c4shup: Evening ray and chat raycSanta raycSanta raycSanta
[9:09:53] theoutcastboi: @JaiLotus I'm pretty sure I've seen clips of Lang trying to lowkey convince him to leave the company, but like, I know the whole RP at this point isn't conductive to Raymond joining Lang again.
[9:09:57] c4shup: Hope everyone is well

[9:10:23] JaiLotus: @chechlto1 @RiftingFlotsam Dont you guys think CB crew currently too full

[9:11:01] Shadowdott: EZ 4k
[9:11:04] BoxFan112: @p__dragon that's not how Buddha and Tony operate, they'd take him back with open arms but they wouldn't steal him
[9:11:14] LXXELIFE: robbing the intern straight up
[9:11:17] AidenPNW: @egan_li hes gonna know about the gun anyway when hes filled with led MEGALUL
[9:11:27] chechlto1: @JaiLotus people like speedy and harry have said they don't care about heist, they want to do other stuff
[9:11:57] c4shup: !song
[9:11:58] Nightbot: The song currently playing is - redrum by 21 Savage - @c4shup

[9:12:26] c_hurro: @BoxFan112 they stole yuno Deadass
[9:12:36] MrLunatic_: well especially lysium
[9:12:38] theoutcastboi: I do think it'd be kinda funny for the company to continue to lose members - first Marty, then Yuno - I think it'd be somewhat cool if the company members kept leaving until, at the end, only one member of the company remains
[9:12:49] itsjosephhhh: 2.5 omE

[9:13:42] theoutcastboi: Like, as a storyline, I think there'd be a lot of sadge farming potential in the company slowly falling apart.
[9:13:45] ihentia: Any updates on wong post Tsnuami?
[9:13:47] BlatantMoose: Dragon is actually a walking, living, breathing W
[9:13:55] INKOMPLT: @Ray__C will Ray tell JP this issue with Wong?
[9:13:58] ninecastles: Happi
[9:14:10] BoxFan112: @c_hurro yuno went to them and complained about the company and said it didn't feel like home and didn't know if it was his place lol that's literally asking for an invite the way yuno would ask. Ray hasn't done that
[9:14:17] AidenPNW: @Ray__C do u see Raymonds tolerance as a character change from the new wipe or has nothing changed and its just not as important
[9:14:22] LXXELIFE: how tf the intern profit being part of that chat ahahaha let’s be honest they just get scam all day
[9:14:22] JaiLotus: @chechlto1 i guess, I Really do enjoy TheCompany, really refreshing. It really has potential to be a powerhouse in the city

[9:30:11] PrismaPeach: tell him how you were gonna try to get them to sell to you only
[9:30:12] void5678: Check different storages maybe not just crates ray

[9:30:35] peeeeeeeeeejj: check more options of storage theres a lot, then that would be a better gauge
[9:30:37] JaiLotus: @alexfork3 which wood?
[9:30:40] xsgem01: just give that shit back and tell them to gtfo
[9:30:45] Hypo_: theres simply no way this is profitable
[9:30:46] 23Fluent: theres either a better storage, or a wasted BP.
[9:30:49] Shadowhaox: can you even PLACE that in the apartment
[9:30:49] Vinn_: for the size of those boxes they should start at 800-1kkg minimum
[9:30:51] CorysAlternative: LUL
[9:30:57] ericmw: nice meeting
[9:31:01] asathighs: Sadly these crates need to be buffed to be worth buying
[9:31:01] xsgem01: @23Fluent 3 barrels is more space l0l

[9:31:12] hellokitkit: raycNoted so much effort = not worth
[9:31:12] Jenovaux: bench>storage all day
[9:31:14] HashiraStatus: There's no shot storage is meant to be that bad
[9:31:15] Beezer74: It's not worth anything right now

[9:31:37] latinaholic: Ye not worth
[9:31:37] asathighs: Wait for the buff
[9:31:39] BoxFan112: Yeah there's no way anyone thinks this is good right? 😂
[9:31:42] peeeeeeeeeejj: More storage options then decide. Maybe theres a 1k weight and 6 slots
[9:31:43] Vinn_: until they get buffed no one will buy these
[9:31:44] HashiraStatus: SCHIZO I hear it SCHIZO
[9:31:45] brevanj: SCHIZO alarm means Lang is near

[9:32:36] CosmicQuibble: the alarm isn't alarming?
[9:32:38] J4mb1t0: it will get fixed but right now its not profitable lysGiggle
[9:32:40] tarm38: once you guys give up on them and someone else starts manufacturing, it'll get buffed to like 800+ and sell well, don't worry
[9:32:48] Vinn_: two zeros, even adding 1 for a large storage doesnt make it that worth
[9:32:49] TropicalToucan: @tarm38 mhm
[9:32:50] septembergame: its good for rp for people with houses but not apartments mhm but…
[9:33:00] 23Fluent: @void5678 ngl thats what im thinking
[9:33:01] sneakz6: they get 40 hq wood a day they told u ic
[9:33:04] chechlto1: yeah no one is going to buy them
[9:33:06] SkarredBlue: devs need to add atleast 1 zero to it, make it 2500 KG or its worthless
[9:33:08] ezekiel_093: devs probably gonna fix that
[9:33:11] p__dragon: math isn’t mathing
[9:33:14] SiomaiRlce: SCHIZO
[9:33:18] void5678: check different storages ray not just the crates

[9:33:31] p__dragon: he said it!!!!
[9:33:32] RJXZY: Yea it’s Sadge
[9:33:32] mawrk7: it doesn't make any sense
[9:33:33] Shubank: what did devs say
[9:33:33] Eloex: and you can use benches to craft
[9:33:34] xsgem01: Nah its good f lumber union
[9:33:34] xatonoi: MAYBE THEY ARE LOCKED AND CANT BE ROBBED? @ray__c
[9:33:34] rrGhoul: probably gonna get buffed soon
[9:33:35] rich_white_: backback is better omE
[9:33:35] n9bulaa: !medpoints
[9:33:36] Skinnydeads: and less space
[9:33:36] sinful_desires: time to clap wong
[9:33:36] p__dragon: raycSo raycU4
[9:33:36] dean_jobs: better to just save the wood
[9:33:37] Luzifff: probably dev error?
[9:33:37] ganjapanat: Maybe if 2k storage is good
[9:33:37] septembergame: Aware Sadge
[9:33:38] AidenPNW: be real this isnt worth it
[9:33:40] chechlto1: lumber union can't catch a break, they can't make money
[9:33:40] 100BarsOfDeath: i would give back bp and move on, it makes no money
[9:33:40] Foreex7: talk to devs for sure
[9:33:40] ezekiel_093: Devs Tomfoolery
[9:33:41] asathighs: devs trolling
[9:33:41] INKOMPLT: @Ray__C that should be an error by the devs right? makes no sense
[9:33:42] Diggy_waffle: bench price need to be raised
[9:33:43] Shadowdott: Chatting DEVS
[9:33:45] strangegoblinthing: devs gotta remove that damn alarm
[9:33:45] HashiraStatus: Max rep to get, it's definitely not supposed to be that bad
[9:33:46] CaptainPriz3: I think devs might have to balance this out. Only 250 for that big of a box is not fair
[9:33:46] dubv_Baji: can you reach out to check if the storage is right?
[9:33:47] Gabbaa18: Sadge lumber union
[9:33:48] Beezer74: So does the furniture stast
[9:33:49] n9bulaa: !points
[9:33:49] peeeeeeeeeejj: Theres a lot more options you just need to find it
[9:33:50] khrow: devs dont play the game LUL
[9:33:51] qhrizo777: thats a dogshxt.. better buy benches LUL
[9:33:51] Beezer74: No
[9:33:51] JaiLotus: Will probably be changed in the future
[9:33:51] p__dragon: RAY raycSo raycU4 habibi
[9:33:54] fact0rize: Was expecting 500-750
[9:33:54] BlatantMoose: they need to add a zero onto the end of the storage numbers 150 =) 1500
[9:33:55] yauwright: also you can craft
[9:33:56] Woody34187: sadly true
[9:33:56] SkarredBlue: BP + MATS = LOSS
[9:33:56] munte07: idk why u try tbo
[9:33:57] mawrk7: its hard to get and it's useless like wtf
[9:33:59] chechlto1: feel bad for this guys
[9:34:01] djgagann: Let them do the math
[9:34:01] RJXZY: surely it’ll be fixed if they are meant to hold more
[9:34:01] peeeeeeeeeejj: TRUE
[9:34:01] CaptainPriz3: Poor lumber guys
[9:34:02] septembergame: Sadge jack
[9:34:03] latinaholic: Not worth till it gets buffed
[9:34:03] Vinn_: need the bench to craft the thing that gives you 1/8th of the storage mhm makes sense
[9:34:05] AlexPlage: the bench is smaller and holds way more raycKEKW rayc7
[9:34:06] TheOnlyWay029: The whole crate storage system needs a REDESIGN.
[9:34:06] lilpbkill: hey ray what nail polish do you use???? I love that color!!!!
[9:34:09] KEZERZ: I dont see that business venture working, that sucks for the lumber union
[9:34:11] thedudeway: it should be fixed by devs
[9:34:11] asathighs: IT WILL BE BUFFED
[9:34:12] Foreex7: not worth at all
[9:34:12] theovonthe: they are shit right now, but I’m sure it will get better
[9:34:13] Shadowdott: Chatting DEVS Chatting DEVS Chatting DEVS
[9:34:14] xMike6: Itl prob get changed , the material boxes were less and got changed @ray__c
[9:34:15] Skinnydeads: not worth it at all. crates are to big in size, can't hold anything at all by weight. small benches are way way better
[9:34:17] junpei2012: Grime is a scam, and now LU is getting scam Sadge
[9:34:17] peeeeeeeeeejj: Probably theres a better option storage
[9:34:17] p__dragon: raycSo raycU4 raycSo raycU4 raycSo raycU4 raycSo raycU4 raycSo raycU4 raycSo raycU4 raycSo raycU4
[9:34:18] YUNGENTEl: DEVS BUFF IT
[9:34:18] ganjapanat: Yeah
[9:34:18] Doomestic808: it depends can these be left outside and locked
[9:34:19] xatonoi: MAYBE YOU CANT STEAL FROM THEM? @xqc
[9:34:20] malone9807: Devz are smoking that knock-off ZAZA
[9:34:20] 23Fluent: g6 devs KEKW
[9:34:21] KirinRamen: Sadge
[9:34:22] ericmw: nopixel really needs to employ someone to balance everything. weird stuff like this and grime being awful now makes no sense
[9:34:22] TheOnlyWay029: That shit needs to be buffed by devs lmaoo
[9:34:23] Gatorade_Me_Bish: Same as Grime boxes LUL
[9:34:23] Jenovaux: bench is still more the price on the unicorn wood is just not 3k
[9:34:23] mawrk7: maybe it's bug ?
[9:34:25] CaptainPriz3: Ray sell it to furniture company and get royalties
[9:34:26] Slavowitz: kinda sucks that you guys are the first to get everything cause it usually gets balancesd after
[9:34:26] sgt_peppers: have u tried the chests
[9:34:27] jammin418: it should be worth it but it isnt, which doesn't make sense
[9:34:28] tsarjaguar: Yeah storage should be better than a bench
[9:34:29] septembergame: Sadge Sadge
[9:34:29] hydreixy: G6 and grimes makes way too much money imo
[9:34:29] void5678: Look for different storage or is it locked on the crates?
[9:34:30] jyanikku: Have you checked the benches? Maybe they got nerfed when these storage boxes rolled out
[9:34:31] VictoriaKFC: or advertise all of the different boxes and the people choose
[9:34:32] AidenPNW: this is the grime boxes 2.0
[9:34:34] Foreex7: devs need of focus on them a bit
[9:34:34] peeeeeeeeeejj: maybe in chest storage
[9:34:34] INKOMPLT: @Ray__C I feel bad for the storm thats about to unleash on Wong
[9:34:36] munte07: let them craft and sell them fr fr
[9:34:38] ezekiel_093: someone said G6 devs OMEGALUL
[9:34:39] radlifetv: surely that’ll be adjusted by the devs
[9:34:41] peeeeeeeeeejj: MAYBE IN CHEST STORAGE
[9:34:41] ericmw: and then g6 absolutely prints too much money. it seems like it's not one person overseeing it all
[9:34:42] 100BarsOfDeath: correct
[9:34:43] ganjapanat: It will get  balance for sure
[9:34:45] StaticZapper: I feel bad for the grime guys, all they get is a cardboard box LUL
[9:34:46] TheOnlyWay029: classic 0.4
[9:34:47] theovonthe: Lumber people get nothing. G6 has more money than top criminals
[9:34:47] JaMeenu: Send email to Dev...adjust them
[9:34:48] p__dragon: might need to wait on the deal until devs fix
[9:34:49] tsarjaguar: G6 is king still
[9:34:56] SkarredBlue: How much is BP cost? @Ray__C
[9:34:57] BenC0215: Yea this is one of those over-tuned things that should probably be adjusted to the current state of the city
[9:35:03] 23Fluent: This is officially G6 RP
[9:35:03] mackancurtaincheeks: G6 devs Sadge
[9:35:05] lilpbkill: ray what nail polish do you use??
[9:35:06] ezekiel_093: Devs will for sure buff it
[9:35:06] Doomestic808: im just curious if the storage can be left outside and locked
[9:35:10] hydreixy: G6 is making people millionaires before the end of next month o7
[9:35:10] AidenPNW: the storage weight isnt worth anything
[9:35:15] KEZERZ: Hell nah, not worth
[9:35:17] BlatantMoose: oof
[9:35:18] somerandomguy_97: Not worth
[9:35:19] Skinnydeads: really should ask devs about it, this is so poor balancing for lumber
[9:35:21] ericmw: yeah but it's permanent so that's no big deal
[9:35:21] CosmicQuibble: sunk costs
[9:35:21] rstineffect: Can you search by used mats and see if there's another storage box that works better?
[9:35:23] septembergame: damn
[9:35:23] KirinRamen: you can only make 1?
[9:35:24] 100BarsOfDeath: too small profit margins
[9:35:26] TheOnlyWay029: just remember that day 1 Grime was 5k a run. Lumber always been fucked
[9:35:30] JaiLotus: @p__dragon by then, more people will have blueprint
[9:35:30] junpei2012: Is it? that sucks more
[9:35:30] jellal_siegrain: X is malding all day again... the comapny's days are numbered
[9:35:34] SkarredBlue: Lumberjacks in shambles, makes me sadge
[9:35:37] Vvvviinnccee: banger
[9:35:39] AidenPNW: why would u buy this large container if u could just get a bench
[9:35:43] LuckyS8: Size vs space is not worth, bench and barrels all the way
[9:35:46] peeeeeeeeeejj: Time to look for the right storage option
[9:35:46] mackancurtaincheeks: Wait what, that's not profitable at all compared to other avenues LULQ
[9:35:47] MrLunatic_: lumber union always getting banged
[9:35:49] ericmw: this is probably he end of the lumber union
[9:35:52] cbjester: OOC, the lumber union RPers are considering not doing lumbering anymore because it's such a grind for such shit pay and not much RP.
[9:35:57] thedudeway: so is the value cosmetics???
[9:36:04] max6speed: Yeah but can't anybody just go in your bench where the storage is locked
[9:36:04] chechlto1: should just buy a chopping device LUL
[9:36:06] Bleepinbloopin: @cbjester Sadeg

[9:36:45] p__dragon: @jailotus just talking numbers (right now), this is not worth making a deal
[9:36:51] yauwright: how much storage on small bench?
[9:36:51] jammin418: very true

[19:38:51] supremegreatness: from faring 0.7 or something to 44 EZ
[19:38:54] bajbae: even if you sold buttcoin for 2k, you'd still be generating near 100k/day doing nothing
[19:38:54] setraaaa: You will stockpile on butcoin now, wonder how that is going to play out. If you sell Butcoin at 3K thats like 120K profit daily.
[19:39:01] TheAirWalker: did you guys remove some of the PCs?
[19:39:12] Nultez: @bajbae but that would flood the market too quickly

[19:39:37] Pure36: @ladigon most cars aren't supposed to be good at everything, the point is cars will continue to cause player lagspikes at the speeds they go and that can't be fixed without adjusting for lower speed, like x said, most cars are ssb levels and thats not good for the server
