[2:52:46] 1CaptainRedBeard1: @mohawkdakidd it was a one lifer SBS character. It's a bit complicated
[2:52:49] Sathure: To be fair, that's a high adrenal situation. A cop literally just got stabbed in front of you and the suspect ran at you next with the knife.
[2:52:54] KellBellnf: I feel a little bad because Dean was trying to find cops to get them in trouble lol
[2:53:00] sBuon: classic

[6:10:02] Nightbot: AAAA
[6:10:24] Xierany: @DiaBeetusKoby Ofc, but with the experience Brock has if she's upset by it, it most likely was the wrong call
[6:10:24] sBuon: oop
[6:10:24] 1CaptainRedBeard1: Rocks are basically WMDs
[6:10:27] RadahTatTat: wait have you not seen what rocks can do? AAAA

[6:14:15] sBuon: who?
[6:14:18] Xierany: @DiaBeetusKoby You misunderstand. She is arguably the best driver PD has, and she is former high command, so she disagreed with the call, it was most likely a wrong one. Not saying she did the right thing by going off duty, but OOC it's fair to have an opinion
