[3:16:25] gunblade00: non-disclosure agreements NDAs, or non-disclosure agreements, are legally enforceable contracts that create a confidential relationship between a person who has sensitive information and a person who will gain access to that information. A confidential relationship means one or both parties has a duty not to share that information.

[3:20:17] blickyglizz: pretty slow day mhm
[3:20:21] gunblade00: What is a verbal contract? A verbal (or oral) contract is a contract that's made in person, on the phone, or in any other way that's spoken, but isn't written down. You might think that a verbal contract isn't binding. But you'd be wrong. Verbal contracts are capable of carrying just as much weight as written ones

[3:41:22] Biuntx: need another zaza grower
[3:41:26] mortuusintus12: @RapidIQ the idea on that is working  with the company means they are the company pawns, while when with the vagos they are part of the heads
[3:41:28] Biuntx: maybe add fanfan

[3:58:01] MingsPrio: Is the wall straight?
[3:58:03] Shaun_Thee_Sheep: should probably just put a wall or pillar in that gap like a real stairs. A floor gonna look weird
[3:58:05] ValuableBoring: Good for now SeemsGood
[3:58:09] iZeeMo: @Ming 's going to destroy everything eventually LUL
[3:58:14] lildave225br: gay stairs?
[3:58:16] OnyxScarZ: Just move the wall over to the stairs
[3:58:22] juneOT: i think re doing the whole layout is the go
[3:58:24] CopperKat: I think you‚Äôd save a lot of materials just not having the stairs in that weird cubby.
[3:58:33] i1_Ghost: Temp fix
[3:58:34] gunblade00: atleast no crunching down.
[3:58:42] rickyendme12: Maybe put a wall to cover the stairs from the bottom so it doesn‚Äôt look so weird
[3:58:43] muskin6: @ming just move the wall beside that to close that
[3:58:44] xflame404: isnt there small stairs?
[3:58:47] CopperKat: Just move the stairs so it‚Äôs one set that‚Äôs the easiest
[3:58:52] OnyxScarZ: The wall to the right of the stairs can be moved closer
[3:58:57] pratxp: move the stair to wall
[3:59:03] killing4pleasure: rack almost done Pog
[3:59:07] dislesiksnd: 40 seconds
[3:59:13] iZeeMo: It seems a bit of a headache tbh
[3:59:15] CopperKat: the cubby is too awkward to do stairs in. the back was essurr
[3:59:17] blickyglizz: ur step counter getting up there
[3:59:21] muskin6: @ming just move the wall beside that to close that
[3:59:43] ghutta: move the wall from the other room closer to stairs
[3:59:47] blickyglizz: can u move the 6 seater there
[3:59:52] surtren: Move the wall closer to stairs
[3:59:52] ChoobiOne: or copy the stairs and make them wider
[3:59:54] YoungOllie: I wanna see what marty had planned
[3:59:54] no_q0: try different stares
[3:59:57] juneOT: this is overall a bad place for the stairs
[4:00:06] dislesiksnd: he wall for the drying room
[4:00:07] muskin6: Yup
[4:00:08] iZeeMo: do you have stairs with less steps ?
[4:00:14] MingsPrio: Still looks better
[4:00:16] iam_lantern: why not rearrange so you dont have to deal with cubby
[4:00:16] xflame404: move the stairs to the other corner?
[4:00:17] sneakyPizzA: not a bad idea
[4:00:19] asian_ambition: u guys not doing 3 stories?
[4:00:19] YoungOllie: put the door in the gap 5Head
[4:00:34] ghutta: ah nvm xdd
[4:00:37] surtren: YEP
[4:00:42] blickyglizz: are ur shaders on?
[4:00:44] CopperKat: I think just doing a single set of stairs that aren‚Äôt switchback and aren‚Äôt in the weird cubby would save a lot of materials
[4:00:46] ghutta: yeah there's a part of the outer house stuff there
[4:00:59] GaryT_O9: It's a Alice  in wonderland wall
[4:01:10] lg_spira: hmm maybe you could drop a new wall besides the one that's movable
[4:01:20] lg_spira: not movable*

[4:01:42] juneOT: nothing is right LMFAO
[4:01:46] CopperKat: the cubby is just awkward to build in its more materials than it‚Äôs worth
[4:01:55] blickyglizz: at least he is consistent
[4:02:03] surtren: You can use stair with less steps too
[4:02:10] iZeeMo: bruh the pieces are so small of its not Large or extra large
[4:02:12] gunblade00: idk most the video game i build stuff they jus snap in place n have walls for walls n floors for floors.
[4:02:16] argobelz: cant you switch the gimbal from global to local ming?

[4:03:27] i1_Ghost: your learning all good
[4:03:34] muskin6: U should remove those walls u guys dont need that room @ming
[4:03:34] lildave225br: ‚Äúbomb a clot‚Äù
[4:03:36] SameAsEveryOtherDay: Pretty sure like shift dragging or something duplicates the piece. If you have a wall for it, that is
[4:03:37] ComfyAura: hard part s not having the stuff NODDERS
[4:03:43] Sparcle_: bomb a clot

[4:05:05] GoRibGo: Looks like a good building system, feel like I'd spend a lot of time at it
[4:05:06] Athasin: I personally think the stairs that go up and the stairs that go down should switch positions so there is just one room instead of a room to the right and a cubby to the left.
[4:05:14] surtren: You need buy more walls and floors
[4:05:14] njhvhjsfvshvbshbhsb: @gunblade00 is it gang turf
[4:05:30] gunblade00: yea.
[4:05:39] BigSm0key: @goribgo it‚Äôs sims, they took it and modified it

[4:25:06] dislesiksnd: the overhang is 100% going to be fush line everything up witht that and then push it back to where you want it
[4:25:07] Lenny_Kibbutz: 65 will be squared
[4:25:26] mottarro: click on the bottom one and copy what u need @Ming
