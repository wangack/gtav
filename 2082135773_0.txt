[9:01:14] wildarrow88: If you would have gone during the switch it would have been clean AF
[9:01:15] Gonkish: you're learning and that's what matters, it's a video game, there's no reason to be annoyed at yourself
[9:01:17] lia_2021: That never happens. If the cops stay behind they'll check the car
[9:01:33] xxceeloss23xx: it’s a common procedure by cops they would check the car or impound it etc
[9:01:34] david199915: SUE THEM YOU GET FREE MONEY
[9:01:36] slumvillager: as far as the cops know, you COULD have been a hostage, yet were still beaten
[9:01:48] not_rahk: its tough to time because at any moment backup could have came
[9:01:48] evadcobra1: Cops have to secure all evidence ie the car
[9:01:49] jesscdcc: its exactly what sykk said, you have to hang around, to get experience, to learn more
[9:01:52] xxceeloss23xx: not your fault though, it’s okay
[9:01:55] slumvillager: Mickey CAN fight this in court
[9:01:57] rayen_04: Same
[9:01:57] spiritking1987: it would of been better but you now learn how the cops operat5e YesYes
[9:02:00] ditaleeno: experience gained

[9:02:12] fauxCor: YesYes
[9:02:14] lordrazzi: lawyer, remain silent, and stick to your story
[9:02:14] ariesbeachee: it's better to learn now than on a bigger job
[9:02:17] DeViL_H3aDsHoT_: Cops dont leave cars tho they use for evidence then get it impounded
[9:02:19] jesscdcc: @ariesbeachee lang would have a field day with this
[9:02:20] hi__cloud: <3 <3 <3
[9:02:24] evadcobra1: Cops always have to take the getaway car as evidence
[9:02:25] cawood899: i mean if the cops cant catch them theyre gonna go back and document the vehicle used in the crime, even if they did chase they might ask another cop to check it
[9:02:25] itsbrandylion: <3 <3 <3 <3
[9:02:26] RivenSenpaii: can just let maple know
[9:02:32] lia_2021: Mickey will get you millions
[9:02:38] dee_love16: to be fair. Eli was new and didn’t know when to leave because no one told him
[9:02:38] ditaleeno: just OOC it yeh
[9:02:38] iJoeSilver: I mean this RP got interesting. the "beat" a hand cuffed "suspect" , technically shouldn't have hit with a baton tbh

[9:02:43] wildarrow88: Talk to Cornwood
[9:02:52] whatthefults: How did the cop go down?
[9:02:59] xxceeloss23xx: you can tell them IC that you have to go etc if they can just send you straight to jail?
[9:03:05] dee_love16: the cop hit the other cop
[9:03:17] slumvillager: one of the cops attempted to safely tackle, but the other cop batoned EVERYONE
[9:03:19] wildarrow88: Batons have AOE knock out
[9:03:20] gattetta_: you don't need to use "out of the city" in ooc
[9:03:22] Arujon: jail sequence 1st event tomorrow KEKW
[9:03:39] Yacaboud: woah what happened guys? did someone get them all killed?

[9:04:08] Tkirks: they have to document your stuff first

[9:05:40] zonelelk2643: no worries bro. that is all apart of rp and learning
[9:05:40] monsterh308: You're new no one told you anything

[9:06:06] wildarrow88: On the brightside everyone except you will be in prison together
[9:06:12] iJoeSilver: nah tbh the explanation wasn't great. It the mentioned to drive away once all cops were gone. So all around it wasn't perfect. But its a learning curve
[9:06:13] kopite8: they should have explained better too
