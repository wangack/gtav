[2:58:12] Hesfet: the fun stuff
[2:58:14] nyxgreen3: it’s background white noise
[2:58:18] BigNesto11: Like living next to train tracks, after a while you never hear that train at midnight
[2:58:21] CF_Roth: doesn't even have to be traumatic sounds, in my parents house they have a big loud grandfather clock and me and my family don't hear it unless we focus on it
[2:58:23] ChainSaw762: when I moved from OKC to Arkansas, I hard a hard time sleeping at first because it was so quite aka no sirens and ect.
[2:58:23] cistaz_of_mercy: i sleep right next to the freeway....if i go somewhere where its quite...ill never get to sleep
[2:58:25] Dense_Alloy: @SheriffEli thats the same for combat vets, I cant sleep without some noise on so i have a fan cause air is good, but i also have a background noise.  I cannot sleep in silence
[2:58:30] MrGOODFORD: MUH ADRENAL
[2:58:34] tr3lamar3: that’s how I slept when I lived in Tennessee
[2:58:41] Putting4Par86: oh in real life for sure. @sheriffeli I’ve been in law enforcement for 14 years and most days it’s simple calls. very unreal.
[2:58:49] QBDLettuce: PepoG Weren't the rules always supposed to be realistic in GTA RP? Just with the time scaled down to minutes/hours instead of years. Some of these shootouts and miniguns should timeout those characters for a decent amount of time. Then you'd need to use more reasonable means as criminal RP. peepoShrug
[2:58:52] Dracoon: That's why sentry won't play GTA right now cas he is tired of constant crime
[2:59:12] irontortoisegaming: @Dense_Alloy look up brown noise from Sleep Android on the tube.. I have the same problem.
[2:59:16] a_thomp42: they aso seem to not want to wait for the garage door...
[2:59:16] SlackAttacks: If you just want to shoot thats where normal ass GTA online exists
[2:59:19] jagerbomber2: There are gta servers out there that are extremely detailed in ensuring police portray correctly and criminals can't even get hold of alot of heavy weapons
[2:59:34] MisterArron: @sheriffeli do you feel like the powers that be would prefer the more serious style of RP that the family and SOE used to push?
[2:59:42] Ellie_Stark_: I have to have the sound of rain on or i can't sleep.. PTSD hounds me
[3:00:01] Dense_Alloy: @irontortoisegaming i put on thunderstorm noise on the tube helps with the warden also
[3:00:04] Newtypish: yeah, I only got 32k when I joined up with the county
[3:00:19] SpoonThousand: Im hoping with Eli playing on this server, he can affect a cultural change towards more realism
[3:00:27] irontortoisegaming: @Dense_Alloy Thats what brown noise sounds like. It's great. I have not had to take sleeping pills in years
[3:00:32] Ghillie: NODDERS
[3:00:33] Scintillon: I bet I'm completely ignorant here as to the extent of their work, but aren't the SWAT essentially policemen devoted to handling shootouts? So just make everyone who wont follow procedure a SWAT member to be dispatched to certain incidents?
[3:00:51] Putting4Par86: yea you definitely need a healthy balance of the two worlds. I think the experience would be more immersive that way.
[3:00:54] SlackAttacks: Their has to be other jobs for people to be doing
[3:01:05] senate11: Exactly NODDERS
[3:01:18] enzotrainer: server vote...4
[3:01:18] Matt_Kitten: @Scintillon problem with that is 90% of the RP at this point is shootouts. They'd get all the calls
[3:01:22] SlackAttacks: Other than killing and robbing
[3:01:26] Hesfet: insert Skinner meme
[3:01:37] ZoviirChambers: Too  much hate an discontent towards  the police in the news these days. It's heckin refreshing to just see normal police work in entertainment.
[3:01:39] Pigeons24: @Scintillon SWAT can be regular patrolmen depending on the city.  Who switch over to SWAT when called on.
[3:01:47] KingKrowler: You mean to tell me the suspect DOESN'T have the right to get shot at my earliest convenience?

[3:05:21] TeflonVipers: I miss the Heyday @SheriffEli When people built storylines
[3:05:33] Sha1yen: @Scintillon I think the gripe most people have, including myself, is that Prodigy claims to be a serious RP server, has a long list of rules and requirements in their application process, and then when you look at the ingame it's just one giant clownshow
[3:05:35] halfTURK: Was than an Ambulance chasing a dirt bike?

[3:05:50] Dense_Alloy: @Xsparky51 esepcially if you assigned traffic during night shift....

[3:06:37] Scintillon: @Matt_Kitten isn't that the fault of the criminals disproportionately engaging in heavy gun fights because they can just shake off a shot gun blast to the face? Ifr criminals actually operated with coimmon sense then there wouldn't be such a tremendous need for heavily armed cops and there would be more need for real policemen.
[3:06:40] TeflonVipers: KEKW

[3:10:03] Scintillon: @Matt_Kitten if you ask me the criminal player element in this game essentially defines the server's culture, all the game infrastructure is built around giving players avenues to smuggle drugs and rob banks right? So if the criminal element that the game caters to chooses lots of heavy guin fights then you need more heavy gun fight oriented cops

[3:12:37] senate11: @Scintillon yeah, guess with the increased popularity came the folks that hate standard RP
[3:13:05] Matt_Kitten: @Scintillon At that point when do you start defining the heavy gunfights as fail RP? I mean, don't get me wrong, if the server culture wants to have gunfights, sure, but when they take twelve rounds to the teeth and immediately go for a light jog afterwards, there's a problem in the role play element
