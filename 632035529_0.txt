[1:02:28] LordOfThePickles: Yeah, with Kleb and Kraytor on the squad facing the cops head on isnt an option
[1:02:28] 80b101: Can use the raid to ramming them
[1:02:29] Blackerzez: roadblock the pier with them in it
[1:02:31] DrAwesome50: ooo sub
[1:02:32] ChiefianAxolotl: I think the ping pong idea would work wonders honestly. Idk if you could pull 2 bacnk trucks, but if you could, that would be the play
[1:02:33] Purplevivid: so would you run a class 2 setup? now that you dont need pistols @UberHaxorNova
[1:02:33] MuffaloRider: Just need to make sure you don't get gunned down from the hills

[1:02:52] Namiako_: hopefully no air1 ?
[1:02:53] ShadowwGaming: Then you have less cops in cars to go back to PP
[1:02:54] LarryFTW: How would you get back to them?
[1:02:55] Riazo_Yeen: Will you buy a sub tho? uhnKek
[1:02:57] naief001: 3 min

[1:03:01] syneesia: sub will arrive when they're all dead uhnLol
[1:03:01] JaysonFig: airport?
[1:03:02] dominusmessorem: Submarine would take longer to reach; however.
[1:03:03] specnad: might be a good idea to park a car near the submarine if the sub is really slow @UberHaxorNova
[1:03:06] Anch09: 5 min max
[1:03:07] ProdigyBean: What if they just ignore you and you have to go help em?
[1:03:07] raisinpuff55: it depends on how fast the submarine is
[1:03:08] junglefartz: If you start it and Cancel it would they still come
[1:03:12] Kindnuguz: hell yeah
[1:03:13] goldexp123: The airport might be good
[1:03:14] mob_dude: airport
[1:03:15] EvidentlyNova: Your bank truck plan is pretty ingenious tbh, so long as you manage to survive and they don't all rush you LUL
[1:03:17] arianafruits: airport might be longest
[1:03:19] xcrash283x: @Chalupa_Pants what part are you at? im dealling with the grays atm XD
[1:03:19] 420thMagicMan: What about hitting the track at the LSI airport and then flying away in a chopper? @uberhaxornova
[1:03:20] Purplevivid: @UberHaxorNova heli would be better than sub
[1:03:27] ranpoiji: get hella trucks and just fill up some of the roads?
[1:03:27] LacunoV: definitely gonna depend on the speed of the sub
[1:03:27] NobleRaptor_: you should probably go from sub to chopper to reach the plant.
[1:03:28] WhoisDamian: if you do it at the airport you could get a heli maybe to get back to the powerplant faster
[1:03:28] 420thMagicMan: Truck*
[1:03:28] goldexp123: Purplevivid they could shoot it down
[1:03:30] sleepyotter: shouldn't you be at the pp though since you're a better shooter for like a worse case scenario?
[1:03:30] LordOfThePickles: Tugboat the truck into the middle of the ocean KEKW
[1:03:33] Quantumdan: you might have to do it at the docks where you pull the boats because of stuff despawning
[1:03:41] 3spada_Grande: Would city traffic slow them more

[1:03:55] Jeffdog97: test out how long it takes to drive to powerplant from those two different spots
[1:03:58] Purplevivid: not if you got up high enough alt @xddddsorandom
[1:03:59] MuffaloRider: You could just do it behind cover and blind fire

[1:04:01] reneeanastacio00: can you tune a submarine?
[1:04:02] LarryFTW: Or you can flip over the truck so the guards just flop
[1:04:02] pepsiplunge19: I feel like someone else should do the truck part so youre at the PP to help
[1:04:03] xcrash283x: @Chalupa_Pants and dont worry i seen the whole game through james so i dont mind spoilers lol
[1:04:06] Jtl012: thacoopHmm
[1:04:06] SirPenguin911: uhnIQ
[1:04:07] Hannibal_The_Unbannable: @UberHaxorNova top of the mountain? A good chance of them crashing.
[1:04:09] Im_Dabzz: They might just poof out of the truck
[1:04:11] 420thMagicMan: What about using a helicopter instead of a submarine? @uberhaxornova
[1:04:14] Raichulula: plus you never know if a cop just happens to be nearby. Eugene tried a bank truck on top of Mt Chiliad and Snow had a helicopter at the bottom of the mountain before they even started because of a prior situation
[1:04:19] goldexp123: Nah
[1:04:23] goldexp123: You're the most reliable
[1:04:23] mtiaz: the boys did an ingenius bank truck heist last night
[1:04:26] Hi_Im_Tomek: They might just pop out if the door is closed. Not very sure though
[1:04:26] Jeffdog97: I'm betting it takes longer to get from the airport to the powerplant but you should test it out
[1:04:28] bigdongle: @uberhaxornova it’s big brain time
[1:04:30] mortemdeath: I feel like the dudes in the back would just teleport out of the truck?
[1:04:34] omlyn: i think the rear guards still come out if even if the doors are close
[1:04:35] goldexp123: Because if one of them fuck up the distraction it's fucked
[1:04:44] ShadowwGaming: Would getting in a boat chase help since it would take longer for all the cops in boats to get back to cars to go for the plant?
[1:04:44] Mercy1x: IS that tower to your right a new thing?
[1:04:49] KaridonKaar: Maybe have a heli in case they run for the plant and you need to get there?
[1:04:52] DrAwesome50: u usaully hold the fire extinguisher anyways
[1:04:52] Zustex: you are the stall god after all
[1:04:57] leightones: @mtiaz uhnMeta
[1:04:58] Rhaelok: who was in the group again?
[1:05:00] thelaw1434: @uberhaxornova would it help if you took out dispatch?
[1:05:02] Tuckerbonage: why not 2 man bank and 2 man pp @uberhaxornova
[1:05:03] goldexp123: Siz is the stall god after all
[1:05:03] smellyfaces: How many people do you need at the power plant? Could you do 2 and 2? Or does it have to be 3 and 1?
[1:05:06] reposaurus: when is this scheduled for?
[1:05:06] TheGoonSpandini: but if you go down i feel like everyone might be lost lol
[1:05:07] candycat199: candycat199 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months, currently on a 27 month streak! 
[1:05:07] WhoisDamian: Siz DRL Kraytor and Kleb @Krise9939
[1:05:09] PopTartMarq: U could be in the sub, wait for cops, tell DRL, go on land then drive over
[1:05:13] 3spada_Grande: What is Daryl's record at PP?
[1:05:15] megaganj: maybe put an open box truck to the back so they get stuck in the back
[1:05:17] MI7AD_: DRL and Siz are the best shooters if is drl at the pp Siz has to be with the bank truck tbh
[1:05:18] DJPez: I need my ub ub
[1:05:20] moonnthelurker: Didn't you have the truck flipped sideways once and the dudes in the back stumbled down @uberhaxornova
[1:05:21] Hento: I think they would bail
[1:05:21] Rhaelok: @whoisdamian thx
[1:05:23] CoCo11_: they 100% would
[1:05:25] TheBlackwoodHuntsman: What about taking a cop hostage and just running
[1:05:25] eternalism93: Powerplant is top priority though
[1:05:25] 1gool15: Put the doors where they spawn at the edge of a cliff or off into the water
[1:05:25] ChiefianAxolotl: I'm sure Kleb and Kraytor can handle local cops, but once player cops show up, they'll be fucked. So that's why Siz is going to bait the player cops with bank trucks so that Kleb and Kraytor can handle local cops and DRL can hit the PP
[1:05:25] Creazelee: Blaine said he had a black card if anyone wanted it.
[1:05:25] 420thMagicMan: Thoughts on hitting the truck and then flying away on a helicopter? @uberhaxornova
[1:05:27] mortemdeath: definitely wouldn't leave
[1:05:35] tombovard: if you can just a wild chase for kidnapping a cop is an easy distractor
[1:05:37] ProdigyBean: ehh i think it depends on what time you do it
[1:05:38] Kilo_123: Have some Faith Chat uhnBless
[1:05:39] Re1ius: just dont kill them
[1:05:41] Brightlights94: Tugboat/bank trunk with sub beside when police show up. Too much? KEKW
[1:05:41] EvidentlyNova: Instead of a submarine getaway vehicle, what about a blimp? LUL
[1:05:41] Byron_G001: didnt he complete the hardest one?
[1:05:41] goldexp123: Just check
[1:05:48] elamitezion: Depends if you get an officer down imo
[1:05:49] Hento: they did to the boys the other day
[1:05:49] Jerco2020: chat yall DON'T KNOW SHIT
[1:05:49] JackTehSippah: Chat doesn't know LUL
[1:05:51] goldexp123: Try it anyways
[1:05:52] eternalism93: Powerplant is the highest priority for PD. because in RP its literally the entire cities power being taken down.
[1:05:54] nigh7w4lk3r: depends on what timezone and the cops
[1:05:56] arianafruits: doing it at airport would have the most obstacles on the way to the PP through city
[1:05:58] Krypt1kKhaos: almost like chat dont know
[1:05:58] raisinpuff55: honestly it depends on the cops that are on , because some do and some dont, the PD is so inconsistent
[1:05:59] verastrife: It really depends on the cops I think
[1:05:59] marvelo: you'd have to down a cop at least maybe?
[1:06:00] Hento: in the middle of a store robbery they left for the powerplant and just said you are free to go
[1:06:04] Gan_ning_e: They left you before when you did smaller jobs.
[1:06:05] infinitylinds: chat apparently knows everything now
[1:06:05] Namiako_: Jesus uhnKek
[1:06:05] CoCo11_: in rp the power plant turns off all the power to the city
[1:06:07] Purplevivid: pp takes priority over everything except down cops
[1:06:08] BolbiBaggins: if you had a hostage at the truck, would they also leave?
[1:06:10] junglefartz: Would you shoot a little then leave or stay
[1:06:12] syneesia: no HOA discount uhnRee uhnGun
[1:06:15] Harkkyn: if you force a 10-13 I guarantee they will respond to that over PP
[1:06:15] Jerco2020: CHAT KNOWS EVERYTHING NOW
[1:06:15] friedmombo: i think it depends LUL sometimes theyll get air 1 to check if its an actual hit or if someones just practicing
[1:06:16] omlyn: power plant is above everything, unless you use hostages during the bank truck @UberHaxorNova
[1:06:17] iiSUMMER_: thats smaller jobs..
[1:06:20] Jerco2020: 100%
[1:06:21] xRomaine: @Hento Store is a lot different than a bank truck
[1:06:22] Raichulula: I think EU cops might dip but I dunno about NA cops
[1:06:23] JackTehSippah: @Hento That's different than, "I'm getting shot right now" but I see your idea
[1:06:24] iiSUMMER_: they wont leave after being shot at
[1:06:24] SirPenguin911: CHAT KNOWS NOTHING
[1:06:26] MrDonoWall: @purplevivid pp moon2M
[1:06:28] ChiefianAxolotl: Honestly, this plan would be better than any plan Flippy has for the PP so I mean, why not?
[1:06:30] eternalism93: @omgyournumberonefan 1 hostage life vs the entire city losing power. 100% would still leave
[1:06:31] reneeanastacio00: uhnCozy uhnCozy uhnCozy uhnCozy uhnCozy uhnCozy uhnCozy uhnCozy uhnCozy uhnCozy
[1:06:34] Tuckerbonage: @uberhaxornova you can also drive away before they start shooting so the chase you i don't think cops will keep shooting if you're driving away trying to get away
[1:06:37] ChiefianAxolotl: That is all for exp anyway so might as well try
[1:06:38] Ralkero: @UberHaxorNova who all is gonna be involved with the power plant job?
[1:06:39] Hento: wtf is that a Fred?!
[1:06:39] raisinpuff55: some follow SOPs some dont and its pretty weird, they are told to wait 15 min to respond and then some respawn the minute the timers up
[1:06:41] Boomerang43: If you actually down an officer they might stay
[1:06:43] Pepsiguy2009: @Gan_ning_e yes but he is speaking that they would not leave out of an active shooting situation
[1:06:45] MrChrisL: No tip?
[1:06:46] jeannnbean: why shit on an idea tho? the worst thing that could happen is that it doesnt work, we dont always need the uhnW KEKW
[1:06:50] WetSlingo: @ChiefianAxolotl whoaa man
[1:06:52] SleepyZenHD: The cops would probably just split up
[1:06:55] NathanThaSavage: Stop saying pp chat uhnS
[1:06:56] thelaw1434: would it help delay cop response if you kidnapped dispatch or something?
[1:07:00] goldexp123: Don't worry about it, just do what you think is good @UberHaxorNova
[1:07:02] kiroyale: did kleb buy julios bmw?
[1:07:02] JackTehSippah: Kleb bought Julio's BMW LUL passed down for money
[1:07:07] Hento: you start shooting they are just gonna reverse the fuck out of there lol
[1:07:11] moonsociety: uhnS @natebuscusdoesmcpe55
[1:07:15] walruspower17: HypeFire HypeFire
[1:07:16] Jeffdog97: if drl downs someone then that cop would just instantly rush to powerplant from the infirmary
[1:07:16] 420thMagicMan: Best distraction would b kidnapping 6 people on the tug boat and extorting the cops to stall. Might get another date for Julio @uberhaxornova
[1:07:17] Xarthosplays: how much are bank trucks worth
[1:07:19] solidpeyo: they always prioritize the PP over everything
[1:07:23] KaridonKaar: would the downed officer respawn and go to the plant?
[1:07:23] Elduroto_: @UberHaxorNova maybe set up booby traps? Like explosive on the street and when the cars get there kaboom?
[1:07:23] ShadowwGaming: Dress up as a Gnome during bank truck and see if they stick around?
[1:07:28] TidepoolBlue: wait, i thought pepega monday was cancelled
[1:07:29] ChalkRocks: do you escape the scene with a heli then?
[1:07:29] ANDRO_core: What if maybe calling them in with just shots fired rather than a bank truck? @UberHaxorNova
[1:07:32] Hannibal_The_Unbannable: Ive seen cops ignore bank trucks all the time, they never ignore PP
[1:07:33] bootypopper: Some do some dont
[1:07:35] DrZombieGamer: Do bank truck in the powerplant down em then power plant Kappa
[1:07:39] goldexp123: @UberHaxorNova Try whatever you think works
[1:07:39] Francis5795: @UberHaxorNova might depend on the number of cops available
[1:07:44] iiSUMMER_: silenced heavy could be good
[1:07:47] TzzqOK: You thought they would roleplay? uhnKek
[1:07:48] pepsiplunge19: I dont think they would just respawn either
[1:07:53] Sluxi: You can also just test what the cops will do
[1:07:53] koffsyrup: take a hostage put them in all black and let make them hit the truck
[1:07:54] Elduroto_: @UberHaxorNova Also what if they realize it's a diversion?
[1:07:55] Bizzyscrew: some cops just want those pogs so they will respond
[1:07:55] Endslikecrazy: only times ive seen actual respawns are when its prison break after PP was already hit
[1:07:55] conniva: Would kidnapping a cop work?
[1:07:57] iimthattguyy: maybe they won't show up like every other Hoa job
[1:07:59] Jeffdog97: we learned from yesterday that the only way is to divide the police force up
[1:07:59] vinced1cola: vinced1cola is gifting 5 Tier 1 Subs to UberHaxorNova's community! They've gifted a total of 33 in the channel! 
[1:08:00] vinced1cola: vinced1cola gifted a Tier 1 sub to Sho26!

[4:25:29] Socram_98: Gotta stop relying on hoa
[4:25:30] EvidentlyNova: New recruits should form their own C-Team with some outsiders who aren't HOA to diversify, kinda like what Siz has built up over time, multiple different people to do jobs with uhnSiz
[4:25:35] OnyxSolis: Kray-tor or manny would be group b team???
[4:25:35] FreshMatchaTea: i remember kleb saying specifcally once(before joinging the hoa but when he was doing a lotta stuff w them) that he wanted to find more things to do outside of the group and then he started doing that

[4:26:08] kiingkazmaaa: kraytor taking charge is great and hes technically 2nd in command so its about time he does his "no more standing around waiting for siz" plan should have happened a long time ago

[5:31:40] LimexD69: Counterplay is important, the police seem to have too much of an edge atm. More police than crims, better guns, dogs, etc. That's just how I'm seeing it meh

[5:32:01] Xarthosplays: Is any of the crime worth the risk?
[5:32:01] Devomatics: I think the idea originally for this was so people stop hoarding guns and have to keep rotating them out to keep the market going. Though it seems excessive ever since the decay mechanic was added
[5:32:04] jeannnbean: do guns stay hot forever?
[5:32:05] DewMtn: @LimexD69 its fun when its hard it just there's things that are scuffed rn

[5:32:08] Vasidius: I could see a hot gun market. Get cheaper gun and risk the extra charge if you get caught
[5:32:14] Lieutenant_Dani: I think Julio also ran into this problem when he lost his bands and crane told they'd fight the charge
[5:32:16] reneeanastacio00: only way to combat it, is to do jobs right before tsunami so they cant get evidence kekw
[5:32:18] chilledaudacity: @psychochewtoy100 that'd be awkward to play out and wouldn't work as it's not a real mechanic
[5:32:20] Electromagnetic: There should be a way to pick up your own cases so the police cant find them
[5:32:20] azibo448: there should be a way to scratch the serial # off the gun
[5:32:21] EvidentlyNova: @limexd69 Agreed, PD has gotten so large that doing a simple store can become as hard as the vault sometimes LUL
[5:32:22] rentalsocks: use a extinguisher to suffocate them
[5:32:23] gman100: they Got DRL with DNA at the Vault when they were wiped
[5:32:24] 3spada_Grande: Theres prob lots of civs who would pay for heavy sense they don't have access

[5:32:44] theMatherson: how long does the hot gun stay up for? forever?
[5:32:47] Mercy1x: You buy some bleach and a rag from a store then do a 30 sec animation where you scrub the dna lol
[5:32:48] LimexD69: @DewMtn I mean of course challenges are hard but when you tip the favor too far to where crims auto lose on a scuff and then get slapped with losing all their victories from before, its not fun
[5:32:51] FlashingPringle: @gman100 a was on duty that wasnt there and got that

[5:33:03] DRspector: you used to be able to
[5:33:05] fuizon: this system would work if the guns didn't erode so fast making them pretty much a 1 time use
[5:33:06] StalkingDwarf: Pog
[5:33:06] PsychoChewtoy100: @chilledaudacity I get that, but this is an RP server. RP should be allowed to override everything if it isnt too powergamie
[5:33:07] MasterCJ: Cheer1
[5:33:07] Tuckerbonage: @uberhaxornova imagine that since you stole a pd AR during the coffee bean one they try to raid you for it even though you got caught with it the next day hiroHmm

[5:33:40] jeannnbean: Pog manny breaking us out
[5:33:43] Rohshi: @theMatherson for ever, they database all the casings and can quick search for the number when they get the gun

[5:37:58] db_Supra: it was fox and espinoz
[5:37:58] TheBlackwoodHuntsman: its a warrant for the gun if you have it the warrant attaches to the carier

[5:38:07] bootypopper: I thought the entire pd was downed at that bank truck though?
[5:38:08] azure__comet: Whoever it is, they're about to probably have most of the crims in the city descend on them
[5:38:08] FletchSin: @gman100 is he still cuffed or did they finally uncuff him?
[5:38:14] madcookee: ya Espinoz is very by the book

[5:38:20] Tempissed_: it's a weird mechanic... in real life every bullet you buy isn't linked to the gun you're going to use it with lol

[5:38:55] buttermode: Fox did the first one with the gang fight and Allen did the last one
[5:38:56] m0nopoly: yeah in irl they can only tell what type of gun it was shot from
[5:38:59] SpookyCarnage: @3spada_Grande evidence has been around for a while yeah, over a year at least. but it dropped off after CID disbanded for the most part
[5:39:00] FletchSin: man fell so bad for Dex this little cell is boring, but cuffed makes it so much worse
[5:39:07] Electromagnetic: @Tempissed_ The casings have grooves from the barrel of the gun that can be matched to it once they enter it into their records
[5:39:10] JBM_TTV: Dexx PepeHands
[5:39:16] Hento: 5k gun for a 2k job every time is just dumb as fuck
[5:39:19] Autisymous: maybe they have your dna on the scene too then it would make a lot more sense than just having the gun

[5:39:34] Jeffebanks: don't taze me bro
[5:39:35] syneesia: getting the whole charge of the crime from where the casing was found is kinda fucked up
[5:39:36] Tsorer: @uberhaxornova do you think the gun prices will go down because of the hot gun stuff?
[5:39:37] DRspector: heard warlording is getting taken out
[5:39:38] El_Nalgon123: @Electromagnetic ah I see I wanted to look this up but im not trying to have the FBI look at my shit

[5:39:43] LeatherGator: mhmm
[5:39:44] silver_sophia: truuuuu
[5:39:45] Niney_Who: Ballistic Markings are Gun Fingerprints. It's a shame that it's like that though, just seems un-fun since there's 0 countering or roleplaying around it from the looks of it.
[5:39:47] grimmghoulie: all you can prove though is that the gun was at that location
[5:39:48] CappuccinoCup: that makes the reward even more worthless for the jobs FeelsBadMan
[5:39:48] blazinginferno24: truuuee
[5:39:49] Tempissed_: Siz took a single shot at the coffee bean, from Flippy
[5:39:51] jzunh: i think it should be hot gun + DNA for a conviction.
[5:39:51] double00boo: if they have dna AND casings i can def see it, one or the other means nothing though
[5:39:53] Mc_Marston: What's really fucked, is what if you perma someone and then give that gun to someone else. Would that person get the 9s then?
[5:39:54] DandoriDolphin: you got shot like once, but no armor break
[5:39:55] lmrainy: @Tsorer they should either that or payout for jobs should go up to make up for it
[5:39:55] pepsiplunge19: Brandishing a knife? Rip Zelda
[5:39:57] xlord__painx: Nahhh cops got shitted on.
[5:39:58] syneesia: yep they backed tf out of there
[5:39:59] SpookyCarnage: If there was DNA it'd be on the report with the hot gun. They're just getting you on the hot gun
[5:39:59] karrotkake0: only Julio shot you once and Zero chance that left any DNA
[5:40:00] Anch09: julio hit you once
[5:40:00] 3spada_Grande: That's pretty much what's happens irl that's why they scratch off numbers
[5:40:03] morghoull: there's so much HOA on right now peepoHappy
[5:40:05] Autisymous: yeah if there's no dna they can't put you on the scene

[5:40:10] rentalsocks: then the guy that will say they got it from siz
[5:40:11] Hento: it should call for an investigation, not a fucking conviction
[5:40:12] S01idSnek: melee only Kappa
[5:40:14] WhoisDamian: if there's no DNA there then surely they can't prove that you were there right?
[5:40:14] thedrewsky_: Remember your rights, dont speak about the crime committed. Plead the fifth my guy
[5:40:16] brainguide: just don't do crime
[5:40:18] wryinw: you had clarence's ar at the pp/vault though from that job, no?
[5:40:20] noukami: @m0nopoly no? they identify the weapon based on the profile it leaves on the bullet. That's very easy to do and used since like forever.
[5:40:23] Jeffdog97: you just have to never get caught or always use a different gun and pawn then off. fuck that bs

[5:40:28] Xanabilek: It's not like you can even pick up your own casings to cover up either @UberHaxorNova

[5:40:28] pepsiplunge19: Just be a civ 4Head

[5:41:49] PsychoChewtoy100: @UberHaxorNova IMO high crime should pay out enought to "set you up", but then some people would abuse it too much
[5:41:51] DudleyIsDumb: Wish they would make ground with making crime more high risk high reward, and making prison sentences larger and making prison RP actually interesting, because they tried already but it’s kind of failed

[5:42:22] Bizzyscrew: how many people in the city use heavy pistols

[5:42:34] Tigerb0lt: @1mm0rtalhd wait really?? or u just memeing lol
[5:42:36] grimmghoulie: @uberhaxornova all the casing can prove is that the gun was at that location and fired. not at who or how the gun was used
[5:42:37] Tsorer: basically the casing and blood stuff is just lazy rp
[5:42:39] cheeseychill: waiting szn

[5:42:48] Nudgely: melee weapons meta = no bullet casings babyyyyy

[5:43:02] Nightbot: silvermistkitty (: I'll put it on the list for the uhnSun stream

[5:43:06] BrendanJ101: Picking up casings maybe KEKW
[5:43:10] PsychoChewtoy100: If koil was wanting people to abandon hot guns, then a job should pay out enough to cover needed resources and then some.
[5:43:11] toastandbutter: gun prices should go down
[5:43:14] raisinpuff55: yeah go to repair shop to scratch it off
[5:43:15] DudleyIsDumb: @theconfusedimp it’s literally casings that get fingerprinted and checked for DNA. It would be a shitty mechanic to use in rp
[5:43:16] Tuckerbonage: you can literally say you bought it from someone and they will still probably hit you with the crime depending on the cop i guess @uberhaxornova
[5:43:16] aiiiR_: @TheConfusedImp the fact you cant even police your own brass is like ?? KEKW
[5:43:17] scuris: Heavys shouldn’t be 5k then lol
[5:43:19] rentalsocks: casing a dna should only last for about 3 days like warrants
[5:43:20] Brianmucci: Bleach
[5:43:20] Mr_Michel: guns should be cheaper if they are basically 1 time use

[5:43:30] TheBlackwoodHuntsman: either you get rid of it or shelf it but if you shelf it it will just break
[5:43:31] soulclump: a scratched serial number could also be an extra charge that's smaller than an extra attempted murder

[5:51:27] Calvinhood1: @VocalVirus The problem is that the cops are only using bullet casings as evidence that a certain individual was there. No other evidence like DNA or sighting is used in conjunction. So you could literally sell a 'hot' gun and someone would get fucked by your previous crime with the firearm

[5:59:24] RezaQ8: @uberhaxornova I think some cops do it so as if they find the dna on scene and then they find the gun on you later THEN they say it was you on scene and make it a hot gun. I.E 2 evidence needed rather than 1

[6:56:48] TezMate: @UberHaxorNova Only reason cops are pushing it so hard now is because bank trucks get hit harder than 24/7s. The Casings should only lead into an investigation.

[6:58:16] imSammers: sorry - cyr i mean
[6:58:17] TezMate: @ykicka Yeah this is a current issue as well, Reports and collecting evidence only getting done by certain people, so it feels weird for criminals passing through timezeones
[6:58:19] whysooserious9: surpisee new rules
[6:58:21] OzLid: use up that 2mil
[6:58:23] Ayjayyyx: rip 2 mil PepeHands
[6:58:24] Solatice: If you steal a flashlight when you pick up the Dna and casing do they disappear from others?
[6:58:25] fingercuff_docker: Like not being able to go on roof?
[6:58:29] ctberserker1: seems like they killed jail rp
[6:58:31] goldexp123: Maybe there should be more criminal jobs because lets be real cops never investigate people pushing drugs and there's only 4 real jobs possible and they all have more or less the same variance in what you have to do
[6:58:34] cxxf_: use vinnages
[6:58:34] Thegreatchronic503: vader is the same way.
[6:58:34] JBM_TTV: Buy 500 heavies Kappa @uberhaxornova

[6:58:44] placeholder2154: It's real life California law RP "Haha, surprise you're fucked" Kappa @UberHaxorNova
[6:58:44] StuntWax: Maybe when PD wipes occur only "detectives" can collect evidence since technically all the PD had to be taken to the hospital and "recover" for several days so the evidence would be disappearing that way PD can't just get wiped, revive, and head back to the scene to still catch the crime for the charges no matter what AND the hot gun/ casings charge too
[6:58:46] Amazing_Jordy: my favorite "surprise fuck you moment" had to be when they tried hitting you with a warrant for like 600 months out of no where, that had me dying Kappa
[6:58:47] CooCooKachew: @uberhaxornova how much do vintages cost?
[6:58:47] Nightbot: monkaS cvHazmat

[7:00:01] kosmonoght: caring DOC peepoHappy

[7:00:18] goldexp123: @UberHaxorNova Do you think drugs are the only way crims can profit in the server reasonably, that and like gun sales maybe?
[7:00:19] KakashiSaiyan: @TezMate agreed
[7:00:24] Ayjayyyx: hopefully he'll be a cop peepoHappy
[7:00:28] AmnestX: Yeah officers being able to go back and collect evidence after being downed/wipes seems a little sketch as well
[7:00:30] LilSargejr: Scratch off the S/n someway
[7:00:30] thenighthunter: Yeah you shouldn't have to buy a gun for every job
[7:00:32] AnterO88: buy back program would be something else
[7:00:33] TezMate: @iikuggy Just give me your gun so i don't have to buy another when i get vultured
[7:00:33] StrawB3rriHime: time to bring in the ability to clean guns and change the serial# on the gun :)

[7:00:50] DRspector: they used to have detectives
[7:00:55] imSammers: @CappuccinoCup oh really haha
[7:00:55] FlakezGG: It wouldn't even be bad if you could pay like 1-2k to "clean" the gun so the casings are different
[7:00:55] TezMate: @LilSargejr Casings arent done by S?N
[7:00:57] Baked_Penguins: that wasnt a doc, that was siz's prison secritary
[7:00:58] AmusingNotFunny: it's a shame that this is such a malding issue. Hopefully with enough time the admins will balance the system

[7:01:12] Rohshi: @Ceryshen they did before but it got removed, hopefully we'll see it when the server size gets boosted again
[7:01:14] iiKuggy: @tezmate hehe then crims get to hit the buy back program, an extra job for a bunch of guns... maybe some framing RP to go along with that?
[7:01:18] ishkaye: eluHug
[7:01:19] MuchoMongo: Thats a real thing, Just re-barrel it
[7:01:21] Tweker: time to stash up all the hot guns in a single place and get someone to vulture them and get arrested for your crimes Kappa
[7:01:24] goldexp123: Most criminals are broke as hell
[7:01:24] b_pilgrim: With the price of heavies, the only way to make a profit off bank trucks is to vulture police
[7:01:28] Fincoad: @uberhaxornova i feel like they want to go back to the servers old times, by punishing people more harshly and making guns and shootouts more rare
[7:01:37] NachoCanDandyRavage: uhnCozy novaDS uhnCozy
[7:01:39] Ceryshen: @Rohshi oh, any idea why they removed it?
[7:01:40] BADSELF: I honestly don’t think the hot gun mechanics work with the molding system, how many clean uses can you get out of a heavy even, like 2 or 3?
[7:01:41] ob4ke2k: @uberhaxornova if guns didn’t break this wouldn’t be an issue
[7:01:47] Velinth: The other thing too is getting all that time without much to do at the prison besides wait especially if no one else is inside
[7:01:50] griptap3: use vintages instead of heavies kappa
[7:02:01] a_wild_stove: I think it has the potential to be fun for everyone but it needs a little more depth

[7:02:13] HelenOfTroyx2: wtf lol
[7:02:13] ugrarules: use melee at jobs szn uhnCheese
[7:02:18] ykicka: @TezMate I think an item that cleans a gun .. that can be used like 2 or 3 times .. maybe the go. So crims are still forced to get rid of the gun, but have a chance to use it 2 or 3 times before it's too hot to keep
[7:02:18] Plasticq: @MuchoMongo That's actually pretty smart, because that will allow cops to have more investigation RP and having alternative ways of gathering DNA such as finger prints.

[11:18:03] Peydennn: underground uhnThonk
[11:18:04] dominusmessorem: You can get up there within 40-50 seconds as well.
[11:18:09] tjones3323: maybe use camera ? disguised as news
[11:18:09] goldexp123: I say this is fine
[11:18:15] Cha0ticMuffin: why not use decoys?
[11:18:17] birdloverr: Ya a helicopter will see you
[11:18:23] pepsiplunge19: This is good
[11:18:31] Quantumdan: would that parking structure opposite you work
[11:18:33] xRomaine: This might be far enough away to where air one wouldn't even look over here?
[11:18:35] Ceryshen: what does it look like in binos
[11:18:37] GumbyMMA: Only close thing to underground you'll get is either in a few of those garages
[11:18:38] Red_Sergal: you might have to take a chance
[11:18:40] Blue4563: !uptime
[11:18:44] Bummbum: Basically. You might as well go for the best spot available
[11:18:47] PsychoChewtoy100: what does it matter if air one sees you... you are no where near it
[11:18:48] birdloverr: @uberhaxornova someone said there was a police station so close there
[11:18:53] stell_88: !uptime
[11:18:55] Bummbum: I think that’s a good spot there
[11:19:06] casualmit: @birdloverr across the street KEKW
[11:19:17] MuffaloRider: @birdloverr It's not a functional one tho
[11:19:18] TheDarkRedbird: Yeah, there is a Police Station right there tho
[11:19:20] xRomaine: I think further away is good
[11:19:31] TheDarkRedbird: I remember because of Vanilla GTA V lmao
[11:19:36] flickmyeggs: i mean you can get ontop of Vespucci PD across the street vut its soo open
[11:19:43] birdloverr: We can only hope it’s not functional
[11:19:47] Tweker: doesnt powerplant take priority over bank trucks?
[11:19:52] inadeq8: Theres a tent below u
[11:19:59] Arktear: yes

[11:20:04] TheDarkRedbird: They only use the one PD station right chat?

[11:20:08] casualmit: It is functional atleast they can get a car and repairs there iirc
[11:20:10] Purplevivid: just go for it

[11:20:27] Tweker: @xddddsorandom he just said he needs to hit stuff first
[11:20:27] hacknslash548: @Tweker the plan is to lure out cops for a bank truck but hit powerplant as they're preparing for bank truck
[11:20:29] the_rpggamer: The PD across the street maybe, if you can get up there? But I don't know about cover up there so
[11:20:38] 1stSWEETWIN: Your AK
[11:20:42] Jeffdog97: I dont understand how he can do that kleb voice with a straight face
[11:20:44] MuffaloRider: If air one doesn't come then the other spot is good but this spot's safer
[11:20:47] Purplevivid: move ur ak closer
[11:20:49] flickmyeggs: its soo open on the PD
[11:20:54] Peydennn: @Tweker the plan is to try powerplant, then hide if they fuck up thermite, then Siz "hits" a bank truck to make them temporarily leave the PP so DRL can get some more time to try again
[11:21:19] Jeffdog97: @Purplevivid good call, that couldve been bad lol
[11:21:20] goldexp123: Peydennn Not leave, but to come over in the first place
