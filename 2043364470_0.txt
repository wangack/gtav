[0:30:14] ravenhikari: @unkostupit korea wants people stream on afreecatv or other korean sites

[1:07:50] TheBenShee: @KristoferYee about the yeest on your body. i have Seborrheic (seb-o-REE-ik) dermatitis. technically my body is overproducing yeest in order to repair cells in oily areas of the body which can cause to scaly patches and inflamed skin.
[1:07:57] AmethystSunSun: @AmethystSunSun if its everywhere you'd be able to see it under microscopic swabs in a lab but you cant only for certain environments it can survive in

[4:26:30] baggjie: just need more slaves...
[4:26:44] ithurtswhenlP2: Vee said yesterday at the house that she was grinding to get like 1850 chips in 2hrs

[4:28:46] JetpackDuck: Reckless chasing against simple traffict stop
[4:28:50] tarrasski: she daped one cop 8/9 times
[4:28:51] ZigSithExarKun: wtf
[4:28:59] s13epy: PD has been weird
[4:29:02] Neon_crunch: she‚Äôs purposely a bit of a villain character is the PD
[4:29:04] ingridktravels: So ...  only citations/charges being issued are for people that pull over KEKW
[4:29:06] silverarrows47: So the PD is literally on fire at the moment
[4:29:21] Blavod: their cars are pretty bad also so it's probably a combo issue
[4:29:28] Lucsvm: oh dude you need to see the cop drama
[4:29:36] Lucsvm: cap ruth and denzel
[4:29:40] tarrasski: no one knows
[4:29:42] JetpackDuck: No, its probably agreed upon by all the captains
[4:29:49] tarrasski: gives some good rp videos on yt
[4:30:00] kellbean: @Lucsvm the cop drama is so infuriating to me
[4:30:07] KafkaTamuraaa: @Lucsvm tldr?
[4:30:07] hadid08: some people said that the dev had to fix the cop cars from degrading engine
[4:30:19] Fossabot:  Hey! See something funny in the stream? Clip it! Helps grow the channel :) share it on #stream-clips on !discord
[4:30:39] muffinplaysgames: @KristoferYee Are you and the GF doing palworld in Kitty's server or you guys doing your own server?
[4:30:39] Blavod: well after today they do have to get fixed
[4:30:42] tarrasski: @KafkaTamuraaa 8 daps points is the tldr
[4:30:49] s13epy: Nah it wasn't possible untill now @kristoferyee so a dev had to do it

[4:30:59] Blavod: but they had to get wenu fixed last week
[4:31:11] KafkaTamuraaa: @tarrasski YIKES
[4:31:19] s13epy: It's strike points but 4.0
[4:31:26] samzun97: Disciplinary action points i think
[4:31:34] kellbean: 10 dap points is an indefinite suspension
[4:31:34] Lucsvm: @Lucsvm 5 suspended
[4:31:41] tarrasski: 4 susspended 9 fired
[4:31:42] ithurtswhenlP2: DAP is like an infraction/strike. 10 and can be fired I think
[4:31:50] Exmakarz: isnt it jsut dap then not dap points
[4:31:52] mavericks312: 5 suspended and 10 indef suspended
[4:32:05] Crabby_HunteR: Crabby_HunteR subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 21 months! 
[4:32:05] Fossabot: Crabby_HunteR just resubscribed for 21 months with Prime Gaming! BIGFROG
[4:32:09] tarrasski: he got 2 for sitting in the back of a g6 truck
[4:32:10] s13epy: 5 untill 24hs and each one after is a 24h and 10 gets  you on review
[4:32:16] tarrasski: and getting yelled at by an officer
[4:32:18] ithurtswhenlP2: Strict ya. Cops are scared to do their jobs
[4:32:23] Lucsvm: thats nothing there is so much more drama PepeLaugh
[4:32:24] kellbean: and one of the capt is rping a powertrip its insane
[4:32:24] Blavod: it was more than just sitting in a G6 truck
[4:32:28] mavericks312: den and cornwood are both at like 7 right now
[4:32:29] JetpackDuck: Ngl, PD seems like they always have to walk on egg shells as not to piss off ppl
[4:32:31] Blavod: denzel be fucking up all the time
[4:32:31] ZigSithExarKun: haHAA cop rp
[4:32:47] sanzonw: 3.0 was a bit corrupted without daps, they are being strict early because it's easier to ease strictness later.
[4:33:01] tyty3156: if they want people for cops they have to be a little more relaz
[4:33:03] tyty3156: relax
[4:33:04] tarrasski: @mavericks312 den is 1 of being fired
[4:33:09] silverarrows47: @mavericks312 I think Den is now 1 away
[4:33:09] mavericks312: its def a way different PD then when it was pred and wrangler
[4:33:11] RealWicari: @Blavod i mean the whole G6 truck thing was just weird, it was 10min before tsunami, it was just fun
[4:33:13] warnivea: you might get 10 daps and not get out for complete, depends  on the captains decisions, Cpt Ruth just looks like wants to destroy every cop
[4:33:16] Neon_crunch: and the DAPS last 60 IRL days, and if you get more than 3 or 5 I think, it‚Äôs 30-60 IRL days suspension (I think)
[4:33:18] Lucsvm: Slacks and Turner are so good tho, Ruth I still dindt watch yet
[4:33:27] silverarrows47: we have to be careful about meta
[4:33:29] Lucsvm: WICKED
[4:33:56] kellbean: who the cops chasing for an hr damn
[4:33:59] ZigSithExarKun: WICKED
[4:33:59] alphaKenDoit: The goal is obey and survive
[4:34:30] s13epy: They don't have a point atm some cops are saying new recruits only last a week and it's getting back to end of 3.0 numbers already
[4:34:34] SpartanPikmin: how is the warent evading going? (i just got here)
[4:34:34] RogueBear: just got home from work. any new plot for Jay today?
