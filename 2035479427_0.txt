[2:20:58] MrTheDude1519: Think ultra cold rain that freezes as soon as it hits things. Brings down trees like crazy
[2:21:08] bonedead: lol
[2:21:14] Rool_Gonzalez: freezes when touches Ground,not in air like hail
[2:21:14] EnzikFires: dang
[2:21:16] KrisCat: good kid
[2:21:20] Niktory: so hail?
[2:21:25] mechabananas: Penny??

[2:21:29] zxJroc: no not hail
[2:21:29] catloafjr: nvm
[2:21:30] noize: UK doesnt get freezing rain often
[2:21:48] Niktory: so wtf is hail lmao
[2:22:05] noize: @Niktory basically frozen rain
[2:22:09] Rool_Gonzalez: calling Freezing rain Hail is like  calling Water an Non Alcoholic Vodka
[2:22:10] catloafjr: 100 gram joint? lol
[2:22:12] Niktory: ice pellets that i thought were from rain
[2:22:12] waterhigh: how much was this?
[2:22:19] batexcali: hail gets bounced up and down in the air, growing in size
[2:22:54] batexcali: finally falls to earth - sizes from a dime to softball or larger
[2:23:14] Niktory: so freezing rain is actually a thing and its different from snow and hail? interesting , you learn something new everyday
[2:23:21] MrTheDude1519: Google "Freezing rain tree" images, now imagine that on your roads
[2:23:24] Rool_Gonzalez: yep
[2:23:26] n8richards: is this the cocanium guy from 3.0 ?
[2:23:44] Oisann: freezing rain lands first
[2:23:53] Rool_Gonzalez: one forms in the Air,one when touches something on ground
[2:23:54] KrisCat: @n8richards no, he played boris that worked at roosters rest and with the italians
[2:23:55] Quik_Fox: @Niktory Its like when its actually raining, but cold enough for it to freeze on the ground. So your car litterally gets covered in a layer of ice, or the outside walls on ur house -
[2:23:59] Rool_Gonzalez: might be You LUL
[2:24:00] batexcali: yep all slightly different conditions  cause different form
[2:24:01] noize: I think frozen rain is more about the temp what the water is hitting, rather than the temp of the rain.
[2:24:14] noize: I like rain chat
[2:24:29] Niktory: @Niktory so its not cold enough in the air only on the ground ?
[2:24:33] Rool_Gonzalez: Innuits have like 40 Different words for Snow Alone

[2:26:00] Niktory: @Niktory youd think if it was that cold on the ground it would be just as cold in the sky , thats actually super interesting
[2:26:10] coldeveryday: lmfaoooo
[2:26:13] childgoose: @4nics depends where in Oregon but mostly no. Portland is a layer of ice rn
[2:26:55] noize: @Niktory snow can typically form at ground temps around 2-3c, which sounds odd
[2:27:01] DoctorLAW590: eastern oregon tends to be warmer, but the west side is rain rain rain
