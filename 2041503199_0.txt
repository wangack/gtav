[0:01:21] Rachet20: Ngl I feel like James is going the wrong way. The Chaos today didn‚Äôt feel ‚Äúcute‚Äù like it usually does. No Idea if Spaceboy plans to do some ‚Äúdark‚Äù James Randal Arc or some other 200IQ stuff.  I might be picking this up wrong aswell but it also feels like the other RPers are getting tired of James violence. Anyways I didn‚Äôt enjoy James today. Let‚Äôs see where it‚Äôs going.

[3:27:33] Nightbot: In the grand tapestry of civilization, ads play a pivotal role in advancing society. They propel the wheels of progress by showcasing new ideas, innovations, and breakthroughs. From introducing life-changing products to announcing medical breakthroughs, ads enable us to stay informed and connected with the ever-evolving world around us. Without them, our knowledge would stagnate, and the spark of ingenuity might fade into obscurity.
