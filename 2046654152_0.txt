Just an idea. For example, bank robbery, only dispatcher can assign a call sign to the scene.  It can be done in a controlling manner.

[6:23:06] lajmenno: @Ssaab I had that same issue with an old headset of mine. Same "Pain"/"Discomfort". I swapped to Hyper X Cloud Alpha Wireless, fixed it for me.
[6:23:14] dakota22446: Saddies Niko
[6:23:17] BakinPacman: basically the devs would just move the mechanic if required most likely
[6:23:20] RomanNumera: The rp is that he wouldn't talk to cops anyway so no point
[6:23:45] Artsii1994: thats cause your hand band is on too tight

[6:24:19] lajmenno: @KuuyaTJ srsly not :D Had problem for like 3-4 months until i realized my headset was just bad for me
[6:24:29] buddha_hands: it's actual headaches or is it physical pain/annoyance around the ears
[6:24:38] BakinPacman: the way the headset sits on your head can change
[6:24:48] buddha_hands: jesus OMEGALAUGHING
[6:24:53] PurpleHuskyy: dt 770 pros are pretty nice I can wear them forever
[6:24:54] BakinPacman: its pressure on the back of your cartilage
[6:24:58] JTokez82: @Ssaab how much would you pay for new IEM´s , i could recommend some
[6:25:01] shadowsnake1985: so it seems the trash men are getting tired of being shot at and attacked

[6:25:05] streaker85: could be a tumor
[6:25:07] Artsii1994: @Ssaab you have audio tehnicas right are they know for headphone tightness
[6:25:08] russevfx: Nerve probably
[6:25:09] BrokenFlomp: that’s the feeling u get when u die go to doctor
[6:25:10] zenyatta: ....ok well that doesnt seem like a headset issue
[6:25:10] buddha_hands: if it's like a NEEDLE that makes me think something's just pinched like skin or hair lol
[6:25:12] RomanNumera: Oh, like the back of the headset cup
[6:25:12] 04jetta: Yeah I think Bakin may be correct
[6:25:14] ShowHatez: its pressing the nerve
[6:25:15] suspectfps: does it go away when you take the headset off?
[6:25:17] SammytheQueen: sometimes i adjust the band so the cups sit differently, takes pressure off
[6:25:17] dakota22446: pepeS
[6:25:17] woolfdesign: I got that also from wearing a cheap pair of glasses with a headset

[6:25:49] Kasvar: young turner PogU
[6:25:49] ImRexNA: @Ssaab I swap between a headset and earbuds. Headset is a steel series wireless. Ear buds is just airpods. Swapping only when I "need" a headset helped a lot.
[6:25:56] twobladez: get a new headset if pain doesnt go away than start worrying
[6:25:56] RoguexSoldier_: is there a wire or something maybe in the headset?

[6:26:32] zenyatta: @ImRexNA yeah i rotate between my headset and plain old airpods to give my ears a break
[6:26:34] Bluntblower_508: That happens. Its a pain in the ass. You need to go pricey. Just find a headset thats made for comfort & streaming. When it happens try keeping one ear covered if you can't get another headset atm.
[6:26:35] mrperson1234: I love ivy
[6:26:40] woolfdesign: I would just leave that room and pretend that I saw nothing
