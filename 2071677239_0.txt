[0:26:38] gonzogaminggtav: public PD is great i play there and im also dispatch!
[0:26:40] smok3mjane: lmaooooooo
[0:26:41] StarSquatch: Duncan as HR would be a self grief because you would have HR meetings with himn

[0:26:59] ExtraM1nty: I just wanna put this out there, it's off topic more than likely but don't hate the person behind the character if you don't like the person they are roleplaying.
[0:27:03] jd2881: Does Slacks have an issue always being the one to deliver the bad news? Seems like he has to be the face for all 3 captains instead of sharing that duty evenly.
[0:27:04] rclemon_: soup is mid
[0:27:04] deadwoodd_: instead of daps make the punishment riding in a car with duncan for a 10 hour shift

[0:27:19] Smypher: Watching Cornwood deal with life as a civ has been great

[0:27:30] ITZxJeff: Have the captains come to a conclusion with cornwood?
[0:27:31] mizkifsrecedinghairline: Looking forward to seeing where the PD drama ends up.
[0:27:34] Tigriopus: Was part of slacks rational for firing Shiesty, so he has the abililty to swap shifts?
[0:27:35] The_Arrival_: I just love when Duncan is a primary in a chase , that's where he shines
[0:27:36] KnightedGames: I am not Madge at Ssaab just think the PD would be making a mistake if they let cornwood go. On the other hand the drama that it would create will be amazing content.

[0:28:54] bubosucks: was there anything den couldve done to not get fired he seemed to handle it so well, or was it because the decision was made already

[2:55:28] buddha_hands: @zdrago666 he's appealing the most severe charge.. basically if he wins he'd get the money back & the charge would come off his record

See, normally if you go one on one with another captain, you got a 50/50 chance of winning. But I'm a genetic freak and I'm not normal! So you got a 25%, AT BEST, at beat me.

[7:28:12] Toxcicle: Turner and Bones were immaculate during that whole thing
[7:28:14] StamaasG: It wasn't scuff, the air in the tank started depleting when he equipped it when he was in the car before the water
[7:28:16] pigeonegg: Scuff didn't force that level of escalation, will make for good RP anyway.

[7:29:01] Buffalohed: lenny has no rules
[7:29:01] dakota22446: The phrase “it’s just a game” is such a weak mindset. You are ok with what happened, losing, imperfection of a craft. When you stop getting angry after losing, you’ve lost twice.   There’s always something to learn, and always room for improvement, never settle.
[7:29:01] rzocys0: why are chatters so mad when the streamres are not even mad KEKW

[7:29:21] Eddie1225: @rzocys0 classic rp chatters
[7:29:21] wetbanditmarv: how about the fact you clearly are saying don't shoot to your cops at the exchange and the moment they get in the car your cops automatically start shooting, that's disobeying a direct order.....another clear point to be made in this whole situation since tires were popped right away and changed the outcome of the RP

[8:36:45] SarahFlare: @Guielme communication is a two way street, so it's not just the mayor but also the captains.

[8:55:20] Paddy92: @MisterParry not yet
[8:55:21] TimmayHS: @RobRoads the huge red flag for me is that captains both give out daps AND do a high command review to decide if their daps were justified or not to fire someone
[8:55:21] YammersTV: @fraudiola9 true, turner is coming in unprepared. they are going against both max and crane.

[9:52:51] JesusGVG: 10 little daps is a problem tho OMEGALAUGHING
[9:52:56] Hibob222: chat im sorry i said baddd things and got a 4 hour time out ill be good i misspoke :(
[9:53:07] lookingfornothinghere: there is a  reason why they are only 1 dap because it takes a long time to get daps
[9:53:08] Hibob222: saab10 rp
[9:53:09] Rare__Potato: If you can't last 60 days without gaining 10 DAPs that's a you problem OMEGALAUGHING
[9:53:12] Kizzlefoshizzle: It's harsh but it can be worked on and yes it's good for it to be harsh in the beginning to trial and error it
[9:53:12] JesusGVG: if the guy doesnt learn after getting dapped 10 times its an issue
[9:53:13] TimmayHS: and then the same captains that dap people are the ones that review if their daps were valid or not, that's the weird part

[9:54:04] PepperAnn131: Oh and transparency would be good. The officers don't have access to view their DAPs.
[9:54:06] Rare__Potato: And who is going to track all that? KEKLEO
[9:54:10] DCSeth: did you just say minor to moderate to major to cornwood?
[9:54:13] stellarnaut: @Hibob222 LMAO
[9:54:22] MWRGaming: did I just hear Minor -> Major -> Cornwood
[9:54:24] spacelindsay2: people got daps for wearing a hat, not all infractions should be held at the same standard
[9:54:26] fraudiola9: yeah mcnulty track all that good for you KEKW
[9:54:27] Artsii1994: so small daps for first timers shouldnt be that big them countless ones should be longer. is that gonna be doumented
[9:54:33] VenatusVox: That would lead to arguments of whats a major or minor dap, could cause more problems
[9:54:35] Kizzlefoshizzle: 30 days works
[9:54:35] uhSnow: I agree
[9:54:36] TimmayHS: 30 days - full reset
[9:54:39] bahubaker: its more than the statue of limitations in game
[9:54:39] ykicka: tru
[9:54:43] jessielight: less technical with 30 days
[9:54:44] Chaoszero_goc: no more daps, mag dump all crimes, problem solved
[9:54:46] MaSTerSOra701: 30 days is pretty good
[9:54:46] Artsii1994: yea smaller the better
[9:54:47] Afoool: needs to be like 15 lol
[9:54:47] arcticOP: hours worked or shifts worked
[9:54:48] quickwiiddit: yup
[9:54:50] Rare__Potato: Nah, keep it 60 for everything, you should be able to last 60 days without getting 10 OMEGALAUGHING
[9:54:52] Decimated_exo: you were saying 45
[9:54:54] uhSnow: true
[9:54:55] TheyCallMeGeg: oh for sure
[9:54:56] talamah: 10 daps in 4 weeks OMEGALAUGHING
[9:54:56] jessielight: true
[9:54:57] ykicka: what's the statue of limitations now? is it 30 days?
[9:54:58] manilovewakesfeet: going to get too complicated with different dap tiers
[9:55:00] MWRGaming: true
[9:55:02] manilovewakesfeet: too convoluted
[9:55:02] xTurqeh: 10 daps in 1 month should get a medal
[9:55:06] angelheart08p: that’s like 5 tries to get your shit straight
[9:55:07] 0zarruu: No one has done that in a month yet have they?
[9:55:09] VladVolynine: Yeah, easy 30 day system - this  would create so much more complexity
[9:55:09] TheyCallMeGeg: like 10 spread out over a month and half is even meh
[9:55:10] FuZroK: sounds complicated. They already dont like paper work LUL
[9:55:11] Dyloc44: 30 keeps it simple
[9:55:12] nickgmiller: I feel like the high command review at 10 daps accounts for this. it’s not auto fire
[9:55:14] stellarnaut: @uhSnow oh sht its Snow uhsLove
[9:55:15] wintersoldier2712: 30 days for all. 10 daps in a month you should be reviewed
[9:55:17] Puk3s: Ya but prolly will day, do you see den
[9:55:17] WildWillie419: I mean the point levels
[9:55:22] fraudiola9: 1 DAP FIT THE FINE LULW
[9:55:24] dawnxero: @dcseth that's what I heard too. Second time today cornwood is a unit of measurement lol
[9:55:32] Artsii1994: like smaller first time dappers should be 30 and more repeating dappers should be longer
[9:55:34] lookingfornothinghere: 13 bullets
[9:55:35] VladVolynine: @stellarnaut Kiwo Pog
[9:55:39] Pee_aRe: Just uninstall the Dap system all together solves all the problems

[9:56:25] TimmayHS: what's their daps per hour?
[9:56:31] ShadowedSeraphim: @ssaab why isn't it "x" amount of work hours per dap removal. That way it promotes people being on and working instead of promoting doing minimum hours?
[9:56:33] fraudiola9: TURNER GIGACHAD
[9:56:35] WildWillie419: Turner bringing the hammer
[9:56:39] MonsterFuel: man thank god for turner

[9:57:13] z_0_m: i like that
[9:57:18] Chaoszero_goc: you guys never gave den and cornwood thier class
[9:57:19] TraviiiOnTwitch: that idea was presented like over a month ago
[9:57:22] Puk3s: Nice 1 point
[9:57:24] uhSnow: cool idea
[9:57:26] ogspeacetv: 2 week cooldown NODDERS
[9:57:39] Puk3s: Lmao not the idea
[9:57:43] urkuri92: all of Duncans DAPs were completely avoidable LUL
[9:57:43] Artsii1994: turner has a point if your gonna be repaeting the same thing and not cahnge from it then tey deserve to not be here but if you wanna learn from that and grow were you dont repeat then you can do a job or classes like turner is saying
[9:57:44] stellarnaut: yesssss
[9:57:45] fraudiola9: @Chaoszero_goc should learn basic police work for that
[9:57:46] Kizzlefoshizzle: YES
[9:57:48] wintersoldier2712: All dap fall off after 30 days. sorted
[9:57:51] TimmayHS: how about community service INSTEAD of daps?
[9:57:51] JerrieDepp: YES!!!
[9:57:52] manilovewakesfeet: meter maids to remove a dap Kappa
[9:57:52] VenatusVox: Prison duty
[9:57:54] Kizzlefoshizzle: Community service is such a good punishment
[9:57:54] Rare__Potato: -1 dap per 100 hours KEKLEO resets if you get a DAP
[9:57:54] stellarnaut: yesss community service lets gooo
[9:57:55] ShadowedSeraphim: does it remove the most recent daps or the oldest daps?
[9:57:59] Kizzlefoshizzle: And good content
[9:58:02] stellarnaut: bicycle cops KEKW
[9:58:05] MonsterFuel: just no cleaning puke Madge

[9:58:53] Puk3s: Lol here we do
[9:58:56] MWRGaming: Turner needs to tell Shift 1 this
[9:58:57] MonsterFuel: GIGACHAD TURNER
[9:58:58] 0zarruu: tbf just getting a dap doesn't really do anything to teach people other than dont do it again lol
[9:59:12] BigglesVII: @VenatusVox Wax the fleet, that takes ages lol
[9:59:13] Artsii1994: it should be held to there own accuntability
[9:59:17] zuze: its a video game relax rofl
[9:59:24] stellarnaut: GIGACHAD McNulty
[9:59:27] M3disyn: u've got ppl right here who are on duty everyday.. yet still haven't pasted 2 daps at most LUL
[9:59:33] bahubaker: 15/30/45
[9:59:42] ShadowedSeraphim: thats the issue with Denzels final dap.. it was a freak accident. the only thing dapping taught was to never pit because you never know
[9:59:50] Puk3s: Can we name fun of atrsii this whole time
[9:59:50] Twin_Hallow: if thats the case seems like getting multiple daps at once should be pretty rare
[9:59:51] FuZroK: idk. Over complicated. Drop it to 45 days. take a class every 30 days for -1 dap. EZ
[9:59:57] dawnxero: So community service instead of a dap for minor offenses
[10:00:04] dawnxero: I think would be good
[10:00:06] stellarnaut: DAPs based on things not yet in SOPs
[10:00:15] Twin_Hallow: feel like daps is kinda losing its meaning lol
[10:00:29] Mr_Jhin4: 15 30 45 days minor moderate major
[10:00:32] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: preach
[10:00:40] lookingfornothinghere: 69
[10:00:43] wintersoldier2712: @Mr_Jhin4 Perfect sorted
[10:00:44] VenatusVox: Traffic light system
[10:00:45] Twin_Hallow: if you have small med and large daps ppl wont take it as serious
[10:00:45] DiscretionaI: Adopt the K.I.S.S principle
[10:00:46] confusedsensei: 420
[10:00:47] dawnxero: Agreed I like it
[10:00:50] Puk3s: Yup exactly
[10:00:54] MWRGaming: 20-40-60
[10:00:54] knowlightnofear: 20-40-60?
[10:00:54] FuZroK: 15 days for like paper work, hats etc
[10:00:57] bahubaker: 2 weeks for yall is a long time tho
[10:01:00] Rockshock: 20 40 60
[10:01:00] Beedle: vehicle strike system for officers NODDERS
[10:01:02] ShadowedSeraphim: well theres also the fact that with the 3 captains having to discuss takes time and people end up getting multiple sets up daps before knowing they have any
[10:01:02] uhSnow: @twin_hallow why/how
[10:01:10] WildWillie419: I feel like officers can’t track their DAPs as it is though
[10:01:11] Picklz: #nochanges ppl need to stop being negligent
[10:01:13] Artsii1994: lol
[10:01:20] ogspeacetv: LUL
[10:01:22] FuZroK: @Picklz tru
[10:01:24] godberd: the problem is dap stacking, one incident nails someone for 4-6. you can go from minor daps to being on that 10 line real quick
[10:01:30] Decimated_exo: i love mcnulty
[10:01:33] Puk3s: Now much you wanna get slacks does nothing
[10:01:39] Cultivated: A little too late to add that now no lol?>
[10:01:43] jessielight: yall do dap or focus on daps everyday.. more crime less friendly fire
[10:01:47] Rare__Potato: Just don't fuck up ICANT
[10:01:50] AlindBack: I'd suggest have Strikes as a lesser thing that drops off after 15, keep DAPs as they are. Strikes can be issued more freely, and can be elevated to review for becoming a DAP.
[10:01:58] manilovewakesfeet: collection of daps needs to be adjusted. dap stacking is a problem
[10:02:01] Twin_Hallow: @uhSnow I think having all these multiple versions mkaes it lose its meaning in a way
[10:02:09] Moobot: Thank you for subbing, wankejj! Welcome to the Saabscribers! saabH
[10:02:11] Puk3s: Lmao slacks doesn't know
[10:02:17] wankejj: wankejj subscribed with Prime. 
[10:02:18] manilovewakesfeet: just minimize dap stacking
[10:02:18] CeIoron: I agree, and then its officers out of commission for an hour too
[10:02:19] Twin_Hallow: thats what im saying
[10:02:19] TimmayHS: @ShadowedSeraphim yea they end up sitting in a report for a week+ waiting, one captain investigates, and the others just read mdt, which isn't always accurate
[10:02:19] Dyloc44: based
[10:02:20] JesusGVG: 30 minute class isnt simple?
[10:02:21] msdeell: true
[10:02:22] FuZroK: class only for like paper work type daps
[10:02:22] TraviiiOnTwitch: classes were brought up over a month ago and not one has happened
[10:02:23] Rare__Potato: I know how to make it simple, don't change it OMEGALAUGHING
[10:02:24] lookingfornothinghere: Dap / hours AINTNOWAY
[10:02:26] PepperAnn131: Listen to Flop
[10:02:26] MonsterFuel: NotLikeThis flop
[10:02:32] DiscretionaI: Keep it simple, stupid (KISS) is a design principle which states that designs and/or systems should be as simple as possible. Wherever possible, complexity should be avoided in a system—as simplicity guarantees the greatest levels of user acceptance and interaction.
[10:02:35] M3disyn: i mean as long as the classes happen.. i dont see the issue
[10:02:38] stellarnaut: FLOOOOOP
[10:02:43] MaSTerSOra701: theres like nothing that rewards for good behavior
[10:02:46] M3disyn: and its a teaching moment
[10:02:46] CeIoron: Flop is spitting
[10:02:48] urkuri92: not this LUL
[10:02:52] uhSnow: time on duty should hold 0 bearing over punishment LUL
[10:02:53] manilovewakesfeet: instead of one thing is 2 daps one is 1 dap etc, needs to fit the crime in a sense that the situation as a whole is looked at. not just a number for each dap
[10:02:53] JesusGVG: not this again OMEGALAUGHING
[10:02:53] Kizzlefoshizzle: I think  30/45 days and sometimes instead of a dap an officer does community service
[10:02:54] Rockshock: Bad idea
[10:02:54] MaSTerSOra701: Thats written
[10:02:56] MonsterFuel: this is a terrible idea
[10:02:58] TimmayHS: Turner: "Just don't get daps"
[10:03:05] xTurqeh: this is a cornwood idea for sure
[10:03:05] ShadowedSeraphim: @TimmayHS the person also get hit with them all at once which makes it seem like "DAP" stacking even if it isn't
[10:03:08] VenatusVox: Start cutting people's fingers off for infractions? lol
[10:03:09] ykicka: This is a Cornwood idea 😂
[10:03:09] lookingfornothinghere: too bad this isnt supported by data because there is no correlation KEKW
[10:03:15] urkuri92: you can tell who Flop talks to LUL
[10:03:17] Twin_Hallow: I agree with this guy i think
[10:03:17] MonsterFuel: does this take into account decreased effectiveness the more overtime an employee works?
[10:03:18] FuZroK: everyone trying to save Cornwood but he really shouldnt be a cop imo
[10:03:20] RealistReason: @uhSnow Agreed saabH
[10:03:22] Artsii1994: i think mixing a class and community services might do somehting but if you wanna keep it the same standards as it is then keep it as it is
[10:03:27] 0zarruu: i mean hours on duty would encourage people to go on duty, could be interesting
[10:03:29] TimmayHS: @ShadowedSeraphim right, and there's no teaching moment because it's ages ago in RP time
[10:03:29] Ned15: Time shouldn't matter at all
[10:03:35] MonsterFuel: @urkuri92 one of little fingers birdies christoHeart
[10:03:35] Jibry: nah I prefer Ruby's idea. DPH aaint it
[10:03:39] Decimated_exo: people would sit around just to increase time on duty or just go off pc leaving the character in on duty
[10:03:40] nickgmiller: all these complex senarios should be dealt with by captain discretion
[10:03:40] Artsii1994: time doesnt effect anything at all
[10:03:41] Genethebrave: I think its to a point that its beginning to be to serious to not be fun at all. RP fun, not real life...
[10:03:49] Ned15: A cop that does 40 a week does fine because they know their limits
[10:03:52] bahubaker: DISAGREE
[10:04:06] stellarnaut: flop is just trying to give more people a reason to go on duty
[10:04:07] jessielight: the way its done now, the dap system, has creatd a very unhealthy work environment and effects the confidence of the officers which leads to hesitancy
[10:04:08] Moobot: Thanks for subbing, quickwiiddit! Welcome to the Saabscribers! saabH
[10:04:09] godberd: every dap complaint has come from someone being told they have 4-6 Daps, for multiple problems but all hit at once
[10:04:13] stellarnaut: whats wrong with that?
[10:04:14] quickwiiddit: quickwiiddit subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! 
[10:04:14] M3disyn: turner based
[10:04:16] Puk3s: Telling you man this is the last
[10:04:18] lookingfornothinghere: mhm
[10:04:19] confusedsensei: Flop I think has a great point tbh
[10:04:26] Kizzlefoshizzle: Its good to see Turner back I missed his presence and opinions
[10:04:30] confusedsensei: make it like time based
[10:04:33] Artsii1994: like you could put in the hours but if you slip up it comes to what you made the mistake on not the hours you put into a shift
[10:04:56] scaredsquid: so is turner above slacks?
[10:04:57] zuze: this isnt going to fix anything lol
[10:04:59] Puk3s: Dude just shut up seems obvious
[10:05:07] TimmayHS: yea this is a terrible idea alone
[10:05:13] rclemon_: @Puk3s Bro you good?
[10:05:14] Artsii1994: like what will the classes be on
[10:05:18] M3disyn: duncan hasn't learned after 4 for professionalism LUL
[10:05:19] JesusGVG: not 1 dap OMEGALAUGHING
[10:05:20] ClipsBott: {Use ' !clip  [title] ' command to create a clip that is automatically sent to the #twitchclips channel on Discord ClappyHype }
[10:05:22] rclemon_: @Puk3s You drunk or something?
[10:05:30] bahubaker: its too complicated
[10:05:32] DiscretionaI: Just make officers write it down 1000 times. Example - I will not mag dump civilians (1000) times lol
[10:05:32] Puk3s: Of course
[10:05:33] Rockshock: More FTO work
[10:05:36] Kizzlefoshizzle: Cornwood should be the guineapig for a class if he is allowed back lol
[10:05:38] stellarnaut: @Artsii1994 i get that but hes trying to solve a realistic issue. Why shouldnt someone with a lot of daps just do minimum hours to avoid effing up?
[10:05:41] rclemon_: @Puk3s You ever been a sober viewer brother?
[10:05:42] bigbadwu: just hire tessa
[10:05:47] M3disyn: it's 10 percent of the force.. not 90 LUL
[10:05:47] 0zarruu: that will be hard to make work
[10:05:48] slendom: one way to massively demotivate your seniors
[10:05:48] uhSnow: she’s got a point, already can’t find FTOs koilPff
[10:05:58] TheyCallMeGeg: @Kizzlefoshizzle id pay to see him in class
[10:06:04] TimmayHS: 1 dap prevents you from getting suspended
[10:06:07] M3disyn: exactly LUL
[10:06:09] wintersoldier2712: @uhSnow Its okay snow you will be fto again soon
[10:06:09] zuze: they all start at 1
[10:06:10] Artsii1994: yea
[10:06:11] ogspeacetv: LULE
[10:06:13] urkuri92: Duncan shouldnt have talked back LUL
[10:06:14] Moobot: Thank you for subbing, McMillvn! Welcome to the Saabscribers! saabH
[10:06:15] FuZroK: its like 3 cops that have issues LUL
[10:06:28] Artsii1994: he goes around to talk to everyone and its gets yo a tiring point
[10:06:36] humanhere2: Actually agree with Turner here...
[10:06:37] EsfandTV: NotLikeThis it's too confusing
[10:06:38] Artsii1994: Duncaning
[10:06:39] JesusGVG: thats why one thing is 5 daps and the other is 1 LULW
[10:06:39] ShadowedSeraphim: yeah like that Bryan Knight guy  >.> lol
[10:06:40] EsfandTV: just make daps 20 days
[10:06:40] Puk3s: 😑
[10:06:43] slendom: how to say something without saying anything at all
[10:06:44] xXxEV0xXx: I think people should get daps for things they do that they know are wrong, or know they shouldnt be doing.. along thos lines. and not get ones because of an accident, or because something happens because they wernt or arnt trained fully or correctly.  Cause right now it seems like cops are gettin punished more then the crims. And some people are dap hungry/crazy.  Too busy trying to find the next person they can dap, then do other things.
[10:06:46] EsfandTV: why is this so complicated NotLikeThis
[10:06:47] lookingfornothinghere: yes thats why they dont ahve the same amount of DAP there is already a measurement
[10:06:51] jessielight: ROFL
[10:06:51] stellarnaut: @EsfandTV oh shit BIG C
[10:06:52] javibcardi: saabKEK
[10:06:52] rclemon_: 20 days NAAAAAAAAAAAH
[10:06:53] FuZroK: LUL
[10:06:53] EsfandTV: Copstacking DESKCHAN
[10:06:54] humanhere2: it's not an unfair system....
[10:06:54] Azzghan: LUL
[10:06:55] Rockshock: Just change minor moderate major to 20-40-60
[10:06:55] wintersoldier2712: Minor daps should be 30 days major 60
[10:06:55] TheyCallMeGeg: @EsfandTV LUL
[10:06:55] bahubaker: turners plan is way too complicated
[10:06:56] xTurqeh: just get rid of ALL Daps EZ
[10:06:58] McMillvn: I still feel like hours on duty needs to be taken into consideration. Someone with 4 DAPs in 100 hours and someone with 4 DAPs in 300 hours are vastly different but treated the same.
[10:06:59] DiscretionaI: nvm copy paste would be its flaw
[10:06:59] Rare__Potato: Just leave it how it is ICANT
[10:07:01] Artsii1994: esfand is like whyy is it this way
[10:07:02] RIPSO_: DESKCHAN
[10:07:02] Twin_Hallow: at the most 30 days id think
[10:07:03] WildWillie419: maybe no classes, just days lowered
[10:07:04] ogspeacetv: esfandCOPS esfandL @EsfandTV

[10:07:16] confusedsensei: esfandCOPS esfandCOPS esfandCOPS
[10:07:20] MaSTerSOra701: I think the minor-major system.
[10:07:23] hereforff9: Daps encourage people to not play
[10:07:24] SirCheezyyy: daps get handed out like candy. it should take more to recieve daps.
[10:07:26] CeIoron: Thats fair
[10:07:34] luckerooni: turner's system would work if it didn't require other people to come in and support it
[10:07:34] EsfandTV: DESKCHAN OMG THIS IS SO COMPLICATED I'M GONNA LOSE MY MIND LMAO
[10:07:35] M3disyn: where is the teaching moments though LUL
[10:07:40] wintersoldier2712: so turner is making the removal useless cause of his threshhold crap
[10:07:43] TimmayHS: 20/40/60 + classes or community service
[10:07:44] TraviiiOnTwitch: its just work ftos wont want to do
[10:07:46] Kizzlefoshizzle: @EsfandTV THIS
[10:07:48] JesusGVG: 20 for minor means you can pretty much do minor DAPs every other day LULW
[10:07:48] javibcardi: saabKEK

[10:08:05] autorocket: esfandYou esfandAre esfandDead
[10:08:06] manilovewakesfeet: ESFAND LURKIN
[10:08:07] Puk3s: So what is your point
[10:08:11] uhSnow: I think daps are the classes themselves, adding a whole other process seems too much
[10:08:21] SirCheezyyy: and there should be a more of a guideline as far as how many daps a punishment gets CLEAR SET STANDARDS.
[10:08:22] MaSTerSOra701: why would i want to take a class
[10:08:23] ShadowedSeraphim: Hes just trying to buy his way back into the PD @ssaab j/k
[10:08:27] quickwiiddit: gotta scale like a college classroom
[10:08:30] Kizzlefoshizzle: @EsfandTV we're keen to see Cornwood in class to remove daps CORNMAN
[10:08:31] MWRGaming: why not ridealong
[10:08:33] Rockshock: FTO's already getting burnt out. So ye
[10:08:35] nickgmiller: the classes are a huge burden to put on FTO/seniors
[10:08:36] fraudiola9: lete evryon YAPP and be everyone be negative LULW
[10:08:36] Artsii1994: true it is a lot of planning
[10:08:39] MaSTerSOra701: taking a class feels kind of kimiSleep
[10:08:41] Gygosan: 20 40 60
[10:08:41] MothyNZ: Just make it 60 hours on duty
[10:08:42] uhSnow: when pd is bigger that system will work
[10:08:42] TimmayHS: @ogspeacetv No amount of SBS is acceptable Madge /s
[10:08:43] luckerooni: yea it's so crazy to expect someone to just be the "dap class person" when there's so many jobs falling through the cracks already
[10:08:44] xTurqeh: take this class on what shoes to wear
[10:08:44] brittandavis: @EsfandTV do you like the new paladin relics
[10:08:45] Decimated_exo: scheduling will be ass yes
[10:08:47] DiscretionaI: Postpone
[10:08:50] spacelindsay2: plus you’d make an fto come up with a 30 min class on a random subject who would even offer themselves to do that
[10:08:51] StreamElements: Rules: 1. Please respect everyone in chat. 2. Don't complain about timeouts or bans. 3. Don't shit talk other streamers. 4. No metagaming or backseatgaming

[10:08:55] Puk3s: I'm pretty sure everyone besides eafand are more happy with him
[10:08:56] RealistReason: @uhSnow Yeah I think it's a nice idea in theory but a lot more work that could be used elsewhere.
[10:08:57] focustft: Lowering the number of days is easy and can be implemented right away
[10:09:02] ogspeacetv: @TimmayHS Sadge okay moon2L
[10:09:03] lookingfornothinghere: i was hoping for sexy teacher Slacks uuh
[10:09:11] rclemon_: 30/60
[10:09:16] uhSnow: minor major whatever seems like a good change
[10:09:16] skympii: base the fall out of how much hours people put in during duty so you see more cops logged in
[10:09:17] Ikilledkenny91: Cornwood gonna lose it
[10:09:20] stellarnaut: "its the same people" and its getting around to the snrs even if its only a few people getting dapped. Every officer is putting themselves in the shoes of the dapped
[10:09:26] ogspeacetv: peepoGiggle
[10:09:28] dreggy69: ruby is the goat man
[10:09:28] stellarnaut: RUBYYY
[10:09:37] MWRGaming: 30/60 is fine too to be honest
[10:09:41] SirCheezyyy: this dap system and the way they get handed out have officers more scared to do there job then anything.
[10:09:42] scaredsquid: ruby saabH saabH
[10:09:46] Twin_Hallow: I see why daps are needed but also seems it could stop fun silly shit in rp

[10:09:54] MWRGaming: Or pit
[10:09:57] Kizzlefoshizzle: Ruby is right

[10:10:02] spacelindsay2: that’s my Sgt York right there
[10:10:04] jollypnda: if your altering your job because your afraid of being punished then your most likely not doing the right things to begin with

[10:10:07] MaSTerSOra701: Ruby is a good leader
[10:10:09] 0zarruu: based Ruby

[10:10:14] stellarnaut: @FuZroK i disagree i think officers are empathizing
[10:10:15] TimmayHS: We need some kind of union KEKW
[10:10:15] talamah: DAPs fall off in 5d10 days
[10:10:17] Rockshock: Speak up @Ssaab Dont think they heard your idea lol
[10:10:18] Jibry: @uhSnow yeah in SOPs the Daps are already labeled minor moderate and major so its easy to implement
[10:10:20] MonsterFuel: @Puk3s cry
[10:10:30] wintersoldier2712: No turner. Yall keep pushing daps on people for so much that they are scared to loose hours or years of a cop char
[10:10:39] Puk3s: Huh
[10:10:43] msdeell: solutions
[10:10:45] Artsii1994: ruby sees the picture of things from her point of view. its good to hear what she thinks
[10:10:51] FuZroK: @stellarnaut They are for sure, but the officers spreading negative energy are not helping
[10:10:52] jessielight: because how the daps are done now causes them to see a lack of faith in leadership for the subordinates which makes them trust themselves less too
[10:10:52] Decimated_exo: classes are hard
[10:10:52] stellarnaut: officers are asking themselves could this easily happen to me? Like with the johnson pit
[10:10:55] Decimated_exo: xiceDog
[10:10:59] fraudiola9: @wintersoldier2712 no ones telling people to do 16 hour

[10:11:23] Rare__Potato: What officers though? OMEGALAUGHING who is complaining about the DAPs?
[10:11:24] fraudiola9: because cornwood is all they talk about
[10:11:24] spoonsnforks: They see themselves in Cornwood/Den/Aziz.
[10:11:25] talamah: @Rumred FINALLY SOMEONE SAID IT Clap
[10:11:26] wintersoldier2712: @fraudiola9 They need to cauise no cops. And the cpts dap so much for minor shit
[10:11:27] Eddie1225: hes the most evil one
[10:11:28] Eddie1225: OMEGALAUGHING
[10:11:28] PepperAnn131: Combine it with academy? Then you don't need to organize an extra new class.
[10:11:28] SirCheezyyy: @Jibry thats a good point! 1 dap for miner 2 daps for moderate and 3 for major offiences set a limit on it. not just whatever certain people feel like.
[10:11:32] buddha_hands: people broadcasting doom all the time is a form of insubordination in itself as it undermines CoC & wastes time LUL

[10:11:49] a_robles01: 20/40/60 then community service instead of classes open RP for everyone would be creative

[10:12:24] VenatusVox: Scrap the daps, do 3 written warnings and one final lol

[11:03:37] GYNECHIATRIST: yeah because the mayor's good at politicking. it's not a strong mayor system in place, he still has to convince council to pass legislation.

[11:05:00] GYNECHIATRIST: so this is the other side of the council PepeLaugh
[11:05:01] quickwiiddit: 20min in prison for impeachment

[11:06:20] Kizzlefoshizzle: @ShadowedSeraphim Yeah of course, but the mayor would take that a step forward to try consolidate power in Lil Texas and Cornwood would be willing to do it

[11:19:31] RobialT: They dont ened to steal the vehicle
[11:19:33] Eddie1225: lmao
[11:19:33] Firehead94: VIN number could be attached on the first vehicle it enters and then can be re-vin'd at the PD

[14:01:55] Sanitet: OMEGALAUGHING to be fair dab just united the captains more than ever

[14:04:37] 1Tesla1: To be fair the captains have followed the rules they have been given very well. They just have to realize they are there for just that. And if they get handed new rules to follow they have to do that just as well.
[14:04:46] theredfrosts: Can the mayor form some type of militia or something to arrest the pd?

[14:06:03] IIIIHELLIIII: The mayor could just create a whole new PD  kekw
[14:06:05] GlitchyGunZ: I think it’s definitely not some master Cornwood arc I think that’s speculation of someone who’s afraid of that for good reasons lol this feels bigger than C
[14:06:06] Hibob222: quick by me a pc so i can applier to nopixel and become a cop
[14:06:11] Kaiyo_exe: @Ssaab Do you think that this is now an OOC Content RP vs Realism RP issue

[14:06:36] FetchLong: yes and Cornwood cannot fit into such a PD
[14:06:39] Hibob222: i watch lots of cops and dont see much rule breaking if any

[14:06:58] JesusGVG: i mean he was already disrespectful before the 3 months comment
[14:06:58] Laticore: its just semantics, he would have assigned his own time frame no matter what was said
[14:06:59] GlitchyGunZ: @alkemiee you get a good glimpse of what their intentions or what they do when you watch them a lot. it’s not rocket science
[14:07:00] Hibob222: p rp is the best
[14:07:05] Ned15: @nova__cannon  yes but shift 3 always had retention issues

[14:10:35] GlitchyGunZ: @condor2104 wasn’t he invited there though
[14:10:36] xXxEV0xXx: @Ned15 He didnt say that tho... he said the counsel could impeach him at anytime. He was saying that the captians didnt have anyone above them.. and that they were their own Judge,Jury, and Executioners. And just wanted someone for them to look up too, and that person didnt need to be him.

[14:15:51] GYNECHIATRIST: with council's approval
[14:16:01] Twin_Hallow: im confused on how being the mayor works in gta rp lol
[14:16:07] Nova__Cannon: If not the mayor though then who - its just that if every mayor comes along and the PD doesnt like the mayor then does this implosion arc just get put on repeat?
[14:16:09] RealistReason: Thank god the mayor is doing other important things, like turning months into minutes Kappa
[14:16:12] Ned15: @smbsocal  by opening the sheriff's office?
[14:16:15] clowniusthe1st: lol
[14:16:16] Artsii1994: @Twin_Hallow 3 months
[14:16:17] FetchLong: @smbsocal Cornwood has done nothing but constantly undermine the Captains and he PD as a whole. It's because he is mad he can't get special treatment
[14:16:17] Kaiyo_exe: I think the mayor's issue is that if the captains wanted to coverup anything there's nothing in place to stop them from doing so. It's completely tyranny in his eyes probably
[14:16:22] PepperAnn131: Have they informed Etta about how this meeting went?
[14:16:24] FuZroK: @smbsocal the way the captains acted? LUL
[14:16:29] GYNECHIATRIST: @Twin_Hallow weak mayor system. mayor is just one vote in council, which functions as an executive-legislative branch of government.

[14:17:06] Nova__Cannon: In fairness if your chief of staff and you are not inline with your thought process- it would be a very unhealthy working rleationship
[14:17:06] fraudiola9: @Kaiyo_exe but why does he care about that when nothing like that has happened and their are ooc rules for that
[14:17:06] theredfrosts: I think if you were sheriffs you would not be under him. but city pd I think is under him.

[14:18:43] KingIAm: These captains shouldn't have control of the PD it's not a captains job
[14:18:43] GYNECHIATRIST: isn't it the liaison's duty to keep the mayor abreast of PD affairs?
[14:18:43] GlitchyGunZ: lmao Ramee would eliminate half pd the first day. not good lol
[14:18:43] Kaiyo_exe: @fraudiola9 The sentiment passed on to him from various PD members and from external sources have all pointed towards the captains especially R u t h being tyrannical
[14:18:52] Jibry: Slacks just wants to be a detective saabStare
[14:18:55] Ned15: @seraphbutterfly that can happen without him having power

[14:19:58] GlitchyGunZ: a chief would obviously be voted and have to be able to do the job. right ? @ssaab
[14:20:00] Stackswyd: @ned15 favorite chatter saabWave
[14:20:04] SeraphButterfly: @Ned15 That in itself is the problem, because he wants to avoid the PD doing everything internally. He wants there to be accountability *outside* of the PD.
[14:20:10] MrSpiny: vote is ~12hrs away

[14:20:35] felinegurl: wasn't that the idea?
[14:20:36] Hibob222: the chief does work for the mayor but the chief will always have the last say

[14:21:08] theredfrosts: @gygosan same
[14:21:11] xTurqeh: Commissioner Soze
[14:21:11] FetchLong: @Decimated_exo shit IS tasty...for FLIES! The audience decides if a (role) play is good.
[14:21:23] Hibob222: he wants to be the guy at the top
[14:21:30] theredfrosts: this is like a great drama series I’m binge watching.
[14:21:33] chauzus: he thinks you guys dont want oversight
[14:21:34] GlitchyGunZ: I’m sure a lot of good candidates will apply @ssaab

[14:22:10] FetchLong: @clowniusthe1st Okay master, I will do what you tell me!
[14:22:11] GlitchyGunZ: From what I heard they are not trying to choose the guy, from what I heard it’s supposed to be a vote for them
[14:22:21] GYNECHIATRIST: Sure
[14:22:37] Decimated_exo: @fetchlong then it will be “reddit is right and should control rp” absolute degeneracy
[14:22:46] shamison1: yes nova!!! this exactly do they just overthrow the next mayor because pd don’t like him? they are legit doing what they are crying about the mayor doing lol
[14:22:48] udigggg: Kappa

[14:23:01] Hibob222: 14 hours into stream my cat finally sits in my lap  saabSip
[14:23:03] KingIAm: PD wants state funds. Mayor rules the state. Won't follow mayor direction equals failed PD

[14:23:28] Twin_Hallow: seems they are scared of him doing what he is saying they are doing
[14:23:34] GlitchyGunZ: I think slacks  got the level head and should talk  to mayor 1v1 get him to see eye to eye @ssaab
[14:23:35] theredfrosts: @fraudiola9 thanks.

[14:25:54] GlitchyGunZ: man starting Monday it’s gonna be wild for NP as a whole
[14:25:54] Decimated_exo: @fetchlong pestering to audience and quality of rp are not always in line, just saying. some people hold the audience and viewers just by doing outrage stuff to get “clicks”
[14:26:06] Rare__Potato: Damn, if only PD had Malton to write up an announcement SadgeCry
[14:26:14] theredfrosts: Wait before a civ can buy a gun he has to register it with the PD right? So you guys could control the flow no?
[14:26:19] GlitchyGunZ: I feel like her character is really worried about losing her powers LUL LUL LUL
[14:26:24] GlitchyGunZ: that’s her main concern

[14:26:40] Eddie1225: yea yall make ruth a villan
[14:26:42] FuZroK: @theredfrosts they should require DNA for gun registration LUL

[14:27:07] MaSTerSOra701: sicne Slacks is just a boy
[14:27:09] KingIAm: I think only cops have to register their guns with PD
[14:27:11] Eddie1225: @MaSTerSOra701 yea i know
[14:27:13] SojuBorealist: Theyre just doing their job and wanting the best for the city
[14:27:15] GlitchyGunZ: yes not the streamer

[14:27:19] Eddie1225: PepeLaugh
[14:27:22] NemoBlu: glad someone is streaming this pov
[14:27:30] Kaiyo_exe: @Ssaab I think you're misunderstanding some of us are talking about her character and not the person OOC
[14:27:32] theredfrosts: same
[14:27:37] MaSTerSOra701: all the youtube clips tomorrow
[14:27:39] MaSTerSOra701: KEKW
[14:27:43] Twin_Hallow: what @Kaiyo_exe said
[14:27:51] StreamElements: Please do not meta in chat, which means do not tell Saab stuff happening in RP that his character would otherwise not know.
[14:27:58] santa_c7: santa_c7 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 1 month streak! saabWave <3
[14:28:04] KaycasTV: i thought ssaab was going to bed like an hour ago when he said goodbye to turner moon2LOLE
[14:28:08] GlitchyGunZ: I don’t got a horse in the race here and idc. I’m watching a lot of streams and I hear that character name mentioned a lot in distaste within PD and crims..not ooc just character
[14:28:09] Wrighty: I don't understand RP
[14:28:10] Twin_Hallow: they were talking about her character pretty surew
[14:28:10] xDopeTalentz: you can’t reason with people who believe that lmao
[14:28:11] FetchLong: @Decimated_exo yea, fair point. And you should not do that, but in the end the audience will still decide if RP is good....most of the time on other servers the audience is just the RPer and the characters and players involved tho. If you are only RPing for your own entertainment then the purpose of RPing with others is lost.
[14:28:11] Sulton_: If they want a real PD villain make Eddie a cpt LUL
[14:28:17] GYNECHIATRIST: the character portrayal is intentional PepeLaugh
[14:28:17] SaRAWRuby: u don’t say
[14:28:20] xTurqeh: do we think the city council meeting ends before tsunami
[14:28:26] shamison1: I feel like for wood is getting bad end of the stick here…. everyone thinks he went and snitched to the mayor because he got suspended and he didn’t…
[14:28:31] GlitchyGunZ: from within the game not ooc
[14:28:42] Nova__Cannon: HUH
[14:28:43] KingIAm: @ssaab and yeah, we are just discussing our points of view just like you are in your RP
[14:28:57] Eddie1225: saab is just saying that in general
[14:29:03] Eddie1225: about the ruth cheever thing
[14:29:03] theredfrosts: @shamison1 I think molten is the snitch. In my opinion
[14:29:05] Nova__Cannon: I mean it would be 2 extra rows in an excel spreadsheet heh
[14:29:07] Decimated_exo: @fetchlong in perfect world you only rp and care for the people you rp with :)
[14:29:11] Eddie1225: cuz some people are actually insane
[14:29:13] theredfrosts: why is she saying no to this?
[14:29:15] Eddie1225: lol
[14:29:21] Chengaling: saabSuffer
[14:29:25] FetchLong: @shamison1 yeah well because that is what it seems like IC for everyone. Can't act differently to that
[14:29:27] GlitchyGunZ: @twin_hallow correct. I haven’t said anything about what is aid of opinions of ooc just from pure roleplay characters opinions
[14:29:30] CMF_LOONEYTOON: The RP is FLowing to the point of 86 Her cuz  she can't handle the truth and bring back Corny IMO Dealed and Sealed
[14:29:32] Twin_Hallow: thats what I was saying I feel like ppl mix up chatters talking about the character and not the strimmer
[14:29:35] KingIAm: Honestly, if we didn't rant etc their would be no chat lol
[14:29:43] shamison1: @theredfrosts yeah I mean corn wood legit defended the captains to the mayor and turner thinks he’s the one going and complaining
[14:29:49] xTurqeh: oh?
[14:29:51] FetchLong: @Decimated_exo true! And I agree that the audience part is likely taken to an extreme on a streaming server
[14:29:53] GYNECHIATRIST: @Eddie1225 i attribute it to overinvestment as opposed to malice. this is good RP.
[14:29:56] MaSTerSOra701: OOH thats progress
[14:29:59] xTurqeh: lowercase w
[14:30:13] Eddie1225: @GYNECHIATRIST oh yea there is that sure

[14:30:36] Eddie1225: literally *
[14:30:38] Kaiyo_exe: I missed the last 2 mins
[14:30:42] GlitchyGunZ: @twin_hallow correct. that’s why I try to be specific and use keyword character
[14:30:57] GlitchyGunZ: @eddie1225 those are psychos
[14:31:06] dommeka: “thinking about it” is no progress.
[14:31:19] shamison1: slacks defend our boy cornwood! he didn’t snitch to the mayor
[14:31:20] theredfrosts: @shamison1 Yeah exactly. I don’t think Big C ever wants to hurt the PD and never would. that’s why I know it’s molten.
[14:31:28] SojuBorealist: Daps for you and everyone GIGACHAD
[14:31:36] KingIAm: RP skitzos are amazing. Need more
[14:31:37] GlitchyGunZ: anyone who gets mad at people ooc got major issues personally

[14:55:13] crescenterra: LUL
[14:55:22] GlitchyGunZ: @pichoto I think it needs to be articulated he won’t use the chief as a puppet that’s the concern I think?
[14:55:30] Pichoto: @Ned15 Yes, but it should be selected by him and the other caps, dont you think?
[14:55:32] Eddie1225: they said they will have a chief

[14:55:52] Twin_Hallow: like he will use that power to be corrupts
[14:55:57] Decimated_exo: @pichoto and concern is that he puts anyone who he wants, being his puppet
[14:55:58] jersey_jesus: Oh noooo
[14:55:58] Ned15: @Pichoto the issue is that Max wants power over the Chief
[14:56:20] Szonin: CAUGHT no way shift 3 is dead

[15:22:01] MaSTerSOra701: What she said "It does fit"
[15:22:05] shamison1: she 100% made another comment he heard
[15:22:06] MaSTerSOra701: but its a stretch
[15:22:12] chauzus: its more like insubordination
[15:22:14] SarahFlare: she said it was a joke in character. but now it’s not? not trying to be combative but that’s a huge change.
[15:22:15] Custard02: yeah it doesn’t fit
[15:22:17] Twin_Hallow: I mean they could fight that if they wanted to
[15:22:17] shamison1: he isn’t talking about the first one
[15:22:18] Pichoto: but she put out the idea hahahaha xDDD
[15:22:21] JakeStratic: and/or
[15:22:22] PepperAnn131: Wait, 0 months and 0 dollars for treason? Who cares then?! :D
[15:22:25] Twin_Hallow: would be hard tho
[15:22:27] Canachos: i think staying quiet could imply that?
[15:22:28] humanhere2: No, the mayor was just being reactionary...
[15:22:30] Nova__Cannon: inciting its direct to a person and people dont need to agree - inciting is planting the seed
[15:22:31] Ned15: Then he is doing it as well because he wants power over the PD LuL
[15:22:32] djhyzel78: I think maybe he felt it was very condescending
[15:22:36] FetchLong: hehehe LUL
[15:22:38] MacL0ven: I mean in the stairwell she kind of did....she said im just not going to listen to their ruling
[15:22:38] Badass_Hobo: @PepperAnn131 Its a HUT charge you get the 9's until trial
[15:22:42] theredfrosts: That’s not even treason
[15:22:42] ogspeacetv: the 0 $ fine is crazy... so that would imply anyone can do treason
[15:22:44] Eddie1225: crane saabDink
[15:22:48] Twin_Hallow: he is making a vote so thats not treasons
[15:22:49] fraudiola9: let him try ,hes doing the same lol

[15:23:05] udigggg: 
[15:23:05] KingIAm: 311 not wrong though
[15:23:09] Eddie1225: or i will see that your all accountable is wild OMEGALAUGHING
[15:23:12] Ned15: The Captains job is to discuss issues LuL
[15:23:14] shamison1: turner did say going down the stairs we need to get him impeached, is that treason?
[15:23:15] shadowpuma23: Cheever is so good at playing the heel she's great
[15:23:17] VladVolynine: All it took was one sentence from her to ruin the rep KEKW
[15:23:22] xTurqeh: shit, might as well meet with Simone now too

[15:23:46] theredfrosts: saying you want to vote for him to be removed it would not even be treason.
[15:23:48] Switchblade142: I don't think she did but people are goofy and might see it that way if it gets out to the public
[15:23:48] SojuBorealist: And patrolling
[15:23:50] PepperAnn131: Hope they can get a hold of Etta. She has sway in the council.
[15:23:50] KingIAm: It's like the circle of life but it's a circle of backstabbing

[15:24:06] itWyrm: Thats what it takes for yall to listen it seems LULW
[15:24:07] dudemanbroo: FREEDOM
[15:24:07] shamison1: I think max is taking about a comment you didn’t hear after the first one she mumbled something and he heard it
[15:24:09] MaSTerSOra701: I was more like "3 month" statement
[15:24:11] NemoBlu: da-gum shitshow
[15:24:11] Badass_Hobo: The problem is she said that in front of a super lawyer who dissects everything
[15:24:12] MaSTerSOra701: was more oof
[15:24:15] ixidakonixi: Maybe Sonya summers wasn't so crazy
[15:24:16] shamison1: she turned to turner and whispered it
[15:24:17] Krimson07_: malton clears
[15:24:17] HagFaerie: Brilliant RP
[15:24:19] enrise311: its all about intent ad how people interpret it. optics are bad eitherway
[15:24:19] shadowpuma23: Today has been so entertaining to watch. So much big stuff happened
[15:24:20] SeraphButterfly: To be honest, Turner's attempts to calm Max sounded more like being condescending and treating him like a child. So that might have also rubbed Max the wrong way.
[15:24:21] carnerr: From what I heard, it sounded like a treasonous statement. But either way love the RP

[15:24:29] SojuBorealist: Yeah
[15:24:29] Nova__Cannon: If the comments were written in black and white then left for interpretation though thats were it gets concerning
[15:24:31] dudemanbroo: it’s a veiled threat
[15:24:32] Canachos: ask for air 1
[15:24:36] JesusGVG: @SeraphButterfly act like a child get treated like one LULW
[15:24:37] TraviiiOnTwitch: it was the other statement that was rough
[15:24:37] theredfrosts: deem him unfit to carry a gun
[15:24:38] MaSTerSOra701: Still waiting on the 1911 PD
[15:24:42] RevethyTV: yes, there isn’t a lot of fun to it now
[15:24:43] lookingfornothinghere: PD literally doesnt even have a bike
[15:24:51] CaliRpMikeO: what chair are you sitting in for 15 hours bro? lol
[15:24:54] KingIAm: He wants to sleep, bit he needs to help sort PD

[15:24:56] whack1000: whack1000 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months! 
[15:24:59] SeraphButterfly: @JesusGVG True, but not when you're speaking to the mayor and trying to win favor with him. It didn't help their case.
[15:25:03] Ned15: I mean you started with barely anything
[15:25:05] khlaah: Dapping for nonserious shit needs to go away, ASAP, because it's childish daps. imo
[15:25:05] nebxhelix: The mayors wife is the common denominator ... ear whispers
[15:25:11] MacL0ven: I think the DAP system isnt a very good one the more i see it in action
[15:25:15] Ned15: You just got the evidence system not long ago
[15:25:22] Twin_Hallow: how did they use to stop ppl on bikes?
[15:25:25] shamison1: not sure if you saw slacks but I think max is going off on the comment she turned to turner and whispered, that he heard he isn’t talking about what she thinks he is
[15:25:31] srheinholtz: Crim side is so fleshed out already and PD is just getting new cars
[15:25:31] Pichoto: that is not how she said it LOL INTEGRITY hahahahaha
[15:25:31] Decimated_exo: Aziz is going for it in 3 2 1
[15:25:33] Decimated_exo: KEKW
[15:25:33] JesusGVG: @SeraphButterfly true but tbf they werent trying to win favor i think
[15:25:34] fraudiola9: aziz needs to do this LULW
[15:25:35] enrise311: optics look bad eitherway

[15:25:37] throat_pump: Lenny coming in for Ruth’s arrest? lol Kappa
[15:25:40] Nova__Cannon: There was one other comment prior to leaving the room though too
[15:25:42] NemoBlu: problems keep piling up
[15:25:46] MaSTerSOra701: Could you imagine if this is how she goes down? Would be a way to go..
[15:25:47] theredfrosts: she posed a hypothetical question
[15:25:51] Badass_Hobo: Thats just gonna make people scared, and not say anything for fear of retaliation. thats literately a bait post
[15:25:51] smbsocal: The officer who showed Max around earlier was squirrely and      Max asked why he was acting that way and he said due to the DAPs.
[15:25:51] itWyrm: no ill will surely Kapp
[15:25:53] Jeffro9877: Lenny follows it up !
[15:25:57] TraviiiOnTwitch: i dont think slacks heard the 2nd comment
[15:26:01] khlaah: you lost 2 officers who are good on the streets, to some nonsense ass shit, that they could have been retrained instead of fired/dap'd for. imo.
[15:26:06] Laticore: The chatters who meditate on their rp mountains coming in hot to give their hot takes FeelsStrongMan
[15:26:08] condor2104: Cletus got dap for a joke
[15:26:11] shamison1: @nova__cannon yes that’s the one max is complaining about but slacks didn’t hear it
[15:26:12] brvtyy: not the first time pd was led by a terrorist right
[15:26:14] Ned15: @smbsocal so is there accountability or not LuL
[15:26:15] RealistReason: Max lost it at people for not voting along with his months to minutes stuff, guy just doesnt like hearing no LUL
[15:26:17] sshineysean: she literally accused max of treason first, and explicitly said (in front of slack and turner on the way out) that she wouldn’t enforce this if passed …
[15:26:18] Amazing_Andyy: LOL Everyone is after Brooke this days...
[15:26:20] SeraphButterfly: I'd say they were. They were trying to convince Max that things are progressing, and trying to give him insight, but they went in with one idea in mind and were just as stubborn as Max.
[15:26:20] BobFromAccounts: Chat when did the captains meet with the mayor? after the K arrest?
[15:26:24] Muempire0: cum
[15:26:25] Nova__Cannon: @shamison1 Ohhhh MB didnt mean to meta assumed he heard it
[15:26:26] Aptii_: @Laticore honestly slacks should get a fade tbh look at his cheese looking head
[15:26:38] shamison1: yeah she whispered it to turner and max heard it
[15:26:41] throat_pump: she did on the way out but not in front of the mayor
[15:26:42] fraudiola9: Where are the mayoral checks and balanced now LULW
[15:26:43] KingIAm: @bobfromaccounts yes
[15:26:44] SojuBorealist: Honestly resurrect baas Prayge
[15:26:45] shamison1: but slacks didn’t hear
[15:26:46] Mouso9: You guys later said if they take control you wouldn't enforce it.     Not in the office but on the walk out
[15:26:49] xTurqeh: Muempire0 BASED
[15:26:54] TraviiiOnTwitch: @throat_pump max heard it
[15:26:55] khlaah: other than the stupid childish/nonserious daps, i feel the captains have done well.
[15:26:55] Laticore: @Aptii_ yellow cabbage head looking aah
[15:26:57] BobFromAccounts: Thanks @kingiam
[15:26:58] Decimated_exo: so much points spent Pog
[15:27:03] Ned15: They don't even have an answer from the Feds yet right?
[15:27:07] espeiranza: police is not government
[15:27:13] Twin_Hallow: @Mouso9 if he heard that it would def be bad
[15:27:14] dudemanbroo: omg pd is not 😂
[15:27:15] Decimated_exo: wasting 10k on that when you can ban eddie 10 times
[15:27:16] theredfrosts: say hypothetical in the announcement
[15:27:20] Ned15: Malton just said they are waiting for an answer from Crane

[15:27:46] Ned15: PepeLaugh
[15:27:49] GYNECHIATRIST: @espeiranza yeah apparently PD is executive, but answers to mayor/council (legislative branch) for as long as there's no chief of police.
[15:27:49] MaSTerSOra701: Police is part of the Executive Branch
[15:27:51] StreamElements: Please do not meta in chat, which means do not tell Saab stuff happening in RP that his character would otherwise not know.
[15:27:54] MaSTerSOra701: they enforce the laws
[15:27:58] Janman88: purely from the outside: R uth rocked the boat and now things come back down - crazy good RP <3
[15:28:01] fraudiola9: Let the mayor try , more checks and balancer are coming for them lol

[15:28:09] xTurqeh: is your cat still in your lap
[15:28:12] espeiranza: poloce is the tool for government
[15:28:13] CopperKat: Her saying that the Captains shouldn't enforce the legislation if enacted is technically inciting you two to participate...
[15:28:13] condor2104: the president controls the armed forces and he is a civilian
[15:28:15] Pichoto: that report is pointless, you three dont have a superior office to report to, so you three are your own judge and executioner

[15:51:40] Ned15: @sokjuice they want the civilian board to do it and the DOJ already told cops they can go to them
[15:51:51] Decimated_exo: @sokjuice it is hard not to have it if Mayor fires someone who disagrees with him on this exact question and has a vote, then places his wife on that spot

[15:52:34] Dagrre: It's also a lie
[15:52:36] throat_pump: it’s gonna be pretty crazy tomorrow. max will probably tell the citizens who’ve been getting robbed that he wants a commissioner to come in to look over the pd’s work and the captains are going to say they don’t need one
[15:52:38] wahmbulance: Hell week is gonna be fun rameeHandsUp
