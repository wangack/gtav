[2:19:09] Rahjoth: Yeah. You can change it up! You can go down that path and be a  spymaster controlling shadows, or you can switch out! Mickey seemed real open to helping people do what they want, even if that means changing roles or titles. Plus, Swan do what she WANTS! crystCool
[2:20:23] bubbaduva: Maybe a dated reference so people won't immediately catch on
[2:20:26] Daelaron86: nice
[2:20:31] Zombiesweat: I like it
[2:20:41] Rahjoth: @bubbaduva I think people would be curious and look it up...
