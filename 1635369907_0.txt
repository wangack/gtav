[5:18:45] ASomewhatLargeBabyRhino: Honestly, the gym buffs would explain why everyone suddenly got washboard abs KEKW
[5:18:48] Crankster42: Gym membership buff would ACTUALLY be a money printer. It would be like rings LUL
[5:18:51] venkaramon: does he want buffs? maybe he just wants the animations
[5:18:52] RoyalJZX: I can see it being useful to go to the gym before a job to carry more weight or something
[5:18:55] Maithiss: buffing running, jumping, punching, and carry weight would be cool
[5:19:04] nicstoria: the Dojo mechanics not getting done messed up the RP with Gary and CG
[5:19:04] 9erwyn: if you buff something like their melee damage, it would be ok since its niche and not really OP against cop etc.
[5:19:06] NoodleDays: Baas won’t use this
[5:19:07] ceruleansatyr: If they make it take double the time outside of prison it would make it so crims would rather use the better resource
