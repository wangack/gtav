[2:36:34] Titan911: I was only nine years old. I loved Lysium so much, I had all the merchandise and sponsor merch. I'd pray to Lysium every night before I go to bed, thanking for the life I've been given. "Lysium is love", I would say, "Lysium is life". My dad hears me and calls me a redditor. I knew he was just jealous for my devotion of Lysium. I called him a Juicer. He slaps me and sends me to go to sleep. I'm crying now and my face hurts

[4:08:38] Remorse45: so basically the company slowly turning into a syndicate?
[4:08:38] VainthVR: Yup
[4:08:39] mugsby23: This legislation just killed the company vision
[4:08:40] superduperflapjack: Yeah it definitely feels like you're just a gang now like everyone else
[4:08:41] TropicalToucan: I think it really depends on how Cops actually investigate financials. Until cops start looking into how you make money
[4:08:41] tyannaparks: So company is doomed
[4:08:42] foreverbound9: ok go be a gang then
[4:08:42] noctis_crescent: ye 󠀀
[4:08:42] CURT_iS: the company = sinclaire industries & CG (company gang)
[4:08:45] Mundosaysyourfired: so this is more about you ott and ray
[4:08:45] MAB09x: Don't think too much, you'll need inputs from Ray and OTT too to get a good final understanding
[4:08:45] magedufker: O ta ta can
[4:08:45] GustSauros: The legislation killed the Company
[4:08:45] TwinEyeDestiiny: Not all companies are "legal"
[4:08:46] nearbymethdealer: would the new wave of interns bring back that feeling?

[4:09:34] pierrot9998: just change the name, so it wont conflict
[4:09:34] wOnG_ManDoO: Put that in the Note
[4:09:35] el_gato_64: @Lysium i understand it mate. translating all of this to mickey and ott will be tough.  if you can keep company and sinclaire corp separate, it works. if it doesn't, company will be cg 2.0
[4:09:35] stupidobox: the legislation has been there for weeks though
[4:09:36] zxxuk: your only seeing your pov not ott or mixkey
[4:09:36] VallarFax_: @Lysium on paper, yeah you are right but you are still a board member in spirit right like a 4 headed monster. you are thinking too far ahead with no other members online and the laws can change when a new mayor gets in
[4:09:37] magsyy123: thats assuming all the people can't fake it

[4:09:41] kmac097: as a roleplayer thats a funny statement
[4:09:42] trucrugame: Time for a new vision
[4:09:42] Mundosaysyourfired: so you're rebranding into a gang
[4:09:43] TaySands: lysYes
[4:09:43] j9ko9: the template is gone
[4:09:44] agestone: SCHIZO
[4:09:45] hellenaq: Oh
[4:09:45] detoksi: maybe the problem is because your called the company and not something else?
[4:09:45] theking4x4: just do what mickey does

[4:09:55] Jgurl2u: noooo not a gang
[4:09:55] zakataha8: company warehouse - > every company members can interact. leave notes and build bonds between all branches (business/pharma etc). IMO miss-communications and distance between members will kill the company.
