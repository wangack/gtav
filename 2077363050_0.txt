[0:18:38] mostly_minerals: Is the house all kitchen?

[0:18:42] Bowerbird7: don't like where that fridge is
[0:18:43] kangg: katesEyes

[0:18:48] Nightbot: Follow Kate on Instagram! instagram.com/kate.ttv
[0:18:55] AshuraX13: Orange chair is tilting me
[0:19:00] rivierakid05: A little monochrome for my taste but not terrible
[0:19:01] ThordanSsoa: I'm not a fan of the monochrome aesthetic, but that might just be me
[0:19:02] Kthanid: Just let me curl up in the oven to nap.
[0:19:02] kangg: I’m curious to see what’s next door barbKEKD barbKEKD
[0:19:03] IchibaToll: The lone orange chair for a pop of color is a choice.
[0:19:04] kickwafer: come in, grab beer. perfect
[0:19:04] GenuineMind: the stove turns into a fold-out bed
[0:19:05] doc_sharon: if you want to live in a kitchen, this is for you
[0:19:10] CranApple_Juice: orange is the second worst color
[0:19:10] if0rg0t2remember: that fridge just sorta floating in no mans land by the door is kinda... katesSmile
[0:19:11] Rhiiiiiiiiiiiiii: 700sq ft of kitchen
[0:19:12] Nightbot: Use the link https://amzn.to/3Q8NOdW when buying things from Amazon if you'd like to help support me! I make a small commission from purchases made through that link. katesL
[0:19:20] Bowerbird7: is that a couch squished between the counter and the TV? Huh, yep...
[0:19:20] laxwall11: yeah had to get on it with these colors
[0:19:21] mostly_minerals: The chair KEKW
[0:19:25] CranApple_Juice: nah it's a hard list from Cran
[0:19:28] DirectorStephanie: Secret room???
[0:19:29] doc_sharon: reasonable, for less than a milly
[0:19:30] firefrye: probably outside
[0:19:36] hecktobreakfast: ooooooh I like it so far
[0:19:37] AshuraX13: They really did
[0:19:38] firefrye: that's likely the front door
[0:19:40] doc_sharon: Cleveland Browns fan NODDERS
[0:19:41] GoombaGary: It bothers me that it's blocking
[0:19:43] if0rg0t2remember: the chair, so you can watch people watching TV
[0:19:44] laxwall11: just a splash of color
[0:19:49] slmyrick: they’re definitely trying to recoup some money they invested with that milli they’re asking for
[0:19:49] GoombaGary: it's a fire hazard
[0:19:50] Denetti_: and that statement is ORANGE NODDERS
[0:19:53] CranApple_Juice: wait why is that doorway like 4 feet wide though
[0:19:56] NoharTheShark: maybe the chair is photoshopped in?
[0:19:59] cyclopsboi: and the statement is, "beware"
[0:20:00] firefrye: oh? I didn't think it was wide enough that direction
[0:20:03] doc_sharon: KEKW
[0:20:07] CranApple_Juice: oh
[0:20:10] KarnEvil: katesGiggle katesGiggle
[0:20:11] CranApple_Juice: maybe i am dumb
[0:20:14] gongzero: Taking Orange is the new black literally
[0:20:18] varbles: The fridge is in a bad spot. Open the front door smack into the fridge door.
[0:20:25] laxwall11: yeah that makes sense
[0:20:26] if0rg0t2remember: that type of fisheye is called diagonal fisheye FYI
[0:20:38] DirectorStephanie: @varbles that's a very good point
[0:20:43] doc_sharon: not the worst NODDERS
[0:20:48] frsttyyy: wait the stove doesnt have a vent?
[0:20:49] laxwall11: or maybe a water heater in there
[0:20:51] rivierakid05: Even if they moved the fridge closer to the window frame and farther from the door that would be better I think
[0:20:53] kaiguy6d9: rip pot filler
[0:21:02] CranApple_Juice: do we get polls on loafing or listing?
[0:21:03] laxwall11: to many chairs
[0:21:11] kangg: yeah it’s a decent kitchen
[0:21:15] doc_sharon: the more judgemental, the better NODDERS
[0:21:17] DirectorStephanie: @CranApple_Juice we do!
[0:21:18] Kthanid: And people WILL disagree on properties.
[0:21:20] rustenskurk: judgy about the houses but not the people
[0:21:24] CranApple_Juice: i have my vote im ready
[0:21:24] rivierakid05: We are fully here to be judgmental bitches KEKW
[0:21:24] NoharTheShark: love the wine glasses hanging from the ceiling
[0:21:27] doc_sharon: please check your feelings at the door NODDERS
[0:21:30] if0rg0t2remember: I think this is honestly a nice style just crammed into a space that doesn't fit it
[0:21:31] firefrye: you had a LITERAL Barbie kitchen once
[0:21:36] HantiChrist: floors are too warm for all of the grey
[0:21:37] varbles: @NoharTheShark LUL
[0:21:52] CranApple_Juice: and like
[0:21:53] doc_sharon: this is very masculine katesPlot
[0:21:56] missloux: sooo high
[0:22:00] Bowerbird7: yeah living room feels cramped
[0:22:00] rivierakid05: Hurts my neck to look at that TV
[0:22:04] kerrymshar: Break a neck to watch it
[0:22:06] firefrye: theater vibes
[0:22:06] ijustwanttosellout: Neck exercise included katesGiggle
[0:22:13] CranApple_Juice: it's a bit small for a 1.1 million dollar shack with high def weird art and stuff no?
[0:22:13] ExorcistFi: My neck hurts already
[0:22:13] jesterstrats: they really had to have the chair
[0:22:14] cyclopsboi: this looks like the bad rooms from unpacking
[0:22:17] ImTooOldForThisShit: Is the wall 3D?
[0:22:17] AshuraX13: It does
[0:22:18] Bowerbird7: is that why the sofa is like that? So they can lie back?
[0:22:19] GoombaGary: It's deep as heck
[0:22:20] doc_sharon: it really does
[0:22:22] NoharTheShark: i hate that the wall texture doesn't line up...
[0:22:22] CranApple_Juice: like the TV should be kinda huge imo
[0:22:23] if0rg0t2remember: it looks almost square
[0:22:24] brainbosh: The couch you lie on to watch
[0:22:28] aideenx98: Its so wide too
[0:22:29] rizey1: i was going to say it looks like a bed lol
[0:22:29] slmyrick: putting the HI in oHIo with that tv
[0:22:30] lorddracnor: it does
[0:22:30] DirectorStephanie: hideabed?
[0:22:32] missloux: gottta be super deep couch for tv that high
[0:22:34] firefrye: that's the fisheye. check the door. it's SEVERE in the photo
[0:22:37] kerrymshar: it looks like a lovesac one
[0:22:37] AshuraX13: Like a fainting couch
[0:22:43] aideenx98: Wtf is that???
[0:22:43] doc_sharon: that enrages me katesMadge
[0:22:49] aideenx98: Why block it???
[0:22:50] rivierakid05: Yeah that's terrible
[0:22:51] jesterstrats: that's a crime katesMadge
[0:22:52] rivierakid05: Jail
[0:22:54] DirectorStephanie: katesSus
[0:22:55] missloux: yup.... no thanks
[0:22:55] doc_sharon: especially since it's movibe
[0:23:00] doc_sharon: *mobile
[0:23:01] CranApple_Juice: why are there 2 speakers there
[0:23:02] NoharTheShark: fridge blocking the door
[0:23:03] GenuineMind: that shelf should move to the right
[0:23:04] Bowerbird7: the fridge and shelf unit placement there is a sure-fire sign of a psychopath
[0:23:05] doc_sharon: PREACH
[0:23:07] AshuraX13: A shelf with very little on it too
[0:23:09] aideenx98: So much unused light coming in
[0:23:12] cyclopsboi: i feel like the fridge is in the wrong spot
[0:23:13] if0rg0t2remember: fridge is too massive just sitting out in the room like that
[0:23:15] doc_sharon: I have one and I love it
[0:23:16] ImTooOldForThisShit: I can't walk into a home where the door is by the refrigerator. You think my hips can reach around that!?
[0:23:25] Denetti_: easy to grab a beer from the front door
[0:23:29] doc_sharon: it's a bed NODDERS
[0:23:30] GoombaGary: Imagine walking into the house and running into the fridge
[0:23:33] FantaSciFile_Keiannah: it’s not like the kitchen is light on storage either.
[0:23:34] varbles: Cuddle puddle couch
[0:23:36] lorddracnor: that's why the TV is so high
[0:23:38] aideenx98: That looks so comfyyyy
[0:23:38] firefrye: lounge couch
[0:23:39] doc_sharon: maybe that is why the TV is so high KEKW
[0:23:41] if0rg0t2remember: laying on the couch may explain the high TV
[0:23:41] GenuineMind: casting couch deluxe
[0:23:42] ImTooOldForThisShit: That is a lived in couch
[0:23:46] NoharTheShark: hairy pillows too
[0:23:48] Rhiiiiiiiiiiiiii: The 2rd bedroom nobody talked about
[0:23:49] FantaSciFile_Keiannah: they did not need a storage piece in from of the window.
[0:23:49] CranApple_Juice: @GenuineMind AYOO
[0:23:49] Bowerbird7: I guess it makes watching your weirdly high TV more comfortable?
[0:23:58] Rhiiiiiiiiiiiiii: 3rd eveb
[0:23:58] xX_Before_The_Dawn_Xx: looks like two chaise lounges  put together
[0:23:59] doc_sharon: katesHm
[0:24:02] aideenx98: way too big
[0:24:03] TheHungryEntry: It just looks like a architect pc drawings  and not real
[0:24:03] ThordanSsoa: That's a whole bed
[0:24:13] aideenx98: AHHHHHH
[0:24:14] FatBlackPatrickSwayze: Tiny house. GIANT furniture.
[0:24:14] abblepiewit: couch for very tall people
[0:24:14] lorddracnor: bruh
[0:24:15] cyclopsboi: that fridge is deeper than the island
[0:24:15] GoombaGary: WHY
[0:24:16] DirectorStephanie: I don't think I can describe it accurately but for those that can -- what is a fresco? I saw someone ask about that earlier
[0:24:17] AshuraX13: Fer why though
[0:24:18] rivierakid05: Gotta be laying down to watch that TV
[0:24:18] aideenx98: NAHHHH
[0:24:18] kerrymshar: Why is it sooo big
[0:24:19] doc_sharon: that's so annoying
[0:24:21] ImTooOldForThisShit: I'm screaming
[0:24:23] Rhiiiiiiiiiiiiii: Whyyyyy
[0:24:24] aideenx98: WHYY
[0:24:28] GoombaGary: Hey where do we put this fridge? Dunno middle of the room?
[0:24:29] doc_sharon: the fridge and the sofa are both too deep KEKW
[0:24:30] DaveBerts: covers up the window too
[0:24:31] firefrye: is there a radiator on the floor???
[0:24:31] jesterstrats: you could fit a fridge behind your fridge KEKW
[0:24:33] rizey1: the light above the fridge is setting off my ocd
[0:24:34] DirectorStephanie: to get the dust?
[0:24:35] kerrymshar: that upsets me
[0:24:36] Rhiiiiiiiiiiiiii: No bueno
[0:24:41] cyclopsboi: fridge almost as deep as the couch
[0:24:41] if0rg0t2remember: that is the "we don't know where to put the fridge, so we left it where the installers dropped it"\
[0:24:47] DaveBerts: oh shit
[0:24:55] SailorAriel333: hate that shelf! aaarg
[0:24:56] AshuraX13: katesMadge
[0:24:59] Bowerbird7: Fridge really looks like an afterthought
[0:25:00] missloux: yeah that annoys me so much
[0:25:04] DirectorStephanie: Would that be upsetting asymmetry?
[0:25:05] doc_sharon: someone needs to move the fridge, chair, and that FUCKING shelf katesMadge
[0:25:06] lorddracnor: It's like the put the fridge there last minute
[0:25:07] laxwall11: AAAA
[0:25:08] Scena16: Did they take pictures mid moving it ?
[0:25:08] rivierakid05: Everything about the fridge is just terrible
[0:25:10] slmyrick: the door handle is gonna damage the side of the fridge too
[0:25:11] kerrymshar: its like they pulled it out to clean and never put it back
[0:25:13] Thorn104: have they shown a picture of the Island from the other side?
[0:25:15] Rhiiiiiiiiiiiiii: tobiiiDead
[0:25:16] laxwall11: why is it so forward
[0:25:17] firefrye: I think that's a floating fridge they moved for the photos. no way that's normally there
[0:25:24] NoharTheShark: fridge was delivered the day the photo was taken and it's just where the delivery people left it
[0:25:27] doc_sharon: someone vaccuumed for the pictures and did not move anything back KEKW
[0:25:32] CranApple_Juice: is that
[0:25:37] GoombaGary: This distracting wall art
[0:25:37] Bowerbird7: "We should put a fridge here, that's a thing humans have. Just put it anywhere, that's fine."
[0:25:38] CranApple_Juice: is that a chrome console thingy
[0:25:40] Mr_Smiley82: great view of the tv from the orange chair
[0:25:40] cyclopsboi: that wall pattern is awful
[0:25:41] AshuraX13: I am tripping over that chair in the middle of the night
[0:25:44] FatBlackPatrickSwayze: It IS tilted down, at least.
[0:25:45] dat_dude_dewey: tv super crooked, too
[0:25:47] johnothetree: tv too high fr
[0:25:48] CranApple_Juice: that's
[0:25:50] laxwall11: tv does not need to be that high that close to the couch
[0:25:51] CranApple_Juice: abysmal
[0:25:52] lorddracnor: so little space and they are fudging it all up!
[0:25:52] CranApple_Juice: i hate it
[0:25:55] pickleviiiic: Exposed hanging cables bug me
[0:25:59] slmyrick: I like the accent wall textures tho.
[0:26:02] zemoj: oh yeah the wall panels dont line up
[0:26:02] FatBlackPatrickSwayze: I'm TRYING to find positives.
[0:26:03] varbles: With how out of style the chair is, I think the real estate agent staging the place put it there because they thought the room needed more color.
[0:26:08] HantiChrist: cable management pls
[0:26:10] jesterstrats: I can't unsee the tilted TV katesSmile
[0:26:12] Chellekat_: tilted down enough to reflect whatever you're watching off the top of the console
[0:26:14] cyclopsboi: its asymmetric
[0:26:15] Denetti_: TV also tilted to right
[0:26:15] Rhiiiiiiiiiiiiii: It's not even
[0:26:16] Bowerbird7: I'd argue that it's tilted a little too far down compared to the couch placement tbh
[0:26:23] FatBlackPatrickSwayze: Also, the TV is crooked.
[0:26:26] if0rg0t2remember: I love a good accent wall honestly, but the panels don't align regularly
[0:26:26] doc_sharon: NOOO
[0:26:29] kerrymshar: why did you point it out
[0:26:30] doc_sharon: its not even NOOO
[0:26:30] kittysaur112: The wall decoration is unsubmetrical and it does not continue over the doorway
[0:26:30] abblepiewit: ugh cannot unsee now NOOO
[0:26:31] Rhiiiiiiiiiiiiii: I hate it
[0:26:32] slmyrick: abstract 🤷🏼‍♀️
[0:26:35] GoombaGary: None of the panels are aligned
[0:26:37] Chellekat_: that's a DIY gone wrong
[0:26:38] doc_sharon: WHY did I look at that NOOO
[0:26:39] laxwall11: i dont understand the pattern
[0:26:42] yggdr4s17: thatbi5HI thatbi5HI thatbi5HI  hello kate! Kreygasm on cam to!
[0:26:43] SailorAriel333: oh no
[0:26:43] Bowerbird7: it doesn't line up in any meaningful way...
[0:26:48] AshuraX13: katesPalm
[0:26:49] jesterstrats: NOOO
[0:26:50] doc_sharon: MY EYES NOOO
[0:26:53] laxwall11: ooooooo
[0:26:55] GrumpyPanduh: they did it on the other side too
[0:26:55] laxwall11: yeah
[0:26:59] doc_sharon: I hate it NOPERS
[0:27:00] GoombaGary: Look at the joint near the door
[0:27:01] Bowerbird7: yeah that'd bug me
[0:27:02] MrBiggieD: That would drive me IMSANE
[0:27:04] NoharTheShark: i think they got leftover pieces and just cobbled it together
[0:27:05] GoombaGary: above the lightswitch
[0:27:06] cyclopsboi: thats what i mean
[0:27:06] jesterstrats: there's no pattern over the door either
[0:27:06] Rhiiiiiiiiiiiiii: smh no just NO!
[0:27:08] laxwall11: now that you pointed it out I cant un see it
[0:27:08] firefrye: the wall fits the simplistic vibes everywhere else. Geometric patterns go with black and white... but that's badly done. And the Orange chair is an eyesore
[0:27:10] cyclopsboi: its awful
[0:27:12] ijustwanttosellout: Now I can't unseen it gdi katesSuffer
[0:27:13] Bowerbird7: at least it's correctly mirrored?
[0:27:14] jennielouwho: katesSuffer
[0:27:14] if0rg0t2remember: it feels intentional since the two sides match
[0:27:17] DirectorStephanie: Mark off DIY gone wrong or upsetting asymmetry on your bingo cards!
[0:27:17] dat_dude_dewey: my OCD won't let me keep watching this stream
[0:27:18] rivierakid05: I feel like they're trying to make it look like it was on purpose but I don't think it was katesPalm
[0:27:20] DirectorStephanie: !bingo
[0:27:20] Nightbot: Bingo card for Loaf It Or List It katesCheer https://bingobaker.com/#fb887652669a1aea
[0:27:20] onlythomwilltell: And the design doesn't continue over the door.
[0:27:23] kerrymshar: katesSuffer
[0:27:25] doc_sharon: peepoLeave I hate it here
[0:27:26] DaveBerts: symmetry is the enemy kate duhhh LUL
[0:27:31] GoombaGary: Intentionally bad?
[0:27:39] MyNemesisTAZ: Hi Kate kates5
[0:27:39] CranApple_Juice: D: hey
[0:27:44] lorddracnor: cruel intentions
[0:27:45] ghost_waz: having seen the houses we've looked at before, I can totally believe it
[0:27:46] Nightbot: Follow Kate on Instagram! instagram.com/kate.ttv
[0:27:46] IchibaToll: Those people did not understand how to cut crown molding
[0:27:48] GoombaGary: Try to follow the square by the light swtich
[0:27:50] laxwall11: or they matched it after fucking up the first thing
[0:27:52] cyclopsboi: the pattern looks like AI designed it
[0:27:57] NoharTheShark: they centered it to the tv instead of the room
[0:27:57] rustenskurk: Can we call this upsetting asymmetry for the bingo?
[0:27:57] if0rg0t2remember: we've seen some of these houses on Loaf it or List it right? Intentionally bad seems par for the course
[0:28:03] Bowerbird7: This feels like an alien lives here and is trying to blend in both way too hard and not enough at the same time
[0:28:06] Dagosn: It's like free form jazz.
[0:28:09] GoombaGary: it's so unaligned.  It's not a square
[0:28:09] HantiChrist: the artwork is giving first year graphic design student
[0:28:10] OutlandAsh: the rectangles not being the same size bother me
[0:28:18] doc_sharon: stop trying to justify this monstrosity katesMadge
[0:28:23] gorksterific: thats about when they fired their handyman
[0:28:27] slmyrick: ran out of scrap pieces
[0:28:28] fattydelrey: or in the middle
[0:28:29] rizey1: did they paint the light switch?
[0:28:35] firefrye: whoever designed this makes the decorations for cheap chain restaurants
[0:28:47] if0rg0t2remember: also where the gray wall meets the white wall is VERY poorly done, lots of globs over the corner
[0:28:51] kx07stitch: hot take this living room doesn’t bother me lol katesGiggle
[0:28:53] doc_sharon: and then they filled in the space, but unevenly
[0:28:58] laxwall11: you needs to measure when you see a TikTok
[0:28:59] rustenskurk: That wall sucks huh
[0:29:00] GoombaGary: Not the tiktok floor
[0:29:00] Bowerbird7: I hate those bricks
[0:29:01] ThordanSsoa: why the exposed brick?
[0:29:03] rivierakid05: Hmm
[0:29:04] doc_sharon: hh
[0:29:04] eddieatthegov: @firefrye Savage.
[0:29:05] jesterstrats: wtf is that brick
[0:29:05] doc_sharon: huh
[0:29:06] DirectorStephanie: whut
[0:29:07] firefrye: exposed "vintage bricks"
[0:29:08] varbles: rxyThink
[0:29:09] AshuraX13: katesPlot
[0:29:10] cyclopsboi: bathroom giving cask of amontillado vibes
[0:29:11] marmosetius: I need the most exposed brick you have
[0:29:11] kerrymshar: the bricks why
[0:29:14] doc_sharon: not awful
[0:29:14] if0rg0t2remember: I'm guessing that was once an exterior wall
[0:29:15] NoharTheShark: there was brick in the kitchen too
[0:29:16] GoombaGary: oh god the shower tile being wavy
[0:29:16] rivierakid05: Don’t hate it ngl
[0:29:19] FatBlackPatrickSwayze: I quite like the tile
[0:29:21] CranApple_Juice: bricks can go hard but those are shit
[0:29:22] Denetti_: is that the wall of the building next door?
[0:29:23] xalexpaige: omg I have those ugly tiles in my bathroom lol
[0:29:23] aideenx98: I don't like the shower tub situation
[0:29:24] mostly_minerals: Upsetting asymmetry CHECK
[0:29:25] kangg: barbLUL
[0:29:25] Scena16: Did they forget to finish the wall?
[0:29:26] rustenskurk: Exposed bricks can be okay, but why is this so sloppy?
[0:29:26] jesterstrats: the cabinet doors are scratched up
[0:29:29] TheHungryEntry: Intresting to say one thing
[0:29:31] firefrye: @eddieatthegov I've worked at 2 of those... LUL
[0:29:31] ThordanSsoa: That grout job is awful
[0:29:33] rivierakid05: Yeah better bricking would be great
[0:29:37] GoombaGary: It has no business touching the floor
[0:29:42] l_meta: you have to duck to take a shower?! HUHH
[0:29:43] GoombaGary: not with that high of ceilings
[0:29:44] doc_sharon: agree NODDERS
[0:29:44] eddieatthegov: I'm short and that's low.
[0:29:45] slmyrick: you want to feel like you’re living in New York but are actually in Ohio…here’s some bricks
[0:29:46] cyclopsboi: shower curtain should be at least above the shower head
[0:29:46] MaxxEMoose: The morter  between the bricks gives me mental pain
[0:29:52] TheOtherCindy: bricks for exfoliation?
[0:29:53] Chellekat_: the off-center 'beam' above the shower
[0:29:53] ThordanSsoa: The shower curtain should be a few inches off the floor for sure
[0:30:02] TheHungryEntry: Maybe a short person
[0:30:03] doc_sharon: it makes the towel bar look too high, too
[0:30:04] rustenskurk: Is the cabinet doors really scratched?
[0:30:06] mostly_minerals: Imagine the mold that can grow in that brick n mortar
[0:30:11] IchibaToll: WTF are those bricks?  I have never in my life seen that style of brick.
[0:30:12] Ms_LadyMix: The head's so low though, my 5'8 ass could never
[0:30:13] doc_sharon: yep
[0:30:16] kittysaur112: In a bathroom the brick will take in moisture and thats not good
[0:30:17] GoombaGary: They just had a lot of extra 2x4's waiting to be painted
[0:30:21] lorddracnor: no words
[0:30:21] onlythomwilltell: I wonder if it's bad staging and they moved the shower curtain bar down for the photo.
[0:30:22] DirectorStephanie: Everyone in this house played in the NBA
[0:30:22] firefrye: Is it actually tall? or is the image stretched vertically this time?
[0:30:23] NoharTheShark: maybe they really want to see the room while they're in there
[0:30:32] GoombaGary: Brick????
[0:30:32] CranApple_Juice: wow
[0:30:33] DirectorStephanie: there's no TP?
[0:30:34] varbles: There are multiple types of bricks too
[0:30:34] abblepiewit: Couch for tall people, bathroom for shorter people katesGiggle
[0:30:35] if0rg0t2remember: I like the showerhead at least
[0:30:39] cyclopsboi: that outlet also doesnt appear to be up to code
[0:30:39] doc_sharon: this is passabe NODDERS
[0:30:40] slmyrick: the faucet looks beefy for that size of bathroom
[0:30:41] AshuraX13: katesSmile
[0:30:49] CranApple_Juice: going through real estate is fascinating from a girls pov, you guys are nuts
[0:30:52] kaiguy6d9: why is the wood so distressed?
[0:30:52] IchibaToll: Wait, what is going on with that vanity and brick?
[0:30:53] jesterstrats: the bricks and shower tile are completely different patterns katesSmile
[0:30:54] MaxxEMoose: katesSmile
[0:30:54] NoharTheShark: they can scratch their backs on the shower wall
[0:30:56] DirectorStephanie: what is THAT
[0:30:59] mostly_minerals: HUHH
[0:30:59] varbles: That corner.
[0:31:00] kangg: closet bathroom next
[0:31:01] jesterstrats: HUHH
[0:31:01] Ms_LadyMix: That's not a display blanket
[0:31:02] AshuraX13: Chrome fireplace?
[0:31:02] Chellekat_: miror fireplace
[0:31:04] FatBlackPatrickSwayze: The blue is a CHOICE
[0:31:05] Bowerbird7: continue to hate the brick
[0:31:05] eddieatthegov: What...?
[0:31:09] if0rg0t2remember: oooh I have "bedding matches curtains exactly"

[0:31:16] laxwall11: AAAA
[0:31:16] Bowerbird7: yeah that looks gross
[0:31:17] kerrymshar: why is there expanding foam in the corner
[0:31:20] mostly_minerals: That lamp looks so agressive
[0:31:20] GrumpyPanduh: CLASSIC
[0:31:20] CranApple_Juice: does thsi count as visibly dirty
[0:31:22] teacupcryptids: Why is this a college boy's first non-dorm room?
[0:31:23] Mr_Smiley82: draft solved
[0:31:24] laxwall11: just like outside lol
[0:31:25] slmyrick: that’s a whoopsie if I’ve ever seen one
[0:31:25] ghost_waz: that was, a choice
[0:31:25] doc_sharon: that is LAZY as fuck KEKW
[0:31:25] GoombaGary: Wait Kate move your face.  Is that a different brick colour?
[0:31:25] NoharTheShark: mirrored fireplace?
[0:31:27] Hoocairz: Hoocairz subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! katesL
[0:31:28] cyclopsboi: blue velvet bedroom
[0:31:30] bluewhatev: It's fire foam, they probably had to do it for code
[0:31:30] rivierakid05: katesPlot
[0:31:30] IchibaToll: They couldn't cover that with molding?
[0:31:34] DirectorStephanie: katesL katesL katesL
[0:31:35] lorddracnor: burn it down
[0:31:36] kerrymshar: also two types of brick
[0:31:38] doc_sharon: the shiny TV stand again KEKW
[0:31:38] Bowerbird7: I was like "This doesn't seem so bad" then the longer I look, the more I notice
[0:31:39] dat_dude_dewey: the shiny mantle is a crime against humanity
[0:31:43] GoombaGary: Burn it
[0:31:43] doc_sharon: katesL katesL katesL
[0:31:44] FatBlackPatrickSwayze: Perfect.
[0:31:45] GoombaGary: the whole thing
[0:31:49] CranApple_Juice: @DirectorStephanie stpeh does this count as visibly dirty
[0:31:52] firefrye: that looks original. This has vibes of a "historic downtown building we're not allowed to change too much"
[0:31:56] kangg: katesSee you weren’t supposed to see that TheIlluminati
[0:31:58] varbles: The splotches on the brick on the top right too????
[0:31:59] if0rg0t2remember: the Motel 6 velvet blanket is not the way
[0:32:00] doc_sharon: huh
[0:32:01] ijustwanttosellout: If this is 1.1. mil worth the housing market in Cleveland must be f'd katesGiggle
[0:32:02] mostly_minerals: KEKW
[0:32:04] Bowerbird7: that doesn't seem safe
[0:32:04] GrumpyPanduh: LUL
[0:32:05] GoombaGary: Off with their heads I guess
[0:32:07] CranApple_Juice: ABSOLUTELY NOT
[0:32:08] Siirika: Its a bricked up window being used as a shelf katesSmile
[0:32:08] doc_sharon: that's kind of dope
[0:32:09] AshuraX13: You can see the edges of the blades
[0:32:12] ghost_waz: this place looks like it would be *so close* to being good, and yet
[0:32:13] sharingiskaren: that was an outdoor wall I think
[0:32:14] doc_sharon: I kind of love that KEKW
[0:32:19] varbles: And what is that chrome fireplace\tv stand?
[0:32:19] ThordanSsoa: Finally got a bingo square. Those curtains are a dead match for the bedding
[0:32:23] DaveBerts: did we talk about the calk in the far corner?
[0:32:27] DirectorStephanie: @CranApple_Juice I think that's a Kate call. Kate, would you say that spray foam counts as visible dirt or dust or stains?
[0:32:27] Scena16: Thats Wikked
[0:32:27] firefrye: that "fireplace" is incredibly tacky
[0:32:29] lorddracnor: that's so cool, but I hate it in this room so much!
[0:32:33] cyclopsboi: that bedspread looks like a towel
[0:32:34] Bowerbird7: I like the idea of that, I hate the idea of that hanging so low above a bed
[0:32:37] GoombaGary: They couldn't mount the TV?
[0:32:44] Steambottom: they like the mirrored furniture look
[0:32:44] firefrye: mirrored with fingerprints
[0:32:51] UppyFF: it looks like they ran out of money and good all their furniture from good will stores
[0:32:52] doc_sharon: agree NODDERS
[0:32:54] CranApple_Juice: @DirectorStephanie well theres also like rust down on the bottom near the floor next to the gross fireplace
[0:32:59] NoharTheShark: are the curtains and the blanket the same thing?
[0:33:03] laxwall11: this is asking for a million right? lol
[0:33:09] DirectorStephanie: Perfect, thanks!
[0:33:12] slmyrick: also living room tv too high…bedroom tv feels too low
[0:33:16] ghost_waz: Also - weird to have high hats with fan/lights?
[0:33:17] if0rg0t2remember: this is a formerly exterior wall is what this is
[0:33:19] HantiChrist: it’s not turquoise, it’s not lapis, it’s actually cerulean.
[0:33:25] BleedingToast: kinamaWave hello, have i missed much
[0:33:27] FatBlackPatrickSwayze: It would be $1.2M if they just gutted the place.
[0:33:32] doc_sharon: hi @BleedingToast
[0:33:33] GoombaGary: Would this qualify as a Chanfelier of Damocles with the bladeS?
[0:33:34] DirectorStephanie: @BleedingToast this is still our first home!@
[0:33:40] frsttyyy: @BleedingToast first house barely halfway
[0:33:40] eddieatthegov: There are a lot of neat ideas that don't meld.
[0:33:41] sharingiskaren: that’s a bad addition ew
[0:33:43] GoombaGary: Couch??
[0:33:43] Bowerbird7: would one classify this fan as a "Chandelier of Damocles" technically? LUL
[0:33:43] slmyrick: depending on what neck exercise you need you pick a room
[0:33:44] AMPC0IL: @FatBlackPatrickSwayze True!
[0:33:45] stormscenes: oh
[0:33:46] laxwall11: huh
[0:33:46] doc_sharon: huh
[0:33:46] marmosetius: it looks unstable
[0:33:46] ThordanSsoa: See, this is the TV that should have been mounted high and the living room one should be low
[0:33:47] aideenx98: wft is that bed
[0:33:47] ghost_waz: the fan seems unnecessary
[0:33:48] lorddracnor: I hate this so much, SO MUCH!
[0:33:50] AshuraX13: What is this bedframe?
[0:33:50] UppyFF: lmao there’s a cuck couch for Wade
[0:33:52] jennielouwho: katesHUH
[0:33:53] slmyrick: wtf is that
[0:33:53] Bowerbird7: what is this bed?
[0:33:54] cyclopsboi: wtf is that bed height
[0:33:54] GoombaGary: What are we watching AYO
[0:33:54] jesterstrats: it's not even the same shade of blue as the couch
[0:33:56] stormscenes: katesSmile
[0:33:56] rizey1: it all looks odd
[0:33:57] doc_sharon: why is the bed so high
[0:33:57] mostly_minerals: Spider leg bed
[0:33:57] jesterstrats: NOOO
[0:33:57] if0rg0t2remember: oh and the EXACTLY matching sofa. did they buy this from an old motel?
[0:33:58] GrumpyPanduh: lmaooo
[0:34:00] kerrymshar: why a couch in the room
[0:34:01] DirectorStephanie: @UppyFF OMG
[0:34:02] Natur3Gaming: Why is there a couch in the bedroom?
[0:34:03] BearClawPhD: window behind the bed... katesSmile

[0:34:08] laxwall11: AAAA
[0:34:08] BleedingToast: whats wrong with that bed????
[0:34:10] onlythomwilltell: That headboard is an interesting choice with the rest of the decor
[0:34:11] SailorAriel333: what is that headboard and unmatched bed supports
[0:34:12] xX_Before_The_Dawn_Xx: did they DIY the bed frame?
[0:34:14] ghost_waz: oh is this a folding bed?
[0:34:18] CranApple_Juice: the headboard gives "im rich" but the covers give "im chad from sigma chi sorry your dog died ahaha youre so sexy"
[0:34:20] Bowerbird7: fancy bed head, bed looks like a mattress on a fold out table
[0:34:21] ghost_waz: like a guest bed?
[0:34:22] GoombaGary: No night tables
[0:34:23] doc_sharon: why are all the couches so big
[0:34:24] FatBlackPatrickSwayze: that is a hilariously tall bedframe
[0:34:26] Thorn104: the mattress looks shitty
[0:34:26] Retro_Crisis: I'd like that couch for my living room.
[0:34:28] NoharTheShark: i wonder if it folds out into a futon
[0:34:29] missloux: HATE the bed
[0:34:29] kangg: lose the couch and get an armoy
[0:34:29] firefrye: again. I've seen spray foam in historic downtown buildings around where I live. and with such small floor plans they don't feel justified losing 4-6in for insulation and drywall
[0:34:32] if0rg0t2remember: why is the bed so tall
[0:34:32] kerrymshar: thats a whole ass couch that could be in the living room
[0:34:33] frsttyyy: bed looks super tall
[0:34:34] eddieatthegov: What is that beg frame?
[0:34:38] RubyBlade_: That couch would be perfect for the living room where they have the omega couch KEKW
[0:34:39] sharingiskaren: all furniture up against the wall
[0:34:43] Retro_Crisis: The legs on this thing are...odd
[0:34:44] UppyFF: lmao toothpicks
[0:34:44] GoombaGary: Wait why do we have the Fan light but also pot lights?
[0:34:46] Natur3Gaming: Is it a window or a door?
[0:34:47] ghost_waz: this is giving me extra guest bed energy
[0:34:48] NoharTheShark: looks like folding table legs
[0:34:48] cyclopsboi: "box spring? whats that"
[0:34:50] Bowerbird7: bed frame looks like a couple of cheap tables
[0:34:54] doc_sharon: the headboard looks disjoint
[0:34:54] Steambottom: lots of underbed storage
[0:34:58] FantaSciFile_Keiannah: looks like a queen head bed and a full size frame.
[0:34:58] slmyrick: that bed frame! literally straight out of college. but found a headboard on Craigslist
[0:34:59] sharingiskaren: I think they were told to add a bedroom for the asking price
[0:35:04] BleedingToast: is the headboard from a different bed?
[0:35:05] UppyFF: is it a table with a blanket ontop
[0:35:06] kerrymshar: the frame doesnt even fit the head board
[0:35:07] if0rg0t2remember: headboard just doesn't match the rest of the style IMHO
[0:35:10] cyclopsboi: this looks like someone threw a headboard on cot
[0:35:11] varbles: I don't think the bed frame is actually attached to the headboard.
[0:35:11] firefrye: that's a cheap metal frame that lets them dissemble it to fit it through the doors/halls
[0:35:15] Retro_Crisis: This just seems wrong
[0:35:18] HantiChrist: and the pink in the carpet?? like what
[0:35:22] ghost_waz: I think this is just showing an extra guest bed tbh
[0:35:25] FatBlackPatrickSwayze: lol stagers?
[0:35:28] Bowerbird7: I'm still going with this house belonging to an alien with a superficial understanding of what a human dwelling should be
[0:35:33] NoharTheShark: do those bed legs count as indoor pillars?
[0:35:34] frsttyyy: why would you cover the window with the bed when you have a couch anyway?
[0:35:38] Natur3Gaming: I believe that the "window" is a door
[0:35:41] FantaSciFile_Keiannah: that talk a bed needs a bed skirt
[0:35:45] kangg: where’s the closet space in this master bedroom?
[0:35:45] doc_sharon: katesPlot
[0:35:46] HantiChrist: this looks AI generated
[0:35:56] bluewhatev: the pink in the carpet reminds me of the powder they used to put on vomit at school
[0:35:58] lorddracnor: whole ass cuck couch and the bed's elevated like it's meant for a show

[0:38:47] AshuraX13: Oh ok
[0:38:48] frsttyyy: how do they justify the 1.1m price tag
[0:38:52] rivierakid05: Is this $1.1 mil house really so small that you had to put your breaker box and dryer in a random hallway???
