[7:24:34] vincentvcu: mike is in anita strain
[7:24:42] davidhughes123456: did ray get bonked earlier chat?
[7:24:42] redhrafn: @fanasakafanat1k delusional
[7:24:43] sleetsb: you guys removed ming
[7:24:44] neblina3: AnitaMaxWynn
[7:24:45] dkakr: gotta change strain name
[7:24:48] fakebanter: bonk speedy
[7:24:51] KOYOSOMMABABY: zaza=anita?
[7:24:57] hacapu: they didnt grow anita yet no?
[7:24:58] wrkingclasshero: Or it just slowly goes down
[7:24:58] Sniferas1: time to bonk speedy
[7:25:04] wrkingclasshero: Which would make sense
[7:25:05] bigbratwurst: benji put zaza on anita seller
[7:25:05] fish99: common sense would say the more the locals get scooby the more they forgoet zaza
[7:25:07] kynartO: Speedy bonk. LUL
[7:25:08] seix123: yeah your ZAZA is going down
[7:25:10] axiiiomatic: hes so quiet
[7:25:10] fambaa: who knows how the rep works, doesnt look like tug of war because scooby has 100% and zaza 58% plus so its not 50/50
[7:25:13] Astralduelist: @KOYOSOMMABABY anita = max win
[7:25:14] MrDragassassin: @KOYOSOMMABABY no anita is the new strain
[7:25:17] Dirtyriver: or like Ray said first could be because they are tanking rep on cypress or it’s because of selling Zaza in north
[7:25:20] FanasAKAFanat1k: cooked zaza
[7:25:20] Yaranaika789: AnitaMaxWynn
[7:25:20] Rohanone1: or was it becouse RAY is selling ZAZA??
[7:25:23] IndigoKaede: @jojo_s93 i were going on usmeni 4 times and dude just hates me, failes me everytime, disrespects me but nthn i can do abt it so im redoing written one
[7:25:27] sad_sacrieur: what's the rep at?

[7:25:38] ArZuKa: yes
[7:25:39] edelnerd: 100p
[7:25:40] PersonalNemesis: move Fred over to Anita just pump it to 100
[7:25:40] xatonoi: YES
[7:25:40] hacapu: that make more sense
[7:25:44] seix123: Should be
[7:25:44] Yami_Sun: Lol
[7:25:45] ThatBritMan: That makes sense
[7:25:47] Rohanone1: that makes sense
[7:25:47] wrkingclasshero: I think it is more likely because no one is sellling Zaza on Cypress.
[7:25:48] KjuggernautP: then we gotta move out Aware
[7:25:48] blueprint988: yep
[7:25:48] Dirtyriver: seems like it would like old meth turf
[7:25:50] nanaosaki_ee: the locals shooting looks so scary honestly
[7:25:51] PLO_Renegade: it makes sense that it lowers others rep

[7:26:00] bluguss: no comra hende
[7:26:00] lovelylavendah: latino king
[7:26:01] vincentvcu: no, is probably because mike is selling zaza in another strain @ray__c
[7:26:03] blueprint988: they're selling non stop it makes sense
[7:26:04] Tinos86: i think they can all 100% rep
[7:26:05] fish99: the locals are forgetting zaza
[7:26:05] Najb0lji: you think their's would have dropped too
[7:26:06] allanthomasivanHD: +1
[7:26:06] sad_sacrieur: what's the rep at? 󠀀
[7:26:07] neblina3: he said, you don't respect us
[7:26:10] fambaa: @Ray__C but the % doesn't add up if only 100% is allowed then zaza and scooby would add up to 100% but they don't
[7:26:11] catechism_: It's war 4.0 not nopixel anymore
[7:26:13] Najb0lji: is it like tug of war
[7:26:21] werm25: didn't benji give Zaza to the seller on the other turf? I'd assume that's why maybe?
[7:26:25] Dirtyriver: @najb0lji maybe it doesn’t once it makes it to 100
[7:26:35] baesona: WHEN COMPANY SIGNATURE LOGO? PauseChamp

[8:17:28] spyrospns: who got the scooby
[8:17:28] Muijf: @SAVASTAN00 They know that. Also I am sure everyone knows OOC that there's no real benefit. It's just because RP has to be played out. That's why they want a consensus today. Lang and Co. started this, it wouldn't make sense not to act on it. This is mostly just to benefit the viewers of the oldbois storyline, but the company will probably get something in return too

[9:13:26] sw_yy: @ejc380 most likely, i wonder how it works if other players can get robbed or if they get "robbed" but other locals in their area. could be like each sale has a chance to roll for a loss of a certain amount of weed or money that they have.
[9:13:27] Skinnydeads: @joshcowan nah, removes ads from the channel you are subbed to and when chat goes in sub-only mode you can still chat

[9:37:54] unholy_steve: can you click on it
[9:37:56] avivbenami: Maybe saturation?
[9:37:56] Mrglaconnn: Market saturation of the weed laybe
[9:37:56] DaniskaDaniska: Saturation maybe
[9:37:58] matchabread: maybe more locals?

[9:38:02] matchabread: more popular
[9:38:06] Frostz420: why did they decide on sandy ?
[9:38:07] ichiiku: i think its tug of war like x said since u can see the other people their %
[9:38:07] Sherm0: the turf itself collects from everyone selling?

[9:38:36] jasonflipmode: Is it legal to sell in the game like it is in the street guys
[9:38:37] lukesky_: So much for selling at Sandy without it being known
[9:38:38] differentendzstream: @ray__c ITS PROBABLY IF HIGHER PERCENTAGE THE MORE PEOPLE THERE ARE TO SELL THATS WHY SANDY IS DRY RN

[9:38:41] SurvivorPlayz999: VoteYea
[9:38:46] Hiooplolz: Mike is lead seller
[9:38:47] lemniarts: probably meant so people can avoid turfs with high density of sellers
[9:38:48] Muijf: Then it should balance 100% between all turfs honestly, but it makes sense
[9:38:49] carthegenian: the ZA ZA
[9:38:51] tumon_tumon: mike is seller 2 right
[9:38:54] moonfairy__: mike seems like a smart cookie raycNodders
