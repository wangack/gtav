[1:48:08] JeredAUS: tik tok brain can't watch a 50 min vid
[1:48:09] tylecs: there was a loud moustache guy yelling aggressively 10/10
[1:48:12] TheSnarkasaurus: I didn't watch it ngl
[1:48:14] IronMax6: because you spoiled a 14 year old game Kappa
[1:48:14] ScytheOcelot: FUCK
[1:48:17] 0verthinks: tiktok ruined concentration
[1:48:19] captinkempo: dude i gave you so much watch time long ago cause i would just relisten to the outro song
[1:48:21] MoneyTwit: I wanna say I found that structure really repetitive I watched it fully through but I got tired of the structure a bit

[1:48:38] jazmineerose: stranger
[1:48:39] gamblegambit06: personally i think ya smashed it with the last one
[1:48:41] OzzyOzalp: just so you know mate i believe that for these kinds of videos (trophy hunting) the videos should be longer @crayator
[1:48:45] sasha_jolie: gonna finish undead vod have fun HeyGuys
[1:48:46] xxDentwitchxx: o7
[1:48:48] ScytheOcelot: Cray is our biological internet dad/mum
[1:48:49] fruitinmymouth: yea that guy right
[1:48:55] rishu_sharma191: u need to start posting more horror games with buzz on YouTube outlast trials was hilarious
[1:48:56] oxygenIess: Sound effects and voice over needs work, joelmz is a really good example
[1:49:00] WattiesSauce: oop I agree too, it didn't hold a good story arch it was too linear
[1:49:00] notwillzz: cray what was your favorite click video?
[1:49:02] professortrent1: agreed mix it up maybe split into 2 shorter videos
[1:49:09] mahum_4848: I did enjoy how u said what each trophy was makes it easier to understand
[1:49:13] bamzie_: NotLikeThis
[1:49:27] ScytheOcelot: Come on Cray you can't ban a fellow Aussie that would be a crime against Australian humanity
[1:49:28] joesullivan101: No
[1:49:28] johnlloydstephe: No
[1:49:30] uncle_mount_: no lol
[1:49:33] James_Lick: HUH

[1:49:43] DylanBylan2: get him a car
[1:49:45] rvdrko10067: you were meant to give him a lift to the golf club
[1:49:49] kyberkay: give him a ride lmao
[1:49:50] IronMax6: he plays golf, you did the right thing Cray
[1:49:51] bamzie_: You were supposed to pick him up lmao
[1:49:51] notwillzz: cray what was your favorite click video
[1:49:52] uncle_mount_: drive him to the golf course
[1:49:56] gamblegambit06: the explanations of the trophies eas really well done
[1:50:08] nabber_idgaf: you wouldd know if you listened to the dialog
[1:50:39] Darleksec64: i think the youtube video woukd be better if you had your top off at somepoint
[1:50:44] MoneyTwit: KEKW
[1:50:45] jazmineerose: shoot it from in the car, drive by them
[1:50:45] goontaw: KEKW
[1:51:03] mahum_4848: maybe for the YouTube vid do it in different parts like a part 1 vid and part 2 video
[1:51:08] captinkempo: the outro song is nostalgic can i get some trues
[1:51:09] gamblegambit06: so fucking close to 800k
[1:51:16] lovelypho: how far through are you now ?
[1:51:19] OzzyOzalp: @darleksec64 now that would be million views
[1:51:33] gamblegambit06: truers
[1:51:34] Darleksec64: you need to do the outro music
[1:51:40] noxylane: @mahum_4848 yeah i felt the length of the vid was a bit intimidating
[1:51:41] Nightbot: Want more Cray in your Day? Check out YouTube: youtube.com/user/crayator
[1:51:48] James_Lick: pog ye
[1:51:48] Darleksec64: yes

[1:51:57] captinkempo: crayHeyBaby
[1:52:01] OzzyOzalp: yeah mate bro love all the way
[1:52:08] prezz14: can you use kilometers instead of miles its lowkey pissing me off
[1:52:11] mahum_4848: @noxylane yea and more funny bits can be added to the vids
[1:52:18] cultoftahiti: Personally I LOVE hour long videos, but I think the algorithm favours shorter videos (under 30 mins)
[1:52:37] Remssiii: i think dividing that video into 3 parts would be beneficial
[1:52:38] noxylane: NODDERS
[1:52:50] WattiesSauce: FeelsStrongMan Good
[1:52:53] noxylane: tiktok has ruined my attention span pepeLaugh
[1:52:55] Darleksec64: dont you noramlly have chat on screen?
[1:53:00] Remssiii: Each video lets say like 15 mins
[1:53:05] captinkempo: well i'll say a lot of my algorithm is long form
[1:53:07] Remssiii: i love parts
[1:53:10] ErnieSKZ: I feel parts require consistency
[1:53:16] ughitssophie: NOOO i love long vids
[1:53:17] oxygenIess: I definitely think you could have milked the red dead redemption achievement thing for a few weeks.
[1:53:19] gamblegambit06: the more vids the more u learn i suppose
[1:53:21] professortrent1: I like 30ish mins just like a tv episode
[1:53:22] captinkempo: ALSO LET ME SAY THIS Awesome thumbnail
[1:53:24] Remssiii: its gives you a cliffhanger and makes you want to click the next video
[1:53:24] april_o104: I like 20-30min parts
[1:53:29] BRUCE_Said: Would you go on Kyootbot's dating show??
[1:53:31] JesseMoe: nw i like it SNIFFA
[1:53:31] fruitinmymouth: keeps the viviewer coming back and subbing to see next one
[1:53:33] lucas1oo1: more parts wuold mean more room for story
[1:53:34] OzzyOzalp: i was just about to say that i personally like it hours of content in one video but with the youtube algorithm you should maybe turn it to parts
[1:53:49] its_c29: I like long vids because I get to watch more of my favorite creators rather than having to wait a week for another vid
[1:53:51] rsyncd: mlem
[1:53:52] TheSnarkasaurus: Try both: a long form and 2-3parts to see the view difference
[1:54:10] jazmineerose: equip silencer weapon
[1:54:15] jazmineerose: press left button
[1:54:19] the_unusual_mullet: nah less scripting is better makes it more real you know. just my opinion tho
[1:54:20] jazmineerose: square? idk
[1:54:23] WattiesSauce: NODDERS It needs to focus on the journey of the plats, rather than the outcomes of getting the plats
[1:54:27] jazmineerose: wait are u ps or xbox
[1:54:29] boredbz: my eyess aaaa
[1:54:30] Darleksec64: i like the long videos
[1:54:30] ughitssophie: @crayator would you consider the 'story' of trophy hunting in one vid then have like a bloopers/funny moments vid too?
[1:54:37] oxygenIess: @jazmineerose ps
[1:54:45] MoneyTwit: I wish you showed more of what happened while playing instead of what the trophy is and then cuts to the moment you got it
[1:55:08] the_unusual_mullet: I wish you had a vods channel cos it sucks not being able to go back and see the full streams
[1:55:09] bear11k: hey
[1:55:12] Remssiii: NODDERS rdr was a hard grind
[1:55:13] OzzyOzalp: LOL
[1:55:14] WattiesSauce: NODDERS As the video is now, it's more a collection of 50 shorts
[1:55:16] jazmineerose: oh my
[1:55:17] rsyncd: Make the whacky moments into YT shorts Insta reels and Tuktuk videos Crayator mhm
[1:55:20] Bluebaggers_95: D:
[1:55:21] Nightbot: D: 🖕
[1:55:23] oxygenIess: Maybe get your structure down a bit more before doing a GTA V video? GTAV achievements always do great in the algorithm, so you wanna make sure you have it down
[1:55:25] OzzyOzalp: thats a bit rude for the guy innit
[1:55:26] gamblegambit06: i reckon trial em out the different ways i mean
[1:55:28] Darleksec64: the longer the videos the better
[1:55:36] BRUCE_Said: I don't have time to Hero right now
[1:55:54] ieuanphillips33: like PewDiePie did with his zero deaths run
[1:55:57] Remssiii: yeah
[1:55:59] the_unusual_mullet: im looking foward to seeing the gta a vid now cos I missed out on alot of the streams for this
[1:56:07] oxygenIess: well, 12 minutes is great. Most videos are 10 minutes, I think it's just too long.
[1:56:11] rsyncd: Tuktuk generation has a limit NODDERS
[1:56:16] mahum_4848: true
[1:56:17] noxylane: yeah
[1:56:20] jazmineerose: just split it up
[1:56:23] jazmineerose: and post them over time
[1:56:23] YaBoyNoskii: use it as lessons moreso dude
[1:56:27] MoneyTwit: I'm sure as you keep uploading those the viewers will filter out
[1:56:28] jazmineerose: people will wait for videos
[1:56:29] dat_b0i_augi: Fax it's not overnight
[1:56:30] j0hnknee: Can we play a game and take a shot whenever Cray says "you know what I mean?"
[1:56:30] jazmineerose: and come back
[1:56:36] the_unusual_mullet: its been like 2 yeaes since the last upload or something
[1:56:37] Remssiii: most people statistically tends to click off a video after 10 - 15 mins. but you uploaded in a year so there’s a difference for sure.
[1:56:39] rsyncd: Also most of those viewers are probably Fortnite era subs... it'll settle down
[1:56:44] WattiesSauce: NODDERS
[1:56:48] professortrent1: the younger generations attention span is soo short that’s why tik tok  and instagram reels are so popular
[1:56:48] ErnieSKZ: consistency is key
[1:56:50] HUMANBROCKSTRING: I ain’t watching a video over a minute
[1:56:54] YaBoyNoskii: as long as your improve for the next one!
[1:56:56] HUMANBROCKSTRING: I’m kidding
[1:56:59] ErnieSKZ: you're feeding youre viewers
[1:57:04] captinkempo: what about a 20 minute video uploaded all in one week
[1:57:07] fruitinmymouth: i know because i watch streams, but it doesn't really seem like it was as grindy or hard as it really was
[1:57:10] jazmineerose: @Crayator try split them up into parts and upload them over time so poeople come back for next videos
[1:57:13] MoneyTwit: last one POGGERS
[1:57:13] the_unusual_mullet: Blow the last one up lol
[1:57:29] rsyncd: very very very clippable NODDERS
[1:57:34] Remssiii: thats a good idea
[1:57:36] Bluebaggers_95: NODDERS
[1:57:39] gamblegambit06: i think theres audiences for both long n short i think the priority is whatever makes that BAG
[1:57:40] ErnieSKZ: you're good a reacting at moments when you game
[1:57:44] professortrent1: most clippable streamer
[1:57:44] april_o104: I love a cray clip
[1:57:45] Remssiii: people love the short clips
[1:57:47] jazmineerose: def take advantage of shorts
[1:57:47] OzzyOzalp: you should also upload videos of you reacting to stuff like maybe sidemen or the things you like just to get your viewer count up again after a long time
[1:57:48] WattiesSauce: NODDERS Quantity over quality of clips
[1:57:51] oxygenIess: you tiktok does shockingly well
[1:57:52] Remssiii: quick and easy
[1:57:53] the_unusual_mullet: Are you gonna re upload those other 100% vids to crayator i think you should
[1:57:59] parthloll: yeah you could go viral easily
[1:57:59] MoneyTwit: you already have one it's dailydoseofcrayator
[1:58:00] dat_b0i_augi: The red dead video has a lot of clippable stuff
[1:58:01] onixpectedd: NODDERS
