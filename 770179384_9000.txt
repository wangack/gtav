[2:57:49] Thayar: At least it is quite close
[2:58:04] Wunderud: This is why you don't go to war with the empire
[2:58:22] Wunderud: It's Ben's job to keep them in check
[2:58:29] DarkSnideOfTheRainbow: They call him trivia tom
[2:58:32] PiousSkeleton: You guys need to get the No Anti-Player Mod. It fixes dumb AI targeting you when they have more pressing concerns.
[2:58:39] RufusTheHairyCatWrangler: Do you think that when they are reversing the steam tank they are required to have someone sitting on the back shouting 'beeeep, beeeep, beeeep'?

[2:59:47] Wunderud: That imperial authority hurts me
[2:59:55] Thjumus: The bit of Viking trivia I like the most is this bit about the English saying something along the lines of "We need to kick em out bc our wives prefer them over us, with their perfumes and bathing and manners"

[3:01:16] rixuraxu: all the viking's good steel was imported crucible steel from the east
[3:01:32] Khyron44: Isn't Marius the Mad Count?
[3:01:48] DarkSnideOfTheRainbow: @harra_hara I think the original quote thjumus was talking about spoke specifically about danes
[3:02:03] StrangeMutant: if you appoint a new elector count you should get an imperial authority point back

[3:29:00] Threepwind: yeah its a huge timesink
[3:29:01] DarkSnideOfTheRainbow: MH is very much a grindy game

[3:29:44] WildScoosh: you could probably get through low rank in like 30 ish hours its only grindy if you go for the higher teir stuff
[3:29:55] Imperator_Benny: it's also got terribly game design and UX
[3:30:09] Threepwind: Yeah the UX sucks
[3:30:13] crudecyrus: It is far less grindy since the Icebourne expansion.
[3:30:13] Imperator_Benny: you constantly have to run all over the goddamn place to do a thing and then back to another place to do another thing

[3:32:35] Imperator_Benny: @Frooba3 the actual moment of fighting wasn't terrible, but getting to that point, the tracking system, the crafting and currencies, just fuck all that

[3:33:15] Imperator_Benny: @wazzatwazzit exactly. and that made it that much worse. it *could* have been amazing, but they made it just a constant dick punch to actually play
[3:33:32] Imperator_Benny: worst inventory management clusterfuck literally ever
[3:33:43] Imperator_Benny: or anyway since skyrim, but at least skyrim got mods
[3:34:04] wazzatwazzit: @Imperator_Benny exactly, it feels like a soulless husk of an elder scrolls game and then adds tedium into the mix with all the management of your skills and inventory
[3:34:12] Frooba3: @imperator_benny Tracking them? It's find footprints. What else would you expect? The crafting and currency come down to preference definitely, not even gonna touch those.
[3:34:59] Imperator_Benny: @Frooba3 yeah, it felt real fiddly still. i'd rather have been able to just wander around and not have to track anything ever. but again, that's me. just because i hated it doesn't mean other people should. but i hated it lol

[3:36:11] Frooba3: @imperator_benny Oh no, I totally get that. I was just wondering what you expected or how you'd change it. Everyone is free to their opinions! yogR
[3:36:12] TheSpaceDinosaur: TheSpaceDinosaur subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months! Always happy to catch a Tom and Ben stream!
[3:36:12] Diamon_Boots: Cataphrom
[3:36:17] Imperator_Benny: @szethw haha, they asked the same question, just showed up :)
[3:36:20] Deathwing_reborn: they decided to let nordland suceed from the empire
[3:36:25] Prossaug: So basically make a gargant?
[3:36:32] Diamon_Boots: Basically a Lord of Skulls?
[3:36:36] Deathwing_reborn: and they showed up since its the AI
[3:36:49] DarkSnideOfTheRainbow: Maybe like an armored giant with kytan top?
[3:36:52] Deathwing_reborn: there pretty gun ho when it comes to player hunting
[3:37:09] Prossaug: A sister of battle top with goblin legs?
[3:37:30] szethw: Gausser is channeling his inner Toddy
[3:37:46] DarkSnideOfTheRainbow: @Prossaug goblin legs on stilts to fit in the power armro
[3:37:46] TrowellingBadger: Love me some Frostgrave.
[3:38:00] MagWolf11: Im dyslexic apparently cause I red that as an armored giant with a Karen on top

[3:38:07] Funkyoogaman: rip
[3:38:09] Markreivi: RIP Kislev
[3:38:50] Imperator_Benny: @Frooba3 fair point... i guess i dunno what i expected. i guess ulitmately it felt like i spent a lot less time fighting monsters than Doing Other (tedious / opaque / time consuming) Filler Stuff.
[3:38:54] Deathwing_reborn: doesnt matter chaos doesnt get out of kislev even if their dead
[3:38:57] CmdrRob: F in chat for kislev.
[3:39:02] Deathwing_reborn: there*
[3:39:26] Deathwing_reborn: oh god
[3:39:55] pastabus_: manfred is kicking in yo shit
[3:40:00] Imperator_Benny: truthfully it was kind of an important step to my realizing that actually i just don't like MMORPGs, and also don't like most computer RPGs, which was a difficult and counterintuitive realization
[3:40:18] Wunderud: KisleF
[3:40:25] Frooba3: @imperator_benny Fair enough. I have a similar issue with Dark Souls (because I suck, and get lost).

[3:41:25] SierraKomodo: Aaaa the yogs store went down
[3:41:39] Hamback: I usually see Karl make a huge comeback from turn 50-60 once he gobbles up a smaller empire faction
[3:41:43] Frooba3: @imperator_benny But now you know, and you don't have to waste time and money on those games! yogR
[3:41:44] drakegard: !merch
[3:41:44] JaffaMod: Check out the Yogscast Merch Store at http://store.yogscast.com !
[3:41:49] Imperator_Benny: @Frooba3 yeah, i can see that. i find it much more tolerable in Dark Souls (& similar) because it's single player, and i treat single player games as basically just wank time anyway. if i'm playing with friends, which is rare and special time, i want to get the most out of it.

[3:43:01] Diamon_Boots: I had a birthday party just before the rona hit
[3:43:04] power_corveus: And post christmas
[3:43:14] Imperator_Benny: @Frooba3 @tracer_but_with_alcohol this is me too... there are so many games i love to watch but would hate to play myself.
[3:43:14] Diamon_Boots: Last party we had here

[3:44:06] Imperator_Benny: I'm in that camp too. People ask what i want to do for my birthday and it's impossible to politely say what i want to say which is "Uh, spend the whole day playing games and drinking with no one else around and without ANY judgement."

[3:49:03] Rshiel_: I feel like thatâ€™s happened a few times... :P
[3:49:13] KXT420: the sekiro first boss is a good example of a failed fight done right
[3:49:14] spookyskylark: the cultists from Dawn of War
[3:49:16] RufusTheHairyCatWrangler: or at least make it so you are supposed to lose but can win if you're good enough, like in Sekiro
[3:49:26] Frooba3: The fight until we lose thing sounds like a good short story.
[3:49:38] Stefnos: @Yogscast can cultist sound like officer Biro?
