[1:26:04] datascribe: Definitely
[1:26:11] VSDuck: sniffthenewchatter
[1:26:17] JediJacob_: it would have stuck 100%
[1:26:27] SpicyIRamen: Wait who threatened with a dap?
[1:26:28] VSDuck: looking at it from all angles it should have stuck
[1:26:33] notthatlizardguy: Can you push First Degree Murder for me? I have too many DAPs
[1:26:41] Barathak: only way it doesn't stick is on a technicality imo
[1:26:42] diamond_inv: hey custard,love you and marley’s content bro
[1:26:43] marneraiders: It just has to be articulated very very well
[1:26:49] VSDuck: @notthatlizardguy AAAA
[1:26:51] FastEddeh: based on how the officer was articulating it wouldnt have because they said they weren't sure the people were in the bank
[1:26:53] killergoat20: He threatened d it it going against ruby and slacks order
[1:27:14] datascribe: i dont know about the bench trial outcome but the if this doesnt happen then you get dap is very slippery
[1:27:22] TheBFG_01: agreed, it’s the banks money, G6 are just moving it from one location, to another
[1:27:28] bobdang07hd: Theres a lot more to it i saw most of it, the conversation with slacks will be good to see though
[1:27:29] jman_sucks: its marked Gruppe 6 its not the banks cash thats what was said to maple
[1:27:38] Silence5405: sniffthenewchatter
[1:27:39] marneraiders: Rohbing the money on the Bank property => sounds like „robbing of a financial institution“
[1:27:50] FastEddeh: its not the banks money until the bank has it, at the time it's robbed it's responsible to the transport company
[1:27:51] Danination: and even if the charge hadn't stuck, it's points in time like that where you build up reason behind change in the system.
[1:27:59] timedoggg: All trucks go to the vault at some point. Is that argument going to be useed when they get robbed at the dock?
[1:28:24] AndresSaysHey: Bell gives me Remington vibes on how to tow the line on how to articulate things very well
[1:28:26] FastEddeh: @timedoggg this is how it would be knocked down, it would've absolutely not stuck
[1:28:27] jman_sucks: it wouldve been a intresting case for sure
[1:28:29] notthatlizardguy: If anything. It reflects poorly on Slaaks for not back his officers.
[1:28:35] skinnylegend000: even if the charge didn’t stick pointing out the wording and getting it denied at bench is just as much progress as a guilty blverdict.
[1:28:38] notthatlizardguy: Backing
[1:28:41] VSDuck: That's what I was asking yesterday if a G6 truck has money marked for a bank or the vault is it considered a financial institution while it has said money?
[1:28:47] SanchoPanza49: Do you think meta played a factor?
[1:28:49] datascribe: monkaHands
[1:28:53] sBuon: I think it was because he said not to push it so it would be a DAP against the change of command

[1:29:21] random_viewer_55: the coc

[1:29:30] Wheez_3D: Ramee was the lawyer there so made the officers doubt themselves also
[1:29:30] jman_sucks: yeah it would be a DAP for not listening to command

[6:19:50] sBuon: I just got a sudden craving for chicken alfredo
[6:19:53] LogicWeasel: it was loud and awful, I blame Ramee's games for that
[6:19:53] RobialT: Officers were there cause they still had phones LUL
[6:19:56] thaGrandpoobah88: shouldn't you have taken ramee's phone when you first brought him down?

[6:20:00] themanwithanrx7: it was a full shitshow with too many people
[6:20:02] Encryptic: Ramee was trying to distract everyone to keep his phone.
[6:20:03] Wallsh_: Ramee just refuses to comply.  That's his chracter
[6:20:24] random_viewer_55: get Ramee for witness tampering peepoEvil

[6:20:33] Luthercorpz: Just lose it until ppl give up
[6:20:56] Wallsh_: Ramee just yells and created confusion amongst the cops
[6:20:56] Kiwo: some cops just need lawyer training
[6:20:56] themanwithanrx7: how did Ramee even get to her, shouldn't all those doors be locked
[6:21:03] Wallsh_: creates*
[6:21:04] d00b3rr: @Ikilledkenny91 and they need to be enforced consistently

[6:21:09] ComplexPandaSinger: yes its true, as i saw the only one who was escalating is Ramee but what ever
[6:21:14] Agpenny: She shouldn't have been in there before the line up was ready especially if Jean Paul was on the other side on his own
[6:21:16] KDRaid: oh no what happened?
[6:21:17] Kiwo: and the beauty of lawyers is that you don't have to agree to their pleas LUL
[6:21:27] d00b3rr: @Agpenny yeah tainted line up

[6:21:38] OddSwizzle: @Kiwo BasedGod
[6:21:42] random_viewer_55: @Kiwo amen
[6:21:50] 1CaptainRedBeard1: I mean, I kind of feel for Cornwood in this. He was the one who was actually confused as to why they had their phones in the first place.
[6:22:01] Wheez_3D: How did ramee get into the viewing room alone with the victim? Cause that is wild
[6:22:02] 1CaptainRedBeard1: But in classic Cornwood fashion, gets dragged in. KEKW
[6:22:10] buddha_hands: I think people give ramos allowances sometimes (like the phone) to avoid the hassle but that has down sides PeepoGiggles
[6:22:16] Luthercorpz: Maybe Kit should have deal with Ramee since she was primary no?
[6:22:23] Luthercorpz: dealt^
[6:22:35] Luthercorpz: Ah true
[6:22:38] Kiwo: Scene lead was disrespected
[6:22:42] Wallsh_: The cell phone thing needs to be communicated to the whole Department or something
[6:22:48] d00b3rr: @buddha_hands but plenty of lawyers get to keep their phones. siobahn allmost never has hers taken
[6:22:59] bygodwest: people already spend 4 hours on reports
[6:23:04] buddha_hands: @d00b3rr just an example

[6:23:58] bygodwest: her comment about people rushing and not taking enough time. Not that they should be rushed to where it causes errors but jesus the report part of this takes forever

[6:24:46] buddha_hands: @d00b3rr you may not realize how far he pushes boundaries PeepoGiggles
[6:24:49] DiaBeetusKoby: @bygodwest EZ just don’t do crime if you don’t want to deal with the time..
[6:24:58] kaizynh: kinda surprised you guys didn't just seize all the materials as evidence. they can petition to receive them back
[6:25:02] dapyman: Archer looking out for criminal boyfriend #2. LoL

[6:26:52] RobialT: Is Ramee not turning over the hpone not an issue tho?
[6:26:52] Rayvohs: ramee wouldnt have been cuffed if kian took his phone at the start Kappa
[6:27:02] spookyghost21: Archer is too pure for this world
[6:27:12] d00b3rr: @RobialT he asked for proof it was supposed to be taken and it was not provided
[6:27:15] RobialT: JP had a phone too
[6:27:33] Kiwo: oh Maisy doesn't like her LUL
[6:27:34] sBuon: @RobialT that's because they had to put his stuff back on him
