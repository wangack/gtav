[0:53:45] realitijd24: so funny that you both chose cypress good for info
[0:53:50] TastyKudzu: It seems like they want conflict to be more RP based instead of needing to secure a mechanic so that's pretty cool.

[1:04:15] lyfmobile: @bowflexing no it was 1 x checked his vod
[1:04:18] juicexgx: @bowflexing its 1 but coin to make the name and 10 to change it if you want to change it
[1:04:20] Babushka_82: @bluecifer69 yea couple of times in snr buns

[1:04:44] bluecifer69: @babushka_82 , thank you for that. :)
[1:04:45] bowflexing: I think it said 10 but was only 1 then
[1:04:53] fondledongle: XQC's face when he saw it was 1 coin OMEGALAUGHING
[1:04:55] DangersClose: that vagos fldefended him
[1:04:57] VADICKUS007: whats your strain name?
[1:05:01] Chimpie360: how much has speedy made today chat?
[1:05:07] fondledongle: It wasnt 10, xqc was just cooked and misread
[1:05:08] Landarokz: It said 10 but X never confirmed it took 10 lol
[1:05:10] DangersClose: the vagos shot that lady and defended him
[1:05:13] juicexgx: because he hates not being first
[1:05:19] ctsblindsniper: Butt machines HUH
[1:05:19] quote_me_if_horsen: 10 to change strain name
[1:05:25] juicexgx: finding out he didnt actually take the turf first hurt him
[1:05:32] Teddsan: its 1 to set the name 10 to change it
[1:05:36] TropicalToucan: Watching Ray talk to X about the situation before meeting with Lang. It was like Lang had foretold a prophecy because he read x like a book LUL I was crying

[1:06:22] RobLeezy810: And Octo and Tony love the cleaning. It's nice and spread out
[1:06:37] juicexgx: @bowflexing naming your weed shouldnt cost 10 though it makes sense for it not to be 10
[1:06:48] lyfmobile: @bowflexing because it was confusing, it said it requires 10 bc to change name not make the thing
[1:07:02] juicexgx: if cops somehow find out you're the one growing the strain it costs 10 to change name so you get the heat off
[1:07:03] bluecifer69: @robleezy810 Buddha's crew has a structure than other crews, loved that

[4:47:36] sugapie: KJ potentially a vibe
[4:47:38] lettuceleaf222: can you have two growers of same strain?
[4:47:38] TastyKudzu: I think the 12 slots on the app might be an issue. Because you need to be on it to do robberies and stuff too...
[4:47:40] derpysmurf123: need more drying and washing machine
[4:47:40] leithdevil: we got half the server
[4:47:48] KentKLS: @SayeedBlack Si eu too probalby could be around to help you no ?
[4:47:50] Axy_p: @lettuceleaf222 yes, if they get the seeds
[4:47:52] lyfmobile: you need people in your timezone tbh
[4:47:52] Brodoswagings: it will take some time for Si to get 100 tho, he doing it slow and stealthy LUL
[4:47:59] Babushka_82: KEKL KEKL KEKL
[4:48:00] bonkiloni: it’s really fun tho the process of growing
[4:48:10] Shunne93: Yes, they just like to sound smart
[4:48:10] nekkoxxx: yes
[4:48:13] Shunne93: When they talk to you
[4:48:13] saleh1331: but its harry
[4:48:14] MLG91_: LUL
[4:48:16] Shunne93: But they do way worse
[4:48:19] Jocke124: its the other people not knowing each other
[4:48:21] AlexanderMichael: classic
[4:48:23] xy02x: u do know growers don't need to be in the group besides Harry
[4:48:23] qualia07: i think the buy in thing is different
[4:48:25] badguyzrules: It was his test
[4:48:25] 9Rux: maybe speedy should bring that topic in the meeting
[4:48:27] scarthy: He is Harry's vouch though
[4:48:30] Niktory: I don’t think Ilya knows he pushes
[4:48:31] Babushka_82: rule dosnt apply for hary or lang KEKWTF
[4:48:34] Sl33pyJinn: i think they said in the future
[4:48:34] Niktory: I mean grows
[4:48:39] demndia: it was harry's guy before they figured out that they want to keep growing/pushing seperate
[4:48:40] SwaxwellSilver: par for the course lol
[4:48:40] calidagoat: then maybe speak up about it lol
[4:48:45] Shunne93: @Babushka_82 This LMAO
[4:48:49] saleh1331: the point is so they dont fuck you and go behind you back and work togther
[4:48:58] xavytrabajar: Rules for thee and not for me with Lang lol its always been that way lol
[4:49:05] Niktory: Ilya prolly assumes Harry grows but I don’t think he’s told him directly
[4:49:05] TastyKudzu: Well but Harry is the one bringing in Ilya so if Ilya rolls on him then its Harry's fault. But Harry might not know the other pushers like that.
[4:49:06] qvbxx: yh they always 2 sided with speedy
[4:49:08] xavytrabajar: Just part of the character lol
[4:49:09] Creadate: I don't think Harry told him that he is grower, did he?
[4:49:13] Sircs_: It's a looser set of rules for the dons i guess
[4:49:17] Shunne93: @saleh1331 The point is that they yap but they don't keep things separate themselves
[4:49:20] saliromeo: Harry had the same idea as Speedy about having people under him specifically
[4:49:28] badguyzrules: Harry wanted to test illya and see if he was capable and trustworthy
[4:49:39] Sircs_: which makes sense for nuances
[4:49:48] 9Rux: 45? sheeesh
[4:49:50] awesomephilip11: 6 reps for 15/15
[4:49:54] saliromeo: dayuum
[4:50:05] OV3RFLOWx: The crew is still lacking in the fence guy. Harry Is like 50 but it could be one of those days like yesterday and now the crew would have no one in 100 rep and behind like the company is with weed
[4:50:45] 9Rux: i wonder what's the next unlock after this, devs really cooked
[4:50:49] TastyKudzu: Yeah. They need to get a big group and just rob G6 and Grime. But they never group up like that.
[4:50:59] awesomephilip11: @OV3RFLOWx yep, harry got 60 when he ended stream last night. He's near. (y)
[4:51:00] Shunne93: @OV3RFLOWx I don't think they care much about being behind the company or not tbf
[4:51:17] OV3RFLOWx: @shunne93 that's a good point
[4:51:27] StreamElements: Join our discord server and hangout with the community! https://discord.gg/bV7qvG4
[4:51:33] redhoodsquad: Everything in good time, I don't think anyone should care about being first or ahead
[4:51:47] 9Rux: true
[4:51:52] TastyKudzu: It's not about being behind the company though. The issue is that if suddenly that rep is needed it's going to become impossible to find bags or to rob G6 / Grime. Cops will be on high alert, etc. Because suddenly tons of groups will need packages.

[5:00:06] lilzuckerberg1: @9Rux yeah but 4.0 has a lot more shit than 3.0 so more things can bug out
[5:00:06] TastyKudzu: I hope that the first guns are real shit and that you have to craft a fuck ton of them to get a better gun BP.
[5:00:07] reichenbachs: legal license should still be 50k
