[4:20:50] Sablotron: I'll always have that fond memory of the early 3.0 clip of DW saying he had setup "dedicated logging" for buddha's SID and still couldn't figure out how the scuff constantly followed him.
[4:21:26] JabbaDaHutts: @Harry Maybe put the thing in the middle of a room and not the edge, it might be that you are putting the thing in the void
[4:21:48] XCronoX79: does the panel have to be touching the wall? cause it looks like there’s a tiny gap
[4:21:48] PrimeSlime__: one of the problem is the house also ain't sound proof

[4:24:10] scotty2thotty18: @itskvn__ yes. Everyone has a non soundproof house or apartment
[4:24:28] MrVlume: maybe the house needs to be empty
[4:25:00] HHdrummer: undo
[4:25:01] its_ajc: i think you only place that using 2 points
[4:25:38] ishouldprobably: I feel like you would have to deduce whether it's a box specific issue., a house location specific issue or a harry specific issue

[6:14:54] davido_labido: like, it's not great
[6:14:57] ezionile: well US is still about 25-30 depending on how much u earn and then Social security and medicare as well so prob >30

[6:15:42] Mugenshippai: but Harry if you are making enough to the point that you are getting up in the higher tax brackets in the UK you can set up an LLC and get it down to 19% sure you will have some admin costs but will still be lower in the end as well as have more options when it comes to tax write offs
[6:15:43] deadpaint_tm: the problem with taxes in the US is how much corporations get away with not paying. and don’t get me started on religious organizations
[6:15:47] TomGreek1980: I'm from Canada and I one time sneezed the wrong way and a doctor saw me right away.

[6:15:56] mr_e74: he 50% tax is only for over 50k tho 👌
[6:15:56] robot_pirates: but yeah
[6:15:57] FreshPosty: @davido_labido agreed, but thats if you work for a company. if you work for yourself you can pay alot less tax
[6:16:03] davido_labido: but that's only if you get over £125k and then it's 45% on whatever you earn over 125k.
[6:16:04] EnjoiHunt: @bird24287 I didn't have it for like 10 years. But my leg had been killing me. Got it again and apparently I have avascular necrosis. So that means one day sooner than later I'll need a hip replacement. I'm only 30. Lol So i gotta pay it until that happens

[6:16:37] youthedog4: yeah but healthcare in the us can cause people to spend $4-5k before they even hit their deductible and even then, still have to pay lol

[6:16:58] herr_line: is that income tax? or includes social contributions etc?
[6:16:59] scoobiesnacs: I love how everyone's a tax expert in here
[6:16:59] natediggitty__: I live by the d.i.n.k method
[6:17:00] sosjy: but if you earn that much to be at the 55% rate, does like 200£ difference a month really matter to you anymore ?
[6:17:11] dirtyjuice91: Lord harrington
[6:17:28] bybuckets: to me the issue is that in the US, once you hit over like 550-700k depending, you pay the same % as someone making 500 million
[6:17:41] machineYearning: @harry including state income tax, federal income tax, social security, Medicare, and private health insurance I still pay close to 45% in the USA

[8:47:02] OriginalGibsta: I just don't see how buying at 3 is sustainable, but it's classic Lang
[8:47:08] tannerrobbz: That’s a good come up!!
[8:47:08] ProngsAedan: It's better lang is paying 3.50. Because if Harry buys for 3 and sells for 4, then gives a % to Lang. It's more work.
[8:47:18] Degenerate: LOL
[8:47:23] leswes17: Yep lol

Lang to start buyin mats from Harr so he can make a profit & pay his own 10k weekly. Harr shanked Sr Bun wrker for spittin in Langs burger. Boys jumped & shanked Booblay at the yard.

[11:37:09] Dark_Eyes32: have you guys kept track of material prices for furnishing the house? Or just take all the walls and shit with you
[11:37:12] bigxfisch: @ViableTV it reminded me alot of valheim, not as many building options but your base can get raided and you need to harvest everything
[11:37:13] porkx: buddhaWW
[11:37:16] fenixblac: PalWorld?!?! are y’all serious???
[11:37:20] mhmLuca: does the house get like sold back to the ‘“market” or do you sell it to other people
