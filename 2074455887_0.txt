[3:57:38] capybarastare: Frick gold
[3:57:50] dogassratz: i replaced my power supply but still no juice going through it so most likely mother board is gone...
[3:58:01] Piperken: @Zach_Christy Like a rice paper spring roll, but heavier
[3:58:11] FickleTickler: @TurismoKing89 yea i'm surprised tbh lol but i usually take pretty good care of my shit to make it last
[3:58:14] suebae: I find it crazy how nowadays people just buy a new PC when something is wrong instead of fixing it
[3:58:23] FickleTickler: but with all these newer games i can barely handle them
[3:58:24] PuffyChocolatee: @Shad0w_wizard My family got sick
[3:58:50] Shad0w_wizard: @PuffyChocolatee bruh that's how I got mine KEKW my mom was sick now me and my dad are lmao

[3:59:11] jumpingdonuts: @suebae I don't think that's a new thing per say. It more dependent on how tech savy and hands on a person is willing to be.
[3:59:16] HolyPancakesTV: np. thank tony for being so kool
[3:59:23] Chineeman: 😷 stay away chat
[3:59:29] TurismoKing89: @suebae I built mine in 2020 and its been cleaned regularly and well cared for and I think my mobo is dying already(ASUS board)
[3:59:43] DEagleEye: @shad0w_wizard u really shldbt be taking antibiotics for a cold, colds are virus's it dsnt help and your just building antibiotic resistance
[3:59:46] PuffyChocolatee: @Shad0w_wizard My mom got covid from my brother o7 but we took vitamin c stuff to drink and I didn't get sick
[3:59:52] suebae: @jumpingdonuts maybe not Everyone but I do think streamers especially I've seen it a lot
[3:59:54] icecold_nl: geegaUndead
[3:59:56] mu5h1e: chat looking extra cute today
[4:00:07] yol0_kamikaze: lebronJAM
[4:00:21] dogassratz: @TurismoKing89 yeah mine was about the same time and yeah pretty sure its mother board or processor is gone..
[4:00:27] PuffyChocolatee: classic
[4:00:29] Shad0w_wizard: @PuffyChocolatee damn that's smart lmao I been meaning to start taking vitamin c and other vitamins regularly just gotta get into the habit
[4:00:34] jumpingdonuts: classic tony
[4:00:38] capybarastare: I got a cold plus the stress of my job made me feel like dying this time of the year is rough

[4:01:24] nathanl314: tony moved back down to pounder?
[4:01:28] dogassratz: LUL
[4:01:39] jumpingdonuts: @suebae once again it depends on person, remeber streamers are just like us effectively. Some aren't good with hands on stuff or computers and that's fine, for them its easier to just pay more to get something that works then spend time trying to figure out what is wrong and fix it
[4:01:53] PuffyChocolatee: Chatting
[4:01:55] suebae: @turismoking89 damn that sucks yeah if it's the mobo then you kinda have to start all over unless you replace it with the exact same one

[4:02:34] TurismoKing89: @suebae Finding the same one is ridiculous, I can get a newer board cheaper.
[4:02:36] suebae: @jumpingdonuts that's understandable
[4:02:45] PuffyChocolatee: @jumpingdonuts Its a good convo KEK
