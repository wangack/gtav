[5:34:50] Sky_Tortoise: @Vauss there is a rule about them putting the public at risk. so yes. if a chase has been going for over 15 in my eyes and theyre not a free way. but going through side walks and all other things yes lethal should be an option. maybe not to kill. but to shoot their tires as the least and then knight stick em

[5:38:21] HavocusRex: seems like it'd be safe to assume everything is stolen till proven otherwise right?
[5:38:28] AlindBack: How long between the call and the chase? Was it long enough for somebody to shift a ton of HVAC gear into the car?
[5:38:30] Lordbidwell: 100% agreed

[5:41:55] K00PAD00P: @Vikairius depends on who you are though. For a Pawn Star? maybe not
[5:42:02] Lordbidwell: Yeah you would seize it and the lawyer would need to prove it wasn't used in the crime
[5:42:21] Wiidiis: I don‚Äôt get how just claiming your car was stolen absolves you of everything

[6:20:19] XCptBonesX: know Gomer not into robbing civs but sure there something you can do. maybe help Chodes with the weed
[6:20:24] Splitcookie713: the shop isn‚Äôt happening tho according to binny
[6:20:25] SparkPJ: did you hear about the business license stuff?
[6:20:29] Lepaca: "also, give us all your money for us to have fun with"
[6:20:30] MysteryFran: wasn‚Äôt worth the money for business license and fines for anything
[6:20:36] Carmine_steel: Business license legislation
[6:20:39] emrejonson: bussiness licences, no state help, no atm machine
[6:20:43] Ragingbumblebee: no something to do with the government
[6:20:48] ShadowSithBane: The council or eight anti rp'ers made the businesses suck
[6:20:56] Nutthouze_Penguin: Yeah Vinny kinda got fucked
[6:20:58] viewlessd: @ShadowSithBane u are stupid
[6:21:00] viewlessd: KEKW
[6:21:08] Lordbidwell: timmacFP
[6:21:14] viewlessd: its not that
[6:21:14] MysteryFran: like 50k for business license and 25k for a fine or something like that so he said it wasn‚Äôt worth it
[6:21:22] viewlessd: omfg KEKW
[6:21:23] SparkPJ: 50k for the license, 25k for any crime + you have 2 weeks to give up the business or the state will take it. You have to pay for everything, even an ATM near your shop
[6:21:23] Ragingbumblebee: yeah and them not helping and can take it away if he does anything illegal
[6:21:23] scarkoa: If you get a felony you lose the business to the state
[6:21:23] viewlessd: chat
[6:21:24] ShadowSithBane: @viewlessd cool! so are you!
[6:21:25] SparkPJ: its wild
[6:21:26] Jessimi: The council made it nearly impossible. 50k, and if you get in trouble, you only have 2 weeks to find someone to sell your business to or the govt seizes it.
[6:21:39] Splitcookie713: 50k for a business license. and state won‚Äôt help. like not adding atm or ability to add/remove turbos
[6:21:52] scarkoa: Business owner fitness test is the problem
[6:21:54] Jessimi: And you can only sell it to someone who has the SAME business liscense and type as you, within that 2 weeks.
[6:22:06] emrejonson: you can only transfer it to someone who has a bussiness approved or something
[6:22:19] Nutthouze_Penguin: The other person you have to pass the business off to has to pay the 50k too before the 2 weeks is up
[6:22:31] viewlessd: civs up good
[6:22:39] Jessimi: If its a restaraunt, they wont give you custom foods, etc. The Govt wont step in to help at all. Self sustain businesses only.

[6:22:50] Ragingbumblebee: tell you what dabs letting me down as mayor i was expecting fireworks not gonna lie lol
[6:22:50] xtylaw: 50k for licences no help from gov so if you want or need something then its a nope if caught for a felony you have 14days to transfer at 25k but only to someone that has been aprroved and have bussiness but that is not open so they can take over the cost of mats is threw the roof and well pll want to sell for high they dont want to pay the cost to get things fixed
[6:22:53] Carmine_steel: @Nutthouze_Penguin And be PRE approved to own a business

[6:23:19] MajorPainCA: Bigger issue is someone on the council is swaying others on the council to block certain people for businesses because their feelings were hurt in the past.
[6:23:23] Lordbidwell: Paragraph chat timmacFP
[6:23:29] SparkPJ: i think vinny wanted to be the clean front like he used to be years ago and got bored
[6:23:33] SparkPJ: lets be honest
[6:23:40] scarkoa: A single felony and not business though? I could understand after a few or something but 1 mad cop while your driving bad and instant felony
[6:23:40] Splitcookie713: A 2nd HQ app would be great for heist. could hit laundry 2 times a day with a 2nd cg crew
[6:23:44] Jessimi: Crime aside, its 50k and zero help from govt for custom assets. No ATMs, no custom foods, etc.
[6:24:07] Nutthouze_Penguin: Pretty much all business got screwed LUL
[6:24:13] emrejonson: atm is state owned
[6:24:17] Carmine_steel: because mosleys is owned by the state
[6:24:20] xtylaw: cus that is state run
[6:24:24] Nutthouze_Penguin: People going to be doing business on the low now
[6:24:24] emrejonson: mary mushkin cannot claim mosleys
[6:24:25] viewlessd: its state
[6:24:28] Lordbidwell: Chat sounds super invested.  It's okay to touch grass timmacTU
[6:24:28] StreamElements: timmacTU
[6:24:35] SirGO0SE: @majorpainca that's not true.  The only person who has any say is the mayor.
[6:24:40] MajorPainCA: @Splitcookie713 It would but you know they would have the better people on one crew and the leftover people on the other one and more likely to get caught.
[6:24:46] hvanity: A Dev wrote the legislation that way, no custom assets at all
[6:24:58] ShadowSithBane: @Lordbidwell says the 6 year sub KEKW
[6:25:01] Vikairius: I honestly think they are stalling until they are more ready
[6:25:08] emrejonson: and storage
[6:25:09] Jrd_: Tobii also did say "For now that's how it will be"  he didnt say that part would be permanent
[6:25:09] Jessimi: Lordbidwell Its just sad that business RP is getting crushed.
[6:25:20] Lordbidwell: Says the None sub
[6:25:23] Carmine_steel: yeah although the way that it's written it seems like any and all help is void and null
[6:25:29] SparkPJ: @Vikairius this is a good shout, i never thought about it like this
[6:25:37] SparkPJ: like people might be progressing faster than 4.0 wants
[6:25:39] MajorPainCA: @SirGO0SE It is true.  That person was in a "clan" with the mayor so she's swayed him.  And they soured a fee others to their side.
[6:25:39] HiimMoos3: @Lordbidwell It's almost as if they're having discussions.

[6:26:10] Splitcookie713: @majorpainca just need separate hackers. K already found a 2nd good one and Chris can hack. So all that‚Äôs needed are drivers
[6:26:11] emrejonson: yes 50k basically for a bussniness bank account
[6:26:15] Carmine_steel: yeah, it does mention a business account
[6:26:33] xtylaw: yes but ppl dont know if you can charge to the account like send bill

[6:27:07] HiimMoos3: @Lordbidwell Nah you're just being kind of weird man, people are having constructive conversations, no hate no rage, and you're telling them "Touch grass"....6 year sub btw.
[6:27:07] DanLGG: all businesses required dev assistance
[6:27:10] MajorPainCA: @Splitcookie713 And who are some of those leftover people. Paris, Carmella, Richard?

[6:28:58] viewlessd: @Timmac people would go to prison and get liek 50 of each KEKW
[6:29:02] MajorPainCA: @SirGO0SE How is it different if she swayed the mayor and 2-3 others.  That's 4-5 votes against out of the 8.
[6:29:09] Gangstagrover: yup
[6:29:18] scarkoa: Only the slushies cost money
[6:29:20] Vikairius: Yeah they found out earlier the 0 cost food can't be bought if in debt. Which is wild
[6:29:32] viewlessd: @Timmac did u hear about Cranes ide making bobby brown and carmine DOC KEKW
[6:29:33] Lordbidwell: wtf

[6:30:03] Jessimi: All these weird new laws just feel extremely stiffling. Adoption laws, business laws, etc
[6:30:13] SirGO0SE: @majorpainca I don't think you understand how it works. There is only 1 vote for businesses and its max. It's been made clear that business approval is at the sole discretion of the mayor, it does not go to a vote
[6:30:15] scarkoa: The real question is who is gossip girl ü§£

[6:32:24] Jessimi: Yeah if K and Ramee's DNA gets in the system... oooof.
[6:32:28] Carmine_steel: @SailorWS He was saved by that one part saying only law enforcment being required lol

[6:35:44] IronLion_55: they had it set twice and moved so k decided to jerk them back by moving it like they did lmao
[6:35:47] Lordbidwell: Yeah cop is time consuming in paperwork it seems
[6:35:48] Vikairius: Lawyers sometimes make it take 2-3 times as long
[6:35:52] SparkPJ: ramee is a good lawyer as well, i reckon if he gets caught he should make a character for it but idk if he's the type
[6:35:55] rastalano: esfand1 esfand2
[6:35:57] Vikairius: Basically court cases in the cells
[6:35:58] rastalano: esfand3 esfand4
[6:36:18] Carmine_steel: Esfand was talking about how the worst part about cop's is the paperwork requirements necessary
[6:36:22] Lordbidwell: Paper work rp
[6:36:45] SailorWS: I think 1 officer should write their report and if it goes to court everyone else can testify
[6:36:56] Vikairius: Too much gotcha allowed in court cases sometimes
[6:37:01] SailorWS: no need for 6 statements
[6:37:23] ghall4: That‚Äôs a much better idea
[6:37:25] Carmine_steel: would eliminate a lot of the maze that is MRPD
[6:37:26] DanLGG: I honestly think lowering the burden of proof could benefit pd. Beyond a reasonable doubt is crazy. Beyond more than likely would make PDs job easier.

[8:47:51] bala_jj_45: honestly something needs to be balanced but any rule would just piss someone off anyway. seems like a lose lose
[8:47:57] BamBamRP: @SirGO0SE i have you know, im attempting to educate myself, i still thumbs down till futher notice
[8:48:02] DanLGG: not really. there‚Äôs only a couple cars they can‚Äôt keep up with. With good turbo they do a lot better
[8:48:12] JIMarasjoehell: I remember best time for me was when you where training new cops, or when you did the mac motors races etc
[8:48:39] diabolik_lord: @bala_jj_45 balance would come with better cars to keep up, but carts in the way is just.... hard to avoid
[8:48:43] FRANKIEonPCin256PIXELS: i still miss arma
[8:48:50] SirGO0SE: Your YouTube recommends must be hella confused atpRtsd4 @bambamrp
[8:48:55] RisKkeyy: Immediate swaps is super annoying, not even fun on both sides tbh
[8:49:00] jelly_envy: yeah those swaps was hella quick
[8:49:01] FRANKIEonPCin256PIXELS: ill move on one day
[8:49:02] BamBamRP: i cant WAIT till cops finally get some balanced stuff and crims be like "FOR THIS?!"
[8:49:06] FRANKIEonPCin256PIXELS: dont rush me
[8:49:10] DanLGG: those were quick swaps. maybe the guy falling out the trunk scared them
[8:49:13] viewlessd: rule of 6 KEKW
[8:49:15] GwnYor: Gotta love speedrunners
[8:49:18] viewlessd: with 5 cops on duty
[8:49:20] Phantroneous: It's smart on their part but really cheesy in my opinion I always preferred the swaps after an attempt was made initially.
[8:49:21] Amora_xox: rip
[8:49:28] Phantroneous: But I blame summit for my taste in chases.
[8:49:34] RisKkeyy: Like what's the fun in doing the heist if ur gonna pull that shit
[8:49:54] diabolik_lord: @Phantroneous yeah, felt like farming, they could have chased a bit more imo.
[8:50:01] diabolik_lord: true , that crash sucks
[8:50:02] GewdDoogie: Arma. The old days of the made Man Timmy MacAoone
[8:50:14] jelly_envy: swaps off the rip is smart.....sometimes, but at the same time takes the fun out of the chase
[8:50:25] yaboycasper: I wil
[8:50:36] Lepaca: content and pogs for me, but not for thee
[8:50:44] SirGO0SE: It'd be cool if the next buff to PD comes through something for dispatch to do
[8:50:45] Phantroneous: I never said it was good content.
[8:50:48] jelly_envy: yeah smart isn't the right wording
[8:50:50] bala_jj_45: I mean police are getting suspended for pitting, so you already have one hand tied behind your back.
[8:50:58] Veixa: But it's important to WIN THE RP yo!!
[8:51:11] ydw2jameshunter: i think your dlss are not working
[8:51:26] jelly_envy: @bala_jj_45 thats a whole different can of worms tbh
[8:51:26] lookachef: Mergul was fun content
[8:51:35] RisKkeyy: Also he didn't get suspended FOR PITTING. The suspension was for 10 daps
[8:51:48] yaboycasper: Honestly it doesn‚Äôt make it fun atleast in my opinion feel like if you constantly win those heist off of cheap moves. Just feels like it would get old
[8:52:00] Gangstagrover: what if they did rule of 4 and each member subtracts from swaps
[8:52:02] Phantroneous: No smart is the right wording, They got their crappy victory and did it how they wanted blah blah, gotta read what I said, I preferred summits way of chases.
[8:52:32] FRANKIEonPCin256PIXELS: 10 more hours
[8:52:35] Veixa: A wise man once said: Theres only so much fun to be had in RP, and I want ALL of it
