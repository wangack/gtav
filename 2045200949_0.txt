[0:30:20] qihk: making another door to the back of the kitchen so you can access the windows + have it like a pantry for stuff.
[0:30:28] GRAYURSUSTANA: it doesnt matter because you can only see it clipping through the house from inside the house

[0:31:06] Atomizer: too low now
[0:31:08] GRAYURSUSTANA: it doesn't matter it sticks through trust
[0:31:09] thejoxter_: Why don't you make the hidden entrance start from the first floor, and make the one in the basement a dead end, cause most people think the hidden entrances are down stairs. That will trick them! make it start from behind the kitchen or something!

[0:32:19] BoJackJohnsson: Place it and look at if from your charecter. Then you see it for real
[0:32:21] fate024: This is happening cause the house technically "only has two floors"
[0:32:22] fluxNikko: check the roof
