[2:02:30] Liyo17: @das_oleg Can you?? I've been playing lawn mower simulator for years now!!
[2:02:31] PushyMcButtons: 10 isn't the magic number
[2:02:33] DannyWuzHere_: 77% believe🤯
[2:02:37] saintshino: Rockstar knows how much we love driving across the map and back.
[2:02:45] wookiesla420: that’s gotta be the closest location ever
[2:03:04] sujay855764: Happy Australia Day Matto

[2:03:29] ITSPHONXY: How long is left of the stream?
[2:03:30] Murphimself: someone keeps throwing the odds at the last second dviperPC
[2:03:31] Gladunyasha77: I got 50/50 tow truck missions and never seen anything below 1.5 km
[2:03:41] WackyFolf: It's probably more profitable to drop that car in the ocean
[2:03:52] PushyMcButtons: the hook tows you back
[2:04:01] wookiesla420: Best RNG
[2:04:06] Zeroucar9: ummm where did the poll go?
[2:04:08] Neriol: weeny KEKW
[2:04:10] Hlebushek06: Fun when you're not trying to build up 5 mil from them

[2:04:14] KidsOnBlackOps: like tamater but without the tuh
[2:04:17] saintshino: I enjoy the tow truck jobs enjoyable when you can jam out to the pop station.
[2:04:18] eldergrove_maggs: dviperRNG dviperRNG dviperRNG
[2:04:18] KelpyOG: I prefer the twitch stream cause quality is better but MAN the delay is insane on here
[2:04:20] vollverschxssen: Why did you shave your beard?
[2:04:27] ITSPHONXY: No they aint fun but watching your streams is so dviperWave
[2:04:34] Liyo17: @das_oleg Better than playing other games or better than doing the same setup 10 thousand times
[2:04:37] szybowiec069: they re fun at least 1 out of 20 times, and they are meant to give you passive income, dude, get over it, gta is ur 2nd job, YOURS especially lol
[2:04:39] eldergrove_maggs: @KelpyOG do you have low latency on
[2:04:41] ch0sen01ne: these missions helps me with my insomnia
[2:04:46] Manytheman1: ever towed a tow truck with a tank in this game?
[2:04:50] das_oleg: imagine opening a tow truck business and accepting jons that are so far away, great idea R* NotLikeThis
[2:04:53] eggsupreme56: If you enjoy driving these mission ain't bad
[2:04:55] WackyFolf: The delay is lower on Twitch and the quality is also lower on Twitch
[2:04:59] Gladunyasha77: Well now we know that strawberry chop shop location is the best if you are keen on doing Tanya's work in online
[2:05:05] Eu_oenzzo: can someone explain to me why is matto towing cars?
[2:05:07] Neriol: same, it's 5:30am here LOL
[2:05:07] saintshino: He didn't shave, this is a clone @vollverschxssen
[2:05:11] KelpyOG: @eldergrove_maggs I did, thank you I didn't know that was a thing
[2:05:15] Neriol: @Eu_oenzzo read the title
[2:05:16] wookiesla420: do you do 6 cars per week?
[2:05:22] WackyFolf: I see
[2:05:28] das_oleg: @liyo17 better as GTA 5
[2:05:30] szybowiec069: oi Matt, btw having like 3-4 channels on youtube and also investing in shorts really helped me discover you, good job
[2:05:32] sushikwo: is it profitable at least?
[2:05:36] Eu_oenzzo: @Neriol ohhhhhh i didnt see it thanks
[2:05:39] DannyWuzHere_: 4 ads🥲I need a sub
[2:05:44] regynate: can do*
[2:05:47] eldergrove_maggs: @KelpyOG having it on is good don't turn it off. if youre having delay with low latency on then it may be something on ur end
[2:05:54] ITSPHONXY: Matto do you still have the hole in the side of your head from ages ago
[2:06:02] Wryfrost: You MIGHT be able to get a second chop shop on your second character. Don't quote me on that tho
[2:06:17] WackyFolf: It does annoy me that Twitch still hasn't adopted AV1 and still exclusively uses H.264
[2:06:17] regynate: cheetah
[2:06:18] Manytheman1: ads
[2:06:28] Hlebushek06: @Wryfrost you do but that doesnt progress the award on this character
[2:06:28] xerxil: Creative Succeeder!
[2:06:29] KelpyOG: @eldergrove_maggs The stream isn't slow or laggy or anything, it's just 5-10 seconds behind the YT stream
[2:06:31] summerforfun7: What you drinking
[2:06:38] jamal_xa: wryfrost wont the awards be separate tho
[2:06:44] Wryfrost: @Hlebushek06 Well there goes that idea :{
[2:06:45] klubheads: dviperWave dviperWave dviperWave
[2:06:51] Manytheman1: does anybody know the exact amount of times that matto has seen cougars in missions?
[2:06:56] ITSPHONXY: OMG did matto lose weight he looks great
[2:06:56] eldergrove_maggs: @eldergrove_maggs they're exactly the same for me i dunno
[2:06:57] Manytheman1: i must know
[2:07:03] ThirdGen87x2: Matt you should check and see if second character car deliveries count toward award. I think some awards are linked across dual character accounts
[2:07:13] nemo4zero: matto's character insurance premium must be insane
[2:07:17] saintshino: I wonder how much your insurance company makes replacing your futuristic flying bike.
[2:07:31] Hlebushek06: @ThirdGen87x2 I do awards on both characters, they're not linked in this update
[2:07:44] ThirdGen87x2: hahahaha understandable lol
[2:07:47] xpertplayer90: what r u doing mr matto
[2:07:59] das_oleg: If you explode, can i have you PC?
[2:08:04] Manytheman1: out of everything in gta you cannot commit tax fraud
[2:08:04] Genesis9628: Is hiding from you to mess with your speed run
[2:08:12] ThirdGen87x2: @hlebushek06 thank you for confirmation!
[2:08:16] Not_Velindian: is this the elusive 5 o'clock matto?
[2:08:21] eggsupreme56: Yay
