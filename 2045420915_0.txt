[0:58:54] djuicer6969: lol
[0:58:58] SaltySnacks20: the paid training should probably be harder and more specialized, to warrant a 500 price tag. It's a step up from just hanging out with Swan by the beach.

[1:00:38] JetpackDuck: The company hasnt really given Swan any reason to be loyal to them

[1:09:50] SaltySnacks20: Some probably see it as a loyalty test. The lack of returns for a while will weed out people who aren't 100% committed
[1:10:07] icoyskee: interns should voice their concerns to the board members
[1:10:48] JetpackDuck: You need to have history with the ppl there or the company to have loyalty

[5:54:33] Zombiesweat: You can learn with time, but if you rely so heavily on looking down it's going to take a while
[5:55:11] Zombiesweat: When I was a kid, I learned a lot from Minecraft bc of there being so many keybinds etc
[5:55:17] ChillR2: I accepted it because I know I won't spend the time needed to improve oop
[5:55:27] Zombiesweat: Like I'd hope you know where WASD is at this point Crystal

[38:11:13] Fuzzy_Contreg: That's why I never went with linux on my desktop, adding the additional hassle of having to make sure all my games work is just a pain I can't be arsed with
[38:12:28] CapTeo1: him being happy and shit then swan hits with the "not really EZ "
