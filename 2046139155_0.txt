[1:01:24] skyledrick: I mean if it was an ambush that means ash would have had to lure them into it, if they just randomly showed up that’s on them
[1:01:31] Veffes: yeah its not an ambush
[1:01:32] BakinPacman: @Veffes thats the thing though. If you don't know then maybe try work it out first LUL

[1:05:57] OverhaulEX: to X anyone who does something that helps lang's crew is enemy to him

[1:07:17] Hazetheking: @overhaulex what logic LUL
[1:07:26] fouzman: Ash knew Lang getting hunted, yet helping Sani with Lang jn the crew. That's asking for trouble
[1:07:38] RobDior: trueee @fouzman
[1:07:42] blackgate64: true
[1:07:46] BakinPacman: gang on business
[1:07:52] BakinPacman: kinda reminds me of the gallery issues
[1:08:06] Teddsan: i mean at this point u either act or leave it be what else u can do
[1:08:07] say0nara69: its mixed a lot of civ vs civ
[1:08:08] jakob5330: Its also dangerus, you attacking a lot of different people with a lot of other connections
[1:08:10] MrKing8: Both are valid to certain point.
[1:08:12] yuhClean: @fouzman Did we not come to the conclusion he was going to hunt her anyway???
[1:08:16] NerZulek: yeah but hes targeting Ash for some reason
[1:08:17] BakinPacman: feel like the cops just need to come down harder on it
[1:08:24] Tempah___: his side totally looks like an ambush imo
[1:08:25] BVNISH: either it's gang on gang, so you go for the gang; or it's business and then you go the business route - IMO that is
[1:08:26] ChiefLongsword: lets attack civs because I cant find my enemy
[1:08:27] BakinPacman: seems a little early for the gun violence

[1:12:43] BigAmpTrice: How can someone tell you who not to hangout with
[1:12:49] conzfearacy1: also how could it be a ambush if we was actively hunting before hand on the first shoot
[1:12:51] loveloopx: @Coffeeeyy its early in 4.0 there is still time to form groups and such
[1:13:08] ExGen36: he might be justified in attacking but then anyone else that get involved is also justified in retaliating
[1:13:10] khaled_5655: Head of union Ash ashlolOK
[1:13:18] TropicalToucan: The problem is X is associating Langs criminal group with his clean job cover  LUL They just mad over computers

[1:15:24] AfroKage_17: Ash was being targetted even before the first "ambush"
[1:15:24] SchnitzleKing: Honestly i completly agree with Lilly and Jordan
[1:15:27] VendettaUK: she should get in contact with him
[1:15:28] xshanini: with out
[1:15:29] HoronXI: i mean one is a civ job and the other is a crim org

[1:15:36] rruoh: eat takis.
[1:15:37] Cambellar: from what i saw from ash pov they rolled up and x said why didnt you answer my calles with his gun out then it looked like he shot first
[1:15:38] ChirouMe: I don’t see how Ash could have acted any different than she has
[1:15:40] ShadesDown: first shooting justified second seemed unjust
[1:15:46] SlyDolphin: seems like she is kinda asking for it...
[1:15:46] turntablist_mk2: do what u want YEP
[1:15:49] Hawkit: If she's not okay with being shot she should stop doing sanitation with Lang is pretty much where I'm at.
[1:15:49] saynt84: I think you're tight with ash, the bias should lie with her Shruge
[1:15:50] iraffis: At this point it's up to her
[1:15:52] Tempah___: perspectives matter, should always back ash but if she’s clearly hanging with lang it’s expected
[1:15:53] conzfearacy1: the 2nd time she wasnt even with lang and co
[1:15:59] rimurru_: just ask them not to rob her if she die in crossfire to bad
[1:15:59] itzGilBi: if hydra was a officially gang it's not was so complicated
[1:16:00] nintynien: i think now you ask her what she wants from the group
[1:16:00] epicninja92: Aloo sntWave
[1:16:04] khaled_5655: ashlolCool
[1:16:11] OverhaulEX: yeah she said she just want to grind KEKW
[1:16:21] brittybop: all sani is getting hit, so its not gonna matter who she's with or what she does...and it's hard when she's alone without nothydra most of the time she's awake rn
[1:16:24] xshanini: I think a conversation with ash would be better then a conversation with people who aren’t involved
[1:16:26] whodonut5: we know it wasnt a ambush but company doesnt know that and it looked like one from their perspective
[1:16:27] rache_stephe: she didn’t even want you guys to get a gun at first iirc
[1:16:28] BakinPacman: theres no point ash calling him
[1:16:35] epicninja92: kebunDance kebunDance
[1:16:36] BakinPacman: emotions will block any good talking

[1:16:47] oomor: all of sani is getting hit tho right?
[1:16:51] ShadesDown: at the very least flippy will learn how much JP respects him so win/win
[1:16:52] kgenera: yee
[1:16:54] MrKing8: eatt
[1:16:54] Hazetheking: ash being targeted earlier and then getting gunned down twice for just working just sucks
[1:17:02] Unk0010: do what you want breh
[1:17:12] DagsM8: The company wants to take down the sani union and Ash is in that union.
[1:17:14] BakinPacman: he should just accept your work basically and ash should try to avoid hanging with lang temporariliy
[1:17:19] khaled_5655: ashlolSip
[1:17:22] xSwift: you could also argue shes family and you protect her no matter what
[1:17:23] CivilWars: if you associate with a gang leader, even if it is during their civ cover job, you run the risk of getting got
[1:17:28] kgenera: What does mario want
[1:17:33] loveloopx: watching ash be on edge doing sani for hours has been content but also very tiring
[1:17:33] Spartanb31: first one when she was with Lang she knew what could happen, last night was X just looking for her
[1:17:33] Abdoullah21: morning chat and silent
[1:17:41] loveloopx: Shrug
[1:17:55] sirachalife: lang getting all his money from sani, makes sense to want to shut that down
[1:18:03] seratodopemine: From neutral pov, what you said is fine. But you guys are in a group, so you have to choose her side imo
[1:18:09] MrKing8: btw did you decide when you gonna do 24? or nah sntNom
[1:18:09] TropicalToucan: LUL
[1:18:10] exykek: i feel like its like if your lil bro would do something bad u would still defend him and as a gang leader you care about your people no mater they are in right or wrong and u will always want to make them feel safe.
[1:18:13] VendettaUK: id get her to contact him to at least get her point across as shes got nothing to loose in talking to him or she is going to get shot either way @Silent

[1:18:32] ShadesDown: I would actually agree @sirachalife but the entire city gets it;s resources from sanitation.
[1:18:36] Darnitdija: i think JP is equating interns and union workers. interns were actively fighting with lang and crew while most sani workers are clean and were getting attacked because lang and crew were responding the the interns actively antagonizing due to company orders
[1:18:39] SintheaCj: SintheaCj subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months! 
[1:18:41] conzfearacy1: She wasn't even with lang the 2nd shooting and that happened because of supposed ambum that never took place
[1:18:43] jkb_xD: You also have to wonder if lang is getting her involved because he knows her ties.
[1:18:46] Spartanb31: thing is JP is to far behind to even try and stop it now, he is just causing more trouble but that’s JP for you
[1:18:51] Abdoullah21: sntHeart sntHeart

[1:19:04] rubyn0odle: 3 more days to paycheck collect :D
[1:19:10] BVNISH: @Darnitdija that's a decent take
[1:19:15] HoronXI: @tito23q yeah pretty much. one is a civ job and the other a crim org.
[1:19:16] sirachalife: @ShadesDown yeah thats true it inadvertently hurts city as whole
[1:19:18] Hazetheking: @darnitdija good take
[1:19:38] ColieBonez: yes
[1:19:41] HEGGA: 100%
[1:19:41] ColieBonez: def
[1:19:41] Hazetheking: benji and ray definitely know her ties
[1:19:41] flowerlesspower: she got shot before that do?
[1:19:42] XxGazzaGazxX: 100%
[1:19:44] atrollusername: yeah it's dumb
[1:19:45] BakinPacman: well him attacking her when she was not with them kinda makes it moot
[1:19:45] xshanini: has she ?
[1:19:47] ShadesDown: she wasn’t the second time though was she?
[1:19:49] decaffgluten: ICANT
[1:19:50] ColieBonez: she shouldnt b doin that
[1:19:51] tito23q: but thats union period
[1:19:51] kdub_og: Yeah thats the issue
[1:19:58] ChirouMe: hmmm
[1:20:00] seratodopemine: Yeah. That is whatever. 2nd time is bit far
[1:20:05] lalacate: but what about the second time. no excuse for him that time. that’s targeted
[1:20:07] flowerlesspower: she got shot 2 time with lang
[1:20:12] tito23q: regardless if with lang or not union were getting hunted
[1:20:13] brittybop: but she didn't know how bad it was when she was with them
[1:20:20] HoronXI: the first one was when it just started. the second one, shes just running without lang and co.
[1:20:20] decaffgluten: ICANT ICANT ICANT ICANT ICANT ICANT ICANT ICANT ICANT ICANT ICANT ICANT ICANT ICANT ICANT ICANT ICANT ICANT
[1:20:22] toastypinky: they robbing an shooting all people in the union doesn’t matter who she is with
[1:20:23] flowerlesspower: 1st time was just because she was in the union
[1:20:24] turntablist_mk2: when your loyal u don't consider association, it's automatic.
[1:20:27] Hazetheking: they were targeting sani workers anyway she wouldve probably been gunned down regardless
[1:20:29] exykek: shes either being silly or knows shes under big wing and abuses it
[1:20:31] xshanini: oh fair
[1:20:34] charliee1306: just end the company ez
[1:20:37] flowerlesspower: xD
[1:20:39] conzfearacy1: @flowerlesspower No she got shot 1 time with lang not the second
[1:20:40] ChirouMe: i don’t think it mattered. they were targetting sani workers
[1:20:41] ShadesDown: sntGiggle
[1:20:43] loveloopx: flop stare
[1:20:48] HEGGA: It was yellow Madge
[1:20:49] Spartanb31: indeed if she wasn’t with Lang she would have still got shot cause that’s JP for you he doesn’t think when he is in that mood
[1:20:53] Maxverine: Flop Bubbles Dugong
[1:20:59] flowerlesspower: @conzfearacy1 the 1st time she was not with them 2nd time she was
[1:21:21] MrKing8: KEKW
[1:21:27] loveloopx: and she got shot again today no? so thats three times hmjj

[1:23:18] A_choo: umm
[1:23:21] Darnitdija: she shouldn’t have been in the truck but they were setting Union sanitation workers up so she would have still got shot knowing how JP is and today he actively hunted her today with no lang in sight
[1:23:26] ShadesDown: she’d pick a fox guarenteed
[1:23:28] loveloopx: lil pup is crazy
[1:23:29] flowerlesspower: @Hazetheking she got shot or shanked with randoms before the incident with lang
[1:23:30] ColieBonez: ok lilly def is a pick me tho

[1:24:34] rimurru_: what if she was  the bait and didnt even know
[1:24:35] loveloopx: scrajj
[1:24:42] ExGen36: it would happen because they didn't know Lang was there until after they pulled up on her
[1:24:42] flowerlesspower: @Hazetheking whatever she was targeted 3 times
[1:24:42] Maxverine: I am so lost Awkward
[1:24:51] MrKing8: same max
[1:24:53] rache_stephe: same ydavGIGGLE
[1:24:53] Refanpng: auh
[1:24:56] Hazetheking: @flowerlesspower there we go
[1:24:57] himbo33: They held her up even before they knew Lang and Harry were with her
[1:25:01] jayelay: I mean shes put herself in the firing line of being acused of an ambush due to being around the poeple thats actively in a "conflict"

[1:25:07] Maxverine: hmjj
[1:25:08] flowerlesspower: @Hazetheking but its same thing im not trying to argue things we on same page
[1:25:10] BeckaPurce: she was shot without Lang or co, you know that right?
[1:25:10] brittybop: they were also trying to set her up before they shot her the first   time didn't they? she woke up to all this
[1:25:13] MrKing8: Hmmge
[1:25:14] sm0keo: @Darnitdija yeah honestly at that point the question should be why is he even attacking sani workers in the first place LUL thatll expose how dumb it is LUL
[1:25:14] Refanpng: mhm
[1:25:20] XxGazzaGazxX: shot once you got to think about if you want to be in this again to get shot 2 times she made a choice my view
[1:25:23] 00Elite: whether it was to happen or not, dont just put yourself in that position so it does happen
[1:25:23] Spartanb31: Lang wasn’t even in sight when she got shot tho so kinda says she was going to get shot
[1:25:24] DaftFrik: you would want to make sure you were above reproach
[1:25:24] ShadesDown: did ash give the details of todays shooting?
[1:25:25] huskiii3: sntDerp
[1:25:27] BakinPacman: but that does not mean doubling down is ok
[1:25:29] ChirouMe: well…. turning it around. Flippy knew g6 trucks were being robbed the other day, and still went to do g6
[1:25:32] loveloopx: dankTalk
[1:25:32] HoronXI: yeah. understand. so that if we have beef it must be a concrete reason
[1:25:37] Maxverine: got it ok
[1:25:40] MrKing8: ok
[1:25:46] ninjagirl8816: sntSip
[1:25:48] khaled_5655: yeb
[1:25:55] BakinPacman: he chose to double down instead of talking to anyone
[1:25:58] Darnitdija: true she would have been completely innocent
[1:26:06] victoriangrace: yeah but it wasnt that Ash was hanging with Lang that got her shot…it was her just doing what she always does which is sanitation right?
[1:26:11] ShadesDown: gets shot with lang so then next day isn’t with lang and doing job and still gets shot.
[1:26:16] charliee1306: she was shot by him doing sani for apps trying to ambush him
[1:26:22] BakinPacman: ray and benji should have told jp not to do it
[1:26:48] Sebastian1033: Strengthen her argument
[1:26:49] Spartanb31: ray and benji have no say when it’s JP
[1:26:51] HoronXI: @BakinPacman they did on ash but JP being JP he doesnt care. Lang's friend is his enemies pretty much
[1:26:51] jlynn36: @victoriangrace I was going to say the same thing
[1:26:52] lalacate: I think the argument is fair if JP was acting alone. Benji and Ray should no better
[1:26:54] Shanky_k: Guilty by association..
[1:26:58] toastypinky: ok so when JP had the option to talk to ASH about what happened why didn’t he. He just went to shoot her again
[1:27:00] Refanpng: mhm
[1:27:05] Ghouliexxo: nodd
[1:27:05] winterskyyyy: MMMM
[1:27:09] hondaboi93: 100%
[1:27:10] ChirouMe: hmmm
[1:27:11] BakinPacman: the problem is if jp is a wild gun then treat him as wild
[1:27:11] Puk3s: Well and JP claimed she set him up
[1:27:12] ColieBonez: but
[1:27:15] Maxverine: and then a random angel gets shot coz one of the angels was in the car YEP
[1:27:16] CivilWars: Lang using the sani union to feed his computer business, which is competition with the company, puts all sani union workers, including Ash, at risk.
[1:27:17] Unk0010: ok but then they go hunt the Angel after for getting shoot?
[1:27:17] Puk3s: Not sure though
[1:27:18] Sebastian1033: WAYTOODANK too many voices
[1:27:20] BakinPacman: just put him in his place LUL
[1:27:24] ColieBonez: jp had been hunting ash be4 that
[1:27:26] XxGazzaGazxX: @silent is right on this
[1:27:30] brittybop: ok, what about the fact that when she was with Lang, she said they were masked and even she didn't know them at first?
[1:27:46] lalacate: also that argument make more sense when more gang gang shit has been established. Everyone is hanging out with everyone this early in the wipe
[1:27:49] brittybop: how would he have known who she was with then?
[1:27:53] ShadesDown: the most wanted being anyone doing sanitation is where this thought falls apart.
[1:27:54] HoronXI: @brittybop technically the first one is quite scuffed due to tsunami
[1:27:58] brittybop: lang and co
[1:28:00] 00Elite: i think the missing piece for flippy is The company crew didnt know lang was there before hand and decided to roll up on ash
[1:28:07] toastypinky: she chose to do her job with the people they work with
[1:28:10] ExGen36: all I'm gonna say is, the aggressor should be responsible not the victim for not avoiding the problem!
[1:28:14] tears0ffire: She’s most wanted because she a head of Sani to help hydra be in a better spot in the future
[1:28:20] MrKing8: ratJAM
[1:28:38] 00Elite: ratJAM
[1:28:42] ColieBonez: jp was already hunting ash tho
[1:28:42] Maxverine: mario finally made a gang
[1:28:43] brittybop: right...but they could have easily been tom, dick, and harry and still same outcome
[1:28:55] 23Fluent: tbf buddha is the pettiest person in the city and jp is a crackhead so its a tough situation to even understand
[1:28:59] ShadesDown: idk todays just felt like to many extra steps removed from Lang

[1:29:05] crownberriess: it's best to talk to Lang, its a fog on your character still
[1:29:09] Refanpng: mhm
[1:29:16] rimurru_: Mario is the real RatKing the fakeone needs to die
[1:29:16] HoronXI: @crownberriess yeah should talk to lang as well
[1:29:19] ScionGod: @00Elite but would ash have been shot if lang didnt shoot
[1:29:21] conzfearacy1: @00Elite yea that's true JP didn't know harry and lang were there at the time of the shooting till after the fact
[1:29:22] idab71: Ya this conflict is Lang vs xqc
[1:29:29] MrsReaperShadow: So since she was with Lang the first time she got shot it gives JP a free pass to shoot her no matter who she is doing sani with?...I understand when she was with Lang yes but the second time she wasn't with lang
[1:29:30] khaled_5655: ashlolSip ashlolSip
[1:29:31] TropicalToucan: @idab71 you mean JP
[1:29:33] Puk3s: Agree
[1:29:37] HoronXI: @ScionGod he will cause just before that they were executing union members
[1:29:46] saynt84: Shouldn't Flippy be biased tho?
[1:29:53] xdSilly: WideVeryCat
[1:29:53] BakinPacman: the fact that he shot her a second time shows that he does not care anyway
[1:29:55] kessy1893: question is did ash expect or knew she might get shot while rolling with lang
[1:29:56] tito23q: didnt you get told that she was going to get set up prior to the attack?
[1:29:56] idab71: Xqc wants to hurt anyone connected with lang
[1:30:01] StreamElements:  Check out Silents youtube channel with stream VOD's and Variety games! https://www.youtube.com/@silentvariety
[1:30:04] ColieBonez: yea i mean she shouldnt be rollin w/ them at all
[1:30:05] Refanpng: mhm
[1:30:09] kbrugz: its a tail old as time whenever lang gets in conflict the opposing party always attacks langs civs
[1:30:10] Refanpng: @xdSilly DAP
[1:30:11] tears0ffire: lol I’m actually really unbiased but ok
[1:30:14] 23Fluent: @kessy1893 yea thats important to know
[1:30:16] toastypinky: ok if ASH WAS at Snr Buns an she knew Speedy was getting target an she’s in the kitchen cooking an JP walks in and hold up Speedy but a random worker tries to attack JP is it right for JP then to start blasting everyone in the kitchen
[1:30:19] conzfearacy1: @ColieBonez she wasnt rolling with them 2nd time
[1:30:22] uenostation64: At this point,if she wears blue helmet,she is choosing this.
[1:30:35] LoonyToon: If JP and Ash stories line up then it is what it is.
[1:30:36] khaled_5655: ashlolOK ashlolOK
[1:30:39] xdSilly: DAP Refanpng
[1:30:40] ColieBonez: but jp already hunting her be4 theyd even had the 'ambush'
[1:30:42] Abdoullah21: truing
[1:30:48] BakinPacman: he targeted her the second time. he should not want a apology at that point
[1:30:48] ColieBonez: thats where jp fucked up
[1:30:50] crownberriess: @horonxi your pov it's fog, you are saying things flippy doesn't know
[1:31:01] Puk3s: It's going to be an interesting conflict because I don't see either X or Lang backing down

[1:31:28] ShadesDown: fair
[1:31:29] Refanpng: mhm
[1:31:31] kessy1893: i think if ash knew or was expecting to get shot she would not have been rolling with lang and co even if they set up to be ready in case something happens
[1:31:36] mixersuxs: W MY SCCCHLIMEEEEEE DAP arnieSit
[1:31:40] movin100: AshK didn;t wanna do anything about it in the first time

[1:32:17] ColieBonez: as soon as she heard shit was goin on she shoulda stayed away from lang n them
[1:32:21] kessy1893: ppl in the city are so cheap its crazy to me LUL
[1:32:23] MrKing8: lol
[1:32:28] ShadesDown: see that’s where I’m at @movin100 like the first one a whole day went by without retaliation just discussions. todays was different
[1:32:32] BakinPacman: she has stayed away
[1:32:37] BakinPacman: she got shot again
[1:32:42] MothershipV1: Aren't they 300 dollars? What condition are they? Okay 1000 sounds good LUL
[1:32:43] saynt84: I think its moot anyway, Ash said she didn't want to do anything about it
[1:32:48] charliee1306: but how can she do sani but stay out of the conflict if jp isn’t willing
[1:32:50] jkb_xD: She doesnt have to ride with harry and lang to do sanitation. she Can still be lowkey and do union stuff.
[1:32:51] khaled_5655: ashlolSip
[1:32:52] BakinPacman: thats the biggest issue
[1:32:53] Puk3s: The logical people know
