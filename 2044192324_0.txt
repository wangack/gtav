[0:16:09] Morningstarter: could sell the gpus to the guild
[0:16:12] Isen_Mage: YEP
[0:16:17] bwehn: can put the replaced old GPUs in the guilds rack
[0:16:24] Sonaro8: depends on how much utility bills are for that id guess
[0:16:25] CptApples: advanced gpus are better long term
[0:16:27] rmcgowan: Yeah, that makes sense. It doesn't sound unreasonable to ask the Guild to at least get the circuit boards before the racks are made
[0:16:28] Isen_Mage: mines double, but costs double + 5 BTC
[0:16:31] Reiv_: better wait for TX9090s...
[0:16:36] Hobbitbot: guess it depends on how much Power is
[0:16:38] tigerland06: once you know how much the power costs, it will be easier to determine the worth of the adv gpu
[0:16:40] klugklug: nodd
[0:16:41] itspacecowboy: it going to depend on how much the power bill going to be.
[0:16:48] MJ77seven: you could sell the basic ones
[0:16:52] footmunched: Is the power tied to the Rack, or the GPU's in them?
[0:16:52] jerabet: @prozorftw Only if they get to sell and profit on the basic GPUs.
[0:17:01] mugcostanza: kyliebList
[0:17:01] L4zyb4ssturd: it makes sense if you get to a point when youre just waiting on things to unlock
[0:17:13] SpectreUK: Hows the lag when entering the house did Jazz fix it?
[0:17:35] Isen_Mage: it's exponential growth, so you're better off using the BUTC for 2 more racks of GPU's than the advanced GPU's

[0:28:47] aluckynewb: Time to buy more benchs

[2:40:55] captaincameron: a week in rp is like a month too
[2:40:56] Sonaro8: having em just reduced to a base snr level of person but still in the group but not given prioity on anything you guys do untill they prove themselfs again seems the fair way
[2:40:58] Beta_Vidoh: the world move on
[2:40:58] BladedBuzzer: its not punishing to say you're not around so we need to focus elsewhere shrujj

[2:41:30] Darkri19: Tbh i dont even think they need to be reduced in rank
[2:41:32] dustbells: Some people enjoy progression RP and some people don't. Yokai had much more room for non-progression RP than KC does right now

[2:44:16] klugklug: KC would be seen a lot more if they all had prio
[2:44:17] mugcostanza: kyliebList
[2:44:17] zenatr: No need to fully cut people out of the group, it's simple enough to give them an inactive sorta role where not much is expected, but they also don't get prio over other people
[2:44:21] candorus: LISSEN
[2:44:22] Harcini: a lot of paperwork to go trough to make it work
[2:44:23] candorus: Listening
