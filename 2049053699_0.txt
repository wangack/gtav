[3:12:21] 4rtur3k: whats your shaders and shadows are at?
[3:12:23] nickgeeebs: graphics drivers?
[3:12:24] adgpz: check task manager and see if CPU/ Memory/ Disk Usage is spiking up. You may also monitor your CPU and GPU temps
[3:12:25] Fenio987: @Dumi90 u say that but this flickering is weird it doesn't happend on other streams
[3:12:33] Azhela: @abdoss Bad internet wouldn't cause FPS drops like this though
[3:12:35] IraqiWizard: Only other thing i can think of that might fix this is a full PC and windows reinstall
[3:12:37] applepure: this actually looks like her GPU is failing
[3:12:41] DrezziiD: @NoraExplorer Sometimes running a game in windowed/borderless can cause mayor lag. Try running it in fullscreen to see

[3:13:35] 875695: tech guy GIGACHAD
[3:13:37] Levitax: Ok, not sure how relevant this is for GTA. But do u know if the SSD, where your 'page file' is stored at, has enough free space on it? I know for games like Star citizen the page file is a huge deal.
[3:13:39] ndx07: lmao not even 1000hz

[3:13:54] XCheck777: it isnt a refresh rate problem. the game isnt loading the textures correctly
[3:13:55] XnDogg: I wonder if you have any issues playing Rust. That game is such a CPU hog that it migh rule out anythign with your pc. just a thought.
[3:13:57] tiny_medic: There must be some textures from the new update that are not compatible with your graphic card  because it was not converted correctly and fcks up your fps. Try to put eveything to low and see if it's same problem.
[3:13:57] Djpaesgana: keep Auto
[3:14:01] stormvlad: activate nvidia overlay and check temps in real time, while in game, not while alt tabbed. press alt+z to enter settings @NoraExplorer
[3:14:01] Zephyriq: its not ur graphics settings this is something deeper
[3:14:03] AntiHeroATX: Cap your frames, GTA has issues with uncapped frames

[3:14:06] 875695: o7
[3:14:06] extrafrozen: Check CPU & GPU temperatures
[3:14:06] lotstrom: settings should not be a problem. you can test that by running regular GTA

[3:18:16] jesleaks: Didn't you get the same issues in Palworld yesterday? Maybe test another game to check if it's the game or the PC @NoraExplorer
[3:18:17] donkarkinoss: so its definately game related

[3:19:37] fastcars888: @NoraExplorer, maybe try doing a pc benchmark
[3:19:39] SpaceG33k: check if its the same on salmas pc, if it works there, reinstall windows on yours
[3:19:42] im_vylo: Try to do what I posted in discord, by changing your 3D Settings Power Management to Prefer Maximum Performance instead of Auto
[3:19:43] adgpz: if you already check the temps and it is all normal. might be related to drivers. i would recommend doing a cleaning up your gpu driver and reinstalling it.
[3:19:44] YAIKZ: Have you checked GeForce Experience for updates?
[3:19:46] CyberBenjaminSW: You could try deleting the FiveM cache. "To clear the FiveM cache, locate the FiveM's data directory and delete the “cache”, “server-cache” and “server-cache-priv” folders. Clearing the FiveM cache is basically deleting file folders, which is a simple step that most of us are familiar with"

[3:21:46] Dango4: rubberbanding/flickering assets are usually network related and/or storage/controller issues with the resource cache (can be a different location than the main game installation folder). Network issues would be so difficult to fix, but trying connecting to the server via a vpn can be something to try. or changing your DNS server is another, though that'd be less likely to have much effect in this case. storage issues can be either failing SSD/HDD or outdated cache. (not game installation)

[3:26:16] Dango4: rubberbanding/flickering assets are usually network related and/or storage/controller issues with the resource cache (can be a different location than the main game installation folder). Network issues would be so difficult to fix, but trying connecting to the server via a vpn can be something to try. or changing your DNS server is another, though that'd be less likely to have much effect in this case. storage issues can be either failing SSD/HDD or outdated cache. (not game installation)

[3:35:55] leaavz: Is there not anyone who can help in nopixel discord
[3:35:55] silvercrow_0: bios update, gpu firmware update maybe @NoraExplorer  󠀀
[3:35:55] tzatzikis: hw info
[3:35:55] nomoreheroes__: I think the CPU or Ram is maxed out turn off the internet browser
[3:35:56] Whimzy_: GTA IS A VERY DEMANDING GAME. ESPECIALLY IF YOURE ON A CUSTOMER SERVER
[3:35:56] mythix_x: in my opinion, the problem is mostly Nopixel, so many unoptimized assets in the area and its only gonna get worse @NoraExplorer
[3:35:56] QuakerG: If no other game is like this then its not a hardware issue
[3:35:57] lukigeri: win11 update o7
[3:35:57] TTUCROWN: its a resource hog tbh
[3:35:58] donkarkinoss: ask someone who knows bout nopixel to help u
[3:35:59] Sir_Richardt: the other games arent online with million assets and people tho
[3:36:00] mcdevil1988: gta5 is pretty heavy compares to other games
[3:36:01] kablard: If the issue is only on GTA, the game is obvioisly the problem.
[3:36:06] hvmmvsapien: @OsiDRobles she tried already
[3:36:07] TommyGeck0: is she getting low frames or is it lag?
[3:36:12] Olivron: @victornor bro stfu
[3:36:12] imshades: Try lowering your obs bit rate. Could be overtaking the encoder
[3:36:13] RealDerko: nora i miss you
[3:36:15] Kevie70: Have you tried when not streaming?
[3:36:16] Alezzo: @NoraExplorer Maybe try running around the city on foot instead? Gradually loading/unload chunks might help to rebuild cache more smoothly 󠀀
[3:36:16] JsLeos: The game is the issue
[3:36:17] enlighten_me92: Its way better than yesterday
[3:36:20] Wmw2013: its just that area
[3:36:21] ndx07: just let it build where it lags
[3:36:21] OgBazza: its just NP 44.0
[3:36:22] tzatzikis: so its your gpi
[3:36:23] Codex88: its the texture limit thing
[3:36:23] Sivvii_: might have to stay away from the house for a bit
[3:36:23] DatguyBK: it’s a south side issue with everyone’s houses
[3:36:25] genn1_: @kablard if only chat understood this
[3:36:25] tzatzikis: gpu
[3:36:26] maelris: it must be assets
[3:36:26] Monst3r_GG: its asset rendering in popular areas

[3:36:29] topmiddle: its the racks and shit
[3:36:30] gibber69: cursed monkaW
[3:36:33] Nahsta: because these are GTA5 assets and not nopixel custom stuff
[3:36:33] SupportYourLocalLurker: it’s probably just the game
[3:36:34] mythix_x: yeah exactly its Nopixel thinking they can put a bunch of shit in one area but this game cant handle it
[3:36:35] mrbouda1: i say uninstall every thing and unstall new game
[3:36:35] noezx: Maybe just circle the map to see if shit needs to load
[3:36:36] xShiryu23: time to buy a house in paleto then

[3:37:08] LokiTheElusive: if it's fine in areas with less objects and pedestrians its probably CPU-based
[3:37:09] DreamLantern_: @NoraExplorer there are several youtube videos for that, maybe try after stream without all the random chat input?
[3:37:09] neverlasting: your pc is telling you to be a variety streamer lol
[3:37:10] dontaskwhy__: NoraExplorer 2 days ago everything was fine so i dont get it Hmm

[3:37:38] Davser75: @zalciunaz Other streamer have no issues
[3:37:39] nomoreheroes__: You might also need a new MOBO or CPU combo, try a Ryzen 7800X 3D

[3:38:56] Bjuris611: @NoraExplorer It's okay to ask, you're not bothering anyone by just asking
[3:38:59] Ersi_: at first I though it was hardware, something like overheating or something like that BUT when you left the south area it kinda stopped lagging right?? so it seems purely just problem with some textures and stuff like that

[3:39:23] Alezzo: @NoraExplorer The cache is rebuilding since you've wiped it. When moving around on a fast car, you might be triggering a lot of parallel processes, especially in high density areas. Can you test running slowly on foot instead?
