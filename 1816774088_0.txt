[1:33:33] KillScotty: But then again maybe they just want to farm micro transactions for gta online
[1:33:42] majinrufio23: @killscotty they will probably make fun of it like they make fun of everything
[1:33:48] afk_alien: if rockstar were smart theyd create a bunch of RP servers and charge a subscription to have access to them

[1:36:44] iAmBLiCKY: think so thats why you can change the size
[1:36:51] LionSuit: ohhhhh

[4:43:09] CamActive_xD: I remember the floppy disk version had a series of questions that only older people could answer, just to verify age to play the game. I remember I spent like a whole day redoing the quizzes just so I can play while my granddad wasn't home.
[4:43:49] KittehKittehPawz: @CamActive_xD what would one of the questions be like?
[4:43:51] g1ftm3ow: amiloDtrain MoneyRain

[4:46:37] g1ftm3ow: EZSteer
[4:46:53] Leisure_Suit_Larry: I hate being looked at as black
[4:46:56] KittehKittehPawz: @CamActive_xD HAHA a very good question tho for its purpose
[4:47:32] CamActive_xD: @leisure_suit_larry being looked at is black isn't all bad. Being as black is simply the absence of color.
[4:47:49] just_peachy_3: That was tight
[4:49:16] Leisure_Suit_Larry: @leisure_suit_larry being looked at is black isn't all bad. Being as black is simply the absence of color.
[4:49:49] CamActive_xD: There are no races. Just the human one. Back when I played WoW, I don't remember the list of races going, "wood elf, high elf, gnomes, humans, and black people."
