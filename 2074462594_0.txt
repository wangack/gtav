[1:15:32] krosswynd: how will u do heist that ask for 250 butcoin all the time
[1:15:34] Marilyn_1020: buttcoin is pricy tho
[1:15:35] Olvi12: @Guielme, everything progress wise has been about coin so far and that seems to be the trajectory. Coin is time gated, money isn't
[1:15:39] OTCountdown: @arq_th_ur Oh gosh, you didn't read what I wrote, I said MOST of the fun stuff, ie heists.  Great job.
[1:15:41] scottysayz: Jason could grind G6, and make $, instead of driving the sani truck for free
[1:15:42] azumibg: sound stupid to me too

[1:16:27] Yudee: Jason is right, even tho people dont see it. If you guys want to do new content you kinda have to grind
[1:16:30] DesignII: @leczxm that didn't sound like he wanted to quit to me
[1:16:31] tryhaaardau: He just wants a 1/2 mil screenshot
[1:16:33] saelufuu: U can just make the butc yourself. 2 days of butc with 1 gpu makes more money than buying for the money u het
[1:16:33] Fabio10296: noraexDance
[1:16:37] Zeynlol: butc is everything you can make the money later
[1:16:38] relentless_: @qhrizo777 its called a discipline, something what our civ gang needs to learn, especially RAIA :)
[1:16:42] rahiraven: The back sitting is crazy

[1:17:23] Phineas05: @VaeelL WhatChamp
[1:17:23] leaavz: lmao
[1:17:23] auxfrog: @yudee i think the confusion is why grind money when they need coin for the additional unlocks
[1:17:24] Olvi12: @leaavz, bruh what is a chat for if not discussion?
[1:17:28] Guielme: @Olvi12 both are time gated bro, you get money by spending time, they are behind and a smaller group, if they try to just all in on coin production when cars are at all time high prices they are just getting more behind, its correct to sell it now and buy 3-4x more when its cheapper, its trading
[1:17:29] Sivvii_: Hmm
[1:17:34] grandnoel: @joebananas68 So? G6 is more beneficial for the gang than driving the truck. He souldnt be bitching

[1:17:52] leaavz: @Olvi12 !meta !backseat
[1:17:58] RaverenZero: tbf the opportunity is to actually cash in the heist money instead of leaving it in the bench.

[1:18:23] NovaSueno: why not do g6 and then drive while on cooldown?
[1:18:24] joebananas68: @grandnoel he will when they go off. he is not bitching XD how sensitive can you be.
[1:18:25] dinherfare: But Everytime Jason bring it up the conversation dies

[1:18:43] eruhen17: @xbigxmikex69 That's epic commitment tbh. I understand you.
[1:18:43] Daloo9: its better that way so no one is locked behind G6 for money
[1:18:44] SpaceG33k: jason just tired of being second guessed all the time
