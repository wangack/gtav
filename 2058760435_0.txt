[0:29:35] theancientones1: Den probably going to be living under that bridge with Johnson because of the pit
[0:29:37] KellBellnf: He wants gross negligence which could take Aziz's job, slacks says he has a case

[0:30:43] lord__hydra: why would he get a dap for that?
[0:30:44] blamhim398645: what happened?
[0:30:44] yattyz: The best part about that pit it only hit him
[0:30:47] ilostuniverse: I'm pretty sure Johnson was his only character
[0:30:47] The_YellowMist: @donovan_salazar1 huh
[0:30:50] chivvyy: u just know certain ppl gonna eat this up tho
[0:30:51] Clivent: there was no other cars. it was a good pit
[0:30:52] MDM4ever1986HD: bad things do happen and Johnson was in the wrong place and wrong time
[0:30:53] steve_more: Pitting is fine, but that was a bad pit let's be honest, was super high speed, and in a horrible place to try it lol
[0:30:53] julieannxox: dean actually writing a report DeanNOWAY

[0:31:16] xXxEV0xXx: @Veonixx I hope not.. I can see if one of the Cpts are in a bad mood trying to push some shit on him. For performing a pit when it was unsafe to do so.. or some crap.
[0:31:18] FilzG: @steve_more approved by aziz i think
[0:31:23] lilboom91: !permit for posting RP clip

[0:31:38] MDM4ever1986HD: @lilboom91 you don't need a permit if sub
[0:31:39] stellarnaut: The difference is typically IRL the person committing the crime gets blamed for damages during a chase
[0:31:41] OwnsJo: Probably shouldn't use the fastest PD car for pitting lol
[0:31:43] keganhussbuss: you have to confirm it‚Äôs a safe place to pit. do you not?
[0:31:45] GilbertGilberto: thats why you dont evade recklessly, because people get hurt EZ
[0:31:50] ramsin50: doesn't a pit have to be from the side

[0:32:09] duvajmikuractwitch: and ramming is just plain hitting
[0:32:10] danielwhite_2007: u pitted at the right speed aswell it‚Äôs not your fault at all
[0:32:12] charlie25253: @greenburg22 he won‚Äôt get hired on a second character
[0:32:12] mavericks312: @ownsjo that‚Äôs stupid cause they wouldn‚Äôt be able to pit the muscle cars
[0:32:13] julieannxox: @Deansocool i sent you a spectrum test

[0:33:48] mavericks312: @ownsjo bro you realize crims have way to much power atm right
[0:34:06] LJD420: slacks telling Johnson he can rehire on another character just rubbing salt in the wounds imo
[0:34:32] 360ski: P.I.T. stands for Percision Immobilization Technique
[0:34:34] marneraiders: => Who approved PBS ?
[0:34:35] MDM4ever1986HD: @LJD420 he's having a rough time irl I've heard
[0:34:49] MDM4ever1986HD: the streamer I mean
[0:34:58] LJD420: jay or saab ?
[0:34:59] xXxEV0xXx: Has Koil been around lately? Havnt noticed him on franny or anything .
[0:35:07] CheeseMongerJet: yeah he got fired irl and online
[0:35:08] MDM4ever1986HD: @LJD420 King
[0:35:11] danielb2705: Make sure you say they kept brake checking you
[0:35:15] CheeseMongerJet: in the same week
[0:35:16] amanmama: @xxxev0xxx probably coding
[0:35:19] Aoniar: @marneraiders Suarez as he was scene lead
[0:35:58] captain_steve_420: @Aoniar Aziz actually approved the pit. Suarez broke off beforehand and gave it to Aziz
[0:36:04] DEVTR0: this chase is like nascar only left turns
[0:36:05] CheeseMongerJet: suarez approved the pit that killed johnson thats poetry honestly
[0:36:06] Dr_Epica: yeah
[0:36:07] OwnsJo: @mavericks312 it is GTA RP - not just police simulator.
[0:36:07] FilzG: going back to the crime scene
[0:36:12] danielwhite_2007: Dean did u have to go through academy in 3.0
[0:36:18] Dutchyy__: you not fired yet?
[0:36:27] amanmama: @danielwhite_2007 yes
[0:36:36] gerkins860: Johnson musta been down bad hanging out under the underpass
[0:36:37] Guz617: do EMS RPers do med reports/logs ?
[0:36:40] MDM4ever1986HD: @Aoniar so we're assuming Aziz will get the daps?
[0:36:50] The_YellowMist: @danielwhite_2007 bring back Ngannu
[0:36:59] FilzG: we never hear Aziz saying he approves the pit
[0:37:05] 360ski: @aoniar it was actually Aziz that said he approved it
[0:37:06] Erohw666: back at the scene of the crime Kappa
[0:37:25] jaydenbarracuda: does he know about Doug?
[0:37:31] captain_steve_420: Aziz said he approved the pit to slacks tho...
[0:37:35] BDG_Toa676: deansoPa
[0:37:40] FilzG: LUL
[0:37:41] Aoniar: @captain_steve_420 I thought Suarez approved went to process a 95 so he gave control Aziz and Aziz didn't say anything about stopping the PBS so it was still allowed
[0:37:44] amanmama: @captain_steve_420 don't meta
[0:37:48] MDM4ever1986HD: Is Aziz allowed to call it?
[0:37:49] The_YellowMist: @guz617 must be a boring job ngl
[0:37:58] stellarnaut: I really hope that nobody gets dapped about approving a PIT that would be kinda ridiculous
[0:38:11] LJD420: so the problem with saying you can reapply on another character is that is basically slacks admitting he was wrong without saying it instead of just owning up to it.
[0:38:15] FilzG: @stellarnaut oh someone will get dapped 100%
[0:38:27] CreoOne: @LJD420 yup
[0:38:31] stellarnaut: Can't just DAP mfs everytime a innocent gets injured unless it was obvious negligence

[1:01:58] TheS1lentPuppet: deansoFitfo
[1:01:58] GilbertGilberto: @SMR026 what kind of mentality would that be for a pd LuL setting examples is mercenary leadership
[1:02:01] mavericks312: bro this is why the pd is in a bad state they keep allowing crims to get away with everything
[1:02:15] a2th3vi: PD is still at the stage of "setting standards" so this will be a DAP for sure

[1:03:13] Adeelsheikhy: I feel like every thing den does ends up as a really big deal in comparison to others
[1:03:13] MexiBrent: this is the reason they call of chases for small things
[1:03:15] UncleJinx: LOL should make a diagram.
[1:03:15] MajorPainCA: The pit was on the straight stretch before the curve.

[1:04:18] FilzG: chat u on crack if you think he's in the wrong
[1:04:20] stellarnaut: Denzel gotta put in the report that there was a pothole in the road or he's OMITTING KEKW
[1:04:24] msblackwiddow: thats why you dont pit unless u can see whats around XD
[1:04:25] Pee_aRe: @Vendatus he was talking to cornwood last night so he not dead
[1:04:26] MajorPainCA: @SMR026 To quote Slacks, "Absolutely".

[1:04:28] xXxEV0xXx: @Takuto819 lol. He wasnt there in my eyes..
[1:04:33] sirbombabba: @UncleJinx He would have got a raise
[1:04:37] mavericks312: shiesty did nothing wrong
[1:04:38] theancientones1: Sounds like an argument to not use pits except for extremely rare instances
[1:04:38] MisterParry: @Juhoze anymore. o7 Johnson

[1:05:25] FilzG: write this down
[1:05:31] sirbombabba: @Morfius53_ intent dose matter somewhat, whats more important is if it was negligence.
[1:05:33] themac250: get a room
[1:05:33] marneraiders: Rewrite your statement
[1:05:38] Troytd: Denzel getting fired will be the start of a 'PD on strike' arc

[1:08:08] stellarnaut: @newtricksterx i wonder if IRL departments put this much thought into stuff when they execute a no knock raid LUL
[1:08:12] MajorPainCA: At the distance the pit was started, it would be difficult to see anyone standing there.
[1:08:21] ramsin50: i hate people wo use exact numbers
[1:08:23] msblackwiddow: i think he will be fine tho,as long as he doesnt lie in his report,Cus he followed orders and he did his job

[1:10:49] fah_q_gaming: but he shouldnt get in trouble
[1:10:58] MajorPainCA: Other than reporting exactly what you saw, you set yourself up in the same situation as Johnson omitting details and called a liar.
[1:11:15] StyxFlick: HE IS IN THE BUSH BEHIND U
[1:11:15] xXxEV0xXx: Wish they wouldnt use the DAPs only to threaten, scare, or punish the officers.. They whole program is intended to help the officers learn from mistakes.. not punish them for either not knowing something or not having the correct or enough training.
[1:11:16] CheeseMongerJet: he was at 90 when he did the pit what is the ruling on that
[1:11:16] marneraiders: Write that down, write that down
[1:11:17] Killsauce: rhodes a real one

[1:12:25] MajorPainCA: The vehicle striking the concrete post was where Johnson was hit.  The body just fly to the right.
[1:12:28] stellarnaut: @majorpainca I hate the "omitting" claim because how is someone supposed to know which details are relevant
[1:12:29] printerman22: o7
[1:12:30] DanLGG: I‚Äôm pretty sure Rhodes is part of the admin team yes

[1:12:54] Pee_aRe: @StyxFlick who?
[1:12:56] kb420ps: @fah_q_gaming I like Denzel, but I agree. I think no matter what they did,  they would have still hit Johnson.
[1:12:57] RobertAB: @AnusReaktorMan No its because the guy that got hit was Johnson and it put him in the ICU KEKW
[1:12:57] CheeseMongerJet: @stellarnaut i mean this is why johnson was fired

[1:18:44] DisConfused: FirstTimeChatter
[1:18:49] denkef: Hmm
[1:18:49] Sonicfear: Pit at 92mph, it's all Johnson's lawyer has to point to and this is over.
[1:19:01] AsuniRS: isnt anything under 100 allowed?
[1:19:03] sillybunbuns: o7
[1:19:05] kb420ps: I don't think that Denzel did anything wrong.  I think his pit move was good,  but that doesn't mean that he can't be DAPed for what happened.
[1:19:05] BaskinLIVE: Man I've been hardcore lurking, but Johnson is definitely the PD Karen in the most respectful kind of way, the dude is hilarious :joy:

[1:19:25] MexiBrent: its all come down to if the Capts see that as a populated area of the city
[1:19:28] sharrkuu: it might be allowed in the SOPs but an argument can still be made over how safe it is
[1:19:29] maofinn: this advice is good
[1:19:30] stellarnaut: @sonicfear that's SOP not case law, what does SOP have to do with court
[1:19:31] d_o_g_o_: @SkinnyNudist think its 100
[1:19:31] Erohw666: I dont know pitting rules in 4.0 but generally, you dont pit in the city doing 92mph >.<
[1:19:31] xxlonegunmanxx: i don't know why PD doesnt have a Union. It's for exactly these cases
[1:19:33] gerkins860: I‚Äôd remove the sidewalk/hobo camp part - shows you understand that you were aware people could be there

[1:20:55] stellarnaut: It shouldn't even matter unless there is a law on the books that says police can't pit at a certain speed, why would SOPs be used in court
[1:20:57] Faildude: @Faildude I mean Johnson lawyer how is he gonna proof what speed he was going
[1:20:58] CTRSWebb: @faildude cars have a thing called a speedometer
[1:21:00] Twin_Hallow: @d_o_g_o_ was someone almost killed that time too lol?
[1:21:00] d_o_g_o_: @Burntnaan earlier he was pitted when entering the freeway
[1:21:01] teebone2: A friend Denzel didn't even go to the hospital to check on,  great friend lol
[1:21:02] Juhoze: Den could have pitted the car at 99mph all legal
[1:21:06] Jaster_Reylu: except u can see from ur vod u were goin 92 mph when u pited them.... not ur lieing on a statement and gonna get fired
[1:21:07] Thraxton1: Eugene wasn't even spiked at 100, he was doing like 75-80 if you check the clips
[1:21:12] gerkins860: remove ‚Äúhobo camp‚Äù and ‚Äúsidewalk‚Äù makes you seem aware that civs would be there
[1:21:22] Pee_aRe: So Sonic you telling me Johnson has a Speed radar on his person to tell the speed Den was driving???
[1:21:23] DanLGG: Denzel needs to get someone like Rhodes or another Senior to be his advocate during questioning. Derollo had Aldo during the whole fuk off situation
[1:21:26] Coop914: The whole pit thing was just an unfortunate accident, nothing more
[1:21:30] kundaimagz: at the Eugene situation he was at like 75
[1:21:36] Buck__Wild: @burntnaan Eugene was going 72 when he hit the spikes. you can see it in clips.

[1:22:25] Sonicfear: @Twin_Hallow Yea my bad, I got Prodigy and NP mixed up...Now I feel likek a dunce for sure. Prod is 80 NP is 100 and yes someone did almost die too.
[1:22:26] chmod_R_777: its about wrongful termination tho... not about "I cant get fired"

[1:24:19] dragonskeld: @FilzG supreme commander crane
[1:24:28] BigglesVII: There is no legislation, their plan is to create it as rp happens
[1:24:29] Emeralblade: but that means that it has to go both ways then? cant pick and choose things to enforce, thats just wrong.
[1:24:32] 360ski: @devtr0 Nick Saban GoatEmotey GoatEmotey
[1:24:38] laniatx09: You put him as an individual
[1:24:41] Juhoze: Do a dry run on your explanation of the situation so you dont get tilted when you get questioned
[1:24:47] marneraiders: Just write a statement for the talks with the captains already

[1:46:10] FilzG: mhm
[1:46:15] DanLGG: I don‚Äôt understand why they need to send experienced cops through academy. Just give them the SOP and any vital changes then get em on duty.

[1:46:56] LJD420: Dean your making too much sense that would never fly KEKW
[1:46:59] sharrkuu: sounds like there were some issues with FTO's picking and choosing their cadets
[1:47:02] jMasters: its just senior officers over looking ftos who overlooking cadets no?
[1:47:05] TheSvess: Have FTOs Teach Officers how to FTO so that more FOTs can take cadets
[1:47:07] painsupreme7: @iJerrBear i dont see ruth or turner on as much just slacks maybe its the time i start viewing
[1:47:08] BDG_Toa676: @ljd420 RT
[1:47:10] Kevz95: @BadRabbits currently its FTOs overlooking cadets, but its bottlenecked bc only so many FTOs, he's saying let regular officers train cadets for now
[1:47:11] DonNiko99: Should be renamed FTM then - Field Training Manager

[1:47:12] wellbigsmoke: @Deansocool you know what buddy, youre so damn right
[1:47:14] BlazeAndConfuse: @FilzG 6 hours of paperwork will do that to you
[1:47:16] kagradarthereal: It also feels like that having 3 people with different views of what that the PD should be and should do is not good. Really need a proper commander to bring everyone together.
[1:47:19] nationas: i dont see anyone being trained rn lol
[1:47:23] sharrkuu: or train more FTOs
[1:47:23] FilzG: true you making too much sense now for the captains
[1:47:24] ItzSayf: that middle cadet reads like CUCKS
[1:47:25] RobertAB: I think it would of been so much smoother if they allowed more high command trasnfer from 3.0, like Snow, and then have them quit once its settled
[1:47:26] UncleJinx: I'm never getting windows 11 That shit look ugly
[1:47:29] jgans2: cadets needs  more help then fto

[1:47:43] Wheez_3D: They are also having issues with money as each academy costs alot but they don't have the funds

[1:48:20] StephyFace: Well, and it helps if people didn't get their way into academy & become cadets, just to stop coming in the city immediately after. Other ppl that will be around coulda been there and been helping already.
[1:48:22] Aoniar: What rank did you get in the army @Deansocool

[1:49:06] xsilas43: KEKW
[1:49:06] kagradarthereal: exactly 3 captains with unchecked power need a supervisor to put them inline. That's the way I see it at least.

[2:57:19] Spaghooters: @riftshadow if someone is tazed it should speed up the skillcheck imo

[2:57:31] Thraxton1: it's not powergaming, but yes the mechanic is trivial and might as well be automatic
[2:57:34] lurkbelow82: breaking cuffs give crims a chance, otherwise it wouldnt be fun for anyone chat, cops got all the advantages on a chase
[2:57:34] RnG_Qwik: @tjey24_11 Absolutely not there was a local there no cheating what so ever

[2:58:04] mavericks312: @lurkbelow82 5 car chases and breaking cuffs every 3 seconds is boring stop it

[2:58:29] Skylo97: @tjey24_11 no it‚Äôs not people it‚Äôs articulated as a local calling in the body. it‚Äôs been around since nopixel 2.0 and isn‚Äôt considered cheating. if I recall correctly koil (the owner) has done it before

[3:23:22] rikaus69: If I was in a police cell and they handed me a bag with something in it to smell.. I'd sniff it all to get rid of the evidence ü§∑üòÇüòÇ
[3:23:29] enjoylife4789: @paxipher never seen a officer give a criminal back evidence just Tbf

[3:23:49] Caeros: @yoseven_teen_38 you'd have to look at your local/state laws for specifics
[3:23:49] duck_puck1: do u guys not have a cap on this shift?
[3:23:50] yassuomana1: G6. Pallet
[3:23:56] PepperAnn131: Ask him if they are his. Maybe he is dumb enough to say no.
[3:23:59] FilzG: G6 Pallet yeah
[3:24:02] m4l1kkk: @rikaus69 if it's sniffable in 1 go then you can argue personal consumption, you'll be fine lol

[3:24:23] timedoggg: @Lucid_Jaydee thats the name they can't rp off that. just the description which is "box of assorted jewelry"
[3:24:25] Paxipher: @m4l1kkk i know because ive been interrogated while extremely intoxicated on substances about 8 years ago. my argument was that i was intoxicated. lawyer told me they can definitely do that, and that cops prefer it.
[3:24:26] loki_sio: Deannooo

[3:27:28] fortnitepro13468: Hii
[3:27:28] Paxipher: @Sonicfear There are laws in place that when a suspect is under the care of a physician/psych/ER they cant be questioned. However, when they get back to the station/go to the station still extremely intoxicated, they get questioned every time.
[3:27:28] TheeFoundingFarters: fun
[3:27:29] d_o_g_o_: he made

[3:28:36] akonv3: @fossabot DAMN
[3:28:37] Paxipher: @Paxipher I cant remember the specific law, perhaps it's HIPPA or another similar law.
[3:28:38] DanLGG: just ask him how many apples he has to have for a bottle lol
[3:28:41] fortnitepro13468: Kreygasm
[3:28:42] sirbombabba: @duck_puck1 irl not in Np
[3:28:51] riftshadow: You would need an expert to say that a moonshine recipe and doubt you have one.
[3:29:03] duck_puck1: @sirbombabba bruh im talkin about the game ofc -.-
[3:29:18] Zanduin: irl cops dont jump through this many hoops and Officer Crane agrees
[3:29:35] Sonicfear: @Paxipher Prolly, that makes sense, because the patient/suspect can't give legal consent while impaired.
[3:29:36] adshotta: This aint irl
[3:29:37] wellie2404: he‚Äôs admitting to making it no?

[3:30:03] tinywulf: gotta keep him awake and moving if you are trying to prevent poisoning
[3:30:21] adshotta: @duck_puck1 they dont when theres plenty of ppl snitching
[3:30:35] Paxipher: @Paxipher absolutely correct. While impaired under the care of a doctor/physician, the suspect cant be interrogated. But if he goes straight from the street to the cells, cops will interrogate the crap of of a criminal.

[3:35:16] guilt_: Of course that's your contention. You're a first year grad student. You just finished some Marxian historian, Pete Garrison prob'ly, and so naturally that's what you believe until next month when you get to James Lemon and get convinced that Virginia and Pennsylvania were strongly entrepreneurial and capitalist back in 1740. That'll last until sometime in your second year, then you'll be in here regurgitating Gordon Wood about the Pre-revolutionary utopia.
[3:35:17] Paxipher: @MattarChawal You're acting like you're 15 years old bud. Chill out. It ain't that serious.
