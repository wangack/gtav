[1:20:08] barmyarmyalien: i‚Äôve not heard of a nice part
[1:20:11] shedoesntloveyou: you'd have to be hella sheltered to not realise this yeah

[1:22:43] guacemolyy: for the little i know about india, theres reason for why some parts are so poor and some parts are so rich and developed. india had a caste system that ruled a lot of their society based on a system where if you have a specific last name or family history, that dictates where you end up for the rest of your life. a comment cant really sum it up, but it was a big deal for centuries
[1:22:43] shadowless_warrior: Like france
[1:22:44] david_sammy: Yay
[1:22:46] drkangel___: they have other ways to make money, scamming isnt justified. Scamming is taking the easy way out because of all the hard workers who actually work for money and not scam people of their life savings
