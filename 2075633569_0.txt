[3:00:04] BobFromAccounts: I feel like Slacks has too much Shift 2 Wild West PTSD to have a real stance on anything which is why he is ALWAYS in the middle of Rooth and Turner

[3:01:24] DonnBeach: @dawnxero Maybe they'll finally notice the pattern
[3:01:30] JoblessGarrett: Garry Berry also suspended himself until review by Garry Berry
[3:01:33] DiscretionaI: 3rd times she has coincidentally disappeared after major incidents
[3:01:33] ShinJiHun: @neonsloths That's an interesting way to frame her stepping down pending the outcome of the investigation OMEGALUL
[3:01:33] 0zarruu: they are literally saying they dont know why she suspended herself yet..
[3:01:41] TimmayHS: this guy is asking some excellent questions, the other 2 didn't attempt to understand things as well as this former sheriff

[3:02:09] Eddie1225: if your stateing an opinion
[3:02:13] rclemon_: @dawnxero Bro wants to be a victim so badly
[3:02:14] neonsloths: @ShinJiHun I am just pointing out the argument could be made. If i were her I wouldn't have stepped down because the negative peeps would portray it that way

[3:02:28] chaosproductions: Better punishment ideas than Daps: 1) Illegal PIT = 1 shift of bicycle duty 2) Stacking charges = 1 shift of paralegal work 3) improper use of force = suspension pending community service hours

[3:02:55] steven__99: @ArdentCause they voted that when it was on the docket she gets suspended, they didnt know she did it without being on the docket
[3:02:57] DonnBeach: @ArdentCause They decided to suspend her if it went to the docket which it has not yet
[3:02:57] JoblessGarrett: I think Owen is just playing devils advocate is trying to understand the system to make it better. It has holes right now and cant have a leaky bucket
[3:03:00] FuZroK: 1 dap = wash PD cars, 2 daps = does it topless

[3:03:46] Bubbasage: @chaosproductions  I believe the server wants a level of seriousness and obviously the police department is the wall of that enforcement. it's just been too heavy handed so far

[4:03:49] trudgener: surely they won’t just blame you anyway

[4:04:31] wolfhall113: @wavep987 Yep, the mayor is going to collect suggestions and send them to the state, then they will both decide on it
[4:04:33] EndoraDC: Thays whats painted on pd walls. Obey and survive

[4:10:10] ArdentCause: even as a captain- did you envision this happening ?
[4:10:10] bioblade: Wt about Robocops?
[4:10:10] weskerpalm: I see where the captains have been coming from, and, regardless, conflict happens in RP. And the RP has been really awesome.

[4:10:19] Switchblade142: I agree but I do think that goes both ways too where they might instead think cops are just boring robots only out for charges

[4:10:50] cruderaven: he just mentioned the inconsistencies are the problem and your explanation proved his point. he wants one person to fix the inconsistencies
[4:11:03] neowizerd: @Phage_Cleaver I know but they are following RP rules. Not everybody has to be funny.
[4:11:05] mizzikk2401: true, but out of personal experience having an ear to the community and having a short talk helps alot too, but that is just my opinion
[4:11:14] condor2104: Exactly
[4:11:17] JesusGVG: people think CoP will be around 24/7 to enforce consistency? OMEGALAUGHING
[4:11:17] neowizerd: EXACTLY
[4:11:21] DanLGG: the city will always blame the PD. I watched a server where the PD literally changed their policing based on who they were chasing and they still got blamed for enforcing punishments
[4:11:24] cruderaven: naw dude i agreee but a singular figurehead with a single vision
[4:11:24] khrow: Nah I'd simply do it :)

[4:11:32] dudemanbroo: why cant people have more free reign to rp the way they want
[4:11:34] JO3Y_C: JO3Y_C subscribed at Tier 1. 
[4:11:36] SojuBorealist: It's rp chat there was and never will be 100% consistency
[4:11:37] Krimson07_: svensen for commissioner !!!!
[4:11:37] ChocolateMassage: so many snakes in the grass
[4:11:38] khrow: Simply make it perfect
[4:11:39] Shaphilly_: saab10 saab10 saab10
[4:11:40] ChrisJx7: "jokes behind closed doors is 1000% okay" daps cornwood and aziz based on knight being a pretty cool guy
[4:11:43] RonJon: have you tried just being perfectly consistent in all situations?
[4:11:44] lizardeyes: cant buy it at lowes dont work
[4:11:44] ArdentCause: so then there should be much more leniency in the aspect of roleplay- especially since it will never be perfect
[4:11:46] Laticore: A singular figurehead was a thing in 3.0 and that shit still didn't work chat please LULW
[4:11:47] Count_Brennuvarg: Promote Duncan to HR Manager @Ssaab
[4:11:48] OGpicklehead: @Ssaab i think part of the issue is crims are given INSANE amounts of leeway with regards to gameplay, but cops are held to a ridiculously strict standard
[4:11:49] xolision: just postpone the treason case idenfintely KEKW someone doesnt come back
[4:11:50] JesusGVG: literally having a CoP never fixed the culture issues between shifts NEVER
[4:11:51] KnightedGames: See slacks is not letting us joke and is not listening to us.
[4:11:51] kowalskithegreat: perfect is the enemy of good
[4:11:51] ArdentCause: sometimes cops just get baited into shit ya know
[4:11:52] Twin_Hallow: I dont think anyone is expecting perfection or anything
[4:11:58] cruderaven: 100% not perfect but one person, one vision, to lead
[4:11:58] ashlynn: Timeout
[4:11:58] KindaTru: Hey guys can joke around in MRPD, but can stand in MRPD you have to go to patrol
[4:11:59] Phage_Cleaver: @neowizerd Correct not everyone has to be funny. But the people that try to be funny shouldn't be punished or discouraged from doing so
[4:12:03] BobFromAccounts: You know he’s right chat
[4:12:04] Eddie1225: chat for people complaining about robots yall sure want everyone to act the same
[4:12:04] steven__99: @ChrisJx7 they were literally making that joke with a suspect, what you on about, thats not closed doors

[4:12:05] Eddie1225: OMEGALAUGHING
[4:12:06] SojuBorealist: @ChrisJx7 They listened to all, get ur facts right
[4:12:15] chaosproductions: @Ssaab Daps are lazy RP. Why cant captains come up with more creative punishments
[4:12:16] xolision: just postpone the treason case indefinitely KEKW someone doesnt come back  @Ssaab
[4:12:26] allenog03: ughhhh, that is a great but real tough question
[4:12:29] Satic: You know who's always consistent and impartial? Chatters
[4:12:31] DonnieRockettt: @Ssaab Do you think an HR can help them out?
[4:12:33] lizardeyes: only tuesday
[4:12:35] ChrisJx7: there were no civs nearby, stop moving goalposts
[4:12:35] JO3Y_C: Love the RP!! Every Captain should have discretion on their shift.. Could be fixed if Officers try their best to work on their shifts due to differences in leadership.
[4:12:36] jersey_jesus: peepoSipSpin
[4:12:40] khrow: You can't, even irl in normal jobs, employment surveys are usually anonymous
[4:12:43] Count_Brennuvarg: @Satic TRUE mhm
[4:12:44] GYNECHIATRIST: that'd be cool i think
[4:12:44] McKibbo: 1 Leader makes the decisions the rest follow, 3 leaders make 3 decisions some follow each of them
[4:12:44] dudemanbroo: @ShinJiHun what I am referring to is specifically PD members. PD has the strictest rule set compared to anything else in the city
[4:12:45] solowanderor: the conflict adds to the RP
[4:12:45] dakota22446: kkonaU ISO plays
[4:12:49] stellarnaut: @DonnieRockettt ill show you consistent and impartial wideduckass
[4:12:50] olofstenkastarn: You should watch the Youtube Link Cornwood sent you. @Ssaab
[4:12:50] S_M_O_K_3__: We need a common enemy. Sanguine 2.0 lets go LUL
[4:12:53] JO3Y_C: You can't save Cornwood if he thinks he can get away with stuff on ur shift that he cant on shift 1 or 3
[4:12:54] GYNECHIATRIST: wideduckass
[4:12:56] neowizerd: @Phage_Cleaver why not? cornwood getting punished for the "one more for sam bass" is completely fine. It's the RP rules to enforce diciplinary action. Shouldn't be mad about that
[4:13:03] jollypnda: damn this audit still going on
[4:13:11] lizardeyes: axiom 3 or 4
[4:13:12] BobFromAccounts: One thing is for sure… if you’re a leader and you don’t hear feedback, you should seek it. cause it’s going somewhere
[4:13:15] steven__99: @jollypnda the audit is gonna be going on for a while

All the police force shouldn't be on patrol all the time because you're only responding to the same things over and over.. Atleast if you have some detectives that just do detective work you can catch up to crims

[5:05:46] ForgottenJones: damn
[5:05:54] duranggo: @KGLynch3 its not poorly written, it is correctly written. Its how literally every possession charge is worded
[5:05:56] Daehv: @timedoggg its how the mechanic was designed
[5:06:04] FuZroK: barking at cops when they should be barking at judges
[5:06:04] Decimated_exo: @kglynch3 court takes into account that it might be planted. it is on defense to prove it

[5:06:04] Bill_Collector: The cops work within the written law

[5:06:08] SXR9: @Decimated_exo it corroborates the fact that the gun could be planted, considering he never fired the gun when they had a shots fired call

[5:07:27] LarconReaper: when do crims get ways to wash off dna in game monkaHmm will be interesting when it does
[5:07:29] Pwnan: They did and they committed crime

[5:07:43] chivo_502: the problem if correct police work would have been done then maybe the truth would have came out.
[5:07:46] FuZroK: @purplepoodle89 Correct. Then the law should be changed. Point being, its not a PD problem. Its a law problem

[5:07:52] GettingToasty22: @neowizerd yeah that will be fun to watch lmfao
[5:07:53] BurgGolf: I mean he is right about spirit of the law. then it should be innocent until@proven guilty. the burden is on prosecution to prove
[5:08:02] timedoggg: also i like how now were going to use discretion now that its cg doing lmao
[5:08:03] Pwnan: Also crime penalties are 5 mins in jail lol
[5:08:03] mika04: @FuZroK setting that precedent has serious implications though
[5:08:04] jollypnda: @bakinpacman dna doesn’t solve a possession charge, because the defense still needs to prove aside person didn’t willfully receive the item
[5:08:08] PolygonStatic: Yeah tons of innocent people getting charged for pd weapons Kappa
[5:08:09] celestedgaf7: The problem with ruling on the letter of the law is that it has twice now thrown out all reasonable doubt raised  during a trail. making the trials feel pointless
[5:08:09] chivo_502: and also others would have been charged ie the shoooter who WAS gsr pos
[5:08:11] Decimated_exo: @chivo_502 truth tho was that it wasn’t planted lol
[5:08:14] KGLynch3: @burggolf completely agree
[5:08:25] MadHuskies: @neowizerd u want a Jayzon Polam server running around
[5:08:25] cmnylHD: LOL I love Aziz
[5:08:26] FuZroK: @mika04 up to judges to set precedence. not cops.
[5:08:28] BakinPacman: @jollypnda but if its in someones inventory it will have at minimum 2 dna
[5:08:30] DaviMury: I agree that the burden has to be on the prosecution
[5:08:32] stellarnaut: i cant believe they planted ammo and magazines and a gun on my guy ReallyMad
[5:08:33] 1n53r7c01n: remember chat its RP, don't get all upset when ya streamer takes an :
[5:08:35] chivo_502: @Decimated_exo ooc thats tru but you cant have dreams and use in game
[5:08:36] 1n53r7c01n: L
[5:08:37] neowizerd: @Pwnan Yeah Exactly and they complain about that too
[5:08:47] WildWillie419: Based on the way the charge is written, the PD proved their case with the photo of K’s inventory
[5:08:50] cruderaven: the ammo should have been the give away lol
[5:08:52] FuZroK: cops enforce the law, the write it
[5:08:53] ArdentCause: LOL
[5:09:03] BulletGorilla: K situation shouldnt be part of this because the gun wasnt planted
[5:09:05] BakinPacman: it will just end up being dna on it if it ever touches your inventory down to shutdown arguments
[5:09:07] jollypnda: @bakinpacman yes but  how do you tell if someone willfully accepts a pd gun vs the pd is planted
[5:09:08] UrbPrime: Susge aziz
[5:09:11] DaviMury: @WildWillie419 That make planting gun very easy for me this is the problem
[5:09:17] cruderaven: rp wise it could have been planted
[5:09:18] chivo_502: @chivo_502 the investigation could have foumd that out is all im sayin
[5:09:20] Decimated_exo: @chivo_502 you saying truth would come out - what alternative truth you imagine?
[5:09:21] Frantzen13: +1
[5:09:30] talamah: WideAmongUsGaySex ffzW WideAmongUsGaySex ffzW
[5:09:30] KGLynch3: it’s why people were so pissed when Murphy got found guilty just strictly because of the precedent it set
[5:09:47] StreamElements: Don't forget to follow the stream if you are enjoying yourself!
[5:09:48] cjohno20: GSR is always first i thoought
[5:09:51] BakinPacman: @jollypnda the RS becomes something different if the pd has to prove both DNA
[5:09:52] cjohno20: oops
[5:10:03] WildWillie419: @davimury that’s where the lawyer is arguing the police should use discretion in pushing the charge - yeah
[5:10:10] talamah: ooc: WideAmongUsGaySex
[5:10:21] purplepoodle89: @cjohno20 they regain conciousness and shoot you while you're performing a gsr test
[5:10:22] Pwnan: That shoot out with jeager was hilarious
[5:10:23] 1n53r7c01n: @KGLynch3 people? or twitch chat? :)
[5:10:30] FuZroK: @WildWillie419 Police should always push charges. Up to lawyers and judges to decide the outcome
[5:10:35] DaviMury: @Pwnan KEKW K was so pissed
[5:10:36] skimomoula7: NotLikeThis
[5:10:37] stellarnaut: @KGLynch3 i feel the only reasonable solution is to make it a expensive misdemeanor and make "criminal use of goverment firearm" a actualy felony
[5:10:39] jollypnda: @bakinpacman with the way LS sees possession it’s in the defense on the pd
[5:10:42] cruderaven: @Pwnan truth
[5:10:47] KGLynch3: @1n53r7c01n people in city lol
[5:10:48] jersey_jesus: YAPPP
[5:10:49] 1n53r7c01n: @DaviMury his chat was worse, :)
[5:10:53] S7VNRedTigers: FeelsDankMan
[5:11:01] WildWillie419: Cornwooding
[5:11:03] PolygonStatic: Duncaning
[5:11:04] cjohno20: Did anyone DNA test that gun?
[5:11:05] DaviMury: @1n53r7c01n Always be like that he has like 20k viewers
[5:11:06] BakinPacman: @jollypnda yeah thats why they will just change it ooc if this becomes a problem
[5:11:07] 1n53r7c01n: @KGLynch3 only a few, not even a hand full... so that don't really matter
[5:11:08] KGLynch3: @stellarnaut  definitely a solution
[5:11:14] purplepoodle89: Cornwood smarter then the PS confirmed
[5:11:15] Pwnan: @cruderaven kinda miss the crim v crim shootouts
[5:11:19] purplepoodle89: PD*
[5:11:28] KnightedGames: I'm the Murphy's case they could have just set the precedent that Judges are peace officers and that would have got around making the planting season a bit.
[5:11:30] limerick2018: That’s a good defence
[5:11:32] chivo_502: @Decimated_exo the fact they didnt investigate whatso ever is the problem
[5:11:36] natrakjartan: but it went to cort and he lost
[5:11:36] axlbv: can anyone ever be charged with possession if it would be like this?
[5:11:40] natrakjartan: and got appeled and lost
[5:11:42] CuBanMumzy: this is where we are going?
[5:11:45] boobysmoke: how did this turn into a legal debate?
[5:11:46] cruderaven: @Pwnan it'll come back just a slower meta
[5:11:47] 1n53r7c01n: @axlbv yes
[5:11:51] mika04: @FuZroK I thought you were talking about the outcome of the trial but even still officers have to consider what will stick in court
[5:12:04] solowanderor: Cornwood does have hindsight as well
[5:12:06] jollypnda: @bakinpacman true but people have to use what current ic laws apply
[5:12:11] stellarnaut: @chivo_502 there was literally nothing to investigate LSPD has no forensics
[5:12:12] Decimated_exo: @chivo_502 but what is the truth that would be found out if it was investigated?
[5:12:17] chivo_502: how do you take a statement on scene from an eye witness and not gsr
[5:12:18] TeeaHeCee: But the GSR shows that K wasn't in the shootout then
[5:12:21] cjohno20: with what gun does the PD think K was shot with?
[5:12:22] Pwnan: @cruderaven ya I know we in the yap meta but still great stories
[5:12:24] LoneSoldier021: No one was charged for shooting someone...
[5:12:25] UrbPrime: LUL
[5:12:30] ChilledChamploo: lol this conversation again
[5:12:30] S7VNRedTigers: +1
[5:12:36] RonJon: @cjohno20 Yaeger's
[5:12:38] FuZroK: @mika04 They should legally push charges. Not push anything that isnt real. Point is the cops arent judges. They just enforce the law as its written
[5:12:44] natrakjartan: these dickriiiiders are crasy
[5:12:45] BroKnives: so is telling someone to fuck off enough to just stop investigating them?
[5:12:47] Decimated_exo: @chivo_502 i need to know alternative world truth pls
[5:12:50] cruderaven: @Pwnan thats what i'm saying the rp has been great
[5:12:52] jersey_jesus: Are they trying to get K exonerated?
[5:13:00] chivo_502: @Decimated_exo maybe the actual shooter may coaberate the story of k
[5:13:08] stellarnaut: the context was the statement and he got shot xdd
[5:13:11] purplepoodle89: our chat was all the RS we needed
[5:13:14] zeike_nz: Which was Barry's statement?
[5:13:21] 1n53r7c01n: also chat, RP law is not IRL law, remember this
[5:13:24] cjohno20: And there was a victim shot on the ground
[5:13:34] Pwnan: @cruderaven very good rp can't be all car chases all the time gets boring story makes chases so much better
[5:13:41] Decimated_exo: @chivo_502 ye they would say k held up yeager and the shot him, whats next?
[5:13:41] SXR9: there wasnt armed robbery for JP lol
[5:13:43] duranggo: shots fired not dangerous?
[5:13:46] purplepoodle89: @1n53r7c01n yes and biase is totally allowed
[5:13:51] Switchblade142: Doesn't terry v ohio require "armed AND presently dangerous"? Does the person incapacitated on the ground constitute dangerous?
[5:13:55] CuBanMumzy: @jersey_jesus it appears so, even though the court found him quality
[5:14:00] talamah: Chatting
[5:14:08] 1n53r7c01n: @purplepoodle89 " based on IRL, not actuall laws "
[5:14:09] chivo_502: @Decimated_exo so your saying dont investigate further?
[5:14:11] BakinPacman: it does give the officers the reason to search
[5:14:11] DaviMury: This lawyer guy is convincing me
[5:14:12] CuBanMumzy: guilty
[5:14:18] Bill_Collector: Ask questions
[5:14:22] farclarity: talk to people
[5:14:22] duranggo: @Switchblade142 no its possibly aren't and potentially dangerous, if they are armed and dangerous you have PC for a full search
[5:14:22] Bill_Collector: Investigate
[5:14:27] Pwnan: Good lawyer then haha
[5:14:38] natrakjartan: these guys are jokes
[5:14:38] stellarnaut: @Bill_Collector frisking IS a investigation!!
[5:14:39] blowaways: but they only searched one person lol
[5:14:40] BakinPacman: they need to remove everyone else from the equation
[5:14:55] blowaways: if it was he says she says, why did they only follow up one side of the story
[5:14:56] tquidtv: pat down
[5:14:56] farclarity: i think k/ramees biggest problem was the other parties not being detained/gsred when k and ramee both were
[5:15:04] jesscdcc: i love how yall started with a house robbery and classic  cornwood rabbit trails
[5:15:04] psicosmoker1979: he said is work dont cut corners
[5:15:04] cary7: Chatting
[5:15:11] stellarnaut: police need to investigate but they cant investigate ME ReallyMad
[5:15:11] tquidtv: 100 percent shots fired you can pat down everyone at the scene
[5:15:14] TheOGWombat: why wasn’t Mary taken to the cells and interviewed?
[5:15:16] chivo_502: @farclarity exactly biased police work
[5:15:18] BroKnives: thats how it works though. no witnesses means its a higher chance of getting away.
[5:15:20] purplepoodle89: @blowaways they had their mind made up before the investigation
[5:15:21] Decimated_exo: @chivo_502 where is am saying that? you saying investigation would show the truth, im asking you for fifth time what is that truth
[5:15:23] GettingToasty22: @tquidtv thanks mr cop
[5:15:25] Anonymousv8: We want you to do investigations but not when we do bad
[5:15:29] Switchblade142: @duranggo I mean I guess it comes down to how you articulate it but i don't know how that works if they're incapacitated that you can argue they're dangerous
[5:15:34] farclarity: pat down THIS
[5:15:45] Bill_Collector: Xavier is good
[5:15:50] blowaways: @purplepoodle89 i think thats what cornwood/xavier was saying. its not about not getting caught, its bout having a fair shakedown
[5:15:53] FuZroK: @farclarity D: dont touch me there LUL
[5:15:57] chivo_502: @Decimated_exo i never said truth everyone knows the truth but it could have helped either way.
[5:16:01] jesscdcc: chat please stay comfy toonyComfy  i wanna be able to chat geegaStare
[5:16:02] 420warlock: only Mr. k and friends get that
[5:16:05] blowaways: crims know they'll get caught, but they want it to be fair
[5:16:16] cjohno20: YOu need RS to detain someone
[5:16:22] hawkeye69r: If the verdict is guilty, isn't it likely that police had a valid reason to push that charge
[5:16:23] stellarnaut: it has to be a violent crime no?
[5:16:31] purplepoodle89: honestly? I don't care
[5:16:31] duranggo: @Switchblade142 if they aren't legally dead, they are potentially dangerous: its why cops cuff and search suspects that are literally bleeding out or missing half their head.
[5:16:38] Decimated_exo: @chivo_502 dud, your exact logs “it would uncover the truth”
[5:16:49] mika04: @FuZroK if that were the case then stacking wouldn't be a punishable offense also you have to remember it isn't real life liberties need to be taken for things to function
[5:16:51] Pee_aRe: Like when people claimed Ramee shot them and wasn't detained or frisked
[5:16:53] jesscdcc: monkaHmm
[5:16:55] Niccson98: chat relax its just pixels
[5:16:59] BakinPacman: with the new placement of items that would be interesting to bring up LUL
[5:17:00] Switchblade142: @duranggo i mean yeah it makes sense, i guess it just depends on how you articulate it
[5:17:06] Bill_Collector: @niccson98 everyone is chill
[5:17:13] chivo_502: @Decimated_exo yea could either hurt k and help cops or hurt cops and help k is what i mean by truth
[5:17:19] purplepoodle89: 6 dead+robbed cops = worth it for catching mr. k on some bullshit
[5:17:21] cjohno20: If the PD doesn't need RS get ready for 0 interaction and pure 10-80s
[5:17:33] jesscdcc: geegaNODDERS
[5:17:35] Decimated_exo: HUH
[5:17:40] FuZroK: @mika04 Just saying the cops dont write the laws on NP. So arguing with the PD is pointless
[5:17:42] blowaways: you're already talking to him conrwood
[5:17:43] Bill_Collector: Making a felon out of a civilian is one of the worst things a cop can do imo
[5:17:47] cjmkr: @purplepoodle89 'on some bullshit' just shows how bad the pd r if they cant do their job right
[5:17:49] chivo_502: @chivo_502 andor remove any doubt
[5:17:56] BigBlue31: incoming 8 hour discussion
[5:18:03] duranggo: @Bill_Collector felons are still felons
[5:18:05] TeeaHeCee: LololoL.  Save his job.  We need Cornwood back
[5:18:06] jesscdcc: FirstTimeClassic
[5:18:16] stellarnaut: @cjohno20 crims are gonna 10-80 anyway. Okay guys these guys had RS we not gonna run CAUGHT
[5:18:19] BroKnives: @Bill_Collector real and true. the planting thing will get out of hand if it isnt addressed.
[5:18:20] Bill_Collector: @duranggo obviously I meant wrongfully
[5:18:26] BakinPacman: cant trust any lawyers after what just happened LUL
[5:18:32] Eddie1225: mfs run from traffic stops

[5:18:56] Bill_Collector: Cornwood out here doing pr
[5:18:56] jollypnda: I mean I’d say a good bridge to build would be adjusting the warrant system
[5:18:58] purplepoodle89: @BakinPacman cops* judges* , lawers are the only ones not lieing
[5:18:59] jesscdcc: mhm
[5:19:03] stellarnaut: @Eddie1225 RIGHT?!
[5:19:05] LluagorED: Cornwood W. More outreach is good
[5:19:08] Stagnation: @Eddie1225 to be fair, i'd run too if i thought i had a warrant
[5:19:11] shabegauabev1201956: is it ooc podcast?
[5:19:13] TeeaHeCee: Press secretary.  Or maybe allow Nakoda to speak up at council meetings
[5:19:18] Eddie1225: @Stagnation most of them just run to run
[5:19:19] Eddie1225: OMEGALAUGHING
[5:19:22] jesscdcc: @Eddie1225 dentt  idk what that means
[5:19:31] Bill_Collector: -100 speech basically
[5:19:33] mika04: @FuZroK not saying they do but they need to be selective about what they choose to push
[5:19:38] Eddie1225: @jesscdcc its a chase
[5:19:47] Pepega_Pirate1: PepePls
[5:20:01] BurningFlag: PepePls
[5:20:02] purplepoodle89: @mika04 they just push EVERYTHING that's how they've been trained, W chasing

[5:20:09] shabegauabev1201956: LUK

[5:20:21] BDubs7769: PD had no problem making an example out of Denzel
[5:20:22] jesscdcc: @Eddie1225 thanks eddie as always NODDERS
[5:20:24] wavep987: Then that;s on Oliver
[5:20:30] Stagnation: @Eddie1225 yea that's also true, especially those damn "The Manor" british people lol. i think they're treating NP like GTA Online.
[5:20:32] shabegauabev1201956: sureeeeeeelyyyyy
[5:20:37] ChilledChamploo: yap
[5:20:44] 404Connor: did he just refer to himself in 3rd person? KEKW “that’s why Cletus was mad”
[5:20:44] cjmkr: @Eddie1225 'traffic stops' you mean > stolen vehicle > police officer asks them to step out so that they can  obviously detain them > pikachu face when crim doesnt step out > police chase
[5:20:51] Bill_Collector: That only happened because Cletus freaked out
[5:21:41] cjohno20: Did anyone have the prosecutor go over any other officer's incidents? Or just Cornwood's
[5:21:54] FuZroK: @purplepoodle89 why have cops at all? just let the crims do whatever they want
[5:22:03] FuZroK: LUL
[5:22:05] 1n53r7c01n: @cjohno20 and what difference would that make?

[5:24:21] s0ggybreads: xdd
[5:24:39] layla109: @Bill_Collector Even so he shouldn't have disclosed that to the Mayor as if something's official. That's bad faith too.
[5:24:43] ChilledChamploo: yap

[5:25:51] eiyzen: what case?
[5:25:58] Stagnation: @nickgmiller the thought process was there's no way anyone should be rushing a murder case of that much importance for any reason
[5:26:00] GettingToasty22: doesn't even wait for a response lmfao
[5:26:08] cjohno20: The sense of urgency came off as pressure
[5:26:11] Phage_Cleaver: Arthur thinks slacks was being malicious because of the wording Slacks used at Moseleys. Slacks made a mistake with his wording
[5:26:12] Bill_Collector: Slacks was a bit rushed and hyped up at that time with Turner there too
[5:26:17] nippynoodles: didn’t he ask questions before highering and paying him?

[5:29:29] layla109: @Stagnation What do u mean why not? Even if PD was malicious to prosecute, two wrongs don't make a right. Secondly... Uhm there's the legislation that just passed giving the Mayor some oversight into PD. That same authority that the Mayor then used to save Cornwoods job.
[5:29:34] Decimated_exo: @stagnation you don’t go to other side with a privileged informationlol
