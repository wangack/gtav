[4:10:04] AWildChocobo: game freak is incompetent
[4:10:05] jaxkmurphy: because Pokémon is for kids @kyle simple as that
[4:10:05] wildfathom: nintendo has billions, theyve had lawyers looking into palworld for months. if they could do anything they would have already
[4:10:05] Timmo001: Because nintendos consoles are dogshit
