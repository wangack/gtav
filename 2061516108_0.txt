[3:43:16] Bruvverbean: english are very monotone
[3:43:57] themohock: its the difference in inflection, hours of joking before conditions the mind to associate that voice with joking, then a sudden changes trips the brain up
[3:44:29] Chritters: Sometimes it's 100% a joke. Sometimes it's self deprecating and making fun of herself when she would be angry. Other times she's actually angry. So, I think its just hard for someone who can't read it to know which it is.

[3:46:03] nieriel__: if I didn’t watch you when it happens sometimes I think as a view I’d have a hard time. so hearing you laugh ooc helps me.

[3:47:06] Cormission: In Scandinavia we use sarcasm a lot, but we also have a very different tone/infliction to it, so it might just go over his head
