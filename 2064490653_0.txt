[1:44:03] McNugg33t: hahahaha
[1:44:16] sshineysean: selling a used, 84% engine for 8K profit is a no brainer, imo.

[1:46:04] Moobs_: The car might be worth more now since the model changed since you bought. Not sure if it's the same as dab's, but he paid $50k retail for his a few weeks ago

[1:47:09] teddybear7012: Looks like a porsh
[1:47:20] Sneaks: makes no sense to have a 2 seater as your only car specially needing to go off road for moonshine
[1:47:23] RaptorQuiz: 2 seater? Useless for most applications
[1:47:33] BillsMafiaSTF: K needs his Warthog haha
[1:47:42] dredre88011: @shotz automatic or clutch
[1:47:45] eaglezFly: upgrade to the baller maybe

[1:47:49] dpbjiio3420: no motorcycles?
[1:47:50] ItsAHazardLife: @moobs_ that's how I feel is the car is limited, out of stock and the price probably is at least double. He'd be selling it short. Plus have to spend more on a new vehicle. 30k would be a bad deal
[1:47:51] everplayz101: TEST TEST
[1:47:55] sshineysean: 4 seater a MUST
