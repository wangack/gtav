[1:57:15] mollytea_: tbh slacks said something about not putting yourself in harm's way or "anything that could jeopardized your job." I think they'd use this as grounds.
[1:57:16] aidybean: Hasn't the precedent already been set with Jon Law and Turgle being convicted with a Stand Your Ground defence?

[1:57:27] myrn9: Yeah that isn't being a vigilante, that is security.
[1:57:28] Craze098: this under NP law would be murder
[1:57:28] Brakon: @EsfandTV they will say you are working in the capacity as a police officer. And twist what you actually did to fit the punishment

[1:57:35] xnicolerose21: @EsfandTV consult ramee about it probably
[1:57:42] NoorIsAwsome: Who is the guy that Cornwood is with? He seems more knowledgeable than a typical taxi driver.
[1:57:43] GHST_DB: oh my god he’s still live
[1:57:45] SurelyBaked: @eduard_lulu correct, but cornwood, who experienced and was the reason for its inception, does. so he knows that it’s going to result in backlash.
[1:57:45] andrlies: @taffletv Reads books while waiting for jobs

[1:57:53] shikari07: You also got 5 DAPS for shooting a 1 lifer on duty. I could see you getting fired for this
[1:57:54] Sweet_BabyJeebus: @EsfandTV you're still a cop though? PD rules still apply during suspension dont they?

[1:59:02] the_main_burt: an idea for this too, instead of waiting in the car jump out with the workers and maybe hide behind a garbage bin
[1:59:02] DestroyDerek: Chat he has a civ license he isn't using his PD weapon license

[4:09:59] mrgrinch421: Donald Bush ? lmao yea, get rid of that guy
[4:09:59] God_is_a_cat_girl: technically it is because it's on them to prove the extra bullet did anything, or even hit rofl

[4:10:26] god_awful_gamer: Your trying to RP an out of game reasons for killing someone who wanted a one life character killed. shooting him was fine, but one tapping him was typical Cornwood Chaos reaction.

[4:11:11] taraannee: where’s lenny’s daps?! he shot someone 6 tips & pitted someone into a river ?!
[4:11:11] Der__Kaiser_: Or when Turner caught them playing with the guns on the meeting room, should he been suspended for that?
[4:11:12] MahanGM: bones a Ratge   chat?
[4:11:12] iwannanuhh: There has been so many times cops have used excessive force at this point yet corndog is the only person running 5 daps for it
[4:11:12] kylef_: i'm surprised on bones take, he seemed like the type of guy that would want more sbs and not take it as serious imo

[4:11:25] rukiddinorly: cornwood needs to think more like a defense lawyer
[4:11:26] colehoward710: This dude would go and and lock up an innocent old lady he knew did nothing wrong if Ruth or slacks told him to
[4:11:27] AtomicAtrox: The DAP system is broken.  It needs to be revised or a new system needs to be in place.  Like the way they throw DAPs out at the very least reduce the falloff rate to 30 days because many of these DAPs could have been warnings or a convo like the hat or vest.

[4:11:31] jd2881: Bones isn't about the PD drama. Dude just wants to chase people and drive fast. Tell him about the turbos and let him get back out there.
[4:11:32] Tenkaru: The problem is Den followed Sop afterwards and still got a dap for it @EsfandTV
[4:11:32] shin5sato3: is 5 DAPs the standard for "excessive force"? or is the number of DAPs up to discretion?
[4:11:33] jonnyman4: so nones never pits
[4:11:33] soosmaz74: what has happened to the bones i knew

[4:12:34] Broosh: @LandanTheSnowman I think Esfand said it best.  If they wanted cops to follow the law to the T, then they should just have local cops.  Otherwise there NEEDS to be discretion in PD, and the PD currently does not give discretion.

[4:12:51] Shonuff_: Ruth still thinks that Cornwood should be charged with murder LULW it;s going to be a juicy captains meeting review

[5:01:31] PicklemanJaro: @esfandtv what's the nuke Aziz sent?

[5:01:40] Vexamas: You'd be so much better off trying to articulate the 5 daps is too many, rather than the crime is unjust, almost no main RPer agrees with the second line, but I think almost everyone would agree that 5 is excesive.

[5:01:58] taraannee: turner was the one calling ruth out for being shady & overstepping!! bring him back!!
[5:01:59] ChitChilli: I agree wholeheartedly, but I also think this creates more content for you too. you have the contacts to do everything
[5:02:01] rando_mug: ruth has said ooc "rp > content", its a whole thing
[5:02:01] tinnyzero: Mafia cop

[5:02:03] Dumboodaking: @EsfandTV what can you do RP wise if there is no one is above them
[5:02:04] DaltonIRL: @esfandtv agreed with the 1 dap for Sam bass but it’s hard to argue that when they give people a fucking dap for running in the pd…clown system
[5:02:05] keslo914: @esfandtv when hosting DnD sessions for my players I always discourage meta gaming but there IS such a thing as healthy meta gaming
[5:02:05] neowraithx: she is approaching it as a thing the old failed pd would do
[5:02:05] emhtiwedir: she’s is power hungry and thinks she runs things.
[5:02:06] KingKova: @hellicross Ruth is destroying content
[5:02:06] KooterNoodle: RUTH IS ABOUT TO BE SAM BAASED
[5:02:06] StormiNyan: cheever is great tho but ruth is not she has to go
[5:02:06] GhostyyEUW: We need BCSO
[5:02:07] Map_Of_Your_Head: comes down to what balance of fun vs "real" rp should the server have. the pd seems like a real job LUL
[5:02:07] Frozen_Tundras: The problem with Ruth is there's no accountability currently for that type of character. She just ruins the PD without any chance of consequence.
[5:02:08] DieterK: @esfandtv arrange a meeting with slacks so that he hears it from these people and not from you
[5:02:08] ChiliDogLarry: just like OOC, different shifts talk trash about each other
[5:02:08] Kalious78: You ain't been charged yet..... you think 5 daps is the full punishment @esfandtv ?
[5:02:08] AndreSays: @esfandtv I'm pretty sure you shouldn't have 10 daps because of fall off. I think slacks didn't realize. You should verify
[5:02:09] brikbeans: it will foster a toxic community of bitches who make a Russia during cold war type energy
[5:02:10] rocker22_: what is the nuke aziz sent you?
[5:02:11] biscuitz1776: it really is madge at popular strimmer
[5:02:11] geo_logic_: and they seem oblivious to it or just dont care
[5:02:11] panhever: Nothing against Cheever but if the server is REALLY content based then her character no longer fits as she only promotes soulless robots for PD which is goddamn boring
[5:02:12] wavy__________________: Ruth even told that Slacks messed up on K's case because he's doing too much
[5:02:12] Superultraman7: hope it gets less creisi and all that for you man
[5:02:13] knowlightnofear: Shift 1 Gang

[5:02:16] MillerThyme: SAY THE SAME STORY AGAIN LULW
[5:02:16] aviditi: There is an OOC clip of Ruth saying she goes for RP Immersion over Content. That just fundamentally does not fit the purpose of No Pixel
[5:02:17] Short_Film: clip of the kill?
[5:02:17] jessielight: you have to come at it from the outside
[5:02:17] chopsuey84: @EsfandTV The Captains are not treating it as a content server

[5:02:17] AngeloJulius: Ruth rules
[5:02:18] CrystalDimension: YEP you

[5:02:21] flyinhawaiian74: need Soze back
[5:02:22] RobRoads: Is a joke. Ssaab and Cheever hare trying to turn this into THEIR PD. Wonder how many viewers they both get now that dean is gone.. Love to see the analytics. Thats for aoof, buy why is this happeneonmg
[5:02:22] ShadedCast: nah, sam bass both ruth and Slackser
[5:02:22] MiyaYuie: pd civil war, I cant wait
[5:02:24] Lord__Gen: Commisioner Cornwood has my vote
[5:02:24] fie17: Let's be honest, Ruth does not prioritize "content" into the policing equation whatsoever
[5:02:24] warhawk384: I think PD is being played like it is on super serious RP server, while the rest of nopixel is a fun/content based rp server
[5:02:26] TopicTech: that’s what thr mayor is doing
[5:02:26] got_rolled: checks and balances
[5:02:26] iii_governor_iii: what it was never Ruth, but slacks
[5:02:27] the_poff: @EsfandTV so what point does content crossover to when Real admins make decisions OOC. thats kinda my conflict on it
[5:02:28] Brakon: its also screwed Deanscool from playing his cop

[5:02:31] twilightbaseballscene: honestly slacks is dropping the ball too. he just gaslights everyone now lol
[5:02:31] Obsoleet442: @esfandtv Is there a police union?  You can be union lead and whenever someone gets wrongfully terminated or suspended, go on strike with everyone
[5:02:32] Aaron__CS: sniffthenewchatter

[5:02:41] Vikairius: It's not Ices fault for sure
[5:02:41] the_bud_spud: Do you think taking the Turbos might lose Cornwood some support in the PD? @Esfand
[5:02:41] doinx: @MillerThyme you do realize if its that big of a problem for you to hear him talk while streaming, you dont have to watch right?
[5:02:41] shin5sato3: Ruth is trying to get Cornwood for murder
[5:02:41] MrDher: @EsfandTV Cheever talked OOC that she doesn't care about content

[5:02:42] singsyng: it doesn't matter that it's not his fault, he should be replaced if he can't do the job
[5:02:42] Gachiguru: They are going against the ethos of the server @EsfandTV
[5:02:42] Shakestar: Turner kept Ruth in check in the Captain meetings
[5:02:43] captain_steve_420: I think the minute someone is a higher rank than Ruth, she will quit. Ruth wanted to quit a few weeks ago but Aldo talked her out of it. @EsfandTV
[5:02:43] illuvramee: Yeah brain doesn't even play anymore. He plays as thugz more often now.
[5:02:44] emhtiwedir: emhtiwedir subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Ruth is running on a high of having power and being a top dog for once in her life
[5:02:45] k9_goliath: Cornwood should hang out at City Hall.. being at PD while on suspension is sad
[5:02:45] crescenterra: @EsfandTV ok it's not Xiceman's fault but if he can't be there then someone else needs to be appointed to step in for him, no?
[5:02:45] Sussy__Sushi: cornwood slightly hearing ruth talk about cornwood being a bad look for the pd this morning was crazy
[5:02:46] heartsonlysoren: Max was totally right to say it was negligent to not have a temporary replacement
[5:02:47] sterred: @EsfandTV Whats sad is your not even going to get a chance to be around :(
[5:02:48] demugglefy_me: You mean like a puppet master who operates a puppet master?
[5:02:48] Wandering_Ranger: 100% agree. I think most of these issues are because there are 3 different people leading. We need a Chief, or commissioner is a good alternative if done well
[5:02:48] BoozeMarlin: this NP 3.0 reboot has been wild

[6:32:43] ip33fr331y: Perjury is taken incredibly seriously in American law. If an attorney knows that perjury occurred, they have an absolute accountability to report it to the judge. There is not even a gray area with that.

[6:34:14] fueledbyburd: Mason hit Archie
[6:34:18] HoneyBK: ^^

[6:34:24] matanzlatan2000: @HoneyBK this is better measured by how much blood, if its not a lot of blood like something thats nose bleed then yeah thats valid but if its a lot of blood then its clearly from a serious wound which is in this case stab wound.

[6:35:04] MysticCasey: No there was blood. That could be from Mason hitting Archie
[6:35:05] ip33fr331y: if Cornwood suspects that his client lied, he would be smart to start distancing himself from this case.

[6:45:12] OniZetsumei: reckless "heedless of danger or the consequences of one's actions; rash or impetuous."   Premeditation "the action of planning something (especially a crime) beforehand; intent."   Reckless is an antonym of premediation

[7:50:54] sholland: Sounds like we need the CORN COB Union
[7:50:54] Flombii: how will this affect lebrons legacy ?
[7:50:55] Fozenoh: Sadge
[7:50:56] RicoLoco52: @Alkemiee it's not as fun to everyone else in the PD when they play with the department like they're doing.
[7:50:56] blackjcks: I feel like most these rp servers push actual rping cops out for cops who are basically npcs

[7:51:07] CopperKat: @angel_ofmercy I think the devs already track time clocked into a job it would just need to be made visible to the captains. It could be coded to be automatic too, X number of hours drops 1 DAP automatically. It could be completely automated after you enter the DAP number.
[7:51:08] Melonchipz: almost feels like they want cops to just be like in game NPC cops
[7:51:11] MarvMelody: ReallyMad

[8:56:59] RajeshRaheim: @JoblessGarrett TRUE AND REAL
[8:57:00] matanzlatan2000: @zy7yz this just increases the chance with the split bettween PD and mayor who is on cornwoods side.

[8:57:10] NasrulAshr: @vanguard771 i see so like people who have dap cant run for the voting?
[8:57:11] CopperKat: Propose DAPs fall off based on hours on duty instead of IRL days that only incentivize people not to get on duty?
[8:57:12] Thebreadlord: is that the same guy who plays Jimmy?
[8:57:15] omn___i: @joblessgarrett Aware

[8:57:27] PappaMidNight: @SkinnyE816 you mean crimwood
[8:57:31] MahanGM: people with daps can't be voted for sheriff?
[8:57:31] Architank: @NasrulAshr That's their intention. They want PD to select the candidates.
[8:57:32] TheSoldier1851: it's Malton. Generalemu is the streamer
[8:57:34] Drizzle1390: lawyer and judge arc would be fun to watch and then run for sheriff when that happens

[8:57:39] BobFromAccounts: It is the guy who plays jimmy 2 times… so what?
[8:57:39] Badass_Hobo: @Maz0hyst Its gonna be tough but cornwood is a tough guy Smadge
[8:57:40] Recktangle69: Cornwood should open up burger shot if he gets fired
[8:57:42] shesamaniac: I want to know maltons personal opinion on the PD from an outside perspective
[8:57:43] Serakkis: @CopperKat such a better answer for the DAP issue
[8:57:48] hellicross: Judge Cornwood could be fun
[8:57:51] Bubba91171: Hmmm seems like they are suspending or firing people to keep them from becoming a commissioner or Chief
[8:57:55] yxng_paige: @Thebreadlord yes malton and jimmy are generalemu
[8:57:56] Ganelon: @wandering_ranger not typically but they do go out to scenes and stuff.  but usually it's more of an in house desk job.
[8:57:57] Usahi_Light: if there WAS a board they would've kept him in lol
[8:58:00] Architank: Cornwood as head of the BAR would be hilarious if it gave him power over Ruth
[8:58:05] zombyfart: Ramee complaints, lol
[8:58:07] TheHawksTalon: Civilian oversight committee ?
[8:58:14] VincentsDeath: i think the commissioner should take the place of the PD Liaison but with the authority to do with out the need to ask
[8:58:16] Thebreadlord: @yxng_paige gotcha thanks, I thought so!
[8:58:19] realitywolfdog: Now Cornwood is a Lawyer

[8:58:32] CrystalDimension: @Nahku true. Especially that all of them are talking OOC and NP is content oriented so there are scenarios prepared. This happening to Cornwood might be part of the show for all we know shrujj
[8:58:34] dallkionn: PD without Cornwood is just a bunch of Egomaniacs LUL
[8:58:34] Atomicor: Head of the Bar is head of Oversight Commitee?
[8:58:36] HashtagSoBlessed: I mean the Sheriff is an elected position… LSPD firing Cornwood wouldn’t lock him out of that so he still has that route right

[8:59:15] BigglesVII: @HashtagSoBlessed It may as the capts want only serving pd to be eligible. But we will see
[8:59:16] ItzAHoax: Sheriff Cornwood and Undersheriff Andrews. Thats that.

[8:59:55] ChainOfLightning: @MahanGM yeah she fucked it up
[8:59:56] DanLGG: The two biggest PD complaints have always been robot cops not Characters and PD doesn’t have consequences but now we’re punishing the character cops lol. Some of the “daps” are justified but fired and suspension is crazy
[8:59:57] Jrey000: @MahanGM she gave everyone daps what  do you mean she has done alot LULW
[8:59:57] dallkionn: @MahanGM nvm them LUL

[9:00:53] puppietreats: @psychojoker obsessed with it honestly
[9:00:58] BigglesVII: @HashtagSoBlessed Its different this time around. At present the capts are in complete control of the pd. That is why the mayaor made the document on screen to try and bring some more control to the council.
[9:00:58] Fabushki: @yxng_paige yeah but what does bar stand for

[9:01:09] dj1ights: @kowalskithegreat he was the police commissioner for 2.5 years on nopixel and he has just about more experience than anyone on the server trying to balance the 'quality of life' between cops and robbers
[9:01:09] Fabushki: oh

[9:01:44] Ganelon: @nahku I think one issue is there's GTARP that people are here for but some Police seem to be playing Real Life PD Simulator and it's not meshing to a degree... I mean that's just my take, all the characters played so far are good though.
[9:01:50] re_quake: sherrif and chief would be better yea
[9:01:51] HashtagSoBlessed: @bigglesvii That’s what I’m saying though. Mayor and council are pushing to take that power out of the captain’s hands so it leans in Cornwood’s favor
[9:01:51] EnVx_iAngel: A union really would help. The captains cant decide if that can happen.

[9:02:11] M00zzy: @God_is_a_cat_girl LUL
[9:02:11] Crowzone80: I think the shift captains should become lieutenants, with ONE captain over EACH branch (LSPD > LASO > Paleto?) then Sergents over Senior and Regular officers

[9:02:16] ip33fr331y: This feels like watching a slow motion earthquake.

In many games, there are peaceful and strategic ways to navigate and influence the leadership without resorting to non-peaceful means. Enjoy the game responsibly!

[9:17:51] magzony: howdy
[9:17:53] Supibot: recon_xox, 🤖 There is no definitive evidence to suggest that Wendy's burgers specifically make people vomit. It could be due to a variety of factors such as personal sensitivities, food intolerances, foodborne illness, or improper food handling.
