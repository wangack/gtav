[2:44:45] venthegreat: james. I'm the one that made the remarks you've all heard about earlier. I would like to start off with an apology. there was never any intent on being hateful, attacking you, insulting you, etc. in my words. As someone who had been around your channel and videos for close to a decade, I only wanted to express the concern in my heart that's been harbored for a while. I am not afforded the privilege to watch many, if any, of your streams, so I am not able to see you in all the inbetween..

[2:44:53] venthegreat: My opinions were misguided, I only had half the picture. I am not able to see the "you" that you primarily cast to your audience. But that is not to excuse what I've said. I didn't try to get the whole picture before making now-baseless assumptions. I have a great deal of respect for, and I apologize for seemingly pissing all over it. That was never my intent, and if you can't/won't forgive me, then I can accept that.
