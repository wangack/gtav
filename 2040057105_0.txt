[2:09:31] mrperson1234: @delboy2016 it costs 16.6 buttcoin to fill a rack with upgraded GPUs. it Costs 2 buttcoin per rack. You are using 8x the buttcoin and saving up buttcoin might pay off later. The only reason they dont sell buttcoin right now for like 3-5k is because they are wasting it all on the expensive GPUs so they have way less than they should

[10:21:04] BoggyMike: SCHIZO Lang isn't only in RP, but also in the creation of the Big Bang. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of no escape is called the event horizon. Objects whose gravitational fields are too strong for light to escape were first considered in the 18th century by John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace. Holes of stellar mass form when massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle.
