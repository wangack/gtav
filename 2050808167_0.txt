[7:20:50] toastwm: maybe there % only drops when you get close to them
[7:20:51] martymagoo78: it’s maths. if it’s volume pushed. if their 100% represents 1000 bags and your 40% represents 400…. then if you push the same amount your % will increase.. for example if you both push 200, they have 1200 and you 600 so will increase to 50%

[7:24:09] dannypenny89: @rainyaubrey that makes sense, because i don't see weed selling beeing a big money maker

[7:26:05] Scoobymane: like why is it 100% for the turf lol
[7:26:09] wishmaker10: open sandy
[7:26:10] RiasGremoryLoveHer: MAYBE NAMED WEED SALES?
[7:26:11] azdabsttv: is turf rep different then strain rep?
[7:26:14] GAMANTAKA: koosh is the pronunciation
[7:26:15] khrow: Turf rep vs strain popularity
[7:26:15] dasklfjem: is this a casino puzzle
[7:26:17] ThatMadeUWet: Is weed even going to worth it in the long run?
[7:26:18] baesic3: ANITA ia 7%
[7:26:20] xTommyyz: must be bugged
[7:26:20] ButWhyLucas: Might be the territory availability?
[7:26:21] taytoeGG: only strain sold there
[7:26:22] foureyes_tv: Clueless Surely no one know who own Pogo Puff
[7:26:22] SurvivorPlayz999: hire?

[7:26:27] DeStr7: @dasklfjem Dentge
[7:26:30] matchabread: Sam Gaas is not showing up
[7:26:30] skedaddelr: it is the amount pushed compared to who pushed the most, whoever pushes the most is at 100% others compare to it @Ray__C
[7:26:30] Aetholite: Maybe market saturation?
[7:26:34] txccchemicals: CHAT?

[7:26:40] inso17: list of turf is probably the how much is the turf pushing weed
[7:26:42] ProphecyEU: Ray, could you share some insight why the guys dont want to pivot to sandyshores?
[7:26:42] taytoeGG: how popular those turfs are for weeeeed
[7:26:47] ilymiso: did yall ever get mickey in hq?
[7:26:50] ThatMadeUWet: @NoSelfControl tHATS TRUE, STEPPING STONES
[7:26:51] campocruzzz: I think you have selled 37% of their amount of selling
[7:26:53] xanetrose: you could push 10 bags and if no one else is there youll be 100% cuz theres is no one else???
[7:26:53] GordonFreebase: It's probably based on volume pushed through the territory. Hardly anything gets pushed in sandy, so the territories rep is low meaning less rep and payout
[7:26:55] holdmykids: room 503
[7:26:56] ARANDOMSCOTT: wonder if it’s a capacity thing like it’s 100% meaning the weed level is satisfied
[7:27:08] alpasoup1: And Sandy is Far
[7:27:12] nosebeersx: just seems like a rep thing, not a tug of war
[7:27:17] solarsky_0: has the war ended between lang and company

[7:27:24] NerdStrafe: there is still the turf guy rep himself
[7:27:26] ButWhyLucas: Do the company have 2 growers one for each right?
[7:27:27] Tuyioller: the question is if 2 strains can have 100% on the same turf
[7:27:27] WuetendesWiesel: for now
[7:27:28] GAMANTAKA: island domination no?
[7:27:28] kirtinos: lang is a pretty good reason i think
[7:27:32] ThatMadeUWet: Plus nobody like to drive to sandy lolol

[7:27:51] dino_zus: There are 3 strains in Sandy lol
[7:27:55] brittbritt90d: there are strains in sandy which means if you don’t push there the others are going to pass Anita
[7:27:55] Shindzii: o nice
[7:27:55] MajicAfro: competition is good TheThing
[7:27:55] dannypenny89: they have 0 % tho ?

[7:28:12] cbtheg0d: anita is at 100%?
[7:28:13] twiisteddmiindzz: if it was a tug of war wouldn’t it be a total of 100% and not them at 100% and you at 37% for a total of 137? @ray__c
[7:28:14] buyremdesivir: well not really Ray, we are talking about volume of sales
[7:28:15] ganjapanat: PogO jason polam
[7:28:18] trungthiendo: it's because Zaza is sold which is counted but they push reggie
[7:28:19] remmy_6: Vagos & Ballas holding it down
[7:28:20] Mundosaysyourfired: but they all 0 it would be dumb to give up anita just so easily

[7:28:58] rainyaubrey: Im so behind, is Reggie regular?
[7:29:04] akazplays: @rainyaubrey yes
[7:29:05] blazeinferno14: its density based , the top strain will be 100 , for eg at cyprus we have sold 37 zaza for every 100 scooby doo
[7:29:05] ganjapanat: Ray does the company have anita weed grower?
[7:29:05] nosebeersx: sell own strain = zone rep   @Ray__C
[7:29:05] PolishGarnek: There could be in the future
[7:29:10] 1br4h7m: Did u guyz buy the npc with butcoin @ray__c ?

[7:29:25] twiisteddmiindzz: finish?
[7:29:26] taytoeGG: BING!
[7:29:26] sungazoa: so the farm is the risk?
[7:29:27] ragekiiddd: what if the decline on zaza is because you guys sells zaza to other people
[7:29:27] xTommyyz: huh
[7:29:28] FictionK: I think volume is a thing. If one group sells more than other in a turf, they make the others go down
[7:29:28] Micky_Good: Dex selling ZAZA to random ?

[7:29:45] samlecs: have yall gotten back all the zaza from dex he might sell it like reggi
[7:29:46] inso17: you can use anita just to fuck someone up Hmm
[7:29:46] its_russo15: but zaza has been going up and down constantly
[7:29:46] Kswitchin: if your % is going down at night  by  8% doesnt that mean it is literally a tug of war i am so confused
[7:29:48] beannbunnyy: yeah and they took zaza killing ppl in the war

[7:31:02] beeeeeenice: Why don't you sell the same strain in different locations?
[7:31:03] gum1985: you destroy rep AND make money ?

[7:31:14] VictoriaKFC: it gives you more money chat
[7:31:16] TheAirWalker: but why though, customers are still buying the same weed, so why would they be dissatisfied?

[7:31:33] AyyyJakee: dont think so
[7:31:35] GordonFreebase: Not if you pay the 10k to change territories
[7:31:35] WuetendesWiesel: strange system

[7:31:56] alpasoup1: Ppl think it's because the Union ....
[7:31:57] Kswitchin: how do you explain it going down 8% last  night?
[7:31:58] ButWhyLucas: Damn you guys fucked yourself Sadge
[7:32:00] RiasGremoryLoveHer: maybe anita went up because of zaza too?
[7:32:02] thegreatvan1lla: dexx isn’t the grower chat
[7:32:03] SunflowerJessie: Yes for all the hoppers they have tested it multiple times
[7:32:04] iHaruchi: So speedy selling doesn't matter for the company?
[7:32:04] nonimo777: doesn't make much sense...
[7:32:05] StorMN1: Are the hired seller worth the butc?
[7:32:06] ghostlikedevil: and then there’s also rep for the seller which is separate. very intricate system
[7:32:08] its_russo15: it still has tho?
[7:32:09] denn3ri: Is dexx still involved with the company_
[7:32:09] Repsie: @Repsie yeah after more updates and changes
[7:32:09] xTommyyz: @Ray__C does zaza sell for more then reggie? 󠀀
[7:32:12] jennyindisguise: An extra wall to stop people from walking into the stairwell wall could work as a workaround
[7:32:14] matchabread: didn't hydra steal zaza too?

[7:32:33] RiasGremoryLoveHer: dex Susge
[7:32:33] boublibou: KEKW
[7:32:33] czx_void: Zaza was also being sold in sandy initially?
[7:32:34] qrcd_vv: speak of the devil
[7:32:37] ThatMadeUWet: SUS DEX
[7:32:39] akazplays: why didnt company grab the rest of the zaza from him
[7:32:40] JTokez82: could be a combination of both ,
[7:32:40] AJaySaid: cool ... we kill dedx
[7:32:41] imansf2: str¨kc¨¨
[7:32:41] Micky_Good: 100%
[7:32:42] buyremdesivir: are you sure it aint lang buddah selling zaza he robbed from your sellers on cyprus
[7:32:42] nosebeersx: i mean its somewhat like IRL in a sense, you want your stuff to be popular in an area, if its sold somewhere else people would think its fake/shitty/etc @Ray__C
[7:32:42] nonimo777: stock
[7:32:42] enser27: why did dex flip? i missed it
[7:32:43] its_russo15: i think u are wrong, but i completley get the logic

[7:32:47] complexdepression: Supply
[7:32:47] baesona: o7 DEX
[7:32:48] MLGiShadow: stash
[7:32:49] toxic_smit: if the company 6 man push zaza on cypress the company will be 100 rep today
[7:32:49] magnetstrolldespair: ANITA better anyways
[7:32:50] RiasGremoryLoveHer: HUNT HIM DOWN MEGALUL
[7:32:50] jojo_s93: that actually makes sense
[7:32:51] zer0sake: why not just ask him?
[7:32:51] remati121: also stolen zaza
[7:32:53] AJaySaid: o7 dex
[7:32:54] shikenji_: Ahmmmmmm yep
[7:32:57] blazeinferno14: same thing potentially with Windsong
[7:32:59] zzzenchef: that bastard raycHmm
[7:33:00] lucysmacker69: HOW MUCH DID DEX STOLE WTF
[7:33:01] buyremdesivir: are you sure it aint lang buddah selling zaza he robbed from your sellers on cyprus??
[7:33:02] PolishGarnek: Buy it from him?
[7:33:03] xTommyyz: dexx Madge
[7:33:03] flexg_: Pretty fun storyline
[7:33:03] GAMANTAKA: @ButWhyLucas u missed the explanation. thats disproven theory
[7:33:04] ARANDOMSCOTT: who grows Zaza
[7:33:05] FictionK: When Zaza was at 58% you guys sold so many at Sandy and it went down like 20% tho
[7:33:06] akazplays: @buyremdesivir benji grabbed some zaza off luciano's body i think
[7:33:07] GBRnyc: he can’t grow zaza anymore?
[7:33:09] matchabread: was dexx 'the farmer'? or someone else?
[7:33:12] BrainDeadTheMain: @Ray__C didnt yall invest in that anyway so its urs to ask for
[7:33:13] nosebeersx: logically it makes complete sense
[7:33:14] xsgem01: He can make unlimited zaza he’s on the app
[7:33:16] ragekiiddd: what about your growers?
[7:33:16] toxic_smit: gotta kick windsong n dexx
[7:33:19] akazplays: windsong is still growing for company tho
[7:33:20] WuetendesWiesel: when did dexx get kicked out, and how
[7:33:20] sour0orange: @blazeinferno14 wtf she left after taking
[7:33:23] Lindun: Makes sense
[7:33:29] Knives85ss: does it go bad after time?
[7:33:29] christian_pr24: fr fr
[7:33:31] ButWhyLucas: @GAMANTAKA They sold zaza at sandy my man that what his saying right now
[7:33:33] optimalpickle: but sellers can be robbed
[7:33:33] Lindun: Any smuck can sell
[7:33:34] MrVale: EZ growers
[7:33:36] ahadbheda: what if it’s based on the amount of people selling in a turf, ex: 1 scooby seller vs 2 zaza sellers
[7:33:40] enser27: what happened with dex
[7:33:46] cubxumah: @ray__c it's not even called rep, it is NUMBER OF SALES(YOURS) / NUMBER OF SALES(BIGGEST SELLER) and biggest seller is baseline 100% and that's why anita jumped from 7 to 100 when it got separated from other turfs
[7:33:47] buyremdesivir: are you sure it aint lang buddah selling zaza he robbed from your sellers on cyprus
[7:33:47] ThatMadeUWet: As true in irl too lol
[7:33:47] azdabsttv: source always needs to be the most solid
[7:33:51] JSauce_0: JSauce_0 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months! 
[7:33:51] alpasoup1: So ming would've hurt the company
[7:33:51] RaycBot: Thank you @JSauce_0 for the 23 months of subs!
[7:33:52] kalesauce8: it could also be that once you start selling the rep goes down bc of the not selling period ya know? like the customers get angy when the product they want isn’t available no?
[7:33:54] setraaaa: did yall kick him from the app though
[7:33:55] CS2Salle: left the city?
[7:33:59] NicolaFred: that’s why Lang and co are miles ahead in the weed game
[7:34:00] iHaruchi: So speedy selling doesn't matter for the company? 󠀀
[7:34:00] samlecs: exactly zaza taken from the local sellers is very low amount even if speedy takes from them
[7:34:00] christian_pr24: PogU WAR
[7:34:01] oxo_unknown_oxo: pew pew PepegaGun
[7:34:01] nosebeersx: it makes sense from and IRL standpoint. if someone sells your shit somewhere else, they might think its fake/knockoff @Ray__C
[7:34:01] mojo6464: could it be possible that it’s less going now bc you guys are selling now more in cypress and
[7:34:02] crocsnsocksfr: left Kappa
[7:34:03] blazeinferno14: @sour0orange yeah but could have potentially made some zaza we don’t know of
[7:34:05] slolucid: @setraaaa yes
[7:34:05] qrcd_vv: so who's growing now ?
[7:34:06] fastrevo9: So when you had the Scooby Doo chip you could have bought seeds for theirs and screwed them? @Ray__C
[7:34:06] kaemezeta: @ahadbheda they just said they have more sellers and zaza is still going up
[7:34:07] sovaslava: maybe stupid question but how are the locations of each strain determined initially?
[7:34:07] Adrianetc: i mean realistcally you guys just wernt ready with sellers
[7:34:07] danishzombiex: what is it a 100 bags for 1% rep either way ?
[7:34:09] GBRnyc: that restricts your turf expansion from the get go like why would you be able to expand
[7:34:09] baesona: CG DEX
[7:34:10] Zorgc: he left LieMeter
[7:34:11] RiasGremoryLoveHer: who is the current grower feed him well LULW
[7:34:11] enser27: no key = leave
[7:34:12] buyremdesivir: @cubxumah yeah this seems true
[7:34:18] kalesauce8: @ggchatter2023 ah yeah yeah
[7:34:18] Nubbz1992: wait what happened with windsong
[7:34:19] viko_ziz: Dexx BLUBBERSWTF come home
[7:34:22] alpasoup1: The person who didn't want the NDA
[7:34:23] thegreatvan1lla: @qrcd_vv smalls benjis boy
[7:34:23] WuetendesWiesel: why did he leave? bc you didnt let him into the house?
[7:34:26] Raionx21: would make more sense that it went down while you were selling in sandy because they were selling in cypress pushing zaza down
[7:34:28] GAMANTAKA: @ButWhyLucas coulda been time based decay from product unavailibility.
[7:34:28] hapigilmore: Contact them
[7:34:45] danielle: wasn't wingsong growing anita
[7:34:49] xnairobiix: Do I remember correctly that tsunami is in about an hour?
[7:34:50] akazplays: windsong is on ANITA now i think
[7:34:57] brittbritt90d: the % are relative so selling someone else’s 100% strain won’t go down from 100%, yours Wii just go up relative to it
[7:34:58] enser27: @xnairobiix yee
[7:35:00] setraaaa: just find the unions growers
[7:35:01] ThatMadeUWet: Spin the block and get the zaza back
[7:35:02] dman547: @alsoglob
[7:35:04] PolishGarnek: SCHIZO LANG KIDNAPPED WINDSONG SCHIZO
[7:35:05] hapigilmore: Why not start over on strain
[7:35:08] reptilianares: this is y weed should be grown in the house itself
[7:35:12] zazmania: these theories lol
[7:35:15] ratirl_plays_variety_: O ta ta
[7:35:20] Phoenix_Nectar: why don`t you remove dexx from the contact list on the app
[7:35:20] kalesauce8: y’all need to clean up your app personnel then ASAP
[7:35:31] enser27: spin the block twice like their aint no where to park -21 21 21 21 21 21
[7:35:36] VoltKK_: but speedy is robing zaza too , he can lower the rep by selling zaza
[7:35:41] dman547: B)
[7:36:01] NicolaFred: well…. there’s your issue LUL LUL LUL
[7:36:06] wally1899: @VoltKK_ that was the agreement with speedy
[7:36:07] Aviii5: who grows for lang PepeLaugh
