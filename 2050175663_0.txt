[3:29:02] freakinfe3n: Street smart is what i meant
[3:29:25] SlashThePriest: The problem is getting into the server and actually building connections in rp, or building your streaming channel, when you can't sit and queue all day. If you already stream full-time it's easier to adapt to the queue
[3:29:50] freakinfe3n: Cause people can be smart but being street smart is not that easy to find Hmmge
