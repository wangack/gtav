[0:36:37] captaincameron: can you see it under the hood?
[0:36:45] illifis: Maybe it drives terribly... or people just feel like 100k is too much for a "meh" car
[0:36:51] L4zyb4ssturd: Maybe there aren't classes anymore. The car is just what the car is
[0:36:53] matt7x7x: there is a meta car

[0:42:28] Archangelos1: ye
[0:42:42] Reiv_: tbh it feels like this version of NP lost role, and only keep play. all this everyone can be anyone, no WLs made it too rusty
[0:42:51] Archangelos1: its not fomo when you actually have to grind to move forward KEKW
[0:42:53] Nohbob: Like another job.
[0:42:55] mossad321: whats the point anymore
[0:42:57] miicrowv: Become Greg

[0:43:42] shpuddie: its almost double downed on gangs being self sufficient
[0:43:45] Isen_Mage: whitelists were never the problem, bad management of them was
[0:43:50] Archangelos1: WL were fine. People gaslit themselves that WLs were a problem.
[0:44:11] FriskiestSpoon: if you can do everything within your own group why bother going outside of it
[0:44:17] ducknoodles: WLs are fine if people can lose them
[0:44:29] catlasskass: I agree. It seems a lot like a mainstream MMO these days, everyone's just grinding
[0:44:33] Archangelos1: There was a minor bad management of WL that gave such a bad name to them.
[0:44:34] Reiv_: ye imo WLs are important, even further more, WLs help setup top layer of the city, that creates middle layer by providing stuff, and move to bottom layer. it creates different roles, and its good.
[0:44:36] HotCocoaGamer: Yeah i miss actual hiring rp. Folks can just show up now.
[0:44:45] zenatr: Problem with WLs is that you can cut people off completely, even if you're not meant too
[0:45:02] rmcgowan: The thing I am seeing is the systems seem like they were designed with the idea that people can't do everything so they will interact more with people, but the end result has been larger groups are forming that get people so the group can do everything
[0:45:04] Soov: i think if they change how job reps work in the near future it'd be a good change, like properly locking in jobs
[0:45:22] eborcurean: they blacklisted loads of people
[0:45:26] Fr0stwav3: not everything needs to be WL'd and not everything needs to be free market KEKW

[0:45:41] Soov: @Fr0stwav3 pretty much this yea
[0:45:44] eborcurean: let roleplay affect things
[0:46:12] Devaleth: or have WL's on separate characters, not their "Main" characters

[0:48:22] RatBrick: I mean you've heald out for a very long time
[0:48:36] Devaleth: true, but you've still tried to keep it open. the Lang deals, NotHydra
[0:48:45] Vatinius: mats had no WLs in 3.0 either tbf, until Sionis at least, 'cause there were less benches/less consumption
[0:49:06] prozorftw: true
[0:49:07] shpuddie: nodd
[0:49:16] zaps6666: if u have a group of like 40 u dont need to talk to ppl cus u can have everything in 1 group
[0:49:37] zippybln2: if you have a group of 40 ppl, you have 40 ppl which talk to each other DankReading
[0:49:42] Devaleth: and also it's not like a large criminial organisation (like the one you are trying to RP) would have their fingers in all sorts of pies
[0:49:44] comfycathie: RP with Lang is very good always
[0:49:46] shpuddie: kinda cool to see the actual stronarming and cornering of a market that can happen nodd

[0:50:53] zenatr: One problem with WL for me is that if you have one, it's kinda impossible to 'fail', which can make it boring to watch
[0:51:04] shpuddie: at least this car can actually go the speedlimit KEKW
[0:51:09] Devaleth: depends how you RP it
[0:51:28] Reiv_: imo WLs just should have dedicated characters... like PM is a perfect example of WL holder
[0:51:31] RandomDCLXVI: COPIUM engine replacements soon.
[0:51:38] Meh17_: WL should be removed if you fuck it up. They wouldn't be a problem with them if its like that
[0:51:48] rmcgowan: I just am hoping we will see a system where groups are encouraged to specialize like individual characters are
[0:51:53] Meh17_: there Pepega
[0:51:56] RatBrick: yeah look at whippy...
[0:51:58] Reiv_: then that WL holder deals with actual low key player groups, and low key groups spread stuff

[1:59:21] KingKova: @kyliebitkin This have a turbo in it?
[1:59:26] Sahneee: 99 mm
[1:59:27] BlightSpeaker26: That explains why Hazel has an automatic

[2:00:34] illifis: Manual just aint it for racing
[2:00:37] Marshall2: o7
[2:00:39] TheWhiteWillow94: manual looks impossible
[2:00:39] FriskiestSpoon: it seems like the guy who did the cars has some crazy physics in it if it is simulating the car being unloaded when you clutch in
[2:00:39] mugcostanza: kyliebList
[2:00:41] awe_rora: o7 manual is gonna take some getting used to

[2:00:49] Archangelos1: Yeah manuals for racing is so bad KEKW
[2:00:51] FIunkifer: yeah the car looks so slippery with manual in those turns
[2:00:57] TheWhiteWillow94: @gridy_faker its already on high
[2:01:08] ralfyrich99: lessons learned nodd
[2:01:08] prozorftw: It looks brutal from our pov too
[2:01:09] NitroC3LL: kylieNODDERS it was looking so tough, even trying to imagine how to do it without a racing wheel boggles my mind
[2:01:14] stylzo_: So manuel is Not it, you get thrown Off soooo far Off Line that also cost so much speed
[2:01:18] EyeScraem: neutren thinks it might be a bug
[2:01:22] dannyrebman: At least now you know
[2:01:33] ch4mm_: it stepped out every other corner a lil bit nodd
[2:01:34] bwehn: how precise do you need to be with revs for shifting?
[2:01:38] RandomDCLXVI: does your keyboard have the 3 buttons max limit Kylie?

[2:02:12] suhva: oh god kyliebLul
[2:02:12] doccthunder: KEKW you need like 4 hands
[2:02:14] zippybln2: OMEGALAUGHING

[2:02:20] Lorddarkwolf: ur strength is also being able to see what is around the corner and u werent able to do that
[2:02:21] Archangelos1: fight the car in every shift
[2:02:22] comfycathie: Wicked
[2:02:24] ch4mm_: ok that was kinda sick by hazel
[2:02:26] candancejade: OMEGADANCE
[2:02:30] FriskiestSpoon: in a racing sim game that would be cool, but don't know about GTA
[2:02:31] bwehn: yeah you need extra hand for that
[2:02:34] Meh17_: sequential seems ok but manual is straight up impossible
[2:02:35] ThePitfallover: automatic has it's quirks like not upshifting into the highest gear despite feeling like it has the speed, sequential really seems like the best of both worlds
[2:02:42] captaincameron: yeah just grow more hands
[2:02:50] Matrix8369: does hazels car have a smaller turbo?
[2:02:57] eborcurean: some cars seem awful with automatics but his seems v good with it
[2:03:01] TheWhiteWillow94: hypothetically if it was sequential and you could rebind the shifting to your mouse buttons do you think it would feel better? tink
[2:03:10] illifis: I have a feeling that preference to automatic or sequential will depend on the car and it's gearing
[2:03:50] rmcgowan: Hey, at least you know a lot more about how the various transmissions impact the way a car drives
[2:04:05] mugcostanza: kyliebList
[2:04:31] RatBrick: better the R+D was done now then during a getaway
[2:05:52] mugcostanza: kyliebMwiggle

[2:06:41] Delaser: Sup dweebs
[2:06:41] Sahneee: for casual driving I guess
[2:06:41] klugklug: when did automatic become so good?
[2:06:43] ThePitfallover: it's like choosing a difficulty setting
[2:06:45] FriskiestSpoon: uniquely awful to experience
[2:06:45] bwehn: in racing yeah im just saying in general
[2:06:53] gridy_faker: but i heard octo preferws manuals
[2:06:55] ThePitfallover: they're quirky for just casual driving
[2:07:04] Hudyn: if one is better everyone will just use the best one

[2:07:44] TheWhiteWillow94: Susge
[2:08:03] TheWhiteWillow94: HUH automatic drifting??
[2:08:39] CaptainVector86: You should be able to clutch kick a manual to drift tbh...
[2:08:55] captaincameron: and automatic is good for not getting boxed because reverse is easy
[2:09:10] LayndShark: that might be why it looked like he was letting you pass him
[2:09:25] bwehn: i hope some advanced tuning comes soon NODDERS shit will be dope
