[0:45:11] Delnoir: I feel like a lot of cop players still have psychic wounds from being punching bags on NoPixel.
[0:45:15] Delnoir: It was BAD at the end.
[0:45:16] Salimufari: Can'
[0:45:18] Salimufari: can

[0:46:37] KyoKaito: A few cops come to mind...
[0:46:57] OnlyVaL: damn this truck gets moving quick
[0:47:07] CandL2023: Classic deer
[0:47:08] thestarsaredown: youre not wrong, but this also feels very reactionary to some people just constantly wildin out too, like getting processed four and five times a night for violent stuff
[0:47:11] ridd_762mm: rooMadSlam
[0:47:14] mikasa88: kill it

[0:47:38] mikasa88: she going run over deer
[0:47:43] Warstratigier: getting a Me, Myself, and Momo situation...
[0:47:44] Rise0fTheNerds: While fair it needs balance, the crim side easily rubberbands, while the cop side often doesn't build back up after it drops. It easily gets unbalanced tbf.
[0:47:44] roguegunslinger1: A job well done.
[0:47:45] SunDevil56: thats one way to do it
[0:47:45] ridd_762mm: MomoClap

[0:47:55] Flamquill: Deer moved
[0:47:56] roguegunslinger1: saved a deers life today
[0:47:58] KingCanadaHill: adoreClap adoreTailW
[0:48:35] Rise0fTheNerds: Rough crim often builds back up and sustains, while cop drops and doesn't build back up unless it's the popular cop time.

[0:48:59] Grothmar9: Lol
[0:49:11] RealKingLear: There's already not a lot to get into from the crim side and it hasn't been very rewarding.
[0:49:24] Pirithous1: room to breath
[0:49:28] Grothmar9: Phrasing?
[0:49:28] Salimufari: That'
[0:49:28] CollectorRaven: "Compact"
[0:49:30] ridd_762mm: lol
[0:49:33] KingCanadaHill: Free to do the gang stuff

[0:49:40] wheres_my_mojo: adoreFG adoreFG
[0:49:40] DirtorBust: lol
[0:50:10] Rise0fTheNerds: Crim should be rough bc once they get on top it often doesn't topple easily/quickly. Young server though so we'll see.
[0:50:17] Grothmar9: @Maxwell_Bronson,  Brother man take a breath
[0:50:22] roguegunslinger1: that's going to be tricky to broach in rp without coming off soft on crime.
[0:50:23] Grothmar9: Just chill
[0:50:29] Maxwell_Bronson: @Grothmar9 no u
[0:50:31] germendetrigo: Hello Momo and company adoreLove MomoLove
[0:50:40] andrewng34: KonCha KonCha
[0:50:52] KingCanadaHill: Clarence!!!!!
[0:50:56] Rise0fTheNerds: 24 hours cooldown or more?
[0:50:56] Sizz1eBacon: GangRp is a delicate balance for sure
[0:51:10] Grothmar9: True
[0:51:14] Grothmar9: A good idea
[0:51:14] ariasonatas: a black market dealer
[0:51:16] omen_nevermore: back alley arms dealer
[0:51:23] CollectorRaven: Saturday Night Special
[0:51:25] ridd_762mm: Illegal gun ?
[0:51:26] MrRager_24: 3d printing guns were in the trailer no?
[0:51:31] Regzen: D-val's deals wolfaGiggle
[0:51:31] dirtEmartinE: @TampaTeeJay thanks for the sub; you are so very generous :)
[0:51:34] Rise0fTheNerds: There will be one. Always is one eventually. Often goes wild when it does.
[0:51:38] mikasa88: we need john wick
[0:51:38] Grothmar9: @ridd_762mm I feel like it would pass for legal
[0:52:01] Grothmar9: @ridd_762mm Like a workaround to get black market RP
[0:52:03] RealKingLear: Mats are crazy hard to come by also
[0:52:12] tripl3fastx: LUL
[0:52:13] KingCanadaHill: adoreHehe
[0:52:16] ridd_762mm: lol 👍
[0:52:19] lokiiidokii: Could have a blackmarketeer as a role to sell the guns...
[0:52:23] ariasonatas: haha would be cool for D'val... back alley shop that sells ecclectic stuff, but if you say the right words, there's more for sale
[0:52:26] Sizz1eBacon: It'd be neat if the the black market rotated locations every week so ppl didn't catch them with the rumors.
[0:52:29] Grothmar9: @lokiiidokii Yeahhhhhhh
[0:52:52] Grothmar9: Course how would the black market get guns? hmmmmmm
[0:53:07] Grothmar9: Is it a player or an NPC?
[0:53:49] KingCanadaHill: adoreList adoreTailW
[0:53:50] lokiiidokii: Prolly player, just give them an easier cooldown? Mayb cheaper prices to make money
[0:54:10] ariasonatas: wait, what about a boat
[0:54:25] ariasonatas: someone sells the blackmarter stuff via ship
[0:54:42] AltBlu: ??? 3d printing isnt that espensive, you can get a good printer for 700$ get a dimondback nosel then spend 200$ in highend fiberglass filiment you can print out that one time use 3 barrel pistol that works up to 9mm and with 200$ you can print out 2-3 of those guns
[0:54:47] nonsmellaoverlord: @TampaTeeJay Thanks for the gift sub!
[0:54:54] Grothmar9: @lokiiidokii adoreList  Not a bad idea
[0:54:55] Sizz1eBacon: Yea you don't want them just gang banging in the streets, but also don't want to squash it to such an extent that it just doesn't happen anymore.
[0:55:27] ridd_762mm: NODDERS
[0:55:32] Delnoir: Constructive Possession.
[0:55:52] CandL2023: So he clearly climbed the prison tower and shot them across the city
[0:55:53] imSammers: but they had it?
[0:55:57] ridd_762mm: corruption in the force?
[0:56:00] roguegunslinger1: Sounds like it should come out in court. Did the officer know ti at the time?
[0:56:01] RealKingLear: Yeah... that's a cheap W
[0:56:04] Rise0fTheNerds: Then they shouldn't buy hot guns lol
[0:56:13] omen_nevermore: stripHmm
[0:56:17] LeaZhee: i think you can use an affirmative defense to get out of hot gun charges, like this
[0:56:19] DirtorBust: aozora1D the system is broken
[0:56:19] imSammers: That just sounds like he fucked up then
[0:56:35] Delnoir: This wouldn't happen to have been Wrangler's bust last night?
[0:56:40] ridd_762mm: NODDERS
[0:56:40] Nightwolf_mkii: Would that not come up in the bench trial?
[0:56:40] Rise0fTheNerds: Oh yeah, def sounds like they should have investigated. That has been lacking
[0:56:50] KingCanadaHill: CoolStoryBob  **nods in agreement**
[0:56:54] Sizz1eBacon: Yea that's the kind of shit Judges should be picking apart.
[0:56:58] RealKingLear: It's kind of lazy RP imo
[0:57:01] Sizz1eBacon: And laying out.
[0:57:02] PhosPhryne: The ballas have been getting fucked hard.
[0:57:04] germendetrigo: PetTheMomo
[0:57:04] imSammers: i mean, if he didn't answer any questions about it, then he should get the charges
[0:57:06] andrewng34: huh
[0:57:12] roguegunslinger1: Did the cop know the crim had an Alibi?
[0:57:12] ariasonatas: that's what Jack was trying to do.. start deeper investigation
[0:57:25] Rise0fTheNerds: @Nightwolf_mkii Also fair, they could do benchtrial assuming it was available
[0:57:25] Delnoir: It sounds like something that needs to be appealed with prison records.
[0:57:48] imSammers: yeah because rp should be the main focus - not the charges
[0:57:53] Sizz1eBacon: PepeLaugh Ford driver pov
[0:58:04] KingCanadaHill: BibleThump no hit truck
[0:58:04] RealKingLear: But even then you would only really charge them with obstruction of justice or accomplice, right?
[0:58:09] DirtorBust: D:
[0:58:20] MrRager_24: they didn’t ask for a bench trial?
[0:58:28] SilverShakez: SilverShakez subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:58:59] SilverShakez: The guy that plays Max stopping by to show some love ❤️
[0:59:05] RealKingLear: That seems like it'd be an easy W in court.
[0:59:11] RoninJawn: The last time I saw that happen, there were no judges awake for a bench trial.
[0:59:14] imSammers: i would charge them for the crime if they didnt fess up to why they possessed the weapon, but accomplice would be the better charge for court
[0:59:18] Delnoir: Wouldn't covering the crime up after the fact be Accessory?
[0:59:18] Salimufari: sounds like poor or lazy rp to charge that.
[0:59:20] RealKingLear: But with how jammed the courts are it's just adding more strain there.
[0:59:39] E_S_P_O: you could also charge the criminal with sale of gun if they don't offer any info on where they got the gun
[1:00:02] imSammers: Sounds like the DA should step in
[1:00:07] roguegunslinger1: @Salimufari Cop might not know any of that though.
