[0:27:49] AWildChocobo: There is a soft cap, but it's infinite otherwise
[0:27:51] articpuffin: Path of exile 2 looks so good if you havent seen it
[0:27:53] nasirum: wouldnt call it a complete game
[0:28:07] glazedscronut: There's a story?
[0:28:12] DoingBusiness: dude try poe
[0:28:22] wildfathom: last epoch got classes right, the story isnt really a story. its a fun game though
[0:28:31] D4rkkkk_: d3 with mcconnel kyleisHYPERS
[0:28:32] AWildChocobo: I love PoE, I've got thousands of hours, but I hope they make poe2 more accessible for new players KEKW
[0:28:34] Optimus_Mega: Lots of hours to play. Easily sink in 100 Hours.
[0:28:37] articpuffin: your a streamer you can get free stuff
[0:28:48] blanco_570: the monoliths and the infinitely scaling corruption in them is a fun endgame mechanic to see how high you can get
[0:28:54] DoingBusiness: if i can play poe anyone can
[0:28:57] Slesh5: yeah last epoch has a better approach -they have skill trees for each skill rather than one huge tree
[0:29:02] articpuffin: I have 15k hrs in PoE
[0:29:07] VinnieBagaDonuts: i have about 800 hours in poe and i still have no idea what im doing half the time. but i loved it though
[0:29:32] TheCrimsonNite: Not in d4 because it's dogshit
[0:29:39] wildfathom: i like POE and i still wouldnt recommend it to anyone lol

[0:30:04] cyberoptix_hs: and then you get another one when you get to endgame
[0:30:06] asdgfhjklqwer: @Suboptimal ?????\
[0:30:16] Optimus_Mega: It feels good when you make good choices for your character's skills and stats. Immediate feedback by wiping enemies out faster NODDERS
[0:30:17] tarantaika83: why not use one of the forum builds
[0:30:18] Darkpaolo: last epoch is the best middle ground
[0:30:22] wildfathom: the worst part of POE, is you get that big ass tree sorted out, then an update changes 2 skills and fucks the entire thing up
[0:30:23] Ryponino: @Optimus_Mega WAVE
[0:30:23] articpuffin: its just big after 1k hrs in PoE you still wont know KEKW
[0:30:34] AWildChocobo: and on top of that you have ascendancy classes and pantheons KEKW
[0:30:35] xrotted: its not that bad once you make some builds, you just memorize where what node is eventually
[0:30:36] asdgfhjklqwer: I just follow builds lol
