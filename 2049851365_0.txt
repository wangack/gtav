[4:51:44] haleybrielle: would make sense if zaza + scooby = 100. but if each can get to 100 i don't see how either affects each other. maybe im wrong though
[4:51:45] mottarro: thats worse then before bruh lmao wanst it 14 a bag before 100 rep?
[4:51:48] EndurenPlays: scooby dooby is basically 100%+ the % number they are below 100%. as soon as you both reach 100 and they push on you go down to 99 i think

[4:52:18] ophyce: MY THEORY IS THE CITY NEED ALL THE TURF TO BE TO 100 % TO GET THE ROBERIES ON THE APP
[4:52:20] WeeeeD: more likely that scooby is more than 100% that is why it is not going down
[4:52:21] nphect_: u are probaly at 200% + if that is the case LULW
[4:52:22] Tensetechnician: customer didn't pay for the weed? Go beat that customer up!

[5:15:07] drgoods: harry doesnt keep the dirty money
[5:15:07] Hoxter: Honestly but what if the money you make for the group is counted with the weekly dues for everyone? So he can work his way out of the debt this way? This could work for everyone  @SayeedBlack

[5:15:26] daniel2keer: everybody a snake exept speedy
[5:15:26] THRASHworld3: i thought it was crime money is for group and clean money is personal money
[5:15:28] tommy_booyyy: I thought they were saying if you don't contribute to the group fund then you won't get a payout
[5:15:29] Wo7lf1: Good Awareness Sayeed
[5:15:31] JMaker24: nah Harry has already contributed. Tony is behind in contribution
[5:15:32] nahoopii: Harry's legit

[5:15:43] dhiabenmansour: does he ??????? he put it in the safe , yuno 2 selling pces he put it to the group
[5:15:43] beanblood69: should be crime for group and legal for themselves. easiest way. but yeah donna meetings are always fun haha
[5:15:44] lewisborlase: @finsane1 he buys the mats though
[5:15:45] techy_krypton: I think for you it should be señor buns money for yourself then right?
[5:15:46] baesic3: locals are built different LUL
[5:15:46] Cocotaso1: I just think Tony is a little behind from vacations. he will be fine in a few weeks when he catches up.

[5:16:03] laks86: It makes sense what Tony want to do but Lang will lose his mind 100% 😅
[5:16:04] devthebasedgod: how’s the rep battle going on the strain?
[5:16:05] ChrisPNutssss: @beanblood69 yeah thats how its supposed to be
[5:16:08] Wiidiis: weed is not a group effort really, you need one grower and seller, the grower also spends 1/10th the time a seller does
[5:16:09] ty_136: i love john and stevie
[5:16:10] Xernique: @Ohkayei still it would be fair that like 30% of civ job earning went to group
[5:16:13] midwest_dad: @cocotaso1 that is copium of the year
[5:16:13] baesic3: THATS GOOD LUL

[5:16:28] ty_136: @Rafayv stolen
[5:16:34] noize: how is stevie selling?
[5:16:37] Wo7lf1: I think 3 growers is more than enough tbh @SayeedBlack
[5:16:37] bluoxxboi: How many pushers you guys going to have
[5:16:40] ddpbr: and got caught o7
[5:16:40] TropicalToucan: Lowkey him trying to play 3 characters is going to burn him out
[5:16:41] hollywudsmkn_hogan: @wiidiis in rp and this system it is the more pushers the better
[5:16:42] kSwong9: Now that I think about it. Shouldn't the money you make go to you. Then you pay your dues to the group?
[5:16:43] ChrisPNutssss: poor si
[5:16:45] Rafayv: @ty_136 he should purchase one when they are availbe.
[5:16:46] Wo7lf1: Yeah
[5:16:49] LeDerpington: @style959 but Si has been going after the company
[5:16:49] Wo7lf1: 100%
[5:16:55] redemption2094: Si with the slow burn rp
[5:16:55] baesic3: true
[5:16:56] pqm11: yep
[5:16:57] Wo7lf1: YE
[5:16:59] jaysuay3: Tony just doesn't want to keep a steady job.
[5:16:59] ChrisPNutssss: si is not built for pushing he more like an enforcer
[5:16:59] theSlinkyy: do you guys have more growers now∑
[5:17:00] Miffmac: agreed
[5:17:01] baesic3: yes u are right
[5:17:03] itskvn__: @TropicalToucan Who is?
[5:17:03] jayrm6: 100%
[5:17:04] GreenMan_: @kSwong9 youd think
[5:17:05] Wo7lf1: 1000%
[5:17:08] noize: true, dougie needs to ramp up now then
[5:17:10] 11_Brad_11: You have enough supply, don't need more growers
[5:17:14] Bourry71: and if its not a thug war for the weed ?
[5:17:18] vosje91: @kSwong9 but tony has debt
[5:17:18] ty_136: @Rafayv hes sellin drugs, his bike is just gonna get flagged by pd lol
[5:17:22] Piyushroongta24: He does not understand the kickback thing i guess buddhaH buddhaH buddhaH buddhaH buddhaH buddhaH buddhaH buddhaH buddhaH buddhaH buddhaH
[5:17:22] Brodoswagings: hows the rep now?
[5:17:22] Wo7lf1: Yeah EZ
[5:17:25] Ohkayei: @xernique hows that fair? group brings nothing to their civ jobs
[5:17:28] zodlez: YEP a specialized workforce is more efficient
[5:17:33] searlesbarkleyk: Maybe a % of the crime money should go right back to the person and than decrease the weekly payouts?
[5:17:37] Wiidiis: they don’t put in anywhere near the time you do though speedy, 3 of them is like one of you
[5:17:37] style959: @LeDerpington yee i know he also mentioned hes not really enjoying pushing-RP. because youre on your own the whole time
[5:17:37] TropicalToucan: @itskvn__ Anthonyz plays Tony, his son aj, and now copleone
[5:17:47] ChrisPNutssss: with harry, teddy and dougie the growing should be fine
[5:17:56] dawgh: @kSwong9 they're in the building phase rn they need to work togheter to progress
[5:17:58] LeDerpington: @style959 yeah that’s true
[5:18:28] itskvn__: @TropicalToucan I mean, that's his choice though. If he wants to be a Don he needs to be involved. Otherwise he should just be a member.
[5:18:36] twitchchatter07: YAAAEEE
[5:18:41] AdLib_24: KEKW
[5:18:44] Wo7lf1: KEKW
[5:18:48] GILLETTEBESTAMANCANGET: why is lang not putting mats money in by the same logic
[5:18:49] ChrisPNutssss: @itskvn__ true
[5:18:49] mj_bruhh: there should be 50/50 split for the group and the people bringing money
[5:18:53] Zoraxx51: I'm sorry but tony doesn't get the big picture
[5:18:56] Bourry71: the war wasnt about the turf kek
[5:18:59] hollywudsmkn_hogan: @itskvn__ now Tony deserves to be a don
[5:19:01] Wiidiis: they started the war over a lot more then the turf
[5:19:04] SmoothCriminal0110: wasn’t over turf lmao it was over undercutting prices
[5:19:08] ChrisPNutssss: @GILLETTEBESTAMANCANGET legal job vs crime money, not the same
[5:19:24] AdLib_24: crowbar and chopping tool were bought with group money, so there needs to be return on that investment for the group
[5:19:30] searlesbarkleyk: More fun with turf competition
[5:19:43] tommyroberto: @Zoraxx51 Tony is in 40k of debt and wants to do crime to make money to pay it - i don't really disagree with what he's saying
[5:19:49] baesic3: lets be honest the company wanted any reason they can find to start a war LUL  so it could be over anything
[5:19:49] ophyce: There is no point of having personnal money when you are part of a group . Just put it all together in one pile and vote on what is needed and what is not
[5:19:50] itskvn__: @hollywudsmkn_hogan I totally agree, but it is not fair to guys that are putting all their time and effort and are just low on the ranks.
[5:19:55] bStrukt: @wiidiis your right, Lang hung up on Ray LUL
[5:19:58] Babushka_82: CHAAAAAAAAT !discord

[5:20:12] SmoothCriminal0110: @baesic3 wrong
[5:20:15] searlesbarkleyk: @adlib_24 lol the chopping tool was group too? Man Tony-20k gonna get reamed
[5:20:17] djerbis: @searlesbarkleyk the problem is that all contribute untill it becomes cash to use. imo gege should deal with this and make like payments accoring to jobs and stuff, but that also maybe too much to ask, anyway its good for rp to have problems
[5:20:19] itskvn__: @tommyroberto Crime doesn't make a lot of money yet though.
[5:20:20] hollywudsmkn_hogan: @itskvn__ bro it's rp it's not that serious
[5:20:21] dhiabenmansour: @ophyce thats dumb , some one like tonny will just chill on their back
[5:20:22] ChrisPNutssss: @ophyce legal vs illegal money, all illegal money is pooled i think

[6:44:58] cellojakers: what’s companies percent at

[6:45:52] smoktrees489: @nphect_ SeemsGood
[6:45:57] bird24287: you could also be at like 130 rep and they pull you down to 115 but you don’t know yet
[6:46:00] nate921269: wonder if it’s like the old boost once u got so far over 100 even if u lost a boost didn’t go down cause was way over 100 just only showed up to 100
[6:46:01] 11_Brad_11: @BlueShift_IV yeah probably just not showing
[6:46:05] Babushka_82: @antrff 100
[6:46:17] DaddyJJ917: it’s good to test and find out though and kick them out if you’re right I think
[6:46:22] avb5545: I think you may have pushed past 100 but it only displays up to 100. So they may have brought you down but not under 100

[7:06:11] watermelontoboggan: @reach27 because they are at 100
[7:06:20] smoktrees489: make them leave then go to sandy and make them leave there too
[7:06:22] tofuhai: but why arent we going down ever

[7:06:30] djerbis: also with the 100 rep you tank then even if 1 v1 cuz of the rep buff
[7:06:31] Axy_p: yup
[7:06:34] st0rmblessed__: @SayeedBlack why are u suddenly allowing them to sell at your turf
[7:06:35] reach27: unless there is a buffer above 100?
[7:06:37] juancarlos929: ohhhh
[7:06:42] CorysAlternative: ahhhh
[7:06:44] LucasRadouch: but we don't know if it goes down if you sell Zaza somewhere else
[7:06:46] Teddsan: drop their shit
[7:06:48] AsianStyle86: could be u are above 100% like 150%
[7:06:49] DeafxKid: i wanna say reason why LUL:
[7:06:50] Pritz247: it's like max 160% so it's a tug of war
[7:06:51] nixi992: Last night Benji was excited he pushed 1% then Lang and Luciano knocked them down by 1% after 1 sale LUL
[7:06:51] OhGyMod: Plus a buffer?
[7:06:51] jesscdcc: makes sense for the devs to do that
[7:06:59] SKIZOWwww: either that or scooby has buffer
[7:07:01] beached__: @AsianStyle86 thats what i was thinking too
[7:07:02] aniquilattion: they also have another turf
[7:07:05] decaffgluten: can you imagine if there is a max for rep in a turf like 199% :tf: that way only 1 can be 100 and others think they also can get there
[7:07:07] lolSMCballs: their rep dropped tho how
[7:07:11] avaiano2: true should be
[7:07:12] Razorbl00d: Scooby is prolly in a "hidden" 150% in my opinion
[7:07:14] iLLuSi0NN: Or you are over 100% but its not showing
[7:07:15] Ex0ticAnimal: What was previously?
[7:07:18] AsianStyle86: it's probably coded so u can go over 100% but it only shows 100%
[7:07:19] peeeeeeeeeejj: make sense
[7:07:21] CorysAlternative: Non Disclosure Kush LUL
[7:07:22] scarthy: pushing it back down to 27 would be so demoralising to them KEKW
[7:07:23] kellbean: maybe there's a cap of 150%
[7:07:25] kirtinos: give them a call
[7:07:29] Babushka_82: @st0rmblessed__  it was Awkward cus end without any deal or whatever they cal;ll it
[7:07:29] da5id_h: need an NDA
[7:07:29] ty_136: @lolSMCballs they probably dont have anyone selling
[7:07:30] ANOMOlos: how much did they drop?
[7:07:32] kapsyllen: if you keep selling they never make it to 100
[7:07:33] LucasRadouch: could also be dropping because they're selling it somewhere else
[7:07:34] redemption2094: @decaffgluten he just explained
[7:07:35] nphect_: NDA that shit
[7:07:35] lolSMCballs: @yespixelenthusiast aah i thought kj were still doing it
[7:07:36] reach27: it could be that if they stop selling it decays
[7:07:37] ty_136: @ANOMOlos 1%
[7:07:37] Foxxera_tv: They will push it down more later for sure
[7:07:41] Bourry71: what about they didnt sell for too long ?
[7:07:45] unIuko: but it dropped and that what counts
[7:07:46] dootadoo: Clap
[7:07:48] zazmania: it proves tug of war
[7:07:48] st0rmblessed__: @Babushka_82 aaaah okay thanks for clarifying
[7:07:49] derpysmurf123: or they’re selling in sandy
[7:07:50] iSaLou__: maybe turf system is not complete yet by devs ?
[7:07:52] virol0ne: They went up like 10% since last night tho
[7:07:52] Timemod: 2%, they were at 38
[7:07:53] djerbis: your 100 rep also makes you win against 1 other seller that has less rep than you
[7:07:54] difficultsleep3r: The putos were warned about this.
[7:07:54] decaffgluten: @redemption2094 he just explained his assumption my man, only devs know how it works 100%
[7:08:00] da5id_h: first to 100 gets better leverage
[7:08:01] its507eric: you need a couple more sellers
[7:08:02] dhiabenmansour: if buddha gets on u guys will fuk their shit up
[7:08:04] ms_inez1: do these sellers sometimes snitch on u?
[7:08:06] DatMexicanOG: 1 percent is a lot for them.
[7:08:07] mrmattic1: Why would they tank their rep again lol
[7:08:09] ty_136: i think its a waste of their time your crew seems to have wayy more sellers
[7:08:09] kingbeerx: 2% they were at 38
[7:08:10] CorysAlternative: lol
[7:08:11] WHammer0209: it’s not a switch
[7:08:14] Teddsan: bro they gonna be delusional
[7:08:16] WHammer0209: they already there
[7:08:17] avaiano2: they making both products
[7:08:17] NEON_22: its decay only the growers are selling zaza to other people and its pushing it down globaly nothing to do with u selling here or not
[7:08:19] scarthy: Surely Sandy would be easier to push though?

[7:08:39] iLLuSi0NN: Its cumpany
[7:08:39] SpideyPB: It also seems like you can tell when they are not selling because you are making $14.33 a bag now. When they were selling you were only making $12
[7:08:42] saliromeo: just let them suffer LUL LUL
[7:08:43] civlaz: LULW

[7:08:58] thekenjam1: its seems like there a cancer people here spoling everything

[7:10:32] rttSKAR: u can sell, but theres has to be, or there will be, a benefit to 100% the turf. Otherwise, why bother. just sell anywhere
[7:10:33] Foxxera_tv: Next storm maybe you get something new maybe
[7:10:36] Fort3: Because they may not want to try to compete with Speedy for selling
[7:10:37] marc_dagreat: they should just cut their losses and dive fully into sandy because at this rate the won’t reach 100 on any turf
[7:10:38] mrmattic1: Theres constantly things unlocked so yep
