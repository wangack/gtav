[10:03:10] mechabananas: funny thing is you dont want head shots in RL hunting KEKW
[10:03:22] PIayinItSafe: @mechabananas this

[10:03:43] TyGuySlays: @mechabananas yeah you do...unless you trying to mount
[10:03:50] x_____________________d: just shoot the head 4Head
[10:03:52] DanLGG: yeah headshot theory doesn’t really make sense but this is gta rp so it’s possible
[10:04:01] chromebright: Does it matter that its a buck? The 2 that didnt let you skin were does.
[10:04:06] PrimeSlime__: if still doesn't work maybe try aiming on the heart? like the game the hunter call of the wild
[10:04:15] TorrentzX: @chromebright THIS
[10:04:27] madsol_: the reason you dont headshot deer irl is its a small target, hitting the hear/lungs is more reliable
[10:04:36] madsol_: heart*
[10:04:40] TyGuySlays: @madsol_ i mean if you suck sure
[10:05:03] limpingmonke: Will it let you 2man contract solo
[10:05:09] chromebright: Even the contracts show antlers. I think you have to shoot a buck with antlers.
[10:05:22] mrdumpling420: @madsol_ who doesn't know that captain obvious lol
[10:05:23] madsol_: PepegaGun i saw the deer and started blasting

[10:06:20] TyGuySlays: @mechabananas i mean you must  know a lot of bad shots lol. been deer hunting all my life. unless you using a bow or trying to mount...head shot means no finding it. easy
[10:06:28] imarinate: FunnyUp
[10:06:44] DanLGG: I’m going to bed but not because you told me to
[10:07:03] DanLGG: just so we’re clear lol
