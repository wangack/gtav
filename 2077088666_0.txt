[1:25:44] Hey_its_Mady: Do you while delivering moonshine you place the coins with bottles to get extra rolls?
[1:26:56] Torrok: or maybe having the coin on you will give you extra chance to get the 50% bonus
[1:27:36] Gangstajoka: salvage  the coin copper is lots of money

[1:47:20] RegulatorTTV: I thought Ramee mentioned a fuel injection blue print but I didn‚Äôt get any confirmation.
[1:47:42] Kkaedal: They only got money from the job

[1:49:14] d4ndyking: The loss is so bad that even progress isn't worth it. If you do it five times you are already at a 2.5 mil loss. Making that back is going to take fore ever.
[1:49:22] New_York_E: do you run your moonshine or not worth?
[1:49:30] RegulatorTTV: going to get saucy in the sewer soon I bet. I think the sewer is the key to money in the city

[2:15:41] Kkaedal: Guys Dickhead and 4head are 2 different people
[2:15:52] n1_majorlavon_: most on duty are the same old cops KEKWlaugh
[2:16:04] 88eg: you're about to be the gang ammo supplier with the only clean record at this rate lol
[2:16:08] Vauss: it was me... I have a universal remote :)
[2:16:13] Juiicer: I think the only one who I guess would make sense would be Esfand on Cornwood. Maybe cause he's like iconic in stature?   But yea seems stranger why they'd do that. And then not make the Crims restart too
[2:16:22] Kkaedal: And suarez pits are still borderline insane
[2:16:37] RegulatorTTV: @88eg hahaha didn‚Äôt think about that. gun licenses are coming very soon
[2:17:00] RegulatorTTV: Suarez doesn‚Äôt pit he drives through your car lol
[2:17:03] Kkaedal: the parallels were so well executed
[2:17:28] weyland_yutani_x: that caddy looking PD car is on a whole other level tho
[2:17:29] USMCSapper: Since dickhead is late the price is now $600 cash or $700 rolls because of your emotional damage
[2:17:44] weyland_yutani_x: yes
[2:17:54] weyland_yutani_x: that car is insane
[2:18:15] Kkaedal: They just reduced the butcoin price for doing the cash exchange job
[2:18:19] KeyboardPlusFace: the caddy still sucks. fast in straights but cant turn worth a shit
[2:18:27] Kkaedal: So CG and company both got fucked
[2:18:32] RegulatorTTV: I watched Tessa do a laundry heist last night with her crew and they jumped in a Camaro looking car and that thing flys. got up to 185.
[2:18:38] Kkaedal: from 250 to 100 butcoin
[2:18:39] Hey_its_Mady: The Taurus is too op in terms of taking damage. That car can tank everything and still catch up to you in a blink of a eyes
[2:18:39] Mickerson2: think will look like a tuna can with maybe 2 wheels and still drive fine
[2:18:52] BinkyLea: with Ricjhard

[2:19:03] Mickerson2: She did one with the boys last night also
[2:19:10] Juiicer: Tessa off the deep end in 4.0? lol
[2:19:10] RegulatorTTV: Richard was on the second one.
[2:19:14] Hey_its_Mady: Tessa did one with CG then with her own crew
[2:19:22] RegulatorTTV: her negotiations where on point lol

[4:39:30] Damnitben: Oh, wonder what prompted that.  Oh well.  lol
[4:39:34] duckhunter_88: you own the sewer as much as they do
[4:40:33] mikecollin12: thats your extended basement lol
[4:41:06] RegulatorTTV: property rights extend to the core of the planet and includes sewage systems lol
[4:41:32] shadow200283: mineral rights
[4:41:37] BinkyLea: yeah you have "mineral right"
[4:41:53] TheTitanic: that depends on the deed to the property
[4:41:54] BinkyLea: depends on the land and the rights existing when you purchase
[4:41:54] duckhunter_88: you should be taxing them instead of them taxing you for being down in the sewer
[4:41:55] Eskoo1: watch there will be blood
[4:42:09] Damnitben: 'as far as you like' apparently
[4:42:22] BinkyLea: lol
[4:42:25] BinkyLea: no
[4:42:29] TheTitanic: my house i own nothing below, my ranch i own all rights
[4:42:34] BitShifting: Ad Coelum Doctrine: The traditional legal concept is called the "ad coelum" doctrine (Latin for "to the sky and to the depths"). This suggests a property owner owns the land, plus the airspace above and the subsurface below to potentially infinite distances.
[4:42:39] Damnitben: but not sure in regards to sewers etc.  But country wise 100%
[4:42:47] BitShifting: thats Gemini googles chatgpt
[4:43:00] BinkyLea: most homes in suburban areas  do not convey those types of rights
[4:43:13] NUNAMAKERZ: it actually varies by state but here in Tx there really isnt a max depth
[4:43:20] RegulatorTTV: each jurisdiction has a set of property rights that go along with the title. varies widely
[4:43:29] BinkyLea: 25+ years in this
[4:43:33] super_soker: yes but just because u own the land doesnt mean u own the mineral or water rights
[4:43:40] BinkyLea: no, there are "air rights" as well
[4:43:41] Tera: well, there's zoning limits
[4:43:43] Jessimi: There are air space regulations in some areas.
[4:43:44] shadow200283: got to watchout for airplanes
[4:43:49] BanditWeazle: You can't dig deep enough to have the property lines taper in
[4:43:50] Lepaca: I bet the HoA would just love that
[4:44:48] BinkyLea: that is good
[4:45:01] Moobs_: have you found out if pennies are used for anything yet?

[4:48:16] USMCSapper: Can you throw a penny?

[4:48:47] Jessimi: K threw a penny at the 'Minecraft Villager' dude yesterday lol
[4:48:49] B3arded_B3ar: Maybe for plants? Like when you put a Penny in the stand for a christmas tree.
[4:49:45] USMCSapper: A penny for your thoughts?
[4:49:53] RegulatorTTV: have you tested throwing them at a car and person? maybe they can be used as weapons hahaha sewers throwing penny‚Äôs
[4:50:08] TheKhanGreen: It‚Äôd be weird if the penny is involved in the new heist somehow
