[0:23:06] fedewicos: i feel like apple vision pro is a way for apple to say that this is what they are capable to do with their technology, it's best to wait a couple years to see the development of the integration

[0:23:45] skinnybullreflexes: thoughts on the new skibidi toilet episode ?
[0:23:46] bxczv: If google kept developing the google glass, it would very well be mainstream now but they decided to abandon it. If technologies like in vision pro can be implemented in a smaller more normal looking glasses, then it will indeed be very cool. That's what google glass could have become but google just abandoned it
[0:23:47] rainhopp: That's the guy from overwatch
[0:23:51] ommstar1: yeah I just woke up after sleeping to the least stream and then saw him go live again, nice
[0:24:05] bhavin2707: @gtaonlinegameplay333 vision pro doesn't support maximum of things right now. Vision pro 2 will be way more advanced and better when it comes out.
[0:24:06] kretin_17: Matto, what was the most painful thing about pacifist?
