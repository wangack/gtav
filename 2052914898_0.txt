[1:04:44] magnets_: feels like you would only get penalized if you kept going after a senior called it off vs not calling it off yourself
[1:04:54] Prollos: the idea is to not have units tied up in the same call for an hour, more so with the lower numbers atm etc
[1:04:54] Panos_97: You only chase nonstop when you know the driver is a violent felon if I'm not mistaken
[1:04:56] Fettystab: its better to do that rp wise because lifes are at stake plus you dont have hour long chases with unlimited car swaps
[1:05:07] StreamElements: If you would like to support my stream you can subscribe here! twitch.tv/uhsnow/subscribe
[1:05:11] IsetfireIzetfire: I mean its a normal chase, I would say once there are bank robberies you could chase a bit longer

[1:05:14] idenkaz_: ALOO Snuw
[1:05:14] X4320: maybe for now, but it increases the "wanted level" and its maybe nicer once you catch him/her ?
[1:05:16] Senna_Minxy: @BluGiant uhsBlue uhsSpin uhsTea
[1:05:16] magnets_: have you been penalized for it?
[1:05:19] Vapo: understand it on low prio calls like traffic sitations and stuff, but surely banks etc it wont be so common
[1:05:22] vylkodav: There will be more chases once violent crimes pick up.
[1:05:26] bearblarg: depends on the situation like he had very little PC, but like to break off someone in like a bank job gonna feel bad

[1:11:13] OdilonRedonn: so what are the circumstances that causes a chase to be called off, cus i heard there was 10 min mark but it's clearly bs
[1:11:17] miiks7: Jackie just at home mining bitcoin and watching Mighty Ducks
[1:11:18] vipslampy15: Heard a few people refer to eugene as a "problem back in the day" so i understand that.

[1:12:01] Senna_Minxy: so its like real police chases where they get called off due to danger to the public
[1:12:02] SpootenFreeman: jackie didnt do anything wrong feels, like some people want things done some way, and are holding onto grudges.
[1:12:08] Meet2thakkar: yeah
[1:12:27] msnzonegamingadvocate: Who could possibly hold a grudge? i dont get it
[1:12:33] solid_swede: I do find it amusing, that both Snow and Ziggy. The two people who were granted the state positions, both aren't officers anymore.

[1:15:10] Not_Very_Good_Pigeon: "sorry guys I'm too busy tearing people a part in my head"
[1:15:22] MEX_: Almost none of the RP is bound to a rank, I dont know why you'd want to chase only for ranks unless you like being an authority in the department

[6:14:03] StageName: One thing people dont think about is that cops had to learn so much stuff and put a ton of effort in it

[6:15:10] Kaiyo_exe: There needs to be a balanced ecosystem
[6:15:22] Kinamazing: how many slots on the server nowadays?

[6:15:27] SporkPixie: yeah Like I can do other characters, but I enjoy doing MC RP
[6:15:29] WhiteWolvesTV: As Esfand once said on his stream, it's hard to play Civ/Criminal. Because you need and make your own story, while police there atleast is some foundation made already.
[6:15:48] scott99901: that goes for EMS too
[6:15:51] SkyGames024: From what I learned through RP and and smaller servers that You cops cant have fun without crims and crims cant have fun without cops. it goes hand and hand imo
