[0:17:52] Chrissy1337: i mean he thinks experienced cops are needed to train all the new cops they want to have
[0:17:54] Booyal: he wants FTO capable cops to help get the PD working since crims are progressing faster than PD basically
[0:18:02] Christian2920: FTO burnout is very real already
[0:18:04] Lawdie123: I think cops are burning out becuase there is enough people to train
[0:18:09] GrumpyTreeFrog: @uhSnow i think he just wants ppl thet have been cops already that wont take as long being a cadet
[0:18:16] Siepels: pd not being what they hoped for, and they know they made a mistake at start
[0:18:26] yattyz: FTO's - Missing skeleton Crew - Slow recruitment since missing FTO's - and just how some things are done in PD

[0:21:19] CarolineSwitched: uhsCozy
[0:21:20] Senna_Minxy: That was one of curvye's worries is ppl burning out but not necessarily due to being an FTO, It was more to them being short staff

[1:36:25] xBonezy: nintendo can get bent
[1:36:35] toxic_coffee_: Nuck fintendo
[1:36:38] Chrissy1337: if it was the case, it would have happened already
[1:36:39] TomatoPhalanges: all nintendo have said are they they're investigating
[1:36:42] CeruleanBandit: they would've sued already, they litigate everything
[1:36:46] Codingale: they said so, it's written in my head cannon!
[1:36:51] the_only_tetra: if nintendo could take it down they probably would have by now
[1:36:52] Nomnomperson: If Nintendo was going to do something, they would of done something when they first announced the game years ago LUL
[1:36:53] TomatoPhalanges: jinx
[1:36:59] JonasInDenmark: Lol okay.. Palworld has been in development for 3 years. Japan has so me really strick copyright laws. If there was a problem Palworld would already be gone
[1:37:06] Nomnomperson: ^
[1:37:06] JonasInDenmark: some of the*
[1:37:16] JustSteveThings: Both nintendo and palworld are based in japan and they don't have free use laws there, if they were going to stop it it would of been years ago
[1:37:17] Lawdie123: I mean palworld has sold 19m copies so far so I think they have the cash to fend off nintendo for awhile now KEKW
[1:37:18] j42stin: pokemon is the most valuable brand in the world and nintendo is historically litigious, so it's not unreasonable to ancitipate something
[1:37:23] Aarodnik: Nintendo probably said that because everyone kept tagging them KEKW
[1:37:29] solid_swede: Nintendo can't can they? Palworld creatures are all AI generated so they can't be done for copyright, as far as I'm aware. I could be incorrect
[1:37:29] JonasInDenmark: My english really failed me there lol

[1:39:43] j42stin: because gamefreak
[1:39:43] meeto_tv: pokemmo kinda but not that game wasnt 3d
[1:39:54] Karlishes: because switch can't handle it
[1:40:07] Nomnomperson: I mean I guess they count Pokemon Go as that LUL Which doesn't really count but yknow, that's the closest we'll get
[1:40:13] Chrissy1337: Nintendo on PC OMEGALUL
[1:40:17] Chrissy1337: yeah good luck
[1:40:18] twisty_mc: lets be honest though, GameFreak are happy to churn out switch clones like CoD.
[1:40:19] MarinoV1: with the amount that Pokemon sells, they haven't felt the need to make it better. maybe this whole ordeal will change that finally.
[1:40:27] j42stin: nintendo.. sells the switch, possibly?
[1:40:31] SurreyHuntress: @nomnomperson agreed.
[1:40:32] CeruleanBandit: it's a huge missed opportunity for nintendo
[1:40:51] Lawdie123: I mean look how popular the 3rd party pokemon mmo

[1:41:28] Lawdie123: Pokemon Revolution is one of them
[1:41:35] meeto_tv: it was very good but no where near what it could have been
[1:41:39] Shocky1991: I don't see Pokémon move away from Nintendo. Thus I think it is highly unlike it is coming to PC
[1:41:41] the_only_tetra: they had one on n64 didn't they
[1:41:41] joe01522: they know they can release dog shit and people will lap it up basically
[1:41:58] Keybz: they can just wait untill palworld is that.. buy it and port in real pokemon n cash in..
[1:42:03] JustSteveThings: They have a business model that works successfully so they don't want to try reinventing the wheel
[1:42:04] j42stin: they've shut down smaller projects without a sweat
[1:42:21] JustSteveThings: No risks all the rewards
[1:42:37] LindaBTW: @joe01522 also feel once they make something amazing they will be expected to do better each time
[1:42:46] MonstaMel: Dune... supposidly this year
[1:42:52] solid_swede: Pokemon have the same principles as Fifa. They just release a new game with the same game play and it sells millions.

[1:44:52] nicho__las: its all ships
[1:45:05] Beopuppy85: Load Tarkov, die first raid. Turn off Tarkov
[1:45:16] Fade37: Covid over higher is hugely overstated, just used as an excuse now
[1:45:18] TomatoPhalanges: Skull & Bones is classic vaporware, it's a Duke Nukem Forever situation
[1:45:19] tabooshk: ubisoft making a game worse than AC4 gameplay KEKW
[1:45:19] Chrissy1337: Skull and Bones, the game that got delayed so much im actually surprised its going into beta KEKW
[1:45:21] JonasInDenmark: u just want a game that is fully Developed and actually finished but i guess that isnt a thing anymore
[1:45:24] AlexMagas: When that comes out, just replay AC4

[1:45:48] MonstaMel: i'm reallyt excited for Dune, but i'm also a huge nerd for survival games
[1:46:10] MarinoV1: @Chrissy1337 The crazy thing is it would've been canceled, but Ubisoft is contractually obligated to put it out because of a deal they made with the Singapore government when they opened a studio there. It *has* to come out...eventually.
[1:46:18] CmdrPain: LUL

[6:07:36] MrBlueDevil: I know Cosmic posted it
[6:07:36] ancientpeas: It is interesting how many people gained weight during lockdown and then there are those that went on a health kick.  Maybe boredom eating?
[6:07:36] Bakemaan: I think i remember that photo
[6:07:45] X4320: the group foto in front of the ramen restaurant ?

[6:09:48] Twomps: Oh, hello. who's this handsome fella?
[6:09:54] vnxshh: losing weight is just discipline, the concept is very simple, eat less calories than you burn in a day, no special methods, just stick to it
[6:10:06] namedkyle: glad its been working out, keep it up, you've inspired me.
[6:10:34] Bakemaan: and training your body for the change, your body knows best.
[6:10:34] ifragile: sugarssssssss
[6:10:37] FCMotive: it's just math
[6:10:45] boteddie: @vnxshh the only thing is lots of people natural burn more or less than others, so the concept is simple but the workload is different for everyone
[6:10:45] dnoltie: Cut down on calories and cut out garbage food.
[6:10:49] Mr__Muggles: soda was a huge one for me
[6:10:51] DJGari23: i did the same. sugar is the culprit NODDERS
[6:10:53] solid_swede: You've just describe my daily diet lol

[6:11:20] 0liver1891: Airfryer is OP
[6:11:21] xdr0ptx: i tried that but without a pop i turn into a big asshole lol. i got told that at work by a few friends before i got laid off
[6:11:21] LordXaras: I got an airfryer and cut my takeout habit almost entirely
[6:11:23] miiks7: Going from a 70-ish kg fellow with high metabolism to suddenly gaining A LOT of weight when I started studying again was really suprising
[6:11:28] xdr0ptx: i have an air frier oven and love it
[6:11:34] Bakemaan: air frier needs a nerf for sure
[6:11:43] DJGari23: i use a liner for mine. so i dont clean it all the time NODDERS
[6:11:45] itsbluejean: Airfryer option on our new Ninja oven has been a gamechanger for us as well

[6:11:59] miiks7: Same with me, just when i passed 21
[6:11:59] Netris: Metabolism doesn't really change from 1 to 65
[6:12:07] itsbluejean: Ninja is such a great brand Kreygasm
[6:12:20] 0Douglas: eat less, move more.. when i was working during summer I used to walk so much per day and ended up losing around 1kg a week, then uni started again and the stress and ya know saabKEK
[6:12:21] Bakemaan: if you have a cast iron pan then for sure keep using that, but yeah get rid of your "non stick" teflon bullshit LUL
[6:12:23] xdr0ptx: @Netris factors can cause it to change as u get older but age alone normally doesnt
[6:12:39] TheWarLion: I went from 95kg to 70kg. 1 week later I had a life altering experience. regained all that lost weight, topping at 99kg. Now im back at 90kg, but the road feels thougher
[6:12:55] boteddie: its because baking soda contains 0 calories too lol
