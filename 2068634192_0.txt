[2:37:35] nl_f0x: BENSONED ON A DIFFERENT LEVEL
[2:37:57] KitKatSNAAAACKS: It's also kind of hard when the sever only allows for 220 people and what, over half of them are likely streamers with priority queue. The others are left to fend in the queue for HOURS.
[2:38:25] Fossabot:  whipStinky Please do not tell streamer what to do or how to do it unless specifically asked by streamer, even if he forgets or doesn't see something. Back-seating acts as an unwanted external influence to the roleplay.
[2:38:40] KitKatSNAAAACKS: But I also agree that Dundee does seem to run past people quite often and could stop to chat.
[2:38:58] theextremelylongnamekid: imo only people that place them should be able to destroy them

[2:40:40] Zairichii: I think it was just as hard the 1st time but hard cuz you're doing it all over again
[2:40:44] Lord_Machiavellian: If it's a server bug, can't you report it to bugstars? Maybe get recompensated?
[2:40:59] skutza: dundee is stuck on the past still, those people told you know but you keep holding on - you have jason and rusty who imo are bondi but dundee looks past them for past members.
[2:40:59] pepe_silvia_as: just gotta keep on doing what you're doing, keep your head up

[2:41:30] gizzmoharding: NO BALLS
[2:41:41] Lord_Machiavellian: Is BBMC restricted to Australian members?
[2:41:49] skutza: it's a common thing for dundee, to push those closest to him away and focus on the ones who don't care - that's what he's doing rn with focusing on the list instead of finding new people etc.
[2:41:57] lordofspin: Do you want to be BBMC? WHY NOTTT???

[3:03:18] DOWNBAD_ELLY: Progress now chaos later NODDERS
[3:03:19] theextremelylongnamekid: need a car so badly
[3:03:19] floody555: Therein lies ur problem, you don't know what u want KEKW
[3:03:20] Theawesomeraccoon: progress so you CAN be more chaotic?
[3:03:21] itsautumnxo: both
[3:03:21] Valroz: tommy said he had an appointment earlier didn't he
[3:03:22] geckoZen: need progress to be able to be chaotic
[3:03:22] Bigcountry182: Progression = chaos later

[3:03:34] djsweet2: U gotta pick on3 thing and work on it progression or chaos
[3:03:37] AJjack72: @whippy BBMC is a chaotic group so I would say stay true to it
[3:03:46] nl_f0x: You've got to know when to hold 'em Know when to fold 'em Know when to walk away And know when to run
[3:03:49] SuperKoorie: emotive terms. Brotherhood, Love, Fun, Loyalty, Trust, etc
[3:03:49] AnonymousTrace_: what is the process of actually being hangy to prospect to patch? what does it actually take?
[3:03:52] KitKatSNAAAACKS: If you want people to join, you need to progress. SO many people are down bad, they want to find a form of stability in a group/gang.
[3:03:53] AnthemOfFlame: ya but noone wants to join the chaos... so i would guess u need to to the opposite...
[3:03:55] geckoZen: peepoShrug purely focus on robbing sanitation workers and burn bridges
[3:04:02] floody555: and be clear of debt
[3:04:06] floody555: then some
[3:04:17] FriendlyAF88: at the moment need cars and a home, once bbmc is seeing around in bbmc cars doing shit the people will come
[3:04:22] jmjrjm: Any follow up with PD and cornwood
[3:04:24] theextremelylongnamekid: nobody has much to offer
[3:04:25] KitKatSNAAAACKS: I would grind to get into the crypto gang and try to get caught up as quick as you can.
[3:04:28] fadebruhhh: BBMC will rise from the ashes trust
[3:04:29] skutza: you can grow but you are focusing to much on the past
[3:04:29] ImGenX: @Whippy Collin will come to the Billy in a wheelchair "What are you cunts doing in my Billy?? I'm 63 years old."
[3:04:30] dingbatco: need a money maker
[3:04:31] MJT_au: I think the hit and miss of crime is a problem, and without a house/base people aren't going to want to join
[3:04:58] sao_mito: Yes
[3:05:00] itsDaniBear: No BBMC wasn't a mistake

[3:05:05] yolfiic: this is NEW bbmc
[3:05:07] skutza: have to remember bbmc was a powerhouse top notch people when it started @Whippy , everything takes time.
[3:05:07] VernTheSatyr: Rebrand?
[3:05:08] geckoZen: realizing this for the 10th time
[3:05:09] sao_mito: No
[3:05:12] skutza: wasn'T
[3:05:12] AnthemOfFlame: bang boys was good imo
[3:05:17] countermixture: Become a clown.
[3:05:17] KitKatSNAAAACKS: Does Dundee know what's going on with crypto?
[3:05:24] ImGenX: Nope
[3:05:25] countermixture: C l o w n
[3:05:26] AnthemOfFlame: well u cant quit now... cuz u get the few ppl tht are by u...
[3:05:29] kimosabii1: i think its more trying to make the OLD bbmc. need to make a NEW bbmc
[3:05:35] Kronzo: James Kelly Industries is recruiting :D
[3:05:37] DOWNBAD_ELLY: NODDERS Second part is right but first part is wrong. The BBMC name should be kept but it is a NEW BBMC Dee gotta let go of the old.
[3:05:40] floody555: DOOM and Spiral...... Slap urself Strimmer
[3:05:42] Fossabot:  Whippy returns to NoPixel! - https://youtu.be/dvWQK7hZbgM
[3:05:44] Thanlen: You need a few key people who are around more to help make things work
[3:05:44] AnonymousTrace_: In all seriousness, BBMC isn‚Äôt the issue I think it‚Äôs more so the process to becoming a member. If everyone is perfect by prospect, what‚Äôs left to achieve to becoming patch, etc etc @whippy
[3:05:45] KitKatSNAAAACKS: What does Dundee want in the long run?
[3:05:46] VernTheSatyr: Maybe
[3:05:49] NoranorTV: dont give up!
[3:05:51] jmjrjm: Probably a different approach to the BBMC?
[3:05:54] Ughers: Not everyone will fit with BBMC but you need to bring in people to see who will.
[3:05:54] fadebruhhh: Lumber Union?
[3:05:57] itsDaniBear: Dundee is a natural leader, even when he isn't a leader he leads
[3:05:59] skutza: @Whippy you are to focused on the past and can't let it go, this is a NEW bbmc stop thinking about the old and find new faces.
[3:06:07] geckoZen: u mean the club that shot u
[3:06:08] yolfiic: BBMC is great. it's just going to be a while. dee has to let go go OLD bbmc and move foward!
[3:06:10] ImGenX: Pez FallCry
[3:06:11] Apporatory: Dundee is not a quitter
[3:06:11] dingbatco: new hangaround process
[3:06:14] theextremelylongnamekid: need to meet new people. people that have joined in the past might want to do something different so it‚Äôs a waste of time
[3:06:15] VernTheSatyr: Maybe he needs to take a road trip
[3:06:25] bakedgingersnaps: You ever take the Gallup strengths test? I really think that would help you. then you can try and play more to your strengths
[3:06:28] coliinn: if you dont felel ike you want to lead no need to force that
[3:06:30] IamthaKingslayer: prospect rusty and jason
[3:06:31] agentofchaoso7: before the getting shot on the oceanside of course though AAAA
[3:06:32] DOWNBAD_ELLY: Dee won‚Äôt get old BBMC back. Times have changed  NODDERS
[3:06:32] KitKatSNAAAACKS: Okay, so what if that isn't achievable. What else would he want?
[3:06:32] geckoZen: put that in perspective, Dee got shot by his own club twice in 2022
[3:06:34] AnonymousTrace_: Unrelated but any word on possibly seeing more BBMC clothing in the city? @whippy
[3:06:34] mahyou10: Never give up
[3:06:35] yolfiic: YES
[3:06:38] itsDaniBear: Yes
[3:06:39] floody555: ur not giving urself the time u said u needed at the start of all this...... Time
[3:06:40] ZolokThe: Yes
[3:06:42] dr_mccoy21: the 2022 BBMC took a while to get going too, wasnt it like 4 people for months?
[3:06:42] jgunns68: Weren't the Bang Bois doing ok?
[3:06:42] wildfood: Driving school...
[3:06:42] MikeOnSky: It takes too long to become a member, like everyone wants to be a part of something, but if it takes to long not may will go and wait.
[3:06:43] FriendlyAF88: you have to treat it like bbmc 4.0 a whole new bbmc, not a bbmc like 2.0 or 3.0
[3:06:44] blightgreen: you could just give up and do g6 runs
[3:06:47] itsDaniBear: YES
[3:06:49] ReinBork: Dundee needs to stop waiting for people to come to him and start poaching people. There's a lot of civ workers waiting for a gang/group to pick them up. And you have a few hangies that are deserving of a jacket
[3:06:49] Ughers: It's hard to go back, forwards is the only way really.
[3:06:51] yolfiic: dont give up! we LOVE BBMC!
[3:06:51] Theawesomeraccoon: dont give up now, you still got the people who are in there with you rn.
[3:06:54] IamthaKingslayer: maybe dundee needs to have a smoke lol
[3:06:54] AngelsKissCGW: I don‚Äôt think BBMC is a mistake but a new version not just bringing back the old
[3:06:57] KitKatSNAAAACKS: *trying to get some critical thinking going here, I'm an analyst after all, lol*
[3:07:00] Kronzo: You have Kelly and Tommy, thats all you really need 2 strong comrads of war
[3:07:01] iEnzan: There's always "The company".
[3:07:01] Innorruk: this is definitely better than bikini streams
[3:07:06] DOWNBAD_ELLY: NODDERS YES
[3:07:08] geckoZen: WeRiot cactus for prospect
[3:07:09] FoosballSportsNetwork2: The up good BBMC.
[3:07:11] Grioghar182: That shit took a LONG time to build. Just be Dundee, the charismatic leader we all know. Itll be right
[3:07:13] FriendlyAF88: people will allways come and go happens in everything and u can not stop that
[3:07:15] Nomad_Ninja: every member that walks away, is another member you don't have to kick later
[3:07:17] itsDaniBear: It isn't in Dundee's nature to quit
[3:07:20] ImGenX: @AngelsKissCGW bottedLove
[3:07:21] floody555: U have reonvented in a way, no Hierarchy
[3:07:22] theextremelylongnamekid: merge with the company
[3:07:25] nl_f0x: I think you shouldn't worry, give it time.  rome wasn't build in one day.
[3:07:26] „Ç∏„Çß„Éº„Çä: so why you left Mozlee then?
[3:07:26] Valroz: Rivers don't go back to 2022
[3:07:29] ala5kan_: other gangs are doing jobs while y'all just piss around
[3:07:30] NoranorTV: Yeah company ain't it
[3:07:35] iamloyaltytv: Ideally the gang needs to start off as a network that people enjoy being arround that should try avoid robbing friends of people but help people first then it can take a demon arc
[3:07:35] Innorruk: so how many times have you quit
[3:07:37] Theawesomeraccoon: monkaW
[3:07:39] iamRYPE_: too much of the server is too focused on progression and not focusing on RP. you‚Äôre one of the best to watch because your RP  is top notch. keep focusing on RP
[3:07:41] MegaKarp101: Maybe stop trying to be 2022 bbmc and try to be 2024 bbmc

[3:07:57] yolfiic: @iamRYPE_ !
[3:08:02] AnonymousTrace_: Learn from what didn‚Äôt work in BBMC and BBS and use it to make changes in BBMC. Learn from the mistakes but don‚Äôt harp on the good times too much.
[3:08:17] skutza: @MegaKarp101 DonkBonk  it into his head pwease
[3:08:20] Krisgadgets: if it was easy everyone Would Do it  Your rules Your Club Your Turf  look at the guys You have For Now not For the Ones You Dont

[3:10:53] ReinBork: new BBMC should be a little more open to baby crims and new members. The giant waiting list is from previous members. Open your arms to some of the solo crims and teach them the way
[3:10:54] Innorruk: 4.0 is GTAIV it just looks purdy
[3:10:56] AnthemOfFlame: mary will join for sure :)

[3:14:14] itsDaniBear: The BBMC Patch Games!!!
[3:14:28] bjornirnsidee: I think the biggest issue is that the city is way different to early bbmc, its so much quicker unfortunatly so recruitment needs to be quicker to progress
[3:14:45] iamloyaltytv: D needs a dart
[3:14:46] yolfiic: @geckoZen AAAA

[3:23:51] MDCproject: I mean... since when has BBMC compared their success to the success of other groups? BBMC does not need to be like every other group. I think that is where the anxiety is coming from.
[3:23:54] yolfiic: dont give up on BBMC!
[3:23:58] coolboarder5: Just a slow start
[3:24:02] iamloyaltytv: thing are normally slow to start with are they not?

[3:24:28] iamRYPE_: BBMC in 3.0 took a little while to grow, don‚Äôt try to speed run to get back to where you were. good things take time

[3:24:32] PandaTheRealest: momo said he wants to learn them.  teach them and they will come.  you‚Äôre a great teacher

[3:24:42] jukey208122: Sad reality is OG bbmc will never be recreated need to look to new beginnings with new people
[3:24:44] skutza: bbmc in 3.0 started with 3 people, 4.0 is starting with 3 people - it took literal months even a year to get even clsoe to 10 people.
[3:24:46] Ughers: It's a tough one, you want good people but you need to open up and let people try out to find them.
[3:24:54] fuzionender19: so no days off till you get lillth?
[3:24:56] IamthaKingslayer: gonna end up losing the ones u have now if u keep thinking ahead about the ones u want

[3:26:49] TheeBudz: DinkDonk NEW PROPAGANDA POSTERS DinkDonk
[3:26:50] jukey208122: Sadly 4.0 is wildly different to 3.0
[3:26:58] AnonymousTrace_: While it‚Äôs understandable, if you always hesitate to bring in members it only hinders BBMC growth the way you want it to be @whippy
[3:27:12] skutza: another issue as well is, you are thinking of already up good bbmc when bbmc started off small and down bad and knew nothing - everything takes time , you just have to keep pushing.
[3:27:13] markisue: I LOVED BBMC 2.0
[3:27:21] geckoZen: SEE? BLUBBERSWTF
[3:27:41] OpyPhupapy: We could also check dark locations, alleywalls to steal distilleries for us for free?
[3:27:49] whipster453: @whippy wasent that because 2.0 grew to fast
[3:27:50] yolfiic: understandable. but keep pushing!
[3:27:52] AnonymousTrace_: BBMC doesn‚Äôt even need a lot of members, there just has to be a clear cut way to actually be a member and not just holding them in the limbo
