[0:26:32] LaFleur_13: retarded chat
[0:26:32] SpaceCowboy94: Yes. They have public bounties posted every day out.
[0:26:32] Bulfwyne: ahhhh travpiHmm yeee
[0:26:34] bazzela: Yes it does
[0:26:34] 50_tiger: Or at least a phone app
[0:26:38] Grivvvy: yeah i liked it on NP
[0:26:39] bazzela: chatters are dumb
[0:26:40] ItsMeComfort: it‚Äôs good for warrants, witness statements, and bounty hunting.
[0:26:40] jc_e1x: The phone should tell you whether or not a contact is "active"
[0:26:42] PoorMamaAde: But if Bounty uses it then why can't PD?
[0:26:42] crims0nlight: @kyle the bounty hunters are tryharding in both cases
[0:26:43] Kiitzu: I think both are fine
[0:26:43] 50_tiger: maybe people getting caught up in MDW
[0:26:43] Grinch_420: dude why are you so funny remember when you slapped that cop when he wouldn‚Äôt get out your way lol
[0:26:45] ByteMyWire: I think it does .. real bounty hunting is mostly about information technology
[0:26:45] wAkefromVR: yeah when people arent living in city 24/7 cant know when people around
[0:26:46] angry_jon: i see your point
[0:26:47] vantarts: it's your server Shrug
[0:26:47] Vogels: If thats ALL it shows its good
[0:26:49] stuartgavin1: I think it's good for RP for both
[0:26:50] lateral_control: Just one indicator?
[0:26:51] nullpker: good point. it would progress instantly
[0:26:52] WHYDEW: meta mdw is less bad than meta getting online on bounty hunter NODDERS
[0:26:55] audiyomind: @tyjora slurpee kyleisFat
[0:26:57] Reptar1025: i think it would be fine if people dont misuse it
[0:26:57] Vondill: Meta mdw enables is just a quality of life feature that helps facilitate rp imo
[0:27:01] thefahking1andonly: if you are wanted, that should be a concern either way
[0:27:02] lateral_control: gonna get spawn camped
[0:27:03] KingTheTurtle: @Kyle Maybe flavor it like 'bank activity detected' ?
[0:27:06] Sweets_64: Maybe incorporate it into a last seen at this time at this place thing that updates every hour or 2? @Kyle
[0:27:08] Livelethal: I don't know if it would be good on the MDW, but at the same time- knowing if someone is online would be helpful for bounty hunting
[0:27:08] Kiitzu: immersion wise, the people WOULD still be in the city, it just helps facilitate interactions @Kyle
[0:27:09] SirMeowingtonSr: maybe if it just says if they've been seen in the last 24 hours
[0:27:11] bazzela: NODDERS it does og
[0:27:12] cbrownnu: I think they should be able to see if Bounty Hunters are online as well
[0:27:13] The_Devilyouknow: @Vondill applebeShlorp applebeHey kyleisHug

[0:27:21] lundo2fundo: @vondill sup kyleisHug kyleisEZ
[0:27:23] WHYDEW: sure
[0:27:28] PhantomRogue: the only other thing could be "pings" where if a suspect used a gov't thing, Hunters ot a notificate, saying, "XXX was just spotted"
[0:27:29] Vondill: @the_devilyouknow kyleisFlower
[0:27:29] Shaggymatt: d4n1Trashdance d4n1Trashdance d4n1Trashdance d4n1Trashdance
[0:27:31] TJOddity: maybe a tag saying active if they used their bank account recently
[0:27:31] vantarts: only for bounty hunters is fine
[0:27:33] KingTheTurtle: @Vondill HeyGuys
[0:27:33] octodaddy: Only if it pings them that a bounty hunter is looking them up @kyle fair is fair Kappa
[0:27:36] nullpker: would it be more difficult to get a bounty license then?
[0:27:39] mr_deepsense_: Maybe bank tracking on fugitives for the bounty hunters? That makes it look more natural @Kyle
[0:27:40] Bulfwyne: AHHHhhhh
[0:27:40] Vondill: @lundo2fundo kyleisKiss
[0:27:42] Coltronn_: hat carl was wildin last night off stream LUL
[0:27:44] EmMazingRP: i appreciate the RP I had with ya Kyle!
[0:27:44] SpaceCowboy94: What if it just tracks ATM location usages
[0:27:44] ScaryJerry94: What happens when the city is full of bounty hunters
[0:27:45] TxSavage956: how about bank account tracker? cell phone tracker
[0:27:49] TyJoRa: @Kyle I think a "Signed On via Twinsta" makes more sense. Gives the bounty hunter a hunt if online.
[0:27:49] 50_tiger: Like gives a message last seen 9 min ago or something?
[0:27:50] KingTheTurtle: LMAO
[0:27:52] whiteash414: That sounds fine
[0:27:52] WHYDEW: maybe bounty hunters and justices?
[0:27:53] Vondill: @kingtheturtle HenrySmash
[0:27:53] KingTheTurtle: SIR YOU ARE BEING HUNTED
[0:27:53] Obi_Wan_Jabroni: it would help get a ball rolling, but that's about it and i don't think that's inherently bad.
[0:27:58] eskitz409: What about a train ticket timestamp
[0:27:59] skoadx: wasnt there a 'last seen' thing in the mdw
[0:28:00] hogshund: How do I beat up hat carl
[0:28:01] sterowentUS: then they can't share that info
[0:28:02] cbrownnu: cbrownnu subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 31 months! 
[0:28:03] MrBojangles371: i bet it would get abused in some sort of way eventually
[0:28:03] thefahking1andonly: Bail enforcement agents have different arresting powers than cops. BH have to rely on info to find their skiptraces
[0:28:04] Grivvvy: yeah just assume if you have overpaid fines youre being looked for
[0:28:05] Archaius: how would the goverment know when someone wakes up, makes no sense too
[0:28:06] Obi_Wan_Jabroni: @Vondill smash this Sussy
[0:28:07] therealUNPROFESSIONAL: It would be like a credit check notive
[0:28:07] Rem753: what like a star warning in the corner? OMEGALULiguess
[0:28:10] therealUNPROFESSIONAL: Notice
[0:28:10] foodie_na: Idk sounds fine
[0:28:10] octodaddy: YOU ARE BEING WATCHED
[0:28:12] Slesh5: yeah I think knowing when ppl are online on the character would work since it would balance the fact that this is a game and ppl can swap characters etc
[0:28:13] hogshund: Vibing hbu
[0:28:14] Zac_NZ: @hogshund play on the server
[0:28:14] Bulfwyne: say, if they use their cellphone ? then it says, "This persons around" that'd be cool NODDERS @Kyle
[0:28:15] Princeofiowa: how do the bounty hunters know they're awake in their apartment, neither make sense
[0:28:16] audiyomind: @hogshund pentawD
[0:28:16] Vondill: @obi_wan_jabroni HenrySmash
[0:28:16] WHYDEW: for QoL for bounty hunters i agree
[0:28:18] nullpker: an atm usage notifies you or something

[0:28:26] Anterra: Did you even get some sleep kyle ? I'm surprised you didn't lose your voice
[0:28:26] KingTheTurtle: @Kyle Maybe the bounter hunter MDW can get a ping for bank activity or like, a traffic cam sees their license plate etc
[0:28:27] lundo2fundo: @hogshund aayyy sup player kyleisHYPERS
[0:28:28] hogshund: @zac_nz planning to after I move!
[0:28:35] Zac_NZ: @hogshund Pog
[0:28:38] Athrun_Zala7: Hat carl is the hottest person in the city
[0:28:39] ConceptualDesigns: maybe a last known location system where it shows the last NPC they interacted with
[0:28:40] Obi_Wan_Jabroni: leg0s Madge
[0:28:42] Bulfwyne: Nice Hog EZ
[0:28:43] hogshund: @lundo2fundo sup
[0:28:44] Warjec: @Kyle Used to have a thing on an old server with Warrants and stuff where it said that a person was last seen or recently seen etc., which let officers know they were around
[0:28:45] SiliconDeath: what about a bounty hunter app on the fun that only shows wanted ppl statues ?
[0:28:48] lateral_control: just have an admin rule to ban meta use
[0:28:49] Annonc: maybe if you call them, you can tell from phone ringing if someone is online, that let crim phone number atleast
[0:28:50] kingroman5: as long as there is a timeout of like 8 hours per use.
[0:28:53] xwarnpeacex: just do more investigating and waiting
