[0:31:24] Anrisacia: I haven't really watched one either, but I assume having a full days worth of time left over after an 18 hour stream seems good
[0:31:30] AdamElJefe: Yeah, Kari has, like, almost 400 hours on her timer and she just does as long as she can each day and just pauses it. So not much different from what you did yesterday
[0:31:52] AdamElJefe: yeah, it got kinda nuts
[0:31:57] jamessonjewmcgee: @adameljefe holy
[0:32:13] plashir: Its day 2 of forever stream wahooo

[0:34:52] jamessonjewmcgee: only danger here is r murder kitty’s
[0:34:56] Vizi797: Yea I remember Spicy saying something like "Twitch is gonna cut me off so I'll end for 5 minutes and restart to get around it. It was crazy
[0:34:58] Tyler4AM: Like the longest I've ever stayed up was around that same amount of time and I was legit delirious and then slept for like 15 hours afterwards
