[0:52:09] xxunicornxx99: @infamouszeb peepoHey elllumFlower
[0:52:16] aistebor: you need to allow conversation to start and then take it somewhere..
[0:52:18] kcrossanim: Yeah thats interesting. I really like hearing what RPers think because obviously everyone has their own plots and its nice seeing it crossover
[0:52:19] RokasGaucys: same shit would happen irl
[0:52:29] Hitijahubessy: I loved how Tommy was bullying you and u guys went back and forth LUL
[0:52:41] infamouszeb: @xxunicornxx99 how’s your day been I cannot say to have a good one because it’s not the morning
[0:52:54] itspulchra: True
[0:53:01] xxunicornxx99: @infamouszeb, gigl im doing ok, jsut been busy with life really YEP hows u <33
[0:53:01] Hitijahubessy: haha yeah thats why I mentioned it LUL
[0:53:04] mikeee_dr: I can’t wait to see Eli shoot a gloc elllumWiggle
[0:53:15] Hitijahubessy: Eli was a bit too eager to have a chat with Tommy LUL LUL LUL
[0:53:20] infamouszeb: in a movie the villain never dies straight away it builds to it I get it
[0:53:21] danxd209: Tommy wants the content he's cold but he's open to RP
[0:53:24] RokasGaucys: I think Zerkaa always tries to interact with people
[0:53:34] kcrossanim: Tommy T is also been too busy dealing with CG LMAO
[0:53:40] dinsdale_: Eli should use a tazer instead of a gloc cos he's the nicest criminal
[0:53:43] infamouszeb: @xxunicornxx99 it’s good to be busy sometimes I hope you feel amazing at night

[0:54:11] spiritking1987: tommy t music elite YesYes
[0:54:11] itspulchra: A lot of the characters are well thought out
[0:54:13] LadyK227: it's just like irl. tell someone to eff off irl and they will leave you alone and walk away. makes sense.

[0:54:17] infamouszeb: @xxunicornxx99 hugs luv x
[0:54:19] whatthefults: I liked when Sykkuno joined RP because he didn’t really know anyone OOC. Made for a more interesting experience.
[0:54:19] cozmisc: Basically it's social awareness, you can't expect everyone to cater to the exact response you want from RP, have realistic expectations. The energy you put out matters
[0:54:19] Hitijahubessy: Abdul really helped him out at the start with everything
[0:54:24] TaySands: Eli loves to win people over (just like Ellum does)
[0:54:27] xxunicornxx99: @LadyK227 @whatthefults welcome in peepoHey

[0:56:23] Lycawoo: a mentor would be something who teaches you stuff
[0:56:23] xxunicornxx99: @Junaid_Ellam we dont have one here oop
[0:56:25] opalgamerq: mentor is more like a guide and teacher yeah
[0:56:26] craxg7: showing you the ropes of the city essentially
