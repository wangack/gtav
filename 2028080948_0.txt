[3:53:56] miniWD40: He really wasn’t a good choice… he doesn’t even talk about pop culture in any of his acts. And it was so cringe when he blamed the writers… literally right after the writers strike lmao
[3:54:03] dr_irisplays: Jokoy honestly is a hit or miss with his jokes. I can't stand most of them.
[3:54:29] it_brand0n: Yikes that's messed up
[3:54:34] ayjeeay237: he probably didn’t see it

[3:55:22] neocas: What the hell..? Just take the L, move on, no reason to add more Ls by doubling down
[3:55:26] Pingwhin: actually crazy, I feel like if you're actually talented 10 days should be plenty of time
[3:55:34] dr_irisplays: Yeah, he makes us Filipinos look bad....
[3:55:39] lillianrm: the worst part is the men saying Taylor “overreacted” by not reacting like??? it's giving “a man is allowed to react, women can only overreact”
[3:55:52] peanuttbahter: he went off-script a lot
[3:55:54] Inskill02: what happened??
[3:55:57] brandonstarrk: OMG icebox is back OMFG
[3:56:01] ferulics: i agree that a lot of his words were unnecessary rude and inconsiderate of writers and more, but hosting in general is a tough gig :/ to be a little empathetic

[3:56:53] neocas: Yeah exactly, just take the L with the writers. You should not disrespect your writers like that. That's your team
[3:57:16] ferulics: yeah for sure - the gif of taylor swift sipping her drink sums it all up lollll
[3:57:19] smailelee: saw the clip and had no idea who he was nor what he was sayin lol
[3:57:20] neocas: He just needed to be funny
[3:57:24] miniWD40: I feel like those awards shows really need someone who knows how to emcee instead of just a standup
[3:57:26] Laulipopii: The faces of the audience said everything about his jokes.
[3:57:30] neocas: Way too much
[3:57:31] TheRealMattyMo: Hiya EVON!

[3:58:26] dr_irisplays: A lot of his jokes are honestly distasteful. He makes fun of his mom a lot.
[3:58:36] neocas: I mean it's funny that he's being misogynistic giving the Barbie movie crap like that.
[3:58:56] miniWD40: @pnoobs1 I thought Gervais was great Lmaoo dude talks so much shit but he’s not wrong
