[6:56:40] despicablewebb: there is this one fly in my room British
[6:56:44] PantherVlll: @despicablewebb idk about that, high rep sanitation you get so much mats, and with group 6 and grime you pick up the same amount of packages/bags per stop as with no rep
[6:57:05] despicablewebb: 2.5k PantherVlll every run for grime

[6:57:31] somebadtiming: at least 6
[6:58:01] PantherVlll: @despicablewebb yes but it takes a long time, since you are still only picking up the same amount of packages as when you first started, i just think it's crazy you still get max 6 bags when you are maxed out at group 6
[6:58:28] despicablewebb: huh
[6:58:38] z1f3D: I think the more people you have in your group, the greater the chance of getting a larger number of bags
[6:58:53] mahtamsam: @ZiiiiF you can only have one other person

[7:01:02] PantherVlll: @despicablewebb yea but you are just making more stops per run, you still pick up the same amount of packages regardless if you are in a van or a big hauler
