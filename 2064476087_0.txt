[1:10:43] Maxwon: Lovemore is too pure for this
[1:10:56] kronzillla: LUL
[1:10:59] Fishnet83: @Maxwon mmhm. so innocent FeelsOkayMan

[1:11:28] e1london: Ask where Dez is
[1:11:36] Moonsc: AHAHAHA
[1:11:39] mezen29: tell them to pay upfront for the shit next time
[1:11:53] ThicccBrickBoi: Meta. He bought the house across the street
[1:11:56] kronzillla: replaced Sadge
[1:12:04] spoonfullofMusic: this is like the 4th time this happens no? KEKW
[1:12:13] darkmiepje: danish ark it iss
[1:12:19] Fishnet83: @gazzer2572 all depends on how you see it. What about all circuit boards AK got for gpu's. what about the external money others invested., etc etc Shruge it's tricky the math is never checking out since no one logged it.
[1:12:20] wiseaddict: there's no many options between leaving them, join other turf or stay there to do other stuff besides the weed game
[1:12:21] jmo_67: You can't explain it any more clearly than you did
[1:12:22] kronzillla: welp we know whos gettin dickheads first drive by KEKW
[1:12:40] juneOT: time to take over sani
[1:12:44] juneOT: big money
[1:12:46] 1evilshark: paid upfront was always the solution
[1:12:49] Celascion: time to call the other weed growers and ask how they get people to pay up KEKW
[1:12:49] femcatboys: need like a spread sheet with % of who gets what each brick
[1:12:57] kronzillla: time for gunner KEKW
[1:12:59] Fishnet83: @1evilshark for real NODDERS
[1:13:00] xtheexendx: trav, is dhead really upset?
[1:13:05] juneOT: LUL
[1:13:09] jaycedace00: bring back gunner
[1:13:09] e1london: yeah actual RP is lacking
[1:13:13] juneOT: ik it stupid
[1:13:18] kronzillla: here*
[1:13:23] sunchipsz: bro just tell him u want respect, ur not being honest
[1:13:25] sub_ohmu: Yeah, Grinding way too important atm on np
[1:13:29] spoonfullofMusic: if you want some light rp: bring a flashlight Kappa
[1:13:30] Fishnet83: Well since even robberies are locked behind money you gotta get it somehow Shruge
[1:13:34] Gurgle_Firewater: robbing grinders is poppin lately tho
[1:13:40] mezen29: raid them with gunner
[1:13:47] wiseaddict: yes yall just fall for that so easily
[1:13:51] Hummerino: Smadge time to get expunged and join PD
[1:13:57] TheDev97: its all about money
[1:14:05] TheDev97: Aware
[1:14:06] lor_say: racks for gpus?
[1:14:07] Peenwa: munneh
[1:14:16] mezen29: crime
[1:14:16] lor_say: or gpus
[1:14:17] MikeNotSoGreat: should always have a reason to rob someone.. Not just rob them to rob them.
[1:14:19] ThicccBrickBoi: @hummerino he needs minimum of 100k maybe 500k for that
[1:14:22] Moonsc: RP should be rewarding story wise not grinding
[1:14:26] jaycedace00: people are treating it like an mmo
[1:14:28] thajollypirate: do it and pretend to be 4head LUL
[1:14:32] Hummerino: @ThicccBrickBoi GrinderW easy
[1:14:32] Madsouthafrican07: Thats it. I have been thinking for days whats missing.. thats it, its grinding and RP is a added bonus when it happens. its not the Priority.
[1:14:32] Bulfwyne: yea it shouldn't be seen as a "Thing" to do normally :D
[1:14:43] spoonfullofMusic: ngl i think dhead as a cop would be funny
[1:14:51] Sahil6255: any update on cop?
[1:14:55] Celascion: money problems limiting further RP Sadge
[1:15:02] NoLastChance: I dont understand the point. So somebody who works 9-5 in real life is grinder? Shouldnt you find sth you enjoy in rp to make some money?
[1:15:04] spoonfullofMusic: can't that danish dev give you a pardon as deputy major
[1:15:06] kronzillla: theres always gunner over yonder
[1:15:07] FizyIzzy: blacklisted NODDERS
[1:15:08] Hummerino: moon2CL
[1:15:12] Fishnet83: Didnt you go and apply with another character? monkaHmm
[1:15:14] DezalbM: your interview went great so idk
[1:15:20] thajollypirate: every onx member on a list
[1:15:24] Fishnet83: oh aurYikes
[1:15:42] thajollypirate: ye tru
[1:15:44] BackWoodBilly111: i knew that would happen LUL
[1:15:53] spoonfullofMusic: you could pull a saab and just show up as commissioner Kappa
[1:15:57] mattthetrucker95: they just dont want good cops on the force
[1:15:57] ShowHatez: snow was denied at first too
[1:15:58] Celascion: even some of the cops are complaining about how slow the intake is
[1:15:58] mexico_savage: song?
[1:16:10] j2texasboy: feels like pettiness with the onx and nopixel stuff
[1:16:13] ThicccBrickBoi: @spoonfullofmusic he has read the reports
[1:16:20] Coognut: Snow was only denied on Jackie
[1:16:23] thajollypirate: Feels like Cornwood is your inn to pd
[1:16:29] Fishnet83: Well they did have big problems getting applications through first month + i think. but i dunno SHRUGGERS
[1:16:32] bluntlol: Sorry, but long term once the hype dies and the big streams stop playing in 2-3 more months ONX is going to be way better than nopixel
[1:16:56] ThicccBrickBoi: I hear Kyle rp in the background
[1:17:07] NoLastChance: @bluntlol noone knows
[1:17:07] nedmac_: did Tyler fail his interview then
[1:17:12] DezalbM: even moon wanted to hire you its so weird how long its taking
[1:17:14] Killsauce: its been very slow hiring until recently
[1:17:14] Hummerino: LUL like moon just showing up and insta hired moon2Y
[1:17:15] kronzillla: tbh ive enjoyed the onx stuff a lot more than the grind on np meta currently
[1:17:16] wiseaddict: honestly joining the danish doesn't sound bad at all
[1:17:28] kaygeenyc: both can be good
[1:17:34] kronzillla: for sure NODDERS
[1:17:40] MadChemistTHC: even Koil said it was early because of GTA6 trailer and onx
[1:17:40] thajollypirate: nah its true
[1:17:50] bluntlol: My opinion on NP is that it was always be way to gate kept.
[1:17:56] footmunched: That R* RP week pushed both schedules, but they released way too early.
[1:17:56] TheDev97: i think both are different types, one is content driven(so grind for money = u can make content) and other is storyline driven
[1:18:02] kronzillla: maybe not "better" but how about more fun at times than the other
[1:18:05] thajollypirate: np only launched because onx to keep the players
[1:18:13] FizyIzzy: I hope both universes do great
[1:18:13] footmunched: But also, end of 3.0 was stale as AF
[1:18:29] kronzillla: one gets sluggish in meta while the other continues to improve, then the other catches up / surpasses etc
[1:18:30] Fishnet83: @bluntlol for sure. But doesnt it also seem like they've got less gatekept jobs this time around? monkaHmm
[1:18:31] Hummerino: nopixel simply has more large streamers atm and it got ramee & kebun back from prodigy for the time being
[1:18:32] NoLastChance: nopixel launch had nothing to do with onx. more for r* hpe
[1:18:32] Coognut: It was rp week fpr sure
[1:18:32] mattthetrucker95: i think if the current grinder meta is gone np could be alot better
[1:18:47] BlueIceMoon: @TheDev97 Can you give an example of the content that is made because of money grind?
[1:18:57] serv1ce_: i think onx cant grow, as people outside the buble really dont care that much for rp other than nopixel. and you cant reach new viewrs
[1:19:05] galatoad: I think it was just the timing either way. Penta wanted Onyx, but nopixel 4.0 was on the come up developmental wise.
[1:19:19] mexico_savage: lysDance
[1:19:23] kronzillla: NOPERS
[1:19:26] thajollypirate: maby not butm i feel like every job or mechanic needed 6months more work
[1:19:32] Bulfwyne: @serv1ce_ idk about that ... people on onx have grown and seen new viewers
[1:19:39] Hummerino: ehh it can grow it just needs to keep chugging
[1:19:43] KrazenSG: Its like having a small business and competing with the mega corporation.
[1:19:55] Coognut: That makes sense, discoverability
[1:19:55] NoLastChance: the onx vs nopixel discussion is so pointless. Just play whatever you enjoy more
[1:20:02] kronzillla: we know KEKW
[1:20:03] guccisosa24: who are the crims on onyx
[1:20:05] TheDev97: @BlueIceMoon using money to buy the buttcoin = laundramat heists/ammunation heist content, will be tailored toward cop/robber heist like 3.0
[1:20:08] BlueIceMoon: @serv1ce_ It has grown tho with vtuber community joining and some of strippin friends playing like Criken and joefudge
[1:20:08] guccisosa24: main crews
[1:20:18] Bulfwyne: @NoLastChance NODDERS facts
[1:20:26] Capablist: the blau cop podcast, seemed mostly lip service. "we dont want every cop to be the same" and then 10 mins later "we want all cops to follow strict rules and commit"
[1:20:30] Hummerino: onx seems better for smaller streamer i see a lot of the ones that got 50 of nopixel get 200+ on onx
[1:20:31] e1london: You know its bad when some of the besties been grinding offline 12 hours+ no RP at all
[1:20:37] TheDev97: anyone enjoy watching both? or just me?
[1:20:39] kronzillla: when trav is having fun, were enjoying / having fun.
[1:20:41] wiseaddict: i noticed that you do get more views
[1:20:42] FizyIzzy: I dont give a fuck NODDERS Timmac prodigy arc was one of my favorite in the last year
[1:20:43] Coognut: I wish everyone was together again because I enjoyed people's interactions
[1:20:47] bluntlol: No Pixel kind of always puts the same people in positions of power..... Plus it has for a long time felt like RP on NoPixel gets shut down unless you are a huge streamer.
[1:20:48] WoodenJonny: Yea its good
[1:20:48] Bulfwyne: yea RP is RP ... the fact that people make NP having to "Deal" with Onx is just weird lol
[1:20:52] Bigdan2140: Yeah like 2 days ago
[1:20:52] ToastedToaster420: @travpiper Exactly
[1:20:53] BlueIceMoon: @TheDev97 Ok I had no idea I have no interest in watching the heists
[1:20:53] MarinoV1: yesterday? saab, esfand, and ltcustard
[1:20:57] imploads: Tbh this internal weed argument is good rp
[1:21:00] KrazenSG: Ya that podcast was pretty ugh
[1:21:02] Defonicx: eh
[1:21:09] Bigdan2140: Esfand was really good on it talking about how NP feels atm
[1:21:12] thebradshaw6: the few times i've seen you on Onx you seem to be more happier and the rp is great
[1:21:13] Bigdan2140: compared aspects to an MMO
[1:21:16] thajollypirate: react stream Pog
[1:21:16] villaintheband: @travpiper enjoyed the rp with peppo and you (jack and Dhead)
[1:21:18] jojaha: for you maybe not, for people who don't play cop and play on nopixel definitely
[1:21:20] TheDev97: @BlueIceMoon yeah with np, content is like "Pog" or "WICKED" moments, always has been

[1:23:04] kronzillla: just tape over them
[1:23:05] krepana: Put some tape over them
[1:23:09] kronzillla: or tassels
[1:23:16] wiseaddict: like being in a beach
[1:23:25] TheDev97: @BlueIceMoon yeah, but with how much viewership it gets, it has its own audience. and story driven natural stuff like onx has its own viewership. I enjoy both

[1:40:00] KeeneyHD: @lor_say why do you say that
[1:40:17] lor_say: because there all agree with each other dont argue anything

[1:47:07] Gobo6: yeah sadly it has to be a balance
[1:47:14] juelz90: xqcCheer w
[1:47:25] Capablist: shipNOTED understandable but at least own it
[1:47:28] Defonicx: i mean i think its totally fine for nopixel and servers in general to allow bigger streamers to get away with more.. but its just mind blowing when those streamers deny that its happening or cant even see that reality
[1:47:40] zuckscalulator: I feel like cornwood not getting in trouble and Johnson /Dean getting FIRED for small mistakes it doesn't matter the viewcount cuz Deansocool has more viewers of Johnson but they both got in trouble for dumb shit
[1:47:42] MadChemistTHC: miss billy backshots
[1:47:45] legoliket: Gunner always had great interactions with JP
[1:47:47] lor_say: still dont understood that one but yea
[1:47:49] Allgrim1: Jack Bates SAJ
[1:48:04] MadChemistTHC: hope he appels and comes back
[1:48:09] SCOOPEDON: true
[1:48:17] Allgrim1: @madchemistthc he can't appeal
[1:48:22] Hummerino: @zuckscalulator LUL Dean deserved those DAP's he pushed so many bad charges at the start for the daps to build up
[1:48:23] lor_say: yea but if you think this far then the admins also havbe to think about the streamer career right?
[1:48:25] MadChemistTHC: foheadCry
[1:48:37] Defonicx: its odd to let viewcount come into play for cop characters due to their OOC responsibilities and their role in server integrity
[1:48:44] odiin23: Like peanut getting banned for robbing a cop in front of mpd, it created so much content
[1:48:44] spoonfullofMusic: to many people have the superiority complex, end up flying to close to the sun and get burned
[1:48:47] villaintheband: @lor_say  imo if you walk up on an active scene with weapons out o7, but hey im just a chatter
[1:48:52] ThicccBrickBoi: @zuckscalulator and they both got fired during there month. Sadge. Heavy sarcasm in that if you couldn't tell
[1:48:55] juelz90: @Flanilin no need to DM me "d1ckrider" because i write W after an 10 sub gift bomb
[1:48:59] Canahealz: It a RP server first right but when XQC goes out does a job and then drops off the loot and then right back out there to do the same job over and over all day long i feel thats not good IMO could be wrong about that just how i feel
[1:49:01] Defonicx: for crim its totally fine imo
[1:49:20] albakrut: Johnson kicked from PD for "lying" is in the same plate ?
[1:49:49] zuckscalulator: Not kicking FIRED
[1:49:57] SCOOPEDON: it’s not all black and white. rules should be followed… but there are areas of grey
[1:50:00] zuckscalulator: Content? Rp?
[1:50:01] BlueIceMoon: @Defonicx That's how you turn the PD in NPC that can't do anything against criminals
[1:50:06] lor_say: i mean because of him there is a new law
[1:50:13] odiin23: Like peanut getting banned for robbing a cop in front of mpd, it created so much content
[1:50:14] Defonicx: @Defonicx those are two totally separate issues
[1:50:19] Hummerino: he adds loud = funny Hhhehehe
[1:50:20] vayubam: him, den and cornwood were probably one fo the most active officers
[1:50:37] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: they add content
[1:50:49] thajollypirate: Great charachter but he dont need to be a cop for that
[1:50:49] SCOOPEDON: yeah you’ve said that before… what rp are you creating. I think that’s a major factor
[1:50:58] rav3rxi: Same with ming and prio I feel like if he ever held up a cop he would be banned instantly
[1:51:08] lor_say: are you activly evolving the rp of the server that the question right?
[1:51:08] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: your cop content was goated with wartell in 3.0 and Dean too
[1:51:09] DezalbM: he had a good beef going with chain gang
[1:51:10] Gobo6: I mean Dean/Johnson aren't banned just suspended/fired
[1:51:25] thajollypirate: no he dont
[1:51:28] zuckscalulator: @gobo6 no no they are FIRED
[1:51:29] LluagorED: I was watching Slacks when he got fired. And he was pretty much just not willing to admit he was wrong or apologize. Slacks said he could probably talk to another Capt and get job back. But he went villain arc instead.
[1:51:31] Nightbot: stay up to date on shit - twitter.com/travpiper | instagram.com/travpiper
[1:51:43] Hummerino: i mean Suarez got told he is on duty to much outside his shift LUL then you have cornwood in every shift
[1:51:44] vayubam: no drama at all.
[1:51:52] legoliket: Ming is one of the chilliest people
[1:51:53] kannar_tv: Gladge Ming is gem
[1:51:53] forgottenvibes_: True
[1:52:01] Nightbot: All my content is free, but if you would like to support please feel free to sub <3 https://www.twitch.tv/products/travpiper
[1:52:03] Gobo6: @zuckscalulator thats what I wrote, but so far dean is just suspended so far
[1:52:24] Nightbot: check out my merch at https://dotexe.com/collections/travpiper
[1:52:25] Gobo6: @zuckscalulator Denzel* not dean, just his character
[1:52:37] AloofMango: @Hummerino he is on in other shift and not his own, while cornwood is in all shift
[1:52:38] luckerooni: S-tier adult pretender
[1:52:38] Defonicx: true
[1:52:53] vayubam: i dont know about present-saurez. but past-suarez leaned more towards ping-chasing then actively creating interesting roleplay. not hate towards remdogg though. dudes great.
[1:52:55] lor_say: the next chase?
[1:52:56] Sp1te_: i hardly ever watch cop on NP unless BigMeech gets on his cop since 4.0
[1:52:58] kannar_tv: SHRUGGERS
[1:52:59] Defonicx: he drives car very good ok
[1:53:01] albakrut: good driver)
[1:53:06] Gobo6: Suarez was great at yesterdays traffic stop with FF yesterday :D
[1:53:13] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: it creates thE VARIETY. deansoHeart2
[1:53:16] Knebo_: epic chases
[1:53:28] mortaldictata117: Suarez was creating great rp before he was hired, then he got cop brain rot
[1:53:29] Hummerino: Suarez got 100% better after Kyle choked him LUL
[1:53:42] zuckscalulator: @travpiper and having a good/ fun cop like den or Johnson?
[1:53:43] spoonfullofMusic: i miss the gunner ass chief office rp
[1:53:44] villaintheband: @Hummerino LUL
[1:53:44] rav3rxi: In my opinion dean is the best cop hopefully he doesn't get fired
[1:53:48] lor_say: depends because crim can do it on there own but cops get handed everything and still complain tho
[1:53:50] thajollypirate: @mortaldictata117 100%
[1:53:51] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: if everyone was a Cornwood it be a daggum shit show 😂
[1:53:51] juelz90: xqcSus
[1:53:53] Sp1te_: the weiner sales arc Sadge
[1:53:59] vayubam: @rav3rxi den is probably one the most interesting cops to watch definitely.
[1:54:08] MadChemistTHC: to many DAPS
[1:54:11] Capablist: i feel like they just want cops that will make certain crims look good
[1:54:12] zuckscalulator: Got fired for too many daps
[1:54:13] pluxd: preety sure suarez is ppo officer thats why he got pushed back to his shift he registered to
[1:54:26] Defonicx: it feels like dean is just the beta tester for unwritten SOP/rules
[1:54:27] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: got “suspended” not fired
[1:54:30] wiseaddict: they probably suspend them to see if they even try to do civ rp
[1:54:35] Sp1te_: "indefinite suspension" i believe
[1:54:39] MadChemistTHC: think he's just suspended until review. still might not be fired
[1:54:49] sucio71989: travpiHey everyone
[1:54:51] vayubam: i wont like. den got a LOT of chances. he screwed up way too many times. so the suspension was kinda warranted.
[1:54:53] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: doubt he’ll be fired
[1:54:55] rav3rxi: Cant you get hired as cop ? You were always creating content in 3.0
[1:54:59] Bulfwyne: travpiHey @sucio71989
[1:55:01] Capablist: @wiseaddict they say that but also say they will only hire cops that can commit to cop rp
[1:55:08] Hummerino: he got daps for sbs and pushing bad charges at the start and they take a while to drop
[1:55:14] spoonfullofMusic: i mean its 3.0 all over again, instead of teaching them they only give them "daps" which is just strikepoints version 2.0
[1:55:15] Bulfwyne: @rav3rxi they haven't been hireing OG's
[1:55:25] zuckscalulator: Guys let's be honest if Johnson got fired and dean got hit too they are probably gonna both permanently fired
[1:55:36] AloofMango: @spoonfullofMusic No
[1:55:44] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: deans been on crim lovin the 4head Besties content
[1:55:46] Flanilin: @Bulfwyne yes they have
[1:55:53] Defonicx: thats sad I think your cops do a great job of balancing creating content while also do a great job at being an officer
[1:55:56] vayubam: johnson QUADRUPLED down
[1:56:10] lor_say: na you got it right
[1:56:15] zuckscalulator: BUT OFFICERS LIE ALL THE TIME
[1:56:17] Defonicx: yeah thats exactly what happened lol
[1:56:18] Hummerino: Den will get rehired, johnson did a no no after he was fired
[1:56:19] jaycedace00: on the month of February
[1:56:24] zuckscalulator: To their superiors too
[1:56:28] AloofMango: @Bulfwyne there are lot of old cops rehired
[1:56:28] Bulfwyne: @Flanilin idk bout that
[1:56:30] rav3rxi: Whatever happened to that girl you use to role with on cop Tracey?
[1:56:36] Metric: There's a lot of shit because the people who are around the most the more shit happens.
[1:56:37] MadChemistTHC: true
[1:56:37] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: they are making rules based on his mistakes lol tbh
[1:56:41] footmunched: Johnson was given so many chances to tell the truth, and skipped them all
[1:56:52] Bulfwyne: @AloofMango oh Snow's back on the force ?
[1:56:56] Hummerino: @zuckscalulator big difference with lying to civ/crim and in a report
[1:57:01] zuckscalulator: @hummerino what? He rped he was fired?
[1:57:03] Flanilin: thenur brain dead
[1:57:11] MadChemistTHC: him and Mr K in the sac
[1:57:29] lor_say: yea was a missclick
[1:57:40] thajollypirate: sbs turned real
[1:57:41] legoliket: Ye he muscle spasm Johnson LUL
[1:57:53] AloofMango: @Bulfwyne yeah Albert King
[1:57:53] Hummerino: @zuckscalulator he stashed guns which is bad
[1:58:04] realitijd24: LUL thats what k and ramee said aswell
[1:58:05] jojaha: they got DAPed too
[1:58:08] DezalbM: they cheered it on lololol
[1:58:10] zuckscalulator: @hummerino it looks very bad when both promenent "fun" cops get Fired one day between them
[1:58:11] jojaha: for exactly that
[1:58:15] thajollypirate: fear i think
[1:58:22] ThicccBrickBoi: @bulfwyne no he had to make a new character
[1:58:26] Bulfwyne: @AloofMango oh so Jackie Snow the cop character wasn't tho, thats what i mean
[1:58:31] rav3rxi: It's hard to be like super serious I think with Mr K because he's such a character he's hard to be firm with
[1:58:34] Bulfwyne: @ThicccBrickBoi ahhh Ok NODDERS
[1:58:36] lor_say: the real problem is no one knows if pd actually works on something because they do all closeddoor
[1:58:50] Hummerino: @zuckscalulator only 1 was fired other is just suspended
[1:58:52] zuckscalulator: @hummerino CORNWOOD HAS 100 JAIL food stash and that's a server nono
[1:58:53] ThicccBrickBoi: @bulfwyne snow got denied and I can't remember his new cops name
[1:59:08] spoonfullofMusic: esfand putting in crazy hours to, last week he did like 24hours KEKW
[1:59:10] thajollypirate: is LtCustard McNulty?
[1:59:12] MarinoV1: albert king
[1:59:12] zuckscalulator: @hummerino they are both fired
[1:59:17] MarinoV1: @thajollypirate yes
[1:59:18] zuckscalulator: Let's be honest
[1:59:21] AloofMango: @Bulfwyne Okay but they have hired other old cop characters.
[1:59:54] nedmac_: roy the boy was back
[2:00:00] ThicccBrickBoi: @aloofmango that's what I don't understand. No consistency
[2:00:01] MarinoV1: @thajollypirate was Sweets before. (and Collin in BBMC)
[2:00:05] FilzG: aka grind
[2:00:08] FilzG: yeah
[2:00:12] Bulfwyne: KEKW
[2:00:12] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: foheadRun foheadRun foheadRun
[2:00:13] Dangerouscrave: LMFAO
[2:00:16] Hummerino: @zuckscalulator indefinitely suspended is not fired
[2:00:25] thajollypirate: @MarinoV1 okey
[2:00:33] footmunched: To be fair, there was a ton of grinding on 3.0 - it was just done by non-streamers
[2:00:36] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: esfandOkay esfandOkay esfandOkay
[2:00:40] Bulfwyne: it depends how people RP with Motorcycles
[2:00:54] Bulfwyne: yeee its a tough one
[2:00:54] thajollypirate: bikes if fine if cops have them also
[2:00:55] lor_say: slow bikes
[2:01:02] vayubam: slow them down
[2:01:02] Bulfwyne: LUL oh no
[2:01:04] spoonfullofMusic: license plate, take their bike if used in a crime EZ
[2:01:06] GageTheEngineer: @travpiper how is Senor Hank?
[2:01:06] AloofMango: @ThicccBrickBoi dont want the exact same copy paste PD from before.
[2:01:07] davegeruss: make motorcycles dogshit off road
[2:01:09] zuckscalulator: @hummerino indefinitely banned is not banned forever but people are always perma banned afterwards
[2:01:09] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: kebunSmoke kebunSmoke kebunSmoke
[2:01:13] Hummerino: just server rule then against crimes LUL
[2:01:13] thajollypirate: nah just limit the speed
[2:01:18] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: kebunCG
[2:01:27] Bulfwyne: the rat strats :D
[2:01:29] rav3rxi: I personally think motorcycles should be banned from chases pick ups etc
[2:01:30] KittyGeneral: just make choppers only
[2:01:32] Ashes2049: fitting into small areas
[2:01:32] yellowtristan: I mean give cops more motorcycles no? then it’s down to who’s better
[2:01:37] Bulfwyne: can jump and squeeze between tight stuff
[2:01:38] CopperKat: yeah squeeze spots the cop cars cant follow
[2:01:40] weird_squirrel_: accessibility
[2:01:41] fopplsh: Allow immediate spikes for motorcycles once the tires popped its over
[2:01:44] haleybrielle: balanace for motorcycle is air 1
[2:01:46] lor_say: but pd has bikes to
[2:01:48] lor_say: they just dont use them
[2:01:57] thajollypirate: ^
[2:01:57] creepycutie66: make them slide over when they hit tracks or a curb, just like rl
[2:01:58] Dangerouscrave: @haleybrielle agree
[2:01:59] vayubam: make it so that bikes wont have the acceleration to climb up subway stairs
[2:02:09] Canahealz: well Ray had a dam bike in every bush crazy to me
[2:02:20] thajollypirate: ban hellis instead
[2:02:22] lor_say: 10+ involved with 6 men rule?
[2:02:39] Knebo_: Mc license
[2:02:44] Hummerino: @zuckscalulator FeelsDankMan
[2:03:03] Acebravo_nz: I think 6 is pushing it tbh
[2:03:27] zuckscalulator: @hummerino you'll see when den gets fired
[2:03:28] Bulfwyne: the 6 man rule is too much, too many car swaps lol
[2:03:42] lor_say: no 6 men rule is perfect
[2:03:58] lor_say: and in the chase wasnt even 6 people only 4
[2:04:02] Bulfwyne: LUL well some cops skip certain things depending on the person, but there's some that skip dundee
[2:04:06] Hummerino: @zuckscalulator sure he might be but he is not fired yet and i don't think he will be
[2:04:21] pluxd: tbh you know theres something wrong with the current pd when even mehdi was ranting about it yesterday on stream
[2:04:37] lor_say: that they charge with bullshit
[2:04:43] footmunched: Johnson also used his Weapons Licence to buy Civ guns
[2:04:44] Bulfwyne: PogU spicy mehdi ?
[2:04:45] lor_say: and actually are braindead and working backwards
[2:05:03] zuckscalulator: I believe the opposite I believe they have their hand with Johnson and this will be the example to people who want to have "fun" cops
[2:05:17] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: deansoSmoke deansoSmoke deansoSmoke deansoSmoke deansoSmoke
[2:05:32] lor_say: ouh ramee didnt like this comment at all lol
[2:05:32] Hummerino: Yeah i think Johnson the character is better finding a new route and he applies on a new character for cop
[2:05:41] realitijd24: LUL
[2:05:42] lor_say: yes he got ooc mad
[2:05:43] Bulfwyne: PEPW
[2:05:43] audy: ironic LUL
[2:05:46] Bulfwyne: i mean ....
[2:05:48] Bulfwyne: LOL
[2:05:53] Bulfwyne: jk
[2:05:53] Plosion_: LUL
[2:05:58] BobbyBoatRaces: i think he meant in some situations
[2:05:58] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: esfandStare esfandStare esfandStare esfandStare esfandStare
[2:06:09] TheDev97: Yes i agree
[2:06:15] Bulfwyne: yeee NODDERS its about the RP in the end
[2:06:17] audy: Ramee makes it good if he is anyway
[2:06:20] mortaldictata117: NODDERS
[2:06:25] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: saabDap saabDap saabDap
[2:06:27] Hummerino: yeah as song as you separate yourself from the character it no problem
[2:06:36] DezalbM: I see ramee more method acting than self insert
[2:06:38] Nightbot: stay up to date on shit - twitter.com/travpiper | instagram.com/travpiper
[2:06:43] jojaha: they brought it up in the episode, problem with being self insert is people take things personally
[2:07:05] kronzillla: do they consider the music rp to be self insert?
[2:07:06] TheDev97: yeah it can blur the lines for some people

[2:07:35] Nightbot: check out my merch at https://dotexe.com/collections/travpiper
[2:07:39] rav3rxi: I'm actually super surprised how relaxed CG have been feel like they are only wanting to have fun and not be that number 1 gang anymore
[2:07:41] thajollypirate: ppl still gonna have feelings
[2:07:45] v0id_br3ak: The best lies have a sprinkle of truth. Having some self insert can make a character more believable
[2:07:52] CopperKat: it would be nice if your name in game couldnt be your twitch name or irl name because chatters get annoying about confusing the two
[2:08:01] CopperKat: even if youre a self insert
[2:08:18] Knebo_: Spaceboy as James Randal is one of those people who can do whatever
[2:08:24] MadChemistTHC: @CopperKat very true
[2:08:34] Hummerino: LUL lost 5k to Penta
[2:08:38] TheDev97: @Knebo_ wait james randal isint a self insert? :O
[2:08:46] audy: imo the "worst" self insert is JP
[2:08:46] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: vadeTata
[2:08:47] Hummerino: no OMEGALUL
[2:08:48] TheDev97: nah dont think he did
[2:08:49] MADxBACKWARDS: No haha
[2:08:50] Bulfwyne: no KEKW
[2:08:54] MadChemistTHC: no, its like 80 years of twitch prime
[2:08:54] ThicccBrickBoi: @hummerino Penta couldn't celebrate Christmas because of dean
[2:09:09] Bulfwyne: he has to make payments and his kid will have to take up the payments they joked about LUL
[2:09:10] lor_say: gangbang = cuff?
[2:09:13] ThicccBrickBoi: pentawKaren pentawKaren pentawKaren

[2:09:58] audy: you makin a police character for 4.0?
[2:10:01] Hummerino: @ThicccBrickBoi PepeHands

[2:11:12] SCOOPEDON: Gunner and Knight having their own department was great. I wished it lasted longer
[2:11:12] fopplsh: @kronzillla Someone in that orgy was his father and he's gonna find him!
[2:11:23] Knebo_: Are there any cops who is a cop IRL?
[2:11:26] smallsytalls: there's police in 4.0?
[2:11:34] ThicccBrickBoi: @knebo_ Andrews
[2:11:37] smallsytalls: Kappa
[2:11:38] TheDev97: @smallsytalls yeah theres quite a lot now
[2:11:44] MADxBACKWARDS: I get what saab is saying but this PD be taking so many L's it feels like it could be demoralizing
[2:11:49] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: Snowflake PD
[2:11:57] Hummerino: pepeLaugh yeah its hard to find when you fire them all and some don't want to come back
[2:12:16] legoliket: That's not true they get a lot of w too
[2:12:28] BlueIceMoon: @Hummerino I think most of them want to come back but they aren't employing them
[2:12:37] Hummerino: OMEGALAUGHING hald the people they hired for the skeleton crew never showed up past day 1
[2:12:39] SCOOPEDON: yep
[2:12:44] Hummerino: half*

[2:13:10] reagon_plays: bloom prob
[2:13:12] pluxd: it seems like pd are struggling with basic charges, what are they going to do with actual big crime / huts.
[2:13:16] reagon_plays: ripley
[2:13:17] alpha_l3mur: :)
[2:13:18] TheDev97: snow?

[2:13:42] MudMade419: true
[2:13:43] thajollypirate: Anderws still plays
[2:13:48] fopplsh: Olivia Copper sadge
[2:13:50] mortaldictata117: Bundy
[2:13:56] FizyIzzy: Copper Sadge
[2:13:59] reagon_plays: then it gonna be serious issue
[2:14:03] TheDev97: rhodes
[2:14:03] Hummerino: then you restructure the PD again FeelsOkayMan
[2:14:04] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: reducer
[2:14:04] thajollypirate: yeah Copper
[2:14:11] TheDev97: true
[2:14:22] ImOome: As a new rp watcher, i like that the police are "new" and learning from the storyline that the economy crashed etc.
[2:14:23] thajollypirate: HUHH
[2:14:24] MadChemistTHC: Ingvar LUL
[2:14:30] DemiEllz: bones
[2:14:35] reagon_plays: when every now and then a major crime is happening they wont be able to handle it
[2:14:41] muddbugg81: muddbugg81 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 7 month streak! 
[2:14:41] TheDev97: good point @ImOome
[2:14:41] StreamElements: muddbugg81 just subscribed for 7 months in a row PogChamp
[2:14:59] TheDev97: and there are a lot of new rp watchers at the moment too
[2:15:05] Hummerino: I like the new cops but how do they have captains that dislike the old PD cause of sanguine then hire Brian Knight OMEGALAUGHING
[2:15:26] airleagach: trav, what happened to the pd? ive not watched no pixel for years
[2:15:41] thajollypirate: I want to see a Blau cop
[2:15:47] TheDev97: agree
[2:16:02] SCOOPEDON: not a hot take
[2:16:04] TheDev97: rule of 4 was so tense to watch
[2:16:26] reagon_plays: blau saying start of 3.0 is also to keep in mind that 3.0 was not a slow burn start
[2:16:30] realitijd24: no numbers is by choice
[2:16:41] Bulfwyne: idk ... Rule of 4 was better because you had risk and you had to make things happen, its a lot easier with 6 cause car swaps and interference cars
[2:16:53] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: @realitijd24 facts
[2:16:56] TheDev97: in terms of chases, its very crim sided cus they got bikes/fast cars, they did add the taurus for cops now tho
[2:17:17] realitijd24: they need experienced cops LU
[2:17:18] realitijd24: LUL
[2:17:21] footmunched: Rule of 6 has done nothing positive for RP
[2:17:22] Bulfwyne: you dont need it ....
[2:17:25] BlueIceMoon: @Bulfwyne Rule of 4 you had to actually make strategy and plans in every situation now its just the same roles and plan applied everytime
[2:17:26] reagon_plays: i dont think they need helis right now though LUL
[2:17:31] Hummerino: they dont really need helicopters they needs experienced cops LUL
[2:17:31] MADxBACKWARDS: that's only part of the problem but it would help a bunch, also might incite a bunch of malding after being 6 for so long now  lol
[2:17:33] Braketricten: I remember newer people being terrified of Wrangler early in 3.0. His using the law to fuck you.
[2:17:34] Bulfwyne: @BlueIceMoon NODDERS Facts
[2:17:36] thajollypirate: do this pd even have spikes?
[2:17:37] v0id_br3ak: Has Mickey really even been in that situation where he has been in a PD chase? From what I've seen he has been mostly a civ char and behind the scenes of the company.
[2:17:38] kronzillla: they need pure competency
[2:17:38] airleagach: omg yes
[2:17:42] airleagach: wiseguy
[2:17:45] legoliket: Yeah
[2:17:49] sheerroge_420: i can see them getting helis but do they really need bikes
[2:17:53] TheDev97: KEKW
[2:17:53] jaycedace00: weren't some jumps considered NVL early 3.0
[2:17:56] legoliket: Cops violating rights
[2:17:59] mortaldictata117: Don't need helis for laundry heists LUL
[2:18:08] huffa: it lead to problems because people are babies
[2:18:13] thajollypirate: i heard Cornwood held someone 8h the other day
[2:18:16] Hummerino: i mean people are in the cells for a while now cause they don't know what charges to push OMEGALAUGHING
[2:18:24] reagon_plays: early 3.0 bank robbery started too early and pd was needed to be boosted but in 4.0 the crime stuff is slowly integrating in the server
[2:18:28] scha_de: Wrangler always pushed it to an extreme imo, that was the problem
[2:18:37] Greatciverz: terry frisk are so try hard
[2:18:41] airleagach: 8 hours? wow, thats alotta downtime
[2:18:41] ImOome: @thajollypirate that situation was super weird ooc wise, the person was obv. a new person
[2:18:42] alpha_l3mur: I think it depends on who is getting raided, he needs to read the room a abit more sometimes imo
[2:18:47] fopplsh: CUM Unit!
[2:18:55] Bulfwyne: @scha_de yea but so did crims, if crims were up against the wall they'd just wipe the cops ... so can't say that too much
[2:19:04] airleagach: i loved watching academy
[2:19:15] SCOOPEDON: that stuff builds competency
[2:19:16] footmunched: The early 3.0 PD P&T was incredible
[2:19:24] MoraineValley: Agreed
[2:19:25] kronzillla: bingo
[2:19:26] Bulfwyne: yup
[2:19:30] Bulfwyne: and most cops can't LUL
[2:19:33] kronzillla: cops with actual backgrounds of doing it before in rp
[2:19:35] Bulfwyne: or wont
[2:19:35] realitijd24: leadership is missing for the most part
[2:19:39] airleagach: that all out slaughter on the last day always tickled me
[2:19:40] kronzillla: although its a picky process
[2:19:55] kronzillla: but you're competent
[2:20:00] kronzillla: KEKW
[2:20:02] Hummerino: watching some shift 1 you can feel the need for someone like Pred that they can rally around
[2:20:04] thajollypirate: KEKW
[2:20:07] Clucky206: management doesn’t stress the law competence
[2:20:09] kronzillla: and you apply yourself to things
[2:20:17] SCOOPEDON: I don’t think they care enough
[2:20:22] kronzillla: some just dont take it serious enough to care
[2:20:22] alpha_l3mur: good role players will make good cops weather they have played a lot of cop before or not, if they are creative they will be good
[2:20:23] thajollypirate: sure COPIUM
[2:20:32] Bulfwyne: well you can tell which cops will do what depending on who they stop or going against :D
[2:20:41] airleagach: wow, whats happened to my beloved gta no pixel!
[2:20:45] mortaldictata117: It's the sweaty gamer mentality that screws people over
[2:20:55] kronzillla: i just want to watch gunner Sadge
[2:21:00] Quantumdan: I think what contributes to it is a lot of people have been through a wipe so you do lose that touch of fearing the pd
[2:21:25] airleagach: is gunner GONE! awww, i loved him, RIP
[2:21:30] legoliket: Real jobs
[2:21:36] Nightbot: stay up to date on shit - twitter.com/travpiper | instagram.com/travpiper
[2:21:52] vida__loca___: I'm 39 in July
[2:21:57] airleagach: yes
[2:22:00] Bulfwyne: yup lol
[2:22:02] legoliket: Yeah
[2:22:03] ImOome: ur opinion is correct, but that an ooc problem. If a 21 year old streamer that has only ever streamed he wont get how to rp a certain scenario
[2:22:05] Nightbot: All my content is free, but if you would like to support please feel free to sub <3 https://www.twitch.tv/products/travpiper
[2:22:09] airleagach: and some white collar jobs too
[2:22:11] footmunched: You can see people like Kyle and Kylie who have basic workplace experience
[2:22:26] Nightbot: check out my merch at https://dotexe.com/collections/travpiper
[2:22:55] thajollypirate: Moose played Bloom right?
[2:22:57] Bulfwyne: NODDERS
[2:23:00] Bulfwyne: @thajollypirate yup
[2:23:04] ImOome: NODDERS i agree
[2:23:07] Cosm1cChaos1: As a viewer it's kinda blatantly obvious 4.0 pd is being way overworked. The balance of video game vs an irl job is kinda skewed.
[2:23:31] Bulfwyne: @N0Biggy not only PD but remember Lawyers and judges can feel too real
[2:23:36] Hummerino: 4.0 is speedrunning the PD FTO burnout from what i hear LUL
[2:23:44] alpha_l3mur: the thing about Bloom is you know you aint getting any Luara Gapes and she is BiS
[2:24:01] Canahealz: cop work = paper work and alot of it
[2:24:10] footmunched: The actual cop roster is pretty big, but like 60% barely come on duty
[2:24:10] TheDev97: mhm
[2:24:10] Bulfwyne: he prolly means all the paperwork and having to get things in line for court and all that side stuff after the stops
[2:24:18] TheDev97: i love bones as well
[2:24:24] mortaldictata117: Yup
[2:24:27] Cosm1cChaos1: Comes down to 4.0 being super heavy paperwork wise and like someone else just said it's not just cops
[2:24:33] airleagach: is dogbert still in pd?
[2:24:51] airleagach: awwww
[2:24:53] thajollypirate: yea Bones is really good
[2:24:56] legoliket: Dogbert plays crim now on onx
[2:25:19] airleagach: omg, reallllly
[2:25:21] Cryptic_Overload: @airleagach he has a cop on onx, but plays his crim on onx more
[2:25:27] ImOome: I dont think its heavy paper work, its what trav said earlier, ppl need to be able to articulate and if youre doing that in 5 paragraphs thats on u
[2:25:28] Hummerino: @N0Biggy yeah i mean i was watching some Kylie and KC are making spreadsheets for some jobs cause its so much LUL
[2:26:09] thajollypirate: Forty or what that cops name is seems really good also
[2:26:14] Hummerino: YAPPP moonmoon writing a novel every scenario
[2:26:17] realitijd24: its just experience LUL
[2:26:22] ImOome: i watch moon, and he types 4 paragraphs in like 10-20mins so its on others i think
[2:26:22] Sp1te_: like 6 min
[2:26:27] Bulfwyne: its not that long KEKW but Kyle and Penta still can't be assed for some reason
[2:26:33] Bulfwyne: it literally takes no time at all
[2:26:39] savy89: people say cops spend hours doing paperwork, if that's happening that's their own fault
[2:26:39] airleagach: the voice of the tarky dude you mean
[2:26:47] Bulfwyne: yea MoonMoon does good NODDERS
[2:26:50] fyffor: see his spikes clip from yesterrdaytt?
[2:26:51] Bulfwyne: and he fucks around too
[2:26:59] pluxd: some cops just write useless details also
[2:27:02] Hummerino: Madge He need to stop playing offline
[2:27:05] 57oni: yeah Moon definitely isn't afraid to get them to escalate when needed.
[2:27:06] huffa: nope
[2:27:07] DezalbM: you killed it in that interview
[2:27:08] TheDev97: @fyffor oh yeah that spikes clip was wild KEKW
[2:27:10] fopplsh: Randy Wrangler would use text to speech for his report period period new paragraph
[2:27:11] MoraineValley: I am a cop irl, I would love to roleplay as a cop on the server.
[2:27:14] ImOome: yeah that was funny, i thought u were a shoe in.
[2:27:17] scha_de: @Hummerino Sorry, but if Kylie chooses to become the "manager" of a mechanic shop and overcomplicate things with spreadsheets, it's kinda on her Shruge
[2:27:21] cobalt076: yeah that was great
[2:28:03] Hummerino: @Hummerino true but for stuff like moonshine you almost need it
[2:28:09] legoliket: Ever thought about doing lawyer rp instead if u don't get hired as a cop? @travpiper
[2:28:35] BlueIceMoon: @fopplsh I don't know how true it is but Bones was telling Lenny than he does the same thing and uses grammarly+ to make it neat
[2:29:03] Knebo_: I think Candice DeFitt was a great cop
[2:29:24] FilzG: mmo = grind btw
[2:29:24] fopplsh: @BlueIceMoon smart
[2:29:50] realitijd24: LUL
[2:29:51] FilzG: they do tho?
[2:30:00] realitijd24: crims have it rough in 4.0
[2:30:00] ilIustrius: a crim L is so much more severe
[2:30:00] Cosm1cChaos1: The Doj system rn causes cops to have to be super detailed. In 3.0 it felt like direct in court testimony held merit, in 4.0 it's all about the reports
[2:30:14] haleybrielle: cops lose nothing for an L
[2:30:15] ImOome: They are referencing some criminals "jaywalking" or something, then arguing for hours in the cells, then complaining it took to long.
[2:30:16] fopplsh: @Knebo_ I think that was the problem mid 3.0 cops weren't OP but there was just sooo many good cops
[2:30:18] muddbugg81: not when 6 crime v 15 are 30 cops
[2:30:26] xl__8s: cops kind of make up the rules as they go along, and then use legislation to justify their wrong doing
[2:30:38] legoliket: Cops don't lose as much because of qualified immunity
[2:30:38] scha_de: Some chatters said it correctly, crims have something to lose - cops don't Shruge
[2:30:41] realitijd24: if you watch how lawyers need to fight for the pd to charge the crim right LUL
[2:30:43] 1evilshark: 4head does it all the time
[2:30:44] Braketricten: sometimes they do, but there are important times where as a crim you have to fight as hard as you can. Like not wanting to get your first charge etc.
[2:31:00] TheDev97: yes
[2:31:00] Krodo_Baggins: KEKW
[2:31:00] Knebo_: Cops can just go tp the next case
[2:31:05] TheDev97: pixels
[2:31:09] footmunched: Pixel Money!!!!!
[2:31:09] ImOome: time
[2:31:11] KingTheTurtle: Viewers pentawBeef
[2:31:20] fopplsh: It's all imaginary they lose nothing too
[2:31:21] FilzG: what do you mean? Denzel literally got suspended indefinetly, Johnson got fired
[2:31:25] TheDev97: YEP
[2:31:25] Knebo_: hours of prep?
[2:31:25] Krodo_Baggins: TRUUU
[2:31:28] ImOome: NODDERS
[2:31:28] kannar_tv: oop
[2:31:30] Canahealz: yes
[2:31:30] TheDev97: EGO IS THE BIGGEST THING
[2:31:31] Hummerino: LUL
[2:31:34] KingTheTurtle: Yeah
[2:31:36] FilzG: what u mean cops have nothing to lose
[2:31:36] scha_de: I know "progress" its dumb to talk about in a RP enviroment
[2:31:36] Celascion: everyone wants to be right KEKW
[2:31:37] realitijd24: facts
[2:31:42] Capablist: NODDERS def ooc
[2:31:44] SCOOPEDON: yep I agree
[2:31:54] SCOOPEDON: ego is a huge factor
[2:31:55] legoliket: Cops get extremely protected by qualified immunity
[2:31:57] Algork_: Ultimately people still consider it a PVP game when it should be a bit of a collaborative MMO
[2:31:59] Canahealz: its a game you what to be good
[2:32:04] 1evilshark: not on timekept grind server, where for clean money you need to grind 4 steps
[2:32:07] FossilizedCheeto: go to jail, gain a bunch of jail food and sushies
[2:32:07] thajollypirate: Clipp it chat
[2:32:07] SCOOPEDON: that’s life man
[2:32:11] fopplsh: You got shot in a 3.5 hour holdout by a person who came back from the ER and didn't flip out or have hoppers
[2:32:15] thajollypirate: ye tru
[2:32:17] SCOOPEDON: ego is a mutherfucker
[2:32:18] BlueIceMoon: Cops do have a lot to lose its just that most criminals won't go through the trouble to actually make a decent court case to go against their charges and punish the cops
[2:32:20] MADxBACKWARDS: yeah its not even a hot take its fact kekw
[2:32:41] fopplsh: You handled it prof
[2:32:48] FilzG: PD walks constantly on tip toes afraid of losing their job because of DAPs, what do you mean they have nothing to lose? We literally lost 2 officers in the past 2 weeks
[2:33:23] thajollypirate: as i said i think 3 cops in the same podcast was not the greatest choice, anything they discuss is not gonna have the "other side"
[2:33:32] ImOome: NODDERS 󠀀
[2:33:39] muddbugg81: tru lol
[2:33:40] albakrut: KEKW
[2:33:43] Cosm1cChaos1: I mean realistically nopixel is and always will be cop vs crim
[2:33:56] ImOome: tbh it should be civ vs crim
[2:34:51] Capt_Schnitzel_: Capt_Schnitzel_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months, currently on a 8 month streak! 
[2:34:51] StreamElements: Capt_Schnitzel_ just subscribed for 9 months in a row PogChamp
[2:36:03] MudMade419: that’s funny as hell
[2:36:06] Cosm1cChaos1: I see what your saying and that's why I think cops like den aziz cornwood ect are important to keeping the civ and crim bridge.
[2:36:19] FilzG: @N0Biggy this
[2:36:40] Nightbot: stay up to date on shit - twitter.com/travpiper | instagram.com/travpiper
[2:36:59] ImOome: the report role play is funny when it goes to trail/lawyer stuff

[2:38:08] Nightbot: check out my merch at https://dotexe.com/collections/travpiper
[2:38:27] ImOome: this is the 8h story btw that was weird
[2:38:29] Canahealz: not on knifes
[2:38:31] Cosm1cChaos1: There is now
[2:38:38] Cosm1cChaos1: Not on knifes tho
[2:38:38] DisposableHero: Pretty much all the cop mechanics were factory reset
[2:38:49] scha_de: I still dont get that argument, you never that in 3.0 KEKW
[2:39:24] scha_de: you were able and still are able to inspect persons, but not items
[2:39:25] chokebot17: Its kind of an issue that Esfand is like the subject matter expert on cop RP right now. I love Esfand but hes not exactly the most experienced cop
[2:39:27] Hummerino: LUL 4.0 launched with 80% of cop mechanics not ready
[2:39:27] pluxd: after watching 3.0 its funny watching 4.0 cops struggle on ressisting arrest charges
[2:40:02] realitijd24: HUH
[2:40:03] Canahealz: DNA is a think and can get a crim  jailed later in time
[2:40:15] DarthKoroshiya: DarthKoroshiya subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 44 months!

[2:40:59] muddbugg81: naw
[2:41:02] Hummerino: funny thing is i think heists are limited to once per tsunami LUL
[2:41:05] BlueIceMoon: @chokebot17 Well there is Saab for that but also the same can be applied to Saab LUL
[2:41:05] FilzG: Trav the academy is soon, is there a reason why they havent contacted you?
[2:41:28] chokebot17: @chokebot17 I aint about to give my hot take on Saab in chat
[2:41:31] scha_de: I wonder why sadKEK
[2:41:31] ImOome: i thought they contact in game
[2:41:38] FilzG: its a fucking shame bro, they complain not having cops but they dont reach out to new hires
[2:41:52] FilzG: and your interview was top tier
[2:41:56] Capablist: did they ever acknowledge why so many cops arent being hired, or is it just straight up ghosting
[2:42:05] jojaha: they are doing academy so obviously they are hiring
[2:42:08] FilzG: they were!!!
[2:42:09] legoliket: Well they blacklisted all the onx cops @filzg
[2:42:18] FilzG: @legoliket are u serious? why?
[2:42:22] ky05uk3: Charlie's was really good
[2:42:26] Hummerino: think shift 2 is on hold for a bit so 1 and 3 can catch up but cheever and xice are away on personal stuff
[2:42:26] legoliket: I mean it's obvious
[2:42:29] pluxd: i saw someone mention theres like 600-700 applications to pd
[2:42:33] thebradshaw6: i just think 4.0 doesnt want a Gunnar as an officer. whats your thoughts
[2:42:45] FilzG: @legoliket not for me, im new, just watched since 4.0
[2:42:49] cobalt076: they brought Lenny hawk back...
[2:42:49] MarinoV1: @legoliket a couple got thru, but yeah. seems clear.
[2:42:52] limebr: onx pd cop number 1 prio???
[2:42:54] scha_de: @FilzG God I hate reading stuff like this. They literally hire up to 10 people every 2-3 weeks for each shift and have a dedicated academy. The problem is 70% of the hires to come on fucking duty.
[2:42:55] themenk: @legoliket snow plays both
[2:42:56] FilzG: @cobalt076 exactly

[2:43:20] Killsauce: I think its still just a case of hires vs fto numbers
[2:43:27] ky05uk3: they can't handle the CUM
[2:43:29] Hummerino: LUL gunner tried his hardest to get fired just to get picked back up every time
[2:43:33] Madsouthafrican07: How does that work? You are No1 but on like the 6th floor ?
[2:43:36] legoliket: I mean u did push it a bit with mask mandate PEPW
[2:43:45] fyffor: Why do you have an impression they won't hire you?
[2:43:48] BlueIceMoon: The most surprising thing to me is Hayes not being hired as a cop yet
[2:44:05] Sp1te_: meka widepeepoHappy
[2:44:14] Bulfwyne: @legoliket tbh people wore masks everywhere because the voice ID back in the day and complained they had to take the mask off to be ID'd lol crims just never liked it
