[3:30:40] Dubbleoseven: thats wishy washy tho i mean when games started back then what is not concidered complex now was complex then so technicly you could say that the level of complexiity was on par with current day and age. however nowadays games take sometime up to 5y of development so i think its right to expect an atleast somewhat "finished" product
