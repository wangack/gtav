[9:43:20] SavageAnimals: I wonder if it has to do with the ground clipping in the house and xee talking about fixing it
[9:43:26] StandardJake: Erin kind of killed it at that meeting
[9:43:32] StandardJake: notes coming in handy
[9:43:44] VaiNeko: It was a lot but i feel like a lot of ground was covered
[9:43:59] graydaemon: I wonder if Kermy was taking notes.
[9:44:33] CazeyTV: HI

[9:45:20] wizardiis: kivaHi
[9:45:39] Keeb_city: it’s subconscious survivor feelings lol
[9:45:46] LolmanScott: yoooo set homework?
[9:45:52] Soydrager: When I hear Pod I think of us being separated by grade in our own little rooms in middle school waiting for school to start LUL
[9:46:21] StandardJake: Can’t wait for bones to redeem himself on the next season of survivor
[9:46:25] QUOTE_IF_WINNER_POV: When I hear pod, I imagine those pods in spaceships uhnKek

[9:47:54] Anrisacia: Maybe I'm dumb, but why does she not have Julio?
[9:47:59] StandardJake: 🍵
[9:48:18] Anrisacia: OH KEKW
[9:48:22] CautiousDani: ohhhh lol
[9:49:01] LolmanScott: yeah freddy right there
[9:49:10] MYounk: Erin has been going hard
[9:49:18] QUOTE_IF_WINNER_POV: sarahn8Sarahn8hmm
[9:49:22] CautiousDani: Ye probably best for one on one lol
[9:49:37] VaiNeko: im going to assume he just thought you were too busy for something like that
[9:49:44] venkaramon: I'm worried for Julio. I don't think he has anything else to do in terms of illegal shit
[9:49:54] zeman94: Does ant want to lead as smaller group while running the larger one as well?
[9:49:59] MinotaurFluff: Might be lack of chop
[9:50:13] NegativeCapable: julio on that scrubs arc
[9:50:23] graydaemon: Julios been doing good at the hospital too
[9:50:26] Thrath: Suppose it depends on what Freddy would do with that convo because if takes the convo to anyone else it could look worse than what Andi intends
[9:50:30] LolmanScott: @venkaramon dude has the whole step for cleaning money to figure out
[9:51:16] Thrath: if Freddy* sorry missed a word
[9:51:25] CautiousDani: It’s kind of a bummer that the only one who ever really acknowledges it is GRL Sadge
[9:51:25] thatguymike03: i feel freddy just picked erin because she happened to be around him at the time
[9:51:41] jdeflume: I kind of see the Freddy perspective of Ant oversees the whole group so if the hacker thing is subsect then Ant is above them both anyway
[9:52:09] Thrath: Comms are comms I guess I just always forsee people not giving over the correct info a lot KEKW
[9:53:06] CautiousDani: Prayge ant gets to vent to julio soon
[9:53:26] wizardiis: NODDERS
[9:54:10] uitzui: well talking to people directly is what she always advocates for herself, so talking to Freddy seems like a good idea to me
[9:54:12] Sapphire_Tears: @cautiousdani Siz has also acknowledge it
[9:55:44] Madam_Orange: ye its just a personal thing not a group issue
