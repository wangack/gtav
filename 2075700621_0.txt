[3:06:44] GayHibiscus: @ThePurging They put in a single shot of caramel that's the same size as the one for the smalls...so the caramel never tastes like caramel
[3:06:50] Bunnys: I'll never understand how Dunkin got more popular than krispy kreme
[3:06:50] AzureMarquis: I've got a place called Bosa here
[3:06:50] Bowes0: You know what Moose
[3:06:52] Bowes0: I'm nice
[3:06:53] billfish87: I think McD's bought Tim Hortons for the coffee

[3:08:59] GayHibiscus: why are you so culturally ignorant I CANNOT ICANT
[3:09:00] brawnyprawn: McCaf√© started in Australia because we have such high coffee standards :D
[3:09:01] Hurray_hiccups: taco bell cantina

[3:09:19] MustardPlant: McNut
[3:09:19] theblazinwzn: YEPCUM
[3:09:22] Chrysaetos: "McCaf√© is a coffee-house-style food and beverage chain, owned by McDonald's. Conceptualised and launched in Melbourne, Australia, in 1993" it turned 30 last year

[3:09:48] ItsMeMattK: The best coffee you can make only requires you to install a 4,000 dollar brass monstrosity the size of a fridge in your kitchen, and then learn to grind, tamp, and pull perfect shots of espresso. Grow up chat and make it correctly.
[3:09:49] ComradeMolly: I mean McDonalds coffee is fine, but people compare it to Starbucks because people are dumb and dont know that 99% of starbucks drinks are just Espresso and Milk
[3:09:53] GayHibiscus: FAKE AMERICAN DOESNT KNOW ABOUT MCDONALDS
