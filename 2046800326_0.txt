[1:55:47] saliromeo: the only chatter that determines what VDM is, is Vigors DinoDance
[1:55:47] krilosrs: i think car is only op if you are using it against people with melee only
[1:55:51] M0MENT: JP targeting the union doesn't even make sense in this conflict, the union has nothing to do with his complaints
[1:55:52] krilosrs: idk
[1:55:54] KrisCat: @synthbreaknetcat they CAN attack you in a car if they have a gun

[1:55:56] yilloe: I mean you're not griefing or anything. Its fine

[1:55:59] a_ou1: maybe ask admins for clarifications !
[1:56:00] unIuko: i think if you run him over 5 times to kill him then its bad
[1:56:01] fambaa: well all weapons have classes
[1:56:04] Akizakiz: tbh isnt that the only choice? x only shoot from inside car how u gonna target him?
[1:56:05] coldeveryday: just yell "earthwell sends his regards" @Harry
[1:56:06] Jrr__Tolkien: i thinks is a fair move agains someone with a  weapon
[1:56:07] blueicetig: It's like TDM but with a vehicle. Just enable enough RP for it to not be VDM.
[1:56:07] pbr_sandman: It would be -1 not to use the car
[1:56:08] InVerse19: @synthbreaknetcat lmao a car doesnt make someone invincible
[1:56:08] MrTribal: its not vdm. if there is an rp reason
[1:56:08] rustico0716: X did that as well when a random guy hit his car. So...
[1:56:09] synthbreaknetcat: @KrisCat read np rules
[1:56:11] Axy_p: @ryuudrg it’s not grey at all. VDM is clearly when you do it for no reason or for laughs.
[1:56:12] BerzerkHitzDiff: hitting the assailant with an open door would be better lol
[1:56:15] n0vaacane: harrNODDERS
[1:56:19] fictionalsuburb: i would simply do a karate and disarm the individual GIGACHAD

[1:56:19] Dark_Eyes32: yeaaaa peppo was wondering that earlier. he dint want to corner somebody or pin someone (just because he wasn’t sure of vdm rules)
[1:56:23] synthbreaknetcat: @InVerse19 can u whack someone from inside a car? no.
[1:56:24] Jrr__Tolkien: makes more sense than running towards then with a knife
[1:56:24] blueicetig: VDM is never not funny either KEKW
[1:56:26] coldeveryday: true
[1:56:26] fambaa: class 1 pistol class 2 rifle and then car is like class 3 or 4
[1:56:27] Louwh1sky: yeah
[1:56:28] mrdumpling420: We need that gun hahaha
[1:56:39] itzdanyg: it’s not but it will get YouTube and Reddit comments going back and forth which will be hilarious lol
[1:56:43] dan0py: is lang on?
[1:56:46] Coolboarder80: I would hope for a legal gun coming out sooner than later.
[1:56:49] ktothec99: Roleplay > ruleplay at the end of the day
[1:56:50] Dythronix: wrench out all of the bolts from their car, while dodging bullets GIGACHAD
[1:56:51] djerbis: iirc by the police a car can be considered as a weapon so i dont think its against the rules
[1:56:53] OriginalGibsta: No way, you can't use your car as a weapon. You need to just bow down to the guy with the gun driving the free washing car NODDERS
[1:56:57] coldeveryday: @dan0py he's in the truck
[1:57:00] dark16sider: Shooting from a car is almost impossible to counter
[1:57:02] InVerse19: @synthbreaknetcat can you whack anyone with a gun who instantly shoots when they run up? no.... so the defense is run them over
[1:57:08] troopapips: football > gun
[1:57:09] Honeybearsss: i think server needs a way to make guns attainable somehow
[1:57:10] Tuccbag: Lang hit those dudes at the weed spot and nobody seemed pressed about that. If there's an RP reason I don't think it's an issue
[1:57:15] limpingmonke: Sunday nt and that many people are around
[1:57:19] shamma656: how does harry like the mcnulty cop

[1:57:37] synthbreaknetcat: @Tuccbag be realistic. an owner
[1:57:38] Suetek: Jesus hes already awake
[1:57:42] armedgolem01: it makes to much sense that's why i think there's gonna be drama lol
[1:57:43] luscinii: I wish Lang put some money on Si to build a bodyguard crew
[1:57:44] upsetgato: a bunch of boomers on the phone
[1:57:54] platinumxgelato: so at what point is the NVL rule out the window if someone else has a gun and you don’t?
[1:57:57] Dark_Eyes32: Peppo just ran into this earlier where he was unsure like “do I put this fucker into a wall”
[1:57:59] rustico0716: Si GIGACHAD

[1:58:32] Joker_Smurf: uuh
[1:58:36] ErraticSwami: Lia Snow
[1:58:43] Tuccbag: @synthbreaknetcat that has never stopped anyone from saying anything against him. Knock it off.
[1:58:43] Alexilalasismyuncle: wtf
[1:58:49] shamma656: it makes him GOD
[1:59:00] yahmobethere: guns need to decay waaaay faster
[1:59:00] djerbis: 99.9% XD
[1:59:02] M0MENT: bro IRL if I'm in a car and someone pulls up on me with a gun, I'm ducking and driving tf off, fuck that
[1:59:06] saliromeo: truth
[1:59:06] fambaa: you can use a car vs a gun imo
[1:59:08] J1_Boss: Don't beef w the gun holders
[1:59:10] Axy_p: if someone js trying to shoot me and I have the chance to run them over, I clearly do that
[1:59:10] PulsarPuppy: yeah i think its a lil weird that one guy can rob a cop and then basically hold up anyone they want
[1:59:11] synthbreaknetcat: @M0MENT NVL in game
[1:59:11] TekEvolution: Either need license to purchase ammo or gun decay
[1:59:12] jshwan: lang zeus
[1:59:13] N2isRippen: no you just sit there and get shot lol
[1:59:15] Yomojoe111: what if someone is about to shoot you? can you hit him?
[1:59:17] diet_sumo: It's just bad rp with gun
[1:59:19] kiwie00: if you surrender gonna get shot anyway
[1:59:22] KrisCat: just standing there for a person you know is going to shoot you is nvl when they've shot you 10 times already LUL
[1:59:22] Miffmac: it's either that or they promote pocket wiping cops again for guns
[1:59:29] yahmobethere: had same gun for weeks
[1:59:31] InVerse19: @synthbreaknetcat yea but literally everyone is getting griefed and defeating the point of rp by just dying over and over. Something has to be able to counter just getting shot
[1:59:32] itzdanyg: it’s really on the Pd to catch him with the gun at this point
[1:59:34] KingDekar: ?
[1:59:35] LovelyyAlicia: Susge
[1:59:36] butterknuckles66: Phycho killer on the loose. No one should care
[1:59:37] J1_Boss: They can't shoot you if you haven't done anything wrong to them or their crew
[1:59:38] Suetek: ??? 󠀀
[1:59:38] difficultsleep3r: Getting interns to loot box cops another
[1:59:39] M0MENT: @M0MENT yeah but that's my point, driving off in game when someone is threatening with a gun is not NVL.
[1:59:43] armedgolem01: los Santos is what liberals want the US to be irl lol
[1:59:46] 19StarP91: Become difficult to balance
[1:59:49] rustico0716: X just random killing civilian that is in sanitation 🤣🤣
[1:59:50] dan0py: NVL is all about leveling the playinfield, a gun can easily take out on a driver and a car can take on the gunman.
[1:59:51] coldeveryday: Susge
[1:59:51] KingDekar: sus
[1:59:52] armzie33HD: sus
[1:59:52] synthbreaknetcat: @InVerse19 then tell NP to fix rules idk ? thats the rules nVL is the way that works
[1:59:52] errrrrrL: SUS

[1:59:57] amandaboopboop: That was weird
[1:59:58] kuwwoo: Susge
[1:59:58] TheScottishDrunk: yeah if some mfer infront of my car with a gun holding someone up, am running that mfer down
[1:59:59] mage1941: LUL
[2:00:00] xhamaddd: And the problem is he shoots literally everyone lmao
[2:00:00] Oni_mara: Susge
[2:00:02] quadity2: Kinda crazy how he got the gun back today, but that's another topic
[2:00:02] PikePlayed: what i dont quite understand is this - if you hold up people with a gun, rob them, and kill them. and you never let the targets live. at some point nvl has to include fighting for your life, right?
[2:00:04] Dark_Eyes32: The situation for peppo was just that they were possibly getting rolled up on with a gun
[2:00:06] kSwong9: Susge
[2:00:06] izzygus333: people just want you to get on ur knees and do nothing if someone has a gun lol  even if your in a car no
[2:00:14] Im_Bennn: lets say JP is 10 feet infront of the car shooting its definitely ok to run his ass over KEKW
[2:00:15] ErraticSwami: The brother in peaky blinders got charged with cocaine possession
[2:00:19] jstnbrt: I asked zetark about conflict vdm yesterday. It was foggy for him too
[2:00:21] PulsarPuppy: also agreed i think ppl should need a license to buy ammo, i feel like that makes sense
[2:00:31] synthbreaknetcat: @izzygus333 the way it is
[2:00:44] emiz0r: Shruge
[2:00:44] BALDG0KU: people run away when a gun is drawn all the time. lol
[2:00:45] victorway30: does the rule of six aply on "crim-on-crim" cenarios?
[2:00:47] DrizzleLolz: Yeah
[2:00:48] Ketel_One: NP could always prohibit stealing guns from the PD for a while. That would solve that problem. EZ
[2:00:48] KingDekar: yeah PD mags should have their own ammo
[2:00:51] RizzOnez: yea i thought so too
[2:00:52] Axy_p: same
[2:00:52] gleebson: Yeah
[2:00:52] coldeveryday: that's how it should be imo LMAO
[2:00:52] synthbreaknetcat: @BALDG0KU yeah rule break
[2:00:53] Coolboarder80: Ammo needs to be produced not  unlimited stock, I do agree.
[2:00:53] Ezra_94: @synthbreaknetcat the rule literally says "Attacking another player/group using a Vehicle with the intent to kill/knock them out WITHOUT VALID REASONING OR INITIATION
[2:00:53] jshwan: car should be valid if someone has a gun
[2:00:53] PulsarPuppy: it *should* be like that
[2:00:54] The_BigDusty: wait you can just buy as much as you want?
[2:00:54] turbodyrock: same
[2:00:54] Joe_Broo: Tbh thats how it should be
[2:00:55] itzdanyg: that would probably be a good change
[2:00:56] s0rgen: apparantly ammo shouldnt have been in the store
[2:00:56] Louwh1sky: Buddha said he is gonna change that he did not know u could do that
[2:00:58] guilty_look: buddha said store ammo was an oversight
[2:00:58] Axy_p: I thought they need PD ammo
[2:00:58] izzygus333: yea fr lol
[2:00:59] KingDekar: gun stuff kind of been out of hand lately
[2:01:00] MovementEnjoyerEU: America, right? KEKW
[2:01:00] cinav_: buddha said that ammo will be crafted but idk when
[2:01:00] saliromeo: or that PD ammo would be different
[2:01:00] M0MENT: yeah it's really stupid that ammo is for sale lol
[2:01:02] J1_Boss: Bro if someone pointing a gun at your head even if your in a car, you are not driving forward, you will die
[2:01:03] realitijd24: LUL yeah
[2:01:03] LuciferSpirt: ooc lang did say that its suppose to be crafts but cant change it now
[2:01:04] krilosrs: dont need a license for ammo
[2:01:04] chillaxinvibes: don't you need a weapons license to buy weapon ammo??
[2:01:05] Dark_Eyes32: I feel like it’s insane to have a gun now your good to rob everyone at your own will
[2:01:05] rustico0716: he is just abusing gun like a psycho.
[2:01:06] fddfr257: Buddha said it was an oversight and it’ll probably be changed after the war is over
[2:01:06] DrizzleLolz: No gun license but you can buy ammo
[2:01:07] Yomojoe111: @Yomojoe111 well thats what Im saying if someone is holding you up and gonna execute you why would you just take it and not hit them KEKW
[2:01:07] The_BigDusty: what the fuck lmfao
[2:01:08] gadget_t: Yea. I don't understand that
[2:01:08] platinumxgelato: yeah that makes sense
[2:01:09] coldeveryday: exactly
[2:01:10] belden_12: Or that the gun doesnt degrade
[2:01:11] shamma656: yeah cops should have special bullets IMO
[2:01:13] luscinii: yeah that doesnt make sense to make ammo available but not the gun
[2:01:13] jbbresh: xdd probably better you can buy it instead of cops getting lootboxed daily for ammo
[2:01:14] KingDekar: PD down too bad to combat crims with guns right now
[2:01:15] Schwens_: i mean usually you get caught by PD, but X somehow managed to have it for weeks LUL
[2:01:17] Dythronix: KEKW lang bought so much ammo
[2:01:19] negapanda12: but then they’ll just go around robbing cops with the gun
[2:01:20] Ragnogh: or the gun needs to decay faster
[2:01:21] bobersmarley: there's a huge risk of using the PD weapon but he cops are kinda incompetent  rn
[2:01:23] synthbreaknetcat: @Louwh1sky ?? he has had a gun
[2:01:23] Satsurie: Do  the weapons degrade at all?
[2:01:25] Dark_Eyes32: it doesn’t make sense
[2:01:25] DrizzleLolz: YEP
[2:01:27] Alexilalasismyuncle: it should either decay, or run out of ammo….
[2:01:28] DrizzleLolz: Exactly
[2:01:28] PulsarPuppy: agreed
[2:01:28] errrrrrL: lang bought like 1000 bullets LUL
[2:01:29] TekEvolution: In CA you need a license to purchase ammo
[2:01:29] coldeveryday: agreed
[2:01:30] medusa_eyes: pd guns should only take pd ammo or something
[2:01:30] RizzOnez: ye i agree
[2:01:30] raspberrykelly: didnt pd guns used to have their own ammo>?
[2:01:30] bigchimpo: we def gonna see some eoka type makeshift
[2:01:31] PrismaPalma: yes its way to powerful
[2:01:32] Suetek: 200%
[2:01:32] izzygus333: and they know that aren’t getting caught with 5 cops on
[2:01:34] AntzRede: true
[2:01:38] synthbreaknetcat: @J1_Boss exactly lol
[2:01:38] The_BigDusty: LUL theyre going to implement that at this point because people can't help themselves
[2:01:38] errrrrrL: on accident supposedly LUL
[2:01:38] lilskete: lang got it from pd?
[2:01:39] KingDekar: we got like 4 cops in the city sometimes lol
[2:01:41] austinw812: but if you get caught with that thing. so many charges lol
[2:01:42] izzygus333: unless ur downed
[2:01:42] itzdanyg: unless they steal ammo from cops over and over ammunition shouldn’t sell it tbh
[2:01:43] bBass: Or have PD guns decay faster
[2:01:44] platinumxgelato: That’s 100% true
[2:01:46] BALDG0KU: cops should be tracking whos buying ammo since their guns are being stolen lol
[2:01:50] mrdumpling420: Better than before
[2:01:51] ztroly: buy Buddha doing the same with he’s gun?????
[2:01:55] synthbreaknetcat: @J1_Boss idk what these chatters saying that he should run over a guy who has a gun pointed at him
[2:01:55] tylynx: Police gun should have different type of ammo to civ/crim guns
[2:01:58] slnist3rr_dubs: @lilskete he got it from speedy that got it from X
[2:01:58] realitijd24: EZ

[2:02:05] lilskete: @slnist3rr_dubs ah ty
[2:02:07] Louwh1sky: @synthbreaknetcat yeah i know but he said he dose not like that
[2:02:08] Nightbot: PLEASE DO NOT META! Harry can only use information that his character knows in-game. Anything else is meta-gaming and won't be acted upon. If you continuously try to meta you will be timed out, or BANNED.
[2:02:12] chillaxinvibes: it should be a big red flag for the police, if they are "investigating" who shot you, i would think they'd check who's been buying ammo recently
[2:02:14] Slizwun: harrNom
[2:02:17] dan0py: @lilskete the irony is that X got lang the gun idirectly
[2:02:18] J1_Boss: @synthbreaknetcat facts
[2:02:22] KrisCat: @synthbreaknetcat he's not running over someone with a gun pointed at him buddy. he's going to do it if he's pointing it at the sani workers.
[2:02:24] whimzyyyy: @lilskete Speedy stole/bought it from X
[2:02:28] realitijd24: chilling with si EZ
[2:02:30] mrdumpling420: @ztroly yeah but he has used his alot less lol X uses his gun more than people eat food hahaha

[2:02:33] RichPintovie: yeah
[2:02:42] synthbreaknetcat: @jbbresh exactly this
[2:02:44] Dythronix: BLUBBERS
[2:02:55] RichPintovie: his character is so funny
[2:02:55] Axy_p: @chillaxinvibes that doesn’t mean anything. Anyone can buy ammo for any reason
[2:02:58] kSwong9: It would be interesting if someway there was a reason guns were only good for 1 day, so that if you needed a gun, you had to get it the day of for whatever situation you needed it for.
[2:03:01] synthbreaknetcat: @BALDG0KU not legal
[2:03:06] mike9904_: harrCozy
[2:03:12] KrisCat: there are a lot of nopixel admins in chat apparently LUL
[2:03:17] KaozVI: @synthbreaknetcat leave the rules to the admins my guy

[2:03:19] mike9904_: @kriscat LUL
[2:03:20] synthbreaknetcat: @KrisCat not what he said my guy go back

[2:12:28] M0MENT: @itzdanyg what's crazy is JP thinks they haven't been making money at all since this war has started lol
[2:12:33] Louwh1sky: i thought jp lost his gun last night but i think he robbed another cop for one idk tho
[2:12:36] saliromeo: @mrdumpling420 it was great
[2:12:37] Akizakiz: tbh if somehow the pc unlock new app jp will instantly drop this war
[2:12:37] krilosrs: @jesscdcc true. but X will happily just go around shooting and stabbing union workers all day. Lang will just keep doing his thing, and only those 2 can call it off
