[1:24:55] Sweet_BabyJeebus: It's GTA, it should be a little more wild
[1:24:58] Janman88: thanks chat
[1:24:59] TheDarklordReturns: denzel getting so many daps is criminal
[1:25:00] KellBellnf: Giving out 3-4 daps at a time is nonsense, becaause it just makes people think oh if I get punsihed 3 times I'm fired
[1:25:00] spazticbull: I want the server to be more fun maybe a little less strict and if that takes a little away from the realism then that is fine
[1:25:02] draxthos: Proude to be Swedish
[1:25:02] alex_j32: have Abdul or peanut been caught yet?

[1:25:15] DismalShark: 4.0 pd was made for an instrument to crims
[1:25:17] Tcmasterzzz: YEP
[1:25:17] EPiQ: Agree, some in chat just wanted cops to be able to use force way more often.
[1:25:18] tacwombat: headBang
[1:25:19] Ragestrike: @EsfandTV I feel like the Daps would make more sense if they Fell off after a week or After the Time has been Served from Suspensions.
[1:25:20] Mod_PoopSock: how long have you been growign your hair out?
[1:25:20] Saggitari0: I didn‚Äôt watch much yesterday, did you catch Peanut?
[1:25:20] puppietreats: YEP
[1:25:24] Count_Brennuvarg: @EsfandTV I don't think DAP are that bad, but it is ridiculous that you can get 7 at the same time. Theoretically you could get 0 to 12 at once and get fired immediately OMEGALAUGHING
[1:25:24] LogicWeasel: is that why the PD can't have the better cars yet?  @EsfandTV
[1:25:24] BelllGoR: You cant have fun with cops like ruth
[1:25:25] Thraxton1: Pd can have fun without being overpowered
[1:25:25] TheFox0228: The DAP system is way too aggressive right now too.

[1:25:31] ZealotB: @Mod_PoopSock he was born this way
[1:25:32] Janman88: moral across is not good i think @EsfandTV
[1:25:33] Meditati0n: The fun part should go bouth ways between crims and police, makes for a good show
[1:25:33] Wave_TF: What if being treated like an NPC is my kink, ever think about that?
[1:25:33] erafor9: you are only there so crims can feel the thrill of being chased lol

[1:25:41] brimstonegusher: peanut = joker
[1:25:41] MasterSkizz: when is stage 2 esfand? :)
[1:25:43] IanDooleyTV: The server I play on is brutal. The cops are also Admins. ruins the whole thing.
[1:25:43] Diamondman121314: I hate the argument I see where it's "the same 3 people"
[1:25:43] keterych: LSPD gotta be juiced before sheriff office opens up
[1:25:43] PsychoJoker: yeah need more people before even thinking about a sheriffs office but setting the seeds in the brain about it is good too
[1:25:45] fighead1: TY okey
[1:25:46] DonnBeach: LUL
[1:25:46] Wafflecake_z: you gonna catch peanut today?
[1:25:48] bigoldmanmeat: damn rip coco
[1:25:48] sendemup: if a balance between PD and crims is bad then its a player base issue. its RP not fucking K/D ratio
[1:25:49] matanzlatan2000: what happened with peanut? i missed yesterday
[1:25:49] SchizoForever: I have a hard time believing that esfand's gonna do a wow stream with this guy

[1:26:24] erniejohnsonjr: mhm

[1:26:52] BoogieAnimal: NODDERS
[1:26:52] Belvai: i watch a fair few PD streamers and none of them care about the daps
[1:26:53] mejstroo: One captain is straight up lying, the other captains just buy into it and nods. You can call it RP but it straight up villain shit
[1:26:54] Cerkins: mhm
[1:26:55] vildenb_: if brain stupid entire body hurt
[1:26:55] itsNudeGrandpa: Susge Archer

[1:26:57] 1CaptainRedBeard1: And me.
[1:26:57] GYNECHIATRIST: Susge
[1:26:58] 9trashpanda9: especially when it came from another officer attacking him lmao
[1:26:58] Zarniwooper: 60 days is ridicilous, Shiestys daps would take 1,5 years to wear off
[1:26:58] FelipeLLs: Pain NO FUN
[1:26:59] ninjamadmax8: IN THE NAME OF GOD PokCharizard
[1:26:59] LogicWeasel: Susge  archer should be on edge, we're ONTO her

[1:27:01] itisacar: aziz Sadge
[1:27:05] mattchutt: right so, you have 7
[1:27:05] IanDooleyTV: @jinnytolls Yeah Denzel just straight up took a break. He didnt even stream off duty. He's probably salty. I'd be salty
[1:27:07] guilt_: @EsfandTV any clash of clans today bro?
[1:27:07] Kfoo_: the DAP system is a no -trust method of maangement where leadership goes into it assuming their subordinates are going to fail and so they've prepared punishments in advance.  The police force should instead start from a position of assuming they've hired professionals, and do proper coaching to weed out bad behavior
[1:27:07] singsyng: is Andrews afraid to log in anymore? where is he at?
[1:27:08] DrDoomie: Denzel gonna get a contact DAP for this Sadge
[1:27:08] themadnasty: thats why all the cops playing crim characters LUL
[1:27:09] Mastodonian: the whole crew needs to have an intervention with the captains and say that kekw
[1:27:09] PsychoJoker: The PD is supposed to be a unit they all care about each other
[1:27:10] spazticbull: Yeah I feel like Andrews is getting tired of it all
[1:27:11] Percolatorx: FUN DETECTED
[1:27:12] Janman88: lets be real the DAPs are "u play only that way or ur out" @EsfandTV
[1:27:13] FelipeLLs: Pain NO FUN ALLOWED
[1:27:13] CuBanMumzy: don't do stupid stuff
[1:27:14] Kaztiell: @Rivath he has surgery irl
[1:27:15] TheDarklordReturns: cops cant do there job cuz theyre scared to get suspended
[1:27:15] Paudelly: Paudelly subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 48 months!

[1:27:17] KellBellnf: Yeah especially when its always 3-4 at a time, and for 60 days, its insane
[1:27:17] Th3Ch0: Where has Andrews been?
[1:27:17] Xierany: @Rivath He had surgery last night
[1:27:18] Krypt1ks: They need to talk to people and then do re-training and 3rs strike is a DAP
[1:27:19] JC9R_: aziz is having surgery
[1:27:19] Mehugga: My eye sight doesnt go very ffar
[1:27:20] marneraiders: Unionize
[1:27:21] Rivath: ah ok
[1:27:21] boldasluv: What is happening is targeted RP
[1:27:22] sp00ookiest: but thats just like any work place- if you see management handing out punishment, it scares everyone else
[1:27:26] Cthyllah: cops should be policing the crims. not the police.
[1:27:26] Twiitcher: 6 cylinders, one bad, the engine runs bad.... (good analogy?)
[1:27:27] DViousGaming: The fact it is based on real time makes no sense, people will just not play to avoid being fired
[1:27:28] maikkekku: YEP
[1:27:28] meatlove69: give a bit spicy to PD RP
[1:27:28] tuxedo_tc: what song is palying?
[1:27:29] Peppermint_Wizard: Instructions unclear I cut my thumb off oh god there's blood everywhere
[1:27:29] NoBananaSuits: @singsyng think he just has a real job and a child lol

[1:27:31] harrytitsmitchell: Prayge sabaton tho
[1:27:33] devlin0221: I cant stand the lying in this version
[1:27:33] captain_steve_420: Sonya lied and got away with it
[1:27:35] cuspeli: sniffthenewchatter
[1:27:35] LogicWeasel: Is there a reason the PD can't all use the better cars yet? @EsfandTV
[1:27:36] Ten_Ju: Captain Ruth is unhinged as fuck tho.
[1:27:38] calcifero7: The problem is how the captains are giving out those daps
[1:27:38] Luthercorpz: lysPog lysPog lysPog lysPog GLORY
[1:27:40] jinnytolls: @IanDooleyTV salty is the wrong word. He's literally anxious for days over something that should be a conversation not a lash
[1:27:40] goingafk0: FeelStrongMan Clap not on paper and in real life was a good quote
[1:27:41] Yevonai: it's PD morale work
[1:27:43] RexPappa: it has to be fun, at the end of the day is just a game and you could be playing aaaaaany other game
[1:27:43] maikkekku: Lying on your PD report should be insta looked at, shit RP
[1:27:43] khewbaka: Bro how can u be so calm when explaining the same thing every day? i would be madge
[1:27:44] Sam92: the DAPs could literally kill future RP due to IRL facts
[1:27:44] Joongi_: But also, this is RP, doing stupid stuff is part of it, it's fun kekw
[1:27:44] SSJets_STC: I also hope heists start to open up soon. Crim life right now I feel is very bare bones in terms of interaction with the police, so it leaves to the cops to just patrolling around doing traffic stops and responding to snr buns calls
[1:27:46] SchizoForever: just get a car and drive out
[1:27:47] Kryptonautti: SHiesty should have only gotten 1 dap from the Sonya incident.
[1:27:47] lnfamousLight: @EsfandTV based on the conversation you had with slacks, if you asked these other officers "does denzel getting a dap for this put you on edge as well?" and you get confirmation, then slacks would be willing to listen
[1:27:49] Criptaike: essaying
[1:27:49] boldasluv: they can mess u within the rules of RP
[1:27:49] shermz4: the people getting dabbed are actually enjoying it and making good rp for everyone and they get punished for it
[1:27:49] Sweet_BabyJeebus: It's the rules themselves , not so much the enforcement
[1:27:49] Chomp64: The hand doesn't have FULL GRIP strength
[1:27:50] spyrouly: How many daps and days of suspension for the cop who insult den and aziz ?
[1:27:50] singsyng: @singsyng ok how was he playing at all then?
[1:27:51] Trepko: It'd be terrible to lose Den and Aziz they're so good at RP
[1:27:51] random_viewer_55: SPIN TO WIN
[1:27:51] Cfcampbell24: yeeClown
[1:27:52] tacwombat: den getting 2 daps for that still blows my mind
[1:27:52] Jessc1996: like derolo and her liars affected a streamers income ultimately
[1:27:52] DeoNone: denzel got dapped for the stupidest reasons
[1:27:52] sendemup: v6 DansGame
[1:27:52] squirtlehermit: yeah the situation between den and sonya is crazy because aziz got most daps outta that
[1:27:54] RedpiII: gotta play hardball i guess
[1:27:55] tm_901: there should be an internal affairs department instead of captains giving daps
[1:27:55] drypc96: deansoSadge deansoSadge deansoSadge
[1:27:55] 9trashpanda9: they said they would fire whoever lied with the denzel/sonya situation and then didnt fire sonya.... sooooo
[1:27:55] JustinBinder: Just like Duncan said he would have got dapped if jimmy two time went to the caps about harasment
[1:27:56] sunlitebro: liberal cops policing cops smh
[1:27:56] MoistMouthMags: @EsfandTV i feel like cornwood needs to have a "permission to speak freely" talk with a captain and blow the lines out
[1:27:56] mattchutt: no the hand was perfect analogy
[1:27:56] Belvai: so waving your gun at a crowd isnt stupid?
[1:27:57] ImStuckInATreeDud: WutFace lack of emoticons
[1:27:58] SchizoForever: HUH
[1:28:01] themadnasty: its the same few people getting dapped because they are the only ones showing up every day
[1:28:01] Faylez: do a coup peepoRiot
[1:28:02] ninjamadmax8: is it bad I'm too busy listening to the music since gta rp drama makes me Sadge
[1:28:02] mensrea123: union, appeal process NODDERS
[1:28:03] IanDooleyTV: @jinnytolls That's truly unfair to him, I hate that.
[1:28:03] 5CookieMonster5: Chatting
[1:28:05] boldasluv: RP can be anything
[1:28:05] PizzamanTV: does no pixel have IA (internal affairs)
[1:28:06] Kaztiell: Deans cop character was in trouble in 3.0 aswell, thats just how he plays it
[1:28:06] Janman88: for real maybe establish a police union or a civil oversight board @EsfandTV
[1:28:06] GamblersFallacy: @EsfandTV how did you break your thumb? Û†ÄÄ
[1:28:06] Addiction_King: mhm ape together strong
[1:28:07] Mastodonian: crims - 20 minutes in jail, cops - 60 real life days for a dap Classic
[1:28:08] izahkiel: IT'S CALLED HAVING FUN CHAT AND ENJOYING THE GAME BibleThump  they just want to have fun and not get DAPPED for the smallest mistake
[1:28:08] blackjack84: sanya not stepping and taking responsibility up is a kick in the ass to the other officers
[1:28:09] mechoriet: I bet people are scared it all blows up again into a shitshow
[1:28:12] Raja_Banhammer: NODDERS
[1:28:13] Sweet_BabyJeebus: No Hats and vests? So stupid
[1:28:13] ZealotB: headBang
[1:28:15] Percolatorx: up rising time

[2:08:54] connorcrow15: facts tik tok clips are so out of context
[2:08:54] SurelyBaked: cornwood has been fighting people hating on his policing since day 1 you know that
[2:08:55] Chewp: Cornwood looks just like Neil Gamby
[2:08:56] meatlove69: RP cops and IRL not the same LUL
[2:08:57] TheSoldier1851: We'll see a clip of you trying to jump a highway and getting ejected out of your seat and the car exploding incapacitating Flops too though Kappa
[2:08:58] Jrey000: Tuner would be a good pd cheif not sherif
[2:08:58] catloyalist: Cornwood just needs to make his reports better and than Id say he deserves a lead role. Its hard to justify it as they stand now.

[2:09:07] theOriginalODog: Thanks to the youtube channels that condense the good clips so we can stay up to date :)
[2:09:07] forbidden0nee: Vote Cornwood for sheriff for a better future. :P
[2:09:09] lallii123: You need to be able to shitlord for fun without reprecussions someimes, it ruins the rp
[2:09:10] boldasluv: I feel so unsure As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor As the music dies, something in your eyes Calls to mind a silver screen and all its sad goodbyes
[2:09:10] Gourn97: objection, weird
[2:09:11] Sweet_BabyJeebus: Cornwood knows exactly what he should be able to get away with
[2:09:11] Janizki_Fin: put the money and turbo iin the lockbox?
[2:09:13] Downbag: You would see someone shit-lording with the police, and they breaking, but not how the situation ends
[2:09:14] OutKast2: cornwood for president KKornwood

[2:09:42] MDM4ever1986HD: Does James Randall have any?
[2:09:43] SurelyBaked: cornwood is one of the most valuable characters on the entire server dude is an RP magnet
[2:09:45] puppietreats: YEP lol i love him and james but true
[2:09:46] TheEmmorf: Slacks,Ruth,and Turner are all Captains right? If they elect a Chief of Police wouldnt the chief be over the Captains? Dont rule of Chief of Police too

[2:10:05] puppietreats: @ciphz nahhh they told him and adam to leave soooo many times
[2:10:05] iwannanuhh: i think its weird how much grace crims are given, and if they get that much then pd should be understanding and give their officers an equal amount of leeway
[2:10:10] Cthyllah: when you spend 15+ hours doing serious cop shit every day, theres gotta be some fun goofing off at some point, that doesnt make cornwood a "bad police officer"
[2:10:11] humanhere2: or just break it up a bit... doing that a bit is ok, but like 50 times a day is too much
[2:10:12] woolfdesign: They dont understand how shitty the PD situation is
[2:10:12] Drizzle1390: oswaldo probably would sue lol
[2:10:15] ShadowedSeraphim: @esfandtv part of me wishes the PD would Crack down on people so they stop doing the stuff that hurts the overall rp
[2:10:15] ArdentCause: No! Cornwood is actually a really high level cop with an immense amount of exp and knowledge. If anything it seems to me that this is Cornwoods rebuild arc from the SBS's days - Cornwood is a mix of slacks and turner in the sense of the no bullshit in serious scenarios but is still so engaged with his people
[2:10:17] ilmarcusil: Suv ran a red Classic

[2:46:51] singsyng: it'd be funny AF is every high profile officer got 10/10 DAP'd and fired
[2:46:53] thealiien: so are daps supposed to be a server admin thing or a RP thing?
[2:46:54] itsdubbz710: @puppietreats its true bitch

[2:47:01] jonfett: Ruth is def up to something, she's TARGETING very specific people
[2:47:01] MackPlays: If they just hire the whole crew from the end of 3.0 then it‚Äôs gonna be the same
[2:47:01] MDM4ever1986HD: Ruth is making so hard for cops to do their job and I agree those on DAPs should go with FTOs

[2:47:08] enfranchise_: Captain Ruthless Dappington
[2:47:08] blackmar14: maybe they are just focusing on the downs right now
[2:47:09] SchizoForever: they are
[2:47:09] Thozel: Bobbyyy
[2:47:10] slatt5: it‚Äôs just been taken too far too soon imo the denzel stuff seems like harassment sometimes
[2:47:11] zjdvvvv: ReallyMad ruth\
[2:47:12] Vixent32: All captains are great imo,some need to get things sorted out, but that's space for roleplay so I live the dynamic. I'm just sad it mess with mentals of certain people
[2:47:13] Claxman2000: @singsyng that‚Äôs the current trajectory.
[2:47:13] mattchutt: peanut prolly at snr buns now
[2:47:16] jy33130: LUL
[2:47:17] Karter6t: When more than 1/2 of the police force has DAPS? Who does that reflect on?
[2:47:17] caspar1644: bobbay
[2:47:18] RexPappa: The captains are too afraid of the past that theyre strangling the PD.

[2:47:40] Qolat: Has Andrews gotten a DAP?  That'd be nuts.
[2:47:41] l1festalker: PULLITOVER
[2:47:41] Thy_Panzer: i thought vivian was the captain not ruth for the longest till the whole denzel situation
[2:47:42] DannyL3tscher: the friction creates some good RP too
[2:47:42] soosmaz74: RUTH NEEDS TO STAY
[2:47:42] Sch1ey: The time it takes to get rid of daps is the problem
[2:47:42] Inz4ne_: 40fps 4090 LULW
[2:47:43] barnsyyoo: i like how cornwood just ignores red lights completely
[2:47:43] JC9R_: All issues in the pd root from Ruth
[2:47:43] Papercappu: I think the DAP system are fine but the way ruth use it seems very robotic
[2:47:44] FelipeLLs: Classic
[2:47:44] Kalious78: can you not just ocean dump ruth one night as she wont remember it lol
[2:47:45] vinnythevman: @weijibeng tomorrow you find out that cheever cross banned you for colluding with other chatters
[2:47:45] Triwinner97: @mattchutt Susge why do you say that
[2:47:47] e1onmadetwitterfascist: as you  guys pointed out correctly communication is the key. get all those people together & the captains and talk in a big round about that @esfandtv othwerwiae nothing will change
[2:47:47] sircrumpler: In the burger shot parking lot
[2:47:48] stillbaALin: we gonna see a string of 2 daps as captains can send them without speaking to other captains
[2:47:48] ilmarcusil: monkaLaugh i love Shift 1
[2:47:49] GrumpyFelo: Its not getting rid of ruth more like telling her ooc to tone it down a little?
[2:47:49] MackPlays: You need the different kinds personalities whether you like them or not chat
[2:47:50] Darkblade11210: wait what happened today?
[2:47:50] oengeesa: maybe demote her
[2:47:50] PoeT_Ttv: she can be a sgt & do fine
[2:47:50] skilleto19: You need Ruth the issue is she is too strict YEP
[2:47:51] SchizoForever: I think it's the same
[2:47:52] Sam92: burger shot parking lot Jamgie
[2:47:53] zjdvvvv: acting PepeLaugh
[2:47:53] Belvai: ruth has handed out the lest daps tho
[2:47:53] RobRoads: Ruth just having an arc will be all that is needed later. Not now
[2:47:54] MysticCasey: @esfandtv Need to set up a stakeout at Snr Buns since peanut goes there often

[2:47:58] Gachiguru: acting LMAO
[2:47:59] espada222: im so confused about this pd drama LUL
[2:48:00] Haleos_x: mayor should be appointing a chief of police
[2:48:01] SchizoForever: HUH
[2:48:01] Cthyllah: its just the problem of throwin the daps around like nothing, and also everyone is stressed out and taking it out on their coworkers, when theyre supposed to be a team
[2:48:02] DannyL3tscher: acting Susge
[2:48:02] zilaprime: Yeah, but some of it overall
[2:48:02] thegummibearmassacre: @Inz4ne_ Its apparently pretty intense on pcs :X
[2:48:03] the_black_hawk_34: well as good as ruth is in RP hopefully Koil doesn‚Äôt come here and force to fire here bc of the rp
[2:48:03] HelgaZilla: not if it ruins RP for those around.
[2:48:03] moto432: Ruth's character is good as long as it stops actually just ruining peoples drive to play the game
[2:48:05] DrDoomie: I love the conspiracies that have popped up around her lol
[2:48:05] JO3Y_C: She not acting tho KEKW
[2:48:05] vaigreene: Ruth does make a good villain
[2:48:06] icephrogg: do u need to see dr kate?
[2:48:06] ilmarcusil: Clueless ACTING
[2:48:06] companhero: bring it to tha mayor
[2:48:06] imSteffin: @SchizoForever, esfandL I've missed you buddy.
[2:48:07] Majopa22: Because Peanut is not a main villain
[2:48:07] squirtlehermit: monkaLaugh üëç Shift 1 best shift
[2:48:07] tombalz: chat where has Andrews beem
[2:48:08] jessielight: Ruth won't back down though
[2:48:09] enfranchise_: I dont think you get rid of her but she is using too much punitive action on her officers without teaching them anything
[2:48:09] viruszwerg125: She can still exist but she should also be tamed sometimes. she shouldnt be able to just act out
[2:48:10] OneDip85: Ruth is like a dictator
[2:48:10] VenomVeinZ: but why
[2:48:10] alexilunda: What do yall talk about during the OOC meetings, is it things like this?
[2:48:12] DeoNone: HUH
[2:48:15] TheLadyCupcake: DansGame
[2:48:15] miketwng: i dont get to watch Ruth. ls she really the villain?
[2:48:15] shin5sato3: Ruth without DAPs would be great content
[2:48:16] Verion: @tombalz busy irl
[2:48:17] SchizoForever: @imsteffin esfandL esfandL esfandL esfandL
[2:48:17] Kaztiell: Ruth is what Pred was to lspd, and everyone loved that
[2:48:17] AnusReaktorMan: @esfandtv SNR buns raid?
[2:48:18] Claxman2000: not when Ruth is making people OOC dejected
[2:48:18] n0oxaskek: @tombalz busy doing irl policing
[2:48:18] GrumpyFelo: What good is a villan if you drive everyone away?
[2:48:19] RobialT: Does the PD need a villain when its barely established?
[2:48:20] skilleto19: All Ruth has to do is turn it down 10% and it would be good YEP
[2:48:20] Kirbyeatsplanets: Slacks is the REAL villain, it's just a long con. Ruth is the Anti-hero of this story, the unexpected ally. The other guy is the one getting the wool pulled over his eyes by both.
[2:48:20] Kingbunsz: I seen ruth streams and to be honest, OCC shes surprised that no other captain has actually stepped in on her bs.
[2:48:22] nationas: @EsfandTV more RP fear or conflict would be better than actual daps i think th
[2:48:22] icephrogg: Dr Kate?
[2:48:24] jalouxz: not enough villains in the city need one as a captain?
[2:48:25] Mandrenn: yeah you definitely need a villain and she is doing a good job at playing it
[2:48:25] jinnytolls: New PD shouldnt be so strict at the beginning, it should take a few months to become strict once everyones in their groove @EsfandTV
[2:48:26] singsyng: @tombalz probably doesn't want to play cause of all this BS in the PD
[2:48:28] zyzzzo: Classic There is a reason everyone always talks about DAPs 24/7
[2:48:29] Aballhair11: Ruth brings balance tot heforcr
[2:48:32] gdfunky: Chat unable to handle conflict or a villain KEKW
[2:48:33] Aballhair11: to the force
[2:48:33] jonfett: No, it's more complex. She's the good guy and you're incimpetent and toxic in her eyes
[2:48:33] VersaceWoW: the problem with it tho is if a streamer whos livelyhood irl is from being an rp cop gets fired its not content anymore
[2:48:34] windstaff54: is she acting as a villain or are you perceiving her as a villain because she is acting by the book?
[2:48:36] FabTheDuckOut: conflict in RP is important but so is quality of life for the players. something is off
[2:48:39] Xen_Crypt: so how do you think this all gets fixed?
[2:48:39] enfranchise_: And protecting De Rolo was kinda nuts
[2:48:40] millzeebb: Too much ooc drama for the premier rp server
[2:48:40] Cthyllah: everyone needs to be acting more like a team, and not taking their stress out on each other
[2:48:40] mitchshadow5: You need to talk to the dungeon master
[2:48:41] Ragestrike: do you guys discuss if the PD is fun in the ooc meetings?
[2:48:41] BobFromAccounts: DEFUND DAPS
[2:48:44] user_nate: Ruth is an asset to RP
[2:48:44] Milenkan: Not much of a villain arc if what youre doing ends up having no cops left to issue daps too LUL
[2:48:45] imSteffin: Schizo doesn't have sub FeelsBadMan
[2:48:45] viruszwerg125: she is just being the villain for the sake of it,. The is no substance behind her at all
[2:48:46] theJOATx: someone make a dap emote
[2:48:47] CrystalDimension: @Inz4ne_ SUPER heavily modded and Esfand has textures pack on top of it
[2:48:48] Dougi: the real villian is archer doin all that crime Susge
[2:48:49] puppietreats: @kirbyeatsplanets SAJ wait but‚Ä¶. slacks..
[2:48:51] kingshwing: yea it seems Cheever wants pushback against her character
[2:48:55] shellbro1: chat gets OOC mad anytime a women is anything but sweet and nice
[2:48:57] SESHBEATS999: @VersaceWoW Adapt and overcome
[2:48:58] Jordan88x: will u ever make a crim character?
[2:48:59] JC9R_: we shouldnt be talking about firing someone when you barely have enough officers as it
[2:49:03] Inz4ne_: @CrystalDimension yea makes sense
[2:49:05] greenburg22: DUH UR A COP
[2:49:06] VariantIN: @shellbro1 fr
[2:49:08] luxxen1: Maybe Cornwoods way to change the PD is to for Cornwood to change Ruth
[2:49:08] the_real_jfk: thats like ruth saying she doesnt ride with officers because theyre below her and she doesnt want to be friends with them
[2:49:12] femboymeow: @VersaceWoW Make a New character and reapply to PD, Use your character for other RP, most people don't depend on being an RP Cop for their Livelyhood they can branch out into different RP
[2:49:12] viruszwerg125: she shouldnt even be allowed as CAPTAIN.
[2:49:13] SeriousBeardCPC: You need someone like your character to balance Ruth out though
[2:49:15] Heimdallr123: Archer is the real villain
[2:49:17] squirtlehermit: she's great
[2:49:21] FizzDidThis: saabHype shes awesome
[2:49:22] stellarnaut: crims start malding when cops do their job

[2:49:30] KrazyKefka: Ruth peepoShy
[2:49:31] PoisonDart11: cheever is actually super nice too ICANT
[2:49:31] AbeFroman2: you dont think shes being a little too harsh at the expense of RP?
[2:49:32] JMcGov14: Can't imagine
[2:49:32] itsdubbz710: sorry but if OTHER PLAYERS cant rp because ruth is abusing the dap system to a point its become a problem.... doesnt make her a good villan it just makes her a villan
[2:49:33] inconspyqs: petition the mayor for qualified immunity
[2:49:33] Tcmasterzzz: mhm
[2:49:33] jinnytolls: New PD shouldn't be so strict at the beginning, it should take a few months to become strict once everyones in their groove @EsfandTV

[2:49:34] Kirbyeatsplanets: @puppietreats it makes sense, doesn't it? it would be a great source of content. Slacks gets chief, demotes ruth, starts cracking down on everything.
[2:49:35] vinnythevman: @shellbro1 stfu bro there is legitimate criticism here
[2:49:35] SchizoForever: i dont think so

[2:49:38] Kalious78: slacks is just as bad at meetings tbh but he gets no hate esfandtv
[2:49:40] spyrouly: She like to be like that, thats the difference
[2:49:41] froogo0: monkaS
[2:49:42] Xiraken: You should be able to appeal DAPS
[2:49:42] Xen_Crypt: its hard enough to RP being hated, its even worse with chat etc
[2:49:42] SurelyBaked: the police are being policed harder than the crims and that‚Äôs the real issue
[2:49:43] rickybegas: RUTH GO HAM
[2:49:44] Sam92: Yung Fierro - Lean Boi NODDERS
[2:49:44] Majopa22: It's good fun watching her stream and her perspective of her villain arc
[2:49:45] aLilBitAlexiss: Dink
[2:49:45] singsyng: @EsfandTV does Cheever even consider herself a bad guy though? has she said it blatantly?
[2:49:46] RaunchyOLDwoman: she is great, and it is hard when people chat hop like poopy heads

[2:49:56] viruszwerg125: that kind of person shouldnt be that high in a position of power.
[2:49:59] boldasluv: unless she doesnt think she is a bad guy
[2:49:59] BiggieLOVDJazz: I think she might just be a bitch low key
[2:49:59] Widemountain: saw a lot of dumbasses from dens stream in her chat today
[2:49:59] jahim_: but also a lot of people dont wanna rp with this fell of stress and worry about characters, its a rp i know, but you still like your plot and character and wanna play it like you want withour worry to have you charcter be completly changed
[2:50:01] Liryns: chat conflates the RP with the streamer and it makes it really hard to be a bad guy
[2:50:02] tellos0: but she's not even being a villain
[2:50:03] Kaztiell: wouldnt Cornwood talk to Ruth though if he have problems with her? @EsfandTV
[2:50:04] Haleos_x: Classic
[2:50:06] imSteffin: tbh I'm a weirdo. I'd masturbate to being the bad guy. I'm basically McConnell(sp) JR.

[4:09:10] n0oxaskek: Daptain Ruthless is essential for good RP
[4:09:11] wellbigsmoke: ruth the spice
[4:09:11] Keldory20: punishment for crims and cops are just too imbalanced, getting a DAP is basically worse than getting felony murder (look how well squeex did in RP even after that case)
[4:09:12] Lopylobster: anyone calling ruth boring is self reporing.
[4:09:12] MarvinOGravel: The cops being scared to do their jobs is part of the RP

[7:50:18] luis_king82: The southern zone is on fire and the police are doing paperwork  emiruLW
[7:50:19] Gachiguru: He should have stayed clean and just be a crim lawyer
[7:50:19] cg4279: This is what is happening.  Cornwood is acting as a site manager not a cop.  Therefore it's too conflicting for more views
[7:50:19] icephrogg: whats the reasoning he would lose bar licenses
[7:50:19] CDowg1: NotLookingAtBooba
[7:50:20] destinygun: @esfandtv Just take his dna and it's a wrap

[7:50:33] ZachFromChat: Hes literally a corrupt lawyer.. Eventually he will lose his BAR tbh. Its just a matter of when
[7:50:39] matanzlatan2000: LONG LIVE THE EMPIRE
[7:50:40] qats: I don‚Äôt think everyone else knows Ramee had been in the car with the weed thrower incident
[7:50:41] realitywolfdog: Key holders
[7:50:43] Joongi_: Loading
[7:50:43] BerryG_333: Would be funny if Peanut owned the PD house
[7:50:44] hellbound0666: ramee is crim. tough shit if he gets fucked
[7:50:45] BigBlue31: I don't think he has to consent to a DNA test
[7:50:45] f0rbin: Pause loading
[7:50:45] Joongi_: Pause
[7:50:47] LilJBoii: at this point he's been made aware of a potential conflict, his decision to stay on
[7:50:48] MysticCasey: What does Cornwood feel though
[7:50:50] Fabushki: yeah ramee has been using a clown mask and robbing people all week
[7:50:50] zrynnn: this is going to be a very long court case
[7:50:50] KYslippy: she asking some strange questions
[7:50:53] Janman88: have is a lawyers DNA not on record anyways
[7:50:54] Wandering_Ranger: ask ramee for his DNA if you want to help, he'll get the hint hopefully
[7:50:55] polesreport: the old republic > new republic
[7:50:55] SchizoForever: he was a monster
[7:50:55] its_R4HUL: Pause
[7:50:56] Spliphos1199: It is
[7:50:57] 1spooky1me: @EsfandTV Did you play at SMU?
[7:50:57] its_R4HUL: yes
[7:50:58] ihhunt3r: Ramee is the most dirty lawyer is hillarious LuL
[7:50:58] ExpedientMiner: Ramee literally handed a crim   knife last night while in interrogation
[7:50:58] Janman88: how*
[7:50:58] dibadibb: why are you so afraid of Ramee?
[7:51:00] Firehead94: Mcnaulty is also trying to force all DoJ to register their DNA so he would be found out anyhow soon @EsfandTV
[7:51:00] x_Gordo: I hope chat knows that ramee doesnt care if he loses his bar license LUL
[7:51:01] its_R4HUL: it is
[7:51:02] SchizoForever: its good
[7:51:02] ChirithyChi: no shot he does that
[7:51:03] MisteryOshiro: I don't think that they've got in character suspicion enough to swab ramee
[7:51:04] EvilCoatrack: All attorneys need to be in the system
[7:51:05] Damnitben: it‚Äôs not
[7:51:05] Rockshock: Ramee wont lose his license unless he's connected to the crimes. Which he isnt.
[7:51:06] tellos0: why would you ask that?
[7:51:06] SageKingdom: he doesnt have to does he ?
[7:51:07] DaltonCL: it is
[7:51:08] TheMah1337: why he was on the scene???
[7:51:08] offbrand: get pc
[7:51:08] Minokawa_82: why
[7:51:09] qats: but everyone should know it could be his dna
[7:51:09] RhalArda: yeah that'd be a bit out of nowhere
[7:51:09] emery_steele: yes
[7:51:10] calcifero7: yeah theres no reason for him to do ot
[7:51:11] jy33130: LUL
[7:51:11] Percolatorx: he wont do it anyway

[7:51:19] qats: you have pc he was in the car
[7:51:19] DismalShark: yes
[7:51:19] ItsMeZexx: it doesn't hurt to ask ramee for some of that DNA
[7:51:19] Ancor_: let it play out
[7:51:20] taraannee: YES UR GOOD MAN
[7:51:20] BoogieAnimal: Unless he is required to by the state?

[7:51:27] afatloki: he made the decision to do what he did so
[7:51:27] Wetidiot: thats like asking shyvon for her dna randomly, you can't do it
[7:51:27] BohLTss: Get bobby to ask lol
[7:51:27] Ryaht: u are a cop
[7:51:27] SpiceWeaseI: youre a cop you go after people

[7:51:30] Janman88: i love ramee as a lawyer but he should know by now what he can chew and what not @EsfandTV
[7:51:30] HeyMeghan: he has access to Mr k‚Äôs house yall found the weed at
[7:51:30] TheMah1337: he would get you fired if he could
[7:51:30] Spliphos1199: Go off what u k
[7:51:30] quaylewastaken: Get him to hand you something
[7:51:31] x_Gordo: @EsfandTV even ramee himself says he doesnt care if he loses his bar
[7:51:31] bobbybeee: i get 100% what yyou mean
[7:51:31] Sweet_BabyJeebus: So? He's a crim
[7:51:32] puppietreats: yeah
[7:51:32] Ryaht: he is a crim
[7:51:32] TruthAboutFalling: Can ya do the old offer a meal trick? Give him a Snr buns box
[7:51:32] NextEraGamer: You‚Äôre just following the clues
[7:51:32] LogicWeasel: ramee played in the mud, he got dirty
[7:51:32] realshowhands: it makes sense if you arent on an RP server
[7:51:33] izahkiel: Was Ramee suspected to be in the chase as well? If not, there's no need to swab Ramee
[7:51:33] Fabushki: exactly you're afraid
[7:51:33] Friendly_Ghost00: Just let it play it out
[7:51:34] DonnBeach: You should go after him. He's corrupt and terrible for the cops
[7:51:34] greyjulian: get food from Ramee, DNA test the food, surely that won‚Äôt have any PC issues
[7:51:34] luis_king82: You are not responsible for Ramee's mistakes... don't you want to destroy his arc?
[7:51:34] JustChelsay: he's not afraid of Rammee, he doesn't want to accidentally incriminate him because of "potential" previous involvement
[7:51:35] Ahs0kaTano: Personally I disagree but whatever you think is best for rp
[7:51:36] SchizoForever: PogU
[7:51:36] tellos0: what's the reasoning?
[7:51:36] skympii: just hold the DNA and then if you get a chance to get ramee DNA and then compare it
[7:51:38] ArdentCause: I say let it play out you're fine - ignore this PEANUT GALLERY
[7:51:39] ZachFromChat: @WildWillie419 Thats what ive been saying. Im not sure the efforts to protect him
[7:51:40] danmago89: But Cornwood hates crime, dont he ?
[7:51:41] Redtwintails: yeah it has to make sense wait
[7:51:41] daunted_mist: Yeah he's a corrupt lawyer lol
[7:51:42] ADK_MtnGamer: get a warrant
[7:51:42] ArtificialHelix: You telling him not to take the case would cause an issue itself
[7:51:44] po0t84: Take Ramee out to dinner, collect plate for DNA
[7:51:45] Gachiguru: @greyjulian 5Head
[7:51:47] TheEmmorf: Just say all PD and lawyers need to get DNA on file for their protection...
[7:51:47] Spikey770: He's a crim and it's his character.
[7:51:47] cocokitty: free rami
[7:51:47] icephrogg: but why would he get asked to do swab
[7:51:47] grlgunk: he will learn the consequences of his actions
[7:51:47] justind33: You can ask but as not a violent felony then if he says no you would need to get a warrant for it
[7:51:48] rukiddinorly: as a cop are you not supposed to?
[7:51:48] GamingWithGardenGnomes: It would be a good way to clear him as a suspect but would it clear him.
[7:51:48] Crashwriter: all lawyers getting swabbed anyway, yes?
[7:51:49] LogicWeasel: peepoSitCowboy  guess we all find out in RP. can't wait
[7:51:49] Spliphos1199: Go off what u know
[7:51:50] pdelectric: You should push for lawyers to have DNA and fingerprints on file
[7:51:51] EngineeringBurnout: @EsfandTV  is it an optimal thing?
[7:51:52] promerian: You can push to have all atourneys in the mdt faster
[7:51:54] slatt5: drop em in the grease cornwood some people gotta learn the hard way
[7:51:55] TehDobster: Imagine a officer not wanting to do his job LUL
[7:51:56] sturg2k5: no evidence on ramee is there
[7:52:01] Sweet_BabyJeebus: Not really
[7:52:01] its_R4HUL: its not you are making it
[7:52:02] GamingWithGardenGnomes: rock meet hard place
[7:52:03] calcifero7: not really
[7:52:04] EPiQ: I mean, OOC: he literally has been far more deeply involved in this than a simple passenger one time.
[7:52:04] Kfoo_: for the benefit of the server
[7:52:05] isla_sillygoose: due diligence
[7:52:05] Ryaht: no
[7:52:05] ZachFromChat: Why though?

[11:47:39] WhereTisWaldo: WHt about this you clock your shift hours so if maybe if your basic shift is 4-8 hours anything after that counts as a second day so a 16 hour shift is 2 days and not 1 day. Allow you to turn 60 days potentially into 30 depending on the hours worked. Not sure if it makes sense but it would allow an equal ground for those who work lots and others who dont

[16:01:18] illuminat4242: @FaramirRat I haven't played the remake as well.  I was pissed that they broke it up into 3rds... They did it so they can make more money but it still pisses me off also the fact that there is no carry over from the first game to the new game so nothing you do in the first game impacts what is done in the 2nd which is stupid

[16:02:10] Xierany: Not true, it's just knowing when to break, how much, just coasting through a corner, and positioning
[16:02:12] 5CookieMonster5: Yeah ask sumsum to teach you the way

[16:03:23] illuminat4242: @FaramirRat its disapointing its supposed to be one big story but when nothing you do carries over then it doesn't feel connected.  It feels like each one is its own stand alone.  Which I isn't how the original plays.
[16:03:29] denimskirts: Don't go so fast into corners

[16:04:39] FaramirRat: @illuminat4242 ya i get where ur coming from, I guess it will matter how much extra story / content they add in to disk 2 and disk 3 to make it worthwhile to play 3 diff games for one story, or maybe they will eventually combine it all into one ff7 remake greatest hit game or some crap to make even more money.

[16:07:41] illuminat4242: @FaramirRat well it frustrates me that they changed the combat style.  I mean I understand it but still annoying.  But they couldn't even make it one long game like it should be and nothing you do in the game matters as it doesn't carry over to the  2nd game.  But I remember late game in og ff7 that was impacted by what you did in the early game. So that is frustrating
