[2:17:10] datsamuraiguy: Good morning Snow!
[2:17:20] Emaykurrz_: I got here half way through this situation, whats the green whistle?
[2:18:15] BluGiant: uhsTea  󠀀
[2:18:16] Jimmysqueeker: penthrox its called.. im a paramedic, i use it..
[2:18:34] endjui: lookin handsome tday mr snow Okayge 👍
[2:18:36] Emaykurrz_: Ohhh, i thought it was a ingame only thing, that's cool
[2:18:49] another0ut: Methoxyflurane inhalers are nicknamed 'green whistles'
[2:18:51] StarWhistle517: its an inhalant right?
[2:18:57] Jimmysqueeker: Methoxyflurane or penthrox.. is a green whistle we use
[2:18:58] Hadez3351: It delivers instant pain relief, but its effects only last 10-15 secs
[2:18:59] another0ut: My partner uses at a&e
[2:19:03] endjui: what
[2:19:06] endjui: uuh
[2:19:08] cruz_1a7x: should totally use the potato filter one day for your face cam
[2:19:16] FlGJAM: sign me up
[2:19:24] Jimmysqueeker: Its very good for fractures or realigning dislocations
[2:19:25] AnalgesicPM: classified as a "volatile anesthetic" apparently...that sounds pretty bad ass
[2:19:30] LokustStar: Like my vape
[2:19:47] Hadez3351: It can make you hallucinate but you are completely lucid in 20secs
[2:20:19] StarWhistle517: hmmmmmmmm i love chemicals uhsSTIRRING
[2:20:22] Jimmysqueeker: lasts for only about 20 mins
[2:20:27] Mr_Jaffs: the life guards use it until the ambos come
[2:20:30] jackxanxcoke: after one use, is it addicting?
[2:20:31] BluGiant: o7
[2:20:34] Kirstty: it uses the gases that are used to put people to sleep for surgery
[2:20:47] Matt_Toeltl: This guy
[2:20:48] cruz_1a7x: basically use snapchat potato filter will post a link on DC

[2:21:18] Phoenix_Rised: @jimmysqueeker so basically, using that is quick for let's say you're popping a dislocated shoulder back into place and the aided won't feel pain or you popping it back in?

[2:22:27] Heith_Au: ie stop playing a vigilante lol
[2:22:47] Jimmysqueeker: @Phoenix_Rised yeah, very quick to kick in.. sometimes people go semi conscious with it... unfortunately if something has been dislocated for a while.. harder to put back in, soft tissue stiffens and makes it more difficult
[2:22:51] ninjagirl8816: uhsSip

[2:24:02] Phoenix_Rised: @jimmysqueeker I understand. I never knew something like that existed. I guess it came about after I left the police department.
[2:24:31] Jimmysqueeker: @Phoenix_Rised we only had it recently.. maybe like 3 or 4 years
[2:25:24] StarWhistle517: spicy spray
[2:25:30] AnalgesicPM: A single shot taser that can't be reloaded might work
[2:25:38] bizzleschwizzle: I keep both in my truck
[2:25:43] Phoenix_Rised: @jimmysqueeker ah , it's fairly new. Wow. I can imagine addicts trying to get their hands on something like that even though the effects are only 10-15 secs.
[2:26:02] StarWhistle517: a little spray of mace will spice up any dish uhsSTIRRING
[2:26:21] AnalgesicPM: @StarWhistle517 bam!
[2:26:31] Jimmysqueeker: @Phoenix_Rised well the inhaler lasts a good 20 mins... but we've never had too much trouble.. i'd guess bigger inner cities might.. its always locked away in our motors
