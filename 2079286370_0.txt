[6:20:46] BadHabitss: I feel like a lot of the systems shes proposing are things that can be introduced down the line if needed, but not really necessary currently
[6:20:59] marksgosaints: It might be easier if you consider a Lt for oversight of these divisions being run by Sgts. Maybe that would help

[6:28:46] Dragon0852: if you get rid of the captain of speed it would make more sense if they just a departments and each department as the same units
[6:28:55] Lungjuice: @raggieee only bob and maybe the c.o.p. that replaces him

[6:30:45] tlv2020: @Shadow_x_Sabors They could.
[6:30:46] AerialAce94: if LTs are running it why do they need a dedicated capt as well?

[6:31:22] Poptarts_inc: Wise Guy widepeepoHappy
[6:31:29] IlexOak: it makes more sense to have the leads be SOP focused and the dept cpt/lt have the oversight?
[6:31:32] Stefffy01: wise guy poggSpin
[6:32:19] poppa_willy: anyone know when the mayor is going to pick a CoP?
[6:32:27] Daxxtr: if only lou was there to set the record straight
[6:32:39] Daxxtr: this people don't have project management experience IRL and it shows

[6:32:58] Krushr: KEKW 󠀀
[6:33:01] Poptarts_inc: Not enough Italy Madge
[6:33:15] Dutch_Tuchd: Maybe department is just the wrong word/concept. the PD and the SDs and Highway and Rangers are departments. But all these different things are just cert programs and those programs need their own command staff member but the rest of that programs members can be anyone from any department who seek out the proper certificate from that program lead.
[6:33:24] marksgosaints: I do like the idea of giving ladyhope more responsibility because she obviously put in a lot of work into this but it's probably a bit too much a bit too big for one person
[6:33:45] A_DeviousHawk: @poppa_willy last time I asked Aleks said for now no CoP until everything has a foundation
[6:34:06] tlv2020: A lot of toes may get crushed
[6:34:16] DrDandelion: "head of"
[6:34:17] raggieee: but no one would be above her if she's making herself Captain
[6:34:46] Daxxtr: im so lost OG
[6:35:00] Shadow_x_Sabors: @raggieee you know they have 3 ranks above captain
[6:35:02] toxict0ni: But if it’s only for certs why would you need some many people
[6:35:04] alexjnr7: Its taking away from the people that helped build those suplb departments. All the sudden they're not in control of their vision
[6:35:04] tlv2020: Bob is probably hoping for some tow truck drama right now
[6:35:04] Streamlabs: no drama, only aleksComfy
[6:35:06] Stefffy01: i’ve lost the plot
[6:35:16] OneOfManyMikes: same here man - I feel like she is asking all pursuits to be under one umbrella, but I also think I am misunderstanding things
[6:35:20] raggieee: @Shadow_x_Sabors yeah but Connies point gave the impression of more than just 3 people above
[6:35:21] DimBanana: I'm confused, it just sounds like trying to fix problems that don't exist
[6:35:49] michaael_g: Objection confusing
[6:35:53] abbeygail: my head is spinning lmao
[6:35:55] Lungjuice: Ranks are state wide and use certs for the "flavouring" part? (parks, bikes, k9 etc)
[6:35:55] Shadow_x_Sabors: @raggieee the point is the ranks arnt even in yet so why even stress about ranks
[6:36:06] toxict0ni: aleksVasuf
[6:36:08] DrDandelion: @michaael_g sustained confusing
[6:36:24] raggieee: @Shadow_x_Sabors because that's what's written
[6:37:01] Shadow_x_Sabors: @raggieee yes that’s the proposal of the whole unit it’s easy to make changes
[6:37:10] A_DeviousHawk: how Aleks says it sounds like more rp
[6:37:23] Stefffy01: Gladge Woods

[6:37:47] Fleajunk: WAIT THIS IS RP?!
[6:37:48] CaptenArc: WHAT rp is happening right now
[6:37:48] RekTSpekT: I could see how having one person in charge of coordinating those specific units could ahve its benefits

[6:37:55] Fleajunk: thought we were fighting for democracy
[6:37:57] Newcool1230: aleksVasuf corporate re-orgs
[6:38:00] Lungjuice: this isnt RP this is rsewrious IRL implications !!!!!! kadge etc emotes here
[6:38:02] RekTSpekT: maybe not a CoC thing but more as a coordination thing
[6:38:04] Lungjuice: *madge
[6:38:07] RoninJawn: It also sounds like there is a semantics confusion... they call departments as branches of police.. and they call the K9 and Motor stuff Units...
[6:38:11] ken_mayor: RP nopp only ERP

[6:39:21] RekTSpekT: have a "Persuit" coordinator instead of a captain in charge
[6:39:23] Krushr: I don't think you need a captain for that though
[6:39:26] pillywix: doesn't require a captain
[6:39:30] CaptenArc: Speed sounds like a task force created to help coordinate with other units
[6:39:47] jared_2015: ill be honest i lost track of this convo like 5 minutes ago LUL
[6:39:51] marksgosaints: Would it not be simpler if she was Lt overseeing Sgts running these divisions instead of a Capt overseeing Lts of divisions
