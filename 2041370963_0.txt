[1:30:29] puppietreats: peanut killed a cop and stole her gun, peanut beat up another cop in snr buns and robbed him, X keeps stealing cars and being an overall deven, chatterbox kidnapped police officers and forced them into a life or death game‚Ä¶.. but denzel was rude so he needs daps ICANT it makes no sense

[1:44:57] hivebob: Ruth is awesome, but there needs to remain balance in high command, so its not all so serious
[1:44:59] Cthyllah: daps are kinda being thrown around like they dont mean anything anymore, given out for not-so-serious situations, thus, daps wont be taken seriously.
[1:44:59] Beep_Cx: peepoLegs Jamgie we back

[1:45:43] SleiFever: I agree, I mean it still is in the GTA universe
[1:45:43] LilJBoii: theres also the more general convo of trying to in character balance the pd cause they've always been op before, ruth has an important role in that whether you consider it overcorrective or not
[1:45:44] detoksi: ya cops need to be higher standard because you got power over the roleplay
[1:45:45] h8h8h8h8h8h8h8: under Max's mayorship Cownwood and the boys could form a LASO
[1:45:46] imDudekid: @esfandtv Your tts voice made my dono sound so privileged and creepy.
[1:45:47] k9_goliath: You need conflict but you also cant cut off peoples initiative.. then it becomes less interesting as a player over time
[1:45:47] oofinside: asking for 3 daps without captains vote is crazy to me WeirdDude good thing turner is disagreeing OKEY
[1:45:47] AndreSays: daps should be precded by a warning for whatever the dap is
[1:45:53] oCallMeViper: Jammies
[1:45:54] Jrey000: it's fine to held to a higher stander but people need to remmember it's still a game LULW
[1:45:54] iwannanuhh: Its way higher stake because if your character is based on being a cop your can loose their purpose.... you cant be fired from being a crim
[1:45:56] Beep_Cx: Put McNulty kiss on projector! @EsfandTV
[1:45:57] Loco_Cubano: I'm ready to Honor the Texas Flag o7

[1:46:00] Stretch27: can you all vote for a new captin? @EsfandTV
[1:46:01] WelshWeaver: my thinking is it‚Äôs good to be serious but in the ends it‚Äôs just a video game meant for fun. it‚Äôs not good to hold rpers to standards of acting like real life cops.
[1:46:01] warner05: Nah, way different than Wrangler
[1:46:02] VersaceWoW: did you see the start of the clowns vs mr ks crew war?

[1:46:05] veladex: Whatever happened to the mountain lion in the prison
[1:46:05] SkyeReaper: I think cause nopixel is difficult to even get into, cops get prio and there are strict rules about rp; cop requirements being higher makes sense, but there's always a line.
[1:46:05] ScreenFresh: they dont want shitlord cops in 4.0. clarkson wouldnt last long
[1:46:06] Ravionus: you have streamed more hours than anyone else last time I checked for RP so of course your going to be involved.  But like I said earlier today why buy a guard dog if your going to keep it locked ina a cage.
[1:46:07] Cthyllah: Its still a game and a show, so it should still be FUN and entertaining, not lame and draining.
[1:46:08] areolagrande__: shouldnt daps be like last resort  options

[1:47:14] captain_steve_420: I think lying in order to get someone fired from the PD should be a bannable offense tbh
[1:47:16] its_khalamari: cool until consequences
[1:47:17] Lyvione: Archer missing again Susge
[1:47:22] PreflexTV: Susge where was archer during all this
[1:47:23] Lord__Gen: They should be there, but the consequences should be temporary or some way to RP around it.

[1:47:47] theshoover: burger slushie Pog
[1:47:48] timedoggg: normal cornwood things
[1:47:49] AeionZen: the prob is that some RPers take this shit seriously and mix RP with their emotions (like xQc) and it creates an odd tension
[1:47:49] Kaztiell: it was a huge problem that they oculdnt punish cops aswell, after you left 3.0 @EsfandTV
[1:47:49] Diamondman121314: I enjoy how Peanut/Client plays

[1:47:59] cwasrightt: @Janman88 copper
[1:48:00] Thraxton1: Crims doing stupid things with no thought and then complaining when they get caught sucks. Crims need to adapt and outsmart the cops to get away with their crimes
[1:48:00] nickauto_: @EsfandTV some people don't think getting arrested is RP, they instead think that cops are taking them away from RP happening
[1:48:01] BoldSlowbro: new interaction near window
[1:48:03] OminousEinherjar: @EsfandTV Cornwood is like a spider, he spits up digestive juice and slurps up his food

[5:24:39] Kascade418: Mary might be able to give manual advice
[5:24:43] FueledGames: irl rev match to downshift, if too much throttle will lose traction when downshifting in a turn causing a ‚Äúdrift‚Äù
[5:24:48] EPiQ: Downshifting also helps brake without losing as much momentum or heating up brakes. But also sets you up to be in the fastest part of the accerlation curve on turn exit.
[5:24:48] Real23Phil: faster
[5:24:49] nonameadventures: you want to be in the correct rpm power band. when you slow down too much in high gears, the rpms goes way down -- thus the need to downshift for more power coming out of the turn

[5:27:37] old_mate_brucie: You'll have more power as you leave the turn. You'll also need to brake less as the gear will force the car to slow down. Its also easier to drift with manual. You go into a turn, shift down, probably a few gears, and then floor it as you leave. You'll get a lot more oomph as you start off. However, you might also end up just doing a donut if you don't steer it right as you leave.
