[2:10:16] wyyndia: hopefully its not a long term thing cuz it could create a clique within the crew
[2:10:17] moistt__: X will want to do it because he has no dongle

[2:10:42] thumphah: didn‚Äôt Mickey try to do something identical in 3.0
[2:10:42] luckerooni: if it goes well maybe x could start funneling parts to langs group even with his own heists

[2:10:52] LPG_0G: isn't that what every crime group is
[2:10:53] mchii: if there is one person who can at least control him a little bit, its marty
[2:10:55] brikbeans: just a place to cash in resources to do a heist for money
[2:10:55] md783: Can someone explain the drake memes?
[2:10:57] iSoulRay: @juicexgx dont think they will let him everyone knows hes a hazard via rp
[2:10:57] Evo_Me: I would love to see marty with the boys too in the future
[2:10:57] Indhii_: it think it‚Äôs just the rest of the crew and the war being so fresh
[2:10:59] trey0ne: would hate JP to hate the vibe's group with Marty
[2:10:59] Nay___1: glizzyL Drake
[2:11:01] corazon_6_9: x is alone so he can't do shit rn
[2:11:04] mov_ris: why do you need jp for heists, hes bad at everything
[2:11:05] Gordiwat4: I feel like marty dont get what the crew is about in rp
[2:11:05] somecyberdude: speedy with x the fking energy is crazy
[2:11:05] PilhasTV: x main goal is to have a good heist group, he isnt going to do anything crazy like he did with the company
[2:11:06] VantageBean: wait whats the plan i just tuned in? @omie sry havent watched much today
[2:11:08] K1ngMarduck: x is a min maxer tho he'll go for a smaller crew for better payout
[2:11:10] DRxZION1992: X would never fuck over Marty and he knows that. He's probably only person who he wouldn't do anything to
[2:11:14] mo___6: fax
[2:11:14] IZGOOD3: trying to convince JP to understand something Clueless
[2:11:15] purthsk: nah explaining to X is the hardest part omE
[2:11:15] NerZulek: u still gonna be in main group as hacker when banks comes up
[2:11:19] Messagge: it helps for now until the main crew needs more than 1 hacker
[2:11:19] cosmicXDhehee: bro whipping the rover üî•
[2:11:24] Daytime_Dairy: yea but wont working with x put a target on your back lowkey?
[2:11:25] maxlbon: people just gotta remember JP + Marty alone is the best heist crew in the city
[2:11:26] sawiblue: standin on biz cuh
[2:11:31] brikbeans: just a pot luck of Heist equipment to go rob banks with
[2:11:31] Palmdale: just find a babysitter for x

[2:12:12] liskydrop: @mrperson1234 i mean oscar will no?
[2:12:12] Axrul: speedy + JP would be entertaining asf
[2:12:12] kazylab: Leaves an opportunity for X to stay solo and you to stay with lang, but do the heists on the side together
[2:12:14] brikbeans: building professional layers of separation like divsions of labor. its pretty RP dank
[2:12:14] VantageBean: Prayge I hope this works out
[2:12:15] thatguyfisk: The fact that x put in 150 already, he gonna want to lead grp or hold gun parts tbf
