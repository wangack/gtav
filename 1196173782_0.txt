[0:00:58] Nightjar: @Varro_Sicarius I know you're a cinema addict NODDERS
[0:01:26] Varro_Sicarius: @Nightjar ngl kinda am, not much to watch this late at night while I do things NODDERS
[0:01:48] Jasott: peepoArrive
[0:01:48] Nightjar: monkaHmm aside from youtube
[0:02:01] philipov: yay, cinema!
[0:02:19] philipov: gee and simon are still streaming @Varro_Sicarius
[0:02:22] Jasott: @Nightjar Not much on Twitch for background noise
[0:02:23] Varro_Sicarius: yeah but
[0:02:32] Varro_Sicarius: youtube still gives me all sorts
[0:02:32] Nightjar: Also Breeh and Pyrion NODDERS
[0:02:51] Jasott: They're all going to be logging off soonish though
[0:02:52] philipov: perfect place to hang out if you want to learn all about fisting gloves and sounding
[0:03:03] Varro_Sicarius: Cinema is random, no need to debate what I get when I can just get a few choices rolled out NODDERS
[0:03:14] Nightjar: Fair
[0:03:22] Zayd_GB: yo
[0:03:51] philipov: I find that when I watch yogs videos on youtube now, I end up wanting to chat, and I realize there's no chat
[0:03:56] philipov: it's depressing
[0:04:07] philipov: youtube comments are nothing like twitch chat
[0:04:10] Fire_Breathing_Fish: i got a culvers ad what did you guys get?
[0:04:21] philipov: I don't get ads
[0:04:32] Fire_Breathing_Fish: ohh.... :(

[0:05:32] vortongaia: Hopefully Cinema doesnâ€™t poop again?
[0:05:33] Varro_Sicarius: actual ads for adblocks
[0:05:50] Varro_Sicarius: it's like radio ads on the TV, feels like it defies the point
[0:05:57] philipov: @vortongaia it's a near certainty hryLafExceptInPain
[0:06:01] vortongaia: Ads for ad companies?

[0:07:53] vortongaia: Yeah I realized that as I finished sending it.
[0:07:57] Nightjar: it's the cinema curse
[0:08:05] philipov: @Nightjar hryCri
[0:08:16] Jasott: @Nightjar It's the background banter we want
[0:08:24] philipov: We have been doing a pretty good job of adding non-TTT and winning the vote since the database got updated

[0:08:38] Nightjar: I'll be back in a bit then peepoLeave
[0:08:48] Varro_Sicarius: that's true, Lots of yogs in one place for banter over 2-3 NODDERS
[0:08:49] Jasott: XD
[0:08:57] vortongaia: We should watch JJ vids in prep for the upcoming JJ
[0:09:00] alienaura1: peepoArrive
[0:09:03] Jasott: peepoPat
[0:09:03] Varro_Sicarius: it's either that or a very niche/specific series for the majority of the night
[0:09:38] Jasott: @Varro_Sicarius I'm mean i'd be fine with Civ as well, but i fee like i'd be in the minority since Civ is also episodic

[0:10:07] philipov: one reason we resort to really long series is because how hard it is to get off of TTT once it gets going. Keeping a long series going once it's started is one of the few things that can compete @Jasott
[0:10:34] Varro_Sicarius: @Varro_Sicarius maybe? I just think TTT is popular for being somewhat fast, lots of randomness/comedy, a lot of Yogs and I do reckon it's just more popular
[0:11:26] philipov: a large part of why TTT is so popular is simply because the vote suggestion algorithm is predisposed to adding lots of options for it @Varro_Sicarius
[0:11:58] Varro_Sicarius: @philipov people still gotta vote on it tho
[0:12:35] vortongaia: I just had to figure out how to copy the video ID on mobile
[0:12:44] philipov: people like TTT, but it doesn't help that it's so easy to keep it going when 3 or 4 of the default options are TTT @Varro_Sicarius
[0:13:19] Varro_Sicarius: @philipov remind me are the voting options pulled from YT's algorithm or cinema's own?
[0:13:23] vortongaia: I do declare I am eager to eat brain matter.
[0:13:39] vortongaia: If a zombie was posh
[0:14:18] vortongaia: Pardon if that was inaccurate Iâ€™m American
[0:14:23] philipov: @Varro_Sicarius Cinema has its own system for pulling the options, but I'm not sure of the details of how it works. It can't be YT's algorithm though. Also, it's different from the implementation of voteadd.
[0:14:40] philipov: @Varro_Sicarius that's why even though the voteadd database was updated, the recommendations still don't have new videos

[0:15:09] Varro_Sicarius: I was led to belive there's some form of delay from when a vid goes out to it being put on the cinema?
[0:15:16] Varro_Sicarius: like a month or something?
[0:15:46] philipov: @Varro_Sicarius right now, those updates are completely manual. It took a year to update the database this year.
[0:16:02] philipov: @Varro_Sicarius until early this month, the voteadd database hadn't been updated since last october
[0:16:06] Varro_Sicarius: a year? oof
[0:16:33] philipov: and the recommendations still haven't been updated
[0:17:11] Varro_Sicarius: Hmm. Maybe something to hope for in the future would be just some flat out info like this, updating the system and how it picks it's options if possible
[0:17:15] philipov: hopefully we will have cinema 2.0 for christmas after jingle jam is over, and that is rumored to have a better implementation of querying for options
[0:17:38] Varro_Sicarius: Oh yeah that'd be nice, the 2.0
[0:17:43] Varro_Sicarius: I imagine it not being their priority mind you
