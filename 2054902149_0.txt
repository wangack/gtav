[0:26:39] JumpStartMyFart: he had to be going 160+
[0:26:46] thricerice1: no you won't catch him that car is could go 200+ downhill
[0:26:52] Zunnun: @thricerice1 he got it last night so don't think so
[0:26:55] Clivent: aaah
[0:26:59] Bassgod42: can you buy it instantly or still need more money?
[0:27:05] getanime: @mavericks312 yeah they need interceptor for that
[0:27:11] mavericks312: what’s crazy is I think Eugene’s car actually got buffed
[0:27:14] NottVillain: this happens everytime I don’t understand why they won’t let y’all have interceptors
[0:27:26] thricerice1: I think he got a warrant 2-3 days ago?
[0:27:31] amanmama: I think if you ask Ruth you'll be able get to patrol in it, but you never ask deansoZ deansoZ deansoZ

[0:27:59] Cosm1cChaos1: @amanmama he asked got told no

[0:31:03] autisticboots: ruth needs to buck some ideas up bro
[0:31:09] luis_king82: Cornwood is a bad driver dude
[0:31:14] Zunnun: @stewy21 no worries the thing is any info a streamer gets from chat is considered meta if he don't know in charater so us saying blind means den in charater didn't see so not he can't go back and check deansoHeart2
[0:31:26] jetbawls: that hits a casual 170
[0:31:29] mavericks312: yea Eugene’s car went from topping at 105 to damn near 190 now with no turbo

[1:19:07] JuloLeBro: @JuloLeBro damn they really cant get a chase then xd
[1:19:15] Xellwrath: @ClutchMoses No they don't. What they need is for faster / personal PD cars. Also the moment PD has Air 1, all city jobs are are likely to fail. Its balanced out.
[1:19:21] Landoram: so frustrating you can't catch anything up here

[1:23:57] ReverendHunter: you would be better hiring 40 cops and firing 30 of them, than slowly working the way to a functional pd
[1:23:57] TheMagnificentBastard: @sacredtenshi they are what they eat
[1:23:59] cotchplays: @axionxxxx upgrade the PD, crims cry, cars get upgraded, PD slow, PD cry, repeat... shit needs to be balanced not constantly upgraded
[1:23:59] Athasin: @Sacredtenshi It's balancing back and forth. One week it favors cops, the next it favors crims, back and forth.
[1:24:04] m4l1kkk: LOCKPICK
[1:24:06] ramsin50: cops can't keep up now then crims won't be able to keep and it becomes a cycle

[2:01:38] purplepoodle89: @Doqx42 you don't understand how shitty getting caught as a crim can be, can litteraly set you back months of work, getting caught because you fucked up is fair but game-glitches getting you caught is hella-cringe

[2:37:16] jackmb99: you should get yourself expelled from police and become a criminal it’d be a good storyline
[2:37:18] RYANizee: Abdul constantly says on his stream why are they not chasing me it’s even annoying for the crims

[5:37:16] FilzG: @sonadapop that too, for sure. But she brought that up on her. It's not just her character, it's her persona. If I were her, I'd get killed by Mr. K and perma, then make a new more friendlier character
