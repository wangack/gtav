[1:51:29] riggity_rickster: Max did not authorized the 300k, Etta did without anyone's consent. As to why the PD is punished by proxy, that's a whole other story
[1:51:30] theblackdog808: I like that they're trying to keep budgets planted
[1:51:30] Doqx42: @siryork1 slacks only paid Calista 25k for 2 engines, no more was spent out if it

[2:08:43] jeremyks9: Turner and ruth tried to build a case against the mayor i think
[2:08:43] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: triple 6

[2:09:30] TheGroxEmpire: PD barely getting up, what power struggle
[2:09:30] numbuh34: the power has been struggling
[2:09:31] NashFi: Yeah well also Beric was one of the officer assigned to Ruth's treason case to see if there was any charge, I can see why Turner would react on the defensive as well
[2:09:31] sunmoonburn: i think it's funny how many ppl hate Ruth, it's like everybody hates Joffrey from GOT, but the actor playing him is the goat for turning so many ppl against him, same with ruth ;DD#

[2:09:42] goldrogerffs: he has a month to get shit done, mayor's term is gonna run out soon
[2:09:43] Lanineer: captains all thought one of the captains should be chief
[2:09:43] MargaPlaits: 1 o7 should be your callsign

[2:13:24] ArkVulcan: Slacks is too naive for his own good. He's the only captain who's had Cornwood's back despite the MRPD incident which led to Turner deciding to fire him.
[2:13:25] Athasin: Remember when everyone said Nekoda would be the perfect man for the liasion job? Boy were they wrong.

[2:13:54] ArkVulcan: There's still hope for Slacks. He's a victim of Ruth's bullshit.
[2:13:54] BIumenT0pF: it was just mdt scuff and one talked cleared that up
[2:13:55] bosschar95: ruth
[2:13:56] polarhehexd: if beric did get rid of nekoda, what would happen about pd liason
[2:13:57] DanLGG: I do to. you have to rule with an iron fist but you can’t make people afraid to do their job
[2:13:57] UseTheForcePhasma: Ruth-less style lol
[2:13:58] knightronical: Beric is going to go nuclear, he has LASO under sheriff to fall back on.
[2:14:01] Kelborn: Who the fuck puts up reports for a traffic stop anyway, they don't even do reports for that in real life
[2:14:03] King0fKhaos: NO IT WASNT
[2:14:03] getriggityrekt: Crims gonna run this city because PD is just forever going to stay a mess

[2:16:39] RyinTwitch: yes
[2:16:39] Creative145: what
[2:16:40] dudemanbroo: its always been established QI isnt a written law
[2:16:40] tak0g0dz: LUL
[2:16:41] kointoss88: qualified immunity means they can't sue individual officers
[2:16:42] jonski1220: is a WWWWW
[2:16:42] BabyJoker: cause and effect
[2:16:42] v_SHIFT_v: wait a sec
[2:16:42] CyboargTV: Crane will not be happy bout that
[2:16:43] Killsauce: its a concept not a law
[2:16:45] DookieSmooth: there is no qualified immunity
[2:16:46] SecretChiley: But if someone argues that in court, wouldnt they win since its not written anywhere?
[2:16:48] insanealec: The cops aren't in trouble, the other guys are
[2:16:48] Kelborn: Some of these judges have been dropping the ball hard on these cases
[2:16:48] zMalloc: No
[2:16:50] Makemepurr: Crane said that you have no such thing here
[2:16:51] kointoss88: Crane clarified it last night
[2:16:52] kiolkjm: ya xavier was talking about quitting after this case cause murphy was being an ahole
[2:16:52] artan107: cant throough bench tho
[2:16:53] ryukieduo: we NEEEED some more Donald Bush!!!!
[2:16:54] SpiceWeaseI: QI isnt a thing in nopixel i thought
[2:16:54] comrade_rabbitt: laying some groundwork maybe
[2:16:56] CatmanJay: CRANE spoke about it at the meeting
[2:16:59] MexiBrent: its only for cops not civs
[2:17:00] jman_sucks: yeah you have qi crane was talking about it earlier he just dosnt want to write it out
[2:17:00] TheLastRace: @Deansocool Your one lifer's are heroes :)
[2:17:01] aguy02: man you gotta stop bringing those bushes. ur talking all your friends down LULW
[2:17:01] jeremyks9: no one expects anyone to perma so
[2:17:02] Athasin: Yes. He said no matter what the cops did, the Cuhmunity caused it to happen
[2:17:02] TheKillerChalupa: watch the council meeting last night nekoda talked about and crane said things
[2:17:02] TenseTokki: The Donald's are legit destroyers LUL
[2:17:03] jukes_on_u: @Deansocool i think ur brain read the title but ur eyes didnt
[2:17:03] ItssSoofluffy: He just gave the PD the freedom to kill anyone. Even though they did not do the final blow because they were part of the interaction it is their fault.
[2:17:04] Ruperallmighty: But they do say that it depends on the Judge
[2:17:05] tommytsnutz: each Donald bush is gonna create a new precedent
[2:17:06] SanchoPanza49: That's not what he's saying though
[2:17:07] Silvertap: It was explained at consul meeting that there is qualified immunit to PD @Deansocool
[2:17:12] Killsauce: theyre not going to codify QI
[2:17:14] CatmanJay: get the CRANE clip in
[2:17:17] DanLGG: @deansocool crane explained last night that qualified immunity will never be in legislation because it is covered as PD is working as police of the State
[2:17:19] fly_boy0723: so because someone causes a disturbance, an officer shows up, shoots a bystander, and its the person who causes a disturbances fault? that is so much bullshit
[2:17:20] shmeeso: yeah crane explained it last night - for cops, they can't be individually sued, you only sue the whole PD
[2:17:22] h_1905a: Come on UNITED
[2:17:22] weealexxx: crane did say they dont have it in writing, but it kinda exists
[2:17:26] J_Stomi: bush family making case laws
[2:17:27] getriggityrekt: all you need a lawyer to cite this ruling as precedent and you have QI.
[2:17:28] insanealec: It's stating that you aren't safe in police custody, and they have no duty to keep you from dying while you're cuffed.
[2:17:31] DerLuvio: Crane talked about it in the council meeting.
[2:17:32] xenos620: Free my boy Fredo TwoTime!
[2:17:35] dudemanbroo: yes thats the point, QI is a principle that can be applied based on the situation. it has always been here but will never be a written law
[2:17:35] ConductorCrunchy: “just call me Precedent Bush” haha
[2:17:40] kointoss88: ill find the clip
[2:17:45] zMalloc: No, they started the fight , which meat the cops had to step in
[2:17:51] Doqx42: qualified immunity is left up to the judge discretion to be decided case by case vs having it in legislation providing permanent protection
[2:17:55] CatmanJay: lol @conductorcrunchy
[2:17:55] tak0g0dz: They said QI is supposed to be considered in the judges ruling @deansocool
[2:17:56] Makemepurr: DonalBush ruined them!!!
[2:17:58] ItssSoofluffy: Cause of death was a large gash to the back of the skull. Which was caused by a baton.
[2:17:59] JsLeos: they started the fight
[2:18:02] MrSirDudeGuyBro: @zMalloc this
[2:18:12] DanLGG: someone send the crane clip.
[2:18:16] DanLGG: 100%
[2:18:25] Toluen090: What was the outcome?
[2:18:26] fly_boy0723: should not have chased them
[2:18:29] jman_sucks: yes you shouldve been covered by QI too
[2:18:30] TheOGWombat: yes
[2:18:34] Athasin: He said no matter what the cops did, they did it while trying to stop the Cuhmunity, and it's the Cuhmunity started it so they're responsible.
[2:18:37] AnusReaktorMan: https://clips.twitch.tv/FamousCheerfulDuckAllenHuhu-ZsesdKEToWnvk2AY
[2:18:37] Rhysing: he means if the police actions are calculated in the circumstance
[2:18:39] ItssSoofluffy: But since they started the fight,  then they are responsible for his death. Even though they only used fists and hit him in the face.
[2:18:41] LoneSoldier021: That's a good point, I would argue the PIT wasn't necessary, it's you escalating
[2:18:41] dudemanbroo: it will always depend on the case. its not a yes or no with QI ever
[2:18:44] DanLGG: Civilians can not sue an individual of the police force. They can sue the PD
[2:18:50] Killsauce: you didnt get arrested for it. you got an internal punishment. if he tried to sue you it would fall under qi if they find you were acting in good faith
[2:18:50] knightronical: Yeah, you cant be sued, they can only sue the state (PD) thats QI
[2:18:50] Landoram: That ruling should help the case against them for Gregory's lawsuit...your pit was due to the assailants actions
[2:18:53] Erohw666: if people make 1 life chrs who go out looking to die.... I think charges should be laxxed on whoever kills the 1 lifer cause that 1 lifer is purposely going out looking to die.
[2:18:53] ItssSoofluffy: The third guy didnt even hit Donald Bush and got charged for 2nd degree murder.
[2:18:53] Rhysing: the cops were trying to prevent a murder
[2:18:54] getriggityrekt: Vehicle is a deadly weapon though and I don't think the baton is considered lethal
[2:18:54] SeriousBeardCPC: You can easily make the comparison in my opinion
[2:18:55] TheOGWombat: but that doesn’t mean you can’t be dapped. daps arent law
[2:19:01] jinnytolls: sniper
[2:19:04] blowaways: lolwut
[2:19:07] xenos620: sniper take the shot
[2:19:08] Promoniks: sniper
[2:19:14] PacGamer: sniper
[2:19:14] bleu_starrr: Lmao
[2:19:17] noBryan_: yea that’s qualified immunity the eyes in the courts, but it’ll be separate for you cause pd is internal punishment
[2:19:19] bleu_starrr: Wack
[2:19:20] jukes_on_u: ruth spotted sniper
[2:19:21] thesmoogers: I believe so.  I believe they are starting to set the groundwork to ensure that people understand there is a level of QI.
[2:19:22] threedogger: boom him
[2:19:22] fly_boy0723: cannot pit when civilians around. has to be safe
[2:19:23] AnusReaktorMan: o7

[2:19:40] xenos620: KEKW
[2:19:41] meatlove69: that good one
[2:19:41] SeaOfEmpty: Chat there's what people say and then there's what actually happens. A precedent is about what actually has happened in court and it doesn't matter if the judge or anyone else says it's not precedent. If it happens and that was the ruling that's precedent, because The judicial system is required to be even handed.
[2:19:43] ItssSoofluffy: @Leritt he is not
[2:19:45] DanLGG: Den zel would not have been in that car chasing that fleeing felon if he was not policing per the States request therefore covered by qualified immunity
[2:19:50] MDM4ever1986HD: Okay no more classic clips then
[2:19:51] CoherentScreams: @getriggityrekt Baton is less lethal than a gun, but a strong blow to the head can easily kill even the toughest human on this planet
[2:19:55] hodgedogg: LUL
[2:19:56] SpiritEX: baton is the most inhumane lethal weapon dunno why cops dont use tazers instead

[2:35:45] getanime: @iMarks Why? It's her decision right?
[2:35:55] washreyacolmsatt: @wijj99 Beric yea, he is THE BOSS

[2:36:11] chmbrs: make his facial expression a giant smile @Deansocool
[2:36:12] noircoeur: its still mad if shes not held accountable
[2:36:12] Faildude: She probably resigned because the mayor took her vote, what's the point of being captain if you're gonna get bitched out
[2:36:16] Athasin: @getanime Nah she had to take a break because of family issues
[2:36:29] CosmicFirefight: Denzel on cloud 9

[2:36:39] wijj99: @washreyacolmsatt NICEthen he can appoint Ruby as captain instead of Ass. if she's down
[2:36:39] ramsin50: didn't xavier call why are you with the other team
[2:36:48] knightronical: She RP a villain and the villain was defeated, thats a great RP arc. Should thank Cheever for that.
[2:36:49] skeeeperr: @faildude that's what she was doing the whole time with other captains, finding ways to not be held accountable by them
[2:36:52] westnorwoodnobody_bozo: love the girth bro

[2:40:00] knightronical: @LSPXI Same, but I can see it could be why... people were getting really toxic
[2:40:02] Silvertap: He doesn't even want to be senior
[2:40:03] DanLGG: that’d be wild if Ruth was a double agent to see if Slacks and Turner would allow her to be corrupt like they did. Imagine she’s the one that outs the convo in the hall way completely fucking Turner and Slacks.

[2:42:24] knightronical: Derolo has no ass to kiss if Ruth resigned, if she messes up she's toast. Turner and Slacks both arent fans of her already
[2:42:25] Tier3Timmy: Cornwood is PPO so not captain for a while
[2:42:29] HavocusRex: I don't think he'd want it
[2:42:30] jman_sucks: did she say why she resigned? i seen her discord post about her dad but i didnt see her mention anything since? Hope shes alright Cheever deserves soo much love shes played Ruth so well.
[2:42:30] tinstarfish99: Would they promote someone that's ppo?
[2:42:34] Ebonhawke7: Cornwood is Sheriff if he's in a command position
[2:42:40] ncs_310: Turner would never agree to that, but Beric will

[2:56:08] chmbrs: EZ
[2:56:13] hereforff9: thats some terrorist shit ngl lol
[2:56:14] serioushustle: The fact cornwood got his job back and den zel has to go through academy is wild. Based on what they were both fired for it should he the other way around
[2:56:22] BDG_parth28: @AIex0209 yh he did multiple
[2:56:27] v_SHIFT_v: @AIex0209 that was a campaign
[2:56:28] MrSirDudeGuyBro: @AIex0209 he did but denzel needs to make a new one because it was den
[2:56:39] K00PAD00P: @serioushustle you sure about that?
[2:56:48] Kelborn: @serioushustle the only reason that happened is because of the mayor overruling Ruth's vote
[2:56:55] microtech123: @AIex0209 that was more like commercial for his position as chief
[2:56:56] MDM4ever1986HD: https://clips.twitch.tv/JollyBelovedSushiTinyFace-VWFKlM9Uy7xLmWkx
[2:56:57] washreyacolmsatt: for me Murphy is by far the best judge, him or halo
[2:57:00] Hewb: @serioushustle cornwood was plain fired tho. then the msyor stepped in
[2:57:07] Hewb: mayor*
[2:57:12] xypher85: @Deansocool i think you should just upload the Reacting to clips on your main channel, its just sitting idle and since it has more subs, the vids will get way more engagement
[2:57:12] dj_walrino: @serioushustle The captains had to set an example with Den... so dumb lol
[2:57:19] CosmicFirefight: @serioushustle Den Zel will probably be back to officer rank BEFORE Cornwood given he's being "fast tracked" to be fair
[2:57:36] EGGZOLENTZ: @serioushustle the reaaons were solid when u think about it, denzel said he didnt know he couldnt do things. Cornwood said your full of shyt. They were gonna fire cornwood. They were rehiring or keeping denzel
[2:57:37] trinisavage6: sooo Manchester is blue
[2:57:40] hereforff9: oh shit thats right because of ruths ongoing suspension at the time her vote was usurped by the mayor, i wonder if that pissed ruth off bigtime lol
[2:57:45] MDM4ever1986HD: https://clips.twitch.tv/DifferentSuspiciousTildeSaltBae-1FKAZrTZV33FpdXB
[2:57:48] Calmleee: @deansocool what did u do, why we in court
[2:57:55] trinisavage6: evening everyone BDGFL <3 <3 <3
[2:57:56] SpiceWeaseI: @serioushustle cornwood only got reinstated as PPO because mayor max had to step in and overrule on ruth's bullshit
[2:58:00] serioushustle: So why didn't the Mayor reinstate den zel lol
[2:58:08] knightronical: They kept changing the review process after Den's panel to make it more fair also... which is honestly bullshit. js.
[2:58:28] CosmicFirefight: @serioushustle because PD already offered his job back
[2:58:29] Kelborn: @serioushustle the legislation wasn't in place at the time of Denzels review
[2:58:32] dj_walrino: When is Den going through academy again?
[2:58:34] MDM4ever1986HD: https://clips.twitch.tv/InnocentKathishWormStinkyCheese-DbNfYtLPUUptrRkO
[2:58:39] MrSirDudeGuyBro: @serioushustle because he got invited to acadamie but he willl be fast tracked
[2:58:40] hereforff9: crazy she did that during february thats all im saying CAUGHT
[2:58:41] captain_steve_420: Cornwood's panel was pretty fucked too. Stacked against him
[2:58:52] EGGZOLENTZ: @serioushustle that was b4 the whole ordeal plus they made that report against denzel or Ruth did lol
[2:58:54] kointoss88: Captains literally had a conversation saying they have to make an example out of the first person to reach 10 DAPs

[2:59:49] hereforff9: somebody needs to find a way to jump over that thing and tackle the judge
[2:59:51] yungnams: we dont have the facilities for that
[2:59:52] captain_steve_420: Onlyt one of the auditors said he didnt see a problem with the daps. The rest and the mayor all said there was
[2:59:54] ChaoticSanity: @BLazOR_Prime I watched the meeting, I watched them tell cornwood he was whining for no reason, daps deserved lol
[3:00:03] iwannanuhh: some of the reviewers said the way daps were applied subjectively was an issue
[3:00:04] Resmade: get ya tits out then
[3:00:06] EGGZOLENTZ: @fre3zy099 thats literally the meaning of laundring money deansoP Kappa

[3:00:16] getthh1996: what her twitch name
[3:00:21] fre3zy099: different things
[3:00:22] captain_steve_420: @ChaoticSanity Only one of them said that. Stop spreading misinformation

[3:01:02] juanelemichele: They are equipped to look at it objectively because the were cops
[3:01:02] CallMeEnki: Marijuana "controlled dangerous substance" LMAOOOO
[3:01:12] Riqui__: Well none of the auditors got to talk to Den
[3:01:12] knightronical: Jenny Hall disagreed with some of the Daps. Swensan said they were deserved but he still disagreed with the actions taken during the review panel.
[3:01:14] hereforff9: @Scully_18 LUL
[3:01:19] sluggerrrrrrr: I watched some of the early clips from cornwood at the start of 4.0 and he did some wild shit, however he is a good cop now IMO, no reason to fire him when he has shown he has grown, also Den also didn't deserve to be fired that was total BS
[3:01:23] jornalberts: Enjoying the content lately, keep it up!

[4:19:27] spankybo: @ruttdog21 its cuz suarez was ppo for shift 2 and thats why it took him so long to become full officer
