[6:50:49] imhereforjuggs: You went to rental twice. im talking about rental. not test drive lol.
[6:50:49] freak1030: all good
[6:50:50] Mandrenn: smart decision to not use it
[6:50:51] who_peterpark: have you learned to picklock cars?
[6:50:54] Alex2theMoon: you did your best, but Dundee will still yell at you
[6:50:54] imtallpaul123: yeah robbing random npc is good enough
[6:50:58] wtfitztom: if u went straight to the rentals when he first texted you
[6:51:00] slumvillager: Eli tried, but Dundee's personality will likely lead him to blame Eli, wrongfully, nonetheless
[6:51:00] wtfitztom: :P
[6:51:04] ZekeXD: i wanna hear what dundee says when you don't know where legion square is LUL
