I'd pray to Lysium every night before I go to bed, thanking for the life I've been given. "Lysium is love", I would say, "Lysium is life". My dad hears me and calls me a redditor. I knew he was just jealous for my devotion of Lysium. I called him a Juicer. He slaps me and sends me to go to sleep. I'm crying now and my face hurts.
