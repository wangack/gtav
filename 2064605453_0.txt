[1:52:23] DraculaSpectacula: You can always get more GPUs
[1:52:28] AndreasMartin1: How much would the BUTC coin cost if we'd buy it outright? Cause per logic we could view BUTC as money as well
[1:52:29] TheronxHunter: we get it bro just do moonshine
[1:52:30] DraculaSpectacula: But you need monies for GPU
[1:52:32] dr3ddlaw: you already know the answer
[1:52:33] iamloyaltytv: MOON IS MADE OF CHEESE
[1:52:37] bugsy30: 4x DankMods
[1:52:49] floody555: if 1 6060 add axtra 0.4 will 2 create 0.8 extra?
[1:52:50] SeriousFluffy: I get it @Whippy we need to rob MoonMoon!
[1:52:55] dr3ddlaw: we need a house for the realistic amount of BUT we need to farm
[1:52:55] ShaqMaker: Moon= gpu, steady income, more rp, better for the boys, less struggle, a house, car
[1:52:56] RS_Paul: 75 of them isn't it
[1:53:00] pepe_silvia_as: AAAA
[1:53:05] Krisgadgets: i would do moon while you can  before ingredients Go Sky High  any one can get ButCoin
[1:53:10] DraculaSpectacula: This is so fuckin goofy snsnsns
[1:53:12] iamloyaltytv: MOON = GPU INCOME = MORE STUFF
[1:53:16] AndreasMartin1: So if we increase our BUTC income with 0.5 we'd earn 1k a day. Versus active gameplay with the moonshine, that'll likely be more work yet more money
[1:53:17] crispyplusadygames: I would go with moon
[1:53:22] Nomad_Ninja: ok, but the real question: Does butc translate into cash, if so, what's the ratio, and will it cover your expenses
[1:53:32] pwnageclapz: money nets you more rn YesYes worry about buttcoins when you get outta debt
[1:53:37] floody555: ok so thats what I meant, every 6060 equals 0.4 more
[1:53:48] DraculaSpectacula: What pwn said
[1:53:52] floody555: I understand
[1:54:16] ThaAlmightyPete: If you stare at the gpu fans enough you realise theyre just flashing lights and now im about to pass out peepoJuice

[2:05:38] Mrbojangles1224: What about the amd fx3d chips?
[2:05:39] witherouz: the problem is gtas engine, you need to limit FPS to around 120, after 120 the engine gets mad and stutters even if your pc is more than capable
[2:05:39] pwnageclapz: intel cpu generational gains lately just fucking suck DICKS YesYes AMD ryzen all the way
[2:05:41] NoranorTV: Lilith maybe??

[2:08:32] Bigcountry182: Slightly overclock the CPU? Hmmge

[2:10:41] Xian_TV: @Xian_TV is it lower grade than 4080? i thought it would've been better
[2:10:45] pwnageclapz: @Xian_TV ive been debating on selling my 4070ti and buying a used 4080 just for the extra VRAM NODDERS
[2:10:49] Bacon_Space: chat is in DinkDonk  DonkBonk mode
[2:11:02] MikeOnSky: @Xian_TV 600$? what
[2:11:09] ShaqMaker: @mikeonsky oh mine was a driver's update
[2:11:16] Xian_TV: @Xian_TV i'm running a 3060ti and i love it as an upgrade from my previous rx580, runs everything and multiple things pretty well but i just want MORE
[2:11:27] Nomad_Ninja: I use my cpu's igfx to render stream, and it does just fine
[2:11:34] DieMrCupCake: I dont think 4080 supers are $600... The 4070 ti super is $800
[2:11:40] Xian_TV: @Xian_TV yeah on the Nvidia page yesterday you could get a 40xx super for around $600
[2:11:43] FateReturn: @Xian_TV @Xian_TV its performace is almost the same
[2:11:49] MikeOnSky: 4080 supers stars from 1200$

[2:12:06] dennisknox04: wicked
[2:12:14] DieMrCupCake: The 4070 supers are $600
[2:12:18] pwnageclapz: the super cards shouldve been what was released a yr ago YesYes
[2:12:21] Xian_TV: @FateReturn just happy not to see 3060s for $1400 anymore

[2:15:32] al_ex: I just got myself a 4070 super and it's night and day from my 2060
[2:15:36] Kagorus: @Whippy the only thing temperature does is use less or more power based on temperature its not allot but its a little bit so general rule of thumb is you get *slightly* better performance the cooler your gpu is
[2:15:46] DieMrCupCake: the 4070 has 12gb of VRAm lmao a 3060 ti is not better
[2:15:47] MikeOnSky: gpu benchmarks says 47% overall performance not using the dlss for the 4070

[2:18:42] ThaAlmightyPete: Drake sized pipe?
[2:18:43] RS_Paul: i'd like your bigger pipe
[2:18:45] Kagorus: AV1 is just MUCH more effecient encoding @Whippy
[2:18:45] pwnageclapz: Mrbojangles1224 AV1 is what youtube uses, it just looks better, runs better and whatnot
[2:18:49] iOffline: It's 8am Saturday morning.. too much nerd for me this early
[2:18:52] Lawdie123: @Mrbojangles1224 Saves twitch bandwidth, but the end user has to decode more data. aka you spend more on your power bill nmpSMILE
[2:19:02] dennisknox04: tech talk w/whippy
[2:19:02] DieMrCupCake: the DLSS on 40 series cards is so good
[2:19:03] pwnageclapz: @pwnageclapz YesYes you can on twitch but its very resource heavy
[2:19:07] pwnageclapz: OMEGALUL

[2:19:18] Dumpy5: D:
[2:19:20] Nomad_Ninja: @MikeOnSky you CAN... but the platform you stream to needs to support it. Twitch currently does not
[2:19:20] trueacewyatt: why kill kitty
[2:19:22] iOffline: Launched!
[2:19:22] iamloyaltytv: AAAA
[2:19:23] Mrbojangles1224: @pwnageclapz got it, thanks!
[2:19:26] romfi: AAAA

[2:19:56] floody555: Eugeene?
[2:19:57] MikeOnSky: hope they implement that for 3000 series
[2:20:03] ThaAlmightyPete: Bitrate better?
[2:20:28] pwnageclapz: @ThaAlmightyPete with Av1 you need less bitrate to cover the artifacting and shit
[2:20:28] Mrbojangles1224: Allow for higher resolutions than 1080?
[2:20:30] Lawdie123: Or twitch can keep the bitrate the same and just have a less data usage KEKW
[2:20:30] Nomad_Ninja: allowing higher bitrates would need more bandwidth
[2:20:42] pwnageclapz: NODDERS it gets artifacty
[2:20:44] ShaqMaker: Does it also help twitch delay
[2:20:46] HLwhiteyUK: nope
[2:20:47] DieMrCupCake: no
[2:20:58] babushka1789: is this a VOD?
[2:20:59] Bigcountry182: Not as bad as other streams when it does

[2:22:19] bigflux: is there racing in np yet?
[2:22:20] romfi: bazzYay
[2:22:22] pwnageclapz: ShaqMaker do you use the RTX video mods in control panel too?
[2:22:23] iOffline: Ever watch WWE streams? Those are a blocky mess
[2:22:26] Kagorus: @Whippy to just give you a basic Summary x264 is the OG format for most video, x265 is a slightly more effecient one, AV1 is a brand new tech thats far more effecient but needs specialised hardware, a bit like how intel QSV used to really speed up x264 encoding, x264 vs AV1 looks like 3-5X the bitrate so you could have your bitrate allot lower yet look the same as a x264 stream
[2:22:32] romfi: RatRun
[2:22:37] Nomad_Ninja: this run makes me miss the Dundee Gran Pree
