[0:40:41] adzse: In 1987 the avant-garde composer John Cage wrote a piece of music called “Organ²/ASLSP.” The score is eight pages long. But Cage left an unusual instruction for those who wanted to perform it: “As Slow As Possible.” What’s “possible,” of course, is open to interpretation. One performer played it at 29 minutes, another at 71 minutes and another at 8 hours. One performance lasted 14 hours and 56 minutes.
[0:40:42] ben_vincent: dizzTHINK
[0:40:45] adzse: But 23 years ago a group of Cage lovers decided to do them one better. So they built a special organ, put it in a run-down medieval church in the town of Halberstadt, Germany, and announced that they were going to play “Organ ²/ASLSP” really, really slowly — over a period of 639 years! The performance is scheduled to conclude in 2640. This organ plays itself and will continue to play until the song is finished. dizzTHINK

[6:02:18] reliantt_: what is in the whipage atm
[6:02:20] reliantt_: what turbo
[6:02:27] reliantt_: ur cooked man
[6:02:32] reliantt_: 60 is the best probably
[6:02:39] JDXL: wait
[6:02:41] JDXL: u got a 99?
[6:02:42] reliantt_: Hmm
[6:02:44] JDXL: WHAT
[6:02:49] reliantt_: u should put the 99 in the truck
[6:02:53] reliantt_: that would be NUTS
[6:02:59] JDXL: top speed better
[6:03:05] Lotuzlol: Lotuzlol subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 4 month streak! 5 months with the man himself. I’ve been loving the content on the subscriber only furry cosplay discord you’ve been doing, keep it up. dizzLL

[6:03:05] potatisbot: Resub hype! Lotuzlol just subscribed, 5 months in a row PogChamp <3
[6:03:14] JDXL: cuz getting away from cops if u just go on a straight u outrun anyone
[6:03:22] reliantt_: bigger turbo=higher top speed=longer to spool=slower accel
[6:03:25] mr101legend: Bro??
[6:03:31] Rabituwu: where??
[6:03:31] benskeletor: omE
[6:03:40] reliantt_: 80 is def solid
[6:04:10] reliantt_: rare as fuck
[6:04:12] reliantt_: good cop
[6:04:31] reliantt_: can you only buy one?
[6:04:54] gigamex: do smaller turbos help with faster accel? or do they just fuck accel
[6:05:00] reliantt_: @gigamex faster accell
[6:05:02] reliantt_: lower topspeed
[6:05:03] gigamex: gotcha
[6:05:12] reliantt_: honestly buying alot would probably be a good investment
[6:05:12] Librv: next song PagBounce
[6:05:14] JDXL: EZ
[6:05:20] reliantt_: you could probably resell them for alot
[6:05:22] gigamex: so it might be a good idea to pop a small turbo in the trashmater?
[6:05:25] JDXL: nah keep the 99 tbh
[6:05:39] JDXL: cuz you can curb boost to accelerate faster
[6:05:42] benskeletor: you'll definitely feel the difference when you switch back to 88
[6:05:45] reliantt_: whats the top speed on the 99
[6:05:54] gigamex: 188 was it?
[6:05:56] reliantt_: surely 200
[6:05:56] gigamex: i think
[6:06:00] gigamex: 190?
[6:06:01] Librv: Dance
[6:06:05] gigamex: AlienDance
[6:06:10] benskeletor: its definitely possible to hit 200
[6:06:13] reliantt_: i mean
[6:06:16] reliantt_: no cop is catching you
[6:06:19] reliantt_: even if ur 150 top speed
[6:06:22] JDXL: hitting 200 in that 4 door is insane
[6:06:23] reliantt_: still cooking them
[6:06:35] sub_wrx2004: 20 I'd say
[6:06:36] reliantt_: @JDXL yea in early 3.0 no car could do that
[6:06:48] benskeletor: they hit like 190 uphill
[6:06:51] benskeletor: when they first tested it
[6:06:51] gigamex: omE
[6:07:03] reliantt_: @benskeletor yea i saw that omE
[6:07:18] benskeletor: if they get a bump uphill
[6:07:21] benskeletor: you can def hit 200
[6:07:25] reliantt_: if you get chased be prepared for a nerf PepeLa
[6:07:31] feuha: CatDrive <-- you in chase
[6:07:31] Chufa: you crash u doid
[6:07:41] gigamex: I would
[6:07:41] JDXL: no they cant
[6:07:41] reliantt_: Hmm
[6:07:43] gigamex: o
[6:07:51] reliantt_: i heard cops make alot of money
[6:07:52] JDXL: but their cars stock are already good
[6:07:54] reliantt_: dk if thats true
[6:08:10] gigamex: so they're just perma nerfed or do they got a speedy interceptor?
[6:08:22] benskeletor: they will definitely get better cars later on
[6:08:24] feuha: Catting
[6:08:26] benskeletor: like they did in 3.0
[6:08:27] reliantt_: @benskeletor 100%
[6:08:30] JDXL: they are nerfed rn cuz its still early stage
[6:08:31] reliantt_: cops can never be weaker
[6:08:34] JDXL: its like phase 1 np
[6:08:43] sub_wrx2004: @gigamex they got a interceptor
[6:08:43] reliantt_: @JDXL YEP
[6:09:09] reliantt_: phase 2 will be like banks tuner shop i assume
[6:09:18] reliantt_: idk if they are gonna do tuner shop since no gtawg
