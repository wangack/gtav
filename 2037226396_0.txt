[1:59:34] AblazeValk: @eOV3RDRIVE will take over streaming for sure
[1:59:54] hghwalk: Wait
[1:59:54] StreamElements: Wait, what? WaitWhat
[1:59:55] Schleten_: Apex is bult on and old modded source engine. The audio will NEVER improve. They would have to recode the whole game. So your hopes are for Apex 2 and its being on a new engine
[2:00:03] RenOfficially: also the coms in gta are way better
[2:00:06] Set2nite_: coffee time
[2:00:10] eOV3RDRIVE: @AblazeValk every stream for the first few months will be playing GTA 6 no cap
[2:00:16] hghwalk: GTA devs bought out Nopixel devs so i think GTA6 will incorporate this??
[2:00:17] eOV3RDRIVE: every streamer
[2:00:17] StreamElements: Ads are automatically run and support the stream, to view with an Ad free experience you can subscribe to the stream or twitch turbo. See you in  1 min 30 secs! :)
[2:00:35] hghwalk: That would be SICKK
[2:00:37] Clodhoppr: dew it
[2:00:44] rhubarb23: Find a lot of circuit boards? LUL
[2:00:45] crazyiitopii: I caught Vee grinding while I watched AK yesterday LUL
[2:00:52] Set2nite_: your way ahead of me. top of the morning to yah.
[2:00:54] eOV3RDRIVE: you can also be Cab driver
[2:00:58] eOV3RDRIVE: LUL GunRun
[2:01:18] crazyiitopii: He is an admin btw LUL
[2:01:25] lowestnewt: what lvl sani r u at now @Acie ? DinoDance
[2:01:25] Schleten_: PC is the minority gaming platform. So Rockstar focus where the money is. So they make the game for console first then PC as usual
[2:01:40] lowestnewt: nice <3 DinoDance
[2:01:58] vinamra0104: BRIEEE HOW ARE YOUUUU
[2:02:02] RenOfficially: @lowestnewt 48 at the beginning of the day unsure right now
[2:02:06] vinamra0104: Its been a while

[2:02:19] Matt__xv: a year??
[2:02:21] Matt__xv: breh
[2:02:21] Itnatron: Itnatron subscribed with Prime. 
[2:02:27] JsonRL: @Schleten_ i mean from google, 2022 stats,  PC generated almost twice the market sales as console in  the gaming market
[2:02:33] estupidhigh: buying pa
[2:02:34] SWALICK: more like 2
[2:02:41] Clodhoppr: with how RP has exploded who actually knows tho
[2:02:43] hydrophoeniix: i read 2 years
[2:02:43] JsonRL: but I think what it gets rockstar is people buy the game on both
[2:02:50] estupidhigh: buying ps5 just for gta
[2:02:53] RenOfficially: probs 2027-28 because rockstar has to allow the game to be modded
[2:02:53] somarfps: A year
[2:02:53] crazyiitopii: Unfortunately its been closer to 2 years
[2:02:53] Leafdroid: gta 5 took 2 years to come to pc
[2:02:57] lowestnewt: yh i saw 2
[2:02:57] Ghost___91: no 1
[2:02:59] HandofOdd: Yeah that's traditionally how Rockstar games happen
[2:03:05] Webb903: It’s the I heard it’s dropping on pc at the same time now
[2:03:05] SickDoggz: yeah it took RDR a while to hit PC
[2:03:06] RenOfficially: so people buy shark cards
[2:03:06] hghwalk: Well rockstar acquired the people who do the mods
[2:03:07] SWALICK: @JsonRL yeah, pc is def not minority LUL
[2:03:10] 7iN6: @Leafdroid 1
[2:03:12] Mimick08: Thats what happened with gta5 but hopefully they release it everywhere at the same time who knows'
[2:03:12] technicalbg: work and travel
[2:03:17] SWALICK: its the exclusive contract with sony
[2:03:22] RenOfficially: shark cards
[2:03:25] hghwalk: So it will definitely be uncharted territory
[2:03:28] pandamercc: They love console apparently
[2:03:28] vinamra0104: You look really beautiful Brie acieBOUNCE
[2:03:28] eOV3RDRIVE: Probably so they can sell more Consoles and have a deal with Sony and Microsoft
[2:03:30] lowestnewt: my brother has a console so i will probably be able to play it on both
[2:03:31] crazyiitopii: Wouldn't shit ya you are our favorite turd LUL
[2:03:34] SebasBP28: in
[2:03:42] drgreenthumbz: Rockstar is expecting to release it on q1 of 2026
[2:03:42] chatty_patty93: Noooo, There was an official announcement gta 6 is coming to PC 1 year after console
[2:03:46] SebasBP28: reverse kill her
[2:03:49] SWALICK: well look at red dead, gta v and 4 i think @Acie
[2:03:49] ThrownStone: Consoles are also easier to debug because they are all exactly the same.
[2:03:51] technicalbg: The risks od work and travel
[2:03:54] RenOfficially: @greendealer01 that’s done tho now right?
[2:03:56] drgreenthumbz: for pc, that is given no push backs
[2:03:56] Leafdroid: @7iN6 came out in september 2013, came to pc in april 2015
[2:03:57] AblazeValk: apparently is healthy for the console community
[2:04:00] SebasBP28: and throw him from the truck gta style
[2:04:01] fixer_18: It's hard to optimize such a huge game for both. This is always the less stressful path for devs
[2:04:07] HoldMyGrenade: you all are down bad
[2:04:10] Clodhoppr: this the broke body squad
[2:04:11] TeamLiquid: Break Through Your Game with the new Alienware Pro Wireless Mouse and Keyboard!  go.adv.gg/MYb9c_
[2:04:13] SebasBP28: Proffesional Dumper
[2:04:16] Schleten_: @JsonRL Maybe it have changed last years. It's possible. BUT you have Game pass and playstation plus. So people that use the subscription services can't be counted you know
[2:04:17] SebasBP28: peepoGiggles
[2:04:23] SebasBP28: KEKW
[2:04:25] SebasBP28: KEKLEO
[2:04:31] somarfps: I believe an ex rockstar employee explain why it takes a year for PC
[2:04:32] chaosunleashed999: your team is injury prone LUL LUL
[2:04:34] SebasBP28: yeah Vee JJ take the wheel
[2:04:35] SWALICK: @RenOfficially wdym? Hmm
[2:04:36] Set2nite_: lol my sister is too lol
[2:04:56] chamblow: aint no way gta come 1 year later on pc that would be the worst business decision ever made in gaming history. made sense for the last. but not now that all this roleplay content and hype goes on
[2:05:00] Clodhoppr: trixie?
[2:05:07] vanzkie21: trixie?
[2:05:19] RenOfficially: Sony, Microsoft agreed to no more exclusivity contracts
[2:05:20] vinamra0104: THAT ASS ON UR CHARACTER......
[2:05:26] drvinnie_boombat: @chamblow that's the way its always been
[2:05:27] RenOfficially: @greendealer01
[2:05:38] SWALICK: @chamblow they don't make money off the roleplay stuff tho LUL
[2:05:44] technicalbg: dude one handedly picks a file cabinet
[2:05:50] chamblow: @drvinnie_boombat yes but before everyone was on console and twitch wasnt a thing
[2:05:50] pperik: HUH
[2:05:57] SWALICK: @chamblow and trust me sony pay big money y for that
[2:06:00] invisuz: is he working his glutes or his butt on leg day
[2:06:02] chamblow: @GreenDealer01 you would think so
[2:06:02] drgreenthumbz: @chamblow its licensing bro, has everything to do with Playstation paying for exclusive rights to have the game first because they pay for it
[2:06:04] Set2nite_: lmao I thought my son was playing this game to learn but he was just robbing everything. I was like what the.
[2:06:16] chamblow: fak sony then
[2:06:17] lowestnewt: i hate sony honestly man
[2:06:17] Leafdroid: @chamblow it would be one of the best business decisions for them if the consoles pay them to hold off for pc release, they would get BIG money for that
[2:06:21] hghwalk: Sony might be willing to compromise because of this situation
[2:06:24] zxuae: vee could be on the playboy front page.  ong no cap
[2:06:26] SWALICK: yup
[2:06:29] lowestnewt: so annoying
[2:06:32] LouievHD: why ur character so cheeked up XD
[2:06:36] llDEMiSE_ll: yeah pc wasnt a big thing back theen5
[2:06:43] RevillianGG: gotta capitalize on that hype
[2:06:44] Schleten_: The future is also subscription services for games. I bet in a few years there's gonna be 5 different levels of Game Pass and Playstation plus.
[2:06:46] simszszy: PogChamp
[2:06:46] ThrownStone: It brings replay-ability
[2:06:46] hghwalk: Idk proper hype generates assloads of money
[2:06:50] invisuz: people let money act for them
[2:06:51] chamblow: @Leafdroid what iof half of the potential buyers dont buy because of this ?
[2:06:53] technicalbg: it's honest money
[2:06:54] vinamra0104: Imma prep fo rthe exam and be back in an hour... SEE YAAAAA <3
[2:07:21] Schleten_: Didn't Rockstar invest in FiveM?
[2:07:27] chamblow: because im sure aint buying it if it comes 1 year later... means i would know the lore and shit its useless then
[2:07:51] Leafdroid: @chamblow theyll buy it eventually regardless unless it ends up being a dumpster fire
[2:07:56] SWALICK: @chamblow you would tho LULW
[2:08:04] crazyiitopii: @schleten_ ya they were tired of missing out on all this extra money on RP servers haha

[2:09:41] Schleten_: @crazyiitopii I mean even if they have a bad rumour from employees they're still kinda good to us gamers with games. So the mod options and actually how much stuff from main game you can do in RP probably will be good for it
[2:09:42] SebasBP28: thelulu NODDERS

[2:12:35] crazyiitopii: @schleten_ ya I mean no big company are actual saints when it comes down to it. I think Rockstar did a good job to make a game that's played 10 years layer. They just realized how much money finally they were missing out with these private servers. Then they swallowed up the little guys, classic capitalism LUL
[2:12:36] Ginoveli: mornin

[2:35:03] crazyiitopii: All these other big RP players are doing it @acie
[2:35:07] Schleten_: I would suggest if you want to put in the work or have someone doing it for you. One channel for VOD's and one for highlights. The VOD is no cutting or editing.
[2:35:10] xEclipseJx: I’ll still watch them lol
[2:35:11] TeamLiquid: Break Through Your Game with the new Alienware Pro Wireless Mouse and Keyboard!  go.adv.gg/MYb9c_

[2:37:32] SebasBP28: AYOOO

[2:37:46] Mimick08: Yeah you can speed up on twitch
[2:38:04] Clodhoppr: fast as fuck boii
[2:38:15] Schleten_: One of the reasons a lot of big ones moved to Youtube is that they VOD instantly get uploaded after they end stream. AND all people that watched during that stream counts as viewers on that video as default. So basically they make money of the vod during the stream
[2:38:16] SSGHaseeb: watching on youtube is smoother then twitch acieYAS
[2:39:06] Clodhoppr: you're on a car
[2:39:06] itsxNeo: @schleten_ I think they moved because of the bag they got LUL not bc of the vods
[2:39:10] CRlCK: ya my stream also freezes a lot so i have to refresh like 90 times a day
[2:39:15] SWALICK: lot of big ones moved to Youtube because of 💰 PepeLaugh

[2:40:36] CRlCK: it is
[2:40:39] TheButcherLIVE: i can see it ok though
[2:40:46] CRlCK: on everyone's stream&
[2:40:56] Schleten_: @itsxNeo well kinda both. The bag and they had already started a foundation on youtube with videos from their streams on Twitch. So even if half of the people followed they would still make bigger bank
[2:41:28] HandofOdd: Freya lets gooo
