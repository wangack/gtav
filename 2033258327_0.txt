[2:06:49] krepana: @jay_jaymann anyone can
[2:07:24] realitijd24: its better that it happens early
[2:07:29] jay_jaymann: wow they are a massive liability then with everyone having there houses as the main stash
[2:07:37] NemisizZ: def
[2:07:49] NemisizZ: problem is just ppl dont want that type of drama i think
[2:07:54] NemisizZ: so they try to avoid it
[2:08:16] spoonfullofMusic: hear me out: you steal a guys key, put a new lock on their door, make them pay for access to their own house (if its possible tho) KEKW
[2:08:18] ky05uk3: OMEGALUL
[2:08:23] infectious37: ok
[2:08:59] jay_jaymann: I’m think only the owner of a house can change the lock
[2:08:59] NemisizZ: prices is just... whack... makes no sense a key cost what it does
[2:09:33] krepana: @spoonfullofMusic i don't think that's possible because there can only be one owner
[2:09:45] NemisizZ: same with the racks, like we are talking about 4-5 wooden beams or sticks, and ppl charge like an arm and a leg for it, its wood and a few rusty nails

[2:10:51] Nightbot: check out my merch at https://dotexe.com/collections/travpiper
[2:11:02] NemisizZ: yeah i mean i get that, its just... it doesnt really make no sense in my head that something like that should cost that much, but on the other hand, economy is already running wild and is already overly inflated
[2:11:15] jay_jaymann: pricing on everything at the moment appears to be to stop hyper inflation
[2:11:34] ky05uk3: GrinderW
[2:12:04] NemisizZ: should put a limitation on that for that exact reason, so it wouldnt matter if your on 4hrs or 20hrs a day
[2:12:11] spoonfullofMusic: they want to be ahead for the first time deals
[2:12:23] krepana: buy 800 dollars for one hour of doctor is wild
[2:12:29] realitijd24: yea its gonna be interesting when guns gonna show up LUL
[2:12:35] meego0o: some groups are like this.. need to be the first
[2:12:49] jay_jaymann: yea that’s what I found in 3.0 it forces you to grind and the people who just want to rp can’t afford to survive
[2:13:00] NemisizZ: a fucking crowbar, like how much was it they wanted for that? 20k... its a fucking crowbar
[2:13:12] ky05uk3: Vinny is the best
[2:13:30] spoonfullofMusic: its smart on vinnys end, make money EZ
[2:13:37] infectious37: a race to the top
[2:13:39] NemisizZ: i feel its taking advantage of mechanics tbh, basically powergaming in a way
[2:13:56] spoonfullofMusic: its business, if you own a monopoly you will abuse it
[2:14:10] realitijd24: vinny just made a smart business deal
[2:14:28] meego0o: ppl sold their parts to 4head marty etc for abit cheaper and that was the buisness
[2:14:46] jay_jaymann: yea true, it got bad in 3.0 when meals were 1k though
[2:15:00] NemisizZ: just dont feel it makes or add much to the overall picture when its like that, but it is like that because its locked behind a mechanic
[2:15:41] spoonfullofMusic: @NemisizZ how is it locked tho, everyone can get the blueprint
[2:15:44] NemisizZ: like technically u could use a steel rod or whatever to pry with... but because there is no mechanic to back that up, then a crowbar costs 20k
[2:15:57] meego0o: "rob"
