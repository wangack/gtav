[0:39:16] JDXL: omE
[0:39:21] adzse: In July 1518, residents of the city of Strasbourg were struck by a sudden and seemingly uncontrollable urge to dance. The hysteria kicked off when a woman known as Frau Troffea stepped into the street and began to dance. This escalated for nearly two months where more than 400 people where dancing without rest to the point of dying of strokes and heart attacks. The strange episode ended when the dancers were taken away to a mountaintop shrine to pray for absolution.
[0:39:25] adzse: The explanation most likely concerns St. Vitus, a Catholic saint who 16th-century Europeans believed had the power to curse people with a dancing plague, this St. Vitus superstition may have triggered a stress-induced hysteria that took hold of much of the city. Although there is no solid proof for what actually caused this Dancing Plague. dizzTHINK
