[3:00:58] buddha_hands: I remember when that was also true in 3.0 Despairge
[3:00:59] Xastin3: so in 5.0
[3:00:59] jollypnda: if your talking about chain of command stuff, 100 percent one person can fuck it up royally
[3:01:00] TheTourist_: in august
[3:01:01] Matrix8369: all I could say is I dont envy the ppl that have to enforce/make those desisions. Having to deal with chatters through all this has to be rough.
[3:01:02] cmnylHD: There is a disconnect. Obviously. But that’s natural. I think a PD based on individual egos is bound to collapse
[3:01:03] lora1969: saabC in august COPIUM
[3:01:04] Eddie1225: cant wait for al saabs return to buddha yelling at him instead of the mayor

[3:01:16] newEnnui: :)
[3:01:19] Bluntblower_508: I can see you as a crim
[3:01:21] Hibob222: @Ssaab i dont mean to talk ooc and stuff but there's a charterer Richard stiffy who has been waiting months now to hear anything to become pd so i guess my question is there still hope for people waiting that long are they even being considered still?
[3:01:22] Tackelss: rumor has it slacks is going to cg lol
[3:01:25] limerick2018: I hope your crim try’s with a new group

[3:01:35] duranggo: @CxurveMC that's optimistic, not even GTA releases that slow
[3:01:39] Artsii1994: Saab going back asking what happened to the meth operation and such
[3:01:40] cmnylHD: Crim is boring. Be a character. Be an individual. Be a Randall, an Abdul. Don’t be a boring Mr K
[3:01:40] galaxy21212121: best tip to join no pixel?
[3:01:47] jetstargirls: I was going to say the officers from 3.0 to 4.0 have been really good with what they haven't learnt within 3.0 and to build a decent police department because of it
[3:01:47] Artsii1994: Do a habibi gang
[3:01:48] Nickknows: turn slacks into a crim that would be fire
[3:01:53] qHaydos: yeah but ur gonna be too late to the party
[3:01:57] jsplash5: i don’t remember how leanbois ended
[3:01:59] jayrod1221: anyone that’s ok with taking an L in rp is a win for rp

[3:02:07] galaxy21212121: Captain suits you
[3:02:11] doza107: take over civ gang
[3:02:11] redandra: There are a handful of people who loudly disagree with anything leadership does because they want power.
[3:02:12] abcskydragon96: Join CG lol
[3:02:12] Artsii1994: Like i was thinking the idea of you having your own gang

[3:02:40] buddha_hands: saab works fine at the top of the chain but could definitely use a communicator between him & everyone else a lot of times OMEGALAUGHING
[3:02:40] rajenfoodles: AL Saab committing to something BOOBAPEEK
[3:02:41] robertsmithjr: robertsmithjr subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! i think having a chief would galvanize the 3 captains and keep everyone working towards  they same goal and help keep consistency between the 3 captains
[3:02:41] BooGieDownbx: baller gang
[3:02:47] ravfan20: I can't wait to see you play criminal
[3:02:48] jersey_jesus: Is he gonna be a G6 or Grime guy? Hmmm
[3:02:51] cmnylHD: Gangs? Big Ego Crims? I hate that. I hate it. Be a civ with a mission
[3:02:56] galaxy21212121: U SHOULD BE COMMISSIONER
[3:02:56] hat_thebutcher: Slacks in "PD" by that I mean Andi and Sizz's gang axaxaxa
[3:02:58] itisnikhil: unfortunately slacks and max will becme friends and max will promote you to commissioner. You cannot escape this position
[3:03:00] iSoulRay: whos got the marshmallo what we doin

[3:03:21] cmnylHD: @bandito_o7 I find him boring. I don't enjoy the content, personal opinion is all. Nothing against the streamer or anything
[3:03:25] Bluntblower_508: Oh shit, imagine if you stole LASO from Cletus to see if he'd go crim
[3:03:31] robertsmithjr: true
[3:03:31] jersey_jesus: On God NODDERS
[3:03:31] bart_ruckel: prolly will happen imo
[3:03:33] galaxy21212121: Do you think you can handle being commissioner?
[3:03:33] Drkdream: PauseChamp
[3:03:37] jetstargirls: I can see what you achieved in 3.0 coming across from the officers into 4.0 and how they understand what is required of them. I mean they still need some polishing
[3:03:38] lightstormclaw: whats going on? why are cops on hills and stuff
[3:03:38] dakota22446: Hmmm
[3:03:40] cmnylHD: You'll stop drinking too?
[3:03:42] Cyrical: What position do you see Slacks in?
[3:03:42] redandra: Terrible idea
[3:03:43] buddha_hands: @Eddie1225 lang seemed more accepting when he wasn't fuckin shit up every time OMEGALAUGHING
[3:03:44] Alexqc19: Nah
[3:03:47] Baasto: which gang will wipe the PD first in 4.0 ?
[3:03:47] duck_puck1: YEEE
[3:03:47] Drkdream: HmmCouncil
[3:03:48] cmnylHD: Kappa
[3:03:50] zabaloo: but what if the legislation says otherwise
[3:03:51] Zwanzinger: should have an investigator position, for cornwood
[3:03:54] bandito_o7: @cmnylHD I respect that
[3:03:57] Alexqc19: Terible idea
[3:03:58] IcyyMike: how did slacks end up getting their radio frequency?
[3:03:59] ScyThE619: what is the difference of chief of police and commissioner
[3:03:59] mrfelixgo: what about chief posiition
[3:04:02] Eddie1225: @buddha_hands OMEGALAUGHING
[3:04:03] dakota22446: I say fire all of the captains cause I dislike them
[3:04:05] Keeper24: Keeper24 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[3:04:07] galaxy21212121: ask the state for help
[3:04:09] ViewbotReportingforDuty: RP wise, change is 50/50 good. Depends on how people handle the RP
[3:04:10] BulletGorilla: Wasnt that the plan anyway
[3:04:11] Aces_o: so sgts aren't high command then?
[3:04:12] cmnylHD: Why do YOU feel you have to fix it?
[3:04:12] postAmongUsist: i dont think chief/comiss will change shit, just a new face to yell at KEKW
[3:04:12] qHaydos: no way those captains should be above some of those snrs tho
[3:04:16] duck_puck1: establishing a true commander is the key role imo
[3:04:16] buddha_hands: there have been plenty of times in the past where PD has *needed* HC oversight, but this is not one of those times lol
[3:04:17] Eddie1225: yea this is how i know people dont know about 3.0 PD
[3:04:17] ViewbotReportingforDuty: Just play along with it
[3:04:18] giorgiotodoroki: Kappa
[3:04:19] rjoconnor: i think LT's for each shift move caps down to LT
[3:04:19] riftshadow: Correct it needs order the buck must stop with someone.
[3:04:19] JonnyDestin: is Richard on twitch?
[3:04:20] Eddie1225: they had to many cooks
[3:04:24] quasarptolemy: @dakota22446 true, leadership and authority bad
[3:04:25] Eddie1225: and it fucked things up
[3:04:25] Eddie1225: OMEGALAUGHING
[3:04:27] StreamElements: Please do not meta in chat, which means do not tell Saab stuff happening in RP that his character would otherwise not know.
[3:04:27] usn_orion: 3 comissioners kekw
[3:04:29] zabaloo: you need a lobbyist
[3:04:29] m_mcgarder: high command needs an overruler
[3:04:30] TheTourist_: please piss of max again i'm frightened he likes slacks too much and will make him commissioner. i'm worried for eddie's health if that happens.
[3:04:31] jersey_jesus: The only voice that matters is the mayor NODDERS
[3:04:32] WildWillie419: Slacks just wants to patrol more KEKL
[3:04:36] ZPanda_MS: Overall it seems like the captains feel like they have to hold everything together on their own, and its leading them to not have faith that their officers don't have good intentions behind their mistakes
[3:04:37] dakota22446: too late bud
[3:04:37] slausonnipcno: Too many grounds being stood on  you right!!!
[3:04:37] Drkdream: axell
[3:04:40] hopalong92: I wanna see slacks as a crim
[3:04:40] limerick2018: You could step down willingly if you want
[3:04:45] wankejj: have 1 comiss then 4 captians and have comiss make final call on ties
[3:04:47] JAYYCRKS: ahhhh my mind
[3:04:47] Bluntblower_508: Too many leaders, not enough soldiers
[3:04:48] Aces_o: @TheTourist_ trueeee
[3:04:48] dakota22446: I got 30 streamables already
[3:04:48] infintitedream: Slacks still might be commish
[3:04:50] cmnylHD: You shouldn't have to give disclaimers lmao
[3:04:51] lora1969: TheTourist_ saabKEK
[3:04:51] charging_badger: clip it and ship it

[3:04:59] iSoulRay: its okay your the best cop in the city
[3:05:00] Count_Brennuvarg: @Ssaab Weirdge everyone knows youre the most power hungry cop, hell, even the most power hungry player on no pixel. Dont try to hide it
[3:05:00] ViewbotReportingforDuty: Yeah just play along with RP man
[3:05:00] zabaloo: hire a lobbyist
[3:05:02] cmnylHD: And you're a little tipsy. We get it
[3:05:03] fmancilla0730: clips ready
[3:05:05] ViewbotReportingforDuty: whatever happens, happens
[3:05:08] cmnylHD: 🙂
[3:05:10] jetstargirls: ok your wife is the PD
[3:05:10] Xclka_: conan clarkson for commissioner
[3:05:10] layla109: Honestly, I think PD needs Slacks at this point in time if they want to retain an amount of consistency.
[3:05:11] RANKKAyoni: oh you wont
[3:05:12] slausonnipcno: No you good we realize Slacks aint the one!!
[3:05:18] riftshadow: Its going to suck being in charge of the PD
[3:05:18] Aces_o: Would Slacks accept or would he decline?
[3:05:20] Cyrical: Do you even have enough Time OOC to do it?
[3:05:21] ViewbotReportingforDuty: It's ok
[3:05:22] sevens777s: @Ssaab there needs to be a moral check see who is bringing it down on the regular
[3:05:23] ViewbotReportingforDuty: Not your choice
[3:05:24] dakota22446: SAVEME
[3:05:25] Kahr102: feels bad for slacks man
[3:05:27] vickyrei: DAYYY ONE
[3:05:30] Xastin3: the guy that doesnt want it usually one gets it
[3:05:30] NEET_In_Progress: DAAYY ONE
[3:05:31] ViewbotReportingforDuty: The mayor wont force anyone to be commissioner
[3:05:33] jersey_jesus: Divine already did it Kappa
[3:05:34] galaxy21212121: whats the point of being PD if u dont grind for the highest power?
[3:05:35] layla109: Sounds like something Max would do tbh.
[3:05:36] ZPanda_MS: I vote for Mcnutly to be commissioner
[3:05:36] cmnylHD: Lets talk about Ssaab. Tell us a fun fact lol

[3:05:40] iSoulRay: saab the type of cop to make me go legal
[3:05:42] Matrix8369: DAY ONE
[3:05:44] splater4: would slacks refuse?
[3:05:47] Artsii1994: Would you put your name in the hat or just nit put your name at all
[3:05:47] Wolf_Of_The_Resistance: Flop for commissioner
[3:05:47] WildWillie419: I think people just complain about the 3 captains because 2 of them tend to vote stricter than Slacks. If it was one strict person in charge, I’m not sure much changes
[3:05:48] Cyrical: How do you feel about the people that think Duncan should be Commissioner LOL
[3:05:49] buddha_hands: do you think Xice would have the will for it+time+ability to shift his schedule if he were selected?
[3:05:52] ViewbotReportingforDuty: It takes hella big responsibilities
[3:05:52] iSoulRay: mangooo babyy
[3:05:54] Soul_frozen: 4th time the charm
[3:05:55] Selosya: Mango is the best
[3:05:55] jetstargirls: Yasss!!!!!
[3:05:56] Eddie1225: if slacks becomes commish im packing my bags and becoming a full time alinity watcher
[3:05:57] limerick2018: I really want to see someone different as I want to see a more laid back slacks on Patrol
[3:05:57] cmnylHD: LMAO
[3:05:58] dakota22446: if you get commish just clap someone day one and get fired
[3:05:58] Eddie1225: EZ
[3:05:58] ScyThE619: mangoes are fire
[3:05:59] dholdren12: i honestly do not think that any of the captains will be chosen as comissioner
[3:05:59] vickyrei: mango with tajin tho

[3:06:04] sevens777s: @Ssaab you're a mango sir
[3:06:05] ChiefZBP: Your gonna want to look throught the binos
[3:06:06] Chaos_91: mango is so goosd
[3:06:06] jersey_jesus: saabWiggle mango
[3:06:06] itsNudeGrandpa: Honestly, the best choice for commissioner is Bobby Charles. I think anybody who says otherwise is an idiot
[3:06:06] tonal_airsoft: peepoSipSpin
[3:06:07] Dizley: Dude a mango peach smoothie is insane
[3:06:07] m_mcgarder: papaya better
[3:06:07] Bluntblower_508: Why do you have to say disclaimer? Is it against the rules of nopixel to talk to your chat about your rp? Or is it because people can get too spicy
[3:06:08] Saaulty: I LOVE U SAAB
[3:06:08] BladesofICE: yea mangoes are the best
[3:06:11] stradam_: Mangos is s tier
[3:06:11] Artsii1994: Mangos are good and sweet
[3:06:11] vasuba: Only thing people really need to understand is the person at the top is going to become a desk jockey. If they love their action cop they dotn want them being pushed to the top
[3:06:11] jellonaut: Why? Cuz they're delicious duh
[3:06:13] giorgiotodoroki: slurpin mangoes demon style
[3:06:15] GustavoK___: cornwood has a dolphin OMEGALAUGHING
[3:06:15] Purecrew: Doesnt Slacks have more of a appease everyone approach how would he handle unchecked power over PD?
[3:06:16] SoullessSleeper: I love buying dried mango
[3:06:17] wethenorth_canada: Funny Mr K does too
[3:06:18] TheGodmother: mango with tajin NODDERS
[3:06:18] Eddie1225: big pussy commish mhm
[3:06:20] stonedmikey: you know what tastes like mangos right? @Ssaab
[3:06:20] prinniciodeltoro: have you had different variations of mangoes @Ssaab ? pineapple mangoes?
[3:06:20] ScyThE619: you ever eaten mango chutney?
[3:06:20] Bluntblower_508: I love kale mango smoothies!
[3:06:23] memo__foo: mango with tajin 🔥
[3:06:24] cmnylHD: Pineapple and mango together, sublime
[3:06:25] psicosmoker1979: i dont like either too many snakes on the PD
[3:06:25] TheTourist_: lies, we've been waiting 4 years for another mango stream with kiwi and madge FeelsBadMan
[3:06:29] dakota22446: TRUEING twisted
[3:06:33] Wolf_Of_The_Resistance: I love mango flavored stuff but I don't like mangos themselves
[3:06:33] buddha_hands: owen commissioner would go so fucking hard
[3:06:35] Drkdream: HACKERMANS
[3:06:37] riftshadow: The Commissioner's role is all bureaucracy and BS all day long.
[3:06:37] vasuba: its all scripted afterall
[3:06:37] dakota22446: Sadeg AoD
[3:06:38] will_ball: mango lassi's slap
[3:06:39] robertsmithjr: i honestly think you have to have someone in charge of each shift captain, lt whatever, because no chief or commissioner can give equal time and attention to all 3 shifts, having someone in each shift could bring to the captain, lt whatever to chief or commissioner
[3:06:39] SoullessSleeper: mango strawberry the best
[3:06:39] vickyrei: @memo__foo exaaaactly
[3:06:41] jetstargirls: Are mangoes popular where you live? Aussie has tones of mangoes
[3:06:43] layla109: @WildWillie419 Exactly. People think having one power will change things when it won't. It might make things worse. 2 or more heads are better than one.
[3:06:44] millzeebb: Somehow malton ends up commish
[3:06:50] gonzogaminggtav: The one thing i have learned in RP is never say no always just role with it!
[3:06:52] Baffty: wait youre high command?!
[3:06:53] Cyrical: Does Ssaab do Relationship RP? Just Curious
[3:06:56] cmnylHD: Oh don't get me started on those people who blow things out of proportion. It's petty eh? We get you
[3:07:00] infintitedream: I do like when the streamer does disclaim it though
[3:07:03] konsabby: Hoppers not understanding how corrupt cop RP works... sad

[3:07:12] dakota22446: could’ve married honey buns Sadge
[3:07:20] Cyrical: Does she play NoPixel?
[3:07:21] kittytaiyo: Question @Ssaab. There still would be a problem being commissioner with putting up a united front right? If you go against the captains they might lost the trust of their subordinates.
[3:07:22] dakota22446: LMAO

[5:31:54] stradam_: not a bad idea
[5:31:56] imationRip: @Eddie1225 could we get an "A B S O L U T E L Y" counter?
[5:32:03] stellarnaut: reception for sure
[5:32:06] layla109: Guys taking ideas he learned with Flop and relaying them. This is good.
[5:32:07] jbronee: an unarmed cop at burger shop
[5:32:09] taraannee: when i got promoted i was so hype i got to wear service dress blues man, even diff uniform options are fun
[5:32:11] ArdentCause: @speedpax exactly, you need a leader in positions to allow others to have guidance, you can't have 1 captain be split in 40 different directions
[5:32:11] psicosmoker1979: i love this RP but it feels like theres too much behins the scenes that stall lot of things
[5:32:15] jollypnda: @speedpax true but there needs to be a consistent baseline
[5:32:17] Elektroza: actually huge ideas

[5:33:28] sspungg: all this sounds good an is about to happen stuff is starting to heat up there is your guy at snr buns
[5:33:37] stellarnaut: 500 dollars an hour is killing the budget KEKW

[5:34:14] Swisskeey: get cornwood onto it, he'll have it done in 24hrs
[5:34:14] jollypnda: I mean have them help write reports, this would lower the work load on people and allow them to be patrolling more often
[5:34:15] Leritt: @stellarnaut I think someone said City started with 2Mil Budget they are at like 15mil rn so idea that theres no money is crazy
[5:34:25] layla109: imagine the poor Cadet that have to stay at Snr Buns. saabOwo
[5:34:37] imationRip: I think Max said it was at 38m
[5:34:41] stellarnaut: @Leritt im joking but i do understand slacks argument
[5:34:43] RobialT: @Leritt 30 M
[5:34:44] cavastyle: a cadet has to listen to duncan and write everything down
[5:34:46] ArdentCause: the fact that the "state budget for PD" is a thing seems so dumb tbh....
[5:34:53] AfroSasquatch: Love you Ssaab!!
[5:34:54] RonJon: you took a bunch to city hall that time
[5:34:56] Grenadebot1: maybe make all the cadets stay at snr buns xD

[5:35:01] ryanahmed1000: Have a different role and lower pay?
[5:35:02] psicosmoker1979: @Leritt server administrations
[5:35:13] ArdentCause: especially this early on, why wouldn't you just let it be unlimited so you can at least build a strong foundation
[5:35:14] Sparklepuffpony: they aint gonna learn anything in just 1 day a week
[5:35:19] buddha_hands: the last thing you'd want is a bunch of people becoming FTOs to get whatever privilege but when you look at their reports it's like duncan or 🌽
[5:35:22] JesusGVG: just cause there is money in the state budget doesnt mean its supposed to be used chat OMEGALAUGHING they need to think about the server economy
[5:35:28] stellarnaut: If the city wants cops on the streets they need to pay for it its that simple.

[5:35:45] sspungg: that would be good cuz there is your cop or what ever to be at snr buns watching helping an at the court house to keep a eye would be great an can work your way up
[5:35:48] Sswordplay: @ArdentCause It was for the first month or so, then the "Feds" pulled the plug. Issue is that budget management tools arent really available for the council to manage it
[5:35:48] Drkdream: monkaEyes

[5:36:15] jersey_jesus: The River incident monkaW

[5:46:32] JesusGVG: LMAO
[5:46:33] sspungg: swat should just be swat tho raids an finding drug bust

[6:02:58] layla109: @nickdrawsstuff It might be by design. PD needs more resources, numbers and equipment along with allotted time to play catch up unfortunately.
[6:02:59] neonsloths: @Bubbasage auditors

[6:05:09] Antonne15: First time chatter, just wanted to stop in and say that I've been loving the RP lately between you, Cornwood, the Mayor, and the rest of PD. The whole starting a new PD thing has been awesome and you guys have been killing it. Keep it up!
[6:05:12] buddha_hands: the treasurer has no problem sending more right? or thats what we hear..

[6:05:38] layla109: @RobialT I think you misunderstood. I never said the situation was good as is but speed running is definitely the fastest way to down the PD without ironing out the kinks properly.

[6:06:43] RobialT: @layla109 Hiring officers and actually having them stick around for more than a week shouldn't be called speed running
[6:06:46] surelyURjokingMrFeynman: mhm

[6:06:57] nickdrawsstuff: Why didn't they hire Ripley again?
[6:06:58] khrow: Sure thats gin
[6:06:58] lizardeyes: show
[6:07:01] vasuba: Hours served is an issue. Its alot easier for a cop who puts 14 hours a day to afford things then an officer who does a more normal 4-6 hours.
[6:07:08] Eddie1225: big pussy was the greatest criminal in 3.0
[6:07:22] ens0mniac: how can slacks tell people “we’ll look into it” if he starts delegating though?
[6:07:27] WentToBuyMilkAgain: @nickdrawsstuff he refused the offer and then insulted the pd or something
[6:07:28] warner05: @eddie1225 name bruh
[6:07:28] Blanketslol: @Tickls not my point, but ok. if a normal person works half the time as cornwood, they'd have half the money. Cornwood also spends everything on the PD and only just today spent $ on a car. do you also expect other officers to put their entire savings into the PD? they are down bad

[6:10:39] jollypnda: @dommeka if people are afraid to the point they aren’t fulfilling there duties they are allowed to preform then maybe that position isnt for them
[6:10:39] dakota22446: FarmerT

[6:13:21] Eddie1225: chat
[6:13:23] JC9R_: he meant they can create an academy and run it
[6:13:24] dommeka: Its a self inflicted bottleneck unfortunately
[6:13:24] layla109: @RobialT Speedrun = completing a goal/mission as fast as possible. Mistakes are made quicker that way. I didn't say that PD shouldn't pick up the pace but they shouldn't rush it.
[6:13:25] ens0mniac: this meeting is about why this shitty closet is the place that high command always meets

[8:27:14] RoswellUK: RoswellUK subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[8:27:21] Rare__Potato: Someone call out Duncan for not talking at all
[8:27:22] MXLXMXR: @danmac wrong
[8:27:24] JesusGVG: so his only question was to complain about this panel? OMEGALAUGHING
[8:27:34] dholdren12: that was honestly not horrible from cornwood
[8:27:39] pokefwends: did you end up letting out what the gist of the convo the other night with cornwood was?  meta shit aside
[8:27:53] raizzel_azzer: ask duncan please
[8:27:58] MakiWind: Maybe Nekoda could be a senior
[8:28:04] McCape7: Why is there WPM graph on the back
[8:28:26] seniorbunss: prob is if the officer in that shift has a problem with their own shift leader whos standing in front of them
[8:28:31] layla109: @MXLXMXR HUH The Mayor override a captains vote and voted for Slack's decision for corn to keep the job but demoted to PPO.
[8:28:37] mslukacola: Both takes are reasonable for the conversation methods, no hate from either side
[8:28:46] Rare__Potato: @McCape7 I think it's because Bones (Cazey OOC specifically) is really slow at typing OMEGALAUGHING
[8:28:48] taraannee: that’s actually a great question lmao
[8:28:52] Andrew0: @McCape7 prior to the meeting, bones tried to flex with 50 wpm
[8:28:54] petterseff: wth is going on i hear multiple people
[8:28:58] KaycasTV: @McCape7 brones was braggin about his 50 wpm then cornwood did that

[8:29:23] its_R4HUL: say it
[8:29:28] Count_Brennuvarg: Bad example: Cornwood marching down to PD because of the murder charge PepeLaugh
[8:29:33] Farmerr_: bones coming to you about his vest last night?
[8:29:37] GD_Rep: cornwood texting your mother as we speak @Ssaab
[8:29:37] MXLXMXR: @layla109 a suspended captain, correct
[8:29:38] focustft: @KaycasTV what's funnier is that website isn't as hard to get a good WPM - there's no punctuation or capitalization
[8:29:40] superbizarr0: xdd  "The Time Cornwood brought up moral issues a few weeks ago"   JK
[8:29:44] layla109: Duncan would murder slacks if the boner convo came up LUL

[8:29:55] magnets_: bro went right back to the phone KEKLEO
[8:29:57] cjohno20: Kinda telling that finding specifics is difficult. Maybe an official complaints/resolutions document should exist
[8:30:03] maestro__21: Man cornwood cant help himself
[8:30:05] JloRobbins: cornwood basically only has complaints recently I feel like, I think that just comes with the long and complicated past week or so and it’ll get better after a bit of time.
[8:30:10] ParashootTV: What if he just has the phone up to taunt you and isn't texting? LUL
[8:30:22] alexskater5027: @Count_Brennuvarg getting pressed for bs chargers by your own pd. when every laweyer says the case is complete trash lol....
[8:30:29] Ghostly_shadow12345: probably the issue where Duncan felt uncomfortable with ruby joking about him, and they eventually talked it our
[8:30:33] JesusGVG: OMEGALAUGHING 󠀀
[8:30:34] superbizarr0: LUL
[8:30:38] magnets_: KEKW

[8:31:00] peonthruster: Nah cornwood just complains 24/7
[8:31:01] stewchootrain: i just wish he had the tiniest bit of respect
[8:31:04] LokiStormbringer67: Good communication is not just complaining, it should also offer possible solutions
[8:31:07] thats_sweet5: give him Duncan’s number so they can both talk each others ear off
[8:31:11] DaymanF0TNM: @JloRobbins I sure hope so , because from what I've seen it look like he's progressively doing it more often
[8:31:14] pokefwends: ban phones in the briefing room when

[8:31:39] Flying_Floor: @LokiStormbringer67 tbh its not on an officer to offer solutions, is it?
[8:31:49] Cintr40: the best thing cornwood made happen was the seniors finally have a voice, are speaking and can vote for daps, this is good.
[8:31:51] condorplayz: what book is that
[8:32:02] Ryzen4000: what ya readin bud

[8:33:09] xstatik_rev: Cornwood monitoring that diah-bee-teas app on his phone. so chill chat.
[8:33:11] Count_Brennuvarg: So that's why you're such a fence sitter OMEGALAUGHING
[8:33:14] KissMyAsthma_69: I like Calista Bell, she's straight to the point and does a lot of police work
[8:33:14] IvyOlive: it’s just a bummer to know cornwood prob has a laundry list and isn’t saying anything
[8:33:15] maestro__21: Lmao, perfect to combat Cornwood
[8:33:19] alexskater5027: chat is clueless almost every shift 2/3 sr. is on cornwoods side.... they just have no clue whats actually happening

If he wants to be back in the PD then awesome but he has to stop hating everything about what the PD is doing. I feel like they’re obviously changing things and trying to be better

[8:55:44] buddha_hands: thats not exactly what the question was OMEGALAUGHING
[8:55:44] daniel01927291: slacks it’s qualified immunity if someone reasonable in your position would follow an order than your not at fault but if you shot someone with hands up your fucked
[8:55:47] randybobndyphone: I mean in real life who ever pulls the trigger is ay fault but
[8:55:56] TimmayHS: Mayor has unlimited power letsgoo
[8:55:59] CuIdra: Call judge crane he'd know
[8:56:02] bukighost: I read about some german speaking guys who were really insistent on the fact that "I was just following orders" was a viable defense. They seemed pretty swell.
[8:56:05] cjohno20: Wow most of the PD disagrees with Slacks
[8:56:08] eiyzen: both need follow up questions
[8:56:09] Eddie1225: my man rhodes
[8:56:10] Count_Brennuvarg: @Ssaab Imo giving the command "SHOOT THAT GUY", the officer shooting becomes the gun, the commanding officer is pulling his trigger and making him blow that load

[8:56:16] misanthropicace2569: you see something wrong as an officer you stop it and hold the responsible party accountable. Its not be complicit in the behavior by partaking in it knowing full well that youre not supposed to do it
[8:56:18] titanvol29: And he was running away. You shoot someone in the.back like that it's wrong
[8:56:18] RGB_V10: isn't that an issue tho OMEGALAUGHING
[8:56:19] evilmoose__: @tanksly Good point

[8:56:21] eiyzen: superiors are not be all and say all
[8:56:28] walkgleesh: you are right
[8:56:30] TimmayHS: anyone confused about the answer to this question should literally just call the mayor and talk to him about it
[8:56:36] BackStageDoor: dude, you’re right
[8:56:38] M__Wolfe: Its case by case dependent. If the guy has a gun and your SO says to shoot, you shoot and the burden is on your SO. But if theyre on their knees saying dont shoot then its on you
[8:56:40] misanthropicace2569: youre right NODDERS
[8:56:40] eiyzen: can trust someone on killing someoen lmao wth
[8:56:40] Skeletalgoose: Because you assume the commanding officer knows what they are doing
[8:56:41] superbizarr0: NODDERS Nuremberg defense
[8:56:52] cjohno20: It's a single CoC question, exactly
[8:56:55] eiyzen: you cant just assume they are doing the right order
[8:56:55] robertsmithjr: or not be a cop @TimmayHS
[8:56:57] DaymanF0TNM: yea but maybe there's context that you're missing out on that justifies them being shot no question
[8:56:59] RGB_V10: OMEGALAUGHING
[8:57:00] cjohno20: Laws > SOPS
[8:57:03] Beedle: In real life it depends on the city charter. Considering the legislation, Max would be considered a "strong mayor" vs a weak one in terms of their executive authority
[8:57:03] hawkeye69r: if you think this is the nuremberg defence you're missing the point
[8:57:03] chivvyy: the mayor is also not a trained officer

[8:57:40] nasarat_blast: Just give them one more for Sam baas and call it a day
[8:57:45] merlenderl: What if the situation is the commanding officer has knowledge the officer doesn't. How do you know when to listen or obey

[8:58:38] brute17: you dont
[8:58:39] hawkeye69r: talking about how you know they're the same person is changing the topic
[8:58:39] Lepaca: trust the scene lead
[8:58:41] BG2580: videya
[8:58:41] layla109: Following a chain of command to shoot someone can be used a cop out tbf if something goes wrong. The shooting officer could still get sued right?
[8:58:42] fraudiola9: becuase th pd offivcer says so ???
[8:58:43] MXLXMXR: i guess it's assuming the person they're ordered to shoot is that person
[8:58:43] M__Wolfe: You confirm back with the SO
[8:58:43] alexskater5027: @TheToxicBigFoot *based
[8:58:45] MAXATAK: based* TheToxicBigFoot
[8:58:46] CameronE1010: i guess that's the price of business
[8:58:47] Flying_Floor: Well you assume your CO knows its the same person before giving the command
[8:58:48] BattlefieldHEW: ask lenny what he would do in that scene
[8:58:48] Mith_NSNL: I mean you got a point for sure
[8:58:49] Chipset3: Actual brain dead take
[8:58:50] SARSling: Because this hypothetical situation was build like that.
[8:58:50] SeraphButterfly: I feel like it would be in the PD's best interest to educate and inform the Mayor of the SOPs like an officer so that you can have that faith.
[8:58:50] neutrofuji: Need to ask a judge this question imo
[8:58:52] JennyHell: LuvPeekR
[8:58:52] magnets_: so how does an officer have to see everything beginning to end before they take action?
[8:58:54] eiyzen: this is america cops, shoot first and ask later
[8:58:54] Ned15: It happened before where the wrong car got shot @ssaab
[8:58:55] TheToxicBigFoot: i misheard mb mb
[8:58:55] cjohno20: You've gotta hammer this home there's no way 90% of PD thinks that's ok lmao
[8:58:58] KingStephen03: it doesn’t matter. you have to follow chain of command no matter what
[8:59:01] nasarat_blast: This is a good question and scenario
[8:59:02] zandrusz: training should be to shoot first Kappa
[8:59:02] KingCarter: i think the answer here is you don’t immediately shoot take some time understand the situation
[8:59:03] ThronDon: just gotta stand on business
[8:59:05] hawkeye69r: @Ssaab literally no one is saying black out.
[8:59:06] Chrisychris1: you have to follow orders, once that order is given, you have a free pass right?
[8:59:08] zorahul: so unless syou personally see it you cant act
[8:59:09] superbizarr0: NODDERS what if the person giving the orders is entirely corrupt and evil aswell

[8:59:19] Spritzii: ASK LENNY WHAT HE THINKS IF MAYOR SAID TO SHOOT
[8:59:21] LucidShooter: @Chrisychris1 lol a free pass for murder
[8:59:22] KrazyWizardFox: Mindless Zombie Mode ACTIVATE!!! I'd follow chain of command too! Failing upwards works too often haha
[8:59:23] luckerooni: i think theres an assumption that someone telling you to shoot is putting their own badge on the line behind saying that as a superior which is why the mayor holding this power is awkward
[8:59:25] fraudiola9: i dont get what yor poit is , you are contracdicting lol
[8:59:29] Chrisychris1: then they get removed fast
[8:59:31] MAXATAK: that is such a dangerous statement
[8:59:32] buddha_hands: there's a lot of things that WOULD be breaking the law normally but not if your authority lawfully allows it, and whoever is giving the order is supposed to be trusted with their calls+information that you don't have
[8:59:33] icarusdjr: need to ask a prosecutor or judge about this
[8:59:33] MAXATAK: ahh
[8:59:37] mattchutt: slacks, if you say shoot, and you’re my higher up and obviously depending on the situation in front of me, im shooting
[8:59:37] dholdren12: it was no different the. what you did earlier commanding your officers to shoot those people at the wedding earlier
[8:59:41] eiyzen: everyone can have a bad day, why would you blindly listen to someone to kill another person
[8:59:45] Axcennts: peepoYell SHOOT THE DOG IT'S REACHING
[8:59:50] cjohno20: You need POSITIVE ID. It sucks but it is what it is

[9:01:29] FLORIDaPKER: this hypothetical isn't helping the trust and judgment of superior question
[9:01:30] superbizarr0: NODDERS  imagine if the person giving orders is corrupt and evil
[9:01:31] RGB_V10: mhm
[9:01:31] fraudiola9: because the scene lead knows wht he is doin ???
[9:01:32] Spritzii: command tells you you do it it’s on command not them
[9:01:33] walkgleesh: he wouldn't scene lead anyway. Just taking the space of other questions
[9:01:37] eiyzen: @mattchutt thats why its not always correct

[9:02:33] GDaddyCheech: Let crane talk
[9:02:34] Chrisychris1: scene lead needs to take the responsibility, they need to be calm etc, they have the training and not give that kinda bad order, but if they do give an order, it needs to be followed

[11:22:17] Luthercorpz: At least they can't blame the Mayor for not funding now like some were. lol
[11:22:18] IIIIHELLIIII: Probably @filthypickle
[11:22:21] TyMsup: its not really rp when theyre proposing changes the admins need to make

[11:24:37] Neiara__: It’s not driving them BACK to pd it’s getting TO the north in time
[11:24:38] Luthercorpz: @neiro025 I love you too <3
[11:24:40] robertsmithjr: you cant get funding, wheres the million plus to rebuild paleto, its still blown up from 3.0
[11:24:41] Pakkasparkers: this is why the pd is so far behind, the cock block themselves every time
[11:24:41] lookingfornothinghere: get more cops going and it will be a good idea
[11:24:42] Krimson07_: i hope cornwood gets his own department and takes his posse with him Prayge
[11:24:42] Neiara__: lol?
[11:24:43] KylianMfrappe: @kunkunkivet seriously there's no good reason other than worried about LASO which he has no reason to be
[11:24:43] TryAtomic: if only they heard what he said to the auditor about sandy LUL damn
[11:24:44] Decimated_exo: @owlx7 dont need you in chat
[11:24:44] Moregorilla: The mayor would be all about a ribbon cutting event for the opening lol
[11:24:46] Glitch3dGames: and youre wasting 5 10 mins that could be spent stopping other crimes
[11:24:47] daacademy: no slacks be strong no pushover please

[11:24:50] 0Douglas: @owlx7 yo uare weird
[11:24:52] fraudiola9: Cornwood chatters UltraMad
[11:24:53] YOUDOG2G: @mods
[11:24:58] msdeell: love turner, you guys are amazing
[11:24:58] Kryptonautti: @Cintr40 Nekoda only listens the captains, not the whole pd for some reason.
[11:24:59] beemo_plays: @uhsnow yeah.. when has pd not needed a new building
[11:25:03] HenryChase: Whos a good boy, aldo is a good boy peepoHappy
[11:25:04] ggTessic: @ThronDon Talking shit in a twitch chat when you don't even play the server is a great life :D
[11:25:06] salveck: we don't have enough officers! let's waste their time that'll help surely..
[11:25:06] Lupusdeus: Jon plays Ruth's henchman very well tbf
[11:25:07] Pakkasparkers: 4 up there is better than 0
[11:25:09] Krimson07_: GETALIFE Cope
[11:25:09] Kasvar: wideduckass chat so fast time to shake ass
[11:25:12] AsuniRS: it helps with numbers NotLikeThis if someone does paperwork up north, and another crime happens up north, it takes less time to respond REEEE
[11:25:13] YOUDOG2G: eddie you know what to do , cornwood chatters are attacking
[11:25:15] kratoids: Aldo reminds me a lot of someone
[11:25:18] skruhhbish: my god now I see why slacks gets so much hate cause the other captains never agree on anything.
[11:25:20] Ross_McD: Why the pushback? that is such an easy way to improve efficiency
[11:25:20] Gygosan: wideduckass
[11:25:23] KhornateChampion: Guys these characters. chill
[11:25:23] VladVolynine: @Kryptonautti He hasn't listened to Slacks once
[11:25:23] leviathan297: @fraudiola9  esfandL
[11:25:25] lookingfornothinghere: lets be real 5 cops will go to sandy so they can cumstack up there while the city burns
[11:25:26] Krimson07_: some of you need TouchGrass
[11:25:30] ThePlatinumMeta: wideduckass
[11:25:31] Jibry: everyone in chat arguing against each other FrogeBrick
[11:25:32] wolfgang_86: Train train train so many people waiting to be cops
[11:25:36] ThronDon: @ggTessic day off im chillin you get those with a job, sorry ur welfare cheque doesnt give u those :(
[11:25:41] HenryChase: Bark for me Aldo peepoHappy woof woof
[11:25:42] kroncman: wideduckass time to shake it
[11:25:42] Kryptonautti: @VladVolynine I said Captains not captain.
[11:25:43] SilentStormAU: MadCouncil we hate aldo now MadCouncil
[11:25:44] beemo_plays: Chew gum and walk
[11:25:48] Neiara__: @asunirs exactly saying drive them back to pd is so dumb LUL it’s the response time
[11:25:50] cjohno20: yeah you need like triple the numbers
[11:25:50] msdeell: come on jackson look to the future
[11:25:51] YOUDOG2G: @Eddie1225 u know what to do KEKW
[11:25:53] mercs99: @skruhhbish slacks definitelt tanks for the other captains a lot
[11:25:56] MrDaaku: mhm
[11:26:00] Creyoz: if aldo is commissioner the pd will regress
[11:26:01] snox3_: open up sherriffs office and let cornwood and andrews run that shit
[11:26:03] gatsymphony00: Because the mayor lives there mhm
[11:26:05] Reimainn: Slacks is right, but numbers makes it impossible
[11:26:08] Lord_Legolas: For him or for her?
[11:26:08] Dnas3: can't catch people on chases now in the city when everyone is on duty, splitting doesn't make sense until more staff imo
[11:26:08] TryAtomic: that's one of the mayors points on why he made his bill
[11:26:08] Krimson07_: cornwood gets his own department and takes his posse with him Prayge LSPD will thrive
[11:26:09] DizzyJump: Shoot High, ask for stuff.  Aim Low, Get stuff?
[11:26:11] Luthercorpz: I think Cornwood an his deputies will gladly fund their own little office
[11:26:13] throat_pump: the legislation implies that he can open new departments, you really don’t think he’d push to fund it?
[11:26:14] Cintr40: 30 minutes sandy, 30 min going back, 30min process, 30 min going to sandy - repeat
[11:26:15] Ross_McD: There aren't any negatives, and people are gonna patrol up there regardless
[11:26:15] MrDaaku: mhm 󠀀
[11:26:18] robertsmithjr: he might cut your pay to pay for it
[11:26:18] TheRealStanchez: maybe it's not a 24/7 office then.  Shift 2 certainly has the numbers to leave a presence up in Sandy
[11:26:21] beemo_plays: I don't understand this. Suggest a million things. What's the harm?
[11:26:23] uhSnow: saves money innit
[11:26:24] Najb0lji: and time
[11:26:25] Luthercorpz: Cornwood already funded PD for 3 months
[11:26:26] koolcoach: do we need a Police presence at the Prison too?
[11:26:27] Sieber13: This man cannot fathom what response time is
[11:26:28] superdave0603: Dude…
[11:26:29] fraudiola9: 1 cop presence in Sandy KEKW
[11:26:31] 0zarruu: because it wastes so much time obv lol
[11:26:31] MrDaaku: mhm its about presence
[11:26:32] walkgleesh: 30 minutes response for starters
[11:26:33] KylianMfrappe: we can't get A so lets put B, C and D on hold as well because A is priority
[11:26:34] YOUDOG2G: cornwood chatters are the new juicers KEKW
[11:26:36] doggensteinn: haha if aldo becomes commissioner no chance LASO opens anytime soon
[11:26:39] jadetortoise: how much money would it take? What is the problem with even requesting a quote and timeline?
[11:26:40] Krimson07_: @YOUDOG2G OMEGALAUGHING
[11:26:41] xeap: so he rather drives his broken car all the way back to the city instead? YEP???
[11:26:42] Seosamh22: time is numbers
[11:26:43] bbbrabbit123: Bro... Nekoda talk this much but whenever he sits in the council meeting he barely speak. WTF is going on?
[11:26:44] msdeell: get more on shift 1
[11:26:45] daacademy: bro is a puppet for someone else
[11:26:45] JivaJago: mhm
[11:26:45] Pakkasparkers: the logic.....
[11:26:50] Axcennts: it's cause they have the POV of shift 1 and 3 while shift 2 sometimes has like 15 cops
[11:26:51] ggTessic: @uhSnow I can imagine your voice saying innit and it does not sound right KEKW
[11:26:54] greasygreg613: its also about incentivizing other cops to go cause nobody else wants to do the drive
[11:26:54] cjohno20: tbf you don’t need to open anything to patrol up there
[11:26:56] Glitch3dGames: this is wild
[11:26:57] cartim33: or just to use for processing
[11:27:02] lookingfornothinghere: you need numbers first or else you are just splitting the little units
[11:27:03] SilentStormAU: waiting for the paragraph peters to start CoolStoryBob
[11:27:05] shadowpuma23: I wonder how this council meeting is gonna go
[11:27:06] Neiara__: It’s just a base of operations it’s not splitting everyone in half
[11:27:13] dellydonut: calls for backup in a car stop and Sandy, and have to wait 5 minutes for backup KEKW
[11:27:16] Pakkasparkers: its not expanding.....
[11:27:17] lovelee___: @bbbrabbit123 Aldo is talking
[11:27:18] kroncman: wideduckass im free to shake it
[11:27:18] daacademy: get cornwood away from the public lol open it up
[11:27:20] InSigma: NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[11:27:22] KhornateChampion: I mean the building's there... use it
[11:27:25] HenryChase: numbers feels like one shift problem what ive seen monkaHmm
[11:27:26] Ross_McD: It's not an expansion us just open offices LUL
[11:27:27] bbbrabbit123: @lovelee___ Oh my bad
[11:27:28] Kasvar: wideduckass
[11:27:33] neiro025: Just a base guys COPIUM
[11:27:33] fraudiola9: Empty building good for pd KEKW
[11:27:33] Krimson07_: MODDING me getting ready to write the most braindead shit in chat
[11:27:37] YOUDOG2G: @dellydonut yah from city to sandy is 5 minutes Kappa
[11:27:39] walkgleesh: can be used as a spot when needed
[11:27:42] kingshwing: I don't think they understand his point of opening up the door to getting more funding
[11:27:45] neiro025: Totally not going to make cornwood sheriff COPIUM
[11:27:48] BozzyGG: If ypu fall back to the city the people are going to start talk to al the people how are there, if they stay up there they dont get stuck
[11:27:51] Luthercorpz: If LASSO got opened it would thrive without a budget an quash all these theories.
[11:27:58] Jibry: CatAwoken
[11:28:07] Neiara__: I just don’t think they understand it has no impact on numbers
[11:28:07] TryAtomic: Big boom of employment incoming
[11:28:08] paudiiie: If you don't decide the budget, might as well ask, give priorities and let the council choose
[11:28:10] HenryChase: Cornwood will give his entire bank account for funding that sandy place LUL
[11:28:10] cjohno20: opening it prematurely without a dept kinda ruins the hype from a content perspective imo
[11:28:11] plasmapear: just because their shift cant fully utilize it doesnt mean another shift cant
[11:28:11] JivaJago: who cares about the budget ?
[11:28:11] daacademy: good point. opening that place up TOTALLY opens the door to more state funding
[11:28:12] uhSnow: wouldn’t the need for cops up north give us a bigger budget and more money? koilPff
[11:28:23] superdave0603: I don’t think he understands
[11:28:30] AsuniRS: more cops (up north) = more criminals caught = more income
[11:28:33] Mallyraws: @uhSnow good point
[11:28:34] msdeell: i agree
[11:28:34] Krimson07_: just a reminder the owen svensen is the best cop ever!!!! (not biased)
[11:28:35] 0zarruu: the thing is even if you have low numbers you still have to respond there so why not be able to use it
[11:28:37] Kryptonautti: @uhSnow Sorry but logic is not allowed in here.
[11:28:37] MrSirDudeGuyBro: it doesnt have to have just jail cells no?
[11:28:39] hen_gedymdeith: @uhSnow use money to make money, yep
[11:28:39] throat_pump: just have it brought up and state that it would be funded by the treasury rather than the pd budget if accepted
[11:28:39] skruhhbish: @mercs99 yea hurts the soul
[11:28:40] neiro025: @uhSnow PD budget is currently 0
[11:28:43] gatsymphony00: Just bring Cranes beloved grandson up there PepeLaugh
[11:28:45] Gygosan: Slacks need to start a squad
[11:28:50] Gygosan: Wcop
[11:28:53] donschaefer: Does the pd have any income ?
[11:28:53] SeraphButterfly: Vehicles that no one will be around to drive KEKW
[11:28:54] petterseff: @uhSnow i miss Snuw in the sky COPIUM
[11:28:56] RealistReason: Fix your vehicles, get more cops, then maybe it would make sense.
[11:28:58] daacademy: they’ve been asking for vehicles for a month my lord
[11:28:58] Creyoz: this pd high command is so conservative, whats up with not trying to get stuff improved
[11:28:58] zentsk: LMAOOO, slacks with the 2v1 as aways
[11:29:00] superdave0603: weeks?
[11:29:04] YOUDOG2G: @uhSnow cops cant catch people in city , but they will if they go up north Kappa
[11:29:07] AsuniRS: IF they have to prioritize ONE thing, vehicles should be prio tho, i agree. having to pay to work is crazy
[11:29:08] 0Douglas: surely if you are worried about money you can have officers start pooling in extra money, that can be reinbursed later? OMEGALAUGHING
[11:29:11] Pakkasparkers: you guys seem to be your own enemies
[11:29:12] daacademy: didn’t they just give the PD a bunch of trucks etc
[11:29:14] JivaJago: slacks should start vigilante gang to police sandy LUL
[11:29:14] ethameta: get bicycles
[11:29:14] KCoutdoors: @creyoz exactly
[11:29:15] thatclubdj: Faster vehicles = quicker travel time from paleto ... ezClap
[11:29:16] uselesscanteen: Who presents budget to the council?
[11:29:16] doggensteinn: @esfandtv didnt you buy a vehicle? so case solved
[11:29:21] robertsmithjr: @uhSnow in theory, but the mayor would probably cut pd pay, to pay for the new building in paleto
[11:29:29] salveck: nobody need to operate out of there, just process people
[11:29:30] GettingToasty22: this new in place guy is spicy
[11:29:32] beemo_plays: I feel like the state would be stoked to take $10 million out of the state budget for a new building
[11:29:32] uselesscanteen: You need really numbers and projections
[11:29:38] KhornateChampion: The trucks are azz too
[11:29:38] Hypo_: the sanitation war Aware
[11:29:38] Motomasher: Don’t you need way more cops
[11:29:42] geo_logic_: PD sani team soon for funding NODDERS

[11:30:27] KCoutdoors: he has to speak first
[11:30:28] gatsymphony00: Hmmm the council should make power bills really expensive to make people not wanna have 1000 butcoin
[11:30:28] Luthercorpz: Kappa
[11:30:29] doggensteinn: Kappa
[11:30:52] msdeell: so should it be pushed back
[11:30:59] Moregorilla: I'd think it's handicapping yourselves with the council my not just asking for everything and then just selling what the council will give

[11:55:55] Rare__Potato: You know they say that all men are created equal, but you look at me and you look at Duncan and you can see that statement is not true. See, normally if you go one on one with another captain, you got a 50/50 chance of winning. But I'm a genetic freak and I'm not normal! So you got a 25%, AT BEST, to beat me. Then you add Ruby York to the mix, your chances of winning drasticly go down.
[11:55:57] snox3_: thats cringe
[11:55:58] KCoutdoors: demoted
[11:55:59] Buddathegreat: what about dapping her?

[11:57:58] sokjuice: @lookingfornothinghere but not entitled to committing a crime iirc. I can't remember the exact wording. But treason can be committed through words spoken in this case
[11:58:00] Tuna_Chunks: fuck aldo just put ur hand up mate
