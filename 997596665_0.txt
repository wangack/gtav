[9:21:31] KinkyHobo: Every cop has to pick a lawyer to hate, it's just how it is in the city. Now youve got yours!
[9:21:47] AvalonneHoss: I think local time vs city time is such a metagaming move.... It's purposely using the difference between uncompressed and compressed time to muddle the entire chronology of events. It's totally metagaming because there's no way the characters would be aware of it.
[9:21:56] Hodgeman6: look at all those baas tickets LUL
