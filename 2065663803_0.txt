[4:03:54] IchibaToll: Possibly
[4:03:56] doc_sharon: NOPERS it happens with lots of cops
[4:04:03] chickeneer: Would be interesting if different models have different camera locations - maybe that

[4:04:25] MrSpiny: katesBonk Wheres the money

[4:07:12] Hoocairz: Very on brand, tbh
[4:07:14] Insaif: Still getting some silly times out of it. Cornwood is good at keeping things light, even for this.

[4:08:03] TheAceFire: Time for Kate to start getting an assistant paycheck for Dev work! katesCheer
[4:08:07] doc_sharon: except they ask everyone to whisper in the processing room Yesyes
[4:08:17] UppyFF: is the meeting room mic above the cells ?
[4:08:35] Insaif: I think that's what Nikez was trying to explain outside.
[4:08:43] Crazith: I mean Tobii wanted Kate to start working 3d models back in 3.0
[4:08:46] biboirl: he def doesn’t
[4:08:46] rickbuh: that's why he was talking about the drone
[4:08:50] Rootbreaker: yeah the camera was the drone stuff he was mentioning
[4:09:33] Insaif: Yeah, the camera is the 0 point for what you hear.
[4:09:37] if0rg0t2remember: yeah he needs to know you hear with your camera not your ears
[4:09:58] Crazith: I think the sound thing is more of a core GTA thing that is not that easy to adjust
[4:10:02] doc_sharon: yeah, you should not be able to hear everyone whisper across the room NODDERS
[4:10:23] Insaif: The hardest part with audio work (unlike other dev work) is there is not always anything you can see to help define the actual issue.
[4:10:36] hecktobreakfast: KEKW
[4:10:48] chickeneer: I want to see the lack of sound
[4:11:00] Insaif: Sounds like he wants to have these cells pretty muted.
[4:11:06] MrSpiny: #VoteCornwood
[4:11:28] AshuraX13: I'm loving this
[4:12:03] biboirl: a panel where he can set it

[4:12:10] AlliLovesGiraffes: katesGiggle
[4:12:15] hecktobreakfast: time to get a selfie
[4:12:29] Crazith: it's muffled, but I think that is good for RP
[4:12:29] Insaif: I think you'll get another chance.
[4:12:32] biboirl: a adjustable dial
[4:12:58] Egonor: can he do the interview room speaker thing but with a switch on the door like the food slot
[4:13:06] doc_sharon: are there still only 5 cops on duty? KEKW
[4:13:13] Insaif: If there were a speaker panel on there, it would make sense. Otherwise, someone yelling in a cell could be muffled, but should still be audible.
[4:13:37] Crazith: I like it as it is from what I have seen so far
[4:13:40] Insaif: katesGiggles

[7:10:46] JakeThomas506: @karnevil oh nice.. thanks for that info!
[7:11:26] VTMonster: Taylor could have pulled it off Sadge
[7:11:36] KarnEvil: shame the cliffy isn't in the catalog.  it was by far the best looking MC bike IMO.
[7:14:41] doc_sharon: katesSteer
[7:14:53] Siirika: Ah the Roo katesGiggles
[7:15:41] Siirika: katesBongo

[7:17:34] KarnEvil: i used to love sipping my coffee on those early 3.0 mornings were flo would just get in a chase to practice.  he was cracked in that little b class he had.
[7:17:42] Siirika: NODDERS Find and develop your style of driving, and you'd easily get to that kinda level yeah
[7:17:47] laxwall11: They took the corner and you backed into them
[7:18:04] doc_sharon: Richard finding routes all through the city was so fun katesSnug
[7:18:18] laxwall11: Okay okay
[7:18:55] KarnEvil: nope
[7:18:57] KarnEvil: only4
[7:19:18] Siirika: Do you remember the Chicklets special around where popular moters is now? katesHm That one was naaaasty
[7:19:22] KarnEvil: wait, really? I've never seen anyone use 5th in this thing.  it must be shit.
[7:19:28] laxwall11: Watching flo make routes was such a great vibe
[7:20:04] Insaif: The best ones have multiple ways in/out to confuse the cops. Yesyes
[7:20:16] Insaif: The Club is way too low for stairs and curb routes.
[7:20:30] hecktobreakfast: basically scraping along the asphalt
[7:20:36] fattydelrey: put ya foot on the gas
[7:20:41] doc_sharon: I almost wish Taylor could come back for a day to give us some routes katesAw
[7:21:14] hecktobreakfast: Kappa

[7:22:44] fattydelrey: wasn't his just a fence trick
[7:22:56] Insaif: Oh, maybe it's the Italian Villa?

[7:24:49] rickbuh: this is two people showing off spots they learned from their old groups LUL

[7:29:05] doc_sharon: just don't get boxed in NODDERS
[7:29:23] lorddracnor: The Legacy is cemented
[7:29:50] A_Humble_Wooper: Lots of little nooks and crannies you might be able to drop a person in up there, too.
[7:30:21] hecktobreakfast: katesNoted
[7:30:37] Insaif: Maxx gets the first swap of the club. katesCool
[7:31:14] Siirika: Construction is kinda both a swap and a drop yeah
[7:31:18] doc_sharon: that part of the Roo is def an ankle pop NODDERS
[7:31:23] Insaif: Could be a drop as well. NODDERS
[7:32:01] Insaif: Pretty much, anywhere you can lose eyes long enough to let someone off and they can run in a different direction is a drop spot.
[7:32:34] doc_sharon: could you swap in CBC garage? katesHm
[7:32:37] Jorsh029: Why yes, hullo there, Kate and Chatloaf! itsjusHi katesHi jorsh0Wiggle
[7:32:49] Insaif: @Jorsh029 MEOWDY
[7:32:54] laxwall11: What is the definition of drops?
[7:32:56] Jorsh029: How is everybody?
[7:32:56] A_Humble_Wooper: Hi Jorsh! katesHi
[7:32:58] hecktobreakfast: @Jorsh029 MEOWDY
[7:34:00] hecktobreakfast: katesHUH
[7:34:02] A_Humble_Wooper: I'm doing pretty good, what about you Jorsh? katesFlower

[7:34:24] Dongolev: Well, maybe not that one
[7:34:41] Jorsh029: I'm vibing katesSnug trying to finish out my adulting tonight to enjoy me three day weekend
[7:34:46] doc_sharon: could drop there NODDERS
[7:34:48] Jorsh029: *my
[7:35:14] doc_sharon: but a passenger could run down there NODDERS
[7:35:17] Insaif: Yeah, those are tricky routes.
[7:35:19] Siirika: would be WAY easier in an automatic though
[7:35:22] A_Humble_Wooper: Could be sweet on bikes tho.
[7:35:34] laxwall11: With practice that could work
[7:36:09] AshuraX13: Drops I think as a foot bail spot
[7:36:10] KarnEvil: yeah a lot of those really tight alleys require a ton of practice so you hit them but the cops don't.
[7:36:12] doc_sharon: nice
[7:36:15] Siirika: Ez Clap
[7:36:26] CAYKE__: Woop
[7:36:28] laxwall11: Oooo nice
[7:36:32] A_Humble_Wooper: Yeah, just needs some practice with the angles and speeds. Super possible with little cars like this one.
[7:36:35] doc_sharon: its risky biscuit, but it works
[7:36:46] tyrelrahl: That was clean.  Well done
[7:36:48] doc_sharon: Yesyes
[7:36:57] IchibaToll: Swaps also have the element of positioning the other car in a way where it's easier for them to get out.  Drops are a bit more open-ended.
[7:37:11] Nightbot: Follow Kate on Instagram! instagram.com/kate.ttv
[7:37:13] Insaif: This would definitely be better on a bike. NODDERS
[7:37:15] RNG78: Motorcycle route
[7:37:17] laxwall11: That would definitely shake a single CVPI
[7:37:17] Jorsh029: All this route hunting makes me wish Tracolli and Volk would roll into town with a newfound love for choppers bythyPRAY katesBless
[7:37:36] A_Humble_Wooper: Heh
[7:37:42] doc_sharon: the car could also pause at the top of the stairs, and a passenger could run out for a VIP plan there NODDERS
[7:37:56] A_Humble_Wooper: @Jorsh029 katesCopium
[7:37:57] laxwall11: Little harder if there are parallel units
[7:38:13] Insaif: That's why.
[7:38:58] Jorsh029: Imagine Felix and Tom boosting? katesCopium
[7:40:00] Insaif: @Jorsh029 Oh man, I would LOVE to have Felix with this crew. katesCopium

[7:40:34] hecktobreakfast: oh....
[7:40:37] AshuraX13: I think she is getting it
[7:40:42] Insaif: Wonder if they rebind to a mouse-wheel or something.
[7:40:43] Jorsh029: @insaif same felixl2Cool
[7:40:53] machcymus: Thio bound his shifting to mouse wheel up/down
[7:41:07] Jorsh029: Oh, mouse whell up/down is smort
[7:41:20] Insaif: What do you normally use for shifting?
[7:41:20] CAYKE__: I know people have bought MMO mouses
[7:41:20] Siirika: do you have a wheel click you could move on/off to?
[7:41:30] A_Humble_Wooper: @Jorsh029 Volk, or even a totally new character, either would be awesome. katesBless
[7:42:07] Jorsh029: I just miss my British shitter with a heart of gold jorsh0Hug
[7:42:11] hecktobreakfast: Kappa the headaches make it trippy.
[7:42:17] Insaif: @Jorsh029 katesHug
[7:42:18] laxwall11: Is it still set up backwards for you as well?
[7:42:29] Insaif: Kappa  Check!
[7:42:45] CAYKE__: Meka bought a mouse specifically for extra thumb buttons
[7:42:53] CAYKE__: So she can shift
[7:43:16] Jorsh029: Your g502 should have mouse wheel left and right clicks
[7:43:48] Jorsh029: Ah, gotcha
[7:44:08] CAYKE__: Zerkaa was talking about another mouse for manual driving
[7:44:12] Thorn104: Cleaning my keyboard and it's amazing how much crap gets stuck in here.. epically since I have long hair
[7:44:16] its_me_andie: Hello katesHi katesFlower
[7:44:35] hecktobreakfast: MEOWDY @its_me_andie
[7:44:54] CAYKE__: But zerkaa was saying he had several binds
[7:45:00] its_me_andie: Good. Just had a sick 3 hour nap that was very refreshing! katesSnug
[7:45:28] Insaif: Ah, that could be a problem

[7:48:32] Jorsh029: Maybe right clicking removes the binding?
[7:48:35] rickbuh: probably a gta online one
[7:48:44] AshuraX13: Is car radio in general?
[7:48:55] doc_sharon: radio on off was above
[7:49:17] CAYKE__: KEKW
[7:49:22] doc_sharon: katesDed
[7:49:27] CAYKE__: Keybinds are a mess

[8:17:28] A_Humble_Wooper: @Pleasantmsp Mason got in a cop chase with his car full of weed stuff, called for backup, then apparently was tazed? That's most of what we know anyway. It's unclear to us whether he was able to ditch the product or not before he got caught.
[8:18:12] A_Humble_Wooper: Crime-ing solo is fine... until it's very much not.
[8:18:21] AshuraX13: Up north is tough to lose cops in too
[8:18:29] Pleasantmsp: @A_Humble_Wooper ah I see, thanks katesBless

[8:18:44] A_Humble_Wooper: Throwing it into the swamp IS not the worst move though...
[8:18:55] KarnEvil: yeah, none of the rental cars are fast enough to highway blast.

[8:26:33] laxwall11: I mean you all needed like 3 more minutes and could have helped
[8:26:36] KarnEvil: yeah, if he ditched it over a bridge who knows where it could have landed.
[8:26:39] Insaif: It's tough here because even if he was able to toss it, there's so much area to cover.

[8:28:11] Insaif: Do we even know what the item looks like on the ground when it's thrown?
[8:28:17] AshuraX13: Yeah, he would chuck it from drivers seat
[8:28:20] doc_sharon: one day we could science it Nerdge
[8:28:21] KarnEvil: well if he was driving, and headed north, it would probably be on the other side of the bridge.
[8:28:43] Insaif: @KarnEvil No, this is the northbound side of the bridge.
[8:29:00] Insaif: Well, I see what you mean.
[8:29:07] doc_sharon: but drivers are on the left NODDERS
[8:29:10] AntiochChouteau: Do you know if the boys found the weed last night?
[8:29:11] Insaif: If he throws from the driver side, it would go left, yeah.
[8:29:20] KarnEvil: ye
[8:29:26] Insaif: Unless it's tossed over the car. katesShrug
[8:29:44] KarnEvil: oh, you can aim it? I thought it just chucked it

[8:30:54] hecktobreakfast: katesGiggles
[8:31:01] flathaed: If he threw it I'm sure the cops would be out here searching for it.
[8:31:03] KarnEvil: there is so much ground to cover, it's gonna be nearly impossible to find if he threw it without talking to him about it.
[8:31:03] A_Humble_Wooper: Welp, at least if YOU are having this much trouble finding it hopefully the cops would too? Assuming there's anything here to find.
[8:32:05] Insaif: katesHug Next time.
[8:32:09] doc_sharon: would have been so fun
[8:32:19] IchibaToll: Yeah, when that first kicked off, I thought we were 5 minutes from him hopping the wall at Construction
[8:32:24] rickbuh: the fact he was in the city and went GOH wasn't a great move
[8:32:26] doc_sharon: yeah, we will have to get the whole story
[8:32:45] laxwall11: Just like 3 minutes and it would have been good

[8:34:45] hecktobreakfast: just a whole bag of disappointment
[8:34:51] Insaif: The good news is, if the cops didn't find it you have plenty of time to go search properly with the club if needed.
[8:35:02] hecktobreakfast: all that pool stuff
[8:35:05] Insaif: And in the pool. katesGiggles
[8:35:05] AshuraX13: And in the pool!

[9:30:40] LilMaGooby: Right below VP
[9:30:41] DrMcLolcat: I think just command
[9:30:41] KarnEvil: no, just command. SAA is HC
[9:30:42] AshuraX13: Command, not HC
[9:30:42] A_Humble_Wooper: I think it depends on the club?
[9:30:43] VTMonster: It's medium command
[9:30:47] DrMcLolcat: HC is Pres, VP, and SAA
[9:30:48] abblepiewit: Just command, yeah.
[9:30:50] lindsayisthecraic: command
[9:31:00] Denetti_: 4th?
[9:31:03] laxwall11: I think it's highest of the command tho
[9:31:05] kx07stitch: did maxx punish her way into command? lol katesGiggle
[9:31:07] JovanMaxis: It's a double command-burger rather than a triple in terms of command structure.
[9:31:07] frsttyyy: you'd be 3rd in command of the club if you were made road captain
[9:31:10] willowfennec: Road Captain is what Wade calls seniors
[9:31:11] Insaif: I think you would technically be above Rue at that point.
[9:31:12] Kthanid: Club safety and preparedness.
[9:31:12] AshuraX13: Looking out for everyone during jobs and rides
[9:31:16] frsttyyy: till the other roles get fille dup
[9:31:30] lorddracnor: watch it be sgt at arms and you skip road captain
[9:31:32] A_Humble_Wooper: @kx07stitch nah, not punish. She's just too competent at wrangling folks
[9:31:46] laxwall11: And doing rides
[9:31:47] Kthanid: Enforces the laws and rules of the club.
[9:31:47] UppyFF: what if it’s acting VP for the week lanes away
[9:31:47] Insaif: Basically what you've been doing the last few days. katesYEP
[9:31:50] lindsayisthecraic: road captain is such a wonderful title and role one of my personal facs
[9:31:50] abblepiewit: Road Captain is stuff Maxx kinda already does, yeah.
[9:31:51] VTMonster: SAA just has to be buff
[9:31:52] kx07stitch: @a_humble_wooper ahhhh makes sense
[9:31:58] Siirika: s also kinda wierd though, cause on a job usually RC would be the be all end all in terms of who to listen to
[9:32:00] AshuraX13: SAA Makes people follow the rules and sets out punishments
[9:32:01] Jackhilo: THAT'S OUR SERGEANT katesFlower
[9:32:01] doc_sharon: watch them tack on Treasurer too KEKW
[9:32:01] KarnEvil: RC typically rides in the back of the club rides, right? to keep everyone in line.
[9:32:03] Stoffern: sgt at arms is the judge (enforcer is executioner) as Ive heard it.
[9:32:05] hecktobreakfast: @UppyFF That's Wade katesGiggles
[9:32:11] Insaif: @VTMonster katesBonk
[9:32:12] NoodleCubed: SAA is discipline and weapons
[9:32:14] DrMcLolcat: Enforcer falls under SAA
[9:32:16] laxwall11: But you can also call for a club ride as well which is super fun and cool
[9:32:22] doc_sharon: might die katesShrug
[9:32:24] lindsayisthecraic: @KarnEvil can lead, or tailgunner does the back end
[9:32:39] KarnEvil: @lindsayisthecraic katesFlower
