[3:15:09] inwethrust: 48
[3:15:10] e1k4bong: Zaza is 48%
[3:15:32] LimeWire: @e1k4bong because, lang would need to have 4 sellers to bring zaza down to 25%, but they will never reach 100 because they would need to sell what lang sold + more, it bottle necks around 70.

[3:16:56] LimeWire: @KimParktsingLee just a ballpark estimate, of both sides pushing like 4k bags a day, at a certain point the volume will be so large, it just wont move
[3:16:58] AK1N0M_: i dont think they get that the thug of war is by volume not %
[3:16:59] Remorse45: Benji the one tanking the Zaza KEKW
[3:17:01] jerm_56: the people want to see Zaza hit 100%
[3:17:03] e1k4bong: @limewire there have to be more factors than what you've said. I am not syaing you are wrong. I am just saying specifically what you said, logically, doesnt seem to make much sense
[3:17:05] J0urin: @brittbritt90d tbh i forgot how much he sold that might be tru
[3:17:08] Cultivated: @annabethG I believe the general locals around just like your products more so maybe get shot less?
[3:17:09] Mhysamari: Higher percentage means more money according to Lang I believe

[3:17:25] thorstyyyy: Can I see the rep of Zaza and Anita so I can make it to a command @Lysium ?
[3:17:25] Xernique: Being top strain in the highest volume turfs will prob lead to later unlocks. So right now we gettin fucked
[3:17:28] outy_xd: Hey @Lysium  are you doing the puzzle, do you think it might be something to do with the locations of the icons on the tablet match the icon locations on the puzzle?

[3:17:39] goooodguyy: u guys will hold it then seller 2 will push it to 55 boom

[3:18:01] thorstyyyy: I only saw Zaza omE
[3:18:04] AK1N0M_: when u guys reach 50% its means youve only sold half of what lang sold and u have to double it plus more
[3:18:07] Vorzo: so ray thinks once you get 100% turf you can get a hangout area
[3:18:12] qvbxx: realistically speaking is Cypress worth the effort?

[3:18:46] Fossabot: üî• The daily subgoal is at 200 subs.

[3:19:07] e1k4bong: @limewire there is 0 chance that the company has sold 48% of what lang has. Lang has 5 sellers to our 1 and we are gaining. It doesnt make sense
[3:19:09] BoxFan112: @ak1n0m_ it's just hard to see that cuz how are 6 sellers selling all day every day and 2 sellers for the company and some how gained 20% in like 2 days
[3:19:18] krisdouble5: yeah that will be a late payment every other week lol
[3:19:19] conzfearacy12: the way lang explained it sound like they could never hit 100% at this point

[3:19:26] LimeWire: @e1k4bong it literally does tho lol
[3:19:27] Blaze24x7: Sellers could just keep what they get at this point imo
[3:19:28] iTzJboot: the fact you need the chip in tablet to buy it, it might have something to do with turf rep. also super confusing.

[3:20:15] DarkSaddam: we dont have enough sellers, and benji wanna all the money back. this is not gonna work
[3:20:20] conzfearacy12: @ggchatter2023 he wasnt sure bout the powerbill but he pretty much confirmed it ooc yesterday you will see though
[3:20:23] AK1N0M_: its like some of you guys dont understand how volume and percent works when the variables are always moving up. it scales
[3:20:24] brittbritt90d: lang has to stop selling to let the company catch up to get 100%
[3:20:32] Vorzo: ray, OTT, and Jp said they can keep the money
[3:20:40] G1ZONE: @Vorzo YES
[3:20:41] Blaze24x7: That‚Äôs the best way rn for them to keep what they sell rn since earnings are not there yet
[3:21:19] e1k4bong: @xernique if you say so, but lang has 5 guys selling at a timr and at least speedy at all other times...they should always be pushing way more. Yet the company is moving up in %. That doesnt make sense mathematically.
[3:21:20] conzfearacy12: @ggchatter2023 well thats what copium is for you will see
