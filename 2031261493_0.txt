[1:25:22] EGGZOLENTZ: @ramsin50 if grey was identified with gun at time of robbery how does that make sense
[1:25:22] kb420ps: "Double Jeopardy" is charging ONE person with the same crime twice.
[1:25:23] TheJoeIsMe: thats not how that works
[1:25:25] superbizarr0: Double Jeopardy is the same person you can charge everyone that has handled the thing
[1:25:26] yvngneek: see you at snr buns shiesty another day another L

[1:25:32] macneutron: Isn't double jeopardy the same person?
[1:25:32] nanaosaki_ee: @serpenting 😂😂😂😭
[1:25:33] AlienatedFL: you would charge the guy with the gun with possession and other people with accessory
[1:25:33] tr0kgaming: its the same person
[1:25:36] BarryEdwards: these convserations need a judge
[1:25:36] shockingriley: no it’s the same person

[1:25:40] shockingriley: wtf are they on about
[1:25:41] Rascal_PM: they are so wrong on this one
[1:25:42] freddevongradde: This is dumb... The one taking the gun and the one that possess the gun should be held accountable?!?!
[1:25:43] little_birdie27: Thank you @RKO6301221 and @fives563

[1:25:45] eckphoenix: Makes sense, common sense tbh
[1:25:47] bobbybeee: they need to get their stories straight
[1:25:47] Xellwrath: You can't charge for possession for something that's not in possession lmao
[1:25:48] Superhank: judge will probably drop the no possession though
[1:25:48] wispamii: That is NOT double jeopardy, Dean. They tryna get you for bs and they believe whatever they spew.
[1:25:49] wiglaf__: NAH THESE MAN ARE TAPPED
[1:25:51] superbizarr0: possession can be shared
[1:25:54] AlienatedFL: @Deansocool you would charge the person with the gun with 'possession' and the others with accessory
[1:25:54] GxdzR6: there not even sure how are you supposed to be sure
[1:25:54] mikebcreepin: The Double Jeopardy Clause in the Fifth Amendment to the US Constitution prohibits anyone from being prosecuted twice for substantially the same crime.
[1:25:55] StevenB79: but they were seen in possesion
[1:25:56] hyotee: that's not double jeopardy
[1:25:56] tr0kgaming: double jeopardy applies to the same person
[1:25:57] ShyGuySG_: double jep only appllys to same person they just talking out there ass now
[1:25:57] wixxastream: why not? if u have officer testimony it should be possible
[1:25:58] tvsA9: IT DOESNT MATTER IF THE POSSESSION WAS IN THE PAST
[1:26:00] Tawdry___: possesion infers the ability to take possion of and evedence it
[1:26:01] Broad186: They are very wrong
[1:26:04] DevilDF: Makes sense, but he did posses it and can be proven?

[1:26:15] trinisavage6: @wiglaf__ WALAH
[1:26:16] Fizban_The_Fabulous: @w0nkita Same! KEKW
[1:26:20] StevenB79: Officer says he possesed it by taking it
[1:26:24] hafugu: so we can prove he was in possession when it was stolen by him.  We could also prove whoever now has it is in possession when we find it on them
[1:26:25] Mr__Chikin: surely if 2 people can have possession of a pet they can share possession of a firearm
[1:26:31] Xen_Crypt: They should have judges state how possession works rather than officers arguing it
[1:26:31] armedgolem01: the object (the gun) doesn't get double jeopardy  huh
[1:26:32] Trystah: If Senor Buns don't work out, you can work for your star CI Jason in G6, he's the supervisor LUL
[1:26:35] danielwhite_2007: but u can’t tell whose gun is whose so how u gonna tell it was her gun and not another pd officers
[1:26:36] little_birdie27: Possession is present
[1:26:41] SuuWasTaken: captains dont know what double jeopardy is smh
[1:26:49] the_mister_brooks89: damn I just got 8 ads and now another 5? smh
[1:26:52] mrwal73r: u need to hit da job center soon cuh

[1:27:04] TripleDekeConway: @danielwhite_2007 Guns have serial numbers?
[1:27:07] Gachiguru: FREE PD GLOCK PogU
[1:27:07] entvidya: can't you even charge someone for the same crime again IF it's part of another incident? double jeopardy just applies to attempting to press charges again for the same incident
[1:27:08] wispamii: So ridiculous man..
[1:27:08] tvsA9: @Mr__Chikin Possession has nothing to do with double jeopardy. If i steal a gun and give it to you. we bought are guilty of possesion
[1:27:10] kb420ps: They need a judge or a lawyer.
[1:27:11] zedhryxx: man you need jesus
[1:27:11] RoninSisu: MAkes sense
[1:27:12] ZealotB: its going to caught so they should wait for the verdict
[1:27:14] superbizarr0: NODDERS  double jeopardy is the same person being charged twice for the one crime not multple peopel
[1:27:15] Rascal_PM: a judge should review this
[1:27:17] wardenau: these higher ups need academy fo real

[1:27:24] tarun_21: they ain't even listening
[1:27:24] Xellwrath: You can't charge for the past lol that's wild. The captains example then means everybody in a group handing the gun to each other is guilty at one point or another.

[1:28:31] OldOhana: o7 󠀀
[1:28:35] mynameismikeyd: the wording of the law makes it so if there was a circle jerk of passing a gun around in plain view of an officer, the wording of the law makes it ok to charge everyone. the wording of the law is bad, so it’s open to interpretation
[1:28:36] serpenting: o7

[3:07:04] zjdvvvv: I hope this is a step in the story to create the bcso or something though, would be cool
[3:07:06] marneraiders: 2 of them were questionable, but „Charging someone for possession without evidence“ is DAP worthy
[3:07:09] hyotee: its only 24h suspension
[3:07:09] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: exactly the JUDGE said STACK 🤦🏻‍♂️
[3:07:12] TheGoatstare: at this right u gonna get fired next week

[3:08:13] Trixcross: @deansocool i just watched back the vod, your issue isn't that you're leading shit and getting blamed it's literally just that yiu need to put the paperwork first cause it's the inly thing that matters to actually pushing charges
[3:08:13] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: imagine daps for a cowboy hat 🤠 lol no warnings 😆
[3:08:15] SuuWasTaken: 1 day suspension and 1 talk with ruth from getting fired
[3:08:19] WadeTheRed: 60 irl days? tf
[3:08:21] AlienatedFL: I feel like low key Denzel is getting the wrong idea from this and just needs to tighten up on the reports
