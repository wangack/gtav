[1:16:38] kjdub523: why have security of u need a cop with u
[1:16:38] Nomad_Ninja: they should be hiring off-duty police for escort
[1:16:39] luke420710: Yep
[1:16:39] RednekMetal: L move especially when they tell you to be a better crim imo
[1:16:41] ReinBork: In America security can request police back up for anything
[1:16:47] subehh: if cops are cool and wanna make rp out of it then yeah cool
[1:16:48] salveck: they should stay in car and other person should close themselves in the vault
[1:16:50] sixoddeight: they allow them to park illegally
[1:16:50] Max_Mckayful: Love the RP point about security, lol
[1:16:51] finnish00: They are security aren't they so I think police escort is little too much
[1:16:52] iamloyaltytv: i think if the are robbed like 3 times they should get 1 escort then next time they on thier own
[1:16:52] Johnjoy121: Need to drop more QRCodes for creativity LUL LUL LUL
[1:16:54] tomr33: I see why they did that because they can't get a run done with everyone in the city robbing them lol

[1:16:57] tshots_: its lame but understanable with all the gun robberies
[1:17:01] Sigfred42: Well the problem is the security team does not have the tools to fully secure
[1:17:05] Imanscp: they don't have guns, and got robbed at least 30 times today
[1:17:05] Denraoden: g6 should have a temp gun and body armour in 1 dude and be a 3 man job
[1:17:06] Nomad_Ninja: Then they shouldn't be hiring... simple
[1:17:08] RagoDK: no weapon license so its fair i think
[1:17:08] someonecreepin: no cops but g6 get a tazer to defend themseves

[1:17:31] sixoddeight: the cops should be allowed to occasional investigative stings but not constant
[1:17:41] SilliTFT: x held 4 of them hostage earlier with a gun right so it's kinda understandable they play it even safer
[1:17:42] blackdoos: they can roll 4 deep in a truck, they make enough money to split it 4 ways with 2 security at the truck
[1:17:47] AddyAdam: the reality is the pallets are worth less today because of how often crims have hit them.
[1:17:52] WikiDic: considering the cops werent with the first time but came when called is realistic
[1:17:59] Nomad_Ninja: @RagoDK perfect opportunity to allow robberies to show they NEED weapons for defense... which is handled by the mayor.

[2:18:18] skutza: I still have the Iphone 11 pro max, got it when it came out still works perfectly and the battery is still very good!
[2:18:21] Grioghar182: I will use my device until it becomes a paperweight, upgrading every 2 years is a fuckton of money
[2:18:36] IamthaKingslayer: problem is most people are charging there phone to much or leaving it on charge to long
