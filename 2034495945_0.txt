[0:53:02] mike9904_: So much more space for storage being able to just have an actual pile of weed
[0:53:11] PaganHeart: They probably should add a few more storage furniture options though. I have a feeling that it would help with server performance, but maybe those items on the ground aren't as impactful as they used to be.
[0:53:12] Face_32: A lot of people just use the inventory UI to put stuff on the ground so it all ends up in paper bags

[7:07:55] KrisCat: @AloofMango yeah, it's different to sell weed WHILE working than to rent a cheap vehicle from a job solely to sell weed to circumvent rental prices.
[7:08:17] AloofMango: also they couldbe using job vehicle like you said to bypass the renting cost but they have to bear the repair costs since people barely chose to repair rented cars
