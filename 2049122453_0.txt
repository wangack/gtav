[3:11:11] Delnoir: "Jerry said so" strikes again PepeLaughing
[3:11:29] wellingtonsmom: Hat and Trevor are bad at communicating lol
[3:11:43] Archaius: he wants you to move some of the bigger fine to the smaller ones so he can just barely still pay the smaller ones
[3:11:50] Archaius: atleast i think thats what he means
[3:11:59] StubbsPKS: That's my guess too
[3:12:24] wellingtonsmom: I think he just wants to pay partial fines, but the communication is fuzzy
[3:12:37] narmik: No they pay x amount of the fine then you lower the fine by the x amount
[3:12:44] MrSym: That's just pushing the problem on LUL
[3:12:59] MrSupernoodles: So part payment?
[3:13:01] Archaius: @narmik sure but thats not how the system works, they can only select a fine and then pay the full amoutn of that
[3:13:22] Archaius: so to make it work you have to lets say remove 500$ from the bigger fine and add 500$ to the small one
[3:13:46] Archaius: and that way he can pay off the full amount on the small one and still reduce the big fine
[3:14:47] wellingtonsmom: I'm glad you're getting some hands on experience with it to help figure out what's best
[3:14:59] Archaius: yeah it is janky af and annoying for everyone
[3:15:09] narmik: yeah but its the work around there is right now
[3:15:31] Sighlo: yeah like once its overdue its a total balance not for each fine
[3:15:50] Archaius: imo they should just not get zeroed out until the system is set up to work in a better ay
[3:15:51] Archaius: way*
[3:16:06] wellingtonsmom: It would make sense for RL because you can't pay part of a ticket without a court or judge setting up a payment. In game it makes more sense to have a total and you pay from there
[3:16:09] Archaius: bc all that back and forth with the fines is just a waste of time for everyone

[3:18:54] maddhatterr: as usual Kyle i s LOUD KEKW
[3:20:24] MrSym: Is this all to just try and avoid people going into debt?
[3:20:48] Oxull: KEKW
[3:21:17] MrSym: Yeah poor wording by me I guess, I meant to avoid going into a negative balance
[3:21:33] Sighlo: if they go into the minus it wont make it better for the state. its not like the state gets that money, they just have it logged differently
[3:22:17] laerin101: Occams talked about it the other day, going thousands or mils into debt just inflates the state money, for nothing really
[3:23:18] Archaius: the solution has to involve some way of generating money for the economy
[3:23:46] MrSym: Perhaps converting unpaid fines (where the debtor has $0.00 balance) into a jail sentence or some other consequence, if caught?
[3:24:18] Archaius: ngl part of the solution imo is that crime needs to pay more, all these crims are broke af
[3:24:31] MrSym: @Archaius That doesn't really solve the issue at all, just delays it
[3:25:00] Archaius: yeah thats why its only part but i do think it needs to happen
[3:25:12] Archaius: and maybe thats just because crime is in its early stages rn
[3:25:17] narmik: @Archaius What you mean, go rob an grave and make $30 but get $700 in fine xD
[3:25:24] narmik: but it will all come into place
[3:25:29] wellingtonsmom: @MrSym Kyle and Occams are currently talking about a combo of community service, forcing to pay fines when they have money, bonds paid by friends or family and jail time when none of that works.
[3:25:58] MrSym: @wellingtonsmom Yeah that's a good way to do it if they want to avoid pushing people into the negative

[3:26:55] coyotes____: klasu Gladge
[3:27:02] xKlasu: @coyotes____ Gladge
[3:27:02] wellingtonsmom: @MrSym It's a balance of the state getting their money and not discouraging people to keep playing by being so far down they feel like they can't get out of the hole. So they're trying to figure out how heavy handed to be.
[3:27:05] MrSym: Perhaps once property ownership is in, even being able to attach a lien on a property?
[3:27:28] narmik: yeah get me my taco truck and I can be selling tacos and buying the stuff I need from the farmer's market, its gonna be so great

[3:28:21] xEmmchen: Binoculars hello Chat and Streamer
[3:28:22] wellingtonsmom: They already don't get breaks in fines or time in jail if they have overdue fines
[3:28:23] MrSym: @wellingtonsmom It'll be something that needs to be constantly evaluated as more serious crime and money making methods get introduced, otherwise it runs the risk of just becoming meaningless
[3:28:58] BigPun1907: @xEmmchen dankWave
[3:29:33] wellingtonsmom: @MrSym For sure. Occams said yesterday they needed to just figure something out so people aren't in limbo and if it doesn't work they'll adjust

[3:38:43] DarthyDen: An activity in Jail that earns money towards the debt might be a good idea .. means people would have to grind their debts
