[6:09:39] xl_scout_lx: Like with DeRollo
[6:09:46] TeeRiot: plus him and denzel were the same postion at one point so him saying that is crazy
[6:09:47] rome696: Selective hearing KEKW
[6:09:47] Vanizzlebear: being called a nobody was wildddd
[6:09:47] sj1harm: the awkward silence is actually hilarious
[6:09:49] xypher85: @Deansocool dont forget the statement and evidence
[6:09:51] autisticboots: bro Leon used t be so chill, this is why Den never rolled w him in the first place

[6:10:16] Vorpalwarp: @1Tesla1 bro he'll be fine
[6:10:22] rambow_07: He did approach him the wrong way
[6:10:22] hal_apeynyo: he really didn‚Äôt need to say the you‚Äôre basically nothing right now lol
[6:10:24] bluntfork44: 100% he started off with a chip on his sholder
[6:10:26] mikewhocheesehairyyyy12: I would've acted the same way honestly
[6:10:28] Tcmasterzzz: need cornwood to harsh things out between these two

[6:36:21] kb420ps: From what I've seen,  they don't brake or turn well.
[6:36:27] wildarrow88: It does 180 with a big turbo
[6:36:40] Vorpalwarp: having played on a lot of smaller RP servers, yeah shits never perfect
[6:36:47] badperson1234: And sequential
[6:36:48] GalaxyDoesTwich: didnt the cvpi hit like 140 ?

[6:40:07] angus1794: don't turbos just improve acceleration not top speed irl?
[6:40:23] FilzG: cornwood wants to put a turbo on this one
[6:40:28] Zekkenn_: @angus1794 they do both, top speed more than accel I think ngl
[6:40:31] LongDongSilverrr13: if the chase is called off should let Leon drive in good faith
[6:40:34] heartsonlysoren: you gotta use it with the 99 turbo to see the problem
[6:40:34] XenonVIII: offer to let him drive it back
[6:40:35] j0k3rhub: @angus1794 i own a ford focus i wouldnt know

[6:41:01] Enoobrac: @j0k3rhub I thought the ST had a little baby turbo?
[6:41:02] BigSeth: @j0k3rhub I got ford fusion and got some mods in it üòÇ
[6:41:05] rnAlsation: The turbo helps some cars shift up in game. This car gets stuck in 7th.
[6:41:10] kb420ps: @angus1794 IRL,  a turbo improves horsepower and torque.  So,  that would equate to acceleration and top speed,  all in conjunction with the gear ratio and transmission.
[6:41:11] Rebsdorf_TFT: let cornwood handle it arnoldHalt
[6:41:27] FilzG: 7th gear 120mph o7

[6:42:55] Zunnun: Deano did you take out your turbo @deansocool
[6:42:57] Slide1: Highway blaster with 140 top speed PepeLaugh
[6:43:06] chmbrs: turbos shouldnt be able to be stolen. ill die on that hill
[6:43:14] BigSeth: cars turn radius is wider then a female with a BBL in Miami
[6:43:30] mavericks312: your highway blaster just gonna get blasted lol
[6:43:31] Zunnun: Did you take put your 83 turbo from the cruiser @deansocool
[6:43:32] kb420ps: The PD needs a 200 mph car.  If not,  then the crims have a clear advantage.
[6:43:38] Zunnun: Out*
[6:43:41] Thraxton1: with a 99 it does 180 though
[6:43:48] Frvnkzy: just make the pds like a supercharger and not have it removeable
[6:43:48] TeeRiot: @chmbrs agreed because now every civ car got a 99 in it
[6:43:56] kaexium: @chmbrs or at least take more time to remove / add one, i dont know anyone who can remove a turbo from a car within 10 seconds omE
[6:44:55] Beafour: @chmbrs There are so many ways to make it a better mechanic though. Cornwood or one of the mechanics suggested it to take like 1+ min to take out, and that would pretty much fix it
[6:45:23] FilzG: wtf is going on here
[6:45:36] owlx7: hey chat, how many of the 3 FTO has den zel completed so far?

[6:46:33] AsuniRS: You should ask permission to leave the gas station, your boss isn't with you atm
[6:46:36] Beafour: @advancedwolverine For sure, but thats the point though isnt it? Its not supposed to be impossible. If it was, then just disable it being able to be stolen althogether
[6:46:42] owlx7: @Codex88 cool thanks... i thought he would do all 3 asap... i only seen the 1

[6:52:49] Beafour: @advancedwolverine Im unsure of what you mean tbh, but they way it was (theyve changed something already) they could take out a turbo within 5-10 seconds of getting into Moselys. Thats not enough time to even notice what they are doing. Extending it to 1+ min (need to be balanced) people will notice and have time to do something about it.

[7:34:09] Vorpalwarp: might be someone trying to actually have some fun
[7:34:35] DanLGG: that was clean
[7:34:35] Vorpalwarp: good recovery tbh
[7:34:45] Xellwrath: she almost said triple 1 hah
[7:34:53] riiftzzz: it's more fun when people dont just highway blast tbf
[7:35:31] Xellwrath: yes ofc
[7:35:52] Vorpalwarp: @riiftzzz yeah, i get that getting caught can mean days of progress being lost but imo the whole game is the cat and mouse
[7:36:34] Xellwrath: Also it doesn't really matter at this point because i'm pretty sure 4.0 will last until gta 6
[7:36:37] Fossabot: If your enjoying the stream smash the DAMN follow button! I mean shit its just a click away... Might see your name on screen ;)
[7:36:39] Vorpalwarp: whenever I played crim I wouldn't even try to lose them until 10-15 mins had elapsed
[7:36:48] sledgejustsold: EZ
[7:36:49] Xellwrath: maybe 5.0 nopixel will be in gta 6

[7:40:57] GigitySponges: Kappa
[7:41:07] Beafour: @Xellwrath Most likely, NoPixel 3.0 lasted 3 years, and GTAV PC launch was delayed 2 years compared to console exclusive launch.
[7:41:17] deaconblues7: i think you called same time as another unit
[7:41:22] deaconblues7: all good though
[7:41:31] JakeStratic: @chmbrs Seems most reasonable people agree 5 should be 3 and the speed should escalate. 1,3,5... but that is up to the admins to implement. Peeps going to use what they got
[7:41:51] DanLGG: Ssaab explained it last night on the post that cuffs will progressively get harder but for now they are easy enough that if someone joins the server today with gta experience they have a chance to break cuffs
[7:41:57] Beafour: @Xellwrath They probably have to decide now as well, so it would make sense to plan for GTA6
[7:42:30] josebellgaming: @Deansocool not gonna Jibe you hard here but i love the Switch between the RP chat and the Stream Chat you hating on Leonard to us but kissing his arse kinda ish. in RP....
