[7:21:34] x1juzzous: yep
[7:21:56] ptvgrjbdr: Gotta get a spot that u can only reach if u place something down and stand on it
[7:22:16] vewybig: @ZvidRvhim what?
[7:22:18] rustlebell: right but youre at proof of concept
[7:22:27] 8revolution: I‚Äôm eating a spicy enpanada PepegaSitSnack

[7:22:44] 8revolution: looks like it‚Äôs taking shape
[7:22:44] vewybig: rev hi
[7:22:50] zvidrvhim: @vewybig like place a barrel there when you need to take stuff but remove the barrel so no one can access it
[7:22:50] Wfbigb93: EZ

[7:22:59] no_name_jinkel: Ming 5Head
[7:23:07] zvidrvhim: @vewybig on the platform ontop of the bench
[7:23:09] Xpatrol: @ZvidRvhim that powergaming
[7:23:11] 8revolution: you sound tired af
[7:23:13] ImLokis: @ZvidRvhim Nidas said its good
[7:23:17] zvidrvhim: Exactly
[7:23:29] AWC_Tobi: using a door this way isnt? LUL
[7:23:30] 1evilshark: yeah. because you cant do it irl
[7:23:31] acterious: and also not as cool as fidget spinner vent
[7:23:31] n00shyyy: just powergame
[7:23:35] Drexun: ya...anyone has to be able to get to it if they figure it out
[7:23:36] ImLokis: but no with editor
[7:23:37] ptvgrjbdr: Its not power gaming if u can pace it down without the panel tho
[7:23:42] Xpatrol: If u need editor to access it  its powergaming
[7:23:48] 8revolution: @acterious Yurrr PotFriend
[7:23:50] hemmorj: huh
[7:23:52] rustlebell: @ZvidRvhim don't lie to lovemore
[7:23:53] Julian: is implementing a skill gap powergaming? like, a climb up like GSF roof?
[7:23:56] zvidrvhim: That's what i mean
[7:23:59] 8revolution: yeah
[7:24:00] yaroo____: @ming can you build a fake wall with a vent and crawl under it ?
[7:24:01] 8revolution: makes sense
[7:24:02] ImLokis: @Xpatrol ^
[7:24:06] Kloakheesten0: you cant climb up on placed floors?
[7:24:08] CourierV221: as long as other people can access it i think
[7:24:11] 8revolution: @imlokis Yurrr PotFriend
[7:24:20] rohehehe: make that door into a trapdoor that you stand on and fall down into a room then you have 1 barrel downstairs for loot and 1 barrel clipping through the roof so u can move items from barrel to barrel
[7:24:24] acterious: mf boutta make a gta parkour map for the stash
[7:24:28] pacollama: ye the rock thing is such a good idea
[7:24:33] ImLokis: PotFriend 8revolution
[7:24:38] zvidrvhim: @rustlebell whaat?
[7:24:38] sharky_00_: W IDEIA
[7:24:39] Leonaus_: you can make a ''fake secret entrance'' that just leads to an inescapable place or a fire where they die
[7:24:41] AWC_Tobi: can you use deez cane to open the door?
[7:24:41] acterious: @zaythor10 nobody watching lil bro

[7:25:21] thedandylife: @Leonaus_ A bait trap does sound pretty cool
[7:25:24] vewybig: i dont think they see chat after a ban
[7:25:32] bigpune: 8revolution POGGERS
[7:25:33] thehitman00000: can you make it tall enough where you must look through your eyes to get up
[7:25:35] rustlebell: lol it's a little like what a previous chatter said: make a gpu hole to trapper robbers into
[7:25:37] Thehairydude: how much money are you at?

[7:26:47] iZeeMo: concept idea but it looks like it would work
[7:26:52] harucanne: You can make secret stash in that ceiling tho
[7:26:53] AWC_Tobi: can you use the cane jack has to rotate that door? so you dont have to throw a rock @Ming
[7:27:02] acterious: they should make it where if u dont have a key you cant see those E icons
[7:27:03] Drexun: or a fake wall that can only be accessed by wall sneaking
[7:27:04] Vladdy: @Julian havent touched mine in ages cant be fucked
[7:27:11] Julian: same thats why @Vladdy
[7:27:11] Drexun: like, the gap
