[4:38:11] AlgaeMuddy: @EsfandTV  that is a tiptronic transmission.
[4:38:11] xseaka: is corvette supposed to be the speed car?
[4:38:12] science_envisions: my car is a CVT and it has paddleshifters for some reason

[4:38:40] BoldSlowbro: it might be your character, let someone else try it
[4:38:41] NarwhalArgy: I believe double clutch is what you're thinking of, which Fords and Ferrari have for their transmission, I think most sports cars use a DCT
[4:38:41] BoogieAnimal: This thing should go way faster than that
[4:38:41] Haleos_x: that should be hitting 200 easily

[4:39:06] cadGG: yeah on the highway
[4:39:07] iNF3RNO_ZA: Classic Motorcycle engine high revs & accel, low top speed with weight
[4:39:07] keemotherapi: I need to see someone else drive it
[4:39:07] permacool: Kappa
[4:39:09] masteredgar1000: Less weight and turbo make it faster
[4:39:10] Capn_Stew: corvette and supra seem weak

[4:39:17] jeffrey778: highway is best for this one
[4:39:18] srheinholtz: Small turbo would make it crazy in the city
[4:39:19] n0bunagga: need more gears
[4:39:19] MrBASins: the pickup was faster also
[4:39:19] nyxi998: it should prolly top out at 120ish with the way it handles rn
[4:39:20] Jaggsta: SAVED

[4:39:23] hippiecat: get Denzel to test drive the car and see how it goes in a chase?
[4:39:24] Doqx42: @eliteone11 I'm sure it has 8 speed, needs turbo to have the power to push into those gears
[4:39:25] Drackaine: cant lose speed when you dont have speed KEKW
[4:39:26] kingoffoxez: thats the limiter

[4:39:33] PokeMom019: Cruisin'
[4:39:34] Michael1337hax: downforce for days
[4:39:36] NarwhalArgy: @EsfandTV I wonder if you changing the transmission and shifting it would make it faster
[4:39:36] endobleedz: because you are doing 50mph slower
[4:39:40] goose__bag: @CapSobel I heard he had some personal issues of some kind so probably on a break
[4:39:41] Mindhysteria: ur catching up

[4:39:44] MaSTerSOra701: I wonder if thats just you, I cant imagine that car is actually that slow
[4:39:44] Bushwick78: well at least that good but the top speed is poo poo
[4:39:45] Shakeboxing: Wide body vettes are amazing on the road, you should buy one IRL @EsfandTV :)
[4:39:45] Kiester_Felterbutts: Corners like it's on rails
[4:39:48] curiouscoalmine: it's cornwood, he breaks cars
[4:39:48] Fabushki: can't catch the cppi
[4:39:49] Strangemitts: @jeffrey778 how? the top speed sucks. It handles great and loses less speed in turns so it would be better in the city
[4:39:49] MaSTerSOra701: Ive seen those kind of cars blaze
[4:39:49] BroKnucks: c7 corvettes have dual clutch so the Manumatic is as good if not better. 170 minimum should be top speed tho….
[4:39:49] iNF3RNO_ZA: no plate = dap
[4:39:52] vicious_pen: yeah devs need to fix these f
[4:39:53] sKingNA: Gear ratios are all wrong

[4:40:23] Pkelove: this car is really good just not crazy speed but gotta be balanced
[4:40:25] Fast_doughnut: is it good for going in and out of traffic
[4:40:25] ZappinR6: @NarwhalArgy You arent wrong but the  type of transmission isnt as important. single clutch automatic and even some cvts can have manual gear selection
[4:40:30] nuudelz: bricked speedo?
[4:40:31] Bushwick78: turns on a dime at least
[4:40:32] ScyThE619: city car def
[4:40:35] vicious_pen: true, but I'd def tell the devs to take a look
[4:40:38] Haleos_x: just up the top speed and its great
[4:40:39] kingjoely: sacrifice speed for handling
[4:40:39] CrystalDimension: @sterred what does that mean ? were there dashcams (actual video)?
[4:40:40] PeterPanTheKing: idk the top speed is staight ass
[4:40:41] MrBASins: the good for highway chases

[4:41:12] iAmDuckie: that and the supra would be good with turbo
[4:41:13] Cerkins: top at 135 with 88 turbo would be perfect
[4:41:13] NarwhalArgy: @ZappinR6 I guess that's correct since my Honda has one as well

It knows this because it knows where it isn't, by subtracting where it is, from where it isn't, or where it isn't, from where it is, whichever is greater, it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance sub-system uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is, to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is.

It knows this because it knows where it isn't, by subtracting where it is, from where it isn't, or where it isn't, from where it is, whichever is greater, it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance sub-system uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is, to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is.
