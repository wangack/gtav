[2:55:00] jordeon123: He was "As Chief" in 3.0

[2:59:57] Canahealz: but knight was able to come back

[3:00:12] StreamElements: timmacHI
[3:00:16] TheRealTweex: no ziggy either
[3:00:21] Atrociousnes: That's silly seeing as so many other that were brought back
[3:00:26] jordeon123: Ya it was a weird RP reset and check at the same time idk was a weird but semi understandable choice in a sense
[3:00:51] BurnsFPS: Guess it was somewhat about giving it a general refresh, although its interested alot coming back now
[3:01:01] Atrociousnes: @jordeon123 it's more of the fact that they they didn't hold everyone to that standard
[3:01:03] JoeSizzle7: Originally they didn't want old drama or mainly egos about old ranks etc. then started to give in
[3:01:07] jordeon123: @Atrociousnes Ya and it is weird that not new people was accepted idk, was weird but understandable
[3:01:10] GeorgeVanSmooth: Only thing that would make sense to me is that they did not want ppl to fall into their regular 3.0 RP styles.
[3:01:10] Lord_Legolas: probably some captains that wasn't happy with old characters
[3:01:16] jordeon123: @Atrociousnes Ya i get it and agree YEP
[3:01:17] amzz96: it'd be interesting to know how they decided who's coming back

[3:01:47] Fighting465: what do you think bout the prison take over
[3:01:55] Lepaca: NP and communication KEKW
[3:02:09] jocifer: question is any of the old people in pd former HC
[3:02:27] Atrociousnes: All the people who had to change didn't they all also try other servers pure speculation but that's what it seems like the people who weren't loyal were denied and then had to make new
[3:02:37] jordeon123: It was top tier rp right after delcaring the prison lawless YEP great timing
[3:02:37] TheRealTweex: It just goes to show how god tier he is turning that situation into the gold RP that is K town
[3:02:40] TheSwunk: Brian Knight blew up EMS and got to come back KEKW

[3:03:17] ArkDota2: What in the world lol
[3:03:30] jordeon123: @Atrociousnes Seems like that was a semi problem, now that dark is now accepted it seems like maybe they are loosening that? We'll see
[3:03:47] Atrociousnes: Very possible
[3:03:50] jordeon123: @Atrociousnes I hope so at least
[3:04:14] Destroses5100: yeah its not even that long after meeting and it died off real quick
[3:04:21] LimmieBasher: could it be a memory thing? like Mack would already know all the old criminals. Liam has to meet them
[3:04:30] jocifer: funny because if i remember rightyou got hired to be fast tracked and made a fto to help
[3:04:59] jocifer: i think your just being overlooked somhow
[3:05:00] TheNachoManRandyCabbage: lotta different people want a lotta different stuff. Just do you son
[3:05:03] jordeon123: @Atrociousnes Seems like they didnt trust the creator to do new rp and not stick to the same character even when making a new one. Maybe they are testing. I hope theyll trust the RPer to be able to be another character YEP
[3:05:09] jordeon123: idk just imo
[3:05:16] Simbarchi: @jocifer That what I remember as well.
[3:05:37] SirGO0SE: It feels like different people are in charge of choosing who gets to come back and who doesn't, rather than one person
[3:05:42] TheRealTweex: I think at the start they wanted to mold a new idea of the PD that was more "by the book" but it hasn't worked out well as they found out

[3:54:55] Juiicer: honestly, if you want to own a house and don‚Äôt care about the outside world, an HOA isn‚Äôt terrible.
[3:55:00] JoppaChoppz: Its called Makelaars in TheNetherlands

[3:55:53] JoppaChoppz: Gotcha
[3:55:57] xTegra: @Davedahuh we technically do as well, the HoA is just the first barrier to parts of local government
[3:56:05] CRITIKAL_SPEED: i have realized HOA would hate me I might be the nightmare neighbor
[3:56:44] sychotixx: HOA is basically a group of house owners got together to agree to a set of rules and community things. Usually there are dues to pay for the admin/community things
[3:56:49] Lepaca: She is so great LUL
[3:56:52] Davedahuh: @xTegra shit seems authoritarian
