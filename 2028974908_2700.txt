[6:20:47] despicablewebb: BlackFireCowboy because they can charge more for it and it costs them fuck all to make omE
[6:20:51] FaramirRat: @BlackFireCowboy yea cause they pre-make a bunch of pepperoni pizza's before rush, to use a cheese only one takes away from a order that doesn't want pepperoni.
[6:21:05] BlackFireCowboy: which would make it the default order no?
[6:21:05] zerk159: toonyPopcorn
[6:21:16] dragon_philosopher: toonySip

[6:22:33] xprnstr_twitch: is shxtou with the gang now?
[6:22:39] BlackFireCowboy: sometimes just pepperoni is good, lets you taste the mozza more but i agree usually the more meat the better
[6:22:40] anovi1235: @dragon_philosopher yup, Timothy in GTA
[6:22:44] FaramirRat: I've done delivery for domino's for 4 years straight back in my younger days, was making 25 - 30 dollars an hour doing it too. Pepperoni is by far the most ordered topping, its not even close.
