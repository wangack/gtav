[2:26:13] Drackaine: @Lesbifriend yes the problem is in the issuing of the ID, which should come with a photo, bad/lazy implementation of the mechanic

We can have eternal life in Heaven if we accept the truth , just have to believe it with all your heart and confess are sins , even are thoughts can be wicked which is a sin but the holy Spirit within will guide you threw it all if you walk that narrow path . Its easy to get caught up in this world but its harder to walk that path that's why few are chosen .

[8:31:37] k1nneDECIR: SeemsGood
[8:31:40] Vallhan: @Ricanelite Agreed 100%, they missed a easy 6 points from not taking the field goals and could be winnable if they did so.
[8:31:42] BullPot: This was the Lions year, them repeating a run like this anytime soon unlikely
[8:31:50] k1nneDECIR: Captain Slacks. o7
[8:31:59] TheKingOfWit: is he saying the hitbox is bigger than the visual?
[8:32:00] skympii: just shoot the tires at this point

[8:32:05] VenatusVox: @itsEinsburg Mount Cornwood
[8:32:05] MysticCasey: About 2 Cornwoods YEP
[8:32:07] inducedcatharsis: They are gonna see that though no?
[8:32:10] aner_: you just have to think about it like its deploying in real time and not instantly
[8:32:13] Grilbur: But you slide spikes, you don't drop them
[8:32:15] lankybreak: they dont come down though they fucking slide out, this makes no damn sense
[8:32:15] nosticktoaster: how far in cornwoods
[8:32:16] E_Turn_UL: 2 Cornwidths
[8:32:18] flamingchinchilla: LIONS Pog no way

[8:32:55] Toastedgamer03: but this is gta rp you need to be respectful to the crims and be super nice
[8:32:56] 360ski: Catch the bird
[8:32:57] EvilCoatrack: real life they're across the lane pulling them over just before the car hits
[8:32:57] MackPlays: I‚Äôm real life it has a chain you pull it
[8:32:58] Naruto_AMV_from_2007: and more often than not they end up spiking the cruisers too LUL
[8:32:58] MoistMouthMags: aDAPt
[8:33:00] CapSobel: that was spot on tho
[8:33:00] Neekapkilla: he wants it to be used tactically instead of as a melee basically for gaming reasons
[8:33:00] Revdudeson: lions are edging rn
[8:33:02] Ricanelite: @Vallhan and all blame is on the coach even thoiugh one of those 4th downs should have been caught but in games like this points you need to take
[8:33:03] TheAzazelGoat: no they deploy first then pull last second for the most part
[8:33:03] shmeeso: DAP for different tactics? Susge
[8:33:04] TonyT475: Yeah
[8:33:05] Neekapkilla: exactly exactly balancing
[8:33:05] BrainOnAutopilot: that or get ran over when they're going fast
[8:33:06] DarkheroGaming: Admins must want to give them a chance
[8:33:07] HazyHung: Real life they get the fuck away because it's dangerous
[8:33:07] Joongi_: But this is a content serves Esfand LUL
[8:33:09] cheebah710: esfandCozy
[8:33:09] DarkheroGaming: Yeah
[8:33:09] k1nneDECIR: SeemsGood
[8:33:10] BeaverCiv: He doesn't want it deployed through the middle of the car
[8:33:11] destr0yer_7: YEP
[8:33:11] CrystalDimension: Exception = SBS Evilge
[8:33:15] Wandering_Ranger: gotta make sure you give the crims every chance to get away LUL
[8:33:15] LoudPackNoReefa: you can‚Äôt put a spike in between the wheel irl. they place them in front and the car drives over
[8:33:15] Lordrune13: YEAH
[8:33:16] Gachiguru: the spike strips are so small
[8:33:19] King0fKhaos: but its not balancing... they can get out of 99% of boxes
[8:33:19] 1CaptainRedBeard1: Honestly, right now I feel like spikes aren't great with how they get used.
[8:33:19] nosticktoaster: they just gonna drive around
[8:33:20] 13nox__: yea that would be too OP for sure
[8:33:21] RoryBear: ask him if its okay for big ehicles
[8:33:21] DezpicableD: just want AMSB TD...will win a nasty parlay
[8:33:22] cookiez_n_corndogz: it's just more bs nerfing for PD, like everything else
[8:33:22] farts_mcgeee: but irl they are op
[8:33:23] Scottycky: just think if crimms did that LUL
[8:33:23] Blackfin__: you cant deploy them nearly as fast irl so no they dont do that
[8:33:23] delba_doh: I want the Lions to win, going for it o. 4th and 3 in the red zone may have failed but was a decent strategy
[8:33:25] lankybreak: i get trying to balance it but he should have a better way of wording it
[8:33:25] panhever: cops are balancing way too hard only shooting themselves into foot
[8:33:27] KYslippy: spikes also don't 'pop' tires
[8:33:27] CrystalDimension: Exception = SBS Power Hour *  Evilge
[8:33:27] masteredgar1000: Slacks method is ineffective
[8:33:28] nimbleop: crims spend very little time in jail is op
[8:33:30] PoisonDart11: PepeLaugh when u tried deploying spikes on that dump truck
[8:33:30] PatrickMaybe: the spike strips are not op tho LULE
[8:33:30] Smoogol: mhm
[8:33:34] PsycloneTM: HOW IN REAL LIFE CAN THEY THROW IT THROUGH THE CAR Pepega Clap take by esfand
[8:33:35] Toastedgamer03: it just makes the spike trip useless
[8:33:36] cidrean: it's balanced, your cop cars suck
[8:33:36] fleshhy: The spikes are really small now compared to 3.0
[8:33:36] moodymellow: Me :(
[8:33:38] Celestial990: KEKW
[8:33:38] icephrogg: i dont think anyone has pulled off a spike strip play yet
[8:33:39] Panthi: but if u can't do it that close it's going to be too easy to just avoid it lol
[8:33:40] Jayaos: they seem hard to place decently tho, should be some leeway

[8:33:57] Welshstig: just slide it underneath car
[8:33:58] DezalbM: they need to be bigger for sure
[8:33:59] taraannee: i dont think a single thing yall do is ever op considering u almost never catch ppl in chases LUL
[8:33:59] HazyHung: The cop wouldn't be close to the spikes when the car hits it too. It's dangerous. They might get hit
[8:34:00] DezpicableD: now you have to  burn a TD
[8:34:01] VenatusVox: Its more rewarding to spike a vehicle the proper way
[8:34:05] PoisonDart11: @PsycloneTM do u understand how spikes work in real life? LULE

[8:34:39] Titan2TT: kylie use to be a cop right?
[8:34:40] ItsYojimbo: spikes are nearly impossible to use as a set-up tactic when the crim sjust turn left and right at every single side street
[8:34:45] MrDher: Lions NOOO
[8:34:45] ev3_t_t: Seemed like he was sating u cant spike as suspect is pulling away from a stop
[8:34:46] Drackaine: https://youtu.be/UY5QqTJXq3E?t=63 STRIPS IRL
[8:34:47] Shonuff_: Lions have a small chance, need the onside kick

[8:35:19] Xian_TV: if you can't use spikes that way, then i think they need to reduce the cast time on them in pursuits because the second they see a cop standing for the 5 sec cast time they just immediately change course

[14:32:00] TheSlike123: on a bigger truck irl you would have 60-88mm but thats for tourque through the whole power band since they have good low end torque they need big ones for torque in the high rpms @EsfandTV
[14:32:11] SavageTarzan: lookUp essaying

[16:28:59] Kaisenjin: The hospital staff doesn't help either, they shouldn't go out catching suspects and healing them
[16:29:18] fabi_1211: PogU esfand is so nice, he streams also for EU peoples
[16:29:27] eklu65: @Kaisenjin they shouldn't be reviving without officers saying it's ok

[16:33:56] PoisonDart11: @Kaisenjin the ems' job is to help the downed. all they got a call for was downed people. not a crime scene. since the police were on scene first, they could've told them to wait. they told them to heal them anyways. its not the ems fault they were cuffed.
