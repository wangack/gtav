[1:31:10] veriquay: almost like when cops irl shoot people cause they think it’s their taser oop
[1:31:22] APHSnake: I looked away for one second and penny shot him
[1:31:31] catfish_quackenbush: @captain_steve_420 from what i caught, penny thought she had her tazer out, and dommed that dude
[1:31:36] skinnylegend000: Pennys first day not going so well
[1:31:46] SoulYou_: imo that shot would 100% defend itself in court tbh
[1:31:53] captain_steve_420: No shot... holy....
[1:32:06] random_viewer_55: @SoulYou_ probably not
[1:32:11] TheBFG_01: well… guess that’s gonna be the last time McNulty trusts the other FTOs before advancing another cadet

[1:32:14] Nightbot: Chat, remember this is a video game, Custard and anyone else in the server are playing characters.. The character's actions and words do not apply to their streamers nothing said or done is personal or OOC.. Please sit back, chill, and enjoy the RP ltcustLove
[1:32:17] random_viewer_55: @SoulYou_ it depends on the McNulty's testimony
[1:32:19] VectorFalcon: Well, cops have done time for mistaking gun for taser IRL.  We will see what happens in NoPixel
[1:32:32] straysinger_music: stay cozy chat it's all rp ltcustCozy

[1:35:49] Chickenplucker26: Penny gonna get a wooden training gun now
[1:35:53] bobdang07hd: bout time someone shot people have wrenches out constantly
[1:36:07] devintalktech: So maybe the RP laws/sops are different than IRL in the states. Wrench is considered a dealy weapon, so if someone moves towards you with it after making threats, you can use deadly force no?
[1:36:10] catfish_quackenbush: @Chickenplucker26 lol like cornwood in early 3.0
[1:36:11] Brewserker: seqWelp
[1:36:15] joel_alex: She took the shot, So American… 🇺🇸
[1:36:20] devintalktech: Not hopping, I watch you a lot and lurk but i'm curious about it

[1:36:32] Cultivated: Will she be fired over this
[1:36:37] jinnytolls: It also means potential breakup
[1:36:41] SoulYou_: @devintalktech i would agree with that, but the PD approach in the server is very lenient
[1:36:50] freen87: gotta admit. she saved you
[1:36:50] devintalktech: especially with 10 years of public safety, the shoot would be justified... that was until she said i thought I had a tazer which then is fucked LUL

[5:19:49] jdoug4444: @roosterregal you could watch vods of the old cops you like
[5:19:50] Kelborn: Id lvoe to apply myself, but I havent RPed a lto on GTA and I feel like the learning curve would take a bit

[5:21:49] AlteredData: KermitChat
[5:21:59] RoosterRegal: Many have applied.... And how many have actually been given jobs? Don't be afraid to lose your spot. Plenty of spots to go around bro. There is absolutely nothing wrong with bringing back experienced cops that did a fine job previously. I'm not trying to be an ass, just speaking truth. Nostalgia is a good thing. ESPECIALLY in this case.
[5:22:01] ros3ishh: howody keencamb20002
[5:22:05] Clodhoppr: ooc she was trying to repair car and her mdt kept pulling out halfway at the same time

[5:22:35] RoosterRegal: Nostalgia is beautiful.
[5:22:42] VSDuck: essaying
[5:22:48] Lilliphus: nostalgia is a drug
[5:22:50] RoosterRegal: Like a double rainbow.
[5:22:51] magnets_: he's not afraid to lose his spot lmfao
[5:22:51] Despoiler98: nostalgia is pointless and useless
[5:22:54] Reserter1938: essaying
[5:23:00] themanwithanrx7: essaying
[5:23:00] ros3ishh: nostalgia is a fantasy that can never be re-created YesYes
[5:23:01] amzz96: change is also beautiful
[5:23:01] Kelborn: Nostalgia is fine unless you let it paralyze you into doing nothing at all
[5:23:02] SimplyOrt: @RoosterRegal there is a difference in old characters and their streamers
[5:23:04] warmachine89: essaying
[5:23:20] lynnchesque: back in MY day we didn't believe in nostalgia
[5:23:33] MFaustus: Nostalgia is crack for old people
[5:23:33] Lilliphus: @lynnchesque i legit snorted
[5:23:42] jdoug4444: If you like nostalgia that much go watch vods or look through YouTube and find shit from 1.0-3.0
[5:23:47] alyx_bunny43: Okay chat I'm heading to bed now ltcustLove ltcustLove goodnight everyone ltcustZzzz ltcustCozy
[5:23:50] RoosterRegal: It's 2024. Nostalgia is everything.
[5:23:51] Kelborn: Jason Peters? Former Offensive tackle for the Philadelphia Eagles?
[5:23:55] random_viewer_55: @RoosterRegal it's boring to see the same characters year after year after year.
[5:24:01] SimplyOrt: @RoosterRegal so weird??? what does that mean
[5:24:02] Nightbot: Come join the discord and fill up the ranks! https://discord.gg/PMrxK3F
[5:24:05] VSDuck: @RoosterRegal Nostalgia is great to look back on but not act on especially in this case when the PD are trying to build a "new, non-corrupt" pd
[5:24:09] UncreativName: if nostalgia is everything you live a sad life
[5:24:09] RoosterRegal: Especially in the case of Nopixel 4.0 PD
[5:24:20] Kelborn: I thiink comfort is the real killer
[5:24:24] warmachine89: Nostalgia is why we keep getting shitty remakes of old video games. Take a lap chatter.
[5:24:25] ros3ishh: theres still 3.0 vods YesYes
[5:24:28] random_viewer_55: @RoosterRegal I'm was bored of seeing the same cops again and again. The only reason I"m watching is because most of PD is new
[5:24:28] Lilliphus: "the pd is the worst it's ever been" is something i've been hearing every day since i started watching in 2.0
[5:24:31] DancerRonin: “Remember, if you run from the cops and make them come get you,  they are bringing an ass whooping with them.”
[5:24:33] maggsrags: I remember when cigarettes and coke were good for you
[5:24:38] Despoiler98: @RoosterRegal then go back and rewatch all your fave 3.0 vods and live in the past
[5:24:42] Reserter1938: agreed @kelborn
[5:24:51] magnets_: ive been watching old 3.0 videos of car chases just cos the cars were better
[5:24:51] alexandrarose13: weird take but ok
[5:24:54] themanwithanrx7: this chatter acts like a bunch of OG PD didn't already come back with new characters
[5:25:03] RoosterRegal: Do you have a problem with the 3.0 PD? Did you not watch? Shit was golden.
[5:25:04] SimplyOrt: @RoosterRegal nopixel has hundreds of thousands of viewers we dont care if you dont like it
[5:25:05] yunietoons: sniffthenewchatter
[5:25:11] servinglamb247: Nostalgia = weird chatters
[5:25:13] AndresSaysHey: This mans talking like Custy wasn't part of 3.0 PD on a different character
[5:25:14] MonosOG: I miss watching past iterations of sports teams. Things change cuz they have to
[5:25:15] Lilliphus: @RoosterRegal he WAS 3.0 pd my dude
[5:25:16] skinnylegend000: he was high command PD 3.0
[5:25:18] SimplyOrt: HE WAS 3.0 PD
[5:25:18] Kaelath_The_Red: @warmachine89 PepeLaugh I mean new games are just shitty even without being a remake
[5:25:19] Nico_47: One day this will be the nostalgia. And then we must let it die
[5:25:20] Despoiler98: Other than the RAMPANT Corruption?
[5:25:22] VSDuck: @RoosterRegal AAAA HE DOESN'T KNOW
[5:25:29] spuds3432: AAAA
[5:25:29] Nightbot: AAAA
[5:25:30] Kelborn: 3.0 PD doesnt exist anymore homie
[5:25:30] magnets_: EL NO SABE
[5:25:32] maggsrags: AAAA
[5:25:34] APHSnake: AAAA
[5:25:34] DancerRonin: When the chatter has no clue.
[5:25:35] warmachine89: @warmachine89 Shhhh! Don't undermine my point KEKW
[5:25:35] RoosterRegal: Don't remember you in 3.0.
[5:25:39] jdoug4444: So watch 3.0 vods or search YouTube for nopixel 3.0
[5:25:42] UncreativName: Literally command of 3.0 PD AAAA
[5:25:48] Lilliphus: @RoosterRegal yeah because he made a new character KEKW he played sweets
[5:25:51] RoosterRegal: I'm gonna subscribe just so you don't think I'm trolling.
[5:25:52] Despoiler98: @RoosterRegal Lieutenant Jerry Sweets, high command
[5:25:59] Clodhoppr: @roosterregal then you decided not to stick around the entire time lmao
[5:26:02] Kaelath_The_Red: Madge PD is the worst it's ever been, they still haven't hired me
[5:26:10] SimplyOrt: damn i think youre lying custard he doesnt remember you
[5:26:13] BurgGolf: if this is a “real” fight why didn’t the other officers step in and detain K for assaulting an officer
[5:26:14] inducedcatharsis: SHITSHOW
[5:26:19] skinnylegend000: he was Jerry Sweets the loud guy who ate his weight in carrot cake every day.
[5:26:30] magnets_: they wanted a new pd for 4.0. new characters new storylines. simple as that
[5:26:31] DancerRonin: The PD was never the same after they fired Cherry!   I said what I said.
[5:26:37] Lilliphus: officer carrot cake, foot pursuit god who developed diabetes Sadge
[5:26:40] Skullthrone1: I got something against McNulty's looks cause DAAAMN lookin fiine~
[5:26:50] warmachine89: @skinnylegend000 Ate so much carrot cake he gained Flash-like super speed, and also diabetes
[5:27:21] inducedcatharsis: I miss Turner, I hope everything is good with him Sadge
[5:27:23] Nico_47: Is ruby brown haired or redheaded?
[5:27:25] DiaBeetusKoby: @lilliphus wait sweets is who I have to blame for my life’s problems?
[5:27:28] RoosterRegal: What I'm saying is that is appears that good former cops have applied and are still waiting on their applications. That's really my point and I think that was Esfand's point too. That's what I believe he meant when he referred to nostalgia.
[5:27:37] Lilliphus: @Nico_47 auburn, brown with reddish highlights
[5:27:40] RoosterRegal: And the PD now is thin.
[5:27:44] warmachine89: The most iconic Jerry moment for me is still Booba hot dropping Jerry on top of some criminals and them being fucking shocked he was there.
[5:27:56] Clodhoppr: it’s still sooo early on rn
[5:27:57] Sanitet: thin isnt a bad thing
[5:27:58] magnets_: it's thin by design. it's a story.
[5:28:00] RoosterRegal: You guys are growing.. agreed.
[5:28:01] OminousEinherjar: Sweets ate so much carrot cake that Custard's new character became a carrot top
[5:28:04] Clodhoppr: they need to develop the story
[5:28:06] frostysail: 4.0 is trying to do something different which is good
[5:28:07] spuds3432: Takes time to build a strong foundation
[5:28:10] Hixxie_TV: PD is slow rolling into place
[5:28:18] Reserter1938: The PD is in a much better spot than when you guys first started for sureeeee
[5:28:19] themanwithanrx7: if the PD started out with 100 cops, people would be crying about it
[5:28:21] magnets_: KEKW
[5:28:22] inducedcatharsis: LULW Content
[5:28:22] Kaelath_The_Red: whipLewd your growing and your hard

[5:28:31] PlethoraOfBees: 2.5 PPOs OK
[5:28:32] OminousEinherjar: And its by design, it creats awesome RP. Loving the struggling PD
[5:28:39] alexandrarose13: what do y’all do to make ppl wanna join or stay in the first place tho? it’s like actual work
[5:28:42] MFaustus: @roosterregal some of those are waiting for a reason, or were told to roll a new cop, snow is already in as a cadet
[5:28:57] frostysail: Madge  get to the 180 mph chases now!
[5:29:06] VSDuck: @PlethoraOfBees AAAA
[5:29:12] Clodhoppr: ltcustHappyCustard ltcustHappyCustard
[5:29:17] RoosterRegal: And I'm not trying to be overly negative. I'm just saying good cops are waiting. That's all. I'm not articulate... That's obvious.
[5:29:18] warmachine89: Madge supercar gunfights when Madge
[5:29:20] Reserter1938: trueeeeee just a game
[5:29:20] LJD420: True with that being said Ruth is a negative CarlSmile
[5:29:34] Nico_47: Soon this will be the nostalgia of building 4.0 pd early days lol
[5:29:38] DiaBeetusKoby: rp’ing a pd that got destroyed by 3.0 cops.. chatters: why aren’t all the 3.0 cops already cops? it’s all rp
[5:29:39] Kaelath_The_Red: CollinSuffer I almost reinstalled Siege tonight then I remembered how shit it was after year 5
[5:29:43] DiaBeetusKoby: !rp
[5:29:43] Nightbot: Chat, remember this is a video game, Custard and anyone else in the server are playing characters.. The character's actions and words do not apply to their streamers nothing said or done is personal or OOC.. Please sit back, chill, and enjoy the RP ltcustLove
[5:29:50] oreosnatchnugget: good things take time.
[5:29:54] PhantmK: @frostysail  OVDM
[5:29:58] DancerRonin: There’s actually a psychological thing that humans are programmed to more vividly remember and internalize negative experiences than positive ones.
[5:30:09] SimplyOrt: @RoosterRegal if i had to guess there's a ton of info about the waiting cops you and me  as a viewer arent aware of, just sit back and watch everything will be fine
[5:30:18] RoosterRegal: RoosterRegal subscribed at Tier 1.

[5:30:47] SimplyOrt: ooh how was the new bed btw
[5:30:49] Nico_47: Did you meet more crims on nonpixel or working in a kitchen?
[5:31:01] skinnylegend000: it’s not common for people to not make it thru academy. it’s more common they go thru academy and decide it’s not for them.
[5:31:06] VSDuck: @RoosterRegal welcome to RP and those players either having to wait or making the decision to wait.. again RP reasons all around (can't force people to do things)
[5:31:10] Lilliphus: this man pulling a bazza rn KEKW
[5:31:18] itou_lovelace: Have you broken in your new Bed? sannsERP
[5:31:22] RoosterRegal: @simplyort you may have a point. I'm still watching.huge Nopixel fan.
[5:31:25] DancerRonin: Hey Custy,  what’s your thought on the saying “Going to a skinny chef is like going to a bald barber”
[5:31:33] Lilliphus: talking to chat instead of listening to the meeting classic
[5:31:59] Grimzzly3D: @itou_lovelace if he cookin i volunteer as tribute
[5:32:30] DancerRonin: In his defense a lot of meetings should just be emails.

[6:02:37] VSDuck: @HibikiHikariVT ScaredyCat
[6:02:44] VSDuck: peepoRun
[6:03:04] HibikiHikariVT: @VSDuck :p
[6:03:49] warmachine89: When you indulge in nostalgia, you forget all the negatives to justify the rosy image in your head, when in reality the past had problems too. Just different problems, that we solved and replaced with the present's problems.

[6:13:19] magnets_: oof
[6:13:50] magnets_: and aiming for head vs center mass
[6:14:23] plawpsruby: This situation Is worse than Johnson so would she get more than 3 daps
[6:14:32] BattleAlpaca: its so tough idk what i would do, rping out scuff with daps is so long consequences
[6:14:34] Scrando: A dap with the possibility to remove upon completion of retraining?
[6:14:46] random_viewer_55: @plawpsruby but they don't know that ic
[6:14:59] magnets_: eh johnson's was intentional, hers was a mistake + needs firearms training

[8:17:23] STLHawks: Bees, just drive the TRX and you'll wake up
[8:18:04] PlethoraOfBees: @STLHawks Nothing wakes me up in the morning. I got a call this morning that my car I ordered 2 years ago was built yesterday and I postponed my happiness and went back to sleep for another hour

[8:19:01] PhantmK: @STLHawks Serious thought, you might want to look into a Sleep Study, might have a sleeping disorder
[8:19:19] STLHawks: @STLHawks That's actually good advice Phantm
[8:19:35] STLHawks: my partner did one and we discovered MANY things about sleep

[8:22:29] Kaelath_The_Red: monkaW mm's away from dying horribly
[8:22:34] random_viewer_55: @STLHawks it's the same. Human body resistance is constant so volts are the ones that define how much Amps go through
[8:22:58] PhantmK: I loved power rangers as a kid but never ate worms
[8:23:15] I3eCynical: dont take that kid fishing
