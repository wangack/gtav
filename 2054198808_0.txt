[1:29:21] adzse: In 1805, British poet Lord Byron studied at Trinity college in Cambridge, the college authorities told him that he couldn’t bring his pet dog with him as dogs were banned. Lord Byron was so annoyed by this that he brought a pet bear with him instead! He argued that the rules didn’t say anything about keeping a pet bear and surprisingly won the argument. He keep the bear with him in his room and would also walk the bear around the college gorund on a leash. dizzTHINK
