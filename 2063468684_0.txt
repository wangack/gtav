[0:23:49] tehbigmadbarbarian: first season of OPM anime I liked a lot
[0:23:49] Scpoii: FRIEREN would be a fantastic starter anime since it's a lot like LOTR
[0:23:52] sterowentUS: one punch man is the ultimate story that isn't about being strong at all

[1:48:17] lundo2fundo: Some one the small streamers are some of the funniest RPers @kyle
[1:48:19] AUXdub: mixer paid them and twitch got them back in 6 months
[1:48:20] imShabby: honestly
[1:48:20] 50_tiger: Because the cost to stream is insane
[1:48:21] bruhkewl: They want bigger margins.
[1:48:24] s0upes: they need to pay you more man. you deserve it!!!!
[1:48:24] SargeAngel: @lundo2fundo thanks man
[1:48:26] Shaggymatt: Yeah, that worked out so well for mixer and fb gaming...
[1:48:27] PATCHEZinSPACE: my I’m trying oookkk twitch hates me
[1:48:27] 50_tiger: esp in 1080 format
[1:48:28] badboyrogue: ther servers cost several billion a year in evnergy cost alone
[1:48:29] Bkacjios: it costs a fuckton to stream and store video though
[1:48:30] JonEFive: not just ads, but subs, gift subs, bits, etc.....
[1:48:31] DrSnyder86: they have plenty of money! they just arent sharing

[1:48:34] GIaci: it's probably not as profitable as they want it to be, that's all
[1:48:34] GS_Leviathan: streamer doesn't understand bandwidth & server cost
[1:48:35] sterowentUS: they're not broke at all, they use amazon servers, an in house server for amazon in general
[1:48:36] Regzen: Soupes knows FeelsStrongMan
[1:48:37] lundo2fundo: @sargeangel FR tho
[1:48:38] TheGladiator2212: I mean as long as Bezos lets the employees pee
[1:48:38] Narcissicm: lol soupes
[1:48:40] VR_Viking: live streaming is expensive, especially when there's thousands of people doing it 24/7
[1:48:40] Phitness_: Its like when movie studios say they lost money on a movie cus they cook the books but they really made billions
[1:48:41] BullPot: Honestly I can't remember the last time I followed a streamer, pretty much just watch what I have now
[1:48:42] Wells30: Twitch as a entity is broke - the parent company (Amazon) subsidies the cost
[1:48:42] AUXdub: content and exposure are platform based.
[1:48:43] ezeref_27: They are broke since jeff bezos needs all the money they make for another 300FT yacht
[1:48:44] RetepYalc: s0upes riding already smh
[1:48:49] boolove: EVIDENCE
[1:48:51] Hanglow365: it's just good accounting from them that's all. like when amazon never made any money KEKwAIT
[1:48:52] Pushamang: amazon could make it free for twitch and make it profitable
[1:48:53] Bendosuff: prolly just invested all the profit so it looks like they dont make money
[1:48:53] gaavriel_: did you? KEKW
[1:48:54] OptimusJon: It costs a ton for Twitch to run per stream, Kyle

[1:49:04] cyberneticpandas: The servers that "They own"
[1:49:05] Shaggymatt: @pushamang wrong
[1:49:05] boolove: chat doesnt understand how parent corporations work
[1:49:07] spAnser: Them trying to put encoding multiple qualities on the streamers computer is basically them trying to cut costs for transcoding servers.
[1:49:07] bazzela: Classic expert chatters
[1:49:12] Proloe: And?
[1:49:12] Kathula: video hosting is not cheap
[1:49:12] Tylermcd93: ?????
[1:49:14] SargeAngel: paying their own servers lol theyre getting them at cost
[1:49:15] mr_deepsense_: What about a kick deal
[1:49:21] DrSnyder86: twitch doesnt own any servers
[1:49:24] zigzagg88: They were broke they wouldn't let any1 stream it be the ones making money
[1:49:25] lundo2fundo: Twitch is rich af
[1:49:26] rogerechodelta: Isn't twitch an Amazon company?  Doesn't Amazon own the servers?
[1:49:29] Lephus: @kyle Amazon is public it can’t lie about their money flow
[1:49:31] sterowentUS: they claim the servers as a separate entity for tax purposes and negotiation tactics. no company creates an in house production of a resource and considers those resources with out of company prices
[1:49:32] AWildChocobo: kick culture sucks
[1:49:35] ShrimpCommander: amazon/twitch 100 has special internet bandwidth discount 4Head how do people all the sudden don't think billionare+ don't get cheap rates

[1:49:41] gaavriel_: PEPW
[1:49:42] Tetevor: chat acting like AWS doesn't own half the fking internet
[1:49:43] feenx__sama: @rogerechodelta my thoughts exactly
[1:49:44] Phitness_: Kick is for degen streamers that have no where else to go
[1:49:44] yellowdish: Kick is for complete degenerates
[1:49:44] Ohiosveryown: kick is only Just Chatting and W/L community
[1:49:45] OtterFightingClub: Thats what always confused me about the people that do the "math" on server cost. They aren't paying the same amount as a normal company would
[1:49:45] Love4donuts: you dont punch kids?
[1:49:45] theyogster15: you fit in more than you think @kyle
[1:49:45] mininni94: Did you see that video about Kick and the riotlol stuff?
[1:49:46] Kathula: Doesnt mean Amazon wants a bleeding money subsidary
