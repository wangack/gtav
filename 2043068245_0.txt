[0:29:47] vipslampy15: Why wouldnt the largest streaming platform follow a wellcknown bollywood star?
[0:30:07] BakinPacman: that is fair on their end to be honest
[0:30:08] Darthremar: yeah a lot of prime subs are worth f all now
[0:31:01] BakinPacman: its good that it is detailed that much
[0:31:04] ChiefLongsword: a twtch streamer tweeted a breakdown on the impacts. I could link if you want
[0:31:07] Morri89: it’s based on where the person subbing with prime is based on right?
[0:31:18] BakinPacman: it does make sense LUL

[0:33:08] StreamElements: The new merch is here PogChamp Check it out: https://merch.streamelements.com/uhsnow
[0:33:10] vipslampy15: @b8nd1t but also terrible timing as he called him king LUL
[0:33:18] Chrissy1337: depends on your twitch usage Fade37
[0:33:19] B8ND1T: 👍
[0:33:31] Ruvebo: 11 or 12 i think
[0:33:34] Lammynatos: What does turbo do?
[0:33:41] Lepaca: turbo is worth every penny
[0:33:41] Machatie: 12eu in Netherlands
[0:33:41] Ruvebo: @Lammynatos no Ads
[0:33:41] StreamElements: Ads support this stream massively, sorry if ads popped up at the wrong moment. But you could always subscribe or get Twitch Turbo to avoid getting ads!
[0:33:43] Chrissy1337: no ads on twitch Lammynatos
[0:33:43] 00Elite: turbo is very much not overpriced if you watch a couple people
[0:33:46] vipslampy15: 4 subs and turbo is 55 bucks here
[0:33:47] Fade37: £11.99 for the UK
[0:33:50] BakinPacman: its fair with inflation i think but kinda hurts seeing it go up
[0:33:53] Lil_Miss1: That's not a bad price tbf
[0:33:58] Lammynatos: Cool
[0:33:59] Nahku: if I didn't have turbo, I honestly wouldn't watch twitch hardly at all, the ads are out of control
[0:34:00] BluGiant: 12  uk yup
[0:34:00] Terr0rBytes: So prime subs in the UK being a flat $1.8 means in essence the split is kind of reversed 30/70?
[0:34:02] Halik_TG: Turbo is great, I watch about 5 - 10 people so I save money each month
[0:34:03] gimpling_: Turbo is awesome as long as you watch alot of twitch
[0:34:19] vipslampy15: Yup
[0:34:21] timps00: 11.99€ in Italy
[0:34:27] jamie_doogle95: tureeeee
[0:34:56] almost_a_curtain: Really like turbo!
[0:35:04] kcRocco: yeah i watch a lot of streams so turbo is good for me personlly
[0:35:04] amit1607: some of the countries like mine dont even have twitch prime
[0:35:06] BakinPacman: KEKW
[0:35:10] Fade37: As a streamer do you earn anything out of Turbo?
[0:35:13] gimpling_: I watch here, Bobo, vader, spaceboy and various others, saves me alot and streamers get revenue still
[0:35:21] iDefault1337: i finally applied for WL sitt
[0:35:31] ben0809: @iDefault1337 PoG
[0:35:38] ben0809: HELL YE TOM Pog
[0:35:41] SorrySamIAm: my ADD is too bad to not have turbo
[0:35:43] Fade37: Ahhh, I had assumed that didn't work like that, thanks
[0:35:47] EmrysorMerlin: Aye I found it great as I can switch streamers to see different pov without getting ads when I join and I then sub to people for the person and not just to avoid ads
[0:35:47] BakinPacman: they give you the revenue you would gain by someone seeing the ad right?
[0:35:47] StreamElements: Ads support this stream massively, sorry if ads popped up at the wrong moment. But you could always subscribe or get Twitch Turbo to avoid getting ads!
[0:35:53] Lammynatos: So turbo does actually help streamers to some degree?
[0:36:00] Darthremar: you probably get more from turbo then you would from that viewer actually seeing the ads
[0:36:02] Chrissy1337: yeah BakinPacman pretty much
[0:36:02] gimpling_: Turbo viewers dont see ads, but streamer gets paid for the ads a turbo viewer would have seen
[0:36:07] iDefault1337: lowkey wanna try and get hired for cop on WL nodd
[0:36:21] Lammynatos: Ok that's better than I thought.
[0:36:29] EmrysorMerlin: @idefault1337 good luck
[0:36:51] BakinPacman: the only reason i have prime still is the occasional gift things they do like the league stuff they had
[0:36:51] Chrissy1337: tbh this prime change was bound to happen
[0:36:55] CmdrPain: Its great for RP streams
[0:37:02] amit1607: best thing about twitch is they have banner ads for mobile that than annoying unskippable ads
[0:37:02] StreamElements: Ads support this stream massively, sorry if ads popped up at the wrong moment. But you could always subscribe or get Twitch Turbo to avoid getting ads!
[0:37:12] dr_halsey_: should get a cut if someone is watching ur stream and clicks on the "get turbo" button LUL

[0:38:03] jaydosjau: KEKW
[0:38:04] ben0809: fricc ads
[0:38:05] StreamElements: Ads support this stream massively, sorry if ads popped up at the wrong moment. But you could always subscribe or get Twitch Turbo to avoid getting ads!
[0:38:08] SaintjimmyTV: the amount turbo costs vs how much they pay out per ad per person must be quite the mark up
