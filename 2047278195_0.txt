[0:57:54] iwr1techky12: Doctors got buffed to 750 an hour but that is still ass
[0:57:58] Aesp9: They shouldn‚Äôt just keep buffing jobs though. It‚Äôs more about nerfing the over performers so server inflation doesn‚Äôt go crazy

[1:01:32] waterhigh: 8 gears? is it a truck? lmao
[1:01:37] iLLuSi0NN: Lando Norris gotta come to nopixel when they add wheel support and race you LUL
[1:01:42] clutchjeans_: @ra_vincy you can change everything even interior
[1:02:04] magunbp: @ra_vincy doesn't have the money
[1:02:05] JohnnyMack__: @waterhigh I mean IRL the mk5 supra has an 8 speed
[1:02:14] clutchjeans_: idk how much the tuner shop can do at the moment, but it will all be added later

[1:03:03] JohnnyMack__: I believe you
[1:03:20] iwr1techky12: Probably just latency issues
[1:03:26] ra_vincy: is gear shifting diff on keyboard vs controller ?
[1:03:44] v2gaming2: @cyderverse i know what sequantial so it neither manual or auto
[1:03:45] DavidGreenz: there might be some sort of latency between gears
[1:04:00] N4CHOS4VIOR: yea probably latency and potentially issues due to server tic rate, could be prioritizing animations
[1:04:02] CYDERVERSE: @v2gaming2 Idk shit about cars so shrujj
[1:04:18] Leumas__s: you and me cy frenn
[1:04:23] kebbi: no gas for you

[1:04:30] v2gaming2: Maybe you can't downshift fast
[1:04:38] iLLuSi0NN: Maybe you need better clutch?
[1:04:48] v2gaming2: Or trans
[1:04:58] Regis025: does holding it work

[1:05:39] N4CHOS4VIOR: is ur controller wired to pc right now?
[1:05:44] bjj_dev: Hud only gets updates every x amount of times a second so it can miss gears
