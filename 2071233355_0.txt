[0:50:09] moo_of_doom: Heard it called wish guardians of the galaxy LUL
[0:50:09] dazzaisreal: it looks so... wrong
[0:50:10] thewelshperson: It just looks a bit awkward
[0:50:12] IrishSausage: Tiny Tina not unhinged enough

[0:50:16] Juiced_Warlord: I saw JB as claptrap and that's all I care about

[0:50:55] Ushosk_: games turning into Movies is a wierd era but we are there so im not suprised
[0:50:56] Fluffy_Violin: How did they get so many known actors for all the wrong roles man
[0:50:57] Linarino: It's weird
[0:50:58] Kohtalon_: it just becomes every other generic hollywood buddy comedy to tell tickets on famous names
[0:51:00] Karnage_de: Kind of have to watch it now

[0:51:08] SiegeOblivion: I like how Jammie Lee Curtis is anti guns and she's in borderlands LUL
[0:51:09] Cephyric: Kohtalon_ I'm pretty sure there was some shit that wet down with Claptrap's VA over the last game and them not paying him or something, so probably would've hard skipped this
[0:51:10] bfdliam91: played the game your know story
[0:51:13] Red_Concierge_Of_Crime: If kevin hart and Kevin black wasn't it? I would like it more. I can never take them seriously when it comes to acting. Kappa LUL
[0:51:18] Brandonhipster: So cate character is what like 20's maybe 30's and she 50 so why? And roland is serious character so all i see is kevin hard being kevin hard
[0:51:24] dazzaisreal: SMH
[0:51:28] kingdomFX: and i'll watch it because its already better than suicide squad yesh

[0:51:37] Safe_Tea_Thirst: waiiiiiit Kevin Hart is meant to be Roland AINTNOWAY took me that long to realise
[0:51:38] Kohtalon_: @Cephyric yeah doesn't have to be the VA, but keep his voice style

[0:52:39] BraddersJ93: She's young Gamora too @Ericj20
[0:52:41] NzlSean: isnt lilith supposed to me like late 20s? not 60
[0:52:47] Ericj20: @BraddersJ93 Yup
[0:52:48] Roadjogger: Never played the game so it looks like standard action movie to me.
[0:52:48] jummper__: it might have worked as a anime
[0:52:51] Cephyric: Zaaroc I need to start watching that. I already had low expectations after I heard about all the weird changes they had said they've done
[0:52:55] pointless197: last of us got good reviews and mario made money

[5:10:05] ZombieNinja74: the writing is on the wall
[5:10:06] aramaic_992: did you just run over a 3ft long slug?
[5:10:15] Cephyric: Made sure to separate herself from the decision pepeSus
[5:10:15] Kyllah: Can we make a pool, how menny in chat thinks shes getting fired
[5:10:18] Sylar996: good luck on your endeavors o7
[5:10:27] rathan_reddy: Prayge archery shows up
[5:10:37] benb92: all rays fault
[5:10:42] magic_freak: @justinfrstnbrg82 OOC we know all that. But Candice don't
[5:10:43] RGeneral24: yeah OMEGADANCEBUTFAST
[5:10:44] aramaic_992: oh,  the cat's up
[5:10:47] JohnJKnapp: walker is a good shout
[5:10:47] lavachickens: 'it was nice working with you candice, youre fired'
[5:10:54] Grinikth: @rathan_reddy suss why 🏛
[5:10:59] TheSauceShaman: if archery makes it your chances improve dramatically
[5:11:01] JohnJKnapp: Walker can at least help you gather your thoughts
[5:11:02] Safe_Tea_Thirst: why did she take the phone?
[5:11:06] rathan_reddy: grin awkward different archery
[5:11:07] PartTimeNinja_: walker on a big investigation at 24 hours deep like pepeW
[5:11:07] Dan_S__: just look at the gp... nevermind PoroSad
[5:11:07] ikeriker357: dont let them fire Candice, pwease
[5:11:13] Grinikth: @rathan_reddy oh OMEGALUL
[5:11:14] DaylightDegen: Pink whip 💗  ridin dirty in the pink mobile
[5:11:14] Zoeper: lula could save us
[5:11:16] Yuna08: Ray and Louis where the only one who were searching for Candice let's not forget that chat OMEGALUL
[5:11:20] benb92: grab a beer and watch
[5:11:21] Cephyric: justinfrstnbrg82 We know exactly what it's about OOC, we've been following the meta since they started talking about it LUL
[5:11:38] Dan_S__: harold said advocate which is quite different hmjj
[5:11:40] madboyfreddy: its pretty much bring someone in for tea OMEGADANCEBUTFAST
[5:11:46] PartTimeNinja_: the way harold asked that made it sound like they could help you, he probably doesnt know they cant OMEGADANCEBUTFAST
[5:11:48] sentient_pancakes: they didn't even get the date correct on the letter OMEGADANCEBUTFAST
[5:11:49] JohnJKnapp: you can consult with them on the side but you have to do the talking
[5:11:49] vortexTMG: they are the emotional support statue peepoGiggle
[5:11:50] Kroykumzz: bring the cop that will take you home after you get fired OMEGADANCEBUTFAST
[5:11:50] magic_freak: You can talk with them but they can't speak for you
[5:11:55] greenmoose: yeah not sure why they're an advocate when they're not allowed to advocate LUL
[5:11:55] Kohtalon_: witness for future civil trial YesYes
[5:11:57] Yuna08: Archery is the best pick
[5:11:59] kingdomFX: can they be used for a "sidebar"
[5:11:59] darnuall2heck: If Candice gets mayor, they will wish they were on your side.
[5:12:03] Artstealer12: I lov you can bring in another officer so they can stand there and watch you get yelled at.
[5:12:10] StreamElements: Check out Sennheiser at http://www.sennheiser.com/ !!
[5:12:11] Englandjessss7: Archery would be able to see Candice's growth too if she was fired and decided to go back etc
[5:12:22] Kohtalon_: if archery can't be there she should still get someone, maybe nova at this point
[5:12:23] Shaws: i hope that they let you say what u need to say NODDERS
[5:12:26] RGeneral24: Also Archery can see the PD failed Candice AGAIN
[5:12:27] Cephyric: Harold did say Officer Advocate, who under gerrity or whatever is entitled to speak with and on Candice's behalf
[5:12:40] OvrGwn: Normally to make sure things are fair so if it goes further you have a witness
[5:12:41] SkyLineRaider: Having someone respected "on your side" might prevent them from being unreasonable?
[5:12:45] RGeneral24: yes
[5:12:51] Zoeper: how could you, it got handed to you
[5:12:59] ikeriker357: bring Pred lol
[5:13:00] Andi489156: so leave it with the crim ?
[5:13:02] Agathon_nl: yep
[5:13:08] magic_freak: I thought it was the unlocking that was the problem?
[5:13:09] Agathon_nl: 60 days to press charges
[5:13:13] Whiry: people hand stolen property to cops all the time
[5:13:14] Englandjessss7: plus there was no report at the time too right
[5:13:15] EBK_StickEm: but you were off duty
[5:13:16] RGeneral24: yeah Ray should have been arrested by Wilcox and Peach
[5:13:16] rondee_: yeah, the phone is evidence
[5:13:17] Dan_S__: you were off duty and also 60 days yep
[5:13:22] eadwineii: You should have handed off straight away, not unlocked it as you were compromised in the case
[5:13:23] Kohtalon_: everyone else was too scared to touch it, even sgts, apparently 'skip' is the correct procedure
[5:13:23] wossi_01: How do you know whose it is without unlocking it hmjj
[5:13:25] londonwalker_: you were not a cop
[5:13:27] JohnJKnapp: Candice didn’t steal the phone so there’s that
[5:13:32] Ada_Dee: expected to arrest the only person who tried to help as an off duty officer and victim? dojaW
[5:13:35] RGeneral24: YEP
[5:13:39] magic_freak: I mean you were a victim and not a cop at the time
[5:13:41] Dan_S__: peach was WITH THEM sorry??
[5:13:45] Dan_S__: or am i misunderstand
[5:13:46] RGeneral24: @Dan_S__ yes OMEGADANCEBUTFAST
[5:13:46] PartTimeNinja_: peach, and then baker when she took the report
[5:13:49] Kohtalon_: wilcox is literally CID isn't he? why couldn't he investigate
[5:13:52] Yuna08: @Ada_Dee Right dojaW
[5:13:52] Dan_S__: AT THE SHOOTING?
[5:13:54] rondee_: she was, took their statement
[5:13:56] Cephyric: I don't think being a victim of a crime strictly prevents a cop from helping investigate said crime, that's like a super cliche classic cop TV show story
[5:13:59] ShooShoe: Would officer discretion apply with arresting ray?
[5:14:04] magic_freak: I wonder I they realised you weren't on duty?
[5:14:10] StreamElements: Check out my new highlights channel! https://www.youtube.com/@wolfabellehighlights
[5:14:18] ducksplosionman: Holy tabs, batman!
[5:15:16] bloominghel: You asked faraday first thing next morning what to do and then followed her advice
[5:15:28] benkidd: they should take into account Candice having been just kidnapped and traumatised, but no one seems to care about that part
[5:15:34] Dan_S__: it was 15th/16th
[5:15:39] rondee_: should i tell how to find it?
[5:15:45] happydaze86: i assumed it was starting to process the phone by unlocking it that was the problem
[5:15:56] magic_freak: 16th according to the letter
[5:16:12] BorophylI: HmmNotes
[5:16:16] Cephyric: benkidd I mean they should be taking into account that command themselves needed to figure out between themselves what you can do with a burner phone, so why would a regular deputy know
[5:16:16] rathan_reddy: catBruh how was candice a witness
[5:16:46] TheSauceShaman: do they think you were there?
[5:16:52] vortexTMG: Candice is a witness of the shootout Smile
[5:16:53] MiskyeXD: even another phone
[5:17:03] deffdog: jeez got enough tabs open?
[5:17:22] RGeneral24: YEP
[5:17:36] BorophylI: NODDERS
[5:17:37] Dan_S__: also, why would it be your job in any case to press charges on ANYONE candice was a victim
[5:17:46] Shaws: you either gonna cook them or they gonna destroy your speech ReeferSad
[5:17:58] augu85: "what would be protocol"
[5:18:05] ZombieNinja74: i think candice will be ok.  i think every one knows she's truthful almost to a fault.
[5:18:08] xwarnpeacex: fired??
[5:18:21] Cephyric: I hope they say exactly what she did OMEGADANCEBUTFAST
[5:18:24] TruthHurtsSom3T1mes: They are gonna say, not take it, as receipt of stolen property is a crime.
[5:18:28] PartTimeNinja_: hopefully they will let you tell the story from your end, not just ask questions
[5:18:32] Zoeper: new candice rule inc
[5:18:34] eadwineii: Blame Terry
[5:18:34] Kohtalon_: if they "tell ray to give it to baker" but that assumes ray would trust baker
[5:18:37] stop_thinking: yeah they will say all the give it to another cop ect
[5:18:38] wooligar: baker ReallyMad
[5:19:02] Dan_S__: that doesnt fly
[5:19:04] Shaws: WideHardo ray should be in trouble not u
[5:19:14] Cephyric: How would Candice have known it was evidence of a crime when Ray said she found it monkaHmm
[5:19:23] Englandjessss7: I mean Ray should have been arrested by peach anyways so Candice wouldnt have even had to be given it
[5:19:30] Pseudo_Panda: Just got here but I'
[5:19:34] rondee_: take it and charge ray, i think its the right
[5:19:40] Pseudo_Panda: I'm already obsessed with Belle's sleeves
[5:19:45] Kohtalon_: that report is so badly written, cause it wasn't even ray who followed the marabuntas, MB chased after them when they kidnapped one of them
[5:20:04] Dan_S__: take it, speak to command/another officer and put it in evidence - and guess what.. thats what candice did OMEGADANCEBUTFAST
[5:20:06] magic_freak: The only thing with suspected stolen property is that it can't be used as evidence. The unlocking may be more problematic but u didn't know
[5:20:15] roastplus: CatTrippin what a mess
[5:20:28] Shaws: i hope that they dont interrupt you too much Madge
[5:20:29] ducksplosionman: just gotta let it play out
[5:20:43] Yuna08: You can't really do much with it tbh
[5:20:44] totonred: Candices miatakes dont warrant a firing. But PD have spun it so badly
[5:20:47] BorophylI: yeah they keep saying "malicious prosecution" when nobody is getting any bloody charges, nobody is prosecuting anything
[5:20:48] rondee_: it can be used as evidence of the stealing, but not the kidnnaping
[5:20:57] thantoscat: If I were them I'd be scared of the farting curse for 30days if they fire Candice wolfaGiggle
[5:20:58] Safe_Tea_Thirst: not being used as evidence because there's zero fucking interest in going after the kidnappers OMEGADANCEBUTFAST
[5:20:58] Englandjessss7: I can already see Lou responding as if its obvious but Candice has barely been trained for anything lmao
[5:21:05] Dan_S__: DankG this shit is good
[5:21:06] Kroykumzz: yeah
[5:21:08] rathan_reddy: used brain WHAT shit cop
[5:21:11] PartTimeNinja_: if it was it should have been baker seizing it
[5:21:15] PartTimeNinja_: straight away
[5:21:37] justinfrstnbrg82: I
[5:21:37] Englandjessss7: plus with baker just saying "a few days"
[5:21:42] Samscraft: I mean they think you had the phone for days, when it was barely 1 full day
[5:21:45] Kohtalon_: the time frame is messed up anyway cause the kidnapping report was the day after the shooting report
[5:21:46] RGeneral24: yeah it falls on Baker to say "we can use the phone" but then she goes "place it if you want" and reports to command LULW
[5:21:52] Cephyric: Command didn't even know if they needed a subpoena to unlock a burner phone until like 2 days after the fact anyway. How would anyone below them know the answer for sure in order for the narrative of corruption to be valid?
[5:22:11] justinfrstnbrg82: I'm confused are we talking about your phone or the phone you found
[5:22:20] Safe_Tea_Thirst: there's literally no attempts at all going after the kidnappers despite hearing its MG, no hospital checks for gunshot victims etc SMH
[5:22:25] Dan_S__: slow rolling pd OMEGADANCEBUTFAST
[5:22:28] BorophylI: peepoPog
[5:22:31] BorophylI: OMEGALUL
[5:22:34] TruthHurtsSom3T1mes: @cephyric command knew, just not the command Candice talked to.
[5:22:46] magic_freak: @englandjessss7 yeah, realistically she shouldn't have been promoted and it's those that did that and 'trained' hers fault. For me demotion back to cadet is the only solution/punishment
[5:22:56] jummper__: wisague Gladge

[5:36:36] NYYXX10: meow
[5:36:42] chaospiper322: @Shaws i watched since 24 slots in 1.0 OMEGALUL

[5:36:54] magic_freak: @cephyric nah, I've always felt cars and houses don't block off sound in a realistic way in game. It's good for gameplay but not realistic
[5:36:58] Ada_Dee: wolfaSit
[5:37:00] justinfrstnbrg82: So is Candice suspended for the phone she found or for her phone that was stolen
[5:37:22] m0stlywater: @justinfrstnbrg82 maybe a bit of both???
[5:37:31] rondee_: the all situation actually
[5:37:55] magic_freak: @justinfrstnbrg82 found. Noone is accusing her of anything with her phone. Why would they?
[5:37:57] justinfrstnbrg82: OK
[5:38:11] Shaws: chaospiper322 i remember 24 slots idk how long i've been watching lost count
[5:38:17] Cephyric: magic_freak They clearly have the tech already to be able to isolate sound coming from behind a specific area though, so isolating sound via car doors is in theory possible. They could toggle it based on windows being up/down too
[5:38:23] chocolateeee32: wolfaLL
[5:39:06] magic_freak: The problem is also she didn't find it. She got it from Ray being told it was stolen. Now I don't see that as a problem but it seems some do.
[5:39:07] Cephyric: That isolator being a movable object might be the challenging part

[5:40:44] Laurenzo_ZA: go find mommy yes
[5:40:45] Cephyric: magic_freak tbh I don't even think it's that, it's that it was a personal phone and she accessed it without a subpoena. I have a feeling they'll be ignoring the part where everyone thought it was a burner and haf of command thought you could just access a burner at any time
[5:40:47] xNiki: but i like ass

[6:48:33] TruthHurtsSom3T1mes: @cephyric guess we'll see at the meeting.
[6:48:37] Cephyric: That's probably a bit on the nose of a discussion we should have in meta chat rather than here though, so I'll leave it there
