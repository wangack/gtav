[3:54:46] graua: he only said davis
[3:54:51] jovansjj: Lol no. He just said Davis.
[3:54:52] carcool12: he said both
[3:54:56] Soraffe: @carcool12 Yes but that's not enough to convict, hence why he needed his ID to prove it

[3:58:30] Soraffe: Yep
[3:58:45] Soraffe: He's been adding to it for a week now which i feel like shouldn't be a thing.
[3:59:05] Soraffe: There should be a time limit for filling out warrants
[3:59:23] carcool12: @Soraffe nah I think you should be able to cause its no longer the original warrant its a court case
[3:59:59] Soraffe: @carcool12 The original Warrant was supposed to be dropped by High Command. High Command failed to do it, thus this warrant is the SAME warrant
[4:00:31] carcool12: @Soraffe I know, but now its going to court both sides need to build a case I agree it should have been dropped
[4:00:50] Soraffe: but he shouldn't have time to fix it a week later
[4:01:18] carcool12: its not the same warrant any more tho

[4:02:21] ViceroyStark: jonbHmm
[4:02:21] Soraffe: when did he confirm based on MDW?
[4:03:00] AntleredCormorant: @Soraffe when someone called him on his BS :D
[4:03:15] carcool12: @Soraffe post-chase
[4:03:17] mobius1989: sentryNotes
[4:03:26] carcool12: which can be a point in court
[4:03:26] TRAYW1N: its a weird conversation. meta stuff but through character. Its interesting
[4:03:49] dirty_dog1969: Heli taxi great idea
[4:03:51] lockedheart7: adding so much to the warrant after the fact seems pretty flimsy, especially if it's all based on an initial, single thing that simply can't be proven
[4:04:17] Soraffe: @lockedheart7 Yeah it's shady imo.
[4:04:33] Soraffe: It shouldn't be a thing unless new evidence appears like another witness
[4:05:00] graua: what bums me the most about this case is that sentry only tried to test out the trunk mechanic ONCE at immediately gets caught sentryWhy
[4:05:09] graua: *and
[4:05:10] Homless_Stone: Should've gone for the bench trial
[4:05:10] K0D3R_: @Soraffe After Sentry shook them it looks like going through his VOD
[4:05:10] SACancel: I mean..expert witness doesn't mean much with these cops
[4:05:13] sterowentUS: i don't like the warrant methods. these warrants are put out with very little to back them, and it suspends all sorts of actions
[4:05:13] Soraffe: Yeah this shouldn't be allowed AT all, it's almost Powergamey to me so the cops can win a court case.
[4:05:18] SACancel: to be fair
[4:05:33] lockedheart7: But if you can't prove the ONE thing all of it was derived from then it all falls apart, like taking out the bottom of a house of cards
[4:05:56] Meatyfrog: @lockedheart7 the problem is cops can lie
[4:06:06] tokinsmurf: jesus ziggy...
[4:06:07] EarlGreyIII: If your Lawyer was smart he took a screenshot of the original warrant
[4:06:09] tokinsmurf: scared me lol

[4:06:16] ViceroyStark: J
[4:06:18] jovansjj: Same lol
[4:06:24] theglizzykisser: the guy in the back keeps dying LUL
[4:06:33] lockedheart7: True they can lie but like Soraffe said, this feels almost powergamey
[4:06:34] jovansjj: sentryGrizz
[4:07:24] Soraffe: @lockedheart7 It really does feel powergamey, I'm not one to call this stuff out or anything but I've NEVER seen someone add stuff a week later unless photo evidence was there etc
[4:07:25] DadlyShadow: pentawJ
[4:07:45] jovansjj: Syphilitic dick sentryLOL sentryLOL sentryLOL
[4:08:05] carcool12: Since we have the original warrant, this new warrant is being treated as just that, a new warrant. They're building a case now just how Davis is building a case now
[4:08:07] gameswithpa: isn’t a warrant just given to pick someone up then you build the case?
[4:08:30] DadlyShadow: as far as i know they have up to 48hours before court for evidence collection
[4:08:30] Soraffe: @carcool12 The OG warrant is still there, the cop is adding content to the OG warrant
[4:08:35] sterowentUS: that is not the case
[4:08:44] DB991: @Soraffe Maybe the Lawyer can point that out and just make the cops look bad. They added things a week later after the the initial.
[4:08:44] carcool12: I think one of the largest arguement is gonna be the time between Davis Identifying himself and the MDW confirmation
[4:08:47] Jertzukka: @Soraffe Nothing powergamey at all, this is all RP. You don't need all your evidence in a warrant, just the PC for the arrest. If someone contests it in bench of course you add all you had.
[4:08:59] sterowentUS: the highway patrol is actively avoiding 'the best of the best' image
[4:09:00] carcool12: @Soraffe lawyer has original warrant
[4:09:50] carcool12: warrants are where you gather evidence as police, maybe they should make it a rule to open a new one if it goes to trial, but its THE way for police to organize their case
[4:10:07] DadlyShadow: i dont think a phonto would stand up, could be triplets, a fingerprint is solid
[4:10:10] gameswithpa: @jertzukka that’s what I was thinking

[4:23:22] Jertzukka: The thing is, if you drive carefully they can't hit you with reckless driving which is a felony, you'd only catch citations for 125$ pop

[4:24:12] Soraffe: @WhskyTangoFxtrot Yes
[4:24:14] sterowentUS: get a competent lawyer and challenge it in court
[4:24:15] MrMulletMan: it’s dumb that third row seating doesn’t work. I mean it’s in the car
[4:24:18] J_Wedge: Still, the option is there should it be needed down the road
[4:24:21] rummsdiebumms: @gvwolf right?  ;)
[4:24:25] Syrkle13: garbage men hang off the side...
[4:24:31] mobius1989: true
[4:24:38] carcool12: @Syrkle13 on residential streets
[4:24:51] EchosAxe: riding in a truck bed used to be fun
[4:24:52] GreenOrcGaming: rp that the people hanging are actually inside the car
[4:25:03] Soraffe: But how many people IRL do you see hanging outside their Expedition?
[4:25:16] Soraffe: they probably just based it on IRL stuff
[4:25:16] chadwurd: Should only be reckless over a certain speed
[4:25:20] Quesitron: I feel like it should be an exception since your car can visibly fit more than the mechanics allow
[4:25:21] MrAyeAxe: yeah at least let it go horribly wrong a few times before legislating it LUL
[4:25:31] carcool12: it's 100% based on IRL laws
[4:25:45] gvwolf: interesting you cant hang off the side but they'll allow people to "carry" inside the vehicle
[4:25:45] Jertzukka: You should do it and force people to sign waivers to lose their right to safety
[4:25:51] RAWSTYLE: monkaS
[4:25:58] theglizzykisser: i feel like it should be fine in the city. maybe not allowing it on the highway seems fair
[4:25:59] MsApplebee: Maybe the DA can get you a special permit, since your her driver.  TPFufun
[4:26:00] SACancel: advertise 8, suggest 4
[4:26:00] Mattigins: Talk to a judge about it?
[4:26:18] GreenOrcGaming: Maybe ask the Mayor for permission?
[4:26:28] Soraffe: Yeah if you can /carry someone and sit in a vehicle which means that the carried person isn't seatbelted thus would constitute the same as reckless as hanging off the side.
[4:26:28] carcool12: waivers would get rid of reckless endangerment and outside city limits works
[4:27:01] forgotscholar: The homies on my lap
[4:27:02] ViceroyStark: Maybe the law can be changed to say a certified taxi is exempt idk. Server seems more open to conversations like that
[4:27:07] dreamsofbunnies: True
[4:27:12] ChristopherKupp: does anybody have a clip of the incident?
[4:27:24] ChristopherKupp: and by anybody I mean Andy LUL
[4:27:30] carcool12: the /carry I feel like is roleplaying the 5th seat in most vehicles since in-game there is no middle seat in vics
