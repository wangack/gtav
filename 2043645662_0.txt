His roomates have had enough, as you can see the garbage has pilled up to the roof. No matter how many times his roomates try to get him help, he raises his voice and has a tantrum. We have brought over with us the local sheriff as he has threatened to burn the place down with space heaters with his roomates inside.

[1:17:45] KcsBack: imagine that
[1:17:48] HueyO: lang needs to make the room seperate so it only loads when you go into the room

[1:18:16] Wordbeast: @Lanthin he did already
[1:18:17] KrisCat: @dsaurous it was doing this before the pallets were there
[1:18:21] dsaurous: it’s invisible right now buddha had it when he was placing furniture on the main floor
[1:18:27] yceja11: devs had to literally clean the house cuz it was causing headaches lmao
[1:18:33] BaldScooter: there wasn’t 500 pallets. there was like 35-40 lol
[1:18:38] Popovzky: yeah thats why rooms are important
[1:18:39] Lanthin: @wordbeast it's loading the whole house
[1:18:40] SkyHawk0404: The room system has to be setup
[1:18:41] ProngsAedan: yupp
[1:18:42] lightstormclaw: he still needs to section off rooms to fix the issue also
[1:18:43] perox89: yeah the rooms are not setup also to help loading
[1:18:58] yceja11: you also have to make rooms so it would load in chunks and not the whole thing at a time
[1:19:00] oldmangrumpa: Yes
[1:19:01] drukkz: it should
[1:19:02] Hogie48: yes
[1:19:02] SkyHawk0404: It would help

[1:19:13] Seronjo: so it helps
[1:19:14] oldmangrumpa: you need to add the items in the list under the folder for the room @Harry
[1:19:15] Thunamin: Room for each area
[1:19:15] BlueShift_IV: do one for every room maybe?
[1:19:18] Tyriese: It may just move the lag to the threshold, hopefully not
[1:19:20] MONK_43: need to make at least 3 rooms to work
[1:19:21] TastyKudzu: No. You have to manually add all the items downstairs into the "room" after making it.
[1:19:22] SkyHawk0404: It will only load that room when people are close to it
[1:19:24] Hogie48: but you need to put the objects that are in that physical space, in to the room
[1:19:24] Lanthin: You have to place all items under that folder too
[1:19:25] drukkz: yes
[1:19:25] zazmania: its not that easy anymore, you need to put all of the items into a folder for the room also

[3:10:49] CourageTheCowardIy: the dryer is working faster then 3 washers
[3:10:58] TastyKudzu: The optimal growing setup seems to be getting multiple growers not on the app where harry can set down the plants and dip. They manage the fertilizer, water, anti-pest, etc and then harvest it. Harry only has to literally put the plants down then dip. Leaving as many slots as possible for pushers.

[3:12:53] i4mchef: Hello chat just got home from work. How is everyone?
[3:13:14] TastyKudzu: Medium racks are still weird imo. They hold 1.66x the amount of small racks but take up way more space. Like being cheaper is nice but from a space standpoint they're worse.

[7:22:20] ProngsAedan: yeah, always usefull for the runners who are getting their stars up/ vetted
[7:22:52] TastyKudzu: So for small racks it turns out that effectively each rack gives 1 brick (100 bags) a day since they hold 3 each but take 3 days to dry. Big racks give ~166 bags per day. Assuming you're maxing out your drying potential.
