[3:15:33] jay_skyline_r34: You know some one irl pulling his goalie in there xD
[3:15:38] Cinalipples: People are just getting the ability to run a bar
[3:15:39] Grafhicks: hit up moon, you guys can paint the town
[3:15:42] DadBodNation: isn’t the tequilala a bar?
[3:15:55] ViceroyStark: The split def sucks but it is what it is
[3:16:06] Kiddersteve: Where the hell is everybody
[3:16:09] itisTeddy: After Roach left they kinda killed the rp in sandy
[3:16:09] Grafhicks: get a room at the roach motel SeemsGood
[3:16:13] ViceroyStark: I do think onx will have a long life though
[3:16:34] sometimeduck: Lack of bars been a complaint of a few rpers yeah, some been trying to open up a few
[3:16:34] crabhowse: Agree
[3:16:41] Cinalipples: You burned Tequila before you got in the door, lol
[3:16:42] SporkPixie: When Finley, Dom and Roach left Sandy, the RP there died off
[3:16:48] Grafhicks: roach left?
[3:17:00] MironixTV: roach is roach
[3:17:07] Gwnquinten: well Onx is making everything themself, so its understandable everything is slow
[3:17:12] flanellograf: I think the slowburn for crime mechanics drove some people away, there wasn't much to do
[3:17:13] SporkPixie: Not the server
[3:17:30] graua: there was a dude yesterday you gave your number to but didnt get his
[3:17:35] carcool12: my money’s on todd
[3:17:52] Grafhicks: todds a toad
[3:17:54] zmillz3: I only know nopixel, how long has ONX been poppin?
[3:18:00] itisTeddy: Penta has said several times we need more shitlords here
[3:18:08] Grafhicks: 2 months
[3:18:11] MironixTV: hey /me rp is super fun
[3:18:16] Kiddersteve: lot of people seem to be stuck thinking about mechanics
[3:18:22] bozyness420: use your imagination to create crime remember the soe days make something outta nothing
[3:18:25] whens__lunch: SOE Gladge
[3:18:26] SporkPixie: @zmillz3  since right before NP went 4.0
[3:18:27] itisTeddy: @zmillz3 only 2.5 months
[3:18:45] LAriot: like red dead right?
[3:18:53] ViceroyStark: Some crazy shit will happen with nopixel like it always does, wether it's cops being hated or crims bored/malding. Onx feels like less weight on the shoulders
[3:18:55] Ruinkind: These servers evolved, people play this like a second life MMO, mechanics keep them busy.  @Kiddersteve
[3:18:57] whens__lunch: that was when literally everything was scuffed too
[3:19:01] Ruinkind: I don'
[3:19:03] sometimeduck: Extort businesses if someone was that deviously inclined i guess
[3:19:03] MironixTV: one is sure: there's Adam on this server
[3:19:09] zmillz3: Oh okay. That makes sense. Thanks!
[3:19:24] Kiddersteve: @Ruinkind I would hope RP would keep them busy
[3:19:33] chaosandlead: i mean ... i enjoy watching it even if you think its boring
[3:19:38] bozyness420: mechanics are for people with no imagination imo
[3:19:39] chaosandlead: i think its okay
[3:19:47] neoamos: What does your character want?
[3:20:03] Ruinkind: In a idealistic world, sure.  @Kiddersteve
[3:20:14] subsistcyber: If more people roleplayed off of what their character would do rather than where the mechanics are, RP would feel more organic.
[3:20:20] bagool1: think a lot of ppl are just spread out
[3:20:28] CENSOR_FREE_THOUGHT: just got back, have we found many humans yet
[3:20:28] flanellograf: ^
[3:20:37] Robkeebler: i bet people are grinding garbage...T_T
[3:20:41] Ruinkind: If RP servers keep chasing the NP wave, you'll be monetizing the wrong people regardless.
[3:20:53] MironixTV: i love the music crew on this server - they make a lot of dedicated to this server songs
[3:20:55] syphalisdude: People had started businesses etc but alot got kicked out for squatting and not applying through for them, makes it seem a bit more dead than it was.
[3:20:57] Kiddersteve: Isn't the server like 350 slots right now ?
[3:20:57] flanellograf: but it is slow today
[3:20:59] bozyness420: soe was hands down the best rp I’ve seen an familyrp in its early days was also great
[3:21:00] Daak_Cloud: The first rp I watched was Proxy doing her EMS character…..Abdul and Macapone …..little Squirt around there somewhere too exbcQw
[3:21:02] MironixTV: poet with his ACAW
[3:21:09] MironixTV: and pub
[3:21:15] Grafhicks: weird shit tho last week pol were told to stop squatting at businesses, when prior to that they were told to “fake it til they make it”
[3:21:21] bagool1: ye the server is 350 slots i believe
[3:21:26] Robkeebler: abdul with his taxi, goot times
