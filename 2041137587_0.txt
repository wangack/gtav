[1:11:23] RapidIQ: Buying the rack allowed you to mine more btc pr day, earlier than everyone else
[1:11:26] yoseven_teen_38: nah for the time they bought it, it def wasn't a scam, no one else had it
[1:11:31] quote_me_if_horsen: 25k is bad if the group dont make that cash in 1 day

[1:16:40] dyll3: Hmm ok AK vagos Hmm
[1:16:50] Mr_Nee: 5k now p/butc maybe, as supply is increasing exponentially, not previously imo. Will be interesting to see how the market plays out

[1:21:25] Heiridum: to be honest, it sounds like they would charge them say 10k to let him set up their turf
[1:21:31] Mr_Nee: No worries, much love
[1:22:06] ViolenceOfDucks: at least the house is free of car parts

[1:23:49] AloofMango: yeah exactly
[1:24:17] Mr_Nee: You're valuing BUTC at 0 though in your 300% calculation
[1:24:38] reagon_plays: how much is a rack going right now ?
[1:24:44] KentKLS: Mr_Nee the rack was empty tho, not butcoin there
[1:24:45] UnluckyPhil: drainGang cuz all the money goes in da sink playa Aware
[1:24:50] timbres: yeah but idk if you know this, but ‚ÄúJP‚Äù is XQC!
[1:24:52] feranmixy: 25-35k i think
[1:24:53] Mr_Nee: Even if we say BUTC is $5k today, that would mean the rack is $16,000
[1:25:02] Sandeeptha: @reagon_plays 20-25K
[1:25:13] AloofMango: Like you guys would not sell with that high profit margin to a group like vagos you are friends with. Def make some profit but quadrule the cost is insane
[1:25:21] Sandeeptha: Its hard to put a price on butcoin though since its so new
[1:25:24] LudIkrIZz: @Mr_Nee costs 3 buttcoin for drone app
[1:25:27] KentKLS: What is the 6k evaluation based on then ?
[1:25:39] Mr_Nee: @LudIkrIZz very true
[1:25:40] AloofMango: peepoGiggles
[1:25:41] Canahealz: need to clean the trash out of the house when you get time
[1:26:07] KentKLS: what are the comps for a rack i thought it was cheap
[1:26:22] AloofMango: made all the unlocking cost in one sale OMEGALUL
[1:26:41] scha_de: @KentKLS 2 BUTC for blueprint, 100 wood and 200 alloy in mats
[1:26:51] AloofMango: @KentKLS 6k is cheap isnt it?
[1:27:01] timbres: The solution is you just have to be on the server 24/7, easy
[1:27:05] 911_raj: Let's get our own turf
[1:27:06] Sandeeptha: I think they valued butcoin 10k each a week ago, but it makes no sense now because its not as rare
[1:27:30] JimLaw: time and hardware
[1:27:36] luckerooni: yea so far butc has severe cost and zero value lmao
[1:27:45] KentKLS: 200 alloy at 4 per and 100 wood at what like 10 per max ? how is that 6k
[1:27:45] epic_smee: BTC will decrease over time anyways
[1:27:49] Mitashkii: you pay to start mining early
[1:27:51] epic_smee: Probably to 1k

[1:28:05] Mr_Nee: i imagine some big BUTC sinks in the future, at least there should be
[1:28:18] AloofMango: they get it for 7 EZ
[1:28:21] luckerooni: BUTC is entirely FOMO
[1:28:26] Sandeeptha: yeah no for sure
