[6:40:24] aluckynewb: benchs and mats is the problem atm
[6:40:25] comfycathie: I hope long term the crafting queue will be improved for high volume

[6:40:44] Bejdy23: Im really missing racing scene :d I really hope it will come back at some point
[6:40:46] lagunavex: I just don't see material volume being able to sustain that
[6:40:48] TheElderOwlbear: For this you have to have materials
[6:40:51] shpuddie: nodd volume would do wonders to the price
[6:40:53] stylzo_: Skill issue + dentt + L * ratio tbh on most of the people just trying to make quick big money RIPBOZO
[6:40:56] mugcostanza: the volume will be there eventually
[6:40:57] TheFightspit: Also when there will be more materials
[6:41:07] fraij: Long term you will probably also have a sign in board
[6:41:13] rmcgowan: If Mary was even able to get a ticket system like Snr. Buns has for her employees, that immediately changes the math for parts too. Because once that happens you can price parts so much cheaper because mechanics aren't relying on them for income
[6:41:17] aluckynewb: lang is taking longer to get the mats so i hope something change nodd
[6:41:19] ibruticus: "future plan" chat nodd
[6:41:40] PsychoBKilla: Yep
[6:41:44] mugcostanza: kyliebList
[6:42:04] darkestnight333: The issue is your using a realworld buisiness mind/model to work your way up the system in power and cash and alot of people are using streamer brain and getting mad that it doesn't work
[6:42:11] miicrowv: landawgg bawrry maryying alexx

[6:43:03] eborcurean: the pd gun/flashlight charge Angel dealt with, doesn;t even include a flashlight
[6:43:23] vladdity: the order you put in Lang was crazy but if every car needs 2-3 sets 100 sets is enough to repair 2 cars an hour over 24hrs
[6:43:24] Qyuyu: the job of mechanic is always weird because you get payed by people instead of the state which comes with a lot of drama

[10:46:19] rmcgowan: @shpuddie It's not risky per se, because he's right. It is a casino. There is a very good chance she gets the money back. But the real question is how much will $50k be worth in a year? We really can't know. A year from now $75k might be worth less than it is now, a lot less. It might be worth the same.
[10:46:22] illifis: So it could be much longer than a year
[10:46:48] SARcasm19: That doesn't sound bad but what garantees this casino does as well as the last one
