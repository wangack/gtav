[0:19:29] Frostlogic: Is it difficult to differentiate between what Cornwood knows and what Esfand knows?
[0:19:29] BeerRun204: I have a problem with the whole.mindset RP or not. They claim it's a family irl I see someone charge one of my fellow brothers with a knife I might dump 3 mags in them and it's justified

[0:19:41] DunDeezZ: You didn't say what happend after you got off last night @esfandtv
[0:19:41] bonkvpg: communication between everyone is fucked
[0:19:41] supaiiii: hmmMeeting
[0:19:41] Sabretooth91: The fact that the captains dont see that they are destroying the pd IC and OOC is baffling
[0:19:42] KooterNoodle: YUP RUTH

[0:19:43] Van_1912: ruth said her treason comment, which she said like 3 times...was a joke.    but cornwood jokes and its a dap.
[0:19:44] TheHippieStench: Yo, Max chewed the hell out of the captains. Finally someone that isnt scared to call Ruth a clown. (not saying cornwood is scared, he just has a lot more to lose than the MAYOR!)

[0:19:45] Welshstig: hurts ooc
[0:19:45] Toluen090: Captains ooc don't care seems like
[0:19:45] Norkatanes: not american wath does it mean  one last for san bass ? i don't know how to spell it
[0:19:45] FHviding: @widbar it's not, just ooc crap tbh
[0:19:46] ArtificialHelix: @ObiJUANcannoliii What you mean, shes arrested now LUL
[0:19:46] EmDuBB13: if they don’t reinstate you I pray max makes you commissioner or sheriff just despite them having their head in the sand
[0:19:48] SmugPls: Only slacks feels this way it seems
[0:19:49] ArOOk: mhm yeah
[0:19:49] Raja_Banhammer: ABOBA INTEGRITY
[0:19:50] Totikki: Captains should have someone above them to keep them in check, dunno about Mayor, should be Cheif of police
[0:19:50] d4rk3nergy: They are essentially killing RP
[0:19:51] KaysKhaos: you see the clip of what Ruth said after walking out?
[0:19:51] Bluepop420: fuck the RP PD and run for mayor. then fix these problems
[0:19:51] s1cKNation: Ruth is the mayor problem shrujj

[0:19:53] Recon_XoX: Max is gonna have Ruth's head on a platter before this is all over
[0:19:53] peteryacono: right
[0:19:54] jacksmithcje: captains have decided that the person who has put the most hours money and care into the pd image is bad for the pd
[0:19:55] MrNoFear: its already lost imo
[0:19:55] tbdm55: but the captains dont see it that way
[0:19:55] SurelyBaked: literally if Slacks + Ruth were removed the PD's image and morale would be night and day
[0:19:56] rodolfo872: The point that the captains issue the DAP and then review those same DAPs is a good point to review
[0:19:56] daberan: too late
[0:19:58] Citystar619: Its RP and a video game...just RP a different way
[0:19:58] PrettyKrazy: when civs dont even know HOW to call 911 in thats not good
[0:19:59] RavagedPistol: too late

[0:20:06] Vexiaaa: it makes people question whether or not they want to continue playing too.
[0:20:07] blowaways: oh shit last night was crazy
[0:20:07] lawlkat: @EsfandTV are you really not going to join this meeting?
[0:20:07] griffin2622: way too late
[0:20:10] U62charlie: people are usually always being funny when convenient for them
[0:20:10] rocker22_: its crazy how it has caused dean to be terrified to play den out of fear of not being able to play PD
[0:20:10] w111iam1: Saab doesn’t care about that
[0:20:12] Dash_O_Pepper: Are you not wearing a suit to the council meeting?

[0:20:18] bbbrabbit123: The captains doesn't see the concept of layoffs that's been festering the PD, everyone is on the edge of their sit just because of daps.

[0:27:35] POTRIPPER1: everybody else is more upset than cornwood
[0:27:36] SurelyBaked: tbh cornwood is probably gonna get fired just because command doesn't want to deal with the drama which is dumb
[0:27:36] Beep_Cx: Reading texts Looking
[0:27:38] skeletonmike: cornwood gets fired not because of the daps but because of the way he talked to slacks
[0:27:38] jahim_: do cornwood would realy think that he still have job after that all and fired danzel?

[0:27:41] StormiNyan: @mad0monk that comment last night better get her fired ezz
[0:27:42] rocker22_: I think they set a heavy precedent by firing Den and still saying they saw improvement. Cornwoods DAPS are far worse so he should be fired if Den did

[0:27:52] Cunder: you should of said your Cornwood
[0:27:53] shin5sato3: @DiscretionaI naive
[0:27:57] HerrWienerschnitzel: I think cornwood is fired anyways and this situation isn't really fixable

[0:28:05] Thraxton1: I mean the Captains pretty much operate on a basis off "always beleive the worst of every officer" so there's not much chance for Cornwood

[0:28:11] rocker22_: Etta susge
[0:28:11] Silvertap: @EsfandTV U don't know but all captans are backstabing u man... that is sad, because Cornwood is blind loyal and they don't deserve his loyalty...

[1:03:28] spazticbull: why are captains the only ones not looking at the document in real time?
[1:03:28] Silvertap: At this point Beric should be comisioner
[1:03:28] 1CaptainRedBeard1: Cornwood plays around a lot. They kind of hate that. UNFORTUNATELY if your'e going to be in a position of power you'll have to dial that in.

[1:03:31] PrettyKrazy: the captains cant look at it or only council/lawyers?
[1:03:32] McKibbo: they take partial information, and not the whole story because of non-verbatim statements taken. then interpret that and think they already have a solution
[1:03:32] McAze: even duncan didnt know exactly your plan and asked to write it
[1:03:35] blgsnack09: Kael Soze for commisoner

[1:03:38] ens0mniac: Cornwood goes for the joke instead of trying to make his point though @esfandtv
[1:03:38] clowniusthe1st: itll be a massive call for the pd if cornwood isnt let back in
[1:03:38] evilmoose__: to be fair the way he is saying it is much more clear
[1:03:39] blahder: Also cornwood does enough sbs to give people against him ammo
[1:03:39] Xierany: Captains aren't listening, or at least haven't been. The Mayor's meeting last night shows just that
[1:03:39] catfish_quackenbush: cornwood is not great at talking well, cw talks a lot and a lot to say, but its not always clear and to the point
[1:03:39] xxs0undchildxx: @Lucsvm lol

[1:03:53] Haretic: id be curious if the captains were hired under the guise of "do not be like the 5 year ago department" or something more specific is why they were so "hardass"
[1:03:54] RicoLoco52: This combination of the captains is the direct reason for the way the PD is and is seen by everyone. and they seem to think they don't deserve to have any oversight themselves

[1:18:11] big_dave1991: @EsfandTV makes sense in rp too as you have been doing lawyer work
[1:18:12] RexPappa: but it also fits his character that hes an older fella that likes to retell the same story
[1:18:12] LiterallySteve: I think cornwood's problem is he starts a conversation and 30 things try to push and pull him in every direction before he can finish lol @EsfandTV

[1:18:19] GoofyMaskedGoober: OHMEGALUL nice emote
[1:18:19] slight621: Max should send a picture of his middle finger
[1:18:19] slodisgood: I think the captains think that Max is out to get power, but I'm pretty sure that he just wants people to stop talking to him about PD shit.
[1:18:20] jeremyks9: Captains will still be captains with just some reviewing their actions
[1:18:20] EsfandTV: @only_good_comments that's not true it's a serious character but also with good comedy
[1:18:21] Frankendoink: @Kizzlefoshizzle, really good point, i like that idea
[1:18:21] ChitChilli: metaphors will only be taken as the persons way of comprehending them
[1:18:21] xiouq1: @shmeeso the two extremes
[1:18:22] slomojosh: MmmHmm peeTime
[1:18:22] 18james78: Him seeing how effective Crane is, and how he's saying the same stuff, is the RP moment to make Cornwood more succinct
[1:18:22] Rivath: Crane has obviously mediated a lot of bs irl
[1:18:23] ZealotPara: is that just a cornwood problem or is it also an esfand problem? KEKW

Cornwood used his own money to buy 88s and 99s when they came availble to put in the CVPIs, they were availble the whole time during each storm, if they show up. The Caps told the officers, they would get funding to buy things, so no officers bought anything for a shared vehicle.

[2:46:55] MillerThyme: TOO MUCH SBS
[2:46:55] condor2104: They might even stop you putting your nam ein for Sherrif
[2:46:55] TeeaHeCee: And he never comes back after it too
[2:46:56] nickdrawsstuff: Remember when Ruth tried to use the fact that the Cornwood model specifically requires special textures, and that you didn't have an actual PD uniform as actual RP content against you?
[2:46:56] wolfgang_86: SAJ
[2:46:56] gillilliland: they think they are serious when they spend 2 hours a day max online
[2:46:56] HeyMeghan: have they given you a time and date for the review? didn’t slacks say he would have that for you by Friday?

[2:47:01] Wetidiot: not sure how pd treat cornwood like a meme

[2:47:03] iwannanuhh: OOC 4.0 has been super frustrating to alot of people i feel

[2:47:08] Mjolnrrr: revenge arc
[2:47:09] vorcandracos: You are not serious enough
[2:47:10] zilaprime: This could be a good learning point for Cornwood. Learning to trust people less/be more careful?
[2:47:10] daltonlowe74: time for cornwood to stop being such a nice guy

[2:47:15] Istaf_SC: No happiness moon2A
[2:47:15] catfish_quackenbush: Technically you are not, cause of the whole 1 lifer, the joking, etc. The Caps want an NPC, they see your jokes, they dont care about you making people happy,

[2:47:17] after_shave: YEP we need to rank highest mmr on RP
[2:47:17] theredfrosts: @god_camnit 2 miles from downtown I lived across the streer
[2:47:17] MustacheWins: maybe you should not spend so many hours then
[2:47:17] Tiabbz: get the 1 dap reviewed by MALTON or MAX
[2:47:17] Orbilion: Im happy :)
[2:47:17] cytogeni: what happened to cornwood?
[2:47:18] leinad47: IF CORNWOOD DOESNT DO SHIT NOONE DOES pepW
[2:47:18] 360ski: So, they can't fire you Monday because of the "Not Union" contract, right!?
[2:47:18] phoenixvakarian: its not even knight's fault, the captains should've understood that it was a misunderstanding
[2:47:18] Icesevage: It was the SBS with Donald Bush, that was 5 days with suspension alone sadly.
[2:47:19] KooterNoodle: That’s Nakoda’s job
[2:47:19] Jerti_: maybe spend some time on another char
[2:47:20] SurelyBaked: dude if every RPer had the mentality of everyone having a good time none of these meetings would even be happening @EsfandTV
[2:47:20] ZuldeadTV: it should be renamed the cornwood act at this point
[2:47:20] DoseofDewey: And to think all this started with Mr. K and Johnson fighting lol
[2:47:21] AshleyJordan235: BUT RUTH CAN JOKE ABOUT TREASON…
[2:47:21] PacGamer: That's why I don't like the it's just rp andys, everyone on the server is putting in irl time
[2:47:21] brandontko: ruth only get son for 2 hours every other day and does her 9-8 irl job kekw
[2:47:21] theblackdog808: Welcome to Los Santos LUL
[2:47:22] icephrogg: the captains dont think you are fit for sheriff
[2:47:22] predatorop91: knight did the right thing
[2:47:22] jwells302: is it expected that you are a straight up by the book police officer
[2:47:22] 8bit_amethyst: Cornwood is a threat to those above him because he's actually good at what he does
[2:47:22] Brakon: To invested esfand is the one actually rping the character if anything we as chatters are to invested
[2:47:22] APE_KlNG: you can’t make everyone happy
[2:47:22] Wetidiot: not sure how pd treat cornwood like a meme when he does so much for them
[2:47:22] el_jotaro_: its time to focus on your own happiness now
[2:47:22] psychosnef: talk to koil, isnt there a rule for onelifer and what follows etc ?

[2:47:25] ToyLetTreat: U DID ACTUALLY DRAW A HAMBURGER IN UR NOTES INSTEAD OF TAKING NOTES MAN
[2:47:25] w111iam1: Yup it’s real life now Kappa
[2:47:26] MrDher: Beric in chat! Pog
[2:47:26] Zumarchon: "too much SBS" people that think RP needs to be serious more than 80% of the time are crazy
[2:47:26] DrCashew: The RP is too real sometimes. An accusation never leaves you irl.
[2:47:27] BaltorrShock: can't make everyone happy. gotta realize there are people working against you
[2:47:27] biscuitz1776: people suck rp and irl
[2:47:27] Skrub_Lord: I dont think theres anything OOC
[2:47:27] TheKingOfWit: I thought FTOs were considered senior
[2:47:27] iceman2190: iceman2190 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:47:28] SpikerzX: All 3 captains think you are incapable of doing your job after the excessive force
[2:47:28] Vengy: @EsfandTV you should bring that up to the captains honestly.  You dedicated so many more hours than everyone else.
[2:47:29] ArtByBriannaJoy: this is why I like onx tbh
[2:47:29] MHOPjr: pretty sure you  cant make everyone happy
[2:47:29] TeejayOCE: RP is a IRL simulator, not a fun game YEP
[2:47:30] Joongi_: monkaW
[2:47:30] REDMVGE: rp viewers are dumb. mad when you're invested, mad when you're not
[2:47:31] Brave_Silver: I do wonder how much longer the 4.0 RP is gonna last
[2:47:31] ClausFC92: alot of snake characters
[2:47:31] PrettyKrazy: Looking
[2:47:31] BG2580: Brian Knight was a big catalyst for this change in RP
[2:47:31] Neekapkilla: Your only chance of not getting fired is getting Turner to listen to you about Knight lying. He is the only Captain who might possibly listen
[2:47:32] wolfgang_86: Cornwood woke up today no longer naive @EsfandTV
[2:47:32] Shakeboxing: They'll end up making you Chief of Police @EsfandTV I have this feeling :D
[2:47:32] SurelyBaked: HOLD
[2:47:32] shoehorn_oh_plenty: atpToiler RUTH POV
[2:47:32] seniorbunss: Brian Knight doesnt even wake up

[2:47:33] SmugPls: chats moving to fast NotLikeTHis
[2:47:34] bizzy2628: slacks looks out for himself
[2:47:35] 8bit_amethyst: Leadership looking out for themselves first
[2:47:37] condor2104: You will probabaly have no chance for Sheriff as well
[2:47:37] darthpuff2544: We need the LASO like right now
[2:47:37] PicklemanJaro: the main point is that this is causing OOC drama and worry and thats not good for the PD
[2:47:37] Leafyerick: xdd
[2:47:38] PungentMango: nah everyone loves cornwood ooc
[2:47:38] KiplinHD: cornwood trusts people because esfand trusts people
[2:47:39] PrettyKrazy: WTF
[2:47:39] vazeline__: Who’s the guy speaking twitch?
[2:47:39] Atrix646: Listening
[2:47:40] Xierany: @EsfandTV Slacks and Seniors talked about promoting like 2 weeks ago, and DAPs were the only reason why you weren't considering. They talked about how far you've come
[2:47:40] itschampa: people seem to hold onto a lot of peoples 3.0 character past and not 4.0
[2:47:40] Zedowel: Imagine when the commissioner finds out the lack of representatuib from the liason
[2:47:41] Lofty916: i have been watching for an hour and have no clue whats happening
[2:47:41] sodrdie: yeah you worked your ass off and finally the server is progressing a little bit but you are left behind, feelsbadman
[2:47:42] Shmoopee: ALL CORNWOODS DAPs ARE SBS FUN RP
[2:47:42] EleWiggle: Trynna make people happy is what PD is for NoPixel
[2:47:43] quaylewastaken: really
[2:47:43] femboysthighs: Many other people are basing their characters opinions off OOC info, you're one of the only people actually staying true to RP, it's sad
[2:47:43] FoxOnTheWall: uh ohy
[2:47:43] ManakinEU: its all fucking ooc politcs
[2:47:44] ens0mniac: I’d try to make sure you understand what the council is for before complaining some things aren’t brought up by nekoda though @esfandtv

[2:47:52] k9_goliath: The Revival of Cornwood is what has helped 4.0 blow up so far
[2:47:53] bullet_soul24: Corn is perfect for commissioner but that'll never happen
[2:47:53] fishmeatx: its sad this for content n laughs and people are treating it way too seriously probably cuz of twitch chat
[2:47:53] Recon_XoX: kekw

[2:49:33] outlawpickle: Bones dislikes Cornwood
[2:49:33] ViscountRe: @EsfandTV It's especially annoying because you could see that Cornwood was adapting to the system and acclimating to it, like telling Johnson to chill out, etc. but the DAP system doesn't account for that growth because it happened over hours instead of weeks.

[2:49:56] JakeStratic: @EsfandTV The capts are corrupt. Biggest reason you got full dapped was because they got jealous that they came to you over them.

[2:51:44] Sharkcity77: saabb 100% hates punishing cornwood LULW
[2:51:46] evilmoose__: @esfandtv Flop said same thing about his character on his stream.
[2:51:46] kingjoely: @cdarx2 but he never acts on that though
[2:51:46] 360ski: But Crims come and complain about Cops(Captains) about the officers and the Captains (esp Slacks) will hold that against the officer. So essentially they take the word of the Crims over their own officers!
[2:51:47] WineNot: they call him CG Baas for a reason
[2:51:47] LivingLawless: I will always give props to cornwood. my fav sheriff and people know you know where to draw the line
[2:51:48] MysticCasey: Someone else had to bring it up for him to talk on it. ICANT
[2:51:49] JakeStratic: @EsfandTV You're very massively applying OOC "his/they are my friend" and refusing to understand how much you're being betrayed in RP. Love Cornwood but it isn't just Cornwood loyalty @EsfandTV
[2:51:50] LJD420: Clueless Slacks acting in good faith
[2:51:51] Chitters2004: grime going to make no money then?
[2:51:51] Trystah: sorry but slacks is a snake from what ive seen
[2:51:51] Fatty_Tatties: @EsfandTV  looking around the streams, some of the most honest streamers are ironically the Criminals. Ramee has been 100% faithful as far as I can tell
[2:51:52] HealzPleaze: sub only on slacks stream says otherwise lol
[2:51:52] GoofyMaskedGoober: @ESFANDTV Do this NOWAYING when Nekoda speak

[2:51:55] Buster_Buster: FirstTimeChatter
[2:51:56] ip33fr331y: this must be a really uncomfortable position for Nakota to sit in. Under Cornwood. With Cornwood, knowing he doesn’t say shit for the PD.
[2:51:57] thaflamezzz: u making Saab and example lol copium
[2:51:57] EleWiggle: Ssaab wanna counter Meta Chatters by doing the other way around
[2:51:57] LaLips: Slacks pretends that he does
[2:51:58] Honorspren: @Munchaussen all the police there mag dumped
[2:51:58] DonnBeach: I don't think Flop went against you but he didn't advocate for you as much as I would have thought
[2:51:58] ZuldeadTV: First Time dentt
[2:51:59] watsthecrai: what happens if you get sacked cornwood Cheer100
[2:51:59] monkz89: Saab is good faith, but cornwood will still get fired and it will be justified
[2:51:59] lawlkat: @EsfandTV Why do you still trust Slacks? you said in character that he was as bad as Ruth.
[2:51:59] s1cKNation: Finally nekoda
[2:52:00] Code_Man_83: Why is Cornwood at the city council meeting? Is he providing information on something, or acting in a lawyer capacity for something?
[2:52:02] flaminghotcheetos69: @esfandtv how come you pull up peoples chats on stream even when being nice? Some people find that embarrassing:/
[2:52:03] SarahFlare: OVER 9,000?!?!?!

[2:52:07] BeerRun204: Berick is loyal and should be undersheriff
[2:52:08] RietArtwork: Siobhan is a Cornwood
[2:52:08] spoop: I think flop and Cornwood are ideologically aligned on how the PD should move forward
[2:52:09] theredfrosts: There was a 0 percent thought in my mind that you would go and help break the police department but you did.
[2:52:11] DarthRadonis: Well it is a Packer
[2:52:11] traemblz: @Munchaussen FirstTimeChatter

[2:52:44] fishmeatx: cornwood almost fully BASED
[2:52:45] catfish_quackenbush: @DonnBeach beacuse technically, in character, flop still believe teh mag dump was completly uncalled for. That "good faith" moment cost Cornwood more than he though it would
[2:52:46] GlitchyGunZ: You see the mayor and Ruth clips from last night @esfandtv

There were like 3 cops, 2 cadets that Slacks utilized who was there to try and secure K if he tried to escape his warrent (even gave K a chance to turn himself in). When K ran and other suspects got involved, that's when that whole scenario escalated. That's how I understood the situation from Slacks POV (radio communication etc..)

[3:13:57] Xierany: Only for PD, it's good crim RP
[3:13:58] BradXeno: I think cop vehicles should be balanced to not need or allow turbos so the stealing can be a thing for crims, but not effect PD

[3:14:24] philmagroin1: there has to be some mechanic where you have to agree to modifications when working on cars. they wouldn’t remove something without your knowledge
[3:14:25] fixer_18: This is IC
[3:14:26] ManakinEU: @EsfandTV the problem is people pulling them out from underneathe the car

[3:14:29] w111iam1: YES but they’re ignoring you
[3:14:29] outlawpickle: youre not on the council, dont stick your neck out while PD is looking for more reasons to fire you
[3:14:30] TurismoKing89: PD needs it own mechanic

[3:14:33] WretchedRoyal: it would make a very interesting investigation
[3:14:33] 360ski: Yes
[3:14:33] snowbones_: they can make a mini-game for it as well so its trial and error

[3:14:36] catloyalist: Thats not your job and youd be stepping on Nacoda shoes if you do that
[3:14:37] Kryptonautti: You are not part of the council, you are there just to provide insight. You are like a specialist on the matter, with no vote. @esfandtv
[3:14:37] itschampa: a lot of the turbos being stolen are dumb people just handing someone they dont know keys to there car
[3:14:37] Myiuss: they are taking out a red hot turbo with bare hands make it take tools/time
[3:14:38] Sonicfear: Obviously you are fishing for support...so sure go ahead.
[3:14:38] J_Stomi: sell all the 99 you have, you are getting fired anyway LUL
[3:14:40] powrslave: put turbos on the blockchain
[3:14:40] AnOkBard: you can also just ask if you can bring it to their attention to warn them at the very least
[3:14:40] 360ski: BINGO
[3:14:41] Kohilenn: or set alarms in vehicles
[3:14:41] jeffrey778: the turbo thing is, i feel a sort of kind of exploit at least the dev sould know
[3:14:41] w111iam1: SERIALIZE
[3:14:41] Felrane: yep and then you can mark it stolen
[3:14:42] carefreespreee: well turbos are stamped irl
[3:14:42] MadderHatter: the main issue is that cornwood shouldn't be paying for pd equipitment they should have their own turbos
[3:14:42] Raja_Banhammer: GET THEM TO LEGALIZE RANCH PagMan
[3:14:43] quaylewastaken: there already doing that for the ammo\
[3:14:43] dapyman: Serialized & registered like a car
[3:14:46] x_juiceman: You were invited so might as well provide your insight
[3:14:46] Pandrax86: Not just turbos, Transmissions and any future engine parts.
[3:14:46] yatesy118: Serialise everything tbh
[3:14:46] Chitters2004: tricky when legitimately sold a few times
[3:14:46] Coreytries: they’re not watching cause they didn’t pay for them @esfandtv
[3:14:46] Trystah: Moon is a fantastic mayor tbh
[3:14:46] suzzanne___: uh oh
[3:14:47] nick_cringe: Maybe they can make it like a mini game to steal them
[3:14:48] spoop: Serialise the turbos and add a charge for tampering with a government vehicle
[3:14:49] blowaways: but how do you sell turbos then
[3:14:49] Cat_God22: yes let nakota bring it up as a sign of respect
[3:14:50] apepi: I say to take a turbo out of a car, you need to replace it with one.
[3:14:50] jukla12: @EsfandTV they have to make it in a way the turbo stay on the hand
[3:14:52] HeyMeghan: serializing or giving people a receipt for the when they buy them
[3:14:52] ZilzGaming: wait how are people stealing turbos if you need a garage to install them?
[3:14:52] Naphtax: but people sell their turbos to other people
[3:14:53] ZuldeadTV: but previously purchased turbos wouldn't have serials right?
[3:14:53] Nickomongo: serial number or receipts of purchase at Mosleys
[3:14:55] TheCarnifex: If cornwood would bring it up then there is the answer
[3:14:56] w111iam1: MOSLEY RECEIPTS
[3:14:56] MackPlays: It's interesting they let a disgraced 2x suspended officer in this
[3:14:58] heartsonlysoren: as his lawyer its your job to message him the suggestion, and not to talk
[3:14:59] ignorantfall: NOPERS cant take my smortble
[3:15:01] blowaways: you cant serialise without transferring ownership and thts a harder mechanic
[3:15:02] ReneLorent: IS THERE ANY NEWS ON THE SHERRIFS OFFICE?
[3:15:02] MadderHatter: when they steal them now it's personal theft against cornwood
[3:15:02] m3lenny: problem is esfand, stealing turbos is powergaming in my opinion. Weight wise, time wise and the way you do it and nobody might notice it. That is my opinion.
[3:15:02] emery_steele: no perms
[3:15:03] Sniffle04: high office report
[3:15:04] layla109: Yess serializing would stop theft the quickest, unless they steal em and then ocean dump the vehicle.
[3:15:05] Stryfe_81: you are a man of LS, so bring up a concern about turbos
[3:15:06] Firehead94: @EsfandTV make it more complicated. Can buy locks for the engine bay / hoods but can be broken open with the grinder tool. Could attach VINs to them and only PD can swap the VINs if sold. @EsfandTV
[3:15:07] Zendorea: @EsfandTV Ask Crane for access
[3:15:07] fishmeatx: Stare chat touch grass also drink water

[3:15:09] SSteinyy: 1913
[3:15:09] Kohilenn: turbos should also be carried like HVAC loot
[3:15:09] clevergamerboy: So what happened?
[3:15:10] quaylewastaken: @yatesy118 thats the issue there seriralizing  gun ammo
[3:15:13] Tcmasterzzz: pd meeting but longer and more interesting this
[3:15:14] Eruwawa: Can you make PD turbos as police equipment as a charge? @EsfandTV
[3:15:14] KappaManJason: you dont have acess
[3:15:17] Apollocreed32: WHAT HAPPENED
[3:15:17] imataka12: FirstTimeChatter
[3:15:17] EsfandTV: @m3lenny, it's not powergaming, powergaming is exploiting
[3:15:18] outlawpickle: @ReneLorent dont expect it for months at this rate
[3:15:20] xGameShock: @Naphtax yeah so u would just hand over some kinda document or proof of sale as a seller
[3:15:21] ItsLucuss: Would it work if you sell turbos on to someone else though?
[3:15:21] Shmoopee: I think. let the Crims have fun with it for mow
[3:15:22] w111iam1: @renelorent not today next week
[3:15:22] Skycoh: is MOONMOON a Dev or Admin?
[3:15:23] Loco_Cubano: @EsfandTV the thing is the way they are being robbed is without rp. They are yoinking them with whats practically an exploit, leaving no evidence behind and no interacting with the victim
[3:15:24] LHaxorP: cant see council reports sad
[3:15:24] Kitty_poo_poo: FirstTimeChatter
[3:15:25] theblackdog808: But yeah receipts or serial/vin proof would help
[3:15:26] ZuldeadTV: ocean dumping pd turbos WICKED
[3:15:26] HallusH: you need to make proof of ownership of an item like that
[3:15:26] ens0mniac: I think there’s some confusion about what this meeting is… this meeting is for in-character solutions @esfandtv
[3:15:28] Apollocreed32: Is this for him eating corn the long way? @EsfandTV
[3:15:29] jahim_: you can send idea to serialise turbo to max as citizen idea now
[3:15:29] jeffrey778: accsessing the undercarage of a car from 20 feet away needs to be fixed
[3:15:29] clevergamerboy: @esfandtv can you give me a short and dirty on what happened I just got off work
[3:15:31] ReneLorent: tnx

[3:15:46] Kaztiell: chat is power gaming
[3:15:47] imaginairemusic: Registration is crazy, if it's serialized so you can investigate and match reports up that would be cool, but if a turbo just tells you who it's owned by that seems too much imo
[3:15:47] Devilishtay: aaout
[3:15:52] bertacharm: o7
[3:15:54] God_is_a_cat_girl: @carefreespreee yeah, I worked on a truck parts warehouse and had to catalog turbos with the serial numbers

[3:15:56] PrettyKrazy: its only really powergaming if the state says so... until then its just scummy...

[3:16:09] HAYNEZz: how would that work with locals they still stop at reds
[3:16:09] outlawpickle: @EsfandTV what makes your so optimistic that corn will keep his job?

[3:16:27] Wintyer2: highways should be 100

[3:17:46] m3lenny: I come from the RP Scene like DnD and other Tabletop and i use powergaming in a different sense, esfand. But yeah, didnt know how nopixel is ruling on this one.
[3:17:47] Gachiguru: @EsfandTV not even when he defended Ruth for Chief of Police LMAO
[3:17:47] goodheavens89: I think Nekoda is a good cop first and foremost... Thats from other characters point of view though
[3:17:48] Shakestar: he also knows Cornwood is right next to him right now
[3:17:48] RobialT: Knight is a good cop
[3:17:48] Glitch3dGames: Then y is he not bringing up anything to help PD
[3:17:48] Phattiest: he is a Ruth lap snake
[3:17:49] Dregg0: but he should be bring stuff up every meeting
[3:17:49] MadderHatter: what are you talking about? he's in with the captains for sure, he totally backstabbed you last meeting

[3:17:51] RTJ_Drops: wow chat
[3:17:51] DrEZPZ: you literally witnessed him not speak up without being forced into the subject @esfandtv
[3:17:51] D3ggz: 1000% Snake just has the captains best intrest
[3:17:52] mercs99: being a snake isnt about how they are to your face though, but about how they are to others *cough* etta *cough*
[3:17:52] ItsLucuss: I don't think Nekoda is proactive enough to be in the council
[3:17:54] Astral_Rage: There are so many snakes you would not believe
[3:17:54] magnets_: he's gotten a ton of fines and charges updated in every meeting before this. i think he's playing this meeting lowkey bc of the anti pd sentiments from earlier @EsfandTV
[3:17:54] PrettyKrazy: Clueless what is a snake?
[3:17:55] spazticbull: i dont know about a snake but definitely an extension of the captains and not of the pd
[3:17:55] humanhere2: I don't think he's a snake... he's a diplomat, and will not speak on things NOT approved by the captains....that's how he views his role.
[3:17:55] Coreytries: that’s what snakes do lmao @esfandtv
[3:17:55] Smypher: @EsfandTV People need to remember that Nekoda has like 100 things brought to him inbetween meetings so he's trying his best
[3:17:56] fishmeatx: this shit has people windin up
[3:17:56] Tiabbz: SLACKS is the snake. not Ruth, not nekoda
[3:17:58] CrystalDimension: CHAT COULD LINK YOU CLIPS I'M SURE Kappa @EsfandTV

[3:18:00] ip33fr331y: The police department liaison has absolutely nothing to say about new traffic laws?

[3:18:01] holyknightfran: snakes everywhere
[3:18:01] DrWetbone: if anyone has an agenda they are a snake.
[3:18:01] alpine_ibex2: Not a snake, but he is the captains mouthpiece @EsfandTV
[3:18:02] carefreespreee: snakes hide in the grass and bite you when unseen and threatened
[3:18:04] Fozenoh: I am the snake chat.. 8.1 snake HandsUp
[3:18:04] woundedpoptart: I don't see it either, at most it seems he just does nothing rather than snaking around
[3:18:05] noah_a_104: 👌
[3:18:06] ip33fr331y: That is hard to understand.
[3:18:06] crescenterra: not a snake, more like not suited for the job, lacks initiative and leadership traits from what we've seen @EsfandTV
[3:18:08] Loco_Cubano: @EsfandTV I have no idea if he is or isn't but if he is two faced you would not know or rather Cornwood wouldn't until he is told or he catches it himself
[3:18:08] noah_a_104: stockholm syndrome
[3:18:08] ens0mniac: he’s 100% with the captains when they believe Cornwood has been stepping out of line and causing problems that led to that legislation @esfandtv
[3:18:09] ignorantfall: snakes are scary
[3:18:09] PrettyKrazy: xdd vp
[3:18:09] CowGuns: CowGuns subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 17 months! 
[3:18:10] RTJ_Drops: smh
[3:18:11] WayILive: he might just not be good at liaison, doesn’t mean he is a snake or operating in bad faith
[3:18:12] rhaziaa: Jesus is calling the mayor?
[3:18:17] ZPanda_MS: @EsfandTV don't that have to use mosely's to take out turbos? If that's is the case why not make a charge for it. Something like a felony, Criminal use of a Government owned business
[3:18:17] yahii: !followage
[3:18:19] LeZenon: Susge dont trust nekoda
[3:18:20] icephrogg: do u think the captains are mad at cornwood after hearing what sioban said about union
[3:18:20] DezalbM: we all know the king snake is malton anyway
[3:18:22] LJD420: hes not a snake hes just shy you can tell
[3:18:23] KorinMoon: I think Nakota is being manipulated by the captains, he's not necessarily a snake
[3:18:25] chmod_R_777: gun to Nakoda's head: side with Officers or Captains... he picks Captains
[3:18:25] Shmoopee: I'm just stirring. the pot.
[3:18:26] poolking420: hes not brought up anything for the pd though
[3:18:26] ShadowedSeraphim: @esfandtv I assume Nekoda will only push what the captains will directly tell him to push
[3:18:28] bertacharm: i mean ive heard malcolm say nekoda just gonna gaslight cornwood
[3:18:29] FelipeLLs: xdd Yea hes not on 18hours a day
[3:18:31] MackPlays: We'll find out in RP
[3:18:31] ip33fr331y: Nakota is right here and apparently it awake and apparently not doing anything else. So he could certainly be speaking on new traffic laws.
[3:18:33] SmugPls: 100 things but nothing brought up GIGACHAD
[3:18:33] FelipeLLs: xdd
[3:18:35] CAPONE66420: lol have they talked about sani getting robbed 24/7 yet or they just worried about stoplights?
[3:18:36] PrettyKrazy: WhaT he has his own storyline???
[3:18:37] StreamElements: Watch my latest video: Streamers aren't people. Confirmed - https://youtube.com/watch?v=oGT-Tv6Eivg
[3:18:37] FreakTheMedic: the fact he wouldn’t let you in when the captains were talking is enough
[3:18:37] yahii: Lol
[3:18:42] MillerThyme: no one is stopusing that as a talking point
[3:18:43] R3d_Gum: cornwood need to grow balls
[3:18:43] chmod_R_777: hes like Brian
[3:18:43] SaltDem0n: I watch nekoda on his stream and he has specifically said, him and nekoda love cornwood just that sometimes cornwood can get ahead of himself
[3:18:46] ip33fr331y: It’s like the captains told him his job is to listen and not actually participate. And report back to them. Unless they tell him to do something.
[3:18:46] Craze098: Hes the sole reason fines and sentences have gone up what can he do, when officers like you are talking to max about the shit you should be telling him
[3:18:48] yahii: !followage
[3:18:48] CrystalDimension: @DrEZPZ THAT'S NOT BEING A SNEAK YET LUL
[3:18:49] D00Dlles: 100 things nothing to show at the meeting
[3:18:50] TripOnCatnip: You literally caught him lie to you
[3:18:51] MasonH95: MasonH95 subscribed with Prime. 
[3:18:52] grumpnamedjosh: how do they expect people to see a car going 60 through the city. the intersection could look clear, doesn’t make it clear as they start going through the intersection.
[3:18:52] spicyville: nekoda is 100% scared to bring up certain things because he’s scared of the captains
[3:18:52] twilightbaseballscene: yeah i think he's being pulled in a few directions
[3:18:53] w111iam1: @esfandtv Slacks was suprised Nekoda doesn’t give him all the info either
[3:18:54] omn___i: at this point every pd member is Susge
[3:18:54] fishmeatx: good to see productive convos RN
[3:18:57] heavyd834: nekoda has been manipulated unintentionally by the captains I think to represent them instead of the PD as a whole
[3:18:57] doctorreaper95: @EsfandTV there's some stuff like the bikes, that the pd has to ask for directly to the state so maybe that's why he doesn't bring some stuff up
[3:18:57] panchoxidado: the liasom is the PD way to talk to the mayor, but Nekoda only bring talkpoints previusly acepted by the capitans
[3:18:57] AsteriaMateria: OMEGALAUGHING
[3:18:59] LogicWeasel: EZ
[3:19:00] goodheavens89: Nekoda is the pd liason, isn't he primarily here for civilians not cops?
[3:19:01] MackPlays: People assume a lot instead of waiting and watching
[3:19:01] PrettyKrazy: WHAT
[3:19:01] watsthecrai: we warned he is a snake and reports direct back to the capts
[3:19:03] LHaxorP: @ShadowedSeraphim which has historically be nearly nothing haha

[3:32:59] GumpBrave: well tell that dude that that isnt how restitution works. theft is a charge and damages are assessed as costs in criminal cases ALL the time
[3:33:01] fishmeatx: sad you have to think around stuff like that
[3:33:01] ip33fr331y: you could message Shavon about making a lot regarding misuse of the mosleys garage.

[3:33:12] Kaseyfullofjoy: literally at PD meeting last night they said that cornwood runs his mouth too much @EsfandTV
[3:33:13] scallopppp: A master mechanic can remove a turbo out of any car
[3:33:14] imfukinlost: you guys need a personal mechanic in the garage

[3:33:18] claptil: He's most likely gonna get fired for being with the Mayor
[3:33:18] rylynch: he makes sense
[3:33:19] megasoy: @Gachiguru the cops didn't GSR anyone but Ramee and Mr K. He wasn't charged for murder. He was GSR negative. He wasn't charged for a stolen car. LUL

[3:33:22] SarahFlare: I think cornwood liek clear his throat to try to get attention and called on
[3:33:23] harrytitsmitchell: strong will overtakes weak will in a convo cornwood. it's just nature. cut him off midsentence NOW
[3:33:23] Lite_Ice: I thought cornwood wasnt afraid of anything

[3:33:29] elSilvan: he just said turbos dont doa nything
[3:33:29] skeletonmike: he just said turbos dont matter
[3:33:29] Faraom: @EsfandTV But if you just raise your hand, you would just be telling what is happening. There's no need to report it to change of command
[3:33:30] jessielight: Cornwood did his part sharing info with pd
[3:33:30] w111iam1: Nekoda would bad mouth you for speaking out of turn
[3:33:31] MrViceNice: raise your hand like the other assistant
[3:33:31] ArtificialHelix: I feel like top people are like "May I interject"
[3:33:32] jacksmithcje: you can totally ask if they would allow your opinion

[3:33:37] PrettyKrazy: chat relax the discussion is happening theres no issue omE
[3:33:37] ToyLetTreat: ur either in the cornwood doesnt give af or the following a lead to make a good leader
[3:33:38] LaserFractal: but you are here as legal help for the major not? so you can weight in your opinion I think @EsfandTV
[3:33:40] DonnBeach: Don't blame you for being conservative about it. I think it'd be fine though.
[3:33:41] ip33fr331y: Mosley‘s garage is government property. They are using government property to commit a crime. That could be the basis to make an enhanced crime for the turbo steal
[3:33:41] claptil: They even say that to lawyers
[3:33:42] x_juiceman: You have a lot of expertise on this issue though. I think your insight would be appreciated

[3:33:47] GooberGoof123: Haise your hand
[3:33:52] HarveyAndrews99: if corn could corn would
[3:33:55] nevfails: That's why people pull out their turbos when they go to sleep because somebody else will pull out their car and not Park them
[3:33:56] w111iam1: Nekoda and captains are mad you went to mayor LUL
[3:33:57] adox212: asking permission to speak is almost like speaking out right without permission. they gonna say he cant speak? never.

[3:38:53] AKing33: Objection weird
[3:38:53] bassjio: Is he suggesting turbo theft is failrp?
[3:38:53] TheFox0228: KEKW trying to imply powerful gaming because Turbo's are normally at the top of an engine
[3:38:54] Lordrune13: not true
[3:38:54] bonelessspaghet1: it shouldn't be possible to remove turbos when under the car
[3:38:55] Loco_Cubano: it 1000% is fail rp
[3:38:56] TheEmmorf: POWERGAMING
[3:38:57] bigpharmaa: old people just dont get it
[3:39:01] Coreytries: my turbo is under the engine lol

[3:39:02] PsychoJoker: That would be smart
[3:39:03] x_Gordo: think the mechanic emote makes them go under the car
[3:39:03] bobbybedstains: turbo goes where it fits
[3:39:04] claptil: Ok so you shouldn't do that then he's saying
[3:39:04] Skycoh: A SMARTPHONE APP
[3:39:04] Skrub_Lord: He is saying people are Powergaming if they steal it from under
[3:39:05] w111iam1: He didn’t know you can get it from under
[3:39:05] Leafyerick: @EsfandTV Doesn't matter the animation for entering the engine bay makes your crawl under the car
[3:39:05] MarvinOGravel: The problem is that non-car people probably don't realize that
[3:39:05] dapyman: Maybe, block the hole under the bays??
[3:39:05] laaazylemon: thats a good point actually
[3:39:05] Stagnation: literally what cornwood said ICANT
[3:39:05] Kawika219: lol turbos can even be rear mounted on an exhaust system KEKW
[3:39:06] dreggy69: that needs to be patched then
[3:39:07] Kelborn: turbos def not always at the top
[3:39:07] ManakinEU: yeah but even if its fail RP ppl dont give a fuck
[3:39:07] chef_daddie: OH SHIT YEAH BOOST GUAGE
[3:39:08] scallopppp: It's the people's fault at the end of the day. Hand keys over you're dumb at this point
[3:39:09] Alex_QT: He's an idiot if he thinks turbos are only ontop.
[3:39:09] bertacharm: even if its fail its that doesnt mean its not happening
[3:39:10] BustedAssBroke: They had a turbo on an EV too, game mechanics aren't true

[3:39:11] jy33130: LUL
[3:39:11] Mutalator: boost gauge next to the spedometer would be good
[3:39:12] Shmoopee: Alarm and a Dashboard indicator
[3:39:12] permacool: @EsfandTV hes insinuating banning for it
[3:39:13] Xiephr_tactiX: @EsfandTV locking nuts.... not an alarm
[3:39:13] nevfails: Third and never going to install a car loan for a turbo getting pulled out everybody knows this
[3:39:16] Xierany: Not all turbos are installed up top, some are installed below, so no RP fail
[3:39:16] Rootbritney: @EsfandTV Michael is saying: People should RP that they cant remove the turbo from below LUL
[3:39:17] Aavakk: So hes basically saying its fail rp
[3:39:18] CrystalDimension: YEP IF THEY DECIDE IT'S FORBIDEN POWERGAMING THEN JUST BAN THEM FOR THAT
[3:39:18] CatBot1_: @TheFox0228 which is silly cause most people wont know anything like that
[3:39:19] w111iam1: That’d be cool
[3:39:20] fishmeatx: its not enough
[3:39:20] ArdentCause: Yeah i think people didn't realize what hes saying but yeah its just Fail RP / Terrible game mechanic
[3:39:20] Sieber13: Why can't they implement anti-tampering?
[3:39:21] scotty2thotty18: @bassjio seems kinda powergamey
[3:39:22] SavageTarzan: Classic
[3:39:22] nevfails: Car alarm sorry
[3:39:22] lighthawkd: can it flag an engine light to go on?
[3:39:22] Lucid_Jaydee: Random people wont know that it is fail RP
[3:39:24] jeffrey778: how do you make the game mechanic less reach
[3:39:25] vicrocity2009: they need an alarm that pings your phone when a turbo is removed for personal vehicles
[3:39:27] yossilives: a master mechanic has to remove it, alarm thing doesn’t make sense
[3:39:28] stellarnaut: fail RP but its almost impossible to report
[3:39:30] Gachiguru: stealing car modifications shouldnt be allowed to be honest
[3:39:30] ToyLetTreat: triple AAA has a software when my car is being tampered with
[3:39:30] wiltsne: when u sit in the car there would be an icon close to the speed/fuel info
[3:39:31] PrettyKrazy: yelling -1 dont get your turbo back chat omE
[3:39:33] ZPanda_MS: YOU CAN ONLY DO IT AT MOSELYS
[3:39:34] Braintew: @EsfandTV You could have an owner's code to remove the upgrade parts on personal vehicles.
[3:39:35] jeffrey778: is characyer
[3:39:38] CrystalDimension: @EsfandTV AND NOT JUST TURBOS, RIGHT ? OTHER PARTS TOO
[3:39:38] GoatNamedFeliciaa: Make it a hard minigame to remove the turbo like the roof running hack or harder EZ
[3:39:39] jacksmithcje: it’s not fair to ban people for hat imo people work under cars it’s plausible
[3:39:39] Titantrace1: I know cut off the arm
[3:39:40] Naruto_AMV_from_2007: dentt basically "Crims won't remove turbos because its not good RP if you do it from underneath"
[3:39:40] Skrub_Lord: He is saying people are Powergaming if they steal it from under as the turbo is located ontop of the engine
[3:39:40] GumpBrave: first, it's breaking and entering
[3:39:41] vicrocity2009: so when people steal ur shit and take ur turbo u are alerted on your phone
[3:39:41] 360ski: Cornwood back to 🤐🤐🤐🤐
[3:39:42] lowvr6tj: @bonelessspaghet1 turbos aren’t always on the top of an engine. sometimes not even in the front of a car.
[3:39:43] adox212: well, technically you can take it from both sides, top and bottom. depends on a car. only way to go around this is to make a serial numbers for turbo so you can track it
[3:39:43] permacool: @EsfandTV when he said its above the engine, hes saying its not good rp to take a car part, and its not good faith rp and should be reprimanded @EsfandTV
[3:39:44] Donkey__Rhubarb: there's already tampering, its the evidance trail thats the problem
[3:39:46] LDMz11: tbf a lot of turbos are removed from the bottom bc of them being connected to the exhaust system
[3:39:47] GumpBrave: second, you can have it as special property
[3:39:49] Tweetyy: they should just make it take longer to get them out. similar to how long it takes to gas up now
[3:39:49] qorzzz: The underneath access point in repair bay areas is not specifically for turbo's - but it ALLOWS people to sneakily steal them from that location
[3:39:49] TheIrishCanuck: @EsfandTV they're Australian turbos so they're on the bottom
[3:39:50] Pandrax86: Maybe you need to do a field trip and SHOW them what youre saying. I dont think they understand
[3:39:50] Wintyer2: @joebananas68 well does the game have a SKILL System cornwoods done a lot of skill work can only training people use the bottom
[3:39:53] catfishgaming93: all you really need is a sawall
[3:39:53] CaptBobito: the car should just not run without reprogramming it
[3:39:54] fishmeatx: its not fail RP if ur a crim SCUM
[3:39:54] Jrey000: @Braintew this is a good idea
[3:39:55] puppietreats: @jacksmithcje no
[3:39:55] GumpBrave: it's already breaking and entering too

[3:40:02] WayILive: it shouldn’t be an instant bolt off , it should take time to remove
[3:40:02] the_schlan: Its moreso proof of that is the same turbo stolen.  Peanut stole a car and 30 minutes later selling "a" 99 turbo on yellowpages
[3:40:03] Kroyd1: Make it take longer than instant to do
[3:40:03] Syfther: +1
[3:40:03] Fozenoh: EZ Clap Cletus showing the council he knows shit
[3:40:06] LogicWeasel: that won't work
[3:40:06] scallopppp: It should be like a "job acceptance message" sent to the owners phone to allow the removal of the turbo
[3:40:08] Jeremyohno: It's way to fast
[3:40:09] m3lenny: @Lucid_Jaydee i think i understand it. but most ppl think rp is something like gta rp. they only understand what they see on twitch playing out.
[3:40:10] w111iam1: Yeah to fix cars
[3:40:11] PrettyKrazy: mhm stealing car internals should either become its whole other thing with car scrapping, or lock it down, all or nothing

[3:40:13] Braintew: @EsfandTV You could have an owner's code to remove the upgrade parts on personal vehicles.

[3:41:25] treynrek: Do turbos degrade?
[3:41:26] Astral_Rage: and they should be serialized
[3:41:27] scallopppp: It needs to be a an electronic state ID system that allows the owners to choose to remove it

[3:41:36] spicyville: pushing it off Classic
[3:41:39] Loco_Cubano: it simply should not be possible to steal the turbo that way. Hold up the mechanic.

[3:42:59] only_seth: lemme get that turbo cuh
[3:42:59] m3lenny: thats why i am saying that this is powergaming. cause powergaming means, min maxing, playing by the rules, but not focusing on roleplay, but more min maxing to work towards your goal. i am just lost that others use this word differently. its not possible to remove a turbo in 5seconds. thats why its powergaming and bad rp. just my opinion.

[3:55:52] ToyLetTreat: but i think i missed a shelf
[3:55:54] Shmoopee: he talked to Xavier I think
[3:55:54] 360ski: It is nor a plea of guilt or a plea of non guilt, hence no contest
[3:55:56] widbar: yo
[3:55:58] jules_infinity: AAAA If Cornwood has a million fans, then I am one of them. If Cornwood has ten fans, then I am one of them. If Cornwood has only one fan then that is me. If Cornwood has no fans, then that means I am no longer on earth. If the world is against Cornwood, then I am against the world. AAAA
[3:55:59] xJustn: @ToyLetTreat ICANT
[3:56:02] LogicWeasel: you plead no contest in exchange for leniency
[3:56:03] mork_gork: LUL
[3:56:04] Craxxbones: Esfand getting good with this law shit
[3:56:08] Shmoopee: and he didnt mention he had proof the perp was innocent.

[3:56:20] PohnJaulPones: dont take the bald mans fun
[3:56:22] ViscountRe: The issue was that he plead no contest but they said he couldn't, so he was coerced to accept a guilty plea.

[3:56:40] VincentsDeath: with no contest, you can change your mind later and fight the charge or pled guilty
[3:56:42] bobkatt: Does pulling any of the books out lead to a secret passageway?
[3:56:43] xplayer55555: like some places  in front of a shooting squad
[3:56:45] Recon_XoX: Duncaning
[3:56:48] kingcloudii: no contest is only for civil crimes
[3:56:50] ShazerGaming: no contest normally is used when you don't want to admit guilt. It's useful so the police don't use your crime against member of your group to prove their crime. it's like a halfway deal.

[3:57:15] Metal_Thrash: Duncaning
[3:57:15] Xierany: No contest is accepting the charges without admitting guilt, but forgoing a trial.

[4:02:55] benjono_c8: Such a crazy hypothetical lmao, would never happen
[4:03:03] Jimmy_Tha_Quad: Exactly
[4:03:07] CrystalDimension: @sabsab4 SURE, BUT CURRENT ONES AND THEIR WAYS OF RUNNING THING DO NOT WORK LUL YOU COUL DMAKE 5 CAPTAINS  OR LEUTENANTS THEN
[4:03:09] viralostrich: @Metal_Thrash this is the answer to all issues at this point
[4:03:11] Themessias1001: yeah why didn’t he plead not guilty then
[4:03:19] Sizzlaa: moon2HUH lost in thought
[4:03:20] Zolothan: they took his choice away
[4:03:21] LogicWeasel: they want a plea deal
[4:03:22] gimmedacheekz: ??
[4:03:26] BeauHundo: why didnt he plead not guilty
[4:03:26] LogicWeasel: is what they're doing
[4:03:26] Lateralus_85: this was an convo suited for Drake, why is Cornwood asking this guy?
[4:03:32] fishmeatx: GOOD FAITH IN PD LUL
[4:03:32] TheTyBear: @benjono_c8 People plead guilty under pressure in real life all the time
[4:03:33] gimmedacheekz: He should've said "Not guilty" then????
[4:03:33] Nidoe: no contest is guilty??
[4:03:33] MisterParry: no contest is basically a guilty plea in court
[4:03:37] StreamElements: Watch my latest video: Streamers aren't people. Confirmed - https://youtube.com/watch?v=oGT-Tv6Eivg
[4:03:40] skeletree420: And he was protecting someone
[4:03:41] Brakon: ppl in gtarp have no idea what it means so they say no contest
[4:03:41] stillbaALin: wasn't he also timed and fined for a charge that then wasnt on his profile @EsfandTV
[4:03:42] Zolothan: not directed to one or the other, but forced to not pick what he wanted
[4:03:42] Numtjok: This man is cooked KEKW
[4:03:43] HoneyBK: yeah that police officer needs to be dapped.
[4:03:44] Wintyer2: dont forget the charge was not place on file for the 20k charge
[4:03:45] panchoxidado: and the charge isnt even there
[4:03:46] docterstrange_: also the charges are missing on mdt right
[4:03:50] LogicWeasel: no contest is just an enhanced guilty plea which makes it easier on PD
[4:03:53] taraannee: well now u have the issue of the actual murderer walking around free of charge
[4:03:53] SarahFlare: not to mention the charge isn't even in the record but  he's still out of the money
[4:03:54] Nrthrnlight: not in his records
[4:03:54] Xierany: Shouldn't just consider, it is NOT guilty, just accepting the charges
[4:03:54] Sizzlaa: he wears cool suits, i like that kimeggMut
[4:03:55] TheGodmother: Hmm
[4:03:55] slomojosh: ON TOP OF THAT THE CHARGES ARENT THERE
[4:03:59] Jimmy_Tha_Quad: no contest is definitely guilty. You’re not contesting the charges.
[4:04:03] Lordrune13: @MisterParry there was no court case tho
[4:04:04] alexandrarose13: charges are also missing
[4:04:04] docterstrange_: also the charges are missing on mdt right @EsfandTV
[4:04:05] dudemanbroo: LOL flag it up the chain, so nothing will happen
[4:04:06] slomojosh: and he’s billed

[4:04:11] iAmGermy: Wokege
[4:04:11] FauxReal__: Wokege war
[4:04:13] MisterParry: @Nidoe it means "i am not contesting the charges" or, I'm not arguing with the charges
[4:04:13] HavenAU: If he said not guilty he would have to fight the charges and at that point he didnt know someone else had been caught who actually did it, so in his mind he cant get out of it
[4:04:13] emery_steele: local heli
[4:04:13] Sizzlaa: yyjFlower

[4:04:20] drakatsl13: monkaW
[4:04:20] DonnBeach: I thought it was you don't want to fight the charges but not admitting guilt
[4:04:20] Maz0hyst: Wokege Moon Fart RP going to far
[4:04:20] RTJ_Drops: isnt this the guy that repeats himself
[4:04:23] LogicWeasel: ask Crane what it means
[4:04:23] Syfther: Cornwood trauma
[4:04:24] theredfrosts: okay now picture this a man is chained to a mountain. up there for days and a gorilla is eating his foot…
[4:04:25] sabsab4: @CrystalDimension The problem is they are so worried the police will end up as a lawless force like last time, that they have gone too far the other way to make sure the police are criminals
[4:04:27] TheGodmother: PepeS
[4:04:30] Themessias1001: pleading guilty was a dumb ass choice by him he has nothing to argue anymore
[4:04:34] sabsab4: *aren't
[4:04:35] iiSMOrcMageii: no contest is accepting the punishment but not admitting guilt
[4:04:41] XRICyclone: its just alkida
[4:04:43] SarahFlare: but he's out 20k
[4:04:43] Sizzlaa: original sample esfandPls
[4:04:47] Jrey000: the otehr charges are there
[4:04:49] nivekalive: Scuff
[4:04:50] zanathorn: chat I missed the meeting, did the PD proposal pass?
[4:04:51] HoneyBK: wow that officer really messed up lmao
[4:04:51] LogicWeasel: and did jail time
[4:04:52] DonnBeach: "A no contest plea, also known as nolo contendere, is a criminal plea that does not admit guilt. It means that the defendant does not accept or deny responsibility for the charges, but agrees to accept the penalty. "
[4:04:52] MrFuniBones: No contest would've been implied as not guilty IF the PD had GOOD FAITH LUL
[4:04:52] temporal_archer: @iiSMOrcMageii mhm
[4:04:52] Loco_Cubano: but he went to jail didn't he?
[4:04:59] HavenAU: Literally -20k and no charge KEKW
[4:05:00] howyaben: pepeLaugh
[4:05:02] icephrogg: nekoda is being a snake right now with etta on the mayor lol
[4:05:02] Brandon_Trolik: hes gotta pay 40k then lol theyll process after
[4:05:02] fishmeatx: just fucking die IG
[4:05:03] Jimmy_Tha_Quad: Next time, see not guilty…
[4:05:05] pathasahat: he has to sue the pd
[4:05:06] RexPappa: Compensation and fire those guys
[4:05:06] sabsab4: One he plead guilty, he's guilty
[4:05:08] adaa12345678: PD failed him hard
[4:05:09] BeauHundo: why didnt he plead not guilty  󠀀
[4:05:10] Jimmy_Tha_Quad: say*
[4:05:15] nippynoodles: no contest is a thing, and a "mistake" like this is.....the case should be thrown out and he should be awarded money
[4:05:16] Sizzlaa: lol
[4:05:17] EpicOfGiggamesh: Sounds like perfect situation for mayoral pardon to me
[4:05:17] Atrix646: WhySoSerious
[4:05:19] XStempX: How was this?
[4:05:19] catfish_quackenbush: this is something you talk to the captains about
[4:05:20] fishmeatx: BUUUUT
[4:05:23] WayILive: then he just sues
[4:05:26] Maz0hyst: No contest is farting in a room and not admitting it was you but saying okay I'm fine with you thinking it's me NODDERS
[4:05:28] Xierany: @Themessias1001 Not if they didn't allow him to plead no contest. It's wrongful procedure from PD and could revert the charges
[4:05:29] yxng_paige: the other charges were there so doesn't that mean it was processed?
[4:05:29] Jimmy_Tha_Quad: You said he tried to plea no contest
[4:05:32] w111iam1: Hush money LUL
[4:05:33] Dandulf: Chief Cornwood will deal with this.
[4:05:33] Nickomongo: not on record but billed
[4:05:34] iiSMOrcMageii: @temporal_archer yeah so basically he should have served time and fine but not have the charges and gone to bench
[4:05:35] TheGodmother: hasSadge
[4:05:36] ComaToasted: Hmmmmm
[4:05:37] StreamElements: 22% OFF YOUR PURCHASE AT GAMERSUPPS.GG when you use code "OTK"! NOW UNTIL 2/9! GET ON NOW, GIT!
[4:05:37] wiltsne: so about talking with captains about it ?
[4:05:39] xJustn: and be out 20k Sadge
[4:05:40] seal_clubber39: who was the officer??
[4:05:40] thebigchinballs: Etta is besties with ruth it all makes sense now
[4:05:41] SZNProductions: -20k
[4:05:41] fishmeatx: @Maz0hyst THX
[4:05:41] OhMahGlee: there should be no risk
[4:05:43] JakeStratic: NEVER happened. You just said charged 20k.
[4:05:47] VincentsDeath: the think is, he was charged for everything BUT the murder charge (almost like it was removed)
[4:05:48] LuckyJamesNoSkill: 20k lol
[4:05:49] MrFuniBones: He tried to plead not guilty but they were scaring him with 20k hypothetical charges which was also not Good Faith
[4:05:51] JakeStratic: ugh, feel like so many don't listen
[4:05:51] ComaToasted: that's a good point
[4:05:52] god_awful_gamer: Siobhan is already cooking this with Cornwood, why drag someone else into this. It can lead to information getting out to people who he is going to sue.
[4:05:55] LogicWeasel: and went to jail
[4:05:55] Jrey000: @thebigchinballs ahhh ok LULW
[4:05:56] ZilzGaming: 20k charged though
[4:05:58] pr0digy_1: -20k and Time they were in prison for
[4:05:59] fishmeatx: yeesh thats days of work
[4:06:03] w111iam1: True better not to bring it up and get hit with it
[4:06:03] PrettyKrazy: cost of getting fucked????
[4:06:05] Doqx42: Would be coercion for guilty plea
[4:06:06] PrettyKrazy: why should he pay?
[4:06:07] fishmeatx: ??
[4:06:09] SeaOfEmpty: the 20k is less than an expungement
[4:06:11] taraannee: he'd still be charged a felony tho bc he did take & try to sell the corpse for like $100k LUL
[4:06:13] fishmeatx: IM CONFUZZLED
[4:06:15] b2a80: he already paid it
[4:06:15] nippynoodles: THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS?! an innocent person?!
[4:06:17] MrFuniBones: CORNMAN
[4:06:18] SaltiBanana: cant he counter sue for damages?
[4:06:20] PrettyKrazy: why make him pay if hes getting fucked in the first place what
[4:06:22] JasonVoorhees71: pepeSmoke
[4:06:23] Daxisshort: That is a dumb
[4:06:24] HelgaZilla: he's missing the point.. the guy is not guilty.. the officer is the wrong.
[4:06:26] nimbleop: No way he would havbe to pay again
[4:06:29] discrtidunkwn: NP 4.0 Roll with the punches lol
[4:06:32] fishmeatx: mhm soooo no DAP
[4:06:34] JakesGotMilk: From what I know pleading no contest essentially pleads guilty to the criminal charges but not to any civil liability related to the charges
[4:06:34] Atrix646: o wow this guy really
[4:06:37] max6speed: Gotta pay to be innocent WutFace
[4:06:40] HeyMeghan: yeah but they could already click processed on it at any time
[4:06:40] Rawhiders69: No daps?
[4:06:43] w111iam1: +10 DAPS
[4:06:44] Jerren: @b2a80 hes saying that the guy is "paying" 20k and the jail time to duck the charge on his record, where if he brings it up to contest it, they could just process the charge and add it to his record
[4:06:45] N_troduce: slacks will look into it
[4:06:48] nippynoodles: you're innocent and charged with a crime you didn't commit, but that's the price of doing business. wtf. seriously.
[4:06:49] iiSMOrcMageii: @PrettyKrazy even if they kept no contest, no contest is acception the conviction without admitting guilt to the crime. No Criminal record, but still takes the time and fine
[4:06:50] notlimah_: whos the oficer chat?
[4:06:50] XStempX: Who was the Officer that did this?
[4:06:52] PrettyKrazy: did he not get the explanation?
[4:06:52] cenamyen: He already paid/did the time. The only risk is having the felony on his record, no?
[4:06:52] wiltsne: ye, go talk with the cop
[4:06:54] carefreespreee: @N_troduce LUL
[4:06:56] MatStanton: mhm +10 DAPs?

[4:07:02] Jimmy_Tha_Quad: Who is the charging officer?
[4:07:03] emery_steele: just talk to slacks
[4:07:05] discrtidunkwn: @N_troduce Absolutely
[4:07:07] notlimah_: @Loco_Cubano ok
[4:07:07] stillbaALin: All the other charges are still there - just the Murder one with the opposing video evidence that went missing but he still got fined and timed for it
[4:07:07] sabsab4: @nippynoodles Once he plead guilty, he isn't innocent.  He should of went not guilty then
[4:07:07] TheGodmother: hasSadge
[4:07:08] Flamesbond007: Which officer was it
[4:07:08] Shmoopee: @notlimah_ Maple
[4:07:08] CrystalDimension: @sabsab4 Objective truth is, shit doesn't work and it needs changes. Current captains were not chosen by anyone. They were here since  the start of the server and are here to start things running. There are plenty talented officers now

[4:25:35] DanLGG: I agree. Because in rp Mr K should not have been searched while the ppl who should have been searched weren’t even detained on scene. PD did a horrible investigation because they already had their possession charge.

[4:56:59] LegendaryGancho: I don't think Cornwood wants to admit that Slacks is a bigger part of the problem then Cornwood thinks he is
[4:56:59] Architank: The jail needs to be moved to the city so visitors are more likely
[4:57:05] xJustn: a wholed
[4:57:06] Hypox1c: the mayor is currently colluding with a criminal as we speak

[4:57:31] SimplytheDest: Renegade do good Lawyer Cornwood is a good arc

[4:57:36] vasuba: @xJustn its a 3 minute drive. they dont need everything in the city
[4:57:37] Zolothan: I think slacks actually wants a vacation
[4:57:38] layla109: @msblackwiddow That's slacks. Tries to do everything himself but it's impossible. He needs to learn to delegate
[4:57:38] SurelyBaked: a city jail and a county jail would be kind of clutch
[4:57:39] Frostlogic: You probably shouldn't be talking to a witness...
[4:57:40] fishmeatx: cornwood should give slacks a swirlie LUL
[4:57:40] Dandulf: Or do they?

[4:57:55] Felrane: slacks is just doing all 3 captains job past 2 weeks so he get forgetful
[4:57:56] The_Fat_Jedi_: Slacks will be fine, once Ruth gets taken care of
[4:57:56] bbbrabbit123: No stop looking away Cornwood, Slacks vision never aligned with Slacks.
[4:57:57] thegoodfella07: but slacks isnt following through with it at all
[4:57:57] outlawpickle: but corn is a man of action, and what do slacks actions show?
[4:57:58] Gio_Dtavio: except hes a wall to talk to
[4:58:00] iwannanuhh: But he can be conflicted with his actions and how he goes about it.
[4:58:01] Hypox1c: the mayor is corupt
[4:58:01] panhever: @EsfandTV the difference is slacks is just all talk and Cornwood tries to actually ACT
[4:58:01] twilightbaseballscene: he’s all talk though he let’s so much slip through the cracks

[4:58:04] lgnashevich: Pog
[4:58:05] w111iam1: But he doesn’t actually put the ideas into action

[5:13:33] bbbrabbit123: If Cornwood is only an official senior officer he would have been the commissioner that's the only qualification he's missing.
