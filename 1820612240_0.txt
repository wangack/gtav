[1:48:21] dragsvo: you're ready to be at the highest level of fame in this server
[1:48:21] HilariousNefarious: I think once the server gets older it will be popping more, hopefully.
[1:48:26] billysquilly: You are a legend
[1:48:26] dragsvo: should be rolled with a crew
[1:48:32] g1ftm3ow: amiloComfy
[1:48:34] knowledge15: amiloFree
[1:48:45] Jenkumz: amiloL2 amiloL2 amiloL2 amiloL2 amiloL2
[1:48:54] knowledge15: Free D-train
[1:48:55] DeathToTheOpposition: is your character in prison?
[1:49:09] Em0tuz: crime doesnt pay?
[1:49:11] yung_hov_: Crime doesn’t pay
[1:49:11] dragsvo: your music group is similar to a crew though
[1:49:14] whyyougottabanme: Ignite has attracted a lot of big rp streamers though
[1:49:16] Em0tuz: haha
[1:49:39] icarpediemz: ande
[1:49:42] yung_hov_: Hahaha
[1:49:46] HilariousNefarious: One step forward two steps back. Haha
[1:49:47] yung_hov_: Real life
[1:49:50] arcos9000: does your jail time tick when your character is offline?
[1:49:54] dragsvo: its very gang orientated
[1:50:02] somber_01: @AndyMilonakis i'm at like over 300 months
[1:50:09] dragsvo: but your version of a gang could be your music label
[1:50:21] yung_hov_: Basically
[1:50:26] DeathToTheOpposition: how long is a month in game?
[1:50:39] kalash7it: the risk should be huge
[1:50:43] DaemonShake: What's good D-Train
[1:50:44] DeathToTheOpposition: <_<
[1:51:00] boliboliii: why are you in jail?
[1:51:02] Eadris_: They bust civs' balls too though,  pushing them to crime
[1:51:15] DeathToTheOpposition: looks like prison to me
[1:51:18] Jenkumz: fines are a bit outrageous especially when they give you a long sentence.
[1:51:21] DeathToTheOpposition: alcatraz
[1:51:23] Em0tuz: small crimes should be doable without to much hassle
[1:51:28] HilariousNefarious: Lol! How much did you get?
[1:51:29] arcos9000: they could also just place a lower cap on how many cops there are at any given time.
[1:51:48] audiyomind: 1985 value of money, but the risk is definitely lowered being able to reduce time with op cleaning tasks, just ruins the civ / legal biz aspect
[1:51:49] arcos9000: so cops have to decide what calls are worth the time
[1:51:57] g1ftm3ow: OuttaPocket
[1:52:23] DXREX1990: sounds like a one sided coin lol
[1:52:33] Merkery: What you in prison for?
[1:52:38] dragsvo: its a feature not a bug
[1:52:41] Jenkumz: being too fresh
[1:52:41] DeathToTheOpposition: this is one lonely prison
[1:52:45] Merkery: Waddup Andy
[1:52:47] Demic87: Lucas is reformed

[1:52:54] DeathToTheOpposition: where's the other inmates
[1:52:56] dragsvo: you could get people to get their hands dirty for you
[1:53:04] whyyougottabanme: 45 minutes a lot of time for a streamer lol. And then you gotta find a way to keep chat involved in the boring jailtime
[1:53:04] Merkery: @NARDCLOP amiloPlebheart amiloPlebheart amiloPlebheart
[1:53:07] nameisboris: doing Crime should be so worth it that it would be crazy not to do it
[1:53:16] g1ftm3ow: NOPERS
[1:53:31] yung_hov_: I’m not going to lie u out on the streets be hella funny 😂
[1:53:38] spamsandwich: @nardclop amiloHeyGuys
[1:53:46] KingTheTurtle: Crime should have a balanced risk vs reward
[1:53:49] g1ftm3ow: window cleaning is the best LOL
[1:53:50] Jenkumz: did you and frank ever get the orange creamsicle out of impound?
[1:53:59] nameisboris: considering the way it works now doesnt seem crazy to me but

[1:55:08] ReaperDaDemon: I applied but 4-6 weeks wait time sadge
[1:55:11] Merkery: Its like a love hate thing lol I love it until I hate it
[1:55:11] johnnycmd: Did you find dude that took your car
[1:55:12] dragsvo: its very economy driven
[1:55:22] darth1007: Ohh okay, you mean they need to match the high risk with a high reward
[1:55:30] lexdiam0nd: This is the perfect time to write another song or 2 that’s what all rappers do
[1:55:40] dragsvo: its cool that people value their money though
[1:55:45] dragsvo: unlimited money would be boring
[1:55:58] whyyougottabanme: Have you run into Captain Lionel Riggs yet? Lmao dudes a hilarious rper

[1:56:19] Merkery: its like you commit to a server than 6 months down the line the servers gone, also being in the UK the peak times seems to be when I have to be in bed
[1:56:26] vampireanarchy: omgchadHi what was the crime they got you in jail this time
[1:56:43] darth1007: Ur right Andy, crime will be more intriguing once the high risk matches a high reward
[1:56:52] KingTheTurtle: Kyle seems to keep shift 1 rockin' Kiwo is on shift 3 a lot too
[1:57:23] yung_hov_: Prison SUX don’t do crime kids…. Unless it’s video game 🎮
[1:57:38] 202mouse: mrccOhgod
[1:58:04] DeathToTheOpposition: that prison looks like the one from the movie hancock
[1:58:05] Number_201: Yeah, rub your butt on the tables, that'll show em
[1:58:08] whyyougottabanme: At that point there is really no incentive to do the crime lol
[1:58:23] illogicalinput: Less fines more Community Service.  lol
[1:58:24] LionSuit: are we sure all we get from store robberies is just money everytime ?
[1:58:24] yung_hov_: @whyyougottabanme nope
[1:58:27] LionSuit: kongfHmm
[1:58:32] yung_hov_: But it’s funny
[1:58:47] TMS_: crime should be rewarded more than? like in real life? Kappa
[1:58:47] 202mouse: that should make where u can spit on people...
[1:59:02] LionSuit: ahh yeah they should prob lower the fines for sure
[1:59:04] KingTheTurtle: Seems like construction is more worth it than petty crime from an outside perspective
[1:59:06] DeathToTheOpposition: @202mouse that's worse then getting punched
[1:59:16] darth1007: I think you might have the most hours streamed on ignite so far Andy lol
[1:59:20] 202mouse: @DeathToTheOpposition exactly...lol
[1:59:24] LionSuit: at least early on to incentivize crims. maybe after the server is extremely poppin they can bring up crim fines again
[1:59:32] vampireanarchy: Whole Foods is nice
[1:59:42] Merkery: Hows server queue/population size?

[2:05:07] billysquilly: But yeah you’re eating the sahara
[2:05:07] bringthatroleplay: so you save the salami for special occasions
[2:05:15] DeathToTheOpposition: i hate it when i'm eating food and it sucks all the moisture out of my mouth making it hard to eat the meal
[2:05:18] california_snow: Shamrock50
[2:05:23] icemooka: Can you jump over fence

[2:06:43] icemooka: Awwww
[2:06:49] arcos9000: @MDMums happens anywhere tourism becomes a big thing. you end up with a bunch of "must try" places that locals actually stay away from because all they serve is slop.
[2:06:51] vampireanarchy: Whole Foods delivery used to be great. It was free for prime members until people started using it a lot in 2020 and now Amazon charges an extra $10.
[2:06:55] icemooka: Mint tea guys 👍
