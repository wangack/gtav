[0:58:00] biggerb0at: @Samuraiyeti no no its just shitlording half the time rp
[0:58:24] griphen677: i like Mickey's outfit
[0:58:27] GrimmVex: Penta was complaining that they fought back and claimed "Bad RP" on the P&D guys.
[0:59:15] Samuraiyeti: in the trial of last night, that wasnt jordan, it was an streamer adding rp experience, not the character
[0:59:28] Chriis_0303: ohh is that like a enderchest? KEKW
[0:59:29] Tear223: @GrimmVex that's not really the entire story of what he said man...Let's not drama bait here
[1:00:22] haista3: it was about nvl since there were 7 cops there not about bad rp in context
[1:01:20] GrimmVex: @GrimmVex Fair enough, correction, those complain we for the two that pulled up and gunned Jordan down while surrounded by police.
[1:02:11] hecteye: Danger didnt get attempted murder at least
[1:03:05] Chriis_0303: KEKW YEA
[1:03:06] Dream_Daze: vehicles are people too

[1:04:04] biggerb0at: this does need a court case I can see it be a L for jordan
[1:04:20] Chriis_0303: i missed it, is sasp is like a jail warden or another department of police? adoreDerp

[1:06:04] Grothmar9: ?
[1:06:06] Ambi_Trigger: awooo
[1:06:26] haista3: cant defend your property
[1:06:30] Leon_Roseheart: what does that even mean? whats the point of the clause then?
[1:06:34] griphen677: so what you just have to stand there and let someone take your stuff?
[1:07:16] Dutch_Tuchd: def gotta take it to court and get a precedent set about that
[1:07:21] SoloDev26: doesnt it being your property then makes it self defense
[1:07:35] griphen677: "oh no, this guy got in my car and drove off, guess i have no legal standing"
[1:07:38] Salimufari: Wait.. If the vehicle he shot at was his property & he was trying to disable that vehicle to prevent the theft.
[1:08:02] Salimufari: Was he at risk of being run over in the getaway? That wouild then be self defense
[1:08:10] Tear223: @Salimufari he shot at the tow truck
[1:08:10] Dutch_Tuchd: As is you can only defend you or another person, but can't defend your property... insanity.
[1:08:11] packed_nicely: @salimufari I think it's that he shot the tow truck not his car
[1:08:26] Fox_Fawkes: yeah no legal protection for car theft seems kinda crazy
[1:08:38] Adacas10K: It was technically a Business event...
[1:08:42] Salimufari: So the car was being "repo'd" effectively or legit stolen?
[1:08:51] Grothmar9: Stolen
[1:09:07] lloggiczz: towed for illegal parking @salimufari
[1:09:39] SoloDev26: shaemus a real ride or die
[1:10:37] Salimufari: I find it odd he spells it Sheamus instead of Seamus but it's his name.
[1:10:44] Ambi_Trigger: Its my stuff i defend it
[1:10:54] Spikee439: Jordan Steele is innocent
[1:10:59] Salimufari: @lloggiczz That's what tickets are for.
[1:11:01] Spikee439: LUL
[1:11:10] Dutch_Tuchd: Gonna depend on what judge they get... If shit goes wonky like Steele's previous case with judges who shouldn't have been trying that kind of case. . . No way to say what way it'll go until they're in the courthouse.
[1:11:15] sobersteve: It's so crazy to hear your real voice versus faraday, great rp as always <3
[1:11:28] Salimufari: Repeat offenders maybe but a citation or impound order would be needed I thi nk
[1:11:42] Samuraiyeti: i mean.. the guy shoot a cop goes free, hit a person and walk away with his victim leave it around the city bleeding.. goes free, go and tow a car in an event without reason and maybe win the trial.. its dumb, i mean, lets just make my rules and break all rp structure fck everyone else
[1:12:00] Spikee439: open carry is allowed in certain situations?
[1:12:04] Ambi_Trigger: oh no its the law
[1:12:13] Ambi_Trigger: breaking the law

[1:14:08] Sadimere: @Dutch_Tuchd there were no rules that prevented those judges from taking that case it was a miscommunication
[1:14:10] Ambi_Trigger: SAVE HIS BAWLS
[1:15:20] Salimufari: He can plea guilty to one charge & not guilty to the one that gets the law changed.

[1:15:37] puptime: satori1LUL mystickPet maicaShy thesesHey ashewyCAT
[1:15:49] Dutch_Tuchd: @Sadimere Those judges are supposed to be involved in civil trial, taking a murder charge of a gov employee criminal case was well beyond their normal preview of what they should've been doing. It was a massive miscommunication.
[1:16:05] griphen677: hell yeah
[1:16:07] griphen677: lol
[1:16:11] Ambi_Trigger: TY texas
[1:16:32] Sadimere: incorrect I watched the ADA and the head judges say it was fine the next day @Dutch_Tuchd and that they did a good job
[1:17:07] griphen677: and this is obviously not Repo he owned the car
[1:17:18] Dutch_Tuchd: @Sadimere say that all you like, wouldn't fly outside Los Santos. It's lunacy.

[1:17:51] thehunter87265: I‚Äôm off to bed Momo gotta be up at 4am for work sending you so much love
[1:17:58] lloggiczz: what needs rewriting is the tow laws
[1:18:28] Leon_Roseheart: Its perfectly normal to have a little bit of a curce
[1:18:51] Dutch_Tuchd: @Sadimere still should've had to be that before the case, not from trying such a case as magistrates.
[1:18:51] griphen677: the law is written black and white, the practice of the law is anything but
[1:18:58] RoninJawn: It's worrisome because I have yet to see any judges to use this method to make set new presidents even though cops keep getting told to push charges for that purpose.

[1:27:30] TylerDrake1790: HUH ?
[1:27:55] Salimufari: My instinct is that moment to steal the car like that is clearly a planned & premeditated thing.
[1:28:05] Salimufari: Making a statement
[1:28:08] equationz4: isn‚Äôt this the tow driver that shot baker

[1:29:44] Ambi_Trigger: KEKW
[1:30:04] Salimufari: This aint right no matter how you balance it.
[1:30:16] Dutch_Tuchd: You should def put in your witness statement that the tow truck driver was committing theft. And insist the scene lead press those charges as well.
[1:30:45] Salimufari: Not being charged with Theft? That is the counter suit FR FR
[1:31:12] packed_nicely: This literally isn't even the first time he's done an unlawful tow he just also accompanies them with other more dangerous crimes so it gets overlooked in court
[1:31:15] Salimufari: Encourage Danger to press charges for the car theft then.
[1:31:30] Heavyfoot: you sit like a gremlin but it's kinda adorable
[1:31:40] BausSK: would th eimpound log have the tow evidence?
[1:31:41] bilbosaggins01: defending your property is a basic human right
[1:32:12] TylerDrake1790: @bilbosaggins01 by shooting them?
[1:32:17] Salimufari: If he isn't going to then he may have his own way to 'handle it'
[1:32:45] kairoshu777: Did the tow drive had any paper work showing he has the right  to tow the vehicle
[1:33:02] HelpfulNuisance: @TylerDrake1790 depends on the context but yes
[1:33:31] haista3: guilty until proven innocent
[1:33:35] Salimufari: @kairoshu777 The owner was on stage at the time & the stolen car was on display for a raffle. Tow just pulled up & stole it.
[1:33:56] griphen677: seems like people handling this dont really know what they are doing. two of the charges were dropped as well werent they?
[1:33:57] bilbosaggins01: @bilbosaggins01 no you give them a warning and if they dont leave its up to you how you deal with a trespasser
[1:33:59] Galileothe1: lazy asses leg0sMadge

[1:34:38] Ambi_Trigger: reeee
[1:34:41] kairoshu777: Ok, damn sounds like guilty on both sides
[1:34:45] griphen677: did they test for gsr?
[1:34:47] Dutch_Tuchd: Time to pull aside all the officers involved in this who have failed to properly process these people. Put that Sgt boot down on their throats.
[1:35:00] biggerb0at: yeah pd really needs to buff themselves
[1:35:04] griphen677: if they didnt then they cant prove he shot his gun lol
[1:35:08] Samuraiyeti: who was the sgt?
[1:35:11] Dutch_Tuchd: @griphen677 They do
[1:35:19] bilbosaggins01: @HelpfulNuisance if they steal your shit or try to attack you and steal your stuff
[1:35:24] HelpfulNuisance: @TylerDrake1790 if I refuse to give you my property and you try to take them with force its self defense
[1:35:41] Ambi_Trigger: all i know is bed in minecraft can explode so i stay away from them
[1:35:56] Salimufari: @griphen677 there were a LOT of witnesses so .. hard to refute that.
[1:36:14] TylerDrake1790: @HelpfulNuisance that doesnt give you the right to kill a person though
[1:36:20] lloggiczz: it's the tow laws that need rewriting because the way they are that was a totally valid tow
[1:37:04] Ambi_Trigger: LUL
[1:37:12] Heavyfoot: @Momo I'm heading to bed early, have a good stream adoreComfy
[1:37:21] Salimufari: @TylerDrake1790 unless there is an attempt on your life in the event. Then it's game on.
[1:37:22] lloggiczz: then why didn't he get charged with anything for it?
[1:37:23] biggerb0at: you wanna have that wrestlers song in your head?
[1:37:31] Dutch_Tuchd: Yeah, this is tow truck drivers behaving like they don't have to be in the right to do their job as they please.

[1:40:42] boomshaka4: Has mickey interacted with vigo yet? Lol
[1:40:47] Ambi_Trigger: TELL HIM
[1:40:50] Salimufari: @TylerDrake1790 If the driver is running over ppl then it is
[1:40:54] HelpfulNuisance: @TylerDrake1790 its between the two parties, some countries refuse you that right and call it a crime
[1:41:09] Dutch_Tuchd: yeah, way too many officers just skip processing steps to try and get back on the street.
[1:41:09] Salimufari: Vehicular manslaughter
[1:41:09] griphen677: there is no photo of a GSR test on Rick
[1:41:25] bilbosaggins01: if you have a wife and child on your property and theres a trespasser and a threat on your property you use lethal force no questions asked

[1:43:24] Dutch_Tuchd: When they're negligent about processing steps it's clear that they're negligent about other process steps. Bunch of these deputies might needa go back to cadet training.

[1:43:44] TylerDrake1790: @HelpfulNuisance i can sort of understand that, what i dont get is, the being able to kill someone that tries to kill you
[1:43:50] Salimufari: Who is that?
[1:43:52] TylerDrake1790: that sounds like some vigilante shit
[1:43:57] hecteye: Deputy Maverick i think?
[1:44:15] Sykum: my bad
[1:44:28] Grothmar9: @Sykum Na all good adoreThumbsUp
[1:44:40] HelpfulNuisance: @TylerDrake1790 dude, read what you wrote a few times

[1:45:08] Grothmar9: Best Sgt
[1:45:11] VigilSerus: swabbin the poopdeck
[1:45:17] Salimufari: & he just LEFT BROOMS EVERYWHERE
[1:45:17] TylerDrake1790: @HelpfulNuisance just cause someone tries to kill you doesnt give you the right to kill them, even in self defense
[1:45:20] Raiighn: The most literal sense of "Clean this shit up!"
[1:45:32] TylerDrake1790: you cant just eye for an eye everything
[1:45:49] Ambi_Trigger: Rabit
[1:45:55] Ambi_Trigger: RABBIT
[1:46:02] Salimufari: @TylerDrake1790 I don't know a culture in the world that isn't at least defenseible let alone legal.
[1:46:06] HelpfulNuisance: @TylerDrake1790 btw its not about ending their life, its about neutralizing them, if you cant then they end your life

[1:48:04] Raiighn: That shouldn't smell bad, something is wrong with that rabbit.
[1:48:05] Salimufari: As a game warden we can verify that a rabbit gonna poo.. That's one of the 2 or 3 things they do REAAALLY well.
[1:48:06] HelpfulNuisance: @TylerDrake1790 the eye for an eye is someone taking their life as revenge for taking yours
[1:48:06] Grothmar9: @TylerDrake1790 @Salimufari @HelpfulNuisance  Lets drop this topic or take it somewhere else. This is not relevant to stream

[4:02:12] Rockhound__97: OneKnight had a sim with alot of clubs Karaokee club, comedy club, a hotel 8 stores tall, jet sking, Jazz club  each with a sound lockoff.   I worked there as security lol

[4:02:30] CollectorRaven: cLEAR, BUT QUIET
[4:02:30] Ambi_Trigger: yes
[4:02:31] PSfanatic: Seems clear?
[4:02:32] Rockhound__97: clear
[4:02:33] Archaius: music, pretty clear
[4:02:34] Salimufari: a little sharp. low base
[4:02:34] Ambi_Trigger: very clear
[4:02:35] Dutch_Tuchd: crystal clear
[4:02:36] griphen677: gripheJam gripheJam gripheJam
[4:02:36] CANTON__: Yeah its clear
[4:02:37] Lord_Gaius: clear
[4:02:39] Salimufari: very clear
[4:02:46] senpai_gig: sounds clean
[4:02:54] Salimufari: If this is a monitor mix for your set that's perfect
[4:02:55] Dream_Daze: sounds good to me
[4:02:57] Salimufari: very clean
[4:02:59] Leon_Roseheart: It was the song, yeah. thats clean
[4:02:59] Archaius: its very clean yeah
[4:03:01] Archaius: sounds good
[4:03:01] Ambi_Trigger: yep
[4:03:02] bumpkin312: Clear and clean
[4:03:06] yong2sun: ye
[4:03:11] senpai_gig: shiny clean
[4:03:12] CANTON__: Can you play a part with bass?
[4:03:15] JoannaLeFae: How are you playing it?
[4:03:25] Salimufari: Yeah .. very crisp. Doubled up sounds good too tho
[4:03:27] PSfanatic: coxDance
[4:03:28] Ambi_Trigger: yep Û†ÄÄ
[4:03:32] Salimufari: the latency is very low.
[4:03:33] CANTON__: Last song sounded like it had a high-pass filter on
[4:03:36] Deadmund: stripDance stripDance stripDance stripDance
[4:03:36] Salimufari: so it sounds like reverb
[4:03:36] PSfanatic: The doubled up sounded good LUL
[4:03:37] Rockhound__97: @PSfanatic last time i went theere i was using Phoenix Hud
[4:03:40] dropthebeets: strykuJam strykuJam -hold on that double hit for a sec
[4:03:50] AllRanger: makes me feel stoned
[4:03:51] Dream_Daze: its interesting
[4:03:52] biggerb0at: somewhat
[4:03:53] Rare_Dorito: timmacDANCE timmacDANCE timmacDANCE
[4:03:55] Archaius: not all the time but the doubled up could be a cool effect when needed
[4:03:56] PSfanatic: stripDance
[4:04:02] Leon_Roseheart: Doubled gives it a weird tinny sound, its not bad, but i think the clear is better
[4:04:03] Salimufari: IF youi want it clear not doubled.. but it gives a reverb club vibe doubled.
[4:04:04] JoannaLeFae: Depends on the song 10/10 times
[4:04:06] Dream_Daze: i think it works for this song
[4:04:07] Flux_Exclusive: Honeslty doubled sound cooler
[4:04:07] senpai_gig: i am stoned so thats why i like it
[4:04:09] dropthebeets: maybe not play the whole song like that - maybe the drop?
[4:04:12] Rockhound__97: sounds solid and we can hear you as even sound
[4:04:18] Salimufari: HELLS NO.. full momo experience.
[4:04:20] PSfanatic: Switch between the two would be a cool effect if mixing live
[4:04:27] CANTON__: The bass sounds a bit low tbh, but maybe thats just me
[4:04:47] Salimufari: @PSfanatic That would be good if you timed it well for the musical  phrases
[4:04:54] trevorviper: hi momo
[4:05:03] Rockhound__97: i got 5.1 on surround with my 50 showing this all looks good and you and music sound great
[4:05:07] Salimufari: That should have bass but it feels .. very high trebble
[4:05:10] trevorviper: good
