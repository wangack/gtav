[0:50:19] santilloo88: GH 2
[0:50:20] ProphecyEU: I wouldn't be surprised if Harry's right. I think most of the mats are for the shop; and the rest maybe for private affairs. who knows though.
[0:50:20] MattarChawal: Surely has to be someeee sort of promotion at 200…right LUL LUL
[0:50:23] Moby1kanobee: @Contrail1 teddy

[0:50:32] Kaaylev: he might retire or slow down if nothing is at 200, Sadge
[0:50:32] GordoUK: sani might need a slight buff but it looks so hard to get that balance right
[0:50:33] FinnaCrow: go full mafia, charge every non-union sani crew 20% of mats for protection
[0:50:33] Nickknows: at 200 stars u unlock recycle gamba wheel
[0:50:35] 9Rux: @armedgolem01 don't set quality to auto

[0:50:58] Zayrow1: can't you just reduce the mats needed per parts
[0:50:58] livenotonevil_: should be able to chop cars down to basic mats like that
[0:50:59] Joe_Broo: Does anyone know generaly how much mechanics are making per repair?????
[0:50:59] DaHub: NODDERS
[0:50:59] mullybags: have you guys been getting any recyclable items?

[0:51:10] lilisongss: did they not think whole server had free work cars would take tons mats at start
[0:51:10] Silencerz45: but it becoming easier at 200 stars is fine @buddha
[0:51:13] Thunamin: Material Gamba Wheel
[0:51:14] tybeeboy31328: Rich af
[0:51:15] GordoUK: or repair shops charge more
[0:51:15] Fugeki: get dekar on the server to farm mats for 16 hours
[0:51:15] demaxium: 200 stars equal 10 mats per recycle boom. lol
[0:51:15] ragnarob_: Chat needs to learn the definition of "Game Design" before throwing out ideas to change the economy lol
[0:51:16] jujutoojuicy: or every 10 parts they make they get 1 free one?

[0:51:20] banning556: how much money you got rn
[0:51:21] freedropsonly: could help
[0:51:22] jasonarce: But demand only increase
[0:51:23] nixi992: or people stop smashing their vehicles so much KEKW
[0:51:23] itskvn__: How did Sionis get materials in 3.0? Also Sani?
[0:51:23] brando8655: yeah you’d have to lower materials per part
[0:51:24] eva_v99: how can a repair shop have such a high demand when nobody has personal cars yet
[0:51:24] Moose_Machine: only answer really is make parts less mats right?
[0:51:24] Degenerate: yeah that's the solution i think less parts per repair to reduce the cost of materials neede
[0:51:25] Teddsan: 10% less parts would be huge
[0:51:25] CrookedPengu: i think the sani mechanic itself needs a fun spin. Not the money it makes
[0:51:25] FIINNO_: i think it's good for rp that it is lacking materials
[0:51:27] nbd_casual: Make rusty a bit cheaper so ppl can still repair at a decent cost
[0:51:27] Contrail1: grubLmao
[0:51:27] negapanda12: more money for the jobs?
[0:51:27] Anpuu__: No dont do anything, eco will fix itself by having rusty as a backup
[0:51:28] juicexgx: yeah I would say making parts less mats instead of dog making mats easier to get
[0:51:28] Kako0404: there are many levers to pull. just have to pull the right one at the right time
[0:51:28] kngwaliid: chat whats his rep
[0:51:28] eyev: ya, if you increase mats you gotta increase decay or something else to offset the saturation
[0:51:29] Miksuuk: soes the ammount of materials you get scale with the stars/job rep?
[0:51:30] armedgolem01: @Sirlambsalot no
[0:51:30] EhBud: i think make repairs more even on the materials like so much steel and rubber makes it hard
[0:51:32] deathyzz07: Master Mechanics 100 REP says part cost less but it doesn' t work so
[0:51:32] illifis: If the Master Mechanic buff werent broken, the orders wouldnt be nearly as large
[0:51:32] Bl1ce_: just add the rust wheel so you can gamble scrap
[0:51:32] iKickMyself: less parts isnt a bad idea
[0:51:35] khaisays: Repairs less parts and potentially give it so earthwell gives like a slight bonus of mats when you signout of a job?
[0:51:35] juicexgx: mats should definitely be hard to get
[0:51:36] Void_Ling: Just wait for the Gun BP pepeLa
[0:51:36] PodPyroJack: @buddha unlock new zones at 100+ rep?
[0:51:36] GCLladd: less parts means less income for mechanic shops, which means less mat business
[0:51:37] Suleman_aftab: yall were slacking last night plus yall converted alot of recyclable to electronics to sell for more, which is fair but hurt mary orders
[0:51:37] Lorddarkwolf: @buddha being a master mechanic is supposed to make making parts cheaper but its broken and doesnt do anything getting max rep at mosleys
[0:51:37] nachokiller33: everyone is also making made pcs atm
[0:51:38] superfrostyy: less parts per rank seems like a decent change
[0:51:39] dahbuddha3: or chops give mats?
[0:51:39] izzywrotethis: so many work vehicles

[0:51:46] robot_no69: !dev
[0:51:47] SwaxwellSilver: make master mechanics harder but part by them last much longer ez
[0:51:47] Ark789: @AmineMLC I think that's a thing already tbh - still limited people willing to run trash all night
[0:51:48] MONK_43: higher Sani rep. ie. 200 rep = double the output
[0:51:49] Miiharbii: less parts but they will still charge the same so mechanics will get rich easy
[0:51:51] eljerble: Is the issue that everyone is able to make everything as long as they have blueprints?
[0:51:54] Contrail1: I like this economics content
[0:51:56] vgarcia93543: Maybe increase the part cost down the road when they have expensive cars. But for cheaper cars, maybe the parts are significantly less costly
[0:51:56] MkMarkou: If its this much of a slog already will it not just get worse as more things open up to be crafted
[0:51:57] aeonsxp: How does the NP team keep an eye on the economy? Is it an effort both IC and OOC?
[0:51:58] masonas: I think either less parts or make parts cost more so people would be more carufull with their cars
[0:52:01] CrookedPengu: @brostro93 this
[0:52:04] awesome_igor: maybe more concurrent jobs, sucks that it isnt worth it to build a big trash empire if effectively only 4-5 groups run in parallel
[0:52:04] DaMc21: might need to change how much mats are need to craft stuff instead so it takes a bit less as there was 1 tow truck that needed like a 100 parts to fix and thats draining the supply demanding more mats
[0:52:05] SinisterSam_: Are there ways to motivate sani workers with other incentives?
[0:52:05] DoubleARonV: this truck is not union colored. smh
[0:52:07] brictavis: Master mechanic blueprints are also still bugged I think
[0:52:08] brando8655: wait till guns can be crafted you guys will be in deep shit
[0:52:08] StreamElements: Please refrain from harassing other roleplayers, streamers and their chats.
[0:52:09] awannii: they should just prioritize high rep for job offerings
[0:52:10] Teddsan: if the material market is struggling this much wait till guns KEKW
[0:52:12] PodPyroJack: @eljerble it was changed couple days ago
[0:52:13] caldavas: do a like 10% change to not use parts
[0:52:14] clumsytom: lol everyone has an opinion on this
[0:52:14] Malllo: repairs need to be more expensive imho
[0:52:14] illifis: @brostro93 They should be able to craft parts with less mats.... but the buff is bugged
[0:52:15] M0MENT: Or open another Sanitation zone up north
[0:52:16] Degenerate: @GCLladd that's just for mechanic he's not talking about the other stuff that will need mats still
[0:52:16] jamalalimirza: there should be a mechanism for old part to be removed and sani worker could recycle them for mats
[0:52:17] MrFantasmo: sup buddha
[0:52:17] ryuudrg: making chepaer for them just make the scam worst KEKW
[0:52:17] seby_17_: the issue is the mat spread some mats are used more than others currently

[0:52:20] TabbyRoom72: if you think about it sani kinda controls the pace of progression with the pc stuff
[0:52:22] xMike6: Higher rep being more mats would help
[0:52:23] Yusuke429: double the matts you gain , there just needs to be enough for at least 3 or 4 shops. Lang's crew should get enough to give mats to mary , vinny, and nino .
[0:52:23] lazy_azn_man: Increase the number of recyclables you get depending on your rep.
[0:52:24] brando8655: guns and attachment
[0:52:24] CyanMig: there will be some darwinism of crafters too, everyone will start, and only some will stay
[0:52:26] kuaci1: maybe add more zone? @buddha

[0:52:30] GoingAlonee: stripping and shredding cars in the recycle should give more mats and sanitation too i think
