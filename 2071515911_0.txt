[4:04:14] toenipsbetripin: this pd is getting way to serious, a character like cornwood wont last. Its a no fun PD
[4:04:15] layla109: @iwannanuhh What does SOP mean? I think having three captains was supposed to be a sort of checks and balances with the daps system. I agree there Is some huge discrepancies. Like the consequences for cops being much worse than consequences for crims. I get accountability but PD Rn is in such a bad state. Less resources, funding, etc..
[4:04:15] dapyman: @chunkeemonkey4209 yes

[5:10:44] Neiara__: She‚Äôs said herself her character is power hungry no?

[5:10:53] science_envisions: YEP
[5:10:54] zy7yz: she was with cornwood who was sick yesterday
[5:10:55] cdarx2: but not slacks for constantly being on her side / backing her?
[5:10:55] eklu65: ruth honestly reminds me
[5:10:56] toenipsbetripin: One of her recent streams, her talking ooc seemed really sus not going to lie
[5:10:56] Zedowel: She is playing a neutral heel
[5:10:57] comato4st: @Neiara__ ya sure
[5:10:58] PappaMidNight: WAYTOODANK
[5:11:00] jacksmithcje: I do not want Cheevar to get hate but yeh it‚Äôs true and it sucks of it just is allowed
[5:11:00] Khaosshinobi: what if she has a redemption arc
[5:11:01] thxperiment: Good luck explaining that in rp
[5:11:01] kikisocial: the character seems okay, just needs a counterbalancing force
[5:11:01] Asura_Shini: I feel like she kind of accidently negatively impacted others RP
[5:11:02] fishmeatx: Good rp but not good for PD
[5:11:03] MrFuniBones: More like difference between Ruth and the whole PD man KEKW
[5:11:03] Sacredtenshi: Ruth needs to be fired
[5:11:03] deftcg: It's just her character arc
[5:11:04] Crazyoldfool: her RP over OOC mindset is pretty lame ngl
[5:11:06] quaylewastaken: wait till you see what she said this morning.... she was going off on slacks and turner
[5:11:07] joewelch29: @EsfandTV has she said anything about it OOC ?
[5:11:09] LoneSoldier021: no gamba prediction?
[5:11:10] woolfdesign: She could just [perma and make another character :D
[5:11:11] SpiritEX: 5daps per fired person pepeLaugh
[5:11:12] ItsSkaara: Im just worried there not being enough cops in the end
[5:11:13] nickdrawsstuff: I disagree that she has good rp --- I think she's good at what she rps, but the rp is awful because its 100% negativity
[5:11:13] Eraborea: esfandL
[5:11:13] Jrey000: yea she laugh at your stament IRL... but said Ruth in character will take you down which in my opinon is bad to have a character that is so serious @EsfandTV
[5:11:16] panhever: yep exactly what i said, Shes good roleplayer but the concept of Ruth is no longer good for PD
[5:11:16] mrbig_668: how many daps does slacks get foir not including that staement ?
[5:11:16] Luthercorpz: Problem is she'll be protected by all the Old HC now an they just blame everyone else for breakign up PD
[5:11:19] Ganelon: It's GTARP meets Real Life PD Simulator.. and it's not meshing even though the characters are all doing good.
[5:11:22] Jerti_: yeah when officers quit and others are fired it gets bad
[5:11:23] Map_Of_Your_Head: @quaylewastaken LUL wait what
[5:11:24] GlitchyGunZ: in POE terms She‚Äôs close to bricking her character @esfandtv üíÄ
[5:11:25] taraannee: ya and u dont have mg info but her character is purposefully gonig against turner at the least
[5:11:27] LogicWeasel: her being in leadership screws things up
[5:11:27] superbizarr0: YEP this is even a problem with hollywood movies if a really good actor plays a bad guy really well  for the OOC stuff
[5:11:29] LogicWeasel: too muchpower
[5:11:30] Neekapkilla: I think she was playing her character a way thinking maybe there would be some pushback on it, but she actually hasn't. Turner pushed back on her hard one time but Slacks then switched sides to Ruth
[5:11:33] droksid00: Just killer her off and bring in Bruth
[5:11:36] PicklemanJaro: that type of character shouldnt be in charge
[5:11:36] fishmeatx: good rp but yeah she needs to... chill
[5:11:37] Joongi_: Ruth stopped being fun long time ago tbh
[5:11:37] owlx7: Toxic shift 1 culture growing
[5:11:37] Fozy15: So let me ask you something.....was her character doing what her character ; does...., was this pre-planned? Like is whats going on now , was that her intention from day one?
[5:11:37] VeaZasT: its kinda like real life
[5:11:41] LogicWeasel: mhm  there's no Boss of ruth
[5:11:41] icesweats: huh
[5:11:41] vMooni: why was cornwood suspended?
[5:11:41] humanhere2: I think there would be less of a rift if Turner was able to be on (not saying he should have been on, completely understand his reason for not) ..
[5:11:41] el_jotaro_: i hope the person behind ruth is okay, like it is just an act and its never easy to play a vilian
[5:11:42] zy7yz: slacks being on the phone in court is disrespectful Susge
[5:11:43] memo__foo: who do you think is gonna win @esfandtv
[5:11:44] KEKW_Sadge: LUL
[5:11:44] daintedfairy13: go sit by Johnson
[5:11:45] verwindx: Ruth ReallyMad
[5:11:45] joewelch29: @EsfandTV has she spoke about it OOC at all ?
[5:11:46] Raja_Banhammer: carmine omE
[5:11:46] Leafyerick: @EsfandTV Ruth has leaked out of the PD and it's been affecting the server as a whole
[5:11:47] bromonga: you should play some fart sounds HAHAHA
[5:11:48] ShadyMashX: Both shift 1 captains andddd Ruth need to be looked at even if it's slightly
[5:11:48] randybobndyphone: YEAH TURNER BUT TURNER HASNT BEEN AROUNS
[5:11:50] PierogiWasTaken: BIG PAPA LMAO
[5:11:53] MrFuniBones: So it's like Ruth as a character has taken a weird turn and it's on a completely different path now?
[5:11:53] panhever: shes basically an influencer with bad ideals
[5:11:54] fishnchips333: @EsfandTV ruth isnt to blame alone though, had the other captains, slacks mainly did their job and didnt just defend the captains station, ruth wouldnt be as much of an issue. hes just as guilty of the state of things
[5:11:55] quaylewastaken: you should find some ruth clips from this morning
[5:11:55] jd2881: It doesn't even feel like it would be a fun character to play at all.
[5:11:56] Joongi_: LULW
[5:11:57] ShadyMashX: Shift 1 seniors *
[5:11:57] Quaggsly: BIG PAPA
[5:11:59] NasrulAshr: Carmine lmao
[5:11:59] roshamb09: Turner was important for Ruth's character I think, he's her big conflict
[5:12:00] the_main_burt: i think all that ruth AND slacks need is somebody higher in command to bounce off
[5:12:00] Pearso95: suspended??? clip???
[5:12:02] DrWetbone: if officers stuck up for one another as the captains do there wouldn‚Äôt be a problem
[5:12:02] imanors: Carmine charter is quality
[5:12:04] msamuelw: the courtroom looks nice
[5:12:06] RexPappa: Well if anything is indicative about the effects of that character, its the toxicity of shift 1. Where theyre more eager to punish colleagues instead of cirminals
[5:12:06] humanhere2: I wish you'd work shift one some time, just to see it a bit (not that I think you need to be on duty any more than you are lol)
[5:12:06] w111iam1: So your saying she has inserted her ideas into the captains and Nekoda
[5:12:07] exm_twitch: KRIZZ
[5:12:08] PeterPleb1992: Captains arent interested in a  content server, they want serious only lol
[5:12:09] unclepaIpatine: Turner was around today and last night
[5:12:10] quaylewastaken: turner was on this morning
[5:12:11] miketwng: I dont think its a misuse of rank. she played the AH too hard is all.
[5:12:11] Wiipotato: Ruth works if she came into the PD like 6 months from now. Not a good starter captain.
[5:12:11] Luthercorpz: It's bigger than Ruth now it's all the old command an cops agreeing with her as they call ppl "Doomers" It's spread to everyone
[5:12:12] Map_Of_Your_Head: jfc
[5:12:12] merrilljustice: she‚Äôs a well rounded colourful female character and it seems like it‚Äôs typical men not being able to deal with that
[5:12:13] Janman88: PD isnt ready for a char like ruth atm honestly
[5:12:13] mercs99: i think its created a ton of cool RP, but at some point it does need to be pulled back or it can dominate everything
[5:12:13] Kalious78: @esfandtv you realise that slacks and/or turner are agreeing with her behind doors in there meetings? It's not Ruth, it's just the way they want PD to be.
[5:12:13] comato4st: if it was rp shed be ruthless to shift 1 peeps and not have a bunch of cronies
[5:12:13] ek1cs: WutFace
[5:12:14] Fizban_The_Fabulous: She plays her character so well
[5:12:15] MrBASins: Adrew would be a good to run the PD as his a real cop
[5:12:15] Neekapkilla: @roshamb09 Yes this. Turner is the only one who pushed back on her
[5:12:16] destinygun: @EsfandTV I mean also Slack ignored Cornwood  Rhodes and flop want to hire ftos with alot of cadets
[5:12:18] Gachiguru: They have just focused on internal investigation over building out the PD
[5:12:19] CrutonArt: #RuthRunRampant
[5:12:21] jacksmithcje: she needs to slip up to allow someone bigger to go against her too for rp like when she called it her office the arc is there
[5:12:24] NasrulAshr: This is just my opinion, slacks is a weak captain too
[5:12:25] Eraborea: esfandL
[5:12:25] MrPRINCE______: essaying
[5:12:26] MacVane: All her seniors officers too
[5:12:27] Mic_Stargazer: pepeLaugh
[5:12:28] taraannee: its a shame turner cant be around bc turner was the one keeping ruth in check & slacks used to be more neutral than he is now
[5:12:29] pontifux: Ruth is a great character, but some characters don't work without someone to balance them
[5:12:30] zy7yz: thank god LUL
[5:12:31] chmod_R_777: yea, cops are already disliked.... no need to go out of your way to RP an asshole Captain
[5:12:31] superbizarr0: Prayge  Chief Soze
[5:12:32] SirThomasBuckets: slacks is complacent
[5:12:32] woolfdesign: Everyone is to blame. Mass perma.
[5:12:33] Gachiguru: They are so worried of 3.0 happening they are speedrunning 3.0
[5:12:33] DonnBeach: This lady sounds like that paralegal
[5:12:34] Aphotice: make it so that there is impact on the capt giving the dap each time they give one
[5:12:38] genesissukehiro: lol
[5:12:38] merrilljustice: oh I thought u were talking about Siobhan lol
[5:12:39] leviathan297: FeelsStrongMan Cadets already growing up
[5:12:40] TheKingOfWit: It is true that the captains are making all decisions together, so you can't just say ruth is doing all these things alone
[5:12:41] ForillChange: i just saw the cop vs acorn video.. the cop does a cornroll and then mag dumps into his own car after hearin a acorn fall onto it..
[5:12:42] woolfdesign: Youth pastor
[5:12:42] mizkifsrecedinghairline: Slacks is the lapdog and Ruth holds the leash.
[5:12:42] oklucasss: @EsfandTV turner was with flop last night and saying hes trying to be more active so hopefully that can help a little
[5:12:43] Faisallu: only good captain is turner
[5:12:43] sammelweis: is this not your paralegal? lol
[5:12:44] Big_Dave_420: she said ooc she's immersion over content. could be the issue?
[5:12:44] ScrapMetalDragon: thought this girl was just an aid lol
[5:12:45] medvedek07: DarkMode
[5:12:45] God_is_a_cat_girl: you need a Straight man not a strait jacket
[5:12:46] sssacrifixe: Im happy Ruth happend because Mr. K was doing almost no crime before getting raided now there is almost no sani people going around LUL
[5:12:46] samaelulu: YEP
[5:12:47] NasrulAshr: Yeah
[5:12:49] the_main_burt: @EsfandTV i think they just need someone higher up to bounce off honestly
[5:12:50] MrFuniBones: Yes
[5:12:51] Freddiepines: spineless PepoG
[5:12:51] Luthercorpz: The snake faction def won the propaganda war
[5:12:51] RexPappa: Absolutely
[5:12:51] TimmayHS: holy shit the PD is cooked in this case
[5:12:51] itsNudeGrandpa: Slacks is a fence sitter
[5:12:52] belgianswaffel: who is the persecutor ?
[5:12:52] cashcody69: yo can we gamba on this case?
[5:12:53] GlitchyGunZ: She is stuck with her choices she‚Äôs already made unless someone‚Äôs a higher up to reign her in @esfandtv imagine Cornwood becomes her superior KEK W
[5:12:53] humanhere2: Turner has a similar mindset.... but shift 3 doesn't follow it as strictly, largely because he hasn't been able to be activ.
[5:12:53] Septylo: Slacks as the character doesn't want to refute the others
[5:12:54] genesissukehiro: that means hes at fualt
[5:12:54] Revdudeson: Slacks is a Yes man
[5:12:56] PicklemanJaro: which is bad
[5:12:57] Aphotice: like each dap they give, they receive half a dap themselves
[5:12:57] ncs_310: the captain system would of worked but Turner being out messed it all up
[5:12:57] GrumpyFelo: soo... you are fired in other words? KEKW
[5:12:58] Panos_97: Turner is the only one that has ever stood up to Ruth so far
[5:12:58] LogicWeasel: Slacks is a bit of a bootlicker on authority
[5:12:59] kikisocial: that doesn't work under the current structure
[5:12:59] toenipsbetripin: yeah hes a yes man to everyone
[5:13:00] Leafyerick: @Gachiguru She's so preoccupied tried to get rid of all the 3.0 cops that she's 187ing the whole PD
[5:13:00] HavocusRex: hes just as bad tbh
[5:13:00] ItsMadKat: slacks is cornwood but HEAVILY by the book?
[5:13:00] panhever: ye therefore hes also the problem LUL
[5:13:02] Joongi_: He's a pawn xdd
[5:13:03] w111iam1: Slacks will never admit he‚Äôs wrong
[5:13:03] owlx7: Rather than his best friend CORNWOOD
[5:13:04] redmistintheair: SLACKS IS THE DOG AND RUTH HAS HIS LEASH
[5:13:04] MrFuniBones: What about Turner then @EsfandTV
[5:13:04] ImStuckInATreeDud: so a cuck PepoG
[5:13:04] Snackkbar: the biggest problem is the 60 days it takes for DAPs to fall off thats wild
[5:13:05] Jrey000: Slacks is a follower not a leader
[5:13:05] scottywsullivan: Your legal aid got promoted quick huh
[5:13:06] ArkVulcan: Cornwood's Cadet leading the case
[5:13:06] TankArcade: I like ruby she just funny
[5:13:07] KYslippy: slacks is a liberal puppy dog
[5:13:07] TheMah1337: isnt that cornwoods leagal aid
[5:13:08] younghof27: how come 3.0 seemed more fun? lol
[5:13:08] ens0mniac: at the end of the day Cornwood just wants people to be happy, and people weren't happy, and the captains weren't doing anything about it, and Cornwood did, but cornwood SBSd too hard sometimes and it burned him @EsfandTV
[5:13:08] panhever: only Turner is healthy captain for PD
[5:13:09] miketwng: sIacks wiII defend the other captains BECAUSE HE CHOSE THEM
[5:13:10] jacksmithcje: my issue is slacks and turner are both ignoring Beric flop McNulty and Yorks advice
[5:13:11] exm_twitch: Who placed ruth ahead of the pd ?
[5:13:11] cdarx2: thats a bad captain then ... you need people with different views/opinions, not 2 copies of 1 person
[5:13:12] kixxay: hes part of the problem as a whole then.
[5:13:12] owlx7: Rather than his best friend CORNWOOD D:
[5:13:12] Cunder: so his a product of teh problem
[5:13:12] CrutonArt: Slacks has no spine or opinion of his own then?
[5:13:12] GamerFixOfficial: HUH
[5:13:13] Thunderpint: God I miss Turner
[5:13:14] science_envisions: it's just that there is nobody to dicipline the captains for messing up but themselves
[5:13:14] fishnchips333: @EsfandTV yeah and i enjoy that character existing but he gets alot of excuses made for him by pd members
[5:13:14] eklu65: that has created an adversarial relationship with their officers.
[5:13:15] SarahFlare: yeah I THINK slacks wants to make it feel like leadership is unified and such, however  it just makes him look like a pushover
[5:13:16] MrPRINCE______: bad logic KEKW
[5:13:17] ncs_310: before Turner had to leave for a bit, he was starting to get skeptical at Ruth
[5:13:17] Sizzlaa: soofloCoffee howdy
[5:13:17] Diamondman121314: Yeah, he needs to show that the captains are together on everything. Any problems they have with each other are talked about in meetings with only themselves
[5:13:18] shmeeso: If that's right then those 3 characters can't be allowed to be on top of everything
[5:13:19] AngeloJulius: FeelsStrongMan
[5:13:20] NasrulAshr: Yes but main problem is he listen to problems but sweep it under the rags. But this is just my opinion lol
[5:13:20] the_anti_imperialist: he's a status quo captain
[5:13:20] destinygun: @EsfandTV Does that make him a good leader?
[5:13:22] Mic_Stargazer: objecting an opening statement lol
[5:13:22] verwindx: i object
[5:13:22] Kaztiell: watching Ruth stream and talk about stuff is so different from Cornwoods perspective of her @EsfandTV
[5:13:22] thxperiment: Turner got mad last night that flops feedback form was anonymous
[5:13:23] DarthRadonis: KEKW
[5:13:23] papaswisha: Who's the chief of police?
[5:13:24] Mallyraws: if his mind will never be changed so if the 2 want u out ur out?
[5:13:26] HavocusRex: the way he leaves officers out to dry isn‚Äôt much different
[5:13:26] Mathi85: objection: weird
[5:13:27] taraannee: yeah but turner may publicly do that, he absolutely calls her out in captain meetings. slacks has been siding with ruth 100% since turners been gone
[5:13:27] Triist0ne: object: fuck mhm
[5:13:28] bbfnotch: Ugh fuk
[5:13:28] phaden_: yeah but maybe his character needs to grow
[5:13:28] PacGamer: fuck LUL
[5:13:28] zy7yz: fuck D:
[5:13:29] heartsonlysoren: object for weird
[5:13:33] slick_47: great lawyer
[5:13:33] Admiralnelsons: That voice NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[5:13:33] Hardpu: isn't it hypocrasy that Slacks doesn't want to see what you have on Ruth to dap her but will  go overboard to get you the 10th DAP?
[5:13:34] Brakon: isnt that bad for the review tho. cause that means ruth rules cause she always has as second vote
[5:13:34] DrWetbone: captains were appointed not elected and they didn‚Äôt work there way up like officers have to. they should have only been temporary
[5:13:35] weskerpalm: I don't think Ruth is that bad. I enjoy everyone's characters. /shrug
[5:13:35] Xierany: Did you hear Turner was on last night? So dope to see him back
[5:13:36] Mindhysteria: objection: fuck mhm
[5:13:37] Revdudeson: Turner frenn
[5:13:37] Joongi_: ??
[5:13:37] PacGamer: objection for fuck kekw
[5:13:37] ncs_310: o
[5:13:38] ImStuckInATreeDud: what
[5:13:38] w111iam1: OBJECTION!!
[5:13:39] sammelweis: object for drunken behavior?
[5:13:39] Slymask3: ??
[5:13:40] Techno_Plumber: Objection Weird!
[5:13:40] Joongi_: ???????
[5:13:41] Leafyerick: OBJECTION: WEIRD
[5:13:41] RexPappa: Also theres the issue that Slacks is the only mfer captain around, and I understand IRL stuff. But maybe hire another captain_
[5:13:42] Drexb: That's where the failure is, if Slacks wasn't just a yes man, the 3 captains should have balanced each other out
[5:13:42] ek1cs: HUH
[5:13:44] Raja_Banhammer: kind of defeats the point of 3 captains having to vote when 1 never pushes back on the others
[5:13:44] Sizzlaa: HUH
[5:13:44] verwindx: object for fuck: HUH
[5:13:46] Beep_Cx: Speak American, Esfand Stare
[5:13:46] porzingoats: WTF
[5:13:47] zilaprime: Objection for Weird
[5:13:47] Drunkenhunter2: from what i've seen it's like ruth is playing into the badguy role and never lifting her heel of ppl necks and it causes such a negative view of her
[5:13:47] Kaseyfullofjoy: lol the esfand mumble
[5:13:48] Eraborea: !watchtime
[5:13:48] DiamondBirch: HUH
[5:13:48] Kalious78: @esfandtv you realise that slacks and/or turner are agreeing with her behind doors in there meetings? It's not Ruth, it's just the way they want PD to be. It's too serious so people are scared of daps sure but it doesn't allow SBS like +1 for baaas
[5:13:49] Fozy15: The character of Slacks from my POV I would say would never DAP a cop unless someone higher than him told him to. He believes in people too much. He's 1000% just following orders.
[5:13:51] HardlyCamping: Ruth gunna suspend Saab next
[5:13:53] spicyville: it‚Äôs like they inadvertently got together two characters that combined is an abuse of power when, on their own, neither probably would
[5:13:55] Dicejr7: @EsfandTV If you could pick 1 person from PD to be your WoW guild leader who would it be?
[5:13:56] Sizzlaa: uhleeCantWatch
[5:13:56] panchoxidado: So, Slack treats the PD as a GANG. But they don't want the PD to become a GANG. KEK
[5:13:59] Janman88: if the three captain wanna play it how they do ANY form of oversight is needed @EsfandTV
[5:14:00] Freddiepines: She almost never streams, though
[5:14:00] DonnBeach: She has a very different perspective on rp and the server
[5:14:00] BrockLeeSwag: @Mindhysteria mhm
[5:14:02] Smoogol: Aware
[5:14:02] Oreo3295: a life? wtf is that
[5:14:04] Techno_Plumber: Chat on Discord?
[5:14:05] zilaprime: A life?! Whats that
[5:14:05] TheKingOfWit: her not streaming much also contributes to why people view her this way
[5:14:07] enfranchise_: She has a 3 year old yeah
[5:14:08] verwindx: wtf is a life
[5:14:09] Toluen090: Turner is strict but fair and not quick to dap but rather talk and point out things. He also gives the serious dad to keep people in line rather than just punish
[5:14:09] imataka12: pepeW Having a life
[5:14:11] Pandrax86: well she‚Äôs definitely been removing tags on reports.üòÇ she said she was
[5:14:11] RevMike: Wasn't she a paralegal. Is she allowed to be the prosecutor?
[5:14:11] the_main_burt: a life EW WTF
[5:14:11] Mic_Stargazer: normies ReallyMad
[5:14:11] ScyThE619: WTF why?
[5:14:12] CrutonArt: probably shouldnt be captain then
[5:14:12] miketwng: there is no chief - all captains are same rank but no check and balance
[5:14:12] PLK_: another life Aware
[5:14:13] Lyvione: well dont play the videogame like a captain then
[5:14:13] Apolloftw: Cletus should just run for Sheriff.
[5:14:13] Gachiguru: she shouldnt be high command if she cant commit.
[5:14:14] quaylewastaken: THIS MORNING WAS CRAZY BLAMING SLACKS AND TURNER FOR 2 N 3
[5:14:15] McKibbo: ruths leadership style it seems, its the leadership style where chain of command is absolute and rules and guidelines are law. Kind of like a dictatorship
[5:14:17] comato4st: so maybe she shouldnt be a captain
[5:14:17] itsNudeGrandpa: Imagine having a life when you could just play GTA RP Aware
[5:14:19] Snackkbar: They chose like the worst people to be captains time wise, Saab is the only one with a lot of free time to waste on RP
[5:14:20] Freddiepines: I always have to catch her on another POV
[5:14:21] LogicWeasel: @Gachiguru This 100%
[5:14:21] Sizzlaa: moon2HUH just like me
[5:14:22] Crazyoldfool: Ruth as a character is fine, but the way she and the other captains implement punishments is far too strict for the type of RP on this server.
[5:14:25] TewetersonOG: the thing is
[5:14:25] anthonytomb888: what time is the ff7 interview
[5:14:26] Clodhoppr: I think there needs to be clarity ooc
[5:14:26] Jrey000: I just think Ruth's character so far has just taken the life and fun out off PD
[5:14:27] Joongi_: YEP
[5:14:28] xJustn: YEP
[5:14:29] GlitchyGunZ: well, yeah, that makes logical sense. He‚Äôs married to the book. @esfandtv his hands are tied unless somebody is his superior COB could be the solution
[5:14:29] PacGamer: Yes
[5:14:30] the_main_burt: @Gachiguru +1 +1 +1 +1
[5:14:30] JTheHuntVal: I get a little annoyed that the only people you are allowed to complain to about a captain is a captain, but if you do so to slacks he does not respect that complaint. Who do you complain to then? Slacks literally forces the whole pd to bottle up all frustrations which is never good.
[5:14:31] Luthercorpz: It's to the point the poison has spread everywhere and the Snr's other cops are taking old school stances culture.
[5:14:31] MrFuniBones: True\
[5:14:31] LogicWeasel: YES
[5:14:31] Jayokuu: crane comes in and calls server health then its gg

[5:14:34] Zolothan: are stories ever planned ooc

[5:14:36] verwindx: OOOO
[5:14:37] SwitchBord001: She rarely streams as well. So that kind of has all of us in the dark.
[5:14:38] SpiritEX: omE  true
[5:14:39] KYslippy: having a life makes it worse. she just hops in and fucks things up and leaves
[5:14:39] fenrrs: they want a PD simulator, not RP it seems
[5:14:41] G3NER4LKD: damn already 5 hours in? good morning from Japan broüëç
[5:14:41] verwindx: ONE HOUR
[5:14:42] Sizzlaa: yugButt
[5:14:42] joewelch29: @EsfandTV the pd seems so serious compared to everything else

[5:14:43] thegummibearmassacre: FF7 Pog
[5:14:43] MrFuniBones: essaying Tweeting essaying Tweeting
[5:14:44] MrBASins: Adrew would be good to give the lspd an idea how it should work
[5:14:47] redmistintheair: THEN way would they pick someone who has lil time when they need someone who needs to be around alot
[5:14:47] ens0mniac: people still use twitter?
[5:14:48] humanhere2: Right, so perhaps Cornwood's perception might not see it all accurately.
[5:14:49] BigHeroSixy: Director interview? Pause
[5:14:49] kylemacs: THEY ARE SO SERIOUS @esfandtv
[5:14:50] superbizarr0: NODDERS  sometimes
[5:14:51] taraannee: its not even just that shes strict, bc if u havent watched u wouldnt know but she is doing shady shit
[5:14:51] exm_twitch: she is on an other vibe
[5:14:52] Dumboodaking: she doesn't care about content at all, she is about very serious RP  KEKW
[5:14:53] Joongi_: Crazy hoew literally everyone outside the PD has said something similar
[5:14:55] MakiWind: Captains are
[5:14:55] BaconHouseFive: The 3 captains names reflect their personality and Ruth is ruthless. Cheever is just playing the role they all agreed on
[5:14:55] redmistintheair: YES
[5:14:56] miketwng: Nah Turner is very UNLIKE Slacks
[5:14:57] MoohamedAlii: She doesn't see it as a content server @EsfandTV
[5:14:58] God_is_a_cat_girl: rigid PD when there's James Randal it's like, bruh
[5:15:00] ArdentCause: He is the model "captain" what you would read in a booklet when wanting to become a cop, the whole concept of the PD right now as far as the disciplinary points makes it feel toooo much like real life and not RP on a video game, its way to serious and unforgiving and it doesn't seem fun
[5:15:00] thegummibearmassacre: FF7 HandsUp
[5:15:01] finalfork: the dean killing thing right? @EsfandTV
[5:15:01] droksid00: but punishing you for your server 2 actions based on the rules of server 1 is silly
[5:15:01] Revdudeson: I think regardless of whether or not the captains want the PD to be RP'd that way. The general population does not. Because it causes a BUNCH of unneccesary drama
[5:15:05] TheyCallMePoki: The one time I watched Cheevers stream she was reviewing your Donald Bush situation and OOC she thought it was hilarious
[5:15:08] BlazeAndConfuse: there feels like a divide in the PD about how to RP
[5:15:08] Pandrax86: I think the issue is OOC, Cheever and Ssaab think the PD is doing fine and the devs are behind their RP.
[5:15:10] xJustn: some of the missions from devs and stuff come to mind
[5:15:10] AdmiralvSchneider: oh man she has u wrapped around her finder. the kids are fake, its a soundbord in the background Clueless
[5:15:11] nickdrawsstuff: To be fair, if you can't commit to the time it takes to be in high command, you shouldn't be in it --- You wouldn't lead a guild in WoW if you never had time to play.
[5:15:11] Braintew: Your new uniform was pre-planned wasn't it?
[5:15:13] mrcow53: @n0oxaskek after watching last night all 3 capts seem pretty ruthless
[5:15:14] Chadox6: wait how is that legal aid the lawyer?

[5:15:22] NasrulAshr: Who is the judge on this?
[5:15:24] Joongi_: EZ
[5:15:24] volicarebear: the way PD is currently, is like it's operating on a non "content" server
[5:15:25] ImStuckInATreeDud: doesnt he have a warrant

[5:16:43] yanni4100: in Pirates of the Carribean Will Turner vanished
[5:16:44] TwiggyMcgee: @EsfandTV do you think it would be a good idea to have different branches of PD but have them operate entirely seperatly different radio channel different command etc.
[5:16:44] PacGamer: I love Siobhan kekw

[5:17:02] Albiwar: ?
[5:17:05] Thraxton1: The focus on super serious RP in the PD does not in any way match the rest of the server, there's clown gangs, bobby charles and james randall and abdul always doing silly bullshit, and the PD is expected to meet that with "realistic" cop RP
[5:17:07] IIIIllIlll: Evilge

[5:17:30] Crazyoldfool: ultimately the issue is that the DAP system needs to be reworked. If people weren't afraid of getting kicked out of cop RP, they probably wouldn't have as many issues with Ruth.

[5:29:36] EPiQ: META: K pointed a gun at Jaeger and got shot before he could shoot. Mary+Jaeger's group scattered as cops arrived, K was found down with a weapon after frisk.
[5:29:39] RicoLoco52: K was shot. he and crew are convinced that johnson as first on scene should have noticed all the perps who left the scene via car as he showed up. they were pissed about it and yelling. which honestly was just causing confusion.
[5:29:39] KYslippy: chat?! where is clip of what happened that day?
[5:29:42] Metalcalfe: oh right
[5:29:45] Bundooa: And *HE* gets to be a lawyer? What a sick joke! I should've stopped him when I had the chance!
[5:29:45] a2th3vi: I think K has a good case
[5:29:49] ReneLorent: Hey sherrif, you good?
[5:29:51] Neekapkilla: Some one who watches every stream would have to fill in perfectly. But I think K was trying to rob Mary or her crew, but they shot him instead. Johnson came up and assumed it was Mr K and Ramee and Mary's crew ran away easily. Ruth ordered EMS to stop treating Mr K so he could be searched which then they found his gun
[5:29:52] BigHeroSixy: slowJAM
[5:29:53] joewelch29: @EsfandTV ruth stopped ems and searched k
[5:29:57] Toastedgamer03: it doesn't help that mary and co never got searched or gsr tested also
[5:29:58] Thraxton1: He wasnt' illegaly searched but that's what his defence claims
[5:30:00] iMoore_: who was in charge of shit scene for the pd??
[5:30:05] Clodhoppr: MrK also pointed his gun ‚Äúwhich was found‚Äù at Jagr
[5:30:06] Freddiepines: I was watching K's POV for the scene in question and Johnson's for the interaction with the fist fight a day or two later, shit was crazy
[5:30:09] Kalious78: No
[5:30:09] Clodhoppr: then Mary shot
[5:30:10] droksid00: OH I watched this happen! Was watching Slacks channel
[5:30:10] acm_509: That was the day K had a PD weapon
[5:30:11] TheMah1337: no
[5:30:12] Aphotice: they just rolled up to mushkins, held up yaeger, then the mosleys crew showed up orange hair dude started shooting and then left, k got shot, ramee pulled him out and then cops showed up
[5:30:16] Techno_Plumber: K got shot buy a gun
[5:30:18] Zedowel: Mr. K DID have a gun, but he was unlawfully searched.
[5:30:19] dudemanbroo: @EsfandTV mr k and ramee tried to kidnap viggors, got shot by someone in mary
[5:30:19] Leafyerick: @EsfandTV The issue was the Mr. K was GSR tested. He came back negative and then they searched him anyway
[5:30:19] Kaztiell: ye one guy on a bike reported it @EsfandTV
[5:30:20] heartsonlysoren: Someone wrote a report in white ink then exported to white paper
[5:30:20] SurelyBaked: Listening
[5:30:21] sammelweis: they fucked up on the report
[5:30:22] a2th3vi: no he didnt pull out a gun in this incident
[5:30:24] Marcobeste97: Not Jimmy, it couldn't have been out precious little Jimmy
[5:30:27] EPiQ: K initiated and lost, then they just gaslit PD that they were fully innocent and framed. There was a 911 report that someone in the car had a gun...and thats where K was found with a gun
[5:30:28] n0oxaskek: @Pee_aRe try some saltwater solution 1% and flush your nose with it. may do wonders
[5:30:28] wowdunni: Liberal slacks!
[5:30:29] Gachiguru: There was one witness on a bike that said K had a gun to Yeager
[5:30:31] ShadowedSeraphim: Mr. K was GSR negative too
[5:30:33] baller42o: Yeah but it was the people that fled the scene
[5:30:37] sabinstha1: When is Interview?
[5:30:37] iwannanuhh: That was after i think, at this point Mr K was a "Good Guy"
[5:30:39] TheMah1337: he did pull out a gun on yeager
[5:30:39] iJerrBear: righ tin front of Mary's house too
[5:30:39] GlitchyGunZ: Gregory thinks he got fired also because he knows the police didn‚Äôt follow SOP‚Äôs @esfandtv
[5:30:44] RexMophinos: there was a 911 call that "the guy in the red car has a gun"
[5:30:44] BigglesVII: When the reports get exported some of it changed to white font, it was there but no one could see it lol
[5:30:45] Kaztiell: @Leafyerick they always do that?

[7:42:14] eddym310: you sure?
[7:42:15] Basard21: johnson was the only one on scene at first and there was a downed individual so capts told him to stay with body instead of chasing the clusterfuck of people
[7:42:19] Hevs: so even if they prove he didnt need to be searched, it happened, i doubt the gun charge will get tossed. i just dont knowwhy they didnt go with the "they planted it" approach

[7:44:28] Vengy: TheVoices
[7:44:29] EPiQ: The thing about the GSR test and search is also that They loaded K up in the ambo while slacks was testing and frisking ramee...and called on radio to do the same to K not knowing he was in the ambo...so they pulled him from medical care to comply with slacks' order.

[7:48:22] greenburg22: gun planted is a great excuse
[7:48:25] xJustn: mhm
[7:48:32] EPiQ: You don't need to GSR someone to see if they have a gun in their waistband
[7:48:34] Dreamdreams7: Hmm is that so
[7:48:36] Gachiguru: NOPERS
[7:48:38] claptil: They also saw the people drive away
[7:48:41] Blizzard5050: Yup, there is reasonable doubt
[7:48:42] j0kezon: yessss
[7:48:42] Wintyer2: they did not GSR test or frisk everyone on scene only Ramme and MR k
[7:48:44] Boomling: next on GTA RP: no DAPs issued

[7:48:48] bertacharm: angy
[7:48:54] Kevz95: angy she-beast
[7:48:54] zac4e: bad scene handling NODDERS 1 DAP
[7:48:54] inducedcatharsis: OMEGALAUGHING Smoked Siobhan
[7:48:55] knuuuunt: BITCHED
[7:48:56] IzrevTheVirus: dna test would fight that argument about planting tho if dna was around at the tmie
[7:49:00] chickenwienersoup: and you get a dap and you get a dap and
[7:49:03] scotty2thotty18: GSR negative doesn't get rid of the possession charge
[7:49:03] Toastbane: @Wintyer2 Everyone else left the scene though didn't they
[7:49:06] TheSwunk: That's 5 daps for ruth NODDERS

[7:49:06] Exotic_Soul: that should be fine
[7:49:09] jacksmithcje: who handled that scene
[7:49:09] Joongi_: @s1cKNation Watch them just Bedge
[7:49:09] Xen_Crypt: It's bad police work in terms of scene control, maybe even some process, but none of that will overturn a possession charge
[7:49:11] blahder: The problem was that different officers dealt with ramee then g
[7:49:13] GoldBoxPlz: I don‚Äôt think Ruth lead that scene
[7:49:17] steven__99: if he was in the ambo, he was treated enough to transport
[7:49:23] greenburg22: ruth was senior on scene and they fucked it up entirely
[7:49:26] BigglesVII: @Xen_Crypt Yeah no one can deny it was piss poor
[7:49:28] spongefrank: That was ruth and slacks?
[7:49:30] cdarx2: this has to be daps on ruth, slacks and viv
[7:49:33] Joongi_: Video evidence EZ
[7:49:33] sabinstha1: I think Ruth is captain because one female must be captain.
[7:49:34] taffletv: @EsfandTV Svensson that called in the Gun ... He pulled his statement as well... So you can assume he may have been lieing.
[7:49:36] EPiQ: IMO, the charges should stand against K...BUT they have grounds for a civil lawsuit against the PD for improper care. The improper care doesn't invalidate the posession charge
[7:49:37] Amuze586: It's a fuckup to not search before but it's probably the right call.
[7:49:40] jacksmithcje: not Ruth messing up sure it won‚Äôt come up again though
[7:49:47] chickenwienersoup: doesn't matter if it's your fault if in charge on scene you are responsible
[7:49:47] kiolkjm: corwood needs sustenance
[7:49:47] Wintyer2: @Toastbane the witness of the gun brandishing was not searched and GSR and the officer said they were on scene
[7:49:49] battlemasterd20: what side are you rooting for? im rooting for mr. k
[7:49:50] rodolfo872: The thing is, K sayin he was being kidnapped, while he was down at the drivers seat, makes no sense, and then if he is lyin about the kidnap, the planting a pd gun theory goes down too
[7:49:55] zac4e: The silverlining if Mr K is found not guilty, is that Ruth is that much closer to get fired
[7:49:57] Exotic_Soul: yes
[7:49:58] Mindhysteria: yes
[7:49:59] taffletv: @EsfandTV yes
[7:50:00] Kevz95: YEP

[7:50:05] TristanLFG: Stopping the ambulance is a risk to Mr. Ks Life @EsfandTV he could get a reimbursement from that
[7:50:06] battlemasterd20: Ruth wouldnt show either
[7:50:13] hydr4d: Esfand how was your gastrointestinal vacuation today? esfandOkay
[7:50:16] sk8rkungfu: and where is Ruth
[7:50:17] TristanLFG: maybe
[7:50:17] Toastbane: @Wintyer2 If I remember that, he was on his bike and just said it and drove off before they could
[7:50:19] Sir_Tootsie: YEP
[7:50:19] spongefrank: Ruth need to be dapped
[7:50:20] lostmindoce: Exactly.
[7:50:21] Auhreliam: @EsfandTV Is Svensson a Swedish player? In that case it's 4 in the morning so maybe he's just not online
[7:50:22] Gachiguru: its not gonna matter
[7:50:23] HjFUN: no face no case
[7:50:24] steven__99: @battlemasterd20 she would never be able to show up, thats just life
[7:50:25] Toastedgamer03: the fall of the lspd o7
[7:50:26] blackmar14: thats always gonna be the case for PD
[7:50:27] dudemanbroo: @EsfandTV he would perjure himself in the testimony knowing how
[7:50:27] sirnigelthornberry: @sk8rkungfu being useless somewhere lol
[7:50:29] suzzanne___: all the police are policing
[7:50:31] s0ggybreads: like how ruth isnt here for a scene she was part of

[7:50:36] sabinstha1: Slacks fight8jh aloneü§£ü§£ü§£
[7:50:37] Aphotice: i think k was just upset cuz he was gsr negative with a gun, yet there was shots fired and no police went further trying to find the actual shooter
[7:50:41] neft39157: that makes it more better on K's if the one who called isn't testifying
[7:50:43] chickenwienersoup: is a no show a dap?
[7:50:44] suzzanne___: what is happening
[7:50:45] zac4e: @Auhreliam Oh shit, it is 4 am
[7:50:46] bertacharm: i was gionna say you could argue reckless endangerment pulling him out
[7:50:47] Toastedgamer03: @Aphotice and pulled out of the ambulance
[7:50:51] TristanLFG: true
[7:50:52] Connorbrow: I think McNaughty is the only officer I've seen with okay scene control. There really needs to be PD wide training to get everyone on the same page
[7:50:52] jacksmithcje: I‚Äôm sure by the end of this Ruth scene lead will make slacks agree he should dap himself and move on
[7:50:53] suzzanne___: cornwood still not a cop
[7:50:56] Wintyer2: @Toastbane thats not what the officer testifyed to and if the other was stated in testimony thats even worse
[7:51:09] spongefrank: build the file for ruth's daps
[7:51:11] suzzanne___: :0
[7:51:13] Cuuley: What's Mr. K's current warrant for?
[7:51:14] WanderSky: Where are the DAP for this?

[7:51:15] Joongi_: WutFace
[7:51:22] greenburg22: based
[7:51:23] BlazeAndConfuse: @Connorbrow Turner has really good scene control
[7:51:26] Firehead94: PD got shots reported call, johnson was at dicklovers, slacks calls it as mary's house, 4 cops call 76, Johnson pulls up just as yeager drives off, marys car takes off, ramee tells johnson that fury shot them (ramee hits whisper key by accident probably, johnson could hardly hear him), fury tells other PD that red car has gun and lets fury go.
[7:51:28] Auhreliam: It's a clout arrest
[7:51:28] jacksmithcje: slacks about to dap himself on Ruth‚Äôs suggestion
[7:51:30] restless_prince: this is insane LMAO

[7:51:33] LogicWeasel: WeirdDude
[7:51:34] EPiQ: I still dont think the claim it was planted can be proved. Possession is possession.
[7:51:35] Raja_Banhammer: esfandCOPS OBJECTION! WEIRD
[7:51:35] Jerti_: yeah this doesnt look so great for the PD
[7:51:37] Joongi_: GIGACHAD WEIRD
[7:51:37] cdarx2: the ambo angle is that PD kept saying it was for the safety of officers, however K was down/incap
[7:51:39] LogicWeasel: EZ
[7:51:39] dudemanbroo: he wont be found guilty lol
[7:51:39] Tenkaru: Ruth should get daps  for this

[7:51:54] lostmindoce: "weird" isnt an objectionable line of questioning LUL
[7:51:54] disruptedorder: if there was DNA back then it would have been different, cause you could prove he was the only DNA on the gun.
[7:51:55] Rastafiki: hes guilty but they had no reason to search him imo
[7:51:57] Mindhysteria: LOL
[7:51:57] AnusReaktorMan: Ruth should get daps  for this
[7:51:57] Antdavs24: theyre just not proving it correctly
[7:51:57] Jeps__: I dont see how you can prove it was planted
[7:51:58] Djfsappy: I mean he is 100% guilty  , just can't be proved

[7:52:30] complexlalo: smh slacks needs to learn from cornwood lmao
[7:52:31] woodywood_wood: not with evidence tho
[7:52:33] Rastafiki: as soon as he was GSR negative, there was no reason for a search. hes down and not a threat.
[7:52:35] matanzlatan2000: @Toastbane it is
[7:52:35] Gachiguru: And the timeline of him being pulled out of the car and put back in the car doesnt make sense
[7:52:36] zac4e: Would be hard to prove NODDERS
[7:52:39] greenburg22: RUTH WAS ON SCENE
[7:52:40] Thebreadlord: didn‚Äôt Cornwood use Objection Weird back in the day?
[7:52:40] jacksmithcje: this was Ruth‚Äôs scene therefore she can still rap slacks for this
