[7:16:11] Tzazi: gun mysteriously washed ashore PEPW
[7:16:14] SQArgus: I believe Prayge
[7:16:15] Archaius: the only plausible reason for the truck to be towed is that the PD called em, so that means they prob have the phone
[7:16:16] exhume125: Do they still have the towtruck? Having one without the other doesnt look good if they didnt take pics
[7:16:16] taeped: Witnesses on scene at court house can place biggs inside the tow truck though :(
[7:16:18] JessK08: he stole the tow truck cause you refused to pay fines.
[7:16:20] KillerBanshee: @Gbutters19 no

[7:16:57] omniplex924: If all they're going off of is witness testimony
[7:17:00] granddemon: Well at least they'll only hold you in the cells for an hour before the trial
[7:17:03] nixtres: do they even have evidence
