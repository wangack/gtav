[2:57:58] uborapnik: In British slang, "neek" is a derogatory term used to describe someone who is perceived as nerdy, socially awkward, or uncool. It's often used to mock someone who is seen as unattractive or lacking in social skills. It's similar to terms like "geek" or "nerd" but carries a more negative connotation.

[4:05:04] XPixelartX: Blood sugar big C
[4:05:06] HavocusRex: there's also a lot of people involved and they haven't all heard the story, hence repetition
[4:05:07] CopperKat: I don't think any auditor has spoken to Alice Watson which is crazy because after Aldo was prommoted she is probably the only truly neutral view of how that reivew panel went down @esfandtv
[4:05:07] StormiNyan: this is an interesting conversation and its SO important NODDERS
[4:05:08] madhatterui: I like using Duncaning when duncans around not for yapping

So this is important, he's being allowed to say exactly what he wants, as much as he wants, to people who are listening and can enact change. This conversation is important and needed and should take as long as it has to

[4:12:50] driver1036: Witness or evidence tampering?
[4:12:51] nasarat_blast: Fired or demoted
[4:12:51] Furrnox: Xavier is doing a good job just you wait. :) @EsfandTV
[4:12:51] hangloose2: esfandTV
[4:12:53] SarahFlare: unless slacks remembers what turner and ruth discussed in the hallway
[4:12:53] mrcringeking: @EsfandTV i wish they found the music video you sent to slacks on his phone and you would have to ex plane your singing hobby
[4:12:54] wafiy637: y not
[4:12:55] PlurpleLoard: with siobahn def gonna be negligence at least
[4:12:55] GhostSkull0: @esfandtv you think she‚Äôs gonna get demoted
[4:12:56] Peltzi: What would you like Cornwoods next arc to be?
[4:12:56] MattadinGaming: Banned?
[4:12:57] TheKill3rMast4r: I don't a single word
[4:12:57] Rawhiders69: I am glad youre a cop. Cornwoods cop chases are very fun to watch CORNMAN
[4:12:57] kCblol: she's gone
[4:12:58] cashcody69: if turner says what ruth said in private she will
[4:13:00] Banana_Pizza_Enjoyer: all ruth needs is a felony
[4:13:02] BlazeAndConfuse: she'll get hit with the cover up
[4:13:05] Liamav: you dont want him going down with the ship
[4:13:05] Brakon: the captains as 1 thing actually created the problem.
[4:13:05] ben_v_art: CORNMAN
[4:13:05] DevilDogTash: lawyer was 100% better
[4:13:05] iwannanuhh: I wish all the captains would get demoted... they just have caused such a mess
[4:13:06] slatt5: can we still GDKP on nopixel
[4:13:06] WayneG947: Cant let him dive on that grenade, save him from Ruth
[4:13:06] NoblestSteed: @EsfandTV Lawyer arc was fantastic because I feel it really made Cornwood and Xavier a solid duo that will persist well passed this whole saga.
[4:13:07] sodrdie: Slacks is such a liar, he has lied to Cornwood many times too
[4:13:08] TheKill3rMast4r: Understand
[4:13:08] Snackkbar: I think Ruth and Turner would 100000% if Slacks would tell them what they said to eachother outside of the mayors meeting
[4:13:08] finalfork: ruth needs academy again
[4:13:08] Edward_Theodore: if shes not fired she should at least be demoted
[4:13:13] nasarat_blast: Except the whole murder charge
[4:13:14] kylef_: frenn slacks
[4:13:14] GremLynneXO: CORNMAN
[4:13:15] Mitzukaze: and Max :P
[4:13:15] itsRickus: Her not granting a safety patrol after the meeting for Shiv is interesting though.
[4:13:15] Silvertap: More or less right
[4:13:17] ColbaeTV: Yeah she might get in trouble for denying security detail to Siobhan, or for evidence tampering for deleting the announcement about her treason allegations
[4:13:19] diguinnn: blind follow is dangerous
[4:13:20] SaltiBanana: imo he is a doormat
[4:13:23] TheKill3rMast4r: I'm not
[4:13:24] DonSequitur: pepeLaugh
[4:13:24] Gank4CE1: @EsfandTV depends on if they get her phone logs. who knows
[4:13:25] Scully_18: He has bad info to go off
[4:13:25] StormiNyan: NODDERS
[4:13:25] hannah_grace0823: would lawyer cornwood be a more permanent thing later on?
[4:13:27] jschrage10: she will most likely be demoted
[4:13:27] shanbananas: chat clip?
[4:13:31] Hodapp_: I really dont think he did have your back. Other then the shitty vote they had. I feel the opposite.
[4:13:32] redmistintheair: @finalfork RYTH NEEDS TO BE GONE
[4:13:36] nasarat_blast: Fired
[4:13:36] TheKill3rMast4r: Keep
[4:13:37] blanket4u: he seemed real neutral
[4:13:40] mizzikk2401: I agree
[4:13:40] Diamondman121314: ü§ù Server
[4:13:40] bepbup: YEP
[4:13:41] Meditati0n: And stalking you while off duty
[4:13:42] driver1036: Did Slacks drop the murder investigation??
[4:13:44] Shonuff_: Hmm
[4:13:46] TheKill3rMast4r: No I'm not
[4:13:46] TheBull14597: the captains really giving off "Divided we stand, united we fall"
[4:13:47] ColbaeTV: he pulled up my user card imNOTcrying
[4:13:47] Meditati0n: With aziz and den
[4:13:47] WayneG947: Spying on officers private convos also
[4:13:48] 69nooel69: uuu
[4:13:48] ncs_310: what‚Äôs the denying Siobhan protection punishment tho?
[4:13:51] SarahFlare: do we have concrete proof she was deleting the blain county tags?
[4:13:53] DL577: evidence tampering, yes she will
[4:13:53] Snackkbar: What about the tags on the reports being deleted was that her?
[4:13:54] mitchj2024: yeah she‚Äôll skip treason but get brought up on something else for sure
[4:13:55] Banana_Pizza_Enjoyer: just one single felony and ruth is ruined without the majors need xdd
[4:13:55] iJerrBear: it would've been leading
[4:13:56] HavocusRex: what if what she said before and after the meeting come out?
[4:13:57] MrFuniBones: Slacks is always gonna have Cornball's back tbh so not to waorry there ig
[4:13:57] b2a80: Did she delete it after being made aware of an investigation?
[4:14:02] imSteffin: you don't wanna puppeteer him danse
[4:14:02] lawlkat: getting fired
[4:14:04] warmonger210: Moon on Max has talked about it being conspiracy of treason as well
[4:14:05] sweetiepie2487: ColbaeTV you're famous PogU
[4:14:05] Edward_Theodore: btw what happened with the TAGS did you find out who was removing them????
[4:14:07] itsRickus: Eh it is
[4:14:07] Clear_96: @EsfandTV that way he also realizes. he had a come to jesus meeting with himself last night during that interview.
[4:14:07] MrSpiny: Slacks cant help but to -1000
[4:14:10] bepbup: Absolutely
[4:14:10] PacGamer: I will say I wish this wasn't so heavy on everyone shouting at each other. I hope the audit makes the changes happen.
[4:14:10] jester_joolz: JAIL
[4:14:11] cashcody69: after they walked out of the mayors offices ruth said to both captins about ignoring the mayors bill
[4:14:11] alohalegendzz: She would drag slacks down with her and he doesn‚Äôt see that
[4:14:11] ItsEdBoi_: Reckless endangerment
[4:14:11] crescenterra: complete lack of professionalism
[4:14:11] Thunderpint: Dereliction of duty
[4:14:11] hannah_grace0823: would lawyer cornwood be a more permanent thing later on?
[4:14:12] kointoss88: COULD be seen as that thought
[4:14:12] kCblol: next time Slacks won't have someone to catch that for him and he'll get caught up with her. There's multiple examples of treason from her and secondary charges. she's done
[4:14:13] ginger_james91: The only thing evil needs to succeed is for good men to do nothing
[4:14:13] ColbaeTV: @sweetiepie2487 FeelsStrongMan
[4:14:13] kitakiin: is there a way I could see what the announcement was? Is it on Youtube anywhere?
[4:14:13] innoshades: the treason charge won't stick but it completely magnified the leadership problems for everyone. Win for everyone but the captains.
[4:14:14] sodrdie: @EsfandTV  Slacks literally was trying to put a murder charge on Cornwood and lied many times
[4:14:14] humanhere2: Not sure that is evidence....
[4:14:15] MrNess47: fiduciary obligation
[4:14:15] lawlkat: i mean. it's endangerment for sure
[4:14:16] ZuldeadTV: if slacks or turner say something about her mentioning "not acknowledging" the law, she's probably getting treason. They won't tho
[4:14:16] TheKill3rMast4r: No I'm not your pouce
[4:14:16] gggetsniped: negligence?
[4:14:16] Kaseyfullofjoy: denying her punishment is a legal thing it shows she cant do her job she endangered her life
[4:14:16] Craze_Ewon: what annoucement was deleted?
[4:14:17] RhalArda: it could be grounds for the chief to fire her
[4:14:17] ichbindosgott: it does build suspicion about treason
[4:14:18] Parely: they denied Siobhan but gave security for Canter @EsfandTV
[4:14:18] mitchj2024: more conduct thing than law I guess
[4:14:18] MrFuniBones: Negligence? So lack of leadership responsibilities
[4:14:19] Furrnox: @EsfandTV It can be reckless endangerment
[4:14:20] Onionnade: DAP worthy at least
[4:14:20] Dicejr7: whole server is down?
[4:14:20] ColbaeTV: @sweetiepie2487 FeelsStrongMan calling my mom rn
[4:14:23] SereneDreams: I think she might get dinged for manipulating the chain of command for the Aldo thing, the person that happens to be at the review also happens to be who gets appointed by her @EsfandTV
[4:14:23] redmistintheair: @b2a80 she moved it someveryone cant see it
[4:14:23] d36i: (ooc) she would get treason only if slacks or turner confessed to hearing what she said in that stairwell clip
[4:14:24] GremLynneXO: angy +50 daps for not saving mrs dab
[4:14:25] quaylewastaken: THATS THE JOB OF A LAWYER
[4:14:25] SaltiBanana: its shows she makes leadership decisions based off emotions
[4:14:26] spicyville: absolutely 1000%
[4:14:28] iwannanuhh: We can recognize that he was dealt a bad hand but also made some poor leadership choices.
[4:14:28] everyone1980: shows incompetence
[4:14:28] crescenterra: at least this should result in her getting removed from HC
[4:14:30] soiledmypantss: Etta was granted it but not Sio
[4:14:33] sweetiepie2487: ColbaeTV she'll be so proud FeelsStrongMan
[4:14:34] PicklemanJaro: xavier is building a narrative
[4:14:34] HelveteTV: anyone got a timestamp?
[4:14:35] hoaphan88: Did Lang rage quit :v
[4:14:37] dapyman: Cornjesus
[4:14:38] Pheyond: at least 1 dap
[4:14:38] redmistintheair: was so good
[4:14:39] PatL25: what are your thoughts of turner changing his mind to terminate because of what slacks told him
[4:14:40] quaylewastaken: you can only not lead in court
[4:14:41] TheKill3rMast4r: I'm not your friend
[4:14:42] Connortation: @driver1036 slacks said the captains are no longer pushing it, but that doesnt mean someone else couldnt if they wanted to
[4:14:42] KNGRSM: It was great
[4:14:43] ncs_310: I feel like Ruth would definitely start a treason arc if removed from captain position LUL
[4:14:44] Gumpable: The entire treason investigation main goal is to bring ruths character into questsion
[4:14:44] snusge: Slacks dentt
[4:14:47] x_juiceman: He‚Äôs finally starting to realize there‚Äôs a lot he don‚Äôt know about the other captains
[4:14:48] Skycoh: wheres the interview? i missed it.
[4:14:48] Fatty_Tatties: I just really want to know why she is so focused on little texas to a point of guard dogging it to see who enters @EsfandTV I wouldn't think she wants to be Sherrif
[4:14:49] IIIIllIlll: mhm
[4:14:49] cashcody69: @d36i trueee
[4:14:49] Speeddevilx: rate my slacks ai voice i got bored @EsfandTV want me to make one for you? https://youtu.be/nzY-Im62U6Y

[4:14:55] DL577: mhm
[4:14:55] time4sleep: It was SUCH a good series of events last night 100%
[4:14:56] imtooepic7676: I watched 10 hours of the stream and passed out at the most important part lol. I dont know how you do it haha
[4:14:58] Snackkbar: He needs to report what Ruth AND Turner were saying after the Mayor meeting. That would be treason 100%
[4:15:00] b2a80: @redmistintheair but was it before or after she was made aware that they are investigating it?  Not really evidence tampering if nothing is yet being investigated.
[4:15:01] Joongi_: Wonder why xdd
[4:15:03] Elmond: play da video
[4:15:05] Banana_Pizza_Enjoyer: not granting it siobhan also makes the treason charge stronger
[4:15:06] djsweet2: What of Ruth  is behind all these attacks
[4:15:07] bepbup: @Gumpable Spot on, the charge is just to start that process
[4:15:07] ihhunt3r: hopefully now slacks sees CORNMAN as frenn
[4:15:08] PlurpleLoard: slacks needed to connect the dots himself to understand it
[4:15:08] IForgot2Prime: Sadge
[4:15:09] Dumpins1023: wonder why LUL
[4:15:09] dantezalive: hes dead
[4:15:10] elbinn: Cornwood has to be checked out because if he's cornwood he will get fired.
[4:15:10] biscuitz1776: Does anyone in game have the original announcement that was posted w/ Ruth comments at the bottom Cornwood saw?
[4:15:11] SavageTarzan: RIPBOZO
[4:15:13] mrburns40: I can see the final punishment to be Cornwood and Ruth having to do ride alongs together.
[4:15:14] CrutonArt: Cornwood is jaded
[4:15:14] TheKill3rMast4r: I'm not here for you
[4:15:15] lzrdwzrdtv: No balls

[4:15:20] w111iam1: Slacks is starting to believe
[4:15:24] ben_v_art: realized now maybe they aren't policing in the citys best interest but their own.

[4:15:54] CyniuThunder: @EsfandTV did Cornwood have a convo with Knight after that whole SHITSHOW besides a small exchange of words they had? Im not sure if I missed it or not esfandScoots
[4:15:55] Clear_96: @EsfandTV Laid the groundwork for him realizing the punishments Ruth enacted doesn't fit any of the actions of Cornwood, Aziz and Den Zel. Huge RP Moment and character developement for Saab's Character.
[4:15:56] PsychoJoker: Yeah spanish word for what basically , Que sounds like Kay

[4:16:25] sodrdie: Slacks has done nothing for Cornwood, you like him OOC, only Max had Cornwood's back,
[4:16:25] explodedrat: last night was story development
[4:16:26] IPZANG: @EsfandTV Iranian police here! How often do you eat mast o khiar? ;)

[4:16:39] Snackkbar: Maaaan Im just not smart enough to follow RP sometimes, you guys are too smart Sadge
[4:16:46] squirtlehermit: I think slacks's motivations have been good, but he hasn't understood the whole situation until recently
[4:16:47] Wild_Shiny_Absol: THIS
[4:16:48] accepted__: Did Cornwood get in trouble again ?
[4:16:49] madhatterui: if corn cud corn wood
[4:16:50] IllusiOGnarly: cause corn has TEGRIDY
[4:16:50] droksid00: Slacks doesn't operate that way. He is more do the right thing and everything falls into place
[4:16:52] DeathSequnce: @EsfandTV does cornwood see himself as sheriff?
[4:16:54] GremLynneXO: frenn the roof convo helped both corn and slacks a lot
[4:16:54] kCblol: i think slack was more trying to convince cornwood that he's being decieved, but then realizing that he might be the one that is decieved
[4:16:54] ragincyclone: There were times it felt like Slacks was trying to convince himself
[4:16:59] 1CaptainRedBeard1: How did Cornwood save Slacks last night? I missed the stream.
[4:16:59] CrystalDimension: @driver1036 It wasn't Slacks doing that. He wanted to ask a lawyer if there anything to pursue against cornwood because rest wanted to jusr fire him right there. He was hoping the "DA" will say there's nothing, so they won't fire him but just demote
[4:17:02] Navigator_Nav: I think this part is very fucking relevant in your testimony https://clips.twitch.tv/AggressiveNurturingSoybeanNomNom-ADg0OyqQMngEHHy3

[4:17:12] phswimmer: Leaking to the mayor means disbarment though
[4:17:12] ManakinEU: @sodrdie i think cornwood also like slack more because he is more on the fence than the others its a comparative thing i think
[4:17:15] Bigeyez: Chat Slacks legitimately likes Cornwood and thinks of him as a friend. Ssaab has said so many times

[5:53:37] MrDher: And durability is a problem
[5:53:37] genericusernameuno: You give crims the exact same cop car they get away with ease
[5:53:38] schmodan: they need dual miniguns

[8:37:20] Usahi_Light: @energizergeyser I'm 100% right, it was BOUGHT at a CORNER STORE by a PLAYER to DISTRIBUTE
[8:37:22] BaldPanda360: @EsfandTV Didnt you catch him distributing though?
[8:37:26] the_main_burt: make him think hes safe

[8:37:31] ParashootTV: But what if he moves his stuff in the meantime?
[8:37:33] dussssyy: what happen if no raid tho?
[8:37:34] Loc_On3: hit him with long cornwood of the law
[8:37:41] oofinside: mhm Û†ÄÄ
[8:37:48] mudamudaoraoraora: not sounding like cwood lol

[8:38:03] T0pher_C: idk it was so much of it, that it was prolly all of the supply he had
[8:38:08] nantredan: @Usahi_Light thats not how that works

[8:38:21] AFellowDegen: but he'll move his stuff
[8:38:22] Usahi_Light: @nantredan It does by how the law is.

[8:38:26] DrWetbone: have you checked on lovesick to see if he‚Äôs ok?

[8:39:55] gggetsniped: alcohol is a controlled subtance
[8:40:03] Strangemitts: especially a particularly illegal alcohol
[8:40:08] n0oxaskek: @Usahi_Light but there's legally distributed alcohol in stores and there is illegally distributed alcohol (moonshine)
[8:40:08] Lanineer: plus the ingredients & large amounts of washed cash
[8:40:08] LifeisPogChamp: you need a lisence to make alcohol irl
[8:40:09] KissItAndWink: ATF is different than the DEA
[8:40:09] Gachiguru: its illegal alcohol

[8:40:34] z_0_m: @Usahi_Light true, technically there are no licenses for alcohol as far as i know

[8:40:41] sokhh: ehehehe

[8:40:48] AngeloJulius: monkaS
[8:40:48] kCblol: calrify moonshine
[8:40:49] SchizoForever: esfandPls
[8:40:50] Usahi_Light: @Ahpotatoh and the judge will agree lol
[8:40:50] Supibot: @schizoforever made up their mind about going to bed: üõèüí§ (2m, 5s ago)
[8:40:55] n0oxaskek: @Usahi_Light yes it is a drug that is distributed in a controlled way. and not obeying that controlled way is illegal
[8:40:56] Skeletonrs: alcohol isnt a drug, but illegal alcohol is definitely a drug i.g non tax'd moonshine is a drug
[8:40:57] Zarroc: Clarify Moonshine
[8:40:57] duh333: specify moonshine
[8:41:00] Snaregods: alcohol is legal
[8:41:00] IllusiOGnarly: moonshine is dangerous its flammable
[8:41:00] LifeisPogChamp: moonshine is there?
[8:41:01] SarahFlare: moonshine is on there.
[8:41:03] Toastedgamer03: probably best to clarify it is moonshine
[8:41:04] dudemanbroo: say moonshine not alcohol
[8:41:05] Hotted89: Is this the day for laso?
[8:41:08] SarahFlare: moonshine was the third row
[8:41:08] Ahpotatoh: @Usahi_Light we shall see
[8:41:09] KhrisOsaurus: LULW
[8:41:09] SchizoForever: @supibot I don't think you can do that, but I think you should do it
[8:41:13] z_0_m: moonshine in the council meeting PepeLaugh
[8:41:17] grobb12: 1G
[8:41:19] Strangemitts: why are they just saying alcohol like its beer
[8:41:20] Bill_Collector: You would have to charge him with the drug possession charge for the intent to distribute charge to make sense
[8:41:23] Usahi_Light: @n0oxaskek Players run fake "bars" all the time and distribute alcohol, Cornwood WENT to one. The intent of the law is to apply to actual drugs
[8:41:23] vrenlin: sum1g
[8:41:29] T0pher_C: @Strangemitts cus it is
[8:41:38] T0pher_C: @Strangemitts alcohol
[8:41:40] purplegion: Time to set the standard
[8:41:40] Gachiguru: 9800 is nothing when a full run gives 20k LULE
[8:41:42] LordWalrusXV: Hmm
[8:41:43] the_main_burt: @Usahi_Light alcohol in stores is regulated by % in cornershops, usually not above 70 this is why moonshine is illegal because it can be above 70% leading to people consuming it having much wilder behaviour therefor it being illegal. i hope this helps
[8:41:44] droksid00: well you need to set the precedent
[8:41:45] Strangemitts: @T0pher_C moonshine isn't beer
[8:41:46] blahder: And you saw him distribute
[8:41:47] nalegi07: it is time to set some precedent NODDERS
[8:41:48] coppertec: SET PRESIDENCE
[8:41:48] b2a80: if anything, it will allow the DOJ to clear up the charge
[8:41:48] energizergeyser: @Strangemitts alcohol is a very broad description
[8:41:48] yassuomana1: Wait dt?
[8:41:49] chaosproductions: Let the judge figure it out

[8:42:00] JayMcMumbles: should be "illegal substances" not drugs

[8:42:06] DrCashew: In what world is alcohol not a drug?
[8:42:07] z_0_m: @the_main_burt real life laws dont apply to los santos
[8:42:09] dapyman: Time to set some precedence
[8:42:10] freddyvalens: trial, find out in RP :D
[8:42:12] WayILive: you WATCHED him distribute it

[8:42:17] Antaunik: I say send to docket, this is interesting
[8:42:17] b2a80: THis is something Wrangler would 100% push
[8:42:20] dudemanbroo: HE HAD CRATES AND BOTTLES
[8:42:21] inducedcatharsis: @Hotted89 It might still come up though
[8:42:22] kCblol: @inducedcatharsis max said 1-2 weeks for laso presentation
[8:42:23] Gachiguru: @PicklemanJaro thats just word on the street
[8:42:25] Kelborn: and you caught him in the act of distribution, he was literalyl selling it to someone
[8:42:26] oofinside: HUH
[8:42:26] Absoroot: @EsfandTV  You can probably argue how it's illegally produced and how it is a drug because it affects your body the same way drugs do.
[8:42:27] explodedrat: it could be‚Ä¶ first the case that build this new legislation in Los Santos legislature.
[8:42:28] KhrisOsaurus: BEND OVER HUH
[8:42:30] InsecureForSure: Ben Dover ?
[8:42:30] R0Rty_: @Usahi_Light okay but mechanics wise its treated just like marijuana. esepcially since you have to clean the money

[8:42:34] ChaseJake: huh
[8:42:36] PicklemanJaro: @Gachiguru Susge yeah....
[8:42:45] Strangemitts: @energizergeyser yea i know, but its moonshine. Which is actually illegal. Not like he was distributing vodka. It should be lumped in with controlled substances
[8:42:47] b2a80: Cornwood trying to Pump
[8:42:53] n0oxaskek: @Usahi_Light i agree on the intent of the law. nevertheless illegal distribution of a controlled substance could be considered illegal distribution.
[8:42:53] z_0_m: @the_main_burt right, but all that matters is what are the laws in los santos
[8:42:54] blanknothingblank: he also admitted under video tape that, thats what happened
[8:42:58] InsecureForSure: any Cactus Cooler enjoyers ?
[8:43:05] energizergeyser: @Strangemitts yea i understand what you mean, idk this will have to be discussed in court
[8:43:08] SkywalkerCush: 0 months $0 ICANT

[8:43:20] SarahFlare: it is
[8:43:21] the_main_burt: @z_0_m yeah you are right. and moonshine is illegal in los santos.  and cornerstore alcohol is not illegal. fact.
[8:43:30] Strangemitts: @energizergeyser yea true
[8:43:32] PGMuNrOe: If its not defined in the law you cannot charge them in court. A person can only be charged once a law is made and gazetted. If Moonshine is not defined then no beuno.
[8:43:33] Bill_Collector: Is moonshine a "controlled dangerous substance" yeah
[8:43:39] AFellowDegen: so moonshine is legal
[8:43:42] SarahFlare: look up controlled substance again
[8:43:44] IllusiOGnarly: no

[8:43:54] Khaosshinobi: look at the third one, you saw him do a handoff right
[8:43:55] IllusiOGnarly: it depends on alcohol content
[8:43:56] toph_er: Its a risk but i mean, if you win you have precedence that moonshine would be a drug
[8:43:58] CptTimberwolf: 9s Pause
[8:43:58] dapyman: 2nd prong
[8:43:59] energizergeyser: its definitely intent
[8:43:59] CygnusX406: BLANKIES
[8:44:01] Bill_Collector: Pushing drug charges on moonshine seems bad faith by the letter of the law
[8:44:01] SchizoForever: PogU
[8:44:02] gggetsniped: he has to be charged with felony intent to distribute first, read the first sentence
[8:44:02] PGMuNrOe: moonshine is technically legal untill the law catches up to define it as not
[8:44:03] ObsidinsOdysey: you cant charge somone for intent
[8:44:03] SchizoForever: I think he's a big guy
[8:44:07] gggetsniped: the two charges are tied together
[8:44:08] Kamdor: maybe speak to a judge?

[8:44:13] snowmannumbertwo: snowmannumbertwo subscribed with Prime. 
[8:44:14] Gachiguru: just intent to distribute not trafficking
[8:44:20] T0pher_C: @SchizoForever he didnt look fat to me
[8:44:21] Usahi_Light: @ObsidinsOdysey intent to distirbute is literally part of a law lol
[8:44:22] conorsbadfurday: I think let him go and charge later
[8:44:22] gggetsniped: @esfandtv read the first sentence of the drug trafficking charge, this and "
[8:44:28] n0oxaskek: controlled dangerous substance. it is drug traficking
[8:44:29] SchizoForever: @t0pher_c i like this one
[8:44:29] pinksparkly11: your going to the metting tonight ?
[8:44:29] HiggumsMC: The distribution on moonshine is technically not illegal just the possession is
[8:44:30] gggetsniped: "felony intent to distribute are tied together
[8:44:32] Codex88: its illegal
[8:44:32] IllusiOGnarly: if the alcohol is deadly then you could press
[8:44:34] JTB_099: what law says it illegal?
[8:44:35] dudemanbroo: THE KEY TO THE HOUSE
[8:44:36] droksid00: esfand plays this game 20 hours a day. you don't know more about it than him
[8:44:36] blahder: You don't need him for i
[8:44:38] JTB_099: does that law specify?
[8:44:38] vicrocity2009: i think you need to raid his ass
[8:44:40] humanhere2: Need a new law or adjusting existing law for felony with intent to distribute
[8:44:47] SchizoForever: I've never seen a case like this
[8:44:48] blahder: Let him go and figure it out later
[8:44:49] vicrocity2009: and build a trafficking case off what u find there
[8:44:49] T0pher_C: @SchizoForever lol
[8:44:51] Ahpotatoh: @Bill_Collector no its not bad faith, its a precident setting charge, that doesnt make it bad faith
[8:44:55] SchizoForever: @t0pher_c  "we
[8:44:58] R0Rty_: @JTB_099 the felony possesion law
[8:44:59] dapyman: The possession with intent to distribute is the easier to prove
[8:45:01] MalsieGalsie: was the warrant shut down by Slacks?
[8:45:03] Usahi_Light: Typically "moonshine" is only illegal because of the danger in distillation anyway, not because its a "drug"
[8:45:04] blahder: Him and his lawyer don't need to be here now
[8:45:08] SpikerzX: In manufacturing it also says distilled, meaning making?
[8:45:09] Sooparama: that happens with weed in spain
[8:45:18] energizergeyser: intent to distribute is WAY easier to push than trafficking
[8:45:19] time4sleep: @EsfandTV I would just go for possession, and wait for him to get caught again for pattern
[8:45:24] InsecureForSure: Hmm
[8:45:26] Mr_Birk: Could set future jurisprudence, got to bring it to court though
[8:45:28] gggetsniped: @EsfandTV in the first sentence of the "Drug trafficking" charge, it says it also requires "Felony intent to distribute"
[8:45:29] Dromaius_: Hi Dad!
[8:45:29] Bill_Collector: @ahpotatoh slippery slope. Makes sense to clarify with the doj
[8:45:30] garbss: CLASSIC L
[8:45:32] droksid00: @Usahi_Light alcohol is a "drug" illegal alcohol is an illegal "drug"
[8:45:33] Map_Of_Your_Head: no shit
[8:45:34] Wandering_Ranger: @SpikerzX manufacturing literally means production of
[8:45:35] humanhere2: They have creation, not distributing
[8:45:35] thornagin: just being in possession of these materials that are discarded by anyone I would think you couldn't be held accountable legally.
[8:45:36] alpine_ibex2: Set the precedent in court
[8:45:36] HarveyAndrews99: Just do what you can for now and raid him
[8:45:46] bigg504: slacks don‚Äôt even call you back
[8:45:47] unenders: @usahi_light dentt it most definitely is dangerous as fuck when you take one shot and get sent to the ER
[8:45:48] IllusiOGnarly: apply both delete later
[8:45:48] InsecureForSure: ahh tsss Push it...
[8:45:50] bygodwest: especially since they're literally labeled "marked for delivery"
[8:45:52] jointspecialist: do you raid is the question at hand
[8:45:54] BlueWhaleEVO: It would be interesting to see the courts interpretation on moonshine.
[8:45:56] SchizoForever: I just got here, what are you doing?
[8:45:57] blahder: If you're not going to push it now let him go and figure it out later
[8:46:05] blahder: He has been here forever
[8:46:11] Heaven_Expeller: manufacturing is too difficult to prove since no past record and no raid yet
[8:46:16] dudemanbroo: i am losing my mind you watched him sell it, its packaged in crates, he has thousands in illegal money on him.
[8:46:20] SereneDreams: Wait, was irl on fast forward just now? Why was he eating the chips so fast in the hallway
[8:46:23] HARD_DUB: im betting theyll find the still if they raid
[8:46:26] Ahpotatoh: @Bill_Collector pecident setting cases are not a slippery slope
[8:46:29] the_main_burt: to anybody struggling to see alcohol as a drug, i advise you to do a simple google search on the definition of drug
[8:46:30] Usahi_Light: @unenders The same can be said of homebrewing, you can get extremely ill via that as well b ut the reason it isn't illegal si because the danger during production is basically the same as boiling pasta
[8:46:33] z_0_m: @the_main_burt my bad i misinterpreted your original message. you were just trying to give some real life facts and thats cool
[8:46:36] Usahi_Light: a still though is basically a bomb

[8:47:02] usernamethatistosapproved: @kCblol, with that one i dont think so
[8:47:03] Bill_Collector: @ahpotatoh I'm saying claiming this as a precedence setting case is a slippery slope
[8:47:07] R0Rty_: @dudemanbroo they are being extra thorough because this is the first time doing this with moonshine.
[8:47:14] RoadwarriorTV: @the_main_burt alcohol isnt a drug and i can stop at any time
[8:47:21] IllusiOGnarly: and the knife
[8:47:22] General_Kumtash: raid before you let him go
[8:47:24] Wandering_Ranger: @Bill_Collector only a judge can decide precedence anyway
[8:47:32] JayMcMumbles: if hes let go ... no point in raiding he will clean it out
[8:47:34] jollypnda: @kCblol warrants can be extended with a judges approval
[8:47:35] lzrdwzrdtv: alcohol is a drug
[8:47:37] Dicejr7: mention the SIM card

[8:47:42] SchizoForever: card
[8:47:43] Usahi_Light: Alcohol is classified as a drug IRL normally, but if you apply that logic to Los Santos all the player run "bars" that all he cops go to should be sh ut down and charged as well
[8:47:45] droksid00: @RoadwarriorTV alcohol is honestly probably the worst drug because of it's availability
[8:47:47] the_main_burt: @RoadwarriorTV it is
[8:47:52] Khaosshinobi: something to bring up to max Evilge
[8:47:57] HiggumsMC: Bad news is he‚Äôs been stuck here for over an hour LUL
[8:47:57] General_Kumtash: hes gonna move it all if you dont raid before you let him go
[8:48:00] LoudPackNoReefa: ethanol is worse than most illicit drugs
[8:48:03] z_0_m: @the_main_burt appreciate it <3
[8:48:04] Wandering_Ranger: @Usahi_Light it's a legal drug, but still a drug
[8:48:09] Ahpotatoh: @Bill_Collector Is it not the largest bust of moonshine in the server? if thats not precedent idk what is
[8:48:12] w7AwfullySteezy: raid first?
[8:48:12] lzrdwzrdtv: @droksid00 its deadly too if ur very addicted
[8:48:21] dudemanbroo: @R0Rty_ they just gotta let it rip and go for it. a lot of the laws are vague to leave room for them to be argued in court.

[8:48:33] 1CaptainRedBeard1: This guy is great. If anyone interested he's TheDasTony
[8:48:34] kCblol: i just feel like in this city waiting is just a free pass. warrants always flop. charges never get pushed. this will be the end of the case
[8:48:36] Bill_Collector: @ahpotatoh it makes more sense to first ask the doj for guidance
[8:48:38] droksid00: @lzrdwzrdtv alcohol withdrawal is the worst withdrawal outside of heroin. and the only one potentially fatal.
