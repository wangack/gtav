[1:54:18] adzse: In an attempt to add as much authenticity as possible to a game set in a fictional criminal underworld, the producers of GTA V decided to shy away from “goofy LA actors,” and hired real-life gang members to voice background characters. Many who saw their scripts threw them on the floor, as they weren’t “real” enough, and they recorded their own version instead! dizzTHINK

[16:32:40] adzse: When Space Invaders was first released in 1978, it was rumored to have caused a shortage of 100-yen coins in Japan. While this was never proven, it wouldn’t surprise us at all, considering that in its first year, it grossed more than $600 million in Japan alone! By 1981, the instant classic had raked in $1 billion from players at arcades around the world! Also Space Invaders was the first video game to have a high score record! dizzTHINK
