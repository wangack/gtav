[4:02:12] rockereleven: ohhh that's Sadge. thx chat
[4:02:18] Sovereign_Doom: Nerdge so based on my math 2 cars is 700 jewlery which comes out to 7 runs with each getting 750 rolled, which comes out to 5250 dirty money. so grime if partnered with another member of the crew is more beneficial but solo makes more MathAintMathin
[4:02:26] falseff: This Packer is sexy
[4:03:01] LinksmutisLt: @Sovereign_Doom you forgor that it takes around 3 hours to go from choping 2 cars to actually having money in your hands and its not even clean
[4:03:03] iLLuSi0NN: @sovereign_doom u can get 1500 now for jewellry run they doubled it

[4:05:21] LinksmutisLt: @Sovereign_Doom also if you take into consideration last couple streams (I didnt see last night meeting, my bad, I will watch it later) Tony has been struggling to recoup dirty money from the bench
[4:05:21] despicablewebb: Sovereign_Doom plus you gotta factor in waiting time for nightfall nd the whole ass process of cleaning and selling jewellery where as grime has a 5 minute cool down and you make minimum 5600 with a partner (pounder) and 7600 with a partner (packer)
[4:05:26] Kadylol1254: how are you still awake????

[4:06:31] iLLuSi0NN: If you take someone for a run they should at least pay for repairs imo if you solo bought a truck
[4:06:35] quote_me_if_horsen: 8k a hour if you are a group that shares money is really really good
[4:06:54] despicablewebb: do it with a well known partner like geega and they will a throw in money mhm

[4:07:11] despicablewebb: Sovereign_Doom TRUEING money come and go my friend

[4:08:03] Khul_Sardaukar: all that washed $ should go towards packer imo
[4:08:04] Gotgold: it has the turbo
[4:08:04] Sovereign_Doom: @LinksmutisLt i mean if we're being really particular, i could also say that tony and said partner could both solo chop 2 cars a night and then this whole argument is blown up
