[1:54:27] somniquil: @1holydiver1 i think cause it's exactly 9000, it's a bit sus that the number is so clean, like 8870 or sth like that would look more normal
[1:55:06] b0rtjedb: @somniquil I think he just rounded it up because he loses money with using the VU lady
[1:55:08] SpilledNuts: Illya's done a great job taking over the weed crew honestly

[1:55:29] serendipity3456: winHa
[1:55:32] eazypzz: as long as its getting tracked, its all good
[1:55:52] SpilledNuts: 9000 is the exact amount at 18 which is the higher amount, so if he sold every bag at 18 then it's correct and if any bags sold at 17, then the crew gets extra money
[1:56:50] mrmajesticmajesty: He what HUH
