[4:18:05] rock99rock: It's a cell phone without voice, you just send numbers
[4:18:05] DubzMike: Early day caller ID
[4:18:06] taladien: hence why its called a Beeper
[4:18:07] masontheartist: basically they call a number, and it just is like a call log

[4:18:16] carisgypsy: later generation pagers could take text messages, but early just gave a number and you'd call them back from a land line
[4:18:19] DanneMM: It was very usefull because you didnt need much of a cellphone signal to actually get a message through
[4:18:19] stephenbrown1982: have you ever used a payphone on the street
