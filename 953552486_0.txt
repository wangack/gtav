[2:27:23] Kanejc0207: there is no health insurance. so like wouldn't you have to pay for a prescription
[2:27:28] sapeur: if he continues to buy at 200 and sell at 200 people will stop coming to the tavern
[2:27:37] Cidsvoid: prescriptions are not free.... there's no insurance in the city. its comes from his pocket. his is basically a none profit lol
[2:27:37] Brennanan: wholesale isn't exclusively reselling
[2:27:38] scarlet_symbiote: might be better that if drake wants to prescribe top shelf then he send his patients to the bar and he gets a kick back
[2:27:40] DonCig: in that case you are a supplier
[2:27:42] LijeBaley: But where is it all going though? Also that takes away business and money from the tavern uhnKek

[2:28:26] 3spada_Grande: Brew House
[2:28:27] 0xygenhomie: what if drake is able to reach people that would never come to the tavren otherwise. its like the tavren reached them itself

[2:28:38] RickyHavok: if he sells at 200 because he buys at 200 for wholesale he actively yoinks customers
[2:28:40] SealingAnt: just raise wholesale high enough to where he has to resell higher than the tavern if he wants to make profit
[2:28:41] dr_enthusiatick: Maybe they are just trying to recoup costs cause I don't think doctors get paid well
[2:28:44] HyenaDip: I like that

[2:28:51] Mexicanburrit0: Tavern becomes a real brewery arc
[2:29:00] TheRarePotato: I see the point but the competition shouldn't sell it for 200
[2:29:05] 3spada_Grande: Maybe with so many bars becoming a brewery is the move
[2:29:11] ItsNotAurora: or host attractions at the tavern.. ? that could reel people in I think
[2:29:13] ka1o5: Maybe HOA should just open a mechanic shop and get rich like the rest of the server
[2:29:13] Discontinuance: How do we turn Top Shelf into a pyramid scheme teenHMM
[2:29:15] LijeBaley: @eyeofthecuck Its on urban dictionary. Its like standing in a circle of people and shooting the shit
[2:29:15] lilylexie: If it’s only prescribed when people have treatment they are paying another $100 as well
[2:29:22] HelveticaStandardBold: hoa cumstacking

[2:29:29] FabFluffz: Once liquid Library opens up make it in house
[2:29:31] Atrofiya: drake is the alcohol speedy
[2:29:33] Pappa__Goose: I think as long as he just gives it to injured people and not anyone off the street I think that’s a win win. More people see top shelf and if they want more, they come to the tavern.
[2:29:34] PK132: He is making more money himself by doing wholesale the tarven isn’t making money at all
[2:29:35] clientnotfound: build client base and money and once LL opens up no more wholesale?
[2:29:37] EyeoftheCuck: @LijeBaley ohhh okay i gotcha thanks hahah
[2:29:37] 0xygenhomie: if the goal is that foot traffic needs to be in the tavren, then the situation has to change

[2:29:47] Ultimatestrife: what if people stop wanting to pay 300 here if they can get it cheaper at the hospital?
[2:29:48] Div_the_Penguin: regarding foot traffic why is there no Saint Patrick's Day promotion today
[2:29:50] 0xygenhomie: if the goal is money, kraytor is making it

[7:21:57] dejavureal: maybe Howler is just the name of the investigation
[7:21:59] DrakePoons: its a name for serial killer
[7:22:02] Zreaper_: Yeah, the Howler tag is purple because it is under Homicides

[7:22:27] Rionas: just a unique name to link similar incidents together

[7:22:38] DrakePoons: serial killer nickname
[7:22:41] ykicka: the Tags can be used to tie multiple reports / incidents together
[7:22:45] bluehairedboi: ohh an alia nice

[7:23:27] critikalhd: mdw is honestly pretty cool but it just sucks that theres so many bugs to work around
[7:23:29] ykicka: I think they're generally used for investigations rather than run of the mill stuff
[7:23:30] HyenaDip: Lauren would probably be the one to ask about it since that's like...her alley.
[7:23:31] xtrememayhem: barry looks like he wants to put his bandana back on lol
[7:23:31] Ashiri19: Forcer is the one who created this nickname I think @UberHaxorNova
[7:23:49] Tweker: the bandana just fits so well PepeHands
[7:23:52] HyenaDip: Forcer is just synonymous with serial killers now.
[7:24:03] ArJayHeart: so its easier to find reports, Forcer would usually go nuts trying to find stuff by her self before 3.0
[7:24:06] cvaga: A new animation for the MDW would be nice Like them lifting there heads looking around a lil bit
[7:24:15] ClottedCreamClaire: Holy fuck never realised the police stuff was so involved and in depth

[7:25:08] Purealistarbeef: @UberHaxorNova hey nova love your work bro
[7:25:08] duranggo: It was just as in depth, just a worse system made it all harder to keep track of @UberHaxorNova
[7:25:11] HyenaDip: I love that case laws are happening because of actual things in the city. it makes it feel a lot more lived in. but man does that suck for cops and and lawyers

[8:42:34] Thomarse: Ctrl + J is a good one
[8:42:35] FartFaxer: Shift + Windows + S allows you to select an area of your screen to capture an image
[8:42:39] Naixoram: default windows print screen and paste into Paint uhnOld

[8:43:08] Naixoram: KEKW
[8:43:09] AshesToAsh3s: Sharex is super modular, you can also set it up to "edit" after capture so you can crop in their editor before saving/uploading but its a bit more work to set that up
[8:43:12] NihilistPenguin: haha bayo just itching to get that dude
[8:43:14] KingPresiden: this fucking guy peepoSus
[8:43:14] HyenaDip: oh my god luke again?
