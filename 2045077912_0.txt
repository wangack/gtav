[0:12:21] xflame404: @Xpatrol 5 for gpu 2 for rack

[0:12:26] thebigheaded: anyone join hq?
[0:12:40] zvidrvhim: Tell dez to remove marty from the panel problem solved lmao
[0:12:51] reagon_plays: @ZvidRvhim Shush

[0:13:59] rybohh: you can use the pc if you’re on the security panel @mandypyro
[0:14:01] mortuusintus12: @mandypyro hes in the panel since he asked to fix the house haha
[0:14:03] Herccu: solved easily by buying butcoin from someone else
[0:14:03] randjjjj: @mandypyro yes, he was all over the pcs yesterday when marty was in the house LUL
[0:14:12] jinxedluck: are the racks currently working at all?
[0:14:21] rybohh: i don’t think marty would do it
[0:14:22] dexterpatrol: It is what it is
[0:14:31] mandypyro: prolly him then lol. he wanted 9k back
[0:14:38] mortuusintus12: @rybohh thecaraLUL
[0:14:46] hemmorj: @rybohh he the only one that really has access so its pretty Susge
[0:14:48] rybohh: honestly maybe there was a mining issue there was like a whole day last week where nobody mined anything
[0:14:51] xflame404: @rybohh why do u think so?
[0:14:51] 2soonTV: peepoShrug
[0:14:52] 4HeadsDustyGun: Did you add strain name?
[0:14:54] stocker218: Who would buy a bp n sell it n tell noone.. I guess
[0:14:59] Eatchy_: so .27 an hour
[0:15:04] anactualthug: Could it be from AK designating rooms in the house and making them render as you use the room to reduce lag make the miner not work while no one is around?
[0:15:24] StreamElements: If you have Amazon Prime you can connect your Twitch account and subscribe for free! Click this link for more info twitch.amazon.com/prime
[0:15:25] Xpatrol: @anactualthug he didnt touch the rack
[0:15:28] smythdog1: did someone do strain name and add bella? that would be 2 coin
[0:15:31] rybohh: marty tries to avoid conflict and i think 4H has keys to his place soo
[0:15:38] bigpune: anactualthug maybe
[0:15:39] Grizzalopa: @anactualthug It actually could be related to this
[0:15:46] juneOT: the racks are linked right?
[0:16:04] stocker218: Yer
[0:16:11] SkipiMeowtastic: for marty to risk you all for 2 butcoin and also 4hed has keys to his place where he had all his stuff ... but who knows
[0:16:17] mandypyro: Did ming check the hq app
[0:16:19] rybohh: @anactualthug i’m not sure bc i watch the company members a lot and they made rooms to fix lag and they still mine
[0:16:22] 4HeadsDustyGun: When you stash butcoin, does minerEXT value also go to wallet?
[0:16:42] MaymayMoy: mrbongM mrbongM mrbongM
[0:16:44] Grizzalopa: @rybohh The company don't have there server room "roomed"
[0:16:48] anactualthug: @rybohh Did they designate the server room or just their bedrooms?
[0:16:52] lukaheng: Is ming get kick from the company HQ app?
[0:16:57] Sylverphyre: Power or asset bills not paid?
[0:17:00] ErraProxy: Sweet ming is live
[0:17:04] JayLanderson: is Ming irl from eu?
[0:17:06] Grizzalopa: Making a room on the editor renders the room out, it's likely stopped because that
[0:17:06] killasmokr420: has anyone tried 2 use the locks from the court house on inside doors of houses if they would u could have ur pc locked in a room
[0:17:07] hemmorj: why would 4head take the buttcoin Dentge chat
[0:17:08] rybohh: @grizzalopa i’m pretty sure ray did it yesterday or day before
[0:17:09] YoungOllie: hi
[0:17:19] Grizzalopa: @rybohh He did not, it was only the rooms
[0:17:21] Veldrag: should get .26 an hour

[0:18:33] killing4pleasure: lebronJAM
[0:18:34] anactualthug: @i1_Ghost Yeah but if theyre not rendered in will they behave the same?
[0:18:41] hemmorj: OMEGADANCEBUTFAST  cop house
[0:18:52] rybohh: might be worth asking around to see if there’s been an issue with mining for the last few hours
[0:19:15] i1_Ghost: @anactualthug as long as its placed on server it should
[0:19:26] Grizzalopa: @anactualthug Miners that are rendered in mine every tick hence why offline still mines but segmenting rooms renders the room out
[0:19:34] JayLanderson: EZ song
[0:19:37] lukaheng: How ming can make another HQ account when hes still in the company HQ?
[0:19:44] FeelsOkayManViolinTime: monkaS

[2:14:07] gunblade00: Although some men may continue to grow in their 20s, most men's growth plates are closed by 21 years. Hence, it is unlikely for men to grow after 21 years, with some exceptions. In a healthy growth pattern, your bone increases in length due to the growth plates in the bone called epiphyses.

You have no idea how you're doing financially compared to anyone else. 6. College kids aren't as cool as you remember being when you were their age.   7. And teens straight up scare

[3:01:10] hiraethh27: @vewybig the period made it weird
[3:02:01] gunblade00: beautiful Meaning:beautiful. Bella is a feminine name of Latin, Spanish, and Italian origin. Translating to “beautiful,” this name is a wonderful way to celebrate baby's adorable charm. While it can be a cute shortened form of names like Isabella or Arabella, the name Bella makes for a wonderful name by itself.

[3:04:22] ValuableBoring: Does your pc have to be connected to WiFi?
[3:04:33] hemmorj: Meaning: The name Fiona means “fair” or “pale.” Gender: Fiona is typically a feminine name. Origin: It is the feminine variant of Fionn, the name of a central figure in Irish mythology. Aware
[3:04:50] hemmorj: fckin irish TrollDespair
[3:05:54] gunblade00: Fionn mac Cumhaill, often anglicized Finn McCool or MacCool, is a hero in Irish mythology, as well as in later Scottish and Manx folklore. He is the leader of the Fianna bands of young roving hunter-warriors, as well as being a seer and poet. He is said to have a magic thumb that bestows him with great wisdom
