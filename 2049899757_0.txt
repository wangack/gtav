[5:37:45] slimeforyou: yeah i saw the prime cut
[5:38:00] deriece404: any possible its bounce back ?
[5:38:07] reeshx: oh no Aware
[5:38:23] Tedium2: wasnt it just inflated cuz of covid though
[5:38:25] shattiiee: well its post covid so the entire tech industry is in somewhat of a recession
[5:38:40] kurofox1: !fact
[5:38:42] Fossabot: @kurofox1 The common idea that only 10% of the brain is used it not true as it is impossible to determine the actual percentage because of the complexity of the brain.
[5:39:26] deriece404: is it possible to know how they are profitable in the first place ?  like how they are fund and stuff
[5:39:26] unknown_weeblord: True
[5:39:37] deriece404: yes
[5:39:39] deriece404: e sport
[5:39:46] shattiiee: games are really high risk "investments" right now
[5:39:49] xziltch: wassup rpr
[5:40:09] deriece404: ah
[5:40:14] kizunaRin1020: Dota2 esport is on only up coz of OILers doing tours, valve removed DPC
[5:40:18] shattiiee: merch
[5:40:33] x3shiina: t1 is profitable no?
[5:40:38] reeshx: nocco Aware
[5:40:56] deriece404: so when it comes to signing a pro player, did they also look how they are appear as public figure also ?
[5:41:07] dot_ed: esport scene is nowhere close to being profitable, even in NA league scene they are trying to exit
[5:41:24] deriece404: ok
[5:41:31] „ÉÅ„É†„Éº„Åï„Çì: DSG?
[5:41:47] reeshx: lmao
[5:41:49] Tedium2: 100t?
[5:41:52] Tedium2: but it was cuz of the merch
[5:41:55] Tedium2: from what i heard
[5:41:59] SmolKavi: @„ÉÅ„É†„Éº„Åï„Çì Toast mentioned that he lost alot LMFAO
[5:42:01] shattiiee: dsg and moist are just pet projects, they are literally just money sinkholes
[5:42:23] Fossabot: IfYouCantSeeThisEmoteUseExclamationMark7tv
[5:42:32] dot_ed: even in bigger scene like league they make zilch, can't imagine apex
[5:42:44] RosarioVonLi: yeah pet projects from celebrities can only be short term, but better than nothing
[5:43:13] ElementCo_27: needs to become more marketable
[5:43:18] shattiiee: plus live attendance, ticket/merch/food prices are a huge income
[5:43:41] x3shiina: I think esports fan are not willing to pay to watch esports.
[5:44:07] RosarioVonLi: yeah ..
[5:44:18] Tedium2: and also the viewers are now used to it being free if u make it behind a paywall they will lose interest
[5:44:19] reeshx: trick them
[5:44:24] reeshx: scammaz
[5:44:34] Neoripo: Scamming
[5:44:49] Tedium2: I think game skins Hmmm like what valo does
[5:44:53] reeshx: 99 cents per chat message
[5:44:57] deriece404: game skin ?
[5:45:02] momo_riu: If only eSports was at global level eg Olympics
[5:45:16] shattiiee: its just, if the core content is free, then my mindset is less likely to spend on other things like merch
[5:45:19] RosarioVonLi: LAN is as much as they could pay for esports tickets
[5:45:24] ElementCo_27: reesh got that EA strat PepeLa
[5:45:25] Tedium2: OME apex doesnt count
[5:45:38] reeshx: OMEGADANCEBUTFAST
[5:45:45] deriece404: apex scam skin ICANT
[5:45:49] r3dshad0ww: League does a good job if I remember correctly using the fund they get from the worlds skin for worlds
[5:45:50] kryanknight: Lol with their worlds skins are very profitable
[5:45:57] ElementCo_27: oddly enough Halo does skins, and they also give a large majority of profits from the skins to the orgs
[5:45:57] shattiiee: with normal sports, im already paying for tickets, so ive already spent money so might as well buy some merch too
[5:46:15] x3shiina: Yea
[5:46:27] SmolKavi: And with the layoffs, shit's gonna be more challenging from now on rprSad
[5:46:32] deriece404: is region split also make it dying ? like its not global enough
[5:46:39] ElementCo_27: what could have been with Infinite PepeHands
[5:46:51] ElementCo_27: its coming back though, im enjoying playing it at least
[5:47:47] shattiiee: how long has kn been around btw?
[5:47:49] dot_ed: a lot of industries are in rough patch atm, can't imagine esport in seeing that much profit
[5:48:02] r3dshad0ww: r3dshad0ww subscribed at Tier 1. 
[5:48:06] deriece404: its still in post recovery covid right ?
[5:48:38] reeshx: BRUH
[5:48:55] deriece404: yeah
[5:49:28] shattiiee: and well, during covid a lot of businesses boomed so they overhired, and now that things are settled back they realized oh shit
[5:49:35] wintrval: I guess it's more simple for normies
[5:50:03] ElementCo_27: yep pretty much, nothing to do during covid so it was spent online
[5:50:56] ElementCo_27: also it's hard for a majority of folks to have disposable income, so unfortunately a sub is a quick thing to cut from budget
[5:51:09] SmolKavi: Now big companies are on a hiring freeze lol
[5:51:12] deriece404: any possible that you gonna do youtube stream also ?
[5:51:13] RosarioVonLi: some of them must have considered that but say 'fuck it the worst could happen after a few years, is just laying these people off', and they did
[5:51:18] slimeforyou: any plans or thoughts to switch platforms?
[5:51:36] reeshx: looks like mande there on the ground
[5:51:42] deriece404: ah ok
[5:51:45] ElementCo_27: simulcast
[5:51:46] menczi_: simulcast
[5:51:47] RosarioVonLi: yeah I saw lots of folks doing that
[5:51:48] SmolKavi: You would still see their job posts so many people applied to those jobs without realizing that they won't get hired at all
[5:51:49] deriece404: simulcast
[5:52:13] wintrval: Become a fully Corpo Vtuber ok
[5:52:17] ElementCo_27: you'd need beefy upload, yes
[5:52:17] deriece404: but, is twitch allow it ? like since you are partner with them
[5:52:23] ElementCo_27: twitch allows it yes
[5:52:30] shattiiee: does japan have its own popular platform?
[5:52:48] RosarioVonLi: niconico
[5:52:51] unknown_weeblord: Nico Nico tv

[5:55:20] unknown_weeblord: Yes space
[5:55:21] slimeforyou: thats space
[5:55:23] pangwang1: yeah, twitcasting is a jp company, twitter spaces are just voice chats u can join i guess
[5:55:23] RosarioVonLi: videos are there, it's just most people got used to listen to it only, so people like matsuri, tsuna chiichan etc. only do chatting audio only streams there
[5:55:25] momo_riu: I only saw mikeneko using twit but I think it's only voice
[5:55:53] „ÉÅ„É†„Éº„Åï„Çì: I listen to matsuri clean her house in twitcasting OME
