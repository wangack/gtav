[1:51:01] Nubbz1992: Fire Benji. Earth Benji. Water Benji. Air Benji. Long ago, the four Benjis lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the Fire Benji attacked. Only the B, master of all four elements, could stop them, but when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years passed and my brother and I discovered the meat bender named B. And although his meatbending skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone. But I believe B can save the world

Only the B, master of all four elements, could stop them, but when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years passed and my brother and I discovered the meat bender named B. And although his meatbending skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone. But I believe B can save the world

Only the B, master of all four elements, could stop them, but when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years passed and my brother and I discovered the meat bender named B.

[3:21:06] too_high_ty: I was only nine years old. I loved Lysium so much, I had all the merchandise and sponsor merch. I'd pray to Lysium every night before I go to bed, thanking for the life I've been given. "Lysium is love", I would say, "Lysium is life". My dad hears me and calls me a redditor. I knew he was just jealous for my devotion of Lysium. I called him a Juicer. He slaps me and sends me to go to sleep. I'm crying now and my face hurts.

[5:01:22] alldayerryday: Fire Benji. Earth Benji. Water Benji. Air Benji. Long ago, the four Benjis lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the Fire Benji attacked. Only the B, master of all four elements, could stop them, but when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years passed and my brother and I discovered the meat bender named B. And although his meatbending skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone. But I believe B can save the world
