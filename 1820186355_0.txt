[0:33:10] danktoomuch: Shrug
[0:33:20] bonegazi: When exporting audio in Audacity, by default, all exports are mixed down to mono (one channel) or stereo (two channels). However, if you pan any mono tracks to left or right or if there are any stereo tracks among the tracks to be exported, the tracks are mixed to a stereo file.1 If you want to export to more channels, enable "Use custom mix" in Import / Export Preferences. After pressing "Save" in the export dialog, the Advanced Mixing Options dialog appears where you can map the Audacity track
