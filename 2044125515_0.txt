[3:54:55] insanitaria: What's the story behind calling server restart Tsunami ?
[3:55:02] datascribe: i think tt is more like the cops are told to not continue if it is too dangerous, makes sense

[8:25:43] e1k4bong: To be fair, rhe racks are gonna be worth nothing as soon as everyone has access
[8:25:43] magnefis: 5k btc is ok no ?
[8:25:46] setraaaa: You cant monopolize a market when you sell product in bulk like that, if you have bulk you can offer best prices.
[8:25:48] Sh4rkill3r: @Mohgley x told benji to tell him no, because he didnt want to tell him himself. dex is never gonna be more than an asset. the moment house robery unlock, no one will care about weed

[8:26:18] Rog1veN: @Ray__C yeah and to get to this BP you need so much BUTC
[8:26:18] VADICKUS007: well you had to stop at some point with the expanding shit LUL JP went all in on BUTC/day
[8:26:22] olLucky: the more racks ppl have, the lower butcoin price will go
[8:26:24] blurrymp3: @korikoraima sure, but no point in dropping the value in half for no reason
[8:26:27] setraaaa: The moment you guys started selling racks people would eventually sell them themselves because of the surplus of butcoin.
[8:26:28] dikridr: BUTC Demand is low it seems
[8:26:28] vjbranded: terrible driver
[8:26:30] ironabe207: Can't you make 2 per bp

[8:26:34] BE61k: they need to add a civ use for BUTC none of the G6 grinders want it
[8:26:34] korikoraima: 5k-10k a blueprint is high key reasonable especially with how accessible they’re becoming
[8:26:36] dukajoe: Sorry, but folks are not think about this right. With no other things you can do with it, the price of butcoin will only go down
[8:26:38] Biuntx: they need to release coin market
[8:26:40] blickyglizz: if there is bidding wars on jobs u'll still sell out of buttcoin as demand goes up
[8:26:40] Ninja_v1: ray you good? LuL

[8:26:46] mawrk7: OTT  putting kids to sleep
[8:26:53] imacableguy: first rack cost 5 BUTc to get because of drone app.
[8:26:54] 234yh: imo the worst thing about it all is that yuno lied to ray about him selling bp for 15k
[8:26:54] IshvaraV: anyone saying undercut does not understand business and its obvious lmao
[8:26:54] SurvivorPlayz999: tell him 5k per butt better then 10k per BP lol

[8:27:04] TimHongisto: Isn't it smarter to sell the blueprints, than the butcoin. That way they feel like they get something fysical?
[8:27:08] swordinfinity: @3lonpich so why budhha going killer maniac when people undercut his material market ?
[8:27:08] PolishGarnek: @korikoraima 2 but and acces to pc with  drone app and wifi, that's  worth a lot
[8:27:09] JMacEvo: Benji did Dex so dirty that I hope CG scoops him up and moves them ahead. The company will finally start valuing the people they do business with
