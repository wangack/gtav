[1:40:59] ValuableBoring: you spend so many days doing runs to make 250-500 a run
[1:41:00] ltl_wackman: i feel like its bearable like you get to race around during the perfect time period to not get speeding tickets but not sure tbh
[1:41:02] BlastedRoyal: @Psychedelicx_ rats will get caught, they just need to lower their rates
[1:41:02] double_h5432: It makes no sense for civ jobs to pay more tbh
[1:41:10] MingsPrio: They have their own they are cleaning aswell. And fanny wants to adjust her rates
[1:41:10] socksy6: nice when you guys can do 2 at the same time

[1:41:51] nerdwolfv: @BeMy_Friend thank youuuuuuu
[1:41:52] BlastedRoyal: they could also just make it so you can do more than 5k/500 per
[1:42:02] daamsam: Damn. There's some other gang literally doing it in 5 split run in a group
[1:42:03] zuckscalulator: Ye
[1:42:04] 4HeadsDustyGun: An hour of sani is easily 5k-10k

[1:42:08] coomiehilfiger: yes
[1:42:09] 911_raj: There  should something at 100 rep
[1:42:09] 4headsEmptyWallet: So many people getting caught doing money run will help u get better rates for sure
[1:42:11] xx_josh0_xx: you can do it in-between waiting for a ac job

[1:43:05] 8revolution: FeelsLagMan
[1:43:12] 4HeadsDustyGun: So far crim rep doesn't do shit. Only civ rep has benefits in the server. Hopefully one day crim rep gives something

[1:46:28] SameAsEveryOtherDay: I keep hearing people saying that they sell faster now, but I haven't seen anyone do it since then
