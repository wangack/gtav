[3:15:05] SleekDMC: lol Charlie L
[3:15:19] GavinMazey: Amazon is laying off people across most of their platforms
[3:15:39] Crazyman114: 1k per concurrent viewers is great
[3:15:45] enemys0ng: From what I've read, it was an Amazon decision. They also laid off people from MGM & another
[3:16:05] SleekDMC: viewers plateau since 2020 but defo upping that ad rev
[3:16:08] Sax850: hey
[3:16:40] SleekDMC: AWS: welcome to how to write the books Charlie MyAvatar
[3:16:54] enemys0ng: Totally agree with what youre saying. Anyhting for the shareholders Sadge
[3:17:02] PlatypusLLC: they probably use those server costs to not pay as much taxes
[3:17:14] Sax850: thats hte fucked up part, AWS is a huge platform, and its video encoding cloud scale is fucking massive even compared to other cloud providers
[3:17:19] graveless: nice bicep
[3:17:37] SleekDMC: ppl actually think Amazon would sell twitch to kick lol
[3:17:59] enemys0ng: ew
[3:18:04] Sax850: I mean there is a reason why Amazon/a certain CEO paid 0 in tax the other year
[3:18:22] enemys0ng: mmmmmmm i beg to differ LOL
[3:18:22] Oatmealyeti_: maybe as a brand if they offer enough but its doubtful and they still wont sell ivs which is the backbone of both
[3:18:26] graveless: Does not profitable mean they are taking a loss by writing stuff off
[3:18:57] StreamElements: TRUTH OR DAB THIS THURSDAY -- ASK AWAY https://forms.gle/chyYmFxVEASiFVjn9

[3:19:22] Vizzeek: this is all zackrawrr's fault mhm
[3:19:46] Sax850: im going ot guess they are overcharging the AWS services to avoid paying profit taxes
[3:20:23] beelakeee: Can't wait for gta 6 and to bang wakes mom
[3:20:40] goops: sounds like charlie is just being disingenuous but... why ?
[3:20:57] Vizzeek: did they ever reveal WHAT jobs they laid offs? like what positions?
[3:21:01] enemys0ng: Learned that lesson at my last job. It was a very progressive company rightttttt until I needed medical accomodations
[3:21:06] GavinMazey: Charlie hasnt been great lately imo
[3:21:49] Rainbow_Xi: dans fine, but theres something a lil bit fishy about him...
[3:21:52] Sax850: yeah
[3:21:53] SleekDMC: he writes thumbnail vid titles then finds a narrative to suit lol
[3:22:17] basedhero1: mHm
[3:22:29] enemys0ng: I read the 500 positions were considered by the company as unnecessary but I'm sure only the people who worked in or around those positions actually know.
[3:22:45] SleekDMC: his for becoming a partner plus streamer UP THE DAN
[3:22:46] Payday1989: Payday1989 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! yo
[3:23:01] daman11: look at zach bussey twitter twitch is paying crazy amount for office space in san fran

[3:24:29] Sax850: Amazon might do "Twitch, powered by Amazon!" or so
[3:24:31] essarrbee: Amazon didn't buy Twitch to do things for twitch. They bought it so Twitch could do stuff for Amazon. AWS IVS is twitch's tech resold to other companies.
[3:24:38] CheesieChrist: I think the second Amazon bought Twitch was the last time Twitch profitability mattered
[3:24:39] GavinMazey: Im kinda suprised they havent put an amazon logo on twitch

[4:54:27] StreamElements: RESPONDED TO DAILY LIVE ON STREAM https://forms.gle/Fu9Yav7MLfik3msUA
[4:54:28] RebelliousRook: Will is jumping on if you still wanted to play your other characters with him. All up to you though
[4:54:32] Benjammar: Maybe you could roleplay that beef is having a down day and lacks purpose
[4:54:52] Weapun_X: you maybe time for maxx moxie with will
[4:54:53] Vizzeek: OOH IT COULD BE MAX TIME Pog
[4:54:58] Weapun_X: *yea
[4:55:18] rawhga: It could be you were denied because of your felony might need to get the expunged first
[4:55:19] triangulartrot: Well just let it help Beef grow
[4:55:20] Acco10x: D:
[4:55:21] HeavyMetalChris: imagine being told you can't have a fake job in a role play game. like that alone is such a weird concept to me.
[4:55:53] Vizzeek: yeah i wish it said why you were denied at least
[4:55:59] RebelliousRook: Oh right, the felony
[4:56:00] aegiszoundyr: ‚ÄúA terrarium for humans‚Äù
[4:56:02] zenyatta: it could be anything
[4:56:09] Harmless_: @wakewilder in my experience most of the reasoning is if they get along with the person that they're hiring. and in most cases doctors in charge of hiring are fucking LAME
[4:56:20] D__Clone: depression from getting denied a job with no explanation, is beef me right now Aware
[4:56:22] zenyatta: impersonating a doctor probably also didn't help lmao
[4:56:39] QuikSH0TNinja: I dont think you can have felonies to be a doctor.
[4:56:46] zenyatta: hey im just spitting guesses
[4:56:54] Oatmealyeti_: i dont think its like that
[4:56:56] aegiszoundyr: The only real doctor present
[4:56:56] suburbanVegeta: impersonating??? he's a very real doctor
[4:56:57] zenyatta: who knows what the reason is
[4:57:01] QuikSH0TNinja: Ive seen 3 docs say they cant get into any crime
[4:57:02] Harmless_: Medical RPers are nutoriously lame as hell
[4:57:04] AllieQuack: STOLEN VALOR om
[4:57:10] Acco10x: Beef could start his own clinic in the country LETSGO
[4:57:10] Harmless_: notoriously *
[4:57:15] Oatmealyeti_: think you only annoyed like that one group you walked away from everyone else had fun
[4:57:25] Vizzeek: imagine being not liked for pretending to be a doctor in a game where they're pretending to be a doctor KEKG
[4:57:34] Acco10x: ReallyMad
[4:57:34] Harmless_: time to get a pocket dev 4Evil
[4:57:34] jazzmaggot: BibleThump
[4:57:42] aegiszoundyr: gatekeepers get out of the way
[4:57:48] zenyatta: @Harmless_ thats not what i've seen. ems/doctors take a lot of abuse from grinders who just want to hurry up and get healed and refuse to RP at all
[4:57:53] Eopatch: hi
[4:57:57] ImpendingAgony: @QuikSH0TNinja Yeah I think they have something similar for police as well. Have to be a certain number of days without a crime or something.
[4:58:00] SpilledBagofIce: Since the message doesn't say which position, it's reasonable for you to call and ask... then you could find out what you could "improve" on if you apply again?
[4:58:02] DartTheBarefootDodo: Does Beef have felonies>?
[4:58:12] Harmless_: @zenyatta that's cause the doctors don't make the RP of getting treated fun lol
[4:58:13] tegawega: exemSad I think we‚Äôre reading to deep into it.
[4:58:21] tegawega: could just be because felony
[4:58:25] clandestyn: there has to be another path don't lose hope mayn
[4:58:43] RebelliousRook: I think reapplying would be worth it
[4:58:45] jazzmaggot: i really wanna know the reason
[4:58:46] zenyatta: @zenyatta ?? whats your idea of a fun doctor RP?
[4:58:48] jet_sow: cop beef PepeLaugh
[4:58:58] zenyatta: honest question
[4:58:58] Harmless_: charismatic and enjoying being there
[4:59:03] StarGazer2o2: Beef knows so many of Docs on staff he really should be here
[4:59:03] AllieQuack: The only possible reason its that its a conspiracy and they all secretly hate beef Kappa
[4:59:03] Weapun_X: everyone loves doctorbeef
[4:59:05] QuikSH0TNinja: If thats the case you could get a lawyer and try to expuge it
[4:59:05] aegiszoundyr: is there an admin that can move this along?
[4:59:11] Oatmealyeti_: @Harmless_ riv dr dickhead midnight bones
[4:59:32] aegiszoundyr: admins permission?
[4:59:41] lounettte: Wait I just came back, did we find out why he was rejected?
[4:59:45] SpilledBagofIce: When 'Mickey" applied like 2 weeks ago... it was all just interview. based.
[4:59:47] zenyatta: im genuinely wondering which streams @Harmless_ watches where they think ems/doctors dont RP correctly
[5:00:03] lounettte: that‚Äôs a shame
[5:00:07] DartTheBarefootDodo: It's def the felony, if you could somehow RP as a underground doc for crims that'd be sick
[5:00:11] lounettte: wakewiL
[5:00:14] Techno9986: plat sod
[5:00:15] Eyliadios: max it up with will
[5:00:15] cedy_g: hello beef
[5:00:19] hereforff9: Persona 5
[5:00:21] Techno9986: play
[5:00:24] Eyliadios: in the meantime
[5:00:29] Harmless_: @zenyatta there is no way to RP correctly
[5:00:40] lounettte: @spilledbagofice that‚Äôs so weird‚Ä¶ did they misplace his application? Hmm
[5:00:45] RebelliousRook: @zenyatta But there are ways to RP incorrectly
[5:01:06] bnsvnu: could slacks help with getting rid of that felony at all or is it permanent
[5:01:07] zenyatta: i've been watching since 3.0 and i dont think ive ever witnessed doctors or ems making things unfun.....except for grinders
[5:01:08] purpsage: A back alley doctor that could only heal you up like 50% would be sick
[5:01:20] SleekDMC: buh
[5:01:27] aegiszoundyr: @rebelliousrook you left out ‚Äúin my opinion‚Äù
[5:01:28] SpilledBagofIce: @lounettte *shrug*
[5:01:37] CultureStudies: Esfand is trying to upon up an entire other PD department and hospital up north in Little Texas. Maybe that is Beefs calling.
[5:01:37] lounettte: all doctors we‚Äôve met so far have been super fun
[5:01:46] Acco10x: what would Beef do in this situation? would he just continue to pretend being a doctor?
[5:01:51] CultureStudies: open*
[5:02:02] rawhga: derek shaw and charlie jannetty are the head doctors according to the wiki have you talked to either one of them?
[5:02:07] zenyatta: @lounettte thats what im saying lmao. i cant think of what sort of player would dislike it so much
[5:02:10] natitime: beef seems much quieter these days
[5:02:15] cedy_g: hi your gaming set is cool
[5:02:19] natitime: refined beef KEKW
[5:02:29] tegawega: ask a dev for doctor permissions to be a shady underground doctor for the criminal underworld
[5:02:39] Harmless_: there are more servers than NP :v
[5:02:40] DartTheBarefootDodo: @CultureStudies Was literally thinking Grandma's residential doctor so Crims don't have to get recorded in the hospital
[5:02:40] Acco10x: PoroSad
[5:02:43] lounettte: pepeHands
[5:02:44] SpilledBagofIce: I mean they have enough docs playing it pretty straight... A quirky doc would be rad.
[5:02:46] RebelliousRook: @aegiszoundyr ... not quite. I have seen legit illegal shit
[5:02:49] cedy_g: very cool
[5:03:32] hereforff9: Beef creeping around the corners alright

[5:05:05] aegiszoundyr: So you‚Äôre talking about non role playing Rebel? That would be categorically stealthy criminal activity and not rp.
[5:05:16] cedy_g: 1 plus 1
[5:05:27] SpilledBagofIce: THe problem with being like an "independant" doctor is without  access to the tools Beef can't actually heal people.

[5:07:55] aegiszoundyr: Right I mean what does it have anything to do with playing a game?
[5:08:27] SpilledBagofIce: Unless Beef asked Epsilon to pull strings for him at the hospital which would be an interesting arc but not sure that is Beef's style.
[5:08:30] zenyatta: if nothing can be done about it rightg now then maybe call it an early RP night and do reacts or somehting?
[5:08:34] bnsvnu: you could try to RP your way out of your felony record, either with the victim or with xavier and the courts
