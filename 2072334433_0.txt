[0:37:32] Kalaava: HECOOKING
[0:37:38] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: saabDap saabDap saabDap saabDap
[0:37:38] Gachiguru: OOOO
[0:37:41] skedaddelr: I mean if it's decided internally you have 1 admin 1 dev 1 crane + siobahn who's gonna support max and he settles ties so if koil and buddha want it it's already passed
[0:37:42] m4l1kkk: Max has 10,000 speech 😭
[0:37:43] samaelulu: OOOO
[0:37:47] fishiegoblublub: this clip on the internet forever lol
[0:37:56] pnumo: Exactly
[0:37:56] blowaways: their plan is to trickle up
[0:37:58] LustyHeart: EXACTLY
[0:37:59] captain_steve_420: Ruth never should've been in charge
[0:38:00] oofa1978: mhm yep
[0:38:02] 95eagles: yup
[0:38:04] fishmeatx: mhm Agreed
[0:38:04] Leigh_OG: agreed the structure has been really weird
[0:38:05] TheDaghda: they went ass side up
[0:38:07] Jcibbn: no
[0:38:07] 360ski: They went from bottom up
[0:38:08] Athasin: Huh?
[0:38:08] LustyHeart: THAT WAS WHAT MAX WANTED TOO
[0:38:09] sorcasd: YES
[0:38:09] Rootbritney: How can you be a Luitenant before you are a senior though?
[0:38:10] jefe_jay_: As it stands the votes on are in Max's favour. Their are 8 council members. His vote counts as two. Siobahn is another. And both Malton and the deputy support the Mayor. If it comes to a draw - the Mayor decides the outcome.
[0:38:11] blowaways: they dont want to fill a senior role until the bottom roles are filled
[0:38:11] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: seniors that never come on duty like de Rolo
[0:38:11] ramsin50: there isn't enough cops for that
[0:38:14] water_flute: who put ruth in charge?
[0:38:14] Gachiguru: or they could have trickled up faster
[0:38:15] Jcibbn: i disagree
[0:38:16] sticks26: Imo the skeleton crew should've been bigger. A lot of the current problems would've been avoided
[0:38:16] tenaja22: they didnt want to loos their pwoer, just kep lackies in place
[0:38:17] TopicTech: they goin backwards
[0:38:18] c0rrexx: they hired characters that were like chief of police and made them start as cadets xdd
[0:38:18] cniall7: cniall7 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[0:38:19] sigmund2121: Well its getting corrected now so
[0:38:19] ramsin50: every one would be a higher up
[0:38:19] mm_noobie: surely a trickle down system will work
[0:38:24] Athasin: You wanted everyone to be Captains and be demoted?
[0:38:25] happensinthegame: today at 6pm

[0:38:30] leo_bwo: They shit the bed in the VERY beginning, by not having a proper structure off the rip
[0:38:30] boxofbookies_: they talked to other council members and they are against max shits finna get interesting asf
[0:38:31] TopicTech: demotions is a thing
[0:38:33] fishiegoblublub: they stood in the stariwell after this for four hours feeling sorry for themselves lol

[0:38:35] Rascal_PM: these are symptoms of the captains showing they are power hungry and they aren’t happy about losing it
[0:38:36] LustyHeart: @jefe_jay_ malton is a snake bruh
[0:38:42] macneutron: @jefe_jay_ It only counts as two if it's a tie
[0:38:45] AnusReaktorMan: @deansocool watch pls
[0:38:52] Canal9000: FirstTimeChadder
[0:38:53] MoohamedAlii: it should 've been that on the skeleton crew
[0:38:53] viralostrich: Im delusional so I voted NO
[0:38:54] lKouRa: trueeeeeeeeee
[0:38:54] LoneSoldier021: they want the opposite. they want cops to experience each position to work their way up, but they were hired straight as captains
[0:38:57] zuze: policing the police rp PogU
[0:38:59] omascas: They change the captains to change the sops and hire more officers, its already being done
[0:39:04] Xierany: They are doing the promotions, just doing it much too slow really
[0:39:05] fishmeatx: OH thats waaaaaaay better
[0:39:05] mtmathes: Imagine your officer in the military having no NCOs for troops so they can do officer shit
[0:39:08] quaylewastaken: But their firing cops for rping
[0:39:10] ramsin50: turner wanted to demote her
[0:39:11] 360ski: True
[0:39:13] leo_bwo: That would be HELLA good
[0:39:15] P51F144: roll it back 15seconds
[0:39:16] happensinthegame: you should of seen after , the mayor showed up to the station and no pds were on duty but 4 people were in the building with doors/garages opened 🤣🤣

[0:39:23] KingJayClouted: bro ngl
[0:39:25] Doqx42: The hierarchy should of been built from the chosen skeleton crew that was selected to build it out, however everyone on skeleton crew was "old guard" and was already on chopping block
[0:39:27] dharentk: HOLY SHIT this is based
[0:39:29] mikewhocheesehairyyyy12: Let him cook
[0:39:31] KingJayClouted: wait u was in the military
[0:39:33] SciOps: If there's to many rank do they mean anything though? @Deansocool
[0:39:35] WeirdBeardPlays: There should of been a plan in place to give people proper training from DAY 1 of server launch and there are undefined rules and guidelines that only exist because there is a LACK of proper training so you have officers running around with their heads cut off stumbling into DAPable scenarios
[0:39:38] jefe_jay_: @macneutron Are you sure? Maybe I misunderstood.
[0:39:39] felinegurl: yeah this whole thing was reminding me of previous leadership PepeLaugh
[0:39:40] dharentk: omg this is so cathartic to hear him tear them a new one
[0:39:40] fishiegoblublub: LETTETH THY COOKETH

[0:39:43] synzzo: hooah

[0:39:47] LustyHeart: let this guy speak a sentence
[0:39:52] KingJayClouted: hooooah
[0:39:53] longhorns2565: demotion is simple dude that’s how it should have been worded to and about den not a firing
[0:39:54] taffletv: Its a massive problem that high counsil have to review the high counsil. So review of daps will never be corrected if they are wrong
[0:39:56] Str1de: @KingJayClouted 8 month sub and you don't know this? damn lol
[0:39:58] m4l1kkk: 1 cop on duty 😂😂😂
[0:39:59] danielb2705: Do it

[0:40:01] ZannahValin: Yeah the PD is way too realistic imo
[0:40:03] KingJayClouted: cornwood not getting fired
[0:40:03] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: 
[0:40:04] kalesauce8: there is no way cornwood gets fired after this
[0:40:06] AsuniRS: "cornwood please play more than 18 hours a day so you can fto 1 person" is what he just said OMEGALUL
[0:40:08] blowaways: he doesnt take accountability for his own department
[0:40:13] KingJayClouted: @str1de I was in the military too
[0:40:13] 360ski: Cause they are too busy doing police work
[0:40:15] chmbrs: @Str1de its not regularly talked about
[0:40:15] fishiegoblublub: not everyone in the PD is going to be a perfect (fake) cop, they are just obsessive over performance
[0:40:16] BDG_Toa676: deansoPopcorn deansoPopcorn
[0:40:18] macneutron: @jefe_jay_ Yeah, it counts as two incase of tie, to break the tie
[0:40:19] TewetersonOG: they be worrying about cops more than what a crim oes
[0:40:19] quaylewastaken: Their firing cops for rping tho

[1:16:41] ChoobiOne: he got 6 daps.. 1 for joking about something and 5 for the shooting
[1:16:41] ilostuniverse: Nah he had a thing with Brian Knight snd aziz
[1:16:42] jeremyks9: they fired Denzel for less and the shooting made Cornwood sound worse
[1:16:44] the_main_burt: @FLCK3R its only less than 5 daps if it was excessive force with non lethal
[1:16:45] Blizzard5050: but they have no love for going over their heads
[1:16:46] Tylerfosho: brian knight situtation with cornwood and aziz also
[1:16:47] DaiKi_gg: i think the major stuf runs out on the 27 \th
[1:16:47] thewookie34: The PD doesnt want to pay back the 200k to cornwood he loaned them. It's easy to see why they want to fire them.
[1:16:49] KingIAm: ivibamClap ivibamClap ivibamClap ivibamClap ivibamClap ivibamClap

[1:16:52] claptil: They are 100%
[1:16:53] ajay311: Johnson a real one though supporting the thin blue line last night
[1:16:53] entvidya: they dumped 2 mags - 24 bullets - into this 1 life character, and he gets 5 daps for it for +1 bullet on a guy already made of swiss cheese
[1:16:54] Lupusdeus: which they are i reckon
[1:16:54] Freddiepines: Clueless
[1:16:55] Blizzard5050: They are
[1:16:56] TopicTech: they fired you off an approved pit @Deansocool
[1:16:56] AshleyJordan235: okay but after 11 daps you get fired
[1:16:56] KNGRSM: Turner and Ruth want to charge him with murder @Deansocool
[1:16:57] AnusReaktorMan: MAYOR COOKING
[1:16:58] DamnitAngel_: he tried to get knight to change his report and they're saying its coercion
[1:16:58] davidpeck_: making joke about fake charges
[1:16:58] Mallyraws: they seemed very salty lol
[1:16:59] fishmeatx: this is all just drama content for people in my head idk about u guys
[1:17:00] Promoniks: No way he should get fired for any of that, "punishments" yes @Deansocool
[1:17:01] sKingNA: @MadderHatter FACTS
[1:17:01] the_main_burt: i dont think he should of got dapped for the brian knight situation

[1:17:04] tyler__96: They are gonna charge him with murder ofc he is fired
[1:17:04] Blizzard5050: SUPER salty
[1:17:04] supaiiii: Clueless and surely they aren't
[1:17:05] turbochoochoo: Except Ruth claims "he could be charged for murder"
[1:17:06] Mallyraws: and turner said he wasnt an officer
[1:17:06] CaptLaw44: But the meeting is today
[1:17:07] fishiegoblublub: they fire him bc they're pompous sycophants
[1:17:07] J_Stomi: how is knight even a cop as of now, he lied and shoot someone, but jhonson and you fired and  cornwood got  suspeded
[1:17:07] Canal9000: @ramsin50 250k 50/50 prediction?
[1:17:08] MadderHatter: they were totally doing it cause they struck and walked out for you, and cause he went to the mayor
[1:17:09] Paxipher: i got 80k all my points on 2
[1:17:11] GoldenTugboat: they were talking about giving him a felony
[1:17:11] eliteone11: City is cooked if Cornwood is terminated
[1:17:12] Paxipher: tails
[1:17:13] Bigeyez: Nah he is gone. Don't want to Meta but 100% he is gone
[1:17:14] TraviiiOnTwitch: they were talking pushing a murder charge bro it’s cooked
[1:17:15] Jethrq: @Zedael When Malton was Chief in 3.0, Dean was his Ass Chief
[1:17:15] Silvertap: Make the 25th say he is family of 23th and pardon Cornwood
[1:17:15] el_cappo22: they seem to be holding grudgesss bro
[1:17:16] ComplexPandaSinger: By why would he? If he gets fired it will be some vendetta shit
[1:17:16] SpiritEX: Copege
[1:17:16] fishmeatx: cuz hes too based
[1:17:16] Bruhbear: Cornwood was getting 0.0039 daps per hour, he was suspended for the 11 he got, and they take 60 days to fall off
[1:17:19] ZuldeadTV: denzel was an example
[1:17:20] bomon14: I’m confused how they fire you on black history month🤦🏽‍♂️ .anyways, stay strong my brother
[1:17:20] a2th3vi: They're making an example of denzel
[1:17:21] Lord_Legolas: Cornwood overcooked a little
[1:17:22] BDG_Toa676: Example?
[1:17:22] Paxipher: Prayge tails
[1:17:23] AshleyJordan235: you can’t just only fired the cops who are pissy lol
[1:17:24] CatmanJay: they said to Max they would charge him with murder lol
[1:17:24] Citystar619: Yeah but cornwoods char is a virus to the PD everyone knows whats goin on internal cuz of him abdulM abdulRP
[1:17:26] KingJayClouted: but fired Johnson for what ??? punching ????
[1:17:26] SargentNavi: tbf they did approve that pit
[1:17:28] Kiwix: made an example out of u
[1:17:31] BDG_Toa676: Like to set one
[1:17:32] Canal9000: ramsin50 o7 250k points
[1:17:32] Freddiepines: they fired you "to make an example"
[1:17:33] VYBZhfx: straw that broke the camels back
[1:17:34] jeremyks9: They also said cornwood told an officer change his statement
[1:17:34] Paxipher: @Citystar619 nawww dude
[1:17:35] ctrlectrld: Den Zel was made an example, that is clear
[1:17:36] imtoolazytoputaname: surely it will hit tails again right Clueless
[1:17:36] modooc56: ruth might fire him and charge him with murder KEKW
[1:17:36] NemoBlu: seems too lenient if they didnt in their mind
[1:17:37] Blizzard5050: You were suspended for a week
[1:17:38] KingJayClouted: Johnson never had a dap and still got fired cuh
[1:17:39] Zedowel: They fired Den cause his trash PC could not load Johnson in the distance lol
[1:17:40] fishmeatx: IG but still BS
[1:17:41] renziboss: Dean always the example
[1:17:42] PacGamer: They could have done the retaining without being fired
[1:17:43] CuBanMumzy: @thewookie34  you do know he pulled them out and are in his locker right?
[1:17:46] supaiiii: well ok, but how is cornwood not the same case then?
[1:17:46] duckuru: well dap is rework
[1:17:47] the_main_burt: @Citystar619 bro what ?
[1:17:47] Landoram: How about demotion before firing?
[1:17:47] KingJayClouted: right he was suspended
[1:17:48] TheKingOfWit: well, it was just supposed to be a review, maybe correct you and give you a probation, they didn't just need to fire you
[1:17:51] fishmeatx: oh no PepeLaugh ]
[1:17:51] PacGamer: Retraining*
[1:17:52] yeoja_dart: Lenny has 5 confirmed pit kills
[1:17:53] CaptLaw44: I feel that they are missing cop and fire u maby a downrank would be better no?
[1:17:53] russo458: but daps as it is, is already questionable
[1:17:56] Eruwawa: There is no middle ground and status quo, its either up or down for Cornwood imo.
[1:17:59] JakeStratic: That is kind of dumb though. The point of the daps is warning and then could have punished without firing and the atmopshere would have improved but they fired you and everything crashed @Deansocool
[1:17:59] KingIAm: ivibamWritethatdown
[1:18:00] BDG_Toa676: Does lifeguard count?
[1:18:00] genesissukehiro: CO here lol yep
[1:18:01] Mallyraws: @KingJayClouted yeah they did johnson dirty
[1:18:01] CatmanJay: @kingjayclouted  no shit CUH YO YO
[1:18:02] theblackdog808: Yea
[1:18:02] mrchainsaw13: toxic lol
[1:18:03] Emeralblade: They were firing the first to 10 no matter what. Didn't matter the circumstances.
[1:18:03] brokenchairOwner: @Deansocool how long has the PD been a thing?
[1:18:04] russo458: that makes 0 sense
[1:18:06] Xierany: Johson had to get fired, you didn't. Was totally not fair firing you
[1:18:06] greenburg22: gonna take u a month to get through cadet, 3 ftos 30 cadets
[1:18:06] LoneSoldier021: the goal of the daps is to highlight areas where you need improvement
[1:18:07] TheKingOfWit: ok yes, i feel these guys trying to show they're in charge
[1:18:08] rabbyraptor: Asserting dominance
[1:18:09] TheDaghda: Break you down to build you up
[1:18:09] mootywooty: sounds like prisoin
[1:18:09] imtoolazytoputaname: bully

[1:18:11] khlaah: 100%
[1:18:12] mootywooty: sounds like prison
[1:18:13] DamnitAngel_: limit testing
[1:18:13] f0rbin: you were an example
[1:18:13] AshleyJordan235: @kingjayclouted your firing was the biggest bullshit because the dap was only for the punching but the firing was because you “lied” but you didn’t lie you just missed like two random things they wanted you to include
[1:18:14] RyinTwitch: https://clips.twitch.tv/NiceNurturingYakinikuPeteZaroll-CioxqrN7uF6tJxNh
[1:18:14] Blizzard5050: That’s why they need that Union
[1:18:15] zfalcorz: I don't think it had the effect they wanted LUL
[1:18:16] fishiegoblublub: Slacks made his DAPs up on the spot to win an  argument and defend Ruth
[1:18:16] LoveNeverLoved: still could have demoted you to prove the same point
[1:18:17] Dreloc: yeah but Authority != Respect
[1:18:18] matanzlatan2000: firing and showing "a little authority" doesn't sound the same to me
[1:18:19] Mardomus: Their showing was the wrong image and it shows to all
[1:18:19] TheGrayK: Daps are arbitrary at this point though
[1:18:21] Evilzanz: saving face
[1:18:21] Vendatus: Bruh if they try to charge him with murder Max would just pardon it lol
[1:18:21] duckuru: but no fun rp?
[1:18:22] GoldenTugboat: the fear of god
[1:18:22] CatmanJay: INTEGRITY @kingjayclouted
[1:18:22] ajay311: My problem is that the people doing the daps and firing are the Same giving out reviews! There should be a panel
[1:18:22] Zunnun: Dean did you read saabs comment he asked if you wanted to chill when you come to texas @deansocool
[1:18:24] neferipit0: Kappa
[1:18:24] vQuikzyUT: I’m in the British army love the yanks
[1:18:25] jeremyks9: Denzel was an example the way it was announced
[1:18:26] karaskyee: setting the tone
[1:18:29] HyperThreded: nah don’t excuse Ruth
[1:18:29] destinygun: @deansocool They pushed a false 1 dap for brian knight thing to hit 10 daps when his daps falls of at the 27th
[1:18:30] TheKingOfWit: but you don't 'have' to, it seems to be making people hate them
[1:18:30] thewookie34: @CuBanMumzy You do know he did other things then the Turbo right?
[1:18:31] genesissukehiro: happens every sharriff change
[1:18:31] KingJayClouted: Johnson didn’t lie
[1:18:32] zfalcorz: if you overdo it people lose trust tho
[1:18:33] greenburg22: but firing you isn’t helping u learn lmao
[1:18:35] KingJayClouted: he couldn’t remember
[1:18:35] Hodgeybob: @mootywooty thats the military lol
[1:18:37] wheelyhigh: Yeah but is this real life or a content server
[1:18:41] Lord_Legolas: Yea but it's military, no RP
[1:18:42] fishmeatx: good RP but bad for fun stuff
[1:18:42] xypher85: @Zunnun he did zun
[1:18:43] HallusH: wasnt like the first daps one of them was telling for fanny kinda to speed it up and not drag it to court kinda in ooc way. while ruth stood there behind them beside the gun waves and cuffing
[1:18:43] AshleyJordan235: @kingjayclouted like if punching a suspect is a dap, then “lying” on a report is a fucking dap too!!!!
[1:18:48] a2th3vi: 3 captains defending themselves to the end
[1:18:48] Fossabot: If your enjoying the stream smash the DAMN follow button! I mean shit its just a click away... Might see your name on screen ;)

[1:18:57] MadderHatter: lol that's so funny
[1:19:01] ctrlectrld: if they keep it it needs to be consistent, based on hours worked and have supervision
[1:19:03] Freddiepines: give it some RP ffs
[1:19:03] jukla12: @Deansocool check the ISO song KEKW shit slaps https://clips.twitch.tv/SteamyBombasticScorpionEleGiggle-M_o6WbL3WPQmzLwv
[1:19:04] meatlove69: true
[1:19:04] neferipit0: LUL
[1:19:04] fkingjagaloon: idk about firing tho like its a video game unless they doing corrupt shit just have cruel and unsual punishments
[1:19:05] JustChelsay: what’s annoying is there was an additional conversation between the seniors and the captains talking about DAP’s and how they might adjust it and what they forget to consider is how long an individual person is on duty for (Cornwood 14 hours for example)
[1:19:06] Velminth: Myea but they don't apply it to every rook like the army does
[1:19:06] n0oxaskek: most dapped person in PD i janitor and responsible for car repairs
[1:19:07] crystalinewolf: daps done right are good..they are just misused for now

[1:19:21] KingJayClouted: fired cuh
[1:19:23] Rillenord: @Deansocool It gunna pass for sure, just gunna be a sucky 2weeks waiting for legislation to kick in
[1:19:23] Dautrat: @Deansocool when in the course of a felony another felony occurs that felony is the responsibility of said felon. Did they charge the felon for the johnson incident
[1:19:23] matanzlatan2000: thank you for being reasonable
[1:19:24] SimpOnMyShrimp: monkaLaugh

[2:34:09] Asleepenn: most good officers are onx sadly, i think to fix pd, we need sheriff office open, promote more people, hire more people( u have people all the time in lobby asking to join force)

[7:06:24] farclarity: turner said to shoot yes but i dont think he meant shoot two inches away from clacks
[7:06:25] doggensteinn: itd be funny if ramee says denzel
[7:06:26] CaptLaw44: lenny want a dap thats what his hunting
[7:06:27] CyboargTV: Yeah they knew that whatever Slacks was saying was conflicted so Turner was like, "Listen to me, we're shooting on my call."
[7:06:27] farclarity: slacks*
[7:06:33] Madani12: not a officer anymore??
[7:06:37] CyboargTV: Lenny still shot first though LUL

[7:07:45] AndreSays: @Landoram like what for example? I missed it
[7:08:08] tarun_21: He gonna have to go through 50 doors of MRDP to get to Ruth
[7:08:11] Landoram: @AndreSays I won't be specific but cops shooting out tires, running people over and not stopping, etc
[7:08:14] Marvdizzle: @CyboargTV he's manipulating laws "conveniently" that affect all of CG.
[7:08:15] sirbrandonrocks: @c0rrexx they shouldn't of shot 1 foot away from slacks and without getting approval.
[7:08:16] Groox: oliver = gg EZ

[7:08:28] nameismathias: is mr k in jail ???
[7:08:30] mushroom_shame: are cops too restricted or go overboard? It can't be both and CG says either one based on if they're winning
[7:08:31] leftmatez: REVENGE gabsiEvil
[7:08:35] Athasin: @tarun_21 Unless Dab gets that law passed and forces her to patrol
[7:08:37] Evilzanz: who is oliver?
[7:08:38] CyboargTV: @Marvdizzle Was Crane the judge on the case last night?
[7:08:40] LoneSoldier021: Are you going to get your hands dirty?
[7:08:43] Kaisenjin: Why it GG?
[7:08:47] theblackdog808: I hope he does, it'd be a fun case to watch
[7:08:55] SecretHugz: Dont do crime
[7:08:55] itisacar: dean bout to slide
[7:08:56] slymox: Jackson was the judge last night
[7:08:57] inKs_: @Evilzanz a lawyer im pretty sure
[7:08:57] Marvdizzle: @CyboargTV nah, that was some other guy. never seen em before
[7:08:57] Caeros: Crazy how everyone came to CG
[7:09:01] Athasin: @mushroom_shame It can be both because there are multiple cops.
[7:09:04] slymox: Oliver was the prosecuting attorney
[7:09:04] purplepoodle89: @nameismathias he had like a 80 minute charge, should be out this morning
[7:09:06] woosaahh_: @CyboargTV all the laws he pushed was a straight counter to ramme and cg
[7:09:19] xypher85: Tarun Stare
[7:09:25] nameismathias: ah thanks
[7:09:29] Atr1n_exe: @xypher85 what
[7:09:31] TheDev97: pelony
[7:09:32] Architank: @mushroom_shame Right now it seems like "content cops" are being heavily restricted while "SOP cops" are given more leniency when they mess up.
[7:09:32] Athasin: @mushroom_shame Some cops have their hands tied (Denzel) other cops are allowed to go overboard (Hawk)
[7:09:34] Nadeflow: pelonies KEKW
[7:09:35] c0rrexx: @sirbrandonrocks i'm talking about in general, cops get aggressive because crims treat them as another gang, going on a killing spree after an arrest
[7:09:37] slymox: Crazy gun licenses come out as soon as Ramee goes down
[7:09:41] saadman99: pelony
[7:09:42] CyboargTV: Max gonna love if CG go after Crane LUL
[7:09:46] Landoram: I bet ammo will be nuts
[7:09:50] mushroom_shame: @Athasin Denzel and Cornwood would have shot just like Lenny yesterday

[7:10:12] Atr1n_exe: peepoSlorp peepoSlorp givin out slurps for 1 dollar
[7:10:14] Athasin: @mushroom_shame Nah Denzel would've listened to Turner. Cornwood would've shot though.
[7:10:33] LoneWolf_N7: @mushroom_shame nah den too scared of daps to shoot KEKW
[7:10:39] LoneSoldier021: Bullets and mags can't be traced but guns def can
[7:10:41] mushroom_shame: @Athasin Turner said to shoot though. Said to ignore slacks
[7:10:59] Athasin: @mushroom_shame No he said to shoot when he says, and then he said to shoot.
[7:11:11] leviathan297: @mushroom_shame honestly Cornwood is all talk when it comes to shooting, unless it's some sbs
[7:11:18] Athasin: @Athasin he *never said to shoot. He never actually gave the order.
[7:11:27] Atr1n_exe: Jammies Jammies Dance Dance AlienPls AlienPls AlienPls2 AlienPls2
[7:11:29] Kaisenjin: @mushroom_shame Esfand hold his impulse to start the shooting

[7:11:42] SoggyM0uth: Dance
[7:11:45] dharentk: on black history month!?
[7:12:01] JakeStratic: There was confusion... unintentional or not it made out for good RP. I mean, there are consequences to a triple PD hostage situation.
[7:12:13] Kiwi_lul: cornwood literally got 5 daps for magdumping someone
[7:12:27] VioraX: should put a mask on
[7:12:28] n0oxaskek: @leviathan297 have you seen him cornrolling in front of snr buns and magdumping 2 sumbitches when they came at him with knifes?
[7:12:30] JakeStratic: But they got so confused, the PD may just have f'd up the trial... RP will tell
[7:12:36] Kaisenjin: @leviathan297 Esfand know when to start sbs or maintain the RP going
[7:12:39] slight621: @Kiwi_lul And he'd do it again lol
[7:12:45] mushroom_shame: @Kaisenjin I just don't get how DAPing more is going to fix anything. When the problem is too many DAPs
[7:12:53] CyboargTV: Is a crowbar just for sewer access or other shit too?
[7:12:54] ignRass: moneyrun whip
[7:13:15] Athasin: @mushroom_shame The problem is the inconsistency.
[7:13:26] aniquilattion: BONK THEMMMMM
[7:13:28] Athasin: @mushroom_shame And no way to appeal your case.
[7:13:31] m4l1kkk: Peanut will make Dean into a thug again deansoBozo
[7:13:31] slight621: @mushroom_shame It led to this, which is soon going to fix the problem.. Ruth is going to be gone soon one way or another hopefully

[7:14:35] maofinn: D:
[7:14:43] mushroom_shame: @slight621 it's just a weird narrative that Lenny gets any leniency or something, he's probably the next to get suspended
[7:15:01] Kaisenjin: @mushroom_shame Daps are a problem for the police's RP, but the PD is breaking and rewriting SOPs as they want, which creates inconsistencies like this situation, things that some people do don't cause problems for everyone, etc.
[7:15:05] slight621: @mushroom_shame Lenny is one of the mods
[7:15:12] m4l1kkk: Nut would scam the president if he could
