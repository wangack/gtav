[2:42:39] hitguy1: summarisation of the last minute of chat via chatgpt "The chat revolves around a gaming session where users discuss in-game activities, including running away from virtual dangers, planning strategies, and joking about various scenarios. The conversation later shifts to off-topic discussions, such as the stream duration, potential vacations, and even a playful "penis out" phrase, leading to banter about travel plans, packing, and cultural experiences. Some users share humorous remarks"

[2:46:04] Serphology: ddos google invertedly LUL
[2:46:05] hitguy1: @trulyjaada The chat includes supportive messages and humorous comments about a homeless character dancing on a dumpster in a game. A stream idea is suggested where chat messages go through a translator before being read, and there's a discussion about being high. Users mention different games like Half-Life 2, Skyrim, and Paper Mario. One user warns an AI not to mention their message to avoid self-destruction, and there's a mention of Criken playing a Skyrim mod.
[2:46:10] GlutenFreeVapes: very wise OOOO
[2:46:14] cooooooookiw: weren't you getting a taxi

[2:46:45] BammyTheGreat: we're already gibberish
[2:46:52] STACKOFMAIL: so true

[2:57:17] refreshinghotbeer: just put up a "no bedbugs allowed" sign, they legally can't be there
[2:57:18] hitguy1: yes

[2:58:01] bleedinsm0ke: if the dumpster is locked or behind a locked gate it is illegal. However if it is not locked it is regarded as “public space” and therefore legal to dive in head first

[2:59:27] seeliedream: @vanillycake it's so soothing
[2:59:28] refreshinghotbeer: the dont know the grind
[2:59:34] Cyoctane: You're gonna find a gun that was used in a crime eventually
[2:59:34] hitguy1: @bigwooly69 videographer, sorry* but exactly, thats why he's poor
[2:59:43] Fool3y: is this a streamer only rp server?
[2:59:48] trulyjaada: are you staying in Japan long?
[2:59:52] Chickenfoot1282: it's like when you find a 50 dollar bill on the sidewalk and then never look up for the next 6 months
[2:59:52] eazzylile: you should dumpster dive irl in japan
[2:59:53] RepliPlays: waiting for william to find a murder weapon and get framed
[2:59:53] Serphology: are the contents in the cans game generated or do people put that stuff in there

[3:00:16] bigwooly69: penis out
[3:00:18] TristanFrazer: TO RE
[3:00:19] B_ExE_: omg you changed the piss to sand dollars
[3:00:23] vanillycake: @Crinkled_Paper It's a struggle esp hearing other people laugh last second
[3:00:26] joshers251: shadow aliens at the mall
[3:00:29] hitguy1: @Fool3y no queue for streamers, but you can put an aplication in and then get into the normal queue
[3:00:30] Cook1eDaddy: Have you ever been garage sale hopping?
[3:00:31] STACKOFMAIL: ken tucky OOOO
[3:00:32] kkbella7: my fav part was the “idk what gladys does” “neither does she”
[3:00:32] WackyFolf: Grave robbing is a victimless crime
[3:00:33] trulyjaada: LMAO "it's nice to be a normal citizen"
[3:00:34] Chickenfoot1282: I honestly forget this is GTA when i'm watching because of how little crime there is, I forget you can even have guns
[3:00:34] hackoon_: you heard it folks, crime gets old
[3:00:37] squipsy: Civ RP is the best
[3:00:38] FinchFries: Good boy simulator
[3:00:42] young_trashboy_v: glados

[3:01:10] Bombzyz: it’s fun just being a character and not some like big criminal or main character thing
[3:01:12] bigwooly69: spaceboy has some pretty fun rp streams
[3:01:13] BammyTheGreat: POG
[3:01:13] plumpiidae: Jerry Atrick rules

[3:01:40] badnewsbridger: OOOO
[3:01:45] bigwooly69: OOOO
[3:01:47] concade: the reason i dont really like gta rp is it always seems so skewed towards the cops experience
[3:01:53] plumpiidae: @SciFri we love Hiro! hope you've been having a good time with it
[3:02:03] stevedoesmusic: charboSmart charboSmart charboSmart
[3:02:05] yuler_: carcasses are drama baby Slayyy
[3:02:08] Serphology: @concade there were so many in nopixel LUL
[3:02:09] hackoon_: @concade some people REALLY like the power fantasy of being an RP cop
[3:02:13] ThyKingMood: Why are you contantly opening your mouth?
[3:02:13] contendedmike: just ask random ppl what to do with it
[3:02:14] Radcliffe__: venison
[3:02:16] TristanFrazer: of poor quaLITY
[3:02:16] Bombzyz: wonder if these bad boys got ran over
[3:02:17] SciFri: Ive been addicted to this shit lmao @plumpiidae
[3:02:19] hitguy1: @concade not really, unless you break the law then ofc you arent going to have a good time while being arrested
[3:02:20] mezzanoon: huh?
[3:02:27] kitabutts: @concade depends on the serve ryou play on.
[3:02:28] callme_bob: scifri got a problem frfr
[3:02:36] Zombrained: Being an RP cop is like, the least enjoyable shit
[3:02:39] bigwooly69: but the cops have some wacky situations
[3:02:44] plumpiidae: @hackoon_ depends on the person, but you can absolutely tell when they're getting a power trip haha
[3:02:45] Scyreth: i think lisa's experience being the stuntwoman is the best experience tbh. aside from williams
[3:02:46] gourdparent: @concade ya the vibe is very slightly uncomfy
[3:02:49] tsubakiamatsuki: i think the cops see the most, but they have to RP the hardest
[3:02:50] Zenzaxe: true 󠀀
[3:02:51] mezzanoon: i feel like we havent seen much of the cops with charborg
[3:02:51] kitabutts: you gotta remember SO MUCH crap. @>@
[3:02:53] rarek1n: exactly
[3:02:55] wazarddd7320: can you imagine interning with the cops
[3:02:56] Crinkled_Paper: NODDERS
[3:03:01] TheMan630: omidlNodders
[3:03:04] TristanFrazer: The cop that got vigo was a bit a of a rp stopper
[3:03:09] Serphology: i heard theyre better trained than real cops
[3:03:12] marshall207: What is going on here now
[3:03:19] contendedmike: i watched funk some, seemed interesting
[3:03:19] jar_of_rats: i remember there being a lot of goofy cops when you were ken tucky
[3:03:19] Zenzaxe: i think it is more that alot of people used to play to win
[3:03:23] bigwooly69: spacebo has some pretty funny streams playing as an old man named james randal
[3:03:24] plumpiidae: any time we've run into cops so far they've been pretty cool, especially the person who caught yall after the snuff film
[3:03:26] Fool3y: I think it depends if the rpers are providing entertainment or just trying to get rocks off on cop rp
[3:03:28] mezzanoon: i feel like in my mind the cops are the stakes, and if the cops are empowered to to their job, then the stakes are enjoyably higher
[3:03:29] Zenzaxe: less so now
[3:03:32] marshall207: Okay sounds good
[3:03:36] kkbella7: YEP
[3:03:37] alonzaspicywiener: Cops don't get to experience party bus

[3:03:45] rattoota: LUL
[3:03:46] WackyFolf: I thought that was an NPC
[3:03:51] Cyoctane: It's the little moments
[3:03:51] squessii: i think that was the devil himself
[3:03:53] russevfx: 1 of the cops vigo experienced was a bit much but the other like 6 were great.
[3:03:54] Bombzyz: idk but they talked like him LUL

[3:04:22] kkbella7: drama baby
[3:04:22] chocolitmillk: goodnight everyone
[3:04:22] cB_Dogflap: You can't park here
[3:04:27] Kiwi_Mosin: the only way cops experience the party bus is the party bus hitting them at 60mph
[3:04:27] LummTarr: getting em all mixed up lol
[3:04:28] Fool3y: "congratulations"
[3:04:29] plumpiidae: @chocolitmillk night!
[3:04:41] Crinkled_Paper: @chocolitmillk goodnight! :)
[3:04:42] young_trashboy_v: finally!!
[3:04:44] contendedmike: gnight @chocolitmillk
[3:04:46] Bombzyz: it’s fun to have all sorts of personality varieties in big role plays too
[3:04:50] hackoon_: yea it's all situational for sure, but i do think the cops have an "advantage" if that's even close to the right word
[3:04:50] Muelton: this server seems like it has a LOT of cops
[3:04:53] FizzleJysics: Literally make a character, play as said character
[3:04:56] im_sharted: i feel like i wouldnt enjoy it, seems too serious
[3:04:58] cheesetones: put that stuff in the trunk
[3:05:05] TristanFrazer: Just feel half the server is cop rp
[3:05:10] plumpiidae: @Bombzyz yes, and being committed to make the rp enjoyable makes a big difference
[3:05:12] hitguy1: @im_sharted then play a criminal or a civ
[3:05:18] TheMan630: can you fill the back of your pickup with refuse and 4x4's and shit?
[3:05:34] Bombzyz: @plumpiidae exactly exactly it’s fun NODDERS
[3:05:35] etalommi: @hitguy1 or a silly cop, there are some
[3:05:43] Muelton: depends on who you interact with
[3:05:44] kitabutts: there's TONS of rules you have to know and call codes and junk.
[3:05:47] thebmcd: Yeah man paper work city
[3:05:48] vanillycake: the cops have a wild time, but there are some power player cops for sure
[3:05:53] Skittles_the_wonder_puppy: Cops have the fun of stumbling intop a wierd as situation and trying to figure it out. Sounds fun
[3:05:53] plumpiidae: yeah you have to be incredibly invested
[3:05:55] hackoon_: it's kinda hard to ask people to stop doing their bits though
[3:05:58] contendedmike: u can investigate crime scenes sometimes too
[3:06:00] jojothemafioso: damn like a real cop, lots of paperwork
[3:06:00] Cyoctane: Yeah you gotta do things by the book
[3:06:01] XilliterateX: You definitely have to put in the work
[3:06:01] thescarecrowL: @vanillycake just like real life
[3:06:11] Fool3y: you should try it sometime
[3:06:12] Bombzyz: could you be exclusively a detective? that’d be kinda killer
[3:06:14] russevfx: another way to see it is the criminal rp can go pretty deep, so without the cop side it would be pointless.
[3:06:23] AmishHooker: ^
[3:06:24] bigwooly69: yeah very cool especially when theres a murder
[3:06:26] russevfx: they help give purpose and weight to actions
[3:06:35] RepliPlays: being a detective sounds like it could be a ton of fun
[3:06:35] ShinobiHeff: i really like your truck Mr.William
[3:06:36] trulyjaada: there was one cop, something funky, who was dealing with criken when you two were arrested, and he was so cool
[3:06:37] plumpiidae: @russevfx true true
[3:06:37] hackoon_: wow
[3:06:39] hey_there7525: like the cop trying to find out who keeps grave robbing
[3:06:39] XilliterateX: That's sick
[3:06:48] McGurtt: fuck yeah
[3:06:53] marshall207: Sounds wicked
[3:06:55] Crinkled_Paper: dont you also have to go through lengthy training to be a cop on the server?
[3:06:56] skledishs: smart guy
[3:06:59] rattoota: thats some dedicated rp
[3:07:04] plumpiidae: @trulyjaada yes i really liked that person
[3:07:04] hackoon_: you get out what you put into the rp
[3:07:04] redwolf4242: By stream do you mean Law and Order?
[3:07:08] bigwooly69: i watched an old man inject someone with pesticides and get away with murdering him
[3:07:11] vanillycake: I've only seen extremely long hazing interviews to get in
[3:07:15] trulyjaada: @plumpiidae i thought he was super chill
[3:07:17] kitabutts: yeah Vondil is dealing with it right now. it's super weighty and lots to learn.
[3:07:22] AmishHooker: @Crinkled_Paper they use 1:1 radio callouts, gotta know all of em too
[3:07:24] hitguy1: you cant just walk into the backroom and sign on like burger point?
[3:07:24] ThatTotalGuy: @charborg you could be a private eye?
[3:07:32] muttsend: @bigwooly69 he's done that more than once
[3:07:38] hackoon_: in-game? or out of game?
[3:07:39] hypercatjam: The cops who arrested you guys after the snuff film were great
[3:07:40] gourdparent: @vanillycake sus
[3:07:41] squessii: the cops in this rp server are better trained than most police stations
[3:07:51] bigwooly69: @muttsend he has?
[3:07:53] medioxumate: the saga of Cornwood is amazing
[3:08:00] Da_sh1zzle: ketchup chips. yay or nay?
[3:08:01] Crinkled_Paper: @Crinkled_Paper ahhh yeah ive heard about that too thats wild
[3:08:02] trulyjaada: squeex has apparently been trying to make his way up to president
