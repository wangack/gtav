[2:20:10] Sprokkitt: yeah sounds like he's a sheriff regardless
[2:20:11] ramsin50: i hope he gets fired that would more drama
[2:20:16] Reclaiming: if cordwood loses his job PD is cooked
[2:20:18] RadiantOrbit: hopefully he looses the job and max give him BCSO
[2:20:20] LogicWeasel: either way, it's a made for TV event today
[2:20:22] condor2104: Ruth will be there, therefore he is getting the axe
[2:20:22] LogicWeasel: his review
[2:20:27] zoeypeach: Cornwood not getting fired, I'll be shocked if he does
[2:20:28] slight621: He has to get fired so that Slacks and Ruth can say there is consistency within the PD
[2:20:30] VH_KRIEG: BONK
[2:20:31] chmbrs: this must be ruth
[2:20:32] theblackdog808: If he gets fired it's gonna get interesting

[2:20:42] DaCrazyHun: its crazy that ruth has no accountability
[2:20:43] xypher85: BRO SHUT THE FUCK UP, DEAN IS NOT EVEN SEEING YOU 󠀀
[2:20:43] riiftzzz: Ssaab has said that if Cornwood is respectful in the meeting he will vote to keep his job

[2:20:48] Floo94: whens the meeting?
[2:20:49] JakeStratic: Before the mayor 90% lose. After the mayor 55/45 lose. Capts want to double down but might go for self preservation... but I think Capts like Ruth knows shes probably gone anyways, so might as well double down on Cornman
[2:20:50] girlballor: i cant imagine they are going to drop the second biggest viewer streamer from the pd but that would be bold
[2:20:51] amanmama: Is the chat good now mods?
[2:20:52] LoxKR: max said to cornwood today that if he gets fired he will pull strings and reinstate him tho

[3:53:27] T00SCHWIFTY: The main difference between a deputy sheriff and a police officer is jurisdiction. A police officer is solely responsible for the prevention of crime within their city limits, whereas a deputy sheriff is responsible for an entire county, which could include multiple small towns and several larger cities.

[7:20:26] MDM4ever1986HD: @TyleriumGaming cheever7
[7:20:30] KjetilHestvik: yeah pd is really killing rp with all this interest in all the drama
[7:20:41] Luthercorpz: @danielb2705 Nah it's kinna both but mainly it's just HC in RP snaking everyone they want to stay in power an do what they want. Not the mayor, not crane, not council. HC PD think they are the 4th an total branch of government.
[7:20:42] espeiranza: ditective time xd
[7:20:48] lordfartofglittergord: this is the first time that non pd rp is the best with the current structure as a watcher
[7:20:57] st3adyguy: I think it's sad that they are not content with firing, they really wanna push for charge to disbar him

[7:21:34] MDM4ever1986HD: Aziz is cooked
[7:21:35] SpiritEX: xdd hes collecting daps for the shot civilian
[7:21:37] P51F144: @MDM4ever1986HD drama frogs are tho
[7:21:39] Luthercorpz: PD might as well declare a war an take over the city again because thats exactly where we are anyways. End 3.0 rerun
[7:21:42] TyleriumGaming: How is it going @Deansocool
[7:21:45] MDM4ever1986HD: @P51F144 Yeah 100%
[7:21:53] BigDutchBag: hes getting a possible murder charge for it
[7:22:10] KjetilHestvik: i never mentioned him, its many channels popping off these days with all this pd drama
[7:22:16] smpies: Good luck to that when there are pd act xdd
[7:22:18] vicious_pen: yeah they're literally spending this time arranging a felony charge for cornwood

[7:22:32] Janman88: i feel bad for saabs or esfands chat - people go fearal NotLikeThis

[7:22:42] MDM4ever1986HD: @Janman88 100%
[7:22:42] v3x_75: hi everyone
[7:22:47] donsson: Would Esfand still play RP if he got fired?
[7:22:49] Athasin: LUL she got his name wrong
[7:22:52] Luthercorpz: @vicious_pen far worse than a felony charge lol
[7:22:55] JakeStratic: @Luthercorpz True, biggest issue is PD capts are suppose to be non-corruptible characters and RP'ing as corrupt isn't acceptable as a result. People have to aim at Incompetent. But TBH I don't think the capts realize they're corrupt in rp
[7:22:57] MDM4ever1986HD: @v3x_75 peepoHey
[7:22:58] icephrogg: sadly cornwood is done for they gonna try push criminal charges
[7:23:03] BigDutchBag: @MDM4ever1986HD basically the PD would press murder against cornwood
[7:23:04] nuuskis2: @Janman88 yeah did you see the pin in saabs
[7:23:04] LHaxorP: hope you guys can come up with something to do till LASO if not think esfand might get bored and head to the airport and o7 4.0
[7:23:07] Tcmasterzzz: BEcome NPC
[7:23:09] macneutron: Funny how the pushing of charges is coming from the HC of one shift
[7:23:11] jessielight: Start a Law and Investigative Firm and do the job the cops arent doing in the pd
[7:23:13] Warrcus: I hope this is all like planned lol. Like offline they all know the script
[7:23:16] jefe_jay_: @Janman88 Exact reason I'm here for today. Absolute warzones over there.
[7:23:16] vicious_pen: dude fuq the PD
[7:23:17] xypher85: dean?
[7:23:17] chmod_R_777: hes not wrong tho, he learned a lot... natural born Sheriff, he must be unleashed but the city is not ready for it yet
[7:23:23] smpies: Press murder to that goodluck
[7:23:27] Crazyoldfool: the fact that they are not only going after his PD job, but are actively trying to ruin his backup plan of being lawyer because of an sbs character is actually moronic.
[7:23:34] MDM4ever1986HD: @BigDutchBag but what I'm saying DOES Ruth have authority over the mayor?
[7:23:38] Janman88: @nuuskis2 pining that shit as a mod is really stupid - thats not for the public
[7:23:39] ogbrowniettv: TIME FOR CORNWOOD CRIMINAL ARC
[7:23:45] Sacredtenshi: chat if you wanna see high command thoughts, I posted in deans meta discord

[7:23:52] Athasin: @MDM4ever1986HD Nope
[7:23:57] jy33130: Crimewood time Kappa
[7:24:08] BigDutchBag: @MDM4ever1986HD yes because they are still the acting captains. He is only a middle man for the state
[7:24:09] Janman88: if u pin a hate message only more will follow, strisand effect - what ever the hell that mod smoke
[7:24:12] MDM4ever1986HD: @Athasin That's what I wanted to hearr
[7:24:12] vicious_pen: Ruth is a dictator slacks is her jester
[7:24:12] cawood899: Id love to see them stick murder to cornwood for that...shooting a dead body...
[7:24:17] Luthercorpz: @JakeStratic You have HC unaccountable to anything in the city being as corrupt as possible with self righteous integrity shields an smiles.  They think they own the city no joke
[7:24:21] Nerex3: We suspended ? havent watched for some days
[7:24:23] MDM4ever1986HD: @BigDutchBag Oh
[7:24:35] macneutron: @Nerex3 fired
[7:24:42] Nerex3: @macneutron oh damn
[7:24:44] Call_Me_MaMo: If they basically charge cornwood with muder, that  kills his rp
[7:24:45] smpies: Dap squad
[7:24:48] Janman88: sorry other places other rules but some like that boggles me
[7:24:51] samjack007007: @Nerex3 Denzel fired. dunno about cornwood
[7:24:52] Adeelsheikhy: they can’t confirm cornwood a bullet killed him, they all shot together
[7:24:56] BigDutchBag: but they want to charge him with murder now
[7:24:57] Athasin: @MDM4ever1986HD Did you see the "Dab was right" clip from yesterday though, when she said what can they do, we have the guns
[7:24:59] voidptr01: this PD is dog shit, all 3 captains are dog shit…
[7:25:00] jwou11: Ruth and her lapdog going to get Cletus fired and maybe charged
[7:25:00] JustinBinder: captains conversation is crazy right now, and cornwood sugested aldo for commisonor
[7:25:02] Adeelsheikhy: cornwoods*
[7:25:09] MDM4ever1986HD: was this murder charge over Donald Bush XXIV?
[7:25:10] yunginnine: all i learned from cornwoods hc meeting is i dont like donald bush
[7:25:18] cawood899: @call_me_mamo you cant murder whats already dead
[7:25:18] MDM4ever1986HD: @Athasin Right

[7:25:21] macneutron: @MDM4ever1986HD yeah
[7:25:23] yunginnine: yes
[7:25:26] SecretChiley: If Cornwood gets charged with Murder, it could easily be argued everyone else who was shooting was an accessory to the murder
[7:25:29] jeremyks9: Slacks and turner both reasonable but Ruth seems to have the say
[7:25:30] AJTonyy: Cornwood PD
[7:25:37] BigDutchBag: Donald bush is the death of cornwood haha
[7:25:38] Luthercorpz: Donald Bush didnt matter. HC WERE ALWAYS GOING TO DOT HIS!
[7:25:40] Athasin: @SecretChiley Accomplice
[7:25:42] MDM4ever1986HD: @Athasin So I meant XXIII
[7:25:46] BigDutchBag: the irony
[7:25:49] MDM4ever1986HD: I meant
[7:25:50] Iamthesupport420: Need to get rehired them plant a bomb in the PD and blow everyone up including yourself.  o7
[7:25:54] P51F144: Dont care about Captin RP they are just farming Drama Frogs why they are waiting 24hrs
[7:25:59] Luthercorpz: HC have been doing this since day 1 Den, Cornwood and anyone else were snaked from the start
[7:26:07] smpies: And its self defense lol crim suspect attacked first
[7:26:15] Athasin: @MDM4ever1986HD I got you, only reason I know it so well is because I typed it so much that day
[7:26:16] BigDutchBag: you know the mayor will Pardon him

[7:26:57] Athasin: @Superhank Right next to Larry and Marty's
[7:27:00] ManakinEU: maybe its just me but it feels like they only want a certain type of character for cops
[7:27:03] Promoniks: /E COK YEP
[7:27:05] theegoomba: are you allowed to bring a perma character back? would be fucking hilariosu if they try to charge cornwood with murder then you walk into court alive
[7:27:14] BigDutchBag: cornwood being fired is the least of his worries right now
[7:27:15] Superhank: yeah the one slacks and stuff rents too
[7:27:19] bubsehh: @BeatsSaid he will learn in 24 hrs or less

[7:28:40] vicious_pen: Yooooo.. Slacks just said the caps admit Den shouldn't have been fired but they just did it as an example to everyone else
[7:28:52] Athasin: @afkbrb Nah they got ran out of the Southside by CG X
[7:29:03] angrycrumpet13: Slacks is going on about using u as an example as reasoning to keep Cornwood 😂😂😂

[7:30:54] BDG_Toa676: deansoPopcorn deansoPopcorn
[7:30:55] Athasin: I'm still reeling from from Slacks telling Den to his face, "You're not an example, that would be vindictive." to "We all agreed he was getting fired as an example."
[7:30:56] soosmaz74: they are accusing him of murder
[7:30:59] DieterK: @Deansocool esfand's kinda getting stressed about all of this man Sadge
[7:31:28] pukanacua: GotDapped
[7:31:42] mizzikk2401: yup Ruth wants to charge him with murder

[7:33:16] Athasin: @MDM4ever1986HD And then has the nerve to talk about integrity.

[7:33:57] MDM4ever1986HD: HE LOOKS sus
[7:33:59] JakeStratic: It wasn't until now that I realized how evil Ruth really is. She took so much time to take FALSE notes. Then presented them so fast no one can respond 1x1. She lied over and over. Then controlled the conversation to end at the only thing that was correct. In order to assert, everything was correct. Meanwhile, it is suppose to be RP and she isn't suppose to be corrupt.
[7:34:01] vicious_pen: @Athasin yeah that's what laid me out.  Slacks literally LIED to den's face

[7:35:28] vicious_pen: it will hurt Esfand IRL if they do this to him.  this shit isn't RP.  thsi si messed up.  Esfand did that because and RPer asked him to do an RP with him

[7:36:03] MDM4ever1986HD: I feel for Cornwood he PD does not deserve him
[7:36:06] hoanzlgoas: I think Esfand had a great time the last 2 days with RP i guess, and Mayor gonna but him into LASO if possible,so Cornwood is good

[7:38:48] JakeStratic: @Rascal_PM In a position of power. Knowingly manipulating the truth. Especially, if anything you assert is not proven true and penalizing other for that is CORRUPTION. Here is the definition of corruption - cause I don't think you understand it: "dishonest or fraudulent conduct by those in power"
[7:38:50] combattingjosh: Can she see the cop stacking in MRPD? LMFAO

[7:39:22] purplepoodle89: yesssss
[7:39:22] red_eyed_jed1: Ruth: "We can't have the people lose faith in the PD" and then lies about everything

[7:41:04] Athasin: Slacks already lied on the stand when he was asked if he thought the charges against K should've been pushed.
[7:41:14] heartsonlysoren: @JakeStratic substantive acts taken in furtherance of the intent to defraud (lie in some form) or otherwise displace duly elected or appointed government officials or institutions is another way to phrase
[7:41:18] Athasin: Dude lied on stand to back Ruth
[7:41:26] Athasin: No saving him.

[7:43:02] amptown27: i have a serious question. at what point do the powers that be realize that if most of the issues with the PD stem from Ruth which is causing people to not want to RP or do thier job. when do they address the issue of the one person for the better of the many? weather its the "character" doing it or not. it is bothering and causing issues with many. ik its a sore subject but im just asking. ik the mayor is doing the act and stuff but it just seems kinda wild

[7:44:29] danielb2705: I think you should make another Donald Bush and not press Charges on Cornwood for the murder
[7:44:40] Athasin: @amptown27 To be fair, Max is RP'd by a power that be and his made a law with Crane (another power that be) to force accountability on the PD Captains
[7:44:43] Janman88: having fun and drama and shits and giggles but this seems like its getting too big
[7:44:53] pukanacua: make turner chief of police, cornwood sheriff, problem solved

[7:44:55] chmod_R_777: next few days, NoPixel will be better drama than GoT seasons 1 - 4 PepeLaugh
[7:45:10] heartsonlysoren: @JakeStratic These charges are mostly about difficulty of evidence and intent. IRL they are purposefully broad because of the different shapes it can be, but also purposefully hard to charge because it is prone to abuse.
[7:45:15] JakeStratic: @Deansocool True - but would Den Zel read legislation?
[7:45:23] vicious_pen: I'm telling you.  you should have Den hook up with cornwood and you guys get shit done
[7:45:34] Caeros: They'rs expecting people playing a game to think through the rules people paid 100k+ with 18 years of schools make.
[7:45:38] Rascal_PM: Louise for captain IMO
[7:45:40] JustinBinder: Shiesty needs to meet max before its too late
[7:45:41] amptown27: @Rascal_PM i think that kinda misses my point. at what point is 1 person allowed to mess up RP or make people not want to RP to so many without issue. i understand Ruth says its her "character" and to a degree i get that but its a game. if you do things that make others not even wanna play is my issue
[7:45:56] Rascal_PM: @amptown27 I’m jk buddy
[7:45:57] JakeStratic: @heartsonlysoren It isn't about the charges. It is about their official statements related to the actions. Also, their intent elsewhere
[7:46:13] amptown27: i understand that completely. its just frustrating from a outside view. sorry to vent

[7:48:06] JakeStratic: @heartsonlysoren Umm. What are you arguing? I'm not debating their ability to fire. I'm debating their evidence and that they're clearly lying - in front of Cornwood, about Cornwood. Then also in OOC - they're admitting they're lying. While, they're in a position not allowed to be corrupt, when they are by definition being corrupt... which prevents RP about them being corrupt.

[7:59:23] JakeStratic: @heftylefty_prime What kills me is how Capts have made mistakes deserving daps. Or Tips & Frost forgetting to DNA a crim and then beating them in prison to get the DNA forcibly... then paying them 4001 dollars to not prosecute... That is DAP stuff - but only good officers for funny stuff are suspended
[7:59:33] thebogeym4n: My question is why do they apply daps like weeks after the incident itself
[7:59:35] catfish_quackenbush: @Luthercorpz and ruth should def be charged for the treason thing, plus many more other things

[8:03:16] Peltzi: gta 6 coming to pc in 2026
[8:03:18] SecretChiley: @smpies It'll still take time for RP servers to develop their own features. Unless GTA 6 actually has RP features integrated on launch
[8:03:22] ChoobiOne: GTA 6 will be fine on a 3070
[8:03:25] JakeStratic: GTA5 isn't about the GPU - it is about bad netcode/server settings & to much ADHOC modding

[8:07:39] Luthercorpz: She has caused all of this
[8:07:43] Luthercorpz: IN RP

[8:07:51] zombieyw: @red_eyed_jed1 Me? StinkyGlitch StinkyGlitch
[8:07:52] catfish_quackenbush: And she just so happen to have her lap dog Aldo there in the panel
[8:07:56] BigDutchBag: Ruth is going to make great RP with the Mayor
[8:07:57] JakeStratic: @Deansocool Consider RP'ing with Cornwood. PIs or paralegal. I dunno. Consider it
[8:08:03] devlin0221: Its really hard for me to not think Cheevers dislikes Esfand OOC
[8:08:12] BigDutchBag: every great story needs a villain
[8:08:35] JakeStratic: PIs isn't please. it is Private Investigator :)
[8:08:38] smpies: What do think when alot of civs crim and pd hate hef
[8:08:43] zombieyw: Yeah but not firing officers who do their jobs DarkKnight
[8:08:45] Luthercorpz: Everything I say is only in RP character wise. Anything else gets too personal.
[8:08:48] red_eyed_jed1: @zombieyw lol i would have to be psychic to have done that for you, on my screen you sent after i did KEKHeim
[8:09:03] JakeStratic: Den Zel as a P.I. might be badass. Then transitioning to Sheriffs
[8:09:06] zombieyw: LUL LUL LUL
[8:09:23] catfish_quackenbush: I really am not liking this current NP PD. Its they are really killing any "good faith" type of rp fun. I get it, they cant be like early pd 3.0, but man, this is like NO FUN PD
[8:09:44] macneutron: @devlin0221 if u have watched her stream, she is different from her character
[8:10:25] catfish_quackenbush: @macneutron yea shes atleast on stream said many times she loves esfand but he does shit her character has to push hard
[8:10:33] JakeStratic: @catfish_quackenbush Yea, fun is needed & i'm tired of "DAPS" being 80% of the Rp around Police. Before, after, & during.
[8:10:36] thebogeym4n: @macneutron Oh yeah, if anything hate the character not the streamer
[8:10:39] Luthercorpz: HC and all their old HC snrs have been corrupt from day 1 hiding behind integrity an that is why the Pd is they way it is.
[8:11:29] Luthercorpz: Beric is the only Snr I even think wants real change an hates old HC culture
[8:11:46] Iaediil: @Deansocool i think sometimes an RP choice needs to be thought about in ooc and how it effects future RP because currently alot of the PD rp from others is damaging the rest of the RP
[8:12:20] PeterPleb1992: she is LOA
[8:12:40] archie_rx7: Chatting
[8:12:43] JakeStratic: @Deansocool She can't lawyer anymore. She has to pass her cases on now - cause she is chief of staff
[8:12:49] AJTonyy: bust case
[8:12:56] JakeStratic: srry - didn't realize that was in RP
[8:13:06] DanLGG: I mean if you make a choice in character in Rp regardless of what comes from it is rp
[8:13:20] Slickrick8888: So prosponed?
[8:13:23] Jethrq: @fishiegoblublub deansoGVO

[8:13:49] JimmehOnPC: deanso4K
[8:13:51] AJTonyy: this is juicy rp tho
[8:13:52] xypher85: @fishiegoblublub relax, breathe.
[8:13:54] CallMeEnki: I just don't understand the overall vision leadership has with a PD this way tbh.
[8:14:02] papap00h: @fishiegoblublub weird she has stated its part of her character shes like the Cersei of PD
[8:14:09] zombieyw: Wait, Aziz hasn't woken up deansoHeart
[8:14:09] PeterPleb1992: i doubt anything gonna happen tbh, no one really cares enough to do anything
[8:14:41] Iaediil: i think this needs looking at ooc because the RP choices they are making is making the server not fun for the others on the server
[8:14:42] bobaflexd: I wonder if there will be a walkout when cornwood gets canned tomorrow.
[8:15:07] fishiegoblublub: @papap00h why esfand gotta lose his job tho? over a fucking joke (magdumping a body)
[8:15:07] AJTonyy: @bobaflexd protest RP 👀
[8:15:09] combattingjosh: @bobaflexd I wouldn't be surprised. It will prove Ruth wrong though.
[8:15:16] Jethrq: @Iaediil lemme contact NoPixel HQ rn MrDestructoid
[8:15:25] VioraX: shiesty having a house would be nice
[8:15:26] catfish_quackenbush: @bobaflexd there will def be some sort of either walk out or moral hit, especially on shit 2, if he is let go
[8:15:33] xypher85: if you hate someone from a movie/ show, remember its cause they can act really well
[8:15:46] bobaflexd: haha Ruth said morale was up without cornwood kekw
[8:15:50] BDG_Toa676: Woii
[8:16:04] PeterPleb1992: @bobaflexd how would she know LUL
[8:16:05] DanLGG: what if they fire Cornwood and he becomes a civilian. A martyr to the criminals and saint to civilians and a friend to the PD. There could be some amazing rp in any of those worlds
[8:16:14] xypher85: it has you guys glued and invested, if there are no bad guys in the story. it gets boring
[8:16:15] catfish_quackenbush: @bobaflexd yea saab was like wth you smoking, maybe in shift 1 haha
[8:16:22] AJTonyy: Greg on twitter 👀
[8:16:35] xypher85: so like relax on the ooc stuff
[8:16:41] BDG_Toa676: @xypher85  that poor actor for Joffrey in Got had shit tonne of hate irl 😭
[8:16:45] bobaflexd: I’m pretty sure the mayor will rehire cornwood with his new legislation
[8:17:01] JakeStratic: @bobaflexd Confusing troop morale with (people not talking negatively about Capts on large streams)... It happens.
[8:17:03] BDG_Toa676: One of the reason dude quite acting
[8:17:15] BDG_Toa676: *quit
[8:17:15] fishiegoblublub: @JakeStratic so they all signed on and spent 5 hours in a stiarwell for nothing lol
[8:17:19] catfish_quackenbush: @DanLGG my concern with this whole thing, is if they actually push criminal charges on Cornwood. Cause if he gets a felony, it ruins all his LASO and lawyer/judge arc
[8:17:20] xypher85: @BDG_Toa676 yeah lmao fucking hated joffery
[8:17:45] macneutron: Looking from a diff POV, it's very hard to find a balance in PD. if they dont punish mistakes for the sake of RP, it becomes a slippery slope. everyone will start claiming "its RP" when they f*ck up to avoid DAPs.
[8:17:50] cg4279: Omg. Don't care is happening.  It's over
[8:18:01] Triist0ne: @catfish_quackenbush he can get those charges expunged/pardoned easily imo

[9:14:55] PeterPleb1992: Ruth too chicken to leave the PD lol
[9:14:59] BDG_Toa676: deansoP deansoP
[9:15:04] ImEmanGaming: u and Ruth in cadet class lmao
[9:15:12] Janman88: PD needs one leadership and not 3 horses pulling in 5 directions
[9:15:20] catfish_quackenbush: @Janman88 yea unfortunantly, i think now that Ruth has Aldo as one of the other votes, he will do what she wants, so its going to be tough to overcome the firing
[9:15:23] ooshiecoo: Cersei didn't learn til the city was done fora
[9:15:31] Tasty_J: Ruth makes pred look amazing
[9:15:54] trinisavage6: @janman88 soza NotLikeThis
[9:15:56] PeterPleb1992: Ruth said it
[9:15:59] papap00h: Ruth needs to go full Cersei and blow up the mayors office
[9:16:04] red_eyed_jed1: they are the only ones with guns right now.....
[9:16:11] the_anti_imperialist: ruth said it lol
[9:16:13] ImEmanGaming: u knowww who said it
[9:16:13] DanLGG: that’s exactly what Ruth suggested
[9:16:15] ImEmanGaming: dean
[9:16:16] MoslayerGx: @papap00h That would be wild
[9:16:17] catfish_quackenbush: @Tasty_J i miss early 3.0. BIg C, Wrangler, and Pred, awesome RP
[9:16:17] Promoniks: I hope they get fucked by the state
[9:16:17] ImEmanGaming: lmaooo
[9:16:20] Pop_pop_007: Ruth did
[9:16:28] BDG_Toa676: Wowee
[9:16:29] AbsolFC: @deansocool DEANNOOOOOOOOOOOO moosetSus
[9:16:30] yungnams: Comparing ruth to Cersei is accurate
[9:16:38] Janman88: @catfish_quackenbush yeah thats just reworking hirachy
[9:16:55] ElephantFeetTV: Xavier is played by itsgenovah. Really good rp recently
[9:16:57] keemotherapi: bro aint getting his job back
[9:16:59] trinisavage6: wabsol
[9:17:04] JakeStratic: You know what is crazy? Ruth is corrupt & vindictive. Meanwhile, Slacks is the actual problem. While, you call me a shorty & the PD refuses to talk to the mayor. ADHD leading the charge
[9:17:05] DanLGG: or shoot someone an extra bullet for Sam Baas type shit
[9:17:10] AbsolFC: deansoFro
[9:17:12] ruttdog21: WABSOL
[9:17:13] bbbrabbit123: That's why Max is looking for that announcement that I believe it was Ruth that created it.
[9:17:15] Janman88: all of PD how is going along with the vibes atm are kinda bound to do it or get the boot, dont think it counts for much
[9:17:21] Janman88: who*
[9:17:22] catfish_quackenbush: @ElephantFeetTV thanks!
[9:17:29] TheGigglePus: @tsalh thanks for the gifted!
[9:17:45] longhorns2565: inb4 cpts make an sop to make it rap worthy to arrest them if not found guilty
[9:18:02] wolfgang_86: Oh yeah that mdt stuff seems to be a key thing he is trying to get. That ruth stated
[9:18:07] Tasty_J: @catfish_quackenbush fr tho they made a hardcore cop funny and played into the part. Ruth fires more of her own subordinates than actually catches criminals
[9:18:24] BDG_Toa676: @jakestratic shorty is just a name for chicks cuh it's also for young folks
[9:18:32] BDG_Toa676: *just not
[9:18:51] plazmight: Den for commish
[9:19:10] DanLGG: yeah you can’t blame the cops for following PD. they have no choice but to do what the captains say. Denzel would fall in line
[9:19:21] Dr_Epica: Den talking to Aziz in a coma DonoWall
[9:19:36] DisConfused: Sorry was walking the dogs
[9:19:56] AbsolFC: @Deansocool i gave kloud his stuff
[9:20:00] Superhank: was that ramos? monkaW
[9:20:04] DisConfused: about to have Cyber Security Class RIPBOZO
[9:20:07] Tasty_J: he would fire Ruth instantly
[9:20:08] DanLGG: yes
[9:20:09] JakeStratic: @BDG_Toa676 I'm a 37 year old combat vet. So, guess what. I ain't a shorty. I know what it means and it is very disrespectful to me. You go ahead and be a shorty
[9:20:12] wolfgang_86: yes
[9:20:13] bbbrabbit123: Believe me he will push it but he needs that annoucement.
[9:20:16] Janman88: thats what is going for prolly
[9:20:24] Chaoszero_goc: Did cornwood get criminal charges?
[9:20:25] longhorns2565: IN FEBRUARY?!?!? cmon dean
[9:20:37] BDG_Toa676: @jakestratic bro 😂
[9:21:13] Dr_Epica: !bitch
[9:21:13] Fossabot: "I dont care if I'm a bitch" Dean May 1, 2021
[9:21:20] JakeStratic: @BDG_Toa676 You're the one who wanted to explain it, lil bro
[9:21:24] Tasty_J: @chaoszero_goc not yet. he might or might not still
[9:21:52] BDG_Toa676: @jakestratic maybe chillout if Ruth making ya feel heated cuh
[9:21:58] docterstrange_: when is the court case?
[9:22:06] BDG_Toa676: Go for a walk or some
[9:22:36] Chaoszero_goc: Cornwood joins cgx when?
[9:22:40] DanLGG: This man’s fking addicted to rp
[9:22:41] catfish_quackenbush: what Big C talking about? what he cooking?
[9:22:43] catfish_quackenbush: oh
[9:22:45] wolfgang_86: Nice
[9:22:55] ImEmanGaming: the mayor
[9:22:57] ImEmanGaming: maybe
[9:22:58] Tasty_J: cook cornwood cook
[9:23:00] Dr_Epica: damn, calling in a favor to play RP NAH AINTNOWAY
[9:23:00] Milo_lul: city about to be on fire
[9:23:03] catfish_quackenbush: yea, hes bad off haha, almost too much
[9:23:04] Sathure: 24hr Esfand stream inc LUL
[9:23:09] ImEmanGaming: bro bout to call a unit
[9:23:17] BDG_Toa676: Oh shit
[9:23:18] longhorns2565: about to talk to the state o7 my boy cornwood
[9:23:19] ImEmanGaming: lmaoo
[9:23:22] OskisOG: @Sathure legit
[9:23:37] red_eyed_jed1: time to invest in Snr buns?
[9:23:41] ruttdog21: when can we get more world number 1 among us plays?
[9:23:48] J05l4H: He has an addiction omE2
[9:23:59] catfish_quackenbush: and i hate the fact OOC that they obvisouly see how much time and effort he puts into not just the PD, but the city, and Ruth going to punish him for some SBS shit
[9:24:20] catfish_quackenbush: Esfand is a good RPer, so hes rolling with it, but still sucks
[9:24:27] JakeStratic: @BDG_Toa676 What? where did that come from? You disagree with something i've said about miss vindictive?
[9:24:45] Tasty_J: the fact cornwood put in 170k of his own money and they just fire him like that if this goes thru?
[9:24:58] longhorns2565: that’s not the worst I heard mentioned lmao 🤣
[9:25:07] PeterPleb1992: Slacks lying about the 12 names was kinda nasty tbh
[9:25:10] papap00h: the drama has been juicy tho
[9:25:19] catfish_quackenbush: I 100% he shoudl be punished, but yea, a firing and a felony charge, that would be messed up DAMN YOU GEORGE BUSH 23Rd!
[9:25:21] ImEmanGaming: the PD on a different type of timing.
[9:25:33] Janman88: @PeterPleb1992 he legit couldnt remember and forgot
[9:25:37] BDG_Toa676: @jakestratic brudda you been yapping typing essays cuz of a char. Now you getting touchy cuz of that.
[9:25:40] Janman88: wasnt intentional but still looks bad
[9:25:44] Fossabot: If your enjoying the stream smash the DAMN follow button! I mean shit its just a click away... Might see your name on screen ;)
[9:25:53] Toluen090: The PD command is bad this time around. Shift one was pushing the firing most not even cornwoods shift.
[9:25:56] longhorns2565: I’m hoping that’s the worst but my boy they was wilding in that meeting moment he left. only a couple stood up for him in anyway
[9:25:59] PeterPleb1992: @Janman88 but he remembers now right?
[9:26:38] Toluen090: At some point they have to remember this is still a game if they want hardcore real life they need to step out of the house
[9:26:42] PeterPleb1992: @PeterPleb1992 if he remembers now and is just going to ignore it, then he doing it in bad faith imo
[9:26:50] zerzz24: omE

[9:26:59] red_eyed_jed1: lol the accent
[9:27:03] JakeStratic: @BDG_Toa676 I've noticed, you're like the Capts. You assert an opinion without fact. When asked for them you say a 'char'.
[9:27:06] ruttdog21: xdd xdd xdd
[9:27:07] catfish_quackenbush: @Toluen090 yea, i didnt watch much of late np 3.0, but man, from watching Den, Aziz, Big C, and other cops, just feels like they are way too "no bs"

[9:38:34] red_eyed_jed1: frenn Cornwood
[9:38:47] fishnchips333: like 6 officers shooting and he died later at the hospitals but somehow command knows it was that last shot for sam bass that killed him. they do forensics now

[9:40:27] Athasin: @K0dakHalfBlack Yeah either they're actually "reviewing" instead of just firing him like they did Den.
