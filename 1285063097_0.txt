[2:15:13] Zroto: I feel like the extra weird construction bit in 503 that you cant actually get into, right at the start of the hidden door area, is indicating there is another hidden entrance that leads to that locked wooden door

[3:15:40] deqobot: gotta be something COPIUM
[3:15:42] Ceryshen: it looks like it turns off an alarm though

[3:15:44] kirstarchia: 5 second prompt LUL
[3:15:45] ParaTheNormal: I think everyone needs to approach this as though they’re planning the heist.
[3:15:45] left4you12: try to blow up the two elevator motors

[3:15:55] DieselPoweredWankle: looks like the same keypad on the roof to get you to the penthouse
[3:16:10] ItsTrunzo: Does anything unlock the generators outside the room or are they just decoration?
[3:16:11] greekborn23: It turns on if there is a fire I bet

[3:16:21] twitchstolemyname: oh fire protocol
[3:16:22] twitchstolemyname: ya
[3:16:25] chemforshort: yeah it’s so weird to see a keypad placed there

[3:16:25] Nativebluntsmoker: fire exstiguisher
[3:16:27] genesis_ftw: You guys need to just run through combinations then peak everything in the casino
[3:16:32] Ryyo_: @ItsTrunzo parsec is a unit of distance not time
[3:16:33] syneesia: Can it be magneted? monkaHmm
[3:16:39] kirstarchia: Burn the Casino down
[3:16:41] xAssassin1125x: maybe need codes or something?
[3:16:42] Kyndagh: The biggest question is "What's in the offices?" I feel like
[3:16:44] ghentg: Clearly you have to use Moltovs
[3:16:45] Dies3lftw: makes sense, IRL we use fire alarms to disable locked doors to paths of egress
[3:16:47] archfey_: handaxe Kappa
[3:16:47] thetruebonobo: you put the master key into 4 peaces and dors open
[3:16:48] greekborn23: Set a fire in the actual casino
[3:16:53] Cybernethik: still think its gotta be the offices
[3:16:56] BilboBuckins: right bc that's probably a emergency exit for the generator
[3:16:57] FletchSin: @ItsTrunzo its a star wars ref
[3:16:58] TrainrRed: I bet Dr. NOPERS would've figured this out Kappa Kappa

[3:17:04] Wtfpeanuts: can you smoke it?
[3:17:06] CarolusRex521: @kyndagh the offices could be a bait
[3:17:13] jawnwick99: That's a "gotta be something" if I've ever seen one
[3:17:17] Kyndagh: @CarolusRex521 I refuse to believe DW did that
[3:17:19] beefy_tv: do the keypads beep when you hit the gens?
[3:17:21] bodestar: could the vr code be for that keypad

[3:18:03] GrogRy3: @HiddenSquid_ true.  Just light shit on fire
[3:18:04] kirstarchia: It's time to burn the gambling den down
[3:18:24] sorrybaka: read that emergency list
[3:18:26] twitchstolemyname: have they molitoved the tables =D
[3:18:27] Calvinhood1: @Terry_Pandy It shows different options, but you don't really use it to interact with things

[3:18:58] Nightbot: Warning! This stream may feature bright lights! Those with Epilepsy or have special eyes be warned.
[3:19:09] esrou: Only thing I can think of at this point is generator order
[3:19:11] Mirdath: What if you killed dean monkaHmm
[3:19:18] lord_dragox412: @Ceryshen Considering most assets are from GTAO, I'd doubt it. After all, DW turned boilers into generators because he had to work with what he had LUL

[3:19:48] DarknessUK_: Smoke grenades could be a thing? maybe it only turns on when an alarm is going
[3:19:48] chemforshort: Maybe magneting one of the power boxes on the roof will activate it?
[3:19:50] Terry_Pandy: @Terry_Pandy yeah was just trying to think if there could be something under it based on proximity or whatnot

[3:20:19] twitchstolemyname: @lord_dragox412 but there is a locked room in which that actually generator could still be and the white simmer tubes go into that through the wall

[3:20:36] Yokota777: I wonder if this would have worked better as an endurance challenge, like a gauntlet of puzzles in a predictable sequence or this style where the sequence of problem solving isn’t laid out to the teams and they have to solve it through trial and error. Something worth thinking about I guess.
[3:20:43] kirstarchia: What if the magnets are actually for the vault door itself to open? And nothing else? That's why nothing else unlocks.

[3:51:57] esrou: Or if the generators have to be hit in a certain order

[3:54:18] imaginary_banana1: @uberhaxornova this would be expensive, but have you tried all magnets before Thermites to try and overload generators. then VAR code to mags would bring certain things online?

[3:55:19] twitchstolemyname: @kirstarchia Namely because in vanilla gta I think you do that in a mission
[3:55:20] CSKo_5: what if you have to use Dean's hand to unlock the door in the generator room? Try cutting off his hand and holding it in your left pocket while doing the generators
[3:55:21] cropcircles1: but did you try the magnets and pee on them after?
[3:55:23] imaginary_banana1: @uberhaxornova this is sadge bro I'm praying for you guys

[3:55:33] twitchstolemyname: @kirstarchia so like the code might already be there
