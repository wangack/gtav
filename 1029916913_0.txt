[4:11:26] KennyWolf: From your knowledge
[4:11:28] SiiiilverSurfeeeer: pepeW
[4:11:29] sapeur: in the end its the crims who have the gun to the hostage so dont they have all the power to leave when they want to ?
[4:11:29] syneesia: for shift 2 mainly
[4:11:31] LijeBaley: Yeah this is a lot of Shift 2 v Shift 3 stuff as they are both VASTLY different beasts
[4:11:32] OdinGodOfVictory: Its your call after all you were firs on the scene

[4:12:00] eiightbiitt: get the Lenny special
[4:12:01] xboy199777: the problem is, different commander got different way to run a scene.
[4:12:01] jkimsleep: that's the whole point of having coverage
[4:12:02] zrialf: tbf there wass only 3 so other cops may have thought a 4th could ambush as well
[4:12:04] yeadrose: too many cops has been gettin shot lately is all mane. i guess tensions r super high n officers want to b vry aggressive for banks
[4:12:08] syneesia: barry knows the crim suffering
[4:12:10] SiiiilverSurfeeeer: ppOverheat
[4:12:16] Mr_Michel: Its Just a difference in policing thats why there is always internal clashing in the pd
[4:12:16] un_noiire: depends on the characters you encounter i guess. if it's the littlemens it would be not so extreme tbh
[4:12:17] rocket_s6: Cycle of aggression sucks, but make sure to never break the cycle of aggression
[4:12:18] HASHlSH: how long u been a cop?
[4:12:18] 3spada_Grande: I think you read the room right but your also always talking about correct procedure

[4:13:05] quodPANTHEUM: Idk the hypothetical was literally out-of-the-question hyperbolic.
[4:13:05] FleetAdmiralPepper: Expecting and trying to counter the expectation is a win mentality.

[4:13:44] Grobyc117: @minty_squinty nah not OOC higher ranked officers decide how to handle stuff
[4:13:45] Nightbot: Warning! This stream may feature bright lights! Those with Epilepsy or have special eyes be warned.
[4:13:46] thatcatarthur: The leverage is the hostages tho, the two guys inside wouldn’t shoot their leverage for Dundee going hella far outside of the bank. That would literally just end the situation with no one winning.

[4:14:58] xboy199777: rangers FTW
[4:15:03] jj1remix: @uberhaxornova i don’t think that that was the main takeaway. I thought it was you not taking primary and telling everyone what to do and making sure everyone was ready

[4:19:08] k1lluaBug: I think others have dealt with extreme situations so they are just giving the pointers
[4:19:09] ASomewhatLargeBabyRhino: Considering hostages get treated like mechanics some times, it seems to be a good thing to value them more
[4:19:12] HornetTV: Do you think just telling him whether the heli was a news heli or not would have been a better result?
[4:19:12] Grimm420: obviously you need to get on the pd program and not give a shit about hostages
[4:19:12] Juaner930: barry always makes the cops look good
