[0:33:19] Bruno530: that shit would take a month to decorate omE
[0:33:20] kurtydeee: you could build some kind of facade since the editor works outsite of buildings
[0:33:24] rockstrmental1ty: bro imagine the devs went brazy with a system for changing exterior details like the furniture system. that'd be wild
[0:33:31] brikbeans: drop in from roof like tom cruise.
[0:33:33] luckerooni: it'd be crazy if you had this fitted into a parking garage that was like a valet area
[0:33:38] sykikLive: nah cyd will never be workin for anyone else if u buy that place
[0:33:43] rockstrmental1ty: since the signs are decals it may be possible
