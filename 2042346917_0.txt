[0:25:04] drshagnastyy: it encourages higher investments for longer periods of time

[0:46:55] cdorn420: 10 percent return is actually good money
[0:47:11] nick_dr1ft: @thylootgoblin ye ott has a decent portfolio in the US
[0:47:12] ObscureMyth: crazy good return
[0:47:21] LLC00LJ007: What's the risk of loss? Percentage?
[0:47:38] nick_dr1ft: 10% in 5 weeks irl would be nuts LUL LUL
[0:48:01] nick_dr1ft: @LLC00LJ007 literally 0 for the investor
[0:48:01] LuckyCharmsForBreakfast: taxes
[0:48:06] doktou: and dont forget the taxes
[0:48:34] nick_dr1ft: they should now be able to get the taxes rebated from the government
[0:48:39] RisKkeyy: Makes too much sense, must be a scam lol
[0:48:41] LuckyCharmsForBreakfast: I need to find me a ott irl
[0:48:50] fishslayer24: The reason it seems too good to be true is because in reallife there is risk that the property value will go down, here there is only up
[0:49:21] LuckyCharmsForBreakfast: @fishslayer24 true
[0:49:40] fishslayer24: like 0 risk 10% roi in real life, everyone would be tossing every dollar they had into that, no risk is key
[0:50:03] nick_dr1ft: @fishslayer24 exactly, here the only risk is if they can find occupants
[0:51:08] nick_dr1ft: F
[0:51:17] BiGGHydro: It was getting juicy
[0:51:18] sub_ohmu: OTT professional yapper XD
[0:51:38] dallyied: K has had like 6-7 people ask about rent to own, so its perfect for right now.
[0:51:39] SubDemon: OTT knows how the business works

[0:51:51] fishslayer24: The only thing that makes it seem not so appealing is the fact that you can go make 1k at snr buns in 30 min, which is how much you are offering them for 10k over 5 weeks lol
[0:51:59] ItsEdBoi_: Getting the investors rolling is gonna be the hard part, rent to owns will fly in
[0:52:06] Hey_its_Mady: OTT know a lot about this so he can pitch this idea to anyone
[0:52:14] nerf406: I know Dab wanted a Goverment House     Maybe the state can make a 1 time large investment to get it going
[0:52:15] nick_dr1ft: ye ye, dont think it will be a problem either, main problem will be finding enough money to do all of the "Rent to Own"s that people want
[0:52:18] drshagnastyy: when more businesses start opening up and people need a place to keep their benches that multiple people can access you will get more people interested as well
[0:52:24] fishslayer24: the economy kinda fucked, its like asking a lawyer to invest 10k for 1k return when he could go make a phone call and make 1k in 30 min
[0:52:43] LLC00LJ007: Word of mouth and first investors brag about easy money made, growth will follow 👍
[0:52:48] BombataTV: @Hey_its_Mady he do this think IRL
[0:52:48] ghostman16: TwitchConHYPE TwitchConHYPE
[0:52:48] fishslayer24: yeah yeah the ratio just makes it un appealing
[0:53:06] stupadso: yeah. the unattractive part for investors is that it’s not liquid part. 5 weeks is a long time to have money tied up.
[0:53:08] fishslayer24: snr buns is just bad
[0:53:09] nick_dr1ft: @fishslayer24 but if it is that easy to make 1k they would also invest more than 10, so don't see the problem
[0:53:12] og_mo0dieh: hit it gomeh
[0:53:12] fishslayer24: tldr
[0:53:24] Nzlaten: I mean with that logic you could just rob some mofos in the street chyat it's about the RP and opportunity to make more money down the line
[0:53:24] LuckyCharmsForBreakfast: better than making no money sitting in the bank
[0:55:37] nick_dr1ft: @LuckyCharmsForBreakfast yeah but with the drip feed of things to spend money on in the server, I can understand it
[0:56:23] nick_dr1ft: everyone wants the rent to own, but not invest LUL bit of a pattern i'm seeing

[1:33:05] TheEoas: he literally ran around talking to everyone
[1:33:09] Fatass_Drew: k has the gift of gab LUL
[1:33:10] sub_ohmu: You can send people the REIT contract
[1:33:12] IMW_Survivor: so whats your next big purchase? the packer or something else?
[1:33:13] sub_ohmu: It helped out
[1:33:18] Entropystachio: i was thinking about it and was wondering how many investors you're hoping to get, because i can't imagine you'd get but a few
[1:33:18] zypher01: The REIT sells itself really. Guaranteed 10% return that increases as you reinvest
[1:33:38] sub_ohmu: They can read along as then listen to the pitch
[1:33:43] RagRanger: he was emphasizing that they’re contractually guaranteed to get a 10% ROI and their principal back after 5 weeks
[1:33:46] zZEROo77: K has that silver tongue
[1:33:50] doktou: you should put a cap on the reinvestment percentage
[1:33:53] marizeus: we missed you in the city gomey
[1:33:55] ItsEdBoi_: Only problem is ppl in the city not knowing a guaranteed 10% return is amazing
[1:34:00] stupadso: the key is people that aren’t spending money on server racks lol
[1:34:09] Azzarill: K could sell sand in a desert lol
[1:34:27] marizeus: thought we lost you to pokemon
[1:34:41] 3xevilx: 10% irl is amazing, 10% in rp is not so much unfortunately
[1:34:42] nick_dr1ft: @ItsEdBoi_ well that is only if you invest a lot
[1:34:44] Kdkuiper: @zypher01 yeah for sure, but people only hear i only make $1k when i invest $10k
[1:35:00] nick_dr1ft: and in the city 5 weeks is a loong time
[1:35:21] marizeus: fair fair. good to see gomey back
[1:35:24] stupadso: well it’s fine in rp. its not being liquid for 5 weeks that’s not amazing.
[1:35:28] ItsEdBoi_: @ItsEdBoi_ 10% is 10%, it just seems better when u put more in
[1:35:33] Bmex11: but this is real life not RP so 10% is still amazing KappaLUL
[1:35:34] dallyied: I hate that fact too, I wish people rp
[1:35:40] dallyied: rp
[1:35:41] RagRanger: talk to people in the courthouse who understand documents and tell ‘em Siobhan wrote it
[1:35:49] Kdkuiper: 5 weeks in RP is like half a year IRL haha
[1:36:00] 3xevilx: how much does a server rack and all the gpu's to fill it cost?
[1:36:01] tayno_90: K went super had mode yesterday
[1:36:08] RagRanger: talking to all these people is good RP anyway
[1:36:09] BiGGHydro: It's ok if you got an extra 10k laying around but if you broke af na...
[1:36:11] dallyied: I wish rp'd that money investing was actually a good thing in a way.

[1:37:37] stupadso: just need to host another date auction lol. free 80k.
[1:37:44] doktou: k was lucky also because he stayed at the bank and people kept coming in so it was easy to sell
[1:37:56] yoshiebandit: k is just super good at getting money from people it is actually insane
[1:38:01] 3xevilx: 40k for a server butcoin would have to be worth less than $60, 50k is less than $70 for this investment to be worth it
[1:38:05] nick_dr1ft: people dont have enough to invest for them to feel that the 10% over 5 weeks is worth
[1:38:06] itzjoshyboy18: Ye but carnt afford the house to buy first
[1:38:20] nerf406: Rent to buyers need to understand they have to invest first to get the ball rolling
[1:38:26] xmurderapolisx: k has like 4 rent to owns in line now he just needs investors
[1:38:30] nick_dr1ft: @yoshiebandit ye, but he is still nowhere near close enough to buying vinny's house tho
[1:38:33] tayno_90: Rent yo own is hard because have to have capital up front first to buy the house
[1:38:54] 3xevilx: no one has the capitol yeah
[1:38:58] suijay: be nice if the state could give k some money lol
[1:39:03] nerf406: Investors Priority RTO que
[1:39:05] Azzarill: Only way the rent thing works if they let you use gov cash then pay them back like the old loan stuff ?
[1:39:15] stupadso: once you get that first rent to own you get $30k or so a week in rent from that so it starts to snowball.
[1:39:20] nick_dr1ft: every 1 rent to own, requires a minimum of 20 people that want to invest
[1:39:48] Bmex11: you guys as a whole need to have enough money to buy houses and not have to ask people to invest, when you guys reach that point money will truly start coming in and since you guys start doing rent to own you don't have to worry for furniture
[1:39:51] ItsEdBoi_: U guys really need to mix in some rentals as well cause that will be permanent ownership to you, rent to own is great but not for long term sustainability
[1:39:54] tayno_90: Need to get that one building to turn it into a cop apartment hq
[1:40:14] nick_dr1ft: and K spent like 2-3 hours to get like 5 or 6 so going to be a grind in the start
[1:40:29] 3xevilx: rent to own is peanut money compared to buying and renting it out
[1:40:31] zZEROo77: Definitely need a spreadsheet to keep track of all the investors
[1:40:34] nick_dr1ft: but hopefully it works out in the long run
[1:40:37] zypher01: @ItsEdBoi_ Rentals are more headache than they are worth once they have a lot of capitol. Then rent to own will be better for them
[1:40:45] nick_dr1ft: @zZEROo77 yup agreed
[1:40:58] ItsEdBoi_: @Bmex11 exactly once they get enough profit to buy 1 house outright thats all profit to them
[1:41:17] 3xevilx: could try, most are putting it into a house/servers now tho
[1:41:29] nick_dr1ft: group 6 and the courthouse are sitting on stacks i bet

[1:42:05] ItsEdBoi_: @ItsEdBoi_ true but in the long run if they only do rent to own they wont have any passive income its all capped income based on the contracts
[1:42:13] bigfoot7802: @3xevilx unless they default then its a nice payday
[1:42:23] nick_dr1ft: @ItsEdBoi_ going to be almost impossible with the margins they are running rn
[1:42:23] Keiling1401: most people were only doing 10k too, gotta find the oil princes
[1:43:09] 3xevilx: @3xevilx except K is doing rent to own for people he likes first and would never do that to them
[1:43:11] ItsEdBoi_: @ItsEdBoi_ on vinnys house they will make 33k profit, with investors at 10%
[1:43:30] zZEROo77: Hopefully K is keeping track of who and how much was invested
[1:43:31] ItsEdBoi_: and that was a good deal for the homie
[1:43:52] bigfoot7802: @3xevilx the only one would be Vinny. He already said that
[1:43:54] ItsEdBoi_: @zZEROo77 he has all the contracts on the phone
[1:44:30] Dk_raz: I think you need something like 300k investment funds so you can afford buy properties easily, but with 10k minimum investments it will be hard
[1:44:36] bhudiekhal: o no not the powerwashing...u r cruel

[2:14:19] ItsEdBoi_: 25-35% based on the length
[2:14:49] WallyWeaver: should be 0 % tax aswel because its a REIT
[2:15:05] ItsEdBoi_: ^^^^ yea idk how that kicks in
[2:15:57] Dillz213: Tax legislation is being worked on
[2:16:19] WallyWeaver: well if 90% of the property is brought with investors you dont have to pay tax on it
[2:17:42] ItsEdBoi_: @WallyWeaver cool so thats on purchase tax? wasnt sure if it was more aimed on like weekly property tax if that comes around
[2:17:52] 8R00KS: Vinny did 20%
[2:18:03] MissinMyTeeth: vinny did 20%
[2:18:07] fiction12211: yeah Vinny did 55k down which is nice

[2:18:22] Hey_its_Mady: Didn't vinny say he paid 55k down
[2:18:27] WallyWeaver: yeah they should get reimbursed by the state if its a REIT property
[2:18:45] ItsEdBoi_: Niceee so even more profit
[2:18:50] imthefrog: should ask if there is a liquidation clause in the agreement, if you change the locks do you have the right to liquidate the belongings of the home?
[2:18:52] gaddy7070: k already has a 100 k or more amd thats with vinny's down payment

[2:23:22] ItsEdBoi_: Think it should be base 25% 20% was for the homie
[2:23:32] WallyWeaver: @Timmac  use should be able to get payed back from the state for the tax beacuse its a REIT  agreement
[2:23:40] sub_ohmu: price*.2+Price
[2:23:40] ItsEdBoi_: 1+ the %
[2:23:41] cheddarbob812: x1.2
[2:23:44] nova_rubio: 1.2 is the 20% added
[2:23:49] ItsEdBoi_: % is a decimal
[2:23:56] imthefrog: cell divided by 100?
[2:23:56] ItsEdBoi_: 20% = .2
[2:23:59] Hey_its_Mady: 0.2
[2:24:03] sub_ohmu: L11*N11+L11
[2:24:04] Nzlaten: Multiply it by the whole number then add it to the number you get
[2:24:14] francewon_: should just be able to multiply 1.2
[2:24:21] nova_rubio: More the percent sign two to the left and that’s where the decimal belongs
[2:24:23] ItsEdBoi_: 1+the %
[2:24:49] CrasH_CTB: @Timmac 20%/100=0.2
[2:25:01] ItsEdBoi_: Wll thats gonna be the total

[2:26:04] ItsEdBoi_: Would be easier to make a markup column so u can see the total price and then base math off that column
[2:26:48] genericusernameuno: When you calculate the 10% to investors where's the money coming from unless you add like 40% to the overall mark up?

[2:28:58] ItsEdBoi_: Both work
[2:29:08] P1_Pookie: just make markup column decimal format instead of percent

[2:30:22] Caustic_Raven: biotoxzWave
[2:30:28] ItsEdBoi_: think 25% is the right markup, OTT told u they are locked in for 275k total
[2:31:42] Manse06: hey Timmac, does the profit margins take into account a 10-12% investor payback?

[2:31:50] sub_ohmu: You need to subtract the downpayment
[2:31:52] ItsEdBoi_: U need a remaining payment column that subtracts the down payment
[2:32:17] Hey_its_Mady: ^^
[2:33:00] NinoVrd: -Q11
[2:33:16] TheTacticalDonut: or just do that in the background of the payment per week column
[2:33:54] PetsBtw: You need the Excel mousepad cx
[2:33:54] genericusernameuno: So how are you going to pay the investors back their money plus 10% within 5 weeks if you're letting the renters pay over 15?
[2:34:02] ItsEdBoi_: Its kinda annoying iirc, worry about it later tbh
[2:34:19] sub_ohmu: =TODAY()
[2:34:22] MrPRabbit: =Today() ??
[2:34:30] vixopen: =today()

[2:35:37] Morph_: weeks remaining instead?
[2:35:59] sub_ohmu: Don't forget to subtract the down payment from the mark up price before you divide by the weeks

[2:37:53] TheTacticalDonut: still need to subtract the downpayment
[2:38:13] TheTacticalDonut: well it won't always be the same
[2:38:16] 8R00KS: markup - down / weeks
[2:39:13] sub_ohmu: You have a column that calculated the money down, just need to change the payment per week formula
[2:39:56] Hey_its_Mady: You already have a money down column
[2:40:58] ItsEdBoi_: 25 was the vinny rate
[2:41:04] ItsEdBoi_: could charge others more

[3:27:37] TheTacticalDonut: 10k is minimum if that's not clear
[3:27:44] EvanEvin: put in more than 10k
[3:27:57] TRxPraetorx: This business model would work way better in an economy more bloated with capital
[3:28:53] nick_dr1ft: this is exactly why rn, they can never collect the 20+ investors for a single house, especially for vinny which they wont make barely anything on
[3:29:08] nick_dr1ft: idea is kind of shaky with the econ. of it
[3:29:14] Nzlaten: Huh
[3:29:26] EvanEvin: e's a broke ass lolsh

[3:32:10] dejus12: I thought there was 2 rental spaces left in the house by main house
[3:32:10] nick_dr1ft: @Nzlaten no not by their math on rent-to-own right now
[3:32:13] GamerGoat007: This in game wealth really means everything
[3:32:38] outsideinsiders: a higher percentage “mark-up” should be considered on the rent to own considering how many people are interested. maybe 27-30 🤔
[3:32:48] nick_dr1ft: the down payment is meant to be used for all of the investor payback every week since rent wont cover
[3:33:07] Nzlaten: @nick_dr1ft not in your math lol. It's only the profit if the renter goes awol and misses payment
[3:33:24] TheTacticalDonut: south side grove it's darkened?
[3:33:34] hunter14119: Just become a politician and print money easy clap lmao
[3:33:35] TRxPraetorx: @Timmac This is kind of a long shot, but do you think you guys could get Dab and the government to give you guys a grant via investment as a way to provide "Affordable housing"
[3:33:39] nick_dr1ft: @Nzlaten yeah but they wont do that to vinny, they already said
[3:33:45] ItsEdBoi_: Gotta start saying we have a list of rent to owners already, really need investors to kick off the snowball effect
[3:34:13] nick_dr1ft: @TRxPraetorx probably best bet right now
[3:34:31] nick_dr1ft: @TRxPraetorx and then set it up as a long term loan
[3:34:59] EvanEvin: you can't do rent to buy unless you have a capitol poll to buy the homes, so the investors are crucial.  Rent to buy is selling itself
[3:35:03] TRxPraetorx: Plus it helps get people out of the apartments
[3:35:11] nick_dr1ft: @ItsEdBoi_ people still dont feel that the kick-back is high enough since they will only invest 10k
[3:36:15] EvanEvin: maybe pay the 10% upon investment, and only keep the money for 3 weeks?

[3:36:51] drissical: A little self investing
[3:36:52] BayneGaming: like gomer been doing lol
[3:36:54] ItsEdBoi_: If u can really reimburse the taxes then u can raise the investors cut
[3:36:59] BayneGaming: pouring money in
[3:37:08] ItsEdBoi_: thats like an extra 20k per house of wiggle room
[3:37:13] mmajeter2: Seems like OTT is giving the company back end versus selling the 10% value, regardless of what they are putting in
[3:37:40] outsideinsiders: it’s trash. really need to finish them with clever messaging. and try and not get into the #s LUL
[3:37:54] KluBBa86: get ramee to invest

[3:38:38] 5wuu19: timmacTAG bouseGreatest
[3:38:40] hunter14119: Honestly maybe do 10% / 4 weeks and it might work
[3:39:48] outsideinsiders: @hunter14119 that’s still very unappealing… yet it puts EVEN more pressure on K, OTT and gomer to try and cover the expense out their own pockets
[3:39:58] nick_dr1ft: @hunter14119 still a long time to only make 1k no?
[3:41:05] KluBBa86: yes kinda but how would you make 10% while not doing anything anywhere ells?
[3:41:06] nick_dr1ft: you already have the down-payment in hand so wont effect the first house
[3:41:06] hunter14119: It is but in a month people might know what they want to do with it VS 5 weeks
[3:41:33] nick_dr1ft: @KluBBa86 not % wise, but making 1k in the city takes max 1 hour
[3:41:38] outsideinsiders: no way around it. y’all need to be making money by other means to get this ship afloat
[3:41:42] Vectishonor: Weekly payments will carry you tho
[3:41:48] KluBBa86: + no one is saying you have to invest 10k you could invest 100k if you want to

[3:44:31] nick_dr1ft: how much is a packer run? do we know?
[3:44:36] ItsEdBoi_: Need the big hitters with actual business minds
[3:44:43] hunter14119: Cops probably don't want to own in the South side

[3:45:26] MetalicJive: Packer is around 4kish? I think that's what someone said last night/earlier @nick_dr1ft

[3:45:35] H4MM4R: Thought it was next wed?

[3:48:12] 5wuu19: Piano  🎵🎵🎵

[3:51:39] nick_dr1ft: he was able to get investers by saying they get the 10 then 12,14,16,18% return every time
[3:51:43] DomDory: yo
[3:52:01] killogic916: OTT hasnt said that it gors 12-14-16-18 at all
[3:52:26] ItsEdBoi_: Need to be like money break points
[3:52:29] nick_dr1ft: @killogic916 yup, but that was how K sold it to everyone yesterday and it was working
[3:53:00] nick_dr1ft: also for them to hit the 18% that would be 25 weeks LUL
[3:53:06] ItsEdBoi_: Once they at 20% u prob wont need to offer reinvestments
[3:53:07] killogic916: they just dont get increased % on new investments, only reinvestments
[3:53:07] hunter14119: In 2 months you all won't need investments you will have enough money
[3:53:09] nick_dr1ft: should be good to selffund by then
[3:53:34] nick_dr1ft: they will never hit the 14,16 or 18%
[3:54:19] ItsEdBoi_: I like the u need to keep the same initial investment, for the increases just dont disclose that
[3:54:26] nick_dr1ft: that is a good selling point since 18% with like 40k is good returns
[3:55:22] ItsEdBoi_: it says so on and so forth in the contract its vague enough to work
[3:55:29] nick_dr1ft: it'll be 15 weeks until they even unlock the 16% LUL
