[2:53:24] CAYKE__: stuff was just getting shoved places
[2:53:25] vegasbrent: Is there enough space behind the kitchen that it could be a storage room to open back up that area katesPlot
[2:53:28] if0rg0t2remember: why do the stairs need to be in the nook at all?
[2:53:41] CozyTeaSipper: doubles as a table, which nobody is using
[2:54:09] CAYKE__: making your own kitchen would be so expensive, but the storage would be so nice.
[2:54:13] kangg: need to load up some sims 4 to unwind from the ocd of the house lol
[2:54:23] if0rg0t2remember: everything sitting just outside the nook could be in the nook like a little cozy space
[2:54:27] shadow_walker_2: it also saves space if its in a corner i think
[2:55:28] if0rg0t2remember: and put the locked door on the first landing instead of upstairs

[2:56:33] GenuineMind: I see only 1 solution.... Fireman's pole.
[2:56:45] CozyTeaSipper: The best are use for the space under stairs is putting the next stairs there. Sue, one would need to circle back, but it sure saves area.
[2:56:46] Crafty_Crystal: only really need a locked door to the bottom level, right?
[2:56:54] KarnEvil: is there an option for a ladder instead of stairs? katesGiggle
[2:57:00] Insaif: If you did the bedrooms on the middle floor and the crafting/crime on the bottom floor, would you still need a locked door on the top of the first floor stairs?
[2:57:13] kangg: fire poles or slides
