[5:13:14] HeisenSwag: ALL left turns are bad KEKW
[5:13:23] MommaPharma: dont cross yellow lines and see
[5:13:26] Bluez28: I bet it's because you keep going in the other lane on left turns
[5:13:26] puddinfox98: Pay attention to the lines on the road. You keep crossing them when turning
[5:13:27] ventingalpaca: all left turns

[5:13:39] alfano06: can’t cross lanes of travel
[5:13:39] Whezyk_: Forgot who
[5:14:01] BoavaNet: I think the idea is the server registers you in a different position while you're turning left so it thinks you are crossing over to the other lanes
[5:14:02] HeisenSwag: @puddinfox98 Keep in mind this is a custom script. I dont think that can determin what kind of textures youre crossing
