[5:44:10] TossedOnion: This reminds me of game mechanics that prolongs your ingame time TPFufun
[5:44:12] kalas_god: theres a small change you get a dongle, from a house, an even smaller change t oget a laptop since theres probabally 30 people qued up for a laptop, which ranges from 1- 10 hours. then if its your first time doing a bank, you know nothing, so its just a time waste
[5:44:14] FluffyChops1: crime line sounds like a TV show lol

[5:45:56] koffsyrup: house next to the fishing spot
[5:46:09] Niney_Who: YOu don
[5:46:11] Jaagrat01: Previous method was 20 people in a room competing to click the fastest for 1 laptop per tsunami, its this method atleast gives option
[5:46:11] Actual_Nicotine: Or maybe on planned
[5:46:12] Herzition: FeelsDankMan

[5:46:55] Dubll: when you finally get the job you have a sense of pride and accomplishment
[5:46:59] VenilyDawly: if anything it benefits larger groups since they would get more of the required items, non-tryhards would def suffer more
[5:47:00] ImToreos: And it creates no opportunity to build  a cool/entertaining getaway, since you are the mercy of the laptop email time, its a crunch once you get your hands on it
[5:47:03] Pepsiguy2009: crime is still down bad KEKLEO they probably still rolling out crime this long into 3.0 KEKLEO uhnS

[5:50:26] Niney_Who: I feel like this would be greatly fixed if fucking Laptops didn't decay in 5 hours
[5:50:30] Lovehaus: then the laptop lasts plenty of time to come up with complicated gonzo plans

[5:50:47] six_o_nine: did ya guys cooked today?
[5:50:57] Actual_Nicotine: @Sleepwalkerw if you know it's not your crew, you can reliably guess it's another crew. Only 3 crews doing it right now.
[5:51:02] Pepsiguy2009: @six_o_nine no they did not
[5:51:05] raisinpuff55: yeah if laptops were like electronic kits then all things would be good but laptop decays and there is nobody that can fix that shit

[5:51:13] Yokota777: It took X yesterday almost 23 hours to just have 1 of the 4 other people he had waiting for a laptop on the list. It takes a crazy amount of time and luck. BibleThump NotLikeThis
[5:51:29] drew_sixx: Sitting simulator 2021
[5:51:40] Actual_Nicotine: @Sleepwalkerw so if you suspect one crew is hoarding it, you can go after them to get it, or tail them etc
[5:51:42] SuperVegito44: Did we find out how long the poison lasts or if it stacks?
[5:51:43] Niney_Who: If Laptops didn't decay in 5 hours, and instead took like 7-10 days, then the Rush to get them wouldn't exist, so therefore it could be an easier-to-obtain commodity.

Even if it’s on a bike a ton of things can go wrong. The deck is already stacked against the criminals.

[5:57:32] Yokota777: @actual_nicotine Cheese in an environment where everything is stacked against criminals. I mean it’s only fair crims get one “buff” versus everything being ridiculously stacked against them. It’s almost like people want it to be flat out impossible lol.
[5:57:32] Niney_Who: @UberHaxorNova Do you think this would be alleviated slightly if Laptops lasted 7+ days? Or is this a case of needing a whole rework
[5:57:36] darkhorseman990: @borismatters  that would be a better system
[5:57:36] Sleepwalkerw: i think they are slowly rolling it out, fleccas where limited to 1 per tsunami before
[5:57:36] syneesia: NODDERS
[5:57:37] FortTehZian: @UberHaxorNova could a group with a lot of members hold down fleeca by somehow limiting laptop/dongles and sell/tax heists to others?

[5:59:02] Gullerback: it will actually make people design good plans too.. "Oh shit we got fucking harmony, lets go offroad"
[5:59:08] Riuzaku: @UberHaxorNova could an OOC limit for groups robbing banks help if the devs are too scared about too much cash on the server?
[5:59:19] hacknslash548: i think it'd be better if a group were to be assigned one instead of every individual in the group but idk how they'd implement that
[5:59:19] RoronoaZoro: I just don’t get why crime is so limited like I get cutting it down from 2.0 but now it’s hardly exist
[5:59:28] SuperVegito44: If getting a bike to outrun PD is easy, PD should just run bike pairs on patrol too. Would be pretty cool
[5:59:33] dore_gold: Bad spot, more money, good spot less money
[5:59:35] sharkczar: @Riuzaku they would have an in game limit through mechanics
[5:59:49] Actual_Nicotine: @SuperVegito44 Mack used to be a bike cop, he wants to bring it back but the budget Sadge
[5:59:57] Gullerback: 2 per tsunami
[6:00:04] Zineth57: will the meth meetings ever stop?
[6:00:06] SuperVegito44: @Actual_Nicotine Oh of course. I forgot about the budget Sadge
[6:00:18] Niney_Who: Have each bank linked to another one, so only 3 can be hit but it's still outta 6
[6:00:26] six_o_nine: a 2hs cooldown wouldn't be bad either
[6:00:37] sandoke: @UberHaxorNova What if each bank had a manager that lived by that bank. have to rob their house to get the laptop for that bank

[6:00:39] xcurryricex: LUL
[6:00:40] Riuzaku: @sharkczar, yea but the same groups would/could still hit multiple then. It seems like they don't want a single group to get too much cash too easily

[6:01:04] Yokota777: @actual_nicotine You’re already waiting possibly up to 24 hours to possibly even get a laptop yourself or someone else you know on the list. I’m not arguing that bikes aren’t more advantageous but in an environment where even getting the laptop is this difficult, having one or two things being advantageous to crims is hardly calling it too easy or something that needs to be nerfed. It’s nowhere near as accessible as it should be. I get making things difficult but not like this.
