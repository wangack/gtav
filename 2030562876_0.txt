[1:22:17] sadboykami: need devs to implement chips
[1:22:22] yureiofk: make sure dealers don‚Äôt come in with money
[1:22:23] JCerris: Maybe a chip system
[1:22:23] Full_Auto_77: if there was a way to track it easily

[1:22:28] marcoooprod: mhm and supervisors
[1:22:28] aviditi: hire a pit boss that you trust
[1:22:30] AWaltzingDingo: The one down side, using the /roll system is TRUE RANDOM, whereas casinos tend to engineer the winrate ever so slightly to always be on top. So someone doesn't get super lucky and empty them. LUL
[1:22:30] prabble: pit boss overlook?
[1:22:31] CourierV221: pit boss that watches the floor and collects before they leave
[1:22:31] mortuusintus12: all clowns as dealers haha

[1:22:35] gijn: check in like the PD that pocket wipes staff?
[1:22:36] Stepanov370: have 1 trusted cashier, use chips
[1:22:38] brikbeans: @g0styboy fanny too i hope even tho she dont know marty too long
[1:22:46] sh4gun: might just need chips then
[1:22:48] gargelon69: dont you think having 2 roulette tables is better since it will prolly make the most money.
[1:22:50] Vincheti: if only you had your own chips @omie
[1:22:50] ejayx333: pocket check before clock out
[1:22:53] fZodi: The cashier would have to keep track of how much money each dealer makes and if in the long run the numbers are weird you can fire
[1:22:54] genuscorvid: @mortuusintus12 clown themed casino? sounds like a good way to go bust
[1:22:56] CopperKat: use an item in place of chips?
[1:22:57] lily42o: Stare
[1:22:58] F__M: Yo your GTA lore sweater is fire btw

[1:23:20] g0styboy: you can make a contract for them
[1:23:21] JCerris: They'd probably get their friends to do it
[1:23:23] bt8tb: just make a contract for dealers
[1:23:23] sadboykami: ask for chip system
[1:23:25] hakobaba067: Maybe have them sign a contract?
[1:23:25] DeanIV: hopefully people dont act like shitheads and steal and ruin what you have going
[1:23:26] Rohan4uh: Have them empty their pockets and wallets while serving just like in City Hall @omie
[1:23:28] LasagnaBill: yes
[1:23:30] DeltaDesignss: idiot ?
[1:23:31] ohraidr: u could sue for so much operational costs
[1:23:32] SunGodIX: contracts 5Head
[1:23:32] kueil: yo or you could make a thing on the app were you imput the money they gave to the cashier and on the app it will subtract the amount they beted @omie
[1:23:32] JCerris: Yes
[1:23:36] Noxrif: yes
[1:23:40] ioan_james: Clueless
[1:23:50] marceloct157: Yeah, if your website keeps track of tables then stealers will probably be statistically losing more than average
[1:23:52] LasagnaBill: you can
[1:23:52] Leo7T_: Clueless
[1:23:52] brikbeans: "am i dumb, Surley!"
[1:23:59] W0rkhop: Clueless

[1:24:08] CopperKat: it would be nice of the devs implemented lock boxes for interiors
[1:24:10] oryeezy: shirley
[1:24:18] mortuusintus12: @kueil whats stopping the friends of the dealers to just occupy the whole table and rig the entire table
[1:24:20] luvvkoa: if people have keys cant they rob the whole house
[1:24:21] TheBlobfish69: TheBlobfish69 watched 7 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! Buggin
[1:24:21] MedicOW: new storage items will be discovered soon
[1:24:24] Just5abL: make a contract that if they steal , they have to pay 10x the amount..
[1:24:26] brikbeans: yoinkers
[1:24:29] litz420: u can enter barrels but not take anything
[1:24:30] Tistover: ya Û†ÄÄ
[1:24:31] g0styboy: you need to keep a tab of every bet in that case
[1:24:33] griiiiiiiiind: what happens when the actual city casino opens? aren‚Äôt you instantly out of business?
[1:24:34] lqxcow: only 4 barrels allowed in house
[1:24:35] SparkTone: cameras
[1:24:38] genuscorvid: couldn't customers just log their credit with a cashier?
[1:24:38] RapidIQ: this why u need security
[1:24:40] LasagnaBill: ask the devs for a couple safe locks
[1:24:40] Jackson0246: @just5abl dumb af
[1:24:40] alexdking03: Keep front door locked and when dealer leaves they check cash
[1:24:40] meego0o: it sounds realistic BibleThump
[1:24:40] brikbeans: @Just5abL +kidneys
[1:24:42] czx_void: @griiiiiiiiind nope
[1:24:45] fin6erban6u: Have your security search the dealers before and after they leave
[1:24:46] TheRealKeBom: can there not be some type of chips?
[1:24:48] marcoooprod: AlienWalk
[1:24:49] cobber___: lebronJAM
[1:24:52] rayhxxn: There's a dodo box thing at grime now
[1:24:53] shady_malik: the first dealer to fuck up going to need to have a really bad day
[1:24:54] myr333_: cameras + security
[1:24:54] Stepanov370: FirstTimeChadder
[1:24:57] kueil: mortuusintus12 they dont have physical money all is digital
[1:24:58] Ericktf_: yeah thats why u need to use chips
[1:25:05] beanzw: the goat and his son drake
[1:25:10] Just_Tom: has he hired any dealers yet chat?
[1:25:15] bandcourt: omieSussy
[1:25:18] MedicOW: @Just_Tom no
[1:25:19] griiiiiiiiind: @czx_void How does that work? People will just go to the casino for simplicity
[1:25:22] DarkKingLion: u neeed a bank acaunt for the buisness?
[1:25:22] onepan1: Giggle Giggle
[1:25:27] brikbeans: @Ericktf_ honor system surley should work fine :D
[1:25:31] oryeezy: lebronJAM
[1:25:34] nek2k: fake costumer tactic no?
[1:25:40] onepan1: lebronJAM
[1:25:41] Stepanov370: lebronJAM
[1:25:42] bandcourt: if they do it out it should be fine
[1:25:43] no_q0: lebronJAM
[1:25:47] mortuusintus12: @g0styboy ye and lets say a group of 5, including the dealer rig the entire game. they all bet red and dealer will put all bets on record as black and then declare number as red even if it lands black
[1:25:51] RedaB96: @omie like real casinos they need 1 manager to open barrel and give money
[1:25:51] LasagnaBill: he should turn this shit into a spa and confuse everyone
[1:25:52] JustTomMeh: a chips type system with one trusted employee that handles all the cash might be the best option.. turn in cash -> get something like mats as chips
[1:25:54] fartboxcustomer: meow
[1:25:54] kupseslonika: any pikols in town? pickle
[1:25:55] rheonyn: meow
[1:25:56] K47II: table collectors maybe? after every 10 min
[1:25:58] captenbibo: work with a membercard not with cash, every transaction is monitored
[1:25:59] aspr0_0: Just put cameras and security
[1:26:00] g0styboy: maybe make the dealers deposit the money when it reaches a threshold
[1:26:02] JexInTheBox: meow
[1:26:02] bigolkielbasa: pickle
[1:26:06] Just5abL: even they steal , it would be great, marty and vagos kidnap the thief on some vegas mafia shiit lysWaiting bouseCuh
[1:26:06] Noxrif: pickle
[1:26:08] iclii: wait u have more than 1 cat?
[1:26:09] youabsolutelegend: WatchingStream
[1:26:11] Vincheti: is there any way you can substitute something as your own casino chips? that world stop the worry of money being stolen? like maybe do materials and youd end up oppening a material stock company at the same time
[1:26:14] bree245: meow
[1:26:20] fin6erban6u: Have security, check your dealers upon entry and when they leave.
[1:26:23] MedicOW: Okay
[1:26:24] Stepanov370: mechanics?
[1:26:25] brikbeans: k <3
[1:26:26] Shadowdott: OK pickle
[1:26:26] JCerris: Yeah it's odd
[1:26:27] hbains13: mhm
[1:26:27] ItsDoozerrr: ok
[1:26:27] SadPeypey: mhm
[1:26:30] CopperKat: mhm
[1:26:32] bandcourt: right
[1:26:32] 50drax: AlienPls3
[1:26:33] bree245: mhm
[1:26:34] JCerris: mhm
[1:26:35] haha_been: yea
[1:26:35] Sh4llowGrave: mhm
[1:26:37] Ericktf_: dealers could overpay a winner without a way of knowing
[1:26:38] marceloct157: his website will keep track of tables, if a dealer loses more than average he gets fired
[1:26:40] RedaB96: yea
[1:26:41] mortuusintus12: its not meta cause marty already know it right..
[1:26:41] SadPeypey: 1 manager per tsunami
[1:26:42] bandcourt: yes
[1:26:47] Pasxaloschr: cameras bro its a casino
[1:26:49] JCerris: mhm (I have no clue what he's saying)
[1:26:54] g_a_z_7: Is it possible for people to by credit upfront then they bet with that and cash in winnings
[1:26:55] myr333_: mhm
[1:26:57] j07777770: why not make it so people only get paid out at the end of their play session?
[1:26:57] RapidIQ: y
[1:26:58] RapidIQ: yh
[1:26:59] busted912: Manager=Pit Boss
[1:27:04] bree245: @JCerris mhm (same)
[1:27:05] j07777770: that works
[1:27:09] xdj5x: Wouldn't losing one key cost you thousands
[1:27:12] Kozrick: mhm
[1:27:14] brikbeans: hellz yeh
[1:27:15] Stepanov370: @j07777770 less immersion
[1:27:18] bhad: staffing this sounds complicated lol
[1:27:19] haha_been: the dealers can be like random people u dont know too
[1:27:22] fin6erban6u: But if you make it a rule, no dealers have cash upon entry, they should leave with no cash.
[1:27:25] LasagnaBill: you need safe's with locks
[1:27:26] Shadowdott: Rust base air locks?
[1:27:28] skriddd75: how you'll know how much they took in 1 night ?
[1:27:33] myr333_: @xdj5x could just keep lock changes on standby, they're pretty cheap
[1:27:34] GBRnyc: yea the pit boss has keys and the dealer just ask for money
[1:27:39] DeanIV: distribute keys to managers when they arrive and collect them when they leave no?
[1:27:40] mortuusintus12: @marceloct157 this is good. like a 5k loss per day would be the threshold. so even if they steal, its not much and they would be afraid to be fired
[1:27:40] JCerris: @stepanov370 I think he has a point as long as there's a way to keep track of it
[1:27:42] JustTomMeh: I mean the most low effort option would be to give each dealer 10k, if they run out of money they have to go to the manager to get more from the "vault"
[1:27:48] DarkKingLion: someone can steal the key no?
[1:27:49] bree245: @fin6erban6u nah cause thats 5Head
[1:27:51] CopperKat: i hope the price of decoration doesn't push people to make their houses look like fuckin rust bases
[1:27:53] lust4cash: what if someone steals that key
[1:27:54] andras88ow: Getting so many people is gonna be hard
[1:27:55] bandcourt: would payslips work as chips..???
[1:28:02] xdj5x: @myr333_ make new keys are super expensive
[1:28:03] guava_guapo: does have the option to create shell companies?
[1:28:03] busted912: Get a couple people you can trust to be pit bosses, that can Oversee the betting and handling of cash
[1:28:04] Mrglaconnn: @fin6erban6u tips is a problem then
[1:28:08] JCerris: Maybe set up RP cams, would that let you see their streams? omE
[1:28:09] Jackson0246: this chat kinda braindead tbh
[1:28:10] Rhetorik: Could you have someone act as the chip giver? Someone signs in to gamble, deposits money, credits go on their web account, dealer can see, if they have enough to withrdaw when they leave they can?
[1:28:11] ibraas11: have a location outside for dropping off keys?
[1:28:17] bhad: getting dealers and managers to run it 24.7 and paying them more than g6 would be rough
[1:28:18] SadPeypey: mmm
[1:28:19] SunGodIX: hmm
[1:28:21] cateye77: xqcStare
[1:28:23] MedicOW: hmm
[1:28:23] JCerris: @jackson0246 thx, u too
[1:28:23] fin6erban6u: Tip yeah
[1:28:25] haha_been: thats pretty good
[1:28:27] ToastLab: @omie I can‚Äôt think of the name Marty without thinking of Banks. if someone at work is name is Marty, I assume their last name is Banks.
[1:28:27] j07777770: that would probably be best
[1:28:27] myr333_: @xdj5x not has bad as losing it all
[1:28:27] CopperKat: mhm
[1:28:28] SunGodIX: that make it so easy
[1:28:29] Rhetorik: just read my mind
[1:28:31] zemog_01: Yes
[1:28:33] haha_been: just more safety
[1:28:35] Shone52: mhm sounds better
[1:28:36] Jiveprism: I think that making the money safe is boring. More RP out of dealers stealing or a casino robbery
[1:28:38] SunGodIX: way more safe
[1:28:39] lo_r_ms: sounds good
[1:28:41] Vincheti: if you do materials as chips it would incentivise people to come and gamble because thyd want to gamble and buy materials
[1:28:41] CopperKat: digital chips is the easiest to track too
[1:28:43] kalven3141: yeah a lot better
[1:28:46] Jackson0246: @jcerris you are dumber than the rest of m lmao
[1:28:47] mortuusintus12: 5k loss per table cap for dealers then fired for 2 occurences. then dealers should have no money prior and after their shift
[1:28:48] RapidIQ: Im picking up wht ure putting down
[1:28:52] LasagnaBill: less convinient, more safe
[1:28:52] brikbeans: request paycheck
[1:28:55] lo_r_ms: no physical chips unfortunately nut maybe in the future
[1:28:57] DeanIV: gotta keep that domain private or your casino business is gonna crash every time X comes around LUL
[1:29:02] Jackelol555: have managers return their keys at end of shift in case they get robbed?
[1:29:10] longandjohn: how many floors ?
[1:29:11] Stepanov370: @omie cash to digital chips at the front
[1:29:12] ToastLab: wait, you made enough from gambling to buy a house?
[1:29:13] JCerris: @jackson0246 so kind
[1:29:15] CopperKat: lol materials as chips would be hilarious - people doing sanitation just to gamba
[1:29:17] kalven3141: it might make the experience worse tho, because they arent actually playing in game @omie
[1:29:26] JustTomMeh: how would that work tho with like roullete, if they win they don't get the money back instantly to rebet ? @omie
[1:29:28] RapidIQ: yhhh
[1:29:31] haha_been: mhm
[1:29:32] bhad: you should hit pragmatic up for a sponsor
[1:29:33] Vincheti: @CopperKat thats what im sayong @omie
[1:29:33] RedaB96: the new casino hesit
[1:29:35] CourierV221: vagos security having a shootout would be fire
[1:29:37] RedaB96: the 404 heist
[1:29:38] CourierV221: chaos
[1:29:38] zemog_01: Exactly
[1:29:38] Shadowdott: True
[1:29:41] ejayx333: W
[1:29:42] DavidCada: True
[1:29:45] viskib: OOOO
[1:29:48] ItsDoozerrr: mhm
[1:29:51] Vincheti: materials as chips!!! @omie
[1:29:51] Jackson0246: someone will prob do it tho lmao
[1:30:08] Just5abL: can‚Äôt you tell dez since he‚Äôs the head security to take the money to the bank at certain limit every time?
[1:30:12] g0styboy: yuno
[1:30:16] marceloct157: nah no material chips please, the virtual chips idea is better
[1:30:18] j07777770: that‚Äôs ideal
[1:30:18] Rhetorik: mhm
[1:30:20] JustTomMeh: ehh kinda iffy that means everyone would have to have the website up
[1:30:25] RedCantina: is this the company house??
[1:30:25] luvvkoa: how would players see their balance
[1:30:26] lo_r_ms: if its all cash then dealers can be checked when they arrive and when they leave too
[1:30:27] Dimitris_Hc: Maybe they deposit there balance to the bank and withdraw when they done
[1:30:34] Shadowdott: Whatever keeps the money safe
[1:30:36] zemog_01: Makes it easier for everyone
[1:30:38] JCerris: mhm
[1:30:39] cauxpa: @RedCantina lol
[1:30:40] 8uuo: giving money ingame is really good tho
[1:30:42] 8uuo: great rp
[1:30:43] Tistover: what if a dealer lies tho?
[1:30:43] myr333_: @JustTomMeh its pretty good if no one leaks
[1:30:44] onepan1: when u get your business license will u get the casino FCIC for the bankroll
[1:30:44] MedicOW: similar to how the ingame casino was
[1:30:44] UniiqueHD: What if someone steals someones "membership sim", can they use that persons balance?
[1:30:46] kalven3141: you need to keep track of what dealer updated their balance in case they steal
[1:30:51] dluo15: didnt u say u wouldnt do that though?
[1:30:52] ahjayz: who's gonna be designing the interior?
[1:30:53] Rhetorik: LUL
[1:30:58] bensiol: it‚Äôs faster too
[1:31:00] SpookyStarkk: So the in game casino is no more? I havent been watching im a lil out of the loop
[1:31:01] tt4alex: your gonna need security for the casino
[1:31:02] MedicOW: @ahjayz CydRose
[1:31:02] amicooble: just gotta be careful for when a lot of people want to withdraw a big sum at once
[1:31:05] DarkKingLion: then u are going to be like a second bank no
[1:31:08] Mrglaconnn: @UniiqueHD +1
[1:31:14] SunGodIX: OOOO
[1:31:16] bandcourt: did you get employees or a interior designer
[1:31:19] GBRnyc: I mean irl is useless to steal chips cus they are ‚Äútracked‚Äù so it makes sense in rp to prevent that from happening
[1:31:24] LasagnaBill: 404 investement and banking
[1:31:24] Kitsoooooooo: omieL
[1:31:25] SunGodIX: tax people on their money 5Head
[1:31:26] james3149: casino heist?
[1:31:26] Jiveprism: Would dealers be able to skim off the top and such or overpay friends. Good RP behind trying to find the dealer that's taking money. I think that virtual chips could take away a lot of RP options with the dealers
[1:31:29] james3149: BatChest
[1:31:30] 3dls: Marty loanshark monkaW
[1:31:30] g0styboy: and also get you kidnapped
[1:31:37] NEOS________: the casino heist will be you house now lmao
[1:31:41] Santyclaws_: couldnt a dealer just rig a game EZ
[1:31:48] Stepanov370: @SunGodIX 5% in % 5% out OMEGALUL
[1:31:49] Jackson0246: you gotta pay taxes to the city for this shit or nah?
[1:31:50] eleonorljung: what street is your house on?
[1:31:53] 8uuo: 100k 404 balance or u die
[1:31:56] SunGodIX: contract that says if you don't get your money out in 5 days you own that money ome5
[1:31:57] Shone52: you also have other ppl money while they got chips so they are bankroll
[1:31:58] JCerris: Kidnapping casino owner is new RP foh sure
[1:31:58] LasagnaBill: @NEOS________ the heist is a game of rock paper scissors with marty now
[1:31:59] xdj5x: Lown shark rp lets go
[1:32:00] brikbeans: A legendary achievement for 4.0 not only one of the first busines owners but the first CASINO. no Jinxing <3
[1:32:01] CopperKat: does the casino accept $ alternatives for chips?
[1:32:01] Stepanov370: @eleonorljung Grove something, 21

[1:32:25] james3149: PepeLa
[1:32:27] Shadowdott: PepeLa surely we wouldn't do that
[1:32:29] iclii: @omie whats your end goal? like after the casino peaks and is settled
[1:32:30] Just5abL: marty gotta have someone rob people who win a lot on some scam shiit like saying they cheating xqcOmega
[1:32:32] bhad: fivem oauth @omie
[1:32:33] JCerris: Hacking the site IRL omE
[1:32:34] justsamzz: PepeLa hackers
[1:32:43] bigolkielbasa: @omie You should do the login as the sim card number and a pin
[1:32:44] g0styboy: you can use crypto?
[1:32:47] j07777770: it‚Äôll be easy to make users have a login
[1:32:48] JustTomMeh: yeah I'm not a huge fan of the virtual chips, forces everyone to something outside of the game, and it makes it less fun with the money going back and forth from player to dealer
[1:32:49] mortuusintus12: so youre basically making an casino, for players to play on an online casino haha
[1:32:49] AmMello: @omie why not a magic link like the one I showed you?
[1:32:50] iiTzMatrixxx: whos house is that
[1:32:51] MedicOW: @Jiveprism if everything that comes in and out is tracked through the website he can find out if someone is doing shady stuff like this
[1:32:52] 8uuo: change password ever day
[1:32:56] Stepanov370: 2FA
[1:32:57] brikbeans: daily passwords.... or like ROOMCODES
[1:32:57] gobbenhb: You bought your own house+
[1:33:03] MedicOW: 2FA
[1:33:04] Sh4llowGrave: HACKERMANS bypassing firewalls
[1:33:06] Shone52: make sure so viewers cant make accounts too, make it so manager need to approve the account or something
[1:33:12] j07777770: make the site password a user login
[1:33:12] 2YIL: make it login with twitch or someshit
[1:33:14] YellowTang_: or connect to cfx
[1:33:14] explodingcamera: Maybe do twitch oauth so there's no possibility of leaking it on stream
[1:33:15] bree245: not redundant just safe
[1:33:15] iclii: or rather, what is Martys goal
[1:33:18] nxnja: you could take their picture for the member id
[1:33:22] Vincheti: in my opinion id you did materials as chip players would make more money since the price is changing and they cant comprehend that 50 materials isnt 50$ they wouldnt see it as losing money
[1:33:24] CopperKat: magic links would be easier
[1:33:25] iclii: end goal*
[1:33:29] tugsley_: that would get leaked SO EASILY
[1:33:33] kamwal: have people sign up
[1:33:34] Jiveprism: If you have user passwords then you can lock people out if they haven't renewed membership
[1:33:35] WeirdWrinkle: make sure they store the passwords properly, this is very important as some people use the same password in multiple places (which is bad)
[1:33:40] MedicOW: that isnt leakproof
[1:33:40] Just5abL: hold on , give every dealer a notebook to write every customer amount instead using ooc site or app
[1:33:44] brikbeans: @Vincheti chips would be worth 8 dollars a peice bruh
[1:33:51] FinnVsTheWorld: diff password for each person ez
[1:33:52] JCerris: An assistant could handle that

[3:00:51] DeJayDev: @Eight_D Traditional TOTP is only valid for 30 seconds, which isn't enough time.
[3:00:52] 5Jonny: nah my idea was stupid nvm i was saying using the sims to access the website since they're all gonna be in the DB already
[3:00:55] d4v1dplz: better use stateid
[3:00:57] 5Jonny: but then anyone could just use the sim number lol
[3:00:58] JCerris: @jar7 that's only profitable for Marty
[3:01:02] MozaicDev: can't this be done on google sheets, with permissions?
[3:01:04] icy_gamer_123: @rainycalculator he standing on it
[3:01:06] GudWulf: so the account/money would be linked to that sim?
[3:01:08] goodguy2434: would a spreadsheet work where only u/emplowee can edit it. that way they can see the bal. Idk im think simple i guess.
[3:01:10] Eight_D: @DeJayDev Was thinking of a session OTP not a TOTP.
[3:01:12] Santyclaws_: yeah literally just get dealers to create a one time code like in irl and send it to their in game sim with their stream closed when they create account
[3:01:14] 5Jonny: yeah its for login i was saying web access
[3:01:17] Sly_Psi: Are you going to treat it like A credit card and if someone gets stolen they can call and cancel it lmaoo
[3:01:17] 5Jonny: but my point was braindead
[3:01:19] 5Jonny: im cooked
[3:01:23] Tacker110: as long as you cant bets as a user it can be public
[3:01:31] Jar7: @JCerris you think they wont cook something up?
[3:01:31] goodguy2434: oh
[3:01:32] animated_rain: Have you asked devs for help? Maybe you can hire some locals
[3:01:35] haha_been: Ok
[3:01:49] Gaboneitor: why don't they all just pull up stake and play there
[3:01:54] rainycalculator: @icy_gamer_123 but has he bought it already?
[3:02:02] Liamm0999: what can they even do on the website
[3:02:08] BEAN_PoWer: the system is gonna need adjustment it will all be perfect after 1-2 days im sure
[3:02:14] Kitsoooooooo: mhm
[3:02:16] icy_gamer_123: @rainycalculator yes
[3:02:17] jojosplug: @animated_rain HELL NO
[3:02:19] JustTomMeh: is the balance bound to that sim card membership tho? So if they lose the sim card they lose their balance?
[3:02:28] notteblu3: FirstTimeChatter Dentge
[3:02:28] SopaEJH: @Liamm0999 I think they can just view their balance and such
[3:02:31] Tacker110: why do they need to sign up?
[3:02:35] 5Jonny: without flooding the site
[3:02:35] luvvkoa: @Gaboneitor GIGACHAD
[3:02:37] 5Jonny: with snipers
[3:02:41] thrilc: 2 step
[3:02:42] boejcs: Use discord bots to authenticate them
[3:02:46] rainycalculator: @icy_gamer_123 nice, hope you have a blessed day
[3:02:47] Santyclaws_: what about the one time code thing?
[3:02:48] 5Jonny: thats tough shit
[3:02:51] Vincheti: the day they register, their aprtment number that day could be apart of their username or password
[3:02:51] Liamm0999: @Liamm0999 right so why would it matter if that info is visible to everyone? if only the dealers have access to change the data
[3:02:53] dcgigs: don‚Äôt make them sign up
[3:02:53] 2ezz4m3: so lose sim = o7
[3:02:59] kimpo__: TOO much work for ppl they just wann gamba
[3:03:01] Greezky: qr codes and you just tell them not to show it?
[3:03:03] dcgigs: just make the whole list available for anyone to see
[3:03:07] Jiveprism: Do you think asking people to close there eyes, giving people a OTP and have the website force them to make a new password would be better than a discord server?
[3:03:12] Tacker110: just have log in for the dealers and everything else public
[3:03:15] kalemeadows: @Greezky Clueless
[3:03:20] TheGlobGoblin: FirstTimeChatter
[3:03:20] veqzei: what if a manager has to make the account and youd give the manager the password
[3:03:22] ChewyNightmares: Just have the first page say hide your screen
[3:03:25] blesupvp: This sounds difficult
[3:03:28] eleonorljung: you cooked with that one ngl
[3:03:30] meatcigar: so they need to link it to something they wouldn‚Äôt want to show on stream any way, like personal email or something
[3:03:32] animated_rain: I dont know
[3:03:32] Fossabot: omieEvil watch omie's newest video: https://youtu.be/S8rbYuNDXQI "Marty Banks | First Day of NoPixel 4.0"
[3:03:33] ohhotto: only the dealers really need the password right? the dealers input all player data
[3:03:33] james3149: what if someone leaks it?
[3:03:35] yunghoodhustler: per mail=?
[3:03:38] Bl8nkk: a discord is the best bet i would say
[3:03:38] boejcs: DISCORD BOTS
[3:03:39] fatguy27: why not state id number and just add them as a member once they pay
[3:03:39] DeathDoughnut: text
[3:03:41] romanspookie24: whitelist accounts?
[3:03:43] MyOwnPsyop: the crow riddles arc
[3:03:43] Wolfkall23: discord bot?
[3:03:43] luvvkoa: discord bots
[3:03:44] initialvlcty: @omie can you add a cuck chair in the casino, some dudes like seeing you fuck them of their money
[3:03:44] Rhetorik: Write it down in a closed room and have them close their eyes before they can enter it?
[3:03:44] dcgigs: just make the whole list public
[3:03:44] stratz______: Use fivem accounts or something?
[3:03:45] Stepanov370: leak is inevitable
[3:03:47] 5Jonny: discord is the easy answer but the most OOC
[3:03:49] ElFetouhy: In game you can share locally idk if it shows the document no ?
[3:03:49] Light1stNight: i really think you should just give thema preregistered  sim card and they just log in with you can send the password to the sim card and tell them its private
[3:03:49] kalemeadows: trusting a streamer to hide their screen Clueless
[3:03:50] dumbopoopyhead: maybe the website is read only with each player's profile, which has their current balance/amoutn wagered.
[3:03:51] bigbill2137: in a notebook in game
[3:03:51] TheDestinyWeShare: put the sim card in a snr buns box and have them open it with their eyes closed?
[3:03:52] jadeveon_: u gotta message them on discord there is no other way
[3:03:58] SopaEJH: @stratz______ ye but then how does he get them the discord lmao
[3:03:59] mo___6: ok
[3:04:03] Jiveprism: You just ask people to close their eyes and give them a OTP with forced password change
[3:04:04] SomeCubes: what if when the sign up an auto bot send them the password
[3:04:07] itskiiv: Like I said whitelist so people that got a code works only for them...
[3:04:07] Bruno530: what would the players even need to log in for?
[3:04:08] nextgenerationmatt: Is there any way to make a password variable?
[3:04:09] hellsh27: who's dungeon is this monkaS
[3:04:13] Dooki3: Notebook and get them to memorize it and return it  @omie
[3:04:13] meatcigar: yeah it‚Äôs gotta be ooc unfortunately
[3:04:17] ZP_Marshmallow: @omie make it a one time password type thing
[3:04:20] Tacker110: what can u do after login?
[3:04:23] xbrainwave: you send them a google doc with the password
[3:04:28] stratz______: @stratz______ 4Shrug
[3:04:29] J_Rizin: this is dope
[3:04:33] oofwentlive: password is unique to each user so you can know when it is shared with someone who isnt supposed to have it?
[3:04:33] Tacker110: if you cant to anything just let them log in with their id
[3:04:36] beanzw: @omie song request https://open.spotify.com/track/6j8gTlbhj9KJSeypNcNAS9?si=c5f1a58ec60c4394

[3:04:43] SadPeypey: mhm
[3:04:44] riotscream: omie is canadian?
[3:04:45] kimpo__: noone will trust this
[3:04:50] ElFetouhy: A password for the day shared locally by the phone ic
[3:04:52] Petrified_Pufferfish: annytfHmm tough one
[3:04:55] 5Jonny: omE
[3:04:55] Udeadman: Make it login with twitch account or something
[3:04:55] ZP_Marshmallow: one time password works great
[3:04:57] slbtierra26: @omie so if they lose it can they buy another sim that can be used to login into their own account
[3:04:57] FNTparadox: @riotscream lol sure
[3:04:57] Dimitris_Hc: Do a forum post that only white list people can see
[3:04:57] ohhotto: so everyone who gambles needs to access the site?
[3:04:58] Ugnaknak: Can you hook it up to a google Authenticator ?
[3:04:59] Maza_Manny: omE
[3:05:00] luvvkoa: omE

[3:05:03] Dragonogs: omE
[3:05:03] SopaEJH: maybe their state id initially and then they gotta make a new password after login?
[3:05:04] BEAN_PoWer: post them the pasword KEKW
[3:05:06] Insul_: "email" them ?
[3:05:07] james3149: omE
[3:05:07] tugsley_: email them their password
[3:05:08] flohwbye: using their fiveM account to login would work decently
[3:05:11] hellsh27: this guy LuL
[3:05:13] Santyclaws_: why do players even need secure accounts? dealers are the only ones writing data into the system right now
[3:05:17] Lasiqx: grab what HUHBibi
[3:05:17] JustTomMeh: are you trying to hide the general site password? Aka its the same for everyone?
[3:05:18] Jaeger2k: i mean 2 step auth aint a bad idea
[3:05:19] MyPC: You could have a message pre-texted to all the sims youre giving out with instructions and password
[3:05:20] 70ey: this house spot is so dope
[3:05:21] Shadowdott: @kimpo__ xqcCursed you know everything what are the winning power ball numbers
[3:05:23] netsuJS: @riotscream he is from chicago
[3:05:24] newnewnewnew5: the email could contain a discord invite link that has a pot that creates a new password every 24h? so even if 1 password leaks its only for 1 day
[3:05:25] eleonorljung: you've actually done so good martykle
[3:05:27] jadeveon_: @Santyclaws_ he wants to find a use for all his simcards
[3:05:27] RegretNoMore: HOLY SHIT IS THAT JACK?
[3:05:28] spacejambluray: is there a way to linkw ith the server whitelist

[3:05:30] newnewnewnew5: bot*
[3:05:30] nextgenerationmatt: Is there any way to make each user have theyre own unique password?
[3:05:31] JustTeeBee: lebronArrive

[3:05:34] polar_dev: chat u might just be dumb
[3:05:35] Ugnaknak: google auth that sucka
[3:05:36] Bruno530: Is the log in just to see their balance?
[3:05:37] SadPeypey: mhm Û†ÄÄ
[3:05:39] xvivio: what tech is it being made with?
[3:05:41] ShotofSalt: what if you write it on like the last page of notebook and tell them to close their eyes before they flip to it and then pass it back @omie
[3:05:42] Jiveprism: OTP with forced password change no? Just ask them to close their eyes when you give them the OTP
[3:05:43] boejcs: What if you/employees set up an account for them in a admin page?
[3:05:44] Light1stNight: duno i still think you just text the password to the sim card and they have to use it in their phone
[3:05:47] MDucks1: Polar make that?
[3:05:47] riotscream: cdn discord ap?
[3:05:56] ImJustUnfortunate: make initial login codes 1 use?
[3:06:03] mdrate: pre-authorize the sim id and get rid of the password username
[3:06:04] loadingl_: did u code this ?

[3:06:04] polar_dev: @xvivio NextJS, Golang, React
[3:06:04] jojosplug: @afastrunner that will last 5 mins
[3:06:06] Kitsoooooooo: discord is the easy way out

[3:07:00] YanoIsTaken: love u omie
[3:07:01] DeJayDev: @afastrunner The issue is the SIM isn't private information
[3:07:04] Wopie: leave a little note with instructions in a box or on a table or something for them to read so you dont have to say it to them at least

[3:07:15] murrohc: ome5 casino time
[3:07:17] DeJayDev: @dcgigs Gambling happens in real time, auth is important to real time platforms
[3:07:17] JCerris: Receptionist makes accounts, then users don't need a password and only see a summary and can't make changes?
[3:07:18] Kitsoooooooo: Listening
[3:07:18] DavidCada: SAJ
[3:07:19] coldestwinter123: is it possible to have a link that can redirect you, but before that redirect it gives u a token ?
[3:07:22] twiisteddmiindzz: you need to get the password out without viewers seeing it and with it being apart of the rp so a discord would be awkward to explain right? @omie
[3:07:26] SethaClaus: @Rhetorik I can give you the exact  floorplan from the gamefiles if you want
[3:07:29] KiraTypes: you hear the new 21 savage album? @omie
[3:07:31] scumitself: @omie can you make a document in city that updates whenever you change it?
[3:07:35] Jiveprism: Can you have them login with the no pixel forum creds? Like how you can login with Facebook? Or would you have to bother the nopixel team for that?
[3:07:38] dumbopoopyhead: @Ugnaknak can't you just make that public? since it is read only. would remove the account stuff. idk
[3:07:44] Rhetorik: just move around ill clip
