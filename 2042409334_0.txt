[0:18:56] Nomad_Ninja: never seen news travel faster than on a Navy ship gossips.... until yesterday lol
[0:18:58] Kinson1: @Whippy I know you started off with mechanic stuff, but times change, things change. It would be OK to change from Mechanic work to something else, but not continue to do mechanic work (but could still help and direct people to Popular for example).
[0:19:07] Xhrcis1552: BBC stands for something else... ayoo
[0:19:30] Theawesomeraccoon: NODDERS
[0:19:43] SnippetyHat: I AGREE COMPLETELY

[0:19:46] SlushieStar: Tbf dee is still a civ
[0:19:49] EvlCoyot: Agreed, more ppl should be that way
[0:19:50] fadebruhhh: It's hard
[0:19:51] DJWMG: I think it would be cool, if you were in an mc and mechanic, it also is pretty normal irl
[0:19:54] Bacon_Space: Do we still work with Vinny?
[0:19:55] christi_g: agreed
[0:19:57] 242_jay: depends on the context i think, but for the most part yeah

[0:19:58] mccaw98: Well, if you werent spending the whole day in the shed, and fixed cars instead you would probably have some money  LUL (this is a joke)
[0:20:07] Theawesomeraccoon: Yo Dawg Imma kill you, but lemme finish my shift first LUL

[0:21:04] Valroz: I mean making money while still building up will be important gruppe 6 just makes the build up faster but there is no rush
[0:21:05] Alidokta: i think it can work right? i mean if you think about it, most crims irl start off with a (min wage) job, and then branching out and exploring. Since the world kinda "reset" in 4.0, i can get it. But it makes sense to not bother with it as well :p
[0:21:12] Kinson1: Guber time then?

[0:21:44] EvlCoyot: Well it could be like you are working gruppe 6 to spy on banks to find their weaknesses so you can eventually rob em.
[0:21:48] Alidokta: yeah makes sense, G6 got buffed a lot haha
[0:21:56] twiceasnerdy: @Xhrcis1552 DICKS
