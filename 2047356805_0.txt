[1:39:51] theforsakentoji: get them glasses
[1:39:56] sky_raven19: its time to join the glasses gang owonerd
[1:40:02] LinksmutisLt: Tony don't lie you did not watch no movie with her
[1:40:03] B1G_B3ANS: Any noise complaints yet?
[1:40:06] Prebija: It's the Screen. Pc screen.
[1:40:08] notcehz: I didn’t know that
[1:40:11] DarthRadonis: yea older people usually get Lasik
[1:40:13] buzzerktv: i had lasik at age 18, and it lasted almsot 20 hrs of perfect 20/20
[1:40:15] thebrokenpxnda: that’s a thing??
[1:40:17] aestheticpeasant: DONT GET IT
[1:40:18] legendhasit24: it’s the rave activities
[1:40:18] vcentsk: elisVibe 🎶
[1:40:18] Haywiyre: yeah your eyes move too much before 25
[1:40:24] SpilledNuts: Yeah it's better if you're older
[1:40:24] ThatsDianaBanana: all lasik no matter the age will have to use reading glasses in the future :\ I learned in med school
[1:40:31] zombieaboveall: is lasik worth it in your opinion
[1:40:35] ReyJaggy: I got lasik in 2016 now im back on glasses
[1:40:36] 9nty: toonyIdle yoo
[1:40:40] bobbybedstains: i hear 50 50 stories if that works or not
[1:40:40] ATadBit: Yeah they told me 30 to be safe even
[1:40:41] uncool_alias: Oh thank god you said that i almost got it
[1:40:41] FlurryCraft: bro I would’ve told you not to get it regardless, it’s an easy thing to botch
[1:40:42] GoldenCookies: thats a bummer
[1:40:42] GlitchyByte: also lasik doesn't prevent further degradation. it just pushes off glasses for 10 years maybe
[1:40:48] radiusirl: hmmm thank god i havent looked into it. im 23 and was thinking about lasik
[1:40:53] rowdy_jl: yea usually you need a stable prescription for two years before lasik
[1:40:54] PITBUSTAR: get the prescription gunners
[1:40:54] Kahzel: adn even then i think the best time is still early 30s anyways because vision doesn't stall until a couple years after 25
[1:40:58] D3V1LCAZ: you'd look good with glasses ngl
[1:41:00] jayy__c: yea my dr told me to wait until im 30 because thats when my eyes are fully developed
[1:41:07] Tiilde: yeah.. the last couple of years my eyes got better.  so my old glasses are too strong :x
[1:41:08] EchoedWolf: if you have enough of the membrane or whatever its called you can get the surgery for lasik multiple times
[1:41:09] radiusirl: so wait two three more years then i should be good for good work lasik
[1:41:19] emlismeh: Lasik always reminds me of final destination
[1:41:20] thebrokenpxnda: I feel like they should tell you before going through all that trouble Hmmm
[1:41:28] TheChosenDumpling: I remember the glasses that made u look like Logic KEKW
[1:41:37] nalathegolden: my dr told me until you hold the same prescription for 1.5 years at least you shouldn’t get lasik because your eyes are still changing
[1:41:40] Snstir: im so mad due to my retina detaching I cant get contacts

I'm just wondering if there is anything you could PLEASE do about it on your end because whenever i watch VODS from other streamers reacting, i have no problems there.
