[0:11:06] threedogger: i end my days with you baby girl Kappa
[0:11:07] OneLastSpartan: PD drama like this hurts the crime drama. It is just these captains not understanding what no pixal is. They need to be removed.

[0:12:04] kointoss88: I think den would do great in shift 2
[0:12:04] kb420ps: The "Three Headed Monster" experiment is a failure.  The Mayor's office is gonna clean things up.
[0:12:11] jadedwrong: how will it end tho
[0:12:17] yabaijoe: gonna be a free weekend of crime for crims :')
[0:12:19] JimmyNewf: I was up until midnight watching the pd drama man lol
[0:12:25] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: I quit my pd job I’m chopping car now esfandWeird

[0:13:02] BDG_parth28: Denzel would make shift 1 great
[0:13:03] Leritt: @kointoss88 aint no way
[0:13:04] fram044: cornwood as sherif would be so good
[0:13:09] kierantodd08: What about the court case?
[0:13:11] OneLastSpartan: Cornwood is going to be fired.
[0:13:15] BDG_parth28: Big 15 months WW
[0:13:15] serioushustle: @jimmynewf what was the drama? I missed it last night
[0:13:16] RebornOffline: Beric prob undersheriff

[0:13:21] ramsin50: but you'll be shift 2 no?
[0:13:27] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: deansoHeart2 deansoHeart2 deansoHeart2 deansoHeart2 deansoHeart2
[0:13:29] Fossabot: If your enjoying the stream smash the DAMN follow button! I mean shit its just a click away... Might see your name on screen ;)
[0:13:42] JimmyNewf: @serioushustle go to you tube way to much to explain
[0:13:44] mathln: Pity shift 2 is so late in Europe
[0:13:48] Bestevenn_: Dean in shift 1, Den in shift 2
[0:13:55] jonski1220: would love aziz as under sherrif @Deansocool
[0:13:58] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: that’s desk stuff lead of a shift still on the streets W
[0:13:58] georgesaintlaurent: dean as captain would go crazy
[0:13:58] kointoss88: I predict they will repeat your situation. And then the captain will word their proposal to the mayor that no civilians will be able to run for sherif, and Noone with days will be able to apply
[0:14:04] JimmyNewf: @serioushustle the tldr is individuals in the pd are demorilized and a lot thinking about not waking up for it
[0:14:07] yabaijoe: i just think the pd need someone higher than captains, seems like too much work for one person at the moment.
[0:14:08] ramsin50: is shift 2 right after storm or later
[0:14:10] serioushustle: @jimmynewf will do
[0:14:16] N3mEe: where is the poll?

[0:14:32] hastymxb: is that london drip
[0:14:36] Pee_aRe: any early morning gifters
[0:14:37] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: Sgt position could lead a shift as well then above that Lt as well
[0:14:39] kointoss88: No
[0:14:40] Elochai: shift THISS
[0:14:45] OneLastSpartan: The PD just needs captians who understand what No pixel is, and can balance out content with RP.
[0:14:46] kb420ps: The only way that a new department would be a good thing is if the LSPD has no jurisdiction over them.
[0:14:48] kointoss88: Crane said they have no say
[0:14:48] Vikarious_X: Fingers crossed man
[0:14:53] mathln: 10pm CET shift 2

[0:17:41] HarryPatel: oop
[0:17:41] yvngneek: bruh what
[0:17:43] OneLastSpartan: it is not just Ruth it is all the captains.
[0:17:45] bdg_hyu: @BDG_parth28 deansoSadge

[0:18:05] captain_steve_420: Slacks and Turner have problems but Ruth is the cancer
[0:18:05] MuthaTuckaJones: I think a Cornwood bounty hunter arc would be really cool if he does get canned
[0:18:05] Pee_aRe: he def an OP
[0:18:06] yxng_paige: @OneLastSpartan nah turner is okay ruth and slacks are the problem tho
[0:18:11] Pee_aRe: Get him snipers

[0:18:53] kointoss88: Cornwood will get canned just like you
[0:18:54] alanm306: Poor aziz though 😂
[0:18:54] karaskyee: same and same
[0:18:58] yvngneek: @LoneSoldier021 fr
[0:19:04] kb420ps: @BobFromAccounts I understand that,  but I still feel that the best move for the LSPD's leadership is to completely "clean house" and get new leadership.
[0:19:06] KDRaid: im an idiot. whats an op?
[0:19:11] LoneSoldier021: Crime is ramping up, PD is burning from within, things are getting spicy
[0:19:13] xypher85: @kointoss88 not if turner is present
[0:19:19] P51F144: i hope you still role with that crew 1 day a wekk tho it was a awesome too see last night
[0:19:22] chmod_R_777: @SGOTIT Id say Ruth, DeRolo, Slacks
[0:19:23] captain_steve_420: Aziz being at 5 daps but not getting suspended is wild
[0:19:24] JustSomeAsianGuyWithADog: If 3 officers get fired due to 10 daps this early into the server launch, thats not a failure of officers its a failure of the system
[0:19:27] yabaijoe: i just feel like the server has progressed but the pd hasnt
[0:19:28] BobFromAccounts: Aziz is not stable LUL  That man is so close to lighting MRPD on fire
[0:19:30] karaskyee: just gotta get thru the trials and tribulations
[0:19:31] JimmyNewf: muy muy picante
[0:19:38] P51F144: something i thought i never see in a NP server TBh

[0:19:49] m4l1kkk: Lil Texas is happening. deansoRNG
[0:19:51] heat31: Gonna get a fine for not following DRIP act
[0:19:53] TheMah1337: i really hope cornwood getting suspended/ fired doesn’t disqualify him from running for sheriff
[0:20:04] Pee_aRe: Its just your COP rp Dean is better then most cuz you know what needs to be done and know how to have fun with it
[0:20:08] Lala61991: esfandL esfandL esfandL esfandL esfandL
[0:20:08] krunkel321: Dean we want to see you robbimg people like in 2
[0:20:08] georgesaintlaurent: so what are deans plans after moving in the new house?
[0:20:10] kointoss88: Here's how I see it going: max will step in today, the captains will doubledown on firing cornwood.
[0:20:12] captain_steve_420: @TheMah1337 thats the big question, isnt it
[0:20:13] helpfuladvisor: @heat31 He got PED he is excluded from that rule
[0:20:32] P51F144: i might add its one reason even with turbo i still sub nmpRich
[0:20:32] m4l1kkk: Even without a leadership position, better leadership will be better
[0:20:39] TheMah1337: cornwood was immediately made co-assistant manager for g6 after he was fired
[0:20:40] OneLastSpartan: @yxng_paige I have seen Turner once, So either he is constantly being over ruled or is part of the problem. I'll be real, I am just getting pissed that stuff I liked to watch is getting taken away by these people. Pure OOC. I can't even say the RP is terrible tbh.
[0:20:43] captain_steve_420: If Cornwood does get fired, I could see Max opening up BCSO as it's own department and making Cornwood sherrif anyway
[0:20:54] m4l1kkk: #JusticeForDenZel
[0:20:54] Landoram: I genuinely think LSPD gets rid of Cornwood...however, I don't think that ends the Sheriff dream
[0:21:05] Leritt: I dont think either you or Cornwood should get higher positions In PD not because you don't fit there but you will miss out on so many action
[0:21:05] KjetilHestvik: turner said at the meeting today hes looking to do more at the pd stuff now
[0:21:07] kointoss88: Chasing Ws is not good rp
[0:21:12] BobFromAccounts: -1 Driving
[0:21:15] BDG_parth28: #JusticeForDenZel
[0:21:18] danielb2705: You should get your revenge on Abdul today
[0:21:20] captain_steve_420: I would love if Cornwood didnt show up to his review and just said fuck lspd lol
[0:21:21] Scrubette: What happened with Cornwood?
[0:21:24] leodunes: Deanie weanie deansoHeart
[0:21:27] Bobi775: crims get punished so hard for losing unlike cops
[0:21:30] georgesaintlaurent: what if they make paleto like a different county with different captains in the future. that would be sick
[0:21:30] m4l1kkk: Dean's been taking losses for all of 3.0 tpo
[0:21:32] bdg_hyu: who flippin? chmbrs or xypher?
[0:21:34] LoneSoldier021: You don't have to catch crims immediately, that just opens the door for cool things like investigations down the line
[0:21:36] m4l1kkk: Too*
[0:21:36] krunkel321: We want 2.0 dean where he never cared about anything oxy day
[0:21:37] BDG_parth28: Once a great man said : chase interactions not Ws
[0:21:45] xypher85: @bdg_hyu you shall not know
[0:21:49] Landoram: @Bobi775 define "losing"
[0:21:52] yvngneek: !lurk

[0:23:17] koolcoach: The fact that CG has yet to be caught with the amount of crime they commit is mad crazy
[0:23:17] RevethyTV: He is
[0:23:17] RawerPower: but G6 is Civ life, not Crim
[0:23:21] captain_steve_420: I think Cornwood might quit

[0:23:28] xypher85: OMEGALUL
[0:23:29] Leritt: there is no fuckin way
[0:23:29] mizkifsrecedinghairline: Cornwood is 100% fired unless the leadership gets nuked beforehand.
[0:23:30] BDG_parth28: @chmbrs  FAXX no printer
[0:23:30] m4l1kkk: Yesterday's stream was top-tier
[0:23:31] catiseeus: People gonna FREAK if he does get fired

[0:23:34] GeeMcTee: i think he might get what you got
[0:23:34] OneLastSpartan: they are 100% going to fire him after the union stuff.

[0:23:38] georgesaintlaurent: CLASSIC LULW
[0:23:41] thebogeym4n: Oh he's 100% getting fired
[0:23:42] Nightwielder1: lol he slid down the side of the car like a cartoon
[0:23:42] krunkel321: Db was fun
[0:23:45] kointoss88: Cornwood won't quit, esfand is great at rp
[0:23:49] catiseeus: He said ruth was the problem he is SOOOO FIRED
[0:23:50] AFCBlade: I think cornwood gets fired
[0:23:53] RevethyTV: Nope straight up fired, the ones who review the daps are the ones that gave them. They are not gonna admit they are wrong
[0:23:56] S1Nfx: the streets going to be on fire if cornwood is fired
[0:23:56] FetchLong: Cornwood will not be allowed back in 100%
[0:23:56] saadmir0407: yes
[0:23:57] UncleJinx: 100% cause PD want Robo cops and not people with actual characters
[0:23:58] xoshanexo: I think he might get fired solely for the purpose of removing his Daps
[0:23:58] m4l1kkk: He has to get fired, it's only right. You set the example, he's next
[0:23:58] georgesaintlaurent: N OMEGALUL
[0:23:59] yabaijoe: hell week gonna come early
[0:24:00] georgesaintlaurent: NO SHOT
[0:24:01] UncleJinx: and thats fact
[0:24:01] manbrew: I would be surprised if cornwood isnt fired
[0:24:02] Leritt: Not gonna happen Esfand said if he gets fired from pd he stops playing NoPixel
[0:24:04] xypher85: Mornings with clayton>>
[0:24:04] chmbrs: that would be unreal KEKW
[0:24:05] Mardomus: cornwood def getting fired
[0:24:06] mizkifsrecedinghairline: I don't think Cornwood will be offered academy.
[0:24:08] GilbertGilberto: i doubt cornwood would go back to academy
[0:24:08] RevethyTV: No, cornwood wont do academy, he'll run the sheriffs office
[0:24:10] GeeMcTee: yeah, especially with the turmoil hes causing
[0:24:13] chmbrs: at this rate, aziz will be joining you guys too
[0:24:13] m4l1kkk: He has to be fired or they'll be called inconsistent for taking Den Zel out
[0:24:14] Pee_aRe: who? cockter
[0:24:14] Milo_lul: Remember its all Mr.K fault. If he didnt punch Johnson all of this wouldnt happen
[0:24:23] yxng_paige: cornwood is definitely getting fired but if maxs shit for the mayors office to oversee comes in first he'll fix it
[0:24:24] oldladygaming_: @Leritt clip?
[0:24:24] catiseeus: CORNWOOD FOR COMMISONER~!
[0:24:24] BobFromAccounts: Not to meta, but Cornwoods conversation with Slacks was insubordinate AF. Im surprised he didn't get dapped for that
[0:24:24] LoneSoldier021: They way Cornwood was speaking to Slacks, (straight facts, no fluff) was taken as disrespectful towards his leaders, idk if they will take him back
[0:24:27] georgesaintlaurent: Just open your new county in paleto with them and have 2 different counties
[0:24:28] kb420ps: I think Cornwood will be fired.  I don't see a reason to go to the academy honestly.  It would be the exact same thing all over again,  unless the Captains are removed.
[0:24:28] OneLastSpartan: What is going to happen is Cornwood is fired, then esfand goes OOC. 40% chance imo
[0:24:35] koolcoach: I’m imagining a “Police Academy 2” episode happening lol
[0:24:36] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: Cornwood and Denzel in the academy crazy
[0:24:36] Ebonhawke7: bones was making some good points last night
[0:24:41] Lala61991: max and Malton are trying to make him sheriff but also people were talking about citizens electing him sheriff
[0:24:43] xypher85: LMFAO
[0:24:52] xypher85: hell for slacks and ruth
[0:24:53] manbrew: cornwood not only got 10 daps but slacks thinks hes disrespectful
[0:24:55] Knallenstein: My guess is its slacks masterplan to fire you all so you can go and open that sheriff office... I said it first guys XD
[0:24:57] KizzyTwitchTv: PD needs restuctured simple as u got the wrong people in command and the rules are to extreme set on officers
[0:24:57] m4l1kkk: Cornwood and Den Zel with Barry in Academy is insane
[0:25:01] Lala61991: commissioner cornwood has a nice ring to it
[0:25:01] catiseeus: Commisoner Cornwood!!!!!!!!
[0:25:03] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: Max was def the perfect guy for Mayor for PD stuff
[0:25:04] The_Boz1: it was just crazy how many daps he got all at once for what he said. and yall aint allowed to charge stack.
[0:25:07] captain_steve_420: If Cornwood becomes comissioner, Ruth will quit 100%
[0:25:07] Pee_aRe: nah high command wont let that happen over having dap
[0:25:09] chmbrs: corn gets fired, mayor appoints him commissioner and now hes the captains boss KEK
[0:25:13] BobFromAccounts: I honestly feel like Cornwood hurt his chances of becoming Shierf
[0:25:20] xypher85: @chmbrs KEK
[0:25:21] koolcoach: Cornwood defending Criminals would also be hilarious
[0:25:22] GeeMcTee: would you be his deputy if he was sheriff and asked?
[0:25:23] Doqx42: I think Cornwood will be fired to setup the narrative for Sheriff as Max is outlining to have full control over Sheriff office while still leaving LSPD CoC in their hands
[0:25:23] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: @chmbrs ☠️
[0:25:26] georgesaintlaurent: a wise man by the name of X once said: “once the big one rolls, you know its over”
[0:25:29] RawerPower: Cornwood cant be comissioner cos legislation says LSPD submit the names
[0:25:30] kointoss88: Cornwpodbeleivs in slacks though. He won't be biased against him
[0:25:33] kbm_altaf: yo yo

[1:24:52] getanime: @danielb2705 wtf
[1:24:54] Superhank: demon mode den 666 online
[1:24:56] chmbrs: we know LMFAO
[1:24:58] Zunnun: They fired all the cops that rp and are on alot
[1:24:59] MysticCasey: The north will open regardless. Max is pushing for it especially with owning a house up there.
[1:25:00] fishmeatx: PD just need trustworthy and fun leadership
[1:25:07] Georgemcclure14: sorry guys I missed it, what’s happening with Denzel?
[1:25:23] Athbreith: tbh how pd is, feels almost intentional to make it nerfed this bad
[1:25:24] toddthestarfox: 369
[1:25:25] Zunnun: !dap
[1:25:25] Fossabot: Denzel Action Point Current Daps : 10
[1:25:26] getanime: so DenZel will not be an officer for 2 months???
[1:25:30] SoggyM0uth: @georgemcclure14 fired
[1:25:32] thomas123456789012345677: wht
[1:25:33] sirsalem13: I’m just waiting for the Mayor to come down on the PD, because it’s going to happen sooner rather than later.
[1:25:41] oSam9er: at this point Im rooting for the PD to fail hard
[1:25:43] thomas123456789012345677: why is the pd not strong enough
[1:25:43] Zunnun: Denzel will be a cadet
[1:25:48] MysticCasey: No lie that new PD legislation from the Mayor sound like a damn good plan.
[1:25:52] jy33130: LUL
[1:25:53] Jerti_: @doggensteinn did they say why?  we have yearly reviews, 1:1

[1:26:02] Athbreith: Man I wonder how Den is going to react to Cornwood being suspended
[1:26:11] sterred: @getanime at least, there is no set time on being a ppo
[1:26:12] Elmatron97: OOC i think PD just need to read the room sometimes
[1:26:17] k3ntrock: LUL LUL
[1:26:23] danielb2705: They will keep you Cadet and probation officer for the longest time
[1:26:32] sirsalem13: @mysticcasey it really does seem like steps in the right direction
[1:26:33] DanLGG: I’m pretty sure Ruth is the one that came up with you being fired until next academy so you could join shift 2 reset on daps and learn a little bit
[1:26:34] getanime: But how long will it take u from that to an officer @Deansocool
[1:26:39] Athbreith: That or have a huge PD meeting where everyone can air their grievances @Elmatron97
[1:26:41] doggensteinn: @jerti_ they tried to have a point system and everyone got pissed about it esfandLUL
[1:26:50] getanime: @sterred that's so shit
[1:26:54] kointoss88: I just think it's hilarious that the bonding boys tried recruiting cornwood not even 30 minutes into his suspension yesterday
[1:26:55] CAN2u: how mad would denzel be if he found out cornwood gets fired
[1:26:58] entvidya: den was requested on shift 3
[1:27:02] kointoss88: Bondi boys
[1:27:02] sterred: @MysticCasey I heard Turner discuss it this morning and they will definitly have a cheif of police soon WOOP WOOP about friggin time!
[1:27:06] MysticCasey: Shift 2 starting to go down hill. Archer straight up said she doesn't know if she want to be  cop anymore.
[1:27:16] Elmatron97: @Athbreith I think there more focused on RP then content, more content!
[1:27:21] OiAM_Paka: huh?

[1:29:40] Athbreith: @Deansocool Did you see last night Aziz was being ordered to go against SOP in a chase. It's wild he could get a DAP for disobeying orders or a DAP to go against SOPs
[1:29:41] OiAM_Paka: bro this new age Dean a fucking monsta lol

[2:34:35] fishmeatx: Den needs a goal
[2:34:40] jaydenL0303: chat who do you prefer denzel or dean
[2:34:41] Athasin: @Weedz420 Downside is RPing as a cop leads to him getting in trouble.

[2:34:50] Weedz420: yeah lol
[2:34:51] microwave54321: hiiiiiiiiiiiii

[2:35:05] Zstie: SHERIFF
[2:35:05] AndreSays: you seen the clip with turner, flop, and beric Dean?
[2:35:06] thricerice1: without a really good group Crim life is boring in 4.0
[2:35:08] ObnoxiousNinja7: Den has so many great RP opportunity and non stop content no matter the time.
[2:35:10] xRidd1er: is that an okc shirt?
[2:35:12] Athasin: @jaydenL0303 Started watching during Mandem days so Dean, but Denzel has grown on me.
[2:35:16] BigZHUNCHO17: We get dq for how long??
[2:35:19] fishmeatx: CLIPS?
[2:35:20] ezrandir: Did Den learn about Cornwood's situation yet?
[2:35:24] xRidd1er: oh dolphins
[2:35:36] slight621: @BigZHUNCHO17 Beginning of March
[2:35:38] joesfarm: if youre rehired, you start with no daps?
[2:35:38] Silvertap: Turner came back today
[2:35:43] psylongti: Just do shift 1 academy today, surely it will go well
[2:35:43] MysticCasey: Wonder if they'll do the fast track with you that Cornwood started with Slacks. Like Lenny did since he's a former officer.
[2:35:44] AndreSays: you are good you will get back in 10000% just wait it out and you will get some freedom back
[2:35:47] xblasphemye: @ezrandir good question
[2:35:49] xEvolutions: Corrupy Den Zel arc would be great
[2:35:56] thricerice1: turner is back so PD will a little better now more Ruth X slack running the show
[2:35:57] ObnoxiousNinja7: Yea, egg shells everywhere
[2:36:03] Riqui__: Is Donald Bush the 24th ever coming to LS? Kappa
[2:36:03] marsh_1911: any plans on going back on den beforre the academy?
[2:36:10] Fossabot: If your enjoying the stream smash the DAMN follow button! I mean shit its just a click away... Might see your name on screen ;)
[2:36:12] slight621: If they reverse your firing, make sure you come back with 0 ZERO 0 DAPs
[2:36:17] Weedz420: People gonna be afraid to say anything to Turner
[2:36:17] AndreSays: @thricerice1 do we know how 'back' he is? or still in a limited capacity
[2:36:21] chmbrs: *turner checks MDT* " YOU DID WHAT?!?!"
[2:36:23] uneik: OMEGALUL
[2:36:28] misteren3rgy: Yesirrr
[2:36:29] Riqui__: Oh baby
[2:36:29] AndreSays: @Weedz420 already been done
[2:36:38] hodgedogg: deansoDab deansoDab deansoDab
[2:36:41] psylongti: Odds Cornwood shoots him with his civ gun?
[2:36:44] red_eyed_jed1: @xblasphemye Den hasnt been on since he got fired, all that happened after his flight to vice city
[2:36:46] MysticCasey: I need to see if there's a clip of Turner finding out last night.
[2:36:52] zarinus225: this he is will get aziz fired
[2:36:54] massteroid: Does turner even know you got fired?
[2:36:56] slight621: @psylongti LMFAO
[2:36:56] chmbrs: we need manbats wife aka hood robins sister to come in the city
[2:37:04] AndreSays: bro you gonna get more people in trouble with your 1 lifer
[2:37:13] Athasin: @joesfarm Yeah but you start as a Cadet who has to have a Field Officers take you out and then you're a Probie who gets indefinitely suspended at 5 DAPs
[2:37:22] LamePuf: if you get Cornwood in trouble with another lifer will be so funny
[2:37:22] Techno_Plumber: Whats that thumping sound?
[2:37:23] uneik: wait if its donald bush the 21 then its his grandpa?
[2:37:29] ramsin50: do you know the exact date for the academy
[2:37:32] MysticCasey: How can you not know? Slacks put it on front with the "being the first officer to 10 daps" shit.
[2:37:41] AndreSays: @Athasin it sucks but at the same time he gets shit done so we will see what happens
[2:38:03] thricerice1: turner should be the chief of police to honest but he will not be fully around most of the time probably
[2:38:04] zarinus225: just don't do shift 1
[2:38:08] red_eyed_jed1: Clueless
[2:38:17] Velehoh: im glad turner is back PogU
[2:38:19] Silvertap: Like last time right?
[2:38:25] dfrostx7: You were doing well after 9 daps but got unlucky with the last one
[2:38:29] iREJ3CT: ya fuck shift 1
[2:38:32] ramsin50: you gonna be on dean shift 1?
[2:38:33] xRidd1er: u should just start ocean dumping all the people you accidently kill as a cop
[2:38:34] MysticCasey: Shift 3 got good people on it
[2:38:36] nickdrawsstuff: Tell Ruth she can shift...deez nuts
[2:38:39] chmbrs: you get on as shift 3 ends
[2:38:46] sekunden__: what are the times of the shifts?
[2:38:47] paigephillipsx: is he not a cop anymore? sorry just joined I know can get annoying answering all the time x
[2:38:48] Jay_B06: denzil getting back or a new character?
[2:38:48] thricerice1: chief three is probably the best shift currently
[2:38:58] AndreSays: why not do dean in shift 1 time and den during shift 2 until things clear up @Deansocool
[2:39:05] Weedz420: @paigephillipsx His cop got fired for some BS
[2:39:12] chmbrs: @AndreSays probably the plan
[2:39:13] nickdrawsstuff: shift 3 is best shift because Turner is/was the best captain
[2:39:17] Elmatron97: shift 3 the best, shift 2 the content and shift 1 is dead
[2:39:20] BouncingHippos: honestly feels like you would get another dap if you picked shift 3 :P
[2:39:23] paigephillipsx: @weedz420 ohhh that’s shit
[2:39:28] BigZHUNCHO17: Dean where did u get romero from Romello??
[2:39:32] zarinus225: PD will not have the same vide without cornwood
[2:39:38] ObnoxiousNinja7: Not sure who was having a conversation with Turner but exactly what they said. Once you get a single dap, you're under the microscope. Can't do any fun RP without a possibility of getting a dap.
[2:39:43] zarinus225: Vibe*
[2:39:45] st9736: turner not afraid to challenge ruth, slacks just does her bidding
[2:39:52] xRidd1er: sucks that you have to switch up your IRL schedule just cus you dont want to work shift 1
[2:39:57] slight621: @st9736 100%
[2:39:58] nickdrawsstuff: PD already done --- Max submitted his document to have direct authority over it
[2:40:02] chmod_R_777: he done
[2:40:03] bznova: no cop rp today
[2:40:11] Athasin: @chmbrs Yeah I don't think Cadets are allowed to work outside their shift so we should still see Dean a bit.
[2:40:13] nickdrawsstuff: PD dictatorship, Max will make Cornwood Sheriff
[2:40:14] justdjce: justdjce subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 8 month streak! 
[2:40:17] AndHaka54: well he kinda doubling down on his dap and ur firing so its not looking good
[2:40:18] AndreSays: if they fire cornwood I expect ooc shit to happen because everyone keeps saying that koil said this is 'content' server first. If they push away esfand is that not a bad thing?
[2:40:20] Silvertap: What i think funny is that was Slacks that fired u and suspended you and Cornwood, but everybody blame Ruth.
[2:40:22] Claxman2000: Ruth hates him, so she will probably vote to fire
[2:40:26] sKingNA: If they fire Corn hella ppl gunna get turned off from rp content
[2:40:26] ObnoxiousNinja7: Dude, if Cornwood gets fired, there are going to be riots lmao
[2:40:28] Weedz420: Weedz420 subscribed with Prime. 
[2:40:31] MysticCasey: @st9736 That Turner v Ruth arguement before Den hit 9 is legendary. Said she was acting like a child ICANT
[2:40:33] zarinus225: @xRidd1er thats like whole PD skipping shift 1
[2:40:40] undy97: surely on the review they will remove the last dap and then dap Brian knight for lies
[2:40:46] red_eyed_jed1: you guys all think turner is some jesus? he cares more about the uniform and haircut of the officer than anything else, nothing will change
[2:40:48] undy97: and also shooting instead of using taser
[2:40:59] sKingNA: @undy97 Sure
[2:41:04] j0k3rhub: @undy97 why
[2:41:05] chmbrs: what we need is corn, aziz and you as the 3 main in charge of LASO KEKW
[2:41:06] Weedz420: Cornwood indefinitely suspended may as well be fired
[2:41:09] AnusReaktorMan: Pd already done imo
[2:41:11] Jay_B06: no carnival anyone in chat?
[2:41:15] BoobieMiless: if they fired you they def gonna fire cornwood. if not its not consistent.
[2:41:15] Athasin: @nickdrawsstuff Thing is, isn't that how it is IRL. The police department answers to the Mayor just like the military answers to the Government.
[2:41:17] nickdrawsstuff: Turner is the only captain that seems to understand RP first, not just dap dap dap --- thats why people riding his D
[2:41:20] bowen764: I’m confused can someone explain to me? is it all RP BEEF within the PD or is there IRL issues?
[2:41:22] ObnoxiousNinja7: @red_eyed_jed1 Turner will take an L, Ruth won't.
[2:41:27] SardosSevenString: “Yo dog, we put a dap in your dap so you can dap while you dap!” -Xzibit-
[2:41:32] Athasin: @Athasin *President
[2:41:36] jas3370: Turner took sonya lying seriously while slacks wanted better pd image
[2:41:56] MysticCasey: @bowen764 PD command power trippin
[2:42:03] Erohw666: dont give these people no praise, you got fuckin done dirty dawg. >><
[2:42:04] GilbertGilberto: Sure
[2:42:07] azncheesy: cant be real humans if theres no real bias
[2:42:08] getanime: They should not have DAPPED u for that PIT mannn cus everyone get away with it
[2:42:10] notgoodtoast: that was like some esfand talk
[2:42:12] kikisocial: PD is doing HR RP right now LUL
[2:42:17] c0rrexx: to me its crazy how they want to enforce serious RP but are so inconsisteny - slacks watched clowns make ppl to jump off a bridge and nobody cared
[2:42:19] nickdrawsstuff: @bowen764 PD has a discipline system that makes it difficult to actually police, and punishes people who rp regularly --- the punishments last longer than any criminal punishment
[2:42:21] MysticCasey: Turner told Ruth DeRollo should've been demoted for how she spoke with Den and Aziz.
[2:42:29] RoloDage: you're taking it better than i would!
[2:42:30] Techno_Plumber: @bowen764 Just RP. IMO the server is trying to keep cops in line too hard
[2:42:34] ObnoxiousNinja7: People are RPing their character but they're not understanding that it's...RP and not real life.
[2:42:37] Riqui__: Just sucks that they choose to play as incompetent characters Keepo
[2:42:39] m4l1kkk: F off
[2:42:42] Weedz420: If you want to RP an asshole boss you need to do it like Kyle in a funny way not just actually be an asshole
[2:42:46] audy: PD in chanbles
[2:42:47] bowen764: ok thanks all for clearing it up I was very lost I did miss a few bits
[2:42:47] BDG_parth28: Derollo is ruth 2.0
[2:42:57] nickdrawsstuff: @Weedz420 so much this
[2:42:58] slight621: Turner is strict and rigid, but at least he will call out and investigate dirty cops, not just look the other way because it looks better to the public.
[2:43:07] AnusReaktorMan: Shift 1 🐍
[2:43:08] nickdrawsstuff: Toretti and Pred were great examples of stickler bosses
[2:43:10] MysticCasey: I've never seen two people get told to fuck off and still be professional as fuck. Hats off to you and Aziz
[2:43:10] MrPhoNoodle: any den zel after storm today?
[2:43:11] Velehoh: clip queue open?
[2:43:12] RowdyRival: can you explain how hard it is to get onto the server and join pd is right now? I think people dont understand.
[2:43:16] Athasin: Went from 0 to 100 and then lied to justify it. That was wild.
[2:43:17] chmbrs: queue is open
[2:43:21] Janman88: content and enterainment > everything else - fuck i aint around for some the SIMS life game real life shit
[2:43:23] Velehoh: https://clips.twitch.tv/BrightRenownedGarageBrainSlug-_Gzpm6cZpfdAYnQo
[2:43:24] zarinus225: @Weedz420 yup , unless they Redcon because he is good friends with Koil and also cornwood is important rp on the server.

[2:43:48] Erohw666: imagine firing all the cops that made PD fun to actually watch LUL
[2:43:52] AndHaka54: the problem is the captains want the pd focus more on the "RP" aspect then the "Content" aspect which counters alot of cops with daps
[2:43:52] Janman88: this whole: RL RP stuff which keeps getting pushed for no reason is meh
[2:43:55] BDG_parth28: @mutantzombie01  yurrr
[2:43:59] Denwopp: I wish every cop in the city would've banded together against the captains when cornwood got suspended.
[2:44:07] nickdrawsstuff: One of the judges wants Cornwood to become a Judge, which would be hilarious if he got fired from PD but then became a Judge and just made the laws

[7:29:13] Athasin: @DanLGG Yes and no. Initial shots yes, shooting in the direction of a civ not so much.
[7:30:21] DanLGG: yeah if she hit someone else that coulda been bad but she was justified for shooting Pnut

[7:33:36] Fossabot: If your enjoying the stream smash the DAMN follow button! I mean shit its just a click away... Might see your name on screen ;)
[7:33:41] Athasin: @DanLGG Yup, one DAP for not telling him to surrender before shooting, one DAP for shooting in the direction of civs, and another DAP for leaving the scene to pursue without checking if people were okay first.
