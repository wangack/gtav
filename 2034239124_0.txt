[4:18:13] legoliket: Might fix it idk LUL
[4:18:34] KeckyOK: the game I play, I have to clear the cache all the time cause it's always loading new assets and storing them on my HDD
[4:19:29] KeckyOK: at this point in 4.0 most groups have a base with a bench
[4:19:52] legoliket: Yeah but having the blueprints is the most important thing @keckyok
[4:19:58] KeckyOK: nod
[4:20:00] legoliket: Having a bench doesn't mean much
[4:20:10] KeckyOK: but they're ongoing collectibles
[4:21:00] KeckyOK: the economy is at an interesting point where it's competitive
[4:21:08] SirYogiWan: @KeckyOK you mean on fiveM, if so, how do you clear it?
[4:21:23] KeckyOK: @SirYogiWan nah, a different game.
[4:21:39] KeckyOK: but it has a similar thing where it keeps stuff in cache
[4:21:52] SirYogiWan: @KeckyOK ah ok
[4:21:54] KeckyOK: so when the game starts chugging it's like 'eh time to clear the cache'
[4:22:42] KeckyOK: in nopixel, there are a lot of customized assets that you load in and those get stored for later
[4:23:57] KeckyOK: oh damn, you're going for 2 months straight?
[4:24:05] MadChemistTHC: travpiES
