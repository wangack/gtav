[2:35:33] SirBabelt: So police officer can claim "smelling weed" on any suspicious activity scene to justify a full search since its not a "tangible" evidence?

[2:36:41] Snow_Bow14: They actually thought about it when implementing it. Otherwise it would indeed be lame.
[2:36:46] SirBabelt: Do you smell the weed only if they smoke it then? Its not like a person would smell cigarettes from your pocket either. You smell if you smoke
[2:37:09] SirBabelt: Or someone around you smokes I guess?
[2:37:36] esrou: Motor is going to be stacked with all the old motor leads
[2:38:08] starlight_above: tbh weed has a strong smell without smoking it @SirBabelt

[2:39:31] mystic_drewman: Sounds like a Capt position in a way
[2:40:12] SirRagnas: Yeah, any time I have ever gotten an ounce im perturbed at how strong the raw nugs can be smelled.
[2:41:32] recklessgallifreyan: Capt seems more jurisdiction lead. I'd say a cert lead would be an LT
[2:42:45] SirBabelt: So legislation already specifies it as a "burning weed" smell?
[2:43:07] SirRagnas: Leadership seems like the highest bar for any position such as captain. Not just specialization.  Lt would be leadership and specialization. Anything else above seems like who can do it best.
[2:43:14] SirBabelt: Actually, I need to go look how the Finnish law handles that, now I got interested LUL

[3:38:40] ayubfe: @Snow_Bow14 Thanks for the gift sub!
[3:38:41] Snow_Bow14: Love Raisins, cant eat them cause of Diabetes

[3:38:47] Snow_Bow14: @ayubfe yw :)
[3:38:49] pvo5770: yes.
[3:38:55] Corporeal_Phantom: ive heard good things about soaking them in rum
[3:38:58] rachelkachel: chocolate-covered raisins are good
[3:39:05] Imurdstny9: Raisins are good. Golden raisins are great
[3:39:19] MarchingBeast: @rachelkachel are you brazilian by chance?
[3:39:20] LoneWolfRacing77: i believe that you should only be able to valet where you sleep, possibly where you work
[3:39:29] rachelkachel: @MarchingBeast not even a little occamLUL
[3:39:32] Code_vx: Gladge i prefer grapes before they are bad
[3:39:38] LaraniS: they stick :(
[3:40:01] MarchingBeast: maybe jewish recipe? because it has to be either for me
[3:40:04] Snow_Bow14: Its sad that the sugar content is so high :(
[3:40:12] rachelkachel: my mom's cooking is mostly tex-mex or chinese
[3:40:14] pvo5770: actually, where do you buy them? i haven't seen in ages
[3:40:19] MarchingBeast: WOW
[3:40:25] MarchingBeast: that is like

[3:40:34] rachelkachel: she had a chinese roommate in college
[3:40:36] MarchingBeast: KEKW
[3:40:37] SpecialSyd: im a chocolate slut but also lactose Despairge
[3:41:02] SirRagnas: Sugar is fine as long as you have fiber to absorb it. Less of it will be converted to glucose.
[3:41:05] starlight_above: i feel that @SpecialSyd
[3:41:06] Snow_Bow14: So I love raisins, havent eaten them in years Sadge
[3:41:58] Snow_Bow14: Grapes themselves xD
[3:42:04] Snow_Bow14: they better for some reason
[3:42:06] Wool_story: Dried fruit is crazy high in sugar
[3:42:10] Wool_story: But..so delicious.. !
[3:42:14] MiniBerger_: I prefer craisins
[3:42:23] Wool_story: Dried mangos \o/
[3:42:29] BananaPuddingPop: I'm going to be the outlier.  I prefer a good prune.
[3:42:33] Snow_Bow14: Yeah any fruit with a good fiber count is doable luckily
[3:42:36] rachelkachel: craisins make a good addition to things, I don't like them on their own
[3:42:40] LaraniS: dried mango is like crack
[3:42:46] Wool_story: @LaraniS Yis!
[3:42:53] rachelkachel: dried kiwi nodd
[3:42:53] Snow_Bow14: @LaraniS sadly yes
[3:43:14] Snow_Bow14: Mango is my fav fruit, but cant have it a lot since low fiber high sugar counts
[3:43:24] Snow_Bow14: everything red or blue is good though
[3:43:30] Snow_Bow14: so I tent to eat Berries a lot
[3:43:52] SirBabelt: Another strike against the Valet mafia!
[3:43:53] rachelkachel: interesting. berries are delicious though
[3:44:12] theconvictedquokka: I had kangaroo last time I was in the states... how do u make kangaroo meat taste like fcken sugar
[3:44:26] LaraniS: @snow_bow14 are you T1 or T2, if I can ask?
[3:44:28] Snow_Bow14: @rachelkachel ofc ofc aint saying they arent, just miss my orange fruits that are so nice and sweet
[3:44:33] Snow_Bow14: @LaraniS T2
[3:44:41] Snow_Bow14: didnt take good care in my early 20's
[3:44:41] Wool_story: @theconvictedquokka Companies sneak sugar into basically everything, addictive
[3:44:48] Snow_Bow14: fucked my own body up sadge
[3:45:05] Snow_Bow14: @theconvictedquokka Welcome to Murica :P

[3:46:00] theconvictedquokka: What blew my mind is it needs to be farmed meat they won't sell hunted meat at grocere
[3:46:45] Snow_Bow14: There are some crazy laws in place regarding food
[3:46:46] LaraniS: @snow_bow14 occamHug
[3:47:30] SirRagnas: Valeting cars the way its done is immersion breaking. Would be cool if you could go to an NPC and ask for your car and there was a timer for your car to spawn or be brought to a parking space.
[3:47:32] Snow_Bow14: @LaraniS occamHug ty :) it installed a good health sense in me though. Sadly I only found out after the Neuropathy completely nuked my feet :(

[4:32:55] SirRagnas: Onx needs a surveying profession
[4:34:12] Snow_Bow14: Fucking tow ppl still nudging cars
[4:34:44] Snow_Bow14: Love it
[4:34:58] SirRagnas: Private property vs state
[4:35:19] Snow_Bow14: The fact that the big problem rn is towing is amazing

[4:36:08] starlight_above: damn it Jordan!
[4:36:45] SirRagnas: Funnily enough, I am a surveyor. I've been told by my boss to follow an easement because "there is a property owner with a shotgun"
[4:36:49] KrazyRangeK: occamSlam Jordan occamSlam
[4:36:51] recklessgallifreyan: Did you change channels?
[4:37:40] rachelkachel: @SirRagnas i didn't realize surveying was so exciting
[4:38:06] Nargil27: we checked with sean earlier though, and that is acceptable parking for them
[4:39:10] Snow_Bow14: If only we knew a supreme justice.....
[4:39:12] Empirics_: If only we knew a guy that could write legislation....
[4:39:17] d0ubleDang: Here's the problem last night. Katia decided to set a precedent that they couldn't park on that easement even though several weeks ago. Another judge said that it was okay for the vans to be parked there. The problem was that Pred was acting as prosecutor and didn't cite that judgment
[4:39:32] SirRagnas: It can be when property owners  do not like it that a water line easement is going through 8 peach trees that their great grandparents grew. I had to draw up an RFI for those construction plans.
[4:41:28] mrsbee90: FROGELURK
[4:41:30] wellingtonsmom: If the mayor says it's ok then why can't it be written into legislation?
[4:41:52] rachelkachel: @mrsbee90 occamHi
[4:42:15] Crosis86: @wellingtonsmom not how that works lol
[4:43:28] wellingtonsmom: @Crosis86 Then where does it get written down? The tow legislation already has exceptions I don't get why it can't have another one, but obviously I'm missing something.
[4:43:44] SirBabelt: So its a legal tow, and even if the permission was given but they could not show it, it would be "in good faith" so the fantastic "tow immunity" kicks in
[4:43:51] Snow_Bow14: The problem with that @wellingtonsmom is that they would need to have something showing they can park there, like a permit or something. Otherwise everyone will park there.
