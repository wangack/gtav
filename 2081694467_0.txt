[2:25:42] MangoSnow: I honestly hope that cornwood becoming sheriff ends up ebing the most epic thing ever and not just a simple election
[2:25:46] Scab_Eater_: moon2Y Max says he’s done after this term
[2:25:47] ChaoticSanity: against no one lol
[2:25:47] CowWizardMoneyGang: yea

[2:25:58] SumDee_LumDee: max has already said he’s not running for a second term, he also said Siobhan plans on running for mayor after him
[2:26:00] DarkJesta: But would Cornwood want to oppose Max?
[2:26:01] RevolxHD: @EsfandTV With NoPixel does Cornwood have to eat more food for his character size than others?
[2:26:02] Rivath: Pretty sure Siobon is running for next term
[2:26:03] Paranoid_Metroid: moon said doesnt want to RP that long

[2:26:25] WeiryGG: How does that make sense... Run for mayor and never be around?
[2:26:25] RexPappa: Could go the Moonmoon path, do a separate character for Mayor
[2:26:28] ColbaeTV: SEND IT OFF THE CLIF GETALIFE
[2:26:28] Kaiyo_exe: I feel like cornwood should over throw a government
[2:26:28] foryoucarter: does bike go away after storm is that why your scuffing it?

[2:26:35] irie_sen: moon campaigned pretty hard too, he was on for 16 hours a day during campaign week
[2:26:44] CowWizardMoneyGang: crim mayor
[2:26:45] Usahi_Light: Part of why Max got so many votes was because he's an establsihed character though
[2:26:45] petterseff: @DeeterDo mickey id say
[2:26:46] Toastbane: sheriff could easily take next 6 months of work
[2:26:47] Astral_Rage: The people would vote for mayor not the alt
