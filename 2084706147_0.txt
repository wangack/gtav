[2:25:51] FluffballRen: KEKW I slept walked so I did shit that made it seem like i was possessed in my sleep, tho the most common thing was punching and kicking
[2:26:12] eekahchu: As a kid I would have nightmares where I would scream and cry out until my mom came in to wake me up. I still distinctly remember my first nightmare. I was 4.
[2:26:24] NavigatedChaos: Same, in Louisana, I remember rats falling into the bathtub when I was a baby.
[2:27:05] MouzlyMakes: Wattafak

[2:27:31] Lucifer_Berge: The oldest dream i remember is a nightmare. My first three years of life i lived on a farm, was scared of cows yet always snuck out to watch the farmer put the cows out on the pasture to graze. Anyway, we move away from the farm and one night i have a nightmare, walking to the old mailbox at the farm to get the mail, only to get eaten by a titan sized cow. Very terrifying for a 4-6 year old.
[2:27:35] Beefabee: SlapaHomie
[2:27:45] REBREC86: my worst nightmare are abstract only form and textures and feeling scare grow up then i wake up

[2:28:34] atikiN_27: bad dreams can also mean good things btw :) they are just scary at the moment but the meaning might be something really cool, you just have to figure out what it is
[2:28:37] iCandyNicoP: I get sleep paralysis on occasion. Thats the worst than any nightmare!
[2:28:51] NavigatedChaos: I hate those seer dreams where you dream of things happening before it does.
[2:28:51] Philippopoulos: I sometimes have dreams that continue when I fall asleep again. For the entire night even if I wake up like 5+ times
[2:29:00] jennikoozi: last dream i remember was that I was falling out of the sky and had a broken leg and had to do obstacle courses while I was falling to survive KEKHands

[2:29:35] atcmurph: I dozed off during a stream and had a dream that the streamer was my roommate
[2:29:39] jessichuu: I used to dream of the world ending, deaths of people around me and random doom and gloom shit. I would wake up screaming in my husbands ear and can't move. My husband has ear plugs lol funny enough my mom has the same night terrors. Its interesting.
[2:29:41] KoalaKutieT: I have reoccurring tornado dreams even tho i’ve never seen one in my life
[2:30:01] Philippopoulos: Ask mouzly, my dreams are all over the place
[2:30:04] Lucifer_Berge: I am always amazed by the surroundings i dream up around me. Kinda love the ideas that your dreams are you traveling to different dimensions, experiencing yourself in that dimension. Love the ideas of myself as a spec ops guy.... or the more intimate ones. >->
[2:30:11] MouzlyMakes: Can confirm Phil is weird
[2:30:20] Mialythilal: it’s weird when you have a dream when you doze off while watching something and you hear it in your dream lol

[2:31:45] NavigatedChaos: You were hunted by Barny
[2:31:49] eekahchu: Sometimes I have waking nightmares when I'm really stressed out. When we first moved into our new house we had a small leak under our kitchen sink and I had a waking nightmare where our bedroom ceiling burst and just shittons of water started pouring in. I jumped up, still mostly asleep and seeing all this water, went and grabbed a flashlight and came back super freaked out to no water. My partner was very confused. lol
[2:32:05] nini_sketches: I also had my first pregnancy dream this year and i dreamt i had a little girl called Maggie. I cried when i woke up because i had bonded with this baby i had in my brain and i wanted my little girl back. @ziggy

[2:34:35] iCandyNicoP: I get sleep paralysis on occasion. ITS HORRIBLE Its the worst than any nightmare ever! I scream on the top of my lungs and try move but nothing happens!
[2:34:37] solid_swede: I have sleep apnea. The amount of times I've woke up gasping for air with black blotches in my vision as I've been so starved of oxygen is worrying.
[2:34:39] MouzlyMakes: Cya chaos
[2:34:44] moiidd: oo we talking about sleep paralysis? that shit's wack
[2:34:46] Ender_Panda: I learned that if I see spiders/spiderweb I force myself awake because it's gunna turn into a nightmare

[2:35:36] FlopsCannedChicken: ziggyjNotesassert dominance with pee
[2:35:41] lord_dragox412: @Philippopoulos Focus on the demon is the solution. Because you never see the demon, and trying to move your body to see it breaks the sleep paralisys LUL
[2:35:41] MouzlyMakes: Istg
