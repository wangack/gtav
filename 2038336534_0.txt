[5:38:07] NYYFTW24: ccv thats why he said
[5:38:11] Nulltiply: You worried about that constantly when you were grinding trash
[5:38:11] auto_wow: he's spoken about his main channel needing to stream certain timeslots or his average viewcount gets scuffed

[5:38:49] kablard: Asmongold has streamed on his alt for more than a year now, he just enjoys the fact that there are less people watching and he doesn't need to entertain anyone.
[5:38:50] drippyRoo: concurrent viewership @acie
[5:38:53] CRlCK: yeah it's hard not to blame yourself about that, especially because u don't know these people and they have different schedules some might be busy on other days so they can't watch ur stream the next day
[5:38:58] Ginoveli: making sure if your entertaining and proper viewage etc.
[5:39:10] Ginoveli: quota
