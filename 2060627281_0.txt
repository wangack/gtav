[2:00:08] kingdomFX: DIESOFCRINGE
[2:00:08] KiwiBladewing_: yeah
[2:00:08] m0stlywater: yup
[2:00:09] PhushyWillow: The T-Mobile Wifi commercial with Jason Momoa during the super bowl was pretty good.
[2:00:10] ondema: there's a demo for it it atm, you can check it out now if you want
[2:00:12] Dan_S__: is that a sequel
[2:00:13] augu85: from 1995 or so
[2:00:15] Cephyric: I can't wait for the Nomura twist on this 1
[2:00:15] dazzaisreal: oo rebirth HYPERYump
[2:00:18] Robba395: "Old Film" feeling called out here
[2:00:19] JohnJKnapp: this is a direct sequel
[2:00:21] benkidd: its a sequel to FF7 Remake
[2:00:23] KiwiBladewing_: i loved the old twister movie
[2:00:23] stianvn: FFVIII, and FFX-2 is what i played the most
[2:00:24] Cephyric: It is
[2:00:28] TeaJaySketch: Remakes technically a sequel
[2:00:29] madboyfreddy: its the next i think
[2:00:30] Kohtalon_: they split the original game into 3 parts, this is part 2
[2:00:30] pointless197: yay. remake everything. screw original ideas
[2:00:32] kingdomFX: @Dan_S__, Hollywood ran out of ideas again DIESOFCRINGE
[2:00:33] Cephyric: This is the 2nd of the 4 part remake of 7 they are doing
[2:00:33] ChemicalPpt: This second one is only up to as far as the first disc of the original
[2:00:36] ChemicalPpt: It's a remake
[2:00:39] Dan_S__: IM SO CONFUSED about ff7
[2:00:43] Galileothe1: need a whole as chart
[2:00:44] RGeneral24: FF7 original had 3 disks
[2:00:49] benkidd: I thought it was 3 parts
[2:00:51] RGeneral24: this is 2nd disc
[2:00:53] madboyfreddy: the first part covered about 6 hours of the og OMEGADANCEBUTFAST
[2:00:55] Cephyric: 3 parts yeah sorry
[2:00:56] Bowen22: @darthveigar wolfaL
[2:00:56] Brandonhipster: yeah this one looks a lot bigger then the last one
[2:00:58] shawnp800: yeah the naming they're using is super confusing
[2:01:04] augu85: 4? wtf
[2:01:04] thepinkpowerrager: i mean... tornado content is much better on youttube ngl
[2:01:14] sophsophsoph_: I remember having to change my discs quater way through then half way then again
[2:01:17] Skippysqueez: FFXII Afterbirth
[2:01:22] OvrGwn: but how long does it take to complete each disk?
[2:01:23] lon3ly_wo1f: but….remake and rebirth is supposed to be a sorta sequel to the original apparently
[2:01:23] Kohtalon_: there is meta reasons for the naming convention, but it's spoilers
[2:01:31] Qilllax: OMEGALUL
[2:01:32] augu85: hmjj
[2:01:44] pointless197: they do that with movies too. can't remember the order of the spiderman movies to save my life
[2:01:45] benkidd: its weirdly a remake but also sequel to the original, they are "remaking" the story
[2:01:47] Cephyric: So you have FF7 Remake whic his part 1, the 1 wuth Yuffie which was the Crisis Core story, then this is the direct sequel to Remake
[2:01:56] stiggywiggy30: @thantoscat @DarthVeigar wolfaHii
[2:02:02] ChemicalPpt: There's some epic synergy combo moves
[2:02:03] kingdomFX: SWOONER
[2:02:11] pre_order_subs: @Wolfabelle i have a friend that is a die hard fan for this game and all i been doing is calling this game Mid and calling it FF7 MidBirth LUL
[2:02:13] MobileArmor: Buff Tifa is better
[2:02:15] BorophylI: that's helpful man
[2:02:16] Dan_S__: ????
[2:02:25] Brandonhipster: The old twister movie was great
[2:02:26] dazzaisreal: a twister remake?
[2:02:30] ChemicalPpt: Cephyric that's still confusing OMEGADANCEBUTFAST too many words
[2:02:32] newbie358: @stiggywiggy30 wolfaHii
[2:02:33] justinfrstnbrg82: Lmao
[2:02:35] survivorb: i loved the old twister
[2:02:40] benkidd: Twister is a classic
[2:02:42] augu85: the old one was ok
[2:02:42] KiwiBladewing_: yeah
[2:02:42] patriddler: @Brandonhipster agreed

[2:02:46] wossi_01: This just looks like a mid sequel
[2:02:46] lon3ly_wo1f: yeaaa from what I seen, rebirth is gonna be top tier with ppl already claiming GOTY status hahaha
[2:02:47] JohnJKnapp: so the one character in this new Twisters is the kid of the old Twister movie character
[2:02:47] thepinkpowerrager: yes the flying balls YEP
[2:02:48] stop_thinking: for science
[2:02:49] Galileothe1: thts a classic

[2:02:51] PhushyWillow: yup
[2:02:52] augu85: but haven't seen it in ages
[2:02:53] dazzaisreal: looks shit
[2:02:55] ChemicalPpt: That film frightened the fuck out of me as a kid
[2:02:57] Cephyric: Without spoiling the end of Remake, there's a very specific reason they are naming the games this way. If you have played all the Kingdom Hearts games you can kinda guess what's happening becausae it's the same director, and Nomura is insane
[2:03:02] mangotang123: unnecessary remake ...

[3:36:35] b__ryi: Nova?
[3:36:36] BorophylI: does it have to be a detective, anybody could bring it to metzger
[3:36:37] pewthy: It's kinda Metzger or nobody

[3:38:06] greenmoose: honestly Riley might be a bad idea then but Candice doesn't know that LUL
[3:38:06] bloominghel: It is kind of Metzger or maybe Walker in my opinion
[3:38:13] duracel79: Skylar just got to LSSD building
[3:38:20] benb92: has candice messaged metzger or gone through Lula?
[3:38:23] Anonymous_Gay_Dinosaur: I was more thinking going to command to see who to go to
[3:38:29] greenmoose: Honestly Walker might not be a bad shout
[3:38:33] SasquatchInTheBush: Caruso is the only person in command who seems to be fully competent but he seems very far removed from the situation

[3:39:45] Haakky13: @Thorekh byee
[3:39:49] Kohtalon_: so Lula could work, she doesn't have to investigate it, just write it down
[3:39:54] m0stlywater: pred and riley might twist it too
[3:39:54] cheski2: Lula could give you advice on what to do
[3:40:04] JumpZeroOverdrive: submit a written statemen yourself maybe?
[3:40:07] wujci28072001: Riley is the only viable option LUL
[3:40:08] greenmoose: Give a written statement to a detective to pass on?

[3:41:46] wujci28072001: What also could happen is the investigation could reach a dead end and just peepoSit in the MDW ig
[3:41:47] unsolicitedsloth: Could do  written one to move it on, but still try to meet Metzker later I guess, not perfect though
[3:41:50] IceBadger: he needs to enter it to sync it up
