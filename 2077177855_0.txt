[3:24:07] onix146: 60 crates and separate them per area, one area per run
[3:24:10] ManakinEU: wouldnt you wann get less and then bring it back to your house and organise there ... then get more run it back to the house
[3:24:19] Nightbot: check out my merch at https://dotexe.com/collections/travpiper
[3:24:19] ManakinEU: so you can take a car full to paleto
[3:24:33] thajollypirate: 60 i think is a good number
[3:24:46] ManakinEU: yeah that sucks youd need your own place then i guess

[3:25:34] Gladie209: Someone should finally finish the house and make some rooms
[3:25:37] dunerjr: good day Trav n crew
[3:25:42] thebradshaw6: to organize things?
[3:25:46] Gladie209: But its expensive
[3:26:09] drugcoins: buying 1 or 2 of the cheapest cars and using them to organize and store could help
[3:26:43] ManakinEU: if you park a car in the woods that could work
[3:26:59] ManakinEU: but i guess you could get your shit taken easily no ?
[3:27:06] drugcoins: back when I used to play I had like 10 fagios in every parking lot in the city for storage lol
[3:27:06] wadebyjamesjuh: 600 for 4 bottles wtf
[3:28:10] drugcoins: think this is the most Ive seen anyone get per bottle
[3:28:18] ManakinEU: also no cops around LUL

[3:30:50] weird_squirrel_: is it bcz of formulae or rates increased?
[3:30:54] 1evilshark: maybe set goal 100k and buy a trailor up in these parts
[3:32:01] ManakinEU: is there even any houses left in sandy ?
[3:32:38] drugcoins: 1.2k drop right there
[3:33:47] Grachmann: I don't get it, how do you rob banks like this
[3:35:04] Suvaacc: @ManakinEU there are shit load of houses left cause very few people buy it alone
[3:35:40] ManakinEU: @Suvaacc i saw someone check for houses the other day and it was mostly just paleto and appartments in the city
[3:36:14] DezalbM: stacking really helped
[3:36:21] drugcoins: EZ min/maxxing

[3:39:05] Suvaacc: its state of the server atm, you could even see it from the shit you and 4head were doing, a lot of people just skip or are so afraid to get robbed than they dont stop
[3:39:23] Nightbot: check out my merch at https://dotexe.com/collections/travpiper
[3:39:51] ChoobiOne: running from RP is ban worthy
[3:39:53] Suvaacc: yeah, the grind mentality has taken over atm
[3:39:59] ManakinEU: the turbo robbing shit is more concerning imo that shits kinda scummy
[3:40:11] drugcoins: getting robbed seems to sting way more on 4.0 because of how hard it is to get money
[3:40:12] csplisskin: LMAO
[3:40:14] ky05uk3: for real
[3:40:17] DezalbM: lololol

[3:41:43] drugcoins: country riddim
[3:42:00] Suvaacc: i think new pd also amplifies the random robberies to being worse, cause they dont have detectives or anything atm. If pd is shit then powerful crims can just rule the streets more
[3:45:45] drugcoins: its so risky maybe you could get a discount Kappa
[3:46:30] sucio71989: DinoDance travpiWIGGLE DinoDance travpiWIGGLE
[3:46:34] Suvaacc: yeah i dont mean only detectives, even like very good street cops would hold it down more i think. But they have a lot of new people atm
[3:46:47] onix146: peepoComfy
[3:46:58] slorebear: if a cop like Brian got hooked on busting robbers they'd be shakin in their boots
[3:47:09] drugcoins: cops are down bad lately. I think yesterday only like 3 or 4 were on duty LUL
[3:47:31] Suvaacc: it is what it is, its just that one thing makes other even worse. It will get better with time
[3:48:35] ManakinEU: idk what the fuck they are doing with the PD
[3:48:59] slorebear: yep, better fire him quick
[3:49:26] ManakinEU: if they dont want a character like cornwood in the PD maybe they should just tell him idk LUL
[3:49:29] drugcoins: I think thats why a lot of 3.0 cops got their applications denied, new cops, new experiences but damn current PD is scuffed as hell
[3:50:29] ManakinEU: its a leadership problem i also dont know how you dont have CoP or any sargeants yet 3 months in
[3:50:42] Sikwit0: I feel that Saab is just set up to fail based on all the restrictions the PD have to make it a "content" server
[3:51:01] drugcoins: some of the gangs have more structure than the current PD KEKW
[3:51:17] ManakinEU: @Sikwit0 why is the PD so fucking strict then if its a content server ? all of it makes no sense to me
[3:51:58] ManakinEU: its like the cops are playing a different game than the rest of the city LUL
[3:52:45] ManakinEU: that is fucking true some of the RP last week was insane

[3:58:34] 1evilshark: he pays more on lockpics tho
[3:59:17] PantherVlll: unclear if 4head doesnt repair his car because of cost or because he would have to sit still for 5 minutes
[3:59:27] Suvaacc: and you cant use it in crime anyway, cause it gets taken away at some point. I think meta will be just to buy cheap ass cars and have maybe like 1 fast car per group.

[4:00:43] 1evilshark: but its money in hand
[4:00:45] slorebear: part of the reason 3.0 was full of super millionaires is because no punishments really hit wallets hard enough
[4:00:49] ManakinEU: i hope its not one of those thing that try doing once and then it never happens OMEGALUL
[4:00:51] ky05uk3: didn't there used to be a strikes til crushed thing for cars used in crime?
[4:00:51] slorebear: such as losing your 2 million dollar sup car
[4:01:04] slorebear: @ky05uk3 they got rid of the crushing to appease the complainer babies
[4:01:06] Suvaacc: @slorebear if it gets marked for 3 violent felonies, it gets auctioned away i think and original owner cant buy it

[4:06:06] slorebear: i wonder if they'd make a financial crime out of a civ selling a car to a crim then
[4:06:39] slorebear: you could just get a network of civs to sell to eachother and muddy the water then finally get a crim their car back

[4:12:52] AidenNortha: Yeah its so annoying, i get 1 an evening at most
[4:13:11] coolwhipfire: how does 4head gets it all the time?
[4:13:30] onix146: 1 or 2 depends on how many people are sign in
[4:13:44] MarKingYo: he got AC prio
[4:13:54] DirtyGravRips: looks like the chop guy blessed him finally with AC jobs
[4:14:17] Suvaacc: 4head was too dumb to make money so they coded in the +luck modifier for AC jobs

[4:15:20] coolwhipfire: @slorebear cause he shit at roof running LUL
[4:15:25] Suvaacc: if you dont get roofs at all then chop is worth, cause you are pretty much guaranteed 2 jobs a night and thats same as 1 roof
[4:15:30] PantherVlll: chop parts weigh less now so you can run it down in the sewers with only 2 people
[4:15:34] 1evilshark: its constant 2 jobs a night, around 20 parts
[4:15:41] 1evilshark: but its split with 2 ppl
[4:15:42] allyliciousx: @slorebear travpiL
[4:15:50] allyliciousx: @ky05uk3 travpiHappy toadphHypers
[4:15:53] AidenNortha: I think it's depending on if you wanna grind the parts for mats or not
[4:16:05] AidenNortha: I have never had a cop respond to my roof calls
[4:16:13] AidenNortha: It's a shame
[4:16:34] ky05uk3: running over Kiki
[4:16:35] 1evilshark: i have a feeling he might have a blueprint drop from chopped cars, but he doesn't wanna do it

[4:17:44] slorebear: not-snow doesnt even run scenes yet
[4:17:53] slorebear: hes actually playing the rookie role really well
[4:18:07] Suvaacc: yeah there are couple of old very good cops, but if they dont have good backup for comms then they are playing like 1 hand tied to their back
[4:18:44] AidenNortha: I believe he is
[4:19:15] DezalbM: ye they call him mcnutty cuz of his driving style is wicked
[4:19:27] MadChemistTHC: Bones and McNaulty both are cracked drivers
[4:19:42] AidenNortha: Bones if he doens't crash into a pole PEPW
[4:20:03] Suvaacc: its just the situation, most of crims are like old vets and most of pd is new people. Be it purely gta mechanics or np cop sop-s. It will take like 6months minimum i think when crims need to start putting in more effort to escape
[4:20:45] onix146: NODDERS

[4:27:18] onix146: not really you can have a 200 runner, just takes lots of time
