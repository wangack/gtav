What I'm talking about is farmers building processing plants themselves and then forming collectives and going direct to consumers or wholesalers. You're talking about something else entirely. Homesteading is people raising and processing their own meat for home use.

[4:22:52] Moby1kanobee: @PIayinItSafe thats more of a short term scmam for money even he said so, the real businesses will start when the govt gets in place and you can apply for a license etc
[4:22:53] TeaNMuffins: I've eyeballed a business ALL of my RP career and only ever seen it used once in my 2000 hours on FiveM, and would love to pursue it on NP...

[4:54:54] coinve: the same way luci is a head on the sani
[4:54:55] TastyKudzu: Honestly Dougie not being a union leader is good. Eventually the union will fall under suspicion by PD for something and Dougie being just a lowly member will work to his advantage.
[4:54:56] Fugeki: it’s a lot for sure peer pressure whether it’s direct or not is hard to say no to for sure
[4:54:58] Hogie48: Heads make decisions not the day to day

[4:55:42] qvbxx: do the bags degrade?
[4:55:46] Fugeki: basically the union heads are the dons clean persona not much can be ask other than that
[4:55:48] nsk_envy: Kiwo plays Dougie too? Wtf! Kappa
[4:56:08] FaithfulBullet: In Dougie's mind, Lang and Harry should be on the same page, so when he got pulled in two different directions by his "bosses", he didn't really know what to do.
[4:56:09] iamwillbur: chats weird today ngl
[4:56:11] Bill_Collector: The union is gonna become some people's sole focus, it's that big
