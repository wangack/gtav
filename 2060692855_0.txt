[0:36:30] Athasin: Stockpiling? Gun trafficking?
[0:36:32] mutantzombie01: possession of class one
[0:36:32] bdg_hyu: isnt he suspected of stockpiling weapons?
[0:36:37] FunChatt: He bought guns
[0:36:53] Athasin: Stockpiling definitely
[0:36:57] MexiBrent: have you caught him selling the guns?
[0:37:00] xvohrtex: he isnt selling he is buying no?
[0:37:01] bdg_hyu: isnt stockpiling a charge?
[0:37:06] jetbawls: zero evidence gyatt dam
[0:37:07] char69: Just stockpiling, no? Unless you have evidence he has sold some
[0:37:15] quaylewastaken: It is
[0:37:17] Athasin: Criminal possession of class 1 @Deansocool
[0:37:41] MexiBrent: it is but i think you would have to add it after you raid some one and find the guns
[0:37:42] chmbrs: 40K ?!?!?! KEKW
[0:38:08] mutantzombie01: @Deansocool why you have so many reports open
[0:38:13] Mark14____: what a tune
[0:38:15] RonJon: morning
[0:38:23] MenacingCapybara: whatup whatup
[0:38:28] Athasin: @chmbrs Imagine all 6 were PD guns
[0:38:49] Athasin: @Athasin $640K fine
[0:38:52] Athasin: Life over
[0:38:58] jetbawls: time to make a character called Al Snitch and say every single person has rockets in their home
[0:38:59] BigglesVII: Would the charge stack if there are more than 6 weapons found?
[0:39:09] RonJon: yes
[0:39:15] monkeyastronaut25: wait they caught Jp?
[0:39:19] BigglesVII: Brutal lol
[0:39:23] toddthestarfox: I thought it was speculated he could have 60
[0:39:27] alanm306: Tyrone owned aziz in court yesterday 😂😂
[0:39:57] Athasin: @BigglesVII Yeah because the charge is "firearm" not firearms so it would be multiple counts of criminal possession of a PD firearm
[0:39:59] talgach: yooooo
[0:40:01] BigglesVII: 50k and the guns only cost 750 each, could have a crazy amount
[0:40:08] talgach: wsg dean and chat deanTwerk
[0:40:23] julieannxox: wsg tal Yoo
[0:40:26] talgach: mmmmmmmmm stoopid
[0:40:35] talgach: @julieannxox Wulieann yoo
[0:40:49] Emeralblade: What concrete evidence does anyone have on any of this? Or we just going on the word of a "known liar (in pd eyes) that he said he had guns?
[0:41:22] Athasin: @Emeralblade HE ADVERTISED IT!!
[0:41:35] Aoniar: to court house cause sounds like you went to court
[0:42:06] Blkjckss: deansoGVO deansoGVO deansoGVO
[0:42:14] RonJon: what song is this
[0:42:19] Emeralblade: Yeah, but I can say anything that doesn't mean he has stuff. He could and should assume to be lying to get a rise out of the pd.
[0:42:26] GreatDane_92: so we still don't know for sure if gregory stockpiling?
[0:42:30] iiamgigachad: he will stash them away before any cop go near his appartment

[0:43:52] LustyHeart: Deez nuts :)
[0:44:04] TheFiku: nice hairstyle W
[0:44:13] Athasin: @Emeralblade Means motive and opportunity. Means - he had his license for 24 hours, motive - he threatened 2 cops, 24 hours
[0:44:22] LustyHeart: So was there an update to that case? I cant read the RED Words on the report
[0:44:23] TheBroStud: I dont think it is good for Den Zel :D First he runs him over with a car and then he raids his house, Johnson is gonna hunt Den Zels ass down for sure :D
[0:44:34] pawneefour: Has cornwood slept? I'm concerned for his health
[0:44:39] BigglesVII: @Emeralblade Imagine the carnage of 50+ pd guns getting loose on the streets lol
[0:44:54] Athasin: @Emeralblade Then you add in that fact that he advertised his services and talked to a lawyer without privilege about it
[0:44:57] NemoBlu: @TheBroStud when did they raid johnson?
[0:45:03] TheBroStud: @pawneefour He has been live for 21h
[0:45:22] TheBroStud: @NemoBlu They are about too, read the warrent on the screen
[0:45:25] LustyHeart: Chat what does the red colored text say on the report?
[0:45:27] TheFiku: better not get fired today dean ElNoSabe
[0:45:32] TheMagnificentBastard: Dean check the discord General channel when you have a chance
[0:45:36] Athasin: @Emeralblade All together they have enough
[0:45:43] Emeralblade: :shrug: he never said anything about violence in his words. :shrug:
[0:45:44] MexiBrent: @LustyHeart its a template, means to put in the info
[0:45:45] Nadeflow: that statements me when i need 100 more words in a essay deansoP
[0:45:59] LustyHeart: @MexiBrent Thank you :D
[0:46:06] riiftzzz: he doesnt know ElNoSabe
[0:46:14] Emeralblade: And what captain gets accessory because they didn't take his license away then?
[0:46:30] jetbawls: any sane person wouldnt approve based on heresay but its nopixel so who cares
[0:46:37] Dream_Canceled: ^
[0:46:41] TheFiku: @Nadeflow KEK  thank god we have AI now
[0:46:51] danielb2705: You need to add the threats he gave to you and Suarez
[0:46:57] lazydog905: did Johnson for sure buy weapons or is this all speculation?
[0:46:57] Athasin: I 100% think Slacks should get 3 DAPs for not taking away his license in time
[0:47:22] 1angry_scottish: How come that he had it for 24 hrs after he got fired and no one's getting a dap for that
[0:47:42] 1angry_scottish: @athasin yeah I was just thinking that
[0:47:45] Dream_Canceled: Heresay rarely leads to a court approval on a warrant. Special exceptions are for things such as terroristic threats
[0:47:48] SamuraiMotion: SamuraiMotion converted from a Prime sub to a Tier 1 sub! 
[0:47:53] Bruggie: @1angry_scottish Who gonna Dap Slacks :V
[0:48:01] tonychuleta: perfect song for the raid
[0:48:08] Nadeflow: @TheFiku Grammarly n chat gpt stocks to the moon TooSmart
[0:48:09] talgach: WWW fresh prime
[0:48:10] danielb2705: Add about the threats
[0:48:11] 1angry_scottish: @bruggie yeah why not
[0:48:26] Athasin: Considering Crane is the one asking the cops to make the warrant chat... Johnson is toast
[0:48:48] BigglesVII: It will help his lawsuit against the pd if the same officer that got him run over did the warrant lol
[0:48:52] jetbawls: ah yes osama bin crane on the case
[0:48:56] Nadeflow: saddam huCrane Prayge
[0:48:59] sharrkuu: imagine Johnson ends up in cg
[0:49:00] EndoraDC: woo still pd. i missed a little so im catching up from the weekend
[0:49:05] birdking416: goddamn saleem
[0:49:10] aniquilattion: @bigglesvii and if they find nothing too
[0:49:15] quaylewastaken: Your the on writing a warrant  based on hear say
[0:49:17] Skenoj: i am here to see the ads, RUN THEM ADS
[0:49:25] Dream_Canceled: @aniquilattion Exactly.
[0:49:37] 1angry_scottish: That definitely feels that was a mistake made by slacks
[0:49:38] BigglesVII: @aniquilattion Yeah, should be a good storyline
[0:49:40] TheFiku: @TheFiku bro that pfp tho HUH
[0:49:51] Bruggie: @Skenoj Adblock lil bro
[0:49:55] aniquilattion: so you can write a warrant based on hearsay?
[0:49:59] Fossabot: If your enjoying the stream smash the DAMN follow button! I mean shit its just a click away... Might see your name on screen ;)
[0:50:05] Athasin: @quaylewastaken Unfortunately he was ordered to by Ruth.
[0:50:05] MexiBrent: Dens just doing what he is told, Captain still neds to approve before it goes to a judge so itll be on them
[0:50:17] Dr_Epica: show it to ruth first just to be sure LuL
[0:50:24] TheFiku: mhm
[0:50:25] Nadeflow: @TheFiku deansoGlizzy
[0:50:30] Dream_Canceled: @aniquilattion a warrant would not get approved in a court of law based on heresay. There are special exceptions, but this is not one of those exeptions.
[0:50:38] captain_steve_420: Not your fault Johnson's a fuckup
[0:50:49] Emeralblade: You can still bring up concerns. If you don't, you are omitting almost as bad as Johnson did.
[0:50:52] LustyHeart: @Deansocool isnt this all circumstantial evidence? There isnt even any real evidence he has more guns..
[0:50:52] jetbawls: ruth raided someone based on the person telling em they had grenades in their house, anythings possible
[0:50:53] lazydog905: @mexibrent sweet.  this covers his dap ass
[0:51:02] Emeralblade: And I don't think D is like that
[0:51:04] Nadeflow: Johnson was a g respect my man
[0:51:07] NemoBlu: got to go grab my meds, hope i dont miss the raid
[0:51:07] Dream_Canceled: @aniquilattion with that being said, this is RP and not real life LOL
[0:51:10] TheFiku: corndog 20h shift LULW
[0:51:13] aniquilattion: getting on ruths good side LUL
[0:51:13] TCxSlasher: was Johnson arrested?
[0:51:14] Athasin: To be fair you should be asking Ruth for "clarification texts" so you have written proof of the things she ask you to do
[0:51:31] Dream_Canceled: Are any of the lawyers in RP actual lawyers?
[0:51:32] steve_more: Johnson gonna get paid hella bank, when they find nothing in the RAID, plus the pit issue, plus the firing, he's gonna claim massive discrimination etc, he gonna get 200k+ lol
[0:51:36] quaylewastaken: I can't wait till he hears about azies
[0:51:40] MexiBrent: also you can get a warrant off heresay as long as the heresay covers the probable cause
[0:51:49] momzzyy: this man cornwood does not sleep LUL
[0:51:55] captain_steve_420: @steve_more Cope
[0:52:12] Athasin: @TCxSlasher No, but they're trying to get a warrant to search his place at the advisement of Crane
[0:52:19] theweezzz: why would they make the guy who sent Johnson to the hospital write a search warrant for the same guy lol
[0:52:23] TheFiku: ruth modCheck
[0:52:25] steve_more: OK? I'm a denz fan 420, it's not cope, it's facts from all the RP
[0:52:25] Dream_Canceled: I eat corn the long way just to feel something
[0:52:27] misteren3rgy: bros 21 hours in wild
[0:52:44] EndoraDC: if he's named in a lawsuit wouldnt it be conflict for h im to write a warrant
[0:52:48] MenacingCapybara: SayWhatNow
[0:52:50] Enoobrac: man is off the addy doing 21 hours GTA RP
[0:52:52] Athasin: @theweezzz Because he put up the bolo
[0:52:54] EndoraDC: its a ruth set up

[0:53:15] mattz112: na im kiddint
[0:53:16] zelanests: hey dean
[0:53:17] BigglesVII: Need to remember this is no pixel and not RL. There is hardly any legislation in place or stated cases to determine what is and what is not allowed in law. RP scenarios will make it happen.
[0:53:21] mattz112: kidding
[0:53:41] lazydog905: talk with Ruth
[0:53:41] TheFiku: bro, being a cop seems so stressful

[0:54:16] Athasin: Nah dude is on 21 hours of streaming
[0:54:22] Abdoullah21: was a decision made about the Johnson issue
[0:54:33] stellarnaut: Los Santos where calling someone dad without the paperwork hurts your wallet more than trying to literally kill a cop xdd
[0:54:42] lazydog905: @abdoullah21 not yet
[0:54:48] Abdoullah21: thanks
[0:55:07] aniquilattion: how much for u to perma denzel

[1:02:53] stellarnaut: PD is going to have the same retention problem the military has xdd

[2:29:14] kb420ps: @kb420ps Well,  there is no way they can get out of it.  Johnson was standing on the sidewalk.  He wasn't J-walking or anything wrong.  He got hit by a vehicle caused by a pit move.  I think the police department will be held liable.

Because Ruth said that YOU made the decision to pit at that time (even though you were hitting a highway after and said it'd be impossible to pit, so OBVIOUSLY the officer who told you wanted you to puit now), but YOU didn't make the decision at all: you didn't ask the criminal to break the law - and you didn't even make the decision to pit.

[3:38:33] chen094: how they do you like this in feb
[3:38:33] kb420ps: The Captains are just covering their collective asses over Civil suits for wrongful injuries.  I knew this was going to happen.

[3:38:47] marneraiders: @deansocool Just wait, you did very well in the DAP talk, bringing up arguments that were understandable to the Captain and the senior officer. Suspended ≠ Fired. Just get off duty talk to some other officers.

[3:39:56] MakiWind: Slacks even asked Aziz who do you think should get a dap the one that order it.

[3:40:02] m4l1kkk: Stay train
[3:40:03] lajmenno: The result of the pit, should not be a dap, but the general safety should be the deciding factor. If you shoot someone, bullet goes through and hit another person 3 blocks down should you be liable? Don't think so..
[3:40:05] Athasin: Slacks is an OPP

[3:40:28] ComplexPandaSinger: also it was the first time, as far as i know, in the whole of the PD that a civilian was killed by a suspect's car and the person involved was immediately DAPed
[3:40:28] Zunnun: @KloudO2 Need to add one more now SAJ
[3:40:28] kb420ps: The hard truth is,  if Denzel didn't have ANY DAPs,  this one would not have hurt so much.  It's just 1.  Unfortunately,  it's the straw that broke the camels back.
