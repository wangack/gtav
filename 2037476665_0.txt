[3:27:04] mortuusintus12: @KorbenDallas815 3 uses ? he opened the first job twice
[3:27:05] despicablewebb: probably good that it degrades so not every cat and dog is here at once

[3:28:09] despicablewebb: lumber Pog go to the chiropractor and get your back fixed for tree choppin
[3:28:16] conformity2pt0: does it degrade per swipe? can’t be helping your comrades open it
[3:28:22] mortuusintus12: or it would cost you rep to get a badge so you would have to continually grind the rep  ?haha
[3:28:28] common_idiot: so you get one badge per tsunami and it degrades each job so you're limited on the number of jobs per tsunami?
[3:28:50] luvvkoa: erm
[3:28:56] MajinWo0: tgpRAH
[3:29:12] blueprint988: but only big jobs require a swipe?
[3:29:16] luvvkoa: i think it might be tsunami based
[3:29:17] mortuusintus12: @conformity2pt0 its actually good i think, cause probably limited badge but only 2 jobs available so if another group gets the badge but no job, dez can swipe for them
[3:29:25] CopperKat: Just swallow the badge whole if you get robbed gravFat
[3:29:32] isabelyes: gravFat
[3:29:40] mortuusintus12: @mortuusintus12 gets the job but no badge*
[3:29:46] oDelilah: gravJam
