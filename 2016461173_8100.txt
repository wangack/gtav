[2:40:10] clerrance: yeeyee but i couldnt afford to donate then
[2:41:21] box_inabox: i went by ted6326 back then, havnt really had the time to watch the streams since then, the after parties were legendary tho
[2:42:10] SubtleSilver: I remember the ole humble bundle days, good years
[2:42:35] clerrance: i may have been fantasticarrot, but i think i changed to clerrance before they stopped using humble bundle
[2:42:48] clerrance: don't remember exactly when though

[2:44:00] box_inabox: idk if i remember everyones usernames, been a long time
[2:44:14] box_inabox: fantasticarrot rings a vague bell
[2:44:17] clerrance: yeah same
[2:44:47] clerrance: i was most active on ravs's channel once i started using twitch seriously, but also frequented hat films
[2:45:11] clerrance: or, well, hat films first, then used twitch more once i started watching ravs
[2:45:24] box_inabox: i got to 6th most active chatter one year
[2:45:34] box_inabox: mostly in the afterparties
[2:45:40] clerrance: oh shit, nice
[2:46:12] box_inabox: was good fun
[2:46:30] box_inabox: ngl when i watch ttt now i just get confused by the new roles
[2:46:31] JaffaMod: While we're offline, check out: bokoen playing Europa Universalis IV: CHRISTMAS MEGA CAMPAGIN - Part 2: EU4 - Donations From Now Until The 29th Go To The Danish Cancer Society, Specifically Children With Cancer over at twitch.tv/bokoen !
[2:47:04] clerrance: gosh same. i've given up on every understanding the drunk
[2:47:25] clerrance: some of the traitor roles you can kinda pick up from context, but otherwise i just watch for the banter really
[2:47:46] clerrance: but i also prefer watching on cinema than directly on youtube bc i can ask questions ahahah
[2:47:55] box_inabox: im sure they were each explained in the first videos they each apeared in but theres so many to catch up on now
[2:48:07] clerrance: ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯
[2:48:12] box_inabox: haha thats fair
[2:48:47] Ziffer777: I think the drunk becomes an innocent after a few minutes but if all the traitors die before that time is up they become a traitor
[2:49:09] box_inabox: and all the special weapons
[2:49:14] clerrance: oh what okay that's cool
[2:49:20] gman049: If there is a living drunk, and all of 'one side' has died, it joins the 'losing' side as an extra player
[2:49:22] clerrance: thanks @ziffer777 !!
[2:49:26] box_inabox: thats pretty cool

[2:49:34] clerrance: Noted
[2:49:41] box_inabox: in werewolf its kinda random what the drunk becomes
[2:49:47] gman049: If after a set amount of time players on both sides are still alive, drunk then joins a random team
[2:50:31] box_inabox: ah fair
[2:50:35] gman049: Addition - there's also a chance for the drunk to become a jester or another brown role if switching while both sides are still alive
[2:50:41] Ziffer777: Lol the best way to get the correct answer on the internet is to give an incorrect answer
[2:50:59] box_inabox: there are other brown roles?
[2:51:13] clerrance: thanks @gman049 !!
[2:51:17] box_inabox: @Ziffer777 too tru XD
[2:51:18] gman049: Mad Scientist. Shadow.
[2:51:38] gman049: and the rare Mud Scientist LUL
[2:51:52] AdmiralAlkex: santas elf?
[2:51:52] box_inabox: mad scientist makes zombies right?
[2:51:55] Wittlock: Mud Scientist the best yogP
[2:52:13] gman049: @box_inabox Yes
[2:52:47] box_inabox: are zombies the only black role?
[2:52:54] gman049: Santa's Elf is also brown
[2:53:15] clerrance: hi wittlock melonc3Luvster
[2:54:05] Wittlock: @clerrance yogR peepoWave
[2:54:54] box_inabox: oh and a clown, thats new to me too
[2:55:13] box_inabox: is that like a mini jester?
[2:55:26] gman049: clown is a type of jester - it acts like a jester until all of one team is dead
[2:55:57] gman049: then it's revealed and tries to kill the 'winning' team
[2:56:02] gman049: killer clown

[2:57:06] firefighter1715: 1 raiders from firefighter1715 have joined! 
[2:57:09] gman049: you can safely kill a clown anytime, but it doesn't do damage while hidden so there's a chance you might accidentally kill a jester
[2:57:54] box_inabox: aahh i see
[2:57:58] box_inabox: sneaky
[2:58:40] JaffaMod: We're now going for an ad break that will last up to 5 minutes. Make sure you subscribe ( twitch.tv/yogscast/subscribe ) to not see them anymore!
[2:59:06] box_inabox: is there like a page that keeps track of all these?
[3:00:25] gman049: Just found one, just google yogscast ttt wiki and the first result
[3:00:36] gman049: can't post link or I'll be timed out
[3:00:48] box_inabox: ofv
[3:00:50] box_inabox: ofc
[3:00:55] box_inabox: ty

[3:01:55] Ziffer777: That wiki doesn't seem to be fully up to date
[3:02:08] Ziffer777: The Marshall isn't on there for example
[3:02:31] box_inabox: anything will help given how far behind i am XD
[3:03:26] box_inabox: its been at least 8 years
[3:03:32] JaffaMod: Want to support the streamer and the Yogscast? 75% of donations go directly to the streamer! https://twitch.streamlabs.com/yogscast
[3:03:57] gman049: it's just a community page - if it's out of date then anyone can update it
[3:04:16] box_inabox: first big stream i missed was the datlov event.. after that it was a slow downward spiral of getting more and more out of touch as employment sucked up all my free time
[3:05:11] Ziffer777: Cupid, Elf and Mud Scientist as well
[3:05:26] gman049: wellll, you have work to do then :)
[3:05:30] box_inabox: what they do?
[3:05:45] box_inabox: haha yh, would be nice to get back in touch
[3:06:02] box_inabox: my people, are not my people anymore XD
[3:06:12] gman049: Cupid is a 'jester' role which can make two players a pair of lovers who win if they are the only survivors (cupid wins with them)
[3:06:37] box_inabox: ooo
[3:06:41] box_inabox: i like that
[3:06:43] Ziffer777: It's quite rare
[3:06:44] gman049: Elf is like a zombie role, converts other players into elves
[3:07:05] gman049: mud scientist does it's own thing playing its own game, just 'scans' props and things around the map
[3:07:13] box_inabox: what if you get both?
[3:07:31] box_inabox: do you all keep switching forever?
[3:07:42] box_inabox: i guess untill one team gets everyone
[3:07:55] gman049: it's a role created as a joke, because Osie misread 'Mad Scientist'
[3:08:11] gman049: It's never come up I think, zombies and elves in the same round
[3:08:35] Ziffer777: Not that I remember off the top of my head
[3:08:57] Wyrd_Oh: Welp I think we know which video needs to go on next
[3:09:04] T2Needles: They usually disable the roles on spawn and only appear if a Random mat enables it.
[3:09:20] gman049: the one where they explain all the new roles? :D
[3:09:20] Archeraplyxa: Pirate ship building!
[3:10:32] JaffaMod: Want to support the streamer and the Yogscast? 75% of donations go directly to the streamer! https://twitch.streamlabs.com/yogscast
[3:10:38] box_inabox: so the right randomat and a mad scientist and were in the money
[3:11:26] Wyrd_Oh: I think some of the role changing randomats also swap out roles that don't work with them, so it might be something that's already accounted for
[3:12:44] box_inabox: oh but that would be so fun
[3:14:31] clerrance: duncan's hysterical laugh of misery LUL
[3:14:48] box_inabox: a great ending tile
