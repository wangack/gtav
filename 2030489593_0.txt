[1:22:06] Crafty_Crystal: just being fair and hearing all sides and fighting for things they need is a good enough platform.
[1:22:32] IchibaToll: I think Happy wanted to do some similar stuff to Nick.  Reimbursement for expenses, more equipment, maybe a helicopter.
[1:22:43] Insaif: Nick is legit a good choice for the position. Liked by both EMS and doctors, but not specifically affiliated with them while still knowing what they need and how the jobs work.

[6:58:58] traviebear: So 2 medium stairs and a landing
[6:59:03] MyNameisTiff_: You're probably have to build an l-shape staircase.
[6:59:05] Maaaadi: @PacMan419 shift click something i think

[6:59:39] AshuraX13: Those seem a lot taller
[6:59:39] SetraLynn: Mmm. Yeah, maybe that's why the small floor options. Hmmm
[6:59:41] A_Humble_Wooper: Could you bury part of it in the floor if it's too tall?
[6:59:44] Insaif: Maybe just the perspective?

[7:07:29] Gobukiller: Torture room under the stairs feels like it would make sense
[7:07:33] Carbonfated: reggie could live under the stairs
[7:07:36] AntiochChouteau: I think one bedroom could be upstairs even.
[7:07:44] doc_sharon: true

[7:20:40] Insaif: Oohhh, that could be neat.
[7:21:04] fattydelrey: oooh oke
[7:21:06] paullt2: Secret tunnel katesSong
[7:21:10] vegasbrent: You could probably easily cobble together an L staircase in the corner by doing boards shorter than a full partial stair and then one of those half stairs
[7:21:12] AshuraX13: What if you did tiny stairs to lead to floor even with the bulkhead? katesHm
[7:21:23] doc_sharon: gotcha NODDERS
[7:21:50] Insaif: @vegasbrent Yeah, it sounds like 2 half stairs and a small floor for a landing would work well for an L-shaped stair way.
[7:21:52] xX_Before_The_Dawn_Xx: I'm thinking the stairs should go down from the wall across the door
[7:22:23] Insaif: My grandparents had a house that opened into a kitchen from the garage.
[7:22:35] doc_sharon: entering through the kitchen gives off a warm vibe NODDERS
[7:22:39] VTMonster: yeah, I agree
[7:22:40] Insaif: My current house also enters the kitchen from the garage.

[7:22:54] KarnEvil: My parents house, the "front door" opens into the living room, and we never used it.  we used the side door, which entered into the kitchen.
[7:22:56] MrSpiny: i can visualize a few good layouts - wish there was an easy way to configure it
[7:22:56] miliitrcz: katesNoted
[7:22:57] Thorn104: and put a couch infront of it so its not useable? xD
[7:23:18] Insaif: Yeah, our front door enters into a foyer with the dining room to the right.
[7:23:19] VTMonster: We almost never use the actual front door in my house
[7:23:36] kangg: Hmmge
[7:23:42] Carbonfated: @VTMonster same
[7:23:42] JovanMaxis: Yep. Our front door growing up entered to a landing to either go downstairs or continue to the living room. We used the side door straight off the deck into the kitchen most of the time.
[7:23:47] GenuineMind: I feel like the walls are one of those things where you'll have to mask it with wall additions
[7:23:52] doc_sharon: katesAw
[7:23:53] Insaif: Oh, nice view.
[7:24:04] AshuraX13: That is a great view of Chillead

[7:25:26] shadow_walker_2: i would be able to do that honestly, I can try figuring something out but i'll need to redownload the sims and etc

[7:28:09] A_Humble_Wooper: Oooh, good thinking rock.
