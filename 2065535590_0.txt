[3:57:03] Myki_Cameda: @Fiisky The first bonus was for increase speed, which definately does effect the mosely runs.  the higher payout that came later we never really saw tested. could be mosley or the care sales

[4:56:31] Khaza_: Kinda doesn't make sense to get into war over May
[4:56:33] Fr0stwav3: back Violet for Violet, ignore the Mayumi connection
[4:56:44] kessy1893: its gonna come down what mary expects if its crew over everthing or if mary is cool with ppl putting other stuff over the gang

[4:57:13] doccthunder: OMEGALAUGHING bro is talking like hes in jurassic park lmao
[4:57:18] cuyliebear: Kind of a weird spot of do you back Violet because of the gang structure you want, or do you want to not waste gang resources with on someone who you feel pushed you away
[4:57:24] FriskiestSpoon: but then doesn't it get sticky if Violet always acts if something happens to May and brings KC in
[4:57:25] stylzo_: you basicly cant back her up not after the info from Alex too about the notHOA. kinda hands tied imo

[4:58:17] eborcurean: the talking to the district was like burning a bridge, not impossible to come back from but like a major effort from her
[4:58:18] CCGReaper3: MONKA
[4:59:00] DJDoyleOfficial: PopCorn
[4:59:01] FIunkifer: Its also a rough spot for violet because she cant defend mayumi without involving KC
[4:59:05] PatrickMaybe: i think backing up violet would be a way to kind of kill may with kindness since she’s acting like the one who was wronged. it would be a “you could’ve had this” sort of thing
[4:59:08] cyrusfrog91: eatt
