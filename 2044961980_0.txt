[7:35:02] Celesia: If someoen is down and no one is coming to help them, they can choose to respawn themselves
[7:35:11] Legend102t: @Celesia do they get to remember everything?
[7:35:14] Thallo_Auxo: They can 911 and RP as a local to request aid. Or they can wait for a while and use local EMS but would have no memory of the event.
[7:35:19] iamSamm_: sometimes they can also do an anonymous 911 as if they are a local stumbling across the body.
[7:35:38] keREdaU: streamer look after yo self TANTIES
[7:35:40] Legend102t: ahhh noice, thanks chat
[7:36:07] Celesia: like sometimes people will be down on a dirt road and they'll RP hikers coming by that saw them
[7:36:50] Thallo_Auxo: Some people have waited hours if there is a chance they may be found
[7:37:02] keREdaU: ive seen a streamer wait on a beach for hours for locals to walk by so they could local 911
[7:37:19] Legend102t: @Thallo_Auxo yeh, thats what it was, but i wasent exactly sure how NP worked with being down and not found. Thanks for clearing it up for me =)
