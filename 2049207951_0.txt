[0:27:08] emporio_king: its the rental car i think
[0:27:09] Wave_TF: I'm really bummed about Cohdi
[0:27:09] oofinside: people saying that hes doing it with out an RP, just pure loot boxing
[0:27:10] Unbenchkenchh: he lootboxed a criminal with a 30k fine in there inventory took a pic and put it back

[0:27:13] BreezyBri: is cohdi the one that removed the splint so Harry wouldnt get a 30k fine?
[0:27:15] Bushwick78: @SSidner no
[0:27:17] Aneemix: conflict RP with police as a viewer never seems like fun to me, because of the power imbalance of the relashionship on the server.

[0:27:34] randyrandoe: K and Romney are being lawyers and criminals at the same time to do it for the RP where the cops are just jumping straight to. We've got to persecute them and take everything that they have and not trying rp nearly as much
[0:27:35] tylerallen07: when’s den back?
[0:27:36] Cthyllah: from others point of view i guess it seem liked his character was griefing and not rping

[1:05:32] n8dogg03: terry frisk
[1:05:36] bobbybedstains: everyone on scene shoudlve been detained not just one group
[1:05:37] DEVIL_Z666_: grey searched and frixed when he was gsr negative and not given medical yet
[1:05:39] oofinside: Waiting peeTime @wizpixel
[1:05:39] McDuFFerson: Viv Grey decided to frisk him while getting medical
[1:05:40] ArenaKrusher: it was just bad scene control, Ramee was shouting at Slacks to distract him and it worked
[1:05:40] GBRboyryan: pretty much people shot him then ratted on him
[1:05:41] PietertjeNL: died in car
[1:05:41] mattchutt: @hosseinfel lol
[1:05:42] kaexium: viv said that its standard procedure to frisk then from that searched and found the gun @EsfandTV
[1:05:42] rhino608: they stopped cpr to frisk him
[1:05:44] tr0kgaming: responding to shots fired
[1:05:45] sixoddeight: he is the victim
[1:05:45] Naphtax: are you always supposed to frisk and search victims?
[1:05:46] Lord_Legolas: someone snitched that he has a gun and Viv frisked him @EsfandTV
[1:05:47] Axro_: kebunPalm
[1:05:47] BushyMcmuffin: @EsfandTV what earphones do you use ?
[1:05:48] singsyng: Mr. K's anger at the police is poorly directed, he should be after the DoJ as PD only enforces their laws
[1:05:48] dreggy69: mr wouldve been frisked even if the situation was handled perfectly
[1:05:51] Cyno_R: He said he is mad bc nothing happened to the others that held ramee hostage
[1:05:53] eigenbro: gsr before cpr
[1:05:53] MoohamedAlii: he was found with gun shot wounds so he got searched for a weapon
[1:05:54] Lucsvm: @EsfandTV just let it go
[1:05:54] oofinside: mhm
[1:05:55] Texanson: by that logic hes dead why frisk him
[1:05:55] dreggy69: mr k*
[1:05:55] SgtHeadbuster: kebunPalm
[1:05:56] PoeWrit: The mr.k experience
[1:05:56] Kaztiell: mr K fucked around and found out, I dont know why its big deal just cause its him
[1:05:57] Verion: @EsfandTV he got shot and was GSR positive, which is why she frisked hi
[1:05:58] DEVIL_Z666_: he was gsr negative
[1:05:58] EddieMakes: I can see why they're really pissed because they built up so much, but its good RP because hes being setup
[1:06:00] genesissukehiro: who got banned ??????
[1:06:01] shae__void: he was incapacitated at the time when he was frisked and searched, and gsr tested i believe
[1:06:01] wawawawawa: @NLRubberDucky he had his hand up, and still used the radio OMEGALAUGHING ICANT
[1:06:01] Kryt1k4l: gsr before cpr
[1:06:02] BelllGoR: they let mary and yeager leave the scene
[1:06:04] Q_Neaux: i thought gsr negative meant no search is needed
[1:06:04] bobbybedstains: they stayed for the dead LuL
[1:06:05] vedysuace: GSR BEFORE CPR
[1:06:08] eldiablowed: not everyone on the scene was detained/GSR
[1:06:08] puppietreats: EZ fuck around and find out
[1:06:10] jb11166: if ur being realistic then a man that’s just been shot in head wouldn’t be gsr’d and searched before getting medical attention
[1:06:10] zaddy_fps: he was gsr negartive
[1:06:11] Nickomongo: his issue was that they only went after him right?
[1:06:11] bechcity: @EsfandTV, Ruth just went over the frisk SOP in the meeting while you were texting
[1:06:12] madhatterui: @EsfandTV https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2047397087?t=2h42m33s
[1:06:12] bobbybedstains: all of em
[1:06:13] balshifer: he was the victim
[1:06:14] komplike: like you know kekw
[1:06:14] zaddy_fps: gsr dont prove nothing
[1:06:14] n8dogg03: terry v ohio  is in the LS constitution
[1:06:14] guilt_: @Kaztiell you'll get flamed for this, but you're correct
[1:06:14] Kalious78: he didnt care about the search, he cared they never followed up with the mosleys accusations @esfandtv he had no gsr and said they did it
[1:06:15] icephrogg: but mr k was shot in head and needed treatment
[1:06:15] Bl1ndracer007: @EsfandTV  esfand you are a madman
[1:06:15] Lofty916: Gsr = gun shot residue
[1:06:16] 13nox__: @Verion he was gsr negative
[1:06:17] Percolatorx: crims get mad when cops do there job OMEGALAUGHING
[1:06:18] ShadowSithBane: they let everyone leave though.
[1:06:18] ayoookobe: @kaztiell cause that’s not how the law works buddy
[1:06:19] maestro__21: He was GSR NEGATIVE
[1:06:20] Sathure: They had two different groups saying either side had a gun. So the frisk was warranted. However they should of frisked the other party as well. Not just Ramee and Mr K
[1:06:20] genericusernameuno: He was negative for gsr, and then frisked. The argument is that after being negative for gsr there is no longer rs to frisk.
[1:06:22] Texanson: hes dead???????????????????? lmao what
[1:06:24] Cat_God22: gir negative it was shots fired tho right
[1:06:25] yarlodin94: i think the issue is that they are not following up on the other people Mr.K was talking about and said he was shot by these people and no investigating on them is done
[1:06:25] DemiNick: i think mr.k is more mad at no one is going after the people who shot him
[1:06:25] biggestflex: @EsfandTV only problem is that they let the other people leave
[1:06:25] Reserter1938: there was like 6 suspects
[1:06:25] zaddy_fps: gsr negative
[1:06:26] Belvai: @BelllGoR they fled, get it right
[1:06:27] Honorspren: im late, did he Sam. Jackson ever wake up?
[1:06:28] Janizki_Fin: @Verion he was gsr neg but vivv got a statement that he had a gun and held up yager
[1:06:28] grntcr: They only frisked him though
[1:06:28] MrYeOLDsNIPeR: "Detain Everyone On Site"
[1:06:28] DezalbM: if you're detained you get frisked if you get found with a bulge you get searched simple as.
[1:06:29] Grilbur: Idk how he wasn't gsr positive though he literally shot his gun
[1:06:29] NLRubberDucky: @NLRubberDucky he was on the phone when he got held up buddy
[1:06:30] PoeWrit: The shins
[1:06:30] sixoddeight: but they allowed the ones with knifes to leave
[1:06:30] Waterbottels: But they didnt detain everyone, they let half the peopel go
[1:06:32] Leafyerick: @EsfandTV I think his point was he was shot multiple times, downed, and was GSR negative and they still frisked him
[1:06:32] puppietreats: he was going after a trash truck and chat still saying he’s the victim ICANT
[1:06:33] KansasDan620: They let everyone else go that was on scene lol without checking them
[1:06:33] MacheteBandit: he was gsr negetive and ems was working on him
[1:06:34] thatclubdj: He posed no threat
[1:06:34] Corrupt_Dreams: he was majority irritated because not everyone was detained and searched
[1:06:34] ShadowSithBane: they only detained the people being held up
[1:06:35] hosseinfel: you have to see it
[1:06:35] Texanson: yeah lets frisk the dead guy
[1:06:35] ergofoe: what is he doing lmao
[1:06:36] sixoddeight: corrupt cops
[1:06:37] dudemanbroo: @EsfandTV I watched it last night after the shit show to see why he was so mad, he tried to kidnap yaegar and didnt see the other group 2 cars back, got downed
[1:06:38] Rabidwizardeye: unfortunately only went after k
[1:06:38] ayoookobe: he’s dead and gsr negative, what cause do you have to frisk him?
[1:06:40] SgtHeadbuster: They neta searched him
[1:06:40] shae__void: PASGHETTI KEKW
[1:06:41] rhino608: they just “forgot “ to detain the shooters
[1:06:41] BelllGoR: @BelllGoR did they chase them?
[1:06:41] mattchutt: 100%
[1:06:42] Texanson: its irrelevant to who shot him??????????????????
[1:06:43] bobbybedstains: so if they all where detained?? why did they let  the other ppl go
[1:06:43] aspectofdaze: @EsfandTV i thought you were taking the day off
[1:06:43] SolusOA: yoo Cornwood
[1:06:43] Slim_Shady_Mcgrady: they could see ppl fleeing when they arrived
[1:06:43] gaminggamer773: its only legal if you consider the rs from the witness "statement" as being given in good faith
[1:06:44] timedoggg: but they didn't detain everyone
[1:06:45] spartacus1j: he shot himself duh
[1:06:45] madhatterui: @EsfandTV watch this https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2047397087?t=2h42m33s
[1:06:45] tr0kgaming: you had RS not to frisk but to GSR
[1:06:45] Kalious78: he didnt care about the search, he cared they never followed up with the mosleys accusations @esfandtv he had no gsr and said they did it to get mary caught
[1:06:46] Q_Neaux: but thats the thing... only Mr K and Ramee only got detained on the scene
[1:06:46] Winttyrr: @EsfandTV Mr. K was never mad that he got searched and detained. it was that no effort was made to search for the other party
[1:06:46] Axro_: no everyone wasn’t detained. they let 3 people with knives holding a hostage go.
[1:06:46] meganuskon: Wait you don't need a warrant? Isn't that illegal search and seizure?
[1:06:47] KoalaTeaz: Mr. K is mad that they let others go without checking anyone. Not that he got frisked
[1:06:48] Jerti_: nice ID
[1:06:49] Loth_nl: Are you not detained!!!????
[1:06:49] davideil: I'm dizzy from all this running forsGullywits
[1:06:50] Kaztiell: @ayoookobe it is
[1:06:51] gordies08: he was down so he was not a danger to anyone so they had no reason to frisk him
[1:06:51] johnnypolk: whats the point in gsr if you’re gonna search anyways
[1:06:52] Marthentic: Yes but the problem was not everyone was detained. and that was is issue and why he went crazy
[1:06:53] Wicketw: I think he accepts getting caught with the gun. It's that he was murdered and no one did anything about it.
[1:06:55] Sofakingg: Cops rolled up to the scene with rammer being held up and 3 people running to motorcycles and 1 car speeding away while cops pointed a gun at rammee
[1:06:56] zuperman270: his main complaint was why did they not chase after the other group
[1:06:56] Prepper_Jack: @Grilbur He didn't.. he had multiple shots at him, though
[1:06:56] bea1z: mhm
[1:06:57] Mr_0wen: They let everyone go apart from ramee and mr k LUL
[1:06:57] puppietreats: @thatclubdj he was literally going after sanitation, who have reported the crimes
[1:06:59] brikbeans: the investigation must come first
[1:06:59] StormiNyan: chat gonna be weird again SAJ
[1:07:01] bea1z: mhm I love maths
[1:07:01] wavy__________________: SOP?
[1:07:01] Joongi_: Mr. K died? kekw
[1:07:03] Apollose_: she stopped cpr though to frisk.
[1:07:03] yinzer_houdini: should you not asking who shot him?
[1:07:04] Texanson: ok who shot him sdhould have been the priority? wtf do yall mean?
[1:07:07] daniel01927291: so in the real world if someone is bleeding out after getting shot they wouldn’t get frisked @esfandtv
[1:07:07] HistoriesPiston: essaying peeTime
[1:07:08] Jrey000: I think the problem is that they let other people leave... so that makes him feel like it was unjust
[1:07:08] stuey_drake: I’m just gonna let people know if I’m lying on the ground bleeding out and someone puts me in cuffs instead of medical, I am 100percent haunting that MF!
[1:07:08] DuskHymns: procedure
[1:07:08] scorpionblue: why did a victim get killed? that's a bit weird
[1:07:09] avixilo: a specific formula/flow chart
[1:07:10] jay2seam: like PEMDAS
[1:07:10] Prodigy46: I dont think it matters if he was gsr neg right? They still gonna search cause he was in a shootout
[1:07:10] rameesdoordash: He's down and gsr negative, he shouldn't have been searched.
[1:07:10] Half_Ghost: i think Mr.K was just arguing the point of what orders happened, he wasnt mad about getting caught with the gun
[1:07:11] Najb0lji: Siobhan was saying they should get medical first before getting frisked and that set him off @esfandtv
[1:07:12] Apollose_: it’s grey 100%
[1:07:12] Thraxton1: He tried to hold up Yaeger and Yaegers buddies shot him. Classic  FAFO
[1:07:12] Phil_RM: @Kaztiell i think he's more upset because the others involved didn't get followed up on when he snitched
[1:07:12] Grilbur: @prepper_jack watch his pov he did
[1:07:12] bobbybedstains: they hyper focused the easy ppl and let all the ppl who had weapons run
[1:07:13] WeijiBeng: "x did it" Aware
[1:07:13] AndreSays: @EsfandTV it's like 2x+8 = 59 solve for x
[1:07:14] wawawawawa: @NLRubberDucky and what would happen if you kept using the phone ???, youd get instant shoot buddy ICANT
[1:07:16] woolfdesign: Honestly, I think everyone should watch the clip to learn what could have been done better and what was done correctly
[1:07:16] madhatterui: @EsfandTV https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2047397087?t=2h42m33s
[1:07:17] wavy__________________: lack of experience
[1:07:17] jtesta129: but only ramee and k were detained not everyone
[1:07:17] huhddee: PRECEDENT
[1:07:18] rhino608: k’s entire point is they were the only detainees
[1:07:18] HeyMeghan: mr k is mad that the people who shot him got away bc Johnson prioritized the victim bc he was the only cop on scene. @esfandtv
[1:07:18] Clivent: its in your clip that you had about cornwood not being on duty no????
[1:07:19] brikbeans: my brain is growing
[1:07:20] bea1z: Classic bobby
[1:07:21] Graudenzo: Frisk Before Search smh
[1:07:21] puppietreats: OMEGALUL bobby
[1:07:21] Ned15: @apollose_ don't lie lmao
[1:07:21] Dmany1: the thing that made him mad was Johnson watched people run away then they all arrested the one that got shot
[1:07:22] Cordysan: essaying essaying
[1:07:23] luisvansar: everyone needs to just watch jonhsons view it explains alot
[1:07:23] quartercabin: biggest problem with that, the cops let the other suspects go and hard focused on k and ramee
[1:07:24] Texanson: common sense and you werent there, they fucked you guyys
[1:07:24] mizkifsrecedinghairline: I can't imagine being a cop in this game for any length of time.
[1:07:26] maestro__21: If he was GSR negative and the other group is snitching that should make them suspected to be the other party, and he was gsr negative, so check them???
[1:07:27] temporal_archer: WOOW procedure is a science
[1:07:28] jce1220: his frustration was that the 8 people who jumped him literally just drove off with no police chase
[1:07:29] StormiNyan: Susge archer
[1:07:29] woolfdesign: It was just so chaotic
[1:07:30] HerrWienerschnitzel: Think they anoyed because a few got targeted and others were not detained/searched.
[1:07:32] homiebear17: i mean K never was frustrated because the other party involeved were let go
[1:07:32] Prepper_Jack: @Grilbur I watched his stream, and watched the vod.. he did not shoot
[1:07:32] FvmousAce_: sad day for Murphy
[1:07:34] pooh_guttah: I’d generally disagree - any shooting you should investigate EVERYONE that’s on scene. The fact the cops let go the guys who were witnessed by PD w/ knives out holding Ramee up is just.. bad police work. RP or not lol
[1:07:35] Kaztiell: @Phil_RM but why do we care if a crim is upset, (not the streamer)
[1:07:36] Slim_Shady_Mcgrady: no one investigating why he was shot or who shot him
[1:07:36] ben_v_art: Prison gonna be popping this week lol
[1:07:36] ImmaPanda1283: @Grilbur he didnt. he pointed his gun the got shot then started to drive away.
[1:07:37] uhBrody: the problem is they ignored the other people on scene and have still yet to do anything about investigating them further
[1:07:37] Apollose_: I love the RP that’s going to come from it all though.
[1:07:39] knowlightnofear: With the Mr. K situation, I dont think anyone (including mr k) really belives he was inappropriately frisked, the error that he was correct in talking about, was that other people on scene were allowed to drive away
[1:07:40] catloyalist: Watch what Nick said about Cops because I think thats the citys thoughts at the moment.
[1:07:42] AsuniRS: "how many of ya" bro where do you think you're standing in front of
[1:07:43] Lord__Gen: It's really hard for the Criminals to RP around that though. They can just go around targeting people with guns to have them removed from opposite gangs. Not saying pd was wrong, just something to think about for the sake of RP
[1:07:43] McDuFFerson: I think the issue was that they didn't detain anyone else on scene except for Ramee and K. The police saw 2 bikes and a car leaving the scene and Ramee was screaming that the guy on the bike shot lol
[1:07:45] spicyville: BabyRage my streamer lost BabyRage my streamer lost
[1:07:46] Skittnator: DEMOCRACY MANIFEST
[1:07:47] Waterbottels: I think the issue is the PD is looking for the Gun that shot him... In his house?
[1:07:47] gordies08: they should have detained everyone no one should have been allowed to leave the scene everyone should have been tested for gsr
[1:07:47] dirtiestcrimeboi: @Dmany1 he literally arrested ramee who was being held up lmao
[1:07:47] bea1z: OMEGALUL
[1:07:48] Exotic_Soul: LuL
[1:07:49] bobbybedstains: @Grilbur THE COPS DONT KNOW THIS THO
[1:07:50] luxxen1: It was legit for him to get frisked, that's what lead to it. Crims just get mad when they finally get caught doing their crimes.

[1:07:58] NLRubberDucky: @NLRubberDucky apparently not, because he didnt pal
[1:08:00] puppietreats: @immapanda1283 don’t point ur gun at people then lol
[1:08:00] verisios: they went so hard on K but what about the guys who literally committed attempted murder have they been raided

[1:08:05] Leafyerick: @EsfandTV I think the bigger thing was from K and Ramee POV there was no effort made to go after the people who shot him
[1:08:06] ZICOforYURI: liverpool lol
[1:08:06] Sofakingg: Rammer was yelling at cops to chase the fleeing vehicles while they pointed gun at him.....
[1:08:09] DrWetbone: flag him mr wood
[1:08:09] Kalious78: @esfandtv why you focusing on the search n ignoring the reason ??? he had no gsr and said mosleys planted it on him n shot him. they ignored that n never followed up on it. thats mr.ks beef

[1:08:18] JoeFoo: it was a sht show at the start when pd pulled up
[1:08:19] Switchblade142: Ppl in this chat don't understand that the PD doesn't have near enough numbers to do everything they're asking
[1:08:19] yarlodin94: @esfand Mr. K said he was ok with the fact that he got cought with the gun his issue was that hew as the person with a gun shot wound and no one is getting charged or in trouble for it
[1:08:19] thatguydancingintheclub: its not only us saying this people act like its all chatters bieng wierd
[1:08:20] cuphandss: @McDuFFerson there wasnt enough cops on scene to chase the others when they fled

[1:08:40] forgotheals: @Sillyanne fr
[1:08:40] Waterbottels: I thought the issue was they cooked up the warrant while he was lawyering to get him off the case
[1:08:41] Thraxton1: @quartercabin Because the other guys ran of in vehicles and they dont have enough cops to both chase and secure the scene. In that situation securing the downed guy takes precedent

[1:18:40] forgotheals: They would have to actually code everything in the prison... and appoint a warden for that to work @EsfandTV
[1:18:41] puppietreats: @kalious78 brother….. moseleys has been communicating with the police and reporting that she’s being harassed by K…. but hey i guess common sense is RP logic now

[1:18:42] LeonardoDiCaprisun_: 5 months is nothing ngl
[1:18:42] MisterTroubleMaker: it should be hours
[1:18:44] Cordysan: Criminals can basically do whatever they want with zero repercussion. At worst they get a slap on the wrist pepew
[1:18:45] Zelaphiel: They ask for bench trial, and waste everyones time. Just to complain when they lose about how long it took so they dont have to be locked up and serve their time. You ask for a bench trial you should deal with it if you lose.
[1:18:45] PandaNomsBamboo: 999999 months later LOL
[1:18:45] DatDudeLARKIN: It's literally free food and water. LUL

[1:18:51] notColt45: It's dumb, just take your l
[1:18:51] Zewelly: @puppietreats no one cares about the charge of the gun, its the fact the pd failed to find the shooters. shooters are still out, they have a witness, a cop was literally on scene during the stickup
[1:18:51] ben_v_art: you'll be out by the time you walk to the gate lol
[1:18:51] McDuFFerson: just get up and get a drink or something lol its 5 minutes
[1:18:52] DismalShark: the scaling for that should be adjusted as time goes by
[1:18:52] jsmith0808: I think for some people it’s about not having a record
[1:18:52] Grumplestillskin: doing crime and constantly involving yourself with PD at the same time is a good way to get arrested
[1:18:53] Hawaiianbreado: 5 mins is crazy to get butthurt about
[1:18:54] CowWizardMoneyGang: @hi_iamvuzzy a car

[1:18:55] csteele2020: liberal snowflake police department
[1:18:56] cbell829: FUCK ROUND AND FINE OUTTTTT!!!!
[1:18:57] wawawawawa: @NLRubberDucky wtf are you saying, the cops themself didnt rp properly ICANT someone was bledding out in the floor and they are gsr testing them, who would want to rp with them you just letting ppl die on the floor
[1:18:57] Raisha_Delos: So wait what's the equivalent ingame time for a DAP fall off?

[1:19:01] Prepper_Jack: So K was held for the equivalent of like 30 years because cops couldn't figure out GPS
[1:19:01] MarUlberg: Its RP.. You should still be upset at 5 months.
[1:19:05] tinywulf: give them 5000 months maybe they will stop doin crime
[1:19:05] Stev00: @Evsta99 relax bro he was asking because he didnt know
[1:19:05] aztec8669: @MisterTroubleMaker its a game lol for fun
[1:19:05] histreamur: 5 mins is pointless then, start at 30 at the minimum
[1:19:05] biggestflex: i think its cause they have to find a way back lol or they want to be able to get back into rp immediately when they should have a cooldown
[1:19:06] manni377: being a felon can be play a part in people going crazy sometimes
[1:19:07] Scottycky: people dont know how to take an L gracefull
[1:19:08] BrainOnAutopilot: it takes to long to process and do reports for basically nothing
[1:19:08] kleytonbruck_br: pd officers getting 24h suspesion and crims get like 5-10 minutes
[1:19:09] jb11166: I don’t get when cops are trying to push like 120 months and ridiculous shit like that tho like this is peoples careers as well
[1:19:09] faastra: well but the rp is 5 months is 5 months right?
[1:19:09] imSteffin: Chat never says anything important just ignore us we're a series of monkeys with keyboards just pitter pattering away.
[1:19:09] mochalex: K refused to leave LUL
[1:19:10] Evsta99: Some Crims be arguing for half an hour to fight going to jail for 10 months
[1:19:10] FelipeLLs: Chatting
[1:19:11] BigSyke47: Imagine wanting to do crime but not wanting punishment for it xD
[1:19:13] SgtHeadbuster: 3.0 mindset
[1:19:13] MrYeOLDsNIPeR: @puppietreats ... don't think you've been foloowing the full story.
[1:19:14] Tickls: what they did to MR k they fucked him hard
[1:19:14] PunGnocciOh: HUH
[1:19:14] pooh_guttah: it would have been funny if you guys ignored him in the Prison 🤣
[1:19:15] reverseplatypus: judges should be concerned that these folk think they are innocent and give em lots  of time
[1:19:17] Lord_Legolas: Years are days chat
[1:19:18] legendaryqt_: k got 24hour hold
[1:19:19] BattleAlpaca: imagine everyone was like that one british guy you got with litering and jaywalking, immediately ran with it and wen to jail and was back out by the time ti would have taken to get a lawyer @EsfandTV
[1:19:19] MisterTroubleMaker: @aztec8669 yes prison rp is great
[1:19:20] PsychoJoker: Kinda bad Penny had to go civ style because shes not allowed to get an FTO til shift 2 FailFish
[1:19:21] SupportCarryy: they probably think, why bother if it's just 5mins
[1:19:21] RoosterXXIII: AUDIT THE AUDIT
[1:19:22] crowgoes: I mean K could have cooperated and been out a lot faster
[1:19:22] puppietreats: @zewelly girl what
[1:19:25] jb11166: it’s not real life people forget that but it can have real life consequences it can cost people money
[1:19:29] DatDudeLARKIN: @jukla12 Even irl 5 months is NOTHING for what he probably get arrested for.
[1:19:29] enfranchise_: HOLD UP WTF. So you get 5 months in jail and your there for 5 minutes but 10 daps is 60 days irl???? @EsfandTV
[1:19:29] docmabuut: Coulda pled guilty and have 5 min move a lot quicker
[1:19:29] yukiotzu: catJAM
[1:19:30] xxlonegunmanxx: Keep the time low, but the fines high
[1:19:31] Panos_97: @EsfandTV Cop paperwork is always more time consuming than pretty much any prison sentence
[1:19:31] LeZenon: @hi_iamvuzzy 4Head just walk or call abdul Kappa
[1:19:32] Grzna: @EsfandTV you do realize game is called grand theft auto not grand auto policing? :)
[1:19:32] shadow__rain: respectfully they need to not give time served as much and change the conversion bc it’s too short of an actual sentence
[1:19:33] driver1036: Cops get 2 months
[1:19:33] ItsExiled_: @sendu6666 u realize alot of people stream why would they halt peoples content for hours over some in game crimes what
[1:19:33] derprite: @Prepper_Jack yeah KEKW
[1:19:36] RAMEEKILLEDSAMBAAS: K got 24 hold because pD couldn't find his houses lmao
[1:19:37] Beer_30: There needs to be more stuff to do in prison. Right now it’s so incomplete and there’s no DOC
[1:19:39] aztec8669: @MisterTroubleMaker not all day great for doin a small crime
[1:19:39] itsEzePz: i mean the fact that prison is practically dead all the time doesnt help
[1:19:47] LeonardoDiCaprisun_: @histreamur its on the basis that the procedure took real long anyway, so theyre saying a reduced sentence... but i get what you mean
[1:19:50] kingjeff1: no it isn't
[1:19:51] ObiJUANcannoliii: FirstTimeChatter
[1:19:51] 1manpizza: Add more punishment if they lose a bench trial for a minor crime, 10x it Evilge

[1:19:55] puppietreats: @mryeoldsniper i guarantee you my ass has been watching TOO MUCH rp, i’ve followed this situation from the start
[1:19:55] RoosterXXIII: TOP DOWN
[1:19:56] woolfdesign: I'd love to see the prison filled with crims and Mr K starting a riot or a prison gang or something like that LUL
[1:19:56] fishmeatx: SO unbalanced

[1:20:00] Lucsvm: @Beer_30 email the devs lol LULW
[1:20:00] imSteffin: Yes nobody likes daps being 60 irl days.
[1:20:04] NLRubberDucky: @NLRubberDucky How do these transgressions keep occurring on your watch. I'm starting to feel like you're not cut out to be a member of the RP police department. You're presence is not being respected.
[1:20:05] StreamElements: Printed Cases, Platelights, and Platelight panels have landed! 🌠starforgepc.com/Esfand
[1:20:05] Asura_Shini: I feel like the time isnt as big a deal as the fines because making someone sit there can be meh but the fine allows them to continue RP while feeling the pain of getting caught
[1:20:08] surelyURjokingMrFeynman: yeah and then they hit people with 3 or 4 DAPs from one incident
[1:20:11] JamboBrenn: @Grzna BabyRage
[1:20:13] HulkDiesel: @EsfandTV Aren't the SOPs still in place to not give time served for felonies/80% for guilty? The problem is Cops keep giving time served so it is expected
[1:20:18] wavy__________________: yes men
[1:20:20] PowerTurbo: 1 dap should be one day
[1:20:22] Zewelly: @puppietreats what you mean what? there is no fairness, a PD literally shot a tanker and denied it
[1:20:24] zentsk: in days game, its 60 years, that's crazy
[1:20:26] jb11166: did cornwood get dapped from yesterday?
[1:20:27] scooberdooberty: court IRL is literally the gamble of either getting off because you were innocent or ending up with a worse outcome than if you pleaded guilty up front and either plead out or took it at face value
[1:20:27] happylagoon1: did u watch the nmp clip @EsfandTV
[1:20:28] shikari07: I feel like if they are held for a long time due to PD mess up time served can be a good thing but if its because the crim is being uncooperative than they shouldn't get time served
[1:20:30] DeadlyCupid93: why are subs soo toxic OMEGALUL
[1:20:30] Zibeex: They need Eli Thompson as sheriff LUL
[1:20:33] Mystikalrush: Months are minutes and if they state years that is days irl.
[1:20:34] Clivent: they are impementing a system to get daps removed
[1:20:34] wolfgang_86: Also imagen being a civ getting Attacked calling cops he gets arrested then 5 min later he is out of jail saying snitch and shooting him like bruh
[1:20:35] Jrey000: you want same values but not same ideas
[1:20:35] Lanolinlol: @HulkDiesel thats because processing takes so damn long OMEGALAUGHING

[1:20:53] Kalious78: @puppietreats your missing the point. even if i harass you. if you shoot me n cops find an unused illegal gun on me fine i get done for that but they should also be investigating the shooter. thats ks issue not the search finding the gun but all teh cops are doing is saying its the search. shrug

[1:21:25] MrYeOLDsNIPeR: @puppietreats then your comments are bias.... which negates a neutral conversation.

[1:21:33] Kalious78: @puppietreats suprised with the amount you talk
[1:21:35] xxlonegunmanxx: @joet1118 Crim shoots a civ 5 minutes in jail. Cop shoots a crim, fired for 60 days.
[1:21:36] pooh_guttah: @sendu6666 it’s not when the prison is empty 90% of the time.. or just 1 person. You need it to have some more people to make it work
[1:21:37] Cthyllah: I feel like people's criminal records don't come up enough as an importance either. shouldnt a criminal thats been convicted multiple times not really be able to get away with a whole lot of future crimes, considering their past and their record?

[1:28:31] warner05: @dominikun When they give out the punishments for crimes, they either issue Months or Years.  Anything with Months is Minutes.  So 75 months is 75 mins.  Other crimes get Years.  Years are a Day I believe.  So even if 24 months = 2 years, 24 months is still 24 mins.  There isn't a conversion rate with Months into Years like that.

[1:47:25] StormiNyan: @zorsstream basically they need to use it in front of a doctor or cop but they can't just walk around with them as a civ
[1:47:26] MysticCasey: See you in 30 days SLJ

[1:47:37] knowlightnofear: Can you explain why COHDI got banned for 30 days??
[1:47:39] imSteffin: @matanzlatan2000, thats the issue. If this game is the main game and main viewer source? It can kill their career lol
[1:47:40] Joongi_: @COHDI CAN'T DISPUTE IT? BRUH
[1:47:40] shawry9: @COHDI What happened
[1:47:42] spartacus1j: @COHDI You know it was because x seen it. There is a clip out there that shows his "mind blow" reaction
[1:47:44] cuspeli: how come we never see samuel jackson & CORNMAN in the same place? Susge
[1:47:44] CovenousTTV: damn condition that’s so messed up rip coco for a month
[1:47:45] Zazun_: like real life 30 days?
[1:47:45] D00kieSh0es: that does suck but @COHDI id lay low about talking about it as its in np rules to not talk about it publicly
[1:47:46] Sillyanne: Did Client actually post he was banned? Cause all I see is a pinned message and tweet saying he'd be away for 7 days, doesnt mention a ban
[1:47:46] rdogg79: Your Twitch Story is hilarious esfandLUL
[1:47:47] blaze2556: @ezrandir and thats a 30 day ban? what the fuck lmao

[1:48:04] COHDI: i talked to a captian and he said a warning was fine...
[1:48:06] COHDI: lol
[1:48:09] imSteffin: @Sillyanne, thats all I've seen too. People saying banned but him saying he'd be taking a break.
[1:48:13] brxckk_ttv: @COHDI Discord call Koil when hes online, should help out
[1:48:19] coldan01: at least make 1 day ban, 30 days is such an overreaction
[1:48:21] Sillyanne: yeah I read it as a break for 7 days, people probably assuming a ban
[1:48:27] cheebah710: esfandVIBE esfandVIBE
[1:48:28] dewwutnow: thats wild
[1:48:32] kyleeeeeee_: 30 days is too much
[1:48:32] puppietreats: @sillyanne even on reddit i haven’t seen anyone talk abt peanut being banned
[1:48:34] XtraMedium1301: @Riggoon its a pd first aid kit. its the best healing option outside of the hospital
[1:48:34] endorphinist: message them and ask "misclick"?
[1:48:35] Sillyanne: but he never mentions anything about a ban
[1:48:35] wreckadin510: LSPD Rizz
[1:48:35] GYNECHIATRIST: SHITSHOW
[1:48:35] deadbyhunting: PD short on staff > another officer gets banned for 30 days BibleThump
[1:48:36] MysticCasey: Warned the person and confiscated it so.
[1:48:41] CovenousTTV: ALL OVER AN IFAK TOO???
[1:48:41] Fozenoh: say " I got robbed by Samuel L Jackson Bitch "
[1:48:42] taraannee: pd should never get in trouble for shit a captain approves wtf
[1:48:44] TheMrGromble: Classic PD punishments
[1:48:45] forgotheals: Nah that shit is wild... Banned for 30 days for that.
[1:48:45] Lucsvm: @COHDI you got banned bc you move a ifak and take a print than move back, but "someone" react too much and you got banned
[1:48:45] BabyJoker: probably just ride out the 30 days
[1:48:47] Switchblade142: Peanut got a 7 day ban too
[1:48:48] M__Wolfe: Imagine banning someone for making a mistake. People power tripping so hard on this server
[1:48:50] COHDI: the forum says i cant request an unban for 30 days so idk, ill try
[1:48:51] LogicWeasel: Susge
[1:48:54] N_troduce: @Sillyanne Mr k said it was for the gun
[1:48:54] imSteffin: It didn't seem malicious tbh it seemed uh.. autonomous/absent minded than anything
[1:48:54] Gorirras: sorry for what? he doesn't even know why he was banned
[1:48:56] Lanolinlol: someone really hates the PD up top
[1:48:57] 0x000b: Susge
[1:49:00] jenny12gauge: IFAKs are first aid kits for severe trauma, like healing a gunshot wound bodily injuries
[1:49:03] Thraxton1: He didn't get banned for the IFAK guys, he was lootboxing a cop on a brand new character
[1:49:05] mizkifsrecedinghairline: I think we should ban more officers and make the job even less fun.  :)
[1:49:07] DeeKoiii: Can't wait for Ruth to be gone
[1:49:08] Sillyanne: @N_troduce so Client hasnt said, got it
[1:49:12] Sillyanne: 👍
[1:49:13] Diamondman121314: 30 days is crazy
[1:49:16] focustft: @Thraxton1 he literally said why he got banned earlier lol
[1:49:17] eaglezFly: @thraxton1 then esfand would be banned
[1:49:17] Gachiguru: The lootboxing of cops is getting ridiculous like Andrews said this shouldnt even happen LULE
[1:49:17] singsyng: that's such a nonsensical ban if it was accidental
[1:49:18] Im_a_sad_panda: @sillyanne people use ‘ban’ and ‘suspension’ synonymously when one tends to be more indefinite than the other
[1:49:20] icephrogg: msg koil lol
[1:49:20] surelyURjokingMrFeynman: wait so was the ifak reason a Jebait?
[1:49:21] jacksmithcje: cant be the ifak thing cos did they not figure eugene did the same thing
[1:49:22] RedpiII: Bones need to patrol with his vest on
[1:49:22] DrWetbone: I would guess since lootboxing is against server rules, multiple police getting robbed in a short time window made the mods want to take action
[1:49:23] Capn_Stew: @Sillyanne His discord account doesn't have the "account suspended" tag that Cohdi's has.
[1:49:25] N_troduce: @Sillyanne why would he say without client saying it
[1:49:26] COHDI: @Lucsvm i took the screen shot and put it in the report
[1:49:29] Lord_Ribbit: @COHDI 30 day bans are usually perma Bans tbh from what I have seen through the years
[1:49:29] EPiQ: Lol what...Client got banned?!
[1:49:30] BlazeAndConfuse: @Thraxton1 ya he made the fat guy that stole the gun from Bobby
[1:49:31] dapyman: Audio sounds fine to me
[1:49:32] Janman88: @COHDI 30 days is rough
[1:49:34] truestoryguy: Did he just ask two girls to flash him?

[1:49:58] shin5sato3: @EsfandTV @COHDI there's this comment on reddit "When the devs removed the gun he robbed and admins messaged him about it, he pulled up the forum messages on stream with a clear "this is to remain private" warning on it (they might consider this the worst offense tbh)."
[1:49:58] oofinside: 200 hour into RP, he got burn out OKEY
[1:49:59] spartacus1j: Nah k confirmed peanut is banned 7 days for robbing a cob
[1:49:59] TheLastRace: There is so much other crap and power gaming for so many other streamers, Getting banned for 30 days over a stupid IFAC is insne

[5:15:57] RoyceAronii: there was no reason to have a degree of suspicion about K but that didnt stop half the PD
[5:15:58] Scrando: Cornwood also has a crush on Mary so
[5:15:58] rhino608: except the killing of k outside her house
[5:15:58] femboysthighs: NOWAYING so you mean you CANT just break RP and watch everyones streams for full PD context
[5:15:59] BSG_Reaper20: But was treated differently
[5:16:05] 9trashpanda9: so she just dodges all due process cause shes nice
[5:16:05] matanzlatan2000: maybe she and her business are getting attacked exactly becuse they're in with PD? so crims hate them
[5:16:07] DevilDogTash: Cornwood wasn’t involved in the events that happened outside her house
[5:16:09] Wallsh_: @EsfandTV she knows how to build good relations with PD and chatters mad KEKW

[5:16:11] SteveAdeptus: Both consenting adults would need to br paid by a third party for it to qualify as pornography
[5:16:15] iDravens19: the others dont talk to the cops as much as Mary so its easier to believe the person actually communicating
[5:16:15] Connorbrow: Mr K was acting crazy while saying that, yeah
[5:16:16] jaime2b: So he shoot himself?
[5:16:18] Switchblade142: @RoyceAronii I mean he literally had a gun on him, lol why wouldnt they be

[5:16:34] xCheekz: would you be surprised ooc if you found out she was a crim
[5:16:36] MisterParry: Is Cornwood concerned a friend of the PD might be found guilty like Murphy Braun was?
[5:16:37] RoyceAronii: @Switchblade142 the suspicion came before they found it, they saw it was CG and they instantly assumed guilty
[5:16:38] Clodhoppr: @Lord_Ribbit ooc doesn't matter LUL

[8:09:37] Zooks: Police station treated as it always full of police
[8:09:37] Xen_Crypt: cashew got banned, it wasnt peanut
[8:09:38] BiggE005: It was pretty bad how he did it
[8:09:39] killogic916: I dont think any1 in CG knew @EsfandTV
[8:09:39] detergent86: loot boxing cops is against tos I guess
[8:09:40] puppietreats: @thejremyshow then you shouldn’t be saying there’s more to it lol, you know the cops don’t know.
[8:09:41] Myki_Cameda: @jakritch1 nobody at mosley's gets paid. Mary makes parts and sells them to mechanics who charge customers when they use them
[8:09:42] infintitedream: essentially power gaming
[8:09:45] risingmafia_: rip pnut
[8:09:46] NullSignal: pd's supposed to be treated as if it's a big city and full of cops all the time
[8:09:48] TeeRiot: its because for RP you wouldnt rob a police officer at a police station irl
[8:09:49] CrystalDimension: @COHDI WAIT,you are banned ? for 30 days ?
[8:09:49] oofinside: @COHDI did you found out the reason of your ban? Thinkge

[8:09:53] dreggy69: seems really arbitrary
[8:09:54] daedayz: is it like camping or something?
[8:09:54] Kelsier10: pd has to be treated like its always fully staffed with officers
[8:09:55] interp_tv: the admins all agreed idk
[8:09:56] Gachiguru: Robbing someone at the Maze Bank is bad too
[8:09:56] Galileothe1: ur supposed to rp tht its always fully staffed
[8:09:57] Hitmehn_: Gloves also dont work to hide dna

[8:10:05] crate_crate_crate: @EsfandTV What is rob outside PD?
[8:10:06] WineNot: PD is suppose to be treated as its fully staffed
[8:10:07] jessv23: "No fear in life" to rob a cop at PD
[8:10:08] Puk3s: Stuff like that is kind of grey
[8:10:08] EPiQ: Its closer to lootboxing at this point w/o enough PD to counter it
[8:10:10] taraannee: @cohdi samuel l jackson rp ain’t gonna be the same w/o terrorizing coco BibleThump
[8:10:10] captain_steve_420: it sets a prescedent that is dangerous
[8:10:11] miketwng: @CrystalDimension yeah because of Michael
[8:10:12] TheJremyShow: @puppietreats I didnt mention anything specific, just deeper, theres been way more said in chat than what i said
[8:10:12] PoisonDart11: think about it, could u rob a cop in front of pd irl? no LULE
[8:10:14] Helemok: you are supposed to rp like there are 10000 cops on duty i guess @EsfandTV
[8:10:16] OminousEinherjar: @EsfandTV In the past you RP as if MRPD is fully staffed and a lot of cops, atleast how it used to be
[8:10:16] puppietreats: peanut actually got banned for life in real life and on every platform (trust me i’m a chatter)
[8:10:17] Crosstak: You are supposed to treat PD like it's fully staffed
[8:10:17] TomatoPhalanges: chatters accuse of powergaming at literally anything
[8:10:18] Gachiguru: Not near as bad as robbing at PD though
[8:10:20] Vikarious_X: who in their right mind would rob a policeman at their own station
[8:10:20] MisterBrojangles: PD and Hospitals have always been considered "safe zones"
[8:10:23] dudemanbroo: because in reality who is dumb enough to walk up to a police department and rob an officer standing out front with a knife lol
[8:10:25] Connorbrow: @SmugPls Why is that true for PD but people power game the prison so much with no repercussions?
[8:10:25] aj42058: That's kinda dumb cause that's like the hardest place to rob a cop imo. If you can manage to rob a cop there it should be all good.
[8:10:27] oofinside: not worth the 30 days WeirdDude
[8:10:27] blazingchope: im assuming its looked at as nvl
[8:10:29] atwin10: did lil tuggz get in shit too
[8:10:29] Randog__: everything is power gaming to twitch chat lul
[8:10:30] ryonenx: @PoisonDart11, No its against the law
[8:10:32] TheMah1337: clienteBruh clienteTwerk
[8:10:32] pacifistmasochist: @esfandtv I wonder if instead of bans they could rp it out and say there are surveillance cams at pd. it’ll dissuade people and u can use stream clips in court LUL
[8:10:34] InvictoNZ: all PD are fully staffed, "roleplaying" you can wipe the pd, or rob them at a PD is weird
[8:10:34] HashtagSoBlessed: Didn’t he do it right before tsunami too? or am I wrong on that
[8:10:35] Cheexur: @cohdi nah bruh you got banned for that ifak think let’s be real

[8:10:43] inksday: @Tronno If you were on the server you could go into moseleys right now and work there and she couldnt do anything about it. So no
[8:10:50] LeonardoDiCaprisun_: @aj42058 i hear that
[8:10:51] WHATtheINTERROBANG: why does bonnie not stream when she RP's @EsfandTV
[8:10:53] Raja_Banhammer: ABOBA STATE ABOBA OWNED
[8:10:58] SilentStormAU: @COHDI all the best bro it sucks but at least its not permantly right? think of it that way :)
[8:11:05] TomatoPhalanges: ABOBA
[8:11:07] matanzlatan2000: @pacifistmasochist they should definitely do this becuse it seems like PD thing isn't even common knowledge for anyone, so its easy to make that mistake.
[8:11:08] kleytonbruck_br: @aj42058 but then people can camp there and wait for the last cop to get out, I think its to prevent this
[8:11:08] Khaosshinobi: i think i remember koil talking about it back in 2.0, the RP is that PD is always full of cops even if noone is there, you dont just walk into an army by yourself it's NVL
[8:11:10] oofinside: YEP

[9:03:40] donny_dinosaur: graduated police academy at 15  valedictorian
[9:03:41] ultramicdo: yeah slacks could be great cheif one day, but turner has the years and is better at keeping emotions out of his decisions
[9:03:42] DayTrader26: Is sheriff below a captin?
[9:03:43] spicyville: turner does shift 3 most of the stuff happens during shift 2
[9:03:43] TheGodmother: emiruDANCING emiruDANCING @FelipeLLs
[9:03:43] DonNiko99: And Turner doesnt seem very biased and is very objective about things. Not afraid of saying or doing the right thing
[9:03:46] Percolatorx: is the slj warrant done?
[9:03:47] TheLastRace: @EsfandTV Slacks has some playful time in him as well, so dont think it works for Chief of PD. Turner is pretty by the book and strict
[9:03:48] ArdentCause: I say Turner or Mcnaulty would be a great chief
[9:03:51] l_buckner: @soojeo mean
[9:03:51] sirbombabba: skill vs exp

[9:04:01] Lanolinlol: age is experience and i think that is important as hell for a chief of the popo
[9:04:04] tinywulf: turner is cool as a cucumber
[9:04:07] Chaoszero_goc: turner could be cheif
[9:04:08] owlx7: Ruth for captain!
[9:04:09] TheKingOfWit: he's the most calm and generally the most fair imo
[9:04:09] SepheronXI: but then you have cletus cornwood the best of the best esfand

[9:04:24] TheGodmother: @FelipeLLs OMEGALAUGHING
[9:04:26] SoIafar: by that logic james randall should be chief of police, he has been a polcie officer for 81 years

[9:04:32] katsuo_17: turner will be a good chief PD and a mafia boss KEKW
[9:04:33] Percolatorx: is that SLJ warrant done?
[9:04:39] SepheronXI: Cletus is the best of the best though its time to make america great again
[9:04:39] OniZetsumei: Ruth is good for RP but that kind of RP can really ruin other peoples RP faster with less effort than it takes to perfom that RP
[9:04:44] Lonestar_64: joey parm
[9:04:47] PacoChips: make ruth lead for the rp
[9:04:48] Percolatorx: ah okok cool
[9:04:52] Asterixdx: throwing slacks in the deep end of COP would actually be pretty funny tho thinking about it
[9:04:57] ArdentCause: Just log in on him and turn yourself in so you dont have to do more work lmfao
[9:04:59] JC9R_: slacks wants to patrol more so i dont think he will take chief
[9:05:00] DatDudeJakeC: If Turner was moved to CoP, I think Ruby would be a good captain replacement
[9:05:01] genesissukehiro: on top of that TURNER has the charisma of a chief  but i think cornwood does as well just not for a metro force
[9:05:02] COHDI: turner's character even looks like chief of police
[9:05:02] DrWetbone: the way this pd is going chatterbox would be the perfect chief of police
[9:05:02] the_ackman: Saab is always going to be in charge of the police behind the scene right?
[9:05:06] oofinside: mhm
[9:05:07] joe_bags_: ruth would be hilarious for the rp

[9:05:11] magnets_: saab loves patroling YEP
[9:05:17] PsychoJoker: @the_ackman hes an Admin for NP
[9:05:17] CapSobel: i didnt watch saab play baas… was it very different from slacks?
[9:05:21] l_buckner: I just want an angry hard nosed black guy as chief, for consistency to movies

[9:05:33] slim_cognito420: Cornwood's driving stats went up today
[9:05:34] Clodhoppr: I miss Baas
[9:05:34] Wooblerz: I think Penny should be Chief of Police pepeW

[9:05:35] ArdentCause: @COHDI so true he does- and his demeanor
[9:05:36] ZachFromChat: He loves patrolling, hes stressed IRL because of all this lol
[9:05:36] twilightbaseballscene: slacks is best when patrolling methinks

[9:05:51] TomatoPhalanges: Didnt Baas have a whole corruption arc at one point or am i misremembering
[9:05:52] blgsnack09: is Ruth new?
[9:05:52] ZilzGaming: you need to hop on him so they can try atleast once to catch SLJ or it wont be extended
[9:05:57] oofinside: you cant rank up if you have daps? Thinkge
[9:05:57] joe_bags_: what would andrews think about the dadgum shitshow the city has turned into lately
[9:05:57] Cthyllah: slacks is almost too emotional and conversational, turner lives and breathes pd, perfect for captain
[9:06:02] dains84: i think Ssaab said he wanted to do a detective thing for awhile, was really enjoying it the other night.
[9:06:08] sirbombabba: I honestly thought slacks was the chief when i started watching
[9:06:10] Switchblade142: I’d make De Rolo the other captain if Turner moved. would be funny as hell like North Korea

[9:06:26] PsychoJoker: @ZilzGaming a judge already approved an extension
[9:06:26] humanhere2: Lol other than ocean dumping Dundee...
[9:06:28] Paudelly: Turner is really good. Hes a little strict on the rules, fair to everyone, open door to talk to people, doesnt jump to conclusions when just hearing one side

[11:55:06] matanzlatan2000: hot take but honestly big problem is people not wanting to play, like esfand plays like crazy and gets results but everyone else plays a tiny bit for like 3 hours or something usually and then leaves, they should all grind like cornwood at least once or twice a week, if you want serious rp and build something out of it then you gotta be dedicated and that sometimes means 15+ hrs of gaming.

[11:58:53] yuubelle: cornrider
[11:58:55] matanzlatan2000: @SSJets_STC yeah, they need to improve things on many fronts, including server stuff but at the core biggest problem is people not wanting to play and leaving after like 3 hours, i've noticed that cops that play the most always get most results, cornwood, denzel, aziz, den streamed for 11 or so hours once and did a lot, then by end of the stream it was ruined by DAPs, which are another issue.
[11:58:55] ImStuckInATreeDud: PogU no captains to dap you

[12:00:18] Vengy: @Belvai I love all the captains but I feel slacks is the only one mainly active compared to Ruth and Turner which is makes it feel like what Archer brought up THEY NEED someone else to takcare of the recuiting since the captains cant keep up with it

[12:01:08] KizzyTwitchTv: Cop captains are to stricted
[12:01:08] greyjulian: it’s a fact
[12:01:08] nationas: Return of denzel will make or break the PD
[12:01:10] drfoddy: does the police department know that cornwood's going to azeroth soon?
[12:01:10] DeeterDo: why not just do it? why follow the 'code'?
[12:01:13] PokeMom019: This bike is sick 🏍️

[12:01:14] Folterun: Police Strike!
[12:01:16] genesissukehiro: like i said i dont think you have a moth to be honest and it sucks
[12:01:16] Belvai: @Vengy aye thats why archer has the right idea,
[12:01:16] PurpleAndGold: People stream 16 hours a day every single day and be like "there's nothing to do"
[12:01:17] Apocco: Yeah seems they were too picky early on and it's biting you guys in the ass now
[12:01:18] Xiraken: Buckle up?

[12:01:27] TheMah1337: why did cohdi get banned
[12:01:27] mitchgroulx1234: Burning ssaab was so I tired he fast asleep at the desk last night
[12:01:27] NasrulAshr: Yeah people is. Thing is people feel like they dont get heard enough, thats why they went to cornwood
[12:01:28] Draktyr_Gaming: 1 of the captains is still a pain in the ass
[12:01:29] GILx87: We need the dark knight soundtrack in the background. Cornman Rises
[12:01:29] GYNECHIATRIST: Hmm
[12:01:31] foryoucarter: @esfandtv where the hell has Andrew’s been?
[12:01:33] bobbybedstains: ppl are burning out but you guys wont hire ppl who only come around on cop for a couple days
[12:01:33] iwannanuhh: No way, they refuse to delegate to anyone
[12:01:33] itisacar: mhm too much work
[12:01:34] damroyalty: the PD finally has motorcycles?
[12:01:35] daddyhardtears: They're messing the fuck up then
[12:01:36] JC9R_: they dont have anyone to give power to
[12:01:38] MrBASins: di you here Coco was banned
[12:01:38] Perterter: Are PD apps not getting approved because of whitelist?
[12:01:39] RicoLoco52: think people went too hard, too fast
[12:01:39] greyjulian: the captains want to give up all control to a chain of command, just don’t have the staffing for it
[12:01:39] Mandrenn: @vengy same! that or flop!
[12:01:39] Honorspren: @EsfandTV  do you think BCSO will open in the next month?
[12:01:40] degeneratehermit: Turner has 15 interviews this week, so things are moving but slow
[12:01:40] MaNSoN6649: Kind of Sadge seeing pd fall apart
[12:01:40] Jrey000: yea Saab but what about Ruth and Tuner?
[12:01:41] TheFox0228: I mean i know my opinion doesn't mater much. But it seriously feels like the PD feels so restrictive it's really easy to feel burnt out super quick
[12:01:42] Folterun: Police should strike for more people!
[12:01:43] HavocusRex: can't when there are too many fires to put out
[12:01:43] BoogieAnimal: They are waiting for people to step up maybe?
[12:01:45] chivvyy: who do you think is throttling the hiring then
[12:01:47] party_buffalo_: i think ur full of the sheet
[12:01:47] genesissukehiro: saab is only 1/3erd of the capt.
[12:01:48] Kevz95: @iwannanuhh slacks delegates as much as possible wdym? lol
[12:01:49] Ganelon: Yea.  The first thing to happen should have been an academy director and couple others to run it and hire.  The Captains have tired to juggle too many jobs for too long
[12:01:49] DangersClose: I think problem with current Captains is we are missing the "fun" Captain, like Pred used to be.
[12:01:50] B_E_4_S_T: we all know who the problem is PepeLaugh
[12:01:51] Vengy: @Mandrenn mhm
[12:01:53] RexPappa: they want to take it very slow, but its fkn GTA, what else is gonna happen
[12:01:53] SacreDiablo: gonna hit a random local in 5
[12:01:53] itsfpstime: how did nopixel decide who will be police captains?
[12:01:56] ShadowedSeraphim: Did Cornwood ever send an official report for the judge?
[12:01:56] greyjulian: captains also want to push for new characters, which takes a lot of training and work and people
[12:01:57] FiFO915: Only good cops are Cornwood MccNulty and Shiesty
[12:01:57] shadow__rain: honestly there is too much shared control and they aren’t really unified on a lot of things which is causing problems
[12:01:57] Welshstig: Saab is admin, having to captain in rp as well is quite a lot
[12:01:59] Neekapkilla: Ssaab also says OOC that this is the vision he has for the server at least from PD side etc. so yeah unless you guys over throw him, this is it
[12:01:59] Belvai: @Kevz95 im an unimployed fat cripple i watch a LOT of gtr rp
[12:01:59] PandaNomsBamboo: love the handling just too slow
[12:01:59] bluej255: all stick, no carrot
[12:02:00] matanzlatan2000: @Vengy they do get online and i watched turners stream few days ago and hes really effective but problem is they're simply not nearly as active as cornwood is they essentially need more cornwoods to pull these long ass shifts but people don't want to either becuse they get bored of game or irl stuff, its complicated rn.
[12:02:01] daddyhardtears: If that's what they want they're getting the opposite result @EsfandTV
[12:02:01] TimmayHS: i doubt the captains have time to recruit properly
[12:02:03] DiscretionaI: Propose a Classroom MDT section @esfandtv
[12:02:04] khrow: oh ssaabb for sure does, but I dont think Turner or Ruth wanna give up control. Turner is a great leader tho
[12:02:05] gymleaderphil: essaying 󠀀
[12:02:06] TakeAChance: Slacks not doing enough and Ruth needs to be demoted
[12:02:06] Rixxey: Ohh, my God, did cornwood get a police motorcycle?
[12:02:06] SimplyOrt: crazy someone said slacks is the only active captain
[12:02:07] LeBryantJordan: imagine if wrangler was back and the gangs had a real heel to hate
[12:02:10] Lucsvm: ppl hate on Ruth makes me kind start like her character LULW
[12:02:10] TheFox0228: that was a fast 10mins lol
[12:02:11] ToyLetTreat: is this an another DAP because ur riding the motorcycle?
[12:02:11] adothouse: OOC at the end of the day it’s kinda tiring to enforce rules all day, cops need to be able to have fun RP
[12:02:13] magnets_: Susge
[12:02:14] tys0nnnnn: I appreciate the amount of effort theyre taking in trying to keep the PD proper but they gotta just hire some people to feel em out

[12:27:33] Toastbane: I don't think he would've brought a gun there, he was setting up Yaeger
[12:27:37] blahder: I feel like that whole thing was setup
[12:27:38] DannyWasNotTaken: LookUp Yikes
[12:27:38] poltergeistjedi: LUL

[12:27:47] 0nre: @EsfandTV why didnt you guys frisk both of them on scnee
[12:27:48] Switchblade142: @nimbleop Technically doesnt need to, only if they're a present threat and can only frisk, not search. He gave the crowbar he used so no real reason
[12:27:48] magnets_: Ramee doesn't have a gun rn
[12:27:48] TheLastRace: @EsfandTV Ramee was the true instigator on the ordeal
[12:27:49] vince620: @genesissanosuke you can’t spread lies
[12:27:50] magnets_: only k
[12:27:51] Kevz95: @nimbleop for what? he didnt do anything to warrant a search
[12:27:53] DannyL3tscher: what would have happened if yaeger didn't say it was defense on ramee's part though
[12:27:53] Silver_Sol_x: @Silver_Sol_x if DNA was not taken yeah someone is in trouble

[12:27:57] UncleTahko: clips aloud?
[12:27:57] LogicWeasel: Ramee somehow manages to be 1 inch away from being busted as a felon

[12:28:30] bertacharm: it seemed sus cuz why did ramee wanna talk to you before that about something but not after
[12:28:32] Synced3D: hola DadA CoWoo n chatterinos :)
[12:28:34] ZachFromChat: Hey :)
[12:28:34] DrWetbone: Ruth would’ve frisked him
[12:28:34] SwebDK: @Matuzak_ Mary never planted, K is just lieing to the police to seem more Civ
[12:28:37] KewlKittyProductions: @Matuzak_ what did Mary plant?
[12:28:39] BANGALISCH: yeager never swung, so wouldnt that make it to where you have to frisk/search ramee too?
[12:28:40] vibezz_420: yaeger doesnt stream
[12:28:44] Lonestar_64: wrong
[12:28:48] genesissukehiro: correct

[12:28:49] its_R4HUL: nope
[12:28:49] couchconner: not at all lol
[12:28:50] puppietreats: @silver_sol_x assault isn’t always a felony
[12:28:52] 13nox__: he would have frisked ramee, if the other guy didnt immediately admit that he was there to attack ramee
[12:28:52] Freddiepines: Terry v. Ohio
[12:28:55] Lonestar_64: thats wrong
[12:28:55] EPiQ: frisk = pat down
[12:28:58] party_buffalo_: u cant detain me fuckers

[12:29:12] Recon_XoX: Its a Terry Stop
[12:29:13] Angel_ofMercy: Terry frisk
[12:29:14] EvilCoatrack: Terry is frisk based on RS of crime and RS of being armed
[12:29:15] VincentsDeath: Ramee is still gov employee with no crimes, so that should have some good faith
[12:29:16] genesissukehiro: that being said when you detain someone you dont generally let them run around lol
[12:29:16] s0stin: @BANGALISCH he doesnt know that tho. and yeager admitted to attacking him...
[12:29:17] supertramp0331: who plays jeagar?
[12:29:18] bigmmoenjoyer: would that be part of law tho
[12:29:19] Liam121abc: i would have too google it
[12:29:25] Kevz95: @BANGALISCH he might have swung and missed. we never found out because yeager just insta-admitted to attempted murder basically
[12:29:26] tys0nnnnn: @supertramp0331, he doesnt stream
[12:29:26] puppietreats: YEP

[12:29:29] Sadisticmedic: Terry Frisk
[12:29:30] bobbybedstains: you cant stop terry he gone back it up
[12:29:31] iSimont: @EsfandTV Since Ramee is government employee isn't there another charge for yeger like attacking a goverment employee just a question ?
[12:29:31] BANGALISCH: @Switchblade142 He ram towards him, but did he swing?
[12:29:31] poltergeistjedi: ohio Classic
[12:29:32] ToyLetTreat: u left 2 knives on him.

[12:29:39] physica_: LUL
[12:29:43] DannyWasNotTaken: o7 no case law unfortunately
[12:29:43] Switchblade142: Although the officer does have to articulate that they were armed and dangerous or something like that
[12:29:45] genesissukehiro: yep
[12:29:45] supertramp0331: k thanks
[12:29:46] ltl_wackman: he didnt use them in the felony, yea

[12:29:52] Welshstig: not a weapon, just happy too see the cornman
[12:29:53] Sadisticmedic: Chat use google for Terry vs Ohio
[12:29:54] Kevz95: good policing esfand mhm
[12:29:54] Zeronogo: knives arent illegal
[12:29:54] vibezz_420: they werent used in the crime
[12:29:56] vitilink: you did well
[12:29:58] vmjama: @esfandtv what would you have done if Yeager said that he didn’t attack Ramee?
[12:29:59] debacle_of_our_mullets: @EnochBlanche It is a demon
[12:29:59] ToyLetTreat: could u of tested them for dna tho?
[12:30:02] cheesymarine12: They have to reasonably be suspected to be armed and involved in a crime
[12:30:05] LibusGrace: Is it Jager or Yeager?
[12:30:06] ooCORSAIRoo: self defense
[12:30:07] chivvyy: atpCap
[12:30:09] 13nox__: yup u did perfect
[12:30:09] cyb3rpan1c: sent 2 prison with knifes?
[12:30:09] magnets_: you speedran that so well @EsfandTV
[12:30:10] MisteryOshiro: Also wouldn't they be seized anyway when he got sent up?
[12:30:10] BoogieAnimal: Could you have seized them if you wanted to?
[12:30:13] Smiddler: @EnochBlanche dosnt stream afaik
[12:30:14] dains84: funny i was asking about that, and having him cuffed/detained so you can accurately take the statement.  good thing the chat called me a braindead idiot.  i learned my place  :(
[12:30:14] Crazziee_R_I_P: he’d already dumped his stuff
[12:30:15] tys0nnnnn: @LibusGrace, yeager
[12:30:15] DayStreaminDavey: why would you let someone have weapons in prison?
[12:30:15] Switchblade142: @BANGALISCH It doesnt matter lol Yaeger told Cornwood he came down there to try to kill Ramee, its an admission of guilt already
[12:30:16] Freddiepines: need to pat you down NODDERS
[12:30:16] JayIngemar: @LibusGrace Yaeger
[12:30:16] arcticOP: @LibusGrace neither, Yaeger
[12:30:16] genesissukehiro: correct i would have sezeied all of it and gave it back later lol
[12:30:17] Ahpotatoh: yes you have the strict legal precident to 'stop and frisk" but this is not irl this is rp and would the best thing be catching ramee rn?
[12:30:17] DevilDogTash: don’t think he carry’s a gun anyway
[12:30:17] DudeInARobe: he can go to jail with the knives? he bout to be the king pen dudein3HAHA
[12:30:20] dreggy69: @BANGALISCH ramee said yeager swung first, and yeager never denied it. gg
[12:30:21] Kevz95: @vmjama frisk and search ramee 100%
[12:30:25] playswitsquirrel: still need RS tho
[12:30:26] magnets_: yaeger is the best person to speed run a process like that cos he always says guilty lmfao
[12:30:27] party_buffalo_: sooooooooooooooooooo
[12:30:27] Thanks_ForTheStars: @JayIngemar jagex
[12:30:31] DezalbM: and only the weapon
[12:30:33] party_buffalo_: ooooooo
[12:30:33] Lonestar_64: frisk means you are allowed to feel the outside of his clothing not go through his / her pockets
[12:30:35] inducedcatharsis: Should you have searched Ramee?
[12:30:36] vibezz_420: But is it if you dont feel safe
[12:30:38] DrWetbone: how can you use case law from real life in a fantasy world where you are building society from ground up?
[12:30:39] SeaOfEmpty: Self defense is an affirmative defense, a crime still happened, police still arrest defenders all the time. It shakes out in court. Depends on the state though
[12:30:40] danny_yel: people would never comply with cops if all cops did that
[12:30:40] HistoriesPiston: Is this playlist available on Spotify? @EsfandTV
[12:30:41] Xen_Crypt: but what did Ramee want to meet about?
[12:30:42] FearlessOni: ensure officer and public safety
[12:30:42] kleytonbruck_br: What if Yeager didn't admit doing it?
[12:30:43] genesissukehiro: @EsfandTV  sould have seized allof and return later yep
[12:30:45] mad0monk: I just want to know when you got that bike?
[12:30:46] bobbybedstains: i mean they both been having beef its on paper
[12:30:46] LibusGrace: @arcticop thank Oh
[12:30:51] Spliphos1199: What if he had a pd gun if you frisked em
[12:30:51] Liam121abc: do they have mini tasers in this game.
[12:30:52] Welshstig: so the rp uses actual us law?
[12:30:53] EPiQ: @Lonestar_64 correct...and if you feel the bulge THEN you are allowed to search pockets
[12:30:54] epicwargasm: it was funny as hell when u searched k after he got out prison
[12:30:54] Strangemitts: is this far cry 5 soundtrack?
[12:30:55] party_buffalo_: and
[12:30:56] poltergeistjedi: fourth amendment vs ohio
[12:30:56] nimbleop: so ramee being in the altercation.. you can legally search ramee.
[12:30:58] melonvee: exactly cus yaeger admitted right away
[12:30:59] tys0nnnnn: ability to do so does not mean you should
[12:31:00] party_buffalo_: anda
[12:31:01] 13nox__: he would have frisked ramee, if the other guy didnt immediately admit that he was there to attack ramee
[12:31:02] Kevz95: @mad0monk its kits bike that was given to her by ray
[12:31:02] PsychoJoker: Jaeger literally said he was gonna kill Ramee what more do yall want LUL
[12:31:03] ZachFromChat: It was also just clear SBS LUL
[12:31:04] ViciousRumor: I think it'd be hilarious if LSPD started citing Warren v. District of Columbia
[12:31:05] Mouso9: Ramen was clean. Just like how you cleaned out before going to the park.  Staged
[12:31:08] BoogieAnimal: but you could frisk ramee right?
[12:31:08] bertacharm: selectively
[12:31:08] Imnotkarthik: other cops would have definitely searched him
[12:31:10] DezalbM: if you did that he had weed on himbut at that point you can only reach for the weapon
[12:31:11] ElizabethAtDawn: so is it officer discretion?
[12:31:12] genesissukehiro: for the most part lol
[12:31:13] hollowrust: do regular cops who arrest perps with other deadly weapons other than the one they used min commission of a crime typically let their perps continue to carry these deadly weapons?
[12:31:13] tys0nnnnn: ability to do so does not mean you should 󠀀
[12:31:14] genesissukehiro: yes
[12:31:14] leinad47: :0 Approve
[12:31:14] 0rder613: But what if they envoke the 5th before the statement
[12:31:14] drew_brooks35: you going to shift meeting ??
[12:31:15] PokeMom019: I wanna see  you  interact with a cop irl, imagine the conversation 🇺🇲 esfandCOPS LUL
[12:31:16] Welshstig: that’s kinda interesting
[12:31:17] Khaosshinobi: they intentionally left a lot of the laws out so that it creates rp
[12:31:17] itisacar: chat bein weird
[12:31:18] Recon_XoX: You did have him legally detained while investigating a violent crime
[12:31:18] Sylist13: To those sayin what if he had a pd gun, how dumb would you be to bring a pd gun after calling a cop to meet up? lmao
[12:31:18] DannyWasNotTaken: OMEGALAUGHING Wont get viggy hoppers since he doesnt stream\
[12:31:19] DannyL3tscher: a lil changed for the sake of RP though LUL
[12:31:20] JayIngemar: Very selectively I feel like LULW
[12:31:21] risingmafia_: He could have if he wanted to
[12:31:21] ltl_wackman: yea pretty much, the handbook quotes "terry v ohio"
[12:31:21] EPiQ: legally frisk
[12:31:21] DiscretionaI: Clearly a setup to RP check police work
[12:31:22] genesissukehiro: frisk not search
[12:31:23] DREEMLAN: they try to match real law
[12:31:24] thehollowaytape: do you think they were trying to distract from something else happen?
[12:31:27] mitchgroulx1234: 2 cops maybe 3 cops
[12:31:27] Ahpotatoh: i wonder how nopixel will deal with roe V wade
[12:31:28] wildbur91: lol
[12:31:29] Switchblade142: officer also has to articulate that the person has a reasonable belief that they're armed and dangerous too, no real reason to search ramee given the situation
[12:31:30] PureJuan: why is jaywalking illegal when it's legal in California Nerdge?
[12:31:31] rhino608: Ruth 100% would have
[12:31:34] iwannanuhh: dont want to *
[12:31:34] micknaster: chat when a cop doesn't do something he technically has the right to do but would piss everybody off NOWAYING
[12:31:34] Brisk_Avocado: if you didnt have the context you would have tho
[12:31:34] LudsterL: he could’ve but ramee was the victim in this case
[12:31:35] RnG_Qwik: Dont need to but legally are allowed to yes
[12:31:35] imfukinlost: officers discretion
[12:31:38] Freddiepines: not search, per se; it's a pat down
[12:31:38] genesissukehiro: frisk and search are not the same thing btw
[12:31:42] Kevz95: yeager admitted to everything. there's no need to search ramee
[12:31:42] bobbybedstains: true but thats why this happend lol mr K yesterday
[12:31:43] VincentsDeath: yaeger admitted right away too
[12:31:43] afill99: and both of them confirmed that story
[12:31:44] SurelyBaked: the confession made there be no need to search either
[12:31:44] Mhurocy: Ramee acted in self defense, and Yaeger confirmed he was the agressor
[12:31:45] chivvyy: not sure it's self defence if he called you planning to do it atpCap
[12:31:45] party_buffalo_: im shooting chat into space
[12:31:45] EPiQ: @PureJuan This is San Andreas...not CA
[12:31:46] TTLcute: @Lonestar_64 they RP it as just taking the weapons and not looking/knowing what else is there from what I have seen
[12:31:47] DannyL3tscher: @DannyWasNotTaken viggy hopper here, I'm mad :)
[12:31:47] jay_r4: yeager also admitted to it instantly
[12:31:48] TakeAChance: @esfandtv why do yall let ramee get away with so much lol
[12:31:49] 13nox__: yup
[12:31:50] playswitsquirrel: he wanted you to film it LUL
[12:31:51] qHaydos: what abt yesterday when ruth watched x get bonked and x got cuffed and searched OMEGALAUGHING
[12:31:51] chirsg: @Ahpotatoh No pregeancy.
[12:31:52] BoogieAnimal: @genesissanosuke Ya there is a difference with frisking and searching
[12:31:52] kkulf_kkulf: NODDERS peeTime CaughtLooking Looking
[12:31:54] TraviiiOnTwitch: more importantly yaeger admitted it. if he didnt you shouldve searched
[12:31:54] mandera22: Ramnee is a criminal not a lawyer, needs to be put in check for the sake of the PD or the PD needs their own lawyer
[12:31:55] puppietreats: @pokemom019 officer andrew’s is a cop in real life and he’s always giving cornwood shit lol xD
[12:31:56] tys0nnnnn: micknaster OMEGALUL
[12:31:57] nationas: its not self defense he went into the situation to make it happen to you directly on the phone @EsfandTV
[12:31:57] PsychoJoker: @Mhurocy exactly
[12:31:59] DannyWasNotTaken: @DannyL3tscher ReallyMad DANNY IS MY NAME
[12:32:00] franky47: the important part is yaegar admitting it
[12:32:00] DREEMLAN: @micknaster lmfao yeah idk why it’s hard to understand
[12:32:01] sabinstha1: This is rp. Why so serious. If ramee didn't call him, none would know. Let it be
[12:32:02] DrWetbone: if jaeger lied and said he was attacked you would’ve arrested ramee?
[12:32:02] bertacharm: cornwood has no reason to feel unsafe around ramee yet either
[12:32:03] bobbybedstains: hes being legal
[12:32:05] DezalbM: because he's good at getting away with it
[12:32:05] LeBryantJordan: it's the law KKona
[12:32:05] Shmorp: he became the aggresor tho? no?
[12:32:06] knightronical: they are RPing city PD, not CIA operatives.
[12:32:06] 0nre: @EsfandTV I was watching Nekoda earlier and he said that everyone on scene of a deadly weapon is to be frisked 4Shrug
[12:32:07] vitilink: Chat stop being weird he is right
[12:32:07] JPhilly1205: you have to have suspicion that person has a weapon and detaining somebody for questioning does not meet that
[12:32:09] Alkemiee: lol
[12:32:09] Honorspren: why is chat so weird about ramee lol
[12:32:10] Wyczolek: @PsychoJoker exacly

[12:42:19] morgado_4: why was there no captains online today did something happen?
[12:42:22] Drackaine: The difference between a frisk and a search is that the purpose of a frisk is limited to finding weapons hidden on the suspect to ensure the personal safety of police officers, its scope is limited to weapons and not for the discovery of other evidence; a search generally requires a search warrant, and its purpose is mainly to find evidence of illegal criminal activity.

[12:44:01] JasonMunday: you forgot to De-Bulge Ramee
[12:44:02] Switchblade142: was literally like 5 bags of weed not even felony amount i dont think

[12:44:12] VivaLaValle: he DID however call Yaeger to make him come there and fight.
[12:44:14] ToyLetTreat: wait so ooc did ramee steal yeagers crowbar?
[12:44:15] judge_hat: mutual combat is only legal inside city hall?
[12:44:18] dains84: he didn't have a gun, but you didn't "Cuff" detain... and he was allowed to run around and drop items.  so its just a wierd situation.  asking for protocol reasons is all
[12:44:20] Wyczolek: @nickbane20 that was yeager crew weed and he would snitch
[12:44:20] Shmoopee: Cornwood and Ramee have known eachother for years.
[12:44:21] MisterBrojangles: Cornwood had no reason to search him. Just because WE, US CHAT, know what the OOC/Meta is doesnt mean Cornwood know that.

[12:44:27] Le_Mon_Key: Nerdge why didn't you do everything in your power to fuck over ramee mr strimmer
[12:44:27] RobialT: Was Ramee just trying to get Yeagers DNA on file?
[12:44:27] skeletonmike: he threw weed in the river while the lady cop was questioning him it was fucking hilarious
[12:44:27] leemuh_: making me yawn

[12:44:29] nimbleop: But cornwood doesn't wanna charge ramee for anything.

[13:24:52] Seachicken_nc_71: LIES! LUL
[13:24:52] Grimzzly3D: i wish i could get on this server, i would no life tf out of this
[13:24:58] SammytheQueen: The crims getting cars that can outrun pd, stealing pds gun, pds not keeping up with the pace of the server
[13:25:00] Switchblade142: Yep,  thats why you end up with situations where certain people arent frisked/cuffed. Just not enough manpower to do it unfortunately
[13:25:06] jdotno: I understand what they(high command) are trying to do with PD, but I believe they underestimated what they would need for the pd to be successful, or they have a different definition of success than what most people do. Which isnt necessary bad, but it is frustrating from an outsiders point of view.

[13:26:06] budlandia: he was a bit of a kiss ass but it seemed like they just didnt like him

[13:27:05] Dricera: @Strangemitts When he was last on he said he's training FTOs irl

[13:37:24] Ahpotatoh: @SmokeSomethin i think the judges rn are reactionary to OOC rules and standards put in place
[13:37:27] ip33fr331y: Better to address important things like this after some sleep

[13:38:32] SmokeSomethin: na i can tell by the way this guy is talking that he ego trips very fast
[13:38:38] ShyMuffin: erm not very diplomatic. I think a little bit of politics goes a long way when dealing with higher ups. even more so when they are not prone to listening
[13:38:47] Lonestar_64: cornwood is staging a walkout?

[13:39:21] MaNSoN6649: Cornwood would make a fine chief one day

[13:39:26] ZilzGaming: cornwood for union rep! 󠀀
[13:39:26] Ahpotatoh: there is a real possibility here that OOC the captain's want to start a PD union. This is the only way to a PD union

[13:39:32] The805King: isnt that the opposite of what slacks said he wants
[13:39:38] GlitchyGunZ: @my69thaccount slacks would be a better senior officer over captain. He doesn’t have the life experience with people under him to properly lead. love his character though. Just an observation
[13:39:40] Mrxsardonicus: Time to unionize
[13:39:40] hennessywalton9: Tell him about ramee being a lawyer
[13:39:46] cqmer0n_193: @The805King ofc he doesn't
[13:39:47] keleviii: definitely would be hard to get him into the snowflake liberal PD sodaNODDERS
[13:39:49] dreggy69: the social pressure to not admit mistakes is crazy man
[13:39:51] gobbagooey: @BigBellyBeard Why would he not get hired, he was a great officer
[13:39:51] DREEMLAN: surprised they didn’t dap byson during interview
[13:39:52] Toastbane: Is he the judge that Cornwood gave a jaywalking citation?

[13:42:21] LogicWeasel: and they spent like a week training Parmesan instead of getting this guy on board Buhh
[13:42:23] Jimmy_Tha_Quad: Bruh it's been a month

[13:43:26] Pl4netexpress: 3 people doing 12 peoples jobs… sounds like my job in healthcare
[13:43:28] SmokeSomethin: @SarahwantsaCookie the problem with cornwood though is that he too nice to other cops and has a hard time disciplining them or calling them out on their bullshit.
[13:43:30] cyb3rpan1c: @BigBellyBeard usaul circle jerk

[13:48:33] fonic72: PD needs needs to have an intervention with all the Captains to have everyone air out the issues. Clearly the captains aren't hearing the issues in 1on1's. If they hear everyone agree in unison in a big meeting, maybe the issues will finally get to them.
