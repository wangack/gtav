[1:38:43] illifis: And if someone comes in and needs only 10% across you just tell them they should come back later... or you charge extra to fix it.

[1:49:37] shpuddie: nodd
[1:49:40] Morningstarter: atm's are basicley a loanpayback on the invested money
[1:49:43] Sacher: is it for all or was there a cap?
[1:49:48] prodiac: normally, a business would have to approve someone putting an ATM in there, to collect fees from
[1:49:48] illifis: It kinda double dips too. Gets the employees and the customers
[1:49:49] dragonesk22: Getting taxed by Lester makes even more less sense
[1:49:58] Isen_Mage: you'd need a way to charge to a business wirelessly to bypass it without having to leave the shop
[1:49:58] Matrix8369: It should not be a % of the total withdrawn, it should be like 2.50 per transaction.
[1:50:00] Kascade418: Its double tax for moselies transactions right? 5% for each part, 5% for each repair
[1:50:04] macrotoad: nodd need more "bank transfer options to banks" like a google pay option for buisiness
[1:50:04] luckerooni: there's such a thing as 5% or more ATMs but they generally exist inside businesses like casinos, most are a small single charge or 2-3% at most
[1:50:12] MJ77seven: o7 hes dead
[1:50:14] Goldflux: mojjcheck marty
[1:50:15] prozorftw: WHERE
[1:50:21] Soov: should def be a fixed fee not a % fee
[1:50:23] Syncrostrike: More like 10% if the mechanics pay for parts then the customers pay for them again
[1:50:24] PsychoBKilla: Marty is fuckin dead o7
[1:50:28] Swarles_: i don't think atm fees make sense ever
[1:50:31] rmcgowan: Yeah, the shop being a cash only business never made sense to me
[1:50:43] itz_IMAN: did they say they have to put their own in the atm?
[1:50:56] Soov: time to get an ATM like that for moseleys
[1:50:57] luckerooni: they make sense in the world where people in the city have to pay money out of their own pocket to fill them up
[1:50:57] Sonaro8: being from the uk atm fees are next to non existant
[1:51:01] mikec_218: do they have ATM fees in America?
[1:51:01] Swarles_: yeah ok, hahah i agree with that
[1:51:01] FriskiestSpoon: yeah the business would normally pay the fee or charge the customer the fee, not have some other person do it
[1:51:09] Sourblunts: And they have nothing to do with the business
[1:51:09] Boltaction_Babe: atm can also be privately owned as well
[1:51:09] TropicalToucan: I assume when you get a business account you can charge people like 3.0
[1:51:11] CptApples: they exist irl how don't they make sense
[1:51:16] Morningstarter: if you take money from an atm which is owned by another company they get charged a fee
[1:51:18] shpuddie: nodd most banks and atms have a service fee and might waive them for only their account holders
[1:51:19] BeRyce913: who tf uses atms now a days
[1:51:20] Trawls421: think of an ATM as a individual business
[1:51:20] tami_ins: It makes sense but not 5%
[1:51:21] internalin: my bank refunds all ATM fees
[1:51:23] Boltaction_Babe: YEP
[1:51:23] HotCocoaGamer: I mean you can actually buy an ATM in america lol
[1:51:23] Harcini: my ATM charges me 1.5%, 5% is too much
[1:51:29] Machatie: Probably not for EU peeps
[1:51:29] Isen_Mage: YEP
[1:51:31] zippybln2: Awkward you also have them in the EU if you withdraw money from a different bank
[1:51:35] candorus: Down with capitalism hasRaid
[1:51:35] Fr0stwav3: nodd an atm near me suddenly had a service charge on it and the businesses nearby had the bank remove it because it was losing them customers
[1:51:35] Swarles_: don't get them in the UK EZ
[1:51:37] Plausibledeniability0: Depends where your from
[1:51:42] dragonesk22: Beacause it exist in America it doesnt mean it makes sense lmao
[1:51:43] FriskiestSpoon: ATM and card processing fees
[1:51:45] Hudyn: 25% in vegas clubs lol
[1:51:45] WickedxAlex: its a thing in Canada too tho if its the same bank that u use it isnt (pretty sure)
[1:51:47] AetherMana: I learned my lesson to carry a bit of cash when i got hit with 10% withdraw fee
[1:51:48] Myki_Cameda: Most ATMs dont charge a fee if you belong to the network that runs them. if I belong to Bank A and use bank A machine, no fee, if i use Bank B machine i pay 3$ fee
[1:51:49] walnutcast: nah usually it's just like $10 for an ATM fee not percentage based
[1:51:52] bwehn: ATMs in like every convenience store charge like 10%
[1:51:52] Stanbroek: KEKW
[1:51:54] Sahneee: dentt
[1:51:54] luckerooni: what makes no sense is how chaotic it is who owns which atm and which amount they charge it was just randomly first come first serve with no regulation

[1:51:55] PsychoBKilla: KEKW

[2:39:51] Myki_Cameda: 55k car, does the upgades effect 'car value' in that calculation?
[2:40:02] Sahneee: notee
[2:40:07] L4zyb4ssturd: 0%
[2:40:07] arcticOP: How much does a non-master get on it like 5%?
[2:40:08] zippybln2: maryMath
[2:40:09] aluckynewb: at least a liver
[2:40:17] Symbiontey: ^
[2:40:18] ThePitfallover: surely it caps at 1% = 1 part KEKW
[2:40:26] Jacobian1979: i'd imagine there was a hard limit to how low a repair can go
[2:40:35] mugcostanza: shdiHmm
[2:40:37] Sufficate: almost cheaper to buy anew car
[2:40:38] BVNISH: just buy a new car NODDERS
[2:40:43] shpuddie: imagine theres a 1-2 percent min nodd
[2:40:47] ThePitfallover: 5% would be reasonable per part

[2:41:00] Matrix8369: it wont be a daily driver

[2:42:19] f4p__l0rd: It feel faster too
[2:42:31] L4zyb4ssturd: maybe it actually uses the full 100%, unlike 3.0 when 70 was fucked
[2:42:31] csmithy: yea might jsut not be as bad as in 3.0
[2:42:39] eborcurean: most people don't analyse cars like you
[2:42:39] tigerland06: 70% used to be undrivable, maybe its a lower percentage now.
[2:42:41] Soov: probably don't notice because its gradually going down as they use as well
[2:42:45] glauzmly: I could tell it looked better just by looking

[2:43:15] L4zyb4ssturd: espically non performance cars like work vehicles
[2:43:20] Matrix8369: the frog being boiled slowly
[2:43:20] Dankomanda: And most work vehicles are bulky and slow, probably harder to notice

[4:29:02] dume5330: mary's old house since she is the PM obviously
[4:29:02] Vatinius: Legion square, his fav track nodd
[4:29:06] rmcgowan: I think of it this way. People normally explore the world for a variety of reasons and the NPCs are discovered naturally. Just need people to tell other people when they find them for word to spread
[4:29:07] macrotoad: modCheck Race guy?
[4:29:12] Isen_Mage: racing clubs kyliebSlep
[4:29:16] ibruticus: This spot would be cool af for it

[4:29:46] mugcostanza: kyliebList
[4:29:50] mugcostanza: ye
[4:29:51] eborcurean: mechanics support rp
[4:29:52] PsychoBKilla: mechanics enhance the rp
[4:29:53] moe_uwu: I also agree. PC's seem to be really pushed for things so it being something on the PC makes most sense
[4:29:55] ben0809: i mean yea
[4:29:55] prozorftw: nodd
[4:30:02] ThePitfallover: mechanics should be there to SUPPORT RP
[4:30:03] mugcostanza: a good mix of both makes it good
[4:30:04] Archangelos1: Mechanics support and makes the rp better
[4:30:10] PsychoBKilla: nodd
[4:30:14] Symbiontey: nodd
[4:30:15] IFoundMyPogs: mechanics give people things to do while you're rping. i don't get the idea that it's bad or less rp
[4:30:15] ThePitfallover: you shouldn't lean 100% on mechanics to carry your content
[4:30:18] Fr0stwav3: you need the right mechanics to use as a prop/tool to enhance your RP nodd
[4:30:20] Rex__84: Mechanics should complement roleplay
[4:30:26] ImSkoldren: nodd
[4:30:27] ch4mm_: a good rper with good mechanics is magic
[4:30:35] macrotoad: need a mechanical reason for other people in engage with the RP
[4:30:41] Nighseven: awaree  no need to use no mechanics to sell used cars, just do it again Kappa
[4:30:42] Isen_Mage: even pen and paper RP games have rules and guidelines on how to do stuff etc
[4:30:48] Archangelos1: The no mechanics rp doesnt work after a while.
[4:30:48] moe_uwu: People bought in back then because there wasn't any other thing
[4:30:49] TheWhiteWillow94: nodd
[4:30:51] ben0809: nodd
[4:31:02] eborcurean: there weren't a lot in that brief classic/2.0 repeat, but luckily people bought into your rp
[4:31:04] mugcostanza: adding rp to the mechanics is what makes the immersion really nice
[4:31:05] rmcgowan: Mechanics are tools that lend immersion to the storytelling, and oftentimes good mechanics can be the sort of thing that informs and expands the kinds of stories you want to tell
[4:31:06] AkuShin_: mechanics can be use as guardrails
[4:31:07] ThePitfallover: maybe the used car sales guy is out there somewhere awaree
[4:31:14] KewlKittyProductions: Mechanics Enhance the RP they don't create it
[4:31:21] gopaintthesky: KEKW
[4:31:30] SpectreUK: Mechanic's can be used for slave labour Kappa
[4:31:31] Fr0stwav3: nodd yup, sometimes you need a mechanic to help silence a cringelord that won't buy into the rp
[4:31:36] Trawls421: is the dirt track still out there
[4:31:40] SpectreUK: oh different mechanic...
[4:31:41] Rex__84: At the end of the day it's still a video game and you as the RPer need to be engaged in it'
[4:31:42] Nighseven: Mechanics create a low base line for stuff, allowing people to build on top
[4:31:48] PsychoBKilla: WHERE
[4:31:52] ben0809: WHERE
[4:31:53] moe_uwu: The way they are going atm seems to me like. NPC's are for entry level shit. And the PC you get to build up into more things
[4:31:59] ThePitfallover: at this point though, I'd assume they'd be able to fix car transfers. It's gotta be tied to a future business or otherwise locked down
[4:32:00] Myki_Cameda: Free form Roleplay doesnt work if the people you are RPing with wont acknowledge the scene. some people need props
[4:32:17] Archangelos1: There are limitations in RP that only with mechanics you can extend the rp and brake the limitation.
[4:32:31] PsychoBKilla: tink
[4:32:31] Nars_Hood: n
[4:32:36] Symbiontey: Several ways out are scuffed

[6:06:31] NotToTheFace: Hmm
[6:06:40] Shadowyc: crafting Trey needs burger delivery money.
[6:06:57] Isen_Mage: charge a consistent part price, then a fixed cost per % repaired like $40 a %. It scales no matter the class or how many parts a car needs etc
[6:07:19] PatrickMaybe: awaree
[6:07:27] Syncrostrike: It feels like EMS/PD need a higher base price and a cheap body engine deal to encourage touch ups without all of the expensive electronics
[6:07:32] rmcgowan: It's a tough problem to solve for

[6:19:10] Myki_Cameda: Cost to customer needs to go up. Should be closer to the Rusty price, not too close, but closer than it is. 100$ was good.
[6:19:18] Heith_Au: What about a labour fee of x per set  (plus parts)
[6:19:26] Fr0stwav3: a 1 across takes the same amount of parts and time as a 2 across, so should just charge the same for both nodd
[6:19:28] poppins1729: it’s a good idea, up the 1st 10% charge to make it work then settle to the 80/50 plan
[6:19:41] apatetic: early bird special
[6:20:04] Myki_Cameda: * at the time, but with people making crazy money now it could go up
