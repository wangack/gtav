[3:15:33] mjtorn: @ichigolo yea it was bad bad. especially from some people who I doubt the boys have ever even met before
[3:15:36] ehzeegee: PD blew up 10 people, and Dundee is taking the fall for it PepeLaugh classic
[3:15:42] GoAskAlice91: lmao
[3:15:42] ExessiveGK: @Macstabber AND
[3:15:46] cravi: Consigliere vinny needs to stand on biness
[3:15:52] arch_dawg: all of this is a consequence of the server launching with far too limited governance and institutional order. it was rushed out.
[3:15:55] BadK: lmfao
[3:16:00] kiosumi: yaeger also tweeted a picture of himself next to richards dead body after he killed richard and cops said it wasn’t enough proof
[3:16:02] Macstabber: I understand that but he said he didn’t do anything
[3:16:05] Kurtna: that was a local?
[3:16:10] stayhigh718: after the warrant on K I don’t know what to expect from PD anymore. time to just watch and see I guess
[3:16:11] tread____: I actually think I you talk to cornwood he would do something
[3:16:28] kinky_kangarooo: it was a cop that blew it up firing at dundee
[3:16:34] Macstabber: CG getting screwed all around
[3:16:37] lynch1010_: and who shot the tanker
[3:16:39] azhobbit_: Why don't you snitch too?
[3:16:41] mikecollin12: Then the cops shot the ta ker and blame him 🙄
[3:16:44] mjtorn: @tread____ corn wood can’t do anything. he got daps just for talking to Mr K
[3:16:54] gamertrap: the pd don't respect the civ arc at all. once a CG crim always a CG crim in there eyes

[3:17:35] MrSlyth: @DishDawg thats because he stole a pd gun at MRPD at the front door
[3:17:36] mjtorn: @gamertrap exactly…. then they complain the server is cop vs crims, and cg crims shit all over them.
[3:17:43] arch_dawg: @gamertrap it’s not just CG, everyone is basically just a closet crim to a chunk of PD
[3:17:45] mystic_mic: Vinny is screwed
[3:17:47] mikecollin12: @dishdawg let's not talk about bans here
[3:17:51] DishDawg: @mrslyth yep
[3:17:51] PwnUWithEz: This is starting to turn in 3.0 faster than I thought. Cop bias killed the vibe then and its already starting to do so in 4.0

[3:18:46] Cressiduhhhhh: that phone washed up on the shores of africa
[3:18:50] stayhigh718: it’s just sad I had hope nopixel cops would be good in 4.0 because a lot of 3.0 cops went to ONX
[3:19:04] mafones: I watched the council meeting last week it was very telling
[3:19:05] mikecollin12: @mrslyth we don't talk about bans in chat
[3:19:25] IamthaKingslayer: i mean if mary is holding his phone when you take her hand he may get it back haha

[3:36:15] SgtHeadbuster: We all knew that this was gonna happen tbf
[3:36:18] Gamenji: could file a complaint
[3:36:20] auldae: So many have so much riding on a video game, clearly goes beyond rp for some

[3:38:20] xbryceisthename: k also feels the same about his real estate and being call scummy
[3:38:20] bigren916: If it was cg, they would of triangulated cell phones and towers
[3:38:23] teddybear7012: Is cornwood around
[3:38:24] xbryceisthename: like its pretty fucked
[3:38:24] SgtHeadbuster: Unleashing the vinny dragon now lol?
[3:38:28] MrSlyth: @Nzlaten you are a informant at that point
[3:38:28] mikecollin12: By far worst I have ever seen, there is no laws and crazy profiling with "minds wiped"
[3:38:29] stayhigh718: it really is sad tho
[3:38:30] arch_dawg: the laws are so limited, PD undermanned with divided leadership, and institutions are beyond basic. server launched as a beta that is now an anchor on RP
[3:38:31] miahsix: K getting profiled of who is was not who he is as well
[3:38:34] yogibv2: every cop claims mary is the victim while K was gunned down
[3:38:34] tread____: It's the same thing with section k
[3:38:35] Jsurvivor_nyc: shotzFeels sucks man
[3:38:37] ItsLowk: Just When I Thought I Was Out, They Pull Me Back In!

[3:38:42] JustImpulse: until the other day CG records are near spotless?
[3:38:44] killogic916: @Shotz Do you actually feel ooc that the cops thinking this has anything to do with business license?
[3:38:46] iyarpi: Should have kept mosley's out of it like you told mary you would
[3:38:48] tread____: Nino already had the meeting

[3:39:18] Drackle: all of you have worked so hard to be clean and build these businesses. and they still just treat you guys like the bad guys
[3:39:18] c2day2: Look Shotz don’t let it get you down this RP has been some of the best to watch ever. it has been great even if it doesn’t go your way just remember what you have helped build and the journey

[3:39:34] ExessiveGK: Vinny need to go to the mayor open session
[3:39:35] Nagini_Rowle_: I just make a admin report cops treating yall like it's 3.0 or ooc info
[3:39:36] Ichigolo: they already called k business scams
[3:39:37] KumasCave: it’s like clean records don’t even matter

[3:39:57] Jsurvivor_nyc: fricki5CRI
[3:39:58] kiosumi: no matter what cg does they are still treated the same doesn’t even matter it is so frustrating i hate it so much
[3:39:58] yogibv2: surely mosleys wouldn’t get a business license if they’re using that logic
[3:40:00] iyarpi: @smcclain yeager hasnt touched popular at all LOL
[3:40:01] draconianpr: how do they know it's k and ramee when they haven't been caught. just dundee
[3:40:02] lalaLissy96: why isn’t he d captains a voted position too
[3:40:02] SeanDKnight: CG needs to initiate a media and social media blitz to turn the city against Mosley's, the council, and the PD.
[3:40:10] cbrooks51: @smcclain this is just too much FACTS!!!
[3:40:11] Grickshaft: they trying to push you into these narratives?

[3:40:15] Keeper24: yessssss
[3:40:23] basicnameenjoyer: CG and haters ruining story arcs, name a more legendary duo
[3:40:32] Ichigolo: cg goes back to their old days admins OOC cant do that LMAOOOO
[3:40:33] zaf_playz: You know what ramee shows on the scene they left the guys and pointed on Ramee cops saw and gave calls also guys holding 1 guy
[3:40:36] Grickshaft: actively trying to stay clean, getting framed
[3:40:39] crizzly95: i feel like a lot of cops are living in 3.0 still lol

[3:40:51] kmuff74: has Vinny been arrested with CG.  don’t think cops can say CG is officially a thing again
[3:40:52] Benzinga: Did pd even do their due diligence and see if the gun that was planted on k was the one that shot him?
[3:40:57] Yeyohhh: FINALLYYYYYYY. we need criminal Binny
[3:40:59] tristii: it might just need to be an OOC conversation at this point tbh, I feel like they’re profiling everyone based on CG “5 yrs ago” Sadge
[3:41:01] ItsAHazardLife: The whole situation is f'd

[3:41:25] Zirbelmann: Whats the problem with ramee in the first place? hes a lawyer 100% clean record no?
[3:41:28] b_goodhue: But no one cares Yeager is with mary
[3:41:30] Wiffit: Could it have something to do wit Mary also having a main cop? Not stirring but with all that has happened is the only explanation to me. All Yeager and Mary do to not even get looked at once is beyond crazy to me.
[3:41:31] Weekend_fun: pd is going to kill no pixle
[3:41:31] hehe_nah17: @JustImpulse they still are except K
[3:41:32] heartyj2: PoroSad PoroSad PoroSad

[3:41:52] superfrostyy: @kmuff74 there are no official gangs in the city yet LUL its just groups of people running around claiming shit
[3:41:53] basicnameenjoyer: Vincenzo Demon Time
[3:41:53] BrodieBlue: @Wiffit Angel is a judge. not a cop
[3:41:55] cbrooks51: Sounds like you need to talk to Cornwood
[3:41:56] Keitho86: @wiffit I was thinking the same
[3:41:57] StreamElements: Make sure you are following the stream and have notifications on to know when Shotz goes live.
[3:42:03] my_saviour: @gr1ggs_ crazy, but admin(s) are a part of the pd
[3:42:05] WaRGoDLeSs: Lol since when do police dictate what business folks can own .
[3:42:09] PinkDeathstar97: @benzinga it’s like they didn’t even want to rp it out and just arrested him Sadge
[3:42:11] Battle_Cries: Really does seem that the server wants old CG back in the mix
[3:42:23] ZoobackHD: campaign against binny
[3:42:24] suijay: they would still have to prove popular motor works is behind this
[3:42:33] Jayl0cked: the cops are only one voice on council ….
[3:42:43] notgoldcrossslayer: Facts!
[3:42:48] Jsurvivor_nyc: fricki5MAD need that cop name please and thank you
[3:42:55] Piteee: o snap
[3:42:57] mawright1982: that’s some BS
[3:42:57] Wyborn24: Certain folks don't want CG doing business RP.
[3:42:59] PwnUWithEz: Gatekeeping RP
[3:42:59] Moobs_: mayor has full discretion over business licenses
[3:43:02] appleceee: nekkoda isnt on the chamber of commerce, hes on  the council
[3:43:02] Wiffit: I get she is a judge now but she has forever been a cop. Now a judge and even more reason cops will bow to her
[3:43:02] Keeper24: nakoda is boys with k and ramee though
[3:43:02] axlues: It sad
[3:43:03] smcclain: @iyarpi  not just about hitting popular
[3:43:04] Synvius: nekoda is only one vote
[3:43:04] whack1000: speak to Nekoda about it
[3:43:05] GETAFlX: pay off the cops then!
[3:43:05] stayhigh718: @wargodless since a felony will keep you from a license PD have a big say
[3:43:10] Juannson: cg needs to start planting pd guns on people on council who do not fit the agenda
[3:43:10] patch5594: but you aren’t though? what’s the basis for that
[3:43:12] 12_31_1996: hes actually not that bad , k and ramee talked to him yesterday
[3:43:14] brute_forsen: mayor has like no power
[3:43:14] d3ltaf0x: Its table
[3:43:14] Nutty_Ballocks: it shouldn’t be like that but it is
[3:43:14] bladexrunner210: Yeah but the thing is the cops are treating this like 5 years ago when its supposed to be a fresh restart
[3:43:17] Gamenji: but ramee is still a lawayer
[3:43:17] LateNightNoods: KILLRUTH
[3:43:17] Keitho86: Lazy roleplay from the cops. Cops gate keep RP
[3:43:18] TeeTops: Can't u sue the state then?
[3:43:19] Keshmar: when cg burns the city to the ground "you get what you fucking deserve" watch them cry
[3:43:20] Jayl0cked: so you have to whip the votes of crane, the ems lady and Mallon…
[3:43:20] REAPER_Replicator: 3 people need to vote yes
[3:43:22] jers_gaming: its just sad that they cant prove or have any evidence to support such an allegation against popular and vinny
[3:43:22] retro_redesign: Pretty sure cornwood just talk out his ass, try to persuade yall from the war...
[3:43:22] Ichigolo: mayor cant do anything
[3:43:22] arch_dawg: the whole business license stranglehold coming over a month after launch is goofy BS
[3:43:23] yogibv2: max promised you first dibs just stay calm until he says something
[3:43:26] TylerDavidH: yeah the mayor is one seat out of like 6
[3:43:29] Luthercorpz: Mayor is more locked down than ever before LUL
[3:43:29] b_goodhue: Mostly goes to vote on counsel
[3:43:30] piratethepirate1231: they do vote
[3:43:30] soulbrek24: WTH is happening with PD btw?
[3:43:31] notgoldcrossslayer: Boys just need to go back to prodigy hate to say it but shit never seems to change round here
[3:43:32] gr1ggs_: @my_saviour Can't convince 20 ppl in RP that there doing a bad job, kinda at the point to where act needs to be taken outside of RP
[3:43:33] SgtHeadbuster: Mayor is a puppet
[3:43:33] c2day2: I think that was for laws
[3:43:34] Shadow42020: the mayor has to have 3 or 4 votes on his side for it to go through
[3:43:37] Nzlaten: He said business proposals are through him I'm pretty sure unless they changed it
[3:43:38] d3ltaf0x: You do have 2 votes at least
[3:43:40] Juannson: the mayor has the final vote out of 8 people I think @Shotz
[3:43:41] superfrostyy: the pd liason seems like a fiar person at least. no real biases
[3:43:41] soulbrek24: why is PD in chaos?
[3:43:45] BSG_Reaper20: Crane has been showing to have more power than max
[3:43:45] Nutty_Ballocks: mayor is just one vote
[3:43:45] axlues: Yep Mary got no control anymore Crane and the council only mayor just a face that's all it is now
[3:43:47] appleceee: Nekkoda isnt on the chamber, he's only on the council @Shotz
[3:43:48] WaRGoDLeSs: Isn't Nakota the one investigating the misconduct of the pd
[3:43:49] ExessiveGK: Mayor has descesion on business, he's forming a civ counsel thing
[3:43:51] Piteee: thats a reach
[3:43:53] tanksrp: gose to a table vote and if its a tie  vote then mayor  vote  takes  pressence and is the deciding factor
[3:43:53] piratethepirate1231: the mayor can change tax how much u make
[3:43:53] highjayare: Prodigy mayor Vinny pisson 😂😂
[3:43:53] xl_scout_lx: Nakota is the police leason so Vinny could go to him and ask questions about the reports that you and Arrowhead put about Mary and her people
[3:43:54] bladexrunner210: Yeah but the thing is the cops are treating this like 5 years ago when its supposed to be a fresh restart and it's literally crazy af bro @shotz
