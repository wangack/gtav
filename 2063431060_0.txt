[4:07:11] Luke_So_Good: Shiesty's snr buns arc omE
[4:07:11] GalaxyDoesTwich: did you watch the new deadpool trailer @Deansocool
[4:07:14] quaylewastaken: They want you to RP it out. You rob all your boy come rescue you

[4:07:48] m_1ne: Dean have you watched the sidemen Netflix doc
[4:08:02] MrPhoNoodle: imagine the PD having to save den zel after suspending him
[4:08:04] eeDrix: @lazymike yea I know he fired, is just that Johnson was makin guns with the gun license he had

[4:57:33] theed37: crims have strategies for robbing trucks
[4:57:50] LazyMike: Clayton never lost rep
[4:57:50] shifu414: its kinda ass tho bc you need all 40, so if you lose even one pallet the job a flop no payout
