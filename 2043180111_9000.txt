[4:06:42] curdi317: It's crazy because they generalize those cars vs. the model's people own
[4:06:55] goldtrendy: All the stress, money and drama is why ive out off learning how to drive for so long curvyeLUL

[4:09:46] Strescicca: whenever i buy a car i google if it has a non-interference motor or not. because if it is, if the timing belt breaks it doesnt nuke the engine
[4:10:43] Strescicca: some have chains, some have belts

[4:14:29] dinoroaria: curvyeW
[4:14:40] curdi317: I typically lease my car, so I need the highest tier of insurance too. So, having it covered with the higher cost makes it worth it
[4:15:34] goldtrendy: @thallo_auxo thats bonkers
[4:16:38] desol733: I also pay for extra insurance for injuries. If I fuck up and hurt somebody, and they go to the hospital, then that hospital bill no matter what is going to be huge
[4:16:39] Thallo_Auxo: @goldtrendy I work in accounts, but this is a small business and I have been accounts assist at a big business and there was no credit check.
