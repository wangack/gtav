[7:02:02] mgoog24: curvyeCozy i do love house flipper
[7:03:18] Ravidge: Now that you have Local space movement, I bet all the floor bits are sized in a consistent unit, so using "snap movement" would line them up
[7:03:54] Jen848: so freaking close
[7:04:14] Ravidge: it snaps to the values you see on the right
[7:04:22] Ravidge: so it increments in set amounts
[7:05:21] opmoley: can you over lap
[7:05:34] Heith_Au: to make everyone feel more at home instead of using normal bedroom doors u could use doors like in the cells have at MR PD

[7:17:20] Heith_Au: and raise the top floor will fit 3 level
[7:17:57] BrizzyPeezy: Make different layers to the house
[7:18:17] vonsoloh: took damn near 3 hours but we getting there
[7:20:58] Heith_Au: 3hrs later lol
[7:22:57] Ravidge: I strongly suggest using snap movement for floors and walls. values like 0.25 will make it so you never have weird decimals to work with in the future
[7:23:54] Ravidge: Just make sure the first piece if "on grid" with the values to the right
[7:24:31] Ravidge: The first piece you put down dictates everything, it becomes a reference
[7:25:02] crycast: Jigsaw puzzle curvyeNLT
[7:25:26] Ravidge: Set the values on the right manually to something "nice"
[7:25:40] Ravidge: THEN you can start using snap
[7:25:52] RhiaAndTheMoon: yeah the decimal points are messing with ya

[7:29:16] Heith_Au: the house is on an angle
[7:29:53] Heith_Au: put a single under the door maybe
[7:30:40] Ravidge: What you need is to have one piece, any piece become a reference point that you build outwards from. And if that piece has Nice even values, things will click into place with snapping
[7:33:42] MrSpiny: katesNoted
[7:34:10] BrizzyPeezy: You might just need to use smaller pieces
[7:35:14] MrSpiny: what if the floor boards ran the other way curvyeShy
[7:36:49] Ravidge: Because the starting value is crazy
[7:37:03] Ravidge: Make it as "nice" as possible
[7:37:25] Ravidge: like one or 2 decimals max
[7:38:47] BrunoLM: if you dont want them to change automatically, maybe set snap to 0?
[7:41:39] Renee_Lemay: How are we all doing today? Are my fellow elephants hungry?
[7:42:01] Renee_Lemay: Does anyone need a snack?

[7:54:08] BetterWithButter: yo they got a house now?
[7:55:43] Heith_Au: I think a split stair ie Daliha's idea might be good as u need space for the kitchen along that wall

[8:03:36] StreamElements: Unsteady - X Ambassadors
[8:04:09] Heith_Au: just a thought what about the smaller size squares would they fit across any better then the one large piece?
[8:05:03] Ravidge: The issue you had earlier with manually adjusting values is probably because you were in "local space" and not "world", that would cause movement in one axis to affect another
[8:05:55] Ravidge: one you're in
[8:07:24] MrSpiny: katesBongo
[8:07:27] Ravidge: y rotation too

[8:10:29] MrSpiny: surely...
[8:10:52] Heith_Au: Q
[8:15:06] RhiaAndTheMoon: is the large piece shoved against the far wall or is there a gap on that side too?
[8:18:42] xCommunity: Stairs on that wall would be nice, yeah
[8:19:55] vonsoloh: i was thinking the same thing like just one small step behind a tile or two
[8:20:49] EndersDane: KEKW
[8:20:57] Heith_Au: think u need a square piece at the front door which is the right level maybe ?
