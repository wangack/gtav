[4:03:28] brandonpotter123: Aren't they just updating the price to be reflective of an even cost around the board. I know you used to be able to sub for like .20 usd if you vpn to certain countries which would actually fuck over the streamers when ppl would gift a ton of subs at that price because they wouldnt be making the normal amount on people who would have subbed but got gifted
