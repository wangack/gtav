[1:12:49] Ginge__4: kinda forcing they’re hand by not accepting anything they say
[1:12:49] Hezi9s: @Ray__C Does Ray really not care that Yuno is friends with X, if he hates X xd
[1:12:50] Spartoriius: it doesnt
[1:12:50] dezguystoast: thinks he always right
[1:12:52] thatguyfisk: That was a valid point tbh, if they know you're going for new heists Lang could definitely crack down on materials

[1:13:15] SereneDreams: @kengines He only shares vital info one way, he'll try to weasel vital info out of people that like him but he only gives real vital info to the Lang/co. He's not really a trustworthy person because he's a neutral party that spreads info with a preference.

[3:51:59] inndur: People become emotionally invested in the story of their favorite character. Then when something happens they feel the need to lash out. They would do the same to movie and tv stars if they could when a villain or a hero does something they don't like. Most due to delusions of parasocial relationships. Society is harshest when they have animosity
