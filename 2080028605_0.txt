[1:11:24] CarentanKiller: They should be paid well but unfortunately not here

[1:13:01] benkidd: its progressing, but we tend to only see the good stuff. In the background its probably a way off yet
[1:13:01] spAnser: Think of all the robot arms assembling stuff. You think lots of people lost jobs when those got invented?
[1:13:07] ChemicalPpt: Honestly, it's gonna end up being like how it is in Wall-E, with people on chairs in VR and robots and AI manage everything
[1:13:18] RGeneral24: That has been a thing for a few years
[1:13:19] UltamaZ: People used to say the same about cars back in the day removing horse and carriage jobs, I think its inevitable people will lose jobs for progression of society

[3:52:43] symmetricalarena: PopCorn GlitchCat
[3:52:45] TheJubJubBird: Wait you can choose how many numbers in the PIN too?
[3:52:46] IceBadger: I think if it fails 3 times, then its done, and they cant attempt anymore
[3:52:46] dazzaisreal: it's cutting corners
[3:52:49] Kohtalon_: yeah that seems 100% powergamey
[3:53:01] Kroykumzz: OMEGADANCEBUTFAST
[3:53:02] IceBadger: only the original owner can unlock it after the 3 tries
[3:53:03] RGeneral24: I think you can do alphanumeric like an actual password

[3:54:05] GR_Alex: sounds a bit too far
[3:54:08] Kroykumzz: don't think DW gonna enjoy that
[3:54:10] Drummer919: If you'd want that on the server you'd make it a mechanic i assume
[3:54:16] coaxfun: there should be a find-my-phone feature NODDERS
[3:54:25] kevsnor: Yeah keep it ingame
[3:54:35] jummper__: omg i thought that guy farming was a gorilla OMEGADANCEBUTFAST
[3:54:41] bloominghel: There would have to be a counter mechanic like being able to track the person using your phone
[3:54:47] PartTimeNinja_: YEP could just crack it forever given enough time
[3:54:47] Jdiask: ideally phones would degrade if not with the owner or something
[3:54:50] londonwalker_: what did poet say?
[3:54:52] rathan_reddy: yeah and the phones don't even break awkward
[3:54:52] Thorekh: yeah
[3:54:54] madboyfreddy: does the pin lock you out if you get it wrong a few times
[3:54:57] benb92: you’d think after a certain amount of time the stolen phone would run out of battery or something
[3:55:03] Coxswain_Stroke: neva eva NOPERS
[3:55:04] benkidd: it would be good to add being able to disable an old phone
[3:55:11] PartTimeNinja_: @madboyfreddy probably not if theres a character that brute forces them
[3:55:16] jummper__: can people change the password on your phone to lock you out?
[3:55:42] objectsflex: yup, like mike block did LUL
[3:55:45] MiskyeXD: yea Mike Block did it
[3:55:46] IceBadger: phones used to have durability so you had to get a new one from time to time
[3:55:53] londonwalker_: it can also be like find my phone where you can delete all the info from a lost phone
[3:56:12] itsTheLastVictor: ^^
