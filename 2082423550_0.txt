[4:17:11] tyrannuswrecked: Remember to assert that you were not given an opportunity to obey the lawful order
[4:17:17] fahd_g: can you look at the law of what they are charging you with?
[4:17:19] raj_r997: accessory is away
[4:17:20] Gaz_H20: get help from Siobhan?
[4:17:21] Shadowhaox: @lliasry Kitmond is over
[4:17:24] jaysonkat: No we don't have kitmond content anymore
[4:17:24] david199915: It's content anyway
[4:17:34] farmerdrowzy: you could argue that you're not an accessory due to the fact he  crime had already been committed and he was down so it was an entirely different situation
[4:17:36] Bleepinbloopin: @Gaz_H20 lawyers didn't answer
[4:17:36] FreezingIvy: You weren't even aware of what the crime was
[4:17:36] oopsieadam: its accessory, but u didn’t actually do anything sooo
[4:17:37] richdawg6045: but you didn’t aid anyone
[4:17:38] taginor: "Accomplice: a person who helps someone else to commit a crime or to do something morally wrong"
[4:17:38] StreamElements: Ray has an active Twitter that you can use to stay up to date with him! raycHypeTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheRay_C
[4:17:46] tyrannuswrecked: Intent may be irrelevant based on the letter of the law
[4:17:53] twinspike: Try "the police officer was swinging his baton so wildly, he took out his partner and took me down from 2 streets away" 😆
[4:17:53] Rhysing: accessory could be like someone that provides a car and logs off
[4:17:54] VtuberLoverAlways: you're done bud SeemsGood
[4:17:57] 420warlock: they should let you look at the actual definitions of the crimes before u go
[4:17:58] Shadowhaox: You didn’t even know what they did technically
[4:17:59] david199915: Ask rame lmao
[4:18:05] Gaz_H20: @bleepinbloopin shes not a lawyer anymore but doesn’t stop he giving advice
[4:18:05] helixpyre84: Accessory after the fact, accomplice is the guy driving the getaway car
[4:18:08] everyone1980: you should see if you can accessory obstruction of justice. it’s a lesser charge I think.
[4:18:08] StreamElements: Twitch Ads are enabled by default on this channel. They come around every 20 minutes, for about 60 seconds. There are ways to fight back against ads, such as subscribing to the channel, Twitch Turbo, among other means! Thank you for watching!
[4:18:10] bocheeky: i guess literally being at the scene of the crime makes you an accomplice? thats what theyre arhguing
[4:18:20] dee_love16: what can they even prove other than you were there at the end haha
[4:18:21] fahd_g: they can’t charge you with accessory because you didn’t move the guy
[4:18:24] ivanreq: imagine Raymond does a fake lawyer southern accent in the Russian accent LUL
[4:18:27] wolf_the_ai: accessory can be used for charging people that give aid after the crime
[4:18:29] ChaoticSanity: An accessory means providing assistance or aiding someone who has committed a criminal act without directly partaking in its commission; an accomplice actively joins their crime companion to commit it together.
[4:18:32] taginor: You actually didnt get to act or do anything when you arrived. So ur not technically guilty of anything. @Ray__C
[4:18:34] tyrannuswrecked: accessory might be the guy laundering the money
[4:18:35] 5wuu19: Sadge
[4:18:39] tyrannuswrecked: it’s tangential

[5:30:14] JellyCraven: Chat so negative smh
[5:30:14] BMoff92: @void5678 shhh
[5:30:15] FreezingIvy: You could always clarify that you did work G6 but then because you are fell in you couldn't work it anymore so you were telling the truth saying that you did work for G6 and you did work for a couple weeks but for today that was not what you were working on with
[5:30:16] ivanreq: lol I thought queenie was the cop punching Ray LUL
[5:30:18] nyjulio: Everyone tell Ray he has the right to an appeal. Tell the lawyer about this if the case goes south. <3 <3 <3
[5:30:22] yzeed_ar: Guns?
[5:30:22] DjCriSx: o7 guns
[5:30:24] intern002: i'm confused about whether or not crims are supposed to be allowed to pick up downed/cuffed criminals from a crime scene
[5:30:26] aston_ca: They can link houses with keys now chat
[5:30:27] expected24: So they raided a house that doesnt belong to any of you?
[5:30:27] xmusica_: THIS GUY KEK

[5:30:32] raj_r997: o ta ta in for weapon manufacturing if they find the BPs
[5:30:44] witness2nv: Eli = Liability
[5:30:47] gateloz: i'm pretty sure you have done g6 with Yuno even without signing in as security or am I trolling
[5:30:47] BMoff92: @johnny_killmore LUL
[5:30:49] FreezingIvy: Ik
[5:30:56] hornycoral: @witness2nv actually KEKW
[5:30:57] Bleepinbloopin: Benji probably trolling
[5:30:57] JellyCraven: @witness2nv nah hes just new and learning, everybody has to learn
[5:31:00] Lord_Machiavellian: @kilugradi That is not the problem at all. The plan was sound. The problem was people diverted from the plan or were not fully informed of it.
[5:31:00] richdawg6045: none of you guys even own the house
[5:31:06] x3_forsakener_x3: benji def trolling
[5:31:07] RayRey22: maybe the vest
[5:31:08] ibomb12: Benji isn't trolling
[5:31:10] intern002: it feels like there is a divide about what is allowed and now allowed in terms of picking up downed suspects
[5:31:13] coldkilling101: Left camero outback of house
[5:31:14] kei_flower: The home is ott home too
[5:31:15] Haven_Hunter: Don't meta the raid
[5:31:17] johnny_killmore: @BMoff92 JUDGE ALREADY MAKING HIS DECISION
[5:31:18] RaycBot: sub to the youtube https://youtube.com/raycgaming
[5:31:20] tyrannuswrecked: @Ray__C the prosecution never really asserted any criminal act, or aid rendered in support of the charge, so you should be fine. but the judge is only going to remember your counsel slinging objections and that's concerning
[5:31:21] intern002: some people harshly believe crims should not be allowed to do that
[5:31:22] DjCriSx: OTT WAKING UP IN JAIL LMAOOO
[5:31:26] witness2nv: @JellyCraven he has had enough chances to learn
[5:31:29] riftshadow: They raided OTT's house and he was not involved...
[5:31:33] Beezer74: Maple needs to get bonked he lied alot
[5:31:33] Denraoden: How is it meta to asume that beji is always trolling OMEGADANCE
[5:31:35] Lurdzz: chat he doesn’t own it but multiple officers know he stays there he literally told the cops so
[5:31:40] JellyCraven: @witness2nv thats why its called learning, its a process
[5:31:40] hortusinurbe: @DjCriSx LUL
[5:31:41] everyone1980: I’ll be surprised if you don’t get charged
[5:31:44] nyjulio: Ask for appeal Ray. lol
[5:31:51] falseff: @intern002 i dont think you know what youre talkin about LUL
[5:31:53] Gaz_H20: maybe the found the car you abandoned behind house
[5:31:53] witness2nv: @JellyCraven still a liability
[5:31:56] jewonemorrtiz: she should acted like Amber Heards lawyer and just said objection hearsay
[5:31:58] JellyCraven: @witness2nv ok
[5:31:59] EfrainG0630: they would only raid your apartment if any
[5:32:00] intern002: @falseff what do you mean?
[5:32:01] oopsieadam: doing crime honestly terrible for money in 4.0. just be civ
[5:32:02] Haven_Hunter: 4.0 cops makes me moss 3.0 cops.
[5:32:04] LucidShooter: @Beezer74 raymond lied too lol
[5:32:04] CodeForTea: 100% not true
[5:32:05] Haven_Hunter: Moss
[5:32:05] KushKowboy6: Testilying it happens IRL too
[5:32:10] itsmechelsea_: yeah ops are a bit crooked
[5:32:10] ibomb12: They need body cams
[5:32:10] Haven_Hunter: Miss**
[5:32:11] Bleepinbloopin: Sure benji
[5:32:13] soydirty: they were talking about dragon not you
[5:32:15] mrpurg3: yea basically no other witness for raymond
[5:32:18] Beezer74: Maple said the white cap was swapped and then said it wasn't involved
[5:32:22] jordeon123: From their side though they said it, you just couldnt hear it. So its not exactly lieing but i can see how its worded sounds sus ya
[5:32:24] repzeus: if they lie they get ban?
[5:32:24] rstineffect: No penzone didn't testify against Raymond
[5:32:28] helixpyre84: Only 1 of the cops did ray, the other said he was knocked out before
[5:32:34] x3_forsakener_x3: LOL
[5:32:36] Shadowhaox: no Penzone said nothing about Raymond
[5:32:37] twinspike: 2nd officer said dragon got full warning
[5:32:42] ivanreq: no one mentioned the cop beating everyone DinoDance including his partner
[5:32:42] ex_poseidon: KEKW
[5:32:43] damiandgm: the other officer also stated that he was unconscious, so he purjurd himself
[5:32:51] altluck: objections were good
[5:32:54] gateloz: you can rapid object the judge over reacted
[5:32:54] SMORKw: the judge likes objections
[5:32:54] ChaoticSanity: did I hear them say Raid?
[5:32:57] BMoff92: LUL I love Benji bro
[5:32:57] JellyCraven: Hopefully he doesnt make a decision based on being annoyed
[5:32:57] zxxuk: well that’s their job
[5:32:58] Shadowhaox: you going to Sue?
[5:32:59] SMORKw: didnt piss judge off at all
[5:32:59] Kyndir: It's unfortunate because the objs were actually good
[5:33:00] spacecowboy2417: o7 time to come home
[5:33:00] Noxro: ur not coping that its ur lawyers fault surely
[5:33:01] intern002: lawyers are supposed to do that irl, so it depends on the judge
[5:33:01] hornycoral: have u never seen a court case before this is normal
[5:33:02] wishyouhappiness: no you was ok until you said you worked for g6
[5:33:02] TriHardNerd: I don't think he was pissed about that
[5:33:04] mr_antsis: o7
[5:33:04] hortusinurbe: nah rapid objections is fine
[5:33:07] ivanreq: The cop swung like y’all were piñatas DinoDance
[5:33:08] StreamElements: Support Ray C by subscribing to his Twitch channel! This can be done for free with those who have Twitch prime. https://www.twitch.tv/products/ray__c
[5:33:09] brittbritt90d: if you didn't answer so quick might have been ok
[5:33:14] intern002: the judge already decided
[5:33:17] intern002: before the objections
[5:33:18] mrpurg3: @ivanreq yea no one even ask the cops
[5:33:18] Ninja_v1: nah its her job to not have you answer unnecessary questions
[5:33:21] slumvillager: I thought she was rapidly objecting because Raymond answered a bunch of shit hastily
[5:33:21] TriHardNerd: the airport security story was working fine until G6 happened
[5:33:23] richdawg6045: if you just listened to judge and waited before answering
[5:33:23] clayman_2: That is how coart work, objections are always done like that
[5:33:24] s_ram15: rapid objections are fine as long as they can be explained
[5:33:25] tyrannuswrecked: @Ray__C as a matter of law, the cops didn't argue anything except guilt by association and guilt based on priors. they didn't argue about the charges being deliberated in court
[5:33:26] itzmanea: you could still win the case, still little hope
[5:33:27] dragonesk22: TLDR @ray__c ?
[5:33:27] fahd_g: judge shouldn’t get pissed it’s the lawyer job now he is seeing all the evidence with no emotion
[5:33:29] alihaiy1: if you paused before saying the g6 question would have been fine
[5:33:29] Diggy_waffle: are you gonna appeal if you lose it
[5:33:30] ZekeXD: @Ninja_v1 this
[5:33:32] alihaiy1: now 50/50
[5:33:33] Haven_Hunter: The judge deciding = bathroom break KEKW
[5:33:36] Lord_Machiavellian: They probably should not have gone back for Eli. But, they can learn from this.
[5:33:40] intern002: only issue is this is not a real judge, this is just an rp judge
[5:33:45] baxsm: @Haven_Hunter HAHAHHAHAH alwayssss
[5:33:45] damiandgm: You were interupted by the defence and the prosecutors while you where answering group 6
[5:33:46] DjCriSx: imagine ott waking up to 0/4 guns Stare
[5:33:49] intern002: so how they act is unpredictable
[5:33:50] elliot5454: Maybe that is why Yuno was calling earlier.
[5:33:53] nyjulio: lol
[5:33:55] blazemarley: just got here chat, what is ray being charged with?
[5:34:00] helixpyre84: I miss murphy as a lawyer
[5:34:05] sirdinez: @DjCriSx they lost guns?
[5:34:06] Dbl__: @intern002 these aren't real cops or real criminals either
[5:34:07] davidpeck_: Exactly
[5:34:09] baxsm: @DjCriSx house heist 2.0 o7
[5:34:10] LucidShooter: @intern002 i don't see how that's an issue since the cops are RP cops and the criminal is an RP criminal lmfao
[5:34:15] Rhysing: The radio channel
[5:34:16] reshawnguides: @intern002 Yea you aint gonna find an IRL Judge on GTA LUL LUL
[5:34:18] x_juiceman: Yeah lawyer made a good objection on the radio questioning
[5:34:20] gateloz: @Lord_Machiavellian i feel like the new crim meta for saving people is killing the cops opposed to tackling them or something if they are gonna instantly bonk
[5:34:22] genium_03: PopCorn PopCorn PopCorn PopCorn
[5:34:25] davidpeck_: There no connection besides the radio
[5:34:25] Lord_Machiavellian: It's out of your hands now.
[5:34:26] alpasoup1: Probably not it sounds like he only listened to the things he wanted to hear
[5:34:28] wolf_the_ai: lawyers didnt really contest it that he wasnt there either
[5:34:32] LucidShooter: @reshawnguides tbf crane is a IRL lawyer so anything is possible
[5:34:35] JellyCraven: @LucidShooter waaaait, this is all RP?! Kappa
[5:34:36] Kyndir: Was Raymond ever even given his charges in court? xD
[5:34:37] Rhysing: It's in evidence, it doesn't get thrown out
[5:34:39] intern002: @Dbl__ they believe they're real cops, or else they would allow the crims to pick up downed/cuffed crims
[5:34:40] witness2nv: you were ther
[5:34:41] TriHardNerd: the charge should relate to picking up of the downed crim
[5:34:42] davidpeck_: It's still in evidence
[5:34:50] Shadowhaox: you never mentioned you want to sue for excessive force, do you do that after?
[5:34:51] richdawg6045: in evidence
[5:34:51] bkr6249: it was objected in your testimony not objected in officers testimony
[5:34:52] falseff: It was not removed from evidence tho
[5:34:52] JellyCraven: @intern002 you are not fr right now KEKW
[5:34:54] slumvillager: if the radio channel is dismissed, there is reasonable doubt
[5:34:55] intern002: real cops will never extend the scene like that and offer a second chance
[5:34:59] lvlagg: bruh who in their right mind would go into an active police situation to save a criminal
[5:35:00] Dbl__: @intern002 lol
[5:35:01] witness2nv: you being there is evidence
[5:35:03] dazchar: is that chatter
[5:35:03] YoWashed: Stronge nt
[5:35:06] Lord_Machiavellian: @gateloz They shouldn't have gone back for Eli. Going back for people in those kind of situations is foolish.
[5:35:07] ivanreq: Ray was beat like a piñata DinoDance Swift and vicious
[5:35:10] jeff_taxtenkey: Officer testimony had it included
[5:35:16] twinspike: How do you get a court case for 3xce
[5:35:19] intern002: i think some people forgetting this is rp and not irl
[5:35:20] raj_r997: o ta ta waking up in Jail
[5:35:23] VeteranClacky: OTT o7
[5:35:24] ultragez: cooked
[5:35:25] tyrannuswrecked: remember to call Yuno back when you're done, too
[5:35:26] gateloz: @Lord_Machiavellian yeah if you hurt someone sure. but they didn't hurt anyone.
[5:35:26] twinspike: Excessive force
[5:35:26] Lord_Machiavellian: Instead of 1 going to jail, they had five go to jail.
[5:35:33] alpasoup1: OTT back to BSK
[5:35:33] not_rahk: Bro was beating everyone on scene LULW
[5:35:34] judge_hat: who is the guy with the clown voice
[5:35:42] mrpurg3: @twinspike it this even mention?
[5:35:44] JellyCraven: @intern002 you're the only one saying its not a real judge KEKW
[5:35:45] Lycaonwtf: no need to "connect to a crime" if it is accessory(rendering material support or service to a suspected criminal) they go for
[5:35:46] Haven_Hunter: MooseKnuckles is the clown
[5:35:46] intern002: @not_rahk he got too immersed and thought he was a real cop
[5:35:48] traze02: did they do heist already?
[5:35:55] Thanskiii: there’s no way there was a raid, we all know benji fucks with everyone’s minds and plays jokes lol
[5:35:59] not_rahk: @intern002 Aware
[5:36:00] LucidShooter: @mrpurg3 doesn't matter for this case. raymond can sue for it tho
[5:36:03] egan_li: o7
[5:36:07] riftshadow: House is not an issue... they had no cause to raid the house as the owner was not involved and they have nothing linking you to it.
[5:36:10] wreckednation: Lol o7
[5:36:11] mrpurg3: @LucidShooter ok
[5:36:20] gateloz: @Lord_Machiavellian there's lvls of force, if you bonk then he should be able to shoot. magdumping for moving a body where no one was hurt is kinda weirdge
[5:36:33] Denraoden: including his cop friend and the cuffed guy
[5:36:33] Beezer74: He never warned him to back up or anything
[5:36:35] johnny_killmore: @riftshadow THEY RAISD ANYONE WITH A KEY NOW
[5:36:38] slumvillager: only person who has a strong case against excessive force is Eli
[5:36:40] coldkilling101: @riftshadow Rays camero was outback of the house.
[5:36:48] TriHardNerd: mhm

[5:48:03] gateloz: g6 and radio
[5:48:04] BealethNL: I dont understand the grounds they will take your DNA for
[5:48:04] rolo_6x3: if the white car is yours then that makes sense why they raided your house they’re looking for the money in the robbery
[5:48:06] TriHardNerd: RADIO and G6
[5:48:07] alpasoup1: If they were to ask about the radio you might have gotten away
[5:48:07] itsfacelss: what do you mean? radio means involvement and since they can’t physically prove you committed the crime its a conspiracy

[5:48:15] p__dragon: radio and g6 claim
[5:48:20] witness2nv: plant radio isn't enough you nobs. Ray was on seen interfering with criminals arrests - being the main factor
[5:48:23] Rhysing: You had no credibility
[5:48:29] JellyCraven: nah rapid objections are normal, the radio was always going to fuck you from the beginning
[5:48:30] mrpurg3: is bonking a thing now not the taser chat?

[5:48:48] RatedUnrated: The court case would've never happened if not for the -1 on the cop.
[5:48:48] void5678: No it's the radio thing it got objected that's why you aren't able to tell your alibi
