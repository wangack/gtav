[4:13:09] Splashzone69: sheriffNOTES only left turns legal
[4:13:11] Chrissy1337: you can even make cars manual jenntacles
[4:13:15] xcessive4ce: We might need to put some more muscle in the the old crown vic
[4:13:18] vbgreen: the rules seem very lax or not enforced
[4:13:24] Jordacus: Can you call it in so that the car is tagged if someone else comes across it?
[4:13:25] jenntacles: @chrissy1337 oh that’s cool
[4:13:27] TrinCroft: You can do all kinds of stuff. I asked my brother about it once. He works on one of the servers.
[4:13:29] retrowaverr: you're also not used to all the roads again yet

[4:13:36] Nemo68tv: It's there such a thing as a universal top speed?
[4:13:39] BurrowsForge: Often they limit the number of super fast police cars
[4:13:43] Starsickle: You can even make transmissions CVT by giving them only a single gear and it's as horrible as you'd expect IRL LUL

[4:14:01] Mariya_Miran: KKona The Ol' E-Peen-350 with the lift kit.
[4:14:04] Cromicus99: Some servers make it hard to get the very fast cars by just raising what it costs to buy and a weekly fee per car
[4:14:11] 4enzic: @chrissy1337 that would be hilarious to watch these kids try to drive manual
[4:14:21] an0____: It's because this server is at end game practically already, however it has always been notorious for being very fast car chase heavy, and people being sweaty and knowing every trick on the map.
[4:14:24] Cannibal_Clown: Eli you old enough to remember Jordache jeans and Members Only jackets?  :p

[4:14:35] breaker5024: sheriffNOTES
[4:14:39] mobius1989: I’ve seen speed limits on cars on other servers and only personal cars can be upgraded to go faster
[4:14:41] Matt_Kitten: @BurrowsForge I get that, but at the same time, PD have to feel like they can actually catch the crims. These rocket ships for every civ car get excessive
[4:14:41] jenntacles: @4enzic there’s be even more cars littering the roads lol

[4:15:23] 4enzic: @jenntacles job security for Eli
[4:15:33] Ares2132: they need something to end all the chases like a rocket propelled deterrent sheriffWOT
[4:15:34] Cannibal_Clown: I'm a tool...
[4:15:40] Chrissy1337: you are basically forced to use the Charger to keep up on those kinda cars
[4:15:53] Matt_Kitten: @BurrowsForge except now with all the crims having radios they get their buddies in on the chase playing defense with a dump truck
[4:15:56] SolemnAngel: To be fair some of these crims would give a cruiser a run with a tricycle if they got hold of the local pixie dust
[4:15:59] Mythrando: no car go above 200
[4:15:59] Donnellpj: let’s be honest, they’re the keystone cops.

[9:46:00] jackbowwower: can you ram with someone in the trunk
[9:46:03] darkposeidon121: Eh real life there is no way the police would allow it to come down to a pursuit they would negotiate until there is no possible grounds for negotiation before sending in SWAT to deal with it, but the way the game is set up and all this is the only way to do it allow they to get into a car chase
