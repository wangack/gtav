[9:17:39] uncreative1100: throw it out and right click
[9:17:40] MarcFiend: Surf and watergun on slowpoke would be a big help for the fire gym but the thing is that once he dies your pretty much screwed
[9:17:40] goldexp123: @UberHaxorNova Should you have a list of all the psychic/steel pokemons or do you wanna go and just find out for yourself
[9:17:43] wavybaker: you should be able to clear the fire gym pretty easily with water moves on your slowpoke
[9:17:45] Rinoura: throw them out and right click
[9:17:47] pockiitta: @bapplesas i might do the same if i don't put an alarm to wake me up xD
[9:17:48] bebo_bobo: surf best move
[9:17:49] TheGoon3: @gentlb0y exactly. That's why he should wash it off
[9:17:54] FlashingPringle: send the mon out and click it was the tm
[9:17:58] greatgrandg: Take out the Pokémon then hit it with it

[9:22:08] ItsYeshalot: are you able to build up and dig in from the outside?

[9:22:50] glasses_Blac: Look for another
[9:22:51] Div_the_Penguin: try the gacha thing ?
[9:22:57] goldexp123: @UberHaxorNova Should you have a list of psychic/steel pokemon so you can check or do you wanna figure it out blind
[9:23:04] aegismonsoon: u can stop them from lvling up by disabling it in the summary menu just like the L
[9:23:07] MonteVidi: one more level and slowpoke should evolve @ube3
[9:23:09] Rinoura: @Div_the_Penguin Cool down
[9:23:10] MonteVidi: oop
[9:23:13] MonteVidi: ube3
[9:23:17] sonasne: how effective would it be to get one pokemon very strong and farm XP candies from bosses?
[9:23:22] ratsinmyeyes: Ube3
[9:23:24] h0neybadgerz: Alakazam is super fast and has high special attack if you can lvl him for better moves
[9:23:25] dannydubbs: kinda useless unless they run into it
[9:23:33] goldexp123: yeah I guess so
[9:23:37] ScottFromScotland: chat would call out any you can use anyway.
[9:23:40] bigjay308: Its not really gonna unless you can actually find them

[9:24:46] tombovard: or if I PM to one of you
[9:24:50] aegismonsoon: You can disable your poke from lvling , like toggeling it in the summary page just click the small L in the top right of the pic of the poke
[9:24:50] bootypopper: You want ice fairy or rock they are all weak to steel
[9:25:12] dannydubbs: muk KEKW
[9:25:28] Jaco_Garci: Steel is weak to fire, fighting, ground

[9:48:20] VulcansHex: Slowpokes yawn will work great
[9:48:23] POOLSHERE: So when using quick balls just throw instantly then exit if not caught then repeat

[9:48:48] TheDarkRedbird: Quick Balls don't work after the first two or so turns, after that they're useless @UberHaxorNova
[9:48:49] glasses_Blac: Run and try again
[9:48:51] Fincoad: yea run and quick ball
[9:48:58] asurasmath: is timer balls good
[9:48:58] MarcFiend: quickballs are usually just to try and catch it right out of the gate you probably want to get different pokeballs for after the 3rd turn
[9:49:09] ItsYeshalot: honestly you're better off running after each quick ball throw
[9:49:13] MonteVidi: dusk balls or timer balls would be real good
[9:49:14] FOFFE94: Quick Balls are only effective if you use it first thing in a fight, if you fail to catch, you need another ball @uberhaxornova
[9:49:22] asurasmath: ok

[11:06:41] MonteVidi: better than rock climb I think
[11:06:42] ItzGalaxyyyy: its stab atleasy
[11:06:42] raisinpuff55: you wanna keep iron defense
[11:06:46] dannydubbs: probably better than rock climb tbh

[11:06:51] kierancreates: iron defence is kiunda crap

[11:07:08] narararan: maybe switch ingrain with leech seed later
[11:07:10] goldexp123: Iron Defense is important for stalling so you can let Toxic do the work
[11:07:11] Mythic_Catan: James the stall game is strong with you
[11:07:13] FlaccidMeatFlute: Teach Ferro Power Whip
[11:07:13] ItsYeshalot: rock climb if you do anything
[11:07:15] RezaQ8: Could replace rock climb
[11:07:17] bs_memes: You do get STAB with mirror shot
[11:07:17] ArrenZzZz: mirror shot is stab
[11:07:18] h0neybadgerz: i would leave it
[11:07:18] FriedKhoi: If you spam iron defense, he'll be pretty tanky
[11:07:18] cmSomber: mirror shot is special it would do nothing
[11:07:19] dannydubbs: iron defense gets 1.5 attack bonus
[11:07:21] BrooksOsborne: bin rock climb
[11:07:21] MonteVidi: keep rock climb
[11:07:25] sentai1_: dont get mirror shot then
[11:07:29] CaptainRedwake: Mirror Shot is stab. so it is stronger than shown
[11:07:30] memerman1001: SirSword
[11:07:31] dannydubbs: i mean mirror shot
[11:07:34] eBean_: mirror shot actually does more damage because its the same type as ferrothorn
[11:07:35] kierancreates: mirror shot lowers their accuracy as well
[11:07:36] icelikesrice: Chat and @UberHaxorNova I forget, are they allowing EV training?
[11:07:39] MonteVidi: yeah the plate could help
[11:07:40] bs_memes: Mirror shot with STAB is 90
[11:07:40] lycopodiophyta: 85 accuracy too
[11:07:42] ArrenZzZz: and also STAB
[11:07:43] sentai1_: rock climb better, it confuses
[11:07:44] MonteVidi: yeah
[11:07:46] ItzGalaxyyyy: its stab and plate would help
[11:07:46] ItsYeshalot: at this point its preference.
[11:07:46] MclovennMeals: no
[11:07:50] raisinpuff55: yeah the plate would hel
[11:07:51] MonteVidi: I think so with the plate
[11:07:53] ba0fe: not worth it keep the plate for another poke
[11:07:54] TheDarkRedbird: probably
[11:07:56] dannydubbs: mirror shot gets bonus dmg because of same typing

[11:08:06] bs_memes: Mirror shot over rock climb by STAB
[11:08:07] perry_bond: You can relearn moves later with a NPC
[11:08:07] MclovennMeals: dont do it

[11:08:18] wavybaker: keep rock climb
[11:08:21] Tretsky: by 20 percent it will raise to 78
[11:08:22] ItsYeshalot: Its preference at the moment @UberHaxorNova up to you, ferro is set up pretty nice either way
[11:08:23] Renucleus: Plate and STAB would be prety good
[11:08:24] eBean_: Mirror shot is 1.5x damage because it is steel type
[11:08:24] TheDarkRedbird: ffs chat
[11:08:26] MonteVidi: you can always use the plate later on someone else and also get a different move later so I'd say go for it @UberHaxorNova
[11:08:29] Kale_kio: you can also relearn the move later on
[11:08:29] Mythic_Catan: Screw it just get rid of rock climb
[11:08:29] FlaccidMeatFlute: Rock has better coverage then steel
[11:08:30] lycopodiophyta: @conashore as if hes getting arceus
[11:08:32] 0xygenhomie: stab is 50% boost?
[11:08:32] ItzGalaxyyyy: STAB and plate
[11:08:36] MarcFiend: Honestly its completely preference
[11:08:37] Renucleus: Could always make room for a better steel move down the line
[11:08:37] SchmittyVA: You might want a damaging move of the same type on him, since that does more damage.
[11:08:39] TheDarkRedbird: What @MonteVidi said
[11:08:40] bs_memes: STAB and Plate and its good
[11:08:41] FOFFE94: should be able to re-learn Iron Defense when you actually need it from an Npc
[11:08:41] MclovennMeals: lol i know right
[11:08:50] MclovennMeals: dont see james getting hiom
[11:08:54] FlaccidMeatFlute: Rock has better cpverage
[11:08:55] 0xygenhomie: stab makes it 95 then before plate
[11:08:55] MonteVidi: yeah no reason not to
[11:08:55] Puffyc7: 65x.20 + 65 = 78
