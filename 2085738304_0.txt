[3:28:24] natikar: either several cops have misunderstood it for a very long time, they've changed how its applied or Gatsby is wrong yeah LUL
[3:29:35] Alsefixx: Is it only charge or the other or is it that resisting is the only thing you can charge the passenger with?
[3:29:43] Alsefixx: one*
[3:29:59] sreylas: How can it be reckless if you're just sitting there not doing any actions
[3:30:23] natikar: yeah agree if they'd seperated it out they would have had to touch on dahlias circumstances more

[3:31:57] TumNarDok: not-stacking is more of a policy though not a law, right
[3:32:26] BadRabbits: okay so it's....stacking? stacking is the judges responsibility to prevent, right?
[3:33:07] Dagarul: Jason saying he was driving proves dhalia cant be charged for that instantly
[3:33:10] BadRabbits: so she's saying if the driving wasn't reckless, it would be two charges or resisting?
[3:33:15] BadRabbits: *of
[3:33:21] Alsefixx: Question... if someone tried to off someone, can they be charged with attempted and assault?
[3:33:29] Bruvverbean: hella confusing, something must of changed, Gatsby is normally very by the book
[3:34:12] MrSpiny: If someone helped get a swap going
[3:35:06] Dagarul: the lawyers still talking to gatsby?
[3:35:10] BadRabbits: so my assumption here is that by the letter of the law, gatsby (purely ruling on the charges presented) is correct. but the charges presented weren't the ones that the pd normally push because there are better ones?
[3:35:31] naturewise17: ouch

[3:36:46] Alsefixx: Apart of me feels this situation was orchestrated by doj/crane cause it creates situations like this
[3:36:58] BadRabbits: ah, okay, so because the charges overlap, they were hit with both the overlapping charges when usually one would be dropped to prevent stacking
[3:37:22] BadRabbits: (assuming accomplice to reckless is a thing now)
[3:37:47] BadRabbits: so wait hold on does this apply to all driving felonies?!
[3:38:02] GrumpyMark01: If this is a change, theb future cases will be interesting
[3:38:04] Ravidge: Lovesick is also going hard explaining how no one is ever charged with accomplice evading
[3:38:09] BadRabbits: if a cop gives reckless driving to a g6 van, does every other passenger get the felony?
[3:38:15] GrumpyMark01: *then
[3:38:20] sreylas: who was the arresting officer?
[3:38:25] BadRabbits: because there will be no g6 drivers remaining

[3:39:01] Bruvverbean: ALOO Mac, got a target for you
[3:39:14] BadRabbits: i feel like the cops wanted to hit everyone with a felony to just get someone to talk
