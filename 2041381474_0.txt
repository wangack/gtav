[3:07:21] veteran_porkchop: Andi straight up said ADMC would be a better fit for him than PD but he’s welcome to come join on the shenanigans
[3:07:41] theworstpriest: THE AUDACITY
[3:08:05] Thrath: Can't believe Andi tried to poach someone that was a free agent to give him an opportunity /s OMEGALUL
[3:08:06] LolmanScott: merger?
[3:08:09] Tyler4AM: Ziggy sits in a car while Andi pitches her Paleto idea to Reed, Ziggy sounds interested in the idea and Andi says he's free to join if he wants, ANDI IS FUCKING OVER BARRY WTF
[3:08:12] symptms: YEP
[3:08:13] Foxe_fox: i still see people complaining about the merger
[3:08:25] Purpurescent: Communication is a two way street NODDERS
[3:08:43] lblvckmvgicl: how could andi jones do this Kappa
[3:08:54] inus2: I'm pretty sure that was said on stream at the time Andi found out also, that it was kinda hurtful NODDERS
[3:09:46] Tyler4AM: Negative chatters will hear what they want and don't want to hear in order to fit the narrative they already had set in their head
[3:10:08] Thrath: Both groups have moved on so why is it still being brought up kivaWhat kivaLUL
[3:10:12] Vizi797: NODDERS
[3:10:27] orangermp: NODDERS
[3:10:33] wizardiis: NODDERS
[3:10:36] LolmanScott: coulda talked about sharing a house that woulda been a great way to share plans
[3:10:39] wroyce: NODDERS
[3:10:40] Purpurescent: NODDERS
[3:11:07] Tyler4AM: I honestly think chatters got a little too invested into the idea of the merger before the details really got shaken out, and then went full doomer when things inevitably fizzled out
[3:11:15] LolmanScott: yeah the first few meetings didn't go that great
[3:11:23] LolmanScott: like neither came out crazy enthusiatic
[3:11:41] honor234567: Im just saying i was ready for Orange Dennim
[3:11:44] Vizi797: Yea, "A meeting of the minds to make something new" got turned into full merger and blown out of proportion massively in meta chats immediately
[3:12:10] CautiousDani: Heavy emotional damage fr
[3:12:14] uitzui: ^
[3:12:19] theworstpriest: It was really just a small blip on the radar
[3:12:30] LolmanScott: @Vizi797 I saw it skip that and go straight to hoa join the bbmc
[3:12:37] DJ_4point0: People spiraled hard at the first mention of the merger. Some into fan fiction territory. Then get all upset when that fan fiction did become reality.
[3:12:55] EverHero_: kivaCheer
[3:13:06] DJ_4point0: Didn't*
[3:13:11] FaultyModule: As much as I love both groups, I  honestly never saw it working out anyways since to me it seemed the ideologies of the two groups are different
[3:13:14] Foxe_fox: They wanted a takeover
[3:13:16] Rtik: "whaaaattttt my head cannon didn't happen? Reeeeeeee"
[3:13:19] theworstpriest: it was also more than a month ago now LOL
[3:13:23] Tyler4AM: They got too invested NODDERS . Completely unrelated though, if Andi doesn't leave the PD and start a new gang I'm unsubscribing
[3:13:28] tadjh_: Sounded like a patch over
[3:13:38] LolmanScott: seemed like they thought ant and siz needed a leader chalupaKEK
[3:13:42] Foxe_fox: No
[3:13:43] tadjh_: No
[3:13:48] Thrath: From the other POV
[3:13:51] Thrath: They mean
[3:13:55] Vizi797: I think that's how it got taken from their POV yea
[3:13:59] Conasht: Barry made it sound like it was
[3:14:23] Jerco2020: Maynnn where all the good trees at
[3:14:34] Rtik: Good trees dont exist
[3:14:37] Jerco2020: kivaDesk
[3:14:40] inus2: I think it always seemed like the HOA was a real mc instead of a parody also, so patch over would be the logical continuation with a real mc kivaLUL
[3:14:42] uitzui: they heard what they wanted to hear because ideas are very rigid with some people. Like even some saying "Andi can lead the civ side of operations" is really showing how linearly categorized some thinking is
[3:14:48] uitzui: instead of having new ideas and fun plans
[3:14:58] LolmanScott: also feel like the timing was off no matter what with people barely starting and then the holidays
[3:15:08] Thrath: @uitzui That stuff was wild KEKW
[3:15:25] theworstpriest: Ant is UNGOVERNABLE
[3:15:38] x_silentqueen_3: marielHi
[3:15:39] Foxe_fox: that was a wild take KEKW
[3:15:44] LolmanScott: @uitzui yeah the ammount off ant is a civ and only does civ stuff blew my mind
[3:16:08] Jerco2020: Ant is a bank Busta
[3:16:15] Foxe_fox: Wauw so nice of them widepeepoHappy
[3:16:19] Tyler4AM: The whole "Andi can't handle gang relations" shit is so highkey sexist lmao
[3:16:20] wizardiis: kivaSuffer
[3:16:21] CautiousDani: Ye the “Andi is civ” “no crime” kivaSuffer
[3:16:21] Zudoba: kian's business is VERY manly KEKW
[3:16:25] Thrath: Like if you wanted to do comparisons Andi technically did more in the criminal ladder then Barry but still they both are crims OMEGALUL
[3:16:35] x_silentqueen_3: Jerco2020 uwuFLOWER
[3:16:37] theworstpriest: Clean?? yikes
[3:16:41] CautiousDani: “maybe clean” fr tho
[3:16:44] Jerco2020: kivaMad uhnGun
[3:16:49] Tyler4AM: Yeah same, it's like she can't handle it yet did it for a literal year lol
[3:16:56] Rtik: serial killer andi chalupaNODDERS
[3:17:03] Vizi797: I was gonna say, I must have missed the clean comments kivaLUL
[3:17:07] Tyler4AM: Andi has never committed a crime
[3:17:08] uitzui: meanwhile Kebuns metachat was like "we hope Andi calls K about this because he will fold so hard to her" kivaLUL
[3:17:08] Rtik: full circle
[3:17:12] CautiousDani: Na na the joke kivaLUL
[3:17:22] Ehnita: Yeah, it's like people are unaware HoA did the casino. With Andi!!!
[3:17:25] LolmanScott: Just because hoa plays the fool to distract from the crime doesn't mean they don't do crazy amounts of 'crime'
[3:17:42] Vizi797: NODDERS Fleecas -> Oil Rig was all Andi
[3:17:46] theworstpriest: anyone who thinks Ant is anywhere near a Civ is stuck in 2.0
[3:17:49] honor234567: Andi has held conversations with Death im sure she could handle measly gang members
[3:17:57] PolishFalcons32: Ant facilitated a nuclear warhead to be transported lol
[3:18:01] CautiousDani: Led the crime ladder NODDERS
[3:18:01] tadjh_: ppl still see end of 3.0 HOA as how things are
[3:18:10] kdsloth45: Super under rated
[3:18:23] Tyler4AM: I swear meta chats did a memory wipe once 4.0 started and think that Andi is in 2.0, doing scooter drive bys and running the gas station
[3:18:25] TKE_Super_Dave: You do have to remember not everyone sees all that goes on outside their groups though, that goes for viewers too.
[3:18:42] theworstpriest: one of the most versatile characters on the server ON GOD
[3:18:49] tropictr3: If anything, Andi is one of the biggest jack-of-all-trades in the group
[3:18:49] LolmanScott: that tone shift in the BSK meeting that andi pulled off to deal with it after the casino fallout was amazing
[3:18:49] x_silentqueen_3: chalupaNOPERS
[3:18:53] Rtik: gas stations chalupaSuffer
[3:18:59] Foxe_fox: They remember she was mayor, but thats about it KEKW
[3:19:14] Tyler4AM: @TKE_Super_Dave As a counter point though, if you're a viewer and know you're not getting every view point then why talk as if you are
[3:19:26] Thrath: @TKE_Super_Dave See the retort to that is people were given the other side of that POV and also just repeat their already pre-existing notion
[3:19:35] Vizi797: Andi definitely hasn't murdered multiple people and helped smuggle a nuclear warhead into the city. NOPERS
[3:19:39] Conasht: literally the main point of her being mayor the last time was literally to pardon Yeager
[3:19:53] LolmanScott: @Tyler4AM yeah to a single pov watcher ant is barrys sister and don't get any more context
[3:19:59] x_silentqueen_3: Andibesti
[3:20:03] orangermp: People will pick and choose what they want to understand and see
[3:20:03] Ehnita: I guess from outside PoVs they only really see Mayor / Survivor stuff. Unless you watch HoA you wouldn't know how much crime she does.
[3:20:07] Scanda4: Ant going on back to back hot potato jobs because she was only one around to hack
[3:20:11] opalducky: Trees Modcheck?
[3:20:28] x_silentqueen_3: kivaBobble rukaJAM
[3:20:31] sage40k: to me it just felt like the whole "new" thing was forgotten after the first meeting lol
[3:20:38] Tyler4AM: Like I watch from mostly a single POV, and will fully admit half the time I have no idea wtf is going on outside of this one lol. I'm not gonna try to argue I know what's happening with Barry or ADMC
[3:20:43] Vizi797: I forgot about that. Andi having to do back to back hot potatoes because she was the only one that could get into the bank kivaLUL

[3:21:42] Nightbot: Kappa
[3:21:47] Thrath: Can I point out one thing I found super funny that someone said? kivaSus
[3:21:49] PolishFalcons32: I think people also forget that Ant helped and nurtured a lot of the people that have historically stepped up for the gang like Luis, Rod and Nico
[3:21:58] PolishFalcons32: Others as well
[3:22:19] LolmanScott: There is just more than one type of criminal
[3:22:28] Thrath: Apparently Andi should be defending Barry in HOA meetings when him or BBMC/ADMC is brought up KEKW
[3:22:52] Ehnita: Yeah, you would think BBMC fans would have some understanding of crime Andi.
[3:22:59] PurplexityGold: LuvSign Kiba~
[3:23:03] TKE_Super_Dave: @Tyler4AM I hate to say it but I've seen some of the convo's they are just expressing how they view it. It only looks like they are arguing if you don't remember they don't see the other side
[3:23:05] wizardiis: KEKW what
[3:23:07] uitzui: ye her not jumping down peoples throat for any half sentence they percieve as sleight is Andi completely failing Barry
[3:23:09] Thrath: Yeah its wild KEKW
[3:23:11] Tyler4AM: You should know your character better than yourself, Kiva
[3:23:30] theworstpriest: I mean the Casino alone is more than enough to prove she isn't a civ. people are whack
[3:23:32] Conasht: does Andi even know about ADMC? has she been told anything about it
[3:23:40] PurplexityGold: Now every motion or generic gyration Andi does, all I hear in my head is Dancing Queen~ beautStare
[3:23:43] Necro_Ex_Mortis: Yeah, I've seen that a few times, the Andi agrees with Siz when he shits on Barry.

[3:24:13] RadahTatTat: *is
[3:24:15] LolmanScott: @Conasht yeah ant just goes up and say so lets talk about this merger chalupaKEK
[3:24:25] LaochCeltach: some upset that Andi dared to poach Ziggy even do she told him to pick admc

[3:24:57] Vizi797: I thought it was Pete saying that at first kivaLUL
[3:24:57] RadahTatTat: @LaochCeltach no way andi could've "poached" ziggy cuz he was a free agent KEKW
[3:25:23] LolmanScott: the biggest poacher is timezones  anyway KEKW

[3:26:53] Sapphire_Tears: chalupaNODDERS chalupaNODDERS
[3:26:53] RadahTatTat: Siz comments seemed more 'disappointed dad' than malicious IMO
[3:27:04] Sapphire_Tears: psycho chatters don’t see any side but their own

[3:27:26] theworstpriest: Siz is a monster, but for other reasons
[3:27:30] Ehnita: Yep, Siz seemed more disappointed in Barry then shit talking him.
[3:27:31] Tyler4AM: The fact that Siz even admitted he'd be a great leader if it weren't for only one factor is massive praise lol
[3:27:49] LolmanScott: yeah makes me wonder if people don't know what respect is, because siz shows barry CRAZY respect for how much he know him
[3:28:02] Tyler4AM: YES
[3:28:24] Tyler4AM: Sorry this shit tilts me, I gotta stop lol
[3:28:33] RadahTatTat: siz wanted to work WITH barry which is rare/crazy cuz siz HATES PEOPLE AAAA
[3:28:34] Conasht: yeah all it takes is one perceived slight and they throw ALL the toys out the bag
[3:28:45] x_silentqueen_3: Tyler4AM RukaPet
[3:28:51] Thrath: aint now way
[3:28:58] Thrath: Please tell me thats a meme KEKW
[3:29:08] Zudoba: how dare you not sugarcoat it
[3:29:12] uitzui: @primblock, chatters pushing narratives that make streamers not deal with it is sad kivaSmug
[3:29:16] opalducky: Just saw murder kitty
[3:29:24] Tyler4AM: @primblock Was this sarcastic
[3:29:25] Ehnita: How dare Siz say it like it is SMH

[3:31:26] Jerco2020: POG
[3:31:26] Nightbot: POG
[3:31:44] x_silentqueen_3: POG
[3:31:44] RainbowTacos1108: It's a weird time in the city where people are hyper focused on setting things up. So an elephant that may or may not be in the room starts to appear to take up space.
[3:32:01] elvic_: you and the mods do a good job of keeping stuff positive in your community which i do appreciate kivaLove
[3:32:07] Tyler4AM: Ok they weren't being sarcastic
[3:32:08] Jerco2020: Huh
[3:32:11] Thrath: The issue can also arises that yeah people can differentiate between character and streamer but some don't so when narratives get driven some people go the extra mile sometimes

[3:34:09] uitzui: i think the new thing was the town all along
[3:34:11] x_silentqueen_3: I'm happy the convos you and Erin have its really cute I'm glad andi has someone to talk it out too uwuLOVE uwuCUTE uwuFLOWER
[3:34:12] RadahTatTat: building a cult *cough* ...i mean town instead of a neighborhood  NODDERS
[3:34:14] uitzui: and that is cool enough
[3:34:15] LolmanScott: maybe they've never heard of the concept of parody
[3:34:25] Thrath: Even if the gang stuff isnt new the environment is new and that is good enough to create new stuff
[3:34:34] 420thMagicMan: it may b the same thing but the place and project is different enough to be new
[3:34:36] x_silentqueen_3: RadahTatTat uwuCULTIST
[3:34:40] Jerco2020: Can you plant your own trees because it's hard out here trying to find good trees maynnn kivaAH kivaAH
[3:34:42] Tyler4AM: Yeah let's not act like relocating to Paleto and attempting to create a whole ass society isn't a big change too lol
[3:34:51] Sapphire_Tears: Most members in groups are the same but in different locations too. Everyone is starting somewhere different
[3:34:55] x_silentqueen_3: Jerco2020 chalupaNODDERS chalupaNOPERS
[3:35:11] LolmanScott: The structure and ideas laid out at that meeting felt pretty different tbh
[3:35:21] Jerco2020: @x_silentqueen_3 uwuDED
[3:35:24] Vizi797: I can't believe they called Lil Sanguine Pod District a rerun kivaMad
[3:35:25] monteczer: "succesful gang in paleto" is already a massive achievement tbh
[3:35:31] x_silentqueen_3: Jerco2020 uwuLOVE uwuLAUGH
[3:36:01] tadjh_: neighbors peepoHappy
[3:36:17] LaochCeltach: paleto will have at least 4 groups / gang not as if its mirror park all over again
[3:36:18] lord_dragox412: Non-mechanic driven RP in the boring part of town NODDERS
[3:36:25] uitzui: i don't even really care about individual groups in Paleto, i just think the town and society project is creative and a really new idea
[3:36:50] 420thMagicMan: the only 3 things u need then would b: mechanic shop, restaurant, and hospital
[3:36:53] Tyler4AM: If the notHOA actually makes Paleto a hub they will have done something unprecedented across like 5 years of RP lol
[3:36:59] Tyler4AM: Outside of the farmer's market era
[3:37:18] Ehnita: Yo, Mike Block could really lay low in Paleto dawg
[3:37:19] Keeb_city: paleto = one of those witness protection towns lol
[3:37:45] monteczer: yeah also, if paleto manages to catch "that weird town up there" feeling that's great, more developed version of MP
[3:37:48] Zudoba: other members becoming leaders also changes it up
[3:37:53] Thrath: There is a reason people are gravitating up there right now yeah
[3:38:04] wroyce: NODDERS even if its not entirely new, theres a reason people tend to follow
[3:38:24] veteran_porkchop: it’s also that all of these people are really nice and fun to be around with, it’s tough to create something new without them
[3:38:24] LolmanScott: like think about what MP became from the idea that spawned it
[3:38:50] Thrath: Even though the group isn't new the people moving there are which creates new dynamics in itself and situations which just makes more new KEKW
[3:39:02] LolmanScott: now the aim for paleto is even bigger than what was for hoa/mp
[3:39:39] elvic_: even the meeting yesterday felt different especially with someone like Lizzie being so vocal which was so nice to see
[3:39:44] Ehnita: I think Lizzie n Reed plus potentially other ex DD down the road changes up the dynamics of the group a good bit
[3:39:57] uitzui: amen kivaNotes
[3:40:02] wizardiis: NODDERS
[3:40:06] Vizi797: Civ gang saved millions of dollars while being one of the first to rob the casino. Civ gang is pretty damn cool NODDERS
[3:40:26] jahsoone: People jus need to sit back and enjoy the show
[3:40:30] lord_dragox412: Gonna need a Siz X Barry smut reading to solve the tension Kappa
[3:40:31] RadahTatTat: yeah and how quick bbmc chatters wanted andi to be the leaders of the 'civ side' if the groups merged KEKW like andi doesnt do crime lol
[3:40:49] Conasht: as soon as Barry and Andi talk these people will act like they never had a problem
[3:40:56] Tyler4AM: I like when meta chats focus on sharing meta across the city for peeps that can't watch every POV and not nitpicking character decisions NODDERS always better that way

[3:42:15] LolmanScott: yeah there some people who just love to interpret things the worst way
[3:42:22] Tyler4AM: Let's not call out anyone in specific
[3:42:42] DreamX2: chalupaSuffer
[3:42:51] scribeklio: I think it's just a mindset difference - ADMC stuff tends to be more serious so they can't really clock what's not from the District
[3:43:05] AdamElJefe: damn, can't believe you found out I've been hate watching for, checks notes, 35 months Kappa
[3:43:15] luixkx: They don't like creativity
[3:43:20] lord_dragox412: @scribeklio "More serious" meanwhile Ziggy: "How about we dress as Toy Story characters to piss off Barry" KEKW
[3:43:22] ellesmaria: thats what i was thinking lol
[3:43:23] RadahTatTat: those comments are self-reports peepoGiggles
[3:43:29] uitzui: yeah not wrong
[3:43:32] orangermp: Preach
[3:43:34] Okamaui: infortunately, youre probably not wrong KEKW
[3:43:35] chilledaudacity: Grrr women
[3:43:39] Tyler4AM: Very funny you say that lmao
[3:43:39] toastandbutter: this reminds me how the actor who played Joffrey in GoT got so much hate for the character he played. it must be worse as a streamer because streamers are more accessible than actors
