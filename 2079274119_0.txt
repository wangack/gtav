[4:58:25] Britterz: @shadowvale81 yeah thats what I thought... but making beer is ok
[4:58:25] the_juggernort: possession is not a charge
[4:58:27] SuperKoorie: i'm gonna say they can only charge trespassing
[4:58:46] WikiDic: being labelled prob get done for intent to distribute
[4:58:53] Sheckley_SO: Is that cranes cop? PAUSERS
[4:58:57] RS_Paul: @the_juggernort I'm sure having over 8 bottles is a felony charge

[4:59:06] Krisgadgets: yh thats why they So Eager To Take Pics When they can
[4:59:16] whipster453: I mean in 3.0 cops had to sit an get pics of sales otherwise it was useless @whippy
[4:59:16] WikiDic: its all extra rp content
[4:59:23] JimBrodie: The whole marked and ready for delivery is a huge assumption on their part.
[4:59:32] shadowvale81: @britterz comes down to license and regulations really, can be sold if tested and all that but that take money of the top hemce the illegal sales
[4:59:43] Nomad_Ninja: He was claiming someone snitched the process
[4:59:44] Mr_AIien: "Brewed by Gheto Kaibac | BBMC"
[4:59:47] SuperKoorie: so they get a trespassing alert and roll up to see what they can see?
[4:59:57] RS_Paul: or you found it?
[4:59:57] Britterz: @shadowvale81 you can brew here for personal use
[5:00:01] TronWeasley: Possesion sounds better to me

[5:00:20] kilakyle05: Especially on route 68
[5:00:24] Nomad_Ninja: i mean, buying isn't selling, its just posession
[5:00:36] WikiDic: its dundees special medicine

[5:00:38] 1barron1: or found it

[5:01:13] TronWeasley: whipKK Honorable
[5:01:20] JimBrodie: E85 at the pumps isn't E85 so you got your own for consistency.
[5:01:26] Kronzo: and their vehicles area crazy

[5:02:45] ReaperUK: They can only go with what the cops say if you don't give them an alternative.
[5:02:52] JimBrodie: The truck is agricultural and doesn't run on pump gas very well, hence the shine.
