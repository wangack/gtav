[2:46:55] Casper7s: @Extrudees Cats are extra sensitive to pyrethrins and pyrethroids (common insecticides). Check what your bug spray contains, if there is nothing on the bottle then google the MSDS for the product you used. I honestly wouldnt worry about it, but if your cat starts panting with its tounge out then I would consider bringing it to the vet. Make sure your cat has access to lots of water
