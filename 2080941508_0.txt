[5:25:54] Amandathecookie: tommrow
[5:26:08] Rufish: @Halifaxzen It really depends if they code GTA 6 with multiplayer support from the start or not.  But considering they bought FiveM it is highly likely that the ability is there on PC release, but mopds will not
[5:26:17] XPixelartX: 3 years
[5:26:25] hpc_young: Did you seen deans take on this ?
[5:26:30] VerityNS: Yeah

[5:29:02] VerityNS: Im fairly certain that Rockstar is wanting a bit of the RP cake besides just selling copies of the game
[5:29:07] Rufish: A Lot of it also depends upon how much code from GTA V RP can be reused or not.  Like if everyone has to start over from scratch then it could take a long time to get fully fleshed out servers.  But like no time at all for basic servers
