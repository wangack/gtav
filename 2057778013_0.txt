[5:27:07] Ginoveli: well i'll be
[5:27:17] AgadhiTheGreat: The sad part about it is, he wants the Civ jobs to be nerfed so that crime would be more profitable but honestly that's a bad take, imo of course
[5:27:28] elmangoust: who's the best driver in this car??
[5:27:38] slicedloxonasiago: @AgadhiTheGreat crime jobs should be more profitable but significantly more risky
[5:27:41] Slaydess7: you guys almost end up in water again LUL
[5:27:44] niteflyeruzi: So, how long until the next high-speed windshield egress?

[5:29:45] slicedloxonasiago: @AgadhiTheGreat agree'
[5:29:48] AgadhiTheGreat: @slicedloxonasiago I agree with that, I also think that the civ jobs are just fine, somebody's got to make money and you shouldn't have to do crime to make good money
[5:30:03] GunsOnBuns: DinoDance
[5:30:07] Ginoveli: try making the chips levitate
[5:30:10] Schleten_: Wow shake doesn't even wanna touch me.. I see how it is

[5:30:53] MatscherPlatscher: no crime should always give more money because you can lose it all
[5:30:54] spartymarty: they need to find the balance
[5:30:55] Ginoveli: risk for reward is how it goes normally though
[5:30:55] crazyiitopii: @agadhithegreat i understand this is RP but if you think GTA was Invented for civilian jobs your crazy
[5:31:00] Schleten_: Brie use that spell from Harry Potter with the chips.. Windgardum leviosa Kappa
[5:31:02] Raivolver: robbing full t3 truck is like 9k nbow, right?
[5:31:02] Ginoveli: unless your a petty thief
[5:31:03] KaBoomGodTV: GTA = Sims
[5:31:10] jas3y: i think g6 and grime are more of a time investment than crime too tho right?
[5:31:12] Tenivir: yeah if crim feels too lucrative then everyone is cop vs crim all over the city
[5:31:12] Phasehero: GTA is a game about crim, like THAT'S the base of the game
[5:31:14] ekahS_: @Schleten_ it's levio-saaa
[5:31:23] Ginoveli: higher the pay more time you do in jail
[5:31:32] ironbullman: spawn

[5:32:10] JonasPolsky: acieWADDLE
[5:32:15] Hikamari: orange house icon next to the hairdresser
[5:32:16] Madknightwolf: I think problem is they don't want crime to be one person job. A group should split up process
[5:32:24] slicedloxonasiago: @Phasehero AGree
[5:32:35] Ginoveli: money matters a lot more in RP than Online
[5:32:40] Slaydess7: the whole point of an RP server  is to make something kinda "real"
[5:32:46] Schleten_: Well I wish I shared my heart with Emma Watson Shake
[5:32:48] realJokoWidodo: this job good for you to learn driving

[5:32:53] Tibs97: peepoSitHey
[5:32:53] KaBoomGodTV: its pretty balanced if u take out all these steps
[5:32:54] Tenivir: i think the crime stuff atm is more balanced around several criminals doing diff parts of the job so to speak
[5:32:58] Roro_____: she has to do it 10 times to be done
[5:32:59] Dumi90: she has to do it 9 more times
[5:33:01] jas3y: i think trying to balance running 500 g6 runs vs yoinking 1 truck is the issue
[5:33:03] renaldorini: Crime being worthwhile makes PD better too which been seeing a lot of complaints about them lately
[5:33:06] Tenivir: some are doing jewel runs while others get and sell parts etc
[5:33:10] Mr_Tvi: @ginotori no its not
[5:33:12] Tibs97: @rollo_tt ?
[5:33:14] KaBoomGodTV: this run was for only 200 of her 2000 jewels
[5:33:23] Tibs97: angy
[5:33:24] Rollo_TT: @Tibs97 Hello peepoHappier
[5:33:26] Karmas_Weapon: Maybe they need more incentives besides money, like doing a certain thing long enough gives access to buy special things
[5:33:26] crazyiitopii: It's gonna have a bit of a roller coaster feel until it balances
[5:33:30] Tibs97: @Roro_____, ü§ù @Rollo_TT

[5:34:13] deviusdark: margin is so small for that
[5:34:13] Slaydess7: what Civ needs is just business update, grinding is boring, but business RP is cool
[5:34:14] ChadoyEarle: Other people do it like that @acie
[5:34:17] Mr_Tvi: @ginotori one perico  heist takes 1.5 hrs with all prep missions usual take is 800k-1.2 million solo

[9:20:12] LeakDaTV: How so?
[9:20:12] blackdoos: it was not a scuff, it was just a bad implement
[9:20:14] wolfgang_86: Yeah its stupid they might have been a hotfix or scuff no shot they would keep that
[9:20:14] guzeriz: @Acie why they made crowbars limited at the start to 5 crowbars per server?
[9:20:15] SaltiBanana: ya it wouldnt b on purpose
[9:20:16] Nulltiply: ReallyMad How dare you?

[9:20:39] thebeaverlover: drone conspiracies NotLikeThis
[9:20:39] Black_Griffin: ye they took the system down to find a solution to people stealing each others drones. they added 5min wait to fix it i guess, thats it
[9:20:41] M0hkofantti: I think it was tape fix for issue that the drones were spawning top of each other
[9:20:41] sourstuff: or the devs are low iq
[9:20:47] SaltiBanana: it always temp tho
[9:20:48] LeakDaTV: Hopefully he gets prio soon
[9:20:49] pineapplegladiator: There is a reason for this server being whitelisted with applications

[9:21:03] beebooqc: at least for the start of it
[9:21:08] Praskle: just to limit progression I guess, the other option is people being bored in a week
[9:21:08] Tenivir: yeah the way they implemented them were a bit weird
[9:21:10] mrgamer0909: @CRlCK you too dud
[9:21:13] jbt445: they start with stuff super limited to incentivize buying prio but eventually you will get stuff if youre no prio

[9:22:51] vPenguiin: Characters that are friends or close to devs, gets whitelisted for content first
[9:22:55] cristina217: it‚Äôs better to add things slowly so people don‚Äôt quit the server so fast
[9:22:56] ToTheSameHeights: seems to be what the devs want now
[9:22:59] MrLebowski_: not 2 months thats cap
[9:23:02] Mr_Tvi: +1
[9:23:03] Kenjack1984: they should have made the robberies require 6 people and you can only do one then more gangs could have been involved
[9:23:06] iHarsh29: this gang is so stupid LUL
[9:23:06] sSpajk: Well the money was at the END of 3.0. It also had slow progression
[9:23:07] Whamabamallama: wee woo
[9:23:10] RasenRendan: if no one has anything to do the game will die
[9:23:12] 42arc: biggest problem is giant gangs with major amount of helper drones, it's just unfair to others
