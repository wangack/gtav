[7:50:56] suphoe69420: yes
[7:50:57] Rohanone1: what happen is CG took over PD
[7:50:58] thats_sweet5: @ZK4i the charge is having it not shooting it
[7:51:00] p__dragon: x plant, judge was gsr positive.. k's plant, he was gsr negative
[7:51:02] GabeAOD: They need to rewrite it
[7:51:03] TropicalToucan: K mad he probably reasonable doubt but he needed an alibi/affirmative defense. 0% chance they change the law.
[7:51:03] MAB09x: yeah, K wasnt even GSR pos
[7:51:07] jackthedazzle: i mean was likely yea since pd and law need change
[7:51:07] MrFullM3talX: it's gona bring so much shit rp if it's removed. every criminal's rp when caught is gona be: not mine lel
[7:51:08] Striimimuija: The issue is that you have to proof that the gun was planted on you

[7:51:21] rulerofdoge: they get 1 day in prison too LULW
[7:51:22] ralfeezy: 2 GPUS OOOO
[7:51:28] tyrannuswrecked: I think the point is that you’re carrying a gun in commission of a crime. there’s no plausible deniability
[7:51:31] Sirlambsalot: @GotMilk30 Not yet and he only found out after he got 6 PD guns LUL
[7:51:32] reezyy92: whats the butc/day
