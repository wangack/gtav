[5:08:22] DoomsdayBomb: They are doing bandaid "fixes" for symptoms instead of the core issues
[5:08:23] MsAutumnWind: they balance the banks around the 1% high tier crim groups, it makes NO sense
[5:08:24] BiggerDangDude: @Glancing that's what i'm waiting for too
[5:08:25] AmnestX: thing is too that the criminals feeling held down leads to some of them acting salty and feeds more into the drama that Snow was talking about last night. it's a vicious cycle
[5:08:27] ThePressedMan: Hacker cooldown is cool.
[5:08:34] stukamod: MMORP thinks otherwise
[5:08:35] GalatiaAK: now it is just boost all day every day pepeW
[5:08:43] kjax: have to use your fingerprint on the laptop and it gives the individual a cooldown
[5:08:49] drzug: A puppet master for heists could be good
[5:08:54] buddha_hands: @MsAutumnWind they tend to balance more than banks that way lol guns etc
[5:08:54] Actual_Nicotine: Yup an extra 15k means nothing to the people who are already the ones spamming the banks Sadge
[5:08:55] Lanthin: this feels like a temp solution until they can implement something like you are saying with putting the hacker on a cooldown

[5:09:43] Actual_Nicotine: @Devomatics It is tbh, James' idea of putting the cooldown on the person instead of the bank is a good solution
