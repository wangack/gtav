[4:13:38] Deakula: @Geek_Mode_Gaming Archival purposes; in hundreds of years from now, people will study NoPixel as ancient art.
[4:13:40] Criarcy: why James
[4:13:43] StupidPlainName: @Geek_Mode_Gaming BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GODS
[4:13:53] shut_up_luffy: Hmm im new to all this so its all gibberish to me

[4:14:44] Deakula: And I'm actually being serious; NoPixel roleplay is an absolutely groundbreaking art format, and it will be worth study in the future when it's no longer practiced
[4:14:57] shut_up_luffy: @mrpith either way its very funny
[4:15:01] shut_up_luffy: so im having a good time

[4:15:18] Deakula: @Geek_Mode_Gaming I sincerely hope so
[4:15:25] Geek_Mode_Gaming: i associate GTA RP more with D&D but i dont generally do the cops and robbers bit
[4:15:31] WorstGamr3: @Deakula i dont think its fair to single out nopixel. there are alot of great servers out there
[4:15:38] perselance: You're one  of the only entertainers that I'd happily watch at  a table read  @Spaceboy
[4:15:39] StupidPlainName: @Geek_Mode_Gaming me too
[4:15:52] Deakula: GTA RP exists because things like D&D existed before it (and still do)
[4:16:08] Geek_Mode_Gaming: facts
[4:16:11] GiraffeCubed: GTA:SA had a huge roleplay scene too
[4:16:17] Deakula: @WorstGamr3 Semantics. GTA RP as an artform.

[4:16:53] Geek_Mode_Gaming: Worldz end was fun for a while
[4:16:55] shut_up_luffy: what are those youd reccomend to people who would prefer not to stream it?
[4:16:56] LaikaInMyDreams: One thing I like about cop RP is the diverse cast. It's a different vibe to gang RP where it's very tight knit.
[4:17:07] EvilRemanant: Have you tried playing on other servers?
[4:17:08] ConnorLikesCar: im really intersted to see what the FIveM devs that got hired by Rockstar do

[4:17:38] Deakula: Can you imagine a time where GTA RP no longer exists, and new generations are studying it in art school going "wow! our ancestors used to do that for fun to tell stories?!"
[4:17:38] ironfoxx6442: @spirostanfieldgames2008 he ded
[4:17:45] JoshTheCarrot: never been a fan of Gang RP.
