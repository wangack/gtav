[3:12:02] urso_skibidi: LETSGOPOLICE LETSCRIME
[3:12:08] anextremeemo: Ignite had a rule about having to talk to cops for at least a minute in a traffic stop
[3:12:09] Rozzy15: but what about my pogs broooo
[3:12:12] newmeta44: can I call cops CRINGE?
[3:12:13] WitchyVixen: @Fleajunk Dragging you into crazy more like LUL But that's Jolene

[3:12:28] GooberAG: aleksPop
[3:12:30] Fleajunk: yep KEKW
[3:12:30] WitchyVixen: @PartTime_DreadLord TYSM witchy72Kiss
[3:12:32] TheVektorMan: I still find the idea daunting of hopping onto a server like this if you do not have any experience with roleplay.
[3:12:33] notledo: Can I tell them I want to SKIP pentawBeef
[3:12:38] urso_skibidi: yeah but have you consider duckass aleks?

[3:12:49] Rozzy15: pentawBeef CRINGE
[3:12:50] Pigs_on_the_Wing: thats the irony. good cop servers make for better crims.

[3:13:10] Bigusacokis: @aleks an interesting thing came up the other night when I got my ID stolen and it made for wild ass RP and also a change in how people get IDs replaced if stolen Gladge
[3:13:11] ken_mayor: rules? yawn
[3:13:29] 0ryc: whats the ratio of cops to crims?
[3:13:41] RyuShinden: Mike Block does that mostly @aleks
[3:13:41] littlepixellady: I finally got to watch other part of the serial killer RP story. Scary...
[3:13:41] RolosGaming_CH: Hey Aleks, dont your eyes hurt with those colors?
[3:13:46] quickswiitch: Criken with his 1 joint Sadge
[3:13:49] PartTime_DreadLord: Give them a hood quest dangNODDERS
[3:13:59] RyuShinden: Mike Block does that mostly. Sometimes, people he robs turns into Blocks @aleks
[3:14:02] SargeAngel: set them up to potentially get your ass back
[3:14:04] themrdino: I like this server because it feels more like you're there for the RP and not about 'winning'.
[3:14:10] Kirchmeista: Mike Block always says his name LUL and then they become blocka
[3:14:10] articpuffin: One of my favs crims is gordo

[3:15:09] themrdino: @WitchyVixen I will never understand the people who are there to win. It's not in the spirit of RP...I've been doing it for 18 years. People who have to win always ruin it.
[3:15:16] ken_mayor: @thievezy yep
[3:15:17] TheVektorMan: How would any of you start off trying RP?
[3:15:23] Kemli: kyleisShy

[3:17:24] Mad_ManTV: watching helps learn things like using emotes and /mes
[3:17:25] Dildozerfred: inaps*
[3:17:25] AGoodEffort: I actually want to try it now after watching a ton of ONX, the past servers I haven't felt that way
[3:17:26] RyuShinden: I have technically started playing D&D to get my RP experience. That translated well
[3:17:28] TurdStretcher: TheVektorMan Just go do it. All of us used to play pretend when we were young. Everyone knows how to do it. There's no one person that's better than another at RP.
[3:17:30] 0ryc: yea, ive been watching people play for awhile. just waiting for backlog to join now
[3:17:32] TheBadkins: new sub aleksDinkDonk
[3:17:33] Oppositeness: improv is hard NODDERS
[3:17:34] Arteimis: !onx
[3:17:34] Streamlabs: Welcome to ONX. A new gaming community with a focus on roleplay. Check out the cinematic trailer for everything the server has to offer so far https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BdqpQOSF-s | onx.gg
[3:17:35] TheVektorMan: Ive been watching since you did armaRP
[3:17:35] MLEcake: id rp my hgart out
[3:17:39] MisterTohru: a bunch of the cops started off as just viewers
[3:17:39] MLEcake: heart
[3:17:47] newmeta44: How much do I need to know GTA to apply / play on the server? I've never played but want to apply
[3:18:04] Doomneto: rp is improv and improv can be practiced, you just have to start somewhere
[3:18:05] Arteimis: @newmeta44 as long as you have gta5 you can apply
[3:18:07] Oppositeness: very talented NODDERS
[3:18:09] ShawnD__: you just need to know how to play video games tbh
[3:18:11] ImminentFallout: @newmeta44 Some onx streamers have never played gta before so you're fine
[3:18:19] RyuShinden: @TheVektorMan It will feel daunting at first. I have mad social anxiety, but slowly you'll realize that you're actually having fun
[3:18:20] newmeta44: @Arteimis alright thanks ok
[3:18:26] Arteimis: the application covers all the rp stuff that you need to know and onx is very good for new rpers
[3:18:28] TheVektorMan: @TurdStretcher Yeah that feeling of playing pretend is definitely a main positive point.
[3:18:28] taleofmj: Finally got the nerve to send my app in last week now just the waiting game
[3:18:31] littlepixellady: I would consider trying RP, but I gotta get better equipment, etc.
[3:18:43] WitchyVixen: When you've got good people to bounce off of, the rp comes much easier tbh
[3:18:44] kiba592: look at this little crew tho
[3:18:51] ken_mayor: wait for this eulASS
[3:18:54] RyuShinden: @newmeta44 Dont need to. Funnily enough, a LOT of GTA roleplayers never even touched the single player campaign KEKW
[3:18:55] TheVektorMan: @RyuShinden I guess that would be the major hump to get over
[3:19:10] Arteimis: true Ken
[3:19:13] OMGitzClayAiken: yo aleks first time i was introduced to u was demo disk
[3:19:15] HowdyAves: Penta on Mike Block is really good with having new players tag along in his chaos lol

[3:20:28] MLEcake: munkey
[3:20:30] TheVektorMan: @RyuShinden The idea is still daunting but i might give it a shot.
[3:20:33] Nhylus: I just know you as the 7 Birches guy who roleplays in Japanese
[3:20:33] Arteimis: @alrightsimon oh my god

[3:21:17] Soulstiger: Hitting those cars is just good business move
[3:21:17] MLEcake: rust has a lot of rp servers too i feel like all online games do. could start with any of those just to get the hang of it.
[3:21:20] anextremeemo: server crashes
[3:21:20] Arteimis: !who
[3:21:21] Streamlabs: Aleks is RPing on ONX and you can check out other RPers through this link: https://onx.hasroot.com/

[4:57:04] Jogiiee: @p_dandy its okay, he cannot stop our mom love
[4:57:07] Sarahbear1234: DUCK WTF
[4:57:07] J_to_the_jf: could I create a gang that if you die in game your character is gone forever? or would that not work cause it would be considered meta?
[4:57:07] duckrudder: thx ken u always got my back
[4:57:14] p_dandy: peepoShy true jogiiee
[4:57:16] ken_mayor: o7
[4:57:23] Sarahbear1234: KEN
[4:57:30] p_dandy: KEN
[4:57:31] RyuShinden: @J_to_the_jf Perma is up to the player
[4:57:32] Dalzino: @J_to_the_jf how would that be meta?
[4:57:33] ken_mayor: counting chat is not evil wtf
[4:57:37] harriettheegg: o7

[4:57:51] Mad_ManTV: @J_to_the_jf would be tough to get people to aggree and actually follow through with perma contracts
[4:57:52] kiba592: vibee
[4:57:56] TheBadkins: vibee
[4:57:57] Sarahbear1234: Counting chat needs an exorcism
[4:58:03] J_to_the_jf: @Mad_ManTV ya that's what I was thinking
[4:58:07] ken_mayor: your cooking needs that more
[4:58:10] Jogiiee: black would be nice if we did the logo in white.
[4:58:12] Daggerww: goodnight aleksUrock it’s been a good night
[4:58:12] Jogiiee: which i can do
[4:58:14] Sarahbear1234: My cooking is fine
[4:58:16] ken_mayor: gigl
[4:58:17] MacAttack713: white kinda funny, especially if it never got dirty
[4:58:23] kiba592: Ruiner posting
[4:58:23] J_to_the_jf: @Dalzino cause they'd have to agree to delete the character if they died
[4:58:25] Stefffy01: i got some nuggets chat nuggiee
[4:58:26] RyuShinden: @J_to_the_jf It's ultimately up to the player if they want their character to permanently die.
[4:58:29] urso_skibidi: white is some john wick shit
[4:58:32] TheBadkins: Sleffy nuggiee
[4:58:32] zombre: what about the name the white machine for the shop
[4:58:35] ken_mayor: nuggies pogg
[4:58:36] p_dandy: Stefffy01 nuggiee
[4:58:38] TheBadkins: Steffy nuggiee
[4:58:38] J_to_the_jf: @RyuShinden that's what I thought thanks
[4:58:40] ken_mayor: nuggiee
[4:58:43] Stefffy01: nuggiee
[4:58:45] MacAttack713: zombre bro
[4:58:54] alrightsimon: white would seem like u escaped insane asylum
[4:58:57] IM_GOING_GOBLIN_MODE: @J_to_the_jf you coudl do it just communicate to those who join the gang what your expectations are
[4:59:10] Tekko_o: could make the wolf white and the circle red with the red eye
[4:59:10] zombre: @macattack713 it comes full circle
[4:59:16] spaceromantic: LETSGOOOO EMS
[4:59:18] J_to_the_jf: @IM_GOING_GOBLIN_MODE but then wouldn't that break RP rules being like hey your character is gone forever
[4:59:27] Sarahbear1234: Good night yall aleksH
[4:59:28] ken_mayor: pepoYELL LETS GO EMS
[4:59:33] J_to_the_jf: AYYYYE the symbol of my people FeelsGoodMan

[4:59:45] ken_mayor: gn sarah bejj
[4:59:50] p_dandy: awe goodnight sarah bb
[4:59:50] Stefffy01: Wooo EMS
[4:59:58] Sarahbear1234: @alrightsimon maybe in the casino
[4:59:59] RyuShinden: @J_to_the_jf Also there's nothing meta about it. Metagaming is when you use player knowledge that your character has no way of learning beforehand.
[5:00:07] Jogiiee: @Tekko_o I'll mess around with it tomorrow a bit and see what I can do and try to put it on the jumpsuits.
[5:00:30] urso_skibidi: @J_to_the_jf perma conditions are up to the people; not the causality, so if you agree with others that that is the case for joining the gang OOC, i'm sure they wouldn't mind
[5:00:31] J_to_the_jf: @RyuShinden ya but breaking the RP by acknowledging that you're a character in an RP server
[5:00:31] TheBadkins: @Jogiiee Jogiiee is goated
[5:00:37] MacAttack713: maksim looks like he's never worked a day in his life
[5:00:37] Tekko_o: yeah it could give it that jdm vibe
[5:00:46] alrightsimon: nodd
[5:01:29] alrightsimon: @MacAttack713 he needs a sugar parent figure
[5:01:35] MacAttack713: undercutting the competition, shrewd businessman
[5:01:46] Stefffy01: KEKW
[5:01:51] alrightsimon: ayo
[5:01:52] KingVolk_: KEKW
[5:01:52] MacAttack713: yes GIGACHAT

[5:02:20] TheBadkins: Mechanic da i fix ambulance
[5:02:24] spaceromantic: hehe hubcap
[5:02:33] ken_mayor: its time Plotge
[5:02:38] J_to_the_jf: to be fair your character does look like he'd be eaten alive in a gulag. Bit too "pretty" but I dig this character I'd help him LUL
[5:02:59] Jogiiee: Okay, I am gonna dip and go rp
[5:02:59] MacAttack713: Mechanic looks like you're missing a few parts, that'll be $20 extra

To start, think of a character you want to be or a scenario you'd like to explore. Then, interact with others by staying true to your character's personality and motivations. Remember to be respectful and considerate of others' boundaries. Have fun and let your imagination shine!
