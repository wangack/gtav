[3:41:13] fyisic: Sadge Thug life is hard
[3:41:22] SwitchBord001: I have a morning ritual that I need to share. I call it "the terminator". First I crouch down in the shower in the classic "naked terminator traveling through time" pose. With my eyes closed I crouch there for a minute, visualizing either Arnold or the guy from the second movie (not the chick in the third one because that one sucked) and I start to hum the terminator theme. Then I slowly rise to a standing position and open my eyes. It helps me to proceed through my day as an emotionless, cyborg
[3:41:26] SwitchBord001: The only problem is if the shower curtain sticks to my terminator leg. It ruins the fantasy.
[3:41:34] Trae618: They either drop the drama or yall leave

[3:42:37] Mr_Nee: is lenny still around?
