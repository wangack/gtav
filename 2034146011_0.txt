[3:26:52] anchorblues: @fatalfoo_fn How does that work?
[3:26:55] yarninel: you need to do both
[3:26:57] pronprimel: the only way would be to make the gap as big as the glass
[3:27:00] SupaIkemen: you could use two walls to make it slightly thicker
[3:27:01] eclipsevendetta: double the wood pieces and clip them together for more wood space
[3:27:03] endiiiio7: What about small glass
[3:27:03] JooshWasTaken: oh
[3:27:03] hellaslastchance: both
[3:27:03] yuzi999_: position
[3:27:12] Gersheyz: isn't Y up and down?
[3:27:12] theroganjosh: if you increase the distance b/w the two wooden walls
[3:27:13] riorobinio: maybe small glass?
[3:27:28] walsallsteve: Double thickness on the wall then single glass in the middle
[3:27:29] haydz_hk: Can you make the wall 2 thick a the glass in the middle???
[3:27:31] Asheeshl: @booomic hmm I tried for the last one can duel me for 10k need to finish the monthly quota
[3:27:36] zorak222: make the wall thicker using two wood pieces?
[3:27:45] Emma__Bot: rotate if it’s rectangular??
[3:27:47] imogenthis: is there a smaller one? may have to adjust the spacing in the mid too
[3:27:54] Gersheyz: does that say Bulletproof!
[3:27:54] hamedahmadi: hire cydney 😁
[3:27:55] haydz_hk: Can you make the wall 2 thick a the glass in the middle????
[3:28:06] tuvix2: Some small house plants or pieces of art would look better there than the glass

[6:24:58] Drakoncheto_: so you can watch a clip of him saything the code but not "take a picture of the PC screen" with your phone in RP
[6:24:59] fRodyy_: pretty sure he got all 3 from audio no? Ray__C
[6:24:59] Shadowhaox: gotta replay his audio on the phone at 0.25x speed LOL

[9:56:41] wolverine_1909: @tokMC chill bro
[9:56:43] error_code5: I mean the decisions could be stupid but it makes it interesting that’s my take like who cares what the company does. them being the villains in the server makes everyone else have a better experience anyways

[9:56:43] lilstiick: @B0unty___ which i dont really mind, i think this is fun. But people acting like its realistic or that X is handling it with logic is just stupid

[17:08:05] irmatt2: what if you put the gpus that are in the linked computers in to the rack, since it seems like the rack overrights the gpu from the computer
[17:08:06] Brandonxftw559: Can you link more then 1 computer to a rack?
[17:08:09] qHaydos: hes saying as time goes on u can buy more more often

[17:11:49] JayThaCollector: HI DEVS
[17:11:50] D_OmeLoL: what if after the scuff is fixed you can link one rack to multiple pcs ??
[17:11:54] iFADEDAFi: power seams high but i dont really see any lights in other houses tbh
[17:11:54] bb8077: @shark_whole there's a date soon KEKW
[17:11:55] COZRx: call kit shes crying
[17:11:55] keesoofly: @freaksho_ 5 Bitcoin down to 1.4 a day idk that’s kinda crazy
[17:12:02] Wa5tEd: Small GPUs are worth it
[17:12:07] devath_3: you can just move 1 computer to your apartment each @ray__c
[17:12:10] Wa5tEd: It's the same EV
[17:12:14] MountainMAN1990: @shark_whole that was excellent but it was a frime she wasn't streaming it Sadge
[17:12:14] uncle5id: I'd just build another rack and throw some of the gpus in it.
[17:12:15] erquilene: can you link multiple pc to single rack ?
[17:12:15] e1k4bong: Keep the pcs for now to farm up necessary coin, later revamp
[17:12:18] Shark_Whole: @cozrx  dont be weird
[17:12:18] p__dragon: 3 racks per pc mhm
[17:12:18] DannyVespucci: who could afford to buy these at this point in the game though
[17:12:21] trapstoned: @COZRx wait she's not streaming on which streamer did you see her
[17:12:21] fahd_g: you can’t sell the computers because you need the butcoin that they produce for now to buy blue prints because they run out
[17:12:26] SleeperDays: I feel like you guys might need to stop Jason and his crew since they trying to sell PC's cheap
[17:12:28] SurvivorPlayz999: tru
[17:12:28] chandler2813: They want to move all this now but it could change tomorrow lol
[17:12:36] devath_3: you can just move 1 computer to your apartment each. just farm them @ray__c
[17:12:42] COZRx: @Shark_Whole  its a yoke
[17:12:50] Fedoreos: @keesoofly Yeah, but you don't need a desk+CPU+HDD+apps, and its low power.
[17:12:53] kineticdevice: @aaahhhgeeezzz he disappeared for a sec.  When x first got cuffed..  said he was taking care of it.  So i think so
[17:12:56] Wa5tEd: You are getting 0.2/250 per circuit
[17:12:58] stonedcoldfpv: I would build a 2nd rack and use the 2nd 6060 to test if multiple racks on one pc
[17:12:59] KillerKolsch: Ray always thinking!  Nice
[17:13:14] keesoofly: I agree with X you’ll make more without the racks
[17:13:15] h4des__20: I can see that in a week the Company will be pumping pumping the BTC
[17:13:26] ragenbeast1: So question is the kitchen able to be put back in
[17:13:26] Reeps_100: Power build is gonna hit even harder
[17:13:27] MountainMAN1990: Yea its power cost verse bitcoin count for sure
[17:13:28] someonecreepin: @devath_3 somone can steal your stuff if the door scuffs
[17:13:29] knowbodyrva: should you take out the GPUs from the PCs without SMokecrack and put in the rack?
[17:13:30] landlord_97: LUL
[17:13:31] Wa5tEd: Building the small GPUs are still the same expected BUTs
[17:13:34] D_OmeLoL: basic gpu give 4x the performance by hooking it with a pc compared to the gpu rack
[17:13:44] SurvivorPlayz999: no
[17:13:45] p__dragon: apartment pc is not reliable
[17:13:52] xgspidermonkey: No lol
[17:13:54] Hinatainn: maybe 1-2 weeks of Waiting before selling.

[17:13:55] TheBigMike95: the ceiling is the perfect height for that rack
[17:13:56] COZRx: @D_OmeLoL the upfront cost is also higher
[17:13:56] RapidIQ: no
[17:13:57] KimParktsingLee: isnt it better to just have everyone have 1 pc mining in their apartments?

[17:14:28] D_OmeLoL: yes but the whole point is printing as much coins as possible
[17:14:30] Bachelur: the rack does connect to multiple computers , but probably shouldnt
[17:14:37] shadexdomo: 1 BP per rack is crazy
[17:14:41] isaias_lion: hmmm a Rack irl can connect to many computers
[17:14:45] keesoofly: unless the new 6060 makes it worth but don’t seem like it
[17:14:46] McCape7: So you can have 3 racks, 30 gpu's controlled by 1 desk nice
[17:14:55] shadexdomo: i feel like itll get changed after today lowkey
[17:14:56] isaias_lion: a server is basically a Rack
[17:14:56] SurvivorPlayz999: 4 btc a day
[17:15:00] travsmyth: price per but :P
[17:15:03] kronn505: HUH
[17:15:06] HyperNoxious: New GPU only benefits when in a rack
[17:15:07] Hinatainn: #1 #2 #3+ can be connected in one PC.
[17:15:08] NoDont: the hype around the new GPU people will probably overpay lol
[17:15:12] ML_Mystic: PRICE PER wideduckass
[17:15:15] fireyabby: You can transfer all the buttcoin onto the main computer by puting thr cpus into the cpu rack and dupping it all into the wallet
[17:15:17] Wa5tEd: Price per BUT is the same for small GPUs as for the big GPUs tho
[17:15:29] sebzinald: X is right he is struggling to explain very well pog
[17:15:29] isaias_lion: so technically it should connect too various pcs.
[17:15:30] flicklin: try and rent a house with utilites included, then scam the landlord with the power bill
