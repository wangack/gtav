[3:04:36] SeedaSantos: If you click on it in the list and click edit, it doesn't bring it near you?
[3:04:37] olGregg13: does it think its tied to washing machines ?
[3:04:49] thizguyfawkes: fingers crossed then
[3:04:54] ItsEdBoi_: He  had the same problem removing the 1st bench after the 2nd was place, think they all have some sort of shared inventory
[3:05:06] CdnGrimReaper: i thought the panel tells you how much you can use
[3:05:10] outsideinsiders: what‚Äôs the power at? now that the kitchen was removed
[3:05:11] Datursa: inb4 the furniture stash bug appears twice instead of fixing the first one KEKW
[3:05:11] Hey_its_Mady: Does discarding the whole shopping list delete it?
[3:05:27] outsideinsiders: ah
[3:05:33] KGLynch3: 145 I think
[3:05:42] ChiefKeif: can you search for the storage in the editor and delete it on the lefthand tabs?
[3:05:52] ak47_64: the washing machine will pay for its self and the stash in a few days
[3:05:58] megan_leigh8: Can I just say the music seems to have gotten louder now than it has been earlier
[3:06:02] thizguyfawkes: K pretty much tried all that
[3:06:03] ChiefKeif: just got here tim, i was gettin taco bell
[3:06:16] Vegitto: ye with new stash might be fixable
[3:06:16] Azhogh: Pay attention chat DESKCHAN
[3:06:30] thizguyfawkes: Yeah best shot
[3:06:30] TB318: empty the box first
[3:06:51] d2zq: problem is, all tennants want their own machines, some want a bunch some none but its all shared

[3:08:12] Vegitto: but the power used before the kitchen was like 60's today was like 155, idk what else could be doing that
[3:08:21] d2zq: true LUL
[3:08:23] outsideinsiders: chuck the trash in the neighbors yard. then HOA find them for it LUL
[3:08:30] Hey_its_Mady: The house thinks all benches and storages as one combined storage. That's why to remove one you have to empty everything
[3:08:34] ItsEdBoi_: Every new thing they put in is scuffed to start
[3:08:49] thizguyfawkes: Trash is for Frannies bed lol
[3:09:06] ItsEdBoi_: @Hey_its_Mady Yea thats what i think is happening
[3:09:09] theogbigg: KEKW
[3:09:18] theogbigg: would make sense
[3:09:22] ItsEdBoi_: K had the same problem removing the 1st bench after the 2nd was place, think they all have some sort of shared inventory
[3:09:29] KGLynch3: @vegitto yeah that caught my eye too. very weird
[3:09:39] apaceboldface: lol K using all 3 washer
[3:09:40] thizguyfawkes: trial and error
[3:09:43] Lavitzboss: I think that might be it
[3:09:45] Kdkuiper: k couldn‚Äôt remove the little bench when it was empty but said crap was in it
[3:09:53] ItsEdBoi_: Yea its good to have
[3:09:54] Lavitzboss: Yea
[3:09:59] outsideinsiders: who had the pleasure of moving all the blueprints out the way for the new washers ü§£
[3:10:11] theogbigg: K as gang leader claims all the washers
[3:10:11] Hey_its_Mady: If you empty one bench, it will still show remove items from bench to delete it
[3:10:16] Kdkuiper: make sense
[3:10:20] thizguyfawkes: putting in work
[3:10:23] irishmf_24: Did Vinny take his blue prints?
[3:10:26] thizguyfawkes: somebody has to
[3:10:30] Lavitzboss: Hopefully they charge or fix that cause thats annoying AF if that's the case
[3:10:30] ak47_64: are the washing machines still only doing a dollar a minute?
[3:10:42] CptSpaceBush: @Nitrostealth Yes, but I don't know if Gomer is up to date about it.
[3:10:52] Datursa: Hmm since the error says material box, maybe you only need to empty the "material box" section of benches and it might work?
[3:10:57] d2zq: keep doing it, you are more reliable than most of CG LUL
[3:11:00] Nitrostealth: Gotcha
[3:11:02] R3dl1nes: yup way slow
[3:11:03] ccoolracer128: you might as well take the money since he takes it anyway lol
[3:11:04] Keeper24: I agree
[3:11:14] ItsEdBoi_: Especially if everything is gonna give dirty money
[3:11:19] R3dl1nes: 30 secs at least they should be
[3:11:21] Alltimescumbag: Maybe take his and replace
[3:11:21] ItsEdBoi_: and money weighs way too much
[3:11:22] Azhogh: Imagine 10k LUL
[3:11:30] drabzzz: why dont you use those mats to fix your before they bo bad
[3:11:35] mordhaustv: shouldnt be 60 an hour, should at least be 600 an hour.
[3:11:36] ak47_64: could put them into 2 they'll finish before he wakes up
[3:11:39] thizguyfawkes: Yeah the weight is crazy
[3:11:42] WhoNeedsBullets: you should just manage the dirty money for the boys that way you can claim all the washers yourself. im sure they would settle for like an 80/20 deal @Timmac
[3:11:48] d2zq: wish i could give you the guy to buy it but thats meta KEKW
[3:11:49] Vomica_75: a washer takes 20-30mins for the load lol should do all the rolls in like 15mins
[3:11:50] KGLynch3: yeah I would take his money and then leave your dirty money in there before you get off
[3:11:51] Nitrostealth: Is there any other methods of washing?
[3:11:53] Kdkuiper: it weighs so much too
[3:11:55] Nitrostealth: are there*
[3:12:01] outsideinsiders: at this rate, gomer is going to need to hit the gym , to build up the strength to carry around all his rolls
[3:12:02] killogic916: you can combine 2 at least in like 45m and use the 3rd.
[3:12:07] thizguyfawkes: @KGLynch3 this tbh
[3:12:08] ChiefKeif: chat whats 1 dirty roll = in cash?
[3:12:16] Nitrostealth: $1
[3:12:18] Lavitzboss: House def needs more barrels where you guys can put your own stuff
[3:12:20] fenr33r: laundry business sounds like a good idea
[3:12:25] outsideinsiders: 1 to 1
[3:12:26] ak47_64: combine k's into 2
[3:12:31] thizguyfawkes: Once you know you have time, just dump yours and trade
[3:12:31] arch_dawg: whole server design right now seems intended to force cash to enter SLOWLY into the economy
[3:12:32] KGLynch3: you guys need a big stash
[3:12:40] ChiefKeif: ty
[3:12:42] R3dl1nes: isnt there like public ones too do u think those would be faster but with risk of being stolen by others
[3:12:42] fenr33r: house full have everyone come to u
[3:12:51] Alltimescumbag: @timmac what if you just take before you get off and just fill it back up?
[3:13:02] fenr33r: true, hopefuly get better returns soon
[3:13:03] ccoolracer128: in the end all Gomer's money is K anyway :P

[3:13:10] theogbigg: that would take forever to make back
[3:13:13] mordhaustv: your 70% should maybe be 60%
[3:13:16] Datursa: One day someone will make a house with like 20 washers KEKW
[3:13:18] WhoNeedsBullets: when you have 1000s of rolls coming to you, that will be covered in like 2-3 days
[3:13:29] snowrider3: call big D and see if he got the washer he said he was gonna get
[3:13:29] KGLynch3: Bobby and chodie are giving nothing compared to you guys man
[3:13:44] fenr33r: dam 2.25 days
[3:14:13] fenr33r: per machine
[3:14:28] CptSpaceBush: Wow!
[3:14:32] Azhogh: And that's while babysitting them
[3:14:34] WhoNeedsBullets: its pure profit after that
[3:14:39] ccoolracer128: but everything after that is pure profit tho
[3:14:40] WhoNeedsBullets: long term business
[3:14:43] shred403: thats with 0 downtime too
[3:14:44] killogic916: you need to clean $7500 to pay  it off right?
[3:14:56] theogbigg: straight btw so we talking like a week
[3:14:58] WhoNeedsBullets: then buy it off them for 80/20 and you manage it
[3:14:58] Vegitto: id love to see like 10 washing machines there
[3:14:59] ccoolracer128: thats why you take them for 70% from the boys
[3:15:01] Vectishonor: Wait till others get over trying to clean it themselves and unload their machines for cheap
[3:15:05] ak47_64: isn't one of those yours
[3:15:05] Lavitzboss: Would be nice if you could load up 1000 in each
[3:15:20] KGLynch3: could always sell your dirty money for a little less value
[3:15:21] MrYeOLDsNIPeR: 2.4 days on "one" machine?
[3:15:22] mordhaustv: 2.5 days likely equals 5-10 weeks
[3:15:25] Splitcookie713: you could keep any additional ones in apartment and have that side hustle still
[3:15:27] Keeper24: especially with two crowbars now, they‚Äôll have 10k rolls before 2k gets cleaned
[3:15:31] Lavitzboss: True
[3:15:33] oofles_sadface: how long would it take for 3 a min and 5 a min?

[3:15:53] ThongedSchlong: ask k if u can throw one or two in the rental unit so u can grind the cash out without anbody else
[3:15:56] Vegitto: gonna need to stack wash machines tbh
[3:16:02] ThongedSchlong: until they r finished
[3:16:03] Gatorade_Me_Bish: You need like 15 to make this a full time business LUL
[3:16:06] ccoolracer128: tim, CG has crowbars chopping is going to go crazy lol
[3:16:09] Kdkuiper: does the vu still take crazy margins?
[3:16:10] ItsEdBoi_: It also makes no sense, it should be like a load of laundry, full stack cleans in like an hourish
[3:16:12] Lavitzboss: What you think would be a good time to take. Should they cut the time it takes in half?
[3:16:12] fenr33r: surprised dex doesnt since he only does weed
[3:16:16] YaBroChad: The problem is how slow it takes to clean tbh
[3:16:24] theogbigg: wonder if you can get upgraded washers somehow
[3:16:38] YaBroChad: anyways time to lurk
[3:16:39] ccoolracer128: just fill in the second floor full of them and you will be fine lol

[3:16:42] ItsEdBoi_: That or the VU rep should actually work
[3:16:44] Lavitzboss: Yea
[3:16:46] Splitcookie713: maybe Vinny can give you a loan for you business Kappa
[3:16:52] ak47_64: @fenr33r he can't grow and sell tho has to chose one bc of rep
[3:16:57] ExTempter: 15secs a dollor?
[3:17:04] ccoolracer128: you need to do the second pc now too tim
[3:17:11] Lavitzboss: They need to make it so you can only place those big ones in houses and they go really fast
[3:17:16] Vectishonor: But there is gonna be huge demand for sure. You gotta scale up now and become king cleaner
[3:17:24] killogic916: I think double would be fine. once you have like 10 it would clean quick. that would be 14k per day at 2 per min.
[3:17:24] apaceboldface: ain‚Äôt point fingers but joblessNotes someone point at vinny
[3:17:32] ItsEdBoi_: even just twice as fast would be good
[3:17:36] theogbigg: 4 min instead of 1 a min
[3:17:45] Keeper24: that‚Äôs reasonable as fuck
[3:17:46] fenr33r: more reasonable
[3:17:52] Keeper24: or every 20 seconds
[3:17:52] Gatorade_Me_Bish: How much power does one machine take?
[3:17:52] CptSpaceBush: that seems reasonable, considering you can only load 250 at a time
[3:17:58] Vegitto: how much cash is 2500 rolls ?
[3:17:58] Lavitzboss: That sounds reasonable
[3:18:06] Vegitto: is it same amount ? 2500 for 2500

[3:18:09] WhoNeedsBullets: 8 washers will clean ~500 an hour. 8 washers is 20k. they will pay for themselves in less than a day
[3:18:12] killogic916: yes
[3:18:17] Azhogh: This reminds me of minecraft for some reason LUL
[3:18:20] Kdkuiper: yeah you still then need some one to upkeep them
[3:18:30] Keeper24: even 2 or 3 a minute needs to happen, 1 isn‚Äôt good enough. but it feels like their adjustments have been so slow
[3:18:33] Vectishonor: baked math
[3:18:44] fenr33r: lol
[3:18:54] fenr33r: 2 days
[3:19:00] akira1962: Can you top up rolls that are in there
[3:19:02] fenr33r: if running all the time
[3:19:06] Alltimescumbag: It should be like a wash cycle. It should be able to clean 250 in an hr
[3:19:08] ItsEdBoi_: its 60 an hour, 60 * 8 = 480
[3:19:12] WhoNeedsBullets: 60x8 =480 dollars and hour.
[3:19:15] SeedaSantos: 500 x 24 hours is only 12000
[3:19:21] ak47_64: if all the dirty cash is your but if u only get 30% would take way longer
[3:19:22] Vectishonor: It still takes 2.25 days per no matter how many you got
[3:19:24] SeedaSantos: Not the 20k so no it won't take a day
[3:19:29] Keeper24: how long do you think they‚Äôll keep the economy at a crawl
[3:19:32] killogic916: 2/min and hold 1k  would be amazing.
[3:20:33] ccoolracer128: hell you could buy it as 5per since people probably have a ton of it
[3:20:33] mordhaustv: idk, i still feel like it should be 10 every 6 seconds. you go through the effort of the crime, get away with it, yet you still have to go through the hassle of getting your money cleaned. if the pace is too slow, its a major drag to people who want to do other things too.
[3:20:38] oofles_sadface: i thought he was leaving it in the backyard but i could be wrong
[3:20:53] ak47_64: if u had all those machines might be worth to start selling weed
[3:20:54] Vectishonor: yeah and there is huge demand on the server. its easily way more money per day compared to the real estate returns
[3:20:56] ccoolracer128: you could go there and pick it up
[3:21:05] akira1962: If there's 150 rolls in the machine can you add 100 rolls
[3:21:10] Hey_its_Mady: Just call the dude. Is he making the storage or what?
[3:21:15] Keeper24: yeah it almost doesn‚Äôt even seem worth to do crime involving rolls atm
[3:21:18] ItsEdBoi_: 8 washers would profit 3500 per day, if loaded the whole time
[3:21:38] Gatorade_Me_Bish: What percentage do people get from the VU right now?
[3:21:56] theogbigg: is this the German guy?
[3:22:02] WhoNeedsBullets: my math was a bit off. but either way. in 40 hours, 8 washers would pay themselves off
[3:22:07] Hey_its_Mady: 40% at VU
[3:22:26] WhoNeedsBullets: thats nothing compared to how slow the server is moving
[3:22:46] Vectishonor: you gotta load em up every 4.2 hours
[3:22:49] Splitcookie713: would take at least 5 days
[3:22:53] shred403: you gotta cover all time zones
[3:22:58] shred403: its not fun lol
[3:22:59] theogbigg: 40 hour straight tho, and they fill every 4 hours

[3:23:15] ThongedSchlong: no poiunting fingers
[3:23:42] Vectishonor: just pay someone some change
[3:23:45] dejus12: look on the bright side. All Ks money will be clean and you wont have any xlean money he can get from you ha
[3:23:54] ccoolracer128: if you pay 50-60% that would work alot better
[3:24:06] Lamb_Hawk: not entirely bad but there is a lot of grind in 4.0 it's crazy
[3:24:23] Lavitzboss: Is that just garbage on the top floor in that bag?
[3:24:31] WhoNeedsBullets: its slow money on the washers, but if you combine it with the crafting thing you are doing, it will be good money
[3:24:32] ItsEdBoi_: It would actually take 131 hrs to pay off 8 washers, im like almost positive
[3:24:35] ixbxkillabee: is it really paying its self off if you dont use your own money? and then you also factor in where you got the money
[3:24:45] ccoolracer128: you get like 1k per chop car and people selling weed get them alot too so theres alot of it out there
[3:25:44] Hey_its_Mady: Let's just say he completed forgot about you and doing something else LUL LUL
[3:25:45] Azhogh: The process is very long to move the wood
[3:25:56] MizterCriztopher1: p

[3:35:04] titanvol29: Can you put the car chopped car parts in the box?
[3:35:11] RacefanRacing: I thought you were making a stripper pole for a second LUL
[3:35:25] 88eg: what's the power usage at with 4 washers?
[3:35:31] WhoNeedsBullets: aw. i thought you might be able to jam that outside the house and just leave the light part
[3:35:40] Splitcookie713: an option to make money is craft car parts and sell them. just need to find a mat dealer
[3:35:40] titanvol29: @ak47_64 computer is working now

[3:41:10] RacefanRacing: 1 dollar a minute is pretty crazy
[3:41:15] rdc7: that is so bad
[3:41:30] Keeper24: if they were five the Economy would explode
[3:41:35] RacefanRacing: I think 2 could be okay for this early as a wipe but even then thats low
[3:41:46] ak47_64: even just 2/3 a minute would be way better

[3:42:27] Keeper24: @blacknight2514 5 per means people could chop 2 cars a night for 10k
[3:42:28] RacefanRacing: There is another way to clean money you just loose a %
[3:42:31] WhoNeedsBullets: so much money being lost in the VU
[3:42:35] Hey_its_Mady: Or ask fancy to if he got mats to craft his stuff

[3:45:08] RacefanRacing: Really need to find someone to make clothes or a lil updated ped. Makes me wanna learn it
[3:45:09] BlacKnight2514: @Keeper24 yessir, how is it that snr. buns if you really just grind is still the best source of money in this city and why does the limited crime that is in pay so bad?
[3:45:12] rdc7: lol
[3:45:14] shred403: theres always new people needing computers its not a rush
[3:45:29] shred403: lots of pople cant get in the server for days
[3:45:30] ItsEdBoi_: its just so expensive for ppl, since most are pooling together for a house then u need like 40k for a computer

[3:48:39] 3xevilx: isnt it cheaper to rent a new car rather than refil the gas? Let alone repair it
[3:48:43] Lavitzboss: Yea it's not Worth to buy but could be fun to window shop a bit
[3:48:44] rdc7: @Pikes37 lmao
[3:48:59] KGLynch3: they screwed themselves by having a car cost $100 to rent
[3:49:04] whizkidz22: everything at this point is a money sink.... implementing taxes on past purchased properties explains that
[3:49:10] Hey_its_Mady: Does any devs ever wonder why no one in the server drives a packer LUL
[3:49:11] Lavitzboss: I love window shopping cars

[4:37:10] YaBroChad: Yeah those remind me of the old Dodo boxes from 3.0
[4:37:10] YxtBomb: buying a small would tell you if they work right
[4:37:10] Azhogh: Those would be for transporters mainly, just like the job entitles
[4:37:10] ItsEdBoi_: @lestermatthew The lumber guys do, gomer just bought one
[4:37:12] Graveexode: You put boxs in the box
[4:37:15] olGregg13: might be tod do bigger grime runs ?
[4:37:26] RacefanRacing: They old dodo like boxes i assume
[4:37:27] lestermatthew: The lumberjacks may get the furniture stash boxes then
[4:37:28] Graveexode: Less weight
[4:37:28] cartinwalmar: Maybe it'll just double triple amd quad your delivery totals.... just making more shit
[4:37:30] mordhaustv: i suspect they are just ment to up the amount of boxes you can carry at one while on the job
[4:37:32] Graveexode: Maybe
[4:37:41] YaBroChad: the small boxes are the parcel sized boxes
[4:37:42] Graveexode: Idk just thinking
[4:37:42] elcozitto: maybe it‚Äôs something you can put in the truck to carry more deliveries?
[4:37:45] Azhogh: Yeah, that's my idea too, what's in the box? more boxes KEKW
[4:37:48] Hey_its_Mady: Ask chodie to bring cash to buy small box

[4:37:50] TripleJAllDay: @DrCached i was just scrolling through reels and seen that he is a real person my mind was blown as well

[4:38:19] RagRanger: huge
[4:38:19] ahhjoshy: @Timmac i think they are just containers because zerka asked the admins for a box to do his mystery box RP
[4:38:20] Graveexode: That's what I'm thinking
[4:38:24] dhanaz_: Maybe with that you can bring chopping component more
[4:38:32] RyanTheeBook: maybe for more fragile stuff
[4:38:37] QwerSpammerzz: i wonder what you need to make the large box
[4:38:38] garretth: would these be good to sell to the lumber guys? @Timmac
[4:38:40] Azhogh: That scared the shit out of me KEKW
[4:38:42] Splitcookie713: Probably smuggling
[4:38:45] ItsEdBoi_: What theres like 2 stops u cant hold it in ur inventory? unless u can put it in the truck to get more stops
[4:38:50] elcozitto: all of the above?
[4:38:54] mordhaustv: OH! that could be it, allowing you to use the trucks for your own goods
[4:39:05] RacefanRacing: i think they just like dodo boxes
[4:39:20] Graveexode: I'm thinking weight reduction
[4:39:26] Hey_its_Mady: Yeah lumber guys can carry more weight if thats the case
[4:39:28] Splitcookie713: Or like pile up car parts then use grime van to drive to sewers
[4:39:32] ccoolracer128: you are the only one to find out stuff because you are the only one with the rep

[4:57:31] drewdeezy21: got to talk to taco
[4:57:31] moiborg: fur? n rubber wtf lol
[4:57:35] 3xevilx: better start buying fur before the price goes insane LUL
[4:57:35] Datursa: lasts 48 hours. that's lame xD
[4:57:39] Azz_Crack_Bandit: 48 hours
[4:57:44] RagRanger: furry
[4:57:49] RyanTheeBook: that seems like a f u since hunting tanked your rep
[4:57:58] CrAzYMaYnE: Yup
[4:57:59] rdc7: lmaoooooooo
[4:58:02] welllies: recipes from the mind of a meth head.
[4:58:02] YxtBomb: storage box lasts 48 hours LOL
[4:58:02] Kdkuiper: it‚Äôs def a dodo box then

[4:58:10] RacefanRacing: so its pretty much a dodo box
[4:58:21] RagRanger: they said wanna lose more rep hunting? Heh
[4:58:23] YxtBomb: maybe it still works like Dodo tho just breaks after using it for 2 days
[4:58:27] YxtBomb: repeat business
[4:58:31] Kdkuiper: yeah def like a dodo style then
[4:58:34] danny_t_t: guess the question is how long will the blueprint last
[4:58:34] ccoolracer128: make 1 box to see what you could do with it
[4:58:43] Splitcookie713: team up with union workers
[4:58:43] Vectishonor: for some smuggling or criminal shit i guess
[4:58:43] TheTacticalDonut: yeah but if it's weight reduction, still pretty useful
[4:58:44] ChiefKeif: wonder how much it holds as well
[4:58:45] lestermatthew: that makes no sense because hunting brought down your rep
[4:58:45] CptSpaceBush: you cant hunt because it takes down your rep right?
[4:58:46] awww_peaches: NoPixel loves kicking folks in the nuts LUL
[4:58:47] Sp0rtsjunki3: Maybe that's why hunting lowered your rep? They are in fact connected?
[4:58:48] RyanTheeBook: fur would make sense for a couch but a box!
[4:58:48] YxtBomb: Fur?
[4:58:49] rdc7: since when do storage boxes have time limits wth
[4:58:50] Kdkuiper: still good for lumber and sewer trips
[4:58:53] papafrank97: chop car parts
[4:58:56] Keeper24: the box only lasts 48 or the blueprint
[4:58:57] NoahS116: maybe the smaller boxes are more worth it?
[4:59:01] 3xevilx: Beethoving but strimmer
[4:59:01] cybigil: Still good for lumber and chop.
[4:59:06] RagRanger: panic buy fur from people before price inflates
[4:59:06] oofles_sadface: what about seeing if the other guys will buy the 250 small box to see what that does
[4:59:07] moiborg: should‚Äôve bought a small one to test but still
[4:59:12] ItsEdBoi_: about $600-800 worth of rubber, idk how much fur would be worth, so would need to sell for like 2k minimum
[4:59:13] Splitcookie713: only thing worth is buying a small one
[4:59:14] MauzyMauzy: that better weigh 100 pounds and carry 1k lmao
[4:59:14] Lepaca: just make one Madge
[4:59:14] Gatorade_Me_Bish: 600-800 for the rubber only
[4:59:15] Dustbug: unfortunately we need to make one for science
[4:59:20] outsideinsiders: how much would it cost to buy 30 fur off somebody?
[4:59:37] Pikes37: if you have one box, by the time you have the mats for the 2nd, the first is expired
[4:59:39] NoahS116: testing with the small one could be helpful
[4:59:43] CrAzYMaYnE: Unless used in future
[4:59:44] Gatorade_Me_Bish: That needs a buff
[4:59:46] ItsEdBoi_: Lumber ppl
[4:59:47] RacefanRacing: They were clutch in 3.0 for the weed I remember
[4:59:51] YxtBomb: i mean science can still be done with the small box
[4:59:52] Datursa: would need to see the small one's capacity to get an idea
[4:59:53] Vectishonor: and then spend an eternity cleaning too lol!
[4:59:55] danny_t_t: makes it easier to take to the fence
[5:00:02] 3xevilx: 1 man sewer runs incoming LUL
[5:00:03] RacefanRacing: The space they give you is pretty helpful
[5:00:09] enzo_921: timmacLURK
[5:00:16] Jimthatoneguy: is that big D?
[5:00:17] de_scoot: its not a backpack its probably just likje a furniture chest
[5:00:19] almondmilkwithice: Lumber People and Sani workers
[5:00:21] de_scoot: only work at the house
[5:00:22] RagRanger: panic sell blueprint 25k
[5:00:24] Gatorade_Me_Bish: If it lasted a week it might be worth it
[5:00:33] ixbxkillabee: how much is fur sold up north?
[5:00:34] Gatorade_Me_Bish: days? no shot
[5:00:34] MaxMcGee: buy the small 250 one first and try it out before making the big one?
[5:00:44] Vectishonor: just scam someone and dump the blueprint on them lol
[5:00:47] Kdkuiper: the smaller ones might be more cost effective for people
[5:00:48] bassman7461: Start Hunting?
[5:00:49] de_scoot: 6k for 48 hours
[5:00:50] morries05: sanitation is in high demand
[5:00:52] RacefanRacing: Actually smart to try and sell the blueprint for an outrageous price @Timmac
[5:00:59] Hey_its_Mady: Btw cycle the laundry to start cleaningoney
[5:01:01] ItsEdBoi_: Def worth buying the small one to find out instead of making the big one
[5:01:09] polercap: it‚Äôs more complicated to explain that in rp then game mechanic sense lol
[5:01:12] outsideinsiders: sell the blueprint for double what you paid‚Ä¶ to somebody who doesn‚Äôt know it‚Äôs shit SeemsGood
[5:01:17] Splitcookie713: Rubber can come from towers
[5:01:19] ItsEdBoi_: buy small one
[5:01:19] Hey_its_Mady: *cleaning money
[5:01:22] moiborg: *ad* selling print for box dont have bench lol
[5:01:25] dhanaz_: Try buy small one
[5:01:37] ChiefKeif: 400 rubber i thought, or im blind
[5:01:39] ManagerPeynado: restart the washer!
[5:01:41] notwowayzz: @RacefanRacing smart idea maybe try to sell for 25K and then buy another one LUL
[5:01:46] WhoNeedsBullets: yeah, science the 250 dollar one
[5:01:46] Vectishonor: and waste more money?
[5:01:47] Dustbug: isn‚Äôt 30 furs a lot of money since it‚Äôs $10 per bullet @timmac
[5:01:49] RacefanRacing: easier to just buy the boxes outright
[5:01:57] RacefanRacing: @notwowayzz for real
[5:01:59] Keiling1401: make Bobby "No Job" Brown go hunting for the fur
[5:02:15] NoahS116: yeah gonna cost about a grand in material for that big box
[5:02:15] RacefanRacing: If someone paid 25k for that blueprint, thats a huge come up
[5:02:27] internalin: so expensive for a 2 day box
[5:02:28] ItsEdBoi_: is it me or did that 2nd one clean much faster
[5:02:42] PGMuNrOe: "How can we take more mone7y from Grime Drivers. I know lets make them make a box that dissapears after 48 hours."
[5:03:01] RagRanger: sell blueprint ?

[5:03:50] ccoolracer128: you need to lock the door
[5:03:50] RagRanger: @notwowayzz This.
[5:03:52] ItsEdBoi_: Gotta buy small one to see if its even worth sourcing the mats
[5:03:56] STAKEisFAKEHD: i thought hunting ruined rep
[5:03:57] MaxMcGee: The small one is only like 250 right? Buy that just to see what it does. No sense in sourcing mats yet if you dont' know if it's going to be worth it
[5:04:19] Vectishonor: ^
[5:04:21] polercap: if they are really good like a storage in your inventory you could make soooo much money
[5:04:46] Vectishonor: plus as soon as you make the big one..the timer is on
[5:04:57] dejus12: paris?
[5:05:00] MatterHatter1: @polercap It could help people like G6 carry more bags maybe. That's be huge
[5:05:13] ItsEdBoi_: @polercap 48 hrs makes it sooo bad, only real good efficiency use is for transporting to sewer
[5:05:14] Hey_its_Mady: Is Paris around
[5:05:18] elcozitto: what would the box have to do for it to be worth the cost?
[5:05:21] drewdeezy21: paris on prodigy
[5:05:44] Alltimescumbag: Ask Bobby if signed in somewhere else
[5:06:44] polercap: the time could be on it cause it would be busted otherwise maybe idk would need to see it played with
[5:06:58] fyrybaap: If your rep gets too high with Fence you will lose rep with the Therapist LUL
[5:07:30] RagRanger: sell blueprint 25k then buy another use profits buy mats
[5:07:30] almondmilkwithice: wonder if he has rubber KEKW
[5:07:52] NoahS116: you could see if fancy wants to do a pounder run in the meantime
[5:07:59] Keiling1401: run a pounder with fancy and have him give you his cut as payment for the GPU craft

[5:08:11] almondmilkwithice: yeah keep the blueprint
[5:08:12] manny_281: Yeah never sell it
[5:08:17] YxtBomb: you need to do the research before selling the blueprint
[5:08:20] almondmilkwithice: cause it could change overnight
[5:08:20] WhoNeedsBullets: 250$ box science
[5:08:20] Vectishonor: try the small one for now then I guess
[5:08:40] RagRanger: try small then
[5:08:42] ccoolracer128: he might have rubber
[5:08:47] Splitcookie713: Can always flip boxes like computer desk
[5:08:55] CptSpaceBush: Sit on it, and talk to K about it tomorrow. Maybe the both of you figure out the market together
[5:09:44] RagRanger: fur
[5:09:48] Vectishonor: should be enough for the small one bru
[5:09:51] Alltimescumbag: Fur
[5:10:34] de_scoot: you arent trying to give him the recipe
[5:10:37] ShinJay87: Looks like gomey is going back to hunting
[5:10:40] almondmilkwithice: will it tank rep tho
[5:10:40] MangoGioU: Do hunters throw out the fur thinking its not useful?
[5:10:47] ChiefKeif: have bobby go do that since he cant do pounder maybe
[5:10:55] manny_281: is it?
[5:10:58] cybigil: door locked/
[5:11:02] sandyg3: Lock house?
[5:11:04] Nooms162: the fact you can't even slightly double dip...is hot garbage.
[5:11:12] watertiger1: lock door?
[5:11:25] RagRanger: run over deers and skin em?
[5:11:28] manny_281: try both times
[5:11:34] Kertzstream: could sell x1 for high price (like 30k+) to bank roll the start of you own thing yeah they mite sell as well but you would only have one person to compete with.
[5:12:09] Datursa: Even if it was longer lasting it would still suck as home storage option, cuz benches have thousands of capacity for just a few $k more
[5:12:18] ccoolracer128: but if he made it, he could sell it for like 5k 10 times and he would make more that way
[5:12:21] almondmilkwithice: GGoma time to hunt
[5:12:48] sychotixx: One of the guys in here's voice reminds me of a D2 speedrunner... Ryu

[5:13:43] hunter1319: wonder how many hunting trips it takes for 30 fur, sucks rep is ruined if you do it yourself
[5:14:22] ItsEdBoi_: Makes sense why hunting ruins trucking rep now
[5:14:24] ChiefKeif: 30 fur 400 rubber, i think

[5:54:09] Gh0stPog: OR do you need a fur blueprint
[5:54:10] Bakemaan: maybe its UI bugged?

[5:55:38] 3xevilx: gotta skin all the dogs being killed during chop 5Head
[5:55:40] MauzyMauzy: The first fur is a carryable like wood, maybe it needs to go in the wood section?

[6:08:15] ahhjoshy: RP item
[6:08:18] dhanaz_: Can you Put wheel there
[6:08:23] Alltimescumbag: Scammed lol
[6:08:23] TripleJAllDay: for the benefit for the grind
[6:08:25] ahhjoshy: RP item for mystery box and delivering stuff probably
[6:08:25] Valerian120: more item space i guess
[6:08:26] RacefanRacing: so its slot increase
[6:08:29] Bmx_lang: Gives more slots in a barrel lol
[6:08:29] Vomica_75: its a space saver
[6:08:30] Datursa: Medium is probably like 100, and High is 150/200?
[6:08:34] 3xevilx: for 2 days LUL
[6:08:34] RagRanger: put stuff in ur truck ?
[6:08:35] YxtBomb: its like a wallet
[6:08:36] Lavitzboss: hopefully the large ones last way longer
[6:08:37] YxtBomb: pointless
[6:08:37] Vomica_75: 3 spot down to 1
[6:08:38] Splitcookie713: Space reducer
[6:08:38] ChiefKeif: Place on ground maybe?
[6:08:39] ahhjoshy: cleaner way to trade things like materials
[6:08:44] darkdemonwiz: gives 2 extra slots
[6:08:44] Alltimescumbag: Space lol
[6:08:45] Kdkuiper: prob only last 2 days too
[6:08:46] elcozitto: it just saves inventory space
[6:08:47] wolfski36: Can you place it someplace?
[6:08:49] WolfgangPuckAmadeus: Maybe stuff the truck with weed?
[6:08:50] RacefanRacing: you get 2 slots out of it LUL
[6:08:52] ItsEdBoi_: Only person i see that working for its weed guys who need 4 slots per plant
[6:08:55] Lavitzboss: Tommy T mystery boxes
[6:08:56] sk8mantra22: Is that to replace a box you lose?
[6:09:01] Lavitzboss: thats the only use
[6:09:04] TerrahAustralis: reminds me of putting stuff in the Diablo 2 cube
[6:09:04] Fossabot: Are you playing Diablo 4? Join our community clan! Search for "Tbaggers" and request an invite. SeemsGood
[6:09:05] MauzyMauzy: You got a glorified senior buns container LULW
[6:09:15] Flip25k: can set it on the ground and stuff inside won't decrease?
[6:09:18] Splitcookie713: Like in Tarkov when you stack a backpack inside a backpack
[6:09:24] Kdkuiper: does that hide stuff if cops were looking at your pockets
[6:09:36] wildbur91: fucking bobby dude KEKW
[6:09:44] elcozitto: these containers suck box
[6:10:13] olGregg13: if it goes in the grime storage it might be for drug trafficking ? but still thats shit
[6:10:31] RagRanger: tell chode
[6:10:32] ItsEdBoi_: @Kdkuiper technically but they can just open it
[6:10:34] WhoNeedsBullets: whatever dev is over grime needs a talkin to ItalianHands
[6:10:41] STAKEisFAKEHD: for grime workers?
[6:10:56] War4ire: The ground holds more lol
[6:11:03] WhoNeedsBullets: @Timmac hook up with chodie and see if it will go in the pounder
[6:11:13] Furyform: special discreet delivery kinda box c:
[6:11:18] RyanTheeBook: maybe the way carrying certain things changed, and you need the box to carry multiples
[6:11:21] RagRanger: allows u to use pounder for rec uses
[6:11:29] CptSpaceBush: i wonder with higher rep you can get wood crates? Because they would go with the bigger trucks?
[6:11:39] ItsEdBoi_: Thats a mystery box item
[6:11:52] t_worK: Probably useful to deliver to people using Grime. Under cover
[6:12:04] t_worK: Guessing they'll load into Grime trucks
[6:12:06] RagRanger: sell to the lotto runners
[6:12:21] YxtBomb: could try loading it into grime truck
[6:12:23] RacefanRacing: yeah have to be more to them
[6:12:25] TheTacticalDonut: did you put anything in the box to see if it registers same weight?
[6:12:42] ItsEdBoi_: If it can go in grime truck u can move stuff with it

[6:13:22] RagRanger: yea
[6:13:23] Splitcookie713: possibly do grime in a rental
[6:13:24] ryan__mize: if the large box is 250 then its pointless
[6:13:31] elcozitto: box in a box??
[6:13:38] YxtBomb: thats DEFINITELY it
[6:13:45] bogetti_k24a: Vx
[6:13:51] Shaphilly_: The boxes will be something important soon enough im sure, K was throwing out circuit boards like they was trash because they had no purpose, then all the sudden they needed em lol
[6:13:56] drewdeezy21: its weird cause you have to do a job just to use the truck
[6:14:09] Gh0stPog: try it
[6:14:14] Aeriial: u know some cops will look in it straight away
[6:14:21] CptSpaceBush: open your own delivery service? not using the truck
[6:14:23] Hey_its_Mady: Call chodie to test it in his pounder
[6:14:32] Lavitzboss: it lasting 48 hours sucks though, having to pay for a new one all the time
[6:14:33] ItsEdBoi_: car parts if ppl stock up, but so many crowbars now
[6:14:33] TheTacticalDonut: have you put anything in the box to see if it registers the same weight?
[6:15:00] RacefanRacing: you just need to do a run and test
[6:15:06] B0bbysmalls: place it in the truck hidden amungst other grim boxes
[6:15:11] elcozitto: timmacHANDS timmacHANDS timmacHANDS
[6:15:13] Splitcookie713: @aeriial Ramee has a case coming up about cops opening and reading a book. could set a precedent
[6:15:25] Lavitzboss: it costs like 300 for that? wouldnt lumber people rather just make multiple trips
[6:15:36] TheTacticalDonut: did you place anything in the box?

[6:15:42] Gh0stPog: i say try puttin in the truck if it works
[6:15:46] Lavitzboss: the cost and it only lasting 48 hours is very limiting
[6:15:49] YxtBomb: i mean it opens the door to logistics / trucking business
[6:15:49] TripleJAllDay: there has to be a benefit
[6:15:59] Lavitzboss: if it lasted for like 30 days
[6:15:59] Cruzier2012: try it
[6:16:14] Lavitzboss: Yup
[6:16:17] YxtBomb: yeahhh idk
[6:16:19] Gh0stPog: but thats a one time investment no ?
[6:16:19] ixbxkillabee: what if you could put weed in it and sell to the green haired guy
[6:16:21] MatterHatter1: and only for 2 days
[6:16:23] oofles_sadface: as well as truck repair costs, it really might not be worth it
[6:16:24] Lavitzboss: they rather make the trips themselves
[6:16:34] TheTacticalDonut: have you placed anything in it? does it register the same weight?
[6:16:37] B0bbysmalls: ya place it in the trunk like you did with the blueprints
[6:16:38] ItsEdBoi_: It like cool RP for smuggling but like just go in a car and dont get caught no point
[6:16:39] WhoNeedsBullets: if there is any foresight to it, there may be "illegal" truck runs using these boxes with weed in em or whatever
[6:16:48] RagRanger: sell blueprint then?
[6:16:52] jonny282: sure devs will make it usefull if its not now
[6:17:00] SwagAz: wea did u get the box for
[6:17:02] t_worK: I don't see a benefit, at least with the small. Not expecting anything crazy from the large
[6:17:03] SwagAz: from
[6:17:07] ryan__mize: just like anything stuff can always change so who knows
[6:17:10] ItsEdBoi_: wait till it works
[6:17:32] SwagAz: im thinkn u use it to put in peoples mailboxes lol
[6:17:34] ikampzz: U sell it u can always buy another
[6:17:38] Hey_its_Mady: Honestly the devs working on grime are in a different realm LUL LUL
[6:17:51] Datursa: Probably the only one with the rep, the house and the bench to even use the bp.
[6:18:04] Lavitzboss: boxes like that were useful when peoples pockets were very limited. but now with pockets and backpack

[6:18:12] Lavitzboss: people don't need slots, they are limited by weight
[6:18:22] notwowayzz: selling it rn is the smart play
[6:18:27] TheTacticalDonut: have we placed anything in the box to see if it registers the same weight? could still be weight reduction
[6:18:28] darkdemonwiz: all grime boxes weigh 50 on your runs, if the high weighs 50 but has a higher internal capacity there is value
[6:18:41] Splitcookie713: Useful for slots in barrels
[6:18:43] RagRanger: might require it to sell drugs in bulk
[6:18:47] WhoNeedsBullets: @Timmac idk if you ever checked this, but can you hook up a vpn to the tablet?
[6:19:10] Lavitzboss: yea I guess with the big one, maybe slot maxing with the barrel. thats the only use
[6:19:38] CptSpaceBush: could be wood crates at a higher level rep. and maybe if they are wood they are permanent
[6:19:43] ItsEdBoi_: @Splitcookie713 thats smart, but 48 hr makes it ass
[6:19:51] RyanTheeBook: they need to change the time to expire to uses per move/trip
[6:19:58] RyanTheeBook: have it sealed when its full and if you unseal it it counts as a use. you can only pick it up if it's sealed
[6:20:02] Lavitzboss: yup
[6:20:07] mainmandaryl: Still got that guys gpu
[6:20:10] Lavitzboss: They should make them last very long or forever atleast
[6:21:02] Lepaca: I love the janky walk when you hold a box
[6:21:08] RyanTheeBook: nah they need to degrade but not by time
[6:21:41] internalin: so useless
[6:21:42] ItsEdBoi_: Thats hilariously bad
[6:21:43] t_worK: wtf
[6:21:46] Null_Value: LuL
[6:21:50] Gh0stPog: gg's

[6:21:53] 3xevilx: lmaoooo actually useless KEKW
[6:21:56] RagRanger: looooooooooool
[6:22:04] keegznz: Wtf lol
[6:22:06] ItsEdBoi_: Large boxes have to have weight reduction or its so useless
[6:22:15] t_worK: Only use I see is mass moving brick weed or something
[6:22:15] Lavitzboss: yup sooo bad
[6:22:25] YxtBomb: it might be used for something thats not out yet too
[6:22:28] Lavitzboss: should last either forever or very long
[6:22:39] SmashedPumpkinG: there must be a reason why

[6:23:23] ItsEdBoi_: @onilaa4 Brand new, hence like with everything else new its garbage and bugged
[6:24:10] onilaa4: @itsedboi_  yeah true could be still bugged so might be fixed in a day or two hopefully
[6:24:25] 3xevilx: at least there's almost no one actively robbing grime now
[6:24:28] t_worK: May as well be a box of shit
[6:24:39] RagRanger: disappointed
[6:24:39] ItsEdBoi_: well the blueprint is def bugged, the small box seems to be working as intended
[6:24:53] Lavitzboss: Yea, its very confusing. I think they just wanted to add something more useful for people with Grime rep, but the idea wasn't fully thought out
[6:25:01] WhoNeedsBullets: i can't understand what they are trying to do with grime. it has been absolute shit for the past month
[6:25:16] YxtBomb: maybe the small box is bait for not true grimers to say "fuck it"
[6:25:19] janorama: They surely gotta do some changes to it soon, cause now it doesnt make sense
[6:25:26] Lavitzboss: yea its very confusing what they think it will be used for
[6:25:27] Beignis: some good ol prop rp
[6:25:33] YxtBomb: theres already a lot of slots
[6:25:36] Lavitzboss: its literally a patch for Tommy T KEKW
[6:25:39] t_worK: Weight of box and storage weight being the same is where it hurts most
[6:25:40] WhoNeedsBullets: you have a backpack. slots don't mean shit now
[6:25:43] Ziress: The Barrels in the house maybe ?
[6:25:43] YxtBomb: i could see if it was only like 2 or 3 rows of slots
[6:25:44] ItsEdBoi_: weed growing only thing i can think of, its like 4 slots per plant
[6:25:55] 3xevilx: having a bazillion mats in a house but then why have it degrade?!
[6:26:06] Lavitzboss: Tommy T was selling Mystery loot boxes, and you can't put random items in Snr Buns boxes
[6:26:07] Alltimescumbag: Maybe they do it to throw people off about bigger boxes?
[6:26:08] paul1972olly: food
[6:26:09] apaceboldface: could you put weed bag in it and try do a hand off? so it look like grime drop off and not drug deal?
[6:26:25] ItsEdBoi_: @YxtBomb still not even they have so many slots in their backpack already
[6:26:26] YxtBomb: the degrade mechanic makes me think its specifically bought for 1 purpose
[6:26:35] tboys3: @Timmac maybe you able to make it storage at house? on ground
[6:26:53] internalin: the big ones would need to be really useful for the price and degradation
[6:26:57] Sawoklato: can you dry weed faster in the box?
[6:27:06] tboys3: true
[6:27:10] WhoNeedsBullets: things are persistent in the world, you don't need storage. just a door to lock
[6:27:11] 3xevilx: doubt it
[6:27:18] RagRanger: boxes are amazing havent u seen that spongeBob episode
[6:27:23] t_worK: Probably has a use somewhere where the coding isn't there yet. The Fur on the Blueprint didn't even have an icon. Devs def high

[6:28:15] Splitcookie713: maybe there‚Äôs a cat you can give the box to LUL

[6:28:53] 3xevilx: final box just called the snoop dog LUL
[6:28:55] R3dl1nes: @TerrahAustralis wouldnt that be just called the 420 High AF :D
[6:28:58] cybigil: Maybe the devs will look at it and actually give it some value.
[6:29:04] Lavitzboss: kinda lame that the Packer isn't even worth getting
[6:29:14] enzo_921: timmacCIGRIP
[6:29:17] Gh0stPog: so the box is useless huh?
[6:29:26] YxtBomb: you would think there is a QA check before putting something in
[6:29:51] ItsEdBoi_: Box being useless is understandable, the blueprint not working is crazy not not test it once
[6:29:51] t_worK: But it just poofs in 48 hours
[6:29:52] Alltimescumbag: What if they did the little box on purpose to throw people off of the larger ones?
[6:30:02] Lavitzboss: and storage isn't as big as an issue with stuff lasting forever on the ground
[6:30:10] 3xevilx: he had issues before houses were a thing, not now
[6:30:11] Lavitzboss: like the blueprints in the house have been on the floor for days
[6:30:15] Lavitzboss: and they are still there
[6:30:17] darkdemonwiz: small box seems more like an rp item, larger boxes may offer weight reduction
[6:30:17] onilaa4: Are the costs the same from small to large?
[6:30:18] cybigil: True, but past history speaks volumes.  There have been a ton of poorly thought out shit that has been patched already.
[6:30:22] Splitcookie713: dex is probably a good person to ask
[6:30:30] ItsEdBoi_: wonder what happens if it goes bad with stuff inside
[6:30:33] R3dl1nes: well u have reported the bug issue it get fix SoonTM :D
[6:30:33] Gh0stPog: i think they made it for illegal grime transport but it s late game
[6:30:53] ahhjoshy: could be RP related maybe heist related like you have to deliver a bomb to the bank
