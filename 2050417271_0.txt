[1:04:27] 0ctember: they don't own it, the cars are parked on the sidewalk, that seems to be the thinking of jordan and his crew
[1:04:37] HyperGenics: If there's nothing in the state announcements or written down in law.... Jordan is 100% in the clear.

[1:38:43] Code_vx: LUL
[1:39:53] Pilatian: Jordan needs to know for research purposes
[1:40:51] poehoy: just pretend not to be drunk NODDERS
[1:40:52] aprilmoxt: I have questions? What are the legal limits
[1:41:25] Pilatian: Did Katya set any specific limits for DMV parking employment?
[1:42:01] Pilatian: KEKW
[1:42:54] Delnoir: Do we really WANT to be stuck in another bench trial from hell though? No charges is probably a blessing.
[1:42:56] rachelkachel: occamNote
[1:43:29] Pilatian: Nolan knows it's court week
[1:43:50] wellingtonsmom: They're going to end up in a bench trial at this rate at some point tonight. Might as well start it early.
[1:44:12] AskMeAboutL00M: lol

[1:44:40] HyperGenics: I cannot wait for tonight's 4 hour bench trial.
[1:44:40] mrsbee90: ok 2
[1:44:48] Rem753: minimum 3
[1:44:50] Delnoir: So lemme ask. The last two times Jordan has had bench trials they've been 4+ hours, and I know that there's been a couple of those that are NOT Jordan related. Do you think Bench Trials need to reign it in on their duration at all?
[1:45:12] mrsbee90: if it's longer than 2 hours I will go to bed like i did last night LUL
[1:45:22] awkward_penguinz: I think prosecutors and defenders need to get better at their jobs.
[1:45:41] Pilatian: Madge Do NOT object. Do NOT!
[1:45:44] awkward_penguinz: Fair enough.
[1:45:58] joseph28888: @mrsbee90 did you miss the last one lol i came in it was 2 someting am for me lol
[1:46:00] ragenbeast1: I'm ready to see Jordan try to take nolans car and Nolan just wips out the 45 and take out the engine
[1:46:09] Alterec: DA has to be one of the hardest things you can do in roleplay
[1:46:12] HyperGenics: Wait, they don't all have 20 years legal experience including trial experience???
[1:46:13] wellingtonsmom: I think you should be allowed to sleep during bench trials if they last over an hour and a half.
[1:46:13] IanthEdegen: From what I've seen the DOJ on ONX has been great.
[1:46:22] recklessgallifreyan: The words of Fingle Dan echo: Its not a real job Claire
[1:46:23] Lupanix: it all depends, I mean its a learning experience and fun for those directly involved, I watch someone RP as a cop for 8 hours
[1:46:29] Pilatian: "It's not a real job, Claire"
[1:46:34] mrsbee90: a lot of people forget that some of these people playing lawyers are IRL lawyers
[1:46:51] HyperGenics: Don't do traffic, you know what happens when you try and do traffic
[1:46:52] aprilmoxt: Also sometimes being bad is the point
[1:46:59] Delnoir: Don't need RP jobs becoming real jobs
[1:47:00] Fastburn_: Best cops can really hope out of trial with Jordan is to get the Greco act to have points to their licence
[1:47:14] Dustin2524: I dont want to watch fun. I want to watch people suffer
[1:47:18] MeggidoMuneblaze: I think we need a timer on screen: It has been X Minutes since the last Jordan Incident
[1:47:43] Pilatian: Someone should make a meme of that for the PD meeting
[1:47:58] mlangcs: Nolan has to bring it up at the meeting in the projector
[1:48:05] mlangcs: X minutes since the last jordan incident and bench trial
[1:48:51] aprilmoxt: Its been X minutes since Ive been on highway patrol because of Jordan
[1:49:13] MeggidoMuneblaze: its all just he said/she said
[1:49:34] Pilatian: Zoomed into the void
[1:49:42] poehoy: but you could force everyone into a multi hour long bench trial torture session which would be p. cool
[1:49:49] theconvictedquokka: Didn't Gemma kill jordan in 2.0
[1:49:51] joseph28888: zooming

[1:50:59] MeggidoMuneblaze: maybe once nixon is on duty you can tag team it, one person clocks the other is ready for the pursuit so they dont just take off into the atmosphere
[1:51:20] Razakka: Gemma was a good goon
[1:51:24] MeggidoMuneblaze: Thats what jordan needs, more psychopaths to kill for him
[1:51:39] Pilatian: The Goon Ranking
[1:51:43] ragenbeast1: Stab them then tow the car for being "abandoned"
[1:52:56] MeggidoMuneblaze: ooo is it time for another jordan scene already
[1:52:59] MeggidoMuneblaze: its been about 15 minutes
[1:53:23] Pilatian: "Is this a random gunshots call, or did Jordan commit 1st Degree Murder?"
[1:53:29] Pilatian: Oh my god it was Wrangler

[3:21:39] Deciousdark: Spelling is overrated anyway :)
[3:21:56] wellingtonsmom: What is that beep?
[3:24:28] wellingtonsmom: It sounds like a door opening on a home security system
[3:24:32] Delnoir: Once upon a time back in 3.0 I set up a speed trap as a cadet on Legion Square Patrol... got stabbed. Scruffy was not happy.
[3:24:49] MarchingBeast: lighthouse monkaS
[3:25:49] MarchingBeast: the street racers are all shift 1 unfortunately
[3:26:04] Delnoir: Oh it was good. It was Pride month and I set up behind one of the rainbows down the road from Pillbox facing the south side.
[3:26:19] Delnoir: Anyone who left Pillbox for the south side was a potential target.
[3:26:41] MarchingBeast: oh shit
[3:26:48] MarchingBeast: that poor ada
[3:28:14] MarchingBeast: yeah, that's A+
[3:28:24] wellingtonsmom: That can make such a difference in a court case.
[3:29:22] GxdzR6: jordan steele again
[3:29:35] Delnoir: Tasing out of vehicles is dodgy, but probably a necessary evil.
[3:30:01] Delnoir: Oh please tell me that's not...
[3:30:12] Delnoir: Goddammit.
[3:30:26] d0ubleDang: The tow trucks got a very flat front tire
[3:30:59] wellingtonsmom: Does Nolan have a silencer on his gun?
[3:31:29] Delnoir: That looked like a compensator.
[3:32:14] Wizzdumb: Nolan is legit the only cop that scares me lol
[3:32:48] TenderTeemo: oh god not another 8 hour court case
[3:32:56] TenderTeemo: LUL
[3:33:11] mercifullrs: Hell yeah another court case pentawHappy pentawHappy
[3:33:47] Delnoir: These four hour bench trials gotta stop. mbroSuffer
[3:34:02] HyperGenics: Here's our 4 hour bench trial
[3:34:04] MarchingBeast: connie is back!
[3:34:15] MarchingBeast: she's back from japan
[3:35:31] wellingtonsmom: The bunny did it!
[3:35:44] mercifullrs: It's coming right for you, shoot the bunny
[3:36:04] DeterNET: I can tell you from experience... BunBun's might be a little bit evil
[3:36:40] mercifullrs: @deternet Did you use the holy hand grenade?
[3:37:14] The_Herkin: @DeterNET Can confirm, first time BunBun met me, I was teleported into a void
[3:38:12] wellingtonsmom: You're supposed to meet an ADA. Ask him
[3:38:15] Pilatian: I can't believe Jerry did this.
[3:38:24] Spikee439: just run
[3:38:28] Miditron6000: 5 hour trial
[3:38:32] HyperGenics: 4 hour bench trial.... skip lol
[3:38:32] billsnation: pentawCodeBlue round 3
[3:38:33] fuze97: 5 hours bench trial for this?
[3:38:37] fuze97: :P
[3:38:40] DeterNET: @mercifullrs I don't have a holy hand granade in the city, BunBun would send the robots after us
[3:38:43] HyperGenics: Lots of witnesses to go through
[3:39:07] billsnation: this got potential to be longer than yesterday
[3:39:29] wellingtonsmom: @billsnation I think it's almost a guarantee to be longer
[3:39:40] Wolfstriker121: wtf
[3:39:40] billsnation: pentawJ
[3:39:54] Wizzdumb: That sounded so good
[3:39:59] Pilatian: The hare on the ground KEKW
[3:40:24] HyperGenics: Own or manage.
[3:40:28] Crosis86: they manage it kek
[3:40:37] Crosis86: oh god this is gonna be messy
[3:40:38] TenderTeemo: let's say he can't tow it, I don't think he can get shot tho
[3:40:40] nalec_: You can buy nuggets from clucking bell
[3:40:41] TerminatorTwo: It does
[3:40:43] Pilatian: Yeah, probably something the mayor has to sort out
[3:40:44] TerminatorTwo: Suck
[3:40:45] nalec_: Doesn't mean they own it
[3:40:47] VDOJunk: cant wait for court KEKW
[3:40:51] JetstarSolar: ya it all needs to be clarified ASAP
[3:41:16] Spikee439: well this need to happen
[3:41:32] wellingtonsmom: One way or another Jordan is going to make sure this gets clarified in the laws
[3:42:02] Crosis86: uhhhhh
[3:42:18] HyperGenics: That's reckless if I've ever heard of it
[3:42:32] Pilatian: POGGERS Court
[3:42:50] TenderTeemo: but didn't the guy who shot go down
[3:42:53] wellingtonsmom: Isn't it written in the Greco bylaws that they have to drop the car for at most $75 if the owner shows up and wants the car before it's in the impound?
[3:42:54] TenderTeemo: I'm so confused wtf happend LUL
[3:43:14] 0ctember: @wellingtonsmom that might not apply if they're actively being attacked
[3:43:15] Death_Prophet83: Oh boy, 3 hour bench trial coming 😣
[3:43:15] Pilatian: @TenderTeemo Jordan happened
[3:43:33] assassinm3: occams wants no part of this bench trial lol
[3:43:39] HyperGenics: Dip dip dip
[3:43:39] Death_Prophet83: Lol
[3:43:42] wellingtonsmom: @0ctember Yeah the punching changed my question, but I was typing it out before that was said lol
[3:43:45] TenderTeemo: so jordan got shot?
[3:43:47] OnyxSpartanII: even in Texas I don't think stand your ground covers a non-violent crime like illegal towing KEKW
[3:43:59] Wizzdumb: lol Sounds about right
[3:44:38] Pilatian: Even if he doesn't get charged, I wonder if they could sue Jordan for damages since it was an auction and he damaged the value. monkaHmm
[3:45:41] Spikee439: well another interesting case
[3:45:59] HyperGenics: If Jordan didn't do anything technically wrong, what would they sue him for. He was performing his duties lawfully.
[3:47:22] Pilatian: No booli attorney NOOO
[3:47:34] OnyxSpartanII: Madge
[3:47:37] Wizzdumb: lmao
[3:47:40] Pilatian: Madge Jerry!
[3:47:46] Wizzdumb: So he DOES do that lol
[3:47:57] Wizzdumb: He was doing that to us the other night I think
[3:48:02] Pilatian: I think it's other admins half the time just building up a reputation for Mantis LUL
[3:48:22] Wizzdumb: lol
[3:49:38] Wizzdumb: LOL
[3:49:59] Pilatian: Madge Damnit
[3:50:01] d0ubleDang: Farting is always funny
[3:50:03] mystic_drewman: Heavy water is for nukes lol
[3:50:30] Pilatian: My god, he referenced it
[3:55:12] wellingtonsmom: I really like that he's doing this
[4:18:32] wellingtonsmom: It would take you HOURS
[4:19:57] wellingtonsmom: Burton did one with 4 people and it took him over 6 hours. But maybe he was being super picky
[4:20:38] d0ubleDang: onx tow?
[4:21:02] Empirics_: Is it utility?
[4:22:02] bruhkewl: could get it from running a plate on one
[4:23:37] Nargil27: flatbed maybe?
[4:24:23] libylol123: devs deskchan
[4:25:19] d0ubleDang: rollback?
[4:26:05] Empirics_: I used to drive a towtruck and I have heard them called too many things to help
[4:26:19] d0ubleDang: lorry?
[4:26:30] Empirics_: Wrecker maybe?
[4:26:36] Mareik: maybe check the ones with ONX in front
[4:26:38] Empirics_: One of the more common
[4:26:47] LoneWolfRacing77: i thought i saw an onx option when you typed tow
[4:27:30] LoneWolfRacing77: okay
[4:28:53] Empirics_: Line truck, Recovery truck, winch truck, hauler, rollback, and wrecker like I said earlier just to name a few. Its needle in a haystack since you dont know who named it
[4:29:08] Empirics_: And if its a custom truck it could be anything
[4:30:30] beermami: can’t believe you wanted to eat deputy ripley
[4:31:50] d0ubleDang: that rabbit gets around
[4:32:04] aprilmoxt: Do It!
[4:32:19] beermami: smoked rabbit
[4:32:21] LoneWolfRacing77: yes
[4:34:26] Wolfstriker121: the bunny is the new chief of police ..Mr bun buns
[4:35:23] bruhkewl: needs a chief hat
[4:35:46] beermami: Deputy Ripley the rabbit runs pd and Julius Cheeser the rat is the governor
[4:39:31] beermami: just get a light bar like my truck lol
[4:39:55] DeterNET: i mean that... should be doable
[4:40:48] Empirics_: You could just use whatever system is in GTA for the cars with the turrets on top of them but apply it to a light...Im not a dev but it sounds doable
[4:41:18] beermami: did you get to be one of the animals today??
[4:41:49] Empirics_: Like an owl?
[4:41:56] beermami: omg there was like sooo many

[4:42:06] Caffine5: Is there a buffalo?

[4:42:55] Caffine5: Import from RDR2, haha
[4:43:11] LoneWolfRacing77: how about a crow?
[4:43:11] Caffine5: In fairness, there is a bigfoot and a teen wolf
[4:43:24] beermami: there’s a cow
[4:43:29] beermami: crow*
[4:43:29] poehoy: connie needs to learn a lesson Madge
[4:43:32] DeterNET: found a spotlight script but its 4 years old and looks to be c-sharp instead of lua, but it might still work
[4:43:48] LoneWolfRacing77: large crow with red eyes
[4:44:34] beermami: I haven’t done crow yet but rat has the hardest and most scuffed
[4:46:30] beermami: I know you did panther hahah
[4:47:10] beermami: ooooh I love those
[4:47:19] d0ubleDang: 92!
[4:47:25] beermami: mantis was it recently and I definitely didn’t shoot him
[4:48:50] d0ubleDang: looks like the van the injured red haired lady was driving earlier before she went to the hospital
[4:49:11] d0ubleDang: same woman
[4:53:09] rachelkachel: death penalty occamGun

[5:06:27] Thirdmango: it's also a good way to interact with players who might not be able to do much RP with cops
[5:06:32] Nycoleus: I love traffic stop RP, it's relaxing and leads to fun interactions
[5:07:18] rachelkachel: oop

[5:12:50] bruhkewl: the area seems more suited for a sprint
[5:13:02] Sykum: there are courses?

[5:14:05] Mobojo: And what was the name of that report again? Lol

[5:22:36] Delnoir: She ain't wearin' that right now.
