[1:07:02] mosstrr: Uncut Gems?
[1:07:04] gioimerla: Hello everyone
[1:07:06] blaze_playsgames: strange you can’t stream with the cam and record separately without, but I’m sure there is a reason for it
[1:07:09] Mr_Popilie: You like Blended?
[1:07:12] youshallloveeachother: Adam Sandler sounds VERY good in Spaceman
[1:07:15] SunshineNinja92: I was hesitant about his movie Leo on Netflix but I really enjoyed it
[1:07:19] esachs09: sub anniversary in 8 days!!!
[1:07:21] sniperdolphin47: How many kills has he saved so far this time around compared to 1.0?

[1:07:39] Jamiemccloy: 1
[1:07:44] mosstrr: true
[1:07:49] redpanda_011: hustle was a great movie tbf
[1:07:50] radnhir: it was interesting, as it wasnt really a comedy movie so seeing a usually 'funny' actor in a drama movie was exciting
[1:07:54] cold_play1278: First thing that comes in my mind when matto plays minor turbulence is him yelling: WHAT IS THIS SONG?! I'M DELETING THIS SONG!!
[1:07:57] slothehhh: absolutely
[1:07:57] Maxy_the_Cat: He can act, but I don't think he can write.
[1:08:02] joshuabzz: bing
[1:08:03] sniperdolphin47: Adam Sandler is a genuinely good actor that has absolutely no regard for the quality of his films as long as he has fun makign them.
[1:08:03] lb215: whats your favourite film?
[1:08:04] hatter4099: How long are you going to play gta6 for
[1:08:07] seekingtreasure: adam sandler: 7/10 dviperNotes
[1:08:07] PR311: Adam Sandler just made enough money. He mostly acts with his friends to have fun with them on set
[1:08:08] algorithmic_oddity: Depends on your predisposition. If you just need to let off steam, video games are fine. If you're disposed to addiction, not so much. Also not if you don't know how to enforce healthy boundaries, or struggle to communicate.
[1:08:10] Mr_Popilie: Its the directors fault
[1:08:11] glynicallysad: grown ups is a funny movie but probably a 5/10
[1:08:13] l_studios123: he’s really nice
[1:08:15] hellser23: do pasifist with chaos mode
[1:08:16] SunshineNinja92: @calzone2010 are you thinking of the Christmas/hannukah one 8 Crazy Nights?
[1:08:19] l4conja: Uncut Gems is amazing
[1:08:21] OstrichNipple: Adam Sandler is the definiton of a slightly above avarage actor
[1:08:26] youshallloveeachother: Leo was like the only recent animation that could pull off original "talking animals with children" movie
[1:08:29] blaze_playsgames: he’s made a lot of money, some good some bad, like most things in life haha
[1:08:32] slothehhh: happy gilmore was the film I used to watch if I was having a bad time
[1:08:35] Clarry2000: dviperLove dviperLove dviperLove dviperLove dviperLove dviperLove dviperLove
[1:08:38] mirzza96: The one with the remote control where he controls his life gave me existential crisis when I was 10
[1:08:39] ZkaroTV: he has good movies for sure, it's just that lately he has both directed and acted in are some absolute cash grabs that are like 60% improv
[1:08:42] larry_yes: Mike Meyers is the same way
[1:08:45] GGHerb: I like his personality just laid back
[1:08:46] GameRollGTA: jim carrey is an underrated comedy actor, his acting skill is underappreciated
[1:08:46] theboomingbombr: click
[1:08:49] xantaro2006: why no face cam?
[1:08:56] DPM_DRK: I can't get it into my brain that he is Zohan
[1:08:56] blaze_playsgames: we do not talk about click
[1:08:56] PR311: That's why his casts are mostly  filled with his friends and co comedy stars
[1:08:58] SunshineNinja92: I love Billy Madison haha
[1:09:00] lb215: agh vhs lol
[1:09:00] Maxy_the_Cat: Eight Crazy Nights is the worst Adam Sandler film I've seen.
[1:09:04] stevemiller22: Two 90s classics imo
[1:09:07] pedro1cy: Don't think I've watch anything if hos
[1:09:07] calzone2010: the way i see it he is just having fun on set
[1:09:17] seekingtreasure: spoilers dviperSad
[1:09:18] hellser23: @xantaro2006 !facecam
[1:09:18] Fossabot: @xantaro2006 Matt is recording additional footage for Pacifist% 2.0, hence the facecam is disabled.

[1:09:30] SunshineNinja92: @maxy_the_cat it is bad but it's a train wreck I can't help but watch
[1:09:33] youshallloveeachother: Happy Gilmore made me crazy about mini-golf
[1:09:33] vickmortem91: mr deeds is a great one, waterboy and big dadddy too
[1:09:33] glynicallysad: I cried at the end of Click 😭
[1:09:35] jamsian_: dviperSad
[1:09:38] Maxy_the_Cat: It's not an original concept btw. R.L Stine did it first.
[1:09:39] KennithSham: Hey matto hope stream is going well dviperWave
[1:09:44] radnhir: Whats your favorite movie of all time tho?
[1:09:45] blaze_playsgames: it’s a stolen concept

[1:19:11] bolbolsbowlingbol: can you do that with the other guy you needed to kill?

[1:43:44] KajabuzaTheOne: trevor spawned in backrooms

[1:48:40] tech__nauch: but ticktoc ins banned in our country
[1:48:41] seekingtreasure: @AtlasDevelopment ViperSweat
[1:48:44] th3_bacon: Kick won't die because it's not actually intended to make money, they use Amazon IVS which means they essentially license the Twitch back end for 10x the cost Twitch pays, it can never possibly make money
[1:48:49] algorithmic_oddity: @ultimate_edition2077 Just tried YT music. It stops Twitch too.
[1:48:50] sampievk: stream on vine

[1:49:01] taiwanssj4: is this that one mission?
[1:49:03] DPM_DRK: I think the problem with Kick it's basically Twitch with even more an dubious/morally questionable backing behind it.
[1:49:03] TrippyDogeyt: Yo
[1:49:06] walkytalkymann: Why is your cam turned off btw?
[1:49:07] jakobs_820: Do you recomend some psychology or philosophy books?

[1:49:28] fantasticfluffle: @walkytalkymann he’s doing pacifist content rn
[1:49:31] Bowzer619: Kick is basically Twitter after Elon
[1:49:36] g1steezy: @walkytalkymann read pinned comment

[1:50:43] algorithmic_oddity: Rumble invested too much in political content... Other genres do not want to be associated with that.

[1:56:25] fantasticfluffle: @tactu75 yeah dude, he did play cyberpunk 2077 once…
[1:56:26] algorithmic_oddity: @x6ur I think it must be difficult dating a content creator. Whenever they are upset (even if it is not about you), you'll likely have a mob of people demanding to know why you are not taking care of your (or rather their) man.
[1:56:31] cold_play1278: the final countdown

[2:08:43] tactu75: Would you ever do a coop speedrun?
[2:09:03] X6UR: So from what I understand, if you melee someone, it doesnt count as a kill or does it?
[2:09:31] DPM_DRK: Wouldn't some super well funded PMC have homing rockets instead of unguided missiles that will probably never hit considering the movement? And even if it's more cost effective, wouldn't it be worth more protecting the cargo?
[2:09:31] tactu75: What does resubing means chat?
[2:09:54] neonulled: can't you enable spooner mode with F9
[2:10:00] sanyochan: @tactu75 renewing your abonnement ^^
[2:10:01] tactu75: But how are you going to actually get them over there without mods?
[2:10:10] azzabirb: @X6UR It counts as what it is, a melee.

[2:10:28] Takkie79: Hell Yeah
[2:10:36] tactu75: How are you going to get him there without mods matto sorry for spam
[2:10:40] chrisssst1: @x6ur it does, basically if he can't avoid a kill he'll go for a melee, if he can't melee then he's gonna use a gun
