[1:16:15] fng78: CY TRUEING rn
[1:16:21] DarthRadonis: weird cause a lot of the newer Semi's IRL are automatic
[1:16:36] DarkSilentArrow: can you make it automatic or is it not possible?
[1:16:39] DarthRadonis: I know my brothers Gas tanker he drives for Sheetz is Auto
[1:16:44] EyeScraem: @DarkSilentArrow he can but costs 10k
[1:16:49] Blavod: yeah. maybe make it auto later
[1:16:58] xscoxevox: How much money octo got ?
[1:17:11] fng78: 69420k
[1:17:12] DarthRadonis: the sounds are really good for this game for the vehicles
[1:17:15] EyeScraem: this truck is WAYTOODANK
[1:17:23] EyeScraem: cant even hear the music
[1:17:37] iwr1techky12: the turbo whistle type sound is nuts
[1:17:42] DarthRadonis: It sounds so good
[1:17:42] Tur4no: That whine AAAA

[1:23:11] DarthRadonis: Hmmm
[1:23:17] Blavod: that seems like the best option to not make it a mess
[1:23:57] ketsu93: if it scuffs for Kitty, you can detach and attach it again and it fixes it
[1:24:04] shadow__fx: First person looks so cool
[1:24:06] DarkSilentArrow: is this thing sequential or do you have to use clutch?
[1:24:08] EyeScraem: yea if it blows up for her it blows you up pretty sure

[1:29:15] hc_fernando: Has he finally buy the packer?
[1:29:18] AlessT__: @AlessT__ oh ive never seen this one
[1:29:48] kazumadez: EZ
[1:29:48] ketsu93: @Ketel_One they cost 3k+, depends tho, since only mechanics can buy them, so ppl resell them for profit
[1:29:52] yomipad: this scuff lol
[1:30:06] miasarres: they should this scuff if they could kinda annoying
[1:30:10] ketsu93: @ketsu93 if you have a homie mechanic, under 4k
[1:30:10] EyeScraem: gotta be extra safe nodd
[1:30:12] Tur4no: frik that whine is killing me AAAA

[1:30:33] finnAndrei: lovely turbo whistle
[1:30:34] EyeScraem: all gas stations Kreygasm
[1:31:25] ketsu93: is it even worth to pull in here?
[1:32:12] iwr1techky12: I imagine that one has to be better. 3.3 is pretty much the lowest payout you can get
[1:32:19] DarthRadonis: Just like a real Semi
[1:32:46] finnAndrei: i used to do this for a living for 4 years lol, store and gas station deliveries with a rtrailer

[1:37:55] fearlesso1: its good
[1:38:01] hc_fernando: Sounds good so i dont mind
[1:38:01] DarkSilentArrow: @turismoking89 he did 1 run before and it paid 3.3k

[1:45:38] CYDERVERSE: locals classic
[1:45:41] nonimo777: For a moment I thought it was Dundee again
[1:46:45] iwr1techky12: there was one time where it looked like you completely jackknifed the trailer off the truck.
[1:46:50] Firepokachu: so on packer runs are there any contracts that pay more?
[1:46:56] iwr1techky12: other than that it was all fine the 1st run
[1:46:56] Fearr13ss: are you portuguese or just living in portugal? You don't have an accent at all
[1:46:59] Lloydcars: neutrenHi Everyone, How are we all tonight?
[1:47:03] Firepokachu: because if this pays the same as that gas station this one isn't worth
[1:47:08] CYDERVERSE: @Fearr13ss He is Portuguese, yes
[1:47:39] Fearr13ss: @Fearr13ss thanks, I could never guess based on how he speaks
[1:47:53] CYDERVERSE: He British
[1:48:09] fng78: British
[1:48:14] DarthRadonis: Hmmm
[1:48:21] Tur4no: He fancys tea ikitWut
[1:48:29] Fearr13ss: no british accent either
[1:48:33] woulf76: Is Brazilian Portuguese the same sound as Portugal Portuguese?
[1:48:50] OProta: @woulf76 nope
[1:48:59] StreetBull: @woulf76 not exactly, but close
[1:49:05] woulf76: Thanks
[1:49:27] Kazeumi: oh damn big runs?
[1:49:42] OProta: @woulf76 its like uk english and Usa english
[1:49:53] Perplexed_za: @woulf76 different dialect
[1:51:13] iwr1techky12: isn‚Äôt Kitty able to talk to him if you can‚Äôt?
[1:51:34] ketsu93: @iwr1techky12 sometimes both can't
[1:52:30] Sl33pyJinn: this song has some notes that reminds me of straub
[1:52:54] Sl33pyJinn: strobe*
[1:52:55] JaviSprays: heyyooo neutrenHi neutrenHeart
[1:52:59] DarthRadonis: Move over Local
[1:53:17] ketsu93: how much faster would a run with a fat turbo be Hmmm
[1:53:30] ahebbak: is this grime
[1:53:33] ketsu93: probably a decent bit
[1:53:37] DarthRadonis: grime yes
[1:53:38] Firepokachu: honestly a turbo might actually be worth on the packer
[1:53:41] hadid08: @ketsu93 5-10 mins faster prob
[1:53:59] secret_passengerr: a 90 turbo
[1:54:03] DarthRadonis: Turbo and Auto?
[1:54:10] iwr1techky12: this thing flies with a turbo
[1:54:16] iwr1techky12: it goes well over 100
[1:54:16] Kazeumi: 99mm turbo in this bigboy
[1:54:21] DarkSilentArrow: yeah cousins packer with turbo was doing like 110 top speed
[1:54:22] mokoto05: turbo meta LUL
[1:54:29] hadid08: no. with turbo this thing goes 110+
[1:54:35] jumpingdonuts: it probably is, was watching tony last night and cousin has one and the packer is flying at 100+
[1:54:36] hadid08: it huge diff no?
[1:54:59] Tur4no: Race with the packer with turbo KEK
[1:55:01] yomipad: isn't it a city race monkas
[1:55:12] ketsu93: which turbo is in stock today Hmmm
[1:55:13] iwr1techky12: you think it‚Äôs too easy with the comet?
[1:55:18] mokoto05: fast car = EZ money
[1:55:30] DarthRadonis: I expect a good race
[1:55:47] Kazeumi: vunNotes good race
[1:55:58] ketsu93: way more KEKW
[1:56:04] shadow__fx: We dont care if you win or not. Its just nice to see you drive with your skill
[1:56:04] Leowulf: how are the races now? i've only seen the first blacklist race where there was no in-game map and it was just imgur
[1:56:06] iwr1techky12: it just sucks that the penumbra is so bad. wish it was more in between.
[1:56:07] TurismoKing89: even if the turbo isnt a huge one on the truck I imagine it would improve job times
[1:56:16] Singham09: wouldnt the penumbra be terrible for city, thats a ducktona style car KEKW
[1:56:29] KumiXIV: last race was good battle with shadestep at the start
[1:57:04] mentakona: ask yuno to try the sultan out sometime (when he's borrowing it from Gloryon)
[1:57:32] mentakona: I imagine you can tell better from the driver's seat than watching someone else drive it
[1:57:40] mokoto05: turbo really make diff on everycar
[1:58:31] TurismoKing89: what was the Porsche from the stolen goods job that had the fast acceleration and decent handling? that would be a good city race car.
[1:58:37] DarthRadonis: I wonder if Zero will have a borrowed car tonight
[1:58:39] arctur_prime: this run will be under 1 hour
[1:58:46] iwr1techky12: that was the comet s2 and it isn‚Äôt for sale
[1:58:51] mokoto05: yep
[1:58:56] iwr1techky12: that thing is probably gonna cost a ton.
[1:59:00] KumiXIV: especially for all this highway driving
[1:59:01] Roe_the_Second: turbo packer pog
[1:59:11] mokoto05: @KumiXIV ^
[1:59:12] DarthRadonis: Pack the Turbo
[1:59:22] Nydels: 
[1:59:24] Tur4no: In the future are you going to get a meme car? Like a sleeper?
[1:59:30] Roe_the_Second: so how is the payout on these runs decent?/ better than g6
[2:00:15] DarthRadonis: Is it only cars can race or any vehicles?
[2:00:21] ketsu93: only 45 minutes so far, quick run
[2:00:40] mokoto05: imagine having a turbo it's more faster
[2:01:07] arctur_prime: wonder if there is a differencee if job is 1 hour+
[2:01:37] mokoto05: damn
[2:01:39] finnAndrei: thats my trucker
[2:01:42] finnAndrei: first try
[2:01:52] postse7en: ok i need kitty to park the next one
[2:02:09] tahoemac: hoow is the biger truck, this is the first run I've seen you do in it
[2:02:17] hadid08: @postse7en that would be o7
[2:02:38] Roe_the_Second: they need to get you guys a forklift for unloading need to demand that at the next contract negotiation
[2:02:43] Dzelle: Wait is this grime?
[2:03:00] iwr1techky12: probably best to have her try at the start of the job just Incase KEKW
[2:03:00] OmgSofie: Dzelle nodd tier 3 truck
[2:03:07] finnAndrei: next time do it through your eyes KEKW
[2:03:10] grett_dma: doggoArrive
[2:03:12] Dzelle: @omgsofie ohhh got it
[2:03:15] Firepokachu: I think the way Tony would park is probably the most efficient way to
[2:03:15] RamJamFingers: cant you use the g6 pallet strat here? one person puts it on the ground and the other one gives it to the guy?
[2:03:58] ketsu93: that sounds risky
[2:04:04] ketsu93: for little gain
[2:04:26] tahoemac: how much more cargo does this one hold over the smaller truck
[2:04:50] ketsu93: @tahoemac all 3 trucks have 5000 capacity KEKW
[2:04:56] tahoemac: what the hecvk
[2:05:02] KumiXIV: kinda weird its not more capacity LOL
[2:05:09] Roe_the_Second: real question is how is the pay difference over the pounder?
[2:05:10] ketsu93: all can fit 100 boxes KEK
[2:05:51] baalda: How long til we see Packer races with turbo
[2:05:53] tahoemac: i could see ther vna having a 3k kg limit the box truck having 13000kg and the big boy having 35000kg like they would irl
[2:06:08] mokoto05: packer race incoming LUL
[2:06:13] tahoemac: the box truck would probably have like a 10k kg limit
[2:06:16] fng78: CatCozy
[2:06:40] DarthRadonis: If the Packer had a much bigger load capacity it would take much longer to do runs and or might scuff at bigger loads
[2:06:43] OmgSofie: tony and cousin made huge monies neutrenMoney
[2:06:50] Roe_the_Second: about same time commitment per run?
[2:07:07] KumiXIV: its probably package rng too getting more 12 box contracts instead of 20s right
[2:07:07] iwr1techky12: it‚Äôs confirmed it can go well over 4K, the last run just must have been bad
[2:07:09] ketsu93: @DarthRadonis the boxes for it could just be heavier
[2:07:10] mokoto05: octo experimenting on every run neutrenMoney
[2:07:14] Firepokachu: it would‚Äôve been possible to get one more job in right if it was 12 so it could be even more pay
[2:07:30] mokoto05: probably
[2:07:32] DarthRadonis: I didnt see Tonys Packer runs
[2:07:36] OmgSofie: neutrenComfy guess you have to wait for tony to ask
[2:07:40] tahoemac: from what I understand cousin made 4.5k but it took almost 2hrs
[2:07:51] mokoto05: cousin probably have a strat
[2:07:56] ketsu93: probably how many jobs you fit in, you can fit 20x5 or 12x8
[2:07:58] iwr1techky12: the people who have had the packer for awhile would know.
[2:08:01] ketsu93: that's 3 more jobs
[2:08:01] Roe_the_Second: prolly a bit of both rng and figuring it out like you did for the pounder min max stuff
[2:08:15] mokoto05: ^
[2:08:16] jumpingdonuts: i think its RNG, that and cousin's packer had a turbo so was hitting 100+ any time it was on the highway
[2:08:17] Firepokachu: time to vod review and see how many contracts they did
[2:08:19] unbairu: I think you can choose the contracts that will fill to the fullest, I think they got 3.6, 4 and 4.6 runs that I saw. Cousin also had a turbo installed, so more time-effective.
[2:08:24] hadid08: its contract based. more contract more money
[2:08:50] ketsu93: 8 yea
[2:09:14] unbairu: What happens when the boxes do not fit?
[2:09:23] misfit_justice: are the weight values reflected on the contracts accurate though?
[2:09:25] ketsu93: @unbairu rip whole run
[2:09:25] Firepokachu: I guess you could see the weight of the next contract and then accept it if it can fit
[2:09:50] Roe_the_Second: that little drift there makes me want to see a blacklist race with all work trucks
[2:09:56] ketsu93: @Firepokachu if the weight shows up correctly KEK
[2:09:57] Tur4no: Can't you carry one of the big grime boxes to pack more jobs?

[2:42:27] goju_pampin: lockpicking is not good?
[2:42:28] Firepokachu: even then the crew will most likely get a getaway car
[2:42:36] tahoemac: in b4 lang is getting ready to murder you over kitty spending her money
[2:42:44] tahoemac: sorry
[2:42:50] hector2597: gang should put some money in because its to get them away no?
[2:42:52] jumpingdonuts: you should tho, since if its the getaway car the gang will use it a lot

[2:43:38] Firepokachu: i mean you did buy a car the car is just the packer
[2:43:39] goldencate: whats yours is mine and whats mine is mine
[2:43:43] Roe_the_Second: that was a wild and weird argument about you buying cars coming from the bois
[2:43:46] sarahm9889: it doesn't really matter
[2:43:50] sarahm9889: you paid off your debt

[2:44:14] DarthRadonis: Its all Gucci now
[2:44:20] tahoemac: i fel like the debt only materialized after they found out you bought the supra
[2:44:37] mokoto05: octo comeback time
[2:44:38] hector2597: i dont think they would have a problem since harry has seen how much you get chased
[2:44:39] ketsu93: I think chat is just saying that the gang should pay for the getaway car used in gang heists
[2:44:49] Blavod: the debt was always there but tony never told octo so yeah
[2:45:03] Roe_the_Second: on the topic of cars do you what are your thoughts on if nopixel would do a straight racing server?
[2:45:07] DarthRadonis: just gotta speak up about that kind of stuff
[2:45:25] Roe_the_Second: cause I keep hearing that rumor floated around
[2:45:31] mornelithevt: @Blavod They never made it that urgent to Tony either, to be fair.  Remember this whole thing sprang up when Tony was out of the city anyway
[2:45:37] bbcherry24: @darthradonis what do you mean he did speak up once he found out about it
[2:45:41] Singham09: @ketsu93 yeah, but this car definitely isnt for that KEKW
[2:45:43] Blavod: @mornelithevt YEP
[2:45:45] hector2597: not only heist just for him to do chopping he neds a car thats good enough to get away
[2:45:46] tahoemac: chat pork adobada or asada quesadilla?
[2:45:49] iLLuSi0NN: Damn i didnt get a notif Ur live
[2:45:58] OmgSofie: Thats actually valid, if they expect octo to get them out of heat with a fast car each time, they should use monies for that
[2:46:18] DarthRadonis: @bbcherry24 I mean about the rescues and the getaway stuff gotta speak up at the meeting for getting some kickback for it
[2:46:18] sarahm9889: i think they will keep restocking
[2:46:23] hector2597: its a good 4 door
[2:46:29] hector2597: 4sure
[2:46:50] tahoemac: needs to start charing for all the ubers to saftey for teh boys
[2:46:59] ty_136: im sure they have plans to fund a company getaway car
[2:47:04] bbcherry24: @darthradonis why would he expect a kickback for helping his group members ‚ùì
[2:47:06] goju_pampin: how's the packer doing, pays good?
[2:47:09] Roe_the_Second: it is cool as that gigi already has the bones of the kickbacks figured out and now just wants a week of data collection and tweaks before automating the kick backs
[2:47:12] anakinnotthekids: What car?

[2:47:48] iLLuSi0NN: This truck needs a turbo
[2:48:37] DarthRadonis: @bbcherry24 if its for the group and having to buy a getaway car for heists and stuff shouldnt part of come out of house funds?

[5:43:59] yattyz: @billyb00n GTA V is weird, he caps at 60 cause it made stuff more equal/fair on PH (Project homecoming) more FPS = more speed funny enough if i remebmer corectly
[5:44:03] colonelsanders460: Nostro did you get some rest btw?
[5:44:22] Jack_O_Lantern9: unless they are racing or escaping cops, why take the turbo out of your work vehicle (I.e you make money slower)

[5:45:37] Jack_O_Lantern9: which would payback his loan. They are then gonna pay back the 20k loan, cause the guy need to money soon for a car.
