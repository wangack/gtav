[3:21:31] bimotaracer: or 180
[3:21:52] Rahjoth: @bimotaracer it changes the volume of participants, and no one wants to deal with "odd" numbers like that. Also, crystNoU
[3:22:01] bimotaracer: ok got you.
[3:22:12] bimotaracer: you are the boss.
[3:22:13] bubbaduva: is brekkers still around or did he go to bed?
[3:22:54] Rahjoth: @bimotaracer There was a Valentine's event at a club yesterday with $800 entry fee... crystMonka
[3:23:10] bimotaracer: holy moly. wow. i get you rahjoth
[3:23:16] bimotaracer: i am just a viewer. i dont know all
[3:23:22] Rahjoth: Marked difference in volume, but each person who attends brings $800, so they made out.
[3:23:24] bimotaracer: i am new and i am still learning
[3:23:47] Rahjoth: Oh me too. It's more of a business thing. The higher your price, the less you can expect will come, but you'll need less to make the same margin.
[3:24:03] Rahjoth: It also shows your event has value to it.
[3:24:07] lollygagger808: nobody wants poor people at there event. lol
[3:24:14] bimotaracer: i have a little question. which version of gta V do i have to buy so i can come on this server and its running? i have a pc.
[3:24:14] Rahjoth: @lollygagger808 crystLUL

[3:25:32] Rahjoth: @bimotaracer Look up GTA V RP servers. I think most of them use the FiveM clients, but others might use something else. This server is No Pixel. You'll have to check their GTA V RP server site for details.
[3:26:05] Rahjoth: @bimotaracer Look up GTA V RP servers. I think most of them use the FiveM client, but others might use something else. This server is No Pixel. You'll have to check their GTA V RP server site for details.
[3:26:31] Rahjoth: Or make a post on Crystal's Discord. I am sure someone can walk you through it. This is a tight space to try and explain it.
[3:27:25] bimotaracer: thanks rahjoth

[3:28:01] ChillR2: !server
[3:28:01] Nightbot: Crystal is playing on a heavily modified private roleplaying server for GTA5 on PC. The whitelisted server is called NoPixel, using the FiveM client. You can find out more at fivem.net and nopixel.net Please note that only donation applications are open, this does not guarantee acceptance.
[3:28:17] ChillR2: there you go nodd
[3:28:30] bimotaracer: i am not sure rahjoth what i need to buy on steam.
[3:28:48] bimotaracer: or if there is a monthly fee on the server?
[3:29:28] Rahjoth: GTA V. You at least need to support the server to be able to apply, and you can only apply once per month ( I think ), so there might be a recurring cost til then
[3:29:50] Rahjoth: If I read their stuff correctly. I could be wrong on that.
[3:31:00] bimotaracer: thanks rahjoth so much.

[3:49:05] bimotaracer: i just read a tutorial. about becoming a member on a server.
[3:49:37] bimotaracer: ooc means out of context.
[3:50:47] bubbaduva: If you speak out of character it disrupts the flow of rp.
[3:52:28] bimotaracer: i understand it. bubbaduva. thank you so much. so you are not allowed to talk except inside your role. not of your real life. or can you talk on discord about real life stuff?
[3:53:07] bimotaracer: i heard about salt. do you talk with salt here too?
[3:54:20] bubbaduva: Well you can allude to real life instances, but indeed Los Santos is it's own ecosystem. An island, if you will.
[3:54:36] bimotaracer: i wonder how i can install twitch  with gta V. i think i need help anyway.
[3:54:45] bimotaracer: i am not a expert of twitch.
[3:55:11] hachiagejo: i don't think you can install twitch with gta 5 @bimotaracer
[3:55:13] bubbaduva: Ah, like stream it?
[3:55:13] bimotaracer: i nstalled some streaming stuff already. but i never played a game on twitch live.
[3:55:34] hachiagejo: you can just use a streaming software like obs nodd

[3:59:37] bubbaduva: Rest and relaxation is afforded you after the big scuff heist yesterday
[3:59:59] hachiagejo: they went back to the text-based application since the start of 4.0., so i don't think you need an interview? @bimotaracer

[4:27:24] bimotaracer: you dont wanna know how they fermentated the juice.
[4:27:28] bimotaracer: wanna hear it?
[4:27:33] bimotaracer: have a seat first
[4:27:44] Rahjoth: Knappogue 12-year is a single malt Irish whiskey aged 12 ears. They have it in 16 and 18 years, as well. They started when they found aged whiskey in Knappogue castle, hence the name. I liked it neat, AKA no ice. So good.
[4:27:46] qwuiky: was it thru a poo process like the cat coffee?
[4:28:10] bimotaracer: they filled the juice into a bottle and then spitted into the fresh juice.
[4:28:20] bimotaracer: and put the bottles in the sun.
[4:28:25] qwuiky: ew, hope it was clean spit
[4:28:51] qwuiky: swan the lure crystTap
[4:29:04] qwuiky: crystHehe
[4:29:12] Rahjoth: crystEvil
[4:29:19] bimotaracer: after a cple of days the palmwine ws ready. but there were hundreds of ants inside that bottle too.
[4:29:39] qwuiky: mmm ants to add flavor yummy
[4:29:44] Crystalst: Subscribe to my Youtube! New videos on the way! https://youtube.com/crystalst
[4:29:48] qwuiky: lil extra texture too
[4:29:58] bimotaracer: so if you drank the fermnted palmwine you had to be careful that the non filtered liquid didnt enter with ants your mouth. hehe
[4:30:29] Rahjoth: Once I started having nice whiskeys and bourbon, I stopped caring about cocktails, to be honest.
[4:30:39] bimotaracer: was so much fun. if new tourists arrived they didnt know that there were hundreds of ants on the bottom of the bottle  at nighttime. was not well visible.
[4:30:49] Rahjoth: @Crystalst I just rolled out of my fatigue, so I can sit up again with everyone. crystHype
[4:31:03] Rahjoth: @ExtraLarios SECOND WIND BAYBEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
[4:31:33] qwuiky: in hs i only drank shots/hard alc cus accessibility but now ive become more beerish
[4:31:40] bimotaracer: so we had much fun giving the bottle around the circle and everybody drank out of the bottle. at the end it depended if the person knew that there were ants inside or not.
[4:31:59] bimotaracer: we had big laughs when the bottom of the bottle reached.
[4:32:07] bimotaracer: haha you can imagine
[4:32:17] qwuiky: couple ants in a bottle never hurt nobody fuck it KekL
[4:32:35] Rahjoth: Just a little extra protein. crystSmirk

[4:33:42] bimotaracer: africa is such a wonderful place to make holidays mostly in the desert.
[4:33:52] qwuiky: you seem like youve lived a wildly interesting life lol @bimotaracer
[4:34:10] bimotaracer: its feels so cold in the night even if it has 18 degree celcius feels like winter.
[4:34:11] Rahjoth: @Crystalst I don't know what you can have, but have you ever tried Liquid IV drink mixes? Between lots of water and those, I can get super hydrated, which usually helps me stay awake.
[4:34:26] Rahjoth: Lots of salt and potassium.
[4:34:28] bimotaracer: qwuiky i could write a book yup.
[4:34:49] bimotaracer: i loved to discover the world when it ws peaceful.

[4:35:52] bimotaracer: thy prepared a room for me.
[4:36:12] qwuiky: virgin mary bimo kek
[4:36:26] bimotaracer: but in africa in the desert you are never allowed to open your door you never know what is entering your room
[4:36:31] qwuiky: sire may i please have room with da horses?
[4:36:33] bimotaracer: even if it is hot inside.
[4:36:51] bimotaracer: scorpions and snakes and spiders are alive at nighttime.
[4:36:56] bimotaracer: haha
[4:37:06] bimotaracer: but i was never biten. i was carful
[4:37:24] qwuiky: had a friend who grew up in africa, the wildlife stories he had was wild, got stung by a huge wasp and got put in a 3 week long coma as a kid

[4:39:03] qwuiky: coyote peterson vibes
[4:39:04] bimotaracer: it was a worm that moved under my skin.
[4:39:44] bimotaracer: i had to cut the worm out with a   razorblade. i was told the worm would wander into the heart and damage the heart if i dont cut it out of my skin.
[4:39:49] bimotaracer: incredible experience
[4:40:05] qwuiky: crystHuh
[4:40:05] bimotaracer: inhospitals they use ice to stop the worm.
