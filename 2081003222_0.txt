[4:14:51] ScarletThePaladin: Micheal mruuCopium
[4:14:55] Ravidge: It's so weird that Malton hasn't talked to Jenny
[4:14:58] Chritters: If no one takes the audit results, how is it not a waste? KEKW
[4:14:59] minnmor: 50k tho...
[4:15:24] 0Laetitia0: and the lovesick
[4:15:28] ImMcGuirk: and the passive money as well
[4:15:36] Chritters: It was worth it to Jenny. But it wasn't worth the State paying for it.
[4:15:51] Bruvverbean: @Chritters NODDERS
[4:16:04] filipe_vasconcellos_: @Chritters  PepeLoser state
[4:16:17] Bruvverbean: 50k + lovesick EZ

[4:16:24] fixer_18: The chief of police barely had time to do anything. He was busy yesterday. Will have to see what he asks for today and tomorrow
[4:16:40] TumNarDok: assumptions
[4:16:57] fixer_18: Ooo
[4:17:07] wesfeye: Does Malton have your report?
[4:17:09] Rhizwynd: Wasn't Malton heading the Audit?
[4:17:18] lettison: sounds like the mayors problem then
[4:17:19] xCheekz: its cause they already knew the issues, the audit teams purpose was to determine if these issues were valid or not. At least that's what I got from it all.
[4:17:38] natikar: thanks Michael, thats reassuring LUL
[4:17:41] Chritters: @xCheekz How do they know that if they didn't read the report?
[4:17:44] krimbo87: self sustaining Pd is a gang
[4:17:54] krimbo87: why would pd obey to the state
[4:17:55] natikar: there wont be a PD left in 4 weeks
[4:18:00] Chezzerz93: Can you reach out to Beric to hand it over or are you just going to wait to see how long (if ever) they ask for it out of principle?
[4:18:07] xCheekz: fresh set of eyes with no bias
[4:18:41] Ravidge: That's a question for Malton
[4:18:52] lettison: thats a whole lot of not your problem
[4:18:52] krimbo87: Jenny is the only one who talked to Ruth
[4:18:55] xCheekz: I didnt mean to twist, sorry, was just saying thats what it seemed like to me
[4:19:00] Chritters: None of this sounds like Jenny's job, chat.
[4:19:16] TumNarDok: did jenny give the papers to Malton?
[4:19:32] Chritters: It's not her responsibility to circle back and make them take the audit report.
[4:20:13] minnmor: nikkisSip
[4:20:19] Bruvverbean: nikkisGiggle
[4:20:26] GrumpyMark01: All it does is vindicate Jenny’s decision to retire from PD
[4:20:38] Ravidge: I mean, I just liked the RP that you've now made your name known all the new cop names too, so the arrests later will be spicier
[4:20:57] Crazith: Lovesick got out at the right time I think
[4:21:00] Chezzerz93: What was it that Siobhan said she had 45+ pages of? Was that not the Audit?
[4:21:14] XxAntagon1stxX: it was the audit
[4:21:23] TumNarDok: siobhan had notes from the AMA
[4:21:25] Rhizwynd: 45 pages of transcription talking to 17 officers
[4:21:31] minnmor: trueee

[4:21:42] twoeuro: EMS going to have like a taxi meter in their ambulances KEKW
[4:21:46] minnmor: @bluewhatev she is the money person
[4:22:00] bluewhatev: True, but Etta is EMS
[4:22:02] Crazith: oh a taxi meter would be funny
[4:22:02] ScarletThePaladin: Yep Canter does her best to stay out of anything to do with EMS
[4:22:17] Bruvverbean: @bluewhatev that's not her role on the council
[4:22:41] bluewhatev: That doesn't prevent her from advocating for them.  Just like any other council member can advocate for any group.
[4:22:45] ScarletThePaladin: "Help EMS Ive been stabbed" "That will be 5k for transport or we can push you the front of the que for £10k"
[4:22:54] Chezzerz93: So is the Audit still split between the 4 auditors separate notes or has it been combined/condensed by anybody?
[4:23:35] Chritters: @Chezzerz93 No one has approached Jenny for her audit results at all beyond what was said in the meeting.
[4:24:04] stridro: wait if the state not paying or helping pd are they helping doctors if not where would the state money go?
[4:24:12] XxAntagon1stxX: it was 4 auditor and mayor ran his own
[4:24:19] Chezzerz93: So this was all basically like being given homework and then the teacher never asks for it LUL
[4:24:24] minnmor: oh like hunting ;D
[4:24:25] Doqx42: Would say as long as those audit report were delivered to Malton at that point it is between Max and Malton to deal with.

[7:27:23] nikolegrnd: ^
[7:27:23] 0Laetitia0: @nikolegrnd it's more that he doesn't care about the rubbish quality bottles going to the house for a week max, but then when he has the 120+ recipe it's all going to him KEKW
[7:27:24] Nightbot: ^^ What they said nikkisSmile

[7:45:11] natikar: sounds like we need to put trygg in ICU
[7:45:13] Chritters: All he does benefits the house.
[7:45:17] Bruvverbean: Michael, Jenny, Dahila, Mac, Manny are PERFECT.
[7:45:19] nyx_constellation: Manny just sometimes has an attitude problem
[7:45:23] Dagarul: the entire thing was Billy holding the wood stuff at ransom
[7:45:23] colacubes1: manny had to be forced to take money for himself lol
[7:45:40] natikar: it really does sound like a billy issue
[7:45:50] 0Laetitia0: and none of you saw anny benefit from it

[7:48:02] 0Laetitia0: while you may have no spoons left and are tired, your reaction is not too much nikkisShrug
[7:48:26] minnmor: i didnt understand his break down
[7:48:32] nyx_constellation: But he is putting the house in danger by storing it there
[7:48:40] colacubes1: true
[7:48:58] erinord: You can make a lot only if you do everything yourself, if you have a runner you're cutting that at least in half
[7:49:16] wesfeye: its just the same as if you get moonshine from Reed for the house
[7:49:24] GrumpyMark01: If Billy cleans his own moonshine money and doesn’t contribute , he should store it somewhere else
[7:49:35] ZalenaStar: an extra body for heists thats it
[7:49:38] minnmor: and then he said that its not safe to run the money that it should be done in groups..
[7:49:41] nyx_constellation: He also seems to assume that heists make money
[7:49:42] Ravidge: People are more receptive in personal 1-on-1 talks compared to group circle talks
[7:49:58] MsAutumnWind: heres the solution: Billy can go live under the bridge and do the entire moonshine process himself with NO help and get 100%, problem solved
[7:50:03] Dagarul: you were being fair.. just 1 house member is the issue.. so its just a simple solution.. he can go abck to reggie?
[7:50:04] colacubes1: just take your gpus and run lol
[7:50:25] J4mb1t0: hahhaa
[7:50:28] Bruvverbean: please do it

[7:50:55] colacubes1: yeah manny dahlia, mac, Michael and Jenny just leave lol
[7:51:01] J4mb1t0: michael wants to move out asap, just jenny and him for mental health purpose nikkisGiggle
[7:51:27] nyx_constellation: It would be easier to buy the house from v and nick
[7:51:33] wesfeye: @colacubes1 at that point its better to just buyout V and Nick and yoink billys keys
[7:51:43] stridro: KEKW
[7:51:45] natikar: Just buy everyone out 4Head
[7:51:59] colacubes1: I think billy needs to be given some hard truths
[7:52:13] erinord: He says that, but then he's gonna want Mac, and Dahlia, and with Dahlia comes Manny, so at that point you may as well just stay and send Billy to Reggie
[7:52:27] ImMcGuirk: i blame the swedes
[7:52:34] Bruvverbean: Might aswell buyout everyone but Dahila and Manny from the house imo
[7:52:36] peter9517: yea good thing , he never cares

[9:01:42] nikolegrnd: sad that people forget to give them
[9:01:51] 0Laetitia0: Jason could be Charon, the "boat guy"
[9:01:52] nyx_constellation: Helios is God of sun, oaths and he flies the sun chariot
[9:02:04] Chritters: Morpheus is dreams. Kratos is strength.

[9:04:56] Bruvverbean: I zoned out, looking at greek gods nikkisGiggle
[9:05:03] 0Laetitia0: I have the perfect one for Reed: Pan, god of nature, with goat legs and horns, and quite the lewd character KEKW
[9:05:05] nyx_constellation: Billy as Hephaestus makes sense, he builds things, he also has a big grudge nikkisGiggle
[9:05:16] filipe_vasconcellos_: @0Laetitia0  OMEGALUL

[9:11:39] 0Laetitia0: I mean, apart from the virginity, it fits
[9:12:12] nyx_constellation: @0laetitia0 I was thinking about that as well! But that was the reason I didn't bring it ip
[9:12:12] 0Laetitia0: @minnmor Minnmor, April is a woman, her clothes DON'T have pockets nikkisStare
