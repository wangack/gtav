[4:20:23] vegasbrent: Feel really bad for Charlotte because it seems like all the stuff that she was worried about
[4:20:24] Insaif: If they want to play at being EMS, they need to commit to the bit.

[7:19:29] AshuraX13: 20
[7:19:31] Siirika: 12 or 20 with DnD
[7:19:41] Insaif: 20 is pretty solid based on what they're talking about.
[7:19:47] Larkonus: Level 20 is when you're practically a demigod.
[7:19:49] warmachine89: Depends on the game. 90 in you're wanting Final Fantasy. 20 for D&D.
[7:19:55] hecktobreakfast: yeah. and they could multi class into paladin
[7:19:58] doc_sharon: katesPosh

[8:03:19] IchibaToll: I know no meta on this, but I'm curious about what info the cops have.  One or two particular things come to mind.
[8:03:52] MyNameisTiff_: This might be the first time the last text message saving thing has been useful.
[8:03:53] Insaif: Man's gonna be worried sick when he wakes up next. katesGiggles

[8:04:10] Lerpukka: I guess Nick's day off curse is a thing in 4.0 too then KEKW
[8:04:12] IchibaToll: Oh, that hadn't even crossed my mind, but that would be spicy.
[8:04:25] miliitrcz: @Lerpukka oh no nikezStop
[8:04:41] venkaramon: Is it possible to rob houses without keys nkw?
[8:04:54] rekadsli: im surprised reggie isnt up hes useually my daytime streamer
[8:05:04] venkaramon: Was anything taken?
[8:05:17] abblepiewit: He was awake earlier but seemingly has gone back to sleep @rekadsli
[8:05:18] kangg: Reggie was awake earlier
[8:05:22] tyrannuswrecked: @venkaramon I heard robbing houses is currently against the rules, but I don’t know about the source
[8:05:22] doc_sharon: just watch the RP and see KEKW
[8:05:28] IchibaToll: The door was locked when Veronica tested, so hopefully it's all good.
[8:05:54] MaharajaTV: i think holding up someone to get there key at a house is not allowed
[8:06:16] GenuineMind: I mean, if it is Yager, great way for him to start a new war with the Simones in LIttle Sanguine
[8:06:18] tyrannuswrecked: @maharajatv that could also be true

[8:06:32] MaharajaTV: ahh oke
[8:06:35] venkaramon: That's not a good mechanic if it's only a B & E ping
[8:06:36] jedi_raccoon: just sittin in the rain
[8:07:00] LilMaGooby: That's still in place. It makes sense to RP this way though
[8:07:05] MaharajaTV: slacks be slacking
[8:07:05] AshuraX13: And it wasn't all the houses. It was specifically the Family's
[8:07:08] kangg: then today we see a ton of B&E pings so katesShrug
[8:07:14] Redeyes: Im wondering if Nikez was testing the ping or something
[8:07:15] GenuineMind: but if house keys are banned, does that mean there's a different way to break in?
[8:07:17] Insaif: We also have no idea what caused the ping. katesShrug
[8:07:29] doc_sharon: we only know what we know

[8:07:46] VTMonster: I bet it was those rodents that kidnapped scraps that time
[8:07:49] KarnEvil: with no cops responding to any of the pings, I'd put my money on devs cooking but not being finished.
