[6:22:43] Banaynay_: the "take a break" is the clock out, just worded that way, but gotta return the vehicle first, then talk to the npc
[6:23:00] TobeyTobes93: there should be a wheel UI to park it
[6:23:09] T_Smooth_: Maybe you don't get paid without the taxi permit idk

[6:23:56] S1Seven: you have to be clocked in to get the option to turn the van in
[6:23:57] affinityfriendlyartifacts: for me its always been thrid eye the side of vehicle to return them but since you clocked out before returning...  idk if that scuffed it
[6:24:10] affinityfriendlyartifacts: ive never drove taxi though
[6:24:13] BonafidepirateFPV: What if you rent another, then return them both while clocked in?
[6:24:14] RamserCx: "take a break" is prolly the clockout wording
[6:24:24] Gwnquinten: its clockout yea
[6:24:25] S1Seven: try clocking back in and see if you can return it
[6:24:31] Banaynay_: but i think you should get your hourly still, just can park it anywhere now or use it
[6:24:51] Banaynay_: works the same with tow and mechanic
[6:24:54] affinityfriendlyartifacts: can go to bank to see if got a check
[6:24:57] S1Seven: it'll give another but you can return both
[6:25:10] Gwnquinten: ^
[6:25:15] dr_b00ty: you have to turn  in the van before ending the job
[6:25:23] Gwnquinten: you will get a check at the bank for sure
[6:25:28] raven925: have to return before clocking out. if you try to clock in it wont let you, there is a time limit before clocking in again
[6:25:45] xxjustmarkxx: Re logging messes it up as well if that happened idk
