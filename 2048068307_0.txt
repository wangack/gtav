[3:43:31] killogic916: @mrbiggies the possible raid didnt have anything to do with Peanut
[3:43:33] MrYeOLDsNIPeR: yea, cleared because of the gun
[3:43:35] BanditWeazle: Does that mess with any of the houses for the mortgage company
[3:43:46] MrYeOLDsNIPeR: "the first gun" kekw
[3:44:05] RealDerped: Do you still play with any of the  peeps that use to play A3L?
[3:44:08] MrYeOLDsNIPeR: @Timmac how do you feel about there only being one owner of a house?
[3:44:24] RatBones69: Slacks would have to raid his own house then huh?
[3:44:28] itsmeebabes: it got cleared bc K got arrested for bs really but they ended up letting k go bc it was bs and they messed up
[3:45:04] itsmeebabes: ramee cleared it bc main allegation was K had a pd gun
[3:45:08] irishmf_24: If ramee is around get him to bring the racks back to the house üòÇ
[3:45:20] BanditWeazle: That's what I would flee that the people that shot me planning to gun
[3:45:43] itsmeebabes: yeah the pd messed up lol
[3:46:05] killogic916: @irishmf_24 Ramee dosnt have the racks, how is HE supposed to bring them bhack?
[3:46:30] MrYeOLDsNIPeR: wonder what chodie did after the house was cleared.

[3:47:12] itsmeebabes: ramee was held at knife point being escorted to a car and cops pulled up and saw it then let the other guys go and pulled guns on ramee, that‚Äôs why he was so heated lol
[3:47:37] Mordis_: The biggest wrnech in the whole thing is DNA. His DNA/Fingerprints will be on it as he pointed it Yeager so it will be on how "matter of fact" the PD/DoJ are going to be about DNA.
[3:48:17] killogic916: This DNA on items shit seems SUPER powerful
[3:48:23] killogic916: like OP as fuck
[3:48:30] irishmf_24: When you hand someone anything DNA is automatically on that object
[3:48:37] MrYeOLDsNIPeR: should be able to clean items of any fingerprints through some process
[3:48:43] RatBones69: DNA should only be used it big cases imo, if they start using it for small stuff it's gonna be weird
[3:48:59] SailorWS: i think it would be ok on some things. Ammo would be a good example
[3:49:17] DTNTBOMB: HE DID THAT TO CARMINE HE GAVE HIM A GUN TO GET HIS DNA
[3:49:21] JeremyMcKitten: it does seem a lil powerful
[3:49:25] DTNTBOMB: sorry all caps
[3:49:35] derprite: when u hand someone something it dont transfer the dna
[3:49:37] irishmf_24: The cops did really mess up with K though they let everyone go who shot but K was arrested üòÇ
[3:49:59] irishmf_24: He was  GSR negative
[3:50:14] fergy123: No the guy who shot was never spoken too
[3:50:14] killogic916: no
[3:50:14] Yzma1: Nah
[3:50:15] MrYeOLDsNIPeR: pretty sure noone shooting was gsr tested
[3:50:17] funnkinn: K didn't shoot
[3:50:18] RatBones69: k never shot
[3:50:21] irishmf_24: No he didn't
[3:50:22] alwaysthefriend_: There was 10 people that rolled them
[3:50:24] Mordis_: Just pointed
[3:50:26] Hey_its_Mady: K and ramee were GSR negative
[3:50:31] BreezyBri: Ramee and K didnt shoot, K got one tapped by a dude in Marys car
[3:50:34] truckinoff420: ya no the person that shot talked to the cops and they let hime drive away
[3:51:11] irishmf_24: Someone in there crew 911'd and the cops went for that cause they said in it K had a gun on him!!
[3:51:16] BreezyBri: they let 2 cars and a bike go and tried to arest Ramee and K who didnt shoot
[3:51:17] BanditWeazle: I didn't shoot myself

[3:52:02] drivebypanda: has he seen the wuchang basement yet?
[3:52:19] fergy123: No
[3:52:23] fergy123: they came to him first
[3:52:25] TheMonkSeal: he got rolled up on
[3:52:28] dadjustchillin: yes
[3:52:33] derprite: someone pulled out a wrench and then k pulled out gun on the guy
[3:52:35] BreezyBri: K held up Yeager who was on the phone
[3:52:37] killogic916: You are correct @Timmac
[3:52:45] killogic916: @Timmac HE ROLLED ON jAGER
[3:52:47] SailorWS: thats why like your RP, you can know a situation and remove it from your character
[3:52:48] DTNTBOMB: then they snitched
[3:52:48] truckinoff420: yager came to him and never listen to get into the car when k held him up
[3:52:52] Yzma1: thats true but guy didnt go inside his car right away
[3:52:55] BreezyBri: Yeager then told his crew to come over, they were around the corner
[3:52:56] fergy123: Yes but thye had stuff on K first
[3:52:59] TheMonkSeal: yeager rolled up on him with a crowbar k pulled a gun
[3:53:01] fergy123: then he held up Yeager
[3:53:07] truckinoff420: jager rooled up to k with a wrench out
[3:53:08] Yzma1: while he got gun pointed at him its so dumb
[3:53:08] irishmf_24: The fact K was GSR negative and they 911'd he had a gun they let them all go and they all just ran like lil dopes
[3:53:09] killogic916: @fergy123 wrong
[3:53:14] MrYeOLDsNIPeR: got rolled up on, k pulled his gun and told him to get in the car when jager was threatening with his wrench.
[3:53:15] DTNTBOMB: yeqa
[3:53:20] mr_danky: No
[3:53:35] TheMonkSeal: no yeaheg rolled up on him first cause k slow rolled by
[3:53:37] Fury_dr: I'm curious, if K had a gun on Yeager, then someone shoots K is that nvl or is that alright?
[3:53:39] fergy123: @killogic916 no its not? they had 2 bikes on him with Wrenches
[3:53:51] deathlover22: Yeager was on the phone when trying to roll up on K, K pulls the gun and says get in, few seconds go by then K gets HS from behind
[3:53:59] BreezyBri: Yeager rolled up on K with a crowbar, then K pulled the gun, Yeager thenb stayed on the phone after K told him to get off the phone and get in the car, Yeagers crew rolled up and shot K
[3:54:06] irishmf_24: His gun was fully loaded so that saved his ass
[3:54:07] garretth: They rolled up on him but he held them up then he got shot from a car that pulled up with 4 people bc the guy getting held up didnt get into the car quick he was taking his time @Timmac
[3:54:11] iTzMeegra: they even GSR tested K and he was negative
[3:54:13] killogic916: @fergy123 wrenches while you are in a car isnt being rolled up on... lol You just drive away.
[3:54:21] Azzarill: The cop no how meny guns are on the streets ?
[3:54:26] truckinoff420: they spotted people running in and out of the house when cops showed up
[3:54:27] TheMonkSeal: they only searched K because if the 911
[3:54:29] fergy123: @killogic916 obviously but that still happened
[3:54:45] daskaputtja: K was driving around. Yeager pulled on K, K pulled a gun and said get in the car. Yeager was on the radio or 911 and another 6 people rolled up and popped K in the back of the head.
[3:54:54] GamerGoat007: But that would mean cops would some type of investigation skills timmacHMM
[3:54:57] MrYeOLDsNIPeR: search a dead man because of a 911
[3:55:03] GamerGoat007: Have
[3:55:07] irishmf_24: Bruh that other cop who stopped the paramedic from treating K to frisk him was absolutely wild and then pulled him back out the ambulance to search him again
[3:55:10] MrYeOLDsNIPeR: lol, it was good RP though
[3:55:14] whistleytips: It wwas a rough situation tbh but good content
[3:55:28] TheMonkSeal: there are biases in work there
[3:55:29] sarapara22: ramee kept saying over and over gsr before cpr lol
[3:55:50] drivebypanda: just blame Vinny and go next LUL
[3:55:51] TheMonkSeal: everyon remembers criminal K
[3:56:01] whistleytips: GSR before CPR is wild

[3:57:01] RatBones69: anyhow K and Ramee got over it and kinda roasted Slacks during the Peanut situation so all good
[3:57:06] Lepaca: all this is petty, unnecessary beef
[3:57:06] fergy123: The Stabbing was clean ngl
[3:57:11] Azzarill: If ramee sees 2 of them going into a house do th cops have PC to enter the house ..
[3:57:12] Lepaca: so much at risk
[3:57:15] sym_biotic: does everyone in the cop force know Mr k? it‚Äôs an almost entirely new police force.
[3:57:24] pigscanflyhigh: @irishmf_24 I doubt it

[3:57:57] irishmf_24: @pigscanflyhigh he said last night hes going after them for revenge he isn't just gonna let rats get away with that shii üòÇüòÇ

[4:01:59] Lepaca: 10 already feels ancient for me, I love 11. no issues
[4:02:00] MrYeOLDsNIPeR: Are you responding to chat from 2 weeks ago with your win7?
[4:02:01] Head_Static: Me... and I refuse to update to 11
[4:02:18] BanditWeazle: Windows millennium
[4:02:23] trader455: @Head_Static no need to fix whats not broken
[4:02:24] RatBones69: I'll run 10 until they stop support next year
[4:02:27] Fatass_Drew: @Lepaca same, everytime i have to teamviewer into my buddies windows 10 it feels ancient
[4:02:31] Swalsugmass: My pc is a 2 years old and says its not compatible for the win11 update haha
[4:02:35] Rosco_RT: I have a windows xp box at work I keep locked up until I need it.
[4:02:46] VHD7: Tbh, im not a fan of the new ui look, but other than that I cant really hate it (been forced to on my work comp, so ive gotten used to it)
[4:02:46] Head_Static: @trader455 Exactly
[4:02:51] MrYeOLDsNIPeR: windows 11 is great
[4:02:53] Fatass_Drew: @Swalsugmass you have to enable tpm in bios in order to update to 11
[4:03:04] pigscanflyhigh: @irishmf_24 eventually for sure. might find some revenge before they squash it... it is not going to be a big gang gang thing imo.

[4:03:16] CrazyOpoLady: D:
[4:03:20] skaiixd: 7 was the last good OS. 10 was just fancy spyware and 11 is even worse
[4:03:27] MrYeOLDsNIPeR: all Vinny's fault, lol
[4:03:28] Swalsugmass: @Fatass_Drew im not fussed im good with 10
[4:03:29] Fatass_Drew: @Lepaca love nickelback, ill die on that hill
[4:03:36] Fatass_Drew: @Swalsugmass fair enough haha
[4:03:53] VHD7: @BMChills *can, not will. Its hardware dependent kinda, but also just remember to get rid of the bs Microsoft bloatware that gets put on by default
[4:04:07] Head_Static: I just don't like it. It messed my laptop up and became unfixable. Couldn't roll back to 10 after updating to 11... so I refuse to ever update to 11 on anything again. 10 works perfectly as is, no reason to update.
[4:04:09] Lepaca: @Fatass_Drew I dont "love" them, but they aint bad
[4:04:10] RatBones69: @skaiixd nah, you can shut down telemetry with a number of utilities if you want
[4:04:32] VHD7: True, the initial rollout of 11 was pretty rocky tbf
[4:04:35] Fatass_Drew: @Lepaca maybe love was strong, but they def get more hate than required
[4:04:42] skaiixd: @RatBones69 true, and I did. but like, why should i have to jump through tutorials to do that lmao
[4:04:51] Lepaca: @Fatass_Drew 100%

[5:22:15] FutileDiploma: haven‚Äôt seen OTT in a bit he still around
[5:22:25] halos420: yeah its just limiting is all.
[5:22:33] 8R00KS: Also he is down for the grind and enjoyable to drive with
[5:22:39] irishmf_24: Honestly OTT needs to put some money into section K first before he gets a percentage of it üòÇ
[5:23:00] DESHAWNTE: @irishmf_24 Lol

[5:23:01] killogic916: @killogic916 @halos420 but chop also makes you wait for it to wash and then also do the cleaning job. So it's less than 1/2 the money per time spent.
[5:23:02] FutileDiploma: how does halfsies work can you still run it at any time?
[5:23:03] 8R00KS: Hes said hes down but K hasnt asked OTT for money

[5:34:31] halos420: @pigscanflyhigh there was only the option to sell back to the state. there was no player to player sales. i guess they didnt want people buying houses as a way to safely hide money? no idea
[5:34:34] Jnaylor36: do you have to buy all the parts for a rack or is it already made?
[5:34:37] dasBeast77: You know what grinds my gears...
[5:34:39] zypher01: @pigscanflyhigh im guessing to incentivize selling to another player and not being able to buy and sell unwanted properties to make money

[5:40:15] tm_eng: Mid is the play if you spend time on the highway
[5:40:19] halos420: its a big heavy rig
[5:40:34] boss_waka: brake upgrade prob help that
[5:40:52] Lordbidwell: Yeah I would do a mid range turbo
[5:41:19] tm_eng: Also the gearing is short, so you spend enough time in the high range for a mid turbo to be useful
[5:41:24] halos420: i could see this being alot more enjoyable than the pounder just cause you gotta pay more attention
[5:41:32] boss_waka: its sick
[5:41:33] Jansbury: great for blocks
[5:41:33] Lordbidwell: She got the wrong turbo that's why killing her 1 2 3 gears
