[2:14:05] plutr0nium: That was the best way to explain it. He'd rather make zero money off you so he can reach quotas.
[2:14:06] turbodyrock: Kissahomie i cant be with you lang
[2:14:10] yellowtristan: @ishouldprobably it’s a good steady connection that is always profitable

[2:14:22] KaozVI: @ishouldprobably shes the reason the union was successful for weeks
[2:14:23] ksKaleido: @ishouldprobably hes looking at it long term, he thinks shes gonna be powerful down the road
[2:14:24] Nichols_C: @Moby1kanobee he was like 290 then the roof running thing came out and when he failed them it dropped sani by like 15 stars
[2:14:35] nissuJ: Lang lost like 10 stars doing roof running

[2:14:49] xMike6: yeah repair shops are fucked
[2:14:49] mCerti: Brown should become Patar 2.0 to piss off the chats
[2:14:51] lvlagg: @nissuj it was bugged first day, fixed now
[2:14:53] TheWitchAtWoolworths: @ishouldprobably It's because she buys for the the same price even when no one else is buying
[2:14:57] bobbls: yeah the demand is WAY higher
[2:14:58] yellowtristan: @ishouldprobably the electronics will die down eventually but Mary will always buy large orders of mats no matter what if that makes sense
[2:15:01] MADxBACKWARDS: I don't think he should burn bridges with mary though cause this boom wont last forever she constantly be making 40-50k orders
[2:15:02] bobbls: and its not speculative anymore
[2:15:05] Moby1kanobee: @Nichols_C Lang hit 290?
[2:15:06] MrFNZero: they're fucked
[2:15:16] martymagoo78: that allows you to buy everyone’s matts for 5 and flip for profit to lang
[2:15:26] KrisCat: @MADxBACKWARDS don't think he plans on burning bridges, just raising prices. it's up to her if she accepts.
[2:15:37] Nichols_C: @Moby1kanobee he was, now he back down from losing stars
[2:15:37] emiz0r: yee
[2:15:37] Nightbot: YEE YEE ROLL TIDE BROTHER! KKona
[2:15:45] Shadowx627: Until everybody has a gun blueprint people will grind money for circuit boards

[2:15:49] jambag00: You should've heard langs phone last night. Got asked for 100k circuit boards in 5 mins
[2:15:53] Moby1kanobee: @Nichols_C oh ok I thought he was barely past 250 thats great
[2:15:56] Volt0: wouldnt there be an end here too since people would learn what these contracts do and how much they cost/gain from them too
[2:15:57] ksKaleido: devs need to make car parts cheaper, its insane to pay 10% of the value of your car to fix it once
[2:15:58] PapaOD_: yep
[2:15:59] TastyKudzu: You guys should bring in Cloak to fund your server building.
[2:16:04] xTyeRee: Itll stay there until the heist payout dictates the price to change
[2:16:05] roesslerm: and the bois have to choose their own production too
[2:16:08] boobysmoke: mary just has to raise her prices for repairs and it works out but other shops gotta do the same
[2:16:12] HDrksBV: yupss, poor repair shop
[2:16:13] its_ajc: butcoin is the only time gated thing too, people will want circuit boards forever @Harry
[2:16:15] Wordbeast: yeah they;; have to increase prices
[2:16:17] OriginalGibsta: car repairs will spike
[2:16:20] eazypzz: more sani runners NotLikeThis
[2:16:23] emiz0r: gotta get their own crews, idk
[2:16:23] kiwie00: the guns alone will keep it high yea
[2:16:24] Nichols_C: @Moby1kanobee he grinds alot offline
[2:16:24] TastyKudzu: It's not only the heists but you have to assume the bigger heists will cost even more.
[2:16:24] yahmobethere: plus, as people get more money and then there are more cars, that demand will shoot up
[2:16:24] roesslerm: *juice (cooked af)
[2:16:25] Moby1kanobee: the heists have cool downs tho
[2:16:25] sirchardo: I feel like Lang keeps selling all these mats but you guys gotta juice up yourself
[2:16:25] TheWitchAtWoolworths: Yeah it's not gonna die down any time soon if you need buttcoin to open all these contracts and blueprints
[2:16:27] martymagoo78: you guys need to make sure you JUICE your own butcoin farm too, you need loads of circuit boards yourself
[2:16:29] Hudyn: repairs will become expensive as mats get expensive
[2:16:32] Moby1kanobee: @Nichols_C yea
[2:16:33] TheBrownStreak1: Mary is going to have to pay more for mats
[2:16:40] russevfx: Lang texting the exact same thing LOL
[2:16:42] OriginalGibsta: your 5k BJ repair will be 10k next week
[2:16:42] woolsCW: Better get your repairs now
[2:16:45] Nywro: Getting people set up for heists is nice but the main repair spot is also a big factor for the health.
[2:16:54] Moby1kanobee: @Harry heists having 2 week cooldowns will keep a lot of it in check
[2:16:59] PrivateSyaz: yeah crews are gonna send grinders down to farm mats + people will actually work if they get paid 6-8per
[2:17:00] KrisCat: LMAO
[2:17:00] TastyKudzu: Oh shit, you totally should repair all your cars tonight before prices spike.
[2:17:01] quadity2: I'm afraid all mats are gonna have to match circuit board prices. Which will cause massive inflation.
[2:17:05] yahmobethere: @sirchardo yeah im gonna laugh when the union people ask about getting a building thinking Lang was putting aside money from flipping
[2:17:05] legendhasit24: butcoin was just so much bigger than people thought too!
[2:17:07] Thatgooey: KEKW
[2:17:23] Z_people: economy is going up as its growing, not a bad thing
[2:17:28] TheWitchAtWoolworths: and folks are gonna want bulk
[2:17:29] mCerti: Doesnt Mary have heaps of cars to sell? I'm sure she is doing just fine KEKW
[2:17:30] its_ajc: lol.
[2:17:31] iiidaaah: I mean yeah, there is no way you guys can sell to her at 4 anymore, you are just screwing yourself for her benefit then
[2:17:33] Shadowx627: No matter what updates come to the server mats will always be highest priority

[2:17:41] xTyeRee: you know butcoin was X's idea, that X coin flopped hard KEKW
[2:17:45] TastyKudzu: @mCerti That's Mary personally. Not the mechanics at the shop.
[2:17:56] legendhasit24: chat, did we check our power usage yet?
[2:17:57] Moby1kanobee: if there was no 2 week cooldown on heists, then it would be way worse
[2:18:09] difficultsleep3r: Time to start robbing non union members again.
[2:18:11] OriginalGibsta: Mary is like one of the richest on the server she can fuck off NODDERS
[2:18:17] c000ls: LOL
[2:18:19] TastyKudzu: In a couple months the first of the graphics cards will be starting to fall apart too.
[2:18:21] mohawkdakidd: and Mary made a killing off you guys as well now it's time to get some money for the work
[2:18:31] martymagoo78: you guys are going to get left behind in coin production if not careful
[2:18:36] FacetiousChrist: yeah but after circuit boards something else will be needed to make weapons or c4 or whatever the fuck else comes along
[2:18:37] Jess17: 2 man actually slower no?
[2:18:39] its_ajc: eve Madge
[2:18:49] jambag00: Yo harry good morning
[2:18:52] its_ajc: @Jess17 a bit, but more mat split
[2:19:01] Hendrics: "oh noooo"
[2:19:06] Suleman_aftab: @mohawkdakidd she really didnt
[2:19:08] Jess17: truee
[2:19:09] spottease: spottease subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! ihateads
[2:19:13] lvlagg: @martymagoo78 ye well then crew should be contributing to that, it has only been lang pumping his own mats
[2:19:16] eazypzz: LOL
[2:19:19] Nichols_C: @its_ajc it can be just as fast they just have to have better spots where it works for 2 people
[2:19:20] FacetiousChrist: @tastykudzu oh that’s true people will have to make more
[2:19:20] Jess17: but not if harry harrRat
[2:19:21] eazypzz: burnt phone
[2:19:22] emiz0r: SMH
[2:19:33] bygoneflygon: eve SMH
[2:19:41] Moby1kanobee: I dont even think in 3 months CBs will cool off. The devs are going to be adding more and more so it never gets tale...mats will be hot as long as new things keep coming
[2:19:43] its_ajc: @Nichols_C yeah for sure, 2 man is way better IMO cause you just get way more mats quicker
[2:20:02] Hendrics: LUL lang is on one
[2:20:05] allknowing934: lang on one today hahaha
[2:20:05] its_ajc: SCHIZO LANG
[2:20:06] TastyKudzu: The one way it will cool off is if more efficient cards come out so you don't need as many.
[2:20:13] PapaOD_: bro lang was going crazy today
[2:20:13] pattaeto: CB RUSH CB RUSH
[2:20:14] elendil3791: Circuit Bois

[2:20:37] pattaeto: why does he have that saved up LMAO
[2:20:49] KingDekar: true
[2:20:52] iLLuSi0NN: 5 per at lest
[2:20:52] bygoneflygon: gun dealing back on the meny baby
[2:20:53] CourageTheCowardIy: most metal parts
[2:20:56] its_ajc: YEP
[2:20:57] CuttyNA: if mats ppl play this right they can raise the price of all mats because of this
[2:20:59] xRuntZzz: Harry sanithon LUL
[2:20:59] LuciferSpirt: u cant mass produce
[2:21:00] Popovzky: its the BuTc cost not guns
[2:21:06] kritacul: Yep
[2:21:09] ForgetMidnight: silencers, scopes, bigger guns o7 so many materials
[2:21:09] BrainsNSpaceBacon: boards for buttcoin
[2:21:10] omgfreecandy: furniture too
[2:21:10] joe_johnny: buddha im stream KEKW
[2:21:11] morgunz: Just stock pile bro don't sell
[2:21:12] swindel90: yeah no mass production
[2:21:14] martymagoo78: nah, that will be limited by gun parts which they will never mass release
[2:21:15] joe_johnny: in*
[2:21:16] Diggy_waffle: u cant mass produce the market will be bad
[2:21:19] ModernMilk: sell guns for 80k.
[2:21:24] DoogieHowserSpankedMySon: and the heists are on cooldown for 2 weeeks OMEGALUL
[2:21:27] lamby478: good tbh
[2:21:27] HDrksBV: yupsss
[2:21:28] lilqueso_: for a while they cant mass produce
[2:21:29] spottease: good
[2:21:29] wetterberg: circuit boards-> pcs -> butcoin -> heists... thats why that order is right now
[2:21:29] its_ajc: gonna be like 100k KEKW
[2:21:31] allknowing934: yeah the gun market gonna be bonkers for a month or two
[2:21:31] mCerti: Surely there will have to be another way to generate materials soon
[2:21:32] eazypzz: hype
[2:21:32] Dasan_i: good
[2:21:33] TastyKudzu: You can currently only craft 14 guns every 2 weeks for the whole server.
[2:21:34] Daywalkerblade: Who else can afford the 400+ Buttcoin to get the BP, Grinder, and Contract
[2:21:35] xMike6: lower than pd fines
[2:21:36] turbodyrock: thank fuck honestly
[2:21:37] BigBudB: need gunparts though so its still limited a lot by the jobs
[2:21:39] chaddarcheesely: Yeah you guys got some thinking to do!
[2:21:42] SekretAznMan: LULW
[2:21:43] omgfreecandy: KEKLEO
[2:21:43] ForgetMidnight: oop
[2:21:44] jsketchy01: 2 week cooldown is gonna cause so many tears LUL
[2:21:44] esp4ler: should be, none used gun, non pd issued
[2:21:45] mike9904_: It's like 60bc for 2 guns on top of the mats
[2:21:46] Moby1kanobee: until multiple people get the gun BP, then gun prices will cool way off
[2:21:46] its_ajc: thats good though, guns shouldnt be easy to get
[2:21:47] BaldScooter: plus the buttcoin to pay for the heist
[2:21:47] KrisCat: what are you doing, bummer LUL
[2:21:53] legendhasit24: I thought you guys were gonna be in the pool
[2:21:54] djerbis: 7 roberries * 2 guns = 14 guns per week for the whole server so i guess matts wont be the problem
[2:21:56] TheBrownStreak1: good thing. Streets won’t be flooded with guns
[2:22:04] Kurakita: It's like 50 butt coins for the heist which only gives you enough materials for 2 guns
[2:22:14] MrTribal: that different materail from heist, that hold people from mass production. guns  will be rare still
[2:22:16] BigBudB: its so cool
[2:22:18] omgfreecandy: NODDERS
[2:22:19] its_ajc: !devs
[2:22:19] Nightbot: The NoPixel devs have done an amazing job with 4.0, click on the link to see the list of current devs and go show them some love! harrL https://linktr.ee/nopixeldevs
[2:22:19] TastyKudzu: @djerbis per 2 weeks. The date was 14 days out. It rounded 1.99 weeks down to 1 on the contract.
[2:22:21] turbodyrock: YEP
[2:22:22] BrainsNSpaceBacon: harrNODDERS
[2:22:25] KrisCat: @djerbis every 2 weeks i think
[2:22:25] sanhobo_: i hope guns stay scarce/hard to source
[2:22:27] mike9904_: harrNODDERS
[2:22:28] BigBudB: not just 100 people with guns spamming holdups constantly too
[2:22:36] Thatgooey: Thatgooey subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:22:36] bygoneflygon: guns being really valuable is a good thing
[2:22:37] HDrksBV: yupsss, kinda like this phase
[2:22:38] ishouldprobably: I figure mats /mechanic dynamic will change once legit business licenses are assigned.
[2:22:42] Moby1kanobee: there will be a lot of guns soon
[2:22:43] Lutre: NODDERS lets the cops keep up without it becoming too much of an arms race
[2:22:44] Daywalkerblade: Well they only got 1 out of 6 crates... so could be 12 parts total
[2:22:45] ns0z: @djerbis You're assuming its 2 guns per job. No one knows if you can get more yet
[2:22:46] FacetiousChrist: @djerbis unless they didn’t do it correct and only got two parts for guns and maybe they could get 4-5 per run
[2:22:47] spudd710: stops the city being flooded for sure
[2:22:50] AnaklusmosDaze: @Kurakita it can potentially be more. one theory is if they let the timer go down they wouldve got more
[2:22:50] SWTurbo: And its not just one sourcce for guns
[2:22:51] TastyKudzu: Also gang wars will be much shorter because if you get gang related 5 times it's a HUT
[2:22:52] MrTribal: no mass productions NODDERS
[2:22:54] Superflissbro: Guns being rare is gonna be great for the server imo
[2:22:55] aery679: lang might need to pump up the prices because if more people pump up more coins, they can buy the bluprint
[2:22:59] CourageTheCowardIy: it also stops non stop robbery’s like 3.0 was where every bank goes off in the city
[2:22:59] KrisCat: yeah. helps to not overwhelm cops
[2:23:00] jsketchy01: people are gonna sell guns for an absurd price which is good too
[2:23:01] lamby478: harrNODDERS
[2:23:01] longinus098: 100%
[2:23:03] bobbls: if it wasnt gated it would happen so much that PD would know the meta instantly lmao
[2:23:05] eazypzz: yep
[2:23:06] CorporalPhoenix: chat i missed the start, did he see the power bill?
[2:23:08] iLLuSi0NN: Its very good. Devs can limit the amount of guns however they want now. Even better than with wl
[2:23:10] legendhasit24: I’m just curious to see how the cops play it with those crates all next to each other. especially the way they camp out hot areas
[2:23:12] punyh_: "there used to be gun what i could crap but someone lost it" KEKW
[2:23:13] Moby1kanobee: once 3 or 4 groups get the glock BP, its gonna be flowing pretty good
[2:23:16] its_ajc: @CorporalPhoenix yeah 19k
[2:23:18] xanpippin: greaaaaaat balance
[2:23:21] Thatgooey: NODDERS
[2:23:26] CorporalPhoenix: @its_ajc that's not bad.
[2:23:27] MrTribal: yea
[2:23:37] kritacul: @Moby1kanobee But they are still gonna need mats and parts.
[2:23:43] mike9904_: I think its 14 glocks every 2 weeks if you're lucky lol
[2:23:51] Lutre: @legendhasit24 probably will gradually escalate to shoot-outs if it gets hot enough
[2:24:06] Moby1kanobee: @kritacul yes right and the same thing will happen, they wil start to farm their own mats. WAY too many people will start doing sanitation...
[2:24:08] Thatgooey: glock a day is still pretty good to start
[2:24:09] Daywalkerblade: I think it could be up to 84 guns a week if you get all 6 crates each job
[2:24:10] PapaBeek: Wouldn't it be smarter move to try and slow down others and build up a huge but coin lead and gun supply before other have a chance?
[2:24:17] franciscooo25: is the main house in harrys name or was it transfered to gigi/cousin?
[2:24:18] Moby1kanobee: @kritacul which brings prices down
[2:24:19] potatowarrior411: there is probably a tipping point on prices to where people will pay vs kill and steal the materials too
[2:24:22] SWTurbo: Yuuuup
[2:24:24] LindsiyB: what's the cool down on the heists
[2:24:27] apache78: Yeah it'll be quiet for two weeks and then everyone is gonna spam all those contracts in 1 day. Lol
[2:24:28] Nywro: It could be up to 16 if the same group got it and each crate has 1 part giving 4 of 1 type per.
[2:24:31] kritacul: @kritacul Don't think so
[2:24:48] asddfdsadsfasf: people would stockpile them too
[2:24:54] jarbear77: What about ammo?\
[2:24:56] togusaa: mirror park house money
[2:25:02] zxJroc: guessing weapon tracing will be crazy too
[2:25:09] Daywalkerblade: Probably why they raised the fine on PD guns to 100k
[2:25:12] Thatgooey: ammo was in the contract description
[2:25:12] TastyKudzu: I mean guns should be even more because every gun is 25 butcoin before anything else.
[2:25:16] xanpippin: yup limited supply high demand
[2:25:16] legendhasit24: @lutre did you happen to see Tony interrogation today and what the cops had? trying to say that without saying anything Meta
[2:25:22] djerbis: @Moby1kanobee nah to my knowledge the roberies are limited, can do only 7 gun parts per server per 2 weeks (last i saw was 1 week, but chat saying its 2 weeks now)
[2:25:24] ModernMilk: Mechanic shops can raise their prices on repairs  cant they?
[2:25:24] jarbear77: @Thatgooey oh thanks
[2:25:26] Moby1kanobee: @kritacul same thing happened with GPUs...its simpmle economics
[2:25:33] martymagoo78: mechanic shops will just need to get their own teams to get matts
[2:25:44] kritacul: @kritacul And GPUs have gone back up
[2:25:44] elendil3791: Ez just open your own mechanic shop
[2:25:46] ishouldprobably: once the city is flooded with crafted guns months from now, I can see city council passing legislation to sell legal firearms as protection
[2:25:48] killa_karpenter: depending on how many people have the blueprint right??
[2:25:52] TastyKudzu: @djerbis the text said 1 week but it was rounding down the 1.999 weeks. It's 14 days.
[2:25:54] punyh_: Ye but the rarity of guns will bring more PD guns to the pool since people wanna steal them from the cops if they have time to after shoot outs
[2:25:57] Azure_96: Yeah, people would buy 30 brownings or whatever for 8k per OMEGALUL
[2:25:59] jsketchy01: the group was so locked in that the first run got the best “payout” I wonder if the next group will have to go through a two week trial and error period
[2:26:07] bigxfisch: thinking about how much money earthwell is making off you guys makes me sick
[2:26:08] xanpippin: hopefully they have decent decay to prevent the buildup over time
[2:26:10] papas_03: gotta charge more on mechanic shops now LUL LUL
[2:26:15] djerbis: @TastyKudzu oh i see, thanks
[2:26:22] DoogieHowserSpankedMySon: inflation needs to hit the repair shops maybe
[2:26:22] monroviabuttermilk: lol all the g6 workers who got expensive cars will now have to pay so much in repairs because their prices are def going up
[2:26:24] dizzydarko: @TastyKudzu i think its 1 week for city, 2 weeks for who did it last
[2:26:25] BiscuitKnight: I think they be able to craft attachments later.
[2:26:27] Lutre: @legendhasit24 yeah there's a lot of eyes on crims right now, and that's gonna cause things to escalate
[2:26:36] Moby1kanobee: @TastyKudzu i understand how it works I saw the next date avail
[2:26:38] TastyKudzu: @dizzydarko ooh maybe. I don't know about that.
[2:27:04] BurdenOrAGift: I think bringing the rust elements to GTA has worked out well. Like you have to grind and it's not easy
[2:27:10] legendhasit24: @lutre yeah! exactly! so those crates are gonna be hot! and if it’s a groups first time and they don’t have guns, it’s going to be interesting how it plays out
[2:27:13] fifthty: CBs?
[2:27:16] Daywalkerblade: Time to juice Mary up LUL
[2:27:17] dizzydarko: @TastyKudzu 2 separate timers imo, but who knows
[2:27:44] Daywalkerblade: That's probably gonna drive car parts up like crazy people are gonna mald LUL
[2:27:45] Thatgooey: you know what is going to be wild chat, is the point of view of whoever is nearby the first shootout and hears it go off
[2:27:45] martymagoo78: they will…. if not everyone will have 100 a day but coin farms and then they will be worthless. itll stop at some point
[2:27:48] jryan701: the cbs market might die but the other stuff for guns won’t
[2:27:53] brianm513: RIP Mojo Nixon
[2:28:01] Nywro: Cars are always going to be there.
[2:28:05] Rool_Gonzalez: Circus Boys
[2:28:08] Lutre: @legendhasit24 will likely be a case of people having to buy guns to get more guns
[2:28:09] baker8691: whats going on Harry and chat?
[2:28:21] kritacul: Mmhmm
[2:28:23] fifthty: truuu
[2:28:34] Moby1kanobee: there is going to be more and more and more stuff come out, RIFELS are coming out, AKs, who knows what other cool things that will come out...its not just glocks
[2:28:36] pattaeto: sadge for mary but it is what it is
[2:28:36] BiscuitKnight: did they get the electric bill today?
[2:28:37] TastyKudzu: The graphics cards decay and wear out. The first ones crafted will likely be dead before 3 months.
[2:28:38] Hack_Dog: gonna have to raise repair prices for those 150k cars
[2:28:38] legendhasit24: @lutre yeah, that makes sense! even better that the boys got it early then!
[2:28:43] bonewp: I THINK THE AMOUNT OF CBS PEOPLE IS TRYING TO GET RIGHT NOW IT IS GOING TO DIE CUZ EVERYONE IS GOING TO BE SELF SUFFISIENT with butcoin
[2:28:45] Azure_96: And your crew also needs to juice it too lmao
[2:28:45] Moby1kanobee: devs working hard, it will go way beyond 3 months
[2:28:48] KuonKhryseos: I think all the prices just going to go up. It's a result of the economy growing
[2:28:58] EhnOhSee: who is to say the later contracts wont be even more coin
[2:29:03] lunate87: It's the stock market, rise and fall
[2:29:07] kritacul: Think of all the Union people who have the stars to get the top mats. For people to try to catch up to that, will take a long time.
[2:29:09] Hack_Dog: ppl spending 100k+ on cars. They can afford a bump in repairs.
[2:29:14] punyh_: So every material cost the same? But CB's are more expensive than the others?
[2:29:37] Moby1kanobee: @punyh_ yeah because the current need for them to build GPUs is high again
[2:29:45] kritacul: @punyh_ They are the highest in demand
[2:29:47] TastyKudzu: @bonewp not if costs continue to rise. Whose to say the next heist isn't 100 BTC. Also, when there's a hard heist that takes 5-10 attempts to get the mechanics and hacks the groups doing those will need thousands.
[2:29:52] Nywro: Being the main supplier for a legit business plays well for converting to a business.
[2:29:58] Moby1kanobee: the 12 other groups that4 get back into sanitation to make money again
[2:30:01] ishouldprobably: EXACTLY MY POINT
[2:30:13] ishouldprobably: but everyone yelled at me ;(
[2:30:14] TastyKudzu: The only way the deal with Mary lasts is if she cuts you guys in on a percentage of her shop long term.
[2:30:19] jbbresh: Shruge leave the mechanic market with vinny being the last person
[2:30:19] Nichols_C: not wrong she will look for them herself and find out no one is selling and really have no choice to buy or run it herself(her crew)
[2:30:20] bappack: Its best to raise the prices, coz in the long term materials will be needed in the city and demand wont keep up
[2:30:21] Moby1kanobee: you forgot how many groups turned to sanitation the last time CBs went crazy
[2:30:21] N1ck9900: all this back and for just for brown to buy another car...
[2:30:39] MADxBACKWARDS: Just gotta ask for more from her
[2:30:41] franciscooo25: mary asks for bulk tho
[2:30:46] punyh_: Moby1kanobee kritacul but should all the materials price be increasing and not just CB's then? KEKW
[2:30:53] Suleman_aftab: but are the other repair shop willing to buy high amount of mats though
[2:30:53] bonewp: @bonewp but they already gonna a literally datacenter in their homes. I think people are gonan still buying but not at this amount because poeple are starting to realize that making raks and cpus is what they need for the future of their group
[2:30:57] Nywro: Mad Mary season KEKW
[2:31:04] Daywalkerblade: She ain't dumb, she knows how everyone needs CB's now
[2:31:07] ksKaleido: @franciscooo25 everyone does now, lang has ppl asking for 30k at a time all day now lol
[2:31:07] dizzydarko: CBs wont die, just slow down oncw ppl have a lot of racks
[2:31:12] Hudyn: which other repair shop KEKW vinny's shop barely buys mats
[2:31:13] mike9904_: Appreciate you reading these out im usually on mobile and can't see shit on the phone KEKW
[2:31:13] MADxBACKWARDS: Aint no one buying bulk like mary
[2:31:15] aery679: you can just ask a max bulk at w/e price and any extra would be market price
[2:31:18] stimboxer: She has always an option to match the new prices
[2:31:22] rem87062597: I think she sends mechanics out to do sani
[2:31:26] thequietgamer16: Just open your own rapier shop
[2:31:27] Suleman_aftab: shes the better business person to do business with
[2:31:28] franciscooo25: @franciscooo25 but thats for cbs not for the long term
[2:31:30] heysongr8: Ye it's a two way street, with the demand Mary can be forced to increase prices
[2:31:31] mCerti: plus has Brown profited really at all from the ongoing bulk deal with Mary?
[2:31:31] fifthty: CatBop CatBop
[2:31:33] sanhobo_: i wonder how many mechanic shops are still functioning now
[2:31:34] Shadowx627: Asking for bulk means nothing if you can get 7 for CB right now, thats almost double of whatever Mary wants on any given order
[2:31:37] jeffersonfarfan22: just tell her the truth.. people are paying stupid prices for cbs now.... pay that price or wait till it dies down
[2:31:38] Moby1kanobee: @punyh_ there will be many things that come out that will require new materials...that just means they pivot to that material since they can make whatever they want

[2:32:08] Moby1kanobee: if the BP does not poof
[2:32:09] TastyKudzu: It really seems like if Mary wants to rely on Lang for cheap mats (well below market price at this point) then the boys need some interest in the shop long term.

[2:33:44] rem87062597: I think a second mat source is going to come soon which wouldn't be the worst thing
[2:33:49] theSlinkyy: supply and demand baby EZ
[2:33:53] franciscooo25: if only a part of the mats were recylcables it would be healthier
[2:33:53] charzak: and with the new demand there is no where near enough mats to go around
[2:33:56] postAmongUsist: also who else is going to supply to her at 4 per when every1 is asking for CBs KEKW
[2:33:56] truckthunders: @wittycolt93 so all prior contracts are void?
[2:33:57] reichenbachs: being a mechanic shop owner isnt worth it imo.
[2:34:03] TastyKudzu: I worry about the crew falling behind selling all their CB.
[2:34:06] Moby1kanobee: @THEgoodCOW yeah but that does not matter just becasue one gun did ont effect it, that does not mean when a day passes it eats it up some, the devs coudl change it when too many guns get made...shit changes
[2:34:08] kritacul: Thought so too
[2:34:09] Nywro: Turned down for a business license and ends up only being able to sell to someone else that gets exclusive deal for it. LUL
[2:34:17] apache78: Yeah surprising no other mat source has shown up yet
[2:34:27] quadity2: Have you tried that again after storm? Since fence didn't work at first either
[2:34:37] Daywalkerblade: Maybe they increased that now? Have you tried putting car parts in lately?
[2:34:46] Lutre: would make sense as the whole reason those parts get stolen is for the precious metals
[2:34:50] apache78: They might now? No one has recycled those in a while
[2:34:51] TastyKudzu: @apache78 I hope they don't. G6 and Grime make bank. Sanitation people deserve to be paid.
[2:35:01] timesealer623: Maybe recycling doors also scales with rep?
[2:35:06] Thatgooey: it's more gems than chop per part, so if it gave mats i would assume it to be decent
[2:35:16] timesealer623: Chopping and sani rep?
[2:35:37] Thatgooey: yeah if you just need straight mats
[2:35:38] franciscooo25: But crims dont have rep, they cant use the grinder
[2:36:02] AU_Sunny: chop jobs also take so long to come in
[2:36:20] franciscooo25: Ohhh yes you are right
[2:36:21] jryan701: or a crim recycler in sewers
[2:36:22] Daywalkerblade: 140 recyclables x 8 is 1120 clean cash
[2:36:31] punyh_: Crims should have own "hidden" grinder KEKW

[2:37:08] Moby1kanobee: well 8-10
[2:37:13] its_ajc: it would kill civ jobs

[3:53:52] antipra: why dont u guys just move to the other house is so simple
[3:53:54] Ark789: Idk, the cost is permanently burning a connection with everyone in the crew, for like, 12 days of butcoin
[3:53:58] DrKamaKazii: I think you guys need a second bench for the Don house and just keep the gun stuff there
[3:54:01] Viper0922: bp is useless without butc farm tho
[3:54:01] BDubs7769: How many uses is the gun bp?

[3:54:30] c000ls: just expensive af
[3:54:34] Trishuli: Its 300 BUTC
[3:54:34] Jess17: you saw it today?
[3:54:34] 1TrueTyrant: the barrier of entry is pretty damn high tho
[3:54:34] M0MENT: yea but think about how few groups would every spend 300 on a bp
[3:54:35] SkyHawk0404: The 300 coin for it is
[3:54:37] DrKamaKazii: its a matter of can you afford it or not
[3:54:37] BurdenOrAGift: this guy is a yapper
[3:54:42] lunate87: @BDubs7769 its the parts thats the issue, since the jobs have a 2wk cd
[3:54:49] Ark789: It's hella expensive, but not "I stole your entire house" expensive
[3:54:55] DoogieHowserSpankedMySon: yea other people will have it end of next week

[3:55:36] djerbis: meh rn you dont need to use a gun anyway
[3:55:49] lunate87: @BDubs7769 oh and its like 50 butcoin per job KEKW thats why theres a rush for CB

[3:56:56] saidnaim5: that's really good then, one can set u up ! Plus, with that price it makes sense to last forever
[3:57:00] lunate87: @saidnaim5 i dont think they will change cause there is a soft lock since the jobs have cd
[3:57:29] dootadoo: Can't you just buy a new tool bench and put it in the new house. only the dons have keys to that one.
[3:57:46] truckthunders: @dootadoo that's what Harry wants
[3:57:48] antipra: i really doubt the gun bp will last forever unless u can't get much guns to craft
[3:58:10] QuackstheRubberDuck: @truckthunders that's 100% what's smart to do but rp wise ..
[3:58:13] charzak: @antipra the gun parts are the bottle neck for sure

[6:11:03] exo__23: @vrYasu nah
[6:11:04] Obsilia: @bonewp that still 300 btc xD
[6:11:16] Noordie: gun bp probably worth like 1,5mill
[6:11:17] xMike6: could be limited , like up to 10 or 5
[6:11:17] Volt0: and it's super expensive
[6:11:20] yubihunter: with 300 btc that no one has KEKW
[6:11:22] CyanMig: even if you value buttcoin at 1,000 each, that blueprints worth a fortune
[6:11:22] DrakeNightbane: 300 But is a huge sink too,
[6:11:25] drukkz: what if its gone after two or three purchases
[6:11:27] ophyce: @yahmobethere You can't buy them you need to get bp for ammo and mags on the drone app . it's expensive but less than the gun
[6:11:27] ishouldprobably: bp is 300 which equates to $300k
[6:11:28] Rool_Gonzalez: @jaemendo kept safe from chatters
[6:11:28] NoSpacesDan: @pg_tipss and those sports are just a game for entertainment, both things dont matter
[6:11:29] mortaldictata117: Even Gigi could yoink all yalls money but she ain't dumb
[6:11:30] etalag: the bp must have a limit bro

[6:12:15] iiidaaah: there is no way every person that reaches 300 coins is gona make their own guns. It has to be limited
[6:12:20] jumpingdonuts: @bonewp 300 btc is still a lot in the present and near future. as you have to remember contracts is another 50 btc and grinder is 10 btc
[6:12:22] GoutOfWar: damn brown got a weed empire EZ
[6:12:32] etalag: did harry check the drone app?

[6:12:58] yubihunter: they are stocked up on mags and ammo
[6:12:59] jumpingdonuts: xdd inb4 accidentally deletes room again
[6:13:00] bonewp: @bonewp yeah but 50c is 1 day or 2. Most people are building their own data center KEKW
[6:13:01] Batmooooon: mil cargo
[6:13:01] ChilledChamploo: 300 butc takes too long to mine for sure
[6:13:02] vrYasu: storage
[6:13:13] bonewp: btc*
[6:13:15] yaPPer808: it’s gonna be limited by the robbery contracts not the bp
[6:13:16] theoutcastboi: @iiidaaah It's 300, plus 50 for the heist for the parts, plus like, 300 more for the ammo and mag blueprints, so it's more like 700-800 BTC for guns
[6:13:17] etalag: cool
[6:13:21] OGEpic_: MIL
[6:13:37] shiifon: Some probably look bigger than they are

[6:13:58] ChilledChamploo: dope
[6:13:59] megamanyvr: going higher and higher LUL
[6:14:05] theoutcastboi: And even then, these are only pistols, rifles and machine guns and stuff are going to cost thousands and thousands of BTC
[6:14:06] Nickknows: @MinotaurFluff 100% KEKW
[6:14:08] chibi10011: JUICE IT UP
[6:14:11] nsk_envy: That's for the Don's house haha
[6:14:19] iiidaaah: @theoutcastboi yeah what I meant is, the amounts dont really matter. Eventually everyone will get there. Would be pretty boring if everyone eventually makes their own guns
[6:14:23] ChilledChamploo: the new reinforced crate  juice it upp
[6:14:25] GreasySlothKing: most are just props fyi
[6:14:29] lvlagg: each prop has different storage and slots
[6:14:30] KcsBack: Thats badass lol
[6:14:30] xMike6: ooo it has 1000kg nice

[6:15:20] stpotato9: is it only for money?
[6:15:44] Jess17: do mili storage
[6:15:48] GreasySlothKing: ooh they added functionality for these ones now
[6:15:54] theoutcastboi: @iiidaaah That's what will happen eventually, atleast with these sorts of pistols. But it'll take weeks for them to be widespread, especially with the heists for parts having week long cooldowns - limiting the amount of parts that you can even get.
[6:16:16] lunorx6: bruh
[6:16:20] ChilledChamploo: lol
[6:16:25] Thunamin: Build a vault
[6:16:30] theoutcastboi: *I'd personally also like to see the blueprint degrade - maybe you can only make 10 guns with it before it degrades?*
[6:16:33] obscurewill: 1000 is same as just using the ground
[6:16:36] xMike6: wonder if dirty money works with that
[6:16:37] CourageTheCowardIy: that’s for a lot of money
[6:16:38] Batmooooon: use military crate
[6:16:41] vrYasu: you do its the one in the bench room
[6:16:42] iiidaaah: safe is 240 OMEGADANCE

[6:19:17] bidaboo: @lyfmobile will it be the same group as today or will harry join?
[6:19:27] ryan__mize: wonder if the ammo crate is only for guns?

[6:21:05] theoutcastboi: @NoTaGain15151 I'd agree with that - first in, best dressed, and also they had no way of knowing the cooldown - if it'd been a week like the others, they'd have been screwed
[6:21:11] nsk_envy: That theory was correct then
[6:21:14] Nickknows: lol this scuffed ass set up really worked
[6:21:18] lyfmobile: vents working?

[6:21:30] apache78: Bets on if buddha ever puts lights in here?
