[2:34:40] m0stlywater: I see microsoft buying it at some point
[2:34:56] Jay_rb: Twitch even needed to have Nvidia save their encoder PepeLa
[2:35:03] oIThumb: thought microsoft before
[2:35:06] Frozen_yakman: if the business model isn't working, they might start passing the hosting costs for an individual stream on to the streamer

[2:35:45] oIThumb: I think someone will buy twitch
[2:35:54] uowaep_: @eod_soldier i dunno, there's already strong established competition there
[2:35:56] Kroykumzz: don't let elon see this MONKA
[2:35:57] Brandonhipster: streamer can only stream 4 hours a day to save data storage LUL

[2:36:54] augu85: the main problem with that is payment services turning away when there is a true 18+ section
[2:37:04] The1andonlyLJ: 18 could save twitch
[2:37:16] Nertholl: most of twitch losees are "on paper". Amazon charges them retail price for AWS but it's obviously all coming out the same pot. All just where they want to report losses for best tax benefits
