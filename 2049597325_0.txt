[2:59:01] mister_nibbles: yeah i smoked for like 5 years and the smell of it makes me sick to my stomach now
[2:59:03] NoharTheShark: growing up with asthma and a parent that smoked was not great
[2:59:07] teacupcryptids: That reminds me of the Tiktok where the girl said all her apartment neighbors started playing I'm a Gummy Bear when someone smokes in their complex and it stopped the smoker
[2:59:07] DirectorStephanie: katesD
[2:59:08] Insaif: The people that work at the massage parlor next to my work go out back and smoke all the time. The smell gets blown into our building and I hate it.

[3:01:28] ElectronicChaos: Pears poached in sweet white wine, reduce the wine, serve over ice cream
[3:01:30] doc_sharon: we got this weed run katesLuck

[3:12:19] if0rg0t2remember: it is kinda road captain stuff but there is no road captain
[3:12:22] kangg: the jewelry store robbery Nancy did with bbmc was wild
[3:12:28] AshuraX13: I still loved how cool that clip was of Nancy in the Corvette being directed in job comms, and her and a BBMC member both pulling onto the same street at the same time. It was so clean
[3:12:41] Insaif: Frankly, the fact that there ISN'T a Road Captain or SAA means it's even more important for someone to step up and make it an issue.
[3:12:48] ThomasTheDestroyer: I remember the one time that BBMC joined the PD to chase someone in the club for shits and giggles and one of the cops got on a radio with BBMC and was talking about how their comms are so much better than the cops.
