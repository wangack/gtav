[0:20:48] WundertueteGER: that would be sick
[0:20:58] xKaeyo: Free 7/11 Mega Gulp for Life!!!!!
[0:21:03] Metric: "the customer is right" - the backbone of capitalism
[0:21:14] NemisizZ: and their first born should be named after them too as compensation
[0:21:20] zexx0: as an american, free soda isn't gunna cut it
[0:21:30] zexx0: customer service
[0:21:31] NemisizZ: service desk?
[0:21:40] gostonko: especially hospitality
[0:21:43] gostonko: fuck that
[0:21:54] divandesalon: my order had not enough fat in it !!
[0:22:16] NemisizZ: they are as ungreathful here tbh, even if its an internal helpdesk, they just expect you to fix it regardless and it has to be here and now
[0:22:50] Zechss_: 41 raiders from Zechss_ have joined! 
[0:22:50] StreamElements: Zechss_ just raided the channel with 41 viewers
[0:22:57] Zardete: Customer service doesn't require prior education so that's the main appeal imo
[0:23:00] WundertueteGER: Pog
[0:23:01] AttaboyNL: Could be a certain generation that has that expectation?
[0:23:22] steveroo1: tip culture is so foreign to australians
[0:23:50] Metric: As a Brit, I found the fake smiles and happiness in the service industry in America really jarring.
[0:24:09] NemisizZ: in archeage they got so damaged from that mentality they entire economy in the game got fucked over because of compensation lol
[0:24:19] gostonko: tipping NoThanks

[0:24:57] NemisizZ: but a tip here is more of a bonus, its not really expected
[0:25:27] gostonko: tipping here is a cultural faux pas
[0:25:46] divandesalon: good service deserves a tip indeed
[0:25:48] brutalmoineau: you're the problem nidas KEKW
[0:25:53] steveroo1: lmao
[0:25:54] mariuspure: classic nidas off menu items maaaaan
[0:25:57] gostonko: nidas worst customer???
[0:26:00] xKaeyo: Did they have the tears of a sad russian clown? Kappa
[0:26:10] bndzor: i tip when im happy or foreced to like in us
[0:26:18] punishedkai: I hate tipping in america
[0:26:43] xKaeyo: damn
[0:26:49] punishedkai: gostonko have you ever tipped before
[0:26:54] Metric: That's a bit more than 10%
[0:27:02] NemisizZ: almost a double pay that month
[0:27:03] divandesalon: he has an assistant for every stuffs even for taking a dump
[0:27:03] gostonko: punishedkai dont think so
[0:27:07] divandesalon: tip assistant
[0:27:22] punishedkai: maaaaan i literally have no idea how to do it they give me a check and i go 10% and then have no idea what happens next
[0:27:33] gostonko: maaaaan
[0:27:46] bndzor: thing is in us they get super upset when not tipping
[0:27:51] bndzor: so u are kinda forced to
[0:27:56] xKaeyo: tipping is for when the service was outstandingly good
[0:27:59] xKaeyo: imo
[0:28:00] Zardete: I mean if you have Mick Jagger kind of money I'd have no problem tipping. Probably not 400% though KEKW
[0:28:20] gearofnett: yeah that's how it is. Some fancy restaurants here have automatic tip addon AND THEN STILL HAVE A FIELD FOR CUSTOM TIP
[0:28:22] mariuspure: I mean not like you're gonna get shot over not tipping in America?
[0:28:29] mariuspure: mhm
[0:28:34] Metric: In America the servers aren't paid a full wage becuase it's expected to be subsidised by tips and that's what's fucked about it.
[0:28:36] DopestKush: tipping has gotten worse in the US with things like square pay
[0:28:46] DopestKush: literally asking for tips when ordering coffee
[0:28:47] caseyjolly: type in less for bad service
[0:28:57] punishedkai: from where I ate they brought over a tipping thing after I already paid and I just wrote down a number and then left
[0:29:02] divandesalon: tip is rude in japan KEKW
[0:29:11] DopestKush: I usually only tip if im sitting
[0:29:13] gostonko: kai KEKW
[0:29:21] steveroo1: ive seen those uber eats guys get so worked up because they wouldn't tip ccrazy
[0:29:24] xKaeyo: Pro tipp: If you tell them you tip -10%, the server will actually have to give you money
[0:29:40] gostonko: 5Head
[0:29:51] caseyjolly: theres a bar near me with an attached burger restaurant and their ipad tip options are 20%, 30% and 40% so if you're not paying attention they get ya
[0:30:01] NemisizZ: lol and then you have to pay the other half of their paycheck lol
[0:30:09] steveroo1: 40% huh
[0:30:12] WundertueteGER: KEKW
[0:30:12] Zardete: If you are going to a place where you have to tip it's easy to calculate and add 10-20% to the item cost
[0:30:12] DopestKush: @caseyjolly I hate that
[0:30:14] divandesalon: 40% tip fuck that
[0:30:17] bndzor: some places have that in us, not many but it exists where they add 10% automatic and they brag on about it like its a good thing
[0:30:18] JasonIndy: I tip drive through workers. They aren't making shit
[0:30:26] Waron_: tax not being included on the price labels in supermarkets in the us is insane to me
[0:30:27] K4ZZD: do you have to tip? is it obligatory?
[0:30:36] JasonIndy: It should always be your choice
[0:30:46] WundertueteGER: just tip 100 4Head
[0:30:51] BotDoris: nidas live! woo! BRICKEDUP
[0:30:57] mariuspure: HUH
[0:30:58] gostonko: BotDoris WeirdDude
[0:31:02] K4ZZD: so you cant say no?
[0:31:03] NemisizZ: not to mention if ur from a country where a few dollars is a lot, then you tip them what you think its a lot but for them is peanuts
[0:31:13] xKaeyo: @K4ZZD like an unspoken rule in america. Europe is more chill with it
[0:31:21] WundertueteGER: NO GIGACHAD
[0:31:24] DopestKush: spit in your food KEKW
[0:31:31] divandesalon: force someone to tip in france and u get a revolution again KEKW
[0:31:31] caseyjolly: youre kind of an asshole if you dont tip at a sit down restaurant, other places its different
[0:31:33] gearofnett: Current meta is 15% minimum, 20% if good service for small party, 25%+ for big party
[0:31:33] gostonko: they pull out their AR-15
[0:31:34] K4ZZD: @K4ZZD so nothings written in stone? why would i then
[0:31:34] JasonIndy: your food will get the special treatment next time
[0:31:38] bndzor: the thing in us is you can skip to tip if you dindt like the food, but in the end its the waiter that gets screwed over which sucks
[0:31:39] xKaeyo: spit on you? KEKW
[0:31:42] NemisizZ: lol @gostonko
[0:31:44] WundertueteGER: @gostonko monkaS
[0:32:07] ezpz_lemon_sqez: when ever I got to the US I just double the tax amount and that’s how much I tip usually between 16-18%
[0:32:11] K4ZZD: interesting
[0:32:17] NemisizZ: but why not take 20% more for the food and then pay them better
[0:32:17] Zardete: I think I saw on reddit several times people posting their receipts in America where the tip was forced in KEKW
[0:32:40] caseyjolly: oh yeah thats a thing @Zardete
[0:32:44] WundertueteGER: KEKW
[0:32:45] gostonko: Americans were losing their minds on twitter yesterday because our stadiums arent surrounded by miles and miles of car parking maaaaan
[0:32:51] caseyjolly: any parter over 6 people typically its included
[0:32:54] caseyjolly: pary&
[0:32:55] xKaeyo: grubhub does it here in germany aswell
[0:32:56] caseyjolly: party* jesus
[0:33:05] NemisizZ: they done the same here on justeat, i refuse...
[0:33:25] xKaeyo: but I always tip them in cash, cause sometimes the app just sends it to the company and you have no idea if the drivers actually get it
[0:33:30] ViceroyStark: ❤️
[0:33:34] NemisizZ: not gonna pay for delivery and then also have to tip them, like wtf, the delivery alone should pay for everything
[0:33:41] CuppaT_XYZ: @gostonko KKonaW where the hell do you drink beer and make bbqs before the game brother
[0:33:45] divandesalon: a tip should always be in cash and go to the worker pocket not the boss
[0:33:51] gostonko: CuppaT_XYZ literally maaaaan
[0:33:57] NemisizZ: i cant remember when i used cash the last time tbh
[0:34:00] xKaeyo: I have a jar with just 1s and 2s
[0:34:15] WundertueteGER: PauseChamp
[0:34:21] DopestKush: only cash I carry is coins in my car for the self car wash
[0:34:24] NemisizZ: asset flips?
[0:34:29] caseyjolly: theres a thing where if restaurants pay a decent wage, they'll take a percentage of tips to recoup that wage
[0:34:30] gostonko: those .io games?
[0:34:36] WundertueteGER: damn I need to get into this market
[0:34:38] mariuspure: Every mobile game company ever

[0:36:01] CuppaT_XYZ: ah achievement hunters YEP
[0:36:11] brutalmoineau: that's just sad KEKW
[0:36:31] DopestKush: 5Head exploiting a niche market
[0:36:33] caseyjolly: good for him tbh
[0:36:41] gostonko: i'm ok with idiot tax
[0:36:41] NemisizZ: flappy bird is also a rather simple game
[0:36:45] divandesalon: soon ia made game or is it real already ??
