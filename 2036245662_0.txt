[1:00:52] spyrossoulis00: If the vehicle is 90%/100% you charge $900. If the vehicle is 80%/100% you charge $1350 for 1 part across

[3:40:36] deerlakeboy: Sorry just thinking out loud
[3:40:40] itschampa: house robberies just have almost 0 risk at the moment for the amount people can lose
[3:40:44] ClasTwerk: has house robberies been removed?
[3:40:58] Starblaiz: Yeh its not very realistic either. Imagine trying to rob a cop for a gun IRL, you would be lucky to get away with your life XD
[3:41:00] ian_c_89: police didnt really need to have guns on them seeing as the crims didnt have access to them
[3:41:01] CoOp0012: @Shotz any new on the class action against mary?
[3:41:03] itschampa: @ClasTwerk no longer allowed until further notice

[3:41:10] OutofRightField: Classic CG nerf, but yea the wipe/ocean dump combo was too far from the other group
[3:41:12] ThreeNPink: @Shotz we have a points redeem for you to say " Ya Sista's A**"
[3:41:14] b_goodhue: I wish the keys were like blue prints so when it gets cut it slowly breaks so u know if someone cuts your key when u get robbed

[3:41:28] ThreeNPink: @Shotz we have a points redeem for you to say " Ya Sista's A**"

[3:41:35] deerlakeboy: PopCorn
[3:41:41] FatGirlDrunk: @ClasTwerk When you rob an admin, of course it gets removed. If a gun didnt exist, home robberies wouldnt be a thing.
[3:41:44] tunacand1ck: @Starblaiz cant really compare irl to rp 101
[3:41:45] benbeanz420: lol

[3:43:45] micfool: @itschampa like for real, how do they found out some group like K got a big loot, like no word is out, so ez to assume those that did it this morning are all meta
[3:43:47] Rcninja6r: Remember when CG convinced ramee that he was color blind?  shotzLul
