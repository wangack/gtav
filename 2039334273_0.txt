[3:37:26] JeePecks: Does it wear off? The DNA?
[3:37:26] BlakeChaos: Are cops not following the mask laws for state run businesses? Or can crims literally go into a business and work with a mask with a warrant?
[3:37:26] Paxipher: DNA is perfection
[3:37:32] Paxipher: gonna help SO much in the future
[3:37:36] Rootbritney: So its better for creating a timeline?
[3:37:39] Kaztiell: @solid1244 how is it more op than anything else they had in 3.0, like blood etc
[3:37:42] krilosrs: DNA isnt OP, they can throw that shit out of a moving vehicle
[3:37:47] eleanorflexonya1: i wish twitch would disable the chat feature for RP streams LUL

[3:39:06] sneakypeakydk: @AsuniRS bruv.. shut it
[3:39:14] xagious: holding firearm out without shooting pinging seem OP, it should only be for shots.
[3:39:24] Zunnun: @bdg_toa676 you the one bby deansoP
[3:39:34] fate024: Im curious about this DNA stuff, did they get nunu's yesterday for example?

[3:39:55] eastcoast_99: is that Max
[3:40:00] Zacknado44: its realistic not powerful
[3:40:04] f0rbin: @xagious firearms are illegal, no licenses yet
[3:40:08] RonJon: @xagious yeah because bystanders wont' call the cops unless you shoot them
[3:40:11] Zacknado44: at the end of the day a smart criminal shouldnt be brandishing a firearm
[3:40:12] xagious: agreed firearm pings should only be for shot, not for having it out with no shot
[3:40:21] BDG_Toa676: Very entertaining
[3:40:22] begixdxd: IF it doesn't change
[3:40:25] Zunnun: @xagious how if a civ see you with a üî´  they report aint allowed to open carry etc
[3:40:28] adrian_md46: Hmm
[3:40:30] flash9807: hard to aim
[3:40:30] zekonja17: any clips?
[3:40:33] GhostSkull0: ok TY
[3:40:34] BDG_Toa676: FA FA FA
[3:40:34] Rootbritney: Cuz that gun is so shit LUL

[3:40:36] tkmoney: Deansocool your a great asset to NoPixel man appreciate your RP
[3:40:37] Panos_97: It won't always be that way
[3:40:38] jockstarraidz: you noiis heal alot aswell
[3:40:40] theblackdog808: It was intense at the time
[3:40:40] RonJon: @xagious its only if a local sees it and call the cops. If they see them then they should be called on cause its illegal
[3:40:44] tempesta003: Only slow because of the shooter, if it was a arena grinder it woulda been faster omE
[3:40:46] danielb2705: Glad it wasn't 2 bullets and car is out
[3:40:50] deadliestbush: Someone got clip of that shootout?
[3:40:51] Shade_B: Crazy from the other perspective too
[3:40:52] jaceymarsha11: How do the locals no they don't have a gun licence?
[3:40:53] AFCBlade: yeah man was a fun watch!
[3:40:55] KappaManJason: any captains on
[3:40:56] DrWings87: I'm sorry chat, If I'm working at a ranch and a bunch of people pull up and one has a gun, I'm calling the damn cops....
[3:40:58] TheAsvin: the shootout was good the chase was painful
[3:41:00] Zunnun: @ronjon fr
[3:41:02] MPGod42: need a partner, hard to steer and shoot
[3:41:03] xagious: @Zunnun pretty sure it pings when no local are around.
[3:41:05] theblackdog808: But then again it was intense cause it doesn't happen that often
[3:41:09] Gachiguru: open carry in an RP server is HECOOKED
[3:41:16] xypher85: veryCat just stuffed my face with lamb biryani BUSSIN
[3:41:18] Panos_97: @Deansocool Do you think vehicular shootouts will lead to having two cops per vehicle on patrol?
[3:41:18] RonJon: @xagious no it doesn't
[3:41:24] Zacknado44: @jaceymarsha11 open carry is very rare even with a licence
[3:41:31] tommytsnutz: it was Ight to watch
[3:41:32] flash9807: @DrWings87 your at a rant people are ganan have guns tbh
[3:41:33] Zacknado44: @jaceymarsha11 i thinks its a special type of licence
[3:41:34] Mr__Chikin: that is one of the laughs of all time
[3:41:39] l_kenpachi_l: Can u be a corrupt cop? Sell crim guns?
[3:41:44] BDG_Toa676: @drwings87 idk depends really cuz if they coming in fast with guns I'm FA FA FA
[3:41:49] adrian_md46: @l_kenpachi_l it's a no no
[3:41:49] RonJon: @jaceymarsha11 Nobody has a gun license right now
[3:41:50] Zacknado44: @l_kenpachi_l dont think so
[3:41:55] SleiFever: I wonder how Cornwood will react to hearing him getting shot at
[3:41:55] Gachiguru: @l_kenpachi_l youd get banned theres no serial numbers
[3:42:02] Sonicfear: @l_kenpachi_l mehdiNopers
[3:42:07] n0oxaskek: @l_kenpachi_l probably ban
[3:42:07] Zunnun: @bdg_toa676 you forgot to add A FA
[3:42:09] SoulYou_: i just saw the clips from today, it was a long day for Den for sure. The pit was top class btw KEKW
[3:42:18] DrWings87: @flash9807 Yes, if I know the person works there then I wouldn't call the cops, but the Locals Knew they didn't belong at the ranch
[3:42:26] BDG_Toa676: FA cup deansoRNG
[3:42:26] Shade_B: they'll slip up one of these days *shakes fist*
[3:42:32] jaceymarsha11: @zacknado44 but how do locals know that like if your stood on your own property and get your gun out its gonna ping its abit over powered
[3:42:32] Zacknado44: who was the one who shot at den?
[3:42:32] TheLadyCupcake: @SleiFever esfandCOPS did you kill them?
[3:42:40] SleiFever: @TheLadyCupcake HUH
[3:42:41] marneraiders: Can‚Äôt wait for Cornwoods and slacks reaction to that incident
[3:42:42] TheAsvin: kind of sad that you didn‚Äôt hear the handoff during the scuffle at s buns
[3:42:44] dylanconlon6: have u seen the first terrorist report?
[3:43:08] Kiwi_lul: why're people arguing mechanics in chat
[3:43:09] Zacknado44: @jaceymarsha11 thats why its a brandishing a firearm call the cops go and check if they have an open carry licence realistically
[3:43:24] Zacknado44: your trying to hard to call it "op"
[3:43:27] MPGod42: fentanyl IV

[3:44:11] RonJon: @jaceymarsha11 HOw is that overpowered? If you're allowed to do it and have a license then the cops will leave you alone and no problem. If you don't then you get the cops called on you
[3:44:13] Sonicfear: This Hall monitor deal...weird.
[3:44:18] Stealthy_Phenotype: Chat, can you RP remove GSR?
[3:44:23] bamsebams: did you see the clip of x shooting
[3:44:25] sneakypeakydk: who was that in the back?
[3:44:27] Shade_B: @l_kenpachi_l I dont think it would be ban-worthy, but after you lost your gun without a good excuse it would be tougher to play in that role
[3:44:41] AsuniRS: sniper
[3:44:43] Kiwi_lul: !meta
[3:44:43] Fossabot: Don't tell Dean information about other characters that he does not know in game. He cannot do things if it is said in chat and he sees it. Sit back and just enjoy the rp.
