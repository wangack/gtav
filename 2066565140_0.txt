[7:25:19] MilkteaJae: @kronzillla KEKW
[7:25:28] KeckyOK: it looks like you can snap it in half in the middle
[7:25:32] SlinkyMcMasters: is it flexible or pretty hard?
[7:25:47] daffodil86: it's smoother and has better detail I think than an FDM printer
[7:25:49] KeckyOK: weak point in the middle there
[7:25:57] kronzillla: print a herbert NODDERS
[7:26:08] slorebear: the middle is where it wiggles
[7:26:12] slorebear: to simulate swimming
[7:26:16] slorebear: right?
[7:26:21] Bulfwyne: DinoDance all that wiggle wiggle
[7:26:21] KeckyOK: ah flexibility?
[7:26:28] Bulfwyne: yea @slorebear its how it moves through the water
[7:26:32] creepycutie66: travpiWIGGLE travpiWIGGLE
[7:26:42] KeckyOK: if it were rigid that would be a design flaw but now I see
[7:26:48] Bulfwyne: yeee
[7:26:51] KeckyOK: it's wedged so it can flex
[7:26:57] daffodil86: yeah when it's cast in the polymer used for worms and other plastic baits it'll wiggle
[7:27:07] krist0: Joel
[7:27:20] KeckyOK: I just showed up so I thought it was hard plastic heh
[7:27:32] KeckyOK: didn't know it was a soft body lure
[7:27:39] ky05uk3: Jebby travpiLove
[7:27:40] Bulfwyne: @KeckyOK depends :D some are and some are soft plstic
[7:27:47] daffodil86: no worries man!
[7:27:57] Suvaacc: you trying to sell them commercially?
[7:27:58] Bulfwyne: can do layering and stuff
[7:28:14] Bulfwyne: Yea have fun first
[7:28:20] Bulfwyne: don't make it work or else you'll get burnt
[7:28:25] KeckyOK: man, never try to sell fishing products cause fish are into real weird shit
[7:28:43] Bulfwyne: Etsy is a bit tough, but locally i sell good
[7:28:48] kronzillla: Fishildo V1
[7:28:52] Bulfwyne: i go and sell at outdoor places
[7:29:13] frigginoasis: says bite this lol
[7:29:24] KeckyOK: the pickerel up here were picky and they loved bright yellow heads with white wiggly grub tails
[7:29:24] kronzillla: dick lures NODDERS
[7:29:30] daffodil86: are you sticking to glide and swim baits for now?
[7:29:31] Bulfwyne: KEKW I gotta print my Dick Injection thing, worm style ned rig so its versitle
[7:29:49] Bulfwyne: it is
[7:30:07] KeckyOK: gotta test em, see if it wiggles enough if the tail has turbulence
[7:30:24] daffodil86: ya true there is a lot more manufacturing going into modern lures these days
[7:30:25] Bulfwyne: its fun tho :D
[7:30:43] kronzillla: damn jenny
[7:30:58] ThePotatoParamedic: LUL LUL LUL
[7:31:04] KeckyOK: the hook could be set before the tail so it doesn't interfere with the flappin'
[7:31:07] daffodil86: can you put little pieces of tungsten in a pour?
[7:31:10] sucio71989: LUL
[7:31:12] KeckyOK: another day in Los Santos
[7:31:12] Bulfwyne: Oh yea, the Soft Plastics you see in shops, They use a cheaper plstisol and shoot them into a mold just once, when your a home maker ... you need a good plastisol that lasts a few melts
[7:31:17] ThePotatoParamedic: Time to spiral Jenny tobiiiSipspin
[7:31:36] daffodil86: ah
[7:31:44] KeckyOK: ah hm hm more hooks
[7:32:00] Bulfwyne: and then you got wire forming NODDERS thats a trade in itself
[7:32:05] iLL_sKiiLLz: i just bought my first "money doesn't matter" reel for swimbaits
[7:32:08] Bulfwyne: to get the hook ups for hooks
[7:32:28] Bulfwyne: yeee they got different guages
[7:32:30] Bulfwyne: yea
[7:32:31] KeckyOK: looks like a baby trout :L
[7:32:36] Raveen1234: id be afraid that something on the lure would break on a nice fish
[7:32:39] KeckyOK: minnow
[7:33:07] KeckyOK: as long as you have good line, and a leader
[7:33:26] KeckyOK: leader saves it from big fish biting over the line
[7:33:36] Bulfwyne: @Raveen1234 they make soft plastics that are like 6-7 inches for king salmon with teeth, can catch a good 15 fish on a lure before its chewed up depending tho
[7:33:45] Bulfwyne: yea Magdrafts are good
[7:34:00] KeckyOK: I like the taste of campfire pickerel / walleye
[7:34:04] daffodil86: look for jewelry pliers on Amazon that might help with wire bending
[7:34:11] KeckyOK: gut and fillet
[7:34:14] Bulfwyne: yea rounded plyers
[7:34:20] Bulfwyne: there are specific tools
[7:34:28] KeckyOK: I bury the guts instead of float em.  bears, dude.
[7:34:33] Bulfwyne: and also wire forming tools
