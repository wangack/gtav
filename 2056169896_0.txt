[0:53:15] gigamex: 3 instances then
[0:53:20] adzse: In Ancient Asia, death by elephant was a popular form of execution. They were taught many different ways to torture the condemned such as, to throw the victim into the air and then trample them, slowly break bones, crush skulls, twist off limbs, or even execute people using large blades fitted to their tusks. In some parts of Asia, this method of execution was still popular up to the late 19th century. dizzTHINK
