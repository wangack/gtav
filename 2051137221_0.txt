[2:06:28] CCookiies: Good for a robbery
[2:06:30] IamthaKingslayer: did u see the hellion was in the same scene as the tulip in the gta 6 trailer
[2:06:40] kharnie30: Oh do you have to chop it where the game chooses?
[2:06:53] SuperKoorie: What do you make of the 4.0 economy so far? @Whippy
[2:07:21] kharnie30: Pity you can't make a shed in the Billy be the chop spot
[2:07:21] Lunar_Delta: Needs a bit more tweaking but its improved overall IMO
[2:07:23] coliinn: g6 is cracked rn
[2:07:24] BloomOnline: Scarcity is making funds less valuable
[2:07:32] coliinn: like 1.5k for 10 min of work
[2:07:44] Lunar_Delta: Oh yeah you have to take the dog house off. its in between the front seats
[2:07:52] Mic_Stargazer: There's just not enough to spend money on I think, no cash sinks since cars are out of reach for most
[2:07:54] DOWNBAD_ELLY: I just hope people slow down with the speed running and don’t get burned out Sadge
[2:08:19] Lunar_Delta: DinoDance AW YOU TURNED IT OFFF
[2:08:29] jjanieee: aw that was a good song
[2:08:34] Lunar_Delta: Sadge
[2:08:36] Mic_Stargazer: I'm very surprised G6 hasn't been nerfed but my take is that the cash is the incentive to run it to begin with since crim is so tightly connected to it for rep
[2:08:50] SuperKoorie: so ya said in discord ya gonna be rich today, eh?
[2:08:56] xetrovj: the interior of that van looks like my in game clothes in bloodborne after 5 min of gameplay
[2:08:58] Lunar_Delta: Not the one that was on, the song before this one
[2:08:59] kharnie30: A wreckers lot and warehouse would be a good side hussle for bbmc. Like sopranos garbage facility
[2:09:25] finnish00: @whippy btw I found the song I was asking about it name was special death
[2:09:40] Mic_Stargazer: When you factor in your costs into the price of robbing one it definitely cuts heavily into your take
[2:10:13] Lunar_Delta: @Mic_Stargazer I think G6 trucks replaced bank robberies since theres more RP. So there needs to be a reason to do G6 runs, but also sufficient gains from robbing them.
[2:10:18] DDDDAAAAANNNN: hope tommy come on today
[2:10:33] noahdienekes: it costs Connections LUL

[2:11:00] Ushety: also a crowbar and vehicle repairs
[2:11:39] finnish00: If I am correct most of vans in  real life kind of pain in ass to work on but I may be wrong about it
[2:11:43] Mic_Stargazer: All the rentals,/repairs, piles of andages if you do sewer runs, potential fines, just "price of doing business"
