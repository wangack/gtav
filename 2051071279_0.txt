[8:47:57] RogueBear: @StreetBull you can do it IRL. an engine can take it. the back pressure on the engine slows the cylinders which produces less engine power slowing the car. dont overdo it obviously. the RPMs jump when you do it so you dont just tank it down to 1st from 6th
[8:48:01] StreetBull: oop
