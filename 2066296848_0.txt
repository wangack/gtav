[4:01:16] raeghost: Uwu cafe still running??
[4:01:25] he1s3nb3rgg: yea and also it could go south quick
[4:01:32] CosmicQuibble: can't  wait to visit new orleans again - best shrimp. best beignets. nearly best jazz
[4:01:33] raeghost: Ohhhhh
[4:01:51] he1s3nb3rgg: @raeghost Nono
[4:02:05] Hilink24: honestly cops are being busted more for not following the rules not OVERfollowing the rules so
[4:02:18] raeghost: Ohhh @he1s3nb3rgg
[4:02:32] infinitemoon87: Ramee is a good lawyer ashlolDance
[4:02:38] BeckaEliza: or why not do what they do with snr buns
[4:02:45] Hilink24: Fashion Police
[4:02:46] I3ailey: cause a cop irl wouldnt question ur work outfit
[4:02:48] Hilink24: HYPERLUL
[4:02:55] Cambellar: it feels a little to authoriterian
[4:03:03] he1s3nb3rgg: it's very judging of other people to do that NODDERS
[4:03:10] raeghost: Ohhhh gaaawwwweddd the fashion police department
[4:03:12] s0liddew: contest it and go to fashion court
[4:03:17] nyanskis: it infringes on civil rights or something
[4:03:24] ciphz: they dont want g6 drivers not wearing uniform
[4:03:24] BeckaEliza: why can snr buns and mosleys have it where there is a work outfit.
[4:03:25] Madknightwolf: Makes since for g6 but not other things I feel
[4:03:30] Hilink24: sorry i was trying to SLAY
[4:03:34] Hilink24: geegaSlayyy
[4:03:35] zephervvv: i mean they can do whatever they want right? they can go up to Susie and say, your vest says your a dock worker, but you are wearing it for sanitation
[4:03:37] JarrodBaniqued: It’s all Michael Simone who wrote it, he’s most to blame
[4:03:38] I3ailey: imagine cops berating cashiers about their shit :D
[4:03:40] Afroman670: you're wearing a hat on the back of the sani truck? here's a ticket LUL
[4:03:41] StreamElements: Thanks for following Groggxt! ashlolFlower
[4:03:44] nanara_: It feels strange because it gives them another avenue of powertripping. The more laws there are a cop can rattle off at you to "get you", the worse the experience gets
[4:03:48] I3ailey: 100%
[4:04:15] he1s3nb3rgg: peepoGiggles yea
[4:04:16] LuluAilurus: The way I see it, there is a difference between cops saying: thats not appropiate - and just saying that something doesnt seem safe, and recommend like you are wearing a vest, and just recommend wearing a vest to people who dont do that.
[4:04:22] Asaayu: The city girl who is comically underdressed for the job KEKW
[4:04:25] I3ailey: gatekeepy
[4:04:33] BeckaEliza: exactly so why not just give a work uniform jacket.
[4:04:44] Hilink24: actually you are a perfect example you wear shorts while dealing with trash but i dont think anyone would wanna get mystery soup on their legs during trash cleanup
[4:04:45] Falconari: yup
[4:04:46] JarrodBaniqued: on my way to wear a red minidress to my hazmat handling job
[4:04:49] raeghost: Should be the employers
[4:04:55] BeckaEliza: So then you can wear whatever you want on the bottom
[4:04:57] Cambellar: i supose a reasoning is they are state owned so the state has to enforce it
[4:05:23] JarrodBaniqued: it does
[4:05:37] original_t_rep: $1000
[4:05:40] JarrodBaniqued: but it isn’t the reason Simone wrote it LUL
[4:05:46] odie721: cops don’t enforce that stuff. need OSHA  for that
[4:05:50] SilliTFT: Alex River has tried telling people at g6 to wear uniform+vest and to have trucks stay same color, but people are kinda stubborn saying "naah why should we"
[4:05:54] nopixelismytv: DinoDance
[4:06:04] Afroman670: no gloves for sani? here's another ticket nono
[4:06:09] ciphz: gotta see how the world will be and how enforced it will be
[4:06:10] MadnessQuotient: Flop is still awake?
[4:06:13] SilliTFT: so until there's actual managers laws are only way ig
[4:06:18] TrEE_TV: the 2 main reasons they did it were the people cutting trees in high heels and to help the cops diferentiatie between who is the "bad guy" in robbery situations, they go to a stick up and everyone is in all black they dont actually know who is being robbed vs who is working
[4:06:25] JarrodBaniqued: Crane said he doesn’t want to make an EPA or OSHA in the meeting
[4:06:26] ClickClackCC: I think for sani it will probably just be a vest mandate
[4:06:31] TrEE_TV: they used this as an example
[4:06:36] I3ailey: @TrEE_TV ah makes sense
[4:06:43] Hilink24: Stare
[4:06:48] he1s3nb3rgg: Stare
[4:06:49] nanara_: My neighbor actually had the cops show up because of twitter before. Crazy stuff
[4:06:52] CosmicQuibble: talking to New Orleans.. guilty
[4:06:55] caveman76xx: Where does the money go from the fines is it a money making scheme
[4:07:07] I3ailey: OSHA is a safety commity

[4:07:40] odie721: Occupational Safety and Health Administration
[4:07:42] Hilink24: they make sure people are doing safe shit while working like require hardhats
[4:07:54] Falconari: NODDERS
