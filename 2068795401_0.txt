[7:21:27] squoogelol: could also see if people are buying wood for more too
[7:21:28] lblvckmvgicl: so its like 320 planks with 4 pallets
[7:22:08] Random_Slacker: if the lumber union still buys, even if its worse then selling yourself, it will be more too
[7:22:36] Anrisacia: It would be a little more because you can also fit some logs outside the pallets too NODDERS
[7:22:37] Random_Slacker: and I think the truck can technically hold 6 pallets at once, not 100% sure though
[7:22:37] Scanda4: would it be worth trying to sell storage as well? kivaSus
[7:22:53] Madam_Orange: @Random_Slacker yeah i think so

[7:23:45] Madam_Orange: since forever
[7:23:54] Anrisacia: Yeah it was always 6
[7:24:00] Thrath: Think you have only done 4 since it split that way
[7:24:13] Random_Slacker: it does eat up the bp faster, so more cash there? idk why, haha

[7:24:23] Thrath: 1440 per run
[7:25:12] Madam_Orange: kivaLUL

[7:25:41] squoogelol: dont have to clean lumber money either
[7:26:04] Ashtahh: Is anyone doing the shine runs if Siz isn’t?
[7:26:20] Thrath: If you averaged an hour per run and did a full 12 hours it would be 17.2k
[7:26:48] jdeflume: How much does each pallet cost? Like bp cost divided by # per bp
[7:27:35] Random_Slacker: if you did this with stanley too, you could fill 3 pallets each
[7:27:42] Random_Slacker: it splits the cash, but the chopping should be faster
[7:27:43] ShinsetsuTenshi: Do you already have a spreadsheet set up for shine to track what combinations you've tried and the results? rooThink
[7:28:01] Thrath: Also just noticed the logs change quality when you mix them now
[7:28:02] Vinkari: Yeah with how the moonshine runs works you could easily partner up with Stanley and do them at the same time in same car
[7:28:05] Figueronie: @random_slacker Stanley is probably building sani rep. Can't help cut wood
