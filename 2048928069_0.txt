[0:26:20] steveroo1: is this about the pc ?
[0:26:23] gostonko: dev meta PepoThink
[0:26:26] gostonko: !meta
[0:26:27] StreamElements: Telling Nidas information that he wouldn't have known without you telling him in the stream. For example if you're watching another stream at the same time and telling Nidas things that are actively happening on the other persons stream. Doing this will get you timed out or banned.
[0:26:30] ELEGlGGLE: using meta from devs deadass
[0:26:33] Raccoonsteps: @gostonko THIS
[0:26:38] epic_smee: so somebody else has to find the solution? KEKW

[0:27:03] reagon_plays: i kinda know what you talking about now maaaaan
[0:27:10] onix146: yeah i understand
[0:27:14] epic_smee: the issue is it says 6 BTC i guess.
[0:27:24] gostonko: mhm
[0:27:36] Zardete: Isn't the equivalent is hitting the screen to make the computer work? KEKW
[0:27:36] 911_raj: What

[0:29:00] harucanne: So the gpu racks is overheated lmao
[0:29:01] numb3r13: time to watercool everything
[0:29:03] quasarptolemy: could you say something like you wrote the manufacturer...? feels like bug reports shouldn't be off-limits
[0:29:03] santilloo88: Demoted nidasNidasThinking
[0:29:24] brutalmoineau: peepoHey

[0:29:44] Eku007: Wasn't the heating all in weed room ?

[0:31:22] meego0o: can always check other houses
[0:31:27] steynthedork: nice mechanic maybe to get groups working together. one group does crypto, other group does weed etc since it will be harder to do both.
[0:31:32] gostonko: lookUp
[0:31:33] JackLDN27: Prayge

[0:34:10] swankytiger942221: Did you figure out the btc?
[0:34:12] ObamaBinDroning: hello boss, hope you're doin well nidasAha
[0:34:28] epic_smee: crypto will be worth very little anyways at some point, because everyone is decked out or not.
[0:34:33] Lum_O: did Dex find out how much is bill for house energy?
[0:34:37] Suvaacc: isnt humidity % tho not same plain value as others

[0:35:40] swankytiger942221: Someone? Lmao
[0:35:52] epic_smee: funny, i skipped through some streams today. and there was a lot of stuff people just figured out. there were a lot of hidden mechanics apparently.
[0:35:58] dyll3: Dhead pov NOBODY  PAYS ME RAGEY
[0:36:07] Dentvis: WHAT the car still here
[0:36:21] santilloo88: Its new right?

[0:36:26] epic_smee: ye
[0:36:27] tolluu: mhm
[0:36:35] santilloo88: Projecting nidasNODDERS
[0:36:36] reagon_plays: i mean for 3 days it was not working then you got to know
[0:36:45] swankytiger942221: Wait was the butcoin or a problem with the house?
[0:37:06] Suvaacc: yeah but a lot of things also have been scuff, that doesnt help
[0:37:07] dyll3: oop
[0:37:08] Zardete: I think it's good to report regardless because it allows the devs to check if it works as intended or not regardless
[0:37:10] PantherVlll: it's just weird it would tell you it is mining at a rate it isnt
[0:37:10] swankytiger942221: What was the problem then?
[0:37:19] gostonko: guys dont meta today im too tired for mod work
[0:37:20] Fishnet83: @Nidas so did you figure out what exactly was wrong with the buttcoins? Hmm may have missed that convo
[0:37:20] epic_smee: @swankytiger942221 heating
[0:37:20] Eku007: @swankytiger942221 Heating
[0:37:24] LePtitGrec75: to be honest the overheating was mentioned in some meeting with the group
[0:37:32] swankytiger942221: Thats kinda what I figured.
[0:37:32] Dentvis: it was obtuse to figure out
[0:37:39] thajollypirate: becomes weird when the ui tells you it mines 6 a day
[0:37:47] JackLDN27: Poor GPUs had been cooling off of the NDK fumes
[0:38:00] reagon_plays: it should have shown 2 butc per day instead of 6
[0:38:03] santilloo88: Im a watching 4head? nidasRLY
[0:38:04] z1f3D: With GPU overheating, it makes sense, I wrote to you about this assumption yesterday. Just like in real life, if the hardware is overheating, it lowers frequencies
[0:38:13] santilloo88: nidasHaHAA
[0:38:13] zuckscalulator: daaaaamn
[0:38:15] swankytiger942221: Like no one else had that problem so it was just something going on at the house
[0:38:18] zuckscalulator: ak got tham money
[0:38:29] AdanTheEpiphany: should be a way to tell its overheating
[0:38:33] Fishnet83: WeirdStare Stew
[0:38:48] santilloo88: Tru tru!
[0:38:48] reagon_plays: it should have shown 2 butc per day instead of 6 󠀀

[0:39:11] ObamaBinDroning: peepoStir Stew
[0:39:16] Dentvis: ye
[0:39:18] sharky_00_: YEP
[0:39:23] muskin6: Putting air conditioner near racks will also makes sense but as u said it does not show if its heated
[0:39:28] reagon_plays: then you know for a certain that it is not a bug
[0:39:33] soupy420: yeah an expected output would make it mucheasier to tweak your setup
[0:39:36] Celascion: the weed rack issue has also been solved right?
[0:39:48] IKEA_DOG: Yeah that's fair, then again running a rig in the sahara would make sense that it still overheats with fans
[0:39:56] LePtitGrec75: @reagon_plays the pc detects the graphic cards not the actual performance. What he is trying to explain is, if the character could feel the actual temperature of the room they would have assume faster that it was an issue of temperature
[0:39:59] swankytiger942221: Exactly.
[0:40:18] Fishnet83: investors limeCheck
[0:40:21] gostonko: IKEA_DOG ye my fancooled servers get hot in summer in Australia KEKW

[0:40:40] swankytiger942221: @nidas So so did you get the computer stuff figured out or did you find out outside of game
[0:40:48] yeslewd: also high chance of a raid

[0:41:26] Sylverphyre: Lovemore is new at least
[0:41:33] xl__8s: it has been really interesting how the devs introduce new formulas and code for you guys to solve
[0:41:39] sharky_00_: I mean, you did bring it up in the meeting.
[0:41:48] swankytiger942221: @meego0o yeah. He brings in someone new every couple days
[0:41:52] reagon_plays: like azazel
[0:41:54] swankytiger942221: Lmao

[3:43:02] pukuotukas666: Yeah, these subathons are like bmws, shit for 30 years people still buy it
[3:43:13] Silverheart59: I would only subathon to my favorite streamer, Nidas (tm) :)
[3:43:18] Absolutzer0_v2: Ill take it one layer deeper, is a hot tub stream really a stream when its 6 hours of "Changing into a new bikini" and the streamer doesnt appear?
[3:43:20] nellballs: I don't even think it's longer streams cuz he's just addicted to RP and would do it anyways
[3:43:25] col_malone: @pukuotukas666 LUL
[3:43:27] IKEA_DOG: It's interesting that it's really only RP streamers that do those kinda subathons
[3:43:38] timbres: @absolutzer0_v2 What’s a hot tub stream?
[3:43:48] Absolutzer0_v2: @timbres monkaEyes
[3:43:53] Dentvis: @IKEA_DOG trihex has had a subathon going on for like 3 months now
[3:43:54] ELEGlGGLE: overinvested viewers
[3:43:56] ELEGlGGLE: KEKHeim
[3:43:57] Ziimms: just dont sub to a streamer so he has to stream more for ad revenue =  longer streams
[3:43:59] Silverheart59: @Absolutzer0_v2 I see you're an Amoranth connoisseur
[3:44:00] yeslewd: uncapped subathons not an rp only thing
[3:44:04] Aravant25: people like to binge watch things
[3:44:04] pukuotukas666: @IKEA_DOG only rp viewers dumb enough to fall for that maybe
[3:44:07] yeslewd: they are everywhere
[3:44:11] iithum12: cus its content the whole time they stream, not just every now and then
[3:44:13] AdanTheEpiphany: u get more of the person over a long period of time in city is the idea i guess
[3:44:14] senlash: peepoS
[3:44:16] SeniorBunk: that was impressive
[3:44:20] jjjammi123: Cant hate it when he does 17-20h streams even if he sleeps in between.
[3:44:20] nellballs: Idk sometimes it feels like scamming a child but oh well
[3:44:30] Absolutzer0_v2: In the tarkov community people have done swapping stream subathons, where one person is on for 12, then they show the screen of the other person, so its always live content, just split between two people on different accounts
[3:44:36] gostonko: Happyge 'rested my eyes' for 30 seconds when nidas went to the bathroom and paid the price for it
[3:44:38] timbres: Insurance scam D:

[3:44:50] senlash: old man stonko
[3:44:50] IKEA_DOG: I mean I kinda get it cuz the streamers do go for quite a lot longer than they usually go for when they do a "subathon" even if they still stop streaming when sleeping
[3:44:51] punishedkai: gostonko

[3:47:22] Denwopp: 4head should do a reverse subathon where the timer decreases for every sub. I bet that would work

[4:51:32] AdanTheEpiphany: if u did a max rep weed run at 3.0 paid like 55k a run

[5:01:35] Sylverphyre: The area is still pretty damn big tho
[5:01:39] Xpatrol: need to learn the boundary
[5:01:42] AdanTheEpiphany: yeah i wish they moved turf half a meter into the street
[5:02:11] snitchellrobinson: its good that its not too big. you guys could catch others if they are selling on the turf easier
[5:02:20] Sylverphyre: Could literally fit 10 sellers spread out all over even and keep lookout
[5:03:04] Eku007: PausersHype
[5:03:45] AdanTheEpiphany: i think it takes actual locals not spawning in
[5:03:50] Sylverphyre: I'd imagine that may be the case if you're all concentrated
[5:04:05] bluoxxboi: So how is the rep going with vagos pushing down here too?
[5:04:33] benmaui: @bluoxxboi will probably be better once pushing the strain

[5:06:22] bluoxxboi: Pepelaugh
[5:06:30] xflame404: @benmaui after the extra process added , yeah
[5:06:36] Sylverphyre: Do Besties and Vagos have presence to sell during NA storm as well?
[5:06:38] Absolutzer0_v2: Look at AK on the block
[5:06:45] bluoxxboi: So just waiting for it to dry then?
[5:07:09] benmaui: @xflame404 even before that, hell way too many steps for that, the sewer run was bad enough, then they added the money run, and now this lol
[5:07:25] xflame404: so the big rack dry faster or not?
[5:07:31] xflame404: @benmaui yeah
[5:07:52] Eku007: Too many people selling ??
[5:08:15] Sylverphyre: Maybe having other ppl on app increase it? Regardless if they selling or not?
[5:08:54] Ererior: im selling too
[5:08:59] Eku007: Could just be that at night this area has too much foot traffic.. NPC's spawn at night
[5:09:37] Sylverphyre: I recall seeing a huge amount of traffic when a bunch of Vagos and besties were chilling here
[5:09:42] ItsDerfo: dumpsters spawning when 4head runs classic
[5:09:56] benmaui: he didn't recognize you haha

[5:20:31] Eku007: nidasAha
[5:21:20] Sylverphyre: Other sellers could accidentally be selling to your dudes, 4head kept intercepting and selling to Mings I think at one point
[5:21:24] ELEGlGGLE: i mean u dont think normal people sleep in the night??? HUH
[5:22:14] meego0o: i mean i work daytime and buy nighttime. so
[5:22:27] epic_smee: Yep
[5:22:51] Sylverphyre: Is there variance of what you get different times of day?

[5:24:22] Absolutzer0_v2: @FideICastro_ LMAO
[5:24:50] Sylverphyre: Wish we could find out if different strains etc conflict one another, gotta wait for Vagos further down the road
[5:25:56] Zardete: What do the percentages mean on that screen?
[5:26:00] LePtitGrec75: maybe when you will be selling your strain the turf will be better for customers
[5:26:31] Absolutzer0_v2: I still like the idea of establishing up in Sandy
[5:26:39] Sylverphyre: The turf seller had 10 listed
[5:27:31] ZerZom: 9 not 10
[5:27:48] Sylverphyre: Lil Seoul was mentioned, and it isn't in the HQ app
[5:28:29] Zardete: 4T monkaW
[5:29:30] ptvgrjbdr: Using vagos to get the strain at 100 and then dipping is the play for sure
[5:29:49] idea_guy: good morning plajas
[5:30:21] AdanTheEpiphany: vagos probs keep rep with the npc even if u move right?
[5:30:22] luckerooni: feels like the best route for that is to train someone up yourself
[5:30:24] idea_guy: that could be a good hustle, contracting out as a master seller
[5:30:44] Sylverphyre: I think problem is also them having to be on the app, which unlocks other stuff too right?
[5:31:25] idea_guy: Nidas someone in Harry's chat last night recommended your stream for people wanting to watch EU grinding
[5:31:47] keikobeans: progress could maybe give a grow house, that could be cool
[5:31:49] Yourah7: do the weed contacts work yet?

[5:32:17] AdanTheEpiphany: how long would it take to get hdd with hq app for vagos maybe sell?
[5:32:17] idea_guy: I think it was Cuppa but not 100%
[5:32:17] LePtitGrec75: well i guess you will need more butcoin now
[5:32:21] Eku007: @idea_guy Sounds like cuppa PEPW
[5:32:40] mariuspure: Hey I come here from Harry's stream, got mentioned grindas ? is this the right sream ?
[5:32:42] Sylverphyre: Are there any other "bestie" type group worth allying with to hold another turf together like what you have with Vagos?
[5:32:48] xflame404: @AdanTheEpiphany they can buy butcoin mhm
[5:32:48] Zardete: 4T keep walking by monkaS

[6:02:24] dreaminghappy: what does toggling the alert for cops do?
[6:02:34] Eku007: @Xpatrol Not % most probably.
[6:02:47] epic_smee: i know the percentages IRL but this is not capped at 100
[6:02:59] Xpatrol: @Xpatrol there is % on the humidity icon
[6:03:08] meego0o: levi maybe
[6:03:15] StreamElements: Don't forget to resub Ogey https://www.twitch.tv/subs/nidas
[6:03:42] epic_smee: @Xpatrol oohhh yes, maybe humidity is %. then it could be the same as irl

[6:06:20] kreljos: phone volume seems a little high, or maybe its his mic
[6:06:23] JoeKsova: I feel like this isn’t being scienced probably. a lot of tinkering in so little time
[6:07:40] Fishnet83: PepoG hmmm
[6:07:52] Dentvis: peepoTalk maybe
[6:08:03] Zardete: Just put everything on 69
[6:08:12] Aptness: I think it's gonna be tough with so many different types of operations happening under one roof
[6:08:15] meego0o: i dont think anyone has a plan
[6:09:04] mariuspure: just ask chat gpt Kappa
[6:10:00] zzZoolex: doesnt weed need to be in a cool and dry place
[6:10:14] esab: with no humidity
[6:10:15] deusregia: Wouldnt you want to reduce humidity?  Humidity means more water in the air which is counterproductive to drying
[6:10:20] gurglet: @zzZoolex this is a game, not real life
[6:10:46] Xpatrol: @gurglet Dev could take irl value
[6:10:58] zzZoolex: @gurglet yeah i get that, i just don't know what's been tried yet by different groups
[6:11:04] Llcoolweas: adding humidity to dry is not logical but it's a made up system in a game so who knows
[6:11:05] deusregia: More cooling for GPU racks,  more dehumidifiers to dry weed faster and ventilation for everything.
[6:11:12] Waron_: actual weed drying shoudl take 60-70% say couple of websites anyways
[6:11:16] JoeKsova: humidity could be one of those bait variable s
[6:11:40] epic_smee: @Waron_ back in my days it was 50-60
[6:11:44] meego0o: nothydra
[6:11:48] meego0o: LUL
[6:11:57] kreljos: Fbi about to investigate this channel with everyone googling how to dry weed
[6:12:14] Fishnet83: classic dex
[6:12:40] JoeKsova: play might be to take plant from the same grow and dry them in separate locations and see what factors affect the most. keeping others at 0
[6:12:50] zuckscalulator: @Nidas maybe heat for drying money?
[6:12:56] JoeKsova: one plant in each apartment
[6:13:05] zuckscalulator: heat seems so useless
[6:13:15] EryXinc: my guess is racks add heat but doesnt add it to the panel, i.e needs trial and error compensation
[6:13:32] Yosamita: seems like heat should be coming all the electronics
[6:14:17] Erandiel: 10 variables equation system PepoG
[6:14:18] Absolutzer0_v2: 2 houses, one for BUTC (cold) one for Weed (Warm). Take over sandy market. Profit.
[6:14:27] iZeeMo: Did you check In ?
[6:14:49] JoeKsova: 4head can tinker with cooling, another can tinker with ventilation
[6:15:08] JoeKsova: big rack science can come in later tbh one the base science is figured out
[6:15:30] avonwg: are u guys factoring in how ice cold AK is? that could be directly influencing it
[6:15:58] mariuspure: all the ice is cooling down the house when ak enters frfr

[6:16:57] Fishnet83: mhm smart

[6:25:22] blakfalt: he's missing a lot the additional costs that would bring him closer to the $75k he's talking about
[6:25:31] enar_ixo: He can easily do G6 with Dez next tsunami
[6:25:35] NemisizZ: its the 4head curse

[6:25:52] blakfalt: at least you all are progressing
[6:25:53] idea_guy: Webster family just isn't built to make money
[6:26:08] wadebyjamesjuh: I think "grinding" g6 with Dez will make the group progress very fast
[6:26:17] gurglet: trav would still complain even if he had figures in front of him. That is just trav Shrug
