[4:54:42] warner05: He tries to RUSH SO HARD
[4:54:42] Xen_Crypt: not sure
[4:54:43] DannyL3tscher: cause he wanted to say he was jaywalking there too probably, which would be stacking I think?
[4:54:45] THE_Palmer1452: Den forgets how to exist when you put him in court
[4:54:46] Phindrius: It's Dean, he's got a habit of throwing KEKW

[4:54:48] oscar_n_t: he was trying to get to the threats bit i think
[4:54:49] Piggens: no because he jay walked as they were chasing him
[4:54:53] Grimzzly3D: Well u can't walk on the freeway either so that's multiple jaywalking
[4:54:54] Connorbrow: It makes so much sense that Cornwood thinks so highly of Den LUL

[4:55:08] 1coopdog2: so he literally is just doing this because of jaywalking?
[4:55:10] oscar_n_t: so if he only pled guilty to j walking there would be no trial?
[4:55:10] jacksmithcje: i mean criminal threats wont land cos of den comment so they g=may get jaywalked off too
[4:55:10] Gachiguru: dean gotta slow down when doing these

[4:55:25] Chickenplucker26: But don't forget Cornwood gave judge Adams a j walking charge
[4:55:25] Piggens: right he was trying to get two counts so one sticks I thinki

[8:48:06] Fozy15: FirstTimeChatter HOLY
[8:48:07] Rastafiki: i think NVL is generally used to make people give up and be a hostage when someone gets the jump on you and holds the person up. instead of just pulling their own gun out.
[8:48:07] ArdentCause: @Meatshyld im at 77k rn but i stay using it haha
[8:48:07] DrWetbone: going to snr buns is def nvl

[8:48:45] spicyville: I mean every time you make a jump with a car is NVL but that shit is WICKED
[8:48:46] RoadwarriorTV: !gamble all
[8:48:46] azmer1987: No one cares unless its a cop
[8:48:48] Atokad2887: its also bad RP if your shot 10 times but your alive the next day. in all honestly gta rp should be hardcore
[8:48:48] iMoore_: ems always cartoon characters LUL
[8:48:48] PZ17leafs: or James Randall jumping off roofs
[8:48:48] Loco_Cubano: so like I dunno if there are a situations for forced perma here like execution for murder but if such a thing exists than so long as the intent is to survive and get away anything they do to accomplish that would be okay as far as NVL goes
[8:48:48] Titantrace1: cornwood grinding the rails
[8:48:49] ShadowedSeraphim: @EsfandTV Isn't NVL more of a "Player Interaction Etiquette"
[8:48:49] JustChelsay: so, NVL is so subjective then which is frustrating
[8:48:50] Meatshyld: @SpookyMcGucci just a guy who wears pants and has a cat on my lap
[8:48:53] SkyeReaper: well tbh, your driving isnt really in the rules either but you know its lax in some places haha
[8:48:53] cboys41: NVL is like someone jumping from a heli with no parachute to a rooftop to abuse a position in a gun fight type deal
[8:48:56] icephrogg: watch where im going
[8:49:00] sevenevilmuffins: playing a game on top of a giant crane thing with a bunch of clowns is NVL
[8:49:00] goodtimes54: @ArtificialHelix they can you just have to interact with them the rule is pretty much you cant kill without some sort of interaction /communication first
[8:49:00] TheKingOfWit: Wouldn't being a cop automatically be NVL since it's so dangerous
[8:49:03] xxlonegunmanxx: NVL is being in an RP situation and dying because you refuse to lose the situation.
[8:49:04] Utschig: true nvl would make everyone a civ working a normal job lol

[8:49:50] vizzyvee005: just a vr headset
[8:49:51] DenizenOfTheVoid: get him to the choppa
[8:49:52] jdickson93: probably just because it effects cops more with what they can do so it comes up more in cop streams
[8:49:52] SwisherStreamz: I think anything you do rp wise on here is gonna be levels above others because it isn‚Äôt what they all do or do well imo

[8:50:29] DieterK: where are u going
[8:50:29] azmer1987: Cheer100 because you can't spike because locals, can't pit because locals, can't shoot unless clear background. The impression is criminals run over 5 locals and cry you spiked and risked a locals life

[13:38:09] SkyeReaper: He showed a clip of his first shift in 3.0 and he literally gunned down a random player that was likely an innocent bystander and that was with prompting from officers over radio; I think they didnt want to start off rough. Look up more 3.0 videos, its kinda crazy.
[13:38:12] tanostangy: there is no way that cops are ever going to be able to get anything done agenst the crims with these rules i think it just evades the rp because the crims would just power game there way out every time hopefully it gets better with future legistlation/commisioner

[13:39:09] tyrlsxx: I feel like if he tried to flip the car then he is involved at that point
[13:39:16] detergent86: yeah it feels like crims get to min max and police get the lamest set of judges to determine what they can or cannot min max

[13:40:11] FaramirRat: why would someone run into a crime scene

[13:40:27] Strangemitts: pepper water pistols
[13:40:28] Thatipe: o7
[13:40:30] Bluntblower_508: If someone doesn't comply and they're trying to instigate the situation, then it deserves usage of a taser. They could've injured all parties including themselves.
[13:40:32] xxx_SIG_xxx: ain‚Äôt no way just ain‚Äôt no way
[13:40:32] thesmoogers: If they weren't involved, why would they take the car?
[13:40:34] Clodhoppr: thats called a dumbass not staying away from an active scene

[13:40:39] Fluffy54605: @FaramirRat many reasons, distraction probably
[13:40:40] BradleyKalani: i mean... if he walks into the crime scene he becomes involved
[13:40:41] yourfavoritekoala: some libtard policing
[13:40:41] detergent86: it‚Äôs night and day different game when watching police streams vs crims in the gaming aspect
[13:40:43] AbeFroman2: you guys act like they couldnt have tackled him while he ran 15ft to them
[13:40:44] bitscit: you must be certain
[13:40:44] TikiSmash: every meeting with these captains feels like a socratic seminar
[13:40:46] Potato_Nation19: "It had 2 legs, 2 arms, was walking upright and held a gun" .... damn thats not enoufh
[13:40:50] krispytuesday: Woke police force
[13:40:50] Bluntblower_508: Yes
[13:40:51] lazerstarz: was he driving the car when they tried to flip it
[13:40:54] gymleaderphil: why does that matter he hopped in the car and multiple cops were telling him to get out
[13:40:55] SmugPls: so just let them all take the cars LUL
[13:40:56] OGpicklehead: you have to wait until they've incapacitated you lol
[13:40:57] Pakkasparkers: he stole evidence (the car) commonsense would say he deserves to be tazed
[13:41:02] sevenevilmuffins: real life someone runs into an active crime scene like that, theyre getting yeeted by the cops
[13:41:04] frack3r: we need a vigilante arc
[13:41:06] WarrenPuffit: @tikismash LMAOOO SO TRUE
[13:41:06] HeyMeghan: @lazerstarz nope. totally different guy
[13:41:07] MaNSoN6649: Yeah what if you shoot the wrong guy AppaK
[13:41:08] KnightyGaming: esfandCOPS TakingNotes
[13:41:09] Michael__C: too many rules, just become a dirty cop
[13:41:10] EvilCoatrack: so they can keep ramming whatever they want as long as they don't leave the vehicle.  you can't tackle a car, so as long as they don't get out you can't do anything to them?
[13:41:13] rake0: @Pakkasparkers they mean before he stole the car
[13:41:13] taraannee: wait im actually confused? is he saying you cant shoot just bc he wasnt originally involved? im lost lol
[13:41:15] ProVenomX: that dude said " i'm going to take this car " LUL
[13:41:16] Drackaine: this RP around balancing is super weird, because the comparison is with RL logics, in RL guy would have been shot
[13:41:17] OGpicklehead: oh shit that guy was a threat... while you're on the ground
[13:41:23] unclebeug: need some cuff guns handcuff someone while in pursuit LUL
[13:41:24] Sizzlaa: lol
[13:41:24] M__Wolfe: Guess I'll just die then captain
[13:41:26] AnnoyedWithChat: Might as well just keep shouting at people and letting them get away LUL
[13:41:27] AbeFroman2: he drove off instantly, he had KEYS
[13:41:29] LostNomNom: Man PD is super weak. Geezus
[13:41:32] ThatBigBoyIsaac: what can you prove even though you dont have the resources to prove anything KEKW
[13:41:33] DPTDave: if they weren't previously involved, suddenly ramming MAKES them involved then
[13:41:33] tanostangy: so the car isnt a deadly weapon running up on multiple officers in the middle of a crime scene stealing a car dont you dare look at him this is litterly insane XD
[13:41:34] Clodhoppr: this is an active scene
[13:41:34] MarvMelody: turner must be corrupt
[13:41:35] SharkzGG_: @Drackaine RP shouldn't really be compared with IRL
[13:41:35] Ravionus: he made himself involved when coming into a crime scene and disobey direct orders to stay back and charging to enter the vehicle that was full of contraband
[13:41:35] oofinside: xdd
[13:41:36] Auron089: as soon as he runs in he is involved
[13:41:37] Gulkai: That the person run up to police scene
[13:41:37] Roxxitensai: so many things could go wrong IRL and ingame by playing it say and by the T with rules.
[13:41:38] Karper69: this red tape sucks
[13:41:38] gilg__: @Drackaine escalation and levels of force is absolutely a RL concept
[13:41:38] pikachutheferret: Turner should be a lawyer instead
[13:41:41] sevenevilmuffins: real life that guy is shot dead 10 out of 10 times
[13:41:42] Cowlowries: brotha, i can 100% write it up and justify any use of force used in that scenario
[13:41:42] DatDudeLARKIN: @DPTDave Yea, I don't think it matters if they were initially involved or not, if you're dumb enough to run into an active scene and start ramming cars, you don't need to be behind that car either.
[13:41:43] AquaBruh: you cant shoot stupid people cornwood
[13:41:44] JustinBeaver_: PD is run by liberal snowflakes
[13:41:46] FiFO915: Basically they can just call their homies to come pick u up TF
[13:41:46] TheRealTweex: Ain't no way any PD would just let someone run into an active crime scene
[13:41:46] modooc56: did anyone even run the plates?
[13:41:47] Takyon_: @Drackaine not if protocol was followed
[13:41:47] scootypebbles92: chat malding af lol
[13:41:47] OGpicklehead: the cop's rules of engagement are nonsense
[13:41:48] AbeFroman2: he had keys esfand
[13:41:48] TheMah1337: Sometimes it doesn't always have to be by the book when certain circumstances come about
[13:41:49] MarvMelody: Turner must be corrupt ReallyMad
[13:41:50] blahder: How do you tackle someone in a car
[13:41:50] Sizzlaa: fun adventures esfandFlick
[13:41:51] OATmilked_: someone running people over is lethal escalation OkaygeWow
[13:41:51] SleiFever: Yea but how the hell do you deal with it
[13:41:54] MaNSoN6649: He was just chillin, not him AppaK
[13:41:55] bombkey4: this is soooo libbb
[13:41:56] zorahul: he is right,
[13:41:56] DezalbM: lawyer rp has hurt pd bad but if it has to be so be it
[13:41:56] afghanpsycho: lawyer has been waiting half an hour outside now
[13:42:00] superdave0603: ummm ü§î
[13:42:00] DrewDabski: THEY SHOT A GUN
[13:42:01] detergent86: if you run from police and they stop you vehicle they violently remove you with massive force and halfway beat the shit outta ya while getting cuffed. in this game you just beg crims to let you arrest em
[13:42:02] tyrlsxx: If they are running on to a crime scene and you gave them a warning and they continue then they involved at that point
[13:42:03] sevenevilmuffins: theyre stricter than real life cops lol
[13:42:04] bennybennybooboo: i never comment on other peoples RP, but i think he needs a broader scope of using a taser. he is asking too much to be examined at one time.
[13:42:04] havocgrimreaper: The car ramming is force though
[13:42:04] DrewDabski: THATS FORCE
[13:42:04] Switchblade142: Turner's just trying to RP what the current rules for nopixel are chat
[13:42:04] Lordrune13: he had keys Cornwood
[13:42:05] Evsta99: OMEGALUL YOU NEED TO BE SMART AND SHOOT THE GUY WHO IS RAMMING HIS CAR INTO ANOTHER CAR WITHA HALF DEAD SUSPECT
[13:42:05] wolfhall113: @Drackaine Yeah for sure, in the end it's just enforcing server rules so everyone can have fun with the RP. People keep thinking of it as IRL situations instead of a game
[13:42:05] alienngecko: he ran directly towards them and messed with the scene and took the car which is evidence, he also had keys to the car bc he immediately drove off
[13:42:06] ChainOfLightning: if you feel threatened, use the taser
[13:42:06] Jrey000: real life these people would be shot and also arrested after wards LULW
[13:42:07] Eggyo1: Crim life is the way to go
[13:42:07] KnightyGaming: criminals are dumb in Los Santos kekw
[13:42:07] Zeynlol: police are literally a meme in 4.0
[13:42:08] Pakkasparkers: so crims can just steal crime scene evidence?
[13:42:08] miketwng: there's nothing you can do in that scenario without 77's
[13:42:09] xplayer55555: in court too
[13:42:09] bigtex494: Crystal ball maybe
[13:42:10] axelfrOst2o0o: Chatting
[13:42:11] EsmanTV: This is where the RP on this server goes so far away from reality LULW
[13:42:11] AbeFroman2: he had keys he drove off isntantly!
[13:42:13] def_75: fuck this, release several moutain lions in Snr Buns in protest
[13:42:13] DrewDabski: YES
[13:42:14] BradleyKalani: I am giving turner the benefit of the doubt that he wants cornwood to be confident about his choices and to explain himself
[13:42:14] Bluntblower_508: He potential tried to remove the vehicle from the scene. Then was successful afterwards
[13:42:19] SmugPls: so we just let them take the car and thats it, Thats the only outcome @EsfandTV
[13:42:21] Grilbur: This kinda just confirms that crims are in full control of every situation, they decide how everything happens
[13:42:22] oofinside: Waiting rue went offline
[13:42:22] uneik: so chat this guy is a troll right
[13:42:22] Bluntblower_508: Potentially *
[13:42:22] AquaBruh: you can't deal with it because in GTA it all happens in 5 seconds where as in real life it takes much lolnger to get into a car and drive off
[13:42:23] GloriousGlutton: argue feeling in danger?
[13:42:29] Toluen090: But you can't prove it is the same person
[13:42:31] MrTouge: Ah yes, a person with keys to the vehicle is def not involved esfandPains esfandPains esfandPains
[13:42:32] Vlasvilneous: They jumped in and started the car right away, they had keys
[13:42:32] Drackaine: @wolfhall113 pretty much
[13:42:33] GorSTL: seems like they just know they aren't going to get shot. The dude even said "Just going to take this here" and drove away
[13:42:33] EsmanTV: Committed GTA in GTA 5Head
[13:42:36] Sizzlaa: the chief is alright, he thinks logical
[13:42:39] FiFO915: might as well have nerf guns
[13:42:39] MaNSoN6649: Omg
[13:42:42] ADub187: @esmantv this isn't suppose to be realistic. That's the point of rp. To get away from reality
[13:42:42] TheMrGromble: 4.0 cops are just let the crims win and watch
[13:42:43] my69thaccount: u can‚Äôt compare real life to rp. it‚Äôs not about winning everytime
[13:42:44] DreamDipity: trust cornwood you will remember this lesson many days down your path.
[13:42:46] TimeFlex1: He stole the car....
[13:42:46] AnnoyedWithChat: Why shoot when you can just ask a question LUL
[13:42:47] AquaBruh: he is thinking in the court of law

[13:42:48] Sizzlaa: lol
[13:42:49] clubfed11: remember CHAT this is RP
[13:42:50] miketwng: we couldnt
[13:42:50] Clodhoppr: he's being devils advocate i get it but yeah
[13:42:51] vxcant: Turner tryna not get his officers dapped EZ
[13:42:57] bluej255: yup gotta prove, otherwise fails in court and bad guy gets away
[13:42:59] nabstonekido: Yeah it came in trying to flip the car
[13:42:59] Leafyerick: PD has their balls in a vice
[13:43:00] alienngecko: bruh
[13:43:01] DrWetbone: these police rules aren‚Äôt in place to stop criminals, they are there to win court cases with 100% certainty.
[13:43:02] OATmilked_: LULW
[13:43:02] Kev_Prime: if this dude was my co irl wed be getting his ass removed so fast
[13:43:02] ADub187: RP> IRL
[13:43:03] FiFO915: @EsfandTV its just toooo one sided my bad
[13:43:03] OGpicklehead: you cant know that in the moment
[13:43:04] doobae: it's rp, no feelings hurt
[13:43:04] havocgrimreaper: The body cam with car endangerment is proof
[13:43:04] BopSC2: Do they ever review bodycam footage as a team?
[13:43:05] Ragmuena: As funny as this is in comparison to real life he is coming from a good place and its good RP
[13:43:08] SlimTDC: Turner is being the voice of server admins in discussions like this. annoying but thats the deals
[13:43:10] MaNSoN6649: LUL LUL LUL
[13:43:12] chickenwienersoup: you can't use nerf guns you can poke your eye out with the projectiles
[13:43:14] AnnoyedWithChat: Vote a new captain in
[13:43:14] EmilTuT: Turner is right tho if u cant prove it the judge will just let em go again
[13:43:14] Sizzlaa: berriyaDevil good movie
[13:43:15] KnightyGaming: NODDERS
[13:43:15] Luthercorpz: I see Turners perspective. It's typical with all the other seasons at this stage I've seen before an they are trying to beat this style into pd
[13:43:15] Vlasvilneous: He had the KEYS!
[13:43:15] Jrey000: thta is dumb af LULw
[13:43:16] Kingbunsz: bro he stole the car in from of 3 cops after ramming the vehicle LOL
[13:43:16] TikiSmash: this is why y'all need a DA/prosecutor
[13:43:16] xxvampxx: bruh
[13:43:16] Lordrune13: he had keys holy shit
[13:43:17] Aphotice: feel like taser should be fair game on the dude that ran up and took the car
[13:43:18] zorahul: a judge would agree if it went that way
[13:43:18] newtricksterx: holy shit 0 leeway with cops this patch
[13:43:19] RobbieGZ23: word of the day is articulate
[13:43:19] Kev_Prime: turner clown
[13:43:20] Roxxitensai: hes not saying NO, hes saying if you can justify your actions, youre good
[13:43:20] Bonafideone: turner does have a point
[13:43:20] superdave0603: huh?
[13:43:21] VaeVictisATL: He sounds like a defense attorney, not a captain concerned with his officers or civilian's safety
[13:43:21] willietrom: chat, the point is not to get the "moral" result, it's to follow standard operating procedures
[13:43:22] Potato_Nation19: No i get where hes coming from, old gvmnt musta got RLY bad or this just doesnt make any sense
[13:43:22] Fig336: dash cam
[13:43:23] ToxiccLadd: the way the PD works right now you cant act on hunches at all
[13:43:24] SkyeReaper: @slatt5 exactly, 4.0 just started, we gotta start somewhere before escalating
[13:43:24] complexlalo: He has a point it‚Äôs not what you know but what you can prove.
[13:43:25] sirfilly: bro was driving circles around yall
[13:43:26] OGpicklehead: if someone is inserting themselves in the moment in a sus manner you need to go on instinct
[13:43:26] guztawo: esfand accent
[13:43:27] timtheboneman: I can prove there won't be any cops soon lol
[13:43:27] hereforff9: ultimately he's right but its definitely lame to see somebody roll up and roll out so casually
[13:43:29] KnightyGaming: sniffthenewchatter
[13:43:30] BradleyKalani: Turner's literally looking out for them if you're listening to what he's saying.
[13:43:31] ssdccb: Turner is wayyyy off on this one
[13:43:31] HAYNEZz: if it goes to court hes right
[13:43:31] VenatusVox: Need CCTV in game lol
[13:43:32] lgnashevich: hopefully they have more features/mechs to help with proving these
[13:43:32] EPiQ: @SlimTDC also the law. Lots of criminals IRL get off of crimes if it cant be proved.
[13:43:32] FuZroK: as long as you can explain it to a judge, then you good
[13:43:33] Strangemitts: basically what Turner is saying is that you should have tackled that guy
[13:43:34] Clodhoppr: true he had keys to drive off with it
[13:43:34] AquaBruh: nah its not about no balls or balls in vice its about being able to prove your actions were reasonable in the court of law because you just shot someone
[13:43:35] zekonja17: turner is just being a judge in this situation
[13:43:35] DiscretionaI: Had keys to drive the flipped vehicle
[13:43:38] FatalSpade: is the lawyer still waiting for cornwood? lol
[13:43:38] slatt5: @bluej255 at least u get to waste their time though LUL
[13:43:38] miketwng: @EsfandTV he had keysss
[13:43:40] wispamii: this is why Tanner is my least favorite captain.
[13:43:41] Grilbur: So annoying all the chatters saying it's just rp, when all this bs is running half the rp situations
[13:43:44] Twill923: i thought you were talking about the individual running into a crime scene and STEALING evidence?
[13:43:45] mootywooty: his point is there is a difference between knowing and being able to prove something in a court of law
[13:43:46] Switchblade142: @VaeVictisATL he is just RPing the server rules, he's not the one making them it's from the admins but he's just saying that in RP
[13:43:47] Bluntblower_508: I cant wait till my ass has a p.c. Im hopping in this game as lawyer for the police. This is fucked up lmao.
[13:43:47] detergent86: yeah the field officers need a union the captains have no power over
[13:43:50] Twill923: taze his ass lol wtf
[13:43:51] ninjadeej: Gotta be Elliot Ness out here to arrest a mfer
[13:43:53] tr1pl3_z: It doesn't even make good rp tho, not being able to do anything is boring to watch.
[13:43:54] afghanpsycho: @fatalspade yes
[13:43:54] SmugPls: a senior buns gun walking along on the street aint gunna just run up and be like 'Sorry just gunna take this car' Theres no way they arent involved
[13:43:54] StreamElements: @esfandtv üí≤ #RedBall just donated $5.00: I. THink. I. Need. a. Redbull. Ah. Heres. One. Let. Me. Take. Some. Gulps. Guhm. Guhm. Guhm. Guhm. Ah I feel so much better but i think ill have some more i need energy im still kinda grogy. Guhm. Guhm. Guhm. Guhm.

[13:44:03] alienngecko: lol I get that it‚Äôs rp but I feel like they‚Äôve been asking/answering the same questions for like 10 straight mins now
[13:44:04] SharkzGG_: @hereforff9 3 officers and nobody thought to tackle, he got out casually because the cops only thought was "do i shoot"
[13:44:05] ben_v_art: PepoG
[13:44:06] OATmilked_: Hmm so running people over accidentally is okay
[13:44:06] Marthentic: you taze them and then continue the investigation. You feared for your life
[13:44:08] briggins: wait is the captain a real cop?
[13:44:09] blahder: How do you tackle someone in a car
[13:44:10] chickenwienersoup: can you prove there weren't keys already in the car
[13:44:12] Roxxitensai: Turner is basically trying to prevent a court case 3 days from now, where all teh charges get dropped.
[13:44:13] Kingbunsz: Its stupid because every crim can just do w.e they want since cops are so soft
[13:44:14] arkitekt22: My brother-in-law is a Sergeant and he was tellin me a similar story the other day about hearsay and shit like that, seems frustrating lol
[13:44:14] Motaavation: How can he have keys if not involved
[13:44:14] oofinside: Waiting great point
[13:44:20] OGpicklehead: cops have no power right now
[13:44:20] zellitan: -$5
[13:44:20] Bluntblower_508: Im good on being very p.c
[13:44:21] Motaavation: Accessory
[13:44:21] Kev_Prime: turner has no point hes a desk jockey justifying threat to cops is extremely easy cops were hit by a car already. Non lethal is authorized.
[13:44:22] KaisenSiru: anniesWrite anniesWrite
[13:44:22] Waycaps: -1 ?
[13:44:24] JustinBeaver_: lol

[14:01:14] taraannee: @illuminat4242 oh i agree but it also depends on the city, the suspect, and the cops

[14:01:28] Wallsh_: ask for statements in report
[14:01:38] Chris_Collabs: @taraannee depends on where you live and a lot of other things. my hometown cops are cool as fuck honestly. genuinely serving and protecting. don't get me wrong, I fucking hate cops but, they arent all bad, just stupid

[14:04:08] illuminat4242: @Strangemitts just saying what I have noticed no need to have an attitude
[14:04:11] wolfhall113: @illuminat4242 @MalcolmAndHarley You two haven't seen the video of the cop who shot that guy in the hotel when the guy was begging for his life and following conflicting orders. Don't be so naive
[14:04:12] oofinside: YEP
[14:04:13] Capn_Stew: That's the life of a cop
[14:04:13] superdave0603: irl the cops in my city are great. it depends on the department the city and the state you live in. There are bad cops but I‚Äôve met some great cops too
[14:04:14] ltl_wackman: NODDERS yea kinda restrictive
[14:04:16] FaramirRat: Living off Energy drinks and Chips, no wonder Cornwood is 300lbs

[14:04:23] TurningTheFrogsGay: just taze everyone
[14:04:23] vicious_pen: Well On top of that Esfand yours is worse because of your cuffs issue too
[14:04:24] shadzjr: it makes sense, but some of the restrictions are too restrictive
[14:04:24] SharkzGG_: I mean yeah, cops have more rules than regular people
[14:04:27] shwaayyy: for real. cops have to have rules
[14:04:29] Bluntblower_508: They love talking on the radio like a sexy truck driver lol

[14:04:42] RaisedByTigers: snackies
[14:04:42] 42arc: huge learning curve
[14:04:43] SaintEcho: def gonna be frustrating sometimes but the rest of the time cop rp is super fun so worth
[14:04:44] Chris_Collabs: @illuminat4242 you're not wrong for not poking the guy with the gun but it shouldn't be like that. cops get called on misconduct constantly
[14:04:45] Twill923: only thing he was off about was the tasing thing
[14:04:46] AbeFroman2: cops have lots of rules, more news at 12
[14:04:48] willietrom: yeah, the limits makes everything so situational that you need training for more situations, literally no cadets know cornroll
[14:04:49] tanostangy: i agree with it execpt with the car part with them ramming the car
[14:04:49] Sulm: It honestly just feels like bad RP from a lot of crims. They just go in there and ignore any threat a cop would pose
[14:04:52] Twill923: you could literally just tase him
[14:04:55] vxcant: creates more friction = RP
[14:04:56] Clodhoppr: thats basically NVL
[14:04:58] EvilCoatrack: and the cops literally cannot shoot, so keeping running is metagaming
[14:05:01] SkyeReaper: Yeah, work up over time as 4.0 builds

[14:05:50] aF1eRLiFe: @illuminat4242 You're correct, bro. Don't pay attention to the losers.
[14:05:55] Xierany: The worst thing about it is how unrealistic it is for crims to get rammed 50 times, get picked up, run in the middle of cops aiming, almost like the cops don't exist

[14:07:39] superdave0603: lol
[14:07:40] Mogvvai4Sale: Hmm üçü
[14:07:44] Mechz71: Yeah throw the SOPs back at them and when crims start to get away more and more, hopefully they change SOPs
[14:07:46] PsychoJoker: Turner can talk to the nopixel people about it and ssaab knows about it he's slacks. They are working on fixing his cuffs
[14:07:49] SkyeReaper: its like you get to 1 star wanted level right now, at most 2 star wanted, but eventually as things progress and there are more officers, youll be able to go all the way.
[14:07:58] ben_v_art: frfr According to the SOP we owe them $500 and a piece of candy
[14:07:59] Aphotice: maybe it was just bad rp on the crim end being outnumbered at gunpoint and not putting hands up?
[14:08:00] KnightyGaming: DoritosChip jaysLick
[14:08:01] Leafyerick: @EsfandTV The fucked part is a crim can just bust into a scene like that which is unrealistic and at worst they get a few hours timeout whereas if you make one decision that others feel was wrong you get a 60 day mark on your record
[14:08:04] iJerrBear: I think his cuff problem stems to his Ped Model, but who knows

[14:09:08] Odensmile: lol
[14:09:09] Xierany: @Xierany Ofc it does. If you have a knife to your neck or a gun to your head, NVL is important. Issue is crims don't care about guns like they do knives
