[1:34:45] h3naz: itll help handling but decrease top speed
[1:34:45] jcraig21_: better handling
[1:34:47] SurelyBaked: spoilers are for keeping you connected with the ground, not making you go fast xdd (don’t tell that to the Hondas in my neighborhood though)
[1:34:48] DaHub: in real life yea but in rp.
[1:34:49] shosher: More air resistance on the speed. That's why cars have the moving spoiler
[1:34:50] Silvertap: I should make it faster yes
[1:34:55] slatt5: spoiler shouldn't do that unless its a front wheel drive car
[1:34:55] catfish_quackenbush: Real life, spoilers at more down force but it will take a little top end as it's adding more drag

[1:38:28] th3manag3r_HD: @EsfandTV if it spreads down your spine it will likely be a disc-nerve issue! get it checked out

[1:52:42] Lordofstarfall: lookUp
[1:52:42] starshadowx2: just cut your neck off, you don't need it anyways
[1:52:42] PatrickMaybe: @norimicry if he’s got a slipped disk than a chiropractor is the last person he should see OMEGALUL
[1:52:46] M1sterRZ: How much does an mri in us cost?

[1:52:58] charburger69: Tried standing and walking
[1:53:00] munchkiin_: yea you should really rest up your neck, Esfand
[1:53:05] SurelyBaked: when you sit straight up it causes everything to compress in your neck which won’t feel good when you have a disc issue which is why learning back makes you feel a little relief (actual medical experience here)
[1:53:08] imSteffin: imagine you went to a chiro and they just yoinked your neck and it cut your spinal chord has that ever happened? monkaa

[1:53:14] Mr_Antisocial: Is it stress related
[1:53:18] MrVitch: Could you add a function that shortens your hearing distance on command?
[1:53:21] ShhLackEe: should get neck sling
[1:53:22] resonantblip: limitation fosters creativity
[1:53:23] TexanRampage92: Odd question have you thought of getting lesser quality headphones for this game because you may be hearing to much due to the headphones?
[1:53:23] EhBud: If its a herniated disk in your back or neck I wish you nothing good things I've dealt with both and it's fkin horrible
[1:53:25] finalfork: Chatting ill tell him how to fix his neck
[1:53:25] Tokki_Foolz: It makes you change your perspective
[1:53:27] SoLDiER510: Wait is he still in jail
[1:53:27] norimicry: @PatrickMaybe exactly. shouldn't see a fake doctor for anything tbh

[1:53:46] kointoss88: toxic chatters who make their whole identity around being a chatter?
[1:53:46] Dontthinkson: Dumb hoppers more upset than the streamer.
[1:53:46] Bill_Collector: Ff7 soon I can feel it
[1:53:47] Gundaree: @EdibleBoxers rofl only problem if it is wrong diagnose who to sue?

[1:53:51] JasonMunday: RP seems kinda miserable lately
[1:53:52] Lordofstarfall: CG Hoppers Classic
[1:53:53] munchkiin_: @EdibleBoxers American insurance too expensive tbh.
[1:53:53] charburger69: Suspended and being able to walk around and interact with people is very different to prison. If nobody came to prison yesterday it would of been shit for him
[1:53:53] sircrumpler: esfandL esfandL esfandL esfandL esfandL
[1:53:55] bigpharmaa: GETALIFE do what i say or i sick mr k on u
[1:53:55] McAze: spoiler NOPERS not over it
[1:53:55] Kolipto: Ban more people from chat. IMO
[1:53:56] smokiew: maybe a one day break might be good
[1:53:58] JustinBeaver_: @bill_collector maybe tomorrow
[1:53:59] lawlkat: he never says it back
[1:53:59] deadbyhunting: I don't think he's over it
[1:54:00] callmefive: this too shall pass
[1:54:00] EdibleBoxers: @Gundaree @EsfandTV
[1:54:03] Dawnsaan: i mean ur reaction right now is what they wanted.......just say fk them
[1:54:03] BeerRun204: Try blue emu, It worked for me and it doesn't smell
[1:54:04] crab_fisher: i mean alot of ppl just watch you for cornwood
[1:54:05] suzzanne___: Cheer1000 love you cornwood
[1:54:05] TheNotoriousKEV: @JasonMunday the RP is fine, its all the OOC bullshit outside it imo
[1:54:06] theshoover: I've always said 98% of issues in RP is because of chat.
[1:54:06] devlin0221: @charburger69 Than he shouldn
[1:54:06] Usahi_Light: kebun's a good dude his chat messages are just like 90% ass, its not even just "a few bad apples" lol
[1:54:06] nippynoodles: @matanzlatan2000 I'm confused as well
[1:54:10] M1sterRZ: @shae__void damn, so it can be pretty expensive huh?
[1:54:11] GGusMaximus: can you wear hats yet
[1:54:13] Gundaree: @EdibleBoxers good one that is a safe bet
[1:54:13] devlin0221: @charburger69 Than he shouldnt have done the crime?
[1:54:14] counttolstoy: @charburger69 yeah ok but they did
[1:54:14] Tokki_Foolz: Imagine that was XQC omfg lol
[1:54:14] kylef_: lookUp
[1:54:15] jayden192962: it’s not all cg hoppers rameeFeels
[1:54:16] chibishimaa: the server needs to balance some things. i think crims are doing what they can and cops are doing what they can
[1:54:16] Landoram: did you leave Aziz?
[1:54:17] frodowitz: Wishing you the best bud. You got a few good viewers here that appreciate you :)
[1:54:18] Gio_Dtavio: @charburger69 cry more pussy
[1:54:20] TheLadyCupcake: https://clips.twitch.tv/CuteDoubtfulSpindleVoHiYo-p2VAMEK_ELTHx-1D did you see this already
[1:54:21] kylef_: lookUp 󠀀
[1:54:23] acarr94: I will say you tried to do the right thing with the case, but once he heard the initial time of 1400 be blurt out your process you do of showing all charges in his eyes now just appears as CW adding charges ect. It was mainly on the other cops who wouldnt chill and let you tally up the charges.
[1:54:28] ThatDashGuy: AAAAA-FLACC
[1:54:28] neft39157: @esfandtv you should take a one day break from streaming to clear your head. gotta take care of yourself too
[1:54:28] boomershow824: Kebun and XQC are the only RP streamers who have enough viewers where hoppers affect u
[1:54:29] Snup78: do you think no headset for a couple of days could help the neck pain ?
[1:54:30] charburger69: Stating the obvious
[1:54:31] FelipeLLs: essaying
[1:54:31] boGrral: monkaS chatters fighting
[1:54:32] TenderPantyz: GETALIFE i take 3 shits a day minimum. think about it
[1:54:33] FelipeLLs: essaying
[1:54:35] Kolipto: Good guy Esfand
[1:54:39] bigpharmaa: @Gio_Dtavio my strimmer is suffering
[1:54:41] FelipeLLs: Sludge
[1:54:43] omn___i: @jasonmunday I think esfand trying to stream through neck pain makes it seem that way LULDUBYA
[1:54:43] shawnatron85: I think it all worked out really well in the end and that you did  your best. I'm a "hopper" that supports you both to the fullest.
[1:54:44] shaddydaddyo: Gio_Dtavio  relax brother
[1:54:46] kylef_: Chatting
[1:54:46] Budsworth1: Cheers Sadge i feel that
[1:54:49] Cthyllah: oooookaaayy chat lets not just bring everything up again, just watch the damn stream
[1:54:49] manwod_77: As a person with 3 herniated discs from football.. I feel your pain, brother... it sucks that there isn't an easy fix. I have been enjoying the rp. Keep up the great work.
[1:54:50] charburger69: LOL
[1:54:51] FelipeLLs: Pain
[1:54:51] slumgator96: Dont take in character people being mad for out of character being mad
[1:54:52] iamBLEEPP: If you're hopping to cause trouble.. please get help because that is not a healthy behavior
[1:54:52] madhatterui: it's also a bunch of chatters projecting their own problems on the characters
[1:54:54] shae__void: @m1sterrz i had one a few years ago and WITH insurance it was about $500 Sadge
[1:54:55] FelipeLLs: Pain neck
[1:54:56] Ceebz89: Sludge nymnCorn
[1:54:57] StupidPlainName: Maybe you should take the day off, or personal health is important to, physical and mental.
[1:54:59] JasonMunday: GETALIFE break your neck even harder
[1:55:00] MrBASins: ESFAND AS FOR YOUR PAIN CAN YOU TAKE MUSCLE MEDICATION OR ACTEL PUCHER AS ACTEL PAUCHER WORKS AMAZING
[1:55:02] coco_villa: ts!t
[1:55:02] boomershow824: Your viewership doubled during the K situation and most of those people were hoppers
[1:55:02] SMFTwistedSMF: It may get to point when you interact with more known streamer or situations like yesterday, Might have to just immediately switch to sub mode or emote mode. Thats the only time I see this stuff happens.
[1:55:04] bigpharmaa: HOLY essaying
[1:55:04] PsychoJoker: @unic0rnhunter if he does that then it will make chat even worse, They will say hes hiding from Mr K doing what hes gonna do or not do. Its best to just play it out and try and make the best outta it. The Chat hoppers are the most annoying people though
[1:55:05] EdibleBoxers: cause ppl think acting a character = irl feelings OMEGALAUGHING
[1:55:07] coco_villa: !tts
[1:55:07] StreamElements: @coco_villa, $3 for custom TTS or $1 for default Brian voice. Check the TTS guide: tts.monster/esfandtv
[1:55:07] theshoover: It's the "Streamer's Friend" theory. The streamer is friends with the person but not chat, so they get extra aggro when an argument happens between friends.
[1:55:07] bigpharmaa: HOLY essaying 󠀀
[1:55:08] FelipeLLs: essaying
[1:55:09] Kaseyfullofjoy: @Ceebz89 XD <3
[1:55:10] Usahi_Light: @charburger69 it's Mr. K/Kebun, no one's gonna leave him alone in jail lol
[1:55:10] devlin0221: @EsfandTV Are you excited for the next season of NFL to start?
[1:55:10] YegaPega: they aint your friends, they just pretend to be your friend because they want you to let them win
[1:55:11] FelipeLLs: essaying
[1:55:12] JustinBeaver_: @madhatterui ur thinking too deep lol
[1:55:12] Jomik: parasocial andys stram hopping to hate on a streamer's friend on their behalf is so cringe
[1:55:13] SurelyBaked: the streamers themselves are good peeps but they don’t regulate their chatters at all so they go out and cause a bunch of chaos. no way your viewers are out there being as toxic as those peeps are. it’s about moderation.
[1:55:14] Sadisticmedic: cohhChatting
[1:55:15] FelipeLLs: essaying
[1:55:16] callmefive: can’t be an NPC
[1:55:16] SoLDiER510: Thats crazy bro
[1:55:16] itsmeJmac: essaying
[1:55:18] Miterex: it’s wild to the about the psychology behind it. chat is a bizarre experience
[1:55:19] kylef_: ReallyMad esfand is malicious
[1:55:19] Bushwick78: ikr
[1:55:19] RawToon_: A week from now no one will remember
[1:55:20] Amo_Zzz: Esfand has no malice ever
[1:55:20] flocular: you're viewers probably do the same shit @EsfandTV no reason to feel bad
[1:55:22] neft39157: he talking about dumbass hopes
[1:55:23] FelipeLLs: essaying
[1:55:23] TheNotoriousKEV: people thikn because your characters are on different sides that you guys are like at each others throats, its dumb
[1:55:23] sjb8450: sjb8450 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! !commands
[1:55:24] Connorbrow: @madhatterui So it's my fault Cornwood has a tiny weenie?
[1:55:24] 13nox__: @TheLadyCupcake lol poor den
[1:55:28] Techno_Plumber: The vocal minority
[1:55:28] TheNachoManRandyCabbage: chat is wayyyy to invested
[1:55:29] lilbuddy__: Madden when Sadge
[1:55:30] suzzanne___: no we know you haven't it is a game
[1:55:30] Wandering_Ranger: chat, he was throwing up his entire stomach and siobhan had to force him to end stream, he ain't taking a day off LUL
[1:55:31] frodowitz: They're not real viewers, fuck those basement dwellers dude
[1:55:32] ncs_310: they don’t understand the different between character and streamer because most streamers just play themselves
[1:55:32] unic0rnhunter: @unic0rnhunter yeah, but thats normal in the gta rp scene tbh.
[1:55:32] acarr94: A wise man once said " Some people suck"
[1:55:35] Usahi_Light: yeah their chat isnt regulated at all, look at that shit for 5 minutes and its almost all negative stuff
[1:55:35] munchkiin_: I noticed that for people that trust someone its easy to create characters that are rivals or something, and the fact trhat people think of it ooc, it's funny
[1:55:36] igazadvandavid: heyyo @EsfandTV  how's your neck ?
[1:55:36] TheMrGromble: NOWAYING YOU'RE NOT CORNWOOD

[5:23:28] oioioibruv: its A CAR
[5:23:29] Usahi_Light: @ens0mniac Yes, swinging at the car to damage it until he has to get out or explode in it
[5:23:30] condor2104: @MoistMouthMags Most cases Tazers do not work, we have seen many examples.
[5:23:31] callmefive: civilians are not protected also needs to be reimbursement for civilian in the charges
[5:23:31] itsjamesjx: I love you Esfand. But this time you're wrong

[5:23:35] ExoticMeats: You don't know the story your assuming too much
[5:23:38] Archangel3003: @Map_Of_Your_Head They should lay out the red carpet for crims. Maybe give them a police escort away from other cops. Hell stop and get out and fix their car if they crash in a chase as well.
[5:23:39] Gundaree: they hit the car to get to the civs, they were not mad at the car lol

[5:24:04] deanm182: swinging wrench’s. threatening to beat down. lives are in danger. should be allowed to shoot. otherwise may as well have a toy gun cuz they have guns pointed and just run away like it’s nothing

[5:24:08] OprahSideMan: @esfandtv your taking the law part to seriously , think about how upset the other person would be getting shot
[5:24:11] zuperman270: ever heard of bullshit 911 calls lol
[5:24:14] cjohno20: most "civs" do crime. they just also use PD to do their dirty work
[5:24:15] ens0mniac: I’m normally with Esfand on a lot of stuff, but jumping straight to shooting when someone’s life isn’t immediately in danger is crazy
[5:24:15] lord_odin93: @EsfandTV Two questions. Are you going to play Helldivers II (AKA Starshiptroopers) :) and FF7 Rebirth after the current plot comes to an end?
[5:24:16] Juggerit: @Usahi_Light Yes then every one does rat strats and Instant shoots the Civs to rob them and shit lol. Then PD cries they arent giving RP. Max force is just 3.0 all over again and didnt work
[5:24:18] Skylo97: theres and argument to be made that the car could explode if beaten enough but i think tazer is appropriate
[5:24:21] johnnytruel0ve: i saw a cop tackle mehdi without saying a word to him then immediately tazed him after

[5:24:44] TheCombatantWombat: One important fact you guys are missing is that, 1 person was swinging at the car but the other one was swinging at the driver's door
[5:24:45] i3oondock: bro your instinct as an RP cop should not to be to shoot first talk later regardless of the situation
[5:24:45] DieterK: attach to the chase?
[5:24:48] SpeedrunGreg: i got banned in mizkifs chat for bullshit i've been following since 2018
[5:24:49] Usahi_Light: @Juggerit max for when it's called for is different than max force in every instance. they're trying to kill the man inside it dude
[5:24:49] MarexDS: @ens0mniac but someone's life was in danger
[5:24:50] firedreworweriot: what is happening

[5:25:00] Ryaht: tbf, Tylers put himself in that position, if they saw him i mean
[5:25:01] Wallsh_: well u stopped them.  you prevented the crime
[5:25:03] eliteone11: America shoot first America ask questions America later America
[5:25:09] johnnytruel0ve: @eliteone11 right...
[5:25:10] Rastafiki: speculation though...
[5:25:11] Tyler_Flaunty: What did I miss?
[5:25:11] Archangel3003: @Map_Of_Your_Head Saying they shouldn't go in guns blazing while two guys are beating the shit out of a civs car and yelling for him to get out. If they just point the guns at them and tell them to stop or they will shoot then the crims will just run off knowing they won't likely shoot as they're suppose to let crims get away
[5:25:12] cjohno20: SCHIZO
[5:25:13] brettydoes: they wanted the tape bc he was recording no?

[5:25:18] ziib: hitting the car breaks the car...
[5:25:18] Neekapkilla: Lol that is DEFINITELY what Cornwood would think, so +1
[5:25:19] blahder: I think PD take their guns our too often instead of a taser and night stick.  Because police always pull out their gun before they can actually use it.  Then they fail to actually disable the crim because they have to swap from their gun to a less than lethal
[5:25:19] ULTRAKona_: @SpeedrunGreg OKEY
[5:25:20] Gundaree: @Wallsh_ it doesnt stop there, catch the criminals is part of it
[5:25:21] Paudelly: This is like do you shoot the guy trying to break down your front door. No one gives a shit about the door, its about what the guy is doing, trying to get to the person
[5:25:22] taffletv: that is a lot of speculation
[5:25:25] WayILive: wouldnt it make more sense they were going for the tape
[5:25:25] Switchblade142: i just got here what's chat whining about now
[5:25:26] OprahSideMan: you stopped the crime , no need to shoot at that point

[5:25:36] johnny_killmore: @yungtokyow I literally watched they wanted him to stop filming.......
[5:25:36] Map_Of_Your_Head: @Archangel3003 the police have to respond with corresponding force, just because criminals are bashign a car doesnt mean you can just shoot them OMEGALUL

[5:25:39] Rastafiki: they disabled the car... how would they get the turbo out.
[5:25:39] Juggerit: @Usahi_Light He is literally saying MAX force everytime when crim against Civs. Thats just muddying the line to Ruin RP
[5:25:45] KhrisOsaurus: KKonaW shoot on sight KKonaW

[5:26:17] Wallsh_: @Gundaree they didn't let them walk.  he crashed his car and they got away

[5:26:54] condor2104: @brettydoes TRUE!
[5:26:57] Map_Of_Your_Head: @Archangel3003 i am... not sure what im missing. appropriate force. the guy in the cars life is not as in danger as the criminals life if you shot them. period LUL
[5:27:00] Codex88: his life was not in immediate danger so shooting him would not be warranted
[5:27:00] JustinBeaver_: @whaleblast they do
[5:27:00] RexPappa: Ruth caused all of this
[5:27:01] RoboticToy: @EsfandTV You can taser though right?
[5:27:04] Gundaree: @Wallsh_ well you are saying they should let him walk after they stopped hitting and preventing them from taking the car....att least when caught jail prevents them a while from doing it again?
[5:27:05] cjohno20: the long-term consequences of increasing force will be worse for civs. Crims will be shoot first talk later imo

[5:27:09] THE_WONDER_PETS: I mean you at least put effort into it. I feel like I would appreciate that more than anything
[5:27:19] spicyville: it’s a crime against other people. those people are RPing as well. more force should be used because those people are feeling the stress of the situation as well
[5:27:21] Wallsh_: TBF u stopped the crime by being there at all.  not really as bad as your making it out to be @EsfandTV
[5:27:21] do1f: I just got back why is the police car cambered?

[5:27:37] ActuallySupremacy: esfenL any non-subs?
[5:27:37] quadmommyy: it’s definitely reasonable to deploy taser much sooner than what’s in place, especially with more than one criminal at the scene and against a civilian, it’s something that crims can easily get out of and still have a good rp
[5:27:38] condor2104: @Faisallu LOl imagine

[5:28:26] Archangel3003: @Map_Of_Your_Head So if they got the guy out of the car then they would have just apologized to him and let him walk away? No they would have beat him. But sure they should just pull up and politely ask them to stop violently beating the shit out of a car trying to get to a person and then let them get in thier car to drive off

[5:54:28] CrystalDimension: @Silvertap why, what happened ?
[5:54:30] tbowfoshow: Aziz was there and heard cau threaten and swing at the guy. obviously he is going to be upset about it because bloods on his hands
[5:54:30] Maz0hyst: Aziz is fucking locked in

[5:55:54] tbowfoshow: Aziz probably pretty sad about DAP possibly
[5:56:00] Gundaree: @Xierany you can defend your own property but this was rage not defending should have let the cops handling it
[5:56:03] CrystalDimension: @Silvertap did he have Cau as a ride-along?
[5:56:05] tagoor_ad: hia all
[5:56:07] OutofRightField: @WarrenPuffit Letter of the law LULW
[5:56:08] Usahi_Light: @WarrenPuffit It's not hard to know the laws of a fictional city when you watch a cop and there's literally pretend-lawyer streams lol
[5:56:15] Nultez: @Silvertap @Silvertap he missed so it can be argued that cau tried to break his car to not make them drive away.... Cau didnt hit them
[5:56:16] rzocys0: its litteraly felony obstruction, letter of the law him like everyone else EZ
[5:56:21] macklax: @PsychoJoker Don't forget PT's

[5:56:36] akhil1827: @OutofRightField that only applies for CG
[5:56:37] MakingMischiefs: Nah chat cau shouldnt of done anything should of stayed in the car, now aziz potentially facing daps and getting fired
[5:56:38] RexPappa: If its up to Slacks hes fired, if its up to Beric hes suspended
[5:56:42] PappaMidNight: Ducaning
[5:56:43] Silvertap: @CrystalDimension Yes, kind of, they got him from a scene of robery and chase the crim

[5:57:07] Pee_aRe: but that not illegal
[5:57:09] Switchblade142: @MakingMischiefs He only has 5 daps, at most Aziz would get 1 but I doubt even that.
[5:57:11] CrystalDimension: @Silvertap oh so he was a victim first ?
[5:57:17] Silvertap: @Nultez Idk, i think this argument is weak...
[5:57:17] Gachiguru: towing a plane Classic
[5:57:19] Superior_Warrior: he had intention
[5:57:20] Gundaree: @RexPappa doesnt work like that, if it is a dap he is suspended as of 10 daps then they have a hearing about being fired or not but no instant firing
[5:57:22] Xierany: @Gundaree IRL yes, not in LS though. You can only defend yourself with lethal force to defend yourself or others. But yes, should've let the cops handle it
[5:57:25] fishnchips333: @darkblad3s unlikely. in 4.0 seems legistaltion is very very slow at changing
[5:57:26] sugreff: intent
[5:57:26] Rivath: But is he still standing his ground when Cau runs?

[5:57:40] taraannee: many ppl dont realize assault includes ATTEMPT it doesnt matter if u succeed in hitting them
[5:57:41] TheLastRace: @EsfandTV it isnt Illegal is it?
[5:57:44] akhil1827: essaying
[5:57:47] Silvertap: @CrystalDimension In another scene, but he stroke first in the actual scene
[5:57:48] LordKain73: Victim is now being charged....welcome to los santos
[5:57:50] StrawHatDan13: by bringing him you put another person in danger basically? is that what hes saying?
[5:57:52] Superior_Warrior: bonked KappaPride
[5:57:52] peepopeaches: @CrystalDimension His car was stolen, Cornwood drove up & told him to get in while they pursued. CW got out later & Aziz took over driving, then it went to shit
[5:57:55] Nultez: @Silvertap it is not that weak... his car was getting stolen... so him breaking his car so they cant use it is reasonable
[5:58:05] johnny_killmore: @Korrupted___ Cornwood is literally defending a criminal as we speak
[5:58:06] Usahi_Light: kekw
[5:58:13] ZachFromChat: That actually changes it entirely if the other guy attacked after he was disabled
[5:58:19] IdipsuTV: so you were told?

[5:58:20] AngeloJulius: Susge not not told

[5:58:24] im_Nando: just say you were trying to disable your car kekw
[5:58:25] rzocys0: if someone swings a cop they are shot down, even if they run away
[5:58:30] konkous: Actually that is a good point
[5:58:31] jeffrey778: darn this sucks for every one
[5:58:33] Nultez: @AngeloJulius not told to not do that

[5:58:52] RexPappa: @Gundaree Well suspended before fired, but they fired Johnson, fired Den and they were going to fire Cwood if it wasnt for the Mayor
[5:58:53] CrystalDimension: @peepopeaches I see. It's not gonna be bad, Chief will understand
[5:58:54] johnny_killmore: @Korrupted___ are you not watching???
[5:58:54] akhil1827: isnt this is the same case when someone tries to save their friend and cops beat them with baton
[5:58:55] Silvertap: @Nultez What u are sugesting is distorting the thruth and this pd DOESN'T WANT TO BE LIER, THEY WANT INTEGRITY, SO THEY WON'T LIE
[5:58:59] Gundaree: @Xierany well this had nothing to do with defending property he attacked and went to them...he could have denfended when the car was taken (althoguh I did not know you cannot defend property as it happens constantly)
[5:58:59] Aledz_: damn he losing his voice
[5:59:00] AngeloJulius: @Nultez Susge i understand what you're saying
[5:59:01] Korrupted___: @johnny_killmore Are you?

[5:59:26] Gachiguru: @MysticaIly nobody
[5:59:28] johnny_killmore: @Korrupted___ yes Cauu got out and attacked someone...

[5:59:43] sendemup: yeah but, deadass?
[5:59:47] RexPappa: And Beric was the one that brought then back as a PPO, if it were up to the OG high command he would have gone through academy again
[5:59:48] Billdozeh: but you didn’t haha
[5:59:51] adamg46: defusing this guy is like trying to put the pin back in a grenade

[5:59:55] RexPappa: Den*
[5:59:57] 55Hoes: @faroeislands_ tru
[5:59:58] Nultez: @Silvertap exactly, so if they persue charges on cau they are just ruining their relationship with the civilians
[5:59:59] Korrupted___: @johnny_killmore Yes, they are discussing this rn
[6:00:01] docterstrange_: now aziz will be suspend Sadge

[6:00:36] spicyville: cornwood knowing the laws BASED
[6:00:39] Usahi_Light: mf was a getaway driver for heists
[6:00:39] Silvertap: @Nultez The problem is not prosecution, is the internal investigal for improper conduct - for Aziz
[6:00:42] OutofRightField: @Gachiguru "civ" LULW
[6:00:42] cuspeli: YEP
[6:00:44] cleptoxxx1: So has any cop thought of putting like a barrier to stop them from jumping into the prison ??? I wouldve thought someone wouldve thought of it cut ppl off from going in.
[6:00:44] Moregorilla: He could get in trouble and cops could get in bad trouble
[6:00:48] MysticaIly: @Gachiguru forsure, but he was still assaulted and responded leading to him being shot multiple times. Sorry, im not trying to like be a law nerd or anything lmao, but I am actually curious as to if there are any legal issues that could arise against either party here
[6:00:48] yourdadow: how many daps can cornwood take as ppo?

[6:01:20] Gundaree: @RexPappa true first one was different but Den and Cletus got a hearing that indeed was suppose to fire them both...but lets see what happens. Not sure doing nothing no charge is the right thing a senior officer might see it as cover up...if they get away with it aziz maybe too....better just doing the right thing which is your job.
[6:01:20] chillaxinvibes: ahhh i thought assault was saying you were going to do something to someone, and battery was actually doing it
[6:01:24] yourdadow: so cornwood can take the dap for aziz no?
[6:01:26] Berserake: Ruined it for everyone else

[6:02:20] Aledz_: Duncaning
[6:02:21] Usahi_Light: @johnny_killmore The "letter of the law" is 100% out of context lol the context for that is during court. Charges are, for the most part, up to officer discretion
[6:02:22] Mindhysteria: @searlesbarkleyk yeh i dont think he can
[6:02:25] fishnchips333: @daedayz cornwood gotta main character first. give us 20 min lol

[6:03:21] Nultez: @Silvertap exactly my point, but nonetheless threatening cau with charges is not the way to go

[6:04:04] Codex88: cornwood is not in any trouple for this. it falls to aziz at the end sadly
[6:04:06] cleptoxxx1: Teue but the problem is the ppl getting in not out witch the pd can control both ways by a) blocking the jump b) waiting for them to get out it would be spread out operation but who close the gap of the flow not ruin it but to control it but ig they have bigger plans in the works
[6:04:09] bigpharmaa: dyat damn thats a fatty essaying
[6:04:10] Cthyllah: you guys have to remember that aziz is in a higher position than cornwood too, so he has more responsibility than he does
[6:04:10] HogballTV: they literally had them arrested idk why he acted dumb
[6:04:11] Usahi_Light: @moose_916_ Hiding it by....documenting his belongings and explaining what he did wrong?
[6:04:11] condor2104: this makes people not even call in crimes when they happen.

[6:05:14] Usahi_Light: @johnny_killmore literally talked to Mcnulty about it and he told aziz what he'd do and aziz agreed, he went to a senior officer
[6:05:17] Rastafiki: Aziz knew you let him in the car and didnt do anything. so its both your faults.
[6:05:20] Switchblade142: Don't think it's as as bad as people think. At most it's an improper procedure from Aziz/Corn.
[6:05:23] PacGamer: This chat kekw y'all are attacking each other more than they did in the game
[6:05:33] Nultez: @Silvertap he did commit a crime(assult), however what it will lead to is distrust, court case and alot of headache possible sues. Logically no one should be chharged and it should be held to persue for a later date.

[6:10:52] KaBoomGodTV: GETALIFE NO ITS MY FAULT
[6:10:53] OutofRightField: @blowaways "civ" wanted to play crim and disobey so everything is in flux. Aziz is choosing to get everything in line before charging since they have 30 days
[6:10:56] Gruntavius: @Archangel3003 facts, imagine being so out there that the streamer singles you out of 9k watchers
[6:11:01] just_james69: Wait so that fish and chips guy gets kicked out of saabs chat too, super sussy... Kappa
[6:11:07] alaterra: this sounds serious🥺
[6:11:09] TheMah1337: i feel like the fact that cau ran and the guy chased him to hit him takes away the self defense
[6:11:13] acetheplace456: console or pc?
[6:11:15] TheBusterScrugs: Cornword could learn from how aziz is handling this
[6:11:15] AndHaka54: yea but sadly good attention dont matter

[6:11:29] Gachiguru: @just_james69 its very easy to get banned in there to be honest
[6:11:30] Archangel3003: @TrippMinds Nah he hasn't fucked anything up for other civs I doubt. Cops just need to not have people jump in with them while in an active scene.
[6:11:33] Sweet_BabyJeebus: what if he used fist though? so no ride alongs?
[6:11:36] Shonuff_: ooh
[6:11:36] Usahi_Light: according to the LS constitution that's not what self defense is
[6:11:40] jordeon123: Aziz knows when to get serious YEP

[6:11:49] Jerti_: oof

[6:11:57] cjohno20: crims play "civ" and putting the PD in these predicaments is so hard to navigate. sows doubt/distrust
[6:12:01] greenburg22: @Gachiguru only if ur making stuff ooc or backseating or generally being annoying
[6:12:04] Dirtyriver: he got tased then struck by Chris on the ground but ya almost all true

[6:23:01] Top5Lels: @Usahi_Light bruh saying you feel bad 100 isnt planned. you make it seem like every manerism is intentional. This is a mentality character flaw towards situations you fuck up for someone else. irl or not. I dont really care for your take on my opinion. Enjoy your life my man
[6:23:05] wimdey: Cornwood fired for sure
[6:23:09] Usahi_Light: @johnny_killmore Yes and most other people on the server aren't robbing PD guns and shooting a bucnh of people with them and robbing sanitation workers for weeks in unwinnable situations and then carrying around said sun-temperature gun to do that crime

[7:50:14] bleiddyeah: it’s 80% Joey’s fault
[7:50:15] EsfandTV: @Ragestrike IQ
[7:50:15] kilimanjaroke: @kiyoni he asked the judge if if was possession, he didn't ask the judge if robbery and possession can be applied together since robbery as written covers possession
[7:50:19] soulinger: good evening chat esfandL
[7:50:19] ironpuft: Are y'all talking about Mr. K's sentence or whats RPing rn?
[7:50:22] infintitedream: “My stream lost”
[7:50:26] Miterex: @Ragestrike Because something happened on K's stream that validates chat's feelings.
[7:50:27] droksid00: A stack is literally what Cornwood did for fun early on with jaywalking. Getting them for evading and jaywalking. Or running red lights. That's stacking. Stacking is when you apply implied charges in ADDITION to the umbrella charge
[7:50:28] bigmatcomb0: why he typing???
[7:50:28] Ragestrike: K Town wouldnt of happened if RP didnt go this route so why are they even salty
[7:50:29] deafguy87: @soulinger, HOWDY
[7:50:29] eklu65: The real fumble was that the miscommunication was allowed to go on that long without clarification to Mr. K
[7:50:31] Haleos_x: Mr. K viewers really trying to take the crown of most toxic hoppers away from xqc hoppers
[7:50:31] k1nneDECIR: Good evening @soulinger . VoHiYo

[7:50:36] Gundaree: @ironpuft nah we are the ones that moved on
[7:50:38] wolfgang_86: people really wanna defend mr k
[7:50:38] davidayotte: slacks shouldn’t be in charge of anyone if he deals with cases like that… he was in the wrong and even a judhe said so… but he still tried to save kevin
[7:50:39] brude42: Rogue > paladin
[7:50:39] TheGodmother: @Haleos_x Shush
[7:50:41] Rastafiki: its not a stack. theres a reason why its two different charges. Robbery is a blanket for all other PD equipment. possession of a PD glock is a special charge FOR PD glocks. if Mr K was just trying to "disarm" cornwood and he never wanted to possess the gun, he would of never picked it up off the ground.
[7:50:41] Leafyerick: @kilimanjaroke He did ask the judge if they stack. The judge said they do not
[7:50:42] AngeloJulius: @devils_lettuce956 it's a minor shitshow

[7:51:03] thegummibearmassacre: Chief Beric GIGACHAD
[7:51:03] TheGodmother: @JakiemRevol ?
[7:51:06] espeiranza: it's not a stack you leterly can  rob and not possess and can possess but not rob, they have to separate the charges for that and charging him for both is not stacking stop stupidly arguing about it
[7:51:08] realpossible: @Rastafiki tbf it says weapons in the charge

[7:51:23] devils_lettuce956: @angelojulius did it just happen?&:&:
[7:51:23] droksid00: Based on chats stupid fucking logic, if you shoot and kill two people, it would be stacking to charge them with two counts of murder.
[7:51:27] Ragestrike: K Town wouldnt of happened if RP didnt go this route so why are they even salty lol
[7:51:28] surfawave: GIGACHAD THATS OUR CHIEF
[7:51:30] SumDee_LumDee: W Beric
[7:51:32] infintitedream: @espeiranza thank you.

[7:51:36] enser27: Can we for real just stop bringing up  the shit from the other night??? everytime its brought up chat turns into a dang shit show.

[7:54:57] Firehead94: @jwou11 I dont think its streamer size, its a matter of impactful influential character. He only has the audience because hes made a super impactful character with influence. There have been plenty of large streamers that have tried the RP thing and couldn't even attempt the K town thing much less come up with that idea

[7:55:16] eklu65: @rastafiki no, they're talking about before that moment. They wanted Aziz to drop him off at PD THEN head to moselys
[7:55:27] layla109: Daps are a necessary evil as much as people dislike it but there's a better approach to a situation to ensure officers are held to higher standard and we get to see how well the chiefs methods will work.
[7:55:29] rosegotu: Aziz is Rping to much to the letter of the law

[7:58:36] Wynter282: how is he saying its cau's fault when they stole his car lol
[7:58:36] scarydisk: Does the threat of shooting matter? Was that communicated in the radio?
[7:58:36] 55Hoes: Wrangler said it
[7:58:37] Vikairius: It was rooker threatening if the ramming continued
[7:58:38] SumDee_LumDee: rooker said if you ram us again we will shoot
[7:58:41] SimplyThisOne: Rooker
[7:58:42] callmefive: Aziz too emotional
[7:58:42] StrawHatDan13: so are you trying to justify the shooting?
[7:58:43] vicrocity2009: chris king did say that
[7:58:44] Brakon: @EsfandTV rooker said he was going to shoot if the car tried to ram you guys off roof
[7:58:45] PoisonDart11: the acorn said igt
[7:58:46] StreamElements: Join Esfand's discord! https://www.discord.gg/esfandtv
[7:58:47] xl_scout_lx: The officer said I will shoot you if you push me off this building @esfandtv
[7:58:48] NextEraGamer: In response to being rammed on the roof rooker said that
[7:58:48] rocker22_: Cornwood does need to do his statement
[7:58:50] thxmuhs: @johnnytruel0ve ur gonna be okay
[7:58:55] ImToreos: It was John Dongle
[7:58:57] Hunter9871: it was the officer with you who said that
[7:58:58] starshadowx2: the ghost of Sam Bass said it
[7:59:03] No_Choices: "if you ram again you will be shot" - officer
[7:59:04] Archangel3003: The guy in the car on the roof. Can't remember who it was.
[7:59:09] offbrand: I said it
[7:59:13] CrutonArt: put it all in the statement. hold onto it for now
[7:59:14] CrystalDimension: bus drifting in the background LUL
[7:59:15] surfawave: lack of communication mhm
[7:59:16] xJOKURv: Mr k said it ?
[7:59:17] starshadowx2: Svenson said it
[7:59:21] miketwng: jack Iawson? @offbrand
[7:59:23] johnnytruel0ve: @thxmuhs did i hit a nerve when i said reddit x52chaKEKW x52chaKEKW
[7:59:23] Neekapkilla: He wrenched Cao while Cao was tazered on the ground "self defense" lol
[7:59:24] devils_lettuce956: Aziz going to be roaming and preaching the street with Johnson soon LUL
[7:59:26] xRidd1er: has kit not been paying attention to this whole convo lol
[7:59:29] rosegotu: is Aziz trying to get the rwo of them dabbed
[7:59:43] MisterTroubleMaker: hmmMeeting
[7:59:45] jeffrey778: i remember it as well, could been the driver that jumped onto the freeway
[7:59:48] Rhinoplast: the initial carjacking preempts the suspect being unarmed and self defence
[7:59:48] Vikairius: Aziz believes only he did wrong
[7:59:49] knowlightnofear: Chief said let it be for now.....further conversation is unneeded and will dig a hole for officers on scene
[7:59:52] surfawave: do PPOs not need permission to use lethal on scene from a superior
[8:00:00] korporaal_langslang: There is a line for self defence. Cau swung at him yes but then Cau ran away. If Chris is running after someone chasing him and then beating him down that’s assault and no longer self defence @esfandtv
[8:00:05] callmefive: Chris was beating him while he was tazed
[8:00:10] csteele2020: @johnnytruel0ve Reddit is nothing but crim viewers like you crying that their crim they watch got arrested for shooting and kidnapping cops. so what’s your point?
[8:00:11] bigmatcomb0: this is crazy...
[8:00:16] coldbleb: Did Cau say they had a gun at any time?
[8:00:20] ItsYojimbo: it doesnt matter either way in the end
[8:00:23] RebornOffline: OOC Cau was running away with his back turned, so it's not self defence any more
[8:00:25] Amstadam: it was rooker because he rammed you both and then gave way then the driver drove off the roof onto the highway
[8:00:31] johnny_killmore: @coldbleb no a knife
[8:00:33] Rivath: @RebornOffline Correct
[8:00:33] Endor: @surfawave why would they
[8:00:35] Talker100: too much talking, the Chief already said it was ok
[8:00:37] callmefive: so if they didn’t shoot Chris then what
[8:00:39] ry__fly: It was self defence but he did steal his car in the first place.
[8:00:41] khrow: ok
[8:00:44] EdwardOn1: DANKIES 󠀀
[8:00:48] KhrisOsaurus: LULW
[8:00:49] xblasphemye: @csteele2020 when at the end of the day k town was amazing conentent anyway and  so what is the point of complaining?
[8:00:54] thxmuhs: either way u got the W fk em
[8:00:57] Ragestrike: its not self defense unless he calls the cop afterwards
[8:01:04] Augus9029: When's the PD VU event?
[8:01:05] cuspeli: Pointless it is what it is
[8:01:06] JustDrewOfficial: rooker said it on the roof
[8:01:08] Rivath: @ry__fly You can't claim self defense once they turn and flee. It was HIM assaulting Cau at that point
[8:01:10] agnosticbishops: Duncaning  let's talk about it a 3rd time
[8:01:10] ZuldeadTV: dankHug aziz
[8:01:23] Bill_Collector: He 100% should have been shot
[8:01:24] condor2104: cops didnt know that
[8:01:26] Metalcalfe: cau was running away saying I'm de escalating though
[8:01:30] Ragestrike: letter of the law cant claim self defense unless you call 911  after.  Check mate
[8:01:35] callmefive: cal was incapacitated from a taser and Chris was beating him
[8:01:38] knowlightnofear: But aziz brought him there..
[8:01:40] StrawHatDan13: 100 percent should of been shot after he downed cau i would think
[8:01:41] Wynter282: aziz is making it worse
[8:01:49] csteele2020: @xblasphemye right? like what is the point of defending a person ROLE PLAYING IN A VIDEO GAME who shoots cops and kidnaps them getting arrested? it seems like a mental disease
[8:01:50] Juiicer: Wasn't Cao defending his own property?
[8:01:55] blowaways: no, hes saying he shouldnt because it was delayed
[8:01:56] khrow: bruh
[8:01:57] deafguy87: hmmMeeting
[8:01:58] Bill_Collector: It was caus choice to get out and attack him
[8:01:58] Techno_Plumber: https://clips.twitch.tv/SeductiveLachrymosePidgeonKAPOW-OSJYvJezufdpvAN2 Rooker Said he'll shoot I believe
[8:02:02] cuspeli: just because its justified doesn't mean its legal
[8:02:03] Protomateria: @Juiicer thats not how defense of property works LULW
[8:02:04] Gerald_O: @Ragestrike Yeah also if you drive around a city and then intervene in a police scene
[8:02:06] Arctic_JDM: mhm
[8:02:07] frostflakeheron: Hmmge
[8:02:07] Leafyerick: YEP
[8:02:12] KhrisOsaurus: YEP
[8:02:13] Bill_Collector: He's a danger period
[8:02:14] Berserake: Cao was tazed when he was struck
[8:02:16] Joongi_: NotLikeThis
[8:02:17] shanejo127: Nahhhh
[8:02:17] thxmuhs: Stack all the charges baby fk em
[8:02:18] jy33130: LUL LUL LUL
[8:02:20] TwitchPrimes_1: johnson?
[8:02:20] hesher2397: no it does not bro
[8:02:24] johnnytruel0ve: @xblasphemye im not complaining about what happened i was calling @csteele2020 a double digit iq mongoloid
[8:02:24] lolheads580r: YEP cock
[8:02:25] 33jona: chat just got here wts happened today
[8:02:26] Juiicer: @Protomateria Thats why I posed a question, not a statement lol
[8:02:26] jorundrr: police who brought him to the scene and allowed him to attack
[8:02:27] callmefive: yes
[8:02:27] xblasphemye: @csteele2020 on top of the fact that it also lead to awesome RP and a new story line WHICH IS THE POINT OF RP...HOLY CRAP
[8:02:28] droksid00: OK I asked a real attorney. The arrest isn't invalid in real life. The guy can still be charged. It would only be invalid if the PD breached civil rights to apprehend them
[8:02:28] johnny_killmore: no its whoever initiates the assault
[8:02:28] Bill_Collector: Yeah should have blasted both
[8:02:30] Gundaree: @Wynter282 nah honesty is the best and saying you understand where he made mistakes.....trying to spin it shows no accountability
[8:02:31] Archangel3003: @johnnytruel0ve K got what he deserved. It's as simple as that with how it played out.
[8:02:35] callmefive: no
[8:02:40] Bill_Collector: Exactly
[8:02:41] lukefish710: cau was the aggressor tho right?
[8:02:41] Wallsh_: just digging a hole.  I think you should just wait and see what happens.
[8:02:41] callmefive: omg
[8:02:43] enser27: cau and chris both wrong in that situation
[8:02:44] inducedcatharsis: Classic Lenny
[8:02:44] mrs_strawberryy: laundromat Classic
[8:02:46] Vikairius: True, Chris could have stopped once Cau was tazed
[8:02:47] Andizzzle: Andizzzle subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 31 months, currently on a 8 month streak! hi chat :)
[8:02:48] Cthyllah: yeah cao wouldnt have even been there (most likely) if he didnt come with aziz
[8:02:48] Techno_Plumber: https://clips.twitch.tv/SeductiveLachrymosePidgeonKAPOW-OSJYvJezufdpvAN2 Rooker Said he'll shoot
[8:02:49] frostflakeheron: Susge
[8:02:49] KhrisOsaurus: Classic
[8:02:49] PietertjeNL: LENNY DOWN!
[8:02:51] madhatterui: he did say stay in the car
[8:02:52] Kaisenjin: @Bill_Collector Exactly
[8:02:53] Protomateria: @Juiicer fair, sorry if i came off as being condescending
[8:02:57] raiforen: frenn
[8:02:58] kylef_: NOOO LENNY
[8:02:59] TielerWindsong: Esfand is right you can't retaliate on someone that is running away
[8:02:59] KhrisOsaurus: YEP
[8:03:00] offbrand: K this K that its Joel hours
[8:03:05] KhrisOsaurus: NOOO MY LENNY NOOO

[8:03:10] SpiceWeaseI: Joel
[8:03:10] ItsMeArgon: That's true
[8:03:12] shanejo127: Classic good faith
[8:03:12] quaylewastaken: TRYING TO JUSTIFY ARRESTING AN INACENT PERSON
[8:03:14] Ragestrike: Thats what i said eariler what she is saying
[8:03:15] ImToreos: He could have got out the car and punched Chris the same way he tried to hit him with a wrench rhiShrug
[8:03:16] tekzd: Joel
[8:03:17] Bill_Collector: Kit is 100% right. Aziz fucked up sure, but the cops did nothing wrong in blasting his ass
[8:03:18] TheGodmother: @offbrand kekw
[8:03:24] CrutonArt: W archer just saved aziz's job
[8:03:25] chmod_R_777: I agree, he should go to jail... hes a criminal too
[8:03:25] Neekapkilla: I wish Cao would have put in his statement that he was beaten while being electrocuted lol
[8:03:27] joet1118: SHOT!
[8:03:27] Joongi_: YEP
[8:03:28] Bill_Collector: Both can be true
[8:03:30] Cthyllah: exaccctly

[8:03:47] Bill_Collector: A real porque no los dos type bear
[8:03:50] Bill_Collector: Beat
[8:03:52] Vikairius: Kit earning her senior officer
[8:03:56] condor2104: Yup
[8:03:57] xblasphemye: @johnnytruel0ve im just stating it was good for RP and people dont seem to understand that. the content gods are providing and somehow the clowns are complianing. good for rp is good for rp
[8:04:00] Talker100: id end the convo after this
[8:04:00] Gundaree: @CrutonArt she is one of the good ones, lets hope it works but beric is I think understanding
[8:04:01] johnnycash1918: How Archer is a base officer :D
[8:04:02] Kaisenjin: BASED Kit
[8:04:03] stovesy121: id like to see her asst chief tbh
[8:04:05] NextEraGamer: Yep. Same could have happened with no weapon. This is a great story
[8:04:13] Archangel3003: Archer is right completely here yeah
[8:04:14] Yidz: BatChest
[8:04:16] TheLastRace: He said the Thing
[8:04:17] enser27: cau actually tried to hit chris while chris had his hands up lol thats even worse yikes
[8:04:18] Protomateria: grand theft auto BatChest
[8:04:20] killerpvm: self defense doesn’t apply if you chase someone down then attack them after they were tazed
[8:04:27] Wynter282: it sucks so hard that the people who stole his car are being made out to be the VICTIMS, cornwood has said several times he would shoot somebody who was tryi ng to steal a turbo but now cao is getting in trouble for defending his
[8:04:29] johnny_killmore: @Protomateria based
[8:04:30] CrutonArt: @Gundaree beric isnt a robot like the captains and can actually think on his own lmfao
[8:04:33] ironpuft: rolll credits!
[8:04:38] Ryuzeren: better get ready KEKW
[8:04:39] CrystalDimension: https://clips.twitch.tv/PuzzledSavorySproutAMPEnergy-Cgtv6Yk0qt7m9AJT OMEGALAUGHING
[8:04:39] Bill_Collector: Yeah Aziz is feeling guilty about this. He needs to understand that the other officers actions were justified and he also fucked up, it is what it is and move on
[8:04:39] stovesy121: either her or ruth
[8:04:41] MrFuniBones: Waiting
[8:04:43] shanejo127: He has a right to defend himself based on the conversation
[8:04:43] Hustler__John: amen
[8:04:44] csteele2020: @xblasphemye we’re talking to a brick wall here. dude wants his crim to get W after W. doesn’t understand rp. dagum shitshow
[8:04:46] bigmatcomb0: please do
[8:04:46] naturestuch: wait did they charge someone with grand theft auto?

[8:04:52] Dyslecsic: @Wynter282 cornwood would be arrested for that too
[8:04:53] Map_Of_Your_Head: PepeHands aziz grab the hand helping you
[8:04:54] ArdentCause: @enser27 yeah and then chris hit cau after cau was on the ground tased it goes both ways its a shit situation  0

[8:05:16] StrawHatDan13: damn kinda messed up cau gonna lose his g6 job over this
[8:05:17] Rivath: Aziz is actually wrong on this
[8:05:19] MisterTroubleMaker: FeelsStrongMan Duncaning
[8:05:19] TeeRiot: but he did it
[8:05:22] CrystalDimension: https://clips.twitch.tv/AwkwardHappyNeanderthalNotATK-QuSuyXSdjsZY9QRq
[8:05:23] b2a80: he did chase him though, so iono
[8:05:26] ArdentCause: @enser27 agreed
[8:05:30] Kaisenjin: @CrystalDimension OMEGALAUGHING Great clip
[8:05:32] vicrocity2009: sick give the civ a felony and turn him into a crim with a car that does 200 mph thats going to be a issue to deal with in the future
[8:05:32] Bill_Collector: Nobody forced cau to do any of this
[8:05:39] Rhinoplast: his initial carjacking started it  all, yes he can be charged lmao
[8:05:39] catloyalist: Aziz is right yall just going in circles stop
[8:05:42] SarahFlare: why would it be assault with a deadly when no contact was made by cau mau, right? I thought it was said he didn't make contact with anyone.
[8:05:42] shanejo127: Charging with stealing the car is fine
[8:05:43] Techno_Plumber: https://clips.twitch.tv/CovertPlumpSkunkRitzMitz-pVkMNpcE7kD8oJVi
[8:05:45] Bill_Collector: He did this shit out of his own volition
[8:05:45] Gundaree: @CrutonArt my biggest problem with the captains is they never change their view o things when confronted with new information....no adaptability is frustrating, mind made up and cant do a thing about it
[8:05:47] Rastafiki: pit successful LUL
[8:05:50] kilimanjaroke: Kit is kinda right
[8:05:51] cjohno20: well why would PD open fire if you weren't charging him
[8:05:51] Trolltex87: Sometimes problems take  care of themselves
[8:05:53] Cthyllah: chris should still be charged, because hes gonna sue either way
[8:05:58] Shakeboxing: lol @EsfandTV - rolling cops https://clips.twitch.tv/BeautifulPolishedCougarTF2John-cX5jE4y-mTDKCLAy
[8:06:05] k1nneDECIR: o7
[8:06:06] scarydisk: Kit is right, this is two cases. Criminal for stealing. Civil or getting shot by cops.
[8:06:07] jimslappinslim: what happens when they get sued?
[8:06:11] starshadowx2: It's like what if instead of Cau it was the Mayor
[8:06:11] Bill_Collector: Kit is 100% right
[8:06:14] CrutonArt: It stops at that dude didnt obey stayng in the car
[8:06:16] csteele2020: archer frenn
[8:06:20] xnuttybutterx: Shouldn't have criminals as informants then
[8:06:23] starshadowx2: you don't know that someone with you is going to go crazy
[8:06:24] rocker22_: Everyone involved  should be charged and if they sue they sue
[8:06:24] Scoo73r: Call it mutual combat
[8:06:25] Khaosshinobi: time to call xavier BASED
[8:06:27] Vikairius: @cjohno20 they shot because he was a swinging a weapon on people. What kinda argument are you making lol
[8:06:27] enser27: based
[8:06:30] Protomateria: kit BASED
[8:06:31] chmod_R_777: you had SOPs tho... judge might want to know why you didnt do your job hmjj
[8:06:31] jagy3k: America
[8:06:35] Bill_Collector: Aziz is falling in his own sword for no reason here
[8:06:36] ZuldeadTV: beric is definitely in a GIGACHAD state rn
[8:06:36] shanejo127: Charging him is fine shooting someone who Is defending is not
[8:06:38] droksid00: Cau is responsible for his own actions. Cau could have also just FOLLOWED the PD vehicle or drove their on his own. Aziz didn't break any laws.
[8:06:42] Alexpcorbin: Alexpcorbin subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 4 month streak! 
[8:06:44] johnny_killmore: @Scoo73r no mutual with weapons
[8:06:44] alaterra: I like her
[8:06:46] k1nneDECIR: SeemsGood
[8:06:47] jorundrr: He brought him to the scene, how is that not him at fault? pretty sure he could lock him in
[8:06:49] ZuldeadTV: dude's just chilling with his cigar and gun
[8:06:49] starshadowx2: and it was a fast moving situation so it's understandable not to frisk that fast
[8:06:50] Wallsh_: true
[8:06:50] a2th3vi: Chat is there a clip or something I can watch about what they're talking about?
[8:06:53] Wynter282: @scarydisk he hit cao when cao was down tazed lol thats defo a shootable offense no matter who started it
[8:06:58] Mangodecuba: mimmimimmmiim
[8:06:59] KhrisOsaurus: LULW ?
[8:07:02] counterflow22: Mortal kombat! <intro plays>
[8:07:08] Bill_Collector: Aziz broke internal procedure not the law and it's a learning experience.
[8:07:10] Cthyllah: he also cant drive, his license is suspended
[8:07:11] genesissukehiro: https://clips.twitch.tv/BlazingJollyDelicataBatChest-vny8dsdkFaz1MWud
[8:07:11] StillTrynaGetAHandbeezy: it would be like a 30minute clip @a2th3vi
[8:07:14] ZuldeadTV: @a2th3vi https://clips.twitch.tv/FragileYawningBarracudaTF2John-0j11lEJpuZemlxXL
[8:07:15] Scoo73r: Does Cau being tazed and no longer a threat while being beaten matter?
[8:07:21] Gundaree: @chmod_R_777 true and asking if they have weapons on them is not enough, as Dr House always said People always lie!
[8:07:22] cjohno20: @Vikairius The cops in this convo are saying it was self-defense. Judge is gonna ask why officers shot if it was self-defense
[8:07:30] VictoriaKFC: @scoo73r I wondered that too
[8:07:33] BaldPanda360: none of this would have happened if they hadnt stole the car to begin with. So, no matter what he needs to charge the GTA Suscpect @EsfandTV
[8:07:36] droksid00: @EsfandTV No, that's not what I meant. I meant that hypothetically, Cau could have hopped in another car and followed. So you can't blame Aziz for anything that Cau did.
[8:07:38] ltygel: The cops should have just put out a bolo
[8:07:40] chmod_R_777: @Gundaree cops dont ask, they check

[8:08:50] Archangel3003: @droksid00 Archer just already said that though. Aziz warned him and so anything Cau did once he got out of the car is not on Aziz as Cau ignored a lawful order.

[8:09:36] Capn_Stew: He wasn't considered a suspect at that time
[8:09:37] Gundaree: @Archangel3003 yeah Aziz did most right. but in cases liek this they are not looking at the 99 things you did right but the one thing you did wrong
[8:09:37] ItsMeLuMo: Here comes the dragon

[8:10:06] CrutonArt: disobeying a lawful order
[8:10:07] Gundaree: @JustZDF at this point I woudl not be agaisnt banning the character K lol
[8:10:12] ItsYojimbo: Why is cornwood trying to jump on a grenade for cau? Cau disobeyed a order and committed a crime. thats all there is to it.
[8:10:13] Wallsh_: lmao Cau fucked around and found out
[8:10:16] Archangel3003: @Rivath Um ok... How does that apply to anything I just said though????
[8:10:18] TwitchPrimes_1: dont do the crime if you cant do the time right?
[8:10:23] cjohno20: It's tough though you can't allow vigilantism
[8:10:26] SarahFlare: I really don't understand how it would be assault when no contact was made. Is it because it was an attempt?
[8:10:28] resonantblip: in front of police
[8:10:29] CrystalDimension: @Firehead94 when was that here (how many hours ago ?) LUL or was it yesterday

[8:15:23] johnnycash1918: Bro got robbed and lost job becouse of this xD
[8:15:23] enser27: @Wynter282 cau also tried to hit chris with a weapon while chris hands are up. both bad
[8:15:27] thewarth0g: why ruin his RP of G6 cos he swung a weapon when his car was stolen and he was taking to the scene he shoudnt be at

[8:15:42] nantredan: I think felony obstruction would stick but assault with a deadly might now
[8:15:47] ryanvee93: Why not just drop all charges so there wouldn't be a law suit
[8:15:47] sdcole1016: Cau hitting the PD with Stand Your Ground argument is the funniest timeline
[8:15:48] magedufker: Putting a victim on an active crime scene what you expect basic inntrapment

[8:16:07] Ah_desu: (just my opinion)should charge him anyway, or it make a precedent of people doing justice themselves and getting away with it, he attacked someone who was unarmed at the time while cops were there @EsfandTV
[8:16:08] thewarth0g: he shoudnt have been taken to the scene
[8:16:08] Paudelly: Aziz is wrong here. Officers dont need to ask permission to use force. If they feel force needs to be used then they use force
[8:16:09] sluggerrrrrrr: Cau can still ask for a pardon or expungement since it's his first felony
[8:16:09] EnoStone: @Rivath isnt he at 5 daps? next one 24hrs suspension

[8:16:38] Bill_Collector: The cops didn't hold a gun to his head and say swing
[8:16:44] Maz0hyst: @magedufker Change the I to an E and take off the second N OKEY
[8:16:52] Leafyerick: Beric is the biggest W the PD has had so far
[8:17:03] redmistintheair: tell both to stop being dumb and they go about there ways. no suing anyone??/
[8:17:04] layla109: He disobeyed an order to stay in the car right?
[8:17:06] energizergeyser: @EsfandTV would is not be disobeying a police officer instead of felony obstruction?
[8:17:07] Kalmquat: I love how Beric is approaching this situation. Great leadership imo
[8:17:10] Wynter282: oh boy that clip shows aziz leaving out stuff and lying lol....thats not good
[8:17:14] shanejo127: It for sure didn't go down how Aziz said but I would like to see the other officers statements
[8:17:17] condor2104: yea but Aziz told him to stay in the car
[8:17:19] spicyville: @leafyerick RP isn’t about W’s UltraMad
[8:17:22] Redtwintails: @Leafyerick agreed
[8:17:25] Vikairius: Chris hitting a downed individual definitely justify the assault. We will see if anyone has it in their statements
[8:17:25] Rivath: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2084947368 hour 4:51
[8:17:27] mikelowery29: @EsfandTV is there a charge for disobeying a lawful order?  That should be the charge, given what Beric said
[8:17:27] Bill_Collector: This is easy to articulate a defense in civil court for this tbh
[8:17:27] taraannee: it’s been three hours NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[8:17:30] Gundaree: @shanejo127 what is he lieing about?
[8:17:42] magedufker: @maz0hyst you can't message gets eaten by cornwood
[8:17:44] resonantblip: ABOBA
[8:17:45] Firehead94: has it even been confirmed they are getting sued or is this all hypotheticals at this point?
[8:17:47] RietArtwork: Cornwood is trying to protect everyone by not sueing Cal, if he gets sued, he will not help Aziz if this case goes to trial
[8:17:48] spansonite1: esfandPrio esfandHYPER
[8:17:48] BaitIHaveUlt: @Maz0hyst  ICANT
[8:17:58] yaboygrumbles: What’s good y’all happy weekend
[8:18:04] Wynter282: @Gundaree the guy clearly beat him knowing he was tased, and tghen aziz shot him when he told chief he didnt shoot
[8:18:05] reagadin: the problem is that you are thinking of the consequences for an action a civ took. they should think of that before taking that action.
[8:18:13] k1nneDECIR: Hey @yaboygrumbles . VoHiYo
[8:18:15] Archangel3003: @Joongi_ Yeah that's a whole shitshow for sure. Guy just beating Cau while he's tased on the floor and getting shot at while doing so LUL
[8:18:16] Rivath: It's not defending himself Aziz
[8:18:16] Kolipto: Trying to think how to apply K.I.S.S. in this scenario.
[8:18:19] Map_Of_Your_Head: i just FailFish
[8:18:19] lukefish710: should definitely get grand theft for stealing the car
[8:18:22] callmefive: Cal was tazed
[8:18:24] NadelosRiverVT: @Gundaree cau swung once put his weapon away said im de escalating and ran then got bonked while tazed on the ground
[8:18:26] jeffrey778: i think some situations happen an unfold so fast its hard to go by the book 100%
[8:18:38] taraannee: i don’t think u can charge him at all unfortunately
[8:18:40] catloyalist: yall gonna start annoying him
[8:18:40] Gundaree: @Wynter282 ow ok
[8:18:40] Vikairius: As soon as cao was tazed and down Chris should have stopped and didn't. So that's the spicy part
[8:18:43] Bill_Collector: Youre on the hook for everything up until he took actions on his own accord
[8:18:45] shanejo127: @gundaree Chris kept saying he is deescalating but he wasnt.  He was saying it while doing the opposite
[8:18:45] nocherlas: nocherlas subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 3 month streak! yay
[8:18:52] Bill_Collector: But it's still defensible
[8:18:54] Leafyerick: I think if Cau was no longer a threat and Chris chased him down he loses the self defense argument
[8:18:56] Gr1zzz: @jeffrey778 yup
[8:19:04] nickstanderfer: wasnt chris already charged, he was in jail
[8:19:07] Capn_Stew: So you need to write a warrant for his arrest.
[8:19:11] PewbesSalad: anyone else notice this indian traffic lmaooo
[8:19:12] callmefive: hello Cal was tazed when Chris came at him with the wrench he was no longer a threat
[8:19:12] Bill_Collector: @nickstanderfer yes
[8:19:12] Vikairius: The statements are huge for this
[8:19:13] TimmayHS: LUL
[8:19:14] Neekapkilla: he was not defending himself, that part is getting annoying lol. you gotta watch the clip OOC at some point in the future haha
[8:19:17] enser27: @nickstanderfer was for somethin else
[8:19:20] NadelosRiverVT: @nickstanderfer he punched aziz in hospital

[8:19:54] brunop83: LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
[8:19:55] the_schlan: The hinge point is if Chris king meets all points of stand your ground. And didnt Cau run away after inserting himself while police were presents so therefore Chris was not in the right to defend himself anymore?
[8:20:06] shanejo127: @gundaree 100 percent
[8:20:09] Alcarus1: esfandAyo
[8:20:11] romoleus: Call IAD LUL
[8:20:13] manlydann: cornwood would have 100% shot if he was there
[8:20:13] taraannee: now officers do this thing like “slacks i deserve a dap” to get ahead of it so he thinks more highly of them LUL
[8:20:25] chmod_R_777: Evilge I can't wait for Cau to be in ruin
[8:20:26] wigren98: pre o7
[8:20:29] x_Gordo: @codex88 it would be under self defense tho
[8:20:31] Neekapkilla: @the_schlan Yes, and cao was literally shaking on the ground tazed when King beat him down lol
[8:20:33] Saggitari0: o7
[8:20:40] Wynter282: aziz is simultaneously taking blame and shifting blame how is this happening
[8:20:46] Hdotkayy: o7

[8:23:04] taraannee: i think it’d be a bigger mess to bring any of this to court or press charges
[8:23:07] PoisonDart11: yeah the guy saw him get tazed and said fuck it and slammed cau down
[8:23:08] gsinot: @EsfandTV didnt cau tell you in the report he was yelling he is deescalating and he was tazed
[8:23:09] KaycasTV: @spicyville dude is just a straight up hate watcher
[8:23:09] xblasphemye: yeah we have been saying that lol
[8:23:10] daedayz: cau is wrong for getting out. otherwise the perspectives are just their own.
[8:23:12] madhatterui: im so confused
[8:23:13] Byzzaro: show us
[8:23:14] Archangel3003: So if Cau swung at him before trying to run away, then how is it still not self defense?
[8:23:14] davidayotte: it doesn’t matter weather u no is ooc… its rp
[8:23:17] Cthyllah: do you mean chris
[8:23:17] the_schlan: And you took Caus statement therefore its IC to have Aziz review Caus statement
[8:23:20] Rivath: I mean Aziz tazed Cau when he was retreating which didn't seem right

[8:23:27] wavy__________________: Cau is right and wrong
[8:23:27] brushun: Huh? Cau was wrong but he was right?
[8:23:30] RebornOffline: @manlydann You can't claim stand your ground when the other part is running away with their back to you
[8:23:31] Gundaree: Aziz wants his bingo card complete, 10 daps check, suspended check, fired tbd
[8:23:32] thewarth0g: tell him to think really carefully
[8:23:33] willyray: i have no idea what is going on

[8:23:36] Solventless710: so cal in the wrong but he is right?
[8:23:37] davidayotte: i agree with aziz
[8:23:37] chivvyy: idk why ppl are linking these directly meta clips tbh
[8:23:38] shanejo127: That doesn't matter?  Cornwood taking his side with what he knows isnt right
[8:23:39] GanunaTwo: cau tried to kill bluehair where is he right ? kill for stealing his car ?
[8:23:43] Leafyerick: Charge him with the felonies and let him plea deal for the misdemeanors is the best way to handle this
[8:23:45] spicyville: @kaycastv Classic
[8:23:45] enser27: both are wrong. cau still tried to hit a man with his hands up with a weapon
[8:23:47] MDM4ever1986HD: Aziz is wrong in this one
[8:23:54] RebornOffline: @chivvyy He wanted to see it?
[8:23:55] ItsYojimbo: tell him he needs to really recollect on his thoughts privately
[8:23:56] callmefive: Cau was tazed when Chris was beating him
[8:24:01] BaarelyLegal: PepeLaugh
[8:24:04] xDinkleBot: literally everyone in this scenario is at fault in some way LULW
[8:24:06] manlydann: @RebornOffline so if someone tries to hit someone, and then run away, you cant stand your ground? what makes you think they wont go back for seconds
[8:24:06] enser27: @ItsYojimbo thats kinda meta
[8:24:07] callmefive: that’s why officers shot
[8:24:07] davidayotte: that’s why u dont meta chat lol
[8:24:13] Archangel3003: Yeah the other guy shouldn't have been left to beat him down while he was tased on the floor. But he did still swing at the guy first right?

[8:29:30] 903gaming: cops need body cams
[8:29:32] TOXICI3unni: wait im miss it what happend
[8:29:37] superdave0603: sbs for sure
[8:29:41] nocherlas: @Bannanabread04 thank you
[8:29:43] skeletonmike: aziz is swanging himself into unnecessary daps
[8:29:47] shanejo127: It's not.  Cornwood is boys with and trusts Aziz.  I don't understand being intellectually honest.
[8:29:47] No_Choices: so did aziz
[8:29:48] x_Gordo: Aziz just said that
[8:29:48] Vikairius: That McNulty clip is hilarious
[8:29:50] Joongi_: He's trying so hard OMEGALUL
[8:29:51] missmuffet: Aziz doing same thing Brian Knight did: upset about one situation and getting another situation wrong
[8:29:52] ZuldeadTV: i'm pretty sure body cam is not happening, someone said it was too OP and would kill court RP
[8:29:53] iii_governor_iii: he said that
[8:29:54] imacableguy: cops statement has more weight so o7 cau
[8:30:05] LucidShooter: @ZuldeadTV yeah, nopixel doesn't use body cam footage
[8:30:06] shanejo127: Dishonest*
[8:30:12] NurseBrina: HE JUST SAID CAU RAN
[8:30:16] ZuldeadTV: @LucidShooter ty wasn't entirely sure
[8:30:17] Faylez: @imacableguy Clueless
[8:30:19] jwou11: aziz has said chris hit muscle guy all along
[8:30:20] kennypowersyall: GETALIFE GIVE AZIZ A KISS
[8:30:22] xblasphemye: it sucks sometimes if people are dishonest just for RP.. i dunno I kinda think that the situations are enough RP why do we have to rp even harder and lie about stuff i dont get that but whatever
[8:30:23] MDM4ever1986HD: @GiraffeCubed OMEGALUL
[8:30:30] Suggs00: Aziz is misremembering but Cornwood didn’t see so it’s tough
[8:30:31] WarrenPuffit: Cau started the conflict
[8:30:35] x_Gordo: Cau only witness is the cop that shot him
[8:30:36] wavy__________________: GETALIFE
[8:30:36] WarrenPuffit: but got screwed as well
[8:30:41] soosmaz74: he forgot yea
[8:30:42] BaldPanda360: He said Cau  Ran, so the other guy was no longer defending himself @EsfandTV
[8:30:43] SaltiBanana: ya true
[8:30:45] LucidShooter: @ZuldeadTV they used to, but doing so basically just becomes watching cop vods and isn't that fun for RP. obviously it would help in situations like this, but it is what it is
[8:30:47] NextEraGamer: This is tough for real
[8:30:51] Swisskeey: i think johnson got fired for not remebering?
[8:30:54] outlawpickle: do citizens have the right to use force to recover their property? could be a genuine argument from cau, despite police commands
[8:30:55] Larnus: yea probably, it is what it is LUL
[8:30:57] RebornOffline: You don't remember it correctly but you think you do
[8:30:58] Hardpu: Troll Aziz telling him he needs correctional training with Bobby Charles
[8:30:59] harbhub: just got here chat, whats the tldr lol
[8:30:59] bzerk26: he also did say he's descalating
[8:31:00] taraannee: @swisskeey no
[8:31:01] Shoematey: +1 rp for having bad memory
[8:31:02] yaboygrumbles: Fog of war lol
[8:31:02] superdave0603: yeah he just mis remembered
[8:31:03] Gundaree: maybe other cop statements will correct it?
[8:31:05] soosmaz74: @Swisskeey this is different
[8:31:05] johnny_killmore: @outlawpickle no
[8:31:06] SarahFlare: @WarrenPuffit I'm not sure that's true, wouldn't the act of stealing Cau's car be the start of the conflict?
[8:31:07] shanejo127: Aziz is totally wrong the shooting is fair.  Aziz is wrong.  Cornwood would back Aziz.
[8:31:07] weinerschnitzel__: yeah when you repeat a story so may times you forget some of it
[8:31:08] Freddiepines: @Swisskeey This is an extremely similar situation, yes
[8:31:08] craigeybo: it happens so fast that they forget
[8:31:14] NurseBrina: if cau is running then its def assault with a deadly
[8:31:15] Redtwintails: cars drifting down the street
[8:31:16] ArdentCause: def not dishonest - mis-remembering happens to everyone - especially in a situation like that when 1000 things are happening
[8:31:17] thysiastery: this sucks
[8:31:17] callmefive: Aziz going to be pulling his foot out of his mouth after this stream when he reviews the video IRL
[8:31:17] OldwisePaly: outlawpickle no they do not.
[8:31:18] HoneyBK: yeah I think in his memory he is recalling what happened but just mixed the 2 ppl up :/
[8:31:19] Protomateria: @outlawpickle probably not, that sounds like vigilante justice
[8:31:20] jeffrey778: some times people can think they remember something that is false as well. even in good faith
[8:31:20] revenueprofit: @xblasphemye i think it's more realistic if aziz goes off memory instead
[8:31:20] Cr4ss: maybe mention to go over teh incident step by step again to trigger the memory?
[8:31:24] ZuldeadTV: @LucidShooter yeah I can see it becoming extremely op if you can just watch all of cops vods
[8:31:26] Geralt_De_Rivia: You all also have access to all the vods. SGTapollo is just using what he knows IN CHARACTER like he supposed to
[8:31:27] MarvMelody: HOLD
[8:31:29] deafguy87: im still confused on what even happend OMEGALAUGHING
[8:31:29] wafiy637: i mean aziz deserves DAPS for that ..
[8:31:31] Faylez: Joel
[8:31:33] harbhub: what happened chat
[8:31:34] Kitkatzy: eye witness testimony is super unreliable irl, and games are no different.
[8:31:37] Redtwintails: DURIIFTOO
[8:31:40] killerpvm: This is why eye witnesses testimony is notoriously bad
[8:31:40] TimmayHS: "Man, I just wish we had body cams to go back and review"
[8:31:40] beefaronipie: im not seeing enough emotes chat!!!!
[8:31:40] resonantblip: he fabricated memory of worst case scenario lol
[8:31:41] xblasphemye: @revenueprofit i guess thats true since they really dont have "body cams"
[8:31:42] iwannanuhh: Witness statements are one of the most fallible pieces of evidence. Its proven that the human memory on events like this is wrong WAY too often
[8:31:44] NextEraGamer: Insane
[8:31:45] BaldPanda360: He said Cau ran, so the other guy was no longer defending himself @EsfandTV
[8:31:45] imacableguy: @baldpanda360 it could work in court if said well. Once you run, you are no longer the attacker.
[8:31:46] k1nneDECIR: @Kitkatzy . SeemsGood
[8:31:47] Rastafiki: the Streamers playing cops have a lot to pay attention too. its not unreasonable to think they forget stuff easy, being so swamped. the viewers dont have the same situation so its easier for us to remember. plus we have clips and stuff.
[8:31:50] alaterra: where is that clip?
[8:31:51] outlawpickle: @Protomateria texas justice, friend
[8:31:51] Smalls3122: @EsfandTV ask Aziz if he REALLY remembers exactly what happened
[8:31:56] Techno_Plumber: @Kitkatzy totally
[8:32:02] NextEraGamer: This will be an interesting court case now for sure
[8:32:03] superdave0603: you can’t meta game with this though guys
[8:32:09] slatt5: idk it just seems like apollo is just trippin bc he doesn’t wanna get suspended & start all over again like u & den
[8:32:10] Freddiepines: @Swisskeey I was watching KJC's stream the day he boxed Mr. K, still feel like he was done dirty
[8:32:11] shanejo127: Now this is what matters
[8:32:25] TheNotoriousKEV: @EsfandTV the statement from lawson IMO makes Chris King liable for assault, the point where he swings ona tazed individual
[8:32:31] callmefive: Given independently
[8:32:32] xblasphemye: if a lot of statements are in agreement then ya know.. its a lot more believable
[8:32:41] shanejo127: The other officers statements matter
[8:33:03] CrystalDimension: https://clips.twitch.tv/ElegantFamousAmazonPogChamp-msy4my1xXCkXt4w2 actual shitshow LUL
[8:33:06] callmefive: yes
[8:33:09] GanunaTwo: @iwannanuhh yeah look at esfand not remembering cau admitted to cornwood for attempted murder in the car twice once at hospital once when retrieving his car.
[8:33:09] slatt5: @shanejo127 a lot of court rulings say otherwise
[8:33:11] NurseBrina: Cornwood saving Cau from a felony this is why we love Cornwood
[8:33:14] gsinot: ah OMEGALUL
[8:33:18] xblasphemye: <3

[8:33:24] Hayland111: @EsfandTV Would you fight this hard over it if you didnt see OOC information? genuine question
[8:33:24] ZuldeadTV: what he didn't swing at aziz

[8:33:38] superdave0603: Cornwood a good dude
[8:33:41] bakerboy404: @Hayland111 Yeah I'm curious about that too
[8:33:42] energizergeyser: heat of the moment goes hard
[8:33:48] TheNotoriousKEV: King doesnt have a leg to stand on, he went beyond defending himself
[8:33:53] callmefive: yes it does
[8:33:53] Larnus: @ZuldeadTV might've looked like it from where the officer stood
[8:33:54] soosmaz74: BASED
[8:33:54] Leafyerick: No it makes a huge difference
[8:33:56] NextEraGamer: It gives credibility
[8:33:57] NurseBrina: running and saying im deescalating

[8:34:04] papastonk741: Welp, K is free now. Cant wait to see what happens
[8:34:07] B4m_L33: it means it wasn't self defense
[8:34:15] callmefive: nope
[8:34:15] k1nneDECIR: @papastonk741 . Shush
[8:34:18] thysiastery: @papastonk741 o shit
[8:34:19] xblasphemye: <3
[8:34:25] chmod_R_777: the moment Cau runs, sure
[8:34:25] xblasphemye: yup not defense
[8:34:27] NurseBrina: ily estand! he's pursuing cau
[8:34:29] quadmommyy: I feel like Azis is trying too hard to be honest and it’s not helping
[8:34:29] imacableguy: “aggression” ends once you run away or put weapon away.
[8:34:33] pluck_it: the yellow individual is CAU @EsfandTV
[8:34:34] callmefive: How are you defending yourself from someone who is incapacitated?
[8:34:35] TheGodmother: @papastonk741 it's gonna be fun DANKIES
[8:34:36] RebornOffline: It's not defending yourself when you hit someone who's tazed and is on the ground
[8:34:37] DigitalCSJ: they're both liable for assualt
[8:34:44] soosmaz74: @papastonk741 ITs gonna be fire rp because cornwood will also never back down
[8:34:46] slatt5: @shanejo127 just look at the fanny case where she just spammed “I don’t remember”
[8:34:46] superdave0603: “cornwooding”
[8:34:46] energizergeyser: @DigitalCSJ exactlyyy
[8:34:46] layla109: Both were wrong
[8:34:48] NurseBrina: YES!
[8:34:51] wavy__________________: Classic Self-Insert
[8:34:58] Rastafiki: cau was running away. and he chased him. not self defense.
[8:35:00] quadmommyy: you can’t defend yourself against someone who is down, I don’t think that’s how that works
[8:35:05] ooNITRO: has "body cam footage" never been used in RP? seems like a perfect scenario that would clarify
[8:35:05] kennypowersyall: GETALIFE ELECTRIC CHAIR FOR ALL INVOLVED
[8:35:05] Silvertap: Yes
[8:35:05] x_Gordo: I dont think he's defending cau he just think chris should be charged too
[8:35:11] callmefive: exactly
[8:35:18] Alphawins: chris king is the fake name i use in the office to sign birthday cards
[8:35:19] enser27: cau stll getting assault /attempt assault either way, if anything it just adds the assault to chris
[8:35:20] The_Hate: /me plays Aziz's bodycam forsenCD
[8:35:21] RebornOffline: @ooNITRO Ruins RP moments, thats why they dropped it
[8:35:21] callmefive: That also justifies the officers
[8:35:24] JumpShotHD: someone got out of a cop car and tried to kill him 100% self defence
[8:35:24] greenburg22: can we get gamba on whether were done before the top of the hour
[8:35:25] shanejo127: Yeah but it's one statement over another
[8:35:26] Silvertap: He was already out of combat
[8:35:27] LucidShooter: @x_Gordo exactly. both need to be charged because cau was no longer a threat once he ran away
[8:35:31] Archangel3003: Yeah beating someone while they are tazed and on the ground is not self defense, that's assault.
[8:35:34] xDinkleBot: LULW
[8:35:37] kointoss88: lol
[8:35:38] Llamawaffle: LUWL
[8:35:38] SereneDreams: @ooNITRO I think Wrangler utilized it, he accepted some footage from Jean Paul with "a strange box in the corner"
[8:35:43] johnny_killmore: @Alphawins lmao
[8:35:55] kointoss88: "read through this properly"
[8:35:55] DigitalCSJ: The shooting is the problem

[8:36:04] k1nneDECIR: o7
[8:36:04] LucidShooter: @SereneDreams it was back in the day, not anymore though
[8:36:06] MilldawgJr: Aziz should have made his statement a long time ago probably
[8:36:10] romoleus: @Alphawins SeemsGood
[8:36:10] Wynter282: aziz :(
[8:36:12] PsychoJoker: @SereneDreams They dont wanna use it because it takes away from RP and them investigating etc it kinda defeats the purpose

[8:36:24] phaden_: Joel
[8:36:26] Sneakystinkyratman: Does dispatch have the Dash cam footage
[8:36:27] SereneDreams: @LucidShooter Yeah makes sense
[8:36:29] b2a80: maybe it would be a good idea to gsr test each officer involved at a scene where a gun is sdischarged
[8:36:31] callmefive: omg Aziz still doesn’t get it
[8:36:32] johnny_killmore: @MilldawgJr its weird to wait to take statements
[8:36:38] ZuldeadTV: i think both could be charged
[8:36:40] DigitalCSJ: did try still means its illegal
[8:36:45] energizergeyser: both should be charged
[8:36:45] shanejo127: Cau statement should be taken for a grain of salt its basically officer vs officer.  However Aziz is wrong.

[8:42:14] Archangel3003: Both Chris and Cau fucked up and both should be charged for what they did lol.
[8:42:16] ZuldeadTV: he could've shot him at the first swing then that's it
[8:42:21] ContentFiend: Brother Cau did just as much as Chris. Don't think thats hard to comprehend. He swung and assaulted no matter if he put it awaya
[8:42:23] energizergeyser: @TCGK_SUBZERO BIAS OMEGALAUGHING both cau and chris should be charged and if you dont get that then you're dumb

[8:43:14] Capn_Stew: Chris attacking Cau while he was already tazed should be assualt.

[8:43:55] energizergeyser: @ContentFiend he isnt, he is trying to say that chris should be charged too
[8:43:57] IzrevTheVirus: @shanejo127 ye for sure but kit saying it was all caus fault removes Chris's responsibility for Chris's actions. Least that's what I feel

[8:44:46] Prajna_Disciple: BAND
[8:44:49] Cthyllah: no matter what, cau still disobeyed aziz and assaulted chris. so it is still fair for them to charge him if thats what aziz chooses to do.
[8:44:53] giantpanda: @ItzAHoax I know :P I was there; I am Roger Dot.
[8:44:56] AndrewRNG: its bodycam footage Kappa
[8:44:57] MDM4ever1986HD: @resonantblip Aziz is in the wrong here Cornwood he's helping him
[8:45:01] JoeSizzle7: Not everyone has bodycam footage, chat. Can't give the privilege to some officers
[8:45:04] sdcole1016: @bigpharmaa I’m the white hat, my return is coming soon trust
[8:45:08] AdrianShoey: the clips don't help. he stepped out and swung a weapon.
[8:45:08] Rastafiki: i would just recuse yourself. it is between Aziz, Chris, and Cau
[8:45:10] Exotic_Soul: @carefreespreee there is lol, aziz told cornwood he should talk with knight because of statements not being properly adjusted in the report
[8:45:11] shanejo127: @izrevthevirus 100 percent but cornwood doesn't know in character.  In character it's a she said he said.
[8:45:11] thewarth0g: what does the mashing radio noise mean when you all ran
[8:45:16] Bannanabread04: @EsfandTV Is this cornwoods cousin? https://clips.twitch.tv/HandsomeSmellyAniseOSfrog-AStsMB0cmC12-lsR
[8:45:17] energizergeyser: @giantpanda you should use your 1911 on chat rn i'd hire you
[8:45:21] outlawpickle: i think corn absolutely try to stick up for cau initially, this has played out pretty well
[8:45:21] iwannanuhh: If a mistake gets made, then so be it. It will breed more RP which is the point, its not going to be the end of the world chat
[8:45:22] Vikairius: Aziz doesn't have the same perspective as the other officers from the side
[8:45:22] donneren: giantpanda whats your workout routine dude
[8:45:25] superdave0603: oh boy
[8:45:28] b2a80: @Static_ii there is no such thing as body cam.  that would make things way too easy. especially in court.
[8:45:31] shanejo127: Yes
[8:45:32] giantpanda: Roger Dot is my criminal xD

[8:45:40] TimmayHS: is he watching the clip?
[8:45:41] 903gaming: why dont cops have body cams to help cover their ass
[8:45:47] callmefive: What do you mean if he was tased you tased him?
[8:45:49] DrWetbone: people see different things too the game scuffs a lot
[8:45:49] superdave0603: I like Aziz
[8:45:49] spansonite1: <3
[8:45:51] Bannanabread04: DAMN Wrong clip agin!!
[8:45:51] slatt5: simply put: Chris CHOSE to chase after Cau put his wrench away & got shot shrujj
[8:45:52] outlawpickle: @903gaming eliminates RP
[8:45:52] Moregorilla: Cal told you he heard a cop tell him to stop and he reacted to that
[8:45:55] Byzzaro: no bodycam?
[8:45:57] HoneyBK: lmao i think he saw the clip :D
[8:45:59] dholdren12: it all comes back to if cal didn’t involve himself in the situation none of this would have happened
[8:45:59] MDM4ever1986HD: @903gaming against rp
[8:45:59] dabby2121: @EsfandTV couldnt cops use a "body cam" to at least say this is my POV
[8:46:00] PoisonDart11: jordan kekw
[8:46:00] GimeDepusiBoss: @iwannanuhh yeah hoping cau gets a felony so he can return to gangster lyf
[8:46:04] energizergeyser: OMEGALAUGHING but he didnt
[8:46:07] Skylo97: welllllllllllllllllllllllll
[8:46:09] Bannanabread04: THIS ONE LUL https://clips.twitch.tv/IncredulousRespectfulCamelDuDudu-Scaut2pQK7pLuxrR
[8:46:11] VictoriaKFC: eeeeeeeee
[8:46:12] carefreespreee: @Exotic_Soul cornwoods said multiple times theres no point. as it can be construed as forcing him to change a statement to hide evidence
[8:46:12] CHRISXUPSTAIRS: i mean he got tased because he wasnt listening OMEGALAUGHING
[8:46:13] superdave0603: it seems like he saw the clip lol 😂
[8:46:14] allstreamershateme: clip THIS
[8:46:15] slomojosh: NotLikeThis why weren’t there medical reports
[8:46:15] Vikairius: @903gaming it's less organic and too powerful
[8:46:15] lawlkat: Guys. cops don't have budgets for body cams. it's 4.0. get with it
[8:46:17] JustHope: cau did not have his wrench out at that point
[8:46:20] quadmommyy: @esfandtv I agree w what you’re saying about him having unfavorable thoughts about the PD after being charged, but he can pay to have the felonies off in the end which is a fair trade off for him having to face the consequences of his actions
[8:46:20] iwannanuhh: @GimeDepusiBoss LUL LUL
[8:46:27] slomojosh: medical reports should be a standard by this point
[8:46:28] PoisonDart11: body cams ruin rp, aint gonna happen
[8:46:29] imacableguy: both wrenches out, lol.
[8:46:30] VictoriaKFC: Prayge
[8:46:31] gruglax: omg that was a mess
[8:46:31] b2a80: If cops had bodycam, every situation would pretty much be an easy open and shut case.  It's too easy.
[8:46:45] Rivath: Aziz doesn't need to press the charge it's just pure panic
[8:46:48] ChaoticSanity: hows he gonna be able to tell who he shot when without using the VOD ?
[8:46:49] MDM4ever1986HD: Aziz is getting mixed up right?
[8:46:51] Usahi_Light: yeah bodycam is anti RP practicallyt
[8:46:51] 903gaming: the PD Statement is too powerful
[8:46:52] superdave0603: I like Aziz
[8:46:54] Exotic_Soul: @carefreespreee ur behind, this isnt about that, knight changed his statement to I believe captai n ruth afterwards but she never put that in the report
[8:46:57] b2a80: These types of interesting situations would never happen with bodycam.
[8:46:57] redmistintheair: we really need body cams back so bad
[8:46:57] Vikairius: If crims hate DNA body cams are 1000 times worse
[8:46:58] chmod_R_777: +1
[8:47:03] greenburg22: @outlawpickle sort of but i think it would eliminate a ton of he said she said lmao, not liek theyre doing meta bodycam, what the cop saw should be recorded u know. they can still argue from there
[8:47:07] shanejo127: I would officers statements are more believable than someone like cau
[8:47:10] DrWetbone: I don’t think they want them to use “body cams”. it leads to less rp
[8:47:13] thxmuhs: body cam is horriible rp
[8:47:16] espeiranza: @dabby2121 it's still early in the server so they were instruckted to not  use them for now
[8:47:16] Leafyerick: @Bannanabread04 Cornwood NPC is a tank
[8:47:17] allstreamershateme: @b2a80 OOOO they should call clips as body camera footage :O
[8:47:20] lawlkat: to be fair. i don't trust a word any cops say. ever.
[8:47:21] KhrisOsaurus: 🔫 KKonaW
[8:47:23] IzrevTheVirus: @shanejo127 oh. I thought there were 2 statement made that said kau was hit while down. They for sure should both be charged but it doesn't feel fair to me in saying it was all one person's fault
[8:47:25] wavy__________________: and people don't lie
[8:47:26] JoeSizzle7: Could the PD hire a cameraman like Cops though lol
[8:47:27] MDM4ever1986HD: it's like Knight all over again
[8:47:28] Usahi_Light: @greenburg22 there's no argument fro mthere, it kills almost all RP outside of chases
[8:47:32] t3hf4ult: @greenburg22 He said she said is RP.
[8:47:33] superdave0603: oof
[8:47:33] 903gaming: PD statement eliminates RP
[8:47:38] callmefive: wow
[8:47:39] chmod_R_777: PepeLaugh yall dont know about Dispatch's latest update uh?
[8:47:43] shanejo127: He didn't swing at Aziz for sure
[8:47:46] energizergeyser: @IzrevTheVirus you are right, there are 2 statements saying he was hit
[8:47:50] callmefive: lost cause Aziz
[8:47:52] Neekapkilla: the swing when Cau's body glitched probably looked like it was aiming at Aziz
[8:47:55] Cthyllah: aziz isnt lying, to be fair, in the middle of the panic, he is just purely misremembering
[8:47:55] k1nneDECIR: o7
[8:47:56] Moregorilla: Cal did tell you he heard a cap say stop so that why he ran away.. call told cornwood in the car that
[8:47:56] b2a80: @allstreamershateme makes things way too easy for everything on the cop side.  the forgetting stuff and arguing in court and the cells make more RP.
[8:47:57] Vikairius: Dash cams are different
[8:47:57] Beep_Cx: TriHuggo
[8:48:00] NurseBrina: Aziz T_T
[8:48:01] Leafyerick: frenn
[8:48:03] resonantblip: dashcams not body

[8:48:05] Haleos_x: Aziz frenn

[8:48:18] gruglax: what’s aziz going to be charged with ?
[8:48:20] ZuldeadTV: he didn't even come close to swinging at aziz
[8:48:25] shanejo127: The funny thing I think both statements are wrong
[8:48:26] funeralfortheliving: frenn aziz
[8:48:26] thatRIVERA: frenn
[8:48:29] Exotic_Soul: @carefreespreee ye and then aziz knows this now and told cornwood to talk with knight about it, which is why I asked if he talked with knight yet
[8:48:34] b2a80: If there was bodycam, every court case would be "check the bodycam" and done
[8:48:35] ZuldeadTV: the moment he stopped the swing animation at cau, he got knocked down
[8:48:39] superdave0603: exactly
[8:48:46] Talons235: Habibi Aziz
[8:48:51] MDM4ever1986HD: how many DAPs is it to lie in a report?

[11:46:50] AdrianShoey: @EsfandTV There should be a deferred adjudication option.
[11:46:52] DonnBeach: Like you say, just because you can charge something doesn't mean you should.

[11:46:57] Arctic_JDM: @Whippy BASED As usual
[11:46:57] Zedael: She didn't hit anything at all which is better than most drivers who just get evading
[11:46:58] Biolizard_: would reckless driving require hitting something?
[11:46:59] Tillo34: mhm baka driving
[11:46:59] NasrulAshr: Yeah
[11:47:00] slomojosh: @kratoids he’s not a lawyer

[11:47:03] claptil: True it's an interesting question
[11:47:03] Skuzzilbutt: You can get reckless driving if you're driving too far above the speed limit

[11:47:06] randomkiller563: @whippy sup
[11:47:09] Lord__Gen: Yeah it has to be careless AND a disregard for life.  I dont think that sticks
[11:47:09] KingKova: Shouldn't Cornwood relieve himself due to conflict?
[11:47:10] levesconte: driving 160 makes it reckless
[11:47:11] SurelyBaked: and you’re playing it exactly how cornwood would tbh. I’d say if anybody has earned his loyalty most in this entire city it’s been Siobhan. she’s been damn near his rock for months.
[11:47:11] bb_woo: We ❤️ you still cornwood lol👍😎
[11:47:11] Troubleshooter_NZ: unaware of the surroundings
[11:47:12] Guielme: it was reckless evading, crane is being "nice" @EsfandTV
[11:47:12] spongefrank: driving on the sideways should be reckless driving
[11:47:12] GuyInUniverse: Because of how fast she was going right?
[11:47:13] GenomeGorilla: going 25 over can be wreckless driving
[11:47:14] realitywolfdog: Everything
[11:47:14] DarkShadow4096: Stare
[11:47:14] Arctic_JDM: MY MIIIIILK NOOO
[11:47:16] sodrdie: Cornwood would never give felony to someone like this with clean history and many other cops, she got unlucky with lenny, declan and bones
[11:47:16] NasrulAshr: If its normal person, she prolly wont get reckless driving and a second chance
[11:47:16] Asura_Shini: Each state usually has a speed threshold where it goes from speeding to reckless(something)
[11:47:17] xblasphemye: but crane doesnt knoe because he cant self insert from another character
[11:47:17] Nobble1: SIXTEEN over limit is RECKELSS
[11:47:18] spongefrank: sidewalk
[11:47:18] Wintyer2: there was no gross endagerment  in that statment
[11:47:18] GreenMonk: @EsfandTV what human was in danger? locals? bill of privileges say otherwise? how does all that work
[11:47:19] superdave0603: I mean true
[11:47:19] Claxman2000: you will find out soon when she loses in court
[11:47:20] Vikairius: Reckless can be as simple as speeding at excessive speeds in bad weather or heavy traffic
[11:47:23] CrAZeD88: its confusing for sure
[11:47:23] raiforen: throw the book at her
[11:47:23] Wintyer2: or recless driving
[11:47:24] RebornOffline: You can drive reckless and it not being fast, that's prob why
[11:47:26] GYNECHIATRIST: reckless driving becomes a misdemeanour when PauseChamp
[11:47:27] santosair2: she didn’t crash
[11:47:27] sandstorm84: Cornwood please stop, you were not involved
[11:47:28] roguemax2512: ya i think reckless driving isnt right because it says gross disregard and she was avoiding vehicles not ramming them out of the way
[11:47:28] jeffrey778: i want to know as well, at what point does it turn into a disregard from human life.
[11:47:30] grimyoulater: 20 mph over the speed limit irl
[11:47:32] silasd22: Do you think the Mr.K possession + robbery of LEO was right?
[11:47:32] ContentFiend: Conflict causes better RP which I think cornwood sometimes struggles with 󠀀
[11:47:33] ChaoticSanity: he couldnt hear or see the emergency vehicle, this is texbook, watching him defend this is giving Hasan vibes
[11:47:34] elguapo42: Texas law defines reckless driving as a misdemeanor offense. Reckless driving could become a felony if it involves other conduct, such as racing. You could also face a felony charge when someone is injured or dies.
[11:47:34] depressamestreet: dude just stop
[11:47:35] TrippMinds: Was she evading if she doesn't know she was evading?
[11:47:35] trifidabs: 100+ mph is reckless driving
[11:47:35] heartsonlysoren: please stop
[11:47:35] thatclubdj: Why is attempted murder Less than holding a gun for 5 minutes
[11:47:37] Xethra: @EsfandTV they increased First Degree Speeding when they increased the speed limits, and didn't touch Reckless Driving
[11:47:37] sodrdie: if this was a G6 driver, the would never give a felony to her
[11:47:38] Craxxbones: LOL
[11:47:38] zoldren: modCheck
[11:47:38] Leafyerick: If this was me personally I could justify Reckless Driving 100% but I wouldn't have the heart to give it to her. I would've done 2x First degree and 2x Negilgent
[11:47:39] wavy__________________: LUL
[11:47:40] time4sleep: I think the Reckless part is because she was unable to have the ability to hear traffic, which is unsafe, ESPECIALLY at that speed
[11:47:41] MaRiNexICEx: ok sorry :X They said it had to do with speed and that she admitted not paying attention. I don't know either I just found it odd.
[11:47:42] Icestruggler: But its Declan and not Alan Crane
[11:47:42] ineedboutreefidy: its kinda just speeding
[11:47:42] kylef_: don't stop

[11:47:53] layla109: @time4sleep This!
[11:47:54] GlitchyGunZ: it isn’t surprising the pd would want to help people who are friends of the pd. it’s realistic too @esfandtv
[11:47:55] Daddy__Winston: shouldnt cornwood be on patrol?
[11:47:55] AnusReaktorMan: Chat stop backseat weirdos
[11:47:56] dholdren12: it’s the speed which makes it reckless
[11:47:59] V3NCHEl2: I think there is a statute in CA where the judge would decide if it was speeding or reckless driving, so they can commute the sentence down if charged with reckless, or raise the charge to reckless if charged with speeding
[11:47:59] DoseofDewey: you should speak to her
[11:48:00] xJOKURv: Crane said she was too far ahead to catch.. So how does she see him ? Makes sense
[11:48:01] imhughamongus: U keep saying crane, thats not crane tho

[11:48:20] genghisbong: @imhughamongus, it's crane's grandson, crane
[11:48:20] Nobble1: SIX FUCKING TEEN over is RECKLESS
[11:48:21] Milkage: Cornwood went from "you gotta put all the charges down and work your way from there" to "I don't know why you're puttin the felony on there"
[11:48:23] DoitwithDev: only time you see big streams try for a small one lol
[11:48:23] Vikairius: I think Cranes rationale is the disregard of surroundings because of being on the phone and loud music
[11:48:23] Icestruggler: Put the statement in the report
[11:48:31] FullyLoadedTX: bro where the FUCK is my gravy for my chicken

[11:48:39] TheEnemyAgent: going for ice cream is reckless evading
[11:48:40] its_huff_man: lolololol
[11:48:42] TheIrishCanuck: dude look at him

[11:48:44] anxietydies: She has to eat it

[11:48:47] its_huff_man: get out of your mdt

[11:48:55] such_tunz: my question is why is it ok for the cope to go 100 to get on the the freeway why are they not getting talked to for that..... just a question dont hate me for asking just trying to understand what really happen
[11:48:56] strudel____: 90+ mph is reckless operation
[11:48:56] romoleus: Reckless evading - Excessive speed say 30 over speed limit, on coming lanes, weaving, distruction of public property etc
[11:48:57] jeffrey778: i think they only thing they can argue in court would be, the disregard for human life.
[11:48:57] ZiroArchon: CHAT! When was the last time Esfand ate something?
[11:48:58] ItsMeZexx: maybe the charge doesn't be specific because it allows Police to be creative and rp circumstances of what could be tied to the charge??
[11:49:01] MinotaurFluff: CornWall
[11:49:01] wavy__________________: LUL
[11:49:04] Mr_J_369: @FullyLoadedTX I've got some gravy you can use.

[11:49:06] TOXICI3unni: go talk to her
[11:49:07] Craxxbones: You have to talk to deklan, that is your only chance
[11:49:07] atrigent: I can see it not being reckless evading if she didn't even know she was evading anyone, but reckless driving seems like it could fit at least as well as the possession thing
[11:49:10] quixan_: PEPW Ask Lenny more about his statement
[11:49:13] slumgator96: Talk to her at least
[11:49:13] xMkultra679: officer barbrady LUL

[11:49:25] beemo_plays: I don't think anyone care if it wasn't a felony. The fact it is a felony is wild considering what felonies mean in this city
[11:49:29] Doqx42: Putting Lenny on the stand to hear the explanation of not knowing what happened would be worth it all
