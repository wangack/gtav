[3:14:30] sullyshadari: my pals will fight
[3:14:35] MrSombraPR: GET THEM!
[3:14:36] professorliveee: yo how can you enjoy game without PVP
[3:14:43] sullyshadari: it do tho
[3:15:14] professorliveee: i mean the idea is nice . but its more like hard grind . no pvp no castles fights .. didnt saw like big raids
[3:15:28] MrSombraPR: @sullyshadari stamina sucks
[3:15:57] professorliveee: this game should be for Mobile and pc cross
[3:17:18] professorliveee: i am agree but when you made a game that is MMORPG open world you should cover all
[3:17:27] MrSombraPR: i want PVP but without destroying my hard to create base
[3:17:47] MrSombraPR: @professorliveee but this is not an MMO
[3:18:14] professorliveee: @MrSombraPR its kinda MMO bro . you got story mode . you got grind you got "bosses"
[3:18:37] professorliveee: what more you want- if the game keep like that ppl get tierd do same stuff
[3:18:55] MrSombraPR: @professorliveee you just described any co-op game
[3:19:10] MrSombraPR: the bosses entrances looks like borderlands, i love it
[3:19:27] professorliveee: no - cuz when you end CO-OP game its over.. in this game there is no "over" you keep grind keep catch Pokemons
[3:19:38] professorliveee: like he said more lvls . more regins.. MMo bro
[3:19:58] MrSombraPR: the game was made by 4 guys with $10k they already put out the roadmap
[3:20:27] MrSombraPR: MMO = Massive Multiplayer Online
[3:20:32] sullyshadari: I think im gonna do stamina and hp and a little weight
[3:20:32] MrSombraPR: this is not massive
[3:20:41] professorliveee: dont get me worng . the game look amazing . but you cant grind for ever and kill pokemons  so ez
[3:20:49] sullyshadari: but attack dont make sense since pals are the damage dealers and workspeed cause they do the owkr

[3:23:41] sullyshadari: @MrSombraPR like where? Ive never not been able to use my pals and honestly rarity upgrades on weapons increases damage far more than the attack stat
[3:23:48] MrSombraPR: i need to do that with my direwolf, fastest ground mount on the game
[3:24:02] MrSombraPR: @sullyshadari I'm thinking of the future

[3:25:25] MrSombraPR: @professorliveee PVP servers have leaderboards
[3:25:39] MrSombraPR: i do 1000 weight
[3:25:48] MrSombraPR: the rest i use pals to raise it if needed
[3:26:28] sullyshadari: I do think since you use rocket launcher at 50 attack may be worth it
[3:27:06] MrSombraPR: there's memory wiping medicine toiAsombrao
[3:27:18] sullyshadari: yea that's what we've both just used mrsobra
[3:27:25] sullyshadari: sombra*
[3:27:33] sullyshadari: I am just debating on what to put it in

[3:34:19] MrSombraPR: viewing cage is just for single player
[3:34:23] MrSombraPR: disabled on servers
[3:37:01] MrSombraPR: Palworld lets you do this by way of “Memory Wiping Medicine,” which you can craft with the right items.  At the time of this writing, however, it’s best to hold off on using this item as it will negatively impact your character’s catch rate. The developer, Pocketpair, has acknowledged the bug and a fix is expected in the future.
