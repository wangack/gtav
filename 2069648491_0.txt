[3:11:13] Sword_Scream: Reminds me of a story. Kid stole his younger brothers xbox 360 to trade in, all he got was like $15. Cuz he didn't want in store credit
[3:11:21] SpilledNuts: i sold a gacha account that had just really good rolls on it for $200 bucks EZ didn't spend a dime
[3:11:57] Deathchampt: theres a horse for 70 dollors on d4
[3:12:09] Sword_Scream: Denmark has laws for trade ins where you don't have the receipt. At best in store, at worst 100dkk ($15) in cash
[3:12:24] SpilledNuts: when i was in school there was so much scamming going on with yugioh and pokemon cards and stuff, people we're terrible to each other

[3:13:16] FiniteResources: what's really fucked up is charging $15/month for a 20 year old game

[3:13:32] Deathchampt: idiot
[3:13:45] FiniteResources: didn't do dick in classic
[3:13:54] FiniteResources: but I knew you'd disagree ;)
[3:13:59] Sword_Scream: I pay every other month on my FFXIV account. If I don't log in once every 45 days they tear down my house. If I was to sell my FFXIV account, owning that house alone would increase the account value by $400.
[3:13:59] Deathchampt: blizz went shit imo
[3:14:19] Sword_Scream: Cause housing is limited per server in FFXIV
[3:14:45] SpilledNuts: MMOs fucked my brain, its hard for me to play single player games even if their really good just doesn't give me that hit that an MMO or multiplayer games does
[3:14:52] FiniteResources: yeah but how is that not free to play 20 years later?
[3:15:04] FiniteResources: warzone is free to play and wow classic isn't?

[3:18:04] Gureet0: I ve been playing lol for free for 10 years lmao
[3:18:14] ArsonWelles: @harry path of exile is fully free. Stash tabs can be an issue, but you can play 100% for free
[3:18:15] Deathchampt: wow has both
[3:18:16] jambag00: id rather pay once
[3:18:17] FiniteResources: I understand it for new content, but classic was 20 years old

[3:19:00] SpilledNuts: same man
[3:19:19] acebey: d4 is not fun to play imo
[3:19:21] Leowulf: yeah i play retail and i think they are using SoD to somewhat playtest some new shit for upcomming hero talents.
[3:19:21] SpilledNuts: I'm a PoE head, but D3 is so much more fun to me then D4 has been
[3:19:37] Jareman: Yup d4 was a huge let down just like the WC3 Reforged it was a fucking disaster as a huge fan of the original
[3:19:37] UncarvedMatt: I played Neverwinter for a long time, that was pretty fun
[3:19:45] Deathchampt: wow2 copium
[3:19:51] rob6002: @acebey agreed
[3:19:55] Sword_Scream: Aion, after gameforge took over
[3:20:04] ArsonWelles: @spillednuts same, d3>d4
[3:20:10] Sword_Scream: Aion was decent when NCsoft had it, but when Gameforge took over? That was madness.
[3:20:12] UncarvedMatt: I never paid but yeah it was a grind to keep up with the pay to winners
[3:20:27] Jareman: Enjoying Nightingale so far just started it today the game looks absolutely amazing
[3:20:33] FiniteResources: I have the slightest hope for Pax Dei but I think i'm just generally over MMOs at this point
[3:20:38] Sword_Scream: Some guy spent $40k on a "Christmas box" for an item.

[3:46:49] zakataha1: how many possibilities there is actaully (moonshine formala) is it really 100k or smth
[3:47:43] Jareman: that would be cooked lol
[3:48:12] zakataha1: true that would make sens. its just more rare
[3:48:52] zakataha1: althought technically theres always the chance to get randomly the perfect possibilty
[3:49:33] zakataha1: i really wonder how much per perfect quatlity it would be $ / moonshine
[3:49:42] zakataha1: must be over 1k imo
[3:50:23] BurdenOrAGift: MF Doom was goated
[3:50:44] Jareman: Would you say the moonshine is your favorite "job" so far, harry?
[3:50:58] zakataha1: but like its soooo rare. i mean the money to even get to a good formula is alot. rn profit are soooo slim idk its not logical
[3:51:26] JayKoopa: It's been awhile since I tuned in. Now that you are doing the moonshine who has been growing the weed?
[3:51:30] zakataha1: its like weed kinda.. profit really slim
[3:51:34] JayKoopa: 9t has Harry been doing both?
[3:51:36] Jareman: Nice nice it seems meticulous perfecting the formula but thats the fun in it
[3:51:40] JayKoopa: Ahh, cool
[3:52:13] zakataha1: maybe moonshine is good for progression we never know. might unluck meth or smth

[8:55:25] quadity2: JP gonna be JP. Even without Marty there's gonna be issues

[8:55:39] artguychris: @EKANA_STONE completely agree here especially since when marty said he'd keep X in check was before he shot X
[8:55:59] coldeveryday: @EKANA_STONE they dont think martin is gonna be able to give up his relationship with jp
[8:56:14] EKANA_STONE: He shot the guy, what more do they want

[12:32:42] difficultsleep3r: Crazy that Erin is willing to do this for 10%.
[12:33:03] TastyKudzu: Just give people their kickbacks in washed cash. LUL
[12:33:26] lyfmobile: @tastykudzu thats crazy LUL
[12:33:35] aery679: was this the job that was supposed to get hot or it's just boring?
[12:33:37] Bill_Collector: Yeah washed cash kickbacks with a small incentive on top of they choose that
[12:33:41] xMike6: @TastyKudzu ngl thats dirty to do but might be necessary lmaoo
[12:33:52] lyfmobile: @aery679 that's jwellery run
[12:33:59] Bill_Collector: Kickback in washed + 5%
[12:34:02] aery679: ah ok thanks
[12:34:15] TastyKudzu: @aery679 It can be the hottest job depending on some factors that would be a little meta to say. DM me and I'll tell you if you care.
[12:34:17] misfit_justice: 250
[12:34:17] Firepokachu: the fact that octo has cleaned more than 200k is crazy
[12:34:21] xMike6: i hope it gets changed so u can do 25k at a time for a hot run
[12:34:23] xMike6: or more
[12:34:33] Stuckness: 500 is 10% too, poor octo getting 250 lol, most of his kickbacks must be from chopping surely
[12:34:33] lyfmobile: it probably made sense when the made that percentage but not anymore
[12:34:47] quote_me_if_horsen: 5k was good at the start of 4,0, but the economy is getting out of hand fast
[12:34:51] xMike6: Just like how jewlery changed, maybe this will too COPIUM
[12:35:03] lyfmobile: @quote_me_if_horsen yea
[12:35:03] tiffie2: What about a cleaning Thursday, get 6 people to do 3 runs each and that's 90k cleaned
[12:35:35] Bill_Collector: Need the tactical nuke for the classic driver swap
[12:35:59] Bill_Collector: Driver swapping as a concept is funny as hell
[12:36:01] lyfmobile: @tiffie2  the laundary day üíÄ
[12:36:17] TastyKudzu: Maybe that's the play.... 5 different people run it at once and Octo floats as a getaway swap...
[12:36:37] MiG76: Lang needs to do this once.
[12:36:56] obscurewill: yep ll
[12:36:59] ponzie3297: maybe a job for Si
[12:37:11] Bill_Collector: Si is getting caught 1000%
[12:37:25] Sssaap: just put this car on the back of a tow truck 4 Head
[12:37:28] TastyKudzu: Not just the cops. Other gangs that know you're carrying $5k on you.
[12:37:28] obscurewill: @ponzie3297 if the crew wants to lose 5k lol

[12:37:43] AnaklusmosDaze: LOL
[12:37:47] tiffie2: Yep, it would be the death of Si, he can afford a failed job
[12:37:49] MiG76: Lang does it once.. Octo getting his 10%
[12:38:01] tiffie2: Can't*
[12:38:01] ponzie3297: harrAww
[12:38:19] Bill_Collector: Money run in a truck maybe?
[12:38:26] TastyKudzu: I have to imagine they're going to add a higher stakes option like pawn in the future.
[12:38:44] mokoto05: HAHAHA
[12:38:44] ponzie3297: It make for a good watch
[12:41:06] tiffie2: This crew is so rich, a week ago they bought that big house and the crew is back to 300k
[12:41:48] obscurewill: @tiffie2 they owe Lang 300k for mats though, so crew really not up that good $$$ wise
[12:42:16] lunate87: Doesn't lang have like 400k
[12:42:24] lunate87: Yuno around 300k

[12:42:50] tiffie2: They used 200k personal so kickbacks can be paid, but by next week it will all be paid off
[12:43:04] megamanyvr: @lunate87 lang is poor now, he spent 300k on mats
[12:43:19] Clipperfan43: He will have it back tom
[12:43:29] TropicalToucan: @lunate87 lang down to 100Kish needs to be reinbursed to keep flipping mats
[12:43:38] JJqqz: @megamanyvr poor is kinda pushing it, he still have 100k
[12:43:53] megamanyvr: most of the mats were used for circuit boards
[12:44:02] jetpack_dude: holy shit we still grinding
[12:44:03] megamanyvr: for the crew
[12:44:35] TropicalToucan: How fast is the Circuit boards actually being crafted
