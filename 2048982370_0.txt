[4:06:54] legoliket: Def need more box fans for vent
[4:07:07] keikobeans: do the fans need pipes?
[4:07:56] scha_de: fans are just power I think
[4:08:23] legoliket: Mining racks started working after 100 cooling so 100 makes sense
[4:08:27] BigDutchBag: i mean i know IRL how to dry week but this is also a game
[4:08:46] BigDutchBag: you dont want cooling to dry weed
[4:09:53] NemisizZ: ngl, kinda wished the ppl behind this had an idea of how a grow op actually worked
[4:10:16] NemisizZ: cuz ur basically fumbling around in the dark trying to figure out the mechanics
[4:11:40] NemisizZ: because when u dry plants, the humidity usually goes up as the water vaporize from the plant, which is where the dehumidifier comes in and ventilation
[4:12:36] NemisizZ: 4 days isnt that bad tbh, its just having enough racks up so you can can cycle once a day
[4:13:49] NemisizZ: should also utilize the apartment, its free space
[4:14:06] scha_de: Time to figure out how much weed you can push in 1 day, and then spread it out NODDERS
[4:14:37] NemisizZ: yeah, like if u sell 2 racks worth of weed, then have 8 racks
[4:14:58] NemisizZ: lol
[4:15:33] NemisizZ: and it being a lot of trial and error
[4:17:35] keikobeans: heating must be for drying coke or meth
[4:17:39] keikobeans: cooling makes sense
[4:18:12] NemisizZ: heating would make sense for weed, ur vaporizing water
[4:18:54] NemisizZ: and the lower the humidity the more water it would pull out of the plant

[4:21:52] NemisizZ: yeah exactly
[4:22:30] thumphah: one person should max ventilation and other should max cooling. you also have to make sure to use plants that all started drying at the same time
[4:23:23] NemisizZ: yeah need different benchmarks to see what works the best
[4:23:39] NemisizZ: hard to figure out when everything is being added ontop of eachother
