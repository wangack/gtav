[3:18:59] forfiet: in hand
[3:19:01] the_only_tetra: @CarolineSwitched peepoExcitedHug Lovegers
[3:19:08] nebxhelix: Jenny should be commissioner
[3:19:14] CarolineSwitched: @the_only_tetra peepoExcitedHug
[3:19:14] ethanakky: jenny went to the dark side
[3:19:23] ancientpeas: The weather here has been so weird.  Plus 15 yesterday, minus 20 C last night.  Norm for this time of year is -3.
[3:19:33] evilmnkey4: thats not the darkside
[3:19:39] Juiicer: I mean, in the current state of the PD I'm not sure if some people want to come back. Esfand almost wanted Cornwood to get fired because he was frustrated at why Cornwood was getting DAP'd.
[3:19:40] ViewbotReportingforDuty: @nebxhelix more suitable to be liaison
[3:19:54] evilmnkey4: ruby york
[3:20:00] Sanivay: probably lots of paper work
[3:20:10] ethanakky: she joined Mick thats the dark side
[3:20:13] AnonymousOld: Lenny Hawk
[3:20:21] TheShaunBro: Dark would be good
[3:20:22] MDM4ever1986HD: who is the lady with the high pitched voice? I thought she was dispatch but she's EMS
[3:20:25] xDinkleBot: OMEGALAUGHING
[3:20:27] MDM4ever1986HD: AYAYA

[3:21:11] Bodybags87: I just want to see moon once sitting behind a curtain having to have a conversation between him as a mayor and him as lenny for RP reasons
[3:21:12] CarolineSwitched: I just hope people playing cops can enjoy their roleplay.
[3:21:13] Juiicer: Yep yep, Only up from this point for the PD hopefully.
[3:21:30] forfiet: @bodybags87 lmaooo that would be funny
[3:21:37] forfiet: one character having to play two at once
[3:21:41] caderrade221: snow for captain
[3:22:15] Juiicer: I still think the DAP system is ass. The statute of limitations being 30 days less than a DAP is kinda insane. I get holding PD accountable for their actions but for an RP content server its a bit much'
[3:22:25] MDM4ever1986HD: Cornwood would be great as sherrif but he's considered not taking it as he's seen a lot of shitshow when he's been a judge when he was suspended
[3:22:27] CarolineSwitched: Captain King does have a nice ring to it.
[3:22:58] ViewbotReportingforDuty: @Juiicer that will next mayor's assignment after he handled ruth's case

[5:26:11] Djepai: i put them in the fridge because there is space in the fridge
[5:26:13] unknown_paradox: if you think about it, supermarket eggs are not refrigerated in the UK
[5:26:14] bbq489: @StageName american eggs are different then EU eggs so they shouyld be in fridge
[5:26:27] LordXaras: @StageName in the US, eggs have to be washed to be sold, so they have lost their protective layer
[5:26:31] Zyphamon: @StageName ketchup for the hash browns not the eggs
[5:26:39] x_glazier_x: @stagename my eggs come straight from the chicken and I don’t need to refrigerate them
[5:26:45] Solidknight2112: So cool riding with Jenny again. FeelsStrongMan
[5:26:50] Zyphamon: hot sauce is for the eggs though
[5:26:59] LordofDoinks: @bizzleschwizzle Ty you for understanding I hate that I put farm when chickens are somewhat common animals for people to have just for eggs n
[5:26:59] EmrysorMerlin: Ketchup doesn't go in the fridge I don't care what the bottle says that's going in the cupboard
[5:27:05] Thatonekidmike: So how did King get to ride with Jenny?
[5:27:06] cocomantee: in the US eggs are considered people :)
[5:27:08] StageName: @bbq489 Yeah that makes sense @LordXaras @Zyphamon @x_glazier_x
[5:27:24] daveyquavey: @emrysormerlin at my old work place it was kept out for max 3 months, the bottle said it was fine
[5:27:26] 94dave: @EmrysorMerlin  i stand with you on every point
[5:27:27] Cuuley: People that don't refrigerate Ketchup are weird.
[5:27:32] Myiuss: @uhSnow whenever i raided in a hardcore/semi hardcore guild in WOW retail i'd listen to "The Toxic Avenger - My Only Chance (from Furi original soundtrack)"

[5:28:15] cocomantee: Just shoot them :) EZ
[5:28:18] Phoenix_Rised: @cuuley I guess I'm weird. Fun fact. When I go to a restaurant, the ketchup is at room temperature. Not cold.
[5:28:19] rhino0723: US refrigerate eggs cause of the way we wash
[5:28:26] Zechss_: tbh I blame chat

[5:34:34] Bakemaan: @nixety you did a great job! being thrown into the shit like that can be hectic !
[5:35:01] Juiicer: Did you want to start at the bottom because you were already in a super high position on Snow in 3.0?
[5:35:01] Cephyric: What is a PPO?
[5:35:13] nixety: @Bakemaan I assume the Abdul chase is a rite of passage for cadets. Appreciated.
[5:35:16] Zechss_: @Emaykurrz_ ITS YOU :@
[5:35:20] Azghaz: Solo cadet

[5:36:20] DanLGG: did I say parole?
[5:36:40] oldwrldblues: yes
[5:36:44] Neiara__: That’s why daps are kind of annoying sometimes , the people not doing good comms don’t seem to get punished

[5:38:47] Chrissy1337: you are fine Emay
[5:38:56] Zendorea: The issue with DAPs is that there is no corrective action tied to the punishment. so all you are doing is punishing and not teaching
[5:39:02] Azghaz: How does PPO practice comms when most of the time you abandon pursuit lol
[5:39:13] Bakemaan: chat Stare
[5:39:14] Emaykurrz_: did he even ban me? i didnt notice

[5:44:30] HallJams: if you got plates on the first incident I think it would make sense but it could have changed hands
[5:44:36] paudiiie: i understood they wanted you to add a screenshot of the plate scan to your report
[5:44:44] Bakemaan: @Phoenix_Rised you can become the new trash king
[5:44:46] daveyquavey: @phoenix_rised it’s honest work
