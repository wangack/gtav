[3:18:59] forfiet: in hand
[3:19:01] the_only_tetra: @CarolineSwitched peepoExcitedHug Lovegers
[3:19:08] nebxhelix: Jenny should be commissioner
[3:19:14] CarolineSwitched: @the_only_tetra peepoExcitedHug
[3:19:14] ethanakky: jenny went to the dark side
[3:19:23] ancientpeas: The weather here has been so weird.  Plus 15 yesterday, minus 20 C last night.  Norm for this time of year is -3.
[3:19:33] evilmnkey4: thats not the darkside
[3:19:39] Juiicer: I mean, in the current state of the PD I'm not sure if some people want to come back. Esfand almost wanted Cornwood to get fired because he was frustrated at why Cornwood was getting DAP'd.
[3:19:40] ViewbotReportingforDuty: @nebxhelix more suitable to be liaison
[3:19:54] evilmnkey4: ruby york
[3:20:00] Sanivay: probably lots of paper work
[3:20:10] ethanakky: she joined Mick thats the dark side
[3:20:13] AnonymousOld: Lenny Hawk
[3:20:21] TheShaunBro: Dark would be good
[3:20:22] MDM4ever1986HD: who is the lady with the high pitched voice? I thought she was dispatch but she's EMS
[3:20:25] xDinkleBot: OMEGALAUGHING
[3:20:27] MDM4ever1986HD: AYAYA
[3:20:27] 501warhead: Commissioner role's obligations arent really defined atm
[3:20:30] Nobbleberry: OMEGALAUGHING
[3:20:30] Narva95: KEKW
[3:20:36] Eatmypenguin: Reddit would explode if that happened
[3:20:36] Nojsty: imagine all the kids raging at that LUL
[3:20:38] Kshaway: he would self-sabotage so hard
[3:20:45] Smoogol: EZ indirect nepotism

[3:21:03] TGCZorn: Moonmoon said he is not touching anything as Max regarding lenny

[3:21:04] MDM4ever1986HD: @Nojsty I imagine them being toxic
[3:21:07] ViewbotReportingforDuty: yeah i find that jenny and simone in the same council would be great like max and siobahn
[3:21:11] Bodybags87: I just want to see moon once sitting behind a curtain having to have a conversation between him as a mayor and him as lenny for RP reasons
[3:21:12] CarolineSwitched: I just hope people playing cops can enjoy their roleplay.
[3:21:13] Juiicer: Yep yep, Only up from this point for the PD hopefully.
[3:21:30] forfiet: @bodybags87 lmaooo that would be funny
[3:21:37] forfiet: one character having to play two at once
[3:21:41] caderrade221: snow for captain
[3:22:15] Juiicer: I still think the DAP system is ass. The statute of limitations being 30 days less than a DAP is kinda insane. I get holding PD accountable for their actions but for an RP content server its a bit much'
[3:22:25] MDM4ever1986HD: Cornwood would be great as sherrif but he's considered not taking it as he's seen a lot of shitshow when he's been a judge when he was suspended
[3:22:27] CarolineSwitched: Captain King does have a nice ring to it.
[3:22:58] ViewbotReportingforDuty: @Juiicer that will next mayor's assignment after he handled ruth's case

[5:25:37] x_glazier_x: if they are fresh from the chicken you don‚Äôt need to.
[5:25:37] Cuuley: I just pull mine out of the the chickens ass and eat them.
[5:25:39] LordXaras: You don't need to refrigerate your eggs, unless they are washed
[5:25:41] daveyquavey: mine go in the fridge in summer only
[5:25:41] evil_bullett: just keep them out of the sun
[5:25:43] NeveRossa: KEKW jenny
[5:25:44] JustSteveThings: Mine are in the cupboard, i didnt know people put them in the fridge till now
[5:25:45] Lil_Miss1: I put mine in the fridge
[5:25:49] Zyphamon: eggs with the membrane don't require refrigeration. If they're like US eggs then they do
[5:25:56] bizzleschwizzle: @LordofDoinks True...we have chickens and don't refrigerate ours
[5:25:59] StageName: ketchup and eggs always go in the fridge as an american
[5:26:00] sagezz1: yes.
[5:26:11] Djepai: i put them in the fridge because there is space in the fridge
[5:26:13] unknown_paradox: if you think about it, supermarket eggs are not refrigerated in the UK
[5:26:14] bbq489: @StageName american eggs are different then EU eggs so they shouyld be in fridge
[5:26:27] LordXaras: @StageName in the US, eggs have to be washed to be sold, so they have lost their protective layer
[5:26:31] Zyphamon: @StageName ketchup for the hash browns not the eggs
[5:26:39] x_glazier_x: @stagename my eggs come straight from the chicken and I don‚Äôt need to refrigerate them
[5:26:45] Solidknight2112: So cool riding with Jenny again. FeelsStrongMan
[5:26:50] Zyphamon: hot sauce is for the eggs though
[5:26:59] LordofDoinks: @bizzleschwizzle Ty you for understanding I hate that I put farm when chickens are somewhat common animals for people to have just for eggs n
[5:26:59] EmrysorMerlin: Ketchup doesn't go in the fridge I don't care what the bottle says that's going in the cupboard
[5:27:05] Thatonekidmike: So how did King get to ride with Jenny?
[5:27:06] cocomantee: in the US eggs are considered people :)
[5:27:08] StageName: @bbq489 Yeah that makes sense @LordXaras @Zyphamon @x_glazier_x
[5:27:24] daveyquavey: @emrysormerlin at my old work place it was kept out for max 3 months, the bottle said it was fine
[5:27:26] 94dave: @EmrysorMerlin  i stand with you on every point
[5:27:27] Cuuley: People that don't refrigerate Ketchup are weird.
[5:27:32] Myiuss: @uhSnow whenever i raided in a hardcore/semi hardcore guild in WOW retail i'd listen to "The Toxic Avenger - My Only Chance (from Furi original soundtrack)"

[5:27:53] diuqs_: GIGACHAD
[5:28:11] StageName: @bbq489 I guess better to be safe
[5:28:15] cocomantee: Just shoot them :) EZ
[5:28:18] Phoenix_Rised: @cuuley I guess I'm weird. Fun fact. When I go to a restaurant, the ketchup is at room temperature. Not cold.
[5:28:19] rhino0723: US refrigerate eggs cause of the way we wash
[5:28:26] Zechss_: tbh I blame chat

[5:28:39] bbq489: @StageName idd Okayge
[5:28:39] Xen_Crypt: I think he was trying to decide what to respond/attach to, with the 911?
[5:28:39] X4320: i blame @Zechss_ SHRUGGERS
[5:28:53] Subo_ignorethispart: think he was just trying to get more units for different call and was trying to figure out severity of your chase

[5:34:34] Bakemaan: @nixety you did a great job! being thrown into the shit like that can be hectic !
[5:35:01] Juiicer: Did you want to start at the bottom because you were already in a super high position on Snow in 3.0?
[5:35:01] Cephyric: What is a PPO?
[5:35:13] nixety: @Bakemaan I assume the Abdul chase is a rite of passage for cadets. Appreciated.
[5:35:16] Zechss_: @Emaykurrz_ ITS YOU :@
[5:35:20] Azghaz: Solo cadet
[5:35:23] Zendorea: Wait.. i thought the 1st responder is "in charge" of the scene  regardless of rank
[5:35:26] Bakemaan: @nixety yeah the abdul chases are def a right of passage KEKW
[5:35:28] DanLGG: probationary parole officer I think

[5:36:20] DanLGG: did I say parole?
[5:36:40] oldwrldblues: yes

[5:38:38] Bakemaan: @abdirahmanmomo !backseat
[5:38:47] Chrissy1337: you are fine Emay
[5:38:56] Zendorea: The issue with DAPs is that there is no corrective action tied to the punishment. so all you are doing is punishing and not teaching
[5:39:02] Azghaz: How does PPO practice comms when most of the time you abandon pursuit lol
[5:39:13] Bakemaan: chat Stare
[5:39:14] Emaykurrz_: did he even ban me? i didnt notice

[5:44:25] Phoenix_Rised: @daveyquavey they outnumber me 10 to one. I work for them gathering foods for them.
[5:44:30] HallJams: if you got plates on the first incident I think it would make sense but it could have changed hands
[5:44:36] paudiiie: i understood they wanted you to add a screenshot of the plate scan to your report
[5:44:44] Bakemaan: @Phoenix_Rised you can become the new trash king
[5:44:46] daveyquavey: @phoenix_rised it‚Äôs honest work
