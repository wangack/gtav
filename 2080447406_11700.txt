[6:15:19] Binnbe: U can make bank Janjan
[6:15:26] MangoSrh: how much does January have?
[6:15:29] Robsubscribed: it's long but 3,5-4k is pretty good
[6:15:37] evanuris88: January definitely richer than April at this point
[6:15:40] vic_sensei_: so much learning today Pog
[6:15:43] 2heikki: @MangoSrh like 33k
[6:15:43] ReyeLyn: or is it 2.5k and then atm is another 1k
[6:15:46] zainoooob: 1 run of grime per day is good
[6:15:48] cozmisc: Does January have any financial goals/plans? A vehicle perhaps?
[6:15:48] Binnbe: @nanihanny Max dont play kekw. He did this job for 10hours straight one stream ;)
[6:15:48] robhtown: grime pays more yeah
[6:15:55] KevANiceDay: but g6 jobs are much shorter, but big cooldowns
[6:15:56] ajustus2801: april has a house though
[6:15:58] RaisenOx: the difference is the time cost
[6:15:58] CharismaModifier: grime pays way better
[6:16:01] caseynottracy: its about the same equally, grime takes a while. \
[6:16:03] bakeshield: I like trucking more than g6. the scenery and vibes are really nice
[6:16:06] ReyeLyn: ohhh yup
[6:16:08] MangoSrh: January is rich
[6:16:10] kalaksed: yeah, that's the difference. g6 is short runs, with bigger chance of robbery. grime is slow, but a lot of cash
[6:16:13] ninibinnii: g6 runs are shorter so you can do them more
[6:16:21] abbyycrossing: grime pays more but takes longer yeah
[6:16:22] silverminnow: Max is efficient NODDERS
[6:16:26] evanuris88: There’s a reason the Gworl’s House is in Max’s name

[6:16:47] Binnbe: @nanihanny Next to Yuno he is #2
[6:17:01] dimwit5098: G6 also lets you do more in the city. Do a short run, do some rp in the city, then do another run, etc.
[6:17:07] Binnbe: This job would be perfect for Lil Fooze and Lil Smitty
[6:17:08] LuciferRockstar: Pounder LUL
[6:17:26] jxcelive: Grime would be fun for lil smittster
