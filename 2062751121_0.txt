[2:00:14] bluej255: @cintr40 this is the way
[2:00:14] ronjeremy42069: no the bike just bounces off the pit too
[2:00:16] quote_me_if_you_came: where helicopter?
[2:00:16] Magicmooch: just make bikes high risk high reward - make it easier to be ejected from a bike at top speeds @EsfandTV
[2:00:16] DukieNukem: hear me out, transformer cop cars, from cars into bikes and back LUL
[2:00:17] itisacar: ratJAM
[2:00:19] JustinBeaver_: harder to chase then run
[2:00:20] Zenix_Drache: Bikes should be banned from chases on crimes IMO, solves the issue of cringe chases and allows RP still.
[2:00:20] mdhabe4321: Yes! Raise the fine by double for anyone caught escaping in a bike! simple. it ups the ante
[2:00:24] deftcg: @OPsux not right now,  they had a rental
[2:00:24] chmod_R_777: allow PIT after 5 minutes on bikes, so crims have a timer to do something creative
[2:00:27] Zenysa: cops need motorcycles in their pockets!
[2:00:27] Sizzlaa: VeryEs
[2:00:27] ShadyMashX: It's risk reward
[2:00:28] Janman88: @Jxckkooo they then do what? look angry at them?
[2:00:30] jd0x0: Need a bigger bike cop unit ES
[2:00:30] ozieman3o5: just use slower bikes for gangs
[2:00:30] stoneysoul: just get better? thats crazy to hate bikes that much you want them removed
[2:00:31] Sizzlaa: bikes are OP
[2:00:32] w111iam1: Pd bike slow af
[2:00:36] tnem3le: sitck in the spokes!
[2:00:36] HavocusRex: no air 1 yet either
[2:00:36] side_ofbeef: BMX is easy to get away on
[2:00:37] Jschip: they need cops that are always on bikes but also thats just a need more pd problem
[2:00:37] MexiBrent: @OPsux its a rental that goes like 90, just testing it and what not
[2:00:38] slothersz: So why don't theyt have Bike cops
[2:00:38] Nyctotherium: Just give the PD transformers that change into bikes EZ
[2:00:39] Cybernethik: leave bikes in game but make them illegal and very hard to acquire
[2:00:42] thewarth0g: make the bikes fuel burn really quick over the speed limit
[2:00:43] Lisava_: I always felt like criminals had the advantage, since they could plan everything out and the police can only ever react.
[2:00:44] Raja_Banhammer: just adapt 4Head
[2:00:44] HeyMeghan: simple. make a rule that you can‚Äôt swap to a bike in a car pursuit and only one car swap in a pursuit allowed.
[2:00:47] Kota216: Can a cop on a bike, shoot out a tire or a crim riding a bike?
[2:00:48] jackxanxcoke: lol
[2:00:50] redrum359: damn id smash mcnaughty
[2:00:51] deftcg: @stoneysoul 3head its not about the police being bad at the game lol
[2:00:53] JustinBeaver_: nerf bike speed and handling
[2:00:55] gurkken: No local bike just owned
[2:00:56] Kelborn: once the have helos, itll be more balanced
[2:00:56] TecxNine: if corn wood then corn should n if corn could corn wood !!!
[2:00:57] itisacar: should be allowed to shoot tires of a bike
[2:00:57] Atrix646: wats the rule of 6?
[2:00:58] avaell_: @EsfandTV what if they just make bikes go through fuel really fast and crashes on them auto k/o
[2:00:59] svartepetter: air 1
[2:01:01] n0oxaskek: so basically crims are powergaming making a car->bike swap
[2:01:02] MackPlays: To be fair the chase/catch rate irl for motorcycles is low too
[2:01:03] Zhachi1250: @Kota216 no its just chase till they crash
[2:01:06] Janman88: make the handling of the bikes really iffy
[2:01:06] oystrs: could make it only the big choppers, good for RP but slow for chases
[2:01:07] Syclone81: as a cop you never get 1year for holding a gun. so there is no need to escape or ?
[2:01:11] DanLGG: @janman88 I mean true it can be but it shouldn‚Äôt be so much about the W but more about being fair. Just like being able to break cuffs it gives them a chance where bikes don‚Äôt give pd a chance
[2:01:11] leomanechest: maybe just need a motorcycle unit
[2:01:12] Fake_13: bikes=Air1=more rage crims
[2:01:13] Zenix_Drache: @stoneysoul have you ever tried to chase a bike? its nigh impossible to actually catch them when they're ratty.
[2:01:14] Xierany: Bikes essentially ruin chase RP
[2:01:15] Beyondis: cant even stick close or youll bubble will knock em off
[2:01:15] TheCarnifex: heart breaking is not a good reason to get rid of something just because it;s tuff though imo
[2:01:15] GustavoK___: @stoneysoul it's impossible to chase bikes you dentt
[2:01:16] Jeeby: @Atrix646 crims can only have groups of 6 or less
[2:01:16] BradXeno: @esfandtv make lockpicks not work on motorcycles, personal motorcycles only. Full strikes and seizure of personal motorcycles used to commit crimes.
[2:01:17] BiggE005: Bikes plus rule of 6 Is crazy
[2:01:20] BreadyPudding: I mean look at dundee
[2:01:21] Sizzlaa: ghost rider and his hayabusa
[2:01:22] TecxNine: yeah buddddyyyy
[2:01:23] Jxckkooo: im shooting the back tire e
[2:01:24] redrum359: Cop Podcast change title
[2:01:27] ShadyMashX: Don't need to win every chase but enjoy the Ws u do get
[2:01:28] wolfgang_86: pepeW 10 swaps talk about that
[2:01:29] marneraiders: The real enemy of a bikes are locals
[2:01:29] Cybernethik: make bikes illegal and allow cops to shoot them on sight
[2:01:31] TheMah1337: The chase yesterday was crazy
[2:01:31] xtreme666: In rl bikers escape easly too
[2:01:32] biscuitz1776: does ssaab get to talk ever?
[2:01:33] PandaEatingCookie: best to watch when its that
[2:01:36] ozieman3o5: does the pd dont have choppers in 4.0? i never see any
[2:01:37] Zelluhs: bikes are boring especially from the viewer prospective.
[2:01:38] Aynese: i would say no motorcycles until the PD gets helicopters
[2:01:38] Arctic_JDM: That chase was so sick tho
[2:01:40] stachesquanch: So many good PD moments yesterday
[2:01:40] TheGodmother: Yes! It was great kekw
[2:01:41] stoneysoul: maybe ban car swapping. so whatever you start with you have to go all the way with it
[2:01:42] SurelyBaked: yeah the way you kept up with that was insane
[2:01:42] Luke_So_Good: How can you counter bikes? - Drones.
[2:01:42] leomanechest: also need a bike protocol - maybe you can taze them
[2:01:43] OutKast2: gachiBASS
[2:01:45] clowniusthe1st: biscuitz1776 hes probably eating
[2:01:47] Homonoha: PepeLaugh
[2:01:48] adch03: The speed from 0 to 100 in 1 block, small space getaways, and no pit says enough. @esfandtv
[2:01:50] CallMeToonie: KEKW
[2:01:50] n0oxaskek: irl if you resist on your bike you get tf tazed off it
[2:01:52] biscuitz1776: ahh ok
[2:01:52] Khaosshinobi: @leomanechest the problem isn't police swapping to them, they also can't even make arrests to anyone because they're solo, they can't carry the person they arrest, etc, it just nerfs the PD even if they had a bike
[2:01:55] spooli__: Jeez Saab at least let the others get a word in
[2:01:57] friedstk: a
[2:01:57] Offensive_Pink_Blob: well do what the police do irl and use helicopters
[2:01:58] auxjack89: 10+? Lol it was 6

[2:23:13] xseaka: the escalation SOPs are too soft, officers afraid of DAP?

[2:24:21] BelllGoR: it's also seasoned crims going against mostly new cops they just need more chases more practice and more cops in general
[2:24:22] wolfgang_86: Dps makes cops afraid and yea no one in pd had the oh shit its wrangler effect. Maybe ruth but she only has that effect on cops not the streets
[2:24:23] schLONG412: could cut it to t

[2:24:24] Rootbritney: Arent most scenes with 4 or less though?

[2:24:46] FLCK3R: like that heist people are doing,u can't have over 6 people doing it
[2:24:47] permacool: -1
[2:24:48] BoogieAnimal: I think that is what the current PD is going for the "We care" mindset they are trying to do. Which I think is fun because its a different PD and creates a different role-play. @EsfandTV
[2:24:55] areolagrande__: How did no one invite Nesk Duncaning
[2:24:56] Arcbound_Twerker: why isn't the RP podcast done in game? smh -1
[2:25:01] Janman88: @BelllGoR crims playing with well established chars was a mistake or a really big advantage atleast
[2:25:04] JustinBeaver_: I‚Äôm not a fan of the PD heli
[2:25:04] DutchMountain94: Bikes make a huge difference

[2:25:59] funkie: And then you have dundee that asks how much he would get for hitting a cop and smacks down 3 of them xD
[2:26:00] luxxen1: Isn't it the same with daps and getting fired as a cop also takes away a cop characters content right? The streamer loses something, which makes the daps way scarier
[2:26:02] xseaka: @wacker28 30 crims when there is 15 cops online? lmao

[2:26:13] DreamRider__: Take away all vehicles, everyone just runs and walks so  PD can stop crying
[2:26:15] Rasenpapl: @feraldog7 crims can only opperate in groups of 4 or 6

[2:28:04] aguy02: @feraldog7  BTTV is fine
[2:28:06] speedpax: thats because guns became accessible
[2:28:09] harbhub: cops arent robbed now because crims can make guns, thats the real reason
[2:28:10] OniZetsumei: gun jobs available too
[2:28:11] AnusReaktorMan: @esfandtv dean knows now PepeLaugh
[2:28:12] Fake_13: @TONK and i get him, i didt like his way of RP cuz of his attitude not his way of playing cop.
[2:28:12] xseaka: The adapting is good, just needs to happen fast enough
[2:28:13] 2Giii: not a fan of bikes and not a fan of air 1
[2:28:14] FilzG: Kapppa
[2:28:15] Otototo: Don't crims are able to craft guns ?
[2:28:18] ItsAHazardLife: I can see a rebalance being need. Though I also see the PD structure just failing too. The captains arent on the same page and they themselves need to be held accountable.
[2:28:18] pontiicus: streaming and chatting EZ
[2:28:23] Vexamas: @EsfandTV And I think this is one of the problems, **respectfully**, about pushing hard thoughts on balance without seeing the full picture.
[2:28:23] Bananarinno: to get normal cash its a 3hr+ process for crims
[2:28:27] itisacar: some people temporarily giving up on crime cause its just too much work to get paid compared to having a job and making more
[2:28:28] JustinBinder: voice crack LULW
[2:28:30] Capn_Stew: Amunation job helped lower cop robberies too.
[2:28:30] Aitchemdee: @Otototo first bps just came in
[2:28:31] SwillSwazz: there wasn't another way to get a gun than rob a cop
[2:28:32] philmagroin1: cops provide balance. it also takes more time to get spun up to deal with the crim load
[2:28:33] crispaynoodles: Not a fan of guns
[2:28:34] Aynese: but is this the PD adapting or just DOJ changing charges making crims second guess
[2:28:35] tinywulf: LASO

[2:28:44] thelariat_: I‚Äôm back. I can definitely say crims need PD and vice versa. it‚Äôs so fun to see the interactions
[2:28:47] Capn_Stew: Crims have other ways to get guns now.
[2:28:51] Luke_So_Good: maybe the 100k fine that came in is less of an incentive to rob a cop
[2:28:56] holyknightfran: sadge
[2:28:56] Luke_So_Good: at least a little bit anyway
[2:29:21] pontiicus: CORNMAN
[2:29:24] MisterGibs: @EsfandTV Major crimes should be a terrifying L.  You NEED risk.
[2:29:41] azncheesy: Kappa what oppurtunity more G6 runs?
[2:29:47] Cintr40: I think the Crims should respect the RP rule of "there's a gun pointed at me" I should valorize my life and stop. This rule seems only aplied to cops being robbed and civs. @EsfandTV
[2:29:51] Luke_So_Good: 30k to 100k fine did make criminals sweat a bit carrying/keeping the gun.
[2:29:51] 2Giii: I think there more to lose as a crim where as cops don't really take a hit
[2:29:52] jdotno: all the civs are crims in some way now

[2:30:12] thelariat_: @esfandtv can you link McNulty and Mickey‚Äôs stream again please so I can send a follow?
[2:30:19] guilt_: Of course that's your contention. You're a first year grad student. You just finished some Marxian historian, Pete Garrison prob'ly, and so naturally that's what you believe until next month when you get to James Lemon and get convinced that Virginia and Pennsylvania were strongly entrepreneurial and capitalist back in 1740. That'll last until sometime in your second year, then you'll be in here regurgitating Gordon Wood about the Pre-revolutionary utopia.

[2:55:52] Drakkasaur: what about giving cops fines or 24h suspensions/coaching/retraining instead of this dap thing where people are terrified of 'doing their job'?

[2:56:02] VincentsDeath: would it be weird if crims cant enable job if there is less then, let's say, 10 cops?
[2:56:06] sterred: @dankNbeans I just find it really DANK that he effectively got banned from NoPixel for some dumb stuff.. I understand for realism that cops gotta have consequences, but dont take the game away from people unless its REALLY REALLY bad, like breaking server rules Bad
[2:56:08] chivvyy: idk how pd is meant to be calculating all that mid-scenario atpCap
[2:56:09] Mogvvai4Sale: Tbf thats crims being good at what they do with what they are allotted. Crims push and things get nerfed, Cops kinda need buffs but can't really push.
[2:56:15] CrystalDimension: @MumblezWithaZ but.. something happened in game and now they're discussing OOC ?
[2:56:18] StormiNyan: balance wise it makes sense mhm

[2:56:34] imSteffin: @CrystalDimension, its a planned podcast.

[2:58:06] FLCK3R: LET'S TEST HOW THIS WORKS
[2:58:14] Quaggsly: cheesing it should be more restricted
[2:58:15] ZachFromChat: honestly cops being able to know when/how to treat people/levels of force is good.
[2:58:16] FLCK3R: fuck 30 seconds
[2:58:18] Duesbout: Then there's infinite money and no sink
[2:58:21] StormiNyan: peepoHey esfand
[2:58:23] suoicil: yeah you dont know for sure where the power dynamics are so shouldn't make that choice
[2:58:23] zorahul: that fucks the server progression
[2:58:26] Bannanabread04: @MDM4ever1986HD HUH
[2:58:34] sirsalem13: What‚Äôs the point of possibly being too aggressive in a situation like the crates when it could cost a cop their job, but there is no cost to the character taking it easy and only worrying about the hostage?
[2:58:39] NickMastaFlex: @theburgerpope TRUE
[2:58:40] ZachFromChat: If cops are really good at RP, the whole thing just works
[2:58:41] YoshiTheDeeno: @EsfandTV can a mod refund that i didnt mean to use it i meant to close it
[2:58:49] dankNbeans: @sterred he did not get banned.  he could be offduty with 130K banked, he's not going to starve.  i just didn't see it as an RP deadend, i realize that's just an opinion.
[2:58:49] clowniusthe1st: correct me if im wrong, but the economy is busted because of grinding though. crim calls a grinder for a supercar, chase over

[2:59:11] FLCK3R: good test :D
[2:59:14] owlx7: if they speed run.. then they're just missing out on making good RP
[2:59:22] Mogvvai4Sale: all peoples roles should be secondary in execution and RP should be considered first and foremost to promote the feeling of being able to engage with others imo.

[3:14:23] crystalinewolf: they've lost faith again for a different reason now
[3:14:24] Kiester_Felterbutts: Just change the punishment
[3:14:24] Sizzlaa: hachuWiggle kngGun give me all your cookies

[3:14:31] Smoogol: @nathankb_ I'm pretty sure he doesn't close the game
[3:14:32] avaell_: losing faith because police are too realistic KEKW
[3:14:33] dankNbeans: i mean, nobody says a DAP review has to take more than 48 hrs or whatever.  but if a crim risks going to jail for days, cops should have those same risks for breaking SOP.

[3:14:36] kyousukee019: There should be room for cops to do some out of line stuff without repercussions just not too much
[3:14:36] the_real_jfk: Ask him about daps lasting longer that statute of limitations
[3:14:39] rhaziaa: You can't just BS "leadership" though, and you can't play a "leader" if you don't have the skills IRL.  One of the hardest things to do in RP and all you get is shit for it.
[3:14:39] reichgeist: Cornwood stealing from the state
[3:14:40] M__Wolfe: Let me just ask, who holds the captains accountable?

[3:16:45] Arctic_JDM: SAJ
[3:16:46] Mogvvai4Sale: SAJ SteerR
[3:16:47] jdotno: The general IRL environment where cops have a bit of a bad rep(I know irl cops that are great, and I've never had a bad interaction with irl cops... bad apple, etc). And that bleeds in to rp, and its like a default to not trust cops.
[3:16:48] SurelyBaked: suspended**

[3:18:11] BrainJuiceSoup: oh shoot what happened
[3:18:12] 2dollarmouse: i think he felt betrayed and lied to, but he definitely acted inappropriately after the fact

If you dont want to play the other heros you will obviously go play something else, like any normal person would. The difference between RPing a cop and andything else is MASSIVE, they are not the same and I completely understand why he didnt CIV

[3:22:12] Waterbottels: I think viewers are more upset about the inconsistent punishment

[3:22:15] BigglesVII: All it would take is one PD gun plant and Shiesty would never be a cop again. Not worth the risk
[3:22:16] thelariat_: Den wouldn‚Äôt take no shit from other crims I think that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs afraid

[3:37:34] jdotno: The point Im making isn't that dundee is down bad or is bad at crime. I know he does it on purpose. I'm more shining a light in the incentive structure of the game. In character, there is no benefit for dundee  to provide that awesome rp, its just Whippy actually enjoys that part of it but a lot of other crims do not.
[3:37:34] CazkitXS: Problem with that is, giving cops their moment has setbacks. Giving crims their moment only advances them. and nobody wants setbacks. I agree with giving cops their moment though
