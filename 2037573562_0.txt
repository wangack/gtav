[1:21:37] krisanity_: 30 days in game?
[1:21:47] krisanity_: Oh jesus
[1:21:53] jackbrick0: through a judge or lawyer
[1:22:07] danxd209: You'll be gone for that long sadge ü•≤
[1:22:23] ghxstie_0: Is there anything you would change about the game?
[1:22:49] themask24x: So you think you will be in a court rp suing/ defending from crime?
[1:22:51] jackbrick0: u get the exspongement first then wait the days I think
[1:23:09] izurere: Heck yeah
[1:23:15] dannydoesschool: thats so wholesome
[1:23:15] valsmoochie: Is Japan going to throw off your sleep schedule?
[1:23:23] joshipgirl: blauGladge

[1:23:47] albaleks420: Why did u join rp no pixel and did it go better than u expected
[1:23:48] rylienaylor: i love how everyone is addicted to gta
[1:23:55] Bdog75: Kill Eli kill it‚Äôs time for a Villain arc
[1:23:56] Rynk1e: The points you get on your license are removed automatically, you'd think Felonies would be similar.
[1:24:11] valsmoochie: Whomp whomp
[1:24:14] wilder355: Anymore among us with the sidemen
[1:24:15] AyrtonS8: Who is going to Japan with you? Seems to be quite a few people mentioning Japan.
[1:24:17] danxd209: Josh since there's no mods around maybe pin a comment about detecting chat from asking about the Japan trip
[1:24:28] danxd209: Deterring*
[1:24:35] jackbrick0: or to find in rp ask a lawyer and they would tell u how to clean ur record
[1:24:58] AyrtonS8: No worries :D
[1:25:24] valsmoochie: You can ask Ramee
[1:25:33] AuburnMars: i heard koji thought abt being a lawyer that would be super funny
[1:25:43] valsmoochie: They cost a lot hahs
[1:25:46] Rynk1e: Try a 'Legal Aid'
[1:25:48] danxd209: Josh the Audi TT was OP. We need a super car in RP
[1:25:57] rylienaylor: isnt tanner a lawyer?

[1:26:25] danxd209: I'm becoming a lawyer irl lmao
[1:26:28] Lexyz130: court rp is surprisingly entertaining tbh
[1:26:30] AuburnMars: L lawering
[1:26:30] Fossabot: LDance
[1:26:33] Adam402: but it‚Äôs a lot of paperwork via discord lol
[1:26:37] jackbrick0: someone‚Äôs trolling u with 10k
[1:26:41] danxd209: Court RP must be interesting
[1:26:48] Hitijahubessy: You can always get yourself a lawyer provided by the state
[1:27:05] jackbrick0: and ramee up good hasn‚Äôt lost
[1:27:06] Adam402: @danxd209 what type of lawyer?
[1:27:08] themask24x: Have you watch any cops pov streams?
[1:27:08] Kesin86: I heard Rod do lawyer talk, and it is in-depth
[1:27:14] ipowerup: why am i hearing high school musical
[1:27:16] Adam402: yes filling out briefs was a lot of work
[1:27:45] danxd209: @adam402 Probably UK corporate lawyer. I'm in my first year of law school rn but trust the process KEKW
[1:27:50] wilder355: Would you rather vis or simon

[1:28:10] jackbrick0: a month he‚Äôs said
[1:28:17] Adam402: @danxd209 oh I enjoyed corp. ended up going down civil lit route but corp is fun
[1:28:28] preshhus: did you guys know that Ramee used to rap??
[1:28:38] rylienaylor: i thought i was hearing hsm songs! for sec i thought i was going crazy
[1:28:42] danxd209: @adam402 I'm studying Tort criminal and legal ethics rn
[1:28:42] mrtndlopez: Don't worry, yuno won't be in the city so you probably won't go to prison today looool
[1:28:46] Adam402: lil spitta yeah
[1:28:47] Marwheezie: Eli been getting his funny up not his money up
[1:28:58] crimsonbat1: Need to grind in those degen hours
[1:28:58] wilder355: Would you rather vis or Simon
[1:28:58] danxd209: @adam402 tort law is my bread and butter
[1:29:08] ivanreq: is purple Eli gonna come back? basilPlead
[1:29:11] jonathon_____: would you still be able to do chopping to get money?
[1:29:15] Adam402: tort I find most interesting it‚Äôs very grey
[1:29:16] corrieander: is Eli wanted from the police because of the car chase?
[1:29:24] Adam402: not black and white
[1:29:30] jackbrick0: all Ramees lawyer stuff is from the show suits as well haha
[1:29:32] AlexSJ23: Ramee charged 25k for his case yesterday
[1:29:44] EmrysorMerlin: You need to be a good reason to aswell to make it impactful
[1:29:44] AlexSJ23: 1k is to have him on retainer, its more for actual cases
[1:30:00] wilder355: Vis or Simon have to pick
[1:30:03] Rynk1e: Jackie Snow has been giving free legal advice. He's bar-certified.
[1:30:19] Rynk1e: Lockpicking Attorney he calls himself.
[1:30:24] danxd209: @adam402 tort is easy to understand. Duty breach damage.
[1:30:29] ricebowl: I might be a bit  late mentioning it , but hope everyone that's going has fun ! You have mentioned before , Japan is a place you wanted to go , it will finally be happening , so that's really exciting. Hope everyone enjoys the trip
[1:30:30] darksider_700: I feel luke ellum with a face mask would look dope
[1:30:38] sammncheesee: hihi yall
[1:30:58] danxd209: @adam402 I studied law in college so law in uni is easy for me. It's just a pain using Oscola referencingm
[1:31:04] danxd209: @adam402 makes it bare long
[1:31:04] EmrysorMerlin: @rynk1e snow a bit early for Eli
[1:31:10] ericnotestrada22: dude you‚Äôre going to Japan?? that‚Äôs awesome! hope you have a great and safe trip ellum!! <3
[1:31:11] interiorcastle: police rp is a bit like a soap opera/sitcom at the PD
[1:31:19] ricebowl: @sammncheesee Hello‚ú®
[1:31:25] Kesin86: Jeeves and Ellie, cop partners
[1:31:26] Bdog75: Who‚Äôs that what I miss
[1:31:33] Rynk1e: @EmrysorMerlin hawkaThumbsup
[1:31:33] krisanity_: +1
[1:31:36] david199915: SADGE we gonna missed eli
[1:31:37] rimuuu_: who are you going with in japan trip?
[1:31:37] ivanreq: is Bings gonna be hunting Eli down basilERR
[1:31:39] Adam402: lawyer rp is a lot easier than police rp imo
[1:31:41] floofyunicorn: Hi everyone lysBlue lysBlue
[1:31:49] Adam402: I couldn‚Äôt do police rp the call outs are hard
[1:31:58] Tyghurr: theres a lot of rules with police rp
[1:32:07] cozydarling: I could see you thriving in the police RP
[1:32:07] danxd209: The paper work is long
[1:32:09] ricebowl: @floofyunicorn Hello‚ú®
[1:32:11] docmabuut: The biggest problem in 3.0 was police breaking rules
[1:32:17] interiorcastle: i think all the PD in los santos are qualified lawyers
[1:32:21] jonathon_____: plus free-ish police car
[1:32:21] bigsmokeddog69: @floofyunicorn Hey PeepoHey elllumWave elllumLove
[1:32:27] snuffles000: You'll be decent chaser too
[1:32:30] EmrysorMerlin: Now I'm imagining jeeves and kay Kona riding together lol
[1:32:41] david199915: Lmao one last chase before you go to Japan Eli
[1:32:57] SirSolace: I actually found you from seeing Jeeves in other players POV. he was funny but seems like a harder character to learn the game on.
[1:32:57] david199915: Cop character is stressing
[1:33:00] JohnnyBThunders: kinda? LUL
[1:33:17] interiorcastle: @SirSolace jeeves was a good character to learn the drowning mechanics
[1:33:17] ivanreq: is Bings gonna go after the people who ocean dumped him basilERR
[1:33:23] crimsonbat1: Jeeves about to be ocean dumped on his first day again
[1:33:49] Kesin86: Any chance of Ellum joining Nathan Blau in LS
[1:33:57] Adam402: I feel like the funny thing about Jeeves is that he doesn‚Äôt have power
[1:34:07] JohnnyBThunders: LUL
[1:34:11] cozydarling: LOL
[1:34:14] ricebowl: üòÖ
[1:34:18] Shade_B: instant ocean dump
[1:34:55] Bdog75: At some point a throw away murder character to be as evil as possible? LOL
[1:35:08] gekkkomoria: @ellum how long will be japan vacation ellum ? when u will be back?
[1:35:11] MidnightW1tch: helloooooo
[1:35:25] interiorcastle: SAJ Jeeves has to join the PD in order not to be insta-killed LUL
[1:35:26] AluTheCrow: I mean, that sounds like my normal personality KappaHD
[1:35:28] SirSolace: it does, and will be amazing to see if you do go that route some time.
[1:35:44] david199915: That's what Dundee character haha straight up
[1:35:45] RivenSenpaii: Sounds like harry's cop Lil Kev
[1:35:47] ricebowl: @midnightw1tch Hello‚ú®
[1:36:05] Shade_B: you get banned
[1:36:08] interiorcastle: actually watching clips of Lil Kev would prob be good inspiration for cop rp
[1:36:26] Adam402: the clowns do disruption best
[1:36:32] Hitijahubessy: RP is all about finding a good balance between giving and taking tbh
[1:36:36] Lexyz130: yoooo I feel like Ellum would play a great clown
[1:36:38] Bdog75: Ya there‚Äôs a tasteful way to do it!
[1:36:47] fitzellis: a lot of RP servers have rules around serial killer characters, I.e. have to agree an end goal/motive with the devs so it comes to a conclusion and isn‚Äôt just random
[1:36:49] sunaooooh: Agreed
[1:36:50] interiorcastle: turning RP into a power fantasy isn't that fun for me to watch
[1:37:08] interiorcastle: that happened to a few people the last week or two lol
[1:37:14] Adam402: also Burn does good psychopath RP
[1:37:37] chasetv01: you could always make deposit runs ?
[1:37:37] Kesin86: Like if you bought a rental and someone got in and robbed you for it
[1:37:53] summerdaytae: you have a good view on these things blauL
[1:38:01] preshhus: imo, these types of servers only work when everyone is considerate of each other‚Äôs experiences.
[1:38:10] Bdog75: I was thinking more so messing with the cops
[1:38:17] rippin94: Can anyone remember how much Mike block robbed off yuno? It was like 200k wasn't it?
[1:38:25] MintRiver11: raia was robbed 3 times and that one time is just her key house which is a fake key
[1:38:28] specterskull: Like about JP and RAYMOND robing Raia 3 time over one computer selling 200$ Less
[1:38:38] jerkywerrky: I found it funny when people rob you and ask why you have lamps
[1:38:39] chasetv01: Civ take
[1:38:49] Shade_B: a character reached out to xQc and Ray the other day after instantly killing a cop and taking their gun with no RP behind it. That person is said to have been banned.
[1:39:33] Kesin86: I think a goog example is when the clown stabbed you after you punched him, but he still called EMS for you
[1:39:33] interiorcastle: the server's best when there are a bunch of civilians around making it feel more realistic. i wouldn't want to scare them off by using them as lootboxes
[1:39:48] SirSolace: you can make fun throw away characters but you need a good narrative or story. I saw some clips of someone playing a disgruntled drunk guy he perma'd him after getting shot by the cops which made this more serious dark rp for the PD.
[1:39:54] smallxfn: !followage
[1:39:54] Fossabot: @smallxfn smallxfn has been following ellum for 3 years, 4 months, 3 days and 23 hours
[1:40:04] chasetv01: I think you have to see from a criminal pov, they make no money being criminals right now
[1:40:07] Bdog75: Don‚Äôt do drama ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs for the devs man haha
[1:40:10] Kesin86: (on Jeeves)
[1:40:16] interiorcastle: that guy Coolio's fun
[1:40:20] rh1el: !song
[1:40:29] fitzellis: there also is meant to be a level of realism, albeit a bit mental, if you have to be scared every time you leave work or carry cash that ruins it a bit
[1:40:31] cozydarling: period
[1:40:45] interiorcastle: =British LUL
[1:40:47] rylienaylor: ray mond loves drama
[1:41:36] RJ13013: That is RP drama to have more storylines
[1:41:45] snuffles000: Bananabrea's ban lifts , her charater claire would have good dynamics w/ eli too i think
[1:41:59] interiorcastle: Ray Mond & April's tearful conversation was the best RP I've seen in 4.0. so emotional
[1:42:10] RJ13013: The Bis event opened up a lot of storylines and I think it is amazing
[1:42:10] preshhus: surprise! Josh is kind and considerate!
[1:42:11] Shade_B: it's like in GTA RP, punching someone verses the Synced Emote of a Fight that doesnt actually hurt
[1:42:12] zedecrem17: does randy ban lifts also?
[1:42:16] Elysian1209: you can tell its not rp if theyre also mad ooc
[1:42:17] jonathon_____: @snuffles000 I dont think that's gonna happen
