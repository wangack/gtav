[7:31:02] HeroLegions: Why can't he just do what he is doing? Do lawyer then do a second job like groupe6 on side?
[7:31:36] Athasin: @HeroLegions Because you can't be clocked in as a lawyer and do G6
[7:31:48] GhostyW98: @herolegions think the issue is when he’s doing lawyer he can’t do another job without signing out of lawyer and it’s not very well paid to start with meaning you may aswell just not do it at all
[7:31:53] Athasin: @HeroLegions And if he's not signed in he's not getting calls
