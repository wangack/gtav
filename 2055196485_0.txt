[3:27:06] boyboy242899: C you funny
[3:27:09] crafty279: i don't think he realises that that 7k he was talking about is 3 hours max at g6 vs 20 hours of sani to get the boards directly

[3:27:36] ZitroneSimo: grinding sani is a bit dumb because it will take you a lot of time to get mats and you will lose coins
[3:27:37] ProjectPain1: car
[3:27:43] raulc_80: Dont get manipulated
[3:27:44] andrefvm: Just tell him you don't want to do sani

[3:27:54] ProjectPain1: jayson buy her a car ok
[3:27:57] ProjectPain1: :D
[3:28:00] BorealisLumina: 15000 mats for 4 per is $60k, one G6 vault run gives $4k for the group, so it would be 15 vault runs for 15000 mats
[3:28:01] khanoute: sani has been buffed
[3:28:04] theace8869: Wouldn't it be better to grind G6 and and just buy the parts?
[3:28:05] tiptonator204: Jugular is amazing
[3:28:07] Tenivir: them doing tier3 jobs and just buying it is infinitely more efficient
[3:28:11] boyboy242899: just for himself. That why he had over 120,000
[3:28:19] mryoussen: and you have to check your rep cause you've been doing a lot of g6
[3:28:39] raulc_80: Sez him
[3:28:43] Davidcunha_: the problem is that he keeps all the money

[3:28:57] shadair23: sez him after dropping 100k on car
[3:28:59] mryoussen: @BorealisLumina EZ
[3:28:59] Tenivir: the problem stems from him desperately wanting to be top dog when noone else really has that goal
[3:29:03] rockozatza: but why does Jason keep all the profits, feels unfair :(
[3:29:04] tryhaaardau: let him buy it then

[3:33:56] SlampyFanBoi: vade3 vade2 vade1
[3:33:58] alphaanees: bro ngl this is a little annoying bro was always stating he was the house bank with the money and all the money from sales etc would be for the house. why buy car instead of full sending 9 more racks full of gpus
[3:33:59] Supersamss: vee not gonna pay attention PepeLaugh
[3:34:10] Tenivir: alphaanees yeah he just finessed them all
[3:34:10] BorealisLumina: G6 and buy mats is way faster if everyone contributes
[3:34:13] Dumi90: yea sani got buffed
[3:34:14] ProjectPain1: NODDERS
[3:34:15] StreamElements: NODDERS yuhh NODDERS
[3:34:15] guzeriz: 1500 boards is 6k$ you can make 6k $ in 2hours doing g6
[3:34:19] FRAlex010: 2k of this fault
[3:34:20] azh314: Shirley they wont get robbed
[3:34:23] TotDigital: @alphaanees so true
[3:34:25] suspectmids: @alphaanees oh lil bro you must not of been watching..
[3:34:26] Ginoveli: Businessge
[3:34:29] tryhaaardau: @Acie you can do for 8 hours so that Jason can buy himself a car for 200k next time
[3:34:31] Akumi1: does he know about the HQ app and robbery?
[3:34:34] Flashthatuuu: g6 is a lot of bs. You guys stand around in that garage for hours a day. Sani is a job
[3:34:37] AFFABLE__: If you are 300?
[3:34:39] Roro_____: @alphaanees actually true
[3:34:41] ProjectPain1: But hes not in our gang
[3:34:42] BorealisLumina: 1000 mats for one vault run
[3:34:43] Olvi12: your group could easily afford all the mats you need right now if you wanted to
[3:34:43] ProjectPain1: yeah
[3:34:43] fate024: Sani is not worth, 1500 mats is 6k, thats 3 G6 T3 runs
[3:34:44] Spikiekj: Heyy!
[3:34:46] ToTheSameHeights: that’s fair
[3:34:46] blackdoos: its gta RP, no need to farm anything
[3:34:46] SlampyFanBoi: its not very exciting
[3:34:47] metalcentaur950: yeah soul sucking
[3:34:52] boyboy242899: That why I never watch your steam because all you do is suin. And I watch the other group doing fun stuff.
[3:34:53] 1iwill: he should at least pay you half of what he'd pay patar for mats
[3:34:53] TotDigital: yea do it so he can buy another car ...
[3:34:53] Phasehero: @acie we are here for you no matter what you do! ❤️
[3:34:54] SlampyFanBoi: almost like a real job eh 8 hours
[3:34:54] ashleyferns: 2hrs with Levi is chill rest can be with group
[3:34:56] Crazyman114: I love sani
[3:34:58] PizzaGobbler: its not fair for you though
[3:34:58] Marilyn_1020: @alphaanees that is why some groups decided not to buy cars and instead used the money to progress
[3:35:01] blackdoos: making money together and buying boards is just as fast
[3:35:02] raulc_80: Dont just grind
[3:35:03] happylagoon1: tell him that
[3:35:04] guzeriz: 2k boards is 8k$ takes 2h, you can make 9k with g6 in 2 hours, so its not worth to do sani insted of g6 @Acie
[3:35:06] megasoy: You're grinding for Jason not the house though LUL
[3:35:07] jinhzoo: do the jp heist and find another family lol
[3:35:07] Kangaroo_Balls: If you got the fruits of the labor it might be worth it, but yo didnt get the car, Jason did
[3:35:09] Crewcabanger24: make him buy you a car when you get 15k boards
[3:35:09] VaeelL: too me it don't sound fair... you guys grinding the worse thing in the city and don't get money in return while he spam his T3 and get a car etc -_-
[3:35:10] mavericks312: you got a taste of freedom no one can blame you lol
[3:35:10] Tenivir: Acie it is RP to have fun, you dont have to do anything you literally already did the most for the house
[3:35:11] emrhys95: Jay zawn got that indentured servitude gaslighting on pat kekw
[3:35:13] Kenjack1984: @alphaanees those were inpulse buys and they didnt know they would need this much coin
[3:35:13] rodrigoleon111: combination of grinding and buying circuit boards from the others?
[3:35:15] AddyAdam: youre not being compensated for the materials so at the end of the day you dont have cash to get a car
[3:35:16] Azyraft: 4$ per is a good deal, just buy them
[3:35:16] MrLebowski_: Ask jason how much he has in his bank account PepeLaugh
[3:35:18] suspectmids: how is g6 not boring i am so confused
[3:35:19] np7092: that's huge
[3:35:20] umudoffy: What if you do for 2 hours for 2k mats. When it comes to the splitting you offer to buy it from them right there for cheap. You can do g6 after that. @acie
[3:35:26] henry_r3: Just rob G6 trucks
[3:35:27] Supersamss: Jason made so much selling , how about he invests some in components???
[3:35:27] raizzel_azzer: you grinded more than enough
[3:35:30] RayRey22: do that
[3:35:32] Aleron222: sani grindset GIGACHAD
[3:35:33] w0josh0w: @VaeelL ^ too true
[3:35:33] gruegd: The chaotic family hangouts are getting to be a bit stale imo.
[3:35:33] TotDigital: dont do it, he will buy another car with your mats
[3:35:34] raulc_80: Just but rtm
[3:35:35] guzeriz: jsut ruin sani and buy boards for 4$ and just do g6 @Acie
[3:35:35] lucine91: Buy and grind?
[3:35:37] DreamsPeek: And if you're using the time that you would be making money on getting something you're going to give directly to the house then there should be some kind of compensation if everybody's getting cars for each other and Jason's goofing about stopping now
[3:35:39] Zoledraiin: But lets be real the others aren't even close putting in the same efforts as u
[3:35:40] Dumi90: g6 gonna get robbed a lot starting today tho
[3:35:42] CRlCK: steal from John Pole ACTINGUP
[3:35:43] happylagoon1: tell him that 󠀀
[3:35:44] SlampyFanBoi: it makes sense to build up some cash so you can have fun later
[3:35:45] Stjilly: Get raia to do sani maybe?
[3:35:45] DylBKR: Rick Grimes boutta come for you
[3:35:46] Frostring: could just sell some of the boards
[3:35:47] Black_Griffin: i vote g6!
[3:35:49] PRE5TO_: its efficient
[3:35:50] ProjectPain1: How are you going to get money then?
[3:35:50] DylBKR: *grinds
[3:35:51] icecreamnuke: @suspectmids she hangs out with her friends
[3:35:54] LaCucaracha7: what did you get for yourself from all this grind so far?
[3:35:54] ItsLauraLee: I’m so confused lol
[3:35:54] boyboy242899: G6 is fun
[3:35:55] lucine91: They need to pay you for mats or you will be poor forever
[3:35:56] Kangaroo_Balls: its about whats fun for viewers too I guess, to maintain viewership
[3:35:57] raulc_80: Dont do sanni
[3:35:59] 420Gunna: can yall get robbed doing this @Acie
[3:35:59] StreamElements: 420Gunna, no
[3:36:01] Marilyn_1020: your going to have to charge something for materials to earn money then
[3:36:03] 3ndur3: just grind g6 for the same money and then use it to buy the mats then
[3:36:04] selvinn: sell mats to jason for 1-2 per so you get something
[3:36:04] bigtex494: And you want a car
[3:36:04] raizzel_azzer: you did the most you don’t need to do more
[3:36:05] fate024: The math says sani is not worth, 1500 mats is 6k, thats 3 G6 T3 runs
[3:36:05] Machinist757: even Clayton?
[3:36:07] 2wicked001: just run sani and rob g6
[3:36:08] megasoy: If you do it make Jason buy you a car. You paid for half of his with your mats.
[3:36:08] saelufuu: Tell them that they should spend their g6 money to buy boards aswell.
[3:36:08] 1iwill: Jason paying at least $2 per and Eugene paying back for the growing should be pretty good income
[3:36:08] umudoffy: What if you do for 2 hours for 2k mats. When it comes to the splitting you offer to buy it from them right there for cheap. You can do g6 after that. @acie
[3:36:10] Crazyman114: you can't make everyone happy
[3:36:11] pandamercc: You can't please everyone Brie
[3:36:12] rockozatza: gotta put yourself first :)
[3:36:12] TeaOnline: If they want to be civs why are they grinding for heist progression and not trying to buy a business?
[3:36:13] khanoute: Jason knows how to make others work for him, that's his RP character, ofc he'll manipulate CG members to do his bidding
[3:36:14] np7092: would vee ask for help buying a car?
[3:36:14] AFFABLE__: That other g6 truck runner ran to your truck just then, chznged direction when he saw the door closed. Susge
[3:36:14] raizzel_azzer: you did the most you don’t need to do more.
[3:36:15] ProjectPain1: How do you make money!?
[3:36:16] Daloo9: from your perspective, you ran Sani and benefited the house a lot, but you never really got compensated for it besides living in the house
[3:36:17] miscelaneous: make you happy the group will still love you
[3:36:17] M0hkofantti: G6 is not gonna be fun if crims start robbing them more when bags/pallets are worth more
[3:36:17] FiFO915: why not split the g6 money too
[3:36:17] Blo0dySalad: just hack in gta and mod in money ez 😎
[3:36:17] TotDigital: you do - this dick, fk him
[3:36:18] andrefvm: You need to be happy as well
[3:36:18] Tenivir: try making yourself happy same time, or prioritize who to make happy
[3:36:19] AceDeSpades: Need associate gang members that just grind sani
[3:36:19] ItsLauraLee: the game. lol
[3:36:19] Liink93: Ask him to help you with the car
[3:36:20] x_amer__: dont u guys also need someone with max rep at Sanni tho
[3:36:22] venyalorelei: Just run sani with nunu, raia nd grampa to?
[3:36:23] gruegd: I really like the house decoration streams too.
[3:36:23] chaosunleashed999: did you know anyone in the group before GTA RP? @acie
[3:36:25] Crewcabanger24: couldn’t you just sell them to the group for cheap?
[3:36:25] VaeelL: just don't do sanni he make a ton of money
[3:36:26] elM0ppy_: they can buy cars and progress at the same time, the problem is nick is making it seems like is his money and not everyones
[3:36:27] MadSertep: they do G6 and you sell them ur parts cheap to them, win win
[3:36:29] Machinist757: so must marry Clayton then. Only way he will be happy
[3:36:30] raizzel_azzer: you did the most you don’t need to do more!
[3:36:31] boyboy242899: You to nice and going do it. because you going feel bad
[3:36:34] GregorGDD: sell mats 2 per that way you make some chash and they get good price for materials
[3:36:34] Aleron222: @TotDigital chill lil bro kekw
[3:36:35] axmxixrx: TBH i really like civ gang but it all got boring cuz everyone is doing g6 all the time only grandpa is doing some crime thats fun and different
[3:36:35] raulc_80: You don't get money
[3:36:39] Bocha___: U and tolan should charge the house at least half market price for mats TBH
[3:36:39] 1iwill: just takes time to see the return...but it'll come
[3:36:39] Blo0dySalad: just mod in money Ez 😎
[3:36:41] elM0ppy_: no, u wouldnt either
[3:36:42] Roro_____: jason made his 180k buy selling stuf fbuild from your mats and bought a 100k car, tell him to buy mats
[3:36:43] Supersamss: well have you asked eugene for money from sells?
[3:36:43] Kenjack1984: if they arnt going to do sani with you they should contribute money to you.
[3:36:44] ProjectPain1: Tell them! you need money too
[3:36:47] Ricepatties: Buy your car first then you can grind
[3:36:47] ZitroneSimo: you should buy some mats now and you can grind later you basically lose on coins if you need to grind it
[3:36:48] DreamsPeek: The getting paid for weed actually works as a good model for the materials that everybody's contributing to each other there needs to be some payout for balance then everybody will be happy Jason needs to do his part in making everybody happy
[3:36:49] chickennuggets35: Just pull a Jean Paul, steal everything and dip
[3:36:51] KaBoomGodTV: u gotta voice these concerns
[3:36:53] megasoy: Jasons not gonna give you anything til ya call him out
[3:36:53] raizzel_azzer: you get nothing from the materials
[3:36:55] Tenivir: for weed absolutely
[3:36:56] RavagedPistol: you gotta request money for your own expenses
[3:36:56] swatson2703: nunu would
[3:36:57] andrefvm: she would
[3:36:57] SlUWAX: you done they much money for selling weed
[3:36:58] Kenjack1984: have you asked eugene for money from the sales
[3:37:00] fate024: She would, she even gave u for the kidnapping
[3:37:00] TotDigital: tell him to pay for your mats
[3:37:01] KennidyRae: she for sure would
[3:37:01] midzito: i mean talk your shit
[3:37:02] raizzel_azzer: EXACTLY
[3:37:02] RaverenZero: Buying for 4 per seems better especially since Vee saw little financial gain from sani. it went to the house.
[3:37:02] Stjilly: i feel like jason would aswell but not as much
[3:37:03] mavericks312: problem is nunu has to get to 100 rep the boring way first
[3:37:04] Crazyman114: you can go work snr buns xD
[3:37:09] FiFO915: @chickennuggets35 trueee
[3:37:11] LookItzJoe: The family needs to pay you for the circuit boards so u still have money too, either comitt to max stars sami or get a t3 g6 truck and everyone just does g6
[3:37:12] theace8869: The main problem. Is that Vee JJ doesn't see any of the profits of what Jason and the others do
[3:37:12] girlballor: so all the money the group has is from pc sells. you did all the farming for the mats to make pc
[3:37:12] raizzel_azzer: EXY
[3:37:13] swatson2703: everyone takes advantage of you
[3:37:13] metalcentaur950: yeah its just crap nato because they need rep on the turf so they no
[3:37:14] x_amer__: and also decide which car @Acie
[3:37:15] SupportYourLocalLurker: the amount of money you and Tolan have lost giving stuff away is crazy
[3:37:16] chaosunleashed999: grandpa and raia is crazy and funny to watch
[3:37:20] raizzel_azzer: EXACTLY
[3:37:22] raulc_80: Get that money from Jason
[3:37:22] gruegd: It might be a good idea to talk as a group ooc what works content wise and not.
[3:37:22] VaeelL: she give you 5k for that hitman job ofc she will
[3:37:23] DaleGribb1e: tell jason to buy u a car then do sanni
[3:37:24] jas3y: time for vee to put her little foot down
[3:37:24] mavericks312: nunu has no problem giving ppl money she gave like 30k the last week
[3:37:27] miscelaneous: weed is shit
[3:37:28] Tenivir: Nunu would go out of her way to not profit off of it for you
[3:37:31] midzito: tell jason to give u 10k right meow
[3:37:35] Kenjack1984: you have to talk to eugene
[3:37:35] ProjectPain1: Hang out with grandpa he can make u money @Acie lol
[3:37:35] Alaineman: Eugene is still selling it but it takes a long time as 1 person
[3:37:36] Mr_Tvi: How many bags did you give grandpa?
[3:37:37] niqqqita: You spoil Jason. Nunu gave him lots of money for his t3 truck and She paid for his car improvements. Now she is down in money and way back to get her own car
[3:37:38] Gdude460: Should call a house meeting to air all this out
[3:37:41] TotDigital: you just grind and they profit and you dont get shit
[3:37:46] shadair23: selling is trash tho
[3:37:47] MonkeysUnkle: Voice your concerns
[3:37:47] tryhaaardau: A few G6 runs are more profitable than a week on the weed
[3:37:47] theace8869: Jason needs to pay VEE JJ. Like he cant keep getting that stuff for free
[3:37:48] theoldshuck43: ask her to
[3:37:51] DreamsPeek: Well if Jason and Grandpa are awake between one of them they could probably get V paid today
[3:37:51] metalcentaur950: pogo puff
[3:37:53] Dumi90: the problem with nunu is she cant farm rep ... too adhd
[3:37:54] raizzel_azzer: if you sold the mats instead hou would have been the richest
[3:37:55] Alaineman: Nunu can't sell the PogO puff in turf, she is not master seller
[3:37:55] PRE5TO_: nunu has to be max rep in selling to sell pogo puff
[3:37:56] crafty279: with 3 and soon 4 tier 3 g6 trucks you make enough for 4000 circuit boards in 1 set of 20min runs
[3:37:56] Kenjack1984: doesnt nunu need to get her rep up befor selling
[3:37:57] miscelaneous: Nunu aint gettin 100 rep no way
[3:37:57] FRAlex010: @acie just do the math they get 2k per person oké and it’s in 20 min 2k sani is 8 k money if you buy them for 4 per just spank g6 make a lot grind for another t3 and buy the mats
[3:37:58] ZitroneSimo: selling is boring thats why eugene is not doing it
[3:38:01] Phasehero: Nunu would give you money! She gave you money for that job cutting that guys finger. @acie
[3:38:05] mmmurple: I don't think nunu has the patience to sell
[3:38:05] Frostring: eugene hasnt made anything from weed either tbf LUL
[3:38:08] metalcentaur950: vade3 vade2 vade1
[3:38:10] mavericks312: ppl have actually spent more money to help Jason recently then the other way around
[3:38:11] Flashthatuuu: Do what you want but I don’t get why G6 is that much better from a viewer perspective.
[3:38:13] Estupe2: Hi Acie
[3:38:13] Ginoveli: acieWADDLE
[3:38:15] guzeriz: @Acie sani is just not worth it math does not work, 2k boards for 2 hours is less money wise then 2h of g6, just do g6 and buy boards.
[3:38:24] tryhaaardau: @Frostring true
[3:38:27] Tigerlilee21: Ask grandpa about when you are getting paid. Nunu loses money with chopping.
[3:38:31] Alaineman: Vault runs are just the best
[3:38:32] Tenivir: but why its the same thing
[3:38:34] SlampyFanBoi: crime is the slow burn right now, its not about the money, more about the experience, money isnt everything in Rp
[3:38:34] Olvi12: time is money
[3:38:35] FRAlex010: they will he just say it
[3:38:35] Tenivir: time vs money
[3:38:36] DreamsPeek: Then maybe they don't want circuit boards that badly
[3:38:39] crafty279: with that math they need to
[3:38:40] fate024: If u want progression u need to spend money
[3:38:40] Alaineman: and normal runs/atm are good too
[3:38:40] MrLebowski_: jason* not they
[3:38:40] andrefvm: If everyone helps pay for the boards, its easier
[3:38:41] raizzel_azzer: buying is so much better
[3:38:42] mryoussen: yeah your time is money
[3:38:43] DylBKR: Been a while since a house meeting feels like maybe that needs to happen
[3:38:44] ProjectPain1: tell them to pay you money for sani time @Ace1507
[3:38:44] nykter1: Its pretty much the same tihng
[3:38:44] FRAlex010: if it’s 4 we can buy them
[3:38:46] 1iwill: they will have to if they want to vamp up the rack and gpu production
[3:38:46] Phasehero: And you just stabbed and shot.
[3:38:46] ZitroneSimo: you have 3 T3 trucks they can spare one run
[3:38:47] MonkeysUnkle: then they have to pay U
[3:38:48] chaosunleashed999: is there a job that you really want to do?
[3:38:49] DreamsPeek: @olvi12 🙏
[3:38:50] uxie____: so they want you to give them 10k worth of boardsa day, but they keep all their g6 money?
[3:38:53] VaeelL: that the problem Jason keep spamming T3 for his own bank account
[3:38:55] rockozatza: that's his problem then, not yours
[3:38:55] midzito: @crafty279 isnt it more about having rep all around so the crew can have all shit around depending what the next unlocks are?
[3:38:59] Tenivir: they want to use all your time rather than spread it out, literally anyone can see its unfair KEKW
[3:39:01] bluff1n: sell him the boards
[3:39:03] TotDigital: then they have to pay for your time and mats
[3:39:06] tryhaaardau: @Acie Eugene does weed all the time, and he has less money than you
[3:39:07] ashleyferns: In the long run, it doesn't matter as long as you are enjoying
[3:39:09] FiFO915: prob need a seperate business acount
[3:39:12] x_amer__: oh RAIA wanna be a sanni worker or what
[3:39:15] Xian_TV: yeah you should be making money in this as well
[3:39:18] Dumi90: @midzito yes but this gang will soon fall apart
[3:39:19] DreamsPeek: If anything Jason with more money is less happy than Jason pursuing money
[3:39:21] happylagoon1: tell him that
[3:39:22] Skubyx22: money is proabably always better until a new mechanic comes out and mats price spikes
[3:39:24] Phasehero: Jason doesn't want to " remake" the money buying
[3:39:27] raizzel_azzer: buying them is more worth
[3:39:28] Kenjack1984: charge them 3 per circuit board. they are getting a deal and your are paid
[3:39:28] metalcentaur950: im sure if you talk with gramps he'll sort you out
[3:39:29] girlballor: so you made the materials for the group to make pc's that nick sold and then pocekted the money and bought himself a car. what we have here from nick is the polom gaslight. asl malena about the knives she bought from donations that she got to buy knives and nick making her feel like shit about it
[3:39:30] midzito: @tryhaaardau bro he has 2 cars
[3:39:31] Supersamss: you need to get paid or something from JAson if he wants you to farm  all that shit alone @Acie
[3:39:31] KaBoomGodTV: Jus start robbin G6 truck n buy mats lol
[3:39:33] mavericks312: after jason idk who has the most money now
[3:39:33] GregorGDD: jason can talk with lang for good prices on materials
[3:39:34] Jackpic07: -1
[3:39:35] boyboy242899: You just getting fuck in the butt hole. For doing sanni
[3:39:35] justCoopp: -1 text

[3:39:57] lemonsANDlemurs: Negative one
[3:39:57] brandonsux: OMEGALUL

[3:40:31] FRAlex010: I think it’s better to buy
[3:40:33] Tenivir: Olvi12 yeah its literally the same thing except he wants vee to spend all the time instead of all of them with g6 money
[3:40:36] FRAlex010: lissen to this
[3:40:38] Freppuchino: You have to get paid if he wants you to go sanitation
[3:40:43] emrhys95: Maybe patar will cut vee a deal instead
[3:40:49] umudoffy: Why not sign a big contract with Lang Buddha
[3:40:52] midzito: wdym cant anything about it, talk your shit
[3:40:54] suspectmids: fuckkkk jason am i right chat
[3:40:55] kais_98: we love raia
[3:40:56] 1iwill: definitely think the best for you would be to do the sani for the group, but they have to pay you for your work
[3:40:56] boyboy242899: Clayton and Jason making good money at g6
[3:41:04] ProjectPain1: You need to be taken care of too
[3:41:08] momzzyy: Im lost isn't grinding g6 and buying the mats much better or nah?
[3:41:11] crazyiitopii: Only compromise is gonna be making someone pay for your materials
[3:41:16] RavagedPistol: even if it is at cost, its better than no money
[3:41:17] SlampyFanBoi: canada rules, you can postal mail marijuanna

[3:41:33] DylBKR: G6 Power Puffs need to form a union against Jason
[3:41:39] icecreamnuke: so he don't want to spend his money but you have to work
[3:41:40] guzeriz: just farm g6 i dont understand why you even thinking about this, math is clear that g6 and buy mats is way better then just doing sani time wise, doing sani is just wasted time @Acie
[3:41:47] joyoruz: i mean talon is in union right
[3:41:48] PRE5TO_: ????
[3:41:48] TeaOnline: we Sure

[3:41:54] FRAlex010: tell him to do it him self then
[3:41:55] niqqqita: You had to pay the 5k cash for the taxes. Nobody considered your contribuition in materials
[3:41:56] guzeriz: 1k
[3:41:58] RavagedPistol: efficient for his wallet
[3:41:59] theoldshuck43: you are not him
[3:41:59] Xian_TV: you should just tell them you want a cut of the money ez
[3:41:59] Supersamss: "we" sitting on sani ICANT

[3:42:26] JeongyeonsWorld: you're the one doing sani not him
[3:42:30] Marilyn_1020: what are you guys using the materials for
[3:42:31] DreamsPeek: @kangaroo_balls Nick does that some , yes. And Jason if he's going to be the family bank and people are going to turn over their full package to him needs to have some way of withdrawing money
[3:42:31] M0hkofantti: Dont forget the split
[3:42:33] scarves: its not ""we" he is trying so hard to force you to do that
[3:42:34] Saburbss: brie stop letting jazzzon gaslight you
[3:42:34] tryhaaardau: like 15 min G6
[3:42:36] crafty279: that was between 2, which would need splitting
[3:42:38] Xian_TV: @boyboy242899 weirdo

[3:42:55] Roro_____: they split it tho
[3:42:56] boyboy242899: Jason never say I do it too
[3:42:57] vazeline__: @boyboy242899 weird behavior
[3:42:57] DreamsPeek: @momzzyy I'm lost on that exact point, I don't know mathematically what's the downside of funding circuit boards with G6 or materials or whatever
[3:43:01] justCoopp: @claraatwork, i did i told her to check disc she didnt see the message yet
[3:43:05] Spikeboomer: he said 1000 cuz of split @acie
[3:43:07] manofstill47: PopNemo
[3:43:12] andrefvm: Raia also has 200
[3:43:21] pingobuh: Why would she want a t3 when crime is better now?
[3:43:22] BorealisLumina: One vault run is 1k mats if you pay 4 per (15 mins work)
[3:43:24] guzeriz: its 4$
[3:43:24] Roro_____: not per person, u gotta splitt it
[3:43:27] claraatwork: @justcoopp eeeee I’m crying
[3:43:34] GregorGDD: if she get busted from the police there is a chance she got banned from G6
[3:43:39] tryhaaardau: G6 = 4k 15 min
[3:43:39] toefi007: then she gets caught for a crime and the t3 is dead -35k LULW
[3:43:40] Dumi90: call levi
[3:43:41] guzeriz: thats 4000$ in 2 hours, you make that in 40 mins with g6 lmao
[3:43:41] x_amer__: u can ask levi
[3:43:41] Bocha___: Patar
[3:43:43] M0hkofantti: He does not know how the sani shit works
[3:43:44] cgHaddy: ask patar
[3:43:46] Tenivir: the difference he is not getting is it is everyone putting in work vs just Vee putting in work
[3:43:46] Dumi90: ask levi or patar
[3:43:46] justCoopp: @claraatwork, im waiting for a down time to try again, she needs to see it, its so cute LUL
[3:43:49] FRAlex010: naaaa
[3:43:58] HandofOdd: @TSM_ImperialHal Oh god, try again lol
[3:44:06] x_amer__: call levi
[3:44:06] DreamsPeek: pandao200iq
[3:44:07] raizzel_azzer: ask patar
[3:44:09] Supersamss: the real truth is ,it is way better to do g6 and buy that shit
[3:44:11] AddyAdam: yeah but they pocked the cash
[3:44:16] ZitroneSimo: why not do both, buy some and grind
[3:44:16] guzeriz: but g6 is best money lmao
[3:44:19] RavagedPistol: you also need money LUL
[3:44:24] jaswho2: you need money in your pocket!
[3:44:27] Revy_98: so what do you get for your time handing the mats over
[3:44:34] ashleyferns: Jackass still hasn't given Vee her share of the money
[3:44:38] raulc_80: Yes
[3:44:38] kais_98: ughhhhhhh lol
[3:44:39] lemonsANDlemurs: Also your sanity
[3:44:45] tryhaaardau: 0
[3:44:48] guzeriz: why the fuck would you do sani if g6 is better money buying boards is faster the ndoing sani why waste time doing sani omE
[3:44:49] wolfinvans: yo
[3:44:49] bluff1n: u loose out on anything cool that s new at sanni
[3:44:51] mryoussen: talking efficiency it might be more time efficient to put in a day of G6 as a groupe and get all the boards you need
[3:44:51] STONASESS: this aint fair
[3:44:52] umudoffy: You make no money
[3:44:54] Skubyx22: depends on mat cost at the time also
[3:44:54] henry_r3: You don't make money!
[3:44:56] raizzel_azzer: and then you have to pay for bills too
[3:44:56] boyboy242899: Jason is just pice of work
[3:44:57] CRlCK: brb pee pees
[3:44:57] momzzyy: @DreamsPeek yeah literally running g6 with two tier 3 runs and regular g6 runs between and buying the mats seems more convenient to me
[3:44:58] Spikiekj: but if G6 gets nerfed ur f’d
[3:45:00] FRAlex010: you don’t make money because you don’t get the money
[3:45:03] STONASESS: u need to be paid for circuit boards
[3:45:04] hourtempo: its better for 300 rep only no-'
[3:45:05] Bah4life: why should not you make money?
[3:45:05] heyzus242: you make nothing you donate lul
[3:45:05] Rollo_TT: @CRlCK ACTINGUP
[3:45:05] elM0ppy_: you are right vee
[3:45:05] andrefvm: But at sani you make no money
[3:45:05] DreamsPeek: @lemonsandlemurs
[3:45:08] GeneralTragedy: but you make no money at sani, because you give them the materials
[3:45:08] pingobuh: He needs to pay u for doing sani lol
[3:45:08] doza107: tell him
[3:45:09] M0hkofantti: Sani is about $2k worth of mats in hour with 250 rep
[3:45:11] GeneralTragedy: say that
[3:45:12] joyoruz: def need the contract
[3:45:13] nykter1: Tell him that
[3:45:15] nikulaz_: so tell him that
[3:45:15] kais_98: the three girls should work towards a 3 tier truck
[3:45:15] RavagedPistol: then tell him
[3:45:16] Jetrospect: Gonna have to average down bc the HDMI clay and raia duo lol
[3:45:16] miihxh: say tgat
[3:45:16] FRAlex010: so yeah for him it’s better
[3:45:17] gruegd: That material prices are variable too.
[3:45:18] ProjectPain1: @henry_r3 she wants money and company...
[3:45:18] Bocha___: The only good person with maths is clay but not awake Saj
[3:45:19] henry_r3: He needs to pay you!
[3:45:19] girlballor: you make zero he makes money from you running and he doesnt py you anything
[3:45:19] nikulaz_: You're dancing around that
[3:45:19] STONASESS: youve already given probably 100k of materials to the house
[3:45:22] yourguyzuds: Jayson nmp7
[3:45:24] Supersamss: make him pay you
[3:45:24] AddyAdam: what does he not understand that you are left broke
[3:45:26] np7092: and you need money fro a car
[3:45:28] DreamsPeek: Sounds silly but There must be balance or there is imbalance
[3:45:30] bluff1n: do what u want or you'll just get bored
[3:45:31] crookz_n_castlez: and it's boring
[3:45:32] Villenthessis: Jason really needs to compensate you for the mats NODDERS
[3:45:33] sabwenaa: Tell him he needs to pay you
[3:45:34] chaosunleashed999: vee is not trying to do sanny LUL
[3:45:35] Spikeboomer: @acie tell him its more enjoyable for you too because g6 is what everyone in the family does it
[3:45:35] 2wicked001: you worked hard for jason's new car
[3:45:39] andrefvm: Just do g6 and slip the costs for the mats
[3:45:42] Capt4inJuli: if he wants the racks fast he needs to buy as manny as possible
[3:45:42] Freppuchino: might be backseat but he should pay you
[3:45:43] keeesh: have the family buy mats at a super cheap price from you
[3:45:43] guzeriz: sani is 2k an hour and g6 is 6k an hour, thats litteraly 3x more mats an hour doing g6 and buying them @Acie
[3:45:44] RavagedPistol: as he gets rich LUL
[3:45:44] lemonsANDlemurs: And it's mind numbing
[3:45:45] Linds_Brohan: At this point Civ Gang should pool to buy you a car
[3:45:45] AddyAdam: he needs to pay you
[3:45:46] raizzel_azzer: and it’s boring
[3:45:46] chaosunleashed999: sanitation
[3:45:49] PizzaGobbler: this fucking guy
[3:45:49] Saburbss: "I get it, but I don't care because this is what I want to do"
[3:45:49] RealWicari: and you need levi/charlie/patar to even do the runs
[3:45:51] Xian_TV: tell them to buy you a car with the "group" money then ez
[3:45:54] Tenivir: he gonna be stuck on this fix JP competition now ICANT group doomed
[3:45:54] CobraKaifromHawaii: make the group pay for your work at least partly
[3:45:54] Phasehero: I understand what he saying but you lose out on gang time.
[3:45:56] bootssncatss: YOU NEED MONEY hasL hasL
[3:45:56] x__sabrewulf__x: Have Jason's b ass run sani
[3:45:58] AgadhiTheGreat: Raia LUL
[3:45:58] n0ux_: just grind sandy and sell jason mats for 2 a pop, everyone wins @Acie
[3:45:59] Zoledraiin: But everyone got cars yet u are just being their workhorse with nothing to show for it
[3:46:01] Azyraft: if he really wanna catch up then he should buy the materials now
[3:46:03] sunnyskies23: let tolan get in this convo too he’s a little more upfront about how he feels lol
[3:46:03] Zyye_: raia lol
[3:46:04] pingobuh: And make money
[3:46:05] Bah4life: could jasooon buy mat from u?
[3:46:08] RaphaelCraZyFive: peepoFlower acieStar
[3:46:08] glorfindel1111: What he is he doing
[3:46:10] PezeM: @guzeriz yeah g6 is 50k per hour, what are u smoking lil bro
[3:46:10] TotDigital: he will have money, you dont get shit
[3:46:11] deltron__: Jason should be giving you money from his GPU sales
[3:46:12] tryhaaardau: Only Jason would have a lot of money, no one else would have seen that money
[3:46:12] Ginoveli: acieBOUNCE
[3:46:14] niqqqita: You need a company bank account to pay for these things. Só everybody would put the same money into it
[3:46:18] ashleyferns: Rhino SAJ
[3:46:20] VaeelL: he has near 100k on his bank he just don't wan't to spend it that it...
[3:46:21] Crewcabanger24: they just need to pay you
[3:46:23] TotDigital: stop being so naive
[3:46:24] AddyAdam: then he needs to pay you
[3:46:31] ANTiN0VA: work a deal where you do sani but jason buys you wantever you want
[3:46:31] suspectmids: @Bah4life that just defeats the purpose if they are in the same group
[3:46:33] shadair23: jason can do sani
[3:46:36] STONASESS: he needs to pay you for yopur time
[3:46:37] Kangaroo_Balls: Jason needs to buy you a car first cuh
[3:46:38] ZitroneSimo: if you want to catch up you need to buy mats, otherwise it will take a lot of time @Acie
[3:46:39] guzeriz: I dont fucking understand why this is even a discusion when g6 is 3x cash and you just buy the mats and you save 3x on time insted doing sani omE
[3:46:41] Supersamss: not true
[3:46:42] Freppuchino: please make him pay you AAAA AAAA
[3:46:44] elM0ppy_: he has to pay @Acie
[3:46:44] MaxaMinor: You need someone with 300 sanity rep to make it worth it. So run it when they're available and do g6 other times
[3:46:44] nykter1: sell them half price or something, so you get some pocket money atleast
[3:46:45] azurevein: just ask him to pay you the price of the stuff
[3:46:50] Olvi12: nah mats will always be good but so will money
[3:46:53] 42arc: maybe Patar can join the house finally?
[3:46:54] np7092: g6 is slowly getting nerfed too
[3:46:55] leczxm: actually gaslit u LULW
[3:46:55] boyboy242899: Just basically telling you to do it that’s it
[3:46:56] Liink93: if one day G6 is nerfed...
[3:46:57] glorfindel1111: Why can't he pay
[3:46:58] Alezzo: @Acie Do G6 as a group. All pitch in, buy the mats. Otherwise you alone pull for the whole group, it's just neither efficient nor fair. Spam those Tier 3 truck runs once you have 4.
[3:47:03] Azyraft: @guzeriz exactly...
[3:47:04] willowompoo: ask them for money then nmpHumm
[3:47:04] Villenthessis: Hmm Sani then Vault Runs...
[3:47:06] FRAlex010: you guys need to make business bank account
[3:47:07] Xian_TV: @guzeriz i guess the rep for unlocks
[3:47:10] TotDigital: not true at all money is more important then materials, materials are so cheap
[3:47:11] khanoute: Raia is a real one, joining the sani grind with Vee
[3:47:11] ANTiN0VA: raia a real one
[3:47:12] SpecialAgentSkye: NotLikeThis Brie gonna officially lose it by going back to sani. Its jover o7
[3:47:14] ProjectPain1: <3
[3:47:15] AgadhiTheGreat: The question you should be asking is "Who's gonna pay me?" that's what it boils down to
[3:47:17] Roro_____: the problem is, the ones doing g6 spend the money on themselves, and she doing sani is expected to give everything to the house
[3:47:18] w0josh0w: Why doesn't he use the huge amount of money he has earned from everyone work towards this? Am I being weird to think that?
[3:47:22] RavagedPistol: if there was a separate account for the group money than this wont be a issue but he buys a 100k car for himself
[3:47:22] Linds_Brohan: @Liink93 Crime got a buff, it's a bigger target now
[3:47:24] raizzel_azzer: you should ask for money then
[3:47:24] toefi007: clay alex and jason are already 3 for g6
[3:47:24] ProjectPain1: RAIA! <3
[3:47:25] VaeelL: Sure Nick
[3:47:25] bootssncatss: yooooooour money tho hasL
[3:47:26] momzzyy: @guzeriz same its wild that they are discussing this LUL but it is what it is
[3:47:28] glorfindel1111: Sure
[3:47:29] ag_ko: just tell them you need an allowance for sani lol
[3:47:30] Saburbss: add sani people to the group
[3:47:31] NeverOr3: Ask Jason for 50% of his G6 run so that you can grind sandi
[3:47:32] TotDigital: Sure
[3:47:33] auxfrog: i mean vault runs only thing Raia doing anyway lol would make sense
[3:47:35] botdro1d: monkaS Rick Grind
[3:47:35] girlballor: you need to recruit bew people who work sani to the group
[3:47:35] ashleyferns: Sure
[3:47:37] ironbullman: Ya raia gets bored in 2 sani runs LUL
[3:47:38] icecreamnuke: sure
[3:47:43] j_pandy: except now Jason only wakes up to do Vault runs...
[3:47:44] FRAlex010: Acie Do G6 as a group. All pitch in, buy the mats. Otherwise you alone pull for the whole group, it’s just neither efficient nor fair. Spam those Tier 3 truck runs once you have 4.
[3:47:44] jbt445: boys do g6 girls do sani
[3:47:47] Sivvii_: SAJ nunu
[3:47:50] Nightwielder1: girls 4 sani

[3:47:57] vazeline__: Nunu just worried about herself making money
[3:47:57] kais_98: yes yes yes!!!!

[3:48:11] Villenthessis: Boys doing G6, Girls doing Sani Hmm
[3:48:12] FRAlex010: nunu will quit 100 procent
[3:48:17] DreamsPeek: But maybe it's worth it to Simply compensate the Scout for going all the way out to sanitation
[3:48:17] Freppuchino: make him pay you AAAA
[3:48:19] TotDigital: but they are not on
[3:48:20] j_pandy: not if they aren't around

[3:48:34] evkay: Nunu should have stayed awake LOL
[3:48:34] jas3y: nunu and raia do 1 sani run and hdmi kicks in
[3:48:36] ashleyferns: It would look cool
[3:48:36] Xian_TV: @guzeriz yeah but i just think it's intentional mechanics to have G6 making all the money and then all the other jobs give valuable unlocks. all of this could be solved if they just pay her for the materials
[3:48:37] LookItzJoe: But u guys lose rep.... guys just give half the money to the girls and the guys do it with each other

[3:49:06] BorealisLumina: @mavericks312 no, clayton paid her back

[3:49:45] guzeriz: why would any one do sani when mats are 4$ per one explain to me, when g6 is 3x cash thats litteraly 3x faster getting mats then doing sani @Acie omE

[3:52:36] Dumi90: u guys spending all this money on cars is stupid
[3:52:37] DreamsPeek: Well one relevant factor is money because it applies to multiple things, it applies to getting things that make your time more enjoyable like a car it applies to using your time differently by getting materials and it applies because putting in materials and not getting anything back costs time and money
[3:52:39] suspectmids: @andrefvm dont even bother
[3:52:40] theace8869: @guzeriz Sani iS MIND NUMBING work

[3:53:56] Romeo33: PepeLaugh
