[1:13:09] Fossabot: the PMBU, or the professional make believe union is union consisting of GTA RP streamers under 1000 viewers. The union dictates that streamers over 1000 viewers shall shout out the smaller roleplayer 5 times, as well as gift 100 subs to the streamer in order for them to be interacted with. Lastly, they will need to raid you at the end of stream.This applies to ever time that the smaller streamer is interacted with. Contact @KristoferYee to join the union.
