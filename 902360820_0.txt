[5:52:47] DSrlaagyoenr: Tobii said you were missing something So I do think its an item
[5:52:48] DrZombieGamer: id bet it is just a time thing at either a fruit stand or the place in Grapeseed
[5:52:49] NukesJ: i really feel like its tied to a job or something even tho its not listed as a job itself.
