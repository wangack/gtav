[2:06:30] Diaz10gtg: @SoHi_ if they dont progress they depend on the company and cant do anything on their own xdd
[2:06:32] SkarredBlue: they dont see it because they didnt finish the dongles so it is maybe good they finish their rainbow
[2:06:35] Hypo_: why is bro doing cghopping in 2023
[2:06:36] peeeeeeeeeejj: So you can hit it both and from both PC.
[2:06:40] dango226: @Ray__C see what new heist does then let them progress
[2:06:49] unknown___000___: they should progress also, its a nice backup to have...no? also, they have fun on their own...
[2:06:52] gateloz: I dont think re progressing all over again is the play. you guys are already partners your progress is their progress
[2:06:59] OZZYTHEBEAR97: lol they can all come in any tier
[2:07:03] hornycoral: Each dongle has its own tiers
[2:07:13] GeneralPearTree: Listening I CAN LIFT YOU UP
[2:07:15] swordinfinity: @gateloz but not all ex BSK is in company
[2:07:15] ParaSocialVieweR1: @gateloz not at all. They get like 1 person on the heist at best.
[2:07:17] jasonflipmode: That car sounded good
[2:07:24] chechlto1: first one tier 2 Dentge what am I hearing, Im so confused Dentge
[2:07:28] Wiidiis: nah tier 3 is an accident I think
[2:07:30] Shadowhaox: comms LUL
[2:07:33] gateloz: @swordinfinity sly's boys the ones putting in the work are in
[2:07:33] KimParktsingLee: tier 3 is more expensive no?
[2:07:35] GustSauros: Tier 3 definetly with a competent hacker
[2:07:36] chef_pudge: please wait
[2:07:37] takeuchi: tier 3 gunna be 100 btc
[2:07:40] fidzeh: no harm done to purchase it anyway though @Ray__C imo
[2:07:40] tiwiie: no you see the clipper ultra t2
[2:07:40] OZZYTHEBEAR97: so you can get the pro in tier 1 tier 2 or tier 3 and its same with the ultra t1 - t2 - t3
[2:07:40] PeterDragon: What is you cant hack it lysO
[2:07:41] ChaddiusD: the ultra says bills instead of tiers on the pro
[2:07:41] SkarredBlue: @Wiidiis no it cycles at random
[2:07:44] Charmeer: It sometimes fillls dumb
[2:07:45] TropicalToucan: wait is best. They decay dont they
[2:07:47] forsenno1twitchstrimer: kit
[2:07:48] Wiidiis: tier 3 is double the price also
[2:07:56] yehlowtv: @KimParktsingLee both 50, tier 3 was 100 butc but idk why they lowered it
[2:07:58] Rasmus645: Maybe do a lower tier as it's cheaper for first job as its not garanteed you finish it? @Ray__C
[2:07:58] fidzeh: @TropicalToucan the decay is very slow for the other USB though
[2:08:05] tiwiie: t1 25 / t2 50 / t3 100 buttc
[2:08:06] tr3yztwitch: L gamer
[2:08:07] xsgem01: @gateloz Don't they deserve it tho? they've put half for gun bp, half for mags bp, sent extra 200butc +gave 3 extra usbs
[2:08:08] gateloz: @ParaSocialVieweR1 that 1 person can use the knowledge they gain and it'll benefit the group.
[2:08:18] NishaNight: do the 250butc job first then decide the rest
[2:08:19] KimParktsingLee: @TropicalToucan the pro version decayed very slowly like a few %/day
[2:08:20] dango226: @Ray__C sould do the new heist today the you can make a plan
[2:08:22] GOTTARIMRAMOS: when is company hitting cash exchange
[2:08:25] nalydogard: sync and Bill I think
[2:08:26] swordinfinity: @gateloz u know that ray OTT and benji are confirm in hesit + mickey want to train new hacker so when the ex BSK can go ?
[2:08:28] forsenno1twitchstrimer: docnotL my sub is over Sadge
[2:08:31] gateloz: @xsgem01 thats why they deserve to be partners. if they did their own thing it would be a waste
[2:08:32] ZK4i: i think that's scuff it says bill 2 but i think its supposed to be tier 2 or sync 2
[2:08:44] Chronage92: @tr3yztwitch L viewer
[2:08:56] peeeeeeeeeejj: @gateloz exBSK helped with the company usbs for the progress, but their pc is not yet upgraded. They just want to be upgraded too so both pc/group can be used for hitting exchanged

[3:06:45] CozyAndStoned: earbuds cause wax buildup
[3:06:48] coopermcarthur: @kimparktsinglee  it all comes down to the cost of materials. If the suppliers make it 10 per, then 3k is fair. Any less for CBs and its becomes a bit expensive.

[3:08:39] Bleepinbloopin: PEEPEES
[3:08:39] GimeDepusiBoss: @intern729 i agree but its a lot to ask someone to buy 9k worth of radios when people had the money and ability to buy their own
[3:08:44] Bleepinbloopin: PEEPEES 󠀀
[3:08:48] i800spanked: ear buds made my ears raw pretty much

[3:09:16] Ninja_23: @intern729 its not stingy, the fund is toxic already. It happened in 3.0. the fact that the business side doesn't pay the fund makes it already toxic.

[3:09:31] jellal_siegrain: @intern729 yep, at some point everyone needs to be paid but right now nobody can afford to with how the economy and progression works, if they stop at 100 BUTC then maybe they can spare some funds for salaries and what not
[3:09:38] PizzaTemplar: bouseA5
[3:09:39] alpasoup1: @p__dragon i know it's backseating , but they can't but Materials right ? so why are they not chopping and letting Dragon who has 300rep or OTT who has 150+ turn the car parts into material
[3:09:44] xsgem01: @intern729 Weed doesn't even pay anything yet its like 1k hour minus expenses

[3:12:22] jellal_siegrain: @intern729 i firmly believe that the devs will put some limitation into BUTC farming, like a limited amount of racks per house, etc or maybe power bill limitations. I dont think they want people to spam BUTC farm endlessly to hit heists daily

[3:51:37] jojo_s93: It's not about him not needing basic, it's the fact that he'll replace them with 6060 and the needs CB, so more money he gets for basic, more CBs he can buy, more 6060 to craft

[4:42:10] McCape7: Its gonna cost like 10,000 buttcoin
[4:42:12] enemys0ng: Imagine hacking into someones panel and taking their floors
[4:42:13] Dnas3: doubt it, I dont think it would be good for the RP would be too much meta gaming
[4:42:14] oppaigasukidesu: local houses maybe

[4:42:30] devito123: local house sounds more possible than player house
[4:42:36] cory_375: Maybe with some crazy difficult hacks to break into storage containers
[4:42:39] 11_cliff: @Yatsok thats what im saying, if he wants to remove the secret room atleast not allow mr k go down anymore KEKW
[4:42:41] DarkZizou: How would u protect that when cg roll with 6 guns on civ gang for example

[4:42:52] mcgs007: raycPog
[4:43:00] McCape7: I hope that the hacking thing doesnt fall off completely
[4:43:06] DjJF_: It would destroy the server so fast, cause it takes too long to reach this level.
[4:43:08] DarkZizou: Already stealing turbos is scummy imo
