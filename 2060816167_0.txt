[0:40:40] Sivvii_: yeah that was WILD
[0:40:40] DreamLantern_: there is a trick with the safe hack, the solution is likely only one rotation away. the hack was only easy characters too (3-4 different ones), but short time to solve it @NoraExplorer

[0:40:44] buffalobeast210: YEP

[0:40:53] pokerguy18: some streamers just don't know there's a quicker way to use the lockpick
[0:40:54] leeter1337: you turned the safe lock always long way tho
[0:40:54] VobleUK: @Rollo_TT why arent you listening to tekken Madge
[0:40:56] Turboz__: To bad missing the free 20k
[0:40:57] larkan111: you have to be just about precise with that safe hack to do it
[0:40:57] MrMingy: you gotta use both clockwise and counterclockwise
[0:40:57] zaidmir: it was almost impossible
[0:40:58] mirreftw: probably wanna hold it down instead of tapping it to move it around
[0:40:58] hard_spidey: u almost made it to last one

[0:41:10] auree75286: W
[0:41:12] grummwasabi: @noraexplorer you need to not spin it all the same direction, you need to go the opposite direction sometimes on the Safe hack

[0:41:43] Djpaesgana: it only turns 1 way?
[0:41:48] 미니마우수: can you hold it to make it faster?

[0:42:06] Fabio10296: both direction and practice you are doing it good
[0:42:06] d91h230em9: you have to hold and turn the right direction, not the long one, I think
[0:42:09] Mackn9ne: yea you just turn it counter clockwise
[0:42:10] kCblol: you got to the last one a couple of times, shouldve just kept trying
[0:42:11] peterx_14: you had low fps, and couldn't turn it fast enough
[0:42:11] 1iwill: Can't you scroll both ways though?
[0:42:12] Tenivir: yeah it does turn slow
[0:42:12] zytwitch: maybe hold the button?
[0:42:13] ikkigaya1998: nora u had to rotate both directions depending on the situation instead of just one
[0:42:13] toph_er: you have to choose the fastest path left or right.

It’s definitely okay to get involved in the rp, but don’t take it too seriously! Please do not send hate to Nora, or anyone involved. Thank you! noraexL
