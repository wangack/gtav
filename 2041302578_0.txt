[1:29:19] Lunar_Lurker: cause you’ll always need mats
[1:29:23] havoc1962: the issue is , everyone else pays their price,
[1:29:25] JLangg: everything is a grind in the city, these guys just dont want to work
[1:29:30] TheMonkSeal: because grinders are looked at as bad rpers and mats is grinding LUL LUL

[1:30:03] Lauren__Beth: when is our next cooking stream?
[1:30:04] Batmooooon: maybe offset repair pricing with something else
[1:30:09] ThreeNPink: @Batmooooon they sayinf that now but when they have to pay 2k+ to get their trucks fixed then they are going to be crying how it cost so much to get a repair
[1:30:19] SClarke1393: I love how the job isn’t worth it to do compared to group 6 and such but yet they’re still doing it.

[1:31:43] killogic916: Arguing cheaper prices to sanitation in return for keeping repair prices down just dosnt make sense to them. Like he said, everyone else benefits for their loss of selling for that.

[1:36:40] almondmilkwithice: I was up til 6am playing palworld KEKW
[1:36:42] Batmooooon: the difference is the profit margins... reducing it by .5 is literally 50% for the union.. raising the price by a few dollars is maybe 10% for vehicle repairs

[1:51:36] storm_5_: storm_5_ subscribed at Tier 3. They've subscribed for 59 months! Let's be honest, most chats are young on average and have more of a relationship with RP characters than with women. So naturally when characters interact with women there's a romantic/sexual connotation implied by viewers.  One reason I like our Seniors chat shotzAyy shotzOG shotzRg shotzT

[2:09:11] almondmilkwithice: they are mad cause they cant do anything KEKW
[2:09:14] sonsofwayne: `
[2:09:25] patch5594: Nintendo didn’t say anything they’re just copystirking people using Pokémon mods in the game
[2:09:29] Chonsee: already claiming copyright of models etc. and are already gearing up for a lawsuit its funny because its unlikely they will win.
[2:09:35] amras1987: the only claim nintendo has is against the mod that turned the pals into pokemon
[2:09:46] ProdigalBrock: Yeah and that wasn't on the original devs
[2:09:51] R3dl1nes: funny thing is some one alrdy made a pokemon mod for palworld  its really funny

[2:10:51] Keeper24: conan is my favorite
[2:10:55] JLangg: not everyone enjoys the pve games

[4:57:12] jers_gaming: Gyatt or gyat is a slang term that is used to express strong excitement, surprise, or admiration. Gyatt is most commonly used as an exclamation in reaction to seeing a large butt (that is, the buttocks) and may be used as a noun to mean a large butt.
[4:57:16] JayPepino: it's both
[4:57:28] Kizzile82: that’s what it means…and it depends on what u think is sexy about the person
