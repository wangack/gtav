[3:13:27] TheTacticalDonut: i have reading comprehension slowness, so my brain is often still processing what i read in the first sentence by the time i'm finishing the paragraph. So those quick thinking from reading. don't work for me
[3:13:30] Dolgovata: They could've implemented the hacking like "Hacknet". It's realistic in the sense that most of what you do is at least inspired by actual hacking, while it's fun.
[3:13:36] Klammath_: @wolfishmuffin30 Streaming takes skill to a degree, at least to be good at it, but one of the things not required to be a successful streamer is "typing"
[3:13:54] Dolgovata: Hacknet is a hacking game on Steam
[3:13:57] Wulphe: I'm excited to see the crazy home deco stuff that people throw together
[3:14:30] NoDeath: Think hacknet would be to complicated for a casual player

[3:18:19] VHD7: It progresses as you connect to new ones. Find/steal emails, steal data files, etc. Or sometimes cripple a machine
[3:18:21] Mordis_: Afro Did something like this in 3.0 but it was never a dev thing for banks.
[3:18:25] mr_delimber: afro had made one
[3:18:37] weir_dough: There's another game like this thats a MUD called hackMUD that's pretty fun too
[3:18:48] I3itches: for the dark web stuff
[3:18:49] Dolgovata: It would at least differentiate people who actually have a knack for "hacking". So the roleplay aspect is not who can do the minigame the fastest. Just a wishful thought :D
[3:19:19] OhhhFee: have we seen Jacob yet in 4.0?
[3:19:32] The_Keenan: @OhhhFee Yes
[3:19:39] danny_t_t: depends on the employees tbh
