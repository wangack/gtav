[0:35:51] laniatx09: Nope
[0:35:52] kissahomie69x: Johson ended his stream directly after his conversation,, he could have made such a good rp ending out of that ;(
[0:35:53] donsson: Tazer mag empty
[0:35:53] marneraiders: Did the Weapon model also change ?
[0:35:54] ramsin50: I mean wasn’t what denzel saw enough to search the vehicle

[0:36:01] akonv3: Free my boi Johnson
[0:36:01] stellarnaut: he didnt lie about it they claimed he left out information
[0:36:02] st9736: wrongful termination lawsuit would be good RP

[0:36:14] sharrkuu: and then wasn't truthful about what happened
[0:36:15] mufc9905: What's the biggest fine Den Zel has given someone?
[0:36:18] Zunnun: Chill chat don't need to hate on another streamer still
[0:36:19] The_YellowMist: Johnson was great, it’s bs
[0:36:19] iam_Syanda: Johnsons crim arc begins
[0:36:20] kissahomie69x: @RebornOffline  oh fuck i missed that then :(
[0:36:25] akonv3: @aaron_bermy lool
[0:36:26] captain_steve_420: omitting the truth is still lying
[0:36:29] slymox: @kissahomie69x He came back on later and Johnson was drunk in the alleys  making diss tracks
[0:36:30] iJerrBear: donut box is full nice
[0:36:31] ImOome: @Osama_binncappin why take ownership of something you dont believe you did?

[0:36:32] Vestfolding: Mammoths are making a comeback. mark my words they’ll be walking soon
[0:36:35] predatorop91: @BigglesVII he didnt lie tho he omitted some details which is lying by omission but the other 2 officers actually lied multiple times
[0:36:36] marneraiders: where you taser cartridges at ?
[0:36:46] macneutron: @ramsin50 Slacks said he had to see him actually do it for them to search the car

[0:37:05] slymox: @kissahomie69x He was goin in!
[0:37:08] stellarnaut: ommiting the truth suggests that he was aware it was a relevant detail, PD dont put every single detail into a report
[0:37:10] Pravolution: For Ruth Kappa
[0:37:14] FilzG: @macneutron yeah, another good fun RP moment ruined. Dude had a glock
[0:37:19] macneutron: @FilzG You can lie by omitting something
[0:37:23] akonv3: The lying thing is about not saying anything, that's not lying
[0:37:26] Mardomus: didn't derola lie and she still an officer
[0:37:30] BigglesVII: @predatorop91 No being honest and sharing the full facts is still seen as lying. Especially when they have reports from others present witht he full dets of what happend.
[0:37:31] The_YellowMist: to twist those dreads
[0:37:37] Zunnun: Does someone wanna dm me the two other officers don't put it here cause it's meta deansoHeart2
[0:37:37] Osama_binncappin: @Osama_binncappin sometimes you gotta bend the knee especially if you see your boss not backing down..
[0:37:39] FilzG: @macneutron he had concussions on every single time
[0:37:41] Oronyx: I really need to see Ruth die to K lol, I want to see the fall out after that
[0:37:44] laniatx09: Other two cops stretched the truth and Johnson omitted somethings
[0:37:47] cbrooks51: Falsifying reports. something every cop on this department has done based on Slacks comments. you omit one thing, then you lied and cant be trusted.. per Slacks
[0:38:02] 95eagles: Derolla gotta be gone too then
[0:38:05] FLCK3R: his story didn't connect with other 2 officers

[0:38:22] laniatx09: It wasnt even a report or incident made

[0:38:31] jessielight: Slacks was going to dap but Ruth pushed termination
[0:38:32] Mr_Stevex: inconsistency in his reports compared to other officers.
[0:38:33] Zunnun: !meta chill chat
[0:38:33] Fossabot: Don't tell Dean information about other characters that he does not know in game. He cannot do things if it is said in chat and he sees it. Sit back and just enjoy the rp.
[0:38:34] bdg_hyu: Shay-shin
[0:38:38] iJerrBear: that was around the same time
[0:38:39] CuBanMumzy: @predatorop91 he did not lie, according to Ruth he came down and complained, she told Slacks.
[0:38:40] Troytd: now kith
[0:38:45] akonv3: Yea
[0:38:48] ramsin50: slacks said denzel seeing k leave was enough to search him so how is the car different

[0:39:02] bosschar95: hello dean
[0:39:07] P0TES: happy friday den
[0:39:10] panchito_pistoles: Slacks wants to be Tom Selleck
[0:39:10] BigglesVII: He just needed to be transparent and own up to it, but he acted like it didnt happen
[0:39:10] TheBroStud: It is your fault Den Zel, you left him in the dust yesterday!
[0:39:11] macneutron: @Huitsi It was going to be DAPs but he lied
[0:39:13] predatorop91: @BigglesVII the other officers said they said stop.. they didnt.. the other officers says they heard them say he hits like a grandma he didnt
[0:39:13] MenacingCapybara: @joefitz88 now that you asked, no he can't KEKW
[0:39:16] captain_steve_420: chat, three captains and all the FTOs gathered together and determined he lied. Quit bitchin
[0:39:19] Gh0stPog: he lied coz he ain't no snitch
[0:39:21] marneraiders: Have you tried the Explorer yet ?
[0:39:22] laniatx09: He didn't know what the other two cops put in a report so his statement didnt match up to theirs

[0:39:29] joewelch29: @Deansocool ssaab gave johnson prio after fireing him too
[0:39:33] akonv3: @the_yellowmist yep, I think she would give DAPs but not discuss termination
[0:39:34] Dromaius_: I was born safe brother

[0:39:46] Baarty: is shiesty next with he’s sloppy paperwork
[0:39:47] Faildude: He kept doubling down saying it was selfdefense
[0:39:47] Zunnun: What's up?
[0:39:48] spicyville: Esfand and saab both said he can make another cop character. I'm sure they would fast track him.
[0:39:56] buckyboy8: just watch someone get stabbed in London! fuck englans
[0:40:01] JimmyNewf: @MDM4ever1986HD  ooy

[0:40:11] akonv3: @spicyville that's kinda lame tho
[0:40:17] FilzG: @macneutron because when he was defending himself, he also had a concussion again because mr k hit him again yesterday. Case closed, they're fucked
[0:40:18] BigglesVII: @predatorop91 Yeah but without any means of disproving it apart from K making a statement there is no reason to not believe what they reported.
[0:40:19] marneraiders: Will you call it actually SWAT ?
[0:40:21] ZormyTV: C O R N W O O D
[0:40:24] macneutron: @iJerrBear The doctors cleared him, and he said he was ok
[0:40:27] Resmade: chat, johnson will win the court case and get his job back, believe
[0:40:30] MDM4ever1986HD: @buckyboy8 sniper

[0:40:46] marneraiders: Might get DAPed for cop stacking soon LUL
[0:40:47] akonv3: Ramee is 100% lock-in
[0:40:48] MDM4ever1986HD: @Resmade I think he will win

[0:42:11] BKBiggy: make sure they request access

[0:43:35] macneutron: @predatorop91 I think slacks watched body cam, so he knows he was lying
[0:43:40] marneraiders: SWAT doing tactical and investigations ?
[0:43:42] FilzG: @macneutron they will talk to doctors again. Yeah you can be cleared because they wont hold you in the hospital for 5 hours just for RP, but bet they'll say he had a concussion

[0:46:44] IItzLoz: @predatorop91 makes no sense to fire him when the other officers in trouble also
[0:46:52] FilzG: Basically Johnson just forgot to mention he took 10 secs to bandage before fighting mr k. He just said in the report "he punched me and i fought back", which isnt lying

[1:20:18] OiAM_Paka: Them PJ's  look new
[1:20:22] nuuskis2: Bermuda fixed?
[1:20:23] riftshadow: @Johnjoy121 Johnson was fired for lying on a report.
[1:20:32] Matosere: yeah idk why johnson was lying makes no sense
[1:20:42] FilzG: @riftshadow debatable
[1:20:44] AnusReaktorMan: His fault
[1:20:55] xsilas43: i dont think he was lying, just forgot some shit and blackwell lied as well KEKW
[1:21:02] Johnjoy121: @riftshadow ouch! He got prio from slacks & was fired by him, hopefully he can return after some time then he was great
[1:21:11] Matosere: he certainly did lie
[1:21:13] smoktrees489: @riftshadow wait did he actually lie? NotLikeThis
[1:21:15] Sonicfear: OOC Johnson Prio Boosted by both Ssaab and Moon, he got a massive wave of support flood his channel, he'll be fine, this is a good thing and let's him doing somehting great RP wise.
[1:21:16] Caeros: he wasn’t lying, he doesn’t remember. which also makes sense in RP too since he was fighting, shot in the head, then bonked again
[1:21:31] smoktrees489: LUL hauwntReal
[1:21:36] IItzLoz: @xsilas43 he doesn’t remember Ic ooc
[1:21:37] dankNbeans: i wonder if Johnson will get to keep his prio now that he's not a cop anymore.  he was genuinely entertaining to watch.
[1:21:38] Matosere: he said he didnt say he was gonna get fired for this and he did and he also lied about saying mr k hits like his grandma
[1:21:43] riftshadow: The reason Slacks gave was lying but it's kinda debatable.
[1:21:45] ThePointGaming: itll be great once the Sheriffs office is up and running
[1:21:45] kb420ps: Johnson got fired because the police backstab each other,  and aren't a brotherhood at all.  The crims have more of a brotherhood.
[1:21:52] xsilas43: @NotLozu, yeah thats what it seemed like
[1:21:56] brant001: brant001 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[1:22:16] IItzLoz: @xsilas43 he said it on stream last night
[1:22:20] Ezi_GG: @Matosere the im gonna be fired for this comment was a hot mic i believe, which is unfortunate
[1:22:22] xsilas43: @Matosere, and blackwell lied about saying stop Shruge
[1:22:23] Caeros: Johnson & K bonding is great RP anyways
[1:22:32] snoopiessnoop: gonna be cool how this plays out, maybe johnson will get revenge on the slacks and the other cop
[1:22:33] smoktrees489: nah whatever happened im on johnsons side bro he got fired for not saying everything to the exact point or smth but in comparison to ruth damnnnnnn LUL
[1:22:35] Matosere: @xsilas43 yeah she did
[1:22:35] Sonicfear: @dankNbeans The Admins litrerally gave a big Prio boost up.

[1:22:42] westnorwoodnobody_bozo: I'm gonna have so much blow tonight bro
[1:22:56] Matosere: @Ezi_GG uh idk what makes you think that he was definitely talking during that tho,

[1:23:32] dankNbeans: @Sonicfear well that's good to hear.  i enjoy his stream.
[1:23:50] BDG_parth28: Z3 is a movement. A philosophy. A fundamental truth. A revolutionary idea. The change the world needs. A prophecy that is coming true. #Z34L  EarthDay
[1:23:59] BDG_parth28: o7

[1:24:30] Sonicfear: @dankNbeans Yea I agree, I know he was upset over this. But ultimately the overwhelming support shown and big Prio bump, this is actually a good thing for him as a streamer.
[1:24:34] Ezi_GG: @Ezi_GG uh he said it last night during the meeting something along the lines of that wasnt meant to be heard or whatnot, insinuating the hot mic i guess, but who knows
[1:24:49] riftshadow: I hope he makes a new cop but keep playing on Johnson as well.

[1:26:30] spicyville: @Sonicfear this. to be getting in fistfights regardless of who started it is not a good look for a cadet
[1:26:38] Caeros: getting “caught lying” for misremembering a comment about his own grandma is a laughably bad justification for firing
[1:26:38] Resmade: he will only get his job back if he wins the court case

[3:54:17] Pichoto: police corruption is wild
[3:54:18] Ismellkevinbacn: Yeah true
[3:54:18] Resmade: well theres double standards in pd with the whole lying thing it seems thats what k was pissed about
[3:54:19] diermo: they said he left shit out of the report but brain injury argument i guess
[3:54:19] ScreenFresh: they were pissed because they will do anything that goes against the captains
[3:54:21] marneraiders: Kill all Highcommand Kappa Kappa Kappa
[3:54:22] Zunnun: @FLCK3R Tuznami
[3:54:23] vDunq: what was falsified on the report
[3:54:24] flensost: nah they cant go back on this besides he did omitt stuff from his statement anyways it's not the same situation
[3:54:25] tellos0: @bpkamenov Saab and Moonmoon helped, in terms of RP
[3:54:28] judgement_12: @Paxipher Mr. K never even mentioned to slacks he was about to jump off a crane their whole convo just became about them
[3:54:31] FLCK3R: @FLCK3R oh

[3:54:40] flash00300: HE DIDNT FALSIFY. HE LEFT OUT A DETAIL HE WASNT ASKED ABOUT. #FREE JOHNSON
[3:54:50] IItzLoz: @ajax99 ooc k says it’s his fault and shouldn’t be fired
[3:54:50] Floo94: bc den is a lil bitch
[3:54:50] FilzG: @Landoram no one falsified shit, he didnt remember a few details, not the same as lying

[3:55:24] gangstarofgamez: I pledge allegiance to the state of georgia under one chicken , one biscuit , one hot pocket and one turkey leg
[3:55:26] getanime: @flash00300 captains don't care they just need a reason
[3:55:28] FilzG: @No_Sneezing expire after 60 days, which is insane
[3:55:31] Killsauce: man lost his cop but got good prio big worth
[3:55:32] Paxipher: @Paxipher Whatchu talkin about Mr. K called CWood and said he was going to have a convo w/ Slacks, and there was a whole 10+ person conversation outside the PD about how it was wrong for Johnson to be fired
[3:55:34] tellos0: @theo313 one
[3:55:35] OfficialTriggerPlays: Once again we are asking for oilers
[3:55:37] Zunnun: @theo313 Think only johnson got fired
[3:55:38] itsRickus: Yeah Slacks was on one yesterday
[3:55:40] xKingWellzx: we need one Blk captain no cap 💯
[3:55:40] flash00300: JOHNSON DIDNT LIE ON REPORTS # FREE JOHNSON
[3:55:43] marneraiders: if Denzel gets fired, 4HEAD will storm the PD since he will be loosing his favorite Chase Partner
[3:55:49] sixteenbackup: I don’t agree with these daps system and firing, does 1000 good things but 3 bad you’re fired
[3:55:50] macneutron: @No_Sneezing For now, you have to wait 60 days, but the Cpts want to introduce classes to reduce DAPs
[3:55:51] getanime: Is duncen a senior???
[3:55:55] Dr_Epica: @Deansocool Does Den Zel know that duncan got DABed?
[3:55:56] No_Sneezing: @FilzG dam thanks
[3:56:00] BahaZero1: DAPs are more dangerous than crims
[3:56:04] tellos0: @getanime no
[3:56:05] lemmytunngainus: The PD needs an HR department where people would play karens
[3:56:07] Paxipher: @Paxipher Happened about 14 hours ago
[3:56:10] raehv: @Zunnun Cornwood and Lenny also got the boot Kappa
[3:56:12] Milo_lul: omE2 current pd is creating the BCSO squad by handing out daps
[3:56:12] fkingjagaloon: during febuary smh
[3:56:14] Johnjoy121: Slacks also has 1 DAP
[3:56:21] marneraiders: DAPs are worse then a Murder charge
[3:56:23] getanime: @tellos0 oh ok
[3:56:29] nizmo_ttn: #freeuptheguys #freeupjohnson #freeupthehomies #theyaintdonunwrong
[3:56:31] benmaui: @Deansocool so did you buy this car? or is it available to all pd?
[3:56:32] Zunnun: @raehv Cornwood is chilling idk about lenny tbh
[3:56:35] DanLGG: Ks statement backs up Johnson’s. K said I attacked him and he defended himself. Calling him a liar was crazy for not giving every single detail of the altercation but you can’t stand on bidness when ur captain is giving a punishment. you accept it and say yes sir I messed up won’t happen again
[3:56:38] No_Sneezing: @macneutron NODDERS
[3:56:39] marneraiders: @johnjoy121 Ruth has also recieved one
[3:56:39] Landoram: The Captains aren't valuing their officers enough IMO. a lot goes into training and policing and then they don't teach just dap
[3:56:50] Jethrq: HOLY ESSAYS CHAT AINTNOWAY
[3:56:58] MDM4ever1986HD: essaying
[3:57:06] cody38544: I feel like teaching academy should drop off a dap point or two to incentivize people to teach new cadets. Right now there is no dropping off of daps
[3:57:09] FilzG: "strict" is a loose term here
[3:57:11] tellos0: love chat with crazy theories
[3:57:18] gangstarofgamez: The worst part about it was is they claim. He should have just arrested him and said the other officers said he escalated the situation. But they didn't do nothing to stop it either
[3:57:27] reichgeist: he didnt get fired for the fight
[3:57:27] Spartoriius: cornwood does crazier stuff
[3:57:32] Resmade: but now theres a mutual combat law isnt there?
[3:57:36] reichgeist: he got fired becayse ghe "lied" on the report
[3:57:40] IItzLoz: The other cops could of stopped it tho
[3:57:41] BKBiggy: Mans ain't have no Dap tho
[3:57:41] macneutron: @DanLGG Slacks gave him a chance to come clean yesterday, it was only going to be a suspension and DAPs
[3:57:41] Kalaava: wait till
[3:57:41] Zunnun: You know you can't after you got one dap away from getting fired LMAOOOOOOOOOO
[3:57:43] iCLUTCH193: Just killing so much fun RP when they fire him. It sucks.
[3:57:43] MoobergMD: they pick and choose who to be strict with and when to be strict that is the problem
[3:57:43] w111iam1: there needs to be a middle ground
[3:57:44] Caeros: it was awesome content/RP
[3:57:44] MDM4ever1986HD: how many daps would you get if you did it?
[3:57:47] SmokeyPumkin: crazy to me its a RP server but ppl that get good RP gets fire CRAZY
[3:57:49] Paxipher: True, but Johnson maybe should have gotten 5+ daps and a 3 day suspension rather than being straight up fired
[3:57:50] Kalaava: wait till little Texas EZ
[3:57:54] BDG_parth28: Den used to do that daily LUL
[3:57:54] Killsauce: mutual combat has to be officiated anyway
[3:57:56] Pee_aRe: i didn't see that clip i was at the tail end of the whole thing
[3:57:57] DanLGG: The fight wasn’t what got him fired. he was getting dapped for that.
[3:57:59] s0stin: sad cuz thats dope RP. cops have scripted rp now
[3:57:59] williamwildcat: mutual combat has to be done in a courtroom
[3:58:01] marneraiders: The whole situation started with a Miss click LUL NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[3:58:04] tbdd0601: you need a judge for mutual combat tho KEKW
[3:58:07] Kalaava: LETSGO
[3:58:07] psylongti: Mutual combat has to happen at the courthouse
[3:58:08] enfranchise_: enfranchise_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! Got a giftie and had to come back, great rp content brotha
[3:58:10] tellos0: @iCLUTCH193 imagine having cops that lie
[3:58:11] j0k3rhub: he was on duty so that was a problem
[3:58:13] MDM4ever1986HD: 2 W's
[3:58:15] Zunnun: We all Waiting for lil texas SAJ
[3:58:16] bpkamenov: The issue I believe is that currently the PD is trying to fix the cops form 3.0 but instead of focusing on RP they are focuing on rules... rules were never reallyu the issue pf 3.0
[3:58:17] getanime: bro remember u and aziz war with bbmc @Deansocool
[3:58:17] docterstrange_: Mutual combat can only done infront of judge approval
[3:58:17] Malding_Beta: deansoBDG
[3:58:19] Landoram: breaching
[3:58:20] flash00300: @gangstarofgamez FACTS. JOHNSON WAS  ATTACKED IN FRONT OF 2 OFFICERS WHO JUST STOOD THERE
[3:58:21] ViilisRR: what if ruths the under sheriff
[3:58:22] Zunnun: W sub
[3:58:23] watsondubbox: what happens when your ops join the SO PepeLaugh
[3:58:26] macneutron: @Paxipher It was supposed to be that, but he doubled down on the lie
[3:58:28] FilzG: @macneutron because he doesnt fucking remember, the dude cried IRL, do you think he'd lie on purpose knowing that?
[3:58:29] Malding_Beta: KEKW
[3:58:30] MexiBrent: @SmokeyPumkin The streamer got prio and can make another cop so they recognize the good rp atleast
[3:58:31] fkingjagaloon: yeah i get real life but this is video game let loose
[3:58:33] lemmytunngainus: @tellos0 you dont have to imagine, just go outside LULW
[3:58:34] hudzzeyfa: fell asleep to the the stream and just woke up, litteraly the best 3 hours sleep in my life
[3:58:35] marneraiders: The sheriffs office will be standing on bidness
[3:58:36] Malding_Beta: w mans
[3:58:37] BDG_parth28: LUL LUL
[3:58:41] mizkifsrecedinghairline: I can't imagine being a cop when the leadership just seems to pick and choose punishments out of a hat.
[3:58:42] Resmade: K did punch first too.. the other officers stood there and did nothing
[3:58:43] Zunnun: watsondubbox then he ain't joining
[3:58:49] Ismellkevinbacn: I'm also kinda new here but I love the rp bro
[3:58:49] quaylewastaken: the bs is that slacks liked to him about mr K reporting him.
[3:58:55] MakiWind: Aziz are you not gonna do any fto
[3:58:56] Sasquatch_0_0: he was only going to get suspended and daps if he had just admitte that he had "lied" by omission, whether intentional or not
[3:58:57] 98noir: @Paxipher that was the plan if he had said the true
[3:58:58] MoobergMD: I mean when the leaders of PD want robots they remove the people that interact
[3:59:00] UncleJinx: I just peeped the shit about Johnson Fuck that RP
[3:59:00] Emeralblade: I want to see Ramee argue the "Dude had 4? head injuries before all these reports were made" Not saying it will win. But it will be fun RP to watch
[3:59:01] ogbangaz: hear me out… it might be pretty cool to have Shiesty get another dap. it’ll add to his character arc, maybe while your “suspended” you can do some undercover investigator work
[3:59:02] theo313: The captains said that he lied in multiple occasions not just with the K situation
[3:59:05] raehv: @MexiBrent Didnt slacks also mention that he could return if he proves he can change?
[3:59:09] alimahmood1309: it was a bit of fun man
[3:59:11] macneutron: @FilzG He should have said he doesn't remember, instead of insisting he wasn't lying
[3:59:14] alimahmood1309: like wth are we doing
[3:59:14] quaylewastaken: none of the other cops did anything
[3:59:16] xsilas43: YEP
[3:59:17] gangstarofgamez: No it should have been the other officers doing They're damn job
[3:59:18] MoobergMD: yeah they want a robot response
[3:59:26] IItzLoz: He tried to arrest but was told to leave
[3:59:27] Juhoze: It was just someSBS at the end of the day. Sucks it got taken too far. Even K was bummed about it
[3:59:27] quaylewastaken: none of the other cops did anything and reported him
[3:59:28] Caeros: It was a misclick punch and he made it more fun and actual RP
[3:59:29] Paxipher: @Paxipher Very true, and that's on Johnson. But for the punishment to be dismissal is absurd. Should have told Johnson to come back in 1-3 days and cool down and talk about it again with a clear head.
[3:59:31] skylight04: yeah but seaching a but gsr negative its ok
[3:59:35] MDM4ever1986HD: just imagine doing this irl? no cops would hold till he's beating his fellow officers
[3:59:35] watsondubbox: Zunnun I'm hoping for the best for sure, content would be too good
[3:59:35] SmokeyPumkin: @MexiBrent oog i miss that and thats good
[3:59:36] Resmade: understandable but its also just a bit of sbs like damn have fun
[3:59:36] LiQuiD_HoTshoTYT: yo yo dean#
[3:59:37] LordKain73: Slacks in contemp of court= no a problem.  Johnson not remembering = instant firing.
[3:59:38] FatGirlDrunk: Funny part is Mr K deskpopped the  acciental hit and just ran with it.
[3:59:39] dubbini: wait but remember when you got hit by that guy and retaliated with a baton

[3:59:48] MDM4ever1986HD: OH DAMN
[3:59:49] Kalaava: BOOBA
[3:59:51] tellos0: @quaylewastaken again, not true
[3:59:53] marneraiders: that sheriffs office will enforce FAFO till kingdom come. They will be riding around with Lever action rifles. Public executions and that shit
[3:59:53] josebib: ya but you could say it was self defense @Deansocool
[3:59:54] AsuniRS: fake lovemore Stare

[4:02:05] macneutron: To be fair the situation was a blessing in disguise for Johnson

[4:03:09] raehv: @CheeseMongerJet Bruh, that got me, felt for the man real bad
[4:03:18] flash00300: @macneutron Yeah true. Lying and leaving out a detail in where he was attacked is 2 different things.

[4:45:11] Caeros: @Athasin he explicitly says he doesn't want to know about certain things. It doesn't even have to be relevant, don't spoil it for the player
[4:45:15] FilzG: why didnt he chase in the Taurus? Im confused
[4:45:15] Speshulist: @AbsolutionSR mayor has no real authority. he can call superiors and if your superior tells you to, then you are good
[4:45:30] Resmade: he was told specifically not to be primary if its a seminal or something
[4:45:34] BadRabbits: @FilzG already had 4 cars on chase
[4:45:35] fraze_420: @RomanNumera thats the problem IMO there should be no trouble at all for it and by trouble i mean chat and viewers

[4:45:41] loliplol: yo Dean and chat <3
[4:45:46] ClutchMoses: @Speshulist Mayor has the ability to pardon
