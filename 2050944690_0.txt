[4:07:40] StreamElements: On December 3rd, 2023, curvye was about to delete curvyeQuack , thinking it was a mere Halloween emote. He was thankfully stopped by members of the community who shall remain nameless for their safety. curvyeQuack is chat's #1 favorite emote, voted 4 years in a row. Curvye still has to apologize for his crimes against chat #quackgate
