[1:48:40] therealmiikkss: @kodiene97 Gifting subs is you giving someone a sub
[1:48:43] JodyyHighroller: lol Û†ÄÄ
[1:49:00] holedownsir: lol
[1:49:04] mastershredder: and subbing yourself gives you access to andys emotes and no ads
[1:49:17] kodiene97: ooohhhhh ok I gotcha
[1:49:27] chrisjc77: @kodiene97 both support the stream but one is so you can uninterrupted access (no ads) also emote access and if the broadcaster switches to sub only mode, you can still chat... gifted does the same thing but just goes to other users who don't have subs
