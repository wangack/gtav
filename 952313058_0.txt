[6:02:49] masChinee: make it always 50/50, easy does not matter on the purity
[6:02:52] Crit_c: @toastandbutter there not basing it on 400, cause speedy knows he can get about $560 per bag
[6:02:54] aksel______: @jpops1 cuz speedy could just walk away aswell lmao
[6:03:00] Kyndagh: @CaptnCrafty Cook is a lot less likely to get caught than those selling on the street
[6:03:05] Xx_InSomNia_xX: why not sell speedy the batch for whatever price then just let him sell for whatever he wants?
[6:03:07] juannari7: uhnSuffer My internet came back what's going on?

[6:03:27] Friedrich_WilhelmIII: @juannari7 comcast? uhnSuffer
[6:03:28] kutuajaib: 50/50 is better, imagine if the purity is higher and the rep is ceiling. you gain alot more
[6:03:29] toastandbutter: @Crit_c Siz would sell it to Speedy for $400 flat. So Speedy would be making half plus whatever he would make pushing it
[6:03:33] Tacoria1: how did saab just figure that out

[6:05:09] massive_legend420: LUL
[6:05:10] Crit_c: @toastandbutter they did away with that figure though, cause 1) it's too complicated especially when you get changing purities and 2) that was putting the Vagos at only 25% of the profit when he has to split among 10 people.
[6:05:11] NoManners: NODDERS speedy
[6:05:14] fractalmoe: that sounds like a you problem speedy

[6:05:34] TheGaffer88: hes right, speedy fronts the 12k for the cook then splits the profit
[6:05:34] dsiOne: its 15% for everyone so it cancels out DESKCHAN
[6:05:35] dreamwalker213: I personally think cooks should get more than the street sellers. They put in the most work and time to get the best product. But that’s just me

[6:06:04] Actual_Nicotine: @bmackin213 it takes a lot longer to move a batch on the street than it does to cook it
[6:06:06] BextheBoo388: @wololojuice your name disturbs me
[6:06:07] Kyndagh: He's getting taxed on a larger number
[6:06:11] raydryak: (Gross income - 12k buy in)/2
[6:06:17] Taze_555: @TeeaHeCee his boys will be selling too

[6:06:19] cubshy: taxes are a biatch
[6:06:38] dreamwalker213: @actual_nicotine you still have to put into account the 1-2 months siz and saab spent trying to perfect the batch
[6:06:41] bluunova_: tax rp is too real uhnSuffer
[6:06:41] irishnelly1: If you cook every other day thats 21k a week each, thats not bad
