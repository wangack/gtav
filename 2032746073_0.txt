[3:27:58] VicOnTop: if they werent detained they can walk away though
[3:27:59] kroknows101: for running a red light...
[3:28:00] ProtectYaNeck23: waffling
[3:28:01] qats: he only saw a red light violation
[3:28:03] KingDekar: thats a big reach from a traffic stop

[3:28:11] galipeau12323: Reaching a bit
[3:28:15] Teddsan: should just detain everyone in the area and search them too
[3:28:15] octagonner: @Peeeelz he literally didn't get searched even tho he messed with the inventory of his car so the answer is no
[3:28:16] perox89: red light? KEKW must be drugs

[3:28:18] jedimindtricks82k: harrSuffer .o O ( ♻️ harrSuffer 🍔 ))
[3:28:21] lora1969: just a traffic stop

[3:28:22] MendokuShea: cleetus thinks if he "knows" they're guilty that's enough
[3:28:23] splashhbroth3rr: I guess you can search Harry for every traffic stop bc of his book
[3:28:24] mochalex: DansGame
[3:28:26] magnets_: what does a stabbing sound like in game? @Ssaab
[3:28:26] WhyCanTiHasSpaces: i guess he's implying extra caution cuz its harry and a prior incident?
[3:28:35] mullybags: hes just assuming and wanted a reason to search the truck
[3:28:38] n_x_l_l: @DrSwole The question is moreso how does a traffic violation extend to suspicion of drugs/weapons/etc
[3:28:40] ArenaKrusher: yeah but it is very suspious if Harry reached into the back after he was told it was being impounded
[3:28:40] WhyCanTiHasSpaces: i agree
[3:28:41] slomojosh: the suspension begins when he orders them to go to the sidewalk and they start taking stuff out of the dumpster
[3:28:41] a_ou1: @MendokuShea exactly
[3:28:45] zandrusz: Red light violation and they are just picking up garbage. Idk might be reaching a bit LUL

[6:32:27] emery_steele: 1 charge per victim makes sense
[6:32:31] Drkdream: not stacking if they attack different people no?
[6:32:35] TexelHex: its 3 charges
[6:32:47] magnets_: AOE master
[6:32:50] Kevz95: if he killed 3, it'd be three counts of murders. would it be different if its just assault?
[6:33:05] Kevz95: RIPBOZO
[6:33:10] Thebreadlord: I always thought it was multiple charges, but I don’t know
[6:33:20] BackWoodBilly111: what would the charge be if it was 3 cops that got hit 3 separate or just 1 ?
[6:33:23] Drkdream: it should be 3
[6:33:24] Four_AM_Water_Chug: It'd definitely be 3
[6:33:28] DCSeth: 1 murder and 2 counts of manslaughter?
[6:33:28] Chaoszero_goc: 3
[6:33:28] thiefoftheday: it would be 3
[6:33:33] emery_steele: D:

[6:33:44] Thebreadlord: LUL
[6:33:49] unred31: We all know it
[6:33:51] Kevz95: @DCSeth actually this is probably accurate. since he intended to assault one.
[6:33:56] brushun: 3 counts. if you open fire into a crowd and kill a bunch of people it’s a separate murder charge for each person
[6:34:00] Speeddevilx: he jaywalked
[6:34:22] Artsii1994: What are you eating

[6:34:33] AquaAdventures: RIPBOZO
[6:34:34] DCSeth: the murder charge depends on intent tho right?
[6:34:35] Nymsoft: If he killed 3 people, it would be 3 victims, and 3 charges of murder

[6:39:31] RobotsAndMaltLiquor: in this case the disobeying is not related to the resisting, but usually they are disobeying as part of being arrested

[6:40:13] RevansMask: Has cornwood even talked to him?

[9:07:01] meeto_tv: if he wanted to run he could have easily cleared up the felony, i think squeex didnt want ramasquamy to run in the end when he found out its actually work.
[9:07:09] scootypebbles: He thinks it would be alot of work to be mayor
[9:07:12] spacecat204: yeah it would've been funny to see him resign DAY ONE
[9:07:26] scootypebbles: and Dab would be a better fit cuz hes been around for awhile
[9:07:38] Drkdream: @rclemon_ look at that tackle from a different angle, just posted that on discord

[10:40:51] CBS_Kong: a brick is 100g, not a felony
[10:40:51] Teq702: one bag always seems to be 0.5kg, think it has more to do with the inventory weight system than being properly representitive of the weed

[11:35:40] danmac: I like to think Cornwood is
[11:35:43] Krimson07_: as longs as the person planting the weed leaves breadcrumbs for the house owner to go off of i fine with it

[11:35:54] vedysuace: why would K leave that outside lol
[11:35:56] TraviiiOnTwitch: youd have to prove mr k was aware of it and didnt report it
[11:35:58] wazo___: doesn't help the case that the tipster refused to id themselves
[11:35:58] TTLcute: he also purposefully bought houses on grove to shit stir. lol.

[11:36:01] King_Rexy: @panos_97 no he doesn't OMEGALAUGHING

[11:36:04] wilson060: does PD have a raid vehicle currently?
[11:36:06] theppac: @Its_BitZ chodie right?
[11:36:07] sspungg: if I can just plant weed in somones yard an get them raited is crazy

[11:36:27] homiebear17: i dont know whos it is but im sure mr k wont leave that out there
[11:36:29] CowsAndStuff: outside is hard to prove who's it is because anyone has access. Inside not everyone has access to so easier to prove
[11:36:32] Scoobyk: Can you lockdown houses in 4.0?

[11:36:43] arsenalfan10101: No offline raids...
[11:36:43] realsyphix: idk if its scuff or not, planted or not, but if hes trying to get cops to move in right around his house, it would be strange for him to have that sitting outside
[11:36:43] yooyoorp: I'm not going to DM anyone. I'm not going to META.
[11:36:45] deathdarkstar: Property should be defined in two parts inside and outside, outside is very dicey
[11:36:49] surelyURjokingMrFeynman: can you post a notice? will that get wiped on tsunami?
[11:36:50] baliyy: thats gona be abused

[11:37:03] TastyKudzu: There's no way this can lead to a raid. Otherwise PD gonna be conducting 20 raids a day for frame jobs.
[11:37:06] ES_Avilon: You wait until they get online then approach them saying that you are going to get a "warrant" to investigate and then you can go from there. If they are not online its the time it takes to get a warrent.
[11:37:08] surelyURjokingMrFeynman: cops need to be able to nail something to the door saying it was raided or searched
[11:37:08] ryuudrg: maybe if only pd have photos of the person getting the ilegal things without reporting

[12:12:46] Linelux: fuck it
[12:12:50] Serakkis: @100rc I think the item placed looked like a generic bag but was a book

[12:12:53] leinhart31: buddhaWW

[12:13:01] sykalele: do it we wont snitch
[12:13:09] yanni4100: A real police officer would immediately open the book and then lie about it afterwards
[12:13:18] hippieh8rlol: The weird thing is it wasn't even hidden. There were so many places to hide it from view
[12:13:23] DESHAWNTE: @yanni4100 true lol
[12:13:27] venomag_: they were inside
[12:13:31] Xethra: just seems weird with the flooring and stairs clipping through the wall and the notebook being placed on that surface
[12:13:32] rajokhan: has Leo been inside the house before invited by K
[12:13:35] etherealdream: pretty sure that guy never met Mr K either, Saususge
[12:13:43] FowlBirdman: hello officer i found many bricks of neatly organized marijuanas outside, as one does
[12:13:45] Nymsoft: Book's are not protected, it was left in the open, it's not sealed like a phone, and your search of the book for hidden weapons/drugs can be articulated @Ssaab
[12:13:50] sspungg: I mean u took the weed id look at it if it’s not ment to be just don’t use it cuz ya giving it back anyway
[12:13:58] coolkidzombie: note book definitely looks scuffed

[12:14:00] iRawrTwice: 3 bags 1.5k Kappa
[12:14:02] 100rc: @Serakkis whoever made the 911 specifically mentioned the book probably to draw attention to it
[12:14:08] Dalm4s: Yes ICANT
[12:14:09] Chaos_91: yeah its 1000g to 1kg
[12:14:14] wazo___: the weights are definiltey scuffed if those 3 bags were 1.5kg
[12:14:17] titanvol29: And why would K or any of CG leave something like that outside
[12:14:19] R3dl1nes: it so looks like a setup
[12:14:26] TumNarDok: kilo means 1000 all you need to know

[12:15:06] Eddie1225: KKona
[12:15:13] Serakkis: @Serakkis mm it's difficult if a bag is a placeholder, could be a plant or he looked himself and it's genuine
[12:15:16] Artsii1994: America KKona
[12:15:28] Uses_Profanity: These are undried plants. so the mass/size ratio would be less than densely packed, dried, and packaged stuff
[12:15:38] shanejo127: This probably isn't enough to charge or anything right?  Just investigate further.
[12:15:40] hippieh8rlol: Has 3 houses... Hides illegal stuff in plain view from street... Fishy lol

[12:16:23] bigbadwu: LUL can you check who worked sani ?
[12:16:25] kiolkjm: pedro guy did say that he trespassed to find them so there is grounds to bring him in for questioning

[12:16:48] etherealdream: sus sure
[12:16:49] yanni4100: watch it slowly becoming less
[12:16:55] Jurgen___: imagine if this ends with only a trespassing charge for the snitch LULW
[12:16:56] HeyMeghan: @b0b3r7 if you’re on the property and open the housing app it tells you the address where you are.
[12:16:59] lookingfornothinghere: You should place the bricks on a table and pose with them like they do IRL for the news @ssaab
[12:17:00] nomad_hk: he can count it prioabbly better at math than the pd ;0
[12:17:01] TumNarDok: trash workers go on property to pick up stuff right
[12:17:02] kiolkjm: so tampered with evidence
[12:17:07] brook_cs2: i guess we saw 3 rows of 10 or something
[12:17:10] yanni4100: "We're happy to report that we have found 28 bricks of weed on the premises"
[12:17:11] Ludw1G: good will hunting but he's a sanitation worker KEKW
[12:17:19] nomad_hk: yeah get the news guys in
