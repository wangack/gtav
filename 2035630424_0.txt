[5:54:12] wolfemeister: i did one recently -- the food was good, but i got food poisoning
[5:54:15] watermelon3001: YEP
[5:54:18] sBuon: I had someone suggest I had to try watching Lt Custard, I've regretted it since NODDERS
[5:54:20] Geralt_De_Rivia: and then you have to lie and say "oh yeah it was good"
[5:54:30] j0rilla: BUT that is due to i am a fucking chef and ..sorry cook... but yea i cant
[5:54:36] Gobukiller: Mmmm... that medium rare chicken
[5:54:39] Caleb_Kirk: If someone ever tells me that, my first question is "were you drunk and/or hungover when you ate there?"
[5:54:45] VSDuck: but was the chicken good?
[5:54:59] j0rilla: WTF
[5:55:03] wolfemeister: NOTHING. is worth food poisoning
[5:55:09] cal5903: medium rare chicken sounds sickening
[5:55:12] Geralt_De_Rivia: Food poisoning ruined tacos for a year for me
[5:55:14] watermelon3001: I've had rare pork, all good OK
[5:55:20] j0rilla: the really to under cook chicken ???
[5:55:23] j0rilla: they?
[5:55:29] InnocentXray: Except trips to Mars
[5:56:07] Geralt_De_Rivia: how bout mountain oysters?

[5:56:30] I3eCynical: hes like a dog
[5:56:37] JediJacob_: what was that cornwood tweet?
[5:56:44] j0rilla: wait THATS a fucking thing >??????? and the wonder why the started the rice act .............
[5:56:45] Gobukiller: The thing is, you cook steak rare for texture... cooked chicken is already the right texture if you've done it right, so why risk it?
[5:56:46] ThomasTheDestroyer: Probably also how they raise them. Most factory-farmed chicken basically is allowed to live in and eat its own shit.
[5:56:50] j0rilla: they soorty
[5:56:52] kaleidoskopeyes: the whole texture situation at the thought of raw chicken though NOPERS
[5:56:58] j0rilla: i cant type i give up to drunk for this shit
[5:57:09] gingerchris86: I will try most things, even ingredientsI know I don't like, but draw the line at things that make me cringe, like chicken feet, tiger penis soup, that sort of thing
[5:57:12] Zorfianna: would you try pufferfish though?
[5:57:26] Geralt_De_Rivia: @j0rilla its wednsday bruv
[5:57:31] Tabah: Pufferfish is really really good
[5:57:32] ThomasTheDestroyer: And yeah, a nice med-rare to med thick cut bone-in pork chop is the bee's knees.
[5:57:46] sBuon: AAAA
[5:57:46] Nightbot: AAAA
[5:57:47] Tabah: Expensive, but worth it in my opinion
[5:57:48] Zorfianna: @gingerchris86 tiger what now? HUHH
[5:57:49] SharkyShocker: AAAA
[5:58:04] random_viewer_55: You must make a statue to Psaghettio some day btw
[5:58:10] clownfnuu: love pork chops
[5:58:15] sBuon: idk if I've ever tried a porkchop
[5:58:20] j0rilla: @Geralt_De_Rivia yea well servers sucked ass today sooo shots and beers to end it off good
[5:58:21] B__M__C: I would rather risk food poisoning than eat an overcooked pork chop agian

[5:58:44] Geralt_De_Rivia: fuck that
[5:58:45] ThomasTheDestroyer: Trichinosis hasn't been a real issue in NA in almost 30 years, which is why they used to insist on cooking the shit out of pork
[5:58:45] WarpIRL: I prefer Beef over pork
[5:58:45] watermelon3001: AAAA
[5:58:47] LockNLoadJesus: i just dont eat pork lol
[5:58:50] Tabah: Oh man my mom used to make the best breaded pork chops in the world (Bold statement I know, but she was the best cook I've ever had hands down)
[5:58:56] Zorfianna: yeah I found out at 25 that I do in fact like steak, and my mom just literally nuked them. my mom cooks steaks for legit 15 minutes each side CollinSuffer
[5:58:56] Lypilia: my mother had a specific little black pan that she cooked her porkchops in and they were the most dry little fuckers ever
[5:58:57] sBuon: Bro blame my mom bro. She never let me try new shit at restaurants growing up
[5:58:57] Caleb_Kirk: some of the best pork chops I've had were the next day when I made some leftover sandwiches
[5:59:09] Gobukiller: I hated pork chops as a kid, but I don't know if I still wood. My dad is an excellent cook, but it's possible he overcooked it
[5:59:18] Gobukiller: *would
[5:59:18] ZealousCrow: Your mouth gets so dry just trying to chew an overcooked pork chop

[5:59:35] Tabah: I can't re-create it to save my life
[5:59:43] I3eCynical: as soon as my mom got a griddle, she instantly never overcooked pork chops again...i miss them now lol
[5:59:58] I3eCynical: (not the overcooked)
[5:59:58] WarpIRL: Beef is the best
[6:00:05] ZealousCrow: Beef depends on the cut.

[6:00:21] ZealousCrow: There's tons of great pork dishes. Lamb and goat too.
[6:00:28] ThomasTheDestroyer: I love bacon. I also will take well-prepared pork belly over pork every hour of every day\
[6:00:29] Caleb_Kirk: bacon over a nice burger? nah never
