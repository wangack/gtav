[0:34:19] SVrider: no he restrained himself on the cops
[0:34:21] og_duhmetreE: all of this for a reckless evading LUL
[0:34:21] Dustbug: I mean if the overall message gets across it might be worth it
[0:34:28] shermz4: you could eventually pay for expungement

[0:34:30] facelessXfactor: If you view it not being worth it. Is it worth staying on this server knowing PD won't Change
[0:34:34] jaggedbowl420: it‚Äôs a 2 way street. K never ooc that he was scuffed so if he never says anything how is it supposed to be fixed?

[0:35:11] A_Mad_Boar: They 10-CG'd over something minor like that
[0:35:11] xtopspotx: k rped the scuff

[0:35:25] tophersitos: of last week
[0:35:28] jaggedbowl420: they ALWAYS extend the warrants for K tho
[0:35:30] tophersitos: or Sunday
[0:35:31] joseph24c: Yeah no clue on that one
[0:35:32] shoreeee: 9 cops on a nothing warrant.. wtf
[0:35:33] MrCythe: it was funny because at the courthouse slacks was trying to tell K what the warrant was for & to turn himself in LUL
[0:35:33] shermz4: ya‚Äôll played out the scuff
[0:35:34] David_usgames: KEKW
[0:35:35] Its_ray: they extended it more than once I think
[0:35:36] DoggerTaffy: he got it the saturday before
[0:35:40] b_goodhue: Wanted to take his tracker off
[0:35:42] anthonytanza001: Yeah, Tuggz asked the same
[0:35:45] msdeell: yep
[0:35:46] iAuD1O: slacks tried talking to K about the warrant but he didnt want to hear it LUL
[0:35:46] crystalkat20: But the cops act like K murdered the President or something
[0:35:47] kevol33t: That's the worst place to do it hahaga
[0:35:48] BinkyLea: apparently Ramee was told what the warrant was for but forgot.
[0:35:49] grautrr: yeah they had so many units at the court tho, excessive given the warrant charge
[0:35:49] DoggerTaffy: it had been 6 days

[0:36:08] OGxTHCa: that‚Äôs why k the leader
[0:36:09] monacoforever: and tgats it
[0:36:11] RaptorQuiz: Can't fix stupid
[0:36:14] Dustbug: they would have never done a 1 for 1 trade though
[0:36:16] Ohgeezy3easyfreezy: you know how ramee is lol
[0:36:16] weyland_yutani_x: yeah doing stuff at MRPD is a bad move the PoPo get heated LOL

[0:36:19] tophersitos: it was like 6 days cuz k got that warrant last weekend
[0:36:20] rigoristorphan: he wanted one cop per person to escape
[0:36:20] b_goodhue: Don't worry K has a surprise on Monday when he finds something out
[0:36:22] Naked_Yeti: rameethinking‚Ä¶lol
[0:36:27] SVrider: Oh, this is me Rameeon
[0:36:28] brosean78: Rule 1
[0:36:28] Jayl0cked: ramee was worried they'd do like they did to others and just shoot them he saw the two cops sitting there and though maybe he could use all 3 for negotiations but as we know dogshit cops never honor them,
[0:36:30] monacoforever: shoulda just shot him n dipped
[0:36:30] anthonytanza001: You also had Ramee driving yet again
[0:36:33] Maverick2813: you take him out of town say you only want one cop for the exchange and if any others so up you kill him
[0:36:37] cannucky: they were extending it until court no matter what
[0:36:37] joseph24c: He had stacks though 100% would of done a 1 for 1
[0:36:48] ThreeNPink: @RaptorQuiz come on bro
[0:36:48] ericpolle: Lol...if your friend jumps of a cliff....
[0:36:49] hopalong92: If you took him to the spot it would of been better
[0:36:50] caseymfingjones83: Reckless evading with hut charge response
[0:36:52] anthonytanza001: Rule 1 needs to start getting followed
[0:36:54] iamlib33: ramee gonna beat it on appeal if you ask him
[0:36:54] highspeedpi: New rule, never leave witness, kill all cops lol

[0:37:17] BinkyLea: Ramee doesn‚Äôt have the emotional intelligence to be the leader in times like that
[0:37:22] soulsurvivor6: Rule #1
[0:37:24] Jayl0cked: true...
[0:37:28] DoggerTaffy: it wouldnt have worked
[0:37:31] Xairuz: i think even zolo said that too in the radio
[0:37:37] ThreeNPink: @soulsurvivor6 ramee is not shotz og it is the other way around
[0:37:41] DoggerTaffy: still would have shot
[0:37:42] b_goodhue: Tuggz yesterday told ramee u acting like a Bi*** during group6 situation lol
[0:37:46] 27quetzii: they wouldn't take you for K
[0:37:49] anthonytanza001: @soulsurvivor6 Rule 1 should be changed to "Never Follow Rule 1" because they never do.
[0:37:49] Xairuz: Zolo wanted to take the fall for the gun and hostage
[0:37:50] facelessXfactor: Facts like Pnut did the 1st time for K to get the warrant
[0:37:54] UnchartedCF: well ramee is cooking up something that might actually work in his favor LUL
[0:37:55] joseph24c: What ??
[0:37:57] DeadAssCuh: HUH

[0:38:35] Naked_Yeti: Ramee trying to out do peanuts save‚Ä¶‚Ä¶lol
[0:38:35] birdie409: oh man the stream title lol
[0:38:44] anthonytanza001: @brosean78 they never follow rule 1
[0:38:44] b_goodhue: @unchartedcf yes he is but probably still find a way to mess it up lo
[0:38:51] steffan_cbs: jep
[0:38:54] Kenderssss: It was awesome tho
[0:38:56] BinkyLea: yeah like peanut did
[0:38:58] ThreeNPink: @zmasheytv they way it is worded is that ramee is shotz og
[0:39:02] UnchartedCF: @b_goodhue true, it's ramee at the end of the day KEKW
[0:39:05] everplayz101: WAS good RP anyway lmao
[0:39:06] BrSaltyGuy: Why would they take you in jail instead of K?
[0:39:06] MisterMattGamer: all this for a reckless evading warrant LUL
[0:39:07] whodoneit8: the cops endangered the public for a non dangerous warrant
[0:39:09] 27quetzii: but why would cops exchange K for vinny?
[0:39:10] daleychuck: one thing for sure that man is ride or die lmao
[0:39:11] steffan_cbs: siobhan  no laywer
[0:39:12] mejustnoone: Its gonna be cool CG has good connects
[0:39:13] grautrr: was Vinny wanted? Why would they exchange
[0:39:13] Lightthelamp23: need the shooters back for hell week
[0:39:15] Slime0Xp: Happened is happens
[0:39:16] whodoneit8: they shouldn'tt have provoked it i feel like
[0:39:18] highspeedpi: The show was pretty sick tho
[0:39:21] BerryGoodAim: Ramee was convinced 3 cops was enough for them to not shoot
[0:39:22] Ohgeezy3easyfreezy: ramee get tunnel vision during those situations shotz lol
[0:39:27] joseph24c: true then they would of had to deal with you on top of it
[0:39:29] smcclain: wait till you hear his next plan lol
[0:39:30] xGimmeThat: In ramees words he blacked out lol
[0:39:31] Takima80: this is where maturity comes in to play... wiser minds know better
[0:39:33] Teh_birdman: they were tackling inside a courthouse, kinda stupid
[0:39:48] Lightthelamp23: when hell week start
[0:39:49] kegelblitzzz: They would have shot anyway 199%
[0:39:50] Tempozz: K should have got away, the scuba tank scuffed, none of that should have happened
[0:39:53] 27quetzii: why would cops exchange K for vinny? am I missing something in the story?
[0:40:00] SVrider: Nah, I gotta give Ramos props. Dropped everything to rescue K. Can't fault him for cops not honoring negotiations.
[0:40:01] Naked_Yeti: that a new good one Rameelogic!
[0:40:03] tophersitos: put it this way he didn‚Äôt care about the lawyer job anymore after the court case. like you can literally prove the cops or anyone in power did their job incorrectly but nothing will happen to them.
[0:40:04] brosean78: In my Ramos voice... not in my voice
[0:40:06] socialistchris: my take is that he doesn't care about losing the lawyer gig and is upset about the way it went down from a story perspective
[0:40:07] gingermickygaming: The annoying thing I'd they didn't obey the demands like they said they would n they wonder why ppl don't trust the pd
[0:40:12] joseph24c: yeah it has always been hit or miss
[0:40:13] 27quetzii: true
[0:40:14] hopalong92: The whole PD for a warrant though is a bit much
[0:40:21] abn_texas: catJAM catJAM catJAM
[0:40:22] Takima80: need scuba rep lol
[0:40:24] anthonytanza001: Ramee's Lawyer arc ended on Ramee's terms. 29-0
[0:40:24] ihugg2: Scuffed the same in 3.0
[0:40:26] havefunuall: its all m icky fault give k scuff stuff lmao
[0:40:26] b_goodhue: It was just funny that mickey gave him the tank lol
[0:40:28] Tempozz: JP didnt have a problem using it, they dove a lot in 4.0
[0:40:29] monacoforever: they were treatin k like he a mob leader
[0:40:30] highspeedpi: JP used one and it worked
[0:40:38] monacoforever: they act like k a mob boss
[0:40:39] AlbyNz: I think Slacks checked one of officers who was gonna shoot Taco for tackling lol
[0:40:39] monacoforever: lmffao
[0:40:39] BinkyLea: too bad it would have been a great getaway
[0:40:39] crystalkat20: Mickey is the one who gave it to him
[0:40:42] LemonWade: I feel like it was because he put it in while in the car
[0:40:48] socialistchris: X said the same thing about tanks
[0:40:54] DeadAssCuh: @highspeedpi he didn't use it in the car he knows the scuff with it
[0:41:00] 27quetzii: it was like 8 cops for an evading charge bruh
[0:41:02] Ohgeezy3easyfreezy: there was like 6 cops inside courthouse & another 3-4 outside lol üòÇ shotz
[0:41:02] Tempozz: Lol yeah
[0:41:04] fartybum: ya but it was the first scuba time in 4.0
[0:41:09] highspeedpi: Oh ok
[0:41:09] hennessywalton9: Ramee took 2 more cops so you didn't have too but cops ignored the deal
[0:41:17] Nitrostealth: Oh shit, the game didn't crash Pog
[0:41:23] LemonWade: @DeadAssCuh Yes he did, he got it from the glovebox while running
[0:41:23] mrgreen941: I feel because his air tank was skuff yall should have got a "free restart" on the chase.
[0:41:25] anthonytanza001: I just don't know how CG is gonna be fighting all these battles against other gangs (like The Company) when they all snitch now.
[0:41:25] fartybum: honestly the entrapment in the court house is so fucked
[0:41:31] Teh_birdman: then slacks claims it was only 4 cops
[0:41:32] monacoforever: k the loss santos mob boss
