[1:25:25] BugzPlays: when i worked at Walmart they told us to have angry people call the 1 800 number and they don't answer
[1:25:26] Jabberwotchi: Thats why you get a refill debit card and put sign ups for gyms of meal kit subscriptions on that. They're always shady to cancel, much easier to close the card
