[2:24:07] slyoperator: OOOO
[2:24:18] PotatoPie25: PauseChamp
[2:24:19] ArcaniWolfTv: What a take.
[2:24:25] Lunar_Delta: WeirdDude
[2:24:27] MegaKarp101: Whippy please no whipSuffer
[2:24:31] itsDaniBear: It's a job - just because it's enjoyable, doesn't devalue it
[2:24:33] TheAngrierAvocado: ok back to cancelling strimmer
[2:24:45] freakinfe3n: o7
[2:24:52] TylaBlue: oh no
[2:24:59] Theawesomeraccoon: here we go LUL
[2:25:04] DOWNBAD_ELLY: here we go KEKW
[2:25:23] gizzmoharding: agreed
[2:25:27] xoduh: TRUE
[2:25:28] jjanieee: agreed
[2:25:29] MeowBez: making the reddit post as he speaks...
[2:25:29] Theawesomeraccoon: tru
[2:25:31] mousereid: 100%
[2:25:32] PotatoPie25: sensible take
[2:25:32] yolfiic: tru
[2:25:34] MeowBez: Kappa
[2:25:34] Gabba0G: based and tru
[2:25:37] TylaBlue: I think its hard in terms of growing for sure
[2:25:41] gizzmoharding: not a hot take, thats the truth
[2:25:47] ArcaniWolfTv: Whippy, you could say people are making false equivalencies.
[2:25:50] jomrann12: well some streamers have said its harder KEKW
[2:25:56] ramzee_d: Gotta be mentally tough
[2:25:58] CarbonCat101: mentally taxing not physically
[2:25:59] freakinfe3n: That was a luke warm take SMHing
[2:26:06] DOWNBAD_ELLY: True NODDERS I find it subjective where some people find things hard and some people find those things easy Shrug
[2:26:07] Biuntx: ppl stream so they dont wanna work the hard 9-5 jobs
[2:26:21] Gabba0G: streaming is hard as almost every job, just not as hard as other jobs
[2:26:24] iamloyaltytv: Can confirm streaming successfully is hard
[2:26:25] MJT_au: There are a lot of streamers who might not have had a lot of other jobs previously
[2:26:45] Goddimus: every job sucks. it’s a systemic problem
[2:26:55] IamthaKingslayer: u cant enjoy games when streaming them cos people always try spoil the games
[2:26:56] Lunar_Delta: Actual whipDonoWall
[2:27:13] xoduh: It is a job but no where near as bad as soul sucking job
[2:27:16] TylaBlue: I think its just a conversation about 'ease' of earnings compared to a 9-5 thats probably the most compelling thing to argue about
[2:27:17] yolfiic: whipDonoWall
[2:27:27] EvilSandman01: As a strimmer, you are your own boss, you are the owner of your own business. Being the owner of a business is stressful and come with a lot of worries
[2:27:32] smigglesreal: so life's hard not streaming
[2:27:50] JUST_LOCO_: Shit I work for the city I live and they had me working for three days straight with only a hr each day to go home just too go back too work
[2:28:37] drofpaos: I would rather make a guaranteed salary as a plumber (like i am) than have the dynamic and likely lower average of salary from streaming.
[2:28:44] Kingdeathmatch: And lots of deductibles
[2:28:53] woolfdesign: I get it
[2:28:55] TronWeasley: whipFlower
[2:29:05] yolfiic: makes sense
[2:29:06] freakinfe3n: NODDERS it's always on your mind
[2:29:07] gizzmoharding: HARDEST JOB IN THE WORLD, BEEING A PARENT
[2:29:10] Fossabot:  Whippy returns to NoPixel! - https://youtu.be/dvWQK7hZbgM
[2:29:13] MegaKarp101: I saw a streamer say it's easier to be a oil rig worker than a twitch streamer whipSuffer
[2:29:20] TylaBlue: @MegaKarp101 wot
[2:29:22] ImJustAsBad: @Whippy so basically what you are saying is that you have to really LOVE streaming to be a streamer
[2:29:25] MJT_au: Physically hard and mentally hard are different
[2:29:25] ramzee_d: And how is this a hot take?  Sounds reasonable
[2:29:31] itsDaniBear: It's the equivalent of back to back to back meetings for 12 hours in my world, I'd burn out hard after a week
[2:29:31] yolfiic: @MegaKarp101 AINTNOWAY
[2:29:33] freakinfe3n: @megakarp101  AINTNOWAY
[2:29:34] woolfdesign: LUL
[2:29:36] MegaKarp101: @TylaBlue EXACTLY
[2:29:38] mccaw98: And dont forget the company buisness meetings that are conductet by whippy, josh and wompy on the toilet every now and then
[2:29:42] Gabba0G: @MegaKarp101 uff did this person ever see the videos of oil rig-workers... guess not
[2:29:56] jjanieee: I went from a very physical job to a desk job and I would argue sometimes mentally challenging jobs are so much more tiring
[2:29:57] smigglesreal: I'd just like to say all of these things are life. life's very hard
[2:30:05] MegaKarp101: @Gabba0G @Gabba0G THEY WERE WATCHING A OIL RIG CLIP AND SAID IT
[2:30:09] shacklyn: just the amount of talking you do during a given week of streams is extreme
[2:30:14] DanWahWah: did you hear that Mr Taxman, Whompy make 100's of thousands of dollars
[2:30:24] auzzie_assault: Trippy Whippy love ya work mate hope your well
[2:30:25] Gabba0G: @MegaKarp101 wow just wow...
[2:30:29] TylaBlue: If I could get a community based internet job I'd never complain a day in my life AAAA

[2:30:41] Kingdeathmatch: There are alot more resources now then there ever has been. Like stonemountains academy.
[2:30:45] woolfdesign: I saw the robbery happen :D
[2:30:48] MoLove21: its also not easy to play a good character for rp, I've tried and yea not as easy as it seems
