[4:13:01] rav_stlth: i do think the amount of time associated with these charges seems super low, i don't play though just watch so maybe it's w/e

[4:13:33] rav_stlth: i kinda thought it was neat in the past where if you got caught for doing something crazy it was like welp, i'm done for the day
[4:13:51] PockChicken: deputy mayor is strapped
[4:14:05] Sahil6255: TeaTime

[4:16:01] pearjuice: Frost also got prio when she talked to the mayor the other day, now she can go off duty too Gladge

[4:17:03] hankkiller2021: DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance
[4:17:26] rav_stlth: @pearjuice do they actually get in trouble for playing off duty? i feel like that's been alluded to but seems like a weird rule unless it's like a lot of time off duty
[4:17:39] hankkiller2021: DinoDance DinoDance TwitchConHYPE TwitchConHYPE TwitchConHYPE
[4:18:00] pearjuice: tbh i don't fully know how it works either, she just said she couldnt really go off duty, and then he gave her prio
[4:18:40] rav_stlth: yea i remembered her saying that
[4:19:03] serendipity3456: don’t hate me but what does prio
[4:19:09] serendipity3456: mean?
[4:19:18] ArenaKrusher: @rav_stlth im 100% on this, but I think its frowned upon to use your cop prio to get on the server then go off duty, so really helps when cop get prio so they can actually roleplay off duty
[4:19:23] pearjuice: @serendipity3456 priority in the long que for the server
[4:19:24] ArenaKrusher: im not*
[4:19:42] serendipity3456: @pearjuice thank you so much
[4:19:48] ianakaBoogie: classic
[4:19:50] Amandathecookie: RUUF
[4:20:11] pearjuice: @serendipity3456 if you have high prio, you can get in the server easier
[4:21:01] rav_stlth: @ArenaKrusher yea that makes sense for sure, feels like if it was every once in a while like after a long shift or something it wouldn't b e a huge deal

[4:30:18] ArenaKrusher: no i mean cop in the background
[4:30:26] NarcisDuran: Whats this meeting about? State of pd?
[4:30:44] ArenaKrusher: yeah
[4:30:48] evilmnkey4: @NarcisDuran yes they are getting stories from every cop
[4:30:57] SQUIDWARD360: where is a cop in the background
[4:31:07] Sax850: Jenny peepoHappy
[4:31:23] Clodhoppr: pretty sure it was Aldo Jackson that walked by toward the far side of the building
[4:31:28] ArenaKrusher: @SQUIDWARD360 next to the orange thing
[4:31:47] SQUIDWARD360: good eyes
[4:32:53] ArenaKrusher: retention is the biggest problem, half the new cops quit
[4:33:19] Smoogol: Sadge Dupont
[4:33:26] AfricanSnowball: 👀
[4:33:30] SQUIDWARD360: its hard to get new cops because their crim characters have to keep on the gring. You have to commit
[4:33:39] Emaykurrz_: You tell em King!
[4:33:40] KittyTechnician: Jackie about to get hired (hopefully)
[4:33:46] ZotacRP: well said
[4:33:55] thepwnographer: Copleone for Commissioner

[4:34:28] pearjuice: Copleone already gone?
[4:34:36] xsilas43: @Dee__1__ theyve already fired 2 full cops and tons of cadets
[4:34:40] combattingjosh: @pearjuice academy
[4:34:43] evilmnkey4: huge raid
[4:34:44] Emaykurrz_: I love that Jebby came to King for this, she knows that Snu will talk about this stuff as King but that there may be a small read between the lines cause of Jackie
[4:34:45] SQUIDWARD360: Copleone was never hired
[4:34:50] ArenaKrusher: @SQUIDWARD360 not only that but roleplayers that havnt done cop before are overwhelmed by the amount of paperwork and rules to follow and restictions so they give up Sadge
[4:34:50] serendipity3456: w raid
[4:35:12] sarahjsayer1986: uhsLove uhsLove uhsLove uhsLove uhsLove uhsLove uhsLove uhsLove
[4:35:29] IdleElectric: Do you have an extra mic to drop?
[4:35:33] BasedBruh: Man i hope they get rid of the 10 min chase rule
[4:35:41] autisticboots: @arenakrusher yeah paperwork is a MASSIVE issue, especially people getting DAPed for paperwork issues rather than it being simplified and sped up
[4:36:06] AfricanSnowball: 10 min chase rule?
[4:36:24] AfricanSnowball: what is that
[4:36:44] jayjamerson: Never was a 10 minute thing they called chases off if became to dangerous to the public
[4:36:47] BasedBruh: @AfricanSnowball Pretty much gotta break off any non violent chase after 10 mins
[4:36:51] jayjamerson: they have slightly moved away from that
[4:37:08] combattingjosh: @BasedBruh That wasn't a thing. If it got too dangerous, it was called off
[4:37:09] AfricanSnowball: oh ok interesting
[4:37:37] BenZeb: you also can't really dedicate that much resources when you are spread this thin
[4:37:44] SQUIDWARD360: driving away from a traffic stop to get into a 60 minute chase with 3 swaps is kind of dumb
[4:37:53] KidChameleon_: Bring back Gunner Madge
[4:37:56] ArenaKrusher: @AfricanSnowball you wont belive this, but on the very first new "boost" on the server, the lead decided to set a time limit for 15 minutes at the start for when they should break off
[4:38:17] ArenaKrusher: so 4head drove for 15 min with suarez keeping up, then everyone broke off
[4:38:27] AfricanSnowball: eh it is what it is
[4:38:34] ArenaKrusher: yeah very boring
[4:38:36] LuckyCharmsForBreakfast: the timing was impeccable
[4:38:53] dreamquest1989: Its not really a a bad thing. better break off. then 2 hours persuits
[4:38:54] xsilas43: I understand not wanting chases to go 2h all the time but a lot of drug calls come from traffic stops, im still on the side of the 10m rule tho fuck 2h chases every time KEKW
[4:39:01] the_only_tetra: @AfricanSnowball peepoHey snowball
[4:39:32] AnusReaktorMan: Does she stream?

[4:39:53] ianakaBoogie: nikkisariot @AnusReaktorMan
[4:40:28] xsilas43: @AfricanSnowball yea i think that would solve a lot of issues if they could get it working properly without desync
[4:40:42] evilmnkey4: omg that name
[4:40:43] LuckyCharmsForBreakfast: @africansnowball back to 2.0 cars 🤮
[4:40:46] autisticboots: there needs to be more specialisation
[4:40:57] Xi_HYPERION_iX: Get me pictures of Spider Man!
[4:40:59] AfricanSnowball: desync is just an acceptable risk at this point LUL

[4:41:51] serendipity3456: 😆
[4:42:05] LuckyCharmsForBreakfast: yes
[4:42:06] eri_frost: yes
[4:42:07] AfricanSnowball: is this a list of grievances within the PD?
[4:42:07] iTzAsaeI: yes

[4:42:10] ianakaBoogie: NODDERS

[4:42:11] Picklz: yes
[4:42:12] Mission_Ctrl: mehdiNodders
[4:42:36] autisticboots: i think one particular Snr is a BIG problem for the PD
[4:42:40] retrost1: @AfricanSnowball basically. PD fell way behind so they are being audited to try to fix it
[4:42:52] ArenaKrusher: @AfricanSnowball the mayor ordered a audit of PD, Jenny is leading it
[4:43:14] StreamElements: If you would like to support my stream you can subscribe here! twitch.tv/uhsnow/subscribe

[4:43:27] retrost1: there was one a guy that always told pd to have a nice day all the time and now they dont have that
[4:43:39] ArenaKrusher: @PurpaMint yeah maybe you are right
[4:43:46] Blizzard5050: I think the whole council is working independently
[4:43:52] Blizzard5050: so each does their own interviews

[4:46:13] ArenaKrusher: and there was a queue
[4:46:25] LuckyCharmsForBreakfast: and if you want to go north
[4:46:46] CyboargTV: Server max is what? 200? Yeah 20 makes sense then
[4:46:48] SQUIDWARD360: @ArenaKrusher i never remember that
[4:47:11] SQUIDWARD360: maybe after tsunami
[4:47:35] Achello: get rid of ruth LUL
[4:47:37] Littlebootz: hire snow :P
[4:47:39] ArenaKrusher: @SQUIDWARD360 there was a time in the middle of 3.0 in the Pred times where morale was very good, shift 1 always had 20+

[4:48:04] rnAlsation: What about, instead, free snow cones for life?
[4:48:11] Achello: Snow for captain
[4:48:15] LuckyCharmsForBreakfast: MackMotors we need you
[4:48:18] kerndeezy: free slushies peepoRiot
[4:48:24] KjetilHestvik: tear in my eye as i got ziggy up on the second monitor
[4:48:25] AKAmadio: King for Commissioner
[4:48:31] KidChameleon_: where the morale cops at modCheck
[4:48:32] CyboargTV: @ArenaKrusher Yeah 20 sounds comfy for cops then, a lil more or less would let them cover most things
[4:48:35] tenGreg: SnuPOG pepeGun
[4:48:45] Prollos: @AfricanSnowball past cops have had to make new cops to join and for example snow is still stuck at probation phase as he hasnt been given a final eval, it restricts what they can do uhsNodders
[4:49:07] Littlebootz: free morale boost boris for hugs
[4:49:19] AfricanSnowball: interesting
[4:49:20] SQUIDWARD360: why they sit on cops like King without promoting him is just lazy
[4:49:37] washed_up_wapiti: helicopter ;)
[4:49:48] LuckyCharmsForBreakfast: is there mandatory hrs for crim/cops. people with multiple mains
[4:50:05] ArenaKrusher: @CyboargTV shift 2 currently have 15-20 cops in prime time, and they can hardly respond to anything, that is because there is a lot of inner PD roleplay tho right now
[4:50:08] Nohbob: Shift 1, in 3.0 was a powerhouse, Shift 2 was brutal due to burnout, and most of the mainstays went over to onyx.
[4:50:22] the_only_tetra: @Prollos watt told him earlier the first is when his time for ppo done or words to that effect
[4:50:38] SQUIDWARD360: because of the RP most cops spend alot of time on roofs
[4:51:11] Paupor: Hmm
[4:51:23] CyboargTV: Always comes back to the Captains

[4:56:31] ArenaKrusher: @KrazenSG the mass hiring in 3.0 was a problem because it was mostly people that had never roleplayed cop before, what everyone is suggesting now is hiring the old guard that already has experiance so should not be as bad
[4:57:38] xRedjustice: xRedjustice subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months, currently on a 22 month streak!

[5:01:41] KrazenSG: @ArenaKrusher Sadly the Lore is that the 3.0 PD and Government failed. So it kinda flies in the face of that narrative. So mass hiring "the Old Guard" is counter to the story.

[5:12:32] allbiino: i doing well mate how u doing looking good btw ;)
[5:12:39] autisticboots: Honestly, i just disagree with Slacks constantly taking the hit from people n doing things for Ruth constantly rather than her doing things as well
[5:12:58] autisticboots: like when Slacks was the only one doing Den Zel’s review
[5:13:03] Beopuppy85: I like the Albert character. Youve done a good job seperating them. I imagine it would have been easy to slip into Jackie mode
[5:13:06] Iconoclast117: @uhSnow if u bring Jackie in he would clash with the mayor

[5:13:50] ArenaKrusher: fat positivity kills people LUL
[5:13:52] Beopuppy85: I struggle to put on weight. Im underweight for my height and i have a stupid metabolism.

[5:13:59] Knallbanditten: You've done a good job creating a new character, despite joining a PD with a lot of the same people, with characters and voices, very similar to the ones from the old PD. So have a lot of the others
[5:14:00] Emaykurrz_: Nice! I've lost 5lbs so far! You talking about your journey has definitely help!
[5:14:01] MaliciousIntent17: as I sit here eating 3 muffins

[5:14:35] crispysnowball: I am fat and now that snow is looking real good i am Madge
[5:14:41] Stealthkillah122: Have you seen the fat people demanding they get a second seat free on a plane as the seats   are apparently too small for ( large ) people lmao
[5:14:42] RealGasoline: I'm fat as shit, I only started losing weight recently, feeling better
[5:14:48] ben0809: @the_only_tetra staree Kissahomie
[5:14:52] the_only_tetra: @twisty_mc good shit
[5:14:57] autisticboots: i’ve genuinely just struggled to eat healthy foods, like putting veg in my mouth genuinely makes me bork and it’s so hard because my pallet is so small compared to most people

[5:15:18] Beopuppy85: Im 65 kg, i need to get to 75kg or so. Its a struggle
[5:15:18] kirkis123: thats what the show is about
[5:15:23] TheNotoriousKEV: i dont like when people fuck with people for how they look, fat, skinny, whatever, but to say being fat is healthy is just not true. its just a matter of not being an asshole to someone
[5:15:24] VerityNS: Exactly if people are not satisfied how they look they should change if they can for sure. Healthy thinking imo
[5:15:25] ArenaKrusher: basicly scripted crap about them "trying" to lose weight
[5:15:32] StarWhistle517: smack my belly
[5:15:35] StarWhistle517: uhsDAD
[5:15:45] ItsMandaKatarina: A healthy body and a useful body are what I try to focus on.
[5:15:47] autisticboots: since being unemployed as well i’ve struggled so much with routine which was so good when being in school, since leaving school i’ve struggled to maintain consistency massively
[5:15:56] Emaykurrz_: The only thing you are is old uhsBoomer uhsBoomer uhsBoomer
[5:15:58] allbiino: loosing weight or gaining weight is a hard thing to work on depending on your metabolism, i been coaching people now for a couple of years now, but yea people are really dissrespectfull in the time we live in at the moment
[5:16:02] Firasputinv: OMEGAKEKW
[5:16:04] autisticboots: i’m 20 now and still struggling with routine
[5:16:11] Rolling_Thunder197: good train of thought @ItsMandaKatarina
[5:16:39] autisticboots: covid gave me time to just genuinely focus on myself and i was at my fittest and healthiest, since coming out of covid i’ve just declined massively
[5:16:42] AnalgesicPM: Royale w/ Cheese
[5:16:43] anulvision: oh man lockdown Burger Kings absolutely hit different
[5:16:44] Stealthkillah122: What annoys me most is these fat  people who demand they get free seats on planes xD
[5:16:44] Beopuppy85: I dont like the taste of BK
[5:16:46] combattingjosh: I'm just a person where I can eat practically anything and I literally don't point on weight. But, I need to put on muscle though
[5:16:47] Sanivay: Ya idk why that happens really
[5:16:49] Szonin: fast food doesn't still hunger
[5:16:52] Firasputinv: Bro covid made me gain 25KGs it took me 2.5 years to lose that TrollDespair
[5:16:57] ArenaKrusher: people will rather avoid risking to offend anyone than telling them the truth that can improve their life LUL
[5:17:14] SteelMintMedic: Snow, I draw blood as part of my job. You should see what someones blood looks like after eating a fast food meal like McDonald's.
[5:17:19] Stealthkillah122: Good on you for improving yourself
[5:17:20] Addietwo: Dad bod
[5:17:23] Rolling_Thunder197: mate, I loved the Caesar Crispy Chicken McWraps I used to get,  just one of those? very filling
[5:17:25] Jackinabox1998: I think also people use the term 'fat' quite flippantly. Its quite a subjective term
[5:17:33] Firasputinv: Yeah I feel that man lol
[5:17:33] anulvision: twink snow NODDERS
[5:17:39] Beopuppy85: Ive realised that alot of calorie intake i have weekly is alcohol. If i quit drinking ill lose so much fucking weight. Im between a rock and hard place

[5:17:41] TheShaunBro: Toned bollywood actor
[5:17:55] serendipity3456: talking about food is making me hungry
[5:17:55] Jelmer7: Dad bod is comfy bod

[5:18:13] TheNotoriousKEV: people feel shitty about being fat, they dont need other people shitting on them for it lol
[5:18:14] the_only_tetra: alcohol is alot of empty calories @Beopuppy85 NODDERS

[5:18:56] combattingjosh: I was considering it, but now I've considered weights and stuff instead
[5:18:59] Rolling_Thunder197: I can't be fucked to buy a gym membership
[5:19:00] jacoby5356: That's cause I am better than you bruh
[5:19:00] Caetano73: get like me chat
[5:19:01] autisticboots: i feel like once i find a job i enjoy, i can establish a healthier lifestyle and routine around that job. i’ve only worked jobs i’ve hated and still not found anything i’ve genuinely enjoyed so once i find something i enjoy i feel like that’ll impact me more
[5:19:04] MartMonster: I used to go to the gym 3-4x a week, but I don't have the motivation anymore LUL

[5:19:36] Gh0stRP: funny enough, my friend started going in like 5 days a week and since then, he's been an asshole more than usual KEKW
[5:19:37] SteelMintMedic: tbh, only reason I go is because of the environment. there is a bunch of people who are super positive and motive each other.
[5:19:38] Solidknight2112: Gyms are worthless unless you know what you're doing. And I don't know what I'm doing.
[5:19:41] Sanivay: Just tell em your a cop in a video game theyll back off
[5:19:43] TheNotoriousKEV: i cant wait for the clip of snow yelling "get off my benc bruh" to be taken out of context
