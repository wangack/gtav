[5:25:44] Lepaca: Im playing nightingale now, I like it so far
[5:25:51] Romflo_: I'm on the fence as well. I'm the worst builder in the history of gaming, so I'm sure that I'll continue that trend in this game.
[5:27:43] Romflo_: I should look at vids for ideas. I remember that build you did with Strippin on Conan back in the day. That was insane.
[5:29:02] mordhaustv: i love conan, one of my fav games.
[5:29:09] dryline25: fortnite Kappa
[5:29:11] Romflo_: Conan's is really solid.

[5:32:29] mordhaustv: when was the last time they have played conan Tim? cause they have added pieces to the stormglass set, a couple have added white to them.
[5:33:20] mordhaustv: maybe valheim has the best building?
[5:34:30] OldKH: I enjoy Fallout building
[5:34:48] JoshWhittaker4: yeah that‚Äôs true it‚Äôs a very different style of rp maybe the reason I like watching it so much at the time is because it was something different and new
