[0:26:11] harpiebirb: its a very energy intensive game
[0:26:12] Kabhaal: FAIR.
[0:26:13] imtwopie: Helldivers suffers from being the same gamemode over and over, mixed with poor server architecture atm
[0:26:15] imtwopie: its rough!
[0:26:15] TitaniumTurtle9: geegaPray server update today
[0:26:15] seedsu: gta is like RP subway surfers
[0:26:17] imtwopie: It will get better
[0:26:18] TrevortheModeratelySavage: Unlike Zen who has been consumed by it

[0:27:29] TitaniumTurtle9: @flamebirdphoenix I do believe they are adding server space today for the update
[0:27:38] tsumibito13: Was thinking of buying Helldivers II, but will hold off until the servers are less burdened. No sense is paying $40 for a game I can't  play :(

[0:29:35] TitaniumTurtle9: I've been playing the shit out of tiny rouges
[0:29:52] TheMadMatter: Can't wait for the other 2 classes to be out
[0:29:54] PagsPayback: Hi Geega!
[0:30:04] imtwopie: Yeah!
[0:30:04] seedsu: tiny rogues is great
[0:30:07] TitaniumTurtle9: geegaNODDERS
[0:30:07] lunorx6: hello everyone!
[0:30:14] xman1101: pizza tower
[0:30:20] TheMadMatter: Brotato man
[0:30:23] stachystat: yeah fleshing it out is a lot of work and needs more investment
[0:30:23] imobaka: the focus on the great idea, yea. and that's it
[0:30:25] Starsky3012: NOTED
[0:30:32] seedsu: im still mad that the devs of necropolis abandoned it that game was great
[0:30:43] xman1101: binding of Isaac clasic
[0:30:43] leshnator: Sadge
[0:30:46] kyulen742: sajj
[0:30:50] Starsky3012: Sadge
[0:30:54] dziabog: Smoge
[0:30:57] thehousemasterr: Sadge
[0:30:59] Starsky3012: Smoge RainTime
[0:31:06] King_floppy: I keep seeing Rogue Genesis get updates so they must be doing giod
[0:31:09] TitaniumTurtle9: Deadcells was a good example of a game that continued to update due to the support
[0:31:14] Goldmoon627: Creatures
[0:31:37] TitaniumTurtle9: geegaNODDERS
[0:31:37] imobaka: what is missing most of the time is a sense of progress, a journey, a world map, sth like that
[0:31:39] King_floppy: Rogue Genesia*
[0:31:40] stachystat: that's super cheap
[0:31:40] ashketchup5543: Void stranger is my new favorite indie game
[0:31:48] numbertwodooky: the game is great, still play it til now
[0:31:56] TheMadMatter: God I cant wait for Rift Wizard 2
[0:32:00] KingArchlich: Sadge PokeyPoke has been a demo for years...
[0:32:08] xman1101: this is like basicly the binding of Isaac since like it’s a 30 minute game at 1st then it’s a 45 minute game or a 50 minute game
[0:32:09] TitaniumTurtle9: Still worth
[0:32:14] kyulen742: nise
[0:32:14] NoSpacesDan: thats a good investment doubled up EZ
[0:32:16] processr: see also: Vampire Survivors (not that it got expensive when they increased the price lmao)
[0:32:17] reconzar: think of it as an appreciating asset
[0:32:19] Starsky3012: 100% price increase geegaOgey Kappa
[0:32:21] bagelpost: i've been putting a ton of time into the balatro demo and now it's finally out today
[0:32:22] xman1101: but then like when you do so much it’s like a 1:30 long game
[0:32:34] reconzar: its an actual investment if its worth more now
[0:32:45] imobaka: wishlist
[0:32:46] xman1101: I think the binding of Isaac was like the 1st big indie support game
[0:32:50] takamura_face: takamura_face subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! Thanks for 7 months Boss geegaSalute
[0:33:02] leshnator: Oh, that's cool.
[0:33:02] lasagnalover: to think Balatro got big basically cause Dan recommended it to his friends
[0:33:03] kyulen742: notee
[0:33:11] xman1101: since an entire major dlc was orginaly made by fans
[0:33:11] stachystat: ahh wishlists help recommendations makes sense
[0:33:22] seedsu: im still mad that the devs of necropolis abandoned it that game was great 󠀀
[0:33:23] lushenzener: Officially, wishlisting doesn't provide a boost. Unofficially, there's a reason why every indie dev pushes for wishlists.
[0:33:26] thehousemasterr: what happened with the dead cell devs?
[0:33:34] processr: ok good cos I just posted it in suggestions for IGG lmao
[0:33:35] TitaniumTurtle9: @xman1101 true definetly one of the original big indies
[0:33:49] TitaniumTurtle9: geegaNODDERS
[0:33:57] stachystat: which is totally fair
[0:34:04] Jath010: impossible
[0:34:07] sweetbleek: terraria devs Aware
[0:34:08] Nexus1203: Not every game can be Terraria with the devs still going at it
[0:34:09] lasagnalover: no, only work on same thing forever Madge
[0:34:10] FrostedGlas: @lushenzener It does notify that friends have that on their wishlist at the very least.
[0:34:10] TheMadMatter: Its finished
[0:34:14] Eldritch_Jester: Same for the risk of rain dev
[0:34:15] xman1101: yeah but Edmund will come back to Isaac every year and add something hew
[0:34:17] imobaka: looking forward to anything new they will create
[0:34:21] zoingo: monsters
[0:34:26] Jamil_1472: dunno if you noticed yet but Anthony jusf message you on discord
[0:34:29] xman1101: like repentance was the complet egame
[0:34:32] sweetbleek: NODDERS
[0:34:40] seedsu: rimworld is a prime example of that tbh
[0:34:41] leshnator: It's great when a game is complete and left that way,
[0:34:45] xman1101: but now they have multiplayer offical Isaac
[0:34:48] zoingo: It's good to let projects end!
[0:34:48] kirisimpthecowboy: Halloo
