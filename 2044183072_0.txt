[1:25:20] RuleofBooKz: This nerve is linked to the “sneeze center” of the brainstem and sends signals that prompt a person to sneeze. It usually occurs when something like dust or pollen irritates the mucus membranes of the nose and throat.

[1:49:15] KiloCaeso: Alex might know
[1:49:16] M0hkofantti: I think there is nothing to put outside
[1:49:16] 42arc: try it and se eif temperature changes in the house
[1:49:26] Q_Erisa: you need fan
[1:49:29] ProjectPain1: some of those vents go inside and some do outside
[1:49:31] nuhbinho: those are all for the roof
[1:49:35] cebron808: think its only used for weed ig
[1:49:36] f1ywhiteguy: theres roof vents too
[1:49:43] IronPitRat: sorry Al
[1:49:50] jas3y: these all seem like roof vents
[1:49:52] caligirlbeaches: you can put them on the walls or floor
[1:49:58] JsLeos: those vents might be aesthetic though no?
[1:50:01] BoJackJohnsson: Im pretty sure no one in chat playes on NoPixel so i think you have to ask someone in the server that have done testing to see what workes
[1:50:03] riadaich: use the small one
[1:50:09] Clodhoppr: need it inside
[1:50:12] vcertified_goat: Hello 👋 @acie
[1:50:15] Drock1n: that’s like a dryer vent for outside the house

[1:50:18] luis_king82: the first floor vent... the others you make the cold circulate
[1:50:18] stopandrun: yea

[1:50:28] fewe___: ask someone on the server
[1:50:30] Kangaroo_Balls: vent out that weird indented area on second floor
[1:50:30] TheMrWiik: you should use vents that are roof mounted

[1:50:35] JsLeos: is she making references lmao
[1:50:39] 42arc: yes, through the floors Sure
[1:50:40] f1ywhiteguy: heat rises technically
[1:50:40] marklovegaming: This is fun to watch lol
[1:50:50] JsLeos: the word vent is so weird now OMEGALUL
[1:50:55] jinhzoo: then ppl will know you have racks and make you a bigger target imo
[1:50:57] Q_Erisa: did they make a 2nd key?
[1:51:01] basards: you need AC and ducting to cool the room
[1:51:03] 42arc: yep
[1:51:03] StreamElements: YEP COCK
[1:51:03] Hikamari: all you need is a random fan i dont think you have to connect it like this throught the whole house
[1:51:08] Deventerwarrior: You might be able to just build a fan inside and a Vent outside and it magically connects
[1:51:10] 42arc: lower maybe
[1:51:13] ekahS_: that's what she said
[1:51:13] xczak: I would hide it somehow
[1:51:19] nuhbinho: you just need flat vents in walls or ceilings I think, ask Alex
[1:51:24] Nulltiply: 4Head Just turn the racks off
[1:51:26] 42arc: vent might work for now
[1:51:28] tayda_wy: the house aleady has a chemeny from the outside?
[1:51:30] f1ywhiteguy: creep on other other rack houses

[1:51:38] ProjectPain1: Couldnt you just use ceiling fans to disburse the air?
[1:51:38] Kangaroo_Balls: you can hide ducting in that weird indended area of 2nd floor room
[1:51:41] gembitskymatvei: Hello acieFLOWER
[1:51:47] RavagedPistol: I doubt its this complicated
[1:51:50] TremarGJI: the mechanics are not that crazy, you can probably put in anywhere in the house and it would work, just make it look good and make sense
[1:51:57] jas3y: maybe yuno could give some advice if u catch him
[1:51:58] GRAYURSUSTANA: theres no way the game is that realistic chat, xqc just stuck a vent on the wall and its fine. try just adding a random vent and see if ventilation goes up on the console
[1:52:02] basards: you can ask Mr rivers
[1:52:05] Clodhoppr: ngl i'd just relog
[1:52:12] 1iwill: it seems like this kinda thing should be shared...like why do you have to figure out how this works lol

[5:41:55] DaftFrik: could try a sliding door in the floor and drop down?
[5:41:58] courage_ag: Nora needs to kick rocks
[5:42:00] Kenjack1984: and the back of the closet is the entrance
[5:42:04] 42arc: secret room should be tiny, so it's not obvious, otherwise it's easy to find
[5:42:05] jas3y: could do a little labrynth kind of set up with rooms u need to walk through to get to the secret door

[5:44:14] Living54: or does it not use power if it has no components inside?
[5:44:19] 42arc: main pc should be hidden
[5:44:21] solitude_twitch_: 👋
[5:44:22] Mr_Stevex: put the pc up to glass then on other side move wall to the back of other pc
[5:44:22] Kangaroo_Balls: Just curious why make it secret, is there anything illegal about it?
[5:44:25] GRAYURSUSTANA: that looks nice

[5:46:09] f1ywhiteguy: over 9000
[5:46:18] AFFABLE__: The PC has the HDD which holds the Coin, the PC needs to be protected.
[5:46:31] LadyDima: Bedge
[5:46:37] asheryy1: i think its a must for the pc that is connected to the racks to be near racks
[5:46:38] kr4kk3nn: im all caught up with the Dexx drama that's crazy mans is a savage lmao
[5:46:40] f1ywhiteguy: oh hey @LadyDima
[5:46:41] schibbitywah: Yes
[5:46:42] BoJackJohnsson: Before you do any more you should let them test if the PC´s is close enuff to the servers
[5:46:42] Zodalite: Yes
[5:46:42] Downunder3969: you’re gunna need some ventilation
[5:46:43] Mr_Stevex: yrs

[5:47:08] Raivolver: server along the wall and 1 pc in the middle?
[5:47:12] Stankyfinga: u could easily fit 10 with 1 pc
[5:47:19] iHarsh29: this is taking too much space
[5:47:23] Fallinxdd: 9 is good i think
[5:47:24] crafty279: the old layout was perfect for 10...
[5:47:25] f1ywhiteguy: how much of the rack room fire was lack of ventilation?
[5:47:32] asheryy1: @Stankyfinga YEP
[5:47:33] schibbitywah: Blue lights in the rack room would look sick
[5:47:37] nuhbinho: you will have a nice aisle for ventilation now that there is a lot of space in there
[5:47:42] OnionKni9ht: important thing is the hide main pc with coins in it
[5:47:47] riadaich: the original design was good for 6
[5:47:51] iHarsh29: last idea was good
[5:47:52] ironbullman: this smal corner was perfet for hiding it too
[5:48:07] vanzkie21: move the glass to make server room smaller?
[5:48:11] Ginoveli: acieWADDLE
[5:48:24] Azyraft: -27
[5:48:24] Capt4inJuli: -27

[5:48:56] P_Herbo24: Do they need to be hidden chat ?
[5:49:01] qtMTK: Evening chat, looking lovely as always peepoSitHey
[5:49:08] f1ywhiteguy: have you considered bluelight glasses?
[5:49:09] ekahS_: @qtMTK peepoSitHey
[5:49:12] Anesthetize_d: SAJ
[5:49:15] Stankyfinga: could u put a wall in front of the glass wall that is far enough over that u could walk through between the walls.. that way it would kinda conceal it
[5:49:22] Stankyfinga: i dunno if that made sense
[5:49:23] NovoPoroDego: !lurk
[5:49:23] StreamElements: NovoPoroDego is now lurking acieLURK
[5:49:27] Obedient_potato: SAJ
[5:49:29] brandonsux: SAJ
[5:49:30] Ginoveli: aw
[5:49:33] Janizu: no reason to hide them ppl will find them just put them behind locked door
[5:49:34] KnocturnalSLO: Bluelight glasses are a joke
[5:49:37] basards: cant you hide the 3rd floor
[5:49:38] sazogrim: They work
[5:49:39] Linds_Brohan: I love my blue light glasses
[5:49:59] asheryy1: @Stankyfinga that's smart
[5:50:10] ironbullman: i still dont get the lock system OMEGALUL if anyone can unlock front door they can do that here too
[5:50:16] Kangaroo_Balls: You probably concentrating so much that your not blinking enough
[5:50:21] Stankyfinga: @Stankyfinga u know that might be the first time someone has told me that.... thank u lol
[5:50:32] KnocturnalSLO: U can adjust monitor light and colors to be friendly for eyes. No need for glasses
[5:50:33] shdwking420: the island looked better IMO
[5:50:54] Dysotopia: i think you can key it differntly no?
[5:50:58] asheryy1: @Stankyfinga KEKW nmpL
[5:51:08] Kangaroo_Balls: But if owner with key unlocks front, at least a guest can't open the secret room lock
[5:51:14] Thunderpint: I mean if you're only doing 10 the old config would save room
[5:51:26] Slaydess7: @Kangaroo_Balls true
[5:51:27] Roro_____: would be too op
[5:51:28] Hollowshaun: acieHEART acieHYPERS acieHEART
[5:51:28] vanzkie21: so the pc inside is the main pc? that's smart
[5:51:34] crafty279: you 100% got oneguyed because someone sent you a pretty picture of a layout
[5:51:34] kr4kk3nn: there are keypad doors im pretty sure
[5:51:35] asheryy1: in the future maybe devs would add it
[5:51:49] basards: hide the 3rd floor
[5:52:00] 1iwill: What don't you like?
[5:52:01] KnocturnalSLO: Doors with code not key
[5:52:04] SSGHaseeb: left right and middle in yes @Acie fruitNerd
[5:52:13] fewe___: looking too much at chat opinion ngl
[5:52:19] Thunderpint: Fair

[5:52:28] P_Herbo24: have they said the planned on adding more ?
[5:52:30] ekahS_: @fewe___ you must be new here
[5:52:34] TTUCROWN: they can’t have more than ten.  the house willl blow up
[5:52:36] KnocturnalSLO: Prob no
[5:52:38] Huhzzzz: i love you
[5:52:45] fewe___: @ekahS_ YEP
[5:52:49] schibbitywah: Nobody knows. Its the future.
[5:52:52] jas3y: if u flipped the "middle" desk to the back wall could u make that little room more narrow? and then put these left and right desk against the glass wall with the door between maybe?
[5:52:54] Zodalite: Can you "mirror" objects in this game?
[5:52:55] StreamElements: Zodalite, no
[5:52:59] ekahS_: @fewe___ guess why we have OneGuy as an emote
[5:53:01] tayda_wy: you can have the desk where they were originally but in a cube form
[5:53:07] TTUCROWN: y’all will have a mansion by then
[5:53:09] KnocturnalSLO: Moving out 1 pc won't be that hard if needed
[5:53:14] ironbullman: naa u'll be pro at this by then PepeLaugh
[5:53:19] Thunder_Nikk: Is there blood on the floor
[5:53:20] Hollowshaun: yeah they do
[5:53:23] 1iwill: Don't think more than 10 would be necessary.  That's like 10ish coins per day right?  In a week you should be stockpiling
[5:53:23] justCoopp: u shit on us all the time wdym
[5:53:25] TSMDataMiner: You can fire your mods KEKW
[5:53:25] asheryy1: @ekahS_ we are used to nick he never reads chat
[5:53:26] Flashthatuuu: Why don’t you just ask if they will do more than 10
[5:53:27] justCoopp: it goes both ways
[5:53:28] GRAYURSUSTANA: i would flip all the server racks 90 degrees with this new setup, it makes more sense for access with the glass door
[5:53:29] Hollowshaun: how dare they Vee
[5:53:30] IggleGreen: The future? Brother theyll just buy a new house
[5:53:32] Xerhro: goAcie goAcie goAcie goAcie goAcie goAcie goAcie goAcie goAcie
[5:53:40] ekahS_: @asheryy1 NODDERS
[5:53:43] Phasehero: Ask yourself @acie what else would that space be used for?
[5:54:08] Hikamari: It takes 10 seconds to move stuff... You dont really need to think about it that much
[5:54:20] stopandrun: touch L & R computers and move brown wall closer?
[5:54:26] Nulltiply: Kappa
[5:54:27] StreamElements: Kappa
[5:54:35] ironbullman: bruh shes just laying there deaad OMEGALUL

[5:54:50] Logan121Wright: You're doing Great nmpD nmpD nmpBLANKIES nmpBLANKIES
[5:54:52] BoomerPaw: dead Sure
[5:55:11] tayda_wy: maybe turn the raks sideways so you have more room in that space and have the desks and raks in that small room ????????
[5:55:39] vanzkie21: you can move things without removing stuff no? just dont put it in your inventory?
[5:55:44] basards: ask them how the would like them
[5:55:52] basards: show them
[5:56:05] CRlCK: Nerd
[5:56:07] nomoreheroes__: Vee you should move the sever racks and put the stairs in that location
[5:56:07] tayda_wy: if yhey turn sideways you can have like 5 raks per line
[5:56:22] Janizu: with the current system police and owner gets an alert when some1 fails lockpicking ur door so adding more doors increases the chance that the person fails at some point
[5:56:25] basards: then do it the way you like it ,,,
[5:56:27] DataCookie: I think nick would be happy with just computers and racks in the house with 1 light
[5:56:29] SSGHaseeb: main is middle one fruitNerd fruitNerd
[5:56:34] axmxixrx: thats true none of them really care about the design beside you
[5:56:57] consequences77: can you not put the desk in the corner??
[5:56:57] StreamElements: consequences77, no
[5:57:08] realJokoWidodo: move bench in there too
[5:57:20] iHarsh29: that small room can have everything
[5:57:25] Tresch: Plan in some space, you never know whats coming in the future
[5:57:31] Kangaroo_Balls: Can never have too many
[5:57:32] StreamElements: Kangaroo_Balls, no
[5:57:45] axmxixrx: you can have rows of 6 - 5 -5 -5
[5:58:03] riadaich: punsh one of them
[5:58:05] courage_ag: You should tell nick you need 30k
[5:58:23] asheryy1: @Kangaroo_Balls clay said after 10 racks it might catch fire
[5:58:25] Flashthatuuu: Yeah these guys don’t care about anything except coin and erp.
[5:58:31] Ginoveli: acieWADDLE
[5:58:32] iHarsh29: you can fit all in that tiny room
[5:58:42] maikkekku: Ask money Jason got you
[5:58:50] basards: make it how you want it ... you are doing all the work not them
[5:58:56] pandamercc: You think you can run Apex on those PC's?
[5:58:58] khanoute: Raia went to bed?
[5:58:58] Kangaroo_Balls: @asheryy1 ah ok
[5:59:05] KnocturnalSLO: 10 racks with ventilation or without?
[5:59:14] ANTiN0VA: You should put the hidden entryway behind the stairs
[5:59:16] randomd00d123: undo clayton
[5:59:22] Hikamari: Use the XL walls on the bottom floor when you can put them to the floor so you can save money
[5:59:28] jas3y: thoughts on spinning the single pc 90 degress and putting it against the back wall beside the racks?
[5:59:36] sixnineenjoyer: try the xl
[5:59:37] 1iwill: Do you think you might want to charge other ppl to decorate their houses after yours?
[5:59:46] m331o: is ther a way to ctrl+c the glass and walls?
[5:59:51] Rokuach: Why not just use one xxl?
[5:59:53] gruegd: Why not stack the glass panes vertically instead of horizontally?
[5:59:54] qihk: is it really a hidden room if its taking up half of the room
[5:59:58] asheryy1: @KnocturnalSLO they are not sure yet
[6:00:00] kujoez: what does the snap movement slider in the top right do? @acie
[6:00:15] Zodalite: Is there aluminium frames in between the glass parts?
[6:00:16] courage_ag: Stop being to nice
[6:00:25] iHarsh29: yep it's not hidden room if you take half of floor makes no sense
[6:00:28] Tarikws: It looks more realistic this way anyway
[6:00:30] jas3y: could always snap through the floor worst case
[6:00:51] Hollowshaun: pause
[6:00:52] iHarsh29: if you can fit everything in that small corner room it can be hidden rom
[6:00:59] chinnook: thicc
[6:01:16] BoJackJohnsson: And maybe tinted. Now you cant realy see it
[6:01:17] jas3y: can u flip that side ways and stick it through wall and floor? or is that powerful gaming
[6:01:17] StreamElements: jas3y, no
[6:01:20] Thunderpint: Yeah too thick keep doing you with the large if you have the mats
[6:01:23] nuhbinho: @kujoez i think you set it so that items spin by a set amount of degrees istead of spinning freely
[6:01:42] Hikamari: More objects = more lag just use xl when you can
[6:01:45] maikkekku: Why does it need to be hidden when you have 3 empty floors. No need to stuff in small box
[6:01:45] Damon_James: i dont know how you can work with them just standing there. it would drive me crazy
[6:01:57] Rokuach: Snap allows you to rotate or move a certain amount, so if you have it set to 10 snap the item will move by 10 units at a time when you move it or rotate it. So its easier to align things together
[6:02:03] GRAYURSUSTANA: the vents are fake anyway just put one on the wall
[6:02:09] vyjinx: cant u vent from above?
[6:02:09] soniclink10: Up into the overhang area
[6:02:11] basards: do the ACfirst if you can
[6:02:17] JalapenYoFace: Yo ✌️
[6:02:18] ANTiN0VA: What if you just put a vent in the floor?
[6:02:22] SireNizmo: I think glass walls with a frame would look better, like the door kinda. But Idk if they exist.
[6:02:35] Hikamari: Yes
[6:02:36] jas3y: sounds like it from what a few people have said in chat so far
[6:02:37] riadaich: don’t know
[6:02:37] GRAYURSUSTANA: the game isnt that realistic
[6:02:46] ANTiN0VA: So the heat distributes through the house
[6:02:49] Rokuach: There's also double sliding glass doors
[6:02:50] tayda_wy: leave space near the wall small enough for a vent but people cant fit through ?
[6:02:57] asheryy1: ask nino or tell nick to ask nino he knows
[6:02:57] kr4kk3nn: i think the sytem just needs to register that there is a vent in the room
[6:03:00] micas290: LUL
[6:03:05] kujoez: @nuhbinho oh I thought it would connect to another piece you already placed.
[6:03:05] micas290: clayton trying to pass
[6:03:08] BuuCacky: holy fuck that's thick lol
[6:03:20] asheryy1: nino is an admin he know about it for sure
[6:03:20] vanzkie21: is that a bulletproof glass
[6:03:26] GRAYURSUSTANA: just place a vent and see if the ventilation goes up on the house console
[6:03:27] ToTheSameHeights: yes better door
[6:03:28] RealWicari: that some bulletproof glass right there
[6:03:28] Hikamari: Just place random went and see on the control panel if there s +1 ventilation
[6:03:29] huupzi: yea
[6:03:33] JalapenYoFace: What's this for?
[6:03:34] basards: go what you like
[6:03:34] 1iwill: Are there thicker doors?
[6:03:37] Xerhro: Bullet proof glass YEP
[6:03:39] tayda_wy: thin horizontal?
[6:03:44] Fallinxdd: thats fine
[6:03:47] BoJackJohnsson: Its bulletproof aswell and trust me, guns are going to be a thing... Might save you some day
[6:03:48] Flugger1: People don't know that, they just think it's how that works
[6:03:49] ANTiN0VA: You could raise it so you have a half wall upstairs
[6:03:51] ironbullman: modCheck
[6:03:57] riadaich: a dawg
[6:03:59] dimma7: it could've been added to the server
[6:04:00] tayda_wy: 2 thin in top of each other
[6:04:21] GRAYURSUSTANA: use another large glass piece on the other side of the door and make it go inside the wall
[6:04:25] Rokuach: Double sliding door and then you just need less large glass walls
[6:04:26] Damon_James: brie i trust your interior design choices over chats LUL
[6:04:32] Janizu: or another xl right side clip it to wall
[6:04:32] axmxixrx: this is good now the thick one looks better
[6:04:33] Kangaroo_Balls: looks good to me
[6:04:35] TTUCROWN: just save it and see what it looks like
[6:04:38] riadaich: and the lines are gonna
[6:05:00] huupzi: try double sliding doors
[6:05:37] Mr_Stevex: flip it
[6:05:38] ANTiN0VA: Can it slide in the wall?
[6:05:38] StreamElements: ANTiN0VA, no
[6:05:40] lrcifuu: test
[6:05:40] f1ywhiteguy: doubledoor all the way? what happened had to work for a sec
[6:05:46] LoneWolf_N7: yep ignore chat and design it how you want
[6:05:59] ToTheSameHeights: prison door LUL
[6:06:02] GRAYURSUSTANA: just flip it 180 degrees
[6:06:04] bridgesblike: prison bars OMEGALUL
[6:06:21] GRAYURSUSTANA: flip the left glass door 180 degrees and its a double sliding door ez

[6:06:22] StreamElements: vanzkie21, no
[6:06:28] sappyoda: can you mirror the door?

[6:07:14] DylBKR: Clipping the glass?
[6:07:27] GRAYURSUSTANA: move the doors to the wall and then align the glass with the doors
[6:07:27] DonnieRockettt: GTA Sims acieWADDLE
[6:07:29] Mr_Shadi: Maybe because of the glass panel behind ?
[6:07:32] soniclink10: Move them too meet that wall since you got the thick wall
[6:07:40] n0ux_: instead of right door maybe place glass?
[6:07:49] DonnieRockettt: You're really good at building acieHEART
[6:08:16] iHarsh29: 2 doors
[6:08:23] TimePeace49: Maybe put a Florent light in gap by door and wall

[6:08:28] xfirepop: I like 2 doors tbh
[6:08:29] MonMunn: I like this
[6:08:33] immortalbat_: double door looks nice
[6:08:37] GRAYURSUSTANA: line the doors up with the wall on the right and then line the glass up after
[6:08:39] 1iwill: This looks good
[6:08:39] iHarsh29: jason standing gives me ptsd LUL
[6:08:59] MonMunn: put something in front of it
[6:09:13] DonnieRockettt: double doors gives it a more tech vibe
[6:09:13] micas290: LUL
[6:09:15] Thunderpint: Could you do the right glass door like a pocket door? Do they go into the walls idk
[6:09:18] luis_king82: Now that I see that door, is it safe?.. chat
[6:09:23] RagnaroKPrimeTV: maybe a pillar or something
[6:09:35] Kangaroo_Balls: might as well center the doors more if your puttingglass there
[6:09:40] LamePuf: dont they stuck on the second floor
[6:09:49] LamePuf: stuck out*
[6:09:50] f1ywhiteguy: vee side hustle, interior design 10k/hour

[6:10:40] Thunderpint: Too much of it is in the wall maybe?
[6:10:44] DylBKR: Too deep oyt of bounds
[6:10:45] sappyoda: it's inside the wall
[6:10:49] DylBKR: *out
[6:10:50] GRAYURSUSTANA: put the doors against the wall instead
[6:11:06] BoJackJohnsson: Its just a bug, it will be there when you buid
[6:11:06] MonMunn: dude your doing awesome
[6:11:06] realJokoWidodo: its not if you save it
[6:11:18] gruegd: Transparent materials probably sort by object bounds, so you can't have it inside.
[6:11:28] Turlig: OMEGADANCE nunu still dead in the corner
[6:11:37] DylBKR: Move the doors central with the glass thickness maybe?
[6:11:43] luis_king82: try
[6:11:56] Pieana: Mr. President are you sure? @realjokowidodo
[6:12:03] Kangaroo_Balls: center the doors

[6:12:22] realJokoWidodo: @Pieana yes frfr on god
[6:12:27] Dano_Leza: looking so dope!!!!

[6:12:46] Hollowshaun: this is tempo editing POV
[6:12:48] nomoreheroes__: can you place a metal beam next to the sliding door?

[6:13:04] StreamElements: Mr_Shadi, no
[6:13:23] Shaekwonn: gta on pc kind of crazy
[6:13:28] BoJackJohnsson: My tip is to put the door next to the wall. Then fill the gap on the other side with glas
[6:13:28] Shaekwonn: looking like sims jk
[6:14:01] CRlCK: 6 more hours of building ACTINGUP ACTINGUP

[6:15:07] M0hkofantti: Raia Bedge
[6:15:09] venyalorelei: Small stairs to the basement
[6:15:10] Hollowshaun: is this house sound proof
[6:15:12] jas3y: probably too much quiet and standing still for raia
[6:15:14] venyalorelei: More realistic i'd say
[6:15:18] ToTheSameHeights: keep
[6:15:18] basards: are you going to hide the 3rd floor?
[6:15:18] Terrous10: Do the thicker walls block more light,
[6:15:22] ChaseBands_: different colour wall lol
[6:15:28] miniPB: she said Bedge in chat a little bit ago
[6:15:32] Hollowshaun: what about a stripper pole in the basement no stairs
[6:15:33] DylBKR: Its a while off but are you having the first floor be a balcony or filling it in?
[6:16:05] Echoskope: can you put the bottom stairs right under the top stairs?
[6:16:05] StreamElements: Echoskope, no
[6:16:06] Terrous10: shift the stairs over, and draw a wall straight down, then that can act as a secrete passageway
[6:16:09] Echoskope: slightly inset from the wall
[6:16:41] itsxNeo: Watch out. Lots of Ppl crashing Right now
[6:16:41] Echoskope: ok sorry StreamElements
