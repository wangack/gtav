[5:29:58] nikolegrnd: but they can nikkisTin

[5:30:14] filipe_vasconcellos_: NODDERS

[5:31:30] natikar: yeah thats a loophole
[5:31:31] Bruvverbean: I see Max pushing as much as he can, and delay apointing a commissioner
[5:31:47] minnmor: oh they took the active part away from it. it had active on it when they were looking it in council meeting
[5:31:55] natikar: crane will have looked this over too
[5:32:02] JoshGB_: Interesting that there is loop holes and crane wrote it lol
[5:32:02] BerryG_333: 2 months to close loops

[5:32:21] colacubes1: loop holes make it more fun
[5:32:21] Crazith: Crane loves loopholes
[5:32:22] Bruvverbean: loopholes create RP
[5:32:29] maraderi: Could he not deem 'difficult' seniors to be 'inefficient' or 'corrupt', strip them of that title, select his own senior officers, and THEN choose candidates from those few?
[5:32:36] MAZM0L: KEKW
[5:32:42] klaunns: that last sentence is for cornwood KEKW
[5:32:42] jasonarce: Crane's finger prints every were
[5:32:48] nikolegrnd: a new character incoming in the city that was senior officer in his other city LUL
[5:32:54] m3gabytez: so it would be in the best interests of the Mayor to delay selecting a Commissioner as long as possible. And create a totally different department not called LSPD so that sentence doesn't apply
[5:33:10] xXxEV0xXx: Thats just the commissioner tho.. any orders he gives can be over rode by the mayor still.. what good is only the commissioner not having to answer to the mayor?
[5:33:24] MAZM0L: @nikolegrnd baas v5 Pog
[5:33:56] frsttyyy: also there's nothing saying that he has to appoint one either does it?
[5:34:15] maraderi: In an ideal scenario for Max, he could cherry pick a commissioner who no longer has to answer to mayor AFTER Max
[5:34:22] maraderi: So pulling strings after his term
[5:34:30] klaunns: can they just never appoint a "commissioner" and instead appoint a "chief of police" and all that goes out the window
[5:34:41] Bruvverbean: RAGEY
