[2:17:55] GalovicV: yuh NODDERS
[2:17:58] PrimalGamingg: Option 2 is the better option clearly
[2:18:08] Anrisacia: No they aren't, they're actually usually very hot kivaSus

[2:36:08] coldfire772: the item needed
[2:36:22] Vizi797: That's to make the hazamat thing
[2:36:28] Vizi797: it's not an actual trashcan
[2:36:31] coldfire772: there has to be more
[2:36:43] Steambottom: @tyler4am it has the same writers
[2:36:56] tadjh_: is hei_heist_kit_bin_01 in the catalog?
[2:37:08] L_Z_RD: Could it be under waste or something?
[2:37:22] coldfire772: well if it helps at all, I believe in your ability to find it
[2:37:46] L_Z_RD: You do live with Reed now, maybe the hazmat one is needed.
[2:37:49] tadjh_: oo PauseChamp
[2:37:53] PeachTwirl: hamper?
[2:38:01] Tyler4AM: You're getting warmer
[2:38:36] nekuvtv: Just have a full park-style bin, you guys have like 20 people living here KEKW
[2:39:08] coldfire772: the red one looked bigger
[2:39:28] coldfire772: fair enough
[2:39:28] whyiamso: So far I like the hazmat bin the most lol Considering some of the heinous stuff the group produces KEKW
[2:39:41] AdamElJefe: Actually that's a good size for the size of the kitchen
[2:39:53] AdamElJefe: the taller one would've looked kinda out of place
[2:40:08] coldfire772: how do you get the material for the water in the sink anyways?
[2:40:14] Steambottom: clock?
[2:40:18] nekuvtv: You could put a Hazmat bin and put a label "Siz and Erin's bin" KEKW
[2:40:38] coldfire772: the neon ones were pretty neat
[2:40:49] AdamElJefe: I mean, if the tavern sign is in there, I almost feel like it has to be that for the nostalgia

[2:43:06] AdamElJefe: I didn't see it but the tavern had the Logger Beer neon sign out front
[2:43:07] Vizi797: You could use those to distract McNulty if he ever raids the house KEKW
[2:43:08] coldfire772: this is like treehouse/clubhouse vibe but for grownups

[2:47:31] Not_Very_Good_Pigeon: @inus2 what i saw nothing. nothing at all. just like i see the dron es that siz points out in trees and stuff.

[2:51:10] Random_Slacker: easy, just ask the neighbor for tap water.. they clearly have a kitchen
[2:51:12] Tyler4AM: What if Andi made her own water
[2:51:20] Random_Slacker: manny can fix it, haha
[2:51:28] nekuvtv: Just ask down at City Hall if you can have some tap water KEKW
[2:51:33] coldfire772: maybe it’s a snr buns thing? or a sewer thing?
[2:51:34] Dagger255: Tap water blueprint 😂
[2:51:35] squoogelol: just get a bucket and go to the ocean 4Head

[2:55:29] Jerco2020: Lol
[2:55:30] coldfire772: the lumber co can probably get a lot of the stuff too
[2:55:31] Tyler4AM: Personally I hope you have to find the job to become a firefighter and then grind that to up your fire rep so that you can unlock the fire
[2:55:36] nekuvtv: Also, how does it feel that you finally stopped getting called "construction lady" only to literally do construction for the group KEKW
[2:55:52] nekuvtv: @Tyler4AM I would unironically love this
[2:56:01] coldfire772: but maybe for things like tapwater and food stuff you hit up senor buns?
[2:56:13] Jerco2020: The hoa would be lost without you uwuWOW
[2:56:15] Tyler4AM: Sorry, the fire blueprint
[2:56:37] Vizi797: No way, those are definitely opposed, getting fire red lowers your water rep and vice versa sorry
[2:56:43] nekuvtv: No, no you get the water blueprint when you unlock working for the water treatment plant so you can make pure water after 75 steps KEKW
[2:56:44] Tyler4AM: Jeff Probst is the NPC
[2:56:44] Vizi797: fire rep*
[2:56:52] DJ_4point0: You have to find the wizard npc and learn the fire spell
[2:56:56] Jerco2020: uwuUGH
[2:56:59] coldfire772: maybe you have to create an electrical fire in your apartment for it to drop?
[2:57:11] Jerco2020: Surely
[2:57:26] Vizi797: KEKW
[2:57:31] Random_Slacker: we need an andi tap water connect arc.. stand in alleys selling sussy bottles of water
[2:57:32] Tyler4AM: Then you can make a firefighter union that is actually just a front to sell drugs and do crime
[2:57:44] Jerco2020: I will harvest this FIRE

[3:01:48] L_Z_RD: PepeLaugh
[3:01:51] Jerco2020: HORRID HORRID
[3:02:10] inus2: the different job npcs might sell some decoration stuff without a rep requirement also
[3:02:25] coldfire772: isn’t there like an electrical appliances store in the city?
[3:02:35] nekuvtv: Around 9.5K I think?
[3:02:59] AdamElJefe: peepoGiggles
[3:03:24] nekuvtv: Need emotes in the log so you can rate each transaction _/5 suffer emotes
[3:04:18] coldfire772: makes sense
[3:04:29] coldfire772: that’s like holding 10k in cash
[3:04:35] Random_Slacker: I'm assuming it won't.. but since the other npcs have housing stuff.. could weed guy have water?
[3:04:40] Random_Slacker: only npc I can think of to fit

[6:22:22] wizardiis: NODDERS
[6:22:44] lblvckmvgicl: NODDERS
[6:22:47] Thrath: Yeah just seems like a majority of the conversations are only between Erin and Siz
[6:24:13] Vizi797: I wonder if any of that's getting lost in translation a tiny bit with people. I honestly thought it was a bit "I want to be a regular member" thing even from a viewer perspective.
[6:24:15] Luroloro: ok but what does it DO?
[6:24:46] Thrath: @Vizi797 Yeah even as a viewer I think it got lost in translation and I wonder if Siz got the same feeling KEKW
[6:25:27] DevilsFeline: ^same
[6:25:50] Luroloro: maybe its maybelline
[6:25:52] Ashtahh: Yeah when you say not leading I assumed no high command position
[6:26:23] imdeatht1: I think it comes across pretty well it was just the early part of 4.0 when andi got called literally every 10 minutes while she was trying to lumber
[6:26:40] Thrath: Its something I noticed in the Siz conversations but when the talk with Pilbis happened it became apparent that she is still struggling not being a leader
[6:26:41] DevilsFeline: It might be something that needs brought up since placements have not really been talked about
[6:27:32] mvrk_7: idek if siz looks at himself as the main guy anymore even if everyone says so, and is thinking all the leaders of each lane would hold a equal leader ship role. just from my viewer perspective
[6:27:36] zeman94: Idk I thought the same as kiva because andis brought in for major choices but minor choices siz and Erin seem to handle
[6:27:49] Ashtahh: Yeah I think a “high command” meeting should take place (Siz & Ant) for structure
[6:28:02] Vizi797: You've absolutely said that about liking to be number 2. I think Andi yelling I don't want to lead is just the louder easier to parse sentiment
[6:28:21] Ashtahh: but the pod thing should have helped but idk if it has
[6:28:21] Thrath: @Vizi797 ^Probably this more than anything KEKW
[6:29:27] Jerco2020: Once that 50 goal is met I think everyone can chill a bit

[6:31:07] zeman94: I think ant and siz will always be seen as the leader because if either one went away a lot of people wouldn't wake up
[6:32:08] aconfused_melon: that’s what happens when your in the middle of the rung. especially when Andi constantly says she doesn’t want leadership SHRUGGERS
[6:32:41] wizardiis: I think Erin spends a lot more time around Siz than Andi ever did, idk if thats relevant at all
[6:32:49] DevilsFeline: a lot of people seem confused on the structure of the group since it wasn’t really said besides Siz leader. yeah the pod leader thing was said but I also think people are confused with it too because seems weed crew thinks they have to do everything theirselves without the rest for their pod. which seems weird because they should ask for help if needed especially when it comes to costs of stuff and shouldn’t feel they have to pay back other pods for helping
[6:33:00] aconfused_melon: CHATTING
[6:33:35] DevilsFeline: I meant with not without stupid auto correct
[6:34:05] Vizi797: Once the house is done, and Andi can focus more on being involved in other things, I could see it picking back up again. I don't see the older members not still thinking of her as in charge still
[6:34:15] Not_Very_Good_Pigeon: I see Andi as like CEO. she doesn't need to do the day to day running of the business, but Erin does go to Andi when she's struggling and they have the little sit down on the floor meetings in the middle of the house when no one else is around.
[6:35:44] aconfused_melon: Andi is on the same level as Nico and Stanley now, valuable assets Okayge
[6:35:55] Thrath: Yeah I suppose thats maybe more of where I was going with it is more if Andi feels like her purpose diminishes when she is not considered "leadership" anymroe
[6:35:59] RadahTatTat: overall it seems like the rest of the group don't wanna bother ant or overload her with their problems (like before)
[6:36:26] aconfused_melon: monkaW human interaction
[6:36:51] sage40k: the lingering scent of reed
[6:38:37] Bigfredstallbeer: There's just so much that changes daily.
