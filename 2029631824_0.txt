No Idea if Spaceboy plans to do some ‚Äúdark‚Äù James Randal Arc or some other 200IQ stuff.  I might be picking this up wrong aswell but it also feels like the other RPers are getting tired of James violence. Anyways I didn‚Äôt enjoy James today. Let‚Äôs see where it‚Äôs going.

[4:33:59] Brisk_Avocado: seems like it can only get you somewhere walkable
[4:33:59] TravisWhasUp: 1st person when emote cancel?
[4:34:03] HellsMaximum: place 1 then your second and you might be able to be teleported to where the first one is
[4:34:04] JonEFive: James' problem of the day: "When I get to a place, how do I stay where I am?"

[4:34:34] joeeviljr: @brisk_avocado nah Carter was saying earlier that he could get on the roof of the apartments with it
[4:34:40] NexulSejuct: What might be happening is it only teleports you to a place you can reach. From how it looks it auto-walks you to a location. And if you can't reach that location, it won't complete the teleport. But instead reach the spot where the auto-walk ends?
[4:34:41] butterdoge_: Almost there
