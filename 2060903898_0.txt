[2:01:06] Rool_Gonzalez: chance to figure out WHY those are named so is tricky too
[2:01:08] normalbnt: How often does the mayor change?
[2:01:19] SpilledNuts: @normalbnt 3 month terms
[2:01:26] SpilledNuts: The can run for more then one term if they want

[2:05:03] Udeadman: She will be back later
[2:05:21] SpilledNuts: if you can get the 1200~ a batch, with 4 going every 45 mins. Thats 4800 an hour. Assuming you can keep up with material demand, and get the bottles delivered in that time
[2:05:39] TropicalToucan: Doing a big run would be big money but also just a headache because 40 separate bottles LULW

[2:07:28] FLASHPOINTSS: FLASHPOINTSS subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! yo
[2:07:49] thegavinator3000: It would take 250 cooks of running 4 stills to try just 1% of the all possible combinations. If my math is right.
[2:08:01] jayfwe: @tropicaltoucan that’s fine for selling, but not for growing Scooby dooby
[2:08:16] TropicalToucan: @jayfwe I didnt realize that was a part of the deal

[2:11:19] pootie2goood: Quality and Proof
[2:11:59] FiniteResources: could it depend on sewer rep too?
[2:12:00] SpilledNuts: the sale price seems like a better metric until you're trying to really fine tune it. Like using money as a general metric, and then unbox when you want to fine tune it more
[2:12:02] sid9002: This is the closest we get to meth
[2:12:08] rayhxxn: What if you let it ferment for longer?
[2:12:09] Genoide: Could rep affect quality?

[2:12:57] hate_antichrist: gotta nail that recipe, really liking the moonshine mechanic
[2:13:00] watermelontoboggan: Are you only changing one or two variables? That might be why they're all coarse
[2:13:38] c000ls: would unpacking give you more details to help you make it better?
[2:13:57] BigPipin: Are you noting the recipies you have tried
[2:14:07] ImKBAR: Yes
[2:14:20] SpilledNuts: I don't think unpacking makes sense until you get a box that sells well anyway, if it's selll for shit like $500 total no reason to unpack

[4:55:09] CuppaT_XYZ: @mCerti ReallyMad
[4:55:21] ThePepperPeople: there is a documentary called moonshiners that might help you.

[4:56:19] searlesbarkleyk: make alcohol
[4:56:21] harkolly: No way isit that in depth to be chemically orientated.... The devs cooked if so 🔥🔥🔥🔥
[4:56:21] ThePepperPeople: yeah moonshiners is not a documentary it’s a reality tv show with toothless guys
[4:56:23] EhnOhSee: remember you got a doc with all the elements
[4:56:27] tahoemac: @scotty2thotty18 yeah but the vc is what they vented to keep it form exploding

[4:57:43] harkolly: Mg
[4:57:44] unclefester1112: I love resin
[4:57:45] CuppaT_XYZ: @cliotop from being too acidic he said
[4:57:45] Aumilly: but one or the other is maganese
[4:57:48] x_____________________d: Mm Dentge
[4:57:49] searlesbarkleyk: mg is prolly manganese

[4:59:06] fender2k1: lol
[4:59:09] CuppaT_XYZ: high sounds bad unless you got something alkalotic to balance it out
[4:59:09] mCerti: Hear that Cuppa? Being high is bad
[4:59:10] Aumilly: I’d leave out any Rare Earth metals

[5:04:19] Kxem: harry bout to have the FBI knocking on his door looking up these compounds
[5:04:20] Oni_mara: Dentge ya
[5:04:24] TheBrownStreak1: has anyone tried drinking their own product?
[5:04:25] mCerti: @searlesbarkleyk so then there is no hope LUL i started when I was 16
[5:04:26] SekretAznMan: Nerdge
[5:04:33] TropicalToucan: LUL I think you are over thinking this LUL
[5:04:42] searlesbarkleyk: @mCerti nah, there's hope. Probably takes a ton of practice.
[5:04:48] mCerti: True
[5:05:20] searlesbarkleyk: @mCerti Preferably practice with people that don't have the same accent :P
[5:05:20] Oni_mara: Bro(mine)
[5:05:31] tahoemac: iits reverse bromine, it gives life instead of poison
[5:05:31] DoctorLAW590: The idea might be to maximize alcohol content, so trying to get ethanol, acetone, isopropanol, methanol, and ethylene glycol
[5:05:35] armzie33HD: rB IS Rubidium
[5:05:39] fender2k1: chemistry was one of the few things i enjoyed in school. I wish i learned more
[5:05:40] UnearthedSin: Rubidium bromide (RbBr)
[5:05:42] Frozencurse: what is harry doing to that jug?????
[5:05:44] g0m3rrrr: reverse it though? the capital is the start of the acronym. tricky
[5:06:02] KrisCat: @mCerti watch a lot of soap operas lol
[5:06:03] normalbnt: @Frozencurse If you gotta ask, you can't afford it
[5:06:04] searlesbarkleyk: @DoctorLAW590 but methanol will make you blind :P
[5:06:04] GaiGenX: Yeah, Br is Bromine
[5:06:19] goodtimes54: its tricky cause mixing these thing could change the chemical  structure and make them safe. Imagine you need all the dangerous ones lol

[5:07:04] PteradactylJones: wow they made shine makin so complicated
[5:07:13] GaiGenX: Maybe it coats the parts?
[5:07:13] cinav_: how is your search history looking, first drying weed and now moonshine LUL
[5:07:23] PaganHeart: No idea here, but I think maybe it could be instead of removing certain ones, maybe it's a balancing act? So have a few pH basic chems with a strong acid but it then neutralizes the acid some with like two additives or something?
[5:07:27] JJqqz: @cinav_ FBI Be knocking soon
[5:07:42] Oni_mara: Cooking
[5:07:50] PaganHeart: Probably not, to be honest, but that would be an interesting system, or way of them making it
[5:08:15] mCerti: Imagine Harry was signed into Clarissa's chrome account while doing this research
[5:08:19] GaiGenX: lol
[5:08:21] searlesbarkleyk: It could all just be randomized based on your unique player ID as the seed :P
[5:08:22] KrisCat: @mCerti the young and the restless too lol
[5:08:24] CocaColaAddicted: that's the one
[5:08:24] yahmobethere: i was always wondering if like 5 of the things were bad and 5 were good and you had to figure out which to not use

[5:08:35] m0hx000: LUL LUL LUL
[5:08:37] spudd710: sounds perfect for moonshine lmao

[5:10:03] CocaColaAddicted: you are mixing chems so it won't hold all it's things
[5:10:06] searlesbarkleyk: always gotta love VD
[5:10:10] wildturkeyno9: @tahoemac SeemsGood
[5:10:11] PaganHeart: @badbrainsss I honestly won't be surprised if the meth system ends up having some recipe component of it like this, along with the task sequencing aspects of previous seasons
[5:10:15] OriginalGibsta: You can also repeat like Hu Vd Hu
[5:10:19] Frozencurse: its going to blow isnt it?

[5:10:49] tahoemac: @fublian probably
[5:10:49] dogma4202112: When combining certain elements become a compound. Like salt NaCl has chloride which is poison but when reacted in a compound becomes table salt.
[5:10:52] mCerti: research *
[5:10:53] searlesbarkleyk: "research" lol
[5:11:02] violon3: double something?
[5:11:04] fublian: I guess it is easy to just do two batches, with same ingredents and just different order to see if they are the same
[5:11:06] pootie2goood: Change clothes fof promotion of teddy lol
[5:11:07] EhnOhSee: imagine 1 blows up and you get a chain reaction on all the others

[5:11:29] yahmobethere: even more complicated to think that maybe you only use 2-3 of the 10 too. lot of work
[5:11:29] ImKBAR: @goodtimes54 it is actually cooking
[5:11:52] tahoemac: can you take the course booze and refine it?

[6:19:26] TropicalToucan: Its always a weird conversation when I have to explain I want improv soap operas in modded GTA LUL
[6:19:47] mnfoxtrot: Can moonshine be used as an ingredient?
