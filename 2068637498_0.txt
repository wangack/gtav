[4:18:12] doc_sharon: I liked all of Rue's explanations for her answers Yesyes
[4:18:29] Crafty_Crystal: Maxx is giving SAA vibes with this talk. In that it’s more broadly managing people instead of a project manager (like Road Captain).
[4:18:35] itsjustasummerjob: when I'm right I'm right
[4:18:42] laxwall11: and we are going to keep working on that driving

[4:25:19] ImTooOldForThisShit: @a_humble_wooper  ooh hell ya, any specific traits to the role?
[4:26:30] itsjustasummerjob: Enforcer is an extension of our SaA - it really depends on Wade or whoever the SaA ends up being in the future to determine what her role is in relation to RC
[4:26:47] doc_sharon: Clap good talk
