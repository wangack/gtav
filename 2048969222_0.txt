[1:07:41] svea7: you give gold and then pick up cash
[1:07:48] J_Harris18: Given a car, u drive straight to money bags. bags had the cash
[1:07:48] Vibezyyyyy: yeah it was similar to this
[1:07:54] svea7: but you get clean money
[1:07:55] Malding_Beta: they did runs in a flagged car and had to pick up bags
[1:07:55] benreed9: 10 drop offs with 50k at each spot in a flagged vehicle
[1:08:02] Vibezyyyyy: but the car was the same with random colour and shit
[1:08:23] svea7: and it was clean
[1:08:23] DanielleG__: npc sold all the other stuff right chat?
[1:08:28] svea7: you could do more
[1:08:35] Vibezyyyyy: the drop offs depended on how much money they would ask to clean
[1:08:38] honbry: custom amounts
[1:08:43] svea7: you could to millions worth runs
[1:08:51] stnash52: I mean when you got 30mil+ to get through 500k isn‚Äôt that much
[1:08:54] svea7: do*
[1:08:58] LutonBoi420: @danielleg__ yhh I think
[1:08:58] pinchxr777: Angels ooc got bored of doing it
[1:09:01] JasmineDeniza: they were just done with it I guess
[1:09:03] brosk1997: you could do more but each pic up was only 50k
[1:09:08] oskarrr7: but it took TIME to do
[1:09:10] warmachine2o: It takes a lot of time
[1:09:12] svea7: yeah they were bored
[1:09:16] Vibezyyyyy: it was just risky and took a lot of time
[1:09:24] k3z123: yh but they also got caught and lost millions
[1:09:35] Vibezyyyyy: its more then 10 drops
[1:09:39] Vibezyyyyy: it custom amounts
[1:09:49] Vibezyyyyy: depending on how much you clean
[1:09:52] pinchxr777: It's as many as they could do Antonio did a 2 million run and it took 4 hours
[1:09:53] svea7: depending on amount of gold is the amount of drops
[1:09:59] warmachine2o: No it's more money more drops...
[1:10:14] gkcrew: they were lazy let's keep it real now
[1:10:27] warmachine2o: If i remember it was like 50 or some drops it they do 2milli runs
[1:10:30] svea7: you get burned out
[1:10:32] stnash52: 1
[1:10:33] svea7: they weren‚Äôt lazy
[1:10:37] kevin_2k0317: how did u get that cqr
[1:10:42] JasmineDeniza: they also could have trusted someone to do it not just angels if it was too much but yeah
[1:10:53] o8j8m: Beans
[1:10:58] Vibezyyyyy: @gkcrew yes they were but its also easy to be burnt out from a process like that
[1:10:59] mfammoney: wait what are these new jobs you are doing?
[1:11:08] LutonBoi420: Beans Beans Beans
[1:11:31] mfammoney: how did you get put onto the pawnshop guy?
[1:11:48] LutonSucks8137: @mfammoney through the fence guy
[1:12:18] mfammoney: oh damn so the fence guy put you on to it, that‚Äôs dope
[1:12:28] kevin_2k0317: Matt so ur basically doing chopping rep fence rep and pawn rep?
[1:13:08] ignia15: could check with someone
[1:13:16] ignia15: if they have access
[1:13:33] gkcrew: someone else other than you should be doing the runs if you're chopping
[1:13:38] stnash52: I‚Äôm guessing there will be at some point
[1:13:46] ItsRazzer_: it‚Äôs new so it‚Äôs probably scuffed
[1:13:56] ItsRazzer_: cuz it probably should
[1:14:27] shaynedaws0ne: Matt you still going through with the metro business
[1:14:27] brosk1997: the rep probably unlocks something so they got it turned of for now
[1:14:27] DanielleG__: VIBE
[1:14:29] ignia15: real question is will it mess with your fence rep
[1:14:59] MerkzzMF: It makes sense for them 3 reps to work together tbh
[1:15:00] ItsRazzer_: y would it do that
[1:15:33] stnash52: more money tho
[1:15:39] DonRager: yup

[1:15:58] neasty_keai: still good long run, god nows how banks pay will work
[1:16:00] ignia15: yea but you dont have to do it no? Could get someone else on it
[1:16:08] stnash52: a lot more
[1:16:10] MerkzzMF: If it was easy thou it would be abused so making it harder is understandable
[1:16:13] ItsRazzer_: it‚Äôs 6x the amount from before
[1:16:19] ItsRazzer_: u have been told
[1:16:22] djsanto: crime pays way less

[1:29:51] stnash52: I thought he was a lawyer
[1:29:51] JasmineDeniza: all cops got told to do new characters basically
