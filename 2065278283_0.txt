[9:17:17] psicosmoker1979: but the pixel money
[9:17:29] Beevis: yeah if suarez doesnt pay time to repossess it
[9:17:55] maharanghi: Chas is like the hydra bank sntKEK
[9:17:59] xdSilly: 5Head  take a loan to pay ur loan ezz
[9:18:02] RoyLeeTV: g6 and cop is a great combo

[9:19:34] MdAbdi: You should put interest on the agreement, if he doesn't pay in time etc. Just as banks do it with loans
[9:19:47] Zomedha: @Zomedha ur lucky i gambled all my points
[9:20:18] Maxverine: @Zomedha Do you want a loan? KEKW
[9:20:39] petterseff: my guy
[9:20:53] dirtyboyz09: does the atm make more than 5k a week?
[9:21:22] milkydeew: @dirtyboyz09 it makes 1-3k a day
[9:21:23] HEGGA: I just love the fact that flippy would have something over suarez
[9:21:24] Estimationed: 8k a week for 10 weeks may be better
[9:21:24] petterseff: Aloo
[9:21:28] lestermatthew: just want to create new RP i got you
[9:21:33] kiri_nz: He's prepping for future potential bank payments
[9:21:34] Zomedha: @Zomedha hahahaha its ok
[9:22:13] petterseff: @dirtyboyz09 in that case its horrible to make the deal
[9:23:13] Not_Very_Good_Pigeon: He needs to be able to make a profit though while paying you.
[9:23:18] psicosmoker1979: with that conditions you can milk JJ
[9:23:21] Jimmy_G24: the atm basically makes a payment everyday
[9:23:41] jrod91782: would you make more per week if you shared with Jason?
[9:23:44] petterseff: brokeAF
[9:23:48] lestermatthew: it is new RP but at the same time the ATM makes you more passive income so there is a rock and a hard place you got to get out of
[9:23:51] Maxverine: CatsJAM
[9:23:52] AetherMana: What about a 1-2% of the ATM for 20 weeks instead of 90K flat out
[9:23:53] josaaa99: ello NRGFlippy
[9:23:53] dirtyboyz09: i think you should say ok to payments but you get half the [rpfit  till he owns it so he will want to pay it off quicker?
[9:23:54] Not_Very_Good_Pigeon: otherwise it's not worth it because months is a long time the otherway to. he needs to wait months to make a profit?
[9:23:54] Markzyy: could also incentivise him to pay it to you sooner by adding a % profits paid in addition to weekly payment whilst their is still money to be paid. Like a royalty until you get your money
[9:23:59] SlyDolphin: lookUp damn
[9:24:00] MrsReaperShadow: and if liam or chas get a felony your atm is gone anyway with no compensation

[9:24:14] shanef8: @silent Don't think it worth with 20 weeks.. maybee like 10 week will be alot better
[9:24:40] milkydeew: @Not_Very_Good_Pigeon No he doesn't, its business to start a business your debt at the start then you make profit after
[9:24:45] josaaa99: @Maxverine gotta mix it up KEKW
[9:24:45] boneruler: 85k - 10 weeks
[9:24:55] HEGGA: The only thing for me is the 20 weeks, long ass time
[9:25:20] AetherMana: Dont do a flat number, Do it based on the income of the ATM. Make him pay you 2% for 12-16 weeks
[9:25:37] milkydeew: @AetherMana Its hard to control that process
[9:25:58] Estimationed: Initial payment upfront and then what's left over 10 weeks or something
[9:26:21] saintjean77: 8K for the 20 weeks. Or 10K for 10 weeks you should counter
[9:26:24] AetherMana: how is it hard? theres stats how much a ATM makes on the G6 app
[9:26:28] Not_Very_Good_Pigeon: @milkydeew would you make the deal if you are buying the atm?

[9:28:26] RKO6301221: 4.2k a week isn't really worth
