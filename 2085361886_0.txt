[6:12:42] hexadx: @Ming So basically how this works is so all the blocks go straight downwards whenever the blocks are taken from below it and the best way to do it is to avoid colors end up like a chessboard
[6:12:43] gunblade00: since they move to the bottom left shouldent you start with top right corner.

[6:13:12] javy0909: 4head always starts from top right i observed
