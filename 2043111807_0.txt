[3:17:26] 911_raj: Early weed runs payed off
[3:17:43] vosabine: idk if you knows this but the lag is happening because the item limit is 180 items per room, you can set rooms in the decorating system
[3:17:46] quadity2: You need to utilize the "make room" function
[3:17:50] Jammie3d: happens to Larry all the time
[3:17:51] senlash: trav probably has a better computer Sadding
[3:17:53] bearscarlight: buddha and ray c was talking about it yesterday, something about designing houses with rooms

[3:18:17] gearofnett: Marty’s house also has this problem for pretty much everyone
[3:18:21] quadity2: Every room with a door should be seperated buddha said
[3:18:23] Mavmar: buddha said rooms were going to be huge for people optimizing things
[3:18:48] vosabine: for rooms you need to enclose the entire room with walls and i think use a door + doorframe? buddha said the rooom will look empty/unloaded/scuffy otherwise
[3:18:56] CmdrPain: Ngl, I really want a Single player game like this. Weedshop 3 was okay. But this seem more involved.
[3:19:09] senlash: BOOMIES

[3:20:01] bluoxxboi: @cmdrpain juice it up LUL
[3:20:22] manfreygordon: I think you also need to manually assign all the items in the room
[3:20:38] BotDoris: he does his voice please
[3:20:40] Brodoswagings: think you then need to put all those items in that room in right map or something i heard someone talk about that yesterday
[3:21:03] scha_de: Void room is the room that loads when youre in the vicinity outside
[3:21:09] scha_de: hence "entrance"
[3:21:11] kiss_me_noob: yeah in a folder
[3:21:29] Brodoswagings: like the room becomes a folder where you put all those items thats inside that room in
[3:21:35] 911_raj: Somebody send him the clip
[3:21:36] Brodoswagings: hwo you do that i dont know
[3:21:42] senlash: RPDirector
[3:21:44] vosabine: havent seen anyone do this so idk
[3:22:02] manfreygordon: I think you drag the items into the room in the list
[3:22:03] scha_de: drag objects "on" the room in the list maybe?
[3:22:08] 0Bahadar0: drag and drop
[3:22:08] amorton15: Nidas loves his dollhouse RP

[3:23:23] Dentvis: EZWink
[3:23:25] ikrstfu: EZ
[3:23:28] Brodoswagings: EZ
[3:24:18] vosabine: can you shift click multiple items?
[3:24:47] vosabine: yes room need to be entirely closed off i think
[3:24:57] scha_de: the items load once you enter a linked room
[3:24:58] 0Bahadar0: yep just loading
[3:25:01] Xpatrol: Maybe dont load item until u enter the room
[3:25:01] vosabine: otherwise the room looks empty
[3:25:11] scha_de: I mean it also helps once you got 300 items in the house
