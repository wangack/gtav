[2:47:39] xcrash283x: @drpeppertaco lol have you even seen his reports XD
[2:47:44] churbs: Maybe they want to give dispatch RP too. It makes more sense for them to be taking calls than a cop @uberhaxornova
[2:47:44] The2b: I just don't know why they wouldn't put in a whitelist if they didn't want lower ranks using it
[2:47:44] buddha_hands: I would imagine because people would abuse the shit out of people calling in for laughs, or overly respond to those calls & not others.. no clue

[2:48:03] CinnamonHipster: Yeah bc the only thing complained about was the notification sound, not having to respond to 911's in general?
[2:48:07] siixxer: i like oreos anyone else
[2:48:10] fvo__: Just get through solo and then figure wtv you wanna do with 911 etc. obviously some people just don’t give a shit about 911 and just wanna go to chase and that’s fine too. you can apply the same to real life education

[2:49:21] toadloadmodechode: @queentier i actually never liked pacman PepeLaugh
[2:49:22] MizRinDisco: ya so basically proving your pint that higher-ups will ignore it more than you would
[2:49:23] BolbiBaggins: @Sleeplessbard he was already yelling prior to chat KEKW
[2:49:23] Zoopn: You'd figure Cadets and low ranks would be prime for taking 911's considering they're pretty much just "Hey do this" dummies.
[2:49:25] UEL_sam: If you ask high command for permission they probably will give it to you
[2:49:27] ProfessionalSlacker__: chat think they know how the server works better than people who actually playing it KEKW
[2:49:28] mnk_tropic: how is everybody doing this morning?
[2:49:30] Cross0utlaw: @ftgneobeast the main point if rp for dispatch that has no chance to talk to the rest of the city. they are stuck at mrpd
[2:49:34] CensoredTH0ughTs: I know angel told a cadet that asked these same questions to become a dispatcher LUL

[2:49:43] FallingFan: @toadloadmodechode JamesPog just gotta go hard on memorizing those formulas then KEKW or just get em tattooed on your fingies
[2:49:44] Chengaling: in all honesty it don't make sense so they will probably change it like they change everything
[2:49:48] TheMooMooCow: @churbs the point is that both could do it due to the lack of dispatchers...
[2:49:51] Sleeplessbard: James got booming voice
[2:49:56] Sleeplessbard: any nodders
[2:50:00] Lickmysaltypeanut: @KingPresiden Sadge didn't BLDRS have a parking attendant character?
[2:50:02] daveisghost: I come in and  chat is already making James angry.
[2:50:03] Brennanan: NOPERS
[2:50:05] tombovard: My guess is they don't want to risk people taking away that RP from the dispatchers since it's all they do. So limiting it to the high command is just a way to have a small amount of spillover for the calls dispatch can't answer themselves, since there are a small number of HC who are people who could be trusted to not hog the calls and actually have the authority to direct other units to said calls.  @UberHaxorNova
[2:50:06] fotdaymon: watch to change it again LOL
