[0:05:25] Canadianbloke87: buried alive would suck
[0:05:28] bagool1: TD season 4 was ass
[0:05:40] kaovnashi: @sonoma131 freezing to death would be my ideal way tbh
[0:05:40] Amazon455: Volcano what are you a villain?
[0:05:41] SpaceSquidElder: Pompei

[0:06:46] Gin_no_Tamashii: wudder
[0:06:47] LeftyyOK: @kyle was the trick, getting groceries?
[0:06:50] tiryanos: Just jump of the surface of the water, EZ
[0:06:53] anextremeemo: divers drop something first
[0:06:54] TwingNotTwang: That's why cliff divers throw a rock first
[0:06:55] audiyomind: kyleisNotes
[0:07:01] ezeref_27: Some dude working on the golden gate bridge survived cause his hammer hit the water before he did @Kyle
[0:07:06] digital_prince: i spent over 9 hours playing Supermarket Simulator last night. spent more time on a fake job than my real job
[0:07:09] KFWA: Thats why falling off a cliff u throw ur shoe or something down hard
[0:07:11] TheNachoManRandyCabbage: there is a documentary on the suicide rate at the san fran bridge
[0:07:12] Amazon455: sounds like cult stuff
[0:07:14] tiryanos: monkaW
[0:07:15] bulletmonkey85: That's why pools have a stream of water going on them next to like high dive spots so the divers don't get hurt hitting the water
[0:07:16] ADHDjay: off
[0:07:18] kaovnashi: I'd imagine whatever hits first in a volcano you wouldn't feel before you go honestly. I don't think your brain would even process the pain
[0:07:18] ADHDjay: oof*
[0:07:35] Moephor: wudder is softer than water

[0:08:38] CaptainFtard12: that isn't why they drop a rock, that doesn't break the surface tension, its soo its easier to judge the distance to the surface of the water
