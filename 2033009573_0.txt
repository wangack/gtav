[0:23:53] chrissydoll1792: Everything that I hear is for optimal viewing a 32 really doesn't have any benefits over a 27 other than surface area
[0:23:56] Raiders_1911: are you going for 4K?
[0:24:10] nocontrast: yeah i divide up the screen into sections

[7:54:01] almondmilkwithice: im mean gta was already huge NODDERS
[7:54:04] CamVsGame: lol i remember the a3l spam
[7:54:14] Diplomatics: A3L LUL
[7:54:14] AbeFroman2: lirik and summit really changed the game
[7:54:17] TheYoungHov: Saw your episode on zolos Podcast. It was awesome. Big fan
[7:54:18] CamVsGame: i loved those days
[7:54:21] almondmilkwithice: adding RP made gta Goated
[7:54:21] CamVsGame: jony the horse
[7:54:28] toesly: RP has kept this game alive
[7:54:28] Diplomatics: yesss
[7:54:57] AbeFroman2: imagine a RP BR game
[7:54:58] dezalbos: Gta 6 will be the first NODDERS
[7:55:05] toesly: theres no shot Rockstar isnt developing GTA6 with RP in mind
[7:55:05] witbull09: and Summit can be given a lot of credit for looter shooters
[7:55:09] Tremic: you'd have to compete with something the scale of GTA
[7:55:18] witbull09: atleast popularity
[7:55:30] toesly: fair
[7:55:35] stinkybilly02: @theyounghov Actually just finished watching the zolo podcast. Many things i didnt knew :)
[7:55:36] kingshwing: I don't really trust a big game company would do a good job with tht
[7:55:41] ThePlatinumMeta: belated pc release moon2PAIN
[7:55:57] AbeFroman2: i wonder if they will have fiveM work on the RP
[7:55:59] GwnYor: They HAVE to integrate RP tbh, especially since they took over cfx..
[7:56:00] AbeFroman2: surely
[7:56:03] almondmilkwithice: @Timmac did u know GTA 6 made TPain stop playing RP cause his album is in  their game and then they end up aquiring cfx
[7:56:08] Yonz: i feel like rockstar have power over servers to add ingame item into RP server to make money
[7:56:09] CamVsGame: yep
[7:56:14] witbull09: that could be just money now thing
[7:56:18] Sneaky2x: I mean, the engine already does a bunch, if they keep functionality but clean new code for the next RAGE version (gta 6), it will have for sure RP stuff in it
[7:56:21] chadford75: Gta6 Rp probably still a few years away
[7:56:23] SPxTDG: you think they would bring them in to polish?
[7:56:23] CamVsGame: its going to be a year for pc, then years for 6m
[7:56:33] witbull09: hell no its DLC baby
[7:56:34] TheDeathExperience: 2025 no?
[7:56:37] I3itches: there wont be a PC release till at least year after it comes out on console
[7:56:37] theogbigg: wont be on pc till like a year after
[7:56:42] AbeFroman2: i think it would be dumb for them to not have RP from the start
[7:56:44] MartLz: yep
[7:56:49] AbeFroman2: too much money loss
[7:56:50] dezalbos: @ThePlatinumMeta KEKLEO Steam put RDR2 as labor of love award to suck up in hopes they'd add it sooner
[7:57:09] xshagwagonx: exactly can co develop at the same time
[7:57:10] Funami: it will come with pc gta 6 i think
[7:57:14] Diplomatics: Either way, it's a win win..
[7:57:19] StaticZapper: I don't either tbh
[7:57:22] Doowy: no fucking way agree
[7:57:32] HexaDroid: incoming RP shark cards
[7:57:35] xshagwagonx: co develop with in house tools too gonna be nice
[7:57:38] PimplyBunz: swiftUh
[7:57:38] toesly: these are people who stand on a legacy of making GREAT games
[7:57:39] witbull09: intregration doesnt make as much, can be sold seperately
[7:57:42] toesly: they arent going to fuck around
[7:57:53] AbeFroman2: well with how good this RP is going, i can see them waiting to flesh out the RP, they have a fallback
[7:57:55] igod0210: did gomer buy a new car?
[7:57:58] Football97: i just wished they did more with rdr2. it had so much potential
[7:57:59] ChangaloaCartel: Then integrating would mean admitting someone did online better than them and I don't see them doing that either
[7:58:05] Sonicfear: Gta6 rp is prolly 2029,2030.
[7:58:08] almondmilkwithice: https://m.twitch.tv/tpain/clip/ZanyEnthusiasticUdonPhilosoraptor-y9P9cIEAyOjXB-je this is funny
[7:58:14] Diplomatics: wtf?
[7:58:18] MartLz: they main thing they want to do right now is make a great single player exp
[7:58:18] DeityDpills: Jesus
[7:58:19] badvies: HeyGuys
[7:58:21] MartLz: i think
[7:58:21] witbull09: truth
[7:58:22] PimplyBunz: it doesnt matter they will make bank
[7:58:31] MartLz: the
[7:58:42] PimplyBunz: no matter what they do it will make ubermoney

[7:59:01] MartLz: im thinking they want to make a campaign thats multiplayer
[7:59:02] kingshwing: sticker price is not the rockstar way
[7:59:04] Civrock: If it can be milked as a recurring charge, they will.
[7:59:09] witbull09: RP bucks
[7:59:12] Madao_69: good idea on paper but hard to apply
[7:59:12] Sneaky2x: but RP can only be good if it's free to develop, which is the case of FiveM
[7:59:18] ChangaloaCartel: Then integrating would mean admitting someone did online better than them and I don't see them doing that either
[7:59:19] I3itches: I bet they make it a subscription for 5m one drop for the game itself
[7:59:21] Madao_69: you can't monitor random people
[7:59:24] toesly: rockstar always lets us make mods
[7:59:26] toesly: always
[7:59:27] Civrock: RP Season Pass timmacM
[7:59:38] penstemon_: I can already see them making GTA6 RP full of pay2win suff
[7:59:43] AbeFroman2: like a MMO basically
[8:00:00] sychotixx: Nothing wrong with paying for it, assuming its properly supported
[8:00:02] wilrawr: nopixel shark cards is my concern lmao
[8:00:12] Diplomatics: My worry is how they implement RP; If they try to make "shark cards" into RP then it's going to ruin everything about 5m/6m.
[8:00:17] toesly: "Public RP servers" could bring a lot of people in
[8:00:21] Sneaky2x: no sub bases anymore, the market is saturated
[8:00:22] I3itches: I payed for 2 EQ subscriptions for 8 years so i would pay it probably
[8:00:24] AbeFroman2: they know the public is up in arms past few years over mtx and lootboxes but
[8:00:30] AndrewM_Burga: yep
[8:00:38] solifericat: cant wait for that mall stuff to be a part of gta6 even as an easter egg
[8:00:38] witbull09: they could achieve second life status
[8:00:41] alwaysthefriend_: Like not scuffed
[8:00:49] MartLz: i think everyone is forgetting rockstar is known for there single player games
[8:00:51] alwaysthefriend_: And no tsunamis
[8:00:57] Doowy: i think they'll just let fivem work on it, and help them on that part
[8:00:59] beasty2k21: @witbull09 SL is dead no ?
[8:00:59] toesly: yep. private security jobs. scuba diving fishing jobs. all kinds of cool shit
[8:01:00] AndrewM_Burga: lets not get too crazy @wilrawr LUL
[8:01:01] Thelazyplayer: they could but they have zero track record for that BUT they have a huge chance to change everything
[8:01:08] kingshwing: on the dev side they could do some crazy shit. i just worry about them being under the corporate umbrella
[8:01:08] Azhogh: What about gta online?
[8:01:13] Numark420: sup gomer
[8:01:17] ChangaloaCartel: I don't see them making things better because if that was the case GTA online would've already been competitive to 5m
[8:01:19] Numark420: timmacDANCE timmacDANCE
[8:01:19] RatherBeInside: they will still have the normal multiplayer servers to monetize, I'm sure they understand how that would ruin the "rp" of the servers
[8:01:20] AbeFroman2: yep RP is is their bread and butter
[8:01:21] toesly: shark cards and RP
[8:01:21] Sneaky2x: Of course they know
[8:01:21] Azhogh: Or RDR online, they're not exclusive to single player
[8:01:22] Doowy: gta online is a thing aswell
[8:01:26] almondmilkwithice: true
[8:01:27] Thelazyplayer: i believe that as well @Timmac
[8:01:28] Numark420: yes
[8:01:28] CamVsGame: gta online carried it alongside rp
[8:01:30] NugsZA: i bought gta for RP servers
[8:01:32] BiGGHydro: It's the reason why it's not out yet
[8:01:36] Numark420: gta would have been in the dustbin
[8:01:39] 404alpaca: gta online was good at launch then it became shitshow
[8:01:45] Football97: does anyone actually play gta online
[8:01:47] NugsZA: I never played the story online
[8:01:48] toesly: 6 years
[8:01:48] MartLz: true but look at the progress in rdr2
[8:01:52] PimplyBunz: 10 years
[8:01:53] ThePlatinumMeta: 10+ years
[8:01:56] Civrock: With officially supported servers, what kind of player count could GTA 6 have?
[8:01:56] penstemon_: since 2018
[8:01:58] Thelazyplayer: 4 years easily, probably 6
[8:01:59] CamVsGame: people still play GTA online
[8:02:00] djene: Yeah i mean rockstar even had event for rp servers recently
[8:02:02] Sneaky2x: Rockstar as porposefully not DMCA FiveM and worked with them before purchase even with the copyright on servers
[8:02:04] dezalbos: Sure the mechanics will be close to perfect but pay to win is a huge concern PepeLaugh that alone will ruin servers
[8:02:04] ChangaloaCartel: Jesus when did this chat move so fast lmao. My comment is gone as soon as I hit enter wtf
[8:02:08] RatherBeInside: NODDERS and it was doing just fine before then too for just online
[8:02:11] Potato_Masha_NZ: gta online brings them in hundreds of millions lol always has
[8:02:13] witbull09: top ten on twitch?
[8:02:23] witbull09: or steam?
[8:02:23] MartLz: its gonna be the same game engine
[8:02:23] RatherBeInside: it was doing great on youtube at least
[8:02:26] PimplyBunz: it was tops back then
[8:02:27] itzrainmannn: someone check Wayback Machine
[8:02:28] CamVsGame: i met two chicks online that still play GTA online
[8:02:35] RatherBeInside: NODDERS
[8:02:43] I3itches: Youtube is for Minecraft
[8:02:44] djene: Yt gta races is big
[8:02:52] toesly: GTAV has sold 190,000,000 copies
[8:02:54] ScreenFresh: gtaonline was never big on twitch
[8:02:57] toesly: making it the second highest selling game of all time
[8:02:59] Dataman10: RP is only good if all players play by the rules... if it becomes mainstream I could see this value disappearing
[8:03:03] PimplyBunz: 2013 back when streamerhouse and others were killing it when it came out
[8:03:04] baiz_tv: csgo and wow was in the top for a long time though?
[8:03:06] SaltySalel: What year was arma days? Way back machine the game browser page for that time to see

[8:45:02] ChangaloaCartel: My main is the 32" Samsung G7 its badass 240hz
[8:45:02] JoyToyJay: 27" is WAAAAY big enough, especially with how close you're probably sitting
[8:45:04] Yatsok: looks very well thought through
[8:45:06] Civrock: 27" is fine for 1440p.
[8:45:09] Azhogh: 27" is the sweetspot
[8:45:17] johnnytwotimed: I personally think the 27 is perfect. I have 2 27' lg panels
[8:45:19] AbeFroman2: oled is the big seller
[8:45:19] Civrock: Gotta go 4k for anything bigger or it's just bloated pixels.
[8:45:24] johnnytwotimed: both 1440[
[8:45:35] JoyToyJay: @Civrock yup, at in that same vain, going 4k on a 27" is a waste XD
[8:45:38] Galacticowboy: 27 is stretching it if it's arms length
[8:45:40] ChangaloaCartel: I used to think the same until I got a 32
[8:45:44] Yatsok: @Azhogh agree
[8:45:53] johnnytwotimed: @Civrock Yea agrered, if that 32 was a 4k oled it would be amazing
[8:45:54] AbeFroman2: im interested in a ultrawide
[8:45:55] Civrock: 4k side monitors.
[8:46:06] kitkatmollywhop: i‚Äôve always been curious about the curved monitors
[8:46:06] Lordbidwell: Flex
[8:46:06] Civrock: Fit more content.
[8:46:09] I3itches: does it have that slight curve to it? I love those
[8:46:13] kitkatmollywhop: never used one
[8:46:16] ChangaloaCartel: Nah 32 for side monitors is a waste of money and space
[8:46:16] JoyToyJay: can you even call yourself a professional streamer without 8k monitors? Kappa
[8:46:35] Galacticowboy: I never liked the curvs
[8:46:39] JustCallMeWeed_: There was an OLED monitor that came out but had a blueish tint to the screen, wonder if this one fixes that isssue
[8:46:40] Galacticowboy: curves
[8:46:45] AbeFroman2: i always spot shit on a curved
[8:46:45] ChangaloaCartel: I'm not a fan of curve. Had one and switched back
[8:46:47] woodyikes: i think curve would have to be for my main monitor if i did that
[8:46:52] PimplyBunz: useless gimmick curve screen lol
[8:47:03] AbeFroman2: curved ultrawide sounds ok
[8:47:06] ChangaloaCartel: Curve side monitors is absolutely asinine
[8:47:10] woodyikes: @PimplyBunz more immersive lmao
[8:47:17] mrfreetooplay: Congrats Mac

[8:47:31] PimplyBunz: @woodyikes no... not even in a movie theatre...lol
[8:47:40] ChangaloaCartel: Curve monitors is like when 3d TVs were the big thing lol
[8:47:41] kitkatmollywhop: i can hardly tell the difference between 720 and 1080
[8:47:44] MartLz: most rtx cards dont need a capture card maybe im wrong
[8:47:48] woodyikes: hahaha had to give it a try bro!
[8:47:50] boyvdboschh: Why does you steam overlay say 1250 fps but ingame is 90~
[8:48:01] boyvdboschh: 125*
[8:48:25] mrfreetooplay: 1440p @ 120 refresh rate seems to be the sweet spot for me.
[8:48:31] johnnytwotimed: Do you run windows 11? I run both my displays the same refresh but the times i havent since going to 13th gen intel i havent had that issue anymore with cloning the display.
[8:48:40] chadford75: Curved monitors/Tvs lasted as long as 3d Tvs did

[9:04:49] Lordbidwell: That city
[9:04:51] chadford75: This should be the standard of all gaming but it feels like games get forced and unfiinished
[9:04:54] SeriousOn: it is "unreal"
[9:04:57] graphiteveins: gta 6 rp will show us what we can do with a greater engine.
[9:04:59] sychotixx: Looked it up on google, this is confirmed to be a tech demo and will NOT become a real game
[9:05:02] Kixet: PepegaAim
[9:05:11] Tremic: rendering a video is still very different from rendering a game

[9:06:17] AbeFroman2: its filmed on a ps5
[9:06:18] Lepaca: some people like to complain just to complain
[9:06:23] JoyToyJay: @Timmac too hard to tell what is ACTUALLY in-game rendering and what is just a pre-rendered video tbh; and on top of  all of it, what kinda pc can possibly run this smoothly LUL
[9:06:24] AbeFroman2: its a ps5 generating this
[9:06:28] Lordbidwell: It's a game engine demo
[9:06:35] Kixet: @MartLz who said we dont get it ?

[9:07:18] chadford75: You can still DL the demo and find out
[9:07:21] RatherBeInside: mart thinks game development is just place it down and things happen can't understand what he's looking at NODDERS
[9:07:24] Kixet: @PimplyBunz KEKW
[9:07:31] Tokens210: the unimpressed person must be from the future cause this trailer/gameplay blew everyone away when they released it
[9:07:32] Xintherios: First Time Chadder
[9:07:39] AbeFroman2: you are hard to impress mart
[9:07:39] BYOSHOCK: Sad to see devs who think people want this kinda gameplay, over the stories that we could tell in this setting with rp
[9:07:41] ChangaloaCartel: You can have your opinions doesn't mean they're correct lol
[9:07:42] dezalbos: Chatting I play on mac

[9:13:41] Kixet: gta is Rage Engine ya NODDERS
[9:13:43] I3itches: something like RAGE 9
[9:13:51] R3dl1nes: @Timmac didnt someone port SC in to unreal 5 abit ago to see if it was possble ?
[9:13:52] graphiteveins: GTA 5 RP is gonna survive until modders find a way to start on 6.
[9:13:56] Tokens210: modding community is probably a large reason these 10 plus year games keep going, they add stuff and keep it fresh, gets stale they dd it again

[9:16:21] SeriousOn: look at skyrim mods
[9:16:27] JoyToyJay: Depends on IF they can monitize people playing modded versions of the game
[9:16:36] SailorWS: Residual sale < resales of exact clones
[9:16:37] ccoraxx: DayZ
[9:16:38] BeCooper: They see it as niche compared to casual gamers

[9:16:46] JoyToyJay: if it's a buy-once type of game; doesn't matter if people play 50 hours or 5000 hours :)
[9:16:46] SeriousOn: community mods are the one that keep the old games goig
[9:16:47] ChangaloaCartel: Well you're part of his group that is in charge of the properties so naturally you should have a stake in all of them even with minimal investment
[9:16:50] SoulElement5: they want the community to suffer and to pay more for it LUL
[9:16:51] Ruffnready91: Look at farm sim still has 300 mod to be tested this week game is 2 years old

[9:16:59] AbeFroman2: nopixel must be making rockstar bank
[9:17:06] Tokens210: you dont need to monotize it if ppl are still buying your 10 year old game due to mods, that you making sales off someone elses work, win win
[9:17:17] graphiteveins: Community server lists need to come back. Those helped modding communities a LOT.
[9:17:18] Vomica_75: you out of rolls to wash?
[9:17:22] Namutski: @JoyToyJay base game will be expensive, modding introduces the game to people who wouldn't normally buy it
[9:17:27] Kixet: @Tokens210 It was all about permissions... fx having normal car logo's.. wich isnt legal.. copyrights.. But they fixed that with some rules now . so they gave us permissions to use it again.
[9:17:50] JoyToyJay: @Namutski Yea I can follow that train of logic, but I am also doubtful that is actually the case. I think the % of people buying a game based of modding is exceedingly small

[10:13:10] chadford75: Went from takin sim cards to takin a house key..
[10:13:10] markwalker92: The lock is 500 plus the price of a new key for everyone who had one
[10:13:11] TheSimpleLiquids: key being 3k is a little nutty
[10:13:12] Nagini_Rowle_: They should be like 100$

[12:45:49] ChaBoiShottz: depreciation on rentals allows you to claim a % of the value as a deduction. it reduces your cost base so when you sell you are paying a larger gain. recapture is the portion of the gain that is taxed as income rather than a capital gain up to the original cost
