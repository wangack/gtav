[0:14:18] VoidanceMusic: om
[0:14:18] azurevein: get over it, it aint that serious
[0:14:18] Dysotopia: they can camp, it is considered gang on gang 6 vs 6, cops can show up, but no other gang or person can as that would be 3rd partying
[0:14:18] sergio4: oh om
[0:14:18] Villenthessis: Vee a thugg it's fine
[0:14:19] qihk: walk of shame

[0:14:47] PrettyKrazy: its fine, you live and learn
[0:14:50] Dysotopia: but if cops are there and you are on the heist they can't 3rd party until cops are out of it
[0:14:51] PrettyKrazy: yea it was fine
[0:14:52] sinful_desires: @Dysotopia wrong in the rules it says you cant mess with someones heist and they had started it already
[0:14:54] Tigerlilee21: Eugene shouldn't have been driving around the get away car like he owned it.
[0:14:54] printerman22: @dysotopia it’s against server rules to camp a heist spot once it’s been started
[0:14:56] azncheesy: they were confuse as well LUL
[0:14:56] ribs010: yooo
[0:15:00] azh314: its JP, he doesnt really RP

[0:15:48] azurevein: it was such a non event that your taking to heart
[0:15:52] thuxury4play: He got GOOD
[0:15:54] PrettyKrazy: those guys are used to people saying NO to gun rp and just stabbing them or running away, by that standard you were great
[0:15:55] Flugger1: on what?
[0:15:57] onxly_jj: it won’t let me sub with prime
[0:16:00] Dysotopia: i would agree just camping the heist is bad, but if you have intel on what is going down you can act on that intel
[0:16:00] sinful_desires: what they did yesterday was wrong tbh

[0:16:12] crazyiitopii: @billasensei devs just need to cut that shit out like they did the drones camping
[0:16:12] KrimpSalad: tbh it was pretty on-brand for Vee to react like that after her day LUL
[0:16:12] kojobach: Kebun and X both said it wasn't a rulebreak so idk peepoShrug
[0:16:13] nonnahshannon: don’t ask them for their opinions pls
[0:16:14] Hents: i dont think anyone except for you even remembers that incident PepeLaugh
[0:16:14] DaftFrik: @sinful_desires NP is roleplay over ruleplay, so you gotta let the admins decide what it is
[0:16:15] Alonort00: hahaha after an hour of that stress i would be whatever to a gun hhaha irl
[0:16:17] legion_al: vee is a gangster and handled it like a gangster lol
[0:16:19] neopran: @billasensei they did mess with a group's heist after the heist got started. so technically it's against the rules... now the punishment is another story
[0:16:19] CowsAndStuff: yesterday was just exhausting
[0:16:21] Slaydess7: you are fine, you even aknowledge your mistake, that's better than most

[0:16:29] Alex2theMoon: I like that you acted like a normal person who was having a bad day. You should have to act like a robot and respond a specific way
[0:16:30] emrhys95: Its fine to not be satisfied with your rp that moment but remember you're new and you'll be more composed next time lol
[0:16:30] bongripznchickenstrips: y’all soft
[0:16:31] megasoy: you guys are noobs, these guys been doin this shit for years. shit happens.
[0:16:31] rudytc: contain Raia
[0:16:35] azurevein: let it go
[0:16:35] PrettyKrazy: those guys are used to people saying NO to gun rp and just stabbing them or running away, by that standard you were stellar @Acie
[0:16:36] Pajano255: Yesterday was just crazy
[0:16:36] relentless_: Put RAIA asleep, and do the heist KEKW
[0:16:38] lightwarrior2088: you did fine
[0:16:39] willowompoo: asking rp chat for their opinions nmpKEK
[0:16:39] thuxury4play: RP but the whip wit NENE
[0:16:40] azh314: vader said the same thing
[0:16:42] Crewcabanger24: the planning kinda fucks you up before anything even happens
[0:16:42] alilounft: @kojobach it wasnt
[0:16:43] MeleeGames: You're new to RP, what matter is that you care
[0:16:43] SlUWAX: yeah they fucked up
[0:16:44] Jackpic07: it would definitely have been better RP
[0:16:45] An0m4ly1337: I don't think it was that out of charter for Vee to be over it and done right then I think you played it fine
[0:16:45] taufler: Agree
[0:16:45] CobraKaifromHawaii: so much happened before nobody can blame you for not beign in it at that point
[0:16:45] Juan2K: i think its okay to be IC annoyed if you get robbed multiple times
[0:16:45] rawrguera: you were goood the whole thing was fun to watch
[0:16:49] natty111000: @2six2crew they did let themselves get robb3ed
[0:16:50] Syntai_dev: @relentless_ Bro all of them were cooked af
[0:16:50] lemonsANDlemurs: Get the experience of doing it
[0:16:50] sinful_desires: yeah they were supposed to let you do the hesit
[0:16:51] Sitinduk: embrace failure in this game @Acie dont fear it
[0:16:52] Roro_____: i think the gun think wasnt a big deal, you coudl tell that you were shocked and went back as soon as u realized whats going on, you run for liek 1 sec, thats no big deal
[0:16:52] crazyiitopii: If the drones were power gaming camping a heist has to be too KEKW
[0:16:52] jbt445: they didnt rob after bc clayton ran into their guy and they had to fight
[0:16:54] mrbouda1: thats what they wanted to do
[0:16:55] sinful_desires: then rob you
[0:16:57] benjasi1: I mean, I was exhausted just watching, so it is understandable
[0:16:57] onxly_jj: !subprime
[0:16:58] Dysotopia: @Acie they would have to wait until the cops are off of you
[0:16:59] shellfiee: shit like that happens all the time when you trust the wrong people, its los santos, civ gang just has to learn and get tougher
[0:17:00] ashleyferns: Robbing during a heist is a rule break fyi
[0:17:01] mectuka: they could have just asked for a trade
[0:17:02] gijojoe: what happened?!
[0:17:02] ambas1ng: https://clips.twitch.tv/PeppyPreciousCodTooSpicy-kYbWXuJ6zYY1r-0g 󠀀
[0:17:02] qihk: and eugene was in a cop chase too
[0:17:04] igbertt: All of u should listen to Eugene and the heist will be completed without calling to Peanut and saying everyone about your plan
[0:17:04] Dysotopia: or that would be 3rd partying
[0:17:04] Tenivir: yeah it was just confusing from your POV, it made no sense what they did
[0:17:04] Alonort00: u guys keep saying, that raia, clay´s fault, its X fault! He just want everything
[0:17:05] Mr_Tvi: I honestly think you guys need to just designate someone to call the shots during heists.
[0:17:05] azncheesy: they thought Clayton was starting it
[0:17:06] itsforthechildren: they robbed you of the experience Sadge
[0:17:06] Phasehero: You did fine @acie in life people give up on situations and are deflated. You were fine! Please be easier on yourself.
[0:17:08] N0Ne123: Even if you started it, what was the plan ?
[0:17:09] sqdrager: Yea the rp could have been better but that level of rp can be tough to do in those high pressure scenarios
[0:17:09] Elgid2000: THat Denzel know how to do sani the right way
[0:17:09] CRlCK: Clayton
[0:17:10] MarioG2208: I think it was obvious that all of you guys were pretty exhausted at that point, so you are a human, shit happens you know. So much went wrong yesterday frem so many aspects, so it's understandable
[0:17:11] joyoruz: its all good what if u got new color
[0:17:14] cebron808: bringing the second dongle was dumb

[0:17:16] Taxike: Clayton spotted them camping thats why they killed him
[0:17:17] thuxury4play: NENE but she was waiting for
[0:17:17] rawrguera: peanut is just dumb lol
[0:17:18] Ceasaa3: They wanted to make you guys the hostages @Acie
[0:17:18] doctor_makxx: @relentless_ nah, simply don't let her plan anything, take her phone away and they will be fine
[0:17:19] nonnahshannon: SHANNON

[0:17:22] te13an_khongkai: Where will they stream hal's tournament?
[0:17:23] Dysotopia: from the intel they got, they could make you do the job and take your loot
[0:17:24] Alaineman: It's rule breaking even if they don't get reported for it
[0:17:24] almightydolla: I think you definitely missed a bigger RP opportunity because you were so disappointed IRL...it HAPPENS, nothing to worry about
[0:17:25] HuntsMan_xcii: It was a comedy of errors nobodies fault just poor timing throught the whole event
[0:17:26] khlcsl: honestly I am just waiting for someone to bait them into the laundromat then boxing them in with a huge ass truck and call the cops KEKW
[0:17:28] Azyraft: im just glad k and jp werent able to get any usb from civ gang
[0:17:28] np7092: It’s cool. Vee actually saved them a few bullets.
[0:17:28] RepulsiveElf: it only went so bad because one of them accidently name dropped infrront of clayton
[0:17:29] emrhys95: Dw , NUnu is almost back LUL
[0:17:29] azurevein: bro stop. your overthinking shit to hard

[0:17:41] irascible23: Essaying holy
[0:17:43] christofromauld: Why give them an out.  They were cringe af. Hope their fans enjoyed watching them crouch for over an hour
[0:17:44] Taxike: BlushHug BlushHug BlushHug
[0:17:45] lightwarrior2088: cant 3rd party heists after, only before @acie
[0:17:47] kojobach: @Alaineman Np admin over here KEKG
[0:17:48] Wesker889: SAVEME NUNU
[0:17:51] shellfiee: we need an overthinking emote
[0:17:51] orange51611: less variables when camping, if you rob someone after the heist they may lose the dongle to cops or you may successfully evade them etc
[0:17:52] PrettyKrazy: peepoShrug anyways

[0:17:57] thuxury4play: Clayton fuckin UPP
[0:17:59] Dysotopia: yeah don't over think it.
[0:18:01] Setback1: they can just rob the stick after u sxtaret and doing the hack
[0:18:01] Roro_____: they said anyone can do the hacks, u jsut had to cut power
[0:18:03] crazyiitopii: Was funny Kebun chat was screaming that your chat meta gamed but Kebun chat is the epitome of meta gaming chatters LUL
[0:18:04] IraqiWizard: hello
[0:18:06] Junkee27: clayton should be subbed for patar imo
[0:18:09] willowompoo: this guy nmpKEK
[0:18:14] xFpy: what annoyed me is, what they did was against the rules
[0:18:14] autisticpepe1: FeelsStrongMan Clap
[0:18:15] PrettyKrazy: yall gotta get jason and clay fired from g6 EleGiggle
[0:18:18] Dysotopia: just understand what 3rd partying is as to why they couldn't rob you after the job
[0:18:19] rumsmokerr: Stronge
[0:18:19] Sivvii_: FeelsStrongMan Clap
[0:18:24] Moxxie92: Howdy yall
[0:18:30] Flugger1: I think too many people had progression in mind and not RP yesterday it was a bit weird, it was still fun to watch because of all the drama but not the best rp day
[0:18:31] SSGHaseeb: they are  just dumb the cg that is
[0:18:35] semer94: I don t think that was their plan. They were holding position but Clay checked the roof and they had no option but to hostage him. otherwise the whole plan is screwd.
[0:18:37] KiloCaeso: @Acie u guys going to get ur butcoin back today?
[0:18:44] nonnahshannon: @acie DID YOU get your dress
[0:18:47] isp1337: sez him
[0:18:48] crazyiitopii: Clay getting caught was the way we found out LUL
[0:18:48] Alaineman: @xFpy yup. not interfering with other people's heists is a rule, but no crimers care about that rule
[0:18:49] Phasehero: No you have to be part of the job to do the hack they werent
[0:18:49] Slaydess7: they cut the -1 LUL
[0:18:53] WizzyAW: did you get your 2am drop?
[0:18:55] theroach97: turn clip volume up??? plz
[0:18:57] PrettyKrazy: yea it was them having two different plans on top of yours
[0:18:58] deltron__: This isn't specific to yesterday, but I've noticed you tend to talk to chat a lot when you're in the middle of intense rp situations and miss out on participating fully in conversations. Like I worry you care more about us and that we're saying than just going with your gut. Like just ignore us. We make you worry more by coming up with extra ideas about stuff that you don't need to hear
[0:18:58] XEEDOUS: jason is worst he yapping to everyone
[0:19:03] buffalobeast210: wawa
[0:19:03] nonnahshannon: YEP
[0:19:04] StreamElements: YEP COCK
[0:19:04] ericxjmo: I mean… they were in the wrong. I’m pretty sure it’s against server rules to camp and steal heist.
[0:19:08] CRlCK: wawa
[0:19:08] Sivvii_: yesterday just seemed like a cluster fuck for everyone
[0:19:09] thuxury4play: Whats good with them not okay
[0:19:11] PrettyKrazy: shrug
[0:19:13] Dysotopia: yeah CG had a huge set back so they need to do what they could get back in the thick of being first for usb stuff

[0:19:24] qihk: Clayton was scared to voice id them but its only for voice changers.
[0:19:27] Tenivir: it was just too many parties trying to get involved in one thing, hard for it not to be a mess
[0:19:36] doctor_makxx: chat should be emote only during the heists

[0:19:37] crazyiitopii: @dysotopia so power gaming heist is the answer LUL

[1:27:17] balancedtofu: yeah nobody in this group will do tow
[1:27:18] Ricepatties: y'all need more members or interns for the gang
[1:27:18] whyminton: räia
[1:27:21] catquickspider: thats why you need interns
[1:27:22] moodybleu: maybe recruit members already doing the jobs?
[1:27:22] AlexNattes: The family needs a master mechanic and a master tow trucker
[1:27:24] Dano_Leza: nunu then tow truck?
[1:27:24] SSGHaseeb: they shouldn't cuz they can defend there self i mean
[1:27:24] blackberrycurve8530: the decay with other jobs makes it tough, cant build seperate reps and play together with the group
[1:27:28] KaBoomGodTV: wats ur rep now
[1:27:36] qihk: what we need is a gun
[1:27:36] thuxury4play: RAIA is BBG?
[1:27:37] JustAboveYou: is 100 the gateway to getting a lot of mats ?
[1:27:37] Fluffin04: what is the server max capacity?
[1:27:40] x_amer__: hello
[1:27:46] wildturkeyno9: Probably easier to recruit add a master tow truck driver to the gang
[1:27:48] P_Herbo24: tolan
[1:27:51] SSGHaseeb: !vanish
[1:27:52] StreamElements: SSGHaseeb went to go buy milk peepoLeave
[1:27:53] Taxike: I remember when raia had alot of money and did loan company :D
[1:27:53] Dano_Leza: G6 doesn’t really do anything yet could sacrifice clay to do tow truck as well?
[1:27:53] Tenivir: AlexNattes nah tow is literally only lockpick bp atm, they know people with it, they just needs mats to make it
[1:27:54] Alonort00: imagine, with raia on sani makes more sense that u can make some money
[1:27:56] twitchiquette: imGlitch 160 🤔
[1:27:57] SpecialAgentSkye: @twitchiquette Different per job. Some give new jobs, with better pay. Some are purely money based. Others give "apps" on pc/tablet. Others give materials that everyone needs for crafting. Others give unlocks in the form of blueprints so you can craft other items
[1:27:58] qihk: we need larry
[1:27:59] lowestnewt: insane
[1:27:59] JustAboveYou: from 160 to 300 how long will that take @Acie
[1:28:01] nonnahshannon: zzzz
[1:28:04] whyminton: When will u get 300
[1:28:07] JustAboveYou: 10 a day whoa
[1:28:07] Fluffin04: @JustAboveYou yes
[1:28:08] nonnahshannon: idea of fun eh
[1:28:09] RevillianGG: gotta make it like wow
[1:28:11] BubFrost: @Dano_Leza its an RP server, grindy but still they dont "need" to treat it like an mmo, they contribute in other ways
[1:28:19] teeeyy: you don´t do g6 then anymore?
[1:28:19] cak3tin: Oh he still talking peepoTalk
[1:28:21] jas3y: so another 2-3 months?
[1:28:22] MaxaMinor: @JustAboveYou yeah because compacting gives recycled mats at that point
[1:28:23] tomo123: Jason needs to recruit a new girl tower mechanic for his harem

[1:28:24] qihk: do you get faster rep with someone at 300?
[1:28:24] Pajano255: Civ gang's gotta recruit
[1:28:25] Crazyman114: it's about 500 runs
[1:28:27] Taxike: Without G6 it would be faster
[1:28:28] whyminton: weed talkz with grampa
[1:28:33] twitchiquette: imGlitch when do we get the penthouse
[1:28:34] Tenivir: the problem with lockpicks is the material cost, not that you need access to blueprints
[1:28:35] Dano_Leza: now that you aren’t doing G6 runs you won’t lose rep
[1:28:36] Flugger1: Just stop doing G6 and it will be a lot faster

[2:29:14] simmeringteapot: you guys are playing the same game 12h a day, of course you’ll get burnt out
[2:29:16] DataCookie: feels like you need to play 10 hours a day

[2:29:39] Tenivir: noone is forcing the grind other than yourselves though, you CAN take a break from that stuff
[2:29:39] shivang1497: you need to save eli from dundee's gang
[2:29:44] erik__85: streamer awards destroyed the vibes

[2:30:06] simmeringteapot: attend events in the city, you don’t have to always grind
[2:30:07] skumskilla: @cowmolester yea, he doesnt stream though
[2:30:10] fly_eagles_: make new friends, new experiences
[2:30:12] Strifes_de: it's the best job on the game, no?
[2:30:16] 42arc: it's the most important job in the city, ofc it's gonna be hard
[2:30:21] icecreamnuke: More jobs are being released and hopefully racing soon
[2:30:22] woodleaguelad: @Timeriot except he robbed them and prevented them from doing the laundry job xd
[2:30:23] Divine_Saint: Yea dont let it be runescape, take 3months for easy skill to max
[2:30:27] hafcabbage: some people enjoy slow pace maybe thats why
[2:30:28] tooshayyyyy: cuz it gives the mats the most importante stuff
[2:30:30] thatdudedave20: @timeriot Unless he’s robbing you
[2:30:31] Arwoooo: I think if the whole crew did it together and had a laugh during it, it would also be half the battle but so many people cant be bothered so seem to lack energy when doing it.
[2:30:34] pixelrbit: they should just remove progression from jobs. otherwise it's just a grindfest mmo
[2:30:38] Slaydess7: it's the only source tho
[2:30:38] blackdoos: people just take progression over RP anyday, the system would be fine if not every gang wanted to be on top
[2:30:38] catquickspider: @cowmolester he has been on last three days
[2:30:40] Hollowshaun: material gorl
[2:30:41] marcohiguera01: Is not the servers fault tho is the people in it no ?
[2:30:42] shivang1497: But its probly the most consistent job in the city
[2:30:48] Timeriot: @woodleaguelad I know, I’ll miss Zaceed for that
[2:30:48] KaBoomGodTV: City is fueled by materials
[2:30:50] Hollowshaun: nice driving the apex corners
[2:30:54] Olvi12: by the looks of it they will always be super important
[2:30:55] shivang1497: like you will always be able to do sani no matter felonies and all
[2:30:55] whyminton: Sanitation is imp to keep the city clean yep
[2:30:56] Crazyman114: its' not a good job though
[2:30:57] nonnahshannon: I gotta biss
[2:31:00] Strifes_de: i mean... if there will be no other source of materieals sani will stay on top
[2:31:00] emrhys95: you can start practicing your rp skills when things are slow kekw

[2:31:49] icecreamnuke: People get robbed after hours of work and give up
[2:31:50] ediblemaster: jason and alex just chatting about mirror park houses
[2:31:53] Timeriot: If the family kidnapped Dundee I really think it would end up with a BBMC teamup

[5:01:31] cristina217: to be fair civ gang already has beef with cg and x anyway
[5:01:31] SpecialAgentSkye: Chat is being stupid. The only thing -1 about it was your comment of "I dont carry anything valueable anyway". Hanging with him is NOT nvl. Its a choice
[5:01:32] eXceLenT_: monkaW RP experts in chat
[5:01:34] glossyeyedgal: it's not NVL it's your character

[5:01:35] Kingoftherandos: You aren't his family
[5:01:36] Bocha___: Don't give them validation their logic is stupid... Like we all should not go out of our houses because ppl rob and kill every day IRL is just kids
[5:01:37] 1iwill: It's the same cuz Larry is your bff now
[5:01:40] LookItzJoe: That's not what nvl even means

[5:34:06] BlindFlapjack: you can say theres problems adding more than 15?
[5:34:07] BorealisLumina: its not meta if its scuff or game mechanics
[5:34:08] x_amer__: no u can say it forget the first one
[5:34:09] mandym00n: just say causes a power surge an shuts the first rack down

[5:34:40] krakenthedog: Say a demon steals the first one

[5:36:07] inuinnaq_ttv: Hiii @Acie :D
[5:36:09] riledupriley69: Its not meta cause it scuff, if you dont tell them then theyre gonna link a rack and lose the first one + all gpus
[5:36:15] ZatashD: Rotate the wall ones you will get more space
[5:36:22] KaBoomGodTV: thats like months from now tho right
[5:36:23] eruhen17: Can you fill the inner one with good GPUs and seal it off?
[5:36:23] StreamElements: eruhen17, no
[5:36:23] iHarsh29: replace them with good ones and keep them in front
[5:36:25] SpecialAgentSkye: @Rockhound__97 Multiple reasons. Old gpus need to be upgraded to the new ones. And gpus in general decay over time, so they have to replace them eventually anyway
[5:36:27] Rockhound__97: Oh ok Degrade...  well newest in back and old up front and rotate
[5:36:29] IraqiWizard: Also there might be new gpu's in the future that are better than 660s
[5:36:32] 42arc: between pc and racks and wall there's so much space
[5:36:34] ZitroneSimo: Jackass
[5:36:39] Crowz7: Tell them about the 15 Racks scuff

[5:36:45] qihk: hard drive is most important
[5:36:46] imshades: Jason said he will never replace the old gpus like 2min ago
[5:36:47] mrAuctor: is it really worth risking it?
[5:36:48] iHarsh29: it won't

[5:37:23] umudoffy: You also need to recreate the room since you cant link racks up without it being in the room. @acie
[5:37:23] Rliy: take the gpus out
[5:37:28] Tresch: "feel like" is not good :D
[5:37:30] isp1337: gpus are not big, just take them out
[5:37:30] SpecialAgentSkye: Fuck it. Try it with the old gpu rack
[5:37:31] Rliy: its easy to make a rack than 6 gpus
[5:37:33] Rockhound__97: @SpecialAgentSkye ok, was wondering .... i mean making a huge wall of back to back to back ... etc  would save space  lol
[5:37:35] Tresch: dont touch that scuffed stuff
[5:37:37] Shikafrecko: cant u still get in them if they sideways
[5:37:37] Kraenit: its also on eugene to miss cops, so you need confidence in what you do

[5:38:15] YoinkDoink: just move the goass
[5:38:16] mishegas: add a row?
[5:38:16] mandym00n: i wouldnt rick moving the pc
[5:38:17] PRE5TO_: dot the racks have to be in the linked room
[5:38:17] Azhela: You have moved the PCs with racks connected before, just take out everything inside
[5:38:17] qihk: im 100% for moving the PC
[5:38:18] BlindFlapjack: it can become a server room after moving the PC
[5:38:19] umudoffy: Yeah the room fucks it
[5:38:20] SpecialAgentSkye: @Rockhound__97 True, but having walking space wouldnt be a bad idea. The issue in the first place is moving anything has a chance to POOF it
[5:38:21] 42arc: 1door*
[5:38:21] mandym00n: risk*
[5:38:23] Tyreck: turn one and see what happens

[5:38:24] Clue13: test move a rack with one old gpu in it?

[5:38:44] Tyreck: one by one
[5:38:44] girlballor: just wait to do it to when the server is stable
[5:38:50] Azyraft: if jason is aiming for a 100 but/day then only solution is to make a new rack room now
[5:38:57] eruhen17: @k_enix Great trolling
[5:39:01] 42arc: 4 racks on glass wall
[5:39:01] Rokuach: Jason said earlier that he wants to move to mirror park
[5:39:02] SpecialAgentSkye: @Acie Maybe have one old gpu only, in one rack, and try to move it. See what happens. Minimal loss

[6:00:17] DreamsPeek: Unfortunately OTT doesn't trust Eugene because of Eugene's statements and behaviors and Eugene actively says he's not going to let go
[6:00:17] wildturkeyno9: Eugene is more criminally savvy than anyone else in the group by far. He does have baggage thou
[6:00:18] ANTiN0VA: come up with clever plans that dont involve the cops chasing you

[7:20:16] walrus_from_space: open up the line so the turn isnt as sharp and you keep more momentum @Acie
[7:20:16] jesleaks: Go in the left lane before entering a turn to the right, so you get the max amount of speed out of the turn @Acie
[7:20:18] YoinkDoink: positioniong

[7:20:23] 2wicked001: outside to inside of curve
[7:20:24] hubsbub1: When turning left, ure max right on the road

[7:20:35] CorveIius: i see wawa i post wawa
[7:20:37] blue_111011: your reverse stearing like when you slide on ice
[7:20:37] Rockhound__97: * Race Line *
[7:20:38] jesleaks: Go in the left lane before entering a turn to the right, so you get the max amount of speed out of the turn @Acie .
[7:20:40] Dumi90: if u go left turn go on the right side of the road before the turn for easier turn
[7:20:41] retarcl: maybe try it irl Hmm
[7:20:43] BlindFlapjack: Formula 1 strat
[7:20:45] Freppuchino: isnt apex line or whatever?
[7:20:48] pilhass10: that's what everyone does
[7:20:49] InfamousHoole: so when you make a left turn lets say, you wanna line up on the right side of the road, hit the inside corner, and come out on the right side of the rd again
[7:20:50] VaeelL: basic racing line just like any racing game
[7:20:52] HoldMyGrenade: vee needs to wawa
[7:20:52] tooshayyyyy: yesss but not many people pay attention to that
[7:20:53] DaveShadows: NODDERS go wide
[7:20:56] pilhass10: if you watch formula 1 and shit
[7:20:58] InfamousHoole: so you're taking the turn as straight as possible
[7:21:00] AquaBerryBackFist: brake into the turn and accelerate out of the turn
[7:21:00] Sniffle04: you want to open up the corner, use entirety of the road
[7:21:01] HotRod0_0: When you go on the opposite of the corner the car will drive as straight as possible instead of following the hole curve
[7:21:01] BlindFlapjack: yo
[7:21:01] auxfrog: it’s giving yourself the most space without losing speed
[7:21:06] emrhys95: If you are turning left then turn right slighty before the left turn
[7:21:08] sourstuff: Think about the one Scene in Cars! where Hudson teaches McQueen how to turn
[7:21:09] Jetrospect: So the turn doesn't feel so sharp
[7:21:11] 2wicked001: :3

[7:21:31] Rockhound__97: He is doing race line tight hugging corners
[7:21:34] Sniffle04: the goal is to have the highest average speed througth the corner, which generally means having the highest speed at the apex and you do that by making it as straight line as possible

[7:35:45] eruhen17: Raia's car is awesome offroad!
[7:36:06] jesleaks: You're not supposed to always stay in the outer line, you're supposed to be in the racing line, which cuts into the inner line in the middle of the turn. Search up "raacing line" on google images
[7:36:22] FRAlex010: this is cool
[7:36:22] tryhaaardau: 57 mph

[7:38:21] selvinn: gotta brake with wheel straight before turning
[7:38:26] Flashthatuuu: Exactky. Don’t need to go really fast and then jam the breaks. That does no good
