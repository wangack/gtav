[3:21:22] boffe945: 3.0 grind was easy compare to 4.0 thats forsure
[3:21:47] sarahm9889: There will be
[3:21:47] WentToBuyMilkAgain: @dizzledaz nah there is, koil said there is a npc but no one has unlocked it
[3:21:48] ketsu93: there will be a mechanic
[3:21:50] Lunalynn4: There will always be racing rp in 4.0 regardless of a racing server
[3:22:02] dizzledaz: @WentToBuyMilkAgain chopping im guessing?
[3:22:12] sarahm9889: they wouldn't be putting so much work into cars if there wasn't a racing scene
[3:22:28] dizzledaz: i know there is a bank truck heist that the italians tried but the cops immediately showed up
[3:22:30] Jahnuuu: Racing app throught laptop or phone?
[3:22:34] Fugeki: Buddha mentioned that like 10% of the sever has been unlocked and that things will go crazy one heist and racing gets unlocked
[3:22:43] WentToBuyMilkAgain: @dizzledaz no clue, i don't think anyone reached 100 in chopping
[3:22:44] NoQox: did you see the new legacy tweet yesterday?
[3:22:51] SLPR290: I think organising races should still be RP based like it's behind closed doors sort of thing
[3:22:55] parvsolanki: Nice drifty weather for ur koienigsegg from 3.0 toonySip
[3:22:59] Auruanix: maybe it's unlocked behind chopping or something else
[3:23:31] Imthatedenguy: Considering everything is rep based I would like to see how that’s implemented into the racing scene
[3:23:38] Shad0w_wizard: nodd
[3:23:44] SLPR290: the B class race scene incident awaree
[3:24:11] vcripps: @Auruanix 4head did over 150 cars for 100 rep on chop and got nothing
[3:24:16] Ohkayei: Orange did this nodd
[3:24:25] papas_03: I like realistic RP it’s better and interesting than getting 200k car and a million dollar house in 2 weeks from the launch of the server but it also slows down progression creating spicy rp
[3:24:28] WentToBuyMilkAgain: Agreed
[3:24:41] goldencate: local car races would be great
[3:24:42] Shad0w_wizard: @papas_03 nodd
[3:24:58] CYDERVERSE: Good ol days classic
[3:25:08] tombull13: i think thats just because alot of people dont have cars currently
[3:25:22] parvsolanki: Maybe bcz blacklist seems like more of a dangerous thing than the app idk bt yea toonySip
[3:25:26] ketsu93: not many ppl can remember a track from looking at a map
[3:25:49] Lunalynn4: Also can be hard to learn the track that quickly without the gps thing
[3:26:15] ketsu93: yea, checkpoints and gps is huge for a lot of ppl
[3:26:17] SLPR290: yeah the blacklist has hidden elo
[3:26:25] magunbp: The elo would make people mad/tryhard
[3:26:28] bencoarner: passenger giving gps looks cool
[3:26:50] KING_BUBBLES_77: this guy calling himself a decent racer
[3:26:53] parvsolanki: It's gonna be a bragging thing
[3:27:13] AnthonyyGM: Altho' I think many people just do it for fun
[3:27:19] AnthonyyGM: Dont matter for them if they win or lose.
[3:27:30] Khaos_The_Lock: The most wanted stuff seems like a much better system than just using elo, was a good idea
[3:27:43] dizzledaz: most people are super competitive and dont want to race you because of the skill gap imo
[3:27:51] CYDERVERSE: Saved
[3:28:08] TheDins: i liked the different tiers of racing so other people could race against people around their skill level
[3:28:38] xdannyx98: i would smoke y`all if i raced on NP
[3:28:40] sarahm9889: yeah but also the only way to improve is to practice
[3:28:42] xdannyx98: just sayin RIPBOZO
[3:28:44] wheresjohnnyyy: Imagine racing like a rally with in companion at your side telling you the entire route
[3:28:52] sarahm9889: and you can learn a lot by racing others that are better
[3:29:12] DrakeNightbane: @sarahm9889 Yeah, you'll never get better just racing people of your skill level, you won't learn new things you might not have known with people at your skill imo.
[3:29:22] magunbp: @sarahm9889 like AP and Orange back in the day
[3:29:44] parvsolanki: Coz once u gotta numbered elo it's gonna be more like a status symbol so gud for role playing bt bad for jst having fun racing nd all idk bt we gonna get what we gonna get toonyWicked
[3:29:52] dexayed: how much does this job pay per hour
[3:29:57] magunbp: 2k
[3:30:00] Jahnuuu: Totally fine
[3:30:04] sarahm9889: i don't blame you
[3:30:11] sarahm9889: how long has it been?
[3:30:15] secret_passengerr: Yea racing for at least 2 month wont be the same as 3.0
[3:30:43] 24bandits: Do u use a rig or controller when playing racing sim
[3:30:57] Lunalynn4: Everything has been done before aswell
[3:31:18] FlackAttack94: ngl, ive just come to accept gta just isnt the best racing game LUL
[3:31:25] parvsolanki: Yup no real detailed driving experience
[3:31:32] TheCickenwing: until gta 6 comes out then we all be back
[3:31:33] ughfckit: the thing nopixel racing has that no other game does is the story aspect long-term
[3:31:37] parvsolanki: Not more real then AC
[3:31:39] ughfckit: like the roleplay is what makes is special, not the mechanics
[3:31:45] Jahnuuu: I cant say if i liked curbbosstin or not in this server
[3:31:48] SSCBlackDove: You should develop GTA racing MMR. You'd be at the top, and be able to race very few other racers. In return, your job should be organizing races, and essentially have people pay you NOT to race, but organize.
[3:31:51] FrederichSwart: Would be a great sideline job to offer up and coming racers training and advice at a fee, where you are passenger. Can be a good extra income. I.e. Racing lines, braking points etc.
[3:33:00] parvsolanki: I'm jst a recent follower of urs bt gonna say that very nice driving in assesta corsa like fr

[7:44:59] Evil_Monqey: buddhaWiggle buddhaWiggle buddhaWiggle
[7:45:06] Fugeki: is it still 1:1 or does rep increase monies

[7:45:21] EyeScraem: @Fugeki prob too low rep to know
[7:45:26] tannerrobbz: @fugeki I think rep will increase it
[7:45:38] xscoxevox: Ngl I'm curious if you get anything when you reach 100 rep with the money guy
[7:45:51] boobysmoke: Is this car sequential?
[7:45:59] Fugeki: you get a giant gold chain KEKW

[7:48:53] Fugeki: if the heist are 6 it would be cool they octo takes the vip and tonish the rest of the crew
[7:48:58] taladien: This is a good just drive jobs, perfect for Octo
[7:49:03] Ohkayei: WICKED
[7:49:10] TropicalToucan: @tannerrobbz it would have been very easy the first day because everyone need to clean but now people doing the jobs have spread out so it would be a lot of waiting around
[7:49:15] xscoxevox: Ngl I'm waiting for when yall play lethal company next that shit was hilarious lol

[8:00:11] Lloydcars: neutrenHi everyone
[8:00:18] snshot04: holy ratJAM
[8:00:24] liljeep1917: @Ohkayei ah okay
[8:00:31] iwr1techky12: @ProphecyEU At least in 3.0 he was generally against war and conflict
[8:00:41] KidChameleon_: noice
[8:00:43] EyeScraem: yea more money is way better nodd
[8:00:45] Evanoah0: 0.03 per 100
[8:00:50] OmgSofie: do i hear a cat? meow
[8:00:57] KumiXIV: meow
[8:01:02] EyeScraem: because of less time nodd
[8:01:03] lightstormclaw: whats rep now?
[8:01:05] ProphecyEU: @TropicalToucan like some people dont prefer the war rp etc. so try to stay clear of it etc. but its also sometimes the RP doesnt get a character involved, so i wondered which it might be
[8:01:06] g0m3rrrr: what's the downside to just doing the max?
[8:01:08] bruHoran: so 5k gets you 1.5 right?
[8:01:14] ketsu93: 1.5 rep per 5k NOTED
[8:01:19] Blavod: @g0m3rrrr risk probably
[8:01:20] Lunalynn4: @g0m3rrrr If someone robs you youll lose it all
[8:01:20] lemongrapel: i guess more money is more risk so more rep
[8:01:38] xanetrose: maybe there is an amount that gives high rep comapred to money spent
[8:01:39] g0m3rrrr: just drive away from robbers :D
[8:01:50] issitv_: @g0m3rrrr so i think, its cops get notified harder. but thats just my thought
[8:01:53] Ohkayei: @ProphecyEU earlier he said that he would enjoy wars, shootouts, but not the ones that last for long
[8:02:05] TropicalToucan: @ProphecyEU yeah and 4.0 seems way different with stuff like getting felonies and from what ive seen the cops/doj care more about your criminal history
[8:02:05] magunbp: no lofi allowed while money are getting cleaned Awkward
[8:02:07] Evanoah0: youll need to clean $315,250 to get to 100 rep
[8:02:24] xdannyx98: wheres the pepeVIXA
[8:02:27] Lunalynn4: @Evanoah0 Still or starting from 0?
[8:02:36] Evanoah0: still
[8:02:41] moonypxl: lofi vibes CatCozy
[8:02:42] Lunalynn4: Oh god
[8:02:44] Dice_DH: so need to do about 60 odd 5000 runs to max out?
[8:02:55] ProphecyEU: @Ohkayei ahh so that would be the answer; if the RP takes it there he wouldnt mind; but not over long period of time
[8:03:09] bruHoran: @Dice_DH YEP but still no idea what does that give you
