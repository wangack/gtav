[2:08:40] extractionss25: Like a big bird?
[2:08:40] AndruKalAndru: just turned the stream on   wtf is going on?

[2:09:02] ElanorJane: i think it is Ashley
[2:09:10] Stabross: And Ashley is way too fresh of a character for that KEKW
[2:09:11] AerialAce94: @andrukalandru norman bones support group basically

[2:09:37] bicuspidbag8537: Kiwo
[2:09:38] Stabross: Lauren Forcer - Kiwo
[2:09:39] MazMetal: Fey is far more involved in the lord side of death. Plus her serial killer vibes are showing
[2:09:42] neybersaber: Does anyone have the clip of the “white bird” ?
[2:09:42] Vinyl_Rabbit: Barry is a god
[2:09:45] extractionss25: Forcer
[2:09:49] MazMetal: Lore*
[2:09:54] bondiblue22: we need Jesus to kill Norman that's the only way

[2:10:10] bed_time_bates: one sounds like frost kind of
[2:11:00] gorofs: scraps can kill norman probably
[2:11:06] neybersaber: Do we think the white bird is Nancy? 🤔
[2:11:13] Lilliphus: someone OWNS it?
[2:11:20] Stabross: @gorofs Yeah, he probably can just one shot him

[2:12:09] Stabross: Just go old fashion and throw flowers to Norman, he seems to be weak to flowers KEKW
[2:12:10] Lilliphus: it's mostly cops here seems like
[2:12:16] CaptainCanuck18: definitely kinda sus

[2:12:25] elphiesaint: That what it is really is like half cops?
[2:12:25] ElanorJane: U dont even wanna know, how chaotic pd info on norman is.
[2:12:29] Stabross: Probably allergic to pollen
[2:12:33] VERT1G0NE: I still like the theory that the opposite of death is life... and the clue is in his last name.  Someone needs to bone Normie
[2:12:45] snorlax419: now Colin knows how many people made deals
[2:12:53] Stabross: AAAA

[2:13:42] spuds3432: what if we ask Dee really nicely to scream into norman's ass?
[2:13:43] ElanorJane: Well it is hard to kill hope i suppose
[2:13:50] extractionss25: From what Collin believes who are cops that are here is Dark, flop, Cody, pond, Tessa and that’s already a big list
[2:13:56] bluefreak1991: is this like a round table of his biggest fans?
[2:14:01] justkimm: BBMC is gonna be sitting on the rooftops with popcorn watching all these idiots try to defeat norman
[2:14:07] ArtlyEndeavors: sooooo what im hearing is: bonecon after party with just crims would be 10000% helpful
[2:14:18] Stabross: More than half the fucking table is a cop
