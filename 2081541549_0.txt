[0:51:31] T_Smooth_: Maybe you should stop drinking coffee doesn't sound like your body likes it LUL
[0:51:41] Idsertian: @carcool12 Honestly? I wouldn't. They take up too much room for only giving you the benefit of a splint and 1800 healing points. Take green bandages, esmarch/calok and analgin in your pockets, stuff an ifak or an afak in your butt, along with a splint and call it a day. Might have to wangle things if you need to take a docs case or whatever.
[0:52:04] StonedJourney: get some probiotics
[0:52:20] Kiddersteve: @SilentSentry to confirm people visited check points either make them post a pic in twatter or leave a code with the scene tool that they have to write down.
[0:52:49] Sohu: TPFufun
[0:52:51] carcool12: @Idsertian ok, so use the cats/esamrches and then only use the HP of the IFAK for healing?

[0:54:02] Kiddersteve: its a speedy treasure hunt game
[0:54:25] Idsertian: @carcool12 Yeah. IFAK loses way too many points for catching heavy bleeds. Use it for lights or straight healing. Only use it for heavy bleeds if you're out and can't find any new bleed meds anywhere. Once you get an injector case, you can start carrying zagustin stims into a raid with you and worrying less about that.

[1:31:20] Ryu_XIII: @jbrizzles imagine Davis getting sponsorships for the race from burgershot and cluckenbell XD
[1:31:58] fatbot2004: I think it'd be cool if you told three people to have the next checkpoint and met up with all the taxi drivers made them go to the spot world all the checkpoint people are waiting and they could tell him where the final spot is

[2:48:20] graua: i agree on that one
[2:48:24] carcool12: it might be your end issue cause I was seeing scenes work for other people
[2:48:29] JWM0420: I think the potential for Prime roleplay died with the advancement of in game mechanics being made for streamers.

[2:49:07] mrcasualxd: !watchtime
[2:49:29] JWM0420: like the true essence of RP in GTA was when mechanics were limited and people made something if nothing
[2:49:35] Sohu: HahaSleep

[2:50:06] ClassicSteve: sentryHB sentryHB sentryHB
[2:50:28] greeedly: the best roleplaying server is whatever server sentry is playin on am i right
[2:50:44] MysteryOfABloodRedRose: one of my favorites was sentry's first day of RDR 2 RP
[2:50:46] jdubz105: SentryBang
[2:50:47] torijinosa: @greeedly yup yuppp
[2:50:54] jovansjj: We miss the poker nights. Them were goooood rp
[2:50:59] JWM0420: like for example, people on ONX are like "I wish we had cocaine" but like you could just roleplay out having it. why do you need a dev to implement it with an effect?
[2:51:12] T_Smooth_: Yea hopefully Sentry finds another good Red Dead RP server again
[2:51:12] JWM0420: idk maybe I'm crazy
[2:51:15] Kiddersteve: @JWM0420 Truee
[2:51:26] chin00k30: I think the DayZ RP had that potential until power plays started happening.
[2:51:39] percidus_: CoolCat GlitchCat
[2:51:58] graua: i liked watching Ignite a lot, like you said yesterday that server had that "something" . sucks that it died so fast and i dont even know why it happened
[2:52:05] Kiddersteve: I wish people would just do the RP and then maybe they get mechanics over time
[2:52:06] carcool12: yeah like who TF says "theres not a lot of crime to do"
[2:52:14] jay_skyline_r34: Yeah but rping coke but they cant be arrested for it right where theres no proof of it I think that's there issues perhaps
[2:52:25] Meatyfrog: @graua greed, and cliques
[2:52:32] JWM0420: also I'd argue that if someone went and roleplay making and distributing cocaine without a mechanic, it would possibly lead to devs working to make it for you
[2:52:32] carcool12: @jay_skyline_r34 yes you can easily
[2:52:39] JWM0420: idk that they would but maybe.
[2:52:43] Runesocesius: @jay_skyline_r34 the roleplayer makes the proof, that's how it should go
[2:52:52] Kiddersteve: @JWM0420 Yes i agree
[2:52:56] Meatyfrog: @SilentSentry noone wants to be a "bad" criminal they just want to mechanically rob, not create conflict with other players
[2:52:58] graua: sentryFBM @Meatyfrog
[2:53:10] Raion2boot: Sadge
[2:53:37] JWM0420: @jay_skyline_r34 hear me out. if you Roleplay having coke and a cop searches you, you /me having Coke and then they can do with that what they do
[2:53:39] Bulfwyne: create a moment
[2:53:42] Galaxar40: This city definitely lacks antagonists tho
[2:53:50] Kiddersteve: You also could rob the place in RP
[2:53:58] Kiddersteve: just for the cool RP
[2:54:03] EyelessWolf: like dice games gamba in southside
[2:54:06] graua: everytime i see this store it reminds me of curtis
[2:54:11] CooperBuddha: car jacking and hostages are my fav way togo
[2:54:28] T_Smooth_: I like when you hide in people's trunks
[2:54:30] chubbzpwnz: can always do street racing
[2:54:36] MackManGG: People want every server to be just like NP. The high speed chases that result in a potential huge gain in money if successful but if unsuccessful they'll just get a slap on the wrist
[2:54:53] jovansjj: Debotchery
[2:54:54] jay_skyline_r34: I always thought it should be like main game it should maybe take a week of prep befor you can do the actual Heist
[2:54:56] JWM0420: idk, I feel like im a purest with these opinions but the tldr is there is a lot of crime that could be done and doesn't require the benefit of the in game economy making it worth it bc the fact you are doing cool crim roleplay should be the only reward that matters
[2:54:58] Neurotoxins: man I feel like you could make a character that could be a cool ass Mob boss King pin
[2:54:58] Runesocesius: i've witnessed the fall of servers cause of that shit LUL
[2:55:01] EyelessWolf: someone could start street races right now
[2:55:08] rummsdiebumms: make it like the bank robbery in rdr2 rp, limit it
[2:55:12] ShroudedFoxx: Hard to please everyone
[2:55:14] JWM0420: like when you did C, there was zero incentive to do that but you did it for the roleplay
[2:55:21] Kiddersteve: I think a lot of people forget what RP actually is, its just pretending be a person doing things.
[2:55:23] carcool12: I'm just surprised there has yet to be a single "Do you know who I am" encounters on here, and its honestly a breath of fresh air all ego-rp on nopixel
[2:55:44] rummsdiebumms: just put it in the rules, and hope people play fair
[2:56:06] rummsdiebumms: hard to find the best solution
[2:56:11] MackManGG: The other issue is that there is only 1 bank as of right now, until the FLEECA's get coded in.
[2:56:19] GizmoMCs: think in this server they trying to make it so these things involve interacting with other players
[2:56:21] graua: server doesnt even have any car customisation yet, let alone some street racer tuner mechanics. racing in normal cars is not fun @EyelessWolf
[2:56:39] Raion2boot: Double tap Pog
[2:56:40] Neurotoxins: .... go spend a bunch of the money that you just took
[2:56:44] jkestey: the last thing i would do the next day is go to work KappaHD
[2:56:51] EyelessWolf: @graua so just get crap cars and race

[2:57:05] CENSOR_FREE_THOUGHT: ever heard of striking while the irons hot? Kappa
[2:57:11] jarrodbruner: sounds like the perfect plan to me
[2:57:18] theglizzykisser: they never expect you to return to the scene of the crime BillyApprove
[2:57:19] Kiddersteve: @graua Honestly street racing can be great RP but i dont know it always becomes just a racing server.
[2:57:21] WhskyTangoFxtrot: Yeah, Bonnie and Clyde were idiots!
[2:57:28] pistolpete263: an in game irs would solve those issues
[2:57:31] DudeWheresMyTARDIS__: greedy
[2:57:36] K0D3R_: IDK Lester Gillis did it Kappa
[2:57:38] jovansjj: Wins lottery, bets it all on another lottery.
[2:57:51] graua: yeah if its only racing its also broing, might as well play need for speed then @Kiddersteve
[2:57:54] EyelessWolf: @Kiddersteve something needs to happen and it's not hard to get going
[2:57:56] GizmoMCs: there's been street races
[2:58:03] Raion2boot: lol

[2:58:06] MysteryOfABloodRedRose: EZY
[2:58:06] ayir: oh
[2:58:07] theglizzykisser: good one LULW
[2:58:09] rummsdiebumms: just close the bank after it got robbed for a week or so, people can get money at atm's. that could work
[2:58:10] TobeyTobes93: lol
[2:58:16] AndyAndyXD: LUL
[2:58:21] lknives99: Yea but the subathon
[2:58:31] EyelessWolf: @rummsdiebumms yeah that would work
[2:58:41] WolfgangAmpersand: Or at least doing so should make it that you lose it all. Not just the one you're currently doing.
[2:58:41] MackManGG: Its because too many people wanna min-max and let the RP fall to the wayside
[2:58:44] JWM0420: I miss C, that was one of the best characters of all time. was truly a giving RP concept and was for the benefit of a group that historically gets the worst end of the roleplay stick.
[2:58:51] MrAyeAxe: ziggy is magnificent right now
[2:58:52] rummsdiebumms: @EyelessWolf yup!
[2:59:22] DudeWheresMyTARDIS__: shark jumping fast food RP
[2:59:27] Neurotoxins: in game it should go against value of life trying to do it everyday if you're a content creator and can't make something out of different scenarios are you really as good as you think?
[2:59:34] jarrodbruner: i want to give belly scratches
[2:59:37] Runesocesius: who finds that repetition entertaining? 12 year olds?
[2:59:57] jovansjj: Lol
[2:59:57] lknives99: Trust. Root out the abusers.  Gotta be cold.
[2:59:58] RancidVomit86: I say just have heavier penalties for big crimes. like you character legit gets locked up for few days or something instead of 30 mins
[3:00:09] jovansjj: Ziggy does not have that dawg in him
[3:00:15] jdubz105: Meow
[3:00:16] Wool_story: I am in reality every day. In RP I don't want to sim a 9-5 everyday. So ye, Ima RP a bit of gone in 60 seconds/classic detective/drug runner/ adrenaline junkie play
[3:00:22] AndyAndyXD: Ziggy at the dog park for the first time!! [SentryStory] https://clips.twitch.tv/SincereMiniatureTrollNononoCat-MPFLClJqaw2q-vqk
[3:00:25] jarrodbruner: Just because something is popular doesnt mean it's good
[3:00:25] graua: if you wanna mindlessly grind stuff, go play fkn korean MMOs
[3:00:32] Sohu: FrankerZ
[3:00:36] lknives99: If u care about your server
[3:00:51] MysteryOfABloodRedRose: EZY +1 house
[3:00:58] 2aminportland: that’s why it’s seems like there’s a new ‘.0’ for servers every week. Everything just gets played out so quickly
[3:01:12] Syrinx69_: it doesnt even have to be your main character
[3:01:19] CENSOR_FREE_THOUGHT: their character could be a suicidal bank robber though
[3:01:20] EyelessWolf: hell even if the races suck cus crap cars just make it no holds bar races
[3:01:48] Robkeebler: risk vs reward
[3:02:07] JWM0420: also sucks bc that style of RP literally makes the quote on quote good guys the bad guys... like cops should be the heroes, but they get a ton of hate for arresting famous streamers
[3:02:12] Kiddersteve: but when the Risk is too high everyone complains
[3:02:21] Sean_Honnery: I believe they should add a sort of "soft" timer for robbing places, where the "payout" builds up over time, and resets after being robbed. - so if a place gets robbed too early, it's not worth it - and potentially variables could affect how quickly said place builds "value"..
[3:02:28] Pyro_Paul3: Now ur character going away for 3 to 5 days IRL that's a risk WutFace LUL
[3:02:29] Kiddersteve: people do say on ONX the risk for crime is too high
[3:02:33] iilucky_: I think Davis goes to his roots and joins the PD
[3:02:39] GizmoMCs: think here they want ppl to actually rob other players & business lol
[3:02:50] Raithe: or get them back like 30 days clean
[3:02:53] Robkeebler: on NP now, if youre a felon, cant do shit with business now
[3:02:53] NomadNorth28: @Sean_Honnery this is a great idea imo
[3:03:00] MysteryOfABloodRedRose: barking dog gonna wake him up? PauseChamp
[3:03:00] jovansjj: That would make crim a risk. As it should be
[3:03:14] JWM0420: being a business owner crim would be the hype that way
[3:03:15] lknives99: Censor when a player enters the target. Admin switches to the clerk.
[3:03:21] DudeWheresMyTARDIS__: like china
[3:03:32] graua: lol
[3:03:58] greeedly: I feel like mechanics can get the ball rolling when it seems like theres not a lot going on.
[3:03:59] Pyro_Paul3: And everybody on the server loves me including the cops WutFace LUL
[3:04:04] Kiddersteve: it still does that
[3:04:09] Axe556: hittler jesus is a good band name Kappa
[3:04:13] jcap28: yea pretty much the same rn
[3:04:14] mugenjosh: i think onx makes it so criminals cant own property or businesses?
[3:04:15] EyelessWolf: well you can if your smart about it
[3:04:30] Meatyfrog: @mugenjosh at least businesses NODDERS
[3:04:33] jcap28: just cant be a cop if you have a felony
[3:04:35] corndogandfriends: every person who runs a server should listen to this talk.  good stuff
[3:04:44] GizmoMCs: @mugenjosh felons cant own businesses ye
[3:04:58] EyelessWolf: IRL crims do that yeah
[3:05:02] Thatgooey: nopixel now is a lot more one or the other, but it's so... grindy at the moment
[3:05:13] carcool12: also sentry I want to say I cant watch I'd say 80% if not more of GTARP streams cause of their annoying alerts that disrupt RP, them talking to chat while interacting so you cant hear the RP ect. I've been spoiled by your RP-centric style
[3:05:20] Robkeebler: @GizmoMCs same with NP now. they cant even acess business bank accounts either, like look at them
[3:05:21] mctank93: scuff leads to getting caught though to, how would you deal with that
[3:05:26] Noir_PI: being under a microscope by detectives and heavily investigated as surface civ / mega crim can be such great rp
[3:05:37] Pyro_Paul3: But what if I want to make a character that all he does is fail but he's basically there to be an award system for the cops SeemsGood
[3:05:38] JWM0420: Sentry just needs to make crime RP happen. show these youngins lol
[3:05:38] isot0nic: hi @chat & @SilentSentry
[3:05:41] EyelessWolf: yeah
[3:05:48] g8rhead: i guess you gotta up the benefits for crims and civs in parity basically
[3:06:02] Kiddersteve: House robberies are coming soon, so its gonna be interesting to see how that plays out
[3:06:04] JWM0420: Dexter/doakes vibes would be sick
[3:06:07] matthewmc90: Awww Dayumn We got Silent Sentry Hell Yeah
[3:06:15] GizmoMCs: they working on house robberies rn
[3:06:23] Wool_story: My struggle right now on Onx is the fact I work full time and can't dedicate playing every day for 8+ hours, so working 'strictly civ' with the cost of so many things.. slowly spiraling into negative in funds
[3:06:51] MackManGG: A lot of these people that want "crim" stuff, they really want the instant dopamine that come with success. They aren't playing the long con of having a slow and steady dopamine drip, until the big thing drops and you get a huge dopemine hit.
[3:07:01] Meatyfrog: ONX needs more antagonists NODDERS
[3:07:02] brownieebananas: brownieebananas subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 46 months! 
[3:07:02] Moobot: It's time to throw up some !HYPE - @brownieebananas has hit that 3 year+ status with 46 months - Thank you bleedPurple
[3:07:06] Kiddersteve: you speak the truth
[3:07:12] SturmSauer: have more than one character
[3:07:12] chaosandlead: more stuff doesnt always mean better but having nothing to do also sucks
[3:07:13] Thatgooey: like ramee on nopixel was a lawyer for months and then got a felony and lost his bar license. no longer a lawyer
[3:07:23] Thatgooey: so they are going that way now
[3:07:28] Seriphax: Car customization can't go wrong
[3:07:33] EyelessWolf: crims should be able to remove gun serial number
[3:07:38] GizmoMCs: think mechanics should incentive player interaction
[3:07:58] greeedly: Should be able to paint your car though, I could do that in need for speed in the 90's.
[3:08:33] Soraffe: If you can't or won't do Grindy Streamer servers, the server I play on called Aftermath RP is pretty fun and the people are chill and RP serious
[3:08:38] Kiddersteve: Ignite devolved into a mess
[3:08:48] B1n4ryGaming: ignites admin team was very anti streamer too though
[3:08:56] MackManGG: @EyelessWolf Disagree. There should be certain people that have access to remove S/N's. Not just every crim, but say a leader or a person who has been given access by an admin to be able to do so
[3:09:10] DB991: ignite had pool MaxLOL
[3:09:26] EyelessWolf: @MackManGG it shouldn't be gated just hard to do
[3:09:26] liitty_savage: District 10 was wild tho
[3:09:30] jovansjj: What would make it anti streamer?
[3:09:38] Meatyfrog: ignite admins were very "pro money"
[3:09:38] rummsdiebumms: they were watching!!!
[3:09:38] jovansjj: Ooooh
[3:09:58] Wool_story: @Soraffe Is that the server that also charges a monthly irl payment to own a business?
[3:09:58] Kiddersteve: yeah they were monitoring streams
[3:09:59] Seriphax: Wild has some weird rules around crime, too, and no DoJ
[3:10:02] JWM0420: another thing in roleplay that bothers me is the "run from cops in a car. lose them for a short time. go to mechanic shop and paint it a new color. continue to drive around in the car you just lost the cops in bc it magically changed colors in 12 seconds
[3:10:05] Ziaoko: very public rp server antics
[3:10:05] greeedly: @Meatyfrog LUL
[3:10:06] fatbot2004: OTC meta but they come across like there's so much better than that
[3:10:13] CENSOR_FREE_THOUGHT: isnt that good though?
[3:10:26] babalone_: some of the stuff on ignite was the best rp or the most toxic shit ive ever seen lol
[3:10:30] DudeWheresMyTARDIS__: SOE penetrator
[3:10:32] rummsdiebumms: fam rp was drama pure
[3:10:33] fatbot2004: You still made one of the greatest characters on their entire server with a little more than nothing
[3:10:40] Kiddersteve: the admins got really nitpicky
[3:10:43] OnlineDatabase: the RP on TFRP was really incredible though, that was my favorite server to watch so far
[3:10:45] fatbot2004: I mean he was a homeless man
[3:10:45] Meatyfrog: @CENSOR_FREE_THOUGHT if all parties are fine with the exchange, and don't report and selectively ban your "enemies" then no
[3:10:49] EyelessWolf: yeah
[3:10:50] B1n4ryGaming: do as i say not as i do... TFRP lost its fun for me because of that
[3:10:51] BoDizzle05: but thats the funny stuff
[3:10:54] Koolkid_x23x: damn I miss the Family RP days
[3:10:54] iambqb: @CENSOR_FREE_THOUGHT It makes it so streaming is self reporting, where non streamers will never get that level of scrutiny
[3:10:54] jkestey: Role play over rule play
[3:11:00] SpaceSquidElder: does ignite even exist any more?
[3:11:03] Pyro_Paul3: But that's the thing admins don't learn from other RP server failures they don't be seeing what work and don't work on other servers WutFace
[3:11:04] charlieblossom: NP is a big echo chamber rn too sentryFBM
[3:11:11] Meatyfrog: @SpaceSquidElder yes
[3:11:21] Meatyfrog: @charlieblossom Sadge
[3:11:30] CENSOR_FREE_THOUGHT: @Meatyfrog @iambqb thats true i guess but rule breaking is still against the rules right, which i would think is good for the health of the server, but i could be wrong
[3:11:31] MackManGG: With Wild, if you weren't buddy/buddy with the admins you were gonna struggle due to rule break that they only found due to it being streamed or videographic proof
[3:11:36] Sohu: OhMyDog
[3:11:44] Koolkid_x23x: RP is like real life no one is perfect
[3:11:45] theglizzykisser: bro is grinding
[3:11:46] Ziaoko: no headlights 60 mph into the dirt LUL
[3:11:47] fatbot2004: Maybe I'm just wrong but I feel like good RP is more about creating comical moments and not trying to imitate reality
[3:11:47] gvwolf: sentryHB charbLighter
[3:11:59] Cell_Block_LOL: awesome date 4Head
[3:11:59] MysteryOfABloodRedRose: GIGACHAD
[3:12:00] AndyAndyXD: LUL
[3:12:01] babalone_: im a huge onx supporter so i am  hopeful based on this servers management but we shall see
[3:12:01] Antalissa: lol
[3:12:01] wolfjager935: LUL LUL
[3:12:02] DadlyShadow: LUL
[3:12:02] jovansjj: You should snoop
[3:12:03] Idsertian: Chief broke bad? Noooo... NotLikeThis
[3:12:05] EyelessWolf: @MackManGG or maybe takes time to do
[3:12:06] Noir_PI: master chief and cortana
[3:12:07] jovansjj: Clip that!
[3:12:10] jarrodbruner: I've seen the sex scene in Gone in 60 seconds
[3:12:21] rummsdiebumms: where is lil snitch when you need him :D
[3:12:22] Kiddersteve: @CENSOR_FREE_THOUGHT I dont think it is healthy, definetly not the way Ignite did it. Nitpicking small mistakes.
[3:12:26] carcool12: event in 1 hour?
[3:12:30] jkestey: The couple that robs together stays together
[3:12:33] Pyro_Paul3: But admins don't be learning from other RP servers downfalls like do they even a knowledge it?
[3:12:39] jovansjj: Did you ever get that girl from roach last night? Lol
[3:12:41] whens__lunch: Mrmoon went mia
[3:12:41] EyelessWolf: yeah
[3:12:48] BoDizzle05: kind of boring too
[3:12:51] Meatyfrog: @CENSOR_FREE_THOUGHT in the cases identified by Sentry, it was selective punishment for people's "enemies" and "good rp" wasn't punished, also in the same breath "good rp" is whoever were in the admin's friend group
[3:13:04] jovansjj: sentryLUL sentryLUL sentryLUL
[3:13:05] rummsdiebumms: @whens__lunch we saw him at roachs motel a few days ago
[3:13:24] fatbot2004: And you totally did that the night that you and Roach ran off collected guns and made it back to the jail before anybody noticed..
[3:13:25] BenjiMyDude: Roach community has been everywhere but the roach recently
[3:13:33] babalone_: i will say i fucking miss ron or any other ron type character around
[3:13:34] EyelessWolf: GTA was always like that
[3:13:41] AndyAndyXD: I'm in room 6!! https://clips.twitch.tv/CulturedStylishOwlUnSane-8suDVC_X0WeKw_NF
[3:13:54] carcool12: should you tell people about it or rely on the advert?
[3:13:56] Pyro_Paul3: That's a good thing they're not stationary all the time SeemsGood
[3:14:05] jovansjj: How did he get ownership of a whole hotel?
[3:14:05] GizmoMCs: with the businesses stuff coming in ppl been way more spread out it seems
[3:14:09] GudderSnipe: think moon wants to wait for more interesting progress
[3:14:15] JWM0420: @censor_free_thought but then it also becomes a situation where only streamers get punished bc they have clips and vids to watch. when factually the same amount of rule breaking comes from non streamers
[3:14:16] MysteryOfABloodRedRose: the snake RP was one of my favorite but it probably took a ton of planning to do
[3:14:20] AndyAndyXD: I feel like we need a short bus just to listening with the radio shit talk during the race!!
[3:14:56] theglizzykisser: 15k EZ
[3:15:06] Kiddersteve: @AndyAndyXD good point
[3:15:23] Pyro_Paul3: People don't advertise a lot of things on here
[3:15:25] JWM0420: anyone have taco food trucks just around them
[3:15:33] JWM0420: I feel like that shit would be gas.
[3:15:33] jovansjj: I mean... How would ppl know where the food truck are. If they don't advertise
[3:15:33] MackManGG: Any thoughts on day shift this week or not so much?
[3:15:38] Gilly1984: It's good that both Onyx and NoPixel aren't rushing content out tbf
[3:15:42] DadlyShadow: @JWM0420 got be careful, them ghosts be about, unseen yet watching
[3:15:42] jonathanlorenzo7: TAXI
[3:16:18] liitty_savage: officers davis when
[3:16:29] Jindsu: Sentrys on hell yeah
[3:16:36] fatbot2004: That gatekeeped
[3:16:39] carcool12: @liitty_savage this davis is a comedian
[3:16:50] dreamsofbunnies: Its weird food trucks don't advertise, it's like how else can you find the food trucks?
[3:17:21] ChineseVendor: all this is telling me is that D10 is the greatest rp server
[3:17:45] liitty_savage: oof i love a good laugh dry humor or dark
[3:17:48] Meatyfrog: I've watched 0 minutes of NP 4.0
[3:17:55] GizmoMCs: in the end what realy makes the servers are the people playing on them
[3:17:56] Noir_PI: i feel like the only place i can find super serious slowburn is red dead servers
[3:18:17] BoDizzle05: is there any tricks you do to keep in the right character? (voice change/sayings/personality) or just something you learned?
[3:18:22] EyelessWolf: yeah
[3:18:32] g8rhead: monopolies breed stagnancy
[3:18:35] c0ff33man: I play in a small community like 10 guys and we have so much fun doing rp
[3:18:43] BoDizzle05: you're that character?(kiind of)
[3:19:03] maveclown0709: How does joining a server work? Do you have to find a way in through someone already in them? Also, are you given a role when you join and you need to build off of that? Or just create your character based on how you want to play?
[3:19:12] BoDizzle05: i mean, like you between all your characters
[3:19:35] Moobot: Thank you for subscribing to SilentSentry TS_SS! bleedPurple
[3:19:42] MackManGG: Look at the DUG days. All those people were immersed as all hell. Fun until it wasn't fun and the server fell apart
[3:19:42] MechEng360: is server full?
[3:19:43] TS_SS: TS_SS subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 25 months! 
[3:19:43] Moobot: It's time to throw up some !HYPE - @TS_SS has now subscribed for over 2 years! 25 months - Thank you bleedPurple
[3:20:00] BoDizzle05: yeah, kind of like dnd creating a story
[3:20:10] BoDizzle05: sorry to detour
[3:20:36] rawking7732: sentryHey sentryHey sentryHey  whats good everyone
[3:21:00] DudeWheresMyTARDIS__: its a good deck
[3:21:03] MackManGG: @maveclown0709 You have a blank canvas and you have to paint a masterpiece that will be entertaining to a group of people.
[3:21:05] maveclown0709: That's cool. I feel like I'd enjoy a good role play game, just never looked for one and doubt if be able to find time to give it the attention needed.
[3:21:06] Moobot: Thanks for subscribing to SilentSentry SturmSauer! bleedPurple bleedPurple
[3:21:07] SturmSauer: SturmSauer subscribed at Tier 1. 
[3:21:10] xDERTx: i miss the lil rapping dude
[3:21:12] MsApplebee: @rawking7732 Slow night so far.  KonCha
[3:21:12] InVe1n: just glad ur rpin
[3:21:30] Pyro_Paul3: Yeah like Charlie with windsong and Dee SeemsGood
[3:21:55] Sakkra4: it is like pre WOTC D&D. You had to RP your character.
[3:22:14] GizmoMCs: for this server from what i've seen it realy helps having different chars for when things are slow for one
[3:22:18] SturmSauer: Penta viewer here, I’ve really enjoyed your stream. it’s like a podcast.
[3:22:20] fatbot2004: Seems like too much work.. I'm just going to stick to watching you.. sentryPC sentryPC sentryPC
[3:22:23] BenjiMyDude: New character for new experiences
[3:22:24] Oxhammer: Essentially ketchup is ketchup, and mustard is mustard. Never shall the two meet.
[3:22:41] bladedge28: o hey I made the father or brother or son of this character that I made
[3:22:42] DudeWheresMyTARDIS__: GTAVI RP holyshit
[3:22:42] Pyro_Paul3: Also your character shouldn't just know everything. Know how to drive where the drug spots are etc NotLikeThis
[3:22:44] MackManGG: @maveclown0709 that is the issue. If you aren't able to be active often, it is a struggle because you will fall behind on the story you need to create
[3:23:07] GizmoMCs: pentawPain
[3:23:23] MysteryOfABloodRedRose: @Oxhammer mango curry > mustard NODDERS
[3:23:24] Oxhammer: PeepoComfy
[3:23:30] MackManGG: You have to be able to compartimentalize your brain to different characters.
[3:23:32] fatbot2004: Really good characters on roleplay servers are boring
[3:23:46] liitty_savage: have you looked for any good comedy clubs
[3:23:59] theglizzykisser: could use that sanitation guy
[3:24:08] torijinosa: having special quirks is cool, like feinting at the sight of blood or some shit, adds extra flair to the RP
[3:24:17] subsistcyber: Roleplay has had some amazing moments for me, for sure.
[3:24:27] BoDizzle05: did the mafia turn into any work?
[3:24:30] Sakkra4: like the Dwarf who barely tolerates the party and is always grumbling about this or that...but when push comes to shove the Dwarf will lay down his life for the party.
[3:24:52] tokinsmurf: should keep an eye on your coin if you havent recently, sentry, iss goin up right now, prolly till april
[3:24:52] Pyro_Paul3: I understand sidelining your character if they get seriously injured but for the whole stream though WutFace
[3:25:13] HankJMoody: Can't even drive a short bus like a professional!
[3:25:13] MysteryOfABloodRedRose: only nerds would want that
[3:25:25] DudeWheresMyTARDIS__: but its a superhero server bro
[3:25:37] Noir_PI: having a ton of drawbacks and weaknesses is so fun
[3:25:42] Pyro_Paul3: As cool as little squirt is he can't pull females SeemsGood LUL
[3:25:50] Syrkle13: LUL
[3:26:06] BoDizzle05: the grind is the fun
[3:26:18] MackManGG: That sounded like NP with the huge streamers....
[3:26:22] fatbot2004: The same day you joined the server I watched maybe the biggest roleplay streamer and carried through three separate car chases in different vehicles to get away from the police..
[3:26:30] Pyro_Paul3: And typically people ain't going to want to RP with a overpowered character on their side typically LUL
[3:26:31] tokinsmurf: the fun is the strugg;e
[3:26:32] Dirtyraidersfan: up down up down left right left right select
[3:26:41] DestroyerDarkmass: Davis is far too open.
[3:26:55] bladedge28: My DM has us in a highpower game where we got some high stats but the thing is he's throwing shit he never gets to us at us and his shit is even more over powered. and it's been fun as hell
[3:27:05] jovansjj: That the problem with gamers today. There is no fun if you play a game with cheats, or min maxing everything, or glitching. Kills the fun
[3:27:06] Soraffe: The thing I'm hating is when these big time streamers get to be the admins of the server because they tend to favor their groups for RP creativity
[3:27:18] subsistcyber: It's hard to try out certain roles IRL - roleplay is a fun place to wear different hats.
[3:27:23] matthewmc90: You should be a teacher but not some conventional teacher. You have the ability to connect with people, though bluntly, it's a type of blunt that doesn't come across as hurtful.
[3:27:28] BoDizzle05: they need someone to start a food truck
[3:27:31] Battleliquor: can you advertise that you're looking for a Truck?
[3:27:32] fatbot2004: It's not like they're even good they're just being carried by people that have the best equipment in the game
[3:27:52] MsApplebee: Might role WD40 and get a junker car and drive like a drunk trying to find baking soda. Get some good cop/jail roleplay. That would be easy fallback charter when it’s slow.  TPFufun

[5:32:07] JWM0420: I think the issue with the case is part of the established ID would be your voice bc you did speak to the cop. but idk, we will see

[5:33:37] Idsertian: @SilentSentry Can always claim you saw the guy breaking into the car, and was checking the trunk to see if he'd left anything behind before the cops arrived, that's why talked to the cop. As for evading, you got scurred.

[5:37:22] JWM0420: @idsertian it's a tough case. needs to hurt the expert witnesses credibility by establishing difficulty in their ability to ID based on two separate factors, voice and visual.
[5:37:40] JWM0420: so visual is easy bc you just need to prove a lot of people can look like Davis

[5:39:45] Ka0t1c1985: sentryBurn
[5:40:43] JWM0420: @k0d3r_ DA will just ask how the ID was established and the second the cop says the perp that looked like Davis had his exact voice the look alike thing won't be enough. you'd need someone who sounds enough like Davis
[5:41:00] K0D3R_: @JWM0420 No, Sentry literally told the first cop his name.
[5:41:22] JWM0420: they had met before
[5:41:37] JWM0420: and have met since.

[5:42:29] JWM0420: there is a lot more to it than what could have been a random dressing like Davis and dropping his name
[5:42:34] dreamsofbunnies: I don't think he gave the cop his id, he just ran
[5:42:52] JWM0420: like looking like a person is easy to do. sounding exactly like them is not
[5:43:18] JWM0420: @dreamsofbunnies Davis and that cop met before that interaction at some point previous I'm pretty sure

[5:46:26] dreamsofbunnies: @jwm0420 I figured it was registration of the rental to his I'd?
[5:47:04] Ryu_XIII: when you need to contract a homeless man to defecate in your neighbours petunias
[5:47:08] JWM0420: @dreamsofbunnies I think the cops could take a rental plate and go figure out who it is rented to but it doesn't pop up the same way like the owner does
[5:47:32] dreamsofbunnies: @jwm0420 possible
[5:47:39] K0D3R_: @dreamsofbunnies It is, which is confirmable by the agency that rented the vehicle. Sentry also literally told the first officer on scene his real name.
[5:48:10] dreamsofbunnies: @k0d3r_ right I was saying he didn't show id
[5:48:18] JWM0420: ^ yeah, they have to talk to PDM people to figure it out
[5:48:53] K0D3R_: @dreamsofbunnies Nah no ID shown, but looks, voice, name - not hard to prove guilt lol
[5:49:19] JWM0420: I think they were saying those were from the tampered car
[5:49:24] dreamsofbunnies: Yea that's what we were trying to figure out
[5:49:27] K0D3R_: you switched the rental plates to the car you were driving though LUL
