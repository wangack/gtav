[9:05:12] BertieG: Pawn: 1 point (or pawn) Knight: 3 points. Bishop: 3 points. Rook: 5 points. Queen: 9 points.
[9:05:14] Krustykrista: oh uhnHug good morning chat

[9:05:40] Nightbot: @tahir181 -> uhnChad Get fricked, NURD >:) [Caps] [warning]
[9:05:40] syneesia: The point values tho would be like to big of a space for queen no?
[9:05:44] Smoke_Cohhilition: yes Divy a big unlock about an hour ago; they found a new USB and hack basically
[9:05:44] boajxc: well i get on youtube to see a chess hack what is this progress im missing
[9:05:45] kuronorah: tbh ive never heard of chess things having point value
[9:05:46] syneesia: Too
[9:05:49] kirstarchia: Queen's are traps
[9:05:51] KeepItFraiche: mate in 3 uwuHMM
[9:05:52] FlametrowerOP: i think is pawn 1, horse 2, bishops is 3
[9:05:57] alnds_: they have points in blitz
[9:05:57] speeddemon2k: there go just just a different image over the numbers
[9:06:00] fluffy_smoochee: yup
[9:06:01] wondervviener: or easy for you
[9:06:06] RezaQ8: Queens would be traps if it is 9
[9:06:08] TheRarePotato: what are horses then if 3 worked for Freddy
[9:06:10] wendigo172: Remember chat, OG is always right
[9:06:11] charlieboyx: king me NOW
[9:06:11] wondervviener: you just have to analyze what assigns what and do the normal hack
[9:06:11] syneesia: It makes it easy for you since you're used to numbers
[9:06:11] Taurex: if that's the case you can't use queens
[9:06:15] Azhogh: Isn't it like the hack you do ? if they become numbers in your mind ?
[9:06:17] Kermitthefrog026: Ez for our GEN GOD
[9:06:17] bearrynice: @kuronorah that's why you get +1 etc when you play chess
[9:06:19] ItsBillz: Points value doesnt make sense because 9 for queen doesnt work
[9:06:23] CensoredTH0ughTs: julio's idea is how i thought it worked
[9:06:28] jopememama: queens might be the 7s in this hack LUL
[9:06:29] ItsBillz: I agree with julio
[9:06:30] tombovard: OMEGALUL
[9:06:37] Smoke_Cohhilition: queen might be the new 7
[9:06:38] syneesia: 9 would be impossible
[9:06:42] NapkinAF: is this new hack for the code?
[9:06:42] xGameShock: it's like the hacking tool. the idea just different symbols instead of always letters and numbers

[9:07:29] syneesia: Stop ruining it by progressing Madge
