[0:30:33] iDiversify: it will get worked out eventually stay strong noraexL @NoraExplorer
[0:30:34] WabbitTwouble: @NoraExplorer You could test to shut down the stream and check if it gets better and check OBS out
[0:30:38] jerrybear_: SAJ
[0:30:39] mavericks312: OBS could 100% be the
[0:30:39] nomoreheroes__: yes GPU usage should be 90 percent plus
[0:30:45] guzeriz: @iDiversify its not server isue
[0:30:49] Tcmasterzzz: Have you tried 60 hz?
[0:30:49] Flashkun: PepeLaugh
[0:30:50] LokiTheElusive: Is your OBS encoder GPU or CPU?
[0:30:53] y0whateverdude: Hospital too no?
[0:30:54] lgnashevich: oh yeah this is shaders issue
[0:31:00] iishie_: why is everyone saying it obs? @NoraExplorer does it still lag offline?
[0:31:04] SkenderPig: @LokiTheElusive good question
[0:31:05] AgadhiTheGreat: It's got to be the amount of assets that's being added to ppl's houses
[0:31:07] LokiTheElusive: Swtich to NVENC on OBS if you aren't already
[0:31:09] Kryorgin: whats your encoder in obs ? x264 or nvenc ? should be nvenc @NoraExplorer
[0:31:10] TwinTailsRyu: LUL
[0:31:12] SleepyPandaRL: @NoraExplorer your gpu usage is at 20% you said?
[0:31:12] khlcsl: was it good when you were in the car with V earlier?

[0:31:15] VobleUK: it was fine here with the stream off though wasnt it?
[0:31:18] SeaNostra: @LokiTheElusive this is might be the most probable cause honestly
[0:31:18] Dumi90: try coming southside offstream
[0:31:20] Tenivir: AgadhiTheGreat then it wouldnt only affect Nora this much
[0:31:20] mitko17: New house Pog
[0:31:20] guzeriz: @AgadhiTheGreat its not vee and eugene not laging
[0:31:22] its_AliZ: u need to cap ur fps on 60fps it will help
[0:31:25] Essel: What is your cpu and gpu usage? GPU should be like 90+ and cpu should be pretty low
[0:31:25] Slide1: Chatting  have you tried putting it on rice

[0:31:48] WabbitTwouble: go offline right now
[0:31:49] peterx_14: it has to be OBS settings
[0:31:49] gruegd: Might have to try shutting down OBS and see if the problems go away. Then you know exactly what the problem is.
[0:31:50] SeaNostra: then its obs
[0:31:52] fewe___: CHANGE ENCODER
[0:31:53] Sivvii_: it has to be obs
[0:31:54] DarkRedr: @NoraExplorer then it's OBS

[0:32:00] LokiTheElusive: @NoraExplorer Make sure your Encoder on OBS is NOT "Software x264" and IS NVENC it might fix it
