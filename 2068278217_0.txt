[2:00:37] L1v1T: my knowledge of RP and IRL is a bit blurred
[2:00:55] Darkprince559: Co worker brother got hit at work in her chest and went to the hospital then told they were fine then died with internal bleeding
[2:00:56] stiltz21: I dunno I miss the random Pred or other interactions.  I so rarely ever see you randomly on anyone else’s stream.  Having a social gathering point had some benefits

[2:02:07] nanara_: Malpractice is the scariest thing. You're SUPPOSED to be able to trust doctors, yet you sometimes can't.
[2:02:18] redvipor: Doctors oversees alot which is scary
[2:02:28] L1v1T: @nanara_ It's not even just malpractice, if they arent knowingly wrong, but ik what you mean
[2:02:31] P_Natsu: When I heard secondary drowning, it sounds more like a case of dry drowning. Which means the water has already entered in the lungs and didn't get expelled in time. So it became eventually suffocation from the water trapped in the windpipe
[2:02:32] theySheShe: i had a baby cousin die of sids last year. it’s actually terrifying to think about
[2:02:42] Falconari: oh damn

[2:03:26] AquaBerryBackFist: like would the average person be screaming in pain?
[2:03:33] L1v1T: Usually anytime I go to a doctor, regardless I try to get a 2nd opinion elsewhere
[2:03:37] redvipor: @theysheshe i studied child dev its pretty scary and sad to first learn about it BibleThump
[2:03:40] winterpillows: my sister & mother said the appendix surgery hurts a lot
[2:03:54] nyanskis: something like lower left or something similar
[2:04:30] CaityKat8: appendix surgery nowadays is just keyhole surgery.
[2:04:39] Falconari: ashlolMonka ashlolSad

[2:06:10] redvipor: Geezus
[2:06:12] frodoshairyfeet: Everyone here had an apendix surgery monkaW am i next ?
[2:06:16] AquaBerryBackFist: the most painful surgery i've ever had was a root canal with an abscess Aware

[2:06:44] nyanskis: my root canal was easy peasy, but the whole nerve was dead af lmfao
[2:06:47] zessi8: My grandmother was really sick and the doctor said it was a stomach bug. The next day she was sent to the hospital and she had sepsis. It was to late unfortunately . So many doctors are sloppy
[2:06:52] cubfan1991: doctors told me I never drank soda again
[2:06:55] he1s3nb3rgg: @frodoshairyfeet monkaSHAKE maybe
[2:07:03] CaityKat8: was also released from hospital less than 12 hours after coming out of surgery
[2:07:25] Darkprince559: Ohh my gaming buddy just got her tonsils removed like 6 days ago or something like that
[2:07:31] AquaBerryBackFist: @zessi8 sorry to hear that
[2:07:33] P_Natsu: I think the worst pain I've ever felt was toe fracture from literally crashing my bicycle into a pole
[2:08:02] nyanskis: i have to get my wisdom teeth out soon and have to go to an oral surgeon because theyre hooked onto my molars ashlolNoTalkMe

[2:09:16] nyanskis: @nanara_ surprisingly not super uncommon!
[2:09:25] P_Natsu: I was lucky to only have 1 wisdom tooth removal. Although said tooth grew sideways and the gumflap was the main cause of pain back then
[2:09:52] nyanskis: little tiny mouth club!! they took out 4 molars when i got braces
[2:10:03] redvipor: Im planningnto get braces and im not looking forward to it BibleThump
[2:10:12] AquaBerryBackFist: this is a classic
[2:10:14] frodoshairyfeet: Did you know that sneezing applies ~3g of pressure on you ?
[2:10:17] theySheShe: i’m scared if my wisdom teeth ever grow in. i have a baby tooth that never grew in cuz my jaw is too small
[2:10:28] CaityKat8: @p_natsu yeah toe breaks aren’t fun. I broke the one closest to my big toe last year after a child size wooden chair fell on it. I was in a moon boot for a month or so.
[2:10:28] frodoshairyfeet: Thats almost the same as F1 drivers feel while turning
[2:10:30] Akaishiroi: never had a problem with wisdom teeth
[2:10:37] AquaBerryBackFist: YAPPP
[2:10:43] redvipor: LUL
