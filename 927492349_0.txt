[2:33:17] RezaQ8: @DevilsDescent That is the idea though I thought
[2:33:18] syneesia: Tbf DW and koil only seems bad from HOA perspective, from the other groups they are like sugar daddies KEKW

[2:34:22] Drax_1X: commission seems somewhat fair

[2:37:15] dr_enthusiatick: working at the tavern would also offer safety like not being robbed on your way to and from fishing and you can't get arrested like with crim jobs

[4:21:07] Crit_c: How much were locals paying per bag when cornering?

[4:21:46] zeddsnotdead__: Think the devs don't want the people buying meth to make shit tons of money reselling on the streets, maybe want it used for crime, gang shit etc.

[4:48:23] SUP2U1: @easedel obviously LUL but still like james said there is some else to it so maybe if they get it to certain rating it could have addition effects that makes the selling price go up

[4:57:22] SUP2U1: i feel that you can sell the key but do so with a contract so another group can test it out and see if they find something new, the contract will allow you access to keys even though the other group owns them. IDK
[4:57:22] TaroTartare: 20 per batch is so low, I was thinking it was higher KEKW
[4:57:23] Niney_Who: Imagine having to buy like 4 batches of Meth to "Buy in" to addicting a zone
