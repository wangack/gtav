[1:33:25] skender1: 1 month in and people already have busted S tier cars
[1:33:38] Trubbel: @arrogant_roleplay there was another version of fivem at first, which got taken down cause it was using code from rockstar, later on another group continued making fivem from scratch
[1:33:44] phinvincible: AWD cars are crazy uphill in gta as well
[1:33:50] pechamz: @catheterizedeye oh
[1:33:59] phinvincible: yeah electric cars are busted IRL as well LUL
[1:34:02] pechamz: compared to the cops cars i think is the argument

[1:34:43] xjulesm: p100d with ludicrous+ mode ez
[1:34:46] Macmerlin408: Slow
[1:34:49] pechamz: yeah
[1:34:53] southspoon007: yeah limited
[1:34:53] arrogant_roleplay: yeah
[1:34:54] Hobbsen: theoretic the same
[1:34:55] BakinPacman: they are slow for safety mostly
[1:34:56] phinvincible: looks slower tbh
[1:34:56] Ai_and_Chill: the rivian lets you accelerate at 100% speed
[1:34:58] pechamz: its limited with computer
[1:35:04] Ai_and_Chill: reverse i mean
[1:35:06] horsingaround858: in theory you can flip phase wires and reverse moytor directiomn but yah they limit with the ecu
[1:35:15] phinvincible: the grip gachiBASS
[1:35:22] m4rshan: r these automatic?
[1:35:33] Tokens210: isnt one of the fastest accel car irl still that 1 tesla roadster, its like 0-100 in 3 seconds flat, only cars faster are usually super car companies
[1:35:39] RogueSimulant: Was it the Hellcat that had crazy top end speed?
[1:35:44] Barnes603: chodieTHINK
[1:35:59] BakinPacman: so electric cars are the rat route cars
[1:36:01] TheBeefster: bruh why is it so fast lol
[1:36:03] Jaster_Reylu: for now.... till cops start upgrading too
[1:36:06] BakinPacman: zip and zoom
[1:36:09] pechamz: might be harder with heli to escape with it
[1:36:23] Ryaht: isnt it time for cops to get better cars?
[1:36:24] Vincheti: yeah im glad the server is more realistic
[1:36:24] BeeEzRadio: can we please get a unicycle
[1:36:25] horsingaround858: @Tokens210 nope, college kids built something much fgaster
[1:36:25] shogunlexx: @RogueSimulant yes but i guess it had bad handling
[1:36:29] pouvers: oh that's nerfd nerfd
[1:36:31] phinvincible: it tops out at like 110 as well, it seems pretty fair
[1:36:31] Diplomatics: It is pretty fast
[1:36:33] pouvers: holy shit
[1:36:34] differentendzstream: @koil open everything and stop and see how quick it cools down or turn off and on engine and see how quick it cools down, last time X tried it was instant cooled
[1:36:36] Tokens210: your top speed look like 120-130 ish to so top speed and overheat balances the accel
[1:36:38] ShiftyD84: it was stolen, bruv 2Head
[1:36:41] pechamz: thats fair
[1:36:42] dikstikler: what happens when it overheats
[1:36:47] mynameismikeyd: biggest issue right now is the cops cant repair their engines, so even a balanced new car is better than the beat up police cars they have the moment. some police cars get stuck in first gear for like 8 seconds
[1:36:53] TheBeefster: how come the brand new bmw sentinel does like 90 but this smokes it
[1:36:57] Macmerlin408: Honestly surprised it doesn't break the engine like reel overheating
[1:37:02] ProxyFrog: open the hood
[1:37:03] Drakoncheto_: does restarting the car still reseting the heat? @koil
[1:37:04] ProxyFrog: LUL
[1:37:11] Barnes603: Saw 170mph a couple times so far
[1:37:12] marvelo: carry a watering can NODDERS
[1:37:13] ProxyFrog: cool the engine

[1:37:27] thebigjhn: oof
[1:37:30] PsychoBKilla: Oh interesting
[1:37:31] xjulesm: would be cool if the electrics were affected by snow and rain
[1:37:36] hobhobb: open hood saw someone doing that
[1:37:37] BakinPacman: small bug
[1:37:38] horsingaround858: @Jaster_Reylu to a degree
[1:37:50] pechamz: good catch
[1:37:52] TheBeefster: if you open all doors it cools it downm
[1:37:52] adamaten: dinkDonk Sincere
[1:37:53] BakinPacman: not too egregious
[1:38:01] TheLurkingOne: chatt

[1:38:10] Onelook394: CHADDING
[1:38:10] BeeEzRadio: please add a unicycle
[1:38:13] differentendzstream: Did you check that hellcat already?
[1:38:14] thebigjhn: guys did you not just watch him prove that isnt the case and its a ui bug
[1:38:22] BakinPacman: the turbo mary put on her car made a massive top end difference LUL
[1:38:25] pechamz: @dikstikler no shit thats a audi r8
[1:38:30] BeeEzRadio: THIS
[1:38:31] Macmerlin408: Hellcat
[1:38:31] Mr_Sweetleaf: ContentCheck
[1:38:41] GapzLT: a car you were going to add
[1:38:42] m4rshan: i think a sultan will still beat most electrics... i think it does 160 without turbo
[1:38:44] windstaff54: you said a car was bugged
[1:38:45] CMN__Demon: yooo
[1:38:46] arrogant_roleplay: you were gonna show us your pussy

[1:39:16] BakinPacman: everything gets fine tuned eventually
[1:39:33] Drakoncheto_: another car maybe?
[1:39:33] pechamz: audi r8 can go up to 200mph so i would say the 9f is nerfed
[1:39:49] phinvincible: the Koil Raiden Pog
[1:39:54] windstaff54: car you wanted to add yesterday, was bugged, wanted to check if it was fixed thats what you said
[1:40:02] tigerland06: is this the one that goes fast in reverse?

[1:40:47] jameswoa: Bro driving a glorified hairdryer
[1:40:51] pechamz: the bj was faster
[1:40:57] arrogant_roleplay: The whole "overheating" thing should be lowered a little bit, to me it looks like it takes 5 mins for it to overheat, a little bit annoying ;P @koil
[1:41:09] humidafire: Pog
[1:41:10] King_Rexy: Pog
[1:41:11] BakinPacman: the bj probably will flip alot easier with body roll
[1:41:13] despicablewebb: 5.0 mustang or is it an older model
[1:41:14] phinvincible: Pog manual mustang
[1:41:14] BadWithNames: he doesn't drive, he doesn't leave the house

[1:41:28] zzZoolex: better question is what cars do you have
[1:41:29] shogunlexx: @koil did you guys also fixed that weird thing that objects on the floor inside a house go down to the basement?
[1:41:33] TheLurkingOne: I just got fucked on a broken driveshaft

[1:42:22] HuntiingB3ar: I mean thats exactly whaT the WRX STI does probs
[1:42:28] Jaster_Reylu: ppl say its busted...but what they mean is... im afraid to buy it and it gets nerfed tomrrow
[1:42:32] phinvincible: @interp_tv brother they dont have a budget to buy cars yet, do you really think the next wave of cars will be as bad as the GTA crown vics?
[1:42:32] smo_17_: This is definitely realistic I don't think people have actual experience with vehicles
[1:42:33] horsingaround858: china  spinny boy + some rods + corn juice = fun time, not a long time
[1:42:36] arrogant_roleplay: sounds gorgeous
[1:42:36] windstaff54: i think people think every car is broken compared to the police vapid lmao
[1:42:37] Tripodmidget: Its because CG were test dirivng cars last night and people seen them in this... so its automatically broken.
[1:42:38] Bl8nkk: put a v8 or v12 in that bitch
[1:42:47] BakinPacman: theres also gonna be lots of mods right?

[1:44:16] ATOHIDAN_: @BakinPacman yes but overtuned
[1:44:20] Ramosslol: X was driving that yesterday and it seemed way faster
[1:44:21] Jaster_Reylu: depends which turbo u use... some turbos are helpin with launch speed..some top end
[1:44:22] Diplomatics: yeah I agree
[1:44:25] Macmerlin408: It'd be interesting to have massive power for quarter mile drag races
[1:44:29] BakinPacman: yeah obv balance matters
[1:44:29] phinvincible: looks great too
[1:44:38] pechamz: @Ramosslol he was on the high way going down a hill with bumbs
[1:44:40] johnbeer1: can u put a turbo in it?

[1:45:27] TheLurkingOne: I feel like you could have 120 indicated changed to like 180 so it isnt moving that fast but says it is

[2:05:53] Bl8nkk: the finger
[2:05:55] Ace0fHz: Bethesda needs to either overhaul the Creation Engine or switch. Overhaul would be better, we don't need every studio using the Unreal Engine 5, no matter how good it is.

[2:42:06] motherfunker2: is that the king?
[2:42:09] greekgodfade: its crazy to see that a month in and people are still finding stuff out. safe to say some things are still untouched?
[2:42:10] Th3Ch0: gib gift frand XD

[2:45:32] n8dogg03: CoolStoryBob
[2:45:37] ShiftyD84: hey bob, what have you done with koil?
[2:45:38] Manston: hi bob koilHi
[2:45:39] greekgodfade: how long you been rping for koil, before nopixel? samp?
[2:45:43] atomic_habit: Who does car balance now ? @koil
[2:45:50] drewbooth44: GOBLIN NOT Bob or Francis
[2:45:58] Supatroopa: think there was something else that made you take more sewer damage
[2:46:03] ShiftyD84: @greekgodfade he made NoPixel Arma too
[2:46:19] RefreshingLemonade: and weewee is bonus
[2:46:21] greekgodfade: oh is Arma where NoPixel originated from?
[2:46:23] Traviz_Gamez: mods may i asked why i got timed out or can i not even ask a question
[2:46:28] PlouffeLuL: @atomic_habit Any dev is able to change handlings meta. Its gotten to a point where editing a vehicle is basic fivem knowledge
[2:46:34] Trubbel: lets not
[2:46:38] Trubbel: even if
[2:46:40] ShiftyD84: @koil i think if it was easier, people would get robbed more than they already do
[2:46:59] Jaster_Reylu: is ur key jingle gone?  cant hear ur cop keys anymore
[2:47:05] madferret10: question did they move the fence to the sewers to reduce the amount of g6/grime robberies or was the fence always intended to be in the sewers?
[2:47:07] TheLurkingOne: @Trubbel my bad
[2:47:09] Luthercorpz: lysPopcorn lysPopcorn lysPopcorn
[2:47:11] Trubbel: all good
[2:47:43] Worlie: the engine swap thing mary was talking about sounds nutts
[2:47:50] Supatroopa: selling a lot of your stuff is smart since people just rip it anyway
[2:47:50] ToyLetTreat: Can we attach an engine to a shopping cart ?
[2:47:52] Ripley: I feel like they have to be heavy to slow down G6 grind - but maybe criminals could have ‚Äúdye packs‚Äù removed from them to lessen the weight
[2:48:07] PlouffeLuL: Scripting and editing meta are two different things but meta are basic knowledge.  After that its code and script design i guess and fivem provides tons of ways to edit vehicles during runtime.
[2:48:09] ShiftyD84: @Traviz_Gamez for meta, and worrying about money, rather than what koil said he was doing it for -- the roleplay
[2:48:10] Jaster_Reylu: if your a fence..... and the cops keep commin around... how long do u stay there
[2:48:34] Diplomatics: How the hell do these sewer rats get all this shit down here LUL  shopping carts and all.
[2:48:39] Walla_x: Tie them together and drag them
[2:48:42] Bacon_Space: Hey chat long time no talk hey Trubbel whipHug
[2:48:46] tsugaru001: Bricks of cash
[2:48:49] Trubbel: heyy
[2:48:53] jonoh_: how did you learn to dev? just self taught?
[2:48:53] PrymeNZ: !bsg
[2:48:54] StreamElements: Don't tell or suggest koil to do things, he doesn't need your help.
[2:48:55] jaceymarsha11: wheel barrow lol
[2:48:56] Supatroopa: use benches to break them down maybe?
[2:49:00] greekgodfade: how did the sewer script come about anyway, was you even aware this was possible before it was done if u know what i mean? because ive never seen anything like this
[2:49:04] Bacon_Space: Trubbel long time no talk am i right üëç
[2:49:40] mynameismikeyd: would be cool if there was a mechaic for the cops where they could "arrest" an NPC for an illegal job when ok'ed by the DOJ and it moves the NPC in real time so it doesnt need to wait till a restart
[2:49:44] PlouffeLuL: For ordinary people assets are scripts koil
[2:49:44] Silushun: I think he means creating the Sewer in General
[2:49:47] proftim42o: proftim42o subscribed at Tier 1.

[2:50:01] Traviz_Gamez: @ShiftyD84 there was no meta involved but ok
[2:50:02] greekgodfade: nah, the ability to make an underground system like this
[2:50:12] PlouffeLuL: Koil dosent know TS he cant code on np OMEGALUL
[2:50:12] greekgodfade: because its pretty insane
[2:50:19] Diplomatics: @greekgodfade it's mostly 3D tbh
[2:50:23] greekgodfade: oh okay
[2:50:26] Jaster_Reylu: franny cant read so thers that
[2:50:30] MasiMaps: Do you know how the map creator for the Sewers made it so they can flood with water? Absolutely blew me away as a map creator when I first saw that happen.
[2:50:34] Supatroopa: is there a lot more to come with the computers?
[2:50:38] ShiftyD84: @Traviz_Gamez telling someone how much something is worth is meta 4Head
[2:50:42] saitokawa: oh thats cool you try and not know
[2:50:47] ShiftyD84: stop shaking your leg OpieOP
[2:50:49] greekgodfade: yeah, ruins the fun if u know the ins and outs of everything
[2:50:52] NarwhalArgy: I hate having to do stuff like that as well
[2:50:54] wasabbi123: Is there any other servers that are copying NP 4.0 scripts, do you try to stop them at all. Cuz those people are dumb as fuck!
[2:50:55] thebigjhn: yup
[2:51:03] TheLurkingOne: @ShiftyD84 Thats his cock
[2:51:10] Lutulente: koilDerp
[2:51:11] thebigjhn: once you learned how to code its all just syntax at that point
[2:51:16] Trubbel: @wasabbi123 ofc there are, and yes dmca
[2:51:17] BlurryPenguin: I'm very bad at initial setup server stuff lol
[2:51:28] thebigjhn: within reason
[2:51:31] Bacon_Space: Hey koil what was your favorite and most proud part of 4.0 you made so far for the server
[2:51:32] PlouffeLuL: Exactly what i said to buddha, once you know a language learning another one is pretty easy.
[2:51:35] Traviz_Gamez: @ShiftyD84 howos that meta  when he know how much they are already in rp
[2:51:37] ThaKrisp: if it works, it works. no one said it was performant KEKW
[2:51:39] Walla_x: WTF did I do? "git reset HEAD --hard" ... ah much better
[2:51:41] greekgodfade: whos the wizard behind all this 3d modelling
[2:52:00] giantdwarf1077: just gettin in here, what are we doing with the bags and in the sewer?
[2:52:03] arrogant_roleplay: ADHD is kicking my ass right now, waiting on my presc to come inn
[2:52:10] ShiftyD84: @Traviz_Gamez you assumed he knows...
[2:52:14] tellan66: why he pronounce nike like that
[2:52:27] thebigjhn: y not
[2:52:32] Bacon_Space: ShiftyD84 how are you ?
[2:52:33] panicduck_: HELLO!
[2:52:33] StreamElements: koilHi
[2:52:38] PlouffeLuL: Bro the ui design copied on cfx forums 2 days after release had me dying ''No Pixel 4.0 inspired'' 2 days later OMEGALUL
[2:52:43] ShiftyD84: @Bacon_Space I'm Shifty
[2:52:44] msav: I DID IT Pepega
[2:52:46] scrappythe1st: Could you put some kind of sewer cart at the bottom of the ladder that you can load up with stuff for the fence?
[2:52:49] LordRitzu: Take a nike logo and turn into an X EZ
[2:52:51] Traviz_Gamez: @ShiftyD84 ok buddy whatever  helps u sleep at night
[2:52:52] MasiMaps: Koil, how does the player houses work? Are they MLO's placed in the buildings, or do the shells only spawn in once the houes is owned?
[2:52:52] stonephone89: nike is short for nichael jordan
[2:52:59] thebigjhn: ohh my y not was for him asking why you said nike like that
[2:53:06] jaceymarsha11: theres aot of shopping trollys down there maybe use one of them to put all bags in
[2:53:10] jaceymarsha11: alot
[2:53:12] Silushun: @koil It's a long ole time a way, but how long estimated do you reckon it'd take for FiveM to turn into SixM?
[2:53:12] Bacon_Space: @ShiftyD84 Lol  been here since start of 2.0 üòÇ
[2:53:13] Chrizs: I found some shady Script Seller that sell alot of "NP Inspired Shit" but its not on their tebex. U need to open a ticket on their discord.
[2:53:19] TheLurkingOne: ctrl c ctrl v 'inspired by' classic
[2:53:22] thebigjhn: <3
[2:53:43] imYurkie: it's like fan art, taking inspiration and creating something new from that is great, Just taking something and being like "ya I did that" is fucked
[2:53:45] Chrizs: Can I somehow provide specific discords to you?
[2:53:48] bigched110: @Chrizs There is a few bro its always going to happen unfortunately
[2:53:52] PlouffeLuL: @TheLurkingOne Now they are using TS only so at least cache dumping is a little less of an issue than before.
[2:53:54] mynameismikeyd: is there a way for viewers to report bugs etc that we see in streams to make the dev's lifes a little easier with getting reports for problems?
[2:54:16] IMkompots: @koil if one would recreate logic with ox inventory to throw props similar to np, would you consider that as infringement?
[2:54:31] iamloyaltytv: Does the no pixel team need graphic designers?
[2:54:35] Chrizs: What would happen to me If I would be so stupid and didnt double check and buy script off of shady guys and It comes out that is from a Server Dump or something?
[2:54:43] TheLurkingOne: @mynameismikeyd I thought about asking but you think they wont get spammed by 2000 7 years olds about 'my streamer'
[2:54:43] ShiftyD84: @Traviz_Gamez we get it -- you don't like roleplay, and it's all about the min/max for you...
[2:54:45] arrogant_roleplay: the whole point of modding is to show your own creativity not copy and paste someshit
[2:54:48] thebigjhn: i hope not i want that everywhere
[2:54:49] greekgodfade: with the backing of rockstar now i can only imagine the potential for RP on the next gta
[2:55:19] LordRitzu: Time to throw PogChamp
[2:55:21] Lutulente: koYEL invented throwing koilDerp
[2:55:38] Silushun: Not kissing booty but... NoPixel just does it better xD
[2:55:41] thebigjhn: no plans on stealing content saving my lawyer monies
[2:55:49] bigched110: Are you planning on releasing any more assets on the NP store mate
[2:55:58] Hachem_HM: could we have a viewer twatter website that has the np twatter feed?
[2:56:00] PlouffeLuL: Most people dumb cache koil, dont forget.
[2:56:01] LordRitzu: In the real world. 90% of everything is a copy of something.
[2:56:02] credic_: why does everyone always wanna copy servers its so weird
[2:56:12] N3TZAH: That's it though "copying nopixel" that's how they'll sell their product
[2:56:14] IMkompots: googling dmca laws in EU is suicide :D
[2:56:25] Traviz_Gamez: lol i enjoy rp but just said seems like a waste of time i know hes doing it for rp but money/time isnt worth
[2:56:31] Jaster_Reylu: alot of people can do the work koil... but not many have the vision? creativity? to think up this shit. ppl are drones
[2:56:34] ATOHIDAN_: people usually copy NP because of how big it is (name) because of the streamers promotions etc. so viewers wants to play something close to NP
[2:56:36] arrogant_roleplay: @koil they only do it because it gives them clicks I guess
[2:56:36] credic_: i get using little ideas here and there but fully copying ui and hud and all is crazy
[2:56:43] z3nn: The reason everyone wants to copy nopixel is because they innovate, but 100 copies of the same ui becomes old fast, why not spend that time being creative and innovate something yourself
[2:56:45] BlurryPenguin: Theres a difference between re-creating something or making something based on something or being inspired by someone and then just copying something.
[2:56:54] Vykenos: I think people are getting copyright and trademark confused
[2:56:57] thebigjhn: yeah its like ford cant tell dodge to not make a truck. But they cant make a truck that looks like a ford.
[2:57:02] Sohu: TwitchConHYPE
[2:57:18] Trubbel: my favourite is when people steal things and leave the watermark in still for everyone to see

[2:57:38] IMkompots: @koil will the static traffic lights and poles be added to np world pack?
[2:57:38] saitokawa: forsenE ON 4.0 SOON
[2:57:41] ShiftyD84: @Traviz_Gamez why do you care so much what someone else does?
[2:57:48] TheLurkingOne: @koil couldnt you put some hidden code or like a trademark into textures?
[2:57:51] xItzSmoke: Sven ?
[2:58:02] credic_: people will spend hours on recreating np stuff or other server stuff when they could make their own and possibly make money off their script if they sold it lol
[2:58:26] LordRitzu: @TheLurkingOne Textures with tons of little "np" letters written all over it OMEGALUL
[2:58:26] TheLk7: Ya you could like just hit them up with a warning email to change and give them the chance
[2:58:34] Diplomatics: Shifty I give you all the credit, that guy would've been gone by now. OMEGALUL
[2:58:37] PlouffeLuL: Thing is people will buy anything thats looking like np design wtv the design is
[2:58:37] giantdwarf1077: @koil do you think they will get laws out for AI copying stuff? getting close to that point where AI will be used to copy stuff as a way around the laws.
[2:58:40] Jaster_Reylu: vinny gave it
[2:58:43] FritsNMae: why did you throw your id on the balcony here?
[2:58:45] Lancent: Didn't Vinny hand it to you
[2:58:49] Dezgotrobbed: me like crack
[2:59:01] greekgodfade: some people just dont have the creative drive to create their own design, even if they have the ability to do it
[2:59:06] greekgodfade: frauds
[2:59:22] Silushun: What made you decide to turn Franny into a Tunnel Dweller?
[2:59:24] credic_: i think the law still applies to ai if it looks the exact same
[2:59:34] IMkompots: is there any pipelin that package subs can expect in future? @koil
[2:59:46] credic_: if u can spend hours doing it for free spend hours making your own u can make money off of easy
[2:59:55] conway013: zoomers
[3:00:12] arrogant_roleplay: @koil its because it gives them clicks to use NoPixel in the name
[3:00:16] greekgodfade: mhmm yeah, i guess
[3:00:25] mofoloco1: your about to roll up on soime shit
[3:00:26] DaddyJ25: It boils down to ppl are lazy.. bottom line it's easier to steal then it is to put in the thought, time, and energy to make their own design...
[3:00:39] mofoloco1: alot of drama happening right no in this house
[3:00:44] credic_: running a server like a business is prolly the best for fivem but theres a lot of shitty business owners out there too....
[3:00:46] jaceymarsha11: @koil did you see the house robbery scuffed dooor
[3:01:07] Trubbel: we dont need or want the drama here
[3:01:09] thebigjhn: CUM
[3:01:12] LordRitzu: YEP CUM
[3:01:12] atomic_habit: U think there is any server close to be in competition with nopixel @koil
[3:01:14] arrogant_roleplay: @jaceymarsha11 yeah lmfao
[3:01:28] arrogant_roleplay: he experienced
[3:01:51] LordRitzu: Can you use poop as the detergent?
[3:02:10] ghostdawg99: take a ride Franny
[3:02:27] greekgodfade: i‚Äôd say no tbh, theres defo servers that are great out there but i couldn‚Äôt but one into comparison w nopixel on terms of the effort / succession @atomic_habit
[3:02:32] aries89: i wonder if gta6 is going to hit you guys up, cause it looks like you guys really know what you're doing with this game, lots of input from the community
[3:02:43] NarwhalArgy: It should be worth noting there is a difference between straight-up stealing vs coding your own version of it.
[3:02:47] jaceymarsha11: @arrogant_roleplay lool so bad they even say aww its locked
