[6:04:22] iamloyaltytv: Robbing people at a spot is shit, but catching someone lacking is RP
[6:04:26] cleanstrikes: @Whippy Your take on robbing G6 at Bay City/Vault?
[6:04:29] Mic_Stargazer: It's too easy to camp a single location imo. The VU Lady even mentions the VU being "location one"
[6:04:34] DB4DKevin: @Whippy even making it look like some other gang did it is more acceptable than masked up voice changer
[6:04:35] xetrovj: perhaps you give too much Sadge
[6:04:46] Mic_Stargazer: Fair I haven't seen it either tbh
[6:04:58] Arnoldbou: your channel is on the front page of twitch for me

[6:05:03] geckoZen: ALOO i think u robbed me, can i have my stuff back pls?
