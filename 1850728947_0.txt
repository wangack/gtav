[5:06:41] amptown27: my family here at home doesnt see drinking as a issue they low key encourage it cause everyone does it. my issue is with moderation. never could find a "healthy" balance while drinking. so i think i just need to stop again.
[5:07:43] HilariousNefarious: Yep, I had to do that with weed. Everyone says it‚Äôs not addictive but it is if you feel like you have to do it daily. I guarantee things will get better if you stop man.
[5:07:44] amptown27: just been stressed since i came back cause i came home to live with my grandpa cause my grandma died and he needed help. and i had to give up alot to come home and now im struggling and resorting back to my old bad habits to"get by" i miss my bud though from portland
