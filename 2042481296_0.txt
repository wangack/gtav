[1:29:55] Vizi797: I was wondering that too.  If you assigned something into a “room” I would imagine it wouldn’t load outside of the house for people.  Which might make it easier to deal with
[1:30:15] tadjh_: tadjh_ subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 21 months! hi kivaHi
[1:30:32] tropictr3: I imagine the rooms help with loading the same way I've seen Dark0 use them on his dev streams
[1:30:46] tropictr3: The LL is filled to the brim with them to help with loading
[1:30:50] Sssaap: but with objects sticking out of rooms you'd probably run into the same issue? unless you start rendering only when you really are in the middle of the room?
