[4:21:57] drfeelgoodtv: Like you do at senior buns ;)
[4:21:58] nippytime: @Naeem2111 not in USA. only if they are large corpo. small corps don't have same laws
[4:22:01] fublian: They cannot force you to work more, and it is not allowed to work more for free basically. But I mean some months I work like 80h a week because of insane overtime etc

[4:23:14] GonSmithe: @TropicalToucan It's good you get paid extra but 60 hour work week is bad for anyone's mental health, that's what the laws are for
[4:23:22] nippytime: in cali it's every hour over 8 for the day is OT
[4:23:48] letsgetdubbed: EMS on a crime scene before police ? Do they not have SOPs yet?
[4:23:57] BlackFireCowboy: not even just mental health, its scientifically proven to lessen your lifespan if you work longer than 40 hour weeks lol
