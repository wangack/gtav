[2:28:20] daskaputtja: I heard there's talks of Ruth being proscuted as well?
[2:28:35] Jeremy9000CS2: @BinkyLea I used to watch cop RP all the time in 2.0 and 3.0, but 4.0 is a little cringe imo
[2:28:35] forfiet: @fatgirldrunk he‚Äôs just an admin
[2:28:37] bigjerry31: never been into pd RP but that cornwood case  and Ks case got me wanting to see how this all ends
[2:28:39] ricter87: !ooc
[2:28:39] Fossabot: OOC is an acronym that stands for out of character. It is often used in role-playing when a person wants to break character. Separation and understanding of OOC and In character (IC) Is very important to the flow of RP.
[2:28:41] Wyborn24: A lot needs changed with the current PD
[2:28:41] highjayare: Don't know if the cops are worse right now cuz they can kind of make up their own laws
