[4:52:45] MackenzieIyer: i feel like insubordination needs a quick response on the field, followed by a follow up with their CoC. You can't allowed insubordination to stand like that
[4:52:54] ichijazz: I really hope Brick and Ingevar transfer just to give Toretti a headache

[4:54:18] RealLifeNoRespawn: fuck these tamales are delicious
[4:54:29] DrBeaubert: Brian's idea was so much simpler. Let HC deal punishments to whoever, and if it's found to be unreasonable after the fact, punish the HC officer for acting out of line

[5:12:43] Moo_Moose: @MackenzieIyer there is always a boss with a final say, if there isn't it won't work. there is always a general in the army and a top in the police, because you can't have multiple positions that make a final decision because if they disagree then it's a infinite loop.
