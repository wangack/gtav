[5:30:17] codyalex1998: I wonder whos gonna be look out since almost everybody is on Mario Kart uhnKek
[5:30:18] isDall: @3spada_Grande yeah but the money isn't coming from people actually paying into the treasure hunt, its from the parks and rec department buying all the mead upfront
[5:30:18] forsteripenguin: itll work if the mead caps can be used for Race Entries
[5:30:18] esrou: It is a good idea if they actually follow through with it. But Kraytor is good at following through
[5:30:30] Lazy_Panda98: Mead and a free AK
[5:30:33] yaboiFenex: i think it could be a good way to kickstart the bottle cap economy as well but with fruit stands hecked rn it all just seems undoable
[5:30:35] TheRarePotato: maybe if you collect one of each mead you win something else but idk what
[5:30:44] Maithiss: @Detoxx3 i forgot because fallout 76 was such a fucking turd i got rusty
[5:30:46] NoManners: in combination with the bottle caps, eventually the mead would be well worth it, for the prize money alone
[5:30:50] SuperHolyCow: I mean if the bottle cap thing is going along with it, theres incentive for a secondary prize, its like 2 events for 1.
[5:30:55] bashuu128: one prize can be bunch of crates
[5:30:56] sutanhazz: mead and a free car (asbo or asea)

[5:53:39] Nuke_Liar: not kid, when the time comes you take something from the person that they didnt know they had,
[5:53:44] Olacarn: Assassin is partly right. Law of Surprise is you get a "thing" that the person didn't expect therefore the surprise bit. Just turns out they didn't expect to have a kid.
[5:53:46] Genetikco: law of surprise is when you get something someone does not expect to have when they get home
