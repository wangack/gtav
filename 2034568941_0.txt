[2:45:41] Fisherinov: i think its just same profiles on different devices no?
[2:45:42] chirashis: 3 buttcoin = 1 mac10
[2:45:43] 87wiz: 4 of the same user wtf?
[2:45:45] bennboy6189: same house different computer?

[2:46:20] luckerooni: yea
[2:46:22] luckerooni: thats weird
[2:46:35] Stepanov370: if wifi needs to be same for operations then it's wifi's mac
[2:46:35] sh4gun: i think i figured it out but ill not say it
[2:46:37] Pike_lol: yeah i get what youre saying, but 2 computers cant have same wallet no?
[2:46:37] JustTomMeh: ye same wallet, diff pc so diff mac address? idk
[2:46:38] kaivaIya: so basically the mac address gets you free mac donalds but if you get a mcdonald and a junior mcchicken it becomes a mcgangbang and its the same amount of food as a normal quarter pounder but way cheaper
[2:46:40] 5Jonny: i think thats it lol

[2:48:02] Ericktf_: they dont have 1 full butc
[2:48:02] chirashis: EZ
[2:48:06] gRi_in: maybe dont have so much
[2:48:10] Chroni9: what if you connected to a differnt wifi using salty does it change at all
[2:48:15] Pike_lol: could have changed by now right? if they are on different wifi?
[2:48:17] WeirdWrinkle: for that money storage thing, it would be epic if he could get an ATM inside the casino to deposit and withdraw money as needed
[2:48:23] Hungover_Pilot: gas for transferring
[2:48:57] SadPeypey: dont have that amount
[2:49:05] Pike_lol: does wifi expire?
[2:49:07] luckerooni: can you send 0 to ping
[2:49:11] brikbeans: pog
[2:49:25] sh4gun: time to bruteforce LUL
[2:49:27] HanterXI: mmm
[2:49:28] Stepanov370: isn't sending to yourself instant?
[2:49:35] luvvkoa: wait does tablets have wifi yet
[2:49:35] brikbeans: now you need second computer on same wifi and try again?
[2:49:36] slurpy824: its time
[2:49:37] Bullhawk: I think it's tied to the PC, you're on a commonly used mac address and no one has taken anything from you/addeed anything to you
[2:49:41] Shone52: what if u send to someone else?
[2:49:48] luckerooni: i see no reason other than it's not actually programmed in that you can't bruteforce
[2:49:51] kalemeadows: does the mac address change if you take a part out?
[2:50:16] 5Jonny: do it
[2:50:17] Stepanov370: try sending from pc1 with wifi1 to pc2 with wifi2
[2:50:17] brayy_dee: then do it
[2:50:17] slurpy824: do it
[2:50:18] 5Jonny: MEGALUL
[2:50:19] bennboy6189: try it
[2:50:20] leekillua111: do it
[2:50:20] veqzei: DO IT
[2:50:21] gRi_in: do it
[2:50:21] luckerooni: idk seems like thats it try stealing some shit
[2:50:22] tuAntonioo: do it
[2:50:23] james3149: do it
[2:50:24] rs_xspartacus: try it
[2:50:26] BoywithVIP: do it
[2:50:27] Monty0x: The mac address is for the WiFi, not for your pc.
[2:50:27] 11moonlighti: do it
[2:50:27] Chroni9: WHY not try ome5
[2:50:29] veqzei: only one way to find out
[2:50:30] onix146: xddBusiness
[2:50:30] Pike_lol: people saying do it. how do you do it?
[2:50:31] HanterXI: now one think like you

[2:50:33] brikbeans: ig cause its sucha time sync
[2:50:34] slurpy824: never gonna know until u try
[2:50:36] brikbeans: true
[2:50:46] nerf000: omieSit
[2:50:46] HanterXI: no
[2:50:48] inyankrak: its the internet connection address, not the wallet address
[2:51:00] inyankrak: its where the wifi is comming from
[2:51:03] Norbisz6: buh
[2:51:03] Monty0x: The mac address is the mac address of the WiFi router
[2:51:07] 1cegem: 24hr pt 2 EZ
[2:51:08] rayhxxn: It's worth the time investment if it works
[2:51:13] tmaestr0: scan for that mac adress with salty and get the ip that way?
[2:51:14] ceekpo: Steal as much as you can and buy all the apps EZ
[2:51:20] Bullhawk: Crypto is stored on the PC not on the Wally app or am I wrong? So how would you get their crypto
[2:51:23] Norbisz6: @Norbisz6  RoxyPotato
[2:51:33] admiralbandit: bla
[2:51:37] pokerspace: All devices connected to a network have mac addresses

[2:51:46] RedaB96: maybe you need Tower Defense
[2:52:03] kalemeadows: maybe they just switched?
[2:52:03] QuimS2: different days different wifis
[2:52:03] TouchFlick: Maybe they change after * times for nerfing brute forcing idk
[2:52:06] Maza_Manny: y
[2:52:06] RedaB96: after storm new wifi ?
[2:52:09] Stepanov370: just test it
[2:52:10] Shone52: different homes?
[2:52:10] veqzei: maybe smokecrack is for hacking and in the future towerdefense will be defending hacks
[2:52:20] hydr0qc: this binance app is def for what your doing
[2:52:23] BoywithVIP: wait where does it all stored in? maybe take it out of the pc and put a new one in?
[2:52:27] inyankrak: different connections, a timestamp would help there
[2:52:31] silverxco_: apparently not make sense as the real thing
[2:52:33] hydr0qc: u on to something mhm
[2:52:33] QuimS2: different wifis omie
[2:52:34] luckerooni: yea oxb8 sends from both c9 and 84
[2:52:36] Angrystomat: whenever i hear that yellow song i just start crying Sadge
[2:52:36] brokenbeam: its just putting all the funds in 1 wallet
[2:52:55] sh4gun: HDD?
[2:52:56] sajenth: maybe cos its a game and it doesn't actually work even if youre right
[2:53:05] Eclipse_292: overthinking it
[2:53:14] brikbeans: if the mac address changes but wifi stays the same wouldt you just send to your mac address once you hack theirs?
[2:53:14] silverxco_: this is like masking ip things
[2:53:15] pokerspace: Maybe ethernet adapter and wireless adapter?
[2:53:15] wedge9099: they connected two separate computers at different locations
[2:53:22] berniehaXX: it's 2 vpns that are linked together, maybe through a same server type shii
[2:53:26] no_q0: LETHIMCOOK
[2:53:27] Kingofswags2003: I think how it works in game is different from irl
[2:53:29] LeCharlesmx: yo omieFlower
[2:53:29] awekiller_4: is the wallet like an account you can log into different wifi connections?
[2:53:36] gargelon69: your thinking is reasonable
[2:53:36] ZedDee: appartment pc and home pc?
[2:53:38] sh4gun: LETHIMCOOK
[2:53:40] RedaB96: how much time a pc stay connected ? because if it happened before and after storm people might ve have to reconnect

[2:53:47] kalemeadows: testing?
[2:53:52] slurpy824: mhm
[2:53:53] 5Jonny: has to be multiple
[2:53:54] hydr0qc: yep
[2:53:57] BoywithVIP: second one
[2:54:00] sh4gun: second
[2:54:04] charredskin: Could it be someone is buying something at someone's house via crypto? They log on their computer/pay, seller happy boom deal.
[2:54:10] BoywithVIP: has to be multiple
[2:54:14] RedaB96: ohhh ok if its more than once idk
[2:54:14] TouchFlick: Would be good to have a timestamp ngl
[2:54:17] Stepanov370: if transactions are possible with different wifis on both ends, then it's confusing
[2:54:18] Maza_Manny: omeh y
[2:54:20] jult: Is this transaction of other players?
[2:54:21] HanterXI: we need yuno
[2:54:22] w0blz: when you open each pc is the wallet different, also when others access do they see anything different
[2:54:22] Monty0x: It costs nothing to change wifi if you have the mac address and ip address of the wifi
[2:54:24] shams267: y
[2:54:28] Eclipse_292: different computers
[2:54:32] brokenbeam: looks exactly like ethereum transactions aside from the mac
[2:54:34] RedaB96: if it was once i would say tsunami or something
[2:54:36] silverxco_: nothing wrong here
[2:54:38] JustTomMeh: yeah there's 4 rows with the same details
[2:54:40] BoywithVIP: could you take out the buttcoin for the pc ?
[2:54:42] wutbroman: y
[2:54:45] BoywithVIP: maybe thats why
[2:54:50] SadPeypey: y
[2:54:51] wedoreally: :3
[2:54:51] Messagge: you really need yuno to help test theories
[2:54:52] shams267: omeh y
[2:54:54] rhythm_sk: npc?
[2:54:55] slurpy824: wait so can u tell which pc theyre sending to?
[2:54:56] Qrucials: Explain why this doesnt make sense: Wally only has access to the PC its running on, and the mac / ip address thing only gives you network access and that's what's showing on Binunce
[2:54:57] bv_hmm: it is probably same network but different devices
[2:55:01] 87wiz: will switching hdd to one of ur other computers tell u something?
[2:55:01] Maza_Manny: Jackass *Is theory-crafting*
[2:55:03] slurpy824: yuno PagMan
[2:55:04] onix146: monkeHmm
[2:55:10] snne_: BatChest call yuno
[2:55:24] luckerooni: need to go through and connect profiles to senders to receivers to macs and process eliminate rip
[2:55:51] Messagge: this is why i always call irl instead of text
[2:55:57] Maza_Manny: Waiting
[2:55:58] luckerooni: it seems like the user profiles and sender addresses are connected so im thinking the sender address is like the public key
[2:55:58] brikbeans: you need to pretend to be a device contributing to access balance and then send balance to your home device...but how?

[3:04:01] boe_103748192: the motherloadian
[3:04:01] exoqqen: its prolly the mac adress of the router u hack into using smokecrack
[3:04:01] Aetholite: Same pc, sending to the same other PC after tsunami
[3:04:03] powerferno1: mac addresses are pretty much local addreses so that switches know where to send packets
[3:04:05] w0blz: miner EXT rack
[3:04:05] qHaydos: sender not reciever
[3:04:07] hyperpopdaiIy: multiple pcs, sending crypto to one account
[3:04:08] qsgold96: HE MEANS ONE PC AS THE MASTER PC THAT HOLDS ALL OF IT
[3:04:09] sharkkiller007: He is right
[3:04:09] Stepanov370: @primetime3213 full sending it
[3:04:41] epc22: 4th and 5th have same MAC address
[3:04:49] turnipss: MAC address isn't the WIFI its the specific computer address
[3:04:50] TouchFlick: Wait did you say the mac adress is the wifi?
[3:04:54] gargelon69: mac is not wifi
[3:04:54] qookies: you are spoofing the MAC address too on smokecrack no? @omie
[3:04:56] connorr_03: mac address is for identifying machines not a network
[3:04:58] shogunlexx: MAC IS FOR THE PC
[3:05:06] datascribe: one thing is what a real mac address is another is what the devs made it to be
[3:05:10] heavydanger: LUL
[3:05:14] Aetholite: MAC address changes every tsunami, addresses stay the same maybe
[3:05:21] ipiv: its not. mac is wifi router's
[3:05:24] SmellyGoatZ: xqcL test
[3:05:25] ipiv: chat stop
[3:05:27] silverxco_: bro thats just original device mac and vpn mac. maybe scuff or intentional
[3:05:29] qHaydos: hes saying the username when ur talking about the sender address
[3:05:32] Hevs: MAC address irl is for devices not for WiFi, for example ur pc has its own specific MAC address
[3:05:34] youngdoodleshawty: so theyre transferring butcoin to a different computer ??

[3:06:08] luckerooni: yea but then you're not mining?
[3:06:08] powerferno1: @youngdoodleshawty basically pcs are part of a subnet
[3:06:25] chakaw667: @luckerooni you dont mine in one, but you can have 10 others
[3:06:27] SmellyGoatZ: HACKERMANS
[3:06:29] entergaymode: aren't wallet addresses supposed to be "your" wallet?
[3:06:29] ipiv: u can hack into wifi
[3:06:30] w0blz: wait lol
[3:06:31] powerferno1: when you route with mac address, you forward to the router mac
[3:06:31] ipiv: big deal
[3:06:33] ipiv: ?????
[3:06:34] hyperpopdaiIy: receiver address is the same for all transactions, multiple accounts sending to one master account, mac address is showing different pcs with vpns.
[3:06:37] oaksfr: @smg_marty
[3:06:38] luckerooni: @chakaw667, 5Head
[3:06:38] Hevs: MAC address is not changeable with a vpn. its specifically tied to each system
[3:06:44] ipiv: so, all u get is internet access
[3:06:45] entergaymode: mhm perfect

[3:07:04] exoqqen: i am literally not following at all, bruteforce ip how
[3:07:06] powerferno1: yeah vpn doesn't change mac address, mac address is your local lan subnet address provided.
[3:07:08] dshogun91: Dentge
[3:07:14] Aetholite: @Hevs Its not modelled like IRL, the mac changes every time you hack a different IP and MAC
[3:07:15] SmellyGoatZ: forsenThink

[3:26:14] Racko5: i dont get how you can connect to the same wifi in different houses, its just weird
[3:26:16] yazakeli: Maybe it's something that didn't come out yet
[3:26:17] xoyorkofdork: omg lol
[3:26:19] Wrigage: He was busy earlier, he might answer your call now
[3:26:20] Aetholite: @Aetholite Receive just shows your wallet address, and I think that address stays the same no matter what

[3:27:04] no_name_jinkel: maybe wifi with mac address?
[3:27:05] ipiv: he did
[3:27:06] KC_Curlz: Each Tsunami you need a new wifi so one PC can register multiple mac adresses for multiple transfers
[3:27:08] blazedatlas: the hard drive being swapped to different pcs?
[3:27:09] dkakr: well yea someone transferred everything in one wallet
[3:27:12] onix146: ome5 the cold war butcoin version
[3:27:13] Aetholite: @omie No, its probably the same Device sending to the same other PC with a different wifi (after tsunami)
[3:27:17] kalemeadows: pcs were gaining butcoin without wifi so how could you hack them through wifi to steal it?
[3:27:20] Albion1999: But if thats the case, how would u even protect it lol
[3:27:22] silentdojo: Not trying to backseat but Doesn't Binance say Public transactions....
[3:27:23] brikbeans: you have to connect to that mother ship thing as a pc that already is a sender/ receiver on that account
[3:27:24] luckerooni: i think it is a system you can beat but i think you need to get the macguffin to complete the hack and that's one of those ??? items
[3:27:28] ipiv: im not gonna meta
[3:27:29] exoqqen: are you sure though? ive never seen a RP wallet that hasnt been local to its PC

[3:51:25] luvvkoa: or there is hidden shit
[3:51:36] HandOfTheDivine: You just have to find out how to get peoples user name and crypto address somehow so you can yoink the wallet
[3:51:44] Sidhuu: Mac address changes every so often

[3:51:47] Jefsama: the devs dont know how teworking and crypto work
[3:51:48] blazedatlas: mhm
[3:51:50] Szakul: Maybe its NPC thing and you hack to the NPC wallets
[3:51:52] 잔존자: Yeah so mac and IP everyone can connect to but the suer names and addresses are different so you literally cant hack anyone (yet)
[3:51:55] Double_AA_21: Jackass glizzyL
[3:51:55] TenActy_Jesse: u think people just transfer once between 2 pcs then they re did smoke crack for some reason and sent again i think your looking into it too much
[3:51:56] brikbeans: @expressve and so far we can match 1 of 3 the mac address
[3:51:57] slimelicks: i h8 that the wallet app don't so a balance
[3:52:06] majin29: maybe its user based
[3:52:11] Aetholite: Its the same PC on different WIFI not different PCs
[3:52:11] luvvkoa: whats the point of a vpn if people can track ur addresses
[3:52:12] blazedatlas: same harddrive connecting to a different mac?
[3:52:14] RedaB96: i dont think there is multiple pc with same crypto adress
[3:52:24] Stepanov370: Waiting

[3:52:35] bahhval: what if they just swapped the vpn?
[3:52:36] windbeast00: @omie maybe its registered to the house?
[3:52:44] j07777770: or someone has a bunch of PCs

[3:53:00] luvvkoa: hide*
[3:53:01] RedaB96: that i dont know
[3:53:03] bahhval: masking each transactions with a new VPN because theyre dumb?
[3:53:03] EmryG: @windbeast00 surely its this right? because x need a key to access your computers @omie
[3:53:04] blazedatlas: i cannot confirm nor deny
[3:53:11] wally___rn: this some mr robot shit
[3:53:12] SykoOGs: or sending to the same IP from different PCs
[3:53:15] dank_mick3y: when you collect the butcoin you get the notif Stashed successfuly what if when you get on someones network you can only take the crypto on the miner app?
[3:53:20] JustTomMeh: we know the butcoin is on the hdd, are the addresses tied to the VPN or?

[3:53:37] luvvkoa: vpn?
[3:53:39] brikbeans: what if they are leaving a trail and doing something cool pogu
[3:53:39] 잔존자: Because 1 person can have multiple PC's set up
[3:53:39] Danintheira: @omie wifi gets taken out at tsunami, so they scan for more wifi, creating new mac addresses

[3:54:06] 5Jonny: spaghetti code
[3:54:06] luvvkoa: Clueless

[3:54:10] Envictos: wrong
[3:54:13] SLK66666: what if its just bugged?
[3:54:13] common_idiot: maybe they have like 7 computers at the same physical location so the Username is tied to the isp and not the hardware
[3:54:13] brikbeans: What if they are changing it on purpose because they figured something out.
[3:54:15] Laeret: If VPN doesnt change anything whats the purpose?
[3:54:16] inyankrak: Mac changes if connects to a different wifi
[3:54:16] hackwin: they took screen show so they have multiple wifis mac and ips
[3:54:18] Shinobi_0906: maybe someone is just really paranoid
[3:54:19] slurpy824: maybe the other parties are stupid lmao
[3:54:19] w0blz: so mac isnt local. mac is what you are connected to
[3:54:19] pixelgumerino: anything = wrong
[3:54:21] bubblebummmm: i miss the womp womp shit during the casino heist omE
[3:54:22] hackwin: screenshot*
[3:54:28] Aetholite: You just tested it with JP he got a different MAC or not?
[3:54:32] 잔존자: Yeah but the problem is there's also usernames and addresses which are different for every PC even if on the same mac
[3:54:34] brikbeans: yeh jean paul said he knew his by heart so
[3:54:37] TenActy_Jesse: someone is just stupid thats the anwser they wasted a but coin
[3:54:41] RedaB96: oh so you got the scan only once and never scanned again ?
[3:54:41] Sidhuu: Mac depends on the network your connected to
[3:54:43] NewbornMink: Are different users sending to the same MAC address?
[3:54:45] inyankrak: its the router mac address you are connected to
[3:54:46] xSpaceChase: mac address is connected to each player, wont change
[3:54:48] kaivaIya: the space reptiles manipulate the microwave uv rays in order to hypnotize los santos residents into changing their ip
[3:54:52] UglyLoserIdiot: what if an app on the computer is spoofing fake things and so some transactions aren’t real
[3:54:55] Konkwistador_1002: is mac determined by the wifi you connect to?
[3:54:56] EmryG: @omie why do you think x required a key to access your computers earlier?
[3:54:56] slurpy824: some moron is just wasting 1 btc whenever they wanna login

[3:55:22] w0blz: exactly it seems very weird. why are they switching network
[3:55:22] simon_lob: idk im dumb
[3:55:25] Aetholite: Wait, can you reuse the old mac address from before tsunami?
[3:55:25] common_idiot: or maybe the wallet is tied to the person and you have one person using multiple computers
[3:55:26] veqzei: why do u think theres multiple pcs on the same wallet?
[3:55:26] Sidhuu: Wallet is tied to the physical player
[3:55:30] brizulyxd: hello omie
[3:55:39] muricapewpew: is the wallet tied to the hard drive?
[3:55:40] bahhval: can you swap parts into a new pc and get the same wallet?
[3:55:42] pokerspace: Hard drive mac address?
[3:55:43] eliteviewer77: I can't speak because I know meta so I can't speak on theory
[3:55:44] brikbeans: can you move the coins from within the same wallet to different harddrives
[3:55:44] bahhval: like if you swapped HDD to another PC
[3:55:44] Stepanov370: @cachovski LieMeter EEEHHH
[3:55:48] RedaB96: wallet is tied to either player or hdd
[3:55:53] slurpy824: wyat?
[3:55:54] 5Jonny: i was thinking that also
[3:55:56] jubes___: Wha
[3:55:58] 5Jonny: person?
[3:56:04] common_idiot: is your username the same on every computer?
[3:56:06] Danintheira: @omie what if larry keeps using the same mac and ip address in smokecrack, and not scanning
[3:56:06] veqzei: user name should just be the person using the pc
[3:56:07] sykikLive: what
[3:56:10] Enitd: that sucks if true
[3:56:12] Sidhuu: Yes what i said
[3:56:12] exoqqen: what
[3:56:13] brikbeans: tied to thumb print... no shot
[3:56:15] Kingofswags2003: No way it's player based
[3:56:15] RAAZR: agree, makes sense
[3:56:37] 잔존자: The username and address changes based on different macs you connect to no?
[3:56:41] Aetholite: Can you reuse IP and MAC address from salty scan after a tsunami?
[3:56:43] xSpaceChase: different people using same pc gives different address
[3:56:43] deusregia: if you broke into someone’s home you could transfer bitcoin to yourself no?  be sure to save yours somewhere in case
[3:56:52] 5Jonny: yup
[3:56:59] ItsDoozerrr: mhm
[3:57:00] luckerooni: same
[3:57:00] Sidhuu: That's what i said
[3:57:02] muricapewpew: maybe try taking out your hard drive and putting it in Yuno’s pc and see if the bitcoin and Mac transfer?
[3:57:07] brikbeans: can you move the coins from within the same wallet to different physical hard-drives
[3:57:09] BoywithVIP: pickle
[3:57:21] Shone52: any clues on actual desktops? i see lifeinvader and some code
[3:57:21] txch321: y
[3:57:23] SykoOGs: yea
[3:57:25] veqzei: the user name is attached to player but adress is hardware, no?
[3:57:26] Bruno530: omeh whack
[3:57:30] common_idiot: not surprised, it's the most trivial solution
[3:57:30] luckerooni: its like signing your signature onto the hard drive when you install a miner and no one else can replace it
[3:57:32] Geack_: So the hdd gets connected to your dna? lol \
[3:57:34] rsalexander12: you can't hack if so?
[3:57:36] Jefsama: Shit coding
[3:57:39] 잔존자: Yeah but what if you changed out HDD and transferred crypto to it, doesnt it mean it's not linked?
[3:57:39] jubes___: How to test or prove
[3:57:50] brikbeans: cant two different people see same amount on same computer?

[3:58:18] BoywithVIP: does that mean the cops would know its yours
[3:58:20] pixelgumerino: Clueless
[3:58:21] 잔존자: I legit think you cant hack crypto out of other people, only steal the HDD atm
[3:58:23] txch321: So once it leaks it's over?
[3:58:25] jubes___: hmm
[3:58:27] blazedatlas: Well, yuno did say he was doing it with Mr K and others. What if they were taking their HD around to different computers at dif houses to combine so would have different mac address?
[3:58:28] Stepanov370: Concerned surely it's not that
[3:58:28] common_idiot: I mean, if you assume someone uses the same login on every computer they use. not that unreasonable but kinda dumb
[3:58:30] NewbornMink: Does that mean you can't have multiple wallets then?
[3:58:38] ohhotto: can you set up a new wallet?
[3:58:39] brikbeans: gotta suck some dna off these dudes to hack?
[3:58:40] 1cegem: May aswell get the wizard on this shi
[3:58:42] Laeret: @잔존자 what would stealing HDD out of PC do if you cant get butcoin from that
[3:58:50] luvvkoa: @brikbeans huh
[3:58:53] Messagge: maybe the sniffa app changer all that
[3:58:59] hhc9623: Kinda has to, how could the hacker rep work without the person connected to the hdd?
[3:58:59] Messagge: changes
[3:59:05] brikbeans: @luvvkoa like some hair
[3:59:10] 잔존자: @잔존자 The coins are linked to it though, they stay on the hdd
[3:59:11] samlecs: maybe focus on utility first
[3:59:12] Danintheira: @omie is larry using the same mac and ip in smokecrack, and not scanning for wifi?
[3:59:12] muricapewpew: so if you rob someone’s house and take their hdd out of their computer then you get their coin?
[3:59:16] luvvkoa: @luvvkoa SUSSY
[3:59:26] Sidhuu: @messagge sniffer != spoofer
[3:59:37] Chroni9: What if its just the sniffing app or that you can intercept peoples transaction with the same mac
[3:59:43] Maza_Manny: SNIFFA
[4:00:02] daglins: SNIFFA im gonna sniff your mom not spoof her
[4:00:02] iamSokka: theres gotta be more in the other apps. keep it farmin
[4:00:02] Stepanov370: SNIFFA ≠ ppPoof
[4:00:07] veqzei: SNIFFA
[4:00:07] 1cegem: Cant wait for the new big app top just be a rick roll or sum
[4:00:08] Messagge: sniffer will be locating where they are at so you can steal there hdd that will be the only way to steal crypto???
[4:00:09] luckerooni: if anything the spoof would be noid because it'd... remove your id
[4:00:12] Messagge: thats lame
[4:00:12] Dark_Rendy: s ppPoof
[4:00:12] 잔존자: I really doubt they'd make it this easy to steal coins with just connecting to someone elses mac/ip
[4:00:22] Aetholite: @omie Can you reuse old salty results from an earlier tsunami?
[4:00:27] Kingofswags2003: Wouldn't sniff be just monitoring traffic on your network?
[4:00:27] hackwin: or for ip
[4:00:32] bahhval: sniff is usually like scanning networks
[4:00:37] brikbeans: i think there are two more methods to match up the account and crypto, once you have all three you're in 5head.
[4:00:40] SykoOGs: maybe the noid is the app for hacking stuff
[4:00:40] Sidhuu: Yeah since there aren't packets being sent in the game
[4:00:47] CunningChaos: Now imagine you could get keyloggers on here LUL
[4:00:52] dank_mick3y: pickle
[4:00:53] flohwbye: but he didnt really know what to look for
[4:00:54] common_idiot: so does this basically mean you can't hack into somebody's wallet?
[4:00:56] donazeri: i wonder what towerdefense gonna be
[4:01:04] UniiqueHD: poorly implemented game mechanics
[4:01:09] MrTobbla: you think yuno Will buy you a miner rack if you send crypto? so you dont have to buy app
[4:01:12] w0blz: what is the + in the app? can more login
[4:01:15] blazedatlas: Yeah you guys were on same network from different HDDs which would explain the different crypto address
[4:01:22] w0blz: at the top left
[4:01:26] warrantyvoidifremoved: are the wallet addresses and usernames different on all your computers or are they just tied to your player?
[4:01:26] brikbeans: tru opposed from another state id type beat
[4:01:26] grimreaper_108: maybe you cannot hack "into" the blockchain ..
[4:01:27] luckerooni: i think they did that to make people's names more anonymous when it shows up on binance
[4:01:29] EmryG: wouldnt look as hacker-y tho
[4:01:29] common_idiot: would be cool if you had to create your own registration and could have more than one registered account
[4:01:29] grimreaper_108: weaknesses outside of the blockchain that create opportunities for thieves
[4:01:30] Stepanov370: oscuh buh sta

[4:02:23] brikbeans: wait wtf
[4:02:25] Stepanov370: forsenCD
[4:02:27] common_idiot: would've also been cool if they made it so everything was command line and you had to learn the code via user guides
[4:02:46] sh4gun: hackerman
