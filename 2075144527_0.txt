[2:20:45] eXceLenT_: we, as chat, have collectively agreed you are to blame Kappa
[2:20:46] Sax850: What she did was very out of turn for her own person (not OOC) - so I understand why the other side is pushing charges against Ruth, especially the whole "it was a joke angle" is a weak one. But I highly doubt that Ruth will actually get charged by anythin in the end,
[2:20:47] Lupusdeus: i DO think Snow probably has a case to answer tbh...
[2:20:52] Chrissy1337: and you already know Snow would never do it lol

[2:23:02] sauslol: Tell them Ruth what you did with Cornwood
[2:23:04] Chrissy1337: i think they all suck at their job, cool characters but we are 3 months in and there is less cops than they started with it feels like

[2:23:28] TheShaunBro: What if Jackie was always a Gnome?
[2:23:29] kiolkjm: the wording  " What if we vote to overthrow the counsil of 8 " that implies her bringing the other captains into the treasonous act

[2:24:47] CorysAlternative: yea that will happen surely
[2:24:48] OdilonRedonn: In Crane we trust, they are reading the legislation wrong
[2:24:48] serendipity3456: Hi to the person who timed me out, what did I do wrong? I’ve just joined, it would have been polite to warn me not to not repeat whatever I did wrong instead of muting me. I am highly confused.
[2:24:53] sendu6666: what you mean "turned on PD"? as if lawyers are supposed to be on PD's side or something?
[2:25:00] Athasin: @Neiara__ Valid point
[2:25:01] phinn01: The amount of conflicting and differing opinions has been SO entertaining peepoPopcorn
[2:25:01] sshineysean: breaking news: random officer assumes he better understands legislation co-written (and he’s voted) by the Chief Justice Crane LUL
[2:25:14] gumby_did_it2: clienteDance nakkiSteer kebunSass kebunEZ saabDap2
[2:25:16] Johnny_fn_mo: ARREST RUTH FOR TREASON!
[2:25:29] smd_junior: This RP is so cool, so reflective of usual work politics, all positioning, stories and influencing. Sneaky and underhand! Love it uhsLove
[2:25:29] sokjuice: but chief justice isn't literally the law tbh
[2:25:32] BluGiant: @Johnny_fn_mo  sniffthenewchatter
[2:25:34] StarWhistle517: uhsBongo uhsBongo uhsBongo
[2:25:35] AnalgesicPM: Sedition would be closer...but it ain't that either lol
[2:25:37] BluGiant: LUL
[2:25:44] Miterex: wait but chief justice is also a moron for passing this? Im confused
[2:25:47] sendu6666: so she can "joke" about it and not even getting a dap ?
[2:25:52] Kyle_txt: Ruth also is completely wrong about how this law wworks
[2:25:54] comrade_rabbitt: Oliver got disqualified from CW case, & the lawyer slacks went to went to the mayor
[2:25:57] sokjuice: not really, it depends on all testimonial
[2:26:00] Prollos: covers her from double jeopardy too, cant be hit with it again in a tantrum
[2:26:00] HallJams: and an appeal would guarantee it as the result
[2:26:06] Kermamakkara: Crane was absolutely trying to de-escalate instead of anything else
[2:26:12] CorysAlternative: yes
[2:26:13] WaxPert: he was trying to keep the peace, it wasn’t that it’s not treasonous
[2:26:17] Sax850: That's not what this is about @sendu6666 Being charged with Treason/Sedition vs getting DAPs are very different
[2:26:27] Nobbleberry: nodd
[2:26:27] StephyFace: 100%
[2:26:28] Neiara__: I guess it depends if they find more evidence via phone etc
[2:26:29] phinn01: nodd
[2:26:33] biboirl: yeah but not when the mayor can be corrupt
[2:26:34] KappaManJason: what do you think of cornwood thing
[2:26:35] KeiKeiNi: @sendu6666 it wasn't a joke, it was a reduction to absurdity
[2:26:35] khaled_5655: ALBERT KINGGGG swizzmBINO
[2:26:36] BfAleTitan: right, Max himself said it may go away after this term
[2:26:40] sokjuice: to determine guilty or not guilty can't be done from just listening to a heated conversation. Crane should know that well enough
[2:26:47] Dee__1__: 60 days left
[2:26:49] jaaashkay: @uhSnow that's also with the assumption that the judge had all the facts at the time.  an investigation might turn up private conversations that indeed make the charge applicable.  I think there is enough PC/RS for an investigation/subpoenas
[2:26:52] kaei22: so who is going to face the consequences if this screws pd Even more?
[2:26:53] Muempire0: everything the council passes can be repealed
[2:26:54] EllFrancos: the thing none of them mention though that the mayor does have oversight in the form of the council being able to impeach him
[2:26:56] sshineysean: completing the chain of command so the caltains can delegate properly is also MUcH needed… I’m sure Saab will appreciate that (if not slacks)
[2:26:59] phinn01: oop

[2:27:08] ens0mniac: Ruth spreading misinformation about this law to stir shit amongst the PD in order to gain support for her bid to get him impeached is gonna backfire for her so bad lol
[2:27:09] Hillbilly_Hxck: Gigachad Beric
[2:27:10] CeruleanBandit: Spiccyyyyyyyyyy

[2:27:41] KooterNoodle: until the court case is over
[2:27:42] StephyFace: @KooterNoodle she's already suspended, she suspended herself
[2:27:42] DanLGG: I like this. It’s been great so far. Rather than having ppl refer to the senate and OOC conversations they can reach out to the council. I like it.
[2:27:44] KappaManJason: they had people who never interact with cornwood in panel so
[2:27:44] Neiara__: Maybe was removed I remember during Beric earlier his name was on full blast lol
[2:27:45] Whitey22: Beric is really cool
[2:27:52] ergofoe: Beric has some steel balls, love it

[2:28:28] Sax850: Ok, now that is misinformation. Max fired the former Chief of Staff because she couldnt work indepeently at all (to chat, not to snow)
[2:28:34] TenseTokki: I mean what cop would say no to a chance at getting commissioner berics just playing smart
[2:28:35] Lupusdeus: Cornwood as sheriff bringing in jackie would be the best tbh
[2:28:36] WaxPert: god she can’t twist this so much…
[2:28:37] Witzz_: doesnt it say in the legislation that the commissioner when in office doesnt report to anyone but the state?
[2:28:40] Dark_wdman: this story  is getting spicy , seeing this from all side is soo good. i hope everyone enjoying it widepeepoHappy

[2:32:16] Kinamazing: @dark_wdman ty!!
[2:32:18] Sax850: I think the biggest issue that originally made Moon/Max want to do this law/legislation is because he was annoyed that the PD is their own "judge, jury and executioner" and the captains are all 3. But its escalated beyond that now so its hard to say exactly where this will lead @uhsnow @chat

[2:33:03] sshineysean: not that anybody has proof… but Ruth, while leaving that first heated meeting, outright said to slacks and Turner that she wouldn’t acknowledge this legislation if passed… if that was on paper, they’d actually have a strong case for treason. they still might 🤷🏻‍♂️

[2:51:03] hpc_young: because people are stupid
[2:51:04] ExoticMeats: Last hold out for when the mayor comes for PD
[2:51:06] dommeka: there were like 100k viewers watching that scene.
[2:51:13] KeiKeiNi: Because integrity
[2:51:13] kiolkjm: ya 6 more ppl were there that were just already there k ramee bobby carmine most of the rest were cornwoods legal team
[2:51:19] zap_rowsdower_42: cornwood was screaming at one point
[2:51:21] CuBanMumzy: saab weakness, wanting RP
[2:51:34] st3adyguy: They were actually talking about different things at first until that happened.
[2:51:37] sonadapop: for sure, i kinda meant that in a rhetorical way as in "give the viewers what they want". my b
[2:51:41] K00PAD00P: slacks kinda seems weak though
[2:51:44] Lupusdeus: I think it's the way that Slacks would handle it tho based on his character
[2:51:45] sokjuice: literally all the biggest streamers online at that time were there OMEGALAUGHING
[2:51:47] schmidtystorm: do we think maybe a sense of guilt is overcoming slacks?
[2:51:48] Theburkeinator: getting fired for killing a 1 life character is weak af tho
[2:51:51] awaknsleep: it was mostly timing that it happened at all
[2:51:54] Xen_Crypt: he did eventually move inside
[2:51:55] ExoticMeats: True
[2:51:57] sokjuice: even fucking NMP was offline and turned up i think
[2:51:58] karaskyee: a lot of pressure and low morale
[2:51:59] proplayerbmb11: the crazy part is Oliver hall is what set off cornwood last night
[2:52:02] dommeka: great RP.
[2:52:03] FilzG: Ruth just got suspended @uhSnow ?
[2:52:03] Neverywhere: @K00PAD00P naive and idealistic, sure, but not weak imo
[2:52:04] TenseTokki: The clips make it so much more apparent why beric thought he had to step up if he heard about that
[2:52:05] KeiKeiNi: Slacks is young and inexperienced
[2:52:11] Dee__1__: LUL
[2:52:12] ArenaKrusher: I hope ssaab brings "hard" Slacks, like he did with Bass back in the day Pog
[2:52:14] comrade_rabbitt: he fell on his sword for the other Cpts
[2:52:14] chambo2007: saaab was loving the RP too

[2:52:26] powerpuncher24: SeemsGood

[2:52:30] NGVtv: brilliant idea
[2:52:30] K00PAD00P: @Neverywhere I mean supporting treason kinda seems weak but sure
[2:52:32] FilzG: Did Ruth go offline?
[2:52:35] evil_bullett: @Theburkeinator being a 1 lifer does not mean anything
[2:52:36] ashie02: way better to rp for yourself  and the way you want to tbh, numbers dont matterr
[2:52:37] NGVtv: it can be like streamer battle royale
[2:52:46] infectious37: floating blue checkmarks?
[2:52:46] KooterNoodle: things should be getting better in the PD now that Ruth is suspended
[2:52:47] awaknsleep: actually a lot of smaller steamers are getting attention due to all this it’s cool
[2:52:48] LuckyPaddy: Didn't NEW WORLD try that?
[2:52:51] Lupusdeus: @ashie02 And i think that's what slacks was doing
[2:52:59] Vaigo1: slacks attempted to move the conversation inside a couple of times, but cornwood had good reason not to follow
[2:53:06] Neverywhere: @K00PAD00P hehe I think his naivete allowed him to see the best in Ruth. "It must've been a joke, heh heh"
[2:53:09] buuutty: I dont get why the captains arent releasing all the info on cornwoods case to the pd so there isnt so much misinformation going around
[2:53:10] Istaf_SC: People need to realize Esfand is  kind of over the PD atm and is moving Cornwood into other areas such as government.
[2:53:10] nebxhelix: People forget that the commisioner role is still chosen and approved by the state ... not the council
[2:53:12] Kyle_txt: LUL
[2:53:15] k4ncha: KEKW
[2:53:20] phinn01: KEKW

[2:53:24] K00PAD00P: @Neverywhere hmm yeah maybe
[2:53:30] ashie02: @Lupusdeus fairs,,, but if it doesnt suit everyone then they shouldnt join just because pf high view count haha, rp can be fun even without views :' )
[2:53:31] NGVtv: M word monkaW
[2:53:48] phinn01: Blackwell Sadge
[2:53:55] Addietwo: so did Cornwood get fired or still waiting to hear?
[2:53:59] ArenaKrusher: poor Slasher LUL

[2:54:28] Antarxia: @Addietwo he was supposed to get his answer in 24h after his hearing but i think after that whole scene that complicates things
[2:54:28] Istaf_SC: @Addietwo They're going to tell him today at some point but its HIGHLY likely hes fired
[2:54:30] sokjuice: Nekoda pepeLaugh
[2:54:33] KooterNoodle: crazy power move by slacks
[2:54:35] Lupusdeus: @ashie02 i personally didnt feel as though anybody there was playing for views, i felt like they all played their char. Most OOC was Cornwood blowing his top but his char had obvious reason for that
[2:54:37] OdilonRedonn: @Addietwo got reviewed now the verdict is pending because he's getting charged with murder
[2:54:40] nebxhelix: PD has to many Karens ...lol

[3:05:26] StarWhistle517: perfect time for me to check the oil on the generators uhsTea
[3:05:34] salveck: @CuBanMumzy exactly, this is stupid, they should adjust these timings or should've started PD 2-3 months before the city opened KEKW
[3:05:43] lovelee___: @thebirminghambaron ruth suspended herself
[3:05:48] thebirminghambaron: Nice!
[3:05:49] BfAleTitan: i think the issue is less "full functioning" and more just "functioning"
[3:05:56] Chrissy1337: i mean CuBanMumzy at least some form of strucutre and a decent representation in every shift

[3:11:11] Lucsvm: ppl say fired Ruth, and then what?
[3:11:15] BluGiant: LUL
[3:11:15] Panos_97: @Lucsvm I was obviously joking, but to be fair, replacing her should be a given with the attention she's drawn to PD HC
[3:11:15] comrade_rabbitt: demote the captains
[3:11:19] BluGiant: OOOO
[3:11:21] Aymen_bdj: Snow looks a bit like Moonmoon if u know what I mean Kappa
[3:11:23] 1CaptainRedBeard1: Only reason to fire Ruth is optics.
[3:11:23] NarwhalArgy: @Prollos To be fair if you watched the shit last night you would understand why
[3:11:24] MDM4ever1986HD: Make Cornwood as a captain along with Den Zel and Beric
[3:11:24] combattingjosh: @Lucsvm Promote Turner
[3:11:29] ReeceWithAC: my naughty brain keeps thining DAP stands for something entirely different KEKW
[3:11:37] Kenderssss: i just got here what happen with lovesick
[3:11:38] Idejder: @senselessrage_ but to what end? What would new leadership do different? I think the bigger solution is empowering officers to be more aggressive or act more independently without fear of DAP over everything. Right now everyone is looking over their shoulder and its stressful
[3:11:39] pearjuice: @Prollos yeah surely leadership has nothing to do with all the problems, surely
[3:11:41] smd_junior: Sack king, he is the secret overlord of all the issues uhsSpin
[3:11:43] jay_jaymann: positive attitudes while the PD goes through the expected growing pains.
[3:11:48] perox89: just needs time, and maybe the mayor keeping his nose out

[3:11:59] KingKova: Hey this Marc Rebillet. Dud'e legit
[3:12:06] clowniusthe1st: Jammer
[3:12:06] LadyLynxx: @kenderssss he is on the edge of leaving pd
[3:12:15] BluGiant: @ReeceWithAC Does sound like a p***hub category LUL
[3:12:15] UrNotReza: the leaders in the PD need to support their officers, praise them more often then degrading them. focus more on policing the city rather than each other. this is the only answer.
[3:12:16] Kenderssss: @LadyLynxx ty an ooof
[3:12:17] philydreams: @Lucsvm she commited treason
[3:12:18] MDM4ever1986HD: @Lucsvm evidence tampering and such
[3:12:22] BluGiant: OOOO
[3:12:24] Zyphamon: @Lucsvm because she's a scapegoat. that's basically the only reason
[3:12:25] LadyLynxx: Big oof
[3:12:26] condor2104: I think make Ruth a regular cop, no need to fire her
[3:12:31] hpc_young: King is the jar jar of pd. its his fault for all the evil lol
[3:12:32] MDM4ever1986HD: treason is another one
[3:12:32] JediJacob_: in my many years of watching no pixel i have seen every iteration of pd. To fix this one they need to have officers who are willing to hold officers accountable. I partially agree there needs to be a command structure but the server/pd is only 2 months old. With time CoC can be established but as far as the rp goes they're still trying to build off a failed pd
[3:12:33] tangobish: ruth is like the best rp in the pd right now, its all ppl talk about it
[3:12:33] BluGiant: HUH
[3:12:36] BluGiant: LUL
[3:12:38] Sahil6255: whats lovesick twitch chat ??
[3:12:41] Rambler: HUH
[3:12:41] Lucsvm: @Zyphamon 100% agree
[3:12:50] OdilonRedonn: @UrNotReza hit the nail on the head
[3:12:52] comrade_rabbitt: Ruth needs to be demoted, her PD RP has made things interesting
[3:12:54] ashie02: what did ruth do for all this to happen?
[3:12:55] Lucsvm: if Ruth got fired the content in the PD is over
[3:12:57] JamieGhomie: @perox89 Mayor stepping in has created great RP for so many people. And may light a fire under the PD.
[3:13:03] Nobbleberry: @Sahil6255 belowthewaves
[3:13:08] ergofoe: Ruth needs to be a high command officer for sure, but not a captain.
[3:13:12] MDM4ever1986HD: @tangobish she's the best villian she's all the chatters talk about
[3:13:15] condor2104: yeah its been great RP, just hope it lasts
[3:13:21] CeruleanBandit: might get easier after they hire more people
[3:13:23] Galileothe1: more command members around for each shift, more old gaurd ftos who retire after a bit maybe, more money for the pd for cars and events, and someone needs to find some morale classic
[3:13:27] Conroar4: creed, Pog
[3:13:29] tangobish: @MDM4ever1986HD exactly, without her it'd be really boring rn lol
[3:13:30] uselesscanteen: the problem is everything around punishment is only suspension and firing - try other corrective actions that arent are serious like desk duty
[3:13:31] 0neM0nthResub: can you take me higher?
[3:13:38] combattingjosh: @Lucsvm That content is already coming to an end. New content would be when/IF Max allows the Sheriff office
[3:13:42] Lil_Miss1: Get rid of slacks, stop the constant command meetings and care more about the officers ie promoting the capable ppos to full officers asap
[3:13:42] proplayerbmb11: as much as i love SAAB he needs to stay a captain or go back to senior.. i feel like he has no backbone when it comes to the other captains and just falls in line
[3:13:47] condor2104: True, yo need an antagonist
[3:13:52] philydreams: Ruth needs to pay for her treasonous acts of infidelity
[3:14:03] MDM4ever1986HD: Ruth should never touch captain again I feel for Slacks and Turners as she's got Slacks wrapped around her little finger
[3:14:04] combattingjosh: Also, stop cop stacking in MRPD NODDERS
[3:14:18] Lucsvm: @combattingjosh imo this Max thing is not gonna last man, unless he have devs back him up
[3:14:18] MDM4ever1986HD: It's not Slacks it's Ruth
[3:14:21] vthockey1973: Snu vs Ruth Showdown

[3:14:29] tangobish: @combattingjosh but thats the best rp
[3:14:33] BfAleTitan: why does the Antagonist need to be a PD captain, there are plenty of criminals for that

[3:14:51] 1CaptainRedBeard1: @proplayerbmb11 I'm thinking this might be something that develops at this point. I have this feeling Slack's will realize he can't always fall in line.
[3:14:53] StarWhistle517: uhsVibe uhsVibe uhsVibe uhsVibe uhsVibe

[3:14:59] MDM4ever1986HD: @BfAleTitan yeah we've got MR K for that
[3:15:03] combattingjosh: @Lucsvm He has 2 years. Imo I think "his wife" will be the next mayor.
[3:15:10] CeruleanBandit: malton was the true shadow puppeteer
[3:15:12] condor2104: great song
[3:15:20] uhSnow: sec dudes
[3:15:26] MDM4ever1986HD: Malton is the true fence sitter
[3:15:27] KingKova: I think bringing the natural corruption into GTA, the mayor should be able to pardon once every so often, then the Mayor should elect Cornwood to a cabinet position who overseas PD, then they have to deal with Cornwood's Reno911 attitude.....would be gold content

[3:16:06] condor2104: malton is not a Ruth fan, he not getting involved
[3:16:09] MDM4ever1986HD: Sadge
[3:16:15] Lucsvm: @pearjuice Devs back him up in the idea of that type of government, but he can fuck it up fast
[3:16:19] Aymen_bdj: It'd Carey that Malton in the position that he is in now
[3:16:19] MDM4ever1986HD: @ergofoe I hope you washed your hands
[3:16:24] phinn01: PeepiLove
[3:16:25] ReeceWithAC: Sadge
[3:16:31] TwistedStreams: They need a Commissioner above the Captains who can review the DAPs and make suspension and firing decisions. The Captains cannot both issue DAPs and review them for consequences. Checks and balances are needed. The legislation will help with this.
[3:16:34] SteelMintMedic: I think that the lack of funds really hurt the formative steps of PD months ago and this is the lasting effect from that. A 'public servant' should not have to pay to keep the department running.
[3:16:34] Istaf_SC: The reason the PD is so fucked is because of THE WAY daps are handed out. They're kind of subjective and its really easy for ANY officer to get a dap and fired. So when people see the way they're handed out it seems gatekeepy and it causes issues. Also they keep saying "follow the CoC" but basically everything is ignored. It took them 3 months to make changes to the dap system. Daps themselves are fine, but they need to be taken more seriously by the cpts when they hand one out.
[3:16:34] Danifinch: @uhSnow ... Sorry My Dog Ate My Homework.
[3:16:35] Istaf_SC: Like running in the halls = dap is stupid. Or any of these other small things people get daps for. And whats even dumber is the last dap Dean got. He pitted a car in SOP conditions with pomission and someone just HAPPEN to be there.
[3:16:37] jay2seam: Shift captains' focus from punishing their own to punishing criminals. Policing is being done own selves.
[3:16:38] CeruleanBandit: <3
[3:16:40] KeiKeiNi: It's a hard question, tbh I don't see a good solution, for sure there needs to be a little quicker progression from PPO cos there are quite a lot of POOs that are waiting and waiting to be officers. But more than that idk
[3:16:41] EmrysorMerlin: Problem with PD is that it's not been built up its like most building projects lagging behind crime etc gone faster PD not been ahead of curve which it needed to be also cop stacking at MRPD without the numbers to cover
[3:16:42] RealGasoline: I might have to put my opinion in discord, It's a novel @uhSnow oop
[3:16:42] Kasvar: lookUp
[3:16:43] st3adyguy: the DAP system should be improve in a way that would give more leeway for officers to roleplay. There should be a board to review the DAPs that officer received.
[3:16:44] Amandathecookie: no
[3:16:45] CuBanMumzy: people should have patience, PD is only two months old and started with literally nothing. The captains want a CoP and for that CoP to pick their own command structure but i don't think they have  made this vision aware to PD.
[3:16:46] Lil_Miss1: I'm sorry @uhsnow rip to your nana
[3:16:46] MDM4ever1986HD: I hope you washed your hands
[3:16:46] sophiebandito: no dog ate it
[3:16:47] Lucsvm: Chatting
[3:16:47] Amandathecookie: i no like homework
[3:16:48] Nobbleberry: my dog ate mine. sorry
[3:16:50] HaraSea: Long time viewer, first-time chatter! Honestly I think more CoC which is hard with the numbers right now and if the captains were just a teensy bit less harsh. Punishment should be a thing but so should talking with people about an issue first.
[3:16:50] TheDaveCExperience: bring back Stubble and make him commissioner EZ
[3:16:51] StarWhistle517: i forgot my homework
[3:16:51] Tigerfreeze: Chatting nope
[3:16:51] ashie02: i didnt do my homework im sorry i favoured a nap
[3:16:52] Lupusdeus: A million different views as u would expect...
[3:16:52] Kasvar: lookUp so many essays
[3:16:53] Chrissy1337: everybody posting their paragraphs lol
[3:16:53] MexiBrent: Transparency with punishments, the captains don't want to air out other people's dirty laundry but then those people go tell their side and it makes everyone hate the captains. Instead of getting all the info, and they think it's just the captains being too harsh. Playing telephone and gossipers is what  is killing the PD. Also the people that are complaining about numbers don't help. Aziz, Cornwood, and Blackwell are FTOs but Aziz and Cornwood havent real FTOed at all.
[3:16:54] Laura_fei: no i was on tiktok
[3:16:56] kreljos: yeah I decided I'm a viewer and am here to watch and not pretend I could fix anything
[3:16:58] Drexb: The issue of perceived corruption comes from the captains both issuing the daps, and then reviewing the firings, it should be a third party for check and balance.
[3:16:58] hpc_young: I have the real answer
[3:16:59] Istaf_SC: I can do more if you want @uhSnow
[3:17:03] Tigerfreeze: sureHEY Amanda sureHUG moon2CUTE
[3:17:05] Owlmoon: I just got here DinoDance
[3:17:05] Idejder: Hey Snow, do you feel as an office on duty you are limited or feel like you are looking over your shoulder and being afraid of getting DAPs? So you cant act how you want to?
[3:17:07] Muempire0: i believe homework is treason
[3:17:08] StarWhistle517: i had chatgpt do it
[3:17:09] kire_writes_things: lookUp this is way different than Kina's chat
[3:17:09] Amandathecookie: @Tigerfreeze hi cutie
[3:17:12] NupeKeem: This is a nice car.
[3:17:18] Strongdad: 3.0 was a race to see who could collect the most Strikes and go overboard. 4.0 is the exact opposite of the spectrum where every action is held under a DAP microscope with no fun allowed... There needs to be a happy medium where PD can be excited to come to work
[3:17:23] tangobish: @TheDaveCExperience he got told no to stubble
[3:17:23] Solidknight2112: uhsNope
[3:17:24] Calibraso: i didnt atudy pepeMeltdown
[3:17:25] Galileothe1: more command members around for each shift, more old gaurd ftos who retire after a bit maybe, more money for the pd for cars and events, and someone needs to find some morale classic  󠀀
[3:17:30] Lucsvm: pepeW DAPS
[3:17:38] st3adyguy: also DAPs are very damaging that its longer than the statute of limitations
[3:17:38] AntiTarheel: i think a PD union representative would be better RP  than commisioners
[3:17:40] eqnjn: There is no positive reinforcement
[3:17:42] ShhLackEe: Cornwood for commish
[3:17:50] proplayerbmb11: Also there needs to be other people who do the reviews. Not the people who issue the DAPS
[3:17:51] MDM4ever1986HD: The captains need to have more common sense like Turner is doing
[3:17:51] daLight: Good morning snu kinamaWave
[3:17:52] Lil_Miss1: I feel like hiring more older cops could be a good idea
[3:17:56] uselesscanteen: The officers need a union rep to attend the discipline hearings in the stairwell with them
[3:17:58] StreamElements: Yo!  Don't like ads?  Don't feel like being a gigachad and subbing? Twitch Turbo is for you!  https://www.twitch.tv/turbo
[3:18:02] ShhLackEe: bring back ziggy
[3:18:03] CeruleanBandit: its a difficult problem. trying to be fair and harsh w punishments but struggling w numbers and morale
[3:18:03] CaptainFlapjack80: The cops are tougher on other cops than the crims it seems
[3:18:04] ArenaKrusher: need more FTO`s, atleast doubled, fast track old cops and PPO`s
[3:18:11] eri_frost: hire more older cops to help with hiring and filling out coc
[3:18:12] Conroar4: more brian knight and likeminded cops who are long term focused( investigations )
[3:18:19] Lupusdeus: I think there's a fear in PD, discipline before praise, slow promotion, no funds, captains spiralling into a place where they didn't feel a need to have a higher up (they have since said they DO want that now, post mayor interaction)
[3:18:22] condor2104: Cops need better training with legislation, charges etc...
[3:18:24] Picklz: More things need to be off the captians shoulders they try to take on too much of the load
[3:18:30] TwistedStreams: Siobhan wants to create a 2 hour legal course for PD so they know what to do in the cells better.
[3:18:35] Daywalkerblade: just need more ranks in the PD promote people make them feel accomplished and someone above the captains
[3:18:44] NOCTU4: frame it all on brian knight
[3:18:48] RealGasoline: IMO at the moment the chain of command is fine, However the action in the pd is so insanely slow. We all know since the beginning, When Moral is low = Less people on cop then = More hiring then again ends up at "Too many Cops'.
[3:18:54] Idejder: Do you think the success of failure rate of catching criminals, especially with big chances, gun shootings, and robberies, impacts morale?
[3:19:00] Oh_Cai: there no trust or respect in the force
[3:19:01] mizkifsrecedinghairline: <𝘮𝘦𝘴𝘴𝘢𝘨𝘦 𝘥𝘦𝘭𝘦𝘵𝘦𝘥 𝘣𝘺 c𝘢𝘱𝘵𝘢𝘪𝘯 𝘳𝘶𝘵𝘩>

[3:19:03] clowniusthe1st: they specifically didnt want pd 3.0, but theyve gotta get some
[3:19:03] robertsmithjr: i know my opinion is an unpopular one but people wanted consequences to their actions, but now that there are consequences their upset, is it a perfect system no, but it takes time to work through what
[3:19:04] phinn01: more experienced cops nodd
[3:19:05] condor2104: Make Cops Great Again
[3:19:10] AnalgesicPM: how could Brian Knight do this
[3:19:15] KeiKeiNi: Hiring old cops that liked FToing would make sense
[3:19:15] robertsmithjr: whats going to work
[3:19:16] tangobish: @condor2104 whos going to do it?
[3:19:19] Lucsvm: GIGACHAD

[3:19:27] proplayerbmb11: Brian Knight basically started the Sanguine War and got hired back.. How did Jackie not get hired back?
[3:19:27] phinn01: KEKW
[3:19:28] TwistedStreams: If her rent is free why isnt she around more?
[3:19:29] lightwarrior2088: True
[3:19:32] mizkifsrecedinghairline: She's a nice villain though, eh?
[3:19:33] condor2104: @tangobish yeah, thats the issue
[3:19:33] Istaf_SC: Heres something else, and I could be completely wrong. Have the Cpts gone to ANYONE else and ask for suggestions? They're not really listening to people. Listen is key to leadership
[3:19:34] tedium7: Smadge ruth made my coffee cold
[3:19:35] EmrysorMerlin: Too much on individual not the system
[3:19:36] thestolentimes: She is
[3:19:39] condor2104: yes
[3:19:43] jay2seam: Stop policing PD and officers, police the streets and criminals.
[3:19:44] x_juiceman: Ruth has caused some issues especially regarding daps and punishments but it’s also on the other captains to keep her check which they haven’t… partly due to Turner being on LOA and Slacks wanting to maintain unity among the captains. So hard to argue Max is not warranted in wanting to provide some oversight
[3:19:45] Galileothe1: dont the captains just do what management asked them to do at the start
[3:19:45] Chrissy1337: Ruth is not the main rpoblem no
[3:19:46] Lepaca: so many ruth bad because my strimmer said so parrots LUL
[3:19:48] tangobish: imo ruth is the best rp on the server shes created so much
[3:19:49] ConstyUK: People need a bit of freedom to play their characters (within reason).
[3:19:49] Kenderssss: i think its how she says things
[3:19:50] StephyFace: Too many ppl place it all on Ruth, when there's 2 other captains at play here just as involved and in agreement with things people are upset about lol
[3:19:50] Chrissy1337: its all 3 captains
[3:19:50] Lucsvm: DENZEL OMEGALUL
[3:19:50] kreljos: nah people just like having someone to blame, its always going to be someone, Baas wasn't root of all problems either
[3:19:53] imas101: @twistedstreams don’t stream must equal not around
[3:19:54] Gigass: nopixel people clashing with ruth because she is playing in wildrp mentality thats why she is out of most people comfortable zone
[3:19:55] Satic: It's hilarious to see how rent free she is
[3:19:58] 1CaptainRedBeard1: She's not the problem with everything but the city (civs/crims) often associate her with the problems in PD.
[3:19:58] touchpaduser5678: she needs to be ocean dumped only solution
[3:20:01] st3adyguy: DAPs should fall off earlier, its very concerning for people always scared of accumulating DAPs to get suspensions
[3:20:02] Lupusdeus: Nah she isn't, she's a good heel tho, King hasn't seen a side of her that others have IMO
[3:20:02] thestolentimes: From watching all the streams she tries to back stab people she doesn't like
[3:20:04] lightwarrior2088: I think problem is more complicated big picture. Different visions conflicting
[3:20:04] comrade_rabbitt: she currently steam rolls the other captains
[3:20:06] KingKova: No because it's the fault of all other Captain's for not doing their job and keeping Ruth in check
[3:20:06] batperson: On the nopixel wiki under brooke ruth it says "She is known to lie, gaslight and assume the worst about others without any proof to advance her personal agenda."
[3:20:11] Strongdad: <message deleted> by Ruth
[3:20:11] Istaf_SC: "RuTh DoSnEt  LiKe My StEaMeR! ShE ProBleM!"
[3:20:13] evilmnkey4: its Den Quincy LUL jk
[3:20:14] evil_bullett: communication has been the biggest downfall of the PD since i started watching roll play fixing that would help alot
[3:20:16] OdilonRedonn: for me the root of the problem is content cops vs serious cops. they cant coexists clearly
[3:20:16] SteelMintMedic: I think a lack of funding in the beginning is really driving the frustrations and the DAPS and personal interactions is the tipping point
[3:20:18] Sieber13: She is the morale problem because she pushes punishment in cases where Turner and Slacks do not see it as needed.
[3:20:18] Lucsvm: @touchpaduser5678 you know that dont do anything right?
[3:20:19] lightwarrior2088: pd needs prosecutors to help with correct charges
[3:20:22] retrost1: essentially need a second skeleton crew of past cops or people with new characters who had past cops that could be fast tracked to officer. PPO is taking too long for people especially someone with previous experience
[3:20:23] robertsmithjr: absolutely, i dunno how she hasnt disappeared she is rent free in so many heads that she has to be extremely thin
[3:20:23] Picklz: Ruth is a percieved problem to alot of outside parties So alot of blame falls on her which hurts PD image when defended tbh
[3:20:23] CuBanMumzy: @robertsmithjr yup can't win for losing as the saying goes. The PD down bad start has not been understood by alot. Not to mention the different vision from 3.0.
[3:20:25] cuccumberz: some of these people definitely feel like they are just parroting what they hear on other streams and not actually forming their own opinions
[3:20:26] daLight: We're 3 months in and I feel like a lot of people see her as worse than Wrangler already

[3:20:43] jay_jaymann: unpopular opinion, I think the police who got daps like denzel improved their policing a lot. he just got unlucky with that last pit

[3:23:15] ElGeuso: I heard she has horns and a tail
[3:23:16] Panos_97: Good RP, bad for PD
[3:23:17] MDM4ever1986HD: she likes to have yes men like Slacks
[3:23:23] Gigass: mentality difference is the problem its content and rp mix server but ruth full serious rp mode i think both great but people clash understanding that
[3:23:25] 0liver1891: Ruth have been great for rp
[3:23:28] Myiuss: ruth is a problem but she's good RP
[3:23:28] Lepaca: my streamer said so, and my streamer is a flawless god Madge
[3:23:28] thestolentimes: It is good RP but she should be gotten rid of if caught in that RP
[3:23:32] jgmarshall3: Problem she didnt have any resistance.
[3:23:33] Lupusdeus: Right but that's a fair reason for a viewer to think she's a bit of a heel right?
[3:23:35] comrade_rabbitt: She *had* no counter
[3:23:37] Istaf_SC: People need to realize Ruth is AMAZING for RP. But a terrible leader
[3:23:37] the92bulls: James Randall should be sheriff
[3:23:39] daLight: Antagonist RP is good RP
[3:23:40] MDM4ever1986HD: assuming
[3:23:41] MartMonster: you asked for what needs to happen to fix PD, not to make good RP snow Kappa
[3:23:43] ultimamaxima: actions speak louder than words
[3:23:44] Nobbleberry: swan peepoHappy
[3:23:45] Phoenix_Rised: I heard Daps got Daps for giving too many daps.
[3:23:45] Daywalkerblade: Seems like you are punished the more you are on duty
[3:23:51] slendom: swan is so cool Gladge
[3:23:55] EmrysorMerlin: @nobbleberry she so cool
[3:23:56] phinn01: shes so cool
[3:23:56] cuccumberz: Aldo is not what I’d call a yes man and I see her speaking with him and coming to him with things a lot
[3:24:00] lightwarrior2088: Dabb adding a review process for firing is good and mimics IRL
[3:24:01] tangobish: shocker rp chat cant handle conflict
[3:24:02] FlGJAM: We wouldn't have all this entertainment without people like Ruth/Cheever
[3:24:06] Dee__1__: Ruth is awesome amazing character uhsLove
[3:24:08] tcuique: i think the general sentiment is there are kinks where it feels off like that statute of limitation is shorter than dap falloff
[3:24:11] CuBanMumzy: the word ruth is banned in Saab channel if that says how toxic people get. Rent free
[3:24:13] Lupusdeus: @FlGJAM absolutely
[3:24:19] Lucsvm: PepeLaugh
[3:24:24] NealWilliam: LUL
[3:24:26] BurgGolf: I think everyone is trying to find a line betweren how to allow for funny RP and maintaing dignity in the PD but Ruth has zero flexibility on that
[3:24:27] sonadapop: the spirit of the law is just as important
[3:24:28] CypherCosmo: WAYTOODANK
[3:24:32] Andrewb1694: kinamaLUL
[3:24:33] Idejder: Snow, do you think there is a line where cops feel like they cant be cops because they are looking over their shoulder afraid of DAPs? Have you felt that way on a chase or during a high prio call so far?
[3:24:33] CypherCosmo: radio too loud
[3:24:37] lightwarrior2088: ya daps how ruth issues them should fall off after 30 days
[3:24:38] MDM4ever1986HD: @FlGJAM 100% Saabb/Slacks is great as well as Esfanfd/Cornwood
[3:24:39] thestolentimes: And she did threaten to take over the council and said the PD was a body of Government which it isn't. It's great RP no doubt.
[3:24:42] EmrysorMerlin: Cops are the villians and as a top dog she becomes the main villian
[3:24:56] HaraSea: It seems difficult for officers to explain their side of things once the captains have made up there mind...but that being said a lot of the DAPs given were deserved. I do like creative punishment tho.
[3:25:02] Lucsvm: if Ruth got fired the PD drama is over Sadge
[3:25:03] Lordminiw: Good Afternoon
[3:25:07] ConstyUK: Ruth is amazing, her RP creates so much. But might not have been the best for a newly formed PD. Maybe a few months in once it was more developed.
[3:25:17] Wahlle: Ruth is not the main issue, but its a super strict charachter who punishes anything out of the book, shaping the PD after it in a RP server might not be the best fit imho. "Forcing npc behaviour" could be solved with more "comic" cops in a 2nd force but its too early
[3:25:18] Tigerfreeze: Lordminiw, sureHEY
[3:25:21] NGVtv: Cops are evil Smadging
[3:25:26] MDM4ever1986HD: didn't she mention that all the things Cornwood did wrong like most of the daps had already fell off
[3:25:30] psylongti: Maybe a second skeleton crew of FTOs to increase the pipeline
[3:25:33] lightwarrior2088: Mayor: “PD is the biggest gang in Los Santos”
[3:25:35] thestolentimes: That's the problem Ruth's RP killed the good PD RP
[3:25:45] Idejder: But if you are on shift for 8 hours and you have to call off every chase you are in, that would build up and you end up not coming back? Could that be part of it for people?
[3:25:45] slendom: yo Smadging is a great emote
[3:25:46] ShhLackEe: i feel for esfand /cornwood he looks like hes not having a good time anymore with slacks and ruth...i hope he pushes for commish
[3:25:47] MexiBrent: @MDM4ever1986HD no only one fell off
[3:25:49] TheDaveCExperience: DAPs falling off after 30 days instead of 60 would be a good start
[3:25:49] Studio_Karli: I don't get to come around too often but it's good to see Jackie got back into the PD! uhsLove
[3:25:55] MDM4ever1986HD: @MexiBrent which one fell off?
[3:25:57] Walla_x: @HaraSea I miss the creative punishments. Like when they used to make officers patrol beaches, or be bicycle cops, etc. Was always good RP
[3:26:00] Nerfmeh1: peoples opinion get heavily effected by other povs they watch
[3:26:00] Pallywally: you forgot to say "back 10-8" Kappa
[3:26:02] Studio_Karli: Oh lol
[3:26:02] cuccumberz: I feel like people are acting like it’s incredibly easy to get DAPs when it really isn’t that easy
[3:26:03] Prollos: @thestolentimes define good PD roleplay?
[3:26:04] Lupusdeus: RP viewers struggle to distinguish characters from streamers, it's weird AF
[3:26:08] Studio_Karli: Sorry!
[3:26:09] pearjuice: @ShhLackEe he cant be commisioner, isn't senior officer
[3:26:10] robertsmithjr: @CuBanMumzy exactly, everyone wants everything fixed, the initial plan from what i understand was for it to be a slow roll out, but everyone wants everything done at once, has things been perfect no, but i also think a lot of people have been soft, and want consequences until they are hit with the consequences then its to much, and people feel targeted and picked on, the other side of the coin is if people are doing what they are suppose to their not going to be getting daps
[3:26:16] TorqueX: I love the rp but I feel like if the other rp'ers are feeling a certain way, then it becomes a problem.
[3:26:27] Studio_Karli: I should have read the title again haha my bad
[3:26:28] EnergyM1: DAPS should be used for Training/learning not just firing employees
[3:26:30] OutKhastlive: How would Jackie react to Max being mayor?
[3:26:39] MotherGoose6587: @uhSnow Would you consider bringing snow back to PD if asked?  I feel Snow's respect from city and fellow officers would help.
[3:26:42] Cuuley: but what if it's been 10 whole minutes? lol
[3:26:44] AntiTarheel: I think once punished for daps 1-3 w/ 24 hr suspension, those daps shouldnt be used in the count towards another suspension.
[3:26:46] Lucsvm: ppl want that Mr K dont get fuck for have a PD gun, Denzel for pit 100mph into a civ, Cornwood keep shooting in a down suspect. KEKW
[3:26:48] thestolentimes: Good as in the PD being good in the RP cities eyes. The RP city hates the PD now because of what they are doing to Den and Cornwood. It's great content no doubt.
[3:26:55] Airt1: Mayor Max's thing about DAPs is that the same people reviewing them and enforcing suspensions are the same people applying them
[3:26:58] Puk3s: They seem to do that a lot less now
[3:26:59] Sieber13: @pearjuice The wording is kinda vague. It doesn't really specify if it is current Senior, or have ever been a Senior.
[3:26:59] proplayerbmb11: i think you guys just need to do a mass hiring and then not afraid to fire bad cops who do bad work
[3:26:59] Istaf_SC: Something else I think people who bring up the "This is RP" line regarding some of this stuff is if the RP isn't fun people won't want to do it. So maybe the direction of the PD just isn't for this server
[3:27:10] MDM4ever1986HD: What would Jackie think of Ruth, Slacks and Turner?
[3:27:11] Kenderssss: i dont think there is a middle ground on daps an cops having some fun
[3:27:14] MexiBrent: @MDM4ever1986HD i dont really remember which one exactly sorry
[3:27:21] AntiTarheel: Nowhere in the world would a police officer enter a review without a representative
[3:27:22] MDM4ever1986HD: @MexiBrent no worries
[3:27:28] ergofoe: if you think about it, Ruth single handedly created the best RP arcs for Mayor/PD/Crims 5Head
[3:27:29] pearjuice: @Sieber13 oh yeah, the old "but in the old republic" card, I don't think it will work personally lol
[3:27:32] thestolentimes: I'm just enjoying the RP ride. I view this as a TV show.
[3:27:32] uselesscanteen: @AntiTarheel yeah need union reps
[3:27:36] Sahil6255: any plans on playing cop on ONX ???
[3:27:46] Istaf_SC: do something moon2GIGA
[3:27:47] ShhLackEe: @Istaf_SC  yeah you can see in esfands face yesterday he wasnt having fun anymore...never heard him yell either so that was interesting
[3:27:51] jay2seam: Issue is that PD is policing their own selves rather than the streets/criminals. Solution is easing off own PD punishments to allow improvement of officers, rather than loss of officers' employment.
[3:27:57] Fast_doughnut: Maybe it should be senior officers giving daps and captains reviewing them
[3:27:58] StreamElements: There are bots currently going around Twitch whispering you about giveaways. These giveaways are a scam. DO NOT CLICK ANYTHING, just report them to Twitch and block them!
[3:28:00] cocolori1: I think the issue is the same as in 3.0 where different shifts have different feels and it doesn't really work to try to set a single standard for all of them. That isn't a solution because then there is inconsistency. But then I think inconsistency should be welcomed to an extent. It would also just help with more officers
[3:28:03] Lupusdeus: @Istaf_SC Definitely felt like Esfand was struggling a bit with everything yesterday, like he said parts of it werent fun and it was getting too serious - as much as he knows it's a great storyline.
[3:28:04] proplayerbmb11: 3 months
[3:28:16] smd_junior: I think also with daps it they should fall off based on hours on duty, those putting in long hours are more at risk to accumulate them
[3:28:17] thestolentimes: The problem is the Captain's RPing isn't fun for the PD
[3:28:18] psylongti: Yeah, 3 months was a big problem in that conversation
[3:28:22] ALFE_: First step is getting a commissioner that won't sit on the fence about making changes, having 3 people in charge with different opinions make changes difficult
[3:28:26] Istaf_SC: @ShhLackEe He said he wasn't having fun because he doesn't like such intense RP
[3:28:28] sendu6666: they need to be way too longsteady and
[3:28:31] slendom: all this with treason / murder / cornwood isnt helping the actual timeline of getting things sorted for the PD
[3:28:34] slendom: its distracting
[3:28:35] MDM4ever1986HD: @ShhLackEe I really feel for Esfand and Saab it's really affecting both of them aren't having fun
[3:28:42] cuccumberz: also we saw what over hiring did in 3.0 so it’s definitely a balance
[3:28:45] x_juiceman: A character like Cornwood can’t exist within a PD where Ruth is in charge. He can’t RP as he would like because he’ll be overly punished for silly things
[3:28:51] Kenderssss: @Lupusdeus thats a problem of a cause of his own making
[3:28:56] comrade_rabbitt: 3 months is unacceptable lol
[3:29:03] jay2seam: Issue is that PD is policing their own selves rather than the streets/criminals. Solution is easing off own PD punishments to allow improvement of officers, rather than loss of officers' employment.
[3:29:04] MDM4ever1986HD: @x_juiceman 100% they're polar opposites
[3:29:06] Lucsvm: @x_juiceman Cornwood and Ruth dindt even interact
[3:29:08] Lucsvm: OMEGALUL
[3:29:12] VolenoVehro: I'm still new to this, how long has 4.0 been a thing?
[3:29:12] Istaf_SC: @Lupusdeus And to be clear I'm not just talking about Esfand (Tho hes kind of at the center of it) a lot of cops seem to have an issue
[3:29:13] TwistedStreams: @x_juiceman I agree
[3:29:15] BurgGolf: Do you feel the captains are looking out for the officers or their own ass (aka trying to prove they are being effective)
[3:29:17] eri_frost: HE EXISTS
[3:29:18] phinn01: Pog
[3:29:19] ben0809: Pog
[3:29:20] MDM4ever1986HD: Cornwood is about integrity unlike Ruth
[3:29:22] Krimson07_: @x_juiceman have you heard of character development
[3:29:24] MDM4ever1986HD: kill the moth
[3:29:24] StephyFace: LUL
[3:29:24] ianakaBoogie: POGGERS
[3:29:26] Picklz: brian check the legislation Prayge
[3:29:26] thestolentimes: Actually, Cornwood's RPing as a policeman on the street is way more fun to watch then the current RP
[3:29:27] kerndeezy: little texas PepeHands
[3:29:30] evilmnkey4: ewww moths
[3:29:33] Sahil6255: knight AINTNOWAY
[3:29:34] Kasvar: SnuPoint gtfo moth!
[3:29:34] Gigass: he is such a troll
[3:29:34] StarWhistle517: uhsDAD
[3:29:35] the92bulls: cornwood is pog
[3:29:35] Lucsvm: I think that in 2 months Cornwood talk to Ruth like 2 times KEKW
[3:29:35] robertsmithjr: they have to have the bodies to fill those roles also, putting someone in the position who is still not sure how to even be a cop, you dont want to push them to fast, and they are hiring people but less then 50% return after academy, thats not a pd issue, thats a people issue
[3:29:37] daLight: Did he just yell at a moth? kinamaLUL
[3:29:38] AntiTarheel: no police discipline without representative for officer
[3:29:41] OdilonRedonn: bro during the the review they gave Cornwood ZERO leniency and moved to ask a prosecutor to investigate him for fucking murder
[3:29:41] Stealthkillah122: @kerndeezy fingi
[3:29:41] salveck: Cornwoods character requires a lot of leeway for sure
[3:29:43] FSouza_01: Brian Knight is here to save PD POGGERS
[3:29:46] Lupusdeus: @Kenderssss disagree :)
[3:29:49] MDM4ever1986HD: @daLight KEKW
[3:29:58] phinn01: Mehdi Gladge
[3:29:59] Lucsvm: EZ
[3:30:09] eri_frost: and then tuggz is perfect troll
[3:30:13] Myiuss: oh yeah knight screwed cornwood big time
[3:30:14] skimomoula7: Lil tuggz is so funny
[3:30:15] Lupusdeus: would like to see more Nino around, love that character
[3:30:23] AnonymousVodka: Modge
[3:30:27] Myiuss: <3 mehdi aswell
[3:30:29] thestolentimes: Here is the main problem with Ruth's RPing. She killed Cornwoods RP because he can't joke like his character wants or he's fired.
[3:30:29] pearjuice: the aziz and knight situation was a bit too much for me, but yeah mehdi is great
[3:30:39] kerndeezy: @Stealthkillah122 FakOFF here have my pistachio shells HoldThis
[3:30:42] Dee__1__: Brian created chaos and dipped LUL
[3:30:46] evilmnkey4: Drip act violation
[3:30:46] Murdernation69: Ruth is the joffery lanister of no pixel
[3:30:49] BfAleTitan: yea the Aziz/Cornwood/Knight situation went too far
[3:30:56] Prollos: the issue with having a cornwood with less restrictions compared to others is you build resentment within the PD super fast, happened all the time in 3.0 with characters like pred getting away with stuff whilst others got punished over minor things
[3:31:06] MDM4ever1986HD: @thestolentimes Do you think it's her or Slacks is ruining Esfand's persona?
[3:31:11] Sahil6255: some uhsSTIRRING time with brian knight PepeLaugh
[3:31:24] thestolentimes: I think it's her and Slack is stuck with the shit on his face in the RP
[3:31:25] EnergyM1: @BfAleTitan its to late doesnt matter now!
[3:31:27] Lucsvm: luda chris
[3:31:28] StreamElements: PLEASE DO NOT BACKSEAT COP/GAME! Snow is playing the game and he doesn't need your help! There is plenty of other things to talk about in chat :)

[3:31:42] BfAleTitan: @EnergyM1 yep the damage is done
[3:31:47] MDM4ever1986HD: @thestolentimes Slacks is wrapped around her little finger
[3:31:55] thestolentimes: He asked us what we thought....
[3:31:58] MDM4ever1986HD: KEKW
[3:32:03] x_juiceman: @thestolentimes agreed, slacks doesn’t want to to go against Ruth which contributes to the problem
[3:32:05] MDM4ever1986HD: what you make of Aziz? wish you could interact with him
[3:32:14] KeiKeiNi: @thestolentimes @thestolentimes I disagree, Ruth enabled so much RP for Cornwood
[3:32:18] EnergyM1: @BfAleTitan i feel bad for corn but it made alot of RP
[3:32:33] Lucsvm: GIVE HIM A FELONY MadgeLate
[3:32:52] TwistedStreams: Did the council make Red Lights = Stop Signs yet?
[3:33:00] thestolentimes: @KeiKeiNi She totally did but it also killed the funny Cornwood RPing and turned it totally serious
[3:33:01] exonoraye: @uhSnow i luv ssaab but hes just not good in the top spot, he destroyed the Lspd in 6 months on Baas, demoralized the entire PD on Axel Justice in 4 months, demoralized the entire PD on Slacks in 3 months.
[3:33:03] MDM4ever1986HD: I love Esfand's commitment he's one of the best grinders on NoPixel I've seen and Ruth is runing it
[3:33:10] Stealthkillah122: @the_only_tetra hecker
[3:33:21] WildWillie419: capital jaywalking when?
[3:33:22] OdilonRedonn: for me the root of the problem is content cops vs serious cops. they cant coexists clearly

[3:33:53] evilmnkey4: jaywalking decriminalized
[3:34:00] salveck: @MDM4ever1986HD mostly because of the shitty DAP system, if there would be any warnings instead of insta DAPs this would balance much better
[3:34:15] Picklz: i like that theres way more civs

[3:34:37] thestolentimes: I didn't think NoPixel wasn't HC RPing is it?
[3:34:39] Bakemaan: chat not disconnecting people from their characters classic
[3:34:48] Istaf_SC: Esfand and Saab are even IRL friends lol
[3:34:52] MDM4ever1986HD: btw what is HC?
[3:34:55] combattingjosh: Did you see the DM someone sent him last night? @uhSnow LOL
[3:34:59] MDM4ever1986HD: @Istaf_SC YEP
[3:35:02] BfAleTitan: @thestolentimes NoPixel PD is HC RP, rest of the server is not lol
[3:35:03] thestolentimes: Yeah, people that turn this shit against the stream is crazy. Esfand and Ssaab are friends lol
[3:35:06] MDM4ever1986HD: Oh right

[3:35:30] ShhLackEe: crime is illegal as cornwood says
[3:35:35] thestolentimes: It's RP watch it like a show
[3:35:37] robertsmithjr: that wouldnt be fair to other officers who dont have the ability to work as many hours, not everyone can stream for a living, and have families
[3:35:39] MDM4ever1986HD: it's a fucking game

[3:37:00] Panos_97: Can't please 'em all, every time
[3:37:01] MDM4ever1986HD: BasedGod
[3:37:05] thestolentimes: Ssaab is great ....
[3:37:07] ar0jit: -1000 speach
[3:37:14] tedium7: @NarwhalArgy NODDERS joseph arrowhead did this
[3:37:18] jsonderuloh: also nobody here is privvy to the conversations in the background that he's being told how to run the PD
[3:37:22] Lucsvm: 7$ gas
[3:37:25] MDM4ever1986HD: What would you do as captain in Saab's postion?
[3:37:34] NarwhalArgy: @uhSnow He said multiple times ooc that he just wants to be a regular cop
[3:37:44] WildWillie419: Mayor taking over Pd would be a vacation for Slacks saabKEK
[3:37:45] Panos_97: Plus other captains have IRL stuff so Ssaab has had to deal with stuff alone
[3:37:58] sendu6666: it's like blaming Jack Nicholson for playing Jack Torrance
[3:38:03] Witzz_: it sucks some people cant realize that the streamers are playing characters and its not their actual person in game.
[3:38:13] thestolentimes: The Slack character is amazing RPing.
[3:38:17] StarWhistle517: ott uhsLove
[3:38:19] Neverywhere: the excitement in Ssaab's voice when he got through captain things a few days ago as he asked chat, "We can go on patrol now, chat?? Really??" confirms what you said, Snow nodd
[3:38:22] MDM4ever1986HD: @Panos_97 Yeah I feel for Xiceman his dad's got shingles very painful
[3:38:23] the_only_tetra: You can please some of the people all of the time, you can please all of the people some of the time, but you can’t please all of the people all of the time

[3:38:47] Theburkeinator: shingles are no joke
[3:38:54] x_juiceman: @uhsnow new here btw… not too familiar with your character. What’s Albert’s backstory?
[3:38:55] Lupusdeus: I think he's doing well with it from what i can see, he indicated that the whole storyline might be the start of a new arc soon which sounded cool
[3:38:57] MDM4ever1986HD: OTT uhsClap
[3:39:00] Mitashkii: a King talking to a King Clap
[3:39:00] robertsmithjr: yeah i can see it that way, im not saying he is a bad person or anything, ssaabs great, i wouldnt want to be in his position @uhSnow
[3:39:03] FSouza_01: Ngl sometimes I still don't get how Saab is capable of handling all the hate that he gets, the guy tanks a lot saabSuffer
[3:39:04] Panos_97: @MDM4ever1986HD It sucks, I miss the guy more than I thought I would. He's amazing
[3:39:04] Stealthkillah122: @the_only_tetra please this Sussy
[3:39:07] Dee__1__: He just wants to investigate crime, but management wants him running PD
[3:39:09] 00Elite: Feels like Saab also goes main tank when he sees someone else getting heat
[3:39:10] thestolentimes: Yeah, shingles are no joke. I hope they get well My mother suffered from ti.
[3:39:11] EmrysorMerlin: @evil_bullett I thought I pressed enter than realised it was you lol
[3:39:12] thestolentimes: it*
[3:39:12] MDM4ever1986HD: @Panos_97 Yeah he is
[3:39:26] PWRslide2: My realization of RP as a noob is that the Captain role is an actual job and the balance there for RP is super tough bc of a new/building server/season
[3:39:29] Lucsvm: ReallyMad MY STRIMER
[3:39:32] Istaf_SC: I like Saab a lot as a streamer. Been watching him since 2.0 days. But Slacks is kind of a moon2N character. He doesn't really seem to have hard opinions on things from what I've seen. Just kind of goes along with the other Cpts. Some Sr officers have stronger opinions than him on leadership matters.
[3:39:34] Witzz_: agreed
[3:39:35] Panos_97: We only shit on ERPers Kappa
[3:39:39] evil_bullett: @EmrysorMerlin ahahahaha nice uhsAh
[3:39:45] MDM4ever1986HD: Why would someone go out of their way just to talk shit about streamers? IQ of rocks
[3:39:47] thestolentimes: RP is like a tv show. I just sit back and watch what happens and laugh.
[3:39:55] TheShaunBro: It is easy for people to not be a dick
[3:40:12] halgot: @thestolentimes agreed
[3:40:23] MDM4ever1986HD: people say "welcome to the internet" but just don't be an asshole
[3:40:24] Lucsvm: @Istaf_SC he say Slacks is a "paperwork cop" sinse day one
[3:40:30] NarwhalArgy: I feel bad for Slacks though, he's getting shit for the other captains
[3:40:31] alliballibeee: @thestolentimes This 👏🏻
[3:40:32] Neverywhere: @thestolentimes RP is better! Imagine being able to shout to Dr. Drake Ramore that he forgot his tools inside a patient KEKW
[3:40:33] pearjuice: @TheShaunBro for RP chatters it's really hard
[3:40:42] thestolentimes: I've found a lot of great streams through watching this RP. It's fun watching the different view points. Better than anything on TV that's for sure lol
[3:40:42] Witzz_: I remember ruth saying something about warrants and saying she can write them while shes in bed so yeah it seems like a full time job
[3:40:45] Mitashkii: "invested" maybe LUL
[3:40:46] Theburkeinator: trying to get clips
[3:40:55] StarWhistle517: hows the Ethiopian caterpillar? uhsStir
[3:41:02] Littlebootz: slacks is the rp tank. let him cook :P
[3:41:05] Kermamakkara: @NarwhalArgy he is also intentionally pushing himself into that position

[3:41:35] EmrysorMerlin: @stealthkillah122 excuse me
[3:41:37] jesscdcc: is been a banger man the rp has been spicy
[3:41:40] M4ck3Y_5: who are you watching for RP?
[3:41:47] Lupusdeus: being in a position of power like head of police etc must take a toll IRL
[3:41:48] Lawlington: probably an unpopular opinion but if you need to do additional cop "work" out of game its a sign of the PD being run inefficiently
[3:41:50] thestolentimes: Thank you for the great content uhSnow. Not enough people thank the hours the streamers put in.
[3:41:51] MDM4ever1986HD: Esfand is such a great Rp'er and he grinds the hell every day for all of us yet there those who bad mouth him
[3:41:51] Panos_97: Dunno what the plan is for the stubble but the moustache rocks
[3:41:56] TheShaunBro: Off Topic but how is Teddy? @uhSnow

[3:42:08] Lucsvm: you are always on Ssaab chat
[3:42:08] NarwhalArgy: @Kermamakkara True but that's not a whole lot he can do about it since the two other captains are still equal
[3:42:12] Maiks: Nikez cop character has been really funny to watch
[3:42:14] monkz89: esfand brought the cornwood anger yesterday outside of PD, was wild

[3:58:29] robertsmithjr: @MDM4ever1986HD and thats not even any hate, i think cornwood is a fun character, but i also think he takes advantage of his friendship with slacks, and is looking for special treatment because he works a lot of hours, that wouldnt be fair to any other officer

[4:06:08] MDM4ever1986HD: @robertsmithjr Was this from last night? I mean I live in the UK and usually go bed quiet late and my body clock fucks me over on how good the RP has been
[4:06:17] jadetortoise: robertsmithjr cornwood style good faith / poor SOP policing is a bit at odds with the current captains vision, and normally I could see him being kicked out for it. However the low morale and pressure from the mayor seems to be flipping the script

[4:11:26] sabachku: vadeOof
[4:11:39] jadetortoise: MDM4ever1986HD if getting 10 DAPs is all that's needed to lose your job, then all officers are always in danger of losing their jobs. That's what you get when you prioritize SOPs over intent.
[4:11:43] Kasvar: are you allowed to pit an old man? Hmm

[4:12:14] Dswizzle00: this all has the potential to establish qualified immunity for officers, wouldn't want to be on the wrong side of that one lol
[4:12:15] robertsmithjr: @jadetortoise the thing is take hmmm i dunno bell, she has been a great officer and been doing great police work, but would she be given the same pass that people want cornwood to get, i honestly dont think so
