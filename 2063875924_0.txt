[4:28:44] nobodybodon: the long grass is a visual thing

[4:29:22] JoeayIV: its like
[4:29:26] JoeayIV: a photoshop brush
[4:29:34] JoeayIV: its a type of paint on the ground
[4:29:44] nobodybodon: that sounds like a whole lot of speculation
[4:29:45] JoeayIV: thats sorta how like
[4:29:51] nobodybodon: you're like, 3 layers deep in it there KEKW
[4:30:04] JoeayIV: bruh thats been a thing since at least CnC

[4:30:51] JoeayIV: like how wheelchairs used to freak out on metal grates
[4:31:12] nobodybodon: right but you're assuming that the shader people are using the same logic as whoever programed the weed, and also assuming how the shader people even chose how/where to add long grass
[4:31:38] JoeayIV: green places are still green
[4:31:38] nobodybodon: does it even use attributes?
[4:31:42] nobodybodon: maybe its hand placed
[4:31:43] nobodybodon: IDK dawg
[4:32:10] nobodybodon: like, it could even be a texture swap from an existing grass texture in GTAV
[4:32:12] JoeayIV: most likely for the ground textures they just "replaced" the texture used in the brush
[4:32:18] JoeayIV: cuz its the same repeating texture
[4:32:55] JoeayIV: thats how cars work
[4:33:16] JoeayIV: like how the explorer would turn to dogshit the moment you got off road

[6:08:15] eh_side: I kind of get where devs are coming from in making you choose. It encourages people to work together. As well, If everyone can do everything, it ends up benefitting the people who already have the most resources and clout, and makes it harder for others to catch up.
[6:08:28] Hudson_Pain: It just always seemed in 3.0 the people that tried to stay legit, were fodder caught between cops n crims

[6:11:08] JadedHopeful: It's also a detriment to relations. It's not that people dislike you, its that you lose out on some bonding opportunities because you can't get involved in stuff and have to consistently decline if you wanna stay clean
[6:13:48] JadedHopeful: It's a similar problem to what I dealt with as a child. (not the staying clean/crime part, obviously). My family didn't have much money and so I couldn't join my friends with stuff due to not being able to afford it
