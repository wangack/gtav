[6:09:07] cashboyjay: @Ergastulums unfortunately not conversing with her isnt much of an option, and i dont really have an ex to elp smile
[6:09:25] NotReallyAScientist: @SARcasm19 he's got a nodule, he can't do the Jay's voice in the forseeable future, he is not going to kill Jay Que
[6:09:35] KydrouKair: @cashboyjay Not helping your case, but that exact situation happened to me with an ex, and in the end she really wanted us back, and me to be a vulture. Never happened.
[6:10:04] antosbla: yee7 for jay
[6:10:11] ripplemind: damn. jay adopted that LS accent after 8 years completely
[6:10:14] KydrouKair: What helped me avoid falling in love with everyone i met was realizing that obsession is stronger than love.
[6:10:23] antosbla: not kris but the cashboy
[6:10:28] Mars_nights: @notreallyascientist I normally give it a dust clean every 2 months so im gonna try it and see how it goes
[6:10:31] KydrouKair: But there's a problem with that theory of mine
[6:10:34] cashboyjay: @KydrouKair oof you kinda ate me up with that one
[6:10:35] SonMontu: @KydrouKair real Life
[6:11:06] NotReallyAScientist: @Mars_nights wuuuut, did I say something that made sense with this? om
[6:11:17] NotReallyAScientist: I do be kinda drunk
[6:11:26] Mars_nights: LUL
[6:11:58] KydrouKair: @cashboyjay i am a psychopath, i cannot fall in love unless i force it. so in my case it was easy to learn. It also means i cannot risk relationships with anyone i don't want hurting me
[6:12:16] tasteliketaro: the police knows your outfit now right? PepoThink
[6:12:24] NotReallyAScientist: its carnival here in brazil, do not judge me for being drunk on a monday KEKW
[6:12:51] cashboyjay: @KydrouKair HmmNotes i see i see
[6:13:35] KydrouKair: @cashboyjay Wanna know something incredibly hopeful? Everytime you fall in love with someone new, is stronger than any other love you had before. Why? Because your heart and mind need to REPLACE the former with something STRONGER.
[6:13:48] Ergastulums: Jay I feel bad cause I don't know what would help, but thanks for reading the situation pretty well Gladge but honestly space, even if its just minimizing things that remind me of them (their social media, etc) could help
[6:14:12] ripplemind: who we with?
[6:14:14] KydrouKair: If you don't feel you're MORE in love than before, it's just bound to end
[6:14:25] cashboyjay: idk i always found her attractive but never really considered her as a prospect but recently since weve been talking alot more + hanging out alot more and like something flipped where now im like oh like what if
[6:14:52] Hexcart: awww
[6:14:53] Ergastulums: peepoSmile
[6:15:27] epikHacker__: peepoSmile
[6:15:38] cashboyjay: @Ergastulums no worries jocie, just lookin for other perspectives tbh, i dont think i would do anything to ruin anything but its def crowding my mind currently
[6:16:18] KydrouKair: @cashboyjay I'd say "Take a Risk". It's Not a good idea, but maybe a nice date, one you wouldn't have with a friend, but not strong enough for a girlfriend. If it's awkward at any moment, you can stop. You're only risking yourself, and learning you are or not in love, or just "love a friend" can help you a lot.
[6:16:41] cashboyjay: like maybe this is just me being sad cause valentines day is around the corner so im like giga sad
[6:16:42] cashboyjay: but idk
[6:16:53] NotReallyAScientist: can we get rid of homies emote?
