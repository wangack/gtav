[0:35:44] LevelUpMindy: And on TV it’s much more regulated compared to social media
[0:35:44] ThaKrisp: i wonder how the proliferation of cameras and the quality of those cameras contributes. because 10 years ago they where so bad you had to guess what was going on

[0:36:02] Ntrpy__: i truly believe that in the future the generation of people who have had the instant connectivity to the internet will be seen as a new epoch of humanity.
[0:36:05] LD141: tiktok does that too for me
[0:36:11] docshaayy: They have figured out how to use it as a tool to divide. There are studies showing they purposely use these algorithms to polarize people.  They show you a few things you like then something that gets you worked up.
[0:36:13] Reniora_: Instagram's meta is kinda good
