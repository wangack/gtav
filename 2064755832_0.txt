[1:09:46] unwissender_ouro: @jxssedxnte well if youre as well versed with the game as him, its fine, but the real problem comes when you compress the quality. I did a run of Ultrakill with the absolute worst graphics possible and just inverted colours would have been speedrunnable without much difference

[3:06:00] preloadedmind: Cargo bob needs to go in the port first
[3:06:01] Bamb00z: @Jartran74 hardly anyone picked up anything after that mission tbf :D the weird part is just that you get instant 5 stars for picking up the flower pot in the hospital... because logic dysticDERP
[3:06:03] smolw1tch: Sussy
[3:06:03] harmlesscatto: then maybe spawn cargobob at the port to test?

[3:47:09] youshallloveeachother: I can't believe Trevor doesn't have anything to say to this guy

[3:48:38] TwikSisted: can you leave a C4 here pre-mission?
[3:48:40] troubledcatfur5: but if you put a sticky in post, will it stay there for when you get here?
[3:48:40] tnrxo_: ragdoll?

[3:49:32] laserframe: use explosives to get out
[3:49:34] j0hnwick420: I think you'll have a problem using the crane before activating the yellow marker at the bottom. You should test that.
[3:49:36] disrupt_huntz: CARGOBOB TIME

[3:52:59] Jartran74: dviperLoss
[3:52:59] Fossabot: @ido_8400, Please stop saying the same thing.
[3:53:03] ender8343: Doesn't the gantry moves side to side when moving the crates?
[3:53:09] Zerotronox: wouldnt it fall off while you move the crane?
[3:53:18] Olie_the_potato: @Jartran74 ohhh  so what can i do with them?
[3:53:22] faNduBBLez: u landed on a boat i think this will be easy peasy

[3:55:06] DustinEden: Holy hell this is gonna be cancer
[3:55:09] j0hnwick420: I think it won't let you use the crane before activating the yellow marker at the bottom. You should test that.

[3:55:43] BraveMicrobe38: imagine not having a bike in your ass
[3:55:43] Zerotronox: wouldn't the vehicles fall of while you moving the crane?
[3:55:43] AgentEagele: You don't have bikes in your ass?
[3:55:51] YouEverW0nderWhyWeAreHere: ok dviperNoted

[4:00:45] iamhot237: Turn the timer off
[4:00:47] AZZYdotGG: dont forget, everytime you move the crane left and right too, you'll knock the heli. An idea would be to get the cargobob (bigger) so it can be perched on either side of the crane.
[4:00:49] checkit5: Planes are involved now lol
[4:00:49] MachinaZombie: you should have made the challenge "less than 5 climbs"
[4:00:50] Jartran74: @drinkdietmoose It was not the suggestion, it was the spam
