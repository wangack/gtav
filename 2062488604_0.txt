Although phantosmia is most often idiopathic, it may be associated with nasal mucosal abnormalities, migraines, seizures, and neurocognitive or mood disorders.

[0:55:09] Securitytss: why not ask for a phone gp appointment tell them whats happening and then ask them if you can keep taking the meds
[0:55:18] solid_swede: There are online GP's who you can talk too about these things. They're not free but you can get a consultancy without leaving your home @wolfabelle
[0:55:22] Cephyric: Nah GPs prescribe antibiotics for absolutely nothing

[0:55:45] RGeneral24: YEP
[0:55:48] RGeneral24: it is similar
[0:55:50] silentstormuk: if you pull your earlobe does it hurt the inside of your ear?
[0:55:51] coolferb: you can ask for advice from your gp on the nhs app its pretty good
[0:55:53] RGeneral24: but can fast or super slow
[0:55:53] Twinnylouise: thenn the next day you cant get a appointment so you're in pain yes yes

[0:56:52] DarthVeigar: wolfaHii @rohailkhan12
[0:56:58] pointless197: do you guys have urgent care?
[0:57:05] ondema: the medicine probably has some sort of numbing agent so it is likely removing the pain but not treating the underlying issue
[0:57:07] CmdrPain: Happy Valentine’s Day @wolfabelle and chat wolfaL
[0:57:07] Thorekh: wolfaDespair
[0:57:08] Safe_Tea_Thirst: @pointless197 yeah but its not that urgent
[0:57:09] Iskalm: just make sure to go in before you start farming mushrooms
[0:57:12] Englandjessss7: urgent care is like a waiting room simulator for@hours
[0:57:14] Cephyric: Could also be phantom pains, better to leave it for a bit and see if it dies down
[0:57:18] magic_freak: And if it's the fungi again antibiotics won't work
[0:57:20] thantoscat: The headphones probably don't help
[0:57:23] jummper__: bend your eyes like this LOOKBOTH to look in your own ear 5Head

[0:57:26] Safe_Tea_Thirst: urgent care is sitting in A&E for 11 hours with kids screaming
[0:57:28] RGeneral24: fungal
[0:57:30] magic_freak: wolfaShrug
[0:57:35] RGeneral24: fungal is always more likely
[0:57:37] humanwaveform: wearing headphones all the time probably isn't helpful. Do you have open back ones so that there's not so  much moisture around your ear?
[0:57:38] Kohtalon_: fungal more likely if you had it before
[0:57:42] Iskalm: my sister always had problems
[0:57:42] pointless197: @Safe_Tea_Thirst ah, same here really. unless you make an appointment but those can take a bit too

[1:01:50] Englandjessss7: tbf it’s not like you go all the time
[1:01:50] stianvn: Can u get antibiotics, if u tell u had the same thing within 6-9 months or something?
[1:01:53] pewthy: I've sat years on shit waiting for it to get better and it never does the waiiiiiit
[1:01:54] happydaze86: thats why its better to go to your gp than a&e
[1:01:55] wiredgunslinger: wolfaHey Home from work.  Your ear again Belle? Don't hesitate.
[1:01:56] Kohtalon_: and then there's people who go to the doctor for every single cold and just get everyone else sick
[1:02:01] ChemicalPpt: I basically had to force Pewthy to go to A&E, then we found out she had pneumonia and sepsis. But that's an extreme case too
[1:02:02] Thorekh: @wiredgunslinger, wolfaHii
[1:02:03] iikivvi: idk how u guys can do that because if i feel any pain, i tell my parents straight away Shrug
[1:02:11] magic_freak: I understand but not going is more likely to waste resources if you get really ill.
[1:02:14] Cephyric: Basically every doctor that exists will tell you that they are there to help you and you should never feel bad for being concerned about your health

[1:02:28] jummper__: weed killer in your ear OMEGADANCEBUTFAST
[1:02:38] Cephyric: Yeah but those doctors are bad doctors
[1:02:41] thantoscat: They do NODDERS

[1:02:43] kingdomFX: DESKCHAN damn chat be convincing.

[1:30:22] StreamElements: Check out my new highlights channel! https://www.youtube.com/@wolfabellehighlights
