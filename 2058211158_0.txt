[2:00:00] Snow_Bow14: How are you doing reckless?
[2:02:36] Empirics_: How often in court cases do you know the outcome before the case is even submitted in court? Baring some sort of major fuck-up by one of the parties in question.

[2:04:00] laerin101: thats the hotdog meme!
[2:05:07] teph748: would a reasonable person expect to be stopped before entering and area there not allowed. even more so an area that has radiation?
[2:08:21] Alderain971: @teph748 Sure if this was real life where they would have emergency responce forces able to put up a quarintine zone in hours.  A reasonable person would understand that both mechanics and manpower cant do that in the server
[2:09:03] teph748: they had people there though
[2:09:13] Alderain971: also sorry that came off more agro than i meant it to
[2:09:23] TheeForsakenOne: Cops had two Scouts and two-four officers to cover the entire area around Humane Labs.
[2:09:40] TheeForsakenOne: They only got cones and barriers last week. LUL

[3:46:07] recklessgallifreyan: Aren't there like more animated emote slots now?
[3:46:22] bruhkewl: @mystic_drewman that or Hurt by Johhnny Cash may be the best cover I know
[3:46:24] mystic_drewman: I hope someone one day is in the trash can when it gets dumped 🤣 😂
[3:46:44] TheeForsakenOne: Some cops asked about it but then they dropped it. I guess because Sani drivers haven't annoyed them enough yet. Tow drivers tank all the heat.
[3:47:04] mystic_drewman: @bruhkewl great singer Johnny cash
[3:47:23] DeceitWithin: I can't hear this without seeing the skellies for every Halloween short
[3:48:14] bruhkewl: @mystic_drewman final one I would mention is Falling in Reverse - Last Resort
[3:48:16] mystic_drewman: I'm really curious now if that's even possible for someone to be in the trashcan when getting dumped and could it be a escape tactic
[3:48:36] TheeForsakenOne: It'd be cool if the city got messier if sani wasn't done regularly.
[3:48:40] DeceitWithin: @bruhkewl 100% Best cover, objectively. Even if you don't like the style, or like Johnny himself... People have to admit the scope of his cover was so much bigger than any other cover. Only close contender I can think of is Bad Wolves' version of Zombie
[3:49:00] mystic_drewman: @bruhkewl that I've not heard of I'll have to check into it
[3:49:05] TheeForsakenOne: Yeah something like that. Garbage bags and the like.
[3:49:28] DeceitWithin: Ronnie's cover of Last Resort was epic but... not on the level of Pain or Zombie, @bruhkewl
[3:50:30] DeceitWithin: Time to dodge cops in this fuckin semi
[3:50:37] bruhkewl: @DeceitWithin I will have to check them out for sure. I will still stand by Disturbed -Sound of Silence as the best all time

[3:52:30] mystic_drewman: Oooo you got a new car Gemma on the up dawg
[3:52:42] DeceitWithin: @bruhkewl That's one of my favs for sure. But def check Bad Wolves - Zombie out. They were originally going to make the song with the Cranberries singer Dolores, but she passed like 2 days before IIRC
[3:52:55] tyler_aqu: don't you hate it when you leave your box of materials in the glove box and they get stolen?
[3:52:58] DeceitWithin: So instead of recording with her, they turned it into a tribute song for her
[3:53:39] bruhkewl: @DeceitWithin I already have it queued on another tab
[3:53:52] mystic_drewman: Yeah I almost lost a box the other day myself but my puppers ran them off lol
[3:54:13] recklessgallifreyan: Tour bus WICKED
[3:54:23] DeceitWithin: @bruhkewl Hope you enjoy it nodd If you know the OG Cranberries song, you hopefully will like it
[3:54:38] TheeForsakenOne: Admiral, Fusilade or Sultan. Got to follow the meta, dawg.
[3:55:02] bruhkewl: @DeceitWithin 90's was my teenagae years so music from that era hits me deep in the feels

[3:56:54] JetstarSolar: has Gemma gotten in with a crew yet?
[3:56:56] DeceitWithin: @bruhkewl two covers to throw into that queue, not so much were the best of covers but just covers to hear to enjoy for what they are... Two Seether songs, one is Careless Whisper, a long known cover of George Michael... The other is I've Got You Under My Skin originally by Frank Sinatra AAAA
[3:57:13] theconvictedquokka: Noppere
[3:57:36] DeceitWithin: I legit can NOT hear this song without thinking of Sweetwater from BF Bad Company
[3:58:23] DeceitWithin: There was a promo trailer for Bad Company where Sweetwater sang this then Haggard interrupted
[3:59:05] DeceitWithin: We'll get a BC3 when DICE figures their shit out one day COPIUM
[3:59:59] DeceitWithin: Fun fact, btw, Occam... There hasn't been a BC3 (BC2 came out in like 2010) cause DICE is quoted as saying, "We're not sure what made that franchise so good, we can't figure out what made it so good, so we're not going to make a new one"

[4:55:45] Beruru: like a Simon says mechanic? the DOC starts the activity, people sign in like a job, the DOC can close the group. then they can pick an emote from a wheel and a duration, and your character has to copy them and do the same

[4:59:59] DeceitWithin: Yeah... That kinda was like a knife diggin into skin
[5:00:03] Beruru: can't do murder Sadge
[5:00:12] MeanMorbid: Make your own BBMC, with blackjack,  and fishing rods
[5:00:17] theconvictedquokka: We make bbmc
[5:00:18] mrsbee90: laaaaame
[5:00:24] Beruru: make the cult Gladge
[5:00:34] SunkenTrain: the thing is even if you didn’t get almost banned the wipe was going to happen very soon
[5:00:40] mrsbee90: @Beruru OMG YES!!!!
[5:00:49] DeceitWithin: you dealt with it like a class fuckin act, but at the same time, Gemma getting absolutely brutalized was sad, like Ed told Gemma... She was a yes Sadge
[5:01:05] recklessgallifreyan: You always start playing her an hour after everything starts to happen
[5:01:48] theconvictedquokka: Why we need a full Gemma day
[5:01:57] DeceitWithin: I'd say it was the opposite, it was kinda there for EVERY RPer but it was neutered
[5:02:05] aprilmoxt: Yes
[5:02:08] aprilmoxt: Yes I would
[5:02:10] Beruru: @mrsbee90 thank u. I am excited to have a choice in servers

[5:02:20] Chiracho: KEKW
[5:02:21] theconvictedquokka: occamSuffer
[5:02:37] DeceitWithin: A LOT of BBMC of 3.0 were there for Gemma being there in BBMC, sadly the arc was kinda fuckin murdered
[5:02:41] theconvictedquokka: OK dad
[5:02:49] Chiracho: i reckon she'd fit in with roach and his rag tag bunch
[5:02:55] mrsbee90: my face hurts from that joke
[5:02:57] Chiracho: just her meeting him in rp
[5:03:22] DeceitWithin: I wish history would've gone different
[5:03:45] recklessgallifreyan: Once Gemma meets people I'm sure things will be smoother
[5:03:51] Beruru: in another universe there was at least one person who said "maybe don't stab your wife"
[5:04:07] rachelkachel: the obvious solution is to bring all the bbmc folks over to onx occamSmile
[5:04:19] DeceitWithin: Like if Rockstar didn't push the GTA 6 trailer, maybe things would've gone different for dealin with all the things? Maybe?
[5:04:41] DeceitWithin: One of life's "Maybe?"'s
[5:04:42] RinoaHarKitty: I think Gemma and Ollie would be hilarious
[5:04:47] Beruru: @deceitwithin it was going to happen before the end of the year because of the new copyright rules
[5:05:05] Beruru: omg yes. please
[5:05:08] RinoaHarKitty: like I said...hilarious
[5:05:26] rachelkachel: occamLUL
[5:06:04] theconvictedquokka: Gemma Olli and Gemma's soon to be wife fauna
[5:06:21] theconvictedquokka: 2 or 3 days
[5:06:24] DeceitWithin: @Beruru Yeah, I know, but one conspiracy I kinda halfway like is the fact that NP 4.0 and ONX 1.0 was only really announced cause GTA 6 leaked... So maybe if GTA 6 didn't actually leak, ONX and 4.0 didn't have to be at that date... I know it's pure copium cause I still miss 3.0
[5:07:10] Beruru: hmmmmmm beruruWait
[5:07:14] LoneWolfRacing77: icu montag let the city fall apart while gemma causes chaos
[5:07:23] DeceitWithin: I'm sad that 3.0 stories ended where they did, and for other points, where storylines died
[5:07:32] rachelkachel: montag and katya get matching heart attacks?
[5:07:39] DeceitWithin: monkaS Askin Beru where stories go
[5:07:39] Beruru: chat already knows where I leaked it KEKW shhhhh

[5:07:59] DeceitWithin: Don't ask Beru where stories go, Occam, you don't wanna know AAAA
[5:08:25] aprilmoxt: Just go hunting with the Justices and forget to wear the vest
[5:08:45] theconvictedquokka: Heart attack he do be getting olf
[5:08:49] DeceitWithin: It happened 7 years ago and it was kinda weird
[5:08:51] Beruru: filing the serial numbers off
[5:09:05] DeceitWithin: so it's not FULL copyright
[5:09:19] Beruru: F
[5:09:28] recklessgallifreyan: o7

[5:12:02] Beruru: @deceitwithin when all of Lang's managers adore you, life is easier than it could be. blessed to have a new character that other roleplayers enjoy
[5:12:24] DeceitWithin: hmjj
[5:12:28] Beruru: @deceitwithin I haven't seen the brick but I've seen pictures on twitter
[5:12:39] SunkenTrain: put the new frog in the discord
[5:12:55] theconvictedquokka: ... I'm looking at it now of course it's poisonous
[5:13:12] Beruru: although I wish people would stop hearing my voice and asking me for decorating dyotiBruh
[5:14:02] DeceitWithin: @Beruru I could assume what the other message meant but I'm gonna be nice and just laugh at Gemma trying to figure out cars. and yeah, if you see Ziggy's car, it's a brick. it's like a 4 foot by 4 foot square... it goes fuckin 75mph on senora Despairge
[5:14:25] zoatanaka: dyotiLurk Ayo did someone say Decorating?
[5:14:42] recklessgallifreyan: occamBobble

[5:17:08] DeceitWithin: @Beruru Well, if we're talkin bout Ziggy, he has a Panto, can't even get into the car to upgrade.... so it legit has no upgrades to the engine, has no hood. He's thinkin of sellin it atm
[5:17:21] RinoaHarKitty: she do be tryin

[5:17:43] mystic_drewman: Stalking your victim 🤣 😂
[5:18:30] Chiracho: dude water slides with those bumps i refuse to go on. i went down one like it in spain and the bump sent me almost flying off the slide.
[5:18:37] Beruru: yessssss roller coaster tycoon
[5:18:51] DeceitWithin: @Beruru Nope, literally talked with Fury today at Mosley's, can't access the hood. So can't get an upgrade to the Panto, so it's a little box, you can change the tires, paint, etc, but... Actual performance? Nope. He's tryin to sell it AAAA
[5:18:58] Beruru: I learned how to make a coaster that goes faster and faster and never stopped today
[5:19:17] Beruru: @deceitwithin I.... did they check the back? the engine is in the back
[5:19:39] DeceitWithin: Yep, checked the back, and the front, the car doesn't have a hood
[5:19:48] Beruru: oof. bugstars time
[5:20:07] Beruru: it's better than actually installing the stuff to find out it's bugged and doesn't work though :)
[5:20:13] DeceitWithin: Fury was like "wait, it doesn't have a hood? Okay, let me go 'under' it" today at Mosleys
[5:20:49] DeceitWithin: It was like halfway fucked for repairs
[5:20:51] DeceitWithin: AAAA
[5:20:52] rachelkachel: screens for all occamHype
[5:20:54] Beruru: the panto really is one of the ultimate rat cars though on any server so like I think it makes up for it in hole squishy
[5:21:18] Beruru: you can put the panto and the brioso in basically any hole and you'll be fine
[5:21:40] DeceitWithin: Oh yeah, it's smol and fucks all of PD but

[5:26:21] Empirics_: You just dont have a list of prime numbers memorized?
[5:26:43] rachelkachel: @Empirics_ I do but only up to 100
[5:26:47] DeceitWithin: @Beruru  Let's be honest, the BEEoso would flatten the Panto any day of the week
[5:27:30] LoneWolfRacing77: ems when?
[5:27:33] DeceitWithin: Ask Collin about it

[5:56:27] Adeptus_Ministorum: cant call one in?
[5:56:36] rachelkachel: a flock of tow trucks swoops in, and a few minutes later the street is pecked clean
[5:56:56] aprilmoxt: Small claims court on the tow of that particular vehicle effecting your income
[5:57:27] Adeptus_Ministorum: its not bashed, dented, broken or scratched
[5:57:30] Adeptus_Ministorum: local

[6:08:39] mystic_drewman: It might be neat if locals would call in cars in middle of roads and obviously need towing directly to tow drivers
[6:09:15] mystic_drewman: Like when pd get calls
