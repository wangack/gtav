[1:32:30] JMercifo: rob sani price goes up makes robbing even more worth the cycle repeats
[1:32:38] Dorky1495: @CAPONE66420 prices went up before they started getting robbed, its the other way around
[1:32:39] lawnmowerman710: @killogic916 they do called Robbin them lol
[1:32:48] Dorky1495: people are less likely to pay your high price, and rob you instead
[1:33:00] conzfearacy12: @killogic916 clueless
[1:33:05] god__turkey: @Dorky1495 Sounds like they just gotta rob more people, no?
[1:33:05] U62charlie: I absolutely love the Devs doing this to hardened criminals.   also having story time with Tessa was soo good, she was so confused for so long and finally getting the unlock during her and Ks 40 min call was peak RP

[1:33:51] CAPONE66420: lol robbing sani just makes less mats which makes prices go up cause less stock lol
[1:33:59] daskaputtja: @u62charlie it's the best! I swear MLP will top Netlfix and smash YouTube here shortly ü§£
[1:34:10] FatKidWithRocks: @u62charlie I was locked in on Pony rp last night shotzLul
[1:34:11] conzfearacy12: @CAPONE66420 yep
[1:34:19] Va1ar_Morghulis: Looks like the robbing has increased the materials price.
[1:34:20] xG3TxSHOTx: the higher level sani workers will have less of the "lower quality" parts since they can choose what they get and obviously theyll always choose the most expensive in demand material
[1:34:31] killogic916: @CAPONE66420 demand is a bigger hit... trheres like 50k mats being made a day and like 5% of those get robbed
[1:34:31] RisKkeyy: There needs to be other ways to get mats than just sanitation. This is ridiculous

[1:35:50] Thormadn3ss: people were already charging 10-12 per before anyone was even robbed
[1:36:00] Wyborn24: @dustbug less people doing it now because they're getting robbed.  So, yes it is true
[1:36:06] getrektlosernerd: @jbarns122 you only get 4 each for 300 can get 10

[1:54:54] sleepyjoesdroolrag: Should bring in boosting or something as a btc job
[1:54:54] Daddy__Winston: @Nzlaten they should limit racks per house. easiest fix
[1:55:16] zaf_playz: @Nzlaten my bad KEKW
[1:55:32] Nzlaten: @killogic916 true but you know it means you need to do another mission to unlock the USB with the buttcoin or something you know like cleaning the cash
[1:55:52] stinkybilly02: Hired someone to clear cache
[1:56:08] B0ssman239310: you gotta have a brain first
[1:56:08] Nzlaten: @daddy__winston if they do limit it they need to reduce prices of the jobs and BPs
[1:56:12] zaf_playz: @Nzlaten you can buy from drone
[1:56:18] Nzlaten: @zaf_playz you good bro LUL
[1:56:45] Daddy__Winston: @Nzlaten no they will bring out 6080s that double up the 6060s
[1:57:04] zaf_playz: @Nzlaten nah i'm high LOL
[1:57:17] killogic916: @Daddy__Winston if that was a reward from heist it would be fine... but if its from more CB's thats just making the problem worse

[1:58:32] killogic916: @Shotz theres no world where people dont move this fast if theres an ability to. They need to limit progression rate if its not ready.
[1:58:43] sleepyjoesdroolrag: They really gotta get fixing the server lol
[1:58:48] Blank27: yeah.. people grind like crazy :O
[1:58:53] lurkinnnnn7: FACTS
[1:58:53] TnFD: its also good slow burn

[1:59:03] PwnUWithEz: Did Vinny see the fruits the bois left in the house for him/Tuggz?
[1:59:06] killogic916: @Shotz then the server should limit rack per house to like 10 and there is a limit.
[1:59:10] jeandale31: course sanitation is at choke point for the server

[1:59:28] death_walker007: u will fall behind bcz every group is grinding butt so everyone is at race cant blame anyone when the system us like that
[1:59:29] TnFD: rushing people into guns ruins servers
[1:59:37] rohailkhan12: house parking two cars go see them
[1:59:38] LaaRSR: @killogic916 People just buy more houses or racks @ friends
[1:59:38] QuackingtonEsq: I think it‚Äôs also because everyone feels if they aren‚Äôt first then they are last and someone else will reap the rewards and set the market of what‚Äôs to come
[1:59:42] Nzlaten: Also if buttcoin is 2k per the job payouts are nothing compared. Laundromat costs 150k in cash but pays out 22k in dirty money
