[1:22:46] hiicks_: Malicious prosecution is pretty simple, if there's no PC then it's not malicious
[1:22:46] giantpanda: Hi
[1:22:47] urkuri92: Oop
[1:22:49] Toastedgamer03: if cornwood didn't shoot donald bush but a cop was still trying to get a lawyer to prosecute a murder charge it would be malicious
[1:22:51] Minimumflunkey: Slacks male stripper arc madgeNOW
[1:22:51] Minijezuz: I blame Sam baas
[1:22:51] uselesscanteen: Someone stabs an officer, Many officers shoot the aggressor, one officer gets charged for murder.  You need a union to protect the officers from the captains
[1:22:53] thestolentimes: Cornwood saved your ass in the interview for treason
[1:22:55] buddha_hands: arthur is completely out of his mind OMEGALAUGHING

[1:22:58] Krimson07_: OMEGALAUGHING
[1:22:58] Istaf_SC: Wrong. Malice prosecution is when you press charges against someone I like ReallyMad
[1:22:59] arcswo: If Slacks didnt talk to lawyers and then the PD got sued, everyone would claim the PD was covering up crimes
[1:22:59] Flying_Floor: From other POVs Slacks clearly acted to push charges to obsolve PD from needing to fire CW themselves tho
[1:23:00] Killsauce: slacks literally said.... 'i want you on retainer '
[1:23:01] GoutOfWar: @Fightin_Amish no vigors is crane
[1:23:01] thewarth0g: cos you were trying to get it done so quick
[1:23:03] SeriousBeardCPC: but in fairness a week case that was being rushed
[1:23:05] iconwondr: @taraannee Oliver isn't conflicted on this issue. He was conflicted on something else because Cornwood paid him a retainer, he returned it but Baily advised him to stay away from that case
[1:23:05] urkuri92: whaaaaat LUL
[1:23:06] TacticalTangent: i think his reazon was the timing with the suspension and the 24 hours time

[1:23:12] pitkula: KEKW
[1:23:12] Count_Brennuvarg: @Ssaab It wasn't malicious, but when you don't have all the facts that the captains have and you only have a limited perspective, I could see why someone (cornwood) would think that
[1:23:12] layla109: lol
[1:23:13] FoxOnTheWall: lol

[1:23:19] JesusGVG: LMAOO but hes just a puppet right?
[1:23:19] VeninLUL: its about pushing for it and insisting. not just whether yyou think its truue or not
[1:23:20] ZPanda_MS: It's a really grey area, because its highly subjective. Would really like to see this situation argued in a court case.
[1:23:21] Fightin_Amish: @GoutOfWar No Crane is Nathan

[1:24:47] tinywulf: it looked hurried and rushed to me
[1:24:48] stillfresh82: Was a legit question
[1:24:48] thetwotypeking: actions have consequences
[1:24:49] Defonicx: @mad0monk bar complaint from slacks against this guy as this guy told the mayor everything him and slacks talked about in regards to possibly pressing charges on cornwood
[1:24:50] donschaefer: CAUGHT Its not that bad
[1:24:50] boobysmoke: how many daps is this for arthur
[1:24:50] SeriousBeardCPC: It's all based on perception IMO
[1:24:52] icarusdjr: thats not malice, it would be malice if Slacks said "we want to charge him with something"
[1:24:56] VenomVeinZ: WideSusge

[1:25:04] PsychoJoker: @stillfresh82 guy died of a gunshot wound to the head cornwood shot in his chest LUL
[1:25:04] WildWillie419: Arthur multiple times of his own volition said ‚ÄúCornwood was acting beyond the badge‚Äù LUL LUL LUL
[1:25:04] JesusGVG: again its not malicious because there is actually evidence supporting the charges LULW
[1:25:07] mad0monk: @Defonicx ahh, ok, I see, was wondering when this would be
[1:25:09] ZPanda_MS: I'm pretty sure he used your exact words there LUL
[1:25:11] orlandito03: malicious prosecution is bringing charges without probable cause
[1:25:12] TheTourist_: in the olden days someone would've just put a hit on cornwood instead
[1:25:15] buddha_hands: so what is the urgency he speaks of OMEGALAUGHING
[1:25:16] raikonduo: it look pretty rushed and could considered desperate. I can see a malice take
[1:25:17] c0rnishatheart: @JesusGVG exactly
[1:25:19] lookingfornothinghere: it sounded like you were trying to find any charge that sticks when in reality you just wanted him to give his unbiased opinion

[1:25:55] raikonduo: you said that to him, he just agreed tbh
[1:25:56] wavep987: *malicious prosecution, not malice

[1:25:57] rhaal_: Was the name "Slacks" intentional?
[1:25:58] shosher: He's trying to bank on the idea of you asking for finding any charges and pushing them immediately

[1:26:04] FeelsMelancholyMan: make crane fart
[1:26:05] itchybawls12: wtf is goin on
[1:26:05] Mickow94: I legit got the feeling that you actually tried to malicious prosecute Cornwood when this all happened and that you roleplayed it as you were just pressed by the other captains and was stressed etc
[1:26:06] LogicWeasel: xdd oops conflicted
[1:26:06] Count_Brennuvarg: @Ssaab Does Cornwood even have pending charges atm ICANT
[1:26:07] buddha_hands: "I DONT SPEAK FOR THEM" LMAOOOOO he's done quite a bit of speaking for them...

[2:26:44] LoneSoldier021: I didn't shot the suspect because I can't afford to reload lmao
[2:26:48] EpicOfGiggamesh: The OOC reason for the PD not getting funding is it needs to be a money sink and not contribute to inflation. As money is created dynamically, the server can't give it to PD as it reintroduces it into the market.
[2:26:51] jd2881: Does anyone know if the EMS are responsible for their own repairs? Or do they have state funding.
[2:26:51] reydedark: absolutely

[2:27:38] BBCapitalist: @EpicOfGiggamesh no the ooc reason is the devs havent set the system up yet and are working on it. a budget is coming
[2:27:38] saifallah___: @deezznutsxd fr i dont understand why the full 15% even goes to the officer and not to the PD smh its weird that a cop gets 15k for giving someone a 100k fine i feel like that gives initiative to push for unreasonable charges
[2:27:42] ryuudrg: 5k every week from every cop they keep the rest
[2:27:43] squelked: @robertsmithjr so are the other people grinding to work sani or whatever. officers have less opportunity to grind, but they can make their own equipment a prio

[2:28:45] PatrickMaybe: TARGET PRACTICE TOO!
[2:28:46] layla109: everyone needs gun licenses
[2:28:47] budogorilla: Pd could also run a lottery, make prize pools with confiscated goods and raffle them off
[2:28:50] EpicOfGiggamesh: Right now, they can't just hand money over. The state account is intended to be a money sink that keeps inflation in check. As per Nathan (crane) @bbcapitalist
[2:28:50] VYBZhfx: Great idea
[2:28:51] brvtyy: hunting trip is just an op to get rid of duncan
[2:28:54] KizzyTwitchTv: should do it during academy
[2:28:54] robertsmithjr: @squelked ok what about people who cant stay on more then 4 or 5 hours, it takes 4 hours of work to hopefully break even
[2:28:55] ryuudrg: what if pd do they own job EZ
[2:28:57] TheOGWombat: maybe the state sponsors the hunting license
[2:28:57] falcodark: include it as part of gun training for cadets
[2:28:58] Zevkk: @Alexqc19 Because there's nothing in the code to allow the state to allocate a budget from the state funds right now.
[2:28:58] MexiBrent: like 10 cops went off duty at once it was wild
[2:28:59] Alexqc19: OMEGALUL

[2:29:16] nivekalive: Wasn't there supposed to be a pizza party on Slacks house?
[2:29:16] riftshadow: I get what he saying... but PD  is a lot of work between meeting'sm time coimitment reports, court.. I think the Grime analogy that Crane made was not correct.
[2:29:16] Eruwawa: HAHAHA
[2:29:21] jersey_jesus: Buy it!

[2:29:51] tinywulf: who are these two? dont recognize them, 1st shift?
[2:29:51] xXxEV0xXx: @Ssaab Think the money people get from fines should go into the PD account instead of the persons account. Then the PD can use that account money to pay for everything they need. That way officers still get their salaries. And PD would get their PD money.
[2:29:53] Laggy_eu: PepeLaugh

[2:30:49] postAmongUsist: Hmmm almost like the captains had the pd's best interest and not the mayor and his pawns
[2:31:00] EpicOfGiggamesh: Yeah definitely, he also said they can't fork the profit from PD charges back to the PD directly for the same reason. However, the system that will roll out will factor inflation in. @bbcapitalist

[2:31:52] flugel_binder: what a shocker blame command LUL
[2:32:00] robertsmithjr: @squelked the difference is, if they have 4 hours in the city a day has to make a choice between being on patrol those 4 hours to maybe break even, or 4 hours making money some where else to fund other pd members car repairs for government owned vehicles what are they going to choose
[2:32:13] Defonicx: pspGlorp
[2:32:18] RobialT: @Kevz95 True, like having fewer officers is the solution

[2:33:27] Usahi_Light: @GustavoK___ It isn't a G6 truck or a news van. Part of the function of a cop car IS driving "recklessly" and being used as a battering ram
[2:33:38] Firasputinv: classic SPEEDRUN RP
[2:33:44] Navigator_Nav: @GustavoK___ in a chase you run the car into the red powerband. this damages the engine over time. This will make it so a car needs to be repaired quite often

[3:17:16] kieran347: if no daps are handed out then that is poor denzel got so many daps for far less lol
