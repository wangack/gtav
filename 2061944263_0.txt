[3:33:11] Bearcat_77: Their tiny microwave pizzas are easily the best.
[3:33:13] yaboigorn: red barons alright, but frozen pizza has its limits
[3:33:13] ValoDaemus: Red Baron is pretty solid and, minus a few "craft" brands, is pretty much the best frozen you can get.
[3:33:14] Silk_OG: red baron thin crust actually decent for frozen pizza i think

[3:35:19] rouemu: the officer tryed to tackle him off it looked like it was self defend
[3:35:20] Silk_OG: Their early pizzas were a little too experimental for my taste. But when Red Baron's Classic Pepperoni emerged, I believe they truly hit their stride, both in terms of flavor and market appeal. The entire pizza boasts a distinct, satisfying taste and a fresh layer of culinary expertise that elevates every slice. It's often likened to other brands, but I find Red Baron's distinct flavor profile carries a sharper, more satisfying edge.

[3:39:57] Silk_OG: In '87, Red Baron released its pinnacle creation: the Fore! pizza, marking its most accomplished offering yet. I believe its undisputed masterpiece is the "Supreme Sensation". A pizza so delectable, many may not fully appreciate its intricate flavors. Yet, they should, for it transcends mere culinary trends. It's a culinary anthem, a testament to Red Baron's dedication to excellence. Hey, CHAT!
[3:39:59] GlitterySharts: Every time I look to stream James is either incapacitated, holding people hostage, or dancing with a random object... I love it
[3:40:02] androssthealmighty: @HighlandRose101 his best defense is that it was Bobby Charles

[3:43:50] Silk_OG: Their early pizzas were a little too experimental for my taste. But when Red Baron's Classic Pepperoni emerged in '83, I think they really came into their own, both commercially and artistically. The whole pizza has a clear, crisp taste and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives it a big boost. It's often compared to other brands, but I find Red Baron's distinct flavor profile carries a sharper, more satisfying edge.
