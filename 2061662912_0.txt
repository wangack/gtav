[1:40:22] BadK: time to be garbage works

[1:48:38] Pabz951: but it seems like they built the server like that, you have to grind your ass of to make oney now
[1:48:43] xG3TxSHOTx: all these new streamers coming in from other games jumping straight into grinding because they aren't experienced with rping

[3:29:57] d4wson21: you repainted your house irl yet 😂
[3:29:58] 5nthony: Vinny is one of the most valuable assets to CG for just being clean alone people don’t see the long term
[3:30:02] poopy1028: I prefer vinny roleplay. When i want sbs i chose the boys
[3:30:03] lxxMcEpicxxl: I honestly prefer Vinny.. he bust his ass 100% of the time instead of scamming people.. I enjoy the honest RP
[3:30:04] katemilIer: @ThreeNPink I can ban in Ramee if you send to me

[3:30:25] gavinjames920: ez claps
[3:30:28] pink_sox99: I first started watching back when vinny owned pdm back in the day. That rp is what got me hooked. It was much different than the run and gun nature of gta
[3:30:28] markdaman80: @shotz  only time u went wild was echo RP  even and prodigy you were still slow burning I like I love the boys all the CG but the slow burn is the best
[3:30:28] Doowie: From what I can tell, the people who shit talk haven't really RP'ed on whitelisted servers. In gangs when I was part of MG13 on another server, we had at least 2 to 3 legal people who owned houses/business and to buy guns etc.

[3:31:29] Poor_Scum: coop was a great cop too

[6:17:38] VoodooA03: Also why does the fake government need fake taxes at like 25%
[6:17:38] Codered0603: Yall need to actually talk to people and not just each other, nothing is going to happen just keeping your opinions in house
[6:18:00] MrSlyth: No one to talk to and if you talk to them they dont listen
[6:18:16] ItsAHazardLife: sadly I knew being the cheapest wouldnt work but I'll agree mats/parts going above mosleys wouldnt be good either. It's been a lose lose
[6:18:21] 303beavis: The first people to bitch will be the people who ran the price up when a repair is 10k

[6:19:14] cannucky: somebody needs to give up their mechanics rep and become the new Sani king , start grabbing new residents at the apts and build a team of sani trucks . Maybe Joseph
[6:19:24] VVSKelevate: can dab get impeached?
[6:19:39] cannucky: Maybe Joseph he doesn't fix cars anymore
[6:19:49] arch_dawg: sounds like shops are going to have to compete on something other than price, because price ain’t going to vary that much
[6:19:53] jasonquinn2022: you need a sanitation team that’s Willing to put in the work
[6:20:05] MrSlyth: Wasnt Max suppose to help you guys if you voted for him, and yall helped him get elected. Seems like hes helping Mary and others more.
[6:21:17] auldae: a lot of broken promises, not many repercussions
[6:21:18] Codered0603: Tbh i feel like someone at City hall can give some more insight on stuff, I feel like you should vent your frustrations to somebody there
[6:21:34] arch_dawg: @mrslyth Dab seems overwhelmed with setting up a whole ass government. A lot of business stuff seems stuck behind development that is not top priority right now

[6:35:10] sarahmarbies: @a_harmless_kitten i thought its running because Mary has a good deal with Lang who controls sanitation
[6:35:32] Codered0603: Tbh devs have done jack shit recently, tons of crashing issues, constant changes to the economy, lack of oversight on problems of the server, etc.

[6:36:11] JOJOTHEPATRIOT: ah ok
[6:36:19] A_Harmless_Kitten: @sarahmarbies yeah but at this point prices are basically as high as rusty, and keep going up so at that point buying from rusty will be cheaper, and then there's no point for other stores.
[6:36:26] JOJOTHEPATRIOT: I know you can have cop cousins but wasn’t sure
[6:36:49] DocSteal: ads at the best RP momets \o/
[6:37:04] sarahmarbies: @a_harmless_kitten Lang’s rates to Mary are still cheaper than Rusty’s I think
[6:37:31] A_Harmless_Kitten: For now^ But also if they force move her out she can't get that deal so still good for them
[6:37:32] SkyGames024: @JOJOTHEPATRIOT ur characters dont know bout each other or interact with people the same way
[6:37:53] sarahmarbies: I think Vinny should’ve listened when Mary tried explaining her pricing scheme
[6:38:14] venom_fps: computer parts will degrade and need replacement so the price will still be high
