[2:17:48] IKEA_DOG: She makes so much fucking money most movies can't afford her apparently
[2:17:51] epic_smee: i think it's hard to fall off if you have the backing of the industry
[2:17:51] Mavmar: is that not a career already?
[2:18:05] painkillerz143: Like Robert Downy Jr
[2:18:05] yuzi_K0: Most off the cast will be down bad .Noah kid already fell off

[2:18:16] Jatnutt: oh its eleven
[2:18:20] mannevs: she seems so annoying
[2:18:24] PicklesDippedInRanch: I think someone will offer her a role for the same thing she did there, but in a much less hyped setting
[2:18:37] Zhachi1250: Had to google her, only seen her in the Enola Holmes movies and those things were dumb with the 4th wall breaking imo
[2:18:40] FiniteResources: a typecasted borderline mute actress LUL

[2:19:16] FideICastro_: Is she type casted? I don’t have any idea who she is
[2:19:17] Tomcream: She used to be
[2:19:21] jojaha: that kind of fame will change you without good mentors and mental at such a young age
[2:19:25] divandesalon: filling the vault instead of emptying it omg
[2:19:26] Tomcream: Apparently she admitted she doesn't believe it.
[2:19:30] santilloo88: She has a speciall way of acting, perfect for the freak roll in SF
