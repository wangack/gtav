[0:17:58] friendIykrueger: @nobodybodon you smell...
[0:18:11] friendIykrueger: like flowers flowerr
[0:18:31] nobodybodon: leavee
[0:18:32] jimothy64: Need to coordinate with the homeowners I guess...
[0:19:07] QuesoCommander: it shouldn't take a hit until the sani rep gets higher
[0:19:18] FattyMatty1996: It's weird because like... IRL bosses don't get mad that you work another job
[0:19:23] jimothy64: Yeah you're low enough it should be fine but that's a short term fix
[0:20:10] QuesoCommander: that's why the rep reduction should happen when you get close to a promotion at a another job
[0:20:18] Blunderbusses: i'm scared to death to try lumber which was the original idea for joshua before it scuffed on me the first time i tried it. my sani rep is too high.
[0:20:19] QuesoCommander: so you can be really good at one thing, but still bad at everything else
[0:20:25] jimothy64: Trouble is, that leads to all the specialists burning out and then nobody *can* rely on others
[0:20:29] vipersummer: it may settle or shift with time, people may realize... oh hitting sany screws us too?
[0:20:35] vipersummer: or it will just continue as it is
[0:20:45] tasteliketaro: the solution could be to "lock" the rep in and make it so you dont gain rep with other jobs
[0:20:53] StreamElements: Feel free to join my Discord flock, 5000 members and growing! https://discordapp.com/invite/nakkida
[0:21:13] tfw_badfeel: weird how there's no doors for the porch/terrace
[0:21:13] JackDaily: :)
[0:21:22] nobodybodon: would be nice if there was some obvious groupings of jobs. so you could run "material jobs" without tanking rep in other material jobs
[0:21:56] jimothy64: Honestly just set a minimum. If you do an hour of lumber you don't gain rep or lose rep with others. Go over that then things start to tick etc.
[0:22:13] molotov_michelle: Yeah
[0:22:19] nobodybodon: I don't THINK every job lowers every other rep, but theres no obvious indication of that will lower what

[0:23:09] Darth_hedgehog: MYAAA
[0:23:14] Darth_hedgehog: love me
[0:23:46] jimothy64: Because now we're reaching a point where the people who've been doing certain jobs exclusively are burning out, so the supplies are drying up and nobody wants to fill the void because they'll lose everything they've worked for.. its a city wide sunk-cost issue compounding everything else
[0:24:20] QuesoCommander: nakkiOMEGA

[0:25:17] QuesoCommander: not a bad time to mess with rooms since there's nothing to lose
[0:25:32] jimothy64: Okay hear me out... would rooms help?
[0:26:00] Chiracho: oh god... not the rooms KEKW
[0:26:08] Chiracho: not after last time
[0:26:19] nobodybodon: they have no server racks!

[0:27:13] JoeayIV: actually
[0:27:17] JoeayIV: i don't think rooms would help
[0:27:20] vipersummer: that was sarcasm!
[0:27:27] JoeayIV: thats the ceiling to the entrance
[0:27:39] JoeayIV: so there isn't a point
[0:27:41] jimothy64: I have no clue if it'll actually help, it's basically a loading trigger issue, idk what rooms might help that
[0:28:05] JoeayIV: you might just need smaller floors for that part
[0:28:06] QuesoCommander: only what is visible when you walk in would need to laod
[0:28:12] QuesoCommander: but that would be that floor
[0:28:29] jimothy64: I'm just wondering if it's possible to essentially trick the loading area to actually be inside, rather than outside

[0:35:29] FattyMatty1996: do we have any plans for the day?

[0:39:48] JoeayIV: i mean
[0:39:52] JoeayIV: it is on an angle
[0:39:57] vipersummer: why did that tag you sorry

[0:58:45] JoeayIV: friend?
[0:58:52] QuesoCommander: 32 + 1 for the board
[0:58:54] JoeayIV: you probably could
[0:59:00] tfw_badfeel: bar chairs next to the kitchen table would look super cool
