[5:15:39] kevlarshields: ome5 ott gonna pay the fine
[5:15:47] slowixe: yea
[5:15:49] FrostFox_99: @psyduckmd only during active situations (like shootouts)
[5:15:49] DarkLight917: @Zoun19 Lang isnt even really undercutting the company. He has made like 4 total sales... he just twatted out to stir when the company did something he didnt like.
[5:15:50] crownberriess: KEKW
[5:15:54] actuallyv1le: @zeepimp if u call scuff benjis fault lmao
[5:15:59] MaNi_108_: We have perez MEGALUL no need to fear
[5:16:00] Zoun19: well, if you camp Buddha, it will make it tougher for him to move around. He may want to seek a meeting
[5:16:04] sunngoddnikka: People are already blaming Ray🥲
[5:16:04] Skillah10s: Sandy is shit
[5:16:04] dkakr: there's no market left bro.. everyone got a pc now lol
[5:16:05] hasanoo5: they are not gonna stop
[5:16:07] tuvix2: There is no defined market anymore
[5:16:08] psyduckmd: Because if there are too many groups involved its a shit show for RP sense
[5:16:10] classified619: the whole point is lang is pushing them out their turf after saying they would share
[5:16:13] KingDeez0: LUL
[5:16:15] Nywro: Undercutting gouging. LUL
[5:16:15] slowixe: convo
[5:16:16] djerbis: Benji dosent need a bank account to make money from weed LUL LUL LUL SeemsGood
[5:16:19] Zoun19: @DarkLight917 didn't The Company go to war because of Buddha cutting them?
[5:16:21] alanayana: why would they stop that, when before they didnt stop
[5:16:21] LordMunkeren: Remember Jason Polam is undercutting the market aswell
[5:16:22] hotpotatohurricane: JP won't let go of Cyprus
[5:16:22] carahwheel: !respect
[5:16:23] mrnewtonx: Basically they won LUL
[5:16:23] j1nroo: but the market is already ruined
[5:16:25] dstopian: ott using too much logic
[5:16:26] sticketss: raycEat raycEat
[5:16:27] rchouse: @tuvix2 that's so tru it's been shoved to the ground  at this point
[5:16:27] ChipSkylarksShinyToof: the market is dead
[5:16:28] dkakr: your market is purely butc now
[5:16:30] clownnaround90: JPs gota go
[5:16:30] HoronXI: technically the market is already fucked up due to all teh players. no longer the company and lang's.
[5:16:35] veviico: the market is ruined
[5:16:35] classified619: thats not going to happen
[5:16:36] Luzifff: imo, JP need to change his mindset. He has the mindset of a lonewolf. He needs to take care of his people.  He is a leader now. Act like a leader. Anyhow it goes it is awesome RP
[5:16:39] CyanMig: jp is gonna want concessions and lang is gonna be stubborn like he always is
[5:16:40] radardyingscene: meanwhile JAYSON POLAM getting sales
[5:16:40] dezalbos: elbyADHD JP elbyADHD  󠀀
[5:16:41] ginger_james91: I feel like jp's war rp just forces the city to stop their rp and just feed the warlords rp
[5:16:42] pikykz: Reach out on your own man
[5:16:43] veviico: by others not just union
[5:16:43] carahwheel: !backseat
[5:16:43] RaycBot: backseat gaming gets annoying and may result to accidental !meta. This includes telling Ray how to RP and what to do next. Excessive backseat gaming may result in a timeout or ban without warning. So chill and enjoy the show. Thank you. STFU
[5:16:45] Sh4rkill3r: they dont gonna accept that. he never talk with lang? wtf
[5:16:48] crownberriess: @zoun19 camp Lang, he just gonna call the cops LUL classic
[5:16:49] rnyds: Thats not going to happen, its JP
[5:16:50] andresperez26: The issue is only Lang knows how to control JP and they are getting far from talking. Also but Lang and JP are very ego manics and neither will back down first
[5:16:56] Garfill: why Jp dont wanna reach out again..
[5:17:00] FightmasterZA: You have 4 people fighting 2 diff groups.
[5:17:00] hekisan: JP
[5:17:02] swordinfinity: @mrnewtonx they always won. they still make money in this war while company not.
[5:17:03] TropicalToucan: Lang achieved his goals of his strain is dominant and the market is destroyed
[5:17:03] dank9686: Lang got a new big buyer.  He won’t want to do any business with The Company
[5:17:03] Mr_Feyshade: Going to war with everyone makes enemies consider becoming allies. That will hurt you in the end.
[5:17:06] pikykz: Jp said it can't come from him so maybe either u or OTT handle it
[5:17:06] lewisborlase: "Something something all our opinions matter something something"
[5:17:09] HoronXI: @Garfill its a mind game LUL
[5:17:11] foureyes_tv: Chatting
[5:17:12] azizi64: lang and jp both so stubborn tough to get them to calm down
[5:17:17] BOOOMIC: @Mr_Feyshade FirstTimeDentger
[5:17:20] cbjester: JP's right that whoever reaches out first will be perceived as the loser by the other side.
[5:17:23] cjonski: Jp is the main character he doesn't surrender
[5:17:25] CygnusX406: essaying
[5:17:28] adem17tito: Just have a meeting right now and talk about it
[5:17:31] Niccson98: Chat is to invested. Chill and what’s the rp

[5:17:36] FeelsgachiBASSMan: Chatting i believe that Chatting this should happen this way Chatting because in my personal opinion Chatting i believe Chatting that im right Chatting
[5:17:36] Raionx21: kind of crazy to think this is going to end with lang selling  materials to the company again
[5:17:43] h0yMinoy: its right back there
[5:17:52] Zoun19: going after the Sanitation Union is useless. Going after the boss (buddha, harry etc) is the win condition
[5:17:53] PortalHaze: with so many people having racks and benches. I don’t see the market as being salvageable
[5:17:53] dmurray01_: go straight
[5:17:54] DarkLight917: @Zoun19 in character they think he did, but he actually didnt, Yuno did like 3 sales to his family, and that combined with the stirring twats is why they think that.
[5:17:54] HoronXI: @Raionx21 if that happen i would literally die of laughter
[5:18:00] classified619: lang don't care and will always go after the company no matter what the company is doing
[5:18:03] mrnewtonx: @mrnewtonx company is also making money if they decide to sell butc 300 a pop
[5:18:08] psyduckmd: LUL
[5:18:12] azizi64: it won’t @raionx21 lang and co want ties cut completely
[5:18:15] Naksha1123: why was ray late today? i waited 10hours for the stream to start xqcDespair
[5:18:16] ezekiel_093: all of them are right its just unfortunate that other parties want to join the war so bad
[5:18:18] blackcattheotaku: Ngl I'm invested. Cos it's good rp I'll give me 2 cents about stuff but try not to be toxic. It's still Just a game after all.
[5:18:23] bluewind5v: hheh Lang never sold any rack at 10K, he troll twattet and Yuno sold several Blueprints at 15k..
[5:18:26] dezalbos: omE 0.4
[5:18:27] CyanMig: stopping people doing sani will actually drive up material prices, and lang is losing NO sleep over clapped garbage guys

[5:19:16] kurairell: I think the company is actually the underdog here to be honest
[5:19:17] TeamRMDY: New irl semi for citys
[5:19:29] ChipSkylarksShinyToof: multiple useless people
[5:19:33] Nywro: Materials are a long game, any new hot item is just a short fade that can only be pumped so long.
[5:19:38] TeamRMDY: Makes moving loads in small areas way easier
[5:19:42] cbjester: If you think you're losing the war, it'd make sense to approach Lang about ending it.
[5:19:49] KushKowboy6: @nosidebackwards the first I think. he’s coming back to a shit storm
[5:19:50] StreamElements: Ray has an active Twitter that you can use to stay up to date with him! raycHypeTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheRay_C

[5:20:28] pikykz: Think about it with Patar, Patar decided it wasn't smart for him so he made the phone call and ended it. Now Buddha doesn't put no mind to Patar
[5:20:28] beean1985: that ain’t going to work

[10:58:11] juliaweismann: @zulu189 yes and no. You can see the warrants but you can't see whose warrant it is. but cops usually put the name of the person in the title, so sometimes you can see who the warrant is for and you can also see when it will expire.
