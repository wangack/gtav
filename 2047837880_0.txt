[2:34:30] Graudenzo: !size
[2:34:30] doggensteinn: tbh the other PD messed up and slacks took the blame
[2:34:31] RetPaladinBot: After getting these numbers we find find the average flaccid penis size ( 3.61 ) and divide the average erect penis size (5.16) and do the following: 5.16/3.61 to get the soft to erect ratio. 5.16/3.61=1.42 inches erect for every inch soft. So we take esfands soft/slight chub size of 5.71 and multiply it by 1.42 to find his erect size. 5.71*1.42= 8.1

So we take esfands soft/slight chub size of 5.71 and multiply it by 1.42 to find his erect size. 5.71*1.42= 8.1

[2:53:07] mcbain110: Do it
[2:53:08] kain_loc: Fascism!
[2:53:08] BigGriller: Yeah it implies knowledge of a crime
[2:53:12] ToyLetTreat: it wont get changed till someone points it out

[2:53:41] HavocusRex: it's comparable to flashing your lights to warn that a cop is down the road with radar, it is freedom of speech to do so, same thing with saying you don't want to talk to cops

[2:53:57] EclecticMotives: YEs
[2:53:57] SavageTarzan: IFISPEAK find out in RP

[2:53:59] BerzerkHitzDiff: your not wrong
[2:53:59] pie_1112: not wrong

[2:54:00] cookiez_n_corndogz: maybe shrujj
[2:54:00] Wetidiot: what if they just dont like the cops, and dont know anything and say that
[2:54:00] YEP46: YEP u r right
[2:54:01] ergofoe: Listen
[2:54:01] cowill93: not wrong, not right

[2:54:02] blahder: Flops just did
[2:54:02] BoldSlowbro: i think you are right
[2:54:02] andrlies: Hindering requires action
[2:54:02] mattchutt: @baur yes
[2:54:02] TraviiiOnTwitch: right against self incrimination

[2:54:05] cailtis: yoo
[2:54:05] HazyHung: you can’t use them remaining silent as proof of a crime @esfandtv
[2:54:06] Freddiepines: yo
[2:54:06] Pibon1: yo KEKW
[2:54:06] Rockshock: Miranda rights is about whaty they can be used against them in a court. Not about putting a charge on them
[2:54:07] LumberChopMan: "I dont talk to cops" doesnt mean "I know something im not telling you"
[2:54:07] Cult_personality: not snitching is their right
[2:54:07] typicaluser777: I think I get your point I like the idea it makes sense
[2:54:08] Paudelly: @EsfandTV They dont have the requirement to assist with your investigation
[2:54:08] disruptedorder: Just cause they said they don't snitch doesn't mean they know what happened @esfandtv
[2:54:08] lolJazzyJoker: he just explained as uwere talking to chat
[2:54:08] Dragonrs: yo
[2:54:08] CreepeAir: yo
[2:54:08] Rixxey: that IS obstruction
[2:54:09] dains84: irl wrong, in game you are right
[2:54:09] willietrom: would you be right if they said "I remain silent for cops"?
[2:54:09] Gh0stdh: saying you arent a snitch isnt necessarily an admission of guilt
[2:54:09] Kasvar: yoo
[2:54:10] rhansi: yo KappaCool
[2:54:11] zeldaspirit: if they textually said I’m not a snitch
[2:54:11] seal_clubber39: yes LMAO, its a right as a citizen
[2:54:12] MackPlays: Ask Andrews
[2:54:12] Utschig: KKona Yo brother
[2:54:12] ZilzGaming: they had the right to remain silent they chose not too
[2:54:13] BigGriller: With your RP legislation you right probably
[2:54:14] Ross_McD: ask a judge
[2:54:14] WellEndowedGerbil: you're not wrong, but theres no way in hell youre gonna be able to prove that in court
[2:54:14] CptTimberwolf: You sound correct however they could argue that they would say that regardless of knowledge of any incidence
[2:54:14] andrlies: Hindering requires action, words dont matter
[2:54:14] Me4onyX: Sounds logically for sure
[2:54:15] CraigsWorldHD: But how are you gonna prove what information they are withholding under the law the become an accomplave
[2:54:15] BerzerkHitzDiff: the words say exactly what your articulating
[2:54:15] SkyeReaper: right to remain silent is about self-incrimination
[2:54:15] alienx420x: SHOULDNT A JUDGE JOIN THESE CONVOS?
[2:54:16] Khaosshinobi: i think he's halfway wrong NODDERS
[2:54:16] Cult_personality: can not be used  against them
[2:54:17] zac4e: All about PC
[2:54:17] robbyreyn10: grey areas of the law but you make a good argument
[2:54:18] chriswithguns: good enough
[2:54:19] L0wkeyDrew: ur wrong because why are you mirandas the victim?
[2:54:19] Aynese: saying youre not a snitch doesn't imply they know what happens per se, you are taking it as they do know
[2:54:19] CptTimberwolf: There Slacks is right
[2:54:19] Jrey000: Especially in this game LULW there are so many people that want to talk because they are not a snitch LULW
[2:54:20] areolagrande__: Maybe in general not 100% cases
[2:54:21] SavageTarzan: Classic
[2:54:22] Kev_Prime: I love you but I feel like your wrong unless you know they were a witness maybe they lie to you or hide evidence then it feels like a felony
[2:54:23] Spliphos1199: exactly they have to be there
[2:54:24] BauR: @mattchutt Pog thanks
[2:54:24] DazedenConfused: I just listened to the Cornwood Act earlier
[2:54:25] hollowrust: you're wrong. the impetus is on the government
[2:54:25] Thebreadlord: bingo
[2:54:25] edmondhondaesquire: someone might not have a clue what is going on but they just dont want to be seen even interacting with the police for "street cred" reasons
[2:54:25] HavocusRex: Freedom of speech is why, they can say what they want
[2:54:25] Grumplestillskin: Not talking to you AND not having knowledge of the crime
[2:54:27] PAJAMA_MONSTER: "I am not a snitch" doesn't imply they have information which is relevant and are refusing to give it
[2:54:27] TheDaghda: 5th is for self incrimination not snitching
[2:54:28] EclecticMotives: in the real world people dont talk LUL its the reason why alot of crimes in the hood never get dealt with
[2:54:28] davideil: Using the word snitch is the iffy part
[2:54:28] vitilink: they have the freedom of speech of saying they are not snitching, it doesnt mean that they actually know something
[2:54:29] energizergeyser: exactly that was the piece that was missing
[2:54:31] Brave_Silver: I do not know enough to answer
[2:54:31] Trama66: it’s too OP @esfandtv
[2:54:31] VBW410: this is gonna be abused and changed in a months time
[2:54:32] WhereTisWaldo: the snitch part is what’s obstruction happens because snitching implies they know the information
[2:54:33] ekkoscrub: ur not wrong but its broadline rp but could be under harboring a fugitive if you want to charge them in a friendly rp way ig @EsfandTV
[2:54:34] CraigsWorldHD: Under the law they become an accomplice if proven to lie
[2:54:34] jazeblazin: It's your job to investigate incidents there is no requirement for anyone to help you with your investigation by answering questions
[2:54:34] jmoriarty013: what a paradox
[2:54:38] mtgswt: "i don't snitch" is just lingo, they are not required to speak under any circumstances
[2:54:39] the_fayth: You are wrong because "Server Health"
[2:54:41] smalllittleisaac: ?
[2:54:42] itsJER: normans are not here to make you able to arrest them
[2:54:42] Ciefon: chat, precedence from the US legal system doesn't apply in the fictional state of Los Santos
[2:54:43] L0wkeyDrew: theydont have to because they didnt commit a crime
[2:54:43] muricapewpew: they can plead the fifth
[2:54:44] mercs99: you would have to prove they had knowledge about the scene
[2:54:45] ruperttheyeti: xdd
[2:54:47] tommythetiger28: 500iq
[2:54:48] tanksly: I don't think youre wrong if they say they dont snitch, because it implies they do know
[2:54:49] MattadinGaming: obstruction is an act

[2:54:51] TMakBC: let the court decide
[2:54:55] Bundooa: mhm
[2:54:56] ethameta: think of it as the right to not self incriminate
[2:54:57] Thebreadlord: I “think” legally you are correct.  But I’m not a lawyer
[2:55:00] BoogieAnimal: Idk
[2:55:00] zac4e: Its good to take stuff like this up atleast
[2:55:01] TheGhostlyOnyx: @mtgswt no but then they complain the cops aren't doing anything
[2:55:02] Kelborn: Eyewitnesses have no duty to talk to the police
[2:55:02] mensrea123: YEP exactly
[2:55:02] LogicWeasel: MhmSpicy
[2:55:04] Jrey000: @tanksly you are right LULW
[2:55:04] phaden_: "I don't recall"
[2:55:05] LogicWeasel: MhmSpicy  󠀀
[2:55:06] Clodhoppr: 1000%
[2:55:07] sturg2k5: just cos they say you don’t talk to police doesn’t mean you know what happened
[2:55:08] ThereIsOnlyWar: The 5th amendment in the US allows you to say things like "I don't talk to cops", but Lost Santos does not have the same laws and protections as the US constitution.
[2:55:08] CptTimberwolf: Let him cook chat
[2:55:08] LogicWeasel: !vanish
[2:55:08] blabla1a: i dont snitch means they know something but wont say
[2:55:10] Martialcamero7: PD needs to talk to DOJ to get exact definitions
[2:55:11] BoldSlowbro: play hardball back
[2:55:11] NonToxicant: what you just said makes sense I think
[2:55:12] typicaluser777: IT MAKES SENSE
[2:55:12] itsJER: op
[2:55:12] wavy__________________: treat them as hostile and shoot them
[2:55:13] JakeStratic: Yea, i'm not talking to the police = I don't snitch. That is fair. but "i'm not going to tell you" suggests they know, until they say they don't know.
[2:55:13] GLSMarbles: A witness can plead the fith tho
[2:55:15] BoldSlowbro: i agree
[2:55:17] KYslippy: think all you can do is get their ID and attach them to the scene
[2:55:18] un_heilig: cops too scared of daps KEKW
[2:55:21] MisterBrojangles: a lot of the shit Crim do is too OP.
[2:55:23] wafiy637: true
[2:55:23] Hustler__John: there should be a judge at these meetings once n a while
[2:55:23] jdotno: in court they are required to answer but not forced speech by a cop
[2:55:24] chriswithguns: it's not OP. It's super easy to just not say  I don't snitch"
[2:55:24] Felaryn: If they don't want to get involved just be quiet LUL
[2:55:24] kyleeeeeee_: ppl who say op are crim viewers LULE
[2:55:25] Jrey000: in Snr buns is so bad LULW
[2:55:26] tolmangamgee: @EsfandTV because U.S. Code protects "Free Speech" ( 1st amm. the right to express how much you hate police), while also protecting 5th amm. (the right not to incriminate yourself)
[2:55:26] PokeMom019: It is getting bad
[2:55:30] TheDaghda: 5th is only for yourself
[2:55:30] ZilzGaming: if teh laws get written poorly teh cops can abuse it
[2:55:31] BoogieAnimal: @EsfandTV what would you say to I dont recall?
[2:55:32] jpadilla999: Who has the clip of Cornwood gone for 24 hours and all the crime happening?
[2:55:32] chriswithguns: it's not OP. It's super easy to just not say  "I don't snitch"
[2:55:33] Lite_Ice: its not op if crims could do something like that they would
[2:55:35] god_awful_gamer: There are witness to crimes laws in the US and you can get obstruction
[2:55:35] WildWolfX: What if they feel at risk for snitching?
[2:55:36] hollowrust: im lookin forward to cornwood just shooting mofos the next few hours
[2:55:36] BulletProofSwede: I agree
[2:55:36] shadow__rain: mess around and find out - Cornwood
[2:55:38] phaden_: "I don't recall."
[2:55:39] Ruttiger64: a witness can only plead the fifth if it involves them though, not just in general
[2:55:40] chaosproductions: try it and let the judge sort it out
[2:55:40] bryanharris01: saying you dont talk to the police is pleading the fifth
[2:55:40] Shmoopee: not a witness
[2:55:41] ComradeGreetingCard: they are so scared of testing the law
[2:55:41] jay2seam: these laws are public for a reason
[2:55:41] TraviiiOnTwitch: 5TH IS AGAINST SELF INCRIMINATION NOT SPEAKING
[2:55:41] VBW410: but like southsiders for example there rping “gangsters” which normally means fuck the cops 0 corporation
[2:55:42] suoicil: right to remain silent and not self incriminate.  Read the 5th ammendment
[2:55:43] un_heilig: might as well cancle the whole PD f it
[2:55:43] ultrachauuud: I think you should try it and let the courts figure it out
[2:55:43] junglekarp: use cloud gaze emote @EsfandTV
[2:55:44] Sibroticus: Just need Wrangler around to back you up
[2:55:44] Scrando: I think you’re right
[2:55:44] LogicWeasel: that's not OP, they just told the cop they're witholding info
[2:55:45] Endjoi: its not op, if you dont want to snitch just dont say anything
[2:55:46] s5ashadow01: thatt's literally something that could easily be argued in court IRL. if the model of the court system is based of US IRL Law, Cronwood's argument is 1000% valid
[2:55:46] warner05: You and Rhodes are actually in the right here IMO
[2:55:47] BoogieAnimal: kk
[2:55:47] GLSMarbles: That cop is saying witnesses can't plead the fifth
[2:55:50] L0wkeyDrew: you cant do it do a pubic witness
[2:55:53] CatBot1_: crims just have to be smart in what they say
[2:55:53] YEP46: mhm
[2:55:53] CraigsWorldHD: You cant arrest someone for saying iam not a snitch
[2:55:54] Rixxey: "i saw it but i wont tell you" is obstruction imo
[2:55:55] Graudenzo: you can only plead the the to protect yourself, not others. which would make it obstruction @EsfandTV
[2:55:55] vizzyvee005: are you arguing what they are -not- saying?
[2:55:55] ssdccb: The first amendment would still cover that situation of refusing to snitch
[2:55:56] andrlies: Hindering requiores action, not answering isnt hindering.
[2:55:56] ELesEff: where is WideEsfando
[2:55:56] irtrol: OKEY rhodes is on board
[2:55:57] Crosstak: Don't stop at obstruction, tack on accessory after the fact @esfandtv
[2:55:57] rob_aye: you got it right imo
[2:56:01] TenderPantyz: LULW
[2:56:03] un_heilig: LUL
[2:56:04] Ruttiger64: And they can ask questions off the record that they are required to answer too
[2:56:04] warner05: LUL

[2:56:05] ruperttheyeti: You're right but I doubt there could be a way to prove their knowledge and charge them for remaining silent

[2:56:21] DrWetbone: ironically if they are a witness that gets felony obstruction they then become a defendant who doesn’t have to speak

[2:56:32] complexlalo: 1st amendment right
[2:56:38] Ciefon: there is no fifth amendment in this game chat, they have to enact a law that provides those rights
[2:56:46] Aphotice: saying "i dont snitch" in that situation is basically admitting you know what happened and wont tell
[2:56:47] Khaosshinobi: what about when cops get a criminal to legally admit they did something when they had their rights read, but now suddenly "it's hearsay" if they say it in the cells, for example
[2:56:47] lzrdwzrdtv: esfandRage_BW
[2:56:48] ZilzGaming: every court case i've seen in 4.0 says the 5th isnt in los santos

[2:56:52] rhino608: all the higher crims will figure out that loophole in 3 seconds and you’ll just get I don’t recall
[2:56:52] jdotno: if you are able to force someone to speak, what is the difference between that and forcing three to say exactly what you want them to sau
[2:56:54] JakeStratic: @phaden_ That works but technically saying you don't recall when you do recall is felony obstruction. The trick is proving they have reason to know something. If they admit they're there - it is reasonable they have some information. They can still plead stupidity but not "I WONT TELL YOU"
[2:56:56] izahkiel: esfandCozy
[2:56:59] L0wkeyDrew: @EsfandTV you cant force a public witness to speak because they didnt commit no crime and are not under arrest
[2:57:03] hollowrust: fuck turner too good
[2:57:05] Zerrada_: i mean techinically, if you read them their rights and and say " i don't snitch" they are choosing to not to remain silent and practically admitting to guilt because why else would they have to say "they don't snitch"
[2:57:05] un_heilig: this guy sounds like hes standing in a hallway
[2:57:07] RedLine__05: I could have said i shot this guy because i'm a crazy dumbass
[2:57:08] skitrun: @EsfandTV what if someone said i have a bomb
[2:57:10] zac4e: They would have to say "I witnessed what happened, but I aint snitching" for it to be obstruction right?

[2:58:37] Khaosshinobi: that is correct
[2:58:37] tochkataa: they are covering for a crime
[2:58:37] ThereIsOnlyWar: @ThereIsOnlyWar Chat is arguing because a lot of them don't know. The arguement in RP is likely happening by design because the DoJ and the Constitution in RP was set up in a way to promote NEW caselaw/precedence to emerge from what happens IN CHARACTER at in-game trials.
[2:58:38] Sarcon: If they acknowledge that they have information and won't relinquish that information then I would agree that they can be charged.
[2:58:38] LogicWeasel: they became an accomplice
[2:58:38] Ashtamnir: Might be accomplice now

[2:58:51] TheGhostlyOnyx: Mmmm I feel like that would go against freedom of speech

[2:59:21] blahder: There is a difference between forcing them and arresting them
[2:59:22] Whistlebeak: you can't force em but you can still punish them for the crime

[2:59:32] LogicWeasel: Hmm  Y
[2:59:32] JakeStratic: You can't force them to speak but you can charge them for obstruction if they establish they were present and witnessed it and refuse to tell you @EsfandTV ... They can state they were scared and only saw the ground but not I won't tell you.
[2:59:41] CptTimberwolf: You wouldn't be forcing them, you would be charging them for non compliance assuming you can prove or otherwise articulate they know more
[2:59:41] TheGhostlyOnyx: he could pled the 5th
[2:59:44] EvilCoatrack: cops don't have a right to trial, the accused does

[3:04:07] Brisk_Avocado: @bytex678 mostly same rules apply tho
[3:04:14] KYslippy: take their statement even if it was nothing. then in court you have to prove their testimony wrong or they were on scene when saying I don't recall. then it can be purgory or obstuction
[3:04:14] JakeStratic: @sneaky_alex IRL often police officers don't charge obstruction if reasonable fear is present of witnesses but they still use obstruction to attempt to compel a testimony and if they think they're gang members they may even charge. The case law here (noPixel) is the charge itself.
[3:04:16] RaunchyOLDwoman: Right, like if someone on scene says anything that gives the officer RS they can be arrested
[3:04:17] Sammah0: police arrest people for wrong reasons all the time, the question is if the DA pressed the charges
[3:04:18] Diminim: pedal bikes for cadets!
[3:04:20] sub084: @EsfandTV just ask Andrews

[3:04:54] LogicWeasel: Clap
[3:04:54] XvG_Yellow_Flash: I see police as being brutal in dealing with this, take no sht attitude always, but the RP is so soft compared to it ngl, someone gives a cop lip irl and they get face planted to the good with cuffs

[3:05:31] ZilzGaming: @Bluntblower_508 wait do you mean in game years for rp training cuz teh cadets get far more and 36 minutes of training
[3:05:33] hollowrust: 3 hrs in today and Cornwood has not discharged weapon.
[3:05:34] CommanderMatte: hoild up how did pd have their guns stolen?
[3:05:34] willietrom: @driver1036 I think they're saying other officers and even the same officer if they re-arm and find them later

[3:14:50] ClausFC92: Is Archer still being sus? Susge
[3:14:50] Toastedgamer03: he could put on a hat and get fired
[3:14:51] raven1022: I'll only be on for a bit tonight :copium
[3:14:53] SkyeReaper: that video of mr k and ramee reaming slacks is actually cathartic looking back on it
[3:14:53] taraannee: @lucidifous yup! he was chasing clowns b4 and said over radio he didnt have his tazer & slacks radio'd "thats 1 dap"
[3:14:55] Kelborn: @Bluntblower_508 not really lol, its causing people to second guess themselves in life or death situations and lead to people just doing nothing when they need to take action
[3:14:56] iJerrBear: sgtaAH sgtaAH sgtaAH sgtaAH sgtaAH sgtaAH
[3:14:57] hollowrust: his previous daps expire soon though right?
[3:15:00] claptil: Sadge
[3:15:00] hollowrust: like 1 week?:
[3:15:01] judge_hat: the last time he spoke, he wanted to change shifts
[3:15:07] PsychoJoker: Sadge
[3:15:07] TheSlike123: @kasded i know unfortunantly i love seeing euegene in traffic stops cause he talks himself out of 80-90% of the stops vade3 vade2 vade1
[3:15:08] JC9R_: AND it doesnt have to go up to other captains since its only 1 dap
[3:15:11] TheLadyCupcake: has aziz recovered from his penis enlargement surgery completely?
[3:15:15] CLERICssbu: this is just a chain of command actually implemented in a video game and enforced fr fr and it’s causing tension because it’s not fun
[3:15:17] Toastedgamer03: @hollowrust no daps take 60 days to go away
[3:15:27] CLERICssbu: majinShrug
[3:15:28] Shmoopee: Good stream esfandL esfandL esfandL
[3:15:29] ebos22: Chat not trying to troll but since the whole incident has DeRolo even been on shift... haven't seen her?
[3:15:34] tanglex2: play the video for him
[3:15:38] smpies: its should be 2 week tbh
[3:15:40] Pastel_Spell: @ebos22 she was on earlier
[3:15:41] dibadibb: @TheLadyCupcake you got it wrong, he had a penis reduction surgery cos it was way too big
[3:15:50] 13nox__: cornwoods daps go away in like a week?
[3:15:59] leemuh_: @Toastedgamer03 so what exactly are daps what do they do?
[3:16:05] Kev_Prime: daps last 60 irl days
[3:16:05] devvyloud: hello sir
[3:16:11] TheLadyCupcake: ABOBA you're fired
[3:16:12] devvyloud: esfandL esfandL
[3:16:13] DaltonCL: @dibadibb Sadly the surgery was a failure SAJ
[3:16:13] RoloDage: @Toastedgamer03 decisive action points
[3:16:20] hollowrust: DISCIPLINARY
[3:16:22] ZilzGaming: @Toastedgamer03 at 10 they lose their job
[3:16:26] Toastedgamer03: @leemuh_ disciplinary action points, you go against sops and get 10 of them you fired
[3:16:26] hollowrust: no
[3:16:28] CLERICssbu: disciplinary action points
[3:16:30] hollowrust: they are under review
[3:16:38] JakeStratic: @dibadibb lol
[3:16:43] CLERICssbu: who decides who gets a cap
[3:16:45] CLERICssbu: dap*
[3:16:47] Bundooa: mhm it's time to ask the one of the tiktok lawyers about your witness thing
[3:16:48] 13nox__: @ZilzGaming they dont lose their job its a review with the captains
[3:16:49] Rockshock: They get suspended with a high command review
[3:16:51] Switchblade142: @ZilzGaming Technically at 10 it goes to a review, firing is probably unlikely initially
[3:16:57] blahder: I have him 2x assault
[3:16:58] TheSlike123: I dont get why nopixel public has a fully fledged pd while the whitelisted one is still a "skeleton crew"
[3:17:01] Gh0stPog: @CLERICssbu caps
[3:17:01] blahder: 1x robbery
[3:17:01] Toastedgamer03: @hollowrust well if you wanna get real technical it is a indefinite suspension but that is basically being fired
[3:17:02] CLERICssbu: is it one person, is it out to a vote
[3:17:07] leemuh_: @Toastedgamer03 ah i see
[3:17:08] johnnycolision: dap = Denzel ain’t policing KEKW
[3:17:15] Bluntblower_508: @kelborn lets agree to disagree? I think its better this way. They all need this. To figure out how to properly handle all situations. Instead of going in guns blazing every single time.
[3:17:16] CDowg1: Pog My Birth Year
[3:17:22] CLERICssbu: is there more than one captain?
[3:17:28] romoleus: @dibadibb You got it wrong his BALLS are severely enlarged and make a clinking noise when examined.
[3:17:29] iCarDog: Dap = deep anal penetration
[3:17:31] hollowrust: Toastedgamer03 yes a dap is technical so lets be technical with this too right?"
[3:17:35] Bluntblower_508: All they have to do is keep trying
[3:17:36] Khaosshinobi: @iCarDog gachiW
[3:17:37] Orbilion: HUH
[3:17:40] blahder: You left the 2x assault on though
[3:17:40] TheGhostlyOnyx: @iCarDog HUH
[3:17:44] sendemup: lookUp wat
[3:17:48] omn___i: esfandBald
[3:17:48] ViciousRumor: @CLERICssbu 3 captains at the moment, Turner, Slacks, and Ruth
[3:17:50] JakeStratic: @13nox__ Honestly, from what i've heard. I'm not sure high command even exists and most people are just saying it is a firing. High command review was 3.0 but not sure.
[3:17:50] zac4e: Its Processed no?
[3:17:58] Shmoopee: predictions. ! DinkDonk does he end or stay on
[3:17:59] KYslippy: @TheSlike123 how many DAPs in the public PD LUL
[3:18:07] CLERICssbu: @viciousrumor and they need to come to a 2/3 majority to hand out a dap?
[3:18:08] Bluntblower_508: @icardog hawt
[3:18:11] TheGhostlyOnyx: @KYslippy xdd you don't wanna know
[3:18:15] MaverickD1: this became a legal stream LUL
[3:18:17] Kelborn: @Bluntblower_508 no one said anything about guns blazing, but you cant have your officers questioning themselves to the point of paralyzation during active scenarios
[3:18:18] lebaaaaaabs: It's a shame all NoPixel servers are the same right now - all LEOs struggling for numbers in this timezone but they all have plenty of AU/EU apps to fill it
[3:18:22] ViciousRumor: @CLERICssbu not sure on that
[3:18:24] ebos22: Cornwood still got that favor to call in to Max for letting him go on that traffic stop before the election. If he gets into to much trouble he can pull that card lol
[3:18:28] TheGhostlyOnyx: sniffthenewchatter
[3:18:29] Kiitzu: it's wild to compare the PD to onx... hell even np public server
[3:18:35] KYslippy: @TheGhostlyOnyx esfandLUL
[3:18:36] Jon_on_Drums: @Shmoopee you know the answer lol
[3:18:39] tommythetiger28: Snitch
[3:18:39] CLERICssbu: how do the three captains  receive the information they base their decisions off of?
[3:18:40] DevisR6: we snichting
[3:18:41] kasded: @Kiitzu TRU KEKW
[3:18:50] Death6707: Duncan

[3:18:55] Shmoopee: esfandLUL
[3:18:58] ChalupaBatman25: snitches get stitches
[3:19:02] Kelborn: @lebaaaaaabs and people like me who has IRL police experience and 20 years of RP dont have a chance in hell of even getting in the server to try and get on either
[3:19:12] romoleus: Is there a power vacuum with 2 captains but not having the chief of police being appointed yet?
[3:19:16] hollowrust: @EsfandTV you going to bed?
[3:19:17] romoleus: 3*
[3:19:18] RoloDage: isnt the PD being under duress the point of the RP?
[3:19:22] SkyeReaper: i believe the moment Den comes back ruth will dap him for something within his first shift, almost 99% sure of it because a lot of her reasons are subjective to begin with.
[3:19:23] Rockshock: @CLERICssbu Statements, talking to the officers and discussion it between themselfs
[3:19:25] leemuh_: HUH
[3:19:26] TheSlike123: @kyslippy sorry dont know what DAP is

[3:19:48] ELesEff: is that guy playing gtarp in a radio station
[3:19:50] SaelanTV: SaelanTV subscribed with Prime. 
[3:19:50] RetPaladinBot: @EsfandTV - SaelanTV just subscribed using Prime Pog
[3:19:51] taraannee: DAP = denzel aint policing LUL
[3:19:56] auxjack89: @rolodage that's actually a good point, it is a crime game
[3:19:57] KappaManJason: Ride with him TwitchConHYPE
[3:19:57] SeaDomo: Cornwood would look great on a police motorcycle. LUL
[3:19:59] CLERICssbu: @kelborn if you have irl police experience and 20 years of RP and have a fun and gravitating online personality there’s no reason why you wouldn’t be able to make an entrance onto the server
[3:19:59] KYslippy: @TheSlike123 for sure
[3:20:00] GILx87: Deep gullet esfandOkay
[3:20:17] CLERICssbu: majinShrug
[3:20:19] Kelborn: @CLERICssbu I have zero online footprint besides this account, i do not stream
[3:20:28] ViciousRumor: If Ruth DAPs Denzel again, I'm betting on a PD strike
[3:20:29] CLERICssbu: oh I see, these are all streamers
[3:20:30] Rockshock: Dont need to stream
[3:20:35] tommythetiger28: Lmao
[3:20:35] Khaosshinobi: i do think that DAPs should be voted for and not meant to be handed out like candy, they should be severe but they shouldn't just be passed out constantly
[3:20:44] Bhasgreth: @Kelborn I don't think streaming is a requirement for nopixel.
[3:20:50] StreamElements: https://gamersupps.gg/otk Use code “OTK” for 10% your purchase!
[3:20:58] Xen_Crypt: slacks did mention that
[3:20:59] Shmoopee: SCHIZO
[3:21:00] TheGhostlyOnyx: @CLERICssbu if you cna put up with long queue times or pay to get in the public I"d start there and make a name for yourself unless you feel lucky to go straight for WL
[3:21:01] smpies: tbh failed pd in 3.0 its more about player ego and too many non streamer player entering no pixel (stream sniper)
[3:21:08] Jon_on_Drums: judge dredd future
[3:21:09] Kelborn: @Bhasgreth yeah I know, maybe I should look into it instead of discounting it
[3:21:09] kasded: @ViciousRumor Denzel gets fired joins the crims and robs the lootbaxes what this server calls cops KEKW
[3:21:19] got3898: @esfandtv two minutes explanation of obstruction of justice  https://youtu.be/piJv677Wm90?si=Uay0zaRd-ZzEFuQw
[3:21:21] SkyeReaper: she only needs to give him 1 and unfortunately den is so hot-headed that he makes it easy. It'll take one rude criminal and she'll find a reason easily.
[3:21:23] raven1022: No streaming is optional but you basically need a streaming microphone though
[3:21:26] Bluntblower_508: @kelborn lol then dont be a cop. Idk what else to say. In life & in game if youre gonna rp or be a cop you should expect situations to be hard af at times but also have the brain skills to think on how to handle everything in a safer manner.
[3:21:30] blahder: And then he let the guy go at hospital
[3:21:33] lebaaaaaabs: @Kelborn The public ones are easy to get into and get your feet wet - no apps are required to fly in. Good opportunity to flex up to WL too
[3:21:49] greyjulian: @kelborn you miss all the shots you don’t take man.  go apply on the nopixel website!
[3:21:54] DazedenConfused: the Troopers learned a lot from Cornwood FeelStrongMan
[3:22:03] Warriorsora12: if denzel gets fired, he can wait until little texas opens up and become apart of the bcso
[3:22:04] Kelborn: @Bluntblower_508 I dont think we actually disagree like you think we do
[3:22:07] raven1022: How long the queue to get into public no pixel?
[3:22:08] Rockshock: People do tend to defend denz a bit too much in chats of streamers. and trash Ruth for it. Ruth is actually a really good character.
[3:22:10] smexy_lexi_: @kelborn as long as you have a mic and a decent computer. alot of people just rp to have fun. I know a couple of cops that do it for fun.
[3:22:13] Drackaine: you detain everybody, you dont know who the agressors are
[3:22:14] properenglishh: Hmmmm oh the Greats. Probably should of just minded their own business.
[3:22:20] romoleus: deploy pepper spray
[3:22:23] TheSlike123: @kelborn whitelisted nopixel dont demand you to stream since clayton in civ gang was a streamer before but in all of 4.0 he hasnt been live once
[3:22:31] hollowrust: streaming isnt required for no pixel but for white list server its kind of a necessity along with a subscription that is tier based in order to beat queue priority.
[3:22:34] Kelborn: @smexy_lexi_ oh yeah my wife streams so I have all the extra gear her sponsors sent her, so that is no issue at all
[3:22:39] ChainOfLightning: they were just yelling constantly, was frustrating
[3:22:42] CLERICssbu: you need to have a magnetic presence on your microphone and with your character I think
[3:22:55] CLERICssbu: this is basically a TV show
[3:22:56] rocker22_: 4 daps for aziz jeezzzz
[3:23:05] Bluntblower_508: @kelborn ahh, okie dokie. My apologies 🙏🏽😇💪🏽🤙🏽
[3:23:25] lzrdwzrdtv: bro Slacks pisses me off sometimes he just fucked Aziz
[3:23:26] Bluntblower_508: Every time someone gets a dap, take a dab.
[3:23:30] Rockshock: We already knew that rocker22
[3:23:35] Shmoopee: My brain is. mush.
[3:23:39] Kelborn: I used to RP with Bozo who is now one of the clowns here on NP, he used to be on DayZ underground with myself and a bunch of others
[3:23:44] Rockshock: And all three captains agreed on those 4 daps
[3:23:46] RoloDage: @auxjack89 yeah! thanks wirtL    It is all really fun to watch.  I admire the organization of the PD
[3:23:53] eebuK: @Bluntblower_508 deal, I'll do 3 just to be ahead of the game
[3:23:54] bluej255: that went smoothly
[3:23:56] hollowrust: @lzrdwzrdtv what he do
[3:23:57] smexy_lexi_: @kelborn honestly I start rping two years ago and I just watched people who streamed. there's a bunch of server that are easier to get into. you just got to look into them.
[3:24:01] Bluntblower_508: @kelborn thats whats up
[3:24:03] ZilzGaming: @CLERICssbu i dont think you need a magnetic presence
[3:24:09] omn___i: was that when Bobby brown was going crazy?
[3:24:17] 본쓰리프로덕션: ong cornwood
[3:24:23] JakeStratic: Honestly, you did great. If they want to keep yelling - detain them in a corner with cuffs away from others but you did great defusing the situation. Sadly, other officers didn't cuff the downed people @EsfandTV
[3:24:24] hippiecat: @esfandtv the Ramee, Mr. K and Officer Johnson incident relates to that other video you didn’t finishing watching https://clips.twitch.tv/AthleticInspiringLorisLitty-wZuH1ejBbAqei3HT
[3:24:28] Recon_XoX: @Rockshock What were the daps for?
[3:24:30] warner05: AZIZ JUST GOT ROLLED sgtaAH
[3:24:34] Kelborn: @smexy_lexi_ I honestly started with tabletop DnD in like 2003-2004 then DayZ when it was standalone
[3:24:38] cozmixlol: cozmixlol subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months, currently on a 17 month streak! 
[3:24:38] RetPaladinBot: @EsfandTV - cozmixlol just resubbed at Tier 1 for 24 months PogU
[3:24:41] CLERICssbu: @zilzgaming like it or not we’re closer to watching an episodic than watching gameplay
[3:24:42] Bluntblower_508: @eebuk lmfao 👏🏽🔥🔥🔥
[3:24:43] tommythetiger28: But if they're cuffed they can't defend themselves lol
[3:24:52] CLERICssbu: can’t be boring fs
[3:24:58] ViciousRumor: @warner05 What happened?
[3:25:06] Rockshock: You dont nee fun and comedy to RP lol. Just play a character you want to and go with it and do it good.
[3:25:11] warner05: @viciousrumor 4 daps
[3:25:13] smexy_lexi_: @kelborn then you got that foot in the door already
[3:25:15] blahder: You also explained your original order
[3:25:17] Rockshock: It doesnt need to be funny or hilarious or whatever clowny thing peple think you need
[3:25:21] blahder: Reexplained
[3:25:27] ZilzGaming: @CLERICssbu i mostly just meant some people's stream i've seen are super dull
[3:25:28] Phyloh18: haha
[3:25:43] Bluntblower_508: I wonder if theres any crooked cops on the force
[3:25:46] CLERICssbu: @zilzgaming that’s actually a good point sometimes I stick around just because I see people dedicating to their character
[3:25:49] Bluntblower_508: 🤔🤔🤔
[3:25:50] StreamElements: Watch my latest video: Cornwood & Bonnie go Patrolling - https://youtube.com/watch?v=zle3dhV8H9E
[3:25:51] ViciousRumor: @warner05 Oh, I already knew about the 4 DAPs
[3:26:02] haydsjone1: i aint never
[3:26:15] warner05: @viciousrumor He just got notified of them.  He's in shock
[3:26:24] ViciousRumor: @warner05 oof
[3:26:25] Irhssa: What’s DAPs?
[3:26:26] ToyLetTreat: im curious chat has  corn made any interactions with max after he became mayor?
[3:26:28] Bluntblower_508: @clericssbu sameee
[3:26:28] wispamii: you did say that too
[3:26:30] TheLadyCupcake: dap stacking PogU
[3:26:31] smexy_lexi_: @bluntblower_508 it's hard to be a corrupt cop on any server tbh.
[3:26:50] Recon_XoX: Captains are DAP stacking
[3:26:50] HungorianHotpockets: they gave him 4 daps
[3:26:52] Shmoopee: @toylettreat Once from what I've seen ? I dont remember
[3:26:55] Bluntblower_508: @smexy_lexi_ why? Too many snitches? Lol
[3:26:56] ViciousRumor: @Irhssa Discipline Action Points, get 10 of them and you get fired
[3:26:56] Kelborn: corrupt police typically have to be with admin approval or oversight for GTARP
[3:27:01] M__Wolfe: Aziz getting daped more than the SO lol, so backwards
[3:27:03] Shmoopee: RELAX AAAA
[3:27:14] IKEA_DOG: @HungorianHotpockets I thought they could only give 3 at a time?
[3:27:16] Irhssa: oh…
[3:27:18] Bluntblower_508: @kelborn thats insane
[3:27:18] Irhssa: Ty
[3:27:28] TheSlike123: @kelborn but the rank in nopixel when it comes to civs/crims ia heavely viewer based so the leaders of each group has the biggest viewer base
[3:27:30] smexy_lexi_: @bluntblower_508 mechanics make it hard
[3:27:30] Syn1285: can we do some policing
[3:27:33] TraviiiOnTwitch: @HungorianHotpockets 3 is where all 3 caps have to vote on it\
[3:27:34] JakeStratic: he foudn them? Esfand found them
[3:27:37] Kelborn: @Bluntblower_508 only because its difficult to pull off without admin help
[3:27:40] LXXELIFE: cornwood to save the pd
[3:27:40] HungorianHotpockets: aziz is getting 4 daps right now
[3:27:48] properenglishh: Well adin was from Pittsburgh and I started writing ✍️
[3:27:50] Rockshock: Everybody knows that
[3:27:51] smexy_lexi_: @bluntblower_508 what kelborn said

[3:27:55] k1nneDECIR: OMEGALUL
[3:27:55] Felaryn: @ViciousRumor high command review that can lead to firing its not automatic
[3:27:56] Rockshock: That Aziz is getting 4
[3:27:56] Bhasgreth: I'm not even sure a corrupt cop could exist. Too many good cops in 4.0 would figure it out quick.
[3:28:12] Fozenoh: dadgum idiot
[3:28:38] RoloDage: wait conrwood papercuffed someone? siick
[3:28:44] ViciousRumor: @Felaryn oh ok, I thought it was automatic. Good to know that the upper management has the final say
[3:28:55] 본쓰리프로덕션: SHITSHOW
[3:28:59] JakeStratic: You were not sure but you asked for PID of the checkered jacket changing and was given PID from Troy.
[3:29:08] Smapdi_Flaffermann: @Bhasgreth Then explain Archer
[3:29:12] properenglishh: KKonaW not number 2 but number Juan
[3:29:17] Bluntblower_508: @kelborn ahhh, I'm guessing it's like for a coverup or alibi type of scenario to clean their tracks so it can be good rp for everyone?
[3:29:21] ZilzGaming: did slack dap cornwood again during the clown stuff?
[3:29:22] Recon_XoX: Archer susge
[3:29:32] TheNachoManRandyCabbage: you had him put him in the car
[3:29:33] Rockshock: No, that was a joke lol
[3:29:39] Rockshock: He didnt dap Cornwood for the no tazer
[3:29:41] S1Nfx: whats stopping you from getting a new ped to fix your broken handcuffs? @EsfandTV
[3:29:45] Bluntblower_508: That blows.

[3:30:14] Felaryn: @ViciousRumor tbf getting a ton of DAPs has only happened to like 2 people and no one has reached 10 yet I think so it wouldn't be a widely known thing for people's chat cause its not a topic of conversation yet

[3:30:19] hollowrust: revenge for aziz
[3:30:20] haydsjone1: write a novel about it
[3:30:23] Kelborn: @Bluntblower_508 more of a balance issue because crims already have the upper hand on police, so the admin oversight is basically to make sure it doesnt get super unbalanced, otherwise youd have a corrupt copt cleaning out the evidence lockers and selling PD glocks etc etc
[3:30:32] Bluntblower_508: @kelborn & @smexy_lexi_

[3:35:33] JakeStratic: @JakeStratic Mr. K usually rocks it, maybe not today. Ramee and K do GREAT RP but because PD can't say no - Ramee gets carried away with thinking he can say wild shit and make up laws and he gets away with it. I mean Mr. K may not be charged for having a PD weapon because of the rules for DOJ. Of course they should argue if they can

[3:36:50] Rockshock: @JakeStratic Yeah, Perhaps, I mostly watch cop streamers so i dont really see the day to day internal RP they do. Vagos is only ones i've seen a bit of and it seems like a legit mexican streetgang style so

[3:38:16] JakeStratic: @hollowrust Can be but isn't fundamentally coming off that way right now. Denying a frisk at a shots fired goes against the RP that was developed to be able to do so.
[3:38:27] ShadowBomber: Who was talking bad about cornwood?
[3:38:33] kratoids: @ebos22 youre easily replaceable

[3:51:19] JakeStratic: @ebos22 It really shouldn't be about IRL. I can be understood but you don't force your RP on a server. The issue when peoples RP is greifing others unduly for their own RPs sake. AKA giving out 7 DAPs more for your own RP than for actual punishment in a non-corrupt PD.

[5:03:03] Pee_aRe: he wiffed it for himself
[5:03:03] puppietreats: lolol he was selling arms in g6
[5:03:04] Ancor_: none of the FTOs liked him and the gun stuff
[5:03:06] thatguydancingintheclub: h waved around his gun in RP g6
[5:03:07] Gurragam: yes
[5:03:08] mmmurple: All because he bought a gun and showed it at the g6 meeting
[5:03:11] IcebergTiger: Shouldn't you have gone to sleep long ago?
[5:03:11] rentasoldier: Cause then you can hire the amount of good cops that you need
[5:03:15] TXCVulture: he showed it at g6 meeting
[5:03:15] Toastbane: they told on him
[5:03:15] Verion: he bought a gun he shouldn't have, before having done gun training too
[5:03:17] tellos0: Bob told Slacks about it
[5:03:21] thatguydancingintheclub: this guy sorry for saying it is something special
[5:03:23] dapyman: He showed it at a meeting of 60 people
[5:03:28] kasded: Sadge
[5:03:29] captain_steve_420: He applied to be on the civillian board of corrections which cops arent allowed to do
[5:03:30] Strifelol: I miss Kyle, man :(
[5:03:31] tellos0: he was told not to buy a gun
[5:03:31] MahanGM: but is that enough to fire him?
[5:03:31] greyjulian: he promised g6 elite that they would all get weapon licenses and guns and then showed them his gun
[5:03:32] OldwisePaly: He brandished a firearm off duty
[5:03:34] Wiipotato: There was a report, from someone that wasn't there...
[5:03:35] bangsssss: he showed them, when they explicitly said to not do this beforehand
[5:03:37] Sniffle04: he was at a G6 meeting saying that soon they w ill be getting guns, just baiting ppl, never said he was selling guns or sanything
[5:03:38] thatguydancingintheclub: he is a good guy but he just has a vibe around him
[5:03:39] redmistintheair: que bugged?
[5:03:40] taraannee: its not just that, there was multiple reasons, it was a long convo amongst slacks, several srs & FTOs
[5:03:43] mmmurple: tbf he wasn't told that he couldn't buy a gun at that time
[5:03:44] blahder: They said cadets shouldn't have guns yet, and he didn't tell them he had bought one already
[5:03:47] Sanitydub: he got snitched on
[5:03:48] Sillyanne: idk the whole story was just watching ssaab and he mentioned removing him as a cop, but I wasn’t sure if that happened
[5:03:51] Janizki_Fin: @EsfandTV  they were all explained that the gunlicences are not for off duty. he goes and buys a 1911 and goes and shows it off to all theG6 in a 70 people meeting declaring him self as the CEO
[5:03:51] Muffinsrevil00: if cornwood has head he should call him to see if hes still awake and get that info imo
[5:03:52] JakeStratic: @EsfandTV He was seen 'showing his weapon off'. It had multiple reports. Seniors & capts discussed it but TBH they didn't have a clear report of the truth and voted on it anyways that he would fail this academy but maybe be allowed to go again @EsfandTV
[5:04:00] reetz99: flaunted it then 5 officers go robbed
[5:04:00] cr0pdus3r: Yeah he did a show and tell

[5:04:16] Felaryn: Brandished, talked to G6 and didn't tell anyone he bought a gun when he wasn't supposed to and then didn't step forward about it until the next day to anyone
[5:04:18] VincentsDeath: i would have love to see the River VS Duncan arc RIP
[5:04:22] MDM4ever1986HD: @MahanGM it's a mixed bag
[5:04:22] greyjulian: just a lot of red flags for River all at once, he needed to focus more on wanting to be a police officer
