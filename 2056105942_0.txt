[3:58:22] skinnylegend000: that’s senior material right there from Bones.
[3:58:22] sBuon: :)
[3:58:30] wavep987: that has to be the highest prio call going forward
[3:58:31] Nightbot: Come join the discord and fill up the ranks! https://discord.gg/PMrxK3F
[3:59:01] Setsuko143: why are they all at the same SPOT LUL LUL LUL
[3:59:07] Janman88: would make sense to atleast check another
[3:59:07] KillerKolsch: True they're all together
[3:59:15] RonJon: PauseChamp
[3:59:16] xIRodrigox: this is huge, need the big boss on scene
[3:59:17] sBuon: AAAA silence
[3:59:17] Nightbot: AAAA
[3:59:18] leo_bwo: I would think they would need to be checked at the very least, no?
[3:59:32] sBuon: HUHH
[3:59:35] ltl_wackman: PauseChamp the judge judgment call
[3:59:37] Smypher: You're on channel 2 right?
[3:59:48] Babushka_82: @Janman88 cus all of them same color?! sayeedK
[3:59:50] SilentStormAU: he switched to 1
[4:00:06] sBuon: AAAA
[4:00:06] Nightbot: AAAA
[4:00:10] jas3370: same colour, proximity to each other likely from the same ship
[4:00:20] RonJon: @Babushka_82 all from the same shipment from the same container company
[4:00:22] BLazOR_Prime: they all say merryweather on the side
[4:00:22] focustft: LOL
[4:00:24] ltl_wackman: yea you totally have reason to believe it but its like, where do you go next basically
[4:00:24] SilentStormAU: LuL
[4:00:24] RonJon: different than same color
[4:00:25] Janman88: @Babushka_82 bc they are in a stack ?
[4:00:26] sBuon: AAAA
[4:00:26] Nightbot: AAAA
[4:00:29] magnets_: OMEGAKEKW
[4:00:29] Nooshbag98: GAHAHA
[4:00:32] xIRodrigox: YEP they would be unloaded on the same spot all together
[4:00:34] magnets_: dayum
[4:00:37] Guielme: LUL
[4:00:38] NatsuiFPS: do you do content full time custard
[4:00:38] magnets_: "we go way back"
[4:00:40] BBAstronaut: thats disrespectful
[4:00:41] Koltary: we need a dev cop rq to show up
[4:00:51] muz9991: chat quick question, would it be an empty crate becuase there was no guns in there? Just curious
[4:00:51] Setsuko143: same color, same area  WHYYY?
[4:01:00] KillerKolsch: @xIRodrigox true and could say that the only reason they didn't open  the others was because pd arrived.
[4:01:06] hayleykopter_: HUUUUUH
[4:01:26] Koltary: @muz9991 highly not probable cause then it wouldn't be a heist
[4:01:30] jas3370: @muz9991 could maybe rp it as broken guns or empty mags left behind
[4:01:39] Cerkins: rp wise they could be rigged, they dont know much about whats inside and not safe as the promt says rob, it sounds like it shouldnt be opened by pd right?
[4:01:41] CrystalDimension: maybe those are for PD Kappa
[4:01:46] omascas: @muz9991 they responded to the alarm, we don't know yet
[4:01:55] Scully_18: m249a geeeez
[4:01:59] BLazOR_Prime: Shipping containers
[4:02:01] muz9991: ahh ok.
[4:02:02] Smoogol: Hmm the manifesto
[4:02:03] ltl_wackman: PauseChamp norman adams coming on scene
[4:02:15] sBuon: NOOO AAAA
[4:02:18] LazyAF: lmao
[4:02:20] BakinPacman: on scene till warrant LUL
[4:02:20] KillerKolsch: there's a but coming
[4:02:24] Janman88: they are in a stack
[4:02:25] wavep987: poor prop choice. probably gonna have to change.
[4:02:27] dylanconlon6: ask him to come down
[4:02:27] Setsuko143: should not have them TOGETHER, this fucks up the PD
[4:02:27] Sieder14: At least he didnt shut it down
[4:02:28] Janman88: ameno LUL
[4:02:29] KillerKolsch: okay cool
[4:02:30] 2OXXX: lmao
[4:02:30] BLazOR_Prime: warrant but no captains on duty?
[4:02:31] Sieder14: so thats good yeah
[4:02:31] omascas: an alarm was set off
[4:02:31] catfish_quackenbush: wait, so one of those containers were already opened when yall got there? crap means somone is on the streets with ARs
[4:02:39] eqnjn: Can you open them though?
[4:02:45] RonJon: if there wasn't a judge around to do a warrant would that count as exigent circumstances? lol
[4:02:50] MarauderHealth: Cheer100 Why couldn't Anakin Skywalker buy lunch for the Jedi Council? His Mastercard was declined
[4:02:50] Nooshbag98: all good make sure its done right
[4:03:01] xIRodrigox: its an active crime scene
[4:03:18] LazyAF: so anytime you stop a robbery of these you have to get a warrant to collect the stuff
[4:03:21] sBuon: @MarauderHealth actually a decent joke
[4:03:28] Scully_18: wait till cornwood hears there’s are m249’s ha
[4:03:31] chrisrox22: LOOOOOOOOOOL
[4:03:36] Xierany: I wonder if the car driving away got some AR's before they showed up, would be crazy for the server if so
[4:03:38] Sssaap: 30? ouch
[4:03:40] LazyAF: sounds like 2 much paper work
[4:03:41] DiaBeetusKoby: @lazyaf no it’s to open the other containers
[4:03:41] MarauderHealth: Thanks Buon!
[4:03:51] haleyheartt: I think cornwood should come down, he’s our gun guy Kappa
[4:03:54] ltl_wackman: @LazyAF well no, they need a warrant because its not in-progress, yea what diabeetus said
[4:03:58] dylanconlon6: who does the plate come back to
[4:04:03] Valagore: i feel like this is the same as the washers with "cash" in it, where it just has the texture even if they are empty
[4:04:17] Antaunik: I'd say box is labeled
[4:04:21] Athasin: @LazyAF If you saw a car getting robbed does that give you PC to search the other cars next to it? Or do you need a warrant?
[4:04:21] WhosHumble: doesn't matter because of the call no? indicates it?
[4:04:28] INKOMPLT: if its empty you shouldnt be able to see anything inside
[4:04:31] Sssaap: ok it's weapon boxes with AR imprints in the foam? not weird any longer
[4:04:39] Konkwistador_1002: the box probablu indicates its containments
[4:04:46] ToxiccLadd: even if they are empty they are still weapons boxes
[4:04:52] pcut: Well realistically there would be a way to track down a shipping container to the intended business. Containers next to each other wouldn't mean its the same destination per-say.
[4:04:56] wavep987: Guess, they have to say that this is property of Ammunition.
[4:04:56] BigDutchBag: they are empty boxes which appeared to hold firearms
[4:05:00] JTB_099: Shipping boxes would be marked with the cargo
[4:05:04] IanGK: Wouldn't Merryweather have these guns legally? otherwise why report stolen?
[4:05:05] rosecrimson: You got this!!
[4:05:07] JTB_099: to get through customs
[4:05:10] skinnylegend000: it’s better to roll with what you think you have than to do nothing cause of “weird”.  if it’s weird the judges will deny it.
[4:05:10] rosecrimson: I believe in you
[4:05:11] ltl_wackman: yea definitely a way to rp around it NODDERS
[4:05:16] xIRodrigox: they are all merryweather crates so...
[4:05:16] CoRnYy: storm smells
[4:05:21] Janman88: shipping crates are rarely just empty boxes ?!
[4:05:22] Kingofthabears: is there any dna at the scene?
[4:05:23] sunding88: @Lt_Custard labeling on empty boxes should be enough to articulate it all.
[4:05:30] Setsuko143: devs fucked up by making them all on the same Area and same Color LUL
[4:05:31] SilentStormAU: @CoRnYy no u smell :)
[4:05:31] ibrona: doesnt those crates belong o someone?
[4:05:32] BBAstronaut: found a box full of assault rifles that are all missing Hmm
[4:05:39] Sssaap: @Kingofthabears nah he checked already
[4:05:57] clowniusthe1st: Hmm
[4:05:58] LazyAF: @Athasin not really a fair comparison as cars have plates and vin to indicate a owner'
[4:05:58] Protaine: whoever stole those guns will give Cornwood one for free just for the lulz GIMMIE
[4:06:08] RonJon: @Setsuko143 Or, maybe this is exactly what the devs wanted. The cops to find them after someone's already taken a few
[4:06:12] rosecrimson: You got this!!!! You can work this out!
[4:06:17] TikiSmash: I'm curious who & how they were able to do this for sure
[4:06:18] Quacced: @sunding88 Yeah, but is it just a copy/pasted game asset?
[4:06:19] Athasin: @xIRodrigox And just because drugs were found in one Amazon trunk doesn't mean you can open all the Amazon trucks in a lot without a warrant.
[4:06:24] skinnylegend000: remember the gun bench warrants from 3.0?  I imagine similarly.
[4:06:30] SilentStormAU: dam shift 3 is gonna bea great meeting :D
[4:06:32] BLazOR_Prime: Shipping Containers
[4:06:33] greysapling: shipping container
[4:06:33] pcut: Shipping containers
[4:06:33] enzation: Cargo

[4:06:41] g0blue123: containers
[4:06:42] danda1orian: Cargo Container
[4:06:43] Omeezy510: dispatch call said they belong to ammunation no?
[4:06:44] Athasin: @LazyAF Shipping containers have serials and shipping manifests
[4:06:44] neutrofuji: Container
[4:06:47] dylanconlon6: containers
[4:06:48] RonJon: @Quacced even if it is, it's still there and they picked that asset for a reason
[4:06:49] killergoat20: This will get retcond as simmer happens in 3.o
[4:06:49] SweetWheat_: sea container
[4:06:50] orlandito03: sea crate
[4:06:52] Kittriss: Is there an argument for a manifest? There's always a manifest for shipped goods, it's necessary for documentation. You could argue what your eyes see is the manifest
[4:06:53] Setsuko143: @RonJon well the cops need to open the rest coz cops arent dumb
[4:06:55] sendu6666: container
[4:06:58] msnzonegamingadvocate: Some would call it a home
[4:06:58] Xierany: If it's intentional to give the crims AR's, that's crazy as the PD is already way down bad
[4:07:01] OutlandAsh: KEKW
[4:07:03] ToxiccLadd: AAAA
[4:07:03] Nightbot: AAAA
[4:07:03] clowniusthe1st: lol
[4:07:05] budogorilla: Sea cans is what they're called in the logistics industry
[4:07:09] Smoogol: AAAA
[4:07:24] ab_vii: lol
[4:07:30] shadowsnake1985: I blame g6 for this
[4:07:32] pottsie200: Secans is what those containers are
[4:07:36] wildarrow88: Ok all caught up on the crim side
[4:07:36] Quacced: AAAA
[4:07:41] captain_araujo: Eugene did it
[4:07:41] BLazOR_Prime: Weapon Smuggling
[4:07:47] spookyghost21: Weapon smuggling ?
[4:07:51] Smoogol: LETHIMCOOK
[4:07:52] TheLurkingOne: Devs used the wrong assets lmao
[4:07:53] Cerkins: LETHIMCOOK
[4:08:00] pcut: If the owning party has a license for the weapons then its not smuggling?
[4:08:00] LazyAF: @Athasin they dont have it in game but if there is a serial for the container in game then yes
[4:08:02] ixpops: i mean its just robbery or some form of that no?
[4:08:05] BakinPacman: actually what is the crime for not keeping weapons secure
[4:08:07] skinnylegend000: who will be the new criminal to blame everything on instead of Eugene?!
[4:08:12] dylanconlon6: weapon manufacturers
[4:08:19] TheLurkingOne: TheLurkingOne subscribed with Prime. 
[4:08:22] Reissthebeast: 0 Months $0 Everyone should be making guns
[4:08:25] rosecrimson: You can work this out
[4:08:27] Athasin: @LazyAF You can literally see all the markings on the container
[4:08:37] Setsuko143: weapon smugglers
[4:08:40] TheLurkingOne: Take My gifties I watched the alleged robbery.. Cops dont get enough love.
[4:08:40] ltl_wackman: NODDERS held until trial
[4:08:48] rosecrimson: Let's see those gears turn lol!!
[4:08:49] nictop007: can someone tell me in private who on the crim I need to watch to understand who did this?
[4:08:53] BakinPacman: is it smuggling or poor security
[4:08:56] shadowsnake1985: stolen firearms??
[4:08:56] chuppachopstbh: chuppachopstbh subscribed at Tier 1. 
[4:08:58] dkakr: 40k damnn
[4:08:59] Rune_883: Can pmc's have class 2's?
[4:08:59] Quacced: @nictop007 Yeah
[4:09:03] MajorPainCA: @Reissthebeast A judge rules on fine and time for those with 0-0
[4:09:05] ltl_wackman: oh thats a good point too tbh, stockpiling vs weapons trafficking
[4:09:10] skinnylegend000: send those locals to jail 4 life dawg
[4:09:11] wavep987: especially since this is the first robbery. A lot of stuff will need to be ironed out.
[4:09:12] KoppaVRP: Imean in RP you see the guns, yes they may of robbed what they took and not been able to carry more, but as a cop you wouldn't see the option to Rob so in RP your going off what you see no?
[4:09:20] LazyAF: @Athasin they cant put the numbers into the mdt so its not a mechanic
[4:09:22] MinotaurFluff: chalupaLOVE
[4:09:35] TheLurkingOne: Let him RP chat
[4:09:35] SweetWheat_: I'm an idiot, what does "HUT" stand for?
[4:09:35] pcut: Yeah thats a good way to handle it
[4:09:37] domthepalm: makes sense to me tbh
[4:09:42] Setsuko143: YUP FACTS
[4:09:42] 2OXXX: peepoBlanket
[4:09:42] frankprogrammer: crystLove crystLove crystLove crystLove
[4:09:42] wruper: it's up to the devs to work on it
[4:09:43] BakinPacman: thats the best
[4:09:43] Bayso: @SweetWheat_ held until trial
[4:09:45] Konkwistador_1002: makes sense
[4:09:45] pechamz: thats fair\
[4:09:45] Nekrus2: @SweetWheat_ hold until trial
[4:09:47] SilentStormAU: Held Until Trial @SweetWheat_
[4:09:52] BakinPacman: it can be determined at a later date
[4:09:55] SweetWheat_: tyty haha
[4:09:56] kittytaiyo: Hang on then what about those laundry machines with money in it?
[4:10:05] Bigeyez: That makes sense. Even if the guns aren't there it's obvious they are weapon crates
[4:10:05] MajorPainCA: What you see can be presumed identifying labels.
[4:10:05] BakinPacman: malton Pog
[4:10:08] Kittriss: What your seeing may be a manifest attached to the boxes you can see
[4:10:10] BakinPacman: malton cop*
[4:10:11] Omeezy510: yep dispatch called said ammunation container too
[4:10:18] courtneychar: oooh big case? what did i miss?
[4:10:20] Setsuko143: its Weapon Crates YES
[4:10:32] Smoogol: LookUp
[4:10:33] BakinPacman: gods help us PepeLaugh
[4:10:35] Reissthebeast: The clouds are talking?

[4:10:40] Death6707: AngelThump
[4:10:43] JTB_099: Wololo
[4:10:44] skinnylegend000: jimmy two times from the sky
[4:10:44] wavep987: What else can the cops do. They have minimal ooc and even ic knowledge of what happened. They have to go by the clues.
[4:10:47] SilentStormAU: the gods must be crazy PepeLaugh
[4:10:48] MinotaurFluff: LUL snuffPray thank you devgods
[4:10:49] Quacced: Save us almighty city developers!
[4:10:51] innk7: it’s similar too the washing machine spinning cash but is empty so idk
[4:10:56] msnzonegamingadvocate: Wololo
[4:11:01] Zacknado44: if this is a gun could it be weapons trafficking?
[4:11:05] TheLurkingOne: I mean its silly If they outlawed class 2s then they send ammunation a bunch of them
[4:11:07] clowniusthe1st: please tell me this was a dev mistake
[4:11:07] ltl_wackman: courtneychar mysterious ammunition crates robbery call. crate is empty. mcnulty responds and norman adams requests him to articulate search warrant to open the other containers
[4:11:12] msnzonegamingadvocate: Food please
[4:11:15] Bigeyez: If the devs want you all to leave that's dumb as hell. They shouldn't have it triggering a call then
[4:11:18] msnzonegamingadvocate: Stone please
[4:11:22] Setsuko143: devs shoudlnt make em all close together like that
[4:11:23] wavep987: This has to be like the old bobcat, without the killing of local guards part.
[4:11:25] Panos_97: AoE2 <3
[4:11:34] msnzonegamingadvocate: All hail, king of the losers!
[4:11:35] wildarrow88: @nictop007 i whispered at you
[4:11:38] s0stin: yea like you HAVE to asume you at keast know its weapons crate. company logo on it, munitions crate robbed on the call. i
[4:11:40] Sssaap: but yea, from a lore point of view, as security contractor surely the guns weren't illegally manufactured but are def stolen now?
[4:11:42] Reissthebeast: @Bigeyez its the first day of this being a thing so maybe skuff
[4:11:47] courtneychar: @ltl_wackman PogU interesting. thank you for filling me in
[4:11:49] omascas: when you say from up high do you mean Jesus or Joe Strummer?
[4:11:55] redemer12: Maybe it shouldnt have triggered a call
[4:12:00] TheLurkingOne: @omascas He means god
[4:12:08] Bananarsam: Debating joining nopixel sometime soon- any advice for a rookie rper?
[4:12:11] Omeezy510: wouldn't it just be treated like a bobcat robbery?
[4:12:14] clowniusthe1st: ltl_wackman lol hello again
[4:12:15] omascas: @TheLurkingOne so jesus or joe strummer?
[4:12:21] Kittriss: Ifs don't matter at this point
[4:12:24] lilisongss: they got admins they figure it all out it be fine
[4:12:30] IanGK: I assume Merryweather did this legally, don't think you'll get your warrant even though it'd be cool to see what's inside
[4:12:31] ltl_wackman: sodaL @clowniusthe1st
[4:12:34] Sssaap: @Omeezy510 something like that I'd imagine, yes
[4:12:36] TastyKudzu: The thing is if they're Ammunation crates then it's not illegal to have weapons inside. Only illegal to steal them. Ammunation has a license to have them.
[4:12:46] TheLurkingOne: @omascas Have you seen jesus and joe strummer in a room together?
[4:12:56] TheDev97: so cant stake it out i guess
[4:12:58] BakinPacman: That makes sense but its kinda scary LUL
[4:13:05] SilentStormAU: classic
[4:13:10] KoppaVRP: I mean that also makes a lot of sense
[4:13:11] ToxiccLadd: Hmm
[4:13:20] ltl_wackman: Sadge oh well. the approach made sense
[4:13:20] skinnylegend000: that sucks
[4:13:29] JaCoBc6799: makes sense though
[4:13:33] Bigeyez: That seems so dumb. Sorry.
[4:13:34] Janman88: feels like a mistake to not search them
[4:13:38] md783: LULW
[4:13:48] TheLurkingOne: Im down here searching a REDEACTED. Can I get a search warrant for REDACTED
[4:13:55] Setsuko143: so we wait for it to get ROBBED? LUL LUL
[4:13:58] killergoat20: Not mistake koil is in bones chat
[4:14:07] clowniusthe1st: ruh roh
[4:14:17] sBuon: this is admins saying what happened
[4:14:28] sBuon: this is not a Kian/Custard decision lol
[4:14:33] Ruffelso: this is gonna be fun
[4:14:39] sBuon: the scene is being set
[4:14:47] TheDev97: so bunch of legal shipments for ammunation store, but one got stolen monkaS
[4:14:47] Bigeyez: Yeah its not your guys call but man it seems like a dumb admin decision. So as soon as crims know this turns into a one stop shop for guns.
[4:14:58] colasmulo: PepeLaugh
[4:15:03] bandcourt: still there
[4:15:05] x__Shane: sniffthenewchatter
[4:15:08] BakinPacman: big crates PepeLaugh
[4:15:12] Valkyl: All those crazy locals must buy their ammo online and get it delivered
[4:15:13] ltl_wackman: yea at least an investigation can be built
[4:15:13] TastyKudzu: @Bigeyez You're assuming they don't need anything specific to open them.
[4:15:27] Setsuko143: or we play dumb  and just respond to calls NotLikeThis
[4:15:31] TheLurkingOne: If the Devs did just a crate with gun parts on or AMMO it would of been fine
[4:15:36] eborcurean: @Bigeyez crims get to do heists, that's why there was a dispatch call for it.
[4:15:39] sBuon: 40 subs away from 1200 OOOO
[4:15:58] KrazenSG: Ya I am interested in seeing how the admins deal with Stationary turn in spots.
[4:15:59] Bigeyez: I know but why put then all in the same location.
[4:16:04] ToxiccLadd: Hmm what a situation we have here
[4:16:13] LustigCoder13: buddhaH
[4:16:17] xMike6: Would u want for a bank for it to be robbed i guess is a good question
[4:16:20] xMike6: wait*
[4:16:36] RickmWolf: @TheLurkingOne I don't want to meta but you are on the right track
[4:16:36] goddamnsoul: Hmm
[4:16:39] Xierany: Giving the crims guns like this seems way too soon in terms of the state of the server. Balance of guns is perfect how it is right now
[4:16:44] ToxiccLadd: obstruction?
[4:16:46] Setsuko143: @TheLurkingOne yeah, now either cops will pretend to be dumb or patrol the area
[4:16:46] BakinPacman: wait is that a swatting
[4:16:50] IanGK: @TheLurkingOne agreed, they did the same with 3.0 bobcat
[4:16:52] JTB_099: felony obstruction
[4:16:55] goddamnsoul: Terrorism
[4:16:56] BakinPacman: Swatting in GTA LUL
[4:16:57] themanwithanrx7: sounds like obstruction of justice
[4:17:02] sBuon: just a reminder
[4:17:04] sBuon: !meta
[4:17:04] Nightbot: Metagaming is giving Custard information that his character does not know. Metagaming is strictly prohibited in this chat. Any offenders will be timed out, and repeat offenders may be banned
[4:17:06] sBuon: !rp
[4:17:06] Nightbot: Chat, remember this is a video game, Custard and anyone else in the server are playing characters.. The character's actions and words do not apply to their streamers nothing said or done is personal or OOC.. Please sit back, chill, and enjoy the RP ltcustLove
[4:17:11] Smoogol: RIPBOZO both felonys
[4:17:18] 90super__: @TheLurkingOne weird first time chatter
[4:17:27] ToxiccLadd: poor littlemans
[4:17:33] TheDev97: if anyone wants meta whisper me
[4:17:39] Reissthebeast: @Xierany The crate is empty all they know is that it's guns but they don't know if it's Class 1 or Class 2 just guns
[4:17:46] greenboy420: who got the guns?
[4:17:47] TheLurkingOne: @90super__ Call me weird fine but not first time chatter
[4:17:55] sBuon: @greenboy420 we don't know
[4:18:05] redemer12: @greenboy420 ill dm you
[4:18:06] Reissthebeast: @greenboy420 that's meta
[4:18:07] QuinnUnderscore: itsOK
[4:18:12] greenboy420: like ooc
[4:18:13] shadowsnake1985: @greenboy420 find out in Rp
[4:18:26] sBuon: @greenboy420 you ain't gonna found out in this chat homie AAAA
[4:18:27] redemer12: @greenboy420 check whisper
[4:18:31] icrywhenyoutry: @greenboy420 whispered

[4:18:56] greenboy420: thanks for the help guys <3
[4:19:02] pluck_it: add more patrol presence in the area
[4:19:11] BakinPacman: be alert for it i guess
[4:19:25] Jxckkooo: love the haircut custy
[4:19:32] pcut: Realistically if its an easy low risk heist and police can never make it in time Devs will probably make it take longer or increase difficulty.
[4:19:40] antzinoooo: someone whisper me who got the guns
[4:19:40] xolision: local id'd LUL
[4:19:42] Sssaap: from a logical standpoint though, how would you not watch them? clearly they're not secure by themselves
[4:19:43] CAPONE66420: lol nah cops shouldn’t be camping spots tbh @pluck_it
[4:19:54] Smoogol: hmmMeeting
[4:19:55] wavep987: 2 cops up on the roofs.
[4:19:57] lilisongss: can;t camp the hiest lol
[4:20:03] Spartoriius: rip jobs for the night
[4:20:04] pluck_it: @CAPONE66420 thats not camping lmao
[4:20:25] antzinoooo: someone whisper me who got the guns
[4:20:25] Mr_Mikeys: @pluck_it umm
[4:20:27] redemer12: i watched it live and it was crazy nerve wrecking
[4:20:31] Setsuko143: @lilisongss cops arent dumb
[4:20:35] lolSMCballs: they got AKs?
[4:20:44] pcut: Patrolling is not camping chat lol
[4:20:53] KaozVI: ^
[4:20:56] Smoogol: deterrence by using presence
[4:20:57] antzinoooo: anyone?
[4:21:03] antzinoooo: someone whisper me who got the guns
[4:21:03] 1TrueTyrant: You are doing the right thing and im a crime watcher
[4:21:05] watermelontoboggan: You good, can't play dumb
[4:21:07] xolision: can you close the box?
[4:21:10] KrazenSG: capable of closing door?
[4:21:11] IVoDI_Mz: @antzinoooo err
[4:21:11] 1TrueTyrant: its the logical thing
[4:21:13] Half_Wyse: @antzinoooo check your chat
[4:21:16] Sssaap: besides if it becomes impossible because there is no time between attempting the crime and cops responding its on devs to randomize spawns (if not already)
[4:21:19] KaozVI: @antzinoooo ur whispers are off
[4:21:19] slackeeeee: Crates about the be gate kept lmao
[4:21:22] skinnylegend000: Den not the time!
[4:21:25] pcut: It would makes sense to have increased police presence near docks + industrial area. Hes not saying to afk next to them to prevent mechanics lul
[4:21:33] goddamnsoul: Yeah guns on the street rip civs
[4:21:38] BakinPacman: its a code red LUL
[4:21:58] the_brandolorian: wait what was in the container?
[4:21:59] budogorilla: Robbing bonded containers alone is a federal charge
[4:22:08] Xierany: If anyone knows if anyone got stuff, whisper me
[4:22:12] sBuon: sniffthenewchatter
[4:22:32] Theburkeinator: den has DAP ptsd
[4:22:33] TastyKudzu: @Xierany Your whispers are closed to non-friends
[4:22:33] TheDev97: @Xierany ur whisper is blocked
[4:22:35] redemer12: @sBuon HeyGuys
[4:22:36] themanwithanrx7: Den it's been 15m, we're not gonna have SOPS already lmao
[4:22:40] antzinoooo: didn’t realise it was off
[4:22:42] NumbLee: poor den so scared to get dapped

[4:22:49] Athasin: @the_brandolorian "Empty" gun crates
[4:22:51] infinityapx: @the_brandolorian wispers
[4:23:00] antzinoooo: whisper is on now someone tell me
[4:23:24] redemer12: hit me up ill let ya know the sauce
[4:23:28] pcut: +1
[4:23:36] TheLurkingOne: Could you place a police barrier?
[4:23:39] twofaze017: I only wish the crates could look empty and not show class 2s
[4:23:54] millan147: yall should have yellow tape like the barriers
[4:23:57] Xierany: @Xierany Try again now
[4:23:58] Konkwistador_1002: evidence tampering if someone walks in no?
[4:24:07] rainejt: kinda wrong that cops also get the alt-eye indicator to rob the crate. it gives away more info than it should
[4:24:09] Reissthebeast: is this GTA 6?
[4:24:18] wavep987: Cops should get raid barriers that only they can pick up.
[4:24:18] ToxiccLadd: NODDERS
[4:24:21] sBuon: @Reissthebeast AAAA no
[4:24:28] zack12359: cant wait to see a selfie with someone inside on twatter KEKW
[4:24:30] TheDev97: @Reissthebeast its roblox
[4:24:49] Reissthebeast: @sBuon We could only wish GTA6 would have this much stuff
[4:24:57] Reissthebeast: NoPixel on top
[4:25:10] sBuon: @Reissthebeast I mean Rockstar owns both so Shruge AAAA
[4:25:25] zaps6666: they got a call and what the side of the crate ses they can def tell what it is
[4:25:30] kronn505: Susge
[4:25:36] LustigCoder13: @rainejt an issue to be fixed by devs; not something that characters will take into account
[4:25:38] Smoogol: WideSusge
[4:26:01] kronn505: peepoSus these cars
[4:26:02] TastyKudzu: I mean the call was robbery of an ammunation crate... It's not THAT difficult to guess what might be inside...
[4:26:04] Reissthebeast: @sBuon ooo I forgor that happened
[4:26:20] pcut: @LustigCoder13 Its not that big of a deal. It lets them interact to see if its empty or not because the textures don't give enough info and are static.
[4:26:29] Pritz247: Usually don't watch cop related stuff but investigations like this are always cool peepoHappy
[4:26:38] goddamnsoul: NODDERS
[4:26:40] 1TrueTyrant: Yep
[4:26:40] sBuon: custyWAVE bye all the meta hoppers glad you stopped by

[4:27:08] Nightbot: AAAA
[4:27:13] sBuon: feel free to drop a sub or a follow hoppers OK
[4:27:13] LiquidMemoria: harrRat
[4:27:17] Mr_Mikeys: @Lt_Custard I'm just asking a  question. Watching these crates is progression blocking correct? and big daddy said move on.? I don't personally care I'm just asking. Thanks
[4:27:18] ToxiccLadd: @xolision peepoStop
[4:27:19] Archangelos1: AAAA its a bright ass red contrainer that can be seen from the statosphere. Of course everyone is gonna come to dora it SNIFFA
[4:27:21] rainejt: @pcut i'm talking more about the multiple other crates, not the one that was just robbed. it would make sense that they could see the opened one.
[4:27:24] TheLurkingOne: LOL
[4:27:26] masterswordsmen23: perfect
[4:27:26] BakinPacman: what...
[4:27:26] TastyKudzu: @xolision yeah. You think your local gun store assembles all the guns themselves? Walmart sells guns.
[4:27:26] Bigeyez: Lol gonna need one soon
[4:27:28] LustigCoder13: @sBuon already done!
[4:27:28] aguy02: LULW WTF

[4:27:28] Setsuko143: LUL WTF
[4:27:30] bluntmeta: priorities
[4:27:30] CyanMig: rabies shot...shot=guns, perfect
[4:27:30] Quacced: HUHH
[4:27:44] boogity5: thought i saw it near the top on the right
[4:27:50] KrazenSG: I mean I wouldnt worry chat. If admins dont like what happens in a response they will tell them not to do it. It happened in 3.0
[4:27:57] ToxiccLadd: need like a rapid response team
[4:27:59] KrazenSG: Let them do whats nateral as much as possible
[4:27:59] ForgetMidnight: Rabies shot seems ideal, raccoons carry rabies and they are the animal world's bandits HYPERNODDERS
[4:28:04] Broitsjacoby: rabies shot is for when they got that dawg in them
[4:28:09] Setsuko143: patrol the area or guns will start to pile up
[4:28:10] spookyghost21: man that south east side of the map is just becoming more and more dangerous
[4:28:14] LazyAF: i dont get why police get a ping for it tho
[4:28:14] IsaackEz: Boats? Monka
[4:28:22] kronn505: Do you stop all cars/players when you guys go into the respond? @Lt_Custard
[4:28:25] Sssaap: technically they can just jump into the water to leave LUL
[4:28:27] Reissthebeast: Sir I can't read your license plate that's gonna be a fine
[4:28:35] CyanMig: if they blasted past you at 100 would that be RS?
[4:28:36] sBuon: chat rn KermitChat

[4:28:43] JaCoBc6799: true grimers
[4:28:46] TheDev97: mhm
[4:28:49] Bigeyez: Some good cop discoveries in RP today. First the crim rental stuff cornwood told McNulty about and now this
[4:28:53] TastyKudzu: @Sssaap Or hide the guns somewhere and come back later for them. Have nothing on them when they leave.
[4:28:57] RonJon: and theoretically could be armed and dangerous
[4:28:58] skinnylegend000: blast past at 100 that’s a 1k ticket we will take that!
[4:28:58] alyx_bunny43: Hi custy hi chat ltcustLove ltcustLove ltcustLove
[4:29:00] bluntmeta: so stressful having to think in game cop investigation and meta server mechanics to find the balance lol
[4:29:03] Wheez_3D: @LazyAF crate full of guns might have an alarm on it xD
[4:29:04] RonJon: but no way to know
[4:29:05] slightlytense: can people get boats or are those not available
[4:29:05] goddamnsoul: Being mindful that there might be guns stolen
[4:29:06] sBuon: good job not doing meta btw hoppers OK
[4:29:12] KrazenSG: @CyanMig ever seen a grime driver ? LOL
[4:29:22] Hogie48: Chat what did the dispatch call look like?
[4:29:25] CuBanMumzy: wake that sleepy head up, lol
[4:29:26] Sssaap: @TastyKudzu i'm just waiting for someone to start a grime job, put the guns in it and cancel the job to hide the guns Kappa
[4:29:29] RonJon: would stops on cars leaving one of these be high risk by default?
[4:29:30] dylanconlon6: she is she’s under lenny
[4:29:34] newby_lt: All by myself…
[4:29:38] SilentStormAU: dam thats a long ass garage :D
[4:29:40] CyanMig: @KrazenSG doing the robbery in a grime van would be so smart actually
[4:29:41] moozle: @sBuon OK I just like to see other perspectives
[4:29:53] Jaster_Reylu: @Hogie48 a red box said ammunition container robbery
[4:29:55] WhosHumble: @Hogie48 10-90, Ammo crate robbery
[4:29:58] sBuon: peepoPat hoppers did goo today
[4:29:58] Tamtomkamon: neutrenLurk
[4:30:05] TastyKudzu: @Sssaap Throw the guns in deep water and get their doctor friend to give them oxygen tanks. Unbeatable strat.
[4:30:12] Sssaap: right
[4:30:22] KrazenSG: @CyanMig ya if there weren't multiple levels to the heist.
[4:30:24] Icestruggler: hopefully there are multiple locations that cicle so theres no "unconcious" mechanic blocking
[4:30:28] BakinPacman: KEKW
[4:30:30] Reissthebeast: aikoHehe
[4:30:32] ToxiccLadd: xray radar go brrr
[4:30:39] milllajs: This is interesting from different pov's
[4:30:39] fubbes_93: there are so many cool escape plans from down there. justr get a bunch of grime people down there to start there jobs and get out with them
[4:30:40] Perfer0: xqcCheer
[4:31:01] rainejt: it's definitely interesting to see the response. what this also tells me is that PD needs more/better officers to deal with the new mechs
[4:31:03] masterswordsmen23: can you technically even say stolen fire arms?? i mean honestly you dont know what was in there
[4:31:07] goddamnsoul: wideVIBE
[4:31:08] themanwithanrx7: itsn't the race in like 30m too ?

[4:32:20] shadowsnake1985: @mrinquisitor agreed
[4:32:33] masterswordsmen23: i mean based on how the crate looks ehh, but even then whos to say what was inside
[4:32:44] sBuon: 15 subs away from 1175 OOOO

[4:35:05] Sssaap: @masterswordsmen23 the manifest the company provides when they reported the break in. just not very detailed content because secrecy etc I guess
[4:35:16] Battenhall: AmmuNation is the company
[4:35:19] chunce0: ammunation the store

[4:44:05] shadowsnake1985: @fozenoh they don’t know they have to assume crate had guns and ammunition
[4:44:22] Xierany: If you get caught with a single legal gun, what is the charge then?
[4:44:23] ToxiccLadd: is there any possession charge for non pd firearms?
