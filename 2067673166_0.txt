[0:39:04] Bacon_Space: was this a dundee doing?
[0:39:04] nupustass: wdym isnt it better?
[0:39:05] Sax850: also no one was doing g6 at all these past days, like only the tier 3 drivers
[0:39:08] Kryptic_Light: @whippy Are the stills going to turn into the secret spot?
[0:39:09] Fellowpine6: @whippy can you place the box twice
[0:39:19] rcmartinez2441: Looks like..... *puts on glasses* crime doesn't pay... YEAAAAAAAHHHHH!
[0:39:20] DDDDAAAAANNNN: yep
[0:39:21] ReinBork: You might get more money for the more dangerous deliveries
[0:39:24] DDDDAAAAANNNN: 7 per
[0:39:35] baxsm: peepoHey
[0:39:37] Kinson1: You say nerf, where staff may say balancing.
[0:39:53] TheJmJ: More on the riskier ones though? Hmmge
[0:39:55] KitKatSNAAAACKS: Crimes aren't paying... it's impossible to start businesses... WTF is with this economy lmao
[0:39:55] Bacon_Space: peepoSprint pepeWrench
[0:40:14] Sax850: it isnt impossible anymore @kitkatsnaaaacks
[0:40:22] Sax850: business licenses are "live"
[0:40:23] DDDDAAAAANNNN: much simpler
[0:40:32] agentofchaoso7: @kinson1 then why not start with g6? if anything that’s what’s putting the most in the game economy
[0:41:05] h1tman87: with the ai not taking the box the 100 less i guess counter acts that
[0:41:05] KimgamingFB: love your energy and RP. is it ok to@ask if you are loyal to a gang or just going with the flow
[0:41:07] Sax850: there is like no one doing g6 anymore beyond the the tier 3 drivers basically @agentofchaoso7
[0:41:08] DDDDAAAAANNNN: make mo jewels then AAAA
[0:41:12] whereishegoin: @rcmartinez2441 LUL nice
[0:41:15] KitKatSNAAAACKS: It is, but it isn't. It's expensive and the gov't isn't helping at all. If the business you want to start doesn't actually have the product available, you have to wait for it to be introduced into the game
[0:41:26] agentofchaoso7: @sax850 ahh ok fair enough
[0:41:38] KimgamingFB: I’m new so don’t know so much about the old stuff
[0:41:48] simon_lob: Aware
[0:41:49] ThaAlmightyPete: LULW G6 grinders
[0:41:52] Kinson1: @KitKatSNAAAACKS Their attempt to make things more realistic. Actions of consequences. In 3.0, most every business was owned by a criminal who had been convicted of some serious crimes like terrorism.
[0:41:53] Sax850: they did legal and illegal work
[0:41:53] Rubixc1999: AAAA
[0:41:59] rcmartinez2441: I think they should nerf G6
[0:42:10] DDDDAAAAANNNN: someday thesta124B thesta124B thesta124M thesta124C will be up good Prayge

[0:42:22] Kinson1: @agentofchaoso7 I can't say, as I am not staff. Sorry
[0:42:35] ReinBork: Doesn't Jason do Sani runs?
[0:42:35] whereishegoin: uP gOoD
[0:42:37] Sax850: why @rcmartinez2441
[0:42:43] ThaAlmightyPete: Aware just insulted 95% of the server
[0:42:51] shacklyn: you had the bad luck of choosing to start at mosley's for a month - when it was the worst-paying legal job in the city
[0:42:51] agentofchaoso7: @kinson1 yeah almost everyone had like DT, murder, or treason AAAA
[0:42:55] KimgamingFB: saw you for the first time the four Glendale heist with the company. loved it
[0:42:57] Sax850: i mean thats why the rep system is trying to stop @whippy i think
[0:42:57] fatpig1826: it's too real life PepeHands
[0:43:01] ShaqMaker: Can cops be crocked
[0:43:03] Ughers: It's hard to be gangster when you roll up on your g6 buddies lol
[0:43:05] ShaqMaker: In this rp
[0:43:07] yolfiic: makes sense lmao
[0:43:09] ThaAlmightyPete: No but sadly its not enforced
[0:43:11] fatpig1826: work multiple jobs PepeHands
[0:43:17] TheeBudz: Nah its gotta make sense for their character NODDERS
[0:43:23] skutza: it's wrong to say someones rp is shit, just because it's different to yours but I can somewhat agree.
[0:43:25] nummento: different times man, they dont care about that anymore.
[0:43:27] Bacon_Space: hands tom a pepeWrench here you go
[0:43:43] wavep987: I think its a slow build up to all the violent felons being fired from civ jobs. G6 now, other jobs later.
[0:44:05] simon_lob: no but it makes no sense for them to also do crime because theyre already rich
[0:44:09] whereishegoin: then they shouldn't don't do crime imo
[0:44:39] Bacon_Space: !rusty
[0:44:39] Fossabot: Mike 'Rusty' Kowalski is played by ------> https://www.twitch.tv/bloomonline
[0:44:43] neybersaber: Rusty eyes are closed :(
[0:44:45] Kinson1: WHAT!? Rusty did a 10-Ziggy?
[0:44:58] ShaqMaker: People are down bad
[0:44:59] Ughers: At least crims have stuff to do this time outside of heists.
[0:45:06] KimgamingFB: but I think a mix work though. if you look at OTT for example he grinds like crazy to bring money for the criminal side. but I understand your point
[0:45:19] baxsm: exactly
[0:45:23] Sax850: @whippy Motya has basically been a exclusive G6 workerm fully dedicated - hell he is even a shift supervisor at G6. The money I've gained is all for my future business and help fuel Tess illegal shit basically.
[0:45:31] simon_lob: yup
[0:45:55] TheeBudz: KEKW Yo Dawg stay off my turf. Ill check to see if your gone after my Snr Buns shift AAAA
[0:46:00] Pjosk___Bey__xD: well 60-80% of the server suck at staying true to their character and even the best fall off from time to time.
[0:46:04] Sax850: I tried to help Alex/GiantPanda to grow G6 into something more
[0:46:07] Kinson1: @Sax850 whipMETA

[0:46:59] SlashThePriest: Why not a bike?

[1:45:57] Usahi_Light: again or was it the hydra thing
[1:45:59] Kryptic_Light: @whippy I feel like you should need a good reason to destroy stills instead of just walking up and destroying them
[1:46:00] nl_f0x: Lame.

[1:47:11] JoshRSQ: @floody555, seems suspicious.
[1:47:17] Lifeonfire22: GTArp is Rust now

[1:48:01] Deakula: So, y'all are actually getting meta griefed?
[1:48:11] dlucre: You need help from the Gods to figure out who this cunt is whippy
[1:48:12] NoranorTV: For sure
[1:48:12] Mr_Tvi: Disgruntled G6 worker

[1:48:26] nl_f0x: sounds like it
[1:48:27] neybersaber: alt f4 = quit?
[1:48:28] jjanieee: I believe so too
[1:48:29] skutza: yeah none of the boys would destroyed them, they were very upset the first stills were broken.
[1:48:30] NoranorTV: Sounds like it with that alt f4 tbh
[1:48:34] neybersaber: what is grieft?
[1:48:36] WolfVisionGaming: I think someone might be doing it on purpose
[1:48:43] fatpig1826: it does sounds suspicious
[1:48:44] Domebuddy: mods can investigate that stuff right?
[1:48:45] romfi: Sussy

[1:49:05] Lunar_Delta: @so_sneaky whipLove hello
[1:49:06] jschrage10: you are 100% getting meta grief and it’s bs
[1:49:09] DieMrCupCake: No. Even meta chat thinks its odd it keeps happening
[1:49:10] DOWNBAD_ELLY: Jason is played by so_sneaky I think
[1:49:10] fluffycartel: Whippy there's logs on server right can't you report that
[1:49:11] dlucre: ALT-F4 is fucking dodgy

[1:49:48] DOWNBAD_ELLY: They might be in here right now monkaW
[1:49:50] Wireless_AeON: "being a shitter"
[1:49:57] fluffycartel: Tbh cornwood got alt F4d last night
[1:49:59] DrCached: @Whippy Each item has a GUID in the database.  they can look at what person's ID destroyed it im pretty sure*
[1:50:01] LTsprinks: no its just people being weird
[1:50:01] MDCproject: Better to report and move on than assuming or accusing to chat. Don't put yourself at risk with what-ifs.
[1:50:08] MegaKarp101: @jschrage10 only way to prevent is to hide screen and meta guard his stream which is Sadge
[1:50:27] Deakula: Just gonna have to metaguard everything I guess, which is really unfortunate from a viewing standpoint, but ya gotta do what ya gotta do
[1:50:29] DieMrCupCake: Having to meta gaurd is so ass
[1:50:45] Deakula: Yeah, that's really telling
[1:50:47] JoshRSQ: @MegaKarp101, Its dumb that that has to be the solution.
[1:50:53] nicatude: sorry... i'm late
[1:50:53] slyoperator: then that is Sussy
[1:50:54] JohnnyBThunders: metaguard everything: never show the game on stream at all

[1:51:03] Deakula: Become a podcast streamer
[1:51:06] fluffycartel: I say meta guard from now on
[1:51:07] xetrovj: yeah it just makes it more suspicious
[1:51:09] gmsgaming_: 100% they will have logs, all items in city have a code for  example Pallet#0203 or something like that so mods can see what u put down and then see who picked it up.... also the moonshine they can see who destroyed it

[3:47:49] SalVl: Hello Whippy and hello Tom! It is day 19 of not having internet, and I found out that I am the ONLY person in my dorm that doesn't have it. But that is okay,  as I have gotten access to my school's Esports PCs because I am a coach for one of the teams. But this reminds me that I must send people positive vibes too. Make sure you all are eating, hydrating and self caring as those are all important. I am proud of you all, and love you all. Love Sam.
