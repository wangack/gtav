[4:56:35] Thebreadlord: I really don’t see how the Mayor wanting to create an actual chain of command in a reasonable amount of time was bad. and correcting a f’d up situation. the money thing was a huge OOF however

[5:29:26] fanatic101_: unions never work KEKL

[5:29:40] Artsii1994: Pd is just gonna be a fight on who wnats to take over and controls what
[5:29:40] JC9R_: makes sure the people putting the money in are the ones getting rewarded instead of part timers/no shows getting incentives
[5:29:52] OniZetsumei: unions help against retributive action. so if the PD goes on strike for having to pay for everything retribution for the strike cannot be taken against individuals
[5:30:01] lopololoko: I think it was perceived as needed a few weeks ago when many officers felt ignored and mistreated
[5:30:01] xDabmanDanx: @senpaiskeptik EZ Clap.
[5:30:21] samealb: If there are “dues” naming it a union or not it accomplishes the same thing!

[5:32:29] TokSykMorty: Lurker here, but I will answer why you need union here.. If EVERYONE was willing to buy into it, then it would work as doi ng it for the whole PD, but if EVERYONE doesn't want to buy in, there has to be a divide over who gets benefits and who doesn't, thus a Union is needed where dues are collected from those who want in and they get benefits and thoes who dont and wont get benefits.
