[0:10:29] Juggerit: Not an RP question but did you ever get an Ace in any of Marleys siege videos lol?
[0:10:33] aguy02: isnt it a lot of office stuff?
[0:10:35] watermelon3001: Chief or nothing GIGACHAD
[0:10:38] vicvega00: High command rp not fu ?
[0:10:39] plawpsruby: Maybe go if beric allows him to patrol a decent amount
[0:10:43] vicvega00: Fun
[0:10:52] JediJacob_: it'll be just a good conversation to have though.
[0:11:10] kaleidoskopeyes: but he could be Big Dog’s Ass. Chief
[0:11:12] plawpsruby: He's a patrol cop but is willing to sacrifice the patrol to better his shift
[0:11:20] AndresSaysHey: Just be like "it should be Ruby dawg"
[0:11:27] random_viewer_55: more like pursuit cop
[0:11:45] themanwithanrx7: well none of the roles are forever, so you could always do it for a few months and step down
[0:11:47] JediJacob_: you and beric we're the unofficial high command towards the end of 3.0 right?
[0:11:50] SymbioAgori: with how he talks about cards and pursuits it looks like he is patrol cop from other povs
[0:11:52] condssm: More Sgt type?
[0:11:54] plawpsruby: Maybe a conversation with beric will help you decide
[0:11:58] FlameReetardantPanda: c'mon chat, McNulty is a patrol CAPTAIN, will it into being
[0:12:20] LockNLoadJesus: as ass chief you can make a detective squad and do investigations like that.
[0:12:21] bryson2834: I see McNulty more as an investigative pursuit cop
[0:12:28] watermelon3001: will this into being bazzShake
[0:12:47] WhosHumble: shift lead fits more
[0:13:07] random_viewer_55: also I feel like you'll become the chiefs paperwork bitch
[0:13:16] FlameReetardantPanda: I love when people don't understand the idea of prioritizing shift 2. like what are you gonna do, not focus on the shift you were made senior for?
[0:13:20] JediJacob_: if you apply what you do for shift 2 into other shifts it'll 100% better them all across the board
[0:13:32] xMistressMayhem: McNulty Has an Air of command about him, He likes to ensure people are doing what they need to. to get the best outta his officers
[0:14:04] Tabah: Does moving up to Sgt. or Cpt. mean you can't only focus on Shift 2?
[0:14:15] plawpsruby: Kian just has to be honest and see what beric thinks
[0:14:37] vicvega00: How personally did york take the mayor's comments?
[0:14:38] random_viewer_55: since you didn't place interest probably he won't ask you to do it
[0:14:41] bryson2834: So u gonna do something similar like u did with sweets
[0:14:44] watermelon3001: Chief or nothing NOPERS Assist this bazzShake
[0:15:12] Tabah: Chief of Police..... for shift 2
[0:15:18] random_viewer_55: @Tabah up to Lieutenant you don't have to give a shit about other shifts
[0:15:34] xMistressMayhem: Shift Lead would be very suited to McNulty he just wants the best for the officers and the city
[0:16:55] xMistressMayhem: Do we know the outcome of O and the lost
[0:17:00] toffeetovvers: still don't know what happened to sweets
