[1:34:48] Goldfish_Vendor: Some games need to just not have sequels
[1:34:54] glacialis__: AC but it's just the great-great-grandkid running his bar. @UberHaxorNova
[1:34:56] tr3y919: ghosts cinematics were so amazing
[1:34:58] MKTheGreat: Assassin Creed games now are way too big and dont really have a good story anymore

[1:35:28] Dmg121389: I still don’t understand the over all story of assassins creed. They should just made you play as the assassins through time without all the animus stuff
[1:35:30] SirFaulkinator: Ready for the new Mario Party?
[1:35:31] JackTehSippah: The thing Assassin's Creed did to innovate and try something new that really blew me away was the ship stuff in AC 3 and Black Flag. That shit was great
[1:35:38] ShadyPCE: god of wars on pc now
[1:35:42] TaroTartare: the duels in Ghosts were my favorite parts
[1:35:44] FletchSin: @BaneZarfox i hope things get better for ye bane ;.; terrible sleep is never good
[1:35:47] 2spooky4spooks: the duels were PogU
[1:35:50] placeholder2154: AC used to be more focused. The open world stuff is done to death and should be put to bed unless a dev is going to do something groundbreaking with it
[1:35:51] fotdaymon: oh yeah the new mario party
[1:35:52] kirstarchia: It looked gud
[1:35:53] Tacoria1: ghost dlc was amazing

[1:36:28] ryujain: the side quests were pretty deep
[1:36:29] chocodreamzzz: FryCry season 6 KEKW
[1:36:30] Dmg121389: Ghost become a game I didn’t know if I’d buy to one of my favorite games. Wish you could get different weapons though
[1:36:34] Holrend: first 2 is fun then its gets boring
[1:36:34] 2spooky4spooks: NODDERS
[1:36:35] jawnwick99: I enjoyed Ghosts of Tsushima. I remember just wanting assassins creed to end
[1:36:41] JackTehSippah: Ubisoft milks not only a franchise but a formula for all it's worth LUL

[1:36:43] BiggieBoy420: Whats that game? fall cry 6 or somtbing?
[1:36:44] vxlozity: The bamboo mini game was pretty good
[1:36:45] Sleeplessbard: yeah unlocking different stances and skills/weapons in each area really was tedious and didn't change from the beginning you're right.
[1:36:46] Atrofiya: i think red dead 2 rlly helped make side missions more interesting
[1:36:50] kirstarchia: Ghost of Tsushima Nopixel LUL
[1:36:52] voxfantastic: The boat shit gets worse every game since Black Flag. It's wild.
[1:36:54] Atrofiya: the random encounters was done rlly well
[1:36:54] NvertedDynamo: LUL NODDERS
[1:36:57] TrebleDriver: Arkham Knights had some variety with those
[1:36:58] placeholder2154: Not open world is the alternative, which is desirable. Please, put me back on rails devs
[1:37:06] TrebleDriver: Arkham Knight*
[1:37:15] Baille: I think something that keeps me doing muntane tasks is spontaneous interaction from the game, like some random NPC coming up and fucking with you LUL
[1:37:17] Baille: mundane*
[1:37:23] jaydwag11: @atrofiya Red dead 2 is actually a slogfest imo
[1:37:28] Dmg121389: A new Arkham style type series with another dc hero would be sick
[1:37:33] Holrend: Arkham Knights had the riddle question marks
[1:37:33] tr3y919: rdr2 i think does open world great by making side stories/random encounters very interesting
[1:37:33] tinytoadtiddies: @UberHaxorNova would you ever consider a game like Beasts of Bermuda? would be funny to see you try and survive LUL
[1:37:36] MKTheGreat: LUL
[1:37:37] tombovard: KEKW
[1:37:37] chocodreamzzz: i miss linear game play, that for sure

[1:37:50] Baille: JamesPog WOAH its mildly polished
[1:37:51] lobo8gris: MannyB1 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! <3
[1:37:52] placeholder2154: NODDERS
[1:37:53] jaydwag11: every mission in RD2 has like 15 minutes of walking
[1:37:54] Im_Harold: Open world wouldnt be bad if they pushed you in a linear direction and not level based zones
[1:37:56] kirstarchia: 100%
[1:37:57] UwUzi_blAYAYAp: Open World is fucking annoying when they don't bother to fill the fucking world you're in KEKW
[1:37:58] Drax_1X: Cuz it's a curated show at that point
[1:37:58] zachary_224: Truuuuuu

[1:38:01] JackTehSippah: I mean, that's why I loved Psychonauts 2 so much. It's so focused and tight in what it wants to do and say
[1:38:03] Zombiemind21: @uberhaxornova would you ever try Alan Wake remastered?
[1:38:03] ANDRO_core: It takes a long long time to make a polished good open world game but the problem is most studios make open world games like they make cods every year and they just look and play like shit
[1:38:03] AudioPhant0m: chalupaNODDERS chalupaNODDERS chalupaNODDERS
[1:38:05] Dmg121389: The Mordor games were too broken to enjoy
[1:38:09] Baille: [EARLY ACCESS] [OPEN-BETA] uhnRee RELEASE A FULL GAME
[1:38:09] SirFaulkinator: 2D scrolling again pls
[1:38:09] CabinFrost: Played the 1st Dishonored recently and that was a good game
[1:38:12] Joshiewahhh: linear campaigns do better at story telling, generally speaking
[1:38:15] tombovard: the novelty of being able to do whatever got old KEKW
[1:38:16] b__u__n: i feel like open world stuff should be on the side and not required in a main story
[1:38:17] glacialis__: I think a good example of that was MGSV
[1:38:17] Atrofiya: @jaydwag11 funny enough as much as i was enjoying it and thought those encounters were great i still havent finsished it lmaooo i think bloat is a huge problem now
[1:38:18] SA3G421: has anyone else seen that new Choo Choo Charles game?

[1:38:44] CooCooKachew: I just want the Star Wars KOTOR remake to be good NotLikeThis
[1:38:46] Ham_Alh: Last of us 2 was good in being linear while having that one open area

[1:39:17] pear_juiceman: mgsv got repetitive to me, idk if it was because i was using Quiet as 2-man or the missions lol
[1:39:21] arsh___: Will you ever beat this game called Minecraft uhnEvil
[1:39:22] ANDRO_core: @chocodreamzzz idm that when it's optional and when the quests actually have their own little interesting stories, but most just do shitty one dimensional side quests
[1:39:22] Baille: Open rails KEKLEO
[1:39:24] Luroloro: open-ish
