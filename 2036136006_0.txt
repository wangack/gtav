[0:16:11] ltl_wackman: thats why i watch cop most of the time lol but then like you said its a lot of conflict
[0:16:17] scha_de: It's the same with PD conflict, like currently with the captains
[0:16:18] N_eel: I would define 4H as a lolcow, so it's a little more pronounced
[0:16:24] quadity2: Should have seen NMP's chat while in conflict with X, major cringe.

[0:41:29] gostonko: !meta
[0:41:29] StreamElements: Telling Nidas information that he wouldn't have known without you telling him in the stream. For example if you're watching another stream at the same time and telling Nidas things that are actively happening on the other persons stream. Doing this will get you timed out or banned.
[0:41:31] ikrstfu: WHAT this rust game looks so different now
[0:41:31] etopplol: NODDERS true
[0:41:33] swankytiger942221: Yup

[0:42:53] srirachawoah: I think it will figure itself out
[0:42:55] WundertueteGER: you can just ban them Kapp
[0:42:56] luckerooni: it makes conflict very easy to happen for low stakes on the aggressor
[0:43:09] swankytiger942221: Yeah but that stuff happens sometimes. It does suck tho
[0:43:10] JakeB27: I hope it stays as it is, its great
[0:43:20] fublian: Yeah think you should be able to like keep a few things safe, but you have to pick what matters most kind of
[0:43:20] edison2000: Maybe physical keys was a bad ideea?
[0:43:21] srirachawoah: yeah some limits would be nice
[0:43:21] Llaplace: hello nidas!! hellooo chaaat!
[0:43:22] rikzoo: feels way too easy to lose everything
[0:43:27] swankytiger942221: It makes good rp which is the point
[0:43:28] zvidrvhim: They got sent back to the stone age in terms of progression
[0:43:33] scha_de: I think the problem rn is that a gun is just OP atm
[0:43:34] AfroAltruism: I’d be pissed in the way of progression but that’s a huge follow up arc that can be a slow burn or quick one
[0:43:37] 911_raj: I mean I think it's time to have some traps in the house
[0:43:39] Andr3wxy: house security alert or something could be great
[0:43:47] Chr12x: maybe there add a way to upgrade to code locks or something
[0:43:50] blackpoolftw: no offline timer mhm

[0:43:56] tim212_: I kinda dislike the camping shit
[0:43:59] ikrstfu: this is rust now Aware
[0:44:02] NemisizZ: the worst is, there is ppl like that
[0:44:04] JakeB27: would be good for security stuck in the future. like alarms and guard dogs etc
[0:44:07] swankytiger942221: Yeah there should be a rule that half your people have to be on. That's fucked
[0:44:07] gurglet: no offline raiding rule incoming
[0:44:08] ELEGlGGLE: @ikrstfu Aware
[0:44:10] fublian: Yeah I think house robberies without any RP story behind it should not be a thing. At least not early on
[0:44:11] Suetek: Literally add a double barrel shotgun and its rust
[0:44:15] WundertueteGER: imagine getting fully wiped and having to start from day 1 again KEKW sounds fun
[0:44:18] rikzoo: if people in chat call that RP i think we've lost the plot PepeLaugh
[0:44:19] highrollergambler: always better than offline raiding foheadOk
[0:44:19] tim212_: the worst part will be holding people up and forcing them to unlock the door
[0:44:20] joe_poop: Yeah hide in a bush for an hour and just catch you lacking
[0:44:21] srirachawoah: very much rust Rp
[0:44:21] walkgleesh: rust rp
[0:44:22] bilvari: Imagine the same with guns also its so much easier
[0:44:23] Zardete: That's rule break though, you can't think that people would do that even if we know some will
[0:44:26] AfroAltruism: oh no that’s cringe I assumed there was a motive / intention
[0:44:28] ikrstfu: start gathering stone next update Aware
[0:44:30] Suetek: Right now everyone has key locks on their doors like from rust
[0:44:38] CuppaT_XYZ: @WundertueteGER everyone says they love the early slow burn RP Clueless
[0:44:40] contrangle: i think multiple keys for each door can fix it
[0:44:43] Suetek: Need code locks or some shit
[0:44:54] pratxp: Don’t hate the player hate the Game
[0:44:56] tim212_: would be good if there was a security system you could upgrade
[0:44:56] rikzoo: peepoClimb
[0:45:03] scha_de: where is he going with this OMEGALUL
[0:45:06] edison2000: Maybe devs could make things accessible only if you have acces from the pad?
[0:45:08] Mandan0: no Leslie in 4.0? @Nidas
[0:45:08] WundertueteGER: @CuppaT_XYZ Clueless
[0:45:12] ikrstfu: is that a cat or a rat Hmm
[0:45:14] swankytiger942221: @scha_de lmao I know.
[0:45:14] Ziimms: checkpoints?
[0:45:15] CuppaT_XYZ: only if you pussy GIGACHAD
[0:45:17] enar_ixo: Just add different keys for different doors i guess
[0:45:26] jay_jaymann: yea makes sense
[0:45:27] manfreygordon: maybe there'll be secure storage you can unlock
[0:45:29] ELEGlGGLE: @Mandan0 at 1300 subs he said
[0:45:29] swankytiger942221: Okay yeah I get it. Yeah I agree
[0:45:38] ELEGlGGLE: mhm
[0:45:40] srirachawoah: yeah my thing is just robbing a strangers house isn’t cool to me, I want there to be some Rp behind it
[0:45:41] rjoconnor: You should only be allowed to take so much shit. Not wipe someone's house
[0:45:43] mariuspure: yeah the key shit is weird, I imagine if I was playing tarkov and my whole stash got wiped lmao I'd never play it again in my life
[0:45:53] reagon_plays: just like multiple doors in rust
[0:45:55] ikrstfu: 39 subs guys for sub goal DonkCredit check your prime
[0:46:01] srirachawoah: like conflict that leads up to it
[0:46:02] wolfhall113: @mariuspure Yeah I'd imagine it could make people quit, losing so much progress
[0:46:04] tim212_: I can already see it happening more people will hold up people and make them unlock
[0:46:04] yauwright: also code locks for important stuff is good idea
[0:46:05] epic_smee: Whats poppin playa
[0:46:07] luckerooni: the problem is people treat houses like warehouses so the loss risk is absolutely insane and theres little gray area in how dangerous it is
[0:46:09] swankytiger942221: Ming and them didn't take EVERYTHING tho I don't think. I think someone said that
[0:46:13] tim212_: people will also start making rust bases in the house
[0:46:16] reagon_plays: just like multiple doors and multiple bases across the maps in rust
[0:46:17] GoRibGo: money and opportunity is always a reason
[0:46:22] ikrstfu: "my rp is robbing the house, why would I want interaction" EZ
[0:46:31] Mandan0: @ELEGlGGLE TY
[0:46:40] zvidrvhim: A guard dog too
[0:46:43] manfreygordon: I had one as a kid and it was the MOST stressful shit ever LUL
[0:46:43] Pheyerus: Security cameras with live stream access from phone would be cool
[0:46:44] rikzoo: NODDERS gruppe6 secured houses
[0:46:46] RoddBlack: Cops would find a house full of weed KEKW
[0:46:46] srirachawoah: yeah or phone notifications
[0:46:48] mariuspure: yeah but people would get held up to enter the code also LUL
[0:46:49] Zardete: Maybe in houses in good neighborhoods
[0:46:50] Andr3wxy: code locks instead of keys
[0:46:54] tim212_: they could make it where you upgrade the system the better security you have
[0:47:00] DinoModzz: Coded door locks to strangers
[0:47:03] 911_raj: I think warehouse will more secure
[0:47:03] highrollergambler: or like a home security company like a branch of g6
[0:47:06] rikzoo: that might be tough
[0:47:07] Heiridum: then again they just point the gun and ask for the key and the code
[0:47:08] jay_jaymann: yea different levels of security for the house that you can achieve
[0:47:15] rjoconnor: Ring cams would be cool. So you can see who did it.
[0:47:27] luckerooni: or maybe if you go into a house using a key to open a door but you're not registered it automatically calls the police and is considered a robbery attempt
[0:47:31] DinoModzz: Should be a hack on the door if you got the key and not on the panel
[0:47:38] dislesiksnd: could implement hacks to access certain things like barrels and a fail locks them out of that container
[0:47:43] rikzoo: NODDERS
[0:47:44] Mantelrorelsen: When the alarm sets off...One single peron is loaded with computerparts and blueprints and taken off.
[0:47:45] etopplol: it might have
[0:47:48] tim212_: could be something like base level is calling cops the more you upgrade that system the better the response like guard dogs
[0:47:51] NemisizZ: cams
[0:47:53] zvidrvhim: Make it so that you have a choice to toggle the security system on/off on the panel
[0:47:54] ghutta: the problem with cops sent to the house would be that they'd ossibly see illegal shit no
[0:47:56] Sylverphyre: keypad lock would be cool
[0:47:59] highrollergambler: like a extra save or deposit box
[0:48:01] tmanftw: you can get motion sensors and cameras would be cool for group 6
[0:48:03] fublian: I think a Safe that stores a few things would be good for everyone to have. So you dont loose everything
[0:48:04] ikrstfu: one thing I knew, cops need to be involved in this type of things, without a player reporting it.
[0:48:04] jay_jaymann: yea maybe not allow access to the stashes and bench unless you are on the Pannel
[0:48:06] FISKAR: Saw some guys get robbed in there house yesterday 100k in few secounds
[0:48:14] epic_smee: The idea of keys is really good in general,but in this economy right now it's too devastating for a normal "House robbery" .
[0:48:17] Heiridum: pets for your house could be cool

[2:31:32] leafsprek: psychedelic drugs mostly effect brains in the same way so people see a lot of the same stuff
[2:31:46] leafsprek: hence DMT elves only happening with DMT Nerd
[2:31:48] WoodzCS: I see them after snaps

[2:32:52] divandesalon: it is schnaps it is german
[2:32:57] Mantelrorelsen: I read a study of a long time theraphy with the doctors infusing DMT directly with motorpumps t break the wall immediately and keep them there for a much much longer time.
[2:32:59] Marchski: Not necessarily most people expirence the same feelings when doing other rec drugs why wouldn't it not apply to psychedelics
[2:33:07] kebabrulle13: @woodzcs snaps
[2:33:07] zzZoolex: they're made out of it, as he describes it
[2:33:19] leafsprek: dmt elves basically geometric shapes that people say speak to them when they have a DMT "break through", when someone goes giga unconscious
[2:33:31] epic_smee: Wtf are you guys even talk about
[2:33:31] zzZoolex: other people have had it, but they most likely influence eachother
[2:33:32] WoodzCS: wait no Kebab is right, in Swedish its snaps Nidas

[2:36:45] FideICastro_: just take acid in your living room like an adult
[2:36:45] kebabrulle13: LSD was a hell of a ride i wonder how DMT is then
[2:36:48] leafsprek: DMT, Ayahhuasca, Acid are super prone to just breaking your brain. It's not rly "enlightenment" it just fucks your head
[2:36:51] FitzKeppet: incredible reasoning - I'm here for it
[2:36:51] emptycanns: is enlightenment worth being a crackhead

[2:37:24] gostonko: KEKLEO get a load of this guy with the ego over here
[2:37:25] Stord: that's your Ego talking
[2:37:27] epic_smee: LUL
[2:37:28] DopestKush: it’s mostly people afraid of death looking for answers
[2:37:31] Lizaard_King: bro chill with your ego bro
[2:37:32] CopperKat: ayahhuasca is heavyweight compared to normal psychedelics anyone who says otherwise is already brain cooked
[2:37:42] Byggsmurf: haha rust recycler
[2:37:43] Yusuke429: You need an ego. It is part of your self worth. Everything in moderation that is the key to life.
[2:37:45] epic_smee: They key panic is eveywhere
[2:37:51] FideICastro_: i’ve taken crazy amounts of acid and idek what ego is

[2:38:06] gostonko: fidel KEKW
[2:38:06] FideICastro_: i just like to get high
[2:38:14] Umage: ego death can help with addictions, it can show you why youre addicted to something
[2:38:15] gostonko: our resident florida man Gladge
[2:38:15] Mantelrorelsen: The Ayahuasca calls those in need.
[2:38:16] ViolenceOfDucks: it's not like it erases it forever
[2:38:17] icantremember3: Some do some dont
[2:38:18] SkaldFKACC: absolutely, and you can't not have one, factually. it's like saying 'I meditated so hard I no longer have body language'
[2:38:19] Lizaard_King: you definitely need an ego in life
[2:38:23] SkaldFKACC: it's a function of a brain
[2:38:28] leafsprek: yeah it's the same w/ people who use acid a lot, they spout 'benefits' and like, benefits of what? benefits of having your view of 'reality' heavily skewed cause you broke your brain? KEKW no ty
[2:38:29] Qamz: ego can get ppl stuck too. I thinks its those that need those trips. for catharsis.
[2:38:30] GoRibGo: I didnt find my ego death changed me much really
[2:38:33] timbres: Ego Andy over here
[2:38:33] divandesalon: say no to drugs kids 3Head

[2:39:21] leafsprek: YEP it's an experience, but not one everyone needs or should take
[2:39:22] icantremember3: Its the same with medicine
[2:39:24] WoodzCS: I found out where the elves are btw, its called Bohemian Grove
[2:39:26] SkaldFKACC: recreational enlightenment
[2:39:30] DopestKush: it’s all perspective based
[2:39:41] DopestKush: in terms of how it affects
[2:39:43] PaulJones: No one does DMT recreational
[2:39:43] ro666ert: it's beneficial for the tourism tho

[2:40:41] Diabless: timbres ❤️
[2:40:43] leafsprek: I think ayahuasca is actually just DMT tea @Nidas just acid turned up to 11
[2:40:46] epic_smee: I give keys one more week LUL or the system will get changed somehow
[2:40:48] smoglet: I think it can help enable detachment.. but detachment can in turn be detremental to things like empathy or social awareness..
[2:40:49] SkaldFKACC: iboga*
[2:40:56] Manu_95__: british ReallyMad
[2:40:58] GoRibGo: not often I start my day with talks about shadow people and trippin lol

[2:41:08] SkaldFKACC: like I'll consider you somewhat enlightened haha
[2:41:10] rjoconnor: You can drop acid wherever you want, you have to go to the fucking jungle to do ayahuasca, shits wild
[2:41:12] Byggsmurf: yeah keys seems to be a bad idea

[2:43:04] timbres: @diabless When is the true RPer of the house gonna get on the server

[2:45:41] timbres: I need to see Sasha as a lawyer
[2:46:02] epic_smee: Yeah civs will turn crims real fast with the keyrobberies. Just start blasting when someone rolls up LUL
[2:46:11] rjoconnor: I think crims robbing civs is kinda lame. There's no real rp from it
[2:46:26] gostonko: Hmm
[2:46:33] timbres: I think crime is bad
[2:46:36] AlexanderMichael: in all that time the person can hold down their house tho no?

[2:49:03] DopestKush: house admins Pog
[2:49:05] myvii_: it would be cool if you could have different locks on different doors in the house
[2:49:13] 0nix3: maybe changing existing keys should be cheap but new ones still expensive
[2:49:15] jay_jaymann: if everyone carries a dummy key with the high key price it may stop people cloning stolen keys

[2:49:37] noombus: Can you lock pick a house yet?
[2:49:37] NebelKop: all it takes is standing at a door with a knife to lose soo much...
[2:49:40] whaleownage: In an unlimited cap server, having a locksmith *civ* job would be interesting as well. Essentially changing your locks means leaking to a civilian where you live
[2:49:42] gurglet: wouldn't the robbers then just kidnap the person and force them to show the house and rob it immediately before locks can be changed?
[2:49:42] ELEGlGGLE: what if people just didnt rob random people??? 🤔
[2:49:43] man_bear_pig: dummy keys would be a funny af meme

[2:50:08] zvidrvhim: Key in snr buns box LUL
[2:50:10] totalusxox: what about not being able to rob things inside stashes/workbenchs, just wjhat is visible?
[2:50:22] man_bear_pig: key inside sr buns box
[2:50:22] quadity2: Allowing one code locked storage in a house would solve a lot of the issues I think
[2:50:29] StingR_OW: They copied so much from rust, how bout put a code door omE
[2:50:32] timbres: A neighborhood watch would help too, like houses on the same block sticking together
[2:50:38] epic_smee: Its also not just a house. "You need a House for everything thats valuable" "oh btw that can be cleaned and you get set to zero". Thats just a really rough setup to deal with
[2:50:39] CopperKat: @myvii_ there would need to be a limit on the number of unique interior locks though or people would make unrobbable fortresses
[2:50:40] the_nano_horseschlong: YEP
[2:50:42] scr4ppy__: I cant wait till you can setup cctv outside your perimiter so you can avoid housecamping

[2:51:05] NebelKop: its cool af but its way to ez to do
[2:51:08] mossad321: cant wait to see the rust bases people will build
[2:51:12] jay_jaymann: yep and that’s the conundrum
[2:51:39] NebelKop: fr
[2:51:50] CopperKat: I think if you could have 1 or 2 safes per house it’d help. Put blueprints inside when not using or hard cash.
[2:51:51] zzZoolex: houses should have pinpads
[2:52:00] Lizaard_King: I think if they do allow people to let them mold their new house key, then it would leave no other option then to door camp peoples houses
[2:52:01] Raccoonsteps: do you lose everything on the drive ?
[2:52:19] zvidrvhim: I think for now everyone should treat houses like 3.0 methlabs and be more careful going in and out of it
[2:52:22] man_bear_pig: imagine house lock becomes a hack, but you can only do when the owner is online. so it notifies you to defend. that could be fun
[2:52:23] mossad321: @Raccoonsteps if they steal the HDD yes
[2:52:31] jay_jaymann: saving yourself from door camping seems impossible
[2:52:33] rjoconnor: It would be cool if they put trap doors and stuff in so you could make sneaky rooms to hide stuff in
[2:52:33] gostonko: D:
[2:52:37] wakeupgethigh: imagine if they  add home insurance
[2:52:39] CopperKat: A safe with its own key could be an easy solution too for the really important shit

[2:54:32] ro666ert: i haven't eaten yet Sadge
[2:54:36] epic_smee: They should make it so, that the storage is available with a key. So you can steal it, actual furniture should not be available If you are not "checked" as resident of the house.
[2:54:37] Fishnet83: Cold food in the morning WeirdDude kinda weird

[2:54:58] meego0o: I eat pancakes for lunch
[2:55:02] man_bear_pig: I mean, I feel like robbing houses could be cool if its a direct conflict instead of sneaking in with a key.
[2:55:04] Raccoonsteps: @izzygus333 like fully inclose the important stuff and then to access it remove the wall ?

[2:57:50] leafsprek: and maybe a l96 idk
[2:57:57] Raccoonsteps: okay yeah that’s what I thought it’s power gaming
[2:58:06] senlash: like a shotgun trap NODDERS

[2:58:19] mossad321: what ray did with their house is pretty smart
[2:58:20] noombus: Yeah if you have to use mechanics to get past the wall i agree, but making it hidden i think is fine
[2:58:30] izzygus333: I’ve seen people make secret rooms but you don’t have to move items to get inside, I like them
[2:58:30] numb3r13: get the rust app that notify's you when you get raided LUL
[2:58:32] CopperKat: I wonder if people will make bait workbenches and hide the real one so they leave thinking they hit the lick
[2:58:33] ro666ert: cut up all the mattresses for cash
[2:58:36] 6all: everyones house gonna look like a rust base soon woohoo
[2:58:51] quadity2: I've already seen some phasing through walls tricks in houses
[2:58:55] man_bear_pig: @6all airlocks incoming KEKW
[2:58:58] mossad321: we just need to let devs cook
[2:58:58] leafsprek: I think Tony used to have a secret room in his house in 3.0 where you had to jump & ragdoll to get into it
[2:59:07] jay_jaymann: what about internal doors that lock with a different key
[2:59:09] timbres: Isn't having half a dozen campfires in your house as a trap kind of weird too though
[2:59:13] jojaha: wonder if the mayor can affect taxes. would be cool to make like shady deals
[2:59:23] zvidrvhim: They should make it so you have to manually lockpick the doors inside the houses. But then people will just start spamming doors LUL
[2:59:29] jay_jaymann: or internal doors that lock with being on the panel
[2:59:44] epic_smee: Isnt the easiest fix to make normal storage accessible with keys but you need to be allowed to move furniture and acces blueprints?
[2:59:55] CopperKat: Unique interior locks would need a hard limit or you’d quickly have impenetrable fortresses
[2:59:56] Gurch: leafsprek, that was just a secret door between his and some other room. Couldnt hide anything in there just take a shortcut to avoid people possibly
[3:00:06] dimzkey: which groups have the best progress right now?
[3:00:14] Abraca_Dave: robbing houses in fine as long as people actually rp and engage with eachother imo, investigate make deals threaten etc

[6:09:21] BaldScooter: that’s 5head
[6:09:24] GoutOfWar: maaaaan guber
[6:09:29] PicklesDippedInRanch: Like a gaming cafe
[6:09:31] PicklesDippedInRanch: sort of
[6:09:53] PicklesDippedInRanch: Just need key to use bench right
[6:09:56] harkolly: Ayo chat ive just had a job application approved to relocate from the UK to Canada 👀👀 has anyone ever done this, how expensive is Canada to live im kinda terrified for this opportunity but im a free man do i just take a leap of faith..
[6:10:26] PicklesDippedInRanch: @harkolly anywhere is better than the UK but jokes aside depends on the region - Canada is so large that different regions pay different taxes etc
[6:10:44] PicklesDippedInRanch: 5Head
[6:10:47] somebadtiming: true 5Head
[6:11:06] harkolly: @picklesdippedinranch yeah UK is falling apart i was on the HS2 works until the can
[6:11:06] numb3r13: its all about trust and access
[6:11:19] somebadtiming: access to a house is what people really need
[6:11:28] PicklesDippedInRanch: Yeah good concept just needs to iron out the details
[6:11:34] wadebyjamesjuh: AK would need more info about how butcoin works
[6:11:43] epic_smee: Isnt a trailer way too small for that
[6:11:45] 911_raj: @wadebyjamesjuh  +1
[6:11:47] senlash: the ideas guy 5Head
[6:12:19] PicklesDippedInRanch: Run it internet cafe style where you're providing the general accesibility and ease of doing it Hmm
[6:12:22] highrollergambler: Remote Desktop type beat
[6:12:33] harkolly: @picklesdippedinranch pay works out to be 40 Canadian dollars an hour is that good bad if you know
[6:12:55] numb3r13: whole ass server park in a house
[6:12:56] Gurch: Is there any laws for crypto yet?
[6:13:00] dantherapper: at that point you can just sell stuff people need instead if the space, so someone gives you materials you craft and take a bit of the top
[6:13:12] senlash: peepoConstruct
[6:13:15] PicklesDippedInRanch: @harkolly probably need to do your research on the finer details
[6:13:16] 911_raj: Renting a house maybe more efficient I think
[6:13:27] Xpatrol: renting bench
[6:13:28] ELEGlGGLE: then u camp the roof and rob them ezPancake
[6:13:30] epic_smee: Come with your mats and BPs
[6:13:30] Gurch: Bänkbussen
[6:13:37] 6all: cant they steal the blueprints?
[6:13:40] reagon_plays: yeah they can take their blueprints and materials to make stuff theri
[6:13:48] 911_raj: You rent a and setup you whole operation
[6:13:51] leafsprek: @gostonko Stare
[6:13:51] numb3r13: that would actually work
[6:13:52] BotDoris: grab some for himself?
[6:13:59] PicklesDippedInRanch: @6all they bring their own supplies
[6:14:00] noombus: You'd have to rent it to one person at a time and have someone check they didnt yoink blueprints each time
[6:14:04] mariuspure: but they would clone the key hehe
[6:14:08] epic_smee: Issue is you cant really Store Mats in your Appartment. At least not many
[6:14:17] 911_raj: That's also a valid point
[6:14:17] senlash: hehe
[6:14:29] reagon_plays: @mariuspure Oh that might be a isuue
[6:14:31] somebadtiming: you can have mini workbench
[6:14:34] PicklesDippedInRanch: Hmm unless you have a "Guard" that lets them in and out on call
[6:14:40] numb3r13: yes
[6:14:42] epic_smee: You provide mats as well maybe
[6:14:43] Dexeh: there is also crafting time
[6:14:45] meego0o: it would make sense if not almost everyone js friends wirh someone who knows someone who let u usenit anyways.. f.e yager using these guys bench
[6:14:52] pukuotukas666: You could steal peoples stuff and just ocean dump everyone. repeat.
[6:14:53] PicklesDippedInRanch: but then again need the key to even use
[6:14:57] PicklesDippedInRanch: Hmm
[6:14:58] numb3r13: and you would have to change all the locks every time someone stops paying
[6:15:01] somebadtiming: just a bench house is not gonna work
[6:15:10] nthnwoof: make sense if the house owner was the only one would could do anything key/lock related
[6:15:21] somebadtiming: too many people know people
[6:15:24] PhosphineGas: you can change the lock once a week also fyi
[6:15:28] reagon_plays: but if 1 person buys the key he gonna duplicate it
[6:15:35] mariuspure: I think single use keys would be a great idea maybe
[6:15:35] PicklesDippedInRanch: It's difficult because the idea is you don't know what they'll do in their free time with the key
[6:15:41] Kikobri_: ...and then make a pitfall where you make them pay extra to get out of the house
[6:15:59] senlash: nidasScheme
[6:16:04] Kikobri_: nidasEvil
[6:16:07] dantherapper: but then it's a one time thing, not a reoccurring payment, maybe 100$ to use the workbench you let them in once done if you need it again 100$
[6:16:22] StreamElements: Purchase Twitch Turbo to have an ad free experience! No ads, and you're helping the streamer https://www.twitch.tv/turbo LIMEPERS
[6:16:25] dantherapper: so you basically rent a pc or workbench
[6:16:29] mudgho: i mean a bench house could work if its bring your own blueprint
[6:16:29] epic_smee: You can have an insane amount of mats and a bench. People can Rent it and pay for your mats. You frisk them before they enter for a mold and then you give them the key
[6:16:42] Gurch: Renting "servers" that mine for you could work nidas cause then you can do crime with your own house with less risk
[6:16:52] epic_smee: True
[6:16:58] reagon_plays: these kinda systems would be very tough to work with if you can duplicate any key because to access the bench they need key and as soon as they get key then can duplicate it
[6:17:18] PicklesDippedInRanch: YEP
[6:17:20] somebadtiming: YEP
[6:17:21] reagon_plays: yea
[6:17:39] PicklesDippedInRanch: its the best idea with the less risk compared to the others
[6:17:40] senlash: peepoTalk MathTime
[6:17:41] 911_raj: Yup this one have potential
[6:17:41] jojaha: server idea might go to poop if the electricity/power is capped
[6:17:54] epic_smee: And you show nobody the house with the servers .
[6:17:55] somebadtiming: hopefully other house exclusive stuff comes
[6:18:04] senlash: !p2m

[6:21:31] PicklesDippedInRanch: only thing I can think of
[6:21:35] PicklesDippedInRanch: repair has to be more if its bigger
[6:21:42] Gurch: @epic_smee when esfandtv had them it seemed like bigger was for higher speed range. So big one increases top range acceleration
[6:23:15] yeslewd: plane turbo when
