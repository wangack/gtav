[8:35:23] DDolfo: But I agree it's different person to person
[8:35:27] sweetrefrain: I guess besides feeling sick the 2nd day the lymph node near my armpit also got swollen. So that wasn’t fun

[10:37:11] RickyHavok: Is there a definition for "Location" in there? LUL
[10:37:14] french_spies: @leightones Ehh, I think drawing the limit there is way too restrictive. It's not like if Saab would be told all about a drug operation he'd been investigating for 3 months
