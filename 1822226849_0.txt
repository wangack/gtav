[0:58:29] prasios225: @CenturyKingSM lol its a boot, but i thought the same at first
[0:58:31] 187juggernaut: yep, all breeds are the same, its the owners and how they are trained
[0:58:32] TheBigSteve31: People seem to want to make any moment a pitbull on emotions

[0:58:50] Taylojs1: My niece and husband have two awesome sweet pit bulls  they were raised right
[0:58:52] twofaced345gamer: Majority it is but some can naturally be like that
[0:58:56] Durtydoesit: It’s bad training which can be blamed on the owner
[0:58:57] ChunkySkidmark: had mine for 10 years. he a sweet boi
[0:58:59] Steffen7: Can happen yes
[0:58:59] johnnyblamz: I think every dog is different, and often depends how a dogs is raised. But sometimes dogs just real territorial
[0:59:03] mastershredder: kinda the same as having a bad ass lil kid. all about how they are reared
[0:59:03] macheight: I've been attacked by one. Very scary, latched on to my arm and it was impossible to get it off. Has unfortunately put me off pitbulls for life.

[0:59:11] notcoggers: Wowee wtf
[0:59:12] winroar: Those dogs can suffer from dog amnesia
[0:59:12] TheSouthpaw: the issue is you cant take Pit Bull owners as being good trainers at face value. like..."Oh my pit is super sweet he's well trained" when in reality, they just leave the pit bull out in the heat on a chain all day
[0:59:13] sammo84: Happens in humans too
[0:59:14] sadbag69: nah im sorry for any owner but i cant be around them
[0:59:14] Clarkerson: a kid was killed by their owner pitbull who they raised since puppies
[0:59:14] GSReptile: i feel like some dogs are a lot harder to train and require more work or attention or harder disipline when they are young but its also family constantyly havving them around people teaching them young
[0:59:16] BrookieCookie697: Some of them do snap randomly
[0:59:18] khash_tree: All I’ve only had pit bulls and got 3 kids never had a problem

[1:01:03] true_romancexoxo: id much rather have a pit bull come at me over like...a rottweiler or larger breed dog
[1:01:09] bigmacinpride: Most Pitbulls are friendly it depends on the owner
[1:01:12] true_romancexoxo: far more scary breeds than pit bulls
[1:01:14] Nabbyou: Andy - the best bread in the world?

[4:00:30] crystallovesbeannns: if you are going to fill out an application its a good idea to have clips of you doing rp as they ask if you have before

[4:01:07] freeandrewtatetopg: @crystallovesbeannns I never rp before
[4:01:41] freeandrewtatetopg: @crystallovesbeannns is it hard to do it
[4:01:46] crystallovesbeannns: even if you play in a public server just to get rp clips @freeandrewtatetopg . youll have a better chance getting in if you do its alot less likely if you dont have any rp experience
