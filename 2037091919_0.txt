[2:34:42] swankytiger942221: @erraticswami what I'm saying is that they might find something better than sani in like a week or so and switch to that. So over time it might not be that good. That's it. Rn it's great but 3k is still alot for a turbo for sani truck
[2:34:43] hoorvat: For some reason gives me borat vibes
[2:34:43] WoodzCS: What if it is actually Ola Conny? We cant confirm ist not

[2:50:34] swankytiger942221: Ohhh do you still think that's a good idea with people trying to save money for cheaper cars?
[2:50:38] LL_Cool_Tre: Penumbra was good choice because it is a cool looking car that will easily sell for more when it is sold out. Like righ tnow
[2:50:42] Tr3sk0: Is it the Volvo?

[2:57:15] searlesbarkleyk: Could buy a car, throw an ad in yellow pages that it will be sold to best offer in 10 days than make that money, rinse repeat
[2:57:36] Mantelrorelsen: Thats how to refine sweat into cash
[2:57:42] Mantelrorelsen: refine*
[2:57:59] swankytiger942221: @searlesbarkleyk yeah but it has to be the right one. When possible
[2:58:24] searlesbarkleyk: Yea you time the sale period to how long you think they restock
[2:58:30] Fishnet83: SWOONER Wee
[2:58:45] Terrozer: wait why cant you sell cars atm? just out of stock i guess?
[2:58:45] gurglet: rizzmore LuL

[2:59:06] mrbrabs: damn pinned meta warnings  maaaaan must be some juicy rp lately KEKW
[2:59:14] swankytiger942221: @searlesbarkleyk realistically you don't want them to restock it if it's a good car because them it's more valuable
[2:59:18] searlesbarkleyk: Yea but all good cars go outta stock

[3:00:22] searlesbarkleyk: My method isn't to maximize profit on a given car but to get good profit over and over

[3:16:41] Kossti: PepeLaugh
[3:16:42] swankytiger942221: Literally
[3:17:00] CopperKat: the working elevator blew my mind
[3:17:09] CopperKat: just the visual upgrades make 3.0 look ancient
[3:17:14] da5id_h: anyone can piece together the addons, but making it all actually work is a diff story
[3:17:15] rjoconnor: I think it's cool how they do it, it makes for interactions you wouldn't normally have
[3:17:16] CopperKat: walking into apartments and houses seamlessly
[3:17:18] mariuspure: the dynamic doors mhm
[3:17:20] bluoxxboi: Facts
[3:17:22] AloofMango: small immersive things
[3:17:30] Grob656: 👋👋Hello @Nidas
[3:17:31] JackLDN27: It's definitely "revived" my NoPixel enjoyment
[3:17:34] quickwiiddit: just passing items to each other or throwing items is craaaazy
[3:17:34] bluoxxboi: I been loving 4.0
[3:17:35] Kazeumi: i mean there was working elevators in 3.0 but foresure this one is alot better
[3:17:36] Brodoswagings: you dont tell me what to think about Madge but yea devs really been poping off!
[3:17:52] swankytiger942221: That's not even a ?
[3:18:02] bigchimpo: in a world where even AAA games are perpetually in beta, this is the dream
[3:18:05] KevYaaaDig: Apartments dont seem like a big deal but it is imo. Excited to see what is coming
[3:18:07] Xpatrol: Draider was talking about tehcnical stuff behind some new feature and its crazy
[3:18:07] CopperKat: the city itself is so immersive the mechanics are the frosting on a good cake
[3:18:13] TheOnlyRichaz: i love the depth of each job in NP.. i play on a server where sani is grab bags get % get paid $1000
[3:18:14] Fromac40n9: why cant we both be appreciative AND critical?
[3:18:16] swankytiger942221: Nopixal is just by far the best
[3:18:20] AloofMango: 3d modelled props that stays over tsunami is my fav so far
[3:18:29] scha_de: What makes 4.0 really great, in my opinion, is the quick adaption on thing and the "ever evolving world"
[3:18:49] ELEGlGGLE: bro would be doing garbage collection if it wasnt for nopixel AINTNOWAY
[3:18:50] Fromac40n9: i think the negative bias is there for sure, but people also focus on the negative too
[3:18:56] Kossti: Clueless
[3:19:00] Kazeumi: just minimize the teleporting is a big + i think
[3:19:09] LAaAMA_: it also gave alot of people jobs, and now they have grown into awesome content creators
[3:19:09] Tyler___24: only my mind?
[3:19:11] CopperKat: when lang threw like 3k on a roof and it was there like 2 days later
[3:19:24] OGeneralWillKill: most people don’t even appreciate the fact they woke up. That’s the ultimate blessing.
[3:19:30] swankytiger942221: I think the craziest thing is that things that you put on the ground and it's the actually item and not a box or something like that. It's nuts
[3:19:30] mariuspure: for me the in game house editor is the most insane shit ever
[3:19:31] Xpatrol: yeah brain adapt really quick
[3:19:38] CopperKat: yeah human adaptation is our strongest trait but it also means we acclimate to good things incredibly quickly too
[3:19:38] Fyeah: hey whats up
[3:19:52] BulletProofSwede: Real windows is my favourite
[3:20:06] amorton15: this guy still yappin???

[3:20:13] etopplol: it goes both ways, we also become ok with really bad shit
[3:20:20] AloofMango: Yeah like yesterday I was watching some clips on harry's channel and the old old 3.0 ui looks so unfamiliar now like I have never even seen that shit
[3:20:31] Formats: world moves quicker than ever

[3:20:58] rjoconnor: The ui format alone in 4.0 is fucking wild
[3:21:01] Headss: Does Nidas still work on nopixel?
[3:21:06] 9Rux: and 7 years later BOOM
[3:21:11] Tr3sk0: I never thought you would be able to have 200+ players at the same time. When i first watched nopixel it was only 32
[3:21:20] swankytiger942221: I can't wait for gta6 with this shit. mrbongLove mrbongLove mrbongLove mrbongLove

[3:22:07] p13row: this is a amazing product , its unbelievable
[3:22:21] SCOOPEDON: I think the reality is humanity expects improvement. so we don’t always appreciate it. we just expect it.
[3:22:22] swankytiger942221: I hope they get a bigger diversity of jobs soon
[3:22:22] AloofMango: @LL_Cool_Tre the one on old construction site? I am excited about it too
[3:22:25] sonsytuba: The most wild thing about the entire ecosystem is that there is a huge corporation at the top reaping so many benefits from the work you folks put into their game and they just... do nothing LUL
[3:22:26] generalchern: the city feels more alive in 4.0
[3:22:30] realitijd24: NODDERS
[3:22:31] Canahealz: last season pizza was a burger no its a pizza last season there was a jet pack so i can see this season being really good
[3:22:33] Fromac40n9: yeah i see a lot of people praising nopixel as much as i see the the hate. but overall, criticism can be more constructive and kind than it usually is
[3:22:34] Terr0rBytes: The fine line is when the content becomes finding the mechanics
