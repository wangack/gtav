[3:05:09] Lumidar_: premeditated
[3:05:12] Kevz95: but if at any time he tried to revoke consent / back out and wasn't allowed, it'd still be kidnapping Hmmm

[7:06:00] manilovewakesfeet: i dont understand the RP. slacks literally saw this guy with the masked man that made the hand gun and said boom at slacks.. 40 minutes before he was killed. how has slacks not put two and two together
[7:06:03] shanejo127: I heard it was Doug buck tbh

[7:07:29] danipyedc: Lawless
[7:07:36] buddha_hands: @manilovewakesfeet good question.. the obvious answer would be because it could make the CI clam up about any info & stop providing anything, but not sure
[7:07:38] dkakr: @angel_ofmercy yea blau doesn't really want his character to snitch names
[7:07:39] Jilqy_xo: wyd?

[8:00:28] HeavyMetalKittenx: @blavod she works with the mayor and is on the city council

[8:02:02] cherochero: The problem is Murphy purposely decided to have amnesia, which fucked his entire case up
[8:02:07] zeike_nz: Guns can be handed over...
[8:02:10] wavep987: Planting would be an easy solve if DNA can be traced from inventory, if the guns is placed it has the DNA of the planter.
[8:02:11] sonadapop: honestly thats more of a Malton/Crane/Nekoda thing to bring up
[8:02:12] walkgleesh: they passed  a ton of stuff, it was 4 hours long
[8:02:12] urkuri92: does she think PD didn't do this? LUL
[8:02:13] RoninGundam: if murphy had a better defense, i think they coulda had more doubt
[8:02:29] Blavod: true
[8:02:31] buddha_hands: casings+DNA+serials wouldnt have even helped murphy so there would have to be something else to clear him
[8:02:33] Krimson07_: watch  out she may take a LOA 😭
[8:02:33] Drkdream: Hmmm
[8:02:33] jollypnda: It isnt an easy thing to deal with
[8:02:33] lookingfornothinghere: yeah PD did the defense lawyers job by trying to find evidence to clear him but there wasnt any
[8:02:33] cjohno20: @cjohno20 I forgot about K. His is probably the most likely to be appealed LULW
[8:02:40] FNG_Josh: Bailey is Endgame!
[8:02:40] coldskarr: i dont think she gets the cops dont make the laws
[8:02:42] taraannee: this sounds like a gripe for the judge of the case who made the guilty verdict imo
[8:02:43] psicosmoker1979: in this case that law needs to dissapear
[8:02:47] Eddie1225: @coldskarr she knows
[8:02:51] Eddie1225: she used to be a cop lol
[8:02:56] knaveries: @RoninGundam with no DNA at the time the only way he'd be innocent was if there was video of a gun being planted
[8:02:58] chrisestes: k has a good appeal because he was gsr negative
[8:03:04] SmgQuest: @cjohno20 K's charges are already being appealed. not sure when the trial is though
[8:03:08] Drkdream: OMEGALAUGHING
[8:03:09] Eddie1225: yea thats the main thing
[8:03:15] Eddie1225: the defence fucked up at the end of the day
[8:03:23] DESHAWNTE: @chrisestes true
[8:03:29] x_Gordo: nothing will change until someone on the council gets a gun planted on them

[8:03:51] DESHAWNTE: @SmgQuest true I forgot about that ❤️
[8:03:52] buddha_hands: it also looks bad to basically KNOW it was phony/planted & press it anyway but what can ya do lol
[8:03:53] knaveries: Murphy Chris Benoit's a local and himself
[8:03:58] RubberMBH: i am gonna complain about something i know very little about hahaha
[8:03:58] Kawika219: she doesn't even know the facts, but is arguing the case lol
[8:04:03] Blavod: yeah
[8:04:03] Atomicor: Mr k got arrest for planted Gun?      Gsr Negative.@ the scene when he was shot
[8:04:04] Eddie1225: yea its a insane case when you actually look at it
[8:04:04] Eddie1225: OMEGALAUGHING
[8:04:05] walkgleesh: murphy didn't remember anything. I wouldn't  blame the lawyers
[8:04:09] Newname_5: @x_Gordo 100k fines and 1 day jail sentences with all the planting is going to be so good for the state LUL
[8:04:21] timedoggg: i think Juno is worried about her self. Supposedly she has been whispering in max ear about not giving nino a business license because he is associated with eve in the business. She has an axe to grind with eve
[8:04:28] dakota22446: @knaveries crazy ass sentence KEKL
[8:04:29] 04jetta: Amazing he can remember all this
[8:04:30] Eddie1225: @Atomicor sure but if he doesn't appeal it then things cant change
[8:04:32] Eddie1225: lmao
[8:04:43] cyan0sis: what is her role in the city?
[8:04:47] Atomicor: @Eddie1225 it is being Appealed.
[8:04:54] fergy123: hes appealing it
[8:04:56] slomojosh: chief of staff
[8:04:56] sonadapop: @timedoggg thats quite a leap
[8:04:57] cjohno20: I don't understand how there isn't a warrant for the other party in the mr. K situation. Either the gun was planted or there's a second gun
[8:04:59] refi3xy___: Shooter is the witness lol
[8:05:01] vasuba: @timedoggg certain cops talk too much as well
[8:05:04] Atomicor: Fled on bikes that were later found @ mosleys :-)
[8:05:14] sshineysean: @cyan0sis Dabs Chief of Staff

[8:05:31] SpartanRanger01: @redeyeisac23 i mean in terms of rp noone can prove that

[8:05:35] refi3xy___: @cjohno20  exactly
[8:05:36] DESHAWNTE: @redeyeisac23 👀
[8:05:38] Sanitet: changing constructive possession is crazy
[8:05:38] He_Who_Shall_Not_Be_Named: Hard to change constructive possession when the murphy case set precedent
[8:05:39] x_Gordo: @redeyeisac23 i mean why wouldnt they LUL
[8:05:40] SmgQuest: my question is for the K trial what can be done with casings. im not sure if it was implemented in yet.
[8:05:42] jasonquinn2022: yea the witness was from the other side too
[8:05:45] Sanitet: theres evidence now atleast
[8:05:47] zeike_nz: Changing constructive possession screws a lot of other things like drug trafficking in some situations
[8:05:50] Nerdversity: is she playing corrupt politician? cause like i mean gun on someone is gun on someone lol
[8:05:54] cXenoz: @redeyeisac23 its RP bro they can in character
[8:06:01] Atomicor: there was no dna,Casing to be considered used to shoot him w/? Correct?
[8:06:13] Drkdream: @SmgQuest it happened before
[8:06:13] sshineysean: @cyan0sis  which also makes her a council member

[8:06:36] sonadapop: @astathegoat420 ???\
[8:06:36] thewarth0g: pd gun is on them cos a cop got robbed in the first place cos they can’t apply lethal force with a gun when someone is brandishing a knife within 21 feet of
[8:06:37] GreenMonk: @astathegoat420 what is sitting like a female mean?
[8:06:37] taraannee: even a gun in possession and gsr negative doesnt prove innocence bc they could've stolen it & just not used it yet
[8:06:38] SmgQuest: @Drkdream thats what i thought so im curious if it just has to be ignored or an agreemnt or something.
[8:06:39] ShowHatez: @astathegoat420 ?
[8:06:41] SpartanRanger01: @redeyeisac23 bias spotted.
