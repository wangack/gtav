[3:45:58] meatlove69: 4Shrug  is 0.4
[3:45:58] noonedi: to push down someone strain you need to steel their weed and sell on yours, makes sence
[3:45:58] DrBakaDO: what caused you to drop from 58/60 to 28

[3:46:12] GAMANTAKA: stop trollin by telling him hes right
[3:46:12] GordonFreebase: also Lang could technically be over 100%, its like that with job rep where the real rep value is hidden, so you pushing 1% wont lower their rep below 100 because its actually much higher
[3:46:13] rbkelevra: Chat is delulu
[3:46:16] eepyslothy: after this now that both parts are gud then is it ok to ask them how and explaining?

[9:13:49] Captain_Chronic: replace
[9:13:52] natalieyep: @haw2991 LUL
[9:13:56] CURT_iS: so change all bushing TBH
[9:13:57] nykoretta: at 30k miles?
[9:13:58] babyluue: take it out
[9:13:59] Captain_Chronic: do both
[9:13:59] 420Complexity: you ideally want to do both together
[9:14:02] SupaHsuB: You have to refill the Blinker Fluid first
[9:14:03] LugoUchiha: you buy the car from wishlist kekw
[9:14:04] GlitchyByte: is it a freaking transformer?
[9:14:06] VictoriaKFC: both
[9:14:07] vjbranded: No you usually want to do both sides at the same time
[9:14:09] Èπ£‰∫åÂçÅÂÖ≠: Do both
[9:14:11] bagindawastaken: I might damage the other one no?
[9:14:11] Captain_Chronic: or other one rip
[9:14:12] rz_1988: it should be both
[9:14:13] rustico0716: Both
[9:14:14] MysticazZ: do both I think? it will be bad to the left
[9:14:14] endiiiio7: Both
[9:14:15] Captain_Chronic: do both
[9:14:16] OphidianFX: both at once need  to be aligned after
[9:14:17] Sicin1c: the entire control arm must be replaced
[9:14:18] sahaurang: both
[9:14:20] MysticazZ: ‚Ä¶
[9:14:21] Tobii: wtf did you buy
[9:14:21] masonmom02: Do both
[9:14:22] wilce5: Both
[9:14:22] MysticazZ: bro
[9:14:22] ragamuffen: both. that'll be $200
[9:14:23] m1kedrop: Both same time
[9:14:24] GAMANTAKA: @SupaHsuB i loled
[9:14:24] sk8mantra22: no if the ruber is gone it will break and cause more damage
[9:14:24] renthal666: it can b done seperate times
[9:14:25] xMike6: the mechanics are fuckin with ur car as they fix it feels like LULW
[9:14:29] Captain_Chronic: leave at shop
[9:14:30] StargateSGU: Oh you need new flux capacitor
[9:14:31] scotch319: cut off somebody's left arm then, I don't see the issue
[9:14:35] Purzeval014: change all
[9:14:36] bluewind5v: you can change one at a time..
[9:14:41] Fossabot: üî• The daily subgoal is at 200 subs.
[9:14:42] 420Complexity: NOPERS
[9:14:42] Purzeval014: because theyre both bad
[9:14:42] Sicin1c: no
[9:14:42] space_sheep_: U can change one side
[9:14:47] renthal666: u will b fine
[9:14:47] Captain_Chronic: u can
[9:14:47] nykoretta: isn‚Äôt it early for that at 30k miles tho?
[9:14:48] vjbranded: Reason for doing both is because they will have to do an alignment. So they will be doing it twice.
[9:14:49] MysticazZ: it will be bad to the left
[9:14:49] Sicin1c: you will be fuked
[9:14:51] xMike6: u can
[9:14:57] jay_jaymann: if you don‚Äôt do both it means you have to pay for wheel alignment 2 times
[9:14:57] renthal666: can do it one at a time
[9:14:57] OphidianFX: you could do one but have to pay for alignment twice cost you more
[9:14:58] sinful_desires: How long until new part
[9:15:00] bluewind5v: if you have one flat tire.. you don't need to all four wheels
[9:15:01] 420Complexity: its not the end of the world if you only do 1
[9:15:02] sk8mantra22: it will cause damage if the rubber is gone
[9:15:06] Captain_Chronic: but make sure u get the other ordered or u will forget
[9:15:07] zal_tais: you can, it‚Äôs just better to do both
[9:15:08] nykoretta: wow
[9:15:09] xMike6: okay then do it
[9:15:10] MysticazZ: you can if you drive softly but not reccomend
[9:15:10] Purzeval014: left will get worse faster if that makes sense
[9:15:12] VictoriaKFC: temporarily you can, but don‚Äôt drive too much
[9:15:13] StargateSGU: You need new bushings that are right handed
[9:15:14] zzjing: what's the rep now?
[9:15:16] Purzeval014: no rubber
[9:15:17] Janeway: get adam to push weed while u drive EZ
[9:15:17] DanielG510: one at a time is ok
[9:15:18] xMike6: just do it and get a realignment if needed @Lysium
[9:15:21] OphidianFX: do it then
[9:15:25] Sicin1c: Both sides have gone through the same number of miles and both are going to wear out at nearly the same time. If you replace only the one that has failed, you'll be back at the shop with it when the other one fails in a month or two.
[9:15:27] Vvvviinnccee: @zzjing 31
[9:15:27] SupaHsuB: i tght u got a new car?
[9:15:28] space_sheep_: Its fine, ez fix
[9:15:29] scotch319: are you sure you didn't buy a rustbucket
[9:15:29] Purzeval014: wouldnt recommend it
[9:15:33] Xpiral562: If you can get the left arm soon then it should be fine
[9:15:35] Captain_Chronic: u will forget
[9:15:35] Tobii: ask them if both sides are fucked
[9:15:36] m1kedrop: If it's temporary amount of time is fine, but labor twice, alignment twice
[9:15:37] viziila: Just dont drift with it
[9:15:42] Tobii: if only one is fucked, you're fine.
[9:15:43] endiiiio7: The other one would be fucked
[9:15:45] zzjing: @Vvvviinnccee SeemsGood
[9:15:45] CURT_iS: just means previous owner was whippin' donuts only 1 way lol
[9:15:47] jayhaych1: didnt you just get this car ?
[9:15:49] Captain_Chronic: u will forget is the biggest issue
[9:15:49] Sicin1c: you should be ok
[9:15:50] bluewind5v: I've changed one before.. a year ago .. still haven't changed the other no problem...
[9:15:51] solo_twt: Bushings out after 30,000 miles? That's odd
[9:15:54] 420Complexity: @Lysium you can do 1 then the other , the only reason you do both is so the wear is happening at the same rate
[9:15:54] MysticazZ: @tobii it is both bad and need replace
[9:15:55] shamanicsean: If you don't mind paying for it then do just one
[9:15:58] nykoretta: metal on metal if the bushing is gone in the meantime
[9:15:59] Purzeval014: so left still has rubber?
[9:16:01] iYeezuz: you‚Äôll be fine
[9:16:02] MysticazZ: @tobii but no stocks for left
[9:16:04] Captain_Chronic: buy a new car
[9:16:08] vjbranded: You will be fine. Coming from an owner of a mechanic shop
[9:16:08] jerm_56: Just use an advanced repair kit EZ
[9:16:09] Èπ£‰∫åÂçÅÂÖ≠: wait
[9:16:10] OphidianFX: one week is fine will wear your tires uneven
[9:16:12] lazyishyper: i would just wait, its only a week to make sure tis all good
[9:16:15] sk8mantra22: if the rubber is gone it will break and the tire will break off and mess your whole front in up
[9:16:15] Tobii: eeeeh.. just don't go offroad :^)
[9:16:17] Captain_Chronic: u should buy a new one
[9:16:21] SupaHsuB: 30k miles in Brunei?? How many loops did he do around the country?
[9:16:24] MysticazZ: @tobii that‚Äôs what I said..
[9:16:25] Sicin1c: by the time you get the other ur gonna have to replace the other again, if you drive it
[9:16:26] ferociousjuggler: What colour is it
