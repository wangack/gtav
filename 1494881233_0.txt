[1:38:44] michellephone: You need a skateboard
[1:39:07] sitdowndusty: @krooksoner210 to be fair cops use class 2's on whitelist also for breach or situations like that. only difference is this was caused by a rulebreak by that girl and cops shoulda let it slide
[1:39:21] jovana__jane: Yay!
[1:39:26] DestructvCrtcsm: yeah that's a good idea
[1:39:37] sitdowndusty: you missed a huge event on main server
