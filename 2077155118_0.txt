[3:24:24] PsychoBKilla: Yep people will just do their own thing
[3:24:28] rmcgowan: I think the one big thing left to change is to make Mosely's rep much more difficult to get. Right now people do other things knowing they can get their rep back in a few hours so they don't care
[3:24:30] MurphyDH: It's kinda like 'what's the point?'
[3:24:43] HotCocoaGamer: The rep stuff doesn't  really respect mechanic that much.
[3:24:48] Reiv_: RP server needs more defined roles... even if they come with strings attached, not just jack of all trades everywhere
[3:24:50] tigerland06: the lack of business support on top of it too
[3:24:55] aluckynewb: you get master mechanic rep in 2 hours KEKW

[3:25:43] triggerpoint007: At this point let them do it if they want to avoid rp then fuck it man it's just sadge tbh
[3:25:50] aluckynewb: i think the problem is you ger mechanic rep so fast you dont even care if you lose it
[3:25:51] HotCocoaGamer: You can become a master mechanic by just doing Mosley jobs without talking to anyone lol
[3:25:51] lascivious3d: They should just make repairing require 300 Rep since its not worth it to repair with less rep anyway and it would make it harder to balance with other jobs
[3:25:53] zenatr: @ThePitfallover Think the issue is that it's so damn easy to get mechanic rep back
[3:26:01] sarvmander: its like playing a game with cheats sucks the fun out of it
[3:26:04] FriskiestSpoon: the fact that people will actively avoid engaging with people on an RP server is wild
[3:26:06] TheFightspit: I don't like that it is end to just selling part with no mechanic business
[3:26:08] ThePitfallover: @zenatr but you lose a truckload of rep from other jobs
[3:26:12] zachps: Someone could go an entire day without Rping with anyone since they can do multiple jobs

[3:26:21] HotCocoaGamer: Meh it is what it is currently.

[3:36:41] ThePitfallover: just go up to 150 sets worth and see what happens nodd
[3:36:42] rmcgowan: And the current 100 set orders do have the advantage of being able to fit in a van
[3:36:45] L4zyb4ssturd: mats are much less likely to drop than go up in price
[3:36:52] SARcasm19: Yurrr

[3:40:08] Boltaction_Babe: Lang need to let Cloak help fulfill orders too hopefully Prayge
[3:40:08] rmcgowan: 100 set order used to last two days, now that doesn't work as well
[3:40:15] cuyliebear: You were kind of cash tight for a bit after the house purchase, if it is loosening up, then yeah bigger orders make sense
[3:40:18] eborcurean: @ELTanqu3 because he's not around
[3:40:21] ELTanqu3: just need to order more than what you already order
[3:40:23] Matrix8369: like a doubler order? how much would that cost?

[3:45:33] ELTanqu3: So what you saying is that streaming is harder than a real job peepoGiggles (I know some parts are and its a joke about hassan and those twitter farmers)
[3:45:35] RoyLeeTV: we'll stay in your head then :)
[3:45:41] AetherMana: You can talk to your mods :)
[3:45:42] eborcurean: there are some people who deliberately try and annoy, it happens.

[3:45:57] Grimmello: Exactly, chat may be your annoying younger sibling but you still love us
[3:46:02] DecayedmiNt: Twitch and youtube is 1000% harder
[3:46:08] Matrix8369: waking up with depression is already hard enough, having to also deal with chat, I cant even imagine.
[3:46:09] beienus: kyliebLove kyliebLove kyliebLove
[3:46:10] Tronno: Self employment in general is
[3:46:15] mugcostanza: it's running a whole business
[3:46:18] BlightSpeaker26: every job has its own struggles
[3:46:24] RoyLeeTV: we still see the calculator
[3:46:31] Khaza_: But a real job you have to show up to early in the morning every day. Can't sleep in or take days off.
[3:46:35] mugcostanza: kyliebCozylove
[3:46:36] RoyLeeTV: damn
[3:46:41] eborcurean: i earn silly money and it is less mental effort in my main job.
[3:46:54] NitroC3LL: streaming is sort of like freelancing guys.. imagine you having to do the job of the manager, the normal staff workers, the administration staff, logistics.. everything
[3:46:56] LeftyyOK: I'm here to just watch a quality streamer and decompress, me and the wife are going through it emotionally, she has to get life changing surgery monday, for her health, but that surgery means not having kids.  I gotta be her rock <3

[3:48:40] RoyLeeTV: that's too close to sleep time
[3:48:41] tigerland06: There are still plenty of good chases, its just the darn shift restriction
[3:48:46] mugcostanza: the shift restrictions are tough
[3:48:47] noKaminari: Will they not let you play EU? That's dumb.
[3:48:53] doccthunder: peepoHappy hellur people
[3:48:53] BladedBuzzer: was there any feasibility for a shift change or was that just a none starter?
[3:48:54] Hampasen: if you wanted to play letty from the start of your stream you would also have to play for like 18hours KEKW
[3:48:59] ThePitfallover: I really don't understand why you can't apply for a different shift instead of forcing you to quit
[3:49:05] eborcurean: it's been called out, curvy had a rant about it for the same reson
[3:49:12] FowlBirdman: oh fr? they should be encouraging time off duty lmfao
[3:49:13] prozorftw: YEP
[3:49:14] noKaminari: wow that's beyond dumb
[3:49:15] ThePitfallover: nodd
[3:49:17] eborcurean: yeah, you can't cross shifts
[3:49:24] FIunkifer: yeah EU or NA sucks both
[3:49:25] tedium7: nodd the rigid shift is very odd
[3:49:26] tigerland06: She'd have to get rehired as shift 1 and do most hours there, and slide into 2 for a bit.
[3:49:28] AetherMana: You say that, and other break that rule so much. There are shift two that log in 2 hours before storm and leave early
[3:49:31] Nohbob: Now, I am in queue.
[3:49:34] BladedBuzzer: oh just work whenever the fuck you want to type deal?
[3:49:36] noKaminari: Do they know cop rp isnt a real job?
[3:49:37] RoyLeeTV: is that something that might change in the future?
[3:49:37] cuyliebear: Yeah, you wanna be NA Shift and EU Shift.  I get it
[3:49:39] Achren: nodd
[3:49:39] gatsymphony00: I never got why they dont just split it by storm 2 shifts opens a lot more for people
[3:49:40] BlightSpeaker26: I'm surprised they are so picky with how many cops they have
[3:49:41] HotCocoaGamer: You would have to start in EU and hope they don't send you off duty in NA lol
[3:49:43] CptApples: applyapply for both shifts ezz
[3:49:47] mugcostanza: kyliebCozy
[3:49:49] tedium7: ASSEMBLE strimmer away
[3:49:57] rmcgowan: The existing structure does not work well for flex shift people. It's designed in such a way that some folks who don't fit into that exact mold can't work with, which is unfortunate
[3:49:59] eyesmak: yea I could see "do X amount of time on shift" potentially, but not being allowed to work outside it without penalty is dumb
[3:50:05] NitroC3LL: eatt
[3:50:18] Sahneee: yeah and knowing that they have low number of cops on duty is like maryReading
[3:50:23] neonishere32: welcome back
[3:50:27] NitroC3LL: danse
[3:50:28] Sonaro8: the shift thing is so silly to me with how strict it is AND having the on duty time requirement
[3:50:29] IO_Err0r: wb
[3:50:40] captaincameron: the pd don’t really have the luxury of enforcing shift restrictions right now when their numbers sucks
[3:50:41] cuyliebear: I would be frustrated with the shift structure too....there is a reason people get out of it as soon as they can IRL, I don't know why we are bringing it to fantasy roleplay.  But I am dummy :D
[3:50:41] jason_plays_games: jason_plays_games subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! oh hi there smile
[3:50:41] zachps: They should let part time cops flex their shifts

[3:52:48] AetherMana: The stairs scene anulPogA
[3:52:49] Syncrostrike: The fact that NP still insists on having 3 shifts split across 2 restarts boggles my mind! They could switch to a 6 shift system and let people pick one primary shift and a secondary one if they want.
[3:52:51] mugcostanza: it was a fun  movie
