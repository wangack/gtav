[9:38:06] wytechocolate650: exactly
[9:38:09] Hey_its_Mady: Yeah keep the downstairs a bit private from stranger eyes
[9:38:12] Sadisticmedic: Just Like old school mine craft mods
[9:38:56] ccoolracer128: they just store it in the trucks or sell it 1-2 bucks to the npc
[9:39:10] outsideinsiders: @hey_its_mady half the city already been down there
[9:39:17] ccoolracer128: it might be more now but thats what it was
[9:39:26] azmer1987: Do they charge property tax
[9:39:44] Poor_Scum: they need fix those stairs
[9:39:46] pmoonbuddy: All the stuff is going to be a pain in the butt once you have to transfer it all to that future 10,000 square-foot mansion in the hills
[9:40:08] PGMuNrOe: hopefully when they drop off the wood they dont steal stuff from the bench.
[9:40:11] Torrok: azmer1987 they introduced 20% tax on a lot of things, including house purchases
[9:40:19] Hey_its_Mady: @outsideinsiders thats true LUL
[9:40:20] bbotaa: Do people have to pay for utilities like power and water?
[9:40:22] toal2892: I'm still worried yall arent going to find renters myself. slacks would it just for the 'rp' but others.. the cost is pretty high
[9:41:08] pmoonbuddy: When do you think you will follow up with her on that??
[9:41:28] wytechocolate650: this is the perfect time for renters
[9:41:48] Hey_its_Mady: Yeah I think she'll approach first
[9:41:56] outsideinsiders: $5500 a week is nothing for a grinder that‚Äôs making 15-20k a day. just gotta find them
[9:42:14] Birnieee_: I haven't been watching  much crime roleplay but how does one attain blueprints ?
[9:42:20] Splitcookie713: Yea I think renters wouldn‚Äôt be an issue.
[9:42:36] azmer1987: 15-20 a day would have their own house i imagine
[9:42:51] WeAreDyingX: defeats the purpose of being on a roleplay server
[9:42:52] bbotaa: putting a target on your back lol
[9:42:55] LewieFX: Grind less, RP more
[9:43:02] RacefanRacing: yup

[9:43:09] Tsithik: they wont how much you have unless u tell them right
[9:43:15] nick_dr1ft: I mean the server clearly doesnt want you to do other things, but I agree yeah
[9:43:19] Torrok: if you can't make 5500 a week then you are not even trying, its like 3 jobs
[9:43:27] theonlyraidboss: thats an ick statement imo
[9:43:31] bbotaa: You can do both if you do it right
[9:43:34] toal2892: the jobs lead to the rp
[9:43:38] GuyWithTheEye: obviously I won‚Äôt say who but someone literally lost prio for only grinding
[9:43:39] Hey_its_Mady: Sometimes you have to grind to make some RP
[9:43:46] Splitcookie713: It‚Äôs tough to not work when things are meant to be expensive
[9:44:12] Canahealz: how do you get blue print and how do they work ?
[9:44:29] LimmieBasher: nopixel makes a grindy server, nopixel when people grind timmacNO
[9:44:52] Blizzie: does the 2nd computer already have a vpn ?
[9:44:57] Splitcookie713: all the people doing sani can post on yellow pages and half the city will contact them
[9:45:35] Azhogh: that rpg mentality?
[9:45:40] trisge: Lots of RP is locked behind progression -> people grind to open up possibilities ... suprise pikachu face
[9:45:48] bbotaa: @LimmieBasher that is not true at all i've seen many people that havent worked a day and made a lot of stuff happen
[9:45:51] DoctorFoxHead: Completionist ?
[9:46:10] LewieFX: Not leaving something hanging
[9:46:17] Azhogh: beating the last boss Hmm
[9:46:18] FolonRNG: sunken cost fallacy
[9:46:42] nick_dr1ft: @bbotaa yeah but the only reason people can do this, is due to them getting money from grinders
[9:46:45] Tsithik: I have similar problem and if i get stuck on something i waste a lot of time not moving on to something else
[9:47:01] Squidnapped: are you guys building this house?
[9:47:05] khalivos: humans are just wired to naturally value/seek progression and achievement
[9:47:25] DoctorFoxHead: presistent
[9:47:28] bbotaa: @nick_dr1ft depends what type of rp people want to do, deff money facilitates some rp other not so much

[9:48:13] Hey_its_Mady: 150 wood can fit in the wood mats section
[9:48:20] nick_dr1ft: @bbotaa have you seen any arc on 4.0 that isnt based or revolves around money, because i havent yet (understandably so)
[9:48:40] outsideinsiders: the the crew get the 2nd vpn up and running?
[9:48:45] outsideinsiders: did*
[9:49:03] bbotaa: @nick_dr1ft  yeah vivek eg come to mind particularly, the guy is totally broke and made a ton of stuff happen
[9:49:15] Splitcookie713: You can always rp having to work to pay bills but hating your job
[9:49:30] jta_lopes: guten morgen
[9:49:45] nick_dr1ft: @bbotaa yeah his main ark with bobby happened due to a money problem
[9:50:02] pmoonbuddy: danke sch√∂n
[9:50:30] nick_dr1ft: btw, I fully agree that the focus should be on RP, its just that things like the rep system, doesn't do anything to support it
[9:51:28] khalivos: Jack Wood Guy HUH
[9:51:29] azmer1987: Those who rp without current grind are beneficial of those who have been grinding. Scammers, ornideas to sell is only possible because of the money makers
[9:51:35] bbotaa: i'd argue most of it all happen without much... consideration to money but it's a very specific character also
[9:52:38] RacefanRacing: I cant lie the cul da sac is growing on me. Its got really good vibes
[9:52:44] azmer1987: People like vivek and Eugene only have money from grinders open to their rp scams or sales
[9:52:53] pmoonbuddy: Damn right, he sees that you are all in
