[2:23:10] retrowolf0498: Might have to move it to the middle?
[2:23:25] retrowolf0498: The chests I mean.
[2:23:29] QuesoCommander: that comes after I thought
[2:24:23] reboyo: that was 2.0 tessa?  for some reason I thought that was early 3.0 tessa moving the C4
[2:24:24] QuesoCommander: would be nice if there's was a little help/tutorial info on it
[2:24:45] Darth_hedgehog: Queso nakkiHuggie
[2:25:09] QuesoCommander: @Darth_hedgehog nakkiHug
[2:25:31] Landarokz: From what I understand, the rooms are just player spaces you create to put all the assets of your home into so they remain unloaded until you step into the space. You can make as many rooms as you want I think.
[2:26:35] jimothy64: Well, I'm still recovering from post-sickness exhaustion so imma dip, ciao o/
[2:26:37] QuesoCommander: can you clip through the wall and make it a big rectangle?
[2:27:11] QuesoCommander: @jimothy64 gnight! nakkiHug
[2:27:17] Landarokz: Maybe just two rectangle rooms to start and you can wall/door off the computer area later?
[2:27:23] StreamElements: Feel free to join my Discord flock, 5000 members and growing! https://discordapp.com/invite/nakkida
[2:28:43] nobodybodon: Could the room you're trying to make just be too big?
[2:30:36] ApocAFK: Maybe you need to unload and come back into the house
[2:30:50] Landarokz: You have to drag assets into that room now I believe from the builder tool or whatever
[2:30:55] QuesoCommander: not sure how it works with just one room
[2:31:20] QuesoCommander: based on the pre-launch demo, it looked like when you enter a zone it loads the adjacent ones
[2:31:31] nobodybodon: well it didn't help the lag spike KEKW
[2:32:26] nobodybodon: LOCKEDIN yes of course
[2:32:42] QuesoCommander: so if those are both "void" (unlinked?) they'll load immediately
[2:32:58] Landarokz: If you go to your asset list, you should be able to move the assets you want into the new room you created
[2:33:23] StreamElements: Secure your privacy with Surfshark! Enter coupon code Nakkida for an extra 3 months free at https://surfshark.deals/Nakkida
[2:33:28] QuesoCommander: oh really?
[2:33:52] Landarokz: Yeah, I've seen people have their rooms in that list
[2:34:02] Landarokz: And you can open up the rooms and see assets inside them
[2:34:17] Landarokz: But you have to manually move stuff into rooms
[2:34:24] Landarokz: So it can be a hassle but worth it
[2:34:36] QuesoCommander: ahhh, figured that's what the whole zone thing was for, but this makes it way more customizable
[2:36:02] nobodybodon: could you do it in a bigger square outside the walls?
[2:36:02] retrowolf0498: That makes it a pain a bit.
[2:36:19] nobodybodon: just include EVERYTHING in the basement
[2:36:26] nobodybodon: heck
[2:36:29] nobodybodon: frickin heck
[2:36:45] TheJRoller: Comp room and bench room?
[2:36:56] QuesoCommander: well the zone is just for triggering loading based on player location apparently, so you might only need a zone for the stairwell
[2:37:06] friendIykrueger: i go bed now, stay stinky chat
[2:37:10] friendIykrueger: Bedge
[2:37:12] QuesoCommander: and put everything in the basement in that zone
[2:37:47] reboyo: aaaah!!!  she's touching the internet!!!
[2:37:51] QuesoCommander: also BonkComcast ?
[2:38:16] QuesoCommander: audio is goog
[2:38:20] scott99901: Hai @Nakkida hai chat nakkiLove
[2:38:30] 80sHairMetalFan: BonkComcast
[2:38:37] QuesoCommander: zone = loading trigger
[2:38:52] Landarokz: It's all unloaded from outside
[2:38:55] Landarokz: No lag
[2:38:56] QuesoCommander: so you walk into stairwell = load basement before player gets there
[2:39:04] 80sHairMetalFan: @scott99901 nakkiHello nakkiFlower
[2:39:31] QuesoCommander: maybe slightly farther up so it has time to load before they enter, but yeah exactly
[2:39:51] TheJRoller: Might need it to define the loading zone?
[2:40:09] Landarokz: Even if you didn't do that, seeing everything load in in a half second after entering the room is pretty normal across the city lol. Nobody is too worried about the immersion.
[2:40:15] QuesoCommander: anything that isn't in line of sight can be loaded by a zone trigger before seeing it
[2:40:35] QuesoCommander: probably not nakkiShrug
[2:40:51] Landarokz: Everything in the green box, stays in the green box
[2:41:14] QuesoCommander: better questions for a dev
[2:42:42] Landarokz: Basically, more rooms is better and having lots of doors helps with the immersion of it all
[2:43:15] QuesoCommander: then maybe you have to have that stairwell zone linked to one in the basement as well so that it all stays?
[2:43:56] Landarokz: Not unless that loading zone is immediately next to the basement room
[2:44:00] eatcheese0: can you draw the box at the door?
[2:44:00] Landarokz: Right?
[2:44:01] QuesoCommander: I'm assuming everything in that zone and everything linked to it stay loaded
[2:44:37] TheJRoller: Just test it with your barrel
[2:44:42] QuesoCommander: you would need another zone linked to it
[2:45:21] ThatSoKyuRo: just break everything and go from scratch with rooms? Kappa
[2:45:26] QuesoCommander: DinkDonk Xee, elp
[2:45:30] Landarokz: I think these loading zone areas work like the zones from the Halo games. Gigantic rooms separated by tiny hallways (loading zones) with 2 doors either side of them. That's the best way to utilize them.

[2:51:01] QuesoCommander: see how many are in the list
[2:51:09] Landarokz: Don't worry. I've seen 2 streamers literally delete their entire homes over these room shenanigans. It can be undone lol
[2:51:38] QuesoCommander: that is a very worrisome thing to say nakkiLUL
[2:52:02] vipersummer: welp Tessa made boss and kicked out in the same day nakkiLUL
[2:52:55] QuesoCommander: well apparently it's somewhere?
[2:53:09] nobodybodon: No
[2:53:28] Landarokz: It could be some funny scuff where the rack ONLY loads in from your bedroom but obviously can't see it from there
[2:53:31] vintagegaze: at the top, it said creation and advanced creation?
[2:53:51] retrowolf0498: Did it get put in the furniture box by any chance?
[2:54:13] nobodybodon: it was still attatched to the computer, so its working even if you cant see it
[2:54:20] felipecuh: Your pockets?
[2:54:49] ThatSoKyuRo: can you go into dummy Tessa room?
[2:55:06] QuesoCommander: it was there before
[2:55:12] JoeayIV: it was there
[2:56:45] QuesoCommander: some old fashioned scuffery
[2:56:52] N7greebles: maybe its like that room from Harry Potter, where lost things end up
[2:57:35] QuesoCommander: that got replaced by that folder plant
[2:57:41] QuesoCommander: P L A N T
[2:58:20] Landarokz: Make sure to nap as a LAST RESORT, because you can still undo while awake
[2:58:29] Landarokz: Once you nap, can't fix anything without admins
[3:01:12] QuesoCommander: could try to run away again now after the undo
[3:03:52] QuesoCommander: ye
[3:03:54] JoeayIV: yes
[3:03:59] Chiracho: yep
[3:04:17] QuesoCommander: It was briefly in the list as unbuilt during the room scuff
[3:04:35] QuesoCommander: but also apparently it was still counting for the BUTC
[3:05:41] Landarokz: One of the devs is the room expert. Cid/Syd, not sure of name spelling

[3:12:56] CydRose: i would say try a nap, if its still the same then you might have to get a dev to roll it back for you
[3:13:07] CydRose: i know buddha had this same issue and i thought it was fixed
[3:13:16] CydRose: but he deleted his whole house
[3:13:33] Chiracho: oof

[3:14:08] CydRose: ill keep checking to see if i can notice anything else in the vod
[3:14:11] Landarokz: Just never, ever, ever, ever delete rooms. It ends badly. Think of rooms as permanent lol.
[3:14:51] ThatSoKyuRo: well for future start with building the rooms first?
[3:14:51] CydRose: ok i see
[3:14:58] Chiracho: Magic!
[3:14:59] QuesoCommander: nakkiPog
[3:15:05] Chiracho: KEKW
[3:15:06] CydRose: did that just get spawned on you lol
[3:15:15] QuesoCommander: was that a reimbursement or did that come from the furniture?
[3:15:18] CydRose: because
[3:15:28] CydRose: looking at the vod you should have one actually
[3:15:30] Chiracho: but does it have the gpu's? Kappa
[3:15:33] Makaveli079: when u click in the list on the racks, it showing left on the screen
[3:15:39] MinnRia: nakkiHm
[3:15:45] felipecuh: It was giving to you when you click x on the racks in the menu. Look back at your vod
[3:15:47] Chiracho: only one way to find out..
[3:15:59] Landarokz: Actually, yeah. I remember seeing something on the left side of the screen when you were in the builder. You DID get a rack.
[3:16:18] QuesoCommander: can you check the PC and see how many are connected now?
[3:16:29] CydRose: so you basically made a folder for your room, then while the list wasnt loading properly you put it inside that gpu rack, then you deleted the gpu rack
[3:16:39] CydRose: so there should be a rack either in your pocket or stash
[3:17:15] CydRose: it would have yeah :/
[3:17:23] nobodybodon: its backwards
[3:17:26] CydRose: but theres supposed to be a prompt
[3:17:32] CydRose: if you delete something with stuff inside it
[3:17:39] CydRose: so you can get them back most likely
[3:18:13] CydRose: sin will wanna know about the scuff so it doesnt happen to more people dw :)
[3:18:47] blah91: blah91 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 36 months! nakkiLove nakkiLove nakkiLove
[3:19:05] QuesoCommander: nakkiLove nakkiLove
[3:19:16] CydRose: ill send him the link to your vod so he can see the actual bug to fix, but you will need to get the gpus spawned back most likely
[3:19:59] QuesoCommander: you can compare the BUTC output from earlier to now and figure it out
[3:21:28] Landarokz: So 4 GPUs
[3:21:29] QuesoCommander: math saves the day nakkiEZ
[3:22:02] MinnRia: And now we breathe
[3:22:06] QuesoCommander: efficient!

[3:29:38] CydRose: thats possible
[3:29:55] CydRose: so you basically wanna create a room and make the boundaries of it just the basement
[3:30:44] Chiracho: section up the basement?
[3:30:48] CydRose: can you make it go past the walls
[3:30:53] Chiracho: storage area, computer area
[3:30:56] Chiracho: main area
[3:30:58] CydRose: so you're just making the whole basement  into a room
[3:32:14] CydRose: that storage lmao
[3:32:48] CydRose: perfect
[3:33:01] CydRose: yeah in the corner under the stairs

[3:33:53] CydRose: i think right click once
[3:34:05] CydRose: orrr
[3:34:07] CydRose: um
[3:34:10] CydRose: del?
[3:34:23] vipersummer: this where we lose everything?
[3:34:29] vipersummer: nakkiLUL
[3:34:37] MinnRia: the trauma is real
[3:34:38] Landarokz: And now we lost 5 more mining racks GG
[3:34:42] Landarokz: Kappa
[3:34:43] CydRose: haha
[3:35:21] CydRose: yeah so the point of the rooms, it doesnt have to exactly be the perfect shape of the room, it just means if the player is in those bounds it will spawn the stuff
[3:35:27] JoeayIV: bro
[3:35:30] DJayEnzyme: is that another rack missing?
[3:35:31] JoeayIV: was that another missing rack?

[3:37:18] Landarokz: Walls and floors you just leave out of rooms so they always stay loaded?
[3:37:22] CydRose: noice
[3:37:30] CydRose: @Landarokz correct
[3:37:39] CydRose: ok now check your placed list
[3:37:40] Landarokz: That's what I thought
[3:38:15] CydRose: why do they have to be built
[3:38:18] CydRose: thats weird
[3:39:07] CydRose: ok you can delete tessa room
[3:39:17] CydRose: theres nothing in it
[3:39:27] CydRose: or
[3:39:33] CydRose: thats fine
[3:39:36] CydRose: no its fine haha

[3:39:49] CydRose: i was gonna say if you're too scared its okay
[3:39:52] Chiracho: oh god.. did i just see another rack disappear?
[3:39:57] Chiracho: nakkiMeltdown
[3:40:04] retrowolf0498: Uhhh.
[3:40:05] MinnRia: pls stop breaking the strimmer nakkiLUL
[3:40:22] Chiracho: i thought after the first one she'd stop making rooms KEKW
[3:40:27] CydRose: go ahead and click the little blue hammers on the rooms
[3:40:35] CydRose: that will create them
[3:40:39] Chiracho: you need a test house lol
[3:40:40] CydRose: ohhh
[3:40:45] QuesoCommander: nakkiMeltdown
[3:40:48] Makaveli079: nakkiPhone Damien we gonna buy a new house
[3:40:49] CydRose: check basement
[3:40:50] nobodybodon: nakkiMeltdown
[3:40:54] Landarokz: That's the one that disappeared
[3:40:57] CydRose: i see the problem
[3:41:07] Landarokz: We got another scuff rack with missing GPUs
[3:41:13] macman385: this feels like a beta test
[3:41:14] CydRose: nah haha
[3:41:20] CydRose: its cause you have to build the rooms
[3:41:27] CydRose: and they dont show as folders until they are built
[3:41:46] Chiracho: so essentially take everything down and then build rooms from scratch?
[3:41:46] CydRose: its complicated basically
[3:41:52] CydRose: but you doing that shows use the problem
[3:41:55] CydRose: us*
[3:41:56] Landarokz: So there was a missing step no one knew. CRAP
[3:42:07] CydRose: so you have a mining rack on you?
[3:42:26] MajorPorky: wait is it a new mining rack that went poof?
[3:42:39] QuesoCommander: yeah how did that rack even get involved?
[3:42:46] Chiracho: @MajorPorky this is the second one KEKW
[3:42:51] CydRose: yeah see if you have a mining rack on you
[3:43:01] Chiracho: poor jay's gonna have a heart attack
[3:43:06] Landarokz: When she built the room, she got the rack
[3:43:09] CydRose: ok so thats the missing one
[3:43:22] CydRose: that is a big shame but
[3:43:40] CydRose: you can get the gpus back cause thats definitely scuff haha
[3:43:43] mgFray: well you know that rack was full at least.. :P
[3:44:13] Landarokz: The real question is why is a single rack getting poofed in the first place
[3:44:22] CydRose: and eat before tessa passes out, even though that seems appropriate rn haha
[3:44:31] Makaveli079: nakkiHappyClap
[3:44:45] CydRose: the rack dissapeared because  it was inside of an unbuilt room i think
[3:44:48] JoeayIV: no no
[3:44:51] JoeayIV: we all want her to die
[3:44:58] CydRose: LOL
[3:44:59] vipersummer: stop touching things
[3:45:04] MinnRia: just dont die in the basement
[3:45:22] CydRose: everything will be okayyy
[3:45:46] Landarokz: "So I lost another rack with all 6060s"
[3:45:51] CydRose: well i think now we can see the problem 100%
[3:46:14] QuesoCommander: Tessa's gonna be a can't hold all these GPUs meme as she empties them before decorating
[3:46:17] Landarokz: Rooms first, then put stiff in later
[3:46:21] Landarokz: stuff*
[3:46:22] CydRose: no so normally you make a room and can just put stuff in
[3:46:33] QuesoCommander: presumably it shouldn't scuff out in the first place
[3:46:39] ingridktravels: yes, remove all the GPUs and then you can move the rack
[3:46:46] CydRose: but when they added this little blue hammer, it made it so that you have to "build" the room after you make it
[3:47:08] CydRose: but you can still put stuff in a room that doesnt exist basically
[3:47:14] CydRose: causing the issue you had with the racks
[3:47:23] StreamElements: Feel free to join my Discord flock, 5000 members and growing! https://discordapp.com/invite/nakkida
[3:47:40] CydRose: yeah im not sure what happened with the second rack there actually
[3:47:45] CydRose: no theres nothing in it
[3:47:46] vipersummer: oh god here goes rack 3
[3:47:55] CydRose: if theres something in it, it will show as a folder
[3:47:58] AloofMango: foheadTHINKING

[4:04:58] CydRose: you should be fine as long as you make a room > build it (this might change soon so that they will auto build) > then drag in the furniture you want in the room into the room folder
[4:05:47] Landarokz: I think a smart practice would be to create rooms in empty spaces first. Then populate them after.
[4:05:51] CydRose: yeah that ill have to have a look at again
[4:05:56] Landarokz: Or at least have nothing in the space that has stuff inside it
[4:06:13] klaunns: try it out with malakai's room first?

[4:09:14] CydRose: they are fixing the bug where you can delete an item with stuff inside it
[4:09:25] QuesoCommander: nakkiPRAISE
[4:09:37] Landarokz: You could just drop everything on the ground, right? Place the storage stuff in room and then put stuff back?
