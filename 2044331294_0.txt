[3:22:45] AnonymousTrace_: Can’t really say I’m surprised too much tbf. ADMC members only have ill will towards Dee and the new iteration of BBMC. the connection between Dee & Barry is stuck to them only.
[3:22:49] Nomad_Ninja: Is it bad of me to wish for Barry to get Dundee'd out of ADMC, and for him to then come join BBMC again?

[3:26:40] AnonymousTrace_: @nomad_ninja not bad to want it, everyone wants RP stuff. I don’t think it would work longterm due to the history between them and that Barry has outrgrown being the VP or underboss to Dundee. Mostly just outgrown Dundee’s leadership in general.
