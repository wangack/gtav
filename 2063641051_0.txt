[5:54:35] LunacyAndPirates: yeah ADA work out the full list of charges and then hammer them
[5:54:43] Pymurin: @Raiighn that'd be manslaughter
[5:54:46] Neildmac: The oxy alone could have killed her
[5:55:03] Rinkimah: @Pymurin Manslaughter is killing someone without intent, I don't think attempted manslaughter is a thing
[5:55:10] SneakyTurt1e: Oh i know who that is
[5:55:12] cleese: what about mans laughter
[5:55:13] Kmehz: I mean if she was drugged would that count as deceiving her into leaving?

[5:59:44] LunacyAndPirates: it's actually interesting how closely all of these statements match, as eye witness statements are notoriously unreliable about getting and keep details straight across mulitple people and extended periods of tim e
[5:59:57] Raiighn: Poor cadet.
[6:00:26] acepps: @LunacyAndPirates i wonder if it's an extension of game knowledge and low stress
[6:00:42] acepps: cause it's not actual tramua it's easier to put together

[6:02:18] LunacyAndPirates: this is genuinely interesting to me having done a degree in criminology and psychology
[6:02:22] Rinkimah: @Pymurin How tf does that even work. Attempted implies intent but manslaughter requires there isn't intent
[6:02:31] cleese: blair witch flashbacks
[6:02:37] Raiighn: @Pymurin For when negligence just isn't severe enough for the level of stupidity I guess?
[6:02:43] notpatrickjrm: @Rinkimah you can intend to do something that wasnt intended to kill someone Shruge
[6:03:19] GrumFunk: this is what ADAs are for
[6:03:37] Pymurin: @Pymurin that'd be my guess, do something so stupid negligence isn't good enough, its 18 U.S. Code subsection 1113 apparently
[6:03:58] SneakyTurt1e: isnt it just reckless endagnrment?
[6:03:59] Pymurin: i don't know how to make the little s thingy :(
[6:03:59] notpatrickjrm: it would be reckless andangerment if that existed i think

[6:04:21] GrumFunk: deceit
[6:04:26] GrumFunk: they dressed as doctors
[6:04:52] Neildmac: If she had oxy in her system, so she would not be sound of mind
[6:04:56] Rinkimah: @Neildmac The whole point of cadet phase is to learn. Expecting them to automatically KNOW 10 codes is a bit much for a game
[6:05:04] LovesCatSweater: possession of government property
