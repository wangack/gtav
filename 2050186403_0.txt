[0:38:42] a_rx: PogTasty
[0:39:03] JuhJimmy: Adding a turbocharger to an engine will always lead to a net loss in fuel economy. While the turbocharger puts exhaust pressure to good use providing energy to help push air into the engine, the increased intake flow will always come at the expense of a greater restriction on exhaust flow.

One such device fell through the roof of the house in which Juliana and her owner lived. The dog is reported to have stood over the bomb and urinated on it, extinguishing the fire and preventing it from spreading. She was awarded her first Blue Cross medal for her actions. dizzTHINK
