[0:24:47] HypeBeast_Q: @Verafyed anyone but dashy .... its that simple
[0:24:47] 02tylerr: they are the only top 4 team that made a 2 person change they need time
[0:24:50] iirahmen: I feel like they just need more time people don’t realize it’s still major one
[0:24:51] Verafyed: selfless teams win chips!!
[0:24:51] Militia_Chilly: speaking facts zoomaaWtake

[0:25:19] JawnySinz: Faze up
[0:25:21] creamfilledf3m_b0y_420: OpTic has the highest ceiling of the top 4 but the lowest floor
[0:25:21] wolfxzz_: LAT was absolute dogshit in the first half of vanguard, and they dominated at the end of the year. Anything is possible
[0:25:21] ogralphhh: U said it perfectly habbits always hard to break
