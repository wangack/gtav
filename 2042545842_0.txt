[2:42:55] Ambi_Trigger: kekw
[2:42:56] StromkoPenguin: The combat feels like it wants you to use a controller, kinda Soulsy, but the rest of the game needs mouse and keyboard for all the functions
[2:43:21] Alucarrdx: which mice are you buying thats are $400
[2:43:34] Alucarrdx: it better come with extra features

[2:49:25] PrimordialCosmicHorror: @D4rkMiz3r From my understanding, the games usually 'remember' where the terrain was initially, and where it is now, and it constantly has to remember and compare both. And something about that is very intensive to do. I don't know why they don't just overwrite and forget the original terrain maps
[2:50:33] RobinHoodiess: @PrimordialCosmicHorror I'm guessing it is a shortcut to calculate stuctrural integrity
