There's so much viewer confusion about what they're doing. Koil hjas always said it's a "content" server over an RP server, but it seems like they're trying to change that with the way the PD's going... except the crims are continuing as usual?

[0:20:59] greyjulian: @kelborn I love the Ruth character, it’s just about 9 months too early for the server imo.  That arc damages a PD that’s too young to handle it.  so I struggle to see the though process too

[0:21:04] guilt_: The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee.

[1:19:00] BLazOR_Prime: cops in NP = 2nd life/ Real job/ PD Simulator/ NO FUN ALLOWED
[1:19:01] Athbreith: Its probably because of a looming Dap + Suspension + thing with Nekoda etc
[1:19:06] hammered850: Superman 64 re-release day too so that could be it
[1:19:06] steve_more: alt f4 - server just rebooted

[1:19:24] PupFamGaming: i think as long as your intent is to be a good cop then everything else should be less. i love the idea of RP punishment not just daps and suspensions
[1:19:24] Kelborn: @esfandtv have you had any OOC chat with Cheever about where you are taking your characters? I understand if you prefer not to say
[1:19:27] mutantzombie01: when Dean was ass chief in 3.0 he had people do armoury duty but the other high command got upset so he had to stop but carmine did it and he had an amazing hour
[1:19:28] the_anti_imperialist: cornwood can create content wherever and that is the most important

[1:19:48] CopperKat: the consequences should stay IN GAME not OOC
[1:19:49] supaiiii: mhm REDACTED
[1:19:49] fenrrs: roleplay, not simulator
[1:19:49] WeekendCQ: get suspended in game, so you have to work at sr buns for a week irl time and then have to reapply etc etc
[1:19:52] yaknow_itsjoe: RP=adult life

[1:19:58] Recon_XoX: RIPBOZO
[1:19:58] Vexamas: @EsfandTV Both sides, depending on bias are being very reductive. I've seen a lot of people boil it down to "Cornwood getting dabbed for doing his job"
[1:20:01] the_bucket_plays: oh no the cop hurt my feelings poor me
[1:20:01] GYNECHIATRIST: no consequences for HC atm Thinkge

[1:20:06] Bright_san: Any comment on maples stabbing?
[1:20:07] Kaztiell: @muller2526 he did something in rp so he can get punished in rp, whats so bad about that?
[1:20:09] Xen_Crypt: It feels kinda bad faith
[1:20:09] God_is_a_cat_girl: The way I see it is they are saying suspension/firing generates RP, but it's more like others deal with it and not them. If Cornwood had to do fire arms training again (rather than teaching) would be a good punishment, he would feel ashamed too but that's better RP
[1:20:10] Rebsdorf_TFT: Also it's a content server
[1:20:11] 1vivy: the PD command RP is the title line 'SERIOUS RP ONLY' you found on servers. it suuuucks

[1:20:44] WayILive: @esfandtv do think there’s any world where you would accept a suspension on cornwood

[1:23:30] roshamb09: PD def has the best RPers
[1:23:31] Boomling: what if ppl want realistic cop RP  as an escape from their sucky boring desk job and not reno 911 content for viewers? just trying to be devils advocate i think everyone shouild have your mindset but im biased cause im a viewer
[1:23:31] imSteffin: @SmugPls, dooming
[1:23:32] KumoKingTV: gotta lay down the law
[1:23:32] rizaus: Need a variety. Like crims have super serious, but then you have the clowns.
[1:23:33] toenipsbetripin: i loved ruths character at first a great contrast to the rest. It now seems to drag the other creativity to RP and makes people not want to be an officer.
[1:23:33] roshamb09: Ruth is an example
[1:23:35] Balir: Esfand for Pd HHC
[1:23:36] Lucid_Jaydee: @SmugPls Doom

[1:23:37] RoguePandaHD: Coke ramble
[1:23:39] mballin219: it has to be within the gta world not rl
[1:23:39] ManakinEU: @Landoram thats how they completely fucked the pd at the end of 3.0 and now they are running it back
[1:23:39] CopperKat: You should be an example of good RP not just good 'police work'
[1:23:40] TeaOnline: Alex Rivers SAJ
[1:23:40] s1owpoison: Ruth said you might get charged with manslaughter lol
[1:23:42] JO3Y_C: PD RP carries the server for the most part. Some of the best reside there and they just DAP them out
[1:23:45] zguy77: Slacks takes it to serious
[1:23:45] ZachFromChat: IRL cops dont get micromanaged like this LULW
[1:23:47] Xen_Crypt: Ripley was right Sadge

[1:23:48] viintu1: I love when Turner does hardline cop rp and Xice is just dying ooc
[1:23:48] J_Stomi: they want people doing pd like is a full paid job, but then go on 3-4h shifts as captains....
[1:23:48] itisacar: joey parmesean still in a coma
[1:23:49] ShadyMashX: The dap is one thing but Ruth was saying it should be a murder charge lmaooo
[1:23:50] kratoids: ruth has got to go
[1:23:51] cuspeli: Hmmge  ⬜ 🔺
[1:23:51] Aurkus: could someone rp as a robotic cop?
[1:23:52] shae__void: @s1owpoison oh my god KEKW

[1:23:59] StreamElements: 22% OFF YOUR PURCHASE AT GAMERSUPPS.GG when you use code "OTK"! NOW UNTIL 2/9! GET ON NOW, GIT!
[1:24:00] FIREMAGZZ: can someone explain what DAB is and why the RP is dead today?
[1:24:00] alyssa_ixchel: I mean, you hit the nail on the head yesterday - you're not real police officers, you're streamers and you're playing for content
[1:24:01] zac4e: Just join the clowns, Cornwood
[1:24:01] StormiNyan: cheever is such a good RPer but like Ruth is ruth xdd
[1:24:03] warnivea: Imagine SpacesBoy as a COP OMEGALAUGHING
[1:24:03] 1vivy: you can still have YOLO moments, but robot RP aint content agreed
[1:24:03] RaunchyOLDwoman: Cops are punished Worse than crims
[1:24:04] jessielight: criminal shoot cops and get minutes..cops run in hallways get dapped and it stays on for 45 days! this is yucked up
[1:24:05] DoomerDante: Mutelet rp?
[1:24:05] diguinnn: xpp
[1:24:06] God_is_a_cat_girl: rather than trying to prevent the end of 3.0 they should try to be more like early 3.0 which was FUN
[1:24:06] ManakinEU: @Xen_Crypt ripley is in a better now
[1:24:07] captain_steve_420: @EsfandTV Cheever disagrees with you completely
[1:24:07] woolfdesign: It's an ongoing show.
[1:24:08] aggiecreed: true
[1:24:08] bosschar95: they runing deans content
[1:24:09] Deflipside: Characters create good content
[1:24:09] KMGP_Outlaw: most value
[1:24:09] 404yak: lmao
[1:24:09] BerryG_333: Plenty of good RPers can to both
[1:24:11] driver1036: So if you police things you get daps but if you do nothing then criminals get God mode
[1:24:12] MuddaMoose: Ripley Sadge
[1:24:12] smith2244b: esfandExplaining
[1:24:14] dontdodrugskidsplz: go arrest someone bro
[1:24:15] Gachiguru: They want all the cops to follow SOPs to a T LULE
[1:24:17] monarchofmodesty: Is everyone on the server streamers?
[1:24:17] iii_governor_iii: the whole “don’t want a repeat of the failed PD” thing is stupid because that created amazing content in 3.0 @esfandtv
[1:24:17] SkywalkerCush: @samfields1 why type in rp terms you're in twitch chat LUL
[1:24:17] heavyd834: sounds like you need to have an ooc chat with ssaab and cheever
[1:24:20] Qolat: @EsfandTV You're gonna become a hot tub streamer?
[1:24:20] God_is_a_cat_girl: @warnivea he was a cop in 3.0 and he was funny
[1:24:20] KumoKingTV: for the quality
[1:24:20] Vexamas: @EsfandTV PD are the Dungeon Masters and Tone Setters of the server - sometimes that means that higher ups t hat want a specific tone can enforce that
[1:24:20] bosschar95: den had no job for over a week
[1:24:20] WildWillie419: The captains from the get go wanted a more serious PD than 3.0 - That’s why they don’t want the old chars.
[1:24:20] SavageTarzan: xdd
[1:24:21] guilt_: some streamers will make that impossible, just sayin
[1:24:22] kaexium: traffic stops should be rp checks mhm
[1:24:22] TakeAChance: @warnivea He has a cop character. Pat Downing
[1:24:23] CuBanMumzy: man wasn't around to see the shit show 3.0 became
[1:24:24] Joongi_: @MahanGM Mackenzie Hayes, Emma Dupont, Mathew Espinoz, all of them waiting to even have the chance to even try to get to the PD kekw
[1:24:24] slimmsherpa: go take it out on a local
[1:24:24] spicyville: cheever and Saab have both said you should not make IC decisions based on content
[1:24:26] truestoryguy: How dare you have a level-headed view!
[1:24:26] shae__void: where is Mr K, he and Cornwood needs to gang up
[1:24:26] Trigonda: Cornwood getting fired is content
[1:24:26] FIREMAGZZ: WHAT IS DAP
[1:24:27] SkaldFKACC: everyone has a different idea of what makes a good story too is the innate issue
[1:24:27] Jeremyohno: Madge No funny, only serious
[1:24:28] lawlkat: @EsfandTV you aren't thinking about it from the captains perspective. they are terrible at content. and all they know to do is "punishment is also content"
[1:24:28] Landoram: Cheever said it isn't a content server it needs to be serious
[1:24:28] xseaka: its a CRIMINAL content server apparently, no PD fun/content allowed
[1:24:29] Archangel3003: @boomling Then watch a cop that does more serious RP then. There are more cops than just Cornwood.
[1:24:29] WarSmithPaint: Cornwood heel turn when?
[1:24:29] Monksden: so discrad rules and laws set up for RP?
[1:24:30] RocketMcCoy: Denying Dead cop RP
[1:24:30] tyler__96: Deans content has been ruined the past 10 days imo
[1:24:30] bigpharmaa: essaying holy smokes
[1:24:30] MackPlays: PopNemo
[1:24:33] Kaztiell: but the content is boring if not rules behind it? else you can do same stuff on gta online
[1:24:34] enfranchise_: Ruth straight up said she makes calls based on RP and procedures and doesnt care about content or ooc
[1:24:34] Kalious78: esfandtv thinks hes getting daps when hes going down for murder and lying in reports .....
[1:24:35] RocketMcCoy: Dean*
[1:24:36] Hudman73: sometimes you gotta take one for the team to make the show fun
[1:24:36] TheKingOfWit: but that doesn't make me better than someone else
[1:24:36] chiefboof024: what is sbs?
[1:24:39] JO3Y_C: You need to have the Denzel Washington in Training Day Character.
[1:24:40] CopperKat: If your actions are 'against SOPs' but don't actually fuck anything up it shouldn't be a DAP.
[1:24:40] the_bucket_plays: honestly i think the captains need to communicate efficiantly or just perma and stay away from PD
[1:24:40] Deflipside: Sounds like a job at that point
[1:24:41] StormiNyan: time to take your frustrations out on the locals. fuck locals xdd
[1:24:41] Wintyer2: Yeah no real Defecnce on getting a Dap need a lawyer or union rep to defend you from getting DAP'd
[1:24:42] WildWillie419: I don’t think they take content over RP - not everyone streams
[1:24:42] danda1orian: @dontdodrugskidsplz he literally just got back in the server chill and enjoy the stream
[1:24:42] certtifiedg: hey sheriff , ur city is full of criminals
[1:24:43] enfranchise_: Not Ruth but Cheever I mean
[1:24:43] kalwin90: facts
[1:24:43] cuspeli: Bedge serious cops Bedge serious crims Bedge serious civs
[1:24:44] Reuschel: If there is no fun allowed, the server will die in terms of viewers.
[1:24:44] Voivid: with the lack of police officers do you think the crime scene can run rampant affecting the health of the server?
[1:24:45] Toluen090: This is a situation that should be handled ooc with the captains
[1:24:45] Janman88: its too restraining @EsfandTV
[1:24:45] icephrogg: They are saying punishment is also rp like u getting 5 daps is good rp
[1:24:46] DerLuvio: @warnivea spaceboy maybe wants to play his cop characer LUL
[1:24:46] woulf76: Is the inventory working?
[1:24:46] jd2881: Slacks seems to think there's a never ending list of possible hires. If that was true the main lobby would have people in there constantly looking for a job or word on application.
[1:24:47] Gachiguru: FAX mhm
[1:24:47] ToyLetTreat: nod
[1:24:48] supergaflen: but we cant have full dictator running the pd either Like Pred he wasnt running the pd for other his own benifit for himself heh
[1:24:49] havefunuall: get that in to the fat head of the captains "its an rp not real life"
[1:24:49] Sup3rU: i think you are the only cop
[1:24:49] quaylewastaken: Daps aren't rp
[1:24:49] PacGamer: It's a server direction problem being played out as "RP"
[1:24:49] Rebsdorf_TFT: BASED
[1:24:50] Hippleus: you can be fun without being funny and you can be serious without being boring but also yap
[1:24:50] Dautrat: SBS some bull shit lmao
[1:24:50] neowraithx: they need to make a rule limit of 1 dap per event
[1:24:50] Deleet: good cop rp is all about reading the room
[1:24:51] d_nl: chiefboof024 *shrug*
[1:24:51] StormiNyan: mhm
[1:24:51] MacVane: What did u do?
[1:24:52] Recon_XoX: @FIREMAGZZ DAP = Doing Actual Policework (Disciplinary Action Points)
[1:24:53] shae__void: @chiefboof024 stupid bullshit :)
[1:24:53] Mawkatz: @dontdodrugskidsplz he can't not allowed to anymore, or youll get suspended after being sued
[1:24:53] samaelulu: BASED facts
[1:24:54] chivvyy: while your stance is valid, it also sounds completely opposite to pd leadership
[1:24:55] CaptLaw44: what heppen i just arrive??
[1:24:55] Brisk_Avocado: mhm
[1:24:55] Lordrune13: No Dean on saekokPressF
[1:24:55] LogicWeasel: BASED  content is King baby
[1:24:56] aggixx: @FIREMAGZZ disciplinary action points
[1:24:56] RossTheBoss__: If they let you fully slide because it was a "one lifer" does that set a precedent? Although the punishment is way to severe at the same time
[1:24:56] Terrozer: @EsfandTV i agree but thats subjective, i think the reason for being too serious is in trying to make a very high stakes world to roleplay in
[1:24:57] SarahFlare: can’t make adoption fraud jokes
[1:24:57] neowraithx: max
[1:25:00] captain_steve_420: Cheever straight up said you shouldn't rp for your audience @EsfandTV
[1:25:01] RebornOffline: Cops can't be serious 100% of the time, it would ruin it for everyone interacting with cops
[1:25:02] Gachiguru: @MacVane https://i.imgur.com/WaDjH89.png
[1:25:03] kerndeezy: EZ decision
[1:25:03] kukballefaen07: Michael Scott Improv RP
[1:25:04] sKingNA: What thing
[1:25:04] warnivea: @TakeAChance that should be the goal of pd in 4.0 spaceboy as a cop
[1:25:05] bobbybeee: same as denzel/deano.. the mans beat.. can't be fun, entertaining.. nothing..
[1:25:06] brukk__: @EsfandTV  sadly it looks like they dont care about it and clearly stated on their streams that they want serious pd (ironicly)
[1:25:06] theJOATx: @EsfandTV if i wanted to watch real cop rp id watch an ep of cops
[1:25:06] cloudyfate: theres layers to this shit too cause a good rp character/good story  is how people put food on their table irl too
[1:25:07] Souqmadik: Cornwood is a fucking parody char too
[1:25:08] Quaggsly: chat what happened?
[1:25:08] StormiNyan: DAP Doing Actual Policework LOL
[1:25:08] bosschar95: @Landoram i heard her say that aswell, like people rp for content lol
[1:25:09] JakeStratic: You're chasing literal Clown Gangs, Rat People coming out of the sewers and living underground, and you imprison people for minutes for attempted murder... @EsfandTV . I don't understand how you can't have some great SBS moments in the PD.
[1:25:09] Doqx42: How many CRIMS are keeping tally of how many DAPs they have got handed out?
[1:25:10] Kaiyo_exe: \
[1:25:12] MahanGM: @Joongi_ it's like nopixel always has the most braindead policies LULW
[1:25:12] lightwarrior2088: imo a mostly RP driven PD is bad content for rest of server @EsfandTV
[1:25:12] im_so_strange: at the end of the day it’s just a game with the majority of players being streamers trying to make a living off of good content
[1:25:12] DoomerDante: When have you know humans to work together Kappa
[1:25:13] Joongi_: CAUSE STONE COLD SAID SO BASED
[1:25:13] TheOGWombat: couldn’t devils advocate say id cornwood is suspended its just rp and opens him for more story lines while suspended?
[1:25:14] lawlkat: @EsfandTV but Ruth's content is punishment. period. so she's going to abuse it
[1:25:14] Yoshi_Squad: because stone cold said so
[1:25:14] hellicross: coz stone cold said so
[1:25:16] Shankaze: I think a suspension is warranted to encourage police to atleast follow SOP's, but back on duty as soon as the suspension ends as if nothing happened
[1:25:16] d13vs13: Rhodes does good at walking the line between the two
[1:25:16] 1Tesla1: i was saying this weeks ago
[1:25:16] PeterPleb1992: and thats the bottom line, cos stone cold says so!
[1:25:17] BerryG_333: That's why this PD leadership needs help
[1:25:17] FIREMAGZZ: what is DAP?what is DAP?what is DAP?what is DAP?what is DAP?what is DAP?what is DAP?what is DAP?
[1:25:17] Vexamas: @lawlkat which, ironically enough, is also Esfand's stance. That's why he kept saying to Dean "play main as a civ, its great content" but he's too close to this to see it
[1:25:17] guilt_: stone cold 3:16
[1:25:17] madhatterui: slacks said there were too many officers that were present
[1:25:18] pinksparkly11: people got to remember its a game
[1:25:18] Thalamasca: Did I miss what they decided to do with that? :(
[1:25:19] jessielight: DAP (Destroys All Police)
[1:25:19] blanket4u: let the server evolve
[1:25:19] DrWetbone: @esfandtv I agree with you, I don’t think all players want entertainment. they just want to play as if this was reality.
[1:25:20] bigpharmaa: essaying holy smokes 󠀀
[1:25:20] HeyMeghan: also they need to not show favoritism in these DAPS. Cornwood got 3 daps for conduct unbecoming of an officer once and Duncan has done that TWICE now and both times only gotten 1 DAP. idk how they claim they’re fair when the proof is there plainly.
[1:25:20] LHaxorP: @EsfandTV, Deans 9 DAP cops version was so boring other than the inter play with other peopel about being at 9 DAPS
[1:25:21] Monksden: for you but as Captains, they cant shy away from that?
[1:25:21] neptunesstorms: nopixel is a streamer server true
[1:25:21] Lucsvm: at the end of the day is the captains that decide that
[1:25:21] grlgunk: everyone agrees with you, u can stand up to the captains and start a mutiny
[1:25:23] thechosenfeeder: i guess they believe it hurts the rep of the pd?
[1:25:23] POTRIPPER1: did Cornwood get a DAP?
[1:25:23] Jeeby: i feel like thats the biggest issue nopixel has, it has too much of a variety of people who want to play RP their way, and it impacts negatively with other players. for instance people who want serious RP, people who want to goof around, etc.
[1:25:23] kukballefaen07: Michael Scott Improv RP BASED
[1:25:24] 1vivy: hey if you want this kinda serious RP, cornball has good rep with city council to do some kinda takeover heh
[1:25:24] PacGamer: YEP Its roleplay YEP actions have consequences YEP my character has to react appropriately YEP i cant use ooc info YEP its funny but its rp
[1:25:25] chmod_R_777: it's like LSPD Command telling Officers to have no feelings and dont talk about it with other Officers... they want robots in RP too... its crazy
[1:25:25] MadderHatter: maybe when they had their issues with Pred, they chose to not make it a content server anymore.
[1:25:25] gadget_t: So why did other RPers report Cornwood IC for doing it?
[1:25:25] Smalls3122: AND THATS THE BOTTOM LINE CUZ CORNWOOD SAID SO
[1:25:25] kaexium: we need a state trooper to come in here and do some trooper shit
[1:25:27] Scully_18: I don’t like the way PD going. Keeps going this way it’s gonna be awful.
[1:25:27] SmugPls: 1-2 times running in the pd a week in 60 days = indefinate suspension BTW @esfandtv
[1:25:27] Badabooker: Cornwood is a hard cop now YEP
[1:25:28] CopperKat: @EsfandTV, Basically you're saying the SOPs should be there to encourage the best RP and not to mimic arbitrary 'IRL cop rules' mhm
[1:25:29] smith2244b: Clueless
[1:25:29] ToyLetTreat: @StormiNyan i been calling it Developing Another PD W
[1:25:32] quaylewastaken: Cause stone cold said sooo
[1:25:33] bazzzgg: Whats a dap chat
[1:25:33] MaNSoN6649: Dean had 4 k viewers lost to ruth good charachter
[1:25:33] cloudyfate: theres layers to this shit too cause a good rp character/good story  is how people put food on their table irl too. Cant have rp boners ruining that
[1:25:34] woolfdesign: I'm looking forward to Max's PD investigation
[1:25:35] gatsymphony00: because stone cold said so LUL
[1:25:35] FilzG: 5 daps tho...
[1:25:36] JayRomero: did cornwood get dap'd?
[1:25:36] StormiNyan: @toylettreat LOL
[1:25:37] PentaGoblin: clip for the DAP in question chat?
[1:25:37] JO3Y_C: You've never done that before and KNEW it was a one lifer.. Have to include that in thought process.
[1:25:38] VincentsDeath: if Cornwood said he missed, thats why he shot 25times do you thing he would still get a dap?
[1:25:38] Lucsvm: at the end of the day is the captains that decide that 󠀀
[1:25:39] TakeAChance: @warnivea He probably will once the Sheriff's office opens up
[1:25:40] Kelborn: The longer this goes without having OOC talks with the people involved, the more out of hand and less fun its going to get
[1:25:40] greywind2000: The captains seem to only care about the RP being serious and boring
[1:25:40] Vexamas: It's logical to dap cornwood, you're arguing its illogical to dap esfand
[1:25:40] BattleAlpaca: 5 dap is the prob, 1 dap for each thing wouldnt be insane
[1:25:41] secretaryofstreaming: I missed it . . . what di you get dapped for?
[1:25:41] Kalious78: its fine just get a job at mosleys for a few days so you can do you own car @esfandtv
[1:25:41] ViolentAkuma: Even Brock quit yesterday. Way to strict for alot of things.
[1:25:43] jmangaman: did they tell cornwood yet?
[1:25:43] zac4e: It fucking sucks to watch aswell
[1:25:44] sKingNA: Wait what is he talking about?
[1:25:44] ExpedientMiner: Adopt the Super Trooper model. A series state police and a goofy county/highway patrol. Too bad no one wants to be the first to cause division
[1:25:44] soosmaz74: u did well im proud
[1:25:46] AndHaka54: at this point i dont think they care
[1:25:46] kreloril777: teh captains arnt getting it lol
[1:25:46] brandon___kc: If i was Andrews, I wouldn't even want to login anymore
[1:25:47] Reuschel: Their problem is that if it goes unpunished that other officers will think it's okay to magdump and shoot "one more for Baas". It makes sense but it's lame from a content PoV.
[1:25:47] bertacharm: The one for baas prob deserves one dap tho tbh
[1:25:48] RebornOffline: He was gonna die no matter what happened, he was playing a no lifer for a reason
[1:25:48] ZachFromChat: I think they just disagree
[1:25:49] Qolat: I missed it, what're we salty about?
[1:25:49] candyluls: mhm
[1:25:50] SeaOfEmpty: My biggest issue is it seems like she is targeting streamers. The larger ones at that. If she is the only cop streamer, her views go up. She gets rewarded IRL. Makes more money.
[1:25:50] KMGP_Outlaw: @EsfandTV this also happened like 10 days ago
[1:25:50] CaptLaw44: cornwood get fire he is not a vigilenty
[1:25:52] Gachiguru: They want serious RP but they are not even good at serious RP @EsfandTV
[1:25:52] WayILive: so are they just supposed to pretend it didn’t happen
[1:25:54] WildWillie419: Doing the most interesting thing at all times isn’t role play
[1:25:56] Qolat: Oh, that still?
[1:25:58] bigg504: did LENNY get dapped
[1:25:58] random_viewer_55: @secretaryofstreaming he didn't get daped yet he might though
[1:26:01] 404yak: you sound like a teacher
[1:26:01] SouthPaw1724: AINTNOWAY
[1:26:03] SteveAdeptus: Turner is the perfect example of how to do serious in a funny way.
[1:26:03] DanielSauces: But Mr Esfand... what if your fun is wrong :)
[1:26:04] blahder: I think some punishment makes sense but the punishment needs to be a meme
[1:26:05] 1manpizza: pepeLaugh real life PD repercussions
[1:26:05] DrWetbone: Not all players share your mindset

[1:26:07] Jurgen___: @ViolentAkuma who's brock, is that the streamer or his character name?
[1:26:07] HallusH: deadass no point RP as cop  could just make non stop 1 lifers and pepega around for more content
[1:26:08] Scully_18: Some people playing it as a PD simulator. it’s meant to be fun.
[1:26:08] bigpharmaa: mag dump me
[1:26:08] leviathan297: modCheck cops?
[1:26:08] Souqmadik: Wow is this really about that??

[1:26:09] AtomicAtrox: I came in late.  What happened?  He get dap ?
[1:26:10] FilzG: BASED

[1:26:12] DoomerDante: Lack of sleep repercussion
[1:26:13] dreggy69: yeah if you get dapped for sbsing dens sbs character, thats gonna be a doggywater decision by leadership
[1:26:13] PeterPleb1992: i  think they are just trying to get rid of cornwood because his vision of police work doesnt align with theirs
[1:26:14] 55Hoes: @esfandtv would you play Civ Cornwood if you got Suspended??
[1:26:15] RebornOffline: Gave him a worthy death
[1:26:15] WildWillie419: Then why is NVL a rule at all?
[1:26:16] MahanGM: nopixel has always had braindead policies since 2.0 LULW
[1:26:17] Reuschel: Everyone OOC thinks the situation was hilarious
[1:26:17] ZachFromChat: Classic  police policing police
[1:26:18] keslo914: cancel culture
[1:26:20] TheGodmother: pepeW
[1:26:21] EWDijkstra: the problem is it looks like some people are taking their character's job more seriously than their character - the straight man in a joke is still in on the joke, even if his role is to act stupefied/serious in the moment
[1:26:21] Recon_XoX: They are targeting all the people who want to join LASO it feels like
[1:26:21] GnolRevilo: TRUE
[1:26:22] God_is_a_cat_girl: DAPs generate forced RP which is lazy, a proper punishment generates RP but also requires the other party to put effort into it
[1:26:22] yaknow_itsjoe: True
[1:26:22] RobRoads: Some people are taking this RP wayy to seriously. This is a CONTENT server on Twitch lol
[1:26:23] IAmSolari: @SeaOfEmpty thats a reach man dont be weird
[1:26:23] StormiNyan: which is there income
[1:26:23] PezusChrist: in real life if that scenario happening, the other cops would've protected you from punishment
[1:26:24] enfranchise_: Right, the punishment does not fit the action
[1:26:24] StarSquatch: weird ass take
[1:26:24] diguinnn: yeah...

[1:26:25] HagFaerie: 100% !!!!
[1:26:25] GoofyMaskedGoober: yup
[1:26:25] neptunesstorms: true
[1:26:25] docshaayy: Watching crims do the same tactics every day and stall and complain about being mistreated or trying to play the victim once they are caught, just for them to get away in the end gets boring and frustrating to watch
[1:26:25] havefunuall: its a video game jesus
[1:26:26] Spired12: just too bad the other cops on that scene felt otherwise
[1:26:27] CopperKat: Consequences should stay in RP not OOC.
[1:26:27] jeblowmi: well saab disagrees with all those points btw
[1:26:27] entvidya: real life repercussions: dean streams like 2 days out of 7 because of denzel's daps
[1:26:28] GoofyMaskedGoober: dean got fucked
[1:26:28] Fozenoh: BASED
[1:26:29] Rebsdorf_TFT: it's insane

[1:26:31] Lucsvm: @EsfandTV you know is a one life character, cornwood dont 󠀀
[1:26:31] BerryG_333: Knight can't be trusted
[1:26:31] virtus: It also causes people to hesitate and second guess their RP, and that's one of the worst parts imo.
[1:26:31] lawlkat: @Vexamas well the difference is, den logged in as a civ to try and get unsuspended and immediately got robbed. and no captains spoke with him. the captains basically just ruin RP for everyone else
[1:26:32] shae__void: TRUUUUU
[1:26:32] StepOnAHen_: peepoTalk
[1:26:32] Pravolution: @EsfandTV Any DAPS from pitting the car into the civ last night?
[1:26:33] Elky3: boys will be boys let em play couch
[1:26:34] toenipsbetripin: Sounds like someone we all know huh
[1:26:35] owlx7: Denzel..
[1:26:35] puppietreats: ruth & the majority of shift 1 needs a single hour of processing in the cells with bobby charles, james randal, chatterbox, osvaldo, the littlemens, ramee, and jean paul.
[1:26:35] CaptLaw44: what did cornwood did?
[1:26:36] chmod_R_777: LSPD Command in 4.0 = Internal Affairs... HOW ABOUT THE CRIMINALS??? sad
[1:26:36] Clabberlang: You're talking about Bonnie?
[1:26:36] 95eagles: BASED
[1:26:36] MackPlays: Firing an officer character is killing them
[1:26:36] wildarrow88: It's fine 700 PD applications. The whole force could be fired and it would be fine right? tinysLul
[1:26:36] Scully_18: This is massively effecting Dean
[1:26:37] Cujodk: if you want robot cops use npcs
[1:26:37] diguinnn: 100%
[1:26:37] bpkamenov: this is the issue I have with the suspension of Johnson and DenZel but the praise for Ruth....
[1:26:37] MrPRINCE______: agreed
[1:26:37] yaknow_itsjoe: @StarSquatch its true?
[1:26:38] quaylewastaken: Denzel isn't on again today
[1:26:38] Lord_Legolas: if Cornwood gets suspended, just take out all the turbos from cars and PD will die EZ
[1:26:38] Thesense: 100%
[1:26:38] kratoids: the only content ruth has is punishing people
[1:26:38] Waterbottels: @EsfandTV you're describing the PD clique, theyve been like this for years
[1:26:39] Creep_score: FACTS
[1:26:39] Flying_Floor: @EsfandTV Talk to Captns OOC maybe?
[1:26:39] bosschar95: Dean stream has had a big hit from no PD content
[1:26:39] zac4e: It should have been adressed OOC week ago
[1:26:40] NoBananaSuits: Yeaaa i thought about this with Dean :/ he seems to be doing well though
[1:26:40] Mawkatz: @jeblowmi not surprised
[1:26:40] Boomling: wow i didnt think of it that way. ya thats messed up
[1:26:40] PacGamer: @Jurgen___ Kylie's 4.0 cop I think
[1:26:40] karaskyee: doing more damage then good
[1:26:40] izzygus333: dean got did dirty
[1:26:41] smith2244b: LMAOOOOOOOOOO
[1:26:41] owlx7: Sadge Den zel
[1:26:41] HazyHung: there are rules for a reason. you just don’t like daps because you’re close to losing your job
[1:26:41] pinksparkly11: it should all be kept in game irl repercussions are dumbn
[1:26:42] Janman88: i get the suspension and higher stakes approach sounds good in theory on paper @EsfandTV but it isnt doing well played out and thats a fact
[1:26:44] icephrogg: They are also dapping cornwood for the brian knight situation so 6 daps
[1:26:44] lawlkat: @EsfandTV I think Saab has lost his mind.
[1:26:44] jasoncoffeemarlow: where is everybody in game
[1:26:44] PanicAtNabisco: Preach
[1:26:45] itscyber_ex: PREACHHHHH BROTHER CLEETUS
[1:26:45] newtricksterx: just go do a PI arc
[1:26:47] random_viewer_55: Cornwood would have a lot of viewers as a civ too
[1:26:48] owlx7: Sadge Denzell
[1:26:48] LogicWeasel: They're gatekeeping cop content to be boring and restrained.  @EsfandTV
[1:26:48] garowan: It feels like they force your rp
[1:26:48] Lord_Legolas: Free Denzel!
[1:26:48] KMGP_Outlaw: people just gotta use some common sense here
[1:26:49] neptunesstorms: I think thats why johnson fought for his job at first
[1:26:50] d13vs13: DAP punishments just need to be ones where you don't have to stop playing the character
[1:26:50] bobbybeee: JUSRTICE FOR DONALD BUSH... jk
[1:26:50] mrs_strawberryy: ssaab said he doesn't care how it affects streams
[1:26:50] 95eagles: Sadge den
[1:26:51] tyler__96: FREE DEN ZEL
[1:26:52] Slosiar88: like dean...
[1:26:52] Wort3xx: JUST MAKE A NEW COP CHARA RIGHT?!?!
[1:26:52] Wintyer2: Cornwood takes esfand to a 10k andy
[1:26:53] SeaOfEmpty: IAmSolari it's not a reach. Her viewership is 4x what it was.
[1:26:54] TeaOnline: why would they RP depending on OOC reasons?
[1:26:54] GYNECHIATRIST: bunch of FASCISTS in HC i tell ya hwut KKonaW
[1:26:54] 404yak: get a separate server then.  seems unfair to tell people who pay the same amount that they can't do what they want?
[1:26:54] funkywizard937: Sadge Denzel
[1:26:54] Joongi_: @MahanGM Is not even NoPixel, is the PD, idk why these people DESIRING to be in there don't have a chance to even try to get in the PD and then High Command is crying because there's not enough cops to do other things kekw
[1:26:55] Xen_Crypt: Like give corn a 24 or a psych eval or something, DAP system should create content not stop it
[1:26:55] blanket4u: rules effect irl money
[1:26:55] woolfdesign: 100% true
[1:26:55] MustacheWins: what happened? Did Cornwood get DAP'd?
[1:26:56] InsomniaHitsHard: @HazyHung BAIT
[1:26:56] CowWizardMoneyGang: @HazyHung he broke no rules
[1:26:58] LSPXI: Cornwood not cop is going to be good don't worry
[1:26:58] CeIoron: by that logic murder should be legal itl
[1:26:58] KippaChaos: Maybe its time for some new captains lol
[1:26:58] JustinBeaver_: Needs to be some consequences tho
[1:26:58] squamdip: The income argument is wild though. Because then crims shouldn't be put in jail because that impacts their view count and their income
[1:26:59] DayStreaminDavey: Slacks argument to chat was you can't disobey the rules set in place as a police officer just because it's a one life character.
[1:26:59] MahanGM: removing denzel, not hiring dupont = great content OKEY
[1:27:00] slothparty: do the players ever get together and talk about this stuff ooc?
[1:27:01] leviathan297: I still think Den playing off duty could be really interesting
[1:27:01] PacGamer: @mrs_strawberryy Ego
[1:27:01] Qolat: @EsfandTV You have a ooc meeting recently?  Maybe you guys need to have another to get shit figured out a bit better.
[1:27:02] NoGrave: Cornwood Parkour
[1:27:03] docshaayy: once they are caught, just for them to get away in the end gets boring and frustrating to watch
[1:27:03] Hawaiianbreado: do you have ooc discussions with ruth about this?
[1:27:03] MalsieGalsie: @hazyhung you’re taking this way too seriously bud. it’s not that deep.
[1:27:03] warner05: THE CONSEQUENCES DONT JUSTIFY THE MEANS.  PERIOD.  END OF STORY.  @esfandtv
[1:27:04] God_is_a_cat_girl: @EsfandTV Ruth literally hit another officer in crossfire and her excuse was that it was the bullet's punchthrough at fault LULW
[1:27:05] Kelborn: @EsfandTV people keep sayin Ssaab disagrees etc etc, idk if thats true, but its obvious there needs to be some OOC talk so get on the same page
[1:27:05] 55Hoes: hey Reddit
[1:27:07] JO3Y_C: Power Hungry RP Captains arent reasonable.
[1:27:08] Kevie70: Dean needs to be let back SAJ
[1:27:08] epicforeva: think you’re taking it a little too far, just because then you can say you should never give dals because it can ruin their real life
[1:27:09] CeIoron: by that logic murder should be legal irl
[1:27:09] izzygus333: server getting hit hard
[1:27:10] sunding88: its rather volatile to hide behind that shild called "it affects my income" cause. thats something the person should have in mind when doing their RP if that have such a huge impact tbh.
[1:27:10] Naruto_AMV_from_2007: did cornwood get more daps or something?
[1:27:10] Mawkatz: There is no dispatch anymore. she left
[1:27:10] reydedark: you make it seem like shooting 20 times IC even after ppl told you to stop was unavoidable
[1:27:11] 1vivy: its funny how cornwood has so much leverage but its not his style
[1:27:12] polesreport: o7
[1:27:13] Souqmadik: Thats not an excuse tbh if its effecting everyone else Ruth is still in the wrong imo

[1:27:18] Kaztiell: cornwood could have gotten murder by doin that, daps are not that bad compared to that xd @EsfandTV
[1:27:18] enfranchise_: Cheever literally did earlier on stream, she said she doesnt make decisions based on ooc or someones stream viability

[1:27:19] itisacar: congratulations: you now live here standing in that spot
[1:27:20] Matcha0515: yea happens
[1:27:20] TheKRT: @EsfandTV it was for entertainment, free content and laughs with dean's one lifer, shouldnt be penalized for that
[1:27:20] mechoriet: YEP Its Giga fucked
[1:27:20] ebos22: Once again 2 Captains have said IRL doesn't matter....and there are 400 people you could be replaced with

[1:28:15] SavageTarzan: Classic chatters that go xd
[1:28:16] hushbang: "ARE YOU NOT Entertained"
[1:28:16] D00Dlles: How dare he magdump someone who was downing cops with a knife
[1:28:16] BLazOR_Prime: If the care that much about one =lifers, they should punish every cop for shooting LOCALS then
[1:28:16] Gachiguru: sstvNPC ACTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES sstvNPC ACTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES sstvNPC ACTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES sstvNPC ACTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES sstvNPC ACTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES sstvNPC ACTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES sstvNPC ACTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES sstvNPC ACTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES

[1:28:19] papadooskie: people don't realize that this isn't real life lmao
[1:28:19] CopperKat: AN RP SERVER DOESN'T EXIST TO RECREATE IRL POLICE IN GTA - ITS A SERVER WHERE EVERYONE PLAYS MAKE BELIEVE FOR FUN. DUMBASS CHAT.
[1:28:20] enfranchise_: The captains dont see it that my dude, sadly @EsfandTV
[1:28:20] imgafski: @EsfandTV Listen some people dont get it, I believe doing stuff that maybe isnt 'by the rules/law' would make for great content
[1:28:20] jahim_: did cornwood god dap or susspended?
[1:28:21] 95eagles: Donald Bush the 23rd o7
[1:28:21] Lordrune13: The admins don't care
[1:28:22] djanik31: you getting suspended can be entertaining, go on your Trump arc
[1:28:22] spicyville: Saab and chever 100% do not believe that content is the main purpose
[1:28:22] im_so_strange: I don’t know how it’s possible for everybody to not have this same mindset
[1:28:23] comrade_raptor: lmfao yeah its a fucking game dude these guys need to remove their heads from their own asses
[1:28:23] Reuschel: It should have been fun for the 30 seconds that it took place but now it's a whole ordeal.
[1:28:23] EyelessJim: Captain NoFunAllowed
[1:28:23] Janman88: u cant entertain with that much of a restricting ruleset @EsfandTV
[1:28:23] sirsalem13: Ruth Alt
[1:28:23] the_bucket_plays: chat stop being weird
[1:28:24] mechoriet: D: you say this is all scripted now, what da heck D:
[1:28:24] Souqmadik: They are ignoring the context
[1:28:24] neft39157: His characters mane was like Johnson the 23.
[1:28:25] ZuldeadTV: they actually do
[1:28:25] SoggyM0uth: OMG ITS NOT REAL LIFE????
[1:28:25] Perterter: @EsfandTV Sounds like some people don't have the same view of the server as you
[1:28:25] n0oxaskek: Madge my immersion is gone now
[1:28:26] yaknow_itsjoe: @Gachiguru stop KEKW
[1:28:26] Shankaze: I think a suspension is warranted to encourage police to atleast follow SOP's, but back on duty as soon as the suspension ends as if nothing happened
[1:28:26] McKibbo: it was for an entertainment perspective, but its being taken as a serious scenario
[1:28:26] cabelgurung: Is there an internal affairs officer RP that hassles cornwood?
[1:28:26] WildWillie419: But the captains are having fun with their RP, what about them?
[1:28:27] DI4RMO: What is daps?

[1:28:28] Smoogol: BASED AND ONE MORE FOR SAM BAAS BASED AND ONE MORE FOR SAM BAAS BASED AND ONE MORE FOR SAM BAAS BASED AND ONE MORE FOR SAM BAAS
[1:28:29] WTFimnothere: People have killed one life characters before and not gotten charged murder lol. They usually get lesser charges
[1:28:29] Gigass: its clash between content rp vs strict rp like
[1:28:29] Kelborn: @EsfandTV have you had OOC chats over the punishment systems etc? At this point I feel like its necessary
[1:28:30] InquisitorDex: Why the hell do viewers care this much?
[1:28:30] IanDooleyTV: they 100% do. lol
[1:28:31] RobRoads: @esfandtv This is a content server powered by Twitch viewership. Captians are following RP a little to much to be honest
[1:28:31] BIake1: captains play a character also
[1:28:31] Janman88: oh saab knows very well
[1:28:31] Scully_18: funny how they don’t care about his last one lifer who died in the lobby on their watch

[1:28:34] 300ducks: ssaab for sure knows what good RP is
[1:28:34] CowWizardMoneyGang: and that stabbing was clearly a joking manner with the way he was talking
[1:28:34] Monksden: So its not ONLY RP then? LOL make up your mind wtf?
[1:28:35] c0denameHipp0: So am I in the minority by saying I'd watch you play another char.  just as much as Cornwood if you got suspended? Becasue to me idc what char. you're on I watch for YOUR content @EsfandTV
[1:28:36] MadaAkusto: RP VIEWERS TRY NOT TO BE CRINGE CHALLENGE (THEY FAILED)
[1:28:36] the_anti_imperialist: no one would want to watch report writing RP
[1:28:36] imgafski: you dont make content, you as a streamer wont get viewers
[1:28:37] zac4e: They do, they are just not letting it affect RP
[1:28:37] PeterPanTheKing: they dont want happend in 3.0

[1:28:41] ek1cs: NO SHE ISNT OMEGALUL
[1:28:41] Kelborn: bruh fuck me idk why I even try lmao
[1:28:41] slight621: Ruth was on stream earlier saying that it's not a content server at all
[1:28:41] ZuldeadTV: and the point is, they kinda give them reason to believe that ngl
[1:28:41] TheKingOfWit: It really seems that way too a lot of viewers, at some people it's just true
[1:28:42] IanDooleyTV: ruth is fantastic man.
[1:28:42] smbsocal: Over the years a lot of issues from PD have come from not having standards though.
[1:28:42] greenburg22: she wants u for murder
[1:28:42] gadget_t: It's RP. RP is the content
[1:28:42] hushbang: guzuBonk guzuBonk guzuBonk
[1:28:43] jburke23: Bro this is entertainment why do people act so serious about the shit that happens in RP
[1:28:43] Neekapkilla: You are right Esfand they do understand it, and yet they are still doing it. Very frustrating lol
[1:28:43] MahanGM: COPEFAND
[1:28:43] Waterbottels: @EsfandTV we think that because theyve been like this for 5 years
[1:28:44] thorstentomhuen: Does anyone have a clip of deans pov of Thatcher?
[1:28:44] SwitchBord001: Cheever is doing it and she does not care.
[1:28:44] neft39157: He had the 23 as he's last name
[1:28:44] Vexamas: @EsfandTV I think the problem is your view of the story is your view - someone else may say **your** story is also going to a civ life for a couple days - just like you said to Den when he got suspended.
[1:28:44] Smoogol: BASED AND ONE MORE FOR SAM BAAS BASED AND ONE MORE FOR SAM BAAS BASED AND ONE MORE FOR SAM BAAS BASED AND ONE MORE FOR SAM BAAS  󠀀
[1:28:44] 1manpizza: Chat the captains have been doing RP content for like a decade at this point, they understand OMEGALAUGHING
[1:28:44] bigpharmaa: Classic 0.4
[1:28:45] ZachFromChat: They straight up just disagree though, saab addressed that EXACT point. he said its a slippery slope and in character decisions have consequences
[1:28:45] DonnieDarkoTheD: People are just taking it all to serious
[1:28:45] djSimSi: @EsfandTV Dean got ocean dumped on that character too but decided that it was too boring
[1:28:45] FilzG: charged of murder is what Ruth is saying
[1:28:46] neptunesstorms: ssaab knows for sure
[1:28:46] atwitchusername4me: Cheever "It's a RP server first"
[1:28:46] jeffrey778: what part of content server dont the chat understand
[1:28:46] puppietreats: holy fucking shit chat
[1:28:47] seksmuhchine: chatters gonna chat
[1:28:48] MacVane: Then why is there an issue when the daps of they don't get it
[1:28:48] Jeeby: @EsfandTV do you think people wont play 1 lifers as much after this?
[1:28:48] Smalls3122: @EsfandTV its Ruth not all the captains
[1:28:49] wildarrow88: Nope only crims are allowed to SBS
[1:28:49] Yunus1903: @lawlkat you're being so ignorant
[1:28:49] kingslayer04570: how come we get called stupid every day
[1:28:49] 55Hoes: this is real Kappa
[1:28:49] KippaChaos: Its true if they are directing the narrative in another direction other than content...
[1:28:50] SmugPls: 1-2 times running in the pd in 60 days = indefinste suspensioj LUP @esfandtv
[1:28:50] Jrey000: yea she is good but Ruth character does not understand LULW
[1:28:50] PsychoJoker: They do they are arguing they dont want 3.0 to happen LUL
[1:28:50] TheGodmother: Please no pepeW
[1:28:50] slothparty: you should talk to them
[1:28:50] lawlkat: @EsfandTV her idea of content is punishment. period. that's bad
[1:28:51] itsRickus: Dean was actually annoyed that he couldn't get killed fast enough lmao
[1:28:51] Historyk: Is there no OOC talk (discord call) to speak about these issues ?
[1:28:51] thepromonkey1: Talk to them?
[1:28:52] cdarx2: but with how DAPs work currently, it is true
[1:28:52] LogicWeasel: Then why haven't ssaab and cheever FIXED the DAP system yet?? @EsfandTV
[1:28:53] LSPXI: Your RP is not dead when you're going to be a CIV esfand
[1:28:53] sabadios: Why allow SBS characters if you can't react to them in any fun way without getting punished?
[1:28:53] IanDooleyTV: they are. truly.
[1:28:54] humanhere2: Some people just enjoy immersion RP...
[1:28:55] random_viewer_55: If Cornwood gets fired RP doesn't end. You can still RP as civ. Or as vigilante Cornwood. It will be hilarious
[1:28:55] lawlkat: @Yunus1903 why
[1:28:55] GrooveSnack: You should have heard her on stream today
[1:28:56] tyler__96: Den Zel should never have been dapped for that PIT situation either
[1:28:56] theurbanhitman: Ssaabb is like... one of the most GOATed RPers
[1:28:56] Gachiguru: aint no way
[1:28:56] Doqx42: If COPs TV Show was a 24/7 following it wouldn't be watched, it's edited for entertainment for a reason
[1:28:56] SeaOfEmpty: The streamers make the server. Without them, it dies. Targeting streamers is targeting the server.
[1:28:57] WildWillie419: And now they want to be serious shrug
[1:28:57] laaazylemon: cheever literally said it ooc, she will not care for viewer loss !!!
[1:28:57] RoguePandaHD: you’re so high
[1:28:57] jessielight: they do get rp but they have way too much power
[1:28:58] BLazOR_Prime: one lifers should be on the same level of Locals, i dont get why they are being so serious
[1:28:58] airsurgery: chat shut up and just watch ffs
[1:28:58] Brakdin_: I just watched a clip of ruth where from her stream when she saw the report of your mag dump "This is soooo funny but ruth is going to hate this"
[1:28:59] HeyMeghan: after watching her stream today idk she seems like Ruth is mostly a self insert
[1:28:59] MuddaMoose: its ooc beyond them
[1:29:00] demon_pally: the point all of this is happening is because of them being strict as captains. we wouldn’t have this interpersonal conflict otherwise
[1:29:00] DrWetbone: Not all players stream, so by that they probably don’t care about the entertainment factor.
[1:29:00] Dee__1__: so actions shouldn't have repercussions because its content  HyperLost
[1:29:01] BerryG_333: It's Ssaab
[1:29:01] captain_steve_420: They're good at rp but their phylosophy about rp is off
[1:29:01] calcifero7: yeah most likley
[1:29:01] the_bucket_plays: @EsfandTV ur chat is weird lol
[1:29:01] Yoshi_Squad: tell them OOC
[1:29:02] sirsalem13: Captains do not understand content or entertainment
[1:29:02] TONK: they probably have instructions yeah
[1:29:02] Jrey000: it's them LULW
[1:29:03] KMGP_Outlaw: makes 0 sense at all
[1:29:03] chiefboof024: they know whats goin on Kappa
[1:29:03] Brisk_Avocado: talk to them
[1:29:03] LulahMoon: they are power tripping
[1:29:04] VacB_: i agree with everything but i think the Johnson getting fired was pretty harsh
[1:29:04] DementedToad: @EsfandTV Best Content thus far has been MR.K. taking over the Jail!!!
[1:29:04] CowWizardMoneyGang: yes i genuinely think so
[1:29:05] atwitchusername4me: She laughs and laughs while going over your report, then ends the fun
[1:29:05] bazzzgg: Can someone tell me what a DAP is
[1:29:05] lightwarrior2088: tbf they have more experience i think
[1:29:05] cloudyfate: theres layers to this shit too cause a good rp character/good story  is how people put food on their table irl too. Cant have rp boners ruining that 󠀀
[1:29:05] icephrogg: @EsfandTV They are also dapping cornwood for the brian knight situation so 6 daps
[1:29:05] smith2244b: LMAOOOOOOOOOO 󠀀
[1:29:05] PeterPanTheKing: talk to them ooc
[1:29:06] youngt0ph: Love Ice
[1:29:06] mininni94: @EsfandTV Remember when captains said this? Roleplay over SOPs.  https://clips.twitch.tv/HeadstrongKitschyMonitorJKanStyle--RKlGtqBmf2Dgihx
[1:29:07] Bobb_EH: ask?
[1:29:07] Miterex: by rate -                        dap/time on duty: knight has the highest coefficient, it’s hilarious
[1:29:08] Lucsvm: @EsfandTV deal with the consequences of you actions is also good rp
[1:29:08] TheKingOfWit: maybe they're choking? cause they're forcing a lot of these things this way and then arguing with chat about it
[1:29:08] Smokadabowla: wheres turner been?
[1:29:08] Gachiguru: they are serious RP ride or die
[1:29:08] randybobndyphone: There's definitely some ooc shit above them
[1:29:09] zac4e: I think No Pixel did say they didnt want a repeat of 3.0
[1:29:09] KMGP_Outlaw: also its been like 10 days @EsfandTV
[1:29:09] BraerHZ: Captains want PD to function as game mods, not as Reno 911 (not saying i agree with this) 󠀀
[1:29:09] DanielSauces: @EsfandTV i think captains need the PERCEPTION of accountability to keep non-cop characters happy
[1:29:10] im_so_strange: seeing all this happen makes my brain hurt man
[1:29:10] God_is_a_cat_girl: DAP'ing someone and suspending them is easy, taking them back to academy again and RP with them angry about it but making them go through with it is harder but good content OkayChamp
[1:29:11] zilaprime: esfandVIBE
[1:29:11] ZachFromChat: Who makes the decisions if not them??
[1:29:12] 1manpizza: It's pretty clear the server and the captains have a timeline
[1:29:12] Africannibal: @EsfandTV maybe they get caught up in their leadership roles and stop thinking from a "game" perspective
[1:29:12] IanDooleyTV: i think they are great
[1:29:12] ebos22: Because streaming isn't there source of income mainly?
[1:29:12] MahanGM: people hate ruth, they like slacks and turner
[1:29:13] Rebsdorf_TFT: No, they are going a little to hard into character
[1:29:13] Joongi_: I will keep my thought to myself LULW
[1:29:13] FHviding: i've been quite a bit in cheever stream, its not funny at all
[1:29:13] aggiecreed: lebronJAM
[1:29:14] conorlad: nopixel discord = Hi its ya girl Violet. There are some known issues with the servers currently that are actively being looked at by the devs to be fixed ❤️ it will take time and we appreciate your patience ^.^

[1:29:14] ManakinEU: talk to kyle he lost his marbles about the same shit @EsfandTV  and yes i think they are telling them how to run it ooc
[1:29:15] Bright_san: Go watch Ruth's stream, and you'll enjoy it
[1:29:15] dayvklar: @TheGodmother, I just came back fron the kitchen, what's going on? FeelsDonkMan
[1:29:15] Vengy: at the end of the day it's a rp server but streamers play it
[1:29:16] Yunus1903: @Yunus1903 watch their perspective for one stream and you'll understand
[1:29:16] TORIwoo: ssaab literally says he does not want clowns
[1:29:16] Smalls3122: @EsfandTV have you talked to sssab or cheever yet irl about this?
[1:29:16] zilaprime: esfandVIBE esfandVIBE esfandVIBE
[1:29:16] AivHell: xdd reddit
[1:29:17] r6_ai: Ruth is so good, you can hear laugh on stream while making decisions it's funny.
[1:29:17] FilzG: power tripping
[1:29:17] RaunchyOLDwoman: I think they just have to back off on Daps, Make LSPD fun again
[1:29:17] tyler__96: Sack all the captains and start again
[1:29:18] Janman88: u can clearly tell turner is missing in their 3 captain setup @EsfandTV its failing hard atm
[1:29:19] DismalShark: the only argument against that would be. Why not RP that same situation with other RPers? Could be seen a preferential because you knew the RPer personally.
[1:29:19] jwou11: Cheever literally laughed when reading the report.  But Ruth the character has to be hard on it
[1:29:19] 1vivy: yea the captains understand, its like more about not power tripping other peoples RP (i.e., crime) ig uess
[1:29:20] RuthlessAces: Love this song
[1:29:20] randyrandoe: Classic denial
[1:29:20] WayILive: @esfandtv what would you honestly want them to do then
[1:29:20] driver1036: Xiceman gets it.  Ssaab went from softie to Daptain
[1:29:20] zguy77: Slacks sees it as a real person =real consequences
[1:29:20] TheRealTweex: Honestly I hope Max cleans the PD house and gets new leadership
[1:29:21] akaWallob: Is there an RP illuminati that's making people do things? monkaW
[1:29:21] JO3Y_C: 3.0 Caused the devs to go TOO far the other way.. They have no room for discretion or dont want to lose the power
[1:29:21] dooooooma: there should be transparency atleast @EsfandTV
[1:29:21] thesonofbean: the problem is the conflict between the serious simulation type role players and the more less serious role players
[1:29:21] SavageTarzan: FeelsStrongMan
[1:29:21] CuBanMumzy: they don't want another shit show like 3.0 became
[1:29:22] Mawkatz: They are so good at being jerks. Thats their thing, and they are some of the best ones.
[1:29:22] MahanGM: CHAT WARRR LETSGOOO
[1:29:23] Matcha0515: Loading
[1:29:23] scooberdooberty: you say that, but listening to their vods they literally convince themselves they are doing the right things with daps.
[1:29:23] Biggysnipes: definitely an OOC convo
[1:29:24] Lite_Ice: They need to just get rid of the dap system and start over
[1:29:24] WarSmithPaint: Do good RPers make good leaders? If it's gonna be serious cop RP with serious rules, then anyone appointed to a leadership position should be good at RPing a leader
[1:29:24] Recon_XoX: @Smokadabowla Dealing with serious IRL family issues

[1:29:28] Biffus1337: if u follow the reasoning of some chatters here, every character would need to perma if they get incapacitated.
[1:29:28] DerLuvio: also they told dean the review of the suspension would take 2 - 3 days and now he is suspended for a whole week and still no review
[1:29:28] puppietreats: i think they’re of the mind that all RP is good content.. and it’s not
[1:29:28] UnknownAzn212: At this point there has to be an OOC conversation. Otherwise PD is just going to implode

[1:29:33] Frankendoink: can you request a sitdown talk with all 3 of them? i know some have IRL stuff going on, but seems necessary
[1:29:34] Kelborn: @EsfandTV talk to them IRL, this is obviously gotten to a point where its necesary, because truthfull this part of things makes it not entertaining for us and that is why we are here

[1:29:51] RexPappa: They dont know what they want or where to go and theyre trusting that it will build up in RP
[1:29:52] enfranchise_: SSaab was saying yesterday that "there has to be appropriate consequences and he will rp it out" and Cheever literally said earlier today she "makes decisions based on RP not content or ooc"

[1:30:02] blanket4u: who knew RP philosophy was so deep
[1:30:02] SeaOfEmpty: Moon and x have both said it's unacceptable. X said 2 weeks ago the PD was holding back the server.
[1:30:02] Kelsier10: reminds me of 2.0
[1:30:02] iii_governor_iii: wasn’t 3.0 super entertaining because it was a shitshow?

[1:30:05] CeIoron: its supposed to mimic a real life PD and you cant just fuck around irl, there has to be discipline
[1:30:05] HaZeJgg: I feel like there should be an IC DAP and an OOC DAP, which OOC carrying a lot more weight than IC. IC being for little stuff and OOC being for borderline abuse with powergaming.
[1:30:05] Archangel3003: PD wants more cops in there and on duty, all the while they're suspending and firing people even few weeks LUL
[1:30:07] mikesaysno: pd in 3.0 was watchable. this shit outside of your streams is not watchable
[1:30:07] RobRoads: @esfandtv Have you ever talked to Koil?
[1:30:07] Mawkatz: I'm just waiting for PD to rebel against the Captains.
[1:30:08] c0denameHipp0: I think the fact that someone would watch a Streamer less on one char over another is childish honestly. It gives the streamer an option to potentially do something different.
[1:30:09] n0oxaskek: i just lost 3 iq points by trying to think about that @EsfandTV

[1:30:16] toenipsbetripin: @EsfandTV need to be OOC convo with devs and cpt
[1:30:16] thxperiment: its not the servers fault its the players Aware
[1:30:17] HeyMeghan: when the crims agree that the DAPS are wrong that’s fucked up
[1:30:18] God_is_a_cat_girl: 3.0 became worse because they were catering to crims too much, then they 180º and made it worse, so the captains aren't preventing 3.0, they are making it happen
[1:30:18] Cujodk: i dont think 3.0 crims vs 4.0 cops is a good formula
[1:30:18] Connorbrow: @slight621 Which is weird, because Koil has categorically stated that in the past
[1:30:18] LogicWeasel: Shift 1 is a SHITSHOW
[1:30:18] KaBOOM79: wait WHAAATT
[1:30:19] grlgunk: shift 3 needs to stage a mutiny over shift 1

[1:30:20] Gachiguru: Shift 2 shit talks you a lot too @EsfandTV

[1:30:25] albakrut: Ruth always says " Its gotta be found in RP"
[1:30:25] Welshstig: get the sheriff's office, make good changes, and the pd will probably follow @EsfandTV
[1:30:27] lawlkat: it's so funny when you ask people for specifics and they go silent
[1:30:27] greyjulian: @archangel3003 and have too few FTO’s to train new hires who get tired of waiting to get trained
[1:30:27] Ganelon: that BG music perfect for the server status...
[1:30:28] LogicWeasel: Shift 1 is the shitshow-shift
[1:30:28] pallywacker117: @EsfandTV Ruth was saying, that at the begnning we need to make the PD super serious cause other wise down the road its harder to make a PD serious. Saying its okay to have 1 out of 10 PD sbs but apparently right now theres a big mess of people bsing
[1:30:28] slight621: @Connorbrow right

[1:30:31] CaptLaw44: cornwood open the shirif office and his the law up norh XD

[1:30:32] loveandsupply: why don’t they want cornwood to get the sheriffs office going?
[1:30:35] djSimSi: everything went wrong when Den Zel got his last dap @EsfandTV
[1:30:35] the_bucket_plays: when you have a dap system that is used against the PD mainly for doing their jobs and worrying about imaginary children and locals that dont really matter
[1:30:37] f0rbin: isn't conflict in the PD also content?
[1:30:37] MahanGM: @dayvklar DankL
[1:30:38] thefeckening: People are pretending like this is real life, and not a game, its actually scary how sad it is sometimes

[1:30:44] Shankaze: shift 1 = school girls? Kappa
[1:30:44] smbsocal: PD should be held to a higher standard.  If you want to be a sh*t lord be one but not in PD.

[1:30:46] thebigshabam: @EsfandTV the dap system is broken, the most active people get punished the most by raw numbers. you get 10 daps in 60 days, people who only work ALL of thier shifts are at more risk than people who only work 2-3 times a week
[1:30:47] ZuldeadTV: to be fair the most exciting things about 4.0 PD is watching cornwood and some cops trying to change it, because right now it sucks and make people frustrated
[1:30:47] MackPlays: Doesnt seem like they want anything, they are kinda coasting
[1:30:47] Zenysa: if they wanna penalize PD for doing something entertaining, then there needs to be code to facilitate a vigilante arch. like where it pushes the RP if the captains are too strict
[1:30:49] Pibon1: @johnnycolision Mundo duel the Capitans Pog

[1:31:21] TheRealTweex: When you have Ruth saying NoPixel is not a content server, what do you expect?
[1:31:22] CopperKat: Who the fuck did Koil hire that is forcing these shit decisions? Who on the dev team is causing this mess? Can you literally find out OOC? @EsfandTV
[1:31:22] bigpharmaa: Copeless

[1:31:25] Biggysnipes: its HR RP @EsfandTV KEKW
[1:31:25] stew3161: Cheever is a good streamer, but Ruth is the worst.  The character is driver to create division not teamwork

[1:31:25] iknowgoats: people want to police stuff as free as crims/civs can do but being apart of the PD you have to follow annoying rules

[1:31:25] zac4e: Adress it OOC then?
[1:31:25] Scully_18: Shift 1 is awful. honestly nothing fun happens now.
[1:31:26] RichardNoggin4: @EsfandTV Koil said pd controls pd unless violation of rules. You have to RP Cornwood into a position to do something about it.
[1:31:26] ZuldeadTV: Clap Clap Clap Clap
[1:31:27] Real23Phil: i just assume they want overly strict leadership so there's a story

[1:31:31] MacVane: Yeah don't think they've leadered
[1:31:32] puppietreats: @toylettreat the way it’s panning out it’s on,y becoming frustrating ooc for streamers, and annoying for viewers.
[1:31:32] RobialT: They care more about coddling crims than having an actual PD
[1:31:33] SG8970: To be fair, it fits all of the Captain's characters to DAP for excessive shooting, whether it's a shit character or not
[1:31:33] serioushustle: Seriously need an OOC meeting
[1:31:33] lightwarrior2088: imo ur idea of "good roleplay" conflicts with the vision of the  PD at start of server

[1:31:46] SouthPaw1724: CROSSED
[1:31:47] lawlkat: @EsfandTV the problem is, the captains think "Friction = Content". This inherently isn't always true. it's like writing in an annoying teenager in a show. it's just bad writing

[1:32:02] dayvklar: @Hawaiianbreado, TOOBASED
[1:32:03] Vexamas: that's your opinion though, and they want to force that vision, for better or worse
[1:32:04] daltonlowe74: they made it too much of a real job and not enough of the fun
[1:32:04] deaddays616: Cheever7 said income and viewership shouldn't affect RP
[1:32:04] Huso833: they don’t respect cop RP
[1:32:05] GregoryGHarding: Based on past experiences daytime streamers aren't exactly the most mature people
[1:32:05] ManakinEU: @EsfandTV have you tried or considered ONX server ?
[1:32:06] LogicWeasel: that's the bottom line, cuz stone cold said so TOOBASED
[1:32:06] dapyman: Cheever said earlier that RP trumps Content which blew my mind
[1:32:06] 300ducks: i think having strict cops is good, but its not good when all of PD command is made up of strict cops
[1:32:07] dayvklar: @SouthPaw1724, WideHardo
[1:32:07] gadget_t: How so?

[1:32:08] SouthPaw1724: @TheGodmother FROGS
[1:32:10] chmod_R_777: I think the problem is a Server philosophy... it's bigger than LSPD Command and that would be really bad
[1:32:10] dayvklar: @TheGodmother, WideHardo

[1:32:16] SouthPaw1724: @dayvklar WideHardo

[1:32:17] MahanGM: the fact that we're having this conversation means pd will never be fixed LULW
[1:32:17] loveandsupply: the content we want is Cornwood taking over sheriffs office and creating massive content
[1:32:19] comato4st: @SeaOfEmpty remember when mr k said all of the cops were useless except cornwood, and called ruth all those names
[1:32:20] Top5Lels: and its fine, its called adapting
[1:32:20] JO3Y_C: D:
[1:32:20] the_bucket_plays: im pretty sure at the begining the PD was worried more about just being a cop

[1:35:03] Welshstig: @EsfandTV the only way to fix it without going ooc is through putting processes in place. like pd members having a way to vote out leaders

[1:35:11] soupnattzi: How about vigilante @esfandtv ??
[1:35:12] RichardNoggin4: @EsfandTV Koil said pd controls pd unless violation of rules. You have to RP Cornwood into a position to do something about it.
[1:35:12] Lordrune13: Not Yet

[1:35:17] Lucsvm: @EsfandTV you dont think you are overthink a lot about this?, maybe let the captains do what they want them you talk about
[1:35:18] icephrogg: Cornwood is also getting a dap for the brian knight situation so 6 daps

[1:35:26] Encryptic: One thing that I think happens with DAPs that drives me nuts is they're supposed to teach a lesson, but generally, good teaching starts with repetition. The first instance of a mistake shouldn't be a DAP, it should be a warning.

[1:35:28] BobFromAccounts: This is a game, but for the streamers and devs, its also a work place. The PD is lacking major leadership imo. You dont go around loping off heads and throwing DAPs at every single fault. There is coaching and counselling, retraining, etc
[1:35:28] Gr1zzz: its just not fun or enjoyable dunno why they dont seei t
[1:35:28] BaitIHaveUlt: even the crims are finding it annoying the PD isn’t in a good place
[1:35:28] GordoComeDoritos: Privete Mechanic Investigator Cornwood

[1:35:30] Roo_Void: I dunno...when Cornwood dressed as Barbara...that was pretty criminal!

[1:35:52] murcielagoRS: HOP IN
[1:35:52] Africannibal: @EsfandTV The only way that you'll probably see changes to the PD will be to have an OOC conversation with one of the captains with what you just discussed.
[1:35:53] jeblowmi: in saabs stream yesterday they legit said people getting in trouble in the pd shouldnt affect their real life. which isnt true and they could just rp as another character and get over it essentially which is wild

Esfand tries to pinch his butt closed but that makes his insides hurt. The poop accelerates. He calls 911. The paramedics call for doctors. The doctors call for specialists. The story trends on Twitter. Esfand turns down talk show appearances. His septic tank fails. People form a cult. His toilet is finished.

[8:12:44] ihhunt3r: DAP's need to have an actual disciplinary action plan and not just be like a strike point in-practice. If the officer shows improvement & they don't commit the same infraction in like a 30-day period, it gets removed. If not it stays and counts toward the 10 DAP limit leading to indefinite suspension pending review

[8:13:46] mrk5ive: The only thing good about this car is the way it sounds and it seems like it can take a beating

[8:14:08] crazyazzkile: @CrystalDimension, BASED

[8:14:54] Vizumn: @Toastedgamer03 oh is it 60 days currently? It should definitely be 30
[8:14:58] CrystalDimension: @Toastedgamer03 but they have irl/ ooc consequences

[8:15:41] Kovalenced: @Vizumn Ruth wanted to make it 90 minimum Sadge

[8:15:53] zombyfart: officer hawkslacks?
[8:16:03] Toastedgamer03: but the key point of what makes daps just like strike points are that no one is learning from their daps since the captains don't tell people how to improve

[8:16:31] ligament_champion: dicktone
[8:16:34] SmugPls: There isnt much more to be said. Daps are dumb, the implementation is dumb. Slacks and Ruth want the PD to be hyper realistic essentially because they thought 3.0 was to silly. But the rest of the server doesnt seem alligned to that

[8:17:04] RatBrick: the premier handles better and is faster with a 99mm
[8:17:04] jd2881: I swear when yall had it a couple weeks ago it was all wheel drive. Really need to get McNulty in there cause he had most seat time in it back then.

[8:17:44] miketwng: sequential is so good
[8:17:47] SmugPls: Nor is getting DAP stacked for 1 incident
[8:17:48] zy7yz: 99 too much, try a 50
[8:17:55] Ross_McD: Yeah like a 59
[8:17:59] theJOATx: put a turbo in the glovebox LUL
[8:18:04] LogicWeasel: ICANT  20 fps in this game with his 4090 holky shit

[8:18:39] Ross_McD: Id try like a 70 to 80 range
[8:18:43] Toastedgamer03: also yeah i can see an argument for 10 daps being not enough for a indefinite suspension when most people who get dap'd are getting 4 daps per incident
[8:18:56] Skylo97: the answer is probably high midrange turbo with sequential

[8:33:40] d3ath_p00l: sounds like all the turbos are missing.......
[8:33:40] Luthercorpz: Little Alamo invested in turbos when it was good KEKW

[8:34:05] offbrand: its around 400k
[8:34:05] Wintyer2: yeah  I know who got those turbos too
[8:34:05] comrade_raptor: how long cornwood been on the hook for this cash man? like a month lol
[8:34:06] Thunderpint: Gotta leverage those two stolen turbos and the transmission before you put them back

[8:34:08] xnightshift2658: stolen or misplaced?
[8:34:10] zilaprime: Ugh never gonna get paid back at this rate Madge
[8:34:11] Techno_Plumber: Not your problem financially to fund the pd alone.
[8:34:12] shesamaniac: Ah so they haven't paid it back yet...ahh I see.
[8:34:15] PacGamer: @God_is_a_cat_girl kekw 󠀀
[8:34:15] lucnith: 1 99 188
[8:34:16] PappaMidNight: @UsesEmotesWrong he let him borrow that
[8:34:16] cedemusic: wait, people can just rip out something u bought from your engine without keys?
[8:34:19] splooshtasticals: @panda_snack Wonder wats going on in the background pepeLaugh U can feel emotions rise when he does things
[8:34:19] brownsan64: Did you agree on 150K
[8:34:20] thesonofbean: dude i would pull them all
[8:34:22] eklu65: Do you think slacks is holding them to counter troll you
[8:34:24] darksidefett: ask for a personal vehicle from the state on top
[8:34:24] ethanmn1280: time to sell them to mr K
[8:34:24] cjdudeman: stolen turbos are bought at street price instead of wholesale
[8:34:27] mandera22: When you first made the arrangement did you agree on a price at the time?
[8:34:28] jessielight: until hes paid for those they are legally his turbos
[8:34:28] Vikairius: Honestly, could civil suit the LSPD.
[8:34:28] bbcherbearr: didnt you get a tip the other day about someone going to try and steal them
[8:34:30] faroeislands_: Is that including the transmission that went missing? @esfandtv
[8:34:33] Connorbrow: Cornwood keeps saying he's straight talking, but he's definitely not been telling Slacks what he needs to say
[8:34:35] hollowrust: is he cam lagging?
[8:34:44] i_am_jam_: one day he will see spaceboy chat xD
[8:34:44] docshaayy: @Connorbrow so true
[8:34:47] coach_dad: Cheese car parts
[8:34:49] Kelborn: @EsfandTV can they do different tires on this car? For traction?
[8:34:51] Serakkis: Slacks also wasn't fazed by two turbos going missing
[8:34:54] Sibrav: vstr
[8:34:55] sourdoughcookies: tell her to bill slacks since he bought the car
[8:34:55] Kohilenn: vstr
[8:34:55] theblackdog808: only think that I'm thinking about is, how do you meme the whole situation
[8:34:57] EvilCoatrack: so it drives like shit AND is expensive to repair.
[8:34:57] Techno_Plumber: someone stole them from you. not the pd
[8:34:58] jessielight: and if they are getting stolen and nothing is going to be done will he get his money back?
[8:34:59] Dynomyth: I haven’t seen Cornwood for compensation, is he just not going to?
[8:35:00] blahder: If a car is sitting at mosley, couldn't anyone with mechanic skills run up when no one is looking and steal a turbo?
[8:35:00] hadrianwpg: Chat top speed?
[8:35:02] lindsayrose_: did you give a turbo to someone with a bike? @esfandtv
[8:35:06] shesamaniac: Nah but that is kinda crappy someone taking them out the PD cars. That's kinda...just...grimey...it ruins it for everyone
[8:35:06] wildarrow88: I disagree
[8:35:08] Titantrace1: Do you think it was the officer who the mechanic said was doing it?
[8:35:11] Icestruggler: Slacks seemed pretty careless about you saying 2 Turbos got stolen
[8:35:12] catfish_quackenbush: @lindsayrose_ 180
[8:35:13] Dynomyth: I haven’t seen Cornwood ask for compensation, is he just not going to?
[8:35:26] Bannanabread04: It just hits everything, dont know why
[8:35:34] AnusReaktorMan: @shesamaniac captain should think about it before
[8:35:37] Maz0hyst: @shesamaniac Perhaps the PD should pay like they said they would 4Shrug
[8:35:38] Ficktions: I mean, even with turbos stolen, you're getting paid the amount for all of them, so it's the PD being stolen from in the end
[8:35:40] newtricksterx: lol
[8:35:40] Kohilenn: also remember to replace turbo
[8:35:41] wildarrow88: It's good at what is does, but not much else
[8:35:41] theshaolinpanda: Slacks is the Great Promiser but nothing ever happens
[8:35:41] HadEbola: @Dynomyth thats what the whole convo was about? cornwood wants his pay
[8:35:50] i_am_jam_: the turbos were in PD possession, stolen ones arent ur responsibility you should still be paid for them @EsfandTV
[8:35:52] droksid00: @Icestruggler my guess is he's thinking the pd's  paying for them anyway so it doesn't matter net to cornwood
[8:35:53] offbrand: @Ficktions this
[8:35:56] Connorbrow: @icestruggler at the same time he's saying that they're effectively PD's pending payment
[8:35:58] Kohilenn: Pog
[8:36:03] Techno_Plumber: been a month without compensation basically for the turbos
[8:36:04] jessielight: @Ficktions the pd does not own the turbos yet as they have not paid for them
[8:36:05] shesamaniac: @maz0hyst eh I mean. As in someone stealing them. Not Cornwood..
[8:36:08] R3d_Gum: @EsfandTV didnt lionel or jonathan told you someone was playing with them?
[8:36:14] Maz0hyst: @shesamaniac Oo word KEKW
[8:36:16] Jrey000: why are people fighting about this the PD has had multiple months to pay cornwood and they haven't LULW
[8:36:16] Ficktions: @jessielight They agreed on a price for all of them
[8:36:18] xseaka: @shesamaniac they never would have even been there, talk about entitled
[8:36:20] shesamaniac: @anusreaktorman can you expand?
[8:36:26] poofisonfps: being a real mechanic makes me wanna be a mechanic in rp
[8:36:26] spicyville: are the devs genuinely bad at optimizing these cars to be nerfed a little for PD use or are they trying to get you to RP test then?
[8:36:29] thechosenjay: Cheer100 you should go tank 19 rounds again <3
[8:36:30] StreamElements: Watch my latest video: CORNWOOD SHOWS THE PD HOW ITS DONE - https://youtube.com/watch?v=-j7kwBCc-Ow
[8:36:30] coppertec: real talk, is cornwood taking the turbos an insurance against getting dapped/canned?
[8:36:35] splooshtasticals: @Jrey000 pepeLaugh plenty of time
[8:36:37] cedemusic: yeah she's whispering
[8:36:39] TheIrishCanuck: Just take all the turbos if anything happens
[8:36:41] jessielight: @Ficktions and when the price is paid then its the pds property
[8:36:46] Craxxbones: The PD has not paid cornwood in what a month, that is not right, they should not hold him to the old pricing
[8:36:51] shesamaniac: @xseaka I'm not following here what you mean
[8:36:52] BrainOnAutopilot: ahhh my eyes
[8:36:54] lmaotier: Stare
[8:36:54] Mic_Stargazer: multiple months? the turbos jsut got put in a few weeks ago lol
[8:36:57] ozieman3o5: Stare
[8:36:57] Frostlogic: Where's her eye protection Cornwood?!?!?
[8:36:58] theJOATx: @Craxxbones facts
[8:36:59] KJCornettttt: @coppertec that's what i'm hoping but i'm not sure
[8:37:04] Jrey000: @Craxxbones yea exactly LULw
[8:37:06] Dynomyth: @hadebola esfand wants Cordwoods pay, Cornwood may not like asking was my point
[8:37:08] Pakkasparkers: whats the talk about cornwood getting dapped?
[8:37:09] xseaka: @shesamaniac nah i misunderstood your comment <3 no worries
[8:37:14] cedemusic: i never realized there was a ladder there
[8:37:15] panda_snack: pd taking advantage of cornwoods good will
[8:37:15] CalculatedRH: @spicyville They lost their #1 Car Builder/Balancer Dev so
[8:37:17] Maz0hyst: @spicyville I think they're doing it for RPs sake. Gives a reason to RP a testing scenario instead of PD just getting new random cars one day
[8:37:20] brinderwalt42: @esfandth Didn’t Lionel tell Cornwood Ramee was planning to steal turbos from PD vehicles?
[8:37:23] offbrand: @Mic_Stargazer bro its been over a month monkaW
[8:37:30] Wintyer2: @cedemusic NPC up there give missions
[8:37:38] Connorbrow: @craxxbones The wholesale price is the same as when he got them. It's just there's not been larger ones on sale for a while so market prices are inflated
[8:37:39] ebos22: Ssaab been fired up little today....his stream title is Judgement day lol
[8:37:40] cedemusic: @Wintyer2 ah, thx
[8:37:41] splooshtasticals: They're always finding ways to screw over cornwood. Peeps are noticing now NODDERS
[8:37:44] tolmangamgee: holy
[8:37:46] Kohilenn: oh yeah, you can add extra breaks
[8:37:48] Kohilenn: brakes
[8:37:49] RicoLoco52: should probably just start a running invoice for all the money you've put into the PD that isn't your personal stuff
[8:37:50] theshaolinpanda: Dear Lord
[8:38:00] offbrand: @RicoLoco52 he has
[8:38:01] theshaolinpanda: Keep the Turbos, save it for LASO
[8:38:05] mad0monk: All I am saying is that Cornwood has more hours, more money, and more interaction with citizens then any officer on the force. They treat you bad and people talk behind your back and it's insane to me. They owe you and if they are gonna act up then they get what they deserve
[8:38:07] shesamaniac: @xseaka all good lol. Kinda why I don't like chatting too much. Chat goes so fast and can't really get a sense of everyone's intents in their comments especially with hoppers lol
[8:38:07] docshaayy: so much drama, so little police work is the issue
[8:38:07] RicoLoco52: @offbrand that's good
[8:38:09] slomojosh: surely slacks wouldn’t pressure Cornwood to putting the turbos back so they can suspend him and he can’t do anything about it
[8:38:09] Slymask3: OMEGALAUGHING
[8:38:11] Rebsdorf_TFT: EZ
[8:38:15] cedemusic: Essaying

[8:38:45] theshaolinpanda: Boys we need to get the Texas Ranger going
[8:38:46] cedemusic: ASSEMBLE
[8:38:46] jessielight: plus if they suspend or fire him he cant get back to get them and now he is out both the turbos and the cash
[8:38:47] TheKRT: @slomojosh im pretty sure thats what is happening
[8:38:47] mandera22: where does the PDs budget come from? why are the so fcking broke in the first place

[8:39:01] slomojosh: yeah it’s pretty clear they keep delaying it
[8:39:04] Gusty331: Cornwood becoming too powerful because of the hours he puts in and they hate it EZ
[8:39:08] WhatIsTOS: The turbos create great leverage for Cornwood over PD ETC YEAH?
[8:39:08] theJOATx: id say fk the PD at this point good on him for sticking with it
[8:39:08] ShadyMashX: Alot of ppl say 5 but it's actually 6. Da
[8:39:12] Maz0hyst: @mandera22 The State. PD has like 2 mil or something iirc the convo between Slacks and Cornwood
[8:39:15] un_heilig: PD still a shitshow and it will remain as such until people quit
[8:39:15] theshaolinpanda: The Fed isnt going to pay PD anymore
[8:39:19] Mr_Jaffs: What was his plan to get out of the daps??
[8:39:19] HeyMeghan: if they were doing me like they’re doing cornwood I’d stop being so helpful. he’s better than me.
[8:39:23] icephrogg: chat tmr or the day after cornwood will get his 6 daps sadge
[8:39:27] theshaolinpanda: They are supposed to pool their money
[8:39:30] splooshtasticals: They fear change above all. My theory is that there are bozos trying to control the pace of the server & trying to make it out how they want it. Too many odd coincidences.
[8:39:33] ShadyMashX: The brain knight aziz adoption fraud stuff is another dap too
[8:39:34] OddSwizzle: @mandera22 they were done to 250k a few days ago
[8:39:38] Techno_Plumber: Cornwood holding turbos in exchange for daps
[8:39:39] SmugPls: THe PD budget last i saw on Ssaabs stream was liek 200k or so in the bank
[8:39:49] coppertec: it really is a 5head move by cornwood
[8:39:50] jessielight: I wouldn't put them in until I know if I will have a job. if its up to Ruth it is less likely. she talked about manslaughter charges
[8:39:52] Maz0hyst: @OddSwizzle KEKW The fuck they spending all the money on
[8:39:59] RicoLoco52: @SmugPls but what is that for?
[8:40:01] lunaciy: lunaciy subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[8:40:03] theshaolinpanda: Thats not a horrible idea. you can pay off DAPS as a fund raiser
[8:40:06] mandera22: feels like they need to increase it at least a bit
[8:40:07] theJOATx: if i were about to get suspended id pull the turbos too
[8:40:07] shesamaniac: Nice to see Cornwood putting it on the table more. Sometimes ya just gotta throw that thang on the table
[8:40:08] Usahi_Light: I mean the pace of he server does need to be controlled ,that's why they're stalling Sandy
[8:40:16] FauxReal__: SCATTER

[8:40:27] mistacastro01: esfand irl gang banging
[8:40:39] SwagnificentTG: Carola modCheck
[8:40:39] SmugPls: The money is.. i dont know? Apparently someone was saying Ruth on stream said that she doesnt think the other offices should open because the PD cant afford to "Buy the locations" or something IC
[8:40:43] Kohilenn: turbo change
[8:41:00] im_so_strange: back after a few hours. anything big happen??
[8:41:06] ncs_310: @smugpls doesn’t make sense
[8:41:21] Bannanabread04: S for Sucks
[8:41:22] theJOATx: @im_so_strange more PD corruption
[8:41:23] LogicWeasel: it's the worst of the S class
[8:41:24] SmugPls: S = Sucks
[8:41:24] PappaMidNight: @im_so_strange not that i can recall

[8:41:34] doutplayd: S for slide around a corner and get ejected
[8:41:35] catfish_quackenbush: the grip is way too low for an S class
[8:41:35] DazedenConfused: the orange and red packets from chinese places dont mix.. stick to one or the other
[8:41:37] CrystalDimension: @SmugPls because most people don't know that PD is not going to be financed from the state
[8:41:38] bertacharm: what does 10-2 actually mean i just know its a positive response for a radio check
[8:41:39] Kelborn: @EsfandTV can they do different tires for better traction?
[8:41:41] jeffrey778: let him drive it see what he thinks
[8:41:43] Maz0hyst: PD budget in shambles because they've been keeping Duncan afloat from all his phone calls to phone sex lines since he likes to just Duncaning the workers for 16 hours
[8:41:45] Connorbrow: @maz0hyst The PD budget is tiny, the state itself has 30 million or something, but for some reason they've not increased PD budget yet
[8:41:45] cedemusic: Slow Class
[8:41:48] LogicWeasel: the Axel
[8:41:55] shesamaniac: @smugpls I had a feeling that's what it may have been .. which is something I been silently agonizing over. Cause BibleThump
[8:41:57] pontiicus: deepest voice in 4.0 gyatt
[8:41:58] TraviiiOnTwitch: the biggest problem is the lack of throttle modulation. this thing would drive a lot better on controller or pedals
[8:42:00] Techno_Plumber: Cornwood Good Food Dood
[8:42:05] BigglesVII: Would it be worth putting a rear spoiler on it?
[8:42:13] ShadyMashX: Making this car all wheel drive w OK

[8:42:18] droksid00: chat can you log out of hd2 so i can spread democracy a bit
[8:42:21] ShadyMashX: Would fix*
[8:42:21] shesamaniac: Cornwoods works enough hours to find the sheriff's department
[8:42:22] Maz0hyst: @Connorbrow I know, I was here when they were talking about pd budget and how much they got OKEY
[8:42:25] mandera22: @Connorbrow Feels like that is an underlying cause of a handful of problems
[8:42:27] HadEbola: @im_so_strange slacks told cornwood to "return the turbos" to their rightful place
[8:42:27] shesamaniac: Fund*
[8:42:33] LogicWeasel: 82.4
[8:42:34] HeyMeghan: surely cornwood gets reimbursed for this
[8:42:42] Good_Times_95: @BigglesVII x2 try a spoiler!
[8:42:45] Maz0hyst: @droksid00 Only day I haven't been able to get on NOOO
[8:42:50] CrystalDimension: @TraviiiOnTwitch I'm pretty sure you could drive on keyboard and pedals at the same time
[8:42:53] barthy__: @Connorbrow yeah its weird especially if the state isnt funding new business/properties either, whats the point of the money LUL
[8:43:04] arcaneprofet: literally buying a turbo now lmao

[8:43:21] aMFlashh: Does cornwood really care about the money for the turbos ??

[8:43:24] Kohilenn: its cheaper than a civ buffalo stx LUL
[8:43:24] WhatIsTOS: PART PRICES?
[8:43:30] droksid00: @Maz0hyst ive been in queue for so long. i thought the patch meant it was going to get fixed
[8:43:31] coppertec: maybe cornwood should just flip the turbos and buy himself the most beastly PD personal car, and be the one guy taking down all the crims
[8:43:32] cedemusic: cornwood should start a corrupt arc and be the kingpin of a crime ring to pay for the sheriff's department
[8:43:33] coach_dad: STARE
[8:43:34] Abduleon_: chat did he talk to slacks yet
[8:43:38] Lordrune13: saekokStare saekokStare saekokStare

[8:43:45] pontiicus: chat has y’all played helldivers 2 yet if so is it good ?
[8:43:47] Craxxbones: Its not about the money, its about how the PD is shitting on Cornwood so much
[8:43:48] Toastbane: Does nopixel support analog throttle?
[8:43:50] fotakisgr: whats this mod everyone is playnng
[8:43:54] Bannanabread04: @droksid00 No, just stabilizing
[8:43:55] Ancor_: they should be in the cvpi since its dogshit without
[8:43:56] coach_dad: Its about sending a message CORNMAN
[8:43:56] Kelborn: and not being stolen
[8:43:57] coppertec: in the right place for the right price(job security)
[8:43:59] thxperiment: just put all the smaller ones you have in first
[8:44:02] blahder: What place I'd that though?
[8:44:03] shesamaniac: Slacks. My guy, him not knowing the market for turbos was high is a bit wild. Like if he's shocked then that payment sounds like it's gonna be further delayed
[8:44:04] splooshtasticals: let them save money like u have if they want it that bad.
[8:44:04] TexanRampage92: And the cold war of days and turbos
[8:44:05] daedayz: isnt it to show how down bad pd woulda been
[8:44:06] droksid00: @pontiicus yes. i can't explain it. it's tense and difficult without being annoying
[8:44:08] SmugPls: The liek captains or someone should be able to 'lock' them in place on shared cars
[8:44:09] Brakon: I mean could cvpi be the right place for now since the are so bad with out them
[8:44:10] Uses_Profanity: Cornwood Punisher arc when?
[8:44:13] EmDuBB13: not only that he acts like he already owns them
[8:44:14] SwagnificentTG: Cornwood cares about the mechanic shop workers Gladge
[8:44:15] theJOATx: put the 20s turbos in the cars LUL
[8:44:15] captain_steve_420: Cheever said today she doesnt think the turbos are a big deal
[8:44:15] genesissukehiro: slacks was out of line
[8:44:16] lucnith: could have crims stole them when they took police vehicles?
[8:44:17] AnusReaktorMan: 1. Pay for turbos 180k / 2. Get 5-6 DAPS for onelife character / 3. Profit EZ
[8:44:27] physica_: @pontiicus i've only heard good things, except for the server log wait issues
[8:44:27] pontiicus: @droksid00 it’s got my eye rn esfandScoots
[8:44:29] ben_v_art: put some ether on it
[8:44:29] Maz0hyst: @droksid00 Was meant to help a bit alongside matchmaking. The problem is the backend code not being able to support so many people at once. So they're working on that + working on getting more servers spun up and working NODDERS
[8:44:36] Techno_Plumber: It sucks you don’t get paid they got stolen
[8:44:37] Biggysnipes: PD cares so much about one life character to give cornwood 6 daps. That will surely get the trust of the city NODDERS
[8:44:38] Joongi_: It's pretty funny to me how Slacks thinks Cornwood is taking the turbos as a rebelious act when he literally told him he was going to do be changing them kekw
[8:44:40] Sizzlaa: chubbe1Snuggies sayonara
[8:44:40] Kelborn: @captain_steve_420 she hasnt driven a cvpi without them since the start
[8:44:42] pontiicus: @physica_ heard sweet ty
[8:44:42] Jrey000: @EsfandTV OOC do you recognize how Cornwood is clearly being miss treated ? Just a question I wonder your Pov on this issue.
[8:44:45] icephrogg: well tmr cornwood wont need to worry he will be suspended so just take em all back lol
[8:44:49] splooshtasticals: -2 ain't so bad. They wish they stole more i bet
[8:44:49] cedemusic: what would you call the story arc that cornwood's in right now?
[8:44:53] HeyMeghan: yeah.  don’t think slacks understood that’s what you were saying.
[8:45:04] taraannee: is ur radio off?
[8:45:07] doutplayd: chat is all essays rn damn
[8:45:08] Micahx06: think it’ll be a late one tonight chat?!
[8:45:11] catfish_quackenbush: @Jrey000 what do you mean mistreated?
[8:45:13] blahder: I don't either tbf been trying to figure it out
[8:45:14] Bannanabread04: @Maz0hyst Yep, not really about server space. more about the code for handling more then 500k people
[8:45:15] Joongi_: @Sizzlaa Sananara 4Head
[8:45:16] shesamaniac: @techno_plumber yeah. And the response gave wasn't exactly remorseful or reassuring a payment would come for those that were stolen
[8:45:20] droksid00: @Maz0hyst im not mad at indy companies having these issues. especially when the game is over performing so much. blizz has this issue so i salute the devs.
[8:45:24] locksley94: Is that a V8 or V6 ?
[8:45:25] Uses_Profanity: @cedemusic Cuck of the state
[8:45:26] Vikairius: Cornwood is in the age of cloak and daggers right now.
[8:45:28] Maz0hyst: @droksid00 HD1 had like 20k people or something so they genuinely didn't expect it to blow up this much. kekw going from that amount to 600k+
[8:45:29] Techno_Plumber: slacks wants free faster cars.

[8:45:38] doutplayd: WideHardo
[8:45:38] SmugPls: Slacks probably thinks getting more 88s and 99s is easier than it is. And presumes that the "rightful place" is in random cars until new stuff comes out for new cars
[8:45:39] cedemusic: @Uses_Profanity esfandLUL
[8:45:41] Joongi_: WideHardo Yaaaaaaaaa
[8:45:41] droksid00: @pontiicus its so good. it doesn't seem like it would be but it is.
[8:45:43] thegummibearmassacre: KKornwood TakingNotes
[8:46:00] AndHaka54: in way slack is right, if cornwood and slacks made a deal for pd to buy them off. Cornwood isn't allowed to just take them away. it would be like breaking deal. which in turn can ruin trust

[9:11:04] ncs_310: but also it doesn’’t make sense why it is being dragged out
[9:11:05] timtheboneman: the plan is absolutely to apply on another character cornshould and its just cornwood without a mustache lol
[9:11:05] ChocolateMassage: pd needs a rat exterminator
[9:11:06] shesamaniac: Commence power fueling
[9:11:06] ShadyMashX: At minimum it's 1 dap cuz of the aziz brain knight stuff which results in suspension

[9:11:13] naturally79: cornwood is hiring ramee to defend him from his daps????
[9:11:14] h4shm4nder: cordwood’s plan …..if they say no shoot them
[9:11:15] Sarcastic_Sidekick: i think slacks feels insecure after cornwood showed how much mroe competent he is (with the sound proofing etc)
[9:11:18] genesissukehiro: fuk daps get ir cornwood
[9:11:19] Spired12: https://i.imgur.com/WaDjH89.png For those who keep asking about the daps. Esfand has already seen this. -SPOILERS

[9:11:48] thegummibearmassacre: Chatting
[9:11:48] frickjerm: youre at 4 daps rn and they fall off in a week
[9:11:52] PsychoJoker: @SmugPls also got to take into account those were ruths suggestions the captains can meet and put their 2 cents in about it and say no this doesnt need a dap or no it shouldnt be 5 etc
[9:11:52] stevarino707: eating that sandwich like Al Bundy like its a harmonica
[9:11:52] AnusReaktorMan: 5 daps for one lifer and 1 dap for brian knight situation. So 10 total?
[9:11:54] miketwng: Cornwood eats old corn
[9:12:01] hatake_kakashixd: chat why might he get suspended?
[9:12:06] InsecureForSure: hackerCD
[9:12:07] blickyglizz: any vehicular manslaughter yet today?
[9:12:09] SmugPls: @PappaMidNight Some say its because the Turbos are hostage. Some say Slacks wants to let him live out the night
[9:12:13] icephrogg: cornwood did get daps taking off but tmr he will recieve 6 daps
[9:12:17] ShadowedSeraphim: You'll probably get dap'd for the same reasoning that Johnson did for the fight
[9:12:21] el_jotaro_: @miketwng he eats corn made out of wood

[9:13:10] pontiicus: esfandPls
[9:13:10] mitcheruss: Opening statement also
[9:13:11] twilightbaseballscene: LUL
[9:13:11] Smapdi_Flaffermann: Disappointing that Cornywood just turned down that free shower.  He's gotta be getting pretty ripe
[9:13:17] SmugPls: Realistically calling out the "He was not actually crawling" is really dumb. Thats just IC RP embelishment that other people are choosing to pretend cant be a thing
[9:13:19] knowlightnofear: you should switch back to the CVPI, can't afford the repairs on this thing
[9:13:19] Jrey000: but if he get's 5 daps Cornwood would only have 9 ?
[9:13:21] doublexpeach57: You forgot to put the gas nozzle back
[9:13:31] Neekapkilla: Too many people's characters in the PD are playing this tattle tale, get one over on my co-worker style character. It's good to have 1, like we had with Duncan. But when you have 5...6...7 the sneaky snake RP goes too far, at least for me as a viewer

[9:13:42] miketwng: chet why do cars drive slower for Cornwood
[9:13:47] mrbradley503: Why would they stack 5 daps for the same incident? Thats the thing I dont understand.
[9:13:48] BigglesVII: @Jrey000 Hes looking at 5 for one incident and 1 for another.
[9:13:52] syntafl3xbppb: Slymask3 thank you dankHug
[9:13:53] dr_goobyy: Lmfao love the fact that cornwood is a jack of all trades
[9:13:56] Switchblade142: @Jrey000 Hes already getting 1 extra for "coercing knight" even though he specifically told him not to change his statement
[9:13:57] Kohilenn: you can do auto-auto

[9:14:12] SkywalkerCush: HUH
[9:14:14] BigglesVII: @mrbradley503 Different situations warrant higher number of daps
[9:14:16] julho94: lol
[9:14:20] Vikairius: @neekapkilla agreed. The self policing stuff has absolutely destroyed the shift 1 vibe
[9:14:39] Titantrace1: double automatic

[9:14:40] Marl33: We are with you cornwoggles
[9:14:41] SmugPls: Nothing deserves higher number of daps. Especially when meme daps last 60 days. run 1-2 times each week in the PD inside 60 days = Indefinate Suspension BTW LUL
[9:14:53] Socodolo: Socodolo subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[9:14:56] catfish_quackenbush: no put the big one
[9:14:59] Jrey000: @Switchblade142 this one is just straight up lying look at the vod LULW
[9:14:59] ShadowedSeraphim: @PsychoJoker yeah but what  Ssaab thinks and what he does with Slacks are two different things.
[9:15:00] TheHawksTalon: mhm
[9:15:01] shesamaniac: @vikairius I didn't even know it was that bad till other ppl besides Esfand were mentioning it
[9:15:03] SmugPls: If meme daps werent a thing then you can make a case for more daps for 1 instance
[9:15:05] JasonMunday: mhm
[9:15:07] MatStanton: mhm
[9:15:08] JustinBeaver_: 🐴
[9:15:09] Biffus1337: @Neekapkilla yeah. also its not really in character to snitch on ur partner on patrols... ure in lifethreatening situations together. that bonds
[9:15:10] Claxman2000: @Vikairius yup, the vibe is like being a soldier in a dictatorial regime.
[9:15:17] lukeffex: TURBO HELP HANDLING OMFG

[9:15:25] wimdey: I really enjoyed Cornwood hopefully he gets rehired but I doubt it
[9:15:36] Craxxbones: If Koil played Soze, Soze wouldnt last a week in this dept with the Daps they handing out lol
[9:15:37] catfish_quackenbush: put the 88 in the scout and let him try
[9:15:39] icephrogg: ruth and slacks agrees on 5 daps so it wont matter what turner says cornwood will be suspended
[9:15:51] JO3Y_C: Sadge
[9:15:52] iwannanuhh: @icephrogg so cringe
[9:15:57] ShadowedSeraphim: @wimdey its suspended pending review. I doubt he'll get fired
[9:16:04] PsychoJoker: @PsychoJoker yes i understand that. Im just saying he doesnt wanna do it. Im hoping they wait long enough for the other 4 daps to fall off so regardless it only makes it 6 and its only another 24 hour suspension LUL
[9:16:08] 90zs: HeyGuys
[9:16:08] shesamaniac: Suspend the man who has the turbos
[9:16:09] cdarx2: sussy
[9:16:10] miketwng: @iwannanuhh yuh but it's content
[9:16:15] captain_steve_420: I hope the PD falls apart without Cornwood
[9:16:20] BigglesVII: Problem the capts have is they have dap'd for similar situations setting precedence so it puts them in a tough spot for fairness.
[9:16:20] ape2gethrstronge: wait why is cornwood getting 5 daps now??
[9:16:22] TheHawksTalon: Susge
[9:16:22] JustinBeaver_: @icephrogg Burn the PD to the ground if that happens
[9:16:22] Connorbrow: @smugpls Also he was only told to stop after the second magazine. He only fired one bullet after being told to stop.
[9:16:23] thxperiment: Susge why does she need to know
[9:16:26] Karter6t: Turbo help with Torque?
[9:16:26] Kohilenn: cvpis no good uphill
[9:16:33] phaden_: Imagine suspending Cornwood, firing him, then not reimbursing him for the turbos, or the wall silencing. Bruh.
[9:16:35] TheLastRace: The report even says should be charged for Murder. So it doesnt look good
[9:16:40] dreggy69: @PsychoJoker 5 daps for that situation is hilarious if that actually happens
[9:16:42] typicaluser777: @ShadowedSeraphim That's what we thought about Denz but it looks like he will be based on that image shared earlier
[9:16:44] Astral_Rage: like up an incline
[9:16:58] go_kid3: @captain_steve_420 okay...why?
[9:16:58] afghanpsycho: Shes asking you to test it
[9:16:59] catfish_quackenbush: lol still not answering her question
[9:17:00] andrestogas: @captain_steve_420 When is Cornwood leaving the PD?
[9:17:01] TheEmmorf: Shes asking if the Turbos help in the hills
[9:17:01] Biffus1337: @captain_steve_420 100%
[9:17:02] Biggysnipes: hes only half paying attention LUL
[9:17:02] AnusReaktorMan: 6 DAPS total not 5
[9:17:06] Neekapkilla: @BigglesVII Yeah but they aren't consistent at all so yeah. Johnson fired for lying, darola got a DAP or 2 for lying
[9:17:15] mrbradley503: @bigglesvii Sounds like they need to recognize the first mistake and make changes not double down on it.
[9:17:21] dreggy69: @AnusReaktorMan 5 for the sbs situation. not talking about knight
[9:17:24] CopperKat: you should just bring her with you to test
[9:17:26] Pee_aRe: Its crazy cops spend more money on repairs from chasing crims non stop
[9:17:27] TheHawksTalon: Susge 󠀀

[9:30:12] BigglesVII: Ruth is just really strict and by the book. Some real cops have said she is just like captains they have had
[9:30:13] Uses_Profanity: Ruth has a mental of image of how things should be in her own delkuded world and refuses to accept in reality she has no place even having her position tbh.

[9:30:53] Connorbrow: @jrey000 They say that the Mayor has no control over PD, and at the same time say that he's going above their heads. Like it's not possible for both things to be true at the same time.
[9:30:54] 360ski: Sure......
[9:30:54] Felaryn: @EmDuBB13 If Cornwood gets fired since the turbos aren't paid for its technically his property and it would make sense to grab those. Also PD would go on fire Evilge

[11:07:59] kointoss88: I mean Cornwood unintentionally created a hostile work envirnment for her. It was a joke, because he's supposed to be suspicious of everyone who's off-duty, but people heard it, chatters hopped and pushed it too far, and it's actually affected her ability to work.
[11:08:00] Brakon: is cornwood going to put turbos back in the old cars

Archer is a police officer, the whole joke stqrted with her and was as a joke, but some people caught on and actually thought she might do crime or some shit, she finds it annoying how an inside joke became such a problem
[11:13:15] Vikairius: Honestly, Cornwood is great at gathering the evidence and is pretty thorough usually

[12:34:01] cdarx2: act of torture said mental health, which he can only meow now

[14:05:54] RobialT: @splooshtasticals Cornwood show up just to arrest the guy has no other details and now he has to lead a giant case against him where everyone elses reports and provides 90% the evidence
[14:05:57] ItsEdBoi_: Dont think he was ever cuffed
[14:06:10] MahanGM: @afkbrb i know the voice OKEY

[14:06:23] lightwarrior2088: folks been thinking witness testimony from 1 person is enough and not a huge slippery slope is scary
[14:06:23] Leafyerick: The PD doesn't know how and when to apply charges NOWAYING

[14:06:33] MinotaurFluff: uwuNOTE
[14:06:34] Shmoopee: Okay THISS needs to be said in a meeting
[14:06:34] ZachFromChat: In 4.0 he has worded all these charges to actually articulate to put every single crime and charge on each thing.. people are too afraid to stack
[14:06:44] Viccasaur: @w111iam1 very true, I wont in a law enforcement agency , and dashcams and body cams are very helpful
[14:06:49] taraannee: that would be a fast dap lmao

[14:07:15] AnusReaktorMan: So suspending tomorrow?
[14:07:18] slomojosh: pandrax86 I’ve been waiting for another Declan and Cornwood since the last FTO session peepoSad
[14:07:27] moreperfectchan: you guys should be wearing body cams. is that a thing? the prosecutors could cut the footage
[14:07:30] JakeStratic: Yes, please... "He Plead Guilty" should be an acceptable charge @EsfandTV
[14:07:34] ZachFromChat: holy shit thats such good info
[14:07:36] benjono_c8: @Shmoopee Yeah, but its funnier when it goes phone game peepoGiggles
[14:07:36] TheRealStanchez: Bench is not enough, what about a non-guilty plea, then a later appeal?  Need to have a fresh statement or you'll forget by the time the appeal goes to court 2 weeks later.
[14:07:39] kaexium: Chatting
[14:07:44] 1vivy: Create a report called the CORNWOOD OPERATING PROCEDURES full of this stuff hehehe

[14:10:11] afkbrb: @raulc_80 they don't call her daptain ruthless for nothin mhm
[14:10:17] JakeStratic: @Ic3Qu3en Don't pick on the Corn Huskers

[14:10:21] BUTHEDD_: mhm
[14:10:22] Martialcamero7: use a food, football, or gun analogy and it all begins to click for Cornwood
[14:10:25] Leafyerick: @raulc_80 I want to be clear. The person who plays Ruth is fine. Ruth the character is incredibly aggressive when looking at the actions of officers and tries to max out punishments
[14:10:27] raulc_80: @Pandrax86 ohh hahah
[14:10:31] 1vivy: crane based
[14:10:32] splooshtasticals: @D3skT0PLIVE Almost as if they want peeps ill informed or confused sometimes. Its always human error or bad intent that leads to an unjust outcome.
[14:10:38] slomojosh: n
[14:10:39] Shmoopee: @jakestratic SOPs can be changed mhm if the Chief Justice is offering a solution to a notorious problem. maybe we can expect a change
[14:10:39] TheRealStanchez: @taraannee Officers still need to articulate the charges of the incident, which requires knowledge of the laws that are applicable and how to state it properly
[14:10:39] Blazin_Tachi: mhm
[14:10:47] slomojosh: mhm

[14:10:57] Ic3Qu3en: @JakeStratic i live in nebraska, im allowed lmao
[14:10:58] ip33fr331y: hopefully this leads to Cornwood enjoying more time being a great cop and not worrying so much about the paperwork. :-)

[14:11:14] raemers: NOTED
[14:11:26] BigglesVII: @TheRealStanchez Yeah simply covering points to prove for each offence.
[14:11:26] sporratt: Is this the bar exam?
[14:11:27] Pandrax86: @Leafyerick True, but a lot of times, Ruth isn't even dapping people, Ssaab is the one who really makes the decision. He was given the keys to the PD for NP4.0
[14:11:29] splooshtasticals: mhm i enjoy it
[14:11:30] taraannee: @TheRealStanchez ya thats why im saying it isnt "real simple" like crane is saying, they dont get trained like lawyers they should get help on this
[14:11:32] MinotaurFluff: really getting that Esq
[14:11:34] ZachFromChat: mhm  this is the info we've been begging for
[14:11:39] D3skT0P__: @D3skT0PLIVE but that becomes an argument of either that "character" is doing so for selfish reasons or OOC, and thats always a blurred line unless X person knows X person

[14:14:28] PrivateSyaz: It might be that a detaied report is useful for the PD itself looking it up in the future but an "Additional Info" section would work for that

[14:14:45] JakeStratic: @Shmoopee Yes, Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)s are not meant to be changed... but it doesn't happen from one conversation. It should be simple but this PD/Server leadership is HIGHLY bureaucratic.

[14:20:01] HeyMeghan: @afkbrb yeah idk. there seems to be a lot of confusion when it comes to chief and sheriff. council thinks they get to appointment a chief. captains think it’s their choice to make the guidelines etc. it’s a dadgum shitshow lol

[14:20:23] funkie: Crane stream?
[14:20:24] TheRealStanchez: You already knew all that though (make reports right to the point), it's more an issue of getting the rest of the PD SOPs on board with it
[14:20:24] sunohonmy: its simple, but the pd aint allowed to do it that simply, cuz they could get in trouble with superiors OMEGALUL
[14:20:25] Pandrax86: @EsfandTV Have you talked to the devs about being given an admin role for the server? you're practically doing it, just without the power. lol

[14:20:33] hammamer: people need to sue the pd sometimes that's why you write everything
