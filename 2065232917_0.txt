[2:15:55] Thallo_Auxo: There's ems, doctors, lawyers, judges and lots more
[2:16:01] meowmexxx: in general, i am new. i didnt know if there is a lot
[2:16:24] meowmexxx: I knew about those, thank you, what is lots more?
[2:16:29] Thallo_Auxo: Really you can be anything
[2:16:45] meowmexxx: would it make sense to be military or IT?
[2:17:08] Forser: meowmexxx, There are jobs as sanitation worker, tow driver, mechanic, delivery person, security personal for G6 (Money transfers), Doctors, EMS, Dispatch, Fast Food .. that's some of it
[2:17:12] kernalflock: Classic
[2:17:37] meowmexxx: @Forser Thank you so much!
[2:17:54] Forser: meowmexxx, Your welcome.
[2:17:58] Thallo_Auxo: The police act as military as military isn't really needed Kapp but you can be IT, it's all about RPing it out
[2:18:25] meowmexxx: I see, thank you im new to all of this and love it
[2:18:42] Forser: Yeah, of course as Thallo says, you can RP any work really but if you are talking about jobs with in-game mechanics, those i listed are some of them
[2:19:01] Thallo_Auxo: Quite a few jobs have all been created by someone role playing it out
[2:21:15] Thallo_Auxo: Eg, I can remember who but someone RPed being a car salesman at PDM. They were so good that devs later added some mechanics to make their job easier and to help with their RP
[2:21:21] meowmexxx: I see, i would like to do a few things, just wondering how youd get paid doing it, so you wont be broke all the time ahha idk i gues ill have to try it out
[2:21:53] Thallo_Auxo: People can hand over money
[2:22:20] meowmexxx: ok for services. thanks!
[2:23:01] Forser: One even ran a Tarot reading company in 3.0, no mechanics at all. It was really good and provided a lot of roleplay and entertainment.
[2:23:41] romdall1: merryweather and legalized class 2s NODDERS
[2:24:50] Thallo_Auxo: Ooo she was great! She used an actual tarot deck and sometimes she would stream her desk while she did a reading and laid out the cards
[2:26:15] Thallo_Auxo: Also, Ryan was also a prolific dietician
[2:26:20] williamwellwood: where on Vespucci lol
[2:26:56] Thallo_Auxo: It's pronounced vespooky
[2:27:15] Forser: One char that evolved a lot during 2.0 and 3.0 was someone named Matt Rhodes. Went from recycling coke cans (and not peddling drugs) into a owner of a recycling center into being a cop. It's insane what RP can do :P
