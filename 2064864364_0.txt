[2:09:39] OnyxSpartanII: one or two bad tows could be mistakes, but past that seems kinda intentional nodd

[2:11:23] ghosttpipes: monkaHmm what does it mean
[2:12:29] SirBabelt: So cops can just overcharge and say "your case gets handled in 14 days, good luck doing nothing untill then" and the inevitable lawsuit is paid from the abstract "PD budjet"
[2:18:50] bruhkewl: still think the class of felony might be a good balance
[2:19:05] goldrite: I mean shouldn't stuff like that just be forced onto the docket?

[4:52:52] mystic_drewman: I wish the meters had a green or red light to tell if it's paid or not
[4:54:11] mystic_drewman: Just a small little light
[4:56:01] DeterNET: I think you can spawn a particle emiter that does light
[4:56:01] SirBabelt: Or just increase the distance you can interact with the meters
[4:56:27] theconvictedquokka: Or light on when not paid light off when not
[4:56:30] mystic_drewman: Exactly what I was thinking just to drive by as a tow truck driver to see from the truck
[4:57:12] SirBabelt: I think the problem with that is, the meters are usually behind the parked car so it need to be REALLY visible
[4:57:45] SirBabelt: But the light thing sounds feasible
[4:59:31] Alderain971: why not both?
