[3:03:08] caelixxtv: YAPPP she hopped chars must be dodging K
[3:03:09] fubbes_93: i feel like snitching on other gangs is ok. it sucs for some character though because cops still treat them like their 3.0 characters(criminals) and others get the benefit of "being a civ"

[3:03:48] Khaza_: @fubbes_93 CG went out hunting. He was actively doing something criminal.
[3:03:48] TheWhiteWillow94: if you want to spin a narrative to the police the only way it will work is if you include mostly truths shdiHeh just straight up lying to PD wont get you anywhere
[3:03:50] PsychoBKilla: The same thing would've happened to Mary if she got caught with a gun
[3:03:51] Isen_Mage: he could have done what Mary did. Give the gun to someone that can take the fall
[3:03:55] NotBetsy: yeah I can see that
[3:03:55] scarlettx_: nodd
[3:03:59] BakinPacman: he played f around and find out games LUL
[3:04:01] BVNISH: K getting caught is just FAFO IMO
[3:04:03] tigerland06: Shy Rusty
[3:04:06] EvadableMoxie: Mary works with the PD, CG tweet out saying they want Captains to die.  At a certain point,  what do you expect?
[3:04:06] illifis: And the PD took a logical action by frisking K and checking to see what weapon he had.
[3:04:07] RoyLeeTV: they can also dna trace that gun
[3:04:07] tedium7: FAFO
[3:04:09] rmcgowan: New chatters need to understand that very few characters suffered from cops not perceiving them as a civilian more than Mary. They went insanely hard on her.
[3:04:11] neonishere32: you feeling better Kylie?
[3:04:15] FIunkifer: @purplepoodle89 bro its fictional cops and gangs, hope you can understand that one day
[3:04:20] Soov: WHAT MARY IS GONNA GET CG ON HER COP AND JAIL THEM ON THEIR JUDGE CHARACTER? WHAT
[3:04:21] Sealclaw: IMO, if you don't want the past to be held against you, you should've made another character Shrug You chose to play the same character, with everythng that comes with it
[3:04:22] zachps: It was a little wild when K got shot the cops just didnt bother chasing anyone tbh
[3:04:23] Vadoctrax: Mosley's Panto Emporium

[3:05:10] ThePitfallover: I think chatters have bought into the "the gun was planted" story too much, and forget K ACTUALLY did that shit kyliebLul
[3:05:15] greatmuta2: Mary literally got handcuffed and arrested while repairing her car with no pretense just "she's sus"
[3:05:17] rmcgowan: Mary getting raided for a lower bar, getting actually inventory wiped, cops not returning any of the stuff that was not related to the crime for 60+ days, keeping millions of dollars of GNE and not returning it. It was pretty bad
[3:05:18] zenatr: Don't do the damn crimes if you don't wanna deal with the outcome LUL
[3:05:20] DabneyCollins: I think CG got used to having the PD in their pocket in 3.0
[3:05:21] BeardedCaveMan_TV: think this is more about the council treating his stuff as criminal on top of what happened
[3:05:27] Boltaction_Babe: classic tattoo id
[3:05:27] Fr0stwav3: KEKW bruh the police stole MILLIONS off of Mary and just never returned it

[4:57:24] Vadoctrax: When Angel went on duty, the smart crims didn't do crime
[4:57:25] tigerland06: If you're talking about the cop thing, they know Angel is a judge now and you have Letty. If Angel was jobless they'd want her too.

[4:59:14] PsychoBKilla: Also I love the soft tone that you use on Angel
[4:59:17] ViolentAkuma: Brock is great
[4:59:18] tigerland06: Brock is disarming, Angel was harsh.
[4:59:19] KaraSnee: CG would run when angel is back as a cop LUL
[4:59:21] rmcgowan: But yeah, I absolutely adore Brock and love seeing her around
[4:59:23] eborcurean: The best thing about Angel as judge is she will hold cops and crims accountable, and cops know that they can't slide things past her
[4:59:29] klugklug: angel and ruth would probably be good friends
[4:59:49] shpuddie: nodd

[5:08:49] dume5330: not overreacting
[5:08:51] PsychoBKilla: This is just the start
[5:08:52] Abi45x: You're not overreacting at all
[5:08:52] shpuddie: it makes sense it might get worse
[5:08:52] BORAT_VERYNICE: no you arent over reacting

[5:08:59] klugklug: its still hella scary
[5:09:01] ThePitfallover: it's the spirit of the law imo
[5:09:02] Sahneee: YEP
[5:09:03] Sonaro8: its not about this one specific bill, its what comes after
[5:09:03] PsychoBKilla: They are gonna start pushing more bullshit
[5:09:03] dume5330: no
[5:09:03] DaeDae87: It's the first of many rights to be removed
[5:09:04] ibruticus: The people with power having thoughts like that is bad bad
[5:09:04] illifis: I think its a valid reaction
[5:09:04] spicychickenzz: no you're not
[5:09:05] Soov: it builds ground to get worse
[5:09:05] ViolentAkuma: It still has to pass the house or something right?
[5:09:06] kaothe3rd: it will get worse sadly
[5:09:06] kirbee_star: I mean it starts as that, but I doubt it is the end
[5:09:07] itaraa1043: YEP
[5:09:08] miicrowv: YEP
[5:09:08] TheZYgnar: its a sign of what's to come
[5:09:09] Ara_Memnoch: doesnt matter to the politicians, right
[5:09:09] Seanisms: I think its the principal of it
[5:09:09] Morningstarter: it's the first step into much worse things
[5:09:09] mugcostanza: it's not far fetched to think that
[5:09:10] ben0809: YEP
[5:09:11] Boltaction_Babe: Yeah this is just the start
[5:09:11] KewlKittyProductions: it does matter though
[5:09:11] ToToTJM: its a stepping stone to other bills against trans people
[5:09:11] yeehaw_x: it will get worse
[5:09:11] candorus: That's not an over reaction and you're not crazy
[5:09:13] Vadoctrax: The ones who passed it know exactly what they're doing and why they're targetting it.
[5:09:13] BlightSpeaker26: better to get out before it does get worse
[5:09:13] Gemcity5: Definitely be concerned. But it's also a law that does not have the power to be enforced.
[5:09:14] drewliet: its usually like the first step to see what they can get away with
[5:09:14] kingcloudii: no youre not crazy, she MAY be right, but it doesnt stop the crazies
[5:09:15] PsychoBKilla: Me personally, I would dip
[5:09:15] Fr0stwav3: its the snowball at the top of the hill nodd
[5:09:16] NotToTheFace: I think any law which empowers bigots in bathrooms is worth moving for
[5:09:16] bwehn: yeah thats a whistle being blown as a sign to get out
[5:09:17] Coognut: that law is just the start
[5:09:18] Qyuyu: It's definitely gonna get worse
[5:09:18] AFlickedBean: It's a bad direction
[5:09:18] DeadpanZak: better safe than sorry who knows what else they pass
[5:09:18] Rex__84: The State is saying that YOU are not welcome
[5:09:18] ViolentAkuma: Oh shit
[5:09:18] Coognut: exactly
[5:09:18] BORAT_VERYNICE: thats just the first domino, its not like nothing else is going to happen after that
[5:09:19] eborcurean: Just because the canary in the mine fell over and you feel fine is not a reason to stay down there
[5:09:19] HotCocoaGamer: I mean sure its just for government buildings or whatever but what they wanna do is quite clear.
[5:09:20] rmcgowan: You are not overreacting. Every SINGLE STATE that has started down this path has passed additional bills to make the situation worse. EVERY. SINGLE. ONE.
[5:09:20] poppins1729: Agreed, the intent behind it
[5:09:20] mugcostanza: kyliebCozylove
[5:09:21] BlueDawnFFS: yeah shwe just dont want you to move away from her
[5:09:22] Zydonian: Yeah you're not overreacting, sadly Sadge
[5:09:22] TumNarDok: youll never get a liberal govt in utah who would take the law back
[5:09:22] ViolentAkuma: That sucks
[5:09:22] Kazirim: Kazirim subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 32 months! 
[5:09:23] shpuddie: they also legally redifined what gender is, its a bad start
[5:09:23] BlightSpeaker26: its certainly not gonna get better
[5:09:23] neonishere32: I think it’s a mix of doom and dooming
[5:09:24] Sufficate: its kinda saying your not welcome
[5:09:26] DabneyCollins: It shows that they don't consider trans people to be equal citizens, which means that they have no problem passing further draconian shit
[5:09:26] RatBrick: it's pretty fucked up. Watching from Australia has been crazy
[5:09:26] AverageBritishWhiteBoy: I think she just wants you to be close, she might be downplaying it cause she wants you close
[5:09:26] straykiddelta: transphobes dont really care if you actually already had surgery
[5:09:27] spicychickenzz: its the first step to 'othering'
[5:09:28] ViolentAkuma: Sorry
[5:09:30] Chronophylos: It doesnt matter if you're overreacting. What matters is that you do not feel safe
[5:09:31] infamous_butcher: It's the first step they're taking
[5:09:34] mugcostanza: kyliebHype
[5:09:34] Vadoctrax: Even if it gets overturned, they still did it and will continue to do it.
[5:09:35] sievers: It's dangerous to stay
[5:09:35] Blake2493: its a fucked up first step. its totally normal to react how you are
[5:09:36] PsychoBKilla: They showed their true colors with this
[5:09:36] Ara_Memnoch: i wouold definitely start saving for a trip away
[5:09:37] ThePitfallover: waiting until the proverbial "roundup" is a good way to fuck yourself over
[5:09:38] HotCocoaGamer: Its one of those bills that makes their intentions clear.
[5:09:41] ben0809: time to go texas KKona
[5:09:44] Nighseven: Crazy? deffinily not, still there may be hope for the future Sadge
[5:09:44] mugcostanza: ye
[5:09:46] candorus: The state is saying you are less of a person which is fucked up
[5:09:46] Sonaro8: this one thing is just the tip of the iceberg, at the very minimum id expect you to be aiming to leave even if you dont do it soonish
[5:09:46] footmunched: Very much the thin end of the wedge
[5:09:48] illifis: Also, isnt there some stipulation about birth certificates that also needs to be met?
[5:09:48] Dirt_Grub_: Your tax dollars contribute to a bigoted state government. Leave
[5:09:49] kingcloudii: what about the next law? thats the problem
[5:09:52] RaspberryJr: In my state I can only use gender neutral bathrooms.
[5:09:52] Sahneee: @ben0809, Awkward
[5:09:52] Darkri19: just because you can prepare to move does not mean you have to long term ^
[5:09:53] Matrix8369: That law is only the tip of whats coming though
[5:09:54] SirRagnas: living in Texas sucks.
[5:09:54] mugcostanza: it's a stepping stone type law
[5:09:56] TheWhiteWillow94: Just go one state over to Colorado so you're still close to family but can feel safer nodd
[5:09:57] SirRagnas: Trust me.
[5:09:59] BORAT_VERYNICE: plus if you don't feel safe....
[5:10:01] id10T_T: It's about the implications
[5:10:01] Boltaction_Babe: They are just gonna make it worse as time goes
[5:10:03] ibruticus: Their thinking is already going a certain way with passnig that
[5:10:08] PsychoBKilla: Washington is beautiful
[5:10:08] bwehn: that law just makes it easier to pass the next restrictive law
[5:10:08] ben0809: @Sahneee staree

[5:10:55] Arthazz95: Can bully Luna pogg
[5:10:58] rmcgowan: It declares intent. They want to piece by piece establish that they have the right to erode your right to exist. Fuck them. Get out.

[5:11:03] footmunched: Isn't Nakkida in Washington too?

[5:11:08] infamous_butcher: Washington seems like a cool state.
[5:11:08] Pyromanen15: the only counter point is that leaving is giving the hateful people behind the law what they want, but i dont think you're overreacting either
[5:11:12] candorus: wouldn't surprise me
[5:11:14] neonishere32: then you sell it in 10 years

[5:11:58] Soov: @neonishere32 the bald one
[5:12:00] Ara_Memnoch: it is a pressing matter, understandable to dwell on it
[5:12:01] eborcurean: @ToToTJM some of them have literally said that
[5:12:02] jc_sh4llow: jc_sh4llow subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months! 
[5:12:06] candorus: Despairge
[5:12:09] Gemcity5: The law that passed doesnt have the power to be enforced by law enforcement
[5:12:13] 3tacosintheriver: That would be horrible
[5:12:15] ThePitfallover: i DOUBT it gets to that point
[5:12:15] Matrix8369: put the prop in a trust
[5:12:17] drewliet: nopixel training you for asset seizure
[5:12:19] Atdr52: Despairge

[5:12:25] klugklug: nodd
[5:12:26] dume5330: i thikn that would need a federal law which isn't happening, ,but they can make it difficult to be a homeowner
[5:12:33] Kotaro_M: ok, understand nothing. gl whatever you guys are taliking about
[5:12:35] Misui: america seems like a real weird place with those laws
[5:12:35] rmcgowan: Ehh, property law is really hard to get around. You could set up a holding company or LLC to get around those issues.
[5:12:36] Soov: i'd just dip, honestly
[5:12:36] neonishere32: I think that’s pre dooming
[5:12:37] kaothe3rd: i'd be most worried about the next upcoming election and what repubs would do if they got into office
[5:12:38] czhilli: it's a hostile environment - get away
[5:12:40] shpuddie: better to be somewhere where you dont have that kind of worry nodd
[5:12:41] eborcurean: @Gemcity5 people are already being harassed, a cis girl at a basketball game had someone demanding she was 'inspected'
[5:12:46] nuiker: november is going to be pretty telling on the future I think

[5:15:03] rmcgowan: Run the numbers. If the house pays for itself AND generates enough revenue to pay for rent in your new home that means it makes sense to keep it. The way the market in SLC is exploding just waiting five years to sell the house could mean you make enough money to buy a house in the Seattle Area
