[8:27:15] 0ctember: it kind of seemed like the judges misheard Pal Gore's testimony. They found him guilty because they said he admitted it, but he didn't
[8:27:16] FattyPneumonia: someone has to sacrifice themselves and get him with a rifle
[8:27:16] boolove: @bionerdgames the standard doesnt change i.e., the actual burden but whether or not a judge is convinced it rises to that level can vary depending on whether theyre convinced of the proof
[8:27:18] heko___07: Pal gore was an innocent man.. just misunderstood
