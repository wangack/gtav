[1:00:09] whistlndixie: @ChiyekoLive yup, its a limo
[1:00:09] PettyGamingYT: LA
[1:00:11] KarliCartoons: The worst part about LA is that we HAVE the resources and space to take care of and house the unhoused and our local government doesn't do anything about it.
[1:00:17] bypha: isnt there a huge chance that most homeless people are out of state? they only got there because of the weather?

[1:00:43] ggman0881: You should do a charity stream for cancer research.
[1:00:50] demonicpossum666: never understood that. homelessness is bad because its bad for the people going through it not because its against my aesthetic lmaoooo weirdos
[1:00:53] VECTORIUSpt: the house prices is insane, all around the world, people have to unite about the basics

[1:01:39] KarliCartoons: NODDERS
[1:01:42] supraza: LA politicians
[1:01:43] Cabbagepatchclown_: ya I think la has spent more on antihomeless infastructure than it would cost to provide housing for them
[1:01:45] kylie_diehl: how they supposed to find him it he’s moving
[1:01:45] extrasoapyhands: Stats have shown that it actually costs cities more to enable homelessness than it does to simply home the people. It's a choice that costs us money
[1:01:52] DeathstrokeTBA: I live in a country where the unemployment rate is close to 50% and I see homeless people everywhere, and here they accost you at the traffic lights, it's not a pleasant sight, and can be scary at times, I don't know how bad it is in LA
[1:01:52] a1_flyinghigh: @spaceboy i got another 3,000 burning a hole in my wallet!!!
[1:01:54] pinky_and_brainiac: Smh
[1:01:54] somecontainer52: is the fire lane as safe as the sidewalk? i don't think its as save as the road
[1:01:57] SanDeggo: @Spaceboy But how to I make money off of helping homeless people? Kappa
[1:02:01] Cadneetwopointoh: Billions spent on the homeless "problem"
[1:02:02] xSloppyGravyx: DADDY RANDAL !!!!
[1:02:02] Minato_in_Texas: I wonder if there's a charity related to Ankylosing spondylitis
[1:02:04] icecreamcats: it’s about keeping those in charge in the spot and anyone else below them
[1:02:05] TheMythicBunny: there's helicopters out there now patrolling bc of how many people are lookin'
[1:02:09] RARA_cht: The hidden james is the deadliest
[1:02:11] crosseyed221: its free so write a valentines card to the cancer kids pls
[1:02:19] PettyGamingYT: hello i am a poor
[1:02:20] razzimov: BorpaScoots
[1:02:21] palebychoice: It's a shame that LA's housing first solutions have probably had some of the worst outcomes in the country. Other cities have had success, but I think it also just shows how the scope of the problem is just so much worse in CA
[1:02:21] hemithgg: Did you see Overwatch is doing a crossover with Cowboy Bebop?

[1:03:25] goose_with_socks: where I live is having a massive uptick in the homeless population because the neighboring towns and cities are being gentrified. it’s causing their homeless population to move into my town and people who lived in those towns and cities to become homeless. it’s a terrible vicious cycle…
