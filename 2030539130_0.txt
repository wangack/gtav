[5:35:41] Madam_Orange: can you just put stuff in the pallet first and then put it in the truck?
[5:35:52] Madam_Orange: like while holding it?
[5:36:10] Thrath: As long as it only spawns 1 log from it yeah Orange
[5:36:32] Anrisacia: So if you fill the trunk with the medium pallets (you can fit 6), you could realistically do runs of 720 planks
[5:36:35] Madam_Orange: might make processing easier at least
[5:36:44] Madam_Orange: instead of putting it all on the ground
[5:37:01] inus2: 720 planks is.. like 2160 at 3$/ea?
[5:37:15] Anrisacia: Oh wait sorry
[5:37:20] Anrisacia: 240 planks
[5:37:31] Anrisacia: For some reason thought each log gave 15 planks lol
[5:37:31] Madam_Orange: kivaLUL
[5:38:00] inus2: yeah was gonna say the lumber mill seems quiet today, otherwise I would imagine there would be a huge crowd kivaLUL
[5:38:02] Madam_Orange: thats if you had a trunk full of them
[5:38:10] Thrath: On average 600-750 per run
[5:38:23] Anrisacia: 240 for 6 medium pallets, 480 for the high
[5:38:28] inus2: well also by the time you would have 6 of the medium your rep would presumably be high enough to have the big one already
[5:38:30] Random_Slacker: with these pallets.. it even makes sense doing this job with someone.. the other person could do the inventory management
[5:38:41] TKE_Super_Dave: It also looks like you can hold multiple in the truck too.

[5:39:11] venkaramon: Did lumber jack get an upgrade?
[5:39:41] inus2: anri's 480 number is for the big one
[5:39:45] inus2: 240 for yours if you had all of them
[5:39:50] squoogelol: if my math is right it would take 20 runs to make your money back
[5:39:51] Anrisacia: Yeah 480 if you had 6 of the high load pallets
[5:39:52] discardedDigit: Pallets seem to make it a lot easier to do lumber in a group as well.
[5:40:21] Anrisacia: $4800
[5:40:21] inus2: @discardedDigit yeah thats what  Iwas thinking also, its way less punishing to bring a friend
[5:40:36] SavageAnimals: Technically you are getting more rep also right?
[5:40:43] SavageAnimals: less time driving
[5:40:47] Thrath: Yeah more rep since more logs needed to fill
[5:40:50] Madam_Orange: if you had a full group of 6 you could just have everyone fill up one pallet
[5:41:49] Anrisacia: They seem to be adding stuff to Axel pretty consistently too, so never know what might be added next
[5:41:56] Figueronie: theres more work at the stations and cutting the trees itself but the 5 less trips helps so much
[5:42:16] discardedDigit: Earlier in the day when you tried to buy the pallet, you couldn't because you had 1 extra kg in your backpack inventory.
[5:42:45] wizardiis: kivaDesk
[5:43:01] inus2: @Anrisacia with the ability to move that much lumber at once in a truck, im starting to wonder what new blueprints will require wood-wise. "1000 planks" or something kivaLUL
[5:43:41] venkaramon: Does lumberjack actually conflict with the jobs of the others?
[5:44:03] venkaramon: Is it blue or green?
[5:44:33] inus2: think its blue
[5:44:34] Anrisacia: Yeah you would probably see a problem where there would be nothing but low quality trees if only higher quality wood were used since no one would be chopping them down
[5:44:39] inus2: its the same color as sani iirc
[5:45:46] TKE_Super_Dave: So I'm wondering if in the future the trees that Axel sells will be able to be cut down for higher quality wood but you have to plant and grow them first.
[5:46:09] opalducky: So are you carrying more in the truck now?
[5:46:24] Madam_Orange: NODDERS
[5:46:53] inus2: @opalducky it carries 800 kg by itself for the medium, a guy named wyatt showed her the big one and it carries 1600 kg
[5:47:33] opalducky: Cool kivaAwh
[5:47:33] Thrath: Would help in mass carrying from machine to machine
[5:47:36] venkaramon: Is the big one rep locked?
