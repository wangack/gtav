[0:12:34] laaazylemon: honest question, do you think 3 captains are enough for all that work?
[0:12:36] Thraxton1: Wait Watt is straight up lying, Cornwood never agreed with K on his opinions of the other officers right? He was just trying to keep things moving but he never badmouthed anyone

[1:52:09] moneywayceejay: You have zero discipline in the ranks
[1:52:09] ItsAHazardLife: It does matter though cause that scene was one sided and the other side still needs to be looked into.
[1:52:10] homiebear17: just enjoy the rp man its not comp game
[1:52:11] totalusxox: Didnt Tommy T get blooded into CG?

[1:52:47] RegulatorTTV: I watch other streams definitely lack of discipline
[1:52:47] TheApatheticMike: i think cg feel like they are getting treated unfairly when they think theres no investigation into mary or yaegar
[1:52:48] kotidestroyer: some decisions are not the wisest, thats it
[1:52:51] Thewildth1ng: it’s the bias of 3.0 that has made people’s opinions of 4.0 characters already
[1:52:53] Lorflin: out of curiosity are the other party being actively investigated though?

[3:04:22] IIIIIIIlllIIllIIII: cant believe cops got an invis ability to use in shootouts crims are fucked
[3:04:23] spartacus1j: @bamz5 Is it saturday?
[3:04:31] Artsii1994: @arcayda evidence is here and a virtual reality to go back to the scese to see what happened its still a work in progress
[3:04:31] DezalbM: courtrooms really need there projectors back after this
[3:04:33] portuguegangsta: Imagine if they just took proper pictures lol
[3:04:35] T3aBags: Give cops more power, no issues Kappa
[3:04:43] SpectreUK: would be nice if when in the VR you can draw a line from firing point to the impact
[3:04:48] BulletGorilla: why would you need pictures. you can make video of vr
[3:04:48] ForgottenJones: Scene control is crucial
[3:04:50] doodiefactory: cop server Kappa
[3:04:51] d4wson21: how long you streaming for today
[3:04:55] bamz5: @spartacus1j no, but blau was saying something about virtual laboratory im guessing it is
[3:05:04] lookingfornothinghere: you could even take screenshots in VR and use paint to show the tracer of the projectils
[3:05:12] Alekdk1: wait what is this VR chat? Are they able to play in VR?
[3:05:20] T3aBags: Surely chop will pay more than 500 and hr then Kappa

[3:05:39] robertsmithjr: the amount of complaining about something that doesnt effect us chatters come on guys its improvements for the server and thats not a bad thing
[3:05:47] MomSaiditsMyTurnOnDaXbox: @Alekdk1 yes, PD now has to ERP in VR to conduct investigations

[3:06:20] portuguegangsta: Can crimms pick up their casings? That would be a fair balance to this.
[3:06:25] shadowsnake1985: @doodiefactory definitely not when cops have been robbed at knife point and instead of pulling their guns out and shooting the robbers they go with the Rp
[3:06:28] msdeell: gloves
[3:06:29] ELEGlGGLE: fishh LastTimeChatter

[3:06:37] Stackswyd: Clap an an s did a fantastic job
[3:06:39] Artsii1994: So the flash.ight van see the casings that are put on the ground to see the casings thats cool
[3:06:39] Vitrake: "oh no my favorite streamers crim character could go to jail for 5 mins IRL time now easier with this mechanic, how will I ever survive" LUL
[3:06:39] impulsivetomato: shouldn't these mechanics be announced like in a big ass meeting? or do the captains need to tell this to every officer now?
[3:06:42] dakota22446: LULE
[3:06:44] reichenbachs: crims dont be sloppy dumbfucks who just shoot will nilly
[3:06:45] Firsthandpower: This is so cool. People who are saying it's op are dumb because the cops still need the bullet casings and evidence who was there etc. They still need to police
[3:06:45] SykoOGs: OMEGALAUGHING SNOW
[3:06:46] ForgottenJones: @uhSnow Truuuuue
[3:06:49] Eddie1225: ITS A RP SERVER NOT A CSGO MATCH

[3:06:54] Alekdk1: @uhsnow that is simply just rp chat tho lmao
[3:06:56] xRethe: are crims able to see their own casings now and pick them up? That'd be cool
[3:06:56] DezalbM: can non PD use a flashlight to do this as well?
[3:07:02] robertsmithjr: thank you @Eddie1225

[3:07:33] char69: cuff. search, and arrest all suspects :)
[3:07:36] marneraiders: It isn’t OP because crimes know from where they shot. PD doesn’t so they need to have it easier to see the casings.
[3:07:46] datascribe: @impulsivetomato I think that is what is happening
[3:07:47] xRethe: @Eddie1225 that's cool, glad to see that level of depth come through
[3:07:50] reichenbachs: @T3aBags, nah more time for cops to RP instead of making reports/taking screenshots etc
[3:07:50] samealb: can crims pick up the projectiles?
[3:07:51] TheTourist_: wideduckass
[3:07:57] lookingfornothinghere: @T3aBags yes please get whitelisted and do the work of collecting the evidence like 3.0 seemed really fun for the PD
[3:07:59] impulsivetomato: datascribe which one? :D
[3:08:02] Eddie1225: @T3aBags ok so if this wasn't in would you mid if your streamer was in the cells for 30+ mins while they document shit?
[3:08:03] Eddie1225: OMEGALAUGHING
[3:08:03] Afoool: @Eddie1225 wats wrong with cs?
[3:08:06] uhSnow: auto pickup is awesome, can't wait to try it ingame

[3:08:07] occams_cha1nsaw: @samealb not yet soon
[3:08:15] Eddie1225: this litteraly helps everyone
[3:08:16] Eddie1225: crims included
[3:08:19] uhSnow: @Eddie1225 great point
[3:08:20] Eddie1225: less time in the cells
[3:08:23] datascribe: @impulsivetomato showing them 1-2 at the time after meeting
[3:08:24] lucidious_fox: We need a seperate forensic team. I don't think PD should do everything. They will be exhausted
[3:08:25] WundertueteGER: Pog
[3:08:29] Eddie1225: if thats what they want
[3:08:31] ForgottenJones: Hmmm
[3:08:35] uhSnow: @T3aBags refer to the second part of my last message, we're gamers not actual cops
[3:08:37] Pichoto: isnt that broken? that the PD can go back thousands times to the same place to get more and more details?
[3:08:38] impulsivetomato: @datascribe oof :(

[3:08:56] Firsthandpower: Literally they are gamers not cops chill its rp
[3:09:01] ForgottenJones: sniper
[3:09:04] impulsivetomato: Pichoto I think in 3.0 it vanished after time not sure now
[3:09:11] Alekdk1: “Yeah you have to wait like 10-20 weeks need to pick up the evidence”
[3:09:19] uhSnow: oh that's sick
[3:09:21] uhSnow: love the map
[3:09:25] marneraiders: @pichoto why, it’s like recreating something in a Map. Police already uses 3 D Scans at some scenes.
[3:09:30] ForgottenJones: lesgo
[3:09:31] Myki_Cameda: Each 'scene' would have it's own report# to center the VR on
[3:09:34] apinguisgaming: you can fly there
[3:09:49] sagezz1: the map the map the map the map the maaap!
[3:09:51] WitchKingTron: its a CSGO match RAGEY
[3:09:51] wavep987: @ssaab VR could be linked from the map so VR goes to that scene.
[3:09:53] ForgottenJones: wow
[3:09:55] uhSnow: @T3aBags are you new to this?
[3:09:57] lookingfornothinghere: could you technically fly there? @Ssaab even if its not the same location
[3:09:59] portuguegangsta: Adding a mechanic where crim side code "clean up a scene" would be cool. Opens the door for "Cleaner Crews" who clean up a scene and clean up blood casings etc. Would be pretty neat extenstion of RP
[3:10:04] datascribe: Rush B donkAim
[3:10:08] Alekdk1: “cops get too much stuff. It’s gonna be so hard for the crims now kebunPalm ”

[3:10:28] StreamElements: What they said saabThat
[3:10:34] lookingfornothinghere: chatters didnt watch 3.0 PD spending literal hours picking up evidence and sorting it

[3:10:52] Firsthandpower: @alekdk1 lmfaooooo right on the nose

[7:37:23] GlitchyGunZ: crims got all the power over cops and people just want crims to run wild kill everybody and takeover. I get it people like violence and root for bad guys that’s what it is

[7:37:48] buddha_hands: @seanlew123 so he couldnt fight it, which is the cause of the uproar
[7:38:04] BadRabbits: @GlitchyGunZ if X mained a cop, everyone's opinion on cops would change like THAT
[7:38:05] seanlew123: game is so different now its weird
[7:38:11] r_kol: @seanlew123 Email her and do what? She doesnt believe shes in the wrong. He is getting another prespective

[7:38:55] seanlew123: the charges
[7:39:18] buddha_hands: @seanlew123 well it's too late now.. suarez baited him to turn himself in & since the people who put the warrant out weren't around, he can only appeal what's there now
[7:39:22] Alekdk1: If he emails Ruth he’s gonna get this back “If you aren’t satisfied go through the appeal process.”
[7:39:30] r_kol: @buddha_hands Yep
[7:39:33] seanlew123: thank u all so much
[7:39:33] GlitchyGunZ: A lot of people ride the crims and jumping on their train. For the most part as short staffed as they are they do a decent job. people expect perfection. they are human too
[7:39:49] tmdanny: Isn't this is what wrangler use to do? Did shotty work to arrest people and let them deal with an appeal later?

[8:50:46] Artsii1994: You know they say that all men are created equal, but you look at me and you look at Samoa Joe and you can see that statement is not true. See, normally if you go one on one with another wrestler, you got a 50/50 chance of winning. But I’m a genetic freak and I’m not normal! So you got a 25%, AT BEST, at beat me. Then you add Kurt Angle to the mix, your chances of winning drastic go down. See the 3 way at Sacrifice, you got a 33 1/3 chance of winning, but I, I got a 66 and 2/3 chance of winning
[8:50:50] dakota22446: SteinerMath HES FAT

[8:53:05] MsFreya_x: DankThink
[8:53:14] Eddie1225: because Kurt Angle KNOWS he can't beat me and he's not even gonna try! So Samoa Joe, you take your 33 1/3 chance, minus my 25% chance and you got an 8 1/3 chance of winning at Sacrifice. But then you take my 75% chance of winning, if we was to go one on one, and then add 66 2/3 per cents, I got 141 2/3 chance of winning at Sacrifice. See Joe, the numbers don't lie, and they spell disaster for you at Sacrifice.

See, normally if you go one on one with another wrestler, you got a 50/50 chance of winning. But I'm a genetic freak and I'm not normal! So you got a 25%, AT BEST, at beat me. Then you add Kurt Angle to the mix, your chances of winning drastic go down. See the 3 way at Sacrifice, you got a 33 1/3 chance of winning, but I, I got a 66 and 2/3 chance of winning

Then you add Kurt Angle to the mix, your chances of winning drastic go down. See the 3 way at Sacrifice, you got a 33 1/3 chance of winning, but I, I got a 66 and 2/3 chance of winning

[14:33:56] musherz_: @icarusdjr I feel like ruth is the necessary force in that context due to the long term effects it holds as a power to withhold even if its negative for her
[14:33:56] HardlyCamping: FUCK 'EM UP FLOPPERS
[14:33:57] codilynn32: Robert buddy no she’s not when all the cops, crims, and civs are tired of her
[14:33:59] criquetRL: mhm
[14:34:01] musherz_: They will find another ruth
[14:34:28] rclemon_: Fire Slacks and the PD will be 1000x better
[14:34:29] wavep987: @robertsmithjr Sure, Ruth is a great character doesn't mean she is right on everything. She is definitely alienating certain people. Good rp for all.
[14:34:30] Puk3s: Give it 2 weeks no one will be left
[14:34:35] Elfmylife: issue with the PD is theres to many chefs in the kitchen, one chief, captains to enforce it. simple as that
[14:34:42] DatDudeJakeC: Yeah, it was interesting that Slacks took out two cadets today.  Penny was on forever beforehand.
[14:34:43] Eddie1225: @Puk3s yea sure
[14:34:47] Eddie1225: OMEGALAUGHING
[14:34:49] Grumplestillskin: Slacks talks a lot about being “one PD”, telling cadets they can’t be on other shifts is the opposite of that imo
[14:34:50] Ned15: I understand not taking them, they should patrol on their shift
[14:34:55] Puk3s: Ya I am sure
[14:34:56] taraannee: i felt bad that cadet waited a long time & another cap told them to literally go off duty tho they were the only one in queue :(
[14:34:57] TimmayHS: Den and Cornwood were being harrassed by crims earlier and repeatedly called for backup but they were the only people on patrol, it's rough
[14:34:58] robertsmithjr: @codilynn32 if that were true i would imagine staff would have stepped in
[14:35:03] PolishGarnek: Gotta Get Crim Mains to  PD and Copmains to Chill on Crim characters  mhm
[14:35:04] Mouso9: I've heard the 1 step forward 3 steps back.    Why do I feel like slacks just needs to walk faster. Keep up the good work
[14:35:04] Ned15: There's a problem with people moving to other shifts

[14:35:11] tftgoat69: I feel like all captains are dealt an extremely difficult role. that's nearly impossible to fix
[14:35:11] cjohno20: The longer this hiring lag continues the more brutal the rebuild is gonna be.
[14:35:12] Silver_Sol_x: didnt cadets have limited hours for fto patrol? why is that not still a thing
[14:35:15] Eddie1225: Tomfoolery cadets waitinf 12 hours back in the day

[14:39:47] Eddie1225: too many shit cops

[14:41:07] JC9R_: id rather have a old rusty cop out there than no cop at all
[14:41:10] Ned15: This shift had like 30 officers and only 5 would show up
[14:41:13] buuutty: slacks aint budging on hiring some of the old cops?

[14:41:55] Hillbilly_Hxck: @javibcardi the new character could be pushed through a little quicker if Tim agrees he was ready or something
[14:41:55] raven1022: I think they need to add 1 or two veterans who can quickly become FTOs to avoid burn out. Especially if they are willing to do it and are capable of following the current SOPs

[14:44:50] wavep987: I am sorry for saying this but am glad Duncan took an LOA. He is the biggest doomer
[14:44:53] magnets_: too many doomers in the pd in general - make their way to chats and chat starts to doom
[14:44:54] ToxiccLadd: @Eddie1225 wipe it and run it back
[14:44:55] Alexqc19: @ssaab its a tuff situation for sure i do think having slot of skeleton crew not coming on duty hurt the situation alot sadly
[14:44:56] Joebowlr21: @Eddie1225 no shot KEKW
[14:45:00] golden_eagle_567: slow and steady is the way to go it will be better in the long run

[14:45:33] Elfmylife: if people arent going on duty its an OOC issue, they're not motivated to play cop. First step to growing a better force is making people feel like they want to go on duty, not just hiring more people
[14:45:36] rutako: make cornwood fto
[14:45:36] ykicka: imo the issue isn't so much PD by it's self. Its the PD slowburning while other aspects of the server are speed running as much as possible, and then the two collide.
[14:45:37] Grumplestillskin: Cornwood is slacks mentor, they never fight
