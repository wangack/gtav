[3:40:50] doc_sharon: katesHug
[3:41:12] mostly_minerals: The fact that you CAN start the crafting withouth everything feels dumb
[3:41:13] kerrymshar: katesHug
[3:41:15] Insaif: It still shouldn't act like you can make it if you don't have the mats to start with. The fact that you go through the whole process and THEN it says it didn't work? That's silly.
[3:41:32] willowfennec: ^
[3:41:32] Nightbot: ^
[3:41:50] Crafty_Crystal: makes no sense that it would allow it
[3:42:04] doc_sharon: is it like that so you can add mats after you started? katesHm
[3:42:45] Insaif: The only (ONLY) reason I can think of is that it allows you to add mats during the crafting process, so you have time to go gather/buy them during the craft time.
[3:43:10] Crazith: not a bad move, by the lumber union, waster Nikeas time with shit and then turn around and make better things
