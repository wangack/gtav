[2:39:44] CosmicQuibble: goonie is a new term.. or a movie from the 80's
[2:39:47] luisriv07: Lang twatting about where you can get the whole PC parts blueprints is gonna make it depreciate faster
[2:39:57] luisriv07: which doesn't affect them that much
[2:40:08] infinitemoon87: ashlolDance

[2:41:12] Hilink24: @maddison1246 ray is mad that materials for The company were costing 7 per where as most people were getting them for under that also someone got ocean dumped
[2:41:15] daisyleeh: ashlolDance2 ashlolDance2 ashlolDance2

[2:41:37] bonoginbigdog: was that who rob the sani workers

[2:41:59] StreamElements: Thanks for following joni_whize! ashlolFlower
[2:42:02] maddison1246: @hilink24 is that because they aren't union?
[2:42:12] redvipor: ashlolWiggle
[2:42:22] luisriv07: ashlolWiggle ashlolWiggle
[2:42:30] beau_daniel: not really
[2:42:30] infinitemoon87: ashlolWiggle

[2:42:34] redllittleruby: DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance
[2:43:00] maddison1246: @hilink24 so are guns hard to get
[2:43:01] StreamElements: Thanks for following earliermars12! ashlolFlower
[2:43:09] xscoxevox: Ngl If they shooting over computer parts I'm gonna die laughing lmao
[2:43:20] luisriv07: The Lester house unlock is gonna make the PC market plummet in a couple of days
[2:43:22] CosmicQuibble: hey. keep it separated
[2:43:23] beau_daniel: its just open season on union sani workers because of higher politics between company and lang
[2:43:40] Hilink24: @maddison1246 only cops have them so the only people with guns either stole them from cops or bought them from people who did
[2:43:58] isx196: @Hilink24 nan at start lang was gonna do 3 per by jp said no and it go up from there
[2:44:07] StreamElements: Thanks for following Joozcy! ashlolFlower
[2:44:15] maddison1246: @hilink24 ah okay
[2:44:28] theoutcastboi: The company put all their stocks into selling PCs, a finite market which was always going to lose value as supply increases and people start undercutting, which the company, try as they might, cannot prevent - for every one person undercutting them that they take down, there's two more about to come on the market.
[2:45:08] StreamElements: Watching ads helps support the stream and the hours of free entertainment! Subscribe to watch ad-free: https://www.twitch.tv/subs/ash ashlolAra
[2:45:09] Landarokz: It's more than that. The company sells a product that teaches the customer how to make their product.
[2:45:11] Falconari: LUL
[2:45:24] luisriv07: Lang wanted to make an agreement weeks ago with the Company for 3 per material and exclusivity but they starting making side deals and the price went up as punishment
[2:45:27] theoutcastboi: So the company is kinda screwed unless they diversify quickly, and even then, they'll be behind.
[2:45:46] CosmicQuibble: bully
[2:46:06] I3ailey: could u ask 911 to patrol the area too? :P
[2:46:14] luisriv07: The difference between the Company and Lang's group is that The Company has only invested in PCs and Lang has different groups in weed, sanitation, G6 and Grime
[2:46:20] Falconari: ashlolFeelsWow
[2:46:21] luisriv07: etc
[2:46:33] jambag00: @luisriv07 one is a gang and one does sanitation Kappa
[2:46:42] luisriv07: and materials mainly
[2:46:53] maddison1246: Need a police escort just for sani lol
[2:47:08] redvipor: ashlolNom
[2:47:12] Falconari: ashlolNom
[2:47:21] CosmicQuibble: bully means big moves
[2:47:27] theoutcastboi: @Landarokz Exactly, it's a finite product - once you have a PC, you don't really need another, and you then get the drone app which allows you to buy blueprints for racks and adv GPUs, which the company is trying to fob off for 20K.
[2:47:34] StreamElements: Thanks for following adrianrosu1! ashlolFlower
[2:48:48] CosmicQuibble: safety first
[2:48:51] luisriv07: Also the Company just wants to sell and even scam their clients if possible, but Yuno wants to make friends and help groups since they may be of help in the long run, so he's reasonable and even gives better deals
[2:49:00] theoutcastboi: So once you're set up, the average person can see how much of a scam the company are running, and can undercut them to an insane degree - Yuno was selling BPs for 8-10k, someone else was selling them for 3k!
[2:49:02] redvipor: With sergio protecting sufely its alot safer ashlolFeelsWow
[2:49:44] StreamElements: Thanks for following rhapsody_rex112! ashlolFlower

[3:07:35] jamerham: The correct opinion
[3:07:36] MadnessQuotient: more melee weapons?
[3:07:37] WentToBuyMilkAgain: Cops aren't ready for guns
[3:07:37] Veixa: The city is ready, some people are not :D
[3:07:42] CosmicQuibble: guns are basic rights
[3:07:43] Hilink24: guns just make everyone resort to using them more
[3:07:48] lronySZN: the longer the city isnt rust 2.0 im happy

[3:08:14] ItsMattyyyyy: maybe make ammo hard to get 😭
[3:08:25] Hilink24: cops need grende launchers
[3:08:27] I3ailey: i think they're doin a lot of training for new hires

[3:09:12] violet3137: having cop guns is already something I have opinions about tbh
[3:09:14] Veixa: Ammo or no ammo, doesn't matter. You still have to RP like all guns have ammo or it's nvl
[3:09:20] Lecruidant: @ash I think what they could do is start by only allowing the Police to use them in the first place. THerefore giving incentive to recruit more cops before civilian guns so there's a starting balance
[3:09:24] CosmicQuibble: standing in america?
[3:09:32] theySheShe: the rescue mission after hunting is funny tho

[4:44:12] thebrickprince: I'd be the first lightning bending earth bender. I'd use the kinetic energy of rocks smashing each other, connected to metal cables that carry the electric current. I'd just use the cables as whips and be a lightning bending-metal bender.
[4:44:13] LinksmutisLt: water - blood bending
