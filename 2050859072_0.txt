[3:25:49] brosk1997: he’s asking the person he knows won’t ask for money
[3:26:09] SPMate: Saint is probably a better shout she hasn't had anything to do
[3:26:19] bobbyybeee: @chris15257 yea Luke was just asking for something
[3:28:28] DanielleG__: nodd
[3:28:52] ammo_223: Saint or luke could do it with her so if she ain't around 1 of them can still run it
[3:29:32] svea7: oh yeah maybe tati and luke can be partners he helps her with money runs and she helps him with weed runs

[3:33:57] BenCuddz: I thought saint would go the pushing route tbh she loved it in 3.0
[3:34:13] L_E_O_N1: its not all about rep would be good for others to feel like they pulling their weight
[3:34:23] SPMate: @BenCuddz She wants to but won't ask people to come along
[3:34:36] Malding_Beta: you could find someone to consistently chop with you if you go through the whole process with them and split the money

[4:23:53] PhaseLord773: cant be over 30k else just take a pd one LuL
[4:24:13] zqamz: @pinchxr777 not really beacuse a gun license is 50
[4:24:19] o8j8m: gun fights are gonna be so interesting with the tarkov reloading PepeLa
[4:24:20] gibsthegoat123: pigeon should get some sort of in game thing that has guns involved cause of his drops and cinematics

[4:28:33] stnash52: LUL
[4:28:34] davey_9696: it will 100% be worth getting a gun license
[4:29:08] snoopzaka: And an irl point of view too
[4:29:12] Cardiia_: bro I don’t get it
[4:29:15] tyronethebigg: Having guns be more difficult to get than in 3.0 will make 4.0 more interesting
[4:29:23] Cardiia_: like unless you are a criminal you can’t “snitch”
[4:29:36] stnash52: depends some ppl just snitch on everything and it’s a bit meh imo
[4:29:37] HuntingJack: It’s when everyone starts snitching it gets out of control
[4:29:40] Cardiia_: like if you are a civ, get robbed and tell the cops that’s just how it is
[4:30:13] Cardiia_: THIS
[4:30:23] Cardiia_: if I was robbed rn Id call the cops LMAO
[4:30:33] tyronethebigg: I ain't no snitch I'll deal with losing my car
[4:30:38] LutonSucks8137: matteu1ADHD
[4:30:38] Cardiia_: like am I being like oh no lets not do that to the crim
[4:30:51] Cardiia_: but matt is involved in criminal activity
[4:30:57] Agnitto: if you are fighting a group that has a gun it is in your best interest that they lose that gun and snitching is one way to do that
[4:30:59] Malding_Beta: ci arc when?
[4:31:01] stnash52: ^
[4:31:01] StreamElements: ^
[4:31:02] Cardiia_: so why would he call the cops LMAO
[4:31:05] Malding_Beta: yeah

[4:31:22] Malding_Beta: light hearted snitching can be good rp
[4:31:43] Malding_Beta: just not snitch on serious crime arc
[4:31:46] bobbyybeee: there’s been loads of snitching Mr K, X, Buddha have all snitched

[4:32:05] o8j8m: you just making it out the hood 😭
[4:32:09] J_Harris18: It’s not that it doesn’t make sense, it’s that there’s no punishment
[4:32:23] XQUSIT: one group that will be interesting to see how they cope is civ gang as they will 100 snitch
[4:32:26] zqamz: @J_Harris18 ^
[4:32:26] StreamElements: ^
[4:32:26] J_Harris18: Used to be CG or somn would grab the snitch
[4:32:30] SPMate: Even if they shoot you for snitching you just jump out the hospital like nothing
[4:33:24] XQUSIT: Hydra did it to rust in 3.0 but that the only time a group got f for snitching
[4:33:30] J_Harris18: @spmate Yh or go snitch on em for shooting you LUL
[4:33:34] Cardiia_: i mean if they are known to be a snitch, in theory, no one should sell/work w them no more
[4:33:49] Cardiia_: so crim snitching has to be like anonymous
[4:33:52] JayB_8: ^^
[4:33:52] StreamElements: ^
[4:34:10] SPMate: That only counts if the snitch is a crim
[4:34:13] J_Harris18: So then that supplier would get cut off aswell

[4:47:43] zqamz: would be really hard for devs to do
