[2:03:27] EuphoniumMan: yo what keyboard is that?
[2:03:27] ItsSlyve: turn on rapid trigger

[2:03:34] ItsSlyve: you want to turn on rapid trigger
[2:03:34] oofinside: did you apply it?
[2:03:35] ChunkeeMonkey4209: How did Suicide Squad end up being last night? @EsfandTV was it good?
[2:03:36] BasApan: Its the same, thats not how that works
[2:03:37] EPiQ: just means you have to move it further to get the same amount of input
[2:03:38] TheFox0228: didn't sync the keys
[2:03:38] TheChubyUnicorn: No
[2:03:38] Feducu: @EsfandTV you didn't sync it!!!
[2:03:39] mikageval: wasnt that increasing the deadspace
[2:03:39] Ficktions: I think it's a GTA thing, where it has a minimum turn distance
[2:03:42] Cerkins: do you need to apply?
[2:03:42] Andy0urlittledog: SYNC TO ALL
[2:03:42] Blizzard5050: It won‚Äôt. keyboard will always turn the same. it‚Äôs not analogue.
[2:03:43] ToyzinN_: don't you have to sync it?
[2:03:43] Greenmaniac12: 4Shrug
[2:03:44] gimmedacheekz: No lol
[2:03:45] baller42o: because keyboard is either yes or no so its all the way or none
[2:03:45] yanni4100: Keys aren't analogue
[2:03:45] oddfeller: gotta sync/save it
[2:03:45] madhatterui: @EsfandTV isn't there a sensitivity option in the GTA settings?
[2:03:46] Bleakfoil: you have to zero it to activate, yes
[2:03:46] theani: but it would be the same press
[2:03:47] kennyizcool: SYNC
[2:03:47] clippy__xd: read below
[2:03:48] el_reyito: ?
[2:03:48] RoloDage: @joewelch29 yeah I can definitely be very out of date on that intel
[2:03:48] redrum359: ?
[2:03:50] Banchu: no
[2:03:50] Feducu: @EsfandTV press sync keys!
[2:03:50] Wallsh_: @EsfandTV  wheel still moves same amoutn of distance on press
[2:03:51] Karhock: actuation is just when it activates not the sensitivity of the turn
[2:03:52] goingafk0: yes and no
[2:03:52] MultiVersed: no
[2:03:52] Mikri: its still the same press
[2:03:53] Lucsvm: idk
[2:03:53] StellaSed: this is too 5head for me
[2:03:53] Mindhysteria: sync maybe?
[2:03:54] GYNECHIATRIST: red switches?
[2:03:54] MDM4ever1986HD: READ BELOW
[2:03:54] guilt_: @baller42o this
[2:03:54] ItsSlyve: @esfandtv put the press at the top and turn on rapid trigger
[2:03:55] Vestfolding: Ignored Speeder to complain. classic
[2:03:55] a_reallyangrydad: Too many big words
[2:03:56] Banchu: its just activates later
[2:03:57] viewlessd: sync all ketys sync all ketys
[2:03:57] geckoguy69: no that's not how it works
[2:03:57] SecretChiley: No
[2:03:58] EPiQ: it isn't analog, its just a "gate" for a digital input
[2:04:00] Shonuff_: that bonnie?
[2:04:01] T3r3nceSkill: dumb question: Do you say "Its me & you" instead of "Its You & me"? This an american thing?
[2:04:01] slomojosh: monkaW
[2:04:02] kyang026: No, keys are either 0 ro 100
[2:04:02] cosmicblood84: is that cornwoods gut hit his steering wheel
[2:04:02] Blizzard5050: depends, but not really
[2:04:02] Teddsan: that is not how it works
[2:04:03] ferromagneticfluid: uh oh
[2:04:04] Shonuff_: yeah it is
[2:04:04] furious_Trance: there may be a minimum time frame that can be captured by the game
[2:04:04] Denver_010: yes but key is either 1 or 0
[2:04:05] Leafyerick: @EsfandTV Do you have to hit the sync settings?
[2:04:05] TheFox0228: click the Sync options below the slider you're messing with @EsfandTV
[2:04:05] polarhehexd: the keyboard has to be analog, if it's digital it doesnt matter, it'll be binary how much of a press you are doing
[2:04:07] SecretChiley: It just means when it activates, not how long it lasts
[2:04:07] oofinside: WICKED
[2:04:09] Geralt_De_Rivia: she's quitting
[2:04:10] atwitchusername4me: sync settings to all keys
[2:04:10] Raja_Banhammer: Penny "Deadshot" Lane WICKED
[2:04:10] Wandering_Ranger: more just a delay on activation
[2:04:10] crazymxnboy: no you need a keyboard with pressure actucation
[2:04:11] cailtis: WICKED
[2:04:11] forgivme4partyrockingamen: but if it activates later, then it deactivates sooner Hmm
[2:04:11] xae00: its probably car dependent
[2:04:11] donny_dinosaur: you are just increasing the delay between press and something happening
[2:04:11] TheLlamaTrainer: Doesnt work that way. Thats why you cant play driving games on keyboard. Every click is the same sensitivity
[2:04:11] InsecureForSure: WICKED
[2:04:12] mikageval: Rapid trigger turns off the switch when u stop pressing it
[2:04:12] Lucsvm: wait Penny dindt get fired Pog
[2:04:14] geckoguy69: If you want to actually drive you need the analog keyboard or a controller

[2:04:22] EuphoniumMan: ?
[2:04:22] RebornOffline: You need an analogue keyboard for that @EsfandTV
[2:04:23] Smoogol: it doesn't change the output
[2:04:23] Blizzard5050: you MIGHT be holding the key longer, but it‚Äôs not analogue
[2:04:24] OutKast2: HOLD
[2:04:25] Zarniwooper: Penny "One Tap" Lane
[2:04:28] Renoufchr: you didnt sync the change
[2:04:28] Wallsh_: Every click is the same on GTA side
[2:04:28] Rattlerx: The duration of the "press" is still the same, you just changed when that "press" becomes active
[2:04:30] omn___i: no that‚Äôs penny chat Nerdge
[2:04:31] Aphotice: the key press doesnt work like a potentiometer. its either pressed or not pressed
[2:04:34] Banchu: it just activates later, further down, nothing more
[2:04:35] PsychoJoker: she only got dapped 1 point because she shot the person in the face
[2:04:35] Damien__: why does penny always want to 25 with cornwood
[2:04:36] Lucsvm: mhm
[2:04:38] ItsSlyve: @esfandtv turn on rapid trigger setting right below the actuation option
[2:04:39] theblackdog808: I get what you're saying
[2:04:41] kennyizcool: @EsfandTV Sync to all keys
[2:04:42] ItsMeZexx: that is not how that works @esfandtv
[2:04:42] PacGamer: holding Hmmge
[2:04:43] unic0rnhunter: you would need other switches to make this work properly i guess
[2:04:43] MatStanton: mhm Û†ÄÄ
[2:04:43] Feducu: @EsfandTV Go back to razer's and you need to sync the keys}
[2:04:44] oofinside: mhm

[2:04:47] Geralt_De_Rivia: peepoTalk
[2:04:47] Raja_Banhammer: Hmmge
[2:04:47] EuphoniumMan: your game is fucked your one is way more
[2:04:48] Shonuff_: Penny needs to re-learn her firearms, Cornwood would be a good FTO for it
[2:04:48] Blizzard5050: mechanical or analogue?
[2:04:49] a_reallyangrydad: Absolutely
[2:04:50] EPiQ: if you keyboard is analog, that's not the setting. That setting is just WHEN it activates to 100%
[2:04:51] oofinside: Penny Waiting
[2:04:51] ixkillxz0mbies: KEKW holding D
[2:04:52] RebornOffline: Actuation is just when it turns on or off

[2:04:56] Zarniwooper: hmmm maybe
[2:04:56] fauxRothko: Hmmge
[2:04:56] Bleakfoil: if you rapidly press the key yes it would be mhm
[2:04:57] ItsCodyJ: is buck still staying 100 as his callsign kekw
[2:04:59] ParashootTV: More precise, mhm
[2:04:59] Mike1C: Makes sense NODDERS

[2:05:00] el_reyito: CUM
[2:05:00] InsecureForSure: mostly for feel. not going to make a huge difference
[2:05:01] sexy_peach_on_twitch: what's the setting for the other key?

[2:05:01] Beep_Cx: peepoLegs esfandCozy TeaTime testfand content cozy
[2:05:02] Feducu: You need to click on SYNC KEYS
[2:05:02] HjFUN: might just be too small an effect

[2:05:03] Vestfolding: Is it that serious???
[2:05:03] rinacon: I just got to stream what is happening FeelsDankMan
[2:05:03] Connorbrow: I think that's optical, not analog
[2:05:04] polarhehexd: @EsfandTV to utilise analog keyboard you need to mimic controller settings using the keyboard software and in game settings
[2:05:04] quaylewastaken: but is gta set up to do that
[2:05:04] crazymxnboy: check out pressure activated keyboards
[2:05:05] viewlessd: sync it
[2:05:05] Goldberg33: its only milliseconds, but yes that makes sense
[2:05:05] Tcmasterzzz: Penny Waiting
[2:05:06] komplike: mhm but sync keys to apply
[2:05:06] Aphotice: driving with keyboard has always been rough
[2:05:07] oddfeller: I use controller for driving and keyboard/mouse for everything else
[2:05:08] ChainOfLightning: its how hard you press the button, no the duration
[2:05:09] softyblankets: You forgot to sync the key though
[2:05:09] Jerti_: if you press it very shortly it doesnt matter if its on release or on press
[2:05:10] MultiVersed: depends on how it's programed, it's not always a consistent input response
[2:05:10] tinywulf: sync settings to keys esfand
[2:05:10] lagwire: Penny when she sees a criminal with 100% of their brain inside their skull esfandHYPER

[2:05:13] fenrrs: you need to sync the settings @EsfandTV

[2:05:15] stickyjones1995: your not using the analog portion
[2:05:16] Beep_Cx: saabNotes
[2:05:16] Leffyxx: gotta sync your setting
[2:05:17] Banchu: sync to all keys
[2:05:17] furious_Trance: the game may not 'tick' faster than your current tap. so anything faster may not make a difference
[2:05:18] OutKast2: mhm
[2:05:18] BasApan: makes sence
[2:05:18] slomojosh: sync the settings
[2:05:19] Scarecro0w: HOLD THIS
[2:05:19] Bleakfoil: mhm
[2:05:19] quaylewastaken: but that has to be a in game setting
[2:05:20] Myagus: Didnt sync the settings
[2:05:21] RietArtwork: YEP
[2:05:22] RoseSwitches: yeah but sadly a keyboard is not like a controller where you can make fine adjustments.
[2:05:22] Geralt_De_Rivia: JUST GET GOOD
[2:05:23] spud_johnson: yes
[2:05:23] RebornOffline: Actuation is just where during the travel it activates
[2:05:23] 2000dennis: Yea
[2:05:25] OutKast2: mhm not listening at all
[2:05:25] Feducu: THERE
[2:05:25] disruptedorder: It's probably so minimal you wouldn't be able to notice @esfandtv
[2:05:27] Juvraj: i think you have to click synch
[2:05:27] nosticktoaster: its not that big a difference
[2:05:28] HistoriesPiston: pepeW what?
[2:05:28] twilightbaseballscene: he‚Äôs a genius
[2:05:28] quaylewastaken: in game setting
[2:05:28] oofinside: Pause
[2:05:29] emery_steele: yeah
[2:05:30] ALC4PWN: if its analog then change the actuation amount instead of the height so it turns you less when you tap @EsfandTV
[2:05:32] oofinside: try it now
[2:05:32] EPiQ: if the actuation point is higher, then its just not doing anything the rest of the press. Its not active "longer" per se
[2:05:32] Kiester_Felterbutts: Are we making low riders?
[2:05:32] hotdogdihydrogenmonoxide: No make the actuation at the top bc it will be active for shorter
[2:05:33] tekzd: @redrum359 1 for shooting at the head
[2:05:33] DetoxBKG: Yeah, assuming you are always pressing the key all the way down
[2:05:34] ItsSlyve: rapid trigger does exactly what you want the keyboard to do
[2:05:35] cosmicblood84: sex cult made your key board sticky
[2:05:35] oofinside: OKEY try it now
[2:05:36] SmoJith: nah
[2:05:36] Lancapan: Loading
[2:05:38] theblackdog808: just the time the command is on yeah, I'm not sure how that works though that's waaay too fancy for me LUL
[2:05:38] stickyjones1995: thats just the digital key press is at 50% or 60% or what ever you set
[2:05:38] locospacecake: buy a racing wheel controller connect on a swivel for driving
[2:05:39] Zarniwooper: Why dont you get a real driving wheel in front of you? Swap to it when driving
[2:05:42] mrs_strawberryy: what HDMI
[2:05:43] Syclone81: but the game have a base impuls for 1 hit of turn left or right on a car. so if you make the time shorter. it does not change the min amount of a turn impulse @EsfandTV
[2:05:43] RebornOffline: Actuation is just where during the travel it activates Û†ÄÄ
[2:05:44] reikster: is there a debounce time...that...might effectively set a minimum on time.
[2:05:46] omn___i: what does this have to do with seal twisting tho ?? I‚Äôm confused
[2:05:48] NOCTU4: just use your N64-controller
[2:05:48] BasApan: @EsfandTV sync to all keys
[2:05:49] gutshroom: Excuse me cornwood do you know how fast you werent going just now - sorry im calibrate my razer

[2:06:22] eaglezFly: placebo

[2:06:23] 0Douglas: you have to have analog turned on if you want it to turn less if you tap less

[2:06:24] komplike: SCHIZO
[2:06:24] forgivme4partyrockingamen: actually noticeable
[2:06:24] Felaryn: The strength of the turn isn't being affected just the duration
[2:06:25] redrum359: placebo fs
[2:06:26] Syclone81: yeah  but you can not lower this  impulse now
[2:06:26] Drkdream: it also depends on how the Input its updated, for example once per frame etc
[2:06:26] EPiQ: have a slower actuation just introduces "delay" to when the input is sent because your finger has to travel further
[2:06:27] moodymellow: The game was made for controller it makes sense
[2:06:27] cuspeli: SCHIZO

[2:06:38] Loth_nl: Good night Mr. Cornwood
[2:06:38] 1CaptainRedBeard1: Massive

[2:06:42] Jeremyohno: Yeah it's a duration thing
[2:06:42] isthisthingyon: FeelsStrongMan its massive

[2:06:47] a_reallyangrydad: When you‚Äôre right you‚Äôre right

[2:06:58] ip33fr331y: ‚Äú you guys literally saw it. It‚Äôs massive.‚Äù
[2:06:58] Aphotice: it might be working for driving, but you set it to all keys, so typing might be weird now
[2:06:58] gimmedacheekz: placebo
[2:06:58] fauxRothko: burneWaiting

[3:46:30] Dautrat: i mean both those gun instances, yesterday and today could be articulated as justifiable
[3:46:31] Vell_x: The thought process is understandable. But seeing handsup makes it rough
[3:46:32] Shakeboxing: swiftySnipe question later ;)
[3:46:32] blisca: from her perspective you'd been killed by locals, and they were still around your body

[3:46:35] Ragestrike: @EsfandTV  Bonnie never ever called a 13 a or B before i dont think she even knows how
[3:46:36] im_heffe: All of this because Cornwood got rolled by a local sad times
[3:46:37] M80_Osm: go get the car?

[3:46:39] MackPlays: She gotta learn the basics of driving
[3:46:39] hippiecat: i think the cop role is not good suit for her. It's a stressful role for her
[3:46:39] Philips502: peepoHey howdy

[3:46:45] YEP46: did she saw the 911? she answered she didnt see it

[3:46:46] Dumboodaking: she's just so new
[3:46:46] SMFTwistedSMF: No. Probably could had said you know the shit of "Step away from you" and all that with her gun out.
[3:46:47] Morgan_topkek: too
[3:46:48] ShaneyRL: is that a 13-C moment? lol

[3:46:52] Xierany: She did react a bit quick though, like she could afford to get closer before shooting
[3:46:52] KNGRSM: She heard a lot of shots fired and you on the radio saying "I might be going down here" and then you did not say anything to her for a long time @EsfandTV
[3:46:52] ShadowedSeraphim: @esfandtv I'd say you were more wrong than her since you didn't tell those guys to clear out and told them she wouldn't shoot
[3:46:52] BullPot: You can't blame that in being "new"
[3:46:52] sneaky_tiki: it will be all forgotten about tomorrow she is good LUL

[3:47:08] lucidifous: She got put in a one in a million situation KEKW hard to blame her
[3:47:09] MeltedNeurons: She needs thicker skin to get through the rough waters of RP for sure

[3:47:09] 2Amaze: Her driving is horrible though @EsfandTV
[3:47:09] Aynese: IMO that was the most realistic cop RP yet
[3:47:10] haleyheartt: y‚Äôall saying she shouldn‚Äôt be a cop, but everyone has to learn. penny is still learning.

[3:47:10] StormiNyan: bonnie a good bean esfandL esfandL
[3:47:10] SoulYou_: @EsfandTV current system in the PD is stressful. Every other streamer is taking breaks cuz its too much.

[3:47:11] Skycoh: the RP was so good up until she drove the car all over the place. it was funny as hell.
[3:47:11] BlueBird05: The "panic button" stuff... is it actually trained fully?
[3:47:12] huhddee: it's their fault LUL
[3:47:12] doggensteinn: call out a 13-B. for bonnie
[3:47:12] bobbybeee: give her some credit for the shot for sure IRL
[3:47:12] Janman88: telling them ur in a trainig would have helped ye
[3:47:12] magnets_: it was a messy situation i dont blame her for thinking they were locals when the last thing she heard cornwood say was "no im fine it's just a local" @EsfandTV
[3:47:12] Dumboodaking: @miketwng great advice
[3:47:12] Gn0mbat: @EsfandTV talk to Denzel Û†ÄÄ
[3:47:12] komplike: ICANT best FTO
[3:47:13] TheMrGromble: You actually told them to come out when they asked if she'll think they did it
[3:47:13] Dugnis: With all the cops getting targeted lately, I think she was mostly right honestly
[3:47:14] Lite_Ice: so this is actually all your fault LUL
[3:47:14] iwannanuhh: I think it can be a situation where no one was in the wrong.  It can be a mistake AND she can not be at fault. Thats why you can sue the state and not the officer
[3:47:14] skeletonmike: bonnie is hilarious and i approve of her cop status
[3:47:14] BjRumplee: She SHOULD be a cop. She adds a whole different dynamic to cop RP. its not always about chasing bad guys and shooting criminals
[3:47:14] SpikerzX: You should have called for the 911b, even tho more than 1officer will come
[3:47:14] Craze_Ewon: She just needs training not to shoot first. Check the situationf irst. I thought it was goign to go down exactly like it did (other than her aim)
[3:47:14] Coreytries: they asked if they were gonna get shot by her lol
[3:47:14] Zarniwooper: They should have stayed in car

[3:47:15] BelllGoR: so what you're saying is you both should be fired KEKW
[3:47:15] chipwitley: she needs to learn to drive on non cop character
[3:47:15] CovenousTTV: CHAT don't say shit like "she shouldn't be a cop" etc. she is still new and doesn't know everything yetr
[3:47:15] PoisonDart11: anyone who says she shouldnt be a cop needs to hold that same stance on cornwood when he first joined the pd
[3:47:15] TheKRT: there should be as 13C for Cornwood esq situations @EsfandTV
[3:47:16] Kalious78: @esfandtv tbh penny would make a fkin amazing clown with chatterbox
[3:47:16] greyjulian: Cop RP is just hard chat.  she needs time to learn game mechanics and settle in that‚Äôs all.  Penny is awesome
[3:47:16] NautMe: I cant believe
[3:47:16] Connorbrow: Yeah, I don't think she needs physical weapons training. She needs more classroom/shadow work to understand when and where to do what
[3:47:16] PoisonDart11: anyone who says she shouldnt be a cop needs to hold that same stance on cornwood when he first joined the pd Û†ÄÄ
[3:47:17] ItsANoBrainer: The amount of people OOC invested in being angry at her is fucking insane. Holy fuck guys chill out and have some compasion.
[3:47:17] SMFTwistedSMF: But nah, It was a normal gut reaction.
[3:47:18] nochooch: Coverup Cornwood
[3:47:18] Redtwintails: I mean you were down and couldn‚Äôt know tho
[3:47:18] og_afroman: he did say "im not gonna get shot am i?" KEKW

[3:47:18] Navigator_Nav: All good, well rp'd out
[3:47:18] oliverpeb: still better than Parm

[3:47:19] Mr_Fungi: you did say they wouldnt get shot and were fine to stay lol
[3:47:19] NasrulAshr: Tbh rp wise, it make so much sense for her lmao
[3:47:19] blisca: cornwood growing his dumpy?
[3:47:19] ShinJiHun: chat really saying she shouldn't be a cop and ignoring why this situation happened in the 1st place OMEGALUL
[3:47:20] Tcmasterzzz: they asked if they were gonna get shot
[3:47:20] validanswer: to be honest this situation was cornwood's fault lol

[3:47:21] PoisonDart11: anyone who says she shouldnt be a cop needs to hold that same stance on cornwood when he first joined the pd
[3:47:21] crazymxnboy: either way its dap worthy
[3:47:21] Icestruggler: you shouldve called a 13b and told the g6 guys to call EMS and stay away, imo
[3:47:22] cliffhanger101: all she needs is good training
[3:47:22] Anaximander2099: is it me or is Big C looking extra thicc today
[3:47:22] lagomconspiracy: That was funny I hope she doesn't feel too bad about it it was great
[3:47:23] frickjerm: its rp its supposed to be fun who cares if she shot em
[3:47:23] jacksmithcje: you should have just not gone to get a local tbh i called it would go south but holy that was different gald those two took it well though
[3:47:23] Jkooc: better coms before going down IMO

[3:47:24] skympii: its a learning process no one is perfect
[3:47:24] a_mortal_adam: Shit stressful watching it gets me stressed so cant blame for getting over whelmed
[3:47:24] my69thaccount: she‚Äôs gonna quit. she already talked about doing more irl and moving to New York yesterday
[3:47:25] ShakeShakey: Why is chat passing judgement
[3:47:25] TheSlike123: Its a typical mistake. Irl pepole would havedone the same @esfandtv
[3:47:25] twilightbaseballscene: cornwoods pants are sending me
[3:47:26] Madcroczz1: Just check that shes ok ladydimaHeart

[3:47:27] Dumboodaking: people in chat being like "just don't have anxiety" KEKW
[3:47:28] Surnami: Is it just met or does Cornwood's pants look really tight and form-fitting today?

[3:47:32] MoohamedAlii: She shouldn't shoot if its 13B
[3:47:32] Tensetechnician: Yes. You probably should have,but your RP of being murdered by a local kind of muckedthst
[3:47:34] marsmike918: Maybe training should be announced state wide
[3:47:35] rickybegas: Everybody fucks up from time to time, it is what it is

[3:47:42] sixoddeight: she is little texas ready
[3:47:43] hoanzlgoas: if all Cops do things right, it would be sooo boring. Look at Cop RP where everything goes smooth, after a few hours it becomes a little bit boring to watch
[3:47:43] n0oxaskek: it was an unhinged situation, no point in having regrets on either side
[3:47:43] BeatsSaid: is she getting another dap?
[3:47:44] ItsYojimbo: @EsfandTV lets be honest you shouldnt have left penny on the airstrip, you shouldnt have been chasing a local in a tank, you shouldnt have been getting in a shootout with a local
[3:47:44] Jmann_: It was funny. So whatever
[3:47:45] Twan0802: it‚Äôs not that deep chat
[3:47:45] In_Umbra: Let's be honest. This happened because you kidnapped a local in the highway. It all started there Kappa

[3:47:47] MrBASins: the comment was al little miss letting in the first place
[3:47:47] grautrr: as long as everyone learns from it

[3:47:56] kasded: We need a real OOC psychologist in the PD  KEKW
[3:47:56] KrustytheClown68: @EsfandTV Man, cornwood is packing some buns.
[3:47:57] bobbybedstains: now the driving after was not justifiable LuL
[3:47:57] Shonuff_: Bonnie is a brand new player which is why it's so impressive seeing her be a cop, which is probably one of the toughest things in GTARP.  most cops already have experience
[3:47:58] kleytonbruck_br: the thing is, she was already there training because she shot somebody, its such a difficult situation for her
[3:47:58] Janman88: if u last hear locals got me - then downed u defend the downed officer @EsfandTV its logic
[3:47:58] The_Original_Badman: @Lite_Ice Once she screamed at him the story changed LUL
[3:48:00] bzerk26: last thing she heard was you saying your going down from locals she didn't know the locals were down so shooting wasn't the worst decision
[3:48:00] StormiNyan: chat stop being dumb esfandL
[3:48:05] captain_steve_420: she'd make a great EMS
[3:48:05] im_zor: PPO?
[3:48:05] Xav__: You left the base to attack locals
[3:48:06] JPDoyle95: will high command lose there minds about this if they find out? from a 3rd party?
[3:48:06] shin5sato3: That's some serious COPEFAND . She made a mistake, and that's fine. Let's not try and spin it any other way.
[3:48:06] AbeFroman2: she did learn to not shoot first though lol
[3:48:06] Barbus666: it was just a SHITSHOW from the start
[3:48:06] SPxTDG: its the time to make mistakes if anything
[3:48:07] SulhBatarnak: NODDERS gonna learn
[3:48:07] companhero: COPIUM
[3:48:08] Hitcher_TV: the only thing she did wrong was her driving lol
[3:48:08] wispamii: honestly, that was some damn good rp. but i am hoping she doesn‚Äôt take it to heart after she calms down. <3
[3:48:09] Zarniwooper: Shes had pretty hectic 2 first days as PPO lol
[3:48:10] intoxicologistt: tbh, after those past few days where pd got shot at all the time, im not surprised she did what she did, i would do the same lmao
[3:48:11] kkoonaz: Chat stop power gaming üòú
[3:48:12] 2Amaze: @StormiNyan xqcHead xqcSleeper
[3:48:12] Clodhoppr: Penny ‚ÄúDeadshot‚Äù Lane

[3:48:13] stekie: I can see how she made the mistake
[3:48:13] slomojosh: she also has 0 GTA experience too
[3:48:14] fauxRothko: CAUGHT i could see wrangler doing the same
[3:48:14] Big_Dave_420: Playing a cop char is expert level
[3:48:15] pr0digy_1: Den would have shot too
[3:48:16] Cerkins: mhm
[3:48:16] MackPlays: Driving is literally #1 right now
[3:48:18] ScyThE619: wait what happened?
[3:48:18] TehDobster: @EsfandTV You just need to get her driving on the same level as her shooting LUL
[3:48:19] FauxReal__: Not trying to be critical because it was a funny outcome, but messing around with locals with guns led to the whole situation lol
[3:48:19] jacksmithcje: in a lighthearted way with no hate please stop having gun fights with locals haha
[3:48:19] rockyandbullwikle: Bobby would have shot
[3:48:20] momzzyy: LULW
[3:48:21] ChippieChad: fucking with armenians again kekw
[3:48:22] Fakomi: I think it didn't help that one of the guys was on the phone, masked, and not in G6 uniform.
[3:48:22] Brakon: its a sideeffect of wanting new people and not enought training.
[3:48:23] chewie820: you need to just take her gun away tbh
[3:48:24] RexPappa: mental gymnastics EZ
[3:48:24] batperson: did you want to use the locals as meat targets?
[3:48:24] omn___i: NOPERS not making sense again Classic
[3:48:24] momzzyy: KEKW
[3:48:25] Kavalier1: @Twan0802 yeah it really isnt. it was the stuff that happened after like the driving
[3:48:25] Dumboodaking: I feel like cop requires a bit more experience with GTA RP
[3:48:25] Scully_18: I mean I watched her jump off the roof
[3:48:25] SilverGhostMD: Dude if anyone has an issue with what just happened then RP isn't for them, it was funny af. Like it's GTA this isn't real life... mistakes like that are pure content GOLD
[3:48:28] God_is_a_cat_girl: in RP she already had fellow officers being shot and looted, so she acted according with what she experienced OkayChamp
[3:48:28] smotherytripod: #PrayforPennysEnemies
[3:48:28] FireFireFireFireFireFire: isn't this a good thing tho really? it's something special/entertaining happening no?
[3:48:29] 1CaptainRedBeard1: Go get that car.
[3:48:31] ItsANoBrainer: The amount of people OOC invested in being angry at her is fucking insane. Holy fuck guys chill out and have some compasion. Û†ÄÄ
[3:48:31] TheSlike123: Cops have done the same mistale irl @esfandtv
[3:48:31] hoanzlgoas: @EsfandTV  next time take Andrews and a EMS with you for target practice LUL
[3:48:31] Poklos: she needs another ooc chat
[3:48:31] Coreytries: you have a shooting range to teach her how to shoot tho no? @esfandtv
[3:48:31] LyraNoctem: Am i losing my mind or is Cornwood wearing PD leggings?
[3:48:31] jukla12: @EsfandTV she will learn while doing it, experience
[3:48:32] biking_solo: shoot first ask questions later always YEP
[3:48:32] Janman88: as FTO u need to let the PPO know whats about to happen @EsfandTV
[3:48:32] Tensetechnician: @storminyan stop policing chat like Penny Kappa
[3:48:33] FireFireFireFireFireFire: something to talk about etc
[3:48:33] lzrdwzrdtv: wHY IS CORNWOO WEARING LEGGINGS
[3:48:33] SquishMitten66: like the tank training, penny would be great at it
[3:48:33] R3d_Gum: Hey mistake are there to learn on them
[3:48:34] 0Douglas: You should have 13b or 311, there was no way for the to know if you did go down or being held up etc @EsfandTV
[3:48:34] smokebreezy: den would have called 77 to chase
[3:48:34] GlitchyByte: cornwood like them yoga pants
[3:48:34] sneaky_tiki: Hope shes all good things happen people move on nobody is perfect
[3:48:35] BrainOnAutopilot: I would have got scared and ocean dumped everyone KEKW
[3:48:35] ElizabethAtDawn: 100%
[3:48:35] MackPlays: Worrying about who to shoot before even driving a car
[3:48:35] Clodhoppr: I mean also yeah you FAFO‚Äôd with Ali‚Äôs KEKW
[3:48:35] genesissukehiro: LENNY HAWK WOULD SAY SHE WAS IN THE RIGHT BROTHA
[3:48:36] bnellaa: i just realized cornwood is caked tf up
[3:48:36] chalk141: Maybe brand new players should not be a cop out the gate? Learn through playing, kind of thing.
[3:48:37] SpiceWeaseI: did you check to see if they ran your pockets?
[3:48:37] Ingenic: i would have done the same in her situation
[3:48:37] GILx87: I worry about the ribbing she will be getting going forward.
[3:48:37] DetoxBKG: The current "training" is really only for people who are already cops
[3:48:39] Cheexur: @esfandtv let‚Äôs be honest you kidnapped a local which started it all hahahaha your fault
[3:48:39] n0oxaskek: i wouldve started blasting too
[3:48:41] Mallyraws: !mic
[3:48:41] Coop42: She just dommed someone last night!!!!
[3:48:41] MDM4ever1986HD: the tazer scuffed right?
[3:48:42] Crazyoldfool: End of the day, its still just a game and people make mistakes.
[3:48:42] FHviding: Just don't let the catastrophic thoughts get to you. A lawsuit is not the end of the world
[3:48:42] ll_Adam_ll: hell of a shot but her drive could do with a little extracurricular training
[3:48:43] KappaManJason: get a cadet now?
[3:48:44] RocketMcCoy: Especially everyone has been getting shot by non-locals lately everyone on edge
[3:48:44] pallywacker117: Cop RP is like playing on Hardmode. And Bonnie is honestly doing really well. She's hit the ground running for the most part
[3:48:44] Drackaine: at least it was a damn good lesson on what not to do KEKW
[3:48:44] Downbag: Bonnie really had 1 training day, never got gunsafety training
[3:48:45] apb2023: buts common sense not to shoot in that situation.  a cop role should be for someone that knows how to be a cop
[3:48:46] Reptocide_: car
[3:48:46] bzerk26: especially with cops getting shot and robbed everyday
[3:48:46] ShaneyRL: Who was that in the hallway?
[3:48:47] splooshtasticals: They haven't run to much scenarios so it is hard to fathom 4 some. good thinkin
[3:48:47] wonderboy543: You need to NEVER go OOC and just roll with whatever happens because it can be fixed in RP later.
[3:48:48] woolfdesign: I was really hoping for a Bobby/Penny duo team. Like Cornwood/Andrews
[3:48:48] Entropystachio: strimmer let me tell you my opinion as a 100 hour rp watcher Chatting
[3:48:48] iratestompyemu: tbh, the minority of chat is the reason it sucks to play gta
[3:48:49] Epid0x: @EsfandTV it's the same thing as real life jobs, people get frustrated when the new hire doesn't know everything a couple days in
[3:48:49] icephrogg: but she just shot someone yesterday mcknulty my demote her u think so?
[3:48:50] azncheesy: WHY THEY KEEP WASHING YOUR PANTS TIGHTER
[3:48:51] rizaus: It was also in a really remote area so probably didn't expect actual people to be there
[3:48:51] ggsz: @Danny_Dallas dumbass
[3:48:52] marsmike918: Sounds like cornwood deserved a couple DAP points
[3:48:53] Mallyraws: esfand what mic do you use?
[3:48:54] Buck__Wild: Cornwood needs to stop fucking with Armenians too KEKW
[3:48:54] CovenousTTV: @EsfandTV You are completely right but she did have a great reason to believe they were locals
[3:48:55] Sacredtenshi: @EsfandTV Please get her driving lessons
[3:48:55] jeffrey778: i think if even if cornwood was in the same situation as penny, it would have been the same result i think, even with cornwoods current training
[3:48:56] Mindhysteria: tbh their should be a shooting range in the pd with the fucking 3+ stairs
[3:48:57] Milaudis: Its not only the rp, You know eachother irl and it can be confusing if its real or rp
[3:48:57] taraannee: imo kinda shows academy & FTO sessions dont go thru enough possible scenarios to prep for but thats just me *shrug*
[3:48:57] daltonlowe74: they did joke about robbing you
[3:48:57] darthpuff2544: Why is Cornwood wearing leggings?
[3:48:58] spookdaddi: idc about literally any of the logistics. that was just fun to watch tbh
[3:48:58] Redtwintails: idk I think it‚Äôs stretching it
[3:48:59] Prugal: @bnellaa This fucking killed me
[3:49:00] Shonuff_: LULW
[3:49:00] w111iam1: Yeah maybe she should practice with another character a bit
[3:49:01] MHOPjr: is there no VOD today? what happend?
[3:49:03] Triist0ne: you killed his friend D:
[3:49:03] RossTheBoss__: u took his homeboy maybe ICANT
[3:49:03] xxxelfie: right like for example can locals even drive the gruppe six cars?
[3:49:04] ciphz: HypeShock thats balls
[3:49:04] Felrane: was his friend
[3:49:05] Biuntx: i saw bonnie cuff and esocrt at the same time and almost got in trouble yesterday
[3:49:06] Redtwintails: true
[3:49:07] Janman88: also maybe next time take another officer with u for training @EsfandTV
[3:49:07] ShakeShakey: These crazy locals
[3:49:07] Ganongoat: You went looking for some dummies for her to shoot, and found a couple dummies for target practice
[3:49:07] driver1036: It was his kin
[3:49:07] komplike: randomly LULE
[3:49:08] Shonuff_: yeah that car was gunning for you
[3:49:08] oliverpeb: the armenians
[3:49:08] theblackdog808: Wanted his brother back Kappa
[3:49:08] Clodhoppr: you could have driven him toward Lane and she could have practiced on him
[3:49:09] Drunkenhunter2: From her perspective it would be logical to shoot. You hear shots fired, 2 ppl over your body in an area where you wouldn't expect other players
[3:49:09] Piggens: Why is no one pointing out its Cornwood fault for messing with locals
[3:49:09] msnzonegamingadvocate: It was witness to the entire event from all perspectives of the parties involved. One thing was clear - it was 80% Miz's fault.
[3:49:09] FCMotive: locals.. together.. strong
[3:49:09] Greenmaniac12: you killed his brother kekw
[3:49:09] StormiNyan: that local was PISSED
[3:49:10] Xav__: They always do to you

[3:49:11] Zarniwooper: All armenians went CRAZY
[3:49:12] Syn1285: cornwood training
[3:49:13] Jerti_: she did panic very quick after the whole situation, i wonder what happened to the woman she hit, was that a local?
[3:49:13] furious_Trance: well u kidnapped his buddy SAJ
[3:49:13] Chrisaroo_: wasnt a local
[3:49:13] DenizenOfTheVoid: that local was like a good samaritan
[3:49:13] M1sterRZ: It's all because of Ali Pog
[3:49:13] FreakTheMedic: Cheer100 training is made to make mistakes, it‚Äôs about how you learn from them
[3:49:14] Daeide: damn look at that gyatt
[3:49:15] ExHolic: @EsfandTV can you change pants please
[3:49:15] PoisonDart11: RIPBOZO

[3:49:16] SMFTwistedSMF: He was chasing you in the car. That was crazy.
[3:49:17] xungrateful: If it's that stressful for her irl though it seems like it's a bit too much atm.
[3:49:17] surprised_brick: And then flipped the car LUL LUL
[3:49:18] Bhasgreth: this is 80% mizkif's fault
[3:49:19] lzrdwzrdtv: @Prugal i WANNA STOP STARING BUT I CANT
[3:49:19] johnnycolision: he was a part of the Armenian gang and saw you carrying his boy KEKW
[3:49:20] Dugnis: Lenny would've done the same thing probably lmao
[3:49:20] driver1036: I am Legend kinda stuff
[3:49:20] sticks26: Yeah just be less trigger happy is all she needs to learn
[3:49:20] jacksmithcje: shes one of the only actual super new people and she is doing great considering and those guys took it well all in all cornwood needs to stop having gang fights with locald haha
[3:49:20] Ares_Red: @EsfandTV is your car still out there where you got local ems?
[3:49:21] w111iam1: The whole situation was a Shitshow LUL
[3:49:21] kyleeeeeee_: it all leads to cornwood LULW
[3:49:21] xxTOPPExx: Everyone saying but she drives horriable, one of the Owners of the server fly out his windshield daily on the server lol hahaha
[3:49:21] PsychoJoker: Yeah Happy made a comment about stealing your gun LUL but i think he was joking
[3:49:22] woolfdesign: Tell her she has to come back to PD.... for Bobby
[3:49:22] JustinBinder: Locals dont have right its in the law now
[3:49:22] ookz: you kidnapped his friend moon2GN
[3:49:23] Noth1c: she also thought they were locals
[3:49:23] komplike: it was armenians LULE
[3:49:23] Barbus666: i think that was the locals friend you kiddnapped
[3:49:23] Redtwintails: LUL
[3:49:24] Zolothan: what is happening with these pants
[3:49:25] HogballTV: Is cornwood gonna be good, he not gonna get any daps for this?

[3:49:28] Thomefan251: rip vod lol
[3:49:28] doutplayd: Miz caused this
[3:49:28] yatesy118: 5 stars from the locals LUL
[3:49:29] my69thaccount: they way u reacted stressed her out more than her shooting them
[3:49:31] EpicOfGiggamesh: Lenny would have congratulated her lmao @esfandtv she just cares about you as a person IRL
[3:49:31] prup777: 0+
[3:49:32] n0oxaskek: im proud of penny, she followed the cornwood way, shoot first ask later
[3:49:33] funkie: That local started yelling "I'm gonna k.... " and went nuts :D
[3:49:33] StormiNyan: xdd the Armenians
[3:49:33] RawerPower: Turner said she gets emotional and does mistakes... and that's both Bonnie and Penny
[3:49:33] Shonuff_: it was pretty funny LULW
[3:49:33] Speeddevilx: didnt hear her announce herlself think that was the only problem i saw tbh otherwise i get what hes going though
[3:49:34] vael123: 80%  Joey Parmesans fault Û†ÄÄ
[3:49:34] RaptorQuiz: Why are we ignoring the REAL issue which is that Cornwood is wearing yoga pants?
[3:49:34] miketwng: blame the locals
[3:49:35] SoulYou_: @EsfandTV current system in the PD is stressful. Every other streamer is taking breaks cuz its too much. Goof RP requires a bit of sweat gaming and if you go over
[3:49:35] hoanzlgoas: she has to do her weapons training tomorrow then with you not around, gues this will be better, just tell her to not tell anybody what happend today
[3:49:35] Zarniwooper: YOU MESSED WITH WRONG ARMENIAN
[3:49:36] Floridag218: honestly I get why you both got upset and all‚Ä¶.but if both sides would have just laughed about it, that shit was funny as f content lmao
[3:49:36] Triist0ne: Looking GYAT
[3:49:37] Cheexur: local lives matter they stick together
[3:49:37] damroyalty: 80% Miz's fault
[3:49:37] forgivme4partyrockingamen: GYAT
[3:49:37] Coreytries: cornwood loses fto ability from this watch. Ruth was keeping eyes on this one Kappa
[3:49:38] charybdes: what happened to the situational training exercises you and Slacks were gonna do?
[3:49:39] hellbound0666: nice motorcycle pants
[3:49:39] rickyred66: It looks to me like RP should be real or goofy. It's to hard to police then in between
[3:49:39] gunshowtony: probably the best rp moment this year
[3:49:39] SurelyBaked: it's crazy that none of that would've happened if the local didn't chase you lmao
[3:49:40] Dumboodaking: can we just say this is 80% miz's fault?
[3:49:40] Felrane: conwoods ass bigger then normal today

[3:49:42] wispamii: At first I saw the situation, and got super nervous because it got real super fast. I sensed something wasn‚Äôt right, but she is a damn good shot and she should be proud of contributing to great content at the end of all this. Love to you and Bonnie. <3
[3:49:42] Clodhoppr: you could have Trained him to Lane and she could have gotten target practice
[3:49:43] not_uniq: did she get sent off duty or? i just got here
[3:49:44] andrewrobot11: Some if these chatters are dumb to think if you make a mistake it means you should not be a cop.
[3:49:44] PicklemanJaro: @EsfandTV what about the car
[3:49:45] dismxmber: just got here, what happened?
[3:49:46] Smoogol: YEP messed with the wrong armenian
[3:49:46] bojackgoatman: when she flew out the windshield LUL
[3:49:47] MTP1213: she screaming at you IRL was wild tho lol
[3:49:48] Athbreith: @EsfandTV But how is this Mizs' fault?
[3:49:50] MrBASins: its was a mistake and hopefully she and you both figure it out in the end its a game and sometimes thing just happen
[3:49:51] chalk141: I think broadsiding that bunny in the ditch was the straw D:
[3:49:53] AbeFroman2: she realized they werent locals
[3:49:54] KappaManJason: is there cadets still waiting @esfandtv
[3:49:57] Mindhysteria: @EsfandTV need actual training dummies like wow in server

[3:50:00] Cereal_Killa: that doesnt explain the driving tho KEKW
[3:50:00] GILx87: "Packin' Penny Lane" LUL
[3:50:03] coldan01: YEP

[3:50:03] hotdogdihydrogenmonoxide: @EsfandTV i hope you tell Bonnie what you are saying now because i dont want her to stop trying because of all this
[3:50:05] splooshtasticals: pondering Hmm
[3:50:06] wonderboy543: Just let it play out.  You should not have gone OOC.
[3:50:07] taraannee: question: u run up on chaotic scene, officer down, 2 ppl standing over, how do u tell they're locals not chars??
[3:50:08] CovenousTTV: Tbh chat yall shouldnt try to deny bonnies right to be able to play whatever she wants. Its here character, not yalls
[3:50:08] DezalbM: pd slot is coveted some people will be salty
[3:50:08] Triist0ne: 80% Miz's Fault mhm
[3:50:08] Zwierz69: ok but how can we blame this on Ruth
[3:50:09] Waytodawn: -1
[3:50:10] iamJANNN: iamJANNN subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! digging the lululemons on cornwood esfand
[3:50:10] RetPaladinBot: @EsfandTV - iamJANNN just resubbed using Prime for 2 months PagChomp

[3:50:18] Alistic: Lane is a fine officer NODDERS
[3:50:19] Zeldeza: tbh I thought you got up to take control of her keyboard KEKW
[3:50:19] tak0g0dz: moon2W
[3:50:19] vicious_pen: make the gesture of explaining to her how you messed up
[3:50:20] DrWetbone: sorry she‚Äôs stressed but from viewer point of view was excellent
[3:50:20] marsmike918: Who gets the DAP points??
[3:50:20] Redtwintails: I get it, but you can‚Äôt take full responsibility for their emotions
[3:50:20] sneaky_tiki: KEKW
[3:50:20] funkie: and it was happy, and then then bunny rabbit :D and all crashes
[3:50:21] bobbybeee: go check on her for 2 mins

[3:51:03] btjmga: I think the worst part was her killing a rabbit
[3:51:04] Lanolinlol: it was because she hit that bunny
[3:51:04] omascas: Yep, you went overprotective and it shook her. You had good intentions but hey, this how we learn to mesure highs and lows
[3:51:05] legobind: this is why ppl do crime so much less stress
[3:51:05] wonderboy543: Nah, gotta trust the system.  It's all good in RP.

[3:51:12] BrainOnAutopilot: atleast Cornwood knows she's has his back frenn
[3:51:13] slomojosh: it‚Äôs really hard for brand new players to be cops under the uber strict structure. there needs to be room for mistakes.
[3:51:13] hoanzlgoas: and even if cornwood gets fired, man the rp of that would be soo good
[3:51:13] splooshtasticals: kept spiraling 4 her mentally. I can see that.
[3:51:13] babbletross: people forget its not"just rp" there literally thousends of people watching and judging everything you do. that sound quite stressfull to me.

[3:51:24] God_is_a_cat_girl: unless you are a crim, crims don't care LULW
[3:51:26] Leptoni: I can completely understand her thought process. Only fact indicating situation was not serious was that you did not call 13a/13b but that is "easy" to miss when stressed.
[3:51:26] PsychoJoker: @ALDO_T7 I wonder this too
[3:51:26] DaelinT: you gotta get your car eventually
[3:51:27] AngelRunz: Cornwood has to many pull to get fire at this point

[3:51:33] komplike: its a game LULE its okay
[3:51:33] Entropystachio: just gotta understand how that channels into RP and make it something fun, it's all good <3
[3:51:33] Dumboodaking: its still day 2 KEKW
[3:51:33] wispamii: @babbletross true that man
[3:51:34] chalk141: Cornwood once saved a cow, he needs to go back and save that bunny Kappa

[3:51:36] ElizabethAtDawn: it was also hard to tell from our pov if it was real stress or rp stress
[3:51:37] wonderboy543: Everything can be fixed in RP, is what she needs to realize.
[3:51:37] doc_jade: You should probably make a report about this or if someone brings up the 911 call itll be bad from captains
[3:51:37] btjmga: I think the worst part was her killing a rabbit  Û†ÄÄ
[3:51:38] mtmathes: overall it was a good situation for her. Stressful situations aren't necessarily bad.  It gives her a basis for future decisions.
[3:51:38] hoanzlgoas: What she needs to understand, no matter what happens to Cornwood, the RP will always be super great
[3:51:38] orangewhiteorange: PD has been facing giga consequences recently. Doesn't help.
[3:51:40] joeseph00: What happened yesterday?
[3:51:40] Shonuff_: yeah Bonnie is a nice person
[3:51:41] Count_Brennuvarg: @EsfandTV personally I think it's like 80% Joey Parmesan's fault
[3:51:42] Felrane: the panic driving was really funny
[3:51:42] Speeddevilx: to be fair i think she should've taken a day off after that if it stressed her irl.
[3:51:43] Coreytries: I feel you going ooc with everything really made it awkward. Besides that it was funnysituation though
[3:51:44] Crazyoldfool: what happened yesterday?
[3:51:48] Athbreith: You never gave the rabbit money @EsfandTV Smadge
[3:51:48] grautrr: you‚Äôre a good dude. As a friend you did the right thing. Try not to overthink things. You sorted the RP side. As long as she‚Äôs good O
[3:51:48] SwitchBord001: Game related irl break down. Got it.
[3:51:48] SoLDiER510: Haha walking back and forth from room to room
[3:51:49] FauxReal__: When she heard you yelling OOC from the room over probably put her stress level over the top tbh. Good for her to take the time off though
[3:51:49] forgivme4partyrockingamen: the gauntlet of locals on the road was hilarious
[3:51:49] 0Douglas: it all good brudda but if you 13b she would have known it wasnt an active threat to begin with @EsfandTV

[10:18:32] quaylewastaken: He voluntarily gave the DNA I don't think he was being charged with anything
[10:18:38] MisterParry: you just need to find the report that it comes from
[10:18:39] horsegirldotca: yeah cause you have to update the DNA eventually?
[10:18:39] xCheekz: people can come in and volunteer DNA without cases against them, you woldnt make a report of that
[10:18:50] Brakon: if they find the report that it was in and it says why they took it
[10:18:58] ltl_wackman: wish it was easier to find the report
[10:19:13] Kalious78: All you do is get his dna when he's arrested and update it then. Hardly an issue
[10:19:14] Sh4rkill3r: @Ruttiger64 it is. if you dont follow proper swab is illegal data
[10:19:22] DanLGG: dasmehdi is a god tier role player. he plays Nino who was basically equal to lang in that business early 2.0. Lil tuggz a gang banger also in CG and Brian knight one of the scariest cops for criminals to be investigating by.

[10:20:19] FunkBish: NotLikeThis
[10:20:22] Sh4rkill3r: @Ruttiger64 yes. thats the point. but you cant force a reswab if you didnt do when due. you need to wait for next violent felony

[10:43:05] sKingNA: Casually refers to self in the 3rd person
[10:43:06] mwcarroll: @tanksly I think he's trying to say he has an alternate character that does crime, so he's in the know about stuff that he wouldn't be as just a cop

[10:44:01] kenpachi_san_: @harrytitsmitchell the build ones is what most people were talking and those are bought so their grandmas making ass gingerbread is a wrong statement
[10:44:02] SharkzGG_: @taraannee this, medhi can seperate after like 10 years of playing both sides haha
[10:44:02] arizonaowl: HUH
