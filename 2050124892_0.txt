[1:53:49] charybdes: If a person gets shot and a doctor pulls out the bullets can you get the bullets and test them?
[1:53:50] grrgoyle: So... like vest cams?
[1:53:53] AshesSruthan: do you think this will have a big impact on day to day stuff??

[1:54:11] ZachFromChat: It is an RP thing not an IRL thing chat. it makes the streamers lives easier as a replacement for real policing

[1:54:11] Dricera: What about knife/wrench where there's no casings or projectiles
[1:54:12] StevenB79: No more secretary needed
[1:54:13] narcolepticbusdriver: You'll need to boot up some Half Life Alyx to test that VR out.

[1:54:33] Mandrenn: huge win processing takes so long
[1:54:36] Gachiguru: the crims always want to go to trial thats why i takes forever
[1:54:39] EternalCoconut: Clap 35 instead of 45 minutes
[1:54:41] ZachFromChat: Its to help streamers, not cops
[1:54:41] Wheez_3D: The scene vr could have come in handy when the tanker exploded at mosley scene
[1:54:44] Eraborea: You've kinda never done it properly on 3.0 though have you?
[1:54:46] kevnfntastic: anything that reduces the jail cell rp is probably good for everyone
[1:54:47] SepheronXI: CHIEF CLETUS CORNWOOD 2024!!! GOATED
[1:54:47] AshesSruthan: hopefully, the processing time takes so damn long jail time seems pointless

[1:55:29] Beep_Cx: COGGERS
[1:55:32] EternalCoconut: @taraannee It really does though, it's boring for the cops too though. If you watch a crim, they're just sitting there for 30m+ while the cops have to type out an essay
[1:55:33] BoldSlowbro: missing details go back lol
[1:55:33] enfranchise_: I feel like that was one of the biggest time sinks, like cops were always writing reports and shit for an hour
[1:55:33] Ravionus: Will pictures taken at the scene show up with that VR system

[2:34:44] Pheyerus: clip was clear as day a bullet that went passed the mirror of the truck and hit top of tanker

[2:35:08] 31Fox: @Cornwood  I am pretty sure it was a remote detonation device .. maybe a mobile phone used to set off the tanker..  Proving no officer was in the wrong.
[2:35:09] Archangel3003: @CrystalDimension I wasn't the cop in that clip who shot it. Esfand slowed it down and you can see a shot come from behind him that seems to hit it
[2:35:11] msq_p: we have this same conversation every day Aware
[2:35:12] dapyman: The odd thing is the back of the tanker exploded, not the front of the tank

[2:59:20] Wandering_Ranger: @Archangel3003 yeah it's hard to tell honestly because there could be a delay in the explosion. But tbh I've watched from so many angles and I think it was one of those 2 regardless

[3:00:40] Archangel3003: @Wandering_Ranger Slasher still doesn't look like any of his shots went wide the truck though but could be like when people see things differently in game. Duncan lucky those shots were not lower of might have been friendly fire as well lol.

[7:03:19] catloyalist: Use flash light maybe
[7:03:20] CrystalDimension: @geckoguy69 they have different graphics settings, different mods installled, different resolutions and so on

[7:04:03] cheetobbob: broke bois 1080p users
[7:04:05] BlazeAndConfuse: it's another reason they should open up the north to spilt the population more
[7:04:07] Kirbyeatsplanets: 1440p and 2160p (4k) are not the same
[7:04:09] oofinside: knowing that you have 4090, its better on 1440

You get so into it that you yell and try to tell the players/people where to go or what to do. Its normal to do that. No ones treating it like irl. A lot of us will do this, so that we can be part of the conversation & show that we're listening and can relate.

[9:18:04] gimmedacheekz: @cordysan we all acknowledge its a video game. A lot of us are invested in the storyline to it all. Its like watching a tv show, a movie, or a sports game. You get so into it that you yell and try to tell the players/people where to go or what to do. Its normal to do that. No ones treating it like irl. A lot of us will do this, so that we can be part of the conversation & show that we're listening and can relate.

[12:00:43] LogicWeasel: the old PD had absent leadership
[12:00:44] puppietreats: Prayge my insistent need to hope for unrealistic things is praying anthony copleone jr becomes pd

[12:00:46] Jeremyohno: Yeah you need them for sure. Just not 4/10 at a time
[12:00:47] BlazeAndConfuse: there needs to be a middle ground

[12:00:49] usernamethatistosapproved: ya but they give out daps like candy so wtf can pd do
[12:00:49] bluej255: I agree with the dap falls off with x amount of hours worked
[12:00:50] AbeFroman2: i think its poor timing to be doing daps
[12:00:50] Switchblade142: I think its because you can literally get like 5 daps at a time which is crazy. It's not something that you see until it happens to you if that makes sense.
[12:00:52] DayStryderz: did DoC ever get hired back?
[12:00:53] cyb3rpan1c: @meathead_48 never said otherwise ;)

[12:00:54] danny_yel: daps are fine if you have competent captains

[12:00:56] Nova__Cannon: Downside is who DAPS a Captain if they make a bad call
[12:00:56] LogicWeasel: but at least the cptns are typically on and accountable in this PD
[12:00:57] Cat_God22: a little Samuel would be a good to relieve stress on the pd

[12:01:09] gobbagooey: @machiavellithefat I would honestly say Rhodes is prob best driver
[12:01:09] 360ski: You done Esfand?
[12:01:10] mercs99: DAPs dont solve that, firing people who refuse to improve or who are problematic does. you dont need a point system at a real life job, but if you fuck up bad enough or frequently enough you get fired
[12:01:13] RLOskorge: do daps ever fall off? @EsfandTV
[12:01:14] itisacar: the judge at that court case told slacks DAPs is some kindergarden shit
[12:01:14] SmugPls: you shouldnt be able to get multiple daps for one situation
[12:01:15] RunicCrustacean: dap right now are too hardcore . they need to find a middle ground
[12:01:16] knowlightnofear: On the positive... No body got mugged while you were role playing

[12:01:23] ZenBanditX22: 60 days is like 2 years los santons time tho
[12:01:23] RexPappa: Its hard, the PD has no direction and I dont blame anyone in particular its multiple things
[12:01:24] DazedenConfused: Cops need a lawyer that can dispute DAP points
[12:01:24] kosmojono: yo esfand HYPERYump
[12:01:27] Vengy: Daps just need to last for 20 days than fall off.
[12:01:28] randybobndyphone: Not enough 15 hours yet lmao
[12:01:29] TakeAChance: @matanzlatan2000 I was watching his stream the other day and he said he’s going gloves off with shit. I hope slacks getting shot really kicks him into gear
[12:01:31] Chonkiermilk: The idea isnt to ride your DaP line, it's to not get DaPs because they should make the server better. sometimes they are handed out too often but its a good system
[12:01:31] cedemusic: they just waiting out there
[12:01:36] Mawzze: @tys0nnnnn why tomorrow?
[12:01:38] destinygun: @EsfandTV Daps are fine but talk to them and if they do the same mistake again dap them they are just throwing daps which is weird
[12:01:39] legobind: yeah we still got 6 more hours
[12:01:41] DarthRupert: DAPs are being used for "learning" when they should only be used for punishment. That's really the issue with the current system.
[12:01:46] Vikairius: I'll say it again, a Dap requires a retraining program that once finished removes the dap. It doesn't have to be anything intense either. The retraining could just be a ride along with a Sgt or Cpt
[12:01:48] taraannee: no wayyy penny has to run back to mrpd LUL LUL

[14:22:50] Jxckkooo: ive heard so much shit about ruth why is she not fired
[14:22:52] Vexamas: @Vexamas I guess I'm more or less surprised nobody has been able to sit down and articulate the issues one piece at a time, almost every conversation devolves away from the point and circles a drain and nothing gets resolved.

[14:25:25] LavosTRD: the quality FTO's from 3.0 should have been approved from the get go, having timbal and snow make new characters now and try to play catch up on training is too little too late.
[14:25:25] cawood899: @GoutOfWar and maybe cops are meant to stop robbers 4Shrug

[14:25:57] GoutOfWar: @cawood899 sure but after the fact, cops would never camp a mechanic for example
[14:25:57] matanzlatan2000: @Seetherrr cheever7 does great job playing a villian and nobody should hate her, but ruth as a character is terrible ice queen thats ruining the PD, its literally her rp.
[14:25:58] Clodhoppr: how about that surrounded situation either Denzel earlier when you couldn’t do nothing
[14:25:58] Cenar96: 911 respondes are terrible 60% of the time no police shows up
[14:26:00] sunlitebro: priotize THIS

[14:26:05] RavagedPistol: they refuse to hire experienced cops makes literally no sense
[14:26:05] BlazeAndConfuse: you should tell how you got boxed in by 4 cars and got zero backup
[14:26:06] snusge: OKEY
[14:26:08] amayerstatue: Ruth and everything wouldn't be a problem if there was an alternative to the PD, right?
[14:26:12] Alexpcorbin: Some of this is growing pains from 4.0 new crime, PD overload.
[14:26:15] Grilbur: Talk about you and den being surrounded with no backup
[14:26:20] TimmayHS: you got boxed by damn australians without any radio response
[14:26:22] xxlonegunmanxx: Crims go 3 hours without seeing a cop, and complain.
[14:26:24] Vikairius: that isn't even accounting for the false reports coming into 911 now
[14:26:25] taraannee: omg yes i forgot about the aussie situation earlier was sooo bad
