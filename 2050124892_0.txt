[1:53:07] SavageTarzan: @Speeddevilx, hmjj he usually has TTS off during RP because people have been doing it at inopportune times
[1:53:09] lolheads580r: Listening
[1:53:16] jukla12: @Gachiguru MOM JOKE POGGING

[1:53:20] grrgoyle: @EsfandTV Sorry, just wondering how it gets the imagery of the scene in the first place.
[1:53:21] sterred: @Gachiguru my mom died 2 months ago
[1:53:22] TONK: it's just easier to look at than the photos covered in numbers
[1:53:23] TheKarmaHunter: Give Cornwood some pearl earrings, he deserves it.
[1:53:24] NoorIsAwsome: Does it strain your voice doing Cornwood‚Äôs Southern accent?
[1:53:25] UncleTahko: Ramee gonna lose it if he finds out
[1:53:32] xcynicul: does those markers pop up for crims too like could they conceal their own evidence?
[1:53:33] moodymellow: @EsfandTV does it take a simulation/picture of the scene or will you be able to see people around in current time?
[1:53:33] tyrannuswrecked: Do you think the crime scene VR shows people there in the current scene?
[1:53:34] TheGhostlyOnyx: @Gachiguru Sadge
[1:53:35] ScreenFresh: evidence wasnt auto added to report in 3.0?
[1:53:37] benjono_c8: Smadge Mom, the cops are using technology Smadge
[1:53:39] sirachalife: Before ppl didnt attach evidence making linking cases hard, now evidence auto sorts
[1:53:41] warner05: Please check the Twatter Furry Pic bro.  Im dying here LUL @esfandtv
[1:53:41] Speeddevilx: Cheer100 Cheer100 this message goes to cornwood, can i ask you why do you have 5 guns in your locker mr corn wood when you only have two hands? How do you shoot the other 3? please describe in detail mr wood.
[1:53:49] charybdes: If a person gets shot and a doctor pulls out the bullets can you get the bullets and test them?
[1:53:50] grrgoyle: So... like vest cams?
[1:53:53] AshesSruthan: do you think this will have a big impact on day to day stuff??
[1:53:55] ArmyOfFutsak: how will glocks with no serial number work will they work the same or are those guns pure gold now

[1:54:07] Kaztiell: saving time writing reports, damn thats to power full for pd, reports should take time!! D: D: D:
[1:54:11] ZachFromChat: It is an RP thing not an IRL thing chat. it makes the streamers lives easier as a replacement for real policing
[1:54:11] froogo0: Less report, more RP Pog
[1:54:11] Dricera: What about knife/wrench where there's no casings or projectiles
[1:54:12] StevenB79: No more secretary needed
[1:54:13] narcolepticbusdriver: You'll need to boot up some Half Life Alyx to test that VR out.
[1:54:13] Balir: it took out a lot of the tedium of being a cop
[1:54:14] blahder: Less annoying = improved moral
[1:54:18] Smoogol: Aware maybe murphy was innocent
[1:54:19] shikari07: Is it the same locker as evidence before? or a different locker?
[1:54:20] Zhachi1250: Reports will just say "Check the VR 4Head "
[1:54:21] Speeddevilx: -300 lol

[1:54:33] Mandrenn: huge win processing takes so long
[1:54:36] Gachiguru: the crims always want to go to trial thats why i takes forever
[1:54:39] EternalCoconut: Clap 35 instead of 45 minutes
[1:54:41] ZachFromChat: Its to help streamers, not cops
[1:54:41] Wheez_3D: The scene vr could have come in handy when the tanker exploded at mosley scene
[1:54:44] Eraborea: You've kinda never done it properly on 3.0 though have you?
[1:54:46] kevnfntastic: anything that reduces the jail cell rp is probably good for everyone
[1:54:47] SepheronXI: CHIEF CLETUS CORNWOOD 2024!!! GOATED
[1:54:47] AshesSruthan: hopefully, the processing time takes so damn long jail time seems pointless
[1:54:48] knowlightnofear: CRIMS just whine more now
[1:54:50] clowniusthe1st: trial = no jail EZ
[1:54:51] BurgGolf: can you pull dna off the used bullet?
[1:54:53] meathead_48: BatChest CG WAKE UP SOON

[1:54:55] bobdang07hd: holy turbos
[1:54:57] grrgoyle: @EsfandTV Yeah, I TOTALLY get that. It's a pain to watch too. :D Just thinking in terms of how the scene is captured for VR.

[1:55:21] shin5sato3: why go to jail for 5 minutes when you can do a bench trial for 3 hours?
[1:55:21] moodymellow: Because they're busy typing shit down lol
[1:55:23] Kurxx: yup
[1:55:26] TheGhostlyOnyx: @knowlightnofear end of 3.0 was really bad PD would just spam EMP gun on everything
[1:55:27] rabbyraptor: @Mystikalrush Same
[1:55:28] Mayorthis555: @EternalCoconut better then 55....
[1:55:29] Beep_Cx: COGGERS
[1:55:32] EternalCoconut: @taraannee It really does though, it's boring for the cops too though. If you watch a crim, they're just sitting there for 30m+ while the cops have to type out an essay
[1:55:33] BoldSlowbro: missing details go back lol
[1:55:33] enfranchise_: I feel like that was one of the biggest time sinks, like cops were always writing reports and shit for an hour
[1:55:33] Ravionus: Will pictures taken at the scene show up with that VR system
[1:55:35] Llamatude: Report RP
[1:55:41] taraannee: @tyrannuswrecked literally heard streamers say that watching their stream.. didnt say it was all of them

[2:33:42] doobcs: whoever was directly in front of the cab shot it
[2:33:48] Pruder8: @EsfandTV someone had a bad shot that backed up to the tanker. I don't think the tanker showing the flaming gas leaking animation because of some scuff.
[2:33:48] ape2gethrstronge: one of the shots from the officer in front of the semi firing hit the tanker
[2:33:48] puppietreats: @lucki_____ K said he was going to shoot the tank, but it exploded before he did

[2:35:08] 31Fox: @Cornwood  I am pretty sure it was a remote detonation device .. maybe a mobile phone used to set off the tanker..  Proving no officer was in the wrong.
[2:35:09] Archangel3003: @CrystalDimension I wasn't the cop in that clip who shot it. Esfand slowed it down and you can see a shot come from behind him that seems to hit it

[5:29:09] Vikairius: @kiester_felterbutts probably low priority
[5:29:09] HumblePhil: There should be a way to remove daps too
[5:29:09] Druedog: need more dabs and less daps
[5:29:15] EsmanTV: McNulty with you about the shooting from weapon was the best way to about it
[5:29:19] Wandering_Ranger: I think there needs to be guidlelines on what you can get DAPs for so that people understand what they are actually doing wrong
[5:29:20] EthanGinger20: Duncaning peeTime
[5:29:22] fenrrs: @Vanguard771 it is completely unbalanced
[5:29:23] miketwng: @Jeremyohno Denzel has 9

[5:29:40] TheLadyCupcake: Susge so its his fault?
[5:29:42] TheMah1337: DAP's are fine in general, it's just the ammount and  there are certain things that shouldn't be DAP worthy
[5:29:44] greyjulian: @jeremyohno don‚Äôt worry Den Zel, Aziz, or Cornwood will get there soon
[5:29:45] Smoogol: Wokege

[5:30:01] EthanGinger20: BONNESS
[5:30:04] fatalnightshade: They got the stick but where is the carrot... They need some kind of reward for the good officers
[5:30:08] Architank: 60 days is WAY too long
[5:30:10] bertacharm: or way to work them off
[5:30:12] fenrrs: they are handed out way too easily
[5:30:14] Druedog: @ZodyacPT I mean dabbing on people, not these kids smoking
[5:30:20] theegoomba: theyre adding classes to reduce daps
[5:30:21] Honorspren: but at the same time getting 4 daps from one incident is insane
[5:30:21] Kelborn: The problem is the crims have no system, their system is the PD and the PD isnt keeping up
[5:30:22] condor2104: DAPS are fine its how they are implemented that can be changed
[5:30:24] miketwng: Exactly, DAPs then correction
[5:30:25] Mic_Stargazer: If it's not implemented it means the DAP system isn't even "complete"
[5:30:25] spazticbull: is 60 days on server or 60 days irl??
[5:30:27] Perterter: YES! That's what they do for people who work on airfields. 3 BORs and you need to retrain
[5:30:29] nosticktoaster: why not just fire someone if they have 60 strikepoints wtf LUL
[5:30:29] dannorexx: 4 daps at once is crazy tho
[5:30:31] Architank: Every DAP should be a captain meeting.
[5:30:33] CrystalDimension: DAPs are not the problem but HOW they are given away like candy
[5:30:34] Architank: @spazticbull IRL
[5:30:39] Vexiaaa: But is it getting out of hand? Do people want to participate with so much stress about DABS?
[5:30:42] imSteffin: @spazticbull, irl
[5:30:42] RexPappa: Shit this is the opp
[5:30:45] Edward_Theodore: 60days IRL
[5:30:46] Recon_XoX: DAPS are fine but they are handing them out like candy and not giving people a way to redeem themselves
[5:30:47] spazticbull: @Vanguard771 thans
[5:30:54] Kaisenjin: @Wandering_Ranger But there are guidelines, but there were people who received Daps before a guideline was written OMEGALAUGHING
[5:31:15] dannorexx: if den did that that would've been like +4 DAPS
[5:31:17] imfukinlost: make them study what they did wrong and brief it in pd meeting if they get in trouble if they do it again dap
[5:31:18] PacGamer: YEP
[5:31:19] DaltonCL: Cough Ruth
[5:31:25] Mogvvai4Sale: A bop on the nose will either result in an obedient doggo or an aggressive one.

[5:31:35] Rockshock: Not gonna lie, If you got 9 daps, I dont think the system change woulda helped you. It's probalby you being the issue
[5:31:44] hereforff9: i think the driving word in the demerit system is merit
[5:31:48] mizkifsrecedinghairline: Cornwood is 2 hours of policing and 12 hours of complaining about the PD  xdd

[5:32:19] Xierany: @Rockshock When you don't understand what you did wrong most of the time it only works to demotivate people
[5:32:21] Clodhoppr: what about being dapped without the SOP or a warning
[5:32:22] CrystalDimension: but there are NO WARNINGS this time LUL
[5:32:23] miketwng: sup jimmy

[5:32:29] bertacharm: yeah where are the warnings?
[5:32:35] quaylewastaken: We're were the warnings
[5:32:36] Kelborn: @Rockshock problem is Cornwood has 6 or 7 and we dont even know why he got the first 3. He was just told, "some people said that you said some things that made them feel bad" like how non comittal and nebulous is that?

I'm confused is the whole PD in on some sort of bit because a lot of the people seem legit uptight and at times malicious towards your character. Have you actually been promoted and it's all a bit or are they rank locking Cornwood? It honestly seems like the PD needs change soon because as a viewer it's kind of miserable.

[12:00:49] bluej255: I agree with the dap falls off with x amount of hours worked
[12:00:50] AbeFroman2: i think its poor timing to be doing daps
[12:00:50] Switchblade142: I think its because you can literally get like 5 daps at a time which is crazy. It's not something that you see until it happens to you if that makes sense.

[12:01:09] 360ski: You done Esfand?
[12:01:10] mercs99: DAPs dont solve that, firing people who refuse to improve or who are problematic does. you dont need a point system at a real life job, but if you fuck up bad enough or frequently enough you get fired
[12:01:13] RLOskorge: do daps ever fall off? @EsfandTV
[12:01:14] itisacar: the judge at that court case told slacks DAPs is some kindergarden shit
[12:01:14] SmugPls: you shouldnt be able to get multiple daps for one situation

[12:01:23] RexPappa: Its hard, the PD has no direction and I dont blame anyone in particular its multiple things
[12:01:24] DazedenConfused: Cops need a lawyer that can dispute DAP points
[12:01:24] kosmojono: yo esfand HYPERYump
[12:01:27] Vengy: Daps just need to last for 20 days than fall off.
[12:01:28] randybobndyphone: Not enough 15 hours yet lmao
[12:01:29] TakeAChance: @matanzlatan2000 I was watching his stream the other day and he said he‚Äôs going gloves off with shit. I hope slacks getting shot really kicks him into gear
[12:01:31] Chonkiermilk: The idea isnt to ride your DaP line, it's to not get DaPs because they should make the server better. sometimes they are handed out too often but its a good system
[12:01:31] cedemusic: they just waiting out there
[12:01:36] Mawzze: @tys0nnnnn why tomorrow?
[12:01:38] destinygun: @EsfandTV Daps are fine but talk to them and if they do the same mistake again dap them they are just throwing daps which is weird
[12:01:39] legobind: yeah we still got 6 more hours
[12:01:41] DarthRupert: DAPs are being used for "learning" when they should only be used for punishment. That's really the issue with the current system.
[12:01:46] Vikairius: I'll say it again, a Dap requires a retraining program that once finished removes the dap. It doesn't have to be anything intense either. The retraining could just be a ride along with a Sgt or Cpt
[12:01:48] taraannee: no wayyy penny has to run back to mrpd LUL LUL
[12:01:51] matanzlatan2000: @TakeAChance it seems it has yeah, we'll see.

Maybe you get put on desk duty and have to review and clean up reports, Maybe you have to spend time as dispatch. Shit like that.
