[1:19:21] RadicalLynx: ggeeCry
[1:19:36] Nightjar: It usually starts about 2ish minutes from the end of the video, which is why videos under that can break cinema sometimes
[1:19:37] MyBlackCat: You should find a moderator in australia

[1:25:46] Nightjar: I just can't listen to Robin again LUL
[1:26:05] psykhohedgehog: Robin is a blessing. It brings us all warmth. Some of us, like me, are empowered by the sudden intense rise of sheer murderous intent and desire to commit war crimes.
[1:26:38] the_void__: As funny as Robin is, the Zoey/Bouphe duel is my favorite part of this episode
[1:26:48] psykhohedgehog: -Starts up RimWorld.-
[1:26:57] psykhohedgehog: Same.

[1:42:04] T2Needles: and then it buffers monkaS hopefully its just the usual starting buffer and wont continue throughout the vid

[1:43:14] MyBlackCat: smii7yNETB
[1:43:35] MyBlackCat: Buffering
[1:43:49] psykhohedgehog: I want Cinema to not be sick, Nightjar. Cinema needs to be healthy so everyone can be happy.
[1:44:04] Nightjar: NOPERS you can't get everything
[1:44:23] Nightjar: Cinema has a stutter and everyone needs to be patient with him NODDERS
[1:44:26] RufusTheHairyCatWrangler: I'll take the buffering. Buffering might sort itself out after a while, no cinema is kind of final
[1:44:37] MyBlackCat: smii7yECONOMY2
[1:44:40] psykhohedgehog: yogHands I know. I don't want to be sickly, but I am sickly.
[1:44:45] Nightjar: !notlive
[1:44:46] JaffaMod: This isn't live, it's YogsCinema, a place where chat can vote on and watch Yogscast Youtube videos together! Use !howtovote in chat to learn how to vote, and ping a mod on the Yogs discord if cinema is misbehaving. Check out our regular schedule at schedule.yogscast.com!
[1:45:10] Nightjar: @psykhohedgehog hnyHug so we must embrace cinema as he is
