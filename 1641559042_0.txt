[5:04:39] guyman3090: @ankshiz yes it is
[5:04:45] SirMoistTowelette: @CurtisRyan Vitamix is a crazy powered blender, it will pulverize anything you put into it. I use mine almost daily. Add your ingredients, come back in 5 minutes, it will be piping hot. Also use it to make ice cream, protein shakes, salsa, etc
[5:05:03] tallassmike: yeah vitamix prob for the creamy soups, like butternut squash
[5:05:17] AreYouSeriousRightNow_: wait piping hot from the friction of blending it? or is there a heating element to it?
[5:05:19] AreYouSeriousRightNow_: Hmmm
[5:05:39] SirMoistTowelette: @tallassmike absolutely, you ain't making a stew or noodle soup in vitamix, creams only - cheddar brocolli is my go to, or pizza soup
[5:06:09] ankshiz: shoko
[5:06:18] SirMoistTowelette: @AreYouSeriousRightNow_ friction, its actually stupid crazy how well it works, but its louder then most blenders due to the oversized like motor
[5:06:29] AreYouSeriousRightNow_: thats pretty crazy
[5:06:33] tallassmike: i like homemade chili, add some starch or flour to thicken it up
[5:06:52] tallassmike: but i cut back the amount of ground beef the thing asks for
[5:06:58] SirMoistTowelette: just talkinga bout it now, i think i'm gonna make blender soup this weekend
[5:07:15] tallassmike: chili with cornbread
