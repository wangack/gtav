[5:20:11] simmeringteapot: 3 gpu is a great deal, idk why Eugene is taking it so personal
[5:20:14] evilmoose__: Every attempt to get a usb cost 75 buttC. It could be multiple attempts to get purple
[5:20:14] Dumi90: what meta bro
[5:20:14] Madknightwolf: Yeah Eugene is treating deal like he was treating company
[5:20:14] cebron808: eugene holding on to grudges aint gonna help in the longrun

[5:20:49] qhrizo777: @MRAPL saying dont rob us anymore.
[5:20:55] Supersamss: they also fucked your heist, so if they wanna make up for it they could give 1usb for free
[5:20:56] lrcifuu: we don't need to use 75 butcoin again

[5:23:04] cebron808: eugene omg
[5:23:09] Riskaken: OOF
[5:23:10] adamm220: @sssacrifixe thats nothing to do with them, thats because the progression is halted by lack of mats
[5:23:12] Alonort00: nmpOOF
[5:23:13] Tuga_cef: @Zeynlol the logic in this comment

[6:07:10] slicedloxonasiago: @DJ_Jenks So, i am not a physical therapist, but you might want to give one a holler about really heavy leg presses. the thing about LP versus squat is that in squat you back in limiting factor for your knees, so your not usually going to crush your knees with it since your back fails first. In LP your back is supported totally and it allows you to way overload knees
[6:07:11] nonnahshannon: shake Marie
