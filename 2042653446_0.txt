[5:38:50] mystic_drewman: Game crashes a bit often
[5:38:51] The_Herkin: It's why I loved Conan Exiles so much, unreal engine
[5:39:25] The_Herkin: The community server has reset itself a few times, but I haven't had the game full on crash on me
[5:39:32] mystic_drewman: Darthbobo has a friend with a server I'm sure you could play on
[5:39:33] DeadwolfVoV: Server files have a mem leak but other than that, no crashes, just weird bugs you gota relog for
[5:39:33] Empirics_: I have 50ish hours into it and it has crashed a grand total of once when I got stuck in terrain

[5:41:26] mystic_drewman: Ah makes sense then
[5:41:28] Sovitus: Pokemon Ark of the Wild
[5:41:53] mystic_drewman: It's like rust meets fortnite and ark
