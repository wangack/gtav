[6:19:55] Seetherrr: Was there a change to cars? I heard different people mentioning different cars seemed faster.  But one of the things I've seen is that in a lot of chases the  crim cars either had no chance vs PD cars or the PD cars had no chance, didn't seem like there were many "equal" pursuits. But that might have changed.
[6:19:56] Annonc: robbing people would be better if people have cash in hand more often, dunno how you make that happen when there is mobile pays tho
