[2:41:08] c0rnishatheart: what the hell
[2:41:10] m1tchole: Littering is a gateway crime to jaywalking
[2:41:20] Mac_Parts: How why?
[2:41:22] theblackdog808: do people drop them here? lol
[2:41:22] WatermelonCrunch: is illegal dumping a charge? KEKW @Ssaab
[2:41:23] puppietreats: might as well be the landfill lol

[2:43:07] lookingfornothinghere: wait wouldnt she like litters? they give her a jobHmmm
[2:43:09] SmugPls: Lenny a true patriot out here suggesting dna for littering
[2:43:53] fishnchips333: that cops great but my god hes so ugly its hard to look at him
[2:44:20] Mac_Parts: In all honesty? You could honestly charge someone with a littering with how bad that area got. If you find DNA on any of those items you easily get someone. Is that a charge in the MTD?
[2:44:38] talamah: LULE
[2:44:52] enzation: i thought the trash randomly spawn
[2:44:52] 1TrueTyrant: is ssaab mowing the lawn?
[2:45:00] strawberryraye: your car sounds like neighbor’s lawn mower
[2:45:01] fishnchips333: so what counters are being implemented with dna? gloves work? certain outfits? @Ssaab
[2:45:04] diabolik_lord: @Mac_Parts I would say dna on 2-3 items would be good for a charge
[2:45:08] falcodark: moon was saying its probably a grinder powergaming cause the trash becomes bags for sanitations
[2:45:10] bur9four: put it in reverse terry
[2:45:10] powerpuncher24: was that from acutally people?
[2:45:11] ultrachauuud: I think he was thinking in an "admin" sense? But maybe both
[2:45:12] Mac_Parts: With multiple charges can you give jail time? Lol.
[2:45:13] puppietreats: @lookingfornothinghere i think when it’s just a couple pieces of litter, it’s less money for sanitation?
[2:45:22] pokefwends: take away DAPs for those not stacked
[2:45:25] SarahFlare: saabDap2

[2:46:15] PolygonStatic: All those blips at mrpd KEKW
[2:46:15] 1TrueTyrant: by hitting them where it hurts, specific patrols duty, foot patrol, 2 hours in snr buns, 2 in the sani yard, 2 in the g6 spot
[2:46:41] Landoram: take a screenshot of the map with them stacked and discuss in meeting
[2:46:51] 1TrueTyrant: RP cops have waaay too much freedom when it comes to patroling
[2:46:56] NumbLee: Having the FTO reports in game is neat. Makes the whole process seem less OOC
[2:47:11] loveoverfearkiwtll: Assign cops to different parts of the city
[2:47:41] Eddie1225: duncan

[2:48:16] Vengy: god damn
[2:48:16] c0rnishatheart: I would make it so you dont get paid in MRPD so they stack elsewhere
[2:48:17] freen87: call an emergency meeting to all the cops in the Mission PD area
[2:48:18] King_Rexy: Isn't that what a cop is LUL
[2:48:19] puppietreats: when are that many officers even on at once,,, i
[2:48:20] 1TrueTyrant: 2 WORDS, FOOT PATROLS,
[2:48:20] tinstarfish99: Is anyone out patrolling?
[2:48:22] TheLastRace: Problem is they start with a quick side conversation and the RP grows from there and the conversations drag on
[2:48:24] AfroAltruism: this a put ur boot down moment KEKL
[2:48:27] FinexLive: @Ssaab slacks we are missing people in the pd please recruit LULW

[3:07:22] wildarrow88: Is Slacks solo?
[3:07:27] soupnattzi: Holy 🤣
[3:07:40] Mac_Parts: Is this the first time you heard that? I work in the STEM field and it is a huge problem with us getting younger people to be interested. It has been brought that it is more attractive for younger people to be interesting in influencer etc.
[3:07:42] yo_who_asked: nun-ya business?
[3:07:42] PolygonStatic: right, entertainment is always evolving, and but how the industry operates in general has always kinda been the same
[3:07:51] TheLastRace: @wildarrow88 He has a cadet, think wirting a report
[3:07:53] ShadesDown: it’s just the natural order of things changing. as society got more technology based those kind of pop culture things became prevalent
[3:07:59] Mac_Parts: @yo_who_asked Nun-ya problem.

[3:09:29] Pravolution: 5 or 7 is a pretty big range
[3:09:33] pokefwends: i've heard it's pretty common for kids to want to be youtubers/streamers these days

[3:11:40] PolygonStatic: Dundee LUL
[3:11:45] Mac_Parts: I personally dont find it a problem when kids are into engineering base YouTubers. That is because it gets them interested in the STEM field. It is a problem when they find they think that "other" content is a "attractive". I think that Florida is trying to pass a law so that you have to be 16+ to have social media.

[6:02:31] Drkdream: you better have enough snacks for everyone saabStare @Ssaab
[6:02:33] lookingfornothinghere: @ssaab maybe have evidence get placed with extra gloves instead flashlights bc pd uses the flashlight for a lot
[6:02:36] TakenxOver: Hmm slacks what you snacking on? did you bring enough for the class?
[6:02:47] WATERMELONFRESH: cleaning blood with no bleach? maybe a little too easy Hmmm

[6:03:03] MrBASins: corn wood was doing it the other day
[6:03:05] lizardeyes: organ harvesting with cute voices
[6:03:07] wavep987: once tagged, evidence maybe should have a quick despawn time
[6:03:08] DanLGG: Yeah I think the hospital needs a code to clean the floors every 30 minutes or something. like an rp rumba so it doesn’t stack
[6:03:25] ClipsBott: {Use ' !clip  [title] ' command to create a clip that is automatically sent to the #twitchclips channel on Discord ClappyHype }
[6:03:38] dakota22446: PercAngle
[6:03:38] Seraphace: omg that's such a time saver and huge quality of life improvement, but it does have a blind spot, they should have an invisible timestamp on them, and make the action to pick them up check for time so it picks up according to "likely" shared time frame, so evidence for 2 crimes don't automatically mix because of badly implmented mechanic
[6:03:39] lizardeyes: neat
[6:03:50] dakota22446: uuh
[6:03:55] Xastin3: period rp LUL

[6:04:26] lizardeyes: watched too much evil dead they did
[6:04:30] lookingfornothinghere: PD uses flashlights for a lot of things so they place the evidence stuff all over the place KEKW
[6:04:37] Welshstig: stitch up her wound FeelsWeirdMan
[6:04:46] DanLGG: A blood roomba for the hospital is what we need
[6:05:10] DaelinT: Not sure about WL, but on public there is blood everywhere in Snr Buns as well
[6:05:16] Xastin3: snr dishwasher
[6:05:43] DonNiko99: Did you get a fine?
[6:05:43] DaelinT: Roaches in the hospital, ewwww

[6:06:21] dakota22446: PauseMan
[6:06:25] Seraphace: can also make an command from inventory which "disposes of the item" where using a similar but dichotimized function as the ability to permanently leave persisting items on the server as per your tech, you could now set something down to dispose and essentially self destruct in 30 mins, with ever s o slightly graphical enhancements which make it more obvious to the eye searching for it
[6:06:28] ltl_wackman: NODDERS cop house, safety
[6:06:29] duckhunter_88: hell yeah
[6:06:32] ryanburd13: What kind of chips are you eating?
[6:06:36] lookingfornothinghere: PD Content House where they film Tiktoks and youtube vids BatChest
[6:06:37] GreenMonk: Be petty and dont pay him off the rest of the rent
[6:06:50] Seraphace: so that things can be disposed of, it grants a buff to people searching in the right area, and automatically garbage collects assets
[6:06:51] DaelinT: If only you can buy a house in Chumash, be a nice in between for city and Paleto
[6:06:56] lizardeyes: eaten beaver
