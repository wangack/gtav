[2:36:49] tinytoadtiddies: like kraytor sellin top for more
[2:36:53] irishnelly1: Siz has always been everybody eats mentality
[2:36:57] EvidentGhost: i feel like the biggest issue is making sure prices aren't too high people just think "screw that, i'll get donuts" Sadge
[2:37:06] ka1o5: It's competing with nearly free items too
[2:37:10] meisterofwhiff: 60 - 75
[2:37:13] Necro_Ex_Mortis: Lol Mehdi is like 3 mai tais in
[2:37:22] tinytoadtiddies: thats why siz is trusted with this meth bus, everyone eats with him in charge
[2:37:24] 3spada_Grande: Is the big house for sale KEKLEO
[2:37:34] glasses_Blac: @evidentghost unless donuts gets nerfed people are gonna be like that regardless
[2:37:35] 14tth: Drug lord RP lol. I adore the legit calculations you gotta do for this haha.
[2:37:38] coldxdte: 100 shouls be for 1000
[2:37:42] EvidentGhost: @3spada_Grande nah LUL they checked it a while ago
[2:37:44] CappuccinoCup: donuts dont make u a terminator
[2:37:45] coldxdte: should
[2:37:51] harthitman: Eeee
[2:37:59] harthitman: uhnGiga uhnGiga
[2:37:59] JungleG: as good as that 68% was you could make it simple and do $10 per 1% i.e, $600 for a bag of 60%, $1,000 for 100% but you ggotta test the market obv
[2:37:59] ShaydsTheRogue: donuts won't help you in a gun fight. a 4 man crew smokes meth before shit pops off it's almost an guaranteed victory
[2:38:06] c6r1s: plus donuts are just speed buff not bullet resistances like the meth
[2:38:07] 420thMagicMan: Based on Nino’s reaction it seems that players will be a lot more addicted than locals
[2:38:10] coldxdte: 100%
[2:38:12] harthitman: uhnGiga
[2:38:16] kristen_kross: @CappuccinoCup unless they're made of meth
[2:38:24] PickledWolverine: 10 dollars every percent ez
[2:38:31] harthitman: HypePotion
[2:38:32] omlyn: 8 to 10$ x % quality sounds like it could be good for you
[2:38:33] xcrash283x: i love that nin can stay ic so well while being drunk lol
[2:38:35] Pappa__Goose: Maybe have pricing like grading. Pricing for C batch’s (60-75), B batches (76-85) and A batches (86-95) and something for like 95-100
[2:38:37] thepianorcazul: I feel like finding out how everything is gonna work and figuring out what yall are doing with it makes the Rp much more enjoyable.
[2:39:07] 14tth: @Pappa__Goose that makes a lot of sense actually lol.
[2:39:11] EvidentGhost: @glasses_Blac yeaaaaah especially with the economy i guess...
[2:39:17] Ultimatestrife: maybe the big secret is the ones who make the meth can't sell it on the streets for the best profit, and maybe an outside seller may get double, etc.
[2:39:22] LolmanScott: just wanna see this stuff on the streets
[2:39:28] LolmanScott: i*
[2:39:32] irishnelly1: I do like 100 being exclusive for CG plans and shit, at least for the rp
[2:39:34] Tweker: cant wait to see the cop's reaction to first seeing meth being used
[2:39:35] coldxdte: meth ceo
[2:39:44] Raichulula: cops would freak out if they saw that right now
[2:39:44] harthitman: Meff
[2:39:45] Dezerman: did you time how long it lasted or him??
[2:39:49] 14tth: Because there's probably going to be so much variation in production varying the price would be too problematic. Just keeping it bracketed would be safer
[2:39:51] Tweker: 4 minutes @Dezerman
[2:39:56] tinytoadtiddies: man if you had 4 methed out the police will certainly have their hands full LOL
[2:40:00] Dezerman: nice
[2:40:02] LolmanScott: ye ye just excited is all
[2:40:02] Kamitcha: What I miss since the chat with nino
[2:40:02] NashquttinLittleWolf: with that shit I wouldn't doubt if the cops were the ones running away
[2:40:10] EvidentGhost: NODDERS
[2:40:20] friedmombo: NODDERS
[2:40:28] grimmghoulie: when the big boys need their shit, they contact the Big Cook
[2:40:31] thepianorcazul: Kermy is kinda yalls Saul Goodman
[2:40:33] Saiyan21: Dam so does this mean goodbye for the planned drops?
[2:40:38] ShaydsTheRogue: it will be tough, there is no market for it and little spare cash currently for people to allocate to an emerging market. but time will change that
[2:40:40] SleepPyro: !uptime
[2:40:41] ka1o5: house robbery vs the vault
[2:40:41] Nightbot: UberHaxorNova has been live for 2 hours 41 minutes
[2:40:43] Raichulula: CG, Flippy and Vagos sometimes? for 100%
[2:40:47] DieselPoweredWankle: and they can afford it too
[2:40:52] 0xygenhomie: if people wanna payfor 100%, who cares what their status is lol
[2:40:55] Twssler: Does the meth have Powers at different tiers?
[2:40:55] imdeatht1: Is this kind of difference gonna mean messing up batches on purpose for lower grade meth eventually
[2:40:56] SHRAG0N: only 2 crew CG/ vagos may be
[2:40:59] x2penzx: i wonder how different % meth effects chips? the higher the % the more homicidal?
[2:41:02] kristen_kross: gotta master it
[2:41:03] tinytoadtiddies: ye really depends on whose willing to pay
[2:41:03] 14tth: HOA is not gonna be distributing right? There's gonna be dealers and you just just produce?
[2:41:09] glasses_Blac: @raichulula flip B maybe , flippy is retired uhnKek uhnKek
[2:41:10] irishnelly1: Yeah like rp wise 50 percent and below should be cornered, with the 4k buy in that doesent really work though
[2:41:28] Ultimatestrife: @14tth HOA isn't involved

[2:41:55] tinytoadtiddies: i see i see
[2:41:56] bearrynice: is the 100% that much better than the 60 %?
[2:41:58] ka1o5: It's not easy to make and a limited supply. Time is a big factor
[2:42:02] Devon4493: and that makes you high product worth more too
[2:42:04] glasses_Blac: @raichulula oh he will but at the moment flipB>>>>>
[2:42:08] FendiBull: Hey James, I wonder if my nephew still like you. :P
[2:42:09] Devon4493: cause there isnt as much

[6:02:33] epic_smee: @UberHaxorNova does purity have an effect on the benefits?

[6:03:33] xcurryricex: uhnHm
[6:03:40] Actual_Nicotine: Might be better to work in brackets of 10%, I mean the difference between 67% and 68% would be negligible

[6:03:50] syneesia: in before nino ded KEKW
[6:04:11] Tru7hyDv8: there goes cops
[6:04:26] epic_smee: charging on purity is kinda rough and complicated. i think the purity will come into play,if other methcooks start in the city . they will want to get ur stuff, if its better. @UberHaxorNova

[6:06:18] mota_vated: @uberhaxornova will you ever know the cap on each purity?
[6:06:27] Valaphar: for these first batches overcharging to make up the sunk costs seem reasonable imo also people need to view it as a buy in as you've said
[6:06:41] aigis_enjoyer69: are you the only one having this issue? @UberHaxorNova
[6:06:44] Valaphar: even for low % since they'll be building rep
[6:06:52] KingPresiden: @al3xand3r_alvar3z how would he know
[6:07:13] DrZombieGamer: you have bad it the most it seems. others are but not as often
[6:07:16] wryinw: changed your clothes, that's it
[6:07:17] epic_smee: @UberHaxorNova okay, gotcha. my point was that if u sell 40% for 200 and 80% for 300. it doesnt make much difference for the buyer,if he gets 300 for 40% and 400 for 80% from locals. but if it scales up that fast,i get ur point.
