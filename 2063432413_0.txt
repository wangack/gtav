[1:05:45] movin100: Those gun parts will be yoinked right after the cool down
[1:05:46] ss_dhillon: @da_beast_1713 sntWave
[1:05:48] zfalcorz: +
[1:05:52] dripydryp: till everyone is rich?
[1:05:53] zfalcorz: ++
[1:06:29] BakinPacman: yeah those gun parts are gonna be yoinked on cooldown
[1:06:43] Da_Beast_1713: Guns would cause people to beef over the littlest things
[1:07:06] zfalcorz: PD needs to be in a better state before more crime happens sadly
[1:07:23] FLv_Smoke: PD feels weak right now and it shows
[1:07:40] BanishedGinger: people will get more ballsy when they try to hit a lick to get a gun too
[1:07:45] BakinPacman: pd pacing is always a week or two behind
[1:07:51] BakinPacman: its just natural pacing
[1:08:02] LegallyStupid_: don't say that it's already so bad OMEGADANCEBUTFAST
[1:08:07] zfalcorz: I liked the idea but the growing has been really slow and the cars/tools are pretty awful or scuffy
[1:08:08] StreamElements:  Check out Silents youtube channel with stream VOD's and Variety games! https://www.youtube.com/@silentvariety
[1:08:12] ItsAHazardLife: I think pd doesn't have the structure or officers. I also feel the people in command are hurting the pd more than helping
[1:08:12] zmasheytv: g2 slapped faze easy win 2-0 first team into major
[1:08:16] Greent3a: they are very selective on who to bring in/back into PD
[1:08:18] AetherMana: Its pretty stacked in shift 2. IDK why they dont look at 1/3
[1:08:26] Da_Beast_1713: not a lot of people want to play cop cus of the state of it rn
[1:08:27] BakinPacman: shift 3 is getting solid
[1:08:47] BakinPacman: theres some really strong core showing up
[1:09:02] Death_The_Otter: A lot of cops don't want to go to shift 1 due to the captain lol
[1:09:06] Lozza_95: nodd
[1:09:08] StreamElements: Please be sure to follow my stream and enable notifications so you'll never miss when i go live!
[1:09:15] BakinPacman: yeah thats what delayed hiring and they are not gonna approve transfers iirc
[1:09:24] BakinPacman: they are hardball on that
[1:09:26] tristii: yea that's part of the issue they have rn, they hire cops for diff shifts but then they've been doing other shifts instead

[1:09:49] Lozza_95: definitely majority
[1:09:51] LuckyyCB: 70% atleast i'd say
[1:09:54] LegallyStupid_: depends on the time but i'd say like 70% NA
[1:10:03] ZenoflareZ: Need shift 0 with shift 3 focus
[1:10:15] rubyn0odle: never gonna happend
[1:10:17] BakinPacman: the people not showing up are basically the people who are not showing up on shift
[1:10:22] itzGilBi: nodd
[1:10:28] AetherMana: It also seems like alot of the old cops are crim maining this update
[1:10:30] tristii: they're picking and choosing when they want to be strict, it's been a very unfair playing field lol
[1:10:31] lucho724_: yup
[1:10:32] LegallyStupid_: 1000%
[1:10:37] ItsAHazardLife: even some captains have screwed up and not even got punished so it sets a bad example
[1:10:40] lucho724_: imo that's worse than just not showing up, you lied
[1:10:44] 2quixotic: Suarez is on the edge. he applied for shift 2 but goes into shift 1 barely shift 2
[1:10:55] Death_The_Otter: @AetherMana Because the odl cops are havign a hard time joining as the captains want new cops
[1:10:59] mutaint: they're punishing someone who signed up shift 2 but has mainly been shift 1
[1:11:05] BakinPacman: old cop stigma is bs
[1:11:09] axlbv: I also think that lots of people that got the opportunity dont enjoy cop rn
[1:11:17] BakinPacman: they have the ability to apply as a new character
[1:11:20] zfalcorz: they are talking about doing that
[1:11:31] lucho724_: and if he doesn't do it again, you don't allow him to apply to that shift anymore
[1:11:32] AfroKage_17: @death_the_otter they say that buh they also hired the olds cops too
[1:11:39] axlbv: thats true
[1:11:47] AetherMana: its a wasted slot for the people that actually do like cop
[1:11:59] Death_The_Otter: @AfroKage_17 Very few of them and that is because certain cops begged for them to be hired
[1:12:27] AfroKage_17: @death_the_otter ermm if they picked a lane and stuck to it... It wldnt have been an issue
[1:12:35] BakinPacman: i dont think people understand how old some cops are either
[1:12:38] zfalcorz: tbf playing cop right now in this environment is pretty rough, I can't blame folks for not wanting to
[1:12:44] Kulipso: jammin
[1:13:00] AfroKage_17: Also the few cops we are play now especially the FTO might burn out early
[1:13:11] BakinPacman: 3 months basically
[1:13:12] mutaint: a ton of the cadets have flaked too (or had irl stuff recently), worst for shift 3 but it's all shifts, and then others cant cut it as ppo so they're on the line
[1:13:13] Greent3a: they should not allow people to hold two government positions
[1:13:20] arocket25: it's a privilege to play cop imo
[1:13:25] devon_gibbons1345: it’s a snow day everone
[1:13:30] lucho724_: yah, every day cop gets better tbh
[1:13:33] zfalcorz: things are supposed to progress, but all their stuff hasn't really progressed other than some numbers
[1:13:35] lucho724_: as more shit happens
[1:13:37] r3_clay: i think they find it hard to be strict with cops. when they also have too few cops around. and that makes stuff awkward because some people think they/their cop are untouchable...
[1:13:58] tristii: i feel like them not wanting to hire everyone's existing cops and picking and choosing which older ones they wanted to allow was offputting for quite a few previous cop mains too tho

[1:14:15] BakinPacman: cop mains is a bad viewpoint

[1:14:42] ItsAHazardLife: I think 4.0 pd has so many flaws, but also 3.0 got super bad. it's a change that needs to be worked on.
[1:14:42] Death_The_Otter: A lot of shift 1 cops quit/changed shifts due to the captain that runs that shift
[1:14:50] AfroKage_17: True a lot of them complain about not being hired and when they get hired... They don't show up
[1:14:59] AetherMana: its the same thing as people want to be max rep in everything, but is limited to mechanics. Not everyone can get it
[1:15:05] r3_clay: @tristii i think they dont want all the old cops from the start. beacuse then the same things would happen what happened in 3.0, even if all the old cops make new characters. they want new roleplayers on cop, maybe mix in some old.
[1:15:06] AetherMana: or you cant do it all
[1:15:24] Flackzee: onx
[1:15:25] AfroKage_17: @death_the_otter like who?
[1:15:25] mutaint: pd morale is up overall but some ppl are dooming and crying about basic obvious issues that are getting worked on. it's just a patience issue imo
[1:15:26] Flackzee: jk
