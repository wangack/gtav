[8:47:07] Zombiesweat: like which exec?
[8:47:16] Zombiesweat: probably Ray or Mickey
[8:47:22] frozonhawk: position wise?
[8:47:22] SaltySnacks20: I'd think Ray or Mickey
[8:47:55] ChillR2: Swan is CEO material anyway. They better watch out EZ
[8:47:56] Weapun_X: he seems the most reasonable
[8:47:57] Zombiesweat: definitely leaning harder towards Mickey, but if it's a specialty thing like security, that'd probably be closer to Ray
[8:48:01] Weapun_X: exaclty
[8:48:38] frozonhawk: mickey might be the most low-key
[8:48:38] Zombiesweat: If Swan is more information then probably Mickey I think yea
[8:48:49] clownpuncher_: if Swan gives Ray info he'll go shoot someone, lol
[8:49:31] ChillR2: the stories of knowing stuff about him would fit well too KEKW

[8:51:02] frozonhawk: i can see swan giving information, so it would seem like shes not part of it, but she is
[8:51:06] SaltySnacks20: I could see the interns ending up a bit like the goons did in 3.0 where they ended up as kinda like their own group
[8:51:30] this_is_not_me: crystHuh ffzCursed Ninja Swan
[8:52:03] frozonhawk: that is how information gathering works
[8:53:15] frozonhawk: the fight thing might bring in enough info to feed to them, so best to focus on what you want to do
[8:53:32] SaltySnacks20: Swan doesn't have all of her eggs in the intern basket NODDERS

[12:37:34] lollygagger808: that’s what you call plot armor
[12:37:35] terranausorous: Lmao
[12:37:49] bubbaduva: I ain't hear no bell!
[12:37:52] Zombiesweat: Swan was taking it easy, she’d obviously win if she took the Rock Lee weights off crystNoU
[12:38:38] frozonhawk: you really wanted to do a dodge crystLUL
[12:38:39] Zombiesweat: 3x MMA Champion giving her student a win to boost his confidence classic
[12:39:16] bubbaduva: Perfect moment for the glasses!
[12:39:17] RipperX_GK: Swan mustin't show all of her true strength
[12:40:01] ChillR2: EZ
[12:40:11] RipperX_GK: I think someone did not want to win exactly but make it look good
[12:40:11] frozonhawk: BLUBBERS
[12:40:15] ChillR2: he's so (kinda) cool EZ
[12:40:41] ExtraLarios: Free for all pogg

[12:41:55] ChillR2: free for all would be good in one hour, so the tsunami wash tem away
[12:42:06] RipperX_GK: can Swan get cards she can give out? like promting the smash club?
[12:43:11] ChillR2: KEKW
[12:43:13] ExtraLarios: KEKW

[12:44:52] JetpackDuck: I am scared
[12:45:04] Zombiesweat: When you said cards I thought you meant a fight card Ripper
[12:45:17] Zombiesweat: Like a list of matches for an upcoming event
[12:46:08] RipperX_GK: yea it was a thought
[12:46:36] RipperX_GK: i guess its just done via yellow pages now?
[12:46:40] Purzeval014: brekkers needs shades now
[12:46:55] Zombiesweat: I mean she could make some image to put on Twatter probably
[12:47:23] RipperX_GK: i was thinking more like RP inducing stuff
[12:47:24] Zombiesweat: Some template and you can replace names
[12:47:46] RipperX_GK: giving out caards well you interect
[12:47:54] this_is_not_me: crystHuh They're just lucky Swan held back. https://streamable.com/bdpnx7
[12:47:55] Zombiesweat: If there’s a way to do physical ones that’d be cool too
[12:48:47] RipperX_GK: yea a stylized card i was thinking about
[12:48:59] Weejeebird: Jammies
[12:49:41] ChillR2: birjj
[12:49:44] RipperX_GK: i am not familiar all that well with 4.0 mechanics and stuff yet
[12:50:40] ChillR2: KEKW 󠀀
[12:50:56] RipperX_GK: like gang vs cops?
[12:51:05] frozonhawk: another design could be, if the S is to hard to read, the swan could be on the line like it's swimming with smash club underneath
[12:51:41] SaltySnacks20: group events really only work with groups imo. Like one gang vs another. If its just a bunch of individuals, then a more normal bracket tournament is better imo
[12:55:59] ChillR2: her list has people from all timezones KEKW
[13:01:16] frozonhawk: a form would be good could list time zones and if they have beef
[13:02:02] frozonhawk: crystPray
