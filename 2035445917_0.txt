[3:30:48] hereforff9: من نمیخواهم بگویم، اما به عنوان چیز جالبی احساس میکنم که از دیدگاه کسی شروع شده که سعی دارد موارد را توضیح دهد و معنی کارهایی که انجام میدهند را بفهمد. حتی با اینکه بیشترین چیزی که هر حرف انفرادی انجام داده است، در تنهایی درک او مثل پلیسهای کراودر است که هرگز پیدا نمیشود. من نمیخواهم بگویم و این جالب است چون وقتی به سمت دیگر میچرخید چیزی را برای توضیح دادن پیدا میکنیم که هر چه گویاتر باشد، هر چه آن را پیدا کردم.
[3:30:48] MegaBro5000: I graduated in December with a bachelor's degree in sports management. I know English, French and Spanish. Some of my skill sets include video editing, public speaking, communication, working well with others, and working under pressure. I played football, I was a part of the Esports club for 3 years, and I currently have a internship for the Esports team. In my free time, I like to make YouTube videos and I like to watch sports and work out.
[3:30:48] Koll0: En aio sanoa, mutta minusta on mielenkiintoista ajatella, että se alkoi siitä näkökulmasta, että joku yritti selittää asioita ja ymmärtää tekemisiään. Jopa eniten, mitä kunkin hahmon teki eristyksissä hänen ymmärtäväinen väkijoukko kuin poliisit löytää koskaan. En aio kertoa, ja on hassua, kun käännät ympäriinsä mitä selität sen sanovan mitä tahansa, kun huomaan sen.
[3:30:49] agnarz: Δεν θα πω στον Esfand τι να κάνει, αλλά θα πω ότι είναι επώδυνο να βλέπω τον αστυνομικό rp να είναι τόσο μαλακός, προσωπικά. Ακόμα κι αν οι μπάτσοι όπως ο Cornwood καταλαβαίνουν τους περιορισμούς του, οπότε κάνει το μέγιστο με ό,τι μπορεί και κάνει τα πράγματα διασκεδαστικά για τους θεατές. Αλλά το ότι το cop rp είναι μαλακό δεν είναι ευχάριστο για μένα προσωπικά και νομίζω ότι μειώνει τη συνολική ατμόσφαιρα της πόλης.

Ook al begrijpen agenten zoals Cornwood zijn beperkingen, dus doet hij zijn best en maakt hij de dingen interessant voor het publiek. Maar persoonlijk hou ik niet van de softheid van het rollenspel van de politie, en ik denk dat het afbreuk doet aan de algehele sfeer van de stad !

[3:32:01] Speeddevilx: Taco Bell's Crunchwrap Supreme is a six-sided wrap made with a flour tortilla, seasoned beef, nacho cheese sauce, lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream, and a crunchy tostada shell. The tortilla is folded into a hexagonal shape and grilled until golden brown. It's served with chips and a drink. Taco Bell also offers a breakfast Crunchwrap, which is made with a soft tortilla, sausage or bacon, eggs, hash brown, and cheese.

His communication is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the words will go over a typical im gay viewer's head. There's also Wee Wee's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from im gay Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance.

[3:40:11] poisonousbagels: To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Wee Wee. His communication is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the words will go over a typical im gay viewer's head. There's also Wee Wee's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from im gay Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance.

[3:43:38] Speeddevilx: Corn on the cob is a culinary term for a fully grown ear of corn, also known as maize, that is still in its natural husk. It is a popular summer dish in many parts of the world. Corn on the cob has rows of juicy, sweet kernels on a central core or "cob". When fresh, the kernels burst with a sweet, milky juice and have a tender, slightly chewy texture. They are meant to be eaten the long way, but most people don't eat them properly.

[3:43:54] tehshoe: The missile knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn't, by subtracting where it is, from where it isn't, or where it isn't, from where it is, whichever is greater, it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance sub-system uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is, to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is.

[6:13:13] imSteffin: "I'm not going to tell Esfand what to do, but I will say that it is painful to see the police officer be so soft, personally. Even if cops like Cornwood understand his limitations, he does the best he can and makes things entertaining for the viewers. But the fact that the policeman is soft is not pleasant to me personally and I think he detracts from the overall atmosphere of the city."
