[20:42:53] chaosgeek1: wow didn't realise locals crach into each other without players being involved
[20:43:15] Rahjoth: @miss_daydreamer The gravity of a black hole is so strong that there is a distance at which nothing can pass back out of it. Normally, your speed could determine that, but even light is not fast enough to escape this volume of a black hole. It's called the black hole's event horizon; the place after which nothing can be observed ( because the light can't get back to you to you so can see it ). That's why it's a black hole.
[20:44:00] Rahjoth: Woah, way longer thant I though, sorry Chot. crystCry
