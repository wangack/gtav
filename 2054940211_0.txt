[4:21:28] eborcurean: @sarahmarbies no she said she might take it off
[4:21:33] ThePitfallover: the idea initially was the Guild could potentially swap harddrives so they have the paleto rep?
[4:21:48] Myki_Cameda: think hes refering to handing off the PC with the current strain to Guild, KC taking over the other one

[4:23:13] Myki_Cameda: @CptApples they will both have the app. the only difference is the strain they have been doing is on the 'main' pc. which they were going to give to Guild
[4:23:24] PsychoBKilla: Probably gotta be constantly pushing
[4:23:32] sarahmarbies: @eborcurean YIPPIE
[4:23:32] Sealclaw: And paleto rains too much Madge

[4:23:44] ThePitfallover: considering EVERYONE is below 20% except Cypress means we're fine
[4:23:46] FriskiestSpoon: putting in shifts to push weed
[4:23:48] FreefireHS: maybe 2 strains can work together?
[4:23:53] footmunched: I think Bjorn has been doing Grime with Gloryon to get his money up
[4:24:01] SpectreUK: Can swap the harddrives right?
[4:24:01] mobius__0ne1: need like 6-8 ppl pushing
[4:24:11] Fr0stwav3: tink what if the guild grow the same strain?
[4:24:12] eborcurean: staying connected on weed works for guild+kc alliance
[4:24:12] ThePitfallover: KC and the Guild can continue rebuilding the Paleto rep until we HAVE to split shrujj
[4:24:14] sarahmarbies: @eborcurean do they have beef with the guild now? BLUBBERS
[4:24:30] THEgoodCOW: @FreefireHS you cant, the % will go down the more the other group has

[4:25:26] snowe: BOOBA

[4:26:31] jerabet: @Ritosha He learned about this like 10 minutes ago so who knows what's going through his head.
[4:26:40] triggerpoint007: I mean it makes sense kc and guild are two different groups
[4:26:44] ThePitfallover: @Ritosha they're operating on the idea they need turf rep to get Chimp Clipper Pro dongle, which means they assume progression needs to be separated unless they're going to be a LOT closer than originally intended
[4:26:45] cyphert3xt: what is hire contact is
[4:26:45] snowe: wait that makes managing finances SO EASY for me thank god

[4:27:13] Tronno: Man, they're persistent KEKW
[4:27:13] Myki_Cameda: @eborcurean the plan was Guild getting the GPUs to stock thier racks to earn the coin to outfit the 'spare' pc. when it was ready KC would be giving the PC with the current strain to the guild, and starting up fresh on the other PC in the new turf
[4:27:14] Sahneee: those guys are like those annoying #ad calls
[4:27:15] h0ud1n: KEKW spam
[4:27:22] sarahmarbies: every single time he calls she’s like “who’s this guy?”
[4:27:23] jerabet: @triggerpoint007 Yeah but there are more groups than turfs to push in, so in the end people are either going to have to share them or fight over them.
[4:27:25] Harcini: he litreally has the worst timings

[4:34:21] SpectreUK: But nothoa will want to be included in paleto soonish
[4:34:27] eborcurean: @ViolentAkuma yeah Mary was one of the ones who pushed for it
[4:34:32] illifis: Just hand him the tablet

[4:35:23] xTheBoB: xD
[4:35:50] PsychoBKilla: peepoNuggies
[4:36:15] PsychoBKilla: So many strains in sandy
[4:36:15] footmunched: The strain is 100% of that 12%?
[4:36:18] eborcurean: the turf is 12% and 100% of the weed being pushed is kc+guild weed
[4:36:20] infamous_butcher: did families turf go up to 15 now?
[4:36:26] infamous_butcher: I thought it was 14
[4:36:27] eborcurean: wait other way 100/12
[4:36:33] RoyLeeTV: more volume of weed pushed
[4:36:34] Ritosha: how good the weed is
[4:36:39] jerabet: @eborcurean Yeah that sounds like a good way to explain it.
[4:36:49] Sonaro8: i woulda guessed it being your working at 12% of the capacity of that turf
[4:36:55] BladedBuzzer: its not clear what difference not being the top strain in a turf is
[4:36:56] HotCocoaGamer: It makes sense and is also kinda confusing
[4:37:06] poppins1729: big fish in a small pond at the moment.
[4:37:28] Lordminiw: can you scroll further down on the tablet?
[4:37:29] MisterParry: Dino Nuggies? Sounds like come civ naming
[4:38:05] Trawls421: breaking off into separate strains will just require KCs strain or guilds strain to be built back up. just more needs to be pushed there.
[4:38:15] ThePitfallover: there's no turf in MP though SadgeCry
[4:38:21] Khaza_: not yet anyway
[4:38:28] Lyra_Night: Chat cant they just switch the computers? and transfer the BC?
[4:38:37] Trawls421: So essentially KC could still push up there under yeagers request
[4:38:37] Sacher: there is no drawbacks to splitting and still pushing in paleto
[4:38:51] MJ77seven: oh damn
[4:38:57] Tritonesubstitution: @Lyra_Night probably yes, except the guild doesnt have enough btw to buy all the apps kc have
[4:38:58] Qulnir: maybe new turfs added? Hmm
[4:38:58] CptApples: LS will probably be the same
[4:38:59] jerabet: It's not even that bad to push somewhere else and keep the home base clean.
[4:39:15] Sacher: Little Seoul has apartments which will scuff the locals too
[4:39:24] Sealclaw: Little Seoul is Snr. Buns headaches LuL

[4:53:27] infamous_butcher: does he think the gpu racks are staying?

[4:53:29] SenorTaavi: They are saying the same thing but different KEKW
[4:53:34] Devaleth: I view it as if the guild is now forced to completely go their own way, it's going to take so mcuh time to get on their feet that they'll be so much weaker as an ally
[4:53:36] eborcurean: JJ got burned on people taking advantage but not contributing and he's super defensive abount it
[4:53:40] HotCocoaGamer: I mean JJ is -100 speech and cooked.
[4:53:41] ThePitfallover: KC can get the money when we can sell it to the vagos
[4:53:54] xoSeethe: bills are paid and alliance is reinforced - sounds like a plus
[4:53:57] letschillplease: he poured a lot of energy and sweat into it too, i can understand JJ perspective

[4:56:01] triggerpoint007: I mean kc was a gang from the start
[4:56:02] KaraSnee: I think that jj just wanna have a clean cut between guild and KC
[4:56:05] tedium7: hmjj
[4:56:10] captaincameron: it’s honestly up to Mary to be able to separate this
[4:56:11] darkestnight333: Yaegar thinks that since your part of the guild in the long run that he is your boss, and then KC was under you and him
[4:56:17] Tritonesubstitution: tbf I remember a meeting where mary said kc were all her minions PepeLaugh

[4:56:36] Sahneee: tink
[4:56:40] NitroC3LL: i can see why JJ would like to keep things split from yeagers operations NODDERS
[4:56:49] macrotoad: Hmm it would be less of a problem if all of the Guild make they're own gangs.
[4:56:59] AetherMana: So are they beefing because Viggy is a horde character and JJ is an alliance character?
[4:57:00] TheWhiteWillow94: fuck it just merge
[4:57:04] SirHellsing1995: yiggy be ignoring the guil/KC dynamic

[4:57:09] MJ77seven: willow LUL
[4:57:10] Tritonesubstitution: @Tritonesubstitution the little guild meeting after the big hoa-guild meeting that blew up where they also told yeager to step up and be leader

[4:58:40] Isen_Mage: hey Kylie try this to explain the split
[4:58:41] Isen_Mage: Kaneshiro and the Guild are 2 different raid teams. Mary is the leader of the KC raid team, but also raids with the Guild raid team in her spare time and will occasionally use strats and her geared toons from the KC raids to help the Guild ones
[4:58:50] RoyLeeTV: she's the only member you dont have to worry about LUL
[4:58:56] f4p__l0rd: It confusing having a leader as a member of an other gang
[4:58:56] AetherMana: Can they be a "HORDE" of gangs? :D

[4:59:06] miicrowv: Every situation is going to be different too wether guild gets involved or not

[4:59:15] LuckyGeist: isen LUL
[4:59:15] ADStrike: oop
[4:59:15] FriskiestSpoon: i think Yeager feels that if anything happens to Mary he has to get involved even though KC is there for that
[4:59:17] ZeroNeuro: a way they started?
[4:59:18] eborcurean: they didn't start the war!
[4:59:20] eqnjn: Yaeger having an identity crisis
[4:59:21] Matrix8369: Mary is the time share for both groups. KC in the morning and Guild in the eavning
[4:59:23] Tronno: He made it sound like Mary in his gang, so KC is under him
[4:59:24] doccthunder: gigl
[4:59:27] Calgoesmooo: the war started because he got held up
[4:59:27] Marshall2: I mean a war vinny started
[4:59:31] ZeroNeuro: The war was started cause Fury saved Yaeger from being kidnapped xD
[4:59:31] Lorddarkwolf: ur allies

[5:01:17] Boltaction_Babe: I mean it didn't ruin this anything in this last conflict?
[5:01:19] illifis: Just a case by case basis
[5:01:23] KewlKittyProductions: it's a when asked to help

[5:01:27] Ritosha: if you need him you can call him

[5:01:30] RoyLeeTV: he was needed yesterday thoug
[5:01:31] Clodhoppr: just give him a hug KEKW
[5:01:32] candorus: I mean, it also depends on the degree of what happens and IF they want to get involved too

[5:01:37] jerabet: @Wardiel_ Not wrong NODDERS
[5:01:38] kessy1893: yiggy mary grew up and can handle herself now thanks big bro
[5:01:38] RoyLeeTV: mary was about to air everything out

[5:01:43] mobius__0ne1: kyliebLove yiggy
[5:01:46] zenatr: JJ is afraid Guild is gonna get KC's stuff because Yeager is Mary's gang boss, I think that's it
[5:01:47] arcticOP: @boltaction_babe well the color was during the NA raid time and not AU/EU raid time :)
[5:01:48] jayced123: Guild protects Mary during NA, KC protects Mary AU/EU
[5:01:51] Fr0stwav3: he wants to just make sure he's there to protecc
[5:01:53] Spelliepanda: Daddy yiggy is now sad he wont be able to take care of his lil devil
[5:01:55] tellingliesaboutjosephk: hug it out folks
[5:02:03] eqnjn: Yaeger took a lot of shit from   CG so I get his frustration
[5:02:05] shpuddie: deal with KC nodd
[5:02:10] ThePitfallover: Mary should've been more involved in the ending of the War tbh
[5:02:12] kingcloudii: tell them wrong tree LUL
[5:02:15] Entropystachio: asking good questions mhm
[5:02:18] heartasnack: that would be very spicy
[5:02:19] ThePitfallover: that would've helped Yeager understand the dynamic
[5:02:24] greatmuta2: LOOK AT IT LIKE THIS NA is GUILD Mary, AU is KC Mary. CG were after the guild and mary
[5:02:32] triggerpoint007: That's right deal with kc  mary the leader
[5:02:35] arcticOP: @thepitfallover probably
[5:02:40] eborcurean: also the full information share is huge for the guild
[5:02:58] d00b3rr: yeager should just join KC to balance it out lmao
[5:03:07] rmcgowan: It's sort of like how the Guild felt when Yeager split off to do his Sanguine stuff is how I see it
[5:03:08] ThePitfallover: KC and Guild = 3.0 CG/Hydra imo
[5:03:14] Lorddarkwolf: does he know flippy and migl were in hydra and CG
[5:03:17] ADStrike: easy way to explain is sayuing that the Guild is Mary racing crew and KC is Mary ganag KEKW
[5:03:26] ViolentAkuma: I said this in Meta Chat before but Mary in the guild and leading her own gang was always be a bit weird for people on the outside. It was for flippy and mgl. Let's say flippy fights for cg, Hydra would get attacked too cause people wouldn't separate it. Same thing when vendetta people helped in some Hydra wars, people attacked vendetta.
[5:03:38] rmcgowan: He wanted them to not get involved with his Sanguine stuff, but they still cared and wanted to
[5:03:50] Clodhoppr: pay guild butcoin in short term to offset for the needs
[5:03:52] eborcurean: @ViolentAkuma people have friends, it is not weird
[5:03:52] rmcgowan: Trying to find a way to navigate stuff like that can be difficult
[5:04:00] Trawls421: thats why Mary was soldier hunting during NA hours
[5:04:11] fraij: I mean fuck it, could just have it so if you start a war with either Guild or KC, other gets involved. NATO allies or like CG/Hydra umbrella type deal

[5:59:42] Sonaro8: its a good test to see if it even matters this early
[5:59:47] ThePitfallover: it's better for Guild/KC strains to fight each other and battle other strains out
[6:00:08] jerabet: @ThePitfallover Than to work under one strain?
[6:00:10] illifis: I assume eventually there will be a donzen in each turf
[6:00:13] prozorftw: yehhhh
[6:00:18] TriplSkipp: same time?
[6:00:22] footmunched: Timezones though?
[6:00:22] CptApples: different timezones
[6:00:24] ThePitfallover: @jerabet this is assuming they just want to split for simplicities sake
[6:00:25] TheZYgnar: they are different timezones tho
[6:00:27] kingcloudii: paleto is actually really small, the more pushers the worse itll be
[6:00:30] Sonaro8: its gonna be hot as fuck anywhere on the map where pushing is happening
[6:00:30] TheZYgnar: Guild is NA and KC is AU
[6:00:30] Dankomanda: it would be some great copium if MP turns into a zone
[6:00:31] PsychoBKilla: The thing is KC push on a different timezone
[6:00:33] SpectreUK: I think KC should just use little seoul
[6:00:35] rmcgowan: Opposite time zones, really shouldn't be an issue
[6:00:36] MJ77seven: kc would probably be pushing in au/eu have to consider that

[6:00:58] ELTanqu3: KC will push in AU/EU and Guild push in NA
[6:00:58] Meh17_: KC timezone should be fine tbh
[6:01:01] lagunavex: worse it cost 10k to move out of little seoul
[6:01:12] miicrowv: I mean if not KC its gonna be someone else shrujj
[6:01:13] fraij: Little Seoul might be terrible cause of the apartments and senior buns

[6:02:28] ibruticus: tink
[6:02:29] ZeroNeuro: sandy has 4
[6:02:32] ThePitfallover: @SpectreUK the hotspots are around Snr Buns though, a lot of foot traffic and people who will fuck with pushing
[6:02:34] TheZYgnar: that way Guild pushes NA tsunami and KC AU tsunami
[6:02:46] eqnjn: I've never seen a strain drop from 100%, maybe it locks in at 100?
[6:02:50] Myki_Cameda: @fraij is there a problem about oleto or snr buns? only issue would be the ammount of PD traffic through the area. there are a shitone of locals.

[6:03:47] ThePitfallover: KC wouldn't want anything to do with Paleto if it weren't for Yeager yea
[6:03:47] tigerland06: KC is in Paleto with Yaeger's permission.
[6:03:56] stylzo_: yeah its yeagers and notHOA turf not KCs
[6:03:58] TheRealBatesu: So what will be the solution with the houses?
[6:03:58] Bulbabengt: also who knows, maybe down the line there will be more areas that open up
[6:04:01] FIunkifer: without yeager KC couldnt push here because of the notHOA
[6:04:01] jerabet: @Myki_Cameda Yeah I guess mainly the cop presence is much higher in the city, especially around snr. buns.
[6:04:03] footmunched: Guild would ask if they wanted to push in MP

[6:12:30] MJ77seven: YEP
[6:12:31] kessy1893: its crazy how the damage impacts the performance of a car
[6:12:31] PsychoBKilla: NA is the hardest timezone to recruit in

[6:12:33] rmcgowan: NA is one of those near impossible time zones to build a group in
[6:12:34] SARcasm19: the people that can wake up NA have gangs already

[6:12:54] CptApples: and anyone with prio is already in a group
[6:12:57] miicrowv: there are a lot more established characters in NA too
[6:12:59] ben0809: yuh it hard in NA
[6:13:04] Fr0stwav3: hard to do when NA is full of good prio peeps, and those peeps already have their bubbles/groups they vibe with
[6:13:10] SpectreUK: au/eu good foundation and stretch into NA over time
[6:13:11] Vatinius: people who have prio for NA are usually established in a way where there's not many who are gonna join new groups
[6:13:12] ViolentAkuma: And most people in NA already have their groups so it's harder to get people for it.
[6:13:14] candorus: it works out better au/eu because you also have time for Brock in NA HAPPERS
[6:13:14] macrotoad: IDK why but I feel like Winters would make a great NA recruiter idk
[6:13:21] ThePitfallover: I don't think there's ever been a single gang that had 24/7 presence
[6:13:24] lucho724_: you are forced to build NA based on prio
[6:13:27] ThePitfallover: MAYBE some like GSF
[6:13:40] fraij: For the longest time Hydra didn't have anyone in NA up until very late 3.0

[6:14:18] Fr0stwav3: KEKW it took Hydra the entirety of 3.0 basically to eventually have an NA squad, and even then that was spotty
[6:14:24] mugcostanza: kyliebList
[6:14:28] shpuddie: nodd
[6:14:40] lucho724_: It wasn't even an NA squad, it was mostly the queue wasn't a factor towards the end
