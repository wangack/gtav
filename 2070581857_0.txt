[1:30:33] phinnaeu5: This is very true
[1:30:39] KrisCat: marty needed a longer vetting time before being bought in sadly
[1:30:40] dootadoo: OMG Luce was there the whole time KEKW
[1:30:52] TropicalToucan: Sounds like Lang has already signed Martin off everything lowkey
[1:31:18] OmegamonX: martin was lang's hard vouch so if lang wants him gone thats is pretty bad for martin
[1:31:55] YellsAtLife: if these problems aren’t messing up the cash flow, is there really a problem??

[1:32:04] lunorx6: no one call larry tho
[1:32:06] martymagoo78: side crew would’ve been fine if one of them wasn’t JP
[1:32:22] phinnaeu5: @martymagoo78 true
[1:32:27] its_ajc: @martymagoo78 yeah side crew made sense with the amount of ppl the group had but JP was always gonna bring chaos
[1:32:32] dootadoo: JP was involved, nuf said
[1:32:32] thumphah: maybe Harry needs a conversation with Martin
[1:32:45] phinnaeu5: @thumphah I think so
[1:32:48] mogambo_khushhua: lang told them not to
[1:32:54] JessCee7: The guy who was the the sewer doesn’t understand anything i wonder why LUL
[1:33:10] TropicalToucan: This is why we need Arush
[1:33:26] jayruff65: I agree with everything Harry said only thing I don’t think lang would want their USB’s stored in your house
[1:33:38] dootadoo: Bought in and liking someone are two different things
[1:34:10] jayruff65: but Marty was crazy giving jp keys to his house
[1:35:03] phinnaeu5: Yuno took a lot of shit as well
[1:35:07] TropicalToucan: Lang is always going to deal with that though. Lowkey the city doesnt see your group as 5 leaders just Langs group
[1:35:09] phinnaeu5: Not to the extent of Lang though
[1:35:18] phinnaeu5: @TropicalToucan very true
[1:35:27] TropicalToucan: Lang is always going to get the phonecalls
[1:35:43] KrisCat: @TropicalToucan it doesn't help that lang constantly has meetings and makes deals/decisions w/ ppl and doesn't fill in the crew w/ details
[1:36:29] KrisCat: same problem yeager had in 3.0.
[1:36:43] dootadoo: TRUE
[1:36:51] jayruff65: good point
[1:37:04] FlackAttack94: NODDERS
[1:37:07] martymagoo78: it’s like Harry shooting Lang, if he did that he’d be fucked up and make bad decisions
[1:37:12] limpingmonke: Well said Harry
[1:37:53] Mike___sep: sounds like a fine Is in. order
[1:38:01] dootadoo: @martymagoo78 I heard that before. Marty shooting JP is like Lang shooting Tony.
[1:38:05] mike9904_: LUL
[1:38:05] TropicalToucan: Prayge Save Larry
[1:38:06] jayruff65: Harry making great points
[1:39:07] AntzRede: harrNODDERS
[1:39:46] last1_2go: probation
[1:40:07] dootadoo: Nobody has to deal with JP unless they like getting f'd in the ass.
[1:40:19] TropicalToucan: True. Every person in the crew also has to be their own person
[1:40:42] KrisCat: Marty told the crew not to drag him into their beef with JP, then dragged the crew into his beef w/ JP. I get why Lang's pissed LUL
[1:40:44] iRedix9: iRedix9 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 3 month streak! Siuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
[1:41:04] TropicalToucan: Does he even need a key? Doesnt he only need a key maybe to the north house if he grows weed.
[1:41:15] OmegamonX: surprised that key wasnt taken yet tbh
[1:41:30] broxx1: @KrisCat facts
[1:41:50] dootadoo: MARTY does not give Harry a key to his house.
[1:42:03] its_ajc: chat, did they end up giving Ilya a key and everything ?
[1:42:06] techy_krypton: They should have a meeting with Marty and see how he feels about ever working with X again and let him know the crews concerns if not these meetings are pointless
[1:42:10] TropicalToucan: @its_ajc not yet
[1:42:16] emiz0r: YESSSS
[1:42:20] its_ajc: the timing KEKW
[1:42:38] techy_krypton: Ilya's a G
[1:42:54] TropicalToucan: I think there should be a rack house and maybe Marty could "earn" those keys
[1:42:55] dootadoo: Marty keyed out.
[1:43:03] Ragnogh: could just rekey the house and start over
[1:43:03] lvlagg: lang was the one that wanted marty to keep the stuff at his house though
[1:43:09] its_ajc: YEP

[1:43:53] dootadoo: CarlSmile
[1:44:06] JessCee7: With what money geegaB
[1:44:06] thumphah: a big issue is your crew have no allegiances with other crews. Yall are like a lone crew
[1:44:07] OmegamonX: @KrisCat true but decorating a new one fully again will be a nightmare
[1:44:08] TropicalToucan: So would the next house be the Don house or like a computer rack house?
[1:44:16] bonzo2cj: leveling up chat! 4.0 has been awesome so far
[1:44:17] lvlagg: its the same situation where all the eggs are in one basket, need another clean crew
[1:44:44] KrisCat: @OmegamonX buddha seems to enjoy it. might take a while to finish it tho lol
[1:45:02] OmegamonX: @KrisCat new house won't be scuff haven Prayge

[1:49:59] joshbankai: @martymagoo78 Yeah before he got his new PC, I dunno how he drove around the city
[1:50:14] asimba007: I wish players got wet and then would get cold and lose health so then you would have to use umbrellas or rain coats

[3:36:01] its_ajc: Hollywood ran out of ideas so need to revive franchises again KEKW
[3:36:03] bananawonka: hope they don't fuck it up.
[3:36:07] dumpster_diner: @aumilly when it first opened?
[3:36:07] exo__23: Jammies
[3:36:10] ForgetMidnight: i dont think that movie is old enough for a remake yet but what do I know
[3:36:10] joshbankai: Zechss is going to be Snape
[3:36:10] mCerti: Emma Watson will always be Hermione ReallyMad
[3:36:19] Conf1gs: @Zechss_ you got a good voice for Dudley Kappa
[3:36:20] Aumilly: What is the Harry Potter TV series about? “This new Max Original series will dive deep into each of the iconic books that fans have continued to enjoy for all of these years,” said Casey Bloys, Chairman and CEO, HBO & Max Content about the project, which he also assured fans would be “a faithful adaptation.”
[3:36:27] difficultsleep3r: Why are people surprised by that? 4 years go by and it's remake time.

[3:37:11] joshbankai: @Zechss_ Hagrid isn't that old Kappa
[3:37:16] martymagoo78: did Clem ever show you that spot she mentioned?
[3:37:19] cinekeith: just to be clear, its not a remake of the movies
[3:37:21] OriginalGibsta: amazon making a fallout series, but amazon track record is horrible
[3:37:27] cinekeith: its supposed to be a more faithful adaptation of the books
[3:37:28] NugThug: the movies do cut out alot from the books
[3:37:36] Zechss_: @joshbankai wtf
[3:37:53] joshbankai: I'm jk we are about the same age, I think, I'm probably older tbh

[3:48:52] me_kNight_: Every year a new game movie or series comes out and most of the time it's forgotten about after the initial backlash Monster Hunter, Mortal Kombat etc.. and now Halo it's all gone to shit
[3:49:21] mortaldictata117: I refuse to watch the halo adaptation
[3:49:55] me_kNight_: Same dude
[3:49:57] mortaldictata117: the cgi is hot garbage and they butchered the source material
[3:49:57] rachelnicole420: megaaHappyVibe megaaHappyVibe megaaHappyVibe megaaHappyVibe
[3:50:03] joshbankai: @mortaldictata117 that looked like a disaster almost as bad as Marvel's Inhumans
[3:50:07] rachelnicole420: megaaChipiChapa megaaChipiChapa megaaChipiChapa megaaChipiChapa
[3:51:31] joshbankai: Each season of the Witcher after 1 StonksDown
[3:52:06] me_kNight_: @joshbankai Inhumans was bad but at least it didn't turn into a comedy/action like 80% of marvel movies now
[3:52:17] mortaldictata117: the witcher is my guilty pleasure, even though the writing absolute ass
[3:52:23] mortaldictata117: *is
[3:52:55] joshbankai: classic
[3:53:13] asimba007: classic
[3:53:14] OriginalGibsta: I watched 5 minutes of the new marvel show with kingping back, and turned it off. Horrible no hope for daredevil reboot IMO
[3:54:10] me_kNight_: Didn't watch any of it yet but Madam web was half decent

[3:56:06] me_kNight_: Honestly no it's a nice change from the other marvel movies but feels like a preparation for a reboot no post credit scenes
[3:57:34] asimba007: harrNODDERS harrNODDERS harrNODDERS
[3:58:18] BaldScooter: is this the last of the first round of testing?
[3:59:15] OmegamonX: is the strat after getting 130 to just pump production as much as possible to then deliver in bulk because they stack?
[3:59:46] OmegamonX: until you get the itch for the illusory 140 PEPW
[4:00:23] OmegamonX: maybe the 130 leads to the next bottleneck in rep and that unlocks 140
[4:00:46] GaiGenX: Or maybe you can start using better ingredients?
[4:01:05] me_kNight_: Would it make sense to switch from weed to full on moonshine production after you reach a certain point?
[4:01:16] brewner: @Harry do you still open pokemon packs?
[4:01:34] brewner: sad those were fun strems
[4:01:40] martymagoo78: do you know how much dirty you’ve raised so far this week?
[4:01:42] OmegamonX: @me_kNight_ he already delegated weed production to other people if thats what you mean
[4:02:49] mCerti: So tomorrow is it like the days you come in discord and say "I will definitely be around later" KEKW
[4:03:02] emiz0r: harrPray
[4:03:03] me_kNight_: my bad I meant as in for the whole group if moonshine starts making more money to mass produce it with people grinding sewers and others cooking
[4:03:21] Aumilly: @brewner those were some fun streams. the GAMBA would pop off!
[4:03:35] brewner: @Aumilly no cap!
[4:03:39] blazin_4: Life happens
[4:04:10] mCerti: Just a joke though LUL everyone here has life too, we know life doesn't always happen to plan
[4:04:24] blazin_4: And now it's getting nicer out
[4:04:29] Aumilly: does it hurt your statistics if you don’t stream long?
[4:04:35] idea_guy: Your stream grinding was worrying me lol.. you were streaming so much
[4:04:37] asimba007: @mcerti lmaoo
[4:04:44] Aumilly: wait til you have a kid brother
[4:04:45] me_kNight_: It's good that you prioritise your family
[4:04:54] joshbankai: Just do casual 30 hour streams and take a day off Shruge
[4:04:58] bird24287: especially when Ed Sheren can’t come right over in his heli I bet
[4:05:11] brewner: @bird24287 kek
[4:05:26] emiz0r: lol
[4:05:36] bird24287: KEKW those were the good ole days

[4:05:48] TheReaLAbouOuooo: harrGold Yo
[4:05:49] TheRejectsAzFTwitch: Honestly I'd rather watch you for 6 hours and you be happy with the family than stream 15-16 hour days and miss the good moments with the family.
[4:06:01] OriginalGibsta: Harrys cooked off the moonshine
[4:06:14] Aumilly: harrWave @therealabououooo

[4:07:31] TheReaLAbouOuooo: harrGold @Harry
[4:07:32] mCerti: All about balance, it is easy to burn out if you get into unsustainable habits like the 15 hour streams
[4:07:44] idea_guy: You gotta avoid burnout too if your a 1-game streamer
[4:08:09] Hogie48: Us EST people stay up till that time watching you :p

[5:55:18] idea_guy: ACL is super common injury in dogs :( My family dogs have all had to have them surgically repaired. Big dogs have it worse
[5:55:23] TheNilknarf: @mobes7 thank goodness we do.
[5:55:27] youthedog4: yeah that shit is painful
[5:55:47] KrisCat: yeah, it's shitty for a human. imagine it's shitty for a dog too, poor guy.
[5:55:57] youthedog4: not running around as much, compensating for it
[5:56:00] youthedog4: like holding it up
[5:56:01] TheNilknarf: @idea_guy he’s a 100lb  American bull dog mix
[5:56:15] idea_guy: @TheNilknarf how old? a big boy
[5:56:19] Laffing_Man: Yep just like I did when I blew out my knee 🙃
[5:56:20] TheNilknarf: yeah he just wouldn’t stand on it at all.
[5:56:58] idea_guy: It can happen from just normal running too.. the dogs don't even need to step wrong
[5:57:11] TheNilknarf: it sucks but he’s a strong healthy boy. he’s only 3 so hopefully it’s not too hard on him.
[5:57:22] idea_guy: @TheNilknarf jesus, that is young
[5:57:35] TheNilknarf: Thanks for all the kind words chat.
[5:58:10] TheNilknarf: @idea_guy that’s what is so puzzling but the vet said it can really happen so easily.

[5:59:08] idea_guy: @TheNilknarf My wife's aunt has 2 Rottweilers that around the same age and both dogs have had one acl go out.. It's very puzzling. Makes me wonder about the breeders
[5:59:47] idea_guy: The rottweilers are from the same breeder, but 2 different litters
[5:59:48] Poison_ttv_: honkhonkhonkhonk wat was that song lol

[6:00:47] idea_guy: @TheNilknarf It totally is. Mutts have such better health.. for the most part
[6:01:20] Thatgooey: I dunno how people watch TikTok, that shit is too much
[6:01:49] toeknifer: no rat mask?
[6:01:52] TheNilknarf: They do so much inbreeding, at least the bad ones do, and it just extenuates their bad genes amplifying their health problems. it’s pretty well known issue.
[6:02:45] TheNilknarf: Adopting rescue dogs or a dog from the pound is the way to go.
[6:03:00] Asaayu: Isn't that how pugs ended up with such bad face structure?

[6:03:56] TheNilknarf: So many good boys and good girls are bought from breeders then then when the peopl realize it’s more work rhe. they expect they get dumped at the pound.
[6:04:10] Sword_Scream: Yeah, I think I'm just going crazy
[6:04:22] idea_guy: @TheNilknarf I love my two rescues.. my best buds
