[2:19:06] jd2881: Cornwood got Jason to let him try to pit his G6 truck with the truck and suv. Neither could fully turn it. You'd need 2 vehicles.
[2:19:32] wildarrow88: All you can really do is try to spike them
[2:20:02] donsson: Shoot em

[2:20:31] xMistressMayhem: Yeah them trucks are tough to stop
[2:20:32] Panos_97: Don't reveal that to Cornwood under any circumstance
[2:20:44] Xierany: PD shoot start to shoot earlier cause right now crims are getting away too easy
[2:20:55] Thraxton1: One way to fix it is to make them huge gas guzzlers so they can't just keep running for a really long time
[2:21:06] Panos_97: Wait, can you shoot tires in such a case?
[2:21:17] Panos_97: I know you generally aren't unless you're going for lethal
[2:21:23] Panos_97: *aren't allowed
[2:21:27] spookyghost21: yeah but then you get 20 hours of court RP because they sue for shooting them Kappa
[2:21:33] Axcennts: Lots of officer hesitate to even tase after crims resist arrest, just need to be a bit more decisive
[2:22:03] Panos_97: Yeah cops are kinda spooked tbh
[2:22:31] skinnylegend000: Buddha learned the hard way in 3.0 bullet proof cars aren’t really bulletproof in GTA.
[2:22:42] Xierany: In general PD is just slow to escalate, which makes sense but also makes it really easy for crims to get away
[2:23:01] xMistressMayhem: Yeah you defo need to think before pulling the trigger you could potentially end a life
[2:23:51] Dee__1__: Exactly

[3:40:46] Vahyl__: it's a decent joke, lil touchy but still funny, what a coincidence
[3:40:54] Xierany: Only reasoning that makes sense here is to DAP Den to force RP
[3:40:54] laaazylemon: but the pd paying money has nothing to do with daps, thats fucked up, im sorry
[3:40:55] HavocusRex: that's his final dap isn't it?

[3:41:11] Diaz10gtg: @HavocusRex yea
[3:41:16] themanwithanrx7: I don't understand why it's a dap, if he did things about the book

[3:41:22] slymox: his first 4 fall off on the 27th
[3:41:26] neft39157: W Mcnulty
[3:41:27] MajorPainCA: Isn't the use of the Taurus as primary at that time and pitting an average car not against policy?
[3:41:28] Lilliphus: if anything just give him a quick talking to but not his final dap
[3:41:30] Luthercorpz: Judges gonna be like you fired Johnson for this and protect Den from this .. LUL
[3:41:33] FlameReetardantPanda: hoppers keep on hopping

[3:41:34] dylanconlon6: he also did his duty to stop pursuing and stay with Johnson

[3:41:53] VSDuck: Noooo you can't know the out come of a pit
[3:41:56] skinnylegend000: it’s a teaching and retraining moment not a discipline moment. if Mcnulty would make the same choice.. it’s dept wide retraining.
[3:41:58] xGameShock: This happens in real. Things cops do is considered fine until someone records it and there is a issue made then the department punish the officer to cover there own ass.
[3:41:59] VSDuck: that car could have gone anywhere
[3:42:05] Panos_97: Yeah I've seen lots of unwarranted DAPs, if this one gets served it'd be the worst
[3:42:07] wildarrow88: Sad day for Den
[3:42:07] judge_hat: denzel should have checked for civilians before attempting pit?
[3:42:07] Xierany: Absolutely Den should not get DAPed for this, Slacks is way off
[3:42:09] Wheez_3D: Is this not just gonna make officers not want to pit
[3:42:17] Thraxton1: people only call it a reckless pit because it's one of the hundreds of times they happen and someone is actually there, those kinds of pits happen literally EVERY chase

[3:46:13] tuhbone: @LittleTexas_SheriffZesty but someone is always at fault in an accident happening
[3:46:19] Kevin_D_Gate: The problem with the line of logic that Slacks is going down, pd will start to think where is it actually safe to pit, and that will cause most to second guess their decisions.
[3:46:31] Lilliphus: i explicitly remember a cop shooting a hostage in the face while breaching a bbmc bank once KEKW
[3:46:41] Thraxton1: Man Slacks just are not seeing what the repercussions are going to be for the PD if they give Denz last DAP on this PIT, so many officers are just gonna stop taking primary because they don't wanna make the pit
[3:46:42] audy: slacks cares too much about optics
[3:46:47] BlindBandit507: Damn this shit sucks tbh LUL
[3:46:54] Vahyl__: was the driver even caught???
[3:46:58] Edward_Theodore: he cant catch a break
[3:46:59] Clivent: Pred was right about Bass LUL
[3:47:01] mikewhocheesehairyyyy12: o7
[3:47:04] STLHawks: honestly, the luck of chat and all viewers is over 9000. We got lucky that this occurred. PopCorn custyDance
[3:47:07] RARA_cht: @audy As a captain he sort of has to
[3:47:08] Nsan7: PITing with a DAP looming over ur head will impede police work I feel like but idk
[3:47:08] JohnieP: I'm with McNulty. I think you run the risk of officer fearing to do their job if you get DAPd for essentially doing their job.
[3:47:10] Vahyl__: LUL LUL LUL LUL
[3:47:11] notthatlizardguy: Den just can't win
[3:47:15] ktothec99: Dean's reaction was funny af too
[3:47:18] eri_frost: you cant write this script better
[3:47:20] audy: @audy look at ruth...
[3:47:22] Vahyl__: o7 ohh no
[3:47:23] Deviii_: dude cant catch a break Sadge
[3:47:23] Verion: i feel so bad for him
[3:47:26] Switchblade142: skinny neck ass lmao
[3:47:33] lazydog905: unbelievable
[3:47:34] Vahyl__: not again
[3:47:36] Crazith: I agree with McNulty in this 100%
[3:47:37] Thraxton1: The stars could literally not have aligned in a worse manner for Denzel KEKW
[3:47:39] Lilliphus: it's like someone else said though- handing out a DAP for this just makes people want to cover shit up
[3:47:40] jdotno: I think pitting is the real problem, it doesn't seem like it really helps end the chases that much, but just causes damage to cars and people.
[3:47:45] BlindBandit507: Bro WutFace
[3:47:52] Wallsh_: The timeline is against denzel
[3:47:54] Panos_97: Exactly
[3:47:56] jd2881: Slacks doesn't even have the right chase
[3:47:56] Edward_Theodore: no your doing whats right
[3:48:00] Xierany: Shiesty has been super careful since getting back from 9 Daps, if he gets Daped from this gonna make the whole PD hesitate in critical situations
[3:48:02] Luthercorpz: o7
[3:48:03] sBuon: PAUSERS
[3:48:05] dapyman: He didn't break any sop rules
[3:48:06] lazydog905: did his job correctly
[3:48:09] Killsauce: it just sets a weird precedent with pitting in the city at all
[3:48:11] Smoogol: o7
[3:48:23] cal5903: cal5903 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months, currently on a 4 month streak! 
[3:49:00] sBuon: Bees are you here? modCheck
[3:49:09] sBuon: did you get dapped?
[3:49:12] BlindBandit507: Yea den should not get DAPed for this
[3:49:13] themanwithanrx7: lmao yeah and that pit sounds 10x worse
[3:49:18] plawpsruby: We saw it from maples eyes
[3:49:19] STLHawks: Spoon, they're not
[3:49:23] sBuon: no meta clips chat
[3:49:25] AndresSaysHey: Didn't you  you ask for dap points tho?
[3:49:29] jdotno: you also open bananas from the bottom, so I can't agree with you on anything
[3:49:36] skinnylegend000: Mcnulty asked for a dap for that situation and didn’t get any
[3:49:41] Vahyl__: justice should be served
[3:49:42] sBuon: @STLHawks how did you know Saususge
[3:49:44] jdotno: lol
[3:49:46] bigmaan08: LMFAO
[3:49:48] bobdole5678: thats the right way to open a banana
[3:49:55] sBuon: !meta
[3:49:55] Nightbot: Metagaming is giving Custard information that his character does not know. Metagaming is strictly prohibited in this chat. Any offenders will be timed out, and repeat offenders may be banned
[3:49:58] Thraxton1: yeah so many pits end up with crazy "unsafe" shit and noone gets in trouble, I mean Slacks does it himself
[3:49:58] sBuon: AAAA
[3:49:58] Nightbot: AAAA
[3:50:00] Edward_Theodore: you should be captain your the perfect balance
[3:50:02] Vahyl__: LUL LUL
[3:50:03] wombo2hiitcombo: from the bottom?
[3:50:03] STLHawks: @sBuon i tried to use the @..... It didn't work
[3:50:04] sBuon: super diplomatic
[3:50:05] Lilliphus: @jdotno if you open them from the bottom you don't get any of the stringy bits
[3:50:08] 4lphaBeta: Seriously the worst luck LUL
[3:50:09] sBuon: love it
[3:50:14] dapyman: Denzel did everything correctly
[3:50:22] jdotno: whats wrong with the stringy bits?
[3:50:24] Radcrazykid2: @jdotno Your supposed to open from the bottom
[3:50:28] sBuon: @STLHawks he added an emote though... Saususge
[3:50:36] BlindBandit507: This the most unfortunate series of events I've ever seen
[3:50:39] khrow: I hope they dont dap for the sake of dap'ing
[3:50:45] Switchblade142: god i feel so bad for shiesty
[3:50:46] Vahyl__: Denz was reckless, poor Johnson LUL
[3:50:46] Smoogol: out of the 3 people the car surgically hit johnson KEKW
[3:50:47] STLHawks: Spoony I dunno what to tell you. FeelsSadHug
[3:50:49] sBuon: man is doing is best to get advantage on his charisma roll
[3:50:58] Radcrazykid2: The bottom is how monkeys open them
[3:51:01] YoshiTheDeeno: whats a dap?
[3:51:03] Xarisher: Pitting at 80mph isnt reckless?
[3:51:04] sBuon: @STLHawks Saususge you have his car don't you?
[3:51:07] Xarisher: Genuine question
[3:51:30] sBuon: 80mph pit is within SOPs Shruge
[3:51:31] Vahyl__: with civs around? kinda reckless
[3:51:32] ktothec99: 80 in 4.0 isn't crazy at all
[3:51:34] STLHawks: @sBuon no....not yet
[3:51:36] scarydisk: if he gets dap no more pursuit
[3:51:37] Verion: That vehicle they were chasing would almost never go under 80
[3:51:41] jdotno: sops are 100+ is no pit, so 80 is fine
[3:51:41] Panos_97: Fuck someone should write down these points Custy has made
[3:51:42] Xierany: @Xarisher You can't catchup to a car before it reaches 80
[3:51:44] Thraxton1: yeah it was one the more tame pits if anything, just crazy bad luck
[3:51:45] Silence5405: sniffthenewchatter
[3:51:46] sBuon: @STLHawks D:
[3:51:53] Panos_97: That shit should be used in court unironically
[3:51:56] Luthercorpz: wrong answer LUL
[3:51:59] STLHawks: @sBuon I Really have a suspicion on what they got though. It's that Acura/honda Red. I'm SURE of it
[3:52:05] sBuon: wait SOPs are the pirate code?
[3:52:25] BlindBandit507: Yo ho yo ho it's a pirates life for me
[3:52:27] dapyman: Denzel is saying all the right things
[3:52:30] Vahyl__: and then someone ended up in the ICU NotLikeThis
[3:52:44] sBuon: @STLHawks I mean the car will 100% be red that man has a thing for red cars
[3:52:46] Luthercorpz: sgtaMunch  greenishSpicy    sgtaMunch    greenishSpicy    sgtaMunch    greenishSpicy
[3:52:47] Crazith: Denzel staying with Johnson after the fact should matter
[3:53:01] jdotno: I would like to see the success rate for pits and ending the chases. It has to be a pretty low percentage. I'm not sure they are worth it.
[3:53:05] plawpsruby: He also called ems
[3:53:07] themanwithanrx7: Den don't -100 this
[3:53:07] Verion: I think he did everything right, just very unlucky
[3:53:09] STLHawks: @sBuon I wanted that red vette he had. I liked that car.
[3:53:12] spookyghost21: what kind of question was that by slacks regarding what he should do if he got sued ?
[3:53:15] zentsk: man slacks is power tripping den zel right know
[3:53:19] heftylefty_prime: Slacks is terrible lol "So you don't know to PIT" was his response to that is crazy.
[3:53:22] Xarisher: Timing
[3:53:28] Xarisher: Timing is a great answerrrr
[3:53:29] sBuon: @STLHawks that's the one that he blew up right?
[3:53:32] Edward_Theodore: get better cars first maybe
[3:53:42] knowlightnofear: Feels like he's bating him to bury himself
[3:53:51] sBuon: D:
[3:53:52] sBuon: AAAA
[3:53:52] Nightbot: AAAA
[3:53:54] knowlightnofear: (i knwo he's just trying to build the RP, but still)
[3:53:55] sBuon: what a question
[3:53:56] themanwithanrx7: that's a gotcha question
[3:53:58] Crazith: He did as an officer is what I would want
[3:54:03] 4lphaBeta: What are these questions
[3:54:03] STLHawks: @sBuon Yeah, I think he nuked the head gaskets or bent a rod.
[3:54:06] spookyghost21: he expect him to say "I like how it felt"
[3:54:10] isomonk: "do you feel bad" bro that's pro
[3:54:20] sBuon: @STLHawks yeah he thinks he's good with cars
[3:54:25] cal5903: yeee mcnulty gets it
[3:54:28] Killsauce: mcnulty invited to the bbq Gladge
[3:54:39] VSDuck: AAAA
[3:54:45] themanwithanrx7: Kian is one of the boys
[3:54:55] STLHawks: @sBuon Fun is Fun. I am happy for 'em
[3:54:56] Lalgil: 100% he is
[3:54:58] Lalgil: lol
[3:54:59] wombo2hiitcombo: He's bringing some good ass potato salad
[3:55:02] heftylefty_prime: Noooo
[3:55:03] sBuon: AAAA
[3:55:03] Nightbot: AAAA
[3:55:05] skinnylegend000: highest form of compliment to be invited to someone’s dinner table IMP.
[3:55:09] Verion: There is no person there ever lol
[3:55:25] retooh: i wish they decided to actually go there and talk about it
[3:55:32] riggsy_au: objection, it's an underpass, your honour!
[3:55:37] VSDuck: it doesn't matter if it is an area in the past that has a lot of foot traffic, that car could have gone ANYWHERE
[3:55:54] VSDuck: it's just unlucky that it went and hit someone
[3:55:54] sBuon: Prayge you got this Den
[3:55:54] Luthercorpz: The one chance 3 ppl were there .. raycHmm
[3:55:57] Verion: PauseChamp
[3:56:01] SCPFFFF: help my boy shiesty
[3:56:07] random_viewer_55: It's the safest pit in the entire city KEKW
[3:56:25] Miterex: good risk assessment
[3:56:25] palace93: it means you can’t put anywhere
[3:56:34] Crazith: Johnson was unlucky, but damn the RP that came from this
[3:56:43] sBuon: Hmm
[3:56:50] tr0kgaming: The problem with DAPs for me, like in this situation how does it fix anything
[3:57:00] khrow: yeah dap's are meant to correct an action, theres nothing to correct here, it was just unlucky
[3:57:00] ComradeGreetingCard: what did he do wrong though?
[3:57:03] VSDuck: custyHUH
[3:57:05] laaazylemon: that is insane
[3:57:07] Jay_P8890: damn
[3:57:07] isomonk: ?
[3:57:14] jdotno: there is no way a vote is going to be unbiased
[3:57:18] hiicks_: That's ridiculous
[3:57:19] Astavexa: @tr0kgaming Makes it worse. For first times should always be a verbal warning, DAPs should be last resort
[3:57:19] JediJacob_: custyHUH
[3:57:19] wombo2hiitcombo: thats a good question
[3:57:21] zentsk: that's insane
[3:57:23] baekmu: dunno why this is becoming a disciplinary review to begin with. let the courts decide KEKW
[3:57:23] Switchblade142: I think if they have to put it up to a vote its not nearly conclusive enough to be a dap
[3:57:24] Cultivated: I guess never pit in the city ?
[3:57:24] Thraxton1: every pit in the city is next to a sidewalk, there could be a random guy on any sidewalk that gets hit, it's actually outragous if you dap over this, it's gonna set the precedent that you can never pit in the city
[3:57:26] BlindBandit507: Hmm
[3:57:27] Lilliphus: he did follow SOPs though...i feel like that's not in question
[3:57:30] bigmaan08: did they dap him? my kids interupted
[3:57:32] bigmaan08: lol
[3:57:33] themanwithanrx7: for whaaaat
[3:57:40] heftylefty_prime: This is insane
[3:57:41] wombo2hiitcombo: @bigmaan08 still discussing
[3:57:43] STLHawks: I mean, None of the three saw the situation. So....Let the leadership team cook
[3:57:44] Xierany: Is he looking to make it fit now? Shouldn't be the other way around?
[3:57:47] diurnambull86: what did he do wrong except having bad luck?
[3:57:48] sBuon: Clap
[3:58:00] Luthercorpz: It'll be days to get 3 captains around
[3:58:03] ALFE_: 'Civilian presence in mind' KEKW Guess no more PBS ever
[3:58:03] bobdole5678: AAAA
[3:58:03] Nightbot: AAAA
[3:58:04] jb11166: if he gets dapped thats unreal
[3:58:06] Vahyl__: should be DAPed imo and I like Denz
[3:58:07] tr0kgaming: If you have to debate, then surely a disciplinary procedure is 100% not warranted
[3:58:10] lovelee___: uhsClap uhsClap
[3:58:12] palace93: so unlucky people was there
[3:58:17] JasonVoorhees71: pepeSmoke
[3:58:19] Panos_97: McNulty for fucking President
[3:58:27] bigmaan08: @wombo2hiitcombo thanks
[3:58:30] Luthercorpz: Anyone else would get a Dap. That's the bottomline
[3:58:31] Icesevage: Based as the kids would say
[3:58:38] BlindBandit507: This can't end well either way
[3:58:42] VSDuck: @Icesevage AAAA
[3:58:53] STLHawks: This is called officer discretion as well.
[3:58:57] Vahyl__: yet Johnson was fired.. LUL
[3:59:09] Switchblade142: I mean it just sets the precedent that criminals can make shit as reckless as possible and blame it on the PD imo
[3:59:16] jas3370: alright so no pits in the city got it
[3:59:16] bobdole5678: wasn't johnson fired for lying though
[3:59:19] Verion: yep ruby
[3:59:20] sBuon: good point Ruby
[3:59:21] heftylefty_prime: It should just say never PIT again in the SOPs then.
[3:59:23] Lilliphus: ok but consider- los santos has free housing so there's no homeless people, checkmate
[3:59:26] bigmaan08: why is slacks(the character) sd intent on this?
[3:59:28] Verion: exactky
[3:59:29] mavericks312: it’s not a tough decision
[3:59:31] bigcat52: johnson being fired is still crazy
[3:59:32] jdotno: this shouldn't be a cause for punishment, but for refinement in the sops
[3:59:32] SCPFFFF: qualified immunity
[3:59:33] Leritt: slacks is  on some shit lately idk
[3:59:34] VSDuck: if he gets a DAP for this EVERY pit from now on would be under review
[3:59:35] Vahyl__: @bobdole5678 what he lie about?
[3:59:40] Lalgil: no pits
[3:59:50] straysinger_music: locals are civilians too lol
[3:59:50] wombo2hiitcombo: NODDERS
[3:59:55] zekonja17: this is poor leadership from slacks side. putting a vote for smth that he can decide on himself
[3:59:56] jb11166: if denzel gets fired for this then pd is cooked icl
[3:59:56] Rascal_PM: daps not pits
[3:59:58] psychosnef: all crims will get away in the city in the future no more pits Kappa
[4:00:00] 0Douglas: If denzel gets DAP pitting only out of the city, so people just drive in city OMEGALUL
[4:00:01] Lilliphus: wait los santos does have free housing right? LUL
[4:00:01] Clivent: Pred was right about Bass LUL  󠀀
[4:00:02] STLHawks: @sBuon you building anything new btw?
[4:00:04] Switchblade142: Yeah you won't have a PD if you dap everyone for stuff like that tbh
[4:00:10] sBuon: @STLHawks HUHH
[4:00:11] Vahyl__: just makes the PD look bad...
[4:00:17] JasonVoorhees71: PAUSERS
[4:00:17] ComradeGreetingCard: would he get a dap if there is no one there?
[4:00:20] jb11166: penny shot up 3 civs and got 1 dap, not hating on her but come on how are they equivelant
[4:00:29] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: dap PD
[4:00:29] Vahyl__: @Switchblade142 someone was sent to the ICU tho hmm
[4:00:34] keemotherapi: @Leritt bro fr this is why people were afraid to do anything and this'll put them right back into that mindset
[4:00:35] newby_lt: The risk of others being hurt is why pits need to be approved.  In this case the risk of the fleeing driver was greater than injury to bistanders
[4:00:37] sBuon: @jb11166 incomparable
[4:00:40] Xierany: If you can't pit cause civs are potentionally standing on the sidewalk, you can never pit anywhere
[4:00:41] AndresSaysHey: This reminds me of the Dundee terrorism trial where it was like you gotta imagine that there's actually a million people everywhere before you do this and it just opens up Pandora's box
[4:00:41] slymox: Aziz sat in a G6 truck and got 4 DAPs
[4:00:41] Wallsh_: wow
[4:00:47] Luthercorpz: true
[4:00:48] Wallsh_: no one pitting anymore KEKW
[4:00:52] jdotno: @jb11166 penny is not a full officer either though
[4:00:59] Switchblade142: @Vahyl__ Yeah, shit happens sometimes. Doesn't mean anyone's at fault.
[4:01:01] Leritt: @Leritt YEP
[4:01:02] Diaz10gtg: @slymox he didnt get 4 daps for that lol
[4:01:04] MsHolliee: oh noo
[4:01:04] heftylefty_prime: It looks bad...DAP
[4:01:06] zeike_nz: so no more pits then
[4:01:10] ComradeGreetingCard: accident
[4:01:12] johnnycolision: that's just going to lead to people never pitting in the city
[4:01:13] khrow: thats wild
[4:01:13] JasonVoorhees71: PepoG
[4:01:14] Rascal_PM: might as well get rid of guns while you’re at it with that logic
[4:01:14] wafiy637: ??????????????????
[4:01:15] Lilliphus: why not wait until after the court case to decide on a DAP then, because doing it before makes the PD look guilty already
[4:01:17] Vahyl__: @Switchblade142 true true
[4:01:17] Cultivated: Ya never pit again
[4:01:18] jb11166: @sBuon but theres just no consistency with anything that theyre doing thats what im trying to get across
[4:01:23] Caeros: punishment for an accident they didn’t have control of
[4:01:23] wafiy637: hell no
[4:01:24] STLHawks: Why would someone else be punished?
[4:01:24] zentsk: convince?
[4:01:26] JasonVoorhees71: convince?
[4:01:26] Clivent: ......
[4:01:26] Thraxton1: so the risk is you get Dapped wtf is that kinda logic HUH
[4:01:28] Edward_Theodore: so what slacks is saying let every fking criminal get away gg for the PD
[4:01:28] VSDuck: then why is slacks pushing for a dap if he's saying "it is what it is" ??
[4:01:28] tobs74: how to hold this off before shiestys other daps fall off NotLikeThis
[4:01:31] skinnylegend000: DAPs arent public knowledge so blaming optics makes no sense.
[4:01:32] spookyghost21: Slacks is on that ZAA ZAA
[4:01:33] King0fKhaos: fucking daptains
[4:01:34] Vahyl__: I just want to see what happens if he gets DAPed LUL
[4:01:35] 4lphaBeta: This is so silly
[4:01:38] laaazylemon: that is borderline petty, im sorry
[4:01:41] wafiy637: slacks soft mannnn ...
[4:01:42] Disgrim: Sadge
[4:01:43] Thraxton1: that argument makes literally no sense
[4:01:45] Crazith: !vote NO DAP
[4:01:45] iRawrTwice: Sadge
[4:01:45] judge_hat: rip denzel?
[4:01:46] Luthercorpz: He gone
[4:01:46] 0Douglas: Ok this will only make cops afraid to PIT because of a DAP OMEGALUL
[4:01:46] daenerhis: Sadge den
[4:01:47] blockfis: Homeless camp is not populated area KEKW
[4:01:48] jb11166: see what cpt ruth says, denzels done bruh
[4:01:48] Diaz10gtg: o7 ruth clearly wont dap him
[4:01:49] sBuon: @jb11166 those are 2 completely different incidents though is what I'm saying
[4:01:50] jas3370: every criminal is getting away then
[4:01:50] khrow: o7 He was a good officer
[4:01:51] Vahyl__: @King0fKhaos LUL
[4:01:51] mavericks312: if they dap den over this there gonna lose a lot of faith in the PD
[4:01:52] themanwithanrx7: 10 is suspension pending review right? so he could keep his job ?
[4:01:52] HavocusRex: I'd just stop chasing entirely at this point lol
[4:01:53] lovelee___: saabDap2
[4:01:56] wafiy637: vote no DAP
[4:01:56] Miterex: I'm.. baffled
[4:01:56] Diaz10gtg: is over o7
[4:01:56] heftylefty_prime: This PD leadership is unbelievable.

[4:04:41] Luthercorpz: True Johnson and 2 other ppls fault for standing at a place ppl are none stop LUL
[4:04:43] Thraxton1: Slacks just does not understand does he
[4:04:47] heftylefty_prime: @Pandrax86 That's not a good thing. Ssaab always revolts back when that happens unfortunately
[4:04:49] Verion: @jb11166 i think his perspective is, something bad happens = dap, makes zero sense
[4:04:50] JasonVoorhees71: pepeSmoke
[4:04:58] TheBFG_01: should Slacks be told about the LSMC stuff?
[4:05:01] mizkifsrecedinghairline: I can't imagine wanting to work as a cop under this leadership.  Never have their officer's backs.
[4:05:04] Crazith: all I see is Johnson was in the wrong place at the wrong time, sucks but Denzel did what he had to
[4:05:17] revengeitself: No one will pit if he does dap Den
[4:05:18] jdotno: Reminds me of anytime cornwood gets punched accidently, he always says "thats my fault, I shouldnt have been standing there".
[4:05:24] Thraxton1: If you only get daps if something bad actually happens you are literally just dapping for bad luck
[4:05:34] firefighters52299: Officer complaint for shift 1?
[4:05:36] BabyL3mur: hello friends (:
[4:05:39] 0Douglas: Why do you have to DAP to punish someone? Can do other things...
[4:05:43] Vahyl__: unlucky Johnson LUL W denz for sticking with him at the ICU
[4:05:48] Luthercorpz: Johnson loses again LUL
[4:05:49] Murrig: he was within the SOPs. if there's a problem, it's with the SOPs, not the officer who followed them
[4:05:51] glumpyblacksheep: Discipline should be action oriented, not results oriented
[4:05:58] sBuon: did you need to talk to slacks about vehicles or something?
[4:05:59] Pandrax86: @heftylefty_prime hah yeah, I know from experience in game and in his chat.😂 but yeah, this could of happened to any officer, Denzel just happens to be the perfect storm and with his 9 daps… it’s bad. it’s a SOP/training issue for sure.
[4:06:03] Leritt: Leo is overcooking DAPS wise but sadly probably Denzel will end up being DAP'ed
[4:06:04] xtrainhobo: It seems like you guys always defend your captains in public but they never defend you guys in public.
[4:06:04] sBuon: idk if you said you did I'm just checkin
[4:06:07] DougEFreshGaming: did he shave his head?
[4:06:12] BabyL3mur: she sounds kiwi
[4:06:21] mizkifsrecedinghairline: Might be time for the officers to unionize.
[4:06:21] coldskarr: if i was crim running away soon as cop car touched me i would just throw my car into ppl on the sidewalk, cuz hey why not get cops in trouble too
[4:06:26] chuppachopstbh: i know it all needs to be rp'd out, but shift 1 had like 3 people on Den being one of them, and it will be shitty until shift 2 logs on.
[4:06:28] Lilliphus: @Luthercorpz he might stilil win in court, this is just about whether or not denzel gets fired tbh
[4:06:29] wizwonder: @BabyL3mur she is kiwi
[4:06:34] BabyL3mur: cool
[4:06:35] PhantmK: "Following that line, I would like everyone to be dapped for every time they have accidently injured someone doing the job." = Forced Resignation of the Entire Force.
[4:06:37] Abdullah_8499: hi all how’s everyone
[4:06:43] FLCK3R: just give him time off,dap is a bit much for that kind of stuff,he didn't fuck up "alone" sure he pit the car but he can't control it
[4:06:44] jb11166: icl i see crims getting away most of the time already, gonna be even worse now
[4:06:46] Nightbot: Come join the discord and fill up the ranks! https://discord.gg/PMrxK3F
[4:06:47] sirnaoyuki: Denzel has the worst luck ever
[4:06:53] hiicks_: Bones gets made to shave his head for breaking SoPs by having guns out in the meeting room but Den gets put up to a vote for following SoPs
[4:06:58] wafiy637: why always denzel ? haha
[4:06:59] judge_hat: i feel like the pd needs a union and if theres a policy they dont like they can threaten to strike
[4:07:02] MrHyde81: essaying
[4:07:04] Luthercorpz: @Lilliphus Oh yah he'll win the case, ramee will be all over the judges the DOJ gonna lose it. The RP out of this will be crazy good
[4:07:11] driver1036: Didn't they implement a class for getting rid of 1 dap point
[4:07:12] sBuon: "if you have more than 5 DAPs for your own safety you are not allowed on the pursuit team" Kappa
[4:07:12] scootypebbles92: every job always has one person the bosses has to pick on
[4:07:13] VectorFalcon: DAPS should be internal punishments for breaking SOPs.  If you need a punishment that is visible to the public, for when things go wrong when following SOPs, have something else.  Community service, bike cop, walk the beat, stand guard, etc...
[4:07:17] xtrainhobo: W response about wanting RP over Wins
[4:07:17] jb11166: nah i dont care about that im just saying like u dont want cops scared to pit
[4:07:19] quaylewastaken: Dap dap dap dddaaappp every body dapppp ddaaaap dap
[4:07:21] Abdullah_8499: I believe the dap is destroying the pd, specifically with the captains giving them freely
[4:07:25] Pandrax86: crims have all the tools to use. it’s like yall say all the time. the PD is a step behind on mechanics
[4:07:29] Radcrazykid2: If he gets DAP then everyone on his side should go on strike
[4:07:34] JediJacob_: paycheck time?
[4:07:35] Switchblade142: Yeah to me if there's this much debate about the SOP, situation, etc you can't give a dap.
[4:07:46] jb11166: i dont want ws for cops ur the only cop i watch lmao, just saying u dont want officers scared to pit
[4:07:52] Luthercorpz: This whole thing will start a PD vs DOJ war probably LUL RP galore
[4:07:53] Clivent: LUL
[4:07:54] mavericks312: captain slacks slowly turning into daptain slacks lol
[4:07:55] Vahyl__: 9 DAPs he should be doing office work, and school zone crossing
[4:07:59] Phindrius: Archer Susge
[4:08:01] mizkifsrecedinghairline: Den'zel getting dapped for this will destroy moral.
[4:08:04] TheDaghda: even the mayor and crane had no clue about daps like days ago, it's not a public thing
[4:08:06] Verion: lmao Archer

[4:08:17] Wallsh_: WideSusge Archer

[4:08:31] alexshaw: #Justice for Johnson <3
[4:08:32] chmod_R_777: Ssaab is a really good RPer, the character Leo Slacks is a "by the book" kind of guy to the extreme, impressive...
[4:08:32] ShebasOphir: Archer WideSusge
[4:08:34] Pandrax86: @luthercorpz chases will be so boring if police feel they can’t even do conduct the chase. it’s bad RP for the crims too. they enjoy the chases.
[4:08:36] JasonVoorhees71: classic
