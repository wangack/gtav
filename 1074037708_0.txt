[8:42:36] sutanhazz: HOA garage is a good addition NODDERS
[8:42:36] TossedOnion: You have a storage in the tavern now too via garage TPFufun
[8:42:40] RezaQ8: Tavern is def better

[8:42:45] Valaphar: 2k storage backroom and front for non illegal shit
[8:42:48] 3p1cMexican: 5k a week or buy like 4 vans and free parking lmao it would be wayyy cheaper than marlos storage
[8:42:51] hypesuke: if you can work out the lot that would be way better
[8:42:55] sonic01tv: How many times has the HOA done something dumb enough to result in a raid?
[8:42:58] captain_froppy: I think it’s only worth it if you’re about to be raided/investigated
[8:43:01] cassdoodles: keeping it within the group would pay off money wise
[8:43:01] Drax_1X: it creates some space separation to another location if the police are watching... It has use, but is it worth
[8:43:03] Qwuilp: Tavern lot looks good imo
[8:43:09] ripefart: Tavern for short time maybe idk about LONG run probably stirage
[8:43:12] ripefart: Storage
[8:43:13] Figueronie: plus with marlos stuff you dont go into it so you're a sitting duck
[8:43:14] KaridonKaar: Using the tavern seems pretty risky
[8:43:21] DisillusionaI: Managing all the things in the trucks could get annoying though I imagine lol
[8:43:25] PrinceFromDunlop: As long as everyone but Stanley can get keys Kappa
