[1:01:21] Luthercorpz: I mean I watch a lot of streams an no ones house has this  issue
[1:01:25] skeggi_: the house itself is a black hole like someone said earlier
[1:01:26] paystevecash5: it’s the courthouse and Mosley s
[1:01:26] brute_forsen: i bet the house got fucked when devs set it up and it somehow has lik 100 interiors

[1:01:26] Khalzard: gotta be something used in house, can just delete things one by one until it stops?
[1:01:37] ADoggNJ: @Federalp Pretty sure Arrowhead can't get back into anyway
[1:01:43] ItsAHazardLife: if I had to take a guess it's something with the sewers or something

[1:01:47] skeggi_: @Khalzard they cant get close to the house
[1:01:47] engmamede: Maybe other houses doesnt have Ellie's bun?
[1:01:49] ItsTrevor: If they cant get it fixed the only option might be to get a different house maybe
[1:01:57] El_Diablo83: move the house to a different llocation
[1:02:01] ExessiveGK: other houses have plenty of Props sticking out and their house is fine your must be a collision with another object thing too
[1:02:02] Luthercorpz: @Khalzard  Nah man it's nothing to do with items in house. It's 100% a location issue or something
[1:02:05] us_ace: this house was built with love and malding
[1:02:06] BikeLife423: @khalzard it was still happening with absolutely nothing in the house lol
[1:02:08] Takima80: need no clip to go under the map and see what other meshes are over lapping
[1:02:08] elchoncho901: It's gotta be something he did if the area is good and it's just your house
[1:02:11] Nitro3k: is there away the devs can roolback the house to when it was good ?
[1:02:14] Azzarill: ITS ELLS ASS

[1:02:47] auldae: refund please koil
[1:02:54] WheresWaldo420: there should b some sort of set limit of stuff to put in the hosue to prevent this
[1:02:55] jers_gaming: maybe in the coding
[1:02:59] patch5594: but that’s game development. things break things happen randomly
[1:03:00] randyrandoe: Yah but they are constantly adding stuff which added further possible issues
[1:03:00] brute_forsen: NODDERS if there was limits to props, devs would have made it clear
[1:03:03] patch5594: no game is perfect
[1:03:03] WheresWaldo420: like a max list of stuff
[1:03:04] Luthercorpz: I watch endless streams. NO ONE's house is like this an ppl have crazy shit in their houses
[1:03:04] skeggi_: its something in the location thats making ur head pop
[1:03:06] El_Diablo83: start with a blank slate of the house
[1:03:07] ThreeNPink: @ThreeNPink even if he did build the inside of the house. But did he know what ever he used was going to do that?
[1:03:13] mediocre_pwnage: if it's the # of house items then they should figure out how many is too many and just limit it

[1:03:20] Takima80: its got to be the location of the house and surrounding businesses and its a mesh thing under the map
