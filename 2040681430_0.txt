[1:33:33] adzse: The record for the longest time awake is held by Robert McDonald. He went a massive 453 hours and 40 minutes without sleep. That’s an unfathomable 18 days, 21 hours and 40 minutes. Robert McDonald achieved this record in 1986. The Guinness Book of World Records stopped monitoring this record due to the fundamental dangers correlated with sleep deprivation. That said, no one is known to have broken it since Robert McDonald’s 1986 triumph. dizzTHINK

[2:22:49] adzse: @JDXL The record for the longest time awake is held by Robert McDonald. He went a massive 453 hours and 40 minutes without sleep. That’s an unfathomable 18 days, 21 hours and 40 minutes. Robert McDonald achieved this record in 1986. The Guinness Book of World Records stopped monitoring this record due to the fundamental dangers correlated with sleep deprivation. That said, no one is known to have broken it since Robert McDonald’s 1986 triumph. dizzTHINK

[7:52:29] Palizangetsu: The problem with sani is that it has the biggest effect on the overall economy
[7:52:37] Light1stNight: look no matter what new things are going to need mats and mats will always be needed to maintain the city that is how it worked in 3.0
[7:52:58] kronogotthis: goddamn
