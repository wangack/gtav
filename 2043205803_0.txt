[0:36:16] MillaZenik: my hair is the exact same way
[0:36:19] SebasBP28: o she back
[0:36:20] nightingale3E: trust me - you have to hair train.
[0:36:22] cubdy: dry shampoo!
[0:36:24] Ginoveli: bald acie
[0:36:29] Ginoveli: fk it
[0:36:29] LifeIsJoy_: @FrOzInFeRnO hi hi
[0:36:33] jbt445: dark hair looks greasy so fast
[0:36:34] emzy___: my hair is the same :( its a struggle
[0:36:39] STONASESS: one of teh symptoms of grindiitis is greasy hair
[0:36:39] Ginoveli: acieBald
[0:36:40] krazykiddaniel13: i like the beanie..
[0:36:44] nightingale3E: start with no washing your hair for 2 days...do this for a week.
[0:36:46] leadtooth: when your hair is greasy and you feel ick, dry shampoo isnt going to help LUL
[0:36:52] MillaZenik: @nightingale3E hair training does nothing, it has to do with how much oil ur body produces
[0:36:53] ladybizzy: @emzy___ saaaame
[0:36:57] leadtooth: my hair is the same and it's short
[0:36:58] nightingale3E: Then go to 3 days no washing....do that for a week.
[0:37:02] eureeka82: Mine gets so dry and frizzy I only wash it twice a week
[0:37:26] Ginoveli: my hair is really soft and light now days it feels like it switched texture a couple months ago
[0:37:38] dioholic: damn vee brie looks good
[0:37:44] FrOzInFeRnO: Oh wow. You have made some big progress. You have computer racks as well.
[0:38:05] nightingale3E: @MillaZenik I thought that too, because I had an oily scalp. But hair training teaches your scalp to not produce so much oil. Shampooing strips your scalp of oil - the scalp then produces MORE oil to compensate.
[0:38:07] SebasBP28: I'm ordering soe fried chicke n
[0:38:10] capttoffee: It looks so good

[0:39:21] iHarsh29: @acie craft a staircase
[0:39:47] SebasBP28: @crazyiitopii chocolates before eating say if you're hungry
[0:39:49] crazyiitopii: Looks ALOT better well done brie
[0:39:55] SebasBP28: @crazyiitopii you made a choice?
[0:39:57] MillaZenik: @nightingale3E nothing can teach your body to not produce oil. Other than washing it with products that help control sebum
[0:40:03] Webb903: Can you crouch under them?
[0:40:04] StreamElements: Webb903, no
[0:40:15] Ginoveli: with the bodies on the street like 20 minutes ago im going to assume there is some type of gang problem going on

[0:42:11] nightingale3E: @MillaZenik It does, lol - but ok, we'll have to agree to disagree on this. I have waist length hair, I workout 6 days a week, and I can go 6 days without washing my hair and it's not oily at all. <3
[0:42:19] Webb903: You got this though

[3:05:13] TSM_ImperialHal: isnt GTA RP like a seasonal thing

[3:05:48] Hollowshaun: loveaDRIP <Ariana New BF
[3:05:51] hackinglove: hal it is like a seasonal thing
[3:06:04] RenOfficially: @keet_7 Server reset helps the game not be so glitchy, she doesnt have to wait, but it is in her best interest to not do stuff close to the server reset
[3:06:06] jjtheone98: Y'all remember when Mr.Krabs sold Spongebobs soul? Lmao
[3:06:09] crazyiitopii: @tsm_imperialhal gta is 2nd highest category consistently on twitch behind Just chatting LUL
[3:06:15] TSMDataMiner: https://i.postimg.cc/mr6mWqFJ/IMG-1457.jpg
[3:06:18] Schleten_: GTA RP have a life span.. That's why this is Nopixel 4.0 at one point people can have everything and do everything so they need to reset it
[3:06:21] ShubuYeole: u installed graphic mods ?

[3:07:19] RenOfficially: @keet_7 np np
[3:07:23] xAdxm_: Damn Vee got them workin man arms KEKW
[3:07:24] crazyiitopii: Imagine if Hal didn't stream Apex it wouldn't even be top 20 category on twitch anymore

[3:08:41] almightydolla: @TSM_ImperialHal gotta rob a gun off a cop right now
[3:08:43] TSM_ImperialHal: tempo said it best
[3:08:48] TSM_ImperialHal: who wants to live 2 of the same life

[3:09:16] CRlCK: no 󠀀
[3:09:21] CRlCK: !permit @Xqzmeimtoxic
[3:09:21] StreamElements: @xqzmeimtoxic, you will not get timed out for the next 60 seconds.

[4:48:31] Roro_____: @Moxxie92 true Tess said u can
[4:48:33] nonnahshannon: Looks more like a palindrome
[4:48:36] nuhbinho: @Jetrospect they got a rollbak its all there
[4:48:39] iHarsh29: fill those with ventilation
[4:48:40] RasenRendan: long term goal is get a new house with 3 floor imo
[4:48:41] nikulaz_: it looks good
[4:48:47] ChaseBands_: exactly
[4:48:50] blskaz: Wall of fthe overhang on 2nd flore
[4:48:58] ChaseBands_: just put a smaller platform there
[4:49:00] ToTheSameHeights: wall it
[4:49:02] ChaseBands_: and you can do it
[4:49:03] Moxxie92: Put some spotlight under the overhang and it would look sick
[4:49:05] nikulaz_: oh actually
[4:49:09] Fyzzycs: or wall off the overhangs
[4:49:11] 0livesleft: like a spiral-ish staircase
[4:49:12] nikulaz_: put a staircase in that corner
[4:49:12] Jetrospect: @Jetrospect Oh awesome, ty
[4:49:13] TotDigital: ask Tess

[4:49:19] nikulaz_: thats fine
[4:49:22] nikulaz_: you dont need more room for it
[4:49:25] MaxaMinor: just run the wall the other way
[4:49:26] Bags94: ya i think you should make a wall there and cut the stairs in half. at least you wont clip through it
[4:49:27] Dumi90: maybe u can expand only the smaller houses?
[4:49:27] FreddyDollas: I swore Alex said you could expand
[4:49:27] jeinam: or put like plants there and wall them with glass, as decoration - at the overhang i mean
[4:49:34] iHarsh29: cover the staircase with walls on side
[4:49:36] GRAYURSUSTANA: has anyone in chat seen a streamer actually doing it? if not dont say you can
[4:49:36] mcdevil1988: you are supposed to have 2 floors, its pretty obvious.. to have a third floor will always be scuffed

[4:49:41] Roro_____: Tess also said you can expand
[4:49:42] Alaineman: @j4cka1_ was thinking this too
[4:49:49] nikulaz_: doing that will also open up more room for bedrooms on 2nd floor
[4:49:51] JsLeos: Ya gotta gather some info on houses in game i gues
[4:49:53] soniclink10: Entrance to secret room could be through the walled off overhang
[4:49:53] lRaiTz: I think it was Tess that mentioned it if my memory doesn't fail me
[4:49:55] 1iwill: would it not be good having secret room on behind the stairs?
[4:50:05] itsxNeo: maybe put the stairs straight from top till bottom but with one small floor in between - so you can place a door and stuff?
[4:50:07] Deventerwarrior: YOu need to make the entrance to the basement secret somehow anyway
[4:50:08] kyzed: ray house in the same neiberhood ut i swear it looks 2 time bigger than this one
[4:50:09] iHarsh29: here we go erp agai
[4:50:10] ItsNeeks_: I feel like this house is meant to be two story. would explain the weird wall indentations
[4:50:15] Terrous10: i would ignore the over hang, have walls from edge of overhang straign down to the basement
[4:50:15] Alfogamer_: play the  recording 😂
[4:50:24] jbt445: rays second floor pretty much has nothing but empty rooms
[4:50:26] Roro_____: @kyzed yea they have 3 huge floors
[4:50:27] cnIInn: Move stairs and floor over and put another floor under the overhang where the stairs currently are
[4:50:29] deriven: this looks great though ngl

[5:47:33] JustAboveYou: like 5'10 ?
[5:47:37] 1iwill: how tall is tall?
[5:47:40] ChaseBands_: they could just grind G6 and pay for some of them
[5:47:42] Shivie78: Just dont do it all at once. Just do a 1k a day goal and everything you get is extra. And buy for 6 per as much as you can.
[5:47:44] FRAlex010: just message mr black he will grind it when he is on

[5:48:37] Setback1: jason has 100k he can just buy for 30k and the other u farm
[5:48:42] Trystah: i do think having everyone have good rep at various things would be very useful long-term
[5:48:42] 1iwill: did anyone try asking yuno if he knew anyone selling circuit boards?
[5:48:50] toph_er: I would say 1250 a day, cause you're selling a rack every other day.
[5:48:54] jas3y: hows your sani rep now?
[5:48:57] Brthmark: peanut butter and j samich
[5:49:17] lRaiTz: @uxie____ Probably because 10k is a lot even for a supplier
[5:49:22] toph_er: its 112
[5:49:46] jas3y: is there a way u could farm like 1250 and buy 1250 out of the money from the rack they sell each time?

[5:57:17] crafty279: you also realise these are the smaller GPUs too right? as soon as all racks are full they're going to want to swap them for the new ones at 500 per
[5:57:26] garburst: Is he still trying to join the house?
[5:57:34] SebasBP28: W
[5:57:39] DJ_Jenks: how much would you get if you sold them 8 ?
[5:57:50] justCoopp: pop it
[5:57:58] TheMrWiik: not worth until they update their performance
[5:58:04] crafty279: they're not worth it while you have empty racks, but once they're full they want to swap them out
[5:58:06] Flugger1: pop it now MadgeRightNow
[5:58:06] F34rL1x: they are the same efficiency but u safe space later
[5:58:25] 42arc: it;s worth if you have excess buttcoins
[5:58:26] Slaydess7: double the cost, double the perf
[5:58:30] Alaineman: The blueprints are pricey
[5:58:32] Azyraft: yuno did the math
[5:58:33] Setback1: they are not atm a extra rack + normal gpu just better i think
[5:58:40] 42arc: and money
[5:58:40] lRaiTz: Double with less racks/PCs and MAYBE less electricity and heat for the output
[5:58:46] Slaydess7: it's worth if you lack place or electricity and shit
[5:58:50] justCoopp: @acie, it was 300 you are blind KEKW
[5:58:51] STONASESS: jason needs to invest his 100k if he wants to get this set up, no point leaving it in bank when he could be farming coin
[5:58:52] Nahsta: But I think Jason's point was that building 2 racks with basic GPU's is cheaper than 1 with the fancy ones
[5:58:53] TheMrWiik: prob only worth when you get like 10-20 coins per day
[5:58:58] andrefvm: But you have to spend coins to buy the blueprints
[5:58:59] mishegas: maybe yunos math adds up for him?
[5:59:07] Alaineman: blueprints are way pricier than the basic
[5:59:12] 42arc: civ gang is not there yet, few more days
[5:59:12] Manthster: acieWAVE
[5:59:17] justCoopp: didnt u say 100
[5:59:23] justCoopp: or am i deaf
[5:59:34] Manthster: not much, just home from work. Tired. how are you today brie?
[5:59:34] MaxaMinor: They also cost coin to make I think
[5:59:46] SebasBP28: I'm blind
[5:59:51] jas3y: think it was a cost thing
[5:59:53] Klarisy: yo  hi acie hi chat
[5:59:54] andrefvm: The blueprints are expensive
[5:59:56] Schleten_: Holy shit twitter is so bad I had I'm literally thinking of deleting my account
[5:59:57] STONASESS: it kind of is worth it because then u can sell old gpus too
[6:00:03] DJ_Jenks: why dont you sell the ones you get for 8 and buy them for your dealer for 6 you wouldnt need to farm as many then ?
[6:00:04] uxie____: not worth it yet because its 5 coins per blue print
[6:00:14] justCoopp: yeah i checked vod u said 100
[6:00:17] Slaydess7: blueprint + the fact that they cost twice as much
[6:00:20] Setback1: because they are so much and extra rack + normal cpu are cheaper
[6:00:22] TheMrWiik: not at this time since you only get like a few coins per day
[6:00:23] 42arc: they are worth once you max out rack capacity and nee dmore output
[6:00:25] kr4kk3nn: yeah the new GPU required Buttcoin for the BP and so at the output you were making ButtCoin it was not worth it
[6:00:55] STONASESS: 5 buttocins for 3 crafts of a gpu, means it would cost like 50 butcoing for 3 full racks
[6:01:00] Clodhoppr: heat
[6:01:02] Clodhoppr: yee
[6:01:03] rambocop888: 5 coins for the blueprint to make 3 gpus

[6:02:08] 1iwill: should just slowly upgrade gpus as you coin stock increases
[6:02:16] andrefvm: Then starting to upgrade the gpus
[6:02:22] Slaydess7: @STONASESS 3 full racks that would be worth 6 racks with bad gpu, right ?
[6:02:29] SebasBP28: bullseye
[6:02:30] Setback1: jason is rich as fuck u can easy
[6:02:32] 42arc: imo you should be selling racks now getting $, can upgrade later on
[6:02:52] STONASESS: @Slaydess7 yeah
[6:02:54] Shivie78: There is also talk between Clay and Yuno of the new GPU's will be upgraded so its worth more to make those instead of the old ones you are using now
[6:03:25] STONASESS: jason needs to just buy circuit boards hes costing himself alot of money just letting it sit in bank
[6:03:27] Thunderpint: What you eating!?!
[6:03:37] 42arc: tbf, you should be selling blueprints not racks, to artifically slow down market a bit
[6:03:47] justCoopp: is the truck bugged or something?
[6:03:54] lRaiTz: @STONASESS They can't find a seller
[6:03:56] STONASESS: @42arc thats actually smart

[6:04:31] Slaydess7: oh acieUNGRY
[6:04:35] Shivie78: The problem with that is @42arc people that buy it are still living in the apartments. And they dont have a bench to make the racks. Thats why you sell them as racks.
