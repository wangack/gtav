[3:02:44] f0rbin: they shouldn't have added rolled money, everyone knows it's ONLY obtained tghrough illegal means, but it's unprovable until the admins magically allow it to be 'proved'
[3:02:45] hoanzlgoas: CHAT she is not wrong, if it is not illegal by law then you cant use it in court
[3:02:45] Juhoze: @Deansocool What reason is there to wash the money if it wasnt illegal?
[3:02:46] EGGZOLENTZ: Woweww
[3:02:47] bdg_hyu: she said that was sas to Zel lmao
[3:02:47] ramsin50: damn she even hates poor people

[3:03:10] k13rzz: LOOOOOL
[3:03:10] Beafour: @Deansocool She is arguing that because they game make it obvious whats dirty money, that doesnt mean that it would make sense for RP knowing that its actually dirty since you dont have evidence they obtained the money illegally
[3:03:14] Furo_flo: if that was real money they could pay with it but they cant
[3:03:14] hodgedogg: Tbf she's playing Devils advocate but it seems very hard to charge people

[3:06:31] DA_deFi: you can reasonably obtain some rolled bills without doing anything illegal (finding it in a dumpster), but the higher the amount the less reasonable that becomes, so it should be down to quantity

[3:06:55] debacle_of_our_mullets: Are you going to investigate Ruthless Ruth?

[3:06:59] marneraiders: @wager001 That is based on false statement from Denzel under Oath‚Ä¶ Stated No serial numbers, when those bills have serial numbers on them

[3:08:21] Beafour: @Deansocool Thats fine, but you can get paid in rolled bills if you dont know any better
[3:08:24] Hitcher_TV: @Gachiguru they just need to keep brining these rolled bills and get them found guilty so they can use these cases to make a case law

[3:10:19] Morgaaann: @Deansocool head up brother, your rp is awesome, you'll get that promo
[3:10:21] sticks26: Meta but the only way to prove where the notes are coming from is by opening G6 bags. Something the cops can't really do so it's gonna be difficult to get hard evidence. Aziz's pattern method to prove it is best I think
[3:10:22] k13rzz: @alanmc30 I was really proud of that one icl elisShy

[3:10:50] CazeTV: She didn‚Äôt wanna charge the dude with intent to sell cuz of game mecanics (bags weight being to high) but don‚Äôt see the problem with here viewing rolled money as usual money. It‚Äôs crazy
[3:10:51] ramsin50: the problem is that she is using real life logic for a game mechanic
[3:10:53] Superhank: ruth might just try to cuck denzel at every opportunity as part of her RP

[3:11:15] mannyman122: yooo deano, just wanna say thanks for all the hours you been puttin in recently
[3:11:17] dibadibb: did you guys not question the car chopper guy where he got the rolled money from? seems like that would seal the deal
[3:11:17] Raccoonuary: tbh they need to just rename it to "dirty money" the mechanic is really getting in the way
[3:11:18] sharrkuu: the big problem is cash itself is not illegal and rolled bills can only hint of suspicious activity
[3:11:18] sticks26: I feel you. Your work will pay off in future for sure @deansocool
[3:11:19] EGGZOLENTZ: @deansocool i think the civs ruined a mechanic and your getting in trouble cuz they didnt expect them to snitch
[3:11:25] Panos_97: @CazeTV Bro, exactly
[3:11:25] Beafour: Ruth just want something other than game mechanics to prove that the money was obtained illegally. You can have rolled bills on you without having done anything illegal

[3:11:35] brook_cs2: HUH
[3:11:37] Athasin: LUL
[3:11:37] BDG_Toa676: Ello RJ
[3:11:42] chmbrs: ayo
[3:11:43] alanmc30: @k13rzz that‚Äôs not good enough
[3:11:45] TheGoatstare: I think its just an issue of opinion, need more evidence linking rolled bills to crime until theres so much that theres no doubt about it
[3:11:49] j0k3rhub: they trying to make it slow for crims right, maybe its the same thing with cops , proofs etc
[3:11:51] EGGZOLENTZ: @dibadibb he did and it didnt LUL
[3:11:55] Vestfolding: All these rules are to make Xqc not leave his playground
[3:11:57] Rascal_PM: @beafour yes but they already had criminals admit That‚Äôs how it works
[3:12:00] dibadibb: @EGGZOLENTZ what the FailFish
[3:12:01] Battutah: @nickdrawsstuff they havent fully finished PD generally ill give the devs some time they seem to work on it tbh
[3:12:04] RJ1284: @bdg_toa676 woa deansoSpin
[3:12:06] xxlonegunmanxx: He's to excited Hm.......
[3:12:07] itsGenovah: its a slippery slope because if you say that opening the g6 bags gives that cash... then g6 employees are carrying around "dirty money" and they could be subject to arrest too?
[3:12:10] matthew_2210: developers be like ayooooo y‚Äôall moving too fast
[3:12:12] k13rzz: @alanmc30 we want CHANGE and we want it NOWüó£Ô∏èüíØ
[3:12:15] THE_Palmer1452: Esfand straight up found one of the dudes and he was told OOC to ignore it
[3:12:19] TheGoatstare: didnt even say bye to ruth LUL
[3:12:19] theblackdog808: It can spr
[3:12:22] k13rzz: @rj1284 deansoHeart deansoBDG elisBusiness
[3:12:23] MonkeyFace101: @thegoatstare but thing is, Dean just said they know crims get it robbing G6
[3:12:23] MendokuShea: is the word "dirty" not meant to be the evidence that the money is illegal?
[3:12:23] captain_steve_420: Didnt lock the door...
[3:12:29] Pointehawk: @muller2526 Same always got the "You can if you want to apply yourself" treatment
[3:12:30] theblackdog808: It can spiral out of control quick*
[3:12:30] dragonslayerjef: chat is he reacting to the 20v2 ?!
[3:12:31] nickdrawsstuff: @Battutah exactly, which is why currently playing PD looks like it sucks
[3:12:34] EGGZOLENTZ: @dibadibb yep his ci's told him it all
[3:12:35] tr0kgaming: The PD and its mechanics are supposed to be RP'd out instead of it all being there already, I think thats cool
[3:12:36] IamSalter: so for the rolled cash, wouldnt like snitch statements work?
[3:12:36] Scoo73r: Why is an IFAC a felony? Doctors and EMS have them
[3:12:37] Athasin: So basically the dude was right it was retconned, just not officially.
[3:12:40] xypher85: Kierzz lets swab each other
[3:12:42] joaozinho___: @itsGenovah they sell it for dirty money, the dirty money isnt in the bag

[3:12:45] MUFC246: AYO?????
[3:12:47] Troytd: deansoG
[3:12:48] EGGZOLENTZ: @dibadibb and did it too to prove it LUL
[3:12:50] Beafour: @Rascal_PM Ok, but if you dont know that rolled bills are dirty money, and you get paid 2k for a job thats legal, like taxi work. That doesnt make that illegaly obtained for that taxi driver
[3:12:50] MexiBrent: if they come from G6 why would it be wet with no serial numbers?
[3:12:51] oppositeattractive: start a business reselling PD equipment not labeled PD equipment KEKW
[3:12:51] BDG_Toa676: No hesitation respeck
[3:12:53] nadk2005: HUH
[3:12:56] 0x000b: HUH
[3:12:56] alanmc30: @k13rzz facts deansoSpin
[3:12:57] ramsin50: she is making perfect sense so the devs have to decide if you are allowed to use game mechanics as proof of crime or you need RP proof
[3:12:58] THE_Palmer1452: It let him purchase the keyfab thing
[3:12:59] xypher85: @fitterflash you good?
[3:12:59] Roro_____: the dirty money game mechanics wernt done in a way u can aply IRL logic to it tho, with the washing machine etc. should be the fact that u cant use it to buy anything from locas be enough?
[3:13:03] TheS1lentPuppet: @fitterflash MODS
[3:13:04] THE_Palmer1452: Or try to anyway
[3:13:05] Battutah: @itsGenovah True and you cant make it legal for just g6 workers bcs they arent all the most law abiding citizens omE
[3:13:15] hardcorerunz: DENZEL FOR COMMAND
[3:13:15] steven_even853: @Scoo73r civilians are not allowed to carry them, I believe
[3:13:16] k13rzz: @xypher85 idk what swab is but I‚Äôm down elisHuh
[3:13:20] f0rbin: esfand found the keyfob guy by accident

[3:13:57] MUFC246: WutFace
[3:13:58] sticks26: The question is what do the banks do with the rolled notes. That might assist in proving it's illegal to have those. For the Devs to figure out
[3:13:58] bobbybeee: sausage gurgler
[3:13:59] BDG_ScubaSteve: close ya eyes and say ahhh

[3:14:25] k13rzz: @xypher85 I‚Äôm about to ooc globalüò≠üò≠üò≠
[3:14:28] TheGoatstare: @sticks26 no cop has tried that yet, i feel like that would open the rolled bill cases wide
[3:14:30] Scoo73r: I would just ask why banks don't take the notes
[3:14:31] ajsleeper2: oh shit does aziz only have 1 eye?
[3:14:33] xypher85: @k13rzz LMFAO

[3:15:12] MUFC246: LOL
[3:15:15] PsychoJoker: gachiHYPER
[3:15:22] ramsin50: @tr0kgaming that is a bug i think because the bags are heavier than the brick which makes no sense and that's why she let the guy free
[3:15:27] MUFC246: hope no one outside listening. crazy convo
[3:15:31] sticks26: @thegoatstare yep. Maybe need to approach G6 and ask them
[3:15:33] k13rzz: nah this is the prize for getting bitched by Ruthüò≠
[3:15:38] Gachiguru: @matthew_2210 you have to apply to be a serial killer on the forum
[3:15:44] xypher85: Denzel22 in action

[3:15:50] pingupengwin: Ruth outside ready to suspend den
[3:15:54] tr0kgaming: @tr0kgaming You cant say that 87 bags of weed is possession though
[3:16:02] xxlonegunmanxx: once it's in the Database, it should be on the health screen bottom left
[3:16:06] bdg_hyu: does that mean flashlights work now?
[3:16:15] k13rzz: @xypher85 facts deansoF

[3:16:16] EGGZOLENTZ: @pingupengwin  she was tryna fire him b4 LUL
[3:16:21] xypher85: JOIN THE REDDIT CHAT https://www.reddit.com/r/DeanSoCool/
[3:16:25] sharrkuu: would be different if they had rolling papers and scales as a mechanic
[3:16:27] Athasin: My thing is, she is never as kind to Denzel when explaining stuff like that.
[3:16:30] THE_Palmer1452: Gotcha. Same thing with the one Esfand found
[3:16:33] bosschar95: dapziz
[3:16:35] Gachiguru: esfand found the dirty money cleaner yesterday LULE
[3:16:43] xypher85: Thank fuck chat has slowed down
[3:16:43] TheHoll0w: @BDG_Toa676 it's not real life? NOWAY
[3:16:53] ramsin50: @Athasin that's the fun part
[3:17:00] sticks26: Yeah they're definitely slow rolling the RP and PD capabilities
[3:17:04] armedgolem01: that should make it so when cops are signed in they cant even see the drug dealer npc's
[3:17:06] Koll0: @xypher85 I wonder if that has anything to do with Captain - - not being on screen
[3:17:07] BDG_Toa676: Ffs Hollow üò≠
[3:17:16] OiAM_Paka: w cop
[3:17:17] tr0kgaming: @sticks26 Agree with that, tbh way better than 3.0
[3:17:19] Athasin: WAIT!?! So now when you ask for license and registration. Does that mean they need to hand you the rental papers?
[3:17:28] lillukeii: Duncan Susge
[3:17:31] sharrkuu: you have to build up to it
[3:17:36] xypher85: @Koll0 oh def, she gets under people's skin
[3:17:36] marneraiders: @armedgolem01 that would completely break the immersion
[3:17:43] Superhank: denzel going so hard ruth has to rein him in
[3:17:43] Ryaht: if u got a cop char and a crim char, u can just solve ur own crimes if u dont play the rp right
[3:17:46] THE_Palmer1452: I think that's their thought on the rolls too, unfortunately.
[3:17:48] sticks26: Cornwood found the keyFOB guy. Slacks told him to leave it
[3:17:59] HyperPerky: Hello there @Deansocool and chat did you do youre hair by anychance looks nice
[3:18:04] Trixcross: the story needs to flow well. if someone metas it'd be like 'all of a sudden we know'
[3:18:09] akonv3: samir you are  breaking the CARA!
[3:18:11] Gachiguru: Cornwoods CI told him about the key fob guy
[3:18:15] ramsin50: @Deansocool should they make a tool to check if the money is dirty or not basically like the gsr test
[3:18:17] BDG_Toa676: Ello Perky
[3:18:20] akonv3: car*
[3:18:27] Osiris18_: deansoTea

[3:18:50] k13rzz: @hyperperky deansoHeart deansoBDG
[3:18:51] THE_Palmer1452: I gotcha
[3:18:59] brook_cs2: i think slacks wants more investigation and slow shit down cuz its only been 1 month
[3:19:04] tr0kgaming: @ramsin50 Maybe an investigation to mark / trace money that goes through a crim process that they can document and then get legislation for
[3:19:05] chilly_chang: is Ruth doing it just because she hates you or is it just for the RP
[3:19:08] sharrkuu: I think they're still just slow rolling it
[3:19:25] Athasin: @ramsin50 Maybe devs are working on a serial number search or ink test mechanic and that's why they don't want cops knowing about dirty money yet?
[3:19:25] f0rbin: @Gachiguru cornwood found the keyfob guy 3 weeks ago by accident chasing chatterbox
[3:19:31] BadRabbits: @chilly_chang RP
[3:19:33] ajsleeper2: @sharrkuu i agree
[3:19:35] danrweb: Must be hard for rp cops to be invested though
[3:19:35] brook_cs2: yeah for sure they are
[3:19:39] EGGZOLENTZ: @its_brookcs they shouldve made it harder to do the jobs
[3:19:39] Money2Much: @chilly_chang Pepega what u think
[3:19:45] mynameismikeyd: it would be nice if there was a function in game where if you prove a NPC is like a weed dealer for example, there could be a cop mechanic to "arrest" the NPC and it moves to a new location with a new ped name etc so its like a new connect
[3:19:46] LeoWurf: It really my be slow Idk
[3:19:54] sharrkuu: even with a mayor it's still going to take time
[3:19:55] xypher85: Leo PogU
[3:19:56] morgado_4: can you vote with more than 1 char? if you have more
[3:19:56] THE_Palmer1452: that's the only thing I can figure. Rolls are clearly different than the regular money
[3:19:56] HyperPerky: @k13rzz  üëãüèΩ
[3:19:59] brook_cs2: @EGGZOLENTZ broski you are playing gta you wanna clean floors for 8 hours ?
[3:20:01] ramsin50: @Athasin they money is real not fake so ink test wouldn't make sense
[3:20:01] Juvraj: i sound like a broken record but cant you get statements from bank employees NPCs, that they won't accept it
[3:20:06] BalerionBlackDread: They are 100%, X said people are going way to fast
[3:20:09] bobbybeee: @mynameismikeyd that's a great idea
[3:20:16] chilly_chang: @money2much thanks
[3:20:20] TheGoatstare: @chilly_chang its a RP server bro some of u guys need to use brain. none of this is personal for sure
[3:20:21] armedgolem01: @marneraiders not seeing a npc or seeing a npc that doesnt talk to u both break immersion huhhhhh
[3:20:24] LeoWurf: PogU
[3:20:25] sticks26: Maybe after the election is when they open the floodgates. Seems like that
[3:20:28] akonv3: I got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load I got two phones, one for the bitches and one for the dough
[3:20:29] h4k4n_w4rr: 1 raiders from h4k4n_w4rr have joined! 
[3:20:32] Athasin: @ramsin50 Some of the money is stolen from gruppe 6, which can spray it with ink
[3:20:33] jupiterpuppetteer: nothing incriminating about rolls of money
[3:20:35] ajsleeper2: crims are also time gated

[3:20:42] THE_Palmer1452: True, but y'all got ALOT of CI's, too
[3:20:43] brook_cs2: nah crims moving slow tbh
[3:20:43] freen87: crims should move fast
[3:20:47] BadRabbits: Cops have to be 2 steps behind crims else the crims get shut out
[3:20:49] JazzPimp: crims always go fast cuz w culture
[3:20:49] sharrkuu: the mayor / council is what the cops have to wait for
[3:20:49] matthew_2210: nah crims moving way too fast cops lagging behind
[3:20:52] slatt5: crims are moving fast though look 4heads house yesterday LUL
[3:20:52] hodgedogg: The Crims set the pace so far
[3:20:52] xypher85: Crims are moving slow

[3:20:54] ITZxJeff: yea ive been seening crims doing crazzy things already
[3:20:55] TheGoatstare: yeh kinda, but i tihnk they only have a few crim jobs on the server atm so they dont want u to end all crim activity yet LUL
[3:20:57] mouad_thegoat: Welcome deansoBDG deansoBDG deansoBDG deansoBDG
[3:20:59] tr0kgaming: 4.0 PD has to make their own RP otherwise burnout, I think they trying to make it more creative for PD
[3:21:01] ramsin50: because they don't want to give crims more stuff to do
[3:21:02] Money2Much: u adapt to crims yyes
[3:21:03] Toluen090: Yea others have said crims are outpacing pd
[3:21:09] kb420ps: I actually think that YOU move too fast.
[3:21:09] steven_even853: yeah, but crims are moving too fast
[3:21:09] KellBellnf: Crims are moving insanely fast, the PD just doesn't know
[3:21:10] BalerionBlackDread: Yes, but you are making their life a hell if you find out everything so soon @Deansocool
[3:21:10] jkb_xD: Being a crim isnt a whitelist. anyone can do everything.
[3:21:12] sharrkuu: then there has to be a big case to set the precedents/legislature
[3:21:13] ConmanEU: crims having nothing but chop
[3:21:15] mussball: crims set the bar cops meet it
[3:21:20] TheLadyCupcake: crim is npc interaction, cops is real people interaction
[3:21:27] LeoWurf: I think. Maybe they want to make charging crims super hard on cops. Because one charge messs them up forever @Deansocool
[3:21:30] heakr: they need to make the rolls just counterfeit money and then let the pd have a tool that lets them look and see if its fake
[3:21:31] Athasin: @Athasin I mean like checking the money for bank booby trap ink. Not checking for counterfeit. My fault, I should've explained it better.
[3:21:32] wearsc: be no police if there was no crime
[3:21:37] rayhxxn: The pc the pd got sold is a new crim item
[3:21:44] Money2Much: ame tbh only people i watch is k x 4head and u
[3:21:47] TheGoatstare: @LeoWurf it doesnt though, they get a fine and 50 mins in  jail max
[3:21:52] THE_Palmer1452: I mean, $3 a bag of weed doesn't seem like speedrunning, know what I mean LUL
[3:21:53] DoctorPez: Crims need kind a headstart to develop though before PD has all the tools they need to stop them
[3:21:53] brook_cs2: crim is slow you experienced it too its a fucking grind and not everyong is even out yet
[3:21:54] whimzyyyy: it is interesting cause from the start of 3.0 rolled bills were illegal but cash wasnt an actual item.
[3:21:56] ramsin50: a lot of the crim activity is based on waiting that's why
[3:21:56] BadRabbits: presumably crims are meant to outpace cops, then cops get new toys to catch back up and the cycle repeats
[3:21:58] sharrkuu: we're still far away from banks
[3:22:01] newtricksterx: pd just lacks a lot of systems in proving shit in court
[3:22:01] matthew_2210: i think they gotta set laws regarding the new game mechanics
[3:22:05] mannyman122: what games you playing off stream atm?
[3:22:06] freen87: the reason i say that is crims have cop guns and you know they have them but your not allowed to try to get it back
[3:22:08] marneraiders: @armedgolem01 does any NPC on the street actually talk to you. => No, so if he doesn‚Äôt talk to you it‚Äôs normal. But having an NPC be there for some people and for others not, is completely immersion breaking
[3:22:10] armedgolem01: 90% of the info cops have gotten has been from civs not crims
[3:22:13] tr0kgaming: K honestly are so far behind tbh they just having CIV fun
[3:22:14] THE_Palmer1452: Mhmmm
[3:22:17] EGGZOLENTZ: Yep
[3:22:17] BadRabbits: cops can't EVER be ahead of crims because it shuts down the enitre server
[3:22:19] dapyman: Exactly
[3:22:24] floppygator: i know it was on youur other character but to see all them washing machines in foreheads house compared to them not knowing how to clean money a few weeks ago
[3:22:24] slatt5: it makes sense that cops are a little behind because u want to build up crime lords/notorious crims then take them down for the story
[3:22:25] BalerionBlackDread: YES
[3:22:27] endstagettv: Even in life cops have to catch up to criminals
[3:22:27] Westlove_: crimes are way outpacing imo,
[3:22:28] DoctorPez: That neck though
[3:22:29] rayhxxn: Yeah. There's so many snitches
[3:22:30] MiracleWhip: it was the crims fault tho
[3:22:32] jkb_xD: When cops make 10x What anyone else makes. The easiest thing to do is snitch for money
[3:22:33] limerick2018: Snitching on person fine, snitching on mechanic ehhh
[3:22:33] ramsin50: i think they wanted cops to find out them selfs
[3:22:35] Athasin: Yeah guaranteed NO ONE expected jason to tell cops about the washing machines.
[3:22:36] LeoWurf: Yeah but they they get gated out of some mechincs if you get one felony @TheGoatstare
[3:22:36] THE_Palmer1452: Jason singing his ass off
[3:22:36] brook_cs2: crim is slow you experienced it too its a fucking grind and not everything is even out yet
[3:22:40] DonNiko99: deansoHi deansoHi deansoHi
[3:22:41] Broken99: all crim shit got snitched on within first 48h
[3:22:44] jupiterpuppetteer: you get all these people in jail With a little surveillance
[3:22:44] jammyjimmy: wow u don‚Äôt even respect deans old leader enough to watch him. that‚Äôs crazy
[3:22:46] TheGoatstare: theres like 3 crim jobs and it all got snitched in first week, so if that stuff was shut down theyd have nothing to do
[3:22:48] CazeTV: If they just make the rolls clearly without serial numbers that would be enough, so hopefully that‚Äôs something the devs can change, simple fix.
[3:22:50] TheGoatstare: @LeoWurf fair
[3:22:53] nationas: i dont think they want big investigation stuff yet
[3:22:55] xDeadLife_RS: I'm guessing Ruth is trying to slow the police down from bleeding the economy with rolled note charges.
[3:23:00] Jay_B06: Jayson Duerloooo
[3:23:04] tr0kgaming: Put it like this, if PD has to consult admins whether they can be corrupt it makes sense that it should be 100% the same for snitches @Deansocool
[3:23:07] armedgolem01: @marneraiders that makes 0 sense brother look up the word emersion
[3:23:10] THE_Palmer1452: I don't think your RP is wrong, I think just ahead of the curve they wanna be at, currently
[3:23:11] BadRabbits: I feel like it must be stupid difficult to RP getting things wrong even when you IRL know what's right.
[3:23:14] matthew_2210: trevor
[3:23:16] ramsin50: @Deansocool you basically did way too good of a job
[3:23:20] Kiwi_lul: tbh i get what ruth is TRYING to point out
[3:23:20] slatt5: yeah but the powergaming crims are grinding legal jobs to get tools to crim with
[3:23:27] freen87: In my honest opinion if you play a cop you should not have alts it needs to be solely a cop character to make sure the immersion is correct.
[3:23:30] hassan_cfc100: trev
[3:23:31] kb420ps: Key Scanners,  and Rolled Bills investigation is too fast.
[3:23:33] Raccoonuary: oh S%^ i thought gomer was a cop again before i looked at screen
[3:23:36] wearsc: police have a job because crime is committed
[3:23:37] LeoWurf: Idk I think tehy just want to give  crims the benefit of the doubt. If theres any doubt tehy wont charge them
[3:23:38] BDG_Toa676: One hell of a mullet deansoPa
[3:23:40] brook_cs2: this is what slacks and ruth been telling you tbh

[3:23:42] ajsleeper2: HUH
[3:23:43] Athasin: @xDeadLife_RS Nah I think she got instructions from "high command" (devs) to slow officers down while they work on mechanics
[3:23:44] Is_a_Red: lmao
[3:23:46] BadRabbits: EYO that's Steven Ogg
[3:23:47] HyperPerky: Since the inflation of hiring cars gone up. Not many people going to the hospital. But that all chance when people will get more guns.

[3:23:50] bluej255: lol
[3:23:50] iRawrTwice: xice was talking about it ooc, basically letting the server slowly build up, as the PD moves slow and get the pieces together slowly so the content keeps flowing, slowly building up investigations etc..

[3:29:04] matthew_2210: couldn‚Äôt criminals, just go and rat out criminal houses and what they have inside the houses to the cops. Wouldn‚Äôt this be too overpowered if there is no developer to look into it.
[3:29:08] khlaah: Look at that female officer that got Sr, with no reports or incidents at all, no arrests
[3:29:12] Athasin: @khlaah Only for him to get in trouble for pursuing a chase for too long
[3:29:27] dapyman: Hippopotamus Oath, lol
[3:29:27] HyperPerky: So if the crims / people get guns, when do we aspect to see the police be more equipped with rifles ?

[3:32:59] MexiBrent: the captains will still go through the reports and look at court cases so it won't really make a difference, one of the captains will get promoted or the sherieff will be one below them to keep it even in votes
[3:32:59] BadRabbits: turner and slacks might let her go to get rid of her :D
[3:33:03] Real23Phil: Deputy Sheriff Shiesty Hmm I like it
