[2:21:15] CasualStoner: dont bullets pierce through vehicles?
[2:21:40] magnets_: was aldo there?
[2:21:45] Lilliphus: @CasualStoner depends where you're shooting from?
[2:21:56] CasualStoner: point is, its still possible it was the pd?
[2:22:14] SimplyOrt: pretty much if any officers were facing the tanker while shooting its sus
[2:22:35] Lilliphus: sounds like everyone was to the side shooting through the window
[2:23:05] CasualStoner: problem is opening fire at a car so close to the tanker giving it even a chance of piercing through the vehicle and accidently cuasing an explosion
[2:23:27] Jaster_Reylu: well when ur senior officer says, "i need everyone to say we all shot at the cab" noone is gonna say they had line of sight on the tanker, are they
[2:23:32] Hudson_Pain: scoop the blood out, and vacuum the trunk
[2:23:45] Lilliphus: that's a hypothetical, they're arguing that they aren't responsible
[2:23:49] themanwithanrx7: IRL a bullet won't cause a tanker to explode anyways
[2:23:49] CasualStoner: ah i see, plausible too
[2:23:51] random_viewer_55: @CasualStoner can 9mm bullets pierce through a whole 16-wheeler??
[2:23:52] magnets_: YEP
[2:23:56] magnets_: only way to figure it out
[2:24:11] CasualStoner: it will be who has the best argument tbh...
[2:24:14] Kittriss: No way to prove ricochet in city right?
[2:24:16] AlteredData: NoThanks ew RP
[2:24:31] xMistressMayhem: Yeah
[2:24:58] random_viewer_55: it will be which is more probable
[2:24:59] Jaster_Reylu: i wonder how this new forensic system would have effected that tanker ordeal
[2:25:03] CasualStoner: @random_viewer_55 yes, im saying this because i saw a pov that it was literally facing the tanker and hitting the edge of the 16-wheeler...im not saying anything cuz its meta
[2:25:15] SimplyOrt: what if an officer says they dont know if they shot it or not? is that enough for mcnulty to call it off
[2:25:16] Jaster_Reylu: is it possible, bullets went thru truck cab
[2:25:30] Jaster_Reylu: just sayin, im not triyn to argue or anythign

[2:27:26] random_viewer_55: ye @CasualStoner which one seems more plausible
[2:27:43] SimplyOrt: theres one angle where the penetration matters and as far as we know no officers where in that angle
[2:27:45] bike_rider99: -1
[2:27:46] Hudson_Pain: NICE
[2:27:48] sBuon: chat

[2:27:59] SimplyOrt: welp

[7:08:51] Despoiler98: Actual question cause I dont know if the rules have changed with 4.0, is violence still supposed to require RP initiation first?
[7:08:53] vylkodav: Conflict well done = content and fun for everyone shotzSl
[7:08:55] JediJacob_: @PlethoraOfBees then blame the workers when they start fighting back

[7:09:38] AbeFroman2: like ruth and turner fighting, they are so good at that
[7:09:40] DancerRonin: As long as cops are the easiest source of guns some crims will just view cops as walking loot boxes.
[7:09:46] bluntguardian420: @mavericks312 thats a horrible idea
[7:09:55] Derickwith1R: true
[7:09:56] Despoiler98: you cant descalate when people jump out of a car and start shooting
[7:09:57] Caeros: it's literally the cop/criminal dynamic. one has rules. that's why there's 10,000 cop/crim shows and movies
[7:09:59] zentsk: u cant have criminal taking guns and pd doing nothing
[7:10:03] taginor: @Despoiler98 They had the character who interacted first with the police to be the "bait" in this situation.
[7:10:03] LostNomNom: But unfortunately they've been doing that

[7:10:38] Kurxx: Why do the crims even need guns, no one had guns, why did they need them
[7:10:42] lilisongss: its same 4 poeple taking the guns so its not to bad yet
[7:10:43] LostNomNom: Yeah but that doesn't really solve the problem by giving people gun licenses
[7:10:44] IzrevTheVirus: was the launch of 3.0 this rough in terms of cops/crim imbalance?
[7:10:46] SimplyOrt: will the civ gun serial be tied to names?
[7:10:49] MisterBikeShop: how many pd guns are missing today?
[7:10:50] ShaneOwens0: yeah 30k and a raid is huge
[7:10:51] BlueJustice_: time to up the fine to 60k
[7:10:53] crowgoes: When only a few people in the city have guns they are just so strong
[7:10:56] yaboizelda: ehhhh pd guns fine should be more than 30k tbh

[7:13:00] diermo: now you can KEKW
[7:13:03] zentsk: bobby
[7:13:11] woolfdesign: @caseus6199 Is he colluding with Archer? Susge
[7:13:12] deeezduckz: You, Cornwood and Slacks are my favorite cops. Keep up the good work!
[7:13:12] LostNomNom: That was funny but like wtf? lol
[7:13:20] WolfxPax: more cornwood and mcnulty team ups on investagations?
[7:13:29] john_notmylastname: Slacks also looks like Darkman lol
[7:13:30] clownfnuu: thats the cadet i think
[7:13:32] Zorfianna: PETTHEMODS

[7:13:49] sadldas: PETTHEMODS
[7:13:51] taginor: @DiaBeetusKoby Did I write something bad? Im sorry if I did!
[7:13:55] random_viewer_55: @jamieddd they already do
[7:13:57] kingshwing: Do you think it would be better or worse for the RP if guns had to be maintained on a daily basis?
[7:14:08] DiaBeetusKoby: !meta
[7:14:08] Nightbot: Metagaming is giving Custard information that his character does not know. Metagaming is strictly prohibited in this chat. Any offenders will be timed out, and repeat offenders may be banned. WeirdChamping Tssk
[7:14:09] woolfdesign: It shouldn't be either
[7:14:09] SmokieSatan: man I feel so bad for esfand getting dragged back on duty for this
[7:14:16] nookza: i think a perfect PD would be boring
[7:14:16] AbeFroman2: it will get better
[7:14:18] vylkodav: If crim RPers hate you (in character) you know you're doing a good job shotzLul
[7:14:20] jennindf: that area has been a warzone for days
[7:14:27] woolfdesign: Perfection isn't fun
[7:14:31] SunAerah: rameeLove rameeLove rameeLove rameeLove
[7:14:34] JediJacob_: it can only get better from here so here's hoping
[7:14:35] Mark14____: city is in tatters but makes great rp from both sides.. love it
[7:14:41] khrow: I think the DNA and forensics is gonna be a game changer though. There looked like a lot of crap on the ground at that scene
[7:14:49] HallJams: the swing from pd down bad to pd too powerful is always interesting to hear
[7:14:52] PolishGarnek: Cops Need Criminals, vice versa
[7:14:54] jamieddd: yea if was perfect the rp would be same shit different day. having fresh new characters is good
[7:14:56] mavericks312: perfect no but it’s basically non existent atm
[7:14:57] zentsk: being pd means u have take the whole city under protection. Criminals kinda do their on thing
[7:15:04] Kittriss: Hoppers... you're kinda cute ltcustFlower
[7:15:07] Caeros: @1nonlyjayson "if i were a crim how would i rob us" "staged arrest" then cornwood cross dresses again
[7:15:07] killogic916: At least things will get spicy soon. The new gun evidence thing has to mean crim guns are coming
[7:15:09] killogic916: right
[7:15:09] r6_ai: RP be like: Police don't catch me, if you do. I'll shoot you.
[7:15:14] RicoLoco52: who else has had any time to do any detective work other than denzel and aziz?
[7:15:17] nookza: the down bad PD storyline is producing some awesome RP
[7:15:26] floresulisess: true also first time chatter in here and I’ve been loving your Rp keep up the great work !!!
[7:15:33] AbeFroman2: yep just need numbers
[7:15:35] Nightbot: Come join the discord and fill up the ranks! https://discord.gg/PMrxK3F
[7:15:54] mavericks312: it’s just crazy how many crims say themselves is they need to just hire in mass and not be picky
[7:16:00] lawatiali: u playing crim anymore? @Lt_Custard
[7:16:02] AbeFroman2: i like crims that have no problem taking L's
[7:16:15] Estidal: @lawatiali Jerry Sweets is a crim
[7:16:16] saltyburgers12: massive time LULW
[7:16:16] khrow: do you play a crim character at all?
[7:16:17] LostNomNom: A lot of the crim side I feel like is immature
[7:16:18] killogic916: to be fair current 30k fine is a lot
[7:16:20] RAMEEKILLEDSAMBAAS: i mean Mr. K tried to go the civ route but the council shut down his business then the PD putting him on the 24hr hold turned him back to crime lol
[7:16:20] Azure_96: Definitely
[7:16:25] PolishGarnek: To be Fair K lost his entire buisness  and Investors Money
[7:16:25] ShaneOwens0: do the crime do the time YEP
[7:16:28] its_exodos808: and same to you guys though
[7:16:28] timedoggg: sure but g6 pays more than crime
[7:16:30] AbeFroman2: dont do the crime lol
[7:16:32] sadldas: @lawatiali he prioritizes cop but does have a crim
[7:16:36] Estidal: @khrow He used to play the VP of BBMC yes he knows crime haha
[7:16:37] SunAerah: my stripper cant rameeHands rameeHands rameeHands rameeHands rameeHands
[7:16:41] jamieddd: yea u gartered a massive l if caught with the gun lol
[7:16:41] n_x_l_l: does that mean mcnulty is more susceptible to crims that take accountability for their actions?
[7:16:41] HallJams: I don't think it's that much tbh
[7:16:44] Kittriss: consequences is his #1 want for 4.0
[7:16:50] vylkodav: Is it down bad PD if just from stolen guns crims have lost a total over 500K shotzLul
[7:16:50] AbeFroman2: theres already barely any consequences
[7:16:52] spammed300: i think 30k is very fair right now
[7:16:52] killogic916: 30k is like 30 hrs of crim RP
[7:16:57] random_viewer_55: consequences of your actions, tough luck
[7:16:58] AbeFroman2: take away 30k fines and its too easy
[7:16:59] PolishGarnek: It's like week or 2
[7:17:02] khrow: 30k isn't even that bad anymore, the economy is startin to get healthy
[7:17:11] iniblu: what is the penalty when a cop arrests the wrong person?
[7:17:15] goddamnsoul: Crime shouldn't be to easy
[7:17:17] zentsk: u cant put a bullet on someone and take 200 dollars fine's
[7:17:19] DeAngeIIo: it is fair
[7:17:23] KayanivG: But why only crims face consequence?
[7:17:24] Evezh_: its the law of fuck around and find out plain and simple
[7:17:26] VSDuck: @killogic916 Then don't do the crime AAAA
[7:17:26] mavericks312: @vylkodav crims are suppose to lose money for making dumbass decisions
[7:17:28] Mark14____: yeah trying to make it as real as it can be
[7:17:29] jamieddd: @khrow think it's like 12h
[7:17:32] mad0monk: Slacks patiently waiting for you lol
[7:17:33] AbeFroman2: did you not hear about Dean?
[7:17:35] killogic916: @killogic916 its GTA brop
[7:17:35] AbeFroman2: chatter
[7:17:39] synthbreaknetcat: ohhh noo suspension!
[7:17:40] SmokieSatan: well 30k was just for possession not even for stealing lol
[7:17:42] agestone: it's should 50k now with economy
[7:17:50] mavericks312: den an cornwood are at 9 and 8 daps
[7:17:54] lawatiali: cpt ruth? @Lt_Custard haha
[7:17:55] iniblu: Ruth?
[7:17:55] synthbreaknetcat: JAIL should be the thing for cops
[7:18:03] CasualStoner: shitty police work happens in real life and it will happen in rp. its good content either way
[7:18:03] PolishGarnek: @agestone once Banks gets unlocked ye
[7:18:13] vylkodav: @mavericks312 100% i'm just saying i don't think PD is down bad as people make it out to be LUL
[7:18:25] warmachine89: @khrow I don't think I'd call that healthy. What it needs is more variety to distribute people away from grime and group6. People being fantastically rich erodes the effect of consequences, which IMO is bad for RP.
[7:18:25] Despoiler98: I think it should be heavier I think you should have to spend weeks in jail but I think the server is insanely tilted in favor of crims right now
[7:18:25] cloudymg82: U got that good RP all the time homie
[7:18:33] DancerRonin: It’s almost like when you go out and break the law there’s a greater chance of consequences than for police possibly making a mistake.
[7:18:34] petkojeskral: @agestone Not really only g6 makes money even that is 2k every 30mins or so rest is like 300 every hour
[7:18:35] random_viewer_55: @SmokieSatan you can't prove who stole it. Possession is the charge at the moment
[7:18:40] lawatiali: gotcha
[7:19:00] Wyatt_x: what kind of reaction to consequences dont you like? like when they take you to court? or like when they hold a grudge against that cop. because that happens in real life right? is it something else they do?
[7:19:00] Despoiler98: understandable
[7:19:01] iniblu: I appreciate you answering questions.
[7:19:05] Azure_96: Healthiest way to play
[7:19:05] MisterBikeShop: rcdHutt
[7:19:06] duggurg2: @petkojeskral g6 is 2k every 3 hours
[7:19:15] SmokieSatan: @random_viewer_55 well you can get caught in the act and I’m sure there would be additional charges
[7:19:20] Mark14____: the whole Ruth situation is definitely brewing
[7:19:22] PolishGarnek: I wish Every Roleplayer Had that Mindset
[7:19:36] killogic916: @duggurg2 but thats not crim rp
[7:19:39] SunAerah: rameeLove rameeLove rameeLove rameeLove rameeLove
[7:19:41] AbeFroman2: yeah i like that we can discuss ooc here, and not just be told "its just rp" good community here
[7:19:45] muricapewpew: the RP lately has been pretty good lately. All the grinding RP was getting a little monotonous
[7:19:55] Despoiler98: yeah the ones who flip out they are getting prison time when they've been caught red handed for violent felonies is absurd
[7:20:00] killogic916: @duggurg2 actual crim rp is less than 1k per hour
[7:20:01] BobFromAccounts: robbing and assassinating cops should be met with time in prison even if it is a game. this is RP. big problem with the server in my observation is a lack of a function prison.
[7:20:14] random_viewer_55: @SmokieSatan almost nobody gets caught in the act. They play it so safe that 95% of the time they get away with the initial robbing
[7:20:15] SunAerah: Eugene
[7:20:25] AbeFroman2: they complain its too easy but then complain when cops do their job sometimes
[7:20:26] lilisongss: that would work great if it not prison first then go court
[7:20:30] Wyatt_x: oooh yeah thats just over the top. i agree!
[7:20:30] robertsmithjr: @BobFromAccounts would have to agree
[7:20:33] Despoiler98: @BobFromAccounts yeah prison time is not high enough
[7:20:37] warmachine89: @muricapewpew This.
[7:20:39] SunAerah: its always Eugene
[7:20:47] PolishGarnek: What happened to Leo
[7:21:00] MisterBikeShop: KappaRoss  Slacks quick recovery
[7:21:01] AbeFroman2: he got shot in the eye
[7:21:16] duggurg2: @killogic916 well, you dont need to only to crim rp to earn money
[7:21:18] MisterBikeShop: shot in face 3x
[7:21:23] VSDuck: @BobFromAccounts I'm like 95% sure the prison has been updated and works now
[7:21:30] BobFromAccounts: I have read NoPixels rules and what’s going on in this server does not align with what their rules and mission statement is
[7:21:36] SmokieSatan: @random_viewer_55 yeah that’s great and all but you can still prove who stole it…
[7:22:17] AbeFroman2: he just wants to shoot someone i love it lol
[7:22:19] Despoiler98: shugrvFine shugrvFine shugrvFine shugrvFine poor cornwood wants to help
[7:22:23] random_viewer_55: @SmokieSatan no you can't. Once the inital situation is over, since they do it with masks and shit, you can't know who that person was even if you find the gun later.
[7:22:25] synthbreaknetcat: @BobFromAccounts ??? what rules lol
[7:22:33] Kittriss: he's spiraling Sadge
[7:22:52] mavericks312: bro you can hear it esfands voice he can’t take much more
[7:22:58] BobFromAccounts: @vsduck it isn’t staffed. it’s the size of a 300+ person prison and the server only holds 220 people lol
[7:23:00] Vespene34: Cornwood breaking down D:
[7:23:08] magnets_: he's gonna burn himself out
[7:23:09] MisterBikeShop: LUL  G6 joker
[7:23:13] SimplyOrt: @mavericks312 hes choosing to involve by being on duty
[7:23:35] da5id_h: we need RoboCornwood
[7:23:39] killogic916: @BobFromAccounts @BobFromAccounts its also a heavily streamed server, huge jail times just arent good for the health of the reason people watch this server
[7:23:50] robertsmithjr: i dunno, we all have likes anddislikes etc, what we like for rp, personally i dont really think crime crime crime, steal gun, shoot cop, rinse and repeat is rp, at least its not very creative rp anyway
[7:23:54] mavericks312: we need 3.0 cornwood at this point
[7:24:10] fellathedude: @Vespene34 He vas venting to Juno, sounded tired
[7:24:15] SmokieSatan: @random_viewer_55 you arguing something completely situational…it is COMPLETELY possible to prove you just have to catch them in the act and like I said I’m sure there is an additional charge for that…like you can spin it how ever you want it is possible…
[7:24:33] goddamnsoul: Hmm so civs are cracking Hmm
[7:24:38] AbeFroman2: curious why they dont make all cops able to FTO
[7:24:40] BobFromAccounts: @killogic916 the server isn’t thriving right now. no one wants to play a game where you can’t do a basic job in RP without getting robbed and stabbed
[7:24:46] PolishGarnek: Cops and Crims is like Stanford Experiment, Gotta reel things back so it Doesn't get bad
[7:25:03] AbeFroman2: hes on that doom train LUL
[7:25:03] random_viewer_55: @SmokieSatan If you don't catch them in the inital situation, it's over. You can't prove who stole it.
[7:25:16] MisterBikeShop: cocTalk  tax the bullets
[7:25:21] SmokieSatan: @random_viewer_55 peanut had warrant for stealing it did he not?
[7:25:32] DoctorPez: Geez the amount of complaining from Cornwood
[7:25:42] buuutty: cornwood is spiraling
[7:25:43] random_viewer_55: @SmokieSatan because he was IDed on scene.
[7:25:45] Gaz_H20: you got a view on a lot of people hating Ruth? both crims & cops
[7:25:48] killogic916: @BobFromAccounts its GTA
[7:25:54] SmokieSatan: @doctorpez cause he don’t wana be here rn
[7:25:59] magnets_: yep
[7:26:00] kasper952: AAAA
[7:26:00] Nightbot: AAAA
[7:26:01] magnets_: YEP
[7:26:01] themanwithanrx7: I think you are
[7:26:01] Estidal: @Gaz_H20 Hm thats not fishing for a clip
[7:26:02] Despoiler98: shugrvLove shugrvLove shugrvLove PETTHEDISPATCHERS
[7:26:04] SmokieSatan: @random_viewer_55 so they proved who it was….
[7:26:04] themanwithanrx7: your used to it
[7:26:07] themanwithanrx7: they are all freaking out
[7:26:07] juliaswing: AAAA

[7:26:09] UrsaMinor5432: you can survive anything now
[7:26:10] VSDuck: BBMC is the down bad of down bad
[7:26:11] Zorfianna: AAAA
[7:26:11] WhoIsD33z: @DoctorPez wait till you see his chat
[7:26:12] BrandonE911: this isnt even down bad by BBMC standards
[7:26:15] CTRSWebb: it’s been 2 months of picking up trash
[7:26:16] sadldas: AAAA
[7:26:17] J0urin: AAAA
[7:26:18] skinnylegend000: Used to playing on extra hard mode.
[7:26:18] Kittriss: Dundee and his money management skills makes this easy mode
[7:26:18] brittania519: youve become immune AAAA
[7:26:19] pappardelle_papi: oh SHIT! thats where i recognize the voice
[7:26:19] BobFromAccounts: lol ok Killlogic
[7:26:20] plawpsruby: This is a walk on the park for you
[7:26:20] JasonVoorhees71: desensitised
[7:26:21] RobRoads: Everyone loves it till cops get shot it seems like
[7:26:23] jabbaw0cky: Cop RPers: we are downbad. Custy: this is up good!
[7:26:25] SmokieSatan: @random_viewer_55 crazy how that can happen
[7:26:26] random_viewer_55: @SmokieSatan most tryhards just mask on and rob. and that's 95% of reobberies
[7:26:30] AbeFroman2: well tbf him and dean were the only ppl available -while you guys were busy with 80- at 7pm
[7:26:31] muricapewpew: doesn’t help that Cornwood is on for 20 hours a day! lol
[7:26:31] themanwithanrx7: 3 years for always down bad BBMC will do that to a man lol
[7:26:33] wizwonder: its like that Bane quote, you were born in the darkness
[7:26:34] SimplyOrt: why cant people just roll with it its rp, if pd is down bad then rp a down bad pd???
[7:26:38] detoksi: if your only upgood you wont really enjoy when you get to be good after being downbad
[7:26:40] jdoug4444: Colin sold meth on a park bench by the road, he's been through some shit Kappa
[7:26:41] synthbreaknetcat: @random_viewer_55 yeah?? whos gonna wear no mask lmao
[7:26:43] sadldas: one eye
[7:26:46] killogic916: its fine, once crims have their own guns they wont be targetting cops as much (unless the crim gun charge is also 30k)
[7:26:47] PolishGarnek: Need Crims to Go On Cops and Have  their Fun, And Cops to swap to Crims
[7:26:49] Kittriss: BondiUpGood
[7:26:55] robertsmithjr: ruth is a great captain, she adds a dynamic pd needs, she just doesnt put up with bs
[7:27:02] synthbreaknetcat: @SimplyOrt EXACTLY people want pd to get W's every time and crims to lose lmao
[7:27:05] random_viewer_55: @synthbreaknetcat well that's why the big charge is the possession.
[7:27:08] starriiiiii: BondiUpGood
[7:27:10] Zorfianna: BondiUpGood
[7:27:12] HeavyMetalKittenx: Tips tobiiiLove
[7:27:14] SmokieSatan: @random_viewer_55 im not saying it isn’t I’m saying it is possible to prove who stole it…idk how more simply I could put it man
[7:27:16] themanwithanrx7: The cap really shouldn't be on duty hah
[7:27:20] lynnchesque: once crims have guns, they'll shoot to get away from every chase lol
[7:27:21] muricapewpew: I dig your roleplay outlook 🤘
[7:27:21] AbeFroman2: well you are probably in the minority there
[7:27:25] killogic916: @PolishGarnek yep, the best cops played crim heavily and vice versa
[7:27:26] RobRoads: It make amazing RP for us viewers
[7:27:26] Invicerous: This is a good challenge
[7:27:31] WhoIsD33z: theyre in ICU btw
[7:27:35] ZilzGaming: cornwood is pulling 16 hour shifts

[7:28:01] robertsmithjr: rp
[7:28:03] random_viewer_55: @SmokieSatan Well. I don't know how more simply I could put it either. The possession charge is the one that is big because 95% of the time it's the only one that can be proven.
[7:28:07] Kiwo: i mean
[7:28:08] asebass: @RobRoads But if it breaks all the cops, it has a short run.  It's only good if it can be sustained

[7:28:35] SmokieSatan: @random_viewer_55 Jesus you have hard time admitting when your wrong
[7:28:41] Edward_Theodore: i dont think its about how much time they are puting but about being happy to play

[7:52:30] WhosHumble: @Battlehooves wanted for questions
[7:52:31] SIeeptic: That's hard, I'm sure McNulty "knows" but there's a difference between knowing and being able to prove.

[7:53:07] nondescript33: cant blood be from another scenario?
[7:53:08] bander2016: no i assumed he was one of the guys with a crowbar
[7:53:08] Kittriss: That's enough to get him in for questioning
[7:53:09] bird24287: enough for PC
[7:53:09] duckuru: Alibi?
[7:53:11] alyx_bunny43: @sog_jedijacob thank you so much ltcustLove I have a follow up question in there too btw
[7:53:12] synthbreaknetcat: @jamieddd yeah but sadly it wont hhelp

[7:53:32] bird24287: woof what is that hair
[7:53:32] Xierany: But just suspicion, nothing to convict?
[7:53:35] KillerKolsch: guys go binge CSI if you wanna get crazy
[7:53:37] synthbreaknetcat: @SoulYou_ no case only questioning for benji
[7:53:41] synthbreaknetcat: @Xierany nope
[7:54:01] MisterBikeShop: rcdBoomer  dna takes a few days to process
[7:54:02] SIeeptic: chat being confidently wrong is par for the course
[7:54:08] troyofathyns: oh is that fingerprints then?
[7:54:10] medium_5: blood on scene? sounds like the robbers beat him up aswell then, how else would he be bleeding
[7:54:12] SoulYou_: @synthbreaknetcat just talking about the case as a whole
[7:54:16] SunAerah: take mine
[7:54:18] JediJacob_: @alyx_bunny43 responded to you
[7:54:19] PrivateSyaz: Only felons get DNA on file but Benji has been arrested for participating in war so his DNA is on file
[7:54:31] synthbreaknetcat: @SIeeptic wrong about?
[7:54:41] magnets_: can y'all find dna on casings or just casings match ?
[7:54:44] jamieddd: @medium_5 yea he could say that or fly out the car that y it broke lol
[7:54:44] Xierany: @medium_5 Cops managed to get a few in return before going down
[7:54:53] duckuru: if u put a warrant for him, do you need to take his alibi?
[7:55:03] jdoug4444: If you chop off their fingers when you arrest them, you can match fingerprints AND DNA LUL
[7:55:26] SoulYou_: would you say that the problems that the PD have right now line up with the history? New gov. etc. @Lt_Custard
[7:55:27] SIeeptic: Tough case but 100% he needs to be questioned regardless.
[7:55:32] WhosHumble: @duckuru they put a bolo, because of lack of evidence

[8:02:26] gorofs: Pizza party
[8:02:28] gorofs: works every time
[8:02:34] plawpsruby: Custy not everyone has done 3 years of bbmc rp
[8:02:44] OminousEinherjar: Guess captains need to do more to help morale too
[8:02:55] Xierany: Does the cap of 6 matter for PD, or is that just for gang vs gang?
[8:02:56] goddamnsoul: Bondi moments the pd
[8:02:57] I3eCynical: @gorofs my job be like
[8:03:02] random_viewer_55: what can you do though? Nothing
[8:03:04] JediJacob_: mcnulty for CoP
[8:03:16] skinnylegend000: morale boosters?  like Reward Points (+1 RP) for good stuff seniors can give out.
[8:03:17] themanwithanrx7: prob worth a long convo with some of them when stuff is a bit more relaxed
[8:03:23] random_viewer_55: McNulty even said to not overdo it and take time off
[8:03:33] Kittriss: I think Slacks had the right idea with the proposed PD party. Cops stress and release from stress is both being on duty, need work life separation
[8:03:36] synthbreaknetcat: @Xierany only crim vs crims which is why its dumb people say PD is weak lmao, pd can have many cops as they want
[8:03:41] plawpsruby: I feel a conversation with all captains will be good
[8:03:48] Xierany: Well the more guns end up on the street you could end up in a big shootout, in which you'd throw every cop at it
[8:03:55] CrazyKoyaso: YO I JUST GOTTA SAY YOU A TRUE G AMAZING RPER
[8:03:55] WhosHumble: yea ngl the fact cornwood went off duty scares me
[8:03:57] JediJacob_: you also spend time off duty irp getting to know people and experience the civ side of things
[8:04:07] EPiQ: I think its the perception they're helping by putting in extra hours.
[8:04:22] taytoeGG: Officer Lumberjack!
[8:04:28] OminousEinherjar: He should play Cornwood off duty for a couple of hours every day tbh
[8:04:32] laaazylemon: im fairly new to watching rp, is it really considered good rp if you just mow down cops like this?
[8:04:34] EPiQ: Esfand always seems positive the first 7-9 hours...then it goes downhill for 6-7
[8:04:53] plawpsruby: Is kian worried with how cornwood is reacting on radio with him saying he wants to shoot someone?
[8:04:53] WhosHumble: @laaazylemon can be, but only if done well
[8:05:34] Caeros: @EPiQ he needs daily sunlight and watering
[8:05:52] bander2016: lol
[8:06:03] EPiQ: @EPiQ hahaha truth.
[8:06:08] maggsrags: Could you put a loose hourly on duty limit for deputies and solo cadets to keep people from running the risk of burnout? Rp it as no overtime?
[8:07:15] SoulYou_: well u got a 77 with an entrance
[8:07:56] bander2016: does officer bobby stream?
[8:07:57] Kittriss: IDK maybe donuts for each shift?
[8:08:13] WhosHumble: @bander2016 sometimes, Shiny is the twitch
[8:08:30] JediJacob_: i think this is a conversation that needs to be had with slacks
[8:08:36] random_viewer_55: @bander2016 not now
[8:08:38] bander2016: @WhosHumble ty
[8:09:04] Kittriss: Yeah @sog_jedijacob
[8:09:38] random_viewer_55: I don't think Slacks can do anything about that
[8:09:46] random_viewer_55: It's up to the individuals
[8:10:00] Xierany: Does she know what 10-60 means? Kappa
[8:10:12] Despoiler98: 10 60 is stolen?
[8:10:12] J0urin: Hmm
[8:10:17] random_viewer_55: yes @Despoiler98
[8:10:18] Xierany: @Despoiler98 y
[8:10:25] sadldas: @Despoiler98 yup
[8:10:34] Despoiler98: ok my ten codes were different then
[8:10:57] Despoiler98: my 10 60 was suspicious activity
[8:10:59] Kittriss: That's a surprise, not running
[8:11:05] SoulYou_: i think people in PD want to push for recruitment of experienced people like rivers
[8:11:06] random_viewer_55: @Despoiler98 you're irl cop, or you play on different server with other codes?
[8:12:03] plawpsruby: Might be good tomorrow if able to get a meeting with the captains
[8:13:08] Kittriss: Prayge McNulty won't get stabbed Prayge
[8:13:13] Despoiler98: @random_viewer_55 used to be private security but we copied local 10 codes cause we used one of the local county sheriff radio channels and they would back us up
[8:13:36] Despoiler98: @random_viewer_55 they were really nice to help us out
[8:13:36] random_viewer_55: cool

[8:14:59] random_viewer_55: what's the server time?
[8:15:00] SoulYou_: i think
[8:15:01] rnAlsation: The PD is haunted.

[8:19:59] CrazyKoyaso: lol keep doing your thin homie love the content you and everybody have been creating, i have been absolutely glued to nopixel
[8:20:02] SoulYou_: Yes, I will. Yes, I did
[8:20:58] plawpsruby: You can try but also hard if people are not coming to you with issues because you can't help out if you don't know what the issue is
[8:21:25] Kittriss: Achieving goals usually helps with doom spiraling in my experience
[8:21:48] csacdfw: imagine on the other side trying to create competent crims…
[8:21:50] Rayvohs: can PD call tow like in 3.0 yet?
[8:22:36] random_viewer_55: IMO the best advice for burnout is that at the end of the day it's just a game. Take a breath and enjoy the ride, and if you don't stop playing.
[8:22:36] SoulYou_: i think connecting the casings between slack's accident and this one is huge tbh
