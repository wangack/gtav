[1:42:29] dodgy_divan: PREACH
[1:42:31] YunnusAbi: @VengeanceUM well yeah obviously, but in most cases they do.
[1:42:32] PuffyChocolatee: NOTED
[1:42:32] SniperNaDiaper26: 1 night stands can give you something ajax and a brillo pad cant get off

[1:43:04] leemorales17: 1 night stands are high risks of STDs
[1:43:04] TheD0ngerLord56: one night stands emotionally ruin your chances for a normal realtionship
[1:43:06] miyawastakenn: i had 2, it was okay, but i do agree, kinda akward
[1:43:07] TheRejectsAzFTwitch: One night stands suuuuck. Guys have to put in a shit ton of work to pull girls LUL
