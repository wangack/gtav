[1:34:08] EsfandTV: btw about you liking to mix things up with the PD in the past, I think that's what made PD so good. idk because I barely played 2.0 but I always remember hearing that putting characters in the right position made the beginning of 3.0 PD amazing
[1:34:10] iMoore_: rajj n ice went wild
[1:34:11] Dyslecsic: i used to watch him in his goofy blue shirt playing runescape
