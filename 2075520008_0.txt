[1:21:07] Danination: Amen to that
[1:21:29] cqmer0n_193: pd trying to push a charge against cornwood for murder

[1:22:17] dxnielll8233: Absolute grafta
[1:22:33] gabzzsu: the Three captains are cancers in the PD. the PD has already failed faster than 3.0 PD did.

[1:23:14] Bi0_: first thing ever said in chat too...
[1:23:16] arcswo: To be fair: the PD isn't pressing any charge. They just got opinions of lawyers because if they didn't and he was charged it would look like the PD covered up a crime. It's also people complaining because they got in trouble lol
[1:23:22] VarakTV: @gabzzsu who are the 3 captains?

[1:24:06] lyriism: @danda1orian hi! ltcustHappyCustard
[1:24:07] BakinPacman: its getting brutal lately
[1:24:11] arcswo: Cheever is excellent at roleplay and her character is great. Her character is literally influencing the entire city.
[1:24:25] BigDutchBag: Cheever got so much shit when she was mayor
[1:24:25] BakinPacman: oh siege is great PepeLaugh
[1:24:43] Danination: Yo fuck yeah former kitchen staff, I was a line and prep cook for about a decade.

[1:24:48] Death6707: KEKW
[1:24:57] RadahTatTat: @cqmer0n_193 you have a very biased POV. should probably just listen to what Custard is saying instead of poppin off in chat KEKW
[1:24:57] Asmodean01: It's a show that things can be changed, if you follow chain of command imho
[1:24:57] BigDutchBag: Look without Ruth there wouldnt be this much great RP that has come
[1:25:11] BakinPacman: its a live drama LUL
[1:25:12] Bojabes: is this song by strfkr?
[1:25:29] Madam4721: consequences brings more rp imo
[1:25:41] WildWillie419: Ruth suspended herself so PD is fixed forever anyhow, right? saabKEK
[1:25:55] Madam4721: yep exactly
[1:25:58] gandalftheworst: Comms be great tonight huh
[1:25:59] RadahTatTat: NODDERS exactly
[1:26:02] arcswo: It feels like children getting in trouble in highschool then they run to their parents and blame the school for them messing up lol
[1:26:03] Lucsvm: GIGACHAD
[1:26:16] Bi0_: @WildWillie419 she had to.  You're auto on leave once you have criminal charges iirc.
[1:26:19] Asmodean01: Take in on the chin and roll with it. You have a few daps yourself, yet you aren't doom spiraling.
[1:26:38] Madam4721: I am a former 911 dispatcher and there are rules in departments for a reason and if you don't follow them you get in trouble it is that simple
[1:26:41] BakinPacman: the dog with the fluffy toy and the fluff all over the floor
[1:26:44] WildWillie419: @bi0_ I know, it was poking fun at Ruth hate
[1:26:45] BigDutchBag: But she doesnt have criminal chargers yet
[1:26:54] Switchblade142: @Asmodean01 i mean it's a bit more than just daps now right? sorry if meta
[1:27:02] Buster_Buster: Shang PepeLaugh
[1:27:03] Bi0_: But also that's what makes the RP great is the different reactions to these things happening.
[1:27:08] RadahTatTat: Shang Susge
[1:27:10] arcswo: The whole thing started over daps.
[1:27:11] Danination: As a character, Ruth brings a lot of stark accountability which has been stellar for roleplay. People angry at her or Cheever need a reality check.
[1:27:23] catfish_quackenbush: to be fair, cornwood took accountability for all of it, except one DAP. Some others are doomspiraling with the DAPs
[1:27:33] monkz89: "all of PD doing terrible" = cornball den and aziz LUL
[1:27:35] Lucsvm: @catfish_quackenbush no he dont lol
[1:27:40] ocelotalickum: The cornwood thing just feels like he's being forced to perma
[1:27:42] arcswo: I have noticed Cheever doesn't go live a lot anymore and I hope its not because of people harassing her.
[1:27:47] spuds3432: wait who has a UTI
[1:27:49] RadahTatTat: @catfish_quackenbush that‚Äôs cap KEKW
[1:27:53] BigDutchBag: People get too invested. Its not reality

[1:28:08] Lucsvm: KEKW
[1:28:09] Madam4721: yep
[1:28:12] Death6707: the 1% is turning into the majority of being heard
[1:28:16] grace_: yep
[1:28:18] BooksBlanketsandTea: YEP
[1:28:21] catfish_quackenbush: @Danination yea thats what is f0ing crazy, the amount of people that cant seperate streamer from character
[1:28:24] WildWillie419: the charismatic people got DAPed saabKEK
[1:28:25] Bi0_: I think it's like 80+ cops and 17 -TOTAL- have/had daps.
[1:28:27] BigDutchBag: But theres a difference with McNulty though. He makes sure to tell peole they are doing good and bad
[1:28:28] RadahTatTat: it‚Äôs a very small core group of complainers that are in COGGERS convos all day KEKW
[1:28:29] BigDutchBag: not just bad
[1:28:40] Madam4721: like don't get in trouble if you can't take the consequences
[1:28:42] IllIIIIll: whats a DAP?
[1:28:44] arcswo: The mayor is also using cornwood and cornwood as a character doesn't realize it lol
[1:28:49] gorofs: gorofs subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months, currently on a 29 month streak! 
[1:28:56] grace_: @IllIIIIll disciplinary action point

[1:28:59] warmachine89: Oh my god are we still on DAPs?
[1:29:03] SCPFFFF: isnt it fair to say you hate the captains as if this were a tv show? like joffrey baratheon from game of thrones
[1:29:21] SavageDerg: @grace_ Ah okie
[1:29:22] RobRoads: To be fair the core group getting dap'd and, imo, the very funny and very entertaining ones. Reno 911 style and that's just funny
[1:29:27] monkz89: gotta love the misinformation too: turner gone for a month, ruth never there LUL
[1:29:36] twinrage4231: @grace_ thanks, was about to ask the same question :)

[1:30:18] warmachine89: Does that mean he's speaking Swedish, or that he's talking like a muppet?
[1:30:25] alyx_bunny43: You can dislike a character without talking shit about the streamer/actor @scpffff
[1:30:26] RadahTatTat: a DAP is a form of greeting like a hi-5 but with your fist peepoGiggles
[1:30:31] SCPFFFF: @Lucsvm yeah they arent actually captains theyre streamers
[1:31:17] ocelotalickum: daps per hours on duty seems more fair, but it might complicate it too
[1:31:21] Lucsvm: WideSusge
[1:31:39] nme1025: hey, what is going on here? did someone rob the and burger?
[1:31:40] ItsMrBooty: You should be able to work off daps I feel like
[1:31:40] RadahTatTat: @scpffff funny you made that comparison cuz the actor who played Joffrey (a child) got so much hate for that role he quit acting altogether KEKW maybe you should keep that in mind
[1:31:42] BakinPacman: just regulate your hours basically
[1:31:47] watermelon3001: sniffthenewchatter  Û†ÄÄ
[1:31:57] memeoverload69: hello chat :)

[1:32:58] ChirithyChi: Skill difference
[1:33:00] BakinPacman: yeah its just self regulation
[1:33:12] ggsz: rookie numbers cornwood does 16+ hours
[1:33:13] nme1025: i like how everyone is moving in like a convoy as the cops. is this city that crazy?

[1:33:37] BakinPacman: KEKW
[1:33:38] Semantha: Cornwood just doesn't feel like he fits this PD, I am a fan of the character, he'll be better outside the PD as a lawyer or whatever.
[1:33:46] RadahTatTat: LETHIMCOOK
[1:33:49] ggsz: @Lucsvm +1 ill sit back down
[1:33:58] nme1025: o why micro management?
[1:34:03] Bi0_: LUL
[1:34:06] SCPFFFF: @RadahTatTat i mean the writers made him a hateable charactor and he pulled it off really well.  people talked about it. i dont really see that as a bad thing. Some people cant seperate the actor from charactor I guess..
[1:34:12] nme1025: is that how it is normally?
[1:34:12] arcswo: Cornwood the character is letting the mayor take advantage of his situation. I wonder if he will ever figure it out.

[1:34:47] god__turkey: @SCPFFFF Joffreys actor was sent death threats. He wasnt just a hated character
[1:34:57] BoneKiller406: Did Cornwood meet with higher ups again today?
[1:35:07] RadahTatTat: @scpffff exactly, but I was just saying that he isn‚Äôt a great example to use since he was LITERALLY bullied away from acting (for fear of his life)
[1:35:19] SCPFFFF: @god__turkey yeah theyre are dumb people in the world
[1:35:21] skinnylegend000: they operate more as a team which seems more fun when they‚Äôve got a bit of group quest assigning management Mcnulty does sometimes.

[3:14:39] KaycasTV: you done fucked up firing Cornwood UltraMad
[3:14:41] judge_hat: cornwood has a lot of fans in pd who would feel betrayed
[3:14:46] Haffsack: the mayor is going to be there
[3:14:49] DancerRonin: There‚Äôs gonna be so much Reddit drama.
[3:14:52] SarahFlare: Custard, what do you think about SBS in general? Bc that's where most of this occurred. How should it be handled moving forward?
[3:14:55] afroakatsuki: lacSip
[3:15:01] magnets_: i hope the mayor tries to make mcnulty stay lmfao. that walk away is gonna be sick
[3:15:10] HibikiHikariVT: @judge_hat tbh most dont care if he is fired. its that nobody is being listened to.
[3:15:10] RainbowTacos1108: kivaSip
[3:15:11] themanwithanrx7: The PD needs a proper meeting room for the cpt's lol
[3:15:11] DancerRonin: Gamba on screaming please?
[3:15:16] Lilliphus: sbs has its time and place
[3:15:19] themanwithanrx7: having these meeting in a closet is comical
[3:15:21] TehDobster: Feel like there is a pretty thin line between comedy cops and clowns?
[3:15:25] dreggy69: the server needs rules for it imo
[3:15:29] Lalgil: hahaha it's Cornwood and the Mayor  there will be screaming lol
[3:15:30] Crazith: SBS is way to hard to keep IC IMO
[3:15:31] DiaBeetusKoby: rp comes first
[3:15:36] ThePointGaming: the issue also...is if Cornwood is fired/tried for murder...what stops other people from creating an SBS character to GET people in trouble
[3:15:45] themanwithanrx7: SBS being serious RP is the best
[3:15:46] TheBFG_01: I mean, there isn‚Äôt an SBS exemption
[3:15:46] DiaBeetusKoby: SBS turns into serious rp 90% of the time
[3:15:47] drreaper39: sad
[3:15:51] leafinglikes: OMEGALUL
[3:15:55] judge_hat: we can make a law that says donald bush's dont have rights

[3:16:00] spuds3432: AAAA
[3:16:00] Nightbot: AAAA
[3:16:03] skinnylegend000: it happened in character. consequences are in character. the characters don‚Äôt know what SBS is.
[3:16:09] SireOfTheLake: @SarahFlare Someone's SBS can become someone's serious RP which is how fun RP happens imo.
[3:16:21] th1122: if your SBS ends up involving 7+ people you just have to let them rp it out
[3:16:25] Caeros: Frost also seemed to have had an issue for bantering
[3:16:38] SarahFlare: @SireOfTheLake That's true, but it's also created IRL consequences which is really sucky.
[3:16:41] Bosweny: this is an incredibly bad path to go down
[3:16:43] yetisarentreal: Mccnulty is a company man EZ
[3:16:59] Lilliphus: if you sbs then you have to accept that the other party may not see it as sbs and be willing to face the consequences Shruge
[3:17:00] Danination: Ruth and Turner are trying to implement a more serious, stronger sense of responsibility, and people keep bucking at it.
[3:17:00] maggsrags: This music is so fun and lighthearted
[3:17:11] magnets_: a dad.gum.shit.show.
[3:17:14] Leritt: YEP
[3:17:20] magnets_: malton is the best person to witness this
[3:17:27] SarahFlare: Regardless, this has been an absolute ride.
[3:17:31] SireOfTheLake: PepegaChat
[3:17:32] warmachine89: That's less the peanut gallery and more the splash zone, judging by Malton's voice.
[3:17:36] ThePointGaming: also the server is live 24 hours, and you have people who play A TON..and having captains that can only be available for abit..suck for the captains and who it affects
[3:17:40] drreaper39: ....
[3:17:42] Danination: are the new chatters already swarming?
[3:17:42] lawlkat: the captains are crazy impressive. it took them 2.5 months to speedrun the collapse 3.0 saw 3 years to play out lol
[3:17:42] warmachine89: Madge chatters are cringe
[3:17:44] Inz4ne_: yea its huge W for rp
[3:17:46] DiaBeetusKoby: @vicious_pen 1 person caused this.. cornwood
[3:17:50] snitzzzig: The Capt are just RP corrupt, its just RP guys...

[3:18:20] lawlkat: has custard not seen the treason clip lol?
[3:18:22] RadahTatTat: @snitzzzig bro... not punishing cops for excessive force is corrupt OMEGALUL

[3:18:29] christinalee9: christinalee9 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! 
[3:18:31] TheBFG_01: @snitzzzig there is literally a server rule, blocking PD command from being corrupt
[3:18:32] SireOfTheLake: PepegaChat
[3:18:34] bakerboy404: Eugene Zuckeberg will show up
[3:18:34] skinnylegend000: ill miss cornwood being a silly little police guy.
[3:18:35] AlteredData: PepeLaugh TeaTime
[3:18:35] Semantha: I'll be sad if we don't ever get to see Cornwood as a cop again, but lets be honest, he's probably getting LASO down the line lol
[3:18:35] DrVerklompen: Wow
[3:18:36] DeadAssYeetOnEm: OMEGALUL

[3:19:20] ShugrVT: Jokes on you, Custy loves being called a good boy by chat (real)(true)
[3:19:21] Danination: should be Turner, Slacks, and Cornwood only
[3:19:22] Asmodean01: Even if Cornwood didn't call any of them, someone knew things wore going on yesterday, so they had to know Cornwood was going there. Wouldn't be shocked if it was Max himself who called others.
[3:19:22] skinnylegend000: RIP Billy

[4:04:29] RadahTatTat: @Despoiler98 ok
[4:04:38] ToxiccLadd: is he just referring to aldo and ruth?
[4:04:39] Cintr40: the problem was Ruth and her minions
[4:04:39] iHart: Aldo never works with him neither did the other senior, ruth is know to hate cornwood I kinda agree with berric
[4:04:41] dawn2005: Slacks strict???
[4:04:44] ilmarcusil: BasedGod beric

[4:05:30] hiicks_: Oh god, here comes Duncan
[4:05:30] wombo2hiitcombo: @iHart But it's good to have an outside, mostly unbaised source to look at the situation and give an opinion, no?
[4:05:37] dawn2005: I think LEO stuff should be kept in LEO company but ya know
[4:05:46] Cintr40: He want cornwood to be Polish?
[4:06:00] eri_frost: limited character witnesses
[4:06:06] LilMaGooby: He essentially started a coup against Ruth, and seems to have succeeded
[4:06:11] FastEddeh: having the shift 1 people there instead of shift 2 is a drastic difference is what I think Beric is trying to state
[4:06:23] RadahTatTat: beric... he bragged about double tapping a suspect and did sloppy police work kivaDed
[4:06:38] Cintr40: McNaulty is a NO bullshit person!

[4:08:20] misfit667: It's snowing bad here too @lt_custard
[4:08:24] FastEddeh: if that pit wasn't safe there should never be a pit in the city ever again
[4:08:28] Jackelol555: slacks doing results based analysis
[4:08:31] zorahul: in your opinion was that pit safe?

[4:09:01] hippyliam: This is the healthiest high command convo I've heard, love this communication and openness widepeepoHappyRightHeart
[4:09:05] FastEddeh: the only reason why that pit was considered unsafe was because of the result not because of procedure
[4:09:05] Honorspren: its stil dumb the brian knight thing was the final dap
[4:09:10] K1lpkonn: @laaazylemon Lenny didnt kill anyone
[4:09:16] 1CaptainRedBeard1: It was actually a great spot to pit into. Easy to get cars jammed up in that space.
[4:09:17] Gibo5385: moon2W speech
[4:09:19] yetisarentreal: @hippyliam actually agree
[4:09:21] MrHyde81: LETHIMCOOK

[4:10:05] Antonne15: First time chatter but I've become a big fan of McNulty in 4.0. This has probably been asked and answered, but would McNulty accept or turn down the Commissioner position if offered to him?
[4:10:08] RocketMcCoy: McNulty should not I wanna see  his pits
[4:10:23] TheIrishCanuck: but we werent told they could vote
[4:10:28] K1lpkonn: @laaazylemon Yes, the suspect while pitting at the allowed speed, not an innocent bystander
[4:10:39] zzzzzzz8133: I think it actually really saved cornwood in the end Alice was there
[4:10:39] SireOfTheLake: Ayo
[4:10:40] RadahTatTat: well...

[7:24:29] skinnylegend000: approving your own warrant sounds weird. 2nd set of eyes is so beneficial.
[7:24:37] RadahTatTat: this is big Saususge
[7:25:01] BigDutchBag: unsafe pit?
[7:25:09] coldskarr: didnt you give yourself one recently

[7:28:58] themanwithanrx7: Sounds like she's just managing her shift lmao
[7:29:01] DBZSnack: yeah now we see captains dont trust their officers lol
[7:29:02] Lalgil: WOW
[7:29:03] LustyHeart: @themanwithanrx7 can she do that while not on the job?
[7:29:11] TheBFG_01: I mean, sounds like she‚Äôs doing her job‚Ä¶
[7:29:15] Zhang_1888: sounds like gossip
[7:29:18] its_R4HUL: Cop stacking in mrpd KEKW
[7:29:25] RadahTatTat: @DBZSnack oh you sweet summer child... AAAA
[7:29:26] LogicWeasel: guys, it's not ok for Ruth to be IN a PD vehicle while OFF DUTY
[7:29:29] OkaAnt_: @themanwithanrx7 being off duty and stalking officers is 1000% not part of her job
[7:29:30] warmachine89: "Why is it whenever something comes up, it's always those three..."
[7:29:37] cytogeni: @themanwithanrx7 following officers without the tracker on stealing a police PD and stalking them is her job?
[7:29:41] MadChemistTHC: stalk is a strong word
[7:29:50] magnets_: "well i must have been fucking up big time then"
[7:29:56] Nightbot: Come join the discord and fill up the ranks! https://discord.gg/PMrxK3F
[7:29:56] Lucsvm: GIGACHAD
[7:30:03] OkaAnt_: she was in full gear off duty and thats wild
[7:30:03] RadahTatTat: using "stalking" is wiiiild
[7:30:06] Despoiler98: could this be MORE of a targeted witch hunt? What does Max have against Ruth?
[7:30:11] maggsrags: Don‚Äôt blips sometime not show up?
[7:30:23] themanwithanrx7: christ relax hoppers
[7:30:36] chasezetar: it was addressed last night with the captains they just don‚Äôt know it
[7:30:44] Killsauce: and cornwood and den probably had by far the most daps at the time
[7:30:44] TheBFG_01: how can she be incognito if she‚Äôs in a cop car?
[7:30:45] DBZSnack: running her shift not signed in lmao
[7:31:00] RadahTatTat: the self-victimization machine goes brrrrrr AAAA
[7:31:14] OkaAnt_: @TheBFG_01 when your on duty theres a tracker and she went offline so the tracker aint show up
[7:31:16] advancedwolverine: @TheBFG_01 off duty so they dont show up on the map
[7:31:17] Evezh_: @TheBFG_01 off duty so no radar blip
[7:31:17] jhazlett37: @thebfg_01 she was off duty
[7:31:45] laaazylemon: he was
[7:31:48] chasezetar: shift 1
[7:31:49] ggminus: being afraid might make you more prone to make mistakes
[7:31:49] vinnythevman: @thebfg_01 she turned her gps ping off so when cornwood checked the map she didn't show up even tho she was in front of him
[7:31:50] Killsauce: has to be shift 1
[7:31:54] JC9R_: 1
[7:31:55] Cultivated: He's 1
[7:31:55] OkaAnt_: late 1 early 2
[7:31:56] TheBFG_01: @advancedwolverine I get that, but a cop car is very noticeable, regardless of whether they‚Äôre on or off duty
[7:32:00] randybobndyphone: Shft1
[7:32:04] ITZxJeff: 1\
[7:32:05] Kevin_D_Gate: Hmm
[7:32:06] zeldaspirit: He was shift 1 he moved to 2
[7:32:10] Lucsvm: was 1
[7:32:12] Despoiler98: @OkaAnt_ spot checking officers without announcement is a completely normal procedure for superiors to do in MANY jobs not just LEO, showing up unannounced is how you catch people misbehaving
[7:32:13] its_R4HUL: 1
[7:32:15] 1ivoni: McNut promotion inbound?
[7:32:20] Cultivated: @zeldaspirit No he never moved to 2
[7:32:21] Killsauce: yeaa because he wants to move to 2 thats right
[7:32:26] advancedwolverine: @TheBFG_01 the intention was clearly to be hidden lol
[7:32:27] chasezetar: 1 moving to 2
[7:33:00] RadahTatTat: so... all of his DAPs should've come from Ruth AAAA he was shift 1
[7:33:03] OkaAnt_: @Despoiler98 even so being off duty in a marked car and in full gear would get anyone one else daped
[7:33:27] RadahTatTat: @OkaAnt_ not if you run the shift KEKW she's HC
[7:33:28] HallJams: why would other captains issue daps outside of their shift
[7:33:42] TheBFG_01: @advancedwolverine I mean, if she really wanted to be hidden, she‚Äôd be in a local car.
[7:33:43] Despoiler98: @vinnythevman yeah, how else is a superior going to catch someone on a job doing something they arent supposed to, normal supervisor operation, check up on your crew without telling them
[7:33:46] OkaAnt_: @RadahTatTat captains arent above there procedures
[7:34:02] OkaAnt_: they have to follow the same rules everyone else has to
[7:34:09] CuBanMumzy: DAPS again?
[7:34:20] NoT2BaDTV: @radahtattat so she's above the rules that she enforces?
[7:34:22] HallJams: this "investigation" seems weird
[7:34:27] warmachine89: @CuBanMumzy I KNOW RIGHT?! It's so fucking tedious.
[7:34:32] biboirl: there are no procedures for this she is a captain of ALL shifts
[7:34:34] Lucsvm: @CuBanMumzy is always daps man PepeWhy
[7:34:36] kavcav: @OkaAnt_ Ehh, someone has to have the authority to make exceptions to rules, and that would be captains in this case
[7:34:36] OkaAnt_: @Despoiler98 idk mabye hiring a pi or doing a investigation not stalking
[7:34:39] babyface6745: sharkieHi sharkieLurk

[7:34:45] FoxOnTheWall: ruth?
[7:34:59] Despoiler98: This is an OOC Mechanic issue not an iC issue she HAD to go off duty to stop the tracker to be able to spot check her officers
[7:34:59] Bi0_: Always daps and always the same like 4 people coming up.
[7:35:06] RadahTatTat: the ruth hat is wild KEKW turner's much more harsh y'all just haven't seen it yet lol
[7:35:28] FoxOnTheWall: @RadahTatTat they both suck imo lmao

[7:35:49] Despoiler98: wow could this guy be MORE Telegraphing his bias
[7:35:50] bakerboy404: Turner acts with reason, plus he likes trains
[7:35:51] Lucsvm: LELKEKW
[7:35:52] Smokay17: Ruth is just more vocal and direct, where Turner likes to do 1 on 1
[7:35:53] FoxOnTheWall: @MrHyde81 what....
[7:35:57] Wipe_btw: @Bi0_ it's almost like they might be targeted and it should be investigated?
[7:36:08] FoxOnTheWall: @RadahTatTat what...?
[7:36:09] CuBanMumzy: PD needs turner for sure to stop the fuckery
[7:36:18] Bi0_: @Wipe_btw or they're just fucking up.  xD

[7:38:52] HallJams: off duty or signed out
[7:38:52] xflukesx: Cornwood got fired ??? BibleThump
[7:39:01] themanwithanrx7: no
[7:39:07] OkaAnt_: @xflukesx was gonna but dab saved him
[7:39:10] ggminus: @HallJams same thing, no?
[7:39:17] neptunesstorms: BASED
[7:39:28] Bi0_: @xflukesx no mayor pulled rank to overrule ruth's vote, he's down to ppo and starts back tomorrow.
[7:39:39] RadahTatTat: @OkaAnt_ tell me, crane said it wasn't treason and max agreed so... KEKW
[7:39:39] Despoiler98: getting dapped for straight up murder yeah
[7:39:40] HallJams: @ggminus people do paper work not signed in
[7:40:04] ggminus: @HallJams she was following, not doing paperwork
[7:40:13] LustyHeart: @Despoiler98 autopsy didnt say so, so where are the other 7 ppl who shot him too.
[7:40:14] Bi0_: I actually really agree with the 3 level thing. (not that it matters)
[7:40:22] OkaAnt_: @RadahTatTat he was being the middle man tryiog to save the situation she literally said we can just overthrow the council
[7:40:26] HallJams: if it's in the purview of her duties who cares if she's signed in
[7:40:32] Killsauce: yea theyve moved very close to that right

[7:57:45] danishzombiex: ltcustHappyCustard
[7:58:37] warmachine89: @YammersTV I know precisely what he meant, but good leaders are not always good teachers, and having a requirement like that risks keeping a level-headed leader on the bench.
