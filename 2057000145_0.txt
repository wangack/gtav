[1:03:11] Diggy_waffle: for rp
[1:03:25] IamthaKingslayer: does that mean the prison is gonna get an update for something to do in it there's not even doc for hold until trial lol
[1:03:28] Rubixc1999: someone permaing should be taken seriously but this nah
[1:03:29] Mic_Stargazer: Like it seems like It's not to stop normal crim activities but borderline griefing
[1:03:38] alienslx: Looks like it's a hardpush for people who have progression. Because they dont need to attack businesses to do crime
[1:03:51] Rubixc1999: we need doc and lifers to bring life back to prison
[1:03:56] fugz2: or gov should start compensating when found not guilty and not just 50k ... but something like what they are asking 100K +
[1:04:23] themrc99: So...up good dee arc?
[1:04:26] lordofspin: does it only apply after 3 or more times?
[1:04:27] agentofchaoso7: i guess they didn’t learn from what happened with sanguine.  look what happened last time they put everyone in for 30-60 days. just my opinion though
[1:04:28] Mic_Stargazer: They even called it the "ego" act, like the intent seems clear but hopefully it doesn't apply to g6
[1:05:07] Bacon_Space: Did croc care for the ego act law?
[1:05:14] ReinBork: "Targeting Act"
[1:05:18] IamthaKingslayer: the thing i wish they would change is they hold people till trial then at trial found not guilty and dont receive anything back for all the days wasted waiting on trial
[1:05:33] kaisnipplez: I dont exactly see how robbing a business entity repeatedly has anything to do with ego

[1:08:51] Krisgadgets: i Would Speak to an Adm1n  to Clarify  because it Dont Make Sence to have G6 as Robbable and then Limit it if thats the Case

[1:08:58] skutza: dukes for the drunken roo Prayge
[1:09:04] Arakanans: Feels like they really want people to use the in game systems to do crimes and leave civs alone or something.

[1:09:28] Kr4zYm0f0: @Krisgadgets it might be something to combat against people like jean paul as well

[2:30:12] jomrann12: moon is cheese
[2:30:16] fugz2: They are taking every element registered via the Big bang via the mass loop
[2:30:20] lolagin: It doesn't matter, combinations of subatomic particles are universal
[2:30:21] Daavko: physics buddy
[2:30:22] qattro___: The moon is a chees... facepalm
[2:30:27] Thejutsanator: the moon is made of cheddar
[2:30:27] alienslx: No, because there are a certain number of electrons, protons, and neutrons that makes up elements.
[2:30:27] Soundless8975: @jomrann12 the moon is ricotta
[2:30:29] MJT_au: They leave spaces for the ones they haven't found yet
[2:30:32] TwoOfSpadess: GO FASTER

[2:31:10] Lunar_Delta: Im a physics major but theres so many levels to the questions youre asking AAAA
[2:31:24] sao_mito: The moon and earth crashed into each other billions of years ago and everything that's on the moon is on earth
[2:31:42] b0mber2001: Monster Napped Chip
[2:31:47] Valroz: Every element has an atomic number which corrolates to the number of protons in the element so they can count the atoms and figure out what number it is on the table
[2:31:47] b0mber2001: Lol
[2:31:54] Fynale: that eating animation

[3:56:53] Mic_Stargazer: its worth getting an actual clarification on EGO from like a judge tbh it just sucks its so vague
[3:56:57] DrunkenZergling: Juniors back?!
[3:56:59] fugz2: gonna have to mask up
[3:57:04] Sigfred42: Well its 3 times in a 30 day period
[3:57:09] thylootgoblin: EGO shouldnt apply to g6 honestly
[3:57:47] fugz2: lol dundee getting EGO charges for sure. XD
[3:57:48] sao_mito: so self snitching on G6 still going to happen?

[4:00:08] DOWNBAD_ELLY: Get upgood NODDERS

[4:00:11] giga_mex: TRUCKING!
[4:00:12] coliinn: chaos doesnt work in this city
[4:00:12] lordofspin: you need a smart grinder in the crew
[4:00:12] rcmartinez2441: Chaos needs funds too
[4:00:16] skutza: chaos can wait
[4:00:20] sao_mito: need funds
[4:00:28] Zairichii: I think the chaos will still come while you guys are doing what you need
[4:00:30] Aerogwin: whipSad whipSad whipSad

[4:00:48] skutza: chaos needs funds , crime needs funds to do crime - gotta lock it in.
[4:00:49] saturnbiscuits: chaos comes naturally, it will happen as you guys do what you need !
[4:00:55] fuzionender19: so offline Grinding?
[4:00:57] Nomad_Ninja: 15
[4:00:57] themrc99: I'd love a real up good dundee arc

[4:01:17] skutza: peepoLeave KEKW
[4:01:18] shacklyn: 3 is a magic number
[4:01:20] m0rtified: Classic whippy
[4:01:21] Mic_Stargazer: Yeah I think the reluctance to bring people on kind of puts you behind, the city pretty much requires semi-organized groups to function
[4:01:24] Daelaron86: FeelsDankMan 21 fingies
[4:01:25] Nomad_Ninja: this is why you count the rows, then multiply by 3
[4:01:30] yolfiic: what if a place appears in vespucci
[4:01:32] sao_mito: peepoLeave
[4:01:38] thylootgoblin: grove st 10 best value

[4:01:55] skutza: a year no ? KEKW
[4:01:59] VacantNobody: Different world then thoguh
[4:02:02] Mic_Stargazer: No its fair I was just explaining why i think its this way, i like the RP still i just feel bad because OOC you really want to progress or at least keep up NODDERS
[4:02:03] sao_mito: 7 months
[4:02:04] glitteringsnowfox: in the long term though, if you invite people that don’t work it will fall apart again down the line
[4:02:06] Aerogwin: I love that you dress by your name, such a bad ass
[4:02:12] themrc99: At the same time probably the groups that are way too far ahead are "old" groups
[4:02:19] Bigcountry182: Yeah but hangies aren't members... they're wallets NODDERS
[4:02:21] Mic_Stargazer: trueee
[4:02:23] fadebruhhh: Different world, Same people
[4:02:28] OpyPhupapy: But pyramid scheme of hangarounds is profitable
[4:02:28] skutza: also IC it makes sense for Dunde to be VERY picky, he got overthrown etc
[4:02:33] xoduh: That 7 random's to get 10k each is such a terrible plan
[4:02:35] Zairichii: It's gonna be great take ur time
[4:02:56] k00lkool: poor bbmc
[4:02:57] Daelaron86: getting good associates will probably help with a smol group
[4:03:00] Zairichii: Already claiming Junior lol
[4:03:09] VacantNobody: +1 more that you trust IMO
[4:03:13] General_jainobi: it is very hard when you have 3/4 hours to work with someone tbh
[4:03:23] xoduh: rock bottom boys!
[4:03:24] themrc99: @whippy just remember we are here for u and ur roleplay whipLove whipLove....so just send it
[4:03:29] DOWNBAD_ELLY: NODDERS
[4:03:29] NoranorTV: We are starting from scratch... Like lmao
[4:03:30] fugz2: I love bogan dundee but things are different in this city laws are changing and so is the whole environment civ jobs crime and everything ... but as a viewer its hard to comment on any actual change to char like you asked.  XD
[4:03:43] OpyPhupapy: You need 12+ with this game mechanics to grind for missions
[4:03:47] NoranorTV: We are on hard mode, it's fun
[4:03:48] DOWNBAD_ELLY: Its also not that no one wants to join. Dee is very picky.
[4:03:50] Oscar_Herodo: i think you dont play on hardmode, but on extreme hard mode with all the restrictions
[4:03:56] alienslx: Just become mayor. Mayor probably has prio
[4:03:58] xoduh: Captain underpants boys! whipNYOOOM
[4:04:00] skutza: it also makes sense for dundee to take his time from what's happened to him in the past
[4:04:04] sao_mito: people also saying bbmc is a is a bang boys 2.0 blah blah
[4:04:12] coliinn: @Oscar_Herodo he does
[4:04:23] xoduh: lick lick lick
[4:04:42] DOWNBAD_ELLY: @sao_mito I see BBS 2.0 as a compliment tbh. I loved BBS FeelsStrongMan
[4:04:55] BloomOnline: I could quit my job to RP but then homeless RP wouldn't be RP anymore
[4:05:20] xoduh: Sadge
[4:05:24] davidayotte: tbh whippy is right.. you need good people around you.. but it’s hard when Dundee burns bridges everywhere he goes…that’s why I love the this character
[4:05:28] Mic_Stargazer: I think once you get past money issue you can be the guys buying jewelry to run and thetn its just a smoother cruise from there
[4:05:44] davidayotte: I hope so
[4:05:45] skutza: dundee has a lot of support more than not imo
[4:05:45] General_jainobi: the thing is that we are here for whippy/dundee I'm sure it will work out in the end so what if it's slow at progressing
[4:05:48] DOWNBAD_ELLY: Dee has gotten better with the burning bridges thing tbh
[4:06:02] itsDaniBear: Nah, this Dundee has some really good connections
[4:06:03] xoduh: Story old as time
[4:06:04] skutza: jack 100% deserved getting stabbed imo
[4:06:06] NamelessRumia: yeah, it's a bit exaggerated

[4:08:10] Fossabot:  Advice, help, suggestions, or anything else of that nature, keep to yourself. That's back-seating. He is playing his own character and needs to do what he wants without chat influence, unless specifically asked for.

[4:10:36] sao_mito: you need to grind to be able to do chaos
[4:10:40] yolfiic: CHAOS CAN BE more CHAOTIC w money but up to u

[4:11:12] glitteringsnowfox: yeah you can’t do proper chaos without having money and assets, especially since guns are becoming a thing again
[4:11:16] CraveR_97: I don’t understand how up good arc is no role play there will be plenty
[4:11:25] Mic_Stargazer: THe stash house stuff is so cool
[4:11:26] AlbatrossBlue: I get dundee thinking jacks just asks kelly to do things but has done nothing for him....but same time its his mate and was out of left field lol

[4:12:49] Nomad_Ninja: its not cooking...

[4:12:58] Nomad_Ninja: how can you cook, without power?
[4:13:04] nl_f0x: someday I want to count how many times strimmer says the f word per stream think it would be hilarious

[4:13:23] AlbatrossBlue: @skutza tbo bbmc being so small is the prob...you know them groups are doing the same as dundee at times
[4:13:37] General_jainobi: it will work out in the end I have no doubt whippy will get there in the end honestly
[4:14:02] coolboarder5: Also rule of 6 as well
[4:14:05] KingLiven27: Too many cooks in the kitchen spoil the broth
[4:14:09] fuzionender19: even if the admc?
[4:14:11] nummento: Dundee needs the tightest knit group ever
[4:14:11] Mic_Stargazer: they dont have to be actual official members to work with you though do they?
[4:14:16] ImJustAsBad: and 3.0 it happened
[4:14:28] rcmartinez2441: what if I said: "mimemamomu mimemamomu mimemammomu"?

[4:15:49] caramelisedmonkey: you need a steady income that's all then chaos should be easy
[4:15:55] ImJustAsBad: Whippy, the amount of experience you have in this server is crazy good.  You can probably see that info
