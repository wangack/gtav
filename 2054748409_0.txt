[1:05:10] RyneNolen01: Yawn
[1:05:17] jaycedace00: Is Turf not moving cos your not pushing the strain
[1:05:20] animated_rain: click the right colors in the correct order
[1:05:23] ThomasTooDank: I havent had a haircut in like 7 months, been lazy af
[1:05:28] vewybig: ming should play candy crush to practice connecting colors
[1:05:43] reagon_plays: check turf rep
[1:05:46] zvidrvhim: 100% more than the other strain pushing there
[1:05:47] khadka9860: bull shit
[1:05:48] eggnoyolk: control
[1:05:48] BlastedRoyal: the strain rep on turf
[1:05:50] dkakr: its relative volume pushed
[1:05:53] CopperKat: the evidence so far points to that being volume of weed pushed - not a tug of a war between strains
[1:05:55] AdanTheEpiphany: and does it matter
[1:05:56] Shadow_O11O: maybe competition
[1:05:56] fornik8r: is it 100% of turf weed sales?
[1:05:56] AbbottJake: Barret 50 cali by the way
[1:05:57] swankytiger942221: I think it starts at 100 and if other strain is pushed there it goes down.
[1:05:58] ind_i_go: how much of the weed is on turf?
[1:05:59] khadka9860: u dont know until u leave vagos turf
[1:06:00] AbbottJake: what a name
[1:06:00] muskin6: Quality of weed ?
[1:06:02] zasbu: @mako__o
[1:06:02] AdanTheEpiphany: cause dont seem like it
[1:06:05] fublian: 100% is how much thee group that have sold most on the turf have sold. Then your % is how much % of that you have sold
[1:06:07] 1evilshark: maybe master growers. you got 2
[1:06:08] walzih: maybe combined seller rep?
[1:06:08] Sparcle_: he's colorblind guys stop bullying ming
[1:06:10] marubo0422: Find out in rp ok
[1:06:13] hemmorj: the contest between strains ?
[1:06:15] zenwas0: relative maybe?
[1:06:19] CIoneattack: lebronJAM
[1:06:20] iiidaaah: think 100% is just the one who sold the most, like if u sold 50 your 100, someone who sold 25 would then be 50%
[1:06:20] hemmorj: one strain rules = 100
[1:06:22] RyneNolen01: fanfJAM
[1:06:27] cxnt: hi
[1:06:30] fublian: So if Group A sold 1000  and Groub B 100 then it would 100% and 10%
[1:06:30] AyoMIXES: champagne papiiii
[1:06:32] soccersurfer: the volume the strain pushed
[1:06:38] Apollon_XXI: maybe popularity of the strain so that more customers come
[1:06:42] Torakko8: fanfJAM
[1:06:43] JetSpeedz: Drake
[1:06:49] coomiehilfiger: anita max
[1:06:53] dkakr: yeah
[1:06:54] fornik8r: i guess it can't be total weed sales if there is one strain at 100 and another at some other percentage.  doesn't make sense
[1:06:55] anitamaxwynn0: yes
[1:06:59] hemmorj: @fublian or 90 10 split on the same block
[1:06:59] animated_rain: Dentge

[1:07:12] prmanu: add WHAT emote
[1:07:16] masterladyfapper: LUL
[1:07:19] reagon_plays: single strain turfs all have 100%
[1:07:28] iamloff: if its the volume then vagos' turf wouldnt have 17% on the first day no ? they would start on 100% right away ?
[1:07:31] swankytiger942221: You start at 100 and if another strain starts to push then yours goes down and there's goes up
[1:07:34] ahemh: Probably continues to count after 100
[1:07:35] dkakr: basically zaza is pushed half as much as scooby doobie
[1:07:35] nearblindlight: yea
[1:07:38] ComfyAura: yeah like turf control
[1:07:43] Torakko8: That would have made more sense
[1:07:45] ZerZom: they go down only if they push more than thm
[1:07:46] zvidrvhim: The thing is fucked
[1:07:47] CopperKat: yeah but that isn't quite how it works - its not a straight tug of war. The volume pushed matters.
[1:07:47] BlastedRoyal: it does go down, zaza went down
[1:07:51] fublian: Yeah, 100% is confusing. it should be a number instead. But I guess they do not wanna leak how much they sold exactly
[1:07:53] hemmorj: yuh rn it doesnt add up
[1:07:53] Smitt66: Is there a benefit for multiple strains? or is this what hes trying to figure out?
[1:07:55] Tatsuchew: like king of the hill
[1:07:58] WeebRemover: it's probably fked
[1:08:02] zvidrvhim: You can't even see certain turfs on it lol
[1:08:02] amanidiot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yk5_5bFWGno&ab_channel=TwitchClips
[1:08:03] edison2000: Idk, probably made like this because they don`t want only 7 groups to do this shit
[1:08:04] reagon_plays: no they need to push at least the amount others have pushed then other would start going down
[1:08:05] vewybig: yah that would make it where you can push another group offline
[1:08:09] StreamElements: If you're liking the stream, consider subscribing and supporting Ming! Or, if you want to get real crazy, you can gift subs as well! https://www.twitch.tv/subs/Ming
[1:08:10] swankytiger942221: Maybe talk to speedy since he pushes somewhere that thats happening at??
[1:08:25] CopperKat: if youve pushed double the amount of another strain, it takes them way longer to bring down your % - whereas its easier for you to tank their %
[1:08:28] swankytiger942221: Or someone who pushes there
[1:08:30] boosterronny: this way you can still have multiple strains on a turf I guess
[1:08:34] muskin6: I think its quantity basis
[1:08:39] fornik8r: maybe there is a threshold, you need to sell to reach 100%?

[1:08:50] JetSpeedz: lebronJAM
[1:08:53] civy__: lebronJAM
[1:08:54] MrStaffyMan420: Maybe it's the rep of the strain, more you push more it goes up each strain is indapend
[1:08:55] alexeignis: lebronJAM

[1:09:52] edison2000: Bit crazy how nobody tried to fuck with Vagos turf xdd
[1:09:59] hemmorj: @itsExclusive_ZA nah they share the strain anyway

[1:10:42] MrStaffyMan420: Could the percentage bar not just indicate the rep of each strain

[9:31:38] iKickMyself: feel like AK shouldve been here for this
[9:31:40] keikobeans: i dont see any problem with multiple apps, nothing on the app mentioning group names anyways
[9:31:40] rajadre: futures group isnt big right? you can have future's group on the same app as the random ppl, so you can kick the other half later on
[9:31:40] bjerre6969: giving 10 dealers a taste of the good weed money and then taking it away from them in an instant is a dumb idea
[9:31:40] ahemh: @xx_josh0_xx literally said he didn't
[9:31:45] swankytiger942221: Because rhead can't do it himself mrbongLUL mrbongLUL
[9:31:52] swankytiger942221: 4head
[9:32:02] benmaui: I think 4head is right on this one, you guys are going to need more people eventually for turf related bidness
[9:32:03] ahemh: Future runs g6 he'll be fine
[9:32:05] muskin6: This could be done in one app put some trusted and put some randoms too
[9:32:22] NebelKop: i dont think its smart to treat weed pushers like they are your "gang"...
[9:32:28] xx_josh0_xx: @ahemh he said that but he said he'd make money so....
[9:32:31] Pheyerus: Has anyone actually figured out what happens when multiple people own a turf and are selling? Seems like customers buy everyone
[9:32:34] vewybig: i dont think any of the ideas will work
[9:32:36] ana2782617: cant there be half the people trustworthy and half randoms?
[9:32:44] hemmorj: julian is on top of things he working hard GIGACHAD
[9:32:47] svan223: if the turf gonna be little seoul gonna need more people for sure to hold that down
[9:32:56] zvidrvhim: Make 2 more hq app and you can also potentially sell the existing one to vagos
[9:33:15] Congiii: Merica!
[9:33:15] DeeKoiii: MERICA'
[9:33:18] Ginguhr: KKonaW YEEEEEEE
[9:33:19] kenjistrong: why a American flag
[9:33:21] Spondooley: wouldn‚Äôt the randoms just get robbed by the other groups already selling there?
[9:33:21] iKickMyself: do vagos even have an app? maybe their views on stuff has changed too
[9:33:22] hemmorj: KKona HELL YEAHH BROTHER
[9:33:27] ReAsriel: KKonaW HOLY
[9:33:29] kenjistrong: most people in the house aren‚Äôt American
[9:33:30] harry_70: I think 4head just wants to make a gang
[9:33:40] rayantrex: this rp gonna go crazy
[9:33:45] ReAsriel: @harry_70 Basically
[9:33:50] NebelKop: @Spondooley so? they already paid for the weed...
[9:34:00] onehandshow: Its the best country wdym @kenjistrong  KKonaW
[9:34:01] Chriss332211: if you holding turn your a gang there isnt anyother way to it

[9:34:15] Chriss332211: so people saying they dont want to be a gang then dont have turf
[9:34:15] drewcif9876: yeah should sell current computer to vagos. going to go to waste otherwise when you guys move out
[9:34:19] Churro408: is this the stx buffalo
[9:34:19] ValuableBoring: 4head is literally making gg 2.0 LMFAO

[9:34:43] SkipiMeowtastic: you need one more grower for sure
[9:34:44] ppanda0_0: eventually you‚Äôll need numbers to hold down shit later on
[9:34:45] swankytiger942221: This comes down to 4head wants a gang to do thisnshit and ming wants bums
[9:34:46] onehandshow: Just do it fuck the low iq bozos PepeLa
[9:34:47] muskin6: Both of the idea can be done in one app put some trusted and put some randoms too
[9:34:49] DeeKoiii: Ope
[9:34:51] bjerre6969: then isn't dhead the only one who gets money in the group?
[9:34:51] purpleSCREAM: same people same gang gg 2.0 ResidentSleeper

[9:35:09] Evolution2014: Do it MEGALUL
[9:35:12] ValuableBoring: I think 4heads rp doesn't go past southside gang rp ming
[9:35:17] xx_josh0_xx: if you can buy turf all you need todo is buy one spam sell to make a profit and if there's problems buy another and repeat
[9:35:19] ComfyAura: mhm GIGACHAD
[9:35:20] Wfbigb93: yeah that will be best

[9:35:24] walzih: wouldnt it be better just to buy turf up north
[9:35:30] g33j4y: up north
[9:35:31] ppanda0_0: you‚Äôll need 10 butcoin and all the apps first
[9:35:31] swankytiger942221: @ming that's what you should do
[9:35:37] prestigepenguin898: send it and it will pan out
[9:35:39] Zhachi1250: Wouldnt you need double the racks then or dropped the vagos one completely
[9:35:39] ReAsriel: Maybe HQ gonna let you sell better shi for more rep = more money ?
[9:35:42] prestigepenguin898: pretty good plan
[9:35:42] keikobeans: when you say random, like people you havent met before?
[9:35:43] Youmotherflower: sneaky popo
[9:35:45] kenjistrong: who knows one of those randoms could be a gem like Turk
[9:35:54] ppanda0_0: it would takes weeks with 1 pc to get enough for all apps
[9:36:07] g33j4y: this is a good convo to have with tuggz

[9:36:50] hemmorj: mingOrange
[9:36:53] cup____: I didn't even see it
[9:36:54] Sl33pyJinn: @jasongembright the grower has to be in the app in order to get the strain
[9:37:02] ChillTyme: @jasongembright yea if youre in the app the special seeds you buy from weed guy will grow the strain
[9:37:10] ppanda0_0: @ghutta even the besties don‚Äôt have enough. the usb is 50 butc
[9:37:12] swankytiger942221: He doesn't even know if you can mrbongLUL mrbongLUL
[9:37:14] NebelKop: Its also soo much better for Rp to make it with randos
[9:37:14] tarwe: Dont they fuck over the vagos if they just change turf
[9:37:14] Juicewisdom: axeumBlush
[9:37:15] Unelll: there are 12 slots you can add trusted people and randoms
[9:37:30] ghutta: @ppanda0_0 usb is for a different thing
[9:37:34] rayantrex: @valuableboring i mean he‚Äôs not wrong in a few months lotta crews and turfs gonna get contested
[9:37:39] smythdog1: also can't you just sell them NDK and have them push that? don't even need a new strain
[9:37:41] ChillTyme: 12 slots meant to add a whole gang or something
[9:37:57] keikobeans: 10k
[9:38:15] harucanne: That makes it easy no, you just can move it
[9:38:21] Congiii: Dhead spitting
[9:38:27] keikobeans: so when are vagos gonna get their own app?
[9:38:35] onehandshow: ....
[9:38:40] hemmorj: wut
[9:38:44] Zhachi1250: or since you're head of the current, couldnt Fanny have the new in her name?
[9:38:46] muskin6: Change turf and add randoms that will be good
[9:39:08] lmaoooooo0oo: ask them 10k for you to leave EZ
[9:39:27] mandypyro: so u can do both ideas no
[9:39:31] Sl33pyJinn: can't they just sell them the hard drive with the HQ app tho ?
[9:39:37] ahemh: Weed guy also gives rep, u gotta think long term on 1 turf
[9:39:44] zvidrvhim: Thats the reason why your current hdd is valuable to the vagos cuz their rep is tied to it too
[9:39:45] rayantrex: it‚Äôs Time MEGALUL mrbongMrMing
[9:39:47] swankytiger942221: When your turf rep is 10rep it doesn't matter mrbongLUL mrbongLUL
[9:40:11] ChillTyme: vagos currently nothing to be feared anyway tbh, just that it'll ruin relations maybe
[9:40:35] keikobeans: better move quick LMFAO
[9:40:48] Sl33pyJinn: omE
[9:40:54] ahemh: LS would be good for this group and experiment with randoms somewhere else
[9:41:06] swepzyy: hell get robbed in 2 secs
[9:41:08] harucanne: So if you guys wanna move, need to do it asap?
[9:41:17] onix146: ZvidRvhim that's why the partnership is good, they both gain whatever 100 rep gains, losing or moving into other turf will fuck their progress
[9:41:18] ChillTyme: little seoul's biggest issue is cops all the damn time
[9:41:21] killing4pleasure: 4head always breaking the door
[9:41:49] ahemh: Plenty of good spots there
[9:41:50] harucanne: More rp too
[9:41:51] NebelKop: Randoms are defn. the move... yall would make way much money of them.
[9:41:59] killing4pleasure: little seoul has alot of good spots tucked away to sell
[9:42:18] JPkyy: doesnt cyprus have multiple strains? cant you just ask them ?
[9:42:22] Celascion: that's why starting a new HQ app right now might be the move mhm
[9:42:35] ChillTyme: @killing4pleasure let's see, i haven't yet seen anyone's stream selling there
[9:42:41] onehandshow: 4head involved, gonna turn it into a money sink peepoBurnMoney
[9:42:45] keikobeans: keep bella on the app and everything is sorted
[9:42:50] rayantrex: by that time LS gonna have 4 crews fighting LUL
[9:42:59] anitamaxwynn0: yh better move NDK
[9:43:02] CodIsAids: WideHardo
[9:43:07] soxicysheb: MEGALUL vagos pay 10k relocation fee for leaving the Bario
[9:43:08] killing4pleasure: @ChillTyme old cg compound area and the garage
[9:43:09] harucanne: AK DinkDonk
[9:43:31] ahemh: Vagos could still push in LS untill they get their own app as well
[9:44:01] ChillTyme: @killing4pleasure yea lot of g6 and grime around tho, wonder if they'll snitch
[9:44:41] hemmorj: Julian Pog
[9:44:44] zvidrvhim: 100 iq move is to set up one more pc, 2 hq apps and sell the current harddrive to vagos so they dont lose their current rep
[9:45:37] lmaoooooo0oo: @ZvidRvhim 5Head
[9:45:57] Pheyerus: 12 turfs n how many ppl play on this server? 12 gangs cant own them outright and stop game progress mechs for how many other crews the server has lol. Makes no diff to crews on same turf if 1 is at 100. Doesn‚Äôt mean 100 owned like ppl think
[9:46:14] ChillTyme: @ZvidRvhim yea company did something like that, not sure now if they still keeping turfs tho LULW
[9:46:54] onehandshow: @Pheyerus any tldr
[9:46:56] juudn: Its a scrolling issue that u cant see all the turfs
[9:46:58] Celascion: ooohh 5Head
[9:47:02] ChillTyme: @Pheyerus yea its not tug of war, 2 can be at 100%
[9:47:06] RoronoaZoro: pretty sure Julian wrong and it just shows 6 because it‚Äôs scuffed and you can‚Äôt scroll enough LUL
[9:47:14] yoseven_teen_38: ohhhhhh shit
[9:47:17] NebelKop: there is no reason to beef people for turf rn so randoms that buy more weed is the move mhm
[9:47:19] vewybig: @Pheyerus  pepegaChat
[9:47:46] baybarzzzz: pepegaChat
[9:47:58] NoLastChance: so if 2 strains are pushed both a lot can they both be 100%?
[9:48:45] ChillTyme: guys pushing on La Puerta make like 130 rolls a sale, idk for how many bags but its crazy, i think their guy has 300 rep
[9:49:01] ppanda0_0: @nolastchance no unless they both push the exact amount
[9:49:02] Celascion: @NoLastChance julian's explanation is that the 100% is the top limit
[9:49:03] joe_poop: Oh so if multiple strains can be pushed all it means one strain gets payed more than the other?
[9:49:05] ChillTyme: @NoLastChance yea, multiple can be
[9:49:18] keikobeans: @NoLastChance should be able too, because the 100%'s keep staying even tho others going up
[9:49:41] NebelKop: ?
[9:49:51] Celascion: competition should drive prices down, not higher
[9:49:52] ChillTyme: 100% = you sold to all available locals for your strain

[10:03:35] bigpune: do you even need a grower on the app?
[10:03:35] Hazetheking: its hard to see when ming and fanny have been horrible at making money all 4.0 LUL
[10:03:37] bjerre6969: that's alot of things

[10:05:13] ahemh: @meego0o holding down turf is gang turf that's obv how it's supposed to be
[10:05:13] homiebear17: does ming knows about his house unlock and what happen?  in game
[10:05:17] knockie2: I think you guys didn't explain it well enough because the hq app has more meaning to it with the robberies and stuff no?
[10:05:29] ChillTyme: 0.4 OMEGADANCEBUTFAST
[10:05:35] NoLastChance: the question is can both you and Vagos be at the same time 100% in their turf?
[10:05:35] MINPOGGERS: weSmart
[10:05:36] bjerre6969: so you need a new computer, a new turf, +20 butcoin, a new grower and 10 dealers with 100 rep, that sounds like alot of work
[10:05:37] yoseven_teen_38: @homiebear17 classic

[10:06:14] bigpune: MKeIIey but did you see the note?
[10:06:15] Celascion: no. ming's idea is to become the source of the re-up. It's fine especially if no one selling cares about rep and just want to grind the sales
[10:06:16] Sl33pyJinn: but do you sell to the people in the hq app that you'll be making ?
[10:06:17] NebelKop: 4head wanna hold down a turf for no benefits at all AINTNOWAY

[10:06:36] meego0o: @ahemh whobsaid holding down turf? 2 groups can profit  on 1 turf if its about money. every groups whos not a gang would do it
[10:06:36] swankytiger942221: The robberies might not come for a month. Fuck they don't even have guns mrbongLUL mrbongLUL mrbongLUL mrbongLUL
[10:06:48] meego0o: robbing own turf LUL LUL
[10:06:56] onehandshow: Need to pull up paint to explain this to the 4head viewers
[10:06:57] MKeIIey: @bigpune did ming see the note tho Kapp
[10:06:59] jinxedluck: You can also just not do hq and sell for 1k to benny runners right?
[10:07:00] g33j4y: you should talk to someone and have two groups sell in the same turf and battle it out ez profit
[10:07:00] Wfbigb93: mrbongLUL
[10:07:01] NebelKop: it is...

[10:07:12] heymuuni: shit would go so hard
[10:07:14] ChillTyme: @swankytiger942221 the AC guy will become the robberies guy, no?
[10:07:14] Juicewisdom: axeumBlush
[10:07:16] TwoTokensOneBlue_: once he makes the money sellin who cares
[10:07:16] Epo24: easy
[10:07:19] YeahDatsDes: yes pull up paint
[10:07:22] heymuuni: ratn0se youre getting banned
[10:07:24] muskin6: Both ideas can be done on same app add both and randoms @ming
[10:07:25] MKeIIey: @heymuuni how about we see your fursona
[10:07:29] Ivanrachev: Ming is literally giving them a place to sell and weed. If he decides he can kick them later
[10:07:29] smythdog1: FirstTimeChadder
[10:07:33] heymuuni: good boy
[10:07:35] Sl33pyJinn: I just cant understand how are the random people going to sell in the turf if they dont have the app that's all

[10:07:46] green__19: huh
[10:07:50] NoLastChance: it is simple and has no backlash. the only problem is whether you need to maintain a strain at 100%
[10:07:55] heymuuni: itz__zenith we dont talk about that.
[10:07:55] oshlimey: Urm wot
[10:07:59] MKeIIey: @ThatOilMoney Accurate statement
[10:08:03] itz__zenith: ok
[10:08:07] swankytiger942221: Chat listen he makes the app, buys the turf, gets bums on the app to sell the weed that he is selling to them. The bums hold the turf. Ming doesmt touch anything but the weed he is selling to the bums. NOT HARD TO UNDERSTAND mrbongLUL mrbongLUL mrbongLUL mrbongLUL mrbongLUL mrbongLUL
[10:08:17] heymuuni: thank you swankytiger942221
[10:08:25] ppanda0_0: 4head was probably thinking about actually holding a turf down and shit
[10:08:31] swankytiger942221: @heymuuni got you
[10:08:32] MythstaDythlexic: Its like 1+1=2 and ppl need a whiteboard to write out the math
[10:08:52] Ivanrachev: they are just weed selling puppets
[10:08:53] NebelKop: @ppanda0_0 4head like he does anything for more than 20 min... AINTNOWAY

[10:08:57] hemmorj: oooh
[10:08:59] hemmorj: true
[10:09:05] Celascion: ming is commercializing the weed sale
[10:09:09] hemmorj: @ppanda0_0 nope
[10:09:09] muskin6: Both ideas can be done on same app add both trusted and randoms u get 12 slots @ming
[10:09:13] jinxedluck: You can also just not do hq and sell for 1k to benny runners right?
[10:09:14] bjerre6969: I mean the idea is simple, but getting a new computer with the hq app with 10 people on it isn't easy or everyone would have it
[10:09:14] swankytiger942221: Your not building shit with them. HOLY FUCK. Your just selling them weed
[10:09:17] ChillTyme: you don't need a full 12
[10:09:25] ronin__wolf: I see the problem here Ming .......... there was no MsPaint session for the plan
[10:09:25] yoseven_teen_38: @muskin6 this

[10:09:43] Celascion: i think the idea would be more feasible once you do find these 100 rep fools with no allegiances NODDERS
[10:09:44] smythdog1: did you see the note from K?
[10:09:47] ppanda0_0: @wiidiis true LUL
