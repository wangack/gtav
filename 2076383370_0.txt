[2:46:49] doc_sharon: you right NODDERS
[2:46:49] CranApple_Juice: ASSUMING ITS SAFE UPON LANDING
[2:47:01] Marsbar305: Hamster needs parachute
[2:47:10] Siirika: I mean, couldn't you just put it in a hamster ball and load it into a cannon?
[2:47:12] A_Humble_Wooper: Even if it was physically fine, the poor thing would be scared silly.
[2:47:12] CranApple_Juice: like i reckon with a good spiral i could go absolute yard
[2:47:13] Kthanid: Hamster in protective gear.
[2:47:16] BionicShoulder: They're pretty light, it might not be as far as I'd think
[2:47:19] doc_sharon: is it in a hamster ball at the time?
[2:47:26] if0rg0t2remember: I have a clarifying question: do hamsters spiral well?
[2:47:28] Insaif: I'd say about as far as I could throw a hacky-sack.
[2:47:30] GregenPoof: Any new Spicy RP today?
[2:47:30] CranApple_Juice: pay stuff him down a potato cannon in a hamster ball and let that mf rip KEKW

[2:47:33] Pleasantmsp: Depends katesPlot Whats the size of the hamster? What's the weather like? Is my shoulder acting up that day
[2:47:36] The_Voices: unless it is a miniature giant space hamster that is
[2:47:42] hecktobreakfast: Uh.... same. If the hampter has a helmet and parachute, i could probably throw that thing pretty far.
[2:47:42] AshuraX13: katesSmile

[2:58:08] sharingiskaren: does Rue need to enforce herself?
[2:58:09] Kthanid: NODDERS
[2:58:11] ThomasTheDestroyer: That is the perfect example of why following RC directions is essential.
[2:58:20] doc_sharon: Madge
[2:58:21] laxwall11: Did Tom come back
[2:58:24] abblepiewit: @sharingiskaren Wade is temp Sgt at Arms, he would do it.
[2:58:32] Insaif: RC doesn't need to be on EVERY job. It's their job to coordinate the rest of the club. katesHrm

[3:02:56] Kthanid: Sounds like an impromptu command meeting.
[3:02:58] Insaif: Seemed like it was good from here. katesShrug
[3:02:59] abblepiewit: it was, and no lack in Wade or Maxx's comms IMO.
[3:03:05] doc_sharon: you literally said "Tom should not grow alone"
[3:03:14] laxwall11: I mean it was implied that she should be with him

[3:20:53] AshuraX13: This is what always happens for Maxx katesSuffer
[3:21:05] IchibaToll: He's got every reason to channel all his frustrations into action, and to use that to build, but he's still got to make it happen.
[3:21:12] laxwall11: I mean it just messed with his grow right now
[3:21:15] Pleasantmsp: This also gives Maxx a lot of growth potential too but more personal growth
[3:21:24] doc_sharon: I hope he uses this to step up, but we will see
[3:21:45] doc_sharon: katesCheer rub time!

[3:23:43] A_Humble_Wooper: Characters have messed up big time, but this is a marathon not a sprint. Still really early in the Raiders' story, and plenty of room for them to grow. NODDERS
[3:23:59] itsjustasummerjob: I loved Mason gassing up Maxx in the sewers yesterday

[3:24:22] doc_sharon: cheerOwo
[3:24:36] DirectorStephanie: Not mad, just disappointed MaxxRoll
[3:24:39] if0rg0t2remember: this is gonna sound backhanded but I mean it in the best way. But Mason is the first character from Sauce I actually like and root for. He's so good at characters that you want to fail, but I want Mason to succeed
[3:24:52] laxwall11: More like well we could have been closer friends with rue but now not really?
