[2:33:05] vincent_cross: I think there's only a certain degree to which you can even be informed though. Most of what you use to form opinion is half-truth at best
[2:33:08] Algoron1: Not even doing meta gaming in the vtuber sphere. Real dedication.
[2:33:10] imtwopie: The human brain is like, psychologically incapable of consuming soooo much information, so disconnecting from certain topics after learning the gist of it is an excellent idea fr

[3:12:12] 33kami: you're doing a job none of them wanna do though so it's great value

[3:12:37] Last_Paragon: Speedy is on vacation right? So who is pushing?
[3:12:38] martymagoo78: weed pushing is the only crew operation that makes money but no one seems to be doing that recently
[3:12:43] deimostrbl: but you manage all that money so i think you are doing great work
[3:12:43] daddysniffer2point0: @xiell octo has done over 100k clean cash
[3:12:45] RivikaGaming: i think that managing the money is generating money, maybe try making loans with the gang money idk
[3:12:46] UN1CR0N: yeah managing finances is a big job, plenty of contribution with just that tbh, everything else is just bonus
[3:12:46] Zaol: yuno doing nothing

[3:29:04] Sword_Scream: Honestly, the sewer being a place where you can actually be on the run and live off the grid and in hiding is so nice. Alternative lifestyles is hard to make work in RP worlds, but the sewer "world" is really well done.

[3:29:29] Sword_Scream: Even the rat cages are such a nice touch to be selfsustaining here.
[3:29:37] martymagoo78: feels like the most important part is to do as much testing as possible, so not worth buying ingredients so can progress quicker even if you don’t maximise profits early

[3:33:33] Sword_Scream: I have a theory that it might just be any legal job in the world above. Cause being a sewer dweller is to be an outcast, and working a "normal" job is just... not being an outcast.
[3:33:58] goose_kaiju: That's in keeping with GTA's overly pessimistic undertones
[3:34:04] roesslerm: @Sword_Scream that would make sense

[4:27:44] RenTheRock: If someone was willing to sell dirty cash for half, maybe
[4:28:01] EyeScraem: its like an hour to clean jewelry then clean the washed that comes form it
[4:28:07] ZunixHD: if you raise margins over 5 % people would just go to the vu no?
[4:28:07] common_idiot: bro they made cleaning dirty money more complicated than a NASA shuttle launch sequence LUL

[6:51:24] Xernique: 5k mats isn't bad as long as they commit to it and make it known to everyone
[6:51:24] Thebloc: im confused why they want to be in the crew at this point if they have their own
[6:51:26] Big_Ole_Yikes: @ mods sorry again about earlier, i wont chat anymore during NP. Just wanna be accepted here Sadge
[6:51:27] asathighs: 5k is not an small amount of mats

[6:51:48] jumpingdonuts: would the heist stuff not count assuming they are willing to combine the stuff for progression?
[6:51:51] Maimorii: Hmm
[6:51:56] kritacul: The potential they have and what they COULD give is a lot more than what they have. They are doing the bare min.
[6:51:58] robot_pirates: @asathighs it's not, but a guy like Teddy grows for the crew and gets 3k+ mats a day

[6:53:40] jumpingdonuts: @marinos101 i mean building rep for unlocks is still contribution. like with this whole moonshine experimentation. its not currently bringing much money compared to weed but its important for unlocking future stuff so worth the grind
[6:53:44] flame_leo18: geegaPLS
[6:53:46] tanderson119: true
[6:53:47] Scriix: just PLEASE never call yourself the accountant, i know its not 3.0 but langs track record, NOT GOOD hahah
[6:53:51] jumpingdonuts: geegaHi hi raiders
[6:53:58] oyieminator: the outcome of the heist from “marty’s” crew is to be shared with the main crew right ?  while not using the main crew resources
[6:54:07] Auteru: it was really good! :3 had loads of fun
[6:54:10] Thebloc: o7 new accountant
[6:54:12] Auteru: hope urs is going amazing !
[6:54:23] DrKarate_: its exactly what lang said too, Marty gave them gun parts and thought he was king shit of the group, and they clearly dont think that matters much
[6:54:26] Xernique: yeah commitment
[6:54:32] QuackstheRubberDuck: @oyieminator yeah but that's because of JP inclusion
[6:54:49] Suleman_aftab: i think its both
[6:54:50] Lothacin: i think the Dons are thinking 2+ years out
[6:54:51] Keegan3496: what was gigi's thoughts on what the dons said about autonomy regarding marty, oscar and larry?
[6:54:53] chocbrowniee: they should just kick marty at this point all they do is glaze yuno for doing 24/7 g6
[6:54:54] tanderson119: oooo yeah
[6:54:58] DarthRadonis: Exactly
[6:54:58] flame_leo18: BREAKDANCECAT
[6:55:02] TheonormalMBV: does gigi have any felonies?
[6:55:07] Sabasc0: @Scriix CFO for sure
[6:55:13] rollindarock: 5k mats in $35000 tbf but its more they need to join in on gang jobs
[6:55:17] jumpingdonuts: true
[6:55:22] raerae___: Is Gege still clean and a doctor?
[6:55:22] draftysnowman: is it even possible to bridge that disconnect between their values
[6:55:22] zamburg: @oyieminator once stuff gets serious JP will get to join back again anyway
[6:55:26] BuRRnz3: when marty first joined he did ask lang i think if he wanted to moves his racks into the house
[6:55:26] DarthRadonis: Gigi is clean except for running red lights KEKW
[6:55:26] Dzelle: @chocbrowniee what?
[6:55:27] Khul_Sardaukar: doesn't he have 2 houses?
[6:55:36] Battlebunnies123: how bout yuno?
[6:55:38] xscoxevox: What are your thoughts on the whole no hand holding perspective?
[6:55:44] qvbxx: yh the lines between the crews need to be more blurry the separation is hurting more than helping
[6:55:45] peepomi: sykk said ooc the same
[6:55:47] Xernique: I think the dons feel they are more focused on their side crew than the main group
[6:55:54] DarthRadonis: one is the casino right?
[6:55:54] skeletree420: Did u even take your cut yet?
[6:56:06] Khul_Sardaukar: i havent really seen much of the casino lately
[6:56:07] HDrksBV: Nodders
[6:56:23] AdLib_24: he got weird about kickbacks after the friday meeting
[6:56:24] cael_camarada: now that its easier to make money in the city, do you think the weekly paying should increase?
[6:56:24] Ninjizu: those twatts during the meeting where funny
[6:56:26] Suleman_aftab: feel like personal money has to be used at this point
[6:56:30] tanderson119: interesting
[6:56:31] martymagoo78: could sell them to the crew at a discount to help the farm
[6:56:31] xiell: yeah those 6060 could have gone to the crew for the buttcoin issue
[6:56:32] Zer0KD0: they focusing on heist progression tho with the dongals right?
[6:56:37] Xernique: Yuno gave all the sales to the crew yeah
[6:56:43] Zer0KD0: but he writes ntohing down
[6:56:50] tacostarvedbeast: Marty seems super autonomous just doesn’t do that for the benefit of the bois
[6:56:59] DarthRadonis: I wonder if what Lang and Yuno cooked up regarding the Buttcoin
[6:56:59] bonkiloni: spicy spicy and a lot to talk about next time GoldPLZ
[6:56:59] Suleman_aftab: @AdLib_24 wasnt weird, he just wanted clarification
[6:57:08] howdoesit: if he gives up the colourful usbs to the crew would that work?
[6:57:14] tanderson119: NODDERS
[6:57:19] jumpingdonuts: makes sense geegaNODDERS
[6:57:20] Jouka23: a perk
[6:57:21] bobinsson: auteruTeal chirp chirp auteruTeal i'm late
[6:57:21] kyulen742: nodd
[6:57:23] bruHoran: The thing is - if ppl are serious, they won't have to be asked to contribute. They would just do it nodd
[6:57:36] Big_Ole_Yikes: ok well sorry again, ill leave. Take care Geega & chat. Last thing i want to be is an annoyance Sadge
[6:57:44] Suleman_aftab: asking for direction is not handholding
[6:57:47] RivikaGaming: since u handle money, why not talk to lang and try to loan it for interest? so u can make some back as well
[6:57:49] jupiterhb: geegaCorpa
[6:57:50] robot_pirates: so true
[6:57:50] Keegan3496: 10000%
[6:57:56] Thebloc: direction
[6:57:58] numbertwodooky: geegaNODDERS
[6:57:58] abexxiii: @Suleman_aftab fact
[6:57:59] Keegan3496: some people just need guidance, and they're good
[6:57:59] softwaning: more communication would definetely help
[6:58:01] 1998_honda_prelude: Who brought Marty in to the Old Bois? Was it Tony?
[6:58:03] Oshiball: @Big_Ole_Yikes you don't gotta be a martyr bro, it ain't that serious
[6:58:03] xscoxevox: Yea.... that might be a issue
[6:58:04] Aynumi: But Marty literally has his own crew and is doing heist. It’s so weird.
[6:58:05] draftysnowman: YES
[6:58:07] xiell: some ppl need assurance that they can do something
[6:58:08] BeeTheCutieVR: ok Comfirm
[6:58:10] robot_pirates: some people need direction, or struggle to be assertive enough to make a decision
[6:58:15] Myst_pg: and some managers only know how to manage one of those types of people
[6:58:17] jumpingdonuts: its not handholding if they fundamentally don't understand what is expected. its why expectations no matter what should be clear and measurable
[6:58:19] Xernique: they dont really make themselves available though
[6:58:20] Tiilde: I wouldnt call it handholding. I think its mentoring is what they need.   Like when he was with Harry learning weed... He  GOT it . its in his brain.
[6:58:21] Zeratanis: CEASE CONFIRM
[6:58:25] laz_arisen: ya gotta handle different people different ways, marty will listen but needs the right guide
[6:58:26] Suleman_aftab: he want more communication on the operations and how he can be useful
[6:58:29] rnAlsation: Dude need missions.
[6:58:33] roesslerm: i think he doesnt want to overstep a line
[6:58:35] rnAlsation: *needs
[6:58:35] manjell0: wait thats so me
[6:58:36] amalicioustruth: they need direction
[6:58:41] nate921269: the hard part is they have there own heist crew so there kinda doing all the work for them selfs not the main crew
[6:58:41] Khul_Sardaukar: buddha is kinda harsh all the time
[6:58:42] Akizakiz: @Aynumi the initial ideas was so that larry and oscar can get exp doing heist since only 6 ppl can go on main heist crew
[6:58:48] roesslerm: u cannot operate an org this scale without having to handle some people directly
[6:58:51] bad_luck_luke: confirmation to dispel doubt
[6:59:01] DarthRadonis: Yea not everyone can be autonomous
[6:59:03] Xernique: @Khul_Sardaukar thats why he owned half the city in 3.0
[6:59:10] laz_arisen: ya you seem like the bridge rn between the dons and their crew
[6:59:16] Keegan3496: @Khul_Sardaukar Lang as a character had to hand hold a lot in 3.0, so he's trying to avoid that as much as possible.
[6:59:17] tacostarvedbeast: so he wants a long leash and dons think he means a short leash ?
[6:59:18] abexxiii: it'll be fun to have a mission board
[6:59:19] qvbxx: the mantra is the CREW above all ~ should be self evident with comitment
[6:59:22] Shad0w_wizard: agreed geega
[6:59:23] Tiilde: yeah and also Marty Larry and oscar dont really deal with dirty money  compared to their clean money. I think they dont want to step on toes.
[6:59:24] xLegendori: is talking about what was said at the don meeting a privacy issue?
[6:59:25] Pistol922: @Khul_Sardaukar ze plays his characters the same way back in wild and 3.0 as he gets more comfortable he'll be the exact same way with Luciano
[6:59:26] HoronXI: gigi the shadow don
[6:59:27] sensoRC: Marty is of a younger more impulsive mindset and Lang cant relate to it, so not a bad thing to bridge that gap
[6:59:29] pinkizzys: don gigi
[6:59:30] DarthRadonis: It does
[6:59:34] Keegan3496: oh yeah, conflict is amazing.
[6:59:35] Shad0w_wizard: see your such a great fit into this group frfr
[6:59:35] roesslerm: having Marty in the crew is such a great asset...
[6:59:38] seedsu: he treats you more like a don than the actual dons
[6:59:42] glumpyblacksheep: @laz_arisen She's definitely at that kind of Captain level
[6:59:45] bruHoran: KEKW
[6:59:45] terceroblue: that is the major problem in all the groups, easy to talk about others but many don't talk to each other.   and yes, makes for great drama and RP lol
[6:59:46] Sword_Scream: A little stirring is always fun
[6:59:47] jumpingdonuts: geegaNODDERS geega really is the group MVP. treasurer and mediator
[6:59:50] DarthRadonis: KEKW
[6:59:53] Suleman_aftab: theres deffo a big disconnect
[6:59:54] retrenity: i need gigi in most don's meeting
[6:59:55] draftysnowman: So much of this stuff irl is not communicating expectations and needs
[6:59:56] Khul_Sardaukar: cleooJThisIsFine
[6:59:56] pattaeto: youre the glue gigi
[6:59:57] Aynumi: @akizakiz Yeah but that does not seem to be whats happening. After the first one seems like MIA
[7:00:01] Thebloc: Gigi bout tot ake Tony's place as a don PepeLa
[7:00:01] Xernique: they just need to show commitment and spend more time with the crew
[7:00:01] tanderson119: shadow don EZ
[7:00:08] Saul_Goode: Gege babysitter for Marty & Co. lol
[7:00:11] xiell: @seedsu its cause hes scared of the actual dons and at least gigi will actually try to figure out his perspective
[7:00:21] Aynumi: @akizakiz I mean are they contributing the USBs?
[7:00:23] jumpingdonuts: geegaNODDERS
[7:00:25] PakuroSama: gee gee and Marty content so fun to watch 😭
[7:00:34] robot_pirates: a lot of the dons also have ran crews that required a lot of hands on direction, and a lot of them don't want to do that anymore

[9:03:18] Jam_Plays_Games: @goose_kaiju Yeah. Basically all these rednecks would trick out their cars so they could outrun police while smuggling moonshine during prohibition. After booze became legal again the rednecks still had those tricked out cars so they decided to start racing them, and that eventually snowballed into the creation of NASCAR in the 50's
