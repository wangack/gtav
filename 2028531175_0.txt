[3:26:39] moistbuthardbread: @EsfandTV was there a fence or a gate? if there was it would be trespassing if they bypassed measures used to keep people out.
[3:26:39] Fallinxdd: Traditionally, for criminal or civil trespass, there is some level of intent required. The trespasser must not simply accidentally cross another's land but must knowingly go onto the property without permission. Knowledge may be inferred when the owner tells the trespasser not to go on the land, when the land is fenced, or when a "no trespassing" sign is posted.

[4:00:58] guilt_: To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand WeeWee. His communication style is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics, most of the jokes will go over a typical RPer's head. There's also WeeWee's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance.

[4:01:21] warner05: To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand WeeWee. His communication style is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics, most of the jokes will go over a typical RPer's head. There's also WeeWee's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance.

[5:25:26] unanimous_night: @Piggens police procedure just needs to be adjusted to tell suspects to leave the property before the arrest (in case they refuse to leave)
[5:25:27] azmer1987: Sub section. Any subbers mhm
[5:25:30] ZooMAX_: is there a trespassing sign?
[5:25:32] juicymattison: The suspect has reason to believe he cannot be on that premises, whether he admits or not. If his point is “You don’t know if anyone owns it”, the response is simply “And you didn’t know if someone doesn’t”. He took the chance knowing it is possible someone owns it. iIt’s still trespassing.
