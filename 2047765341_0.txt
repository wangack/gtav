[3:07:09] rocket_monkey: a bit
[3:07:14] JustAGuyDrawing: @JustAGuyDrawing nah Jubei'Thos
[3:07:18] JustAGuyDrawing: yeah a bit
[3:07:21] USSJ2Iraija: ye
[3:07:21] Kiwi_Ingenuity: It's probably just in this area
[3:07:23] ScivarWarlock: Try vsync
[3:07:25] who_vxm2: eh its only a few frames
[3:07:31] Aiwoo: yea maybe the water is fucking this up
[3:07:34] SleepyHollow6: is the cooler on at all? or maybe not using it?
[3:07:38] JustAGuyDrawing: yeah that's dumb

[3:07:59] Brukov: NODDERS
[3:08:02] rocket_monkey: yeah
[3:08:05] icekat12: NODDERS
[3:08:07] MetaPariah: @JustAGuyDrawing Moonguard had a crazier barrens chat...and a realm full of ERP in Silvermoon city and that one tavern outside of the alliance castle.
[3:08:07] JustAGuyDrawing: pilNodders
[3:08:09] PavelPatzelt: NODDERS exactly
[3:08:11] TaleOfTwoWolves: YEP like the Prohibition
[3:08:12] ScivarWarlock: Is vsync only for screen testing or frame drops?
[3:08:20] ScivarWarlock: Tearing*
[3:08:33] PavelPatzelt: limits FPS
[3:08:41] WalterweightTV: so its not the end of twitch on korea soon?
[3:08:43] MetaPariah: @MetaPariah Goldshire tavern*
[3:08:43] JustAGuyDrawing: it might help maybe
[3:08:48] chivoenbicicleta: I agree
[3:08:50] TaleOfTwoWolves: I like Singapore's solution. Just chop off body parts as punishment. monkaS jk
[3:08:52] PavelPatzelt: YEP
[3:08:56] kingguvara: Yeah
[3:08:59] Kiwi_Ingenuity: Is the rest of the game stuttering, or just this area
[3:09:04] PavelPatzelt: You can try it
[3:09:10] JustAGuyDrawing: might be worth seeing if it works
[3:09:16] Aiwoo: his face was not a door
[3:09:25] chivoenbicicleta: Not forbid but regulate that's the key
[3:09:41] ScivarWarlock: Vsync won't make you reset the game
[3:09:46] TaleOfTwoWolves: But Singapore has great laws to protect citizens. Like to just OWN a car costs over $100k. they have zero traffic problems.
[3:09:47] JustAGuyDrawing: KEKW
[3:09:49] Brukov: LUL
[3:09:49] Aiwoo: singapore cuts off body parts for crimes

[3:14:57] JustAGuyDrawing: it'll help with the motion sickness
[3:14:58] tonyzeta: Hmm but didn't you turn off Vsync for motion sickness?
[3:15:12] TaleOfTwoWolves: doesn't GTA V have multiplayer game mode?
