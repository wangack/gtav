[9:24:17] Roz721: its funny compared to to like 2.0/3.0 where you needed clean people to help you out (stashes etc.)...no a crew needs like a fall guy/straight crim ready to do whatever and catch charge, so others dont lose work rep

[9:28:45] ghostface910: maybe by a heater to dry the money

[9:28:54] Avayden: Exchange
[9:28:55] CyanMig: do you just leave it out maybe
[9:29:04] run_u_fools: does the fence guy take the money?
[9:29:06] BiscuitKnight: check the bill on the work bench if it dried.
[9:29:10] shyness_1: maybe there is a job to dry it out
[9:29:11] OriginalGibsta: we need a little sniff sniff sound when you think you've found something spicy LUL

[9:30:17] LXXELIFE: leave it in the back yard and sun dry it maybe
[9:30:25] FaramirRat: WAshing and drying the dirty money is just meant to make it look circulated, you still gotta go to a store and buy something with it, or exchange money with someone or a bank, or own a business and pay it out as payroll, etc. etc.

[9:59:40] TastyKudzu: My bet is you see the strain as soon as it's planted. Because if you stumbled on someone else's plant you'd be able to tell the strain if you're a growing expert.

[11:04:25] boz0777: did the taste change too? Its not that great nowadays I feel. maybe im trippin
[11:04:28] Retrovisionsllc: @Mariissa_ yes but the fat of the matter most things everywhere in america is like that hate to say it
[11:04:54] official_jjanke: so a cow thats about to die?
[11:04:57] Mariissa_: i have no clue . something about them being the cows that cant stand anymore after being used to milk ?
[11:04:58] FinnaCrow: worked in restaurants 8 years, from fast food to resto-bars. the markup we do on food is insane
[11:05:02] opusnoctem: biggie on a outkast beat or am i dumb

[11:08:09] porkx: buddhaSus
[11:08:09] FaramirRat: Honestly unless your buying fresh ingredients and cooking it at home, your eating processed garbage in most things, even then grocery stores spray chemicals around their stores non-stop, soaks into all the produce, no washing it out, we live in age of "Cleanliness" but all kinds of cancers, viruses, and shit are on the climb, no one questions the "cleaning" products we spray all over the place, the pesticides, etc. were f'd.
[11:08:10] wardenau: @Retrovisionsllc close ur eyes and ears and keep poisoning yourself... good logic man

[12:20:51] TastyKudzu: I bet that Harry can plant all the weed, making it all scooby dooby, and let Dougie harvest it all for the rep.
[12:21:00] titans2014: gonna sell some of ur excess to dex?
[12:21:09] Notorious_Chow: So the question now is is Scooby doobie tied down to the planter or the person who harvests it?

[12:23:34] tz223: Dougie will probably have to be on the app to grow the strain would my guess
[12:23:41] TastyKudzu: Might as well swap the GPU for a basic one.

[12:23:52] Yushers: icymurd3rn0va yeah he’s streaming on ttv/nothefkheaint

[12:24:48] Alchavezz: so 300 stars was a mat bench?
[12:24:48] TeaNMuffins: @blueicetig I was going to say 2 hours but wasn't sure if that was right

[14:20:54] RagingSantas: teddy itching to plant LUL
[14:21:32] LuciferSpirt: tomorrow is going to be a good day full of meetings
[14:21:47] Terrozer: i mean this is rp, but that takes alot of trust, most people are self interested in life
[14:21:51] 19Timmy98: imagine someone like Denzel was around and worked with Teddy, i feel like Denzel would form an absolute soldiert out of this guy
[14:22:44] Terrozer: theres a reason contracts exist
[14:23:17] peanutguy__: bro that is a shit strain name wtf OMEGALUL
[14:23:20] RagingSantas: it would only take 2 days for them to level which is crazy
[14:23:26] Retrovisionsllc: @19Timmy98 teddy already is, i think veryone is not seeing that teddy is just like the crew he isnt going to tell his life story before forming a strong bond
[14:23:55] Tamzim: maybe turf stuff allow you to change stuff up
[14:24:21] mullybags: i feel like teddy is too close to this other crew though
[14:24:54] Yushers: I don’t think the weed stuff is even scratched the surface. there’s a whole another level with growing in a house that is still not available yet
[14:25:08] RagingSantas: @mullybags yeah it will be interesting to see how that dynamic plays out

[14:26:00] 19Timmy98: @Yushers yeah we are not even close if you consider how 'fast' you can reach the current point, theres prolly gonna be crazy shit down the line
[14:26:02] quote_me_if_horsen: i guess you need to stand still to sell
[14:26:02] EndZerr: Eagle eyes
[14:26:19] Yushers: yeah lang was freaking out when the cop pulled up on him
[14:26:19] izzygus333: lol yesterday was wild was too hard
[14:26:28] lyfmobile: yea
[14:26:32] lifeguard4lyfe: Just call Octo, he'll get you out
[14:26:40] ghettocow: dont you think its bigger runs?
[14:26:52] vrYasu: took octo like 2 mins to lose the cops the other day KEKW
[14:27:07] Valagore: selling is so sketch, cause you have to watch out for cops, the locals buying, and other people riding around robbing... too many factors
[14:27:27] lyfmobile: @vryasu  bro just looses cops from racing lines no tricks or jumps
[14:27:38] RagingSantas: i just can't wait to see a hemp farm from rust in NP. Imagine a basement full of planers and sprinklers LUL
[14:27:39] TropicalToucan: Arush still cant roll a J in game and smoke KEKW
[14:27:41] xprnstr_twitch: took octo 30 seconds to shake the cops for luci
[14:27:50] lifeguard4lyfe: The chances of Octo getting you out is better than Ramee getting you out of your charges lol
[14:28:08] TropicalToucan: I feel you are going to have to eventually get several groups
[14:28:14] TropicalToucan: Like a weed runners group
[14:28:15] Xernique: you need multiple apps i guess
[14:28:18] Paupor: 2 houses 2 groups?
[14:28:18] vrYasu: yeah...
[14:28:22] mysticmonkey321: i mean itll be less than 12 still right
[14:28:22] vrYasu: ^
[14:28:23] aery679: do they need to be in the group?
[14:28:24] fenixblac: 12
[14:28:28] ghettocow: second base of op
[14:28:28] Hoxter: maybe its supposed to limit it so there are na huge crimegangs?
[14:28:29] slackeeeee: remember, people like tony, octo, gigi aint going on this list
[14:28:34] Landarokz: Probably just start another 12
[14:28:35] Retrovisionsllc: same thing with gangs in 3.0 there was a limiy
[14:28:37] lyfmobile: cant people just replace one another when they are offline?
[14:28:41] naruuth: sub groups and hold multiple turfs hoooly
[14:28:45] vrYasu: Teddy is the key
[14:28:47] Paupor: You got the drug app and the heist app I guess
[14:28:53] RagingSantas: separate strain = separate turf?
[14:28:53] 19Timmy98: Family base and weed base
[14:28:55] vrYasu: teddy is the key mannn
[14:28:56] TropicalToucan: Im pretty sure you can only be in one group at a time because of State ID but yeah multiple HQs and groups
[14:28:56] Xernique: maybe a new pc and hq app is good enough
[14:29:04] rollindarock: The 10 take off from the Dons and the Dons move upto a better house?
[14:29:18] ethameta: the empire harry
[14:29:19] ghettocow: its cooked
[14:29:23] aery679: problem for another day
[14:29:25] ethameta: build the empire
[14:29:27] stimboxer: Weed is only one part of the crimes on the server. Later there will be like heist, black market, gun crafting. Not every1 need to do weed
[14:29:30] Valagore: no reason you cant push to multiple turfs too...
[14:29:35] StamaasG: 3 days to figure all that out
[14:29:36] Dark_Eyes32: it’s still brand new so who knows
[14:29:40] Retrovisionsllc: that would be too op imagine cg from 3.0 doing that it would literally be just a repeat of 3.0 where cg held everything down
[14:29:59] Retrovisionsllc: i dont think this server is going to allow that type of shit
[14:30:07] 19Timmy98: @Retrovisionsllc yeah but in 3.0 gang apps were whitelisted and not just created
[14:30:29] brooknaum: you think dougie gets in?
[14:30:47] 19Timmy98: But surely people can only be in 1 group id assume
[14:30:48] Retrovisionsllc: @19Timmy98 okay what you saying? still would be too op if they allowed that
[14:30:49] lyfmobile: @retrovisionsllc that's the thing no wl so anyone can do anything
[14:31:16] lyfmobile: u cant replace people ?
[14:31:22] 19Timmy98: @Retrovisionsllc Well it always depends on how people use it
[14:31:24] lyfmobile: when they are offline
[14:31:24] eazypzz: doesn’t it also consume 1butcoin to join?
[14:31:27] izzygus333: the whole group don’t need to be on it only weed pushers / growers
[14:31:31] brooknaum: specially if Teddy be ones a grower too.
[14:31:33] lightstormclaw: can probably list him as a weed connect down the line
[14:31:44] hannimal1: 2 separate turfs under the whole operation. one grower being dougie and one being you
[14:31:50] TropicalToucan: So this first group basically should only be growers and sellers. The next HQ should be for robbery people I guess
[14:31:50] xy02x: make 2 different groups
[14:31:50] waterhigh: maybe 1 hq only weed stuff?
[14:31:55] Retrovisionsllc: @19Timmy98 yeah and anything to prevent groups from being like cg in 3.0 because that was dumb
[14:31:57] waterhigh: @TropicalToucan +1
[14:31:58] izzygus333: ohhh fuck your right u forgot bout that
[14:32:00] StamaasG: Lang, Arash, Harry, Si, Ilya, Teddy, dougie, Luciano, Tony, Octo.
[14:32:03] izzygus333: I forgot *
[14:32:04] fenixblac: once the buy ins happen you’ll have 10, no?
[14:32:07] StamaasG: Arush
[14:32:16] wilson060: Dougie SAJ
[14:32:23] RagingSantas: si, teddy, lang, harry, arush, luciano, tony, octo, ilya, dougie, yuno, gege
[14:32:27] Dark_Eyes32: yeaaa I mean if you include Yuno and Octo you have 7 already and they don’t push or anything
[14:32:27] RagingSantas: that's the 12 already
[14:32:33] Bill_Collector: Damn 15 hours brother
[14:32:34] cary7: Shruge
[14:32:34] Pistol922: wonder if the "weed contacts" can be the pushers or if thats only for NPC's
[14:32:45] StamaasG: @ragingsantas gege doesnt do crime
[14:32:51] Valagore: gege won't need to be on there, shes clean and a doctor
[14:32:52] brooknaum: you’re gonna need shoulders too.
[14:32:53] lightstormclaw: @Dark_Eyes32 yuno pushes weed occasionally he dabbles in every crime
[14:32:53] Tamzim: unless they do a street team kind of thing but that not be as fun
[14:32:54] mysticmonkey321: what is gigi doing for the group
[14:32:57] TropicalToucan: I think people like Tony, Octo, or even Yuno dont really need to be on a group yet unless you guys unlock more
[14:33:04] Xernique: since there are no robberies yett it makes no sense to fill the app up with non-weed people
[14:33:05] lyfmobile: cant u kick someone then make em rejoin again when needed ?
[14:33:06] brooknaum: *soilders
[14:33:14] Bill_Collector: Gigi a doctor so she can patch em up off the books
[14:33:16] 19Timmy98: @mysticmonkey321 could be the clean person
[14:33:26] mysticmonkey321: i c
[14:33:27] 19Timmy98: and is a doctor yeah
[14:33:39] TropicalToucan: Well the only thing that is constant in Nopixel is change
[14:33:45] Yushers: these god damn plants need to grow so I can go to sleep
[14:34:07] IGotItFromMyMam4: need some redbull! Keepo

[14:34:41] necro1511: @yushers what time is it for you?
[14:34:46] ethameta: scooby snacks will dominate. let the others try to come for their piece, destroy them. muahahaha
[14:34:50] lightstormclaw: @Dark_Eyes32 he already said he would if needed to push he would yes KEKW
[14:35:12] lightstormclaw: though everyone knows yunos field is in hacking

[14:35:17] Dark_Eyes32: No shit, that’s dope
[14:35:49] brooknaum: speedy has Ramon and Stevie too he wants to add
[14:35:53] TropicalToucan: The HQ computer getting raided by police would be so crazy when it happens to a group
[14:35:56] Notorious_Chow: I mean we also got Yuno's computer for heist things as well
[14:36:00] 19Timmy98: @xprnstr_twitch Gigi probably doesnt need to be on it, she is planning to stay clean
[14:36:28] TropicalToucan: LULW Imagine
[14:36:32] GTH222: does harry have a house yet?
