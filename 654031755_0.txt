[1:50:57] SpiderLobster: would local hostage be a good idea, but I feel it would get abuse
[1:50:58] badazzguy: @wololojuice you are chat
[1:50:59] Disperix: !vod

[1:51:18] RezaQ8: Even if police dont charge in they could just spikestrip the hell out of you
[1:51:37] Krypt1kKhaos: it all depends on what mood the cops are in

[1:52:15] Francis5795: hostage bait? LUL
[1:52:29] DavicusTV: Spicy is just burnt out on crime in general. You can only do the same mechanic over and over and put a different spin on it so much.
[1:52:29] Rtik: @Tyler4AM But there's no good alternative unfortunately
[1:52:30] hacknslash548: it's probably some garbage energy cards that nobody uses
[1:52:42] Francis5795: never underestimate energy cards
[1:52:43] DSrlaagyoenr: I mean thats kinda a dangerous game if its hostage bait, because people that sue the cards are crims too

[1:53:30] Necro_Ex_Mortis: Guess thats why Spicy jumped the gun on trying to start cult szn.
