[0:13:30] thejimmydeacon: Just remembered have the internet, I just looked it up, can't castle if your king is in check
[0:13:41] Zilinity: I‚Äôd hate to play against you. I can tell your a knight player
[0:13:57] Zilinity: @thejimmydeacon I‚Äôve learned something
[0:14:19] ghostman16: LUL
[0:14:44] Zilinity: your knight is defending your pawn. i dont know what you‚Äôd move though
[0:14:50] NoahS116: knights on opening can be dangerous if you don‚Äôt play right. keeps your pawn structure undeveloped and can end up trapping your own king and key pieces
[0:15:28] NoahS116: you probably want to castle soon if you know what that is
[0:16:28] Zilinity: castling is when you flip the board in anger right? timmacLAUGH timmacLAUGH timmacLAUGH

[0:19:43] Zilinity: literally have a free check now
[0:19:48] Average5Head: take queen?
[0:19:55] NoahS116: nah he put his queen there to prevent you from moving your queen to his back rank
[0:20:04] Zilinity: you can take his Queen. shiiit
[0:20:18] Average5Head: easy knight lol
[0:20:19] NoahS116: but he blundered hard lol
[0:20:21] Average5Head: ggs
[0:20:43] NoahS116: yeah you‚Äôve got this in the bag
[0:20:51] Zilinity: free pawn. you can set up a check mate right now.
[0:20:58] NoahS116: now it‚Äôs just about checking him
[0:21:37] NoahS116: I would start trying to take out his tools on the diagonal
[0:22:26] NoahS116: you can protect the knight and attack his rook at the same time

[0:24:00] VirtualVoyager: queen F7
[0:24:09] Average5Head: yes with knight i think
[0:24:09] Zilinity: think a castle has to move for a mate here‚Ä¶. or Queen‚Ä¶
[0:24:13] NoahS116: you‚Äôre so close to the perfect move every time. like you‚Äôll hover it and think about it
[0:24:35] VirtualVoyager: done :)
[0:24:37] Zilinity: Lez go!
[0:24:58] NoahS116: good job
[0:25:02] Zilinity: agressive with the knights are scary.
[0:25:51] Zilinity: I keep forgetting about how knights move and that‚Äôs how I lose against the normal level bots
[0:26:08] VirtualVoyager: if he wouldnt sacrifice the roque you would put your roque uupp tthere and mamke him trade the roque to mate
[0:26:58] Zilinity: rip

[0:27:58] NoahS116: I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs uncommon to lead with a knight, but definitely not your typical opening
[0:28:56] NoahS116: you usually want to open up with a pawn because it opens you up a bit to start moving out pieces
[0:29:23] Zilinity: uuuummmm could move a pawn forward to protect one on the right
[0:29:59] Zilinity: welp fuck
[0:31:23] Zilinity: you guys are basically stalemated in the middle
[0:32:25] Zilinity: think he‚Äôs going after that pawn. your knight is protecting it though
[0:34:20] Zilinity: you can get rid of that knight with queen now I think‚Ä¶
[0:35:48] Zilinity: I‚Äôm enjoying this
[0:36:19] Zilinity: he‚Äôs about to take your castle‚Ä¶ not good
[0:37:44] Zilinity: he has a pawn/Queen protecting his castle‚Ä¶

[1:55:12] thejimmydeacon: How is he able to be involved in charges when being the victim?
[1:55:18] lawkedup007: I think he‚Äôs getting charge with a PD gun.
[1:55:19] Torrok: lawkedup007 no its a blip on the map that is real time, so other cops see exactly where they are until they go off duty
[1:55:41] lawkedup007: I know he had pd stuff
[1:56:00] Torrok: lawkedup007 he had 1 spikestrip and no other items
[1:56:03] il0veolivegarden: @lawkedup007 nah
[1:56:07] Torrok: on his personm
[1:56:07] lawkedup007: @torrok it‚Äôs constantly tracking you??
[1:56:24] Torrok: lawkedup007 its tracking the cop yes
[1:56:35] lawkedup007: oh I thought he was getting charge with that.
[1:56:39] CinoriThePriest: the only thing ive never understood on nopixel is how you can "know whats going on in a shootout" after your downed. i get the first hand witness but like if your downed how do you know everything that went on
[1:56:47] lawkedup007: well that‚Äôs good.
[1:56:47] Torrok: only way to get rid of the blip is forcing them off duty
[1:56:50] il0veolivegarden: @Torrok and cornwods phone
[1:56:58] thejimmydeacon: Slacks is arguing mechanics with the others trying to help K apparently
[1:57:10] lawkedup007: damn that‚Äôs hella risky to do that then. have to be constantly moving b
[1:57:24] il0veolivegarden: 1440m for robing a cop is insane

[1:57:59] CinoriThePriest: thats the problem ive had most times i see a cop.  yeah i got shot down from nowhere and then saw so and so rob my pockets. like how you know your "dead/down"
[1:58:23] lawkedup007: yeah I think that was brought up so it‚Äôs not constantly getting robbed.
[1:58:42] Furyform: cops were loot boxed because guns didn't exist yet, so now we have them and it didn't change
[1:59:32] bmco89: I love when I get the same 10 songs in a playlist of over 300
[2:00:09] lawkedup007: @timmac what is it your doing??

[2:01:17] thejimmydeacon: cornwood been talking like his voice is going out of style
[2:01:19] Torrok: which is why they upped the money
[2:01:55] Owlman82: @Torrok wait what? so you can't do the runs at night? wtf
[2:01:58] thejimmydeacon: PPO trying to make them charge K for 3k minutes instead of 1770
[2:02:20] lawkedup007: omg that one day when you were just sitting in random spots at the house. everytime when Mr k got there you were in a different spot shit had me cracking up.

[2:06:20] jkpdos: How's grime now?
[2:06:21] Owlman82: is there a way to just farm the water?
[2:06:37] SFGMOD: @thejimmydeacon i had to stop watching, everybody wants to just throw him in jail for 3 days
[2:07:09] Owlman82: just think about all the lockpicks he could have in 3 days tho LUL
[2:07:09] thejimmydeacon: Cornwood won't shut up, keeps saying the same shit 20 times
[2:07:22] SFGMOD: he's basically offering to give closure to like 6 cases and cops just don't seem to care

[2:08:03] thejimmydeacon: Slacks just came back
[2:08:17] SubZer0Echo: A conversation about nothing
[2:08:34] thejimmydeacon: Just straight up said they're not taking the deal
[2:08:39] thejimmydeacon: INSANE
[2:08:59] thejimmydeacon: He's been held hostage for 3 hours irl
[2:09:34] Lepaca: How dare the cops charge K for the crimes he commited Madge
[2:09:42] SlimTDC: lol
[2:09:49] thejimmydeacon: THREE THOUSAND PLUS MINUTES
[2:09:54] thejimmydeacon: THAT'S FUCKING RIDICULOUS
[2:09:58] inkfierry: Lmao 3000plus hours now
[2:10:18] thejimmydeacon: But that's after being a start at 1440
[2:10:35] Lepaca: they aren't adding time for shits and giggles
[2:10:39] inkfierry: But slacks already stated its an umbrella
[2:11:32] SFGMOD: 2700 minutes
[2:11:36] SFGMOD: is final
[2:11:50] SFGMOD: they basically all ran away
[2:11:54] thejimmydeacon: He is pissed the fuck off that they made a deal and instead they doubled him
[2:11:54] SFGMOD: and left slacks to tell him
[2:12:22] SFGMOD: not great
[2:12:24] thejimmydeacon: He's ranting

[2:12:42] SFGMOD: they left the room for like 45 mins and added charges
[2:12:45] SFGMOD: instead of dropping em
[2:12:49] thejimmydeacon: Basically "don't fucking RP with the cops they pick and choose"
[2:13:00] LavosTRD: cornwood wasnt around in 2.0(?) when the whole stacking charges thing went down
[2:13:14] LavosTRD: its like everyone forgot
[2:13:30] LavosTRD: its why umbrella charges were put in
[2:14:09] thejimmydeacon: "Drop the robbery to kidnapping and Drop the criminal uses, and I'll basically close half a dozen cases for you" for like...300 minutes off. Instead, left for an hour and he gets more added
[2:14:11] SFGMOD: he's getting both
[2:14:38] Th3Ch0: th3ch0Love
[2:14:41] halos420: He's getting 3 days in jail. Fucking crazy honestly lol.
[2:14:51] thejimmydeacon: The 3 days is solely for robbing a cop, not the hot gun included
[2:14:52] SFGMOD: kidnapping is 100x worse then shooting a cop
[2:14:59] Funami: 3 days is nuts
[2:15:18] halos420: He didn't even rob him he technically kidnapped him but they're throwing everything in there
[2:15:20] thejimmydeacon: He wants it dropped to kidnapping because that was the plan from the start
[2:15:23] Destroses5100: @SFGMOD its kidnapping and taking equipment, kidnapping alone is only 100 months
[2:15:25] inkfierry: No kidnapping is 100 months
[2:15:51] TheRowdyRandy: lol dumping cop cars in the ocean for days among everything else. REKT
[2:15:54] halos420: They aren't even charging him with kidnapping an Leo for 100 months either
[2:15:57] trizziturbo: 2700 months
[2:15:59] inkfierry: And that's what his trying to say it was never his intention to rob
[2:15:59] LavosTRD: this really is a yikes situation
[2:16:03] SFGMOD: technically he robbed him which is 1 day plus the extra day for posession the pd equipment
[2:16:08] trizziturbo: 2700 min
[2:16:08] xJOKURv: its wild that he touched pd gun for like 5 seconds... but the lady he planted it on.. got nothing really
[2:16:20] trizziturbo: yeah
[2:16:37] bmco89: I've always thought 3 days and longer for a jail sentence is more like being banned then its being in jail
[2:17:18] inkfierry: Yep and that's what his trying to say to slacks and cornwood i
[2:17:22] Destroses5100: yeah he woulda been fine if he just had cornwood toss the gun away, but he had him drop it and he picked it up

[2:17:55] SFGMOD: theres no mechanics to jail break
[2:17:56] oG_RVRS: Mac, what would you consider a fair/balanced jail time?
[2:17:57] Lepaca: Im a big defender of "actions and consequences" but Im not blind to the fact that this sucks for Kebun. It's a bit extreme
[2:18:04] oG_RVRS: timmacWAVE btw
[2:18:43] xJOKURv: the worse part is that i think this was all for a story with Tessa..and now that wont happen
[2:19:00] LavosTRD: if mack was still around he could have pulled rank lol
[2:19:14] thejimmydeacon: The rookies are all trying to get every charge to stick on K, Cornwood and Slacks aren't
[2:19:22] oG_RVRS: enjoying the rp drama  üçø
[2:19:45] LavosTRD: i feel like all of the OG cop characters would not be doing this

[2:20:27] oG_RVRS: Wrangler def would pull something like this
[2:20:27] LavosTRD: there is no RP in 2700 mins
[2:21:02] xJOKURv: 3 days in jail is wild
[2:21:09] thejimmydeacon: They're back
[2:21:15] BigJoeP1mpDaddy: the prison isnt really set up for good rp either
[2:21:52] thejimmydeacon: "Why would you hold me here for three hours promising to make a deal when you don't"
[2:22:22] oG_RVRS: maybe they could jail everyone in the same spot, fresh faces in and out
[2:22:27] LavosTRD: at this point, what is the differrencce between this and F8 quitting and taking a 3 day ban?
[2:22:29] thejimmydeacon: "Squeal and we'll give you your original charges" THIS IS INSANE

[2:23:19] thejimmydeacon: One of them called the judge during to get this to happen
[2:23:35] GrandGuy95: i saw him get shot and switched it off because i know 5 hrs later we get no where lol
[2:24:18] thejimmydeacon: told em "Give me everything" he's not folding
[2:24:25] GrandGuy95: they warned him to surrender and then shot himbut yah its what it is
[2:24:29] niw18: To play devil's advocate. If go to the light, others will take advantage of it. Through that a lot of minutes, especially since  it's only roleplay.
[2:24:34] Destroses5100: i mean, i get getting shot after stealing pd equipment and vehicle, the charges being so heavy is the rough part
[2:25:24] thejimmydeacon: "Tell me your stories and you're down to 1500 minutes" egregious strongarming
[2:25:35] GrandGuy95: he didnt really steal it he took it so he wouldnt get shot or tazed by cornwood but he had it on him
[2:25:39] niw18: yes I get that
[2:25:50] niw18: this hell of alot of  time\
[2:26:10] xJOKURv: those pd guns need to be dumped. tbh... the plan wont work cause i feel they know who has them so plants are useless
[2:26:21] GrandGuy95: you punish ppl that rp
[2:26:27] thejimmydeacon: Called out Slacks for trying to keep captain demoted/fired
[2:26:46] inkfierry: So just a question  does that mean that lawyer should go down for the same now
[2:26:51] niw18: to me 1440  minutes should  be the cap

[2:32:51] RoronoaZoro: even if he snitches they won‚Äôt drop the 1 day jail time charge so what‚Äôs the point of snitching
[2:32:53] SFGMOD: the issues at this point is they started at 1700 months, disappeared for an hour and came back with added charges after trying to make a deal
[2:33:01] SFGMOD: went from 1700 to 3000
[2:33:31] niw18: are you still  immune damage from sewers

[2:33:50] RoronoaZoro: getting caught robbing a cop is an instant day in jail
[2:34:22] RoronoaZoro: and if you get caught with their gun after robbing them it‚Äôs 3 days
[2:34:25] SFGMOD: it was made to stop lootboxing cops

[2:43:13] xJOKURv: thats a whole house...for touching a pd gun for 5 secs and not even holding it
[2:43:37] RoronoaZoro: the dna is crazy because you can‚Äôt do anything to get rid of it
[2:43:46] thejimmydeacon: Slacks is getting pissy for being told the truth
[2:43:47] Medemon: It's not just this incident this is all of his cases that he is connected to
[2:43:47] loooooney: After that K said he is just going to shoot everybody now
[2:43:58] xJOKURv: still crazy the council lady held gun..shot gun.. left dna on gun. and PD sided with her
[2:43:59] Torrok: a pd gun that cost the officer what to buy? a few dollars

[2:44:11] thejimmydeacon: or douse it in gasoline
[2:44:20] getmeoutofiraq: @Timmac mr k made the point killing a cop is less of a crime then robbing them
[2:44:37] RoronoaZoro: @niw18 he will lose it they didn‚Äôt screw him on the charges the charges are just crazy
[2:44:46] thejimmydeacon: And not even "douse in gas" to torch, iirc gasoline rids fingerprints
[2:44:52] SFGMOD: as soon as K starting killing a bunch of cops, its going to change

[2:45:06] explicitsmith: no charge should be a day unless its something insanely bad
[2:45:16] RoronoaZoro: @sfgmod it won‚Äôt change because they don‚Äôt mind them killing tbem funny enough they just don‚Äôt want people lootboxing cops
[2:45:25] thejimmydeacon: This is the where clips for the start of the Hell Week compliations come from

[2:54:55] sirable48: the girl who k planted a gun on is still free gsr + btw XD letter of the law XD
[2:55:02] abc1121: the unfortunate thing is you have to enforce it for any chance of change

[2:56:04] GrandGuy95: should f8 lol

[2:56:11] ccoolracer128: hopefully they got everything out of the house lol

[2:56:31] loooooney: You don't try they on the leader of CG .  Someone who can and will bring hell on the cops
[2:56:44] guilliman_0: just give parole for day or two
[2:56:53] HelveticaStandardBold: thats sick
[2:56:57] explicitsmith: they arent raiding b/c they got everything that was on cornwood so no reason to raid
[2:57:09] abc1121: it really sucks but i feel like kebun is one of the most creative rp'ers on the server he'll make it work somehow
[2:57:11] brokenpawn: i think the big issue is they put a robbing the cop and then the possesion charge and they both have the same time for whats literally the same thing
[2:57:14] ccoolracer128: whats funny is, there really isnt anything in there for crims to do too
[2:57:29] StreamElements: The thing is, you're like a brother to me, but at the end of the day, when it's all said and done, business is business, and not for nothing, it is what it is and that's that.

[2:59:51] chidori_senpai: JUST cause of the minutes in prison

[3:00:15] cmerk_: 3200 min 154k
[3:00:17] RoronoaZoro: the crazy part is one charge is a day for robbing a cop then another is a day for having their gun so one robbery is like 150k and 3 days LUL
[3:00:20] awwDrats: its 2.5 days in prison + all those hours to make the money back
[3:00:22] reaks187: bro they want peanut to pay 75k for some bs
[3:00:23] llama21mango: that's max grind which isn't even possible

[3:00:38] Lepaca: The house that Arrowhead built, a story in 24 parts now available as an audiobook
[3:00:46] Crazybro: one of the girls literally said "they increased robbing because we kept getting robbed so when they just shoot us only they'll increase that too" That BLEW my mind
[3:00:47] chidori_senpai: and K does a lot of rp so its not always doing money back to back
[3:01:02] reaks187: they want to charge peanut 75k for human trafficking
[3:01:06] Zilinity: you‚Äôre literally robbing banks all day to make that money
[3:01:41] llama21mango: what happened to officer discretion?
[3:01:49] chidori_senpai: i feel like since the gun licenses are out, they should reduce back these charges to how they were, lower
[3:01:59] awwDrats: its k, there is no officer discretion
[3:02:04] RoronoaZoro: @zilinity there‚Äôs no banks to even rob and the robberies you can do don‚Äôt make anywhere that type of money
[3:02:12] loooooney: They added rooms to the house

[3:58:49] reaks187: dna is such a cooked thing in this server
[3:58:55] xJOKURv: i feel they know ooc and feel bad for her lol
[3:59:03] jnzl: Opposite, dna is way undercoooked
[3:59:11] celestedgaf7: soo trying with a 4th case to get Possession changed?
[3:59:15] slymox: @xJOKURv letter of the law
[3:59:15] reaks187: nah
[3:59:22] Derikbikes: instant dna results has to be the worst thing in the server
[3:59:22] Luthercorpz: Even if you charge ppl with possession like K should have won his case in court based on reasonable doubt, PD fk ups and prosecution from PD was horrendous.
[3:59:41] slymox: That was the precedent set by timid judges
[3:59:43] Luthercorpz: K or any case like that should be adjudicated if its that blatant in trial.
[3:59:44] kayc_luv: so the president should have been set with Murphy‚Äôs case that‚Äôs where they messed up
[3:59:48] BigGiblets: they can fix it with adding ‚Äúknowingly possessing‚Äù or ‚Äúintentionally possessing‚Äù
[4:00:19] slymox: @BigGiblets ^^
[4:01:19] nconn8: @BigGiblets then it would never be charged lol
[4:01:46] Ragestrike: its an rp server not a pvp server, there is not winning or losing, dna is a tool to help facilitate RP. and story lines, its your job chat to enjoy the show and not complain about fairness.
[4:02:05] jnzl: Who said she was shooting at a hill, and didnt just miss get stabbed (i know what actually happened) PD didnt even consider the 911 being a valid scenario
[4:02:13] Luthercorpz: If cops have to charge the charge Judges should really have to find not guilty in blatantly flawed cases not just guilty every trial regardless of the trial.

[4:02:38] vzapp: chat do I throw a zyn in or nah
[4:02:46] TokSykMorty: I believe the term you are looking for is "Totality of Circunstance"
[4:03:10] BigGiblets: throw two in @vzapp
[4:03:27] slymox: @jnzl Yeah, it feels like the 911 being made was completely thrown out.
[4:03:29] RegulatorTTV: couldn‚Äôt she have missed her shot? bullets tend to do as far as they can before hitting something
[4:03:29] vzapp: @biggiblets upper deckers?
[4:03:43] BigGiblets: yee
[4:03:50] vzapp: lmaoo
[4:04:06] notwowayzz: @jnzl exactly PD can just pick and choose who to charge LUL
[4:04:40] Luthercorpz: Murphy was a clean civ, so was K and so is this lawyer chick. All three cases should be heavily leaning not guilty in court. Not slam dunk guilty cause "possession"
[4:04:47] greencurtain: pretty clear adeline is the bridge bandit ;)
[4:05:02] Luthercorpz: It's a doj problem not the cop that has to follow the law
[4:05:10] SoLo_SoCo: Letter of the law. Guilty
[4:05:12] celestedgaf7: or ya know, actually investigate
[4:05:18] TokSykMorty: look at "totality of circumstance
[4:05:31] Thunderous_Bastard: then why does every cop act like they need to or they're fired
[4:05:52] Furyform: The Judge on K's case specifically said, it's up to the cops to determine the spirit of the law first - and then if it goes to court it may be more letter of t he law
[4:05:59] DeeWee222: @Ragestrike the only thing about DNA is that its to OP at the moment. There is no way around to clean it off or even wear gloves to hide it. It shouldn't be in the system yet until both ways are accomplished
[4:06:09] Lepaca: code brown
[4:06:13] TMomenTzG: whats the difference between letter of the law vs spirit of the law? from what i understand of the two, it seems like the server should operate more on spirit then letter
[4:06:14] yolmoz: Yeah thats what sucks the most, There was about to be fun confession rp for a deal the cops leave the room and come back with 2x the time
[4:06:16] slymox: The laws were written, according to Crane, with leeway built in for the judges to rule on. The judges haven't ruled in any direction on them, so it's all "Letter of the law" BS
[4:06:18] Luthercorpz: True you can do that but once precedence is set like with Jp then Murphy you are stuck in shit position.
[4:06:22] notwowayzz: should have been there for X and murphy and K's case then, now it's just gonna look like they are picking and choosing. treated them like crims without any previous record
[4:06:42] celestedgaf7: It forces people to become felons even if theres reasonable doubt
[4:06:45] natelols: I remember watching Eli reduce for overall cooperation, respectfulness and extended hold times. All was based off of feeling about the situation.
[4:06:52] traps_spart77: Because there cops not detectives??
[4:06:53] SwagnificentTG: She‚Äôs going to hate cops forever if this gets pushed
[4:07:11] ViewbotReportingforDuty: who's she
[4:07:17] celestedgaf7: and the "letter of the law" removes even the ude of reasonable doubt in regards to possession

[4:08:09] OneOfAKindPanda: i was always thinking everyone on here used sharex i been using that for years now

[4:09:02] Atrociousnes: Ah
[4:09:07] Luthercorpz: @SwagnificentTG That doesnt matter man. He was clean at the time, no gsr, the cops did really fk up the investigation admitted it in court. It was reasonable doubt to the moon. The Judge buried the city ruling they way he did
[4:09:07] slymox: @xJOKURv yeah they set themselves up for  a shitstorm if they go against precedent.
[4:09:28] greencurtain: Judge Gatsby said holding that PD gun for 2seconds today was worth all the charges when cornwood phoned her.

[4:10:00] Furyform: YEAHHHH
[4:10:00] Ragestrike: lol
[4:10:00] Luthercorpz: Tonight K just got caught 100% deserved all charges. Just being fair
[4:10:03] TMomenTzG: hats the difference between letter of the law vs spirit of the law? from what i understand of the two, it seems like the server should operate more on spirit then letter.
[4:10:06] Atrociousnes: More money they don't want to spend
[4:10:06] Furyform: lol you said it while I was typing that
[4:10:22] RegulatorTTV: @greencurtain it is funny to think moving a gun from the ground to a car is possession. lol
[4:10:27] jnzl: DNA just comes off as anti-rp, K & Slacks were trying to run with the washed downstream, but noone else was willing to run with the rp
[4:10:42] boomcat8901: @RegulatorTTV goofy ah ah
[4:10:44] OneOfAKindPanda: maybe just putting to many files on the server with how many IMG are taken?
[4:10:49] postAmongUsist: @Luthercorpz the thing is they needed more than reasonable doubt, that's what an affirmative defense means
[4:10:50] Atrociousnes: Depends how it's used to be fair

[4:34:27] TheRealTweex: I see both sides but you are now removing a whole section of RP from crims b/c they just don't want to mess with cop b/c the punishment is way to harsh. Being basically soft banned for 2 days is kind of insane
[4:34:30] xJOKURv: would be crazy if the charges get increased now that its brought up that shooting pd is low risk...and K gets out and has hell week
[4:35:30] haplessvictim: hello errybody HahaBall

[7:43:11] aRobi95: Yeah! I see your arm move but the sound is a milisecond late
[7:43:36] aRobi95: Could you somehow route your pc audio throw the keyboard so there is less delay?

[7:44:49] SirConkerr: piano cam?
[7:45:17] SirConkerr: understandable
[7:45:44] aRobi95: Would it be possible to route your computer audio through your keyboard then to the goxlr?

[7:48:18] Grickshaft: uts funny how technology has changed so much, but audio has basically remained the same for 50 years
[7:48:36] aRobi95: Thats the problem with products marketed towards streamers. Saves money over true audio equipment but you miss out on cool features that others dont have
[7:48:58] Vikairius: Not really a way to adjust sound other than to alter people's ears to a point
[7:49:13] JayconeS: sound like u need a more industial mixing desk

[9:52:48] BitShifting: :-D
[9:52:59] Ozryal: Server would be dead with no crime. :)
[9:53:01] xtopspotx: does homie have a felony?
[9:53:06] Bob_The_Avenger: can they no rp cops just using offduty instead of taking them into the station?
[9:53:06] n1_majorlavon_: dont do crime in GTA üö∂üèæ
[9:53:09] n1_majorlavon_: ???
[9:53:17] IronHellion: @SevenTen710 The pardon didn't mean anything anyway he still had another felony
[9:53:17] BitShifting: Yea it's feels a bit silly just how hard he got hit with. All for Tessa damn
[9:53:21] Lepaca: dont fail to kindnap cops while carrying a hot gun
[9:53:31] Gh0stPog: yo, guns are out for public right ?
[9:53:35] Lordbidwell: Yeah first part of 4.0 was slow burn
[9:53:37] bodester1: it might have gone differently if cornwood was able to sign off just unfortunate
[9:53:50] Ozryal: @Gh0stPog like 72k or something
[9:53:53] ItzAHoax: i mean he could have used the command /offduty or w.e. it was
[9:53:58] ItzAHoax: doesnt that still work?
[9:54:02] jumdeez: getting scuffed like that is fucked
[9:54:03] Gh0stPog: @Ozryal damn
[9:54:06] thedrakmer69: ohh man and that just happened because he got greedy with a second g6 truck KEKW
[9:54:11] SevenTen710: @IronHellion the point of the pardon was to get the 30k to work toward an expungement
[9:54:12] bodester1: nah @itzahoax

[9:54:15] BitShifting: it's insane that PD have a track on them working all the time
[9:54:17] stealsthings: the biggest issue was cornwood was calling in a fake crash that downed an officer so people were already heading up that way
[9:54:19] Torrok: Lepaca don't fail to kidnap cops, while server has unfinished server mechanics that show up as prompt but not working.
[9:54:19] mattt210: every gun is gonna be hot at this point tbf no one is dumping them
[9:54:20] BitShifting: like what mechanic is that
[9:54:30] jumdeez: Have to bring him to mrpd to get him to sign off with 500 other cops there
[9:54:31] MysticGMAN: Headpops
[9:54:38] Mr_Jhin4: me watching last nights youtube clips monkaGIGA
[9:54:51] Lepaca: that has never been a thing, because it would be abused with kidnappings all day every day
[9:55:00] Hzero01: wait what happened? what i miss yesterday?
[9:55:11] IronHellion: @SevenTen710 he was never going for expungment, 500k? no shot, NP wants to keep crims crims m8

[9:55:31] Ozryal: @Hzero01 K got sent up to prison for 3700 time served to 2900 and 152k fine
[9:55:32] BitShifting: no*
[9:55:35] highway27: K "I Don't Care" is going to hit a new level
[9:55:36] stealsthings: should just but the old . in front of the url so much more useable for reddit
[9:55:39] ItzAHoax: @Lepaca how would it be abused? its it would have been meant for scuff, by that logic every command meant for scuff is abused all the time
[9:55:47] Hzero01: @ozryal WTF
[9:55:57] Lordbidwell: Reddit is ass timmacBARF
[9:55:59] thedrakmer69: @highway27 tbh the I don't care arc is great KEKW

[9:57:37] bodester1: what would you have done in that situation if you were the arresting officer?
[9:57:37] Ozryal: @Lordbidwell The big problem was 2900 of the time was for picking up an LEO gun... and kidnapping.  the hot gun had like 4x use of fire arm.... 1x death of a judge... 1x death of a doctor... multiple robberies....
[9:57:48] viewlessd: so how much will this get you after u sell for 50%?

[9:59:16] highway27: Saturday ?
[9:59:17] mrHopolotamus: he has to be logged in for the time to count?
[9:59:23] vzapp: he was saying he‚Äôs back in regular schedule‚Ä¶ just to have no rp
[9:59:25] theancientones1: It's 2700 minutes, I think 2 days

[9:59:57] callmefive: time cops spend on documentation vs time crim spend in prison crims win
[9:59:57] IronHellion: it was a harsh sentance for what would have been some fun sbs RP, tessa vs Cornwood would have been intersting for everyone, and poor nakkita she feel so bad. shes such a sweetheart
[9:59:59] vzapp: kebunDance kebunDance
