[3:34:12] AshuraX13: They need to do Custard RP NODDERS
[3:34:20] itsjustasummerjob: Wade was being chased by all of Yokai and held his own for AGES
[3:34:39] itsjustasummerjob: I did I did
[3:35:00] itsjustasummerjob: I think it went better than I expected
[3:35:06] itsjustasummerjob: I wasn‚Äôt shocked by any of his answers
[3:35:41] laxwall11: I think it went really well
[3:35:43] itsjustasummerjob: The only thing I think we need to work on is how he learns, because learning by failing first isn‚Äôt something the club can always afford
[3:35:45] arbucklezero: That conversation was so interesting that I had to go watch the pier VOD after
[3:36:02] itsjustasummerjob: In certain circumstances we can throw him in and see what happens, but others? It‚Äôs not gonna fly to take that L
[3:36:35] Kthanid: Especially on like drug stuff.
[3:36:36] itsjustasummerjob: I think there‚Äôs something deeper in his mentality that we need to address to get to why that‚Äôs how he thinks he learns best
[3:36:37] abblepiewit: katesYell
[3:36:45] Nightbot: Follow Kate on Twitter! twitter.com/katestark

[3:36:50] if0rg0t2remember: like its a valid way to learn but there has to be a way other than just tossing him off the deep end
[3:37:00] deathfrombelow7707: Failing is fine. But the grind back up is real in 4.0
[3:37:16] flathaed: Has Maxx's opinon of Mason changed at all after the talk?
[3:37:21] itsjustasummerjob: I think the issue is that‚Ä¶ Mason isn‚Äôt an active listener when he has no frame of reference for what he‚Äôs about to do. So like, walking him through it verbally does nothing. He won‚Äôt retain any of that info.
[3:37:25] Nightbot: If you have Amazon Prime you can subscribe via Twitch Prime, FOR FREE! See https://twitch.amazon.com/prime for more details.
[3:37:46] Kthanid: I THOUGHT I liked learning through failure, but for me it's actually just wanting a steady stream of constructive feedback.
[3:37:55] Nightbot: Follow Kate on Instagram! instagram.com/kate.ttv
[3:37:55] itsjustasummerjob: So when he says he just wants to be thrown in, it‚Äôs because talking him through it first wouldn‚Äôt stick anyway.
[3:38:06] A_Humble_Wooper: katesGiggle
[3:38:10] itsjustasummerjob: I think walking him through it - doing it WITH him is the key
[3:38:14] SilentPain86: oh i can understand that im also like this if i dont fail i dont learn, just telling or showing me something is useless
[3:38:18] if0rg0t2remember: I mean learn by doing not by failing surely right?

[3:38:43] itsjustasummerjob: I totally understand the mentality of why he THINKS that what he needs
[3:38:45] Symbiotic1: losing tools and fines are big costs
[3:39:04] itsjustasummerjob: but I think there‚Äôs another way we can help him without risking assets
[3:39:06] PacMan419: falling on your face is still forward progress
[3:39:08] Kthanid: Especially expensive tools like the chopping tool.
[3:39:13] laxwall11: like he wants to learn to chop but that tool is like 5k right? thats a big hit if it fucks up
[3:39:15] deathfrombelow7707: On the plus side. The slow build up in jobs. Like Rubs. There's 3 levels so going level by level will hopefully help Mason
[3:39:23] itsjustasummerjob: I think it was the first time y‚Äôall got a fine tho! And we have 10k set aside for that <3
[3:39:38] itsjustasummerjob: oh ok ok
[3:39:41] itsjustasummerjob: not horrible tho
