[8:32:13] Vizi797: It would maybe eat up some of the space in the weed room. What if you put the sink on a "counter". The counter is hollow and extends into the floor, it's deep enough to walk in a for few steps to the side to another drop into the room. This was hard to put into words and probably not clear lol

[10:34:40] GlitchBye: does it work well going up and down through the sink
[10:35:36] wizardiis: the faucet again?
[10:37:16] Vizi797: It's been a fun day kivaCozy
[10:37:59] wizardiis: kivaCozy
[10:38:34] Jerco2020: I just flashed back from this song
[10:38:37] Jerco2020: uwuWOW
[10:39:05] alexspector2: Still planning on moving to texas?
[10:40:39] wizardiis: kivaSus
[10:40:49] alexspector2: nice, im moving to sweden from the uk in a month
[10:41:03] alexspector2: nervous 😂
[10:41:12] Jellysamm: is it wide enough?
[10:41:17] MiruMoonie: maybe too narrow?
[10:41:24] revluster: cool
[10:41:35] Thrath: Maybe the faucet on the corner kivaSus
[10:43:06] Vizi797: Was it just the countertop when you tested earlier? or were the walls there
[10:43:55] Figueronie: is it the one wood piece behind Ants head?
[10:44:06] TheDrunkenBandit0: kivaMadge
[10:45:18] KadeTea: maybe the issue is the black and white tile? that was the only thing that changed from before
[10:45:18] Vizi797: You may have to have a place to stand at the top of the ladder yea
[10:46:06] MarcohYolo: catJAM
[10:46:24] zeman94: Is it the front of the counter?
[10:46:25] havsangelwings7: Maybe the top part of the ladder being covered?
[10:46:38] alexspector2: sink too tall?
[10:47:01] paintsmeller: If the ladder works like other gta ladders, maybe that white cabinet wall in front is stopping you possibly?
[10:47:34] PrisonicDreams: These songs will always remind me of my dad singing them aloud in the truck when I was little. chalupaNODDERS
[10:48:26] MarcohYolo: was it cuz the ladder was underneath?
[10:49:00] paintsmeller: One solution if possible could be to raise the ladder so the top is parallel with the countertop
[10:49:06] wizardiis: kivaDed
[10:49:29] Ashtahh: Seems like the you need a certain amount of clearance for the character model
[10:49:53] Jerco2020: And you had it already working right?
[10:50:42] Vizi797: Yea it worked earlier before building out the rest of the kitchen
[10:50:52] Jerco2020: uwuUGH

[10:52:10] StandardJake: that’s so sick
[10:52:36] Vizi797: You must need clearance above and in front for the character to actually go up and over kivaDed
[10:53:12] Vizi797: KEKW
[10:53:19] Elksy: BIG jump
[10:53:22] Thrath: What if you put like plates or something on top so it looks like dishes ready to be cleaned KEKW
[10:53:34] wizardiis: kivaLUL
[10:53:37] Vizi797: Andi's sick of this ladder's shit kivaHAHA
[10:54:26] Rtik: uhnRee
[10:54:26] Anrisacia: kivaSuffer
[10:54:26] wizardiis: kivaDesk
[10:54:50] grakzo: 🪜 just getting comfy
[10:55:25] PrisonicDreams: Would a platform in the middle of the drop work as a way in and out?
[10:55:31] paintsmeller: You could make it so that the exit faces the stovetop, but that might mean you have to move the rectangle opening
[10:56:05] PrisonicDreams: Nevermind. Looks to short.
[10:56:19] lord_dragox412: @paintsmeller That's how Stanley burns to death monkaS
[10:56:35] paintsmeller: @lord_dragox412 lol truu
[10:56:42] Figueronie: could you theoretically make the ladder shorter so the character can just jump to the top of it then jump out the sink, bypassing the gta ladder mechanics?
[10:57:06] paintsmeller: ^ that could work
[10:59:36] paintsmeller: I assume gta mechanics make it so that you have to have a human amount of height to be able to jump on a platform
[10:59:47] zeman94: You could also make an exit hole in the gap behind the refrigerator
[11:01:02] Anrisacia: Success kivaCheer
