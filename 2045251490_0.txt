[5:02:23] Morningstarter: you have a problem with hoarding
[5:02:24] Jarathin: so many
[5:02:25] dume5330: perhaps a reason the southside is lagging
[5:02:26] Harcini: put a password on the door
[5:02:30] csmithy: the worst part is they dont degrade so the amount is only gonna keep increasing lmao
[5:02:31] PsychoBKilla: That is about to be a crash zone LUL
[5:02:33] Swordsman75: discovered why mosleys is so laggy EZ
[5:02:34] NonstopBlue: imagine a blueprint trade npc gamble KEKW
[5:02:36] eborcurean: maybe, just maybe common blueprint drops are a bit high for mechanics
[5:02:41] ben0809: YOINK
[5:02:41] zippybln2: the more important question is... why are you hording it KEKW
[5:02:42] Gemcity5: Need a bison just for the number of bp
[5:02:44] Thorsstar: yeah its gonna cause lag if in a location
[5:02:49] Gyfx: The real question is why are you grabbing them? OMEGALAUGHING
[5:02:49] Archangelos1: YEP

[5:03:19] CptApples: Kylie is a hoarder nodd
[5:03:19] Vorpel85: just start dropping them on a door of an enemy
[5:03:21] Darkri19: She wants to make the house more laggy xd
[5:03:22] PsychoBKilla: I doubt it's even a thing
[5:03:25] ISkeenssI: conflict baiting hehe
[5:03:28] Oddbear82: i think they need to reduce the % to get them
[5:03:31] PsychoBKilla: LUL

[5:03:45] KewlKittyProductions: lol that would be funny
[5:03:46] Harcini: blueprint the new TP
[5:03:51] Gemcity5: Drive by on PMW and just throw them at workers lol
[5:03:53] AetherMana: load bomb someones house LUL
[5:03:59] Matrix8369: the houses blueprint room lol
[5:04:01] PsychoBKilla: blueprint prank shdiHeh
[5:04:08] Myki_Cameda: its all being stored in the blueprint room of the house, creating a 'Time barrier' that lags everyone out who gets to close
[5:04:13] dume5330: could have hte blueprints degrade more so casual ppl have more difficulty keeping them and shops will easily replace
[5:04:22] Randomviewerr: calling people out seems the most effective to me tbh
[5:04:23] Fr0stwav3: peepoGiggles throw loads of junk at his house so it creates trash = there always being people swarming his house
[5:04:28] Matrix8369: its a BP TP
[5:04:34] killer90214: yeah no wonder why it gets a bit laggy around the shop, with all them on the ground
[5:04:55] PsychoBKilla: nodd
[5:04:59] ben0809: nodd
[5:05:00] killer90214: yeah
[5:05:02] Dannytsu: it does, thats why ur house is laggy
[5:05:02] tedium7: tink hmmm
[5:05:04] Machatie: Its strange those blueprints to decay
[5:05:04] Vatinius: Buddha had to ask devs to fix their house when Harry had put down a shit ton of props on the ground KEKW
[5:05:05] L4zyb4ssturd: maybe thats why people lag when they go past
[5:05:07] Sacher: buddha needed devs to remove stuff because they placed too much
[5:05:07] Morningstarter: might be the lagspike when loading in house interiors
[5:05:11] Gemcity5: Wonder what happens if sanitation workers put blueprints in the scrapper
[5:05:12] Vorpel85: wonder if someone with a lower end pc gets hit harder or if it is more server side.
[5:05:20] eborcurean: kinda need a bin, but then that'd get used as storage i guess
[5:05:21] comfycathie: loading assetts?
[5:05:25] Harcini: imagine if mechanics could trade blueprints for money like the mechanic's receipt system
[5:05:28] Myki_Cameda: Havnt seen any of the Janitors around in a while to clean all this up
