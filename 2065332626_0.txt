[1:20:24] DominickPerrero: Are they using AI for curing cancer or anything that helps humanity?
[1:20:26] SuitableVice: I think if someone is drawing some art and then they use AI to analyze what they drew only and assist from there
[1:20:36] wujci28072001: Dominick it might reach that though
[1:20:43] Agathon_nl: a lot of good outside of artistic stuff
[1:20:47] IceBadger: nVidia has made AI that can improve its own AI chips, so its started self improving its performance

[1:21:24] SuitableVice: Ai can help with computing and problem solving. But even then it needs controlled
[1:21:32] wujci28072001: Ai is been used a lot just out of peoples view
[1:21:32] CmdrPain: Russia

[1:24:08] CmdrPain: Its basically a filter called a LoRa which takes your prompt and the trained data to combine them.
[1:24:08] Skaithakk: yea, it's progressing extremely fast MONKA
[1:24:23] SkyLineRaider: This is also more of an artistic thing than OpenAi showing off the best they can do
[1:24:23] Sparkyy_xz: @wolfabelle hewoooo wolfaHey wolfaL
[1:24:27] m0stlywater: thats the thing that scares everyone is how fast the Ai is progressing

[1:24:35] holy__llama: it will slow down eventually. just like with driverless cars
[1:24:37] wujci28072001: That's what happened when the internet came alive
[1:24:43] IceBadger: all this AI stuff only took off like 3-4 years ago, we are already here with videos
[1:24:47] CmdrPain: Ai music getting better too.
[1:24:48] NasserTee: "boi what - plan z" is great too. it's a metal artist who used ai models to change his own voice to plankton from spongebob
[1:24:49] DarthVeigar: wolfaHii @sparkyy_xz
[1:24:50] meeenglish: you figure millions of people got access to this over the past two years or so, a lot more work is being done now
[1:24:59] dabbasaurus19: analog to digital
[1:25:07] CmdrPain: Oh yeah theyve now removed solid game media
[1:25:08] Sylar996: people have a monetary interest in it getting better will only get worse
[1:25:16] wujci28072001: Ai is part of life we can't deny it no more ig
[1:25:20] lordburka: 10? more like 1/2
[1:25:21] totonred: Lots of use of AI in job applications and uni assessments
[1:25:31] Zaaroc: Also, this band got shit on for the use of AI, even tho it's a valid use given they pay the artist still OMEGALUL
[1:25:32] wujci28072001: Yeh toto
[1:25:51] IceBadger: I can just imagine like madlib style movies, where it asks you for things and you just fill out and you get some brand new movie using your prompts
[1:25:55] wujci28072001: Didn't the application for onx also got ai proofed?
[1:26:00] unsolicitedsloth: This is as huge of a change as learning to use electricity or steam power, except we're discovering new things significantly faster and putting them to practical use within weeks or months, not decades.

[1:26:39] Ellzybub: some peoples laziness knows no bounds
[1:26:44] PartTimeNinja_: my manager recently talked about how many cv's were obviously AI generated in the last recruitment wave OMEGADANCEBUTFAST
[1:26:45] JohnJKnapp: AI is already in our phones for certain things. our GPS map apps try to predict our destinations based on your past trips and trends.
[1:26:48] jummper__: oh this is good
[1:26:50] Thorekh: I think in about 50-100 years AI will probably be used for all the editing and graphic design etc. and all the people doing that will probably end up learning how to apply what they know to AI
[1:26:56] JPsmart: google is fighting ad block RAGEY
[1:26:57] kingdomFX: nah this is AI hybird
[1:27:01] Doublexbaugh: The apps not even hard, there is only 3 questions that need more than a sentence

[1:27:26] kingdomFX: they had actors and superimposed ai over them, its not com-pletely ai
[1:27:27] jummper__: they have a video on how they made it
[1:27:28] eod_soldier: yeah
[1:27:29] UltamaZ: makes you wonder if they will use AI to make the baseline and then people edit it
[1:27:31] IceBadger: Imagine if you could take an Anime and make it live action just using AI
[1:27:36] spAnser: They filmed it for real and used AI to make it anime.
[1:27:46] ExoticPotatoe: Its not all AI, its more like an AI filter
[1:27:52] JPsmart: British
[1:27:55] Thorekh: @wujci28072001, in 10 years probably soon, people will complain about it before they start using it i think
[1:28:07] hell_girl_sisi: during my exams someone in our groupchat sent a link to chatgpt and said "just put the questions in there and it will give you the answers" AINTNOWAY
