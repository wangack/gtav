[2:28:11] BodyInMedBay: I game in 480i
[2:28:11] frituurkoning223: 1440p, here, totally worth it
[2:28:12] mcDeRose: i wouldnt mind a 4070 when the price falls some more, but a 3060 is plenty
[2:28:13] Bornit: I do
[2:28:26] Hiloboblol: o/
[2:28:27] ravenhikari: i don't even watch videos in 1440k
[2:28:29] PlatosCavern: 1440p 27inch, cant go back
[2:28:35] FAYRmusic: i game at 1080 but i scale the games to render at 1440p so i dont get aliasing artifacts
[2:28:38] notreallynerdy: i feel like resolution is one of those things where once you've gone higher its hard to go back lower
[2:28:42] mcDeRose: i am just crazy about proper color because photographs, otherwise im happy with whatever

[2:29:04] AshesToAsh3s: HELL YES... 4k >>>>>
[2:29:06] ser_loony: right now? might as well go 4k
[2:29:08] Hiloboblol: depends on the game imo
[2:29:11] AshesToAsh3s: 2K was fine to settle for
[2:29:18] frituurkoning223: when I just got it it was not worth it at all, felt kinda like I wasted money, but when playing at a friends place, man I can't go back to 1080p
[2:29:23] FAYRmusic: 1440p is really good, 4k is overkill
[2:29:26] AshesToAsh3s: Its so pretty Gladge
[2:29:27] RogueBear: i think id make the choice based on the type of games you play. if you're playing shooters or anything real time competitive you'll want 1080
[2:29:30] ItsHuego: I can't edit pics and vids on 1080p, I would literally lose my mind
[2:29:39] AshesToAsh3s: @FAYRmusic if you have the money to burn.. go for it imo..

[2:30:53] Nakkida: I think Harms has trouble with aspect ratios on some games when using the full scope of his big ol monitor
[2:30:56] AshesToAsh3s: I'm at 1440p on a 144hz panel Gladge
[2:31:00] Nakkida: like not all games support it or some such

[5:16:28] Chanceemergency: @indigodream_ that's not true at all the vaccine is supposed to prevent. But it's only 85% effective if EVERYONE is vaccinated. It's called herd immunity.
[5:16:47] ObadiahSnow: what if i dont believe in god Awkward
[5:16:47] Ho_Lee_Sit: I go out daily just lucky i guess
