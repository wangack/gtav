[2:22:27] SilentStormAU: LUL
[2:22:27] VariantIN: I think the scanners are broken in general
[2:22:28] He_Who_Shall_Not_Be_Named: The DNA is scuffed overall. It doesnt show if you search or hand it to someone, only if it is on the ground
[2:22:28] skinnylegend000: open ocean labs the backup lab for scuff.
[2:22:29] IsaackEz: classic
[2:22:29] ChirithyChi: I thought it only tells you who threw / placed something on the ground?
[2:22:29] jd2881: That DNA scanner is wildly inconsistent.
[2:22:35] Subparcereal: i think DNA is RNG
[2:22:37] bexnes21: ill tell u ooc theres more to then just you and him and its bugged broda
[2:22:42] Asmodean01: only if it's been on the ground from what I remember when I first saw it
[2:22:48] Crosstak: I thought DNA only gets picked up if you throw a gun, not hand it off
[2:23:01] timedoggg: the legal aid pd gun had no dna either @Lt_Custard
[2:23:02] Abester47: Maybe it is taking into account gloves idk at this point, its nor consistent at all
[2:23:39] FastEddeh: guy can't remember lmao
[2:23:44] RadahTatTat: Peppo
[2:23:54] RadahTatTat: *Peppo’s memory AAAA
[2:24:08] villemHD: Well that dna scuff sucks
[2:24:09] abdirahmanmomo: it’s a simple answer 😂
[2:24:11] IsaackEz: Imagine that /me puts gloves works KEKW
[2:24:20] blazemarley: he head popped chat. his frequency doesnt show anymore
[2:24:24] blazemarley: KEKW
[2:24:25] Asmodean01: If gloves became a thing, then that would just be a useless pd thing. Everyone and their mothers would be wearing gloves 24/7
[2:24:47] RadahTatTat: @villemhd a lot of things scuff out when people headpop
[2:24:58] FastEddeh: gloves could easily work but theres no real reason to implement it when 99% of crims get caught right after doing something and would never remove their gloves
[2:25:01] Asmodean01: Yeah I know, responing to someone else.
[2:25:03] pitkula: I don't think it's scuff. It's only one way DNA can appear to an item. If that way didn't happen then there is no DNA
[2:25:19] FreakyWade: I have so many questions about the DNA thing. Genuinely curious how the whole thing evolves
[2:25:27] SymbioAgori: its not really dna scuff, since the machine is mostly used againts ppl just yeeting stuff
[2:25:28] JakoLegend118: jeeesus

[2:25:46] SpaceDriveZero: was he gsr positive?
[2:25:48] JetfireZB: 1 year and 100k o7
[2:25:52] watermelon3001: sniffthenewchatter
[2:25:53] omascas: @SpaceDriveZero yup

[2:25:58] JakoLegend118: thats insane from that to that
[2:25:59] evilomh: undead stelio o7
[2:25:59] ArenaKrusher: the way the DNA mechanic works is pretty wierd, may not be intented and crims know how to avoid it by now
[2:26:05] SerrikVorrik: did we ever figure out who changed it to 1 tree tree in the mdt
[2:26:08] elex731: elex731 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 26 months! 
[2:26:09] MrHyde81: I'm sure he littered some bullet casings as well
[2:26:12] Abester47: I mean thats going to be the common theme, civs finally turing into crims. They took time to grind money
[2:26:19] omascas: that was Stelio? Cornwood is gonna be so disapointed
[2:26:34] Wheez_3D: 19 hours and 100k oof
[2:27:52] matterwave23: @Abester47 Civs aren't gonna risk 100k fines though.

[2:28:40] ArenaKrusher: @matterwave23 95% of "civs" are just crims not caught yet
[2:29:06] ArenaKrusher: make sense that they carry weapons to defend themself
[2:29:28] enser27: planted  gun o7 release and investigate
[2:29:38] whotheheckisnj: im loving the stardew valley soundtrack
[2:29:46] FastEddeh: the question is why did two of the glendale drivers end up shot
[2:30:10] RadahTatTat: ooooh yeah that brandishing call from yesterday AAAA
[2:30:25] duncjw: good evening Custy good evening / time zone chat

[2:31:11] IsaackEz: PauseChamp ?
[2:31:20] purus0: ?
[2:31:38] FastEddeh: oof that would suck if the evidence gets lost
[2:31:39] matterwave23: @ArenaKrusher Yeah, that's what I meant. Stelio is no civ if he is carrying a PD gun willingly.
[2:31:49] spacebunz666: another streamer earlier said sharex was fucked up
[2:32:11] VSDuck: ShareX works fine for me
[2:32:25] FastEddeh: could wait to prosecute until you get it back
[2:32:31] codfcbanter: vod review time
[2:32:51] RadahTatTat: HACKERMANS
[2:33:07] limerick2018: looking forward to this interrogation peppo is great
[2:33:13] omascas: lmao
[2:33:20] notwowayzz: @matterwave23 PD can be planted as well just like cops chose to believe the lawyer that got caught with PD gun and was gsr positive
[2:33:36] Chronophylos: imgur is always fucked

[2:37:09] VeteranClacky: windows has built in clipping tool if it helps
[2:37:09] Sightose: PNG post nut gag
[2:37:10] Crosstak: I have ShareX copy the image, then copy the imgur link. This way, I can just hit Win + V to bring up the clipboard history and get the picture that way
[2:37:12] Q_Neaux: convert png into jpeg more than likely
[2:37:13] dammsmokey: who was it that got caught with the pd one?

[4:10:24] omascas: does he have a house key? you have to use it check that too
[4:10:31] spicyville: ejection incoming
[4:10:43] xMistressMayhem: LUL
[4:10:59] Daniie: @omascas he cant as theres no way to check what house the key is for or if its even valid
[4:11:16] DocRavage: They can't raid from just a key yet i don;'t think
[4:11:20] LansuEV: Mystery key
[4:11:24] JediJacob_: gun in the lockbox? or did you put it in the evidence locker
[4:11:44] spicyville: now would be the time to set the precedence
[4:11:53] FastEddeh: its a new lap record
[4:11:58] Denraoden: Also is someone has a stolen key and you raid a guy on accident, that would be a nightmare
[4:11:58] mr_forbes_95: ask for consent to raid the house the key is for
[4:12:01] omascas: @Daniie that sucks
[4:12:12] Lilliphus: that's not even a precedence that's a legal issue LUL

[4:12:19] Cardslapper: Gotta wait til he's the Commish to set precedent
[4:12:31] spicyville: I mean a good officer would try every house in the city right Kappa
[4:12:52] FastEddeh: raiding someone off a key is messy af because they could've robbed a different person of that house key
[4:12:55] its_alae: Rib eye over RP?
[4:12:57] mr_forbes_95: he will do it if he has all the other cases against  him

[4:13:34] Sssaap: was about to, too, when i went to buy food. but man, those were just too big. they were like 600g. but looked soooo good
[4:13:39] Lilliphus: the only basic bitch move is covering a steak in a1 sauce til you can't taste it
[4:13:45] Nightbot: Come join the discord and fill up the ranks! https://discord.gg/PMrxK3F

[4:21:13] Duc170: W
[4:21:16] FastEddeh: W
[4:21:23] buddha_hands: I think there's ways you could do it, especially with i.e. judge permission
[4:21:24] Cardslapper: A name points toward more possible criminal activity
[4:21:26] LilMaGooby: It allows for investigation on who is stealing cop guns anyway
[4:21:28] Kahr102: statue of limitations the issue on time?
[4:21:30] SpilledNuts: the name seems a lot more fun for everyone
[4:21:31] Axcennts: Yoink the name charge him anyway KEKW the timing is just unfortunate for this guy
[4:21:33] FastEddeh: can't say its not in good faith you still have a day to investigate
[4:21:39] Dawgs_: is the SoL the same for all crimes ?
[4:21:39] victiii25: but how would u know if the name is not bs
[4:21:49] WhosHumble: and then the name is just eugene and we all get a laugh
[4:21:52] plawpsruby: And kian still able to make it to the wedding, so best of both worlds
[4:22:00] xMistressMayhem: @WhosHumble AAAA
[4:22:12] drewhole: if theyre pending before the 30 days it dont matter if it is passed the 30days
[4:22:24] swindel90: Yeah Eugene is scarryyyyyy
[4:22:34] melandru_: can you get a name and charge him anyways if the name is not believable
[4:22:37] buddha_hands: it's actually shocking to me that it's not a plant situation lmao hopefully he provides more than a name.. text history, anything
[4:22:43] Kahr102: yea but wouldnt new evidence extend the " 30 days"
[4:22:56] JAYYCRKS: fuckin Eugene man
[4:23:01] notthatlizardguy: Eugene has killed more than 1 billion romans. He has reason to be terrified
[4:23:01] LilMaGooby: Then you have enough to push for a subpoena on their finances just to see if he's being honest
[4:23:05] omascas: it has to get out if he says it, everyone knows he's here by now
[4:23:07] its_alae: @buddha_hands he said theres none
[4:23:08] FastEddeh: if you get a statement on record you could possibly use it in a future charge if it gets pressed against the name he give?
[4:23:12] MiniSlurpeee: of course its eugine lmao
[4:23:14] swindel90: thats not a thing
[4:23:17] WhosHumble: unless its a warrant they can't
[4:23:21] buddha_hands: how could JSON do this PepeHands
[4:23:23] omascas: plus cornwood was on the raid and he can't shut up
[4:23:24] Kahr102: didnt they do rico on 2.0?
[4:23:27] skinnylegend000: the weight of giving the name means more for the RP than a possible made up server rule timeline
[4:23:31] plawpsruby: Always bet on eugene
[4:23:31] LansuEV: WOT
[4:23:39] mr_forbes_95: yeah new evidence should extend to pending investigations
[4:23:39] MiniSlurpeee: if ramee was his lawyer it would be eugene lmao
[4:23:40] FlameReetardantPanda: the only thing I can k of was Fey "waiving" it for the serial assaults and killings thing
[4:23:41] lost_minotaur: Divine Intervention
[4:23:44] Death6707: How could Mel Rickenbacker do this spbTy
[4:23:46] char69: and he would of got away with it too if it weren't for you dang kids
[4:23:47] Axcennts: and then under Eugene's mask it would be Jayzon Polam classic
[4:23:50] newby_lt: Scooby-doo style
[4:23:59] reddddb: he can voluntarily give up statue of limitations
[4:24:00] omascas: and if you checked the stream, you'd find out eugene was myth all along
[4:24:02] Tanishq__s: its always Eugene or Jason Polam LUL
[4:24:04] Its_ven: most of the devs had no statue in 3.0
