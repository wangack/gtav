[6:25:18] big_joe_show: so i take it gemma won the appeal to get cdl back?
[6:26:39] MeggidoMuneblaze: illegal search, illegal arrest, spent time in jail, lost wages, pain and suffering, etc

[6:34:06] AngelWolfwood: for mdw\
[6:34:19] SirBabelt: You say that now, but what if you spot a PD vehicle with a tire on the curb?
[6:35:11] MeggidoMuneblaze: with how often tow laws change, they should just give a mdw to the tow lot
[6:35:16] Chiracho: OMEGALUL they fuckin did aswell. that's hilarious
[6:35:36] MeggidoMuneblaze: oh thats a good change

[6:41:16] Fastburn_: Was playing Lethal Company, what'd I miss?
