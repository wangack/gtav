[0:50:56] robotbumpiss: !thickfacade
[0:50:56] Moobot: @robotbumpiss In my opinion, this is one of Mike's worst streams. It's boring, and his Jeb voice gets old quick. These days streaming has progressively made him more of a generic youtuber who screams and puts on a thick facade. Mike used to be reserved (yet tense and great at telling things how they were with subtlety) And I thought that made him special.
