[1:10:43] Maca_13: eu ping never gonna get it lol
[1:10:57] NoLastChance: the devs who wrote this didnt think someone can trick it so easily with their system clock?
[1:11:13] dark16sider: This is worst than random
[1:11:47] ghutta: yeah one dude had 12 seconds faster timer than other people and could snipe it KEKW
[1:12:12] swankytiger942221: @ghutta yeah well the rich get richer
[1:12:14] NoLastChance: i can just go now in my system clock and put it 5 seconds earlier. good luck proving I exploited.
[1:12:22] dark16sider: Set your date to 500BC and grab all EZ
[1:12:43] StreamElements: Don't forget to resub Ogey https://www.twitch.tv/subs/nidas

[1:12:52] torxpzzz: Hii chatt Hii mr nidass waaaduuppp HeyGuys HeyGuys HeyGuys
[1:13:37] yeslewd: peepoHey
[1:13:53] ghutta: tbh i usually set time manually without the automatic shit and depending on the automatic time server it probably differs by seconds sometimes. just a bad implementation if that's the case
[1:15:48] Chriss332211: all the systems seem first come first serve
[1:15:51] ghutta: jewelery another sniping game KEKW
[1:16:19] ghutta: a hacking mini game and the highest score gets the contract would be pog

[2:04:04] Aptness: thats cooked
[2:04:26] yeslewd: aint that power gaming?
[2:04:28] monkyfat: get yall's CPS up
[2:05:26] TropicalToucan: If people had the BUTC and enough computers with hq they would take every single one
[2:06:54] hadrian76: I’d imagine a lot of na groups are waking up to get the eu ones too
[2:07:12] yeslewd: How much is the contract 50 butt?
[2:07:45] LegendOfAiur: cops have to pick a shift so why not crims, not a bad idea
[2:08:05] Dierseus9: they just need to vary the cooldown times so its not exactly 2 weeks
[2:08:20] Dierseus9: have a bit of randomness
[2:08:21] JimLaw: yeah, surely servers always full right?
[2:08:25] Aptness: what if contracts were auction based and unique if you already possessed one
[2:08:45] tolluu: mhm
[2:08:47] gengarfunkel: Wouldn't a lottery system just make it fair? Luck of the draw
[2:09:18] Aptness: at the same time though if they're bidding more, wouldnt it make the contract worth less if the price was to high?
[2:09:26] Tokenias: Even limiting it to 1 per person per week just means that another person from the group will click it, would need to be a server rule don't think you can code that
[2:09:36] Tokenias: I mean you can but you can get around it
[2:09:37] yeslewd: limit per hq app
[2:09:55] yeslewd: but then u can have multiple pcs
[2:09:57] yeslewd: Shrug
[2:10:03] Subo_ignorethispart: queue system maybe? if ur 2nd in queue on 1hr cd job you know you will get it in 2hrs
[2:10:10] Aptness: ya it's a bit of a snowball vs cost effectiveness
[2:10:36] realitijd24: mhm  yeah
[2:11:29] TropicalToucan: I feel like that exact scenario would happen. Just multiple hq to cover all timezones and all cool downs so they can hit a job everyday
[2:11:59] TropicalToucan: It should somehow locked to state id
[2:11:59] sykus322: just change your pc time and youll have plenty of jobs BurnEvidence
[2:12:08] TropicalToucan: EZ ^
[2:12:26] xandermaan: there's also the problem with local time differences between players, or is that another discussion entirely?
[2:12:43] StreamElements: Socials: Discord - https://discord.gg/nidas | Twitter - https://twitter.com/nidastwitch
[2:12:46] Tokenias: next update NP will setup blizzards raid reset
[2:13:04] Aptness: could the unique per group work though? can only have 1 per crew? it would at least cause groups to create a 2nd HQ group
[2:13:20] yeslewd: Wait so NP takes ur PC Time?
[2:13:33] yeslewd: Isnt it better to have server time and just an option to pick timezone in hud?
[2:14:09] Hinatainn: Zaceed got it times 10secs faster. JP called him cheatcode. lol
[2:14:37] sykus322: blizzard instance id lockout would make perfect sense here tbh
[2:14:54] realitijd24: Aware
[2:15:43] dyll3: Yea I'm not saying who but some crews were like 5 seconds ahead of 4head  and ming
[2:15:43] DarthNidus: Or you can bid on contract
[2:15:43] hippieh8rlol: Butcoin bidding might be best
[2:15:46] Dierseus9: yeh there are issues with each solution
[2:15:48] sykus322: yeah all groups can give it a try instead of being throttled by massive groups that has 20+ people doing them all the second they are open
[2:15:48] tolluu: ye NA times was very funny to watch with all the malding going on bec of the time difference problem
[2:15:58] 911_raj: May be just remove the time thing and everything at random times
[2:16:00] MercilesssShark: @Nidas did u guys get the refund on the 50btc u lost on the first laundro
[2:16:10] Aptness: ya it's early in 4.0 and a new system, I'd imagine the devs are working on improvements for later implementations
[2:16:16] GoutOfWar: Bartpls
[2:16:36] yeslewd: classic
[2:16:48] hippieh8rlol: 4 head felt weird asking for a refund
[2:17:14] Dierseus9: @hippieh8rlol that 4head guilt PepeLaugh

[2:31:15] Aptness: multiboxers in WoW and on the HQ app NotLikeThis
[2:31:19] taylomic: They could just let everyone apply and dole them out randomly like the S+ boosts in 3.0
[2:31:37] 2hopp: its like in every game someone will have PID over someone elses connection and will get first input
[2:31:39] Maniac1994: Brb moving next door to the server

[3:39:03] WoodzCS: Its hard to say, thats why I wanna talk to more ppl about it, imo the lead performance was Oscar nominating (possibly), but the script was really ass IMO
[3:39:06] Pongchamp64: is it out yet?
[3:39:33] WoodzCS: Like the music and everything is epic as hell ofc, but idk it didnt do an amazing job of highlighting the person he was, it more just showcased the music and what that stood for

[5:59:07] punishedkai: i have no other memory of that night because i was completely gone
[5:59:24] NemisizZ: shit stinks like pine as well
[5:59:29] FideICastro_: @mavmar it literally tells you on the bottle not to drink it straight
[5:59:38] Krokzter: I've had very smooth gin, and you usually mix it with some kinda of soda so it adds to it
[5:59:47] punishedkai: nidasPEEPOV

[6:05:11] SkaldFKACC: yea, like ''thanks for increasing volatility, you fools''. lol
[6:05:22] Krokzter: the top 7 of the s&p are so inflated that I'm worrying the entire economy is riding on those 7
[6:05:25] PicklesDippedInRanch: mans said profitable
[6:05:29] PicklesDippedInRanch: talking about $100
[6:05:31] PicklesDippedInRanch: KEKW

[6:06:01] FideICastro_: $100 x 100 is a big number though
[6:06:05] ro666ert: should think % not amount imo
[6:06:15] Tokenias: I'm waiting for Nidas' next stonk masterclass before I enter the market
[6:06:36] Ererior: yeah, don't think about it as 'earning' money, think about it as 'life experience'

[6:11:49] gostonko: i told them fatboi
[6:11:49] EnticingKey: Realistically how long do you think it would take you to learn to fly a helicopter
[6:11:50] gostonko: hehe
[6:11:59] PicklesDippedInRanch: ReallyMad @gostonko
[6:12:09] timbres: @EnticingKey He never ever would be able to
[6:12:09] carrioncorps: @EnticingKey 5 years ? idk thats an uneducated guess
[6:12:17] Krokzter: @EnticingKey an afternoon
[6:12:27] PicklesDippedInRanch: a good couple hours
[6:12:34] Ererior: 2 minutes?
[6:12:34] bonedead: like 3 hours prob
[6:12:36] carrioncorps: mhm
[6:12:38] Tokenias: If Bill Burr can fly a helicopter anyone can
[6:12:40] divandesalon: to rob a house u just need a big truck
[6:12:41] PicklesDippedInRanch: flying = get off the ground and can land right
[6:12:43] StreamElements: Don't forget to resub Ogey https://www.twitch.tv/subs/nidas
[6:12:47] wst512: you could maybe learn to start it after a week
[6:12:49] carrioncorps: heli licence to fly wherever you want n shit
[6:12:55] EnticingKey: Yes confidently
[6:13:02] timbres: They don't let babies fly helicopters
[6:13:07] carrioncorps: timbres KEKW
[6:13:22] Ererior: @timbres they dont in ur country?!
[6:13:25] mana90: my dad did it in 7 weeks back in the german army
[6:13:26] mariuspure: Nidas have you heard of ultra light weight helicopter license
[6:13:27] EnticingKey: Fair enough
[6:13:29] PicklesDippedInRanch: Marines take courses before and all that stuff but they go through like 6 hours to actually get in, get up in the air, move sideways a bit, then land
[6:13:31] EnticingKey: 1 day
[6:13:37] NemisizZ: more, 100hrs isnt really that much
[6:13:38] PicklesDippedInRanch: and most of those guys aren't rocket scientists KEKW
[6:14:06] carrioncorps: i assume its more dangerous for other people is all
[6:14:10] Aptness: i think you're underestimating what can go wrong though and knowing what to do
[6:14:10] divandesalon: it was 1000 hpurs of civil jet before my bro could pilot a military jet
[6:14:11] PicklesDippedInRanch: couple hours after you watch the courses and stuff 100%
[6:14:12] bonedead: have you heard of the Calradian empire
[6:14:48] BotDoris: ur like a lowrider/boat
[6:14:50] carrioncorps: have you heard of the tradgedy of darth plagious the wise? Hmm
[6:14:53] PicklesDippedInRanch: Hmm
[6:14:57] gostonko: Hmm
[6:15:03] timbres: Hmm
[6:15:18] NemisizZ: thats also 100% easier
[6:15:33] PicklesDippedInRanch: I'd imagine 100 hours to be skilled at it, but way less to just lift off a couple times and land Shrug
[6:15:36] punishedkai: i need to start doing flight lessons to fufil my grandpa's dream
[6:15:41] Mavmar: i bet my alcoholic could do it faster
[6:15:43] NemisizZ: that stays airborne without you doing anything, a heli dont do that
[6:15:44] Ripper_CQ: In a helicopter you have to use both feet and both hands,
[6:16:04] carrioncorps: KEKW
[6:16:10] PicklesDippedInRanch: Shrug 2 weeks basically thats doable
[6:16:14] carrioncorps: you took 101 hours? fucking noob!
[6:16:23] wst512: 100 hours flight time is massive
[6:16:30] divandesalon: drummer then helicopter pilot
[6:16:31] Aptness: being tossed a stick when the helicopter is already in the air really is brain dead
[6:16:34] Krokzter: considering driving is really easy and I had mandatory 30 hours, I'd say helicopter is more than 100
[6:17:09] timbres: Heli licenses require 35 hours of ground training and 35 in air
[6:17:10] Ripper_CQ: PLA I think?
[6:17:11] NemisizZ: 200hrs then u would be able to do it comfortable i think
[6:17:14] PicklesDippedInRanch: for ultralight vehicles
[6:17:32] divandesalon: 20 hours only in france that's why we drive like shits
[6:17:33] Aptness: @NemisizZ most pilots are solo after 30h avg
[6:17:35] PicklesDippedInRanch: thats why some areas in florida people have those small aircrafts in their backyards KEKW
[6:18:05] dimberg: rmm jonas rattar flygplan i sim utan träning 😎
[6:18:46] carrioncorps: pumpa

[6:21:24] Krokzter: if I can fly helis on wasd I can do it with proper controls
[6:21:26] Aptness: @NemisizZ no, you're required to have a 45 hour minimum. 30 dual and 15 PiC
[6:21:35] NemisizZ: but my point is flying in one thing, but flying comfortable is a whole different ballpark
[6:21:36] Ripper_CQ: You have to think about air law and all that stuff too
