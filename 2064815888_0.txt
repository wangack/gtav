[2:43:54] LastANBU: hi teeperson
[2:43:59] rien_d: the trick is to learn to be ok not being in a relationship. doing your thing, getting a hobby that you like (that's preferably a social ordeal). and then, people will notice you're happy, and will want to be around you. and that's how you meet people
[2:44:06] LittleTwurtle: hihi anbu
[2:44:20] kittisack11: i have the flu right now too
[2:44:23] mcDeRose: i should get some milk for my oreos

[2:47:09] rien_d: @UnselfishTwo968 there's time. this time in your life is about practice, not about the end result. which includes the "getting ok with not being in a relationship" part. relationships work best when they're a bonus, not an urgent longing
[2:47:12] Ho_Lee_Sit: lethal if there is a acorn
[2:47:33] Crazyman114: I hate it so much...Stream is not watchable. Voice changers like this should be used to disguise your voice for privacy...
[2:47:39] samzun97: @ho_lee_sit too soon
[2:47:47] UnselfishTwo968: @Crazyman114 Then Dont Watch The Stream
[2:48:04] UnselfishTwo968: It Ain't Watchable Don't Watch It yeeShrug  Simple
[2:48:07] Crazyman114: Yeah, will turn it off soon.
[2:48:31] Crazyman114: But I love this stream and I like Kris, so I wanted to pass the feedback, which I believe to be appropriate.
[2:48:38] Ho_Lee_Sit: hmm if my twitch scuff? i can only see one msg unless it is chat settings?
[2:48:52] IvyHarvie: scuff

[2:50:47] cen0wy: i cant wait fo the day, he forget to turn on the voice changer KEKW
[2:50:51] sanzonw: We should all be able to speak our minds, sort of when Kris choice is recognizable is kinda cringe but I it doesn't bother me and it sounds treat when it's in the low register also If Kris uses his choice it becomes another self insert we already see Jay's personality being diluted already..
