[2:50:14] dodgersfan09918: Hi cray how’s your day going today?
[2:50:20] CrimsonCarnotaurus: Canon means that it is officially recognised in the franchise's continuity. You can like and dislike something all you want but it has no bearing on the concept
[2:50:23] danikat15: whats the background music? sounds good
[2:50:23] NosAU: AngelThump
[2:50:28] shadowless_warrior: u mean too far?
[2:50:30] mrpepega06: reminds me of what they did to joel in last of us
[2:50:31] rsyncd: Marvel did the smart thing and created different "Earth"s for different comic series so you can always say "But that's Earth-464"
[2:50:49] the_real_monkeey: What happened to click

[2:51:42] ErnieSKZ: let them be creative
[2:51:45] shadowless_warrior: in my cray canon he kissed bazz in paris KEKW
[2:51:49] mrpepega06: u gon play the jedi survivor?

[2:52:09] ExGuavo_: Shruge

[2:52:15] VioIe: is knights of the old republic canon? cause if its not they can blow me
[2:52:19] NinjaBossDC: RIPBOZO
[2:52:21] oxygenIess: canon only really makes sense with clearly parody clips (being made for the lols) or when something is removed for a good reason.
[2:52:21] not_real_mustard: when are you playing palwprld
[2:52:22] Nightbot: soon.

[2:53:04] iZF1zzy: george lucas said himself some aspects of kotor are canon
[2:53:05] shadowless_warrior: canon is to just keep a consistency
[2:53:08] ughitssophie: FeelsDankMan
[2:53:13] mrpepega06: i still can’t believe the kotor remakes been canned
[2:53:18] nukelance: they should make a series of knights of the old republic
[2:53:18] oxygenIess: canon being a baseline makes sense, but not forcing it on people
[2:53:22] NinjaBossDC: Shruge
[2:53:25] frenzy_750: people find anything to complain about to be honest
[2:53:31] its_c29: me with every show I watch just ignore the negative parts lol
[2:53:37] applekingtree56: just believe what you want to believe
[2:53:39] VioIe: scrap the sequel trilogy from canon and make a kotor trilogy
[2:53:44] DarkGreatBlade: @Crayator what do you think about all the drama with the rey movie
[2:53:53] domi30: but why can you not take that game as a one off and just enjoy the game

[2:54:11] DarkGreatBlade: kotor is some of the best story lines is in all of sw
[2:54:12] rsyncd: Marvel having the concept of different "Earth"s make inconsistent storylines more plausible but it still can get confusing
