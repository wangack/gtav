[8:40:03] Eemelii: get good mhm
[8:40:08] Nemo7: Makes the chase more intense when the cop car is better imo
[8:40:10] AloofMango: Baseg but true
[8:40:18] ibaknam: i mean the cops whip out chargers for anything now... a cvpi is a rare sight
[8:40:46] xdSilly: monkaW the avengers
[8:40:49] SlyDolphin: mhm
[8:40:50] cuzo_II: only seems like that because the cop cars handle much better than in 3.0
[8:40:57] beckdog12121: Avengers!!!!
[8:40:58] MrKing8: maybe have 2 cop cars, one balanced for good drivers and another for bad drivers. so both get capped..
[8:41:03] Squidmyster: Then they fired half of them lol
[8:41:11] Eemelii: PepeLa we
[8:41:15] AloofMango: shift 1 monkaS

[8:42:04] Eemelii: edenKOT
[8:42:10] SlyDolphin: edenKOT
[8:42:12] Blank27: @dtick85 you mean that smoking cop car going 150?
[8:42:13] chanchan_9: with swaps though because there are 8 cop cars to one crim car. the percentage doesn‚Äôt map up
[8:42:14] bigbean24: there was very little swaps in 2.0 because of less car damage imo
[8:42:17] xAli1551: edenKOT
[8:42:33] AloofMango: there was really great swap spot I saw today that i havent see before
[8:42:38] itz_IMAN: car damage increases swaps imo
[8:42:42] AloofMango: at red garage EvilGiggle
[8:42:51] dtick85: @blank27 any of the ones he's stolen...
[8:42:52] thatrealarab: crims get only 6 to do a job cops should be the same
[8:42:56] xdSilly: swaps will always happen Shrug
[8:42:56] domantre: edenKOT

[8:43:06] szostek_: edenKOT
[8:43:12] AloofMango: @thatrealarab what? OMEGADANCEBUTFAST
[8:43:14] lucho724_: 80% of plans also involve swapping
[8:43:26] SuperTrooperJoe: lmao
[8:43:29] lucho724_: without swaps, most jobs would be "just drive"
[8:43:31] beckdog12121: also each situation is different for the swaps
[8:43:32] chanchan_9: limit the amount of cops in a chase and have rules on cops fixing cars
[8:43:34] xdSilly: monkaW
[8:43:39] een1Z: 6 seaters pls
[8:43:39] cionus: more parallels?
[8:43:44] dtick85: Cop car being faster makes sense. Just not a fan of not being able to take the tracker off
[8:43:48] Scantrawn: air 1 sntSuffer
[8:43:54] fragly_: Aware air 1
[8:43:56] thatrealarab: yeah you dont want swaps but when you have 10 cop cars chasing thats BS
