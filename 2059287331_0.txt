[7:37:08] Leowulf: i dont agree with Flash's logic about the recipees... to say harry is doing it the "slow" way because he's trying random shit is just wrong since technically the flash method of trying all the same elements each time is also just 1 possible random combination
[7:37:12] iTzRichardzzz: digging through the sewer and then eating French fries without washing your hands harrRIP
[7:37:35] masterswordsmen23: haha

[7:39:13] BenzBetz: Oh okay
[7:39:19] difficultsleep3r: Flash is already better than avg.  He has a good starting point.
[7:39:29] mrdumpling420: You are in 2 deep @harry lol
[7:39:30] madferret10: have chat throw you a random combination everytime and ban them if they give you a bad 1 LUL

[7:55:54] lolSMCballs: id rather watch paint dry than watch all 8 ads twitch is trying to shove down my throat
[7:55:54] turbodyrock: thats what im thinking he still holds up all this time
[7:55:59] geo_logic_: wonder if it cools down a lot slower now

[7:56:19] SergeGray: Not all the way to paleto, but maybe from the city to sandy
[7:56:21] mr_funkylicious: @harry i did the math for you. Your average price is 97.24. Lets assume u pay 10% selling fee, then it is 106.97. Bases on the current price of the stock u made 2.28 $. That results in a profit of 187$ total.
[7:56:22] bcbray: becoming immune to sewers, car not overheating, it’s a harrWarry kind of day
[7:56:30] Leowulf: goes up halfway as soon as he says something about it xd

[7:57:25] difficultsleep3r: NOOO
[7:57:44] DabberDooo: @Terrozer nwa and most of death row are better imo. biggie got popular cuz of the pac drama
[7:57:50] lolSMCballs: 0 proof alcohol KEKW that shit is water lmao
[7:57:58] DabberDooo: dont get me wrong tho, still some jammers
[7:58:02] mr_funkylicious: if it rises to 120 u made a total of around 1 grand profit
[7:58:08] Terrozer: like i love biggie, but he was in the presence of the greatest
[7:58:10] prayge666: shit water KEKW

[7:59:00] mechabananas: Yea you know whats crazy Pac and Biggie can both be goats. its wild to call biggie mid though
[7:59:12] presentradio: hot take my least favorite tupac track
[7:59:24] Foamed: What people don't take into consideration with rap is that the bar has heightened significantly since the 90s. It has also never been easier and faster to make music than it is today so there's much more crap out there in comparison.
[7:59:24] mr_funkylicious: 120 would be 7.46% ROI. not that bad
[7:59:42] xanpippin: is this like m*th where you have to adjust how you make it or is a rep thing
[8:00:02] BigBudB: what if letting it cook for longer increases the alcohol content too
[8:00:08] c000ls: wonder if you can drink it yourself lol
[8:00:23] Leowulf: @xanpippin you adjust the recipe
[8:00:29] DabberDooo: @mechabananas lebron and jordan both cant be goats. only have one
[8:00:31] xanpippin: word
[8:00:46] BigBudB: yeah for sure
[8:01:03] mechabananas: @Foamed people also use this to make the false assumption that rappers were better back then, even though we have a huge amount of talent out there today
[8:01:04] BigBudB: work on one thing at a time im just cooking about it
[8:01:05] wi11_the_thri11_: @DabberDooo You're right, because its Kobe.
[8:01:05] lolSMCballs: are you noting down the formula and prices or just winging it?
