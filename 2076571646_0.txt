[0:18:01] franktrain_: its like they are arguing as if this is the appeal and not civil
[0:18:17] BionicFireman: I think Rossa is probably trying to get Steele to perjure himself

[1:47:53] volazal: monkaS the law-time continuum will break
[1:47:55] Crosis86: exactly lorem
[1:47:59] Raedosz: so bad charges should just be forgiven is his arguement?
[1:48:04] Mosaic78: he’s saying that if unlawful police activity is taken to court. cops won’t be effective.
[1:48:09] BionicFireman: He's arguing to the way we are establishing our case law and what we've been encouraging people to do, interesting.
[1:48:28] Wool_story: Not to the tower, 250 goes to state and tow gets like 5 bucks a tow?
[1:48:30] mystic_drewman: And with the law changing so  often I see not knowing all details
[1:48:30] bgdrew: what fabric do you think Justice is made of. is it burlap or a traditional cotton?
[1:48:32] BionicFireman: Although you kinda do still need probable cause to charge
[1:48:49] expertdolphin1884: can't you use that argument for ANY civil suit against police then?

[1:49:04] Herman_Miller_1114: Funny.
[1:49:09] J4YFIN: umm... rossa c'mon KEKW
[1:49:09] Aegrusx: Its a good argument, but not for this case IMO
[1:49:16] Wool_story: @Herman_Miller_1114 This is a really weird subject, it's  forcing acknowledgement of the whole "10 months isn't real"
[1:49:18] Crosis86: if officers do bad arrests they should be worried about the blow back
[1:49:19] the_minds_i: rossa needs to lock it in
[1:49:36] expertdolphin1884: KEKW
[1:49:38] KikiG4mer: oop
[1:49:38] Wool_story: I personally hope it doesn't get acknowledged any further, because it's this huge glaring 'we know it's not real we don't talk about it' in GTA
[1:49:54] Herman_Miller_1114: @wool_story yeah mentioning it like that is the weird part. everyone knows that the judge won’t give 10 IRL months of towing.
[1:49:57] rachelkachel: there's a time dilation field in the prison, it's not that complicated occamSmile
[1:49:57] Loremipsum21: He didn't have PC to push the charges and arrested Jordan because he didn't want his car towed. Hardly good faith.

[1:53:55] Aqua_Motif: where are the case laws? I don't recall seeing that section when i was viewing the MDW as a civvie
[1:53:58] chokebot17: @Alterec If you've been pronouncing it like code-ifying you aren't wrong. Its commonly pronounced both ways
[1:54:03] Raedosz: does the judge decide if the cop is being sued or the department?
[1:54:24] Herman_Miller_1114: you’re all pronouncing it wrong. it’s coo-dify
[1:56:01] the_minds_i: but probencrux skipped steps
[1:56:42] chokebot17: Also wasn't it stated that Jordan saw DJ buying food and chatting with another officer?
[1:56:54] jaxkmurphy: I mean I think that argument would be better if it wasn’t outside something like a fast food place
[1:57:17] Gerryv753: And in the last case there was no report on what the emergency was and they couldn't say what it was
[1:57:19] aprilmoxt: aprilmoxt subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months! 
[1:57:21] jaxkmurphy: like if they were randomly parked on a street yea sure you could question how do you know it’s not an energy but at something like a food place
[1:57:51] praxiee: KEKW when is that sub sound from
[1:58:32] Gerryv753: And the state can decide what to do about it internally too
