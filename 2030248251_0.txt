[7:42:11] KoradKPL: elgato 4k can't get more than 60hz if you have 4k, at 2k you have 144hz i think
[7:42:13] tehtearz: It says it does 1440p 144hz
[7:42:14] TysonGking: 1080 if you want higher hz
[7:42:16] StageName: at 4k maybe not
[7:42:17] PhantomRogue: the stream pc will up/down scale the resolution on the Gaming PC

[7:43:18] eindride66: AV1?
[7:43:19] ChasRover: av1 Pog
[7:43:21] legoliket: AV1
[7:43:21] SqualkerAoD: 60 hrz is 60 frames per second 4k video which is the capture standard for 4k videos

[7:43:52] alwiro: for AV1 you will need a 40. not enabled on 30
[7:43:52] IchiFi: The multi encode is different from av1
[7:43:53] StageName: no you can get a cheaper one
[7:43:56] Sqwashtv: yeah probably @Kyle for the encoder
[7:43:57] zaknefein1: no
[7:43:57] Gyroshark: AV1 needs the newest series, intel amd or nvidia
[7:43:57] AdamPrtn: Because to do that you need a 40 Series to handle it, it's just NVIDIA being NVIDIA
[7:44:01] teknikvt: 4090 TI yea, get that one peepoGiggles
[7:44:01] IchiFi: No you have H265
[7:44:03] KoradKPL: get 4070 for stream pc
