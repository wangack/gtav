[0:35:44] Dakks97: KEKL I remember a certain game required them to hide the puzzles
[0:35:46] AJSHELL1: I think Hololive requires permissions from the company written specifically for Hololive
[0:35:46] Eamil: @manteau they can yeah, FF14 just puts a streaming policy on their web site so you don't have to reach out to square enix

I started doing Judo again. I feel much better mentally and lost 40 lbs in 6 months. It's been massive. You get the physical exercise AND socialization (I work from home and went 2 months without talking to another human face to face). Getting some sort of physical hobby has literally saved my life.

[1:18:16] jcara514: Cheer500 unfortunately I’m at the point where my caffeine tolerance is high enough that if I don’t have any caffeine I’m sleepy during the day (tried fighting it but college life and going to the gym at 8 AM requires caffeine for me)
[1:18:17] FreeDzy5: playing sports once a week definitely helps break of my funks.
[1:18:20] Eloiir: like get a dog to have an obligation to get out of the house few times a day

[1:41:04] 5teponmemommy: people are sheep
[1:41:04] VolenoVehro: It's smart of them, but it sucks.
[1:41:05] dangerous_ber: I smoked for 20 years, then 2 years ago switched to the vape. I felt the health benefits almost instantly. However I definitely vape more than I smoked. I will sit at my home desk working and vape almost constantly whereas I would have to go psychically outside to smoke every couple hours
[1:41:06] Weeyew: Clueless

[1:41:34] NODZZ: If the stacks of various ciggy brands behind the counter at stores is any indicator, some won't change for a long time
[1:41:37] VolenoVehro: Little bit of poison A, little bit of poison B.
[1:41:38] swordsmenjay: this isn’t your FATHERS cigs, TRY VAPE KIDS
[1:41:39] Warboss_Gegguz: @kaiser_fecalfunny I mean I prefer edibles.
[1:41:40] SvenSurmont: Vaping is the same thing as smoking normal cigarettes, the only difference is the smell and the time of getting you or being unalive

[1:43:05] taylor2electricboogaloo: @OwlOfAvery probably not that big of an issue if you aren't huffing that on the daily
[1:43:10] Duiof: I mean, producing E cigs gotta be easier and cheaper then growing tobacco and all that shit
[1:43:10] SweetTea421: Sadge hooray big tobacco Sadge
[1:43:13] VolenoVehro: The guy spinning wind into gold, now that did happen on Shark Tank

[2:21:35] otokonokotron: i would if it rained
[2:21:35] dabe2: their pathing is really bad, so it's better to leave it open
[2:21:36] Heisuisui: theyre lucky they even get beds Madge
[2:21:36] Lukatroopa: mine sleep outside
[2:21:36] darthketojan: not sure I haven’t played it

[2:21:38] Tsuyoshi1345: firstly yes but i build them a little house later in the game
[2:21:38] tentativechemist: That seems gross. They should sleep outside.
[2:21:38] Danteroth: i only let the wiseguys inside
[2:21:38] darthchewee: I was building a second story hut to maybe move the beds up there and free up space
[2:21:39] Khrono_Hammer: I found the big guys would get stuck in enclosures, so they sleep outside
[2:21:42] Shannara360: My friend lets them sleep inside. LUL
[2:21:43] ImSurfinBird: They ain't paying rent

[2:21:49] NimrodWildfire555: I made a huge house, my pals sleep inside... also my ball access thing is inside. But it's real wonky
[2:21:50] humen_shrek: you'd be a real pal to them
[2:21:51] DarthRadonis: also less way to be glitched
[2:21:51] PToastman: Kappa
[2:21:52] FlurryCraft: it can break the pathing being inside the house
[2:21:53] ShopOwner34: no
[2:21:53] Brotah: straight to jail
[2:21:53] DarkFenix2k5: enclosing them is asking for pathfinding making them get stuck
[2:21:54] Marvellix: but why

[2:21:55] Zansuken_X: yeah I made a side housing for my Pals

[2:22:11] FadingZen: they're your pall that's all the good they need
[2:22:16] MooseyDoom: @EmmaGear LUL
[2:22:20] RenTheRock: let them sleep outside, their pathing can f up with things in the way
[2:22:20] darthchewee: Yeah that sheep is not fitting in a door
[2:22:23] BlazingSaddleSores: What if they shit on the floor tho
[2:22:30] Socraman: I dont do that because the MORE you build around your pals zone of sleep and work the most chances they get STUCK in somethin
[2:22:31] robotbumpiss: Talk about a long house geegaClown
[2:22:35] Chess_Piece: get what

[2:33:14] Anfangxs: ... but a trebuchet should be possible NODDERS
[2:33:15] Hunterwar: macgyver did it

[2:34:29] HenceBoldface: A cool thing I like about base building in the game is that you have full access to all your chest resources while in base

[2:45:05] robotbumpiss: Rock needs to be ORIGINAL ReallyMad
[2:45:08] F7Rhyx: as long as proper credit goes to the original artists
[2:45:11] 1994fordexploder: AAA games use premade assets aswell anyway
[2:45:11] Shake_Milky_Way: dota was born this way
[2:45:12] Striker2521: heres a interesting fact for chat
[2:45:15] MonterraByte: AAA devs also use paid assets
[2:45:16] loudwhisperers: Unreal is resurging more like. Their business model is pretty solid and stable
[2:45:17] imtwopie: its good shit

[2:45:23] zzirain: based
[2:45:23] windatar: Any competition to pokemon is good. Pokemon devs have been so lazy for there last few games, this game lighting a fire under pokemons ass is a good thing.
[2:45:24] xCrosschance: That pig just eat a corpse
[2:45:28] imtwopie: Its the open market environment
[2:45:28] DarkFenix2k5: great assets, great great assets
[2:45:30] Sereaphim: AAA games get more expensive riddle with micro transaction and are not as fun
[2:45:30] RenTheRock: real
[2:45:32] Maimorii: ReallyMad no !!!!!!!! Stop that !!!!
[2:45:37] MapleLeaf1: and if people complain just throw a ball at them, capture them, and send them to the mines.
[2:45:37] Striker2521: the Average open world survival game like pal world has the average production cost of 2 Million minimum
[2:45:41] randomizedpasserby: They sold over 5 million copies already, now they can employ as many artists to paint rock as they want
[2:45:41] swordsmenjay: @biglacroix but WHY?!? why is that allowed hahah….
[2:45:41] OsaErisXero: @loudwhisperers don't forget unity cannibalizing their userbase's influence there
[2:45:46] Boximus523: remember that vampire survivors originally was made with purchased assets
[2:45:50] Thoreex: Thoreex subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[2:45:53] Ryudan153: Just don't pull a "A Day Before" and make your entire game off the asset store LUL
[2:45:59] QuinnOfTheWilds: @windatar that's the thing, this barely counts as competition because the gameplay isn't similar at all
[2:46:00] thefugles: rpg makers games have a lot of good games and that was what they were
[2:46:01] robotbumpiss: Can you name him Beeg COCK ?
[2:46:01] coodcoodac: Im studying game dev so if im doing an assignment or a game jam I will get assets online and very rarely make my own
[2:46:03] loudwhisperers: @OsaErisXero That was the catalyst to Unreal taking the throne
[2:46:09] medeusgames: Even every piece of dialog in a game needs someone to work on it
[2:46:09] DarthRadonis: Lets Name him
[2:46:11] Skyrider_9: with 2d games you can buy a whole asset pack for $20 dollars as opposed to paying an entire art team
[2:46:11] blastermasterguy: Well you know what they say, you put a lot of love into a product and usually it'll come out looking and working great.
[2:46:12] Eamil: I think it takes skill on the asset creator's end to make assets that will fit together with other assets visually, and skill on the developer's end to pick assets that combine into a coherent visual style henyaNodder
[2:46:14] RubenSargasm: god he'd be so good in a sandwich
[2:46:14] blankrasp: The chicken yearns for the mines
[2:46:15] chrisalfaiate: Yeah and think about a lot of the quality of life you can quickly pick up items off the floor you can easily drop off things into your box there's a shared use for your resources from your items in your pockets and what your storage has can help you produce things. The actual parts that make a game are good
[2:46:16] Striker2521: those assets are what let smaller devs get big
[2:46:18] DarthRadonis: Call him Chick Fila
[2:46:20] MonterraByte: gamers when the developers don't write every single line of code from scratch in assembly:
[2:46:24] QuinnOfTheWilds: I can almost guarantee TPC won't actually care that much since this doesn't actually play like Pokemon
[2:46:30] snoopingasu: also everyone praying on pokemon's downfall with this game so they actually get their shit together AINTNOWAY
[2:46:40] imtwopie: just wait till people learn about the fact that there's a cobblestone texture thats in nearly EVERY Nintendo 64 game, because it was on an incredibly common Dev assets CD
[2:46:44] Thatguy2502: I think most of the people who are complaining about this game comes from one of two camps. Pokemon stans, and "purists" who don't like indie.
[2:46:53] Sereaphim: @snoopingasu completion is always good

[2:47:05] imtwopie: Hmm
[2:47:06] windatar: @QuinnOfTheWilds As long as people keep comparing it to pokemon, then it doesn't matter if its similar or not. Once thats part of the conversation then its competition. lol.
[2:47:06] Nullctipus: the problem with asset flips is the style is incoherent, kit-bashing is is similar to asset flips, but it actually keeps style the same.
[2:47:07] KingArchlich: Try triangle wall
