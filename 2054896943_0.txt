[2:03:28] Miki3is: I actually had a very similar idea in terms of the trucking, just haven't had time to figure it out in game
[2:04:20] ZoneyZoned: @hjkh123 don’t think its bad for performance people just want to rp up north
[2:04:29] sterowentUS: i mean, trucking sounds like a soothing kind of job. the smart truckers would keep timber companies close

[2:24:21] KlSEMA: I agree
[2:24:29] sterowentUS: like cobalt running out of a room at the roach motel
[2:24:40] GoblinPunch: Getting a big building for a starter business just doesnt make sense unless it has huge finacial backing
[2:24:43] mio_ottawa: I like that... rent is cheaper further away from the city
[2:24:45] MrSym: I think people are slowly starting to understand that you need to push the RP to be provided things, instead of the opposite way around
