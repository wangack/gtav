[1:09:32] JDXL: so that u wont need keys
[1:09:51] JDXL: and if you get the code wrong it zaps you
[1:10:04] miso_misguided: are we talking about NP or Rust rn?
[1:10:13] vcripps: right now to ez to rob a house
[1:10:23] JuhJimmy: lets be 100% honest if you rob a house right now your probably meta as shit
[1:10:29] miso_misguided: imagine you rob someone and move in OMEGALUL
[1:10:34] JuhJimmy: if you rob someone you arent going to know wehre they live
[1:10:36] JDXL: i mean its still in the owners name
[1:10:39] JuhJimmy: or does the key tell you
[1:10:41] Dwin65: no one would take house keys irl tbh
[1:10:41] egwog: squatters rights
[1:10:46] gijn: juhjimmy you can know but its meta
[1:10:54] rheonyn: Just unlock the code lock blueprint mhm
[1:10:57] JDXL: the most they can do is take stuff in the house
[1:11:02] vcripps: rob there house and change the lock and make them pay to be let in
[1:11:02] gijn: that dizzy doesn‚Äôt know yet
[1:11:13] egwog: put a ring camera up
[1:11:25] Frimpy_: what if u just zerg people outside their house with guns and make them give u the key
[1:11:26] initialvlcty: @dizzy build an airlock and get some shotgun traps, make sure they get op
[1:11:26] duch333: ring camera xdd
[1:11:28] JDXL: install rust+ and get a phone notification when youre getting raided

[1:11:41] bonziatv: insta reset
[1:11:42] vcripps: keypad that u need to hack after the key
[1:11:45] miso_misguided: RFID lock that recognizes your phone and opens the door
[1:11:55] kongqu3st: nah you just need to buy a car
[1:12:00] gijn: internal keypad that‚Äôs hackable would be cool
[1:12:04] WabobaW: there was keypads in 3.0
[1:12:04] JuhJimmy: i mean that shouldnt be possible? i mean tehre is a home owner no?
[1:12:12] azdabsttv: can u build hidden rooms and doors?
[1:12:12] gijn: so if they do get in they have to at least hack some keypad to get to the loot
[1:12:17] mitssuwu: more scared about a house in RP than house IRL AINTNOWAY

[1:12:29] whoop_ee: Hmm
[1:12:40] JuhJimmy: i think you are under the impression that this is rust
[1:12:51] Frimpy_: for them to take everything they'd have to spend some time loading it into cars etc?
[1:12:53] gijn: have you played wow hardcore?
[1:12:56] JuhJimmy: why is someone just going to randomly rob a house that they randomly got a key for
[1:12:58] Frimpy_: like it's not just a fast snatch and grab
[1:13:01] yodaHn: os cuh buh ster
[1:13:05] JDXL: just wait for forcewipe
[1:13:18] miso_misguided: or, hear me out, secure your housekey and it's a non-issue
[1:13:20] JuhJimmy: the risk there is way to much for the reward. what if you had literally nothing
[1:13:34] mitssuwu: @JuhJimmy what if.
[1:13:37] initialvlcty: @dizzy just get a gun
[1:13:41] JDXL: ray made a actual rust base for their rp house
[1:13:42] initialvlcty: 4Head
[1:13:44] JuhJimmy: it would be targeted at that point
[1:13:54] JuhJimmy: thats then good rp
[1:14:01] JDXL: mhm
[1:14:08] whoop_ee: mhm
[1:14:17] miso_misguided: i'm listening

[1:16:40] gijn: future will be crazy
[1:16:45] azdabsttv: gives advantage to big Brains imo
