[0:20:11] JoeayIV: and it only relates to people who cook food
[0:20:19] nobodybodon: nakkiWait
[0:20:27] JoeayIV: what secret thing do you do when you cook
[0:20:32] JoeayIV: whats the one thing
[0:20:46] nobodybodon: I turn on the stove
[0:20:50] SputnicWasTaken: wash hands
[0:20:52] youngenman: I put a lid on it
[0:20:53] xjdannylp: It was funny how Harm was so scared by the scorpions and the tarantulas
[0:20:56] nobodybodon: food is shit if you don't do that
[0:20:58] Davser75: Depends highly on the dish in question
[0:20:59] JoeayIV: no no
[0:21:03] ApocAFK: That's my secret cap'n, I never cook ever
[0:21:08] JoeayIV: like
[0:21:14] JoeayIV: your special move
[0:21:15] Jen848: how is cooking something secret? I'm confused
[0:21:36] DJayEnzyme: @JoeayIV i dont measure anything, just throw it in
[0:21:48] youngenman: Low and slow with a lid on it
[0:21:53] nobodybodon: @JoeayIV did you just watch a salt bae video and assume all people who cook are weirdos who think they're anime protagonists?
[0:22:00] xjdannylp: @joeayiv im a chef and restaurant owner how's can I help you
[0:22:06] JoeayIV: i dry fry onions then put butter in and cook em more
[0:22:06] ApocAFK: Looks like they maybe did get a restock on some Hmmm
[0:22:13] JoeayIV: people get real mad when i tell em that
[0:22:16] Davser75: Secret to being sure the food is great is to taste what it is like once in a while while cooking it
[0:22:27] ApocAFK: At least from the last time I saw the list
[0:23:27] porky9537: howdy
[0:23:28] xjdannylp: @joeayiv if you make you food a certain way and others don't like it just ignore them and keep doing what you like
[0:23:36] nobodybodon: @JoeayIV so are you asking what things we do that is objectively wrong and we should stop immediately?
[0:23:52] Jen848: Special move reminds me of salt bae and I don't do anything remotely similar.
[0:23:56] JoeayIV: i know someone who replaces half the water they use for rice with broth

[0:24:11] Jen848: nakkiHappyClap nakkiHappyClap
[0:24:24] DJayEnzyme: @JoeayIV omg i cook rice in a pyrex bowl in the microwave
[0:24:26] nobodybodon: @JoeayIV thats normal
[0:24:28] jimothy64: Most of my cooking "innovation" revolves around trying to insert the most down time into a method.. mobility limitations
[0:24:36] JoeayIV: but not widely known i found out
[0:24:38] Winston_Moriarty: throw salt all over the place like SaltBae ShadyLulu
[0:24:41] nobodybodon: or at least not outrageous
[0:24:48] retrowolf0498: My grandma will make battered chicken, but instead of using standard batter, she uses pancake batter. It's incredible.
[0:25:01] nobodybodon: thats just pilaf
[0:25:05] DJayEnzyme: @retrowolf0498 that sounds pretty good tbf
[0:25:07] nobodybodon: if you add veg
[0:25:22] hellcaster: fried basicly
[0:25:37] retrowolf0498: Similar to fried chicken but you bake it in an oven instead of frying it.
[0:25:44] joxthejoker: I always put extra cheese and cheddar brats in my Mac and cheese
[0:25:46] xjdannylp: One of the line cooks likes to mix sauteed onions and peanut butter
[0:25:59] DJayEnzyme: @xjdannylp chunky or smooth?
[0:26:09] JoeayIV: see
[0:26:11] JoeayIV: secrets!
[0:26:12] youngenman: Is an air fryer just a countertop convection oven?
[0:26:13] retrowolf0498: So closer to breaded chicken.
[0:26:16] JoeayIV: don't gotta be good
[0:26:16] nobodybodon: why would that be a bad combination?
[0:26:17] apairidox: nakkiHello
[0:26:28] nobodybodon: thats just lazy thai food
[0:26:29] JoeayIV: or like the people who add a pinch of cinnamon to every dish regardless if it fits or not
[0:26:38] xjdannylp: @djayenzyme  both i did try it and will never eat it again
[0:27:04] xjdannylp: Just like I love blood pie and many don't.  Damnit now I'm extra hungry
[0:27:31] JoeayIV: that counts!
[0:27:40] nobodybodon: I bet this bozo uses cream to make alfredo sauce
[0:27:43] nobodybodon: Madge
[0:28:07] jimothy64: Oh, also, keep MSG in stock.. and don't be afraid of acid when seasoning
[0:28:21] DJayEnzyme: @jimothy64 LSD?

[0:28:44] xjdannylp: When i make blood pie I use cow and sheep's blood and veal meat with onions carrots panko and dark beer
[0:28:51] nobodybodon: ok I finally thought of an actual tip: use vinegar/pickle juice in your meat brines.
[0:28:58] JoeayIV: ooooo
[0:29:02] JoeayIV: see thats one i heard of before
[0:29:06] JoeayIV: haven't tried it yet
[0:29:21] nobodybodon: Had roast pork last night that was brined with spices and vinegar
[0:29:28] Mister_RebelHD: Rebel Arado Kappa
[0:29:33] nobodybodon: VERY diluted though, a couple tablespoons per cup
[0:29:38] nikki4523: making your own alfredo is so simple but so good
[0:29:52] jimothy64: MSG is your friend, ignore the lies and propaganda
[0:30:01] JoeayIV: reminds me of my friend who brought out a bag of frozen tater tots and made the best tater tots i've ever had
[0:30:01] retrowolf0498: Another one i remember is my dad would make Shake n Bake pork steak bites. It's simple and good.
[0:30:12] JoeayIV: it was just salt and vinegar tater tots
[0:30:34] CatGotYourKeyboard: I've been putting a little maple syrup in my coffee lately. Not a cooking secret but it's really tasty.
[0:30:49] retrowolf0498: Nothing is better than potatoes and salt and vinegar.
[0:30:59] Blunderbusses: that's good money
[0:31:09] Blunderbusses: hunting area is FILLED with trash bags
[0:31:39] retrowolf0498: @catgotyourkeyboard everything is better with a bit of maple flavoring.

[1:56:23] Jen848: oh dear
[1:56:28] nobodybodon: classic richard
[1:56:39] JoeayIV: 25 runs ezpz
[1:56:41] retrowolf0498: Yeager is going to ocean dump him.
[1:57:47] JoeayIV: chat its time
[1:57:50] JoeayIV: im gonna risk it
[1:57:56] JoeayIV: and play league of legends
[1:57:59] retrowolf0498: Don't hurt yourself tonight.
[1:58:03] nobodybodon: RIPBOZO
[1:58:08] JoeayIV: im still hurting
[1:58:16] JoeayIV: but i love tilting people with dumb builds
[1:58:32] JoeayIV: someone got real mad at hybrid MF
[1:58:32] retrowolf0498: If you push it, you're wrists are next.
[1:58:46] JoeayIV: but let me tell you, it was a real good time
[1:59:14] nobodybodon: that ain't stupid
[1:59:15] JoeayIV: bruh i did tank fizz and i got death threats from the enemy team
[1:59:20] nobodybodon: thats just a flex
[1:59:27] Rekonin: The amount of people my ad bard tilts is faaantastic
[1:59:28] JoeayIV: but also hybrid MF works well with the new items this season
[1:59:54] JoeayIV: cuz you can build wonky ap and crit stuff
[2:00:02] nobodybodon: I haven't played in AGES, but when I did fizz was so fucking busted, if you played him well you could build anything
[2:00:12] JoeayIV: he is busted
[2:00:14] Brumorin: Katarina in the 3v3 was toxic af
[2:00:21] JoeayIV: any time i play him im playing tank
[2:00:22] retrowolf0498: League is the second most toxic community only behind CD.
[2:00:26] JoeayIV: the new tank items are ABSURD
[2:00:28] nobodybodon: having played dota since, he plays like a dota hero where all you need are levels, the items are optional
[2:00:29] Rekonin: MF with Malignance?
[2:00:32] JoeayIV: ye
[2:00:33] retrowolf0498: CS*
[2:00:39] JoeayIV: but also like
[2:00:50] DJayEnzyme: @retrowolf0498 nah league more toxic than cs
[2:01:05] JoeayIV: quick blades and the armor pen item that amps dmg against higher health people
[2:01:16] JoeayIV: damage amped by crit and AP
[2:01:20] tfw_badfeel: league would be more toxic if voice chat was as common as counter strike
[2:01:20] nobodybodon: I mostly have GREAT experiences with CS, when I played league people where madge 23/7
[2:01:23] JoeayIV: redonk silly numbers
[2:01:38] retrowolf0498: Counter Strike can go the route of swatting. I haven't heard of League players swatting each other yet.
[2:01:50] nobodybodon: the missing 1 is the 1 in 24 games I won
[2:02:29] Retjudge: Trucker Lamb
[2:02:44] JoeayIV: i mostly got back into it for the arena mode and got addicted again
[2:02:59] JoeayIV: and now i tilt people in arams
[2:03:03] JoeayIV: and its really funny
[2:03:12] nobodybodon: I've got an important question
[2:03:23] nobodybodon: is cho'gath still the same as he was like... 8 years ago?
[2:03:27] JoeayIV: um
[2:03:34] JoeayIV: describe how you would play him
[2:03:38] JoeayIV: cuz i'd say so
[2:03:43] Rekonin: basically, yea
[2:03:46] JoeayIV: his E might be different then you remember
[2:03:46] nobodybodon: cause I stand by the fact that he was the perfect champion and should never be changed
[2:03:59] nobodybodon: AOE spikes on AA?
[2:04:04] JoeayIV: yea but its like
[2:04:11] JoeayIV: 3 attacks now and goes on CD
[2:04:14] JoeayIV: instead of a toggle
[2:04:18] JoeayIV: and does %hp dmg
[2:04:26] tfw_badfeel: i love going full cdr teemo in aram, tilts the heck out of my opponments
[2:04:38] JoeayIV: his ult now can't stack past 6 on minions too
[2:04:42] JoeayIV: dunno when that change was made
[2:05:04] nobodybodon: the max WAS 6 when I played
[2:05:09] nobodybodon: unless I'm missremembering
[2:05:20] belystar: Chat, I've come to terms with the fact I'll never have a stable job. Mostly because I'm uncomfortable around horses.
[2:05:25] JoeayIV: yea his changes were a long long time ago
[2:05:28] JoeayIV: but 8 years is pretty long
[2:05:31] JoeayIV: so i wasn't sure
[2:05:37] Rekonin: the fact they removed oracles, only 'replacing' it with that single TS minion, man... teemo is horrible
[2:06:06] JoeayIV: red trinket start every game vs Teemo
[2:06:18] Rekonin: well, aram
[2:06:22] JoeayIV: ah well
[2:06:23] JoeayIV: yea
[2:06:34] JoeayIV: i wish they would add the item that arena has
