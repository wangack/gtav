[2:13:48] placeholder2154: The safe is important
[2:13:49] dominusmessorem: I think after getting him to his placed she drugged him through the whiskey glass, led him to his bed and the drug made him fall unconscious at the bed, knocking over the vase in the process getting it under his nails. Then she robbed him, took his keys, and got into the safe. Then perhaps he either woke up and caught her forcing her to kill him or she didn't want to leave a witness and killed him, or the drug just straight up killed him and she set up the whole suicide thing.
[2:13:50] jamesboon21: Any lawsuits???

[11:08:31] AllisonMoon_: yeah mike block keeps EVERYONE, even gangsters, in their toes
[11:08:34] Rmehandru: there was much less shooting back then. all risk atm involves shooting unfortunately
[11:08:36] JSHReaper: made things more scary
[11:08:36] tombovard: you aren't tied to the income sadKEK
[11:08:37] dmp1126: or to just set some regulations so that 8 cops dont show up for a grocery store
[11:08:39] Kappsule: back when seeing a class 2 was only on super rare occasions was sick
[11:08:39] Legion732: I think one of the biggest issues with drug pushers getting caught is the fact police are most of the time responding to calls and cant patrol

[11:09:19] cinder_wolves: 3.0 will hopefully add some risk back into the server
[11:09:20] KiIian__: I mean most cops want that as well
[11:09:21] cxxf_: pd gives an inch criminals take a mile. they complained and complained the consequences disappeared
[11:09:23] ka1o5: true, some crimes complain for the next few hours when they get caught then their chats get the same mindset
[11:09:32] pepsiplunge19: I feel like other people say they want risk until they actually get it
[11:09:32] wario163: EU seems to crack down on house robberies, they dont like people speed running houses in SS
[11:09:34] watchSilently: PAYNE ? Pog

[11:09:36] jeannnbean: we only sorta feel that threat with soze and even then he gets called away most of the time sadKEK
[11:09:39] binwater: Everything is the same risk now it feels like

[11:10:00] J0ex117: payne?
[11:10:02] gman100: i think that it's a combo of always shooting now and that they are forced to respond to top priority jobs and more people doing jobs at the same time so they don't have time when Mike Block gets broken out of custody everytime
[11:10:05] tombovard: more slots + more Taco shop Lite mecchanics
