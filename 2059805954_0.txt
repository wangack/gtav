[0:52:36] Faildude: Slacks was more concerned about public opinion than if he broke SOP
[0:52:37] Diaz10gtg: @T3r3nceSkill I guess they will put rules for important ones like u cant hit it if x number of officers are not sign in or something like that

[0:53:40] P51F144: Pitting a car doesnt hurt it anyway
[0:53:40] popcornispoggers: It's crazy that Den gets DAPs for literally doing his job
[0:53:41] trinisavage6: @athasin LUL LUL poor brother man
[0:53:41] osirion1: crims will ahte cops no matter what and civs will ahtes cops if they dont catch crims for robbing
[0:53:43] marlz365: At this rate safest position will be to work on MRPD Reception Desk

[0:53:52] mavericks312: @1captainredbeard1 bro crims actually feel bad for how bad the pd is being held back by slacks and Ruth
[0:53:53] sticks26: It's been 2 months  and pits have injured multiple civilians.. no one got punished. It's is beyond UNFAIR to DAP you cause someone is pushing a lawsuit

[0:54:32] joewelch29: @Deansocool ruby york was right yesterday with saying how if you get dapped then it goes agianst all sops and people wont pit at all anymore
[0:54:33] Thraxton1: Also literally every other officer have done pits way more aggressive than that, you just had insane bad luck
[0:54:33] BDG_parth28: WWW 2 months
[0:54:34] FvmousAce_: Johnson fired?
[0:54:36] SmokeyPumkin: @popcornispoggers right 2 admins
[0:54:36] marlz365: Just waiting for the time for civilians to be injured cause of the criminal, and then you're questioned "Why didn't you PIT earlier?"
[0:54:37] xypher85: SHIT I FORGOT REECES

[0:54:47] Crowzone80: Which officer authorized the pit?
[0:54:53] chmod_R_777: the second one is the one... 3 civs on the sidewalk
[0:54:55] Athasin: @Deansocool They DAP'd you for the G6 thing and that wasn't against SOP either. It's BS honestly
[0:54:56] DjSprayK: @xypher85 milkyway
[0:54:56] BDG_ScubaSteve: @xypher85 that bout would of won too
[0:55:00] MazOnline: slacks needs to give more slack
[0:55:01] P51F144: Pitting a car doesnt hurt it anyway thats the real issue
[0:55:02] Qwrtymuad: surely if a crim is recklessly evading then if they’re pitted, they are liable for consequences
[0:55:05] colinboddy529: cant pit in city AT ALL now probs
[0:55:08] popcornispoggers: It was good police work, just bad luck
[0:55:08] chmbrs: @BDG_Toa676 yuuuuuh, im running deans clip channel cuh
[0:55:09] jgans2: look at the sky box its a long messge
[0:55:09] marlz365: If you didn't PIT and then civilians got injured by the criminal is that still your fault?
[0:55:10] WakeOrSnow: first person to get killed from spiking, somehow Johnson
[0:55:12] smoktrees489: hello whats going on
[0:55:12] trinisavage6: @athasin damn that boi dead dead LUL LUL
[0:55:13] froogo0: Denzel went from go-getter-cop to DAP-catcher. We went from great detective to just support-on-site. We were once the Pit-lord, now we ain’t pitting no more. NotLikeThis Are we still an officer?
[0:55:17] oZeIda: i get its a supposed to be "serious RP" but this is a content server... there has to be some leniency for cops
[0:55:17] Qwrtymuad: so basically don’t put within the city
[0:55:19] BDG_Toa676: @chmbrs jheeez good shit
[0:55:22] yungnams: when u really think abt it, its Johnsons fault for standing there
[0:55:24] mavericks312: having mcnulty as an ally for this situation is good though
[0:55:24] jgans2: 911 07
[0:55:28] greyjulian: @vinnythevman cornwood had a fellow officer as a human shield yesterday during heist negotiations…..
[0:55:29] MDM4ever1986HD: fun fact: Oreos are infact vegan @Deansocool
[0:55:35] brlskyy: 5-0 bro
[0:55:36] supmybrutha: omE
[0:55:39] getanime: I can't wait for BCSO
[0:55:40] redbeerdx: The best case is that they would just take this as a lesson and improve the SOPs from it. Maybe add something about Pitting in areas with civilians
[0:55:49] nuuskis2: @MDM4ever1986HD no milk?
[0:55:58] marlz365: 5-0 Arsenal gonna have as many goals as Den has DAPS, Real recognises real
[0:56:03] mavericks312: @ozeida the captains are so scared of how the pd ended in 3.0 there trying to hard and it’s killing them
[0:56:03] captain_steve_420: Slacks thinks his shit doesnt stink
[0:56:04] Sonicfear: @yungnams Truly Dumb takke.
[0:56:05] k0ldfr33: When a group has 6 getaway cars it's pretty weak to not be able to pit.
[0:56:06] tom_lufc1: 5-0 arsenal
[0:56:07] Crowzone80: the main issue is, cars can survive dozens of hard pits, pit rules are based on real life cars, but game cars dont behave that way
[0:56:07] JumWRLD: 5-0 arsenal let’s go
[0:56:07] vinnythevman: @greyjulian if it were Ruth she would've fired him let's be real
[0:56:10] thricerice1: So denzel getting dap?
[0:56:11] MDM4ever1986HD: @MDM4ever1986HD I guess you could have almond milk or something?
[0:56:12] smoktrees489: what happened
[0:56:17] joewelch29: 5-0
[0:56:20] FunChatt: How can officer do his work when is  worrying about  breaking non SOP PD rules

[0:56:32] Kasvar: o7 only cop on duty soon
[0:56:44] smoktrees489: ruth?
[0:56:44] RyinTwitch: policeSTEER
[0:56:45] Nsan7: I love Ssaab but Slacks is a bit out touch since most of what he has been doing is administrative work for LSPD
[0:56:48] LegoHeadDavy: Whats good dean and chat
[0:56:49] smoktrees489: LUL
[0:56:53] MDM4ever1986HD: policeSTEER
[0:56:54] FilzG: taurus doesnt go more than 130mph?
[0:56:55] LegoHeadDavy: deansoBDG2 deansoBDG2
[0:57:03] Diaz10gtg: @Crowzone80 Im pretty sure the pits are mainly done to try to box or slow down the car nothing more
[0:57:07] chmod_R_777: @thricerice1 Slacks said he would do a vote, captains and Snr Officers
[0:57:09] AnusReaktorMan: Slacks worst captain imo
[0:57:10] Caeros: @crowzone80 tru. less car health would make them stop driving so wreckless too
[0:57:11] smoktrees489: Johnson should be captain
[0:57:16] mavericks312: @nsan7 when’s the last time slack caught a criminal
[0:57:24] captain_steve_420: @chmod_R_777 over 1 dap.
[0:57:27] MazOnline: pit it lol
[0:57:28] vinnythevman: @greyjulian and shiesty as well
[0:57:30] KellBellnf: Nothing you can do unless that truck runs out of gas lol
[0:57:30] froogo0: Thing is, if they DAP Denzel. This time-slot would be losing one of its highly active officer.
[0:57:36] getanime: @chmod_R_777 that doesn't make any sense
[0:57:41] FilzG: g6 truck fast af
[0:57:43] MDM4ever1986HD: Who picks Ferrero Rocher? I thought they were high class chocolate
[0:57:44] greyjulian: @nsan7 wanting all new characters in the PD has really put them behind the crim side of the server
[0:57:47] Diaz10gtg: he was ready to turn back if he heard gun KEK
[0:57:48] Mogs3: 0-6
[0:57:49] schenxt: mornin chat

[0:58:05] FilzG: holy turbo
[0:58:07] Diaz10gtg: holy fck that truck is going fast
[0:58:07] degeneratehermit: trucks faster than the corvette
[0:58:08] mikewhocheesehairyyyy12: That truck is a tank
[0:58:09] JumpStartMyFart: pit time
[0:58:10] mavericks312: @froogo0 if they dap den here they kill any moral the pd has and possibly piss of the senior officers talking last night
[0:58:10] BoldSlowbro: two pits and the taurus is disabled
[0:58:11] spicyville: that truck outruns 90% of the PD cars
[0:58:14] captain_steve_420: if denzel gets dapped/fired over this, im pretty sure aziz, beric, cornwood, and a bunch of others would be pissed
[0:58:16] GalaxyDoesTwich: what is the current poll about
[0:58:18] FvmousAce_: g6 trucks have money in them?
[0:58:19] FilzG: pd cars are a joke at this point
[0:58:20] Diaz10gtg: OMEGALUL
[0:58:21] amdj30: 6
[0:58:21] cruzare: F1 mega truck OMEGALUL
[0:58:21] greyjulian: yeah, these big trucks shouldn’t be able to go this fast
[0:58:25] Sonicfear: @space_Monkey11223344 Yea because firearms weren't and still aren't a thing, not legal, not sold and a dozen or so in the entire city.
[0:58:25] Blair63: Pit ptsd
[0:58:26] marlz365: 6-0 they going for as many goals as Den has Daps

[0:58:35] DoctorPez: @getanime It's good though because the majority of seniors have alot higher iq than Slacks
[0:58:36] MoohamedAlii: you need spike for this thing
[0:58:37] audy: you listen to kanye album? @Deansocool
[0:58:39] jgans2: pit
[0:58:39] mavericks312: @captain_steve_420 you can add mcnulty and ruby to that list as well
[0:58:41] kieran347: arsenal winning 6-0
[0:58:46] xenos620: KEKW need the interceptor to keep up with an armored truck
[0:58:46] xypher85: how has ferrero won that
[0:58:48] getanime: @captain_steve_420 even mccnalty and ruby said this is insane
[0:58:49] smoktrees489: G6 trucks have money in them but the truck itself can be tracked, so ofcourse the criminal will take out the money then drive it away somewhere
[0:58:50] BDG_Toa676: deansoHappy
[0:58:51] KellBellnf: @Sonicfear There's a lot more then that, I just can't say since its meta
[0:58:53] FilzG: @TheS1lentPuppet no way he can do it to such a large truck
[0:58:53] froogo0: Yea, pitting these trucks would send the patrol cars straight to Mosley’s
[0:58:53] Athasin: @MoohamedAlii They only have two cops on duty

[1:00:21] Athasin: @Athasin It's a lose lose honestly
[1:00:26] marneraiders: you probably need a double staged pit with too cars
[1:00:28] captain_steve_420: @greyjulian He tries to give off that persona, but watching his stream u know where he really stands
[1:00:35] mavericks312: we need slacks to retire and for bass to come back

[1:00:51] P51F144: you can pit it but its how you hit it you hit it (no meta)
[1:00:56] skilleto19: How does an armoured van this large handle that well at 115? ICANT

[1:37:21] FilzG: does he plead guilty?
[1:37:22] iJerrBear: LUL
[1:37:24] Juvraj: is that not Grand Theft Auto? stealing a g6 van
[1:37:24] dopest022: why not GTA?
[1:37:27] riiftzzz: this guy is chill asf
[1:37:35] captain_steve_420: even if Den does get fired, Cornwood will just hire him as soon as lil texas opens
[1:37:42] Thraxton1: @ChippieChad Not destroying. Taking it permanently, either by destruction or just keeping it forever or selling it off
[1:37:43] crazymick79: Did you read him as rights?
[1:37:44] BLazOR_Prime: GTA means to have the intent to not return the vehicle through destruction or selling
[1:37:44] HulkDiesel: @chippiechad no gta is intent to permanently deprive of vehicle. this guy had no intention of returning the truck. that makes it gta not joy ride
[1:37:47] Fast_doughnut: Crims that go to jail just jump straight back out its scuffed
[1:37:48] bdg_hyu: people really be saying whatever in chat for attention
[1:38:01] Athasin: @dopest022 Because he wasn't trying to deprive him of the vehicle indefinitely
[1:38:02] YoungBoris69: matthew antov with a warrent
[1:38:09] MDM4ever1986HD: @HulkDiesel this
[1:38:10] DjSprayK: @muscleman1000g you're just saying things, you cant guarantee anything with regarding that. you're guessing. He is appealing to children by being loud and provocative, grown ppl aint watching that
[1:38:16] jgans2: how many pepole target you but like they have no resson and trying to get you in a bad spot is it a small amount
[1:38:16] captain_steve_420: @Athasin wrinkle dingus

[1:38:54] greenburg22: @djsprayk some grown ppl do
[1:39:03] HulkDiesel: @athasin in your mind he was going to return the truck to the guy? be real
[1:39:11] DanLGG: @hulkdiesel to permanently deprive you have to be able to articulate the person was or was going to scrap or bin scratch the car. Driving til the wheels fall off is joyriding
[1:39:18] dopest022: maybe hes not doing gta cause theres no lawyers around going easy on him
[1:39:19] BLazOR_Prime: @HulkDiesel you have to prove it, thats the hard part
[1:39:25] Athasin: @DjSprayK @DjSprayK He actually can guarantee that because he's very public about his demographic stats
[1:39:25] DjSprayK: @pxtrick2703 the grammar used here proves my point pretty well LUL
[1:39:43] FilzG: who is even this guy to hate you like that?
[1:39:46] Athasin: @HulkDiesel In my mind he was going to leave the truck after he robbed it
[1:39:51] DanLGG: we know he wasn’t taking it back but it’s not about what you know. it’s about what you can prove
[1:39:52] Skenoj: new coin flip cmon

[1:40:17] jdotno: ISO standards
[1:40:17] dopest022: he definitely destroyed it

[1:40:43] m4l1kkk: Year, day, month imo
[1:40:46] captain_steve_420: Archer logging on when there's no cops on duty.... SUSGE
[1:40:47] ShaneOwens0: oh wow that was easy
[1:40:53] DiabolikBlood: you need a promotion
[1:40:54] Athasin: @HulkDiesel Now if had ocean dumped it and got into another vehicle and Denz caught him after, THAT is GTa
[1:40:57] Skenoj: EZ Clap

[1:41:29] d_o_g_o_: 5k for one group 6 bag
[1:41:31] xypher85: @DjSprayK stop both of you
[1:41:34] greenburg22: demo stats work the way hasan does them. where he takes a day and polls his audience honestly, cause all kids lie about age on sign ups. but when asked in a poll they have no reason to
[1:41:35] BDG_Toa676: deansoPopcorn deansoPopcorn
[1:41:39] Athasin: @Athasin 2% under 15
[1:41:40] AsuniRS: what a nice guy :)
[1:41:40] BDG_ScubaSteve: this one of the most civil interactions between cop and crim after shooting someone
[1:41:42] Skenoj: Den Zel could easily be promoted from cop to a normal civ KEKW
[1:41:43] DjSprayK: @pxtrick2703 yeah and it proves my point about his audience being kids
[1:41:47] DanLGG: actually ocean dumping is joyriding as well.
[1:41:47] JxhnJxe: Year/Month/Day make sense and Day/Month/Year make sense
[1:41:50] GalaxyDoesTwich: @xypher85 stand on yo bidness
[1:41:55] Mustang_6511: Wholesome crim
[1:42:00] TheHoll0w: @DjSprayK Stop fighting About Ginge in the chat lmao what's wrong with yall
[1:42:01] streptomyces: It doesn't matter if he leaves the vehicle abandoned, that's still joyriding. For a GTA charge you have to be able to articulate that they were going to have it chopped or destroyed.
[1:42:03] Trigonda: LUL
[1:42:03] BDG_Toa676: Gentlemens shake

[5:07:58] PCPPirate: omE
[5:08:00] MDM4ever1986HD: KEKW
[5:08:03] kahlilgo: “lying”
[5:08:08] MAZIN_M_SAYEED: @PepperAnn131 When?
[5:08:10] soloaire: "lying" lol he provided a brief statement when they wanted a detailed one without asking for a detailed statement
[5:08:11] impanda0: this is how they're going to be talking about den soon :(
[5:08:17] catloyalist: That was dappable. THey fired him for lying. which wasnt real, they twisted the situation into him lying when he just left out a detail. Slacks keeps saying he doubled down on the lie and that never happened when asked he admited to the whole thing.
[5:08:20] soloaire: also he was shot right after, it's a mess
[5:08:25] akonv3: Cornwood is a Johnson op too, his plan was wait and say sorry to slacks LOL
[5:08:30] ShinJiHun: lying by admission + straight up claiming he didn't say words that he did say
[5:08:31] Caeros: @MAZIN_M_SAYEED literally rolled with punches and made great RP
[5:08:34] ShinJiHun: omission*
[5:08:36] F_Nnn1: @soloaire he was repeatedly asked detailed questions like "did you say this, and do this" and he just kept saying no = lying
[5:08:45] MAZIN_M_SAYEED: @Caeros Exactly
[5:08:47] AnusReaktorMan: Deserved to be fited. Like slacks too for gun license
[5:08:56] MAZIN_M_SAYEED: @akonv3 Ramee actually called it out
[5:09:05] EGGZOLENTZ: @impanda0 i doubt denzel would do something like that den would but at most hecwould be suspended for awhile
[5:09:07] soloaire: @F_Nnn1 all after the fact and they made up their minds
[5:09:19] catloyalist: Slacks jumped to conclusions and has too much of an ego as an rper to back track on his choice.
[5:09:31] Athasin: Him getting in was him deciding to continue roleplaying the crime, not the cops ordering him to do crime
[5:09:34] colminaction: So are cops going to be fired for lying by omission in court "I don't recall" etc, won't be many left
[5:09:34] xsilas43: @akonv3, i mean that actually would have gotten johnson his job back KEKW
[5:10:10] soloaire: @colminaction don't have right to remain silent lol
[5:10:11] Khaotic_Gorilla: this is so divisive, i love it lmao
[5:10:11] kahlilgo: slacks got amped nd made a quick decision w/ virtually no backing at all
[5:10:13] Caeros: @ShinJiHun those words were actually irrelevant, slacks points to them in bad faith to attack his character
[5:10:14] catloyalist: @colminaction Even Ruth has gotten out of lies in cpt meetings by saying she misremembered the situation. So its all bs at this point
[5:10:16] F_Nnn1: @F_Nnn1 wut? all the cops on scene + mr K said something happened that way. Johnson asked repeatedly "did you do it this way" johnson kept saying no over and over again = fired for lying. If he just said "yes i did sorry" it would just have been a dap
