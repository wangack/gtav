[0:58:05] Fostethesnowman: Never got to use my 301 :(
[0:58:06] Shadaraman: Please swap Panthera and FCS for that
[0:58:08] teChino22: that feels like a Panthera nerf tbh
[0:58:12] CheatActivated: LFG SAMMY! Best ruleset! hisandhersHhhype  that was crazy to watch
[0:58:17] Shadaraman: I don't want to run around with a shotgun and get shot by FCS snipers

[0:58:46] fry_el_wason28: id rather have a sniper
[0:58:49] Sammyrai90: @yesterdaetv yeah lol it def helped the rule good suggestion
[0:58:49] teChino22: if you can't get close to them, shotgun is useless
[0:58:56] JudeMF: true that. Sniper at that point
[0:59:01] sapperdad01: @FreakNSweeet nice Fuse play there...
[0:59:02] kingPlays0608: sniper
[0:59:03] Fostethesnowman: It's subjective
[0:59:04] BleachDrinka: sniper
[0:59:12] thebigbone87: sniper is easier
[0:59:13] JudeMF: Sniper forsure. Irs situation based but sniper forsure
[0:59:15] Shadaraman: In a world where snipers exist, shotguns are the hardest
[0:59:15] CheatActivated: sniper is harder
[0:59:22] backtolobbygeez: only melee
[0:59:23] fry_el_wason28: it just depends on distance of fight
[0:59:25] Fostethesnowman: Reason why they are opposite types of gunsn
[0:59:27] CheatActivated: shotty is funnier cause u cant third party from range
[0:59:41] LIM0ZINE: lategame/buildings shotty rules
[0:59:46] Fastlain: Sentinel is a shotgun
[0:59:47] FreakNSweeet: @sapperdad01 thanks very much!!

[1:00:20] backtolobbygeez: vantage is a sniper why not
[1:00:30] heaventossed: I think that asking Andrew might be the wrong demographic... Almost all Panthera are gonna prefer a sniper
[1:00:30] phazexxreborn: and technically FCS can use vantage
[1:00:43] TinyWhiteGiraffe: is anyone elses live echoing?
[1:00:52] chefboyrjew00: Thank you Andrew!!!!!!
[1:00:54] LagarTss: we don't have a FCS in our team
[1:01:06] superlemonade941: vantage has double sniper though
[1:01:08] superlemonade941: lol
[1:01:10] BleachDrinka: no
[1:01:12] Sammyrai90: LUL
[1:01:13] teChino22: no way
[1:01:16] superlemonade941: ugh no ramparts
[1:01:18] LIM0ZINE: phaze said no rampart
[1:01:18] teChino22: rampart should not be allowed

[1:01:30] chefboyrjew00: Andrew spitting like a MFER right now!!!!!
[1:01:38] shortstough: @LagarTss its whoever is in column 1 counts as the FCS
[1:01:42] thezenhigh: yall crazy
[1:01:54] LagarTss: @shortstough ok
[1:01:57] inb4jordan: it's not that complicated
[1:02:15] fry_el_wason28: Typically youre the one who doesnt follow the rules andrew! but hey im just spectating
[1:02:17] inb4jordan: I have an ape brain, and I understand at least 60% of whats going on
[1:02:23] LIM0ZINE: andrew cant even listen to comms, i think life is just hard for him
[1:02:25] Fastlain: He just mad he can't follow simple stuff like "No small heals" lol
[1:02:26] superlemonade941: scopes?
[1:02:57] 1crazy1bonnie: are their swords
[1:02:57] Sammyrai90: @Fastlain hisandhersPog hisandhersPog hisandhersPog hisandhersPog hisandhersPog hisandhersPog

[1:05:09] JazzyFunsized: are you Regina George because I feel personally victimized @freaknsweeet
[1:05:13] fry_el_wason28: i feel like not having a FCS is a way bigger disadvantage tbh
[1:05:13] KayRoscoe: yeah its never split evenly
[1:05:43] khaoticyang: @jazzyfunsized “sweats are for Wednesdays”
[1:06:04] fry_el_wason28: yeah but imagine some of the pantheras try to IGL vs Andrew
