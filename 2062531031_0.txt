[1:43:45] badsmomo: Jose's Hoses
[1:43:49] pootie2goood: @izzygus333 exactly. Also what hurts is while you are selling all these mats to everyone right now without putting it into your own operation you are allowing the plp around you to just get further ahead in the buttgame
[1:44:14] mogambo_khushhua: Did speedy get the materials from cozney??
[1:44:17] autisticboots: yoooo Speedy

[1:49:07] projectapple2: watch that jewelry still be there when you’re back lmao
[1:49:33] ProphecyEU: Low-key it would be interesting if Lang did only fillout his contract orders but just holds all the other circuitboards just to juice up the farm.. They could prob get caught up in like a week KEKW 100+ buttcoins
[1:49:35] kidsuper05: When's your flight sayeed
[1:49:48] trippinovaryou: no channel points.. harrVape_HF

[1:53:01] quickwiiddit: @nate921269 speedy and Stevie are both 100
[1:53:08] guygavin: main sellers on the first app and other sellers on the 2nd
[1:53:19] AdLib_24: it's probably the strain rep since 2nd app doesn't have a strain
[1:53:26] awesomephilip11: They just need to swap if speedy's test will work out.
[1:54:08] projectapple2: but would that fuck up the usb thingy or no?
[1:54:15] legion0222: May mess up usb progression.  Probably still worth it though
