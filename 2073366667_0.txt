[0:53:04] MDM4ever1986HD: KEKW
[0:53:11] longhorns2565: I‚Äôm pretty sure he gonna be fired
[0:53:26] MDM4ever1986HD: Are we allowed to post clips of the meeting or we going to watch the meeting?
[0:53:26] Gachiguru: Clueless
[0:53:29] Triist0ne: Clueless
[0:53:30] AsuniRS: cornwood has plot armor
[0:53:32] StevenB79: Have we learned nothing
[0:53:33] Landoram: THey 100% firing him and Moon names him Sheriff while they work to open LASO
[0:53:35] ramsin50: he is so fired
[0:53:36] GalaxyDoesTwich: his name isnt denzel he wont be fired
[0:53:36] crazyfrez: why?
[0:53:39] Cheexur: nah cornwood is def fired lets see the vids
[0:53:40] trinimini10: would make no sense he would not get fired
[0:53:40] Rascal_PM: just my opinion but I think Denzel should always be off duty on Sunday. cop RP is dead and this crackhead energy + onelifers is perfect on Sunday
[0:53:41] Kayklip: hes gonna be fine hes not denzel Shruge
[0:53:41] tukidi_: I forget to say Good Morning deano
[0:53:43] j0Ity: Clueless
[0:53:43] karaskyee: thats crazy
[0:53:43] m4l1kkk: You got fired for 10, so will he. They need to be consistent
[0:53:44] judgement_12: I predict they will fire cornwood because they are going to assume he was behind the union
[0:53:46] scooberdooberty: we said that about Denzel too lmao
[0:53:48] entvidya: snitch prison OMEGALUL
[0:53:48] BakedBeandon: he‚Äôs so gone lol
[0:53:48] jeremyks9: Will be so much drama if cornwood gets fired
[0:53:50] 999krm: they know he will get rehired instantly from the mayor so they won't fire him
[0:53:52] Gachiguru: captains are seething mad their power is being questioned
[0:53:52] theblackdog808: depends on how the captns want to proceed though, after yesterday they might get wild lol
[0:53:52] TheGrayK: Nah hes fired especially if ruth has anything to do with it her ego is already bruised
[0:53:55] m4l1kkk: He needs to be or they're inconsistent
[0:53:56] volicarebear: idk the captains seem to think george bush the 23rd was unarmed....
[0:54:01] RyinTwitch: surely he will be fine COPIUM
[0:54:04] longhorns2565: I think he may get same thing den did, with everything that‚Äôs gone on for cornwood
[0:54:07] nodwongo: even if he gets fired mayor will do something about it
[0:54:08] hafugu: I think there needs to be a difference in how the Captains handle procedural daps and RP daps
[0:54:08] RexPappa: Honestly I hope he gets fired, the adventures he gets into not being in the PD are pretty funny
[0:54:11] m4l1kkk: If he isn't fired, then it's unfair because he got 11 DAPs above your 10
[0:54:12] blackops567: this crew is straight jokes
[0:54:17] VioraX: george bush the 24th today?
[0:54:17] TheOGWombat: to be fair shooting a downed man is WAY more egregious than pitting a car into johnson
[0:54:22] Mallyraws: i think hes fired but the mayors say might have some influence
[0:54:25] Landoram: If they keep him on, they'll feel they can have some control over him so yeah, I'm actually not sure
[0:54:26] MDM4ever1986HD: @nodwongo yeah Max and Cornwood are good
[0:54:26] j0Ity: @volicarebear he technically was on that last bullet
[0:54:36] Prozor135: There's too much turmoil in the council for cornwood to get fired. Capitans are gonna keep it low-key for now
[0:54:37] detergent86: even if he gets fired moonmoon can basically do as he pleases with the bill they passed. moon could simply appoint cornwood to whatever position he wants.
[0:54:39] MDM4ever1986HD: Eugene KEKW
[0:54:39] davidpeck_: even if he gets fired he will get a chance
[0:54:48] Citystar619: Cornwood character has complained enough they will keep him
[0:54:59] carparker76: cornwood's problem is he double/triple down and argued the daps
[0:55:02] whacksapple: captains will look bad either way. catch 22
[0:55:04] volicarebear: @j0Ity true the last one, but turner said something like "put fired 25 bullets at an unarmed man" or something like that. maybe he was uninformed
[0:55:21] Gachiguru: Copege
[0:55:24] m4l1kkk: 11 DAPs is a world record. They need to be consistent imo
[0:55:27] ramsin50: the same way you got fired
[0:55:31] zuckscalulator: people said the same thing about you
[0:55:31] fartybum: fired the black cop during your month
[0:55:32] riiftzzz: does the verdict of the mayor meeting yesterday benefit denzel?
[0:55:36] zuckscalulator: and you got fired
[0:55:42] OiAM_Paka: we speed running tf outta 2024
[0:55:44] MDM4ever1986HD: It's 5 with a leap year right?
[0:55:44] davidpeck_: fired 2 black cops in feb
[0:55:46] theblackdog808: they wouldn't have fired you if they were worried about retention though
[0:55:46] nantredan: saying he was unarmed is wild
[0:55:47] girlballor: 3
[0:55:49] s4dk1l: which gang is dean part of?
[0:55:54] chapoop_: 4 days left
[0:55:57] carparker76: the real reason cornwood wont get fired is because he is esfand
[0:55:58] nathanarmstrong0: Cornwood will have a better chance of promotion if he gets fired
[0:55:58] Banchu: so how did yesterdays council meeting go?
[0:56:00] Jengwynn: cadet school will be interesting with a returning character from 3.0 (no spoilers)
[0:56:01] zuckscalulator: to cover ass? i see what your saying
[0:56:03] quasarptolemy: where's the clip of dean ripping on the dumb february jokes
[0:56:04] Rascal_PM: if they are RPing like real cops, then nobody should get fired just like irl  kaicBLM deansoCD
[0:56:09] TheGrayK: Their egos are bruised firing him is a great way for theim to show their power
[0:56:13] theblackdog808: yea
[0:56:14] livedin: it‚Äôs crazy corn shoots a guy 25 times Johnson and you make a mistake ahahah
[0:56:17] ramsin50: i hope he gets fired it will be a lot more interesting
[0:56:26] fartybum: does Malton like you?
[0:56:29] Joe161103: ur gonna get ur job back cpts getting sacked
[0:56:39] onisrepelle: clip tiime???
[0:56:44] TheOGWombat: downbad cornwood ark would be epic
[0:56:45] intoxicologistt: @livedin sniffthenewchatter
[0:56:48] MDM4ever1986HD: @onisrepelle before storm
[0:57:03] onisrepelle: @MDM4ever1986HD ohhh okay thanks
[0:57:05] longhorns2565: I think because of everything going on with the council he will get fired. I dunno for sure but think cpts see cornwood as an enemy rn
[0:57:10] riiftzzz: Who do you think would be a good commisioner? Personally I think Berick, Ruby or Turner
[0:57:12] MDM4ever1986HD: @onisrepelle no worries
[0:57:15] detergent86: slacks got scared and told moon that Ruth will come down to city hall and personally apologize for her actions the night before xD
[0:57:25] m4l1kkk: Worrying about the future just makes you anxious, have fun in the present and it will work out deansoRNG
[0:57:34] Vorpalwarp: Cornwood has the best interest of the PD at heart.  Not the best interest of the Captains at heart, and thats the issue
[0:57:34] fartybum: honestly Johnson didnt even make a mistake. +8 RP points for Johnson event. stood on business and beat Mr K down Halarious
[0:57:35] onisrepelle: @detergent86 ii saw that suuiiiiiii
[0:57:37] Welshstig: he's enemy of other people's interests
[0:57:43] Kayklip: @m4l1kkk MMMMMMMM
[0:57:49] TheOGWombat: i wanna see the clip of cpt ruth apologizing
[0:57:51] nathanarmstrong0: The pd would be smart to hire him back because if he's fired he could take there jobs
[0:57:51] StevenB79: He's a threat to their power
[0:58:03] Prozor135: Cornwood is too close to Dab and Shib at this point. Their interests align too much
[0:58:05] fartybum: Ya Johnsons done for
[0:58:08] Gachiguru: the captains only considered themselves to be capable of being chief of police bnrLmao
[0:58:12] LongDongSilverrr13: did dean react to last night already?
[0:58:15] theblackdog808: nah he still denying lying, he done LUL
[0:58:28] TheGrayK: They 100% perceive him as a Traitor to the pd and Now their egos are bruised they are going to lash out at cornwood
[0:58:28] m4l1kkk: Freedom deansoRNG
[0:58:29] Banchu: Cornwood is a threat to integrity, allegedly LUL
[0:58:32] Prozor135: Johnson is a CG rapper now
[0:58:35] ZCrimes: Nah, Johnson made several death threats on the phone too, in succession
[0:58:36] detergent86: Johnson just needed to show some motherfucking accountability
[0:58:36] Pee_aRe: lol
[0:58:37] BakedBeandon: the captains don‚Äôt like how close cornwood is with the mayor
[0:58:40] dylboy909: but isn't cornwood now against the captains from their perspectives
[0:58:41] longhorns2565: @gachiguru slacks claimed that was only Ruth‚Äôs perspective
[0:58:42] Landoram: Change cars
[0:58:42] theblackdog808: LUL
[0:58:43] RexPappa: it was pretty funny seeing the captains panic like officers do
[0:58:43] BGOMgaming: max said if cornwood was fired he would just reinstate him , we will see what happens
[0:58:50] livedin: crazy the captains gotta dap themselves dumb system
[0:59:08] MrPhoNoodle: oh u didnt see the changes to the Dap system?
[0:59:10] Jengwynn: I‚Äôm excited for cadet academy especially if Denzel‚Äôs getting trained by someone from 3.0 (if said person creates the character in time)
[0:59:10] fartybum: @livedin HUH
[0:59:27] blackops567: has dean been arrested at all or does he have a clean record?
[0:59:28] intoxicologistt: @livedin finally thats what they needed
[0:59:36] Banchu: Captains gotta DAP themselves because there is no chief
[0:59:41] riiftzzz: @Jengwynn it will be slacks, mcnulty and ruby
[0:59:53] Geralt_De_Rivia: does no one realize this is literally the plot of Star Wars Revenge of the sith where Anakin is close with the chancellor
[1:00:00] nathanarmstrong0: Ain't koil coming back to rp at the end off the month
[1:00:05] Geralt_De_Rivia: cornwood is anakin
[1:00:08] capt_buttcheeks: i miss conan Sadge
[1:00:22] Prozor135: Dab will pardon Mr K, give Ramee his lawyer license back and give cornwood a sheriff office. And probably fire Ruth
[1:00:26] Landoram: @Geralt_De_Rivia Yo this is a fire analogy
[1:00:31] codingle: @Geralt_De_Rivia lmaooo
[1:00:36] Bruggie: @blackops567 He still got his job at G6 so ig it's clear
[1:00:37] riiftzzz: After training will you be a PPO or a cadet tho, because that could be weird af
[1:00:38] Geralt_De_Rivia: Im right no?
[1:00:43] m4l1kkk: Cornwood needs the office ASAP deansoRNG
[1:00:54] detergent86: Donald bush 23 must have been the young ones if cornwood is Anakin
[1:01:20] Prozor135: And then big C and Denzel will chill in LASO
[1:01:25] Banchu: we seriously need Bush XXIV so more officers get fired PepeLaugh
[1:01:42] Landoram: I'll be completely honest...I think Cornwood, Esquire arc to eventual judge would be an amazing storyline
[1:02:00] Geralt_De_Rivia: you are on the police department but we do not grant you the rank of senior cornwood
[1:02:12] chapoop_: @prozor135 LASO. ot gonna open anytime soon when the problem with pd is not enough cops
[1:02:21] livedin: I don‚Äôt think there is any good options for chief of police right now.
[1:02:34] Banchu: Banchu subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Bush XXIV? PauseChamp
[1:02:42] macneutron: Damn, Chelsea Believers might eat good
[1:02:48] MoohamedAlii: Is Donald Bush 24 gonna show up today? @Deansocool
[1:02:49] Prozor135: Esfand said that he'll stop playing if he can't be a cop. But that was before his lawyer arc
[1:02:55] MDM4ever1986HD: 2 W's
[1:02:58] TheHoll0w: a new one lifer today deano?
[1:02:59] lazydog905: @livedin I agree.

[1:03:15] Prozor135: @chapoop_ yeah true. Probably won't happen until April
[1:03:16] Landoram: Donald Bush 22 or 24 MUST make an appearance today
[1:03:19] planeswerecool: Bush XX gonna show up
[1:03:26] BOSSTUGGLES: did he see the meeting?
[1:03:34] MDM4ever1986HD: @BOSSTUGGLES not yet
[1:03:37] lazydog905: @livedin maybe Rudy
[1:03:37] 39dk_: damm my boy got some waves
[1:03:46] mizkifsrecedinghairline: The juicy part was at the beginning anyways.
[1:03:48] Ricanelite: whats up dean!!
[1:03:51] Bigeyez: There are some good options. McNulty and Ruby imo I would have said Turner before but if xiceman can't stream much because of irl stuff it wouldn't work
[1:03:58] Banchu: I fell asleep in the middle of the meeting TBH LUL
[1:03:59] Bigeyez: For commish
[1:04:14] m4l1kkk: Who
[1:04:20] Bigeyez: Yeah berric is good
[1:04:25] daveshiesty23: Beric 1000%
[1:04:27] livedin: @lazydog905 yeah she‚Äôs pretty trustworthy
[1:04:29] riiftzzz: 100% him or ruby
[1:04:32] Landoram: Or Ruby
[1:04:32] hereforff9: you
[1:04:34] ramsin50: the state is the one choosing anyways
[1:04:35] bogwellis: Cornwood is senior.....by age
[1:04:35] hereforff9: why not you
[1:04:39] Geralt_De_Rivia: i dont know if ruby wants it
[1:04:45] hereforff9: frick
[1:04:46] 0x000b: Ruby
[1:04:48] ikky___: Nah we need conan Clarkson to return
[1:04:52] rat_lord06: watch it be derolo
[1:04:56] mizkifsrecedinghairline: You're old as fuck.  What are you talking about?
[1:04:56] Briimmy: yo what up Dean!\
[1:04:59] Prozor135: Corn only wants the sheriff office
[1:04:59] VH_KRIEG: did dean react to the recent whole CG-PD situation?
[1:05:00] chapoop_: I think Chief should be someone that both sides of PD can trust
[1:05:01] ilostuniverse: Not even a cadet yet deansoWeird
[1:05:03] m4l1kkk: Lock in and focus up
[1:05:04] Brisk_Avocado: dean got a gun yet? theyre in today right?
[1:05:04] Banchu: Ruby has a good attitude, proffesional and very chill at the same time
[1:05:06] riiftzzz: uh oh
[1:05:07] ramsin50: go get him
[1:05:08] nizmo_ttn: Smoke his ass
[1:05:08] Anglo614: guard just chilling
[1:05:11] Sneakystinkyratman: What if they demote everyone so only the captains are senior or higher KEKW
[1:05:14] livedin: @ikky___ no way is Conan coming back after what happened
[1:05:21] m4l1kkk: Moral support, classic
[1:05:27] theblackdog808: damn
[1:05:30] macneutron: Won't seniors be conflicted, they might be lenient to the captains who promoted them
[1:05:31] karaskyee: bonk
[1:05:33] MDM4ever1986HD: Would you get the same rank as before when you complete academy?
[1:05:35] PacGamer: I thiunk Ruby gets it she seems cool
[1:05:35] lazydog905: @banchu and a good sense of humour
[1:05:40] MDM4ever1986HD: BONK
[1:05:44] mizkifsrecedinghairline: Murder was the case that they gave me.
[1:05:46] fartybum: They playing with positions but their inner circles positions are concrete asfuck thats some highschooler shit
[1:05:51] 0x000b: @Sneakystinkyratman KEKW
[1:05:51] bdg_hyu: 4.0 UAV
[1:06:09] Bigeyez: @sneakystinkyratman if they demoted everyone like that then that it just giving the mayor more ammo to actually get them fired
[1:06:13] MDM4ever1986HD: What timezone is Beric?
[1:06:20] Sathure: Berric is 3rd shift. He fits right in with Mayor hours.
[1:06:23] Prozor135: @macneutron but it needs to be approved by Dab or who ever investigated the pd
[1:06:26] Geralt_De_Rivia: beric also has a really sexy voice too
[1:06:31] riiftzzz: Beric is one of the most active officers tho?
[1:06:35] jeremyks9: They said they submitted trhe 3 captains names and when they ask slacks about it he said that was all Ruth
[1:06:37] Sathure: 2 AM
[1:06:42] daveshiesty23: 2 am
[1:06:42] livedin: someone suggested to dab that these positions should be limited to a month or 2 so people don‚Äôt get comfortable with the power. good idea imo
[1:06:49] Welshstig: he could just wake up super very early LUL
[1:06:53] ramsin50: late shift 2 and shift 3 maybe
[1:06:58] m4l1kkk: Lmao
[1:06:58] Sathure: But he's usually on later 2nd shift
[1:07:01] blackops567: PepeLaugh
[1:07:02] mizkifsrecedinghairline: Ruth not being at the meeting yesterday kind of sealed their fate.

[1:08:55] JDwight: chat did he say tactically? wasn‚Äôt sure.
[1:08:57] Sathure: Ruby or McNulty could work but I think Beric checks the most boxes.
[1:09:00] Haretic: @mizkifsrecedinghairline bingo
[1:09:04] m4l1kkk: What would you do if Cornwood said a joke?
[1:09:06] RexPappa: bike patrol would be hilarious, everyone would clown that cop
[1:09:07] Geralt_De_Rivia: i think he said technically?
[1:09:11] fartybum: thats what ive been talking about, just punish them by making em work harder

[1:09:33] RexPappa: testically
[1:09:35] ballin_colin94: TECHNICALLY chat
[1:09:38] Welshstig: tactically, but not actually PepeLaugh
[1:09:40] AfroAltruism: wag1 dean an chat

[1:09:46] kave41: Do you have any idea when is the cornwood review taking place?
[1:09:48] PacGamer: @PacGamer but slacks told cornwood about the new pd bikes last night so I don't think he's getting fired
[1:09:50] Aoniar: are basing this of your army life
[1:09:53] Geralt_De_Rivia: technically he would tackticly be the best right
[1:09:57] blackops567: it is kinda crazy how wearing a hat is the same amount of daps as misfiring your gun
[1:09:58] riiftzzz: they mayor is going to fire ruth PepeLaugh

[1:10:15] Vorpalwarp: thats wild bro
[1:10:20] TheTimeFlash: hit my 11 years smh
[1:10:20] GalaxyDoesTwich: damn u old
[1:10:26] Vorpalwarp: 10 years of 11B is insane
[1:10:28] theblackdog808: not gonna lie, I kinda want to see denzel and cornwood going through academy, it'd be hilarious
[1:10:30] PacGamer: @JDwight tastefully

[1:11:09] ChocolateMassage: Did marty finally buy the house
[1:11:09] Bigeyez: @fatty_tatties sometime after 2 pm est
[1:11:23] m4l1kkk: Some people would say streaming is harder than a laborious 9-5 deansoCozy
[1:11:27] nizmo_ttn: ez
[1:11:31] BDG_Toa676: MINK
[1:11:35] VH_KRIEG: WORLD STAARRRR HE GOT KO TF OUT
[1:11:45] Geralt_De_Rivia: @m4l1kkk its def more violotile
[1:11:49] m4l1kkk: Who saw the Twitter drama
[1:11:56] Geralt_De_Rivia: ye
[1:11:56] ajay311: Ya
[1:11:58] Djfsappy: no he wrote that
[1:12:00] david199915: The cop arc is over ??
[1:12:01] nathanarmstrong0: Yeah
[1:12:05] Bigeyez: Nah it was part of the legislation
[1:12:05] ramsin50: he's the one who said it
[1:12:06] RyinTwitch: its written in the law
[1:12:08] whacksapple: no its written in the legislation
[1:12:09] ebos22: No it's in the bill I think
[1:12:09] RyinTwitch: i though
[1:12:10] AfroAltruism: the mayor wrote it tbf
[1:12:14] pieruruka: Beric would be the perfect commissioner imo
[1:12:15] daveshiesty23: yeah but he agreed to that
[1:12:15] oengeesa: don‚Äôt think so
[1:12:17] Fatty_Tatties: I think that was brought up in the meeting yesterday
[1:12:18] Bigeyez: It's in the law
[1:12:18] AsuniRS: they're just going to push a puppet like derollo Sadge
[1:12:21] Xierany: Captains could also demote all Seniors to force a vote between them
[1:12:25] Sathure: Does it specify Senior of the CURRENT PD?
[1:12:26] E_Turn_UL: Cornwood got like what 5 more days till he does the sheriff's office presentation for the mayor right?
[1:12:27] ViewbotReportingforDuty: Everything runs on PD will be reviewed by the Mayor and Commissioner so yes
[1:12:28] Velehoh: @AsuniRS mayor wont accept it
[1:12:28] Gachiguru: demote all seniors EZ
[1:12:40] howyaben: @asunirs Ain't no way that ever happens
[1:12:41] m4l1kkk: Treason charges incoming, ain't no way
[1:12:48] Bigeyez: And the mayor doesn't even pick it. The state has final say on who gets commissioner
[1:12:50] xxlonegunmanxx: I guess assasination is the only choice left.
[1:12:50] ViewbotReportingforDuty: DAPs will be reviewed, firing officers, promotions, everything
[1:12:54] Gachiguru: cornwood murder charges Sadge
[1:13:00] livedin: pd has some big hurdles but potentially the best rp if people lock in
[1:13:03] riiftzzz: Yeah
[1:13:04] jeremyks9: devs
[1:13:05] Rillenord: yeah, im actually starting to think that slacks ooc is trying so hard not to mald hes not gunna be head in pd
[1:13:05] Juvraj: hi
[1:13:05] david199915: Almost has -0 police in the highway on E.U time lmao
[1:13:05] ramsin50: the admins
[1:13:05] pieruruka: YEP
[1:13:05] 95eagles: the council
[1:13:05] ajay311: Ruth got some balls lmao
[1:13:05] Athasin: Yes
[1:13:07] Slosiar88: yes
[1:13:08] Bigeyez: Admins yeah
[1:13:08] Chadox6: if its sr and above how would that change any behavior
[1:13:13] Sathure: Yeah state is admins/owners
[1:13:15] m4l1kkk: X ain't got a choice üò≠
[1:13:16] capt_buttcheeks: isnt slack an admin too?
[1:13:17] TheOGWombat: admin
[1:13:19] riiftzzz: Mainly x koil and buddha
[1:13:19] ebos22: There's no way he's going to present any of the Captians names to the state tho
[1:13:20] Athasin: @95eagles The council is the city
[1:13:22] Fadamaka: saab
[1:13:26] Daywalkerblade: Who would be your choice among current PD to lead?
[1:13:27] livedin: x is an admin?
[1:13:30] shadow__rain: if it goes to state Cornwood is winning
[1:13:32] PacGamer: PD just needs to get Andrews input again instead of doing stupid shit
[1:13:32] jeremyks9: Ruth collecting evidence on the mayor already lol
[1:13:33] m4l1kkk: X doesn't know a damn thing üòÇ
[1:13:40] ajay311: There is no they picking Ruth or slacks
[1:13:41] Cheexur: yes only owners and senior admins
[1:13:42] Bigeyez: X is a part owner so yeah
[1:13:42] Slosiar88: @livedin owner
[1:13:44] Sathure: @capt_buttcheeks yes but so is Moon
[1:13:45] ramsin50: no it's the admins not the owners
[1:13:46] E_Turn_UL: If they do dap reviews, Derolo daps should melt in seconds.
[1:13:46] ajay311: Way
[1:13:48] ebos22: He gives them 3-4 names then they pick
[1:13:48] Vorpalwarp: wait so MoonMoon is the mayor and the state?
[1:13:57] wowitspeter: @jeremyks9 damn no way
[1:14:00] capt_buttcheeks: @Sathure didnt know about moon woah
[1:14:03] P51F144: CHAT help me did Captin get a Commisher? last night
[1:14:04] ViewbotReportingforDuty: @PacGamer Andrew is a real life officier, he's actually busy being a real cop
[1:14:04] livedin: went from being banned to owning that‚Äôs a baller move
[1:14:08] chmbrs: x and buddha both have 25% i believe and koil has the other 50% iirc
[1:14:13] riiftzzz: so is ssaab
[1:14:26] m4l1kkk: Another 25 is the NVE guy
[1:14:27] Fatty_Tatties: In an RP sense, I would like if a cop with multiple daps would get it. So it would be like "you gotta represent your station". Aziz would be a fun choice. Realistically I think Ruby would be best as she is by the books but gives a lot of leeway and does favor the RP side rather than just giving out punishments.
[1:14:28] ebos22: I think it will be Ruby or Beric
[1:14:36] coupe214: @chmbrs you forgot about razed
[1:14:39] blackops567: @Deansocool you gonna hit up the ironforge gym when you visit texas?
[1:14:40] Geralt_De_Rivia: idk your on the server not us
[1:14:40] BDG_Toa676: I swear there was a 4th owner chmbrs
[1:14:41] PacGamer: @ViewbotReportingforDuty yeah he was talking to cornwood the other day and said he was only gonna be on if he was otherwise it's boring
[1:14:47] fartybum: if it aint Ruby of Beric is ogre
[1:14:48] FunChatt: Slacks also part of the  state as admin
[1:14:48] nizmo_ttn: lmaoo cut for doin wat...
[1:14:49] fartybum: its
[1:14:49] AfroAltruism: I'm hoping ruby gets it personally
[1:14:52] nathanarmstrong0: @chmbrs koil has 25% the offer is the guy who owns NVE
[1:14:59] Sathure: Ssaab is admin, Moon is admin, K is admin, Vig is admin AFAIK.
[1:15:01] Dr_Epica: asking for his cut as soon as he gets in the car KEKW
[1:15:09] muddyaaron: what is 200 months = in irl days
[1:15:09] Haretic: Ruby would be preferable
[1:15:09] nathanarmstrong0: Uther
[1:15:10] TheOGWombat: 5antho would be good
[1:15:11] fartybum: Ya i see alot of Ruby work and shes actually a decent human being
[1:15:15] chmbrs: aahhhhhh thats dope that razed gets a cut
[1:15:15] BDG_parth28: @bdg_toa676  there is razed
[1:15:19] m4l1kkk: Moral support not compass
[1:15:20] BDG_parth28: He is like koil
[1:15:20] Velehoh: @muddyaaron 200mins
[1:15:25] BDG_Toa676: Ahhh ye him
[1:15:39] ajay311: deansoP
[1:15:44] Rillenord: @Deansocool did u not see Ssaab yday in the meeting? he actually wrote to the admins to make sure council wouldnt overwrite the pd xD
[1:15:46] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: üíÄ
[1:15:47] sapnupuaS: stand on it
[1:15:49] BDG_Toa676: Here we go again

[3:19:38] King0fKhaos: yeah crane was clutch in the meeting
[3:19:39] froogo0: Crane might have said something (since they drafted it together) , but he probably assumes taht Max will act in good faith.
[3:19:42] CleverGecko: the issue is that the mayor has turned to palpatine

[3:53:48] ebos22: The other thing is they keep talking about how Mx was a terrorist but 4.0 starts off everyone with a clean slate...and technically Max has done nothing wrong in 4.0
[3:53:49] JWisdom: @ViewbotReportingforDuty yeah i was wondering like, the pd is torn apart currently might as well let the officers choose where they wanna be
[3:53:50] tyler__96: You need aziz with you for the doug court case
[3:53:52] PsychoJoker: That clip I sent shows Max telling Cornwood if he's fired he will just reinstate him
