[1:02:37] StreamElements: Do not share in-game information regarding other players/content creators. Acie doesn't want to know and this can instead harm in-game decisions. This may result to a time out or ban without warning. (Meta-gaming is when you tell Acie what a different streamer is doing on the same server) Thank you.
[1:02:43] Beltano: On the other side Nunu was gone 1,5 days and shit happened so it's complicated

[1:05:08] twitch_Turd_Boy: Your body will need more salt, salt is required for the osmosis process to actually absorb water. Drink as much water as you want you won’t feel hydrated if you don’t have any salt in your system. Have something salty it will reduce your headache!

[8:04:39] Tenivir: yeah i mean dont let chat convince you otherwise if you want to
[8:04:40] Anxious_Octopus: investing $100k with a 2% return every week is $2k a week, $10k total return

[8:06:57] M0hkofantti: 10k makes so much more under you than on some random
[8:06:58] Duke_403: make more sense if you had more offline time like vacation, u could buy your own houses and sell em in a month at more profit

[8:07:32] cutz28: got no time to waste time
[8:07:32] Alaineman: it's just 10% over 5 weeks, which is not a lot
[8:07:33] bigtex494: Might Miss click and get the ace
[8:07:38] spidervenom11: ok so you give them 10k and over the next 5 weeks you get $200 a week?

[8:07:58] xfirepop: it’s always the same math
[8:07:58] 2wicked001: best not to do it at all
[8:07:58] Clodhoppr: if you just got your own server rack with the 10k you would make more back with the buttcoin
[8:07:58] NavyWavyy: :b
[8:07:58] boomershow824: I'd do it just to hang out with K
[8:07:59] cutz28: invest in $$$

[8:08:08] ag_ko: that guy is weird
[8:08:09] Nickomongo: return isnt good either way when u make 10k in 2 hours
[8:08:11] Zeynlol: not worth under 100k
[8:08:11] Stewy21: You could invest and see... But My K is the biggest known scammer in the city haha
[8:08:12] Partyhead: Only worth if u get 2% profit forever
[8:08:12] M0hkofantti: The percentage does not rise with money, so still not worth at all
[8:08:12] Duke_403: u could get a car or house, they will appreciate more most likely
[8:08:14] Raivolver: it would be good if there is nothing else to do wtih it
[8:08:14] notjakobi: you can reinvest after 5 weeks
[8:08:15] SlUWAX: you make more just by asking ppls on street

[8:08:17] nykter1: Ye but how long til u are fully reinbursed
[8:08:17] doobieMcLoven: his game is smooth
[8:08:19] 2awkard4u: it only make sense if you have money you don't use
[8:08:22] judgement_12: it is a huge opportunity cost, you could rent out your own property with that kind of money
[8:08:23] Anxious_Octopus: yes, but people with over 100k aren't making these investments
[8:08:23] auxfrog: say 50k 25% return
[8:08:24] Taxike: too slow pace investment
[8:08:24] ironbullman: It wil only make sense if you have money to waste

[8:08:35] shessweet: peanut mad funny
[8:08:36] cgHaddy: 2% is just not enough

[8:08:47] Hollowshaun: yeah directions away from you
[8:08:49] brandonsux: Susge
[8:08:51] basards: you all should put your money into a house and rent it out
[8:08:53] wildturkeyno9: You are effectively making an unsecured loan with no guarantee of repayment
[8:08:53] CRlCK: @spidervenom11 they not roleplaying as mathemeticians i'll tell you that much
[8:08:58] LePichu: @spidervenom11 You get the initial investment back

[8:13:07] Ginoveli: otherwise its pointless
[8:13:08] Olvi12: you're right that its passive money but think of how much 10k does in your current situation since you need parts
[8:13:09] Dano_Leza: MR k the biggest scammer
[8:13:09] SajuukJustin19: @CRlCK ive been laughing this whole time

[8:13:16] CRlCK: @SajuukJustin19 LOOL I RESPECT IT 100%
[8:13:18] M0hkofantti: Raia has loan company where she loans money for 20% weekly interest why would he loan to someone with 2% interest
[8:13:19] Bionic_Devil: the duration is horrible
[8:13:23] MonMunn: it’s not
[8:13:23] esnytayy: he’s scamming y’all so bad
[8:13:24] auxfrog: I mean it’s not really a scam. but you should argue for a better deal
[8:13:27] LePichu: 5 weeks is basically one month
[8:13:28] Phasehero: He is a huge scammer!
[8:13:30] HandofOdd: A business run by Pnut and Mr K is insane
[8:13:31] loboddia: no since you are loosing opportunities
[8:13:31] Gundaree: ayone asked how they make/increase money? lol
[8:13:31] Tresch: If the FSG House gets robbed its by this guys
[8:13:34] Tenivir: yeah the 5 weeks is gonna wipe out the gains by inflation and things changing in the city
[8:13:36] Tenivir: its too long
[8:13:36] wolvyb1ceps: The funny thing is he is not flexing he actually has 100k LUL
[8:13:37] super_sl4yer: Mr k
[8:13:39] Ginoveli: he basically made 20k now for you to only make 2000 a week LUL
[8:13:48] Kangaroo_Balls: So much can be done with 100k during 5 weeks, so many lost opportunities
[8:13:57] loboddia: its not the real world, 10% is nothing
[8:13:57] silverarrows47: The housing market will boom
[8:13:57] RealBalckeN: I mean it is a good idea
[8:13:59] Dano_Leza: no it’s not because that’s your money not his
[8:13:59] AurelStar: Mini Rack & GPU Pog
[8:13:59] cravi: it’s gonna inflate
[8:14:00] Damzexx: it is so bad
[8:14:00] theeragingbull: if it inflates, it would be good
[8:14:01] RagoDK: 80 minutes crafting
[8:14:02] Bestevenn_: Houses will probably go up in price
[8:14:02] Sniffle04: doesnt change how much you're getting if housing market inflates
[8:14:03] MonMunn: as a financial advisor that whole convo gave ptsd and a headache lol
[8:14:04] SubarooWRX: probably somewhere in the contract, not a math thing
[8:14:05] Olvi12: it will but it's not that significant for 2%
[8:14:05] Turboz__: it is inflating thats why its good to buy now
[8:14:05] Ace1507: its just a scam, because he knows money vallue will skyrocket
[8:14:06] RealBalckeN: But i feel like you need the money right now
[8:14:06] funkyb88: BRUH U can’t trust that man
[8:14:07] cutz28: people with more productivity in game
[8:14:07] wildturkeyno9: Is your money securen on the property?
[8:14:08] BROKEN335: even worse for you
[8:14:08] caligirlbeaches: honestly Vee if you did that I would stop watching
[8:14:09] suspectmids: i mean atms can get you 5 percent is that not better passive
[8:14:09] andrefvm: No, it's only 10% of what you put in
[8:14:10] j_pandy: no, because they aren't offering any equity
[8:14:11] M0hkofantti: They dont give you anything from the houses they invest?
[8:14:12] xfirepop: just don’t trust other people with your money
[8:14:12] Ginoveli: if it goes up then price will skyrocket
[8:14:12] cravi: it goes up every time someone buys a house
[8:14:12] nykter1: over 5 weeks its a poor investment
[8:14:12] mavericks312: he makes 20k you make 2 k
[8:14:16] auxfrog: it will go up once the nicer houses become available
[8:14:17] Ginoveli: there is a good chance
[8:14:17] NickFromDiscord: I think it's a waste of RP opportunity with that same amount of money
[8:14:18] ImMahti: you're getting 10% of what u put in not the housing market :((
[8:14:18] Z3phs: seems the housing market has nothing to do with the investment
[8:14:19] Gundaree: housing market does not exist, I think you can only sell back to the city for half value? or at least it was in 3.0 like that
[8:14:19] silverarrows47: just depends on how inflation is handled in the city
[8:14:20] Dano_Leza: I’ve you sell the house back to the government you make that extra money towards a bigger house
[8:14:24] BlindFlapjack: you'll lose out if the prices increase by more than 10%
[8:14:24] Mouso9: Work with your crew for a better deal.  Do like 100,000k but they have to advertise your business to there tenants
[8:14:24] caligirlbeaches: you won’t make money
[8:14:30] HandofOdd: Was that some of your money too?
[8:14:31] ironbullman: In this city 5 weeks is just tooo long man
[8:14:31] darkrosslol: does the contract say he can adjust rates based off inflation
[8:14:33] Damzexx: that passive income u make in a hour over 5 weeks
[8:14:34] isp1337: he makes all the upticks of the housing market and his rents, you make just a staticish small part of it

[8:53:05] ItsNeeks_: don’t let Jason touch it lol
[8:53:07] Guielme: this floor should be leveled with the stair, that would make possible for 3 floors

[8:53:13] ChaseBands_: it doesn’t even take long lol
[8:53:14] LePichu: And you can see it from the outside
[8:53:15] AgadhiTheGreat: Alex was just trying to get things started, he didn't have the materials to do what he really wanted
[8:53:16] blackdoos: if you put it up 1 more it would show
[8:53:17] Crewcabanger24: if the floor was higher it was sticking outside
[8:53:17] NoLuckWithNames: Jason asked Alex to make three floors, if I remember correctly.

[8:53:28] bridgesblike: Pog you can make a meating room
[8:53:28] Thunderpint: So they could "hide" things
[8:53:29] ArtemisRost: if u move hieghts around a bit maybe you can manage 3 floors
[8:53:31] Tenivir: it feels like a very temporary thing that noone done anything with
[8:53:31] Clodhoppr: it could be yes
[8:53:31] Alaineman: It is, but it's a little cramped
[8:53:32] tradgie: the top floor is too tall
[8:53:33] Mr_Tvi: The low ceiling triggers me
[8:53:33] symanpt: they wanted a hidden floor for crim stuff

[8:53:46] mootywooty: it just could be done so much better
[8:53:46] Pizkhalif: they wanted 3 for illegal stuff, but at this point its not worth.
[8:53:46] Mackn9ne: yea
[8:53:47] simmeringteapot: that house is a nightmare
[8:53:47] nikulaz_: mostly all the other houses are built as 3 floors
[8:53:48] Kangaroo_Balls: wtf, theres a gap
[8:53:48] doworkid1: should take all the car stuff from bottom out tonight  @acie
[8:53:48] GRAYURSUSTANA: its really not unless you are a hobbit
[8:53:49] Mackn9ne: it is
[8:53:50] annitamaxwin: yes
[8:53:54] H311nBRAND: It is big enough but the top floor alex moved too low because he is hiding half the floor under the ground check the editor lolll
[8:53:54] Stewy21: A bunch of people have divided their house into three floors and it does work. The top floor should be higher
[8:53:54] exaven: !tag
[8:53:54] JustAboveYou: And people said they can see inside your house because of that
[8:53:54] StreamElements: doctor_yakub teg you're it peepoRun
[8:53:55] FrankkDawg: Alex just did whatever
[8:53:56] itsjustfantasy: It cost monet and they were broke after buying the house.
[8:53:59] andrefvm: Thats because alex wanted to save and only use 3 slabs
[8:54:00] mrbouda1: all the houses are like this thouhg
[8:54:01] kr4kk3nn: the floor is done in pieces
[8:54:02] Yudee: @Acie jsut hire Dexx he will fix everything
[8:54:03] Xerhro: Tell Alex to fix it
[8:54:03] henry_r3: Don't move floors with PS's on it
[8:54:06] isp1337: use for what?
[8:54:11] Raivolver: you could raise upper floor abit and would make it better, but 2 floors is the best bet
[8:54:13] onlypapz: check the house panel @Acie
[8:54:16] bridgesblike: yeah that bother eugene too
[8:54:18] funkmasterflexi: time for Vee to rebuild :P
[8:54:19] Kangaroo_Balls: its definately worth the 15k or so to decorate, you guys spend a lot of time there
[8:54:20] elM0ppy_: Alex did the best posible thing you could do with what you had
[8:54:20] FrankkDawg: Other houses look pretty dope inside if done right
[8:54:21] Machinist757: Raia shoulda been a linebacker
[8:54:23] proleteric: @Yudee Dont trust that guy lol
[8:54:23] ConnorDangerCash: I think you can also expand the house downward to have more vertical space
[8:54:24] ArtemisRost: yeah you need to move stuff to bottom floor and erase it all
[8:54:26] elmangoust: @Yudee yeah ask him how to make the secret room, and start from there
[8:54:30] LePichu: @tenivir alex wanted to do more stuff with it but everybody refused to do anything with it
[8:54:32] Stewy21: The top floor should be higher, then 3 floors would work
[8:54:33] qihk: with the gpu racks you only need 1 pc
[8:54:37] raizzel_azzer: call dex he can teach you how to decorate the house
[8:54:39] qihk: so saves space
[8:54:41] ingridktravels: most people just hire people to do it since it is such a pain in the ass
[8:54:49] bluff1n: wtf

[8:54:53] Thunderpint: That's a decent smount
[8:54:56] Genisyys_: i think so floors dont clip outside house
[8:54:59] Clodhoppr: Alex made it work in the short amount of time he had
[8:55:00] qihk: Now that you guys got the gpu racks you can focus on decorating
[8:55:03] AFFABLE__: dexx offered stairs shrug
[8:55:06] Alaineman: It's because the walls that are used a xl. and it's for the secreft basement
[8:55:07] mk46s: alex willing to do it but no one call him and give money for it
[8:55:10] STONASESS: dont move any floors
[8:55:12] KnocturnalSLO: Need new stairs first
[8:55:13] elM0ppy_: 2 floors with a secret room is the best
[8:55:14] rxratatat: It's pre build
[8:55:14] Stewy21: The top floor should be higher, then 3 floors would work 󠀀
[8:55:14] uDen1s: there is someone in your house
[8:55:15] HandofOdd: @raizzel_azzer Bro gonna want a fee
[8:55:16] bluff1n: raia can turn off the stairs in the console
[8:55:17] noermark1: i think raia can remove it from the panel
[8:55:19] andrefvm: The stairs are default
[8:55:20] blackdoos: it was just a rough first sketch, but no one chipped in to finish the house so it was left like this
[8:55:21] ToTheSameHeights: OMEGALUL
[8:55:21] SeanFromOhio: @Acie I think the stairs are default in the house
[8:55:22] funkyb88: noraexDisgust
[8:55:22] cawood899: you change stairs from the panel
[8:55:23] nikulaz_: its a spawn point
[8:55:23] Tresch: Acie, you can design the whole house in the editor and then you see in the shopping cart what to buy. You dont need to do it in real time
[8:55:23] RealWicari: owner can remove the stairs from the tablet by the door
[8:55:24] isp1337: staircase is in the terminal
[8:55:24] Tenivir: ghost monkaW
[8:55:25] jesleaks: The stairs were the only thing in the house when they bought it
[8:55:26] proleteric: @GRAYURSUSTANA not trusthworthy, they need to be only ones knowing all this
[8:55:28] ArtemisRost: owner gotta do stairs i think
[8:55:28] ironbullman: Alex is the only one theres floors in the house or it would have been uglier LUL

[8:55:53] Stewy21: @Stewy21 Others have been able to do it though... so there must be a way
[8:55:53] nikulaz_: yeah the house comes empty with just the stairs but even those can be removed
[8:55:56] rxratatat: Yeah, maybe Raia can move the stairts through the console
[8:55:56] DragonSage2008: Aww no trash bag on top of his head this time erican2Crying erican2LuL
[8:55:59] kr4kk3nn: the stairs were there when he bought it

[8:56:05] AgadhiTheGreat: Tell Raia to check the panel
[8:56:05] Xerhro: Aye at least you got a couch
[8:56:07] FrankkDawg: look at the house panel
[8:56:12] kriptom10: ya they dropped like 200k in a single day to make the house and put floors
[8:56:13] LePichu: There would be no floors if alex didnt tell yall to buy floors honestly
[8:56:13] FrankkDawg: for the stairs
[8:56:14] ToTheSameHeights: and whats with the scuffed bathroom
[8:56:15] butlerian_jihadist: Yes, he didn't have much time or resources
[8:56:18] ChaseBands_: the 3 floors is fine it just wasn’t done right
[8:56:19] kujoez: you dont really need 3 floors tho right @Acie
[8:56:19] hangryzai: Only owner can remove the stair
[8:56:20] Ted_Zack: i think yall should collect like 20k+ and just buy stuff for making the house look better
[8:56:23] tradgie: change it and fix the floor heights
[8:56:26] Tresch: Its expensiv tho, a wall cost 500$ a whole cute house is 20-40k
[8:56:27] Mr_Tvi: First floor should be in line with the front door
[8:56:28] Tenivir: yeah
[8:56:28] TeaOnline: the top floor should be higher to the door level maybe
[8:56:30] henry_r3: stairs is like 10k
[8:56:30] Boogyclutch: you can change the stairs
[8:56:31] spyzizme: you should check the outside, the inside floors are sticking out
[8:56:32] vaipesz: finally someone noticed the door is unlocked
[8:56:40] ironbullman: Can you show whats in the rack
[8:56:40] StreamElements: ironbullman, no
[8:56:40] Tenivir: the stairs is horrible usage of space
[8:56:46] Crewcabanger24: didn’t they give you the key?
[8:56:48] 1_bex: top floor needs to be higher
[8:56:51] KnocturnalSLO: 40k is not that much money
[8:56:54] blackdoos: @Mr_Tvi issue is it will poke to the outside and you will see it above ground
[8:56:55] Alaineman: It's just basic modelling software GUI. Anyone who has ever used 3d modelling software can do this
[8:56:55] Living54: pcs on bottom floor is smart
[8:56:55] andrefvm: They fit
[8:56:57] Liink93: only owner can change the stairs no ?
[8:57:00] RealWicari: racks will never fit down there
[8:57:00] KnocturnalSLO: To make it look good

[8:57:01] Webb903: You dont need a bathroom at all
[8:57:02] bigtex494: The third floor was hiding please move
[8:57:02] nikulaz_: when you redeisign just change the floor layout completely and it wont matter
[8:57:02] Machinist757: server rack not fitting down there
[8:57:05] isp1337: you remove the floor
[8:57:08] andrefvm: You could make rooms for each of you
[8:57:09] kr4kk3nn: you will probably need to measure the height of the building if even possible
[8:57:10] Tresch: like carmella will do thier house in 3h for 30k
[8:57:14] ArtemisRost: I think hes saying it so you can erase all else without worry @acie
[8:57:16] GRAYURSUSTANA: server rack would go through the ceiling
[8:57:19] Beltano: server racks need higher ceilings
[8:57:23] zackr: poggie woggies\

[10:34:55] umudoffy: The cop that yelled was higher ranked than them. She was a senior. Thats why they are mad too.
[10:34:58] LogiqueGaming: Really depends on the context/situation. You should see the interactions between Ray Mond and Gigi hahaha
[10:34:58] j_pandy: @unstoble1337 you just seem overly invested in insisting you know it's OOC when you aren't that person
