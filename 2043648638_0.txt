[2:52:32] adzse: The lluvia de peces ('rain of fish'), is a phenomenon that has been occurring yearly for more than a century in Yoro, Honduras, in which fish are said to fall from the sky! The explanation generally offered for the rain of fish is meteorological, often speculated to be strong winds or waterspouts from the nearest marine source of water which is the Atlantic Ocean, about 45 miles away. Although there is no real explanation for this phenomenon. dizzTHINK
