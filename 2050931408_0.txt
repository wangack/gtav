[7:44:47] minnmor: @sinister_wolfe i use same style of writing
[7:45:14] MAZM0L: i can type fast but i can't type quick and accurate.
[7:45:16] ZalenaStar: we got taught it in 6th form, not school per se
[7:45:19] sinister_wolfe: no i learned the proper hand position in like 9th grade playing typing games in class, but by then i have been typing for over 9 years the wrong way
[7:45:42] MAZM0L: what is the proper way chat?
[7:45:48] Dagarul: i remember being taught in school.. while still using floppy disks to save our school work.

[7:46:08] 0Laetitia0: my tech teacher was a dragon about it, was wondering if it was a common thing
[7:46:22] sinister_wolfe: i think that my advantage is that i memorized the keys and it is completely muscle memory, had to actually look at how i typed while typing in a note document to see how i actually typed
