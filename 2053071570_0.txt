[0:53:14] MadChemistTHC: wonder how many devs NP has
[0:53:18] NemisizZ: im sure theres a method to it, but think its flawed regardless, like the humidity, the entire place shoulda had a default humidity, like 70% or something random, and then ppl had to use dehumidifiers to put it into the range where its good, instead of starting from 0

[1:48:09] Bulfwyne: Salt i haven't really messed with but kinda curious
[1:49:15] Polkaderp: It was probably some guy's superstition that wasn't proven wrong
[1:49:18] Polkaderp: So it's worth doing
[1:49:18] vourbs: How could you park there and stop them from doing their grinding grrr
[1:49:22] vourbs: LUL
[1:49:24] NemisizZ: shitbucket Kappa
[1:49:26] cobalt076: i typically use salt depending if i want a heavier bait that'll sink faster
[1:49:27] slorebear: spitoon ??
[1:49:31] Bulfwyne: yeee, its TOLD as a myth but I'm sure its got a flavor fish like
[1:49:32] MyBudyVegas: yes
[1:49:48] Bulfwyne: Nice EZ
[1:50:19] Bulfwyne: like I've done my craws with a sinking plastic and claws with a floating plastic and they stand up
[1:50:28] xl__8s: what 3d printer are you looking get
[1:50:28] vourbs: Did you finish the lure bp?
[1:50:34] MyBudyVegas: are you printing the molds?
[1:50:51] Bulfwyne: Mine from BugMolds took like a week and a half or so
[1:51:01] Rekcams: Resin printing
[1:51:04] FubarSilver: I use an anycubic resin printer i love it
[1:51:22] MyBudyVegas: copy
[1:51:22] NemisizZ: so, resin is very brittle, just so you know
[1:51:27] Bulfwyne: cause they ship from ukraine to germany and stuff and since with the war, they are driving stuff by trucks and stuff
[1:51:31] FubarSilver: yeah the wash station too
[1:51:34] Bulfwyne: yea
[1:51:35] NemisizZ: washer and uv curing
[1:51:39] FubarSilver: well wash & cure
[1:51:41] FatBored: You might have trouble with silicone and resin prints, it can cause silicone to not cure
[1:51:45] Bulfwyne: really crreamHm
[1:51:46] NemisizZ: lol eu is on fire bud
[1:52:03] NemisizZ: half of eu is in protest, with blockades and all that
[1:52:04] AquaJawa: yea the UV was is essentially cures the resin
[1:52:17] Bulfwyne: they did tell me since the war and stuff things are slow, but i'd contact them and see if they can see
[1:52:24] NemisizZ: yeah
[1:52:39] FatBored: There's ways around it but yeah
[1:52:42] NemisizZ: telling you, get a FDM instead
[1:52:53] NemisizZ: all the vids i watched with that they used fdm
[1:52:53] Bulfwyne: yea
[1:52:58] NemisizZ: yeah its the spool thing
[1:53:06] FatBored: People do cast molds from resin prints, but you have to seal it with something else
[1:53:08] GETAFlX: time to learn pottery!
[1:53:10] Bulfwyne: nah cause its a process with resin
[1:53:14] NemisizZ: resin is just good for high details, like figures and that
[1:53:18] Bulfwyne: gotts wash, then cure with UV light
[1:53:33] Bulfwyne: yea Resin is mainly used for TableTop game stuff
[1:53:41] xl__8s: bamboo lab have some pretty cool printers
[1:53:42] NemisizZ: fdm you get all those funky materials like nylon and carbon reinforced and that fuzz
[1:53:52] NemisizZ: bamboo is all 1000 dollars or more
[1:53:53] Bulfwyne: but you CAN make baits with it, but gotta coat it so the silicon actually sets up
[1:53:58] Bulfwyne: which is why lots use wood
[1:54:02] Bulfwyne: like that Marlin Baits guy
[1:54:22] FatBored: @Bulfwyne exactly, If you're dead set on the detail you can get from resin, there are still ways to cast it
[1:54:34] Bulfwyne: I tried silicone molding a few baits, and the baits actually melted and caused the silicone to not set up
[1:54:48] Bulfwyne: oh yea deff @FatBored
[1:54:56] frigginoasis: !fuck
[1:55:07] slorebear: confirme tail too canadian
[1:55:08] frigginoasis: !joke
[1:55:09] Nightbot: Don’t interrupt someone working intently on a puzzle. Chances are, you’ll hear some crosswords.
[1:55:26] Bulfwyne: yea that looks sexy
[1:55:36] slorebear: how do get the hooks attached ?
[1:55:48] Bulfwyne: screw locks a good way @slorebear
[1:55:56] slorebear: oh you can just screw them in
[1:55:57] slorebear: ??
[1:55:59] Bulfwyne: tiny screws that you twist with a hook attached
[1:56:07] Bulfwyne: yea i hand make screw locks
[1:56:07] SlinkyMcMasters: run a hole through the top lip to underneath to create some bubble action while it swims
[1:56:24] NemisizZ: id use a wire that goes through it from the line to the hook tbh, cuz if its printed odds is its gonna break
[1:56:32] Bulfwyne: they are the best for baits cause you only need a 1/4 inch screw and it holds the bait really well
[1:56:38] FatBored: apparently there's this shit you can get from SmoothOn called InhibitX that fixes the cure issue
[1:56:42] Bulfwyne: yea some have been putting line through them too
[1:56:47] Bulfwyne: specially in japan
[1:56:49] Nightbot: stay up to date on shit - twitter.com/travpiper | instagram.com/travpiper
[1:57:27] Bulfwyne: @NemisizZ ever seen the Inu Rig from japan ?
[1:57:29] NemisizZ: im thinking you can bend some steel wire so you can tie ur line to it and then have that go through the lure down to the hook, so the hook technically is directly tied up to the line still

[1:57:44] NemisizZ: @Bulfwyne nah
[1:57:49] Bulfwyne: yea that'd be good
[1:57:55] Bulfwyne: gives it a great flow in the water
[1:58:06] Nightbot: check out my merch at https://dotexe.com/collections/travpiper
[1:58:15] NemisizZ: but with a fdm printer, you can pause it mid print, then you can add ur weights and what else u need to add and then continiue the print
[1:58:39] Bulfwyne: @NemisizZ also wire through a bait will hamper the movement, so putting a hole through then a  normal line through with a trebble hook or a hook, is what people do normally
[1:59:23] Bulfwyne: yea its like a canvas
[1:59:25] NemisizZ: yeah true, but think if you just screw it into the bait, then it might just rip out of it
[1:59:36] Bulfwyne: i bought a few baits like that, and they rip/tear
[2:00:00] Bulfwyne: thats why i like the joints cause they can be fixed
[2:00:03] NemisizZ: actually, could prolly use some chain
[2:00:14] Bulfwyne: Ooooo
[2:00:21] Bulfwyne: i haven't, that sounds great
[2:00:47] Bulfwyne: PogU

[2:01:31] slorebear: stormageddon hits LA in like 3 hours
[2:01:33] Bulfwyne: yea i've been making 6 inch robo worms lately, been just starting drop shotting, doing 2 hooks
[2:01:53] Bulfwyne: oh you got places that can 3d print stuff for people ?
[2:02:07] FatBored: There's prob a ton of community maker type places around you
[2:02:09] Bulfwyne: oh thats sweet
