[8:45:08] 3p1cMexican: they pay less i think? I dunno for sure but siz has heard from others that you do the bank at a loss.
[8:45:49] KingpinKza: the fleeca is just a step to get a dongle that lets you hit the bigger bank which probably pays alot
[8:45:50] Adamkaotyk: they making it more of a longer setup and skill I guess for a rp role so people will watch it
[8:45:52] astralhollow: @SuperHolyCow you need the dongle though to do the other banks, and you make the profit there it looks like

[10:10:05] CplDarkeye: maybe there is always a line of 1 that is close to the bank and then the long line of 4?
[10:10:46] JackTehSippah: @friedmombo  Then why would the bank still be at 80%? That'd be my question if that's what it was
