[0:43:38] stillbaALin: He will endup with some sick prison RP
[0:43:39] IraqiWizard: yeah cause they car swap 12 times a chase OMEGALUL
[0:43:40] Blizzard5050: Ironically, because he got away too much, it all stacked up

[0:43:41] SoulYou_: @Deansocool thats why he got 3 days in jail now, the crimes kept piling on

[0:43:51] DaviMury: You dont tbh

[0:44:40] Mickow94: Prison RP with Bobby Charles? @deansocool
[0:44:40] IraqiWizard: @Deansocool the problem with big crimes like this is the charge stacking.. its too much
[0:44:40] Kerviel_: Actions have consequences, there is a reason they upped the fine and time on PD equipment, a number of people got banned for that
[0:44:41] mavericks312: play stupid games win stupid prizes
[0:44:41] slymox: what rp is there in jail? way different consequence

[0:44:54] Narva95: ICANT
[0:44:54] Kryptonautti: @Deansocool Just do some prison rp with Carmine and Bobby.
[0:44:55] SIRDELTARP: @Kerviel_ The hot gun got him 5 hours in jail compared to the other charges, bro is a full-time streamer you basically gave him a 3 day suspension
[0:44:55] watsondubbox: @PrettyKrazy LK is a shitlord?

[0:44:59] Gachiguru: @foc_stark he had a HOT GUN on him
[0:45:00] Metalcalfe: That's what they get for handing a gun around. They catch all the charges when one of them gets caught.
[0:45:02] Aledz_: ICANT
[0:45:02] captain_steve_420: Justin Kidd got 21 days

[0:45:08] TopicTech: jail time is in game minutes, right?
[0:45:08] mavericks312: @iraqiwizard everyone of his charges are deserved though
[0:45:08] lMarioSBl: it was a Botched interrogation by slacks and cornwood arguing in front of him. They wanted to give him less time through RPing and getting info., but it took like 3hrs to decide what to do pissing Mr.k off
[0:45:09] foreverpandas3: the fine should be heavy and reduced time
[0:45:10] MeggidoMuneblaze: the return of Richardson maybe?

[0:45:28] ryanahmed1000: people saying he should use a different gun, the issue is the hot gun equated to 15% of the 3 day time, two charges got it up to 3 days
[0:45:28] FilzG: SNIPER
[0:45:31] billy_bob05: @Gachiguru @Gachiguru yeah I saw that. However, they're encouraging cops to just be murdered nonstop instead of an actual RP scene with them. Like that one with Tessa was going to be

[0:46:39] fenr33r: it already is
[0:46:39] FhyberzEBK: yo
[0:46:42] VexV1: saab tried and judge told him to put both charges
[0:46:42] DJ_Cubed: they did, but still stacked
[0:46:44] kusaaaal: or a counter to dna
[0:46:46] judydredd: thats what slacks tried to do
[0:46:47] eXceLenT_: @Denraoden yes-man guy with 21 days in the hole TrollAware
[0:46:47] Gachiguru: @billy_bob05 nobody is encouraging cops to be murdered he got caught and has to serve the time. The server doesnt encourage gang v gang violence by denying other crews of heists
[0:46:48] Dromaius_: they tried to lower the charges but he regused
[0:46:49] DaviMury: They did
[0:46:49] Bigdan2140: K literally said in the interrogation he would of gotten off lighter shooting slacks infront of someone in MRPD compared to what he got
[0:46:51] fenr33r: but letter of law is that u use all charges
[0:46:51] Bigeyez: K's mistake was picking up the PD gun. Just doing that doubled his time from 1700 to over 3000 minutes
[0:46:51] Janizki_Fin: @Deansocool  I think the gun he had on him was hot to 5 cases.
[0:46:52] beastly_kush: yep
[0:46:52] jinnytolls: No, you can rob a cop and choose what to take @Deansocool
[0:46:52] chaosKahn: it is
[0:46:53] TopicTech: the problem is the two charges are written in a way that they both can be stacked
[0:46:54] mikageval: @fenr33r it isnt
[0:46:56] advancedwolverine: they did, but still stacked
[0:46:57] IraqiWizard: @mavericks312 there is no deserved bro.. it doesnt really matter, content and RP is all that matters, and 3 days in prison is fucked, just discourages people from doing big crimes which is the opposite of the point
[0:47:00] antreids: But it wasn't it was separate situations
[0:47:00] mavericks312: the fact that crane was in Saabs chat last night saying wtf you doing was great
[0:47:01] skupinb: they stacked two huge ones, i dont think they should have
[0:47:03] HadEbola: @TopicTech yes
[0:47:05] Mickow94: @Deansocool "Just" dont steal the PD equipment? 4Heed
[0:47:07] Newname_5: @Denraoden well also i think there's also a difference in presence within the server
[0:47:07] captain_steve_420: Crane said not to do that
[0:47:09] fenr33r: look at robbery oif gov. employee
[0:47:10] ChromaticNova: That means you can go crazy and still get just that one charge
[0:47:11] BKBiggy: blanket and pieces.
[0:47:11] Pown77: you know that you can hit shift+enter and it puts fullscreen ?
[0:47:11] Baileybrad: that’s what slacks tried to do but cornwood came in
[0:47:15] Cheexur: it was all part of the kidnapping which includes the possession but they said no
[0:47:17] Janizki_Fin: @Deansocool  The gun was hot so he got those too.
[0:47:18] TheOGWombat: lol ssaab tried that and Cornwood overruled
[0:47:20] DaviMury: Cornwood make a point that you cant stack and it makes sense, its on the letter of the law
[0:47:20] chmod_R_777: DOJ and Council can NOT legislate crime out of GTA RP... numbers are out of control rn
[0:47:24] BKBiggy: but they would be seperate charges
[0:47:24] GRAYURSUSTANA: just dont do crime in roleplay Dentge
[0:47:25] chaosKahn: kidnapping and robbing a government employee is one charge
[0:47:26] modooc56: you cant compare tazer mag or spikes to a pd gun
[0:47:28] ClutchMoses: Slacks was trying to do a blanket charge of just robbery with having possession removed. This is what caused the 3.5 hours of debating
[0:47:29] ryanahmed1000: saab tried but cornwood said they should put the 2 charges
[0:47:31] kvnater: slacks tried but cornwood wanted all charges listed
[0:47:32] progressislife: it was gonna be 1 blanket charge but cornwood helped in adding more kek
[0:47:32] trizziturbo: robbery
[0:47:33] xGotNoClout: MAX prison time should be one day unless they add more content around prisons
[0:47:35] Bigeyez: No Crane specifically wrote those two charges to be seperate
[0:47:36] kennyt1001: bruh, that first one you hovered over is most of the time
[0:47:37] mavericks312: @iraqiwizard play stupid games win stupid prizes
[0:47:37] DoseofDewey: he had spikes too lol
[0:47:38] Doqx42: @judydredd Slacks messed up though that he tried to remove charges and then had nothing he could remove when Mr K wanted to negotiate.
[0:47:43] FilzG: no they are different
[0:47:44] Divine_Saint: Why not give crime option to turn prison time into cash payout
[0:47:46] Gundaree: were those the two charges they called a judge over? and said it was designed to be charged together
[0:47:49] trizziturbo: Robbery
[0:47:50] Fossabot: If your enjoying the stream smash the DAMN follow button! I mean shit its just a click away... Might see your name on screen ;)
[0:47:50] juanelemichele: But he had a gun that was used in 5-6 other crimes
[0:47:53] Laxgoalie1829: its just crazy he wanted to create content for the PD and another and instead caught a 3 day jail sentence
[0:47:53] DJ_Cubed: "robbery" included taking the weapon
[0:47:55] slymox: plus robbery
[0:47:55] VexV1: @Deansocool saab tried, cornwood called a judge to confirm and judge said to charge with both, so he got two 1440 charges
[0:47:56] den0vo: He refused to negotiate because he felt PD was negotiating in bad faith, this chat is on something wild
[0:47:57] fenr33r: @Deansocool no look at robbery of gov employee, it is a b;anket
[0:47:57] Bigeyez: Nekoda confirmed Crane set it up that way on purpose
[0:47:59] IraqiWizard: @mavericks312 thats the dumbest take on RP i have ever heard. congrats
[0:48:00] lKouRa: stacking
[0:48:01] m4l1kkk: He'll make prison entertaining
[0:48:01] thricerice1: why is Saab don't know how to charge people anymore that he needs to ask a judge everytime
[0:48:01] Clivent: actions have consequences
[0:48:02] DaviMury: The pd interrogation was so bad, cornwood and slacks disagreed on how present the charge
[0:48:04] clairefleuret: the thing that would suck is getting charged with 100k for a baton
[0:48:05] bobbybedstains: its alot of time
[0:48:05] foreverpandas3: @deansocool in my opinion they literally should make the fine upwards of 250-300k just for robbing and keep the time reduced so even if they’re caught they serve the little time they have then have to “grind” to pay off that 250-300k in the city because prison doesn’t have much
[0:48:06] thesmoogers: @Deansocool What if they increase the amount you need to pay to account for time after a certain period of time.
[0:48:07] twilightbaseballscene: cornwood wanted all charges added first then work it down from there, it makes sense
[0:48:09] RaverenZero: Is it 3 in-game days?
[0:48:09] xGotNoClout: @Gundaree There is, you can get lock picks in prison. Ramee made like 25k
[0:48:17] PrettyKrazy: long time coming. get got
[0:48:18] jinnytolls: Imo not alot of time for all the fucked up stuff he did IC
[0:48:18] Bigdan2140: @RaverenZero 3 real days
[0:48:19] m4l1kkk: @raverenzero 3 IRL days
[0:48:20] Benoit230: @RaverenZero irl days
[0:48:21] km56_: so how many daps since training school
[0:48:21] hodgedogg: Bobby and Carmine run prison now though right?
[0:48:22] WildWillie419: The debate was over adding PD gun possession in addition to Cop robbery
[0:48:26] MakiWind: He can do somethings with Bobby and Carmine in Jail
[0:48:27] LuckyNZ: it's 3 days spent in game right
[0:48:30] LuckyNZ: one lifer wont reduce the time?
[0:48:31] wastington: or maximum sentence time for the specific category
[0:48:32] CEO_of_DEO: that gun shouldve been thrown out he wild for using it again
[0:48:34] judydredd: @Doqx42 i dont think that was the issue really, its more that he ended up backtracking
[0:48:34] IraqiWizard: KEKW
[0:48:35] GRAYURSUSTANA: @juanelemichele those other crimes were nothing, just 2 of the charges which werent related is 2880 months and 100k+ in fines
[0:48:35] TheDev97: LMFAO

[0:49:31] chaosKahn: @iraqiwizard what’s the point of PD and laws then if they can’t charge the biggest criminal when they finally catch him? that’s the risk you run when you RP that character
[0:49:33] akonv3: @Kerviel_ thats actually pretty true

[0:50:56] Doqx42: @judydredd backtracking led to the end result issue, but when they were trying to negotiate first Mr K even said so there is nothing you can remove.  Then Slacks finally understood after Nekoda also confirmed the possession charge wasn't a stack.  Then they tried to then present it back to Mr K and then it was no recovery.  Even Cornwood didn't want to add it on at that point as it was already presented without it but wanted Slacks to understand the issue.

[0:52:08] ItzAHoax: @PrettyKrazy The scenarios that lasted 5 minutes? Cost 24hrs in jail? lmao its a content server
[0:52:12] anticosmos1: he is lying lol
[0:52:17] LazyMike: pepeMeltdown
[0:52:20] IraqiWizard: @chaosKahn You are taking what i said too far, no one is saying he shouldnt get much time.. the way the charges are setup, their fine and time is not logical, Esfand literally agrees

[0:52:28] captain_steve_420: He's not lying
[0:52:32] CEO_of_DEO: Pepega hes lying
[0:52:32] Bigeyez: Esfand was so frustrated feelsbadman. Now Mr K hates him too because to K it feels like Cornwood was stacking charges
[0:52:35] brook_cs2: DICK RIDAAAAAAAA
[0:52:35] skupinb: imo if you dont wanna charge him that way you should not have pushed idk
[0:52:35] Zorgc: is this hindsight andy? omE

[0:52:39] FilzG: thats how its supposed to be
[0:52:39] theblackdog808: Yeah
[0:52:39] chmbrs: that makes total sense lol very organized
[0:52:40] xl_scout_lx: He wasn't the charging officer though was he
[0:52:40] jinnytolls: Esfand is 100% in the right
[0:52:40] MexiBrent: he wants the roleplay to talk the charges down with the crim
[0:52:41] ghostdogg69: It was too many chefs
[0:52:42] Gundaree: yes you first inform them what they are facing
[0:52:43] CreepeAir: he was saying that for hours how is he lying KEKW
[0:52:43] ggrenben: esfand is a W and they treat him like he isnt trynna be a good dude
[0:52:46] akonv3: he yapped for 3 hours dean...
[0:52:46] Rebsdorf_TFT: cornwood always try to sentence people in good faith
[0:52:47] den0vo: Esfand tried hard to get it organized last night, not gonna lie, slacks kinda fumbled the delivery
[0:52:48] Blizzard5050: Slacks rushed things and things got messy
[0:52:49] MDM4ever1986HD: Esfand is right tho
[0:52:49] PeacheyMilk: his whole point was the he wanted to be a justice warrior after being a lawyer
[0:52:50] bertacharm: bartering shit down
[0:52:50] captain_steve_420: Slacks was being stupid and not listening to anyone
[0:52:52] WarrenPuffit: <message sent to jail for 50 hours>
[0:52:52] rabbyraptor: Yeah the so called full menu
[0:52:53] 16BitMonere: slacks fricked up the charges tho
[0:52:54] PrettyKrazy: @itzahoax if we nvl sure its no big teal right xdd
[0:52:55] TheOGWombat: if it was done FIRST yes
[0:52:57] DaCrazyHun: it wasnt that, he was just pushing for it so hard
[0:52:59] mrs_strawberryy: him and slacks should not have been arguing over charges in front of K
[0:53:01] Gachiguru: crims never snitch though pepeW
[0:53:03] slymox: Slacks jumped the gun and started negotiating from half the charges
[0:53:03] VexV1: the confusion was that saab already dropped possession charge without even explaining that it was dropped
[0:53:04] LogicWeasel: Cornwood tryin to help a crim, and the brain-dead crim chatters are still like "he's lyin bro" Pepega
[0:53:04] ItzAHoax: @PrettyKrazy who nvl'd? lmao
[0:53:05] twilightbaseballscene: he says from the lawyer side things get messy when cops skip steps like that
[0:53:08] KevinnTCG: They went in with like 1100 months, then updated it to 3200 after the fact, then tried to "work it down" from 3200 which made K a bit upset
[0:53:09] Zedael: Slacks started with less charges then tried negotiating so it ended up more charges got added after starting to negotiate...
[0:53:10] antreids: They never talked about why he kidnapped him to begin with
[0:53:13] theblackdog808: But that's too long in this short attention span age LUL
[0:53:14] juanelemichele: Honestly though, K may win on appeal because Cornwood was involved in the investigation and he was the victim
[0:53:15] stocker218: After #hr of bs k was over it
[0:53:15] DaviMury: Slacks fucked up the interrogation
[0:53:19] den0vo: @slymox 100 percent this
[0:53:19] Citystar619: cornwood lost alot of respect becuz he complained to much an how you got back on the force
[0:53:20] brxckk_ttv: yeah there were a reason for it, prop meta to say
[0:53:21] PeacheyMilk: slacks just needs to be able to see others viewpoints, because he just doesnt
[0:53:23] Bigeyez: @xl_scout_lx he was the charging officer. Slacks specifically told Conrwood to do the charges and then for OOC reasons didn't want to add the gun charge
[0:53:25] chmbrs: "i want to give him less time" " youre lying Madge "
[0:53:27] jinnytolls: Slacks messed it up instead of getting the stories and charges straight first
[0:53:32] LogicWeasel: @chmbrs LULW right?
[0:53:33] PrettyKrazy: @itzahoax kidnap cops for weeks go to jail for it. whats not to understand
[0:53:33] Zorgc: holy shit Pog
[0:53:34] Gundaree: slacks messed up jumped to the end dropping charges then to the middle and back to the start...that man should not interriogate
[0:53:34] captain_steve_420: Slacks shouldnt be allowed to be involved in anything CG related

[0:53:46] brxckk_ttv: This weekend that's irl?
[0:53:47] judydredd: @Doqx42 i agree thats what happened, but the friction came from slacks agreeing to work w k and eventually backtracking

[0:55:02] Bigeyez: @dj_cubed wrong. Nekoda confirmed Crane specifically wrote Robbeyr of a LEO and the PD gun charge were meant to be seperate charges and were not a stack
[0:55:02] shadowpuma23: You have to wait til shift 2 for your next session right?
[0:55:04] jas3370: just handle hostage processing dont get involved with the chase

[0:57:38] chmbrs: you werent pushing DNa just the fact he once had it on him

[0:59:03] aniquilattion: he was arguing that he dropped it on water and dan was supposed to be gone, but dan doesn't get cleaned up in 5 mins in the water.
[0:59:03] livenotonevil_: /me rubs off dna
[0:59:07] 16BitMonere: there should be something like special crim gloves or expensive stuff to get rid of dna but i feel like PD is alsways behind crim in mechanics and dna is the only thing giving them better leverage
[0:59:08] PrettyKrazy: its a flawed system, it is what it is
[0:59:08] tonysweg1: no dna LUL
[0:59:08] SpiritEX: xdd /me innocent

[0:59:15] m4l1kkk: Never has
[0:59:15] LogicWeasel: @Gachiguru agreed, DNA wipe should be like a clean station that is put in a crim's house.  they have to get it home first.
[0:59:16] Benoit230: @livenotonevil_ sumSus

[0:59:22] ashyybashyy: cornwood has a hit on him
[0:59:23] Niajayda: It's kinda wierd how slacks let's officers decide when he doesn't agree
[0:59:23] SkinnyNudist: dna can transfer from one hand to another and then to an object
[0:59:24] Fallen_Mist: they work for him and he robs them
[0:59:24] h0lk1: Fuck around find out imo
[0:59:24] M3RLN: he cant
[0:59:27] SpiritEX: he robs ppl 24/7
[0:59:27] Rob_573: he does the real estate stuff
[0:59:27] Switchblade142: @kotidestroyer DNA comes from more than just fingerprints is probably why that doesn't count
[0:59:28] samealb: Now they’re just going to shoot cops!
[0:59:29] Kasvar: EZ /me won the rp
[0:59:29] AshuraaLive: Nah he didn’t want to rob him, he was trynna disarm him. I think that’s why he was pissed off
[0:59:29] ConmanEU: there is nothing to for crims

[0:59:41] pathasahat: Cornwood doesnt do non-cop RP is the problem
[0:59:42] MDM4ever1986HD: KEKW
[0:59:43] TheLastRace: @Deansocool He started the telemarketing thing with Cornwood when we ran for mayor
[0:59:45] 2unami: He legit does no grinding
[0:59:47] TheOGWombat: rob cop 1440 minutes.  rob civ 20 minutes
[0:59:47] FreakTheMedic: @deansocool he made it 24 with his pardon
[0:59:47] PacGamer: I don't know why K did it right after doing all that shit for a pardon. Like would you not value your time?
[0:59:47] x_amer__: rob what he needs LUL
[0:59:48] UrClassicDerp: can shoot cops and get less time, make it make sense LUL

[1:00:04] theonlyfb_moose: took cornwoods phone and car and gun and DIDNT ROB?????
[1:00:05] chmbrs: @pathasahat did you miss the last 2 weeks of his rp? it was all off duty lawyer LUL
[1:00:08] PrettyKrazy: thats how it is when you kidnap cops for weeks ICANT
[1:00:09] evilmnkey4: the old apartment?
[1:00:12] CreepeAir: YEP
[1:00:13] LogicWeasel: @Gachiguru fair, let the sharks guard it LUL
[1:00:16] juanelemichele: Once cops start getting shot that charge will go up, easy
[1:00:18] PrettyKrazy: thats how it is when you kidnap cops for weeks ICANT they increase the penalties, what is so complicated
[1:00:18] Clivent: you think i care LUL
[1:00:18] thatguydancingintheclub: and you know what the best thing is .....because there was a dolphine in a game put in a pool  and died
[1:00:20] torms17: it's to prevent cops from being like a walking loot box
[1:00:20] Gr1mington: Is that what this was?
[1:00:22] theblackdog808: At least have a little risk LUL
[1:00:22] SkinnyNudist: i think cops would get robbed less if guns werent half a house
[1:00:25] jinnytolls: Cop loot = more powerful than just shooting a cop, you go to the hospital and youre back on your feet. PD gear can terrorize many people
[1:00:26] m4l1kkk: It was part of a larger story foheadCry
[1:00:27] iCLUTCH193: The RP that was gonna go down was going to be SO good.

[1:00:29] tbdd0601: they have an armory of cop guns KEKW
[1:00:30] Gundaree: a robbed cop is way worse the gun can be used in multiple shootings
[1:00:31] Kasvar: lebronJAM
[1:00:32] Switchblade142: @UrClassicDerp Because realistically robbing a cop does a lot worse than just shooting them in this server
[1:00:33] LordMannZ: you wouldnt rob a cop irl so how is it an option here?
[1:00:34] washreyacolmsatt: god dammit, rhoades is on league now
[1:00:35] h0lk1: cops shouldn’t be lootboxed, how can ppl not understand
[1:00:37] ghostdogg69: He dropped it in a stream
[1:00:38] p0mms: already have
[1:00:38] MOCMike: there was an RP reason to kidnap ihim
[1:00:38] PrettyKrazy: thats how it is when you kidnap cops for weeks ICANT they increase the penalties, what is so complicated. the same will happen later when he just kills them, the charges will increase then ICANT
[1:00:39] xGotNoClout: I think you should scare people through fines not 3 day soft ban
[1:00:39] Dromaius_: If cops are getting robbed all the time, they aren't available to fill their role in the server.
[1:00:39] jinnytolls: Holding hot guns for so long is dumb on their part
[1:00:40] Gmoneyusmc: There is a story line to it @Deansocool
[1:00:41] tbdd0601: they have an armory of cop guns, you just dont know ic KEKW
[1:00:41] Kerviel_: It's a valid and legitimate charge and time, it was getting out of hand and they kept raising the time and fine
[1:00:41] Janizki_Fin: @Deansocool  Cop gun was cornwoods, he had a hot civilian gun on him
[1:00:43] Fadamaka: he disarmed Cornwood
[1:00:44] TheOGWombat: he didn’t “have” it in his possession

[1:01:01] ItzAHoax: It is supposed to scare people, but its so overbearing that you can't even make an RP scenario with a crim and a cop anymore. Or you get 24hrs. @Deansocool More crims need cop chars and more cops need crim chars.
[1:01:01] el_dia8l0: In a lot of servers robbing cops is a instant ban cuz its so OP
[1:01:02] Niajayda: I love dundee

[1:01:19] gevan8710: He should have just ran off when EMS showed up in the first place. Not thinking it would be called in right away was just bad. @Deansocool
[1:01:19] Gundaree: @elite__dog it is not black or white....be creative as a content creator?
[1:01:19] slight621: Dundee cracks me up
[1:01:22] SimplyGaia: People also dont understand all the laws are being changed constantly as things happen. If cops start getting shot a lot more then the law regarding it will be changed just like the robbery one
[1:01:22] antreids: Mr. K made 5+ cops jump off a bridge and get away with nothing. It is just easier to go up and shoot a cop then taking one hostage, probably why the fine is swayed that way. Tis video game btw

[2:10:14] Alekdk1: @spicyville I was just about to say the same thing LUL
[2:10:15] mrchainsaw13: People still on this
[2:10:20] PrettyKrazy: the reason kidnapping is worse is because nobody actually gets perma murdered... its awkward
[2:10:30] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: kebunBBW
[2:10:31] improvisablex: People need to just stop robbing PD and they wont raise the chargess. Itss that simple
[2:10:34] Steelhuf: Crane is the main character
[2:10:38] psylongti: I am looking forward to Crane/Max reaction to K charges the day after the pardon
[2:10:39] Aledz_: PepeLaugh jolteck
[2:10:39] CreepeAir: yea NODDERS
[2:10:44] Janman88: alot of punishments are as the ramee clip showed actually quite in favor for crims
[2:10:45] Provost69: another 3 min of ads i just had it 15 min ago i cant anymore..
[2:10:45] TeaOnline: thats why he has nekoda, malton, and other people to talk about them with.
[2:10:47] Tsilin: Anything other than a HUT is capped at a day possibly.
[2:10:48] talgach: Eugene should be the Assistant Chief
[2:10:48] PrettyKrazy: its a balance thing overall, not just about k
[2:10:50] Janman88: i mean would be bad if not
[2:10:51] SephirothPhenyx: YOU KNOW
[2:10:53] puddypounce: it's pretty clear they don't want people robbing cops
[2:10:56] AsuniRS: what else are we supposed to talk about
[2:11:01] FilzG: yeah it is
[2:11:03] SoLDiER510: Idk don't get caught is #1 rule
[2:11:06] Shane_Martin1992: DNA I feel needs re-working, need a way of getting rid of DNA ect.
[2:11:09] Toluen090: Crims need risk for the reward
[2:11:11] sexy_peach_on_twitch: glad to see you back in PD
[2:11:13] Steelhuf: more clips
[2:11:13] UAxolotlQuestions: @improvisablex people are suprised when crims treat pd like lootboxes(look at superchargers) and then get rules in place to stop it
[2:11:14] Toluen090: If they get caught
[2:11:15] Zayrow1: most crims know what they're risking when commit certain crimes
[2:11:17] OprahSideMan: the ads are getting ridiculous, every 15 minutes I get between 6-8 ads
[2:11:19] yaboiporkchop: @improvisablex robbing pd is better content than them robbing grinders over and over lol
[2:11:19] Nubbz1992: I think for RP Charges are fine its just the time served. a day time out in the jail which has very limited rp feels wrong they are content creators as well and some people don't want to make another life in the city
[2:11:21] Janman88: are u a really a crim if u never get caught and do time?
[2:11:32] antisociajay: antisociajay subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months! 
[2:11:33] Janman88: stand point makes alot of difference prolly
[2:11:33] FilzG: @Zayrow1 which 90% of times is nothing
[2:11:34] yungnams: What if derollo told ruth she lied ruth just ignored it Susge
[2:11:35] TeaOnline: They dont want cops being held up all day every day. The crazy time is how they stop that

[2:11:44] BDG_Toa676: Thought that was K13rzz alt for a sec
[2:11:46] improvisablex: Robbing RP is both lazy and boring. It's forcing "RP" to what you want then to do.
[2:11:49] TheLlamaTrainer: He dont care
[2:11:50] SoLDiER510: Yea perfect criminal never gets caught

[2:11:57] Dash_O_Pepper: I think he goes for Slacks first.
[2:11:58] PrettyKrazy: prison needed more dev time before they made days long prison even possible, nothing to do but farm lockpicks and only until recently...

[2:12:10] SchumiU: Hmm
[2:12:11] ken_kaneki_og: who is your fav crim?
[2:12:11] psylongti: Why were they trying to kidnap Cornwood anyway?

[2:12:26] talgach: warra cook
[2:12:27] sexy_peach_on_twitch: mr k was just pardoned right?
[2:12:28] hunterspt: the best criminals never get arrested
[2:12:29] PrettyKrazy: Aware hell week is coming
[2:12:31] Pravolution: Mr K river dumping himself is perfect KEKW
[2:12:31] FatGirlDrunk: K exposed how weird the laws are written. Its less time/fine for attempted murder of a cop than it is to have him drop his stuff in a glovebox.
[2:12:32] BDG_Toa676: Fr a politician
[2:12:33] yungnams: any jjk enjoyers?
[2:12:33] Alekdk1: Let him land chat
[2:12:35] xGotNoClout: In the eyes of the law you are not a criminal I guess LUL
[2:12:36] SoLDiER510: Yea look at me i hot clean record HahaReindeer
[2:12:38] Ard______: hold on let him cook now
[2:12:38] Dee__1__: makes you a very smart criminal lol
[2:12:39] Shane_Martin1992: Going to be another Sam Bass moment
[2:12:44] Requay: they just had to steal gun and gear and they would have been fine :P
[2:12:44] SoLDiER510: Got*
[2:12:46] Guielme: yo
[2:12:49] FilzG: nah
[2:12:53] CreepeAir: undercooked
[2:12:53] OprahSideMan: Mr.K should have never kidnapped cornwood IN FRONT OF EMS 😂😂 that was the issue , he was sloppy
[2:12:55] TheFiku: best criminals are the politicians like nancy palosy
[2:12:55] BDG_Toa676: @yungnams a plethora of jjk enjoyers in ere
[2:13:01] FilzG: yeaaaaa
[2:13:02] P0ndi: denzel gets a month off work for doing his job mr k gets 3 days in jail for serious crimes dont seem fair but hard work out i guess @Deansocool
[2:13:05] talgach: Cooking on snow
[2:13:07] serioushustle: cooking with the gas off
[2:13:08] docshaayy: @Janman88 then they should create another character for brand new refreshing content.
[2:13:16] Shane_Martin1992: @TheFiku Or the UK government at the moment
[2:13:16] CreepeAir: to be the perfect crim just be the mayor Aware
[2:13:23] xSnip3x: ow Cornwood 100% getting shot  from what i watched it is more worth your time to shoot a cop than kidnap them @Deansocool
[2:13:24] KappaManJason: imagine snow was an fto
[2:13:25] enser27: people acting like Mr K wasnt trying for 3 days to kidnap cornwood Lol
[2:13:28] Alekdk1: you were cooking. The result was just under cooked
[2:13:28] cleanstrikes: yea the PD punishments on most servers is so harsh @P0ndi
[2:13:29] Zinzio: @P0ndi Such a bad take. Being in Jail with no RP does not equal not being able to do PD.
[2:13:30] SoLDiER510: My brother not even blood would do life for me no joke bruh
[2:13:31] badperson1234: he should have just told him to throw his gun away imo.
[2:13:34] SecretChiley: @FatGirlDrunk I mean, i think thats more for the RP. Very rarely do characters get Perma'd. Taking people's stuff is a lot more punishing
[2:13:37] yaboiporkchop: the one thing I missed with the K thing yesterday, was it EMS that tipped off the PD about kidnapping?
[2:13:45] Shane_Martin1992: K even said he'll just shoot rather than rob now.
[2:13:47] heat31: Having both Ramee and K get caught to the extent they did is going to bring a lot of aggression towards the PD @deansocool
[2:13:51] The_Arrival_: @yaboiporkchop Yes
[2:14:08] FilzG: Kappa

[2:14:22] cleanstrikes: STACKED
[2:14:23] talgach: Clueless yeah man
[2:14:23] TeaOnline: @Shane_Martin1992 then they will buff the attempted murder of gov employee charge.
[2:14:23] OprahSideMan: @yaboiporkchop yes , that’s the only reason K got caught tbh , he was sloppy
[2:14:24] TheFiku: Clueless  and the aim to back it up?
[2:14:25] Dee__1__: @badperson1234 he did but for some reason picked up the gun before leaving
[2:14:25] ctsblindsniper: Aware  So ready
[2:14:27] xSnip3x: PD is not ready for hell week @Deansocool
[2:14:28] TheHoll0w: KEKW

[2:14:39] SoLDiER510: I think your one of the best cops good cops can relate to it
[2:14:40] Ronnification: shift 1 is down bad
