[3:24:44] marc_avec_un_c: muck spaghetti, created by the mud scientist
[3:24:52] IboRobotosis: is there a reason they're saying muck? is that a british thing?
[3:25:03] IboRobotosis: or like a slight against mcdonalds?
[3:26:09] Safetytrousers: Florida, Italy and the Philippines still do Mcspaghetti
[3:26:28] IboRobotosis: really, italy?
[3:27:07] marc_avec_un_c: @IboRobotosis it's osie's accent, bouphe would probably say it even worse

[3:27:24] IboRobotosis: though to be fair i'm in canada and we have "poutine" from places like mdonald's
[3:27:54] IboRobotosis: @marc_avec_un_c ah ok. were the others just taking on the same pronunciation then i guess?
[3:28:25] marc_avec_un_c: @IboRobotosis yeah they were probably teasing her, sorta like when pedguin pronounces words wrong
[3:28:38] IboRobotosis: bodeh
[3:28:51] marc_avec_un_c: exactleh
[3:28:52] IboRobotosis: i getcha

[3:30:34] DragoonMouse: I love seeing Zoey in more TTTs but would love to see her in GTA vides too
[3:31:07] IboRobotosis: maybe just not her games? i don't think i remember her being in any gta vids
[3:31:32] DragoonMouse: she is in a few

[3:47:12] marc_avec_un_c: ohh super slow race, so intense haha
[4:01:54] Magmarashi01: I like Lewis' assumption that they could have just CGI replaced an entire actor without having to pay the modeled actor at all
[4:03:50] marc_avec_un_c: really
[4:08:01] IboRobotosis: we're getting there, mag
[4:08:01] JaffaMod: Thanks to PCSpecialist for supporting the channel. Powered by the GeForce RTX 4080. Get Â£30 off your order using the code YOGS https://pcspeciali.st/yogscast
[4:08:29] Magmarashi01: Not what I said
[4:08:58] Magmarashi01: Lewis assumes you could do it without having to pay the actor to use their likeness, so it would be cheaper
[4:09:25] marc_avec_un_c: lewis assumes lots of things wrong though
[4:10:07] Magmarashi01: Yeah I find it funny

[4:10:14] IboRobotosis: again, we're getting close to that reality where actors aren't paid in perpetuity for their likeness
[4:10:50] TehFlatline: I doubt that.
[4:10:57] Magmarashi01: Nah
[4:11:08] IboRobotosis: you think tupac was paid posthumously for his holographic concert appearance?
[4:11:22] Magmarashi01: his estate was
[4:11:30] TehFlatline: I imagine his estate was, yeah.
[4:12:40] IboRobotosis: yes and as tech evolves the kinds of considerations will change for what actors are paid for
[4:13:58] marc_avec_un_c: you know it's a super old video when Ben's named superking
[4:14:21] TehFlatline: Or Tom's in it.
[4:14:41] marc_avec_un_c: that too
[4:14:44] Magmarashi01: I miss Tom
[4:14:57] Magmarashi01: He hasn't been the same since...
[4:15:00] Magmarashi01: The Incident
