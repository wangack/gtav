[0:51:20] REMONSTERttv: I gotta have fast paced fps chaos.
[0:51:22] lobasweat: you see that controller config post on twitter?  if not go look! its insanneeeeee
[0:51:34] Bogobec: Yeah, that's crazy
[0:51:38] MALiiBU__: Thats so depressing
[0:51:40] CRlCK: do you even use twitter anymore that shit's foul now
[0:51:41] TDK718: 30% off? Kappa
[0:51:47] wikxy_: i deactivated my main coz of twitter tbh, deleted the app on my phone too
[0:51:47] MALiiBU__: And deflating
[0:51:50] iprayformyzen1: How as ur day been
[0:52:00] iitzmememe: any new org yet?
[0:52:01] REMONSTERttv: They could make steam disable it
[0:52:05] BlazinAzn: @LuluLuvely they can literally turn it off on steam. From their side they click one button and they're off
[0:52:06] Tenyson05: !twitter
[0:52:06] StreamElements: Follow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/lululuvely
[0:52:06] TongasJost: And they don't seem to care
[0:52:07] MALiiBU__: Probably
[0:52:07] GayGoldenRetriever: Wait what's a config??
[0:52:10] SebasBP28: @CRlCK she does, Isometimes comment
[0:52:20] Pepe_Chuckles: luvelyHmm
[0:52:29] CRlCK: elon has been doing some great shit with twatter
[0:52:39] MALiiBU__: Make em do ittt
[0:52:42] Tenyson05: @gaygoldenretriever  configurations
[0:52:43] TongasJost: Basically they don't care
[0:52:45] SebasBP28: luvelyHiya ellyyATail
[0:52:49] TDK718: @gaygoldenretriever steam has button customization
[0:52:50] wikxy_: the problem is fucking the system well all be capped at 60 frames
[0:52:50] CRlCK: smart choice
[0:52:51] REMONSTERttv: I think what steams input system does is an intercepts any controller inputs and injects new commands directly before it goes into the game. At least that how it stayed in what I read about it
[0:52:53] MALiiBU__: Unless they want their game to continue this slow death
[0:52:55] BlazinAzn: I think they're leaving them on and veiling it as "accessibility" but they need to do something
[0:52:58] MKUltra1: The configs are an issue
[0:52:59] fraumatt_: @CRlCK LMAO
[0:53:04] REMONSTERttv: But yeah they could make steam cut it off with like one flip of a switch
[0:53:15] GayGoldenRetriever: Ohhoh I see thanks chat
[0:53:21] 7Calibers: luvelyBan
[0:53:21] SebasBP28: Definitions and Terminologys are phase 1 on every gane
[0:53:24] lobasweat: its all about money... look at the deathbox and sword. :(( the greatest battle royale is now so weird. the power creep of legends.. condiut is almost as fast as octane.. its silly.. buff the OG legends..
[0:53:27] wikxy_: coz if we turn configs off we cant do config to get unlimited frame cap
[0:53:34] wikxy_: its a shit problem
[0:53:42] CRlCK: 3-5 min i'd say
[0:53:43] Bogobec: @CRlCK KEKW
[0:53:43] babelonian16: Depends
[0:53:44] MALiiBU__: Seems like Apex has new management
[0:53:45] CRlCK: not long at all
[0:53:46] Lank: Hello Queen!
[0:53:48] REMONSTERttv: Why not just make all inputs have the same movement then there wouldn't be an excuse for configs whatsoever. So everyone can tap strafe which is a critical part of the game, but no one gets to do the crazy configs that break the game
[0:53:51] Iuciia: few minutes
[0:53:52] BayBossTycoon: pretty quick, few minutes
[0:53:52] briggins: 5 min
[0:53:53] MALiiBU__: Bc it def is weird mow
[0:53:55] MALiiBU__: Now
[0:53:57] babelonian16: There is a queue as well when it comes back
[0:54:11] 7Calibers: how’s your day going Lulu?
[0:54:15] XoPrim: did i miss the rp stream
[0:54:16] TDK718: can they even make turning on/off the configs for a specific game so that it doesn’t effect Steam as a whole? luvelyHmm
[0:55:35] wikxy_: all g were waiting for np servers to go up anyways
[0:55:39] iSleepyk3: twatter is also more hilarious to say
[0:55:42] REMONSTERttv: It's done that the two inch boot styles have differences in the way that movements. All input styles should have the same properties minus the aim assist versus no aim, assist debate, but without a doubt it's easier to aim with your arm than your thumbs
[0:55:44] Koo87: I saw it on reps twitter if it's the configs tweet you're trying to find
[0:55:59] tempie: showing twitter monkaBruh
[0:56:00] BlazinAzn: and then they never got rid of it lmao
[0:56:01] Deathbolt: luvelyDinkdonk luvelyHi
[0:56:03] wikxy_: oh right ya
[0:56:05] Lank: LUL funny tweet
[0:56:20] MALiiBU__: Sheesh the memory you have
[0:56:23] MALiiBU__: 2021??
[0:56:26] marin5290: retweet it again lmao
[0:56:27] SebasBP28: Innaceptable is my disregarding ingorance to them, dear respawn
[0:56:32] REMONSTERttv: That hella old tweet didn't they come back and say they were leaving it in the game after everyone Complained
[0:56:33] BlazinAzn: They realized after tweeting that that they couldn't remove it because it's possible due to physics the game is built on OMEGALUL
[0:56:35] SebasBP28: Hell to Apex
[0:56:42] Lank: had to double check to see if that wasn't on April 1st
[0:56:52] jpbenji9: Wigg luvelyIQ
[0:56:56] robbi_rotten: typical apex not following up on what they tell us they'll do
[0:56:56] ILordRichard: the game is dying for real this time
[0:57:02] iSleepyk3: respawn back at it again with the claims $$$
[0:57:29] BlazinAzn: I still can't believe they got rid of punch boosting. Literally the best and most accesible movement tech in the game
[0:57:34] Lank: I would say I think its time for Apex 3 LUL
[0:57:41] CRlCK: respawn praying on our downfall that's why
[0:57:42] robbi_rotten: they only care about money not the game quality
[0:57:44] REMONSTERttv: Yeah, there's something with the engine itself that is built on that gives the ability to tap strafe just like the speed running tactic of jumping against the wall at a certain angle gives in other games also works in this one and it gives you more momentum than running
[0:57:47] Lank: 2*

[3:39:21] StreamElements: Backseating & meta gaming is annoying and ruins the experience for everyone. Do not try to get Lulu to do things ingame, or tell her what is happening from other RPers POV as it is against the rules, everything needs to be learned naturally through RP.

[3:41:56] Sugu: yeah most people crank that mic volume thing

[3:42:49] SebasBP28: and I will trash talk that other giy
[3:42:55] OHRAYSAN: No turn up all of them, SFX would be quite when someone is talking.. it's weird
[3:42:55] TimPetrik: sfx during VC is that when you talk nature noises get lower
[3:42:56] percentage47: what do you put in your tea normally : )
[3:43:01] imrolandordz: icons on bottom left will show if your mic is activated when you speak as well as hunger and stuff.

[3:45:08] csaszar07: luvelyPray
[3:45:12] CRlCK: poppins pretending like he don't speak and hear english perfectly
[3:45:22] LucidxGrimz: @tdk718 lol I like that cat emote

[3:46:54] LiLFLaMe8: Your character looks early Y2K coded lol
[3:46:55] xfuzzyslipperz: I would recommend a mouse button tbh
[3:46:56] iWishiWasWeeni: DinoDance
[3:46:58] jester__25: LucidxGrimz RIP owa owa
[3:47:00] wikxy_: texture budget around 70%, population density and variety 50%, extended texture budget as high as your computer can do without ur frames going to wacky
[3:47:07] OHRAYSAN: Use one of the mouse buttons for PTT. It's a lot easier.
[3:47:07] crazyiitopii: Hey chat did we warn our streamer that there are some really weird RP chatters just be Aware
[3:47:12] xfuzzyslipperz: It works perfectly
[3:47:19] iWishiWasWeeni: What drink did you get? luvelyCute

[3:47:27] LiLFLaMe8: Has she started actually RPing yet?
[3:47:32] CRlCK: No
[3:47:32] wikxy_: motion blur and bloom usually i turn off in games, hurts my eyes for long sessions
[3:47:51] fraumatt_: @LiLFLaMe8 yes she's RPing drinking a smoothie
[3:47:52] crazyiitopii: Just be prepared for more weird that normal chatters all I'm saying
[3:47:53] SebasBP28: luvelyEvil

[3:48:04] Zefram0911: oh. you always got that stuff going on
[3:48:06] LucidxGrimz: Did you know nervous and excited are the same feeling with negative and positive mentalities
[3:48:08] LiLFLaMe8: @fraumatt_ oh period
[3:48:08] CaptainDirtypants: we call that the Three B's smoothie

[3:48:30] SebasBP28: o I joined ALlie's discord and put her on the same folder where you are, folder on discord named Lulu KEKW
[3:48:47] xfuzzyslipperz: I would recommend mic settings as well. The game mic audio is usually set to loud.
[3:48:51] SebasBP28: folder: Lulu, Ava, tempie, Melibela, Allie, Claraa
[3:48:53] TimPetrik: arrow keys to navigate to other settings down
[3:48:54] Greenmaniac12: !backseat
[3:48:54] StreamElements: Backseating & meta gaming is annoying and ruins the experience for everyone. Do not try to get Lulu to do things ingame, or tell her what is happening from other RPers POV as it is against the rules, everything needs to be learned naturally through RP.

[3:50:22] SebasBP28: Vegapunk just knows science
[3:50:22] md783: you’re good to go
[3:50:24] OHRAYSAN: Changing other graphics would make you restart game.
[3:50:33] wikxy_: but if it gets too wonky scale it down as you go for the distance scaling

[4:43:43] Sugu: !backseat
[4:43:44] StreamElements: Backseating & meta gaming is annoying and ruins the experience for everyone. Do not try to get Lulu to do things ingame, or tell her what is happening from other RPers POV as it is against the rules, everything needs to be learned naturally through RP.

[7:46:55] StreamElements: Backseating & meta gaming is annoying and ruins the experience for everyone. Do not try to get Lulu to do things ingame, or tell her what is happening from other RPers POV as it is against the rules, everything needs to be learned naturally through RP.
[7:46:58] binglederrytv: This is wild. We are literally watching someone who is working for minimum wage at a fast food joint in game with other people who are doing the same, all of us are doing this to escape the grind of real life.
