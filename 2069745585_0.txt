[2:16:12] Rare__Potato: W Slacks take
[2:16:20] RobRoads: It really is. I think at this point i'm leading to the Den side. But slacks can't back down at all
[2:16:20] talamah: Corpa
[2:16:23] Krimson07_: there are literally no labor laws in the city and theyre talking about unions OMEGALAUGHING
[2:16:35] MaSTerSOra701: I would love to see slacks fire 7 people
[2:16:36] Slasher2099: @Connorbrow sure take it to court you win nothing cause there are no labor laws
[2:16:37] Eddie1225: all this spicy rp is great
[2:16:41] Eddie1225: chat makes it not fun tho
[2:16:41] Zanethereaper: den is chill this is your other officers voicing their feeling and views im liking the rp
[2:16:42] Eddie1225: OMEGALAUGHING
[2:16:43] stellarnaut: @Krimson07_ there is a labor law tho
[2:16:44] MaSTerSOra701: ^
[2:16:44] StreamElements: What they said saabThat
[2:16:47] ShinJiHun: @Slasher2099 this isn't IRL where labor laws exist LUL
[2:16:49] Slasher2099: what people don't understand is that los santos is not america
[2:16:52] Slasher2099: KEKW
[2:16:54] dakota22446: LULW
[2:16:57] Connorbrow: @Krimson07_ There are, it was added the day after Johnson got fired
[2:16:58] M3disyn: wait til he's back in 2 weeks OMEGALAUGHING
[2:16:58] c0rnishatheart: KEKWexactly
[2:16:59] StreamElements: Please do not meta in chat, which means do not tell Saab stuff happening in RP that his character would otherwise not know.
[2:17:00] Count_Brennuvarg: monkaW why is today Judgement Day
[2:17:09] Connorbrow: @Slasher2099 There are
[2:17:12] RobRoads: RobRoads is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to Ssaab's community! They've gifted a total of 2 in the channel! 
[2:17:12] RobRoads: RobRoads gifted a Tier 1 sub to iz_juju! 
[2:17:14] just_james69: Yeah den took it so well, he is positive about the whole thing
[2:17:16] shaunbell19: @ssaab where are from
[2:17:21] c0rnishatheart: Denzel is probably delighted with the outcome it could have been so much worse
[2:17:23] WildWillie419: Denzel gonna be back without his friends Sadge
[2:17:24] bigray72: bigray72 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! You know what bothers me. Is there are 2 other captain's but you seem to get all the flack from it
[2:17:29] WildWillie419: MAGELLEN
[2:17:36] wonder8er: @RobRoads its lowkey good for den, he will come back with no daps
[2:17:38] focustft: Den is great - excited to see him Shift 2 academy
[2:17:41] rclemon_: @bigray72 Nah Ruth def gets it worse HEHE
[2:17:41] BluebonnetRP: interesante
[2:17:46] TheTourist_: Leo Flack mhm
[2:17:53] MaSTerSOra701: Sign me up, i'll get on right now and write tickets Kappa
[2:17:59] kyux3: this is bigger than the firing, that was just the assassination in Sarajevo
[2:18:02] RobRoads: Right!
[2:18:08] lookingfornothinghere: Its day 27 of the Union Aziz and Cornwood have handed in their badge and their guns. At the same time Denzel is starting his first shift after being rehired.
[2:18:09] Krimson07_: same OMEGALAUGHING
[2:18:10] Mogs3: Thank you Ssaab
[2:18:12] just_james69: I think dens attitude today speaks volumes about his position in the pd in the future
[2:18:13] ShinJiHun: @bigray72 you literally can't type the name of one of the captains becuase of her being a scapegoat LUL
[2:18:14] Klint03: LUL
[2:18:15] Artsii1994: Denzel got the best deal possible
[2:18:18] Slasher2099: so what happened ? did he get fired fired or send to academy KEKW
[2:18:29] MaSTerSOra701: Denzel had a good attitude
[2:18:29] Faildude: @RobRoads and on shift 2 instead of 1
[2:18:37] focustft: @Slasher2099 He got fired but he's coming back for shift 2 academy
[2:18:41] RobRoads: Why not just keep him suspended rather than fire. I mean he's going to be back soon.
[2:18:41] Eddie1225: also people dont know firing is best
[2:18:42] MsFreya_x: @Slasher2099 both
[2:18:43] Eddie1225: no daps
[2:18:45] Artsii1994: @slasher2099 he got fired but in two weeks can come to shift 2 acdemy
[2:18:47] BluebonnetRP: zoomin
[2:18:56] Krimson07_: watch den get hired back and all the people that went 42 get fired RIPBOZO
[2:19:02] Slasher2099: so basically he can be a cop in like a few days
[2:19:09] Slasher2099: why are people crying about it then
[2:19:14] dakota22446: OMEGALAUGHING
[2:19:15] focustft: @Slasher2099 Pretty much
[2:19:22] c0rnishatheart: its just a suspension and return as a cadet with no daps
[2:19:26] MaSTerSOra701: no one really asked Denzel's opinion @Slasher2099
[2:19:28] SilentStormAU: @Slasher2099 cause they want him now BabyChat
[2:19:28] dakota22446: cause theyre delusional
[2:19:28] Artsii1994: @robroads beat to learn from your mistakes and come back refresed without getting more daps on top
[2:19:30] tanksly: @Connorbrow It does get worse every day. They are people and deserve a break. Their absence will be felt at the cost of the people of this city.
[2:19:36] ShinJiHun: @Slasher2099 same reason they've been blaming the captains for all that's wrong in the world LUL
[2:19:37] MaSTerSOra701: they just "heard" firing and reacted
[2:19:38] Ned15: Bones is so good
[2:19:50] Artsii1994: @slasher2099 chat just loves to spin the narrative
[2:19:56] Baileybrad: I think making him wait 3 hours to get fired rubbed people the wrong way
[2:19:56] CuBanMumzy: Brian comes in as CoP, thats what i would like to see, people would losing their freaking minds, lol
[2:20:13] ShinJiHun: @CuBanMumzy GIGACHAD
[2:20:16] BluebonnetRP: whats the story behind the guy running
[2:20:16] Slasher2099: we all fuck up Den just fucked up more i mean it's normal
[2:20:22] Krimson07_: Drake great comms cadet
[2:20:24] MaSTerSOra701: at least we get a lot of Slacks Driving today
[2:20:24] Rare__Potato: Nice one OMEGALAUGHING
[2:20:30] lookingfornothinghere: DAP
[2:20:31] Artsii1994: @cubanmumzy i dont think brian is gonna come back anytime soon will see
[2:20:40] Slasher2099: people used to cry that cops never got any punishments and now they do and people already pitchforking and torching
[2:20:41] MaSTerSOra701: Slacks wont be stuck in the office today Kappa
[2:20:41] Ned15: Really good coms
[2:20:42] rclemon_: People acting like not making him wait 3 hours would have changed the outcome ICANT
[2:20:44] Slasher2099: KEKW
[2:20:45] talamah: even if he had to wait why would someone feel they need to personally battle for him in other twitch chats
[2:20:57] ShinJiHun: @Artsii1994 not after that 20 hour stream LUL
[2:20:58] CuBanMumzy: @Artsii1994 i know but a girl can dream, lol
[2:20:59] lookingfornothinghere: Damn this cadet kinda straight fire
[2:21:03] Eddie1225: chatters always care more than the streamer
[2:21:07] Eddie1225: its the natture of rp
[2:21:09] M3disyn: her comms NODDERS
[2:21:09] Rare__Potato: I don't think Brian wants anything to do with PD command anymore OMEGALAUGHING
[2:21:10] Baileybrad: @rclemon_ you still respect other peoples time no?
[2:21:13] MaSTerSOra701: Scout by far is the best car with a turbo
[2:21:17] MaSTerSOra701: I think
[2:21:17] focustft: these cadets are really solid already
[2:21:19] Lucsvm: WHAT A BOX
[2:21:22] ShinJiHun: @talamah you new here OMEGALAUGHING
[2:21:25] RexPappa: @Slasher2099 thats kind of reductionist, everyone wants a fellow officer that they like back in the force, and to have him fired for seemingly arbitrary reasons its in bad taste for other characters. Plus his firing was posted for everyone to see in the MDT, which is bad for morale
[2:21:26] Lucsvm: LETSGO BONES
[2:21:30] rclemon_: @Baileybrad Ok and he apologized to Den
[2:21:31] Artsii1994: Scount good with the coms
[2:21:35] Zanethereaper: Bouncing watching so many things @ssaab  keep up the good RP
[2:21:39] totnumbb: Release the cadets!
[2:21:44] Lucsvm: that box was insane good
[2:21:46] rclemon_: You're just here complaining on an RP chatracters behalf ICANT
[2:21:52] ShinJiHun: essaying
[2:22:02] Connorbrow: @Slasher2099 Slacks actually said that he was being fired "to make an example", Denzel wasn't judged on merit at all. He was fired because they could, not because he's a bad officer.
[2:22:02] talamah: @ShinJiHun no, just rephrasing the question someone else asked to try point out how absurd it sounds
[2:22:16] tanksly: @RexPappa Yeah morale is bad right now, and I think that's the biggest oversight.
[2:22:25] FSouza_01: holy paragraphs pepeW
[2:22:30] ShinJiHun: a good officer with 10 dap points HmmCouncil
[2:22:40] Krimson07_: LookUp
[2:22:47] focustft: chatting?
[2:22:50] xTurqeh: who is the cadet on comms
[2:23:00] Slasher2099: @tanksly what morale cause 1 cop got fired ?
[2:23:02] focustft: @Christiannnnnnnnn not sure but she's really good
[2:23:02] lookingfornothinghere: The female cadet has really good comms who is that
[2:23:17] icarusdjr: @FSouza_01 tbf you type like 2 sentences in chat and it looks like an essay
[2:23:26] Klint03: juked
[2:23:34] rclemon_: Took your ankles ICANT
[2:23:40] Ned15: Cadet doing work already
[2:23:44] TheTourist_: peepoGiggle
[2:23:51] RexPappa: I think its fair cuz people try to paint it like "lmao why you mad," but thats trying to dismiss the issue
[2:23:55] MsFreya_x: @rclemon_ wonder if this guy took denzels neck too
[2:23:59] lookingfornothinghere: Slacks ankles modCheck
[2:24:06] Rare__Potato: EZ

[2:24:35] MaSTerSOra701: Instant PPO promotion Kappa
[2:24:43] timedoggg: slacks should get a 3rd cadet and just spam them at crims, and never get out of the car
[2:25:02] Connorbrow: @RexPappa Yeah, there's lots of people involved and every one of them has a valid opinion in what's happening.
[2:25:03] MaSTerSOra701: oh fk the ammo
[2:25:10] TheTourist_: it's a shame all 5 cops on screen have such low morale FeelsBadMan
[2:25:16] tanksly: @Slasher2099 It was the straw that broke the camel's back. There's been a lot going on with the whole sherrifs office thing. individual officers are making power plays.
[2:25:29] rclemon_: @TheTourist_ Im about to lower chat morale saabEvil

[2:26:20] Artsii1994: Duncan is a mence in desgise
[2:26:29] TheTourist_: "let's see who this really is"
[2:26:31] DCSeth: @CuBanMumzy went off duty to do crime it seems
[2:26:38] Krimson07_: DESKCHAN
[2:26:39] focustft: "I'm gonna go do it again"
[2:26:41] Connorbrow: @Slasher2099 I don't think this has anything to do with the sherrifs office. It's just officers upset at the way the "Leadership" is handling things.
[2:26:50] lookingfornothinghere: Jsyzon polamb wins again EZ
[2:26:55] Ned15: Is the ping late af ? LUL
[2:27:28] gabsensei: how many people are on duty right now?

[2:28:50] djhyzel78: dang!!!!
[2:28:59] MaSTerSOra701: they would of had to have like 8+ people
[2:29:04] MaSTerSOra701: and be gone
[2:29:05] Lucsvm: THATS SCUFF NO WAY
[2:29:22] SarahFlare: Holy shit
[2:29:32] MonsterFuel: @ezrem2 lemme guess it was just the "Dap Squad" that went off duty KEKW

[2:30:28] Ned15: Mateo GoldPLZ
[2:30:40] MaSTerSOra701: It seems scuff
[2:30:42] Lucsvm: this looks so scuff
[2:30:45] MaSTerSOra701: like the doors werent "relocked"
[2:30:45] Lucsvm: all 7
[2:30:56] tanksly: @Connorbrow I think the Dap narrative has linear consequences, leading to this revolt, but I also feel like other disillusions have fortified their malcontent. I feel like most of leadership usually makes the right call, but when one mistake is made, the cards fall.
[2:30:57] smc_303: Do cops call their cars cop cars? lol

[3:02:41] ArdentCause: Honestly that might not be a terrible plan lol youll get everyones respect ten fold tbh
[3:02:42] Artsii1994: Man will be back in two weeks its nit the end of the world
[3:02:44] Guielme: well, he had that attitude since 0 daps, he should never lost the job in first place
[3:02:46] RonJon: @buddha_hands yeah but high command review determined he wasn't worth keeping :\
[3:02:48] starlectric: it feels like everyone is getting mad on his behalf
[3:02:53] buddha_hands: a couple times he might've learned the wrong lesson but that's everybody it seems peepoGiggle
[3:02:55] SulhBatarnak: essaying
[3:02:57] just_james69: Question, after the academy I'm guessing den has a full reset on daps etc?

[3:03:35] MaSTerSOra701: wth is that
[3:03:36] MaSTerSOra701: LOL
[3:03:44] Connorbrow: @CuBanMumzy Example: Germany switched to Coal and shut nuclear plans down, despite coal being objectively more dangerous. They did that because people have a negative view of nuclear because of largely publicised disasters.
[3:03:49] just_james69: @krimson07_ bots
[3:03:50] Drkdream: NO WAY
[3:03:51] TimmayHS: It's kinda inconsistent cause a lot of the stuff people have been dapped for, others haven't been dapped for. Pitting for instance. Lenny got to do 30 minutes of cleaning instead of a dap

[3:07:18] Krimson07_: are people getting dap for doing their job or cuz theyre fucking up constantly
[3:07:20] MaSTerSOra701: Slacks allows a lot of messing around to be honest, he just expects when its necessary you get serious.

[3:11:34] mad0monk: I mean yeah it's just RP, but at the end of the day, most of the people playing on this server make their money from streaming them playing on this server, so chat can hate on me, but im not wrong

[3:12:31] MonsterFuel: @mad0monk that's a terrible take that gives the streamers ZERO credit... so you think their only talent is RP??
[3:12:31] ShinJiHun: As a professional RPer of 69 years, heed my advise Ssaab
[3:12:32] MaSTerSOra701: tinted windows KEKW

[3:13:47] MaSTerSOra701: This cadet is good
[3:13:50] TimmayHS: @mad0monk Koil isn't taking a direct role this time around, but in the past he allowed SBS stuff and has stated that it's a content server. It's not surprising that this stuff is happening because people still think it's a content server.
[3:13:50] MaSTerSOra701: quick on the reaction
[3:13:52] lora1969: being suspended or fired can bring a great character arc too
[3:13:53] Switchblade142: @JesusGVG I mean I get that but I can also understand that some viewers may watch someone primarily for their character
[3:14:10] talamah: man
[3:14:24] JesusGVG: @Switchblade142 i mean the character also doesnt get executed, they are still alive and can do things LULW

[3:17:51] mad0monk: I feel like a big part of the argument is that it's a video game but I think that argument goes backwards because yes serious RP is needed but it's a video game and people still want to have fun playing the game. And it is a content server, I mean 25% of it is owned by XqC so there needs to be a line between content and serious RP

[3:33:36] FuZroK: @Jibry 45 days I believe is the goal
[3:33:37] skillzz: bro was only sbs to like HC and Command lol
[3:33:41] wavep987: Yeah, maybe Cornwood and co. can negotiate DAP system to be a bit more relaxed. That could be a middle ground.
[3:33:44] mavericks312: out of the supposed 100 cops only 10-15 get on an shift 1 is a ghost town for a reason
[3:33:50] Tarushaffxiv: i was up all night last night
[3:33:53] Kiester_Felterbutts: Searching without a warrant = DAP

[3:34:09] BobFromAccounts: I feel like Shift 1‚Äôs captain should have been present. That‚Äôs really my only gripe DAP system aside.
[3:34:10] CeIoron: @Jibry just seems a bit much that running in the halls is comparable to mag dumping or high speed pits

[3:35:44] BobFromAccounts: I understand that, but don‚Äôt schedule it at the end of shift 1. or reschedule to a time that they could have been present. Shift 3 captain is understood on LOA so that‚Äôs fine

[7:55:54] BladesofICE: Yea
[7:55:54] robertsmithjr: i feel like if a 3 month mayoral position could control who is in charge of pd, i think that would be really disruptive
[7:56:05] shamison1: i think shes in trouble for being the one why he mainly got fired, and not even turning up to the meeting where he got fired

[7:56:17] Eddie1225: @shamison1 how
[7:56:20] Justin_Jefferson_Stan: the PD is falling apart because the captains don‚Äôt follow their own rules. they make up rules for certain people. Captains and Senior Officers make up lies about people don‚Äôt get punished
[7:56:22] catfish_quackenbush: yea its too much on 3 captians, and its really a lot for you right now since your having to pull weight of others due to other issues
[7:56:26] panda_snack: Cletus is more than capable
[7:56:27] Eddie1225: when slacks agreeded to all daps and gave him like 4 of them?
[7:56:28] CopperKat: I mean there's enough crime in Sandy to warrant needing a PD for response times. That's not dividing the PD.

[7:59:36] dakota22446: the chatters who want 3.0 PD only saw a very brief version of the PD and have no idea how bad it truly got
