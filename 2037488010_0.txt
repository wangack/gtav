[3:29:55] JuhJimmy: ^^^^
[3:30:03] JuhJimmy: clearly have info others dont
[3:30:33] Defonicx: hardly
[3:30:34] exoqqen: @JuhJimmy nah sani has always been important, its just buddha knowing from prev versions of the server
[3:30:36] Kozrick: well anyone from past releases had some info, just have to put it to use
[3:30:44] Defonicx: it doesn’t take a genius to know materials are important LULW
[3:30:59] buhzee: ^

[3:31:36] Urvikarma: @exoqqen buddha did say he knows more, you just gotta trust that he won't use that information
[3:31:37] imtoolazytoputaname: mhm
[3:31:47] exoqqen: compared to G6 you def can get some more RP out of Sani, cause you interact when selling and stuff, as long as you dont sell to union
[3:31:54] gigamex: Is that a good idea? What if Petar hits Lang while you're with him?
