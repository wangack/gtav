[1:50:04] shanejo127: 4head about to ruin everything imo and I'm for it
[1:50:22] Picklz: 4head just likes his purple furry friend
[1:52:02] Chriss332211: nah 4head is right
[1:52:22] spoonfullofMusic: everyones friends with everyone in this city is what ming means
[1:52:34] Chriss332211: ming just take fannys side now everyone else comes second
[1:52:37] Moonsc: connections are always valuable
[1:52:42] Moonsc: gotta get right people
[1:52:45] ragorez: 4head shouldnt try to push into fannys territory tho, make deals with guns or usb or something
[1:52:55] akamrmenace: True
[1:53:02] trinimini10: @chriss332211 ming has been saying this for 6+  years lol
[1:53:10] onix146: but hold hands with 2 of the most powerful houses too
[1:53:18] shanejo127: Pretty sure the besties have a pretty good alliance with cg.
[1:53:22] onix146: its a hard one
[1:53:26] mortuusintus12: the issue is ming is holding hands with cg too
[1:53:29] ragorez: they give her business
[1:53:37] FizyIzzy: @onix146 can you explain this to me in GoT terms
[1:53:37] 5800x3d: Whats the point of weak allies? LUL
[1:53:59] mortuusintus12: yeager being an ally isnt weak hahaha
[1:53:59] jinxedluck: @mortuusintus12 thats cause they rob na storm money runners and made a deal
[1:54:03] spoonfullofMusic: @5800x3d cannon fodder duh
[1:54:04] checkmate_1234: Yeah and also your friends also have other friends...so u can't rob their friends too ?...u have to lookout for yourselves first
[1:54:08] onix146: Shruge not all the big dogs will have hands on everything
[1:54:09] bahartin: but still if the pushers are constantly buying weed from the crew, wouldnt robbing them impact their ability to continue doing business
[1:54:11] notgunnasub: A full wipe would of been so much better
[1:54:37] spoonfullofMusic: hey if they do civ jobs, expect to get robbed you know
[1:54:40] 5800x3d: @bahartin Pushers should fall in line thats the bottom line
[1:54:50] mortuusintus12: @jinxedluck 4heads point is if CG runs their own in time, will ming start robbing them ? like if the weed sellers are in a tough spot and run their own for the mean time
[1:54:54] bahartin: @5800x3d not wrong but should be warned first

[1:55:41] Moonsc: fanny feelin the money
[1:55:42] trinimini10: they been fighting whole day LUL
[1:55:43] Moonsc: not good
[1:55:50] Celascion: @mortuusintus12 The thing is, CG is selling a massive load of what they robbed to them. It's a mutually beneficial relationship
[1:55:57] vcripps: GET in to conflict and see how her money runs go on
[1:55:59] shanejo127: I don't understand ming, fanny, dhead, and everyone in the group chill with cg.
[1:56:27] shanejo127: Tuggz
[1:56:32] x_e__r_x: And this group having a gun and big dicking everyone in this stage of the city gives them a delusion
[1:56:48] ajnonohdat: @x_e__r_x Gun is power
[1:56:55] Canahealz: the city is different
[1:57:05] mortuusintus12: @Celascion at this moment. and its the same for the weed sellers. they get the rep and the sellers get the money.  4heads point is theyre doing all the work for the turf. and theres nothing stopping them from joining other turf and get the same thing
[1:57:19] JackLDN27: Fanny gunna kick 4head out the house at this rate PEPW
[1:57:31] Grachmann: I, the viewer, hold the power :)
[1:57:39] ragorez: @mortuusintus12 will another group accept them? and if they do will they give better benefits?
[1:57:39] trinimini10: nothing being established, causing power vacuums
[1:57:44] ajnonohdat: @Grachmann SeemsGood
[1:57:53] Celascion: @mortuusintus12 except they join other turf, they lose the rep. And no other turf is picking up randoms like that. There's only so much space in everyone's app
[1:57:56] darkmiepje: only thing i wanna see is reopening the burger by the oshean
[1:58:18] shanejo127: Dickhead is for sure chill with CG I don't understand
[1:58:59] ragorez: is 4head asking for just yaegar to not be robbed or his whole crew?
[1:59:03] mortuusintus12: @ragorez there are like 30 turfs, and most group like weed slingers so they wont do it themselves. if the besties lose their weed sellers. 4head , ming and lovemore wont sling themselves and its pretty much the end of the turf unless they find someone else and lose them again
[1:59:14] trinimini10: @ragorez whole crew
[1:59:54] spoonfullofMusic: chodie, peanut?
[2:00:02] spoonfullofMusic: novah
[2:00:13] shanejo127: True
[2:00:14] Grachmann: Winning RP Pog
[2:00:17] ragorez: also if yaegar is in paleto and cg is right next to you, who u gonna ally with
[2:00:31] x_e__r_x: Guns = Rp win in 4 month from now when everyone will have guns?
[2:00:35] mortuusintus12: @Celascion taking in a random weed slinger and theres no negative on that. any group can take in a weed seller for free. why wouldnt other group take free rep
[2:00:42] svan223: Ming wanna rob yager for 20k when 4head gets free mags worth 200k
[2:00:45] svan223: so it makes no sense
[2:00:58] mortuusintus12: @svan223 thecaraPlus1
[2:01:26] 5800x3d: I think Ming just wants 4head to strong arm his sellers a lil
[2:01:49] rayantrex: CG hydra yeager who else no one straight up
[2:02:02] ragorez: this is interesting, been watching moonmoon and government politics and this is like street politics
[2:02:04] trinimini10: it is basically everyone in the EU timezone
[2:02:08] x_e__r_x: I think 4head just thinking in the long term.
[2:02:09] mortuusintus12: 4head just want kris, and maynard to have some incentive to be loyal to them.
[2:02:10] md783: Yh 4head has gone soft
[2:02:20] TropicalToucan: OMEGALUL
[2:02:27] randjjjj: solid point is 4head does want to fuck over his own people, easy it is
[2:02:30] MadChemistTHC: 4head just doesn't like ming not  respecting he's boys with yeager
[2:02:40] randjjjj: does not"
[2:02:46] spoonfullofMusic: 4head yealous of fanny is what i see KEKW
[2:02:49] shanejo127: When does the besties work with yaeger?
[2:02:49] TropicalToucan: Wasnt future joining the expansion pack LUL and ming wanted to rob him?
[2:03:03] neferipit0: both sides has valid points
[2:03:12] trinimini10: @TropicalToucan it is more robbing anyone that doesnt go through them
[2:03:17] Grachmann: AND LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING
[2:03:20] Grachmann: "Answers Phone"
[2:03:36] mortuusintus12: @TropicalToucan hes willing to rob him if he runs it on his own hahaha
[2:03:40] keikobeans: 4head got a valid point, buuut if everyone got 1-3 people they wont rob in the end its gonna be the whole city LUL
[2:03:46] shanejo127: Exactly it's 3.0 shit and that shit can be convoluted
[2:04:01] mortuusintus12: whats funny is fanny is also taking cut for washing the money from the laundry too hahaha
[2:04:22] loadingl_: LUL
[2:04:43] randjjjj: those 3 mags are like hella money KEKW
[2:04:44] trinimini10: oh okay now that is bad lol
[2:05:01] x_e__r_x: 3 mags are like 250 bc
[2:05:09] trinimini10: he is doing what they got mad at hazel for lol
[2:05:13] svan223: ming dont understand that
[2:05:17] mortuusintus12: cleaning the 400k and no commision. THE MAGS ARE THE COMMISSION hahaha
[2:05:19] thajollypirate: so 4head is stealing the business  NODDERS
[2:05:22] hasanoo5: he never mentioned that to ming
[2:05:37] TropicalToucan: The group is making "tax" on him though why would you rob someone you also taxc
[2:05:43] TropicalToucan: the mags
[2:05:45] mortuusintus12: MAGS are crazy  expensive. 50 butts plus mats each haha
[2:05:54] shanejo127: Did ming know this?
[2:06:01] x_e__r_x: Yeah i do remember the Weed tax PepeLa
[2:06:06] hasanoo5: loool
[2:06:08] TropicalToucan: OMEGALUL
