[1:11:57] Kthanid: But yeah, everyone else hatesit.
[1:11:58] laxwall11: Yup
[1:11:59] LilMaGooby: The council didn't feel comfortable voting on it, so it passed with next to no votes
[1:12:20] kangg: Hmmge
[1:12:21] Siirika: Everyone basically abstained instead of saying no so it passed yeah
[1:12:26] Pleasantmsp: Damn, he didn't so now we all have to suffer katesSuffer (joke)
[1:12:27] Kthanid: Sometimes you just handwave stuff like that.
[1:12:29] lorddracnor: Crane's ooc message to Moon was "stop trying to legislate your rp checks, you old bitch"
[1:12:30] doc_sharon: I haven't heard really any support of it katesShrug
[1:12:32] fattydelrey: they should really just state "your going up for 20" and just not give times/days/mins
[1:12:32] Denetti_: the arguement for the reason is that it prevents 30 year olf characters that have served 20 years in prisonm like LIzzie
[1:12:35] zonerover: Only no was Canter
[1:12:50] Denetti_: *30 year-old
[1:13:04] RubyBlade_: everyone abstained bc they were certain that the "feds" would strike it down if it did pass lol
[1:13:11] doc_sharon: lined up for weed already!
[1:13:13] Nightbot: Follow Kate on Instagram! instagram.com/kate.ttv
[1:13:30] laxwall11: You are right
[1:13:30] if0rg0t2remember: most folks abstained it seems
[1:13:32] Kthanid: Honestly I hope it gets reverted.
[1:13:44] zonerover: I saw that section and the no came from Canter (Molly)
[1:13:47] Siirika: Malton
[1:13:48] Pleasantmsp: Either way is gonna break immersion. I just think going to jail for minutes in order to keep people the same age is not worth it
[1:13:50] KarnEvil: molly posted in her discord canter voted no.  the image I saw floating around had her as an abstain tho.

[1:13:59] RubyBlade_: everyone that abstained would have been a no if they thought that the feds wouldn't stop it
[1:14:12] RubyBlade_: I think
[1:14:23] laxwall11: The official record is that Cantor abstained
[1:14:26] Pleasantmsp: katesSuffer
[1:14:28] Gerard_NZ: #NotMyMayor [joking tone]
[1:14:35] A_Humble_Wooper: If there's only one no, it only takes two yes votes to pass a thing.
[1:14:38] rickbuh: they all expect the "federal government" to rule I think
[1:14:40] zonerover: I guess is that people want to express their opinion they need to actually vote
[1:14:47] Ms_LadyMix: passing the buck upstream is a classic voting tactic that usually goes poorly lol
[1:14:51] if0rg0t2remember: I think the reasoning most people took to abstain is that neither is realistic.
[1:14:59] lightstormclaw: what was passed?
[1:15:03] Pleasantmsp: All the next mayor candidates have to do is say they'll change that shit back and I'd vote for them
[1:15:09] doc_sharon: I just want to say, I do not miss being in city politics AT ALL KEKW
[1:15:23] if0rg0t2remember: saying Months feels better than Minutes, but serving 20 minutes and calling it Months also is odd
[1:15:24] zonerover: The healthcare in the city has always been miraculous KEKW
[1:15:25] lorddracnor: suspension of disbelief, everyone is an actor
[1:15:26] KarnEvil: yeah, the next mayor/council could just overturn it.
[1:15:29] laxwall11: They didn't have the balls to vote no and wanted the admins to veto it but they didn't and now they are stuck unless they pass a new law
[1:15:31] Siirika: Yeah none of them ''work'' but everyone is just used to months/days at this point so katesShrug
[1:15:35] A_Humble_Wooper: Or get run over by a car and walk out of the hospital ten minutes later without even crutches.

[1:59:11] doc_sharon: KEKW
[1:59:14] if0rg0t2remember: that means you have wifi and no tea withdrawal

[1:59:15] Pleasantmsp: KEKW
[1:59:17] itsjustasummerjob: YES
[1:59:20] Kthanid: She's dedicated.

[2:00:13] tachyondecay: Never been on a flight with WiFi, wow
[2:00:32] Kthanid: If your commercial electronics in a multi-million dollar plane are affected by wi-fi signals...you have a larger problem.
[2:00:50] itsjustasummerjob: I was shocked because my last flight didn’t have Wi-Fi and it was 5.5 hours
[2:00:51] Marsbar305: No Zack Moeris brick celphones on the plane katesRaid katesRaid
[2:00:58] doc_sharon: old old old school cellphone had microwave transmitters
[2:01:12] abblepiewit: IME most flights except the really small planes have wi-fi for purchase now
[2:01:18] if0rg0t2remember: the reason they want you to turn the cellular modem itself off is because it messes with sites on the ground if you are close enough
[2:01:28] itsjustasummerjob: NO
[2:01:30] willowfennec: it has to do with interfering with the navigation systems in the plane because they use similar frequencies but that's not generally the case anymore
[2:01:39] doc_sharon: that suuuuuuucks
[2:01:43] doc_sharon: NOOO

[2:02:14] Insaif: AFTER I had paid for it.,
[2:02:21] doc_sharon: DAMN
[2:02:23] Kthanid: Quick internet research, it's not even bluetooth and wifi they're worried about.  But the radio transmitters in  phones and other devices.
[2:02:25] doc_sharon: they were thoomin
[2:02:28] if0rg0t2remember: I've never been on a flight where the wifi works properly
[2:02:29] shad1332: that's why I bring my switch everywhere
[2:02:57] if0rg0t2remember: the 2 few times we've had wifi and I've either paid or gotten it for free with my ticket, it was so slow and broken I asked for a refund

[2:32:44] laxwall11: TY
[2:33:10] IchibaToll: That sounds about right.
[2:33:22] GenuineMind: Summer telling people to keep secrets in character? Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaa?
[2:33:29] NoharTheShark: if that's the case then he shouldn't be hinting at stuff...that seems like just as much a break in lane's trust as just coming out with it
[2:33:29] Nightbot: Follow Kate on Instagram! instagram.com/kate.ttv
[2:33:35] Kthanid: And these are the instances where you don't listen to your friend and trust your own moral judgement.
[2:33:49] doc_sharon: Maxx has jumped to help Bev when he needs it NODDERS
[2:34:08] Crafty_Crystal: why is he even talking about club rules let alone someone breaking them? Has he seen them?
[2:34:09] itsjustasummerjob: @kthanid I totally disagree. I think he should just say he was asked not to say anything and that telling would be a break in Lane’s trust.
[2:34:30] Pleasantmsp: @itsjustasummerjob I agree
[2:35:07] lorddracnor: yup
[2:35:07] fattydelrey: he already broke trust by mentioning medication anyways
[2:35:23] Crafty_Crystal: dropping hints and then lying is oof
[2:35:26] Symbiotic1: people never just say "i was told not to say." but yeah he spilled a bit to stirr
[2:35:29] lorddracnor: frigg off Randy!
[2:35:34] doc_sharon: katesPat
[2:35:45] Kthanid: I can definitely see both sides as viable options, but for me, I'd rather take the potential hit if makes sure the person I care about is safe and cared for.

[2:36:54] doc_sharon: and put a shirt on, Randy katesMadge
[2:37:02] SetraLynn: Me personally, I'm with you Kthanid, but I can also see Lane being the kind of person who would cut Bev off for breaking that trust and I think he'd know that. katesPlot katesBlubbers
[2:37:30] Kthanid: Yeah.
[2:37:42] itsjustasummerjob: We all know how Lane’s trust works. Bev being scared is so valid XD

[2:38:30] DirectorStephanie: katesYell
[2:38:32] ScutiFruti: Wait, why would a leader of a mc clup tell secrets like that to someone working for the company?
[2:38:37] if0rg0t2remember: would Maxx stop digging if he said "I was given Lane's trust and told not to tell anyone" ?
[2:38:40] doc_sharon: ppJedi GokuGriddy AlienPls
[2:39:01] ScutiFruti: ah right sry

[2:39:25] doc_sharon: spicy locals today Yesyes
[2:39:51] Kthanid: He's being very Bev about it.
[2:39:55] SetraLynn: Like, Lane wanted Bev to be her old lady. She holds him in a similar respect as done club members.
[2:40:17] SetraLynn: Bev "I've never broken a rule" Brekkers.
[2:40:24] itsjustasummerjob: Lane is more than entitled to tell her personal secrets to whoever she wants XD

[2:43:20] itsjustasummerjob: Lane opening up to the club right before she left about her mental state was I think, the biggest moment of trust she’s shown in her club members. I don’t know that people know how serious that was (I suspect Maxx & Wade do, obvs)

[2:44:22] doc_sharon: that makes so much sense NODDERS
[2:44:44] Nightbot: Follow Kate on Instagram! instagram.com/kate.ttv
[2:44:54] itsjustasummerjob: Yeah Lane was unwillingly medicated in her teens which is why she’s so against therapy / meds
[2:45:04] doc_sharon: thank you for letting us know that part of Maxx's lore katesL
[2:45:18] itsjustasummerjob: Fucking sucks for Maxx :(
[2:45:22] doc_sharon: gotcha Yesyes
[2:45:57] doc_sharon: helps us know her motivations Yesyes
[2:46:12] VTMonster: Poor little murder been
[2:46:14] doc_sharon: oop
[2:46:33] Insaif: Hmmge
[2:46:34] doc_sharon: katesPlot Ok then
[2:46:35] KarnEvil: oop
[2:46:45] fattydelrey: accidentally to 2 people??
[2:46:46] Larkonus: OOOP
[2:46:52] NoharTheShark: how do you "accidentally" let slip the same info to two different people?
[2:46:54] laxwall11: I mean once is a slip but twice is a lot
[2:47:23] itsjustasummerjob: I had a dip in service what happened??
[2:47:49] Kthanid: I mean don't forget Bev is VERY anxious person, him slipping over his words makes sense.
[2:48:36] itsjustasummerjob: Does Maxx know exactly what Bev means when he talks about the rule? Like, I know OOC you know, but does Maxx?
[2:48:43] doc_sharon: katesPlot
[2:48:44] itsjustasummerjob: I know she’s been pretty oblivious to Tom’s feels
[2:49:29] itsjustasummerjob: God I love Maxx so much
[2:49:33] itsjustasummerjob: What a fun character
[2:49:47] doc_sharon: welp KEKW
[2:49:51] doc_sharon: there you go KEKW
[2:49:52] frsttyyy: oop
[2:49:52] itsjustasummerjob: OOP
[2:49:54] Insaif: KEKW
[2:49:54] fattydelrey: huhhh
[2:49:56] Marsbar305: Ooof
[2:49:58] Kthanid: oop
[2:50:10] MyNameisTiff_: One of the things I find most interesting about conversations with Maxx is that when she says "I don't know how to feel" it's a declarative statement. And most people don't realize she means not just in the current situation, but overall.
[2:50:11] doc_sharon: Bev is just vomiting info over here KEKW
[2:50:11] Insaif: And Maxx is just like katesHUH
[2:50:22] if0rg0t2remember: oooh he said more about the thing I didn't think he'd say something about
[2:50:22] itsjustasummerjob: LOL
[2:50:22] Marsbar305: feliciaCreeperani feliciaCreeperani
[2:50:26] lorddracnor: katesGiggle
[2:50:28] fattydelrey: so is maxx still oblivious even though she's been told by people about toms feels?
[2:50:48] AshuraX13: katesHi Hullo Kate and Chat! katesL Sounds like I got back at a spicy moment. How has today been going?
[2:50:55] doc_sharon: katesSteer
[2:50:55] itsjustasummerjob: I don’t know that Tom’s feelings have been seriously confirmed
[2:50:55] IchibaToll: Nice of Bev to make that decision for Maxx and Tom.
[2:51:03] doc_sharon: hi @AshuraX13
[2:51:06] itsjustasummerjob: Like, people can joke about crushes
[2:51:13] Insaif: @AshuraX13 katesWave It's going good, with a hint of spice. katesJuice
[2:51:29] itsjustasummerjob: PLAYING dumb is a good way to dissuade people from actually catching feelings too
[2:51:43] doc_sharon: Yeah, seeing how Rue jokes with the boys, it makes sense to see the crush stuff as a joke
[2:51:46] Marsbar305: Woah
[2:51:51] Marsbar305: katesSuffer
[2:51:56] whatthebus: katesBlubbers
[2:52:16] VTMonster: Maxx has LOADS of trauma
[2:52:19] Marsbar305: Yeah...
[2:52:32] VTMonster: What even are feelings anyway?
[2:52:32] doc_sharon: that makes sense NODDERS
[2:52:36] Marsbar305: That was yucky
[2:52:36] laxwall11: And now Bev too
[2:52:49] laxwall11: Never
[2:52:53] doc_sharon: EVER
[2:52:55] Marsbar305: Nope
[2:52:55] Crafty_Crystal: actually a wild assumption when nobody has even talked to Maxx
[2:52:56] itsjustasummerjob: Literally never
[2:53:02] VTMonster: No, I mean what are feelings/emotions. Emotions aren't real, are they?
[2:53:02] AshuraX13: Everyone is assuming Maxx is emotionally well adjusted. No one realizes how messed up she is
[2:53:06] laxwall11: Not even did something nice for him
[2:53:13] doc_sharon: People are creating their own reality NODDERS
[2:53:14] Nightbot: Follow Kate on Instagram! instagram.com/kate.ttv
[2:53:16] if0rg0t2remember: the most she has said is that the valentine was nice
[2:53:16] itsjustasummerjob: Everyone is so wrapped up in how Tom feels they kinda assume Maxx must feel similarly
[2:53:22] lorddracnor: group effort for a one sided relationship
[2:53:22] Insaif: ^
[2:53:22] Nightbot: ^
[2:53:28] itsjustasummerjob: Cause they like… get along? I guess??
[2:53:32] AshuraX13: Yeah no one thinks about Maxx
[2:53:34] Marsbar305: LUL LUL
[2:53:37] Insaif: Tom talks to everyone...except Maxx.
[2:53:40] laxwall11: Which also has to piss off Maxx
[2:53:45] Crafty_Crystal: everyone but Maxx
[2:53:55] Hoocairz: Well, if a guy says he likes a girl then the girl likes the guy obviously cuz yknow, gender roles.
[2:53:56] itsjustasummerjob: It’s c a r a z y
[2:54:10] doc_sharon: And when Maxx says "I don't do feelings" people don't believe her katesMadge
[2:54:26] Marsbar305: Tom yaps too much katesFight
[2:54:36] AshuraX13: Yo!
[2:54:38] itsjustasummerjob: He also brought it up like… in a childish way? Like “ooo Maxx look the moon” like she’s a toddler XD
[2:54:47] its_me_andie: I appreciate all the insight into how Maxx is thinking
[2:54:52] Marsbar305: katesEyes
[2:54:57] lorddracnor: valentines are historically known to cure lifelong trauma/j
[2:55:11] laxwall11: Yeah I was just going to say that
[2:55:19] Marsbar305: This spice is delicious
[2:55:20] doc_sharon: that will make her even more protected with her info? katesHm
[2:55:21] itsjustasummerjob: When he said that I was like… what the hell
[2:55:23] laxwall11: She shared and someone took it
[2:55:26] KarnEvil: katesSip
[2:55:35] doc_sharon: i get it NODDERS
[2:55:44] Insaif: katesYEP
[2:55:45] AshuraX13: No one has asked either
[2:55:54] itsjustasummerjob: To be fair she was probably at the most emotionally vulnerable that we’ve seen her that night?
[2:56:01] itsjustasummerjob: And drinking
[2:56:11] Insaif: Oh, 100%, Summer
[2:56:17] doc_sharon: being in a command position makes it easier to keep people at arms length, too Yesyes
[2:56:22] laxwall11: Yeah makes sense
[2:56:53] laxwall11: Oh you are just going to make up stuff about me. Cool I am not sharing any personal information
[2:57:03] tiffwinterblue: when you say Maxx has no feelings, is that everything? no excitement, no happiness, no confidence, no caring, no emotional anything? or is it specific?
[2:57:23] itsjustasummerjob: Wade doesn’t pry because he minds his own fucking business. Lane doesn’t pry unless it’s super silly or club relevant.
[2:57:28] AshuraX13: Maxx is also extremely guarded
[2:57:43] doc_sharon: She gets enjoyment out of stuff, like crime, though Yesyes
[2:57:46] VTMonster: C'mon Rue, bring up the vibes - Maxx yesterday
[2:57:51] lorddracnor: She's the one with a broom going "there there"
[2:58:04] laxwall11: Too everyone in the club
[2:58:04] Kthanid: Doesn't know how to express/articulate the feelings?
[2:58:07] itsjustasummerjob: Tom is written as a character to be the most “prying” about the people around him (not said negatively)
[2:58:08] doc_sharon: we got this,Wade Hypee
[2:58:09] laxwall11: Many many times
[2:58:25] laxwall11: But no one listens outside of Wade and Laney
[2:58:28] rickbuh: she recognizes emotions, but doesn't know how return or empathize them
[2:59:33] itsjustasummerjob: Rue is so OFF right now
[2:59:33] laxwall11: Maxx is more like cool that is happening what should be done about it. Give me a solution if you bring up a problem
[2:59:40] itsjustasummerjob: Lying to Sandy is wild
[2:59:57] AshuraX13: Character trait question, Maxx also doesn't like being lied to, correct?
[3:00:20] doc_sharon: chickens live here katesAw
[3:00:20] deathfrombelow7707: Loud and proud about being in an MC. Until it's inconvenient
[3:00:41] AshuraX13: Just something Maxx would never do
[3:00:49] doc_sharon: we got this katesCheer
[3:01:10] laxwall11: Maxx was super excited to find that moonshine yesterday
[3:01:17] AshuraX13: MaxxFire
[3:01:21] lorddracnor: trauma victim, not sociopath
[3:01:21] doc_sharon: MaxxFire
[3:01:24] Insaif: MaxxFire
[3:01:27] KarnEvil: MaxxFire
[3:01:33] laxwall11: So why would you sign up for that again lol
[3:01:39] AshuraX13: And that doesn't change quickly
[3:03:07] AshuraX13: Everybody
[3:03:09] itsjustasummerjob: I know Lane isn’t in town, but I also really dislike Tom yapping to everyone but command
[3:03:10] doc_sharon: Yesyes
[3:03:10] abblepiewit: I think Maxx could connect the dots on that - don't know if she knows it outright? But, yeah, there's enough things been said about it.
[3:03:17] Nightbot: Follow Kate on Instagram! instagram.com/kate.ttv
[3:03:18] itsjustasummerjob: Feeeeeels … shady
[3:03:40] itsjustasummerjob: Like he wants validation from the club that it’s okay but knows he wouldn’t get that from Wade or Lane
[3:03:51] doc_sharon: katesLuck for yob
[3:03:57] AshuraX13: Oh Maxx added numbers to her contacts?
[3:04:12] AshuraX13: So much easier
[3:04:17] Crafty_Crystal: wouldn’t she have to think it wasn’t just a joke to care about that? she told everyone about Bev’s valentine
[3:04:21] kangg: katesLuck for yob and chase
[3:04:35] AshuraX13: I liked when Eve did it in 3.0 too
[3:04:49] doc_sharon: I'm still geeking out on how fucking cool that money run was yesterday katesHypers

[3:18:16] NoharTheShark: every time i hear strike points i think of lucky strike points
[3:18:19] AshuraX13: katesWicked
[3:18:27] Crafty_Crystal: Does she think Tom likes her now or that they could be making the same assumptions about Tom?
[3:18:38] laxwall11: Worse tom has done is talk to people in the club which isnt really a rule break.
[3:19:10] VTMonster: She likes Tom like she likes club members she gets along with
[3:19:13] Kthanid: Yeah all Tom is guilty of is having feelings for someone.

[3:20:56] FantaSciFile_Keiannah: I just had asada fries(beef)
[3:20:56] Insaif: My wife goes through that a lot. She asks that we get steak at least once every couple of weeks.
[3:21:01] Crafty_Crystal: Confront him on if he actually does have feelings? not that he did something wrong
[3:21:12] nerdy416: just go to the keg and call it a day
[3:21:16] FunkFoo: @FantaSciFile_Keiannah One of the best ways!!
[3:21:19] KarnEvil: I mean, the club is filled with top tier stirrers.  I'm surprised there isn't more stirring tbh.
[3:21:51] AshuraX13: Steak? Delicious. Steak someone else makes? Extra delicious
[3:21:55] doc_sharon: the timing on a steak going from delicious to meh is small katesPlot hard to get good delivery steak
[3:22:00] nohlium: I don't like cooking raw meat so I don't usually eat meat unless it is prepared by someone else
[3:22:02] UppyFF: steak so expensive to buy and then if you overcook it feels like a waste. less risk to eat it at a restaurant etc

[5:59:03] Nightbot: Loaf It or List It is a segment where we look at unique house listings submitted from viewers like you! (Check out !submit if you want to contribute to the segment.) It's inspired from a show called "Love It or List It", where people have their house renovated for a week, while they tour new houses. The homeowners decide whether they love their renovated space enough to stay OR to list the house for one of the houses they toured. Our segment is a play on words of the show and Kate's cat, Loaf.
