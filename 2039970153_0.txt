[0:25:26] ryochan_nel: god damn
[0:25:40] theace8869: don’t buy helium   balloons it’s a finite resource and we’re using it for balloons
[0:25:54] iamdingus876: ^
[0:25:59] swoleMaz: "In 2019, David Cole-Hamilton, emeritus professor of chemistry at the University of St Andrews, told the Independent that he estimated that the world had around 10 years left of helium unless more effort was put into recycling. Others suggest between 100 and 200 years of helium usage could be a best estimate."
[0:26:00] PhantasmOpera: I got the drop. Nice

[0:27:28] swoleMaz: lol
[0:27:36] PhantasmOpera: Yeah it isn't renewable. It's used mostly in MRI machines to keep the magnets cold
[0:27:53] Twist3d81: with that being said you should definitely try some helium beer
[0:27:53] AncientGamer967: The sword lets you survive in ring without syringes or medkits

[0:42:06] bunniesnpai: I told him that he more than likely is pathera
