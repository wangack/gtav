[3:32:46] BozzyGG: I love this
[3:32:56] lucho724_: he’s basically asking PD to prove the kidnapping
[3:33:06] JetpackDuck: So it would be the criminal vs civ word right?
[3:33:08] WTFimnothere: The problem is there really isn't a way to collect evidence regarding kidnapping right? So it'll always just be he says she says
[3:33:11] This_Is_Rocco: it would be fair if the victim had a personal relationship with the suspect and had a reason to be malicious. other than that they have no real reason to lie but the suspect does
[3:33:23] JakeB27: wouldnt it be unlawful imprisonment if they took him as hostage from the laundry and didn’t let him leave . Is that still a violent felony
[3:33:35] BozzyGG: @jetpackduck its a he said she said. So no
[3:33:54] KingGoddeth: mmmmm case law. i do love me some legal precedence
[3:34:27] VerityNS: I would think that the civ is believed to have no reason for lying inherently but a crim is often seen to "gain" something from lying or denying they did something?
[3:34:29] snake3y3ss: @jakeb27 it’s still a violent felony but one gives much less time and fine
[3:34:51] GoodNewsforyoo: by the way
[3:34:56] GoodNewsforyoo: I have good news with me that I wanted to share HolidayPresent who wants to hear it ':p
