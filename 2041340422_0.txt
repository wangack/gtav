[1:50:03] Foxxera_tv: 10%

[1:50:13] fanste12: From what? I just joined
[1:50:13] CoconutCow2: yeah thinking 15-20%
[1:50:13] AKOUTY: 15%
[1:50:14] karverro: 20% sounds right
[1:50:16] hippiehs: 30% now less when you get more rep
[1:50:16] KentKLS: 5%
[1:50:18] dstopian: i would say since u have low rep for now 50% cut
[1:50:18] MadTape6: 20% would be fair
[1:50:18] qualia07: 40 bc low rep
[1:50:19] daniel2keer: think u get 100 % since there is risk
[1:50:20] tcobym: who? the npc?
[1:50:21] leakybum_999: no meta honestly think he’s gunna take at least 10% @sayeedblack

[1:50:22] Sl33pyJinn: 15 like the taxes
[1:50:23] ShreddedFPS: i dont think any cut, cause you do all the work right? i say 0%
[1:50:28] eurie14ph: 69
[1:50:28] Bobofett: If it's 20 that's still kind of rough
[1:50:29] derpysmurf123: 30% low rep -> 10% high rep
[1:50:30] daniel2keer: but there is rep so might be low at first
[1:50:32] glitchex: 100%
[1:50:32] OriginalGibsta: maybe he pays more for the bigger money orders?
[1:50:33] mottarro: 0%
[1:50:33] deX_LQ: Prob alot but if u do like 500$ at a time u get giga rep
[1:50:36] shyness_1: it will get better
[1:50:36] Kunzey78: 50% now rep gets you down to 3%
[1:50:45] SpiritEX: YEPLOUD  a wild guess of 17.8%
[1:50:50] derpysmurf123: 500 max
[1:50:52] coldeveryday: lower percentage cuts as rep increases imo
[1:50:52] ShreddedFPS: 500
