I mean there will always be the usual chatters you know the ones but every day I'm watching the same streamers and on Reddit and DIscord thinking we're going in a circle saying the same old names but I love RP since mid 3.0 when Zerkaa joined NoPixel and Abdul picked him up from the airport and never looked back https://clips.twitch.tv/ScaryDeterminedIcecreamArgieB8-8U7wT_fc1GlU2NnC

[1:04:09] Jrd_: @MDM4ever1986HD If he wanted to make a comment on the drama, he would do so on his own, its just way too easy to clip people out of context and spread the drama

[3:58:01] SirGO0SE: I like that she has a gun but hasn't used it because she doesn't want to stop vigors rp with it
[3:59:03] Kyle_txt: Yeah his kid wwet the bet
[3:59:09] Witzz_: @Picklz Yeah he came into her chat saying his kid wet the bed and he wanted to make sure everything was okay with him so he got off
[3:59:11] Kyle_txt: and he had to go parent
[3:59:43] NealWilliam: LUL
[3:59:46] ViewbotReportingforDuty: Moon : hey yaeger, can you do me favour? Scare my wife will ya, thanks bud luv you
[4:00:14] pyke_hd: yeah all that "bullshit" ... right PepeLaugh
[4:00:21] pyke_hd: definitely wasn't treason
[4:00:24] pyke_hd: right
[4:00:33] Arkangel_I: Sure Kappa
[4:00:36] kily200: first sentence dawg
[4:00:38] goldenknight22: Hmm
[4:00:39] Blizzard5050: did you see the clip right after?
[4:00:44] viewlessd: you dont say things like that anyway
[4:00:50] kerndeezy: light treason Kappa
[4:00:51] Evezh_: she talked about it before the meeting tho
[4:01:00] goliathmaroof: can I roleplay as a Max fan and call it treason?
[4:01:20] Bruhbear: It's 'shall' not 'must', it's an example
[4:01:24] mrmangasm: it was super unprofessional to suggest it in front of the major, but its not treason
[4:01:24] Blizzard5050: shall is not must
[4:01:28] Insomonomics: Yeah I'm a Max fan but it was clearly a hypothetical question and not serious, albeit probably poorly stated and unprofessional
[4:01:32] walkgleesh: from your pov there is no way to know the things she actually  said
[4:01:44] ViewbotReportingforDuty: Brick literally had body double max before
[4:01:49] ben0809: @Christian2920 staree
[4:01:51] quimmers: with the right wording of pushing the charge it could
[4:01:58] Sahneee: @ben0809, fricc
[4:01:58] Christian2920: ben0809 kinamaSus
[4:02:01] Evezh_: its definitely not enough for a charge but a terrible thing to say to the mayor of all people KEKW
[4:02:04] ben0809: @Sahneee fricc
[4:02:08] kily200: ofc she would type the true words she said
[4:02:11] yellowradio91: I have investigated my self and I am not guilty lol
[4:02:13] Picklz: after the temputure of that conversation it would come across alot worse then hypothetical
[4:02:13] walkgleesh: they might have lied too
[4:02:35] SirGO0SE: Siobhan seemed very convinced and she was the longest serving female judge PrideShrug
[4:02:36] Froggopop: its crazy that cornwood joked about something far smaller and got repercussions
[4:02:42] Insomonomics: It makes for great spicy RP though
[4:02:43] quimmers: why is it deleted then?
[4:02:44] pyke_hd: motive? Not be fired for treason? Seems like a good enough reason for me
[4:02:46] 501warhead: I don't think anyone is intentionally lying. It's a clash of personalities and miscommunication
[4:02:46] BluGiant: @ben0809 SnuPoint uhsBlue uhsLove
[4:02:47] occams_cha1nsaw: PepeLaugh
[4:02:55] ryy89: motive to not get charged with treason Kapp
[4:02:57] olaf_gna: did she get a dap for it ?
[4:03:00] Sanivay: Its a werid state to be in it seems
[4:03:02] myrn9: Her statement was dap worthy but wasn't treason.
[4:03:06] walkgleesh: the motive would be not liking the oversight
[4:03:08] Dinguz: The clip was quite funny tbf, Moon went Feral LUL
[4:03:28] decipherment: this is very wishy washy from both sides
[4:03:31] kily200: thats still kinda messed up putting it out there
[4:03:31] SupaHsuB: Did Cornwood get the boot too?
[4:03:35] JoshGB_: I could be wrong, but it seemed max was pushing hard on it because if a normal officer said that they would be reprimanded for it
[4:03:37] BasedBruh: Ye the proposal they got is way different than the bill that was passed
[4:03:37] Xen_Crypt: no they removed it because it was treason Kappa
[4:03:39] Sablotron: calling for a vote isn't treason ffs.
[4:03:41] SupaHsuB: Ah ok
[4:03:41] ViilisRR: captains doing light treason

[6:16:59] hiicks_: "The handling is Great, Tops Speed is ass, Acceleration is mid, No, I do not have a turbo in it" This was Lt_Custards review of the bike
[6:17:08] Solidknight2112: For science uhsScience
[6:17:41] EmrysorMerlin: We need a cgi'd mustache off emote lol
[6:17:45] Sl33pyJinn: the mustache adds so much character its so good ngl
[6:17:47] MeguminGN: @uhSnow Try wheelie for acceleration?
[6:18:15] Xuezs: dont forget the seatbelt uhsDink
[6:18:19] bizzleschwizzle: Prime example....PD had to get a giga-car to keep up with Eugenes
[6:18:27] BfAleTitan: Have you heard Nikez ISO song?
[6:18:33] Andrewb1694: I want a bike too kinamaRip
[6:18:41] Sl33pyJinn: yeah it sounds just like how it looks
[6:18:44] hiicks_: Previously you couldn't upgrade the cars, you had the different modes that served that purpose but that came with it's own issues in regards to what could be used and when
[6:18:47] MartMonster: it kinda sounds like an MT-01
[6:19:58] MartMonster: I'm looking at a duke 390 wednesday
[6:20:18] BansheeShinigami: BansheeShinigami subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 46 months! 
[6:20:21] zap_rowsdower_42: I have an Indian FTR Rally
[6:20:22] hiicks_: The depth that Legacy has been able to code in is insane, Buddha wasn't lying when he said he was a crackhead for car dev stuff
[6:21:19] Rolling_Thunder197: I personally love me a Harley StreetGlide
[6:21:45] hpc_young: can we all agree the nicest looking duc is the 916
[6:21:57] wintersoldier2712: its 1mph faster
[6:22:01] Sl33pyJinn: a smaller one i think
[6:22:06] TaxxTime: the engine noise is great
[6:22:08] Osean13: lol more topend that 99
[6:22:10] Osean13: than
[6:22:18] Lupusdeus: what do the cruisers top out at?
[6:22:25] Ikilledkenny91: So is it meta to tell you someone did 1-2 hrs of turbo testing on the bike last night so you don't have to go thru it? (If this is kit's bike)
[6:22:27] Djepai: is the cornering impacted? that seems more important for chases
[6:22:27] Sl33pyJinn: NODDERS
[6:22:46] kerndeezy: even less reaction time for local swerves monkaW
[6:22:48] goldenknight22: BOOMIES
[6:22:48] smurfysylvia119: bike was actually brought by kit Archer already had turbo on it and says not to charge anything on the bike
[6:22:53] 1nfinitive: aren't all bikes relatively slow?
[6:22:58] Rolling_Thunder197: has anyone heard of the company called Rewaco?
[6:23:21] Sl33pyJinn: holy it's so agile KEKW
[6:23:30] xDinkleBot: WICKED
[6:23:44] Ikilledkenny91: @smurfysylvia119 ya kinda my thought but idk if that's meta'ing or not
[6:24:03] Rolling_Thunder197: I love the steady blues in the back
[6:24:04] the_fang: Did you get 99 turbo to it? how is it?
[6:24:11] Djepai: moon2HUH nice
[6:24:15] Osean13: ideally they put in another pike that would be used as the interceptor bike?
[6:24:17] BfAleTitan: brakes might be too good lol
[6:24:25] Halt57: goes from 80-0 way faster than 0-80 lol
[6:24:26] Daywalkerblade: It would easily keep up with everything but the crotch rocket ones
[6:24:27] Ikilledkenny91: If it was his bike I wouldn't say anything
[6:24:29] Sl33pyJinn: do you want us to meta it or do you want to know Hmm
[6:24:59] kerndeezy: peepoHappy
[6:25:08] xDinkleBot: FeelsBirthdayMan dupog
[6:25:11] Ikilledkenny91: Yes and its cornwoods turbo that was in there
[6:25:18] BasedBruh: There was no turbo in it
[6:25:19] Sl33pyJinn: one of the better bikes can go 120 mph
[6:25:24] Boylez: I mean can know now i guess
[6:25:28] Boylez: im curious anyway
[6:25:32] Ikilledkenny91: O she probably  took it out
[6:25:38] Ikilledkenny91: Cornwood gave her a turbo
[6:25:59] Newhampshires: havnet heard this song in years
[6:26:03] BfAleTitan: or it was stolen, silly turbo thieves
[6:26:19] MrSpiny: kivaHi
