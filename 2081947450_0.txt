[7:08:20] RenegadezMusix: Cheer100 Cheer100  Earlier today, Gavin was really horny, and he saw what he thought to be a blank DVD. He thought DVDs have a tight hole, so He put his soft pp into the hole of the DVD. A few seconds as he started getting harder, it  felt pretty good, but then, once he was fully erect, it started to hurt. His pp was stuck in the DVD, and he had to break it in half to get if out. It was then when he flipped the broken DVD over and realized that it was not a blank DVD, Kappa
