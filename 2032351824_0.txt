[6:25:11] minnmor: it could be that jenny should spend more time with V?
[6:25:16] nyx_constellation: V is also a new person

[6:26:06] MAZM0L: surr
[6:26:06] Bruvverbean: surr
[6:26:18] nyx_constellation: Could also be about the house, and since you are investing in the apartment is fine
[6:26:24] EternitysRaven: See this is why tarot readings are both cool and annoying. Because sometimes you hyper fixate on onepart and the overall message can be lost. Like saying not to put all your eggs in one basket, doesn't mean you ignore the basket all together
[6:26:31] wesfeye: diversified with nothoa already
[6:26:51] MAZM0L: @EternitysRaven facts
[6:27:00] minnmor: you arent putting them in one basket
[6:27:19] MAZM0L: tehnically you have 3 correct?
[6:27:40] Bruvverbean: basket could mean lots of things
[6:27:41] nikolegrnd: maybe a different kind of basket?
[6:27:44] wesfeye: get annoyed at the reading but still will come back next week classic

[6:28:21] minnmor: @0Laetitia0 ^
[6:28:23] nikolegrnd: food basket nikkisGiggle
[6:28:28] naturewise17: the fact you gave money for the nothoa house shows you don't put all your eggs in one basket
[6:28:39] MAZM0L: to hide them KEKW
[6:28:59] minnmor: and you have been making new friendships
[6:29:03] nikolegrnd: NODDERS true
[6:29:07] Bruvverbean: I don't know what you could link it with tbh KEKW
[6:29:11] GrumpyMark01: Don’t rely on Winston for advice
[6:29:50] MAZM0L: does your reading not count notHOA as new friends
[6:30:07] GrumpyMark01: I think Jenny is already following the advice the cards gave
[6:30:08] EternitysRaven: There is one basket you could maybe argue Jenny put all her eggs into, with the still waiting for Michael thing but that feels like a BIG stretch
[6:30:28] naturewise17: @EternitysRaven i thought this too
[6:30:47] TheOriginalNoobGamer: you are good nothing to worry about EZ
[6:31:37] filipe_vasconcellos_: NODDERS

[6:31:48] MAZM0L: @EternitysRaven good thought but nothing is happening with crime. so what else is to do.
[6:32:10] MAZM0L: other then chiling with reed and stabbing people for fun
[6:32:42] filipe_vasconcellos_: kareem said marble floor

[6:43:49] EternitysRaven: As it's not exactly been promoted
[6:43:50] wesfeye: love ppl randomly organizing debates
[6:44:02] Sssaap: and thus jenny took part in the debate instead. surely
[6:44:09] MAZM0L: you didn't even place that down is funny thing
[6:44:11] minnmor: no but who has been organizing it, cos its not fair to not contact everyone of the canditates then

[6:45:27] MAZM0L: i was looking at other building

[7:33:06] filipe_vasconcellos_: @wesfeye washing machine gonna have at the family house KEKW
[7:33:34] MAZM0L: @wesfeye you don't want to mix cloths what if v puts in wrong washing KEKW
