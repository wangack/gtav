[1:11:21] mystic_drewman: Build it like the old Lost compound
[1:11:28] Snow_Bow14: They take a lot of space though, but if someone opens a Repair shop and a Gas station there it would be cool

[1:37:48] recklessgallifreyan: occamPeep
[1:37:54] TPLivewire: Timmy is realizing Gemma is not as "normal" as he expected her to be. I think the thing that started his curiosity was when Gemma said in the truck one time, "What are the chances of two psychopaths being in the same car"
[1:38:00] SirBabelt: I mean Gemma clearly has some magic rizz on her. She can get caught driving 80 in the city and get off with a warning

[2:20:47] Orielne: Oh dear god
[2:21:02] SirBabelt: Well when you put it that way, then yes. The one thing cops hate the most, is people telling them what to do
