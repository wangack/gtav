[6:31:35] Goddlin: Only because homie took forever to shoot her lmao
[6:31:35] Crimian7: The dancing and emoting kinda gave it away

[6:31:45] Bulfwyne: NODDERS
[6:31:45] TieMyShoe22: i dont know what happened so i have no opinion on the matter :)
[6:31:45] Plinthos: What happened?? Walked away for 2 minutes to go work on some food in the kitchen. Did the delivery guy kill you over his truck? LUL
[6:31:46] ApathyEmbodied: monkaGIGA Dandy is investigating
[6:31:46] WTFimnothere: You were signalling right in front of her lol

[6:32:02] Seetherrr: @Onyxdevil even then, she was warned before that what she said was going to be an issue
[6:32:03] Pigs_on_the_Wing: and you warned her for what she did
[6:32:03] xxpops: if it was a high stakes delivery and he had back up i dont see that as rdm, if it was 3rd party then yes rdm

[6:32:09] vegaobscura: It's RDM because there was no actual rp, chat. No confrontation. No discussion.
[6:32:09] CurseYeeDinkleberg: The biggest thing is you talking to her, saying "Dont mess with me" and then giving a signal
[6:32:10] ParanoidAndroids: to be fair, this guy didn't have 2 minutes though and you were following for a while...
[6:32:10] Bradgor: You told her "This is going to put a target on your back"
[6:32:11] manbrasucks: @PENTA yeah and this guys circled the block 2 times.  That's basically the same thing. PEPW
[6:32:11] hench8: you even said you would do it way before
