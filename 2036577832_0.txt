[1:46:54] BadRabbits: internet is a grey area
[1:47:14] random_viewer_55: 110*
[1:47:18] sBuon: @random_viewer_55 100WPM is crazy
[1:47:27] random_viewer_55: 110 @sBuon
[1:47:40] BadRabbits: it's implied that websites on IRL internet exists, but you can't access them in game.

[1:47:48] BadRabbits: so it's not -1
[1:47:51] random_viewer_55: for these situations
[1:47:56] AlteredData: 100 is pretty average.
[1:48:16] sBuon: @AlteredData for the average person? the average person is 36 lol
[1:48:25] Lyoniscute: My mother has 150 wpm its terrifying
[1:48:34] random_viewer_55: it's not average. in most sites it's like 2-3 standard deviations above the mean.

[1:52:23] sBuon: @AlteredData tf a cluster?
[1:52:28] BadRabbits: so if you're transcribing you don't need to go much faster than that

[1:55:20] AlteredData: the muscle memory is nuts for that. I'm still having a hard time adjusting to a split.
[1:55:23] BadRabbits: before the keyboards there was no specific way of doing shorthand
[1:55:24] Tabah: My Grandmother was a stenographer for the Army in WW2, it's insane
[1:55:39] BadRabbits: so one stenographer couldn't read another's shorthand

[5:04:22] joel_alex: I just want to follow the story.
[5:04:29] Kiwo: i collect nothing but Ls
[5:04:30] PlethoraOfBees: @Kiwo I root against my streamer constantly DarthKermit
[5:04:30] B__M__C: I wonder how many of these events are organized distractions, the previous "kidnapping", the "apartment fire" yesterday... all seems very convienient
[5:04:30] r_kol: Who is the other male ginger cop?
[5:04:33] woolfdesign: My streamer? Take an L? The horror :(
[5:04:34] sBuon: Bro as long as Kiwo wins I'm happy, who cares about Custard Kappa
[5:04:36] Leritt: I mean i'm hopping often myself to just find out whats happening coz there is not much going on other streams
[5:04:44] VSDuck: @williamwildcat I was about to say I hop sometimes but I only watch and go back after I've seen what I want
[5:04:47] VSDuck: AAAA
[5:04:47] Nightbot: AAAA
[5:04:56] Lilliphus: we love lurker hoppers and nice hoppers ltcustLove i am also a chronic lurker hopper lol
[5:04:59] williamwildcat: @VSDuck same!
[5:05:00] r_kol: Who is the other male ginger cop? 󠀀
[5:05:01] g3ol0gi: but theres no L on Cornwood
[5:05:05] VSDuck: @sBuon Custard who modCheck
[5:05:22] Regzen: I'm glad Tips is a cop. He was always great in 3.0
[5:05:38] VSDuck: AAAA
[5:05:42] Lilliphus: fuckin love tipps
[5:05:43] r_kol: Tty
[5:05:45] Kiwo: Richard Tips is fantastic
[5:05:48] kaleidoskopeyes: AAAA
[5:05:48] Nightbot: AAAA
[5:06:05] captain_steve_420: hope to see more 3.0 cops come back
[5:06:31] Lilliphus: they prefer that people make new cops for 4,0
[5:06:43] captain_steve_420: to eachs own
[5:06:45] Kiwo: uh oh
[5:06:55] amber_bijoux: isn`t the person you are with an  old cop on a new character?
[5:06:57] Kiwo: i have my public cop does that count as new
[5:07:06] SimplyOrt: yeah i think of it like replaying a game cope on 3.0 possibly crim on 4.0 seems cool
[5:07:09] Kiwo: thank god
[5:07:12] SimplyOrt: cop**
[5:07:12] Kiwo: i like the new cops
[5:07:18] Kiwo: i really enjoy new cops/characters
[5:07:19] Lilliphus: yeah like old cop rpers but with new characters, custard played jerry sweets in 3.0
[5:07:31] Kiwo: but cos a lot of people are playing old characters IT'S HARD as a brand new character
[5:07:37] Regzen: I'd love new characters across the board for a wipe tbh
[5:07:43] williamwildcat: ye. and vice versa. crims got a lot of grudges
[5:07:53] sBuon: It's why I'm so excited for Criminal Jerry Sweets
[5:07:54] slymox: I think @MattRP is making a new cop as well. That was the reason for Ripley going clownmode.
[5:08:06] sBuon: sooooo much new ways to RP for Jerry
[5:08:07] Lilliphus: ew
[5:08:08] Asmodean01: don't want old baggage to be dragged up basically.
[5:08:24] captain_steve_420: fair
[5:08:25] SunAerah: Conan is still in coma
[5:08:31] Kiwo: there are no grudges with a new character but its hard to get involved with anything because everyone already has established groups
[5:08:53] melodymaeee: i love the fact it is more open to people who have never done cop RP before too. it's exciting for those who have always wanted to try
[5:08:56] Lilliphus: ive actually loved watching a lot of the old cop characters create new storylines since they weren't hired back- like ripley becoming a  clown is really cool
[5:09:05] melodymaeee: also hello kiwo my love
[5:09:09] Kiwo: melody <3
[5:09:17] sBuon: Crim Sweets hypeE
[5:09:28] straysinger_music: ngl I kinda wish new characters was an actual rule cause seeing people form mostly the same groups is kinda a bummer
[5:09:33] Kiwo: new cops are great but oh god cops seem down bad
[5:09:36] Regzen: Jerry Sweets starts his new MC. Already Diabetic MC wolfaM
[5:09:44] Kiwo: and constantly training
[5:09:49] Kiwo: LUL
[5:10:15] DiaBeetusKoby: YEP sign me up for another diabetic cult
[5:10:16] Lilliphus: yeah i was really hoping 4.0 would be a memory wipe for fresh stories but it be what it be
[5:10:52] g3ol0gi: union susge
[5:10:52] Kiwo: some folks keep referencing my other characters and hinting for me to bring them back which is always funny/awkward
[5:11:05] sBuon: @Kiwo would you say the RP landscape overall better than when you started?
[5:11:17] captain_steve_420: McNulty prowling
[5:11:34] Kiwo: @sBuon i mean, its always been the same - people are a lot more creative but people also rely a lot more on mechanics nowadays
[5:11:36] SunAerah: its hard to let go of a beloved char
[5:11:53] kaleidoskopeyes: goblin mode activated
[5:11:55] Kiwo: same stuff, different mechanics - is what it is but it's a good time
[5:12:04] Kiwo: stories just fizzle out
[5:12:06] sBuon: @Kiwo got it
[5:12:07] Kiwo: no point in forcing it
[5:12:09] g3ol0gi: union RP could be fun tho to see them fight for worker rights and go to strikes etc
[5:12:21] Asmodean01: Same with D&D characters, but making new stories is just as fun,
[5:12:28] Brentacus: is there anyone you havent got to or missed RPing with in 4.0?
[5:12:33] sBuon: Bringing back old characters is only worth it if there's something new for them to do
[5:12:37] LEAF_0013: this song sounds familiar, anyone know name pls?
[5:12:43] Kiwo: im never gonna get used to hearing someone else using 44 LUL
[5:12:43] melodymaeee: sometimes bringing characters back to give them a proper send off is nice, but oh boy are new characters freeing as fuck
[5:12:50] captain_steve_420: Imagine playing D&D in this game and thats all you do lol
[5:12:52] LEAF_0013: that's right tyvm
[5:13:10] sBuon: @Kiwo you can be 844 lol
[5:13:18] Lilliphus: i love the item exchange it looks so sus KEKW
[5:13:25] SimplyOrt: you miss it at first but at least for me the next character fills in that spot pretty quick
[5:13:49] Sync989: custyWAVE
