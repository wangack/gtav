[0:57:34] Kittriss: It's actually the opposite according to friends
[0:57:35] themanwithanrx7: you still have feeling
[0:57:44] Clairbear89: hmmm, since it is part of the body it is possible. Let me see if there are any papers on it
[0:58:02] The_Baker_Cam: my mother lost her breast from cancer and she has had itches that she cant scratch.
[0:58:44] Clairbear89: I mean it happens to women who have a mastectomy, and men who get this surgary. So it is possible
[0:58:45] The_Baker_Cam: Fokka Cancer Btw!
[0:58:47] SimplyOrt: hmmm let me just shuffle through the phantom cock n ball archive
[0:58:52] Clairbear89: WHAT THE HECK IS WITH THE HYDRAN?\
[0:58:56] Kittriss: My roommate had a partner that was mtf and she experienced pretty bad dysphoria but when she transitioned that phantom limb feeling was lost
[0:59:05] xMistressMayhem: Oof my hubby just did a dnd quiz pud style out of 40 he got 19 right
[0:59:22] showgirl_: update.. do not google phantom ball itch

[1:00:30] DiaBeetusKoby: KEKW
[1:00:37] SimplyOrt: only one way to find out, snip snip
[1:00:44] Bubbllerr: it can happen if the surgery goes wrong according to some studies
[1:00:45] Kittriss: I think you WANT it to be wrong KEKW
[1:00:48] Clairbear89: Around 60% of men who have had to have their penis amputated for cancer will experience a phantom penis.
[1:00:49] sBuon: I know too many trans people to know you're wrong AAAA but fuck it I guess
[1:00:53] WarpIRL: classic
[1:00:54] VariantIN: As a cis girl I sometimes feel like I have phantom dick
[1:01:03] Clairbear89: i have the link to the paper/research but it not the best :/
[1:01:15] WarpIRL: YEAH SCIENNCE
[1:01:24] DiaBeetusKoby: @Clairbear89 DO NOT POST IN CHAT
[1:01:25] DrunkenDanceMatBabby: I guess there's also the interplay of body dysphoria vs phantom limb
[1:01:27] Kittriss: I mean not to out myself but yeah it's not how it works KEKW
[1:01:59] FlameReetardantPanda: this is the kind of conversation I'd expect to walk into the middle of on a Boba stream

[1:03:05] showgirl_: ltcustLove
[1:03:07] sBuon: ez REFUND
[1:03:10] Clairbear89: @DrunkenDanceMatBabby that is what this link says too. those who change are going to a body they know/feel they have. but those who lose their genital unwillingly due to accidents or illness have a high chance of it.
[1:03:14] sBuon: * EZ refund
[1:03:14] VariantIN: "phantom dick" sounds like a 50 shades of grey spin off.

[1:03:20] FlameReetardantPanda: ltcustNOTES yes, so how do you feel about the chocolate
[1:03:30] VariantIN: in my mind it wears a little cape
[1:03:33] Kittriss: The dysphoria is kind of like phantom limb already so when you transition it's actually relieving

[4:35:22] bigmaan08: May i ask what the frustration is with the pD?
[4:35:41] slomojosh: when you were having the  officers focusing strictly on 911s and letting those evolve into something more it really changed the direction of morale
[4:35:48] bigmaan08: Gotcha, thanks. New to GTA RP
[4:35:48] slomojosh: cause yall absolutely killed it on Friday
