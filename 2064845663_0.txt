[1:10:25] Suvaacc: ac job is very good money, but only if you are skilled at it, biggest job is like 14 units * 300 bucks
[1:10:33] notwowayzz: @RecurveTV run takes an hour and 20
[1:10:54] LluagorED: @RecurveTV thats still too much. theres no risk. G6 dont even get that much and they are constantly getting robbed lol
[1:11:21] Suvaacc: also selling weed is even better now with buffed rates and that is like only crim job that you can do any time
[1:12:14] Suvaacc: i suggest to just make same contract with you crew as pigeon, let them pay upfront
[1:12:28] LluagorED: I like that they seperated growing and selling, but atm selling doesnt seem worth.
[1:12:31] Suvaacc: its seller problem if weed goes bad then
[1:12:34] LluagorED: growing I mean.
[1:13:02] El_Jefe_Lance: TwitchConHYPE TwitchConHYPE
[1:13:18] Suvaacc: and 4head is recruiting random goon to sell on your turf, who actually put in work unlike your crew
[1:14:52] LluagorED: @Suvaacc I think pigeon was right about having two HQ apps tho, one for sellers/growers, and another for your heist stuff.
[1:14:55] Suvaacc: the whole beef today was just about bad timing of multiple things that happened last week. in future bricks i imagine get sold pretty quick
[1:15:44] Suvaacc: @RecurveTV yeah i dont know, it has risk in sense that maybe some heist in future is tied to weed stuff
[1:15:51] frigginoasis: thats my line
[1:17:02] LluagorED: @RecurveTV yeh the whole app thing is just a bit confusing. And people being able to be on and own multiple just makes it more scuffed feeling.
[1:17:20] LluagorED: surprised they dont force you to only be a part of one group, and thats it.
[1:17:41] Suvaacc: yeah i feel like being on multiple hq apps was not intended, but maybe they are just going with it
[1:17:45] BlueIceMoon: @RecurveTV Sometimes its just an oversight
[1:17:56] LluagorED: @RecurveTV yeh i think thats exactly it.
[1:18:18] LluagorED: Yeh it keeps one group from owning everything.
[1:18:34] kannar_tv: NODDERS
[1:19:12] krepana: doesn't it also limit you to stay with one group
[1:19:34] KillScotty: LUL
[1:20:24] Heyitschevyy: pepeLaugh
[1:20:26] LluagorED: @krepana nah, you can be on multiple groups/apps
[1:20:55] LluagorED: @krepana Company has two, they just swap chips
[1:21:28] LluagorED: sorry, that might be meta.
[1:21:47] Suvaacc: @RecurveTV does that allow them to hit laundrymat twice?
[1:21:53] LluagorED: @RecurveTV yep!
[1:21:59] Suvaacc: seems busted
[1:22:10] BlueIceMoon: That's gonna become a problem in the future LUL
[1:22:10] LluagorED: a few groups have discussed doing multiple apps to keep hitting over and over.
[1:22:15] LluagorED: Yeh its definitely an oversight.
[1:22:24] Suvaacc: you could just set up 10hq app for your crw and spam laundrymat for money
[1:22:30] LluagorED: What I was saying earlier, kind of weird you can be on multiple.
[1:22:33] frigginoasis: sevret lovation
[1:22:45] LluagorED: @Suvaacc yeh the only limiting factor is butc.
[1:22:46] krepana: @RecurveTV yea i get that but i dont think they inted that
[1:22:59] frigginoasis: yea that to im to far from keyboard secret loxcation
[1:23:06] kannar_tv: modCheck cornwood
[1:23:32] BlueIceMoon: Cornwood gets distracted easily
[1:24:19] Suvaacc: the whole robbery system atm seems to be broken, with shared cooldowns, like most of the robberies reset on NA tsunami. You wake up at EU times and its all gone

[1:24:32] frigginoasis: OhMyDog GunRun MercyWing1 PopCorn MercyWing2

[1:25:40] Suvaacc: @RecurveTV yeah i'm not sure, full random is also not good for groups who wanna do it with crew but dont have prio always
[1:26:03] frigginoasis: yea wait
[1:26:19] LluagorED: @RecurveTV yeh I dont guess its really that big of a deal tbh. Theres only a couple groups speedrunning shit, and they are timegated too anyway.
[1:26:36] ThicccBrickBoi: draing gang
[1:27:14] LluagorED: I like the pace the Besties has so far. Theyre making progress but they arent just grinding nonstop for it.

[1:29:13] Pheyerus: *not until. just refused so he’d remember
[1:29:15] Suvaacc: 4head is allergic to making money which means his only grind is AC job atm
[1:29:17] LluagorED: @Suvaacc he fucks around but still gets stuff done. I like how he approaches playing a lot.
