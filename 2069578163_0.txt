[2:49:24] leon_krist: yuno not gonna wake up today?
[2:49:26] thyL: the idea is that one group of crims can't get involved if another group of crims and the cops are already involved both. they loosened it a bit in 3.0 for a little while and it became unbearably bad.
[2:49:27] BeeAkaBee: @BeeAkaBee exactly, i never thought i would enjoy gta rp until geega started
[2:49:28] OwlOfAvery: I love thinking about how there are other people on the server RPing with absolutely no connection to this situation. However, at some point the ripple effect of this will inevitably trickle down to them and change the course of their RP. Everything is connected.

[2:50:32] itzeln_: On laundry
[2:50:32] peepomi: maybe it applies before and after heists are completed if cops arent already involved
[2:50:34] thyL: but you could e.g. surprise assault a team going for ammunation crates *before* they get to the crates. i guess. shrujj
[2:50:34] docmabuut: That happened yesterday lol
[2:50:38] Reishid: I think they should update that rule given that you can start heist "remotely" now.
[2:50:39] UN1CR0N: yeah i thought it was once cops were involved w a scene you cant third party, but i think thats the more general rule, and the heist rule is a more specific thing
[2:50:41] ditheca: oh, there he is
[2:50:45] angrykitty47: Robbing people is aloud tho
[2:50:45] ImSurfinBird: I think it's a necessary rule that only gets enforced if it gets out of hand

[3:21:31] kalathys: this is good for Civ Gang. they lost 50 bc yesterday
[3:21:31] Chaaachy: tbh that rule was made cuz of x and cg. they were just camping people.
[3:21:32] Smokay17: I know there is two contracts that were bought at the same time, so if both are sniped at the same moment, that will lead to some weird interactions

[3:25:41] smileondear: he thinks he screwed the group and wants to make it right
[3:25:48] manjell0: robbing x wasn't the intention of shooting him though, he was just looking to take back what was rightfully his. Its a really weird situation how it bled to cg
