[1:17:23] CautiousDani: how he hates the songs he has to sing on stage now and the kids are like oohhh 😭😭
[1:18:01] opalducky: Same reason, it was so over played, everyone only wanted her to sing it and nothing else. You can actually see the progression of her slowly hating having to perform it
[1:18:05] Tyler4AM: I think Tyler the Creator has a lot of that too, there's songs at concerts that he refuses to perform despite his fans loving them
[1:19:02] Vizi797: In a similar way, I remember listening to an interview with David Draiman and him saying about the "oooh ah ah ah ah " at the beginning of Down with the Sickness being just something he did on a complete whim to and him saying somehow that's what's he's gonna be remembered for most out of all he's done kivaLUL
[1:19:21] StandardJake: there’s a compilation of the Panic at the disco singer getting annoyed about singing their #1 hit in concert
