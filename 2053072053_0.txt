[0:58:19] Myki_Cameda: Go to 150, 100/50.
[0:58:21] rmcgowan: Makes sense. The only people feeling that price pain are those coming in and repairing to full at 90%.

[1:08:52] jerabet: It's really easy to calculate and explain NODDERS
[1:08:53] Dinguz: Ems get reimbursed no?

[1:09:08] Thorsstar: EMS gets reimbursed nodd
[1:09:10] arcticOP: EMS said they didnt care about the pricing, they want mechanics to make money
[1:09:15] Isen_Mage: mechanics can just tell people "that'll be $800 in parts and $300 in labour"
[1:09:22] rmcgowan: And the EMS price isn't really going up. It only goes up if they are repairing at 90%
[1:09:40] Isen_Mage: YEP

[1:10:57] itaraa1043: @Sonaro8 mhm
[1:11:00] Isen_Mage: do the $90 part cost and $35 labour fee option. Then give the people selling parts for you $5-10 a part they sell. That will make him happy

[1:13:07] aluckynewb: can use that number on some mechanics and see what they think nodd
[1:13:13] atrollusername: about to get more money soon too peepoMoney
[1:13:17] Sonaro8: she could prob afford a washington on her own thing

[1:14:00] jerabet: @TheRealBatesu I think it was around 55k after tax at the time.
[1:14:00] ytu118: Mary barely makes the $10k a week not including parts
[1:14:02] Myki_Cameda: selling at 80$ to mechanics, and they charge 80$ +35$ labor?
[1:14:02] Matrix8369: @TheRealBatesu Alex is like the head clerk at the court house.
[1:14:08] klugklug: considering the grind, its really little
[1:14:12] Harcini: guys don't forget Mary had 260k in her account collected from a lot of people while JJ had 130k in his personal

[1:17:15] zenatr: Mosley's is the only shop that can repair on a consistent basis. Should 100% take advantage of that to leverage the prices
[1:17:22] Hobbitbot: 30 per %
[1:17:22] catlasskass: 12 hours for 7k, is that what you just said?

[1:17:55] arcticOP: @catlasskass she makes more money doing the repairs than selling the parts to her mechanics
[1:17:59] eborcurean: so mechanics make all their money on labour
[1:18:51] catlasskass: @catlasskass thats still insane, so much time spent making parts with very little RP involved. do they have to babysit the parts or can they que them up and leave?
[1:18:59] Dimonovi4: body engine 180?
[1:19:12] PsychoBKilla: Mosley's setting the standard

[6:52:23] eborcurean: people argue at 1k repairs a week while making 4k an hour
[6:52:29] CptApples: just buy mats from AU grinders
[6:52:32] Fiisky: @eborcurean Rusty is like 140 after tax or something like that for a master mechanic
[6:52:35] Vadoctrax: Or the state increases Rusty prices.
[6:52:39] footmunched: Also, if the 'City' knows that mats are 5 per, then people won't complain (much)
[6:52:40] RandomDCLXVI: i mean if it hits rusty prices they stop buying mats.
[6:53:15] eborcurean: @Doowie economy balancing is a hard skill. And needs one person doing it all with a plan. It's tough to do, major gaming companies struggle with it.

[6:54:14] itspacecowboy: The good thing is that materials can only go up so much before you don't buy materials, as you can make money off the NPC by buying the parts there. So there is a limit.
[6:55:18] ibruticus: Oh that's probably just a Vinny thing then
