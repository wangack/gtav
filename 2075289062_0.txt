[2:20:12] kami_7dragons: @bleepinbloopin high five lol
[2:20:17] MountainMAN1990: @riftshadow think that's a problem, not just that part of the group either unfortunately
[2:20:21] imatastypill: @faantix1 which would be key to also run a tier 2, the building has 3 doors unlike laundromat which is 2 doors

[2:23:43] T0pher_C: @TeemSmeek exactly
[2:23:54] elviz_u: @Ray__C wouldn't be better to do the heist farthest away from the house due to clashing with another group maybe? almost groups live in that area.
[2:23:56] dantikks: nodd

[3:31:10] ArGaM3r: i think the best way to organize the chairs is by placing the chair in the middle of the table and using pre-determined angled and equal local distance so they all line up.

[3:43:55] lertygamez: @ray__c take the white light out see how it looks
[3:44:05] insomniaglc: still hoping that he decides 4 2 reds
[3:44:18] RA1KAS: OTT waiting for the number Staring

[3:45:25] AboAlgber: surly there is no smaller table
[3:45:29] ghostkiller631: It's 5×5
[3:45:46] isaias_lion: Once you define one chair the other goes the opposite way.
[3:45:59] Zeust2000: a seat for each dongle color?
[3:46:09] Kai_Roback32: it’s a round table both sides are gonna be the same.
[3:46:11] insomniaglc: Its round it should be a 5 by 5
[3:46:13] isaias_lion: Than it's just a 45 angle
[3:46:27] h4des__20: Get all the chairs to be in 90 degrees to the adjacent chairs and boom problem solved
[3:46:29] kwarcinskia: how can it mathematically be 6x5
[3:46:32] kwarcinskia: lmfao
[3:46:34] kan_zeus: Use a temperory grid

[3:46:40] tillzl3y: 5 point star
[3:46:43] p__dragon: 6 seats, dongle colors Pog
[3:46:45] hellaslastchance: the easiest way is to put 0, 90, 180, -90 in the chairs and then move them accordingly
[3:46:46] insomniaglc: the middle off 3
[3:46:51] AboAlgber: @ghostkiller631 yep i counted the same
[3:46:54] uncle_fuzz: DE CO RAY TOR
[3:46:57] Gaz_H20: put a square object down and just put chairs at corners
[3:47:01] Vinn_: center the chairs to the middle of the table, then use snap movement bing bang boom ez peasy
[3:47:03] insomniaglc: 12 free 3 center 45 free
[3:47:08] mlkkk08: Make a square with the chairs
[3:47:08] Seduin: MONKA the chairs are in the shape of an X Susge
[3:47:22] isaias_lion: +45 everytime?
[3:47:23] ghostkiller631: the easiest way is to put 0, 90, 180, -90 in the chairs and then move them accordingly
[3:47:24] raj_r997: just to parallel to the walls?
[3:47:24] travisclock: How can it be a 6 by 5 you literally pleced a perfectly round object in the center??
[3:47:25] tillzl3y: 6 hexagon or pentagon isit
[3:47:42] dantikks: its a perfect circle it cannot be 5x6
[3:47:43] dayb0rn: just put them in a x and play with it
[3:47:44] h4des__20: How is this 6x5 it should be 6x6 no??
[3:47:44] insomniaglc: its a circle no side should be longer
[3:47:45] pierrot9998: Just make it 5.5
[3:47:45] fahd_g: put it on opposite sides it’s the easiest way
[3:47:48] ghostkiller631: It's actually 6x6
[3:47:49] CBtheNewB: dont you want to put 5 to symbol another and equal vote in the company?
[3:47:54] kan_zeus: You can take the position of the table and offset the x,z positions by same amount to each direction
[3:47:55] TeemSmeek: it can't be 6x5 it's a circle
[3:47:57] mlkkk08: And make sure each diagonal chairs are straight facing eachothers
[3:48:06] travisclock: It's a circle lol
[3:48:12] josaghi: u can place planks in a x shape on top of the table for reference
[3:48:13] isaias_lion: 0 90 180 270?
[3:48:17] Kiahmackley: hey deco Ray tor ❤️
[3:48:32] somerandomguy_97: 5*5
[3:48:36] rstineffect: @ray__c just start the chairs and the center of the table and move them to opposing side by the same amount using panel
[3:48:37] dantikks: 4Heaf
[3:48:43] dantikks: I can't type
[3:48:47] dayb0rn: overthinking it
[3:48:48] ghostkiller631: @isaias_lion -90 to flip the 1st 90
[3:48:48] Nultez: @Ray__C Cant you do it using the coordinate so if you want it at the corners add lets say 10 to x and y which will move it diagonally than for the other corners you would have to do ++, +-, -+, -- No?
[3:48:52] dantikks: I am the 4Head now
[3:49:01] travisclock: Holy cookedness
[3:49:17] fahd_g: drage it to the oposite side copy cords and get it back paste it on new chair it’s going to be a lot easier for you
[3:49:31] Kriea: Wouldn't a chair in the corner look better? Then just dissonant across and so on
[3:49:33] viko_ziz: white light for Yuno crystPray
[3:49:38] isaias_lion: @ghostkiller631 true
[3:49:39] dantikks: as long as they face each other it's fine
[3:49:40] Kriea: Diagonally **
[3:49:42] pierrot9998: Is it 1 s chair short?
[3:49:46] hellaslastchance: give each chair one of the 0, 90, 180, -90 coordinates and then move the chair to fit @Ray__C
[3:49:48] Kai_Roback32: Just make a 6x6 square with chairs and put the table in the middle.
[3:50:08] xxoxo_ry: i feel this table is just a lil too BIG esp if there’s no privacy for meetings
[3:50:09] ghostkiller631: give each chair one of the 0, 90, 180, -90 coordinates and then move the chair to fit @Ray__C
[3:50:42] Nultez: ^ or that making sure the chairs are tangent to the circle
[3:50:44] PeterDragon: RGB
[3:51:15] ErraticSwami: Buddha said a quality of life update is coming for the building ui

[4:40:29] imomoiro: true..also its the first time...maybe on other runs when you have more knowledge about the heist.
[4:40:40] Dnas3: It would be so so shit to die to sewer rat bonking or scuff after doing this job.
[4:40:44] MountainMAN1990: @dnas3 to Mickey it is.... just how it is
[4:40:45] 100BarsOfDeath: hopefully the job goes well because 350 butcoin sink is a lot
[4:40:46] orionn99_: what if cops are immune to the toxic gases

[4:40:59] erquilene: tbh.. 2 or 3 running into sewers and everyone runnign different way for you to escape easilyl while they bait them sounds liek better idea..
[4:41:01] mnsports83: Sewers with bait and switch would be sweet
[4:41:03] fahd_g: that would be great for you you know your way better
[4:41:05] RA1KAS: a city train escape would be cool
[4:41:15] imatastypill: @azdabsttv they don't know how hard it is to get away from cops now that their two best cars have 250% more health and go 170mph LUL

[7:33:08] Control_Jay: there was 2
[7:33:09] Alas_: i honestly thought there was gonna be more to it due to collecting 6 dongles
[7:33:09] L0KIDota: 2 hacks
[7:33:09] xandddddy0mc: 2
[7:33:09] czx_void: there was another door
[7:33:10] Sleeepyzz: easier than landromat tbh
[7:33:11] eldurablegamer: Cool, But waste of BUTCOIN
[7:33:11] nolimitjuan21: benji did 1 also
[7:33:11] roseyposey_19: did u go up the stairs at the back??
[7:33:12] eclaireg: @BOOOMIC yes they got away
[7:33:12] GigaChaaaaaaaaad: agreed. heist was awesome - reward is awkward
[7:33:13] VtuberLoverAlways: maybe you guys are missing something SCHIZO
[7:33:13] Genisyys_: exactly, it was simpler than laundry and 5 times the cost
[7:33:15] kronn505: Benji did the Chopchop hack
[7:33:15] phreakasso: hack was pretty wild tho
[7:33:16] fahd_g: 100k would have been good
[7:33:16] zdd2000: i think they may change it for the next people
[7:33:16] wishyouhappiness: the reward was trash for how much it cost
[7:33:17] pandalov: 2 hacks benji did 1
[7:33:17] interfistin: was 2 hacks
[7:33:18] chechlto1: it was a memory game and ray said I got this wideOmE
[7:33:18] akazplays: benji did the typing hack
[7:33:19] CeeJayySeven: 2 hacks max wood one shot them insane
[7:33:19] ElGeuso: what is it? 30k dollars? bills? bands?
[7:33:19] jessicaxo60: 2 Benji did other hack
[7:33:21] g_host_28: Payout was Pepega
[7:33:22] Firepokachu: guys we thank the schedule for this
[7:33:22] ZippoMan18: I missed the whole thing, I have to watch vod now. Sadge
[7:33:23] giga_mex: did we call kit back?
[7:33:24] TeemSmeek: @CaptainPriz3 just do laundromat for that lol
[7:33:25] elviz_u: ty MODS
[7:33:26] Phazibll: i think the heist would be kool if the back door didnt happen
[7:33:27] akazplays: he doesnt Aware
[7:33:28] JesseP98x: 4 laundry > 1 grouppe 6
[7:33:29] mimikosmos: cant believe the cops werent at the back door sooner KEKW
[7:33:30] L0KIDota: no not the back
[7:33:30] kilugradi: thats not a hack
[7:33:31] inaudiblecone: @giga_mex yeah
[7:33:32] VtuberLoverAlways: back back was hardest
[7:33:34] g_host_28: Yea the getaway was dope
[7:33:34] Kenturo: Probably something upstairs
[7:33:36] Ginge__4: 1 hack but looked fun
[7:33:36] KimParktsingLee: same amount of hacks as laundry no?
[7:33:38] baxsm: payout puts butc at 100 omE
[7:33:41] s0pran07: the promot said security doorS
[7:33:41] eldurablegamer: PP POO POO
[7:33:42] eclaireg: BELIEVERS UP GOOD LETSGO
[7:33:46] imatastypill: ...there was a stairway remember? @Ray__C surely there wasn't an upstairs floor you weren't supposed to clear too???
[7:33:46] MothicalNymph: I think they heard you climbing the fence at the back, which made them move towards the back entrance
[7:33:48] juudn: Yeah it was definitely not worth it money wise
[7:33:51] nizzara27: running out was good
[7:33:52] Discorecord1: there was a stair too outside in the back
[7:33:53] CeeJayySeven: did monkey man have anything for you??
[7:33:53] roseyposey_19: I loved watching it
[7:33:53] gateloz: @Ray__C what if the dongle is RNG and only appears sometimes like old fleeca's used to be
[7:33:54] eclaireg: running out the back door was the best part KEK
[7:33:56] Genisyys_: that was more the cops fault for not covering back door
[7:33:56] jamanneff: I think you should buy a company car NOW SeemsGood
[7:33:57] Alas_: the cops should have secured the area LUL
[7:33:57] VtuberLoverAlways: cops weren't ready it is what it is
[7:33:57] Phazibll: yes funny but plan didnt go as planned
[7:34:00] Buschem: imagine if you all left from the back door
[7:34:02] ubayd_udz: @Discorecord1 thats what I was thinking
[7:34:02] D_Y_I_N_G__: it was a nice heist but the rewards were so bad
[7:34:04] SunflowerJessie: also good for pd to remember theres a back
[7:34:04] elviz_u: if that it's the pay, but should be at a 100 KEKW
[7:34:08] itz_Vin: honestly backdoor made it realistic, a crim isn't gonna see an open chance and not take it KEKW
[7:34:08] kronn505: @Ray__C testing tier 1 on next heist?
[7:34:08] obrogames125: They where Clueless
[7:34:09] CaptainPriz3: @TeemSmeek Have we opened that safe yet?
[7:34:09] steelcityguy1981: maybe money shouldnt weigh sooo much
[7:34:10] ataraxia_19: Gonna hug Kit when she shows up?
[7:34:10] invincivisible: you probably got the payout for the lowest dongle tbh
[7:34:11] baxsm: @gateloz NAH, stakes too high
[7:34:12] chechlto1: it was funny but for cinematics was worse
[7:34:13] kilugradi: when crime is gonna pay out Aware
[7:34:19] xh1deous: yo ray
[7:34:19] VtuberLoverAlways: isn't that bike hot LUL
[7:34:19] Aidoegg: what were the devs thinking with that payout... why not adjust it as things go on considering how much it cost to start the job
[7:34:20] roseyposey_19: do u think the other exchange will have more money??
[7:34:20] Smittyj17: Ran out back just to get picked up for chase
[7:34:22] omgshroomie: maybe roof had hacks that open other doors???
[7:34:22] baxsm: @ataraxia_19 Parasocial ofc
[7:34:27] postnola420: that’s the advantage of going first. the cops don’t know either
[7:34:30] trekkky: I honestly think it was the tier 3 dongle it should be tier 1 man
[7:34:31] AstroDeft: Who got caught ??
[7:34:32] TeemSmeek: @CaptainPriz3, no
[7:34:32] dantikks: Surely crime will be worth it soon COPIUM
[7:34:36] emigzz854: maybe other door in the stairs at the back?
[7:34:37] mdghost420: hopefully the dev gods step in cuz that payout is horrendous
[7:34:38] g_host_28: Yuno call ? WideSus
[7:34:39] eclaireg: @baxsm gigl
[7:34:45] baxsm: @dantikks ome5
[7:34:45] Discorecord1: @ubayd_udz now we keep wondering LULW
[7:34:45] GimeDepusiBoss: half and half
[7:34:47] beckxs_: something isn’t right makes no sense that laundry mat is 20K + usb for only 50 btc and new heist is 250 btc and pays 45K
[7:34:47] riorobinio: 2k
[7:34:53] leon_cof96: only thing with doing the laundry instead is if you aren’t the first people to hit it that tsunami then you get no cash from it
[7:34:54] shawnlaw591: is he gonna go to kit?????
