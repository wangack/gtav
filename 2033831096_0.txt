[4:19:11] revoltzr: OMEGALAUGHING
[4:19:11] Seetherrr: After seeing things on this server I really like the A/S switch that cars had on NP, the current Scout is really good vs a lot of the cars in the city but gets blown out of the water by the good cars.  I think it would be nice to just adjust to the target even if it is a little immersion breaking
[4:19:20] LCmira: Stare
