[1:19:13] Witzz_: I think it would be one of those cases where if they hit someone then yeah it would be violet but just normal racing is not VAF point
[1:19:17] tom_ecko: if its a hwy then you knowing drove "reckless"

[3:36:39] Oh_no_melon: Prism in your glasses means one eye takes in light differently than the other, so it changes the way light enters your eyes to reduce double vision and other conditions.

[3:37:54] IamTorren: I was a manager at a BlockBuster and a bartender at a casino
[3:37:54] Runefinger: Streaming can get on you mentally i guess
[3:37:56] Burritoclock: Yeah, I think chat would drive me insane in 3 hours lol but still would rather that than warehouse work
[3:37:56] endure__: damn you are a job slut
[3:37:57] just_james69: i think working retail should be a capital punishment did that shit over lockdown and it was horrible
[3:37:59] Daggne: trying to be a streamer when you are just starting out can probably feel that way when you don't have money.
[3:37:59] SethV: I'm in IT and I consider leaving for something simpler every day
[3:38:00] pirate_ships: An actor NODDERS
[3:38:02] Dinguz: I'd think that in some ways I'd agree, but in others I'd highly disagree
[3:38:07] DanLGG: I work in customer service for a branch of DHS and it sucks but it pays good
[3:38:08] havvix4698: if you were comparing an office job with streaming, then yes i would agree. if you compare construction with streaming then no
[3:38:08] DJGari23: worked in bollywood NODDERS
[3:38:13] mjaaee: I lo ve my job, I can work whenever and also I can watch you stream! its great
[3:38:16] amber_bijoux: retail is the worst
[3:38:19] Adam1866: anyone who said that should be made to work a 48hr week in customer service
[3:38:23] Lupusdeus: You're so much more well rounded than a lot of streamers who know nothing other than sitting in front of a screen IMO - because u've done all those things
[3:38:34] Geralt_De_Rivia: I can see it from his point talking about politics has to drain your social energy
[3:38:34] amber_bijoux: I work in a pharmacy and it is hell on earth
[3:38:35] sychotixx: Plus no job security, no benefits, higher taxes
[3:38:41] Daggne: you can work your dream job.... you don't have to be sad working.
[3:38:42] CheeksVonDeeks: Streaming is risk vs stable salary which also has to be tiring?
[3:38:49] DJGari23: KEKW
[3:38:56] KnightsWhoSayREE: HUH
[3:38:58] MartMonster: HUH
[3:38:58] Adam1866: huh
[3:38:58] LevelUpMindy: I’d imagine the uncertainty of what your paycheck is each month would be difficult
[3:39:01] BluGiant: HUH
[3:39:01] Smit_The_Brit: Most Streamers who thing its stressful is because they stream double shifts compared to normal job!
[3:39:02] PandaNomsBamboo: LOL
[3:39:03] x_glazier_x: I would much rather stream than hang out the 12th floor of a building installing an 800lbs piece of glass
[3:39:04] BluGiant: HUH 󠀀
[3:39:06] Christian2920: It was on Discord, check mod chat
[3:39:07] Tutenkhame: that’s how I feel about my culinary job. been doing it for twelve years and love it
[3:39:11] FaceMcShooty: A lot of times streamer son't take weekends or days off. That is probably the most draining part.
[3:39:11] Deadlyguz: streaming u can just say ending stream and take yourself out of the situation. a real job u can't just leave without massive repercussions
[3:39:22] ianakaBoogie: oop
[3:39:25] lovelylildevilwings: lol
[3:39:26] NGVtv: I mean wouldnt that be a compliment? LUL
[3:39:58] Christian2920: Yeah...
[3:40:02] BluGiant: HUH
[3:40:08] Christian2920: I'm not dealing with that KEKW
[3:40:10] LevelUpMindy: @deadlyguz True, although some would say each day or hour gone is a potential drop in subcount which could create anxiety
[3:40:14] Adam1866: is it really work if its something you'd be doing in your free time anyway
[3:40:18] Fast_doughnut: Most self employed ppl dnt take days off LUL
[3:40:23] ar0jit: I can't even go out of my house because of anxiety
[3:40:34] lovelylildevilwings: 70 HOURS???
[3:40:40] lovelylildevilwings: did I hear you correctly?
[3:40:43] Veixa: I work 6-10 days a year and i love it
[3:40:45] Graewan: I tried to stream, but damn anxiety :3
[3:40:49] Fast_doughnut: Yup really is
[3:40:51] PandaNomsBamboo: No 13+ hrs streams Sadge
[3:40:52] Oh_no_melon: I think the strain of streaming really depends on where you live. Being a streamer in the US means you don't get benefits, have to deal with exceedingly difficult taxes each year and other things...
[3:40:59] lovelylildevilwings: oh...
[3:40:59] Geralt_De_Rivia: 70 hours a day crazy
[3:41:01] LevelUpMindy: The healthcare in US makes it terrible to be self employed, esp with family
[3:41:01] lovelylildevilwings: my bad
[3:41:03] the_only_tetra: @Graewan yeah am the same
[3:41:06] Boylez: The mortgage stuff being a streamer would be stressful
[3:41:16] Geralt_De_Rivia: I know KEKW
[3:41:17] mjaaee: I never take days off... co-owner of a company. year 5 and its starting to take out its right to be fair
[3:41:20] neklepsia: as a small business owner i take 7 days a year off
[3:41:25] sychotixx: Even Cohh had a hard time getting a mortgage cohhLUL
[3:41:29] TheGrandneko: uk is not welcoming of small businesses
[3:41:37] Oh_no_melon: And any form of loans is near impossible as "self employe.d"
[3:41:38] ConstyUK: Yup, freelance here is rough at times. In my industry the money is good, but the clients suck
[3:41:41] SethV: Cornwood schedule monkaW
[3:41:41] Geralt_De_Rivia: They probably think you're a drug dealer
[3:41:50] BluGiant: Nerdge Ackshually
[3:41:58] the_only_tetra: @neklepsia uhsPat hopefully in future you can grow and have more you time
[3:42:08] Veixa: I remember the days when i HAD to work... Those days sucked

[3:43:00] BluGiant: HUHH
[3:43:01] Burritoclock: Do you wife!?!? Sir?!?

[3:44:15] MartMonster: monkaW
[3:44:18] Daggne: dump trucks just falling from the sky
[3:44:28] JohnieP: I thunk Tobii said there's like a special visa for "influencers" or something.
[3:44:30] BluGiant: monkaX
[3:44:33] JohnieP: Think*
[3:44:34] havvix4698: landlords are scared of squatters
[3:44:59] Fast_doughnut: Also your house and stuff are safe if you go bust i think?
[3:45:00] RagingSantas: corporation tax is less that income nodders
[3:45:00] TitanKing5: That's what I do as a medical contract worker.
[3:45:07] RagingSantas: *than
[3:45:21] xseaka: yeah Tobii was talking about the influencer visa i think
[3:45:22] newt_gewt: check twaat
[3:45:24] Fast_doughnut: So i was told
[3:45:34] mjaaee: yupp. In sweden you have a few companies, earn money in one. Make it a resting company lock your money for 5 years, earn in a new company, and keep going around then you get a nice 15% tax I believe on entire sum you have int he company
[3:45:42] Scriix: I know there's us visas for e sports players so could see influencer ones in this day and age heh
[3:45:53] KnightsWhoSayREE: Hmm Do you mean going bald? @Fast_doughnut

[3:46:52] Fast_doughnut: No sorry not you. Just limited companies in genreral
[3:46:57] kryles: Apply and fin dout
[3:46:59] Christian2920: I'm good with my C1/D1 US visa kek

[4:32:21] mister_wrecked: Its a testament to modern gaming that after coming back form making food to see this racing stuff I wasn't immediately sure if we were looking at IRL or gaming footage for a minute.
[4:32:26] latertazor: Same sorta system though
[4:32:30] ben0809: @Christian2920 Stare
[4:32:31] Bakemaan: @latertazor energy recovery system?
[4:32:33] Christian2920: KERS and ERS are very similar
[4:32:36] latertazor: Yep yep
[4:32:44] Bakemaan: cool cool, i assume DRS is linked
[4:32:44] latertazor: Very similar
[4:32:45] walterwhite11: is there much drag racing in the UK?

[4:34:07] Bakemaan: @Christian2920 I always thought DRS was an assisted pass, its jsut the reduced drag?
[4:34:09] rexleonuk: thats fast

[4:41:24] Gigabyte_Afiq: i wish sepang back on roster tbh
[4:41:33] Forser: Yeah, the current F1 cars are to big for Monaco, maybe the 2026 cars will be a better fit since they are supposed to be shorter / less wide
[4:41:36] Iconoclast117: i am at Spielberg every year since it came back to austria

[4:56:31] StreamElements: Join Snow's Hotbox! https://discord.gg/Snow
[4:57:08] sendu6666: I think they said to wait about a week
[4:58:05] Athasin: Dude is making sense, what's the point of the higher vehicle if the law's weight limit is less than the higher vehicle's weight limit?
[4:58:30] BfAleTitan: its interesting they are putting in a charge to stop people from grinding efficiently
[4:58:36] Athasin: But then again... that's literally what they do with cars.
[4:58:49] greenburg22: if the normal truck is 1500 1000 would make sense maybe it scales w the bigger truck
[4:58:52] NamelessHermit: How it works irl, if you get a contract to transport 2 tons you transport 2 tons even if your vehicle is allowed to carry 10 tons. If not it's a breach of contract
[4:58:57] Athasin: A car can go 200 mph but the law says you can't only drive 60.
[4:59:03] Athasin: *can
[4:59:12] NextEraGamer: Well said
[4:59:24] MathiasTER: can you stack contracts?
[4:59:31] StreamElements: Yo!  Don't like ads?  Don't feel like being a gigachad and subbing? Twitch Turbo is for you!  https://www.twitch.tv/turbo
[4:59:34] GordoComeDoritos: I think the problem is what snow is saying right now, they are probably taking more than 1 contract at the time
[4:59:36] RagingSantas: @MathiasTER yes
[4:59:44] MrPhoNoodle: so if u take a total of 4000kg in contracts u must have 4000kg?
[5:00:18] DeeKoiii: Okay but that doesn't make sense to me either, you can't tell me a delivery driver is only going to drop off/pickup to a singular contracted location
[5:00:32] Adam1866: check the truckin the gas station haha
[5:00:37] DeeKoiii: I feel like stacking contracts is a common thing, even irl?
[5:00:45] TheOGWombat: i think what the driver is saying is that if they’re limiting weight to the amount that could fit in a grime van, why buy the big truck
[5:00:54] MathiasTER: is it potentially trying to stop people with bigger vehicles staking smaller contracts?
[5:00:57] buzzerktv: they want to make it a 1 contract per run, from what i gather and anything else over it would be bad news. however  his points on it are 100% valid, like why buy these advanced trucks to get railed by it
[5:01:10] DTalmer: The legislation is unfinished based on the announcement in discord.
[5:01:25] Prollos: also chat remember, this stop wouldnt have happened if he was following the law x0rSurprise
[5:02:06] RagingSantas: looks like the police need to implement more weighstation road blocks LUL
[5:02:26] Athasin: Even IRL there are trucks at drive are contracted to only drive to one location, specifically the trailer truck drivers driving across states.
[5:02:33] Athasin: *that are
[5:02:36] NamelessHermit: @DeeKoiii Yes, as long as there is space and doesn't exceed the weight limit of the vehicle and the road they mush as many contracts in there as possible
[5:03:16] DTalmer: I will say this as someone that does Grime. If they enforce this in the manor it "seems" to be going. Grime will be dead instantly. Its only profitable if you stack contracts. But we will have to wait and see what happens as its unfinished.
[5:03:33] SethV: In-game kind of blurs the line between last mile delivery and the large freight shipments
[5:03:48] buzzerktv: they would need to increase load volume IMO
[5:03:53] BfAleTitan: yea Grime seems like the one that doesn't really need more nerfing lol
[5:03:54] TheOGWombat: so limiting contracts = “daily “ money faster then go rp
[5:03:57] buzzerktv: full load is like 4-5k i think
[5:04:09] Lordminiw: 4-5k and it takes like 1h to do
[5:04:11] DTalmer: An hour you can make 3600 to 4200. 1000 in expenses
[5:04:20] MrPhoNoodle: like 2k but on a 3hr cooldown?
[5:04:21] DTalmer: 98000 invested in trucks
[5:04:25] greenburg22: less
[5:04:37] greenburg22: repair
[5:04:39] smirken: if they do only 500lb loads to fill up its around 5k ish an hour
[5:04:39] DTalmer: 800 in repairs due to milage, 200 in fuel
[5:04:41] BfAleTitan: the truck can also just randomly explode due to locals lol
[5:04:41] MrPhoNoodle: G6 makes less due to cooldown
[5:04:42] Gurgle_Firewater: trucks can run full day tho?
[5:04:42] statsky0: g6
