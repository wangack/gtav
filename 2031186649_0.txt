[3:28:15] Tarushaffxiv: the whole point of the game was to save the girls from the grunts not catch the girls i mean there a brunch of game over screen where the girls r captured

[5:28:13] bhavikmatic: it was a trash movie
[5:28:14] PonderDiggums: @abdulhd Woke isn't why Marvel quality has dropped. You can have woke content that's still well made (Last of Us is a good example). The problem with Marvel is it's been melted down into a most-viable product for the masses, so any woke content (or anything else that benefits from more depth) ends up ringing hollow. Imagine trying to make commentary on slavery or apartheid in a PG setting.
[5:28:15] CrossTheB0ss: napoleon was such a let down lol
