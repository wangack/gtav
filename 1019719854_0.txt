[3:09:49] ddirtmcgirt: so rich
[3:09:51] hugohuk: Has Ssaab ever said why he stopped playing Saab and plays Baas only now?
[3:09:52] Filikeu: Sugar cane farm (only whitelisted to civs 2/3 groups?) + (drugs, food business + etc would require sugar) = criminals would think twice before kill civs
[3:09:54] Mysteryhue: maybe because cop is a job and not all of the city can do it, so feel like you have a purpose? and everyday is different. maybe they could figure out stuff like that civs
[3:09:54] Pappa__Goose: Has poison been something ur still interested in pushing or has Lexi still been leading that

[3:09:57] karrotkake0: NODDERS you did call it
[3:09:57] SwizzMB: Yeah it‚Äôs a grind. I do miss Cartel style RP. On 2.0 when we got weed fields CG did the Changaloa and it was so cool. We need more hardened Cartel RP plz
[3:10:05] BADSELF: It just seems like in cop rp, there‚Äôs branches to go down and progression to look forward to. On crim there‚Äôs none of that, it‚Äôs either own 86 businesses or make 7k at a fleeca
[3:10:06] biglos28x: not a lot of groups and the ones that do exist hand hold kekw
[3:10:07] cashbandit88: @tinytoadtiddies I swear if siz and Buddha come together it‚Äôll be a RP for the ages

[3:11:18] r2green3: How big is the nopixel dev team?

[3:11:38] tally_one: I feel like Siz could turn into a good behind the scenes quest giver, if given the right tools
[3:11:39] KennyWolf: One streamer I was just plays a civilian who gets up to random hijinks. Grognak the destroyer attorney at law is their character name.

[3:12:21] MisterTohru: There should be an option to spend less up front to make shit quality meth to pump the streets with low quality meth for players to use for RP purposes
[3:12:29] syneesia: KEKW thin siz is a rare pokemon
[3:12:43] axolotli: maybe he'll finally remember siz now that hes skinny again Kappa

[3:12:54] MrWetCookie: house payment ?
[3:12:54] CarolusRex521: I would like to see maybe more insane things for the criminals to really do. Hell maybe try to incorporate all the places like the slaughter factory or government facility to add more to the intense side of crime
[3:12:57] cassdoodles: less tools now as well Sadge

[6:50:49] AndrewArt: @fentooz use your head, its not that hard to figure out lol
[6:50:51] friedmombo: no cop bikes yet, not sure if theyre getting them
[6:50:53] Zercs_: bikes should be banned
[6:50:54] FV_ImPuls3: Koil actually bans for people taking cars into the hospital wonder if he'd consider something like that for inside a bank?
[6:50:55] an_duuu: @fentooz its just boring
[6:50:55] leightones: @fentooz because there's scenerio where they get caught

[6:51:09] Astromune: sneaking a bike into the bank literally just wastes everyones time, might as well be playing normal gta if they're going to cheese like that
[6:51:13] RezaQ8: @I_Am_Fletch Nah
[6:51:18] HongKongFever: didn't bikes do more harm than good in 2.0?
[6:51:20] jacoblikesflowers: NODDERS
[6:51:21] HongKongFever: for cops
[6:51:26] Senpai_Niko_: I just feel like hiding the bike in the bank is cheesy after they made you guys get the comet
[6:51:26] Barnacle__Man: @jeled i think it could be good RP if u do it right
[6:51:26] pr4vus: he only banned someone for taking the car into the hospital cos it scuffed the beds
[6:51:28] changedmynameto: Now stack charges to make up for bank NODDERS
[6:51:28] kromestyle: Yes
[6:51:28] DeadpanGG: fkin Rhodes got serious
[6:51:30] JustYorick: serves them right
[6:51:33] I_Am_Fletch: @TheBananaL0RD wouldn't It make sense for them to create cop bikes as well and have atleast 2 for each bank robbery
[6:51:34] iphan123: bikes were amazing in 2.0
[6:51:34] SirPenguin911: Hiya @Rezathekiller2 uhnH
[6:51:34] an_duuu: bike probably had the loot though
[6:51:38] snurphles: Chat is analyzing the crims plan while @tombovard is holding down the siren fort KEKW
[6:51:41] GalatiaAK: Even if cops have bikes, it is still going to be difficult for cops to pit them
[6:51:42] Senpai_Niko_: Like you just can‚Äôt keep up with bikes
[6:51:45] Bossostrich305: @sirpenguin911 P E N G U I N PrideCute
[6:51:46] graydaemon: @HongKongFever Yeah, anytime a cop was leading a chase on a bike you had to be aware if they fell over at anytime the thing became a bomb.
[6:51:51] AndrewArt: when crims have vehicles that cops can't even keep up with, is it even a chase anymore
[6:51:53] TheBananaL0RD: @I_Am_Fletch I'm not honestly sure why they don't, it's probably been talked about before though
[6:51:54] RezaQ8: @SirPenguin911 Waddup friendo
[6:52:02] imSammers: By far one of the scummiest bank jobs I‚Äôve seen... I kinda feel like that was dirty
[6:52:03] SirPenguin911: @Bossostrich305 B O S S O uhnH
[6:52:08] graydaemon: @HongKongFever Not only that you could easily shoot off the person riding it / disable it.
[6:52:08] Jaco_Garci: @GalactusTheDevourer and then when they were offered cars instead of bikesbecause the cops were saying they cant handle bikes, they chose to hide that that they had more hidden
[6:52:14] otisbdriftwood_: vteCozy
[6:52:21] dovermo: @galatiafgo well I'm not sure why they can't get like 1 mustang

[6:52:31] graydaemon: @CozyShotz There was a bike hiding in the bank
[6:52:31] HongKongFever: @graydaemon ya i remember them not really helping
[6:52:31] Jeled: @Barnacle__Man It kinda defeats the whole purpose of a bank, which is working together. Im fine with 2 people but 1 is stupid cops irl would just shoot him.

[6:52:53] phongonqua: i wonder if even eddie or kylie would be able to keep up with a bike in that situation
[6:53:05] JohnOedmonton: womp womp fix
[6:53:09] syneesia: bikes getting nerfed when modCheck
[6:53:17] bajasatrio: the rat start
[6:53:23] leightones: there's no plan, beyond "bikes lul", no rp beyond the negotiations in paleto, no risk for the crims at all, which there should be taking into account they're robbing a bank.  scummy is the right word for it
[6:53:24] graydaemon: @syneesia Already done but they're still fast
[6:53:25] Shmeatylol: Lol people complain that theres too many cops on a chase when numbers don‚Äôt really matter when bikes outspeed every single one
[6:53:28] tombovard: just gotta spike the doorways from now on KEKW
[6:53:29] Thesupertoaster27: at least rhodes got the 2 guys in the comet
[6:53:31] OlDirtyTom: @syneesia, like a week ago
[6:53:31] GalactusTheDevourer: @jaco_garci Great observation! You get a gold star ‚≠êÔ∏è
[6:53:32] InvictoNZ: bike guy is probably already on his first oxy run
[6:53:32] jacoblikesflowers: cant keep up with bikes in the city, they can go stations / stairs. no one can keep up
[6:53:34] RezaQ8: I didnt expect the other 2 to be caught in the comet but at least that was
[6:53:34] galat_ine: Chat are there NPC characters in Nopixel or just people?
[6:53:42] graydaemon: @galat_ine "Locals"
[6:53:43] an_duuu: theres npcs
[6:53:45] nyancreeper_: !watchtime
[6:53:46] galat_ine: Gotcha
[6:53:50] Senpai_Niko_: Like can you even catch people on bikes?
[6:53:53] Schor2: Them asking to position the car makes alot of sense now
[6:53:59] dovermo: they should allow for a mustang at paleto
[6:53:59] Zercs_: why are bikes even still allowed if they're such a problem?
[6:54:04] graydaemon: @Senpai_Niko_ Yeah if you blast them the moment they get on.
[6:54:07] end01nferno: @leightones no risk for crims? other than an an hour or two to get out of hospital/jail, and a large fine, you mean?
[6:54:07] TheBananaL0RD: @Senpai_Niko_ if they crash yeah LULW
[6:54:12] owo_umu: how do you stop that in the future ? block the entrance with a car after the main subsects leave ?
[6:54:12] zatrepi: Like some 1 said Pd jsut need Motor unit after they play on even field
[6:54:18] qbaum30: #lost
[6:54:24] Kramer_: death penalty for dirty jaywalkers when?
[6:54:25] an_duuu: crims would rage if bikes were banned lol
[6:54:26] JohnOedmonton: wierd like lady o lake W?
[6:54:27] AgeOfTheGeek: It's more how the bikes are used that is the problem
[6:54:30] snurphles: @galat_ine Locals, which are the general npcs driving and walking around, and then static NPc's that have RP features to them
[6:54:30] AndrewArt: we should have a day where we swap roles, crims in cop cars and cops on bikes. Let's see if they understand how impossible it is to catch them
[6:54:30] vynfu: its manageable if cops have air 1 but otherwise its rough
[6:54:30] Nightbot: We? modCheck I didn't see you in there. uhnHm Tell us what uhnYou are doing in NoPixel uhnNotes
[6:54:31] InvictoNZ: bikes were nerfed hard in 2.0
[6:54:31] 0xygenhomie: that job is the vibe i get from 3.0 lol RP is secondary
[6:54:33] DesselRo2: @leightones its more then that, cops bring 5-10 cars, crims bring bikes, its a progression of force
[6:54:37] tombovard: it was seen as tryharding, now it's the standard because of the insane risk NODDERS
[6:54:37] feirondud: can you even seat 3 people in a comet?
[6:54:38] Arbiter9605: @dovermo they already got air1.
[6:54:39] jacoblikesflowers: bikes were way weaker in 2.0, feel they broke easy back then
[6:54:39] leightones: @end01nferno what risk is there when they're using a bike cops can't catch?
[6:54:44] TwilightPink: sfhTHINK
[6:54:45] DreH8Me: Wassup nova
[6:54:45] RezaQ8: NODDERS
[6:54:46] imSammers: Truuuue
[6:54:48] graydaemon: Yes.
[6:54:48] Senpai_Niko_: On jeez, so if they even break through they most likely to get away. I stinks
[6:54:48] TheBananaL0RD: getaway bikes would be a better idea, if they can't get away get on bikes
[6:54:50] 0xygenhomie: they built it this way
[6:54:52] Jaco_Garci: @GalactusTheDevourer glad you enjoyed how fun that chase was man! alsoShaggy alsoScoob
[6:54:54] de_puppy_cat: Does anyone know what Baas's sentence was?
[6:54:56] OdinGodOfVictory: The only getaway I enjoyed was the one with Flippy now that's real skill these chases are all the same now
[6:54:57] JoxerTheM1ghty: Just shoot the tires out of the bike as soon as it exits the bank
[6:54:58] bajasatrio: The Cheating..
[6:55:03] 0xygenhomie: when the buy in is so high, no one is gonna take chances
[6:55:04] sapeur: also in 2.0 bikes would blow up super easily so it was more risky using a bike
[6:55:07] syneesia: grinders can't read situations tho KEKW
[6:55:09] Actual_Nicotine: They've come to fore because of cop numbers, plus the amount of buy-in to do a job. In 2.0 doing a job cost nothing
[6:55:09] dexterity_77: your never gonna get that sing off dud
[6:55:17] Trains4lyf: when cops start buying their own vehicles will they be better than these slicktops right?
[6:55:17] graydaemon: You can thank "High" High Command revoking the limit on Air 1 in certain bank jobs too
[6:55:18] JohnOedmonton: tthey 2 front cuz 15 front
[6:55:20] bajasatrio: the audacity for cheating
[6:55:26] leightones: @end01nferno the most risk there was there was them maybe hitting a light pole or taking a turn too fast. that's it.
[6:55:27] gyozillaa: But I gotta get my W's bro MiniK

[6:56:09] Zercs_: I'm sorry you must deal with these hooligans. thank you for your service @uberhaxornova
[6:56:10] pr4vus: and there would have been air 1 even with Pred's limit
[6:56:12] imSammers: @uberhaxornova you stay that, but I thot dw said crims get away more on average
[6:56:13] HongKongFever: that's true and this was paleto anyways so there would always be an Air1
[6:56:14] Lamemo: is your car scuffed it was crashing a lot

[6:56:43] Jeled: Koil said cop bikes just lead to them getting shot when around a corner.
[6:56:46] xacktastic: @Div_the_Penguin the fact that we have to use the term balance is sad. Its an rp server, it shouldnt be competitive enough t need balance.
[6:56:46] texas_chainsaw_manager: :D

[7:00:35] Jeled: CG did the 8 hostage bike escape, next day Bondi boys did the mutli hostage bus escape
[7:00:35] savagekoala: they had limits for one EU shift the other day and robbers were like 6/7 in getaways at paleto. even with some good drivers like snow around
[7:00:36] MetaThw: You called it, that lady was like whats the odds on getting shot, and u said they probs got bikes
[7:00:36] Seagrand: Spiking the entrance/exit of the bank would counter it
[7:00:39] gunsomon: The meta
[7:00:40] syneesia: EZY money pepeW
[7:00:41] changedmynameto: Can you just spike them leaving if they pull the bike
[7:00:43] smokebu: I think the "issue" is the heist progression was set up to not be able to get away easily. bc that opens up higher tier too easily
[7:00:45] feirondud: crime needs to be risky
[7:00:54] zoocher_: Has the motorcycle in the bank happened before?
[7:00:56] VortexPD: koil and devs want all banks to be super hard because that's what banks heists are "supposed to be", so they tune that shit to the supposed CG standard and no one included has fun
[7:00:56] Niney_Who: I hate Metas in general
[7:00:56] St_Doritos: devs have said the heists were tuned to CG , so anyone hoping to be successful  will copy them for sure @uberhaxornova
[7:00:57] krykiet: where's fun in that
[7:00:58] yeadrose: see a spike in cop deaths if cops get bikes lmao
[7:01:01] FlareManN: I guess everyone chases the W so much, they forget its all for fun
[7:01:01] DreH8Me: Like i join on the problem like was someone fail rping or just cheating
[7:01:03] texas_chainsaw_manager: just atpSuspect
[7:01:03] an_duuu: @Seagrand the crims always specify for that not to happen
[7:01:04] SsjFourGohan: Sometimes banks feel like a win or lose rather than any rp being related to them :/

[7:01:14] UDedPray: would be cool if you could hack the bikes if given enough time and slow them down without crims realising LUL
[7:01:16] graydaemon: @Pancakezftw I think that's a little unfair. Crims gotta spend a good chunk of resources and time prepping for some of these heists they do. Sadly some are pushing it to the extreme.

[7:01:40] syneesia: what is going on dude Kreygasm
[7:01:41] RezaQ8: Vault was technically even harder because you had to do the powerplant first which was shoot on sight
[7:01:44] mnk_tropic: easy way to counter that would be  to park something in front of the bank doors with just enough room for them to get by? or would that just cause issues.
[7:01:48] SsjFourGohan: In all fairness bank robberies should be hard, if they weren't people would do them all day every day

[7:02:12] TheBananaL0RD: well they'd be kinda stupid to return on that bike
[7:02:14] an_duuu: @graydaemon I dont think its their fault, the crim stuff is way too grindy rn in fairness
[7:02:18] zoocher_: I just want fun heists back pepeW
