[1:00:02] robert__tokking: multiply by1.16
[1:00:03] Gashlex: ((m2+1)*100)
[1:00:04] SeedaSantos: i think

[1:00:10] killogic916: no. .. a % id asctial;ly .16
[1:00:12] tyforse: if 16% multiply by 1.16
[1:00:12] killogic916: so ass 1 to it
[1:00:14] killogic916: is 1.16
[1:00:18] funnkinn: m2 * 1
[1:01:17] nova_rubio: Add 100 to the percent and multiply by number so your one should be (100+16)*Property

[1:01:27] wytechocolate650: LUL

[1:18:03] killogic916: oh he did, just out of order on app
[1:18:03] ccoolracer128: is it 2?

[1:18:34] killogic916: 'should' have sold for 188 right?
[1:18:35] ItsEdBoi_: just do the calculated msrp
[1:18:47] ItsEdBoi_: only way to do it
[1:19:03] brok3ndreamzz: Public records?
[1:19:04] CopitoCAB: maybe drive to the house?
[1:19:10] 3xevilx: need someone inside the gov to tell you property tax payments
[1:19:14] koltonwarner88: ok but why is he doin all this lol
[1:19:14] ItsLowk: If they hide the real estate info, you should have some way to access it at the courthouse at least.
[1:19:15] funnkinn: take one of the unsold ones and the old calculated adjusted and find the percentage change of that
[1:19:19] killogic916: does it really matter exactly what it sold for? you just need to know how many sold to recalculate new prices
[1:19:34] Kdkuiper: this is going to be very had if more than one sells in a day
[1:20:02] ladyteeann: will you get a tax refund on the houses you paid tax on

[1:20:35] killogic916: do you think everyon1 will get a refund on cars and other shit bought?

[1:20:52] Skillah10s: @tread____ oh k
[1:20:54] 3xevilx: need mr. K master of records to tell you when the gov collects on house sale tax and back calc it's value
[1:20:55] Valerian120: you could also send this to K so he  knows what houses to rob
[1:20:56] nova_rubio: Why don’t you label each one with the address so you don’t have to search later on?
[1:21:06] ccoolracer128: you need someone to drive so you can do this :D

[1:27:52] 3xevilx: @ngendo20 k will give him a % of the biz
[1:27:59] ItsLowk: @ngendo20 Its a slow burn gain and most of it comes when the house is sold at a much higher price than what it was bought at.
[1:27:59] Dustbug: @JetfireZB makes sense

[1:31:59] ItsLowk: @irishmf_24 Every Tom, Dick and Harry civ worker shouldn't be able to own a house.  They rent.  That's how it works...also why K and Gomer are capitalizing on it
[1:32:06] DESHAWNTE: @JetfireZB did they devs add new houses yet?
[1:32:15] Kdkuiper: yeah once they starts the value of these will be so high later on, if you buy one of the first houses there
[1:32:23] stompas: the profit on the expensive house would be amazing if it was the first in the neighborhood to go.
[1:32:32] JetfireZB: @JetfireZB dont think so
[1:32:51] DESHAWNTE: @JetfireZB Ok ❤️
[1:33:15] LavosTRD: in hindsight, i think the better strategy was to get investors to become the "bank", and then go rent to own and charge people cost +20% for payment, that way you arent waiting for a house to sell
[1:33:37] ItsEdBoi_: Cracking into that market early is gonna be huge

[1:38:06] ItsEdBoi_: U not even doing # of investors anymore
[1:38:14] MissinMyTeeth: it’s gonna be investing into the company not into each individual house now
[1:38:27] ItsEdBoi_: Ur gonna need to increase the material prices, bigger houses
[1:38:30] nova_rubio: The RET is not going to be investors
[1:39:01] whizkidz22: REIT**

[1:39:56] whizkidz22: just maths
[1:40:07] itsmeebabes: I don’t either lol and I’ve heard ott explain it 3 times lmao
[1:40:21] ttvlilwrld: just yeet the reit
[1:40:21] jonathan_bellmont: they should have a API for hosue pricing and historical house pricing
[1:40:21] MissinMyTeeth: he drew out a diagram on stream the other day that broke it down good.
[1:40:24] tread____: You guys just have to get to the self sufficient part and become millionaires
[1:40:26] 0rder613: Think of the reit as its own company
[1:40:27] ItsEdBoi_: The simplest way he explained was basically fixed rate returns now
[1:40:34] whizkidz22: you promise a return and give them a return in x amount of months... just gives capital
[1:40:37] jonathan_bellmont: its like a REIT
[1:40:41] nova_rubio: Basically the "investors" give money to the company and the company spends it while promising to give the "investors" their money back and more with how they spend it
[1:40:45] TheTacticalDonut: the problem i have with the reit idea is, to pay out investors the house has to be sold
[1:41:01] stompas: correct
[1:41:05] ItsEdBoi_: Ur just gonna guarantee them x% over y amount of time, and u can just do whatever u please with the money
[1:41:08] ttvlilwrld: yes
[1:41:12] whizkidz22: @TheTacticalDonut negative it could be from rent as well
[1:41:12] Kdkuiper: thats why the rent to own is a lot easier and more people will go for it
[1:41:16] tread____: I feel like ott business model relies on people missing payments
[1:41:39] 0rder613: Kinda
[1:41:50] ItsEdBoi_: @TheTacticalDonut also what i was thinking, but with rent to own they can sync up the contracts with the investment turns
[1:41:50] ttvlilwrld: @tread____ well it will kinda work
[1:41:50] whizkidz22: negative but its a plus because then you own especially later on in the terms of the deal

[1:42:32] ItsEdBoi_: It doesnt rely on ppl missing payments thats just how u cash out big, it still works fine without it
[1:42:45] EvanEvin: it "Factors" default in, not relies on "default"
[1:42:47] BreezyBri: im too lazy to turn on music, wheres yours at today
[1:42:53] MissinMyTeeth: the rent to own is where the big money can be made I feel
[1:43:00] whizkidz22: @ItsLowk MONEY MONEY and a great fucking scene waching the tv show of them selling
[1:43:00] tread____: Why stop at houses cars rent to own would be just as good
[1:43:04] Kdkuiper: feel like moving forward if you can do the Reit, more people will rent to own with this model instead
[1:43:09] ttvlilwrld: after missing the rent what it they still dont pay up then what???
[1:43:10] ItsEdBoi_: Building Material price needs to be higher
[1:43:20] itsmeebabes: the reit won’t apply to the first two rentals right?
[1:43:30] whizkidz22: @itsmeebabes negative
[1:43:36] Kdkuiper: @ttvlilwrld the K takes the keys, and rents to someone new
[1:43:38] ItsLowk: @whizkidz22 kebunLuv
[1:43:56] tread____: The cars rent to own would help get the houses to the point where you don't need as much investment
[1:44:02] whizkidz22: @ItsLowk kebunREE kebunREE kebunREE
[1:44:06] ttvlilwrld: @Kdkuiper oohh yeh that works too
[1:44:23] ItsEdBoi_: Car rent to own is actually a sick idea
[1:44:24] us_ace: kebunEZ
[1:44:41] itsmeebabes: the spreadsheet looks great
[1:44:55] darkk_2k: kebunSmart
[1:45:07] whizkidz22: REITs in itself are difficult to understand but like boiled down to the basics it sounds way too easy to be a thing lmao
[1:45:23] Kdkuiper: car renting to own would be harder, K still owns the houses in the city now, for the cars that would be a lot harder with how the city works for the "renter" to get the car
[1:45:25] whizkidz22: but thats in the real world.... LS it makes so much sense
[1:45:38] atrayner: tax
[1:45:45] jonathan_bellmont: control + f 470
[1:45:45] itsmeebabes: yeah I don’t get it lol but it’s not for me to get so I’m just going to watch @whizkidz22  lol
[1:46:09] ItsEdBoi_: Thats correct, thats for houses sold and none are sold
[1:46:14] senkuzen: big maths
[1:46:25] whizkidz22: @itsmeebabes yeah not something to worry about now and if it works in the city of LS dont think its going to work for your pocket in the real world LMAO
[1:46:29] ItsLowk: UFC main event time!  Time to watch the homey's and the Gomeys!
[1:46:33] tread____: @kdkuiper yes but it's quicker money

[1:47:01] itsmeebabes: Is getting investors to put money into the company the same thing as a REIT ?
[1:47:12] yoshiebandit: yo
[1:47:19] Kdkuiper: @tread____ oh i agree, im just saying mechanics in the city would make it harder to get the car back, where as you can just change locks on the house
[1:47:44] itsmeebabes: @whizkidz22 definitely not worried about that! haha
[1:47:44] ItsEdBoi_: @itsmeebabes Kinda but no, they wont be apart of the company they will just be investors
[1:48:08] whizkidz22: @itsmeebabes they put money into a "fund" with a promised return of x amount in y (amount of time) so there is no property that the investors are in
[1:48:17] cbrooks51: With the REIT, OTT said its basically a hard money loan where the investor gets 1% to 2% return per week for 6ish weeks then they get their investment back and can re-enter the REIT to repeat
[1:48:50] fromthe906: Yes
[1:49:07] us_ace: I bet theres 20% tax on selling and you cant transfer a property to someone to avoid it
[1:49:19] fromthe906: investor total is off though. Should be 400,000
[1:49:33] itsmeebabes: @whizkidz22 oooo okay that makes more sense
[1:49:47] itsmeebabes: @itsedboi_ got ittttt
[1:49:50] Kdkuiper: @cbrooks51 yeah this or say they put in 100K for example, and then when they get paid back 125k they are out, then they can reinvest again, fixed rate returns too
[1:50:40] us_ace: you need to talk to ott, he smart af with this shit
[1:50:45] cbrooks51: @Kdkuiper true you can put a cap on the investment and not allow reinvestment
[1:51:08] whizkidz22: @itsmeebabes yeah so what they have been doing (having 6/7 investors per building) is out the window and now they have a big pool of cash from multiple investors and just need to pay them out in a certain amount of time
[1:51:10] us_ace: but he can explain how its gonna work
[1:51:28] ItsEdBoi_: REIT guarantees ownership of the house to the company, but they may run into a problem with paying investors without selling the houses
[1:51:40] mikemeunier: Did gomer hear who won the mayor election.

[1:52:02] GamerGoat007: Gomers books aer top tier
[1:52:14] Kdkuiper: @Kdkuiper they want the reinvestment, but  you get fully paid out on a set amount, vs like 3% forever as that could cost the company a lot more long term
[1:52:50] cbrooks51: @Kdkuiper I see what your saying
[1:52:53] Valerian120: K should use those books for house robberies aswell
[1:52:59] itsmeebabes: @whizkidz22 Okay I get it now! lol thank you for answering all my questions lmaoo
[1:53:00] shannon___xo: could K investments get a grant from the mayor couple of million to help
[1:53:11] MissinMyTeeth: I wanna see another day of k and gomer going to collect investors.

[1:53:36] indielm: Real estate excise tax

[1:53:53] whizkidz22: @itsmeebabes lmao no worries.... not like i do this thing for a living...
[1:54:15] cybigil: The legislation hasn't passed yet though.
[1:54:18] whizkidz22: @itsmeebabes happy to answer anything else!
[1:54:20] nova_rubio: I thought it was interesting
[1:54:27] ItsEdBoi_: The amount of houses itself is huge
[1:54:30] fromthe906: Hell yea...that is good data
[1:54:40] Kdkuiper: nah its interesting to watch and something others are not doing which is fun to see
[1:54:41] ItsEdBoi_: So do u have them all listed now?
[1:54:45] itsmeebabes: @whizkidz22 Thanks! I’m in the medical field so i definitely don’t know this stuff haha!
[1:54:53] dhanaz: good thing you did that at the start. because if you do it right now from the start it would be nightmare
[1:55:04] MissinMyTeeth: I think the next step is getting the legislation passed. then you guys can really get going
[1:55:41] Mordis_: What do the public records show? or do you have to look it up by name?
[1:55:51] darkk_2k: There was 3 sold
[1:55:52] Kdkuiper: can prob figure out backwards at least till the hit a 0000 ending in cost, may not know what order is all
[1:56:01] Radcrazykid2: Can’t you watch one of your old modules from when you looked at the tablet and the first time for Pulido
[1:56:17] Jayl0cked: It would be whatever the lowest current price <2% right. If it goes up by 1% each sale
[1:56:23] whizkidz22: @itsmeebabes wanted to go into medical but ended up in finance
[1:56:36] ItsEdBoi_: U can look them up at courthouse if u can figure out the owners
[1:56:47] CopitoCAB: if u go to the houses and open the tablet does it say the amount or that its gone too?
[1:56:48] haloaragorn: 3 were sold, all right next to each other

[2:18:01] Essageo: also depends on its decay rate, as that may be much slower
[2:18:02] ItsEdBoi_: Well its the same efficiency and it costs 5 coins, twice the crafting cost twice the output
[2:18:16] og_mo0dieh: oh u got a rack now huh? Kappa
[2:18:20] us_ace: yall are at a good pace rn i think
[2:18:32] Asithious: double the mats of a normal gpu. and you can only make 2 per blueprint,
[2:18:50] Hey_its_Mady: If you want to be efficient then bigger GPU should be only in pc desk to double that output
[2:18:52] Enahz_: Did you link the racks together
[2:18:56] ItsEdBoi_: its good eventually but setting up 3 racks of normal gpus is more efficient use of BTC
[2:19:17] cybigil: It's not a scam once you facotor in time.  Yes it's double the cost for double the output, but when you double that out, and the double it the next day, and the next... it's no longer a scam.

[2:23:03] LavosTRD: @cybigil true, but until anyone knows better you have to run the math in the worse case, 1 to 1
[2:23:06] RisKkeyy: Murphy a thug now, he's facing murder charges

[2:24:09] RisKkeyy: Lollypop just won a 10k rap battle
[2:24:23] LavosTRD: so day 13 is break even for upgraded, in that time the standard gpu would have mined 2.6 coins, it would take another 13 days to become more profitable than the standard to 26 days to be a better investment
[2:24:34] Kdkuiper: lol gotta tell him that’s on new not current investments
