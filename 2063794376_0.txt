[3:59:58] wizardiis: NODDERS But it will probably happen too late for me
[4:00:02] Thrath: Weirdly enough I think the way the crim side is setup is kinda perfect for Andi
[4:01:00] Thrath: Just the way its all linked makes for good progression
[4:01:00] Vizi797: Yea, like I recognize staying up that late all the time may have been gruesome, but the casino era stream were always great
[4:02:42] Vizi797: That's like 40 bucks just laying on the ground NODDERS
[4:02:48] Thrath: Its like 6-8 per mat it will add up eventually NODDERS

[4:37:34] lichadez: focus town
[4:37:39] zeman94: I can see why people priced everything so high now kekw
[4:37:50] Rablit: Mayor of the lspd.
[4:37:51] veteran_porkchop: initial plan for the Paleto town community yeah
[4:37:55] Thrath: kivaSus Could go crazy with Yaeger
[4:38:04] inus2: survivor, or business/fun stuff
[4:38:18] toad1337: town stuff for sure but also the rag tag stuff that never really got a chance to take off back in 3.0 NODDERS
[4:38:24] zeman94: Idk I'd like to see her just finding friends and hanging out with more gangs
[4:38:52] Anrisacia: As much as it would be nice to see Andi have a small, tight knit group like she was talking about earlier, it would be nice to see her try something with new people if that's not possible
[4:39:38] dizzieb88: Let Nana go wild with Paleto gang gang stuff. Andi goes spends time with her brother, could be a vibe
[4:39:44] MacabreOS: the way folks hang on to peoples past , it seem like it would be better to have a new character, to do wild things with yeager
[4:40:03] DJ_4point0: Would she 'join' another group? In any capacity.
[4:40:12] zeman94: Idk if you'd wanna join other gangs but just hanging with people she didn't before would be cool
[4:40:17] lichadez: recruit barry and hubcap into the JCF
[4:40:52] Anrisacia: Yeah ADMC just doesn't seem like the same vibe that Andi brings
[4:42:20] aconfused_melon: she could focus on helping in parks and Rec
[4:42:54] dizzieb88: Need the Ragtag group of Renegades
[4:42:56] MacabreOS: doc or vet?
[4:43:24] veteran_porkchop: Andi, Pigeon, TJ, and some other like minded people up to some shenanigans uwuBLESS
[4:43:46] zeman94: Idk I just see her solo and hanging with people she wants to without a group
[4:44:01] Vizi797: Andi, Reed, Stanley, Hades like you said earlier would probably be really really fun
[4:44:11] Anrisacia: It's too bad Michael has such a different schedule. A group with both him and Andi would be fun
[4:44:13] toad1337: I think alot of the people Andi has brought in would follow in whatever she'd want to do NODDERS
[4:44:30] aconfused_melon: you have to have group to progress in anything
[4:45:16] wizardiis: kivaLUL
[4:46:05] GlitchBye: yes Reed yes
[4:46:18] Thrath: If anything yeah I could see DD making a return with Andi, Reed and Lizzie
[4:46:30] dizzieb88: Ed would've been a top choice too but hey ho
[4:46:47] slin7563: Join Siz, in retirement and leave it all to Stanley.
[4:46:52] honor234567: fun stuff with shang maybe
[4:48:23] dizzieb88: To be ragtag, yeh, that's what I mean, if that wasn't guaranteed for him etc. He would've been perfect for silly etc
[4:49:32] veteran_porkchop: running a small crew doesn’t seem too viable in 4.0 with how much work it takes to reach certain goals uwuHANDS
[4:49:55] GD_Kotorou: T-Rex arms.
[4:51:30] inus2: yeah unless the small group only does silly stuff the amount of work each member would have to do would prob lead to crazy burnout quickly
[4:51:31] wizardiis: kivaM
[4:53:01] GlitchBye: rooMop

[4:53:52] Anrisacia: I think there would be some surprises as far as groups who would want Andi if they were aware she were available as a pick up
[4:54:05] zeman94: I think if Andi put out she was looking for a new group there would be lots ask
[4:54:34] inus2: imagine having an interview day for groups if Andi went independent, have reps from each one come in and make their pitch to her KEKW
[4:54:50] lock0nsix: yeah probably LOTS that would want her but i can't really think of any that she would realistically fit in
[4:55:08] veteran_porkchop: a day with Dab and Andi being silly would be a lot of fun uwuCOPIUM
[4:55:13] GlitchBye: Any thought of Law stuff again?  rooThink
[4:56:04] Vizi797: I feel like there's very little chance Andi isn't a felon by the time this hypothetical could happen as well
[4:56:29] inus2: and expungements seem basically impossible so locked in to crime then NODDERS
[4:56:40] Vizi797: I was gonna say tomorrow, but I didn't want to jinx the job KEKW
[4:57:22] Thrath: If anything most events are run by felons
[4:57:26] inus2: im kinda surprised no one in the district was interested in being a lawyer for the group, seems like having an in-house lawyer would be hugely beneficial for 4.0 like murphy for cg in 3.0 kinda
[4:58:46] aconfused_melon: NODDERS a fresh start is a better route imo
[4:58:46] Thrath: Yeah its not like Andi hasn't been around a long time now as is
[4:58:52] CautiousDani: new baby crim peepoHappy
[4:58:59] inus2: what would a retirement for andi look like given her family lore for the timeskip and not really having somewhere to go?
[4:59:21] inus2: just curious on how she might end up besides dead from Pilbis killing her
[4:59:49] toad1337: death by bicycle Sadge
[4:59:50] Thrath: I'd say if anything for Andi the beef wipe kinda just reignited the amount of connections she once had
[4:59:52] inus2: KEKW the bicycle incident
[5:00:14] CautiousDani: kivaAwh
[5:00:32] Anrisacia: Yeah being well known is a two-edged sword, where it's great for having those connections, but it feels like it also immediately pigeon-holes them
[5:00:32] aconfused_melon: peepoHappy dying alone
[5:00:32] Nightbot: peepoHappy
[5:00:34] Random_Slacker: ngl the camping era was some of my favorite.. less mechanical bs, just more conversational rp
[5:00:52] Thrath: I could see the day white hair Andi flies out Gladge
[5:01:04] dizzieb88: Could find Collins ranch? Take an AK as a gift
[5:01:08] CautiousDani: with dog named, Foul NODDERS
[5:02:03] Anrisacia: Not even part of something, but the very person they are. Like let's face it, everyone comes to Andi about business stuff, or mayor stuff, or w/e kind of thing tangential to that. And that's even though it's been literal years since she's had anything to do with it
[5:02:38] CautiousDani: Was so excited for camping days, the bingos
[5:02:56] CautiousDani: top tier camping arc fr
[5:03:07] inus2: the hiking trip with Collin was hillarious during camping
[5:03:54] inus2: mmm for me personally it was just my favorite rp to watch, very conversation heavy less mechanics than crime
[5:03:56] zeman94: Collin comes back and they make a group kekw
[5:04:01] dizzieb88: Finally make the soup with Collin
[5:04:10] lblvckmvgicl: andi does whatever the fuck makes andi happy NODDERS
[5:04:49] Random_Slacker: honestly not a huge fan of the crim side of rp.. so would be cool to just have a hut in the woods
[5:04:52] Random_Slacker: wise andi of the woods arc
[5:05:46] Anrisacia: Corn please! kivaDesk
[5:05:55] inus2: corn is real but only for sunday dinner
[5:06:00] Vizi797: #CornIsALie
[5:06:02] inus2: lake taught us that NODDERS
[5:06:10] Rablit: If corn isent real then my whole life is a lie. kivaSOULS kivaSOULS
[5:06:22] Thrath: I do agree conversational stuff has easily been my favorite RP but its from both sides like the old Stanton and Andi days or Andi and Norman etc
[5:07:23] wizardiis: peepoPog
[5:07:31] inus2: mandi bones, heir to norman's legacy peepoPog
[5:07:38] dizzieb88: Best RP moment for me was Norman telling Andi she wasn't alone
[5:07:47] CautiousDani: peepoPog what would their name be?
[5:08:04] wizardiis: corn LETSGOOO
[5:08:10] MacabreOS: i think conversations give the audience something to focus on where mechanics are for the player
[5:08:15] Rablit: COOOOOORN
[5:10:52] Random_Slacker: had any thought of bringing tilly over? idk if you had any longer term plans with that char
[5:11:26] zeman94: So would it be someone to eventually replace playing ant or playing both
[5:12:06] Sapphire_Tears: LUL
