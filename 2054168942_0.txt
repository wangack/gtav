[0:59:39] funkie: Amazing no one called trygg a dane
[0:59:40] Fossabot: REMINDER: Backseating and Meta'ing is cringe. We do not want to see suggestions of where they should or should not look, do, etc. Nor should you remind the streamer of things he has forgotten. Him forgetting is part of the RP fun. 4.0 is new, unknown and exciting. Do not ruin the experience for the streamer (or chat) with your unwanted comments. You will get bopped into the next century. 🙂

[1:00:13] Firehead94: gotta make the PD NIST 800-171 compliant
[1:00:16] Ender_Panda: Imagine someone permas to trygg's 26k iso
[1:00:21] Duckonquack: I went through a few ISO certs, it was an interesting process
[1:00:36] funkie: So setting up a business and having to go through all 25000 ISOs has to be rough?
[1:00:51] LadyGray_: Clean desk policy *laughs in wfh*

[1:01:24] RebornOffline: Yeah, I can't even imagine the chaos there would be without ISO
[1:01:34] Firehead94: yeah, were working on implementing 800-53 right now and then pushing towards SOX II in the next few years
[1:01:37] Ender_Panda: There's ISO compliants for socks!?
[1:01:51] Count_Nodonora: I can second what he says. I've been involved in maintaining ISO27001/SOC2/PCI-DSS certifications with my company for over 5 years now.... that's basically all you think about all day..... It's so much stuff but all of it makes sense.
[1:01:56] AlexGabi27: Imagine ISO as a guideline that helps drummers and audio engineers achieve a consistent and reliable recording quality.
[1:01:57] JPkyy: there’s ISO for everything
[1:01:58] lalablacksheep9: @LadyGray_ You ever walk into a doctors office and the receptionist has documents all over the workspace that are clearly visible? Cleary never heard of ISO clean desk standards
[1:02:23] Firehead94: ISO 14632 applies to sock colors
[1:03:12] batperson: you ever see that meme that goes "there are 14 competing standards. we need to develop a universal standard that covers everyones use cases!... there are now 15 competing standards"
