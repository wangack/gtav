[0:51:28] SlashThePriest: Android has so many different phones tho, you can't put them all in the same bucket
[0:51:30] twitchmeat24: Samsungs blow up right?
[0:51:31] Moldrup4K: I have had 3 iphones. all of them have legitimately exploded in my hand because of the battery
[0:51:35] dewvoltage88: I've had a11 for last 12 years
[0:51:47] Lunar_Delta: Bixby is useless. I fucking hate that they switched holding the power button from turning off the phone to turning on Bixby just to get people to use it.
[0:51:47] neybersaber: sounds like user error
[0:51:55] kaggez: That sounds like a user problem.

[0:52:25] Lunar_Delta: so replace the battery for $50, dont spend $1300 on an iphone instead
[0:52:25] come_whatever_may: the only thing I miss about android is that you could restart the phone.
[0:52:29] Nomad_Ninja: doesn't matter the phone maker... its the amount of background apps you have running at any given time
[0:52:36] WikiDic: its a skillissue problem
[0:52:41] neybersaber: whipNom whipNom whipNom

[0:52:54] MikeOnSky: bro, android phones are over iphones 1000%, you don't have to pay to every single app that you need
[0:53:00] neybersaber: definitely skill issue
[0:53:02] Nomad_Ninja: how often email updates, how often location is used, bluetooth, wifi, etc
[0:53:09] kevin_27: the battery just sucked

[0:53:44] trainergames: i think it is a samsung issue lol, because i used to have problems with them, i have a different android now and don't have any after 2 years of owning it.
[0:53:44] Eggcellent: thats insane ngl
[0:53:51] anuphev: porn tired phone man, you need to let it rest
[0:53:54] Nomad_Ninja: my S23 Ultra lasts me 2 fulld ays between charges

[0:54:06] amras1987: @Whippy server is down
[0:54:17] WikiDic: it was the malware running in background he got from looking at porn
[0:54:20] amras1987: @Whippy they released something new, and then shut the server down after tsunami
[0:54:20] theextremelylongnamekid: I had similar issues, you may have downloaded a virus that’s draining your battery
[0:54:32] dewvoltage88: My s20 haven't charged it in 2 days and still at 53 percent and I use my phone alot ....
[0:54:37] accidental_isg: Don't they do the same thing when a new iPhone comes out tho?

[0:55:19] lordofspin: as phones get older the battery life's get worse.
[0:55:26] Lunar_Delta: Apple artifically drains batteries dont they
[0:55:29] twitchmeat24: the battery secret is the child labor
[0:55:32] dewvoltage88: Damm red @kaelath_the_red
[0:55:34] katiebugthethug: iphones are sooooo good out of the box, then they deteriorate fast. learned that the hard way with the water resistancey
[0:55:40] trainergames: apple nerfs old phone to make you want to buy a new one
[0:55:43] Nomad_Ninja: taking away the ability to easily replace the battery is the new way of ensuring you buy a new device often enough for them to stay in business
[0:55:50] neybersaber: i miss my samsung galaxy s3
[0:55:54] theextremelylongnamekid: the battery gets worn and looses the capacity, don’t charge to 100% all the time and it’ll help
[0:56:00] deeddubb: Do you have a pen liscense?
[0:56:00] Lunar_Delta: @Kaelath_The_Red same with my S21 Ultra but it charges fast
[0:56:03] lordofspin: that is how rechargable batteries work in general. older it gets worse the capacity and drain
[0:56:08] Kaelath_The_Red: I have all the battery saving shit on it too and it still drains itself sitting on the desk
[0:56:27] shadyobster56: I dont know about other phones but my Iphone charges insanely fast so battery never feels like an issue
[0:56:28] Nomad_Ninja: LET THE BATTERY DIE occasionally to keep it in best shape

[0:56:34] badguyzrules: I use an iPhone 4 for my music. I charge it once a month

[0:57:47] MegaKarp101: As a former radio shack/Sprint employee batteries degrade over time because of plenty factors, if it expose to severe heat, over charging, even some phone updates can degrade batteries (look at you apple)

[0:58:37] Kaelath_The_Red: kinamaHappyW Palworld is great it has monkeys with AK's PepegaGun
[0:58:37] sao_mito: Pokemon <3

[0:59:39] Bacon_Space: I have been so much fun with pal world then on Pokemon scarlet
[0:59:45] vincj002: behind pubg
[1:00:00] sao_mito: Palworld is free for me
[1:00:01] FriendlyAF88: Whippy ur forgetting Pokémon ripped off dragon quest
[1:00:01] iEnzan: I wouldnt say it takes much to create it. I think 2023 had so many shit games, that this game being decent is making it look like a AAA game.
[1:00:04] TylaBlue: its cool as hell
[1:00:05] TheStarRoom: Did you know that the Devs had NO IDEA how to make a game
[1:00:05] Lunar_Delta: I dont see the appeal of PalWorld though.

[1:00:10] Bacon_Space: How much is Pokemon scarlet in your currency whippy
[1:00:12] Br0ckthe_r0ck: Xbox game pass
[1:00:12] anuphev: it will die off eventually, CS wont
[1:00:17] MegaKarp101: As a person with almost 40 hours in palworld isn't even comparable to pokemon(which I've been playing since I was 6)
[1:00:18] Kinson1: If it is free to play, that means it will have zero sales
[1:00:20] TylaBlue: @TheStarRoom wasnt there just 1 guy who taught them all?
[1:00:30] vincj002: I even play it on my steam deck and it work good
[1:00:34] Chris7420: check on steamdb whippy on the concurrent players of palworld LUL
[1:00:36] TheStarRoom: no legit, they had actually no clue. They learnt on the job
[1:00:36] TheAngrierAvocado: best part of palworld is it's Ark if Ark worked
[1:00:37] Br0ckthe_r0ck: pal world on Xbox game pass so it’s easy to get for 1$
[1:00:49] iEnzan: I come from Ark, and this being close to it is what makes me play it. Ark kind of ruined themselves lol

[1:01:16] vincj002: palworld is pretty
[1:01:30] Just_Connor__: palworld is pretty overhyped
[1:01:31] Fossabot:  Advice, help, suggestions, or anything else of that nature, keep to yourself. That's back-seating. He is playing his own character and needs to do what he wants without chat influence, unless specifically asked for.
[1:01:32] Just_Connor__: imo
[1:01:36] Lunar_Delta: Why?
[1:01:44] Shadowfyre: Palworld is amazing
[1:01:51] iEnzan: 90% of those players are stuck on an infinite loading screen B)
[1:02:00] MegaKarp101: Palworld is fun though

[1:02:23] Shadowfyre: @iEnzan I actually have spent about 8 hrs and I finally got my GF's game to let her own my server lol
[1:02:25] slyoperator: Palworld is addictive YEP
[1:02:29] TheAngrierAvocado: it's on PC gamepass too
[1:02:34] Valroz: they announced palworld in 2021
[1:02:37] Bacon_Space: Whippy apparently pal world is getting threats because pokemon fans are insane
[1:02:38] sao_mito: On PC gamepass
[1:02:39] Just_Connor__: gamepass version has no "Quit" button you are forced to alt+f4
[1:02:42] MegaKarp101: Palworld is better on console than gamepass
[1:02:43] Br0ckthe_r0ck: game pass allows for the pc version
[1:02:51] MegaKarp101: I mean pc not console
[1:02:51] B_aguette_: It is on PC gamepass, but you will be limited on certain features
[1:03:04] theextremelylongnamekid: still have to pay for gamepass
[1:03:06] iEnzan: @Shadowfyre 2 days straight for me. I JUST got in my official server, and It's only me in it atm lmao
[1:03:08] Shadowfyre: yeah the steam build is 1 build ahead of the console version
[1:03:11] tyrranicus222: WOW

[4:37:21] AnonymousTrace_: You were tryna play the safe game & be a civilian. While in the beginning it was fun, it’s not what people know Dundee for. The other thing is the city doesn’t have too much to offer *yet* as far as criminal activity so it’s playing catch-up on what’s happening currently.
