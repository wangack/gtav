Go into Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Windows Update. To the right you'll see a list where it'll say configure automatic updates.

[9:09:23] raph1387: @reyvenhd thx
[9:09:25] puppersgoesbork: you can still check people if the give you permission to check
[9:09:26] tnseeo: NODDERS I hope Ranger only for exclusive
[9:09:28] Delfryngr: Espinoz fighting two judges right now PepeLaugh
[9:09:29] PAID_ACTOR1: 4Head yes
[9:09:33] generoustyrant: yeah that's why you need to articulate as they say and use evidence
[9:09:36] puppersgoesbork: just trick them :)
[9:09:39] dszklarz: PepeLaugh judd gonna be writing up new laws after this
[9:09:40] 2Grande: ohhhh espinoz getting hit with a counter suit for grand theft auto JamesPog
[9:09:40] Plagueless95: game wardens actually dont need reasonable suspicion to check a hunters haul, at least irl in most states including CA
[9:09:42] sapeur: how would fishing work then as you cant see the fish ?
[9:09:42] itsmemusicforcars: dang this really needs to be cleared up then
[9:09:44] Its_Big_Boi: depends how Los Santos laws go. Game wardens can search you all they want if you are hunter LUL
[9:09:54] changedmynameto: Finding a dead banned animal would be sufficient as well right?
[9:09:56] PAID_ACTOR1: @generoustyrant, yep like leaving the scene of a dead dog, etc
[9:09:57] Jenna_BeIl: stake out with binoculars and video camera thats how you catch people instead of driving around asking for ids and searching trunks
[9:09:57] Indelacio_co_uk: That'd be typical take the job, job changes so you can't do anything
[9:09:59] Thesupertoaster27: there's only 5 rangers so it'd be hard
[9:10:06] ThatOneJak: Hide hot when there is a call for poaching that is plausible cause to check everyone in the hunting area of for pellets
[9:10:10] PAID_ACTOR1: according to his logic, you're not
[9:10:22] fanzine97: In real life Game Wardens have the most leeway to search for that stuff compared to other cops
[9:10:22] itsmemusicforcars: what is the truth monkaHmm
[9:10:28] YewFancy: Depending on this case, hunting really will be the next oxy type investigation lol
[9:10:28] Huso833: Who's the judge I've never seen this guy around
[9:10:29] karmatunafish: Do cops not like being rangers?

[9:10:36] h0neybadgerz: What?
[9:10:37] jacoblikesflowers: ???
[9:10:38] JazzPimp: Judd said he could present the things he caught but you can't search supposedly @uberhaxornova
[9:10:39] badLiveware: Sops can be illegal
[9:10:45] h0neybadgerz: Physical is a blurry line? Huh
[9:10:46] clientnotfound: @UberHaxorNova he said he was hunting. Thus he is subject to search
[9:10:47] sirmexicanfish: LUL
[9:10:49] tastysteambuns: ratJAM
[9:10:51] Loafpox: Yeah I understand why it might feel unfair to some people, but if it was the other way around then rangers could do nothing about poaching

[9:10:51] Nightbot: Jammies
[9:10:52] generoustyrant: LUL
[9:10:55] sonasne: it would be pretty cool if rangers are the only unit who don't need RS to check licenses/catch because checking them is an ordinary part of their job
[9:10:59] PAID_ACTOR1: theres a chance monkaHmm
[9:10:59] Thomarse: Physical ID's would never go away IRL or in game, huh uhnKek

[9:11:14] bbotaa: Isn't it an illegal area he admited hunting on?
[9:11:18] sharkczar: ILLEGAL animals are present at the same time as legal animals in the hunting zone so there is an equal opportunity for poaching and hunting @changedmynameto
[9:11:19] tnseeo: New laws again LULW
[9:11:19] hacknslash548: monkaHmm

[9:13:57] sharkczar: @GalactusTheDevourer LMFAAOOOOO no he used to be in loss prevention which is basically workingat a store and telling people not to steal so he's gone to court a few times when people shoplift.

[9:15:39] IronXideS: Yeah I think it being a ranger thing would be good
[9:15:41] fanzine97: yeah Rangers on the server are basically the game wardens
[9:15:41] SubarooWRX: i feel that would limit anyone being able to do anything outside of the city unless it was only rangers then, bcso would never go north (less than they do)
[9:16:05] puppersgoesbork: limesSip
[9:16:05] karmatunafish: I see I was curious cuz I see a lot of cop players complain about certain judges

[9:17:07] Cornstalk89: I Know in MN for years there was a loophole where the game wardens could just walk right in to your ice fishing house to check it out, no warrant or suspicion needed. these things can get muddy in RL too.

[9:18:51] JazzPimp: yea if illegal hunters/batters and poachers shit their pants when Barry briddle rolled up the mountain that'd be cool
[9:18:59] Thomarse: Context matters

[9:20:00] JazzPimp: ye Judd will stop using plainview vehicles
[9:20:05] sharkczar: Bait is specifically used for hunting and almost no other purpose compared to a tire iron that can be used in multiple cases
[9:20:08] KaridonKaar: Plain View is a bit of a Reggie argument KEKW
[9:20:12] Keyhall: rangers should be able to search cause they need to make sure people arent hunting illegal animals
[9:20:15] RDestruction: its also kind of power gaming because the game doesn't visualise the pelts in the back
[9:20:19] BilboBuckins: Time for ranger grappling hooks in the trees for perfect pictures of hunters NODDERS
[9:20:20] itsmemusicforcars: yeah or people gotta rp they have a blanket
[9:20:20] puppersgoesbork: it's as simple as just asking the person for permission to check.

[9:20:30] mlensed: Also The parks and Rec department has nothing to do with this…
[9:20:31] Thomarse: Nakkida has said it isn't @RDestruction

[9:23:36] sharkczar: @selfDisgust bro I been trying holy shit we got mad hoppers
[9:23:45] tastysteambuns: I mean realistically doing poaching like oxy is hard with the number of people in the hunting area
[9:23:46] Smudge76: You will never be able to find out if someone is poaching. If someone is hunting then Game wardens have the abilty to check all their kills because if they did poach they are to face the repercussions of their crimes
[9:23:58] EtherealHope: If it's on Public Land, you are completely leaving yourself to get searched. If it's Private Land, then you have more rights of denying searchs and such.
[9:23:58] h0neybadgerz: I feel like proper PC could even be as small as hunting involves firing a weapon and checking to see the legality of said firearm is proper enough to search a vehicle
[9:24:10] Amaze_GG: this could set a dangerous precedent for hunting checks
