[0:55:08] TheRealStanchez: cops feel even more hands tied now, than they ever were in 3.0
[0:55:09] Galileothe1: its more realstic but its a gtarp server, its a bit awkward
[0:55:09] ArenaKrusher: suddently the crims will start just driving in the middle of the city EZ
[0:55:09] Athasin: I feel like if that's a rule it should be stated clearly in the SOPs otherwise don't punish people for it.
[0:55:12] shawks: where is the RP in restricting the PD so hard? Pd should be feared, not a content mechanic for crims
[0:55:12] SmugPls: the crims now know they just drive safe and EZ call off unless its a robbery LUL

[0:57:30] frailgolem: can cops set up a sting with a G6 car??? like cops pretending to be g6 workers? @uhSnow
[0:57:39] Athasin: What makes it even more unlucky is that he was 14-15 days away from having 4 DAPs removed.
[0:57:40] SmugPls: its also a "safe" area to be pitting
[0:57:41] owlx7: Targeted in Feburary!

[0:59:20] ninjagirl8816: @blugiant uhsBlue uhsBlue uhsVibe
[0:59:43] Athasin: The issue is that the SOPs aren't clear cut, they're actually real vague; "Pit when safe," but what's safe?
[0:59:47] RadiantOrbit: Lapd and bcso
[0:59:56] StephyFace: Little Texas!

[1:00:05] Forser: Athasin, If you ever read Laws, they are vague also
[1:00:14] Metric: when you have mechanics that can be as random as they are in this engine, handing out DAPs like this is only going to punish the most active cops.
[1:00:15] RadiantOrbit: LSPD & BCSO I think
[1:00:24] kiwiiyo: there are many cool ways to punish, i remember when baas had to do bicycle patroll or the city vault / legion square patrol. let them be a traffic cop for a day or some shit SHRUGGERS daps are boring
[1:00:34] StreamElements: There are bots currently going around Twitch whispering you about giveaways. These giveaways are a scam. DO NOT CLICK ANYTHING, just report them to Twitch and block them!

[1:01:36] kiwiiyo: thats what i mean, the dap out of context is okayish but in his situation idk its still a game
[1:01:41] SmugPls: i think daps are fine but like, the punishments barring something egregious and requiring a sort of OOC hand, Should just be like 24 hour suspension at most.
[1:01:41] Galileothe1: should have just taken him along classic
[1:01:43] Forser: Athasin, They are still vague else there wouldn't be really a point of arguement in court

[1:04:20] TheRealStanchez: could the owner screenshot the location on their phone and just text it?
[1:04:20] Athasin: @Forser The SOPs don't have a specific speed for when it's safe to pit, they don't have a specific time (i.e. day vs night) it's okay to pit, and doesn't actually say you can't pit in the city

[2:55:50] Bakemaan: and even those did pretty good.
[2:55:50] Stealthkillah122: Red dead online was a flop xD
[2:55:52] Milo_lul: @mjaaee nahh they hate mod community for some reason
[2:55:58] mjaaee: they usually do really good games, but then they take time
[2:56:01] Synced3D: yea but those were not built by rockstar games.
[2:56:03] Payy_C: that want R*

[2:56:28] mjaaee: YEah its sad that they dont give better tools for mods... they have changed their policies around it. But its like "its okay but dont expect anything from us"

[5:03:19] Shoukaku_ijn: i been skydiving
[5:03:21] robertsmithjr: so my question is do we believe that, that ancient civilization could build the great pyramid between 20 and 27 years, thats a long time, but to think they moved 10ton solid blocks over great distances and then were able to lift them, it is interesting for sure, either something weird happened or they were masters when it came to that type of physics
