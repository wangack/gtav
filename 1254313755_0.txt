[6:55:54] TheRealFolkBlues___: yeah IA is supposed to keep people like Pred and Wrangler in check

[6:56:37] Tuckerbonage: I guess wrangler didn't get the memo that IA has higher power
[6:56:41] Garfi3ld: I mean Carter didnt want to say things because he didn't want strikes lol
[6:56:42] Danglypooters: More personal an people will use it to skip rank on punishment
[6:56:44] moiphies: cops don't like to punish each other because of how it comes back to them

[6:56:55] wondervviener: its guess going to be petty war between high command and IA
[6:56:56] aloofgiant398: should be like an fib thing
[6:56:57] deceived_gear: I feel like officers would be harder on other officers and more likely to hold them accountable
[6:56:58] ka1o5: Wrangler would run circles on a outsider IA
[6:56:59] moiphies: wrangler was already threatening carter's position, telling him to find a different department
[6:56:59] Donkeyshspittle: like if wrangler doesn't like the IA stuff, that's perfect, he shouldn't as someone that's does do stuff off book. that's the fun rp
[6:56:59] GuiltyCarpet: GuiltyCarpet subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! 
[6:57:07] TheGameAssassinGuy: The problem with wrangler is that he likes to be the highest ranking officer all the time.

[6:57:10] Havn1914: would be like throwing a sheep to the wolves
[6:57:10] GuyBieri: @UberHaxorNova I think he's saying that someone should be hired to fill the role. A lot of PDs actually do have civilian IA so that way they're not supposed to be persuade. But obviously this is RP so it makes sense
[6:57:14] mau552: uhnShifty
[6:57:20] ICEsanctuary: you could maybe do retired cops I guess
[6:57:22] tombovard: I think the idea would be that they wouldn't be able to be influenced by rank issues, but as you said that just introduces a bunch of other issues
[6:57:26] PeachSpookums: Good morning chat uhnHug
[6:57:29] crowji: @TheGameAssassinGuy thats literally not true, he fucking hates being responsible for running shit lmao

[6:57:42] ironcladtrain: poor boba, hes hurting, help em
[6:57:42] lord_dragox412: @Tuckerbonage It's Wrangler, he is almost above the law, pushing the line as far as it can stretch before breaking. Top tier RP from Penta LUL
[6:57:46] Swiftym8: doesnt really work in a city where 90% of the city are criminals
[6:57:47] Nightbot: Be sure to hit the 'Follow' button below the video player to be notified when James goes live! uhnHeart
[6:57:49] elleonels: wrangler literally memes about the thin blue line its not like he wouldnt roll with ia trying to punish him
[6:57:49] Danglypooters: Yeah but it doesnt form distrust within the PD it just eats the force from the inside.
[6:57:50] EddieEXP: uhnWiggle uhnWiggle uhnWiggle

[6:57:55] LLYYFFEE: That’s why they need to bring in civilians for jury
[6:57:55] NoManners: the senate should be IA NODDERS
[6:57:57] CensoredTH0ughTs: ia threatens people to change their core rp behaviors and nobody wants to do that
[6:57:58] zoocher_: Make everyone IA NODDERS

[6:57:59] dr_plox: @PronHab_CEO temple

[6:58:00] KoengGaming: just meta game it 4Head
[6:58:00] curioddity: well if Carter punishes Wrangler for IA stuff can't Wrangler just turn around and do some petty shit back to Carter cause he out ranks him?
[6:58:01] NukeDB: anytime you try to check someone with power itll just be met with "Ill do X to you" or "we will see how this goes for your future" like it does IRL tbh
[6:58:03] COPSYCALLUM: uhnWiggle
[6:58:06] CapitalSG: What a funny court case, glad everyone is having a good time
[6:58:07] Kyndagh: @elleonels Hard Kap KEKW
[6:58:08] SsjFourGohan: To be fair isn't that the same if the police officer who is IA isn't on the scene?
[6:58:09] silent_penumbra: poor carter got trowed under the bus by both partys kekw
[6:58:10] 420thMagicMan: People outside PD wouldn’t have the training necessary for IA, maybe if cop mains made IA characters but that wouldn’t make much sense
[6:58:10] NimbleThroatKick: It's pretty impossible to work well as a cop with people you're actively trying to fuck over
[6:58:12] skyyPIE: "random person has no idea about the nuances of the PD and therefore should be investigating us*
[6:58:13] darkecomplex96: Kind of needs to be cops and an honor system kind of thing

[6:58:17] Azhogh: Why nobody farts in the court room ? Sadge
[6:58:18] boomtwack: IA isn't set up correctly. wrangler trying to retaliate against carter would be taking very seriously.
[6:58:19] PronHab_CEO: wait temple?? is he pro cop judge??
[6:58:21] Danglypooters: The same way its happens now the differance is its not someone you have to be around daily
[6:58:23] Ryner_Jager: yeah like this and that
[6:58:23] FlametrowerOP: A lot of times the ia is not there
[6:58:28] LLYYFFEE: Jury jury jury
[6:58:30] GuyBieri: @UberHaxorNova No I completely understand what you're saying. It completely makes sense in this scenerio ex. RP. I've just had a friend that was an IA but yea, in RP it makes no sense to do it
[6:58:39] limbob253: IA should have a specific high command member that only they answer to
[6:58:41] CarolusRex521: The main issue is that if Carter punished Wrangler Wrangler would come back snd find a way to pu is him, making it so Carter doesn't want to do anything to him
[6:58:43] coldskye: Darn, so many essay in chat. LUL
[6:58:44] IchiFi: In this case it's an investigation that has time sensitive evidence in the form of GSR vs IA doing there investigation moon2PAIN Wrangler is always going to consider the evidence as more important
[6:58:45] Sir_Proton: It’s an investigation of police actions, just like how sometimes police investigate things that happen while they weren’t there
[6:58:46] Raedosz: @curioddity he could punish him for things he should be punished for, wrangler ignores all cop fuck ups
[6:58:48] Nightbot: Check out D.R.E.A.M and their clothing! James has partnered with D.R.E.A.M to help support the Mental Health cause and to help you get some nice looking merch in the process. http://dreamsruleme.com/?afmc=1f
[6:58:48] Kyndagh: @PronHab_CEO He's pretty anti-cop, but his rulings are generally relatively unbias
[6:58:50] epitaph6969: Get somebody to rp a police officer from a city, come to Los Santos to do ia here
[6:58:51] aloofgiant398: maybe the ia officer can not be punished by their commanding officer
[6:58:52] tombovard: holy paragraphs uhnGiga
[6:58:53] KingPresiden: tldr chat
[6:58:53] Daliwastaken: Carter did not even get the report taken fully KEKW
[6:58:56] SsjFourGohan: IA is just like HR tbh
[6:58:57] NoManners: @elleonels he's literally being pursued by IA and his first defense is to talk to Pred about firing carter. OMEGALUL
