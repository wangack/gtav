[3:42:30] BadRabbits: he bought it a while back
[3:42:32] RedBeardsActual: he bought it before being told not to
[3:42:33] sBuon: oh
[3:42:36] magnets_: he bought it day 1 as soon as he got the license
[3:42:41] BadRabbits: only got told yesterday he couldn't have it
[3:42:53] ImOome: peepoShrug
[3:42:55] magnets_: the main issue is flaunting it in front of 60 people
[3:42:56] magnets_: imo
[3:42:58] RedBeardsActual: I think its not an excuse but an important factor
[3:43:01] BadRabbits: i mean...it's not a great excuse
[3:43:05] BadRabbits: it's an excuse
[3:43:09] plawpsruby: No that isn't an excuse when he's a recruit
[3:43:10] Gobukiller: Wait, did he have a license? Are there licenses?
[3:43:29] WhosHumble: wait I am confused, he bought it before gun training.. so just bad
[3:44:02] RedBeardsActual: I just gotta say McNulty is such a fun RP character
[3:44:04] JediJacob_: did he have a weapons license before he even became a cop tho?
[3:44:07] amber_bijoux: as soon as he got his pd gun license he went and bought it and hadn’t even finished pd academy yet lol
[3:44:08] RedBeardsActual: fun as hell but a tough dude
[3:44:08] BadRabbits: @WhosHumble he bought the gun as soon as he could, i think?
[3:44:13] skinnylegend000: man more issues during academy than most do their whole cadet phase.
[3:44:34] BadRabbits: she said "a few days prior"
[3:44:37] sBuon: Shruge idk at this point
[3:44:43] JediJacob_: so he had to have gotten during the online portion of academy?
[3:44:46] RedBeardsActual: it was prior to last night when they all wer told not to do that
[3:44:48] plawpsruby: He's not even a ppo and he is causing issues
[3:45:08] VSDuck: yes
[3:45:12] BadRabbits: no bullets though
[3:45:16] ImOome: why would he be giving a license w/o the training?
[3:45:17] johnnyt182: “.2
[3:45:19] JediJacob_: will you and slacks fire him?....
[3:45:23] plawpsruby: And said he got it before day 2 academy
[3:45:27] BadRabbits: yeah not sure that changes much
[3:45:33] VSDuck: "no bullets" isn't the point AAAA
[3:45:34] RedBeardsActual: he did have a "proper" license, again, not an excuse but it is a factor
[3:45:34] WhosHumble: he is just making himself a walking loot box
[3:45:35] johnnyt182: “with no ammunition”
[3:45:42] sBuon: Also was he still claiming to be CEO?
[3:45:54] sBuon: NODDERS
[3:45:57] RedBeardsActual: either way its great RP
[3:46:03] BadRabbits: can you buy clips for the 1911 without a lisence? (i'm genuinely curious)

[6:04:03] DiaBeetusKoby: can we retime out spoon
[6:04:04] sBuon: it's not good

[6:04:45] sBuon: you gonna let Linda slide with the milk and spaghetti but guac not being good is crazy?
[6:04:46] lark_call: I kind of get it the texture of guac is a bit unsettling
[6:04:52] FlameReetardantPanda: @MrHyde81 ..no?
[6:05:00] JediJacob_: @DiaBeetusKoby i can't read. im from cali
[6:05:03] DiaBeetusKoby: she 100% does
[6:05:05] kx07stitch: I used to hate anything that had avocado in it, now I love it
[6:05:06] sBuon: SHE DOES
[6:05:06] Gobukiller: Guac is just too mild of a flavor for me. All it adds is texture, and I don't need that texture too often. I don't like refried beans for the same reason
[6:05:08] SimplyOrt: milk goes with every meal
[6:05:10] WeirdBeardPlays: Right that has to be fake
[6:05:11] DiaBeetusKoby: 100

[6:06:51] DiaBeetusKoby: @PlethoraOfBees a terrible minority
[6:06:51] warmachine89: STRIMMER'S AWAY, post bad food takes
[6:06:58] WeirdBeardPlays: I think there has been only one case of where I would drink a glass of milk with food and thats PB and J but even then it felt wrong so I stopped.
[6:07:03] SimplyOrt: the only ppl who dislike milk are just upset they cant handle it
[6:07:06] CharzyTX: skyline chili
[6:07:07] Gobukiller: @Gobukiller Most of the stuff that gives it flavor is already in the dish. It doesn't ADD any significant flavor
[6:07:09] kaleidoskopeyes: @Despoiler98 oh yeah totes not everyone, moreso that it’s not unheard of
[6:07:14] themanwithanrx7: I'm kinda with spoon on guac.. I'll eat it but I'll take any other dip over it
[6:07:14] WarpIRL: i love milk
[6:07:15] PhantmK: @SimplyOrt NODDERS
[6:07:19] WarpIRL: I just drink mostly water
[6:07:27] warmachine89: @CharzyTX Should stay in Ohio where it belongs
[6:07:35] Kittriss: Beans don't belong in chili, if you have beans in chili you're a coward
[6:07:37] notlittlenerd: a shot glass of apple cider for breakfast.. does not cure ntohing.
[6:07:47] sBuon: @warmachine89 AAAA

[6:07:58] warmachine89: @Kittriss Beans are fine in chili so long as you're not excluding the meat.
[6:08:02] SimplyOrt: BEANS BELONG
[6:08:02] sBuon: this might be the best night you've ever performed Clap way to go chat
[6:08:06] PlethoraOfBees: @Kittriss I kinda also want to ban them
[6:08:07] notlittlenerd: frozen peas are not a snack on a hot day
[6:08:09] warmachine89: (In non-veg/vegan chili anyway)
[6:08:10] PhantmK: @littlenerd000 Neither does a glass of No Pulp OJ
[6:08:11] Gobukiller: @Kittriss The oldest known chili recipes have beans in them. It's personal preference and that's it
[6:08:17] Despoiler98: @Kittriss its ok to be completely wrong
[6:08:20] sBuon: Beans aren't good custyStare
[6:08:20] DiaBeetusKoby: @PlethoraOfBees LETS DOIT

[6:10:06] sBuon: @PhantmK ltcustFlower that's cause we're meant to be
[6:10:17] SimplyOrt: @littlenerd000 lamb brain is actually good dont sleep on it

[6:10:56] notlittlenerd: do peple really eat mung beans?
[6:10:57] kaleidoskopeyes: where my ADHD homies that have a minimum of 3 beverages at a diner for breakfast? for me, it’s  water, coffee, and a rotation of juice (usually orange, cranberry, or apple)
[6:10:58] sadldas: @sBuon wait
[6:10:59] Lunar_Delta: Imagine going to jail because you thought about robbing a bank.
[6:11:09] sBuon: we have to know for the score O Madge
[6:11:20] Kittriss: Custy, beans or no beans in chili?
[6:11:21] Lalgil: they both sent to the hospital
[6:11:25] DiaBeetusKoby: @Lunar_Delta i would probably be lucky
[6:11:25] Lalgil: 3 to 2
[6:11:28] Lalgil: bam
[6:11:30] SimplyOrt: 3???
[6:11:38] sBuon: @Lalgil the wording is needed medical

[6:13:33] dacooter79: real chili doesn’t have beans
[6:13:37] WhosHumble: thats like skyline chilli
[6:13:38] Kittriss: I cannot belive y'all
[6:13:39] warmachine89: Fokka Texas
[6:13:40] SimplyOrt: says toilet brush
[6:13:40] Brewserker: chili without beans? i don't understand the concept
[6:13:44] Chickenplucker26: Beans in chili is a New England thing. Cowboy chili has no beans, usually only tomatoes, peppers, and/or onions
[6:13:46] sBuon: 2-2 wow this is a lot closer than I thought it was gonna be
[6:13:47] sBuon: OOOO
[6:13:49] Gobukiller: I could honestly go either way. The question is: What are you dipping in it/putting it on?
[6:13:49] kx07stitch: if it doesn’t have beans is it really chilli?
[6:13:50] sBuon: GO ON DUTY OOOO
[6:13:50] Sync989: too bad it's your off day

[6:14:20] SimplyOrt: time out
[6:14:30] sBuon: @SimplyOrt quiet down feet lover
[6:14:31] WarpIRL: says the alcoholic
[6:14:32] dacooter79: because chili and beans were separate meals it was only added to chili to be a filler because of cost back in the day
[6:14:37] DiaBeetusKoby: lotta weirdos tonight.. is it a full moon or something?
[6:14:38] sBuon: @WarpIRL AAAA
[6:14:42] DiaBeetusKoby: like what is happening
[6:14:47] warmachine89: Chili spices (heavy on the cumin), stew beef, red beans, corn, green beans, bell peppers, onion, two shots of whiskey.

[6:16:54] Kittriss: skill issue
[6:16:54] notlittlenerd: hehehe..
[6:16:59] DiaBeetusKoby: yea]
[6:17:00] warmachine89: @DiaBeetusKoby I use whiskey because it doesn't thin it out as much. You could technically use a few dabs of aromatic bitters, but that's not as fun.
[6:17:03] Sync989: they're just misunderstood!
[6:17:04] DiaBeetusKoby: dont have kids
[6:17:05] Nightbot: Come join the discord and fill up the ranks! https://discord.gg/PMrxK3F
[6:17:25] themanwithanrx7: who can afford kids anyways
[6:17:28] Lalgil: she's not wrong
[6:17:31] notlittlenerd: serial killer dog..  be interesting
[6:17:34] Lunar_Delta: yeah but a chihuahua isnt going to murder half his graduating class
[6:17:36] DiaBeetusKoby: @warmachine89 yeah i prepare for the beer by keepin it thicker before
[6:17:39] sBuon: you have all the mods and BEES is the best one, like yeah your kids would be assholes
[6:17:39] WhosHumble: how much money have u guys made so far?
[6:17:49] Kittriss: I know that there aren't kids on the server but do people ever rp pregnancy?
[6:17:53] DiaBeetusKoby: @sBuon woah woah woah
[6:18:02] StarDebris91: does Kian have things he spends money on beside food?
[6:18:05] DiaBeetusKoby: all we know after tonight is spoon is the worst mod
[6:18:07] SimplyOrt: yucky
[6:18:09] StarDebris91: and repairs I guess
[6:18:12] drontuffe: wideHUH
[6:18:12] sBuon: @Kittriss it's a nono
[6:18:12] Gobukiller: The ability for alcohol to "cook out" of dishes is grossly overstated. There's booze in that food
[6:18:20] Kittriss: gotcha
[6:18:22] warmachine89: HUHH
[6:18:32] sBuon: @DiaBeetusKoby Bees is the best of us no?
[6:18:34] WarpIRL: KEKW 󠀀
[6:18:35] notlittlenerd: lol
[6:18:36] watermelon3001: HUHH
[6:18:36] Kittriss: HUHH
[6:18:37] ChadThadd: AAAA
[6:18:38] Nightbot: AAAA
[6:18:41] Gobukiller: It just doesn't do much because A: you're usually not adding a lot, and B: you're consuming it with food
[6:18:48] notlittlenerd: least ot a brussel sprout
[6:18:50] DiaBeetusKoby: @sBuon yea but still a weirdo
[6:19:12] sBuon: @DiaBeetusKoby that's my point, if Bees is the best of us, his kids are gonna be weirdos
[6:19:19] Gobukiller: Someone mentioned adding it to their chili
[6:19:34] sBuon: Anyone else notice he was suddenly interested once alcohol was mentioned? custyStare
[6:19:42] Chickenplucker26: I've had jerky made with whiskey and it didn't cook out. You get a buzz from it.
[6:19:46] DiaBeetusKoby: i put beer in it because its not heavily alocoholic
[6:19:52] PhantmK: It's not impossible, alcohol boils before water
[6:19:57] SimplyOrt: @sBuon  AAAA
[6:19:58] Gobukiller: Yeah, but they're from Cincinnati so they don't count Kappa
[6:20:14] VSDuck: Clingy every time
[6:20:16] themanwithanrx7: clingy
[6:20:17] PhantmK: Clingy
[6:20:20] Lunar_Delta: clingy
[6:20:21] Kittriss: clingy
[6:20:25] kx07stitch: clingy
[6:20:25] sBuon: @PlethoraOfBees what is the weirdest overall take you think you have. Like in general not just food
[6:20:27] PhantmK: @VSDuck This one knows
[6:20:29] Lunar_Delta: Jealously is way worse
[6:20:40] DiaBeetusKoby: i hate the word clingy
[6:20:43] VSDuck: @PhantmK AAAA I feel attacked
[6:20:45] Gobukiller: @DiaBeetusKoby Right. SOME of it boils out. But not nearly as much as you might think
[6:20:46] VSDuck: xD
[6:20:52] Lunar_Delta: catJAM
[6:20:54] Kittriss: Jealousy makes serial killers
[6:20:56] PhantmK: @VSDuck Nah, I have just also been there
[6:20:57] Lunar_Delta: dogJAM
[6:21:06] Lunar_Delta: GroupJAM
[6:21:07] PlethoraOfBees: @sBuon I have no idea
[6:21:23] DiaBeetusKoby: @Gobukiller yeah and 1 can of beer in a whole pot of chili isnt enough to do anything to anyone
[6:21:47] VSDuck: @PhantmK I can't do that again, like I'm fine with a little bit of it but oof if it gets to be too much nah we having a real talky talky AAAA
[6:21:49] SimplyOrt: @DiaBeetusKoby well assume a beer is like 5.5 and chili is simmered for an hour MIN and the volume of chili it aint much to be considered
[6:21:56] Kittriss: I'm afraid to ask chat their opinions on gumbo
[6:22:11] Gobukiller: @DiaBeetusKoby Exactly. And like I said, since you're by definition having that alcohol with food, it's even less potent.
[6:22:14] sBuon: @Kittriss most of them will have never had it
[6:22:25] sBuon: @PlethoraOfBees come on, you gotta have one
[6:22:36] PhantmK: @VSDuck I had one that accused me of cheating IN HER DREAMS, she NEVER FORGAVE ME FOR IT WOT
[6:22:36] Kittriss: @sBuon Really?
[6:22:43] PlethoraOfBees: @sBuon Probably, but I don't know what it is right now
[6:22:46] Chickenplucker26: Jealousy causes arguments, clingy doesn't.
[6:22:47] DiaBeetusKoby: 3.2 was the highest beer weve had in oklahoma most of my life up until a couple years back
[6:22:49] Trackel: hey  gamer
[6:22:59] Trackel: WAIT
[6:23:00] sBuon: @Kittriss I would love to try it but I live in the Northeast ain't no one making that over here
[6:23:03] VSDuck: @PhantmK ohhh nooooo that's just rough
[6:23:04] Trackel: CUSTARD BUZZ?
[6:23:11] MrHyde81: @DiaBeetusKoby The alcohol will all cook off anyway
[6:23:16] SimplyOrt: @trackel no its january AAAA
[6:23:16] sBuon: @PlethoraOfBees Saususge I wanna know when you remember
