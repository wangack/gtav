[2:12:01] PsychoJoker: @PsychoJoker Pepega Clap
[2:12:05] Evilzanz: sure but if ur dnd is in a sock or whatnot at a crime scene the crim still have to meet up and explain how it ended up there @EsfandTV

[2:38:55] Archangel3003: I mean she'd be a great addition to the PD as a cop honestly as she's this willing and already knows a lot about PD work
[2:38:56] chmod_R_777: Ruth will not like this... DAP both of you Nerdge
[2:38:57] condor2104: Just hire more cops like the Mayor said,
[2:38:57] FilzG: @LoudPackNoReefa cause she doesnt want to? what do u mean
[2:38:57] LogicWeasel: PD bad at talent management
[2:38:57] enfranchise_: Tell her to apply to academy LETSGO
[2:38:59] SmugPls: It used to be a way to pd but it caused more issues with people just existing and waiting to join pd instead iirc
[2:38:59] PsychoJoker: Her joining laso would actually require laso to be open 4Head
[2:39:02] WildWillie419: just do crime
[2:39:04] lamknot: isnt the pd looking for officers right now lol?
[2:39:06] cheebah710: smokee SmokeTime

[2:39:12] Joongi_: Duncaning She's a Turner but as a portuguese woman
[2:39:12] jadetortoise: LoudPackNoReefa because Dispatch is done a disservice if it is just a stepping stone to getting in to the PD
[2:39:14] Jeremyohno: She'd be good for the LASO
[2:39:15] Nerd: They are looking, but they keep stringing her along
[2:39:17] YEP46: Hire her as your assistant EZ
[2:39:17] thebigshabam: being dispatch blocks you from being PD? thats the dumbest thing ive heard today.

[2:39:18] sterred: Wait, does she know what shes getting into??
[2:39:19] CeoOfBing: @Reuschel The problem with that is that they lose dispatchers fast. That's what happend in the past. Dispatchers would become officers and they role for dispatcher would empty out.
[2:39:21] the_real_jfk: she should definitely talk to slacks too though
[2:39:24] supaiiii: she'll be one hell of an officer

[3:40:47] Nullble: double jep oonly counts after you charge them
[3:40:51] Saggitari0: @CrystalDimension Its pretty much being focused by the same crime
[3:41:01] cheebah710: cohhBongos cohhBongos cohhBongos
[3:41:04] thebigshabam: double jepoardy only applies being convicted for the SAME EXACT crime twice, IRL

[3:45:28] WTFimnothere: I don't understand charges that require multiple crimes can apply double jeopardy. Like you have to not charge them all the times you caught them?
[3:45:28] coldan01: Nakoda wants to be sheriff Kappa

[3:45:55] otterdangerous: lol is that duncan hiding?
[3:46:01] LoudPackNoReefa: @esfandtv the weight of vehicle models is one of the only things that can’t really be changed by devs. without changing the actual car model it’s very difficult to make any significant difference to weight
[3:46:04] jacksmithcje: good on derulo getting the fiurst ego act haha
[3:46:06] Recon_XoX: Duncaning
[3:46:24] MillerThyme: cornwood scared to confront nekoda LUL
[3:46:28] Kaztiell: @coldan01 ruth said in the meeting that nekodas job is only doj stuff, and that mayor office dont handle other pd stuff
[3:46:41] official_fomaster: Has cornwood confronted nekoda yet?
[3:46:48] thebigshabam: its supposed to have the torque but no top end

[3:47:38] Nataweenie: still doing reports lmfao
[3:47:38] sterred: Because shes used to a shit car she doesnt want the new ones to be better? LUL
[3:47:45] bigpoints101: 4wd gets traction, doesn't spin and loose speed
[3:48:00] SilkSoldier: @sterred I was thinking exaclty the same thing, what is her problem? OMEGALAUGHING
[3:48:04] bertacharm: 0-60 of a ford f 150 is quite a bit better than a crown vic
[3:48:05] SteveAdeptus: Wait, did she buy one?
[3:48:11] bertacharm: tbf
[3:48:11] LoudPackNoReefa: @mcknizzle90 saying they can’t adjust the handling of car without altering the 3D components which is 2 separate types of writing
[3:48:15] MoohamedAlii: It's because four wheels drive
[3:48:25] The_Smarticus: The_Smarticus subscribed with Prime. 
[3:48:31] sterred: @SteveAdeptus No, Corndog got some more rentals in
[3:48:38] thebigshabam: IRL the ford the caracara is based off of dominates the cvpi but the taurus should blow both out of the water being twin turbo and awd

[3:49:08] happysquidy69: chat has cornman talked to nekoda
[3:49:13] mcknizzle90: @LoudPackNoReefa Understandable, but these devs could if they should feel they wanted it. Its a balance between RL and RP so thats why I personally think they dont do certain things. It makes for the RP
[3:49:15] sterred: @SteveAdeptus No worries dude! esfandL
[3:49:18] JokersRansom: i think it might be GTA 5

[4:37:01] happylagoon1: talk to nekoda @EsfandTV
[4:37:02] Usahi_Light: sheriff office up there so early in 4.0 shuts down 100% of crime up there same as slacks slowing down crim mechanic investigations
[4:37:02] gardenkiller: hi
[4:37:02] Vildux: @oSam9er because he has "meetings"
[4:37:03] Wetidiot: its crazy that they dont want to open it just to make transport way easier
[4:37:07] Hotdamn_89: Ruth and Nakota I don't think they do

[4:37:14] GrimTek: @GoDLiKe853 huh?
[4:37:16] chibishimaa: do the crims find it odd that no cops are catching them up there tho ?
[4:37:17] DaZooKidd420: That's a -1 "New crime" GTA isn't a new crime 🤔 LUL
[4:37:18] jeffrey778: wonder if nickoda is in cahoots with them bicker fellas
[4:37:20] TimmayHS: Can you tell us what your current plan is? Are you going to speak with Nakoda? @EsfandTV
[4:37:26] ZobeyZobes: @BedlessSleeper unfortunately none of the mechanics work so you can't process etc there
[4:37:27] i_am_jam_: @GoDLiKe853 he would probly watch it if u send during tsunami
[4:37:28] murlock_af: crime is a one way street

[4:37:30] icephrogg: what will you do if cornwood doesnt get elected for sheriff?
[4:37:33] RexPappa: its dumb, even the Mayor wants it, isnt he supposed to be the one that runs this place?
[4:37:37] BedlessSleeper: @BedlessSleeper rip
[4:37:39] SumDee_LumDee: call his snake ass
[4:37:40] Usahi_Light: because its all done in stolen cars, if theres like two or three cops up north no crims can do anything tbh
[4:37:40] Edward_Theodore: hes done
[4:37:41] ManakinEU: @Wetidiot the server has a history of focusing on the city especially the southern part of it

[4:37:46] CrystalDimension: they done
[4:37:46] Wallsh_: call him
[4:37:47] jessielight: I don't think nekota will say to Cornwood what he has been saying to other people.
[4:37:47] puppietreats: @dazookidd420 that’s the most nerd thing ever
[4:37:47] destinygun: He's done
[4:37:48] Connorbrow: @Usahi_Light It wouldn't shut it down completely, it'll just make it more risky
[4:37:48] Gachiguru: o7

[4:38:05] RexPappa: @RexPappa lol
[4:38:05] Beep_Cx: But Cornwood doesn't know he's done talking to Slacks Susge
[4:38:07] AngeloJulius: LUL is dincan still waiting his turn
[4:38:07] That_One_Guy_No_One_Likes: nice meta chat
[4:38:08] InsecureForSure: lookUp
[4:38:09] doutplayd: maybe duncan joined the conversation Duncaning
[4:38:09] CrystalDimension: @frack3r OOOO
[4:38:12] EliasRR_: Clueless
[4:38:13] icephrogg: what will you do if cornwood doesnt get elected for sheriff?
[4:38:14] Usahi_Light: @Connorbrow it would take two to three cops in sandy to make it almost impossible, the risk isnt worth the reward from the crims i watch if theres heavy cop presence
[4:38:16] Zanduin: This would never happen, but what happens if you just stop policing south of 68 entirely
[4:38:17] Edward_Theodore: no he won't
[4:38:19] they_call_me_staceey: We not following that guy from the gas station?
[4:38:19] ManakinEU: @EsfandTV where would you put the sheriffs office? paleto? grapeseed? sandy ?
[4:38:24] Pee_aRe: Make him pay you back $30 if he lies to you
[4:38:41] Pee_aRe: sorry $30k
[4:38:41] slight621: That's like 6 Duncan hours
[4:38:42] SmileyVR: Do you have Detectives who's sole purpose is to gather evidence at the crime scene or are the Police Officers expected to do everything in this server?
[4:38:42] jd2881: Good luck. Duncan been lurking around him since he got on shift. You know that convo atleast and hour.
[4:38:53] Gachiguru: @That_One_Guy_No_One_Likes dentt ALERT
[4:38:54] BigTreav: esfandzooted
[4:38:55] catfish_quackenbush: @icephrogg he already said he doesnt really care about rank, just wants it opened, and he wants to be up there
[4:38:57] Connorbrow: @Connorbrow It takes a while to get from Sandy to Paleto
[4:39:01] RezaD438: who do not want it ? the council ?
[4:39:01] bertacharm: centralized location
[4:39:11] Gachiguru: that aint gonna happen its crimpixel nw
[4:39:11] twilightbaseballscene: agree
[4:39:15] Kerviel_: @RexPappa Yep, but same as how Lenny won CoP in 3.0 but didn't get it. Some people refuse to step down or relinquish power
[4:39:16] Pravolution: What does opening them achieve
[4:39:17] bertacharm: yea
[4:39:18] condor2104: not sure its gonna happen, its upto the captains
[4:39:18] Thunderpint: At last be able to work out of it.
[4:39:21] bertacharm: fair
[4:39:22] Romanowski: Is the screengrab embedded  into NP or is it a sep app?
[4:39:22] rocker22_: slacks said he thinks its at least 2 academys away. he wants 100 cops
[4:39:23] D00Dlles: Fuck it open all 7 pds again xdd
[4:39:27] MDM4ever1986HD: agree
[4:39:28] enfranchise_: @RezaD438 The Captains I think
[4:39:28] thebogeym4n: Yeah, just to be able to process people in those
[4:39:28] Neekapkilla: Slacks says need 100+ officers before you open anything else
[4:39:32] Gachiguru: they cant even process applications you think they gonna open two new offices LMAO
[4:39:34] That_One_Guy_No_One_Likes: @Gachiguru idk what this means but ty i appreciate it
[4:39:36] zigzagg88: Open it give it 10 to 20 workers and u and other police station can work together
[4:39:36] SumDee_LumDee: DUNCAN GETS TO BE PALETO SHERIFF CORNWOOD IS SANDY SHERIFF
[4:39:37] ssurien: not enough cops to open both
[4:39:38] ManakinEU: i think there should be a department that focuses on everything outside city limits with its own style of policing
[4:39:40] oompous: @Romanowski xshare
[4:39:41] EliasRR_: just have the entire city be cops xdd
[4:39:41] StreamElements: 22% OFF YOUR PURCHASE AT GAMERSUPPS.GG when you use code "OTK"! NOW UNTIL 2/9! GET ON NOW, GIT!
[4:39:42] the_bucket_plays: so wait the rangers are coming back now
[4:39:42] srejok: 100+ officers is crazyy
[4:39:44] Usahi_Light: openign more patrols in sandy makes sense but a whole PD up there is overkill with how the mechanicsare rn
[4:39:46] jd2881: You should probably push for that more. Just getting the offices open to process people. Worry about actual sheriff later on.
[4:39:46] the_real_jfk: definitely need to run home the part about just opening the facilities not splitting the department
[4:39:47] SumDee_LumDee: DUNCAN GETS TO BE PALETO SHERIFF CORNWOOD GETS TO BE SANDY SHERIFF
[4:39:54] bbbrabbit123: Chat has he talk to Nekoda yet?
[4:39:54] jessielight: Im just saying Nekota said one thing to Cornwood then we heard what happened at the council. He is a politician.
[4:39:58] zizzzic: @EsfandTV is that huge barn behind you new addition to 4.0?
[4:40:02] TheGodmother: Chatting

[4:40:11] Karter6t: When Max fired all of the captains, everything will change Kappa
[4:40:11] mcknizzle90: how many PD cars are there?
[4:40:12] daltonlowe74: grapeseed would be the best
[4:40:17] ManakinEU: @SumDee_LumDee i wouldnt do that just do one sheriff two buildings
[4:40:21] Usahi_Light: whts blue mean>
[4:40:23] Kerviel_: @Neekapkilla not surprise he would say that as he doesn't want any other departments or divisions
[4:40:23] Renaiira: Council was happy to entertain it if Cornwood compiled crimes up north
[4:40:31] condor2104: Mayor can influence this happening bur he s not the final  say.  If the the captains vote against this its dies
[4:40:32] God_is_a_cat_girl: @EsfandTV when the guy karate chop you, you should've counted how long it took them to reach you, to show how bad it can be
[4:40:34] MDM4ever1986HD: @ssurien unless they recruit more in the academy
[4:40:41] AlexSamaAU: lmao wtf
[4:40:41] nkpyo_: Chat is stuck with what Nekoda did, but the Council doesn't have the power to open the office anyways. The captains do because of the devs.
[4:40:44] Smoogol: Susge
[4:40:45] bertacharm: and htats fucked

[4:40:55] Kindunax: Louise Susge
[4:40:55] Ragestrike: Guys again open the sheriff office you double amount of cops to be hired and double the academies the 100 cops thing is only if sheriff was to split the pd force thats just false
[4:40:55] inducedcatharsis: Can you see who could be doing that?
[4:40:55] UA_Shark: Ruth
[4:40:55] zigzagg88: Need a detective who can looks at reports and finish the one that's aren't closed
[4:40:55] cuspeli: Susge 🐍

[4:40:58] jalvaflow: report
[4:40:58] Amstadam: -1 RP
[4:40:58] Misui: removing BC tag is super sus and really not cool OOC wise
[4:40:59] Vikarious_X: Integriddy
[4:40:59] ItsMadKat: you said slacks was doing it, is he still doing it?
[4:40:59] jifjam: it might be a dev
[4:41:00] Zyphamon: He's only 19 Sadge
[4:41:02] Gachiguru: it has to be an OOC decision
[4:41:02] Toastedgamer03: honestly i think that is worth a complaint in a meeting or to the captains
[4:41:03] GYNECHIATRIST: Susge i blame archer tbh
[4:41:05] Serakkis: That's really messed up ooc
[4:41:07] Smoogol: owo see
[4:41:08] Mallyraws: u gotta learn in character :p
[4:41:08] Berserake: Ruth or Derollo
[4:41:09] they_call_me_staceey: So it's not a bug??
[4:41:09] jy33130: Slacks
[4:41:09] Zendorea: Did IT tell you who @EsfandTV
[4:41:09] Archangel3003: Are you able to find out who???
[4:41:09] TimmayHS: It might be Ruth @EsfandTV

[4:41:17] DDBeatrice: conspiracy? inside job?
[4:41:18] MDM4ever1986HD: Ruth or Archer?
[4:41:20] Connorbrow: @srejok It's also completely arbituary, 100 cops but only 5 on duty at a time is different from 100 cops with 33(.3) per shift. If anything it should be based on typical numbers
[4:41:20] Wintyer2: removing them is falsifying documents and would be a crime would it not
[4:41:23] the_real_jfk: idk he said some sus stuff to slacks
[4:41:24] icephrogg: what will you do if cornwood doesnt get elected for sheriff?
[4:41:24] Zyphamon: who is an officer to question a higher up tbh
[4:41:25] lawlkat: slacks brain broken tbh tho
[4:41:26] Real23Phil: I think it was derollo, no reason just do
[4:41:26] CrystalDimension: @EsfandTV ask OOC then
[4:41:27] TankArcade: Can you see who was the last one that edited the reports?
[4:41:27] MackPlays: He doesnt know what Slacks tells Cornwood, it's hearsay
[4:41:28] UA_Shark: @SarahFlare Daptain Ruth!
[4:41:29] jacksmithcje: yeh i honestly think its aldo
[4:41:31] happylagoon1: phone @EsfandTV
[4:41:33] Usahi_Light: its 100% an OOC thing to not stop petty crime crim stuff
[4:41:35] Fascinated_viewer: sabotage Hmm
[4:41:37] TheyCallMePoki: Corrupt cops Susge
[4:41:37] kylef_: ReallyMad

[4:41:41] RexPappa: MADWOOD
[4:41:43] SmileyVR: That's 100% obstruction of justice
[4:41:44] condor2104: Bro you need to finish your manifest, and fight for this,  Cause its not happing imho
[4:41:45] Zendorea: Lenny is online =)

[4:41:53] rocker22_: slacks also thinks a sheriff or anyone has to go 30 days without DAPS haha cornwood would neeed to lock it down
[4:41:53] ahmedtak5224: can someone tell me what happened

[4:49:36] TimmayHS: Sometimes you talk in circles, but a lot of the time you're very clear @EsfandTV
[4:49:38] smavis: xdd
[4:49:38] AndHaka54: you but with alot ppl u need to more then you are
[4:49:38] icephrogg: slacks is afraid of getting a clown running the sheriffs office so he feels like the pd would go back in 6 months
[4:49:39] Loeffler: Step brother
[4:49:40] goChloro: people are just misunderstanding I think
[4:49:40] Kaiyo_exe: You are very unclear in your speech
[4:49:41] condor2104: Finish your manifesto
[4:49:44] georgiaassasin: your 100% clear5
[4:49:44] BadRabbits: so the RP talk of talking about IRL
[4:49:44] Entropystachio: you just explained yourself in two sentences, what isn't clear?
[4:49:46] eliteone11: I think you just tell everyone about it, so people think you just want the power of being a Sherrif
[4:49:50] Karter6t: First you started as a start a new department which is what everyone still thinks is going on
[4:49:54] judge_hat: wow backseaters
[4:49:55] MHOPjr: monkaW
[4:49:55] fixer_18: Maybe have devs look into it because this is some weird bath faith banable sabotaging
[4:49:55] Sibrav: @EsfandTV ride with jimbo after slacks and nekoda
[4:49:57] the_schlan: Bring the tags up to Slacks. The tegrity of the PD is at stake. Be political with it.    Or it coulld be a legit IT thing, either way, an admin/cap should know
[4:49:58] mcknizzle90: Fuck yeah Lenny, goes into the room to Salute the flag, true person
[4:49:58] Percolatorx: Its because the captains are afraid of losing power and controll. It has nothing to do with the logistics of the game. 󠀀
[4:50:00] cheebah710: cohhDink cohhDink cohhDink
[4:50:00] SharkzGG_: Everyone thinks at first you want a split instead of just opening the doors
[4:50:01] Smoogol: you never made the case for the building. the points you presented were about crime and culture
[4:50:01] RexPappa: Maybe some key people dont want you as Sheriff yet? Cuz thats the natural thing to happen once they open the office
[4:50:06] PimicTV: Double speak comes from the book 1984
[4:50:07] memequeen_ellie: @esfandtv why don't you guys do hand over notes at shift change like on paper
[4:50:08] McKibbo: to me it seems like everyone just sees you as wanting the sheriffs office open and thats all
[4:50:09] ManakinEU: @Connorbrow thats what they had for most of 3.0 until they changed things iirc
[4:50:09] Tiabbz: people think you just want to be Sheriff i believe
[4:50:12] the_bucket_plays: since you said that the stations should be open just out of convieniance then it would be but they think ur talking opening and staffing
[4:50:12] Kaiyo_exe: I think your HDMI effects you when you try to convey your thoughts
[4:50:13] mutagen_ooze: sounds like everyone is against it. why else did he act like he wasn’t suppose to hear that
[4:50:15] gazzeh0: is there not a system in place to see who has been editing the reports?
[4:50:18] Insaneoptimus: @EsfandTV LASO should only have SUV, Truck and vet
[4:50:19] Wiipotato: Could add you want the offices open as operational bases as an extension for the LSPD.
[4:50:20] Spearrow: At first it sounds like opening it to be fully operational and not just opening the building for utility purposes.
[4:50:23] GnolRevilo: OTK UltraMad
[4:50:24] KreamyKeeny: do you think angryginge has good rp
[4:50:27] steempunker211: monkaSteer

[4:50:29] nixk490: did local ai get better?
[4:50:30] steempunker211: monkaSTEER
[4:50:32] amavadin: Look at Cornwood controlling locals like an expert
[4:50:33] lawlkat: priority should be communicating with Koda and slacks @EsfandTV
[4:50:33] CrystalDimension: @EsfandTV in 3.0 Sheriff's ofice got opened like a year into the server , no ?
[4:50:33] iBubaloo: FirstTimeChatter
[4:50:33] TheGodmother: kekw
[4:50:34] EPiQ: its been portrayed for weeks as you dont want to operate under the captains because they're messing things up, so the LASO should solved that
[4:50:36] Vallhan: ReallyMad
[4:50:39] nostalgia_cube: Phrasing it as "building the infrastructure of the current PD" might go better
[4:50:40] str8chevychasin: B. B

[4:50:50] Aphotice: i think you just gotta simplify what your reason is for opening.
[4:50:51] LoganChance: I think the explanations should take two minutes flat. I feel like the longer the convo goes on the more likely the person you’re talking to just starts making things up in their heads @esfandtv
[4:50:54] Sibrav: oh shit hit 140
[4:50:56] BadRabbits: Local AI isn't reacting to your lights
[4:50:58] SarahFlare: @gazzeh0 I think "IT" was looking to potentially add a "last edited by" or something like that.
[4:50:58] AndHaka54: @EsfandTV i think the problem is most LSPD sees that yall always under staffed, so they think its impossible to open the sheriffs office just yet
[4:50:58] lzrdwzrdtv: 3Heading
[4:50:59] mininni94: @EsfandTV McConnell said he's tried hard to get you onto Onx. Give it a chance

See, normally if you go one on one with another captain, you got a 50/50 chance of winning. But I’m a genetic freak and I’m not normal! So you got a 25%, AT BEST, at beat me. Then you add Ruby York to the mix, your chances of winning drastic go down

[6:26:58] ShadowedSeraphim: Technically the council had to sign off on it because the PD won't be able to afford to open them
[6:27:00] Acebravo_nz: @quaylewastaken 100% I don’t think he doesn’t want it yet due to the fact of officers
[6:27:05] Landoram: 700 applicants, 30 PD, 2 patrol
[6:27:09] TimmayHS: 3 hours.... then says PD doesn't have enough people
[6:27:09] Pandrax86: oh man. interesting situation this is all in
[6:27:11] Seetherrr: @raven1022 he didn't bring up anything at the mayor meeting, mayor had to bring it up himself after 3hrs of being in meeting

[6:27:20] SmugPls: @raven1022 hes playing both sides and being agreeable to both sides. While maintaining just the Captains POV to the council essentially
[6:27:20] LoudPackNoReefa: is this nekoda? I thought the liaison wasn’t a cop?
[6:27:20] Vexamas: @enfranchise_ Because it sounds like the council is legislators that are stakeholders from the places that *should* be making the changes, like head of PD, head of DoJ, head of business (mayor), etc
[6:27:22] realitywolfdog: Just open it
[6:27:25] workwerk: Why did he vote no then?
[6:27:28] RobRoads: If you have 10 per shift sweet. or 5-7 3rd sweet
