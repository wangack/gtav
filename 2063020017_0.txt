[2:35:58] VersaceFlexGod: think crim just not making a lot of money is a big issue
[2:36:03] Julian: I'm still playing catch up too
[2:36:18] AimlessNonsense: But Dez should have that money convo. they need to respect the authoritay
[2:36:20] XI_Velo: I’m taking a shit rn just in case anyone was wondering
[2:36:24] Celascion: GPUs right now are a money sink imo. Crime really doesn't pay is the problem
[2:36:29] plasticmonk: basically you don’t wanna make moves to put you in reverse
[2:36:48] Julian: I tried to convince them to run sani cus its just insane right now but no one wanted to
[2:36:56] khadka9860: u have to be around people to get involved and progress
[2:37:01] eeveejayy: the game is set up for fun vs progress currently and besties are a for fun crew
[2:37:03] Julian: we need boards BAD, 12 butcoin a day is crazy slow
[2:37:05] oDelilah: mhm
[2:37:06] enar_ixo: There's no ic reason to invest in besties. It literally looks like a scam atp
[2:37:08] vourbs: Juju did yoy not get into the server
[2:37:09] AimlessNonsense: Hell yes
[2:37:10] LeTrash_: 87 more days
[2:37:13] TwoTokensOneBlue_: i dont know ehy you gave that much its crazy
[2:37:13] Julian: nah @vourbs
[2:37:18] vourbs: gravCry
[2:37:27] AimlessNonsense: I thought it was only half that damn
[2:37:29] rawhga: yeah 90k towards the car really hurt progress
[2:37:35] Celascion: none of the besties are intersted in doing sani, aside from AK and Dickhead/lovemore
[2:37:36] Volt0: problem with starting sani without someone in the group with more than 100 rep is no recyclables and just demotivates people

[2:37:47] Volt0: or was it 50
[2:37:49] Volt0: i cant remember
[2:38:18] khadka9860: only ming and fanny
[2:38:30] Julian: the 100k should've gone into GPUs imo, it would've paid out so much now
[2:38:31] eeveejayy: for every money run ming and fanny do they could do a hunting run and make 10x the money
[2:38:47] Julian: the slingshot for when you purchase GPUs and once they turn to profit is crazy
[2:38:54] Julian: once you get it pumping
[2:39:06] Julian: marty was so smart for being so early
[2:39:18] LeTrash_: and circuit boards were like 5 per when the loan happened
[2:39:25] ValuableBoring: mhm
[2:39:26] enar_ixo: Yeah, living within means
[2:39:31] Julian: i didnt even think of that @LeTrash_
[2:39:39] haha_been: lmao how much has ming and fanny paid u back
[2:39:53] Celascion: at least AK and 4head managed to get some circuit boards for under 7 per before the recent spike
[2:39:53] zexx0: @Julian they all bought cars with the money right?
[2:40:02] ModelWrong: With AK not around there is a definite lack of focus on how to make money.
[2:40:08] legendaryleeethesad: fanny off for 3 days so make sure to get 4k next payment NODDERS
[2:40:16] llballsweatll: guess a cool car was more important
[2:40:28] SpitFireNW: 90 day loan is crazy tbh haha
[2:40:48] oDelilah: @modelwrong is Nidas away rn?
[2:40:56] haha_been: he sick
[2:41:03] ModelWrong: @oDelilah yeah, he's sick
[2:41:05] VersaceFlexGod: nidas has been playing the new sod wow season and is sick
[2:41:18] oDelilah: aw gravCry
[2:41:25] ModelWrong: yup, me too
[2:41:45] Celascion: @llballsweatll it's not that it was more important, but that the group themselves were unaware how behind they were in terms of butcoin production until it was too late. Also lack of clear leadership
[2:41:47] 90honeydew: and it’s only going to get more expensive because eventually those gpus are going to expire
[2:41:50] MikeNotSoGreat: how you liking civ life?
[2:42:05] haha_been: omieE once the casino opens money gonna be flowing in
[2:42:35] haha_been: PagBounce  im exited for casino rp ngl
[2:42:39] Celascion: marty's casino could unlock so much RP for everyone. Really hope it works out
[2:43:06] VersaceFlexGod: just sucks that what they enjoy doing doesnt pay out and its fine just bad in terms of "progression"
[2:43:07] DaleEarnfartJr: mhm
[2:43:09] haha_been: yeah
[2:43:17] Celascion: True. Gamba with virtual money is always fun
[2:43:18] eeveejayy: no point in a casino when the city is broke
[2:43:18] haha_been: websites also almost done mhm
[2:43:22] MikeNotSoGreat: do you miss criminal stuff? or just waiting for more things to come out?
[2:43:26] LeTrash_: I'm sad he has gone the website route but Im probably not seeing the big picture
[2:44:01] haha_been: yeah i seen it
[2:44:11] Celascion: they still have to place money in game, which makes it feel real
[2:44:17] vourbs: Marty is really good at budgeting money
[2:44:17] eeveejayy: did X get him a kick deal and the site will be run by stake
[2:44:21] MikeNotSoGreat: i remember arma casino dealing black jack while cooking meth at the same time..
[2:44:21] haha_been: it got rep for dealers and costomers too
[2:44:24] askari001: he also made it so its optional to even visit the site, dealer can do it for player
[2:45:00] MikeNotSoGreat: do you remember the arma meth tables?
[2:45:03] MikeNotSoGreat: they would blow up
[2:45:09] MikeNotSoGreat: perfect black jack table
[2:45:33] vourbs: Would the rep for the dealers be something like an increase in pay or something
[2:45:37] MikeNotSoGreat: i would deal 4-5 hands while cooking.. trying to see if i could cook a good batch or blow everyone up.. fun times

[3:00:13] homming: wait only fanny ming (+ julian?) paid towards the power bill?
[3:00:28] PantherVlll: definitely ak OMEGALULiguess but if you ask 4head everyone is useless
[3:00:45] LluagorED: @homming 4head did, Fanny was supposed to send him money from his dirty money.
[3:00:59] somebadtiming: they dont want money
[3:01:17] eeveejayy: hazel is young dez
[3:01:37] iKickMyself: tbf 1k a day is still 30k a month
[3:01:57] compagalan: Is it meta to suggest a tenant for the house?
[3:02:26] iKickMyself: lol
[3:02:29] oDelilah: LUL
[3:02:59] mahtamsam: who would want to rent just to rent tho Hmmm might be hard to find that
[3:03:25] DariusTheYeti: itll be rent + power bill
[3:03:33] eeveejayy: the rental price just has to be cheap enough that it's worth it but high enough to be worth the return
[3:03:33] walzih: Dez gonna be a slumlord?
[3:03:54] iKickMyself: rent to own vs putting it up for sale? for like 220-230k?
[3:04:33] weird_squirrel_: thats 60K in 12 week is that good?
[3:04:36] LluagorED: You got to mark it up higher, because you will also be paying the power bill until they get the full title.
[3:05:20] LluagorED: Mr K kind of got screwed because he hadnt factored that in.
[3:05:24] Moonamy: Mr K makes his tenants pay utilities
[3:05:31] eeveejayy: the power bill will be 25% of the last one, they set it way too high for the first one
[3:05:43] iKickMyself: was the power bill a lot on the rentals?
[3:05:47] weird_squirrel_: no 240K house and u r selling fr 300K so 60K in the time they pay up ryt
[3:05:52] LluagorED: @Moonamy ah, was he able to fix that?
[3:05:53] enar_ixo: @weird_squirrel_ considering he lost 90k in 1 day while being promised at least 45k returned in 1 day, its pretty bad
[3:06:03] akaFRANCOx: how much was the power bill, i missed that completely
[3:06:18] legendaryleeethesad: WICKED
[3:06:42] iKickMyself: LOL
[3:06:42] oDelilah: OMEGALUL

[3:06:53] weird_squirrel_: oh kk
[3:06:58] Moonamy: @RecurveTV he's left the whole rental stuff for now, waiting for next coucil meeting so he can personally explain his contracts etc, since the foo foo'd it cuz they got 3rd hand info :\
[3:07:11] LuxxieNL: Poor Azazel losing his job again
[3:08:08] Moonamy: yeah you can make a fat profit off that house

[3:08:18] LeTrash_: end up losing money on the house because bills OMEGALUL
[3:08:32] iKickMyself: just a waiting game to reach 300k and what you do in the meantime with it
[3:08:38] enar_ixo: @weird_squirrel_ yeah literally scammed by his roommates LUL
[3:09:18] Prepper_Jack: house prices go up the more homes sell in a given area. Problem is for south side, home prices are reaching levels of other areas with nicer homes
[3:09:23] Moonamy: everytime a house in that section is sold, all property goes up 10% I think
[3:09:27] mahtamsam: what if u make them pay utilities
[3:09:32] mahtamsam: yea
[3:09:45] Moonamy: for sure make them pay the utilities
[3:10:13] llballsweatll: civs would be the play they currently make the most
[3:11:27] mahtamsam: do they want rent to own? or normal renting
[3:11:39] LeTrash_: rent it out to sani workers for 3000 circuit boards per month LULW
