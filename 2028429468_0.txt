[2:48:41] Isen_Mage: classic chat
[2:48:42] neonishere32: I only mine diamonds
[2:48:47] N1xSet: i think chat is thinking about transfering from one harddrive to another harddrive rather than from the harddrive to the computer.
[2:48:48] infamous_butcher: The top number is ram storage. The small lower number is on the hdd
[2:48:48] fur3x: why would crypto be stored in ram KEKW
[2:48:49] Numtjok: There is no point to having the wallet if option if it doesnt work like Kylie says.

[2:49:38] XxGazzaGazxX: ha ha
[2:49:40] rmcgowan: Chat seems to not understand that the miner isn't married to the hard drive. All it does is deposit the ButC into the storage drive. You can swap drives because it's just a wallet. It just holds currency
[2:49:40] Batu__17: notee ok but is butcoin going to the moon? 🚀 🌕

[2:49:56] NeoDeci: waiting for fires KEKW
[2:49:56] Mugivord: I think chat forgets this isn't real life and things don't work the same way in game as real life
[2:49:58] klugklug: maybew the fans use a lot of power?
[2:50:02] prozorftw: well time to test the limit KEKW

[3:34:05] cyrusfrog91: dentt
[3:34:06] kingcloudii: not just wrong but stupid and wrong KEKW
[3:34:06] KewlKittyProductions: people don't know how to do basic math lol
[3:34:07] Vadoctrax: dentt
[3:34:08] Seanisms: Yeah but makoto and the rest of the soldiers seem dedicated to the cause itself
[3:34:13] Bro_JaB: judyy chattter
[3:34:16] zippybln2: 14$ vs 30$ = most of the profit dankCrayon
[3:34:21] FriskiestSpoon: TIL 14 is greater than 30
[3:34:23] Rex__84: @Qyuyu you realize mechanics get twice the cut she does
[3:34:35] Darkri19: it also gives makoto the option to negotiate if not happy with the cost ^
[3:34:39] candorus: also, no, she doesn't get the majority of the money...the mechanics get the majority of the money per part @Qyuyu
[3:34:45] doccthunder: TIL im younger now in my 20s then i was a 14 because 14 is more than 30
[3:34:57] flumsen_: someone explain that guy the difference of quantity and profit
[3:34:58] ytu118: because you sell it for $70 and mechanics only get $30 dentt
[3:35:02] mugcostanza: ye
[3:35:07] kaylersss: Guy forgot that volume doesn't matter on profit per part
[3:35:27] f4p__l0rd: It simple math you will make 44 instead of 14
[3:35:28] comfycathie: is Mary going to sell parts to Dundee?
[3:35:35] Seanisms: So does that mean only supplying parts to people who are associated with KC etc?
[3:35:35] candorus: also, it the real world that number would always be flipped...the workers normally make the small amount

[3:35:49] DDingoz: it also make sense for Mary to get money out of it since shes the one who buys the mats
[3:35:54] Qyuyu: Rex__84 candorus she gets profit on EACH sale, mechanics only on the parts they buy from her. if you were to say mechanics as a whole make 30 per part and her 14 that'd be accurate but mechanics are like 3 or 4. basic math

[3:36:49] mugcostanza: kyliebHmm
[3:36:58] candorus: @Qyuyu so?!? Did the mechanics invest over 100k to get the ability to manufacture parts? or get all of the contracts set up to even get all the business?
