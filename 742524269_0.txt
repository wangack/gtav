[2:13:52] Grimm420: @UberHaxorNova could check out the fishing spot on the river south-ish from the winery

[2:14:56] ForeheadSkin: @Keg123 just plug your nose habitually during waking life and ask yourself if you‚Äôre in a dream. The habit should transfer to dreams and you‚Äôll notice you can breathe thru your plugged nose in dreamland. Should work over time :)

[6:12:19] TheRarePotato: oh no
[6:12:19] SirPenguin911: heyo @dinoPharaoh uhnH
[6:12:20] Panzymage: I think bc the 911 call said the car was suspicious it gave the cops incentive to check the car after pulling them over
[6:12:20] leightones: no clips until the situation is over
[6:12:21] 80b101: Stolen Phone and Stolen Radio is probably the only strong evidence
[6:12:24] kura1kura: Pepega ITS TOO MUCH!

[6:12:26] cassdoodles: its not its just bad luck KEKW
[6:12:27] buddha_hands: getting an "anonymous local call" like that I think would signal to most cops to jump on w/e the RP is immediately haha

[6:12:33] boeiee: @Panzymage nah there was more to it
[6:12:35] xRomaine: It's not too much it's up to the people transporting the product not to get caught they chose to go down the main highway cmon chat
[6:12:35] TrekkG: LOLOL @UberHaxorNova Imagine if you didn't switch cars and got pulled over instead
[6:12:36] rat_patuty: Chats gross

[6:12:37] leathercelt: you got to put them through the gauntlet

[6:12:37] moiphies: chat it's ok if cops win
[6:12:38] l_pomegranate: with the amount of times you haven't gotten a 911 response, plates are kinda needed KEKW
[6:12:39] Devon4493: 100% needs to be chance to get caught
[6:12:42] ManUtdF4L: @minxylou SeemsGood
[6:12:43] MountDiabloTV: THIS IS BRILLIANT I LOVE IT SO MUCH KEEP IT UP
[6:12:43] KFC_LUVR_420: i think Its a good test
[6:12:44] SUP3RS0L: They also asked for specifics anyway.
[6:12:46] raisinpuff55: yeah but cops aren't gonna play it off like that they will immediately check the trunk of that shit
[6:12:46] J0ex117: it's not too much
[6:12:48] Freeing_My_Mind: If they had just stopped, for the cop car instead of driving xD
[6:12:52] MeiYap: Yeah i think it's really just bad luck
[6:12:52] Piki9: I think it was just unlucky that cops had nothing going on atm
[6:12:54] ashchuri: thats true LUL
[6:12:54] Phoenix_Feather01: !uptime
[6:12:55] Nightbot: UberHaxorNova has been live for 6 hours 13 minutes 14 seconds
[6:12:55] josh0093: check Pengwin's stream now, chat
[6:12:55] Arkdaim: Were they forced to follow that highway? Or they just had to get to the destination and nothing else? Because if you have that much stuff on you, using less traveled roads would be smarter.
[6:12:56] ACChillin: i actually think you didnt give enough info should have given discription of who was in the car
[6:12:57] SirPenguin911: LUL
[6:13:00] Lamemo: it will give the drivers room to wiggle
[6:13:01] sigmadelta01: just curious do they have to follow the gps exactly to the destination b?
[6:13:03] Tsorer: @josh0093 no
[6:13:03] Dierseus9: itll be interesting to see this go t court
[6:13:03] Lunesta777: There are different ways into the city they decided to go the highway
[6:13:06] DudleyIsDumb: Yeah the issue was they did a felony stop instead of a regular stop and that‚Äôs it @uberhaxornova
[6:13:06] TheRarePotato: it's a high risk operation for a reason
[6:13:06] epic_smee: i dont understand how you are supposed to get out of that situation. car is stolen . slow as fuck KEKW
[6:13:06] MinxyLou: @manutdf4l All good. post it later dude uhnH
[6:13:08] tombovard: @UberHaxorNova I winder tho if this means that now every time they get one of those calls they're going to do a search of the vehicle uhnThonk
[6:13:10] wavothan: im waiting for people to find out ooc about this and decline every call KEKW
[6:13:10] tombovard: wonder*
[6:13:11] MisterNeckTwist: Guys sometimes it gets a lil spicy its okay just let it ride
[6:13:17] Boogihead: CHAT. They also didn't have to go down the main god damn highway. SHHHH CHAT. Many variables.
[6:13:22] alex_sawasdee: Pengwin‚Äôs so confused rn KEKW
[6:13:24] raisinpuff55: like you are setting up for them to get caught, felony stop after felony stop
[6:13:29] TheRarePotato: and the guys can snitch all they want now too
[6:13:30] kura1kura: they could have drove offroad
[6:13:33] epic_smee: @Boogihead there is only one road.
[6:13:33] syneesia: They sshoulldve changed routes, they live and learn KEKW
[6:13:34] double00boo: if it was a legal car i dont think the plates would have been too much, but when its not their car they get stopped for the anon call and then they are in a stolen car when they check plates
[6:13:34] mikey_2: Almost like it‚Äôs the whole point to have some type of heat
[6:13:36] sigmadelta01: yeah then its on them if they get caught
[6:13:39] Nerozkii: think they were following the ping
[6:13:41] raisinpuff55: but I guess they could've drove offroad
[6:13:44] TheModernMeta: If they saw you called it in do the cops go auto hard mode on the car reported?
[6:13:45] MrYiff: time to setup a jailbreak for these guys when they get transported?
[6:13:50] Boogihead: @epic_smee There are so many ways into the city.
[6:13:51] ManUtdF4L: @minxylou Gotcha!
[6:13:51] Lamemo: NODDERS
[6:13:51] buddha_hands: they prob would've followed the route perfectly due to the intimidation haha
[6:13:52] Nomnomperson: they just followed the gps line, which was perfect because it led them right by the cops KEKW This couldn't of gone any better
[6:13:56] Utynex: yeah he took the other route first but then someone was " I don't wanna meta but I think he wants you to go the other way " @uberhaxornova
