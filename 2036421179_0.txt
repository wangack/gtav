[3:48:45] Fossabot: the PMBU, or the professional make believe union is union consisting of GTA RP streamers under 1000 viewers. The union dictates that streamers over 1000 viewers shall shout out the smaller roleplayer 5 times, as well as gift 100 subs to the streamer in order for them to be interacted with. Lastly, they will need to raid you at the end of stream.This applies to ever time that the smaller streamer is interacted with. Contact @KristoferYee to join the union.

[4:21:04] Fossabot: the PMBU, or the professional make believe union is union consisting of GTA RP streamers under 1000 viewers. The union dictates that streamers over 1000 viewers shall shout out the smaller roleplayer 5 times, as well as gift 100 subs to the streamer in order for them to be interacted with. Lastly, they will need to raid you at the end of stream.This applies to ever time that the smaller streamer is interacted with. Contact @KristoferYee to join the union.

[4:50:46] RogueBear: Ka Chao is definitely not a vigilante type
[4:50:46] XCII_Caelus: Ka tries batman voice om
[4:50:49] ShadowDeathStrike: Ka Chow is Batman
[4:50:50] aproxrambo: YEP

[4:51:01] DetectiveTato: ka to crime time LUL

[4:51:55] sxnchez: @aktrigamax17 scrajj weed run went wrong iirc?
[4:51:58] Xethra: Rhodes had a get together with a large number of old PD, and many of them are getting the same treatment its not just you
[4:52:04] mrjeagerjackes: They said no to Snow... It's not personal
[4:52:06] Clodhoppr: they needa keep adding to each shift, just make presence with him known and keep ppl laughing, they can't ignore it forever
[4:52:10] XCII_Caelus: jsut speculating, could be because Ka was under Kyle
[4:52:10] sxnchez: damn
[4:52:14] miketwng: @KristoferYee ooc are you aware of jack ripley's arc
[4:52:15] anoobmove_twitch: Just as FYI Ridley didn't get accepted as well and joined the clowns
[4:52:16] AsianStyle86: yeah. they have over 400+ applications
[4:52:17] Grallus: There are lot of cops in the same boat right now

[4:52:37] rien_d: yeah, not even jenny hall or devine?
[4:52:45] AivHell: YEP Ripley became a clown
[4:52:46] aproxrambo: yeeShrug they said "serious cops only"
[4:52:47] itzyoumanz: probaly cause it was a shit show towards the end of 3.0
[4:52:47] LightKensei: Ziggy is a good example...
[4:52:52] mcDeRose: alowo
[4:52:53] DetectiveTato: why do they want all cops to make new characters? that's just silly
[4:52:56] rubberdebugger: ALO
[4:52:58] JetpackDuck: @rien_d They both quit PD
[4:52:58] Tek_munk: peepoFish
[4:52:58] StreamElements: 💀 uhoh - you have 1 💀s
[4:52:59] Na1tsLoL: i guess its up to the captains idk
[4:53:00] dapyman: Professor Bubbles
[4:53:00] muffinplaysgames: Anyone got POV on the cops?
[4:53:05] rhansen2323: ka should pretend to be a cop and race to crime scenes randomly
[4:53:06] Stargazeio: Fishinge
[4:53:06] StreamElements: 💀 uhoh - you have 45 💀s
[4:53:08] Stargazeio: donkMiner
[4:53:08] StreamElements: 🪨 Try again later!
[4:53:11] OutNinjad: i'm pretty sure they're just not allowing previous cop characters back in, they are allowing cop players to make a new cop though
[4:53:11] muffinplaysgames: for this investigation?
[4:53:15] aproxrambo: !time
[4:53:15] Fossabot: @aproxrambo, The time for Kris is 03:54:37 PM (PST)
[4:53:17] mcDeRose: assuming they send you prison before irl food
[4:53:19] miketwng: there was no answer at all to former PD occifers, it's like the LSPD is your ex-gf now
[4:53:22] Bornit: fishh
[4:53:22] StreamElements: No luck, @Bornit NoFishes
[4:53:27] Clodhoppr: @Na1tsLoL i think its above captains ooc
[4:53:30] killadave: @muffinplaysgames deansocool is one of them
[4:53:39] sxnchez: Sadding not even the cops wanna hang
[4:53:39] muffinplaysgames: @muffinplaysgames thankies
[4:53:41] warnivea: From the captains meetings I watched they said that they dont want all the old PD back again,
[4:54:01] warnivea: I dont know
[4:54:10] rubberdebugger: good question
[4:54:15] OutNinjad: they mean the character not the streamer im pretty sure
[4:54:15] miketwng: because well captains have favorites too
[4:54:17] dontbeshellfish: uhSnow got denied for Snow, but got hired with a new character Shrug
[4:54:20] TheCombatantWombat: They don't want cops to be too op. So they're only slowly adding people in
[4:54:21] Bryguy_eH: @muffinplaysgames sgtapollo is Officer Aziz
[4:54:25] aproxrambo: jay que sings "Lonely" by bobby vinton
[4:54:27] AnArousedHippo: how goes it cutie
[4:54:28] mcDeRose: it would be helpful if they made a post somewhere about this. seems like a bunch of folks are confused
[4:54:28] xsilas43: weird to not say anything in rp about it for sure, deny the app so they know
[4:54:28] 4nought: because they still need some experienced to keep it running of course
[4:54:32] warnivea: thats what they talk, saying the
[4:54:41] 4nought: @mcderose yup
[4:54:46] Ergastulums: peepoHey Austin
[4:54:47] ShadowDeathStrike: Tell me whyyy
[4:54:48] DruminDriver: Just walk into a PD meeting with Ka Chao and see how long it takes for them to notice
[4:54:48] AsianStyle86: does getting in the PD gives u Prio WL?
[4:54:52] xsilas43: i think they just want new chars
[4:54:53] itzyoumanz: i been watching cops a bit, they are bein very strict atm
[4:54:53] sxnchez: om wait so this isnt in some nopixel streamer discord?
[4:54:56] sxnchez: thats just dumb af
[4:55:01] ShadowDeathStrike: Aint nothing but a heartache
[4:55:11] Bryguy_eH: Their way of communicating is just off putting
[4:55:18] DetectiveTato: yeah even just a notice would be better than donowalling people
[4:55:18] aproxrambo: "serious cops only"
[4:55:20] sandeep_bs: Did Jay get caught BCS of weed run ?
[4:55:21] rien_d: aint nothing but a mistake
[4:55:23] aproxrambo: AlienDance
[4:55:25] Clodhoppr: like Esfand said, you may just need to make a fresh officer to get back in
[4:55:30] Ergastulums: YEP sandeep
[4:55:33] Chilledous: SURELY they wouldn't virtually nerf cops to make crims enjoy everything without restriction Clueless
[4:55:39] itzyoumanz: even cornwood almost lost his job a few times now from messing around
[4:55:47] miketwng: @KristoferYee try applying using your female char
[4:55:51] anoobmove_twitch: Hiring Mizkif and the green haird chick should of been a slap in the face lol
[4:55:54] xsilas43: Sadge

[4:56:20] RAFO108: https://clips.twitch.tv/BusyRacySwordPoooound-wHH18DZ6C1SM8En3 @KristoferYee since the cop aint coming, its nothing meta but his lawyer was so funny  om
[4:56:25] Hypnovile: Sadge
[4:56:26] ZigSithExarKun: BLUBBERS
[4:56:28] SpellCooldown: so they want deadpool to lay cop
[4:56:29] ShadowDeathStrike: Doctor RP
[4:56:30] f0dder1024: @anoobmove_twitch those were diversity hires
[4:56:37] KittoKin_: but having large amount of cops means getting chased by 5+ cars constantly. which gives a hard time to the crims which is not fun.
[4:56:42] XCII_Caelus: @RaFo108 om
[4:56:46] mcDeRose: Can i just say what everyone is thinking? This is an OOC issue and has nothing to do with rp
[4:56:48] RAFO108: sorry
[4:56:49] RAFO108: kk
[4:56:50] Capablist: from my viewer pov, it seems has to do with the cops that went to onx.
[4:57:14] XCII_Caelus: my headcanon is it has to do with the ONX split Hmm
[4:57:18] miketwng: @Capablist nah no shot thats the reason
[4:57:18] DetectiveTato: @mcDeRose agreed they ain't sayin somethin and it's fishy
[4:57:24] sxnchez: Shrug somedays you need to be a babybacked bitch
[4:57:28] anoobmove_twitch: @f0dder1024 They must have been but they need real PD. They are getting out numbered bad
[4:57:33] FreedomSock: You're Ok Kris
[4:57:33] GoldGuardianX: @kittokin_ SoPs can stop that, chases can be limited
[4:57:37] aproxrambo: NODDERS what sxnchez said
[4:57:42] Grallus: Miz and ExtraEmily would have been better served on crim/civ chars tbh. Cop is a steep learning curve to dive in, and they haven't been around much since their academy. Would have made sense to get some more seasoned people in first.
[4:57:53] ozokar: hope you feel better soon neutrenFlower
[4:57:54] TheCombatantWombat: A lot of the cops are pretty upset with how things are run too. Even Five0Anth0 went on a ooc rant to Esfand on their patrol
[4:57:54] mcDeRose: @mcDeRose prob because of a very expensive lawsuit that had a ton of prior pd on a different server now
[4:57:54] anoobmove_twitch: I think another thing that hurts them is when people don't main PD.
[4:58:02] rien_d: @Capablist some of which got rejected by the reshuffle in 3.0 too, without being told why
[4:58:05] Clodhoppr: you good totally homie, hey may or may not show i understand but i've been rejected for WL after applying sooo many times, Its just one of them things im dealing

[6:20:31] NotReallyAScientist: !pmbu
[6:20:31] Fossabot: the PMBU, or the professional make believe union is union consisting of GTA RP streamers under 1000 viewers. The union dictates that streamers over 1000 viewers shall shout out the smaller roleplayer 5 times, as well as gift 100 subs to the streamer in order for them to be interacted with. Lastly, they will need to raid you at the end of stream.This applies to ever time that the smaller streamer is interacted with. Contact @KristoferYee to join the union.
