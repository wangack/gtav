[3:21:15] FLIGHTL355: Ending it doesn't have to be confrontation
[3:21:30] cashboyjay: Sadding and i hate that i spent so much effort for nothing to happen
[3:21:53] cashboyjay: @FLIGHTL355 yeah thats fair
[3:22:37] OR30MIRUKU: Have you tried CREAMING with Kitty ?
[3:22:43] DestroyerOfFatez: @cashboyjay sunk cost fallacy, just bc you spent time doesn't mean you have to follow it through when it seems to just make you stressed
[3:22:49] MrFelon: sometimes that's life to put in effort and it not working out
[3:22:49] FLIGHTL355: But looking at it as "I've invested so much into it" is just Sunken cost fallacy. if it's not going anywhere then it's better to cut it off sooner rather than be miserable
[3:22:54] DestroyerOfFatez: Believe in yourself
[3:22:58] rien_d: i mean, if nothing happens, does that also mean you're the one initiating contact each time? if so, you can just stop doing that

[6:07:07] antosbla: sounds like a dream
[6:07:16] Sambrass: 90% of germany you are not allowed to smoke
[6:07:22] Sambrass: in a bar
