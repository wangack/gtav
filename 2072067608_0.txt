[2:27:39] Slinbob: dapp rp
[2:27:48] OldwisePaly: scale should be minor->major->cornwood PepeLaugh
[2:27:57] BakedBeandon: 60 is too much honestly
[2:28:30] VSDuck: @BakedBeandon for something you get like 3-5 daps it's fine but just 1 it's too much
[2:28:40] BooksBlanketsandTea: so essentially have a misdemeanour vs felony, but DAP version
[2:29:09] Chitters2004: could it be based on hours on duty rather than days?
[2:29:40] LockNLoadJesus: AAAA
[2:29:40] Nightbot: AAAA
[2:29:41] VSDuck: AAAA
[2:29:44] BooksBlanketsandTea: AAAA
[2:30:06] themanwithanrx7: I get what he's saying
[2:30:11] Cerulean: watching their Rs and Ps
[2:30:11] themanwithanrx7: if yall can stay clean.. so should they
[2:30:15] EmDuBB13: feelsbadman lost 2 of the best police lol
[2:30:19] themanwithanrx7: but I like the roll off system with tiers
[2:30:24] spazgen: Have you Aced yet?
[2:30:25] haleyheartt: I don’t think it should be as harsh as they are NotLikeThis
[2:30:28] EmDuBB13: you n cleetus r gold
[2:30:57] PiiiNGOO: the dap remove thing has been brought up for over a month and hasnt been implemented at all LOL
[2:30:59] spazgen: Have you Aced yet?
[2:31:15] qHaydos: so where are lennys daps for human spiking 4 times now, tackling off roofs and shooting straight thru officers that are held hostage OMEGAKEKW
[2:31:20] themanwithanrx7: you should try asking a third time @spazgen
[2:31:25] DiaBeetusKoby: @spazgen it went through the first time bud
[2:31:36] YammersTV: @themanwithanrx7 yes but he's also arguing in bad faith, talking back shouldnt be as treated the same as excessive force. Well the duration at least.
[2:31:36] OldwisePaly: PiiiNGOO iirc the captains couldnt agree on how it works but it sounds like turner is just implementing it on his own
[2:31:45] Lilliphus: YES
[2:31:49] Lilliphus: that was wild
[2:32:10] Nightbot: Come join the discord and fill up the ranks! https://discord.gg/PMrxK3F
[2:32:17] Lilliphus: i'm replying to the "dap or community service" LUL
[2:32:18] llGoldenIl: So crim’s have to serve jail time even if found innocent later right? So shouldn’t the PD have a time waster like that to make it somewhat equal? If the charge doesn’t stick the cop is forced to serve the time as an unpaid dispatcher.
[2:32:27] MrHyde81: Lap or Dap
[2:32:27] Nsan7: god i've missed Turner
[2:32:47] random_viewer_55: it's simpler. Is wearing a hat 5 times (1 DAP each) worth mugdumping somebody on the floor (5 DAPs)
[2:32:50] haleyheartt: 5 daps for one incident when 10 daps is when you get an indefinite suspension is kinda crazy to me, but I’m also newer to PD rp so LUL
[2:33:42] mininni94: RIP Big C Sadge
[2:34:01] Slinbob: that guy loves dapps so hard. he dream about dapps
[2:34:18] Brockovitch: Clap
[2:34:42] VSDuck: @Slinbob and Trains
[2:34:44] VSDuck: AAAA
[2:34:44] Nightbot: AAAA
[2:34:50] theLastMooninite: Dap me up 🤝
[2:35:06] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: deansoWeird deansoWeird deansoWeird deansoWeird deansoWeird deansoWeird deansoWeird
[2:35:24] McMillvn: I feel like hours on duty needs to be taken into consideration. Someone with 4 DAPs in 100 hours and someone with 4 DAPs in 300 hours are vastly different.
[2:35:29] EmDuBB13: holy shit slacks lol
[2:35:34] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: saabDap saabDap saabDap saabDap
[2:35:44] MrHyde81: "Take primary, I don't have the points."
[2:35:50] VSDuck: but it doesn't make sense to have the all under one thing like Kian explained
[2:35:56] Chitters2004: he's saying you get to remove one dap per month
[2:36:00] Slinbob: minor should be 10 days. this mr dap guy is crazy.
[2:36:01] Chitters2004: that aint much
[2:36:02] skinnylegend000: hours on duty would be an absolute shit show to track.
[2:36:02] EmDuBB13: gotta say i think this stuff does need oversight
[2:36:05] TheIrishCanuck: @Lt_Custard 2 hour meeting dude
[2:36:06] DiaBeetusKoby: !burp
[2:36:06] Nightbot: Custard has burped 3492 times ltcustBurp
[2:36:10] YammersTV: Turner is being way too harsh.
[2:36:28] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: yes makes sense
[2:36:43] Slinbob: turner is addicted to daps. needs rehab. minor can be 10 days.
[2:36:49] random_viewer_55: @YammersTV yeah but that's the character
[2:37:03] duncjw: Morning Chat , Morning Streamer
[2:37:07] haleyheartt: @emdubb13 I agree lol
[2:37:07] random_viewer_55: @YammersTV xiceman is playing a military hardass
[2:37:13] OldwisePaly: Tuner is very strict and hard to the point
[2:37:13] VSDuck: This is 100% the way Turner is though he's playing it well
[2:37:16] MrHyde81: Cornwood was on duty more than anyone
[2:37:57] EmDuBB13: it makes a giant difference the hours on
[2:38:09] nebxhelix: make em do 1hr of sani to remove daps lol you get car repair mats for pd cars winner winner and it give PD look good to the civs
[2:38:14] VSDuck: The being on duty thing doesn't matter as far as the  time of daps dropping off
[2:38:19] Cerulean: maybe if the small changes started 2-3 weeks ago
[2:38:28] Lilliphus: honestly sani runs is good community service LUL
[2:38:32] themanwithanrx7: got to start somewhere
[2:38:37] BooksBlanketsandTea: if it makes a difference I think it's only because sleep deprived people have impaired decision making abilities LUL
[2:38:40] VSDuck: I don't understand why you can't have both?
[2:38:44] Inzanegaming71: Does that not add additional overhead time for staff who then can't train?
[2:38:46] Kalious78: The class slacks was meant to do in Dec n never bothered ?
[2:38:46] DiaBeetusKoby: make em dig through th trash
[2:38:47] MinotaurFluff: can people who are at suspension level take them?
[2:38:48] davidpeck_: More work for you lydiavHappy
[2:39:05] theLastMooninite: 30 month class NOOO
[2:39:12] OldwisePaly: the time on duty argument can be countered with if you are on duty more you should have more on job experience so should make less mistakes
[2:39:19] VSDuck: NO WAYYYYY FTO's are so run out as is
[2:39:22] YammersTV: Fitting with his character but yeah, Captains just dont see what PD is complaining about.
[2:39:42] EmDuBB13: ruby 5Head
[2:39:51] haleyheartt: I like ruby
[2:39:55] Edward_Theodore: the problem is certain people get targetted for daps, every cop does something that is dappable, but MOST the time people aren't dumb and don't dap people for stupid stuff thats what esfand sayed and hes right
[2:39:59] heliotrope__: I agree time shouldn’t matter. People being scared or stressed about Daps is going to make them more likely to commit mistakes.
[2:40:05] itWyrm: 1 does matter when people get 7 at a time LULW
[2:40:11] MrHyde81: Would he have to take 4 classes to wipe his record?
[2:40:13] EmDuBB13: so vindictive OMEGALUL
[2:40:14] kasper952: sniffthenewchatter
[2:40:16] Super_EJ: FTO's already have so much on there plates ltcustScared
[2:40:25] YammersTV: The only people against this, are the captains. LUL Proud of the seniors here.
[2:40:27] Slinbob: corndog. the magdumper we needed.
[2:40:29] KJCornettttt: one issue I see with the threshold is that you can get served 6 daps at once
[2:40:43] Picklz: if ppl are spending too muhc time as a cop where their work is slipping and they get daps thats their issue
[2:40:44] TheSaltyJesus: I mean there is a simple work around, just don't get DAP'd
[2:40:45] Lilliphus: 100%
[2:40:58] GloriousGlutton: think the better arguement for daps reduction based on hours is if the system is supposed to encourage betterment and learning, the individual who works more is demonstrating more quickly that they have or haven’t learned as opposed to an individual who logs on once or twice a week.
[2:41:03] VSDuck: I don't think he did for the Knight thing but that's just my opinion
[2:41:04] EmDuBB13: he deserved a dap stack for being on duty like 18 hours day ?
[2:41:10] themanwithanrx7: At least it seems like you have Slacks converted
[2:41:10] DiaBeetusKoby: @thesaltyjesus just be better EZ
[2:41:13] TheIrishCanuck: PD doesn't stack charges against criminals but will stack DAPs on officers. Unbelievable
[2:41:13] Lilliphus: 20/40/60 sounds good
[2:41:33] skinnylegend000: FTOs doing classes and cadets on top on FTO burnout?
[2:41:36] Landarokz: If all DAPs have the same drop off day, it's fine, but you need a way, like with classes, to remove minor/moderate infractions. That's fair I think.
[2:41:41] DiaBeetusKoby: @emdubb13 no for the fact he mag dumped a civ
[2:41:50] Codingale: they're dapping away
[2:41:56] wizwonder: the classes would be constant with different people having different DAPs requiring different classes
[2:42:17] EmDuBB13: @DiaBeetusKoby who was a 1 life charecter, idk i jus feel its an rp server not a punishment server.. gonna jus make people quit Sadge
[2:42:20] YammersTV: Clap articulated that very well.
[2:42:28] Kalious78: You do know it was "staged" n Dean on a 1life char he wanted to perma In fashion @lt_custard ??? It was a harmless bit of funny sbs
[2:42:30] xnightshift2658: This will show the PD high command is at least looking at the DAP system and working on it
[2:42:35] Jenfais: 4 daps for a incident where multiple officers unloaded their clips into a suspect seems overboard. +1 for something that was he said she said. literally gave him 5 in one sitting because it got heated, just enough to get him suspended. That seems harsh.
[2:42:36] Slinbob: @emdubb13 agreed
[2:43:08] Brockovitch: peepoWow Ruby
[2:43:13] VSDuck: @Kalious78 doesn't matter if it was a funny SBS it's still something that has to be RP'd out
[2:43:20] naturally79: whole reason there is a first, second, third degree of a charge. the more serious carries more weight. minor oops should be minor like you said
[2:43:38] DiaBeetusKoby: SBS ends serious EVERYTIME in RP
[2:43:44] EmDuBB13: thats worth 5 daps tho?
[2:43:45] Jenfais: he deserved daps. i just think the amount was a lot. Turner is saying 3 for severe things - he got 4.
[2:43:48] Slinbob: it was brilliant rp moment
[2:43:49] Slinbob: thats all
[2:43:50] Chasen2810: maybe as a compromise do 30/60/90 days so u increase the really serious offences while lowering the minor ones?
[2:43:53] Edward_Theodore: he should've been daped but not 5
[2:43:58] chokebot17: Double tapping is an IRL war crime just so you guys know. I don't like bringing irl into things, but it's a serious offense
[2:44:05] RadahTatTat: @gloriousglutton encouraging increasing hours would turn this whitelisted job into a cop-grinder
[2:44:07] xXxEV0xXx: is there a guidline they follow on how many daps they are supposed to give for each violation? Or do they just wing in?
[2:44:17] random_viewer_55: @Chasen2810 I agree with that
[2:44:18] Slinbob: that crim life was only goin on way. out. LUL
[2:44:18] JasonVoorhees71: pepeSmoke
[2:44:23] OldwisePaly: its 5 daps bc its excessive with a deadly. Its in the SoPs
[2:44:25] YammersTV: I love these seniors Pog
[2:44:25] BooksBlanketsandTea: Ruby is amazing NODDERS
[2:44:25] Kilanii: *Some overinvested parasocial underinformed comment about X streamer and X situation*
[2:44:26] EmDuBB13: ruby is a genius
[2:44:39] MinotaurFluff: @Chasen2810 90 is way too long, 3 times statute of limitations, might as well fire those who use excessive force
[2:44:40] GloriousGlutton: that’s the issue people don’t get, sure there’s an ooc rationale why esfand or cornwood did the double tap, but in character those around cornwood still have to act accordingly with the in game reality their characters are facing
[2:44:44] Codingale: Ruby was great in public, she was head of P&T for a good reason
[2:44:45] RadahTatTat: force slacks to promote Ruby kivaMadge 👇 NAOW
[2:44:49] Lilliphus: essaying
[2:44:52] Landarokz: If Cornwood had an extended mag gun, he'd still be a cop imo
[2:44:53] Lilliphus: chat rn
[2:44:58] Kilanii: @Lilliphus this
[2:45:00] MrHyde81: The city moves too fast for the 60 day rigidity
[2:45:06] Slinbob: cuz of dap city?
[2:45:13] Slinbob: city of daps
[2:45:35] YammersTV: These captains have to talk to their staff more, something seniors have been listening to.
[2:45:35] MinotaurFluff: Smadge no we NEED more circling
[2:45:36] bonelessspaghet1: minimum hours worked per day * 60 days seems better than just 60 days.
[2:45:41] Jenfais: I think the easiest solution is just reducing based off severity like you suggested. like 15, 30, 60. classes and all that is just gonna be abused and more work
[2:45:53] random_viewer_55: 30/60/90
[2:45:55] random_viewer_55: better
[2:46:17] BooksBlanketsandTea: ppCircle <- Custy do this
[2:46:17] VSDuck: awww come on maybe a little circling
[2:46:19] Codingale: 5 hr meeting lets gooo
[2:46:20] Slinbob: 20 days irl is so long.
[2:46:47] xXxEV0xXx: If there isnt, I think there needs to be a guidline they need to make a follow and what violations get what daps.. cause right now, you dont know what can or cant get you dapped, so your always walking and egg shells it seems. And the reason can change from person to person and from HC to HC.
[2:47:22] yetisarentreal: Dap's lasting twice as long as statute of limitations is pretty annoying
[2:47:36] TheIrishCanuck: Captain "In one ear out the other" Slacks
[2:48:01] silpofoido: Frost pogChamp
[2:48:17] DatDudeJakeC: about being afraid to escalate when those situations are worth more daps.  Ruby is 100% right.
[2:48:46] RadahTatTat: pasta in the locker room Gladge
[2:48:56] DatDudeJakeC: my message got cut off, ignore that LUL
[2:49:06] OldwisePaly: most Daps are fairly common sense stuff. It feels like only the earlier Daps about uniform and other minor things were inconsistent
[2:49:11] RadahTatTat: YEP
[2:49:26] TorridK: esfandCOPS Daps
[2:49:31] bonelessspaghet1: is there any reason why its not hours worked? i seriously cannot think of a downside to that.
[2:49:37] DiaBeetusKoby: you’ve even said on radio “if I call it I’m the one who’ll be dapped.. if I call to shoot.. shoot!”
[2:49:46] RadahTatTat: they need to get stronger in legal background if they’re too nervous to escalate YEP
[2:49:59] bonelessspaghet1: hours worked = more experience = more learning
[2:50:10] DiaBeetusKoby: @bonelessspaghet1 makes it easier/harder for those who work ooc jobs
[2:50:12] RadahTatTat: tying DAPs to hours worked would encourage cop-grinding KEKW
[2:50:18] Kalious78: You say that but never opened fore n hesitated till they backed a truck into moseleys n blew it up instead of outside
[2:50:39] bonelessspaghet1: @DiaBeetusKoby true
[2:50:42] OldwisePaly: which means they should be expected to do less thing that should be Dap'd for bonelessspaghet1
[2:51:00] theLastMooninite: isnt there scene recreation now? dont they not need to take evidence photos anymore?
[2:51:04] yetisarentreal: @RadahTatTat It would also encourage cops to be on shift. Which is another problem atm
[2:51:04] robertsmithjr: where did this new batch of rper's and chatters come from that are so soft, im so confused
[2:51:35] DiaBeetusKoby: @thelastmooninite rp wise you need the picture to recreate the scene correctly
[2:51:48] theLastMooninite: oh gotcha

[2:53:46] RadahTatTat: I wanna hear Ruby yell “CLEAR COMMS” one day Gladge
[2:53:50] DiaBeetusKoby: OOC = Officers On Crack
[2:53:51] robertsmithjr: its so weird, if you have expressed your point thats good, but harping over and over and running the point into the ground becomes whining
[2:54:07] Brockovitch: "make sure they're all safe before you open fire" - Turner
[2:54:11] YammersTV: Ruby should really be in a higher position, has the coolest head. Gladge
[2:54:22] DiaBeetusKoby: @robertsmithjr chill bud no one here is whining
[2:54:28] ostseeurlauber01: ltcustLicked

[2:55:20] robertsmithjr: @DiaBeetusKoby i wasnt meaning anyone in this group, i was speaking more in general, but i gotcha
[2:55:28] DatDudeJakeC: Ruby and Kian are right on that.  Too many cooks on the radio lead to miscommunication, especially with that many officers on the scene
[2:55:35] amber_bijoux: sgt york soon
[2:55:36] RadahTatTat: @yetisarentreal just because I say “waffles are good” doesn’t mean I implicitly think pancakes are terrible. stop straw-manning arguments.
[2:55:38] xnightshift2658: Also, using handguns to make precision shots where a long gun is needed
[2:56:14] YammersTV: HAWKED EZ Clap
[2:56:18] yetisarentreal: @RadahTatTat Not an argument, I'm not arguing OK
[2:56:19] theLastMooninite: I think moon/Lenny will fess up immediately

[2:56:38] MrHyde81: Is there even a firing range at MRPD anymore?
[2:56:39] RapidStream: I can't believe you would say something so incredibly real and true.
[2:56:48] YammersTV: He admitted in the report KEKW
[2:56:48] RadahTatTat: @yetisarentreal yeah you’re being oddly passive aggressive in a twitch chat KEKW yikes
[2:56:48] slymox: DAPs will continue until morale improves!
[2:56:53] Chasen2810: the more I think about 30/60/90 makes the most sense with a system to be able to remove dabs since minor offences will just wear off while mayor ones will need to be worked off sry im still stuck on that
[2:57:01] yetisarentreal: @RadahTatTat OK
[2:57:02] random_viewer_55: shot only once -> it was a headshot -> Vinny out
[2:57:05] curiouscoalmine: i can hear Lenny's argument now
[2:57:07] random_viewer_55: efficiency 100%
[2:57:17] VSDuck: IMO slacks shouldn't get a say in this because he was one of the hostages and was under duress, didn't have a clear head. Maybe I'm thinking about it wrong though
[2:57:19] BooksBlanketsandTea: @slymox alternatively, DAPS will continue until policing improves
[2:57:34] RadahTatTat: @yetisarentreal :)
[2:57:43] DiaBeetusKoby: Books NODDERS
[2:57:47] robertsmithjr: im curious where long gun came from, where i grew up and live its always been rifle
[2:57:52] Brockovitch: I'm excited for lenny to articulate it when moon expects the dap for that great shot
[2:57:59] slabbyj_: Lenny will admit to what happened
[2:58:03] DatDudeJakeC: Ruby and Kian are right on this.  Too many cooks on the radio lead to miscommunication, especially with that many officers on the scene
[2:58:22] ShadowedSeraphim: I think you lose 1 dap per "x" work hours to promote people to be on and work
[2:58:40] xnightshift2658: @robertsmithjr Its a legal term
[2:58:42] DiaBeetusKoby: @shadowedseraphim welcome to the chat.. and Nono
[2:58:43] theLastMooninite: Lenny will admit it to a senior he respects, which is most of them
[2:58:51] daisy197012: What’s the game called?
[2:58:51] Brockovitch: peepoWow Ruby
[2:59:06] Landarokz: I think there should be two options: Option A: You have the 20/40/60 etc. drop off for offenses OR Option B: Consistent dropoff for all but you can train/take classes to remove less serious ones.
[2:59:10] daisy197012: Is this server open to the public or is it waitlisted?

[3:01:01] VSDuck: @daisy197012 Yes
[3:01:03] BooksBlanketsandTea: LMAOOO that's what I said
[3:01:08] DiaBeetusKoby: ight yall no more
[3:01:08] ShadowedSeraphim: @bonelessspaghet1 but any safety concept is built around the fact that the more you are around a hazard the more likely you are to have an accident..
[3:01:15] xnightshift2658: Sounding like cornwood
[3:01:17] DatDudeJakeC: 15-30-45 is better than Slacks 20-40-60 imo.  Either would be better than the current system though. @Lt_Custard
[3:01:22] Landarokz: Capital Punishment DAP
[3:01:26] YammersTV: I mean there's a reason why most of the PD respects seniors more.
[3:01:29] BooksBlanketsandTea: @daisy197012 this is white list, not public
[3:01:31] robertsmithjr: @xnightshift2658 just looked it up, the difference is long gun is all in clusive, so anything you wouldnt shoot 1 handed, so rifle, shotgun falls under it
[3:01:32] arcticOP: actually a really good way to word it
[3:01:38] Codingale: @Landarokz falsifying reports
[3:01:39] TorridK: Duncaning
[3:01:45] MinotaurFluff: Duncaning
[3:01:46] vladcully: Duncaning

[3:02:21] vladcully: 🚆
[3:02:26] bonelessspaghet1: @ShadowedSeraphim exactly, but an easy way around that is just to not be around said hazard for a long time.

[3:02:46] Jenfais: 15-30-60 is good - 60 is plenty fair for mag dumping into a body - still needs to have weight as a punishment
[3:02:47] kasper952: AAAA
[3:03:12] random_viewer_55: I vote 30/60/90
[3:03:23] ShadowedSeraphim: @bonelessspaghet1 I would agree but if the people that are here are only doing 20 hours a week theres going to be a lot of dead spots with little to no one working
[3:03:29] DiaBeetusKoby: 3/6/9 NODDERS
[3:03:30] Slinbob: 10:
[3:03:32] MrHyde81: Phone call between Turner and Slacks: "mm" "hm"
[3:04:06] BooksBlanketsandTea: KEKW I thought McNulty was getting a promo there for a second
[3:04:23] VenatusVox: Brit in BC Here, your in BC too?
[3:04:27] RadahTatTat: @shadowedseraphim then they’ll hire more people to fill the shifts. encouraging people to be on shift for higher hours leads to more mistakes and faster burnout
[3:04:55] DiaBeetusKoby: chat can we please drop the hours on duty convo? it’s not gonna happen..
[3:04:56] BooksBlanketsandTea: @RadahTatTat yeah honestly I think half the issue is that sleep deprivation doesn't help with decision making
[3:05:03] YammersTV: Captains do need a check, but don't know how they'd go about it.
[3:05:10] ShadowedSeraphim: @RadahTatTat I would agree but its 2 months in and there already burn out from training people
[3:05:17] BooksBlanketsandTea: @DiaBeetusKoby bazzShake drop this cutie
[3:05:20] RadahTatTat: @booksblanketsandtea NODDERS that’s why I like when cops have off duty time
[3:05:26] OldwisePaly: technically 2 people since its mayor and deputy mayor
[3:05:31] DiaBeetusKoby: @booksblanketsandtea don’t mind if I do
[3:05:37] BooksBlanketsandTea: @DiaBeetusKoby ltcustShy
[3:05:38] bonelessspaghet1: @ShadowedSeraphim there's always going to be downsides, your never going to have a perfect system for this type of thing. Even after so many years nopixel has existed they still haven't found a perfect system.
[3:05:44] RadahTatTat: @shadowedseraphim that’s not due to people NOT pulling longer shifts tho
[3:05:57] theLastMooninite: Mobster Max
[3:06:04] BooksBlanketsandTea: Chat, a question: is it weird to have hot sauce on toast
[3:06:18] BooksBlanketsandTea: instead of like, I dunno. Peanut butter.
[3:06:22] AleczTheMage: Just hot sauce? Or sauce on other things on top of toast?
[3:06:25] krooksoner210: Mmmm
[3:06:30] BooksBlanketsandTea: Yeah like used as a spread
[3:06:33] RadahTatTat: @shadowedseraphim encouraging the characters AND the players to have a healthy schedule is of the upmost importance
[3:06:33] DiaBeetusKoby: @bonelessspaghet1 that’s because no matter what.. someone will dislike the changes one way or another
[3:06:37] ShadowedSeraphim: @RadahTatTat I know but i'm say if since the start people were only doing 20 hrs a week the city would have been burning a while ago
[3:06:44] AleczTheMage: If it's just bread + hot sauce yeah that's kinda weird lmao
[3:06:46] DiaBeetusKoby: @booksblanketsandtea nah you’re crazy.. what kinda sauce
[3:06:48] BooksBlanketsandTea: because my flatmate did this for breakfast this morning and I'm trying to work out if I'm likely to be murdered in my sleep
[3:06:51] TheSaltyJesus: Books you eat your toast however you enjoy iy
[3:06:54] TheSaltyJesus: it*
[3:07:09] krooksoner210: LUL
[3:07:10] ShadowedSeraphim: @RadahTatTat I think everyone should be encouraged to have a good time. It shouldn't matter their schedule
[3:07:14] LockNLoadJesus: KEKW
[3:07:21] DiaBeetusKoby: @booksblanketsandtea Gladge it wasn’t you.. but like Tabasco?
[3:07:25] YammersTV: I have a feeling, Turner will be too emotional. It is Moon and Crane in there LUL
[3:07:26] bonelessspaghet1: @DiaBeetusKoby real, people will always find a way to complain about something
[3:07:30] RadahTatTat: @shadowedseraphim the. those weren’t the right people. they’re establishing a brand new PD and it’s only been a couple months.
[3:07:32] BooksBlanketsandTea: AAAA McNulty has such a job-crush on Turner
[3:07:32] Nightbot: AAAA
[3:07:48] krooksoner210: I thought he was talking about a colonoscopy
[3:07:56] Brockovitch: how often are mayor elections?
[3:07:57] BooksBlanketsandTea: @DiaBeetusKoby I think it was like a sweet chilli or something?

[3:14:10] MrHyde81: Trye
[3:14:18] MrHyde81: True
[3:14:20] VenatusVox: How do you think its going to go with Cornwood?
[3:14:20] VSDuck: You mean for the knight stuff? or something else?
[3:14:40] DiaBeetusKoby: @VSDuck the pit
[3:14:53] OldwisePaly: Cornwoods final dap was the knight stuff not the excessive force
[3:14:56] VSDuck: OHHH right okay
[3:15:01] ShadowedSeraphim: @Lt_Custard The Bryan Knight DAP was the last one but I agree on the shooting one
[3:15:05] VSDuck: RP IS custyCringe
[3:15:06] Brockovitch: i think cornwoods real "final" dap is the knight one
[3:15:07] Slinbob: he had it coming
[3:15:27] APHSnake: Cornwood needed to get knocked off his high horse eventually
[3:15:40] MrHyde81: SBS turns into RP all the time, and it should
[3:16:02] VenatusVox: @APHSnake but might become sheriff lol
[3:16:05] DiaBeetusKoby: SBS is almost guaranteed to turn serious
[3:16:13] plawpsruby: I think biggest thing about that meeting is kian knows Turner likes kian the most
[3:16:18] WhoIsD33z: exactly and they think just cause its sbs then if captains dont punish thats literally just failed rp then
[3:16:29] VSDuck: @plawpsruby True and real
[3:16:33] AndresSaysHey: The ol Barry Benson separate and manipulate approach
[3:16:47] DiaBeetusKoby: agreed
[3:16:50] chone33: me too
[3:17:06] ShadowedSeraphim: I agree.. Duncan for Chief.. jk lol
[3:17:10] DiaBeetusKoby: need sgt and Lt first tbh
[3:17:10] APHSnake: @VenatusVox that is if he becomes Sheriff then Los Santos is probably screwed
[3:17:12] Brockovitch: Aware 2 months in
[3:17:19] VSDuck: Bones for CoP
[3:17:23] ido_opsies: McNulty for cop EZ
[3:17:25] skinnylegend000: we all know Kians already CoP. has been since day 1.
[3:17:30] notarealstudio: ltcustLove ltcustLove hello everyone
[3:17:35] WhoIsD33z: even if it were to be captain only, i feel like Turner is the best for it but considering his situation it wouldnt be the best for him to be CoP either
[3:17:36] chone33: yep
[3:17:37] Super_EJ: McNulty for COP
[3:17:43] DezalbM: we all know bobby charles is the future chief of police
[3:17:43] theLastMooninite: I think PD needs more structure in the middle than another layer on top
[3:17:54] OldwisePaly: I feel like the captains jobs is the build the PD not eventually run it. Having an officer be CoP with the captains still in place makes more sense
[3:17:57] DiaBeetusKoby: if McNulty gets passed for CoP and it’s not ruby…. Madge
[3:18:02] DiaBeetusKoby: ruth
[3:18:04] ShadowedSeraphim: I do think the 3 captains make it take a long time for decisions to be made because of their schedule
[3:18:08] chone33: no chief yet. I’m all about slow burn
[3:18:11] Codingale: whos ruth
[3:18:12] VenatusVox: Ruthless
[3:18:13] MrHyde81: James Randall is already COP
[3:18:22] APHSnake: Turner for COP and Ruby for Sergeant
[3:18:25] Brockovitch: i vote ruby
[3:18:30] WhoIsD33z: pretty.... ruthless you might say? LUL
[3:18:35] chone33: Ruth is great
[3:18:36] AngelReborn_Official: Isn't Ruth way to abcent to be chief of police though?
[3:18:38] RadahTatTat: same YEP if you had to choose out of the 3 Capts I’d def pic Ruth
[3:18:38] themanwithanrx7: it's beacuse she daps their streamer
[3:18:39] DiaBeetusKoby: @chone33 unfortunately we’re in the minority on that opinion
[3:18:45] themanwithanrx7: it's just L hopper takes
[3:18:49] MrHyde81: I hope someone is watching your blip
[3:18:50] APHSnake: Yeah many people are riding the Ruth hate train
[3:18:51] DiaBeetusKoby: slow burn that is
[3:18:55] keleviii: I wish Ruth could get on more, people only see and hear the negative rather than the full picture of her RP
[3:19:04] WhoIsD33z: i dont wanna name names but i think we all know where the Ruth hate comes from honestly
[3:19:06] Codingale: Ruby ran for LSPD whcih I couldn't vote for in public pd, got the runner up spot and ass chief lol
[3:19:06] goddamnsoul: Ruth is fair I think
[3:19:20] wizwonder: havnt seen much of Ruth so i make no comments on that character
[3:19:21] Brockovitch: YEP
[3:19:25] RadahTatTat: YEP yeerrrp
[3:19:32] DiaBeetusKoby: keep IRL out of it please
[3:19:43] catmeaty: jean paul should be captain smile
[3:19:59] WhoIsD33z: I mean there are people spreading how Ruth isnt on duty when that literally isnt true
[3:20:16] Landarokz: It would be cops robbing sanitation lol, would be funny
[3:20:21] APHSnake: my opinion Turner for CoP and Ruby for Sergeant
[3:20:22] goddamnsoul: L
[3:20:24] VSDuck: I can't do Reddit anymore
[3:20:26] ReiSundae: Do you think police are in the same level as crims progression? More guns circulating vs number of cops on shift
[3:20:27] VenatusVox: I only go on Reddit for Ukraine
[3:20:33] DiaBeetusKoby: xqc reports.. and we thought Lennys reports were long
[3:20:35] chone33: @diabeetuskoby true.

[3:20:38] VSDuck: <--- getting too old for Reddit AAAA
[3:20:43] StarSquatch: Ruth parsing orange for PD tanking
[3:20:47] OldwisePaly: Everything I see on Reddit is defending Ruth unless its a CG post
[3:20:51] RadahTatTat: Reddit = FanFiction tbh KEKW
[3:21:06] chone33: @diabeetuskoby they can Smeg off

[3:21:22] plawpsruby: Did you transfer the 6k to O for house decorations
[3:21:24] RadahTatTat: imagine having a reddit account EZ
[3:21:29] VSDuck: Unless you are in said shift it shouldn't matter to you
[3:21:51] ShadowedSeraphim: yeah just like that crime isn't uniform across all shifts
[3:21:54] VenatusVox: how will RP transition to GTA 6 and are there plans for that yet or too early?
[3:21:58] RadahTatTat: shift 2 FeelsStrongMan
[3:22:09] DiaBeetusKoby: @venatusvox still too early
[3:22:15] MinotaurFluff: @VenatusVox about 3-6 yrs too early
[3:22:15] VSDuck: So if you go into shift 3 are you more like an officer and not a Snr? for the shift 3 problems?
[3:22:36] keleviii: Valid point ,if you're anything but a Captain you literally can't guarantee any solid changes, especially if it's this messy
[3:22:42] VSDuck: AAAA
