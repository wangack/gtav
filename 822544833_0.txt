[5:36:07] StreamElements: Please do not spoil ANYTHING related to what is happening in other people's GTA stream/game. If you tell Andy what other characters are doing, it ruins the story and it's against the rules. Meta in Chat will result in an immediate 24 hour timeout, and in some cases a perm ban. Please don't spoil the game for all the viewers that want to see what will happen naturally.

[5:39:03] 8beezy: @owenrock1221 ok kid
[5:39:07] IAMCuD: The reason we dont meta, is because even if they dont mean to some folks let it effect their decision making, which can ruin good organic role play. This stuff is not scripted, so watching it play out is always best
