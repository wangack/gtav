[0:35:28] eeveejayy: if the casino makes 50k profit each day and you’re on 10% profit share for 90 days that’s 450k for your 100k
[0:35:30] Zunnun: !sarah @freddoford
[0:35:30] Streamlabs: Sarah:"left is right basically"
[0:35:31] DaviMury: Wats up
[0:35:31] h3rosmist: it’s legal
[0:35:33] MexiBrent: do you think a casino in a house is legal?
[0:35:35] IRISHT0NKA: legal for how long this is the thing tho
[0:35:36] improvisablex: +1 DAP o7 Invest in criminals o7 Give them money o7 No info in return o7
[0:35:37] fixer_18: Also if you promise cops will visit often that is free protection. It's your duty to stop conflicts.
[0:35:47] gbcmelo: GuysRefreshChatterinoIUploadedAnotherEmote
[0:35:49] Zunnun: @freddoford yes he Does have a girlfriend

[0:35:55] Mi1ox: They will Wash so much money when Bank Robbery realeses
[0:35:56] EddieMakes: NotLikeThis
[0:36:01] sixteenbackup: man this business rp is so sick I love it
[0:36:02] m4l1kkk: @bdg_parth28 he won't get that though, he can't command eternal profits for just 50k with no stake
[0:36:03] BalerionBlackDread: I dont think admins will allow cops to invest that kind of money, cause it will hurt economy a lot
[0:36:06] bigdewgo: 5 dollars per head was crazy haha. But a entrance fee of 5 dollars would cover a 1 dollar per head
[0:36:06] MangErick7: i dont think is legal but also i think its not illegal because theres no legislation yet
[0:36:10] DonNiko99: @improvisablex He should make a snitch contract for investing in the company
[0:36:11] EddieMakes: PepeLaugh
[0:36:11] stocker218: did they get the pd gun back last night or drop charges I had to sleep n missed it
[0:36:12] DaviMury: Did you invest in Mr K Real State company
[0:36:12] fixer_18: Talk to lawyers about a good deal too
[0:36:15] 1evilshark: u said u aint married

[0:36:23] eeveejayy: if you get suspended you can be a blackjack dealer
[0:36:25] improvisablex: omE Mommy Ruth Can I invest in 4head omE
[0:36:26] sean019822: tyrone in jail stocker
[0:36:28] MulattoExpress: He told you a 50k investment would get you 5% for the 90 days - meaning they’re valuing the business at a million dollars. The 90 days thing is dumb as hell tho
[0:36:32] Mickerson2: @maxwellcan that’s what 4head says but I also don’t think it’s gonna truly be legal and if it is it won’t be for long
[0:36:35] m4l1kkk: Eternal profits only makes sense if he owns some of it, that's what 4head said
[0:36:37] brook_cs2: @improvisablex NAHH
[0:36:40] Athasin: @eeveejayy 450K for a business that will make millions due to his 100K, nah
[0:36:40] Zunnun: @bigdewgo they investing themselves in houses and shit tho

[0:36:43] MaxwellCAN: @MangErick7 omie has gotten confirmation ooc about it
[0:36:45] BDG_parth28: @m4l1kkk  yh thats the BEST case no negotiation scenario ,
[0:36:46] garetha473: is tyrone free yet
[0:36:49] bobdang07hd: 5% equity is fuck all if they have several investors. royalties make sense to get your money back then turn that into equity after $ paid back. otherwise 5% of shit is just shit 💩
[0:37:02] fixer_18: You should have a lawyer or some bussines guy to also give advise. This can be a huge thing
[0:37:04] MangErick7: @MangErick7 oh i didnt know about this
[0:37:04] mmelloon: Officer shiesty !!!
[0:37:05] MaxwellCAN: @Mickerson2 omie has gotten confirmation ooc about it 󠀀
[0:37:05] improvisablex: Have they raided yet?
[0:37:06] zomgeo: has the search warrant been approved?
[0:37:08] dylboy909: technically only problem with this is entering business with known crime
[0:37:09] Miss_Jess00: wait how long did Tyrone get?
[0:37:10] MatmatikOfficial: are you riding with Joey Parmesan today?
[0:37:12] surelyURjokingMrFeynman: @bobdang07hd 5% is 5%, doesn't matter how many investors there are.
[0:37:14] Valyk27: also maybe not pump money in the city economy yet
[0:37:18] little_birdie27: They need your investment. So you hold the power to negotiate.
[0:37:25] Stackswyd: you’re dealing snow HUH
[0:37:28] playboyfl: help
[0:37:28] sean019822: snow really fucked up tyrones life he knew him 10 mins😂😂😂😂😂

[0:37:31] sixteenbackup: 2.3k already goated my bro
[0:37:33] mortuusintus12: he said its legal, so best thing to do is ask ramee if its on the works. and with his record, hes probably pitched with it too
[0:37:38] bewpy: hasnt that fool seen shark tank? Kappa
[0:37:39] dylboy909: RICO case could mes you up bad
[0:37:43] improvisablex: "Ask ramee" SCHIZO
[0:37:43] DrWings87: why are y'all only raiding 1 of the 3 people involved in the robbery of an officer?
[0:37:44] EddieMakes: early investors are meant to be a good deal for them, because its a complete gamble
[0:37:47] Nahsta: the cash they need to get started is no different than the investment money.  they are trying to make it seem different to scam people with the 90 days
[0:37:52] Zunnun: @surelyurjokingmrfeynman still not a good deal for deano tbh that was what we where trying to say
[0:37:56] DaviMury: Get a lawyer for sure and they need you so press him to make a good deal
[0:37:56] veetu17: Yooooo gettingSturdy
[0:37:59] BDG_parth28: Yep
[0:38:03] bobdang07hd: @surelyurjokingmrfeynman and what is 5% of nothing if it goes to shit after spending 50k?
[0:38:03] playboyfl: help
[0:38:08] Athasin: @Athasin At the moment, there aren't a lot of people rolling around with $100K ready to give. So Dean knows he's in a position of power
[0:38:12] BDG_parth28: But what u asking is alot tbf
[0:38:13] sojurma: it's like S list movie actors get percentage of each ticket sold right?
[0:38:13] improvisablex: Percentage of company is REALLY BAD since its crim omE
[0:38:13] Deventerwarrior: If they count the people going in they will just count low

[0:38:27] silentstrikerz: fair, take risk off the table
[0:38:30] Raccoonsteps: what happened to the lovemore case is it going to court or did they settle
[0:38:37] sixteenbackup: a casino will make a certain percentage per x amount of heads anyway otherwise it wouldn’t be a business so got to reconsider it
[0:38:38] Robo_Cat2000: not making money off the gambling just entries
[0:38:39] Zunnun: Not a lot ask for more EZ
[0:38:40] Zstie: first one to reply gets a gift sub

[0:50:44] khlaah: @Deansocool If Ruth wants you guys to raid it, make sure she has that order in writing, don't need to be hit with DAPs or a lawsuit, cuz then it falls on Ruth
[0:50:45] joster124: Don't ask to be sick I got sick once and from the am sick every 2 days like tf
[0:50:46] sonadapop: aint no way Turner would do a raid without filling out a report right?
[0:50:53] sojurma: vits, magnesium, zinc those stuff
[0:50:56] Athasin: You build your immune system to what? ... Continue to get sick to build it?
[0:51:00] eaglezFly: getting sick has nothing to do with your immune buddy
[0:51:09] Panos_97: @sonadapop Good thinking
[0:51:18] Athasin: Legally you HAVE to do it because you have no proof that it was done.
[0:51:19] xypher85: @dan_f900 slide me a fiver and you got it

[0:51:46] little_birdie27: Guys you can strengthen your immune system. Your body learns to fight certain germs after you're exposed to it.
[0:51:46] eaglezFly: @weirdbeardplays i never get sick though and when i do its always mild so explain that
[0:51:53] marneraiders: Just Read the laws, if there isn’t anything about raiding twice, you should be good
[0:51:54] improvisablex: Nahhh but you will be sick eventually anyways
[0:51:54] zKenny___: That's why you get vaccines lol
[0:51:58] Morgaaann: @Deansocool Turner was asking judge where to put evidence because the Warrant is locked, so he made this for the results but didn't do the raid!
[0:51:59] Vince_dev_: just never leave the house again
[0:51:59] kb420ps: Captain Ruth said do the raid. Are you refusing an order from your Captain????
[0:52:00] ScreenFresh: if he did raid why wouldnt he add evidence of stuff found+
[0:52:00] Athasin: Right now if you don't do it and it wasn't done you get in trouble. If you do it when it was already done Turner gets in trouble.
[0:52:01] ScreenFresh: ?
[0:52:08] IDepS: just go to the gym

[2:23:11] Eldargrim: watch some shark tank
[2:23:12] Frog69: or take all the money and business proposal gets denied by mayor
[2:23:13] Nofcks: ramee is their legal team
[2:23:13] kimkongo: the better the company is doing the more money you make
[2:23:15] BDG_parth28: Well then u have to be the in the circle investor
[2:23:17] Athasin: Thing is you're asking for equity but you don't want any of the risks that come with equity.
[2:23:17] bobdang07hd: not one person has a business yet but there gonna fuck tou for 125k while your spitting honey out with your clap
[2:23:18] sticks26: @athasin he doesn't have to wait long. The business won't grow too big in a couple days
[2:23:18] Fusegate: if youre investing the same amount as them then it makes no sense for you to be out after three months
[2:23:18] chapoop_: its like u not gonna cum in me and buy the plan B afterwards i get u cuh
[2:23:18] naigreen19: I’d say 6 months
[2:23:19] JayJayMills: you can't invest 50% of the business and not be part owner

[2:23:21] luther1g: if they invest 200k and u invest 100k u should own 33% no like an invstor?
[2:23:23] kingbeerx: @Deansocool Make the royalties based on the amount of members they have to their casino....They are bound to have a membership going on right?
[2:23:23] Superhank: when the pd getting better cars?
[2:23:25] hinatashoyou10: like he said u can make a new deal after the 90 days
[2:23:25] azzzzlan: Whos the richest person in the city do you reckon? Tommy T?

[2:23:29] mr_vibe01: roight

[2:23:59] nzofab: wait till ramee get in sumDuck
[2:24:03] StevenB79: Ask for 3 times your investment return
[2:24:03] JayJayMills: tell them you want to be part owner for investment
[2:24:17] sticks26: @athasin this is different to stocks as well. It's an investment into a business that's needs money to grow
[2:24:23] HaychSD: I'd get Ramee to write up a contract that says prior to the 90 days conclusion - You want terms to renegotiate  and a minimum ROI or full refund @Deansocool
[2:24:25] captain_steve_420: I love Ramee as a character but man every time he talks I want to punch him
[2:24:29] joosh1806: Tommy t is definitely not the richest in the server whoever asked that
[2:24:29] kimkongo: @kingbeerx why would they want memberships? anyone can walk in and gamble
[2:24:34] LegacyTwitxh: can you not tell them you’ve been offered to invest into a rival casino instead? see if they change their tone
[2:24:36] azzzzlan: @birdking416 I have no idea
[2:24:37] Athasin: @sticks26 If it doesn't grow too much then it's the same situation he is in right now, where they say no to reinvestment. But now they also have the money for initial growth.
[2:24:39] dubbini: what if you talk with more people who have money to group together and have a higher initial buying power
[2:24:40] BAKAlakakaa: donowall
[2:24:44] Flueoffdoom: Wloud
[2:24:45] cagnog: has the raid happened?
[2:24:46] Flueoffdoom: modCheck
[2:24:51] scootypebbles: @Deansocool Going to have Ramee draw up a legal contract?
[2:24:54] Legend4270: have ramee negotiate for you and you can also get it in writing @Deansocool
[2:24:59] marneraiders: you want Passive income ? Then you can’t expect 5%! Realistic would be 1% or even lower
[2:25:00] Flueoffdoom: lol i can

[2:25:04] VenomVeinZ: AYAYA
[2:25:06] Athasin: @sticks26 What they need right now is seed money hence why that's all they're asking for. They don't want investors later on.
[2:25:07] jinnytolls: HUH
[2:25:07] janmajays: AYAYA ?

[2:25:23] Streamlabs: 3x AYAYA combo
[2:25:26] entvidya: wasn't it the local that hit them
[2:25:39] Athasin: @sticks26 So you agreeing to initial investments and then try to be an investor later (when they don't want any later investors) is just shooting yourself in the foot.
[2:25:43] armedgolem01: or u could make them need u and be there constant bank roll and get a % of the house every night if u trust them like that
[2:25:43] R5F_: send the interrogation recording to the officer
[2:25:44] red_eyed_jed1: yes it was
[2:25:46] tr0kgaming: its risky though what if they do illegal shit down the line and its tied to the casino, then goodbye investment regardless if your implicated @Deansocool
[2:26:42] Athasin: @tr0kgaming He will get his money back by then, and then he'll get those royalties while they last.

[2:28:46] chaosproductions: LULW
[2:28:52] sticks26: @athasin then he should buy equity instead cause the 3 month thing is a scam. They easily cut him out if he just gives them the seed money
[2:29:40] AsgardJC: SO WHAT ENDED UP HAPPENING WITH THE GUN STUFF YESTERDAY?
[2:29:46] chaosproductions: man has $181 in his pocket
[2:29:47] Athasin: @sticks26 Correct, what he wants is equity. But he doesn't want the trappings of equity (i.e. his name as one of the owners to a business that might do illegal stuff).
[2:29:59] kimkongo: @sticks26 scam? they literally asked him if he wants to make money

[6:10:09] theredfrosts: @drwings87 Yeah it’s hard enough to convict already in this.
[6:10:09] feraldog7: why even have court, just believe every police word
[6:10:12] xstrawberry20: who did he robbed?
[6:10:21] zrynnn: if the judges okay'd the warrant for what evidence you had, theres no way they'd find him not guilty with the same evidence.
[6:10:26] scootypebbles: The cop that was robbed remembers the faces of the individuals that robbed her

[6:10:41] chunce0: theres a difference betweent he word of a pd officer and someone who has charges on their record, than a officer and someone with 0 charges
[6:10:41] MDM4ever1986HD: @Scrol1z why you being rudE?
[6:10:45] chmbrs: theres alot of factors into him being guilty. he was ID'd. he also conveniently was the one that picked up the drop off money. etc
[6:10:47] macneutron: @DrWings87 Depends on the type of lawyer he gets. The beauty of it is that it can go either way with a good lawyer
[6:10:47] MrPhoNoodle: do u actually get a cut of the fine?

[6:11:32] Bushcat94: @chapoop_  was it positive?
[6:11:36] J1_Boss: I think this is going to be a very close court case if there is a good lawyer he could definitely win
[6:11:37] brando_m23: have someone go up too Tyrone
[6:11:40] Zunnun: @zackraore don't think you have seen the whole situation but if you did you would understand

[6:11:44] chapoop_: @Bushcat94 came back negative

[6:11:46] jcbankx: just a question but have you got a chair?
[6:11:49] twopumpshow: so what if i had the cash on me. its not illegal to randomly walk somewhere and pickup cash off of the ground

[6:12:09] Caeros: don't all charges go to court? since it's innocent until proven guilty, the prosecution, which is the state, has to prove he's guilty before getting the fine?
[6:12:11] Bushcat94: @chapoop_  thanks bro

[6:14:02] Caeros: @Caeros oh ok true. so in the state's eyes he's already guity

[6:14:37] theredfrosts: Why would they not allow it?
[6:14:38] Spartoriius: flashlight'
[6:14:41] theslip: robbery of a government employee isnt a charge?
[6:14:42] albertwinsford: unless the flashlight has a inventory tag / serial number... anyone should be able to buy a flashlight thats a bit of a powergaming move saying only PD have them LUL
[6:14:43] feraldog7: ok nvm

[6:15:34] audy: how would she know is getting robbed LUL
[6:15:36] grntcr: @albertwinsford yeah, I think they agreed that it's only available to PD but for RP purposes it isn't PD equipment
[6:15:43] zrynnn: @angel0fdeath2k because that would make the game way too easy if you could just twitch clip everything you see
[6:15:49] Eliminator_V: HUH
[6:15:56] MexiBrent: wait to push charges and talk to a captain, since you got 30 days

[6:16:13] albertwinsford: @Zunnun exactly thats just ass. why lock a flashlight behind govt its a flash light not a murder weapon. stinks of power gaming.
[6:16:14] CoCoBananazz: Craine!!!!
[6:16:14] 1remos: in uk this wouldn’t even get sent to trial by cps… no cctv no body cam no witnesses apart from victim he said she said

[6:16:21] BDG_Toa676: 🤔
[6:16:22] reallyreallybadatgames: robbing an officer is cheap, everybody should do it
[6:16:22] minilew1: Put him on bail LUL
[6:16:23] jaydenL0303: but she can say thats the flash light she was using
[6:16:24] Trixcross: no you don't need to prove it, the officer's statement should be enough to say "I had it, they robbed me, I didn't have it. he clearly possessed it"
[6:16:25] xShiryu23: shiiit so all we gotta do is rob a cop for thier gun toss it behind somehwere and only a 2k fine. hell yeah
[6:16:27] audy: just a regular flashlight

[6:16:35] Zunnun: @zackraore i am just speaking facts but go off buddy
[6:16:39] Caeros: @audy KEKLEO has to rp that he went through her pockets and holster
[6:16:42] zrynnn: id say push it and let the judge take it off
[6:16:43] minilew1: Everyone gonna be robbing cops now for 2k fine
[6:16:48] DieterK: chat what's her stream?
[6:16:49] feraldog7: @Trixcross cop sold it herself and is framing a random guy
[6:16:52] theredfrosts: @xshiryu23 Yeah serious bullshit.
[6:17:00] dammty1: problem is u cant charge for possesion if he doesnt have it on him
[6:17:02] more_parrots: ocean dump inc o7
[6:17:03] Scully_18: they literally caused terrorism in the city
[6:17:03] abdirahmanmomo: unlucky better luck NEXT TIME

[6:17:22] R5F_: a losing case ngl

[6:17:24] audy: take your small Ws
[6:17:33] Pepsi2g: theres no accessory to possession
[6:17:35] Real_Bugz: she’s right
[6:17:35] Trixcross: @feraldog7 the court won't believe that. he statement should be believed she's a cop
[6:17:38] Zunnun: Only reason
[6:17:41] 1remos: police need body cams for this exact reason. there a public servant at the end of the day
[6:17:41] Trixcross: *her
[6:17:43] xkill3rxfand: will tyrone get more time if he escapes
[6:17:43] ll_Adam_ll: that isn't double jeopardy
[6:17:46] zackraore: Possession charge used to be only applicable when he is in possession in 3.0 as far as I remember
[6:17:48] DanLGG: possessing stolen property?
[6:17:56] xShiryu23: Where is officer andrews when you need him
[6:17:58] oppositeattractive: is there anything about distribution of stolen property?
[6:18:04] feraldog7: cops statements should not hold more power than the civilians
[6:18:05] JonTudor: got rid of stolen property
[6:18:05] toxicnoob91: Technically it's possession of stolen goods because the flash lights stolen
[6:18:08] xkill3rxfand: will tyrone get more time if he escape

[6:18:10] JANEOTZ: did she say he rob with no mask but can do -30k ? i am Deadass right now.
[6:18:19] zac4e: She witnessed him possessing it tho? Or is that not enough?
[6:18:22] JoshDaDad: hopefully this don’t look bad on you from your bosses
[6:18:23] Goindeeptv: why cant you charge two people with possession of the same item if they did both.... posses the property?
[6:18:28] combattingjosh: @Zunnun don't get why you haven't started earlier tbh KEKW
[6:18:29] theredfrosts: I mean there is robbing a cop. stealing pd equipment. Intimidating a govt employee.
[6:18:40] Pepsi2g: @toxicnoob91 cant neccessarily prove it though, its a flash light and if you really think realistically a flashlight is a normal item
[6:18:46] zrynnn: not doing the government equipment one?
[6:18:50] theredfrosts: not listening to the commands of a peace officer right?
[6:18:50] combattingjosh: people just can't help themselves and think they know better
[6:18:54] dammty1: denzel tryna get that 10 percent moeny

[6:19:57] R5F_: you will lose this man
[6:20:05] Trixcross: the only reason other cases haven't been won on the cop's statement is because they weren't clear in their report. there should be no way the court doesn't believe he possessed the glock at one point
[6:20:12] Rascal_PM: You have to take these loses now to improve the situations long term

[6:20:33] 1remos: it’s not what u know. it’s what you can prove
[6:20:38] dammty1: @Deansocool  problem is by doing this and taking it to court u  will probably drop the possesion and other charges to
[6:20:39] Spikey770: fax
[6:20:41] SeaOfEmpty: It would set a crazy precedent if it's not charged I think
[6:20:43] sean019822: TYRONE DIEING OF STARVATION BRO
[6:20:43] Dumi90: true he didnt use a mask it should be 100% guilty on all charges
[6:20:45] combattingjosh: @JANEOTZ It's already happening. It's only going to get worse.
[6:20:46] R5F_: its possession but idk its your choice
[6:20:47] amarnirio23: how ya gonna get the gun back lad
[6:20:48] Trixcross: cop's statement is proof tho
[6:20:50] l14m_081195x: Go see ty he's gonnaadie
[6:20:53] Zunnun: @thefmhatter1986 hmm?
[6:20:54] FelQueen: ease win for cops
[6:21:00] lajmenno: technically it just states possession, doesn't clarify timeframe so if you got definitive proof for a point in time it could stick or the wording might change
[6:21:03] Khytran: I think you'd have a chance at it because articulating and getting a guilty verdict on the robbery corroborates proof or at least decision that he was in possession of the gun.
[6:21:07] Zunnun: Opinions*
[6:21:09] LukeH1992: you will lose on the position charge 100%
[6:21:14] minilew1: He was in the area as well
[6:21:18] theredfrosts: @minilew1 Yeah hope the gods are watching. because this will be the easiest way to rob cops. and get guns.
[6:21:18] combattingjosh: @gamerzz19 Trade the gun for food EZ

[6:21:24] grntcr: Cop statement is evidence, not proof
[6:21:24] Dalzino: @gamerzz19 brudda aree you okay
[6:21:25] feraldog7: prove he tossed it tho
[6:21:27] JANEOTZ: i am Deadass right now.NAHH no way.
[6:21:29] SeaOfEmpty: Beyond a reasonable doubt is the standard
[6:21:31] Rascal_PM: it would be much easier if you had the flashlight listed as a "PD Issues Flashlight"
[6:21:34] callumlfc122: where is the weapon though
[6:21:34] reno078: Ramee for the win
[6:21:38] oppositeattractive: does the possession charge note anything about previously possessing also?
[6:21:40] martinkmd1: what’s going on
[6:21:43] JoshDaDad: I doubt possession because you didn’t catch him with it
[6:21:45] DrWings87: Ruth is going to let them go scot free.
[6:21:46] minilew1: You need to set a precident
[6:21:46] MasNLFC: Betta Ring Ramee
[6:21:49] cello_gus: the other question is if you find the PD glock can you stick that person with possession?
[6:21:50] Ecesiss: ngl u mightve just leaked
[6:21:55] twopumpshow: picking up money off of the ground isn't illegal and having money on me isnt illegal
[6:22:00] dammty1: not tryna be harsh but the chances of getting posession to stick is 0.00001 percent
[6:22:02] TheMah1337: could give a tampering with evidence since he got rid of the gun
[6:22:03] willjb123: @chaperzz98 bro shut up about helping Tyrone. It's meta

[6:23:14] MexiBrent: why push charges when you have 30 days to talk to a lawyer and captains about the best way to go about it.
[6:23:15] Dalzino: @cello_gus not unless you can prove they were in possession at one point
[6:23:19] oppositeattractive: have you done a setup tour since you moved your desk?
[6:23:20] theredfrosts: I wish the cop who got robbed would be a little more forthcoming and not so scared to say yeah he took the gun out of my holster.

[6:37:03] Rascal_PM: @akhil1827 not saying he got robbed, hes just been taken to bench many times
[6:37:06] DanLGG: do you have evidence that he did possess the gun?
[6:37:22] feraldog7: cornwood also has a history of getting mad OOC and being a bich
[6:37:22] theredfrosts: Cheer100 would proof not be she felt it out of the holster like being taken right? because she was not knocked out or anything right?
[6:37:28] xkill3rxfand: is ty free to go?

[6:37:40] mortuusintus12: @ciassicciutch no, just her report is all they have. so its gonna be his word against hers
[6:37:43] Rascal_PM: he took the money that was left for exchange for the gun directly
[6:37:45] cello_gus: it's circumstantial but it's worth a shot
[6:37:46] Zunnun: @danlgg louise statement and taking the money
[6:37:49] Pepsi2g: i think you have enough for the two charges just not the possession charge
[6:37:51] Rascal_PM: that could be spun as admission of having the gun
[6:37:54] audy: this backfires tho no?
[6:37:54] WeirdestYeti: mj space jam reach :D rammee will even take the case?
[6:37:54] SuuWasTaken: He was faceID'd by an officer due to not wearing a mask and got caught in the sting. honestly its a pretty solid case

[6:38:14] ciassicciutch: where is the body cams or Vehicle cams 4.0?
[6:38:15] YungKingUtch: that beyond reasonable doubt
[6:38:21] Zunnun: @gaulty33 he haven't seen Louise on cop she is really good
[6:38:25] SuuWasTaken: its hella beyond reasonable doubt
[6:38:28] zrynnn: i think the possession will get dropped and the extortion will get lowered to accomplice/accessory since theres no proof he was the one on the phone
[6:38:32] audy: It would be nicer if nothing was on the line tbf but good luck den
[6:38:33] Rascal_PM: That should be in the report, that he took the specific amount of cash in exchange for the gun
[6:38:39] cello_gus: if it goes to trial you should press as many charges possible  this early on so you can see how charges stick under what precedence
[6:38:41] YungKingUtch: they gotta reach to defend all that
[6:38:43] mortuusintus12: ramee would trash this one if on his side. Sheisty is just too smart to pay the retainer way way way way ahead
[6:38:47] DanLGG: He had her flashlight when he was arrested as well. maybe get someone to testify how you can get a flashlight like pd Carry on the streets if you can
[6:38:49] ERiFERi112: what happens when they bring up that Louise was involved in the investigation of her own robbery?
[6:38:49] ciassicciutch: thought I’ve heard people say my body camera is running. but maybe I’m thinking of a different server
[6:38:51] SuuWasTaken: Louise is big W cop

[7:18:41] litlle_tiny_mouse: hahahha
[7:18:52] lajmenno: well, technically, if he don't contest the extortion, he "technically" admits to possession. Sure he can argue he was lying but, could work around that

[7:23:17] YungKingUtch: did you guys confirm that the money from the drop was gone?
[7:23:18] fubbes_93: there is no way u can charge someone with possesion just because u know he had it at some point in the past but it is not in possesion after arrest
[7:23:22] kundaimagz: he could change sims
[7:23:25] ChadoyEarle: @zunnun prediction? Ramee vs nekoda?

[8:07:14] qorzzz: bro you bout to get blasted by ramee for real.
[8:07:14] JJPowell73: I think its just a case of slowing everything down at that stage, you have control so just double check everything and speak to superiors if needed
[8:07:15] zac4e: Is 1181 referenced anywhere in 1182? Because if it is, you might be fucked on the "didnt know"
[8:07:15] clutchthose: @zunnun RT

[8:09:13] BalerionBlackDread: But there are 2 incidents
[8:09:18] DanLGG: Nah Denzel is doing Ramee a huge favor. Ramee knew legally he could not represent Snow because denzel has him on retainer. Denzel let him so he could make $25k
[8:09:21] undy97: did I miss the trial
[8:09:22] Rascal_PM: to be fair it is ok because if you find the guy with the firearm they would be tired to case 81
[8:09:34] beccarobertson93: Anyone know the judges @ please
[8:09:45] zrynnn: the extortion happened seperately from the robbery of Louise, thats why its 2 reports, they did not happen simultaneously, they are related but not the same incident.
