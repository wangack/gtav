[2:34:32] Ari_Karate: GPT 4.0 is better because it has a better way of understanding context vs 3.5 @Deansocool
[2:34:32] aceof_eights: can I join the grammerly now?
[2:34:33] SuuWasTaken: ChatGPT 4.0 is not free. ChatGPT 3.5 is free
[2:34:34] DisConfused: @kylew_tv gpt 3.5 is free, not 4.0
[2:34:35] ramsin50: he said he works at not runs the company

[2:34:37] xGotNoClout: @Deansocool I am a software developer and ChatGPT writes half my initial code then patch things together
[2:34:37] Zunnun: @bleu_starrr said it think but he said grammarly
[2:34:39] TheWilHD: TheWilHD subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 30 months! deansoLove2

[2:35:05] ShinJiHun: better ring ramos
[2:35:08] Zunnun: @shyguysg_ no deansoP
[2:35:12] mkirby11: chatgpt 4.0 uses live data instead of data from before a certain year
[2:35:25] chmbrs: wouldnt chat gpt add in things to fluff the report that didnt happen since its AI?
[2:35:26] Zunnun: ^
[2:35:42] Zunnun: Just keep chatgpt i guess
[2:35:46] BDG_Toa676: deansoCD
[2:35:47] SuuWasTaken: @mkirby11 Not true, the latest batch of info is from April 2023
[2:35:49] xGotNoClout: @xGotNoClout It is just google on steroids. Thankfully its not advanced enough to be used by non developers properly or we would be out of a job LUL
[2:35:49] renziboss: for a more wide range scope chatgpt
[2:35:49] KappaManJason: try both see which is better
[2:35:52] Scully_18: so painful
[2:35:53] aceof_eights: Chatgpt can Change it slightly
[2:35:57] ShinJiHun: Ramos = ChatGPT lawyer, Denzel = ChatGPT cop

[2:36:04] DrWetbone: just have cornball write reports for you

[2:36:09] ShyGuySG_: @Zunnun good i havent missed it deansoP
[2:36:11] captain_steve_420: Tyrone doesn't understand what evidence means
[2:36:11] marneraiders: I use both in med school, grammarly is better in correcting Punctuation and grammar, and ChatGPT is great for writing initial texts or analysing documents. @deansocool
[2:36:19] progressislife: this guy is reaching so far OMEGALUL
[2:36:22] kylew_tv: @DisConfused 4.0 free on the bing app
[2:36:26] Gachiguru: WOT
[2:36:28] Ari_Karate: @mkirby11 it's kind of true, kinda not. ChatGPT has a knowledge cutoff date itself, but 4.0 is able to go online and get realtime info that it does not know
[2:36:28] BDG_Toa676: Literalehhh
[2:36:29] leo_bwo: this guy is cooked lol

[2:37:02] Ari_Karate: @renziboss copilot I think
[2:37:02] SuuWasTaken: @Deansocool i think chatgpt 4.0 is better for what you want to do with it, but it takes some time to learn how to properly do the prompts
[2:37:06] B__M__C: maaan I understand this crim is RPing this out but it's sooo tedius to hear him say the same irrelevant shit over and over for ages
[2:37:08] hey_buff: More negative account
[2:37:08] Money2Much: LULW
[2:37:10] captain_steve_420: Tyrone thinks he's dealing with UK cops

[2:37:12] Peppermint_Wizard: Turner gets shit done
[2:37:13] eaglezFly: i feel bad for him
[2:37:13] m4l1kkk: He has to learn rat strats and negotiation skills

[2:37:24] Money2Much: finally
[2:37:26] xGotNoClout: @Deansocool ChatGPT you can enter bullet points for what happened and it will generate the entire statement for you
[2:37:29] erzahlen: for what
[2:37:33] Money2Much: just use chat gpt super good

[2:37:39] Gachiguru: OMEGALUL
[2:37:42] MDM4ever1986HD: Does Grammarly have chatGPT added?
[2:37:43] 9trashpanda9: rammee uses 3.5 and it seems to be solid for technical writing
[2:37:44] AbeFroman2: does he have to be so difficult
[2:37:46] jkb_xD: cops in 3.0 got in trouble for using chatgpt
[2:37:47] AlienatedFL: NGL I thought of using Chat GPT
[2:37:49] BDG_parth28: @eaglezfly  Turner has overstayed 2 extra hrs poor don LUL
[2:37:50] AlienatedFL: for reprots

[2:38:00] mkirby11: @ari_karate I thought I was sort of correct üòÇüëçüèº
[2:38:02] SuuWasTaken: Bullet points -> let chatgpt generate report -> put report in grammarly EZ
[2:38:07] xacticz1: ?
[2:38:12] AlienatedFL: Wait are cops allowed to use ChatGPT???
[2:38:17] ShinJiHun: oop
[2:38:18] SuuWasTaken: @AlienatedFL ofc
[2:38:25] devlin0221: lol
[2:38:28] m4l1kkk: Just put it in his mouth
[2:38:29] var1sc: British

[2:38:39] jexjex1: no
[2:38:40] talgach: Shruge
[2:38:42] ShinJiHun: probably not
[2:38:42] Rascal_PM: he said respectfully shut up
[2:38:42] devlin0221: 50 minutes
[2:38:43] Frappachino: probably not
[2:38:43] fkingjagaloon: its hard cause we do reports on an mdt
[2:38:45] ShinJiHun: privacy concerns
[2:38:45] xsilas43: whos gonna stop them KEKW
[2:38:46] Toxcicle: Sounds like a question for Andrews
[2:38:46] MDM4ever1986HD: Shruge

[2:38:47] talgach: ionno i would LMFAO
[2:38:47] mizzikk2401: everyone uses it for help
[2:38:48] pacman1379: Probably because the information is sensitive
[2:38:48] xdj5x: Depend
[2:38:48] Rascal_PM: NOT ANYMORE
[2:38:50] xDeadLife_RS: Depends on policy
[2:38:51] SantaSkaarr: it aint english class
[2:38:52] fkingjagaloon: cant really download soft ware on it
[2:38:52] DrWetbone: ‚Äúallowed‚Äù?
[2:38:55] AbeFroman2: he'd have been out by now if he complied
[2:38:56] Crispy_Auto: Shruge
[2:38:56] 0o0matt0o0: do they ask it if the crim did something illegal lol
[2:38:58] Athasin: @xGotNoClout He's gonna use grammerly to make what he sends to ChatGPT coherent
[2:38:58] DanLGG: yes but they have to edit it to make sure it‚Äôs accurate
[2:39:00] m4l1kkk: Not if it contains confidential information that could be used for model training purposes
[2:39:00] BDG_Toa676: deansoPopcorn deansoPopcorn
[2:39:01] Peppermint_Wizard: That's a question for Tony Andrews probably
[2:39:01] 117Pizza: No they aren‚Äôt only use for punctuation
[2:39:01] Spr1ggs: I don't see what would stop them from rewriting some reports with chatgpt to fix grammar and shit tbh
[2:39:01] ShinJiHun: Ask Andrews
[2:39:03] Hypo_: It's an information security issue
[2:39:05] Frappachino: email andrews LUL
[2:39:07] marneraiders: For Open source intelligence probably yes, for statements and report probably not.
[2:39:12] ali_101299: that officer is jarring
[2:39:12] SuuWasTaken: @AlienatedFL it does not give you any advantage over anyone else. the most important thing is that the report is complete. completeness is based on what input you give it
[2:39:15] mizzikk2401: yeah ask andrews
[2:39:21] Toluen090: Not sure some companies do and some don't. Problem is it opens information to public domain as the ai learns
[2:39:24] fkingjagaloon: i run my shit through word to fix typos
[2:39:24] lxuannnnnnnnnn: prohibited to use chatgpt cause it's considered a breach of information
[2:39:32] m4l1kkk: They would lose their jobs if they entered sensitive information into models that collect information for training
[2:39:32] Rascal_PM: there‚Äôs a big debate about this lawyers are passing rules that they cannot use AI for legal documentation.
[2:39:36] Toluen090: Not sure about federal and local government types
[2:39:39] remmy_6: prob. not allowed but as long as u dont get caught using it
[2:39:40] jkb_xD: probabvly  best to ask saab out of anyone.
[2:39:44] pacman1379: Shit not eve 6FT
[2:39:45] remmy_6: ome5
[2:39:46] AlienatedFL: @SuuWasTaken Trust me I understand the arguement for it, i'm trying to ask fi the admins have random rules against it
[2:39:46] MOIKAPY: good morning, everyone!

[2:40:25] CowsAndStuff: 5'8"
[2:40:26] n8dogg03: MrDestructoid cant stop us all
[2:40:27] Ari_Karate: police IRL probably have an in-house GPT that is not public
[2:40:28] sojurma: he needs a mentor fr
[2:40:30] CalculatedRH: Basically every company that used confidential or personal information has a "No AI" Policy
[2:40:31] chmbrs: bro is 5'8 LUL
[2:40:31] JeePecks: I work as a software engineer and we use it all the time under the radar KEKW
[2:40:33] devlin0221: shorty
[2:40:33] Spr1ggs: my job is encouraging us to use ai OMEGALUL
[2:40:35] TheWilHD: I cannot use ChatGPT at work too but can use CoPilot, make it make sense
[2:40:36] Troytd: deansoF deansoF
[2:40:37] ScreenFresh: if you do chatgpt and proofread then whats the problem
[2:40:38] ShinJiHun: There was a lawyer that got absolutely fucked getting caught using ChatGPT
[2:40:42] renziboss: is that flippy omg
[2:40:46] MOIKAPY: @Rascal_PM danggggg, thats lame.  sono chatgpt? could you make your own ai? its opensource
[2:40:49] Frappachino: probably not true
[2:40:50] SuuWasTaken: @AlienatedFL none that are public atleast, same argument could be made for photoshop for event pictures on twatter or grammarly for other officers
[2:40:53] Toluen090: Chatgpt is considered public which can share sensitive data and information inpu to it
[2:40:57] PixelSeanTV: LUL LUL LUL LUL
[2:41:04] DanLGG: Tyrone really relying on the ‚Äúno evidence‚Äù
[2:41:04] AbeFroman2: LUL
[2:41:08] spicyville: If I worked somewhere where they said don't use chatGPT I would simply quit
[2:41:09] lxuannnnnnnnnn: you just use it as a reference and not tell honestly
[2:41:10] Toluen090: So privileged information can be at risk
[2:41:10] pacman1379: should add that in his profiel
[2:41:12] n8dogg03: i use it al the time for emails and edit it to work
[2:41:12] demialy: question tho if she‚Äôs the victim in both cases why is she leading the case and doing house raids etc
[2:41:13] hey_buff: In my job i use the ia under the desk
[2:41:14] armedgolem01: using ai should be fine if u check it after
[2:41:15] j0Ity: I can use chatgpt at work but I prefer to use my own words, and just use the ai for hints
[2:41:16] aceof_eights: @Rascal_PM Wasn't there a big legal case were somebody used it and it cited a fictional case
[2:41:20] LukeH1992: a lot of call centres use AI now
[2:41:22] xsilas43: KEKW
[2:41:23] fkingjagaloon: really no need to use reports are easy especially when youve written so many
[2:41:24] boombakllava: it‚Äôs frowned upon for plagiarism u
[2:41:29] Sparklzx: My uni encourages AI too, it's IT tho
[2:41:30] xGotNoClout: @xGotNoClout Seems like a waste. Grammarly is better for that but isn't needed. Honestly tempted to make a custom ChatGPT to generate statements which make sure the reason for the charges are accurate.
[2:41:31] BDG_Toa676: deansoSmoke deansoSmoke deansoSmoke
[2:41:42] MOIKAPY: @Toluen090 true, but there are open-sourced versions that you can build and info/data is stored locally
[2:41:43] ShinJiHun: @spicyville Conversely, if an employee couldn't do their job without having to rely on ChatGPT, they should probably be fired LUL
[2:41:46] dylanconlon6: I could see den zel and Louise in a relationship

[2:44:03] MDM4ever1986HD: So there instances where you can use ChatGPT like non-law statements?
[2:44:08] EGGZOLENTZ: Aint that only if u plea guilty
[2:44:14] xGotNoClout: @Rascal_PM Yep, ChatGPT still makes a lot of mistakes that someone with no experience wouldn't understand.
[2:44:16] armedgolem01: id do no time off hes the reason its taken so long lol
[2:44:21] eatcheese0: @Athasin thanks!

[2:44:33] Th3Ch0: How do you guyw get air 1? Purchase or admins have to add it??

[2:58:33] Gulkai: yep
[2:58:33] Bombasticbaboon: its fucking 10 if you steal it
[2:58:37] m4l1kkk: You're the cop, buddy, not us
[2:58:39] slickrick_77: either way the bags are state property, no?
[2:58:39] dmurray01_: yeah
[2:58:41] adrian_md46: we are not cops KEKW
[2:58:42] ramsin50: its 30 rolls a bag thats why
[2:58:43] KillaKH0le: Doesnt it depend on the value of stolen goods?
[2:58:43] EGGZOLENTZ: Yeah i would say so
[2:58:43] Luthercorpz: I don't see what consists of robbery at all then LUL They drive armored trucks
[2:58:44] Bombasticbaboon: 10 dollars surely petty theft
[2:58:44] zap_rowsdower_42: the driver doesnt own the bags
[2:58:45] Crispy_Auto: @Crispy_Auto Yoo dap me up for the knowledge drop
[2:58:45] jexjex1: yeah its still the banks money
[2:58:45] MDM4ever1986HD: it's up to you Dean
[2:58:49] RonJon: it doesn't matter where they came from it matters where YOU took them from
[2:58:49] pacman1379: Bags dont belong to the driver
[2:58:50] aleman98: @Deansocool they can get the bags from normal stores
[2:58:51] jexjex1: they are only moving it
[2:58:52] Tsithik: Ask a lawyer or judge
[2:58:55] dmurray01_: petty theft would be like senior buns
[2:58:56] MDM4ever1986HD: we're not cops you are
[2:58:56] pacman1379: they belong to the bank stilll
[2:58:57] SuuWasTaken: Yoo
[2:58:58] zehel_k: I think its more on "who" and "where" you're robbing from?
[2:58:58] chillmace: +1 dap for confusion
[2:59:01] Clodhoppr: i'd think it would be robbery as it is transport of money from business to banksafe
[2:59:03] entvidya: do what your captain says even if it doesn't make sense
[2:59:03] zap_rowsdower_42: its the banks money
[2:59:05] ryanshaw89: @deansocool how long did Tyrone get brother
[2:59:06] pacman1379: They are the transportation
[2:59:06] Athasin: Except they listed brick and mortar institutions NOT vehicles under the control of people
[2:59:09] Aaron__Kelly: Petty robbery more of a fine than robbery LUL
[2:59:11] Clodhoppr: but i guess depends on valuation of the money itself
[2:59:11] Jethrq: You finna be engaging in some DAPs real soon
[2:59:15] m4l1kkk: Bro is outsourcing his job out to us üòÇüò≠
[2:59:16] Trixcross: robbery is more about stealing from a property
[2:59:16] RonJon: they weren't taken from the bank by the robber tho
[2:59:19] AbeFroman2: ooooo
[2:59:20] Bombasticbaboon: tickets from snr buns are worth more lol.
[2:59:22] legobind: after they take the bags it goes from the banks money to g6 money

[3:00:18] adrian_md46: to your left d d d Denzel SCARED
[3:00:19] Astavexa: She is looking at you thats a DAp, O7
[3:00:20] Mickerson2: technically like robbing a money truck transporting money from one bank to another?
[3:00:24] Totikki: eaglezFly aight

[3:00:25] TintManRico: BE THE AVENGERS
[3:00:33] lord_wzrd: deansoStare ruth looking at you
[3:00:33] Xellwrath: The logic Turner used is wrong. The money belongs to the bank not the driver. The gun is owned by the manufacturer and being transported (using his example) therefore they're technically still robbing the bank even if its not at the bank physically.

[3:59:54] PsychoJoker: @SxtoruXL They basically speak to the council about what the Police need vehicle wise or weapon wise and speak for them in a manner that will convince the council to give them what they want

[4:00:17] jinnytolls: @johnnycolision That was after a few months of np3 no doubt
[4:00:18] Bubbles520: Or join Sheriff's department with Cornwood KKonaW
[4:00:23] Panos_97: Nekoda is the best for the position, he has connections everywhere

[4:01:03] Clodhoppr: officers only
[4:01:07] ImEmanGaming: steal

[4:01:21] KellBellnf: Some officers started too late, Bones only started campaigning like two days ago
[4:01:26] Aynese: I thought they were doing a liaison for each shift
[4:01:28] PsychoJoker: They basically speak for the PD as a whole on their needs
[4:01:31] jinnytolls: Technically the captains have a vote too, they can fire the liason from their regular job and thus no longer a laison
[4:01:35] Panos_97: To be fair, Nekoda represents the PD as a whole, not Denzel
[4:01:50] jackeycobra: Why isn't denzel running?
[4:01:50] AbeFroman2: so does maple though
[4:01:53] Panos_97: So the shift doesn't matter much
[4:01:56] LJD420: nikota the homie
[4:01:57] AbeFroman2: but denz vote would goto nekota
[4:02:05] Clodhoppr: he has Nekoda's ear basically
[4:02:08] bobbybeee: a good rapport
[4:02:09] venomag_: what are they campaigning for ?
[4:02:14] Panos_97: @Deansocool I get what you mean but I doubt you will be able to influence him much
[4:02:18] ramsin50: i think he was asking about the position
[4:02:20] irmatt2: are you going to check what the suspect threw on the ground?
[4:02:24] AbeFroman2: yeah makes sense denz vote goes to someone on his shift
[4:02:27] AlienatedFL: playing politics
[4:02:32] Panos_97: Agreed on that
[4:02:33] jinxedrng: to bad cornwoods not shooting for mayor
[4:02:37] bobbybeee: he has almost the same views
[4:02:39] BerryG_333: Pred or Wrangler would pursue charges for ending chases early
[4:02:46] kingceejay90: im confused how the chatter is confused
[4:02:51] kingceejay90: it makes 100$ sense
[4:02:53] ImEmanGaming: voice crack but nobody peeped Kappa
[4:02:53] Panos_97: Den and Nekoda agree on pretty much all issues so far
[4:02:54] MexiBrent: he would probably change when he comes around to match the mayor
[4:02:54] kingceejay90: 100%
[4:03:04] sonadapop: @jinxedrng cornwood is needed in the PD
[4:03:07] talgach: Nekoda always understood you and had similar mindset as you also
[4:03:20] Jethrq: Maple stuck in da tree obviously
[4:03:23] sonadapop: Max wants there to be balance between cop and crim
[4:03:24] blackops567: maple on that syrup
[4:03:30] SoulYou_: i mean, Nekoda's decisions have to be influenced by other PO's opinions. Atr least it should work that way
[4:03:41] Jethrq: @blackops567 deansoF
[4:03:44] captain_steve_420: Maple and Aziz are bffs, better watch out
[4:03:52] talgach: on a real maple syrup is overrated
[4:03:55] DanLGG: Maple is aight but I feel like nekoda would fit the role better.
[4:04:01] j0k3rhub: who had that role in 3.0?
[4:04:02] jackeycobra: Vote for Joey

[4:23:25] Troytd: deansoF deansoF
[4:23:25] dino_zus: @deansocool they just banned stealing keys
[4:23:26] Kiwi_lul: imagine they robbing ur house and ur dogs maul them OMEGALUL
[4:23:26] BDG_Toa676: Her accent I can't deansoF
[4:23:27] Athasin: @HaychSD Nah how Eugene is handling the Company trying to rob him proves it's not too easy to avoid being robbed
[4:23:29] AbeFroman2: ah ok so hes not in trouble
[4:23:32] hartleyq10: whats the rule?
[4:23:33] ramsin50: but this kinda ruins the fun for people
[4:23:35] Dream_Canceled: They need to find a balance
[4:23:36] Baileybrad: yes @haychsd had to be banned to easy to make 100k
[4:23:39] GoodGuyAwad: what rule
[4:23:39] BDG_Toa676: Fan fan is dope
[4:23:39] HarryPatel: so you can still rob people but cant take keys right?
[4:23:40] Î∏åÎ†åÌä∏: what does the rule say
[4:23:41] MasNLFC: What is the rule?
[4:23:42] f0rbin: so what's the bug?
[4:23:44] HaychSD: @HaychSD Not everyone is as smart as Eugene :D
[4:23:44] scootypebbles92: @Rascal_PM Why would they not allow this lol
[4:23:47] wtheredaway: So when we getting honeycomb bases LUL
[4:23:47] oM4J: wait thats 5head ur character having a "forced" voice then when ur robbing sm1 u talk normally 5head
[4:23:48] Scoo73r: It's a good rule
[4:23:50] talgach: @hartleyq10 no house robberies until further notice
[4:23:56] JazzPimp: No shot the hoa didnt hop in their van and chase
[4:23:57] SuuWasTaken: this is too OP due to how long it takes to make money and lack of guns
[4:23:58] chapszz: no keys or house robbings
[4:24:03] JazzPimp: truck
[4:24:05] Sempathyy: The discord basically says no more house robberies until further notice
[4:24:05] nationas: wait why
[4:24:05] Coldsteeze: whaat
[4:24:09] DannyL3tscher: ahh makes sense, they probably need some level of home security added
[4:24:13] 1CaptainRedBeard1: They'll probably try to introduce a mechanic for it.
[4:24:14] KloperR: Can you kidnap them and force them to open the house for you ? @Deansocool
[4:24:16] 1CaptainRedBeard1: Because this is really easy'
[4:24:17] n8dogg03: they cant figure out how to tag names to house keys
[4:24:18] spicyville: probably because of this lol
[4:24:20] Athasin: @HaychSD I take back everything I just said, they obviously were dumb if they didn't think people would steal physical keys
[4:24:21] red_eyed_jed1: why would they change a rule like that with no rp
[4:24:22] jaemynn: @Deansocool I mean this is like -3 days of work
[4:24:23] BDG_parth28: Its scuff rn thats why
[4:24:32] AbeFroman2: it took a lot of effort for what they stole thats why lol
[4:24:33] Lord_Legolas: Yeager is on they ass rn
[4:24:34] BDG_parth28: Sometimes shit isn't working properly
[4:24:34] nationas: ahh
[4:24:35] nationas: okay
[4:24:37] Rascal_PM: @scootypebbles92 They have had safezones in NoPixel before. Just like you shouldnt kill people in the hospital, it leads to powergaming
[4:24:40] JazzPimp: bro why does hades not go after
[4:24:43] HaychSD: @HaychSD I sense some sarxasm lmao
[4:24:45] MexiBrent: i mean he has a gun
[4:24:45] Athasin: Chase a guy with a gun
[4:24:45] BDG_Toa676: Deeeeeeeeeeevious
[4:24:46] HaychSD: Sarcasm*
[4:24:46] Î∏åÎ†åÌä∏: @red_eyed_jed1 sounds like a temp hotfix
[4:24:46] ImEmanGaming: I would‚Äôve spun back
[4:24:47] ihateonions: they have a gun
[4:24:47] BDG_parth28: So that's why it's been put until further notice
[4:24:48] MisterParry: The new rule is going to change the power imbalance between The Company and Jason's crew
[4:24:48] Kiwi_lul: IT IS RUST
[4:24:48] JeePecks: Eeeesashshs
[4:24:50] ImEmanGaming: deansoDemon
[4:24:50] DanLGG: that set them back a whole ass week
[4:24:51] JeePecks: Tough world
[4:24:52] SuuWasTaken: @jaemynn 100k is more than 3 days right
[4:24:52] 1CaptainRedBeard1: Because it is. lol
[4:24:53] LJD420: i like you can still rob houses just not their keys which seems fair tbh
[4:24:54] mofoloco1: this is like full days tooo full 24 hous of game play
[4:24:56] TMakBC: 100K pluss
[4:24:56] Is_a_Red: there was another house robbery earlier too
[4:24:57] eaglezFly: that was way more than 3 days is it not
[4:24:58] Tsithik: They'll find a way to make it work robbery is the staple of the game
[4:24:58] slymox: K was worried about it as he did it
[4:24:58] mofoloco1: 3 days
[4:24:59] yuidity: issa cruel world
[4:24:59] talgach: foundation wipe type shit
[4:25:01] BDG_Toa676: deansoP deansoP
[4:25:07] scootypebbles92: @Rascal_PM I'm sure once they get a system implemented to keep track of keys it will be allowed, no such thing as safe zones
[4:25:08] GoodGuyAwad: i would be hella mad
[4:25:09] Baileybrad: this isn‚Äôt even the worse one I‚Äôve seen some people just spammed the door and got in no key @deansocool
[4:25:10] julieannxox: yeah it does
[4:25:10] Enoobrac: bro you NEED to see other houses if you think that is rust
[4:25:11] MisterParry: A lot of houses are giving Rust
[4:25:12] just_ish: no pixel has so many rust streamers
[4:25:13] Is_a_Red: good thing they made that not allowed for now lmao
[4:25:13] zmarcus6: DayZ for me
[4:25:13] DanLGG: wait til you see Ks setup
[4:25:14] ItsSkaara: mr.k didn't even steal the materials
[4:25:15] xxTOPPExx: I mean one of the owners plays almost every twitch rivals rust so hmmm...prolly inspired by that lol
[4:25:15] AbeFroman2: closer to 200k probably
[4:25:15] jaemynn: @jaemynn not for hoa but for a normal grouip this is like a full wipe
[4:25:16] thebeast65678: dayz vibs
[4:25:16] hartleyq10: lol wait until you see the house plans getting put in right now lol
[4:25:19] Gachiguru: the house bases are gonna get super sweaty eventually with cop killing tunnels LULW
[4:25:20] ramsin50: and guns are very rare that makes it harder to defend your self
[4:25:20] nathanarmstrong0: Probably to also stop people who was scuffing into people house
[4:25:20] LukeH1992: you are not going to chase when they have a gun
[4:25:22] n8dogg03: gang gang
[4:25:23] sadegh127: its hurts like rust
[4:25:26] Athasin: @HaychSD No I'm serious, my original argument is that if they didn't want people to do this, they wouldn't make keys physical, but they made a rule meaning they didn't want people to do this
[4:25:26] mofoloco1: pretty much 72 hours of game play was stolen lol
[4:25:26] Panos_97: K ended the man's career LUL
[4:25:27] Enoobrac: some people are doing legit bug mechanics to get into rooms
[4:25:32] omascas: Lol is this why they banned stealing house keys??
[4:25:36] n8dogg03: that grind is tough
[4:25:38] Xarisher: @Gachiguru They already are
[4:25:38] Athasin: @Athasin So they must be dumb
[4:25:45] SuuWasTaken: @ramsin50 yeah nothing you can do to stop this. going against a gun would be NVL so its a weird situation
[4:25:49] AbeFroman2: look how many mats he took
[4:25:50] BDG_Toa676: GAMBA GAMBA deansoSpin
[4:25:51] patryk_3399: Pp
[4:25:52] slymox: K said he didn't want to keep or copy any keys because he said it felt too much like a Rust offline raid.
[4:25:53] joster124: @Deansocool mandem got robbed cuz their door was bugged they locked it but some people saw it open
[4:25:54] Ten_Ju: @omascas Ruins the game
[4:25:55] DanLGG: this shouldn‚Äôt be allowed for now. If you rob a cop then you got a gun and can take anything from anyone
[4:25:55] irmatt2: @nathanarmstrong0 mechanic scuff in to a house, ban
[4:25:56] LukeH1992: they have weed in there house they aint calling cops lol
[4:25:56] KloperR: Can you kidnap them and force them to open the house for you ? @Deansocool
[4:25:58] n8dogg03: 32 days of grinding  LUL
[4:25:59] Wicketw: it'd be fine if there were options to add more security but rn it's too easy to just camp someone for their key
[4:26:02] kayc_luv: kayc_luv subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! the stuff with Richard after was jokes and peanut is in icu it was crazy
[4:26:02] HaychSD: @HaychSD I don't disagree it should be possible, but there's little to no security right now right it's like you lose your key, you're done. End of
[4:26:03] Kiwi_lul: @Deansocool what makes it more like RUST is the fact that u can make fire pits and boobie traps in case u get robbed
[4:26:03] Vacmy: whose house was that?
[4:26:03] patryk_3399: Polish gang üáµüá±üáµüá±üáµüá±üáµüá±üáµüá±üòÅ
[4:26:04] DannyL3tscher: I think they need to setup home security that calls the cops for sure, similar to the local ones
[4:26:05] Athasin: @Athasin Because how do you make a key mechanic like this and not expect this outcome when games like Rust exists
[4:26:06] JazzPimp: YEA
[4:26:06] woolfdesign: LUL
[4:26:07] BDG_Toa676: 2 Ws deansoShake
[4:26:07] Rascal_PM: @scootypebbles92 the apartments and Hospitals were safe zones in nopixel and you can get banned for that in the past. its just part of the game bro chill
[4:26:10] ItsSkaara: EZ
[4:26:11] Panos_97: I think he's the richest guy in the server

[4:26:16] BDG_parth28: WWW resub
[4:26:18] f0rbin: so are they gonna get their shit back?
[4:26:18] ramsin50: you can't even call the cops because you have illegal stuff
[4:26:18] SuuWasTaken: but for how long
[4:26:18] R5F_: u need to worry about them 3 daps
[4:26:19] 0x000b: EZ

[4:28:13] chris2fourx: Stand your ground laws
[4:28:13] Flueoffdoom: ?
[4:28:15] AbeFroman2: they can just claim self defense right
[4:28:19] Athasin: @Athasin Like they have the mechanic where the owner can decide who can put furniture. So why not extend it to keys?
[4:28:21] mofoloco1: awesome content man im up in northern canada laid off with nothing to do and its -40 with 4 feet of snow outside your making this winter hilarious for me keep it up !!!!! thanks g
[4:28:21] BDG_Toa676: tips his hat @ flue
[4:28:22] Gachiguru: i dont think they want people just chain robbing player houses
[4:28:22] Rascal_PM: @chaosproductions Thats  probably the main problem, with the key system you can access their inventory when asleep
[4:28:22] DanLGG: you can‚Äôt offline raid unless you have a key. I kinda hope they disable to key copier thing
[4:28:23] TheKingOfWit: i hear people say stand your ground, but idk how los santos owrks
[4:28:26] Ten_Ju: Not yet but yung dab will pass it
[4:28:27] 1CaptainRedBeard1: There needs to be.
[4:28:28] HaychSD: @HaychSD The principle is there - I think they just need to fine tune it a little better. Instead of like keys = everything.
[4:28:34] CeeJayySeven: how long do warrants last before they go away officer?
[4:28:41] n8dogg03: they wont convict if you shot someone breaking into your house
[4:28:43] Dondave19: no there ain‚Äôt vinny lost
[4:28:48] Flueoffdoom: @CeeJayySeven its occifer omE
[4:28:49] chaosproductions: @Rascal_PM yeah thats total BS
[4:28:49] tr0kgaming: Difficult though when its knife on knife or gun on knife it gets tricky
[4:28:54] Ten_Ju: Yes, self defense
[4:28:54] AbeFroman2: does that not count under self defense
[4:28:55] BoldSlowbro: Gotta push for the laws to change
[4:28:57] Dondave19: not yet
[4:28:57] hexxtokez420: stand your ground.
[4:28:58] Kiwi_lul: @Deansocool they need to implement dogs fr
[4:28:58] TheKingOfWit: sure, stand your ground is proportional force
[4:29:01] koradoxxx: nope , just like in Canada :)
[4:29:05] SuuWasTaken: @Deansocool not against a gun, because then its like nvl
[4:29:05] SneakyFoxtrot: @Deansocool wouldn't that fall under self defense?
[4:29:07] 1CaptainRedBeard1: The problem is with the NVL rules it would be REALLY difficult.
[4:29:08] wtheredaway: Were at gunpoint anyways
[4:29:08] Rascal_PM: It would be NVL wouldnt it? if you dont have a Gun
[4:29:08] n8dogg03: stand your ground is different
[4:29:10] Athasin: @Dondave19 Vinny lost because there is no stand your ground for business
[4:29:10] socccergig: some group are pretty smart about hiding stuff
[4:29:14] DannyL3tscher: that's prolly what they're working on modifying before they let people rob houses again
[4:29:14] MOIKAPY: Castle Does
[4:29:16] hartleyq10: cant fight a guy with a gun tho
[4:29:18] AbeFroman2: ohhh stand your ground and castle are diff
[4:29:18] woolfdesign: NP just made it bannable to do this house robbing fuckery until further notice
[4:29:19] kyang026: Probably only in self defense if you are in the home, but that's not castle doctrine
[4:29:20] OiAM_Paka: castle law
[4:29:23] Athasin: They said not for business. Did they also say not for houses?
[4:29:26] TheKingOfWit: ok i understand
[4:29:26] Panos_97: How the fuck does he remember all these names
[4:29:26] Flueoffdoom: sus
[4:29:28] CeeJayySeven: occifer shiesty how long do warrants last before they expire sir?
[4:29:28] Enoobrac: Pistone got a Tahoe? damnnnn
[4:29:30] Superhank: is it poss to booby trap the houses?
[4:29:30] LukeH1992: yh but if your in your house then yh
[4:29:33] Rascal_PM: Until everyone has legal guns, it will be NVL if they defend themselves
[4:29:35] chaosproductions: ask ruth about a hypothetical like that? @Deansocool
[4:29:36] joel_alex: It also only exists in a few States
[4:29:39] woolfdesign: Check NP discord for deets
[4:29:40] Flueoffdoom: @CeeJayySeven i think 30 days
[4:29:43] hexxtokez420: right but if someone is coming at you to gain access into your home, I could see that falling into the same realm
[4:29:45] AbeFroman2: they can articulate that
[4:29:45] joel_alex: not a good example for a common law
[4:29:51] DanLGG: Theft is not a crime punishable by death.
[4:29:51] hexxtokez420: absolutely
[4:29:52] marneraiders: Hoe did they all get those nice cars suddenly ?
[4:29:55] CeeJayySeven: @Flueoffdoom DAMN 30 days?!
[4:29:57] joel_alex: In UK and Canada there is no stand your ground
[4:29:57] n8dogg03: castle soctrine is pretty all over the world i would think
[4:29:57] BoldSlowbro: 100 1042
[4:29:57] Rascal_PM: They would need legal guns in the server first
[4:29:58] artas3d: NOT if you live in the UK, n your house getting robbed you supposed to make the robbers a cup of tea and vacate the premises in an orderly fashion god forbid you assault the robber you go to prison LUL
[4:30:01] TheKingOfWit: depends on the jury?
[4:30:06] Athasin: Vinny got in trouble for protecting his BUSINESS, I don't think they said anything about houses
[4:30:06] DannyL3tscher: true you'd need legal firearms first
[4:30:08] joel_alex: only less than a dozen states.
[4:30:09] Flueoffdoom: YEET COURT
[4:30:13] beastly_kush: yes it‚Äôs your property you are able to protect yourself and your property
[4:30:18] TheKingOfWit: every case is unique in these situations
[4:30:19] BDG_Toa676: Yeet
[4:30:21] Rascal_PM: If you lose your gun license you wouldnt be able too defend yourself with a gun
[4:30:23] shramtots: Can we set u ptraps in police house incase it gets robbed?
[4:30:23] kennygo_: stand your ground just means you don't have the duty to flee
[4:30:26] tr0kgaming: What im interested to see is if traphouses cause charges for the owners if robbers go down in the house @Deansocool
[4:30:27] ramsin50: the robbers are armed so i would think yes
[4:30:28] AbeFroman2: why would stand your ground be location specific
[4:30:30] n8dogg03: come in my house youre dead. i dont care if its legal or not
[4:30:30] Athasin: @Deansocool If only Turner was your Capt. he would tell you without giving you a DAP
[4:30:38] chaosproductions: youd have to prove your case in court. if you can explain reasoning, you could win that case
[4:30:47] hexxtokez420: absolutely. so long as they were using physical aggression towards you and you had to defend your life. if they did what Mr K did, no.
[4:30:51] natalia6102: Hi testreeCharlie testreeNP
[4:30:59] JazzPimp: a good lawyer could say they are a threat to your life since theyre a malicious person in close proximity
[4:31:00] Athasin: @AbeFroman2 Because people were killing people for trying to rob their gruppe 6 and grime trucks
[4:31:01] MDM4ever1986HD: @natalia6102 peepoHey
[4:31:02] SneakyFoxtrot: Wtf are these ads this is my third set in the last 30 mins...
[4:31:06] TheKingOfWit: if you say you were terrified and they were coming at you, it's hard to prove that didn't happen
[4:31:06] DanLGG: absolutely not. you would have to be able to show they were trying to hurt you. I live in Ky and you open carry any gun any where but you can not shoot someone for stealing ur shit
[4:31:12] Athasin: @AbeFroman2 And then using stand your ground as a defense
[4:31:13] n8dogg03: Turbo EZ Clap
[4:31:13] boombakllava: prob not everyone would use it then
[4:31:32] xxlonegunmanxx: Self Defense
[4:31:38] AbeFroman2: i thought stand your ground is just if you as a person is threatend
[4:31:38] BarryEdwards: if they start it, its self defense
[4:31:43] DanLGG: An altercation would be yes.
[4:31:46] Athasin: @Athasin So the "city" said stand your ground doesn't count for businesses
[4:31:58] BDG_parth28: Trespassing ??!!
[4:31:58] MixtDeed: come to texas and florida lmfao
[4:31:59] DanLGG: If they walk in and grab your tv
[4:32:02] DarkestEmbers: Castle doctrine?
[4:32:04] MDM4ever1986HD: if you're robbing someone in their home you should be allowed to kill them yes?
[4:32:06] Vestfolding: Libtard City rules
[4:32:15] Athasin: @DarkestEmbers City doesn't seem to have one yet
[4:32:16] TraptPvP: yo chat. what happened to Tyrone ? anyone know the outcome? just tuned back in
[4:32:24] MDM4ever1986HD: I mean they should be allowed to kill you
[4:32:26] TheKingOfWit: well robbing someone is illegal, you need to have the cops stop them
[4:32:35] boombakllava: YEP
[4:32:36] f0rbin: but what about your shit?
[4:32:43] Superhank: chef em throw em in the trunk ocean drop EZ Clap
[4:32:44] DanLGG: nope. theft is not a crime punishable by death. you have to prove that was your only choice
[4:32:49] Daywalkerblade: I dunno someone robbing my house im grabbing my gun IRL
[4:32:59] mentorno_: bullshit
[4:33:02] 0x000b: ?
[4:33:04] zac4e: Citizens arrest?
[4:33:06] BarryEdwards: los santos is based on california
[4:33:07] Rascal_PM: @Vestfolding chill, i dont think you know how the law works man
[4:33:10] wtheredaway: Rip
[4:33:12] xEx1sT: you can not steal keys now
[4:33:12] AbeFroman2: there needs to be castle included
[4:33:15] AbeFroman2: thats all
[4:33:15] Chaimander: need some texas laws in LS
[4:33:16] TraptPvP: that‚Äôs los santos cali for you big dog. little Texas will be the shit
[4:33:16] AlienatedFL: NO right of REPLEVIN
[4:33:17] bb8799: will little texas have different laws?
[4:33:19] DanLGG: You can brandish and put them under citizens arrest.
[4:33:19] Nightmare_19xx: just gotta "articulate" that they charged at you
[4:33:20] ramsin50: can't you just threaten them?
[4:33:21] chaosproductions: low likelihood that the person being robbed has a gun to protect themselves anyways
[4:33:23] Ikotsu: just goes into use of deadly force reasons.
[4:33:25] Vestfolding: Literally San Fran rules
[4:33:28] AlienatedFL: the legal word is REPLEVIN
[4:33:30] DarkestEmbers: @BarryEdwards CA has castle doctrine, though
[4:33:33] AlienatedFL: taking your property back
[4:33:39] Athasin: @zac4e Stabbing someone/bashing them over the head with a wrench isn't arresting them
[4:33:40] TraptPvP: @bb8799 oh yeah. No laws in little Texas. shoot and ask questions later
[4:33:52] BDG_Toa676: deansoPopcorn deansoPopcorn
[4:33:57] Juvraj: they should add CCTV
[4:34:02] TheKingOfWit: it's people > property. if you can avoid damage to people it's more important than property. that's the logic
[4:34:08] Rascal_PM: @Vestfolding California and the US have different laws, but murder is not legal, self defense when necessary is
[4:34:10] zac4e: @Athasin I was thinking more like tackling them and beating them with fists
[4:34:13] toddthestarfox: so kill em and move the body or is there forensics
[4:34:14] DanLGG: @deansocool if they break in ur house and steal a gun then you can shoot them by saying you thought they were going to kill you
[4:34:16] BDG_Toa676: !flip
[4:34:16] AbeFroman2: you can get your shit back another way yeah
[4:34:17] chaosproductions: you need a case report to change the law
[4:34:24] hexxtokez420: that‚Äôs fucking crazy
[4:34:27] scairyterry: Where the coin flip tho?
[4:34:30] B__M__C: houses with multiple doors just fell by $100k
[4:34:38] Rascal_PM: They would need to allow murder in houses as a rule
[4:34:42] AbsolFC: coin flip africWait
[4:35:01] invalidskrrt: it was heads fr
[4:35:01] ooCORSAIRoo: classic Cali
[4:35:02] BDG_Toa676: What they call it Castle rules or some in the US
[4:35:08] Athasin: @zac4e Thing is, because there is no citizens handcuffing mechanic, tackling and beating is equivalent to beating someone near death, not just a simple assault
[4:35:12] BDG_parth28: HEAD deansoRNG deansoRNG deansoRNG deansoRNG
[4:35:16] AbeFroman2: castle is property yeah in US
[4:35:25] BDG_Toa676: Ahh
[4:35:27] AbsolFC: so no head?
[4:35:30] zac4e: @Athasin Ah true
[4:35:31] Athasin: @Athasin That said, the person you're tackling and beating most likely will have a knife so that's a death sentence for you
[4:35:31] AlienatedFL: I wonder how they will balance home invasions
[4:35:33] battmann_85: House robberies banable now
[4:35:36] AbeFroman2: only some states have castle though
[4:35:40] AlienatedFL: You can already stash a key
[4:35:47] combattingjosh: jump out the window no?
[4:35:50] BDG_parth28: deansoWeird
[4:35:51] Juvraj: it's tails
[4:35:55] Rascal_PM: Thats the problem with using real laws for a game, not everything will apply
[4:35:56] Athasin: @Athasin And if you pull a knife because they pulled a knife you get in trouble for not leaving because there is no stand your ground
[4:36:02] HarryPatel: no
[4:36:05] BDG_Toa676: deansoCD

[4:36:27] BDG_Toa676: Oh shit
[4:36:27] Luthercorpz: I couldnt imagine living in a place where ppl could just break into your house have the option to murder you take all ur shit an you legally cant do anything LUL
[4:36:28] BDG_parth28: Oh lord
[4:36:29] DanLGG: Back in the 90s A KY state trooper told my uncle to drag a thief‚Äôs body in the house before he called 911 if he ever shot him because shooting someone who is just stealing ur stuff is still murder. If they come in you can say you feel threatened
[4:36:32] Vision_ZA217: anyone gonna flip deansoFro

[4:37:02] DanLGG: make Suarez take the shot

[4:46:30] revenueprofit: @athasin what was the rule change
[4:46:31] vilosacrapter: hi dean buddhaH
[4:46:31] DanLGG: surge protector doesn‚Äôt prevent everything. some outlets can still fry
[4:46:37] hydalann: If you had a surge you may have to replace the protectors?
[4:46:39] HarryPatel: what happens? like it shuts off completely
[4:46:44] Athasin: @revenueprofit You can no longer steal keys
[4:46:45] wetsockss: i mean it can damage any internal component that may not immediately go bad, might work on and off until it dies
[4:46:46] Fi7Plays: i swear u always get unlucky with these pc issues and shit
[4:46:47] xxlonegunmanxx: It sounds like a capacitor in the camera was blown out
[4:46:48] vilosacrapter: and chat buddhaFlower
[4:46:49] quaylewastaken: You said you camera hot
[4:46:55] invalidskrrt: @Deansocool have you checked the canya on the camera??
[4:46:57] bb8799: i have instances of ports going bad through power outages.
[4:46:59] RoninSisu: Are you running off a power supply or a battery pack?
[4:47:04] Hithgor_: overheating?
[4:47:04] BDG_Toa676: Ello Vilo
[4:47:04] Just_CRM: Sounds like its fried the cam link adapter
[4:47:05] Frog69: lost 2 pc's and a 70in tv cuz power surge Sadge
[4:47:07] Athasin: @Athasin Therefore, no more house robberies due to key theft
[4:47:08] quaylewastaken: It's over heating you said that yesterday
[4:47:10] LukeH1992: what are you doing to get it to work when it goes off?
[4:47:12] ooCORSAIRoo: flux capacitor is going bad
[4:47:14] Lord_Legolas: @Athasin Mr K robbed Yeager, it was Yeager's house
[4:47:15] tacwombat: it doesnt have to be on if it was plugged in
[4:47:15] DanLGG: was the PC off?
[4:47:17] BDG_parth28: @vilosacrapter deansoHi deansoHi deansoHeart2
[4:47:18] avoidschickens: get a small UPS to put in between, it'll take the surges and protect equipment behind it
[4:47:19] wellie2404: 
[4:47:30] RoninSisu: The dummy batteries go bad fast
[4:47:30] kb420ps: You need a Furman Voltage Line Conditioner.
[4:47:34] SoulYou_: its always bad for PCs
[4:47:36] bobbybeee: imo, i'd have switched it all off. unplugged if you knew
[4:47:44] xxlonegunmanxx: the Camera Capacitor is much smaller than the PC so it makes sense the PC is fine and the camera is fucked
[4:47:50] HarryPatel: ya you never be turning them off, bro would leave a game on for 19 hours on discord
[4:47:52] RoninSisu: Im replacing mine and I have a Sony a7iii
[4:47:52] Rascal_PM: Do you have them plugged into the wall or a power strip with a fuse?
[4:47:56] vilosacrapter: ello m8s @BDG_Toa676 @BDG_parth28
[4:47:58] quaylewastaken: Your on the computers now. Tf you think running them hopes and dreams
[4:47:59] Athasin: @Lord_Legolas Yep and in less than 24 hours rules were changed
[4:47:59] shaymacp1945: run a dyno and check
[4:47:59] ooCORSAIRoo: power surge toasted the flux capacitor
[4:48:01] dianite_403: mine does it. surge portection board saves it but i find my PC reboots afterwards
[4:48:07] invalidskrrt: power surges happen when theres a surge in power
[4:48:07] irmatt2: camera has no protection for surge with dummy battery
[4:48:11] Enoobrac: you need to get a battery backup
[4:48:14] LJD420: have you checked to make sure its not a driver update ? @Deansocool
[4:48:15] DanLGG: so it could‚Äôve sent to much juice to the camera and that‚Äôs causing it to shut down now.
[4:48:17] bobbybeee: that sucks.. learn from mistakes tho.. new PC.. get cornwoods discount lol
[4:48:17] Enoobrac: I have it for my whole setup and it could run for a few hours
[4:48:24] Rascal_PM: You may just need a new powerstrip, those power surge protection strips do go bad
[4:48:27] RoninSisu: @irmatt2 ^^^^^^^^^
[4:48:33] conlethmcc30: if you have surge protector sockets you‚Äôll be fine
[4:48:35] xxlonegunmanxx: Send the Camera in for repairs, it will probably be around $100
[4:48:46] xxlonegunmanxx: depending on the issue
[4:48:56] SoulYou_: btw you mean a power surge or power outage? @Deansocool
[4:49:18] kb420ps: I use a line conditioner,  and plug my surge protectors in to that.
[4:49:18] shaymacp1945: maybe a lose cable or something
[4:49:25] Enoobrac: is audio desync from cam or is that just me?
[4:49:29] SuuWasTaken: dap problems and camera problems Sadge
[4:49:33] DanLGG: I have a surge protector that  over heated and an outlet melted. it never shut off I had to un plug it
[4:49:34] Rascal_PM: this may not help but have you done a factory reset to the camera?
[4:49:40] toddthestarfox: I thought it was after you move your set up
[4:49:40] Clodhoppr: have you turned your device off and on? peachEZ
[4:49:41] BDG_Toa676: deansoShake deansoShake deansoShake

[4:50:01] MoohamedAlii: make sure its on 1080p not 4k
[4:50:05] JazzPimp: is it getting hot?
[4:50:17] bobbybeee: maybe a change of pwoer strip too, to check
[4:50:18] toxicnoob91: Have u tried uninstalling camera and drivers and then changing the current slot and then reinstalling
[4:50:29] JazzPimp: it might have a dead capacitor
[4:50:34] irmatt2: @MoohamedAlii oh yeah, change the camera settings to 1080p
[4:50:38] toddthestarfox: how old is the power strip
[4:50:43] bobbybeee: maybe the cable is puffed
[4:50:44] dmurray01_: just turn camera off for 15 mins let it cool down
[4:50:47] hydalann: How many things do you have plugged into your PC? Maybe you are using too much power?
[4:50:55] ImEmanGaming: nah
[4:50:57] MuteDavinci: Free Tyrone

[4:51:10] ImEmanGaming: fuse probably fried
[4:51:10] Rascal_PM: thats the problem
[4:51:14] fatbuck: If the camera was not on but connected to power during the surge the internal cooling fan is fucked
[4:51:18] tacwombat: ouch
[4:51:18] Enoobrac: damn camera has ID-10-T error...
[4:51:19] f0rbin: how do you know there was a power surge?
[4:51:20] irmatt2: throw a small fan on to the camera, maybe it fixes all the issues
[4:51:23] Athasin: RIP
[4:51:24] BDG_parth28: Deffo fried
[4:51:28] invalidskrrt: take out the dummy battery and plug the camera right into the pc or wall for now
[4:51:33] dmurray01_: just turn it off for while till it cools
[4:51:41] kevin_2k0317: put ice on it
[4:51:42] MexiBrent: he has a fan coming today
[4:51:45] Streamlabs: Dont forget to Check out the Discord https://discord.gg/DtKKcK2

[4:51:54] fatbuck: ID-10-T is crazy
[4:51:56] Chipset3: thats what fucked it
[4:52:15] bobbybeee: better safe than sorry and all that

[4:55:21] ramsin50: that hasn't happened yet
[4:55:26] fkingjagaloon: that by meta but they talked about it in capt meeting
[4:55:37] fatbuck: According to Ruth its always Den's fault LOL

[4:56:22] Rascal_PM: that would be a W

[4:56:33] armedgolem01: should get a dap for that big ass head lol
[4:56:37] tr0kgaming: Just silly going down that road when you were trying to RP out the mechanics
[4:56:40] noon_106: theyd just bs and you wouldnt know
[4:56:42] Rascal_PM: They cant argue game mechanics and then not accept them at the same time, Ruth can argue it but the Judges cant
[4:56:49] ramsin50: but they can say read me the serial number on the flat bills
[4:56:53] fkingjagaloon: you already got dap for it though
[4:56:54] nathanarmstrong0: Or tell them to give it to the bank because they won't take it
[4:56:59] charybdes: Ruth is saying it and Cheever said she will be at the appeal this morning.

[5:01:07] Flueoffdoom: SEXODEAN
[5:01:27] kevin_2k0317: u got a dap for charging him possessions and once u get a guilty for that they have to remove the dap
[5:01:32] Athasin: Doesn't say IN possession
[5:01:37] chmbrs: it says possess tho
[5:02:01] ImEmanGaming: when is the trial
[5:02:07] fatbuck: but u cant prove that tho
[5:02:11] ImEmanGaming: yooo @Flueoffdoom
[5:02:17] bobbybeee: they played pass the parcel
[5:02:18] Flueoffdoom: @ImEmanGaming Yoo
[5:02:27] Rascal_PM: They technically admit to possession of the gun when they exchanged the money for the weapon
[5:02:34] chmbrs: im curious tho itll be ruled cause it feels like depending on what you say, it could go either way
[5:02:44] miguel_taffy123: he robbed without a mask, should be easy to prove he did possess it
[5:03:03] tr0kgaming: Tell them you already got DAP for this xD @Deansocool
[5:03:05] kevin_2k0317: yet u got dapped for it
[5:03:11] Rascal_PM: but he is admitting to it
[5:03:14] MisterParry: you should have Siobahn or some other real (Non-Ramee) lawyer argue your case
[5:03:18] Athasin: @chmbrs If I say it's illegal to eat and you ate breakfast, I arrest you and you say "Well I'm not currently eating" .... that's basically the issue at the moment
[5:03:21] ZirrTV: where did you get your standing desk from? @Deansocool
[5:03:33] ZirrTV: thanks big dog
[5:03:42] AlienatedFL: so the gun is sitting in the ocean right now lol
[5:03:43] scairyterry: @ZirrTV hey big guy
[5:03:46] ItsMagikzz: if dean wins this case can his DAPs be rescinded?
[5:03:50] AK_1G: Big d ?
[5:04:06] chmbrs: @Athasin yeah, itll be interesting to see how it gets ruled
[5:04:13] MexiBrent: yes because they saw you throw it
[5:04:36] wellie2404: and you got a fucking dap for that charge
[5:04:43] Athasin: LUL
[5:04:47] Jethrq: deansoP
[5:04:50] adrian_md46: yep LUL
[5:04:50] chmbrs: LUL
[5:04:58] HyperPerky: Sup @Deansocool and chat how is it going today deansoHeart2
[5:05:04] chmbrs: if you win that charge, that dap should be removed ASAP
[5:05:05] khlaah: Imagine, Snow gets guilty for that charge, and got dap'd anyway for that lol Still, the dap was warranted because the process was fucked up getting the two reports mixed up
[5:05:09] ImEmanGaming: deansoBozo
[5:05:12] ItsMagikzz: imo should lose the daps if you get the charge passed
[5:05:13] Athasin: @chmbrs I admit I'm conflicted, because I want Denzel to be vindicated, but I also want Ramee to make a ton of money from this case (which he will if he wins)
[5:05:14] bobbybeee: yeah make sure you reference what the charge says in mdt
[5:05:18] MonkeyFace101: is this trial happening today?
[5:05:23] ramsin50: but it's all about the double jeopardy

[5:07:14] AK_1G: bad example LUL
[5:07:15] MexiBrent: the problem is that it was on the wrong report right? Because the reference section doesn't matter for some reason
[5:07:17] ScreenFresh: its a posession charge
[5:07:23] Athasin: That would be he said she said though right?
[5:07:26] chmbrs: i see what he means but its so different lol
[5:07:36] Athasin: She says he robbed her, he said he didn't
[5:07:40] jkb_xD: possess means to have. Not if you have ever had.
[5:07:42] ShyGuySG_: cant get charged for possesion if you dont have possesion of w.e it is
[5:07:42] Jethrq: NA Education on this one brotha icl this is stupid af deansoP
[5:07:45] MisterParry: speeding and possession are very different
[5:08:06] kennygo_: who just randomly carries a huge camera on them.. only cornwood
[5:08:15] wellie2404: you gotta charge all of them tho
[5:08:19] khlaah: Den does too
[5:08:21] chmbrs: every cop has the big camera lol
[5:08:23] Rascal_PM: They technically should, dont think about it being a gun, think of it being a stolen car or something else. It would still apply
[5:08:34] kennygo_: oh really lol
[5:08:52] avoidschickens: get bodycams, if officer has bodycam on, ur allowed to use VODS as evidence
[5:08:57] chmbrs: @Rascal_PM thats a good argument too
[5:08:59] fatbuck: This reminds me of NCOs picking apart an instruction to send someone up for NJP LOL
[5:09:01] Flueoffdoom: @avoidschickens yeah
[5:09:01] Rascal_PM: This is a W cop case review session
[5:09:06] DannyL3tscher: I think you should be able to, if people are sharing a gun could you not get all of em on it?
[5:09:13] manliketha1: retainers?

[5:09:16] HarryPatel: oop
[5:09:16] MDM4ever1986HD: @avoidschickens you can't use bodycams
[5:09:18] MisterParry: @Rascal_PM stolen cars are often GTA which does not require possession
[5:09:19] Athasin: @chmbrs The biggest issue with using the mean "possessed at one point" over "IN possesion" is that, you can give people items without their consent. So... you're guilty just because someone gave it to you and you touched it once?
[5:09:20] khlaah: I feel comfortable enough betting all in my points on Snow getting the possession charge
[5:09:21] chmbrs: corn KEKW

[5:11:22] ImEmanGaming: highschool chemistry class kinda vibe
[5:11:31] MisterParry: @Rascal_PM that would be GTA with people charged as accomplices. The only important aspect of GTA is "taking a vehicle without consent, with the intent to deprive the owner of it's use.". There are accomplices to theft, but possession is not required for GTA
[5:11:37] Athasin: @Deansocool Proving possession will be easier now

[6:14:29] interp_tv: why do cops not have a prosecuter?
[6:14:30] Freddiepines: PD should never argue cases, the whole situation is fucking cooked from the get-go

[6:14:32] harimightyking: gg
[6:14:33] Ten_Ju: Cops shouldn't lawyer in court, there should be a DA
[6:14:34] KuMi_NL: ask aziz to take a stand and ask him what he knows about the case and ask him to read the witness statementy
[6:14:35] kb420ps: I think it's time to consider other forms of occupation.  Sanitation,  Senior Buns,  or Group 6.  There's NO court or paperwork.  This police thing just isn't working out for you. All jokes aside.
[6:14:35] serioushustle: Does Den Zel even know he can get a lawyer lol?

[6:14:56] Jethrq: You don't need help bruh just do whatever its gonna be fine deansoP
[6:14:58] improvisablex: You can recall Snow since he testified
[6:15:00] Clodhoppr: you need a killer closing

[6:36:40] MDM4ever1986HD: had you been prepared, got a lawyer and got the evidence you could have won it?
[6:36:45] Athasin: @Athasin DAP#7 - Trying to have a bench trial for Snow AFTER processing him, when you're suppose to have an appeal trial AFTER processing someone, not a bench

[6:45:32] AbeFroman2: robbery fits
[6:45:34] Zunnun: deano7
[6:45:35] dosk2: @Athasin no it's appealing the verdict from a previous trial, not re-trying him
[6:45:36] Flueoffdoom: deano7
[6:45:39] Flueoffdoom: omE
[6:45:48] CTRSWebb: possession of stolen goods is all you can prove
[6:45:54] Athasin: @Athasin But if you're processed the bench trial doesn't happen but it's considered to have happened
[6:46:00] ramsin50: yeah robbery is the best imo
[6:46:01] ffriedegg: @dosk2 i think it'd have to be a mistrail before a decision comes back. if the judge rules not guilty they're out of luck for these crimes. he could recharge for another crime in the situation like possession of govt property or something not on the current list of charges
[6:46:01] dapyman: Robbery outside and the other on the premises
[6:46:03] dosk2: @Athasin im new to how no pixel court works so idk if they have appeals but that's how it works irl
[6:46:05] Ficktions: You could ask them about the verbiage of the possession of gov't firearm too
[6:46:08] Athasin: @Athasin No there was no previous trial
[6:46:09] CrustyWill: deansoSmoke
[6:46:13] m4l1kkk: One day Den will shine in the courtroom üíî today is not that day
[6:46:16] detoksi: robbery doesnt fit because its not in the care of the bank anymore because its now in the care of the grouppe 6
[6:46:21] ffriedegg: im also not a lawyer so fuck i know.
[6:46:24] officialChicoB: Thanks, Chat, I will apply today. I pray I don't meet Officer Shiesty in the City
[6:46:27] beansontoast18: @m4l1kkk one day
[6:46:29] Zunnun: I am thinking this atm for deano WHOLETHIMCOOK
[6:46:34] Zunnun: SAJ
[6:46:35] AbeFroman2: its not the g6 members money its the companies right
[6:46:49] MDM4ever1986HD: @AbeFroman2 it's the banks
[6:46:57] detoksi: g6 is responsible for the security so its not on the bank
[6:46:58] AbeFroman2: yeah the bank
[6:47:01] wellie2404: but then that‚Äôs stacking no
[6:47:04] dapyman: G6 is a state employee
[6:47:06] rnAlsation: This judge has it twisted.
[6:47:09] julieannxox: @xypher85 HAHHAHAHHAHHA
[6:47:11] Athasin: @Athasin @dosk2 Yeah IRL you have a trial and appeal of the verdict
[6:47:16] xypher85: @julieannxox 4-2
[6:47:23] dosk2: @Athasin i was asking if he could appeal the verdict from this trial after the fact. like irl you can appeal the verdict of a trial if there's new evidence that is deemed credible.
[6:47:39] joster124: Why if he doesn't use force
[6:47:44] ramsin50: what if they just sneakily stole it
[6:47:45] chapoop_: thats if they used force what if they just stole it
[6:47:49] joster124: What *
[6:47:49] AlienatedFL: absolutely crazy that there is no state prosecutor
[6:47:55] AlienatedFL: i'd apply to do taht
[6:47:56] Athasin: @dosk2 Unfortunately in NoPixel, for RP reasons, no
[6:47:58] MexiBrent: is it their property though? or are they just transporting it
[6:48:02] Fluxsworn: Didn't you say that they just had the bags on them
[6:48:06] AbeFroman2: can you steal a g6 employee without force? lol
[6:48:10] Athasin: @dosk2 But in NoPixel, because of how much work it takes to get streamers and people together, no
[6:48:11] MDM4ever1986HD: @MexiBrent transporting it
[6:48:13] dosk2: @Athasin gotcha, thanks for explaining.
[6:48:18] ffriedegg: @dosk2 are you thinking about from prosecution side or from defendant side? prosecution has much more stringent rules on appealing a not guilty.
[6:48:19] DjSprayK: lets get this W
[6:48:41] crazyfr0gtv: rameeLaugh
[6:48:55] Fluxsworn: You cant prove shit other than it being in my possession and "I was going to drop it off personally to group6"

[9:10:58] Rascal_PM: Bro has 7 DAPs and says, can we lie?
[9:11:00] interp_tv: if its not in writing..
[9:11:18] MisterParry: IRL cops can lie 100%

[9:11:54] Phindrius: Would it not be classified as entrapment, at least IRL?
[9:11:59] Exotic_Rooster: i think if you use vague statements itll be better, like he asks for misdemeanor and you respond with we can work with you
[9:12:09] EGGZOLENTZ: If crims can do it, i dont see why cops cant
[9:12:19] MisterParry: you can lie, but you can't coerce
[9:12:23] Rascal_PM: Honestly, you should let another officer ask, youre under the microscope for those convos
[9:12:27] progressislife: relook at the recording cause he slipped up
[9:12:40] steven_even853: you should press him, because he has no lawyer. Just don't break pormises
[9:12:41] AbeFroman2: just dont promise anything

[9:13:27] Athasin: @Gaulty33 3 which he already got
[9:13:28] AbeFroman2: thats why police will say to 1 suspect split from another saying "your friend gave you up" when they never did
[9:13:37] Cosm1cChaos1: safer to not icl
[9:13:38] MakiWind: bad cop good cop
[9:13:40] hexxtokez420: @marneraiders exactly

[9:13:47] Gaulty33: @Athasin oh so its highcommand next?
[9:13:56] Rascal_PM: Judge denies the raid lol
[9:14:08] Exotic_Rooster: you just have to be vague enough for the guy to beieve you
[9:14:24] AbeFroman2: cops will tell interogtation suspects their friend spilled all the beans, just to get confessions = lieing
[9:14:24] marneraiders: There might be a possibility for a deal (don‚Äôt mention the contents of it)
[9:14:34] BDG_Toa676: Gn Dean n chat take care deansoHeart2 deansoHeart2 deansoBDG deansoBDG deansoBDG2 deansoBDG2

[9:14:50] Phindrius: JK KEKW
[9:15:10] Athasin: @Gaulty33 No he still has 7, DAPs 5, 6, and 7 were because of the Snow Grey situation
[9:15:28] Vince_dev_: I cant you make any promises he said Kappa
[9:15:39] Athasin: @Athasin And the court case was the Snow Grey case.

[9:16:53] Athasin: @Gaulty33 No. He got DAPs 5, 6, and 7 because of how poorly he handled the Snow Grey case and he LOST the Snow Grey case because of how poorly he handled the Snow Grey case
[9:16:57] AbeFroman2: if someone dont get pinned for 100 bags of weed KEKW
[9:17:26] Phindrius: Snitches get stitches Smadge
[9:17:27] Gaulty33: @Athasin got you, thanks for explaining, i thought they might stack on it.
[9:17:33] Athasin: @Athasin It's like if you get grounded because you... put vegetable oil in your dad's car and 3 days later his car broke down
[9:17:56] Clodhoppr: you need the how
[9:18:14] Athasin: @Athasin If your dad is fair you don't get grounded again for something you already was punished for.
[9:18:25] chelseafc_93: He's really thinking about this

[9:19:34] Phindrius: @AbeFroman2 Knowing and having evidence are two different things
[9:19:34] Evezh_: Tell him if the info checks out it will do him very well in the future with the pd
[9:19:41] EGGZOLENTZ: @abefroman2 ywah but they need more cases on it

[9:29:28] JordanJosphPurchall: hi
[9:29:32] Athasin: @EGGZOLENTZ I meant "investigative raid" aren't warrants meant to find something specific
[9:29:51] spritzgeschoss69: @Deansocool what with the people he lifes with if any`?
[9:30:04] combattingjosh: @Osama_binncappin yup, why it's a W KEKW. Imagine being in debt to Ramee
[9:30:11] EGGZOLENTZ: @athasin they are trying to get him to volunteer his house honestly
[9:30:20] Gachiguru: ALWAYS get the captain involved
[9:30:20] toothpickmusic: get him to sing and drop the raid.
[9:30:48] SuuWasTaken: a DT talking without lawyer? omE2

[9:31:23] Gachiguru: wait a minute you let the other guy go and you are trying to raid the apartment what if the other guy moves everything
[9:31:33] EGGZOLENTZ: If this were me, id walk in the room with him, make a sound and walk back out LUL Kappa
[9:31:52] KrazyAlpha_: is this the most fucked someone has been in 4.0?
[9:31:52] Thraxton1: dont make it complicated, just leaves more ins for him to get you in court
[9:31:56] wiglaf__: him saying ''customer'' proves he sells so you dont need to prove a pattern no?
[9:31:57] MisterParry: The cops are trying to do him dirty
[9:31:58] EGGZOLENTZ: @athasin they are wylin right now
[9:32:02] Athasin: @Gachiguru Depends on who actually have stuff in their apartment.
[9:32:31] Gachiguru: @Athasin probably should have raided both of them
[9:32:50] EGGZOLENTZ: @wiglaf__ customer can mean anything he just wants a smaller charge and hes gonna sing like a bird
[9:32:58] SuuWasTaken: i dont see why they would raid this time so you dont scare him off
[9:33:04] SuuWasTaken: why not raid him when next time he gets caught
[9:33:16] Gachiguru: @SuuWasTaken you have to with the amount they found
[9:33:23] Athasin: @Gachiguru Yeah most likely
[9:33:37] Thraxton1: you can wait 30 days to charge so you can see what he has in the property and then if that's not enough you can wait to get more before pushing
[9:33:42] mizzikk2401: will be in hold until the SW is done?
[9:33:43] AbeFroman2: they found over 57+ bags of weed
[9:33:47] SuuWasTaken: @Gachiguru did he have it on him? how much baggies did he have
[9:33:48] EGGZOLENTZ: I mean i get that but hes not consenting
[9:33:53] atdiamonds: he‚Äôs going to say no
[9:34:02] SuuWasTaken: Are they taking into consideration that the scale of the baggies is broken
[9:34:07] EGGZOLENTZ: @abefroman2 someone had 92+ and nothing
[9:34:09] Gachiguru: @SuuWasTaken its in the vehicle both of them are tied to this
[9:34:23] EGGZOLENTZ: @suuwastaken yeah its the bag amount
[9:34:23] TheIrishVikingX: what‚Äôs going on here?
[9:34:25] SuuWasTaken: did he have it in the vehicle and on him?
