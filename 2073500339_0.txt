[2:59:33] DezalbM: pure disrespect no matter what
[2:59:36] kronzillla: youve changed 4head
[3:02:19] onix146: Shruge its like that every restart with it
[3:02:25] mrmangasm: things just changed
[3:02:30] 1evilshark: thing is, hood jesus got the job 2 times in 3 days, last night was scuff tho
[3:02:47] 1evilshark: in my eyes
[3:02:48] Celascion: he felt a little guilty not letting others have the chance, and it had scuffed out for him the last few nights
[3:02:53] Celascion: (imo)
[3:02:59] Suvaacc: its not conflict, it didnt wanna hog the jobs, cause he tried it like 4th night in row
[3:02:59] 1evilshark: mr no conflict
[3:03:14] DezalbM: dundee had this problem yesterday grinder gangs are starting to act up abd piss people off
[3:03:27] Suvaacc: he wants other get a chance to do it, but the irony is that the guys who got it, have done it most of the time
[3:04:06] Suvaacc: yeah thats what happened, the guys who got it dont give a fuck, cause they have gotten it most
[3:04:11] Onlykushhh: he wanted to got to sleep Kappa
[3:04:25] histreamur: He had it twice in a row, after tsunami and it scuffed both times so that might also just be it
[3:04:31] svan223: I mean what i said in 4head chat if they made the system like this they want conflict RP
[3:04:44] 1evilshark: nah he wanted to do it, but it was not worth the fights when he got the job already few times
[3:05:04] jantyy__: True
[3:05:04] svan223: so people gonna have to run in with guns to do jewlery
[3:05:09] frigginoasis: where you talking about sleep at trav
[3:05:16] svan223: ya
[3:05:20] Suvaacc: the system is shit only cause it scuffs and you get like 1 or 2 per tsunami max. If everyone could do it every night, there wouldnt even be lines
[3:05:31] svan223: I mean what i dont get is people that is doing the run now they didnt even have a gun
[3:05:35] svan223: you need to
[3:05:41] 1evilshark: big one is once per tsunami, middle one is once per night i think
[3:05:45] svan223: ya
[3:05:52] svan223: thats the shit part
[3:06:05] Grachmann: You know what else sucks?
[3:06:06] Grachmann: Herpes
[3:06:10] svan223: it would be better if it was random times
[3:06:15] bonedead: how long til people are writing their names on a wall
[3:06:20] svan223: the big run was random times
[3:06:45] 1evilshark: those runs are alot of different types of scuff
[3:06:45] Fishnet83: id be shocked if that isnt getting reworked somehow
[3:06:54] 1evilshark: random locals in cars start shooting at you
[3:06:55] svan223: I mean its also only once per tsunami if they didnt change it
[3:07:00] Suvaacc: they just need to fix the scuff and i think the problem fixes itself, if you could do it every night 1 time, people wouldnt even have enough jewelry to do it at some point
[3:07:41] Suvaacc: your house literally has like 100k of jewelry in it needed to run
[3:07:46] Suvaacc: everyone is cumstacking
[3:07:51] StrugaWearsJorts: they’re gonna have to add a new way to get rid of jewelry cause everyone is sitting on loads of it
[3:07:52] svan223: I mean shit is gonna be held down by gangs vagos should just tax everyone doing it

[3:11:27] 1evilshark: try spawn it via app next to houses parking spot
[3:11:36] scha_de: track it, close the app on the phone, open it again - there should be a "spawn" option
[3:11:40] NemisizZ: sunglasses prolly blocking it
[3:11:50] 1evilshark: dont be on top of houses parking spot
[3:11:53] Suvaacc: @1evilshark he is at the parking spot

[3:14:17] scha_de: ^
[3:14:35] Gladie209: Oh shit
[3:14:41] scha_de: you track it, click on the arrow top left to go back to vehicle overview, click the seminole again and there should be spawn option
[3:15:22] scha_de: okay nvm KEKW
[3:15:30] CensoredTH0ughTs: who's the song? i know a lot of the lyrics but can't place it.

[3:16:27] Grachmann: Dean? Susge
[3:16:27] 1evilshark: oh no its who i think it is
[3:16:27] Suvaacc: sometimes the car bugs fully, 4head has had this same thing many times, that his car disappears for whole tsunami, even if he goes to the spot it should be at
[3:16:35] wkeyonlybill: is that Dean LOL
[3:16:38] NemisizZ: dean?

[3:47:31] Grachmann: Slorebear as I like to say
[3:47:49] Grachmann: Cornwood is "Fired" just like twitch streamers get "Banned"
[3:47:55] slorebear: oh ok

[3:50:08] CensoredTH0ughTs: yeah i think they realized they had too many eyes on them Kappa
[3:50:09] Suvaacc: idk, deans viewership has been like 2-5k when he was on cop
[3:51:04] Grachmann: My viewership is 0 and I was never hired Susge
[3:51:09] 1evilshark: it was rare to get fired as a cop at 3.0 you had to do some major shit, how 3 ppl are fired in 2 months
[3:51:17] Suvaacc: if they would actually fire cornwood like dean and he can come back, then i would say they have changed their stance about being popular
[3:51:23] slorebear: when i go live theres always 4 bots they are my friends and only viewers

[3:53:32] Suvaacc: from the stance point of they fucking up i can understand the firing, but those 2 were one of the most active cops and PD is lacking numbers so hard atm, thats why i dont understand why grief yourself atm, get numbers up and then fire them

[3:55:10] ky05uk3: Esfand is such a cool dude in general
[3:55:46] Suvaacc: yeah, i just hope that people like esfand dont get discouraged from it so much that they wont even play anymore, cause that would be overall bigger loss i think

[3:57:31] Grachmann: Yup
[3:57:40] Suvaacc: yeah cause esfand was goofy cop in 3.0, but now he cant goof out so much
[3:57:41] thebradshaw6: they get disouraged..just dont show it
[3:58:26] scha_de: "Cornwood does it, so I can do it too"
[3:58:33] scha_de: and you end up with the 3.0 PD
[3:58:36] slorebear: you can only have 1 or 2 brick fingles if you have 15 good cops
[3:58:44] 1evilshark: food
[3:58:56] thebradshaw6: everyone has been discouraged at one point in time on NP
[3:59:05] Grachmann: Die right now because you meta'd Madge
[3:59:07] Fishnet83: you can't act on that or it's a -1 for you Madge
[3:59:37] Suvaacc: yeah, 3.0 had other officers who did the work, but now most of the old guard is gone. So esfand needs to start filling the more serious cop spot.
[3:59:57] slorebear: im telling koil you meta'd
[4:00:13] 1evilshark: but the old guards still plays on new cops, brock letty, new snow, andrews...

[4:00:35] ky05uk3: Jamgie
[4:01:02] frigginoasis: see what other think about it
[4:01:31] Suvaacc: the problem i think is that esfand is more like old sandy pd character, but atm PD wants more serious people.
[4:02:29] Dangerouscrave: why dont she just follow you
[4:03:03] onix146: waste of gas too
[4:03:38] DezalbM: perfect driveby car
[4:03:47] Dangerouscrave: the reason i ask is because of the locals towing there car
[4:03:57] Suvaacc: i'm a be honest i havent watched pd side in 4.0 almost at all. So i'm not exactly sure what is going on, but i dont really understand how its been 2 months and they still dont have numbers.
