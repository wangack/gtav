[0:33:03] NoahS116: I think pd or whoever placed them. you shouldn’t be able to break stills you didn’t place
[0:33:04] Lepaca: CG has been robbing everyone with a pulse for weeks, so the list of possible suspects is huge

[0:38:21] NoahS116: losing shit is fine if rp comes out of it, but all you can do is speculate now
[0:38:48] internalin: having no clues as to who did it is kinda dumb
