[3:50:20] iraffis: Wait tell Guns becomes easy cops are going to get shot
[3:50:45] spacebunz666: cops are gonna go crazy to catch cars
[3:50:46] ItsAHazardLife: That's the only downside to city council meetings. The vote on random stuff they want even if it's not good for the economy.
[3:50:48] KorbenDallas815: there MIGHT be changes to the rule of 6 after the qq'ing from yesterday, yay cops being mad about their own actions
[3:51:03] David_usgames: KEKW

[3:51:39] TekEvolution: So....bike plan for laundromat heist today?
[3:51:42] KorbenDallas815: btw, how many cop cars did you have after you when you got that felony?
[3:51:49] turntablist_mk2: hopefully photo evidence is required for the tampering
[3:51:50] David_usgames: KEKW
[3:52:03] chrispy03: Didn’t he say it had to be present at the crime so that means spots are going to be crazy
[3:52:13] meego0o: tbh, crimes get away 9 out of 10 times. u guys just overreacting
[3:52:15] SenorTaavi: And the normal strike system runs along with the new one?
[3:52:39] een1Z: Just wait till the pull the heli's out OOF
[3:52:40] xrpjesn: @meego0o u say that but now cops just gonna go harder if its a personal car :p

[3:55:10] xrpjesn: i also feel like letting your friend lock pick your car is meh
[3:55:14] Mills_RP: hola papi
[3:55:18] lucho724_: this is just gonna be bike swaps, impossible car swaps and shootouts to save cars

[3:56:00] BVNISH: they need the car w/o signs of tampering
[3:56:15] lucho724_: I believe if they can prove association it still counts
[3:56:17] whodonut5: @lucho724_ yeah but cops even now can shoot tires of bikes, so they will just do that
[3:56:36] lucho724_: every gang gonna need an auction guy now
[3:56:48] xdSilly: mhm

[3:59:44] itsbanana1107: it will be more ratty
[3:59:45] mfonsner1: maybe a way to "expunge" your car
[4:00:05] shadow091319: I get it but seems like people will get more ratty now with bikes and stuff
[4:00:07] Nemo7: Imagine if you could hack the system with butcoin and remove strikes sntGiggle

[4:00:25] turntablist_mk2: @Nemo7 5Head
[4:00:28] zaps6666: if they want less rats i think there could be better ways cus this will just turn into bike swaps every chase from banks again

[4:02:46] CoherentScreams: They are raising the "cost" of being a crim, to promote more civ options perhaps? 3.0 was just a super crim server, for the good and the bad of that, already gangs are trying to have "clean" people not just to own a house but for other things, it is making for some great RP, and great non crim RP. The slower burn is refreshing from the constant turf wars and insta shootouts of 3.0. That got old fast...
