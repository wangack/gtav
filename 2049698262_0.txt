[0:40:16] jh9844: I don‚Äôt think Emily knew he was leaving. She seemed legit sad.
[0:40:38] Damomentt: @R3Mix7 bro shave ur ass #manscaped sponsor when
[0:40:44] zenyatta: wakewiHmm
[0:40:53] Yoshi_DG: I have genius plan bro, drop an alt coin to pay for membership/invest and RUG PULL Huehue
[0:40:58] malakai00_: What ideas you got for the hallways other than kirby
[0:41:07] irongodLIVE: @R3Mix7 real
[0:41:09] voxlegis: there are a bunch of people who are amazing artists who WOULD do it for free/ shoutout socials tho, looking to hire someone seems like it would be a waste
[0:41:12] Catmistry: exemWave
[0:41:15] lifeinreverse1: S
[0:41:19] lifeinreverse1: Wow
[0:41:23] Jojo_XCIV: emiruSUBS

[0:41:24] JTrevvvv: emiruSUBS
[0:41:33] FezAudi: did u go to uccs? i got caught in a jstu video there too
[0:41:34] zxserty: its funny how fixated miz got on having that buff kirby
[0:41:35] R3Mix7: I guess we will never know
[0:41:37] GavinMazey: Just gotta get emily into situations you have to save her then EZ farm
[0:41:38] Cumaraderie: BUFFCOUSIN
[0:41:39] C_R_I_T_I_C_A_L: Yeah Knut bold spot is coming back to Norway..we need more daylight over here üòÇüòÇ
[0:41:39] zenyatta: @voxlegis thats fine until they start demanding artistic direction without paying for it
[0:41:47] ericparentart: @voxlegis delusional lmao
[0:41:49] classytaco_: classytaco_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months, currently on a 5 month streak! PogU trainer
[0:41:51] Soneto__: emiruSUBS
[0:41:52] MESSlII: i think buff kirby would be sick
[0:41:53] kuleana_o7: you'll do great training her
[0:41:55] smackkt: Paint a Rottweiler pulling a sled of weights
[0:41:58] zenyatta: Pay for peoples' labor please
[0:42:00] D__Clone: y'all will be repainting over that kirby so fast
[0:42:03] GoalHead: If you could give Emily a gyatt you'd be a hero
[0:42:03] sogrubegroj_: My cousin paid a muralist to paint his car repair shop near Little Havana, 70k... @wakewilder but it was HUGE and it was in installments
[0:42:06] AnAwakenedPanda: Emily is very results oriented so that's the biggest stick
[0:42:08] sigchld: Kyle really saved it for Knut but you don't need that help
[0:42:13] atomisoija: You could just project images on wall and paint the lines diy
[0:42:18] smudgeyk: doing it correctly IS the content mhm
[0:42:24] MegaManGreen: just do Knut accent when training
[0:42:25] kuleana_o7: its emily so u dont need to worry too much about the content side haha
[0:42:26] brittanywittany: Shes the content machine
[0:42:36] BART____BART: who is the striking/jitz girl with the tattoos - does she compete?
[0:42:37] weston_h14: hi
[0:42:38] malakai00_: Should be fine
[0:42:39] voxlegis: @voxlegis I mean, if someone wants pay, paying them is what you do, but there are plenty of artists who would be happy to just for a shout out, as a business, doesnt really make sense to not use them instead
[0:42:39] ericparentart: I hope the artists had a disclaimer that shit might get painted over lol
[0:42:40] jh9844: chat could help pay for the mural with a dono goal
[0:42:41] GrannBrigitte: well if you want to be a serious squidward about the training, that's a fine dynamic
[0:42:47] selou8: the gym content is so fucking good
[0:42:50] StreamElements: RESPONDED TO DAILY LIVE ON STREAM https://forms.gle/Fu9Yav7MLfik3msUA
[0:42:53] grazie____ragazzi: is it true most bodybuilders are weebs
[0:42:53] malakai00_: I'll be tuning in for your training stuff with her for sure
[0:42:57] Teleprompte: Yall gotta get some bags for the fighters/boxers
[0:42:57] behoymeth: twitch chat can backseat anything, even entrepreneurship
[0:43:01] Cumaraderie: @GrannBrigitte  spongerailed
[0:43:03] sigchld: It might be partly the language barrier but Knut's not great at instructing
[0:43:07] jh9844: Or just by spreading their cash app
[0:43:11] BART____BART: who is the striking/jitz girl with the tattoos - does she compete? Û†ÄÄ
[0:43:23] GoalHead: It would be insane if they pay over 10k for a mural
[0:43:35] LucidFire: don't you think the artist today was pretty good? some people were saying he wasn't, but i think he did a good enough job
[0:43:36] hazzrig44: sam sulek is a weeb aswell
[0:43:39] D__Clone: dragonball baki and naruto are massive in the gym sphere
[0:43:49] zenyatta: @voxlegis you dont understand my point....doing work for exposure often ends up with the artist doing more than they should, even for exposure. if someone wants to give art direction they should commission it with actual money
[0:43:52] limegrove: ive been a painter for 28 years and honestly murals can be extremely expensive. its a LOT of time, a lot of skill required.
[0:43:53] Cumaraderie: @BART____BART Juilia, 2-0 vs Miz
[0:44:11] Love_ski: @Wakewilder with those ideas that Miz was throwing at the artist , this hallway gonna look like kids arcade hallway..
[0:44:19] jh9844: you could help someone who does live art launch their twitch career
[0:44:27] Teleprompte: tbh, the armadillo was a bit confusing at first, but if you look at it a while you can see the armadillo
[0:44:36] malakai00_: Yeah the inside should be crazy good
[0:44:41] D__Clone: YEP
[0:44:42] sogrubegroj_: Also the gym cannot be used for at least 5 days because of the chemicals as far as i understand if inside painting is done
[0:44:45] nft_scam: mhm
[0:44:45] malakai00_: YEP
[0:44:50] JTrevvvv: Rime
[0:44:50] malakai00_: True
[0:44:50] Furibundo: mhm
[0:44:50] Deity_of_Blades: did i miss the magnet part?
[0:44:51] Cumaraderie: KEKW
[0:44:52] MESSlII: tbf there were supposed to be multiple artists today
[0:44:52] LeckiSJL: Rime
[0:44:53] jaypoee: true
[0:44:54] Lunchbreakk: Rime *exists*
[0:44:55] malakai00_: Rime
[0:44:55] hrafnagut: @limegrove yeah it feels like miz and knut cannot wrap their heads around that
[0:44:56] Imprisoned_Fetus: Pog lucky bastard
[0:44:57] Yoshi_DG: Or fucking Esfand true
[0:44:57] Cumaraderie: Wime
[0:45:00] Zrayy: true and noted
[0:45:00] Dodgeless: Let them go wild, can always paint over it in 10 minutes If it sucks~
[0:45:00] Yoshi_DG: (kidding)
[0:45:01] limegrove: painting a mural is different from doing paper or canvas art too, its a different skill. you cant just ask anyone.
[0:45:01] voxlegis: @voxlegis I do understand, but as a business, if someone wants to do it for "free" it would literally be a bad business decision to not do that
[0:45:02] Cumaraderie: YOURMOM
[0:45:03] cloudykiz: youtube is much better
[0:45:05] GavinMazey: Rime me?
[0:45:08] rusty_rooster: julie should start streaming
[0:45:10] MeowgicTheCathering: my moms grip has nothing on my own SALAMI
[0:45:13] malakai00_: Need a what a fox mural mhm
[0:45:13] jh9844: A muralist would be there for a while, interacting with you guys and being on stream
[0:45:14] Hollabackyoungnn: wait was that a joke?
[0:45:14] C_R_I_T_I_C_A_L: Being streamer on twitch is so hard.. trust me.. üòÇ
[0:45:28] limegrove: @hrafnagut its such hard work. a skill i dont have at all but i know tons of muralists. i admire that work a lot.
[0:45:33] dr_pushups: did the armadillo turn out ?
[0:45:35] finneysmith10: i wouldve put mma/bodybuilding motivation stuff in the tunnel
[0:45:38] bigmanskraa: Is it better to get 1 hour of sleep or none?
[0:45:39] kuleana_o7: its safer to simply pay someone for their art rather than 'exposure' too
[0:45:41] sigchld: They need you at the gym during those earlier hours to help with decisions like picking the muralists. Rob was asking for input but no one provided any.
[0:45:41] Teleprompte: Gotta find an artist with good Vision
[0:45:48] R3Mix7: nobody ever wants to talk about the butthole yet 50% males 35 y.o and older suffer from hemroids
[0:45:48] HipsterSal: I could easily be a 1k andy if I wanted to but then I would be stealing viewers from wake so I dont
[0:45:55] malakai00_: What ideas you got for the inside then?  Or is that left to the artist
[0:45:57] jjshiffy: @bigmanskraa 1
[0:46:08] zenyatta: @hrafnagut from what i heard about how the first artist was treated i dont think they underastand or care about the concept of theft of services
[0:46:15] hrafnagut: @limegrove yeah i did a short documentary in college on a local muralist, it was fascinating to learn more about that world
[0:46:17] Yoshi_DG: we need unbelievably big bazongas on every single wall HahaSweat HandsUp
[0:46:20] MegaManGreen: a lot of streamers have degrees
[0:46:21] jh9844: The guy from KILL TONY is who I had in mind he could for sure do live art on stream
[0:46:31] bigmanskraa: @jjshiffy really? But how would I get up from bed with 1 hour of sleep. I don't have the dicipline for that
[0:46:36] malakai00_: mhm
[0:46:43] ale234: thoughts on miz  taking multiple consumable products without paying doesn‚Äôt it need to be inventoried? I know owner but ya need a system or is it fine? kat lady seems annoyed

[0:47:16] Yoshi_DG: the art can wait
[0:47:16] bigmanskraa: @jjshiffy no
[0:47:17] kerplunk890: do u have ownership of the gym to
[0:47:23] kyoshi_ne: robot artists with gpt and dall-e coming soon
[0:47:23] sogrubegroj_: Now that you had this "experience" of how much people are drawn to events like opening a gym, in the future would you change the way that other streamers meetups are handled? @wakewilder like the wild west thing, or OTK playing sports etc?
[0:47:27] kcyea: @ale234 he literally payed for it on stream
[0:47:31] Turgon478: give dennis 200 for no couches
[0:47:40] 6ckines: I think people when they heard Graffiti art/ Murals it was stuff like this https://e1.pxfuel.com/desktop-wallpaper/884/808/desktop-wallpaper-shipping-creative-gym-custom-3d-bodybuilding-cartoon-beasts-wood-gym-wall-cheap-gym-mural.jpg
[0:47:42] Dodgeless: sniper might show up one night and paint dicks on the wall at anytime, pay for the inside not the outside
[0:47:48] renzsee: @ale234 he paid for it
[0:47:50] toohot2handle00: When do we get a late night stream at the gym?
[0:48:01] malakai00_: How long until 24/7? @wakewilder
[0:48:01] sogrubegroj_: yeah novelty
[0:48:08] darthnael: YEP that's my interest
[0:48:15] Turgon478: the wild west business Kappa
[0:48:17] uliloves: we need a gym stream with lacari
[0:48:17] furiouttug: classic
[0:48:22] 6ckines: 24/7 2025 cONFIRMED
[0:48:22] renzsee: classic
[0:48:22] sogrubegroj_: Maybe you do, kinda, seeing streamers fail on the business side LIVE is a new scope of content√ß
[0:48:25] darthnael: classic
[0:48:31] D__Clone: people just like people hanging out too, streaming is always better together
[0:48:36] irishmun42o: chat if i work for an army research lab does that make me a boot licker
[0:48:40] toohot2handle00: idle money is a wild concept
[0:48:41] malakai00_: Yeah i heard it got delayed, just was wondering by how much
[0:48:42] Curtisbeef: 1.50 hotdog at the gym? Kappa
[0:48:45] nft_scam: emily 24/7 stream at gym inc
[0:48:47] Yoshi_DG: we just gooning fr\
[0:48:52] Fhrostitute: same with ludwig
[0:48:53] Fhrostitute: events
[0:48:56] Turgon478: gives him something to do
[0:48:56] doogar: i started watching mizkif/emily because its such a unique thing watching a business rise/startup
[0:48:56] ponponm: who owns the majority stake in the gym and what happens in case of a conflict?
[0:48:58] jared_____________: yeah, that "doll house" stream was incredibly expensive
[0:48:58] SilverHornet13: loss leader, like Costco's hotdog combo price
[0:49:00] doogar: its been great
[0:49:05] kuleana_o7: big streamer events seem to rarely ever make money. at most you hear they simply break even
[0:49:14] jh9844: Gym-a-thon
[0:49:15] sqwanzo: wild west spread the wealth around
[0:49:19] Turgon478: stream once every 2 months
[0:49:22] 13monad3: the streamer awards cost 800k or something
[0:49:22] mozsers: clint stevens no stream for a month type afk money EZ
[0:49:22] Chi_Thuggery: most large entertainment events are losses for companies etc
[0:49:27] QUICKSILV3R: shots fired at Qt
[0:49:28] toohot2handle00: its the QT model of streaming
[0:49:28] supercoolguy68: i think jerma works with offbrand so they probably help him with costs
[0:49:34] KraklinTV: streamers owning an esports team is probably an example of a loss but a passion to help the industry
[0:49:35] itsdomtv: what happened to the cum wall Madge
[0:49:38] Turgon478: how many subs does clint still have
[0:49:40] jh9844: Austin Show

[0:49:40] malakai00_: The strongman thing rob for going on seems like it's gonna be cool
[0:49:42] Chi_Thuggery: the point is to draw in an audience etc
[0:49:45] Teleprompte: GamesDoneQuick?
[0:49:56] skw813: Art is a trade just like everything else. You get what you pay for. Wouldn't expect a plumber to fix your plumbing for free. Not well anyways.
[0:49:58] ArCiele: @malakai00_ is it this Friday?
[0:50:09] sogrubegroj_: but maybe is a new meta, just streamers doing like social attempts of making money like investing in a drink and launching it live etc
[0:50:12] irishmun42o: subnautica tn?
[0:50:12] Crikeste: He's a great streamer
[0:50:14] darthnael: he streams on a side channel KEKW
[0:50:14] daddysworkin: How do you factor in your work hours with your physical goals, knowing how important sleep is to the equation ?
[0:50:16] D__Clone: austin does stream on his alt pretty often
[0:50:19] emptyy_head: he streams as a 737 pilot sometimes
[0:50:26] zenyatta: wakewiHmm
[0:50:30] Elysianlight: @sogrubegroj_ I dont think launching random businesses is a meta
[0:50:35] lightninggmcqueenn: what is your liability as an owner of the gym
[0:50:35] Turgon478: clint has 4 hours this month and 650 subs
[0:50:41] AnAwakenedPanda: I love how everyone bounces off each other at the gym
[0:50:41] Jax_Kangaroo: whaddup wake
[0:50:49] JambalaYASSSS: are there security cameras in the tunnel hallway? given how much exposure the gym is getting with all the murals, I hope there‚Äôs concerns about them being defaced by potential saboteurs
[0:50:49] daddysworkin: nice =)
[0:50:52] ericparentart: I just think doing nothing would be better than not paying for some half assed dog shit lmao
[0:50:53] malakai00_: @arciele i don't know actually, I'm talking about the event miz was talking about sponsoring
[0:50:54] Teleprompte: Have you done any MMA sessions yet Wake?
[0:50:57] sogrubegroj_: @Elysianlight i think it could be, not exactly that, but it seems like a good idea "corporate attempts live" is quite fun
[0:51:00] bigmanskraa: Jacked
[0:51:00] renzsee: its so much fun
[0:51:04] irishmun42o: streamers = free labor pog
[0:51:05] ericparentart: than paying for***
[0:51:05] kerplunk890: did you expect the gym to do so well in such a fast time
[0:51:05] TimmyVaII: wait so the artists are being paid ? some people said they weren't
[0:51:07] darthnael: the gym has actually got me excited to do better with my own health
[0:51:11] Zrayy: dang it
[0:51:11] doogar: im loving the new faces poppin in like the strong man lacari viewer and jules
[0:51:14] memmmmmly: @JambalaYASSSS Susge

[0:51:29] Yaystuffy: Austin streamed 5 times on his alt last year OMEGADANCE
[0:51:30] zenyatta: @TimmyVaII it's a little unclear
[0:51:39] dylandistance: the gym looks sick! been watching the gym streams since last week!
[0:51:40] malakai00_: I think you'll have 500 within 30 days @wakewilder
[0:51:41] tpower118: rob is such a good asset
[0:51:44] JambalaYASSSS: @memmmmmly I‚Äôm in Los Angeles LUL
[0:51:46] sogrubegroj_: That gym actual opening is in March for they tell us, this is just like the guerilla stage done by streamers, which is also good
[0:51:57] darthnael: Rob is a BEAST
[0:52:00] memmmmmly: @JambalaYASSSS Sure
[0:52:04] ArCiele: unfortunate that golds gym is next door
[0:52:06] toohot2handle00: the location is still sus, the backbone is MMA without its toast
[0:52:06] limegrove: @zenyatta the first artist was paid when rob fired him and the 2nd guy will get paid.
[0:52:08] Aezroe: Rob carry
[0:52:09] bigmanskraa: You lowkey look like that Sean o'pry guy
[0:52:14] kuleana_o7: chatters underestimate you guys too much

[0:52:23] DartTheBarefootDodo: Hello

[0:52:29] BIakeAustin: what is different about a bodybuilding gym
[0:52:30] zenyatta: @zenyatta in money, not exposure?
[0:52:32] ArCiele: are you guys going for hardcore?
[0:52:34] rusty_rooster: gold there could be a blessing...brings ppl that want gym life near your gym
[0:52:40] break_the_bone: The management of every Gold's Gym in my area is a fucking nightmare
[0:52:43] aKa_Rush_x: Was the MMA planned that early or was that a lucky coincidence?

[0:52:58] iEos: wake enjoyers GIGACHAD
[0:53:02] D__Clone: nevermind I'm a liar austin streamed 4 times last year on his alt om
[0:53:03] malakai00_: There still a lot of locals that aren't even aware of ironforge as well. Can't imagine the spike after a local push
[0:53:05] sogrubegroj_: Apparently it sucks being a GYM manager, there is no actual day of rest  i noticed that, Rob is such a beast
[0:53:06] finneysmith10: those big corpa gyms probably have a lot more inactive members too
[0:53:11] mc_leafy: My issue with where I live is that the only 24 hr. gym is actually terrible and way over priced for basically the same equipment i have at home
[0:53:14] Ithiras: Why don't you have a pre workout just basead WAKE.

[0:54:19] darthnael: that's great value
[0:54:27] bigmanskraa: I pay about 30 a month for my gym
[0:54:27] furiouttug: its tiring but probably fulfilling for rob
[0:54:28] sogrubegroj_: thats how im still paying for Anytime fitness and im not even in the US anymore...
[0:54:32] mc_leafy: Thats literally any business when you first start it if you want to be successful

[1:04:18] irishmun42o: he wasnt promised payment but rob paid him 100 bucks for his time
[1:04:19] voxlegis: @bigmanskraa sounds like some fake sup pills lol
[1:04:31] johnnyi215: https://slokeone.com/  this is his website
[1:04:36] eddimmu: MIZ stream title was DRAMA at the gym,

[1:04:49] jh9844: his portfolio is actually impressive I‚Äôve seen his work around Austin
[1:05:06] TimmyVaII: rob said he did the name " because of the payment" idk what that means
[1:05:06] banReddit: maybe he was dedicated to the bit
[1:05:07] DiB760: His IG is just his name on walls
[1:05:07] bryanmwah: look like an edgy dude
[1:05:08] zenyatta: mmm hmm
[1:05:09] johnnysaurusx: Who hired him OMEGADANCE
[1:05:10] irishmun42o: he left before u got there
[1:05:11] dettadetta__: whenever i work out, my muscles get sore. this feels unhealthy to me, as from my understanding the soreness is due to damage, and induces repair. isnt this just creating more problems for my body, and making it expend more energy in repairing the self imposed damage? it seems like self harm
[1:05:18] sturdytofu: is he the guy that came into do an AR mural pitch?
[1:05:21] Taargus_435: I think Julia had a good point about not having armadillo guy do the entire wall
[1:05:30] hrafnagut: it seems to me like he probably sent rob samples of his work that might‚Äôve been curated to streamers tastes, and they assumed that was what he was gonna do there
[1:05:32] solarrakk: his cousin filled in for him
[1:05:40] davidsalsa_: helloge @wakewilder hope youre having a good day. what did you eat today. have a good stream sanchHeart

[1:05:55] MESSlII: his insta is all his name
[1:05:59] maiouxmaioux: what's the controversy? did he write "iran farge?"
[1:06:07] DiB760: His IG is just his name
[1:06:12] Jax_Kangaroo: im confused what did he do?
[1:06:15] jh9844: ppl say the name was just a base or something
[1:06:15] Dick_Piston: shame there was issues there, dude does great work
[1:06:17] Raheat_: he wanted to start with his name I guess? not sure why he wouldn't say that in negotiations
[1:06:17] shadeleamun: maybe hes just a crazy dude?
[1:06:21] irishmun42o: only time to this day i threw up from exhaustion was during a wrestling match
[1:06:24] bryanmwah: i dont like it
[1:06:24] renzsee: he's good
[1:06:28] Dodgeless: It was a catfish kekw
[1:06:30] johnnyi215: there had to be some form of miscommunication
[1:06:34] renzsee: it happened on knuts stream
[1:06:36] bryanmwah: to abstract
[1:06:39] banReddit: ego andy LUL
[1:06:40] hrafnagut: literally every graffiti artist ever, when they see that wall and hear that they can paint there, will paint their name as large as possible
[1:06:41] spaceyjeromee: a lot of graffiti artists just tag their name. missed out on a good artist
[1:06:43] eddimmu: its very difficult to deal with artists,
[1:06:43] JTrevvvv: So was the wall going to look like one of these? It didn't seem like it was about to look like that lol
[1:06:44] solarrakk: it looked like he was sketching out and someone wrote over his stuff
[1:06:44] tatersalad: did I miss the magnet talk?
[1:06:46] gong_jeon: i like abstract stuff
[1:06:47] SeminoleGamer: So what work did he do?
[1:06:50] irishmun42o: maybe check knuts vod
[1:07:00] TimmyVaII: maybe they were going to under pay him and make up for it with exposure idk
[1:07:03] banReddit: wonder what life was like before graffiti art. Were walls just empty
[1:07:03] Yaystuffy: The Boondocks mural was sick
[1:07:06] renzsee: i think him and rob had a lot of miscommunication i dunno
[1:07:06] hrafnagut: yes
[1:07:10] hrafnagut: work he gets paid for
[1:07:21] ericparentart: how much was he offered
[1:07:23] dettadetta__: @TheVulpecula i just feel like my body has enough on its plate, our brains burn alot of calories and the immune system is constantly fighting away bad agents. working out to point of exertion feels like burdening my body and really unnecessary for a healthy life
[1:07:24] Raheat_: yeah idk why he just started with his name
[1:07:27] irishmun42o: it was mural size just only his name
[1:07:28] Wolfstar_Builds: @hrafnagut he did get paid
[1:07:31] Raheat_: and he wasn't up front about it
[1:07:36] radon_219: is there a picture?
[1:07:38] Bulabomb: didn't you say the hallway artists weren't being paid
[1:07:39] johnnyi215: he gave him $100 apparently
[1:07:41] The_lone_Ragnar: he just said that because you're not gonna pay me he was just gonna do his name or something like that
[1:07:42] malakai00_: Rob paid him to leave lol
[1:07:44] fluffytummmy: if i remember it was 600$
[1:07:50] StreamElements: TRUTH OR DAB THIS THURSDAY -- ASK AWAY https://forms.gle/chyYmFxVEASiFVjn9
[1:07:52] jh9844: $100 was to leave
[1:07:52] ericparentart: @Wolfstar_Builds $100 is nothing lmao
[1:07:53] Dodgeless: He proudly thought he was gonna milk the millionaires and it did t happen
[1:07:53] Uther_The_Lightbringer: just paint anime chars doing bench press or dead lift
[1:08:01] irishmun42o: @dettadetta__ true, my health teacher in highschool had a really bad relationship with fitness for that reason
[1:08:05] Acco10x: Wake what do you think of this print? https://www.officebarn.biz/shop/new-office-furniture/office-decor-new/framed-rustic-cow-print-2/
[1:08:06] Raheat_: yeah rob paid him for his time and to make him leave
[1:08:07] BIakeAustin: he was a psyop from golds gym
[1:08:08] darkrust09: hey wake how is your night
[1:08:09] irishmun42o: sorry chat im in reply guy mode
[1:08:13] chefdardini: Hopefully this doesn't sway other artists from working with you guys
[1:08:14] zenyatta: @Dodgeless that is a crazy accusation ngl
[1:08:15] voxlegis: @ericparentart the 100 dollars was so that he would leave after doing not what they diusscussed
[1:08:15] Chuncinator: the payment was just rob in good faith for his time
[1:08:16] wafflecone369: late but stoned so:  to him he did $x amount of art.
[1:08:17] MESSlII: you guys need a wall for signatures like big tex has
[1:08:18] johnnyi215: I'm pretty sure he was under the impression it was a community mural even he could put his name and the rob got mad he was putting his name
[1:08:20] Dr_BobKelso: Miz said he will pay the guy whe did the armadillo
[1:08:25] Raheat_: because we were all like "yo what is he making KEKW "
[1:08:26] Wolfstar_Builds: @ericparentart for writing his name on 3 entire segments of wall? he should be paying them 100 dollars cleaning charges lmfao
[1:08:30] heavenlycreatures_: pay them in 10min morgpie discord vc
[1:08:32] ericparentart: lots streamers seem out of touch about how much time is worth lmao
[1:08:33] KEKEmonster: @dettadetta__ your cells are constantly dying and reproducing, you will be fine
[1:08:38] wafflecone369: $100
[1:08:48] jh9844: he could‚Äôve milked Miz a few years ago easily LUL
[1:08:49] Raheat_: yeah communication gap I guess
[1:08:51] FangCrit: Who was the Artist that got upset?
[1:08:56] kerplunk890: whos idea was it to open a gym
[1:08:57] fluffytummmy: @heavenlycreatures_ I'll take it
[1:09:00] renzsee: im willing to bet it is a communication issue
[1:09:01] uliloves: must've been the criticism
[1:09:03] wafflecone369: best way to put it Wake.
[1:09:04] johnnyi215: Maybe he heard Asmon's take on AI Art OMEGALUL
[1:09:07] FrostyTide13: @johnnyi215 rob and them said it was fine for him to do name, but they thought he was going to do other stuff, but that wasn‚Äôt the case
[1:09:07] TheVulpecula: @TheVulpecula whatever u want brotha
[1:09:07] SilverHornet13: miz as only paying people in Burger King Combos
[1:09:08] malakai00_: Probably
[1:09:10] chompin_cheddar: nice beard
[1:09:10] Turgon478: gaslighting narcissist 100%
[1:09:11] Raheat_: and when rob was like "what's going on" the artist started getting riled up
[1:09:15] ericparentart: he probably thought they were paying him to tag shit
[1:09:15] ayenawfr: for reference murals on a wall of a building in my small small town cost $20k+
[1:09:17] bryanmwah: lol
[1:09:18] jacobk1114: the way i understood it was payment was agreed on for a given project but rob went to look at it and it wasnt what he had sent over to begin with so rob didnt want to pay him then paid him to leave, might not be right but thats how i understood it as it happend
[1:09:19] banReddit: KEKW
[1:09:20] gong_jeon: are you guys still doing the glass storefront?
[1:09:22] Raheat_: apparently*
[1:09:22] chompin_cheddar: its lookin good
[1:09:25] TheEyeVII: ok
[1:09:28] voxlegis: @dettadetta__ bro are you really trying to say being active is bad for you??? the most dense take lmao.
[1:09:30] Turgon478: i mean who argues with rob rob is so reasonable
[1:09:32] hrafnagut: yeah it feels like a major miscommunication cause rob seems nice
[1:09:40] wafflecone369: what about Kirby forging on an anvil
[1:09:44] CursedWang: miz probably tried to haggle with him and failed Kappa
[1:09:44] Raheat_: @jacobk1114 thats pretty accurate
[1:09:47] malakai00_: Yeah it's odd
[1:09:47] chompin_cheddar: such is life
[1:09:50] break_the_bone: You weren't the one handling the situation
[1:09:52] renzsee: @CursedWang miz wasnt even there
[1:09:55] shadeleamun: it should be a WOW BRD style design tunnel
[1:09:56] Catmistry: I liked the armadillo art and the artist was nice
[1:10:04] wafflecone369: mob the whole iron forge blah blah
[1:10:04] jh9844: hope he doesn‚Äôt come back and tag up the armadillo
[1:10:04] johnnyi215: @FrostyTide13 @FrostyTide13 i think he was gonna do his tag for free but actual art would have cost money which is fair
[1:10:12] kebbin: Yeah what is up with this Kirby thing? LOL
[1:10:14] D__Clone: y‚Äôall are going to get sued over Kirby
[1:10:15] Raheat_: I'm not sure why the obsessions w/ kirby
[1:10:16] wonur1gf: Are you a fan of super hot peppers?

[1:10:21] SeminoleGamer: HEY you will love Kirby!
[1:10:21] Imprisoned_Fetus: i like kirby but its kinda dumb for a gym
[1:10:23] ericparentart: it's going to be a shitshow no matter what lmao
[1:10:23] hrafnagut: is miz farming or does he really want artwork he can get sued over
[1:10:24] Raheat_: it seems like a priority
[1:10:25] zenyatta: @jh9844 i feel like yall are projecting your pettiness on professionals
[1:10:26] Shenron69420: the last time i was here, wake barely managed to crack 1K, i'm proud and happy to see the growth brother
[1:10:28] gong_jeon: the armadillo art looks too amateur

[1:10:40] Raheat_: don't get me wrong though, swole kirby would be cool
[1:10:46] hahn8solo: talk to miz then, he told him to draw anime and nintedno shit everywhere
[1:10:46] rusty_rooster: paint the wall to look like a lego wall
[1:10:47] uliloves: should do a luka/mavericks mural
[1:10:49] johnnyi215: Gamersups would probably give you permission to use their IP
[1:10:50] depaztest: with all the shit going on, the cum wall sounds decent now
[1:10:51] Elysianlight: @FrostyTide13 that makes sense, his adult swim murals were probably like 100k
[1:10:51] JuiceGodAlpha: mhm
[1:10:53] mrwaddle6: What happened with the guy who was tagging the wall with his name?
[1:10:54] ericparentart: just do nothing then lmao

[1:11:31] Uther_The_Lightbringer: then put ironforge logo on wall
[1:11:33] Elysianlight: @ArCiele did they ever say they were? I remember a mockup of that from miz's reddit. But I doubt landlord would allow it
[1:11:34] johnnyi215: @Elysianlight yeah, thats what i was thinking....some of his murals are like 6 figures, he doesn't want to be paid in exposure there had to be some serious miscommunication
[1:11:35] maiouxmaioux: it'd be beautiful too
