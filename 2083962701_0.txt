[0:35:14] Stephen126: People are ignorant as a Mr k viewer I enjoyed the rp yesterday and no one should be spreading hate on any of the streamers
[0:35:14] Flunez: what happen last night?

[0:35:41] DaviMury: Frost did imo
[0:35:42] grizrd: but u acted like that
[0:35:42] Loth_nl: Could you give a recap about what happened? @EsfandTV
[0:35:42] mattchutt: everything needed to be presented to him at the start. it was so back n fourth because slacks didnt have all his eggs the basket
[0:35:42] Moobs_: agreed, but still think the pd gun charge was a stretch
[0:35:42] smcclain: agree
[0:35:43] airsurgery: Duncan?

[0:35:47] TimmayHS: I was like pulling my hair out yelling at the screen "wtf are you dooooing Slacks!!??" @EsfandTV
[0:35:49] ArdentCause: Nopixel reddit was favorably on your side and felt bad because you essentially wanted to make K aware of all the charges that are VALID and slacks unfortunately pushed the process a bit too fast without realizing
[0:35:49] Awrelio97: Can you give a TLDR for those who missed it?
[0:35:50] treynrek: I agree woth that. But the other parties that got involved

[0:35:57] phaden_: Joel YOU Joel SPIN Joel ME Joel RIGHT Joel ROUND Joel BABY Joel RIGHT Joel ROUND Joel 󠀀
[0:35:58] papavicks: Ssaab trolled a bit but he wasn't trying to. Ultimately, K could've worked down charges but he didn't wanna play ball

[0:36:05] Chummy_Bear: Frost and the cadet did
[0:36:06] Dirt_Grub_: K was only upset he couldn't kidnap Cornwood
[0:36:06] TheEmmorf: You guys need to figure out a way to process in under 30min.
[0:36:06] K4shira: what the hell are you talking about
[0:36:06] bromonga: if doing RP properly and following the rules gets people mad it means the drama is good, like a book or TV show @EsfandTV
[0:36:06] Flunez: @EsfandTV what happen last night?
[0:36:06] kiolkjm: i passed out right when he was caught what was the out come chat and what were the overall time and charges
[0:36:07] JimmyNewf: mourn the lost story lines, but there is nothing to avenge

[0:36:17] StoryBookHD: ur my streamer and ur the only one who does RP mr.k is a filthy scum criminal that deserved what he got ReallyMad BabyRage
[0:36:17] kylef_: wait why was the possession charge still pushed?
[0:36:18] ExpedientMiner: Mr K thought was playing League and decided he needed intentional feed

[0:36:19] weyland_yutani_x: K just mad because 4.0 scuff struck again
[0:36:20] dapyman: Mr.  K had to hit a full send point at some point
[0:36:22] donny_dinosaur: ruths ghost possessed slacks and made him do it
[0:36:23] shae__void: slacks has a soft spot for CG which causes a big problem with consistency

[0:36:23] SmileLifeisGood: why not give him less charges and move on
[0:36:24] thevaultdweller55: in the end its the cops decision on the charges
[0:36:24] KnightyGaming: peepoJuiceSpin
[0:36:26] budlizzy826: Kevin really wanted to tell the story too... but then it just took so long
[0:36:26] MamaPr1m3: without going into interrogation
[0:36:27] NITWITdotTV: the -1000 speeches dont help

[0:36:30] icephrogg: it sucks mr k had to be charged 150k and 3 days in prison
[0:36:30] duckhunter_88: it was sort of a shit show
[0:36:30] EmDuBB13: @Zinzio it had to do with tessa?

[0:36:31] Mkay___: @esfandtv czan we get a quick recap, couldnt watch yesterday :(
[0:36:32] DaviMury: Ducann asking insta for the comission was so fucking funny KEKW
[0:36:32] lawlkat: can you recap? how'd it end? i had to crash @EsfandTV
[0:36:33] Aledz_: volcano hot
[0:36:33] icylemons1993: righ
[0:36:34] the1zac: "can you recap?" bro it was a 3 hour situation, theres VODs for a reason
[0:36:34] MesoClouds: mr.K feels like a beta tester ^^   why is  cg beeing isntandly processed with guncharges without GSR pos. and the judge is still free with 0 charges? with grs positiv?
[0:36:34] SilverASD: @EsfandTV What did you think was going to happen when you insisted on the charge being added?
[0:36:35] taffletv: I think the Cornwod special with showing the whole menu is really confusing for many
[0:36:36] fishslayer24: you were yappppppin
[0:36:36] Connorbrow: @papavicks It makes sense though, the character would rightfully be upset by the mishandling of the situation
[0:36:37] brude42: RIP 1911
[0:36:38] Smalls3122: hes kinda stupid to use that gun
[0:36:40] StreamElements: Printed Cases, Platelights, and Platelight panels have landed! 🌠starforgepc.com/Esfand
[0:36:41] treynrek: That wasn't the problem tho lol
[0:36:41] FeelsMelancholyMan: then gun being hot wasnt the issue
[0:36:42] mballin219: kidnapping is a big deal but he also had prev crimes
[0:36:42] xMike6: Someone else processed a hot gun in 30 mins
[0:36:42] timedoggg: gun charges hardly mattered to kidnapping you
[0:36:43] Ozryal: Gun was an ice cube....
[0:36:43] claptil: Literally assassinated council of 8
[0:36:44] HeyMeghan: respectfully K will never be a 30 min processing lmao he’s a silly lil guy
[0:36:45] dazchar: tbf $150k isnt that bad compared to the amount of crime he did. if he got caught for all crime prob around $1m-$1.5m in fines lol
[0:36:45] SPxTDG: oof lol
[0:36:45] grizrd: u  made it longer then it had to be from what i seen
[0:36:49] Awrelio97: Can you give a TLDR for those who missed it? @EsfandTV
[0:36:49] Hevs: over 2 hour charges except for murder are just dumb af
[0:36:49] callmefive: need to operate in two car units for a while
[0:36:50] TimmayHS: the moment y'all went into the interrogation room without everything sorted out, is the moment it went to shit @EsfandTV
[0:36:50] sevenonesmith: if it so hot why did he get less then other chargers
[0:36:50] ArdentCause: If they just let you pop out the charges properly and then work it down I truly believe that would have been less than 1 hour in that room
[0:36:50] dustiinos: @esfandtv  but the gun him using being molten hot didn’t matter the charges that stacked again him was from robbing you
[0:36:52] Dandulf: yea, that wasn't a 30 min kind of situation
[0:36:53] Zelfarso: shouldve just dropped some of the charges and got the craziest story ever from him
[0:36:54] ShadyMashX: If the other officers weren't there it would have gone smoother imo

[0:36:58] Endor: meow
[0:36:58] lowkey5arah: His intention was to kidnap you, not rob you. Taking that into consideration would have changed the charges
[0:36:58] rippsyrus: Charge stacking:  Classic No Pixel AHAHA
[0:36:58] Dregg0: judge Jackson

[0:37:03] Flunez: is this the thing with MR K?
[0:37:04] Hitmehn_: do you think DNA is too powerful with no way for crims to counter it?
[0:37:04] Zendorea: Mr K is mad about DNA when he has the Damn Gun on him... he knew better
[0:37:04] StreamElements: @esfandtv 💲 pkwhiz just donated $3.00: Had severe neck pain a few months ago and it ended up being crushed vertebrae without being in an accident. Should go get it checked out. Ended up getting my disks replaced
[0:37:04] BirdLauncher: I mean regardless of the charges being messed up K digging his heels in and refusing to work with you guys after that first messed up thing with the charges was on him not you all *shrug*
[0:37:04] SPxTDG: my mans wanted the 9s lol
[0:37:05] phaden_: Nessie COME Nessie ON Nessie DANCE Nessie DANCE Nessie DANCE Nessie
[0:37:05] panda_snack: was not being able to sign out scuff?
[0:37:05] KnightyGaming: Judy
[0:37:05] shikari07: Why would they even keep that gun KEKW like sell that shit
[0:37:05] mrbig_668: the hot gun charges were nothing compaired to the robbwery possesion stack
[0:37:08] K4shira: pls recap, you realize not everyone watched the full 15 hour stream yesterday...
[0:37:08] TheNotoriousKEV: oh SHIT it was the canter gun? AND JACKSON?
[0:37:09] Cobalt242: I wish it didn't drain our favorite creators as much as it seems like it does, RP has been so good, content keeps me hooked

[0:37:10] mballin219: k just unlucky and caughht
[0:37:10] ChromaticNova: @EsfandTV Cops didn't even run DNA which could have been other charges
[0:37:11] ValerianLuna: kitty
[0:37:12] Berserake: I still think they dont understand your point that present the charge and offer it to be dropped for a plea. The officers wanted to fully push it without dropping and slacks didnt want to push it but did anyways.
[0:37:12] Zinzio: @EmDuBB13 Yeah. Google "mr k tessa" its the first link
[0:37:12] lzrdwzrdtv: I NEED YOUUUUUUUUUUUU LETSGOOO wideNessie WideRaveTime
[0:37:13] timedoggg: Those charges were like 10% of the time lmao
[0:37:13] ScullzyTrolly: @EsfandTV Ya it was, you wanted to burry your nose in another captains process instead of letting him cook. You were a victim and didn't need to force all the other issues "for making sure it was done properly" Let it be.
[0:37:13] dustiinos: @esfandtv his gun being super hot was irrelevant the 2 charges from robbing you was 2880 months regardless
[0:37:13] FreakTheMedic: Cheer100 glad to see you’re ok after the kidnapping yesterday, Mr k lasted 24 hours after his pardon btw
[0:37:14] Xanathan420: devs need to revamp the charge times, like 12 hour max or something, 3 days is abit much
[0:37:14] wembyvictor: cops are op
[0:37:15] jinnytolls: The shooting of Cantar and Jackson was completely glossed over @EsfandTV
[0:37:15] shae__void: slacks just wanted to chit chat with dr. k and cut charged right off the bat, it was not good
[0:37:15] EmDuBB13: its not your fault. you tried to start it off right but it spiraled
[0:37:15] Protomateria: the fact that he kidnapped you in the first place and did it with a molten hot gun is wild LULW
[0:37:15] XanderOptik: if you guys had taken 10 more minutes to get on the same page about charges before interrogation it would have solved a lot of problems imo
[0:37:16] iMods: He got time served also, so that amount of time would have been in jail anyways
[0:37:17] Zelwaka: no one cares that he was caught
[0:37:18] NonToxicant: I didn't see what happened, but let me share my opinion of the situation really quick... Kappa
[0:37:18] papaswisha: It's the restock surely 😬😬😬😬
[0:37:18] Ozryal: Cornwood was 2900 minutes.... gun was 900 minutes.... gun was an ice cube...
[0:37:19] Blazematic: I understand what you was trying to do but the problem was yall went the wrong way about it by not explaining correctly and the fact that time was wasted to just go back to the original charges.
[0:37:19] OniCr0w: HandsUp
[0:37:20] RaicoP: Slacks was tryna let him go OMEGALUL
[0:37:20] KNGRSM: Murphy Braun

[0:37:22] God_is_a_cat_girl: just don't get caught 4Head
[0:37:22] Connorbrow: @rippsyrus It was clarified by a judge that it wasn't stacking

[0:37:23] drummeriss: GTA
[0:37:23] OtsoLupo: K was upset by the scuff, sure, but then he tried to make some rp out of the negotiations in interrogation but it literally went no where

[0:37:26] bobbybeee: jackson
[0:37:26] Mickow94: @ChromaticNova they did
[0:37:27] Crazziee_R_I_P: it’s a bit weird the current holder gets charged with ever other crime on the gun though
[0:37:27] thatdonkeyy: The RP that was missed cause of not being able to sign out sucked too on top of all that. It was gonna be so great and it went so bad
[0:37:28] StickUpKing: Got caught because of scuff
[0:37:28] THE_GIGACHAD_OF_TWITCH: HandUp
[0:37:28] Chrisaroo_: From an RP stand point is was entertaining but it was a ppo questioning a captain which felt a bit odd

[0:37:41] fr3nchvanillaa: Just don't stack bruh
[0:37:41] DavidGavin55: it hit the rails when Mr K could hear y’all discussing the process.
[0:37:42] MamaPr1m3: buttt couldnt it also be fought that u cant prove he did the other cases? lets say he got that gun the day off??

[0:37:46] kryles: just got out of a meeting, i miss anything chat? Also what podcast did esfand mean?
[0:37:46] kvnater: Watching both strems. My take is all the charges should have been discussed prior to talking to mrk. offering a deal then coming back with the charges seperated and still offering the same deal as initially offerd.
[0:37:47] itsGenovah: itsGenovah subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! Hope you get feeling better... I've been having shoulder pain lately can relate.

[0:37:49] Cobalt242: it was THE GUN, like that phone call Ramme got at the wedding
[0:37:50] Vosy1984: the pushing of the charges was weird, from 1000+ to 3000+
[0:37:50] Dregg0: Kebun explained it well last night. someone gave him a good RP opportunity so he went with it even though it was risky
[0:37:51] eichenlaubm: so excited for the podcast!

[0:38:02] yunglustha: at least my streamer got the W MrDestructoid
[0:38:03] widbar: kidnap cornwood w/ downed officer next to him with a molten hot gun LUL it's just badly planned.

[0:38:08] Caml0st: i thought you were entirely correct trying to follow the law; as well as you wanted to use officer discretion and lower the charges <3
[0:38:08] DaltonIRL: He seemed most annoyed about the sign off thing, he wasn't aware you couldnt sign off there
[0:38:08] SIeeptic: more than anything I’m sure it was the 3 days that got some many people riled up @esfandtv

[0:38:11] Mayorthis555: He is so good tho he will find RP content to make in prison tho
[0:38:11] jinnytolls: Learn from this going forward. 1. Take the questions and discussion away from the crim 2. Articulate the story in full with charges before going into interegation so you can negotiate it properly 3. Be ready for K to throw mud 4. Dont reveal names of judges infront of crim 5. Dont do the crime if you arent prepared to do the time. 6. Don't be afraid of the criminals threats 7. Jail RP is RP even if it needs to be improved.  @EsfandTV
[0:38:11] Mickerson2: is Kebun doing the podcast?
[0:38:12] sinisterschwag: did you happen to see what ramee's doing in jail? lol
[0:38:12] Connorbrow: @OtsoLupo It wasn't scuff, he took him to an unmanned, inoperable station.
[0:38:13] NonToxicant: makes sense
[0:38:13] MamaPr1m3: @Dregg0 agreed
[0:38:14] keterych: It shows how henerous y'all really are when dropping charges

[0:38:15] warmcorn: who is ron mexico
[0:38:15] shae__void: blau’s podcast chat
[0:38:16] lowkey5arah: His intention was to kidnap you, not rob you. Taking that into consideration would have changed the charges
[0:38:17] shermz4: the upsetting part from the outside was he wasnt kidnapping to rob and suffered the punishment from all the other robberies kinda ‘boy cried wolf’ thing

[0:38:23] SeriousBeardCPC: Cheer100 I think people don't understand that you are trying to fix a PD problem and it sucks Mr. K got stuck in the middle but the procedures need fixed
[0:38:23] ittie: Whats the podcast?
[0:38:24] munchkiin_: The decisions K did were very dumb for someone who is supposed to be a mastermind. Like why do crime so quickly after getting a pardon?

[0:38:29] SilverASD: @Dregg0 Right Tessa had an RP situation planned out
[0:38:29] Zinzio: Do you know OOC what Mr. K's intentions were? He didn't want to rob you. He was trying to RP a story with Tessa.

[0:38:57] Chrisaroo_: gm sheriff
[0:38:57] Blazematic: Yes but mistakes were made already so charges given already shouldve been the start and explained to K that this is what it shouldve been
[0:38:58] nebxhelix: spam robbing sani a g6 was ego act
[0:38:59] deadbyhunting: @EsfandTV But how do you convince someone like Slacks that possession should have been a charge when I feel like at the end he still wasn't convinced.  Until they know what should/shouldn't be charged, the definition of "all the charges" is always going to be different and be a problem
[0:39:00] Crankt_: oh 3k minutes wasnt enough LULW they could do more OMEGALAUGHING
[0:39:00] KnightyGaming: monkaW
[0:39:00] christianrecore20: I love your streams bro keep it up!
[0:39:00] iTolstak: That should have been made clear to slacks in the first place, i think he was too busy trying to minimize the charges from the beginning to understand what you were trying to do
[0:39:00] bb_woo: Can't work with k an ramee they toons are designed to be stubborn 😎
[0:39:01] StreamElements: @esfandtv 💲 xShatterspike just donated $5.00: Much Love from K's Stream, I agree with you 100% on presenting ALL charges first then taking away. He wasn't mad at you OOC at all he was chilling "trying to RP " the story out. He was just done with it all at a certain point. But you did well Cornwood!
[0:39:02] comrade_rabbitt: ghost is back
[0:39:02] KEKW_Sadge: ya i have them neck problems 1 or 2 times a year , hope you get better soon esfandCOPS
[0:39:03] IForgot2Prime: hidden room Pog
[0:39:04] Vexamas: @EsfandTV I think a part of the problem is communication - You kept saying "Difference between purposing and pursuing" which IS true, but he wasn't getting it - you should have pivoted instead of hammering the same words
[0:39:04] Ram_Ranch69: aaaaaaaaaaaaaa
[0:39:04] Bear_Otter: I feel it would have been better to let Slacks handle that last night, then take it up with him later to explain. Rather than have that debate in front of a crim
[0:39:05] jacksmithcje: the problem is to kidnap a cop you have to rob them otherwise they can just shoot as soon as you flee
[0:39:05] HeyitsPoohbear: is the podcast as Esfand or Cornwood lol
[0:39:06] heartasnack: Yeah the problem was the starting time that he thought he was working down from was 2x lower then what he actually got. Charges needed to be correct before going into that room.
[0:39:07] Janman88: to be real honest here: for like 3 months fuckery thats a pretty short prison time?

[0:39:11] Supibot: eeyley, Your daily cookie: Use your instincts now.
[0:39:12] sir_rekt: The GTA RP clips sub on reddit was siding with Cornwood for the most part. But there was still a lot of "but my streamer" type comments because their streamer got caught

[0:39:18] Rapanui_: @EsfandTV do you think there should have been more taken off for a guilty plea? 󠀀
[0:39:20] XanderOptik: @Connorbrow he did ask Cornwood about it before going there though. it's still not scuff but he had reason to believe they'd be able to sign out there.

[0:39:51] Swabbers: Mr K wasnt exactly cooperating so that draged the whole thing out a bit aswell, i mean he litterally wanted everything dropped and i think that would have been just very unrealistic

[0:39:58] jinnytolls: Learn from this going forward. 1. Take the questions and discussion away from the crim 2. Articulate the story in full with charges before going into interegation so you can negotiate it properly 3. Be ready for K to throw mud 4. Dont reveal names of judges infront of crim 5. Dont do the crime if you arent prepared to do the time. 6. Don't be afraid of the criminals threats 7. Jail RP is RP even if it needs to be improved.

[0:41:18] Achilles42O: bro your rp is top tier man your ideas are great and when others rp alongside you it’s great to watch, big love brother
[0:41:19] Cthyllah: he had been trying to do it for like 3 days lol
[0:41:19] SilverASD: @NoxintheBox god forbid people dont talk in emojis
[0:41:19] bobbybedstains: hows he to know
[0:41:19] XanderOptik: I think most viewers and Kebun OOC know that you weren't trying to be malicious but from Mr. K's perspective in character it may have looked that way. @EsfandTV
[0:41:21] ExpedientMiner: you should tell extra officers to go patrol when they start stacking in processing. i know folks are helping but it doesnt take a huddle of cops
[0:41:21] MamaPr1m3: he rushed it
[0:41:21] amBrint: EMS Snitches
[0:41:23] MesoClouds: rip they crazy rp it would ahve followed :(
[0:41:24] PlummyOW: peepoWave
[0:41:25] CowWizardMoneyGang: poorly planned
[0:41:25] itsNudeGrandpa: I have a feeling that a lot of RP viewers/chatters don't know what RP Is
[0:41:26] xDinkleBot: YEP EMS was just pulling up
[0:41:26] izaaad: why did you even get invloved with charges??????????????
[0:41:26] TheNilknarf: That crew just acts like they’re above everything and always the victims when the get caught up.
[0:41:28] Map_Of_Your_Head: lol
[0:41:28] strawhat3d2y_93: you were just trying to help so they couldn’t add charges later that would’ve pissed k off even more. that’s what I thought at least
[0:41:28] KNGRSM: @EsfandTV do some prisoner Rehabilitation with K
[0:41:28] MattadinGaming: One dude in chat = chat
[0:41:30] Swabbers: @DaltonIRL Agree
[0:41:30] Redtwintails: @panda_snack well...he kidnapped him at put him to gunpoint lol
[0:41:30] munchkiin_: was the kidnapping yesterday btw?
[0:41:30] enser27: tried for 3 days
[0:41:32] Sprokkitt: he didnt fuck up - he was just super unlucky
[0:41:34] kylef_: EMS GIGACHAD
[0:41:36] Prepper_Jack: Don't think Esfand was being malicious, but the PD being the victim, prosecutor, judge, jury, executioner is not a fair system, especially when you're stacking charges like a hard nosed prosecutor, which is intended to intimidate criminals into plea deals, and not a reflection of what they'd get sentenced to in reality
[0:41:36] CaveManBk: they tried for 3 days
[0:41:36] privatestars: he also thought you could sign out at other police stations
[0:41:37] Pravolution: Good script
[0:41:38] RTJ_Drops: ITS THE SAME type of person, just ridiculous

[0:41:40] Vosy1984: @EsfandTV do you think that if you could go off-duty, the event would've work?
[0:41:40] HazyHung: once you guys mentioned the 1400 months originally it was all over. adding charges after that was just never gonna make it better
[0:41:41] sircrumpler: Sludge
[0:41:41] shermz4: he had been waiting for days and that was the only sliver so he acted
[0:41:42] budlizzy826: He was waiting for over 3 days
[0:41:43] brude42: free donuts Pog
[0:41:43] Duesbout: It was a bad plan and bad plans can fail and there are consequences
[0:41:43] Fozenoh: Mr K could have just gave you a call and Cornwood would go there LUL No need for guns and shit
[0:41:44] PlummyOW: New Order Pog
[0:41:44] Freddiepines: Poorly executed PepoG
[0:41:45] mrclean1222: did any pd check to see if his dna was on any previous reports
[0:41:45] PsychoJoker: @amBrint They are gov employees what are you even on about
[0:41:46] KaylonGrace: with EMS arriving it was just an easy call to the PD
[0:41:46] soulecco: KKornwood
[0:41:47] gguy245: SBS kicked in
[0:41:48] ZuldeadTV: yeah to be fair the situation got to that point because of a LOT of factors. Literally everything went wrong
[0:41:49] Rapanui_: @EsfandTV do you think there should have been more taken off for a guilty plea?
[0:41:49] Amo_Zzz: I think it's pretty obvious just by spending some time here that you don't have a malicious bone in your body
[0:41:50] TheNotoriousKEV: @EsfandTV its true, he should know that if youre standing next to a downed officer that the PD would already be on alert, and when EMS rolled up they should have bailed
[0:41:50] Ozryal: @EsfandTV I see it a bit differently.... I don't think the charges mattered.... you could have told K that he tried to steal the moon and given him 1 minute.  On the other side he kicked a rock and gets charge 3000 minutes.
[0:41:50] MamaPr1m3: the saw cornwood and took advantage they should of waited for more of there boys etc
[0:41:51] CatmanJay: the Mr K hate here is craazy in chat..
[0:41:51] DungeonLocal: @EsfandTV do you think the dna system is unfair ? because there is no other way to counter it from the crim pov
[0:41:51] realsneakerr: Im pretty sure the biggest dilemma Mr K had was that they "pressed" charges and then added more after, after getting more evidence
[0:41:52] spexs_5: Sadge i wish we could just move on 󠀀
[0:41:54] KnightyGaming: Sludge TeaTime
[0:41:54] Heyitsnoxx: how was charging him with the PD gun fair but not charging that judge assistant who was GSR positive and gun in hand????
[0:41:54] munchkiin_: @shae__void exactly the day after a pardon?????
[0:41:55] Comicman108: @EsfandTV actually they literally just saw u by accident there wasnt planned at that time
[0:41:55] 0xC0FFFEEE: Slacks is just bad at command position.
[0:41:56] akn8iv: how many other crims did y’all catch last week without the name CG in it?
[0:41:57] the1zac: yeah they did tbh, they took advantage of the opportunity of you by yourself but they werent planning to do it when they did
[0:41:58] THiiLLY: @m__wolfe he wasn’t mad at the consequences
[0:41:58] RoxyA87: exemClap exemClap exemClap

[0:42:01] kylef_: anyone calling EMS snitches doesn't understand the meaning of the word snitch
[0:42:02] Rey40fp: @izaaad you should really reconsider your life choices
[0:42:04] NoxintheBox: @SilverASD tldr LULW
[0:42:04] Ceebz89: Sludge nymnCorn
[0:42:05] V3NCHEl2: officer down, EMS rolling up, other officers patroling the area because of that damned black buffalo!
[0:42:05] AivHell: 4Shrug You never go off duty , so it's hard to kidnap you xdd
[0:42:05] HeyMeghan: Cornwood was trying to prevent exactly what happened.
[0:42:06] Kalious78: @esfandtv hed already gone in n done started it all, those charges where pretty flimsy/bs anyway you should never have pushed n argued for an hour+ over it
[0:42:07] Mickow94: same
[0:42:07] wavy__________________: Ruth wasn't the problem
[0:42:08] warmcorn: have you been playing SOD at all?
[0:42:08] shae__void: @munchkiin_ KEKW YES
[0:42:10] RaicoP: Slacks shouldnt be a captain after that
[0:42:10] BasApan: @EsfandTV Kevin was just mostly mad about the fact you can remove the GPS tracker in a reasonable way.
[0:42:11] Zelwaka: he tried for 3 hours
[0:42:13] shikari07: essaying
[0:42:13] devils_lettuce956: It wasn't planned they stumbled on you driving even tho he said he wanted to get you off duty
[0:42:14] sircrumpler: He goin in forever
[0:42:14] DirtyDulay: EZ
[0:42:15] psys1s: Its all because of the dolphin
[0:42:15] MrChow223: i think if you kept it between you, slacks and Duncan it would have been a lot better
[0:42:15] treynrek: But in character...Mr K isn't like that
[0:42:16] KnightyGaming: esfandExplaining
[0:42:16] SPxTDG: you looking  at the 9s son
[0:42:16] EmeraldTiger888: yeh HUGE moment
[0:42:17] MoohamedAlii: yeah his ego got him should 've bailed
[0:42:18] tarzandaking: You should have walked in been like hold on captain we might have more since his DNA just hit on these items might have smoothed it but they have to put all the charges out first
[0:42:18] Blazematic: @EsfandTV You say this but the fact that yall went up on charges cuz they needed to be corrected but yall took to long
[0:42:18] BasApan: cant*
[0:42:19] Highest_Anxiety: It was but slacks was rushing it
[0:42:20] Mkay___: @esfandtv any chance for a quick recap, couldnt watch yesterday :(

[0:42:22] BigBlue31: Surely
[0:42:22] MoonPrsmSpoopy: if K's plan involved relying on an office that the pd doesn't work out of to function normally, then it wasn't a great plan tbh
[0:42:23] RaicoP: Hmm
[0:42:24] DaviMury: But cornwood discussing with slacks about the charges yesterday was what fucked up everything IMO
[0:42:24] HeyMeghan: @kylef_ right? they’re mandated reporters.
[0:42:24] munchkiin_: @shae__void I swear, Mr. K is so dumb ugh :/
[0:42:24] ZuldeadTV: yeah
[0:42:26] callmefive: But K don’t care
[0:42:28] shermz4: yeah lines of communication got crossed for sure
[0:42:28] HonestRazorback: K isnt mad at Cornwood at all
[0:42:29] timedoggg: he was till 3 hours and time doubled
[0:42:29] Downthrower: just got here. we still talking bout the k sitch??
[0:42:30] theLastMooninite: Saab's -100000 speech debuff ruined it
[0:42:30] Chummy_Bear: yes and because the order was fucked everyone lost that rp
[0:42:30] XanderOptik: Agreed. I think Slacks really messed up by rushing into the interrogation room.
[0:42:30] bobbybedstains: i dont care
[0:42:30] AnusReaktorMan: Slacks throwed
[0:42:31] BauR: @esfandtv Aldo gave Ruth Jr the 187 call sign doesn't that just add to the fact that they are her underlings even tho she resigned
[0:42:32] jeff0154567: stacking
[0:42:32] israpuli: he wanted to talk too
[0:42:32] LCOnline: how do you feel about the decision to shoot?
[0:42:32] Lite_Ice: yeah i think slacks messed it up
[0:42:33] RaicoP: 100%
[0:42:34] M__Wolfe: @THiiLLY Oh, I guess for me it all stemmed from that. Was he mad about the charges?
[0:42:34] emery_steele: slacks gave him reduced charges to begin with
[0:42:35] wembyvictor: then you fuck someone who brings alot of rp to the server
[0:42:36] kricket16: You were the victim. You shouldnt have been involved
[0:42:36] thatdonkeyy: He wanted to tell the story just for the RP
[0:42:36] KnightyGaming: Nessie esfandShowingYou

[0:42:43] jschrage10: because of the way they did it it made it look like things were getting stacked against him
[0:42:43] havefunuall: is this the first when cornwood is trying to make deal with mrk he never cares
[0:42:43] Tsilin: i know it't not real life, but should the victim of a crime be the one discussing or pushing charges?  maybe for RP reasons it does, not sure.
[0:42:46] Heyitsnoxx: how was charging him with the PD gun fair but not charging that judge assistant who was GSR positive and gun in hand????
[0:42:46] KaylonGrace: It's so weird to me how people try to project feelings from their favorite streamer than the streamer isn't even projecting. Why do people get so upset for someone when they're not the ones in RP?
[0:42:46] taffletv: @EsfandTV He wanted to make a deal to get the charges under 1 day cuz he didnt want the 3 days
[0:42:47] WastelanderB: Cornwood/ MrK prison visit needed
[0:42:48] Mindhysteria: imo slacks should never process CG
[0:42:51] EdibleBoxers: hi frank
[0:42:51] thealiien: @EsfandTV Wasnt he asking "TO give him the whole story" ie layout al the charges, slacks didnt want to do that
[0:42:52] treynrek: He was ready to do that in the first hour
[0:42:54] shae__void: Prayge let’s move past this Prayge

[0:42:58] Fozenoh: @DungeonLocal DNA dont work most of the time. It's not unfair
[0:43:00] viralostrich: @wembyvictor sit down and think about the fact that this is what you get upset about in life.

[0:43:05] Vosy1984: @EsfandTV do you think that if you could go off-duty, the event would've work? even with all the cops knowing you were kidnaped
[0:43:05] arcticOP: @heyitsnoxx they're investigating that still.
[0:43:06] NotXour: I don't think it was anybody fault, the information was presented poorly and K was frustrated and at the end of his rope. Learning experience.
[0:43:08] itzcookiebtw: was it wrong for you guys to charge him with all the charges related to the hot gun @EsfandTV? not like saying it was but just curious if you think it was right or if you all should've investigated further or anything.

[0:43:10] MahanGM: pre Sludge
[0:43:10] MrBASins: true MR K don't care
[0:43:11] DrWetbone: all 3 fled up. Mr k shouldn’t botch so much. slacks should have listened to cornwood. and cornwood shouldn’t talk down to captain in front of criminals
[0:43:11] shae__void: @mamapr1m3 more than a few
[0:43:11] CallMeEnki: You should order some pei pa koa, voice actors use it to help their throats
[0:43:12] joyofjackal: is your voice ok?
[0:43:13] Swabbers: His idea of a deal was just letting him go basicly, witch is just not very good RP either
[0:43:13] DJ_Bru: forsenDiscoSnake

[0:43:18] MrChow223: 3 hour yap session kinda killed the whole thing
[0:43:18] GordoComeDoritos: IMO the only thing cornwood did wrong was to be there processing being the victim, other than that, it's just fair to present every charge to him like you tried to do @EsfandTV
[0:43:19] PaulieBeanbags23: Tormented city for over 2 weeks, he got what was coming to him
[0:43:19] Cthyllah: he only wanted to talk if it was because he was making a deal and he had some sort of say or control in the matter. not if he felt like he was backed in a corner. he said that in his stream multiple times.
[0:43:19] jschrage10: you were right that they shouldn’t have talked about charges infront of him until everything was decided
[0:43:20] CatmanJay: how everyone EXPECTS MR K in character to know the station doesn’t work.. doesn’t make sense. Cornwood knew and could have told him that sooner tho
[0:43:20] lawlkat: can you recap? how'd it end? i had to crash @EsfandTV
[0:43:20] wavy__________________: is Cornwood still a business partner tho?
[0:43:21] killerpvm: slacks jumped the gun telling him charges
[0:43:21] EmeraldTiger888: days worth of letting other peoples RP play out led to him Finally getting his turn and then it gets donowalled

[0:43:37] Taurus1X: When you mentioned that you were trying to help him and do right by him I think it put the wrong idea in his head. Like you said you were going to lay out all the charges and then cut them down. But when Slacks said he's dropping the possession charge and then you tried to show that it could/should be applied he was caught by surprise and felt backstabbed

[0:44:22] HeyMeghan: imo k was trying to jump to the end and slacks already had so they were both rushing it and it turned into a shit show.
[0:44:22] xGameShock: He wanted a deal that roleplay came from him sharing stories and provided content but didnt want to have a jail stream. He was fine with a fine but didnt want a jail stream.

[0:44:24] therealbattyboo: the only real bummer of all of that is not getting him to explain the why...could have led to some fun RP
[0:44:24] DaviMury: Slacks was too soft, but the discussion between the two of you changed the interrogation for worst

[0:44:24] silver91: I think the problem is that there are a couple of sweaty cops that just slam him with every charge they can that it has brought everything to the point where once hes arrested its just game over
[0:44:25] BaconPhatt: I just want to party all the time though
[0:44:25] jeremyks9: Cops need the criminals for the fun just a game but he tried to RP it out

[0:44:26] RikB55: Great playlist @esfandtv
[0:44:27] facelessXfactor: Chat is wrong he was mad because the pd gun charge was not listed at the start so he wanted to talk down 1000m then it became 3000m so it went backwards
[0:44:28] zdrago666: toonyH toonyH toonyH toonyH toonyH toonyH toonyH toonyH toonyH

[0:44:31] Highest_Anxiety: He didn't "have the gun." His DNA was on it. There's a difference.

[0:44:32] chaosdunking: DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance
[0:44:33] almostgoth: @EsfandTV  Im a K sub and you were doing it correct.    YOu must present all charges at the beginning or your barganing doesnt start at the correct spot
[0:44:33] HonestRazorback: K was just upset about the tracker. That's it!

[0:44:36] EZScuderia: @savixlikesitfrombehind you tagged to wrong guy g
[0:44:37] jacksmithcje: i dont get the argument of the gun in the river not on him because he even said you put it on the floor so he had to get the gun in the glovebox or leave it outside so it shows intent
[0:44:37] RaicoP: u were right with showing every charge first
[0:44:37] blimpguy: the whole situation was ruined when you first offered a deal, the chronology was broken from the jump
[0:44:41] masternotorious: @EsfandTV i'm not taking sides on this issue, but are you guys no longer RP'ing that DNA can't be washed away in the ocean or streams?

[0:44:46] Athos1000: No way is Esfand so fucking deep into this RP Aware
[0:44:46] realsneakerr: honestly believe the majority of the blame should go on slacks for jumping the gun on everything and rushing it. HOWEVER Cornwood should have just stepped away after they started arguing the charges in the interrogation room

[0:44:49] shae__void: @slickwilllay kidnapped cornwood with a gun. stole his gun. evaded. chief called for open fire.

[0:45:15] thespicymeat_: to  be fair. cornwood was the victim so probably shouldnt have been in there
[0:45:15] leetz23: The only issue is the fact that charges (reduced) were presented early.. just got off on the wrong foot

[0:45:31] ShadyMashX: He did say everything ur saying except tessa
[0:45:31] Moobs_: he was fine with spending the initial day in prison, but 3 days of prison RP where no one is around is frustrating
[0:45:32] Taurus1X: When you mentioned that you were trying to help him and do right by him I think it put the wrong idea in his head. Like you said you were going to lay out all the charges and then cut them down. But when Slacks said he's dropping the possession charge and then you tried to show that it could/should be applied he was caught by surprise and felt backstabbed
[0:45:32] Zelwaka: @EdibleBoxers ReallyMad
[0:45:33] SupertuxAFK: I don’t think you need to explain Cornwoods actions. I understand the situation and the rp opportunities.
[0:45:33] Half_Ghost: which to be fair he did say that but like you said it was too late already and putting charges back on triggerd mrK, you called what was going to happen
[0:45:33] munchkiin_: @xGameShock it doesnt make sense because what he did was jail worthy, he should have done something smaller than kidnaping a cop.
[0:45:35] SleepShot: he said that

[0:45:35] Lets_Go_Huskers: In this case why wasnt it just kidnapping, thats what he was attempting to do
[0:45:36] Prepper_Jack: @Rage1_1 easier to ask what he didn't get charged with
[0:45:36] RietArtwork: It would have been better for the PD too, Mr. K would have incriminated more gang members telling the story from all the charges
[0:45:36] FreakTheMedic: k messed up, that’s the end of it
[0:45:36] forceflexx1122: You're a cop tho he was gonna take ur pd gear and turbo, what then?
[0:45:36] SilverASD: he said that in the interrogation and no one asked
[0:45:37] PaulieBeanbags23: He killed cops for a week, kidnapped cornwood... uall crazy thinking he didn't deserve this
[0:45:38] Thrill_505: Slacks wouldnt care either way he just wanted to charge him
[0:45:39] ogwookie: after 2800
[0:45:42] shae__void: slacks should take some law classes imho
[0:45:43] SwpAndrei: getting fired is not as the same as being in jail !! thats the on;y prob i have with what u said, but u were right and did nothing wrong , infact its good maybe now that people seen this will change those idiotic charges
[0:45:43] lawlkat: can you recap? how'd it end? i had to crash @EsfandTV
[0:45:44] kvnater: agreed! however he was already offered a deal to talk. then to just seperate charges and come back and offer to get back to the same deal was frustating. IMO

[0:45:46] splooshtasticals: He was heated by u in character tbf. Was also trying to kidnap so not in the right mindset.
[0:45:46] MrChow223: the other charges are like no time in comparison though
[0:45:46] CallMeEnki: I think its funny cuz they could have just called you for a meeting and baited you without kidnapping LUL
[0:45:46] millerlight44: wernt you getting shot for being to easy with Mr.K the other day with the group 6 trucks? lol. @esfandtv
[0:45:47] evermike: I feel having a 1 on 1 with him off duty at jail would be good content
[0:45:48] peepochill: @Fozenoh yes
[0:45:48] Themessias1001: @EsfandTV Slacks took accountability for his mistake.
[0:45:48] wavy__________________: even more stacked charges is wild

[0:45:55] phaden_: SOMEHOW RUTH HAS RETURNED? sajj
[0:45:56] Joeliodoss: It's not about the charges themselves, it's how much punishment a player IRL has to suffer because of a game. It's supposed to be a content server, right? Crim RP is not conducive to NP right now.
[0:45:57] TheBull14597: if you had shot him at the police station when he put his gun down, this would have happened... just saying Kappa
[0:45:57] SilverASD: @forceflexx1122 that was not the intent
[0:45:59] zdrago666: geegaDab geegaHi geegaHi geegaHi geegaHi geegaHi

[0:46:03] sir_rekt: Slacks immediately trying to drop charges before you'd all agreed on the charges was the issue, since that made it seem like Cornwood was adding stuff on. And that's what a lot of people watching LordKebun don't seem to understand
[0:46:03] Chrisaroo_: And was pardoned by the mayor.
[0:46:03] Themessias1001: @EsfandTV hell CG was robbing Sani for weeks.
[0:46:05] shae__void: @lawlkat mr. k got locked up for like 3 days.
[0:46:05] GigitySponges: GREEN SCREEN green screen Green screen GREEN SCREEN Green screen GREEN SCREEN
[0:46:06] Caml0st: if he talked more; he could have linked another molten gun in pd evidence to himself by accident though; talking could have made it worse

[0:46:07] devils_lettuce956: But they don't know he killed the cops LUL
[0:46:07] MahanGM: RUTH IS BACK UHMM
[0:46:07] RaicoP: slacks screwed u over for sure
[0:46:07] Diamondman121314: @havefunuall cornwood isn’t a streamer
[0:46:08] ScullzyTrolly: @EsfandTV Taking too messages out of context. Not every chatter is in their feelings malding. I don't care about Mr.k Just objective facts. It's like reprimanding an employee in front of a customer the way you tried to push procedure, while being victim, while slacks was pushing charges.
[0:46:08] MamaPr1m3: when k is like that though its hard u cant reason with him especially if he knows how to mess you up
[0:46:09] Xeno_phile: expunged btw xdd
[0:46:10] cSpiny: @MrDher https://prnt.sc/uZxB0wu2Ttg0 i got u
[0:46:12] elusivetreecko: But you kept pushing even tho slacks said why he didnt add the charge @EsfandTV so you should have talked to slacks after the fact instead of going back and adding it
[0:46:12] DoseofDewey: yeah he was sloppy
[0:46:12] CptDizzy: is it a simulation or RP
[0:46:12] pr0digy_1: Much love Esfand kebunBlue kebunCG kebunBlue kebunCG we appreciate the RP
[0:46:13] 55Hoes: he was Roleplaying
[0:46:13] CatmanJay: so EZ to say K just deserves punishment but when Cornwood was about to get murder talk was wildin lol
[0:46:13] ExpedientMiner: people have a hate boner for digital crime
[0:46:13] WyattKB: I think at the end of the day shit happens, its a little frustrating from K’s end because the potential RP coming out of the kidnapping would have been potentially awesome but again shit happens and something even better could come out of this prison arc for K. I look at it all as a movie, we just have to sit back and see how the story unfolds
[0:46:14] hoanzlgoas: if you want to have things play out this way you have to script it i guess

[0:46:15] Kevz95: i think he would have been super aggressive just hearing the 3700 minutes to begin with. whether or not it was there from the beginning or some added after. He was more pissed about the length than anything.
[0:46:16] MahanGM: UHMM  RUTH IS BACK UHMM

[0:46:18] munchkiin_: @phaden_ no? where? she resigned from PD
[0:46:20] jschrage10: slacks never should have started trying to make a deal until all the charges were set
[0:46:20] MrPRINCE______: you cant win man SAJ
[0:46:21] The13Rookie: he got charged for 3200+ and 154k with 400 off for sitting waiting

[0:46:36] xGameShock: @munchkiin_ Yeah and you understand its a RP server for RP? A nopixel admin gave him a mission because that Person wanted RP, K wanted to help provide RP for that admin and part of that was getting cornwood kidnapped. He did a crime for RP and content not for personal gain and now he sits in jail for days

[0:47:06] theLastMooninite: @EsfandTV taking an officer you kidnapped to ANOTHER POLICE OFFICE is bad RP to begin with tbh
[0:47:06] ogwookie: lol

[0:47:12] Cthyllah: he said multiple times in his stream that he wanted to leave there feeling like he was making a deal and had a say in what charges were being pushed, he said he wasnt going to talk if the cops were going to try to push him into a corner to force him to talk.

[0:47:18] salvi9: K doesn’t know the other PDs aren’t operational. he though it was a scuff that you couldn’t sign out
[0:47:18] afcheesy: I mean Slacks says he wants to make a deal then 3 hours later he almost doubles his time and money cost.
[0:47:19] davesacook: I think the problem is the time and fine for certain crimes.
[0:47:19] MoonPrsmSpoopy: Tbf K and Cornwood had a good enough relationship that he could've asked to see if the offices up north were functional before relying on something like that
[0:47:21] Prepper_Jack: or, don't make a sign in book be a permanent tracking agent.. make that your radio or something
[0:47:22] shosher: @esfandtv HE WANTED TO GO TO SANDY PD BUT HE SAW THE CAR YOU GUYS PARKED THERE AND WENT TO POLEDO

[0:47:33] Fozenoh: Maybe so you cant duty on and off from anywhere? Pause @EsfandTV
[0:47:33] kronostw: Signing in and off should be an F1 Command. SHouldnt need to go to a desk to do it
[0:47:33] ZuldeadTV: dutyoff could've saved that entire situation ICANT
[0:47:34] BeauHundo: they removed it for that very rearson
[0:47:35] wildbur91: he Got upset cuz of the tracker situation didnt work on the paleto pd and then he Got upset over you guys presented that 1 Day charges, without all the other charges that Got added on later while he was trying to work out a deal and felt like he just Got fucked. he was gonna talk in the start and work out a deal. was a Dam gum shit show KEKW
[0:47:36] nathankb_: it's a little powerful to kidnap a cop and then magically make their blip disappear
[0:47:36] Tuturruu_: dutyon only exists for headpops in the first place
[0:47:37] Kaztiell: its cause officers got kidnapped all the time, so they had to get rid of it to make it harder @EsfandTV
[0:47:37] quixan_: Maybe they got rid of it so you can't force someone to sign out to be kidnapped
[0:47:37] wembyvictor: the reason 4.0 came out was because onx came out

[0:47:54] Heyitsnoxx: whatever on the charges, he should not have been shot
[0:47:54] Downthrower: its because its a power move to remove trackers. signing out of your job doesnt make you disappear
[0:47:55] jifjam: it all stemming from that lie from crashing
[0:47:55] heyomiki: idk why people are making it such a big deal. The only thing messed up in the situation is the 3 days thing, its like a mini ban. The rp is fine, if anything this will lead to a good story
[0:47:55] RoxyA87: sodaModcheck
[0:47:56] HeyMeghan: he thinks it’s scuff you can’t sign out in Paleto but it’s not they just haven’t set it up yet. scuff means something isn’t functioning when it should be right?

[0:48:06] inducedcatharsis: @EsfandTV If he had just gone to Sandy like he originally wanted to, I wonder how this whole thing could have played out differently
[0:48:07] DividiaDarktide: @EsfandTV What was the whole point of him trying to get Cletus to sign out?  What would that have accomplished?
[0:48:07] treynrek: The problem is its so hard to find you off duty. He got sloppy with waiting
[0:48:07] RoxyA87: it was max RNG

They could have totally RP'd around to get you off duty some way. Just tell Cornwood to come eat some gluten and hamburgers or something, Cornwood might have not suspected anything, but I believe Esfand would have gone for the RP Cheer200

He couldnt sign you off easily and then he gets 3 days because of the ways the server laws are. It makes any content with cops impossible unless its them getting arrested.

[1:24:36] thephatman: there’s literally ppl who call Ramee a misogynist and say that all of CG are shitty humans because of their RP characters.

[2:14:18] itzcookiebtw: @ZuldeadTV yea i mean the timing and the fact she was there and not "unconscious" then ems got there. it was just a mess as soon as that happened. i swapped to ssaabs stream after or like pulled it up and he was already flying to paleto following them.

[2:14:24] CronosBathory: Wtf does IRL matter, it's RP lmao, are we going to real life 2.0?
[2:14:24] Xanbry: It should be required for Crims to have a Cop character they play atleast once a week or a few times a month atleast   and Cops need to have a Civ character they are required to play once a week or atleast a few times a month to always have both perspectives.
[2:14:27] danski42: so funny that ramee has no idea how ballistics and serial numbers work when hes supposed to be a lawyer
[2:14:30] Lakers1nation: Lets move forward and talk about how MR K took over the interrogation
[2:14:32] PyroSapphire: Even in IRL a bullet fired from a gun has a individual signature to it
[2:14:35] itzcookiebtw: @Verion does he have a cop character in 4.0 or not yet?
[2:14:39] Sowiloo: @Snizzzy1 by definition Conflict of Interest
[2:14:45] shoootamcgavin: It is kind of ridiculous that murder is lesser of a fine than kidnapping or robbing the PD
[2:14:47] Verion: @itzcookiebtw not yet

[2:14:52] VopxD: @Verion not yet
[2:14:54] MadderHatter: bullets have like fingerprints, you can easily track guns if they've been used in multiple crimes, it's done all the time

[2:15:29] TheBusterScrugs: But k did want to rp it as a loss until changes kept being added and dropped and added again and backtracking then he stone walled you
[2:15:29] Reezalhub: @coldlightoracle LULE gud1
[2:15:34] permacool: @shoootamcgavin it has more to do with the level of involvement, not what the consequence is. shooting someone dead is less crime than stealing someone and kidnapping them for an extended period of time. does that make sense?

[2:15:58] fishmeatx: Joel Joel Joel Joel JoelJoel
[2:15:59] GloomzieHC: The middle of the situation was not the time, it came off as you pushing for a win that takes away from rp. It's bad rp cornwood you're wrong.
[2:16:00] RTJ_Drops: fuck i just got here, did i miss anything
[2:16:01] shoootamcgavin: @permacool yeah, I guess that makes sense
[2:16:02] timtheboneman: you're not wrong but you made yourself the main character and completely took over and argued for over an hour, which was wild

[2:16:17] EsfandTV: @timtheboneman, that wasn't making myself the main character pepeW
[2:16:18] Ashcheeksx: Nope you got it right. They try to speed it up for the crims and then they try to talk it down more when they already have them truncated down to speed things up
[2:16:19] mrs_strawberryy: GIGACHAD
[2:16:19] danski42: @HebrewOutlaw but it does so whether it is or is not supposed to it does so they play around the mechanics they have.
[2:16:21] IanDooleyTV: Actually an excellent re-cap of what happened.
[2:16:22] TimmayHS: @arckon Give Slacks DAPs
[2:16:26] Lakers1nation: @h00tywh0 is that our time? Wats that in hours?
[2:16:27] callmefive: prosecutors are missing
[2:16:37] permacool: @shoootamcgavin now lets say the cops uncover a motive, then the crime was premeditated and should be considered highly
[2:16:39] Ibiffo: if you want longer interactions then last night with K was the way to do it :(
[2:16:39] IanDooleyTV: It'd be nice to have another lawyer here!
[2:16:43] TwoHandedBells: @EsfandTV do this IRL PotFriend
[2:16:48] Lakers1nation: Whos talking

[2:16:55] ZireaelXV: BOY
[2:16:56] PacGamer: OOC
[2:16:57] lilCalha: PotFriend
[2:17:01] mukiwa18: Beric is talking.
[2:17:02] hekisan: ICC 25H
[2:17:02] Maz0hyst: @Lakers1nation Beric, PF Chief
[2:17:03] alexlipson: @GodSpeed_R there are other RP servers where the charges here are rookie numbers to what others charge. 7 day soft bans aren't uncommon if you fuck up big like this somewhere else.. but I agree 2 days of no Mr K is lackluster for the server
[2:17:03] sodrdie: 2 esfands?
[2:17:05] yaboiporkchop: chief of police beric johnson
[2:17:05] keemotherapi: @Lakers1nation Arckon (Beric)
[2:17:05] maxmolly: @timedoggg helping crims and future cops/lawyers understand the possession charge. ignoring and skipping over it doesnt help anyone
[2:17:07] IanDooleyTV: @Lakers1nation Chief of police.
[2:17:07] an_duuu: its like if youre bargaining, you dont start out with a compromise off the bat
[2:17:08] notlimah_: this man actually sounds like this o7
[2:17:08] Lucid_Jaydee: @Lakers1nation Beric, chief of police
[2:17:09] faroeislands_: I could listen to Beric talk all day, such a sultry voice
[2:17:10] magnus139: Beric is so good
[2:17:11] Toyola: Beric GIGACHAD
[2:17:13] Maz0hyst: @Lakers1nation PD Chief*
[2:17:13] dreez9: do you think that beric should have ordered cops to open fire on L
[2:17:17] CaptLaw44: but u should ask him the long way or fast way
[2:17:18] dreez9: k*
[2:17:23] staynsalty: better RP for lawyers
[2:17:25] shoootamcgavin: The scenario was going to be gold if all this never happened. Good thing the PD will never find out what the motive behind the kidnapping was
[2:17:26] RexPappa: CHIEFIFE
[2:17:28] dj_rendon: have something to dangle with the carrot
[2:17:31] Cthyllah: even if beric was wrong about something, his voice makes him correct.

[2:17:32] Lakers1nation: @h00tywh0 k thanks
[2:17:33] Eeyley: their cams are finally right next to each other peepoShy all they need do is lean over and peepoShy . o 0 ( meandyou )
[2:17:33] birdmanuno: Beric is perfect for chief
[2:17:35] imDudekid: @esfandtv I appreciate that you’re always trying to get the full story and make sure the charges are fair unlike my charges of 20 days (as Justin Kidd)
[2:17:36] mukiwa18: why is Ramee not here?
[2:17:38] deftcg: uhhh
[2:17:43] siilkyt: why is there "letter of the law" then lol
[2:17:44] KaycasTV: BASED beric
[2:17:44] GodSpeed_R: @alexlipson bans are made for ooc rp reasons. Not in-game punishment
[2:17:46] magnus139: Arckon was the perfect choice for chief
[2:17:47] meatlove69: boring RP
[2:17:47] permacool: @EsfandTV I SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE ASKING WHO IS WHO, MAYBE COOK UP AN OVERLAY OF STREAMER AND CHARACTER NAMES?
[2:17:50] EsfandTV: @imDudekid, PepeHands i'm glad you got out though
[2:17:52] MsAutumnWind: @mukiwa18 he never agreed to come on
[2:17:55] BolshevikPower: @permacool ^
[2:17:55] AdrianShoey: @EsfandTV This is the best way I think to describe it, Saab is trying to show the discount without first showing the MSRP price.
[2:17:56] Ashcheeksx: Stop saying Umbrella too lol
[2:17:56] IanDooleyTV: @imDudekid that 20-day thing was INSANE
[2:17:58] deftcg: @mukiwa18 conflict I think
[2:17:59] staynsalty: @mukiwa18 ate Wendy’s
[2:18:00] faroeislands_: GETALIFE LEAN OVER AND KISS SLACKS
[2:18:02] helltoraise: Prob is it was already screwed but tried to fix right there when was already screwed but should of just been finished than corrected after
[2:18:05] Sadisticmedic: @mukiwa18 Blame Blau he messed up
[2:18:07] rameesdoordash: to be fair, you chose to stack charges instead of RP the situations the gun was used in.  couldn't let K tell the stories because you would rather him sit in jail for 3 days vs 1
[2:18:09] savvvvy_: Video games got weird man
[2:18:12] DamnitAngel_: @faroeislands_ lmfaoo
[2:18:13] danbelow: It also confused the cops that were listening
[2:18:13] twilightbaseballscene: yep doing it in front of k wasn’t good
[2:18:14] theshoover: @imDudekid what did you do in those 20 days? other characters? RP in cells?
[2:18:16] deftcg: @mukiwa18 * Scheduling* conflict
[2:18:18] alexlipson: @GodSpeed_R You didnt get my point. Read it again
[2:18:19] taraannee: i like crim viewers being mad at pd over jail time as if pd creates the laws LUL
[2:18:19] Grallus: @imDudekid Yeah, you do
[2:18:23] frostyxdl: mr k was willing to talk but the more he talked the more charges he got lmao
[2:18:25] Wolowitza: Ssaab genuinely makes the most mistakes and nothing gets done about it
[2:18:30] mukiwa18: @deftcg lol. He's playing right now hahaha
[2:18:30] technochrist_: that’s literally what happened lol
[2:18:31] V3NCHEl2: @rameesdoordash ur not too bright are you
[2:18:38] Maz0hyst: @rameesdoordash You're literally not even listening to anything at all.
[2:18:42] PacGamer: @imDudekid PepeHands
[2:18:46] Eeyley: n- now kiss peepoShy
[2:18:52] rubberbreaker: Cornwood should not have been in the room or involved in creating charges when K asked for him to be removed due to conflict of interest
[2:18:53] wavy__________________: 5 hours to investigate
[2:18:54] Voeffrey: shouldn’t have been done in front of K
[2:18:55] Yosri_: @rameesdoordash shouldve put him in for 7 NODDERS
[2:18:56] afcheesy: then you shouldn’t be making deals in the discovery phase, no?
[2:18:56] Son_D_Goku: From Ks perspective it looked like the charges were set to be the 1400 months 50k fines and work down from there, then Cornwood was persisting to add the extra 1400  months +100k fine charge
[2:18:58] 0123four: Putting him in the interrogation room too fast was an issue, but we need to keep in mind Mr. K gave an ultimatum that the charges needed to be discussed in the room in real time - which lead to all the charges not being added at the start
[2:19:00] Switchblade142: K also did say he wouldn't be willing to talk unless they talked about it in front of him, caused confusion imo
[2:19:01] Exotic_Soul: @rameesdoordash you're so dense its insane
[2:19:02] Lucid_Jaydee: @Wolowitza thats not true, he actually might have the most daps in the Pd at the moment
[2:19:02] SouthPaw1724: GETALIFE BUY WHIPPY A HOUSE
[2:19:03] imDudekid: @esfandtv you have no idea how bad I wish I could ooc talk to Saab about this to see how they justify that
[2:19:06] ShaneyRL: ShaneyRL gifted a Tier 1 sub to imDudekid! They have given 22 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[2:19:06] GodSpeed_R: @alexlipson I do get the point. I've rp'd before on different servers.
[2:19:07] princess_cha0s86: just slow down
[2:19:07] EdibleBoxers: Boolets Looking
[2:19:08] FLCK3R: SLACKSSSSS Pog
[2:19:08] RiasGremoryLoveHer: shoudn't logic and common sence take place when doing pocession?
[2:19:08] Banana_Pizza_Enjoyer: if i were a cop i would stack charges, just so i can rp charges down and give the lawyer some Ws or create the illusion the crim get a juicy guilty plea
[2:19:10] Endor: GIVE EM THE MENU
[2:19:10] soltangris420: His voice so does not match his face.  lol.
[2:19:11] IanDooleyTV: im still sad cletus and leo didnt kiss last night

[2:19:17] MumblezWithaZ: holly chill ppl
[2:19:17] AndHaka54: yea since cornwood came in half way thru and charges kept going up and down confused mr.k which made him just say fuck it
[2:19:18] SystemCollapsed: K got everything he deserved.
[2:19:18] tehshoe: xdd
[2:19:18] Zendorea: You guys need a Charging officer in the Cells @EsfandTV
[2:19:19] megasoy: robbing a cop and touching a pd gun = 66 times of shooting a judge. LUL
[2:19:24] neowizerd: The issue is getting so butthurt about it OOC about doing somthing one way. Just let it play out it's RP not need to be so frustrated about it
[2:19:24] Kaskaen: I think one of the things they should do, is not deliberate charges in front of the crim
[2:19:25] tak0g0dz: @imdudekid See if you can get a lawyer and call for a Cruel and Unusual Punishment charge against the PD LUL

[2:21:35] Neiara__: I feel like across the board charges cost too little $$ (obviously some exceptions) but WAYYY too much TIME, until jail rp is more fleshed out and immersive
[2:21:36] HebrewOutlaw: @nhqnhq not true, Koil said crims should only be in jail a max of a few hours
[2:21:37] UPRIGHT77: I think cops needed to just go into questioning on the separate incidents on the gun. let’s criminal know that you’re going to be charging him for that but opening up for rp on his end to talk about that incident. then at end went over all his charges so you had time to work up most recent incident.

[2:25:37] god__turkey: @Rixxey I think there needs to be a cap on punishment time. 6 hours seems reasonable to me. Sitting in prison for 6 hours SUCKS. 2 days is excessive

[2:25:49] SpartanRanger01: true
[2:25:50] Neiara__: I just wish prison was more fleshed out, and more of an rp opportunity, before they tack on 3 days on charges
[2:25:51] DazedGeniee: @blindlite yea the cops assumed they were planted because of the context they had. It was obvious after cg's actions before that
[2:25:56] M33ZY11: good point
[2:25:59] kCblol: he's not at all wrong
[2:26:01] ZachFromChat: That is the point of being a cop, listen to a criminal convict himself
[2:26:04] burlin_: 3 days in jail meanwhile there was a guy in there for 7 times as long...

[2:26:12] BlindLITE: @DazedGeniee guess you weren't around for the whole thing that's ok
[2:26:14] Clodhoppr: still a great point, forhim, 3 hours waiting to lead to nothing but doubling his time
[2:26:14] TheBull14597: ssab with the mizkif laugh there
[2:26:15] enfranchise_: Well the cop RP is kind of to go harder on people fucking around no?
[2:26:15] Sowiloo: then cops don't want to be treated as NPC
[2:26:16] AndHaka54: he not wrong but in the case yesterday he was wrong
[2:26:19] mcfaceex: he said the Cops get annoyed by dragging it out and punish you for doing it

[2:26:20] ユージーン: that doesn't make any sense, so you don't give cops rp to get to jail and get out quick, how is that fun
[2:26:21] reagadin: who is the snake? ruth? sorry i had to make the joke, i have no issue with cheeva
[2:26:22] kingkoolkattz: u can't beat Siz Fulker at being a Karen, man does it best, got that speech 100
[2:26:25] Azane110: Mr.K.. after all those years of doing RP still cries whenever he loses a situation. Its been like that for years. Details dosnt matter to him unless he brings it up
[2:26:26] wavy__________________: the longer he sat, the more time was added from his pov
[2:26:27] SPxTDG: considering the case though and the evidence it makes sense
[2:26:29] dapyman: But crim RP in interrogation should be able to go either positive or negative ways

[2:26:39] dr_halsey_: while i agree if you snitch on yourself whats the cop supposed to do
[2:26:40] kCblol: @burlin_ and sheisty was off work for a month... none of which makes any of these situations less bs

[2:27:10] Lord__Gen: never talk to the cops irl. They don't need to know anything
[2:27:12] DazedGeniee: Would you guys rather crims get days in prison for robbing cops or just banned? The high prison time is an OOC decision . Literally do any crime except robbing/kidnapping cops. Is that so hard?
[2:27:13] inksday: @kCblol, When Den was fired was he sent to an RP blackhole though? The prison doesnt even have functioning mechanics

[2:27:31] geo_logic_: even when youre not in trouble you should still get a lawyer lol
[2:27:32] CastleWest: A judge has told me the same thing that I knew and was friends with that's funny
[2:27:33] jenny12gauge: It's their job to convict you and they'll do whatever they can to do it
[2:27:33] blimpguy: K isn't crying about getting time, he knew he was getting time 100% it was a way the plea was presented and then reneged and presented again

[2:27:56] megasoy: @Agony099 that's not the point. the time for kidnapping a cop + pd gun = 66 charges of shooting a judge. it's stupid
[2:28:01] frailgolem: What should be brought on the podcast! When a scuff happens to a criminal, consequences are way bigger, compared to a cop @esfandtv

[2:28:10] god__turkey: @ManakinEU Yeah dude you're literally the problem they are talking about. So out of touch. Murder is less of a punishment then robbing a cop
[2:28:11] koolcoach: That's used to be part of Cornwood's playbook
[2:28:15] brandonpotter123: @DazedGeniee this issue is kidnapping is 300min while there are 2 charges related to robbing a cop, robbing and possesion
[2:28:17] HebrewOutlaw: @blimpguy I wanted the RP to play out where he told them the story cause that would’ve been so good
[2:28:18] SlimTDC: why is Mr K always a kingpin lol

While it's not "healthy" for the server content, its necessary to prevent PvP skirmishes. You need to integrate certain punishment to develop CAUTION from crims. X ropped PD guns 24/7 till they raised the charge from 30k to 100k.

I don't like soft bans either, but finding the soft spot for "punishment is bad enough to not force it" and "punishment is just bad for content and server" is really hard to do. But I see you get my point which is good. It's just generally hard to balance imo

[2:36:38] Maz0hyst: @EsfandTV I said this last night but I think the big takeaway from it all was to do the charge discussion outside in the hall. Then present the charges, talk it down to lessers, etc. Then if a mistake happens take care of it after the fact and use it as a teaching experience. I feel doing it part way through stretched out things to long and made things heated. NODDERS

[2:40:52] ItsYojimbo: @mcfaceex should really talk about that second part yet. he doesn tknow that in character. and maybe not even out of character yet
[2:40:53] VH_KRIEG: it was only way to get guns then

[2:41:10] happysquidy69: y'all are just looking at ur little tablet and acting accordingly with charges (and being good faith lenient). prison terms arent your fault

[2:41:22] mcfaceex: @holycristmas its the SPIRIT of the law. The charge was added to stop lootboxing. K wasn't lootboxing so it sucks to apply it to an actual GOOD RP situation
[2:41:24] MaNSoN6649: Cant do the time dont do the crime

[2:42:34] Bubbles520: The 9s of 3.0 was astronomical compared to a day in 4.0
[2:42:36] Aphotice: its a risk vs reward balance, but in that situation there wasnt really a reward beyond the rp aspect
[2:42:36] twilightbaseballscene: yep
[2:42:38] imDudekid: @shum7 Yes. I was locked up for 20 days. make it make sense
[2:42:39] sirnigelthornberry: 1 day too short, 3 days too long. 2 days.
[2:42:42] SiemonSaid: didn't K assasinate a council member with his gun, severe seems pretty normal , no?

[2:42:48] permacool: @mcfaceex if the only way he can make a cool event is by stealing a downed cop ive got horrible news for you
[2:42:49] papavicks: Cornwood did that!
[2:42:50] alexlipson: Capping prison time, I agree
[2:42:50] Nadeflow: tbf the council rp denied K with his telemarketing and landlord buisness

[2:42:58] seronhp: Kevin said something when he was getting charged and it really hit. He said why make sentencing long. The RP is about catching them. Fine em and move on. Max time in should be 6 hours.

[2:43:04] MountainMAN1990: I'm 90% that 100k gun fine was added in when 9nky like 4-5 guns were stolen. Not even when the 6 guns in a row were... could be wrong but I swear remember that
[2:43:04] xMelissaXo: you can only do so much prison rp
[2:43:04] 1manpizza: It's in game balance vs rp balance. It's never gonna match up
[2:43:07] KNGRSM: so it comes down to good faith
[2:43:08] mcfaceex: @permacool it was literally an event for Tessa (an admin) in the making for over a week. You are ignorant
[2:43:08] Dontthinkson: Woah hes in prison? The place he wanted to be "hired" at, where they put in a semi DoC to give Prison RP, and people are gonna pretend theres nothing to do
[2:43:08] kurt404e: not much to do in prison atm
[2:43:08] alexlipson: Capping prison time except for terrorism is a good idea

[2:43:17] pennythug: @permacool exactly k shouldn't be doing any rp he should just be grinding Groupe 6 all day great take bro
[2:43:17] Duesbout: I mean shooting a judge and a council member and kidnapping a cop sounds an awful lot like terrorism
[2:43:18] Oatmealyeti_: i miss bovice
[2:43:18] HeyMeghan: the problem is that the cops don’t set the time or fines
[2:43:19] TammoNL: but how long? he could do 30 min and log off
[2:43:19] detergent86: Kevin needs to except his time is no more special than anyone else’s ffs
[2:43:20] callmefive: that’s literally what he did
[2:43:22] Blaze_sontagami: @evilmnkey4 My brain was on auto lmao, yeah it was stupid putting Justin in there for 21 days
[2:43:23] suqmah: @imDudekid this mentality is what makes this shit go in circles. y u comparing 2 bad things when they both should be fixed?

[2:43:28] fishiegoblublub: its just an unfortunate situation as per the rules
[2:43:28] BlueEnvyNation: understandable why it was created, but when you know there is RP behind things, not just shitlording, I think PD should be able to have the freedom to modify time based on situation

[3:10:01] BlindLITE: @TheyCallMeGeg nah he's gotta do something to entertain 20k people with 2 days in prison todays bout to hilarious
[3:10:05] alexlipson: G6 PD escorts are cringe though. It's a bandaid fix and not the core problem fix. Make it harder for G6 to get robbed instead of escorting G6
[3:10:08] EsfandTV: @lookachef, 37C calls you have to jump the route it's different
[3:10:11] ManakinEU: if all the civs turn into crims all you gonna have left is PINGS and gang wars LUL

[3:11:51] EsfandTV: @Dontthinkson, there's no way to actually sign out and the other cops would have seen my tracker anyway. tbh the signout might have not even mattered because cops were already on the way because cornwood got kidnapped in front of 3 other government employees with 2 other cops on the way
[3:11:53] halos420: @gundaree kebun stated he isn't interested because it leads to nothing but out of context clips for people to shit on him about.

[3:12:17] FilzG: @Dontthinkson because a building is fucking closed and not operational so its a scuff in his mind that it isnt operational?

[3:12:32] itsay3t1: Saab still sounds like a cop in real life
[3:12:32] permacool: I think Kebun made a bad decision not coming on. Communication is important, and this will certainly skew public opinion of him. Not a good look when you beg for changes and then do not show up to the discourse. Very sad.
[3:12:32] mcfaceex: @EsfandTV already on the way and knowing Cornwoods exact location are different though, tbf

[3:12:40] Dontthinkson: @EsfandTV oh i agree, was bein sarcastic.
[3:12:40] StreamElements: Post top tier content to my subreddit https://reddit.com/r/esfandtv
[3:12:42] halos420: 3 days for kidnapping a cop is a literal joke. Don't care if anyone thinks otherwise.
[3:12:43] pfcyami: Cornwood needs that last Ssaab take
[3:12:48] Themessias1001: Wrangle was putting fear in people

[3:12:54] luxxen1: Yea what is the worst that can happen if a Cop fails to follow procedure and goes with the RP? Like the get fired for a Sam Baas Salute? Never surely LUL
[3:12:55] Zinzio: @EsfandTV sucks cause it denied what seemed like would have been a great RP story
[3:12:57] Chaoszero_goc: Even if he could have signed out the cops had already found him. They were right there
[3:13:00] mfam_lp: could have solved all those murders on the gun if cut a break and give no prison time
[3:13:01] Yosri_: @halos420 it was way more than just one kidnapping tho
[3:13:02] Tcmasterzzz: RIPBOZO
[3:13:04] dapyman: @permacool agreed, very juvenile
[3:13:05] Gundaree: @halos420 I thought 3 days for all 7 charges? or does that not suit the narrative?
[3:13:07] permacool: To each their own, but I think much productive discourse could have come from Kebun being open to this conversation Sadge
[3:13:08] Connorbrow: Yeah, the speed of the response they'd've probably seen him leaving paleto with or without the sign out
[3:13:09] TheNotoriousKEV: guys, mr k had a weapon on him that was linked to 5 MAJOR cases, it wasnt JUST that he kidnapped and robbed the cop
[3:13:14] zac4e: FeelsGoodMan
[3:13:14] SavageTarzan: Buhh
[3:13:15] side_ofbeef: can't go into a fight thinking you wont get hit
[3:13:16] Skylo97: @mcfaceex they were on the way to paleto PD before cornwood got there because they figured they would try to get the tracker off him. so it didnt matter much at all
[3:13:17] halos420: @yosri_ it was 2 days alone for the kidnapping.
[3:13:18] FilzG: @BlindLITE its like any other building that serves no purpose but are opened, they're all over the place in LS
[3:13:18] permacool: @dapyman Understandably so, still Sadge

[3:13:50] happysquidy69: esfand :D rn is so funny
[3:13:52] mcfaceex: @Skylo97 but that's a problem on it's own. it's dumb that there isn't an /offduty command like there used to be.
[3:13:53] BedlessSleeper: You really should get the mods to create a ban list to get viewers to get banned in all NoPixel streamers chats.
[3:13:53] EdibleBoxers: @ColbaeTV only cause its kinky
[3:13:56] Yosri_: @halos420 not 3, dont be dishonest then
[3:13:56] EsfandTV: @tbowfoshow, I like them seeing other people seeing how stupid they are :)

[3:14:03] SavageTarzan: :)
[3:14:04] Tokki_Foolz: Blau*
[3:14:04] TheDillestOfWeeds: RP shows the parasociality of streamers and there community to the extremes
[3:14:10] afcheesy: it looks open by all practical means. there is no building there in regular GTA, being able to go in that building is a No Pixel thing, plus the book is there to sign out, it just doesn’t work. Theres no way for K to know because it looks like it should work. I think that’s why he says scuff.
[3:14:10] BedlessSleeper: This shit is crazy with how many chatters are just being toxic or blatantly malicious
[3:14:13] FilzG: @BlindLITE cause theres a whole RP first that still needs to play out for that building to become operational, hello?
[3:14:13] permacool: @Lupusdeus Yeah totally fair, just wish he came on Sadge
[3:14:13] ActuallySupremacy: @Slacks GETALIFE PRINT SOMETHING!

[3:14:26] DanLGG: Oh that was 4head and GG
[3:14:27] BUTHEDD_: its nice that people are invested but they dont have to pick a faction between cops or crims
[3:14:29] jvela2123: damn
[3:14:30] TheNotoriousKEV: @halos420 but the other half of the time came from the other shit
[3:14:32] TheDillestOfWeeds: people just gotta chill lol
[3:14:32] theblackdog808: That was impressive
[3:14:32] BedlessSleeper: they should not be allowed to say stuff in other streamers chats and be perfectly fine in 'their' streamers chats.
[3:14:33] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: sounds like gta 5 Trevor shit

[3:14:53] halos420: @thenotoriouskev yeah a gun that he touched only because mechanically he had to because there is no other way to safely kidnap a cop

[3:15:04] Gigadinker: I understand the whole Meta thing, but you guys are creating this podcast talking Meta. What’s the difference with this, and reaching out to K to explain?
[3:15:04] KCgocrazy: one extra bullet for person who wanted to one life- but get murder and almost lose job . cops need more room to rp
[3:15:06] xTopCop: @Pheyond lol you good?
[3:15:08] watermelontoboggan: Wrangler changing out dundee escape vehicle in 3.0 was so good
[3:15:12] Swabbers: @EsfandTV I think Crims should be able to bribe/pay themselfs out of most of the trouble, its good for both RP and Economy, The big fish are the once having the most money Etc

[3:41:34] uniacid: @roguemax2512 shot him in the back while swimming in the rivier LUL great RP
[3:41:34] Z3phs: yeah blau is reasonable... like xqC once got pulled out between 6 cops cars while handcuffed like how???
[3:41:37] CanuckDynasty: the 7 bike swaps is the only thing that’s cring for me as a viewer

[3:41:53] BedlessSleeper: funny as fuck
[3:41:55] DakkonRz: @Dontthinkson exactly. this way the mechanic doesnt need to be balanced. depending on which cop is cuffing it will be harder or easier. i think its an easy fix, wish they would see this ><
[3:41:56] Fozenoh: BatChest MR K
[3:41:56] Kiester_Felterbutts: lol

[3:43:43] KaycasTV: kekw
[3:43:43] DakkonRz: thoughts on this idea @EsfandTV ?i think adding a mechanic for cops when cuffing would be nice. like sort of a VS minigame. where you both need to do the same thing, sort of lilke the old arm wrestling machanic. that way mechanically gifted cops could be more skilled at cuffing
[3:43:44] enser27: Maple LUL LUL

[3:43:49] 4150706925: @D_The_Dream grats!
[3:43:49] Dontthinkson: @JustJoshinYa2 100% dude is top tier. and its not like it happened to a "nobody". Dudes very good, and popular. People will be in jail for him to interact with. Not like Whippy saying there was nothing in 3.0. They put in Bobby and Carmine to give these guys something to do.
[3:43:50] ColbaeTV: @Fozenoh if ur on ios try frosty app it has emotes
[3:43:50] KaycasTV: @Fozenoh CAUGHT
[3:43:53] dapyman: Tazer scuffs also impact things
[3:43:56] ManakinEU: @xGameShock if you constantly do crazy shit then you should be expecting to get caught eventually tho no?
[3:43:58] tigolbytties01: ember quinn beat down 2 cops yesterday lol
[3:44:05] Fozenoh: @colbaetv ooooo imma chekc that now been using chatsen ever since
[3:44:05] Lord__Gen: Is planning a prison break, while crims know Arckon and Ssaab will be in this podcast, considered power gaming?
[3:44:11] Sadisticmedic: Tazer and Gun Scuff

[3:44:25] ADub187: @manakineu it's not about getting caught. Is the system behind getting caught that sucks :)
[3:44:26] Chaoszero_goc: So we shouldnt hold 3 cops hostage over a evading warrent?
[3:44:34] CrystalDimension: YEP people > locals
[3:44:35] chmod_R_777: Nerdge SOP have no nuance, DAP
[3:44:37] KaycasTV: @pinkwolfxd does that work on iOS?
[3:44:38] racoon21: who are the 3 people w/o cam?
[3:44:40] ColbaeTV: @Fozenoh yeah try it, its good
[3:44:41] xGameShock: @ManakinEU Yes, But that means your not allowed to try hard to get away too? Cops need crims to have content as much as cop viewers say "dont do crime if u dont wonna get caught"
[3:44:43] Doqx42: consistency on the warnings, if it's always random 5-100 warnings then they just keep coming back for the next warning
[3:44:44] Z3phs: exactly you cant go around knifing civilians and then expect 5 cuffs...
[3:44:45] SpiritEX: Duncaning I had 2 more poits
[3:44:49] Stank_Dankly: @Lord__Gen Who is planning a prison break?
[3:44:51] OtsoLupo: @Lord__Gen, Prison breaks don't exist, you get teleported back to the ceel if you leave the prison
[3:44:53] Dontthinkson: @Chaoszero_goc wait, every time youre pulled over for speeding it shouldnt end up in a 15 minute chase?
[3:44:55] pinkwolfxd: @KaycasTV yea no sorry :(
[3:44:56] HebrewOutlaw: @lord__gen you can’t break out of prison
[3:44:57] Maz0hyst: @Dontthinkson What @Dontthinkson said. Couple of people were planning on giving him more rp today too since he's in there.

[3:45:53] KaycasTV: GETALIFE SHOOT TO KILL
[3:45:53] Yosri_: @xGameShock the problem with that is, cops specifically hold back to not powergame, they could just powertackle into taze and catch everyone. its frustrating to see crims trying to powergame out of every situation
[3:45:55] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: they should of been shot asap
[3:45:56] CrystalDimension: @Lord__Gen if anything it could've been considered meta-gaming or just fail rp. Hard to say

[3:48:53] medvedek07: PrideLaugh

[4:00:10] CrystalDimension: or 4th
[4:00:15] Elmond: just reduce it to rule of 4 again
[4:00:16] VincentsDeath: swaps are needed due to a cop breaking off and repairing and getting gas
[4:00:18] Gachiguru: @Datursa you have to have a lot of cops because if they split then you need 6 cars on the chase
[4:00:21] IamLevels: Rule of 6 was the real problem, should have stayed as max 4 ppl
[4:00:26] Austin7x3: swapping to parked vehicles is fine, its when 10 people drive in and pick people up
[4:00:29] fishmeatx: just give cops shitty helis

[4:02:51] Gulkai: "I won't reveal why" proceeds to reveal why kekw
[4:02:56] dejavu853: maybe make a tracker beacon that the cops will only use if there is a swap and it puts a transponder on the swap vehicle for like 5 min.
[4:02:56] SwitchBord001: I saw a recent chase irl where Air 1 footage had an overlay with map showing street names. It looked like a game...

[4:04:04] den0vo: its cause air 1 is miles above the ground

[4:32:42] DeoNone: FirstTimeChatter  :)
[4:32:43] Nomad_Ninja: @stellarnaut just as in the real world, they'd have to get permissions, and present the case to their CO (captains). If the captain gives the go-ahead, then the detective leads the way with beat cops in tow
[4:32:43] Caerys_: :)
[4:32:45] DaZooKidd420: Cops should have their own way to go about charges and things just because cornwood was a lawyer for a few days shouldn't mean every RP cop should do things by the book

[4:34:22] Fozenoh: GIGACHAD CoP
[4:34:24] zuze: @EsfandTV Officers always PRESENTING all of the charges and then very being clear about only PRESSING certain ones will help with lying too. Makes it clear what is officer discretion. I think this is what you've been pushing for?
[4:34:25] MDM4ever1986HD: hey esfand

[4:34:56] stellarnaut: @nomad_ninja I don't know why you're mentioning the real world. In the real world I can match foot prints to shoes. I can find receipts of people buying tools to hide a body. I can check for blood on a knife. Nopixel has none of that. PD can literally watch a crim remove a AC unit and if he doesn't find the unit on him he basically can't charge the crim LUL
[4:34:56] Serakkis: @SIeeptic nope, all natural LUL
[4:34:57] biscuitz1776: I watch mostly cop streams, this has certainly given me a different view of the Crim side good stuff Thank you Guys.

[4:34:58] ManakinEU: @EsfandTV imo maybe getting a lawyer for both sides when pushing charges to mediate between both sides as a neutral party could be interesting maybe ?

[8:03:39] EmDuBB13: ofc juicer is on crain and lenny kekw
[8:03:40] WeekendCQ: but if youre 10-8, youre out of service and dispatch requests would not go through to you. Dispatch *would* just ask for a radio check from those units who *may* be back in service but have not came out about it for a radio check. I did dispatch for a few years at a local SO and that was out procedure
[8:03:41] SurelyBaked: I think it’s because saying “back” doesn’t matter, what matters is whether or not you’re in service. you’re out of service before saying it so saying “10-8” implies you’re back in service anyway. their speech is to cut out as much needless words as possible for clear coms

[8:10:03] imSteffin: @bencodesall, This is a modified version of GTAV that runs on a server that you need access to which means you need to be whitelisted.

[8:10:31] i_am_jam_: @bencodesall white listed is the server for nopixel, not anyone can play gotta apply, more checks than public servers as its full of streamers
[8:10:33] Stuart_Lethal: @bencodesall GTA RP, specifically the one you are watching right now, is run through a NoPixel server. There are free servers to join through those. But if you wanted to join one with such as the one esfand is playing on right now you'd have to pay the server owners.

[9:31:22] WyattKB: @SumDee_LumDee I think it was a fair frustration with all of the planning he put in to it. But again shit happens, the prison arc today has been top notch. To many people want scripted gameplay

[13:04:21] GlitchyGunZ: true @esfandtv
[13:04:23] bluej255: skill issue
[13:04:23] Neekapkilla: no because of all your side missions and people coming up to you to talk
[13:04:24] taraannee: alot of pd doesnt play just to work tho so they have expenses from off duty shit
[13:04:24] stellarnaut: they "should" yes
[13:04:25] Toastbane: you have personal car though
[13:04:26] Bill_Collector: Depends on how shit you are at driving
[13:04:27] Toastedgamer03: yeah instead of 1 shift expenses you have 2 shift expenses right?
[13:04:32] atrigent: maybe?
[13:04:33] RGB13: FART ON LENNY RIGHT NOW moon2A
[13:04:33] mercs99: also, cornwood likes to slam into things at high speeds
[13:04:34] sauslol: He doesnt understand what you are saying
[13:04:34] miller511: how many repairs you doin a day?
[13:04:35] AsuniRS: if you have to cover the repair for the person before you, you have to do 2 repairs in the time you have 1 repair with your personal
[13:04:36] Lee__Ham: Yeah. And you crash a lot, so you're always paying for repairs kekw
[13:04:36] callmefive: jo
[13:04:36] Synetics: Isn't that exactly how it would work?
[13:04:37] SavageTarzan: xdd spent 220k on turbos

[13:04:37] colonelmakepeace: LUL
[13:04:39] fredhw: depends how many IFAK you use
[13:04:40] Jimmy_Tha_Quad: depends on how many chases you're in.
[13:04:40] Chris08533: if ur only on for an hr and have to repair every time nah
[13:04:40] callmefive: no
[13:04:40] BUTHEDD_: No Tomfoolery
[13:04:42] MrPRINCE______: you could be processing or report taking for way longer
[13:04:42] PoisonDart11: you dont repair every 4 hours
[13:04:42] NonToxicant: xdd
[13:04:43] JLanggz: and you crash more than anyone else
[13:04:44] SeaThePirateCat: you do have your own car too
[13:04:45] jadetortoise: Also consider if you ride with a partner, you split the repair costs while both of you get paid
[13:04:45] TheNachoManRandyCabbage: you do a lot of standing around talkin\
[13:04:47] mclovins1g: No cause you crash more often
[13:04:48] loudoun: @nick_cola86 yeah I guess forcing interaction with the mechanics is good; maybe a joint PD account that gets charged, then
[13:04:48] GYNECHIATRIST: UBI when cmonnn
[13:04:48] callmefive: you talk more
[13:04:49] bandanasandwich: there are usually a couple hours of Duncaning tbf
[13:04:49] Marc720: Not if you have to repair other ppl cars when you get in.
[13:04:50] JasonMunday: WAGING
[13:04:50] phaden_: GETALIFE CROP DUST FLOP
[13:04:51] BakedBeandon: pd vibes are vibing and morale is moraling FeelsGoodMan
[13:04:52] ChaoticSanity: yeah, its not like you have to factor in travel time or transportation lmao
[13:04:52] georg94: cornwood crashes more as well
[13:04:53] Toastedgamer03: well actually it depends on how many car chases you get into
[13:04:55] PrettyKrazy: ?????
[13:04:55] Exorius: @taraannee like what? you can buy a car and a house and thats it. everything else will get you kicked out of the PD
[13:04:56] tttony2x: its still an hourly wage
[13:04:57] senmk3: you pretty much walk around mrpd alooot
[13:04:57] GlitchyGunZ: I guess it depends on if they crash or how safe, they are @esfandtv right
[13:04:58] nick_cola86: @loudoun yeah, that would make sense
[13:04:59] w111iam1: You do a lot of yapping tho
[13:04:59] Vertigo_GG: If everyone else repairs twice, and you're on duty twice as long as everyone else, you're repairing ~4 times. It scales
[13:05:06] dreggy69: Andrew Yang tried to fix this...
[13:05:06] gmanx86: fold him
[13:05:08] DaymanF0TNM: yea, I feel like the people compaining were greatly exaggerating their cost.  They both managed to make enough money to pay on a house
[13:05:10] gone_off_scripts: wait wut
[13:05:10] Hilink24: the issue isnt that they arent gettting paid enough its that they are repairing other peoples fuck ups
[13:05:13] humanhere2: Maybe, but you earn MORE quickly... like if you are taking home $400/hr... you do 16hrs a day, so you take home twice as much within a given amount of time....
[13:05:13] MrGriffdude: if you eat the cost of 4 hours but work 12 per day you earn more
[13:05:13] jdotno: you spend the second half of your shift talking
[13:05:15] heinousanus95: He misunderstood i think
[13:05:18] 6all: @esfandtv you are correct. the cops having money issues also have intelligence issues and its not a coincidence

[13:05:54] nick_cola86: is turner gone again?
[13:05:56] SupportCarryy: PepoG each Cop should just have a expense report, so you know who is paying for repairs, and if they need a raise
[13:05:57] Xen_Crypt: I'm going to assume the motor pool hurts cars
[13:05:58] Neekapkilla: They need more ways to gather materials other than Sanitation
[13:05:58] Bill_Collector: What you're saying makes no sense tbh. car damage and daily mileage is variable.

[13:07:02] HenryChase: "flop needs to do more policing" hops in cornwoods car to not do policing PepeLaugh
[13:07:05] callmefive: ride with people and don’t pay for repairs
[13:07:06] ChaoticSanity: repairs are all based off of mileage from what we've heard recently so everyones repairs are going to vary based on how much they drive @EsfandTV
[13:07:07] DaelinT: @M__Wolfe Prolly a good idea
[13:07:12] PWRslide2: dude asks why have a gun?  come on.  fired
[13:07:14] MrGriffdude: but the cost of a car repair is the same?
[13:07:15] Riqui__: idk if the car repairs scale linearly
[13:07:15] Wetidiot: The main complaint seemed to be people just putting cars back that need repairs and putting the cost onto someone else, and then that same person repairs the car when they go off duty
[13:07:15] atrigent: chat is now in fast mode

[13:07:25] slumgator96: You are not driving at the same rate tho
[13:07:25] ArcaniWolfTv: cornhole violating several traffic lights, and driving against the flow of traffic

[13:07:26] BakedBeandon: @m__wolfe I agree
[13:07:26] ronjeremy42069: wow shitting on the pd stackers
[13:07:31] Bill_Collector: @esfandtv You could be in chases for 5 hours if you're shift 2, or never if you're shift 3. It's variable.
[13:07:32] w111iam1: It depends tho
[13:07:38] Nymsoft: @taraannee Everyone wants Turner here though, and it's ooc issues
[13:07:41] ltl_wackman: monkaW
[13:07:41] willietrom: if there's an extra repair at the end of shift, then having more shift ends per hour costs more

[13:08:01] EPiQ: A short shifter does a higher percentage of it as patrol. Longer shift PD usually  generally spend a higher percentage doing meetings and stuff
[13:08:02] taraannee: @Exorius they have pd cars u cant use off duty. bc others rp off-duty, some have bought reg cars. also houses are hundreds of thousands of $
