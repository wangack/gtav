[4:00:53] jaggedbowl420: don‚Äôt give a fuck
[4:00:54] AreolaGorgonzola: Chat can you put the stills in a house?
[4:00:55] MamaPr1m3: family over greed
[4:00:59] HebrewOutlaw: @jokerssmile same
[4:01:00] snowdrako: Gomer was the one who brought up robbing moonshine people which lead to this lol
[4:01:02] galaxynova24x: The real issue here is Vinny house we can all agree
[4:01:03] Ramgoth: 100% mcgreagor
[4:01:03] UrClassicDerp: isn‚Äôt this part of the gang life?
[4:01:03] snowdrako: ü§£ü§£
[4:01:04] darkkingrayley: why don't you just put your stills in the back yard of cg? who is gonna touch those?  even the cops will think twice
[4:01:05] PhazeOne_G: I guess they shouldn‚Äôt have trusted the sewers and the people
[4:01:05] anthonytanza001: Is Mr. K supposed to wake up today ? I am definitely curious to know what he will think of what has happened
[4:01:09] dkk2099: Tuggs will murder everyone lol
[4:01:13] GamerFixOfficial: I actually think K would give a fuck because he fucks with gomer, taco. so if someone is attacking them he might pressure them
[4:01:14] krustymcdoogle: @shotz put sanctions on the sewers and ray king lol
[4:01:17] Greg0201: what if its rat king and he is just acting like he dont know lol

[4:01:24] JokersSmile: @hebrewoutlaw genuinely embarrassing from some chatters
[4:01:29] ellystacklebox: CG doesn't have the weaponry to protect themselves right now. Need to be more careful
[4:01:38] zaynnyy444: just gotta start applying pressure to every possible suspect
[4:01:39] Ichigolo: time to find a new place
[4:01:39] RayyBeukers: how they know where the still were tho
[4:01:39] MissN23: does reed know exactly which distillery‚Äôs are CG?
[4:01:40] Antelic: but why do they build the stills in the sewers when its so populated? its bound to have conflict like this. and brewing moonshine "origionally" is outdoors in the "jungle" :p
[4:01:40] Ramgoth: Could be Harry too?!?
[4:01:40] GrayNW: I think it's the ratkig group
[4:01:46] IamHondoLane: @gamerfixofficial 100% he said as much

[4:02:12] faults_x: just destroy all the stills KEKW
[4:02:13] clapped360: @ellystacklebox cg has plenty of guns

[4:02:38] GamerFixOfficial: yeah if gomer tells K someone robbed him of 40k its going to end badly for them
[4:02:40] Greg0201: yea i think CG will destory every still and just robb even more inless someone comes clean about it
[4:02:49] natchochat: Chat just watch and enjoy the rp

[4:03:29] inkninja718: true
[4:03:29] mcdermott41: I think the stills should be out in the country anyway personally
[4:03:31] jaggedbowl420: do it, and shoot anyone that moves down here lol
[4:03:34] Xx_InSomNia_xX: u should. if u guys can't do it no one can
[4:03:36] Arnob_MN: @greg0201 if ramee know this he thug and peanut oooou

[4:03:40] notsoslimshady36: then every deffo gonna hate CG
[4:03:41] Antelic: ye doing public moonshine brewing is kinda risky if u think about it. someone could take pictures and shit and snitch
[4:03:42] YodieOdie: LUL
[4:03:47] R3dl1nes: tbh its rat kings area so it should be down to him to find out who did it
[4:03:47] Antelic: since there is a lot of snitches around :p
[4:03:49] DaviMury: show to not fuck with cg
[4:03:51] bugzz70: make everyone start from ground zero
[4:03:52] lightofgleipnir_: i hope mr.k does something about this i know hes busy with his own arc
[4:03:54] big_moose_gamer: Moonshine should be outside in forest so you should do that
[4:03:55] weyland_yutani_x: @Shotz is there a HOA in the sewers maybe stills were the wrong color ?
[4:04:05] bigren916: Let the sewers now that its going to be open season on moonshine then if nobody nows who it was. Eventually people will get tired and fold.
[4:04:06] Dorky1495: Chat... Mr K clearly dont give af if some pretend gangster civs gonna be mad at CG
[4:04:10] Bronzesicks: tell everyone if you dont get names everyones shit gets hit
[4:04:11] b_goodhue: The rat king wants to think it wasn't him
[4:04:12] Dorky1495: They can run garbage all they want

[4:05:18] UrClassicDerp: bring old Vinny back, fk everybody else kebunDance
[4:05:19] mjtorn: K will literally tell the Rat king this is supposed to be his turf, so he needs to find out who did it, or CG will kick them all out of sewers.
[4:05:19] Greg0201: at some point someone will say who did it just so their stuff dont get destoried
[4:05:23] capablecitizen: do it
[4:05:25] Dorky1495: RIP Stills in the sewer when K wakes up
