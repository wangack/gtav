[1:25:22] hecktobreakfast: BOOBA

[1:29:49] A_Humble_Wooper: Yep, everybody started from zero on the server. Regardless of if they were a totally new character or a carryover.

[1:30:31] WentToBuyMilkAgain: I have seen chatters getting banned on kick
[1:30:49] WentToBuyMilkAgain: Mostly really dumb guys though
[1:30:59] CozyTeaSipper: @Kthanid I think Nancy waking up would be a very rare and short thing, like if good friends would perma. And for that short period she could just pretend to be rich.
[1:31:06] kangg: yeah kick still be wildin lol
[1:31:08] doc_sharon: they seems shocked by it KEKW
[1:31:15] doc_sharon: BRUH

[1:31:22] Baaaaaats: As if a moderated space is such a foreign concept on the internet
[1:31:37] thatgirl_bryce: I love when people try to argue bans as if a rule break is the only reason they can get banned. Like nah fam, if the vibes are off I can just meet you idgaf
[1:31:49] thatgirl_bryce: Just yeet*
[1:32:04] doc_sharon: katesJam katesJam katesJam
[1:32:13] A_Humble_Wooper: ... streams don't have a max number of accounts we can ban per day. Ban evasion doesn't make things okay, it just gets you banned AND reported to the platform for ban evasion. katesSuffer
[1:32:16] doc_sharon: katesAw WAOW
[1:32:18] AshuraX13: katesAw Wade likes the club
[1:32:32] yaroslavp86: @thatgirl_bryce what is the other reasons people can be banned other than rule breaks?
[1:33:07] mister_nibbles: Streamers need no justification to ban someone from their stream
[1:33:24] hecktobreakfast: @yaroslavp86 Harassment, bullying, racism, sexism, stalking.... so many things.
[1:33:29] doc_sharon: Yoink
[1:33:34] yaroslavp86: Which is rule breaks
[1:33:39] doc_sharon: katesGiggles

[1:35:01] AshuraX13: katesNoted
[1:35:22] A_Humble_Wooper: @yaroslavp86 just being weird and creeping streamer or chat out can sometimes get people banned, too.

[1:35:48] doc_sharon: the club is on top of things!

[1:36:29] dusty_blade: I know of a streamer that bans anyone who gets gifted a tier 2 sub LUL
[1:36:32] AshuraX13: peepoSit
[1:36:57] A_Humble_Wooper: @yaroslavp86 to be clear I'm not saying YOU are doing anything ban-worthy, just mentioning it doesn't need to only be specific rule breaks. katesL
[1:37:03] minusxero: @dusty_blade That guy seems like a Noblet
[1:37:14] doc_sharon: katesPlot
[1:37:32] thatgirl_bryce: @yaroslavp86 since every stream can set their rules outside of TOS rule breaks, it can be for literally anything tbh. But there have been times anywhere from when people keep bringing up topics that aren't relevant to clearly trolling for reactions to just continuously bringing down chat. Obviously those all came with warnings etc first but at the end of the day if you think folks are acting in bad faith you can ban them

[7:40:54] doc_sharon: MaxxRoll Maxx does not do feelings
[7:41:15] lorddracnor: Maxx a hot ass sociopath
[7:41:24] A_Humble_Wooper: Maxx barely has friends.
[7:41:34] Insaif: She's ambivalent to the whole thing.
[7:41:47] its_me_andie: makes sense
[7:42:09] AshuraX13: I've noticed she never hugs, unlike V
[7:42:14] doc_sharon: ooooh true
[7:42:29] AlleyCat_LaneUK: how many furs was there?
[7:42:37] lorddracnor: I feel like there's alot to unpack there
[7:42:39] Kthanid: Even leaning her head on Tom's shoulder, she was drunk.
[7:42:46] witchmina: katesD WOW, spoilers Kate, thanks Kappa
[7:42:53] abblepiewit: I mean, "noticed" but only as a "she's not huggy-huggy like V".
[7:42:53] A_Humble_Wooper: Or, like, carrying their injured bodies to the hospital. But that's functional not emotional.
[7:42:54] AshuraX13: I been noticing. She is very closed off
[7:42:56] witchmina: katesGiggles
[7:43:03] doc_sharon: I brought up the hugging Tom when it happened and nobody bit KEKW
[7:43:12] laxwall11: I noticed just didn't need to call it out lol
[7:43:19] Insaif: Heck, she's only shown even a slight bit of interest in one person so far, and that was because the lady was basically walking around in her underwear.
[7:43:41] rickbuh: someone who got out of an abusive relationship by murdering them has trouble with feelings, what.... katesSmile

[7:47:40] Nightbot: Follow Kate on Instagram! instagram.com/kate.ttv
[7:47:48] rickbuh: just the fur should get Maxx out of negative at least
[7:47:50] Kthanid: You sell the local the fur and the meat, but the fur is used for furniture crafting.
[7:48:13] AshuraX13: Very guarded
[7:48:19] A_Humble_Wooper: It's also super meta until she tells people in character. Even pointing out the quirks or commenting that there could be issues, is SUPER meta.
[7:48:19] kangg: ah yeah the local buys meat that’s what I was thinking of
[7:48:20] abblepiewit: I mean, very understandably so given the past trauma.
[7:48:23] doc_sharon: Also, relationships have been super messy in the Raiders so far KEKW
[7:48:33] Kthanid: Yeah she seems like the type as now to keep things platonic or casual, so one doesn't get feelings.
[7:48:52] Kthanid: Okay fair.
[7:49:03] lorddracnor: I'm gonna be real, Raider vibes have been so good that I havn't even noticed that stuff.
[7:49:12] PacMan419: let the writers write
[7:49:28] Crafty_Crystal: does Maxx even notice that Tom likes her?
[7:49:29] AshuraX13: I try not to make assumptions, RP is too fluid to predict

[7:56:56] AshuraX13: katesGiggle
[7:57:19] Insaif: @A_Humble_Wooper It can be very good if prepared properly. Sometimes a bit gamey/musky, but usually good.
[7:57:25] Larkonus: @A_Humble_Wooper It's rather different than beef, but not dramatically so. I recommend it given the chance, but I wouldn't say it's essential.
[7:57:33] Nightbot: Follow Kate on Twitter! twitter.com/katestark
[7:57:54] KarnEvil: @A_Humble_Wooper when prepared properly it can be very tasty.  but certain cuts can be very tough and gamey.  its also a very lean meat, so it can dry out too much if you're not careful.
[7:58:08] Larkonus: My grandparents went hunting once and brought home 2 huge bucks. We ate venison burgers and jerky for weeks, it was great.
