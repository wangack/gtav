[6:04:49] Corvis_glyph: maybe for raia
[6:05:00] animeshuun: Couldn't we buy like 3 more dishwashers since we have a lot of dirty money?
[6:05:03] MayaisAqt: I feel like Jay is a contradiction in his own way with not caring about money but caring about it
[6:05:08] warnivea: BRO , i just saw what  happen with Kelly, you are going to laugh when you discover KEKW
[6:05:09] animeshuun: oh interesting
[6:05:22] echodrop: 0.36 in the wallet Pog
[6:05:23] Stewy21: I think the PC is missing wifi and that's maybe why it's not farming BUTCOIN
[6:05:24] Tarikws: Butcoin  was broken for a lot of players
[6:05:24] Lucsvm: is on the wallet
[6:05:26] lucine91: The coins broke earlier

[6:05:28] AshesToAsh3s: wallet
[6:05:31] nikulaz_: none, its banked
[6:05:34] lost_minotaur: in wallet

[6:05:46] nikulaz_: no they didn't
[6:05:59] Mackn9ne: they dont have vpn yet i thought
[6:06:06] lucine91: The mining broke for everyone earlier
[6:06:08] Stewy21: yeah the PC is still missing wifi
[6:06:14] nikulaz_: they got vpn yesterday

[6:07:50] RealWicari: @Lucsvm its just the desk that is cheap, u need hdd cpu and vpn as well
[6:08:07] Stewy21: I reckon they should use the PC's to farm more butcoin... but yes, it's expensive
[6:08:15] Juicyfruitgum: Gm Kris chat yeeLove
[6:08:20] Mackn9ne: also it adds to the electric bill if you ahve more then 1 pc
[6:08:25] Mars_nights: And then your gonna pull a garek

[6:15:21] htegamerking: dont u need a slushie from him?
[6:15:26] e1k4bong: You just dont wanna spoil ish. Its like a show or movie you are watching with friends

[6:16:39] DruminDriver: if Jay is EMS and there is a prison break you might be able to get let in
[6:16:42] Oatmealyeti_: free bovice!
[6:16:43] ZigSithExarKun: alowo get the heli
[6:16:52] DruminDriver: or a riot
[6:17:03] animeshuun: I was thinking just buy a drink while being in EMS and then go straight here?
[6:17:04] NashXXIII: will prison time be increased in the. future?
[6:17:05] RogueBear: if you can get in as EMS maybe you can walk in and fix your slushie? lol
[6:18:29] Dark_Prior88: Longer jail times seems fine if there is something to do
[6:18:45] Dark_Prior88: So far the ppl I've seen go to jail it's empty and nothing works
[6:19:16] RogueBear: you cant nap through your jail time either right?
[6:19:29] Gamertrigg: make em break rocks or make reg plates
[6:19:43] Dark_Prior88: No I mean something to RP, not just a job
[6:19:52] Oatmealyeti_: i havent seen any lifers so far in 4.0 either
[6:20:25] Oatmealyeti_: ya for sure
[6:20:44] htegamerking: especially with no one going to jail
[6:20:46] Oatmealyeti_: it just kinda sucks for new players that dunno what to do when they wind up in there haha
[6:20:46] warnivea: whats a lifer ?
[6:20:57] RogueBear: @warnivea life sentence

[6:21:11] Bagsnificent: lol
[6:21:15] Dark_Prior88: The prison in general just doesn't work right now. There where 6 ppl stuck way longer than their time cause the let out mechanic didn't work

[6:21:49] Frank_282: Also one point, Jay almost became a lifer
[6:22:08] Dark_Prior88: Cornwood had to come let them out
[6:22:12] GoldGuardianX: Ellum went to jail? om
[6:22:13] Aminimouse: It's broken but naps fix it, supposedly
[6:22:15] Oatmealyeti_: on the jan 6th arrests they couldnt use the yellow phone it just didnt work
[6:22:21] Dark_Prior88: Or they had to jump off a tower and die
[6:22:24] Oatmealyeti_: it works most the time tho
[6:22:34] jojoppa: hmmm
[6:22:51] jojoppa: not sure
[6:23:09] Dark_Prior88: Maybe but Vivek did it and he just woke up in jail again
[6:23:10] Mavp21: oh yeah, that happened to Squeex. they tried to get out for like 20 minutes and were stuck
[6:23:15] AgentOrange666_: Yeah probably
[6:23:29] Oatmealyeti_: the actual payphones not working kinda sucks too lol
[6:23:29] AgentOrange666_: Dunno
[6:23:31] alenas_izumi: raises hand and yeh
[6:23:33] DruminDriver: Not sure who streams ONX
[6:23:34] Aminimouse: Honest truth is ONX is the Kick to NoPixel's twitch
[6:23:36] RozzG_: Shruge
[6:23:40] warnivea: didnt know onx existed until know
[6:23:42] ZigSithExarKun: it different
[6:23:44] BTL_Bailey: I was watching Leg0s do sanitation runs this morning it was kinda neat
[6:23:44] RogueBear: i mean if people are gone from NP onto another server too long, the players get invested where they're at
[6:23:45] alenas_izumi: at least watching Legos it's fun
[6:23:54] sxnchez: oof
[6:23:56] GoldGuardianX: Everyone i follow thats on onx is a cop sooo
[6:23:58] aproxrambo: oof
[6:23:59] AgentOrange666_: Uhm that doesn't sound so good XD
[6:24:03] blahblahem: i've seen both and onx is way more entertaining to me, and they actually have cops unlike nopixel
[6:24:33] AgentOrange666_: They didn't hire ka...
[6:24:35] DruminDriver: is there more crime on ONX?
[6:24:38] ZigSithExarKun: Hmm
[6:24:46] animeshuun: I was watching Esfand and when I saw the PD they had like 15+ people
[6:24:54] Oatmealyeti_: i think its just tough to have that level of organization in a fairly short period of time
[6:24:59] BTL_Bailey: Crime is in full swing on ONX
[6:25:06] jessssn: Cop RP on ONX is great crim is meh
[6:25:07] Aminimouse: PD right now is too serious so most former cop players don't want to play cop lol
[6:25:11] Mars_nights: Yeah a bunch of the cops I liked to watch are on onx now yeeCry
[6:25:13] AlessT__: i think onx has all the necessary components to be greaat but i think no pixel coming out a week after killed it
[6:25:20] Indican: They have over 500 applicants for PD, so it will take time. They have to train as well.
[6:25:22] RogueBear: as far as i remember, a lot of players have fallen through the cracks on thier PD apps too
[6:25:29] jojoppa: nodd
[6:25:29] Bornit: Kyle SadCat
[6:25:34] ZigSithExarKun: most YEP
[6:25:50] AlessT__: rip croc
[6:25:56] AgentOrange666_: Yeah but most for quicker training
[6:26:05] GoldGuardianX: It would also help them stock up on cops that would know how to fto
[6:26:08] blahblahem: when ziggy and snow arent in PD something is def wrong
[6:26:10] Mars_nights: The nopixel pd feels skeleton crew and a bad skeleton crew with a gem here and there
[6:26:21] Tarikws: He is but Shiesty is bad at paperwork and gets shit on
[6:26:22] warnivea: ye denzel is a good cop but makes some mistakes, and captain ruth just wants to get rid of him
[6:26:24] AgentOrange666_: Like get them maybe with new characters and let them do training?
[6:26:32] DruminDriver: I think you'll see more cops as more crime is unlocked
[6:26:33] GoldGuardianX: What in the female adam
[6:26:35] NotReallyAScientist: Dundee was the crim, Croc was the cop
[6:26:39] NashXXIII: lmao
[6:26:45] Mars_nights: Adam?
[6:26:51] Mars_nights: KEKW
[6:26:55] Mars_nights: om
[6:26:56] jointspecialist: lolwtf
[6:26:58] ZigSithExarKun: KEKW
[6:27:15] Aminimouse: People just don't wanna play cop cuz it's too serious and not fun right now. (OOC info) Denzel and Cornwood, two of the most entertaining cops imo, both suspended for not doing things 100% to standard
[6:27:18] ithurtswhenlP2: Is it true that snr buns is giving pay slips more frequently now?
[6:27:58] animeshuun: @Aminimouse wait cornwood got suspended?? when
[6:28:04] tasteliketaro: PUKERS
[6:28:26] blahblahem: NP PD feels structured to appease XQC frogs then to actually build a good department in RP
[6:28:41] Dark_Prior88: @animeshuun that was a few weeks ago I think...
[6:29:00] XCII_Caelus: juh
