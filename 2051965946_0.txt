[4:26:28] spoonfullofMusic: like no one used it on weed with a strain probably right?
[4:26:30] ky05uk3: Might be worth running a rack of harvest kit stuff
[4:26:40] ky05uk3: like 3 to see the time

[5:51:54] scha_de: He's on this 3.0 PD was so much better trip, wants all the old cops back, and also become sheriff of the BCSO - basically because he heavily dislikes how 4.0 PD is shaped and disagrees with the 3 captains
[5:52:11] slorebear: i want to arrest buddha and xqc

[6:20:24] zuckscalulator: 20k for u total is 34 k
[6:20:43] NemisizZ: ideally you want it so you got dry weed every day, question is just how many racks you would need to make that happen, of course also depending on how much u sling
[6:20:48] Suvaacc: you also need to update log everytime someone pays you or else its all chaos
[6:21:42] MadChemistTHC: suv cop?
[6:21:49] FubarSilver: house and 3 appts set up growing on consecutive days type stuff?
[6:21:51] zuckscalulator: No wait it's 16k for u and 34k in total @travpiper
[6:22:30] Suvaacc: lovemore is only one who pushes a lot i think, 4head is too adhd, ak does civ work at same time and ming is busy a lot of times with washing
[6:22:40] NemisizZ: question is, would it just be smarter to sell the wet weed at a lower cost
[6:22:42] zuckscalulator: Ahhh 25 not 20
[6:22:45] zuckscalulator: Ok
[6:22:53] EnigmaQuip: gross not net, there's loss in converting bills
[6:22:57] GILLETTEBESTAMANCANGET: they sell 18 per now or more
[6:23:07] keikobeans: they should do a 33% split for you, the seller and a house pot
[6:23:15] MadChemistTHC: I mean selling to Dex is easy and quick
[6:23:20] Suvaacc: maybe try to sell it to vagos if they dont have strain one yet?
[6:23:31] FubarSilver: Whos lsinging now? isnt fanny upping her rep ready to sling?
[6:23:36] scha_de: @keikobeans house pot will never be a thing with this group

[6:24:50] Suvaacc: do people even wanna buy strained weed outside hq group
[6:24:50] NemisizZ: those other boxes, under the humidity things, should try and put 1 wet weed in that and see if it has any effect on it
[6:24:54] scha_de: 5 bricks ready, no one selling classic
[6:25:03] MadChemistTHC: they should have a drying percentage on the weed icons

[6:32:34] 90honeydew: @onix146 yeah but if you think about it you save more money waiting for things to be fixed and after because pc and the parts are cheap now too
[6:32:57] onix146: 90honeydew of course, i'm saying what everyone is trying to do
[6:33:30] 1evilshark: so long as they have few bricks when they wake up every thing is dandy

[6:35:38] LePtitGrec75: 4 days crazy long tbh
[6:36:29] Gladie209: I think you cracked the code with appartments
[6:36:52] NemisizZ: it is and isnt that long, it is long all considered how long it takes to grow a plant, but in the grand scheme 4 days isnt really a big deal
[6:37:17] scha_de: 4 days technically doesnt matter after the initial wait period

[6:44:06] legoliket: Ye
[6:44:33] scha_de: crank up the heat in this b*tch
[6:45:18] Suvaacc: isnt there only 2 heater in house already LUL
[6:45:35] legoliket: No there is more @suvaacc
[6:45:48] EnigmaQuip: they took some out for the mining
[6:45:50] NemisizZ: there was a lot at some point
[6:45:54] ky05uk3: also the server racks pump out a lot of heat right?
[6:46:01] Suvaacc: pretty sure someone removed a lot, when you discovered the crypto thing
[6:46:19] onix146: OMEGALAUGHING dry the weed with the heat of the mining rack
[6:47:23] ky05uk3: seems like they've solved a lot of the house rendering stuff
[6:47:32] NemisizZ: is that random or?
[6:47:35] NemisizZ: the qual that is
[6:47:59] NemisizZ: ngl, think the cooling might play into the heating and neutralizing it
[6:48:02] Suvaacc: has anyone ever even had 100% brick yet? it seems like drying takes so long every time that brick comes out already below 100
[6:48:45] ky05uk3: daily time?
[6:48:56] Suvaacc: maybe if you crack the code, you can have 100% bag
[6:49:28] onix146: bragging Shruge
[6:49:43] Suvaacc: dont bags also get same quality as brick?
[6:50:08] Suvaacc: and bags quality i think matter for how much they sell for
[6:50:25] Suvaacc: i'm not sure at what % it starts to lower the payout tho
[6:50:27] ky05uk3: is that the girl from earlier?
[6:50:28] MadChemistTHC: I like how Groove has a bunch of crackheads running around these days
[6:50:35] MadChemistTHC: travpiES
[6:51:12] Suvaacc: i might be completely wrong tho, maybe quality matters only for rep, they have changed to weed to many times
[6:52:39] Suvaacc: if quality doesnt matter for payout then wouldnt it be better to just make everything to bags right away, then always get 100 baggies
