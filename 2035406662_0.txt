[0:46:36] Splashy_Pants: good use case is a criminal courier that has an alibi
[0:46:50] kentripp: their could be a centralized weed grower and use grime as the deliver system to pushers
[0:46:50] TheAsvin: I hope they do something like amazon drone delivery. It would be a fun RP talk and maybe a use for the boxes.
[0:46:52] DarthRadonis: Yea
[0:46:52] seanbball14: Maybe it's a slot thing?
[0:47:00] deadestlorti: not yet anyways

[0:47:53] dootadoo: They need a warrant to look in the box?
[0:48:00] lightstormclaw: ya but they would need dogs too sniff out for them to check cars
[0:48:02] kentripp: but not have the grime deliverers be the sellers, have them give it to foot soldiers pushing on the street that way the deliverer doesn't get inged
[0:48:05] aldrichsea: @dootadoo that's my thinking
[0:48:06] bluewind5v: hmm.. how much weigh can a box hold?
[0:48:07] nate921269: but if it’s in a box they willl sure have fun opening all the boxes in the truck if u got like 50 in there
