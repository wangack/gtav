[3:36:47] trankesdello: it would be funny if outside hurt you when you are high rep
[3:36:54] thrwy: fell on a bullet, 9 times
[3:37:02] Fugeki: also for crims to come down and get fixed by sewer doc would be sick
[3:37:12] rhubarb_carl: All it took was a splint to save someone's mobility. A splint can't be used in crime.
[3:37:18] RoyLeeTV: oof

[3:38:08] InkyBeanVT: 6 raiders from InkyBeanVT have joined! 
[3:38:13] 91xex: Do you think they’re gonna do any back Ali doctor work?

[3:38:58] Sword_Scream: It has always been a tough thing to balance on NP. The best paid doctors were therapists, who were paid by other players just for the therapy RP.
[3:39:00] kingkoolkattz: but it also doesn't help that all the civilian jobs pay like shit unless its G6 or grime but thats barely even good either

[3:39:18] numbertwodooky: YEP if there was more events for docs, it wouldnt be as much of a problem
[3:39:31] Daemon_Hood: Imagine a minigame for proctology xdding
[3:39:37] uros_1998: Yes I think civilians don't have much to do
[3:39:42] Mr_Feyshade: Operation app? Don't touch the sides!
[3:39:44] jberg987: Harder than the car repair kit

[3:40:54] TheMorgaborg: He's the giant rat that makes all of the rules
[3:40:55] DarthRadonis: So they lied Hmm

[3:42:51] kingkoolkattz: @jayrowzy that happens often, instead of working out the issue they always settle for the solution of nerfing something that doesn't need to be nerfed or over tunning something WAY too much while yes its something that needs buffed
