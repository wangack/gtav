[1:47:14] NinjaTexan: there's cheap ones
[1:47:15] NemisizZ: depends which u want
[1:47:27] NemisizZ: better to say whats ur budget lol
[1:47:36] NemisizZ: id say 500 and u get a good one
[1:47:45] NemisizZ: a 1000 is like the best on the market
[1:47:57] NemisizZ: but thats going balls deep
[1:48:03] Nightbot: stay up to date on shit - twitter.com/travpiper | instagram.com/travpiper
[1:48:15] Aliaga_xc: 300-500 for a good printer
[1:48:19] NinjaTexan: cheap ones are like 170, but I don't know about quality
[1:48:20] daffodil86: 500 would get you a decent one, 300 would be more budget friendly
[1:48:32] NemisizZ: like the best on the market out of the box no tinkering and that shit is a bamboo or maybe a prusa
[1:48:42] Aliaga_xc: all you need is to convert your render into stl file and copy that onto the sd card that comes with 3d rpinter

[1:49:32] Phatphuk420: lol
[1:49:36] Headss: KEKW
[1:50:23] NemisizZ: usually the cheaper ones, like sub 300 id say usually gonna require way more tinkering
[1:50:34] daffodil86: ^yeah
[1:50:49] NemisizZ: u can get them cheaper, but dont expect it to do magic without you sinking a lot of hours into the printer
[1:50:49] Nightbot: IMGONNACUM
[1:50:50] daffodil86: even to just get settings and speeds right
[1:51:04] NemisizZ: yeah
[1:54:28] daffodil86: resin might be a good idea for lure details, but is slightly more involved
[1:54:53] NemisizZ: this is prolly the best printer out of the box printer on the market, like top of the line.. https://us.store.bambulab.com/products/x1-carbon-3d-printer
[1:55:30] daffodil86: yeah bambulabs. And it’s a core x,y not a bedslinger

[1:56:19] weaselinap: was tha t a cad for a shad
[1:56:24] weaselinap: it is
[1:56:26] weaselinap: Pog
[1:56:34] daffodil86: yeah plus heater chamber for diff filaments
[1:57:12] FatBored: I said this last time this came up but for most people PLA will do everything fine, i printed without an enclosure for a long time without issues
[1:57:40] spoonfullofMusic: welcome to 3d modelling KEKW
[1:57:42] daffodil86: that’s true Bored
[1:57:43] NemisizZ: ngl, think a lot of that would be faster in blender
[1:57:49] NemisizZ: where u can sculpt it
[1:58:08] NemisizZ: lol true
[1:58:09] nebrasken: @travpiper is that CAD? what program is that?
[1:58:20] daffodil86: yeah fusion360 is parametric based
[1:58:21] slorebear: fusion 360
[1:58:56] nebrasken: never heard of fusion 360, looks very indepth and time consuming though
[1:58:58] FatBored: The difference is that in blender you can "sculpt" things like you would in real life, if you prefer that workflow over setting angles and curves etc
[1:59:09] NemisizZ: u also need to think about some details doesnt translate that well on a fdm printer
[1:59:09] Nightbot: IMGONNACUM
[2:00:01] labsrat44: filament disposition
[2:00:08] NemisizZ: fdm is those where you have a spool of filament where the printhead zooms around
[2:01:01] daffodil86: resin would give you much better detail, especially in terms of fin, scale, eye and pattern detail
[2:01:02] FatBored: 0.08 layer height on the bambu is pretty insane, the overhangs/supports are where the issues will be
[2:01:03] NemisizZ: resin is one that dips down and then it got a picture below of the layer that it expose with uv light which can give you crazy details
[2:01:17] Aliaga_xc: if you have sharp angles and very detailed projects, resin printers would be the best. The only problem is that they usually print smaller objects then traditional filmaent based printers
[2:02:14] slorebear: jenneti makes a dollar, dickhead makes a dime, thats why dickhead poops on company time
[2:02:16] NemisizZ: yeah if you want high detail, where the resolution is high, then its def a resin printer you want... like if you wanna make table top figs and that for example
[2:03:10] Nightbot: stay up to date on shit - twitter.com/travpiper | instagram.com/travpiper
[2:03:56] daffodil86: aren’t most resin chambers like 150mm to 200mm that’s enough for a 6-8 inch lure
[2:04:11] Nightbot: All my content is free, but if you would like to support please feel free to sub <3 https://www.twitch.tv/products/travpiper
[2:04:32] NemisizZ: no what you do is that u print it on the resin, where u get high details and that, then you make a mold of that in silicone
[2:04:52] FatBored: You can get good results for things like this with an FDM, but you'll need to sand it and prime it and shit if you want it to be smooth
[2:05:02] MadChemistTHC: airbrushing is fun. i used to paint my own crankbaits
[2:05:18] daffodil86: yeah that’s also an option Bored
[2:05:27] EleMENTALL: what is this?
[2:05:51] NemisizZ: workflow as u say
[2:05:57] MadChemistTHC: i used to buy cheap cranks from the barging bins, sand them down, and paint them
[2:05:58] FatBored: @daffodil86 yeah it's what I do for my masters rather than have to deal with a resin printer
[2:06:02] daffodil86: there is def a learning curve to fusion
[2:06:03] MadChemistTHC: kinda shitty but its wa fun
[2:06:46] daffodil86: @fatbored yeah dude, either way post processing right. Just depends what you’d rather do
[2:07:18] FatBored: And what you want, because for fishing baits you don't necessarily need it perfectly finished, but you may as well go all the way
[2:07:47] daffodil86: very true
[2:08:11] FatBored: The shit I make has to have like optical smoothness and clarity and it's a nightmare
[2:08:25] daffodil86: I’ve seen some rapalas that shouldn’t have passed QC lol
[2:09:28] daffodil86: precision, chasing 0s, and perfection is a disease lol
[2:09:55] Hedgehog721: Autodesk stuff is pretty expensive, right?
[2:10:32] daffodil86: commercially it’s not cheap but you can get a free version if your not making money off it

[3:11:15] Bulfwyne: he's making a mold
[3:11:29] krush_267: my texting is shit today lol
[3:11:29] Bulfwyne: so he can make a soft plastic version to fish with
[3:12:10] Bulfwyne: One mold i've never seen around, is where you can put a hook inside the mold, fill with plastic so its already "Rigged" kinda thing
[3:12:34] krush_267: I can’t text
[3:12:39] krush_267: I’m on mobile
[3:12:47] Bulfwyne: I've never used this program myself before, so I'm thinking Daff knows more than me :D
[3:12:48] daffodil86: think it’s because the object is on the image at the bottom of the body.
[3:13:22] krepana: he really bought a bandage to use it in front of a doctor
[3:13:26] daffodil86: yeah face is the model. a plane is usually on the xy or z
[3:13:40] krush_267: so you going to 3D mold it?
[3:14:11] krush_267: you have a 3D printer pog
[3:14:17] daffodil86: so the circle is on the image, which is on the x axis not the face or surface of the model
[3:14:47] Bulfwyne: you trying to make the eye pop out or recess into the body ? cause then you could glue eyes in it if you get the right measurement and stuff
[3:14:54] krush_267: how do you donate
[3:15:01] krush_267: I’m on mobile
[3:15:02] GoutOfWar: local libraries might have 3d printers

[3:28:18] spoonfullofMusic: you mean curve? KEKW
[3:28:58] Bulfwyne: looks a little flat on the plane instead of contouring with the fish head i think he means
[3:29:26] Bulfwyne: but looks like it gives a "Brow" with attitude so thats pretty neat tbh :D
[3:29:42] Bulfwyne: LUL Rammee
[3:29:43] spoonfullofMusic: hear me out, this fish needs a mustache
