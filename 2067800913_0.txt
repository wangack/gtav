[0:32:27] krimbo87: firing cops now is dumb
[0:32:28] Krimson07_: NODDERS cadet den
[0:32:29] RonJon: to decide that right

[0:32:30] bulbasaursmeow: save den
[0:32:31] talamah: Chatting personally, I think you should
[0:32:31] Buffalohed: frost needs to be fired b4 anyone
[0:32:34] Gabilonski: he has improved and hiring in the PD has been slow
[0:32:38] KooterNoodle: are you trying to make 4.0 police rp like Reno 911 or an actual police simulator.
[0:32:38] RonJon: the point of the review is to decide that together is it not
[0:32:40] ShinJiHun: fire Denzel, hire Den LUL
[0:32:42] Vince_dev_: its not fair, he does so much good work and improved alot since early DAPS
[0:32:45] Gabilonski: cant afford to lose people like this
[0:32:46] galaxy21212121: hy u look like a scout boy? Get on duty and entertain us
[0:32:48] vellooci: I feel like terminations should only happen in cases of literal malicious behavior not mistakes
[0:32:49] TheTourist_: poor guy got so unlucky with that last dap it still cracks me up
[0:32:50] Moobot: Thanks for subbing, k1lluaBug! Welcome to the Saabscribers! saabH

[0:32:52] Ryaht: no point
[0:32:54] dakota22446: saabNote
[0:32:56] RonJon: no way
[0:32:57] UA_Shark: hes done much better
[0:32:57] Krimson07_: KEKL
[0:33:00] Artsii1994: I mean even if he has improved is he willing to show that improvement or will he go back to his old ways.
[0:33:00] JasmineWynn: was he part of the skeleton crew?
[0:33:02] bazoski1er: fire cornfraud for the memes
[0:33:04] DarkMatroX: i would not fire him because he will be first in line that cornwood will call when he gets his new roll
[0:33:05] galaxy21212121: Saab what is this yappin about?
[0:33:07] ShinJiHun: I'm sure he'll feel that way KLEKW
[0:33:08] Ryaht: have him ride with a senior officer for a week
[0:33:09] Velehoh: snr. buns security duty for a week should do it Aware
[0:33:09] RonJon: he would way prefer to be a cadet than fired
[0:33:09] ShinJiHun: KEKW
[0:33:10] RobRoads: He can be a part of the sherifs office
[0:33:11] lookingfornothinghere: he didnt even do the same mistake again he literally got fucked by being unlucky
[0:33:11] yeovic: i would just look at the daps given and see if he improved
[0:33:11] Zazun_: @Buffalohed Juicer alert
[0:33:12] tellos0: does he need to go back to academy?
[0:33:12] tieman2: making him cadet is worsen
[0:33:12] tofuhai: how long until a decision is made? it has been so long already
[0:33:15] AKing33: That last dap watching the clip can't even see the people until after the pit sadge
[0:33:17] marneraiders: He improved immensely, like paperwork, SOP
[0:33:18] tellos0: he's a full time officer, right?
[0:33:19] Doqx42: No way Den needs fired
[0:33:19] hiimlucii: PPO for few days?
[0:33:20] Killsauce: I mean compared to how johnson handled it den was great
[0:33:21] Drkdream: could be a week of not being able to solo patrol or something
[0:33:22] galaxy21212121: castrate him
[0:33:23] RonJon: he would way prefer to be a cadet than fired.
[0:33:25] nickgmiller: I think if he gets to come back he will be a great cop
[0:33:26] KoppaVRP: You’ve shown with Johnson your holding people accountable, when den you could show people that it means just because you get suspended it’s not the end
[0:33:27] KooterNoodle: Johnson keeps getting nerfed in the city lol
[0:33:30] WildWillie419: I think it’d be fair to wait until his first DAPs wear off
[0:33:33] Kaztiell: Den-zel gets fired, Den-x joins the force
[0:33:33] focustft: @quinnntino nothing - they're just mad
[0:33:35] Hardpu: hire back, but probationary
[0:33:37] Krimson07_: i think firing in this case is too much imo
[0:33:39] JerrieDepp: put him on a test to see if it's worth for him to return? maybe?
[0:33:48] quinnntino: @focustft ah alright
[0:33:50] Buffalohed: @Buffalohed nah just calling out meta and pg
[0:33:51] marneraiders: Make him work Footpatrol (he can pit anyone on foot) CarlSmile
[0:33:52] strawberryraye: Agreed.
[0:33:53] muricapewpew: to be fair, some of his daps were very questionable
[0:33:56] MsFreya_x: Have someone else be the example
[0:33:58] talamah: @Buffalohed get over it
[0:34:03] TJK__07: Make someone mentor over for a week and see how he does
[0:34:04] Artsii1994: If you could. Ring him back you could make him do task thats could bring those privalges back
[0:34:07] WildWillie419: Den trying so hard Sadge
[0:34:08] dakota22446: ssaabExplainingWhy
[0:34:10] CuBanMumzy: Honestly think Den is a great cop, it would be wasted to fire him
[0:34:11] Evilzanz: ey the last dap was just silly
[0:34:16] RonJon: I think it really helps his case that his last dap wasn't that huge of a deal and he was pretty ok about it
[0:34:19] Scully_18: It’s crazy that De Rolo still has a badge…..
[0:34:22] HustlerOneX: tbf Den Zel was solid for weeks... the Johnson DAP was just plain bad luck
[0:34:23] Pee_aRe: that dap was so uncalled for
[0:34:23] lookingfornothinghere: McNulty put it best every single Cop hired would have pitted there

[0:34:32] seanlew123: but are they not told to pit when its safe
[0:34:32] Vince_dev_: give him another chance saabH
[0:34:33] Drkdream: KEKW
[0:34:33] UA_Shark: Just make him spend a day with duncan then he will never get 10 daps again
[0:34:34] Killsauce: the dap was justified he's just unlucky it was him and he was at 9 already
[0:34:35] itsxavierrrrrr: Seems unfair for him to be used as an example though, people have made worse pits before that
[0:34:37] Krimson07_: OMEGALAUGHING
[0:34:38] 95eagles: DeRolo got off easy lol

[0:35:50] JoshGB_: With den could you wait until his first daps fall of taking him back under 10 then allow him to continue?
[0:35:51] lookingfornothinghere: the real question is when and to which franchise are you trading Duncan to? Snr Buns or Grime
[0:35:51] marneraiders: Imagine turner sees you with that cop, it would end with a public execution…
[0:35:51] UA_Shark: @Eddie1225  saabKEK

[1:39:24] talamah: wideduckass ffzW
[1:39:32] sdfg_1: why is duncan still standing there LUL
[1:39:35] SmugPls: This is more an IC excuse to ignore old pd characters in favor of new officers with old pd players
[1:39:36] Pandrax86: @taraannee A lot of seniors and leadership (minus captains) were pretty experienced in in PD prior to 4.0
[1:39:40] noah_a_104: @dakota22446 wtf lmao
[1:39:46] hoanzlgoas: @Shae__Void she has no time for RP, has to grow her butt
[1:39:49] c0rnishatheart: Be experienced but bring a new cop win
[1:39:55] Lukeyguy: Zac will be good but she's doing radio now :(

[1:40:08] taraannee: @pandrax86 ya aren’t a decent chunk of regular officers priors as well? most cadets from past 2 months seem to be gone
[1:40:16] Ned15: @SmugPls it's not an excuse, it's facts, Old characters want their past back
[1:40:21] Artsii1994: Know what your doing stop crime and get the w
[1:40:26] Lukeyguy: @ryaht people also bave lives 🤣
[1:40:28] Thraxton1: the problem is when cops are so stressed and having to pingpong between calls constantly they are going to fall back on old ways and cant be as thourogh with procedures
[1:40:33] PsychoJoker: @Shae__Void nmpSuffer Clap We all knew mizkif and her wouldnt last lets be honest LUL they do too much IRL
[1:40:34] PietertjeNL: Duncan could be out patrolling all this time
[1:40:35] hoanzlgoas: At least Penny might come back tomorrow
[1:40:37] MWRGaming: 99A?
[1:40:38] c0rnishatheart: Old characters have been causing problems
[1:40:44] trends0: Duncan right back to camping at MRPD
[1:40:45] Pandrax86: @taraannee A lot of the "new" officers who had no previous experience have.. sort of dropped off honestly. it sucks because they were good RP.
[1:40:51] jasonarce: PD wants drones. Characters later. That's the sad truth.
[1:40:54] angrycrumpet13: Duncan could've literally sent slacks a message to say he's going on patrol and to msg him back when he's done talking. BUT oh no let's stand there the whole time
[1:40:55] citrusMangos: duncan could have been patrolling for the last 30 minutes
[1:40:55] Ryaht: @Lukeyguy yes ofc, one of his points was that most ppl are not in his situation
[1:40:56] shae__void: @psychojoker true true KEKW but i do miss the content sometimes KEKW

[1:41:25] Artsii1994: New charecters is good in spicing up  the circle
[1:41:26] spacelindsay2: moon2HUH sounds like some pussy liberal shit
[1:41:29] taraannee: @pandrax86 ya i kinda feel like that’s not proving the caps’ opinion of old pd..
[1:41:30] ShinJiHun: Duncan gone?
[1:41:31] RonJon: *duncan standing still for 30 mins*
[1:41:33] strawberryraye: Nekkoda is such a great character.
[1:41:37] Ned15: @sirsalem13 saying that is like saying, he is too good, let him go LuL
[1:41:42] hoanzlgoas: Whats with Aziz, is he also on break?

[1:42:01] Aitchemdee: def need some better drivers and units that parallel correctly
[1:42:01] Ned15: Look at all those calls and Duncan Waiting
[1:42:03] layla109: Duncan is really given 'daddy issues'. LOL
[1:42:04] lookingfornothinghere: Ruby GIGACHAD McNulty GIGACHAD
[1:42:04] Xellwrath: Chat did denzel's verdict happen?
[1:42:06] LeZenon: Duncaning  did i hear promote
[1:42:07] foxweazel: @sirsalem13 lol good joke. Den isn't good enough for the pd, that's why he is suspended
[1:42:15] jasonarce: @artsii1994 character cops will get fired fast
[1:42:16] RonJon: @massteroid Slacks told him to go wait somewhere else twice
[1:42:16] angrycrumpet13: He's not even on his MDT anymore 😂
[1:42:16] Artsii1994: @ronjon i was having hope there i was having hope
[1:42:18] Syn1285: @Xellwrath no
[1:42:19] PandaNomsBamboo: Duncan promote me to sgt rizzed
[1:42:19] jessielight: ruby york is amazing
[1:42:24] prodiac: I really hope Slacks sneaks out behind him lmao
[1:42:25] MillerThyme: been two months, this new pd strategy didnt work, pack it up, new plan.
[1:42:25] LoneSoldier021: Duncan has just been standing there for how long now…?
[1:42:25] Pandrax86: @taraannee The old PD peoples have been reliable and on the clock pretty much on queue. The issue is like Saab says, they tend to come in with their own expectations and feelings on how it should be.
[1:42:27] BurningFlag: Slacks ignores Duncan after this meeting Prayge
[1:42:28] lookingfornothinghere: yeah just bc there are some bad eggs you shouldnt just say old cops are bad
[1:42:29] PsychoJoker: @foxweazel thats actually fucked up Den works hard
[1:42:30] sirsalem13: @ned15 I just feel bad for him. His crim character is interesting and honestly seems a lot less stressful but I know he misses PD.
[1:42:30] gucciflare: sgt mcnulty
[1:42:40] Jibry: Ruby for SGT Prayge
[1:42:43] ForgottenJones: Duncaning Promotion ??
[1:42:45] tofuhai: kinda crazy how shift 2 is the hardest shift but also the most up good shift
[1:42:46] HeyMeghan: Duncan stream sniping lol he’s standing just off camera so we can’t see him. (jk)
[1:42:51] taraannee: nah retention is down bad lmao
[1:42:55] jasonarce: He so right
[1:43:00] strawberryraye: @HeyMeghan  lolllll
[1:43:02] albakrut: In order for people to grow and become part of the bigger picture, they need mentors, captains in action. if people only hear words and loud speeches, but do not see strong leaders, then what can they expect from them?
[1:43:02] foxweazel: @psychojoker OK. Working hard and doing a poor job isn't a good thing
[1:43:03] johnmalkovich95: @jessielight i think her character too soft in bad situations and scene control bruh
[1:43:05] Ned15: Yeah this is almost a real job LuL
[1:43:12] Artsii1994: @jessielight ruby has been one if my favorite seniors in the od her and mcnulty they have been the best people for the job as seniors
[1:43:12] Ned15: FULL time Job
[1:43:14] talamah: Chatting bruh
[1:43:16] drukkz: LULW
[1:43:18] Capn_Stew: Ruby or McNulty would make great sgts.
[1:43:19] PsychoJoker: Hate watchers classic
[1:43:25] Pandrax86: Retention is down, people actually clocking in and working is pretty high though. lots of burn out kicking in.
[1:43:29] jadetortoise: ruby woulld be a great sgt
[1:43:32] strawberryraye: Ruby, Viv and McNulty are BOSSES
[1:43:34] sirsalem13: Ruby is great
[1:43:36] Ned15: I feel bad for cops that have IRL jobs and then have to deal with crims in RP LuL
[1:43:39] WildWillie419: I couldn’t be an RP cop with a full time desk job already LUL
[1:43:43] Lukeyguy: @capn_stew 100% they've been amazing
[1:43:49] DjSprayK: Any update on Den Zel?
[1:43:53] Ned15: @WildWillie419 me neither
[1:43:53] taraannee: that’s kinda why imo old pd characters can be good bc they know the work load & still wanna do it. but def need fresh chars too
[1:44:08] angrycrumpet13: Duncan has left the room guys.... to go and talk to McNulty
[1:44:12] TheTourist_: monkaS duncan in the vents
[1:44:17] Ned15: @WildWillie419 imagine coming home from work, then coming to deal with crims and paperwork Aware
[1:44:18] layla109: From what I've seen/ heard, another huge problem with PD is the training. FTO's need mentors that will stick with them throughout the week, not leaving them to float around.
[1:44:19] ryuudrg: time to open the doors for a new department
[1:44:21] sirsalem13: @angrycrumpet13 LUL
[1:44:21] Artsii1994: @djsprayk no they need to have a talm about it aldo let him know that.
[1:44:26] Syn1285: does duncan patrol?

[1:44:36] Voivid: PD needs to make money to be ahead of crime and technology
[1:44:38] HeyMeghan: @strawberryraye idk about viv. there’s two instances of her escalating a scene then after someone else deescalates it she goes back in and reescalates.

[1:45:30] brawdyll: sherrifs office

[1:55:27] Ned15: Like shooting someone 20 times
[1:55:29] Ezi_GG: id let PD take a vote to nominate people for the position, then have a public vote between the selected candidates? I dunno seemed better in my head when it came to me
[1:55:33] Ned15: say you enjoyed it afterwards LuL
[1:55:33] Defonicx: duncan for chief of police PagMan
[1:55:35] Phattiest: reason being because you have dapped yourself so you would exclude yourself from being elected.....
[1:55:36] CuBanMumzy: ask city council about CoP and sherriff, why?
[1:55:36] Spired12: hope theres no issues with turner not being on for ooc issues, he'd be great for chief
[1:55:37] MWRGaming: or just PIT in the wrong part of town

[1:55:53] knowlightnofear: DAP'
[1:55:54] MonsterFuel: @jessielight fact or opinion? officers having to worry about DAPs holds them accountable
[1:55:56] Jibry: Slacks has 4 Daps so he is excluded
[1:56:00] ForgottenJones: Freedom
[1:56:01] CuBanMumzy: he just agreed wiht nekodda but thats not what he said to him, lol
[1:56:03] UA_Shark: Sheriff?
[1:56:06] knowlightnofear: DAP's are too subjective to have them as eliminators

[1:56:21] knowlightnofear: **some DAP's
[1:56:25] lookingfornothinghere: @Ssaab do the 3 Captains just get replaced by new picks from the CoP or do you 3 still keep the OOC HC power

[1:57:05] jessielight: @MonsterFuel yeah and make them ineffective when they hestitate. I just saw two officers not even detain a thief due to he needed to talk first. or not shoot or taze...crims  rule when cops don't have enough confidence to trust their choices
[1:57:06] Artsii1994: Oh he has an idea all right

[1:57:19] buddha_hands: @knowlightnofear it's not thaaaat subjective since they're based on guidelines + multiple people agreeing on the conclusions, but yeah
[1:57:27] stellarnaut: @knowlightnofear I think the problem is some DAPs seem given off outcome rather than blatant SOP break
[1:57:29] MWRGaming: @Eddie1225 be ready
[1:57:34] dakota22446: dankDesk

[1:58:19] JennSV: They already decided on what DOC would be? It wasn't just a thought as far as I understood?
[1:58:19] LHaxorP: not sure why everyone is worked up about Chief cornwood and esfand thinks turner should prbly be chief anyway.... just who knows cause of tuners rl stuff

[1:58:25] bobdang07hd: people realize daps fall off too right? Like its not the end of the world
[1:58:25] lookingfornothinghere: do the 3 current Captains get removed entirely

[1:58:31] Xellwrath: Its impossible when you're getting DAP'd for being a victim in a situation.
[1:58:31] Conner293: Completely agree broo
[1:58:34] cjohno20: 30 days is EZ
[1:58:35] talamah: then 60 for daps aint bad
[1:58:38] BIumenT0pF: made a mistake in a report 20 days ago, thats a DAP. no sheriff for you
[1:58:39] ancientpeas: My hot take is that I don't put pickled turnips on my shawarma.
[1:58:39] Smypher: @Ssaab Has Cornwood's daps fell off?
[1:58:39] driver1036: Cornwood will have zero soon

[1:58:39] xMarshVans: cmonBruh
[1:58:42] talamah: 30 is fine
[1:58:42] MillerThyme: Nahh you guys use DAPs as punitive measures instead of corrective measures tho. @Ssaab
[1:58:43] Pee_aRe: Den Zek 100% be great Chief of PD
[1:58:43] randybobndyphone: Liberal snowflake police department Kappa
[1:58:44] fellathedude: WoW brain
[1:58:44] Bigdan2140: You should review DAP Points then because people get DAP points for incidents and nobody else does. The system is already so bad
[1:58:45] xsilas43: cant it be abused the same way like the high command promotions?
[1:58:47] the_real_jfk: you said you didnt want the ability to block people because opf there rank but you can target people with daps
[1:58:48] Maatch: i just came here, what position he talking about chat?
[1:58:49] neft39157: Hi ssabb hope your vacation went well
[1:58:49] srejok: every cop ab to walk around like they are on eggshells when they hear this so they dont get dapd
[1:58:50] tofuhai: not getting dapped is not hard anybody that thinks otherwise is just a moron

[1:58:50] MsFreya_x: Ruth living rent free in some of yalls heads

[1:58:53] talamah: 4 weeks is nothing LULE
[1:58:54] korgx15: realistically, who are the officers that could be chief/sheriff?
[1:58:54] Ned15: @Smypher he has like two investigations for DAP pending lmao
[1:58:55] Artsii1994: 30 days is not that bad it's notice your gonna suffer with the rest of your life with it
[1:58:57] Emeralblade: Isn't earning it actually getting the votes to get elected? Are you saying your officers can't vote in the right people?
[1:58:57] my69thaccount: Cornwood literally done more than every cop combined
[1:58:58] laaazylemon: being voted in is literally earning it
[1:58:58] Drakkasaur: people make mistakes, and this is los santos. yall are nuts with the DAPs
[1:58:59] seanlew123: true @MillerThyme
[1:59:02] DonnBeach: Shiesty for Chief
[1:59:02] Konkwistador_1002: you could dap your competition
[1:59:03] Satic: Even a processing error like missing a warrant or something inoculous?
[1:59:04] Rychus4: Holy Smadging
[1:59:04] Thraxton1: Turner needs to be chief, he's the most balanced,fair and competent of the captains
[1:59:04] marneraiders: 1 DAP for Uniform infractions?
[1:59:05] postAmongUsist: YEP crims had to step getting caught for 30+ days to become mayors in 3.0 its definitely possible
[1:59:06] dKs89: all im saying is that meeting with the mayor whenever it happens is gonna be juicy
[1:59:06] BackStageDoor: so no DAPs means you’re a better cop?
[1:59:06] murasakikimono: True. Take the job seriously. saabH
[1:59:06] GlitchyByte: daps can be weaponized
[1:59:06] Zhaelph: how many people in the current PD have 0 daps
[1:59:07] dapyman: As a devils advocate. A Captain that does like someone could give a single DAP just to eliminate someone
[1:59:07] MonsterFuel: YEP
[1:59:08] jessielight: crims get time for minutes and cops for days..that is so out of balance. it has to be meet in the middle somewhere
[1:59:09] Vexamas: @Ssaab The issue is, your rational behind not having COMMAND *only* to do chief makes sense for the same reason why Dabs might be bad - Command can SUBJECTIVELY hand out daps, causing bias
[1:59:09] Krimson07_: R U T H FOR COMMISSIONER
[1:59:09] Zazun_: Just he works so many hours
[1:59:10] Korlinni: It makes sense
[1:59:10] GYNECHIATRIST: don't gatekeep how we feel UltraMad
[1:59:11] Spired12: but my streamer needs to win
[1:59:12] Abdullah_8499: tbh daps makes officer to not got at there 100% bc they are scared of accidents happens that could lead them to lose job s
[1:59:13] Jaster_Reylu: should just talk with the mayor about it, he had ideas too
[1:59:14] reydedark: glizzyoverdrive
[1:59:14] a2th3vi: Should you provide that information to the rest of the PD so they are aware?
[1:59:14] eqnjn: Bro Kyle Pred would've never been sheriff with this mentality
[1:59:14] 95eagles: So when are you reviewing the ocean dump pits?

[1:59:15] JennSV: More active cops get the short end of that stick no? Someone who is online 5x more than another cop etc.
[1:59:15] moomanji: DAP could also allow command to influence the election though in a corrupt manner, DAP right before
[1:59:15] MsFreya_x: @my69thaccount more bad shit you are correct
[1:59:16] Kenpokesbarbie: How did the captains earn their positions
[1:59:17] ThePlatinumMeta: this issue is so systemic at this point i dont even know what can be done YEP
[1:59:17] srejok: yea they mayor ab to be pissed LUL
[1:59:17] marneraiders: You can get DAPed for having a clipping issue
[1:59:18] thaGrandpoobah88: But as high command with control of DAPs you are still able to gate keep the position
[1:59:18] jadetortoise: Consider the power dynamic where the one in charge can gatekeep candidates
[1:59:18] Pandrax86: The issue is a lot of people have DAPS, including leadership.  I want to see Slacks be the Chief, but even you have DAPS.
[1:59:19] yeovic: the more u are on, and the more u take responsibility the higher the chance of some daps. And im for daps counting whether u can get position or not
[1:59:19] monkz89: chief cornball would be a disaster KEKW
[1:59:20] Stromie00: the people who put in the high hours are more prone to getting Daps
[1:59:20] Hardpu: cop logs in once a week will have an easy time
[1:59:23] savy89: The DAP requirement seems fine, but I dunno about it just being 1. A great cop worthy of HC can still make a mistake
[1:59:23] buddha_hands: pepeMeltdown
[1:59:24] Jrony23: in order to have a good track record you need to be soft though...

[1:59:45] MWRGaming: @AivHell yes
[1:59:46] 1TrueTyrant: You say that, but then you have McNulty letting JP keep the mats he stole, but no DAPs cause whos gonna give it to him? Its dumb!
[1:59:47] Squidmyster: Simple solution. 30 months jail time for jaywalking. Doc budget granted
[1:59:47] neft39157: How about I propose to you
[1:59:47] Jaster_Reylu: doc?
[1:59:49] dakota22446: Aware jesus
[1:59:49] talamah: Yeah, but my parasocial streamer messed up and got punished, so the system fucking sucks
[1:59:49] BluebonnetRP: @Ned15 Prayge
[1:59:50] mcknizzle90: why are daps even a conversation when crims are taking over?
[1:59:50] Hardpu: no daps with a minimum amount of time logged in?
[1:59:51] c0rnishatheart: Chat obsessed with the dap system
[1:59:51] PanicAtNabisco: I don't fully agree with it but couldn't daps be used to gatekeep like limiting who can be elected?
[1:59:52] Spired12: so if slacks gets 1 more dap does he need to suspend himself
[1:59:53] lKouRa: does lenny have any dap?? @ssaab
[1:59:53] buddha_hands: POGSPIN did she say "I do" POGSPIN omg thats so cute he proposed!
[1:59:53] mathln: 2 cops done more fieldwork than anyone else, and one is suspended :)

[1:59:57] fact0rize: We all know Pier Paul should be chief LUL
[1:59:57] thesoursloth: its not impossible by any means, but it can just feel a little bad to lose that opportunity because you messed up once in a report in the last month
[1:59:58] MWRGaming: Homeless
[2:00:00] eqnjn: @RandomShungiteCD yeah NP PD missing good characters because being one gets your ass DAPed LUL
[2:00:02] Vexamas: @Ssaab The issue is, your rational behind not having COMMAND *only* eligible to do chief makes sense for the same reason why Dabs might be *bad* - Command can SUBJECTIVELY hand out daps, causing bias
[2:00:02] Bigdan2140: You should fix dap points first then
[2:00:03] TraviiiOnTwitch: it was the wording that DAPs = bad leader, i think that you are an example of that not being true
[2:00:05] SMStephanie: garbage can sam baas Prayge
[2:00:05] Brewday445: @bobdang07hd a lot of officers do not do certain things because they do not want to get a dap
[2:00:06] msnzonegamingadvocate: DAPs shouldnt come off after "x" days, DAPs should errode after "x" hours on duty
[2:00:06] the_real_jfk: could lead to daps being weaponized politically

[2:00:13] Ned15: Ned15 gifted a Tier 1 sub to BluebonnetRP! They have given 1057 Gift Subs in the channel!

[2:00:17] jasonarce: 2 dap limited. Daps happen
[2:00:18] Eddie1225: its insane
[2:00:18] Eddie1225: OMEGALAUGHING
[2:00:20] ThePlatinumMeta: @Eddie1225 if all the captains have daps, how can anybody expect to meet the reqirements to be chief?
[2:00:20] BluebonnetRP: @Ned15 Thanks for the gift sub! saabH saabH saabH
[2:00:20] jollypnda: I mean if DAPs turn into 3.0 strikes then its wraps
[2:00:21] jd2881: DAPs need to be consistent though. There's no shot Denzel was the only person who had someone injured during a chase via pit or just straight up hitting someone.
[2:00:23] HeyMeghan: I mean this in the most respectful way possible. you just said someone with DAPS can’t be a good leader so are you then saying the captains and seniors with daps are not good leaders?
[2:00:23] ForgottenJones: Ruby for Chief

[2:00:42] ShadyMashX: Yall gonna ruin this pd with this dap stuff
[2:00:47] BluebonnetRP: @Artsii1994 Here's hoping man, really excited to possibly get involved in it!
[2:00:48] Pandrax86: You need to have more than just strict leadership. Chief of Police would be a perfect fit for Slacks. Sheriff is and has always been a far more lenient leadership role, especially IRL.
[2:00:50] ForgottenJones: oop
[2:00:52] stellarnaut: Ruby for chief
[2:00:54] fanatic101_: ruby CoP Prayge
[2:01:00] mcknizzle90: daps don’t mean shit but to destroy the PD when Crims don’t care and will do everything to ruin PD.
[2:01:04] MonsterFuel: @HeyMeghan hearing what you want OMEGALUL he didn't say you can't be a good leader with DAPs

[2:01:10] MWRGaming: ya ruby would be fair but strict too
[2:01:11] Vexamas: @Ssaab The issue is, your rational behind not having COMMAND *only* to do chief makes sense for the same reason why Dabs might be bad - Command can SUBJECTIVELY hand out daps, causing bias

[2:01:55] Eliminator_V: If someone gets a charge, then you change it to be worse, do they get a felony?
[2:01:56] Artsii1994: My streamer got punished for something he didn't do why can't he be hc
[2:01:59] crazyraisins13: moon2HUH  Give me the daps sir

[2:10:02] knowlightnofear: The idea of streamers telling their chatters to RELAX is like saying stop being invested in the show. As watchers we have our heroes, our villains', our irrelevant. I completely understand that Streamers receive a barrage of opinions, and some of them are wild and out of pocket, especially chat hoppers. but shutting down alternative opinions don't make sense to me. Ignore the wild ones. Easier said then done I'm know. I hope this opinion doesn't get me banned. I enjoy watching you're content.

[3:37:49] x_Gordo: YES
[3:37:49] jollypnda: use it obviously
[3:37:50] CoherentScreams: @jollypnda basing probable cause/RS to violate a citizens rights on someone saying something that is not willing to sign a statement or testify in court seems like a no brainer to get tossed as fruit of the poison bush, but this is Los Santos so I guess it could go either way for the RP...

[3:38:47] isomonk: he was downed lmao
[3:38:49] Artsii1994: doing*
[3:39:03] 2busylookinggood: what a totally insane accusation! NotLikeThis
[3:39:09] Latertoyl: saying that just because he is in a stolen car the stolen PD gun has to be his is a massive leap of logic
[3:39:09] jollypnda: @CoherentScreams as it stand with the way possession works in LS is somewhat the reason it could go both ways, but also due to the lack on investigation done by the PD this could favor K
[3:39:15] laniatx09: Inaccurate
[3:39:16] jakesnide: why did you guys cancel Mr K court case
[3:39:16] Moobot: Thanks for subbing, logster1994! Welcome to the Saabscribers! saabH

[3:39:30] LoneSoldier021: lol

[3:40:11] layla109: Lock in!
[3:40:14] jakesnide: you’ll get plenty of W’s you should let him go
[3:40:14] jay2seam: the main argument is possession, soo with Murphy case GG?
[3:40:22] psicosmoker1979: he had the gun on him is an easy W
[3:40:27] zenyatta: very brave to assume chatters will recognize a joke

[3:40:35] Ghouliexxo: @seanlew123 congrats saabH
[3:40:36] Jibry: @seanlew123 congrats sean thats awesome
[3:40:39] isolatedk1d: statements redacted xD
[3:40:40] Latertoyl: @jay2seam big difference, Braun was GSR positive, Mr K was negative
[3:40:42] CoherentScreams: @jollypnda That was my point, they had time to do an investigation, they could put Mr K under guard, get him medical in a locked room, while they get a sworn statement or commitment to testify. If they don't get that? no search, otherwise they search
[3:40:43] seanlew123: thank you
[3:40:47] FinexLive: @zenyatta HEHE
[3:40:47] sanchosnooch: yeah it’s gunna be an L that mr K case
[3:40:49] bigg504: k might get this one cleared but sure he will have many more felony’s lol
[3:40:55] LoneSoldier021: I thought murphy's ruling is getting overturned because of JP confession
[3:40:56] layla109: @zenyatta LUL
[3:40:59] One_Mana: WHERES RAMEE’s STATEMENT?
[3:41:02] chrisestes: Difference between k and Murphy is k was gsr negative and shot so someone else had to have a gun to shoot him
[3:41:04] its_R4HUL: what is that location icon on the name
[3:41:09] thatclubdj: @jay2seam Murphy was GSR positive and had no memory. K was negative and very clearly had memory of events

[3:41:25] jay2seam: @Latertoyl agreed, but according to THIS PD....
[3:41:27] lora1969: saabDap2
[3:41:27] kagradarthereal: PD is losing this one for sure. But they will catch him on something else
[3:41:32] sanchosnooch: mr k charged without ramees statement going to be a big L
[3:41:35] jakesnide: he should let Mr K go and become his lover 😂
[3:41:38] its_R4HUL: DAP

[3:41:51] FinexLive: @nnsLUL PauseChamp
[3:41:55] jollypnda: @CoherentScreams that would boil down to what is considered reasonable when it comes to searching someone involved in a gun related crime, victim or otherwise
[3:41:58] Artsii1994: Nns i want to see
[3:42:00] buddha_hands: PauseChamp yuuuge leak incoming?

[3:42:20] jakesnide: slack can’t get fired he’s the boss
[3:42:26] 95eagles: so now you believe johnson
[3:42:26] Latertoyl: The car is not related to the gun at all though, he could have been shot while driving a stolen car and the gun still could be planted
[3:42:36] Latertoyl: just because he is in a stolen car doesnt mean the gun wasnt planted
[3:42:39] thatclubdj: @nnslul Southside head pops are all sinnceres fault right?
[3:42:39] yogibv2: nothing no punishment for jaeger…

[3:42:46] nnsLUL: @thatclubdj always are
[3:42:47] layla109: @xnuttybutterx Has she ever gotten online recently? Idk if she streams or not. Just curious
[3:42:51] ArdentCause: eat some chips
[3:42:53] CoherentScreams: @jollypnda Agreed, it would depend on how strong citizen rights are compared to anonymous testimony, the standard in american is anonmous statements are not enough to violate rights, but someone willing to swear a statement? That can be used.
[3:42:57] thatclubdj: @nnslul knew it
[3:43:03] buddha_hands: yeah that's what they said in court, or at least one of them did.. I think they gave conflicting statements on that topic lol
[3:43:14] seanlew123: lol
[3:43:20] jasonquinn2022: if mrk Brings in Yeager would’ve crazy

[3:43:34] FinexLive: OMEGALAUGHING
[3:43:35] Lepaca: already broke it LUL
[3:43:36] focustft: @layla109 she was streaming today or yesterday
[3:43:38] Gen_Eh: Barry states yaeger was behind held up
[3:43:38] xnuttybutterx: @layla109 she does but she has made amends with K
[3:43:42] nox503: mehdiLAUGH
[3:43:43] dj93_: Barry said he was there
[3:43:44] yogibv2: @kayc_luv so does Mary’s
[3:43:46] talamah: classic list overflow
[3:43:53] FinexLive: ThisIsFine testing on production
[3:43:54] sanchosnooch: can’t be providing any more evidence at this point that’s wild
[3:43:57] buddha_hands: broken already smdh did sinncere make this feature or what
[3:44:06] layla109: @xnuttybutterx Really? Hoe?
[3:44:09] Latertoyl: @laniatx09 they cant argue Johnson is unreliable because he was heavily involved in the original investigation so that would taint the basis of the entire arrest by arguing him being unreliable
[3:44:10] layla109: Thanks chat.
[3:44:15] layla109: How*
[3:44:17] Maza_Manny: Yaegar instead of yeager ICANT

[3:44:55] xnuttybutterx: @layla109 ya she even bought him car through Yeager
[3:45:02] jay2seam: @Ssaab Yaeger's profile "SNA swab" vs DNA
[3:45:02] Gen_Eh: Medical report??
[3:45:06] yogibv2: claimed? the medical report no?
[3:45:07] sanchosnooch: so you fucked
[3:45:08] buddha_hands: it would be amazing if somebody somewhere was actually tracking every single crime he commits lmao @lilisongss
[3:45:10] haydenhw: wait who did shoot Mr K?
[3:45:14] kagradarthereal: yeah they're a not gonna testify imba L
[3:45:16] isomonk: no medical report, zero investigation
[3:45:17] chrisestes: @lilisongss k actually was the victim though he was the only person shot on scene
[3:45:21] sanchosnooch: beyond reasonable doubt… there is defo reasonable doubt here
[3:45:30] marizeus: not sure anyone knows who shot him
[3:45:30] Emeralblade: "so he must have shot himself" - PD
[3:45:37] isolatedk1d: he was also gsr negative right
[3:45:38] KooterNoodle: so you can get a W

[3:45:48] dj93_: also Barry says in his statement yager was there
[3:45:56] Maza_Manny: Johnson on the PD side right? Clueless
[3:45:57] Latertoyl: the fact he was shot but is gsr negative also raises doubt. Somebody else on scene had to fire a weapon
[3:46:06] kagradarthereal: oh boy slacks is in for a rude awakening
[3:46:08] Jibry: damn right mhm
[3:46:09] yogibv2: slacks lied to Johnson tbf
[3:46:11] stellarnaut: He wasn't shot ReallyMad using your eyes to chase the W Kappa
[3:46:14] Huduu: Yeah Johnson is deffo going to do the right thing here
[3:46:18] Bill_Collector: Can someone explain by the judge of the case and a witness are building a case together?
[3:46:20] VexV1: @Latertoyl theyre arguin mr k possession not who shot a gun
[3:46:21] CoherentScreams: @chrisestes illegal search victim and lack of RP victim, it was a sadge scene
[3:46:26] funnkinn: this court case is honestly gonna be a crazy one
[3:46:28] thatclubdj: Yeah, Johnson Def gonna be on PD side
[3:46:34] Tylerfosho: @haydenhw I forgot who it was but whoever was in the passenger seat of marys car
[3:46:34] laniatx09: Johnson integrity testifying
[3:46:38] sanchosnooch: johnson won’t give evidence no way
[3:46:40] Jaster_Reylu: he was shot, and only him and rammee were gsr tested, the other 6 on scene who were let go... i think that was the only proof the IT gave u to use at the time
[3:46:43] layla109: @xnuttybutterx Wowee. Thanks for the update.
[3:46:43] Thesamot: statement are not admissible no? can’t question a statement
[3:46:46] yogibv2: gsr negative
[3:46:46] Latertoyl: @VexV1 But Mr K is claiming that the gun was planted after he was shot
[3:46:47] joefr33: gsr negative tho no?
[3:46:49] Gen_Eh: He was GSR negative before being searched though?
[3:46:50] fishnchips333: dont die on this mountain bud, PD fucked that whole thing up
[3:46:51] Hero_g: classic
[3:46:56] isomonk: the shooter is the guy that got shot and was gsr negative
[3:46:58] fatbuck: GSR before CPR Leo am I right
[3:46:58] Damnitben: will Johnson’s statement just get negated by him being fired?
[3:47:00] Latertoyl: @VexV1 So him being GSR negative raises doubt
[3:47:00] m1tchole: Either way, content tomorrow is gonna be s tier
[3:47:04] davidayotte: I was watching Kylie when this all happened… it’s amazing now this is happening pog
[3:47:14] DickyBird1912: the gsr test was negative so the search was illegal as you know he wasnt the shooter tho.
[3:47:14] MexiBrent: @Hero_g classic
[3:47:15] lookingfornothinghere: still a legal search or else Gang vs Gang means the losers will never be searched
[3:47:15] VexV1: @Latertoyl how does that raise doubt on possession
[3:47:18] lilisongss: pd arrested mt fav streamer you did it wrong
[3:47:18] x_Gordo: Is Ramee Ks lawyer or is he a witness for this case?
[3:47:20] laniatx09: Yikes
[3:47:20] sanchosnooch: @damnitben I mean they can argue it lacks credibility
[3:47:21] CoherentScreams: can a case get dropped due to lack of proper investigation? Is that a thing?
[3:47:23] bigg504: Saab said it was illegal that’s why he let k walk and put it in investigation
[3:47:24] xnuttybutterx: It's RP guys even if PD takes L it's always great RP with slacks and K
[3:47:29] chrisestes: You can't justify searching the guy who is shot by saying you're looking for the shooter though
[3:47:31] marizeus: 100 % the pd did what they had to do. unfortunitly the coin landed on a side. the other side will be not faced. so at the end THIS IS GOOD RP
[3:47:32] Kiester_Felterbutts: https://clips.twitch.tv/OddDoubtfulKumquatDxAbomb-1HdcmG6t4YdBLS2C
[3:47:33] Jaster_Reylu: @x_Gordo hes a witness, sioban is lawyer
[3:47:41] Th3Sm0GG: is bary statement on scene an rs or pc for the search ? knowing that he provided a statement then dipped from the scene ?
[3:47:46] sanchosnooch: yeah slacks is a 🐐
[3:47:50] buddha_hands: @CoherentScreams it's a thing for sure but he possessed the gun, why would they drop it lol the only thing that could rly clear him is the amount of time it took to respond
[3:47:51] fishnchips333: @lookingfornothinghere not at all gsr means they were an active part of it not thhat they won or lost
[3:47:53] Alekdk1: Alekdk1 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months, currently on a 3 month streak! 
[3:47:56] sanchosnooch: k got this tho I feel
[3:47:58] jollypnda: @CoherentScreams i mean not really, unless the pd decides to drop out of it
[3:48:04] Latertoyl: @VexV1 the entire case is going to come down to Mr K convincing the judge it was planted. Him being shot down and not having fired a weapon will help his case that it was planted after he was shot down
[3:48:16] stellarnaut: @isomonk Mr K is not accused of being the shooter he was investigated for his involvement in the shooting, that's why he got a possession charge and not a violent felony charge
[3:48:19] Thesamot: with that logic tamers should have been in the report aswell?
[3:48:27] thatclubdj: K and Siobhan gonna want her there cause she put out the warrant no?
[3:48:27] kagradarthereal: would be funny for when he loses he starts dating Mr. K to cope kekw
[3:48:35] marizeus: can the pd see if its planted like the murphy case?
[3:48:42] MexiBrent: thats how it is IRL
[3:48:42] LoneSoldier021: That's what people do in real life, its a personal statement
[3:48:44] buddha_hands: how long it took for PD to be on scene seems like a huge thing here
[3:48:47] sanchosnooch: the day before court there’s no chance fam
[3:48:51] dume5330: lol
[3:48:55] isomonk: @stellarnaut slacks said he was searched because they were looking for the shooter
[3:48:59] jollypnda: i mean its not under oath so it wont carry as much weight
[3:49:00] fishnchips333: @buddha_hands route leading to them finding the gun was tainted. real court they would throw it out
[3:49:01] KoppaVRP: It was 100% a legal search, it was just poor scene control to gather the full story. The fact he was GSR negative but was shot should of raised Primary on scenes awareness that there was another shooter in the area. But it was also one of the first cases of gun play since the start of 4.0 so it will just come with time
[3:49:02] lookingfornothinghere: because you know what to ask
[3:49:02] layla109: work smarter nto harder slacks. XD
[3:49:04] S_M_O_K_3__: saabWave saabWave saabWave
[3:49:06] Thesamot: victims should write their own report no?
[3:49:10] Syn1285: lenny dead
[3:49:11] Th3Sm0GG: maybe a witness signature on a statement ?
[3:49:12] BurningFlag: Because they need someone to ask the questions KEKW
[3:49:16] arsey007: The way in is the car. If its proven in court that MR K lies about the car then his statement on the gun being planted becomes inadmissable.
[3:49:16] Maza_Manny: Less paperwork PagBounce
[3:49:17] LoneSoldier021: You write your report but if they want to provide a statement they should be writing it down
[3:49:17] marizeus: yeah i would too @Ssaab
[3:49:19] Maza_Manny: PagMan
[3:49:19] davidayotte: it only makes sense
[3:49:31] DickyBird1912: @isomonk theyd done a gsr test and it was negative before the search
[3:49:39] MexiBrent: then its on them if anything is wrong as well
[3:49:39] dianamaki: witness will write what they had for breakfast and the weather that day lol)
[3:49:41] stellarnaut: @isomonk yes they were looking for the shooter that is a investigation, he was not charged as being the shooter
[3:49:45] Pheyerus: @koppavrp essaying. wrong
[3:49:45] Maza_Manny: Handing the paperwork off to other people OMEGALAUGHING
[3:49:46] buddha_hands: brian always did that lol
[3:49:53] xnuttybutterx: K does like 75% of the crime in city they will get him sooner or later
[3:49:56] going_supernova: cops IRL have people write their own statements
[3:50:03] haydenhw: couldnt their statement just be garbage though?
[3:50:04] buddha_hands: but he's right about not knowing what details are important to include
[3:50:19] LoneSoldier021: And if it's in their own words, you can question them on it and try to find the gaps but if a cop is taking the statement and there's gaps in it, couldn't they be the reason?
[3:50:23] notdone2: Each cop carry a book listing all the people who gave PD info. Hmmm
[3:50:28] Thesamot: cops writing down a witness statement would seem as if the cop is coaching a witness to get the charge no?
[3:50:32] isomonk: @stellarnaut yeah so what is the logic in searching the guy that was shot and GSR negative, at that point how do you suspect him being the shooter ?
[3:50:36] DanLGG: yea most civilians dont know what is relevant or what is important
[3:50:44] buddha_hands: longer than that a lot of times too
[3:50:56] xnuttybutterx: Statement isn't the same if not given under oath
[3:50:58] BigglesVII: @Thesamot Thats normal in RL
[3:51:03] BorninRainbows: BorninRainbows subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 55 months! 
[3:51:10] TheKnight_Shift: a statement should be taken by the officer and it should be verbatim for what the witness has said. a statement written by the witness or victim will not be able to be used in court
[3:51:11] DanLGG: The reason K was searched is is only because someone called in 911 saying the man in the car has a gun
[3:51:12] VexV1: @stellarnaut witness statement after the gsr test stated he had a gun, its pretty cut and dry why he was searched
[3:51:14] stellarnaut: @isomonk because PD needs to investigate if the shooting was an attack or a gang related shooting
[3:51:21] buddha_hands: gotta be careful about telling civilians that too cuz it can come off like "do my job for me" or "I dont have time to help you" lol
[3:51:35] Cultivated: @DanLGG a person on scene said that as well
[3:51:36] Maza_Manny: Chase that W Leo ReallyMad
[3:51:41] isomonk: @stellarnaut yeah that's correct but it's not what Slacks said
[3:51:45] StreamElements: Make sure to check out my Youtube Channel!  saabHype -  https://cutt.ly/SaabYT
[3:51:51] CoherentScreams: @isomonk someone called up and said he had a gun, but would not testify to that in court, so mighty sus, going of that logic, the PD could just have an off duty cop call up anytime the find a crim and say they have a gun on them, and thus instant rights to search everyone, just get a new sim card for each shooting and make up a new name each time ez clap
[3:51:55] its_R4HUL: +1

[3:52:18] ItsAHazardLife: @CoherentScreams 100% agree
[3:52:21] ItsAHazardLife: 100% agree with that statement.
[3:52:22] layla109: Yo PD needs a spa day. All of these reflexive swings to the face LUL
[3:52:38] RoninSisu: LUL LUL LUL LUL
[3:52:38] Latertoyl: People also need to remember that all Mr K's lawyer needs to do is raise reasonable doubt, there seem to be enough potential holes for a good lawyer to raise that doubt
[3:52:45] Damnitben: carmines PC blew up ooc
[3:52:45] buddha_hands: @CoherentScreams that would be true but it was in a context of many, many examples of the same people fucking with the same victims lol (until they weren't the victims)
[3:52:49] haydenhw: LOL
[3:52:53] xnuttybutterx: Johnson was so fun to watch as cop
[3:52:54] Artsii1994: AAAA
[3:52:58] davidayotte: think Angel took that case lol
[3:52:59] LoneSoldier021: The character play Oliver, is he the Yesman? They sound similar
[3:53:00] Bubbasage: I heard Carmines actual PC melted from the southside headaches
[3:53:04] bigbadwu: way more than that LUL
[3:53:07] Jaster_Reylu: @Latertoyl see murphy case
[3:53:16] stellarnaut: @vexv1 regardless of witness testimony a officer should've at least frisked everyone at the scene imo. It's the only way to exonerate innocent people
[3:53:18] arsey007: @Latertoyl The car is the problem area for Mr K.
[3:53:20] buddha_hands: LMAO
[3:53:35] buddha_hands: whoa whoa now that's just excessive
[3:53:38] Latertoyl: @Jaster_Reylu The main piece of evidence against Murphy was that fact Murphy was GSR positive
[3:53:39] VexV1: @stellarnaut everyone agrees with that, thats not what we are arguing
[3:53:48] FinexLive: OMEGALAUGHING
[3:53:51] Th3Sm0GG: geniune question, are witness statements enough for someone to be searched ?
[3:54:03] bigbadwu: Clap
[3:54:08] bigg504: 20,000
[3:54:10] Alekdk1: @bubbasage yep vinnys House actually caused real damage lmao
[3:54:12] bigbadwu: lmao
[3:54:15] thatclubdj: @jaster_reylu Murphy is completely different. Murphy was drunk and also lost his memory... oh yeah and GSR positive.
[3:54:15] bigg504: lol
[3:54:17] WildWillie419: Oliver is the best, most level-headed lawyer
[3:54:19] stellarnaut: @vexv1 I'm not arguing lol CAUGHT
[3:54:20] bigbadwu: where the fuck has carmine been?
[3:54:21] Maza_Manny: monkaOMEGA
[3:54:23] CoherentScreams: @buddha_hands perhaps but that is the problem with precedence, can't have it both ways, if someone calling up is enough to search, then it is enough. If they have to be willing to swear in open court or to a statement, that raises the bar. Does Los Santos want a city with strong civil rights or weak ones? Or let the PD do whatever it wants whenener it wants, can't have it both ways
[3:54:28] Maza_Manny: @bigbadwu cpu died
[3:54:31] talamah: LookUp
[3:54:40] buddha_hands: welp gotta line up a bunch of witnesses I guess lmao
[3:54:41] kingofthebeats: @buddha_hands holy shit, a fucking essay
[3:54:44] Maza_Manny: should be getting it fixed soon
[3:54:44] thatclubdj: Uikes.Yikes.. my PC gonna die from that message
[3:54:57] bigg504: it was a accident like you just punched him a ACCIDENT
[3:55:10] Ghouliexxo: muniLookUp
[3:55:11] Rockshock: It was an acitve shooting scene. imo. Everyone at a crime scene like that should be searched to determine things despite being down or not.
[3:55:16] Maza_Manny: WRONG ReallyMad you guys are corrupt
[3:55:19] thatclubdj: @produxi K offered to buy him a new card if he needs it
[3:55:22] Leffyxx: your missing your court case
[3:55:25] jollypnda: @CoherentScreams statements under oath are always seen as higher than statements made in a regular police setting
[3:55:26] strawberryraye: ????
[3:55:28] Latertoyl: The fact that the witness tried to recant their statement at some point raises the possibility of them showing up in court and recanting on the stand to help the defense
[3:55:38] Maza_Manny: Vinny shithole house PepeLaugh
[3:55:51] chrisestes: @rockshock the police need reason to search and being the victim of a crime is not a valid one
[3:56:06] Pheyerus: Valuin his life to the equivalent of 1-2 hours workin at g6 damn
[3:56:12] CuBanMumzy: he sounds like he is in court
[3:56:17] Rockshock: it was a crime scene with different views on what happened. They didnt know who did what or how. Searching everyone is valid in that situation.
[3:56:21] Maza_Manny: Shrug Give him your house
[3:56:23] buddha_hands: @CoherentScreams nothing's ever that black+white though.. normally someone claiming something ISNT enough to do anything but maybe look at it, but when you add in like 10 prior attacks, it changes things
[3:56:27] davidayotte: this might be better then the k/Marty case lol
[3:56:29] CoherentScreams: @Rockshock but they were the victim and were GSR negative, should that have counted? Or anyone withing 100 feet of a shooting can be searched? Gotta draw the line somewhere?
[3:56:30] strawberryraye: lolll
[3:56:32] MsHollyyy: oop
[3:56:32] cjohno20: grime makes 4k an hour KEKW
[3:56:34] stellarnaut: @produxi LOL
[3:56:40] PaulieBeanbags23: 5k is so unreasonable it's almost laughable
[3:56:46] ykicka: $1 imo
[3:56:51] stellarnaut: @produxi EZ easy solution
[3:56:53] q3aserver: 12k is a joke too
[3:56:55] thatclubdj: Chat.. did Nekoda tell Slacks about Cranes new hires for Department of Corrections?
[3:56:57] chrisestes: @rockshock it was a shots fired call the one person you know isn't responsible is the guy who was shot
[3:57:01] q3aserver: my man was crippled for weeks
[3:57:04] VexV1: @thatclubdj yup
[3:57:06] CuBanMumzy: this opens pandora's box
[3:57:14] jollypnda: @buddha_hands the issue is there are no reports on k or ramee previously attack MAry so that logic does apply in this case
[3:57:16] lora1969: saabKEK
[3:57:23] ChirithyChi: even cornwood is broke now, things are bad
[3:57:33] Rockshock: @Rockshock Of course theres a limit. But they were right in the middle of the scene. Clearly invovled one way or another. Imo. that's grounds for searching everyone when it comes to an consuing scene like that involving shooting.
[3:57:34] Maza_Manny: Weirdge penny pinching
[3:57:37] thatclubdj: @chrisestes it's the GSR negative guy, being shot doesn't make him innocent
[3:57:37] jollypnda: doent
[3:57:39] VexV1: @ChirithyChi denzel isnt broke but hes been suspended KEKW
[3:57:49] stellarnaut: Just deputize Snr buns employees and disband the PD Shrug
[3:57:50] davidayotte: noooo i wana see this case
[3:57:52] Rockshock: confusing*
[3:57:59] Pheyerus: half way of 50 is 25. who’s not meeting halfway here
[3:58:02] talamah: classic
[3:58:04] Maza_Manny: classic
[3:58:07] buddha_hands: @jollypnda there were lots of (at least verbal/911 reports of it for sure.. I remember that much, but don't know about actual police reports
[3:58:14] Jibry: @chrisestes theres potential the weapon  cant still be on scene. Looking for that weapon in a shot s fired scene. But it depends on how the justice system wants it to be carried out
[3:58:20] Maza_Manny: out of PD by hour 4? PagMan
[3:58:23] Jaster_Reylu: did he call crane yet
[3:58:28] WildWillie419: Send a PPO on a food run saabKEK

[4:30:42] Djfsappy: its super funny how none of the captains even understand(in character) what cletus wants
[4:30:42] cosaka: Is he problem that he talked in front of people about it or that he went to the Mayor over her head.
[4:30:45] pacific_kool3r: mehdi is too good at rp to just be a cop lol LUL
[4:31:03] Oreo3295: being a cpt seems fun lol
[4:31:09] Sneakystinkyratman: Is there a big list anywhere of all the gta rp streamers
[4:31:15] Ragestrike: i think slacks need to have a conversation with cornwood nekoda and the mayor together before he forms his opinion because i dont think he understand the plan for sheriff dept at all.
[4:31:18] Sneakystinkyratman: on nopixel
[4:31:21] MrBASins: hello Ssaab, how's slacks today? Did they release the new PD Vehicles yet
[4:31:24] SweeneysWeenies: @Sneakystinkyratman theres a wiki i think

[4:31:38] Sneakystinkyratman: thank you
[4:31:38] Wintyer2: Does the Character Slacks know a captain goign to be called before the council to justify the the budget cause that how they control the pd now
[4:31:41] krisholborn2024: recruiting isn’t the  issue it’s the retention
[4:31:45] rclemon_: @speeddevilx he clout chased lirik frfr
[4:31:49] TheOGWombat: we need Den Zel
[4:31:51] KoppaVRP: Look if you need more officers i volunteer  KappaRoss  i'll send you my resume

[4:32:04] FinexLive: @Sneakystinkyratman frfr
[4:32:05] 0zarruu: yeah I think there is miscommunication going on with what Cornwood is actually trying to do
[4:32:07] buddha_hands: SOPs are for standard situations right.. if it happens occasionally it's not so bad
[4:32:08] Speeddevilx: @rclemon_ lol makes sense *takes notes*
[4:32:15] PsychoJoker: @Djfsappy he wants the sandy shores sheriffs office operational so its easier to get shit done up there and paleto if possible and it being all under one roof of LSPD. He doesnt even care about a sheriff being elected right now
[4:32:28] Ragestrike: sheriff dept is support to maintain retention and give you operating bases in paleto and sandy,  and has nothing to do with getting a sheriff. or electing cornwood as sheriff but people dont understand that.
[4:32:28] lilisongss: i mean cops have broken cars sops  to never shoot and end rp so they getting rammed 50 car swapped everday would you want be a cop on the server lol
[4:32:39] Rockshock: That's all IC though. Slacks dont know that.
[4:32:40] chrisestes: If Mr k's mask wasn't taken off they would've opened fire for sure
[4:32:44] RonJon: I think it's different since it's an officer
[4:32:55] SharkzGG_: to be fair chat, when it started it was a "open the BSCO" and it became "open the buildings for use" later and everyone has been confused since
[4:33:03] pacific_kool3r: most of the legislations seem like big fuck yous to people
[4:33:03] jay2seam: this actually worked in PD's favor LUL Peanut's warrant was served.. K's will be after court
[4:33:04] lookingfornothinghere: you allow it once it will always work we ahve seen this play out already in 3.0
[4:33:14] Wallsh_: Girl please
[4:33:21] Eddie1225: damn bruh
[4:33:22] Eddie1225: im back
[4:33:25] Djfsappy: @PsychoJoker right i know that, but all the captiains are acting like he wants to split off, he is gonna end up getting suspended for them not understanding that.
[4:33:26] soiledmypantss: how does his warrant work tomorrow when he shows up for his court case?

[4:33:35] ShadowedSeraphim: but you're not only trading hostages.. you keeping a PD Glock and equipment off the street. You are prioritizing life over the arrest
[4:33:39] MonsterFuel: Chatting
[4:33:43] Paxipher: hmm
[4:33:43] rclemon_: she was talking and shit about you
[4:33:43] imationRip: LOL before or after he gets a dap?
[4:33:46] WildWillie419: LSPD would let civs die before trading a person  in custody?
[4:33:47] jinnytolls: Given the situation, I think Ruby made a fair call
[4:33:54] TheOGWombat: doesn’t it sometimes stop from getting officers killed elsewhere as a diversion?
[4:33:55] Reanna_x: KEKWTF
[4:34:04] Wallsh_: Ruby made the 100% right call
[4:34:07] skedaddelr: there was a lot of traffic in the area?
[4:34:23] WildWillie419: Gotcha gotcha
[4:34:23] chrisestes: @lookingfornothinghere only works if a cop is left alone or walks off alone which is what ruby said
[4:34:27] Xethra: Cheever's character is by the book, its very in character for her to bring up SOPs
[4:34:31] Conner293: They took his mask off

[4:34:39] Mandrenn: ruby made the right call.
[4:34:40] kylemacs: too bad she’s never out there TO MAKE A CALL
[4:34:42] MsHollyyy: @Wallsh_ Agreed. And it wasn't just the one they took but 3 for 1, so I think it was worth lol
[4:34:52] RonJon: It's also situational. If it was a random hostage it migh tbe different
[4:34:56] ShadowedSeraphim: I think the real issue was that the officers got split up so there was no back up for the one captured
[4:34:56] TheOGWombat: prolonged rp. exactly
[4:34:57] zeroxschneider: Agree'd cause the priority is the officer but leaves room for things to continue with a consequence still in play
[4:34:58] lookingfornothinghere: thats all nice until it happens every chase hey let me get my boy back for random person i have
[4:34:58] lilisongss: swaping a 05 should never be a norm oin rp or every day now it be cop held up let my guy go \

[4:58:55] Diamondman121314: @Eddie1225 I agree 100%, but I'm pretty sure that it was called off, not because of the sbs, but because brian knight wasn't going to support it, while I was watching from his pov

[5:05:40] TimmayHS: Donald Bush the 23rd. I wonder if Donald Bush the 24th exists yet though
[5:05:42] Toastedgamer03: @catfish_quackenbush so he probably would just do samuel l jackson and some sod until ff7 rebirth comes out and then get addicted to ff7 rebirth KEKW
[5:05:43] catfish_quackenbush: @Toastedgamer03 yea i was just thinking he isnt really into his other toons, so he would prob go back to SoD or yea FF7

[5:09:25] the_oracie: "your honor it was bussin bussin no kizzy, frfr. the suspect said skibbidi toilet kai cenat challenge and we had to shoot em"
[5:09:29] my69thaccount: the PD is so boring without Cornwood
[5:09:31] WildWillie419: Cornwood redemption arc while he’s fired
[5:09:33] Rockshock: @Djfsappy There is no 1 lifer IC. This all happend in real life aka IC for these characters. Like i've said SBS doesnt remove you from punishment
[5:09:34] aniquilattion: @whattheinterrobang that’s not what an officer does
[5:09:34] Eddie1225: i'll say it again
[5:09:34] DevilDogTash: gotta make sure
[5:09:35] MoistMouthMags: aye...all imma say is...every officer involved shooting ive seen from IRL, its mag dump city
[5:09:36] FuZroK: the point of a liver character is to get killed and get someone murder charges LUL
[5:09:38] catfish_quackenbush: so funny Esfand was telling his chat "there is no way cornwood gets fired for a 1 lifer"
[5:09:39] Eddie1225: SBS ISNT AN EXCUSE
[5:09:40] VonDungus: gotta escalate to deescalate esfandHowdy
[5:09:41] xiouq1: wasnt cornwoods statement that he gave him 1 more shot for sam baas ICANT
[5:09:43] Luthercorpz: The whole thing was a one lifer fun fest thing all in that days context.  Looks bad after 1 dap is w/e
[5:09:43] Eddie1225: KEKL
[5:09:45] brvtyy: 1/3 of the pd is playing law and order, 1/3 is playing reno 911, and 1/3 is playing game of thrones
[5:09:47] thermalnemisis1: This kinda looking like conspiracy to commit murder here
[5:09:47] Sneakystinkyratman: Zombie land double tap he was a crackzombie

[5:09:58] RandomShungiteCD: OMEGALUL how do you justify IC a onelifer
[5:10:00] slomojosh: ITS ROLEPLAY
[5:10:01] MaSTerSOra701: why not dap all the officers involved since no ne seemed to do anything to fix the issue @Ssaab ?
[5:10:01] itWyrm: Dapped for SBS SAJ
[5:10:01] GreenMonk: @brvtyy KEKW
[5:10:02] psylongti: 6 officer shooting and 5 bullets is fucking tragic
[5:10:03] SarahFlare: but there were only 5 holes
[5:10:03] Djfsappy: @srejok yeah they all say "its rp, dont take it so serious", then when people have fun with it, they ruin the viewing experience by taking it to serious
[5:10:04] just_james69: Yeah I was saying it's mad how people think it's okay because it's a one lifer
[5:10:05] ChiefinIt: Chating just SBS bro
[5:10:06] Jaster_Reylu: if Kit left something out of report.... is that a - integrity, like johnson?
[5:10:07] Biggysnipes: meh it aint much of an issue
[5:10:08] rickybegas: Isn't there a risk of having statements influenced by eachother if they're all made on the same page?
[5:10:08] BenjaminNP: what is a 1 lifer?
[5:10:10] DevilDogTash: need to make sure
[5:10:11] smalllittleisaac: Cornwood is nothing without been a cop LUL
[5:10:11] enfranchise_: One extra bullet though?

[5:10:13] Artsii1994: @scaredsquid small brain syndrom
[5:10:14] DESHAWNTE: lol
[5:10:14] Vexamas: Chat, every character *should* be viewed as a one lifer
[5:10:14] judge_hat: from the reports makes it seem like more than 1 mag
[5:10:15] WHATtheINTERROBANG: He stabbed his partner !
[5:10:15] manwod_77: the extra bullet was for baas
[5:10:15] ShinJiHun: same take as Brian Knight
[5:10:19] cjohno20: he continued after the threat was neutralized, and the man died. he's lucky he's not being charged with murder
[5:10:20] azncheesy: EZ sounds cool as hell though
[5:10:20] AnonymousOld: *2 mags and one bullet
[5:10:20] 95eagles: its funny af tho
[5:10:21] Agony099: hey zombieland taught us to double tap
[5:10:21] jollypnda: @Eddie1225 it apparently is only allowed for specific people lol
[5:10:21] xiouq1: @RandomShungiteCD your honor, weeeeell he was suicidal
[5:10:22] Wilsyn: i mean its important to balance rp with fun tho right?
[5:10:23] gblair09: @jaster_reylu lmfao TRUE
[5:10:24] TimmayHS: The EMS said he missed all of his shots
[5:10:24] Jibry: SBS doesn't deter consequences.
[5:10:24] SumDee_LumDee: you need to explain this to Cornwood,m
[5:10:28] emery_steele: tbf alot of times it looks like the person goes down, then they get back up. guns are weak af
[5:10:29] bigbadwu: nah still gottta make sure
[5:10:29] boozncruise: he was still crawling after the mag dump he was on pcp

[5:10:33] FuZroK: Officers f'ed around and about to find out lol
[5:10:34] DickyBird1912: anchor shot is 100% a major issue
[5:10:35] moomanji: Honestly for Esfands sake he may need to get the message the hard way IC and OOC
[5:10:35] layla109: It's the precedent and example set
[5:10:35] Eddie1225: next time crims robb something
[5:10:36] WHATtheINTERROBANG: Hell YES
[5:10:36] mad0monk: It's for sure an issue, but he didn't lie about it
[5:10:36] KappaManJason: esfand thinks it wasnt a issue
[5:10:37] Eddie1225: jsut shoot
[5:10:37] SarahFlare: Hey, at least it wasn't an Acorn
[5:10:37] ITZxJeff: and most of them didnt know it was an SBS situation

[5:10:40] GreenMonk: i mean he mag dumped him, then mag dumped him on the ground, then put one more, i dont think its just the one
[5:10:40] layla109: pretty clear cut.
[5:10:40] DevilDogTash: if that person attacked a cop you need to make sure they are down
[5:10:41] jersey_jesus: If he had a revolver he'd be out of bullets Kappa
[5:10:41] thegr8on316: He shot as many as needed....
[5:10:41] skympii: yeah but they were just having a laugh  there
[5:10:43] MaddPursuit: Because Everybody knew it was a joke
[5:10:44] IvyOlive: you don’t need to explain it to chat
[5:10:44] Eddie1225: i bet chat wont say the same shit they are now
[5:10:44] Mystikalrush: Your missing the visual context though. On paper it doesnt sound good, but if you want to break the meta there are clips.
[5:10:44] Eddie1225: OMEGALAUGHING
[5:10:45] WHATtheINTERROBANG: Slacks aint from Texas
[5:10:45] Pattymelt1250: What does 1 additional bullet change?

[5:10:54] blahder: Was good rp
[5:10:56] dholdren12: i dont see it being 5 daps worthy
[5:10:58] MaddPursuit: just dap and move on

[5:10:59] puhctek: 25 bullets lol
[5:11:01] ShinJiHun: Chatting watch the meta
[5:11:04] catfish_quackenbush: I think esfand is thinking back early 3.0 days with Koil and Andrews and Trooper shit. It was much more laxed then.
[5:11:05] slomojosh: @eddie1225 that’s exactly why they don’t do that because you can understand the nuance
[5:11:05] arcticOP: he added his bullets with johnsons so 12 + 12 and then 1 for sam baas :)
[5:11:06] Paxipher: @fishnchips333 lol
[5:11:07] MaddPursuit: Aziz EZ

[5:11:09] Abduleon_: OMEGALUL local
[5:11:09] Scorge_: i dont say much here but PD has been super aggressive lately, ramming at any speed and making bad calls... where is the old PD ?
[5:11:11] MillerThyme: <Message was DAP'd>

[5:11:12] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: esfandCOPS esfandCOPS esfandCOPS esfandCOPS esfandCOPS esfandCOPS
[5:11:17] Skyler56: cornwood dose need to reel it in a bit
[5:11:18] 0zarruu: 5 daps seems excessive though no?
[5:11:19] mrchickensworth: If cornwood was closes you can't say what he seen with his eyes.
[5:11:20] blahder: Him and Andrew's had been arguing earlier, then Andrew's got stabed and he lost it.
[5:11:20] DanLGG: it’s not like he shot him 30 times. it was only 2 mags +1 for Baas.
[5:11:20] laniatx09: Just warning for the extra bullet
[5:11:21] McKibbo: wait what does cornwoods statement say
[5:11:21] BDubs7769: He dumped 2 mags and an extra round for good measure. SBS gone too far.
[5:11:23] Pattymelt1250: @more_parrots How so? Idrk what the consequence is
[5:11:23] davidf4735: @puhctek WIth only 5 hitting and not even sure the 5 are cornwords lol

[5:11:31] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: <Message was DAP’d>
[5:11:31] SmugPls: it should be 1 dap, for 1 for sam baas

[5:11:32] fishnchips333: @MillerThyme hahaha
[5:11:35] jollypnda: @Eddie1225 exactly how many times in 3.0 did cops show up to little Seoul over CG sbs
[5:11:36] PacGamer: I think it's pretty easy to understand at least as a casual lurker. There's 2 different kinds of RP happening and they're conflicting with each other. True to life RP vs parody RP.
[5:11:37] thegr8on316: What sop did he violate, guess stabbing cops is cool... they wont shoot you, who cares how many rounds it took
[5:11:37] WHATtheINTERROBANG: Cornwood didn't mean to ram. It was by the looks but he didn't mean to

[5:11:45] Luthercorpz: All Corn's daps fell off anyawys he's at zero. It's w/e
[5:11:46] Djfsappy: @Rockshock sure, but was it not fun to watch, did they not do it for enjoyment of chat? does not every steamer say " its rp, dont take it sso serious", then take the stuff that is sbs and take it super sserious?

[5:19:35] MrBASins: to be fair the LSPD is losing its grip on Los Santos that the true and know lspd is have financial problems, why the criminal's are having a hey day and walking all over the LSPD. something needs give and show the criminals the LSPD is not playing. if your to soft then they will take you for a ride and laugh at you in the end.  you and the others need to do something, slacks
[5:19:36] Toastedgamer03: @Toastbane he did grind already but maybe something that can top stripper cornwood could happen

[5:20:14] SarahFlare: Do you think the increase of crim mechanics unlocked and the lack of police progression is causing a lot of internal/cop drama?
[5:20:16] SharkzGG_: WIth how many hours Esfand has been playing non stop, a suspension will do good for him IRL
[5:20:16] Dregg0: yea it suck’s that it was dean’s one lifer and Cornwood just wanted to give him good RP lol
[5:20:17] Hibob222: uhsCozy

[5:20:24] JesusGVG: yooo saab want me to link you some Ultraboosts?
[5:20:27] MaddPursuit: mhm mhm
[5:20:30] catfish_quackenbush: @KMGP_Outlaw exactly, pd owes him like 130k min, then mcnulty owes him 100k, and then a couple other officers owe him like 10-15k
[5:20:34] Sneakystinkyratman: It would be funny to see community service RP where they have to pickup trash around the city
[5:20:38] WildWillie419: Mainly I think Cornwood is goofier than the current PD allows
[5:20:39] KMGP_Outlaw: @TheKingOfWit think?  thats a fact lol
[5:20:42] xiouq1: PD gang
[5:20:43] spaghitty: he wants to make it fun but tends to cross the line a bit. & it should be fun obviously but if everyone were to slightly cross the line then there would be major problems
[5:20:43] Skyler56: server gose to shit
[5:20:43] SharkzGG_: mhm set the tone
[5:20:47] Spartoriius: it turns into shit rp

[5:20:48] SuperSaintNick: :) no
[5:20:49] Jibry: then you get 3.0 PD of corruption
[5:20:51] Paxipher: @KMGP_Outlaw trueeeee
[5:20:52] more_parrots: more cornwoods would show up
[5:20:53] RsMadeMePhat: Cleetus runs around making everyone laugh
[5:20:54] YoshiTheDeeno: People always expect people to be perfect. Cornwood has some flaws that's what makes him funny
[5:20:58] Kunarklive: ITS A GOD DAMN SHITSHOW
[5:20:59] buddha_hands: @Wilsyn yeah - people can find fun in whatever hand they get dealt, some of which will be bad things that happen to characters.. if there never was, it'd be boring
[5:21:01] Alkemiee: is it RP or IRL feelings? lol
[5:21:02] MaSTerSOra701: NO one even respects the PD LOL
[5:21:02] 95eagles: you seem to be overcorrecting tbh
[5:21:03] CuBanMumzy: anarchy
[5:21:03] MoistMouthMags: i feel like the pendulum was swung too far the other way IMO
[5:21:05] davidayotte: I’m envious of u guys/girls that do this… imagine living another life with other people in the same situation
[5:21:06] VonDungus: a dadgum shitshow
[5:21:07] DanLGG: If you watch rp everyday for entertainment you are invested. I am invested but if something in rp upsets you. take a step back as u are to invested
[5:21:08] Hibob222: uhsCozy kinamaCozy saabComfy PeepoComfy
[5:21:08] just_james69: I love cornwood but yeah he needs to be punished unfortunately
[5:21:09] jacksmithcje: I get the Marino but the knight situation is disappointing I feel like cornwood explained it well to slacks and knight removed his comment saying he was cooked which looks bad
[5:21:10] RobialT: The police force crumbles and crims rule everything O wait thats whats happenein rn LUL
[5:21:10] jinnytolls: OOC, what kind of rules are there around SBS
[5:21:12] heftylefty_prime: Then why isn't it 1 DAP for a firing by that logic?
[5:21:13] Chichjr: Not only that the PD needs to be serious to at least start to build the department cause its not as big as it was in 3.0 right now
[5:21:14] Spartoriius: yep
[5:21:14] TheKingOfWit: @KMGP_Outlaw the math part is a fact, whether it's a part of the issue is the think part
[5:21:15] goChloro: true but I think people say that regardless
[5:21:15] luxxen1: I kind of want Cornwood to go back to his vigilante origins after being fired, like be the "hero" the city needs LUL
[5:21:16] DanLGG: We get 3.0 repeat
[5:21:18] Toastedgamer03: @catfish_quackenbush yeah cornwood is owed a lot of money that would have to get paid off very quickly after being fired KEKW
[5:21:18] jollypnda: what happens is you have cops planting bombs in auto shops lol
[5:21:19] m1tchole: PD have so much natural power to shut down RP so it's important they behave and stick to strict rules
[5:21:20] thelariat_: HUH
[5:21:21] usakobun: pd had guns we want guns
[5:21:23] Firehead94: i think part of the problem is the other "companies" in the city arent holding their employees to similar standards and so things seem skewed to viewers
[5:21:23] modooc56: then just mass hire cops if there is accountability
[5:21:23] catfish_quackenbush: @WildWillie419 yea hes still use to the early NP 3.0, when him, andrews, Koil, and Lenny would do "Trooper Shit"
[5:21:24] FuZroK: @RsMadeMePhat He can do that as a civilian
[5:21:24] uwurue: what happens when no one has fun and theres no praise.. this
[5:21:25] Athbreith: @Ssaab Are you prepared if you suspend Cornwood he takes all the Turbos from PD Cars?
[5:21:25] my69thaccount: but if it’s only Cornwood people know it’s mostly a joke
[5:21:25] lizardeyes: do not become dependent on ac
[5:21:27] Albiwar: burneChad serious RP ? no thank you, imma steal buns formula again burneSpin
[5:21:27] manwod_77: @SharkzGG_ if esfand isnt rping he will still stream 16 hours
[5:21:28] Hibob222: yup
[5:21:30] Toastbane: PD rep is terrible already though lol
[5:21:32] KMGP_Outlaw: @catfish_quackenbush brutal look haha
[5:21:34] DaltonIRL: PD does seem soft af though, how people gonna kick cars, swap 20x all this shit and you barely get permission to pit let alone anything else
[5:21:35] yellowtristan: funny how there’s so many experts in chat telling you what you’re doing wrong but couldn’t handle it themselves
[5:21:36] RsMadeMePhat: @FuZroK after this he might
[5:21:40] McKibbo: 3 captains 3 different leadership styles that all have their own faults and no one is above them evaluate what they are doing wrong and correct them
[5:21:41] RobialT: No one takes the PD seriously right now tho
[5:21:44] heftylefty_prime: Tough
[5:21:47] Pheyerus: Yuck ya
[5:21:50] itWyrm: no one takes PD seriously already LULW
[5:21:52] buddha_hands: @Firehead94 well there ARE no companies yet OMEGALAUGHING including PD
[5:21:53] RoninSisu: If so much accountability is looked into, you lose the aspect of Gaming rp though, And we lose good characters that way, right?
[5:21:53] MaddPursuit: Good officer? +all punishment, NPC officers +praise
[5:21:54] uwurue: ur dab system is bull
[5:21:57] jacksmithcje: but if he’s owed that money and it’s been four weeks he needs money during suspension tbf
[5:21:57] jollypnda: i mean you could argue theft at that point for pettyness
[5:21:58] thelariat_: the betrayal
[5:22:00] Alkemiee: chats told its just RP, but streamers are pretty serious about it all FeelsOkayMan
[5:22:01] LHaxorP: @Ssaab maybe a dumb but srs question tho Dean RP'd only 5 hits at the hospital so if they do that can it be considered mag dump if the receiving party "states it wasnt"?
[5:22:01] lizardeyes: yuk
[5:22:02] myragome: why would he help out the PD when they are just shitting on him tho?
[5:22:02] Jibry: @Toastbane when has the PD rep ever been good in RP
[5:22:03] Spartoriius: @uwurue go outside
[5:22:03] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: yes and crims need to be punished harder
[5:22:04] sourdoughcookies: @m1tchole but in the same breath because they have so much control of it there has to be an understanding for them to allow things to play out certain ways
[5:22:05] Pandrax86: that’s how it already is and always has been. sucks because the PD is turning into the fun police. crims out there full on SBS mode
[5:22:06] KappaManJason: is cornwood getting suspended
[5:22:07] KMGP_Outlaw: @TheKingOfWit fasho fasho
[5:22:10] MillerThyme: SAVEME Wrangler
[5:22:12] YoshiTheDeeno: Crims have no integrity checks pd does
[5:22:12] Djfsappy: @jollypnda not when he hasnt been paid back
[5:22:13] TheKingOfWit: I really hope he doesn't do that, it's petty and will look bad on him
[5:22:14] Hibob222: we need pd to be taken serious if people think its a joke they will be treated like a joke
[5:22:15] MaddPursuit: PD def soft
[5:22:15] Agony099: the dab system does in a way punish those that do more rather than those that arent around much
[5:22:17] icephrogg: Hell i hope esfand will play some Ali lol i miss Ali
[5:22:18] Agony099: dap*
[5:22:18] SarahFlare: it kills the rp
[5:22:20] ChirithyChi: CORNMAN JUSTICE

[5:22:22] MonsterFuel: gachiHYPER go really hard
[5:22:22] Skyler56: its not fun for anyone then
[5:22:22] usakobun: why should cornwood have the pds back when the pd don’t have his back
[5:22:23] jinnytolls: @jollypnda how is it theft, they are paid for out of his pocket without reimbursement
[5:22:23] Chaoszero_goc: chat esfand is an adult, he will be fine, let it play5 out
[5:22:24] uwurue: @spartoriius cry harder for me
[5:22:25] Hibob222: NODDERS
[5:22:26] JesusGVG: hell week LULW
[5:22:26] itWyrm: PD harder on their own than on crims ngl
[5:22:26] dholdren12: it makes for better role play
[5:22:26] DanLGG: go to any 3.0 pd YouTube video and read comments. they are 90% saying PD act like this because they don’t have any consequences
[5:22:27] MaddPursuit: They scared to shoot
[5:22:27] catfish_quackenbush: @KappaManJason if all the potential DAPs go through he will be at 10
[5:22:27] Kiester_Felterbutts: https://clips.twitch.tv/OddDoubtfulKumquatDxAbomb-1HdcmG6t4YdBLS2C

[5:22:33] magnets_: ehrport lime

[5:22:42] SharkzGG_: I think most current RP chatters just spawned in late 3.0 and got set in that kind of server mindset and don't know how a fresh city works
[5:22:42] solaris0000: thats me
[5:22:42] Rockshock: All these parasocial weirdos lol. This is extremely funny how mad people get over an character getting punished IC and brings in esfand and ooc names/persona of people.
[5:22:44] RoninSisu: you end RP
[5:22:45] thebigshabam: @Kiester_Felterbutts https://clips.twitch.tv/SincereClumsyEelSeemsGood-8XfJWI7KSobA9bjA
[5:22:47] RobialT: Aftermath, no one respects PD anyway
[5:22:47] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: preddd
[5:22:48] Reanna_x: i always say it, people want fun cops until someone they like gets fucked over by bad police work then theres no one to correct it KEKW
[5:22:49] FuZroK: @Agony099 there are only 3 officers complaining about daps. ALL the others dont care
[5:22:50] davidayotte: or when ur car breaks down and outa man power… crims can just swap Ssaab is correct
[5:22:51] DaltonIRL: Fair but I'm sure the sani and g6 workers really enjoy getting robbed 24/7
[5:22:53] lookingfornothinghere: there is a middle ground there isnt just 10 swaps and do nothing or magdump everyone there is tings inbetween
[5:22:56] jacksmithcje: I do think cornwood told slacks the knight situation very well and I know you wasn’t streaming but knight removed his cooked statement
[5:22:59] MoMoTsumi: Chats stupid....
[5:23:01] jollypnda: @Djfsappy i mean if you gift something, that doesnt mean you can come back and take it without permission, like i said it would be super petty
[5:23:01] BurningFlag: But u get the W GIGACHAD
[5:23:01] Eddie1225: new frogs really have no clue OMEGALAUGHING
[5:23:01] buddha_hands: absolutely no clue OMEGALAUGHING
[5:23:04] layla109: A lot of these folks are chat hoppers I'm guessing
[5:23:04] ncs_310: So if Cornwood reaches 10 DAPs and then this 4 previous DAPs expire, does the suspension end
[5:23:05] focustft: @Reanna_x YUP

[5:23:27] magnets_: AZIZ

[5:23:30] modooc56: OMEGALUL
[5:23:31] SuperSaintNick: monkaW
[5:23:31] Chichjr: Right now at least from what I have seen within rp and streams there is only at least 11 cops on at a time. 3.0 there was how many at a time? So right now the PD needs to be serious to begin the stepping stones for the new blood and what not
[5:23:32] Agony099: @Agony099 i mean even duncan got suspended as the guy that preaches books, but again more scenes = more dap chance
[5:23:33] SarahFlare: LUL
[5:23:33] imationRip: GET HIM!

[5:23:36] Ned15: Saab has been doing this for 6 years LUL
[5:23:37] BohLTss: its should be 6 total doing a crime including who is swapping
[5:23:37] SuperSaintNick: monkaOMEGA
[5:23:37] Rockshock: @Eddie1225 What I like to do is imagine the general NP viewer watch hardcore RP servers and think about how they'd react to it.
[5:23:37] Artsii1994: GET HIM
[5:23:39] Paxipher: Serious question: what is the argument for giving daps over having a serious conversation with an officer?
[5:23:39] Djfsappy: @jollypnda its not a gift when he has a report that details everything has done to get paiid back
[5:23:39] magnets_: ember lol
[5:23:40] RandomShungiteCD: AAAA
[5:23:41] WHATtheINTERROBANG: Why does it require so much dadgum evidence to prosecute a crim but prosecuting a cop with DAPs is easy @Ssaab
[5:23:41] Pandrax86: definitely know what I am talking about  lol.
[5:23:42] Chaoszero_goc: before the last two months I havnt watched rp since arma 3 days
[5:23:45] DanLGG: @Eddie1225 They really dont lol. I love that PD is getting consequences. Do I agree with all of them? absolutely not but its fun
[5:23:46] Toastbane: @Toastedgamer03 If he was fired and couldn't become sheriff, I think he'd join CG
[5:23:46] uwurue: not everyone here who disagrees is a “new frog”

[5:24:05] xiouq1: spawn camped TrollDespair
[5:24:07] DickyBird1912: pd kills a server if its bad. worst server ive ever been on the pd was admins meta gaming to get the w even when the person was innocent of what they were accused of. then when called out for it ooc manufactured evidence whilst on stream to make themselves right.
[5:24:08] ChirithyChi: mission accomplished
[5:24:09] lolfish_rs: I'm not gonna lie, I am a total new frog only started watching in 4.0 but I am really enjoying the RP and the storylines that are playing out, I'm a lot more "invested" than I ever thought I would
[5:24:12] jacksmithcje: I get the Magdump but the knight situation is sad cos cornwood told slacks very well and knight even clearly lied on statement as he removed the overcooked admittance
[5:24:12] Chaoszero_goc: did @Ssaab play arma 3 on no pixel?
[5:24:13] figmariee: I personally like keeping the time limit for some situations. if the other players want a chase then they should learn when/how the PD will respond. I think the current PD is still trying to cover all pings and they are stressing too much about it. because you can’t get to them all

[5:24:17] FinexLive: the real ones know perp rp in gmod
[5:24:17] zack12359: Chatting holyyyy
[5:24:18] Toastedgamer03: @Toastbane nah he said before he got he bar license and crane giving him a judge position if he gets fired that he would just not play cornwood
[5:24:18] jakebird_: HC is tough... hard for a lot of people to understand being HC while still having and allowing for fun.
[5:24:24] BurningFlag: Chatting holyyyy
[5:24:24] buddha_hands: @Chichjr yeah back then they were specifically instructed to fill out numbers as a priority, and that had a lot of after-effects that could not be un-done
[5:24:35] seedubbleyou: Holy redditing in the chat OMEGALAUGHING
[5:24:38] Toastedgamer03: so i'm hoping the bar license and crane giving him a judge job would have esfand playing cornwood as a judge for a bit
[5:24:39] yellowtristan: @duranggo those would be new situations, the RP of the crime, chase, etc is over. but yes one RP scenario always leads to another of course
[5:24:39] LoudPackNoReefa: The amount of cops that can keep up with criminals is lower due to lack of good driving officers compared to 3.0 and the pd vehicles are worse. I think starting there is better than shooting
[5:24:42] magnets_: TACO TRUC K
[5:24:43] Eddie1225: OMEGALAUGHING
[5:24:44] RandomShungiteCD: LookUp what the
[5:24:45] sourdoughcookies: taco truck for the boys
[5:24:46] catfish_quackenbush: @Toastbane to be fair, hed prob go to other server with Wrangler and Pred. He said a few days ago he went made a civilian on that server and played a bit.

[5:24:48] ChiefinIt: Chatting

[5:24:58] lizardeyes: he is willy like an armadilla
[5:25:04] BigVeers: it does kinda suck that esfand just wanted to give some good rp and now Cornwood is getting ultra punished for it but do what you gotta do I guess
[5:25:06] jacksmithcje: the knight situation is sad cos cornwood told slacks very well and knight even clearly lied on statement as he removed the overcooked admittance
[5:25:12] duranggo: @yellowtristan no it isn't, its all part of the same RP: the consequences is as important as the setup for the situation
[5:25:15] my69thaccount: esfand said he would make a character and join mr.k if fired

[5:25:54] the_poff: @Eddie1225 yep, i think a ton of good rp can come out of  punishment for cops
[5:25:56] Rockshock: Nothing ends RP except for the players own creativity to be honest.
[5:25:56] WildWillie419: Aziz sassin’
[5:26:00] Toastbane: @imnotyourdude I dunno, he's addicted to RP atm, didn't even play SoD
[5:26:01] heftylefty_prime: @jacksmithcje lying = firing, sometimes.
[5:26:04] Athbreith: People I feel are just thinking a DAP Suspension is Fired. Suspension is just temp break
[5:26:06] Eddie1225: @Ned15 true mhm

[5:26:19] buddha_hands: how could saab officially end all RP that johnson denzel & cornwood can do like this PepeHands
[5:26:20] catfish_quackenbush: @MonsterFuel i dont know, hes pretty deep in RP this time, much more than he was last time. He gave up SoD season 2 and said he wanted to wait till 60.
[5:26:20] FuZroK: @Toastbane then a break is a great idea
[5:26:21] devintalktech: @Ssaab, I think johnson is a great example of getting fired doesn't end teh character
[5:26:23] Toastedgamer03: @Toastbane yeah he did say he doesn't wanna play sod much until they get lvl 60
[5:26:26] Chaoszero_goc: dap the daptain
[5:26:28] BohLTss: would a rule making it 6 people doing crime including people faciliting swaps help????
[5:26:29] xiiiblanks: you let these chatters get to you more than they should. i know its easier said then done but usually its just one guys opinion you are letting get to you when most ppl prob dont even agree with what they said @Ssaab

[5:26:44] thegr8on316: Those 700+ applications will go there too
[5:26:47] jacksmithcje: no I’m saying knight lied and I’m curious of slacks saw that cos I know he wasn’t streaming but he saw the original statement possibly where knight at the bottom says he’s overcooked
[5:26:50] Toxcicle: Didn't Kit want to talk to Slacks anyway?
[5:26:54] Albiwar: honestly, Cornwood should be suspended every time he is on duty longer than 8 hours KEKW  give him time to sleep

[5:27:19] devintalktech: @Ssaab, Johnson should be who everyone learns from if they get fired lol
[5:27:20] jollypnda: i mean people need to talk the mcnulty route and do off duty stuff.
[5:27:22] MrBASins: So Slasks how much longer will it take for the new police to join the patrols?
[5:27:24] FuZroK: Honestly cops should get suspended all the time. Like 24 hour suspensions and then just go back to work
[5:27:25] Athbreith: It's call a Character Arc
[5:27:25] thor798: Clueless
[5:27:25] neonsloths: Crim Cornwood would be so dope lol

[5:27:30] WHATtheINTERROBANG: It wont end for cornwood but your turbos will LULW
[5:27:31] thebigshabam: he roleplays his character IRL hes not gonna quit it lol
[5:27:34] inducedcatharsis: Cornwood could probably do almost anything he wanted to IF he did get fired from the PD anyways
[5:27:35] Gachiguru: bad faith rp
[5:27:36] FinexLive: @AnasKwTii dont worry you will get your erection one day
[5:27:36] WildWillie419: More cops need to commute and RP off duty fr
[5:27:36] Artsii1994: @AnasKwTii true he should be fired for being an L cop
[5:27:38] tonecomms: Cornwood wasn't even supposed to be a cop at first
[5:27:39] itWyrm: @itWyrm Im like 95% sure thats already the rules but i dont watch crims much tbh
[5:27:40] Chaoszero_goc: chat he will terrorize the police on his alts then run for sheriff when it opens,. ez
[5:27:41] Ned15: @ssaab  it's because people think of "Cop characters", instead of just a character with many paths
[5:27:41] Athbreith: Crim Mobboss Cornwood would be some top tier stuff
[5:27:45] BigVeers: so cornwood is getting fully fired?
[5:27:46] Toastbane: I wonder if firing Cornwood leads to Slacks vs Max
[5:27:46] thatclubdj: Absolutely
[5:27:46] Eddie1225: OMEGALAUGHING
[5:27:48] zero_kills_: @ssaab this is like a live TV show that you actively can choose which characters perspective you want to watch from... and instead of yelling at the Tv, chatters can interact in real time and bounce around in chats. It is annoying, but I dont think the majority are doing it in bad faith- people just like getting invested
[5:27:48] buddha_hands: high command doesn't determine all of the players' choices OMEGALAUGHING if they did, things would be a lot easier

[5:27:50] jacksmithcje: I’m not trying to be shitty I’m curious if Saab remembers reading knights statement originally saying he’s overcooked I guess cos that was changed now
[5:27:51] Reanna_x: i remember one of my favorite parts of 3.0 was brian and baas getting suspended by dark and reporting crimes OMEGALAUGHING

[5:58:02] ThePointGaming: its all hallways and stairs
[5:58:02] Privateye21: It's a literal maze
[5:58:07] Zinnabunz: @lora1969 saabSalute gn!

[5:58:16] i_eat_big_cakes: You have to take care of dispatch! They are your first line of communication!
[5:58:16] SmugPls: @Shakestar there was a thing where they told everyone at a meeting that Dispatch shouldnt really be hanging around cells and stuff LUL so people probably confused
[5:58:16] S7VNRedTigers: PoroSad
[5:58:17] zenyatta: have shiny bring back honey buns for only dispatch part time
[5:58:18] Tazmandvl: its isolating

[5:58:21] Abx0r: Backrooms PD
[5:58:21] khrow: Could also hire a captains assistant that screens all your phonecalls and manages your schedule, they could be a clerical role in mrpd

[5:58:24] Fightin_Amish: What about two dispatchers at a time and letting them take breaks within the same shift
[5:58:24] its_R4HUL: SAJ
[5:58:27] blanket4u: too clinical
[5:58:28] SaltDem0n: definitely think about in office jobs other than dispatch imo
[5:58:28] RandomShungiteCD: Learn to adapt NODDERS
[5:58:29] Pee_aRe: oh yeah she always walking around looking for conv and just dancing
[5:58:30] FinexLive: SAJ
[5:58:30] monkz89: she's looking for close knit pd Sadge
[5:58:31] raising_cain_007: let the officers call dispatch to look up if suspects have warrants.
[5:58:31] 2busylookinggood: personalise behind rthe counter?
[5:58:31] chivvyy: damn this is some gigadoom vibes
[5:58:33] McKibbo: PD layout is more like a small hospital or clinic
[5:58:33] eqnjn: Honestly Dispatch ridealongs wouldn't be a terrible idea
[5:58:34] lizardeyes: frinds
[5:58:35] lolfish_rs: she can ride along with him and teach him how to properly write his stuff
[5:58:37] davidayotte: ya she’s saying I think it’s just a bummer trying to find someone
[5:58:39] millzeebb: make an ops dept? dispatch, reception, and office managers? cycle thru shifts
[5:58:41] Mechz71: Duncan could solve this easy
[5:58:41] Jibry: @ThePointGaming i would agree on that. Need more open area per floor
[5:58:43] Aces_o: so dispatch just needs more interactive duties
[5:58:43] yogibv2: have her teach den to pit
[5:58:45] RobialT: aanother person who hates current PD LUL
[5:58:45] Pee_aRe: i feel her

[5:59:08] eqnjn: True let her do ridealongs
[5:59:09] Sonicfear: @eqnjn TBF It should be part of dispatcher training.

[5:59:31] cjohno20: could devs code it to give dispatch crime pings like 10 seconds before cops? reward quick communication?

[6:01:06] Toastedgamer03: gotta do them captain duties

[6:01:15] StreamElements: Please do not meta in chat, which means do not tell Saab stuff happening in RP that his character would otherwise not know.
[6:01:17] Sonicfear: @ShadowedSeraphim Yea I know...sadly..
[6:01:24] itWyrm: you left them slacks SAJ
[6:01:28] grandepike: oop delay
[6:01:36] Artsii1994: so they get the call before the pd
[6:01:38] buddha_hands: hmmmmm could dispatchers perform 1st round interviews? Hmmm
[6:01:39] Artsii1994: Hmmm
[6:01:42] aniquilattion: @cjohno20 if there were more on duty
[6:01:44] RobialT: LUL imagine making responding to calls even worse
[6:01:44] skympii: yeah give them time to escape the area
[6:01:45] al_ex: didn't you guys talk about this being a bad idea at a meeting last week?
[6:01:48] WildWillie419: what if dispatch could shoot indiscriminately
[6:01:52] ShadowedSeraphim: @itWyrm I think its more that all 3 captains were gone
[6:01:53] trinimini10: dispatch will get yelled at
[6:01:59] McKibbo: way to many alerts
[6:02:01] johnmalkovich95: Moon said it was shitshow at 3.0
[6:02:01] 95eagles: you helping the crims?
[6:02:03] CuBanMumzy: what about 911 actual calls for her to answer?
[6:02:09] Artsii1994: i dont think its good for them to get an active before the pd
[6:02:24] itWyrm: @itWyrm Yes i did this crazy thing called a 'joke', hope this helps <3
[6:02:25] Artsii1994: even the ems
[6:02:28] raising_cain_007: I think dispatchers should be the one to look up and confirm a suspect has a warrant.
[6:02:28] eqnjn: What if PD doesn't get the 911s and 311s top left and Dispatch has to relay that info always??
[6:02:34] davidayotte: I like her thinking.. she looks ahead
[6:02:37] FuZroK: dispatch should have guns while at PD and be allowed to shoot out the front door LUL
[6:02:49] troyofathyns: would that hit crim channels?
[6:02:59] Bzarks: @FuZroK we can work with this
[6:03:03] WildWillie419: dispatch can call drone strikes?
[6:03:07] lookingfornothinghere: maybe cops should tell Dispatchers to read license plates
[6:03:11] cjohno20: Maybe have it so PD send plates to dispatch to check if flagged
[6:03:13] WildWillie419: That’s a DAP
[6:03:19] millzeebb: pd only gets alerts in their mdt not in the hud?
[6:03:20] wavep987: Dispatch just needs to receive 911 calls from people. More rp for them.
[6:03:24] WildWillie419: she said she slacks
[6:03:26] skympii: class notif already is delayed to appear let alone having dispatch take the calls first then relay it to the officers
[6:03:27] FinexLive: @Ssaab maybe you can have a toggle for it, like not when they are online but they can enable it
[6:03:27] raising_cain_007: officers could see that a suspect has the warrant. dispatch should be the ones that has the documentation and share it when requested by officers
[6:03:28] judgement_12: can dispatch issue the alert that pop ups? Because civilian 911 seem to rarely be answered
[6:03:32] Lepaca: constant stress to get info out
[6:03:34] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: police tones
[6:03:36] buddha_hands: yeah it being delayed seems like a critical point of failure & a lot of pressure if it relies on them lol
[6:03:38] Dagg17: make duncan talk to dispatch while at mrpd to fix the social issue
[6:03:42] CuBanMumzy: @WildWillie419 i like the drone strike idea
[6:03:45] TheOGWombat: she sounds like a female vigors
[6:03:51] ShadowedSeraphim: @millzeebb I can just see everyone driving with their MDT up lol
[6:03:53] Zinnabunz: dispatch can operate drones PauseMan
[6:03:53] lookingfornothinghere: yep just have people be able to actually call in dispatch with 911 its so easy and bringsso mch RP
[6:03:59] VonDungus: lol, telling your boss you’d rather chill than pay attention. I like her style
[6:04:00] catfish_quackenbush: lets go!!!!!
[6:04:05] Alkemiee: build dispatch off IRL dispatch duties??
[6:04:10] FuZroK: @Dagg17 Yes! Duncan should be dispatch liaison
[6:04:11] cjohno20: Give dispatch a 911 ping for civilian calls that they can send when they get calls
[6:04:12] ShadowedSeraphim: dead cornwood walking

[6:04:57] Artsii1994: i think it will still be cool for the dispatchers to have calls were they can assign cops to certain calls and just be part of the activity with smaller calls
[6:04:59] cjohno20: dashcam control room for dispatch to monitor?

[6:30:19] Pandrax86: @FuZroK It seems pretty toxic to talk down about other streamers, Especially when theyre friends with Ssaab. I see it a lot in this chat and I really enjoy Ssaabs content more than Cornwood lately. They are both on opposite ends of the spectrum when it comes to RP character growth but that doesn't make one better than the other.
[6:30:21] SXR9: peepoClap lost both
[6:30:23] robertsmithjr: the scout should do like 140, those big police suv's can hit like 160+ irl
[6:30:54] Jibry: scout has good acceralation no?
[6:30:55] FuZroK: @Pandrax86 Talking about Cornwood. A fictional RP character. Esfand is amazing. No one said anything about him.

[7:32:53] 1TrueTyrant: @Eddie1225 He just said to make the building operable, listen man
[7:32:54] ArenaKrusher: @buddha_hands true but it could give a much needed morale boost
[7:32:55] Luthercorpz: Not 3rd hand gossip
[7:32:56] urkuri92: "we don't need a new department, but also we should start with a small new department"
[7:32:58] Artsii1994: There still building a command structure before saying hey we got the lapd established so whats the issue
[7:32:59] bertacharm: FuZroK, election
[7:33:01] slomojosh: LSPD isn’t established cause the captains aren’t establishing it
[7:33:02] wavep987: I see the point of another office for processing people up north. Sheriff can come later.

[7:33:41] RexPappa: You people dont want Cornwood as Sheriff?
[7:33:44] catfish_quackenbush: as long as like Slacks said, 80% of the force is in the city, this is a great soltuion to have people patrolling the entire map, while still focusing in the city
[7:33:45] slomojosh: people just dismiss Cornwood
[7:33:46] bennnnboy49: @CaptainRockHard there arent enought for just one department right now
[7:33:51] Wallsh_: @fraudiola9 NO HE just wants the building OPEN so he can process people
[7:33:51] buddha_hands: @ArenaKrusher the only reason morale would be low anywhere remotely related to this concept is if people are going around blaming problems on there being 1 department+acting like it's the solution to everything OMEGALAUGHING
[7:33:52] Usahi_Light: he wants the building open so it doesnt take an hour+ to process people caugh in sandy/paleto
[7:33:58] IvyOlive: so do whatever cornwood wants
[7:33:59] Eddie1225: @CaptainRockHard how can you expand when you dont even have enough on the first part
[7:33:59] Artsii1994: Cornwood taking out all the other departments out if the picture and seeing the sheriifs delartment more
[7:33:59] Eddie1225: how can you expandom
[7:34:03] Bojabes: @slomojosh that was like a week ago, but he's been talking about LASO way before that
[7:34:04] tyreeiv: you have to admit sheriff cornwood would be the best RP
[7:34:06] Eddie1225: thanks twitch
[7:34:06] MillerThyme: He should just go to the state and get it done, bypass the captains
[7:34:07] Eddie1225: OMEGALAUGHING
[7:34:07] MonsterFuel: @RexPappa he can't even agree with the captains on how daps should be given
[7:34:08] Disadabag: I think he's just using persuation to try to push getting it open things he says keep changing
[7:34:08] FSouza_01: Clueless
[7:34:08] Chrisaroo_: chat being weird
[7:34:11] fraudiola9: @slomojosh  maybe if he was a good officer people would respect his opinion more
[7:34:11] iamnxera: how’s PD going?
[7:34:12] monkz89: cornwood too naive
[7:34:20] davidayotte: conrdog is to much uv a brand risk to be a police officer let alone a cherrif
[7:34:20] Ned15: Don't they complain about no FTOs?
[7:34:23] FuZroK: @Usahi_Light Its going to take the same amount of time regardless of location.

[7:34:34] LogicWeasel: @monkz89 Kappa yeah not like he's EVER been close to being sheriff for years before.
[7:34:37] lawlkat: so slacks officers don't patrol? do captains take any fault with this?
[7:34:38] taraannee: i mean i could say the plan to expand but that would be mg info soo

[7:34:56] kreljos: @iamnxera 8h into the stream might do the first patrol soon, so going well
[7:34:56] Usahi_Light: @Usahi_Light How? If you catch someoenin sandy, process in sandy, you walk out the door and patrol again.
[7:35:05] wavep987: I think opening an office up north could be a good middle ground.
[7:35:08] ShadowedSeraphim: Cornwood playing chess when PD playing Checkers :P
[7:35:08] talamah: ParasocialFrenn remember, you're just one message away from being noticed
[7:35:13] thatclubdj: Cornwood thinks the sheriff dept gonna be able to operate under different Standards
[7:35:18] crazyfr0gtv: chat gpt PauseChamp ?
[7:35:19] Kevz95: what makes most sense right now is to open up the sandy PD as LSPD, not BCSO. then there's no extra training, no splitting up the dept. easy compromise
[7:35:20] ArenaKrusher: @buddha_hands meh some do, but others that don`t currently come on duty very ofetn would come more often annd numbers wouuld natrually increase, look at when Pred started his dep, it was litterally the golden age for PD
[7:35:23] RobialT: @lawlkat PD has failed, it's the officers fault apparently
[7:35:24] dakota22446: Tomfoolery start the SO but give cornwood the daps that would suspend him currently

[7:35:47] FinexLive: @Ssaab maybe could have a app for citizen to make statements, you give the report number and it would add their statement to it, probably easy to do on the dev side
[7:35:48] Eddie1225: @dakota22446 OMEGALAUGHING

[7:36:18] Eddie1225: people have rose tinted glasses about 3.0

[7:36:33] misanthropicace2569: guys if you want to argue...refer to 3.0 pd as an swer sheet to what youre complaining about or what to happen
[7:36:39] lawlkat: @buddha_hands what's holding PD back from being ready?
[7:36:43] Buffalohed: @thatclubdj cornwood wants to be sheriff more than anything...

[7:41:02] Faildude: @Kevz95 yeah he also was told long ago to not think about that when PD is not ready yet but still pushing it hard
[7:41:02] wavep987: FTO still have to be chosen. Even if they do it for the wrong reasons, only chosen ones will FTO>

[7:41:51] taraannee: personally & no one has to agree but i think someone being a good fto could show their potential for a senior promotion

[7:43:00] DanLGG: ssaab For every cadet properly trained -1 dap and if they go in the negative they have a higher balance to work with.
[7:43:01] RealistReason: @fraudiola9 Cornwoods attitude makes people want to come on duty and he got more fixes done in the PD in the last 3 days than anyone else has for 2 months.
[7:43:02] stonedmikey: qxcL
[7:43:04] catfish_quackenbush: @CuBanMumzy yea i seen atlesat a couple times, not sure lately though
[7:43:04] buddha_hands: @lawlkat thinking up problems that aren't problems, convincing ppl of a solution that absolutely wouldn't solve actual issues, & taking tons of time spreading negativity around unless that one 'solution' happens, all has real effects on functioning
[7:43:05] chrisestes: What does fto stand for
[7:43:08] puhctek: @catfish_quackenbush, the seniors were just mentioning earlier that aziz has taking out a grand total of zero people; cornwood is cornwood, most of the people he ftos are teaching him
[7:43:12] thricerice1: you need more cops especially cops that already been a cop before so less training time for them
[7:43:14] fraudiola9: @gynechiatrist  brother cornwood should get out the complaining about everything 24x7 ,it's been a month same bit maybe should twy something different
