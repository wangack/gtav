[0:23:58] ItsDerfo: Crazy thing is that it started within the water pipe ride
[0:24:05] Aptness: like there are secondary explosions when the tubes break, this had to be a miss storage of some form of gas

[0:24:46] Dentvis: jesus
[0:24:48] jojaha: I believe
[0:24:52] hotchonky: yeah, gas ignited inside the yellow slide at the bottom. look
[0:25:03] punishedkai: bold choice of the swedish waterpark to replace it with fire, dont think it worked out however
[0:25:06] Alexware02: The fact that they more or less finished its constructions and was about to open it up for it only to blow up is a bit sad

[0:30:22] timbres: Happy Mardi Gras :)
[0:30:25] scha_de: snapchat in 2024 OMEGALUL
[0:30:45] eikkapeikk0: @Nidas it's just that the parliament is blocking Tiktok on their devices
[0:30:45] gostonko: only america can do mass surveillance ReallyMad
[0:30:49] Alexware02: "Finland förbjuder Tiktok i riksdagen – kan vara en säkerhetsrisk"
[0:30:58] Dalm4s: I think that's a given, maybe not even selling LULW
[0:31:06] HavidusMaximus: i feel like snapchat pressures young people to write messages to people even if they dont really want to
[0:31:09] Dalm4s: But is Meta any different?
[0:31:11] HavidusMaximus: so you keep your flames
[0:31:19] HavidusMaximus: making communication kinda weird
[0:31:25] timbres: !meta
[0:31:25] StreamElements: Telling Nidas information that he wouldn't have known without you telling him in the stream. For example if you're watching another stream at the same time and telling Nidas things that are actively happening on the other persons stream. Doing this will get you timed out or banned.
[0:31:34] eikkapeikk0: many finnish companies also have similar policy/recommendation that people dont install Tiktok on their work devices
[0:31:51] eikkapeikk0: i think finnish intelligence agency recommends that
[0:32:03] Dalm4s: @timbres  NOIDONTTHINKSO
[0:32:21] eikkapeikk0: EU is so behind on this kind of things it's insane
[0:32:30] Dalm4s: Doesn't EU wanna do that chat control thing? or.. I forgot.
[0:32:34] Alexware02: So we can stick to instagram, owned by meta which is also a bit sketch with data.

[0:33:48] kidsuper05: SCHIZO CHINA
[0:34:20] eikkapeikk0: apple/google/meta all have mandatory backdoors for the US governement into their data so nothing has changed from whenever Edward Snowden leaked the NSA info

[0:37:30] gostonko: VPNS are way over-hyped for their security
[0:37:37] Dalm4s: It's all down to your ISP in the end.
[0:37:40] pukuotukas666: vpn worse than brita water filter

[0:37:42] Terrozer: only things i use vpns for is getting more out of my streaming services lmao
[0:38:03] jay_jaymann: no it doesn’t, every pc can be fingerprinted so there is no way to protect yourself via the connection
[0:38:07] gostonko: POGGIES

[0:38:49] gurglet: ain't no way I'm trusting companies who yell "trust me!"

[0:40:29] TheSoundy: That would mean cash only too, what a misery
[0:40:35] eikkapeikk0: good VPN's do data encryption and can prevent from *your* ISP sniffing what you do if you have one of those. and yeah i mean if you inhale google products you're fucked regardless but
[0:40:45] pukuotukas666: Best thing to do for security is to confuse google. Sometimes I just run monster truck and loading your own ammo videos on youtube to hide my tracks
[0:40:46] Terrozer: when i watch ads on cable i think.... why are they showing my adverts for medicine for ed? im in my 20s..... i feel like im not being targeted and i dont like it.
[0:41:01] ObamaBinDroning: good evening mates! whats up with the title? LUL
[0:41:13] jay_jaymann: the only way would be to go digital free, no banks only work for cash and no electronic devices at all

[1:14:43] gostonko: yes
[1:14:44] Qwaz: easily
[1:14:47] Diabless: car didnt start or what.
[1:14:51] pukuotukas666: Batteries dont like to be drained empty
[1:14:52] santilloo88: Bad ground?
[1:14:53] scha_de: Why do we have this discussion every winter OMEGALUL
[1:15:05] senlash: LULW
[1:15:10] Qwaz: battery is prob fine, you have something drawing power
[1:15:13] ThicccBrickBoi: Need a battery tender
[1:15:17] brutalmoineau: what a scoundrel
[1:15:18] gostonko: i thought that was what we told you to do this year maaaaan
[1:15:18] iPlayPush: its a good idea xD
[1:15:20] Qwaz: that would work
[1:15:22] ThicccBrickBoi: That should be ok. Am mechanic
[1:15:22] pukuotukas666: Cold is bad too
[1:15:26] minimadman91: they make $20 kill switches
[1:15:27] ObamaBinDroning: I used to do that
[1:15:31] swornenemy1947: i would blame the down stairs tenants.
[1:15:32] Bisnesmies6159: No I do that with my motorcycle
[1:15:41] scha_de: clip this for next please
[1:15:44] djihtrax: ok then perfect mhm
[1:15:45] scha_de: *next year
[1:15:58] glizzygoblinfr: hi bucko, how is life treating you?
[1:16:17] gostonko: battery sensu beans
[1:16:25] minimadman91: if it has a dead cell it’s done
[1:16:34] Soderblad: Battery should be fine just need to cable it and go for a drive to charge it up
[1:16:35] Qwaz: its starting from the extra power of the jump pack
[1:16:37] swornenemy1947: because the alternator keeps the volts and amps going.
[1:16:39] minimadman91: a short in the battery
[1:16:44] Qwaz: but the alternator cant charge the battery fast enough
[1:16:46] Aptness: your alternator could be shot and not charging your vehicle while it's running
[1:16:49] gostonko: the defib is only enough for turnover
[1:16:49] Ripper_CQ: Cranking an engine zaps power if you don't drive the car
[1:16:56] gostonko: need to drive that thing to properly recharge
[1:16:59] brutalmoineau: magic
[1:17:00] Aptness: your battery**
[1:17:22] Qwaz: just plug in the trickle charger for like 2 days
[1:17:24] ThicccBrickBoi: Because it needs to charge fully to have correct capacity. If you take a battery too low on voltage for too long it will sulfate and permanently take that capacity away
[1:17:33] senlash: drbronners give it a good wipe down with dr bronners?
[1:17:45] gostonko: senlash mhm
[1:17:45] Qwaz: @senlash NOOO
[1:17:56] pukuotukas666: @ThicccBrickBoi yeah, thats why you connect it to welder and crank it
[1:18:01] swornenemy1947: plus the alternator is suppose to maintain the battery. charging form time to time is sometimes needed.
[1:18:33] Qwaz: @pukuotukas666 onFire
[1:19:03] Ripper_CQ: Immobilisers drain batteries if you have one
[1:19:37] ThicccBrickBoi: Very unlikely
[1:19:38] scha_de: huh
[1:19:41] gostonko: shouldnt
[1:19:47] Qwaz: you can have a battery kill switch installed and basically disconnect the battery every time you have the car sit
[1:19:49] ThicccBrickBoi: Anything is possible tho but not likely.
[1:19:50] gostonko: unless they fuck something up when they reset the codes
[1:19:55] gostonko: but the battery can set things off yeah
[1:20:14] ThicccBrickBoi: Disconnect the battery should reset all lights. But it can cause lights to turn on
[1:20:19] ObamaBinDroning: I used to do that manually on my Opel KEKW
[1:20:26] alex61043: hey nidas when is daily dota coming back, BIG dota fan here
[1:20:29] pukuotukas666: What opel ?

[1:20:36] gostonko: alex61043 ReallyMad
[1:20:38] Ripper_CQ: Yeah an isolator switch would stop whats draining the battery
[1:20:49] alex61043: @gostonko nidasAha
[1:20:50] Mavmar: we love dota Stare
[1:20:51] ObamaBinDroning: @pukuotukas666 Corsa 2000 edition

[1:21:32] gostonko: 3000GTer
[1:21:37] senlash: 3000GTer
[1:21:40] Qwaz: 3000GTer
[1:22:00] swornenemy1947: you can.
[1:22:04] ThicccBrickBoi: No somewhere hidden would be best
[1:22:22] Qwaz: you can have a mechanic install it somewhere like under the steering wheel
[1:22:26] ThicccBrickBoi: Could use it as extra security
[1:22:47] gostonko: sideeye i might
[1:22:59] ThicccBrickBoi: And you don't want someone seeing it and turning it off while your parked.
[1:23:02] Qwaz: that one is nice and simple
[1:23:07] ThicccBrickBoi: I wouldn't use that style.
[1:23:09] Qwaz: turn the knob
[1:23:09] ObamaBinDroning: you press the button
[1:23:18] gostonko: having to open the hood for it tho NoThanks
[1:23:22] Mavmar: ive seen these. useful if you have a draw
[1:23:22] minimadman91: the blade type is more intuitive
[1:23:26] Qwaz: disconnects the ground yeah
[1:23:27] ObamaBinDroning: it disconnects it
[1:23:35] ThicccBrickBoi: That's called a knife. He use them to test for parasitic draw. There is a lot better quality switches for your purpise
[1:23:42] ObamaBinDroning: magic
[1:23:44] gostonko: always lick ur fingers and touch both terminals NODDERS
[1:23:47] gostonko: improves ur battery life
[1:23:54] ObamaBinDroning: @gostonko KEKL
[1:24:12] PerturbedBandit: it’s just a big open close switch for battery voltage
[1:24:14] brutalmoineau: it tingles
[1:24:18] minimadman91: I’m guessing a butterfly that opens like a valve to make contact
[1:24:24] gostonko: GMC KKonaW
[1:24:42] gostonko: maaaaan
[1:24:42] senlash: classic
[1:24:51] Mavmar: bro has multiple c10s lmao

[1:25:38] ObamaBinDroning: bada bong
[1:25:40] gostonko: rev her!
[1:25:41] iPlayPush: that sounds nice Kreygasm
[1:25:44] gostonko: booooo
[1:25:51] pukuotukas666: Thats shit switch, not what you want. you want click click left right
[1:25:55] Qwaz: you dont, thats fine
[1:26:04] Mavmar: ive seen many people use these
[1:26:12] WundertueteGER: KKona
[1:26:30] pukuotukas666: simpler is better, turning wheel is not simpler
[1:26:34] pukuotukas666: switch is simpler
[1:26:34] brutalmoineau: well, look at kai, not always true
[1:26:41] ThicccBrickBoi: I call that style a battery knife
[1:26:42] Mavmar: probably like a battery quick disconnect
[1:26:51] gostonko: kuk ring
[1:26:51] PerturbedBandit: ultimately it’s best to isolate the draw
[1:27:07] gostonko: NODDERS
[1:27:08] minimadman91: you really dont, especially if you don’t drive often, you can just take the ground off

[1:28:12] gostonko: never wanted to die more
[1:28:27] Mavmar: its more or less just do you want to spend $10 so you can just flip a switch

[2:00:43] kromestyle: Yea true
[2:00:44] gostonko: i think the GTA trailers lens effects and handheld cam shake attribute a lot to what you're talking about
[2:00:56] scha_de: Filters
[2:00:56] Krokzter: it's really hard to make good humans feel real, the game that did it best for me was cyberpunk
[2:01:03] porkcube: it's super saturated

[2:03:15] gostonko: even if somehow they made a bad game it would still sell like crazy
[2:03:28] gostonko: R* are crazy
[2:03:29] VII_obscura: Even if the story was so awful, the gameplay loop of GTA/RD in general is just so much fun that it'll be a success no matter waht
[2:03:33] yeslewd: I saw one video of them cutting wood and shit
[2:03:33] divandesalon: most expensive game ever incoming
[2:03:35] punishedkai: i hope in gta 6 they have realistic ball shrinking like in red dead
[2:03:37] yeslewd: or something
[2:03:49] Dentvis: @punishedkai mhm
[2:03:51] GoutOfWar: it's rockstar not bethesda there's zero reason to think it'll be bad

[2:03:53] LaughyDaffy206: The other day I saw a vid of railway workers actually hammering in the nails to the tracks in RDR 2
[2:03:54] Krokzter: no company has the budget that R* get for their games, there's almost no competition

[2:04:57] swankytiger942221: The thing is that your thoughts on trash might be different
[2:04:59] swankytiger942221: Lmao
[2:05:12] BloomOnline: I'm worried the missions will be mostly killing waves of baddies and gta gunplay is kinda dated. But that's not a game killer
[2:05:18] bonedead: one mans trash...
[2:05:23] Ererior: out of 100?
[2:05:30] divandesalon: the game will be good i hope but i don't wanna be the one who pay the costs
[2:05:44] swankytiger942221: It will 100% be over 5 but it could def be under 7. Ppl are talking abiut it that it's going to be a 9 or 10 tho
[2:05:45] BloomOnline: Rdr2 gunplay is some 2008 shit
[2:05:46] alex61043: i hope its less arcady online
[2:05:46] spitswap: we'll be able to play it on pc in the year 2035 I can't wait
[2:05:48] Maiks: I wish they take some stuff like the melee combat from rdr2
[2:05:53] bonedead: i hope they have like 100 UI elements on my screen at all times
[2:05:59] scha_de: @BloomOnline Drive there, follow this guy, shoot these bad boys, escape the police nikezClassic

[2:06:40] Mavmar: isnt that like the first michael mission lol
[2:06:40] punishedkai: the most memorable mission on gta 5 was when i went to the area and i killed that guy and i had to escape the area

[2:06:57] 9Rux: the only thing I remember the boat mission LUL
[2:06:57] gostonko: yeah that was a great mission
[2:07:02] Mavmar: I hope they do more stuff like switching between characters during missions
[2:07:04] scha_de: gtaV missions are so terribly scripted, it hurts
[2:07:08] divandesalon: Trevor is the funniest
[2:07:10] OkayyJake: i remember the paparazzi one for some reason
[2:07:23] gostonko: Looking
[2:07:27] divandesalon: when he becomes mad to the rednecks
[2:07:34] Maiks: The fame or shame tattoo mission was good
[2:07:45] HowdyAves: do you think they’ll block access to parts of the map like they did in GTA’s prior to 5?
[2:08:05] BloomOnline: I prefer Gomer voice tbh

[2:09:06] hugoorm: Hope there is gonna be more choices that impact the campaign
[2:09:10] spitswap: mini map*
[2:09:25] Kikobri_: I hope GTA6 still has the craziness of the previous ones, the trailer's tone was more serious than usual
[2:09:34] earth_baby_: I liked the assassination missions that were connected to the stock market…. only learned about it from the internet tho
