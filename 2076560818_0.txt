[3:09:36] Vizi797: Yea, how often will you be doing 8 hours straight of Lumber really? You could probably manage to float above 50 with some padding
[3:10:18] inus2: unless the amount you lose scales on how much you already have
[3:10:30] inus2: like how wood dropped by a billion for one day of sani
[3:10:30] Thrath: Yeah like if you can float between 50-100 you would be in a perfect spot
[3:11:31] Vizi797: Sani man rep loss being percentage based just seems like... way to cruel to be the case right? COPIUM
[3:12:17] inus2: dunno it seems like the logical thing to me after seeing the wood guy rep drop by a ton at first and then not drop a lot for later sani runs

[6:26:23] Bigfredstallbeer: I like the female insight. I've never even thought about under the streetlight thing.
[6:26:45] mewstrology: I keep my backseats down so no one can easily enter the back and hold a gun to my head (like at a store or gas station). I also obsessively lock my doors
[6:26:55] mewstrology: I also keep a truckers hat in my car so people at a glance assume I'm a man and not a woman. It avoids people targeting me :)
