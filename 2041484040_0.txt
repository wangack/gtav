[4:19:13] CAYKE__: They will sell quick once people know
[4:19:15] Aiden: to -1 it, this beta doesn't include av1 yet, but it does improve quality since transcoding is generally better with your gpu, but latency improves
[4:19:23] Aiden: since he butchered the explanation
[4:19:29] kangg: Maths
[4:19:35] Insaif: katesGiggles
[4:19:38] minusxero: HELLO GOOD SIR AND/OR MADAM I AM IN NEED OF NO LESS THAN A DOZEN BEDS DO YOU HAVE THIS FOR ME

[4:19:56] Aiden: yup
[4:20:02] doc_sharon: WOW
[4:20:10] CAYKE__: I am at 4 to Kate.
[4:20:12] A_Humble_Wooper: I have ~3 seconds latency to Kate right now.
[4:20:16] Aiden: UK
[4:20:20] Aiden: i had about 2-3 before
[4:20:34] Kthanid: So similar distance say I have to Kate.
[4:20:36] Aiden: it'll likely dip
[4:20:48] KarnEvil: I'm at 2.5s to kate.  so East coast USA to west coast Canada
[4:20:49] kangg: katesHm
[4:20:55] AshuraX13: I have 1.5 and we are on opposite sides
[4:21:02] Insaif: So, I have 1.5 to 2.5 latency to Kate. With the upgrade, does that mean I'll be at 0?
[4:21:12] abblepiewit: 4.2s on the same continent
[4:21:20] Aiden: yea
[4:21:21] RubyBlade_: I have ~2

[4:21:59] AshuraX13: I love how low the latency is for interactions
[4:22:01] StarDebris91: I get 1.5 when I pause and play, but if I leave the stream for a while, I get a second here and there of latency
[4:22:04] Aiden: the thing about client side transcoding is its really just how fast twitch can throw those bytes across the world
[4:22:07] kangg: imGlitch
[4:22:08] Insaif: That's wicked.
[4:22:12] Aiden: rather than the pitstop to transcode

[6:12:55] AshuraX13: It also seems like Nick and Michael don't trust him either
[6:13:26] A_Humble_Wooper: Benji has done little to nothing to attempt to regain their trust, either, as far as I can tell.
[6:13:49] AshuraX13: katesCheck Sports guy?
[6:14:01] doc_sharon: I'm a little surprised Nick and Michael went back onto a gang/group after what happened in 3.0
[6:14:03] A_Humble_Wooper: This school has a huge athletic zone, huh.

[6:29:42] jedi_raccoon: facts
[6:29:43] VTMonster: you only need like 5 reusable bags and that's just in case you lose one
[6:29:49] VoidedZReaper: also those bags were ALOT easier to shove in your pocket ot take to store to reuse them

[6:37:59] Kthanid: Sometimes it just takes swapping and oops 6 hours have passed, we've seen that on V in the past.
[6:38:06] Larkonus: Both characters both bring unique vibes, and roll with people with different (but each great) vibes.
[6:38:14] AshuraX13: Fun is being had, that is all that matters
[6:38:22] Sarag_the_Dragon: at least he won't have to give his D
[6:38:32] doc_sharon: Having fun is the most important Yesyes it IS a game after all
[6:38:51] Hoocairz: Also Veronica's grinder old lady walk
[6:38:56] f2pOH: Wish I could be around for more V or Maxx but I’ve been so deeply hooked on Buddha’s journey and that demon never sleeps
[6:39:13] minusxero: A week ahead even
[6:39:21] doc_sharon: @f2pOH things have been POPPIN OFF lately KEKW
[6:39:26] A_Humble_Wooper: It's nice that they've moved the club meetings to not-Sunday, too. So you don't need to choose between being there on your day off, or missing key stuff.
[6:39:33] KarnEvil: @f2pOH katesGiggle
[6:39:54] f2pOH: @doc_sharon no doubt, it’s so good to see everyone HARD addicted ngl katesGiggle
[6:39:58] jedi_raccoon: every once and awhile I watch Lang during my lunch breaks at work
[6:40:12] Crafty_Crystal: I thought one of her main character traits is she doesn’t do emotions much so I used the word detached
[6:40:28] mister_nibbles: whenever this stream isnt online ive been watching a bit of cornwood, hes absolutely hilarious KEKW
[6:40:39] slmyrick: I loved Nancy, but it seemed at the end it wasn’t as enjoyable for you with the constant vending machine requests. it’s so nice to see you having such a good time with friends. and honestly the gags have been soooo funny in 4.0
[6:40:40] DatMexicanOG: Buddha mentioned earlier how he misses RPing with you.
[6:40:40] abblepiewit: I'm kinda glad that in late 3.0 I ended up sticking mostly to Kate, Summer, Custy, and Eagle streams, because it's not even possible to follow all four of them right now, let alone Buddha or the (other) Italians or the ADMC or...
[6:40:41] Kthanid: @Crafty_Crystal If you notice she's quite emotive with the club and people she's getting close to.
[6:40:45] jedi_raccoon: it is
[6:41:00] f2pOH: But I still keep my sub up for ya bc you big time deserve all the support @kate katesL
[6:41:08] Crazith: I am watching more of this group over others as I like the slower progression and figuring it out seem more rewarding then min-maxing everything
[6:41:14] KarnEvil: I wonder how much they used for mat prices in their calcs
[6:41:16] A_Humble_Wooper: You could probably sell the fancy beds for like 10k each. katesGiggle
[6:41:40] jedi_raccoon: and I’ve watched some of Harry
[6:41:51] Hoocairz: I'm watching a lot of Raiders in general. And I put on Cornwood to go to sleep.
[6:41:58] A_Humble_Wooper: Heh
[6:42:11] AshuraX13: I did love watching things like the Casino arc, but I am enjoying just sticking here and learning as you do
[6:42:21] A_Humble_Wooper: Yesyes
[6:42:41] Crafty_Crystal: @kthanid I wasn’t referring to the club at all sorry.
[6:42:46] doc_sharon: Yesyes and alot of the connects she made early on at Senor Buns, too
[6:43:10] Crafty_Crystal: yep
[6:43:45] AshuraX13: Yeah, most other people get "Hey, what's up? " MaxxRoll
[6:44:08] minusxero: But we all know the one Maxx has the MOST emotion for is Bev, February 29th can't come soon enough
[6:44:16] slmyrick: I love the 2 totally different friend groups on your 2 characters too. As a viewer it’s cool to be exposed to new RP folks. But also both groups are hilarious
[6:44:18] Insaif: @minusxero katesBonk
[6:44:44] doc_sharon: it's been nice to see V hang out with people outside of just Nick in 4.0, too Yesyes
[6:44:55] AshuraX13: I missed that too
[6:44:57] abblepiewit: Both have their pros and cons, good and bad days, etc. IMO it was a great choice to have both a new character and an existing one to be able to swap between, Kate. katesL
[6:45:07] f2pOH: Speaking of past connections, it was very amusing seeing Mehdi’s 7tv emote about V in his chat while he played Brian earlier today
[6:45:19] NoharTheShark: my perspective as a viewer is more stuff seems to happen while v is awake compared to maxx where most things seem to happen during hours where she would normally be sleeping...so v gets to experience things while maxx is constantly getting caught up on what she missed
[6:45:29] Insaif: It's also very nice that both characters have friends and a support structure already. katesL
[6:45:30] AshuraX13: I love V and Reggie being friends. Like Jill and Reggie were friends
[6:45:34] A_Humble_Wooper: @f2pOH Istrappedabombonthatb this one?
[6:45:35] minusxero: It's already been very fun when stories cross streams incidentally, like Veronica hearing the cop comms from the Raiders chase
[6:45:40] doc_sharon: Istrappedabombonthatb
[6:45:57] f2pOH: @a_humble_wooper yap, I completely forgot about that one katesGiggle katesGiggle katesGiggle
[6:46:06] Insaif: Yeah, it's always so late.
[6:46:27] A_Humble_Wooper: katesGiggle
[6:46:52] f2pOH: But I typically watch on mobile so it’s just that long af line of text for me
[6:47:25] AshuraX13: Yep, I've accepted that a lot of Raiders stuff will happen while I'm asleep and I'm okay with that
[6:47:31] Insaif: That was so much fun and silly.
[6:47:33] NoharTheShark: i'm hoping as the club grows there will be a more even mix of people being around
[6:47:34] Kthanid: I really really enjoyed the vibes on Saturday.
[6:47:47] KarnEvil: the big question is when is Maxx going to pick up her mandatory ex-bbmc stray katesGiggle
[6:48:00] Nightbot: Follow Kate on Instagram! instagram.com/kate.ttv
[6:48:02] Insaif: I guess Eve got her clerk job back.
[6:48:03] itGlenn: everton peepoHappy
[6:48:05] A_Humble_Wooper: @f2pOH yeah, BTTV has a shorter character limit so we had to cut the name off here. It's the same image tho if you're on a PC with the plugin installed. katesGiggle
[6:48:08] Insaif: katesGiggles
[6:48:08] lorddracnor: Eve's a clerk?
[6:48:09] doc_sharon: Everton katesFlower
[6:48:10] jedi_raccoon: Eve
[6:48:12] Crafty_Crystal: This group is also a lot earlier than V for a lot too. so the beginning of the clubs days and the end of the Simone’s days
[6:48:16] Insaif: oop
[6:48:22] KarnEvil: lol
[6:48:24] Insaif: Well, now you have a spare. KEKW

[6:48:49] jedi_raccoon: ooo
[6:49:00] doc_sharon: I keep hoping Eagle makes a Guild character like she said, but V does not love the Guild either KEKW
[6:49:00] A_Humble_Wooper: Eve Saususge Eagle katesFlower
[6:49:03] mister_nibbles: who's gonna go hunting? Reggie Might
[6:49:21] Insaif: katesGiggles Nice, Nibbles.

[6:50:16] A_Humble_Wooper: Honestly you could probably name your price for the high quality bed. Nobody knows what they cost yet, so they'll believe you.
[6:50:18] Insaif: Leo and Adam is an interesting pair....
[6:50:18] rickbuh: 2100 for basic gives you a lot of room for profit
[6:50:27] Insaif: NODDERS

[6:50:48] sreylas: Adam as a dr has been gold
[6:51:04] Crafty_Crystal: how long did they even date? Were they actually even a couple?
[6:51:04] AshuraX13: PauseChamp
[6:51:11] Insaif: katesPlot
[6:52:20] Insaif: If Reggie is getting the Basic wood at 10, it brings the bed costs down a bit.
[6:52:47] A_Humble_Wooper: @Crafty_Crystal I think they only went on a couple dates before it fell apart? I don't remember what V knows about actual specifics tho.
[6:52:51] Hoocairz: I mean, that's bed industry standard
[6:53:09] Insaif: Yes
[6:53:14] Siirika: Yes
[6:53:24] Siirika: Scroll right
[6:53:27] Insaif: On the far right.
[6:53:36] AshuraX13: Going for scroll
[6:53:39] f2pOH: Classic BIS @hoocairz
[6:53:42] Insaif: It adds it in to the total of the mats.

[6:55:45] VTMonster: 50K for a high quality bed?
[6:55:45] Insaif: Clap
[6:55:51] KarnEvil: YISSSS trade ins for sure
[6:56:03] TPRJones: will this be the first publin Nikea ad?
[6:56:11] sreylas: maybe 10k
[6:56:11] Insaif: @VTMonster You could do $10k for HQ, or maybe $5k for trade in, and still make a good profit.
[6:56:12] KarnEvil: I could see 10k for the fancy bed though
[6:56:22] f2pOH: That’s 3.0 rates, 50k
[6:56:34] f2pOH: Maaaadness
[6:56:34] Insaif: @f2pOH Yeah, that's hyper inflation.
[6:56:46] VTMonster: Oh, I heard it with an extra zero in the total
[6:56:50] Crafty_Crystal: @a_humble_wooper  from Nancy’s pov they only went on a few dates and weren’t even exclusive. That’s why I was asking.
[6:56:59] sreylas: at 10k still 100% profit
[6:57:07] Insaif: I'd say at minimum you want to make something like 50% profit on anything you make to cover various costs and time.
[6:57:19] minusxero: The great thing about trade-in is the trade-in becomes mats for making new fancies

[7:30:07] A_Humble_Wooper: katesPlot
[7:30:14] Insaif: It makes money for the club, but doesn't help the members make money to feed into the club or cover themselves. katesShrug
[7:30:23] KarnEvil: sani is trash for money if you don't get a share of the mats.
[7:30:32] Crafty_Crystal: but sani messes up other rep
[7:30:59] doc_sharon: Club's got some catching up to do it seems
[7:31:04] Insaif: katesDesk
[7:31:05] itGlenn: katesDesk

[7:31:15] doc_sharon: katesMadge
[7:31:22] if0rg0t2remember: its almost like nobody listens to Maxx DESKCHAN
[7:31:38] doc_sharon: they literally had a meeting where they were told to drop it all and do sani when asked katesPalm
[7:31:47] Insaif: But if doing Sani tanks the other jobs...
[7:32:56] doc_sharon: how can they get to higher levels if they are always doing sani KEKW
[7:32:56] hecktobreakfast: PeepoComfy PeepoComfy PeepoComfy PeepoComfy
[7:32:56] Crazith: sighs
[7:33:03] abblepiewit: Sounds like sani is higher floor but lower ceiling, then?
[7:33:04] Kthanid: it feels like every job is going to have that initial hurdle of investment of time.
[7:33:05] mister_nibbles: if only there had been a plan to have everyone on a different thing from the beginning KEKW
[7:33:06] Insaif: @doc_sharon katesSmile
[7:33:30] AshuraX13: Doing well? Have you heard of Nikea? katesBusiness /jokes
[7:33:32] Crafty_Crystal: towing was making more money than sani
[7:33:34] hecktobreakfast: Let's not get too critical.
[7:33:47] f2pOH: @kthanid big time, seems like a lot of people are fixating on immediate cash ROI and not considering rep
[7:34:07] Insaif: Man, Maxx is so zen right now she's floating. peepoMeditate katesGiggle
[7:34:10] f2pOH: or other fringe benefits
[7:34:13] doc_sharon: I would love to see the numbers on that KEKW
[7:34:20] hecktobreakfast: peepoMeditate
[7:34:33] AshuraX13: Divided by 4
[7:34:46] jedi_raccoon: Maxx is an X-Men, she’s levitating
[7:35:02] Crazith: but think about possible future possibilities is all I can say
[7:35:03] Insaif: It sounds like it's not much better doing Sani than other stuff.
[7:35:23] xX_Before_The_Dawn_Xx: well duh, that's why she has the extra X
[7:35:27] if0rg0t2remember: are they working toward the racks and mining more btc?
[7:35:33] jedi_raccoon: haha
[7:35:37] doc_sharon: so after 10 runs, why do they stop?  Like that one day, Maxx and the boys did like 25 runs KEKW
[7:36:00] doc_sharon: exactly!
[7:36:14] VTMonster: Could always be in a tail car to not tank rep
[7:36:27] doc_sharon: that's why it's worth letting people do the other jobs Yesyes
[7:36:45] Insaif: It feels like doing something else, but being required to jump in and do sani, will kill progression on just about anything else.
[7:36:50] f2pOH: Tail car could be really smart for a lot of reasons
[7:37:02] Pleasantmsp: We remember katesYEP
[7:37:08] hecktobreakfast: Yeah a tail car is smart.
[7:37:48] kangg: katesHm

[7:38:36] AshuraX13: Ok
[7:38:37] Pleasantmsp: katesGiggles
[7:38:38] A_Humble_Wooper: Habits like that are hard to kill, yeah.
[7:38:39] GenuineMind: welp, you broke the seal

[7:39:07] Crazith: I could see G6, but never Grind
[7:39:12] f2pOH: *flashes MIB laser pen across all of chat*
[7:39:14] ezzie_311: what's Maxx's personality like? ... business savvy like Nancy Drew?
[7:39:16] Hoocairz: When you said "you" you meant what she represents, which is the club.
[7:39:24] doc_sharon: Yeah, it's just is not sustainable
[7:39:30] A_Humble_Wooper: Sani is good, but it's not the ONLY good thing, yeah. Yesyes
[7:39:31] Siirika: Didn't you say you wanted her to maybe do mechanic stuff like early on?
[7:39:32] paullt2: The second they do something else and tank their sani rep, something amazing will unlock with high sani rep katesGiggle
[7:39:35] jedi_raccoon: remember what lol
[7:39:36] AshuraX13: Maxx is burn it all and everything for the club
[7:39:37] ezzie_311: ah gotcha 👌

[7:40:40] f2pOH: Thanks for giving me some chill vibes, just finished my nails a little bit ago harrWarry katesL
[7:40:53] Kthanid: Questioning to understand, not to criticize.
[7:40:54] Crafty_Crystal: It’s also more cost effective to only run sani with 2 but more there’s a lot of risk
[7:41:02] Insaif: NODDERS
[7:41:11] doc_sharon: And everyone is burnt out on that job NODDERS
[7:41:19] AshuraX13: Yeah
[7:41:26] Insaif: It's either all for the club and no one pays dues, or they have to do something else and Sani tanks.
[7:41:31] Crazith: yeah I can see tedious job burnout
[7:41:32] hecktobreakfast: We need to let the club learn and grow without being overly critical.
