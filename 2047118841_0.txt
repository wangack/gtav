[6:05:06] gadget_t: Automatic you don't need to shift
[6:05:07] UtilityXD: automatic shifts for you, seq you shift
[6:05:07] AlaskanPipeline89: seq u shift
[6:05:08] Sc4le: auto picks the gears for you, sequential lets you pick
[6:05:09] lucho724_: automatic you don't have to do anything
[6:05:09] ch4mm_: sequential is paddle shift
[6:05:11] vedysuace: no shifting
[6:05:11] Tempah___: it‚Äôs all done for you
[6:05:11] Cambellar: you have to pic the gear in sequential the car does it in autopmatic
[6:05:12] souceboi: sequential you still shift
[6:05:13] jaylop94: Sequential you need to press uo and down to change gears
[6:05:13] stephen_021: u have to shift
[6:05:13] brittybop: automatic you don't shift gears, the car does it
[6:05:16] jaylop94: Automatic does it all
[6:05:16] rob_pwners: auto does everything. seq you shift but no clutch
[6:05:18] Eemelii: automatic does everything for you
[6:05:19] Nemo7: You dont have to use the clutch
[6:05:20] SkepticReaper: you do gear shifts for sequential auto you dont have to switch
[6:05:20] psicosmoker1979: auto the gearbox does everything
[6:05:24] AlaskanPipeline89: seq shift without clutch
[6:05:24] jr_ls: that u are choosing when to shift
[6:05:30] TekEvolution: Automatic is just gas and brake
[6:05:31] een1Z: Yep
[6:05:31] ss_dhillon: Same
[6:05:33] hmartin317: auto shifts without you other has paddle shifters
[6:05:35] victiii25: same
[6:05:38] AlaskanPipeline89: seq is middleground
[6:05:41] brittybop: yeah I'd never heard of sequential before 4.0 either
[6:05:43] Eemelii: sequential is more racecar shit
[6:05:44] AlaskanPipeline89: yes
[6:05:45] Maxverine: Yes its not
[6:05:47] LyghtSpark: Manual = Clutch Sequential = Paddle shifters (no clutch) Automatic = shifts for you
[6:05:47] lucho724_: Auto is everything done for you. Sequential is you have to change gear. Manual is you have to hit clutch and change gear.
[6:05:48] jaylop94: Sequential just removes the clutch
[6:05:52] Motomasher: Seq is manual with no shifting
[6:05:53] VendettaUK: there is manual sequential shifters  too i had one in my drift car to change  gear it was up  or down thats it
[6:05:54] SkepticReaper: the clutch
[6:05:54] HEGGA: On NP you can tell the difference when you hear the clicks when you change gear
[6:05:55] souceboi: Sequential and auto both have auto clutches
[6:05:55] gadget_t: Whether you need to push a clutch to shift
[6:05:56] psicosmoker1979: secuencial is a manual with helps
[6:05:57] AlaskanPipeline89: manual u have to clutch
[6:05:57] seratodopemine: Clutch
[6:05:57] Motomasher: clutch
[6:05:58] Freddiepines: 3 pedals vs 2, IRL lol
[6:05:58] HEGGA: That is sequential
[6:05:58] lucho724_: If you have to hit the clutch
[6:05:58] vedysuace: sequential you don‚Äôt have to let off gas when you shift
[6:05:58] irave1337: i never even knew there such thing as sequential
[6:05:59] jerabet: with manual you gotta clutch manually
[6:05:59] UtilityXD: In game you can tell if you hear the gears grinding
[6:05:59] Cambellar: if you change the gear and you hear a clicking sound its sequential
[6:06:02] jaylop94: Clutch
[6:06:06] stephen_021: it will grind the gears with no clutch
[6:06:08] Motomasher: try change gear without clutching
[6:06:15] Tempah___: manual is a gear shift and clutch, seq is paddle shift no clutch
[6:06:16] Vargos28: seq you change gears, full manual you hold clutch change gear then release clutch
[6:06:20] interfistin: manual clutch and shift needed ,sequential no clutch but shift needed ,automatic no clutch no shift

[6:06:25] Eemelii: manual ‚Äùgrinds‚Äù the gears if you dont clutch
[6:06:27] AlaskanPipeline89: think of a lambo with paddles
[6:06:29] jaylop94: Yes
[6:06:31] SkepticReaper: yes
[6:06:32] Vargos28: yes the clutch
[6:06:33] jr_ls: for instance in a race point of view automatic might make u shift earlier and sequentialu can choose to shift alittle later
[6:06:33] Frarbby: yes
[6:06:33] Maxverine: Yes
[6:06:33] AlaskanPipeline89: paddles is seq
[6:06:33] lucho724_: yes
[6:06:34] michaelVETTAS: @silent Manual you use a cluth with your foot, Seq the computer is the clutch
[6:06:35] jaylop94: The clutch
[6:06:36] VVikkedChikken: automatic is all computer controlled, it shifts based on rpms and stuff. sequential is paddle shifter, you press the paddle and it shifts the gear for you. manual has a shifter, you press the clutch, change the gear yourself, and let the clutch out
[6:06:37] SkepticReaper: the clutch pedal
[6:06:40] scarlettx_: clutch pedal
[6:06:41] UtilityXD: manual you have to clutch, sequential you just shift gears
[6:06:41] Eemelii: yes the clutch
[6:06:42] lucho724_: Sequential is usually paddle
[6:06:43] Maxverine: There is bind for clutch
[6:06:44] Motomasher: yes holding the clutch as you shift
[6:06:46] Tempah___: manual you need a bind for clutch
[6:06:47] souceboi: Seq is just shifting, manual is w/clutch
[6:06:48] psicosmoker1979: YES 3 pedals maunal
[6:06:48] lucho724_: Manual is pedal
[6:06:50] shadow091319: yes you dont push a clutch button
[6:06:50] Glenn7789123: @Silent this will help you    sequential is NO clutch manual you NEED to use the clutch just think of it like that
[6:06:52] een1Z: lol
[6:06:54] Refanpng: xd
[6:06:55] jamiebeaches: You've never done sani, and it shows

[6:07:02] Tempah___: yes
[6:07:02] shadow091319: yes
[6:07:02] Eemelii: yes
[6:07:02] 4churchbull98: auto the car shifts for you in seq you Need to Shift the gears but you dont need to press the clutch yourself. in manual you need to do everything yourself @silent
[6:07:03] Nemo7: OMEGADANCEBUTFAST
[6:07:05] Eemelii: Sisi

[6:07:14] souceboi: Clap
[6:07:15] Tempah___: yeah calling you dumb
[6:07:18] EmoIvyTSB: just clutch pedals maunal
[6:07:18] Glenn7789123: yes
[6:07:19] markoismyname: yea sequential is no clutch but still have to manually shift up and down
[6:07:20] psicosmoker1979: yes
[6:07:23] Eemelii: exactly
[6:07:28] Glenn7789123: sequential dont need clutch
[6:07:29] SkepticReaper: yeah you can hear the gears grinding if you dont clutch
[6:07:39] lucho724_: @Silent think of it as driving on easy, medium and hard mode
[6:07:40] mykeeeee_: Groupe6 trucks might be manual now?
[6:07:41] Maxverine: lol
[6:07:42] UtilityXD: There's an audio difference as well if you haven't noticed, sequential just makes a click noise
[6:07:42] HEGGA: When you drive now, listen for the click when you shift gear
[6:07:45] michaelVETTAS: the cars computer handles the cluth with seq
[6:07:47] Eemelii: Clap
[6:08:06] vedysuace: sequential irl usually comes in automatic cars
[6:08:06] lucho724_: Manual will be better for racing
[6:08:06] Refanpng: nodd
[6:08:07] een1Z: Tbh the car should let u know wtf u are driving since irl u can tell but Nopixel u have to check
[6:08:30] 4churchbull98: sequentiall is normally a lot quicker @silent
[6:08:32] SkepticReaper: gotta learn to money shift for racing
[6:08:34] EmoIvyTSB: automatic transmission is better
[6:08:41] lucho724_: The race scene will prb be dominated by manual cars. Daily drivers will prob be automatic and sequential
[6:08:49] Glenn7789123: all manual's will be faster tbh
[6:08:49] Eemelii: clutching a sequential might slow you down, if they coded it to have a clutch
[6:09:01] een1Z: lol L
[6:09:02] mykeeeee_: Racing will have categories like manuals only or at only
[6:09:08] Maxverine: it sounds cool but racing manual is gonna be a pain
[6:09:12] rubyn0odle: manual is the way for drifting taking corners in racing
[6:09:13] lucho724_: Manual will just have that higher tier potential

[6:09:25] ImKrezai: the worst thing irl when going from a manual car to and auto. trying to use the clutch and just stomping on the floorpan OMEGADANCE
[6:09:28] lucho724_: once you are used to it, you will be fine
[6:09:29] Glenn7789123: al that extra work will make u much faster tho
[6:09:32] jerabet: Sequential is usually the race car transmission.
[6:09:40] psicosmoker1979: PRESS THE CLUTCH AND DONT SHIFT GEARS, IF IS WELL COEDED U FEAL LIKE YOU NOT HAVE POWER IN THE WEELLS
[6:09:47] domgeval19: Driving in to high of gears in corners will fuck up you engine faster i think
[6:09:49] VendettaUK: as i said there is manual  sequsentials too tho there its a gear leaver that you press  up or down to shift  and some have alever you put on them to act as a clutch
[6:10:07] lucho724_: yah, you can make any car automatic i think
[6:10:12] mykeeeee_: When you mastered the skill to drive manual
[6:10:12] lucho724_: ehh idk about aht
[6:10:15] Glenn7789123: nope

[6:10:23] SkepticReaper: @ImKrezai thats why you just smash your foot into the dead pedal till you just forget about the clutch lol
[6:10:24] lucho724_: i think that will be the skill difference
[6:10:24] Glenn7789123: manual will alwase win
[6:10:29] psicosmoker1979: All the supercars will be secuential
[6:10:31] een1Z: I think manual is gonna have the edge u just need to change gear at the right time
[6:10:32] lucho724_: a good manual car gets that extra boost
[6:10:39] Maxverine: Like I mentioned earlier... if you can jump gears its cool... but without that.. having to press down shift 5 times while taking a sharp corner sounds like a pain
[6:10:44] rubyn0odle: manual u can higher RPM out of a corner, that makes it better
