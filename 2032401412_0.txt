[3:08:30] Zombiesweat: But probably need some safety guards in a legal one
[3:08:42] RaisenOx: IRL sure, but is it illegal to bet in Los Santos?
[3:08:54] Zombiesweat: On the surface it's legal, then the underground too

[3:28:13] evergreentyr: Book is great, film is great.  Fight Club is easy to misinterpret because the themes of the film are kind of obscure.
[3:28:22] DudeDidgeridoo: @Zombiesweat You've seen it? crystWiggle
[3:28:28] clownpuncher_: Fight Club teaches mentally ill people that if they shoot themselves in the head they will be better than ever
