[5:26:54] Janman88: is there currently even a competitions to AWS?
[5:27:01] MidKnightRider: John Twitch
[5:27:08] AgentOrange666_: Traffic is expensive especially at that amount twitch shifts around with full hd streams
[5:27:12] Shade_B: @Janman88 not even close
[5:27:24] snikiturtul: define data, do you mean storage, bandwidth, or user data Hm @KristoferYee (the first and last are dirt cheap)
[5:27:46] AngelKnivez: does it hurt when you do that cool voice for Jay?!
[5:27:47] sandeep_bs: bandwidth I think sniki Hmm
[5:27:52] THE_SOLAR: you could do gruber eats and make a profit off of delivery fees
[5:27:57] SinsHD: AngelKnivez ikitHi
[5:27:57] surelyURjokingMrFeynman: to AWS? Azure, GCP
[5:28:01] THE_SOLAR: snr buns foot traffic about to fall

[5:28:15] mokoto05: neutrenNote
[5:28:18] PewPew_Paw: @AngelKnivez yes Sadding
[5:28:19] Raided: I believe most of twitch's expense is the transcoding they do for every partner stream / some affliates. This is a crazy amount of processing power.
[5:28:21] Bestevenn_: wouldnt youtube get more viewers?
[5:28:24] Shade_B: 720p is fine for 2nd monitor
[5:28:34] anduadv: yeah on mobile 1080p isnt really that good
[5:28:37] LamePuf: make 1080 only for subs if possible
[5:28:41] Shade_B: 1080p is needed for primary monitor
[5:28:41] snikiturtul: bandwidth is hella expensive true sandeep but that also depends on how one manages it Hm
[5:28:42] ItsTotallyNotaBot: @snikiturtul Also, real-time data streaming NODDERS
[5:28:44] mitakaskydiver: i honestly rarely have a stream over 720p, without fullscreen it really doesnt make a difference to me (im blind)
[5:28:46] Jet_Nos: Morning people just woke up 😴😴😴
[5:28:48] Raided: They are looking to move this transcoding to the streamer

[5:30:01] Ho_Lee_Sit: WAH
[5:30:11] Shade_B: @cluua_ twitch apps all suck. their streaming codecs are top tier tho
[5:30:11] Michael7461: Sadge
[5:30:21] anduadv: 1 bc streams video quality has gone down (constant laggy etc) twitch mobile has gone god awefull
[5:30:24] tripleduck: eh, idk 'bout that. being under amazon = having access to AWS for free.. just buffs the number of unique users on AWS and increases AWS's on paper value to investors. idk if there's that much of hardware costs
[5:30:26] trappedreality: any idea why they did that?
[5:30:31] baggjie: Was thinking Aiden, use to see hima lot around chats
[5:30:36] mynameisKUMAR: Aiden GIGACHAD
[5:30:38] M0hkofantti: Aiden is always on fanfans stream
[5:30:42] snikiturtul: also nvidia collab? KEKW they did one with my client and nvidia ended up being the one raking the profits from it KEKW
[5:30:43] s13epy: Aiden is a juicer?
[5:30:43] MidKnightRider: Aiden GIGACHAD
[5:30:46] KAP_out: bro twitch is owned by amazon, the service they use is also from amazon. when amazon wanted to they would just say that they dont charge twitch for the service and twitch would be the most profitable part of amazon. its all just an accounting trick @KristoferYee
[5:30:48] sxnchez: Drake Mr.Fossabot
[5:30:52] FreedomSock: Damn ads
[5:31:06] Shade_B: I need to get a job at Twitch to get a job at Kick

[5:31:14] TripMyWalker: But isnt kick using twitch servers too
[5:31:20] tripleduck: keep on reading
[5:31:32] s13epy: They get it a lower rate not free
[5:31:34] Shade_B: AWS business unit needs to profit too
[5:31:42] Lum_Lum103: Cheer100 Good morning Kris
[5:31:42] Fossabot: Lum_Lum103 just cheered 100 bits! HYPERS
[5:31:45] TheoDeu: that's not how expenses work tho
[5:31:46] Shade_B: its competitive as heck
[5:31:50] Raided: Amazon has to pay for it though OMEGALUL
[5:31:51] PastorCat: but its WAY cheaper then actually getting own AWS servers
[5:31:55] snikiturtul: @tripleduck amazon actually charges twitch more that they do their regualr customers KEKW
[5:32:02] mynameisKUMAR: No doesnt work like that
[5:32:03] tsurai: AWS still has insane running and maintenance costs
[5:32:05] shinkirro: maintaining servers is expensive too
[5:32:09] shrecky11: its called opportunity cost
[5:32:11] tripleduck: @snikiturtul "on paper"
[5:32:13] roaming____: It doesnt work like that
[5:32:17] SinfulThanos: It would put them in trouble when it comes down to auditing
[5:32:23] Manaron: twitch sucks so much, it's definitely not free for amazon
[5:32:27] Shade_B: it is all tracked, and whether or not there is profit is tracked, even if its all in books
[5:32:35] Manaron: sucks so much data*
[5:32:40] sandeep_bs: kris did ka or Christian yee get any reply from PD application Hmm
[5:32:40] snikiturtul: YEP duck, but those paper figures are what the stakeholders and regulators see and talk about
[5:32:40] Michael7461: LULW the programs for servers are like 500k- millions per year as well
[5:32:45] s13epy: @tripleduck we love tax cuts yeeBusiness yeeBusiness yeeBusiness yeeBusiness
[5:32:46] kevinth3panda: that’s how Enron kinda happened except with revenue instead of expenses om
[5:32:59] mitakaskydiver: 150 dollars to 200,000 dollars is quite a jump Kappa
[5:33:02] Pr0phetOG: Some housemates farmed a lot of wood last night and put it in the backyard of your house, since nobody had the new key, was all that wood still there today?
[5:33:05] Shade_B: always someone TIMES 200
[5:33:09] KAP_out: yes but they are a subsidiary so normally you wouldnt charge them listing price when you dont want them to fail and be in the red @KristoferYee
[5:33:11] MidKnightRider: Michael heyy
[5:33:19] Michael7461: heyy rider
[5:33:21] Raided: oooft
[5:33:26] jrsaywow: I can confirm this I've charged twitch separately from AWS and ABS separately.
[5:33:30] s13epy: @pr0phetog !meta
[5:33:30] tripleduck: @s13epy not tax cuts... those are from the charity feature twitch added smile . they get better figures to show stakeholders and future investors
[5:33:33] Michael7461: om
[5:33:38] KEMICALHAWK: om
[5:33:39] Steven_the_Wolverine: Twitch could also be a tax write-off. If it is taking a loss.
[5:33:45] sandeep_bs: kris is jay gonna vote for the mayor Hmm ?
[5:33:49] MidKnightRider: Raid shadow legends NOWAY
[5:33:50] tripleduck: @snikiturtul exactly what I meant with investors, just used the wrong word

[5:34:16] LamePuf: why not RAID its normal
[5:34:19] surelyURjokingMrFeynman: you don't use RAID to manage servers
[5:34:24] Shade_B: RAID makes sense
[5:34:24] FckngCrzy: lol sounds legit this is the 90s right?
[5:34:31] Shade_B: as part of the whole system
[5:34:36] snikiturtul: also there was a dev writeup on how prime video was managing its streaming and let's just say, their design decision made no sense and they absolutely deserved to lose money after processing each stream individually multiple times KEKW
[5:34:49] animeshuun: jesus 230billion
[5:34:51] Azhela: Creative Cloud is a massive money make
[5:34:55] LamePuf: wtf you mean all storage servers are using RAID
[5:34:55] snikiturtul: so it would not surprise me that twitch might also be doing things similarly
[5:35:01] Raided: Adobe cloud in the 90s OMEGADANCE
[5:35:02] surelyURjokingMrFeynman: you literally cannot manage a server with RAID I think you are just confused

[5:35:22] Shade_B: or big data file systems, but this is Adobe lets remember
[5:35:23] TripMyWalker: Most companies still use RAID cos its as is a hard disk
[5:35:24] Amuze586: huh? how much are rentals now?
[5:35:27] moistc: 16k with tax?
[5:35:31] SinsHD: @Amuze586 1k a day

[5:35:41] Amuze586: Holy shit
[5:35:52] Shade_B: RAID + HA + Load Balancer + ...
[5:35:57] M0hkofantti: 1k is crazy for car
[5:36:33] Capablist: peeps prolly already settled into their rp's
[5:36:33] snikiturtul: also kris, raid is for performance + replication, not for management Ok
[5:36:34] q1235a: Could have like 4k from gruber tbh
[5:36:40] anduadv: imagine renting bicycles next to car rental guy cathieKEKW
