[1:20:23] arcticpenguino: i think the easy way for them to understand is if these gangs get fed up with fixed distribution prices those said gangs will take you guys out of the business too
[1:20:23] SnowBouLe: then the gang needs to be ready for such an event then?
[1:20:23] ADAM1997__: uhnHead uhnHead uhnHead

[1:20:59] zachattack473: Imagine if Saab was also in this meeting

[1:21:21] wryinw: drugs =/= guns, don't necessarily want conflict
[1:21:21] SwiftLikeBuffalo: I feel like Siz is a customer service rep right now or some shit
[1:21:22] phongonqua: i feel like CB is assuming that gangs will buy into meth at that high set price even if their rep is down and siz is concerned about the possibility of them not buying in and meth market goes down the drain
[1:21:22] SGRokie: I think nino and crew just need to experience it first hand
[1:21:26] junglemints: !uptime

[1:21:45] The2b: Is Nino saying "They're going to go to jail, who cares if we set them up to go?" That's what I'm hearing...
[1:21:48] Caniteona: no one is gonna join in when they are gonna spend a week making loss and probably lose everything because someone else fucked up... they are being super greedy
[1:21:50] infectious37: some ppl want war.

[1:21:51] Jeffdog97: uhnHm lets put our greedy hands in the entire city and watch it burn itself and fuck everyone over. Forced RP for the win.

[1:21:53] xJager: I feel like this is going to continue till siz says cook your own shit
[1:21:54] TheSuperKingDan: tru
[1:21:54] Ned15: Speedy wouldn't lie , Don doesn't know
[1:21:54] DanoP_ttv: if you deal to more than one gang pull their supply if they start shit.
[1:21:56] watchSilently: TRUST
[1:21:56] Bombchuuu: speedy loyal NODDERS
[1:21:57] Cochinito98: This is such a fat meme
[1:21:57] sunbrewed: they're not seeing the difference between conflict naturally happening and being the literally conflict linchpin
[1:21:58] ka1o5: We trust Speedy 100%
[1:21:59] bmr236: Will siz have to split everything being sold three ways with Saab and Manny?
[1:22:00] Drax_1X: No, we're managing a monopoly TO MAKE FUCKING MONEY
[1:22:01] IPickRam: HE uhnDesk Doesn't uhnDesk listen uhnDesk
[1:22:02] Yeiveil: Speedy loyal
[1:22:03] CensoredTH0ughTs: what you going to do when they can't afford to buy your meth nino?
[1:22:04] Ned15: Speedy is loyal af
[1:22:04] Manzark: The only way I see this working is you need a guy to keep control of all these gangs to come from one group, building a proper hierarchy in the process rather than straight to then, need a connect, distro and under that distro is the gangs
[1:22:04] magicalcooki: theres a difference between micormanagmnt and active encouragment
[1:22:08] xPonder: aleksChuck
[1:22:13] LMGTNT: Cook with speedy uhnLol
[1:22:15] GrogRy3: uhnHm
[1:22:15] mitchgalaxies: i think he wants to know if the rep is individual or the whole gang
[1:22:16] naief001: I feel siz don't need the 2nd lab he have  everything he have the best quality
[1:22:19] SilverClassic: SilverClassic subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 20 months! Isn't it possible for the gangs to get angry at high prices, and they then don't let anyone sell in their spots.
[1:22:22] svartacus3000: but they're not a monopoly
[1:22:24] Div_the_Penguin: but would your product directly force them to fight if it's all same strain ??
[1:22:24] Br_aze: Please dude just leave lol this is hurting my head
[1:22:25] phongonqua: donnie doesn't know that siz and speedy go way back but the rest of them should know they roll deep
[1:22:27] Bombchuuu: uhnSiz Trust me uhnME
[1:22:27] skrranky: they are seeing themselves higher than the vagos not realizing they rely on them as much as the vagos needs them
[1:22:27] 420thMagicMan: Do they not know how vulnerable the meth labs r to attacks? If u strong arm them they can just steal the key
[1:22:28] xPonder: Joinks
[1:22:28] tinylilhearts: but Siz has a good relationship with Speedy, so does Buddha I dont get it
[1:22:29] leightones: so instead of trying to delay conflict, he wants to make it happen at fast as possible? where's businessman nino? KEKW
[1:22:29] Gizmopc: The SS gangs will just go to the 3rd lab
[1:22:30] Hazardousblitz: Deanbois trying to handle the streets AND selling to individuals/ groups?

[1:22:51] Goldfish_Vendor: thats why you sell bags based on teh effects
[1:22:53] Riazo_Yeen: pepeW
[1:22:53] CensoredTH0ughTs: so boatloads of meth beome one or two batches because they lost the steady income
[1:22:53] vanphie: they should just find out lol

[1:23:08] tinylilhearts: LUL just let them do their own thing

[1:23:18] Stephnoob: am i remembering wrong
[1:23:18] Ultimatestrife: but if they buy in person, they cant sell on the street level. buying for 600+ and selling on the street for 200+ ain't feasible
[1:23:19] stagnantt: not donnie Sadge
[1:23:21] toastandbutter: they don't know about the 100%
[1:23:32] 0xygenhomie: you fk over the vagos, theyll never let you sell at the barrio

[1:24:04] mangocubes_: isnt it the fact that the gangs after losing rep will just drop meth amf
[1:24:08] Coco2355: have i missed anything important
[1:24:09] Introvy18: It may just be me, but I just wanna see james be happy and laugh while playing games  uhnHm
[1:24:09] OriAirgid: I think the only reason to involve more people is if vagos can‚Äôt push as much as you supply
[1:24:19] Teger_1: gangs are gonna fight anyways, not over meth and the rep will get reset anyways
[1:24:20] Bombchuuu: @Coco2355 nope
[1:24:21] ADAM1997__: honestly we should just do solo and let them crash and burn
[1:24:23] ShadyPCE: 4v1 can Siz handle it LUL
[1:24:23] Figueronie: @Coco2355 no
[1:24:24] Meikai: What about the last key and lab? What if they sell shit to Speedy or to the people? Whole mess, going no where, circles circles.
[1:24:24] Veelox: They are being too greedy right now
[1:24:25] LijeBaley: @setaimata Thats why they need to work with them
[1:24:25] infectious37: we need 3 perfect strains for each gang before the 3rd lab gets theirs
[1:24:26] badazzguy: 
[1:24:27] PunkkRatt: I think they‚Äôre already dead set on their own plan tbh
[1:24:28] Devon4493: less reason for conflict
[1:24:35] mczagger: I think thats a good compromise
[1:24:36] spdivr1122: involving more people is such a bad call

[1:25:02] fotdaymon: We need don for more meetings
[1:25:05] lurkingby: The set rate is trash because If one person gets caught at the spot. The spot is unusable to everyone because of heat. Everyone will need to make back their rep at a new spot because of one fuck up. No one is going to be happy
[1:25:08] Scoobyk: the 2 strain also gives you the ability to cut off one of the gangs if you ever wanted

[1:25:59] CensoredTH0ughTs: LUL how long will that last?
[1:26:00] SnowBouLe: that's on them to handle these relations too
[1:26:01] meepmeep218: I think instead of thinking of having a flat rate for street level distribution as taking advantage of them, you should consider it as their form of 'R&D'. You sunk so much money into the cooking knowing it would make money later, so why shouldn't they?

[1:31:44] Ultimatestrife: just start somewhere and see what happens
[1:31:45] Div_the_Penguin: but does them having the same strain pushes them directly to fight over it ?

[1:31:52] Meikai: Donnys idea was good, to tell leaders not to fight or fuck up or they are done.
[1:31:53] nero_uchi: I think they didnt understand that if you push the same strain to the two groups they will fight over it. because they want the profit as well @UberHaxorNova

[1:32:14] slowChroma: Siz you are too nice
[1:32:15] K1NGJamezz: So if they push there own strain and it‚Äôs shit to grove street, and they find out vagos have 100% what‚Äôs to stop them from starting a gang war there. And both groups get fucked. If they both get the same strain with the rules they can‚Äôt fight, and that helps both gangs then it‚Äôs beneficial @uberhaxornova
[1:32:16] 420thMagicMan: If u create conflict among the gangs and make them mad they r more likely to attack the lab and steal the key
[1:32:16] Manzark: Everyone's worrying about distribution when we need to perfect the meth and figure out fees KEKW
[1:32:16] JoeKsova: @uberhaxornova you need to call donnie aside and have a separate convo with him
[1:32:18] dr_enthusiatick: I feel like pricing based off of the maximum would scare off a lot of potential buyers when they see the price, I just think it won't be worth their time

[1:32:28] toastandbutter: Pegasus was going to sell to people to use, Vagos was going to push at the spot
[1:32:29] evilcarryben: @UberHaxorNova youre capitalizing too much on gsf, cant they just sell on the north?
[1:32:29] jcomia1: i just dont know if the south side gangs want to buy back into meth if they fuck their own rep especially in the servers current economy

[1:36:54] behrok: @uberhaxornova wouldn‚Äôt helping the other guys create a profitable second strain and distributing to the other gang help insulate against conflict between them and increase profits?

[1:38:52] Endslikecrazy: it honestly seems like you need someone who's actually the boss behind it like otto/joe were and people were actually scared of them

[1:38:52] TheSoullessJoe: Why not have hoa push street level too?
[1:38:53] mangocubes_: this at the same time great rp and talking to a brick wall rp with these meth talks
[1:38:54] ka1o5: They do it to themselves too
[1:38:55] JungleG: I get what you're saying, but if the head of the gangs are aware that rep is important doesnt that give cause to stop beefing and its becomes their problem if they want to fuck up their own rep @UberHaxorNova
[1:38:55] sonkid343: Where are you OG?? Can i Come??? @UberHaxorNova
[1:38:56] tacobanesbutt: Secret Weapons
[1:38:57] Wimzzzyyyy: @UberHaxorNova I think you should start including donnie in when you meet with Nino because clearly there is some kind of disconnect between you and Nino
[1:38:57] istabyouwithbullets: MR J uhnGiga
[1:38:58] yespixelenthusiast: But thats why getting that 3rd lab is a top priority @UberHaxorNova
[1:38:59] ob4ke2k: Only tier 3 know the secret
[1:39:00] captain_froppy: So what you‚Äôre saying is, if they don‚Äôt get a meth charge on their record they don‚Äôt lose their rep ü§î
[1:39:00] UselessScrew: all the deer
[1:39:01] TakenSpace: CB cares about the money thats it lmao
[1:39:02] richiegreek_o: Deeeeeeeeeeer!
[1:39:04] bearrynice: thats if all the gangs work together n not buy it
[1:39:05] Corradoor: @UberHaxorNova To me it sounded like they were saying you are trying to control things out of your control that will happen regardless, but that secret info might be what's making this harder to understand for others
[1:39:06] thatssojohn: Flooding the market
[1:39:06] ANDRO_core: Yeah I feel like they wanna start it as if they're already big and powerful, they can do the flat rate once the power dynamic has been established but you should establish that good relationship first before putting your foot down @UberHaxorNova
[1:39:08] Thelazyplayer: yea but thats life: no is always an option
[1:39:09] GDAX: i guess buddha just wants the war rp
[1:39:10] arcticpenguino: @Bossostrich305 what if we sold the meta to the locals WICKED
[1:39:11] jcomia1: i feel like you just need to ease each group in and have set pushers from each that stay clean
[1:39:13] azizi64: this is great rp. stop hating on cb chat
[1:39:14] richiegreek_o: ya dont
[1:39:16] sahnteeno: Ultimately I think they‚Äôre gonna do their own thing and you‚Äôll do yours regardless
[1:39:17] Xantos94: the HOA?? yeah right LUL
[1:39:19] Kyndagh: @JungleG You hopping again? KEKW
[1:39:20] AmusingNotFunny: HOA gets into conflict, they get fucked
[1:39:21] Aha_McAco: HOA is a book club.
[1:39:22] Jeffdog97: alright guys let's regroup at tomorrow's meeting and have the exact same conversation Kappa
[1:39:23] nam_stex: nothing is stopping the vagos from retaliating and trying to take over a lab
[1:39:25] kingaroodle: i can see what nino and buddha are saying by trying to assert power but they think you're just being nice, they don't see the bigger picture
[1:39:26] Darthportius: HOA is part of the cooking team anyway,
[1:39:26] Nightbot: Check out D.R.E.A.M and their clothing! James has partnered with D.R.E.A.M to help support the Mental Health cause and to help you get some nice looking merch in the process. http://dreamsruleme.com/?afmc=1f
[1:39:26] Buldge: Yeah what if the gangs do just say no. They assume they have 100% leverage and the gangs cant say no. But they could and then you dont make any money.
[1:39:27] RomeoHC3: at the end of the day, Siz seems like the more trustworthy business partner with they way ur thinking
[1:39:28] Garuga1225: sorry to change the topic but are you getting the car before jesus goes to sleep?
[1:39:28] Tsorer: H OMEGALUL A

[1:39:33] FletchSin: the HOA pushing and not leaking it with their SBS? KEKW
[1:39:34] tolerance00: HOA = Good Gang
[1:39:34] Devon4493: makes more sense for south side gangs to do it down there
[1:39:35] kuydul: But eventually you could have 20 people at max rep rather than 5
[1:39:35] jamesqooq: and they are dumb :)
[1:39:35] uni0n1: calm down chat
[1:39:38] Skies_unknown4312: Anyways good news Stanley‚Äôs back!!!
[1:39:38] SNunez3: The sonora cartel stuff is the best meth rp.
[1:39:38] DanoP_ttv: what if you vagos cant move the volume?
[1:39:40] thatssojohn: You could make nino sign an NDA so that they can‚Äôt steal your intellectual property & assure them the recipe would be secure within HOA archives so that even if you go to jail the business won‚Äôt collapse
[1:39:41] Costedd: HOA Pushing Something KEKLEO
[1:39:41] jedimindtricks82k: Cheddar: pepeW hold my beer
[1:39:41] itzbeastnn: i think two strains gaining rep make sense
[1:39:41] 1stSWEETWIN: are you cooking today? uhnSip
[1:39:41] Pipopip1: cos you know they wont fuck thith anyone right ?
[1:39:41] xcrash283x: hoa is trying to push topshelf already anyway
[1:39:42] sunbrewed: If HOA needs money they have the top shelf anyways
[1:39:42] Ultra_A136: Jesus Sadge
[1:39:43] thetacticaljoe: I just seems to come down to whether or not the Vagos can push as much as you can make
[1:39:44] Jtengu: HOA pushes books, not drugs uhnKek
[1:39:44] basedgrandpa: @Buldge exactly
[1:39:44] ChunkyBrain: hoa in the SS LUL never again
[1:39:45] Kerkerino: because its your own group and free labor duh Pepega
[1:39:46] JungleG: @Waterseas lol i watch everyone stream sorry bud
[1:39:47] oHazen_: The other 3 that knows meth is Cheddar, Julio, and Kleb. Pretty sure they'll go to jail anyways LUL
[1:39:48] richiegreek_o: HOA is KING do t be so considerate to EVERYONE
[1:39:49] Pateef: @UberHaxorNova Do you believe that no southside gang would know about meth if you only pushed through Vagos?
[1:39:50] LacunoV: i think both ways work, in their own regard, one more than the other from person to person, and situation to situation. But Siz is more of a mutual beneficial person rather than a tyrant.
[1:39:53] eternalism93: Selling to more groups to push street level makes sense to maximize profit, but it also gonna have to maximize output of product which can also end up being an issue. I doubt anyone wants to spend even more time just cooking to push triple the product for greed
[1:39:53] 0xygenhomie: yep
[1:39:54] kura1kura: Let's not pretend like the HOA would constantly be in the Barrio selling meth KEKW
[1:39:54] ptsdtuna: fiona can beat mr k 1v1
[1:39:55] Meikai: CB wants instant money cuz they have so many mouth to feed with nerds cooking.
[1:39:55] Veineless: it comes down to the same thing, people will go to jail and rep will reset. Therefore if you work on a % basis you will make way less profit than setting a flat price and not caring about Rep as the supplier of the product
[1:39:56] DubiousDelirium: My Opinion in Chat: The Novel. uhnKek
[1:39:56] K1NGJamezz: Are there not multiple areas where groups can‚Äôt destroy each other‚Äôs rep? @uberhaxornova
[1:39:56] Gravydog: HOA would be too close to Siz, shouldnt risk it
[1:39:57] thrillious: I think the biggest concern with you trying try to put your thumb down is them deciding screw them lets take the lab and cook ourselves since they know how much they can make.
[1:39:58] ripefart: It‚Äôs just like Siz cares about rep friendships and money CB only money rn
[1:39:58] WickedTortuga: yuhhh
[1:39:58] VirtualKissland: tomorrows meeting is gonna be a recap chalupaKEK
[1:40:00] CakyCaktus: why does Siz need CB's co-operation?
[1:40:00] imdeatht1: people have forgotten about the Southside weed pushing already
[1:40:04] anxiouskita: i feel like theyre just behind by a month - there's a real experience gap
[1:40:05] ShowHatez: he wants to sell to the vagos capped, so if they fuck their rep, its not their problem
[1:40:06] richiegreek_o: use clean bois
[1:40:06] UnexistentUnderground: I think you've got the right mentality. You've established a core system, I wouldn't fuck with your crew until you see some organic growth
[1:40:07] sleepyotter: NODDERS

[1:40:18] slurbski: sounds like u need to part ways
[1:40:18] unusedboot: Speedy would probably want respect more than anything
[1:40:20] basedgrandpa: @UberHaxorNova you can treat them as a tool, just make sure you're treating those tools right
[1:40:21] ReAnalyze: but Bodda also in bed with Speedy
[1:40:22] Snigill: speedy is an uhnOG
[1:40:22] jridablo: why hoa not part of this anyway ain't that his gang?
[1:40:22] fdatvox: @nam_stex they think fucking over a SS gang has no repercussions LUL
[1:40:23] RezaQ8: Why would Speedy like it if he is just getting exploited
[1:40:23] Fort3: Sell higher to everyone other than Vagos so selling on the streets is not worth it for those people, that way they do not draw heat to the Vagos spot

[1:40:27] cwilce: How do you expect the vagos not to go to jail? They are robbing banks, getting in shootouts, and all sorts of other criminal stuff. The rep will reset all the time and nobody will make money. You cant just rely on vagos
[1:40:29] Veineless: because you have 2 of the 3 labs
[1:40:29] Actual_Nicotine: @Pateef of course they will and if they fight about it then it's organic, if we make it so the definitely all know then we force that conflict inorganically
[1:40:29] FringedWig46: exactly
[1:40:29] Vate: if it's possible for the people to keep their rep then what would be the problem if everyone is able to keep their rep?

[1:40:43] KingPresiden: @wilceee98, it doesn't matter because of meta he hasn't revealed
[1:40:44] rocket_s6: @UberHaxorNova what happens when the Vagos become obviously rich and powerful? Will the other gangs take that lying down?

You sell 24 bags to CG(?) for 14400-19200 when the likelihood of selling to a corner seller there's no way you'd get close to 600-800 per bag.

[2:09:01] beanie_: but with that logic then whats the issue with the cap? the cap doesn't have to be high
[2:09:03] bloodveinss: vagos fucking up nooo way

[2:09:07] oHazen_: Speedy and Buddha are homies so I was surprised
[2:09:08] ImRandell: lol
[2:09:10] 0xygenhomie: they dont want their bottom line affected by someone else basically
[2:09:11] devilGrinned: NODDERS yeah felt like they think they have to hold the vagos hand

[2:09:27] Psarthex: @UberHaxorNova You're too much of an idealist for them Sadge
[2:09:34] ANDRO_core: I think they're trying to build this business like they're already big and powerful when you're all just starting. A fixed price could be good once you guys get power way down the line but that trust needs to be established first @UberHaxorNova
[2:09:34] arielzhou99: maybe they have to treat it as an investment?
[2:09:35] easedel: And Nina and them just want a flat high rate regardless of their rep
[2:09:35] toriamu: the money comes from the rep NODDERS
[2:09:36] marcusi23: i think its going out 1 ear out the other for some though
[2:09:36] FletchSin: I think most people are confused and won't understand until they see it happen, I feel
[2:09:37] mu_sei: they probably just think they can move more product by selling to multiple gangs
[2:09:41] boszisza: they just wanna cook and sell, dont wannta care at all.. they handling like 2.0 .. =/
[2:09:44] GrogRy3: however it works out these mechanics make for some good conversations
[2:09:45] anjellyca: might be bc they dont know what you know about protecting the sellers reputation
[2:09:48] ImRandell: The Top Shelf Car... sell top shelf out of the van lmao
[2:09:49] Devon4493: they think that saying you can make this much is encetive enough but i dunno if it will

[2:10:06] ka1o5: A vriefing
[2:10:09] Corradoor: @uberhaxornova maybe nino's idea is that they already made a bunch of money at the cap and use saved money to rebuild back up
[2:10:10] B1gwile: go get a custom plate lol
[2:10:11] Bombchuuu: mmmm oPeepo Paragraphs
[2:10:12] NegativeCapable: time to sell the key KEKW
[2:10:12] toadloadmodechode: @filican606 yea the issue right now is it seems like one packet has the information required written to it but it is ignored so I gotta figure out if I can catch it,

[2:10:15] PanadaTM: paragraph posers in chat pepeW

[2:10:20] MoistWetWipe: I trust uhnOG
[2:10:21] ArJayHeart: need the feedback in case things change
[2:10:22] CrazedLover: doing your plan are there going to be two gangs? if not wouldnt  two gang make more money even if it is more risky? @uberhaxornova
[2:10:22] LacunoV: And thats what CB doesn't understand is what chat is saying maybe
[2:10:23] mach1tugboat: You don't get to be the coke kingpin without understanding how the gangs work NODDERS
[2:10:26] Fort3: If people are buying to sell on the streets you won't be able to rip them off. If you do, you're going to get ratted on
[2:10:27] glasses_Blac: uhnOG uhnOG uhnOG uhnOG uhnOG
[2:10:30] 0xygenhomie: theyre hyper focused on their bottom line, siz might need to coax them a little
[2:10:30] hippies123: That's why Siz is the real uhnOG
[2:10:31] reneeanastacio00: I trust uhnOG
[2:10:32] bloodveinss: soon vagos be in super cars when the lie to siz
[2:10:33] beanie_: You don't have to set the cap that high though?
[2:10:34] toadloadmodechode: @filican606 likely on the port side of the code, where the packets get received NODDERS
[2:10:37] CensoredTH0ughTs: it a completely new system that neeeds to be figured out
[2:10:38] crabholecompetition: does siz know who has the third lab chat?
[2:10:38] FletchSin: @Quintessential_Bulbasaur hihi! hru?!?! o/
[2:10:40] Seiggray: yeh why would a gang buy the meth for a fixed price whrn they don't even have a rep to start making profit
[2:10:44] Eredin: I think people for some reason think people need to sell the meth, if you have a high fixed price and it becomes not worth it, they can just say screw it
[2:10:44] Tru7hyDv8: nino doesn't know product is viable for consumption either ?.... that would explain the concern about only going to vagos
[2:10:44] KingPresiden: @crabholecompetition, no
[2:10:45] StarDecima: think of it like a game mechanic chat, because it is
[2:10:48] dav_the_hat_man: I mean what about new people coming in with their set price idea? You got people who've never sold coming in and buying say 100 bags for 10k, and by the end they only make 6k, like why would they buy another shipment if they don't know if they'll make a profit the next time with the rep.
[2:10:48] un_noiire: i just let uhnOG plays how he wants NODDERS
[2:10:49] filican606: @toadloadmodechode saiiDERP
[2:10:49] marvin1of1: They won‚Äôt understand until they see themselves. Speed running to drawing attention
[2:10:54] DLan19: They don't want to adjust for the vagos but they wanted the vagos to adjust to them
[2:11:02] thatssojohn: It‚Äôs that you‚Äôre focusing on more than just production, but distribution & logistics
[2:11:03] toadloadmodechode: @mega_monkey_mike it would be lucky.. if it wasn't with my own money Sadge
[2:11:03] hippies123: Siz is the Walter White... everyone else got reckless Jesse mimdset
[2:11:04] easedel: The van needs a custom plate.... METHMAN Kappa
[2:11:10] toadloadmodechode: @FletchSin sup Fletch! peepoHey
[2:11:10] Actual_Nicotine: @beanie_ a midground fixed price might work. I think CB were saying they want to fix it at the cap (the highest possible potential price)

[2:11:58] KingPresiden: @mlbrummett, I don't think it'd be the same for individuals and if it'd be a completely different gang then they'd have to go with the two strain idea

[2:12:30] filican606: @ztarb0y, thats asking a child not to steal another chils toy uhnLol
[2:12:31] dav_the_hat_man: I just mean with CB's idea Presiden, they want to sell at a set price regardless of who buys it and when, if you're a new party you won't make a profit
[2:12:32] rampaige_x: the thing that i find crazy is, the fact that you have been telling them how it is then they dont listen, then come back to you with the same shit you tell them and act surprise that it didnt work. same shit will happen with thisplan they have

[2:33:11] Doxe_de_Bohemia: @UberHaxorNova I am wondering, back when you had the coke whitelist, you "complained" or whatever about coke not having enough of a process to it. Now that coke is gone and you have this shit show on your hands, with CB just in it for money and random parties able to join in whenever a key is lost, do you wish you would just get the whitelist back? Is the whole meth cooking process too much of a process or is it what you wanted? Thanks for coming to my TED talk chat.

[5:43:13] cellojakers: @uberhaxornova was donnies plan for you to cook some in their lab and them to also cook a second strain?
[5:43:14] Kappsule: and you get them as protection also @UberHaxorNova
[5:43:16] Naixoram: Like that one guy said, everyone is trying to look out for the curve ball so they can't see the straight ball coming
[5:43:23] kura1kura: if Siz wanted to dick people over, wtf is the point of sharing info?
[5:43:24] ubermorph1000: my strimmer mus win
[5:43:29] xanetrose: i think the pricing stuff is just not knowing all the info yet

[5:43:30] UselessScrew: dangerous road tho
[5:43:34] jedimindtricks82k: PepeLaugh i mean, if the 27th message wasnt delivered properly must be something wrong between the sender-messenger-receptor
[5:43:38] SNunez3: Yup
[5:43:38] Strikerpxs: I think both parties collaborating and having two strains that can reach 100% and then just being tactical about managing rep makes a lot of sense

[5:44:19] space_is_a_lie__: they are sus on your dedication to the vagos and not just producing the product and selling it at market price
[5:44:19] Actual_Nicotine: @hasanoo5 speedy isn't the only one selling in Vagos. He is the one giving data and keeping his rep high. He has others selling but he's the kingpin with the highest rep
[5:44:21] Validante: @UberHaxorNova 2 strains would mean that both have to be equal quality. meaning youd have you give out slider info. right?

[5:51:19] Creazelee: @UberHaxorNova Yeah it seems like they just want to push it out and wash their hands of it.

[5:51:33] 420thMagicMan: Vinny never gave details about his coke
[5:51:33] Ultimatestrife: poor speedy didn't get his farm, either. he deserves this
[5:51:35] audialAurora: Vagos only have one de facto leader. Easier to control the direction of this kind of shit when there's only one El Jeffe.
[5:51:38] killercam22: nino also doesnt realize if you dick over the vagos they can just lock down the corners and you cant sell to anyone
[5:51:39] ItsCookedCookie: have to expressed that to nino?
[5:51:40] Wiggly_Mew: @hmongbeast was vu removed because of twitch tos?

[5:52:02] A_DeviousHawk: You did tell him you were in it for the Information
[5:52:02] crabholecompetition: people use southside as an insult, i dont like that
[5:52:08] Luthercorpz: Yupp
[5:52:09] Tuckerbonage: @uberhaxornova i guess thats why you had 5mil and nino was kinda broke near the tail end of 2.0 uhnKek
[5:52:10] imdeatht1: Making sure people make money creeates job security for the cooks
[5:52:11] kura1kura: NOPERS No Paragraph Ted Talks pls NOPERS
[5:52:14] AYO_jun: Sounds like they want to push it to all the gangs to potentially 3-5x the money
[5:52:18] bluunova_: things change NODDERS
[5:52:19] hasanoo5: true
[5:52:20] BobRossSaladToss: NODDERS
[5:52:22] HmongBeast: @Archiux Most likely but it's gonna be revamped to be more TOS Friendly
[5:52:29] 80b101: Thats how siz control coke market in 2.0 too NODDERS
[5:52:37] Ultimatestrife: @thegaffer88 Siz trusts speedy more than Nino and lang, ironic sin e speedy would probably choose them over Siz
[5:52:38] one_ox: no point being a cook if the business crumbles on the outside
[5:52:40] space_is_a_lie__: It just seems all these talks are endgame when everything is still in beta
[5:52:42] jaymerka: It sounds like James is teaching us LOL
[5:52:44] Luthercorpz: Siz is 100% right on this I feel.
[5:52:46] LijeBaley: @ayo_jun And it won't work uhnKek
[5:52:46] SquattingCoyote: How does meth compare to donuts though? Is it still not terminator status?
[5:52:47] Wiggly_Mew: @hmongbeast oh good. definitely need stuff to do in that area
[5:52:49] hasanoo5: or even how much purity would be good for locals and how much for players
[5:52:51] ChimPumPauluz: uhnHm uhnNotes
[5:52:54] Mysteryhue: i feel like Nino is just ready to sell it and make profit, while you are still on RnD
[5:52:56] CruelFives: It's like Walter White wanting to just cook and then wanting some control over the distribution
[5:52:57] EvidentGhost: they're not gonna buy 100% purity if they're not making profit NODDERS
[5:52:57] OdinGodOfVictory: I was watching Speedys stream they loved it good RP plus they don't own a single house n they were all chilling at the Barrio looking out and protecting the spot
[5:52:58] b_arrlos: at this point it's less way of a headache to just keep them as separate operations
[5:53:00] esrou: Information is power. money is just a byproduct
[5:53:04] vlICHAOSIlv: fantastic points for sure
[5:53:08] LijeBaley: @squattingcoyote Watch the last vods to find out ;)
[5:53:10] Rooberz27: All this business talk just goes over my head, I just NODDERS to everything
[5:53:21] SaucyAvA: Dont you have people to find that out for you? Why does it have to be you in person? @UberHaxorNova
[5:53:21] Actual_Nicotine: @Ultimatestrife no way. Siz was his second in command, and Nino and Lang are the ones pushing that Speedy is unreliable. Siz and Speedy are tight as
[5:53:30] n7merc18: of course the cook wants to know how his product is doing lol

[7:11:57] foreverkobe24: and on 84 pct rn
[7:11:58] Hento: HOA might be cook protection
[7:12:01] nst420: yeah cb themself dont care about the money
[7:12:01] Strikerpxs: just murder all of CB
[7:12:04] E_v_olution: after one full day of selling too, pretty crazy
[7:12:05] Actual_Nicotine: @poopado imo he needs to not worry about trying to push the nerds into shit, they're having fun at RR, I get he feels they're bored, but I don't think they are
[7:12:08] CrYyPtiD: Its more about cohesion then profit
[7:12:09] kotulakk: @brittanywittany if my math checks out 100 is currently 643

[7:12:12] stelexx0: so do cops get pings from this?
[7:12:12] Semsis924: @uberhaxornova are you ok with Lang‚Äôs nerds doing the cooking after you setup the laptop?
[7:12:12] YewFancy: Seems like it‚Äôs top up in the cb op vs bottom up in this one
[7:12:14] Ultimatestrife: James can you try selling one?
[7:12:16] Dopp: Yeah, and the cost to get the rep he's at right now is a crazy cost for CB to front with their strain, or the third lab

[7:12:39] ColdDeck45: CB ADHD will be the death of them. Not sure about this other group either but unless they see the vision and give it dedication they'll be too far behind in the game.
[7:12:43] pengun3: @lemineraz That was the plan

[7:12:50] kotulakk: @Dopp i mean the 3rd lab showed you can just offer to a group to cover cost
[7:12:51] Riuzaku: @strikerpxs, it would just be endless war which is just horrible boring RP after a while

[7:13:02] SacredAngelCake: if the prices of meth batches are consistent, it will be a super stable business. the other businesses in the city don't have consistent income like meth.
[7:13:03] TheGlobGoblin: @UberHaxorNova Have you tried tea or moonshine with it?
[7:13:04] JungleG: @j_davis08 you underestimate how much buddha loves those nerds, he cut the prices off everything at roosters just so they coudl all max out on receipts and in term he makes basically no money and he's the owner

[9:51:45] Syntag: @Olacarn Ah yeah thanks for being actually helpful here and responding. I know it's RP which is why I was curious why they didn't shoot after a certain threshold. RP in mind, I would think that it would make sense to start considering shooting when there's a minimum of 3 close escape encounters. But I see how that can be overpowering now. I know summit got shot sooner than this threshold in one of the streams I watch, which made me curious how that all works
