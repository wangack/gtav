[2:06:45] KermzyQ: You have up to 3 months to get the 2nd shot @AndyMilonakis
[2:06:45] wayne_desh: yes
[2:06:46] Skaftoise: Yikes
[2:06:50] SweatfootMcGhee: I haven't heard that. Doesn't sound optimal...
[2:06:51] DudeItsJonas: It's because of their supply
[2:06:53] saprobate: there's an optimal range but they just can't get the shots to people in the optimal range
[2:06:53] TommyTerrible: wtf
[2:06:53] the1adydeath: i thought it was 4 weeks  hmmm
[2:06:54] largefromage: WHAT
[2:06:54] Shovelpile: might be supply issue not optimal wait time?

[2:07:04] the1adydeath: i had to get my second at 4 weeks
[2:07:05] toto9001: all vaccines need sceond shot but the russian one not?!
[2:07:05] ennuihenry: @CodingPandas some states have tiers where people under 66 can get the vaccine
[2:07:05] heyborderlinepodcastman: rna vaccine? lol
[2:07:05] uq_nation: i already got mine working in healthcare and its like 3 weeks
[2:07:09] azza0023: Had my first jab 3 weeks ago
[2:07:15] DudeItsJonas: Optimal wait time is 3 weeks. Anything longer is due to government intervention.
[2:07:16] BOFORS: the more people that get the first shot the better
[2:07:18] CashMeow: There os also testing going on with mixing and matching Pfizer first Moderna second and the potential efficacy going up

[2:07:53] wave_jumper: the logic is they want more people with some protection, not less people with more protection
[2:07:53] KermzyQ: Unfortunately Quebec fucked up in that aspect. They got a mass amount of the first vaccine, but not enough of the 2nd and they're not sure they'll get them within 3 months
[2:07:54] CashMeow: I think UK is leading that mixing and matching vaccine stuff
[2:07:59] mikeman617: I used to know this russian chick Ivanka Kutcher Kokov
