[4:53:30] someonecreepin: maby they were connected to the desk not hdd
[4:53:31] Ninnoss: New pc you have to link rack again
[4:53:32] Jitheneccl: True - Racks linked to PC not HDD
[4:53:32] void5678: It has the app but it's not linked

[4:53:36] digital0smosis: The apps moved but linked racks didn't
[4:53:36] piethonic: the links would be physical so it makes sense to connect to the desk @Ray__C
[4:53:40] devalor2114: Had app but you reset it by removing it to diff pc @ray__c

[4:53:47] IwasKira: no
[4:53:48] miagiii_: scuff unlocked
[4:53:48] itsKiruki: it had the app when you moved, but no way to link or re-link the racks
[4:53:49] ja90c: you plug it into the computer surley
[4:53:50] qHaydos: devs should just make it auto unlink
[4:53:51] void5678: It's not link on the ract though
[4:53:54] qHaydos: and become an option
[4:53:55] tarm38: wouldn't there be capbling connecting the racks to the pc? maybe you need to disconnect and reconnect them in the app too

[4:54:52] forr34: oh my god there are loads of monitors that are fused with the walls @Ray__C FIX IT PLEASEEEEE
[4:54:53] skedaddelr: probably hard to code a link between a placed object and an item that you can have in your bag so makes sense they would have to link 1 object to another
[4:54:55] Kyrilxd: I thought racks are supposed to be linked to Computer desk and not hard drives @Ray__C
[4:54:56] Rohanone1: 7 k rolls in pockets

[5:17:26] TheOnlyWay029: having no blueprints cancels it no?
[5:17:31] SmiTeGuru6: I dont understand why the compnay doesn't put the big 6060 gpu in the PCs for 2 output instead of the .4
[5:17:31] theoutcastboi: I think they have four racks - given the coin generation rate, they're only a tiny bit behind - either group could be the first to do the robberies.
[5:17:33] TheOnlyWay029: so just remove the blueprints

Not a single country in the world is named Britain. Some people say they come from England, and England is inside Britain, but if that was the case they would be British they would be Englanders. Also, heard some silly theories about them coming from whales. Guys, no, whale people do not exist. Whales live in the sea.

[18:57:25] n9bulaa: You notice a wall of text in twitch chat and your hand instinctively goes to the mouse. You scroll up to stop the chat elevator and read the pasta, indulging in its delights... You soon realize that this pasta conveys no information nor is particularly witty or funny. Nevertheless, you drag your mouse across, hit Ctrl+C, then Ctrl+V and press Enter
