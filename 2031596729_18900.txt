[5:51:21] b_mitch123: I can give some recommendations if u like based on what Leslie did?
[5:51:22] treasurelittlebun: maybe hair first? Is it possible?
[5:51:35] probablymonica: i'm assuming face one is what really shapes the face. Hmm
[5:51:38] smokeap0ttamus: face one and two are like choosing parents faces if that helps

[7:24:46] literallyjustisaac: its ok, even leslie started off not too good

[7:24:58] yogi201672: @xChocoBars do you have prio or no?
[7:25:01] littlestblob: OK
[7:25:02] Snapfarr: As long as you avoid using knowledge your character doesn't know, you'll be so fine. It's just about going with the flow, you know?
[7:25:03] vvickyyy__: you should watch some April being April videos, that might help you to understand April and get comfortable with the banter
[7:25:04] dlowhite: yeah the screen that says dont show
[7:25:06] Binnbe: you will be with friends
[7:25:08] JustJet_o7: that just the website connect screen
[7:25:09] chowi6: there are details that u can know, i wish you a good time in rp @xchocobars
[7:25:11] chase_skodje: you should steal tanner from april!
[7:25:13] Aiden: you can show the fivem lobby page, not the browser page
[7:25:15] smokeap0ttamus: X leaks everyday
[7:25:21] Cuco: That’s an example of the dangers with chat during RP. People will backseat you to unhealthy degrees
[7:25:21] JustJet_o7: you can show the fiveM screen
[7:25:22] anandm972: updating Beta Ig
[7:25:24] Creeper_USA: you can show now'

[7:25:26] Frozen_yakman: loading into NoPixel or ONX takes forever
[7:25:26] tatihaq: I think for family lore it's not really meta since it's your family history, maybe certain events that happened in Los Santos could be considered meta
[7:25:28] itz_Candyman: You can show the queue and the loading screen, just not the page when you connect
[7:25:31] alyberry4: you can show connecting just not the website
[7:25:36] iikakkashii: it’s not even a leak tho ??? isn’t the server open to anyone tho

[7:25:43] simisim05: Yeah watching some April clips might help understand her character lol
[7:25:44] silverslash_: Yep
[7:25:45] missfonts: you'll do well, it's alright. they can guide you. rule of thumb, just have the mods block meta gamers. sometimes they say where certain characters are, what kind of characters are they, things like that
[7:25:45] Twincy_N: YEP
[7:25:46] p__dragon: beware of meta and backseating chat hoppers, you’ll deal with them eventually
[7:25:46] alyberry4: yes
[7:25:46] Aiden: yeah nothing really leaks but just don’t show the website page, fivem menu is fine

[7:26:17] joeytigger007: She really is a walking Red flag
[7:26:21] raquel_d_: JAN JAN YOU ARE SO PRETTY

[7:42:53] ramjayar: yessss
[7:42:56] enchantedowl_: Yeah that works
[7:42:58] Electrolover1336: Yeah wouldn't it be very good for your character to role in to town with some friends and still look up to April? And yes, stick to one character, why not?
[7:42:58] chase_skodje: it does not mean that she can't to friends
[7:42:59] etav04: Do original character pld

[7:43:01] dlowhite: Celine and Eva can be January's friends
[7:43:02] itz_Candyman: You can still be friends with their characters lol
[7:43:03] RashieG: January can be friends with them though :) doesn’t need to always be with April
[7:43:04] drewwy_hey: but you can make a new one
[7:43:05] smug1ne: you can make more than one character  ... if ya want to
[7:43:06] sailorbren: that's fine your nickname can be janjan
[7:43:07] aldentenoodles3: can they be your HS friends ?
[7:43:10] jiminly25: chat gave you wrong face
[7:43:13] probablymonica: can also spawn january and work on her later in game if u want
[7:43:15] sweetpotot: i think its a good character and it can go however you want
[7:43:15] Shin_Kuro__: Yeah january fooze can have her own story and be april's sister
[7:43:15] MangoSrh: is there a way to watch the vod?
[7:43:16] audreyarrz: January has her own life methinks
[7:43:19] llovebri: do January it’s so funny😂😂
[7:43:19] chase_skodje: january is perfect for you!
[7:43:20] thomas122: what happened? i thought she been created her character?
[7:43:23] energycapt: well since your starting with friends you can postpone january fooze
[7:43:23] simisim05: You can have whatever lore you want!
[7:43:24] neelerita: like what celine's saying is maybe in the future you dont want to be that tightly connected to april
[7:43:32] arizuniga: you can always make another character if you want but now it is best to stick as 1
[7:43:32] david199915: Sideview
[7:43:32] cozydarling: ellum has two characters, he uses his 2nd one Eli more now
[7:43:35] mcmay25: yeah you're not required to hang out with your siblings
[7:43:37] tamamluv: making another one is too much especially if you just started
[7:43:39] enchantedowl_: You can have instant friends and rp it out
[7:43:41] alwaysinspire: January can have her own friends too. it's whatever you want and makes you comfy <3
[7:43:44] daisygodoy: why she lowkey look like Taylor swift
[7:43:47] sweetpotot: it will be a lot of grinding for just one character, i think two will be too stressful
[7:43:49] chase_skodje: @cozydarling he does!? i only know eli lol
[7:43:51] DaisyMJ22: kkatamSad the DC was unfortunate
[7:43:56] JigenKing: watch the vod
[7:43:57] CaptainQuartz: Janny short for January would be a cute nickname peepoSitL
[7:43:57] raquel_d_: we need vod watcher
[7:43:58] brunettecat_: ill gobaack in the vod
[7:44:00] treasurelittlebun: I think its 33 for face 1 too
[7:44:00] sailorbren: i think its perf since you can nickname yourself janjan
[7:44:03] junoluite: @daisygodoy i see it LUL
[7:44:04] MissDarkling: i think face 1 was 33
[7:44:04] MangoSrh: is there a way to watch the vod
[7:44:04] aldentenoodles3: is there someone you can contact?
[7:44:05] davenerys: if you restart stream we can access VODs
[7:44:07] duckguytodd: well the nice thing is that all the foozlers have very different backgrounds so she could have her own lore too
[7:44:07] JustJet_o7: sisters look alike right?
[7:44:07] kaiiizen72: ayo why does she kinda look like taylor swift KEKW
[7:44:08] Darkassassin791: chat = cringe
[7:44:09] itzliiza: its the face 27 thats throwing everything off
[7:44:11] single_index_finger: as a very new rper it’s probably best to only have one character
[7:44:13] audreyarrz: any vod watchers?
[7:44:14] Omega9000_: Wait what? Use the settings that suits you
[7:44:14] smug1ne: she still looks good --- April had extensive surgery, so they don't need to look alike
[7:44:16] Benokiii_: we'll watch, wait hihi
[7:44:16] lavidiaa: can you see the vod?
[7:44:17] CrownedQLiz: try face 1 33
[7:44:18] itsRyanHiga: Omg you actually made a fooze? I was jk
[7:44:18] rosiexv_: vods are available!
[7:44:18] MzAnneThropy: I would argue having a sibling can be a good entry point, no one says she has to stick to April, like Ray and Yuno, she can have her own sepparate story
[7:44:20] GoodLordInSpace: dev can recover, not sure how long it will take tho
[7:44:22] mrkmattos: @davenerys she doesn't have to restart stream to do this
[7:44:23] dinkbee: wait why would ppl do that that’s messed up
[7:44:23] ReplicantHaRi: kkatamSad
[7:44:23] david199915: Just fix the face again lmao

[7:44:32] kingslayerjai: Ryannnn
[7:44:33] beawbeawgaming: Hai Ryan <3
[7:44:33] tatihaq: I went back in the vod but could only see face one and three, 1=33 and 3=45
[7:44:35] Stormi_Kitty: skin 1 is 33
[7:44:35] rosiexv_: go to videos and there is last one
[7:44:36] treasurelittlebun: 33 for face 1
[7:44:37] RashieG: Hi Ryan!
[7:44:39] dlowhite: o7
[7:44:41] Spacegamer1252: @Darkassassin791 your welcome to go watch another stream
[7:44:41] Stormi_Kitty: 33 face 1

[8:03:07] panicIK: Most arms are normally 15 - or less

[8:03:26] moon_jt: Mask get rid off kiki face
[8:03:26] MzAnneThropy: when there are many players around your face will distort and you'll need to put on a mask to fix it

[8:03:32] BabylonHunter: @MicahSeeks NotLikeThis
[8:03:33] Shin_Kuro__: Oh somtimes the game bugs your face and you use a mask to refresh it

[8:03:42] farkasaurus: its a server lag issue
[8:03:43] ninnaaa: kiki face= bugged . so ppl get face mask to fix it
[8:03:43] fernpanda: putting on and taking off a mask fixes glitch

[8:03:59] MzAnneThropy: you can take it on and off at will
[8:03:59] klaviland: u can do it later
[8:04:02] JackTFarmer: Your face can glitch to default, but using a mask shortly reloads your own custom face
[8:04:06] absurdasparagus: yeah u can just ad one now and take it off when ever
[8:04:06] cheesemoonlight: this shirt might be glitched

[8:04:56] jjjacqulinnn: change the arms to ones with just hands
[8:04:58] aldentenoodles3: change arms/undershirt
[8:04:59] MangoSrh: I like the 1st the best
[8:05:00] Melllllooowww: arms to 4 might fix it
[8:05:00] Crylching: just the arms and neck
[8:05:00] sylvee88: shirts at the bottom are cuter!
[8:05:00] smug1ne: hey looks just like before
