[0:50:13] ViceroyStark: Haters are easy to spot these days man. People just don't understand RP.
[0:50:31] netflixankill_: I think the grinding is super necessary because there’s no point everyone getting to the end goal within a week of playing because that’s not fun. It’s kind of like how people buy tears in battle passes. You take the fun out of grinding LOL

[0:53:38] Ragnogh: I am going to be honest I have loved the pacing of 4.0 way more than 3.0. 3.0 felt like rush to do big job and then go to war. Rinse and repeat.

[0:55:34] KrisCat: @Aumilly hard to explain the appeal of watching ppl RP in a videogame sometimes lol
[0:55:36] adamjacklaw: I think naturally the longer servers go on the more they become cops & Robbers, fresh start like this is so great to see more about the characters and RP opportunities

[0:55:42] SailorWS: Idk if felt like explosives and other high end stuff became way too abundant towards the end. Seeing people just toss bombs at each other for fun was nuts

[12:42:40] bruhrito5: Today we lost a friend. Not only a friend, but a king. He helped us through our darkest moments, led us through every trial we faced, and was there to enjoy with us the times that weren’t so bad. Not a day goes by that I don’t think about him. The day he died, he shook the earth, and the whole world became one in their mourning. It is important to remember this day, not to mourn, but to be happy. Rip Land Buddha

[13:06:45] G1ZONE: @fambaa Leng didn’t see x! x was hidden behind the wall
[13:06:47] jesscdcc: @eiyzen i mean noone knows he wasnt streaming so cant tell
[13:07:17] yaboizelda: lang called Harry and said he saw X but didn’t wanna shoot to alert cops
[13:07:19] eiyzen: yeah idk maybe a cop perspective? just curious

[13:07:53] DEagleEye: @eiyzen only one who saw him was x when he shot him, all x saw was lang stumble, no other view
[13:07:57] Conf1gs: @eiyzen he was streaming on kick lol
[13:07:57] yaboizelda: lang said he saw X flanking he just didn’t wanna shoot 4-5 cops were near him under him

[13:08:51] Dythronix: Why was I under the impression that it only went to 200 stars?
[13:08:52] zandrusz: @yaboizelda that probably saved him a felony and 30k fine LUL
[13:08:53] eiyzen: ohh did you see it? @conf1gs
[13:08:57] difficultsleep3r: They should add an auto back up for phones.
[13:08:59] medium_5: Yeah Lang dropped the ball hard tbh, was a super good ambush, if he just had waited to see who had the gun and take him out they would have come out on top
[13:09:01] DEagleEye: @conf1gs he wasnt buddhas been offline for a few hours
[13:09:02] Conf1gs: @eiyzen yes

[13:09:20] yaboizelda: @zandrusz fr why shoot and get fined with 6 cops under you
[13:09:21] itslay_2: What happens at 300 gold stars?
[13:09:26] eiyzen: @conf1gs did lang make it out or was he downed from getting shot
