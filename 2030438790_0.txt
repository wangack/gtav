This includes telling where other characters are and what they have done or are doing. tiny.cc/metagaming
[5:12:45] ozokar: what are you waiting for with the cout case?
[5:13:12] muffinplaysgames: T2 got buffed by the way xD its fast now

[5:20:13] sandeep_bs: Paseoo Susge go to sleep
[5:20:36] tripleduck: Hmm do you think that having phone numbers bound to sim cards (as objects) is a bad move? could someone break the server by buying more phone numbers than can exist?
[5:21:18] Braddleborn: I mean, if the judge isnt doing their job like what you said isnt that grounds to be like, reprimanded or something
[5:21:35] kelpklepto: that's why murphy was actually happy when he had those crazy things  happen to him last week
