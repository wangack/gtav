[2:57:46] YurdleTheTurtle: @seaslimes Siz recently backed out because 'HOA' was progressing faster on their end, and wanted to buy their own house outright instead of share. Zero was super disappointed in the news but later called and said "it's all good", which HOA was suspicious of. There was supposed to be a meeting with lumber union but it has yet to happen, might happen soon.
