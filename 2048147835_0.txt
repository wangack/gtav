[2:03:02] NemisizZ: ngl, u should put a rack up in ur apartment so u can make a little on the side
[2:03:37] thajollypirate: ^
[2:03:43] ky05uk3: yeah apartment airflow/humidity tests in the apt

[2:03:46] AdanTheEpiphany: @NemisizZ wait are they not paying him for the weed?
[2:04:02] legoliket: Yeah I think u need way more fans/vent and humidifiers

[2:07:08] ky05uk3: 390?
[2:07:11] scha_de: 200 each for fert+seeds
[2:07:12] spoonfullofMusic: didn't you spend money on racks and the house as well?
[2:07:21] NemisizZ: what do you need to grow 1 plant
[2:07:26] scha_de: oh wait the tax
[2:07:28] Nexidir: self scam
[2:07:46] MarkFoxinator: mcretIQ
[2:07:46] spoonfullofMusic: yeah so even if you get 400 a brick you make 0 money cause you spend that on food KEKW
[2:07:47] NemisizZ: oof
[2:07:57] Fishnet83: you gotta charge more than 400 from the crew then KEKW
[2:08:07] AdanTheEpiphany: @spoonfullofMusic i feel like he should get 700ish
[2:08:11] Suvaacc: i still think best option would be to buy safe and put cash in there every week and you can take payment from there
[2:08:24] spoonfullofMusic: hes working for free KEKW
[2:08:26] scha_de: 100+100+(100/3 water use)+(100/pesticide use) * 1.15 = cost
[2:09:01] scha_de: oh I dont know
[2:09:03] legoliket: Goods is 30% ye
[2:09:05] scha_de: Shruge
[2:09:16] ky05uk3: so 130 for a seed water fert and pesticide?
[2:09:23] Suvaacc: yeah ask at least 600 a brick, they will literally make over 1200 the more their turf rep increases
[2:09:38] spoonfullofMusic: + 3 or 4 days of drying, so you only lose money
[2:09:53] ky05uk3: @Suvaacc assuming the person selling has 100 rep
[2:10:13] legoliket: They already make 1200 per brick base and it will only increase now when u have a strain so 600 would make sense
[2:10:16] 1evilshark: you could ask your partner grower for info
[2:10:17] Suvaacc: @ky05uk3 you cant sell on turf without 100 weed rep
[2:10:25] onix146: ky05uk3 if they aren't 100 it's their problem Shruge
[2:10:35] ky05uk3: @Suvaacc half the sellers in the group arent 100 though
[2:10:50] AdanTheEpiphany: @ky05uk3 its rly quick
[2:10:51] Suvaacc: @ky05uk3 only ak isnt, and he has like 80 rep
[2:10:52] scha_de: how many plants you can grow with 1 pesticide?
[2:11:11] Fishnet83: For sure NODDERS
[2:11:11] AdanTheEpiphany: 600 650 is good
[2:11:16] 1evilshark: they think you want only 44
[2:11:18] 1evilshark: 400
[2:11:18] spoonfullofMusic: yeah didnt you talk with ak yesterday for 600 and now suddenly its 400 KEKW
[2:11:40] Suvaacc: the 400 thing came from lovemores old info
[2:11:49] AdanTheEpiphany: this suppose to be your full time job right
[2:11:55] AdanTheEpiphany: technicaly
[2:11:56] legoliket: 600+ make sense
[2:12:14] legoliket: Ye
[2:12:16] onix146: NODDERS
[2:12:17] Suvaacc: yeah
[2:12:27] AdanTheEpiphany: they double their money is good
[2:12:29] slorebear: Can't work without product
[2:12:35] spoonfullofMusic: if he gets 600 for 20 brick each 3 days, that means you make 6k in 3 days + growing KEKW
[2:12:38] ky05uk3: you just need to present your case with the math SHRUGGERS
[2:12:45] AdanTheEpiphany: if u earn money u could buy more racks from profit
[2:12:47] Suvaacc: and if their rep is up there i think you'll make like 1600 on turf
[2:12:59] legoliket: They will also get more than 1200 with turf rep going up so 600 absolutely makes sense
[2:13:07] Chriss332211: does strain weed earn more?
[2:13:08] onix146: NODDERS need to treat the source better
[2:13:37] scha_de: classic drug seeds
[2:13:44] legoliket: Yeah strain weed is needed for turf rep @chriss332211
[2:13:47] spoonfullofMusic: im hoping one day there will be a grow up of a 100 plants here
[2:13:50] NemisizZ: throwing seeds away Kappa
[2:14:09] AdanTheEpiphany: either u get a weekly salary and  there a weed pile of money that pays for grows or they pay good for weed
[2:14:24] EnigmaQuip: I think just half the take should work.... if it's 1200 for the guys on the turd, then you get your 600, if it starts going up as they/the weed gets rep, your profits increase as well as theirs
[2:14:31] EnigmaQuip: turd *turf
[2:14:33] Suvaacc: @legoliket nah their shit weed atm gives rep also, but very little
[2:14:46] Lizzkhhalifa: oooooo I love this somg
[2:15:09] spoonfullofMusic: writing down how many bricks if the way to go tho, good luck with that with this group
[2:15:34] BobbyBoatRaces: im sure 4head will keep track of what he sells accurately KEKW
[2:16:00] slorebear: 4head bout to trade bricks for chocolate
[2:16:06] spoonfullofMusic: 100 rep and stil forgets the pesticides travpiWaiting
[2:16:20] legoliket: I think u can see the grams being pushed now if u got a strain in the HQ app @bobbyboatraces
[2:16:46] Suvaacc: 4head aint paying shit, the guy spent whole stream trying to sell trees for 10 bucks LUL
[2:17:45] Donner_Shabab: So this is all Strain weed now isnt it?
[2:17:54] Paralyzor: @Suvaacc they made like over 1k off of that then he gave lovemore half. and lovemore left it in a car that despawned..

[2:19:55] Suvaacc: big rack is 17500/5 + mats
[2:20:42] spoonfullofMusic: so lets say 5k? that means you need to invest 100k in racks just to be able to dry 100 plants, damn

[2:57:52] spoonfullofMusic: can't you buy 1 of each and check in your apt?

[2:58:19] blakfalt: CO2
[2:58:25] enjoylife4789: if it’s anything like irl plants are supposed to always have a certain amount of air hitting them in a day and good ventilation
[2:58:41] enjoylife4789: and of course light
[2:58:41] FatBored: Oh yeah, that oscillating fan is the one
[2:58:49] lor_say: this song sounds scuffed
[2:59:02] MadChemistTHC: putting 1 rack in your apartment as a test with nothing around it would show if you needed anything
[2:59:02] blakfalt: do the vents work underground?
[2:59:02] enjoylife4789: but yours are drying now so light don’t matter
[2:59:19] EpicHuggles: travpiHmm
[2:59:26] legoliket: Only 28 ventilation def need more
[2:59:27] EpicHuggles: trav WILL unlock the secrets
[2:59:35] Dangerouscrave: @enjoylife4789 in the dry stage you want no light
[2:59:44] Dangerouscrave: at least in irl
[2:59:46] spoonfullofMusic: you need a source to create the airflow (a fan) the ducts and vents just guide the air to the location, i mean its basic hvac
[2:59:52] cocofox3: it should give more ventilation
[3:00:11] EpicHuggles: is there a cure stage in this as well
[3:00:14] EnigmaQuip: need a controlled environment that doesn't get fucked with by everything else.... I agree playing in your apartment makes more sense
[3:00:40] Dangerouscrave: @travpiper  can you install something to pull air out of that room

[3:01:40] epic_smee: @spoonfullofmusic some of the devs are maniacs LUL
[3:01:43] r0xorzb0xorz: why would you use the night elf starting zone guide for leveling a paladin in elwynn? idiot!! ROFL!!!
[3:01:46] Suvaacc: i doubt its per room stuff, cause if you need to use the panel for right stats then it cant be per room, cause the panel shows whole house
[3:02:26] epic_smee: @suvaacc the heating lamps showed that proximity seems to be a thing though
[3:02:36] Kobe__Wan__Kenobi: LUL the layout is sick
[3:02:40] legoliket: More fans makes sense at least irl
[3:02:41] 2hopp: wtf is this wow overlay
[3:02:45] Dangerouscrave: is there some were to look this shit up did NP make a how to guide LMFAO
[3:02:46] spoonfullofMusic: experiment in your apt where you have nothing
[3:03:06] Suvaacc: @epic_smee do the lamps even do anything tho, i'm still not sure if they even help, cause shit drys so long
[3:03:31] EpicHuggles: travpiHmm
[3:03:50] legoliket: Yeah
[3:04:04] Dangerouscrave: it there a air flow meter on the stat i dont rem
[3:04:11] Suvaacc: @epic_smee i'm only saying this cause i remember at the beginning people drying weed in their barrels and those didnt have lamps
[3:04:25] enjoylife4789: is there settings on the humidifier or only one setting
[3:04:25] cocofox3: why do you need humidifiers to dry?
[3:05:09] cocofox3: yeah its kinda weird LuL
[3:05:24] EpicHuggles: i mean you do normally want to maintin 40-50% humidity in your drying room
[3:05:29] legoliket: A standard house usually has 40% humidity and houses in Los Angeles have 0 humidity base so
[3:05:31] dabbasaurus19: in the hood it’s box fans and dehumidifier’s
