[1:21:17] Fossabot: REMINDER: Backseating and Meta'ing is cringe. We do not want to see suggestions of where they should or should not look, do, etc. Nor should you remind the streamer of things he has forgotten. Him forgetting is part of the RP fun. 4.0 is new, unknown and exciting. Do not ruin the experience for the streamer (or chat) with your unwanted comments. You will get bopped into the next century. 🙂

[1:58:10] Fossabot: REMINDER: Backseating and Meta'ing is cringe. We do not want to see suggestions of where they should or should not look, do, etc. Nor should you remind the streamer of things he has forgotten. Him forgetting is part of the RP fun. 4.0 is new, unknown and exciting. Do not ruin the experience for the streamer (or chat) with your unwanted comments. You will get bopped into the next century. 🙂
