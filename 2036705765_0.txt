[1:18:48] Nohitzki: nope, no abilities, only red weapons
[1:18:53] ayla_: @donald_junior Drill anyone behind cover. So you could drill on one side, and force them to move the other way and throw a nade on that side. So then they have to peak or just take damage.
[1:18:54] Nohitzki: thinking about it
[1:18:54] Tay_aka_Tyr: @Nohitzki sheeeesh
[1:18:55] shortstough: thats the valk skin i used til i got the event one

[1:30:31] donaldjunior551: 30-30 and flatline hit hard sometimes
[1:30:57] ImEtherMX: @Spanish_Assassin i did think about it but its kind of in line with the passive speed boost of bang and conduit
[1:31:27] donaldjunior551: Love the hemlock and car.
[1:31:30] Granny__Tsunade: i complained about the 3030 for a long time til i finally started picking one up
[1:31:31] Spanish_Assassin: @ImEtherMX they have ult ability movement like maggie and ash
[1:31:41] StreamElements: Make sure to go check out and follow our socials! https://linktr.ee/HisandHersLive
[1:32:02] ayla_: 1x 301 used to be my long range gun couple seasons ago. I BEAMED with it
[1:32:14] donaldjunior551: @granny__tsunade sounds like me
[1:32:27] L3gz: that‚Äôs true for most iron sights, the 1x sight is further zoomed out
[1:32:34] Granny__Tsunade: same
[1:32:45] Tay_aka_Tyr: 1x hcog is still the best for a 301
[1:32:55] Granny__Tsunade: i just started using it this season.
[1:33:04] Tay_aka_Tyr: 2x for a flatty. 3x for marksman rifles
[1:33:06] ImEtherMX: @Spanish_Assassin i mean, maggie is kind of on the border, but ash's whole ult is an instant reposition rather than a percent speed boost
[1:33:09] Sm1ff74: hisandhersMom hisandhersMom
[1:33:22] donaldjunior551: I just started using the 30-30 my favorite combo with it is the car or flatline
[1:33:35] Fastlain: Bump Mom to FCS.
[1:34:01] Spanish_Assassin: @ImEtherMX true but a speed boost still sort of counts
[1:34:03] shortstough: that spurlocks team under gauzy?

[1:35:11] Tay_aka_Tyr: She lived wayyyy longer than I thought she would after Limo dropped lol

[1:36:40] Tay_aka_Tyr: @Granny__Tsunade Compared to other abilities, her ult really isn't amazing. Shorter distance than wraith or path ults, short stun when you come out of the port can suck
[1:36:59] Spanish_Assassin: ash seriously needs a buff
