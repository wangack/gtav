[5:39:26] daffodil86: @bulfwyne sweet, I picked a pack up last year but didn’t throw them this summer
[5:40:07] Bulfwyne: @daffodil86 depending on the size, I got the smaller size, but normally you want a 3/0 hook, can be a weighted hook too
[5:40:16] Bulfwyne: thats excited Trav HYPERS
[5:40:18] kire_writes_things: what's the advantage of making your own rigs?
[5:40:31] Bulfwyne: cheaper as fuck
[5:40:36] daffodil86: aight sick, just have to wait till June for bass season lol
[5:40:36] kire_writes_things: ah nice

[5:41:58] weaselinap: it swims fucking crazy fast even with slow reelin
[5:42:04] Bulfwyne: oh ... don't mix certain plastisol cause say if you make two baits with two different ones they can melt each other
[5:42:30] daffodil86: I threw a lot of micro baits on ultralight this year. was a lot of fun
[5:42:40] Bulfwyne: hands on stuff too so thats always a plus
[5:42:52] robotscanneverwin: LOL

[5:44:05] Bulfwyne: yea its cheap for sure, but its nice to customize stuff to print
[5:44:08] daffodil86: @bulfwyne same here. I like Nikko from Japan and Eurotackle stuff
[5:44:18] weaselinap: oh i got question for u bulf
[5:44:34] weaselinap: how to make the wormjims for crazyrigs
[5:44:37] Bulfwyne: @daffodil86 oh same ... i'm really wondering how to get really elastic plastic to shoot cause thats interesting
[5:44:49] weaselinap: all the stores here only have paddletail worms
[5:44:49] CensoredTH0ughTs: i remember i worked at a company like 20 years ago that got a 3d printer for rapid prototyping, a 12inx 12in model could take up to a week to print back then, its crazy how far the tech has come
[5:45:24] 0rezolve: Dead caught a furry! TheTarFu
[5:45:25] daffodil86: @bulfwyne I was just wondering about that type of plastic, like the Nikko or Z-man polymers.
[5:45:30] kire_writes_things: @CensoredTH0ughTs yeah my company makes the newer resin kinds. They're really good now
[5:45:45] kire_writes_things: err the company I work for, not "my" :P
[5:45:46] Bulfwyne: @weaselinap you mean wacky rigging a stick worm ?
[5:46:02] weaselinap: yehhh wacky rig

[5:46:21] weaselinap: only paddletails
[5:46:36] Bulfwyne: @weaselinap ahhh yea i actually got a 5 inch Senko style mold .... oh really ?? only paddle tails monkaHmm
[5:46:53] Bulfwyne: thats tripy
[5:46:55] MadChemistTHC: online market killed a lot of fishing stores
[5:46:57] weaselinap: like a wall full of 100+ different paddletail jigs
[5:47:08] ArrJay: -not a fisher- does bass pro not count? lol
[5:47:11] weaselinap: and nobody here ive ever seen use the wacky rigs
[5:47:17] daffodil86: just tackle warehouse it I guess
[5:47:19] weaselinap: its like people dont know it here
[5:47:39] MadChemistTHC: half of bass pro sells "bass pro" products

[5:48:12] Bulfwyne: yea fish get used to stuff a lot
[5:48:32] Berdach65: thats why i love using rooster tails, not too many people use them around where i am, especially in the spring
[5:48:40] 7thLettter: there’s gotta be small ma and pa shops down there no? @travpiper

[5:49:23] weaselinap: always catch like 3 pikes with then, then line snaps
[5:49:28] Bulfwyne: @weaselinap for a small stick bait for what your lookin for, you can get a alluminum one for around 50 bucks for two cavities if you just want to make stuff for yourself
