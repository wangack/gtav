[7:33:56] Ghassan___: @majinrufio23 Good night.
[7:34:37] KillScotty: @LickMuffHD  why is gang stuff cringe? you should run a server bro you know whats up
[7:34:40] LionSuit: yeah hopefully the 25 cleaned windows cashes in
[7:35:32] judewuzhere: You gotta wash all of them looks like
[7:35:47] judewuzhere: Nice
[7:35:47] LickMuffHD: @killscotty it just gets overplayed, gang RP gets too power-gamey if not checked
[7:36:04] cameforthetacos: new whip?
[7:36:14] KillScotty: @LickMuffHD  literally depends on server rules but ya
[7:36:29] KillScotty: gang rp is great when balanced
[7:36:31] LickMuffHD: Oh yeah 100% @killscotty
[7:36:45] moodydhingus: why do shake shacks straws taste like gasoline at first
[7:36:50] KillScotty: this server isnt very gang centric though is it?
[7:36:53] KillScotty: not from what ive seen
[7:37:09] LickMuffHD: Just needs that balance of civ rp being rewarded and gang rp having punishments that fit the crime. Like no gang members becoming mayor etc
[7:37:10] KillScotty: right
[7:37:47] KillScotty: it just gets bad when a gang holds down an area or service and you hit a pay wall to access those things
[7:37:54] KillScotty: then its just annoying as fuck

[7:44:36] LickMuffHD: @zandohr when it gets out of hand it‚Äôs cringe. Like in most servers, but ignite has been different about that
[7:44:55] zandohr: certain people treat it like nopixel gangs which is when it gets cringe
[7:45:05] zandohr: like all about their reputation etc
[7:45:11] KillScotty: @LickMuffHD  i think what your consensus comes down to is: don't let gangs run the city
[7:45:12] KillScotty: lol
[7:45:26] zandohr: gangs running a city is cringe
[7:45:48] LickMuffHD: Yeah haha I‚Äôm coming from a NoPixel perspective. That and any public server out there spbMUL
[7:46:05] KillScotty: Yeah NP is insane i dont understand people who enjoy watching that
