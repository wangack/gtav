[4:06:41] disruptedorder: I think they should drop off quicker, you want to detour bad behavior but not completely detour good content if its worth it.
[4:06:43] lookingfornothinghere: @srejok none everyone was literally being corrupt af and assault random civs for the luls
[4:06:45] m1tchole: My only criticism (sure it's been flagged before) is maybe it takes a little too long for a DAP to drop off, it's 60 days right?
[4:06:52] MDM4ever1986HD: @ykicka for example Denzel during this month
[4:06:52] scaredsquid: simple solution, let everyone do whatever they want whenever they want with no consequences totally won’t effect anything
[4:06:54] SeaOfEmpty: Hours of community service. And essays on what and why what they did was wrong. Normal court ordered stuff
[4:06:54] MWRGaming: @driver1036 *60 Days
[4:06:56] MDM4ever1986HD: WWWWWW
[4:06:59] jersey_jesus: A dap is a handshake not a punishment UltraMad
[4:07:09] ChadDolblin: DAP system isnt bad, cops are just making bad decisions and being punished like they should. Gotta weed out the bad cops and dap system is doing that
[4:07:10] judgement_12: this cop car is not going to have any breaks once this patrol is over
[4:07:15] Wintyer2: Mabey Dap time drops off for hours worked ingame instead of real life dayts
[4:07:32] illuminat4242: My thoughts on the daps. They last too long imo.  I mean 60 days Statue of limitations is only 30 days.
[4:07:34] GrumpyTreeFrog: did i miss something? was someone dapped?
[4:07:35] scaredsquid: @wintyer2 agree with this
[4:07:35] D00Dlles: I like rp punishments more than the current daps. like making people do footpatrol in 3.0
[4:07:36] DanLGG: I have a suggestion, For situations where a dap would be issued like this pit for example. rather than a strike or a dap officers get a 1 time training course in whatever issue obviously doesn’t apply to egregious violations but small mistakes that happen
[4:07:44] god__turkey: Okay ive got a full page paper here for you sir
[4:07:49] T2Apex: daps weighted by time spent on duty so the ones on for so long don't get hit the hardest because they are more likely to accrue daps
[4:07:51] SXR9: 2 months is just so long
[4:07:51] BadRabbits: Punnishment details are a fun idea.
[4:07:54] BurningFlag: @Wintyer2 I kind like this idea as a change
[4:07:54] MDM4ever1986HD: I mean Johnson was in the wrong place wrong time when Denzel was in a current active chase
[4:07:58] Eliminator_V: At 9 daps? Time to go off duty for 30 days
[4:08:00] TheEmmorf: DAPS should fall of based upon time on duty not days.
[4:08:05] Rare__Potato: turkey really went to ChatGPT KEKFeet
[4:08:14] god__turkey: @Rare__Potato I DID XD
[4:08:16] BadRabbits: Bike patrols, State business guarding etc.
[4:08:24] mad0monk: It wouldn't hurt
[4:08:26] god__turkey: @Rare__Potato It acutally gave me a good answer tho
[4:08:34] ChadDolblin: @TheEmmorf nah, days is better. 30 days
[4:08:36] SXR9: admin unlock it forsenCD
[4:08:37] keishin__: each dap 5  hours of mindless paperwork thatll get them to follow sops
[4:08:38] jersey_jesus: We need courses on how to push adoption fraud NODDERS
[4:08:40] MWRGaming: +1 DAP for locking the door
[4:08:45] Reanna_x: locking the do not lock door RAGEY
[4:08:47] lookingfornothinghere: people mention time spend on duty should play a role by that logic cops that do half of cornwoods time have half the daps right? no they just dont do dumbshit
[4:08:48] BurningFlag: I think I know who did it peepoGiggle
[4:08:50] TheTourist_: scrap dap points. reintroduce strike points, where 10 is a indefinite suspension and they fall off after 60 days. that'll work.
[4:08:50] MsHollyyy: Take them to the race track
[4:08:52] illuminat4242: I just feel that 60 days is too long for daps to last.

[4:09:01] mad0monk: It may not fix the problem entirely but it will set things in the right direction
[4:09:03] Rare__Potato: I think DAP s should be permanent and never fall off NODDERS only way to fix the DAP system
[4:09:13] Dirk_Richter: DAPs should fall off based on number of hours on duty, not calendar days. Currently it punishes cops who come around more frequently, which is what you want to be encouraging
[4:09:16] jersey_jesus: oop
[4:09:19] god__turkey: This is a good Idea you could add "Public Apologies: For particularly egregious offenses that impact the roleplay community, officers may be required to issue public apologies either through in-game announcements or forum posts."

[9:01:34] hoshoryu: good
[9:01:34] rinacon: Ramee technically walked onto scene which is the difficult part there
[9:01:36] MonsterFuel: who's more passionate, elderly soap opera watchers or rp enjoyers

See, normally if you go one on one with another captain, you got a 50/50 chance of winning. But I'm a genetic freak and I'm not normal! So you got a 25%, AT BEST, at beat me. Then you add Ruby York to the mix, your chances of winning drastic go down.

[12:53:08] scaredsquid: beric is basically slacks when he’s away
[12:53:25] jetstargirls: @Artsii1994 I'vew seen slacks do crazy hours so email confirm when they can be awake at the beginning of shift three or the end and the captain of shift 1 or two can start earlier or stay later to just promote people to get more officers
[12:53:28] kingofthebeats: @kingofthebeats Nothing gonna come through, Cornwood is a 4fun cop with no real knowledge
[12:53:32] Artsii1994: The seniors have been leading the shifts even if a captain isnt present
[12:53:43] rclemon_: Can you just hire Kai Cenat to the PD already

[12:55:41] jadetortoise: captains need to delegate the authority, rather than relying on them to usurp it in the power vacuum
[12:55:45] Pandrax86: @christiannnnnnnnn won’t happen. under sheriff, definitely.
[12:55:56] kingofthebeats: @jetstargirls imagine saying to yourself: "Maybe I'm just being logical"
[12:55:59] MadHuskies: that voice deserve to CoP
[12:56:00] Ned15: @jadetortoise yep
[12:56:00] jetstargirls: @Artsii1994 staying an hour longer or starting an hour earlier should be an easy thing to do if it can be planned ahead of time via discord of when the people that are getting promoted need to be awake or can be awake to get promoted
[12:56:06] Flying_Floor: @krisholborn2024 Objectively there should be only 1 sheriff CORNMAN
