[1:58:48] Encryptoh: @bmr236 loki is my overall favorite MCU character, so i really hope they make the fight scenes a lot more interesting in season 2
[1:58:49] themfvoid: The wolverine was a good test for them to see how far they could go with Logan
[1:58:51] Lickmysaltypeanut: @LordOfThePickles yeah it could have been it. But the last good movie was the mad max road of fury
[1:58:51] TheTrafficCone1: Exactly they could not capitalize on that success at all, just L after L, then Logan from the top rope
[1:58:52] Bansou: i was looking through the xman movies and i did not even know Dark phoenix came out in like 2019 or new mutants

[1:59:45] IPickRam: Marvel sold a bunch of properties in 2000 cause bankruptcy. They finally got a TON of them back
[1:59:59] Bronzejackk: i dont understand the ppl that want thor to be super serious movies but like we had those in the first 2 thor movies and they were terrible
[2:00:01] evengkx: @otisbdriftwood_ shame they killed off Banshee
[2:00:03] RexBandara: Marvel shows are like 20 mins and 10 mins of credits not good for storytelling

[2:00:43] bmr236: @encryptoh NODDERS
[2:00:44] LovelyMelody: My golden rule for marvel at this point is basically anything and everything touched by Taika Waititi is gold and thats final
[2:00:48] IPickRam: @AvengingTragedy The spiderman one is weird cause Sony and Disney can have their own universe KEKW
[2:00:53] sir_hung: @avengingtragedy thats because sony knows spiderman makes a shit ton of money
