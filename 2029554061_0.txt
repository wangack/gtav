[4:06:05] NebelKop: other pub servers have that
[4:06:16] AtomicShoelace: but the music would play through the game sound so it would be impossible to split the audio track in the vod
[4:06:33] CasperNomNom: yeah its whack
[4:06:35] KorbenDallas815: i think they have added setting for that
[4:06:45] NebelKop: Poke used that to play the super loud pipe sound on other servers
[4:07:10] KorbenDallas815: cause in other games there are ways to push the voip audio through a different sources
[4:07:20] AtomicShoelace: well yes you could turn it off, but I mean no one would turn it on because it would ruin all vods
[4:07:25] Pheyerus: @nebelkop that was always so fuckin funny
