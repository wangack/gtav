[4:43:00] xJroKx: The last time, the cop wasn‚Äôt having it and just plain said He doesn‚Äôt believe you. @uberhaxornova

[6:18:25] Voltorin: GTA RP loot crates uhnKek
[6:18:27] RezaQ8: I think thats why the food crates were made, to see if the coding would work for it
[6:18:31] OTROYOBOYO: NPCs are nuts
[6:18:31] Sly_Fox18: i mean you got food crates
[6:18:36] 3spada_Grande: Maybe if ur holding more than 2 bricks it forces u to hold crate prop
[6:18:37] A_j_a_x_: probably just a copy paste of the food crate
[6:18:38] cxxf_: just replace the food with coke. shouldn't be too hard
[6:18:38] bigfatcob: maybe you have teddy bears and wwhen you use them it puts coke in your thing? so you can hide coke in stuffed animals
[6:18:43] RKO6301221: yeah those Rifle Bodies are from over a year and a half ago lol
[6:18:50] bob_the_user: the coding wouldnt be too bad it would just be from a food item to coke which is kinda easier
[6:18:54] A_j_a_x_: i think it would just be an item ID
[6:18:55] rentalsocks: only if you can put items in the crate yourself
[6:18:55] An_Whale: at this point ask for admin privileges KEKW

[6:19:21] lmrainy: @jeannnbean goodnight vadeHug
[6:19:27] Peydennn: that would be sick tho, instead of storing all the drugs in the warehouse to decay you packed them up into crates that could be opened at a later date with like 100 bags of coke so people could kinda sort of store coke without it decaying but once they opened it they had to use all of it

[6:20:23] bob_the_user: you take the crate to the docks to unpack it and cut it up too
[6:20:24] rentalsocks: just dont kill off Nikez in Among Us
