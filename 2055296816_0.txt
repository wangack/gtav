[0:55:06] little1wiki: the excitement seeing this is the house you guys bought as this is the house my characters friends bought on occams community server
[0:55:09] Makaveli079: it’s really cool location
[0:55:11] jimothy64: Be cool if an interior could one day be added to the garage, give Damien a studio or something
[0:55:15] molotov_michelle: Amazing for you and Damian yeah
[0:55:27] retrowolf0498: So who's ready for the Juno meltdown when she calls Tessa about the house being bought?
[0:55:33] JiminyDickit: WICKED
[0:55:39] darthdin: short commute
[0:55:52] DJayEnzyme: @retrowolf0498 i need to get popcorn before that happens
[0:56:05] Makaveli079: yeah that would be cool if the garage can be bought too
[0:56:14] retrowolf0498: Hopefully I'll be on my lunch break
[0:56:24] jimothy64: Got a dumpster next door for dramatic meltdowns
[0:56:29] SharkBait_1410: can you use the back door?
[0:56:41] 80sHairMetalFan: nakkiS
[0:56:49] molotov_michelle: koilWow

[1:00:15] krek_ii: Yo what's up
[1:01:27] jimothy64: For walls or floors?
[1:03:05] silverarrows47: Lottie!!!!
[1:05:37] connect_duck69: What happened to Jay's voice
[1:05:49] Makaveli079: cozy decorating stream nakkiCocoa
[1:06:04] tyty3156: the jay voice messed up his throat
[1:06:08] silverarrows47: @connect_duck69 He's using his crim voice until he's healed up
[1:06:21] QuesoCommander: nakkiLUL
[1:06:46] silverarrows47: OMEGALUL
[1:06:46] connect_duck69: @silverarrows47 ok got it
[1:07:07] Corvis_glyph: KEKW
[1:07:12] silverarrows47: so in other words.....gtfo KEKW
[1:07:13] muffinplaysgames: KEKW
[1:07:24] JoeayIV: gotta manually adjust the angle till it fits
[1:07:33] JoeayIV: so one of the rotations
[1:07:35] jimothy64: Adjust the snapping?
[1:07:37] NoobEmployee: Manual angle adjustment?
[1:07:37] QuesoCommander: reduce the snap rotation?
[1:07:40] connect_duck69: The house is uneven
[1:07:41] tarrasski: Change the small rotation?
[1:08:24] JoeayIV: gotta talk in the Tessa voice OOC now for the +1
[1:09:54] silverarrows47: I use to complain about Fallout 4's decorating mods..but this is so much more advanced
[1:10:20] nobodybodon: fallout 4 really needs it
[1:10:25] nobodybodon: HECK building in fallout 4
[1:10:49] connect_duck69: Are you just going to leave the wall as it is
[1:10:52] Chiracho: @silverarrows47 man falouts decorating infuriated me so much with how janky it could get sometimes.
[1:11:30] apairidox: Are you going to put in false walls/floors to hide the crim stuff
[1:11:32] silverarrows47: Just need one game to get decorating just right
[1:11:48] jimothy64: Just wish there was less.. *stuff* on the screen. Makes it so hard to actually see anything you're doing when like half the space is menus that aren't even flush to the edge of the display area
[1:11:55] DerpyFlerpy: Hello Nakkida and Chat nakkiHi nakkiLoveBlue
[1:12:10] silverarrows47: @jimothy64 Agreed
[1:12:12] connect_duck69: @derpyflerpy hello
[1:12:19] QuesoCommander: @jimothy64 it looks like the you can collapse the side panels
[1:13:02] nobodybodon: I just realized how much of a pain decorating around the windows is gonna be
[1:13:03] silverarrows47: OMEGALUL
[1:13:17] jimothy64: Yeah but it'd be nice if the side panels were actually at the side, not halfway into the screen @quesocommander
[1:14:39] Chiracho: i can't wait for the first rooftop meeting.
[1:15:03] jimothy64: Just waiting for Juno to work out Tessa got this house
[1:15:13] Steven_b: cant wait for juno to find out we have her house rosesEvil
[1:15:50] jimothy64: They have to nap to see all the major changes iirc
[1:15:59] silverarrows47: They may have to run far away from the house and then run back too
[1:16:06] retrowolf0498: If that's the case, it's best for you to finish before they do.
[1:16:07] nobodybodon: Andi mentioned offhandedly that Juno was looking at it and you're all out here acting like she's gonna oceandump tessa when she finds out
[1:16:22] darthdin: wait was this Juno's 3.0 house?
[1:16:31] nobodybodon: @darthdin NOPERS
[1:17:06] Chiracho: @nobodybodon ocean dumping is the least of the worries.. it;s the ET that worries me KEKW
[1:17:07] QuesoCommander: nodd
[1:17:18] nobodybodon: 2 rooms, Tessas and then a triple bunk bed for the boys nakkiKEKS
[1:17:22] Chiracho: you know she's gonna play on that shit hard
[1:17:38] jimothy64: @nobodybodon nah I'm just banking on a solid attempted guilt trip.. like she tried when Tessa didn't wanna buy with her lol
[1:18:28] nobodybodon: its also like, the 8th time it's been brought up
[1:18:39] jimothy64: The spice must flow, but I'm British so like, mild spices are fine too :P
[1:18:56] silverarrows47: Funny how this works...one house leads to a business establishment...and then a warehouse...and then a bigger house and so on
[1:19:24] connect_duck69: The windows bother me so bad
[1:19:32] chinbinchin: LETHIMCOOK shes cookin
[1:19:48] retrowolf0498: I was just saying that Juno might call Tessa and have a meltdown because someone bought the house. Not that Tessa bought it.

[1:19:49] QuesoCommander: at least once you have the parts it doesn't cost any extra to redo in the future
[1:20:07] nobodybodon: @retrowolf0498 my point is more that we don't even know how much juno wanted
[1:20:14] nobodybodon: sorry, sent early
[1:20:22] jimothy64: Glitchy wall plants can be hidden with more plant
[1:20:26] retrowolf0498: Yea. Which is why I said might.
[1:20:27] nobodybodon: this house, it might be one of a half dozen options she liked
[1:20:52] connect_duck69: You can make bunk beds
[1:20:53] QuesoCommander: gonna have to have raise the first floor way up to make 3 work I think

[1:53:53] Rekonin: So, as houses aren't instanced anymore, that means embedding things through walls won't work as well, right?
[1:55:31] owlicus: nakkiMeltdown
[1:55:35] jimothy64: Massive menus all over the screen, and if you click anywhere near them even when collapsed, it doesn't work.. maddening
[1:57:00] JoeayIV: could copy the rotation of the floor
[1:57:04] JoeayIV: since you lined it up
[1:57:21] owlicus: interior decorating prices are going to go up because of normies not being able to handle all of this
[1:57:29] JoeayIV: i have no idea
[1:57:35] JoeayIV: i think its X
[1:57:42] TEKYTECH: y
[1:57:52] Rekonin: the arrow up down is green, so the matching one?
[1:57:59] jimothy64: Can you access the decorating while in admin noclip mode? Might counter the falling scuff
[1:58:00] owlicus: i'll say Z just to cover our bases
[1:58:04] TEKYTECH: the x is left to right and y is back to front
[1:58:05] retrowolf0498: Depends on which way.
[1:58:08] jimothy64: Also, the rotations are colour coded
[1:58:10] TEKYTECH: z is up and down
[1:58:28] muffinplaysgames: @TEKYTECH This one seems trustworthy. They have TECH in their name in all caps XD
[1:58:40] TEKYTECH: lol
[1:59:11] JoeayIV: okay hear me out
[1:59:13] Chiracho: try Y at 0
[1:59:16] JoeayIV: copy the Z from the floor
[1:59:22] JoeayIV: and then add or minus 90
[1:59:25] Rekonin: does holding ctrl, shift, or alt while you rotate snap?
[1:59:36] JoeayIV: wait
[1:59:38] JoeayIV: add 90
[1:59:42] retrowolf0498: So z is rotational?
[1:59:43] QuesoCommander: needs + 180
[1:59:54] JoeayIV: 136.6
[1:59:56] jimothy64: 136.6
[2:00:17] TEKYTECH: i think its when you go below ground level
[2:00:42] jimothy64: Does admin noclip help? Obviously doesn't fix the underlying issue but might be a personal fix?
[2:01:16] jimothy64: Try 135
[2:01:23] davelecook: nakkiHello everyone, just passing quick during lil break of job .
[2:01:42] Chiracho: 135.0
[2:01:53] davelecook: nakkiDerp we house designing now ?
[2:02:45] JoeayIV: need the god dam angle of the house nakkiMeltdown
[2:02:48] darthdin: jay damien  and tessa and 2 others
[2:03:05] davelecook: gtg brb later nakkiSip
[2:03:08] QuesoCommander: add or substract 0.1 until it lines up
[2:03:11] JoeayIV: whats the stats on the floor on the bottom
[2:03:17] JoeayIV: easy to line up squares
[2:03:31] JoeayIV: is that line up perfectly?
[2:03:34] Chiracho: my guess is it just works on 45 degrees
[2:03:36] QuesoCommander: the models might not be perfectly aligned with each other
[2:03:36] Xee889: what house is that? ill get you the house angle. we just havn't added it to display anywhere yet
[2:03:44] QuesoCommander: *the different models
[2:04:07] jimothy64: Try Z-rotaion 134?
[2:04:11] Zaitohro: we love xee
[2:04:25] tyty3156: true @zaitohro
[2:04:26] Xee889: skill issue imo

[2:04:34] CatGotYourKeyboard: nakkiKEKS

[2:04:41] KristoferYee: Any admins?
[2:04:41] Chiracho: git gud nerd
[2:04:50] Xee889: 1.43 is the house angle
[2:04:56] TheJRoller: Do you have something double bound?
[2:05:02] Xee889: on Z rotation
[2:05:02] Zaitohro: Xee do you like the umbrella tent i built
[2:05:15] Xee889: bottom green one
[2:05:18] Xee889: world probably
[2:05:18] StreamElements: Feel free to join my Discord flock, 5000 members and growing! https://discordapp.com/invite/nakkida
[2:05:19] jimothy64: So add or remove that to standard angles
[2:05:40] Chiracho: if you look at the sphere the colour line up in the menu with it
[2:05:46] Xee889: then u can turn snap rotation up  to keep the angle if you need
[2:06:31] Xee889: type 1.43 into the Green rotation
[2:06:31] jimothy64: I think you need 133.57 for the Z on the stairs
[2:06:52] Rekonin: yea, you're either adding or subtracting that amount from every Z rotation
[2:07:09] QuesoCommander: -135 for the rotation
[2:07:11] Rekonin: 135 - 1.43 = 133.57
[2:07:18] Ravidge: Now set Snap Rotation to something that divides well with 360. like 15 or
[2:08:08] QuesoCommander: looks like the snap rotation is aligned with everything else like before
[2:08:10] jimothy64: That's 3 degrees off
[2:08:54] QuesoCommander: ye
[2:09:10] jimothy64: So the angle for the stairs is 133.57.. its hard to really explain why lol
[2:09:21] Chiracho: think of angles. every 45 you add up changes the direction
[2:09:34] Chiracho: with the engle of the house you just take that off from it.
[2:09:39] Chiracho: angle*
[2:09:48] StreamElements: Nakkida's YT is here! Don't forget to subscribe and smash that like button pepeLaugh https://www.youtube.com/c/Nakkida
[2:10:00] jimothy64: Try the same, it being a square it might be fine
[2:10:07] Chiracho: the same as the stairs on z i'd guess
[2:10:27] JoeayIV: is that it shifting from local to world?
[2:10:28] QuesoCommander: computers are bad at math when it come to decimals but it'll be close enough
[2:10:32] Arkwendris: Its the same number its weird number rounding
[2:10:33] Ravidge: rounding errors, just roll with it
[2:10:37] Rekonin: OH I see what we talking about... If you set a Z rotation of 1.43, then you use the higher snap rotation so it turns that number of degrees each click
[2:10:44] Rekonin: Then you don't have to do math
[2:10:54] elisedotexe: 111 raiders from elisedotexe have joined! 
[2:11:15] QuesoCommander: @Rekonin she tried that but the snap rotation snapped to other values
[2:11:25] IIIIHELLIIII: nakkiLoveBlue nakkiLoveBlue nakkiLoveBlue nakkiLoveBlue
[2:11:31] elisedotexe: looks complicated!
[2:11:32] Xee889: @Rekonin ye, this is the idea. just watch your not switching between local and world, cause the angling might be different
[2:11:46] puffsOG: nakkiShrug
[2:11:47] elisedotexe: my friend reccomended you! i hope you have a wonderful stream <3
[2:11:49] jimothy64: Try the same 133.57 for the floor Z
[2:12:03] Axwenn: Hiya!
[2:12:05] Xee889: change to local and use that angle
[2:12:15] Chiracho: change the snap movement and rotation
[2:12:29] Chiracho: maybe that helps?
[2:12:39] Xee889: u can once you get the angle
[2:13:00] JoeayIV: so, if im understanding right
[2:13:13] JoeayIV: you'd just use the number in Z rotation after going to local
[2:13:18] JoeayIV: and just math from that number?
[2:13:21] LGCaliber: I think someone just needs to give her a 1 2 3 4 step instruction
[2:13:22] JoeayIV: or rotate from that number
[2:13:26] Xee889: switch to local
[2:13:27] jimothy64: Yes, 133.57 should be right
[2:13:48] puffsOG: I need some weed to figure this maths out nakkiWut
[2:13:48] Arkwendris: 1.0-.43 = 57
[2:13:50] Thisisme710: nakkiHALD
[2:13:56] jimothy64: By subtracting the 1.43 from 135°
[2:14:00] TEKYTECH: 45 x 3 =135 - 1.24 = 133.57
[2:14:11] TEKYTECH: sorry meant 1.43
[2:14:28] retrowolf0498: This is why I hated geometry in high-school.
[2:14:28] Axwenn: Ahh. I was the one who recommended the raid but I was caught up in the ads lmao.
[2:14:28] puffsOG: exactly
[2:14:31] KristoferYee: yeePop
[2:14:38] jimothy64: It's real tricky to explain without an essay
[2:14:46] Mimsy34: i have to google how to do my kids math, so i'm not going to be any help
[2:15:08] Rekonin: The whole house is slightly angled, by 1.43... so everything needs to be angled off regular 45s and 90s etc by that amount
[2:15:15] jimothy64: Should be
[2:15:22] btc718: It’s good enough
[2:15:23] TEKYTECH: yea i believe so if the house is at that angle

[2:15:56] Axwenn: My geometry professor is rolling in their grave with joy rn....
[2:16:05] QuesoCommander: nodd
[2:16:39] Midrok: yes, it roated the square arround to be in-sync with the stairs
[2:16:43] JoeayIV: don't click near the menus
[2:16:54] TheJRoller: The security panel?
[2:17:05] Xee889: i don't know. its annoying. ghost objects. prob be easier in advanced edit mode but u keep falling thru the world lol
[2:17:17] jimothy64: Clicking anywhere near the menus, even when they're collapsed, causes issues it seems.
[2:17:41] puffsOG: no clicking
[2:17:41] jimothy64: Does it play well with normal Admin Noclip to stop the falling thing?
[2:17:45] Arkwendris: Is there something bound to R
[2:17:51] QuesoCommander: do you only fall when switching to rotate? could align object first then go advanced
[2:18:29] Rekonin: reduce the snap movement
[2:18:35] dudeeitsme: I found your stream on a compilation awhile ago and followed because i loved your voice, now i come every once and awhile to hear you talk <3
[2:18:38] ChestSpike: banister!
[2:18:48] Rekonin: ah, poop
[2:18:52] JoeayIV: you could either move the stairs or the floor
[2:18:56] puffsOG: look. We're striving for 98%, not 100%
[2:18:57] jimothy64: Microadjustment without snapping
[2:19:02] JoeayIV: gonna have to move the stairs anyways
[2:19:12] btc718: we don’t. don’t stress yourself pls
[2:19:13] grandma_p: put snap movement to 0.0 and you can put it exactly where you want
[2:19:26] Xee889: @Zaitohro is this in the house?
[2:20:46] LGCaliber: I think you can maybe adjust the numbers manually by adding/subtracting a bit to the numbers?

[2:21:25] JoeayIV: yea
[2:21:58] Ravidge: If it moving in local space it's gonna affect at least 2 position variables if it's on an angle
[2:21:59] TEKYTECH: i dont thinkthe floor is completely straight so you move it it affect x and y should only affect x i believe
[2:22:07] Arkwendris: well since its not on a straight angle its both
[2:22:13] puffsOG: Wow
[2:22:17] puffsOG: nakkiHm
[2:22:36] TEKYTECH: put x to -90 and y to 0
[2:22:39] Zacalak1515: Howdy Nakkida! Howdy Chat!
[2:22:52] jimothy64: Oh, set the rotations on the floor to be simple numbers.. the tiny decimels are messing it up
[2:22:54] TEKYTECH: the rotation
[2:22:55] QuesoCommander: they mean the rotation
[2:23:07] nobodybodon: the house is not aligned to the world grid
[2:23:10] nobodybodon: the decorating menu is
[2:23:35] retrowolf0498: Is it a 360 style system?
[2:23:51] jimothy64: That should make aligning a little easier
[2:24:59] Xee889: editor needs some tlc lol
[2:25:10] TEKYTECH: thats crazy
[2:25:12] grandma_p: just need to do a little calculus to place a floor KEKW. Id lose my mind lol

[2:25:53] Rozmere: Snapping to origin or something? Or snapping to some sort of grid point?
[2:26:07] jimothy64: When the 3.0 editor with all its well documented issues is preferable lol
[2:26:29] puffsOG: this is life now nakkiRIP
[2:27:16] jimothy64: To be fair, the 3.0 editor induced similar levels of frustration earlier on so.. maybe it's a "things will get better with time and practice" situation
[2:27:37] QuesoCommander: progress nakkiV
[2:27:43] btc718: yes
[2:28:10] Xee889: it takes a bit to get use to, but it does do some frustrating things sometimes
[2:28:39] jimothy64: Imma go cook, be back later
[2:28:44] nobodybodon: nakkiToxic
[2:28:49] TEKYTECH: i perssonally would get someone to design and then just place the stuff lol
[2:28:50] JoeayIV: just start adding .0001 to the y number till its right

[2:31:17] QuesoCommander: funky validation logic on the decimal count
[2:31:29] btc718: maybe delay?
[2:31:40] Xee889: might be rounding because you got snap on, prob also a bug in the inputs
[2:31:42] KraziAJ: Whadda you doin?
[2:31:44] JoeayIV: okay
[2:31:47] JoeayIV: so turn the snap off?

[2:32:56] JoeayIV: fuck it
[2:33:00] JoeayIV: try 6323

[3:08:56] Ravidge: So... considering the stair length, how much headroom does it leave in the basement?
[3:09:08] jimothy64: I have cooked an entire meal since the stair angle debacle lol

[3:11:53] jimothy64: Hey, I'm sure you can find an architecture magazine that's insisting that low ceilings are the next big thing
[3:11:56] KraziAJ: Well
[3:12:01] nobodybodon: it looks like an average 8 foot ceiling
[3:12:04] nobodybodon: ish
[3:12:18] nobodybodon: most spaces in GTAV are just way taller because of the third person camera
[3:12:24] IosefSerov: Our last house the basement was hecka short, I had to bend down to move around without smackin' my head.
[3:12:30] KraziAJ: Are you able to adjust the width of the floor?
[3:12:37] retrowolf0498: Do the top of the stairs stick outside a bit?
[3:12:48] nobodybodon: @KraziAJ if you mean the thickness, no

[3:19:12] silverarrows47: it would be cool if you could just snap objects and they would just line up automatically for you.
[3:19:27] KraziAJ: by a good 30%
[3:19:37] Ravidge: There's gotta be a way to replace the selected prop without creating a new one, maybe Alt clicking?
[3:19:49] UmbrellaFox: Sorry, it's been a minute since i've been here.  which house did Tessa end up getting?
[3:20:10] Rekonin: There's a settings and FAQ at the top, could be something in there

[3:48:21] retrowolf0498: Yea. I thought so.
[3:48:46] QuesoCommander: pretty sure that could be fixed when you set up "rooms"
[3:48:58] retrowolf0498: How long ago was that?

[7:25:49] UmbrellaFox: bay window
[7:25:59] nobodybodon: say "not today"?
[7:26:13] UmbrellaFox: just cover it with a facade LUL
[7:26:25] sanzonw: Wub Wub Wub Nodders
[7:26:30] sanzonw: NODDERS
[7:27:14] UmbrellaFox: oooo that looks better
[7:27:23] nobodybodon: ummm
[7:27:36] UmbrellaFox: um there is no rotation to reflect
[7:27:38] happy_questionmark: are you sure the frame you want isn't in the list?
[7:27:38] nobodybodon: you ask chat and hope at least 1 person actually knows the answer
[7:27:38] JoeayIV: its uh
[7:27:58] UmbrellaFox: LUL
[7:28:01] ThatSoKyuRo: but ur the streamer u should now the questions to everything Kappa
[7:28:05] JoeayIV: there is something funky here
[7:28:17] JoeayIV: can you rotate it slightly?
[7:28:30] UmbrellaFox: you're going to have to put 90 or -90 in the z rotation
[7:28:31] sanzonw: ahh Z rotation
[7:28:34] JoeayIV: okay back to 0
[7:28:56] JoeayIV: actually idk
[7:28:57] sanzonw: what does 180 on z rotation do?
[7:28:59] JoeayIV: i need a protractor
[7:29:00] klaunns: isnt it like 180 on Z
[7:29:11] UmbrellaFox: it's 180 indeed
[7:29:15] JoeayIV: yea 180
[7:29:15] filipe_vasconcellos_: hello good morning nikkisFlower nikkisUwU
[7:29:21] JoeayIV: or -180
[7:29:23] UmbrellaFox: nope 90
[7:29:24] UmbrellaFox: haha
[7:29:26] sanzonw: haha 90?
[7:29:26] klaunns: nop
[7:29:27] JoeayIV: fuck
[7:29:27] klaunns: LMAO
[7:29:28] JoeayIV: chat
[7:29:28] jimothy64: 90
[7:29:30] JoeayIV: yea
[7:29:31] JoeayIV: 90
[7:29:33] JoeayIV: or -90
[7:29:36] UmbrellaFox: 180 was just a full half rotation LUL
[7:29:38] UmbrellaFox: you tricked me
[7:29:45] sanzonw: we all failed math together POGU
[7:29:58] VzzionFourEyes: 90 doesnt look right
[7:30:02] UmbrellaFox: I at least can say i initially got it right LUL
[7:30:05] nobodybodon: the real question is how are you gonna plug the invisible trapezoid?
[7:30:08] JoeayIV: i do think it needs to be rotated slightly
[7:30:12] sanzonw: True @UmbrellaFox got it
[7:30:17] JoeayIV: to match the outside line
[7:30:23] filipe_vasconcellos_: nikkisCringe Math
[7:30:27] JoeayIV: probably by 1.43
[7:30:30] JoeayIV: + or -
[7:30:31] CatGotYourKeyboard: NODDERS Me too. I didn't struggle with any other subject.
[7:30:34] nobodybodon: But strimmer, there are so many more valid reasons to hate you
[7:30:38] nobodybodon: nakkiHuggers
[7:30:41] jimothy64: Math was my second best, but also, it's like 6am lol
[7:30:48] UmbrellaFox: I love math. It's all logic.  Your teacher can't mark an answer 'wrong' because they disagree.  it's factual
[7:30:49] ThatSoKyuRo: I need brain to do this maths stuffs Kappa
[7:31:14] JoeayIV: can you try 91.43 or 88.57 on the 2nd window?
[7:31:25] UmbrellaFox: gotta bring the left window closer i think
[7:31:33] JoeayIV: trust me on this
[7:31:39] JoeayIV: 91.43 or 88.57
[7:31:40] UmbrellaFox: ah nope you might have it perfect
[7:31:43] JoeayIV: right one
[7:31:47] filipe_vasconcellos_: my best subjects ware Geography, history of art and art nikkisGiggle
[7:31:54] UmbrellaFox: z rotation
[7:31:54] JoeayIV: Z
[7:31:55] klaunns: z rotation
[7:32:10] JoeayIV: try the other way now
[7:32:10] UmbrellaFox: or 88.57
[7:32:12] JoeayIV: 88.57
[7:32:20] JoeayIV: lines up a little better
[7:32:21] UmbrellaFox: probably that one
[7:32:32] klaunns: that should be 1.43 then
[7:32:32] JoeayIV: hold on
[7:32:38] UmbrellaFox: 1.43 or -1.43
[7:32:44] nobodybodon: pausecham maff
[7:32:44] JoeayIV: yea
[7:32:50] CreatureBruhh: left window is further out than right
[7:32:56] happy_questionmark: i like turtles
[7:33:05] UmbrellaFox: middle should be 133.57
[7:33:08] JoeayIV: 1.43 or -1.43 or the left window
[7:33:11] nobodybodon: Probably a weed sale KEKW
[7:33:13] JoeayIV: and middle should be 133.57
[7:33:16] klaunns: left window 1.43, mid window 133.57
[7:33:28] jimothy64: Good ol' 133.57 back again lol
[7:33:46] UmbrellaFox: ashlolCool
[7:33:47] JoeayIV: for once
[7:33:52] JoeayIV: i math'ed right
[7:33:59] nobodybodon: Congratulations
[7:34:00] happy_questionmark: how are they getting these number? eeeh
[7:34:02] UmbrellaFox: left one forward a tad?
[7:34:05] retrowolf0498: I made por life choices. I got ice cream, it's 1AM. Guess who's going to struggle to sleep tonight
[7:34:08] klaunns: nice math people
[7:34:16] JoeayIV: @happy_questionmark xee said the house is tilted 1.43 degrees
[7:34:16] UmbrellaFox: NODDERS that looks perfect
[7:34:24] UmbrellaFox: jeez
[7:34:24] JoeayIV: so you gotta rotate everything by that
[7:34:28] JoeayIV: to line up with straight lines
[7:34:31] happy_questionmark: @JoeayIV ohhh
[7:34:46] JoeayIV: its taking a lot of brain power to like
[7:34:48] StreamElements: Nakkida's YT is here! Don't forget to subscribe and smash that like button pepeLaugh https://www.youtube.com/c/Nakkida
[7:34:51] JoeayIV: do the numbers
[7:34:56] Azure505: Z position should match between all 3, right?
[7:34:57] UmbrellaFox: how did they find out the tilt to the house LUL
[7:35:08] jimothy64: Dev stuff @umbrellafox
[7:35:19] UmbrellaFox: ah, makes sense.  just looked at the grid
[7:35:22] nobodybodon: nodd dev hax
[7:35:35] JoeayIV: i bet Xee has a protractor
[7:35:37] JoeayIV: 100%
[7:35:53] happy_questionmark: it's too bad the list doesn't have the frame you need FeelsBadMan
[7:35:54] JoeayIV: also can probably see the world axis super easy and line it up
[7:36:05] apairidox: They dont Have a Bay window Frame that will fit?
[7:36:10] UmbrellaFox: calculated the tilt with his albacus
[7:36:29] UmbrellaFox: abacus*
[7:36:31] JoeayIV: you need a good ole hexagon
[7:36:32] nobodybodon: you bozo, you need a sextant for that
[7:36:33] JoeayIV: but cut in half
[7:36:38] nobodybodon: a trapezoid
[7:36:42] JoeayIV: no no
[7:36:44] JoeayIV: a hexagon
[7:36:46] JoeayIV: cut in half
[7:36:57] UmbrellaFox: a triangle?
[7:36:58] nobodybodon: Madge
[7:36:58] JoeayIV: completely different
[7:37:06] nobodybodon: your face is different
[7:37:13] JoeayIV: thank you!
[7:37:28] JoeayIV: 133.57
[7:37:31] JoeayIV: for z
[7:37:33] JoeayIV: - that is
[7:37:39] jimothy64: Just hide the Void with scatter cushions lol
[7:37:59] JoeayIV: wait is that wrong
[7:38:04] nobodybodon: as crooked as tessa
[7:38:14] JoeayIV: THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME
[7:38:25] UmbrellaFox: 136.43?
[7:38:32] JoeayIV: I HATE IT HERE
[7:38:43] happy_questionmark: sell the house Kappa
[7:38:44] ThatSoKyuRo: just turn the window into a pirate ship’s walking plank LUL
[7:38:46] JoeayIV: BUT THE WINDOW
[7:38:50] UmbrellaFox: just putting the 1.43 on the wrong end
[7:38:51] JoeayIV: FUCKING
[7:39:05] JoeayIV: oh
[7:39:10] JoeayIV: did you do those rotations
[7:39:11] Azure505: possible the whole house isn't square yeah
[7:39:12] JoeayIV: on world or local?
[7:39:38] JoeayIV: THIS STREAM IS A PRISON
[7:39:44] jimothy64: Solid chance the interior doesn't have perfect 90° corners lol
[7:39:48] nobodybodon: 7 hours of decorating changes a person
[7:39:54] sanzonw: BLANKIES BLANKIES BLANKIES
[7:39:57] JoeayIV: i will say this
[7:40:05] nobodybodon: @JoeayIV ok flop
[7:40:07] JoeayIV: this isn't as bad as the hard drive fiasco
[7:40:14] nobodybodon: are you gonna be honest about it too?
[7:40:36] JoeayIV: could you do like
[7:40:40] JoeayIV: a bench or some shit
[7:40:45] happy_questionmark: would you see that bottom part outside?
[7:40:55] apairidox: can you search for Bay window
[7:40:58] ThatSoKyuRo: what about indoor planter box?
[7:41:25] Azure505: @happy_questionmark all of the interior stuff should unload when you go outside, so there shouldn't be any issues like that
[7:41:52] UmbrellaFox: but possible!
[7:41:54] happy_questionmark: @Azure505 oh ok that's good
[7:42:15] JoeayIV: just trying to think of objects that are kind flat
[7:42:21] ThatSoKyuRo: planter box?
[7:42:24] jimothy64: It's the main reason I really don't like the "everything has a material cost" approach. Kills creative decorating. Make useful things cost, aesthetic things free.
[7:42:46] happy_questionmark: just put a sheet of plywood in front of the bay window.. done Kappa
[7:43:09] NovaCraft818: Hope they implement sizing the objects
[7:43:47] apairidox: Maybe one of those curved shelfs
[7:44:02] happy_questionmark: the editor is really cool but it seems difficult
[7:45:13] JoeayIV: its close tho
[7:45:14] JoeayIV: so close
[7:45:18] StreamElements: Feel free to join my Discord flock, 5000 members and growing! https://discordapp.com/invite/nakkida
[7:45:21] jimothy64: Any loose cushions?
[7:45:23] ThatSoKyuRo: you could try planter boxes, chest, or slabs?
[7:45:28] JoeayIV: need a good loveseat
[7:45:33] klaunns: is there like pet beds
[7:45:46] JoeayIV: but i mean
[7:45:50] JoeayIV: that might fit?
[7:45:54] tfw_badfeel: that looks cozy
[7:46:01] JoeayIV: 43.57 or 46.43 i think
[7:46:06] JoeayIV: for the Z
[7:46:26] sanzonw: that looks almost good
[7:46:34] JoeayIV: to be fair, outside of a bench this part likely will be the most expensive
[7:46:40] JoeayIV: just cuz of the shape
[7:46:50] klaunns: i mean, u guys work with jenny n mick right KEKW
[7:46:59] JoeayIV: i think 43 yea
[7:47:05] klaunns: surely they can work with you guys
[7:47:23] JoeayIV: can you like
[7:47:32] JoeayIV: tilt it inwards a little?
[7:47:34] happy_questionmark: does it tell you how much it is?
[7:47:40] JoeayIV: to avoid the clipping bit
[7:47:45] sleepybear2705: Any idea about koil ? Haven't seen Franny in a while?
[7:47:51] JoeayIV: SLIGHTLY
[7:47:55] JoeayIV: A LITTLE
[7:48:01] klaunns: KEKW
[7:48:02] JoeayIV: nah yea
[7:48:23] JoeayIV: honestly i think its the least scuffed solution for this spot tho
[7:48:31] apairidox: LoL window  or the couch not centered
[7:48:42] CreatureBruhh: if only you could make stuff scale up and down...

[7:54:39] JoeayIV: X shouldn't need the decimal
[7:55:05] JoeayIV: what did you just do
[7:55:16] JoeayIV: ??????
[7:55:19] happy_questionmark: if only you could snap things to a grid but then i guess the house wouldn't be on a grid
[7:55:23] DJayEnzyme: x should be 135?
[7:55:45] ThatSoKyuRo: well I would have broke my mouse and keyboard by now soooo ur doing great 👍 LUL
[7:56:46] JoeayIV: ITS CROOKED
[7:56:49] JoeayIV: IDK
[7:57:01] JoeayIV: BRO IDK
[7:57:05] happy_questionmark: create a new one maybe?
[7:57:07] ReiSundae: House is haunted
[7:57:11] JoeayIV: ????????????
[7:57:22] ThatSoKyuRo: @nakkida maybe it just want to be crooked ok 👌 LUL
[7:57:24] DJayEnzyme: leave X at 0 and do z at 45?
[7:57:30] klaunns: so.. now we change Z to 133.57
[7:57:30] LissaB: 43.57 on the z rotation and 0 on the x and y I think
[7:57:35] JoeayIV: okay
[7:57:37] JoeayIV: things have changed
[7:57:48] JoeayIV: 43.57 or 46.43
[7:57:48] Arkwendris: I think its cause its on world
[7:57:49] JoeayIV: for Z
[7:57:49] sir_somelongname: Maybe cos the player is standing at the angle so its being placed at that angle
[7:58:05] Arkwendris: it looks diagonal for some reason
[7:58:07] IosefSerov: Obviously Tessa is crooked, so it stands to reason everything you are looking at is also crooked. 🤔
[7:58:13] VzzionFourEyes: whats the other bannister at. Take that number to work with
[7:58:17] UmbrellaFox: @JoeayIV NODDERS
[7:58:22] tfthighrollonly: Both you and Ramee have been stuck on the first floor for 3 hrs haha

[8:00:07] JoeayIV: now it matches
[8:00:20] JoeayIV: like

[8:21:54] jimothy64: It's just objectively worse for creativity and individuality now.
[8:21:56] ThatSoKyuRo: i think just having like wood,cloth, ect instead of needing a actual sofa just the material on hand would seem better

[8:22:31] JoeayIV: the numbers are haunted
[8:23:02] happy_questionmark: how do you feel about them not having any walls, floors, frames..?
[8:23:02] jimothy64: Think about all that wall art the morph people would do in 3.0... those would be impossibly expensive to do now.

[8:24:34] JoeayIV: Bjorn is still sitting on the sofa
[8:24:35] jimothy64: You want a sofa, that should be free. You want a sofa that has some mechanical benefit, that should cost.
