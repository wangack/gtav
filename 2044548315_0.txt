[0:29:24] vipersummer: im sure you would know if she was a hybrd or not but that size seems overly large
[0:29:45] jimothy64: Worked out what happened with the Surge btw; the normal surge is based on a Chevy Volt, the new model is based on the Chevy Bolt.. there's a solid chance when looking for references for the updated model they grabbed the wrong car :P
[0:30:07] vipersummer: yeah, thats why i said im sure you would know... thats just a massive gecko
[0:30:37] retrowolf0498: I wish I could watch tomorrow, but the official start of the 2024 motorsport season starts tomorrow. 24 Hours of cars on track.

[0:34:26] krstee: um, that would be a noooo for me...
[0:34:35] reservedcorn: RODENTS LIKE A RAT???
[0:34:44] JoeayIV: as long as you get treated
[0:34:44] jimothy64: My mom is seriously arachnophobic, which means I was essentially raised as an arachnophobe.. can't be dealing with spiders, especially the big ones.
[0:34:45] JoeayIV: right?
[0:34:50] milehighhezz: i used to have a tarantula named Peter
[0:34:56] CatGotYourKeyboard: I would have a heart attack...so, deadly to me. ;)
[0:35:00] ApocAFK: Brown Recluses are scary af

[0:35:26] darthdin: are black widows deadly to humans or just to its mates?
[0:35:28] reservedcorn: I honestly tolerate spiders more than Snakes
[0:35:29] JoeayIV: nakkiCheer thank
[0:35:33] vipersummer: exactly! i have 7 of the 10 most venomous tarantulas in my collection including 1# and even that one would just ruin my week
[0:35:37] 80sHairMetalFan: Obi nakkiAw
[0:35:56] Lalle87: If a spider the size of a dinner plate entered my house, I guess he would be the new owner.
[0:36:15] macman385: i think black widows have the highest chance to kill in the states?
[0:36:16] CatGotYourKeyboard: @Lalle87 NODDERS
[0:36:20] vipersummer: it will make it feel like your bones are trying to break themselves but a Black Widow unless you have a bad reaction will not kill you
[0:36:35] milehighhezz: my friend got bit by a spider and they had top like carve out the chunk all around the bite from his hand. it was brutal.
[0:36:54] ApocAFK: Are Brown Recluses not more fatal? Hmmm @macman385 I figured they are the most common that cause necrosis
[0:36:55] JWuwee: nakkiHello
[0:37:03] retrowolf0498: They're more irritating than anything. Sometimes painful.
[0:37:08] jimothy64: Just keep an eye out for anaphylaxis and necrosis and you're set.
[0:37:24] macman385: @ApocAFK yeah they have nasty side effects too, im in indiana so its only the BR spiders here to worry about
[0:37:27] zero_huffelflops_given: Sorry for interrupting your animal talk - but how does Tessa feel today after the decision yesterday?
[0:37:42] vipersummer: if my Poecilotheria metallica were to bite me it would be similar to a black widow only the symptoms can last up to a week
[0:38:27] retrowolf0498: Probably going to be about the same as it was when she was Game Warden
[0:38:31] zero_huffelflops_given: Does she have any plans for today?
[0:38:38] JoeayIV: to buy the Baller

[0:40:23] JoeayIV: just peep into dev chat and ask for a single moped to be in stock at a specific hour
[0:40:26] JoeayIV: ezpz
[0:40:34] ApocAFK: uh oh

[3:43:30] thegrandgeneral3: Tessa going to mention the house offer up in Paleto to Juno?
[3:43:51] nobodybodon: not in front of max

[3:54:40] CatGotYourKeyboard: Oh yep. He's the inspiration for the name.
[3:54:47] Jen848: @CatGotYourKeyboard My last cat was named Housekeeping. It was hilarious when we went to the vet because they call the pet's name instead of the owner's when it's time for their appointment. Everybody would laugh.
[3:55:06] CatGotYourKeyboard: That's amazing, @Jen848 nakkiKEKS

[4:32:01] thegrandgeneral3: And Juno wants Tessa to be roommates with her up there too.
[4:32:36] Anhellzer: something like The Guild probably
[4:32:38] JoeayIV: like i say
[4:32:43] JoeayIV: Tessa gonna end up with keys to two houses
[4:32:59] JoeayIV: just so happens shes gonna be neighbours with herself
[4:33:10] Anhellzer: and while at it u can find a group too, u never know
[4:33:23] jimothy64: With the Pet Store thing... getting Damien for Paleto Pets experience and maybe Kiki to incorporate veterinary care would be solid.. easier to sell "contracted to visit a vet" if you're also establishing a vet..
[4:33:52] vipersummer: Tessa would get to interact with Andi more up there
[4:33:55] vipersummer: thats a plus
[4:34:13] Darth_hedgehog: Kirk

[4:41:30] jimothy64: I'm just remembering the ill-fated agricultural businesses in 3.0... all the restaurants did it themselves so the businesses died
[4:42:16] Rekonin: Put sails on the lighthouse, turn it in to a windmill, start making pasta/pizza flour
[4:42:36] IIIIHELLIIII: At the sqaure if I remember correctly
[4:43:25] JoeayIV: burgershot didn't either at the start of 3.0 no?
[4:43:39] jimothy64: I do wonder how much it would cost for the Pet Store...  get some solid investment from trusted people involved in 3.0 pet stuff...
[4:43:51] Jen848: maybe they'll create trucking jobs where they deliver to restaurants
[4:44:05] jimothy64: Kiki for vet stuff, Damien, probably a few others
[4:44:11] roadtoknowhere_: materials is bad enough, now farming
