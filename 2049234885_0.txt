[7:32:33] fublian: Have you check newspaper? they used to have a Money column
[7:32:54] timesealer623: holy
[7:32:58] fublian: Maybe not in 4.0 but a while back
[7:33:17] Sword_Scream: The stocks are rough on NP though. You're paying a service fee when buying and a tax when selling. You'd need a rather large gain for it to be profitable.
[7:33:19] tzloaf: dont look at the real life stocks right now LUL
[7:33:20] franciscooo25: is tanking hard
[7:33:32] martymagoo78: got to cover the buy and sell fees before any profit too
[7:34:07] fublian: That is CRAZY with how little they are moving
[7:34:14] Sword_Scream: Yeah, you have to buy at dips and be willing to wait it out.
[7:34:18] RECOvfmrcentrist: that is very high
[7:34:22] Sword_Scream: Basically only invest money you don't have a need for short term
[7:34:22] tzloaf: your 93 needs to turn into 102 or more to make profit
[7:34:50] OriginalGibsta: COPIUM
[7:35:04] Sword_Scream: If you bought at 103, It needs to hit... I think it's 115 before you've made profit
[7:35:11] xItzSmoke: we're growing rn ?
[7:35:12] Sword_Scream: or else you're in the red afterwards
[7:35:43] fublian: Even if you do that, you are better of just lending the money to someone or somethign with small interest
[7:36:03] martymagoo78: having to make 10% plus cover and other shares that reduced seems a lot. depends if you have anything else you want to spend money on instead Tbf
[7:36:18] franciscooo25: Did you find out what the harvesting kit was for?
[7:36:43] sunnyplease: sell fee is brutal
[7:36:49] fublian: If you could use BUT to hack some sort of stock site and see what is about to grow would be cool
[7:36:52] Sword_Scream: Basically, see a stock dipping real low? Throw money in there you won't need for a while. Buying when it's kinda stagnant seems risky, with how the stocks work on there.
[7:37:12] difficultsleep3r: Do you get dividends for holding?
[7:37:18] dumpster_diner: they're always gonna take 10% of sale
[7:37:26] Sword_Scream: Also I wonder if RP scenarios could have an effect on Stockprices.
[7:37:39] dumpster_diner: ok 5%
[7:37:45] sunnyplease: You never know when they will change it could be a huge payday down the line
[7:37:47] rhyan_19: newpapers have news about stocks
[7:38:08] dumpster_diner: not as bad but that total grows along with your gains
[7:38:12] plutr0nium: In GTA V I used to invest in Sprunk and then go around smashing the other brand vending machines to make it go up.

[7:39:15] joshbankai: Brown gonna blow up all the non Ron Oil gas stuff Kappa
[7:39:37] Sword_Scream: I think at 115, if you bought at 103, is your break even point
[7:40:18] Sword_Scream: As long as you don't sell the stocks, you technically haven't lost on it.
[7:40:31] Nightbot: If you have Amazon Prime you can sub to Harry for FREE, just go to https://twitch.amazon.com/prime activate it, come back and subscribe free of charge.
[7:40:31] TwitchesFishBowl: That’s called “dollar cost averaging”
[7:40:55] fublian: Feels like they will rework the stocks honestly. since it is just "gambling" right now. Sure they wanna add some way of predicting smarter or influencing it
[7:41:05] rhyan_19: check newspapers for stocks
[7:41:17] coinve: Dost Cost Average in and put in a little bit of money each day inside all of all. hOPEFULLY IT WILL GO DOWN and it will average your price lower

[7:41:43] herr_line: instead of buying 100$ today, you buy 1$ over 100 days
[7:41:46] bigpredictable: it was wild, looke like a flip book
[7:41:52] tzloaf: lump sum investing has always beaten dollar cost averaging, over the long run
[7:41:53] fublian: Gabling where the casino takes 10% pretty much, seems not worth it
[7:41:55] ForgetMidnight: FeelsLagMan
[7:41:55] Sword_Scream: Getting close to where people travel a lot. Might be all of the garbage people throw on the ground
[7:42:11] Jjiano: DCA-ing is just buying more stocks at lower prices than your highest to eventually lower your overall cost price per stock
[7:42:35] bonedead: buy a mega shit ton and sell when it goes up a bunch
[7:42:48] x_glazier_x: have to buy and sell in large share amounts

[7:43:35] tzloaf: When you sell is it 5% of the purchase price or current price?
[7:43:49] goodtimes54: 10.3
[7:43:54] noelgnal: always check EBITA before buying harrCOPE
[7:43:57] Niktory: 10.3 not 13
[7:44:09] fublian: Seems like the small amount of profit you would make, would be worth less than jsut being able to buy other stuf with the money now when its worth more
[7:44:15] fifthty: so you can get the average bought price for all the purchases and as long as youre 5% over that your good
[7:44:21] JonnyTruelove: monkaMath
