[4:06:40] brainbosh: I mean ONE of those makes money lol
[4:06:43] if0rg0t2remember: and one would be a choice for your own character and the other is helping the club when they need it
[4:06:44] BionicShoulder: strategic risk avoidance
[4:06:46] AntiochChouteau: You did really well in that chase!
[4:06:47] Nightbot: Follow Kate on Instagram! instagram.com/kate.ttv
[4:06:55] CAYKE__: the chase had already started so thus youre were screwed
[4:07:00] doc_sharon: you did SO good in the chase
[4:07:21] CAYKE__: that chase was clean AF
[4:07:23] AshuraX13: You drove that really cleanly
[4:07:26] doc_sharon: we do need some routes, but your driving was very good NODDERS
[4:07:30] CAYKE__: ye
[4:07:35] CAYKE__: you were running in a seminole
[4:07:36] CAYKE__: KEKW
[4:07:41] laxwall11: You just need a better car and some practice with routes
[4:07:41] hecktobreakfast: @Gobukiller I'm not jinxing it! We're listening to "Girl From Ipanema" and just vibing.
[4:07:44] CAYKE__: and didnt get caught in 30 sec
[4:07:45] Saydiejayne: and the car took a real beating
[4:07:45] AshuraX13: Plus 3 people in the car
[4:07:50] BleedingToast: why were you being chased?
[4:07:51] ElectronicChaos: Yeah, a better car and you'd have been out
[4:07:54] deathfrombelow7707: Maybe crime school when Lane is gone
[4:07:58] Crafty_Crystal: just more turns and a faster car and it will be easy
[4:08:05] MaxxEMoose: you definitely OJ’d through the south side
[4:08:06] doc_sharon: yeah we need some places to VCB Yesyes
[4:08:12] MyNameisTiff_: The fact the chase lasted as long as it did while in a damaged Seminole is hella respectable.
[4:08:13] tyrelrahl: When the chase got slower Maxx seemed to do better.  It very much reminded me of Muriel dusting cops at 30 mph lol
[4:08:18] UppyFF: if you get hit by a car… Tom did this katesShrug
[4:08:20] if0rg0t2remember: yeah a few good routes would have made a difference since you were driving clean. How long the chase went on is proof the driving was clean
[4:08:22] Gobukiller: @Gobukiller Look, we're just out here loudly discussing opinions about food
[4:08:33] Crafty_Crystal: you drove great
[4:08:34] GrumpyPanduh: CrabRave
[4:08:37] hecktobreakfast: You did really well considering. Besides, going slow probably made things more difficult with the cops. They panic when it's not blistering speeds.
[4:08:49] rickbuh: you also didn't even sit on many gateways for the last half of 3.0, you'll get a chance to learn them
[4:08:55] laxwall11: Man I remember him just like spending an hour at the start practicing those runs
[4:08:57] doc_sharon: meh - it was super fun, and the cops had a blast, too
[4:09:10] sandrabullock__: one of my favorite moments from yesterday's chase was when you got out of the cuffs and stole the officer's glasses at the same time foolsKEKW
[4:09:17] doc_sharon: NODDERS
[4:09:27] GenuineMind: I remember the epic run where you didnt admit to being there

[4:09:52] doc_sharon: it's a good way to approach it NODDERS
[4:09:53] Carbonfated: in 3.0 the chase with Candy durning clown day was pretty epic
[4:10:04] doc_sharon: and if we get out - BONUS Yesyes
[4:10:05] witchmina: it was super fun katesBongo

[5:36:55] if0rg0t2remember: many snakes will refuse anything that isn't actually body temp too
[5:37:06] Siirika: @doc_sharon Usually only if they're sick, or just not eating for some reason though. most of them are okay with just dead/frozen ones

[7:30:06] doc_sharon: the steps are nice NODDERS
[7:30:07] mister_nibbles: honestly thats a really good group of things that has to be done, i love how complex it is
[7:30:10] Kthanid: Money Run/VU cleaning with tax is kinda the end point of most criminal money.
[7:30:14] laxwall11: I love all the steps
[7:30:16] AshuraX13: Skill Twins
[7:30:21] Siirika: Had a couple right?
[7:30:23] doc_sharon: and people can outsource steps if they don't want to do them NODDERS for RP
[7:30:25] kangg: this is a 6 step process
[7:30:34] AshuraX13: Gone and Found from Skill Twins
[7:30:36] doc_sharon: katesJam katesJam katesJam katesJam
[7:30:43] Siirika: Wasn't it the same one you based the intro song on?
[7:30:49] A_Humble_Wooper: katesJam katesJam katesJam
[7:30:51] KarnEvil: i can hear the song in my head, but IDK what it was called.
[7:31:03] kangg: it’s literally a money racquet
[7:31:03] mister_nibbles: yeah it would be very difficult to do these things solo, it really encourages groups
[7:31:04] doc_sharon: Raiders had different teams doing different steps at the same time the other day NODDERS
[7:31:07] if0rg0t2remember: @KarnEvil same that is why I called it the boosting song lol
[7:31:30] Drinnar: at some point down the line, I can see groups selling stuff at a discount to avoid all the steps to clean too
[7:31:33] doc_sharon: I like that you all do them in teams Yesyes
[7:31:40] doc_sharon: katesCheer katesCheer katesCheer katesCheer
[7:32:05] mister_nibbles: is there shooty/stabby or cop danger on this?
[7:32:17] frsttyyy: that car just zooms huh
[7:32:18] rickbuh: plus it encourages working together this way, learning comms on baby stuff
[7:32:29] Kthanid: Also a flagged car.
[7:32:29] doc_sharon: but no shooty locals NODDERS
[7:32:52] mister_nibbles: ahh the old 10k+ transaction gets you investigated katesGiggles
[7:33:05] if0rg0t2remember: yeah its a flagged car as far as we know so if they get pulled over otherwise away from a bank it won't be good
[7:33:17] Kthanid: Cops are also kinda centralized in the city and they rarely go north.
[7:34:07] doc_sharon: katesSteer
[7:34:16] MiranFurz: also pawn might be low heat right now because it is up nourth
[7:34:19] AshuraX13: katesGiggle
[7:34:20] kx07stitch: money pleaseee lol
[7:34:35] IchibaToll: It's an AC/DC detector
[7:34:38] if0rg0t2remember: do we know if the pawn run cars are flagged yet?
[7:34:58] A_Humble_Wooper: Makes sense.
[7:35:21] AshuraX13: NODDERS
[7:35:23] doc_sharon: NODDERS
[7:35:26] if0rg0t2remember: its nice at least that the pawn cars vary and aren't always the same like the money cars
[7:35:27] A_Humble_Wooper: Yeah, that's always possible too.
[7:35:44] doc_sharon: wegion NODDERS
[7:35:50] AshuraX13: Like the Stable doing their meth run and getting a one car response NODDERS
[7:35:56] if0rg0t2remember: as far as we've seen its always this car

[7:42:19] Nightbot: MaxxEMoose: 8/12; 2/6; 1/3
[7:42:22] Kthanid: Yeah imagine a whole new 4.0 boosting.
[7:42:28] MaxxEMoose: ok
[7:42:39] A_Humble_Wooper: Almost every crime that's a carryover from 3.0 has totally different mechanics this time, yeah. NODDERS
[7:42:43] Kthanid: with like 4 steps like money cleaning? Yes please?
[7:42:44] MiranFurz: the new hacks seem real good
[7:42:50] doc_sharon: remember the orginal original chop in 3.0?  With the list of cars? KEKW
[7:43:02] hecktobreakfast: well nancy didn't really get to dive deep into crime either. so having maxx is awesome so you can dive right in.
[7:43:03] Siirika: Someone mentioned it was leaked Boosting or something similar would come back so yeah, katesBongo as to whats changed if/when that happens!

[7:43:39] if0rg0t2remember: have you done the lockpick yet?
[7:43:46] A_Humble_Wooper: Coulda gone a LOT differently yeah.
[7:43:51] laxwall11: Buddha said it would be in at some point
[7:43:55] hecktobreakfast: oh that would have been fire
[7:44:10] NotAMachine: TableHere FlipThis
[7:44:54] A_Humble_Wooper: NODDERS Yeah, just needs more practice.
[7:45:02] doc_sharon: EZ Clap
[7:45:02] if0rg0t2remember: boosting was fun, though I think they need to make sure if there are conversions that it doesn't flood the market with high end cars
[7:45:22] Siirika: ngl, I'm so happy they went hella diverse with the new 4.0 hacks, more room for diff people to do hacks that fit them
[7:45:36] doc_sharon: same @Siirika
[7:46:03] Kthanid: I think just boosting for cash at least at first is best. or for parts or something.
[7:46:07] rickbuh: I feel like conversation broke things, scratches would have been really good for job cars
[7:46:14] doc_sharon: even things like limited car restocks have been great Yesyes
[7:46:17] A_Humble_Wooper: Everybody had the best fancy car they could dream, from whatever options the city had.
[7:46:22] lorddracnor: only thing I hope gets flooded in 4.0 is the sewers katesDevil
[7:46:24] Kthanid: Like imagine boosting a high end car and ripping the parts out to upgrade your personal car.
[7:46:25] brainbosh: I mean why do crime when you have money honestly
[7:46:32] AshuraX13: Not having things give people goals NODDERS
[7:46:38] doc_sharon: EZ Clap
[7:46:40] A_Humble_Wooper: Clap
[7:46:41] hecktobreakfast: @Siirika yes! and it felt like they started to taylor the hacks to a small handful of people, only making things more difficult and exclusive.
[7:46:42] Nightbot: Follow Kate on Instagram! instagram.com/kate.ttv

[8:29:29] if0rg0t2remember: @AziraphalesShop it is a first gen Golf, called a Club in game
[8:29:58] Cordilia: fill up
[8:30:17] Crafty_Crystal: Nancy started out poor and in a gang too. She wasn’t magically rich, incase people didn’t see early 3.0 Nancy.
[8:30:42] if0rg0t2remember: Nancy started as a taxi driver with a brookly accent lol
[8:30:48] if0rg0t2remember: her growth was incredible
[8:30:58] Carbonfated: still praying for Bev as old lady
[8:31:06] lorddracnor: She won
[8:31:08] kangg: tobiiiSipspin tobiiiSipspin tobiiiSipspin
[8:31:32] Crafty_Crystal: 3.0 lasted too long for a lot of people
[8:31:34] AshuraX13: A really cool raccoon and a sick cloak and mask NODDERS
[8:31:40] mister_nibbles: its weird how the more money one has the more likely people are to just give them things katesCheck
[8:32:12] UppyFF: so much crime wow katesL
[8:32:30] mister_nibbles: yeahh
[8:32:40] Crafty_Crystal: yep which is wild
[8:32:41] doc_sharon: the fact that we did not even know Michael was around today was telling KEKW
[8:32:46] Kthanid: I did NOT have the Simone family being the more problematic group, NGL.
[8:32:48] Hoocairz: The beauty of two characters is avoiding sani grind
[8:32:51] IchibaToll: It's also great because Maxx and Veronica are both affiliated with groups where the RPers behind them totally understand that you're not full time on one or the other.
[8:32:58] A_Humble_Wooper: Yeah, I thought so too.
[8:32:58] The_Lesser_Gatsby: V just wants to sell furniture
[8:33:15] Kthanid: Sell furniture and save lives.
[8:33:21] mister_nibbles: speaking of secret rooms in the house i fell asleep before yall got back there, did you go back in to it?
[8:33:22] if0rg0t2remember: funny thing is it flopped. Simone house seemed like it was going to be easy and then it just wasn't
[8:33:22] Crafty_Crystal: yes!
[8:33:24] Hoocairz: LOL
[8:33:26] Carbonfated: the Simones do over react
[8:33:27] Hoocairz: Yes
[8:33:28] doc_sharon: the talks are long, and yet they somehow also do not talk to each other KEKW
[8:33:35] Kthanid: Yeah, the Raiders are a very well run ship for the most part.
[8:33:39] AshuraX13: Beautiful day to sell furniture... I mean save lives
[8:33:43] ElectronicChaos: Raiders frontloaded all the internal drama katesGiggle
[8:33:44] MaxxEMoose: Too many cooks, too many cooks katesSong
[8:33:49] if0rg0t2remember: yeah lots of talking not a lot of communicating in the Simone house
[8:33:50] Naneek17: lade KEKW
[8:33:58] Insaif: I think that's the difference. The Simone's don't have leadership or a common focus. katesShrug
[8:34:05] lorddracnor: Raiders found their stride
[8:34:09] laxwall11: Raiders have hit a stride this past week
[8:34:09] A_Humble_Wooper: And there's one more Raider we haven't met yet, who'll be around eventually once their IRL schedule frees up a bit.
[8:34:15] mister_nibbles: I love Tom and Wally
[8:34:21] doc_sharon: also people are wanting to work without being asked to NODDERS that is nice
[8:34:47] Kthanid: DIsjointed, bad comms, clashing personality traits etc.
[8:34:51] if0rg0t2remember: the Jenny Michael relationship is confusing too
[8:34:58] Insaif: NODDERS
[8:35:14] Siirika: With the question Dahlia asked Nick about Fam/Crew/Gang at the end today, MAYBE that's a good sign for improvement there
[8:35:48] if0rg0t2remember: NIKEA kinda manifested some purpose but it doesn't seem everyone is all in on it either
[8:36:17] IchibaToll: Those in the Simone house almost know each other too well.  Everyone cares, everyone has their desires and opinions, everyone wants to have input, but there's no natural leader to set the tone.
[8:36:45] Nightbot: Follow Kate on Instagram! instagram.com/kate.ttv
[8:36:56] Kthanid: Yeah some people also just want to RP it out purely in city.
[8:37:20] doc_sharon: oop
[8:37:52] NoodleCubed: I could see Reggie also being like "Nick would not want me putting that in writing"
[8:38:24] doc_sharon: katesCheck
[8:38:34] doc_sharon: checking the area
[8:38:41] AshuraX13: katesEyes
[8:38:53] kangg: tobiiiBino
[8:39:15] tresbizarre: We're scouting
[8:39:48] if0rg0t2remember: I hope there is some purpose to it that seems legit not just hiding it from the house
[8:39:53] AshuraX13: Saususge
[8:39:55] doc_sharon: katesPlot
[8:40:37] doc_sharon: I'm looking forward to the talk with Reggie Yesyes
[8:41:05] Insaif: NODDERS It does seem that way.
[8:41:07] A_Humble_Wooper: katesShrug
[8:41:27] Crafty_Crystal: Is the old V lore that you alluded before to still going to come out or was it retconned?
[8:41:32] Siirika: If it is Seaside stuff, would it just be BenjiPTSD? katesGiggles
[8:41:33] doc_sharon: it got a little glow up NODDERS
[8:41:36] Insaif: Nick also seems to have a habit of jumping to the worst case scenario of every situation. katesShrug
[8:41:40] Kthanid: Nick bless his heart is bad at making assumptions and running with it.  Not all the time, but some times.
[8:41:54] mister_nibbles: except when the world starts melting and everything starts looking like GTA III katesGiggles
[8:42:05] kangg: has the house picked a weed turf yet and started pushing? I haven’t heard anything on that particular topic
[8:42:10] doc_sharon: +1 Mason
[8:42:10] Kthanid: But that being said, MANY characters do that in the city.
[8:42:19] Naneek17: weed door dash
[8:42:28] spazzles: I've got a pretty beastly machine, can easily run vanilla GTA at max settings, and it does still look quite good.  it's not photorealistic or anything, but holy hell Rockstar did a good job
[8:42:48] Insaif: !song
[8:42:49] Nightbot: Cannons - Fire for You https://open.spotify.com/track/4o0LyB69tylqDG6eTGhmig
[8:43:31] abblepiewit: *hears song* ooh, Kate's starting stream! katesHypers katesGiggles
[8:43:33] Siirika: Esp because he also vocalizes those assumptions and cynisism pretty forcefully.
[8:44:07] rickbuh: its kind of a Nick and Michael move
[8:44:18] AshuraX13: NODDERS Walking out just shuts down all the communication
[8:44:35] A_Humble_Wooper: Especially if they won't pick up the phone afterward.
[8:44:42] Kthanid: Nikez is also really good at playing/RPing frustrated/angry, which throws my brain for a LOOP.
[8:44:45] lorddracnor: I'm just confused what the rest of the Simone house wants to do, like their goal.
[8:45:16] doc_sharon: oop
[8:45:18] Naneek17: o.o
[8:45:21] Hoocairz: But if I walk out without saying anything I can spring it back on you when you least expect it
[8:45:25] lorddracnor: It feels like they are just doing stuff to do it
[8:45:29] itGlenn: katesPalm
[8:45:51] polasr: LUL
[8:46:01] doc_sharon: katesEyes
[8:46:21] itGlenn: WeSmart

[8:47:01] itGlenn: NODDERS
[8:47:12] laxwall11: That's why Maxx is future road captain lol
[8:47:13] lorddracnor: NODDERS
[8:47:24] AshuraX13: Yes
[8:47:36] doc_sharon: Like when Nick said today he was too cooked for some of the convo, V and Dahlia were cool with that NODDERS
[8:47:36] lorddracnor: @laxwall11 don't put that evil on her katesGiggle
[8:47:58] Kthanid: Communicate and then remove yourself.
[8:48:11] doc_sharon: Some Valentines Day advice from Kate OKAY
[8:48:19] karmagetsyou69: i agree kate 100
[8:48:20] Kthanid: NODDERS
[8:48:21] A_Humble_Wooper: NODDERS
[8:48:24] doc_sharon: NODDERS
[8:48:28] itGlenn: NODDERS
[8:48:40] lorddracnor: yayup
[8:48:44] if0rg0t2remember: I think that is great advice to allow yourself space and feel your feels but not storm out.
[8:48:46] karmagetsyou69: NODDERS
[8:48:48] johnothetree: YEP
[8:49:02] rickbuh: all these cars that are blue and fast
[8:49:11] brainbosh: Even "I'm too mad to talk about this right now" is better than just leaving
[8:49:13] A_Humble_Wooper: Especially if you actually DO come back to it later. Shows you actually want to resolve stuff not ignore it till it goes away.
[8:49:56] MaxxEMoose: it’s hard when it’s all red, but way better to communicate first and go cool off
[8:50:45] MaxxEMoose: and please please don’t go to bed angry
[8:51:13] doc_sharon: katesSteer
[8:51:19] doc_sharon: EZ Clap
[8:51:22] AshuraX13: katesGiggle
[8:51:34] doc_sharon: not a bad run AT ALL
[8:51:42] doc_sharon: even with all the cops nearby KEKW
[8:51:55] mister_nibbles: and he was pushing the dank shit, so lots of rep too
[8:52:06] rickbuh: could have been Wade's 7 cop calls katesGiggle

[9:16:12] Insaif: @Kthanid It's also not cheap to get on the app, right. There's a cost to the chip you have to use for the tablet (Rue and Wade talked about it before with Maxx).
