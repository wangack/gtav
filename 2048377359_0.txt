[2:06:28] GladMit: the clip is eugene driving the truck LULW
[2:06:29] interfistin: I think the point they are making is that if Dundee was detached he could have made it detonate hence no attempted murders
[2:06:30] franky47: Lack of proof that the squad car detonated it means nothing - it's about proving how it blew up ok
[2:06:30] benr151998: they’re claiming a car hit the tanker and saying it was a squad car , your disproving them on a technicality when the sentinel could still have bumped the tanker
[2:06:30] angus1794: i opened fire ... put me in jail
[2:06:36] Vinmir: When in doubt, pin the blame on Cornwood
[2:06:36] zorbexrt: u had to either shoot it or run into it
[2:06:38] DanLGG: Eugene’s really gonna do something one day. everyone’s gonna snitch and PD isn’t gonna believe them deansoF
[2:06:42] hanixshah: before you there was others u mentioned so who was that ask them?
[2:06:43] drewsley: i dont think police are liable, but i dont think dundee is either
[2:06:45] Estidal: @interfistin I think the point that im making is STOP BACKSEATING

[3:02:08] yo_it_jo: very true buon
[3:02:16] yo_it_jo: you are a crazy person
[3:02:33] sBuon: @yo_it_jo what ever do you mean? ThisIsFine
[3:02:47] DanLGG: in theory yeah Dundee delivered the tanker but their argument is he didn’t blow it up but pd did. Which is a fair argument
[3:03:26] sBuon: @DanLGG you're a fair argument ltcustFlower
[3:03:45] themanwithanrx7: L hoppers lmao

[3:08:15] DiaBeetusKoby: SUNDAY
[3:08:28] MrHyde81: Based on the wording of the charge, isn't the fact that it exploded irreverent?
[3:08:31] SimplyOrt: simpler times Doomge
[3:08:44] PlethoraOfBees: That music was giving me " PepeHolmes *detective monologue* "vibes
[3:08:52] ZealousCrow: need to soundproof that room

[3:09:14] diurnambull86: PD is a hot spot today
[3:09:18] Tabah: Go get yourself some dinner sugar
[3:09:42] random_viewer_55: @MrHyde81 what do you mean exactly?
[3:09:58] sBuon: @PlethoraOfBees essaying "It was Mosley's ... that's where the case started... car parts everywhere.  Irwin Dundee in cuffs... Let me tell you the story of how it all went down..."
[3:10:05] random_viewer_55: @ZealousCrow it is soundproof, but I think the door needs to be locked for that
[3:10:21] random_viewer_55: it's meta if we answer you
[3:10:26] random_viewer_55: why he's asking that
[3:10:28] MrHyde81: @random_viewer_55 It is "placing the tanker at the scene". Nothing about it being set off.
[3:10:59] DiaBeetusKoby: @random_viewer_55 ever heard of thinking out loud?
[3:11:10] AlteredData: pepeSmoke
[3:11:25] SimplyOrt: @DiaBeetusKoby never
[3:11:36] PlethoraOfBees: @sBuon "His accent is like gravel in a blender, rough and jumbled, but I can still make out the desperation in every word. He's a man on the edge, teetering between defiance and defeat, but he's not ready to go down without a fight as he inhales and lets forth a boisterous ' BENCH TRIAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLL' " essaying
[3:11:51] DanLGG: bro this whole passed hour + has been insane
[3:12:09] sBuon: @PlethoraOfBees .... yo bees you a writer too wtf?
[3:12:33] DiaBeetusKoby: succulent bench TRIAAAAAAALLLLL

[3:14:51] Pravolution: Even if the PD shot it, he was the reason they were shooting and he put it there?
[3:14:59] PlethoraOfBees: @sBuon One time in high school my english teacher assigned an essay with 2 weeks to write it and said "Make a plan, make rough drafts, and work hard. You will not be able to do this one last minute" and I did it the night before and got an A EZ
[3:15:04] SerrikVorrik: kian just get phased up after jailing himself
[3:15:13] themanwithanrx7: in exchange for what?
[3:15:15] tattoodude: HUH

[3:16:35] TheBFG_01: AAAA the lack of forensic equipment actually stops that from happening
[3:16:35] Nightbot: AAAA
[3:17:05] sBuon: @Kittriss No contest isn't guilty. It's legally and BBMC legally different NODDERS
[3:17:21] Kittriss: Ohhhh
[3:17:31] VectorFalcon: Dundee will never plead guilty. He may choose to not contest the charges, but he will never plead guilty.
[3:17:39] DiaBeetusKoby: no contest just means “Im not gonna argue this in court”
[3:17:43] magnets_: every cop seems to love interacting with whippy. he takes Ls really well
[3:18:00] DanLGG: @pravolution intent would be a huge defining factor. They can prove what D has done in the past but can they prove he took the tanker there with the intent to explode blow it up. Gonna be a spicy court case. I look forward to it .
[3:19:02] ZealousCrow: wow brown nose on that lawyer
