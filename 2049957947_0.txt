[2:51:11] 0x800CCC0F: in 2013, twitch only had around 1/5 the users it has today, so naturally getting consistently to 75 concurrent views was much harder than

[2:52:04] LeoWurf: Actually I lied Everyone whos like 15 16 is influenced by the streaming spehere right now

[4:52:56] Rascal_PM: Labels manage your content basically
[4:52:58] m4l1kkk: You can negotiate better terms
[4:52:58] chmbrs: and what you can make
[4:53:00] macneutron: @feraldog7 AYOO
[4:53:03] Zunnun: Hell yes we taking that EZ
[4:53:08] DastealthyPablo: They usually hold on to 1 album a year
[4:53:15] m4l1kkk: Those are dookie terms, it's not always like that
[4:53:15] Rascal_PM: Its like if G2 manages your entire stream but you get paid from G2 not twitch
[4:53:19] feraldog7: @macneutron would you not?
[4:53:19] xRidd1er: finally the streets are safe again with Den and Aziz back
[4:53:20] Law524: i cant rap, fuck yea im takin it LOL
[4:53:20] robbie_gamz: yeah plus gives exposure and helps recording and any endorsement deals
[4:53:22] socialistchris: Depends on the leverage you have when you sign. New artists pretty much sign over their whole soul
[4:53:32] xxlonegunmanxx: Labels were good, before streaming. they used to handle distribution, but now the internet is the distribution network.
[4:53:33] m4l1kkk: Most rappers can't read so they get bad deals
[4:53:34] Zunnun: Free money i make some shit albums for money easily
[4:53:36] angel0fdeath2k: 10 mill minimum with the chance of only going up if the albums sell hard.
[4:53:45] xxlonegunmanxx: So whats the point of a lable?
[4:53:50] mrkingg77: I would do a 3 album deal for 3 mill.
[4:53:52] macneutron: @feraldog7 not for a milli
[4:54:02] Rascal_PM: @Zunnun doesnt work anymore, Frank ocean ruined that
[4:54:03] xsilas43: funding
[4:54:05] BDG_parth28: Yes
[4:54:05] robbie_gamz: yeah
[4:54:11] BDG_Toa676: Yep
[4:54:11] chmbrs: funding and exposure
[4:54:13] kindaskilld: Hi
[4:54:17] feraldog7: people in here making demands.. If you're starting to make music you will take any deal
[4:54:19] Zunnun: @mrkingg77 take the deal noone said the albums has to be good deansoP
[4:54:21] m4l1kkk: The labels front the money and control the machine
[4:54:21] 2Luke_6: thoughts on nba youngboy @deansocool ?
[4:54:22] DastealthyPablo: All you fees that you would need to make a song they pay for
[4:54:23] xRidd1er: they are used for studio marketing producers features
[4:54:34] Law524: id sign to an artist made label, not a big old head style label
[4:54:35] Gamenji: and brings together different kind of artists and music
[4:54:37] Rascal_PM: Labels do most marketing yes, but they also manage the data and catalog. They actually care more about the data from the listeners than the actual rapper performance now
[4:54:39] chmbrs: but nowadays if you post a song to tiktok and blow up, you dont need the funding from the labels
[4:54:40] robbie_gamz: "Existing network and connections: One significant benefit of signing with a label is their existing network. It can present major opportunities for you and your music. Without a label, your network and reach to larger audiences can be limited. Established labels will have a larger fanbase." - straight from safari
[4:54:40] d3fc0ngaming: so hard to buy a house in NP when you solo
[4:54:41] feraldog7: It's the same reason why video game developers get shafted. They are passionate about something, so their passion gets abused.
[4:54:43] m4l1kkk: Lonely Child is üî•
[4:54:44] 2Luke_6: house arrest tingz
[4:54:45] ChaoticSanity: labels do everything except sing the song tbh
[4:54:46] socialistchris: @xxlonegunmanxx basically signing away loads of money you generate and likely your masters to have someone else book things for you
[4:54:48] Zunnun: @rascal_pm dean didn't specify
[4:54:54] HaviiK: Ten talk
[4:54:56] mrkingg77: @Zunnun but still 10 albums is a ton of work if its shit or not LUL
[4:54:58] m4l1kkk: Diamond Teeth Samurai too
[4:55:14] xRidd1er: with a label you dont have to worry much about the business side of things but you can lose your creative freedom
[4:55:19] Rascal_PM: Labels care more about the advertisement data because of their deals with Pepsi and Coke, than they care about the quality of the music
[4:55:27] xRidd1er: independent you have to do it all yourself or hire them yourself
[4:55:31] BDG_Toa676: Also nowadays especially in drill they make more money when the artist dies
[4:55:31] m4l1kkk: Play your music for the stream
