[0:44:16] n0oxaskek: should depend where you hit the target tbh
[0:44:16] pieeka: 2 for knife
[0:44:17] Speeddevilx: i think they should have a rule to not do this level of crime before the storm every day its really bad rp. may be add an extra charge or something if caught @EsfandTV

[0:44:21] Icestruggler: https://clips.twitch.tv/AntsyProductiveBadgerAMPEnergyCherry-Ph6zeKAiz3giGaK0 that baton targeting to a person on the ground makes it soo stupid
[0:44:22] rossetk: Maybe a knock down and not knockout mechanic?
[0:44:23] DetoxBKG: Isn't baton supposed to less than lethal, ie. not knocking someone out?
[0:44:25] MackPlays: baton should be a stun not a knock out

[0:44:42] RyinTwitch: KKona
[0:44:43] Skypirinha4: @EsfandTV make knives throwable and if u manage to headshot its a one tab

[0:44:46] rfg_2098: KKona
[0:44:46] anthr00: It's realistic tho, ppl can take a few shots before realizing it but a major blow to the head with baton usually downs someone IRL

[0:45:01] MacVane: there is 0 reason in RP or otherwise to not use the gun
[0:45:01] DezalbM: yes but they're going to argue real life rp life
[0:45:02] SoIafar: to be fair its easier to RP meele weapons not damaging as much as a gun shot
[0:45:04] woahdudewhat: INSURRECTION KKonaW
[0:45:04] DiscretionaI: #Balance nerf batons

[0:45:15] Naphtax: he got so many KEKW
[0:45:16] aoc_bae: LULW
[0:45:18] n0oxaskek: @EsfandTV shouldnt it depend where target is hit how many hits you need?
[0:45:20] Toastedgamer03: because in real life guns are so scary to people that they can't be logical that the gameplay mechanic of batons are more dangerous
[0:45:21] TheSeamsy: True, but it's more comedic to have the random swings
[0:45:21] Jurgen___: why was bobby charles's dad running in
[0:45:21] akaMattikins: esfandCOPS he's got a knife

[0:45:45] Booyal: Why did they use baton though? Isn't the SOP to +1 their attack?
[0:45:49] EnvironNA: When you shoot a leg or arm they have a very high chance of death in real life lol
[0:45:50] LeastSuspicious: if the taser went further itd be the solution. Is that something the server devs can edit?
[0:45:53] n0oxaskek: wait a hit with a baton to the leg oneshots too?
[0:45:53] sixoddeight: GUN IS TO NEUTRALIZE THE THREAT
[0:45:55] bobbybedstains: its as realistic as it could be for fairness

[0:46:21] PandaNomsBamboo: Pog closing sale
[0:46:22] Nintail: That's like complaining about the Tsunami. IT's not realistic to have it everyday, but it's the mechanic for the server
[0:46:23] Xarisher: @EsfandTV If this happens just trip inside it usually fixes it
[0:46:23] NuJoisey: they need to develop a "beanbag" shotgun or something

[1:57:49] rangerkris: what is this shit
[1:57:55] EternalCoconut: @Gachiguru I guess, but cop cars should generally be a little clumsier at least, like the cars they have now steer more like what you would expect from cop cars. The chopper alone gives them a gigantic advantage, they don't even need to keep up with the cars to follow someone
[1:57:56] DaltonCL: tldr we dont know
[1:57:59] skedaddelr: @jonfett they just doing a discord call ooc

[1:58:21] Jurgen___: @jonfett i guess if we knew there wouldnt be a reason to not allow it to be streamed
[1:58:22] Oprichard9: all black Susge
[1:58:26] Gachiguru: @EternalCoconut thats why youd only chase for violent felonies or bank robberies

Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life‚Ä¶ He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.
