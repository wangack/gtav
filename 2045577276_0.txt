[1:16:22] A_Humble_Wooper: NODDERS
[1:16:23] Henshini: my wife switched banks for her business’s account recently and within a few weeks, the bank accidentally transferred a lot of money out of her account. my wife got it fixed but it was wild the questions they asked her.
[1:16:27] deathfrombelow7707: I worked over nights for like 6 months and my bank flagged my card everyday for 2 weeks
[1:16:32] LushIsLou: Yeah they get crazy with fraud protection sometime I've literally been paying off a large sum on credit cards before and they'll flag the payment I'm like dude it's from bank to bank are you good
[1:16:55] doc_sharon: I really hope there's not some sort of flag on your credit report katesMadge

[1:17:47] kangg: is this common for small businesses or self employment cuz it’s insane
[1:17:48] HurricaneChapman: Honestly I think they SHOULD ask the elderly this stuff. But it should just be people who need that treatment.. and let's not pretend they don't know. They buy everyone's info wholesale.
[1:17:52] sedgeog: I had a monthly payment for £8 flagged every month - same payer, same amount
[1:17:58] HurricaneChapman: hell they're usually the ones selling it.
[1:18:07] Gobukiller: Somewhat related: I don't use Amazon because they flagged my account for an unusual purchase... it was a gaming PC. Of course it's unusual, I'm not a bitcoin farmer

[1:18:15] Camiigwen: The last financial issue I had was my university failing to refund me an overpayment OSAP made to them. They sent me an eTransfer and then I instantly received another email that they cancelled it. I complained and the manager said “Don’t worry, I’ll follow up with our vendor about the messaging they sent you.” Sure, THAT’S what I care about and not my thousands of dollara

[6:34:49] A_Humble_Wooper: Or if you want to level up your grilled cheese, gouda instead of (or in addition to) cheddar.
[6:34:50] if0rg0t2remember: smoked gouda needs to get in my belly right now
[6:35:01] Count_Nodonora: charcuterie boards in restaurants are sooooo insanely priced. I've never seen one below $30 and that's for a handful of cured meat that would probably cost you $10 if you're unlucky.
[6:35:18] Michalev: @A_Humble_Wooper Gruyere
[6:35:18] Insaif: @A_Humble_Wooper I actually should pick up some gouda for that soon. Been a minute since I had really good grilled cheese. katesHm

[6:38:20] hecktobreakfast: for the interrogation rooms?
[6:38:26] jschaf: The ability to hear through the one-way window
[6:38:39] A_Humble_Wooper: Oh yeah, I remember seeing that video clip!
[6:38:39] jedi_raccoon: one way mirror
[6:38:52] Insaif: Yeah, to have a working speaker system, effectively.
[6:39:17] AshuraX13: He cooks so damn hard. I am always excited when he says, "I cooked" as Nick
[6:39:18] KarnEvil: yeah, made a real one way mirror. said it should work for a recording studio in the future as well.
[6:39:22] Count_Nodonora: He was talking about possibly using the same technique once a record label establishes itself for their recording booth.

[6:40:22] mister_nibbles: redbull smells like peaches?
[6:40:31] AshuraX13: @mister_nibbles The best one does
[6:40:32] Kthanid: the peach ones do.
[6:40:34] jedi_raccoon: 4.0 is 5 years in the future, so the Red Bull is like 8 years old
[6:40:34] Insaif: @mister_nibbles It's specifically Peach Redbull.
[6:40:35] Scriix: ok hear me out, the winter redbull pear cinnamon, is the BEST flavor theyve ever released, its amazing
[6:40:41] laxwall11: The smell check has served us humans for thousands of years

[6:40:55] Nightbot: Follow Kate on Instagram! instagram.com/kate.ttv
[6:41:04] Kthanid: Redbull does NOTHING for me, I could drink 2 and still fall asleep.
[6:41:05] wonderifuwonder: Only one that doesn't taste like battery acid IMO
[6:41:09] A_Humble_Wooper: And google said it should be fine as long as it's been sealed, stored at reasonable temps, and smells/tastes fine.
[6:41:13] AshuraX13: @Kthanid Same
[6:41:13] mister_nibbles: ah got it, regular red bull smells like awful fake bubble gum to me
[6:41:20] kangg: katesSnug BullTime
[6:41:23] hecktobreakfast: Strawberry Apricot is the best flavor
[6:41:26] KarnEvil: peach redbull has nothing in common with regular red bull.
[6:41:28] A_Humble_Wooper: Yeah, it's a permanent flavor now. Was really popular.
[6:41:37] laxwall11: Thanks poo lol
[6:41:53] Michalev: Dragon Fruit is my favorite, though the Craberry was better but it was limited edition
[6:41:58] Pleasantmsp: I dont either
[6:41:59] Michalev: cranberry
[6:42:05] Insaif: I drink a bit of soda each day, but that's it.
[6:42:15] ElectronicChaos: @Michalev Cranberry Redbull was the best back in the day
[6:42:19] Xel562: pooSip
[6:42:27] jedi_raccoon: I stopped drinking energy drinks awhile ago
[6:42:28] Pleasantmsp: oh wait, yeah i drink soda sometimes

[6:42:30] fattydelrey: same i have anxiety caffeine is nono
[6:42:30] mister_nibbles: i might have soda once a week, mostly drinking no sugar iced tea and water
[6:42:38] Gobukiller: it doesn't pop
[6:42:40] kangg: I also don’t drink coffee, I’ll just drink chocolate milk and pop once in a while
[6:42:42] BryceRoyal: Kate got me hooked on that peach Red Bull.

[6:44:29] A_Humble_Wooper: Sweet tea made the traditional southern USA way, is brewed in sugar water not regular water. They add the sugar while the water is hot, to dissolve a larger amount.
[6:44:44] Pleasantmsp: NODDERS
[6:44:51] brainbosh: This is the conversation we had about people that don't have allergies and carbonation.
[6:44:52] AshuraX13: I hiccup whenever I take my first sip of soda. So weird, only ever the first sip
[6:45:02] Insaif: I hope you can get some one-on-one time with Wally at some point like you did with Tom, but this is still good.
[6:45:06] kangg: pop creates burp city lol
[6:45:09] fattydelrey: @A_Humble_Wooper im just saying if you want a kinda nestea at a fast food place in the states you say sweet tea rather than iced tea
[6:45:09] Insaif: You haven't mentioned it yet.
[6:45:17] Gobukiller: Allergic to customers?

[6:53:44] A_Humble_Wooper: Oh yeah, I can't do mushrooms either. I don't mind the flavor, but the texture gives me the icks no matter how they're cooked.

[7:34:29] sreylas: being able to hear outside what is being said in house
[7:34:48] FunkFoo: The amount of scuff Buddha deals with and reports, and what you deal with taking Nikez and Tobii. Scuff King and Queen doing work
[7:34:49] Kthanid: Also need to remember the point of the server isn't to earn money, it's to RP.
[7:34:51] A_Humble_Wooper: The server's only been open a month and a half, too. Still the very early days.
