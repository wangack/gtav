[0:52:49] sny_eu: Yes it does
[0:52:53] dr4c0_27: True
[0:52:58] nintynien: everybody would dump it, but i think the biggest issue is keeping the ATMs, because a lot of cash is in those to keep them active
[0:52:59] kgenera: no utility bill yet

[0:53:20] sny_eu: get it done early and ur setting yourself up good for the future

[0:59:56] Essageo: Does anyone trust dex atm, kek
[1:00:14] redthunder43: I think it's based on how close you are in rep to the lead turf (cypress). Because the company and lang push there 24/7, its hard for any other turf to get rep up
