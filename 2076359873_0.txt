[0:11:12] LietK: was it soul sucking tho

[0:12:33] thyL: @Aledz_ is that about Hassan's "social battery" take? because LOADS of people overblew that
[0:12:56] Aledz_: I believe that is correct, yeah thyL
[0:13:45] BlewUpLP: Hasan streams 6 hours a day, takes weekends off and is complaining
[0:13:46] Aledz_: Its mentally taxing and draining

[0:14:09] netflixankill_: because most people shouldn‚Äôt be sitting in a chair all day lol üòÇ
[0:14:12] ratandcrow: 12 to 16 streams are the streamers choice so can‚Äôt be compared to a normal job
[0:14:25] BigBudB: streamers dont really take actual breaks like you do at work too, like your 2 15mins and 30min lunch
[0:14:27] Aledz_: KEKW
[0:14:27] xAbrielx: and the content that you make, hasan keeps reading the most degenerates of his chatters and then bash them against a wall really violently, insult and degrade them. that takes a toll on your soul, really.rally
[0:14:41] 596950: why dont just split streams at that point tho like 2 6 hrs streama

[2:59:38] Panoramic_Views: 5% is 5% regardless the amount he's just saying 5% of 1000 is more than 5% of 100
[3:00:37] gharend: how is that fair?

[3:09:51] DoctorLAW590: it's ok to have minimums if you also have sufficient incentives for going beyond the minimum
[3:15:02] Hogie48: @Zechss_  ear muffs

[3:16:58] awesomephilip11: o7
[3:17:01] martymagoo78: Oop
[3:17:05] jedimindtricks82k: PepeLaugh
[3:17:20] Panoramic_Views: just like Lang selling mats and it going in his bank account
[3:17:37] JessCee7: 30% isn‚Äôt going to the crew
[3:17:54] martymagoo78: No because this is an illegal activity
[3:18:00] EwLumi: @Panoramic_Views thats not the same lol thats a legit job vs dirty job
[3:18:37] KrisCat: it's different because he's using crew mats for gpus tho
[3:18:39] BobiHouzmeister: if you sell it for straight cash it means you did the whole process so only the crew cut would make sense
[3:18:53] KrisCat: does making moonshine use anything from the crew?
[3:19:37] Hogie48: 75 bucks in that example :p
[3:19:39] genrol: nope
[3:19:46] BobiHouzmeister: no shot
[3:19:50] tannerrobbz: Nahhhh
[3:20:18] martymagoo78: the clean money should go into the house, Harry gets 70% and crew gets 30%
[3:20:20] KrisCat: weed also uses crew money to grow
[3:21:07] jedimindtricks82k: YEP SmokeTime
[3:21:19] cochorus: the issue is if you sell it for a lot less than what you would get if the crew ran it?  maybe?
[3:21:26] KrisCat: that's what they're discussing, so why is lang losing his mind? LUL
[3:21:29] difficultsleep3r: You need clean cash for water bottles.
[3:21:34] Panoramic_Views: thats already being done though half are just doing grime and g6 and sani and they are the richest in the crew
[3:21:46] broxx1: oop
[3:21:51] JMaker24: motherfuckers can keep their money once a certain quota is met
[3:21:52] jedimindtricks82k: @KrisCat classic Lang
[3:22:03] martymagoo78: but you brought in 60k last week, so you‚Äôd be reducing lol
[3:22:30] JMaker24: motherfucker this motherfucker that motherfucker let me borrow a pencil
[3:22:33] tannerrobbz: Tricky situation
[3:22:45] jsketchy01: yeah i agree with that
[3:22:51] Panoramic_Views: Lang finessing the whole crew brings in no dirty money
[3:22:54] JessCee7: It‚Äôs dirty money FailFish
[3:23:13] tannerrobbz: You could just put all your time into Grime
[3:23:20] Hogie48: Lang also just doesnt understand Moonshine fully.   Brown collects his materials to make moonshine, others buy them
[3:23:42] errrrrrL: 25% on mats EZ
[3:23:49] JessCee7: Issue is all the 7k went to brown account
[3:23:55] maybejovi: maybejovi subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[3:24:02] xy02x: speed did air vents, did the hole process him self and still had to give all the money to the crew
[3:24:07] KrisCat: when is arush back? miss that guy.
[3:24:33] JessCee7: It‚Äôs still illegal work
[3:24:37] cochorus: it goes back to the old issue of if someone did their thing in the past but without crew stuff
[3:24:40] errrrrrL: ......
[3:24:45] martymagoo78: crew should 100% get their 30% from moonshine
[3:24:55] SpilledNuts: what if you do an illegal grime run, that is over the weight limit. is that clean or dirty
[3:24:58] cochorus: moonshine illegal
[3:25:02] epohs: simple system feels unsimple

[3:25:44] AnitaBowl: I guess the crew has to start paying for new distillers every week
[3:25:59] ianakaBoogie: harrSip
[3:26:08] tannerrobbz: Lang is literally contriding himself
[3:26:12] QuackstheRubberDuck: @AnitaBowl they weren't before?
[3:26:16] JohnMowgli: But what is the incentive for doing illegal work then?
[3:26:20] goodtimes54: I think it's a good idea for ppl that bring in no dirty to contribute an extra 5 or 10k but I'm a bozo
[3:26:22] tannerrobbz: contradicting
[3:26:27] errrrrrL: So your point stands LUL
[3:26:28] Panoramic_Views: its a good system but the person grinding dirty money work is still making less than someone only doing legal work
[3:26:30] AnitaBowl: No Harry has been paying for his own distillers
[3:26:59] KrisCat: Brown gotta go back and track all the distillers he bought and charge the crew for it then LUL
[3:27:05] jedimindtricks82k: YEP .o O ( i am lost... and high, or both ?)
[3:27:08] FiniteResources: LUL
[3:27:15] Hogie48: @JohnMowgli The incentive is you are in the crew and helping grow it... you dont want to contribute to the crew then why  be in it lol
[3:27:47] JohnMowgli: But that would require everyone to buy in on it
[3:27:56] martymagoo78: it‚Äôs exactly the same as when arush cleaned in his own washers
[3:28:20] Blacklisted_: @martymagoo78 or selling the jewellery to someone for clean cash
[3:28:49] KrisCat: does si still do sani?
[3:29:32] dumpster_diner: nah

[3:29:51] Mr_Durk: Mr_Durk subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 32 months! What kind of day is it?
[3:30:15] me_kNight_: Isn't material money technically dirty money if you don't sell it to a legit business like Mosley
[3:30:49] KrisCat: @me_kNight_ probably not since mats themselves aren't illegal
[3:31:22] tannerrobbz: Lang pockets all his profits from material sales??
[3:31:33] tannerrobbz: Isn‚Äôt that the same thing technically
[3:31:41] Nightbot: Welcome to all you new viewers, if you're enjoying the stream and don't want to miss the next one, please be sure to hit that follow button! Harry will be streaming RP Monday - Friday, come enjoy the content!
[3:32:03] KrisCat: @tannerrobbz if he uses the mats for the crew, he only takes from the crew the amount he made for the mats i think, so no profit.
[3:32:09] SpilledNuts: @tannerrobbz he buys mats with his own money, and sells with his own. He pays his kick ups, and he spends a ton of money for the crew, the crew has been in debt to Lang most of the time.
[3:32:20] Nightbot: PLEASE DO NOT META! Harry can only use information that his character knows in-game. Anything else is meta-gaming and won't be acted upon. If you continuously try to meta you will be timed out, or BANNED.
[3:32:26] shufflestwice: how is no one thinking about how people would get the dirty money for kickups, it would be illegal shit not through the crew lol
[3:32:35] martymagoo78: does he know about the house stuff

[3:33:52] sk8carl: xqcCheer xqcCheer xqcCheer
[3:34:06] turbodyrock: oop
[3:34:32] tannerrobbz: Anyone else still a little confused lol
[3:34:57] odd_frost: @tannerrobbz Yup
[3:35:24] Louwh1sky: i mean if they don't wanna buy in then their out right easy as that
[3:35:24] jedimindtricks82k: peepoHigh .o O ( peepoHigh wandFR3 peepoJuiceFast )
[3:35:25] tannerrobbz: That is a good idea
[3:35:37] Blacklisted_: not wrong
[3:36:05] martymagoo78: but you still need to take your 30% crew cut on top of dirty money
[3:36:19] errrrrrL: like 10hrs of grime?
[3:36:28] epohs: yeah all the intense tracking and different percentages was never simple and will just get harder as the economy grows
[3:36:30] tannerrobbz: @martymagoo78 you would only get a crew cut above the minimum
[3:36:42] KrisCat: making the system as complicated as possible is classic
[3:37:09] IvyOlive: excited for the treasurer meetings should be spicy
[3:37:12] errrrrrL: whats the kickback beyond 30?
[3:37:58] SpilledNuts: Yeah the first 30k I bring in goes to the crew. anything else I get a kick back. My weekly is paid, and i'm paid for any extra work
[3:38:01] tannerrobbz: Yep that‚Äôs a good way to do things
[3:38:04] goodtimes54: All someone has to do is get 2k mats and sell em and their buy in is done shouldn't be too bad
[3:38:16] thumphah: not much benefit or incentive for people to donate 25k weekly when it‚Äôs only the dons to greatly benefit from in it. since most of it goes to CBs for dons jobs
[3:38:29] epohs: I never understood what money was outside the crew, and what had to be tracked
[3:38:45] Panoramic_Views: that makes the kickbacks super complicated though the multistep jobs you cant kickback the cook in weed if the runner dirty money is going all for crew
[3:39:01] goodtimes54: @thumphah they get a group to be apart of and rp with as well
[3:39:07] errrrrrL: its a good test for sure
[3:39:13] me_kNight_: Was that the coin exchange?
[3:39:20] tannerrobbz: @thumphah that money all goes toward crew things. nothing personal like cars, etc
[3:39:40] errrrrrL: still think your clean from moonshine should go toward it tho LUL
[3:39:45] thegavinator3000: Hopefully arush ain't broke when he gets back
[3:39:55] AnitaBowl: on the flip side of that though for the people who aren't on the HQ app and don't have keys to the house why would they give 25-30k when they aren't getting much out of being part of the crew
[3:40:18] OriginalGibsta: is it even possible to push 50k dirty a week to locals in cypress?
[3:40:22] errrrrrL: big picture EZ
[3:40:25] thumphah: @anitabowl my point exactly
[3:40:33] berend1989: just say that they can buy stuff for 50% off, aka 50% gantax sounding nice
[3:40:49] DeadlyCupid93: OMEGALUL
[3:40:53] pattaeto: wicked
[3:40:58] errrrrrL: WICKED nollie
[3:41:17] SpilledNuts: if you want to be a part of a crew you have to sacrifice something. The crew can offer you protection, weed, guns, so on. You may not get something today or immediately but you can be a part of a greater group
[3:41:20] Panoramic_Views: yeah its just a big pyramid scheme by in early get in at the top
[3:41:35] tannerrobbz: You can‚Äôt build and be apart of en empire by yourslef
[3:41:48] goodtimes54: Alot of ppl would rather be apart of the group than go build something on their own
[3:41:50] difficultsleep3r: All stick no carrot.
[3:41:57] KrisCat: These are always the growing pains of early crew formation. A year from now, it'll likely all be worth it.
[3:42:00] tannerrobbz: It takes a collective group of people contributing
[3:42:06] me_kNight_: At the end of the day it's a criminal organisation it won't be fair and we can't do anything about it even if it sucks for smaller guys that don't get anything out of it
[3:42:06] goodtimes54: *with more money
[3:43:05] epohs: it takes a village
[3:43:21] thumphah: I feel like butcoin does have multiple uses. not everyone has to go heists. someone can choose to play a silent hacker with the new hacking stuff
[3:44:18] SpilledNuts: basically no one can have a house, a buttcoin form, a weed farm, and dirty money running all done without a crew. it's not possible, you have to buy into something
[3:45:26] errrrrrL: exactly, especially if you bringing in excess dirty
[3:45:51] Stuckness: i think its partly because the pipelines were needed for weed due to lots of people needing to do different jobs... moonshine is just different
[3:46:17] difficultsleep3r: Dirty should stay dirty. Introducing clean just complicated the kick back calculations.
[3:46:47] Avayden: I don't think it's a harry problem i think it's a people have a problem with the way harry feels about money
[3:48:04] goodtimes54: Forget doing anything in the crim world, just owning a house and a car is tough without a crew
[3:48:16] SpilledNuts: true
[3:48:50] me_kNight_: I think viewers don't care about the main crew but it leaves a sour taste in your mouth when the small guys just grind and pay the crew for nothing. I don't care but understand why people get hung up on the whole ordeal
[3:49:34] goodtimes54: Ppl don't like change huh
[3:53:56] me_kNight_: Changing subject anyone planning to watch dune part two or will you wait for it to drop on Disney+ or whatever?
[3:53:59] AshOfAllGames: I mean - some (like Marty) have also been denied guns and access to other things already
[3:54:08] broxx1: TeaTime
[3:54:16] AshOfAllGames: So I dunno if he'll be willing to pay as much as the main 5
[3:54:24] goodtimes54: @me_knight_ I can understand why some ppl would feel that way, but the small guys are choosing to do that. Whether it's in hopes to move up the ladder or maybe be apart of a c team. my pov is you should pity someone or wag your finger at someone successful cause they have interns that want to work for em
[3:54:39] goodtimes54: *shouldnt
[3:54:48] AshOfAllGames: But the problem is that might not want to work for them
[3:54:52] AshOfAllGames: They might go somewhere else
[3:55:04] AshOfAllGames: But it seems like everyone thinks the little guys have no choices or options
[3:55:15] Xernique: as long as money goes towards something good for everyone its good. buying a house for the dons with crew money though? thats not gonna end well
[3:55:26] SpilledNuts: octo's a nice looking young man
[3:55:27] broxx1: @AshOfAllGames we all know why marty was denied a gun
[3:55:29] Xernique: the house should be financed privately
[3:55:31] AshOfAllGames: Especially if they won't have access
[3:55:45] Xernique: for sure, thats a big problem
[3:55:47] shiifon: got any spare table for this 1on1? LUL
[3:55:52] AshOfAllGames: @broxx1 Still wouldn't pay 25k to have access to things I won't really have access to
[3:56:14] AshOfAllGames: Pay me and have this stuff
[3:56:20] AshOfAllGames: But only have it when I say you can
[3:56:22] OriginalGibsta: who asked?
[3:56:33] its_ajc: did I miss the don meeting chat
[3:56:51] SpilledNuts: @its_ajc sorta, there was one with gigi
[3:56:52] Xernique: @its_ajc just a financial meeting with gigi

[3:57:58] mogambo_khushhua: tony running money is just an instant loss of 5k a time

[3:58:59] EyeScraem: @me_kNight_ other ppl deal with scuff to tho they just power through it and tony cant
[3:59:28] me_kNight_: @eyescraem true

[6:07:50] Mhysamari: Marty just needs Langs approval, and he'll never get it sadge
[6:07:52] w1ldrabb1tTV: Lang could give Martin advice,. coaching and mentoring. Not just get involved financial
[6:08:13] mrdumpling420: Lang needs to admit he was turned off by the JP issue.  Wish those 2 would resolve their issues... Lang should be excited to bring Marty on jobs..

[6:32:57] haywood_jahbloume: i watch every day and still don't understand the problem lol
[6:32:57] dr_sly_one: Lang doesn't want a repeat of 3.0 hurt feelings with people wanting him to be their dad
[6:32:58] FiniteResources: problems on top of problems
[6:33:00] KcsBack: real lol
[6:33:03] artguychris: marty is so paranoid
[6:33:05] mrdumpling420: Lang didn't open up at all lol I was really hoping for that.  He has been stand off ish towards Martin... you haceng

[6:33:17] artguychris: the problem is that he was raised by JP
[6:33:17] Themessias1001: Lang was not receptive to anything
[6:33:18] RoronoaZoro: I feel like what marty wants from a group just isn‚Äôt what your group provides
[6:33:19] mrdumpling420: It was great Harry
[6:33:19] CaptnCrafty: Lang just has a resting bitch voice/tone and Martin takes it personal
[6:33:20] kingomer_1522: yes
[6:33:21] Panoramic_Views: and Lang wont tell him he has an issue when he clearly does
[6:33:22] Yusuke429: Marty wants lang to like him. Lang doesn't like Marty and never will.  Until they both are honest about that it will never work.
[6:33:22] 596950: i mean he when through alot to be paranoid
[6:33:22] ChiefinIt: he's like avoiding the crew because he has an issue with lang
[6:33:22] KrisCat: This was just peak marty and peak lang inevitably butting heads, and it spreads out to the rest of the crew.
[6:33:25] jotello10: Martin day 1 was getting such positive vibes from everyone
[6:33:27] JoeKsova: tbf from his pov it looked that way
[6:33:28] AdrianShoey: 3.0 drama coming back into 4.0
[6:33:29] TyrantFPS: he projected his issue with lang onto everyone else
[6:33:30] Czechstasy: I don't think it wont ever not be a character trait of Marty's to not want daddy Lang approval
[6:33:33] oneanimated: harry has always had his doubts but there he is he knows his place as a don the mistake was harry venting to marty and now marty feels hes at the dons level of respect
[6:33:35] will_nc1: he made it seem like a crew issue but it‚Äôs all a Lang  issue
[6:33:35] AntzRede: Lang doesn't care about feelings
[6:33:38] z_e_p_h_i_r: yeah. it's like with parents. the kid will treat them as a monolith, even if their problem is just with one of them
[6:33:42] mang9698: KEKW
[6:33:42] w1ldrabb1tTV: @captncrafty truuuue
[6:33:43] artguychris: yeah, that really sucks

[6:33:55] ridarizam: how could yuno do this
[6:33:55] JoeKsova: Harry and Marty were tight but things got awkward for a couple weeks
[6:33:56] CozyxVibes: very true
[6:33:57] AntzRede: Called out a don like it was nothing
[6:33:58] Rychus4: $500 Aware
[6:33:58] limesacul: brown aint no leader in his eyes :(
[6:34:02] weaseljuice84: he needs to be gone.... i don't think this will be the last either
[6:34:03] 11_Brad_11: feel like he cooked too much lol
[6:34:03] thedonmegatv: lands an asshole but he‚Äôs an asshole to everyone lol

[6:34:18] jotello10: geez
[6:34:18] deadpaint_tm: does Harry the character believe that the other dons never defer to Lang?
[6:34:18] bdesmet26: @aledz_ ü§£
[6:34:20] artguychris: LMAO
[6:34:25] mrdumpling420: Bro nobody was selling lol I could see it every day
[6:34:27] fakecontrol51: lang should've told him that he got problem with him working with jp
[6:34:28] mel0yelo: sad how hard turd stuff fell off
[6:34:29] toledzzz: lang treats Marty like an annoying kid brother most times but marty is super paranoid for sure
[6:34:31] bonewp: @Yusuke429 this is not true at all . IF lang didnt like marti he would even been able to be in the group. Langs personality is cold with everybody.
[6:34:33] The_Orange_Flash: Martin just wants Lang to ask him to say "DADA"
[6:34:36] artguychris: i think he wanted a hug goodbye LUL
[6:34:40] jackwheel10: where's dougie been
[6:34:40] MarginallyNoted: Lang coplains about Marty everyday though‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm so confused!ü§™
[6:34:41] wacko_302em: he got an issue with lang but in hes mind he thinks lang is the group in a whole witch is not the case i taking it ...
[6:34:44] mrdumpling420: I saw the weed deteriorating
[6:34:46] Tamzim: He defo over thinking stuff
[6:34:50] Fugeki: its just how things align from different perspectives people have different views I guess sad but it is what it is
[6:34:53] AntzRede: The vu situation was so blown out of proportion just 500 bucks
[6:34:53] xy02x: u just said Harry now has a problem with Marty now, so are u gonna tell Marty u have a problem with him now ?
[6:34:54] carbonraider99: could it have been perceived that way?
[6:34:55] Hikuuu: @harry sorry I meant in Marty's POV it seems that way? or idk
[6:34:59] themonstaking: Marty wants to be treated kindly but this crew doesn't do that
[6:35:05] oneanimated: harry has always been that guy that switches things thats how he keeps his sanity
[6:35:07] JoeKsova: from Marty‚Äôs perspective Harry and Marty used to hunt and chill together but that stopped
[6:35:11] epohs: It 100% is just a problem between Lang & Marty. I get what Marty‚Äôs saying, but it‚Äôs a lost cause.
[6:35:11] qvbxx: how did he know about the Don House?
[6:35:18] RoronoaZoro: @themonstaking yeah seems like what Marty wants just doesn‚Äôt fit the crew
[6:35:22] mrdumpling420: Do you eat rats down here lol
[6:35:23] bonewp: @MarginallyNoted he complains with the don for actions but that doest mean he dislike him or dont want him around
[6:35:24] Joshua7948: he knows Lang doesn't like him, thinks he lets that cloud his judgement with everyone else
[6:35:30] PrivateSyaz: Martin is an overthinker but Lang has been kind of cold to him after the JP thing. But thats understandable since Lang felt Marty pawned it off on him
[6:35:30] bigxfisch: i thought marty was gonna start moonshining
[6:35:31] limesacul: Marty is a huge overthinker
[6:35:32] KrisCat: @bonewp lang can be pretty cold, but he def has had a prob w/ marty after that whole jp/cg debacle. he said he doesn't trust him anymore.
[6:35:35] artguychris: @themonstaking it was kinda getting there with lang but lang soured hard when the JP situation blew up
[6:35:35] Tamzim: You been solo alot last few weeks
[6:35:39] epohs: @joshua7948 100%
[6:35:46] jayruff65: your more with marlo than anyone
[6:35:47] Fugeki: that kind of got cleared up though
[6:35:48] sajenth: lang is way ruder to marty than anyone else tbf - but other than that just drama
[6:35:49] oneanimated: lang just gives no fs. luci is more monotone
[6:35:50] ajdoublea: Marty is in a vunerable place
[6:35:52] z_e_p_h_i_r: marty made that jp situation and then dipped, froced drama rp. I think that's the thing that lang is still annoyed about.
[6:35:58] mrdumpling420: Martin and Lang need to bond with each other lol go rob some people lol
[6:35:58] ericasamerica: sadge
[6:35:59] tsotitos: I think Marty just wants respect as a contributing member of the group
[6:35:59] obscurewill: Marty sees Lang as the leader, so his problems with Lang are problems with the crew to him
[6:36:00] fenixblac: Martin doesn‚Äôt realize that Harry is the Ultimate Fulcrum‚Ä¶. He will absolutely pivot to what he finds interesting
[6:36:00] armeldk89: no he said you two and gg so you 2 as the 2 dons and gg
[6:36:00] OTG_Bushwacker: he used to friendship with x and he wants someone to hang out with him all day
[6:36:00] dr_sly_one: Marty has always off loaded his insecurities onto others
[6:36:01] z_e_p_h_i_r: And if Marty had had his gun when CG got him, they still woulda got him
[6:36:04] jotello10: Does this mean Harry is going to shave his beard?
[6:36:06] Jayco: the major disconnect is everyone is out doing their own things cause there‚Äôs too many people from the start. things aren‚Äôt worked on together as a team it‚Äôs just individuals putting together a big pot
[6:36:09] itskevwin: well he did clear up the issue with you & how he misread the situation
[6:36:12] eazypzz: I‚Äôm just sus now
[6:36:16] artguychris: put marty on the DAP system and give him a 7 day suspension
[6:36:18] sharnehorse390: he was just expressing his feelings. should he be punished for that?
[6:36:19] artguychris: lmao
[6:36:24] TossTheBomb: Sadge
[6:36:24] KrisCat: @z_e_p_h_i_r they would've gotten him AND his gun LUL
[6:36:26] dr_sly_one: buddhaWiggle
[6:36:28] deadpaint_tm: his perspective of the don structure has some merit it seems
[6:36:33] CocaColaAddicted: maybe he didn't understand how this group work, he thought this is like any other gang , hanging 24/7 together !
[6:36:34] mel0yelo: luci was right marty really took the gun situation as a fuck you
[6:36:38] Laffing_Man: at least the issues are being talked about
[6:36:41] FiniteResources: @sharnehorse390 especially when they asked for his feelings lol
[6:36:47] Retrovisionsllc: but you cant deny the tone lang has with marty compared to everyone else
[6:36:48] codyg54: that was great rp from all
[6:36:48] AnitaBowl: @Jayco This is it exactly... they don't even seem like friends anymore... just people sharing an umbrella
[6:36:48] ktothec99: Martin getting put on a PIP
[6:36:48] AntzRede: I feel like the second heist crew was a terrible decision for Marty in relation to the crew
[6:36:54] CozyxVibes: hes use to a close knit group
[6:36:58] AntzRede: Created distance and drama
[6:37:00] artguychris: all of this makes great sense, the dons have reason to cut him now or give him the chance to not fuck up after this convo
[6:37:00] 2emedy: Perfect examples are Teddy and Harry. They do their own shit and bring in the money. No complaints.
[6:37:08] errrrrrL: thats the difference between most of yall and him
[6:37:08] ulti_feeeeeeeed: now u know who created drama in the company
[6:37:09] eazypzz: it‚Äôs not going anywhere lol
[6:37:10] its_ajc: I think marty thinks the crew is run differently
[6:37:11] abes365: i think with his idea of starting his own crew he accidentally isolated himself and with the distance made he started seeing things in a different perspective as if he was an outsider
[6:37:19] ahealthykidd: I think Marty‚Äôs only problem is lang tbh
[6:37:19] limesacul: thats what lang said
[6:37:20] salmonroe17: YOU'RE BANG ON
[6:37:22] Jayco: exactly but other people don‚Äôt get to see the inside like the dons do. they‚Äôre just left to think for a week between meetings
[6:37:22] tedium7: eatt such interesting group dynamics
[6:37:23] The_Orange_Flash: ok yeah i think youre right
[6:37:23] KrisCat: @CocaColaAddicted nah, he def understood before he joined that everyone kinda worked independently.
[6:37:24] nightstarstolen: Marty ran a gang right? He has as much assets as the rest of the crew combined. So just make him a Don
[6:37:24] bird24287: Marty probably would have liked an invite for sure
[6:37:24] RoronoaZoro: @antzrede I don‚Äôt think this crew would‚Äôve ever fit what he expects from a crew which is why he made a second one as like a buffer
[6:37:29] The_Orange_Flash: NODDERS
[6:37:31] TossTheBomb: YEP
[6:37:31] carbonraider99: he‚Äôs used to being in a family typa gang
[6:37:32] potatowarrior411: thats the feel i get too
[6:37:33] cabrito_32: cabrito_32 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[6:37:33] w1ldrabb1tTV: This group is great for independent leaders
[6:37:34] 596950: martys view of the group is how other groups work
[6:37:37] JK1dd: thats it
[6:37:40] rob6002: Yep
[6:37:41] pujazia: hes not priority
[6:37:42] Jayco: YUP
[6:37:43] Retrovisionsllc: but you cant deny the tone lang has with marty compared to everyone else
[6:37:44] ccompres: good point
[6:37:45] ktothec99: He is used to having more agency over the crew
[6:37:47] GreasySlothKing: tru
[6:37:48] PrivateSyaz: He wants to feel like hes part of the group more than he is
[6:37:50] nightstarstolen: He has as  many assets as the rest of the crew combined. So why not brin him in as Don
[6:37:50] salmonroe17: agreed, the structure he wants is not the structure he agreed to
[6:37:50] w1ldrabb1tTV: Nailed it
[6:37:51] sajenth: marty does do more than a lot of dons in terms of BUT and money but he wasn't there at the start
[6:37:53] ILeoP: but let‚Äôs be real you and Buddha have said you don‚Äôt trust him after Jp situation, why not just tell him lol
[6:37:54] sharnehorse390: that's true
[6:37:55] martymagoo78: issue all stemmed from Marty wants to be invovled‚Ä¶ but he took himself away from that by creating a side crew with JP and that caused drama‚Ä¶
[6:37:56] FiniteResources: that and nobody would like being spoken to by lang like that
[6:37:56] Tamzim: Yeah you right he want to be a don
[6:37:57] MrBoOoOoOoOoOoM: and if he wants to be involved he just has to speak up
[6:38:00] carbonraider99: yea ur right
[6:38:02] RoronoaZoro: @kriscat I think he made the second heist crew to cover like what he would miss from his old gang to this new crew
[6:38:08] eazypzz: I‚Äôm hella sus now
[6:38:08] PluckyBench: I Dont think he wants Don but wants to be higher then a grunt per day.
[6:38:12] mendog1: @Retrovisionsllc Lang been shiting on Octo and look at him now :D
[6:38:12] EyeScraem: YEP
[6:38:17] EyeScraem: without actually talking to coto
[6:38:19] EyeScraem: octo*
[6:38:20] Fugeki: He knew GIGACHAD  octo is him
[6:38:24] Jayco: exactly my thought too
[6:38:26] spolito12: I mean its very easy to see why he thinks Lang is disrespectful. Langs character is just harsh with everyone
[6:38:26] bird24287: Trueeee same scenerio
[6:38:28] mr_booosh: I think lang is scared Marty will make others see langs gaslighting so is extra cold to him
[6:38:30] fenixblac: But that‚Äôs on him‚Ä¶ He can make a smaller crew and have exactly that feeling
[6:38:32] PluckyBench: true
[6:38:34] deadpaint_tm: the emerging Marty/Yuno duo has great promise now
[6:38:35] saliromeo: Octo stepped up and proved his worth
[6:38:35] jayruff65: I think he said that when he said he feels like the companies intern
[6:38:37] dirtywhitet: granted I think octo deserves tonys seat as a rolemodel for the group
[6:38:39] LookAtThisTeam: What it comes down to is that Martin can't fully articulate his problem with Lang. Whereas Lang refuses to admit he has a problem with Martin.
[6:38:39] salmonroe17: honestly sounds like he wants both The Company and Oldbois strucutre at the same time
[6:38:43] Yusuke429: Lang does not trust him.
[6:38:46] oneanimated: octo acts like a don by actions but will not get upset that he doesnt have the title
[6:38:50] artguychris: Harry stuck up for Martin
[6:38:56] wadiyatalkinabeetm8: Honestly all just stems from Lang being seen as the leader and that Lang was cold to him all the time
[6:38:58] veqzei: would be good if lang just said it how it is
[6:39:00] 559axis: Marty reminds me of Curtis from 2.0.
[6:39:07] 596950: Lang def dont trust him tho so he lied
[6:39:09] Yusuke429: Lang and Marty never left the VU.
[6:39:09] ILeoP: yea my bad was more Buddha @harry
[6:39:12] FiniteResources: LUL
[6:39:15] martymagoo78: Marty wants a ‚Äòfamily‚Äô and looks to Lang to deliver that‚Ä¶. and he never will. its a crew
[6:39:16] mrdumpling420: Octo is acting like a Don lol @harry let's be real.  I love Martin 2 lol but he's a different vibe. Guy created a casino in his house.  That's insane
[6:39:18] artguychris: Martin probably realizes that he's on Yuno and Octo's level but he wants their treatment, problem is that he fucked up big with the JP situation
[6:39:19] bigxfisch: lang just speaks blunt and direct
[6:39:21] Laffing_Man: it wont ever get solved because they never find a compromised
[6:39:23] Fugeki: oh god dont compare curtis and marty not even close
[6:39:25] saliromeo: Lang will never be upfront with Martin
[6:39:27] The_Orange_Flash: Lang took X and Harry from Martin in his eyes KEKW
[6:39:30] mel0yelo: CB COMMS LUL
[6:39:31] mr_booosh: lang is scared of Martys smarts
[6:39:33] w1ldrabb1tTV: Because Lang doesn't straight up say what he really thinks about Marty. Instead he just spams questions.
[6:39:36] quote_me_if_horsen: VU? what is that, that place does not exist
[6:39:41] OmegamonX: @oneanimated octo is the type to leave the crew if he had to be a don
[6:39:47] its_ajc: and you paid up for it, that was resolved
[6:39:54] KrisCat: Marty and JP are both drama magnets LUL
[6:39:55] oneanimated: true
[6:39:59] PrivateSyaz: Martin probably feels like everyone is on Langs side and hes seperate though. He kept mentioning he thinks of everyone as a group and he fels left out
[6:39:59] BurdenOrAGift: it was like a family argument to be honest
[6:40:05] ILeoP: but idk why he doesn‚Äôt just leave lmao, I feel both parties would be better of
[6:40:06] EyeScraem: @OmegamonX yea I wouldn't speak for the character but its pretty clear he doesn't want to be a don
[6:40:06] artguychris: Casino would be so sick with this group
[6:40:09] joshbankai: I think all Brown said that wasn't positive about Marty was with JP, and he was right about it
[6:40:11] JK1dd: lang aint being straight
[6:40:13] artguychris: Would be a shame if this all blows up
[6:40:16] TossTheBomb: Tryin to throw under the bus type deflecting
[6:40:17] Kalciferzz: seem like marty having issue with lang and he feel lang influence the group when instead lang is just 1 of the dons
[6:40:19] mistinni: I like how yall had marty but still had more people to see but yall forgot harry
[6:40:19] Scorpio_o7: Lang tends to be cold to everyone, not just marty. If a family is what he wants from lang he is barking up the wrong tree
[6:40:20] aananas00: another drama no speedy
[6:40:24] AdrianShoey: He is trying to be Martin and all Lang can see is Marty.
[6:40:24] Panoramic_Views: Lang has to be willing to admin he has a problem he is pretending like he doesnt to his face
[6:40:25] salmonroe17: would Harry Brown ever want to call Martin about starting up the Casino again?
[6:40:33] KrisCat: Marty prob also misses JP
[6:40:34] BaldScooter: lang will just act like the problem doesn‚Äôt exist and I don‚Äôt think Martin is that way
[6:40:34] spolito12: Lang just has a harsh tone and doesnt play into emotions
[6:40:35] saliromeo: I honestly think Martin joined thinking JP would join after him‚Ä¶
[6:40:40] rubadubdubb_: marty prob did want that hug
[6:40:42] jesscdcc: i like what sykkuno said, i think he wants lang to treat him as a friend and not just part of the group.
[6:40:43] artguychris: @AdrianShoey then dont bring in JP when Lang advises not to
[6:40:50] saliromeo: and then the war happened the same day
[6:40:52] martymagoo78: yeah, Marry feels lost without JP
[6:40:53] jayruff65: Marty wants that Yuno treatment from lang
[6:41:03] Wrliie: harrRat harrRat harrRat harrRat harrRat
[6:41:04] RoronoaZoro: @kriscat he 100% misses having Jp and people to hang out with and do stuff constantly
[6:41:05] xItzSmoke: i think Martin wants to be best friends with lang irl and just isn‚Äôt role playing lo√±
[6:41:05] Czechstasy: Lol
[6:41:09] mrdumpling420: That happened all in the same night didn't it
[6:41:16] pocketmoose_: sort of seems like he didn't understand that it's ok if not every one respects or likes each other
[6:41:25] deadpaint_tm: IRL those who go on and on about being straight shooters are rarely that
[6:41:25] its_ajc: marty knows none of that too, he doesnt realize what you had to pay up
[6:41:28] ridarizam: arush died for this group and yall are arguing
[6:41:35] The_Orange_Flash: @w1ldrabb1tTV do you feel lang needs to tell his true feelings about Marty? What happens then?
[6:41:38] Fugeki: The Arush incident Aware
[6:41:42] definetlynot_tfue: @jayruff65 yeah seems like it as he just lost JP
[6:41:42] saliromeo: Arush is the glue
[6:41:47] SekretAznMan: LULW
[6:41:47] oneanimated: marty just needs to accept his place in the crew he himself said he didnt want to be a leader anymore hense why he left the company
[6:41:47] Arrepios: Lang reminds me of Alex Fergunson, he was harsh with CR7 which made him grow, but the same method made Nani lose his mind LUL
[6:41:48] EyeScraem: oop
[6:41:52] artguychris: LMAO

[6:42:02] Wrliie: lmao
[6:42:03] SekretAznMan: VU lady misses you harry please visit her Pepehands
[6:42:03] mrdumpling420: @harry I was there for most of that night with Msrtin.  The whole night you were explaining the whole break down clearly of how the system worked lol
[6:42:04] AdrianShoey: @artguychris No disagreement, I wouldn't trust JP to open an umbrella.
[6:42:04] sm0k3ngun: the problem is that is role play and everything thinks it‚Äôs real life. communication is lacking for a reason because it creates content. lang won‚Äôt tell Marty what he did wrong and Marty won‚Äôt ask lang because it‚Äôs role play and that‚Äôs what creates content.
[6:42:06] 596950: If lang does at some point tell marty his true feelings then hes leaving for sure
[6:42:08] belsthegreat: That broke me
[6:42:10] TossTheBomb: 2 week spiral avoided
[6:42:14] artguychris: @AdrianShoey lul
[6:42:16] EyeScraem: its a convo that needed to happen
[6:42:16] its_ajc: it was better today than another day too
[6:42:31] Fugeki: Also without saying chat its RP so we chilling it was great
[6:42:34] wadiyatalkinabeetm8: LUL
[6:42:36] Wrliie: @EyeScraem what kinda convo was it?
[6:42:37] westcoastchris_: that convo was a W rp scene tho
[6:42:38] oneanimated: great rp tho really enjoying this
[6:42:41] jryan701: honestly healthy conversation regardless of the tone
[6:42:42] KcsBack: that sit down went from 0 to 100 quick KEKW had everyone speechless
[6:42:45] OTG_Bushwacker: he does twist want happens a little bit to suit his narrative.
[6:42:59] saliromeo: Martin came in hot
[6:43:01] mrdumpling420: Hahahha bro you were eating lol
[6:43:02] mr_booosh: I know its role play but does anyone get scared how well Buddha can role play manipulation
[6:43:07] NoTaGain15151: @OTG_Bushwacker everybody does that
[6:43:11] EyeScraem: @Wrliie ppl spoke their feelings marty was holding back and lang sort of saying how he feels
[6:43:11] KrisCat: oh for sure
[6:43:17] qvbxx: Yup
[6:43:20] deadpaint_tm: it‚Äôs a city of sociopaths for great entertainment
[6:43:28] TeflonJeff1: weird question but are these real life issues or just in game issues ü§£ü§£
[6:43:32] joshbankai: I miss Marty looking like Edna SadgeCry
[6:43:32] Yusuke429: He gave jp the key to his house.
[6:43:37] artguychris: 100 percent
[6:43:40] Viper0922: does harry not see marty side at all?
[6:43:41] KrisCat: @TeflonJeff1 it's rp
[6:43:42] The_Orange_Flash: Martin needs to get his crew stars up
[6:43:47] oneanimated: harry stunlocked marty by constantly calling him out . loved it
[6:43:48] Shieldsy1: the only reason the crew got draggd in was because he gave you the usbs
[6:43:52] zdrago666: or sounds like he did it so JP didn't first
[6:43:54] its_ajc: and then pawned it all off to Lang to handle KEKW
[6:43:59] bigchimpo: the tone of Yuno's audit definitely got my guards down
[6:44:02] Viper0922: @TeflonJeff1 its gta RP
[6:44:02] spolito12: female: Lang  tone is always harsh and doesnt play into emotions. I get feeling the disrespect but should know lang by now
[6:44:04] BaldScooter: he just wants to be treated like a friend
[6:44:04] bunny2052: do you no longer take damage in the sewers
[6:44:04] TeflonJeff1: it‚Äôs great RP @kriscat   very believable haha
[6:44:06] mrdumpling420: I'm so glad he shot him lol it put him in his place hahaha
[6:44:07] Wrliie: @EyeScraem ooh thank you
[6:44:08] postAmongUsist: he also wanted no part of the first jp conflict, only to then start his own jp conflict a week after KEKW
[6:44:10] wardenau: @TeflonJeff1 brother. if you think these are irl issues, you need to take a step back
[6:44:17] barer666: And lang even agreed that Marty shooting Jp was the right thing to do
[6:44:18] fenixblac: Hell the first person I ever saw shoot JP was Tony back in 3.0, lol
[6:44:21] Nywro: If Marty takes one thing from that meeting, call Octo about running money duo. LUL
[6:44:25] NoTaGain15151: i think he wasn't trying to do that , he was trying to explain how he felt
[6:44:29] KcsBack: @bigchimpo haha facts octo teddy and yunos was all chill then marty came and chaos LUL
[6:44:29] james_09_24_: he even tried to run from the conflict and let buddha handle it right
[6:44:34] artguychris: the fact that Lang gave Marty the room to bring in JP in his group seems like a huge sign of respect
[6:44:34] saliromeo: you guys should hand over Martin to Teddy foheadSTARE
[6:44:35] ILeoP: that whole pawned of to lang was not what happened lmao these guys just communicate horribly
[6:44:41] Fugeki: @Harry Maybe also have a call with him about it
[6:44:49] LietK: he wanted a ride or die crew it seems, or his guns back i guess
[6:44:54] TeflonJeff1: @wardenau I was joking by the way‚Äùü§£ü§£‚Äù just was great and believed. it‚Äôs okay. relax
[6:44:57] zdrago666: do you think we should have taken his key?
[6:45:18] spolito12: female: Harry
[6:45:22] Wrliie: @james_09_24_ true
[6:45:24] mrdumpling420: No taking his key is basically like saying good bye lol
[6:45:29] saliromeo: @zdrago666 idk why they aren‚Äôt paranoid about that LUL
[6:45:29] 596950: the type of group that marty views is a gang type group yes
[6:45:30] katerade38: 100%
[6:45:30] OccasionalTryHard: @Harry I've always wondered, is Brown based on that UK movie with the character named Harry Brown??
[6:45:33] KrisCat: @ILeoP mmm, it's kinda what happened
[6:45:35] turbodyrock: @zdrago666 "we" arent doing anything
[6:45:38] KcsBack: very truuu
[6:45:42] SkyHawk0404: Yeah
[6:45:46] nahoopii: He can still be a leader
[6:45:48] Viper0922: nahhh
[6:45:49] odd_frost: I don't see that but that's definitely possible
[6:45:51] errrrrrL: #martin4don
[6:45:51] mr_booosh: Lang is for sure threatened by that though
[6:45:52] Messagge: he doesnt want to be a leader anymore
[6:45:53] 596950: Actually he said the oppsite but idk
[6:45:54] BaldScooter: I think Omie has said he didn‚Äôt wanna be a leader at all
[6:45:54] lltundell: He wants to be a DON
[6:45:54] jayruff65: good point Harry I agree
[6:45:57] woolsCW: true, but he can still run his own crew like Teddy, but that is different
[6:46:04] BaldScooter: but the character might act very differently
[6:46:04] SkyHawk0404: @mr_booosh I don't think Lang cares
[6:46:05] 11_Brad_11: He thinks he's a level between don and pusher
[6:46:07] artguychris: marty needs to learn that he's supposed to operate like yuno
[6:46:09] LietK: he can captain his own crew like teddy
[6:46:09] goodtimes54: What makes you feel that way? I'm just curious idc either eay
[6:46:10] sm0k3ngun: Marty and lang will never fully communicate because it creates great content. the same way JP and lang don‚Äôt fully communicate. the reason why it will never work because lang doesn‚Äôt tell Marty 100% his problem and Marty never tells lang what he really wants either.
[6:46:10] OrangesArePurple: He definitely wants a seat at the table
[6:46:11] KcsBack: he's definitely adjusting no doubt about it
[6:46:12] Praxism: yeah not seeing that
[6:46:12] EyeScraem: he might not want to be but he 100% is, its very rare for someone to challenge him
[6:46:17] RoronoaZoro: @baldscooter he‚Äôs said a lot of things that haven‚Äôt exactly been showcased in rp LUL
[6:46:17] saliromeo: @mr_booosh u don‚Äôt know lang then LUL LUL
[6:46:22] Viper0922: you dont see marty and lang interactions tho
[6:46:27] eddieb0822: does seem like he craves validation though
[6:46:29] LookAtThisTeam: depends by what he meant by respect
[6:46:34] KrisCat: @11_Brad_11 he was kinda treated that way in the beginning tho, inadvertantly.
[6:46:46] EyeScraem: marty could have his own side crew tbh
[6:46:48] mr_booosh: lang is the most manipulative character on the server I wouldn't be so sure
[6:46:50] barer666: If it was a nobody, he would have been ocean dumped already
[6:46:50] deadpaint_tm: his character is very talented
[6:46:51] dootadoo: He was leading something and it fell apart after JP came back to him. Marty is like were is Larry?
[6:46:51] katerade38: he has a key before illya too
[6:46:52] KrisCat: *inadvertently
[6:46:52] eazypzz: 100%
[6:46:54] Messagge: yea he wants more
[6:46:54] joshbankai: Brown should just adopt Marty... a rich kid for once Kappa
[6:46:55] Czechstasy: its a pretty good oppurtunity
[6:46:59] BaldScooter: he does want validation and friendliness
[6:46:59] finsane1: i get when he ask for advice only on the casino and was totally shut down
[6:47:07] obscurewill: Martin is confusing because he wants access to crew resources as "our resources" but his butcoin and stuff is "his butcoin" and continues to juice his farm and not the crew's after weeks of meetings about juicing the butcoin
[6:47:09] zosogod87: Underutilized
[6:47:10] zdrago666: harrNODDERS harrNODDERS harrNODDERS
[6:47:16] tsteaky: seems like he needs validation that jp gave
[6:47:16] loadingl_: feels isolated?
[6:47:20] goodtimes54: Only reason I don't think he cares about the hierarchy is because he wants to mix everything he's worked for
[6:47:22] TossTheBomb: harrNODDERS double dipping harrNODDERS
[6:47:24] RoronoaZoro: I mean he is used to having a gang and people by him at all times and now the crew he‚Äôs apart of isn‚Äôt really that
[6:47:25] Arrepios: @LookAtThisTeam someone said Luciano was speaking to Marty, Lang was interrogating him, I think that's the "respect" thing he means
[6:47:26] Notta_Tryhard: because it's crew of everyone else to him
[6:47:27] rubadubdubb_: he prob wants sympathy from lang but lang just doesn't give that
[6:47:29] 596950: wants validation and that you did a good job which goes exactly what buddha wants
[6:47:29] NoTaGain15151: hes used to very close gang banger gangs
[6:47:32] jayruff65: I wonder how Larry feels?
[6:47:35] SEINA6: it all fell apart when oscar left
[6:47:42] JMaker24: what‚Äôs he really getting out of being with the crew tho
[6:47:44] Praxism: support and camaraderie. it‚Äôs that simple
[6:47:47] jambag00: jambag00 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 26 months! 
[6:47:48] CozyxVibes: self sufficient
[6:47:54] TossTheBomb: Start a whole gig
[6:47:54] joshbankai: Brown's heist crew PogU
[6:47:56] ChiefinIt: Harry builds empires
[6:47:56] SkyHawk0404: People get hung up on one thing and just keep parroting stuff
[6:47:59] difficultsleep3r: Lang has been icing him out. He knows Lang wants his key.
[6:47:59] OccasionalTryHard: They don't know Harry like we do, they are casuals bro dont sweat those dweebs throwing shade
[6:48:00] Nywro: R&D Don
[6:48:04] PteradactylJones: Harry the Don of the Shine
[6:48:05] Viper0922: he wants lang to be good friends like casion heist type friendship
[6:48:23] oneanimated: thats why yuno is respected he doesnt complain and everything he does is to juice the crew up woth his own earnings
[6:48:24] joshbankai: the notebook incident
[6:48:29] tsteaky: good point to be able to bring up
[6:48:33] jambag00: Harry came to the sewers to de-stress and got more stressed
[6:48:33] salmonroe17: i like this structure vs other crews
[6:48:34] LEXDER_07: isent tat wat marty is trying to do wit the casino ??
[6:48:44] goodtimes54: If Marty was upset about the hierarchy I don't think he'd offer to throw in his farm and assets but what do I know
[6:48:52] CozyxVibes: once marty has the casino i think he will find himself in a better position
[6:48:55] 596950: What i got from that is that marty wants buddha validation but its not getting it and prob never will
[6:49:02] OccasionalTryHard: Some 3.0 chatters havent been fully introduced to the 4.0 Warry, that's how I see it
[6:49:06] Hengarath: @goodtimes54 but maybe he is trying to show that he wants to be one of the dons
[6:49:18] jambag00: Harry has always liked having some of his own money
[6:49:19] artguychris: Harry tyna milk those marlo packer runs
[6:49:25] joshbankai: BrownxMarlo Packer runs NODDERS
[6:49:28] omar_imp: i think he just too secretive
[6:49:30] Disihe211: omieL Love the RP. From everyone
[6:49:31] jryan701: avoids having too many cooks in the kitchen
[6:49:36] PakuroSama: @596950 ngl this is true , Marty just want all the dons validation and lang is the only one that doesn‚Äôt give it
[6:49:36] zodlez: You're doing great and you play a fantastic character
[6:49:38] TossTheBomb: Harry gets co-oped to often. Spread his wings
[6:49:45] SkyHawk0404: Yea sounds perfectly fine
[6:49:52] oneanimated: luci lang and harry took offense when marty said lang was the leader
[6:49:58] 596950: @pakurosama also like he said he thought buddha was the leader
[6:50:01] tenthBRETT_: Martin and tony are so much a like
[6:50:06] Messagge: i mean he got burned once before
[6:50:07] artguychris: @oneanimated that was such a tense moment haha
[6:50:10] PakuroSama: he had all those things before joining to be fair
[6:50:12] quadity2: Didn't he offer his entire farm, but was denied by Lang
[6:50:12] OccasionalTryHard: 4.0 Harry is the epitome of a hustler, should be admired honestly
[6:50:12] MarginallyNoted: Isn‚Äôt a bulk of the buttcoin Marty is farming, going into the cold storage @ the crew house? lolüòà
[6:50:13] oneanimated: it was
[6:50:16] AntzRede: Moonshine is not a crazy operation for now manageable with one person only
[6:50:17] RoronoaZoro: I think Marty joined the crew to do stuff with the crew if he‚Äôs just gonna start another crew then what‚Äôs the point of being with you guys in a way
[6:50:27] goodtimes54: @hengarath I think Marty is smart enough to realize he's not gonna be recognized or considered to be as a Don because he has money
[6:50:29] oneanimated: if only arush was there
[6:50:33] oneanimated: he wouldve clapped him lol
[6:50:43] qvbxx: ^
[6:50:46] its_ajc: @OccasionalTryHard 4.0 Harry is sick cause the crew relies on what he has rep for. Unlike 3.0 where lang could take everything away
[6:50:49] PakuroSama: true Harry
[6:50:50] mrdumpling420: Martin is a phenomenal hacker 2 lol I mean hes a smart kid. He could be a great asset
[6:50:58] saliromeo: @oneanimated Lmaoooo
[6:50:59] qvbxx: @oneanimated 10 times by now
[6:51:07] IanKeli: What's Martin's Twitch?
[6:51:09] loadingl_: marty just wants Friends
[6:51:10] CozyxVibes: that might be the talk/motivation he needs Harry
[6:51:10] PakuroSama: @mrdumpling420 he is great the group just needs to get thru this
[6:51:11] quadity2: @roronoazoro exactly
[6:51:14] its_ajc: !martin
[6:51:16] its_ajc: !marty
[6:51:16] Nightbot: You can find Martin 'Marty' Banks here -> https://www.twitch.tv/omie
[6:51:18] jryan701: he‚Äôs got so much potential his paranoia gets in his own way
[6:51:40] PakuroSama: but BESIDES all this i personally think the RP is great
[6:51:42] its_ajc: FLASH Pog
[6:51:49] saliromeo: people forget (or didn‚Äôt watch) what this group did to Octo LUL LUL
[6:51:50] Y_U_CRYIN: Teddy,Vito,Yuno all have there own small crew and running shit their way Marty can do that as well
[6:51:56] james_09_24_: how is the moonshine progress going?is it giving more money now?
[6:51:56] qvbxx: @mrdumpling420 so was Zaceed look where that ended
[6:51:59] AntzRede: They are great for this harrNODDERS
[6:52:23] its_ajc: your heavy breath there sounded like knut @Harry KEKW
[6:52:33] finsane1: totally scrap the %s it‚Äôs too complicated. just increase the dues massively
[6:52:48] joshbankai: Is Ilya still doing with the weed stuff while Speedy's gone?
[6:52:49] artguychris: this structure is definitely very good for long term growth
[6:52:51] OccasionalTryHard: @its_ajc Which is smart af if you ask me, In my work I try to be indispensable. Harry and a few others in that crew have that innately.. fudge the politics ima hustle and let my work ethic speak for me mentality
[6:53:04] PakuroSama: it felt like real GTA V
[6:53:05] KcsBack: it was epic lol
[6:53:06] saliromeo: @joshbankai yeah, he‚Äôs up for promotion
[6:53:07] OccasionalTryHard: Teddy got it, Octo dialed it in
[6:53:09] AntzRede: The egg KEKW
[6:53:09] epohs: It‚Äôs so simple. Marty wants Lang to be nicer to him.
[6:53:13] emiz0r: LuL
[6:53:14] finsane1: speedy has gotta be close to coming back right?
[6:53:16] husby123: LUL
[6:53:18] molineuxmedia: Classic
[6:53:21] its_ajc: egg incident Aware
[6:53:22] KcsBack: LUL
[6:53:22] emiz0r: lmao
[6:53:23] Dythronix: LUL
[6:53:26] alex61043: classic
[6:53:27] PakuroSama: @epohs true but lang explained he‚Äôs not gonna change who he is for anyvody
[6:53:28] joshbankai: @saliromeo whats the promotion like an underboss or something
[6:53:28] Sword_Scream: Not optimized egg dexterity.
[6:53:28] Panoramic_Views: at least it wasnt beans
[6:53:35] turbodyrock: KEKW
[6:53:35] LookAtThisTeam: peepoEGG
[6:53:40] epohs: @pakurosama 100%
[6:53:56] its_ajc: @OccasionalTryHard Yeah bro exactly, and i think a large portion of the crew is doing that too. Octo proved it all, he got dogged on and now hes like the best earner
[6:54:07] saliromeo: @joshbankai I don‚Äôt know if it has a name but he‚Äôll finally get keys and take over the weed from luciano
[6:54:16] joshbankai: honestly after the Dons, I don't know the structure at all other than the people answer to the Dons that they work under
[6:54:35] hashslingingslasher111: !gamba
[6:54:40] oneanimated: they really need to make the black book rules the gospel of the crew and hand it out to everyone who joins itll keep them inline
[6:54:58] joshbankai: @saliromeo Is Speedy out of it when he gets back and doing something else? I think I've missed some stuff
[6:55:35] saliromeo: @joshbankai Speedy wanted to be the war leader I think? I don‚Äôt remember what he called it
[6:55:40] OccasionalTryHard: @epohs It sounds simple, but how does Lang become nice to someone? Certainly not because they asked him to lol.. I believe in Marty 100% he will dial it in. But Langs respect is earned not handed out. Thats his character after all
[6:55:48] dootadoo: wtf was that
[6:56:02] ericasamerica: hasn‚Äôt it been more than 2 weeks now since Speedy went away?
[6:56:10] joshbankai: @saliromeo ah ok, I guess he'll be getting guns and such for the group?
[6:56:12] dootadoo: lang
[6:56:19] TheWitchAtWoolworths: L U R K I N G
[6:56:30] joshbankai: @ericasamerica not quite, it'll be 2 weeks this weekend I think
[6:56:33] Sablotron: everyone drinking that loneliness shot, but some feel they're drinking it alone. /pianomanplagiarism
[6:56:34] saliromeo: @joshbankai I don‚Äôt think he started yet
[6:56:52] lltundell: Lang rocking back and forth
[6:56:54] ericasamerica: @joshbankai  ugh! I miss Speedy!
[6:56:55] goodtimes54: I thought harry would come to a similar conclusion like he did with towing on how it was kinda lonely but maybe the occasional run in and benefit of not having to do repairs and gas helps with that a little
[6:56:56] JMaker24: imagine end game 4.0 is Harry wacking Vito Happy Halloween! ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm overcooking
[6:57:11] joshbankai: @lltundell I miss when Harry's character would do that when he got cuffed
[6:57:11] Sablotron: Lang's ACDC stance giving me ACDC.
[6:57:24] dootadoo: @Sablotron Good Metaphor
[6:57:32] saliromeo: when they buy in DeVito, imagine the confusion foheadDent
[6:58:03] joshbankai: @saliromeo Need to buy in Ahnold and call them the Twins
[6:58:07] iiidaaah: there is a devito and vito? I thought gigi was saying vito wrong before LOL
[6:58:09] Y_U_CRYIN: Y_U_CRYIN subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 3 month streak! great RP From everyone keep it up my man
[6:58:15] oneanimated: hopefully larry can knock some sense into marty
[6:58:27] joshbankai: @iiidaaah yeah it confuses everyone, DeVito needs a nickname lol
[6:58:32] ericasamerica: lang and Harry so cute together
[6:58:41] indyfaria: @oneanimated it‚Äôs not about that lmao
[6:58:43] JMaker24: good question from Vito
[6:58:50] liltoot07: i thought you were yelling in game when you said y u cryin KEKW
[6:59:00] weaseljuice84: you'll be getting my prime tomorrow gigachad harry

[6:59:50] joshbankai: @Sablotron lots of good yappers in the crew
[6:59:56] mogambo_khushhua: wait for lang talk\
[7:00:12] indyfaria: @oneanimated you are expecting larry to knock sense into Marty which it‚Äôs not about knocking sense into him
[7:00:43] indyfaria: @oneanimated it‚Äôs more about Marty understanding if he wants to be in and not take it to heart
[7:01:06] Messagge: @indyfaria marty has all the sense he needs it has nothing to do about that at all. the marty character has been through alot and just requires a little more "care"
[7:01:07] OccasionalTryHard: If this was IRL, I'd dread working for a guy like Lang.. but when it's all said and done I would 100000% owe all my success to him. Lang has an uncanny ability to make people better than they even think they can be. I've had a few hockey coaches like that in my day and I'm grateful

[7:01:41] indyfaria: @messagge I said that it‚Äôs not about knocking sense into him I know he has sense
[7:01:47] LietK: @jambag00 lose
[7:01:48] Robo_Cat2000: I don't think anyone would find this spot ngl
[7:01:49] OccasionalTryHard: ight enough novels I'm hopping on fortnite :P
[7:01:54] Messagge: @indyfaria was talking to the other guy

[7:02:47] jollysamson: whats happening oop
[7:02:55] drukkz: mrk POGGERS
[7:02:58] bigchimpo: harryRAT we cookin
[7:03:04] harislari: That is very specific name
[7:03:15] MarginallyNoted: My take from Marty bringing up the VU stuff was that it wasn‚Äôt meant to be an attack on Harry‚Äôs character. I think he was trying to point out that he was accused of scamming, when all he did was talk about how other members could use the VU to avoid giving a cut to the crew. Where as Harry actual used the VU. The fact that he only did it once & wasn‚Äôt trying to scam was irrelevant to his point. Again IMO‚Ä¶ respectfully! (allü§ç!)
[7:03:19] loadingl_: mrk POGGERS
[7:03:39] indyfaria: @marginallynoted agree
[7:04:50] xLegendori: @MarginallyNoted you make it easy to cross ban you when you type the same across your accounts KEKW
[7:04:57] buuutty: the only thing about the whole Marty conversation I didnt understand was why the dons didnt just say they feel like he brings drama to the group
[7:05:08] joshbankai: Harry the $500 scamma LUL
[7:05:14] chefchad1: We all know Marty isnt Langs fgavorite...and he wants to be
[7:05:19] artguychris: @buuutty because they're adults
[7:05:31] indyfaria: @buuutty at some point everyone will bring drama into the crew it‚Äôs life
[7:05:39] harislari: Having a lot of people cause miscommunication issue i guess, he thinks you didn't get shit about that
[7:05:45] Tiilde: I get where marty is coming from. Those days Marty spent with Harry growing, their convos felt more respectful to marty as a human being than how Lang talks to marty.
[7:05:46] buuutty: but wouldnt it make sense to just be honest
[7:05:47] artguychris: @buuutty lang did say it in other words
[7:05:48] Messagge: @artguychris adults address what needs to be addressed not leave things out
[7:06:03] TRAVree: sup Harold
[7:06:03] artguychris: @Messagge then lang said it
[7:06:19] its_ajc: arent you picking him up KEKW
[7:06:27] 596950: ppl fight all the time its gonna happen, how its handled its where things change
[7:06:28] tannerrobbz: @tiilde let‚Äôs me honest tho, that‚Äôs how Lang talks to almost everyone
[7:06:33] indyfaria: @tiilde it‚Äôs also like the person that brought him in doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúlike‚Äù him anymore it could feel a bit yk
[7:06:39] Messagge: @artguychris there is a difference between saying something and indirectly saying something
[7:06:51] Landarokz: Ima be honest, not sure what Marty wanted. Sounds like he want some empathetic hand-holding, but Lang Gang ain't about that life.
[7:06:55] kaumatizo: the rat life took over
[7:06:56] Sword_Scream: Brown ditched the world above the manhole.
[7:06:59] Sablotron: u ditched "growing" tbf
[7:07:00] TheNilknarf: It‚Äôs so easy to get caught up in the drama and feel passionately one way or the other.
[7:07:01] joshbankai: ding dong ditch
[7:07:02] indyfaria: Martin and Harry grows were the best
[7:07:08] artguychris: @Messagge marty is asking lang to say things that lang would never say because lang is an adult
[7:07:09] james_09_24_: it's just the timing
[7:07:09] loadingl_: marty and harry was friends Madge
[7:07:10] g0m3rrrr: what about *blocked* incident :D :D
[7:07:10] zxJroc: harryRAT
[7:07:12] theduckmarley: ditching someone implies it was personal or intentional
[7:07:14] SkyHawk0404: You're just busy working on your stuff like everyone else working on their stuff
[7:07:20] TheNilknarf: What really matters the most is WE MISS DOIGIE
[7:07:24] TheNilknarf: DOUGIE
[7:07:25] Tiilde: @tannerrobbz  you say that but Yuno and tony is an example of it being a bit different
[7:07:28] errrrrrL: martin and your phone number KEKW
[7:07:32] 596950: @landarokz its no that he wants validation from lang thars about it, its why he only has issue w him
[7:07:45] artguychris: i miss those marty harry runs
[7:07:45] Messagge: @artguychris if someone asks an adult what they truly feel about them. they answer with the truth end of story
[7:07:51] Tiilde: @indyfaria  this also.
[7:07:52] jungbenzo: Chatting
[7:07:57] joshbankai: Harry ditches everyone Kappa
[7:08:02] izzygus333: i hope it can work out w marty but idk anymore Sadge
[7:08:03] artguychris: @Messagge that's not true at all, that's childish
[7:08:08] JonnyTruelove: Chatting
[7:08:13] broxx1: @Tiilde ??? bro Lang shits on Tony all day everyday KEKW
[7:08:13] indyfaria: @tiilde it‚Äôs way different Yuno and tony for lang it‚Äôs a different relationship
[7:08:16] tannerrobbz: @tiilde you don‚Äôt think Lang gives it to Tony??
[7:08:18] Messagge: @artguychris delusion
[7:08:30] TheNilknarf: Land definitely lets Tony have it.
[7:08:31] RoronoaZoro: @izzygus333 it definitely doesn‚Äôt seem like it will after that conversation
[7:08:35] Panoramic_Views: yeah he looking for other people to validate his issue with  Lang
[7:08:36] washed_up_wapiti: lang do cut his discussion very short with him.
[7:08:37] TossTheBomb: Martin new yaegar Sadge
[7:08:46] broxx1: FACTS
[7:08:51] artguychris: @Messagge nah, lang is all business, you're asking for lang to act like a drama queen
[7:08:51] husby123: dougie PepeHands
[7:08:53] JasmineWynn: Dougie Sadge
[7:08:54] errrrrrL: real
[7:08:56] indyfaria: @thenilknarf tony and lang have known eachother for 7 years so it‚Äôs way different
[7:08:57] RevolverBoss: Sadge
[7:08:57] harislari: The way lang talks caused the issue
[7:08:58] aanzio: exactly
[7:09:02] KcsBack: Sadge
[7:09:05] 596950: This feels very much like yeager-buddha in 3 0 lol
[7:09:07] Juancr6579: I love Dougie
[7:09:09] Messagge: @artguychris stating facts and being a drama queen are two different things
[7:09:14] THE_ETHAN0L: Marty's talents are heisting so maybe he should be involved in that
[7:09:16] izzygus333: @RoronoaZoro buddhaSad
[7:09:19] Anxietiez: Anxietiez subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! The Wall is walking on a wall
[7:09:32] errrrrrL: meeting without HR??
[7:09:37] TheNilknarf: @indyfaria You‚Äôre right it‚Äôs different. but he definitely doesn‚Äôt let Tony have it easy.
[7:09:40] artguychris: @Messagge lang's stated the facts, you're asking for lang to say that he doesn't like marty
[7:09:40] Sablotron: here we go
[7:09:48] jambag00: imo martin is being a lil bitch but i also dont know if he knows what he bought into really....
[7:09:52] mel0yelo: .........
[7:09:54] joshbankai: Harry's heist crew.... Marty, Octo, Dougie, Clem and Ilya Kappa
[7:09:58] AnitaBowl: now lang is going to say how he really feels instead of saying it to Martin
[7:10:04] Messagge: @artguychris no not saying he doesnt like marty. saying what his problem is
[7:10:04] KcsBack: hmmMeeting
[7:10:19] artguychris: @Messagge you want lang to tell marty to his face he's a little bitch?
[7:10:25] TheNilknarf: Lang will give it to everyone but certain people definitely will get it worse.
[7:10:40] TheNilknarf: He does bust Martins balls pretty hard.
[7:10:49] 596950: Buddha got it lmaoo
[7:10:49] NoTaGain15151: approval
[7:10:53] jollysamson: tell him you love him daddy BibleThump
[7:10:55] Messagge: @artguychris in an adult way sure
[7:10:59] 596950: he not wrong tbh
[7:11:03] Yusuke429: marty wants daddy lang
[7:11:06] martymagoo78: feel like there is a little 3.0 bias there from Marty
[7:11:07] TheNilknarf: So what exactly was said by Martin chat?
[7:11:09] KrisCat: LUL ott catching strays
[7:11:09] artguychris: @Messagge he did in the most adult ways possible
[7:11:22] bigchimpo: LUL
[7:11:25] saliromeo: Love OTT
[7:11:27] husby123: the king

[7:11:30] izzygus333: OTT <3 buddhaKing
[7:11:31] chelle_mx: ott is such comedy
[7:11:40] KrisCat: we love the king
[7:11:53] Fusalol: gigi is shadow leader
[7:12:07] Fusalol: with yuno
[7:12:08] mr_booosh: I think he meant leader like the queen compared to the primeminister
[7:12:09] humorii: wheres aumilly :( can i get a tldr of today lol
[7:12:11] TheNilknarf: I mean Lang is the glue that keeps it all together
[7:12:14] jayruff65: the whole city tbh
[7:12:47] pjrobs: from a viewer perspective OOC, lang does feel like the leader but maybe im still too attached to the 3.0 structure
[7:12:51] TheNilknarf: Might be time to thin out the crew
[7:13:01] turbodyrock: sure but there are 5 donds
[7:13:05] turbodyrock: *dons
[7:13:07] TheNilknarf: @pjrobs I agree.
[7:13:09] Sablotron: easy fix. put a name to the crew, call it "The Five" clear all doubts in one go.
[7:13:43] just_that_1_guy: hi harry! justth79GuyO7
[7:13:46] RoronoaZoro: @sablotron a name isn‚Äôt gonna change how people view things
[7:13:48] Westoffer: @pjrobs he kinda guides the direction and is the one pushing everyone to do something
[7:13:48] finalgambitsiebs: harrPray
[7:14:02] TheNilknarf: So Martin just spoke out on his issues with Lang as the ‚Äúleader‚Äù ???
[7:14:02] mrfunvg: being a don is suffering through these meetings
[7:14:12] JonnyTruelove: harrLaff TeaTime
[7:14:24] jollysamson: cumstacking FeelsStrongMAN
[7:14:33] pjrobs: @Westoffer @Westoffer exactly
[7:14:34] mr_booosh: other than the vote how does harry lead?
[7:14:43] tannerrobbz: they can‚Äôt keep holding onto hope here that this will work
[7:15:03] chefchad1: X/GG/CB/OB
[7:15:04] JMaker24: Marty wants femly but the crew is bidneh aside from the dons they femly mostly
[7:15:05] chelle_mx: hm
[7:15:16] spolito12: spolito12 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months, currently on a 5 month streak! boom!
[7:15:39] AnitaBowl: didn't lang say it was a group of friends working towards the same goal?
[7:15:49] pjrobs: marty and lang just have huge personality clashes
[7:16:04] TheNilknarf: I think ideally they want it to be a democracy with the Dons being the leader/decision makers but it does come across that Lang is kind of higher ranking than anyone else.
[7:16:12] JoeKsova: Marty just wants people to chill with LUL
[7:16:13] artguychris: BOOM
[7:16:17] 596950: @anitabowl  he did his chat even warned him if i remember
[7:16:18] artguychris: Gigi is so dank
[7:16:19] TheNilknarf: idk if that‚Äôs because of 3.0 or him being a partner but
[7:16:19] Miiharbii: Marty asked for a gun to shoot back and Lang didn‚Äôt agree to deal with it like that
[7:16:22] RoronoaZoro: Marty wanted a group to fill the void of gg and this group doesn‚Äôt really do that
[7:16:32] Viper0922: gigi on point
[7:16:37] Nightbot: If you have Amazon Prime you can sub to Harry for FREE, just go to https://twitch.amazon.com/prime activate it, come back and subscribe free of charge.

[7:16:54] Shieldsy1: love this spot
[7:16:58] AntzRede: Raised him LUL
[7:17:07] buuutty: lang complains about marty all the time he just doesnt tell him about it
[7:17:14] TheNilknarf: And there inlays the issue at its core. Jean Paul raised him lol
[7:17:15] jollysamson: he had to his dad jp and now he wants his new dad lang to accept him
[7:17:27] izzygus333: i dont thiink langs assimtions are right
[7:17:30] JMaker24: he wants to be a gaffa but little does he know there‚Äôs only one gaffa: Harry Brown
[7:17:47] izzygus333: assumptions
[7:18:00] TheNilknarf: He wants to be more involved without having put in the work it seems.
[7:18:02] Shieldsy1: @JMaker24 LULW
[7:18:28] KrisCat: Gigi is hr now also
[7:18:31] Ketel_One: Marty has been the leader of Gang Gang for years, and is also used to a ton of SBS, daily. This crew is the opposite of both. That's the issue..imo
[7:18:39] slickytiger: Marty taking everything tonight PrideHeartL PrideHeartR
[7:19:12] EyeScraem: marty could run his own crew while still working with this crew NODDERS
[7:19:16] JessCee7: Lang told him no tho
[7:19:16] TheNilknarf: That Casino has been his baby since the beginning though
[7:19:17] helveesti: @Ketel_One Juno is personified sbs and has a good spot in the crew tho
[7:19:23] helveesti: Juno*
[7:19:36] saliromeo: @helveesti Juno?? lmao
[7:19:37] artguychris: @EyeScraem that's more or less what the system was made out to be
[7:19:42] chefchad1: Speedy would know what to do.
[7:19:45] 596950: @helveesti u mean yuno? if so yuno doesnt like gang bang
[7:19:47] EyeScraem: @artguychris yea but I don't think marty understands that
[7:20:12] RoronoaZoro: @artguychris I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what Marty wants though I think he wants to do stuff with this crew not make another which is the disconnect
[7:20:14] TheNilknarf: He just needs to get with the program, or don‚Äôt. Get out.
[7:20:21] Shieldsy1: speedy would say martins being a shnake
[7:20:29] matterwave23: If Marty isn't out today, he is out this Friday when asked to give 25k.
[7:20:34] artguychris: @RoronoaZoro it's interesting because he could be doing that with larry
[7:20:35] TheNilknarf: schnake for sure.
[7:21:10] RoronoaZoro: @artguychris yeah but I think that‚Äôs why issues came up after the jp thing because he lost his day to day people which filled the void of joining Lang and everyone
[7:21:17] ReyFrancis_: porkti1PorkySip
[7:21:24] odd_frost: so confusing
[7:21:36] artguychris: @RoronoaZoro he still has friends tho right?
[7:21:46] buuutty: lang on his gaslight game again
[7:21:48] dootadoo: CarlSmile LeanTime
[7:22:11] TheNilknarf: Someone said Lang told him no on that but Langs saying he didn‚Äôt.
[7:22:12] Mhysamari: Idk I feel like all these meetings assuming thing about someone when they're not there to defend themselves is kinda part of the problem
[7:22:19] sk8carl: xqcDespair
[7:22:23] RoronoaZoro: @artguychris I think all that‚Äôs around when he‚Äôs mainly around is Larry
[7:22:45] TheNilknarf: Assumptions are all you can go on when someone isn‚Äôt giving you straight answers.
[7:22:45] Luthercorpz: Hold the racks cuh timmacTHINK
[7:22:55] Sablotron: ehhh. but then he brings up how all the coins needed for the weapon parts were his
[7:23:10] saliromeo: @sablotron literally
[7:23:11] artguychris: @RoronoaZoro he needs to realize he has pull and that he can start his own shit
[7:23:11] novakcsn: novakcsn subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months! harrL
[7:23:24] tommygunz_212: Gigi is spot on
[7:23:42] sk8carl: stop the cap
[7:23:44] RoronoaZoro: @artguychris yeah but if it starts his own thing doesn‚Äôt it kinda become like what‚Äôs the point of being bought in with Lang and everyone in a way
[7:24:05] AnitaBowl: why not tell him that?
[7:24:16] bbriar: Some highschool drama KEKW
[7:24:18] shortsaga: I love watching new people get introduced to LB/CB comms I am laughing my ass off
[7:24:20] Shieldsy1: he just said why
[7:24:25] artguychris: @RoronoaZoro i dont think so, cause long term, the relationship with this group as a highly valued member has great benefits
[7:24:28] valientegamer: Don's dont need to give a reason to non-Don
[7:24:36] TheNilknarf: I mean I think Lang would but he doesn‚Äôt have to.
[7:24:51] mel0yelo: with only 5k runs now of that will work
[7:24:53] qvbxx: he only knows about capital bcz he has keys
[7:24:55] TheNilknarf: Also Martin doesn‚Äôt always hear what‚Äôs actually being said.
[7:24:56] Techsticle: eatt
[7:24:57] 596950: tell he has no problem w marty to him, afterwards says the problem lol
[7:25:04] Sablotron: @AnitaBowl because Lang wants Marty to grow up (as a character) on his own, versus the "holding hand" he dislikes so much.
[7:25:28] TheNilknarf: @sablotron exactly
[7:25:28] archivedior: lang characters constant movement makes me anxious lol

[7:26:21] WeeeeD: we need round 2
[7:26:21] artguychris: @AnitaBowl i half disagree, the point is to put his head down and regain good standing
[7:26:24] jambag00: @AnitaBowl gaslighting?
[7:26:33] The_Orange_Flash: PINKY????
[7:26:35] TheNilknarf: Seems like issues with Martin are just such a regular occurrence.
[7:26:43] Niconamnam: haha think if speedy was here.. it would have been so sick
[7:26:44] Miiharbii: eh it wasn‚Äôt a slight because Marty believes it
[7:26:46] The_Orange_Flash: wouldn't put it past luci to say that LUL
[7:26:49] Sablotron: KEKW
[7:26:55] artguychris: that was literally group therapy
[7:27:05] broxx1: @Niconamnam Speedy woulda already shot Marty KEKW
[7:27:15] archivedior: why don‚Äôt they just give Marty probation and move on.
[7:27:17] Niconamnam: XD

[7:27:26] artguychris: @archivedior 5 DAPs
[7:27:26] RoronoaZoro: @artguychris I mean a character like Marty could have had those relationships in a way without buying in like others have and will I just think what Marty wants this crew doesn‚Äôt offer him unfortunately

[7:28:28] Lakers1nation: @archivedior type of alien
[7:28:31] artguychris: @archivedior lol, it's the PD demerit system that's got the server in an uproar
[7:28:33] 596950: very easy to solve lang tells marty he has problems w him and see how marty reacts(probably leaves) boom
[7:28:38] sk8carl: I like Marty :(
[7:28:50] TheNilknarf: Idk if that‚Äôs just because she‚Äôs always neutral or something else
[7:28:54] Shieldsy1: everyone likes marty
[7:29:04] archivedior: @artguychris oh yeah, Dean got fired because of that lol

[7:29:39] Sablotron: empathy doesn't compute in Lang's mind harrNODDERS
[7:29:39] Coolboarder80: Only wants Lang's approval, n nothing else is the issue
[7:29:40] Westoffer: thats why yaeger is the way he is

[7:53:31] KingDekar: @dogma4202112 the main issue is him ONLY bringing it up to Lang to get approval form Lang, where as he can just DO IT. or say it to any of the other Dons or higher ups

[7:55:28] Shieldsy1: not a tip sucking crew for sure
[7:55:29] The__Donkey: lang just said marty has 0 value and that attitude definitely comes out from him in their conversations
[7:55:30] deadpaint_tm: if all these characters were the same no one would be watching
[7:55:36] edoho87: Lang wants everyone to be a leader and independent
[7:55:41] KrisCat: yeah, that's why they didn't want donations, didn't want ppl throwing it in the crew's face how much they gave to the crew w/ nothing in return.

[7:57:08] jambag00: marty could always get validation and put blame on JP... now he wants to do that to leadr langy
[7:57:21] yellowtristan: god I miss Denzel, he really was a balance, same with Leslie
[7:57:24] beatdareaper: these young bucks too emotional
[7:57:31] deadpaint_tm: the server seems to have gotten more diverse since then that‚Äôs a good thing IMO
[7:57:31] oneanimated: gigi is the better version of eve and nancy put together without the emotional attachment and lang admires it.
[7:57:33] TheNilknarf: Oh damn I haven‚Äôt heard from him in a long while.
[7:57:38] MarginallyNoted: Gege was also handed a valuable roll. I‚Äôd bet with how Marty‚Äôs brain works & being an ex-leader, he would be just as valuable if he had been handed the Treasurer‚Äôs job‚Ä¶ then maybe he would get paise from Lang! üòàüòàüòà
