[4:27:03] LocalTrey: wonder how much of the furniture stuff the small bench can craft?
[4:27:07] gingerchris86: it creates RP too, because it makes people question if their character wants to sleep on the floor
[4:27:09] azmer1987: @a_humble_wooper I can't help it PepeHands
[4:27:09] doc_sharon: strike while the grind and demand are high
[4:27:09] A_Humble_Wooper: And eventually people will have their homes set up, so demand will slow down that way too.
[4:27:15] Thorn104: we heard him earlier :P
[4:27:15] KarnEvil: ya, Nikea hit at the perfect time.  Citys been moving a while now so everyone has cash, but not everyone has tried making their own furniture yet to get the blueprints.
[4:27:18] Insaif: It's a ton of work with all the mats that are needed and the time investment. But it's also great RP>
[4:27:18] frsttyyy: billy too

[6:28:36] arbucklezero: Was that not accounted for already in the cost?
[6:28:47] Insaif: @arbucklezero Labor was not accounted for.
[6:28:50] PacMan419: wood is budgeted at 10 per so easy payroll
[6:28:54] Siirika: Tbf, the Wood is technically accounted for in the costs
[6:29:20] A_Humble_Wooper: I dunno, ARE they right?
[6:29:27] doc_sharon: we can't see them, so katesShrug
[6:29:47] Insaif: I think the prices for wood and some things are based on what you can sell it to the NPC for, right?

[6:30:29] PacMan419: and no 10k
[6:30:31] CozyTeaSipper: and a lot of mats and products in-flight
[6:30:31] Insaif: The fabric is one of the biggest costs you have to deal with. NODDERS
[6:30:39] AshuraX13: Yeah, not being able to source cheap fabric is eating into it NODDERS
[6:30:41] doc_sharon: oh yeah Lang did not pay yet

[6:32:23] Insaif: It would be really cool if you could somehow make your own fabric at some point. Maybe from pelts from hunting or something.
[6:32:29] Crazith: as per 3.0 there was only a few days were nothing was updated on a tsunami, so anything is possible
[6:32:46] Kthanid: Unless they add in like...flax growing for linen there's only u-tool fabric.

[6:39:22] A_Humble_Wooper: Some rubbish wall art could be cool tho.
[6:39:22] CozyTeaSipper: Now this was some kind of anti-climax, just a regular customer instead of murder and mayhem.
[6:39:31] Insaif: I know exactly the style they're going for, but I think Nikea might be a bit higher class than what she's wanting.
