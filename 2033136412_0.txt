[9:07:26] hemmorj: and he chose the wrong person
[9:07:35] KorbenDallas815: he easily could've extorted you SOME money for the key to be sold back
[9:07:35] FlowersFerdinand: back in the day they would rob Ming but nowadays they see him as a beta male and rob his ass
[9:07:35] GoRibGo: the way keys work is probably the main problem here. they're too expensive probably for one
[9:07:35] alphadomfan: what did i miss
[9:07:41] FlowersFerdinand: wouldn’t

[9:08:16] vewybig: speedy out shnaking the mrbongSnake
[9:08:17] Eatchy_: tbh someone can copy a key and not even rob him from your pocket OMEGALUL
[9:08:18] AWC_Tobi: key does not decay if you copy it right?
[9:08:19] iKickMyself: its deeper rp than just returning it
[9:08:23] MattarChawal: @javy0909 U really think speedy of all people ain’t got a house?
[9:08:23] Eatchy_: rob it*
[9:08:39] CourierV221: you gotta think about what you take before you take it

[9:08:51] realitijd24: theres no animation and shit aswell
[9:08:53] pacollama: aint no way that is that fast
[9:08:53] ffs_dave_: Should just have a key slot that can't be taken
[9:08:54] p13row: genius
[9:08:55] Kavicsftw: nah thats way too crazy
[9:08:56] javy0909: @CourierV221 i am asking...does he?

[9:09:00] Devbringer97: is there a animation if u copy?
[9:09:01] ptvgrjbdr: That System needs tweaking, it's way too easy to copy a key
[9:09:02] NebelKop: but its a lil powerfull no?
[9:09:02] Ciaaattt: 5Head
[9:09:05] zvidrvhim: @awc_tobi no thats the only way to have multiple keys so it won't decay
[9:09:06] lety_r1: someone robbed buddhas key too.
[9:09:07] ComfyAura: right now the only people who have keys are people that probably shouldnt be messed with
[9:09:08] WeebRemover: should be an animation for that ngl
[9:09:09] purpleSCREAM: that's dumb
[9:09:13] Eatchy_: copying key need a animation tbh
[9:09:19] waterexpert: Reminds me of when zaceed took Langs key for the H stuff and didn’t know what to do with it
[9:09:23] superloika: hit back harder bro
[9:09:28] somebadtiming: Rep getting there
[9:09:29] KorbenDallas815: there are so many ways to chance the current 'key system'
[9:09:32] mick_thor: what was the rep now?
[9:09:35] Zero_no_name: I can see the key system being changed
[9:09:42] JackOrvilleTrades: need to be able to boof keys like in escape from tarkov
[9:09:43] zvidrvhim: They should make it so only the owner can buy real house keys and copy keys decay over time or after one use @ming
[9:09:43] CourierV221: @javy0909 what?
[9:09:47] shicwow: @4headsjellybelly what are u talkin about. if they didnt want keys to be taken, they wouldnt made keys a thing. Obv devs wanted ppl to be able to take them
[9:09:50] ComfyAura: key cutter on you robbing would be nuts though
[9:09:53] FoursideWOW: should be 65 right?
[9:09:56] NebelKop: Yeah
[9:10:04] waterexpert: True
[9:10:06] NebelKop: Its kinda bad
[9:10:08] FireNoCap: hired goons
[9:10:15] Kavicsftw: maybe copying keys should be only possible in house benches?
[9:10:16] altoidstin1: It should be a keycode not a physical key maybe
[9:10:18] 90honeydew: that’s why Marty was freaking out
[9:10:18] KorbenDallas815: more so when guns come out, it's FUCKED
[9:10:18] GoRibGo: set up some rust type alarms tied to an app on your phone lol
[9:10:19] Celascion: you'll have to hire security at all times i guess
[9:10:25] asetas: Marty gonna need to have security around him at all time
[9:10:26] KorbenDallas815: not cop guns
[9:10:31] ptvgrjbdr: Random mfs blacked out shouldn't rob people in the first place, that's not RP that's GTA online shit
[9:10:31] vahtu: used to do that to ppl on rust all the time OMEGALUL
[9:10:32] marwan880p: it would be better if fancy houses got more security
[9:10:32] zvidrvhim: Just slash me swallow key whenever that happens LUL
[9:10:36] pacollama: marty gonna spend all his profit on security
[9:10:40] Hachiman1997: That's why you need to be responsible and minimize the number of keys
[9:10:40] RU8H: gotta have airlocks mhm
[9:10:40] onix146: even with sec, all it takes is one of the pd gun holders
[9:10:41] ffs_dave_: @shicwow fair point- even if you were a bit aggy with it
[9:10:41] Kloakheesten0: just gotta start bussin

[9:13:29] enjoylife4789: ming gonna get his get back best believe
[9:13:30] fublian: I think there should be 2 types of keys. 1 set that the goverment needs to know about. That cannot be robbed. But if yu wanna be lowkey you need a key like this that can be robbed
[9:13:32] bjerre6969: how many deals is a run?
[9:13:32] coinage8: need some henchmen
[9:13:35] ptvgrjbdr: The way it gets robbed matters tho, some rp reason behind it should be a thing
[9:13:41] ComfyAura: i kinda like the key system for the most part so you can rob player houses later seems sick
[9:13:47] NebelKop: @zsouldark22 so ppl start code raiding 😭
[9:13:57] gigachris33: @hello_kinnie That’s my point, neither should houses. Owner should just have an allowlist with the city
[9:14:02] taxism: guard dog mhm
[9:14:02] ptvgrjbdr: Or an alarm

[9:14:21] NebelKop: LMFAO
[9:14:22] Kavicsftw: alarm doesnt really make sense because they have the key chat
[9:14:25] Me4onyX: something with a passcode perhaps
[9:14:30] rosco2357: Different doors with different keys
[9:14:31] otherJ99: mhm water on roof

[9:15:08] LightByLion: c4 mhm
[9:15:09] mortuusintus12: dez got a security feature yesterday with that free fall trap
[9:15:09] errata_Matt: Passcode lock would make the most sense

[9:15:12] peachykeem: 2FA for the house
[9:15:15] ohwoww123: Mini nuke under the steps

[9:15:55] Hachiman1997: @fares980  yessss
[9:15:55] BoywithVIP: RareChar RareChar RareChar
[9:15:58] DroopBTW: @shams267 That wouldn't be that good tho if there's illegal stuff in the house and cops decide to "check" the house and bust the owners for illegal shit lol
[9:15:59] ViewtifulAye: passlock prob the best option - and if they want house raids to be a thing you'd have to do a computer hack to get peoples codes
[9:16:00] vewybig: numeric passcode to door that can be hacked
[9:16:02] zvidrvhim: And this shit is already a problem now wait till there be guns on the server
[9:16:05] callmequaddie: a pack of dogs with mini guns and flamethrowers

[9:16:36] shoto__o: digital lock where you enter a code
[9:16:41] shicwow: @fares980 thats like changing locks it server the same purpose. With card maybe more convient and cheaper but maybe t his is what devs want. I like it personally
[9:16:45] NebelKop: one shitter could make soo much dmg...
[9:17:00] zvidrvhim: Wait till some group pulls up 6 deep with class 2s and send you back to the stone age LUL
[9:17:03] javy0909: alarm system when unauthorised keys are used - automatically main key owners get notified
[9:17:16] lecitin: alarm
[9:17:21] FireNoCap: only the owner can modify right? so a hidden barrel under the floorboard maybe
[9:17:29] coinage8: hi good day

[9:17:43] zvidrvhim: Honeycomb the interior LUL

[9:18:17] onix146: GrinderW underground stashes
[9:18:19] fares980: @fares980 I do not suggest change. I see it as adding a door lock service for a fee
[9:18:32] DroopBTW: @Ming What did you and Andy/Lollypop get up to? I went to sleep when you guys were at the tattoo shop
[9:18:34] NebelKop: i mean grow cost
[9:18:36] ComfyAura: almost there boss keep it up GrinderW
[9:18:46] anitamaxwynn0: you should be making profit in the upcoming runs right
[9:18:51] svan223: @octoni0 they sh ould make a rule that taking a key needs to have RP involved to take it liek randomly robbing someoen you cant take the key etc should be a rule
[9:18:57] waterexpert: @nebelkop Dhead said cost to grow was 300 for a brick
[9:19:16] DroopBTW: Ahh ok. I think Ring pop Records is gonna pop off
