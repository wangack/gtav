[9:39:18] Shunne93: Yes they should make it cheaper tbh
[9:39:19] grimblymcgoo: a new lock is like $50, not 3500
[9:39:19] MadTape6: then again if someone get your key they don't have access to the barrels and stashes in your house
[9:39:22] Shunne93: Dunno why it costs so much
[9:39:23] MeButWhy: irl you probably dont know which house it is

[9:39:37] Drezmar: or have a security system like Rust
[9:39:40] Frozencurse: if you lose your key, noone cant know exactly what it opens, i f it gets stolen is harder
[9:39:44] limesacul: bruh wtf
[9:39:46] BurningFlag: Right now with only 1 house is risky but with a couple of houses and not have everything on one spot will make it better
[9:39:47] Tamzim: People sometime hand it into Cops
[9:39:50] ShreddedFPS: if you lose ingame a key, they easy can check pixelpad for sold houses and try these on them
[9:39:51] ChrisPNutssss: a new lock should'nt be more than $200
