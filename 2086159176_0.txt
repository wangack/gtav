[4:19:51] dakota22446: DinoDance
[4:20:13] justind33: Do you want to let Beric know about the wrong charge case?
[4:20:21] layla109: @flugel_binder Somewhat but also, a lot of people still come to Slacks. lol Idk how today has been.
[4:20:25] DanLGG: What wrong charge case
[4:20:35] seedubbleyou: @justind33 That's backseating my dude
[4:20:35] eqnjn: doesn't Siobahn has like a million ideas for this budget stuff
[4:21:10] TJ88Norway: @Wort3xx Yeah, we can only hope.
[4:22:12] ForgottenJones: ???
[4:22:13] flugel_binder: ^bruh lol
[4:22:13] StreamElements: What they said saabThat
[4:22:19] DanLGG: That dudes name was bout to be my response to that comment. Nah brother
[4:22:20] devintalktech: RP chat is way too fuckin wild lately
[4:22:21] MsFreya_x: wot
[4:22:27] just_james69: @tj88norway  is it true most Scandinavian countries dislike Denmark? LUL
[4:22:32] dakota22446: sniper
[4:22:39] WildWillie419: They’d be an additional source I think he’s saying
[4:22:41] RedBeardsActual: it adds more people who can approve if its judges plus whoever the PD says is ok
[4:22:59] flugel_binder: that was a quick no scope mods SeemsGood
[4:23:09] blazemarley: that was giga unhinged
[4:23:14] sharky_00_: LUL LUL
[4:23:16] blazemarley: jesus rp chatters are something classic
[4:23:20] dakota22446: wideduckass
[4:23:32] phiilosophyy: Could the percentage that officers get when fining someone go towards like a PD budget instead of into an officers personal account? basically giving the PD a budget instead of waiting for a budget from the council @ssaab
[4:24:01] flugel_binder: PopNemo DoritosChip PopCorn
[4:24:11] msdeell: hell no
[4:24:17] dakota22446: PotFriend
[4:24:31] dakota22446: make beric fart YUMP
[4:24:34] TastyKudzu: No one's going to surrender. They're just going to get a lawyer to tell them what the charges are then they're going to outrun it.
[4:24:59] TastyKudzu: And if it's not rigid then their friend cop will tell them ruining someone else's investigation.
[4:25:00] flugel_binder: Ssaab should enable tts ai voices lol
[4:25:12] rekcoj: wasnt ramee doing it? or am i misunderstanding him
[4:25:17] rekcoj: and some other lawyers too
[4:25:43] TJ88Norway: @just_james69 No, i would not say so, but "it's a thing" like "my country is the best.. etc".. :p Like Denmark and Norway used to be one country before, etc..
[4:25:45] lookingfornothinghere: DinoDance
[4:25:56] theonepieces: the counsel is being hunted let them die  lebronJAM
[4:26:00] arcswo: Not having a district attorney in Los Santos makes for some interesting problems
[4:26:31] DanLGG: I think the 15% should go into PD budget rather personal. Imagine a robbery where 6 cops respond and all put in the same amount of work. Only 1 person gets money back if someone is arrested.
[4:26:36] flugel_binder: the dans LUL
[4:26:39] ForgottenJones: holy the dans and littlemens
[4:26:48] buddha_hands: that's not good lmao
[4:26:55] flugel_binder: thats gonna be some shit show
[4:27:09] pqm11: aint got enough cops for that lol
[4:27:21] Van_1912: what if someone is kidnapped and brought INTO the prison?
[4:27:23] buddha_hands: so hold up.. if someone commits murder in there & it's on tape, and then they leave prison.... ??
[4:27:37] buddha_hands: or if theyre shooting from inside to the outside??
[4:27:47] arcswo: @buddha_hands It wont matter if they do it inside the gates
[4:28:02] seedubbleyou: Shooting into Los Santos is different @buddha_hands
[4:28:08] flugel_binder: its like the walking dead
[4:28:10] eqnjn: The warrants thing is worth an announcement probably
[4:28:12] postAmongUsist: @DanLGG the thing is, the 15% is good to incentivize paperwork. 6 officers participated, but if u want the 15% u have to write the report and do the processing Shrug
[4:28:17] ITZxJeff: what time is that at?
[4:28:18] TJ88Norway: Border patrol would be kinda fun, haha :p
[4:28:19] arcswo: Yeah shooting outside would be an outside crime
[4:28:22] theonepieces: the prison is fucked @buddha_hands
[4:28:26] MWRGaming: you could use officer involved tab like what CoP did for Ass Chief applications
[4:28:26] sweartome: so the pd will be arresting and sending people who break the law, to a place where there are no laws lol
[4:29:04] seanlew123: lol
[4:29:12] buddha_hands: it's still a state facility too so like..
[4:29:22] taraannee: how is it not a problem if ppl throw guns over the fence into the prison lmao
[4:29:24] lookingfornothinghere: New prison might be more Pepega than sanguine
[4:29:30] mammothballs7: common sense where the laws end sounds like a book
[4:29:32] RedBeardsActual: Escape from LA type shit
[4:29:34] KajLovesData: how are you feeling? hope you're feeling better @Ssaab
[4:29:38] ForgottenJones: oh no
[4:29:38] seedubbleyou: @buddha_hands But it's being treated as a privately owned or controlled prison
[4:29:49] ForgottenJones: personal or state ?
[4:29:49] flugel_binder: prison sounds like a great place to rehabilitate LUL
[4:29:55] theonepieces: not by the law @buddha_hands
[4:29:57] arcswo: None of this really matters because the majority of people spend like 10 minutes in prision
[4:30:00] TJ88Norway: Maby some people will RP as lifers again? :p
[4:30:22] DanLGG: @postAmongUsist but even being the officer that charges the other officers are still required to write a statement, collect evidence
[4:30:28] thebigshabam: no state backing
[4:30:34] thebigshabam: risky
[4:30:41] RedBeardsActual: yeah no way
[4:30:44] TJ88Norway: So risky.. :p
[4:30:44] layla109: Yeah
[4:31:38] flugel_binder: claim bankrupcy LUL
[4:31:46] riftshadow: WHAT! If you had the money, you would not have needed the Loan, so if they cannot go into the negative. Then you can never get your money back.
[4:31:49] yetisarentreal: Good GIGACHAD
[4:31:53] seedubbleyou: Banks take L's everyday on people that won't pay
[4:32:08] thxmuhs: when is the last time Slacks arrested someone
[4:32:20] RoninGundam: ppl gonna have chapter 7 bankruptcies listed on their profile
[4:32:27] dakota22446: Pointless
[4:32:28] ForgottenJones: Mr.
[4:32:30] ForgottenJones: K
[4:32:34] quote_me_if_horsen: get loan, give money to friend, repeat, get rich
[4:32:37] thebigshabam: just make sure the loan is less than the collat
[4:32:38] yetisarentreal: He's lik the only active captain right now LUL
[4:32:42] layla109: @RoninGundam LUL
[4:32:51] SG8970: He arrested duncan's heart FeelsWowMan
[4:32:54] eqnjn: Officers cannot edit the announcement to add their name @Ssaab , only HC can do that
[4:33:02] Artsii1994: Sounds like when saab was gonna pay back Marlo for his car
[4:33:06] layla109: lol
[4:33:07] RedBeardsActual: KEKW
[4:33:11] GYNECHIATRIST: xdd
[4:33:17] riftshadow: So, you only need to take out a loan for things like houses or cars, which you can get the asset for and sell for recovery.
