[0:43:29] SpaceOlympix: it works both ways
[0:43:34] Phasehero: Video chatting with therapists is a faster way to talk to one.
[0:43:39] TheDanikay: poly isn't just sexual. it's having other relationships that don't involve the other person
[0:43:39] swoleMaz: polyamorous is ethical non-monogamy
[0:43:44] tony_not_toni: good morning chat
[0:43:44] SebasBP28: she then said: call me LUL
[0:43:45] Clifto: unfortunately thats not how it works, one could be poly and other could be mono
[0:43:46] aladdin_mck: i heard psychologists are better than therapists  but idk

[0:43:55] TheDanikay: @swoleMaz yes
[0:43:55] WhiteLotus04: poly is both but 9/10 it’s the girl with multi partners cuz guys typically have less options than girls
[0:44:00] ItsTacticalTaco: Good morning nonnah3Dance
[0:44:00] SpaceOlympix: its an open relationship. you can date others
[0:44:01] hghwalk: I broke up with my ex, her family ended up moving away, she still went to my college. She found me one day when i was walking to my house and got me a taco. It kinda scared me lol
[0:44:05] theonewhoseas: mixing two or more relations into one
[0:44:08] SebasBP28: hi taco nonnah3Dance

[0:44:40] ItsTacticalTaco: @gerocael nonnah3Love
[0:44:49] Sylik16: Hi Taco
[0:44:49] Yolister: acieNOTEPAD
[0:44:56] Sylik16: Taco can you get me a taco?
[0:44:57] swoleMaz: polyamory and polygamy are completely different
[0:45:09] ItsTacticalTaco: Sylik acieWAVE

[0:45:27] ItsTacticalTaco: @sylik16 apeandTaco
[0:45:28] jbt445: she ordered snr buns
[0:45:28] ProNap: Poly: If it between consenting people, it does not concern us. There are many types of poly and the rules are agreed to by the people involved. It certainly is not for everyone
[0:45:32] Nokdsin: snowwwwww

[0:45:51] Phasehero: @nokdsin hhheeeyyyooooo
[0:45:55] Nokdsin: hi luccid
[0:45:58] MeleeGames: some people are only capable of viewing the world through the lens of their personal beliefs and experience. Just because you someone doesn't agree with poly for themselves doesn't mean they need to project that onto the rest of humanity
[0:46:00] WhiteLotus04: guys have to put in more work for multi-partners girls can snap their fingers and have 5 guys over in an hour
[0:46:00] Sylik16: @Acie Poly is a pretty generalized term - it can be purely sexual it can be dating multiple people - they could all be friends they might not know each other
[0:46:02] Nokdsin: @missknightx hi hi hi
[0:46:03] hghwalk: Pronap is correct
