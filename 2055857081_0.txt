[3:25:44] Suvaacc: its not even about late, i think its just the way julian introduced himself to AK, it felt too forced to him, just first impressions havent been good for AK i think
[3:25:44] Chriss332211: now julian is getting a key he will see AK more so might be easier to make a bond with him
[3:25:46] HuffsJenkem: them getting robbed is fully on themselves KEKW
