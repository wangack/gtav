[0:33:32] kaisnipplez: the take is so deranged, bro has never worked a real job
[0:33:37] SunGodIX: yeah thats real asf
[0:33:37] That_1_chick: probably cuz he talks politics and argues with chat every 5 seconds

[0:34:25] Myth_of_Sisyphus: I think it is apparent this is an entirely individualized experience and generalizing is just wrong
[0:34:29] 15moo: streaming is hard you have to sit at a chair and watch videos and talk to people and get paid 7 - 8 figures
[0:34:31] bigbill2137: streaming is probably mentally draining I would imagine
[0:34:31] 15moo: i'd be miserable!

[2:12:48] uros_1998: Bro chat stop feeding Martys head with bs, Lang is ok with Marty, he wants memebers to their shit that they think are the best, thats why he said he doesn't get involved, he lets people do it
[2:12:54] Dilgi_: jp Sadge

[2:13:19] cheshire150: I know gigi and lucy really do care about marty and larry
[2:13:22] netsuJS: @ShahinOv 200k in the bank = poor
[2:13:24] h0teltrivago: I still think the only reason they got Marty in was to rub it in jps face during the company war
[2:13:31] heeeeeeeerr: marty guy ReallyMad
[2:13:36] ShahinOv: @netsuJS no crypto = poor
[2:13:37] Corzappy2: @astyrix_ Gayge Their love is inseparable.

[2:13:55] thumphah: they probably don’t want to kick him out and would rather he leaves on his own
[2:13:58] juneOT: marty is a 1 man army
[2:13:58] Disihe211: Marty is clearly not a good fit for the group and that’s ok just kick him out stop stringing him along
[2:13:59] SxintTrill: mhm but omieSussy
[2:14:08] coldanddistant: facts

[2:14:10] jayyyknee: Didn't help jp lied on your name big time with the whole problem
[2:14:10] 38antsy: self GLAZING
[2:14:15] kurukukurin: i think ppl don’t want to trust someone who shot their best friend
[2:14:15] danushaaaaaa: just talk
[2:14:19] Kitsoooooooo: self glazing but I agree
[2:14:19] pokerspace: Totally undervalued
[2:14:19] hayaboosaa: Marty Yuno Larry & Octo should be the best team in the city @omie
[2:14:20] brikbeans: You are probably the best FLex pick in NA and EU
[2:14:22] indyfaria: just talk no?
[2:14:22] idontlikebeans69: yeah they are wasting Marty’s potential
[2:14:23] ty_136: @somniquil i think ze is on his way home
[2:14:25] Corzappy2: @sighfye Watching it from JP's perspective was insane. Marty says "Talk to Lang" Lang says "Talk to Marty"
[2:14:26] okayelektro: cause youre tied with JP lol
[2:14:28] cozywarrior: @franciscooo25 nope
[2:14:30] simon_lob: ReallyMad this marty guy
[2:14:31] ImNateFr: Ur like wemby on the spurs

[2:14:34] Disihe211: 4Head just talk
[2:14:34] taxism: goals don't align
[2:14:36] jackiewack: They don't value marty. He brings so much and they keep turning down all his plans.
[2:14:36] thumphah: I think the issue is because they have Yuno as hacker they feel they don’t need Marty
[2:14:39] Messagge: then bring it up.
[2:14:44] selfesteamer: show him your farm? i think he would be really impressed
[2:14:46] brikbeans: my dude switched to lumber and save alot of people days
[2:14:47] indyfaria: @thumphah that’s not it
[2:14:47] franciscooo25: @cozywarrior Who insted?
[2:14:48] sh4gun: Just start your own shit they wouldnt even know because they dont care to ask what you are up to KEKW
[2:14:49] JeenYuhsChris: yups
[2:14:50] thumphah: they’re keeping Marty on the backseat till yuno leaves the city
[2:14:50] ョヨョ: :p

[2:14:56] rs_xspartacus: @kurukukurin dont trust the man who shot his best friend for their safety right
[2:14:57] SxintTrill: car sounds like nfs pretty dope
[2:14:57] Light1stNight: i think lang still believes marty only works with jp stil
[2:14:58] selfesteamer: kick flip
[2:15:03] Ninomane: WickedSteer
[2:15:04] JoeKsova: let’s interview some new people for the casino
[2:15:07] wyyndia: "bring it up" you know damn well what happens to marty if he does OMEGALUL
[2:15:09] PatientZeroPoint5: Maybe the lone wolf status makes them question martys loyalty
[2:15:10] TARGETDOTCOM: it doesnt help that fact that if marty does try to speak abt this lang will tell him hes not 'hand-holding' and shit
[2:15:15] tanderson119: didnt you talk to tonish about the casino?
[2:15:17] fancycaat: marty finding new people in the city to work for him or with him sounds fun, fresh faces and new friends
[2:15:23] indyfaria: @wyyndia I mean better than not yk
[2:15:24] JMaker24: blame it on the night type shit don’t blame it on me
[2:15:25] AyoMIXES: they haven’t fucked with a single good idea that you’ve brought up
[2:15:28] sighfye: @Corzappy2 Yeh it was crazy from Buddhas perspective as well, I think he just wants Marty to ...well let me not spoil.
[2:15:31] Lxium: when u play marty r u really a character or just yourself

[2:15:36] fillemite: @thumphah theyll need 2 hackers down the line tho
[2:15:42] brikbeans: @PatientZeroPoint5 like if you are nice to everyone you treat no one special type beat
[2:15:49] Disihe211: JP was right in this single single thing this group doesn’t have his back at all

[2:16:19] JoeKsova: they’re keeping Marty on the backseat till yuno leaves the city
[2:16:23] Corzappy2: @sighfye The miscommunication was mind numbing though like JP could not figure out how to say "Tell Marty that it's not your issue"
[2:16:23] k0pite: bro has said "Marty" multiple times
[2:16:25] ShahinOv: why the heck 7tv stopped workin

[2:17:09] franciscooo25: I doubt you are gonna get money LOL
[2:17:10] oryeezy: Did you ask luci about any nominees?
[2:17:12] brikbeans: if they can extend resources as a small risk investment thats how it was pitched
[2:17:12] TouchFlick: @omie When are you going to apply to the PD?
