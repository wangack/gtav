[6:12:23] mittensduck73: ahhh thank you winter
[6:12:26] didgereederek: makes for good rp
[6:12:39] FilzG: they should promote Rhodes to senior so he can apply to Comissioner and win and take the PD to victory

[6:13:24] FilzG: @wintersoldier2712 I didnt watch 3.0
[6:13:48] FilzG: just saying Rhodes is one of the best voices in the PD
[6:13:51] wintersoldier2712: But Beric yesterday said he might throw his hat in for it
[6:14:01] KristoferYee: your rp earlier in the cells was hilarious good shit curvy
[6:14:03] FilzG: @wintersoldier2712 Beric would be good
[6:14:11] FilzG: Mcnulty is the best option atm ngl
[6:14:14] wintersoldier2712: @FilzG He is yes but basically he never made it out of pd even as a sgt
[6:14:35] wintersoldier2712: @FilzG 1 Tree Tree
[6:14:40] dinoroaria: $400,000
[6:14:59] jonondiscord: mittens. meh.
[6:15:00] FilzG: slacks lowkkey wants to be demoted

[6:15:05] jonondiscord: a little
[6:15:13] FilzG: @wintersoldier2712 yeah Ruby too
[6:15:21] mittensduck73: curvyeHug oh jon
[6:15:24] FilzG: or DeRolo Kappa
[6:15:27] Gachiguru: Now they do if after firing cornwood LULW
[6:15:31] FilzG: or Jackson Kappa
[6:15:31] wintersoldier2712: @FilzG Oh yeah hes said many times. He dont want to be pd. wants to go cg
[6:15:32] jonondiscord: stomach is kind of fucked still

[6:15:54] FilzG: imagine derolo
[6:15:57] FilzG: holy shit
[6:16:07] FilzG: Denzel would get 10 daps doing the academy
[6:16:18] wintersoldier2712: @Gachiguru Oh the mayor already said cornwood would be rehired. Cornwood still wants little texas
[6:16:30] JordxnFair: Kris joysticLOVE
[6:16:35] FilzG: https://clips.twitch.tv/LuckyCooperativeFerretOSsloth-YfW6IFbYx8cA_Tym
[6:16:41] Gachiguru: @wintersoldier2712 The captains are not going to want to work with him; he needs his own thing to prove the current system isnt working.
[6:16:42] wintersoldier2712: Denzel got daps for things others have done and not gotten daps for
[6:16:57] FilzG: check out that clip guys tell me what u think
[6:16:57] captain_steve_420: If Jackson or DeRollo gets Comissioner, then Ruth will just get more power bc they'll just act in her best interest
[6:17:24] mittensduck73: if it is meta put it in the meta channel in discord
[6:17:28] Tambooob: curvyeSip
[6:17:32] FilzG: its. not meta i dont think
[6:17:33] Tambooob: curvyeGun
[6:17:37] eotaw: curvyePhone Ben?
[6:17:39] FilzG: it was in full view
[6:17:45] FilzG: for the whole meeting
[6:17:53] Tambooob: It's meta if the streamer doesn't know about it.
[6:18:00] wintersoldier2712: @Gachiguru Oh they are 99% firing cornwood but if little texas opens up the mayor wants cornwood there
[6:18:07] foxylady48: @captain_steve_420 I said this yesterday
[6:18:08] FilzG: officers didnt see the legistalation?
[6:18:21] wintersoldier2712: @FilzG which part?
[6:18:30] FilzG: the one in the clip
[6:18:39] RhiaAndTheMoon: Rhodes hasn't seen it/read it hence it's meta
[6:18:41] Tambooob: It's best not to assume what has and hasn't been seen NODDERS Especially with implications.
[6:18:51] FilzG: @RhiaAndTheMoon oh ok, my bad then sorry
[6:19:00] mittensduck73: curvyeShrug idk but we always assume rhodes hasnt seen shit till he says it or seens it live
[6:19:09] RhiaAndTheMoon: like Tam said, always best to assume he hasn't seen it
[6:19:10] mittensduck73: *sees
[6:19:28] wintersoldier2712: @FilzG ah so the mayor can fire the cpts ect
[6:19:39] captain_steve_420: @wintersoldier2712 yup
[6:19:47] FilzG: @wintersoldier2712 he can override the power
[6:19:50] foxylady48: @wintersoldier2712 he can take there badges yes
[6:19:57] FilzG: serious question why tf isnt rhodes senior yet?
[6:20:21] wintersoldier2712: Bet. Would be so good to see him fix the pd in a few days
[6:20:26] FilzG: or not being considered even
[6:20:28] eotaw: Rhodes is old guard. They dont like old guard Sadge
[6:20:35] Gachiguru: It only took Cornwood getting fired for the captains to start doing shit OMEGALUL and they still havent reimbursed him
[6:20:36] FilzG: thats gonna change
