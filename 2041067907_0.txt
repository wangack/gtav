[15:51:10] TEAC0DE: @Ray__C  in coding Void means there is no data
[15:51:10] felixyo: I believe its about the amount of assets placed. So it would probably be smart to also create a room for the second floor with all the rooms.
[15:51:10] ChozenV2: THERE ARE ONLY 2 OPTIONS AND NEITHER WORK. THAT MAKE RAY STUPID?
[15:51:10] JooshWasTaken: yeah void link would be the main front door room cuz that loads when you get nearby the house... the other rooms will only load in when you're in an adjacent room
[15:51:11] rxt_raid: hop the fence
[15:51:12] itsVeve: the arrow show what are the room can be connected to, you only made 1 room so far so there is no other option other than void link

[15:51:50] aimsbadsoirun: TOTAL GUESS: Rooms = what gets loaded when accessed. Void Link = removes that rule and forces those objects to load no matter where you are in the house (aka youd want a door to spawn no matter what)

[15:51:54] Moocow11111: IT ROOM OUTLINES
[15:51:55] hate_antichrist: yeah probably

[15:52:50] ABdeR111: is this new house decoration update? @Ray__C
[15:52:51] resarFelyK: I think it works differently
[15:52:52] trekkky: LMFAO
[15:52:52] JooshWasTaken: @Ray__C i think everything is default a void link until you create and link it to other rooms
[15:52:52] nightosphere0: Wokege
[15:52:53] GreedyGrayson: OTT IS WAITING
[15:52:54] QunKe: Skateparkge well the more I think about it the easier it'll be trust....
[15:52:55] Yimmak: @Ray__C Don't link yet. Create the other basement room then link the two. When you walk into the first part of the basement it will load the lab
[15:52:55] graxas: you cropped part of the desk  and floor out of the room, its going to render even if your out of the room.
[15:52:55] papagonsa: only part of it
[15:52:56] aro_1995: its the light?
[15:52:57] ykikooo: Wokege
[15:52:57] itsKiruki: If you can visibly see the room it will load it
[15:52:59] resarFelyK: like the green diamond thing to access doesnt show
[15:53:00] MrGoatsy: i am raycBlind
[15:53:00] tidyee: Go out maybe
[15:53:00] GordoGonk: @Ray__C i think the color coding is just there so its easier to keep track when you have many rooms
[15:53:01] MrGoatsy: lol
[15:53:02] dan_1314: this is just confusing lol
[15:53:04] wraith4m: @Ray__C, best bet is to try it with the top floor
[15:53:04] MightyJaime: will that disrupt the butcoin mining though??
[15:53:05] JooshWasTaken: @Ray__C you need to make the main basement room now
[15:53:05] directcherry: I think it defaults to void link if it has no rooms linked @ray__c
[15:53:06] Drakoncheto_: @Ray__C DUMMY+LAB are void linked RN
[15:53:06] squidlips690: hopefully it still mines
[15:53:06] ruby_shot: u can see models but there not loaded to the point of use
[15:53:07] Konkwistador_1002: @Ray__C make more rooms for each floor 󠀀
[15:53:07] Ben_Kaizer: test it
[15:53:08] AshtxnTV: you didnt make it void
[15:53:10] zxxuk: Five minutes he said
[15:53:10] Pure36: @ray__c do that
[15:53:10] 马克斯: just test it
[15:53:11] JooshWasTaken: @Ray__C i think everything is default a void link until you create and link it to other rooms
[15:53:11] x1juzzous: DEVS DinkDonk
[15:53:11] Sh4rkill3r: the corridor need to be a room that link with the lag @Ray__C
[15:53:12] tonljr: void link first floor
[15:53:12] codemonkeyjuan: its a range @Ray__C if you get close you render it
[15:53:13] Bl1ndracer007: rip ott @Ray__C
[15:53:13] erro_rek: Make other rooms
[15:53:14] mak_mashuu: can you ask a dev to be sure XD
[15:53:14] Camcia: yeah, ask Cyd she made that system
[15:53:15] Iamthesupport420: RAY  DEAR DEV   RAY  DEAR DEV   RAY  DEAR DEV   RAY  DEAR DEV   RAY  DEAR DEV   RAY  DEAR DEV   RAY  DEAR DEV   RAY  DEAR DEV   RAY  DEAR DEV   RAY  DEAR DEV   RAY  DEAR DEV   RAY  DEAR DEV   RAY  DEAR DEV
[15:53:16] NerdStrafe: can u make a second room so it is more clear
[15:53:19] aro_1995: They need tutorial for this
[15:53:19] HyperNoxious: Maybe everything you can see is "rendered" but its not "active" until you enter the area? @Ray__C
[15:53:20] dzvma: there should be some kind of manual to this decoration mode
[15:53:22] x1juzzous: dinkDonk DEVS
[15:53:22] squidlips690: will it still mine but?
[15:53:23] graxas: put the full desk insede the room and test it.
[15:53:23] MightyJaime: will that disrupt the butcoin mining though?? 󠀀
[15:53:23] rdkni: green is on red is off LULW 󠀀
[15:53:23] EsbrohBaby: would carmella know didnt she do house stuff?
[15:53:25] degree_twitch: Devs will probably update everyone on it because of the house headpops
[15:53:27] TEAC0DE: yeah
[15:53:28] corporateslackr: @Ray__C maybe its just "showing the items" and they arent causing lag just the textures get what i mean?
[15:53:29] resarFelyK: look at the thing as you get closer when it renders in the green diamond thing to show you can access it with E shows up
[15:53:30] Oozy24: what about cyd @ray__c
[15:53:33] Drakoncheto_: @Ray__C DUMMY to LAB are void linked RN
[15:53:34] GotAnyMilk_: maybe ask  dev for help with the whole house
[15:53:35] aimsbadsoirun: red and green represents inside and outside of the "room"
[15:53:36] toxic_smit: if u do this for all rooms then your good
[15:53:37] AshtxnTV: void is what stops it from being loaded when you're not in a room
[15:53:38] Moocow11111: Nah you didnt just leave the void link on and drive around the block
[15:53:39] AwanAug: OTT Staring
[15:53:39] JooshWasTaken: yess
[15:53:41] LOLolsen: I think when you enter a room it loads the rooms that are adjacent
[15:53:41] neroo_0: "ott just give me 10 seconds"
[15:53:42] Sh4rkill3r: the corridor need to be a room that link with the lab @Ray__C
[15:53:42] Camcia: cyd and marty know how it works @Ray__C
[15:53:43] Konkwistador_1002: @Ray__C you need to make more rooms for each floor and void link only the floor with the front door
[15:53:43] RocketHerman: If you have loaded it already you might have to leave far away for it to need to load again
[15:53:43] fahd_g: maybe it’s already rendered when you got in first try taking a drive so unrenders then come back to se if it still lags
[15:53:45] Yimmak: Yessss
[15:53:46] h14h: only the first floor need to be voided so no1 will fall to the secret room @Ray__C
[15:53:46] papagonsa: PogU fixed for now
[15:53:48] GAMANTAKA: i think you wanna voidlink
[15:53:50] KayleaForsyth: red looks like you’re outside of that room and green means you’re inside
[15:53:51] tidyee: Maybe try on small room first??
[15:53:52] Nultez: @Ray__C you can visually see it but it does not load like you cant see the interact buttons when outside, also it doesn't have to be perfect cause you are not gonna see it

[15:54:06] thisisfaton: what is this basement rp LUL
[15:54:07] bigd0ngdave69x: Maybe the desk clips out of the room so it renders?

[15:55:00] Broyys: @Ray__C im pretty sure the way you have it set up right now isnt doing anything.You need to set up the rest of the house as a room and then void link that, so everything but the lab loads when you enter the house from outside. The description the void link suggests that void should be the room that is first loaded when you enter the house (eg, everything but the basement).

[15:57:16] aro_1995: run far away to check?
[15:57:16] Sikaan: you could put even more rooms like that if its still lagging so should be fixable

[16:05:27] Yimmak: Don't link them all. It needs to be progressive. So link 2nd floor to bench. then bench to lab.
[16:05:28] coa_1: it might load all of it if its linked

[16:05:29] aro_1995: run farther Rat
[16:05:30] astarothisback: 2nd floor ceiling was too high
[16:05:30] JooshWasTaken: @Ray__C now you need to make a top floor room then link that to both the 2nd floor and void
[16:05:31] behemoth1353: linking loads everything?
[16:05:32] Joffa: maybe try not linking anything
[16:05:33] Konkwistador_1002: no point linking them
[16:05:35] Keyz3r_1: yeah but no point having all rooms linked that just defeats the purpose
[16:05:35] ninja_val: waste
[16:05:35] felixyo: It will load all linked rooms at the same time, thats why you dont want to link them
[16:05:35] GAMANTAKA: @reee_d u dont understand it

[16:05:39] VictoriaKFC: @defonicx BibleThump
[16:05:40] GordoGonk: i think it kinda matters because it will still load them all at once @Ray__C instead of in order
[16:05:40] itsKiruki: Maybe add a first floor that's void linked for the entrance? which then links to 2nd floor
[16:05:42] JooshWasTaken: @@Ray__C now you need to make a top floor room then link that to both the 2nd floor and void is my theory
