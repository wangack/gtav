[0:56:54] FenriusRazgriz: Troglodyte is one of my favorite insults, especially since I know we think of the same example of one
[0:57:02] Brewserker: whups, wrong person, sorry

[0:58:47] xMistressMayhem: yeah?
[0:58:51] dxnielll8233: Mhmm
[0:58:51] Brewserker: start blastin'
[0:59:02] JediJacob_: if they sneak up behind you then its kinda gg
[0:59:03] WhosHumble: more than one person with guns = hands up imo
[0:59:03] tyrant_hades07: Hiiiii
[0:59:04] SimplyOrt: are they approaching with gun too tho?
[0:59:05] duncjw: so I started shooting
[0:59:06] Ebonhawke7: shoot first ask questions later
[0:59:15] SimplyOrt: then its a standoff
[0:59:19] dxnielll8233: Don't speak, just shoot them - We'll deal with consequences later
[0:59:25] VSDuck: ur kinda fucked if they have guns
[0:59:28] skinnylegend000: if they came up with a knife would you change your opinion
[0:59:33] Estidal: Immediately gun then down, then shoot them 20 more times
[0:59:33] DatDudeJakeC: I mean, you aren't technically shooting out a "window" of a PD vehicle.  Light em up
[0:59:33] xMistressMayhem: One person standoff, 2 then we hands up IMO
[0:59:37] Nightbot: Come join the discord and fill up the ranks! https://discord.gg/PMrxK3F
[0:59:38] firefighters52299: How many are in the car?
[0:59:38] Danjor787: say somthing really confusing to defuse the situation
[0:59:48] JediJacob_: @xMistressMayhem this
[1:00:10] BooksBlanketsandTea: depends on whether they have a gun or a knife. If it's a knife, you're gucci. If it's a gun, you can either say that you have your gun out and tell them to put their weapon away (which will likely lead to a shoot out) or you can stick your hands up. I think it'll be situation based, honestly.
[1:00:14] xMistressMayhem: IIRC You have panic button for this also?
[1:00:16] duncjw: say Does ya mum know you have her car ?
[1:00:18] SimplyOrt: if they come with a knife duh, but if they roll up with guns on you its fucked
[1:00:20] BooksBlanketsandTea: essaying <- me, answering a basic question
[1:00:25] firefighters52299: Then o7 hands up
[1:00:28] Dfchurch: I personally wouldnt say a word. as soon as they spoke id fire. they would be expecting it and all they are focused on is speaking. in that situation there is no talk, just instict
[1:00:39] tyrant_hades07: That works üòÇ
[1:00:45] hoanzlgoas: cornwood
[1:00:49] hoanzlgoas: get him
[1:00:59] FenriusRazgriz: Just say an acorn dropped on their car
[1:01:17] LukeVonBismarck: I think HellDivers has trained me to never waste ammo ever again
[1:01:18] Asmodean01: At this point people should expect cops to be on edge and have guns in laps so to say while solo
[1:01:26] straysinger_music: feel like it depends on if they're pointing or not. cause like if the gun's already on you you're probably not beating them to the trigger
[1:01:29] Asmodean01: At least with the past few days
[1:01:54] Estidal: Gun out by their side, I'd at least pull on them. Gun out pointed at you? Hands up.
[1:02:19] Lucsvm: wtf ?
[1:02:20] miwangiches: how‚Äôs the new commissioner doing ltcustDab

[3:09:49] AfroAltruism: its okay cant get em all :)
[3:09:51] DMB429: a normal chase = cops auto win cuz of car diff
[3:09:55] shifu414: @xolision it was a lot of crypto which takes days to mine
[3:10:03] Subparcereal: @xolision the rewards from crims is very bad rn.
[3:10:04] steve_more: @Africannibal This - but wow, next time they will just chase lol payout was ass

[3:10:32] WhosHumble: its interesting too see how people think of the 'interceptors' vs how the PD see them
[3:10:33] PlethoraOfBees: Hey chat, if you say how much it cost to do the job, how much the gained/lost doing the job. That's meta and you should stop OK

[4:01:23] themanwithanrx7: this is gonna be something wild
[4:01:24] skinnylegend000: Ruby as a leader is likely thinking from the officers perspective of constantly being talked to over the same issue.. bones is thinking from his perspective as needing closure on the issue for himself.
[4:01:25] judge_hat: I think its still bugged
[4:01:35] Onntra: images aren‚Äôt working rn

[5:15:31] Aitchemdee: Yeah snow was giving his input yesterday its max speed was like 80 so they are for sure tuning it @Lt_Custard
[5:15:34] KlNNS: idk if you can turbo a bike tbh
[5:15:39] LilMaGooby: Turbos don't do anything on this bike
[5:15:41] Xierany: @Xhrcis1552 On a bike it's lethal yes, because vehicles are lethal
[5:15:45] jmoriarty013: am i hearing rawstyle lol
[5:15:46] Jagyth: ltcustPOLICE ltcustPOLICE ltcustPOLICE
[5:15:50] JediJacob_: im surprised you didn't get shot in the tunne;s
[5:15:51] gateloz: true
[5:16:10] Angel_ofMercy: Its sad that turbos dont help with the speed either
[5:16:16] 2kvcgoat: the bike they used goes 100
[5:16:20] ifinessedyomom: Best bike chase we've seen so far
[5:16:21] tobs74: those spikes at the tunnel exit were on point
[5:16:30] wolfeyes916: cadet held their own
[5:16:35] JediJacob_: she drove very well though by herself and kept comms on a bike
[5:16:35] xMistressMayhem: Indeed it was either abbandon them or lose em
[5:16:36] Jagyth: Plus she seemed to pretty well and keeping in on the chase solo.
[5:16:41] gateloz: @Angel_ofMercy lower grade turbos only help accel. the 99's help top speed I think. it gives 20-40mph
[5:16:42] Aitchemdee: spike was perfect slow speed
[5:16:44] xMistressMayhem: that spike was on Point
[5:16:49] Xhrcis1552: @SOG_JediJacob i think that was his fear too.. he said he wasnt comfortable with it in the tunnel. but you are valid
[5:16:52] MahshieMayhem: We hear you asking for 15 to 20 buuuuut best we can do is 7 to 10 Kappa

[5:17:11] xMistressMayhem: @MahshieMayhem more like tree fiddy
[5:17:31] KlNNS: i think you have to look through the eyes to pull a gun on a bike
[5:17:44] Aitchemdee: Anyway great chase xqcL
[5:17:44] KlNNS: ohh
[5:17:47] Jagyth: This reminds of that one movie...
[5:17:54] vechtera: like pistol whip someone from the bike NODDERS

[5:22:02] gateloz: Think the mechanics said that 99 turbos are the size of a bike's engine.. so they don't work? devs prob don't want bikes going too fast
[5:22:03] DawnMarie: This sounds like a female Lenny LuL
[5:22:05] xMistressMayhem: Cadet sounds confident

[5:23:45] PirateKing1600: when it comes to nvl where is the line for the argument to fight for your life? like if you get held up I know you put your hands up but if you know your options are to die like in the bridge bandit scenario is there not an argument to try and punch the dude or nightstick them or something?
[5:24:03] Jagyth: It was pretty funny, especially with the absolute bike chaos that was going on.
[5:24:46] AloofMango: interesting question foheadTHINKING
[5:25:01] CopperKat: I think the issue is that the rule itself is more nuanced than 'not valuing life', it's sort of misnamed which leads to bad conclusions from chat

[6:26:45] smboulet: I work as a stage hand. It's just a warning for people who try to use the same channel on two different mics. They all should be available for your use
[6:26:47] spuds3432: You need to get the mic the sham-wow guy has AAAA
[6:26:58] AlistairUK: So .... take the dumb approach and get a decent plug and play one since its for limited use.
