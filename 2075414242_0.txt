[1:14:11] DarkScarletMage: Zero Mission best starting point
[1:14:18] CthulhuPandaGames: Fusion was my first Metroid game and I hated it at the time. I love it now that I've played the others.
[1:14:38] 91xex: I got into playing the time splitter series never played it before it’s great stuff!
[1:14:43] dangolanford_: Fusion is creepy
[1:14:43] Kahzel: the SA-X scared the shit out of child me lmao
[1:14:44] kyulen742: like the old Sonic games where you fight Eggman at the end of every level nodd
[1:14:47] Winternova23: It nailed the creep factor
[1:14:49] HanayomeK: Prime scared me when I was younger but like...certainly old enough that I...shouldn't have been scared by it lol
[1:14:49] omega_notverse_lizardlol: it was alien isolation before its time
[1:14:51] EntropicCow: Super Metroid was my first metroid game. Dread was my 2nd. am I a bad person?
[1:14:53] ProfessorSapling: geegaHappy dimaaWave
[1:14:54] cadianlord1: i remember playing the original metroid in the early 90s

[1:15:26] EntropicCow: I was hearing that beeping in my nightmares for a while.
[1:15:30] Shad0w_wizard: it's not a game but Scooby Doo on zombie Island scared the shit out of me and is the reason I like zombie games/movies
[1:15:31] AdalarStormheart: what game?
[1:15:34] CrueltyFreeViking: Dread was so good
[1:15:34] GangplankTheKing: dredd really amped the thriller aspects up
[1:15:36] leshnator: monkaW EMMI
[1:15:45] DrKarate_: ngl, I thought the robot fights were the worst part of dread, they got less scary and just annoying after a while
[1:15:52] AdalarStormheart: ohhhh, metroid, got it
[1:16:06] Winternova23: And we're getting Prime 4 someday
[1:16:12] Kahzel: prime 3 handled the pressure of "corruption" really well
[1:16:13] EntropicCow: I intend to get the prime remaster at some point.
[1:16:15] CrueltyFreeViking: CEASE FUCK IT WE'RE PLAYIN EM ALL

[1:16:28] EvisceratingAxe: Was fusion on the GBA? I remember really liking one of them.
[1:16:34] DarkScarletMage: then prime happened
[1:16:34] CrueltyFreeViking: More influence from alien than love craft
[1:16:41] Winternova23: It's Alien
[1:16:42] maleficscholar: not an existential threat
[1:16:43] snoopingasu: " Buhh oh das a parasite"
[1:16:44] Gonkish: Metroid is closer to, like, Alien... where it's like "these things are freaky and weird and VERY not happy with you"
[1:16:47] OuijaBat: Almost like not Lovecraftian
[1:16:47] stachystat: @EvisceratingAxe yeah fusion was GBA
[1:16:49] leshnator: I love how in Metroid Prime 1 you have to piece together the story yourself through the lore and log scans
[1:16:51] EvisceratingAxe: @lederpington yes, and captain blasto
[1:16:54] Kahzel: @EvisceratingAxe zero mission and fusion were gba games, yes

[1:17:10] AgentTalin: it took me 3 hours to open the first door on prime 3
[1:17:14] LeDerpington: @EvisceratingAxe one day there will be a tiny tank remaster
[1:17:15] bursky00: It's mostly scifi than scifi fantasy, so it doesn't really have cosmic horror in it.
[1:17:15] doodoosh_t: do you have a favorite metroid type game that is more recent? Grime was pretty good
[1:17:17] Shad0w_wizard: do you like space geega?
[1:17:20] Tapeman83: the Wii controller is objectively the best controller for Metroid because of the free aim, I will die on this hill
[1:17:21] AlexHasTacos: might have to dig up my gamecube to play echoes again
[1:17:24] Winternova23: Grounded

[1:18:05] EggyBaleada: Just toss that zesty jellyfish in the freezer
[1:18:09] NODZZ: can't wait for Prime 4 to never come out (but im stoked the OG Prime studio is working on it)
[1:18:09] darthketojan: want to get Metroid full story read the mange never came out us yet
[1:18:11] MetalGlow: i thought metroid was the robot dude
[1:18:12] Piperken: many many many little things >.<
[1:18:17] TobilTop: Very few games get me to try the more difficult mechanics but Dread had me trying to 100% it with all the boost and ball and jump tricks
[1:18:17] bursky00: Now play other M for the full metroid experience.
[1:18:18] EvisceratingAxe: @lederpington We can only hope
[1:18:22] stachystat: war of the worlds, mars lost to bacteria
[1:18:25] AdalarStormheart: like the flood?
[1:18:32] shadowwolfpackleader: Almost like the flood from the halo games

[1:18:58] DarkScarletMage: mother brain meiyaSip
[1:18:59] retrogamer_Leo: yeah, they were engineered to be weak to cold if I'm not mistaken, thats how Samus usually deal with them
[1:19:04] Shad0w_wizard: Aware
[1:19:04] cowdrey7: RIZZ samus zero suit
[1:19:05] snoopingasu: why can't metroid crawl MobMeeting
[1:19:06] EntropicCow: nest you'll tell me the green guy isn't Zelda
[1:19:06] kyulen742: eatt
[1:19:10] NODZZ: lmao, except Metroids are more like an invasive species than something like the flood
[1:19:11] darthketojan: you might need to show them boss
[1:19:14] Jingosu: my metroid plushie is very smool and adorable NODDERS
[1:19:14] odeeeee: Did you ever play Zero mission?

[1:19:20] DrKarate_: what was the joke when it came out on virtual console? "Why cant metroid crouch!?"
[1:19:21] Jam_Plays_Games: it’s like if the Mario series was named Goomba
[1:19:32] NODZZ: sequence breaking in the primes was great
[1:19:32] elpeenz: Lots of kids thought that when it came out if they didn't read the instruction manuals. Same with Zelda/Link
[1:19:35] leshnator: Oh, yeah, they went hard with the Shinespark puzzles
[1:19:37] DarkScarletMage: knutsWave have good stream

[1:20:03] Drearysun: shinesparks Sludge
[1:20:04] Winternova23: Unfortunately, there's Other M which is a worse version of Fusion's story
[1:20:06] Shibato7: no equipment geegaPunch1 geegaPunch2  no problem
[1:20:10] Gonkish: yeah Samus is like "oh you thought stealing my stuff would make me less deadly? Yeah no I'm a badass space bounty hunter"
[1:20:12] kyulen742: it's like the meme of people thinking the Master Chief is named Halo LUL
[1:20:13] NODZZ: just MG people down with the power beam
[1:20:16] Bauldyr: Still just as capable, just not as lethal nodd

[3:42:39] CDabmaster: @atlasianpunz yea but the misunderstandings is what makes the rp good and getting invested into, if it was smooth all the time then it's not as interesting getting invested as a viewer. And when they eventually do come to a solution or lack of one, that is what makes the emotions hit harder as well so it's a double edged sword honestly LOL especially if the comms are bad between two characters u like
[3:42:41] sensoRC: but that run is a crew thing with loads of armed guards
