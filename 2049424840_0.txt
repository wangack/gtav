[0:37:27] nobodybodon: @VariantIN Juno doesn't like Lottie
[0:37:28] Jen848: she's bringing up several points
[0:37:42] nobodybodon: IDK how much if at all that played into vitos opinion of her
[0:37:48] Thunis: KEKW
[0:37:52] Icy_Boost: KEKW
[0:37:52] dinoroaria: uh oh
[0:37:57] CatGotYourKeyboard: nakkiKEKS
[0:38:12] nobodybodon: Knowing Juno it might even be Vitos opinion that made Juno dislike Lottie.
[0:38:29] VariantIN: @nobodybodon idk if that's even true but why would there be causality even if Juno does not like her?
[0:38:29] kelpklepto: banana427DANCE

[0:41:30] VariantIN: @nobodybodon People sometimes just don't gel
[0:41:53] retrowolf0498: Vito was basically a blind and deaf captain sailing a sinking ship. Didn't pay attention to anyone's issues and ignored them until it was way too late.
[0:43:06] ciphz: dude do be deflecting hard
[0:43:27] Skyshark333: he needed to solve the issues as they came, in the end, they just piled up too high

[0:45:50] tfw_badfeel: had to click share to get rid of the popup in chat lol, didn't mean to interrupt
[0:46:02] thegrandgeneral3: She seems to be pushing a narrative that certain people planned this out, or at least I think she is?
[0:46:34] jimothy64: @thegrandgeneral3 could be her perception of it, like some people think Eve et al planned everything
[0:47:01] LilMaGooby: @thegrandgeneral3 no, she's pointing out that other people tried to imply she had planned it
[0:47:05] retrowolf0498: The narrative is painting Vito as a pathetic leader and would rather shift all the blame to others than shoulder some of it.

[0:53:20] dinoroaria: Cope, Seethe, Malton MaltonWTongue
[0:53:23] retrowolf0498: To terrified to voice their problems to Vito and Juno in fear for what might happened.
[0:53:41] Thunis: i think selling the house brought the issues back
[0:53:46] Darth_hedgehog: nakkiD
[0:53:47] JoeayIV: imagine if you're Juno and get told you're boyfriend who ignores you 90% of the time is prioritizing you too much
[0:54:00] sonadapop: @JoeayIV LUL
[0:54:03] LilMaGooby: @retrowolf0498 they addressed every issue to vito and he ignored it. This is on Vito, not Juno or anyone else
[0:54:03] molotov_michelle: @thunis agreed
[0:54:06] kyloned: it was a lot more than just juno and lottie from what I understand
[0:54:14] jimothy64: Honestly, I bet Juno wasn't the main issue and it's just Eve and Co sucking at explaining themselves... you know, communication issues and all that again
[0:54:19] Melbort: moon2Y fuck

[0:55:23] jimothy64: @joeayiv can confirm, am British, most swear words and curses sound weird in my accent, the big C is one of the few I consistently use lol
[0:55:34] Zyphamon: @nobodybodon Britain is a weird place. Imagine declaring whole wars over spices and then not using them LUL
[0:55:38] kelpklepto: @voidhorizonz this is what causes 90% of the conflict in most things
[0:55:39] JoeayIV: like lets be honest here
[0:55:50] DJayEnzyme: @Zyphamon why use them when you could sell them and make bank
[0:55:55] JoeayIV: Juno yelling and hurtling insults is tame
[0:55:58] QuesoCommander: so far one of the only things consistent with everyone is that no one was surprised people would be mad after the house was sold
[0:56:02] ciphz: i gotta see how much people put into the house
[0:56:09] rrrake: eve put in over 1/4 of the money herself also here.

[0:56:44] firmgrips: she‚Äôs standing on business, I respect it lol

[0:58:29] voidhorizonz: The mere fact she went down there still speaks volumes tho
[0:58:37] ciphz: rn im just mostly disappointed in vito lol the juno tiny tony and joe stuff going at eve + carlo seems like a symptom of vitos lack of honesty and accountability
[0:58:51] Ramsay101: I mean, they essentially said go give us the money now or else at that point.
[0:59:11] thegrandgeneral3: Did she tell them that?
[0:59:27] shamma656: @thegrandgeneral3 yes
[0:59:29] Jen848: @Ramsay101 I think they felt like if they didn't get money right then, they never would.
[0:59:38] protege00: She did
[0:59:50] thegrandgeneral3: So before going to the bank she told them she sold at a loss?
[0:59:53] voidhorizonz: @ramsay101 i feel so aswell
[0:59:54] salbenzo3: it was an explosive situation
[0:59:54] Anhellzer: money always cause problems even in rp
[0:59:54] jimothy64: The issue is, she sold the house without communication, so the trust was gone
[0:59:56] Anhellzer: :(

[1:01:16] protege00: @Hesback_ I mean, if you're being disrespected like she was by Juno, would you just sit there and take it?
[1:01:21] kyloned: the trust was gone the moment Vito was acting like they didn't just talk for 3 hours @jimothy64

[1:01:40] thegrandgeneral3: @shamma656 I don't think thats right since she sold the house and then got "strong-armed" to the bank, it sounds like she never said anything till after giving Vito 50k.
[1:01:50] Jen848: lol

[1:03:14] Hesback_: @salbenzo3 why would Vito do that, it was over at that point, neither him or Eve were in a leadership position so people can speak their shit
[1:03:27] davelecook: maybe it‚Äôs a angry Italian mama
[1:03:31] JWuwee: What? Tessa would have communicated to the group what was going on? Wow!

[1:06:10] LilMaGooby: Her story matches up perfectly and even calls out what Vito said in his meeting with Tessa. The fact that Vito even told Tessa that there were non existent issues that he didn't know about. It seems like Vito just didn't want to lead, and saw an opportunity to shed any responsibilities

[1:22:08] JoeayIV: it was funny how she brought up talking to Luci
[1:22:12] JoeayIV: that was a good one
[1:22:16] kelpklepto: I wonder how the Luciano + Eve dynamic is gonna be now
[1:22:36] DocAnonyMouse: and Vito leaving without consulting anyone too
[1:23:00] JoeayIV: hell if your intent was to work to pay everyone back
[1:23:01] sagesnojo: @DocAnonyMouse wdym?
[1:23:05] JoeayIV: i wouldn't give myself a cut
[1:23:06] JoeayIV: at all
[1:23:13] JoeayIV: whats the difference
[1:23:15] DocAnonyMouse: also, none of this matters, because I still like turtles
[1:23:23] JoeayIV: i HATE turtles
[1:23:26] ciphz: getting back 40% of the investment was just a kick in the HypeShock
[1:23:32] JoeayIV: they got dumb lookin heads
[1:23:33] DocAnonyMouse: D=
[1:23:42] kelpklepto: i still like using plastic straws, so i guess i hate turtles too
[1:23:46] JoeayIV: they always looks deep in thought when they dumb as hell
[1:23:52] JoeayIV: what they thinkin about
[1:23:53] DocAnonyMouse: but they‚Äôre so cute :‚Äô(((
[1:23:53] jimothy64: If Fifi's numbers yesterday were accurate, they put in 30% of the money but walked away with 60% of the payout..
[1:24:22] QuesoCommander: lots of pride dividing the groups
[1:24:57] JoeayIV: also should have expected Juno to be loud and insulting
[1:25:02] sage40k: nakkiLurker
[1:25:09] DocAnonyMouse: but Eve is a slay businesswoman and Tessa is too much of a sweetheart
[1:25:34] JoeayIV: has the speed limit officially been changed?
[1:25:47] wheatenz: What is Eve's connection to Nino btw?
[1:25:57] sagesnojo: Yes Tessa is a sweetheart but also very wise
[1:26:10] DocAnonyMouse: @joeayiv no, turtle speed limit has not changed, they‚Äôre still adorably slow
[1:26:22] JoeayIV: sucks to be a turtle
[1:26:23] Kane_of_Bane: She shorted the family like 30k right
[1:26:28] jimothy64: Actually, they walked away with almost 70%, for 30% put in, based on Fifis numbers
[1:26:39] JWuwee: @joeayiv i think it has
[1:26:41] frowardmuffin59: the luiciano thing too
[1:26:47] JWuwee: 55 in city
[1:26:51] sagesnojo: @Kane_of_Bane 230K ish
[1:26:58] JoeayIV: and got upset at Vito for talking to Juno
[1:27:04] CatGotYourKeyboard: NODDERS
[1:27:06] JoeayIV: that is pretty fucking funny
[1:27:06] leydann: pot kettle situation that
[1:27:07] Zubins: She did say she's still willing to pay people back tho if they come talk to her right?
[1:27:20] black_sloth: GIGATESSO
[1:27:22] JoeayIV: and it seems like Vito and Juno didn't even know about that part
[1:27:31] jimothy64: And then grumbled about going to Juno first or Donnie talking outside the family.. pot meet kettle
[1:27:32] JoeayIV: THEY'RE DATING
[1:27:40] JoeayIV: AND HE IGNORES HER 100% OF THE TIME
[1:27:48] CatGotYourKeyboard: Yeah...that's kind of an odd claim. lol
[1:27:57] leydann: @jimothy64 If the 40/40/40 split is right, then iirc Carlo & Fifi actually got more than their original cut
[1:27:59] ciphz: perspective is important
[1:28:07] CatGotYourKeyboard: @ciphz Absolutely.
[1:28:08] JoeayIV: and the fact that they both brought it up like it was some big issue is like
[1:28:28] JoeayIV: if you said that shit to Vito ofc he'd likely to think everything else was a nothing burger or lies
[1:28:44] jimothy64: Yeah, and Carlo and Fifi *never* disappeared from Family activities together... serious hypocrisy
[1:29:07] ciphz: all stems from the lack of communication problem
[1:29:21] JoeayIV: holy shit OMEGALULiguess
[1:29:24] AngryLuigi13: D:
[1:29:26] leydann: Fifi and Carlo are joined at the waist
[1:29:35] kelpklepto: Classic siblings
[1:30:20] IIIIHELLIIII: mehdiPOG
[1:30:33] JoeayIV: or Vito talking with the closest person to Tessa about it
[1:30:37] Jen848: how dare Juno call her man
[1:30:39] jimothy64: Like, it was a meme that Carlo and Fifi ditched everyone to hang out with each other. They even disappeared from Academy together.. so the Juno/Vito thing just feels so hypocritical
[1:31:35] JoeayIV: its so spicy too
[1:31:36] ciphz: juno do be polarizing
[1:31:37] alicekathryn_: I mean Juno isn‚Äôt perfect but she seriously lives rent free in a lot of peoples minds
[1:31:43] sagesnojo: is it me or did the sub goal change?
[1:31:54] JoeayIV: cuz either they have the wrong perception on it, or are lying
[1:31:54] lil_smella: still cant believe this all stems from tessa telling vito she wants to do her own thing
[1:31:58] JoeayIV: or some mix bag
[1:33:02] Regodude: LUL so much chaos
[1:33:21] jimothy64: Also possible the issues weren't as big as Eve and Co thought they were. Hard to say. Whole thing is a spicy complicated mess and everyone's hands are dirty
[1:33:28] JWuwee: So there were 3 leaders , not 1
[1:33:44] IIIIHELLIIII: The subpocalypse hit so the goal got changed @sagesnojo
[1:33:51] Zubins: I thought Eve's role was just an adviser, and thought it wasn't her job to do that stuff
[1:34:06] Melbort: PepeHands How could Tessa do all of this
[1:34:09] JoeayIV: time to find out her bones healed wrong from sleeping in a cot
[1:34:11] JoeayIV: (REAL)
[1:34:15] retrowolf0498: She was a consig. She was an underboss
[1:34:16] Rekonin: Eve was inter-personal communication and problem solving
[1:34:44] sagesnojo: @IIIIHELLIIII oh thanks, i heard about the subpocalypse
[1:35:00] JoeayIV: poach Tiny Tony DESKCHAN
[1:35:17] JWuwee: Natalia would be interesting
[1:35:25] retrowolf0498: Definitely need to poach Tiny
[1:35:27] ciphz: thats kinda cryptic lol. it is nice to talk to her
[1:35:42] retrowolf0498: Or either Tommy
[1:36:01] JWuwee: @ciphz Lottie being cryptic and fishing for information from Tessa üòÜ
[1:36:33] jimothy64: Honestly it was doomed when Eve was promoted to the interpersonal communications position in the midst of failing to communicate with her sister.. like, that was good comms from Vito's perspective.. bad signs all around
[1:37:18] ciphz: it was doomed when someone doing sani had the most money
[1:37:23] Verilol: tender butts are the worst
[1:37:23] JWuwee: But I still need to get it checked
[1:37:55] ciphz: no one else figured out how to contribute more at that point

[7:41:02] xXxEV0xXx: Would be exciting to watch a tournament style for this, first rounds you either move on to next round, or go to hospital. But in the final round, either 1v1 or 1v1v1... winning gets a bunch of cash, or like a hyper car or house or something. And the other finals losers die, and stay dead. lol. Wouldn't want more people then that cause wouldn't want too many permas.
