[0:29:41] Iamalamas: You know they say that all men are created equal, but you look at me and you look at Duncan and you can see that statement is not true. See, normally if you go one on one with another captain, you got a 50/50 chance of winning. But I’m a genetic freak and I’m not normal! So you got a 25%, AT BEST, at beat me. Then you add Ruby York to the mix, your chances of winning drastic go down

[1:01:21] catfish_quackenbush: @Felaryn he was the one that got ocean dumped and refused to forget what happened, so he stayed in the water for like 6 hours until they found him
[1:01:22] anumarduk: is the typing supposed to be him showing text on his phone?
[1:01:24] Deathofcliffy: @Republic_of_texas not sure thats the route, as its an integral part of robbing RP to make sure they cannot contact help, if the situation occurs

[1:01:31] Toastedgamer03: @Wintyer2 again though whatever happens with those situations the outcomes won't actually come today since captains need to meet together
[1:01:46] Topking10: did cornwood get dapped
[1:01:54] SmugPls: He is rping out ocean dump differently because on an OOC level he dislikes the concept and thinks its better to RP out being found but choosing to not remember

[1:02:34] Pandrax86: @Wintyer2 thought knight rescinded his report on that. and honestly cornwood really wasn't involved outside of trying to calm the situation down because theres never leadership on to do it. lol

[1:48:39] brvtyy: 1/3 of the pd is playing game of thrones
[1:48:41] Athbreith: At what point do you just throw your hands up and say fuck it?
[1:48:43] doowhoowdelayheehoo: tell him that all the meetings will still be held in the city that'll sugar him up
[1:48:44] aoc_bae: the pd would be greater with cornwood as Sheriff America
[1:48:44] Brakon: I mean also people are obsessed with the next pd punishment drama
[1:48:45] aniquilattion: @warner05 ew
[1:48:46] notmaxmax: 4 officers talking in circles instead of patrolling LUL
[1:48:47] thebigchinballs: @warner05  nope

[1:48:48] Edward_Theodore: to me cornwood is top 5 cops
[1:48:49] dallkionn: wtf that chat is retarded LUL
[1:48:49] Van_1912: he is a serious character tho
[1:48:49] Cthulink: vote cornwood for mayor
[1:48:49] DiscretionaI: Max is also upset that cadets and applicants aren’t being pushed through the program better too
[1:48:51] JO3Y_C: Its a power trip.. They open the LASO they lose the power simple
[1:48:52] haleyheartt: FIND a way to speak that into this conversation in rp. show him youre still passionate about it.
[1:48:52] 360ski: @im_so_strange it is that way with all the ppl that stream the most and actually do thier job
[1:48:52] Wallsh_: @DaltonIRL his chat gets locked more than any others ive seen
[1:48:53] ultimategamersan: ruth is stiring from what I feel from this
[1:48:53] JoeSizzle7: Making a suggestion though doesn't mean others have to push the idea
[1:48:54] HibikiHikariVT: @warner05 they would be fired so fast if even accepted at all

[1:49:00] ajay311: U doing great esfand keep grinding my dude
[1:49:01] WHATtheINTERROBANG: YEP @EsfandTV but these captain are seemingly unable to  make a fucking logical leap in intelligence
[1:49:03] iLigandTV: @ZachFromChat it's so weird over there lmao
[1:49:03] yourhuckIeberry: i mean cornwood main character, but some people have to be and who better than cornwood. but i can  see jealousy/annoyance
[1:49:05] TankArcade: Ruth and Slacks wanna keep only in the city they aint country people
[1:49:07] Berserake: I think its beyond help, they're too stubborn to take any criticism imo
[1:49:10] kuroyasha3: its the illusion they have of big streamer special streamer and not knowing the whole story
[1:49:10] im_so_strange: captains want cops but good rp isn’t just everything irl. there needs to be a little bit of comedy to break things up
[1:49:12] Balabuchi: half of this is all unnecessary drama to water down a story ark
[1:49:12] BohLTss: @itWyrm True
[1:49:13] xnightshift2658: FTO is a pay raise in most places too
[1:49:15] catfish_quackenbush: @thesonofbean not true, but when he mag dumps a criminal, it makes it kind of difficut to be fully behind Cornwood
[1:49:15] ViciousRumor: Little Texas stations should operate as a funnel for new recruits to learn and train to eventually move down to LSPD, there's less crime up there so it makes sense
[1:49:15] Azzghan: shoud FTO remove daps?
[1:49:18] thefakeazn: what is FTO
[1:49:19] LHaxorP: @EsfandTV, It Happens IRL all the time... people who push for change gets weird backlash for it from multiple diff factions who dont want it or only want it thier way

[1:51:14] Shmoopee: it's too shiny
[1:51:15] Zanduin: Duncan had a bad day of DAPS, went offline hours ago
[1:51:16] TimmayHS: @Istaf_SC that's not always true. A lot of us just want the PD to "win".. but really not win.. we just want the best possible RP
[1:51:18] desktopdummy: special uniform shirt
[1:51:19] agent_wisefool: Dap removals?
[1:51:20] Lucid_Jaydee: make more money while FTOing

[1:51:24] MahanGM: saab is actually really good, but i don't get his angle in 4.0 LULW
[1:51:26] ZachFromChat: New mount for FTO'ing dentt Pog
[1:51:30] kingofthebeats: that doesn't count as FTO, Corn is useless, can't even pit
[1:51:30] inducedcatharsis: But money could do a similar thing to a car, it could make people FTO for a wrong reason
[1:51:32] dains84: the Mayor's office/treasury/Nekoda are supposed to be cooking up something about FTO'ing
[1:51:33] ShadowedSeraphim: @EsfandTV FTO gets more Reimbursed for Repairs?
[1:51:36] MrBASins: I think awareding its great but as long as it don't divided the lspd
[1:51:38] Ragestrike: special FTO labels on the car, and slick tops or something
[1:51:39] Gerald_O: @Pandrax86 huh? no lol
[1:51:39] Karter6t: Give them a Turbo Kappa
[1:51:40] Zenysa: character conflict is just a part of the story guys. Ssaab is still great.

[1:51:42] AngeloJulius: they get to wear hats
[1:51:43] xseaka: @ViciousRumor oh nope im not disagreeing with you, just thought it was funny about the crime level
[1:51:43] slomojosh: they need to fight the burn out though
[1:51:44] SeaOfEmpty: Money is what the counsel said. Moderate bonus for each completed session
[1:51:47] Jrey000: thtat is why you need more FTOs to hire
[1:51:48] slomojosh: like no one is doing shit
[1:51:50] SmugPls: @MahanGM i think his admin desires for the PD are REALLY STRONG in his influence on things
[1:51:52] bbbrabbit123: I think they should limit the hrs of FTOing
[1:52:03] MahanGM: @SmugPls might be
[1:52:07] bubbles_ip: whats fto
[1:52:09] Titantrace1: yes
[1:52:09] greenburg22: truth
[1:52:13] bbbrabbit123: like 6 hrs every weekdays FTOing
[1:52:16] TyleriumGaming: 8 raiders from TyleriumGaming have joined! 
[1:52:17] Pandrax86: @MahanGM Yeah, I enjoy watching his stream but he was also given the keys to the castle in terms of the police in general on the WL. hes the man in charge as admin. even if someone else is Chief of police, hes... still in charge. lol
[1:52:17] RexPappa: I think the captains want to do Police Simulator for 4.0, while the everyone else is playinga GTA5
[1:52:18] 360ski: 3 days paid vacation!
[1:52:19] comato4st: i didnt believe it but they view cornwood like we view duncan lol
[1:52:22] iwannanuhh: @MahanGM True, the captains in 4.0 are brain dead when making leadership decisions
[1:52:23] evilmnkey4: @bubbles_ip Field Training Officer
[1:52:26] itisacar: sup raiders
[1:52:28] TankArcade: @iwannanuhh yeah we know its RP but come on tone it down a bit you make it boring for other cops. Its not like we want Cornwood to win. It just give stress to play
[1:52:29] ItsLucuss: FTO badge on uniform/hat/car would be cool
[1:52:34] Kaseyfullofjoy: @bubbles_ip mentoring basically having a newbie with u and teaching them
[1:52:35] BohLTss: @Pandrax86 literally typing the word ruth makes message insta filtered
[1:52:40] DeoNone: @bbbrabbit123 it's 4 hrs per fto session there ya go

[1:52:43] polyphony620: got to remember they all want a better pd they just have different visions.
[1:52:44] ViciousRumor: @xseaka hmm, maybe I'm just watching the wrong crim streams, I mainly watch Ming and most of his stuff happens in Los Santos
[1:52:44] Istaf_SC: @TimmayHS Yea but I'm saying in general with GTARP. Its the exact same for all streamer's chat. Any time CHARACTERS have a conflict a lot of chatters treat it like it's real.
[1:52:45] chmod_R_777: GIGACHAD too popular
[1:52:48] MahanGM: i agree chatters OKEY

The story trends on Twitter. Esfand turns down talk show appearances. His septic tank fails. People form a cult. His toilet is finished.

[3:23:47] thebigshabam: maybe the devs tuned it when they had 2 ppl testing
[3:23:47] arcticOP: weight distributino?
[3:23:49] MrPersevere: Does Cornwood ped add weird weight mechanics?
[3:23:52] Ross_McD: GO FOR PIT
[3:23:52] Snake_Puffs: helps even the weight out alot of weight on the right side KEKW
[3:23:55] GlitchyByte: i heard from an expert that with a 2nd person there is more weight and has more traction
[3:23:55] LHaxorP: @Esfandtv throw a bunch of shit in the trunk for wieght maybe?
[3:23:55] bullbabear: you could throw some objects in the back to test the weight theory
[3:23:56] KeiKeiNi: Perfect pit
[3:23:58] BohLTss: the toolsetssssssss
[3:23:58] LGHTYRS: ruined
[3:23:58] TombARKerr: You’re going down hill
[3:23:58] Doqx42: try loading it up with barriers
[3:24:03] brinderwalt42: @esfandtv Could you add weight to it with cargo in the back?
[3:24:04] DeoNone: 146
[3:24:04] Acebravo_nz: 149

[3:24:24] decentenuff: No bumps in this game boost your car @esfandtv
[3:24:27] FATHERLESSTTV: its more controlled tho
[3:24:32] decentenuff: Curbs were best for it
[3:24:32] peonthruster: Maybe whatever your using to control is busted
[3:24:33] EastSideBoy651: bumps in the road, air, stuff like that
[3:24:38] JasonVoorhees71: suspension bottoming out makes it go faster weirdly
[3:24:38] striggly_diggly: curb boosting is the springs of your vic compressing and bouncing back to normal, so normal air jumps will give you a slight boost as long as you stick the landing and dont get wobbly
[3:24:39] ChaoticSanity: little more complicated than that
[3:24:41] NickMastaFlex: grabbing air
[3:24:43] nier3030: That's how i also park

[3:24:56] PokeMattTCC: then a lil boost when u labd

[3:26:20] greenburg22: ask at shift meetings
[3:26:21] SumDee_LumDee: SNAKES
[3:26:21] pretzelz_kingz: Sequential means you can only go from 1 to 2 to 3 etc..... you can't skip gears like a standard synchro trans
[3:26:23] Jrey000: the one in aldos car?

[3:26:25] zerzz24: Susge ARCHER PUT IT ON HER BIKE
[3:26:25] Bearcat_77: @EsfandTV Compression of suspension makes car go faster in gtav, this mechanic was so you don't get stuck in the mountains, but the side effect was you could abuse the mechanic anywhere in the game.
[3:26:25] SumDee_LumDee: SNAKES IN THE PD

[4:08:46] Fozenoh: Jamgie
[4:08:47] h4ppyf1sh: dang you're getting good at stealing cars
[4:08:47] w111iam1: Denzel will probably be a by the book character now
[4:08:47] RAMEEKILLEDSAMBAAS: NP has to much RP denying
[4:08:48] CARPExxDiem: Was their a clip of how Esfand sounded before he fixed it?
[4:08:49] PsychoJoker: Andrews getting dapped 5 too inc for egging you on
[4:08:49] sealemons: Just say yes and no to the captain giving the dap... don't give them anything
[4:08:49] heftylefty_prime: Saab has been shitting on chat who counter anything he's saying hard. It's unfortunate. Can't tell if they're being irl stubborn or not anymore.
[4:08:50] claptil: Yeah trying to remove ooc from GTA RP makes no sense
[4:08:50] SmugPls: @Thozel 1 dap for the Knight/aziz memeing because the stories dont match. 5 minimum for killing the 1 life character because of 'excessive force'
[4:08:50] TimmayHS: Nothing beats Cornwood cop RP
[4:08:51] Trevor_x64: give a brief rundown from your perspective pls? im confusion where this started
[4:08:51] Fozenoh: ReallyMad hey I was vibin to that
[4:08:52] DonnieRockettt: If the police were as strict to crims like they are to cops, people would be scared to do crime
[4:08:53] imataka12: Jamgie Relax before the REAL storm hits
[4:08:53] sub084: @SmugPls should go both ways but in this case it seems like he only cares if its good and/or funny for him
[4:08:53] DaltonIRL: true but all the other cops involved have testimonials against cornwood probably why they feel obligated to punish
[4:08:54] Diamondman121314: but it's not content you want to make, you'd rather do cop stuff
[4:08:54] Vexamas: @EsfandTV I'm not to judge, but this is sort of what the argument for Den was, and your response was "just play your main as a civ, its good content"
[4:08:54] Jrey000: Cheevers off character said she does not care about that LULW
[4:08:55] Jeremyohno: Yeah, seems like a big OOC issue, that's being forced in rp.
[4:08:56] Zenysa: weee
[4:08:56] fellathedude: let's go Vigalantee Cornwood
[4:08:57] Recon_XoX: What you should learn from this is start LASO and get away from LSPD Daptains
[4:08:57] Toastedgamer03: yeah andrews is getting 5 daps also
[4:08:58] Scragglemuffin: WICKED
[4:08:58] owlx7: Crim's jail time VS Police Suspenstion time
[4:08:58] bertacharm: good thing you had the helmet
[4:08:59] Westlove_: Johnson got fired ffs
[4:09:01] thegummibearmassacre: 🐮
[4:09:02] CatmanJay: YO try making a CRIM and see how that same shit works lol @esfandtv
[4:09:03] rotarydawg: they are gonna put you on a suspension and open up the sheriffs office without you
[4:09:04] sturg2k5: look at Johnson that was bullshit aswell
[4:09:05] Gillshark: they also take way too long to get stuff done. They havent even looked into dens suspension
[4:09:05] Scragglemuffin: dune buggy
[4:09:05] PirateKing1600: fun RP should always be rewarded not punished
[4:09:05] wildarrow88: Well you might have to RP as a DR for awhile
[4:09:06] k9_goliath: part of the problem is that this show never ends.. the lifers are trying to protect what they can before everyone moves on from RP again
[4:09:07] PracticalNuke: WICKED sick ride Cornroll
[4:09:08] sendemup: the fact is, if anyone else did what cornwood did they would be fired on the spot
[4:09:10] TarvusPlz: It was the perfect cap to the day, too. Witch ANdrews pushing Cornwood to go harder all day, and Cornwood getting frustrated because he's restricted
[4:09:11] splooshtasticals: They've been targeting cornwood 4 weeks now LUL U hardly hear any peeps from the crim side. Its bonkers
[4:09:13] nimbleop: everyyime no pixel gets going it dog shit
[4:09:14] bertacharm: LULW
[4:09:14] krenblaylock: what happened to your tractor?
[4:09:14] Thozel: @SmugPls ah. Thank you esfandL
[4:09:14] afghanpsycho: there's a reason why SSaab has ran multiple PDs into the ground, he just doesn't understand
[4:09:15] LogicWeasel: gotta tell this no-fun PD Koil wants content on the server, not bullshit @EsfandTV
[4:09:17] owlx7: Crim's jail time VS Police Suspension time
[4:09:18] sturg2k5: luckily
[4:09:18] Pandrax86: @sub084 Bruh, that makes no sense..
[4:09:20] bertacharm: and he did that to himself
[4:09:20] TheKRT: @esfandtv can you talk to SSAAB about it OOC? or is that to far?
[4:09:20] Sonicfear: Part of rp is the consequences too
[4:09:20] shahul: thats because of K raid the day before
[4:09:21] Fozenoh: @EsfandTV, Johnson's preacher arc is so funny KEKW
[4:09:21] taraannee: since everyone else is mg fuck it, its not just HC, many pd ratted on cornwood in multiple situations, they're coming for ya
[4:09:22] stillbaALin: OOC what do you think about the firing and 30days until he can reapply to academy as a potential punishment for Dean?
[4:09:22] jmangaman: denzel is about to be fired
[4:09:23] Gusty331: EvilCorn arc when?
[4:09:23] TarvusPlz: then magdumping an attempted murderer
[4:09:23] miketwng: he's a cool cuh
[4:09:24] JammyHerring1: Remember when that dog dropped you with 1 simple bite to the Johnson lol
[4:09:26] RAMEEKILLEDSAMBAAS: bro cant becme a  priest lol
[4:09:26] rickyred66: What about people who don't stream?
[4:09:28] DrWetbone: anything you do could effect your stream, you may offend unintentionally with every word and every action
[4:09:28] Tsithik: okay so whos to say it wont be better for your stream too
[4:09:30] kratoids: well there you go then
[4:09:33] imataka12: What would Cornwood do if he wasn't an officer anymore? Hmm
[4:09:33] Trevor_x64: EVILCORN
[4:09:34] Viske: @EsfandTV did this happen today or is it the magdump clip?
[4:09:36] Doqx42: Can only make content for so much when the captains are not even around to do the review
[4:09:36] sturg2k5: could of fucked him tho
[4:09:37] ShadowedSeraphim: Plus Johnson had a chance to come clean and keep his job lol
[4:09:38] GloriousGlutton: would it be worth debating it ooc?
[4:09:39] Trevor_x64: THE REBEL KEKW
[4:09:39] 180jitter: That's because people feel bad for him
[4:09:39] TwoToes7: so in johnsons case consequence is good content?
[4:09:39] funzip_: as a man who just plays regular gta. you rp'ers are way too serious lmao
[4:09:40] BigglesVII: Yeah poor johnson, they keep brining out laws that screw him over. He started playing a pastor and the next day that law dropped prevemting it. Not targetted just unlucky.
[4:09:40] RobialT: True but he wants to stream as a cop too same as you do with Cornwood
[4:09:41] Dawnsaan: this is why i have always hated ruth's rp i understand that's her character but it's messing with IRL
[4:09:42] BSG_Reaper20: Thanks to K, but your stream isn't going to hurt any
[4:09:42] VSDuck: VSDuck subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! wooooo
[4:09:43] aahleas: sounds like you dont want to be a cop bub. police is there to regulate the city
[4:09:43] properenglishh: Johnson is a petty common name nothing special there
[4:09:46] Snicklefritz95: seems like some gatekeeping going on in the PD
[4:09:48] Messworld: nice lawnmower
[4:09:50] Westlove_: not really tho, because his cop rp with Mr K was popping off hard
[4:09:50] mad0monk: @Tsithik because this is Esfand, people are here to see Cornwood police, not the same thing at all
[4:09:53] theJOATx: vigilante cornwood was prime it wouldnt be bad to bring it back tbh @EsfandTV
[4:09:54] itWyrm: If cornwood became a crim they would just fat ID him every time LULW
[4:09:54] ZachFromChat: LULW yea the server literally make money because people watch so it has value
[4:09:55] MackPlays: Why is Cornwood homeless
[4:09:56] Capn_Stew: Nopixel isn't a super serious rp server
[4:09:56] DonnieRockettt: Cornwood getting suspended would hurt Police RP
[4:09:56] shahul: car looks fire tho
[4:09:57] TimmayHS: Have you ever thought of talking to Koil about some of this? @EsfandTV
[4:09:59] ABirky: 5  DAPS for excessive force?? Didn't the one life character STAB A POLICE OFFICER? Pretty sure that calls for lethal force.
[4:10:00] raiforen: if no one streamed no pixel would it even exist Hmmge
[4:10:00] MillerThyme: You're absolutely getting suspended, It'll be fun RP as punished cornwood
[4:10:01] PsychoJoker: @aahleas shitty take LUL
[4:10:01] claptil: Cornwood about to quit when he gets suspended
[4:10:02] Bojabes: it was a lot of content for them reviewing the whole situation too
[4:10:04] 1vivy: SERIOUS RP OONLY GRR
[4:10:05] splooshtasticals: LUL wat. They literally made into a money maker. Of course they want talent on the server
[4:10:06] Kelsier10: they use to be strict rp and Koil changed it for content
[4:10:06] ebos22: Ya but Iceman said in his stream onetime...that irl doesn't matter and didn't care about irl...and that there's 400 people he could be replaced by
[4:10:08] only_good_comments: most people don’t even rp in this server just grind jobs
[4:10:08] jzisawesom3: if youre playing nopixel in 2024 you saw it from a stream and know its a content server
[4:10:10] sticks26: Johnson's as cop would've taken him further imo. Civs and crims loved him
[4:10:11] CopperKat: without streams there would be no reason for any of the devs to work full time on it
[4:10:12] ItsEdBoi_: Cant pretend thats not cause it happened with K involved
[4:10:12] BaltorrShock: if you're on this server and you don't stream, it's a missed opportunity
[4:10:13] miketwng: Cornwood has to learn that this is the LSPD way
[4:10:14] Toastedgamer03: judge cornwood would also be good to see
[4:10:15] xxbigrebsxx: pickin buuggs
[4:10:15] HeyMeghan: I feel like if cornwood got fired moonmoon would lose his shit on max
[4:10:17] Viske: Anyone in chat got the time frame for what he might get in trouble for?
[4:10:19] sendemup: @ABirky bro 25 bullets is OVERLY excessive lmao
[4:10:20] greyjulian: why are there all these pro DAP people around?
[4:10:20] ben_v_art: like 80-90% of NP is probably on a stream
[4:10:20] nimbleop: then why is little texas taking so long to get going?
[4:10:21] funzip_: if cornwood just becomes a corrupt cop. i'd die laughing
[4:10:22] Viske: Or a clip :)
[4:10:23] mad0monk: Time for some SOD
[4:10:24] noah_a_104: judge cornwood
[4:10:24] Sabasc0: chat dumb question whats a dap
[4:10:26] Doqx42: Need to have daily 4am RP Content drop for the script :)
[4:10:26] ComradeGreetingCard: they always say RP it out but obviously it means different things to different players
[4:10:28] TheBlackRift: As long as all parties involved respect each other and have fun it shouldn't matter
[4:10:28] grimnasherr: you should ocean dump slacks EZ
[4:10:29] blahder: I think Ruth's funny af lol.  Just gotta make sure that when push comes to shove, ooc Ruth doesn't let things get out of hand
[4:10:31] bonkvpg: take away all the turbos
[4:10:34] Grammmpa: Johnson getting fired didn’t help his stream I think him getting in that fight with K and the RP with him and CG after he got fired is helping his stream
[4:10:34] ELesEff: ALLERGIES
[4:10:35] mrs_strawberryy: i miss 3.0
[4:10:35] jburke23: No one watches PD RP to see PD get reprimanded for fun sbs content
[4:10:36] joe_bags_: DAPing and suspending cornwood is long term bad for the server. there's a reason people love him
[4:10:36] doggensteinn: johnson tried to do church RP and they said he has to be registered with the state and theres no guidelines to get certified @esfandtv
[4:10:36] thegummibearmassacre: ALLERGIES
[4:10:37] aahleas: it aint a shitty take. police is there to enable others to have fun first and foremost that is why its a WL.
[4:10:38] GYNECHIATRIST: @greyjulian bunch of FASCISTS i tell ya hwut KKonaW
[4:10:38] stewchootrain: if you just stopped thinking its 3.0 i think you could enjoy it way more
[4:10:40] elsmokybear: I mean part of rp is taking on consequences for you actions in rp...
[4:10:40] yonkaaaa: digging for gold there bud
[4:10:40] IdipsuTV: DansGame
[4:10:43] Toastedgamer03: @ebos22 ssaab said today that the entire pd could protest and he would fire them all since there are 700 more people waiting
[4:10:43] mr_ache: FFS YOU GOSH DARN CORNWOODIOTS, THIS IS A CONTENT SERVER SO STOP YOUR BITCHIN AND MONIN AND ENJOY
[4:10:44] xxbigrebsxx: got some cliff hangers
[4:10:44] elSilvan: you need to offline discuss with PD usage of DAPs for rp purposes, i feel like the other person needs to be ok with their content changing dramatically
[4:10:44] DaltonIRL: don’t they make incidents for anything dap related
[4:10:46] bigfaiz: Sludge
[4:10:46] ULTRAKona_: so what happens when he got 5 daps did he get suspended or something
[4:10:46] Gusty331: Is this new police car? LUL
[4:10:46] cwasrightt: @Sabasc0 disciplinary action point
[4:10:47] pretzelz_kingz: I think both the cops and the crims would have a lot more fun if the cops were authorized to use more force
[4:10:48] ShadyMashX: 5 for the Donald Bush stuff and 1 for the aziz knight stuff pushes u to 10 daps total I think
[4:10:48] miketwng: @Sabasc0 Denzel Appreciation Points
[4:10:49] aaronalford24: If cornwood gets fired he should become a judge and make high commands life awful lol
[4:10:49] 180jitter: I miss 2.0
[4:10:49] Messworld: lol digging for gold haha
[4:10:49] aahleas: PD is the only WL left on the server for a reason
[4:10:50] warhawk384: sometimes I think people forget that Koil started nopixel to f-around and have fun. that's it
[4:10:51] Eeyley: @warner05 SBS = small brain syndrome, people say it to refer to shitlord behavior like random fistfights or towing an airplane
[4:10:53] 1vivy: ocean dump the captains KEKW
[4:10:57] TimmayHS: The WORST part of watching PD RP is people getting suspended or fired
[4:10:58] properenglishh: The rock I'm a Johnson-reporter you know that and Smith are the common most last names in America-rock Madge
[4:10:58] BigglesVII: Something needs to change with the DAPs all the frequent streamers have anxiety
[4:10:59] Recon_XoX: Damn Liberal Ass PD
[4:10:59] sendemup: LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[4:11:02] DonnieRockettt: I miss the Burger Shot spindsRain
[4:11:02] nimbleop: whips it on chair
[4:11:04] kylef_: "CoNsEqUeNcEs"
[4:11:04] manwod_77: https://clips.twitch.tv/BrightArbitrarySkirretDancingBaby-xcuOF5NX8rCUSGB5
[4:11:04] 9trashpanda9: the crim stabbed a cop in the throat
[4:11:06] Deviii_: all you have to do is half the dap duration from 60 to 30 days
[4:11:08] AnusReaktorMan: What's happened
[4:11:08] MillerThyme: If its an OOC issue then take it to Ssaab and Koil OOC dog.
[4:11:08] Kaseyfullofjoy: Yah thats dumb.
[4:11:08] the_main_burt: @Grammmpa yeah, so him getting fired then. LUL
[4:11:09] Snicklefritz95: it’s funny cause literally all the entertaining officers get dapped. it’s a trend
[4:11:09] 9trashpanda9: he earned the mag dump
[4:11:13] foxylady48: IMHO Ruth sees you as a threat , shes trying to get rid of you one by one
[4:11:16] xJustn: how do people not get this
[4:11:16] thegummibearmassacre: Chat NotLikeThis
[4:11:17] taraannee: ya but unfortunately despite HC knowing that, they ultimately said they dont care, doesnt matter LUL
[4:11:17] Sonicfear: You didn't know that
[4:11:17] PsychoJoker: They literally stabbed Andrews they wanted to die
[4:11:18] only_good_comments: time to ocean dump Ruth and slacks
[4:11:21] LogicWeasel: Pepega this chat saying the daps are good
[4:11:21] heftylefty_prime: Still waiting on those 700 applicants to stop G6 six robberies borpaSpin Still waiting on those 700 applicants to stop G6 six robberies borpaSpin Still waiting on those 700 applicants to stop G6 six robberies borpaSpin Still waiting on those 700 applicants to stop G6 six robberies borpaSpin
[4:11:22] rickyred66: Ok I was just wondering about the streaming sorry I didn't know that. Don't have to bite my head off.
[4:11:23] MackPlays: Stab THIS
[4:11:24] Viske: Chat, he's referring to the mag dump scene right?
[4:11:27] Viske: Okay good yeah he is
[4:11:28] ABirky: @sendemup Not trying to call IRL shit here, but cops magdump suspects IRL. You shoot until they're not moving anymore... Usually coming from multiple officers. I dont understand the excessive force DAPS. Only one I could understand is the shooting the corpse after the guy died
[4:11:29] ebos22: @toastedgamer03 I don't think that's a good philosophy
[4:11:29] miketwng: nice kart tho
[4:11:29] eklu65: do you want revenge, or do you want to continue playing by the rules? they want to suspend andrews too
[4:11:30] pacific_kool3r: Cop viewers trying to follow grand theft auto rp rules BabyRage BabyRage
[4:11:30] Vexamas: I think people get it, but don't think that's a reasonable enough excuse because of the meta behind it - for better or worse
[4:11:30] Vikairius: Was legitimately a non-canon interaction as far as I am concerned
[4:11:31] Lordrune13: stabbed a cop in the throat like what
[4:11:31] warner05: @eeyley Ah!  I knew the definition but didn't get the relationship in RP.  Thanks!
[4:11:31] MothyNZ: imho I think the PD will much rather have Cornwood inside pissing out rather than Cornwood outside pissing in.
[4:11:31] AlexSamaAU: in character thatd still be the thing to do what
[4:11:32] shahul: yeah sometimes people gotta chill a little
[4:11:33] BigglesVII: @Viske yh
[4:11:33] Trevor_x64: not ooc when it is so connected
[4:11:34] Pandrax86: Esfand literally puts hours everyday into HELPING everyone else with their RP and content... the ONE time he has fun he is shot down and destroyed with daps
[4:11:34] bertacharm: now getting a dap for the one for baas makes sense but other thant hat
[4:11:34] DwarvenC: @MillerThyme pretty sure he kinda has
[4:11:35] PirateKing1600: spittin facts
[4:11:36] kheg_: in character doesnt matter lol
[4:11:38] itWyrm: its 'consequences' until Ruth does sus shit going off duty then its justified LULW
[4:11:39] SmugPls: @EsfandTV these consequences are too deep. 10 Daps should be 24 hours at most if stupid daps like shoes is 60 days. Imagine wearing wrong shoes 1 time a week. thats 8 daps in 60 days... for shoes... then suspended indefinately...?
[4:11:40] funzip_: @TimmayHS but actually the funniest KEKW
[4:11:40] gheto_gecko: doesnt make sense how cornwood is all high and might when it comes down to it but he'll go off and steal cars and shit and goof off like this
[4:11:41] grimnasherr: bro the PD is so fuckin pathetic right now its sad
[4:11:42] BSG_Reaper20: And got shot a lot by those 8 cops. Didn't need the 20 extra
[4:11:44] Viske: Who was the stab character? @BigglesVII
[4:11:44] mclovins1g: This is a no fun pd ReallyMad follow inline
[4:11:46] greyjulian: There were two cops on duty last night.  TWO. For the entire server.  after two months…… the server still isn’t being properly policed - it fucks over the pd experience, the civ experience, and the crim experience.  this is due to leadership using DAPs and not training their hires effectively
[4:11:46] claptil: YEP
[4:11:47] KaycasTV: bunch of retarded fuck rp frogs in chat KEKW
[4:11:48] JammyHerring1: yeah thats a bit far for a "one lifer"
[4:11:48] Recon_XoX: Time to move to ONX
[4:11:48] brukk__: @EsfandTV i think people gonna hate pd even more while they're doing content pd does simulation rp and its gonna clash at one point KEKW
[4:11:48] pacific_kool3r: Cop viewers trying to follow grand theft auto rp rules BabyRage BabyRage BabyRage
[4:11:48] splooshtasticals: pepeLaugh more & more will see the foolishness. Speak bruh
[4:11:48] PracticalNuke: YEP
[4:11:49] ShadyMashX: They want to give Andrews 5 as well for egging him on

[4:11:49] Slymask3: YEP

[4:11:49] Jrey000: YEP
[4:11:49] ElizabethAtDawn: I’d get it if it had long term affects but it’s just a random one off situation so why do they care so much
[4:11:49] itsalviiin: YEP
[4:11:50] Toastedgamer03: @ebos22 it really isn't but now i wanna see judge cornwood and slacks ftoing 700 people KEKW
[4:11:50] Snicklefritz95: are you an entertaining cop? here’s your dap
[4:11:50] MackPlays: Cletus Acornwood
[4:11:51] RAMEEKILLEDSAMBAAS: RP is a two way street
[4:11:51] gatsymphony00: @miketwng without cornwood streaming no one would give a shit about pd...there is no penta, kyle, or angel anymore and moomoon is great but not gonna be his main eveyr if the city is on fire
[4:11:52] MillerThyme: Talk to ssaab ooc then and make it clear.
[4:11:52] bertacharm: ruining the storyline for no reason
[4:11:53] avaell_: YEP
[4:11:54] smokeweedeverydad: STABBING A COP IS AUTOMATICLY A SHOOT ON SIGHT THOUGH LULW WTF ARE THE PD EVEN FUCKING DOING ????
[4:11:54] jzisawesom3: 100%
[4:11:54] miketwng: YEP
[4:11:57] ComradeGreetingCard: if it was ruth it would have happened
[4:11:57] AnusReaktorMan: Hello what's happened chat???
[4:11:57] cavastyle: @esfandtv  even if you shot him once he was still perma his character
[4:11:58] tarzandaking: That how the sheriff in Polk county Florida would have handled it
[4:11:59] RobialT: Seems like the Captains dont care about that
[4:11:59] taraannee: but thats the thing! you're one of very few playing w that mentality
[4:12:00] Wiipotato: Or when you searched Mr. K with the pd glock
[4:12:01] PirateKing1600: dudes SPITTIN
[4:12:01] BigglesVII: @Viske Deans sunday 1 lifer
[4:12:02] nimbleop: Maby you should have
[4:12:03] Ciefon: ssaab literally said on stream that it doesn't matter if it's a one life char
[4:12:03] Kelborn: and the only people even talking about it anymore is the Captains, the punishing is stupid because ultimately, itll restrict RP which is the whole point of what we are here for
[4:12:04] TimmayHS: @funzip_ I disagree, not when it's like Denzel getting actually fired tomorrow
[4:12:04] bertacharm: mhm

[4:12:07] KerotanTUXEDO: mhm
[4:12:08] milsoup: The PD needs Conan Clarkson
[4:12:08] ElizabethAtDawn: he’s cooking
[4:12:09] claptil: If Ramee was charged for that it would have been so horrible
[4:12:09] Perterter: I think a lot of the PD has a different idea of how they want to play this........
[4:12:09] sticks26: Even if consequences are necessary, 5 DAPS is excessive for anything
[4:12:10] znaebs: esfand is right. the descision to dap like it is done. is bad fpr rp
[4:12:10] PirateKing1600: true

[4:12:13] Viske: @BigglesVII thanks :)
[4:12:14] sheikhy: you should have got 1 DAP MAX
[4:12:14] ChainSaw762: continous problem on this server

[4:12:25] pacific_kool3r: Its not good faith 🤓
[4:12:25] edenobi: exactly. which is why its so boring to see all the limitations you guys in the PD get
[4:12:26] afghanpsycho: ssaab doesnt care and his chat was egging him on to fire you.
[4:12:26] natalieb424: YEP

[4:12:29] MackPlays: I cant wait for Ramee's DNA on file
[4:12:29] cebron808: CAUSE PD IS TERRIBLE
[4:12:29] MothyNZ: Wait Cornwood is getting dapped for shooting someone who stabbed a cop?
[4:12:30] GhostlyHugs: RP is rolling with the punches though, have armor on you, expect RP consequences
[4:12:30] gheto_gecko: cornwood has so much dirt on his hands and thinks nothing of it
[4:12:31] StevenJWElens: dean was gonna perma after the other officers shot anyways so the extra shots by cornwood was just content
[4:12:31] SmugPls: @Kelborn TRUE i forgot the shit even happened until Ssaab started reviewing it today LUL
[4:12:32] D00kieSh0es: PD just needs to read the room. maybe make the distrust there but not actual consequences that hurts the content
[4:12:32] imataka12: Literally gave you a gun when you were in the interrogation room and no one questioned him OMEGALUL
[4:12:34] greyjulian: @kelborn Captains that aren’t around enough because of irl
[4:12:34] Brave_Silver: when did this happen is there a clip
[4:12:35] Xierany: Well in case of Ramee you did not do something for RP, in the other you did something for RP. One is hidden in RP, the other is very visible
[4:12:35] properenglishh: Classic so you admit you're a content creator with social media?
[4:12:35] IdipsuTV: straight honest cornwood mhm
[4:12:37] Tsithik: what happens happens bruh it is what it issss
[4:12:38] shaun_chi: LULW
[4:12:39] Zenysa: I think ooc they need to decide if they want unreasonable daps and other senior decisions to be fought within RP, or ooc. bc either way they need to be fought
[4:12:41] CopperKat: AT THIS POINT WHY DON'T YOU SPEAK OOC TO THEM AND SOLVE IT?? ITS AN OOC ISSUE AND DECISION
[4:12:41] lightwarrior2088: Cops on their alt characters causing all the DAPS
[4:12:42] MrPersevere: Is this the Tik Tok Cletus
[4:12:43] HeyMeghan: @esfandtv what do you think about the fact that cornwood got 3 daps for conduct unbecoming of an officer but Duncan has gotten dapped for that twice and only gotten one dap each time?
[4:12:43] AnusReaktorMan: Hello what's happened chat???
[4:12:45] VincentsDeath: what if Cornwood steps down from LSPD to start a new PD (laso) department ran though the mayor's office
[4:12:46] Biffus1337: IMO there's alrdy a BIG lack of police actually policing. why is that? well the only ppl who do policing getting dapped every 3rd pursuit
[4:12:47] Bojabes: I think the problem comes from the extra shot after everyone said to stop. it was funny tho
[4:12:47] AerrowTheNF: different rules for different people?
[4:12:47] dains84: again... an RP cop is max dapping a RL cop (Andrews) for simply saying... "Im looking for a reason to shoot"  (they're saying 5 DAPs for Andrews as well) @EsfandTV
[4:12:49] BohLTss: Johnson also lost his irl job same week he got screwed in game so double whammy suckedddddddddddddddddd
[4:12:50] blahder: Ssaab was getting lots of shit though to tbf
[4:12:50] GILx87: Who did Cornwood shoot, guys?
[4:12:52] ColonelCathcart: Saab is literally the worst rper
[4:12:53] drfoddy: cornwood got dapped?
[4:12:53] Ciefon: you're right that it doesn't matter what chat thinks but ssaab literally said on stream that it doesn't matter if it's a one life char
[4:12:53] aitqwa: adaptability is an important rp skill
[4:12:54] blahder: His chat was wild
[4:12:56] Kaseyfullofjoy: Daily date with doctor Kate
[4:12:57] ben_v_art: BASED Ramee is full send crim and somehow hasn't got caught on a job
[4:12:58] SLOWKID98: lmao then defending the same people he did robberies with in court
[4:12:59] imNikoTV: Where's the clip?
[4:12:59] everyone1980: makes complete sense
[4:13:01] bertacharm: and people think you get special treatment
[4:13:01] pacific_kool3r: BatChest consequences
[4:13:02] cqmer0n_193: Kate talks a lot
[4:13:03] Toastedgamer03: it just feels like the captains aren't in it for content rp and just want more serious rp
[4:13:03] vozalth: Guess thats how they want to run the pd rp that way
[4:13:04] Grammmpa: he was freaking out earlier today cause his rental was involved in a chase he was afraid if they got caught in it with him he would lose it 😂 how daps is cornwood getting?
[4:13:04] CopperKat: why don't you speak OOC to them and just say it
[4:13:04] Reuschel: DAPs are just insane because of how punishing they are. No situation should ever be 5 DAPs. if a situation is worth that many DAPs, that person should probably be fired for whatever they did because it would have to be so insane. but you can barely do shit and get 3+ DAPs.
[4:13:06] Toastbane: Sheriffs office seperate department
[4:13:09] miketwng: "Stop having fun. We care" - LSPD
[4:13:11] Kota216: wait when did cornwood get dapped? just now?
[4:13:11] NikouPikouVS: @EsfandTV wait can you explained what happend
[4:13:12] neighborhoodcapricorn: You are completely right
[4:13:12] CopperKat: this is an OOC convo you need to have together
[4:13:12] bigjay7777: officers need to go on strike
[4:13:12] MillerThyme: Ok talk with admins off stream then dog
[4:13:13] funky_fresh_max: this music is a whole vibe
[4:13:14] magnets_: the 1lifer was already dead and had the opportunity to rp his perma without the magdumb
[4:13:14] driver1036: Cornwood shot Dean's alt
[4:13:15] Shakestar: Should talk to Saab OOC, he's a bit too letter of the law with police RP
[4:13:15] sturg2k5: god knows how he ant been caught he’s a shit driver aswell haha
[4:13:15] AnusReaktorMan: Hello what's happened chat???
[4:13:17] sealemons: make a one lifer and stab saab LUL
[4:13:17] warner05: Anyone have a Clip for what he's talking about??
[4:13:17] elSilvan: are daps for server admin or rp?
[4:13:17] TimmayHS: I just think this is one giant communication issue. It stems with the captains and their lack of awareness/presence
[4:13:17] MackPlays: Its all gud fud dud
[4:13:18] kosmojono: YO ES esfandHappy
[4:13:19] everyone1980: you got in trouble for doing the right thing.
[4:13:19] TheGodmother: ColonelCathcart come on now esfandPains
[4:13:19] HungorianHotpockets: so don’t rp on an rp server?
[4:13:21] EvilCoatrack: there just shouldn't have been a police report about it tbh
[4:13:22] Trevor_x64: sue em
[4:13:22] BigglesVII: Your missing the briefing
[4:13:23] happylagoon1: ssaab literally said on stream that it doesn't matter if it's a one life char
[4:13:24] ultimategamersan: fun killer police
[4:13:25] splooshtasticals: @lightwarrior2088 Big time LUL like u can't help but question integrity at this point
[4:13:25] jmangaman: its wild since u just lost like 4 daps 2 days ago
[4:13:26] ShadyMashX: That incident is gonna result in 10 daps given out to u and andrews
[4:13:26] Kota216: i just got back, corn got dapped?
[4:13:27] TheKRT: @esfandtv I’d be pissed if Cornwood got fired cuz it’s one of the best things I’ve been watching on Twitch ever, helps me through university
[4:13:28] bertacharm: cornwood sure gets special treatment huh
[4:13:28] Hellkite1534: or charging the mayor with a felony before the election
[4:13:28] greyjulian: DAP stacking is just… nuts
[4:13:28] Recon_XoX: PD are trying to suspend cornwood over bullshit
[4:13:28] MrPersevere: Daps stink booo
[4:13:29] Jrey000: this is a convo you need to have OOC
[4:13:29] MistaMista: @ColonelCathcart why
[4:13:30] nimbleop: No pixel will always remain a crapy server
[4:13:32] kosmojono: @thegodmother HypeWave esfandL esfandHappy
[4:13:33] CallMeElie: if you get fired make a rp of a militia with other friends and criminal friends
[4:13:34] k1nneDECIR: @kosmojono . VoHiYo
[4:13:35] shahul: escapes robbery and in 2 mins shows up to represent them as lawyer LUL
[4:13:35] calcifero7: the main problem is the stacking
[4:13:37] CopperKat: why do you complain about it on stream hoping it will change when youre OOC FRIENDS WITH SAAB AND CAN JUST FUCKING ASK?
[4:13:37] gatsymphony00: I mean mission successful Crims are way funner to watch because they dont have 8 miles of red tape on them
[4:13:38] Wallsh_: @EsfandTV mcnulty reccomended no daps for the knight situation and still going ahead with it
[4:13:40] nimbleop: for that reason
[4:13:42] smokeweedeverydad: PD has fallen off WAY TOO HARD for them to do shit effectively and this is the nail in the coffin IMO.
[4:13:45] kosmojono: @k1nnedecir HypeWave esfandL esfandHappy
[4:13:47] k1nneDECIR: @kosmojono . esfandL
[4:13:47] ithurtswhenlP2: Stop caring so much about what the trolls in your chat think
[4:13:47] SmugPls: @EsfandTV Imagine you get 1 dap for talking to much like duncan a week. for 8 weeks which is inside 60 days. 8 daps for talking. and 2 random ones gets you INDEFINATELY SUSPENDED LUL
[4:13:47] TheGodmother: kosmojono hey! esfandL dankHug

[4:13:49] BohLTss: PD union incomingggggggggg
[4:13:49] GloriousGlutton: explain in ooc maybe?
[4:13:50] Slymask3: kekw
[4:13:51] JasonGrims707: so is this script server now lol?
[4:13:51] Pandrax86: Problem is no one is policing the RP at the captain level. Ssaab is great but he has taken his role as sole leader and admin of all police to the extreme.
[4:13:54] Trevor_x64: Cornwood v. LSPD
[4:13:59] TimmayHS: @Wallsh_ McNulty was the ONLY one that had Cornwood's back
[4:14:03] nimbleop: LET THE PLAYERS MAKE THE CONTENT
[4:14:04] miketwng: MDW was better
[4:14:04] Mandrenn: there is a reason no one wants to play pd

[4:14:14] properenglishh: BCWarrior I'm famous.  Classic your profile says digital creator
[4:14:16] Lordrune13: server dieing LUL
[4:14:18] Kelborn: @happylagoon1 if thats the case then his thought on the matter are just not in the right place. The main issue with the whole thing is, the command doesnt have anyone dapping them, and theyre not seeing what this system is doing to the people under them
[4:14:23] thegummibearmassacre: @CopperKat HUH
[4:14:24] DaltonIRL: the incident report from Ruth literally says cornwood suspended she’s just a robot that doesn’t allow anything to slide
[4:14:27] REDMVGE: rp experts in the chat kekw just let the players figure it out
[4:14:28] ebos22: That's the one issue with this rp I haven't figured out.....it's like it needs a DM to keep everything balanced...where's Matt Mercer lol
[4:14:28] Venatio_: My guess is they are afraid of that it starts to become to much of sillyness and less and less of RP experience
[4:14:28] JammyHerring1: If you get put on desk work for awhile who will be out policing ?
[4:14:33] KerotanTUXEDO: How long are 5 daps?
[4:14:33] splooshtasticals: Keep speaking out pepeLaugh its more effective than u think brother
[4:14:36] drfoddy: so what happened?
[4:14:37] imataka12: tbf I can see Cornwood getting indef suspended causing massive amounts of unrest in literally every part of the server

[4:14:54] DonnieRockettt: Each PD has their own set of rules and Cornwood as sheriff would change things
[4:14:58] StormiNyan: xdd
[4:15:01] imataka12: mhm
[4:15:05] Lordrune13: its marv
[4:15:07] LHaxorP: Dean RP'd in the hospital that it wasnt a mag dump which should be his choice to determine that... imo the only DAP abel thing was the one "extra pop" as that was soley cornwoods choice... its jsut weird to not consider Deans thoughts/choice on the matter at all
[4:15:07] heftylefty_prime: Are we getting those apparent 700 police officers soon?
[4:15:07] Kalimad: you ever seen the drunk in andi griffith?

[4:15:16] greyjulian: Cornwood getting suspended might be the wake-up call they need
[4:15:17] Pandrax86: @Toastedgamer03 I think ssaab just lost sight of the original goal. he had the right intentions... but I don't know where it veered off.
[4:15:19] Brave_Silver: There’s a meeting rn right
[4:15:22] coach_dad: Free food

[4:15:43] grimnasherr: CORNWOOD FOR CHIEF
[4:15:51] JammyHerring1: @BigglesVII so no sheriff then? lol
[4:15:51] Toastedgamer03: @chillaxinvibes no because even when told several times even by their own seniors they don't see it as a problem

[4:16:03] Serakkis: casually hops into a buggy and drives off LUL
[4:16:05] searlesbarkleyk: They need fake punishments to mete out for obvious RP scenes. The problem is these cops need to keep their RP real so when they talk about it, logically they need to push for punishment in character. That's why you mete out a fake punishment for these cases.
[4:16:05] SmugPls: @Kota216 not yet. Ssaab is waiting to have a meeting with all 3 captains.. eventually??? over it
[4:16:08] MaRiNexICEx: To the corn Mobile!!!! 🌽

[4:16:18] greyjulian: Mayor Thoroughbred will just vote Cornwood in as the city selected Chief and we’ll be good
[4:16:19] CallMeElie: I would like to see corn wood turn into a villain
[4:16:21] HadEbola: @chillaxinvibes their mindset is "we'll just hire someone who wants to be here"
[4:16:23] HeyMeghan: you know how max is yung dab? cornwood should make an alt called ol’ dap lmao
[4:16:25] Mandrenn: would be so funny if they made you chief of police.
[4:16:26] splooshtasticals: Doesn't matter what they say tbf LUL the server can easily outweight anything the PD does. Its the peoples server.
[4:16:26] DwarvenC: @BigglesVII sherif isnt a pd decision its a mayor decison

[4:16:33] Vikairius: What  I have learned is to never mess with a police officer that is suspended or fired.
[4:16:36] BigglesVII: @taraannee With it only needing support of 2 out of 3 captains Ruth will agree all day long.
[4:16:37] xnightshift2658: So is cornwood about to get suspended?
[4:16:38] the_solid_milk: @gardangar LULW
[4:16:39] CopperKat: what is their OOC reason for doing it esfand? Have you spoken to them OOC?
[4:16:42] mensrea123: well maybe you'll see why the PD needs a union in this structure
[4:16:43] MothyNZ: If PD chooses Sheriff then all civilians should get to vote who takes Chief imho. Theyre political positions
[4:16:44] Toastedgamer03: @greyjulian honestly with how much he doesn't like the captains now i wouldn't be surprised if he tried to demote them
[4:16:44] warner05: To be fair, Cheever was laughing hilariously saying Wtf Cornwood.  Buuut, she said Ruth was gonna have a problem with it.  I mean.  Is what it is I guess.
[4:16:45] TexanRampage92: should you run for CoP instead of sheriff
[4:16:46] chillaxinvibes: @Toastedgamer03 it's a shame because they will lose good cops this way.

[5:33:32] jdotno: Definitely the locals fault, for sure
[5:33:35] Biffus1337: i remember the orange mazda on academy which was literally indestructable until it hit a gastank
[5:33:36] the_bucket_plays: thats the actual reason it sounds BS buts it real
[5:33:37] BLZbubs: @horrrified visual contact broken
[5:33:39] MrBASins: or have less AI
[5:33:39] KaycasTV: gta locals Classic
[5:33:41] geckoguy69: NPCs have actual logic that makes them turn into you
[5:33:44] geckoguy69: it's programmed
[5:33:45] Wallsh_: @EsfandTV btw that gta call was where bell showed those pictures in the meeting

[5:34:34] willietrom: smart call
[5:34:38] magnets_: i dont think she's on rn
[5:34:40] Janman88: dispatch is only deko as far as the most treat them
[5:34:43] ActuallySupremacy: how did they get a track on the car
[5:34:44] thebigshabam: 100% esp since dispatch was complaining they dont have alot to do
[5:34:45] Vasy_y: LSPD should reward more dispatch so they enlist more
[5:34:48] SupportCarryy: give dispatch the heli
[5:34:50] Felaryn: The AI actually intentionally crashes into you. Its actually super annoying especially when you turn on sirens and it for some reason gets even worse
[5:34:51] CountDrax: If they do not want to balance PD cars vs other cars, the cost to repair sould be 1/4
[5:34:56] Jimmy_Tha_Quad: This car is terrible
[5:35:01] keleviii: need Dispatch Academy for tracked chases NODDERS
[5:35:03] XLKyle: pretty sure they did in 3.0
[5:35:04] Kaiyo_exe: Can't wait for the cops to have helis
[5:35:08] Janizki_Fin: dispatch 311'd that her radio is scuffed chat. chill.
[5:35:08] warner05: Dispatch could call tracker and see units so easily.  They could set up places for spikes easily @esfandtv
[5:35:09] wildarrow88: This car is fucked
[5:35:09] johnmalkovich95: @Vasy_y Slacks working on it now
[5:35:10] Shinkster: why ain’t you running code?
[5:35:13] Toastbane: you need the caracara speed for this
[5:35:13] ciphz: i love jadelyn but i cant expect her on 24/7 to dispatch
[5:35:20] ltdanny2: Cant find it I know its on epicstore account
[5:35:21] yourpalpepe: Ask for Spikes
[5:35:24] DrakeNightbane: That's just normal local behavior i've seen in 4.0. They always turn into you.
[5:35:25] ltdanny2: didn play for 8 years
[5:35:28] GigitySponges: He's reaching he's reaching
[5:35:29] BinchMcSwerve: i wish i could see you on ONX. i know at this point it aint gonna happen but just sayin
[5:35:31] autisticboots: SURELY HAVE A UNIT IN THE CITY WAITING
[5:35:32] Biffus1337: @Felaryn koil explained the sirens thing but sometimes locals are crazy even without sirens
[5:35:33] GigitySponges: Kappa
[5:35:35] willietrom: they should just give dispatch tools for fun, like they have advance warning of what the weather will be at later times so you can radio in for forecasts
[5:35:37] LogicWeasel: Jadelyn is online chat, she 311'd to say her radio is acting up
[5:35:40] the_main_burt: the scout was pulling 170 EZ best for this
[5:35:40] ltdanny2: need to look through email list jeezez dats work
[5:35:40] Kaiyo_exe: @EsfandTV Is it maybe not weight effecting the speed of the car ?
[5:35:40] Vasy_y: @johnmalkovich95 oh thats great
[5:35:42] Xierany: @Felaryn The siren AI is actually logical, just not very practical. He tested it with another Officer the other day
[5:35:45] Jimmy_Tha_Quad: It only has four gears?
[5:35:46] Janman88: same as PD not having a hotline where people can call for anything instead of that stupid chatbox which nobody reads
[5:35:46] TimmayHS: Too bad you couldn't have STARTED from up north...
[5:35:49] Diminim: same thing though sometimes the sirens didn't work at all, probably gets stuck in siren mode for the AI sometimes
[5:35:55] Janman88: why is dispatch not taking any calls
[5:35:57] Janizki_Fin: @the_main_burt was it the one cornwood put a 99 in?
[5:36:01] wildarrow88: We need that Vstar for highways
[5:36:02] tischance: It hit 5th for one second
[5:36:04] DeoNone: @binchmcswerve he played once for 10 mins as his sbs character
[5:36:05] ST4NKiii: well looks like its time to get a manual cornwood
[5:36:07] JammyHerring1: @Janman88 no one home?
[5:36:08] hollowrust: hollowrust subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! thanks for all the streams <3
[5:36:09] ASPARAGUSruns: @binchmcswerve I see that as a possibility when ONX adds more stuff and is more complete
[5:36:13] JasonMunday: Pog
[5:36:13] bertacharm: :) there's no units on it
[5:36:16] Rawhiders69: WICKED

[5:36:38] BinchMcSwerve: @DeoNone oh shit really? i missed it lol
[5:36:39] Janizki_Fin: @Janizki_Fin Cornwood put in Aldos personal one a 99
[5:36:41] miketwng: cool car to cruise on the highway but it sure aint faster than a turbo
[5:36:44] Acebravo_nz: 152 nice
[5:36:46] eklu65: 5th gear, over 150
[5:36:46] johnmalkovich95: @Vasy_y but "IT side" make it much difficult
[5:36:48] BinchMcSwerve: @ASPARAGUSruns thatd be dope. i wont hold my breath thought lol
[5:36:52] the_bucket_plays: so who got yoinked
[5:37:00] davidayotte: I were flyin I seen 158

[5:37:38] despicablewebb: on the mini map
[5:37:39] Janman88: do u know the reason why there is only a 911 chatbox and no number to call anyone? @EsfandTV
[5:37:46] Wallsh_: @EsfandTV someone needs to track their routes for investigation
[5:37:47] Zhang_1888: @despicablewebb someone dead there
[5:37:51] Acebravo_nz: spike setup opportunity
[5:38:03] itWyrm: @Janman88 No one wants to sit there and answer calls from randoms all day, they tried it in 3.0
[5:38:07] Felaryn: @Xierany in GTA Online if you don't drive actually in the middle of the road they'll just turn into you, at least that's my experience. I hope GTA 6 has AI that doesn't ram me for no reason
[5:38:11] warner05: ?????
[5:38:11] godzillasmicrowave: @Janman88 that'd be overwhelming as shit
[5:38:15] keleviii: screw the spike , thrown down that cement barrier LUL

[5:38:34] MrBASins: I was testing the AI on my FiveM Server and the Ai cars on the hwy/freefway were actively drive toward me on my feet on the freeway so it 100% an Ai thing they really do do it on purpose at times
[5:38:35] Janman88: @itWyrm so dispatch would have more meaning ?!
[5:38:36] Seetherrr: @itWyrm It isn't that bad, they do it on ONX, all PD members can answer 911/311
[5:38:39] bertacharm: damb

[6:32:32] Nsan7: try 2nd gear from dead stop instead of first it might not spin as much
[6:32:34] sendemup: braking points, brake late but brake hard, throttle out
