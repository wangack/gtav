[1:54:50] Questhere: Stab üíî
[1:54:59] abblepiewit: that doesn't even make sense when Tom is clearly in on the joke with Bev.
[1:55:10] doc_sharon: chat is gonna have a tough time when we go to war if they don't get over stuff like this KEKW
[1:55:30] mohler_47: also these characters can speak for themselves
[1:55:31] Pleasantmsp: KEKW
[1:55:36] itsjustasummerjob: Yeah part of what makes this fun (for me as a viewer / toxic chatter) is that Tom has invested time and energy into a person he knows is emotionally unavailable. Like. What‚Äôs he expecting??? It makes for good drama!
[1:55:37] Crafty_Crystal: katesGiggle
[1:55:39] rickbuh: anybodies Hallpass...oh wait LUL
[1:55:39] jedi_raccoon: Go Maxx
[1:55:45] Insaif: Tom himself also knows that Maxx doesn't do emotions, so it's not like he can't expect this reaction from her either. katesShrug
[1:55:50] NoharTheShark: bev is gonna land a supermodel someday 100%
[1:55:57] Pleasantmsp: @itsjustasummerjob 100% Same thoughts

[1:56:07] lorddracnor: hell yeah bruddah
[1:56:07] Shandercy: Bev has the sex appeal of a 7 day old banana. Like, you know it's not gonna do permanent damage, but...... LOOK AT IT. It's just not good.
[1:56:16] doc_sharon: chat, do not model after Summer - she is allowed to be a toxic chatter, you are not KEKW
[1:56:26] Kthanid: Yeah Pear knows EXACTLY what's up

[1:57:14] itGlenn: AAAA
