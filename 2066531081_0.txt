[5:16:31] xl_anarchist_lx: yeah I don‚Äôt think cornwood would have don‚Äôt that
[5:16:32] Acheron13: You guys didn't use a gun so they shouldn't be that agressive
[5:16:33] asheryy1: OOOO blue
[5:16:36] jaswho2: they arent supposed to ram until they get permission so thats probably why
[5:16:38] ithurtswhenlP2: wait‚Ä¶? did you say you guys didn‚Äôt get the cash from the safe?
[5:16:38] Guielme: it was very scuffed from the cops perspective, it lagged and then every was hitting each other, luck they wore nice
[5:16:39] goodenhi: noice half way there
[5:16:40] ruulqt: its rp rules
[5:16:40] wildturkeyno9: @Bestevenn_ SeemsGood
[5:16:43] lore_angel_: That was hell fun to watch!
[5:16:47] Frostring: they aren't allowed to ram you like that either
[5:16:48] AFFABLE__: A headache is fine to pause the rp.
[5:16:49] Thunderpint: Good faith is all it is
[5:16:49] BubFrost: one guy
[5:16:50] zaidmir: is there a clip?
[5:16:50] momzzyy: you got a W cop cause momo was not cooking PepeLaugh
[5:16:50] midzito: its not
[5:16:51] lore_angel_: hella
[5:16:51] dredraider: it was headache for her
[5:16:53] counttolstoy: yes
[5:16:54] Nulltiply: ReallyMad
[5:16:55] kb420ps: @darkpwnz You're right.
[5:16:55] PRE5TO_: ???
[5:16:56] Villenthessis: yeah if someone headpopped, they give chances
[5:16:56] Pepejaa: om
[5:16:57] Ginoveli: acieWADDLE
[5:16:57] Absinto1: yes
[5:16:57] UrClassicDerp: no
[5:16:59] crom93: its 50/50, depends entirely on the cop
[5:17:00] someduduman: did they get usb?
[5:17:01] joyoruz: om
[5:17:01] azh314: how the fuck did momo get out in that shitbox??
[5:17:02] Syntai_dev: No its no rule. It's basically them being nice
[5:17:02] Buffalohed: if that was lenny hawk youd be in jail
[5:17:03] lukigeri: soy
[5:17:04] RagoDK: its to extend rp rather then catching bad W
[5:17:04] Guielme: its not rules, its players discression @Acie
[5:17:06] jrt103: w cops
[5:17:06] jaswho2: 3 EZ
[5:17:07] MrLebowski_: No lol cops arrest in those situations all the time
[5:17:08] AddyAdam: yeah they have a lot of rules they have to follow to make it fare
[5:17:08] IraqiWizard: @Acie the only reason they did that is because you guys were in a really shit car
[5:17:08] Tenivir: there is no rules for that no, but they want RP and good content over scuff
[5:17:09] AurelStar: On this serv at least lol
[5:17:09] crom93: normally just play the scuff out, shit happens
[5:17:10] BubFrost: Its not rules it depends on the cop
[5:17:10] cebron808: proper plan yes
[5:17:11] madworlds71: never listen to eugene
[5:17:11] Marilyn_1020: what‚Äôs peanuts stream?
[5:17:11] midzito: its 100% up to her what to do in that spot.
[5:17:11] AiSOtv_: if u hit cops car they will ramp u
[5:17:12] ST4NKiii: the reason they pit u was cuz in their eyes u wherer furthere away
[5:17:12] Alonort00: That was a big ram too
[5:17:13] Vesquix: If its due to the headache you pause thats it
[5:17:14] Nova__Cannon: I mean the "Play it out" rule also makes it an up to the cops thing mostly
[5:17:15] mrbouda1: it depends on the situation and the cop
[5:17:15] Tuga_cef: Eugene said yesterday that the ramming starts after 2 swaps or something
[5:17:15] Bagsnificent: OMEGALUL
[5:17:16] AddyAdam: YOU GUYS DID IT THO!
[5:17:16] Robsterclaus: Yeah, her headache lead to the ram so reseting there seemed like her righting the situation instead of taking advantage of it.
[5:17:16] flyyingakuma: all good. the cop actually had bad headache.
[5:17:16] jag_erz: i love how chat just makes shit up and pretends like it's factr
[5:17:16] Aleron222: how many colors are there
[5:17:17] Vesquix: Yes
[5:17:18] 42arc: problem was Glendale is a shit car
[5:17:18] Iamdroza: how many usb colors are there supposed to be?
[5:17:18] Tueur562: Just depends on the cop. At some point the cops will get better and it will be a lot harder.
[5:17:21] begixdxd: It all comes down to which cop is there, a lot of cops just chase the W and go for taze/tackle arrest
[5:17:22] triniassassin10: you guys just had a terrible car though
[5:17:22] simmeringteapot: it‚Äôs not a rule, they are just nice
[5:17:23] piyuoo: BUt you made it
[5:17:23] gabriella_luvv: a lil rough
[5:17:24] Shikafrecko: you just cant get mad when they dont roll with scuff but usually they do
[5:17:25] Bagsnificent: sometimes it's almost like eugene wants you to get caught...
[5:17:25] Pepejaa: o7 alex
[5:17:25] cebron808: eugene always wings it
[5:17:29] Nulltiply: Flirt Clays sani outfit kinda manly
[5:17:29] crookz_n_castlez: Got crates back, got help from momo, got usb, got peanut to help, got the cops to be lenient. W day
[5:17:29] h0lk1: jason has better plans tbh, eugene just wants the chaos haha
[5:17:30] azh314: always have a backup, eugene doesnt care if he gets caught
[5:17:30] darkpwnz: KEKW
[5:17:33] VaeelL: Eugene plan is to get a felon for all the family LUL
[5:17:34] RayRey22: vader like the unknown
[5:17:34] Shivie78: @Acie how was the expirience for you doing the hostage ?
[5:17:34] x_juiceman: That‚Äôs what Jason keeps saying to Eugene about planning
[5:17:34] Alonort00: The cooldown makes u be like that
[5:17:35] midzito: its 100% up to her what to do in that spot. if it was moonmoon/esfand u were done
[5:17:35] Roro_____: tbf it was momos cars fault, any good car and the first swap would have been enough
[5:17:37] Villenthessis: Shoutout to Client (Peanut) and TheRealArab (Momo) for the getaway drivers peepoClap
[5:17:37] h116_: Clayton needs to work on his hacking. he was choking hard on the 1st hack. but he was doing OK on the 2nd
[5:17:37] joyoruz: too clean vee EZ
[5:17:38] n_loba: but at least you showed up guys good job acieWIGGLE
[5:17:38] Tuga_cef: @42arc truuue
[5:17:41] crazyiitopii: The headache was lucky but Vee friends saved the day
[5:17:43] loekup: Vader just wants to play aswell, a super clean getaway is not always fun for RP
[5:17:45] davedjb4: But last time riai got cought
[5:17:45] darkpwnz: Thats was main problem and there so many better swaps too
[5:17:46] Absinto1: if they would have tased you u could have tried bech trial i think and cop r scared of DAPs right now
[5:17:49] proleteric: Should have had a better second car!

[5:17:49] simmeringteapot: it depends on the cop, not all of them are that lenient
[5:17:51] shurno: Got your adrenaline pumping tho Vee :D
[5:17:53] Roro_____: everyone needs green
[5:17:54] mrbouda1: momo should've went left so the cop cant see you guys
[5:17:55] SlampyFanBoi: vade3 vade2 vade1
[5:17:55] nuhbinho: cops are cucked by the no ramming rules, "headache" is an easy way for them to dodge getting in trouble for it if they want to
[5:17:57] blackdoos: @Roro_____ but v told him to come in the glendale
[5:17:57] LOLanthony_: @Acie you did great for "managing" your first heist though
[5:17:57] momzzyy: W heist
[5:17:58] misemivice: @Roro_____ true
[5:18:00] emrhys95: I think momo ain't even a bad driver but the boat ahh glendale is a big nerf kekw
[5:18:01] donbena_: @begixdxd cops get called W chasing way too easily
[5:18:01] elgoonies: everyone needs green
[5:18:02] TopicTech: what does the job say on the computer jow
[5:18:04] Raivolver: company only one with green i guess
[5:18:12] evkay: Think Jason said they company has green
[5:18:14] mavericks312: I would help peanut and cg over the company
[5:18:14] Blazentreez: company has green
[5:18:16] nonnahshannon: criminussy
[5:18:18] crazyiitopii: I love how Clayton dropped the JP comment before leaving laundromat
[5:18:21] MrMingy: how many colors full rainbow?
[5:18:22] Tueur562: I wonder if you ahve the company color would they trade 2 for 1
[5:18:22] furious_mike: And good to have a 3rd driver.. as backup
[5:18:23] b00st3d_aud1: @roro_____ company needed violet
[5:18:26] ConnorDangerCash: eugene doesn‚Äôt always make the best tactical decisions. he said Glendale would be fine and thought just you 3 would be enough. he‚Äôs great content but his planning needs work
[5:18:27] Blazentreez: they might need blue
[5:18:27] fishiegoblublub: yall need a consistent second driver imo, go ask a racing sim driver to start playing the game lol
[5:18:29] andrefvm: The job is not the problem, that is the easy party, you only need to get the getaway planned
[5:18:29] mectuka: sign up for roof job?
[5:18:31] h0lk1: funniest heist yet, momo drove the wrong way
[5:18:31] Dumi90: yea the only problem was the car
[5:18:32] bitshiz: For Eugene this is like a small robbery.
[5:18:34] eyebetx: HOLLY CRAP THIS AD IS SO LOUD!
[5:18:35] tayda_wy: Do roofruning
[5:18:35] johnnycash1918: company need only purple
[5:18:35] majin29: how this room loading liek that ?
[5:18:38] Mr_Tvi: You guys 5 manned it. It worked out great.
[5:18:41] PRE5TO_: i think that cop got lucky and rammed over the barrier
[5:18:42] SlampyFanBoi: chat your too invested if you care about the dongles :)
[5:18:42] walrus_from_space: usually they dont chase the second car ive noticed
[5:18:43] lore_angel_: i'm just impressed you all got away
[5:18:46] fuqcue: @eyebetx WhoAsked
[5:18:46] M0hkofantti: Also the highway drop for you 2 to the bike would have been fine too
[5:18:46] nullfoobar: Who is Momo?
[5:18:47] evilmoose__: bee has better connection than Jason now
[5:18:49] Lud_X0: tier 3 Pog
[5:18:50] h0lk1: momo drove the wrong way
[5:18:50] gijojoe: I wish she was like the girl in pulp fiction robbing the dinner
[5:18:51] iHarsh29: didn't we robb dabloons?
[5:18:51] AddyAdam: all he has to do is report his car stolen before the heist
[5:18:53] GregorGDD: ppl in the gang need to start getting lessons from Eugene for getaway driving
[5:18:55] evilmoose__: *Vee
[5:18:55] elgoonies: momo sani?
[5:18:56] AiSOtv_: chat meta is insane
[5:18:57] Raivolver: link up with gramps first?
[5:19:02] FRAlex010: you only can do a t3
[5:19:03] Strifes_de: sani with omo?
[5:19:03] m331o: who named this Clayton clay kekw
[5:19:03] dnlinhares: is like if is not supose to happen, and happened because of scuff, its normal to try to help the rp, and get it back again, same in headpops, if you headpop in a chase you are suposed to go get to the car and continue the chase
[5:19:08] quietesfaye: yeah, but when you get a swap for two people, theyre going to focus that one
[5:19:13] Ace1507: swaped target is mostly the VIP thats why they focus
[5:19:13] Phasehero: CLAYTON WAS WHITE LIKE NUNU!!!
[5:19:15] Kenjack1984: yeah he souldnt wear that outfit
[5:19:17] SinsHD: @nullfoobar thatrealarab
[5:19:18] sunnyskies23: Eugene low key screwed u cus he played down the car for momo
[5:19:18] SlayerMuff: @Acie did you hear the cop callouts in laundromat?
[5:19:19] N0Ne123: Clayton having his G6 ID on him was hilarious
[5:19:19] ConnorDangerCash: yeah because he was in the back so they figured he was the vault guy
[5:19:20] cir111: @Acie cops say on radio focus clay
[5:19:20] simmeringteapot: Vee you need to practice getaway driving
[5:19:24] AFFABLE__: Eugene always plays for the rp content he will never straight up lose the cops he likes the content of the chase.
[5:19:24] crazyiitopii: Normally you wouldn't get away from that but yall stayed composed
[5:19:25] SlampyFanBoi: loved how you both forgot to use the radio :)
[5:19:27] Terrous10: they knew Clayton was the one in the back
[5:19:30] Olvi12: @ConnorDangerCash, always having a foolproof plan gets boring. He wants action
[5:19:32] emrhys95: Vee got dem connects that saved the day
[5:19:35] Thunderpint: Vee has all the gangsters as friends I love it
[5:19:36] fate024: I think its cause hes the hacker
[5:19:36] 42arc: u need lockpick blueprint at this point
[5:19:37] walrus_from_space: vee has an army of men ready at her disposal GIGACHAD

[5:19:52] MaxaMinor: Need your g6 uniform
[5:19:52] fate024: I think its cause of the hack @Acie

[5:20:04] RagoDK: they come from hacking room so its easy
[5:20:06] donbena_: and they probably realized who was hacking
[5:20:07] twobladez: you guys should all wear the same oputfit

[5:24:11] Capt4inJuli: going right was the worst choice
[5:24:11] eFiend: OOO: they guessed it before you did it and a cop was driving under there after that
[5:24:11] momzzyy: its very common swap spot
[5:24:13] quietesfaye: @ConnorDangerCash trueee, but I think PD cant use voices againts crims anyway, only civs can

[5:54:54] otakublakk: bout to be like how nunu and cam were
[5:55:02] Capt4inJuli: why even car swap just park a few fast cars in front of laundry beforehand
[5:55:09] joyoruz: but technically vee is on all of the heists so the real mveep
[5:55:09] heyzus242: if momo had a good car it would've been gg from the swap

[5:55:49] Syntai_dev: I liked his confidence. You were panicing like crazy and Momo was just like: Let me cook, I got this :D
[5:55:53] misemivice: I think it all went wrong and only luck saved you all
[5:55:56] ViolentRoy: hopefully they get to a point again like in 3.0 that there wasnt so many headaches
[5:55:58] ediblemaster: @capt4injuli the police have to take a long detour to get to the swap car
[5:55:58] Tenivir: mectuka think cops mostly left him alone since they knew he wasnt actually in the laundromat
[5:56:00] ashleyferns: You guys were CAUGHT if the cops weren't nice
[5:56:01] shivang1497: yeah but still should have been prepared for it even if not expecting
[5:56:06] otakublakk: he deff did

[5:56:31] VoidanceMusic: it was awesome

[9:25:13] Praskle: yea, but you cant afford to lose the little stars you get
[9:25:16] vazeline__: @mavericks312 The devs killed the war between CG and The Company and it was entertaining. Entertainment should always be priority here.
[9:25:18] mavericks312: @vazeline__ what I will say is there next update needs to be on a biggers scale ppl are over the grinding phase viewership even shows rhat

[9:26:23] eruhen17: Could it be related to what kind of items you hand in? Like bicycles and stuff?
[9:26:27] 0livesleft: How did people get 300 so quickly
[9:26:42] vazeline__: @mavericks312 Yeah updates need to contain more and civ jobs need to be merged to encourage people to rp for more money.
[9:26:43] ashleyferns: It'll be so worth once you're 300
[9:26:46] Tenivir: 0livesleft it was all they did for weeks
[9:26:46] Dumi90: @0livesleft took them more than 1 month of 10hours + grinds not quick

[9:30:22] jas3y: so anywhere from 30 mins to 3 hours then
[9:30:23] BoomerPaw: don't wake me up UltraMad
