[0:31:21] Redtwintails: peepoShy
[0:31:26] LogicWeasel: omg, when Cornwood said "right there" LUL I could feel how mad McNulty was
[0:32:03] sticks26: Communicating with cops immediately around them?
[0:32:10] Redtwintails: it was for the officer right next to him at the time taking a turn
[0:32:16] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: if only there was the ass air unit lol
[0:32:21] ruttdog21: wouldnt be suprised if there back in the city at this point lol
[0:32:46] xMistressMayhem: Gun on scene people need to know locations
[0:32:50] LogicWeasel: yep, gotta break the others of bad habits.  gotta lock it in
[0:32:58] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: @xmistressmayhem amen
[0:33:00] BooksBlanketsandTea: @sticks26 even if you're talking to people next to you, it's better to use clear coms. Easier to understand for people there And people on radio
[0:33:08] MrPhoNoodle: its like being in a BR and calling out 'enemy there'
[0:33:12] VSDuck: tbf doesn't matter if it's main or not "here" means fucking nothing
[0:33:18] sticks26: But cops are immediately around them is my point. They will comm exact location afterwards like they did
[0:33:47] graceturner1017: graceturner1017 subscribed at Tier 1.

[0:35:22] Switchblade142: @VSDuck Ehh he almost got kidnapped and was scuffed, stressful situation it happens.
[0:36:26] BooksBlanketsandTea: @Switchblade142 it does and it's not a huge deal, but the point is to practice clear coms so that it's second nature and even under stress it's what you go to. Better for everyone (especially in emergencies it can help save officer lives)
[0:36:58] DieterK: chat does blackwell stream??

[4:24:17] Despoiler98: Sooty Cares, come on thats her sister
[4:24:48] SerrikVorrik: O has a violent crime now right? She couldn't even join the pd right?
[4:24:51] xMistressMayhem: the pd in general does care
[4:24:52] JediJacob_: kian, pd, and sooty care a lot about O
[4:25:25] Steelhuf: Beric wants to bring back old officers.
[4:25:51] SerrikVorrik: I could see her joining another mc i guess only time will tell
[4:25:51] Angel_ofMercy: shes family by proxy. thats your girl so they will look out for her for you
[4:25:53] zack12359: reminds me of early 3.0 with dominators
[4:25:55] TheBFG_01: hearing her talk yesterday about saying she missed the chaos, I was half expecting her to say she’s been thinking about hanging around with Dundee
[4:25:59] Tabah: If O joined PD would they be allowed to be in shift 2? Does PD have rules like that?
[4:26:25] xMistressMayhem: Ngl thats kinda a bad idea Imo bringing back old officers
[4:26:41] Crazith: I could go both ways on old and new cops
[4:26:45] JediJacob_: power puff girls Sadge
[4:27:05] OShagHennasy: hop on siege
[4:27:05] Tabah: IRL, couples usually aren't allowed on the same shift. Wasn't sure if LSP had the same kinda rules
[4:27:14] Schefenator: i have found it hard watching streams where people have the same character as 3.0.
[4:27:22] amamurse: would the pd create a new PD tow and have O run it maybe?
[4:27:29] DiaBeetusKoby: @oshaghennasy how about no..
[4:28:04] DiaBeetusKoby: she gonna join the clowns watch
[4:28:04] SerrikVorrik: I will say I don't even know much of the crim path Custard is about the only i'm watching now so it's kind of nice
[4:28:05] Tabah: Oh, no I'm not a cop IRL. Army Vet and IT extraordinaire but not a cop LOL
[4:28:08] Crazith: what I imagine is bring the old cops in only for academies for training but they have to first understand the current SOP and not the SOPs from 3.0
[4:28:18] Asmodean01: Some people just fall too in love with their characters, see it a lot in D&D
[4:28:22] amamurse: O’s pd tow and chaos service, how can we help you?

[4:29:49] amamurse: I agree, new server, new city, new characters. Brings some new life in, creates new role play
[4:29:50] Crazith: no they are not fully hired, just the training day to help the with the core ropes nothing else, but again my opinion not my choice
[4:30:00] Tabah: I've only ever watched you in 4.0 and it's been fantastic to see. I'm a little apprehensive of seeing 3.0 cops
[4:30:33] SerrikVorrik: how did the audit roleplay even start
[4:30:38] Steelhuf: for instance he wants dark back for dispatch
[4:30:39] JediJacob_: i love svenson cause he doesn't take the bs
[4:30:39] xMistressMayhem: Tbh the SoP's have changed since 3.0 wo it wont help
[4:30:46] DiaBeetusKoby: also here’s the thing.. Custy made a new cop and is training.. you can train with a new cop

[4:32:28] Tabah: Oh I assumed you were a 3.0 cop, or at least did a lot of research with how much you know and how good of a teacher McNulty is. Just not familiar with 3.0 SoP.
[4:32:36] warmachine89: lmao Kirk
[4:33:07] DiaBeetusKoby: today’ll probably wind up being a 12 hour shift ltcustOK ima be an eepy boy in the morning

[4:33:42] SerrikVorrik: the audit was great RP
[4:33:51] Tabah: @VSDuck Oh yeah Kian is a new character for 4.0. Who did he play in 3.0?
[4:33:52] JediJacob_: @DiaBeetusKoby just sleep 4head
