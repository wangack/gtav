[1:27:12] alphawolfgrave: You might need a better axe
[1:27:59] jimothy64: Nah you've gotten the next tier up at least with the basic axe.. I think its literally luck of the draw on the trees
[1:28:48] saturneighteen: big fan
[1:29:06] connect_duck69: @saturneighteen me too
[1:29:14] saturneighteen: can you make Juno a wheelchair?

[1:30:12] Makaveli079: nakkiPhone Tobii.. Tessa need a wheelchair
[1:30:23] EezyLivin: especially getting pulled out and beaten by a local, lol

[1:30:58] alpacalunchuwu: we got snow
[1:30:58] distractfulilly: It was funny seeing you hit doors with the nightstick to open them
[1:31:02] SaberWarrior1: I am wondering why you don't have them, they seem to have gotten rid of so many things that you had in 3.0 for what seems like no reason. nakkiHm
[1:31:36] alpacalunchuwu: sending snow ur way nikkida
[1:32:03] jimothy64: Wheelchairs return, but now they have a manual transmission for no reason :P

[1:32:57] SaberWarrior1: @jimothy64 how fast would they go? nakkiHm
[1:33:06] Chiracho: omg.. a wheelchair with a lil 2 stroke on it and a shifter KEKW
[1:33:48] darthdin: didn't 3.0 wheelchairs go superfast?
[1:34:08] jimothy64: Higher torque, lower top speed.. they don't need to go nearly 30 on flat ground but they need to be able to go up any paved hill they encounter for QoL
[1:34:10] Makaveli079: an automatic wheelchair nakkiNodders
[1:34:34] SaberWarrior1: nakkiHm maybe make it an option for the clothing store, or something like that, so that you don't have to get out of it when doing things. nakkiHm
[1:34:57] Chiracho: my sister used to have an electric one and those things give me ptsd, she used to turn up the speed and ram my shins if i annoyed her KEKW
[1:35:12] molotov_michelle: Lol
[1:35:14] jimothy64: To be fair, you can be handed things while in a vehicle now so there's very few remaining reasons you'd have to get out @saberwarrior1
[1:35:42] Makaveli079: nakkiPhone Tobii.. Tessa need a wheelchair, but she‚Äôs lazy and want a motor powered one that can pop wheelies
[1:36:36] davelecook: what is Tessa trying to make
[1:36:41] JoeayIV: stairs
[1:36:47] JoeayIV: to start her furniture empire
[1:36:52] JoeayIV: and by empire
[1:36:54] JoeayIV: i mean her fucking house
[1:36:59] Makaveli079: nakkiHappyClap

[1:37:27] jimothy64: It's a little odd that you'll always need the lowest tier of lumber. You'd think you could substitute the higher quality stuff in

[2:00:15] Chiracho: i feel a group with everyone having their own car is more effective for this tbh
[2:00:34] jimothy64: It's the drive that I don't understand. Why do you have to go all the way to the far side of the city to "finish" the planks...
[2:00:40] davelecook: nakkiDerp but where is the stairs going , up or down ?

[2:32:29] davelecook: yup
[2:35:17] vipersummer: longer
[2:35:35] vipersummer: you were at an hour and ten minutes before the sewer adventure
[2:37:40] jimothy64: I feel like, moving that one city waypoint anywhere north of 68 would make it 1000√ó better
[2:38:14] samzun97: Side quest completed!
[2:38:18] davelecook: they still have to get decent profits from it or everyone gonna go work for more lucrative stuff
[2:39:05] jimothy64: There's a few yards in Harmony that would be just as believable to use.. like the one on the corner of 68 and Joshua.. there's probably a couple of Grapeseed spots too
[2:39:28] Coomgar: @davelecook but thats the whole point they have to do all of this and then charge an arm and a leg and they only make a decent profit its not like they price gouge just cause they can
[2:39:53] davelecook: I know nakkiSip
[2:40:30] davelecook: Tessa jumpy today
[2:40:35] jimothy64: Also, maybe combine a couple of those steps at the actual yard.. the ones where you take a thing out of the inventory only to then put it back in the same spot.. just make that one step
[2:40:40] stephber: anyone know if the railroad idea some had every took off?
[2:41:11] StreamElements: Feel free to join my Discord flock, 5000 members and growing! https://discordapp.com/invite/nakkida
[2:41:16] davelecook: like send mats by train
[2:41:25] stephber: some wanted to get the northern RR lines open to send wood down to the docks
[2:41:39] JoeayIV: okay but like
[2:41:42] jimothy64: See that only works for selling. If you want them for yourself that doesn't speed anything up
[2:41:46] JoeayIV: what if you just put a turbo in the bison?
[2:41:52] 80sHairMetalFan: nakkiPantsu
[2:42:11] JoeayIV: if Donnie and Cusso can put a turbo on the packers

[2:44:25] darthdin: what came first, chicken or egg?
[2:44:39] scott99901: tessa is so strong FeelsStrongMan
[2:44:45] stephber: Ferst is neither a chicken or egg, darthdin
[2:44:59] jimothy64: But yeah, get rid of the redundant steps, make that drive less insane, and then Lumber is pretty much sorted.
[2:45:14] dinoroaria: Crafting and Mining or something, idk.
[2:46:44] jimothy64: It's the "take the wood out of this station, then put it back in the same station" that bothers me.. like, just skip that?
[2:47:09] davelecook: simplified
[2:47:43] vipersummer: it would  have to be major tweaks... an hour and a half to make stairs in a game designed for RP interactions with others is outrageous
[2:48:30] davelecook: hold a second , is there less poney in front the tv or my eyes betray me
[2:48:30] Chiracho: is there an option to pay to speed it up? Kappa
[2:48:59] jimothy64: See I don't think it needs to be major. It needs several small tweaks. So much of that time is playing inventory simulator and then the drive to the docks and back..
[2:49:12] OrestesTheSloth: A lot of work for a few staircases.

[3:05:44] davelecook: magic
[3:05:45] DJayEnzyme: maybe it will error when it gets to the end of the timer?
[3:05:47] jimothy64: But you added more low after starting it because you didn't empty the truck. The math still doesn't math though
[3:05:47] Coomgar: BOGO
[3:05:47] ThatSoKyuRo: magic ü™Ñ
[3:05:56] davelecook: nakkiShrug
[3:06:08] DJayEnzyme: @jimothy64 she had 7 left in the truck to grab
[3:06:08] BorninRainbows: tessa is magic
[3:06:10] SaberWarrior1: will it just say not enough materials?
[3:06:29] AmberHaelo: We've not enough pylons!
[3:06:54] samzun97: Can you click the low quality to check of its a "or" button
[3:07:01] davelecook: Tessa use a glicht now she can craft with invisible mats nakkiSip
[3:07:34] samzun97: True
[3:07:38] TheJRoller: does it pull the mats when its qued or at the end?
[3:07:48] QuesoCommander: I assume it will just fail when the timer runs out
[3:07:50] DJayEnzyme: it doesnt seem to take the materials until its finished not when you queue it
[3:08:06] Arexian: so it's not a bug , you can start the craft but at the end of the timer it gonna say " not enought materials "
[3:08:49] jimothy64: I feel like it should say that before the timer starts, surely..
[3:09:02] Arexian: it's so during the timer you can try to gather the material you missing yes
[3:09:58] Arexian: yeah if you want furniture you will need more than 1 bench xD
[3:10:10] ThatSoKyuRo: shopping list need more benches üìù
[3:10:32] Arexian: do you want to know how long it take to make a High Quality Furniture ?
[3:11:03] Arexian: last time i saw someone craft one it was 1h for crafting one
[3:11:18] Chiracho: i wonder if you could make furniture on the other crafting table and just move the blueprint to each one to start the process
[3:11:21] vipersummer: why are you acting shocked
[3:11:25] jimothy64: Start the timer, shoot a cop, be out of prison before it's done
[3:11:28] OrestesTheSloth: Set it and forget it I guess
[3:11:38] Arexian: unless they changed it since it's an hour xD
[3:12:03] TheJRoller: at least put a mini game in it or something
[3:12:41] Arexian: see it said " Failed to check 50x plank" in the top right corner
[3:12:56] jimothy64: Boils down to the same issue I have with the entire furniture system. Its applying the same barriers and hurdles to purely cosmetic aesthetic items that apply to mechanically advantageous items.
[3:13:34] ApocAFK: Maybe someone queued it and went to sleep
[3:14:17] vipersummer: its probably the ones you get in drops that decay
[3:14:21] jimothy64: Like, these hurdles are great for GPUs, guns, etc.. but there's almost no reason to make it this hard to get a cosmetic sofa
[3:15:21] AmberHaelo: Hey, cosmetic sofas are far out. Outathisworld. Superfresh. All the slang since the 70's. They should be difficult.
[3:15:53] Chiracho: KEKW
[3:15:55] JoeayIV: yea Tessa is a menace
[3:16:11] Chiracho: Tessa imagining the granite as cornwoods head
[3:16:36] ThatSoKyuRo: walkie-talkies degrade way to fast for 2k
[3:16:37] jimothy64: Idk maybe there's some secret "you have a comfortable home" heist
[3:17:39] AmberHaelo: I don't trust cl0wn games!
[3:18:05] jimothy64: Almost pitted into the pumps...
[3:18:40] Arexian: and the funny part for high end furniture they need high quality plank that you get from " Unicorn tree " (it's a 100% quality from what i remember) and if you find one that is growing it can take up to 1h30 to get ready if it just started growing and you get 30 plank from it
[3:19:06] AmberHaelo: Do rumple strips actually wake  up sleeping drivers?
[3:19:20] vipersummer: again, you had people say doing lumber and furnuiture makes them not want to wake up ever again, why are you scoked
[3:19:32] vipersummer: shocked
[3:19:48] jimothy64: Because people lie and exaggerate all the time in RP? @vipersummer
[3:19:53] ThatSoKyuRo: go see sani if you lost stars?
[3:19:59] retrowolf0498: No wonder why high quality items cost an arm and a leg. Because it takes about half the day to just get the materials for them

[3:47:52] Archaeologist8: It is also Cornwood
[3:48:00] zalgo2028: He going to sleep with the fishes lol
[3:48:00] jimothy64: For that dolphin to be full grown its at a minimum 5yo, so any rangers that raised it were during Tessa's reign.. its a direct dig lol

[4:10:01] QuesoCommander: wonder what would be the cheapest thing to make that might still have a use when decorating
[4:10:34] QuesoCommander: it doesn't even seem like lumber rep matters much at all, not like the other jobs at least where it's drastically better at higher tiers
