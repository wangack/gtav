[0:32:11] kingofthebeats: @MagiCaeGirl I mean you just have to know they need the money
[0:32:20] FastEddeh: @MagiCaeGirl my guess is that it is pooled for lawsuits and is collected in some way from court
[0:32:30] FastEddeh: and from taxes
[0:33:10] MagiCaeGirl: @FastEddeh i could see that, but 40mil is a lot to have accrued during 4.0s time.
[0:33:49] FastEddeh: yeah but thats not knowing the amount of money they started with and over 2/3 months of crime
[0:34:00] thalwegg: the reality is that the city account is the black hole that needs to absorb money to balance the server and try to stave off inflation
[0:34:01] kingofthebeats: @MagiCaeGirl They didn't start from 0 man
