[0:47:00] oskiteleo: get the current video link, I see the name in the title tho and ik I can search it, just doing more work in my quest of laziness
[0:48:35] AdmiralAlkex: I don't think you can get the link, take the name from the title or extension and google for it
[0:48:50] oskiteleo: rip
[0:49:05] oskiteleo: thanks for trying

[1:51:00] rorchach_test: @CaveTroll it was either 7 or 1
[1:51:10] CaveTroll: y'all can add videos lol
[1:51:32] CaveTroll: why is that an emote, what chaos is this LUL
[1:51:34] rorchach_test: i know but i just got here2mins ago LUL
[1:51:52] pinewood_mist: bobaChoke
[1:51:56] rorchach_test: where
[1:52:02] T2Needles: It's classic chat to not read numbers/titles NODDERS its why series don't really work on Cinema unless someone's constantly monitoring and adding the correct next video
[1:52:16] rorchach_test: hmmm.. that isn't an emote...
[1:52:29] CaveTroll: oh if you have 7tv what and lol are emotes
[1:52:57] rorchach_test: yeah, hrry has them
[1:53:06] pinewood_mist: or just enable the 7tv option in bttv
[1:55:01] Newbranch: Maybe episode 6 was hard to add. The bot can be really finicky about finding what you want.
[1:56:35] T2Needles: enter the youtube vid ID and it'll always appear unless the videos length is over 1 hour or there are unwanted people in the video.
[1:57:05] T2Needles: or vids too recent, but that's not going to happen with this series.

[2:06:00] Akhawais: Yeah was going to ask how things have been
[2:06:28] Akhawais: Not sure what happened last night though someone had to ping the mods
[2:06:37] rorchach_test: have noticed it's detecting buffering loops etc
[2:07:14] rorchach_test: from what  i've seen it's fixing itself
[2:07:37] Newbranch: Definitely performing way above it's average.

[2:11:21] rorchach_test: hryLafExceptInPain
[2:13:24] T2Needles: Can we get a video database update now that the rebuffering fix is working quite well? Plotge
[2:18:01] Akhawais: Sure yeah will do that for tomorrow
[2:18:29] honeybutterbread: Goodluck! I hope everything goes smoothly

[2:32:38] Chapter_Master_Moloc: oh my god this episode is 6 hours
[2:37:01] Ziffer777: It's just the stream vod
[2:39:22] T2Needles: This is what happens when we allow videos that go over 1 hr and 30 minutes, a 6 hr video gets voted in because chat doesn't pay attention to what they're voting on NOPERS

[2:39:24] Chapter_Master_Moloc: no yeah its just wild that a 6 hour video was picked for yogscinema
[2:47:35] Wyrd_Oh: Mkay, if we can get a consensus, I think the mods will be happy to skip this one
[2:47:38] Wyrd_Oh: 6 hours is a bit much
[2:48:59] Wyrd_Oh: So yeah, sound off if you'd rather skip it

[2:52:13] T2Needles: Mod's aren't actively watching so they'd need to be contacted in the Discord.
[2:52:55] Wyrd_Oh: Yup yup, was planning on pinging them if folks didn't want this to keep going
[2:52:58] Vashts6583: Stability?  In my yogs cinema?  Say it ain't so!
[2:54:14] Wyrd_Oh: https://clips.twitch.tv/UglyFaintWolfArgieB8-ZN4_PpMZtpeilEHN

[2:54:53] T2Needles: I'd argue a soundoff isn't even necessary since most viewers aren't actively watching, so anyone who is actively watching suddenly gets punished to watch a 6hr long video due to ONLY 2 votes.
[2:57:00] Wyrd_Oh: Fair point
[2:58:31] Z0eff: euh
[2:58:45] Wyrd_Oh: Praise Z0eff! <3
[2:58:53] T2Needles: There used to be a video length filter in place specifically for situations like this. But they removed it in Cinema 2 because "people" wanted to watch longer videos. "People" being those who DON'T watch Cinema on a regular basis Sadge
[2:59:01] T2Needles: I hope they re-implement the filter

[3:23:57] philipov: has the database been updated in the last two years?
[3:24:04] honeybutterbread: there is ped scream i have no idea what it is
[3:24:27] Wyrd_Oh: It was done earlier this year and will be done again soon
[3:24:39] T2Needles: Akh said he would update it tomorrow when i asked earlier if we can get it updated now that the rebuffering fix is working as intended
[3:25:20] T2Needles: so up to date videos should be coming soon Plotge
[3:25:34] philipov: oh sweet, there's a rebuffering fix finally?!
[3:25:49] Wyrd_Oh: HAHGA
[3:25:52] Wyrd_Oh: The timing
[3:25:53] philipov: I swear we just cursed it
[3:26:00] Sanyiel: @philipov Yep, this is the fix on screen LUL
[3:26:04] T2Needles: there it is in action POGGERS
[3:26:21] philipov: gotta admit, that's better than it was before
[3:27:29] Wyrd_Oh: Very nice that it just picks up and continues where it was

[3:30:22] honeybutterbread: Hold
[3:30:26] Wyrd_Oh: spinners
[3:30:29] honeybutterbread: it may recover maybe
[3:30:29] philipov: so it can't always fix it, but it at least tries to reboot itself
[3:30:32] Sanyiel: Give it a minute NODDERS
[3:30:47] honeybutterbread: there
[3:30:48] Sanyiel: There we go
[3:30:53] Wyrd_Oh: zoeyGoblin
[3:31:07] philipov: do we now know what causes the rebuffering?
[3:31:33] philipov: serious question, is duncan drunk or high?
[3:31:39] philipov: who in their right mind binds jump to T
[3:31:53] Wyrd_Oh: ¯\(°_o)/¯
[3:32:07] Sanyiel: Wasn't it the super jump he bound to T rather than normal jump?
[3:32:17] philipov: oh, dash?
[3:32:27] HumptyHamp: mega jump IIRC
[3:32:35] Sanyiel: idk, I was only half paying attention LUL
[3:32:49] HumptyHamp: it's at least one of them LUL
[3:34:16] Wyrd_Oh: This might be just one of those vids it has trouble with sadly
[3:35:34] philipov: I wonder if it wouldn't be more effective to change voting to be at the start of a video, and fully download the next video while the current one is playing. Then, there shouldn't be any buffering issues. The entire thing would be buffered.
[3:35:54] ComradeWolf: is this vault hunters
[3:36:02] philipov: yes
[3:36:10] ComradeWolf: lol

[3:38:09] Wyrd_Oh: Honestly I don't know what the exact setup is for Cinema, it could be that something else is running on the server that is grabbing bandwidth that causes the issues too
[3:57:52] philipov: as far as I recall, it's less a matter of something else running there, as the PC being really bad and barely being able to handle this one thing.
