[9:41:19] rocket_s6: @UberHaxorNova The southside needs to be kept in check to not fuck themselves over, so maybe a 3 lab cartel could force them to an accord?
[9:41:19] Syestira: @Tru7hyDv8 at the same time speedy wants siz to match their offer, that in itself is not good for siz

[10:02:39] wondervviener: wow
[10:02:39] ROWDY_AU: 50/50 that is 15400
[10:02:42] CoconutCow2: @itslavelle That is the lost
[10:02:43] TossedOnion: @itslavelle not CB its the 3rd lab TPFufun
[10:02:45] thawaif: lab rental or wrench plan may be better than this plan.
[10:02:45] morratiz: for the time put in that's pathetic lmao
[10:02:45] Rooberz27: 9+10=21
[10:02:48] MIKEBL0CK: @oxygenhomie it will actually be a quick stack, CB will just say they're going to take out the 3rd lab lol
[10:02:48] freestyle2100: cb strain selling 540ish atm
[10:02:51] that_tibetan_dude: Convince him
[10:02:52] VaderGeist: so speedy becoming siz and saab's partner?
[10:02:55] massive_legend420: lab rental EZ

[10:02:59] itslavelle: Ohh my bad I’m just tuning in
[10:03:00] DrZombieGamer: yall would raise it i think. yalk are 343 atm right? @uberhaxornova
[10:03:01] WaffleCoffeeTV: nino really fucked his boys over with the misinformation and half truths... right now you and cb could have all 3 labs and be on the edge of 3 different 90% strains...
[10:03:02] dionnevw: Can you not also 50/50 the cost of the cook (12k)? Between the vagos and you?
[10:03:04] rimestyle: @bier_und_bratwurst I’ll flip you tomatoGrease
[10:03:04] pizzA_z: This shit about to get HEAVY LMAOOOOOOO
[10:03:05] Hento: we got that meeting with Rudy @UberHaxorNova too KEKW
[10:03:05] SacredAngelCake: The lost lab is the real big issue here. They will eventually mess with everything when they realize the actual profits for meth after they stop their test runs.
[10:03:05] Nightbot: We? modCheck I didn't see you in there. uhnHm Tell us what uhnYou are doing in NoPixel uhnNotes
[10:03:06] tally_one: Regardless it’s not a margin that’s worth the 9’s in prison... uhnSuffer

[10:03:09] KFC_LUVR_420: uhnMeta
[10:03:11] zrialf: depends on how much he sells to other peeps
[10:03:17] witsseven: That’s if rep doesn’t goes down LUL
[10:03:18] squoogelol: he will need supply everyday to keep his rep up
[10:03:18] Drax_1X: Actually.... I though he wants a split of total so.... your cost per bag is 125 for a 3 bag cook.... 583/2 = 291/bag -125 cost= $15,984 profit
[10:03:18] Ultimatestrife: it goes up fast, just need to keep the supply coming
[10:03:20] Dezerman: just freeze the lab and let the 2 labs go at it lol.
[10:03:21] ThisIsChev: this is Taco math all over again uhnSuffer

[10:03:29] POCHY__: You Should negotiate on by purity the higher the more money (Idk if it can work that way)
[10:03:34] wondervviener: KEKW
[10:03:35] dominusmessorem: It's more around 5k per cook
[10:03:36] Paradoxd: If you could make shitty meth for cheap it might work out
[10:03:36] The2b: @dionnevw the deal speedy proposed also splits the cook
[10:03:39] tally_one: Couple thousand dollars for life in prison uhnSuffer
[10:03:39] tranquil120: pay the lost out and take the lab?
[10:03:42] J0HNJ: meth is a curse
[10:03:42] Xantos94: god damn KEKW
[10:03:47] Sax850: calling the boys for what?
[10:03:48] SacredAngelCake: honestly, take over the lost lab and sell it to some other group who is willing to play ball.
[10:03:54] Div_the_Penguin: internal drama monkaW
[10:03:57] POCHY__: Oh
[10:04:04] Paradoxd: Yeah im saying if you could make shitty stuff for less than 12k per cook
[10:04:07] dionnevw: @the2b ah my bad then
[10:04:07] sungiant_: toilet meth being different would be cool
[10:04:12] morratiz: the devs really didnt crunch the numbers on this very long lmao
[10:04:13] Ultimatestrife: it's better to make the higher purity all the time though?
[10:04:14] InevitableChoice: monkaHmm
[10:04:14] CinderOfFlames: NODDERS
[10:04:16] ROWDY_AU: sorry 20400 each
[10:04:17] astrotigs: I get all the fun meth "wars" but I'm confused how everyone is underestimating how quickly CB can maximise their purity. They have fuckin' NERDS on the case KEKW
[10:04:17] A_j_a_x_: just a loss of profits tho
[10:04:19] Ultimatestrife: for the sale profits
[10:04:25] TheRarePotato: uhnHm
[10:04:25] Sax850: can't he just pay 12k only for to get his rep up?
[10:04:25] A_j_a_x_: thats basically throwing away 1 cook
[10:04:25] dammitfawker: have vagos focus on just lost - you have someone sell yours. if 92  base was 300, youd make just over 5k each after removing 12k cook
[10:04:25] squoogelol: why cook shitty stuff just cook regular
[10:04:25] tushar828: time to reach out to other groups even if Speedy deal continues. how does it makes sense to keep all eggs in one basket
[10:04:29] SickAuraStudios: just experiment then
[10:04:32] darkemlp: this meth thing is literally survival of the fittest
[10:04:33] dank_memes_kid: shitty stuff is reserved for Rob tho
[10:04:36] Drax_1X: That still don't make sense... better meth still give more profit
[10:04:37] ROWDY_AU: on a 50/50 deal
[10:04:39] ColdDeck45: Hang on to the new batch until you reach a deal. It's your golden goose at the moment. It's the 1st player sellable batch.
[10:04:41] dominusmessorem: I mean there's no real point to make shitty stuff at that point though?
[10:04:42] RaLee33: yeah no point making it bad lol
[10:04:43] 0xygenhomie: there has to be so much we dont know yet..
[10:04:45] ka1o5: + time investment
[10:04:46] Meikai: jiz
[10:04:48] MsAutumnWind: but why cook really good stuff as well if you're not making anything from it
[10:04:50] DrFatix: Give up meth, start a bakery
[10:04:52] jcomia1: PauseChamp
[10:04:52] Crit_c: It's 12k cost no matter what purity you cook
[10:04:54] The2b: if you split the total revenue 50/50, the cook is split too @UberHaxorNova
[10:04:55] yespixelenthusiast: Theres no benefit in making it worse yeah
[10:04:56] AppzmaN: saabHmm
[10:04:57] CoconutCow2: Good deal for speedy LUL

[10:30:24] Olacarn: @tolwenn No? You're thinking about LOCALS not Randos AKA real players.
[10:30:25] HasdrubalLoL: yea idk this meth lab conflict might turn lame really fast with all 3 labs camped and burned by cops
[10:30:31] edietala: Do HoA and The Lost have a history pre 3.0?

[10:31:01] Yokota777: I think it’s best to get war ready and get as many allies as possible to topple the other labs or just get out now if he doesn’t want war. The way this is being set up is leaving almost no middle ground.
[10:31:03] tolwenn: @olacarn people were selling Siz’s strain through burger shot. How is that not selling to ransoms?

[10:32:38] Yokota777: @schnarph Or the alternative is one group gaining complete control over all labs through sheer attrition which is a numbers and good ticket train advantage wins kind of deal.
[10:32:39] A_j_a_x_: what happened to 50 50 speedy peepoSus
[10:32:42] Olacarn: @tolwenn See the thing is that was when the changes weren't in effect. Now that anyone can fuck up the rep if they sell in a certain location, Siz doesn't want that to happen. CB STILL wants that plan.

[10:37:59] MsAutumnWind: @krwpr well that's why Speedy wants to change the deal - the Lost are not charging the 12K for the cook for two cooks, so the cooks will make next to nothing if you can't even get back what you put in
[10:38:03] Ultimatestrife: @six_o_nine lol, Siz didnt even fight
