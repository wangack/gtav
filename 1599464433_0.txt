[6:03:56] mashpotatoes69: put a bike down
[6:03:58] sharkczar: you are at an angle to it when you start
[6:04:02] jj1remix: it's not at a straight angle
[6:04:05] WubbaYuLi: Maybe cos the fence is tilted right?
[6:04:06] sharkczar: it's pushing you to be perpendicular
[6:04:06] grakzo: might need a box truck against the side
[6:04:08] 0xygenhomie: the car squares up with the railing since its angled
[6:04:16] YewW0TM8: Try the other side with more speed
[6:04:20] 0xygenhomie: theres a grassy hill on either side lol
[6:04:38] LeSauceZ: next to the water adds so many rad points tho
