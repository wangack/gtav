[1:22:47] evkay: Even if he can’t do it, he needs to at least try and fail to get used to it
[1:22:50] keeesh: @krispy_w doesnt require 6. 6 is the max

[1:24:04] emrhys95: does vee wanna be a hacker?
[1:24:05] nickswiss: yeah feels like hes just finding ways to force working with the company
[1:24:06] IggleGreen: Or 1 day when the job is up idk
[1:24:11] auxfrog: it’s like a non-argument. Clay didn’t even want to do it bc he was fearing for his truck job
[1:24:17] FRAlex010: i guess sani grind now haha
[1:24:19] adamm220: but i fear theres more pressure on clay now, since they  make him feel like he has something more to prove
[1:24:23] Dysotopia: you are sad Nora is leaving so you are beating up the guys knowing you are stuck with them for a week
[1:24:36] auxfrog: it went from “no we need to worry about Clays truck” to “no he needs to do the job” in an hour lol
