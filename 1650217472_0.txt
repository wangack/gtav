[7:20:54] TheKagrenac: @Tr0LLach Which ones have been active outside of C.U.M.? Other than the PM stuff ages ago SRU is quite and HVTU was claiming to be the most effective for awhile but barely seen. My intent was not to "be an asshole".
[7:20:58] ASomewhatLargeBabyRhino: And if you do it "wrong" thats what court should be great for
[7:20:59] ondema: i agree with you on those points, the exclusivity club aspect of them was an issue, but my counter would be if you want a man hunt isn't it cool being able to go to trained department to assist?
[7:21:01] TheKagrenac: Not everything is a gotcha.
[7:21:06] archfey_: feels kinda cliquey when its gatekept

[7:23:04] Scoobyk: some things like the interceptor being certed makes sense or you would have 12 of them in each chase

[7:24:17] ASomewhatLargeBabyRhino: I think the only problem that COULD come from that is if it messes with ongoing investigation/slowburn, but that doesn't really exist anyway lLUL
[7:24:21] Bigusacokis: and turned out the serial killer wrote down the wrong thing or something

[7:25:02] RickyHavok: @Bigusacokis Yeah he wrote something like Yily instead of Lily KEKW
[7:25:05] hetero_corgi: I can see it from a coordination or training perspective but yeah shouldn't restrict people from taking part
[7:25:12] Sophianom: being the expert department and just being a cop should be able to coexist without gatekeeping anything, apart from vehicle certs
[7:25:29] TheKagrenac: @Dannytsu Fair enough
[7:25:29] BrickSquad: but sounds like there needs to be some gatekeeping or itll be abused like crim things

[7:29:03] Dannytsu: yeah i agree @UberHaxorNova im just saying thats why they have it the way they do, cos cases instantly flop cos of leaks and they get angry
