[1:02:22] TheSpriteReport: TheSpriteReport subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 17 months, currently on a 7 month streak! Game of Thrones is very well made, you're missing out regardless of the ending.  My best advice I can give you - Don't let what you read on the internet influence what you like or dislike before you have seen or experienced it yourself.  Form your own opinions and then focus on what you enjoyed about those things rather than focusing on what you disliked.  You'll be happier in the long run.  Cheers Whippy!
