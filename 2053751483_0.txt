[4:45:01] Frakkles: @TheHugHunter I don't agree. Once you're aware that someone HAS a weapon, using a weapon of your own is more than reasonable.
[4:45:03] ryandale_: thechiefFingle1 thechiefFingle2

[5:36:46] derpz: I’ve been deployed, why aren’t you and penta on nopixel?
[5:36:48] xtheoneandmany: maybe freeze assets for a period then if no t payments show up seize assets
[5:36:51] narvahhh: Maybe you could set up a payment plan for people so they dont get fined 10k at once, at least give them a chance to work it off

[5:37:17] ramski_maru: No they dont
[5:37:18] rojeezee: def not
[5:37:19] DominickPerrero: If they call a deputy
[5:37:19] ZedsFiction: you do have access to MDW though
[5:37:19] Spikee439: @Rem753 but the bounty hunter should get some assets from their capture
[5:37:20] Seetherrr: @Tooots I don't know if anyone has a good solution but currently if you have outstanding fines you dont get any time/fines off when being charged
[5:37:20] FuriousBlizzard: cop friends
[5:37:20] MikeyMike26: That's a government resource.
[5:37:20] KoMiTTeD: we have confiscate vehicle time and fine
[5:37:23] swaghetti77: Should get a cop for that
[5:37:24] Hotot1: Not on the up and up, but some states or out of state
[5:37:24] one_two_x_you730: Most bounty hunters had PD connects though
[5:37:25] Amyoto: @derpz drama. him penta, wiseguy and DW started their own server
[5:37:26] Pexterra: you cant let bh become cops
[5:37:28] woofen: Nopers
[5:37:28] Timmo001: Maybe only at the DMV or something, maybe that gives someone a job
[5:37:29] TheMCA_Police: naa
[5:37:31] Miditron6000: What we do is we usually call a pd friend.
[5:37:31] MikeyMike26: No
[5:37:31] ramski_maru: That's what's called a cop
[5:37:32] asakka: no
[5:37:32] sterowentUS: bounty hunters should try to acquire information illegally
[5:37:33] De_vidas: black market one maybe
[5:37:37] mlangcs: no

[5:37:38] ilgindrajith: maybe
[5:37:38] ZedsFiction: not a plate reader, but maybe look it up through MDW?
[5:37:39] adch03: No
[5:37:39] OctoNox: no
[5:37:39] Amatthew123: If you have an MDW then it would make sense you can also run plates
[5:37:40] mlangcs: your not a cop m8
[5:37:42] Unitedterror: not actively with govt but they would be able to work with people to figure that out easily @Kyle , in practicality bounty hunters have their own plate reading systems im sure
[5:37:43] Icalldibs: theyd call the PD @Kyle
[5:37:44] swaghetti77: Nah
[5:37:44] mr_deepsense_: That's just too easy
[5:37:44] connerc88: No
[5:37:44] Anterra: nope
[5:37:45] Rem753: @Spikee439 they would need to get a percentage of the value of the asset, but it should go to the state
[5:37:45] KingTheTurtle: At what point are they just cops
[5:37:46] DirtyDanFromDiscord: ALPRs probably not, a way to run plates maybe
[5:37:46] Natrix91: @Kyle dont u americans have bound's mens or what its called?
[5:37:46] Nitrogen_triiodide: nah they're private citizens, that's a government database thing they don't have access to
[5:37:47] MikeyMike26: Bounty Hunters are not law enforcement or government employees
[5:37:48] Roobeman: Just starting to sound like a cop without the cop whitelist
[5:37:48] esrou: An illegal one would be cool
[5:37:51] dave_j86: not legally
[5:37:51] Anterra: absolutely not kyle
[5:37:53] one_two_x_you730: Most bounty hunters are ex cops or have people in law enforcement/dmv
[5:37:53] itbjake11: a plate reader yes but you gotta find out the plate from pd first
[5:37:53] TheMCA_Police: black market yes NODDERS
[5:37:54] ramski_maru: That's what cops do not bounty hunters
[5:37:56] rojeezee: maybe with a friend on the inside
[5:37:57] ShrimpCommander: @Tooots if mike had the money but spat in gov's face is one thing, being indigent is another.
[5:38:02] Natrix91: just base it of them
[5:38:05] Hotot1: Not reader but call cousin in Texas where they don't have as strict laws
[5:38:05] swaghetti77: Need to get a PD buddy for that
[5:38:10] IrrationallyUbiquitous: Bounty hunter dispatch
[5:38:11] jnpigeon: if they knew someone at dispatch they could
[5:38:11] skoadx: don't make it too easy for the BH
[5:38:12] ONEsikJohnson: licence plates are public record, anyone can get that info
[5:38:12] ExsoNova: Bank usage pings maybe? @Kyle
[5:38:13] sterowentUS: illegal equipment would be pretty cool, or working with a dirty cop or dispatch
[5:38:15] TheMCA_Police: black market with low accuracy NODDERS
[5:38:16] Rem753: @Kyle can you search by plate on MDW?
[5:38:16] early_retirement: part of the fun is the schemes to get them tho
[5:38:17] Spikee439: a cop radio that you could steal as a bounty hunter?
[5:38:20] woofen: @themca_police @the_devilyouknow applebeTIPSY applebeHeyU
[5:38:22] one_two_x_you730: The meta MDW show if they are online and have outstanding fines is all you need
[5:38:25] speedracer38: @kyle 100%, repo companies have cars with plate readers on them
[5:38:26] Rigben: I think anyone can go to a Motor Vehicles and get a plate looked up
[5:38:28] dmbck: They can and do, it is called the LexusNexus database...
[5:38:33] xtheoneandmany: maybe see ATM pings of those who owe

[5:38:35] The_Devilyouknow: @woofen applebeShlorp WAVE kyleisHug
[5:38:36] Spikee439: fake lights in your car?
[5:38:38] 1njectionz: you’re a bounty hunter you should at least get a cool helmet
[5:38:41] ineedtopooprightnow: how about you can only type in the plate in the bounty Hunter  car.
[5:38:42] Spikee439: No
[5:38:43] CMF_LOONEYTOON: yes
[5:38:45] Miditron6000: Bounty hunters should get radios and a channel
[5:38:50] Hotot1: Foia registration for a person?
[5:38:54] itbjake11: just have an inside man at pd
[5:38:58] Seetherrr: Maybe a way to search plates using Ruby so Bounty Hunters have to kind of ride the grey market if they want to do that and make deals with crims to acquire ruby
[5:39:03] De_vidas: sirents on
[5:39:04] ExsoNova: PEPW
[5:39:05] MarginalMartyr: Give people with outstanding fines a parole officer or something to check in with, otherwise they get dinged.
[5:39:05] itbjake11: and have them give you a ic job that gives you a plate reader
[5:39:08] sandshader: A 10 min delay ping system on the location of the target  you can select 3 targets per day.
[5:39:10] JoannaLeFae: That guy has overdue fines
[5:39:13] one_two_x_you730: Burton becomes your inside guy

[5:39:30] ZedsFiction: who's he with :o
[5:39:32] CMF_LOONEYTOON: a bounty hunter should be able to tell cops Hey This GUy is Wanted Is over here 100%
[5:39:51] CMF_LOONEYTOON: So Yes
[5:40:00] Axiom462: was that normal voice?
[5:40:23] JoannaLeFae: Lack of
[5:40:30] huge_a_hole: yes
[5:40:31] Tooots: Both, kinda
[5:40:32] CMF_LOONEYTOON: a  little bit of both
[5:40:33] itbjake11: lack of
[5:40:35] one_two_x_you730: I think that judge was SOP locked
[5:40:46] Seetherrr: @one_two_x_you730 same
[5:40:47] ExsoNova: YEP
[5:40:48] bruhkewl: or the precedent that has been set thus far
[5:40:50] huge_a_hole: find out in RP
[5:40:59] CMF_LOONEYTOON: Needs a little bit of Clarification
[5:41:00] Jack_treehorn: Lack of caselaw.
[5:41:01] Erigzback: Yeah I don't get that judge ruling on self defense
[5:41:03] MoldyBaby: as long as you fear for your life
[5:41:05] ItsMeMattK: there arent civ SOPs on force matrix shit
[5:41:07] OctoNox: self defense just requires matching threat level so if the threat is your life you can defend in that matter
[5:41:07] AerialAce94: Jordan shot two people who threatened him with a golf club and got away with it
[5:41:08] Tooots: People get confused by cop force matrix and self defence
[5:41:09] sterowentUS: well, cops want to keep the peace in RP, so they have bias towards docile parties
[5:41:10] Seetherrr: Fists can be 100% deadly, they say it isnt on this server but IRL, espeically for an old man, its deadly af
[5:41:10] Hotot1: State laws are very different
[5:41:11] mr_deepsense_: Use batons
[5:41:14] one_two_x_you730: It is literally NVL if you match force
[5:41:17] DominickPerrero: kyleisGun kyleisGun kyleisGun kyleisGun
[5:41:18] rykoxd93: are there stand your ground laws on the server?
[5:41:23] JoannaLeFae: Which isn't how that should work.
[5:41:27] itbjake11: if someone beats me irl im pulling out my 9mm js
[5:41:34] OctoNox: matching threat level not matching means
[5:41:36] itbjake11: no fucking lethal force shit
[5:41:37] DominickPerrero: That's be
[5:41:39] woofen: the judge also said other judges would see it differently
[5:41:39] Spikee439: that is so dumb
[5:41:40] Amatthew123: nah if they are a threat to your life, you should be able to shoot them
[5:41:40] itbjake11: its self defense
[5:41:41] Seetherrr: @itbjake11 exactly, the great equalizer
[5:41:42] Kyuleze: if an old man gets punched I hope he blasts them
[5:41:43] ShrimpCommander: today was first day i've seen onx doj mention equal force. Cops been had a +1 force over crim sop forever. Equal force match is dumb AF
[5:41:43] Aug412: Is it possible for people who have fines past due can have their phone pinged every so often for a general location
[5:41:44] ItsMeMattK: the juge was DEAD WRONG
[5:41:45] Tooots: YEP
[5:41:45] yoyomancoolman: talk about it more with the Judge? Shrug
[5:41:46] AerialAce94: you can't be the aggressor in self defense by defention
[5:41:47] JoannaLeFae: That is what he was saying, yes.
[5:41:48] mikejonesrp: just start punching mofos and make them pay fines
[5:41:49] FuriousBlizzard: YEP
[5:41:51] narvahhh: You can 100% die from getting punched so you should be allowed to use a gun to defend yourself
[5:41:53] ectobeast1: That's called the UK law lol
[5:41:55] Hotot1: California it makes sense
[5:41:55] AaronOnAir: wait what?! Why can you not use deadly force on someone beating you?
[5:42:02] dave_j86: shoot them KKona
[5:42:03] one_two_x_you730: One punch can kill you
[5:42:07] itbjake11: @Seetherrr literally the great equalizer
[5:42:07] early_retirement: I think being outnumbered would factor in
[5:42:10] Spikee439: nothing
[5:42:10] DirtyDanFromDiscord: did Hat get charged with a felony?
[5:42:11] Jack_Avenger: KKona Stand your ground
[5:42:12] CMF_LOONEYTOON: Stand Your Ground Law it is Los Santos
[5:42:21] itbjake11: me defending myself with a gun is valuing my life irl lol
[5:42:22] early_retirement: thats what I mean
[5:42:25] Rigben: fists can be lethal to though
[5:42:26] Smacky20: knuckle dusters meta NODDERS
[5:42:28] Nitrogen_triiodide: jordan pulled a gun and shot two people who had golf clubs the other day, he didn't even go to trial the cops let him walk LuL
[5:42:30] Rem753: just one bench ruling, doesn't set a precedence
[5:42:34] Tooots: In US is the self defence laws different by state?
[5:42:36] Spikee439: that is how it should be
[5:42:38] OctoNox: yeah
[5:42:40] manzri: equal force should only be applied to cops but even then
[5:42:40] kojialfa: The city is turning into Sweden LUL LUL, get robbed and do nothing
[5:42:41] AaronOnAir: GOOD THING WE LIVE IN TEXAS BRUTHER WE CAN SHOOT YEEHAW
[5:42:42] one_two_x_you730: In real life if someone hits you once you can literally die
[5:42:43] itbjake11: only thing you cant do is shoot someone in the back. which means they started to walk away
[5:42:43] Seetherrr: @DirtyDanFromDiscord no but a judge said his "defense" which was an escalation should have potentially resulted in charges
[5:42:44] ItsMeMattK: even 1 on 1 a fist can be deadly force
[5:42:45] ShrimpCommander: that judge must have been using a little too much personal bias PEPW
[5:42:48] BazzWilder: In Texas and Florida
[5:42:48] CMF_LOONEYTOON: It is the US TBH
[5:42:51] Deetea86: KKona
[5:42:52] sterowentUS: the issue is, loud = all sorts of things to cops. if you seem like a nuisance the cops will take the other party's side naturally
[5:42:53] Crosis86: feel like it depends on the judge
[5:42:54] DeliriousBeast: @tooots most things are different by state in the us
[5:42:55] AaronOnAir: Mornin lol
[5:42:57] bruhkewl: @Tooots they do vary
[5:42:59] dirtycadaver: I could see having a gun out as threat of lethal force
[5:42:59] Erigzback: What does the legislation say on self defense in onx?
[5:43:07] FuriousBlizzard: if it's not practical to retreat, yeah
[5:43:08] Miditron6000: @aarononair  KKona Clap
[5:43:17] woofen: BoVice comes at you 1 punch, you can’t shoot?
[5:43:23] ShrimpCommander: LUL in order to cover equal force self defense you need an arsenal of weapons in your pockets and the right one on your belt ready
[5:43:32] Amatthew123: Stand your ground is like nuclear deterrent, if you remove the lethal force it doesn't work
[5:43:42] itbjake11: especially in gta once someone throws hands then fuck it. use whatever
[5:43:42] Seetherrr: @sterowentUS more witnesses on your side = massive favor in court/police view from what ive seen, everytime a person is out numbered they pretty much always lose in court even if they were in the right
[5:43:43] sterowentUS: @woofen in court you can argue deadly force is their hands, yeah
[5:43:43] Natrix91: Run awey :P
[5:43:46] huge_a_hole: is there a force matrix law ????
[5:43:48] esrou: Bats are not as weildy as a gun
[5:43:52] mr_deepsense_: Run away
[5:43:57] OctoNox: i think there was a misunderstanding there
[5:44:02] molluskaraptor: your a civ there's no force matrix .
[5:44:06] Rem753: @Kyle you should be able to read it in documents on MDW
[5:44:07] Miditron6000: Force matrix.doesnt apply to bounty hunters
[5:44:16] ShrimpCommander: cop force matric isn't equal either, it's +1 to the threat LUL
[5:44:17] itbjake11: civs dont have lethal force laws
[5:44:24] ItsMeMattK: Jordan has shot plenty of unarmed people, just get a drop knife
[5:44:29] CMF_LOONEYTOON: Is Stand Your Ground a LAW  In Los Santos Though ?  Court House Question 100%
[5:44:32] sterowentUS: the force matrix for civilians is, can we assume you didn't have a reason to outright kill a guy while defending yourself
[5:44:32] yoyomancoolman: just read whats in the MDW and talk with the judge when he is around Shrug
[5:44:45] MisterTohru: you either have a reasonable fear for your life or you don’t as a civ
[5:44:46] huge_a_hole: just plant a gun on them
[5:44:46] itbjake11: court might say why did you use and rpg against fists but still defend yourself lmao
[5:44:52] Aug412: Is it possible for bounty hunters to get a ping Everytime a target uses an electronic purchase
[5:44:55] OctoNox: it's about equal threat level not equal means

[5:45:36] jensen808: depends, you can't claim self defense if you present an imminent threat. which can be argued you did since you were making verbal threats and pulled your baton first. but in a vaccuum you can shoot people beating you
