[6:42:20] bub3110: it’s funny that gloryon’s car has been to the race but not gloryon himself
[6:42:22] Deftscythe: do the fivem cars perform at all similar to the vanilla GTA V cars? If so I'm not shocked about the sultan since in the base game it's like the starter racing car

[6:43:01] kyulen742: holy shit we almost caught up with the 2nd to last driver
[6:43:03] Yuusles: think the manuals are better, the hill gradients allow you to pick the gears quicker than if you were to have an auto, bit of delay
