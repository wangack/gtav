[1:57:25] EriginalE: which is a question
[1:57:26] b2a80: Cant they give you a lawful order to leave an active scene.  Not detained during that.
[1:57:29] chokebot17: You can definitely give people a lawful order even if they aren't detained. Like telling people to leave the area of an active scene
[1:58:05] chokebot17: I'm not suggesting what THEY did was a lawful order. Just saying there are circumstances when they can give orders without detaining
[1:58:23] OverGiant: no reason given, just right to "I am giving you a lawful order to leave"
[1:58:31] b2a80: was just a scenario where someone is not detained and given a lawful order

[1:59:13] ThicccBrickBoi: Guard THIS
[1:59:14] chokebot17: I go to places frequently that have PD stationed, doesn't mean they can just tell people to leave. See every football stadium in the US
[1:59:25] EnigmaQuip: I could see the rebuttal to you being a contractor is you aren't on duty with them right now, so you aren't working for them

[2:01:22] ThicccBrickBoi: You were vault adjacent.not inside
[2:01:30] MarKingYo: if its "restricted" the owner needs to have signs posted, and make an effort to have  it locked. if you walk into a public building and doors aren't locked you can freely walk in.
[2:02:17] EnigmaQuip: you are a customer of the bank with a safe deposit box, we're just trying to access it

[5:07:49] DezalbM: it was rp heated
[5:08:00] SpookyCarnage: PD got cornrolled fr
[5:08:01] MadChemistTHC: which was dumb for corndog because slacks was the only one defending him
[5:08:18] ThicccBrickBoi: Oh ya. They kinda wanna push 2nd degree murder on him
[5:08:34] DezalbM: for killing a one lifer
[5:08:40] MadChemistTHC: nah he actually says slacks was standing for him, it was a crazy scene
[5:08:43] SpookyCarnage: Slacks is taking the fall for the other captains, he wont say he objected to the murder charge
[5:08:56] ThicccBrickBoi: For Dean's one life character
[5:09:00] MadChemistTHC: good point
[5:09:28] MadChemistTHC: it was the doulbe mag dump i guess
[5:09:29] Suvaacc: yeah there were like 7 of them shooting i think
[5:09:35] ThicccBrickBoi: That was part of cornwoods argumt
[5:09:39] ThicccBrickBoi: Argument
[5:09:42] Celascion: i thought the bullets can be traced back to their guns?
[5:09:55] MarKingYo: a little after the shooting cornwood shot the guy in the chest and said thats for brian knight. and thats why the want to charge em
[5:10:11] ThicccBrickBoi: @markingyo for Sam baas not knight
[5:10:12] MadChemistTHC: watching all that from Mehdi's pov is so good
[5:10:20] MarKingYo: :( i was close
[5:10:23] Suvaacc: @Celascion thats not the argument, the argument is which gun bullet caused perma, if there are bullets from 7 guns how do you choose
[5:10:59] SpookyCarnage: I dont think he died until he got to hospital anyways
[5:11:26] ThicccBrickBoi: Cornwood was getting a little OOC upset that he now has to put all this on slacks. It's a read the room situation IMO. He agrees he should have got punished but not 5 daps for 1 bullet
[5:11:26] Celascion: Honestly, they should have pushed for desecration of corpse. That's a lot easier to prove given his mag dump
[5:11:28] MadChemistTHC: I'd say so even if it is corndog just imo
[5:11:56] Suvaacc: cornwood used excessive force tho, he used like 2 mags to shoot him and after he was already down also
[5:11:58] DezalbM: well he's finally ingame so ask him if you see him
[5:12:07] scha_de: DAP THIS
[5:12:08] SpookyCarnage: He got 2 or 3 for calling himself sherrif
[5:12:12] Ziimms: I'm suprised he even got a review after the things he did lmao
[5:12:17] DezalbM: lol he never checks texts
[5:13:27] MadChemistTHC: Corndog needs a mentor, he always had FiveO in 3.0
[5:13:45] DezalbM: the biggest problem is they punish them and never correct them
[5:13:57] SpookyCarnage: The mayor and some cops he interviewed brought that up, cops get dapped but never told what to do instead

[5:16:14] SpookyCarnage: getting 10 daps means you get put up for review, but its reviewed by the people who issue daps, so the problem there is they wont admit they're wrong
[5:16:50] ThicccBrickBoi: It has lead to good rp but I preferred how they started the pd in 3.0. had a solid base of good cops and people were actually scared of the cops. I remember everyone was terrified of koils cop the first bit
