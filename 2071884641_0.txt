[5:32:13] Meatyfrog: There had to be money for ELI to be involved with Prodigy yeah?
[5:32:16] blackinvador: @toratora_TT You vegans always want everything organic peepoChrist
[5:32:23] Cinalipples: You open the Calendar yet?

[5:32:52] crabhowse: PotFriend
[5:32:52] Thundershot: man I didn't even know Eli came back
[5:32:54] Meatyfrog: I heard it was Prodigy and noped out
[5:33:03] Thundershot: that dude got me into watching in the first place
[5:33:05] Meatyfrog: I was so excited to see it, but then said nah when it was Prodigy
[5:33:05] toratora_TT: sheriff
[5:33:09] c3ru: he get paid to?
[5:33:17] Leviathan_Rage89: differn't things i understand

[5:33:21] dreamsofbunnies: Sherriff eli he was old role player back in the day
[5:33:23] Soraffe: oh SheriffEli? I love him
[5:33:24] b_dummy_: do you forsee a Ziggy Wingsong reunion in the future?
[5:33:25] Daak_Cloud: yes I was lucky to see him one day there sheriffDJ
[5:33:40] Agarthan: he would actually be perfect to help whip the PD into shape here
[5:33:40] crabhowse: moonSSS ellethwenSip
[5:33:46] gvwolf: @Soraffe he was big on familyRP for playing a no nonsense cop until he was "forced" to move on allegedly
[5:33:49] RAWSTYLE: sheriff Eli 🤩
[5:33:51] favrashi: in the calander?
[5:33:52] Cinalipples: Calendar
[5:33:53] Wabaki817: calendar

[5:34:00] Liquid_In_Silico: When Charlie played Sheila on Onx it was hilarious and people talked about her for weeks I swear LUL
[5:34:03] Meatyfrog: Directory is the Yellow Pages
[5:34:04] blackinvador: yellowpages is directory
[5:34:08] dreamsofbunnies: He called me out on stream once and I almost pooped myself panicking LUL
[5:34:14] Soraffe: @gvwolf basically he didn't fit the childish narrative that is now "RP"
[5:34:18] chizilla_tv: calendar
[5:34:25] EchosAxe: @Liquid_In_Silico yeah i noticed that too
[5:34:27] Meatyfrog: I thought Eli/Penta were chill?
[5:34:32] Agarthan: what penta drama
[5:34:35] dreamsofbunnies: They were
[5:34:39] ZoneyZoned: was there penta drama? I know about the leanbois drama
[5:34:54] Soraffe: People having problems in RP and Penta seem to go hand and hand.
[5:35:00] crabhowse: sentryHB sentryHB sentryHB sentryHB sentryHB sentryHB sentryHB sentryHB
[5:35:01] gvwolf: @Soraffe I quite liked him but yeah pretty much and exactly what Sentry just mentioned
[5:35:02] Leviathan_Rage89: just glad you are having fun my man
[5:35:07] Liquid_In_Silico: That was Yonkers ago really
[5:35:08] War_Penguin: tfrp was a drama factory
[5:35:18] toratora_TT: drama is inevitable,goes with the territory
[5:35:19] Meatyfrog: TFRP was a drama factory
[5:35:21] Meatyfrog: lel
[5:35:25] Daak_Cloud: right after the twitch con exbcQw
[5:35:26] crabhowse: 💯🙌🦷
[5:35:27] KontrolStyle: YEP
[5:35:34] dreamsofbunnies: That was forever ago. I found you because of Eli
[5:35:35] Agarthan: i mean i could be wrong here but afaik bob and eli never have had any drama i've never once heard him speak poorly of him
[5:35:42] Agarthan: his aussie is named Eli
[5:35:47] Liquid_In_Silico: I'm very surprised no one has made a documentary about RP dra and it's history. It is RICH in drama
[5:35:48] c3ru: tbh i thought eli just kinda ditched "online world" entirely
[5:35:50] ObscureMyth: both strong personalities
[5:35:52] Liquid_In_Silico: And content
[5:35:53] b_dummy_: the penta arch with the turtle was some of the best rp ive ever seen. You blowing up the courts and getting away will go down in history
[5:35:58] justice5150: Drama aside, I miss those days
[5:35:59] OnlineDatabase: The RP on family was so good though.
[5:36:09] Meatyfrog: @Liquid_In_Silico there's like 4 hour expose's about the downfall of Family Rp
[5:36:22] azmer1987: @liquid_in_silico twitch deleted so much 2.0 if I knew back then what I know now...
[5:36:30] Meatyfrog: @SilentSentry it's the directory
[5:36:34] blackinvador: I think directory is the closest thing
[5:36:38] BoozeMarlin: is there not an event calendar?
[5:36:42] scuffedhipz: shadowbanned by elon PepeLaugh
[5:36:44] Sgt_BeeFart: catJAM GuitarTime
[5:36:52] blackinvador: you're looking at it
[5:36:53] Liquid_In_Silico: I thought there was a calendar
[5:36:54] xxjustmarkxx: In the directory you type events
[5:36:54] Meatyfrog: The directory is "the yellow pages"
[5:37:23] greeedly: What ever happened to pmsproxy? drama?>
[5:37:27] xxjustmarkxx: Yeah and if you type events you can see everything going on
[5:37:53] gvwolf: 100% Sentry
[5:37:59] poppa_willy: 100%
[5:38:00] Liquid_In_Silico: @meatyfrog I did not know wow
[5:38:00] Meatyfrog: yeah the GTARP Online RP where people are props for THEIR story is wild
[5:38:05] blackinvador: yeah for the longest time there was nowhere else to go
[5:38:06] Agarthan: when they sacked penta on the family admin team that was after eli left im pretty sure so idk how that would have impacted their relationship
[5:38:06] xxpops: agree
[5:38:10] c3ru: and some people are looking for a get rich quick scheme
[5:38:19] Liquid_In_Silico: @meatyfrog know the name of the video?
[5:38:25] azmer1987: Your snake rp breakout with bovice was my favorite memory in rp of all time. Thank you, you are the man
[5:38:28] gvwolf: yeah if something is missing on one server then jump to another ...you have the best of both worlds
[5:38:29] BoozeMarlin: def has happened
[5:38:43] Soraffe: *cough* NoPixel *cough*
[5:39:04] Meatyfrog: @Liquid_In_Silico just youtube "downfall of family rp"
[5:39:04] roadkills0s: it sucks that some people are split up across servers but it better for the overall communities health
[5:39:08] c3ru: i'm not as into RP anymore but i do love there being different chutes for styles, pretty obviously healthier
[5:39:12] Soraffe: people default to those apartments LUL
[5:39:13] blackinvador: I just wonder how the crim side will evolve on this server because they have mechanics created already they just don't think people are ready for it so they're holding on to it
[5:39:13] crabhowse: Find the others moonDOTDOTDOT
[5:39:15] toratora_TT: a rolling stone gathers no moss
[5:39:20] Liquid_In_Silico: @meatyfrog thanks
[5:39:22] gvwolf: sentryH nofCozy
[5:39:37] Soraffe: competition
[5:39:43] Cpt_Coaster: wish the breaking into the police station thing worked out. that was unreal RP @silentsentry
[5:40:05] crabhowse: Collaboration is awesome as well. Early is internet forums when nothing was monetized just pure rep
[5:40:08] Soraffe: Competition is a good thing
[5:40:34] gvwolf: gvwolf is gifting 5 Tier 1 Subs to SilentSentry's community! They've gifted a total of 59 in the channel! 
[5:40:34] Moobot: PogChamp @gvwolf gives 5 subscriptions to the channel! PogChamp
[5:40:34] gvwolf: gvwolf gifted a Tier 1 sub to CarloGamingSim229!

[5:40:39] KontrolStyle: Pog
[5:40:39] xxpops: onx has a great doj, lot's of judges

[5:41:43] crabhowse: It's the human condition
[5:41:46] toratora_TT: @c3ru check out a film called 'share'
[5:41:55] BoozeMarlin: cliques seem to be a common issue on rp servers
[5:41:57] Soraffe: It's 100% reason why I won't watch NoPixel, certain streamers especially ones we've already mentioned are discipline immune
[5:42:05] chaosandlead: its funny only certain peopl get banned for stealing pd guns but some people steal 10 with no rp reason and are fine
[5:42:25] Moobot: Welcome chilllinnn! bleedPurple
[5:42:28] c3ru: @toratora_TT yeah don't think i saw that one, i'm well versed in the privacy subject tho
[5:42:30] Liquid_In_Silico: We reached the drive around and talk part  PrideRise
[5:42:30] Agarthan: np will inevitably devolve they never fixed the culture issues that created the climate they just have a fresh coat of paint and some new appliances
[5:42:31] KontrolStyle: NODDERS
[5:42:44] poppa_willy: NODDERS

[5:43:15] Liquid_In_Silico: "I'm just here for a drink"
[5:43:16] crabhowse: sentryRNG
[5:43:27] Meatyfrog: The thing that's wild is that ELI is still remembered as a "power abuser" but in 3.0 Koil did so much worse, it's wild.
[5:43:46] flogbishop: it cant since one of them is an owner
[5:43:57] crabhowse: I'm just here for chaos and fun
[5:44:01] KontrolStyle: hell yeah
[5:44:10] toratora_TT: forget all that shit
[5:44:11] gvwolf: exactly I lov the RP you provide Sentry sentryH sentryGV
[5:44:12] Soraffe: Koil is so much worse, he 100% has his buddies on NoPixel and they don't get in trouble but if you're an average RPer and you do it, RIP you.
[5:44:13] Agarthan: it's been largely drama free over here from what i've seen
[5:44:28] EchosAxe: 8am est i think
[5:44:35] Meatyfrog: @SilentSentry I thought it was 12 in the afternoon, but it's appparently 8am now
[5:44:40] Soraffe: ONX has little to no drama is so nice to see.
[5:44:52] diesel_702: you should check out MnM Zb’s server some time. Good mix of rp and drama free. 150 pop with 40+ q.
[5:44:58] crabhowse: 💯 real AF over here we keep it honest
[5:45:02] Cinalipples: VU open?
[5:45:24] KosumoNZ: After 6 hours, @SilentSentry discovers he has been playing GTA V single play the whole time!
[5:45:29] Agarthan: and you wont with an admin team with people like aleks and mantis
[5:45:32] azmer1987: I think he is basically retired now. So he's just chillin soraffe
[5:45:35] c3ru: i'm just hoping ONX addresses drama just as appropriately if & when it starts growing
[5:45:36] NobodyFromOhio: Omg Sentry on GTA RP makes me so happy
[5:45:49] AndyAndyXD: the mid-night reset info was false, Someone mentioned in chat it's 8am or 8pm not sure
[5:45:57] BoozeMarlin: anything on twister or whatever they call their twitter app?
[5:46:02] Soraffe: @azmer1987 Doesn't matter, he tainted NoPixel so it's cringe as fuck for me, to watch any streamer who does NoPixel.
[5:46:15] Reptar1025: onx? hell yeah
[5:46:16] ZoneyZoned: 8 am est I believe @andyandyxd
[5:46:23] azmer1987: @soraffe understandable 100
[5:46:25] AndyAndyXD: ^
[5:46:28] Liquid_In_Silico: Signing in on Taxi or Tow means you can do exactly what you're doing now but get paid lol
[5:46:30] c3ru: big streamers who chase meta were obviously gonna go to NP
[5:46:42] c3ru: for the new release and nothing more
[5:46:54] gvwolf: thats pretty cool events in the calendar SeemsGood
[5:47:17] crabhowse: @c3ru  that's the way it needs to be
[5:47:20] toratora_TT: from what i've seen of onyx it seems pretty healthy in it's infancy
[5:47:31] Soraffe: is that set for your time @SilentSentry or server time?
[5:47:32] c3ru: oh yeah i know
[5:47:43] BoozeMarlin: life drawing sounded interesting imo
[5:48:15] Banaynay_: its a fight
[5:48:27] c3ru: i don't envy trying to work around DMCA

[5:49:50] c3ru: idk man that sounds in a way really healthy to me
[5:50:02] gvwolf: LUL like a stag party or something
[5:50:13] NobodyFromOhio: What is our character?

[7:08:50] AndyAndyXD: Maybe I'll reach out!! Dane Cook https://clips.twitch.tv/AdventurousSingleLouseDBstyle-hldDvKnYSKCI4oCD
[7:08:54] zauhn92: yeah everyone treated him like jay too  not the character he was trying to do
[7:08:56] Robkeebler: i like how you compared him to nickleback
[7:09:03] PhayroArcus: i watch him play call of duty sometimes
[7:09:07] BlunderedHope: he got pauly shore syndromed pretty hard
[7:09:11] crabhowse: Humor is humor though honestly I appreciate all of it
[7:09:52] AndyAndyXD: Oh no
[7:09:58] bladedge28: there gas cans?
[7:10:03] AntleredCormorant: nickelback sold a fuckton of records to somebody
[7:10:04] klaatuNaatu: Well, they ain't getting that rental back
[7:10:26] 0ctember: I don't know about the Dane Cook stuff, but there are some comedians who I can't deal with anymore because the shit they did was actually wildly bad
[7:10:33] crabhowse: Shore and cook and Botox getting older and shit I don't know man
[7:11:11] 0ctember: he was huge for a while
[7:11:41] crabhowse: He's been off the radar for a while like he can live or whatever it's a rough world for comedy
[7:11:51] itsdonbran: he used Napster to skyrocket his success
[7:11:54] JPRoads: I bet part of it is Dane Cook hit like right along with the internet.
[7:11:57] klaatuNaatu: LUL
[7:12:01] zauhn92: the  weasel character  was a stand up act paully developed he used to do that bit  in mid late 80's
[7:12:25] itsdonbran: nah I think he made like huge million dollar deals with napster
[7:12:30] crabhowse: He's not Metallica yes haha
[7:12:31] zauhn92: yeah that one bit
[7:12:36] BlunderedHope: I agree with you. I'm not a huge fan of his stuff, but it was wild how opinion of him just turned on a dime
[7:12:36] KontrolStyle: hahah classic
[7:12:46] klaatuNaatu: LUL 󠀀
[7:12:48] Sgt_BeeFart: SeemsGood
[7:12:51] Robkeebler: pauly did make it in a disney movie - the goofy movie
[7:12:52] AndyAndyXD: Someone fucked up LUL
[7:12:52] JPRoads: Good thing you didn't get gas.
[7:13:00] bladedge28: in the army now

[7:13:24] Robkeebler: chillin with the weeeezal
[7:13:28] zauhn92: yep
[7:13:29] bladedge28: jury duty
[7:13:38] DestroyerDarkmass: Paulie and Dane were together in Workaholics episode
[7:13:52] 0ctember: in the 80s and 90s there were a lot of comedians who built a career out of creating "character / persona" -- pauly shore, gilbert godfried, bobcat goldthwait
[7:13:58] JPRoads: I bet he could do one of those One Man Shows telling stories.
[7:13:59] Gr1mm4ss: In the Army Now was great
[7:14:03] thekegshow: pauly has that short richard simmons movie
[7:14:20] crabhowse: That would be an opportunity
[7:14:24] bladedge28: he probably did but it is probably not well known
[7:14:28] BlunderedHope: oh I would love to see him give that a shot
[7:14:37] EchosAxe: i watched that Pinocchio movie he voiced acted for a couple years back, that was brutal
[7:14:37] BlunderedHope: Tarantino could get something out of him
[7:14:37] zauhn92: he is good  i think
[7:15:06] crabhowse: Tom Green stood the test of time at least and he did some weird comedy haha
[7:15:10] JPRoads: I think he's had a bit of a resurgence with comedian podcasts.
[7:15:27] zauhn92: i don't know how bad he got with drugs  i never have heard that story
[7:15:33] horridhuman: Pauly was on Kill Tony a couple weeks ago
[7:15:41] kalphite: I think she's scared of Christians. Understandable.
[7:15:48] thekegshow: the simmons movie is premiering at sundance film festival, he'll get a lot of exposure
[7:15:56] piizzastarfish: He was on Kill Tony not long ago he for sure still gets fucked up LUL
[7:16:03] 0ctember: @crabhowse did he stand the test of time? I feel like I haven't heard about Tom Green in at least a decade
[7:16:07] bladedge28: 2022 and 2023 he did 2 movies where he was the voice of a character
[7:16:09] EvilGUMMYB34R: Pauly was in a short film The Court Jester as Richard Simmons
[7:16:10] JPRoads: A lot of podcasts exist solely for ad reads right now. lol
[7:16:13] affinityfriendlyartifacts: i cant wait till you meet my char on ONX you'll either be like WTF  or be rolling laughing
[7:16:13] crabhowse: Podcasts are the dumpster fire of the Internet
[7:16:21] MavericksPaint: every turd on tiktok has a podcast now
[7:17:07] KontrolStyle: yeah tt is full of podcasts
[7:17:17] Syrinx69_: Vodcast
[7:17:27] EchosAxe: i listen to couple but yeah i dont browse them
[7:17:33] Gr1mm4ss: i remember Marc Maron used to make fun of people who used the internet, then he became Mr Podcast
[7:17:36] BlunderedHope: @Syrinx69_ oh that's pretty good
[7:17:48] KontrolStyle: haha
[7:17:48] klaatuNaatu: LUL
[7:17:49] crabhowse: Podcasts are like mlm life coaches. And Live streams or twitch are still mostly authentic
[7:17:55] Dizy: OMEGALUL
[7:17:56] zauhn92: i thought he was wanting to do a movie about Richard Simmons but Richard was not having it
[7:18:02] 0ctember: why was my mom in that truck?
[7:18:08] HyphyStryke: HUHH
[7:18:13] BlunderedHope: that was the final straw in that marriage
[7:18:21] HyphyStryke: YOURE BACK 😘
[7:18:29] DarnComputer: Binoculous
[7:19:07] JPRoads: My favorite era of podcasting is when they got popular enough to get like B-list celebrities who were very interesting and candid.
[7:19:08] crabhowse: It's all monetized and tracked and broken down into bullshit. I miss when you just cashed the check and didn't need to be obsessive with engagement
[7:19:13] Gr1mm4ss: the first season of Norm Macdonalds podcast was the funniest thing on the internet
[7:19:18] MavericksPaint: podcasts rely so heavily on sense of humor. Theres loads of podcasts where people just ramble and lecture and it goes no where
[7:19:40] JPRoads: Yes. lol
[7:19:43] KontrolStyle: hahaha
[7:19:49] m_Gordon: I remember that lol
[7:19:50] BlunderedHope: KEKW that was so painful
[7:20:06] BlunderedHope: he wanted to do a talk show interview on reddit
[7:20:40] piizzastarfish: Adam Driver went on Bill Burrs pod i thought it was a decent convo
[7:21:02] crabhowse: CEO of Reddit got 193 million dollars bye planet earth lmao
[7:21:06] 0ctember: there are good podcasts specific to esoteric interests. Like, if you like horror short stories, you can find great podcasts that have horror short stories. But general podcasts where the draw is the personality of the hosts and celebrity guests. That's so generic now
[7:21:09] MavericksPaint: yuuuuuuuuup
[7:21:35] Gr1mm4ss: i only watch badfriends podcast
[7:21:46] MavericksPaint: ricky gervais could do a podcast
[7:21:57] Hurdur_DaddyTag: shotzAyy shotzAyy shotzAyy
[7:22:20] EchosAxe: that was me too
[7:22:28] crabhowse: Yup
[7:22:37] Syrinx69_: My fav podcasts are the ones that talk about science, space, UFOs aliens, Ai, the future etc.
[7:22:40] forrock: Working in a factory has made me buy an unholy amount of audio books.
[7:22:51] 0ctember: well it's like watching twitch streams. the phenomenon of ephemeral media
[7:23:24] NightHawk91: Last Podcast on the Left is great very funny
[7:23:35] crabhowse: I still love paper and books and libraries
[7:23:43] Undepth: I'm a vod weirdo :(
[7:23:57] JPRoads: It's also fun getting in on the ground floor of something.
