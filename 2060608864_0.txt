[2:47:06] TheHairyCheeto: My favorite reality TV show is watching any form of government on live stream
[2:47:08] StephyFace: It's congress it's not suppose to be exciting, it's suppose to be professional LUL

[2:51:16] ancientpeas: It is like they learned about irony from Alannis.
[2:51:25] VolenoVehro: People just love to ignore what they hate in other people if it's "their guy". People made Trump "their guy" and won't let go.

[2:53:43] The_Irish_Ace: Lies like it's her Job KEKW
[2:53:44] SQUIDWARD360: I'm not voting until The Rock runs
[2:53:45] L0va: she'd be better than trump tbh
[2:53:45] TheHairyCheeto: twitch chat political talk is more civil than irl "legislators" lol
[2:53:46] DanLGG: these are the only options we have. Jesus Christ can you imagine having to pick between Biden or Trump. I pick or. just leave the pres seat empty
[2:53:46] trippinleftyHD: shes younger...
[2:53:46] Scriix: She's awful too
[2:53:50] Senna_Minxy: She is a bit out there, who doesn't know her history too well
[2:53:55] kaeleirra: America needs a woman president
[2:53:57] TjFoles: noooo way
[2:53:57] revERROR: she is shit
[2:53:59] jamessonjewmcgee: u know who hasn’t dome well as VP is Kamala Harris lol uhnDead

[2:54:00] Bakemaan: 100%
[2:54:00] Senna_Minxy: Yes
[2:54:01] kaeleirra: Yes
[2:54:02] CapnCrunch301: YES

[2:54:06] AnalgesicPM: She has some batshit ideas - but she is a functioning adult
[2:54:17] sovsol: Age is relevant.. always
[2:54:19] trippinleftyHD: they all have bat shit ideas
[2:54:22] Bakemaan: its fucked
[2:54:24] Bakemaan: lol
[2:54:24] Senna_Minxy: I'm tired of 70+ yr olds running for office who can't remember what they need to say or where to go
[2:54:25] demonbeast6969: to be honest no matter who gets picked its just to corrupt
[2:54:25] Terr0rBytes: I think age is very relevant in top level politics
[2:54:26] kaeleirra: I think she can do more for the young Americans more than the old fucks
[2:54:27] Leviwest: @uhSnow I feel weneed someoen in charge not to old but not young ether
[2:54:29] L0va: I have a minor in political science
[2:54:30] tuckaa: parts of the Republican Party is slowly turning into the communist party and that’s what alot of us Americans don’t see
[2:54:33] VolenoVehro: It's good to know about other politics at a surface level at least.
[2:54:34] revERROR: yeah she is delusional
[2:54:36] mr_punx_204: Its been a good while since I watched but What happened to your cop character Snow ???
[2:54:39] CapnCrunch301: Less extremist than trump
[2:54:41] a_crutch: not a dictatorship
[2:54:42] mister_wrecked: I think age is relevant for the presidency honestly. Too young or too old means you're probably out of touch with most of the country.
[2:54:46] MadzDotGG: the UK's fucked thats all i know
[2:54:47] thepwnographer: 100% delusional
[2:54:54] Scriix: She's massively anti union
[2:54:54] Comis19: I am sick of old people out of touch with the future running the government
[2:54:56] L0va: closer to a moderate, but at least predictable unlike Trump
[2:55:02] Kenderssss: they are all Delusional
[2:55:02] revERROR: she has switched up on her stances and says america isnt racist
[2:55:10] TheHairyCheeto: age and healthy mental state is all American's are asking for at this point
[2:55:11] DanLGG: We’re all fucked here UK USA it really doesn’t matter lol.
[2:55:21] sovsol: Unions are the only reason we get labor rights in the US
