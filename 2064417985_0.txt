[1:45:08] pumpconnoisseur: unless she lost sight of the car before it stopped her testimony should be enough to prove he was driving
[1:45:09] Linarino: Awkward
[1:45:09] vegaobscura: @malicepoker No, it's honestly just a weird mechanics argument that is only exacerbated by the headpop potential
[1:45:12] AntiFusion: he "could" be operating as dispatch
[1:45:16] SistematicalNoDestroyer: he was detained for investigation no?
[1:45:19] Leroy_86: Congrats on the 6 years @kyle

[1:46:31] RetepYalc: this is YOUR fault Kyle Madge
[1:46:33] sterowentUS: Sadding kyle, be her mentor
[1:46:37] 8BitRickk: I don't think he was in the wrong. Cops have arrested for less.
[1:46:40] vegaobscura: @malicepoker Because Kyle mentioned potential fruit and she's been burned by that in court before. ONX judicial is a little different from NP
[1:46:41] tinori: Poor Apple
[1:46:45] Oppositeness: this actually is kyle's fault
[1:46:52] DamnYoni: Atleast someone is questioning other officers arrests maybe kyle pred should play at night lol

[1:47:34] weaselinap: she derails herself harder than thrive that dirty little weaselman does
[1:47:46] Frakkles: No, he said it was fruit of the poisonous tree. He didn't say you couldn't get PC in other ways.
[1:47:49] wottiv: is Nancy ok? LUL
[1:47:55] MajicAfro: she said she was inches behind the car the whole time. Pred asks how do you know he’s the driver LUL
[1:47:59] Erigzback: All that was said is you can't just drop the charge that was PC for the stop.
[1:48:02] tedium7: Madge YOU SAID
[1:48:05] littlejon3: Being the only person in the car doesn't prove he was driving, but having a set of keys that fit the vehicle does???
[1:48:08] lundo2fundo: Poor apple
[1:48:10] malicepoker: OK. Made an observation on her speaking. Was an opinion, and seemed to be right to see how people get defensive in the wrong.
[1:48:10] vegaobscura: @Dapz_01 I've noticed that this PD asks people why they did things after the fact instead of advising what to do in the moment. I think it's lead to some tough situations
[1:48:11] Phitness_: Kyle putting doubt in someones head then he's like HUH
[1:48:13] Quynton: Kyle talks her out of the arrest, then turns it around lol
[1:48:14] CosmicDrain: just hug her and say sorry
