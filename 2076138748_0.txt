[2:35:28] TimmayHS: he kinda got fucked tbh, he had to do all the work while they're both gone and also he has to push their collective agenda
[2:35:28] Riqui__: You can only hold up such a facade for so long though
[2:35:29] ShinJay87: No one is faked out from it though
[2:35:29] RyinTwitch: NODDERS
[2:35:31] m4l1kkk: The propaganda was dookie 😂😂😂
[2:35:31] Caeros: pre-recorded is crazy, good one chat
[2:35:31] ViewbotReportingforDuty: so then we now we make only 1 captain and more seniors?
[2:35:37] ViewbotReportingforDuty: I see how it is now
[2:35:37] Athasin: Yeah... the front failed, that front failed so hard
[2:35:38] MuddyHog12: honestly feel bad for slacks
[2:35:39] chen094: a united front looks like a much stronger front
[2:35:40] Mark14____: like the politics we have in today’s world
[2:35:40] tquidtv: It worked for awhile a little slacks is great character though
[2:35:41] DaiKi_gg: their false wall of "everything is good "is cracking and by now some pieces fell of as well @Deansocool
[2:35:42] Tenkaru: Right
[2:35:42] cartim33: constantly

[2:35:50] Haffsack: so so much going on it’s impossible to keep track of everything
[2:35:54] LeonardoDiCaprisun_: Fax and no one does it for him back
[2:35:55] beekay_tv: from an RP perspective Slacks seems to want good and loyal to his other captains
[2:35:55] joalona: If Ruth somehow does come back, she'll just be the joke of the pd
[2:35:56] owlx7: He's like the white knight sent to death all the time by Ruth
[2:35:59] qrcd_vv: @ghostdogg69 NAHH
[2:36:00] chaosproductions: Abbbb solutely
[2:36:01] Gundaree: taking the heat from a point of loyalty but loyalty has to come from both ways
[2:36:03] KharnFlakes_: Like how long they can keep the facade up
[2:36:05] Leritt: I just don't feel like Slacks is consistent character
[2:36:09] RexPappa: he really did, but at the same time didnt have the balls to make decisions
[2:36:09] chmbrs: he takes ALL the heat for ruth and turner when they arent around to do things
[2:36:13] ChocolateMassage: done a lot AINTNAURWAY
[2:36:13] KharnFlakes_: Its already breaking
[2:36:15] meatlove69: BRO take so many hit
[2:36:15] SpiritEX: They build the great wall in the middle of mexico not on the border
[2:36:15] p_m3ah: he’s trying to ERP with Ruth
[2:36:17] TimmayHS: bro they all of a sudden just decided that seniors get an equal vote in a HC review... but not all seniors, just the stacked ones against the person?
[2:36:17] JakeStratic: Its all a trick. Pretty Slacks solo fired Johnson. He drives a lot of this and is now pretending like it is only a facade
[2:36:19] LeonardoDiCaprisun_: 20+ years 😂😂😂😂
[2:36:21] gilboylfc1990: what happened to cornwood

[2:54:14] howyaben: @Nahsta Well they're not going to find anything since the captains have been communicating via email about almost everything serious
[2:54:20] sticks26: @wijj99 can't argue against that but when you're a lawyer/judge/government employee obviously you'll be seen as more innocent

[3:20:37] temrob: if all gi equipment is criminal possession then yea
[3:20:37] slight621: It would set a bad precedence if she doesn't get charged
[3:20:37] redbeerdx: it needs to say "knowingly" possesses
[3:20:38] DaOneBeanster: They gonna bias there way out f this one
[3:20:40] Athasin: @RonJon Doubt doesn't matter, K's case proved that.
[3:20:40] xtc_hades: in this case ramee was right cz cornwood doesnt know if u can get chest armors from other then pd
[3:20:40] RiS4n: @Deansocool Can yall do a Jayson an Dean colab song
[3:20:42] Blizzard5050: Cornwood needs to be a judge and fix this nonsense
[3:20:42] Zorgc: letter of the law btw KEKW
[3:20:42] DanLGG: there’s not enough to prove it was planted unless she tells them exactly what happened and +100 to her for giving crumbs
[3:20:42] Nadeflow: gsr positive she a THUUUG
[3:20:44] MDM4ever1986HD: Mr K's DNA wasn't on the gun tho
[3:20:45] PacGamer: Charge it and they appeal it?
[3:20:46] Wazjig: @zk_286 it is, in the description it mentions Chest Armor and armor plates
[3:20:46] Witzz_: the precedent has been set so they technically have to charge her
[3:20:47] wijj99: if there is any justice yeah but we'll see
[3:20:56] watsondubbox: she a thUUUUg mhm
[3:20:56] SeaOfEmpty: All they have to do is add a incap or forced exception to all charges and let it play in court
[3:20:56] MDM4ever1986HD: YEP
[3:20:59] Blootered: hey @Deansocool looking good today deansoHeart2
[3:21:00] Zorgc: look what x did KEKW
[3:21:03] espeiranza: she is not a loyer
[3:21:03] Blizzard5050: she’s neither
[3:21:03] akonv3: ramee fan or hater?
[3:21:03] csteele2020: it’s even weirded cuz she calls cornwood and police call Xavier Monroe to prosecute lol
[3:21:05] blowaways: this is about armour that cornwood confiscated off ramee.
[3:21:05] Leritt: doesnt change anything
[3:21:07] VH_KRIEG: she hold it she shot she dna
[3:21:07] Blizzard5050: she’s a paralegal
[3:21:08] MrSirDudeGuyBro: yh she was gsr mr k wasnt
[3:21:10] ebos22: the ruling against Mr k means they have to charge her
[3:21:10] Zedael: Her DNA would be on it though she shot
[3:21:11] idreamdouchy: But she used the gun?
[3:21:11] csteele2020: weirder*
[3:21:12] Athasin: @RonJon The judge's ruling stated that it's the letter of the law situation. Doubt is irrevelant.
[3:21:12] zk_286: not really she shot the gun
[3:21:12] Navigator_Nav: @HegoDamask99 cant she has possesion and a judge ruled as such. even when there is probable cause there is planting they have to prove it in court.
[3:21:14] outlawpickle: k got stuck with the charge because the defense failed to establish a proper timeline to create reasonable doubt.  this case she has a timeline with witnesses, including a cop who saw the hostages in the same vehicle description in the area she said
[3:21:15] Hypnovile: if not the system is rig ?
[3:21:18] Cheexur: @deansocool i feel like judges messed up cuz only judge on letter of the law and not spirit of the law
[3:21:19] Chummy_Bear: how would it save her? she gave DNa and only hers is on scene
[3:21:22] Tsithik: how would dna help if they are forced to touch and fire the gun
[3:21:22] Rivath: handing a gun doesn't generate dna
[3:21:23] TheOGWombat: there was no dna on the gun even after her holding and shooting it
[3:21:23] xtc_hades: she a paralegal
[3:21:24] Africannibal: Mr K had no felonies before before being charged with that possession charge so he was in a similar situation and even had a better case with a negative GSR test
[3:21:35] iMarks: i doubt she will, her story is pretty solid
[3:21:35] xtc_hades: and she had the gun in yer hand
[3:21:43] Zorgc: -100k RIPBOZO
[3:21:45] red_eyed_jed1: RIPBOZO
[3:21:47] Purecrew: Reasonable doubt doesnt matter with how the letter of the law is being enforced
[3:21:47] more_parrots: @xtc_hades was
[3:21:49] GravieGurl: @Africannibal yeah, this is crazy
[3:21:51] MDM4ever1986HD: RIPBOZO
[3:21:52] Blizzard5050: they can just not charge her
[3:21:56] Zorgc: -100k create new character bish RIPBOZO
[3:21:56] funkie: They will push it as long as they can, the laws will change too knowingly in possession and she won't be charged, BUT that will open up a new ball park cause now everyone can say oh that's not mine , I didn't k know that was on me that was a plant and judge will have fun 50/50 cointoss
[3:21:58] Riqui__: @Purecrew this
[3:21:58] kronostw: Doubt she will get charged. Court is guilty until proven innocent for Crims and always innocent for civs, especially lawyers or judges.
[3:22:02] blowaways: judges need to amend the law cause the law is dumb.
[3:22:02] Basard21: her story is solid and there are 2 other victims of the kidnapping that can corroborate it
[3:22:03] howyaben: I don't think she gets paid for being a paralegal either
[3:22:03] handgunhartz: Smokin that Ruth and mild
[3:22:04] DanLGG: No dna is irrelevant. Her story is the only thing that can save her and there’s no evidence.
[3:22:05] zk_286: gsr positive as well if they drop charge basically a slap in face for both other cases
[3:22:10] phrostieflakes: id bet money a judge will change the pace of the rulings on this one
[3:22:10] ModernMilk: Funny thing about that paralegal is how blatant she was towards Mr.Ks character calling him guilty and a criminal during the court trial
[3:22:11] Nadeflow: crane next ooooo
[3:22:11] lemmytunngainus: they can
[3:22:14] Navigator_Nav: Reasonable doubt was not enough according to judge. She is fucked. Also she is the prosecutor in K's case and as such the cause of this case law
[3:22:14] ramsin50: they can do it later
[3:22:16] owlx7: how did they remove DNA from the gun?
[3:22:17] Blizzard5050: full clip
[3:22:17] CyboargTV: Yeah they have to, they've set a precident
[3:22:20] eatcheese0: DNA is scuffed. only applies if you pick it up from the ground
[3:22:21] eliteone11: Mr K gonna go on the biggest spree ever if they dont charge her
[3:22:21] Africannibal: @Basard21 They got ocean dumped I think
[3:22:21] diermo: they need to charge for the precedent or its fucked
[3:22:24] zk_286: cornwood is saying they can choose not to charge
[3:22:24] MrSirDudeGuyBro: and she only a legal aid
[3:22:26] TheOGWombat: shes “new in town”
[3:22:26] RoryBear: can cops just wait out the 30 days?
[3:22:26] sneed3m: if they dont charge her then surely they have to revisit mr K's case
[3:22:27] Jecikalba: axeumBlush
[3:22:27] riiftzzz: they have 30 days
[3:22:27] Kalious78: @wazjig it's in the description but there's no identification on it to prove it wasn't crafted/bought elsewhere
[3:22:28] MaverickAA2100: everyone that saw went for a siwm too LUL
[3:22:30] ConmanEU: reasonable doubt about kidnap has nothing to do with possession of gov firarm
[3:22:31] knutnhuny: they're going to make this apart of the missing 8 PD guns case, not her own case alone
[3:22:33] SulhBatarnak: hell murphy a judge got fucked
[3:22:33] goilers9: who are we talking about just joined
[3:22:37] TheOGWombat: could be an apex serial killer
[3:22:37] Cheexur: just wait until crane get as found with one lmfaooooo
[3:22:38] ramsin50: why wasn't mr k dna not on the gun
[3:22:38] Blizzard5050: That’s only if she is charged thiugh
[3:22:38] blowaways: this is Ks point. it was stupid precedent
[3:22:40] xtc_hades: @more_parrots Facts
[3:22:40] DanLGG: She was part of setting the precedent
[3:22:43] kCblol: i think it opens up appeal if they dont
[3:22:45] wijj99: exactly
[3:22:45] palace93: the armour and flashlight is a bit of a weird one because it doesn’t say pd on it or anything
[3:22:46] kbrewskies: they absolutely should charge her but if some bs happens I would not be surprised
[3:22:46] Tsithik: until K or somebody starts planting on council members they aint gonna change no laws i dont think
[3:22:46] TheeMikeSmith: I hope they do....or thats just messed up
[3:22:51] daedayz: she a paralegal and her voice mad annoying, they gotta charge her
[3:22:52] VexV1: abilene contralto
[3:22:52] pukanacua: 100 clips left Aware
[3:22:53] bosschar95: what a dadgum shit show last night was
[3:22:55] STG_Loudpack: el no sabe
[3:22:56] wordswurst: they have 30 days to sit on it
[3:22:58] maofinn: yea the precedent for it to be fake exist too tho
[3:23:01] MDM4ever1986HD: @pukanacua 44
[3:23:04] diermo: yeah its affirmative defense, so reasonable doubt doesnt even matter @Deansocool
[3:23:04] Zorgc: im blaming x on this one KEKW
[3:23:05] Zunnun: deansoSpin
[3:23:05] TenseTokki: Officers can have thier own discretion on charges and choose what to push tho
[3:23:06] Basard21: this is why max is pushing to pardon k at the next council meeting
[3:23:08] SeaOfEmpty: There is discretion, but it would burn the city to not charge her
[3:23:09] lzrdwzrdtv: @Chummy_Bear she was stabbed tho what is the explanation for that
[3:23:09] OldOhana: didn’t crane say nothing has set precedent yet? like no case yet
[3:23:10] Oronyx: This was the judges fault to be fair, they have to stick to the precedent
[3:23:10] iMarks: well if the guns Serial code comes back to one of the 8 guns that were stolen that day, she wont get charged
[3:23:13] PacGamer: Yeah K should have won that case
[3:23:17] flensost: What if they wait with pressing charges to see if more guns show up? if they all have the same dna on them it could easily seed doubt about a plant
[3:23:21] DanLGG: stupid or not they have to charge her imo
[3:23:22] HegoDamask99: thing is K wins either way, they either stick with it and prove his point, or not charge her and he's discriminated essentially
[3:23:22] wijj99: it started from the JP case and went all the way to this point
[3:23:23] CyboargTV: The law will get reworked and honestly on K's runback of the case he SHOULD get cleaned
[3:23:24] Nadeflow: if they pick n choose who to charge on possession then thats hella weird
[3:23:26] SpiritEX: @Tsithik council is allowed to use this
[3:23:27] JimmyNewf: does adilene stream?
[3:23:27] ObnoxiousNinja7: @maofinn But someone has to come forward to take the blame like X did.
[3:23:28] blowaways: judges are meant to decide, cops aren't
[3:23:29] TenseTokki: Lol fair point
[3:23:30] Leritt: If they dont charge her within few days PD will be biased af
[3:23:32] Chummy_Bear: Yeah k used the fact that DNA only applies when you hold/ give a gun so she is kinda fucked on that. Has a GSR Postive, unless cops suddenly change how they have been charging they should charge her.
[3:23:34] cvarim: They know K gonna plant another gun, so they will collect all 6 guns and dont charge anyone
[3:23:39] espeiranza: they have no reason to charge her even her story is solid and evidence match her story
[3:23:40] VexV1: people also got dapped for not pushing enough charges
[3:23:40] Leritt: In light of recent court cases they have to charge her
[3:23:40] lemmytunngainus: that was different lol KEKW
[3:23:42] blowaways: cops push charges they discover. judges decide if they're valid
[3:23:43] Newname_5: duncan got dapped too for not enough charges @Deansocool LUL
[3:23:47] ramsin50: that's not the same
[3:23:48] eatcheese0: @Nadeflow happens irl no?
[3:23:49] Ravic0n: biggest thing i think is the gun was stolen like 6grs earlier and all those reports say a male suspect.
[3:23:51] Witzz_: @iMarks this doesnt matter in the charge, its just the possession and the precedent for this charge is regardless of if its put on you, its still posession
[3:23:52] xtc_hades: @imarks yeah but she could have stole it from the pd
[3:23:57] who_sun: at the same time Slacks gave 21 years to a guy for accomplice
[3:23:57] VH_KRIEG: aaight let continue slowpoke
[3:23:57] Rivath: K's story wasn't believable and there were witnesses saying he had a gun
[3:24:03] Tsithik: @SpiritEX regular civ weapons not PD guns
[3:24:07] Athasin: @outlawpickle That's BS, K not only established a timeline, had a witness claiming his innocent, was GSR negative (so no constructive possession), had another named party to to blame, and had the cops admit on stand that they failed to investigate the other party.
[3:24:08] phrostieflakes: @Deansocool seems like people think this ruling was set with K's case but quickly forget it was murphy's case first
[3:24:10] Blizzard5050: Exactly
[3:24:14] Cheexur: but the robbers could of sold it @deansocool
[3:24:19] jaredfranz_: exactly
[3:24:20] more_parrots: a PD weapon can be sold or given to someone else
[3:24:22] Floo94: wat
[3:24:22] espeiranza: it mean's nothing they can sell it
[3:24:23] KKumare: no, because the law is for holding the weapon. the weapon could be sold.
[3:24:23] diermo: People keep saying reasonable doubt, when judges establish it doesnt matter. Its an affirmative defense, she needs to prove it was planted, which she cant @Deansocool
[3:24:24] Blizzard5050: That’s what they were saying
[3:24:25] kronostw: DNA is a pretty dumb mechanic for the server. Most crims would use gloves to not get their prints on the weapon...hopefully they add that to the server somehow
[3:24:26] Carmine_steel: yeah but they can be sold
[3:24:28] Navigator_Nav: Masks , so objection wierd
[3:24:28] TenseTokki: Does the raid of her house turning up nothing help her case I'm wondering?
[3:24:28] HegoDamask99: that doesn't matter, still has possession, that only matters if the crime was for robbery
[3:24:29] owlx7: How did K remove DNA from the gun to give it to her?
[3:24:30] howyaben: Body type ID LULW
[3:24:30] chmod_R_777: balaclava
[3:24:32] blowaways: that's also k's point. on his case there was zero effort to investigate, and now they're doing everythig to prove her innocence.
[3:24:32] garbagoo: yes but in reality they could have sold the gun cash
[3:24:35] Athasin: @Deansocool Cash
[3:24:36] ConmanEU: change the law to 'knowling' poss a gove gun otherwise she has to be charged
[3:24:37] wijj99: with cash
[3:24:37] Leritt: She bought it for 10$
[3:24:37] Emeralblade: Can't do that unfortunatly. She could have bought it with cash?
[3:24:38] Nadeflow: @eatcheese0 yea this rp with streamers werird ahh
[3:24:39] bakerjok88: what’s going on
[3:24:39] DanLGG: That’s where you could establish reasonable doubt
[3:24:39] Cheexur: @deansocool but the charge is possession
[3:24:39] TheeMikeSmith: cash
[3:24:39] Blizzard5050: Beric LITERALLY saw her held hostage
[3:24:40] Bballallan: cash
[3:24:40] zk_286: she could be in there gang
[3:24:40] kCblol: @owlx7 his dna not on file
[3:24:42] Witzz_: @owlx7 K dna isnt on file anyways
[3:24:42] ramsin50: could be with crypto
[3:24:44] more_parrots: sold for $1
[3:24:45] Navigator_Nav: Cannot do that, objection wierd.
[3:24:47] KKumare: they didnt question on Ks case, how he got the weapon, its just about he HAS the weapon.
[3:24:49] hosseinfel: with washed cash
[3:24:49] Dr_Epica: cornwood
[3:24:50] Rivath: @owlx7 DNA doesn't present when you give someone something
[3:24:50] Biggysnipes: bank records dont exist yet, cant use it
[3:24:50] TheeMikeSmith: cornwood
[3:24:50] ObnoxiousNinja7: But it doesn't matter though. Could be sold for mats, washed cash, etc.
[3:24:51] Bballallan: crims
[3:24:52] n8dogg03: me :)
[3:24:52] ramsin50: what about butcoin
[3:24:53] Athasin: @Deansocool Denzel does
[3:24:53] Wild_Shiny_Absol: Cornman
[3:24:53] Rxssss: if u know about butcoin  trade alos in game
[3:24:54] bosschar95: w as hed c a s h
[3:24:54] Gh0stPog: how do you know she don't have illegal cash laying around
[3:24:54] espeiranza: cornwood
[3:24:55] yettimode: could be traded for a turbo or something
[3:24:56] owlx7: ahh thanks guys
[3:24:56] twilightbaseballscene: cornwood
[3:24:58] Kalious78: Mr K is picking the wrong people to do it to, he could set up other dodgy people the police would 100% charge instead of the prosecutors judges and council members
[3:24:59] zk_286: she could be in there group
[3:25:00] RisKkeyy: Dundee is like 60k negative and still has cash
[3:25:01] froogo0: LUL This is the LSPD that we're talking about here. It's currenly so dysfunctional that even routine patrols don't work well.
[3:25:01] OldOhana: could have been a favor no need for a exchange of money
[3:25:02] TenseTokki: I could id cornwood by body type LUL
[3:25:04] TheOGWombat: that da in Atlanta is cash queen lol
[3:25:04] blowaways: the point is cases need to be investigated properly before charges are applied
[3:25:06] twilightbaseballscene: could trade services
[3:25:07] Cheexur: charge is possession no matter what
[3:25:07] TheeMikeSmith: LMAO
[3:25:07] SeaOfEmpty: Could make cash doing illegal stuff
[3:25:08] Gh0stPog: nope
[3:25:08] KKumare: :D
[3:25:12] lzrdwzrdtv: LOL WHAT A GOAT
[3:25:13] kCblol: @Kalious78 this is facts...
[3:25:14] garbagoo: I mean shit id be lying if I said I haven't bought a $200 bike for $20 off some random who def stole that ish
[3:25:17] ramsin50: doesn't he have a phone
[3:25:18] SoggyM0uth: @demento1337 u back ?
[3:25:20] sour______: thats word
[3:25:21] illuwe: how many minutes left i need to poop too
[3:25:21] Riqui__: cant that man watch on his phone while pooping?
[3:25:22] BDG_parth28: deansoWeird deansoWeird deansoWeird
[3:25:22] tonychuleta: can we see the shit ?
[3:25:22] AndHaka54: you should try to become a lawyer too like aziz, the knowledge pd earn can be used when you go back to pd
[3:25:22] Clivent: Waiting
[3:25:23] SargentNavi: ur such a g
[3:25:23] Dr_Epica: you actually are? LuL
[3:25:23] wijj99: she could've got the cash from somewhere. A lot of people store cash at he appartments not at the bank
[3:25:23] budlizzy826: She did knowingly posses the gun and she also shot the gun
[3:25:24] Navigator_Nav: @Kalious78 Got to get who you can get
[3:25:24] Emeralblade: washed... cash... lol (sorry cornwood rolling joke)
[3:25:25] Athasin: Could've sold it for rolls
[3:25:25] Its_yagirl_Layni: @kCblol Also didn't touch the gun or shoot
[3:25:25] FeelsMelancholyMan: they just never deposit their paychecks
[3:25:25] daedayz: cornwood and ruth keep their cash in lockers. they really the same
[3:25:26] Tsithik: tell his ass to watch on mobile lmao
[3:25:27] TG_Light: that ain't no poo man
[3:25:27] DanLGG: I fucks with it. let’s keep discussing
[3:25:28] HegoDamask99: @garbagoo thats crazy LULW
[3:25:31] mauimakani: wait who don’t shit with they phone
[3:25:33] unknownpumkin: Doesnt matter when k was told possession is 9/10th of the law on pd gun
[3:25:33] Athasin: Could've sold with butcoin
[3:25:38] LongDongSilverrr13: don’t flame genuine question tf does based mean
[3:25:42] brandonpotter123: buttcoin for gun transaction?
[3:25:43] marneraiders: @deansocool Did Denzel talk to the Mayors Office or the People doing the review yet ?
[3:25:44] garbagoo: @HegoDamask99 welcome to detroit
[3:25:45] diermo: there is no reasonable doubt for PD gun charges, its on the defense side to prove it was planted. Its auto assumed guilty for that charge
[3:25:46] ObnoxiousNinja7: @Kalious78 Doing it to other crims would be kinda low balling. Lawyers and Judges are the one causing this issue.
[3:25:46] EwLumi: there’s loads of people who only keep cash on the server
[3:25:48] espeiranza: keep money outside of bank is good for crims
[3:25:50] AndreSays: @kCblol regardless it plants the seed of doubt that it can happen to anyone due to the precedent that was set
[3:25:51] TenseTokki: Does this chatter not have the twitch mobile app FailFish
[3:25:51] OldOhana: how do you feel about Denzel prestiging his DAP points @deansocool
[3:25:53] MIDDLEGROUNDZER0: if they don't charge her then the law won't ever change, it needs to be brought to court more often until they change the wording of the law.
[3:25:56] Codex88: what did she shoot with the gun
[3:26:03] owlx7: @kCblol if it's not on file.. the dna should  still be on the gun ?  just as unknown? how did they give the gun to her without touch?
[3:26:05] ramsin50: only weirdos don't take their phones to the bathroom
[3:26:05] more_parrots: the only way she can fight it is through appeal after she's charged
[3:26:07] howyaben: yeah that's kinda unfortunate
[3:26:09] TheOGWombat: “psycho serial killer moves to town and hides in plain sight as paralegal to choose victims “
[3:26:10] budlizzy826: K really just wanna proove a point
[3:26:11] sour______: denzel n cornwood should have a vigilante arc
[3:26:11] Witzz_: The problem with this case is they already set a precedent of   regardless of how you got in possession of the PD firearm, you are still in possession of it. That is the problem and its the fault of the DOJ for doing this.
[3:26:13] Ferfind69: where those DNA cleaning kits
[3:26:18] BDG_parth28: @mauimakani  I never take my phone in bathrooms , i save alot of time
[3:26:18] Fossabot: If your enjoying the stream smash the DAMN follow button! I mean shit its just a click away... Might see your name on screen ;)
[3:26:20] predzz_: I wanna see her not get charged, just to see what K does after hearing about it (:
[3:26:22] espeiranza: you need to some civ jobs wit hcornwood
[3:26:24] DanLGG: Bro other ppl gave a better explanation of ur situation than Denzel lol
[3:26:25] PsychoJoker: He usually comes around at like 3pm PST but with Final Fantasy coming out today and early copys going out who knows
[3:26:27] blowaways: they just want everyone (crim or civ) to be treated fairly
[3:26:31] novariie: he wanted to talk to denzel
[3:26:34] Cheexur: @deansocool the issue is if they change the law then it will be difficult to push these charges because everyone who gets found with a gun will not be charged. its a catch 22
[3:26:37] Navigator_Nav: If Ramee had a bar licence he would prosecute all these planted gun charges. Can you imagine? @Deansocool
[3:26:38] Kalious78: @navigator_nav no he has a list, thing is he could set up 6 crims they 100% charge and video each time. Wait till there all charged and give the lawyers the tapes to show there innocent
[3:26:40] kCblol: @owlx7 it can still be on the gun and if K dna ever comes on file they could match it. DNA is 100% though and doesn't always show, so that could happen too
[3:26:42] AnusReaktorMan: Yap
[3:26:43] marneraiders: so you only talked to Jenny ? Not the other three ?
[3:26:44] eatcheese0: @owlx7 DNA is scuffed. even when it was released you have to pick it up from the ground. mr K never did
[3:26:45] FaahQ2: imagine her being found with another PD gun later this week
[3:26:45] Goldenmaw: How would you go about changing precedent? Would you have to reverse the original ruling?
[3:26:46] Zeldeza: If Cornwood ever got his sheriff's office, would Denzel transfer there?
[3:26:47] diermo: @Witzz_ exactly, reasonable doubt doesnt matter. Its guilty until innocent charge on victim side to prove 100% planted
[3:26:51] AndreSays: from my perspective Ssaab has been assuming that it's Mr K doing all of it. So that means any other RP'er could do this and easily pin it on Mr K
[3:26:51] VH_KRIEG: if she aint gon get charged its hell month
[3:26:52] twilightbaseballscene: if den is doing shift 2 he’s gonna be up later going forward anyway right
[3:26:52] KKumare: as they like to say "per letter" of the law, shes guilty
[3:26:53] Athasin: @more_parrots Nah, once she's charged it's a wrap because the judge has set the precedent that possession is possession, constructive possession just doesn't seem to exist
[3:26:57] RisKkeyy: @theogwombat yeah ya never know “psycho serial killer moves to town and hides in plain sight as paralegal to choose victims “
[3:27:00] AnusReaktorMan: @draxler077 when you talked to jenny?
[3:27:08] hosseinfel: no one

[3:27:08] Kalious78: Murphy
[3:27:09] x_juiceman: No it’s not “regardless” if you have a reason that you can prove then you don’t get charged.
[3:27:10] VH_KRIEG: murphy
[3:27:10] Gh0stPog: merfy
[3:27:10] kCblol: nobody

[3:27:18] ramsin50: murphy
[3:27:19] HFxH34DHUNT3R: JP confessed to planting the gun on murphy
[3:27:19] Marlbrah: Murphy, only because X confessed
[3:27:20] ObnoxiousNinja7: X covered Murph
[3:27:20] wijj99: Murphy won JUST BACAUSE X confessed @Deansocool
[3:27:20] more_parrots: X confessed after statue of limitations
[3:27:20] jwou11: braun got charge reversed
[3:27:21] DaditudeGaming: Murphy did
[3:27:22] onlyicxrus: braun did
[3:27:23] diermo: X confessed
[3:27:23] Athasin: Braun only was innocent because JP confessed
[3:27:23] HegoDamask99: murphy got away with it after x confession
[3:27:23] who_sun: XQC confessed the plenting
[3:27:24] Chummy_Bear: murphy won his second appeal because X said he did it
[3:27:24] muppetfartt: murph a judge again
[3:27:25] Kalious78: Murphy braun did I thought
[3:27:26] DanLGG: No one. Braun was overturned because JP admitted he set him up
[3:27:26] knutnhuny: they are going to hold off on charging her for 30 days, in that time all 8 guns will be planted on different people, it will be obvious that it was a plan to plant guns on people, at that point
[3:27:27] ModernMilk: Braun got cleared because X confessed
[3:27:27] xtc_hades: murphy
[3:27:28] zk_286: jp confessed
[3:27:28] kCblol: murphy's appeal didnt work, x had to confess
[3:27:30] VH_KRIEG: murphy.. eventuall after alot o time
[3:27:31] Navigator_Nav: @Deansocool  only mayor can change the outcome with pardon
[3:27:31] TheOGWombat: this is a solid way to rp out ooc law loopholes
[3:27:33] chronicfuels: she will 100% get the possession charge.
[3:27:33] Zorgc: i already told, look what x did omE
[3:27:34] xtc_hades: cz x admitted to it
[3:27:35] Triist0ne: Murphy got exonorated later
[3:27:36] blowaways: the point is judges should create new precedent to make better laws
[3:27:39] sneed3m: noone got away with it. murphy was spared because X conceded and admitted to planting it on murphy
[3:27:41] diermo: confession got Murphy appealed but before that it was wraps
[3:27:42] blockabull: CHAT Murphy was pardoned, no?
[3:27:44] AndreSays: letter of the law is the precedent that was if there is any doubt
[3:27:46] Rxssss: murphy got pardon pretty sure
[3:27:51] more_parrots: bobby charles can give a fake confession to save her
[3:27:53] owlx7: @kCblol ahh kk thanks.  DNA seems scuffed, if the last person's DNA overwrites the old ones
[3:27:55] Athasin: @blockabull No
[3:27:56] sliwoski_: yurrrrrr
[3:27:57] Ferfind69: Yaeger could confess to get K pardon
[3:27:58] Astro_Az_: But that's equipment though not a firearm
[3:28:00] Fadekiller007: x is goated lol, guy causing all sorts of chaos
[3:28:01] Riqui__: that man has to be done pooping by now
[3:28:03] MexiBrent: Hes a judge again
[3:28:08] Witzz_: the DOJ fucked over everyone by setting this precedent
[3:28:14] AndreSays: BASED
[3:28:16] chmod_R_777: so did Mr K
[3:28:19] heftylefty_prime: Mr.K would need to confess in 30 days.
[3:28:20] blowaways: this is about a separate incident btw
[3:28:22] aoc_bae: BASED CORNWOOD
[3:28:23] Cheexur: @deansocool but in her case there isn’t any doubt around her situation
[3:28:23] AnusReaktorMan: +dap
[3:28:24] Leritt: esfand is wrong here in my opinion
[3:28:24] MrSirDudeGuyBro: @ferfind69 Yeager ain't gonna do that
[3:28:28] BLazOR_Prime: @Rxssss no he didnt, X confessed, Murphy put in an appeal after the cofession, the cops did no contest and the charges were dropped and he was exonerrated
[3:28:29] HegoDamask99: BASED
[3:28:32] 95eagles: W
[3:28:34] pukanacua: HYPERCLAP
[3:28:34] scaeriel: u gonna get a ooc dap
[3:28:34] Chummy_Bear: it would be shocking if she did not get charged. this should go to court and hopefully a judge sees the bs and sets new precedent on gun law
[3:28:36] jy33130: saabDap
[3:28:37] owlx7: BASED
[3:28:37] scaeriel: Clap

[3:28:37] RyinTwitch: Clap
[3:28:38] MDM4ever1986HD: based Clap
[3:28:38] RisKkeyy: But it's not "pd chest armor"
[3:28:39] MrDher: HOLY BASED
[3:28:41] Enoobrac: Esfand yoinked that armor off Ramee from 20 feet away LMFAO
[3:28:41] red_eyed_jed1: LSPD is the fun police
[3:28:45] AndreSays: Is PD not pushing charges on Cornwood now due to the shit storm?
[3:28:48] Riqui__: Den moved to April academyn for clapping
[3:28:49] PsychoJoker: Hes not wrong
[3:28:49] Athasin: Even if he hadn't done that, Cornwood would've had to prove that the chest armor came from the PD.
[3:28:56] jackxanxcoke: true
[3:28:57] more_parrots: he'd be on emote all day only mode if he does that
[3:28:57] Nadeflow: ruth take notes PepeLaugh
[3:28:57] muppetfartt: i feel like the cops are gonna try to let her slide and the mayor is going to have to step in again
[3:28:58] ShinJay87: Only bad part about this was the chest armor isn't marked as PD
[3:29:00] Tsithik: i think characters should do what they would do in spirit of RP
[3:29:00] f0rbin: i don't understand how it's bad faith?
[3:29:01] smalllittleisaac: LUL
[3:29:02] RisKkeyy: They are able to craft armor now
[3:29:06] Witzz_: Esfand isnt wrong, but that doesnt correlate to this the case with the paralegal
[3:29:08] chmod_R_777: dont send this clip to Ssbaas chat, they are by the book
[3:29:09] youngt0ph: Love Esfand :)
[3:29:09] wellbigsmoke: TRUE
[3:29:10] OldOhana: someone finds out in shift 1 incoming Insta fired for not doing police work correctly
[3:29:13] DanLGG: lowkey I think Ramee coulda beat that charge
[3:29:13] ObnoxiousNinja7: This is all on K's case. They had other people fleeing from the scene yet they immediately blamed K for it. They should've investigated K way more before charging him and raiding him.
[3:29:17] Kalious78: Lol oh they know
[3:29:17] Athasin: @AndreSays Turner still wants to push (based on the clip we saw earlier)
[3:29:18] palace93: the armour and light is a weird one because it doesn’t say pd on it
[3:29:18] Marunc: @Athasin there is no other way to have it
[3:29:22] audy: GIGACHAD ming
[3:29:23] kCblol: @Athasin the law lists the name of the chest armour, identically to what was found. it's the same case as a pd glock.
[3:29:24] Enoobrac: in the law it states that it needs to be proven it comes from PD, not sure what the hangup on that was
[3:29:25] HFxH34DHUNT3R: The fact that they took Ramee's DNA so quick and still havent taken Mr. K's is crazy to me
[3:29:26] Basard21: i think the captains knew what they wanted to do but it isnt working and are doubling down on what they want to do
[3:29:27] mrchainsaw13: real
[3:29:28] Emeralblade: not gonna lie, the way some of those charges are written are messed up. How is a flashlight "serious PD Equipment"?
[3:29:29] MrGyni: BASED
[3:29:29] audy: GIGACHAD ming = win
[3:29:35] PsychoJoker: @f0rbin because more than likely Ramee wants his lawyer to go out with a bang which he did instead of a stupid ass charge for having a CHEST PIECE on him
[3:29:45] blowaways: k wasn't involved in a violent felony though
[3:29:46] bosschar95: DAP
[3:29:46] Witzz_: @HFxH34DHUNT3R It has to be violent felony
[3:29:47] MrSirDudeGuyBro: 2x
[3:29:47] MarkV26: twice
[3:29:47] JakeStratic: I think they Capts are trying to RP something they don't actually understand how to do and it messing up their RP and making them unintentionally massively corrupt
[3:29:49] diermo: twice
[3:29:49] TheeMikeSmith: 2x

[3:29:53] ryan27kf: wasn’t dna when k got caught
[3:29:54] MDM4ever1986HD: twice
[3:29:54] VH_KRIEG: stop fucking pausing before a clip is over
[3:29:55] Nadeflow: he got violent felony no
[3:29:55] keemotherapi: @Emeralblade just because of the DNA mechanic pretty much lol

[3:37:26] chronicfuels: with no way to remove DNA that is way too overpowered
[3:37:26] Rxssss: yes
[3:37:27] chapoop_: cant u fingerprint test the mag?

[3:37:29] ramsin50: finger prints on bullets and casings would be amazing
[3:37:30] BrockLeeSwag: but we need gloves so you can do it stealthy
[3:37:30] Notorious553: most of these were PD guns, so their fingerprint

[3:37:45] iam_Syanda: multiple prints
[3:37:47] scfy: or on the gun itself when you rack it
[3:37:49] MexiBrent: has anyone tried to DNA test the casings?
[3:37:49] FeelsMelancholyMan: yeah gloves should be a counter to all dna
[3:37:50] KKumare: fingerprints, dna, next level: drones following every crime recording everything :D
[3:37:52] Tsithik: gloves should protect you from leaving dna. until they add a way to clean or prevent dna it seems incomplete
[3:37:53] ShibbityShwab: OnLoadAmmo = AddFingerPrintID(self)
[3:37:54] Descrete1: why would it matter tho? someone could give mags with bullets already in.
[3:37:55] YoMolicheu: They can just use an event, once bullets are loaded leave data

[5:04:17] LogicWeasel: the captains have no clue how that's working
[5:04:19] FvmousAce_: Feds are listening
[5:04:20] dannorexx: ironic now that the new rule is that you have to actually be at the meeting to get a vote
[5:04:22] red_eyed_jed1: @zomgeo it was before the meeting he decided it\
[5:04:25] vonderweisz: Nah they hoed Denzel either way you look at it
[5:04:25] Janman88: so only turner and slacks voted for his stay?
[5:04:26] Reuschel: The Seniors of Shift 2/3 weren't too happy either afterwards
[5:04:28] Riqui__: Dens review was just for show LUL
[5:04:33] Gn0mbat: Max ReallyMad
[5:04:33] BDG_Toa676: Ohhh
[5:04:34] Jerti_: Only because Cornwood complained that his last meeting was with shift 1 guys and not from his shift
[5:04:36] catfish_quackenbush: Seems like they learned from your issue and wanted to make things bette,r but being the captains, they fucked up that new process lol
[5:04:37] blowaways: turner voted him out
[5:04:44] LustyHeart: @Deansocool Mayor has been searching for you for DAYSSSSSSSSS
[5:04:46] slight621: Xavior should talk to Max on Den's behalf.. that would get him back in without academy
[5:04:47] esuardi: @Janman88 slacks and a rando senior
[5:04:51] NemoBlu: who that in the background?
[5:04:56] TheHoll0w: @owen_smithy99 sniper
[5:04:56] FvmousAce_: he sounded like corn for a sec

[5:05:03] LustyHeart: thats Aldo?
[5:05:03] novariie: they had already decided before you could defend yourself because you were the example lmaoo
[5:05:05] jinnytolls: They messed up by pressing charges so early
[5:05:06] LogicWeasel: can't do that to a crim, let alone Cornwood
[5:05:06] Janman88: @esuardi oh his shift 3 snr i guess
[5:05:09] m4l1kkk: Denzel had 1 person at his review, they couldn't care less 💀😂
[5:05:09] catfish_quackenbush: @Reuschel yea i knew ruby liked Big C, but she went hard on not being made aware of all this and not being involed and being left out
[5:05:15] mizzikk2401: yeah that was a good call to have Xavior there
[5:05:16] KjetilHestvik: experts assemble
[5:05:18] PsychoJoker: This is not Aldo this is Xavier Monroe
[5:05:25] LustyHeart: not this
[5:05:27] BDG_Toa676: Icl if they reinstate Denzel what the chance his dpas get reinstated too?
[5:05:34] Luthercorpz: Bruh they tried to trick Corny into coming to PD get integrated and then insta arrest him. Imagine if he went down to Slacks alone. He'd be charged wiith murder right now
[5:05:35] BDG_Toa676: *daps
[5:05:39] LogicWeasel: you wanna be there with cornwood I see
[5:05:39] Janman88: turner voting him out is wild
[5:05:40] quaylewastaken: Mayor listens
[5:05:41] Fast_doughnut: Is that Aldo in back ground chat?
[5:05:41] esuardi: @Janman88 ruths appointed snr

[5:06:18] m4l1kkk: Opinion = Insubordination = DAP
[5:06:19] LogicWeasel: LUL slacks forgot about the 12 names he gave him.
[5:06:22] Athasin: @BDG_Toa676 That's the thing, Captains (Slacks and Turner) agreed that when you come back from an indefinite you have 0 DAPs. Ruth wanted them dropped to just 5.
[5:06:23] autisticboots: @bdg_toa676 either way his daps be zero
[5:06:23] Luthercorpz: @illuwe  Wrong
[5:06:25] spookdaddi: @reuschel I’m glad ruby said something. I think if they knew they would be able to vote, they would have changed things around to try to show up
[5:06:25] catfish_quackenbush: @Janman88 he said in a talk later with slacks that he wasnt at first, but with the screaming match and talking to mayor, he voted termination
[5:06:25] LogicWeasel: during his employment review
[5:06:30] FvmousAce_: if you got fired for a pit they should check Suarez body cams
[5:06:31] Gundaree: Max has spoken with many oficers right? so Den can talk...
