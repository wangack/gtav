[0:13:19] Eku007: Yeah ..
[0:13:23] epic_smee: One disadvantage is that new characters are rough to Play. You can't really survive a day on a new characters without doing a job
[0:13:26] francis_trash: "wassup playa want to work for me for free?"

[0:17:10] Dentvis: nice mug
[0:17:17] zenwas0: but being first also dies down if you dont have the manpower to continue it
[0:17:20] francis_trash: It might be a bit meta but what do you think about AK discussing those issues w Fanny, she seems that she can be the more level headed/planner type in the group?
[0:17:32] NemisizZ: cuz its grinding
[0:17:34] meego0o: i said it, sani is the way
[0:17:42] Sylverphyre: It sucks, but once the crim reps build up and bigger crim activities come in, the others definitely earn their keep
[0:17:49] epic_smee: Fanny coasts though
[0:17:50] gostonko: bc azn NODDERS
[0:18:07] Quantumdan: sani and lumber have the most longevity out of the cv jobs
[0:18:16] ViolenceOfDucks: you get ming, you get fanny
[0:18:17] francis_trash: yeah i get what u say

[0:19:15] Paupor: You roll a new char
[0:19:15] francis_trash: He griefed himself in 3.0? Like was there a particular event?
[0:19:20] BlueishKiwi: chop 400 cars, stash them, get robbed for half
[0:19:25] Suvaacc: 4head was -2mil in 3.0 most of the time
[0:19:25] mariuspure: why felons can rent cars tho PepeLaugh

[0:19:34] epic_smee: @georges_fresh thats his rp. Fail on purpose
[0:19:37] Bro_The_Broski: @georges_fresh he spent the most time in jail of all crims
[0:19:37] ro666ert: did you guys get the electric bill btw?
[0:19:43] LePtitGrec75: Yes but 4head has the respect of all street. Almost no one will rob him
[0:19:49] carrioncorps: having a negative bank would be so grim
[0:19:53] Tiramisu_Espresso: Did the electric bill  come in ?
[0:20:01] viniblond: pretty much
[0:20:04] francis_trash: Yeah get it, his "fail on purpose rp" thanks
[0:20:12] zenwas0: i like how in 4.0 people are trying to get new things going like ming not wanting a new GG
[0:20:20] NebelKop: he did that most the time on 3.0 yeah...
[0:20:32] Eku007: He's like Harry , doesn't mind taking L's but Harry actually makes money in his grind sessions
[0:20:34] FuddelDuddel: Besties are lucky that the house is in Dez' name, so police raids seem unlikely atm
[0:20:36] mortuusintus12: @zenwas0 he's distracted with all the eRP haha
[0:20:39] Xpatrol: U could live outside the system but so restricted in interaction
[0:20:59] zenwas0: @mortuusintus12 true KEKW
[0:21:05] Sylverphyre: You think the crim side people will contribute alot once the big jobs come in?
[0:21:22] richiesays: 💪🏿👶🏿
[0:21:41] mortuusintus12: i mean yall grinded so hard to the pressure of getting a house. probably need another driving force for everyone to do something

[0:23:36] ThicccBrickBoi: @denwopp Fanny's date event made so much money it's crazy
[0:23:39] infectious37: same as RL
[0:23:42] Danifinch: 4HEAD is a hell of a rolling story and I think any streamer would want him around for that alone.
[0:23:45] mortuusintus12: time to rename the group Jamals besties and get a 69 iq member for roleplay
[0:24:15] Denwopp: yea same as Mr k's businesses and look at the rp that comes from it compared to just grinding
[0:24:20] NebelKop: true
[0:24:20] NemisizZ: its only been 2 almost 3 months of casual grinding Kappa
[0:24:24] Eku007: I watch him like 3-4 hrs before you go live and still can't figure out where his money goes
[0:24:36] yodaHn: OMEGALUL

[0:24:44] zenciny: Just buy
[0:24:45] Fishnet83: flip flopping again PauseChamp
[0:24:49] Sylverphyre: One thing I noticed, besties group is diverse and Jack of all trades, self sufficient overall. BUT that also means slower forward movement since not specialised 1 way
[0:24:55] 911_raj: G6 pays more man
[0:25:02] Suvaacc: yeah it seems atm most people with successful businesses are the ones who went very hard in the beginning and have all the access to rare bp-s. Its hard to just start new business out of smth atm that isnt saturated.
[0:25:03] adamcolas: mhm
[0:25:04] ThicccBrickBoi: Dhead on g6 grind so I doubt he will ruin his rep. Maybe lovemore
[0:25:06] 911_raj: Just buy

[0:25:40] epic_smee: One issue is, you cant really get henchmen on all Jobs, because it's nearly always better to work for yourself.
[0:25:41] Zagonja: Julian would prob do sani with you
[0:25:42] gostonko: i have nukes
[0:25:43] legoliket: Lovemore Julian will probably be up for sani
[0:25:48] zemog_01: 4head started working at snr buns which he didnt like so he might be down to do it now

[0:26:45] yodaHn: so basically you're gonna give the randos the twitch split mhm
[0:26:53] ThicccBrickBoi: If not you then someone in the group needs max rep in Sani,g6 ,growing, and so on
[0:26:53] divandesalon: KEKW
[0:27:01] iithum12: Can you not solo dolo sanitation?
[0:27:04] NebelKop: yeah but some people "only" grind and are kinda stuck in that loop
[0:27:13] gostonko: just having a dream dont cut it in this society Smokge
[0:27:15] mortuusintus12: @Eku007 plus 4head cant do anywork now aside from crim stuff and snr buns cause he is a felon
[0:27:21] gostonko: you gotta climb
[0:27:28] NemisizZ: ngl, think a lot of the jobs needs a minimum limit of people to be done, like sanitation, or the bank trucks, it makes no sense someone would drive around with a million dollars in the back of the truck solo
[0:27:31] epic_smee: People saw the Buddha Clip and assume anyone can do what Mr k did lol. Forgetting that he had 10 people grinding for him and funneling money
[0:27:37] NebelKop: true
[0:27:37] NemisizZ: or doing sanitation solo for that matter
[0:27:37] Eku007: mortuusintus12 True mhm
[0:27:40] MercilesssShark: @mortuusintus12 the felony stuff isnt treu
[0:27:43] meego0o: the group also dont feels like a group since everyone does their own
[0:27:48] divandesalon: onlygrind Pog
[0:27:57] gostonko: grindr Pog
[0:28:00] NemisizZ: it just seems more like a mechanic for a public gta server more than its meant for rp
[0:28:04] viniblond: @meego0o i feel the opposite
[0:28:06] MercilesssShark: The felons cant do civ jobs is straight made up
[0:28:07] mortuusintus12: @MercilesssShark lol he literally tried it
[0:28:08] FuddelDuddel: Now is the time to grind instead of speed-running like some crims are doing, since devs are slow-rolling crims developments
[0:28:22] Dogbert: I LOVE GRINDING

[1:58:06] Absolutzer0_v2: Well I need to caveat - I don't think the movie deserved award noms, but in the context of the film, it was really well directed, gerwig at least deserved a nod. But yes - oppenheimer was 100% a superior film
