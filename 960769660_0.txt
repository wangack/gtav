[7:30:01] 631__: the risk tho
[7:30:06] NukesJ: they're still forgetting that the lost is giving 2 free batches on top of the undercutting, so charging 350 per bag is still a garbage deal for speedy

[7:45:58] Schor2: Saab just greedy he saw that 18k from Hayes and now wants more money Kappa
[7:45:59] leightones: @3xevilx yeah, and risking the 9s
[7:46:02] LarryFTW: @volkner4thkage they also get to clean rolls and bands for free though
[7:46:03] KingPresiden: @spidermonkeyjb he's also gotta split it a lot of ways
[7:46:06] SNunez3: dexx is on like 2 times a week sadily
[7:46:08] Hento: Speedy gets first dibs on any batch, but if he passes you can sell to whoever
[7:46:11] jmazz007: the best part is this whole 3 hour convo is all based on speedy accepting their offer
[7:46:13] coldskye: Chat, other works doesn't bring you in game for the 9s.
[7:46:19] SacredAngelCake: speedy is doing more work to sell the product and protecting his rep too, while making meth is a 15 min process per batch.
[7:46:19] axolotli: saab is right cuz they arent getting 50-50 cuz they have to pay for full cook cost uhnHm
[7:46:28] ka1o5: Dealing with P2P also gives leverage to Siz team
[7:46:29] Luthercorpz: I mean long as ur cooking an selling 1 cook a day 5 days a week you're making like 50k a week for 3 cooks each. Not bad for less than a hr of work a day
[7:46:32] hekel: @volkner4thkage, Please.. IT's 50/50... each side gets 50% of the money the meth sells for. That's hwo 50/50 works... Speedy isn't manufacturing the shit, why would he pay the manufacturing cost on top of that. Are you Saab?
[7:46:33] Tuckerbonage: saab definitely wants more money the way he loses it in the casino almost as bad as tony in the casino uhnKek
[7:46:34] MisterTohru: Speedy has no production cost but him and vagos risk being in the streets with meth on them
[7:46:38] rotornaut: is this meth arc even fun for everyone? Send like it's just got everyone mad and stressed...
[7:46:39] juggz_: is more pushers better?
[7:46:41] Bonkins42: the 12k cost offsets how many people Speedy split across
[7:46:41] Princess_Kyloren: @volkner4thkage  but it is 50/50 of revenue NOT profit, why should speedy care what they earn?
[7:46:45] cyanAlpaca: Speedy aint gonna accept spending more money for the cook UNLESS he stands to make a better profit.
[7:46:56] kura1kura: catJAM this music tho
[7:46:58] wendigo172: uhnSuffer Settled out everything with CB, now y’all fight amongst yourselves
[7:47:00] Div_the_Penguin: just keep on cooking whenever lab is up and you should be good
[7:47:04] Dopp: foodKeep
[7:47:10] CherryPy: also, doesnt it technically take speedy longer to sell a batch than you guys to cook it, he has the risk and spends more time no?
[7:47:13] Exe_cuse: Does manny know CB has a warehouse?
[7:47:13] Crit_c: @volkner4thkage Yes, everyone knows that, but a full 50/50 including sharing cost was the original deal, and Speedy doesn't want that anymore. Siz and them knew what Speedy is asking isn't actually 50/50. The issue for them is getting to something that works for both parties.
[7:47:13] MisterTohru: Might want to ask saab if he took out a big loan from the casino recently @uberhaxornova uhnKek uhnKek
[7:47:17] NumbFootToiletTuesday: manny got it

[7:47:28] bubonic2: Wearhouse!  who could afford one of those
[7:47:34] GhostBabyAlien8: they been on the 50/50 split for the past three cooks i dunno why saab suggested it again lmao
[7:47:37] Pisculichiii: A good advantage of having a deal with the vagos is that you secure a spot with your strain so selling to other people would be easier at 400
[7:47:52] NumbFootToiletTuesday: oh i see
[7:47:53] Luthercorpz: Again the Vagos have to spent 20,30 plus hrs a week selling this stuff or more on the street. That's a lot of work lol
[7:47:57] Bonkins42: did Saab just forget everything?
[7:47:57] Tuckerbonage: saab definitely needs to be uhnBan from the casino uhnKek uhnKek
[7:48:03] juggz_: hmm at what purity ?
[7:48:05] volkner4thkage: I get it now but if they say 50/50 to speedy his gonna get confused too and will be thinking his paying for half the cost
[7:48:06] AmberRun: Cheer100

[7:48:07] marvelo: just let Saab do all the talkin Kappa

[7:48:13] GhostBabyAlien8: @juggz_ 82
[7:48:13] shadowfoureight: saab is greed
[7:48:16] Drax_1X: that's like 100k protection money

[7:48:56] SacredAngelCake: Speedy's group takes a few hours to sell a batch of meth plus the risk of getting caught with the meth on them. The Vagos take a huge risk if the cops get involved. While HOA have a much easier time just selling it to the Vagos and making meth that takes 15 to make per batch.

[8:35:47] mlgquikscp420: Ping Pong is super bad - but if he stockpiles like 300 baggies and sells one strain only, this could work
[8:35:48] MisterTohru: 50/50 based on max up front should be the deal siz takes
[8:35:48] EvidentGhost: so he still plans on hitting the ceiling every time he dumps?

[9:19:14] valorant_godlike: Yeah Nino is pushing the lab too hard gona flood the market and fk the meth game for everyone
[9:19:15] arrowlake1g: Vagos x CG X HOA can easily take over CB's lab though NODDERS or push/price them out until nobody wants their product
[9:19:16] Ultimatestrife: ohhh

[9:20:02] itsequ1nox: @arrowlake1g ok, cool. but why?
[9:20:04] Zhinj: @valorant_godlike Since the demand is basically unlimited / but static if that makes sense
[9:20:07] abidyo: @arrowlake1g yea dude, it's kinda sad because I love the CB x Pegasus character so much. but damn dude they're about to get clapped on all sides
[9:20:10] Ardar_: @valorant_godlike they splitting 26k profit with 12 people, what nerf KEKW

[9:22:01] ArJayHeart: as he said
[9:22:11] Plead4yourlife: but what about kraytors connection???
[9:22:16] nokutous: @chryz127 they have their deal secured they don't have much to lose
[9:22:24] MsAutumnWind: a mattress stash would solve so many problems for everyone so of COURSE it doesn't exist
[9:22:27] battlerage623: so what are we doing rn chat?
[9:22:31] Luthercorpz: There is no way to store money really an actually sell drugs etc LUL
