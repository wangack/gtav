[6:31:34] Lethalized86: Jaywalking fine should go to the person who manages to hit them. Make being a pedestrian interesting

[6:32:04] PepperAnn131: @outlawpickle Who knows when exactly it spawns. Maybe where you got hit; maybe where you landed. In the latter case, you could get hit on the sidewalk but then get flung onto the road.
[6:32:05] duffrose1980: thanks for the strimms, Curvey!

[6:33:42] BlinkingBat_: Clem curvyeHi
[6:33:59] PepperAnn131: Line up some criminals from sidewalk to the middle of the road and then run them over with a car, one by one. Nice idea, Thallo_Auxo
[6:38:00] fambaa: @PepperAnn131 well they said the "victims" arrived later and hit the others, so idk maybe they wanted to steal bags and rammed their truck, it was very strange on the sidewalk and not parked
[6:43:15] fambaa: is 3 different DNA so one of those must be the person who got hit by the truck if the story is true Hmmmm
