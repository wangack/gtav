While Auto-Tune was designed to be used subtly to correct vocal performances, the ‚ÄúBelieve‚Äù producers used extreme settings to create unnaturally rapid corrections in Cher‚Äôs vocals, thereby removing portamento, the natural slide between pitches in singing.

[7:45:16] topmiddle: he nervous i guess
[7:45:16] azurevein: bro clay is uber scared
[7:45:17] gruegd: Clays logic only makes sense if he is purposely targetting someone from cg.
[7:45:17] ironbullman: Is he assuming everyone as cg or he knws its them?
[7:45:27] catquickspider: in the end the plan is that there is no plan

[7:46:12] realJokoWidodo: @midzito oh thanks for the info man
[7:46:15] khanoute: Clay's logic doesn't make much sense under close scrutiny, it means he wouldn't shoot anyone shooting them in the fear that they COULD be CG
