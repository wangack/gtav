[0:17:46] mokoto05: yap gonna get that money up first neutrenSteer
[0:17:48] versayanaa: It feels too early for S class cars tbh

[0:20:16] iLLuSi0NN: If u want expensive car u should be able to afford repairs too
[0:20:22] Mixcy9: They are going to stay like that from what Koil said
[0:20:22] l_Scant_l: on the flip side, car prices might rocket
[0:20:26] renimation: they are just gonna drive cheaper cars
[0:20:27] Fugeki: are you going to flip cars this reset I feel like you have are so ahead when it comes to car purchases
[0:20:31] Mixcy9: He want people to drive a daily
[0:20:49] mimmakata: neutrenWait
[0:20:51] Neon099: MAybe the thinking of Lang who he said with the mechanic shop is something
[0:20:54] Mixcy9: And if you want a race car sure but you gonna have to sink money in it
[0:21:35] BogdanCaba: Prices might be OK. Mechanics skills may be the ones that reduce repair costs by repairing 20%-30% with one part.
[0:21:38] Auruanix: i like the feel of super cars being rare, like when you see them on the streets you know something is up
[0:21:47] sarahm9889: We will see what happens
[0:22:08] emertista: if people can have access to money prices go only up, thats economy
[0:22:11] versayanaa: I feel like the progression in cars is missing in 4.0. Tuner cars came way later in 3.0

[2:01:33] Iwin124: toggle f8 on and off to see where mouse pointer is, then move mouse when f8 is closed, repeat untill you hit, maybe this works if the problem is invisible mouse pointer
[2:01:37] MintRiver11: @arthur2jz the tablet scuffed and he can't click anything on it and its hard to close it back
[2:01:41] SiImeria_: were u able to fix it atleast once b4?

[3:23:06] yattyz: No asset fees?
[3:23:10] error_code5: he has them just the price to fix them is supposedly expensive @zthrones
[3:23:14] Firepokachu: what do you think about lang asking for a mechanic shop
[3:23:17] klaunns: they did start racing thing, blacklist
[3:23:29] Evo_Me: @klaunns rolling with da boiz
[3:23:35] zThrones: @error_code5 ohhh okay okay ty
[3:23:45] OmegamonX: is there a website for racing stats agains like last time or is it not established yet?
[3:23:50] Evo_Me: Lol how much are repairs
[3:24:33] error_code5: we don’t fully know yet but rumors are like $100 for 1 minute of driving @evo_me
[3:24:51] Evo_Me: Damn
[3:25:00] Vill_Co: aren’t you carrying 1?
[3:25:05] Shad0w_wizard: I wonder what the packer looks like
[3:25:24] itzkyol: do you drive with a controller or keyboard and mouse?
[3:25:31] ketsu93: I wonder if asset fees are gonna even be a thing? Maybe just use = pay, electricity bill for house, expensive repairs for cars
[3:25:54] 3_A_B_C: server longevity
[3:26:01] shadow__fx: lacks would make people lazy
[3:26:08] yattyz: Having everything is bad for longevity
[3:26:23] Shad0w_wizard: facts ^
[3:26:37] Auruanix: they were lax in 3.0 and then the economy exploded
[3:26:44] yattyz: having stuff to grind for / reach is good for longevity but not too grindy
[3:26:45] Evo_Me: I like the way they are doing it, things mean more
[3:26:46] mimmakata: Next server is probably gta6 based
[3:26:59] error_code5: gotta come in late to do the interesting stuff but then your super behind everyone
[3:27:25] Firepokachu: doesn’t it show weight?
[3:28:17] ketsu93: seems like they went for expensive to use rather than expensive to buy Hmmm
[3:28:23] Shad0w_wizard: yea about a month nodd
[3:28:34] Firepokachu: yeah car prices are interesting
[3:28:42] ozokar: maybe its easy to loose cars when doing crime in them
[3:28:44] Auruanix: that shows how much inflated the prices in 3.0 were
[3:28:49] Firepokachu: wonder how much that comet will be worth in 2 months
[3:28:51] OmegamonX: now is the time where ROI actually can be seen
[3:28:51] josh_mccammon: 1 month 3 days
[3:29:15] mimmakata: Maybe you will lose your assets easier in this server than 3.0 if you do crime
[3:29:36] Auruanix: you made like 150k+ in a month
[3:29:46] Vill_Co: well I was about to say people like yuno were so confused as to how yall could buy so much. yall grind a good bit more than some others
[3:30:22] ju_von: damn bro
[3:30:44] WentToBuyMilkAgain: What do you think about opening a repair shop, would it be worth it?
[3:31:15] jal10000000: you can see how much you earned in total from the grime tablet app under personal i think
[3:31:29] Auruanix: ^
[3:32:12] WentToBuyMilkAgain: I was surprised you and tony didn't open a repair shop
[3:32:18] Firepokachu: it would be sick for potential tuning down the line
[3:32:30] dr4c0_27: Means in 8 runs u make avg 2.5 k which is 20 k and a repair 1.5 k minus to 18.5 k @neutren
[3:32:46] boffe945: I feel like u could be a sick leader of a repair/tuning shop tho
[3:33:37] Shad0w_wizard: hell yea!
[3:33:42] Shad0w_wizard: I like that nodd
[3:33:43] argonize: tunings not in yet though right
[3:33:50] Auruanix: that would be perfect
[3:33:52] dr4c0_27: U can charge people by tuning their cars ezzz
[3:34:01] JUVN: i feel like goofy name will bring the race community to the shop atleast
[3:34:06] 3_A_B_C: koil said there would be a ton of stuff
[3:34:25] bruHoran: ride height, suspension rebound, etc nodd
[3:34:38] turr16xd: Power curves be like, higher on high rpms= best power line pretty much my exp from forza
[3:34:50] Skimma6: you shouldve seen harry messing with his garbage truck last night KEKW
[3:34:57] rabal_: i feels like mechic shop for you and tony means that there will be things you will need/want from and buddha tries to push this ic somehow
[3:35:09] dizzledaz: Jean Paul and Ray would def want their cars to just go 200+ on a straight and not care about anything else LUL
[3:35:21] argonize: gonna be a while before all that stuff goes live though
[3:35:21] shadow__fx: the tuning the cars will be fun to see what people do. Feel like people will do a power build like nalak
[3:35:26] Hentai__Dad: being able to repair racers before the races is huge $$$
[3:35:35] nate921269: lol u already no what u can do lol it’s just a matter of when u can lol lang said u and tony were testers
[3:35:44] boffe945: Tony and octos tuneshop I can already see it
[3:35:57] magunbp: Make the cop cars go 40
[3:36:03] Firepokachu: would be interesting since it could also lead into being tony and octos branch in the family
[3:36:09] WentToBuyMilkAgain: Can you tune cop cars
[3:36:19] livemico7: bro getting that money up everyday nice
[3:36:26] Shad0w_wizard: @Hentai__Dad nodd

[3:39:49] xdannyx98: right right KEK
[3:39:53] anglo115: I mean at the end of the day, we all do things we don't enjoy
[3:39:54] TrueWano: that’s true but when everyone gonna have cars and racing he’s not gonna have one which I think he gonna hate he didn’t grind harder
[3:39:57] CaptScary: Yeah but that blows up any economy you want to have

[3:40:51] shadow__fx: But that will make some people brats and always looking for hand outs and the people that need to work for it will hate them
[3:40:54] Auruanix: mayor is supposed to do that with state funds right?
[3:41:05] SiImeria_: he has recruited literally everyone other than the dons (excluding luci)
