[0:15:38] Br0ckthe_r0ck: same
[0:15:40] Rebel_Tech: There is a way to split screen and play Magic with friends but you play with your actual decks, and it has tools to help see what cards are and stuff. It is fun if you have a group but are at long distance.
[0:15:43] Liquid_In_Silico: Same

[0:16:23] OnlineDatabase: I've still got all of my MTG cards from the late 90s, loved playing that shit
[0:16:31] gvwolf: I just couldnt get into magic the gathering and gave them away
[0:16:31] Rebel_Tech: Draft tournaments at the LGS for Magic are so much fun, throw $15-20 and draft a deck from booster packs then play to win.

[0:16:41] carcool12: the only pc card games I like are games like inscription where its story, but THEY MADE A PHYSICAL CARD GAME

[0:17:16] Battleliquor: arena was my 1st introduction into how to play and i thought it did a good job teaching
[0:17:16] Brachwurst: used to play MTG. Nothing feels as good as opening packs of cards IRL. The feel the smell. zeldas9Poggies I’ve been sober from it since 2014ish
[0:17:30] Gwnquinten: yugioh is so one sided, if you get the first turn you just win

[0:17:41] GizmoMCs: Keepo
[0:17:44] Animefan232: @Gwnquinten nope second turn
[0:17:47] Idsertian: I like me some occasional MTG, but the DoTP games were rigged af with cheating AI, and the F2P game is rigged to fuck to make you buy cards by deliberately tanking your win rate by matching you against players that will just fuck you up.
[0:17:56] Rebel_Tech: I have a group of friends and we play Magic on table top sim, build decks on scryfall for free, but we set limits on the decks. Like under certain $, ban certain cards, or say you have to play with only cards you actually own. That way our long distance group can still play weekly.
[0:17:57] Animefan232: @Animefan232 second turn draws 1st turn does not

[5:18:08] Gwnquinten: didnt roach say you can lock the storage?
[5:18:09] B1n4ryGaming: buy a car and stow
[5:18:09] AtlasSubstitute: i believe every interactable thing has l0gs
[5:18:11] wordlife97: @SilentSentry what if u were to get robbed and they took ur key
[5:18:14] AtlasSubstitute: and they can check it
[5:18:15] sunfire1202: penta did house robberies earlier idk if that means player owned or local or both
[5:18:22] Kiddersteve: they can see who accessed the box
[5:18:26] GudderSnipe: it hasn't happened thus far for anyone,
[5:18:37] imSammers: @SilentSentry im gonna be honest, if some shit happens like that, the admins can and definitely will sort that shit out
[5:18:39] lockedheart7: room storage looked bigger, guess that's the biggest advantage
[5:18:41] AtlasSubstitute: anything u can interact with has lgs
[5:18:44] AtlasSubstitute: l0gs
[5:18:46] Grafhicks: buy a chap carry and valet it
[5:18:48] bobatr0nix: Anyone who has a key can search your storage. And Roach forgets how many people he rents rooms to. So id say only store stuff your ok with losing
[5:18:51] Gwnquinten: i thought there was a lock on the box itself?
[5:18:51] vynfu: admins are also constantly invis going around checking people
[5:18:52] Huso833: They can at least look into it but I haven't seen too many like "house robberies"
[5:18:58] Grafhicks: cheap car and valet it
[5:19:02] Ellethwen_: nothin really to steal on onx yet
[5:19:06] BoozeMarlin: be nice if they had to pick the storage lock
[5:19:23] imSammers: @vynfu they also have logs for literally everything

[5:19:40] dripydryp: @imsammers are house robberies in yetv?
[5:19:42] toratora_TT: legit
[5:19:44] Kiddersteve: Roach can revoke the key access, but that need him to be awake
[5:19:44] ItsMeMattK: Forced homelessness prank!
[5:19:50] chaosandlead: call the mob :) to hire a hitman :P
[5:19:52] lockedheart7: and what if you want to move and Roach never returns? Are you stuck with paying $400 a week forever?
[5:19:55] kleevedge: It gives them a chance to create rp for their risk
[5:20:06] imSammers: @dripydryp funny you ask, it actually just got introduced today lol
[5:20:10] Kiddersteve: I would say the room is 70% safe
[5:20:11] Huso833: Think pocket wiping is against the rules too

[5:23:31] kleevedge: @dripydryp your neighbors should know whose house that is and if they like you they help protect you. Its like gang turf almost
[5:23:36] imSammers: @SilentSentry pocket wiping is really fucked - i've seen it happen but it is extremely rare and seems frowned upon here
[5:23:40] haywood_jablaumee: can you get a safe deposit box?
