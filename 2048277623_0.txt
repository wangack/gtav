[12:44:33] fambaa: I feel like fence is the first you get stolen goods from next is probably robberies of some sort
[12:44:54] ishouldprobably: obviously gotta Indiana Jones that shit with a deer head
[12:45:08] guygavin: does Tony know about these runs?
[12:45:16] Dark_Eyes32: the goods were in the trunk though so where would the new goods be if you’re trying to get back on the job

[12:46:35] sirpercidal: are you going to try and finish this run?
[12:46:41] sirpercidal: if so you’ll need more
[12:46:45] redemption2094: Let's find out
[12:46:51] smojo: What did we do with the old stolen goods from the 1st run?
[12:46:54] sirpercidal: copium
[12:47:09] Eku007: Maney is main gain probably
[12:47:16] Eku007: MoneyUp

[12:48:05] lyfmobile: thats like 40-45 min of weed selling in turf
[12:48:09] fambaa: I do have the suspicion that the fence might eventually sell tools or something thats needed to do higher tier illegal stuff, it would make sense
[12:48:25] redemption2094: Let's talk that into reality chat Kappa
[12:48:26] buraotlegend: still beefing with company??

[12:48:34] apache78: And it's kinda low stakes in terms of cops
[12:48:37] ishouldprobably: it's gotta lead somewhere. I refuse to believe they created the sewers to just plop a fence npc down there
[12:48:46] pnwgreg: Yeah fence in most games is buy and sell so that'd be sick if you could buy stuff from him
[12:48:47] ryuudrg: finally tony getting that fence rep when he hears that you drive fast cars KEKW
[12:49:02] difficultsleep3r: I got a bad feeling about this run.
[12:49:02] fambaa: also remember that contact near the apartments maybe he has something new
[12:49:26] IGotItFromMyMam4: it sais too far away
[12:49:28] unIuko: can you have somebody else just do it

[12:51:06] Palizangetsu: or maybe the rep isn't implemented yet
[12:51:07] BlacKnight2514: ohh
[12:51:11] tz223: it did say "if you don't complete this I'll be upset" which kind of implies it should
[12:51:14] Eku007: @redemption2094 Yeah it has charge icon instead of fuel
[12:51:17] BlacKnight2514: prob scuffed maybe
[12:51:25] popa_jr: i wonder how much you can make an hour doing this

[13:34:40] Akizakiz: with how u only need 7 to start job
[13:34:45] RagingSantas: @Akizakiz there's a massive process to get the money from crim side, for g6 they just hand it in
[13:34:46] redemption2094: @chefchad1 I saw someone watching the clip so I don't have it. But you if I'm not mistaken a guy just dress up exactly as them and preding to help when transfering from trucks and just run away..
[13:35:11] Palizangetsu: @Akizakiz no civs should be making more money right now eventually crims are going to be making a lot
[13:35:32] Eku007: 3 parts = Run is so good
[13:35:37] sethabi: 35x4 = 140 so a bit more than the rolls before
[13:35:41] EnzikFires: G6 are moving someone elses money and get paid accordingly. this is stealing all the money and giving a kickback
