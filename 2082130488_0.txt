There's a rule about government employees following traffic laws, PD breaks that all the time by flashing lights whne they aren't on a call. Typically the only rules people get in trouble for are exploits/powergaming and metagaming

[5:01:35] tonysweg1: looks fun
[5:01:36] shin5sato3: POWER GAMiNG arnoldHalt not using first person view
[5:01:36] agnosticbishops: this isn't the Cornwood way

[5:01:37] cuphandss: its nt
[5:01:38] Bill_Collector: @esfandtv Pay goofy for driving lessons
[5:01:38] LHaxorP: i think bones drives that way because the road becomes somewhat "fixed" so maybe better from a pure chase perspective
[5:01:39] permacool: youre legit driving better too @EsfandTV
[5:01:39] geckoguy69: Much easier to watch
[5:01:39] Redtwintails: gibe it a try

[5:01:40] HaZeJgg: you cant peak around corners like that

[5:01:46] Toastbane: Try high cam without touching mouse?
[5:01:47] Asura_Shini: The other camera view probably has you looking at unimportant things tbh which causes you to get minor distrctions during a chase
[5:01:47] RiotsOfMyLife: do what you want tbh
[5:01:47] davideil: You dont have to not move it at all, it's just the way you move it most of the times

[6:34:28] wellhungfish: Was that k?
[6:34:28] antreids: I mean you tried but he just ran off. Priority says stay on the scene
[6:34:29] CopperKat: Chat it's supposed to be a city of like 2 million people. Cops can't act like they know everyone.
[6:34:30] dapyman: Yup
[6:34:32] ben_v_art: K was masked, so basically till you get an ID can't know who it is.
[6:34:32] csgoloser21: told to detain like 5 times doesnt detain lul
[6:34:32] tbowfoshow: @DatDudeJakeC what favoritism? He was going to detain him and he took off. He also doesn't know its K

[6:36:25] halos420: detainment doesnt mean cuffs chat, if he is still there, he is technically detained

[10:16:06] taraannee: @Usahi_Light tbh i rlly dont get a lot of the rules they make, seems like theyre making it hard to a lot of groups to prosper
[10:16:06] superbizarr0: agreed but someone must have thought it was amazing

[10:16:20] SereneDreams: @the_main_burt If I played a PD character I'd 100% have a cheat sheet with all the codes on it and check it like "wtf did they just say?" often, I'm sure

[10:54:27] xSlinko: The culture to this new PD feels amazing

[10:54:36] smithers0351: FirstTimeChatter
[10:54:40] Toastedgamer03: i think it is call you need to pay but marking for tow is just like a local job for them
[10:54:40] slomojosh: Shift 3ers have the same cadence when they speak
[10:54:42] BigSeth: no academy
[10:54:46] smithers0351: slayyy radio check
[10:54:51] droksid00: Morale >>
[10:54:51] HeyMeghan: no bc yall call them instead of submitting the request which then gets sent to them as a job to accept like the moseleys jobs work
[10:54:51] warner05: Objection weird
[10:54:53] mad0monk: You ever watch that repo show? I feel like someone should reinact it for GTA and just start showing up to tow random cars
[10:54:54] Kiyoni: @BlanketWang Yeah shift 2 and 3 are similar in terms of personalities
[10:54:57] SpaceCowboy94: Lol
[10:54:57] PrettyKrazy: @BigSeth YEP FeelsStrongMan Clap
[10:54:57] Kaelath_The_Red: @IanDooleyTV only if we're on duty and get the job 3.0 used to pay just picking them up not 4.0
[10:54:58] ltl_wackman: @HefHeresy yesterday fundraising was good and they seem happy today
[10:54:59] HefHeresy: I imagine him calling people out for not funding the PD themselves probably made a culture shift too.
[10:55:05] wetwettt: is this a cornwood specific cop vehicle? like he owns it?
[10:55:12] PrettyKrazy: yea..
[10:55:13] ltl_wackman: yea that makes sense

[10:55:38] Vertigo_GG: Slacks needs to drop to FTO or something so he can have fun
[10:55:39] KurenYo: true
[10:55:41] BigSeth: slacks was tunnel visioning from all the work
[10:55:45] ltl_wackman: ssaab himself gets off at a decent hour these days which is admirable af too
[10:55:46] smithers0351: filled the gap
[10:55:46] droksid00: By proxy. Because you also would talk to the captains
[10:55:47] slatt5: the contrast from a month or so ago to now is very very different & the vibes are especially positive today
[10:55:52] Toastedgamer03: cornwood is the big emotional support teddy bear NODDERS
[10:55:53] Auhreliam: HaaAAApening
[10:55:54] inducedcatharsis: And then they DAP'd him to shit and he had to leave LULW
[10:56:00] ltl_wackman: yea like a scapegoat
[10:56:00] Smapdi_Flaffermann: He talked to people plenty.  He just ignored them and then accused them of disrespect when they got sick of it.
[10:56:01] PrettyKrazy: tfw youre overloaded trying to survive work Pain
[10:56:03] Oatmealyeti_: honestly spot on
[10:56:03] Wiipotato: Ruth MVP

[10:56:13] TimmayHS: the same thing is happening to Xavier with the Judges it seems like
[10:56:14] slatt5: they tried to make cornwood the problem child
[10:56:15] MarvinOGravel: He is definitely a gossip girl, tho
[10:56:15] alexskater5027: they tried to paint him as malicious
[10:56:16] PappaMidNight: was saturneighteen a cop in 3.0?
[10:56:16] klappah: tried to make him out to be a troublemaker when he was just relaying
[10:56:25] slomojosh: CORNWOOD WAS LITERALLY TONY ROMO
[10:56:25] GGTurner30: CORNMAN CORNMAN
[10:56:27] Connorbrow: @vertigo_gg FTO is a cert not a rank. Slacks has been FTOing this whole time
[10:56:29] christianpenab: very biased
[10:56:32] ltl_wackman: everyone is so mad and its cornwood's fault! (but its not)
[10:56:32] CookiesOnDowels: "undermining the chain of command" was such BS
[10:56:33] layla109: Ruth actually saved the PD. The master planner!
[10:56:34] ihhunt3r: @slomojosh LULW
[10:56:36] SpaceCowboy94: I wanna lock slacks in a closet
[10:56:36] smithers0351: cornwood wasn't a pot stirrer
[10:56:38] taraannee: ppl still went to slacks, slacks was just busy 24/7 working shift 2&3 to cover turners loa that he couldnt get much done himself
[10:56:38] amavadin: Let me tell you how it will be There's one for you, nineteen for me  'Cause I'm the Slacksman  Yeah, I'm the Slacksman
[10:56:38] TimmayHS: Slacks and the captains are the real doomspiralers... and Nekoda
[10:56:38] HefHeresy: Calling out problems is better than not fixing them and pretending everything is dandy.
[10:56:41] superbizarr0: NODDERS  Cornwoods a "whitehat"
[10:56:43] coldan01: ruth messed with the wrong officer
[10:56:44] RietArtwork: Cornwood is a lot less stressed now too, fewer people need to go to him, which is good

[10:57:02] droksid00: @cookiesondowels literally covering up for leadership failings
[10:57:04] TheSwizzzz: @PappaMidNight She had two cops Cleo shaw and juno sweeney
[10:57:04] iwannanuhh: The result of standing up to your superiors for your peers that wont. you take all the flack
[10:57:04] knuuuunt: because people get weird under any positions of power
[10:57:06] TheSoldier1851: You played that arc really well though

[10:57:08] knuuuunt: power hungry mfs
[10:57:09] nickcannonsjokewriter: Is it just me or is Esfand identifying with cornood too much?
[10:57:10] IllusiOGnarly: no drama other than lil jokes
[10:57:13] d36i: did you get the chance to talk to knight and aziz yet?
[10:57:16] Chawizaud: @TCGK_SUBZERO a dark knight
[10:57:19] happysquidy69: captain chatters r present KEKL
[10:57:21] IllusiOGnarly: true
[10:57:22] EmDuBB13: i think the first guy that said Classic was quoting slacks
[10:57:22] superbizarr0: NODDERS  Cornwoods a paladin to put it in fantasy terms
[10:57:23] KhrisOsaurus: Kappa
[10:57:27] KurenYo: did cornwood tell slacks about his last dap situation?
[10:57:27] Eypnos: LUL
[10:57:27] Trepko: I think the captains just lacked alot of leadership skills.
[10:57:28] Dirtysandwitch: Others take advantage of Cornwood's good nature.
[10:57:28] Reuschel: I'm also an ass man
[10:57:29] dogmaster9000: im a man im 40
[10:57:30] XtremeVanman: W

[10:58:07] HefHeresy: Makes sense
[10:58:10] PappaMidNight: @TheSwizzzz ohh i forgot juno was a ranger or something. That blows my mind from what ive seen of her on moons stream
[10:58:12] MadderHatter: your power and people that all liked you were a threat to their power for sure
[10:58:12] Mystikalrush: Cornwood is a genuine honest terrorist
[10:58:14] Smapdi_Flaffermann: Tarotism?
[10:58:18] amavadin: Smadge
[10:58:21] DieterK: HDMI
[10:58:28] iwannanuhh: being the only outspoken person will always put a target on your back, especially if your criticizing leadership

[10:58:34] PhantomPlayin: hey
[10:58:39] EmDuBB13: everyone let you take the fall and wouldnt speak up accept behind the scenes
[10:58:42] thestolentimes: But Ruth's was
[10:58:42] ColbaeTV: sniffthenewchatter
[10:58:44] LogicWeasel: True, that was only Ruth and shift 1 minions who wanted that power
[10:58:44] Mystikalrush: Duncaning Duncaning Duncaning
[10:58:46] ltl_wackman: @PappaMidNight also juno is being fazed out bc saturn has some irl commitments upcoming according to diva
[10:58:48] JustSomeAsianGuyWithADog: bomb a hospital Pog

[10:58:57] slomojosh: Vienna sausages
[10:58:59] PrettyKrazy: Stare
[10:59:00] TheSwizzzz: @PappaMidNight What di yiu mean is she not doing a good job?>
[10:59:00] Usahi_Light: Slacks' RP is just better imo when he's not in a position of power over someone, the dialogue is way more natural
[10:59:01] SypherBA: cordwood spends 80% of 15hr in Mission row
[10:59:01] Top5Lels: slacks is like you in where he just wants things to work and wants whats best for the pod
[10:59:02] bluehashbrowns: sniffthenewchatter
[10:59:03] Top5Lels: pd*
[10:59:06] cocokitty: esfandCozy
[10:59:07] layla109: Slacks is not power hungry at all. He's just a workaholic and people go to him for things just liek cornwood.
[10:59:09] Jrey000: Ruth 100% is that type of character that does not want to give up power and delagete
[10:59:11] neinchooch: the reports thing in the past is only valid cornwood criticism I agree with
[10:59:13] callmefive: be on guard for retaliation
[10:59:16] warner05: @slomojosh you're making me hungry
[10:59:18] Mystikalrush: Cornwood is the joker from The Dark Knight
[10:59:18] droksid00: It was only an issue because it was having OOC repercussions and I'm not sure everyone saw that. Esfand saw it early and tried to address it via Cornwood.
[10:59:19] icrlym: seems like everybody finds Cornwood extremely approachable, and feel heard when they talk to him
[10:59:20] MadderHatter: you keep defending slacks when he almost got you trumped up on murder charges
[10:59:21] PrettyKrazy: essaying
[10:59:22] Sillyanne: sillya1Jam
[10:59:22] Blizzard5050: Slacks just wants to SBS at this point LUL
[10:59:28] d36i: i dont even think ruth was intented to be that type of character, she was just meant to e ultra stern and mean which cheever had a hard time with, turned out for great RP though
[10:59:29] ltl_wackman: RareEsfand
[10:59:32] eonsteams: stephleeRagingbear TehePelo
[10:59:33] cocokitty: i‚Äôm having a snickers bar
[10:59:34] iwannanuhh: im just ready for pd drama to end tbh, that whole arc was good but exhausting
[10:59:36] phaden_: It does seem like the PD is able to have more fun now. But everything happening before was so good
[10:59:41] thestolentimes: Tip to help your neck, sleep without a pillow. It has helped my bad neck a lot.
[10:59:42] justinfieldsqb1: talk to Johnson
[10:59:43] happysquidy69: seeing slacks on duty and being able to say "lmao not my issue go ask the chief" has been so fun
[10:59:44] TCGK_SUBZERO: WideHardo LACK OF EMOTES

[11:00:05] ihhunt3r: PD is secured HandsUp
[11:00:11] droksid00: @madderhatter honestly great RP. Two friends both feeling justified in what they're doing. Both feeling betrayed.
[11:00:11] icrlym: Cornwood doesn‚Äôt just hear their problems and blow them off. He has discussion with them about it and that goes along way for people.
[11:00:11] jazzmaggot: yarrBongos PogChamp
[11:00:13] LogicWeasel: Lenny

[11:00:15] warner05: Alice
[11:00:17] hawkeye69r: i think the issue was 3 separate but equal captains. It lead to captains having to defend ideas they didnt hold
[11:00:18] PappaMidNight: @ltl_wackman Roger that, hopefully its not bad news
[11:00:18] BlakeChaos: I bet your lawyer buddies miss you, they were having a good time hanging with ya

[11:12:42] HefHeresy: @TopicTech If you give up your info to people, you're bound to have snitches. The crim Rp is also hunting those down.
[11:12:44] droksid00: @bigoldmanmeat did lovesick get back
[11:12:48] TopicTech: @SkywalkerCush they come to PD and just give all the data to PD for not RP reason, no money, no wager, nothing
[11:12:50] Usahi_Light: @SkywalkerCush It's just too easy to learn a crim mechani and go straight to cops and spill it. it hurts crim RP and I'd argue it hurts cop RP too because there's no need for investigation
[11:12:53] adch03: What happened with that Tessa situation the other day @chat?

[11:13:17] bigoldmanmeat: @droksid00 nah hes still out, he said later maybe in a few months, which isnt really giving beric a chance to make his changes imo
[11:13:18] MAXATAK: they already knew it all, so it doesn't really matter at all anyway, TopicTech
[11:13:18] PrettyKrazy: @TopicTech thats what you see

[11:13:50] b1gtrent: L snitch
[11:14:01] SkywalkerCush: @Usahi_Light it was for RP reasons though? The guy wants to be a part of the PD and is doing his own investigations
[11:14:05] Usahi_Light: @xxlonegunmanxx They do investigation typically to learn mechanics instead of civs just walkling up and explaining it all. PD has to learn crim mechanics a different way than crims typically but just dumping it prevents that
[11:14:13] bigoldmanmeat: @droksid00 yeah losing lovesick is rough he was a good one, especially for shift 1
[11:14:15] Usahi_Light: yeah in this scenario you already knew, it just sucks they attempted to do it

[11:14:49] Usahi_Light: @EmDuBB13 "hey look what this guy told me" RP vs investigations by PD, stakeouts, chases, interrogation, etc isnt even comparable

[12:40:44] layla109: @illuminat4242 When u think about it, Ruth and by extension Mr K (johnson incident) lead the events going forward towards PD having an Mayor to poke around in PD, the audit and appointing a Chief. Ruth was great for RP and I'll give them their flowers for that. No many can be the villain for the greater good. (I'm half joking when I say Ruth was good for PD IC wise)

[13:46:35] ZachFromChat: very slight camber will help cornering, excessive camber will make you break traction easier
[13:46:38] Aphotice: in the end it depends on if the adjustments actually respond the way you would think they would
[13:46:38] thestolentimes: @EsfandTV Cambering makes it so your tires don't overheat on turns

[15:17:34] nathund: there was like a blob that looked like it went right, it tricked me when I rewatched it too
[15:17:38] cadGG: cadGG subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 55 months! worst part about rp chat isn't meta or chat hopping, it's not being able to spam the WideHardo in emote only mode sajjbutluvv
[15:17:41] Kaseyfullofjoy: @weaboocowboy  I think condtant vocal fry might actually be good for vocal chords to be fair
[15:17:41] dwakndwa: He drove straight, just lagged as he turned right and then went straight
[15:17:43] darkgnome77: I watched that clip and from what I can tell he went straight and potentially due to the fog he made a turn after he got far enough away and that is what threw everyone off
[15:17:54] Sillyanne: @kaycastv ahh
[15:17:58] PoisonDart11: i see, cuz ur camera movement u missed him going straight
[15:17:59] HenryChase: let flop drive

[15:18:15] BakedBeandon: shrujj
[15:18:15] McNuggetyo: he went straight 100%
[15:18:18] Selfowned: @EsfandTV i think they went on the stairs between the street and tbe building
[15:18:18] SupportYourLocalLurker: looks like he just loses control and that makes it look like he turns right.
[15:18:19] Sniffle04: looked fine to me, just moved right a bit to avoid something and kept going straight
[15:18:20] sisko243: WideYump

[15:18:33] Thaddeos: chat blind went obvious straight
[15:18:34] Daxius121: When his car angled down from the road he kinda disappeared in the fog and sent it straight.
[15:18:34] nathund: there was also 100% a blob that looked like it went right too though
[15:18:36] Janman88: he like NOS'd yeah LUl
[15:18:37] SoLDiER510: He had to have nitrous theres no way HahaReindeer
[15:18:37] liveleak_playz: all the right turn gamers quiet now haha
[15:18:42] darkgnome77: It looked like he went right but pretty sure he went straight and after that he potentially made a turn and it was hard to see since he was under the underpass and it was foggy
[15:18:42] drrmop: not sure how that glendale got that fast
[15:18:43] Wolfstar_Builds: @ThisIsCookedMyBoy blatantly right, you might need some sleep

[15:18:49] Janizki_Fin: No he a 100% just blasted straight.
[15:18:51] Dumboodaking: the road naturally bended to the right so you lost visual for a second but you could see him straight before you look right
[15:18:53] volv88: what's with that manner in the voice there lol
[15:18:54] mandelblot: cops following too far back to see through fog
[15:18:57] IllusiOGnarly: ive seen it 5 times now its not visible cause you kinda like krazy ivan when that guy ran out in the street and you lose visibility
[15:18:59] ThisIsCookedMyBoy: @Wolfstar_Builds ok bud
[15:18:59] TheRealStanchez: They went onto the sidewalk and down to the lower level in front of the building
