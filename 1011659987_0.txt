[3:41:41] cassdoodles: all judges do things different
[3:41:42] KeefBall: i think if they have notes on them you can get the charge
[3:41:42] Goldfish_Vendor: buying drugs should be its own charge NODDERS
[3:41:43] 3spada_Grande: could you follow them back to a property
[3:41:43] adamiskeyed: investigating oxy runs when you know drugs are involved and dirty money but what avenue as a cop can you do with it lol
[3:41:44] hershy_g: I guess receiving is not selling.
[3:41:44] tastysteambuns: Why even have the charge if the whole mechanic of oxy is dumb

[3:41:51] BolbiBaggins: It’s a bartering of drugs KEKW
[3:41:52] Tuk3s: sale of drugs used to include the sale and receiving a drugs before, not sure how it's worded now
[3:41:52] morghoull: would it be trafficking them? peepoSus
[3:41:53] pr4vus: it's silly because it's a mechanics argument, like that charge is clearly meant for that situation
[3:41:55] DieselPoweredWankle: Drug trafficking
[3:41:55] widdafresh7: Probably depends on the judge. Also might be more expected for meth or p2p sale of oxy
[3:41:56] LolmanScott: @AnyaFlux same I thought "sale" was either buying or selling
[3:41:57] Anonymousv8: baas had the same issue
[3:41:57] ThatOneJak: Drug trafficking I think it would be a because like you're doing a hand off to get supply so that you could sell that supply it's like a it's like a it's a cycle kind of thing so I think it would be more like drug trafficking no matter what the item is in the box
[3:41:58] rentalsocks: is there like a charge for buying drugs
[3:41:59] ArJayHeart: Its a good question to ask, usually they note it that he was found  guilty in bench trial
[3:41:59] Forser: I would bring it up with higher ranked officers so they can start pushing it
[3:42:00] Hardcastle1971: drug sniffing dog... maybe
[3:42:01] Pepsiguy2009: udercover drug sale with a recording device KEKLEO

[3:42:05] SloppyNevan: is there a purchasing charge?

[3:42:10] freddytoo123: they get some bills for "selling" the packages, pretty sure. bills and oxy
[3:42:11] Hento: City is literally broken, they cant say what is in the box, devs have to make a way to open it
[3:42:11] AnyaFlux: @UberHaxorNova i really thought Sale of Drugs counted on either end of the sale
[3:42:13] Studkip: maybe you gotta pretend to be a local and try to buy from them
[3:42:14] slayer1833: Trafficking seems reasonable
[3:42:15] AvWorgen: Is there a possession with intent to sell?
[3:42:15] JustCuzii: First bench trial was a W
[3:42:19] Thomarse: I forget, did you ever test the oxy boxes at meth spots? @UberHaxorNova
[3:42:22] cellojakers: They have to use oxy somehow right
[3:42:28] ripAXL: Couldn’t you say the box contains a high amount of drugs, but the buyer only wanted to buy a portion of it. That’s where the notes come in?????
[3:42:28] reMdan: @UberHaxorNova can you read "sae of Drug" charge?

[3:42:41] thatcatarthur: Is there a charge other than the sale of narcotics that might fit better?
[3:42:42] mnk_tropic: its probably stolen goods, like how one guy buys them from you, then you drop them off in packages and get paid in oxy.
[3:42:46] rossbrian82: PWID

[3:46:12] CliffZ28: @leightones KEKW
[3:46:13] adamiskeyed: technically i dont think its really drug sales
[3:46:14] Buzzabeel: @alexruiz__ uhnPeep that’s the stuff
[3:46:16] VonBonvo: I'm kinda surprised there wasn't an FTO there supervising your bench trial
[3:46:19] toadloadmodechode: @TallyTwo possibly because they can't prove he's selling drugs because of the box spiel uhnHm KEKW
[3:46:20] Stan28Z: they should add a charge for this stuff trade of oxy or something
[3:46:21] GusBlue: @uberhaxornova was Judd trying to be nice not charging him with perjury?  The lies were pretty blatant
[3:46:21] mnk_tropic: does sale of drugs not also cover the buying of drugs? like how the sale of a weapon also covers the buyer I think? or nah?

[3:46:40] TheMooMooCow: the weird part about oxy is that you are technically receiving it not selling it, so the judges charges would make more sense
[3:46:42] pr4vus: basically nobody gets perjury :\
[3:46:43] zrialf: a sting on an oxy runner would be cool where cops roll up UC to buy some pills off the guy, then you got sale for sure

[3:47:02] tally_one: @toadloadmodechode I can’t wait for cops to pull up on oxy sales and say “hey shows it going, good luck on that oxy run” since it sets that kinda precedent

[3:48:18] jawnwick99: First bench trial was so sick. Good night chat I’m tapped out
[3:48:18] ronjohnstonn: @LegendaryGirt how can you prove he didnt just have  a wad of cash in his pocket tho? i fully agree with you but that seems to be the same line of thinking as "whats in the box?" but its wild because x lost his case over pocket money bc he had to prove where it came from. so sometimes the state doesnt need to provide evidence but sometimes it does from what ive seen, based on the case

[3:55:18] celcelcel__: theres heaps of shit cadets dont get taught, you have to run with people like wrangler or rhodes to learn more
[3:55:19] NoWayRightNow: seems like its not worth going after oxy runners till they leave and have max amount on them @UberHaxorNova
[3:55:22] dotzaq: Its how Dan sees it ic
[3:55:22] Tru7hyDv8: Coyote calls out the loopholes in this instance

[3:55:32] cr1wave: just be like copper. Down with the DOJ KEKW
[3:55:39] MisterTohru: It’s literally just Judd. That charge was created with those oxy runs in mind
[3:55:44] BaneZarfox: KEKW
[3:55:44] Actual_Nicotine: Just need a description on the box, solves everything. What would make sense is if the box is raw ingredients, and you get pills in return
[3:55:48] 615maskedman: baas definitely fucked since cayo is his judge
[3:55:50] cellojakers: Find out what they do with the oxy
[3:55:52] Tru7hyDv8: But in this case, seems best to wait until they drive the vehicle then arrest them
[3:55:55] TheM4chine: It's strange that there isn't an all encompassing "Exchange of Drugs" charge or something... it would cover sells, purchases, and trades
[3:56:00] Forser: Castieleth, Wrangler isn't the best there really. Rhodes yes but Wrangler is a loose canon
[3:56:00] Schmiddtyy: The fact is Coyote does have a point on the "whats in the box" but its literally just mechanics at that point lmao
[3:56:00] phileo45: Is that the same judge who dropped a gta charge after the suspect threw car from the pier in the ocean?
[3:56:00] Jeled: Really need that new judge for shift 3 to get crims now LUL
[3:56:02] Tru7hyDv8: can get them for joyriding
[3:56:03] morghoull: dirty grinder peepoSus
[3:56:05] Gemblar: I think either an admin has to definitely say oxy runs = sale of drugs, or a dev has to put a descriptor on the box labeled "drugs"
[3:56:06] RezaQ8: @UberHaxorNova Thats why I was confused because Daisy said the other day that she was getting bank records from people selling oxy due to Sale of drugs so I am confused too
[3:56:06] GalatiaAK: YEP
[3:56:08] chocodreamzzz: yup, you can think you have a solid case all you want. does not mean you can prove it in court

[3:56:16] Mrazov: grinders haven
[3:56:16] dotzaq: Grinder hours aswell too
[3:56:16] TheGhostFather: money laudering
[3:56:17] 420thMagicMan: Coyote just has the standard of reasonable doubt unlike a lot of judges and cops don’t know the difference between probable cause and beyond a reasonable doubt
[3:56:18] pr4vus: nah wrangler just has a bad rep and trolls cops a lot
[3:56:20] ArJayHeart: Only way is to for PD to ask the Mayor to change the charge
[3:56:21] HardMental: If you found guilty by the judge and if you can't pay for the charges do you actually serve the time in jail?
[3:56:23] Ayjayyyx: KEKW
[3:56:23] wongkhy: OMEGALUL K
[3:56:23] VonBonvo: on Lenny's first bench trial the same thing almost happened because he wasn't articulating the charged correctly but baas was there and was able to help him out which got the charges to stick. it's all about how you articulate it in court @uberhaxornova
[3:56:23] tedbear_85: OK
[3:56:23] reMdan: @UberHaxorNova yeah it'd get thrown bc it simply doesnt fit

[3:56:45] Ftgneobeast: Just look in the box Kappa
[3:56:45] AvWorgen: Barry is a very thorough cop
[3:56:46] Jeled: @MilkmeMilty1moreTime Yes it was a local police car into a lake
[3:56:46] chocodreamzzz: it sounds like its a F on the mechanic. someone found a lope hole that you can't prove what is in the boxes.
[3:56:49] cr1wave: charge should be updated to sale/purchase of drugs or something along those lines
[3:56:49] corhamber: court law is quite different from civil law
[3:56:50] NoWayRightNow: that was different than this
[3:56:54] MisterTohru: Nah Barry articulated it fine
[3:56:55] toadloadmodechode: He articulated it well enough though KEKW
[3:56:56] RezaQ8: The pictures are literally there there needs no articulation KEKW
[3:56:57] harvardwsf: Coyote just has the standard of reasonable doubt unlike a lot of judges and cops don’t know the difference between probable cause and beyond a reasonable doubt ---- true

[3:56:59] Confettys: moon was fuming after that case KEKW
[3:57:00] dotzaq: Say he had money on him
[3:57:00] pr4vus: nah there was literally nothing he could have done better there
[3:57:01] Brennanan: you can't
[3:57:02] Tuk3s: it wasnt a problem with articulation in this case
[3:57:05] Jaafil: MCD did that bulletin because there is no work around it because you cant prove drugs in the box
[3:57:07] VonBonvo: it's not about the boxes in these cases @uberhaxornova
[3:57:08] Grobyc117: You can't do anything Judd will never rule against that because it's unknown
[3:57:08] Ayjayyyx: just articulate it bro KEKW
[3:57:09] mcdonaldsblackcoffee: Sell oxy in sting op
[3:57:09] Lanthin: you can't. there is no charge for it.
[3:57:10] dotzaq: Money = sale
[3:57:10] n7merc18: I thought Barry did perfect
[3:57:11] RedxYeti: just articulate it james 4Head
[3:57:12] MattFarrow_: nothing you could do
[3:57:12] ka1o5: NODDERS exactly

[3:57:14] NastyStewie: Barry Oxy Investigation arc
[3:57:14] Grobyc117: Coyote rather*
[3:57:15] Brennanan: there was literally nothing else you could've done
[3:57:15] EvidentGhost: yeah, its really just the contents of the boxes that makes it difficult
[3:57:16] Tru7hyDv8: They need to clarify whats in the box OR change the charge to Sale/Purchase of drugs
[3:57:17] rawrs64: I'm super suprised the judge didn't even want to see the pictures
[3:57:17] mossad321: @UberHaxorNova just open the box 4HEad
[3:57:19] KeefBall: it really doesnt matter sometimes. depends what judge you get most of the time
[3:57:20] Evexsan: Its not the same issue with this case. The perp could literally confess to anything with the box, and the charges would have been the same
[3:57:20] oilless: Just articulate better PepegaPhone
[3:57:21] FAA_the_guy: just do it 4Head
[3:57:22] syneesia: Box argument kinda stupid tbh, its beyond your control
[3:57:24] MisterTohru: Judd has beyond a shadow of a doubt and the other judges have beyond a “reasonable” doubt
[3:57:25] EddieEXP: what even is a box uhnHm
[3:57:25] Coco2355: just rp it out Kappa
[3:57:25] VonBonvo: or not about what is inside of them
[3:57:27] sahnteeno: Just a mechanic issue it seems
[3:57:29] 615maskedman: mcd should tell the department about the cleaning money shit
[3:57:29] coldbleb: Use a crowbar on a box? SHRUGGERS
[3:57:31] GumbyMMA: Whatever the box is, is "suspicious". That's it
[3:57:32] cellojakers: Find what they do with the oxy they for then
[3:57:33] Forser: As Dan said, you did right. Just unlucky that you got Coyote
[3:57:33] TrigginFypo: @rawrs64 he obviously saw the pictures in the report
[3:57:35] toadloadmodechode: Yea the 'sale' part of it is what is the problem KEKW
[3:57:35] Uberpwnageman: i thought it was like the oxy runs in 2.0 where you sometimes get some product back from selling the oxy
[3:57:37] Soffeli: NODDERS
[3:57:38] NoWayRightNow: @UberHaxorNova i guess to get the biggest charge then would be to wait till they leave and catch them with max amount
[3:57:39] Milkomeda: PepegaPhone Articulate better
[3:57:41] Sir_Proton: @uberhaxornova they should prob make a charge for reciving illegal drugs etc
[3:57:41] AnyaFlux: even if it was money, it's still not sale of drugs
[3:57:41] pee_poopbutt: Burden of proof is so fucking high for cops LUL
[3:57:41] NoWayRightNow: yeah
[3:57:43] dotzaq: Yeah and that sucks
[3:57:44] Confettys: viggy selling his bike on twatter KEKW
[3:57:44] tedbear_85: How much of a fine is Perjury?
[3:57:46] morghoull: what if the box is a bomb uhnD
[3:57:47] MattFarrow_: could just say they already had it
[3:57:48] ArJayHeart: Base has info about it from prior arrests
[3:57:50] glasses_Blac: Vbucks in the boxes
[3:57:52] rawrs64: @TrigginFypo Ohh didn't realise judges had access to that, makes sense
[3:57:53] Augmentedfrog: why wouldn't they just say it fell out of the box?
[3:57:53] Rooberz27: Chat, how did the bench trial go?
[3:57:55] Region_8: doesn't the sale of drugs charge say selling or receiving?
[3:57:55] AlexRuiz__: imagine if all you had to do was say some stupid shit like "we have the boxes he was peddling in custody so you can search them"
[3:57:55] sign_g3: The box is actually a mystery both in IC and OOC
[3:57:57] NumbFootToiletTuesday: stake them out and follow them i guess?
[3:57:57] ginoxys: thats probably to encourage stake-out RP? idk
[3:57:57] vynfu: its just a problem with game mechanics and maybe a change needed with the wording of the law imo
[3:58:00] thehashslangingslasher: sogSully sogSully sogSully sog3
[3:58:01] RedxYeti: follow them across town to each spot hahaha
[3:58:02] ArJayHeart: Baas
[3:58:03] theCrazySauce: the way you get the boxes is pretty shady so maybe selling of stolen goods?
[3:58:03] tyronemoney: oxy charges just require more work then
[3:58:04] MinxyLou: Can you not like, RP it out that there's drugs in the box or something?
[3:58:04] chocodreamzzz: yeah in Oxy if you think about it, you are not selling drugs you buying them
[3:58:07] jaydwag11: Look just follow them for there entire lifes until they sell the oxy and make sure you take a picture of every footstep along the way
[3:58:12] Nightbot: Be sure to hit the 'Follow' button below the video player to be notified when James goes live! uhnHeart
[3:58:12] ApathyEmbodied: @Rooberz27 Sale of drugs dropped. Found guilty on the possession.
[3:58:13] Sir_Proton: Chat this isn’t about burden of proof problem, it’s a legislation problem
[3:58:13] dotzaq: What does the description of the box actually say @UberHaxorNova
[3:58:13] slpperysloth: some cases you win some you dont just gotta do your best like you did anyway
[3:58:14] hustlelikebergy: @uberhaxornova I’d say siz was caught with a cook of meth is that still just misdemeanor possession?
[3:58:14] NoWayRightNow: they just gotta change the charge or the box it seems like, there is no reason for there to be a mechanic that is so confusing LUL
[3:58:14] AnyaFlux: it's only sale of drugs if it's other drugs in the box
[3:58:16] Legendoftiny: Tell the judge the people in car have a special tool and open the box and hand you the oxy
[3:58:19] tally_one: Start going for raids instead track them back to the apartments?
[3:58:19] ZLE99: Wouldn’t the box not contain the oxy materials
[3:58:20] cellojakers: Gotta find when they sell the oxy
[3:58:20] tombovard: @UberHaxorNova Then you'd get, "how did you know the defendant received that money for the oxy and not some other previous thing?" uhnKek
[3:58:21] AlanIshihara: need a undercover cop for that
[3:58:22] mcdonaldsblackcoffee: Charge with racketeering EZ CLAP
[3:58:23] jj1remix: You might have to 311 Daisy again?
[3:58:24] Zeizkal: it was a learning experience at the very least
[3:58:28] bong_puncher: Barry looks like Jamie Hyneman from Mythbusters. If you wore a Baret
[3:58:29] AnyaFlux: because there is no "Buying Drugs" charge
[3:58:29] Ayjayyyx: 578 PepeLaugh
[3:58:29] 3spada_Grande: have crims not been been caught at every step by now
[3:58:29] Rooberz27: @ApathyEmbodied Damn. Okay ty for telling me!
[3:58:30] Voltorin: I wonder if adding a new charge called "exchange of drugs" or something would fix the mystery box oxy situation uhnHm
[3:58:33] syneesia: Daisy modCheck
[3:58:34] will_scottt: is selling without a business license outside of the farmers markets legal? could be something there maybe
[3:58:38] karrotkake0: KEKW
[3:58:38] Zypheraa: :tf: /me opens box full of drugs
[3:58:40] Bigxmage: @uberhaxornova have the boxes labeled at stolen good
[3:58:44] syneesia: Too bad siz only suffers
[3:58:44] thatcatarthur: You could Say it was your understanding that state recognizes that the trade of box for oxy is a charge of sale of narcotics right?
[3:58:46] 420thMagicMan: U can win a case with coyote if u prove beyond a reasonable doubt, cops don’t understand that concept and most judges just rule guilty if they have probable cause @uberhaxornova
[3:58:47] Tuk3s: I think judd's stance is that there needs to be a "sale" to be made for the sale of drugs charge. And by definition "sale" is the exchange of goods for money; so the fact that he doesn't know what is in the box makes the charge not stick
[3:58:51] Hento: its just a shitty loophole that cant really be closed, cause there is no mechanic to open the boxes....
[3:58:52] ronjohnstonn: crims should just give up banks and run oxy LUL
[3:58:58] dotzaq: Anyone know what the label on the boxes say?
[3:58:59] Tsorer: im just glad the crim wasnt a Siz tbh PepeLaugh
[3:58:59] BPJulio: catJAM
[3:58:59] 144pjesus: sale of drugs doesn't mean just money for drugs
[3:58:59] Lanthin: a purchase of drugs charged could be made
[3:59:03] ApathyEmbodied: @will_scottt Unauthorized sales? KEKLEO
[3:59:04] ykicka: you could see Judd was just as frustrated with that one as he 100% gets where pd comes from with that , despite how he ruled.
[3:59:04] omlyn: Could the boxes be labeled as sell of stolen goods, since their selling goods from a vehicle that isn’t theirs?
[3:59:05] Drax_1X: they're gotta be a way to make it sound like there's Oxy in the boxes, like 'these boxes are known to police to be part of Oxy transactions'
[3:59:05] tally_one: You might have better luck trailing their storage of oxy in the apartments, and pushing a raid instead if sales not a thing
[3:59:06] MrDrPepper34: they should just add buying or exchange of illegal substances without a license as a charge
[3:59:11] morghoull: add a box cutter item Kappa
[3:59:18] xxSamurai_Bearxx: howdy y'all, what's happening with Barry?
[3:59:23] AnyaFlux: yup
[3:59:24] Hento: no its because there may not be drugs in the box, so how can it be sales of drugs?
[3:59:27] AnyaFlux: you get it now
[3:59:28] syneesia: What's in the box meta is back KEMW
[3:59:28] chocodreamzzz: i see what the Judge is saying. the Oxy runner is exchanging a box FOR oxy, they are not selling drugs
[3:59:30] jackbbj: Any other judge might have just gone with the charge.
[3:59:31] toadloadmodechode: @UberHaxorNova You were also told to not get Coyote, probably for that reason PepeLaugh
[3:59:32] Pepsiguy2009: undercover sell a box with a go pro in tow KEKLEO
[3:59:32] Buzzabeel: @xxsamurai_bearxx uhnHello

[3:59:36] phodell: Money is was in the trunk proof of sale
[3:59:37] Grobyc117: Yup
[3:59:38] tyronemoney: @Drax_1X yes but that require dev changes hes trying to figure out how to do it now
[3:59:38] Wolfs_Son: to be fair the judges wrote the law in a confusing way, and kind of impossible to prove in gta way
[3:59:38] toadloadmodechode: @UberHaxorNova Well, now you were told PepeLaugh
[3:59:40] YewFancy: I just don’t understand why it’s not illegal to purchase the oxy
[3:59:41] mcdonaldsblackcoffee: Racketeering
[3:59:42] Tru7hyDv8: Possession and joyriding
[3:59:42] El_Nalgon123: @UberHaxorNova its really simple the answer is

[3:59:49] ronjohnstonn: just because you were told something in a meeting doesnt mean its law, just how they are trying to do it i guess
[3:59:49] tombovard: it's a failure in there being no law to define the EXCHANGE/trade of drugs as illegal
[3:59:50] 144pjesus: sale of drugs doesn't mean just money for drugs
[3:59:50] dotzaq: Ig you could makeup whats in the box lmao
[3:59:52] Tru7hyDv8: If you wait until they drive evhicle
[3:59:54] cr1wave: so the charge has to fundamentally be changed to apply to oxy sales
[3:59:54] espino1a: was the car even his?
[3:59:55] Evexsan: The only solution is to find out whats in the box, and find a charge that fits with that action :D
[3:59:56] JpRico: thier trading drugs?
[4:00:00] Forser: Other judges has ruled it as Sale of Drugs, just Coyote that says no
[4:00:01] Tuckerbonage: @uberhaxornova what about purchasing of drugs with dirty money could that stick to oxy runs?
[4:00:03] thatcatarthur: Sounds like selling oxy is a ez clap

[4:21:21] Riuzaku: what if they only want to get people for possession?
[4:21:23] RezaQ8: Coyote said that there is PC to catch these people because the hand off would tell the cops that they have possession of Oxy right? @UberHaxorNova

[4:26:52] Actual_Nicotine: @ronjohnstonn why would you give someone a box of oxy to get one bottle of oxy back? Makes no sense. There isn't oxy in the box
[4:26:52] ArJayHeart: @Wolfs_Son the animation of the handoff is taken as you actually seing what is being exchanged so if get pictures of that it is enough
