[3:34:58] Clodhoppr: yea thats what i read
[3:35:00] Clodhoppr: yup
[3:35:08] Harmage: @OmegaTooYew It's due to how old GTA is.. conflicting with GTA engine

[3:36:55] OmegaTooYew: @Harmage gotchu gotchu, makes sense NODDERS i gotta imagine such heavily modded stuff has some unique issues
[3:36:59] assassin6107: Need to run resolution at probably 1440p.   144 hz is display refresh. Set graphics at one below max and use that as baseline
[3:37:03] Clodhoppr: looks better already i think
[3:37:08] TeamLiquid: Break Through Your Game with the new Alienware Pro Wireless Mouse and Keyboard!  go.adv.gg/MYb9c_
