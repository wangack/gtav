[2:43:40] 0xygenhomie: i guess if youre not assigned to the bank robbery, you switch to radio 2
[2:43:42] PaulScelus: Guess it's now just like, cruise around mindlessly until Dispatch says go somewhere? Otherwise, everything's "not my problem"?
[2:43:43] Actual_Nicotine: anti-copstacking rules NODDERS

[2:44:38] JojoIGNB: i feel like youd respond depending on the area you are near or patrolling
[2:44:39] Actual_Nicotine: IT sound weird but then 911s are also constant, there'll be no lack of calls to go to
[2:44:44] Ham_Alh: In practice everything might click well
[2:44:45] LijeBaley: The sad thing is I don't know if they can inform you the of the the mechanic reason as it is being down to fix the radio bug
[2:44:48] tombovard: KEKW

[2:44:53] a_wet_meatball: They are fine with people calling in that they are responding to a situation, but they are going to assign people who are not saying they are busy or telling units to leave if there are more than needed.
[2:44:55] iampipoy: you can still patrol and do traffic stops

[2:45:16] agoodcry: alot of mix signals but i understand his view point
[2:45:17] ZeusGodofCalamity: How would this work for cadets trying to get a specific sign off?

[2:45:19] tinytoadtiddies: indepth rp nodders
[2:45:27] KroberJamm: it worked well during shift 1 so hopefully it keeps up
[2:45:28] Dustelix: @oxygenhomie traffic stops and such you still call in and do on your own atleast thats what shift 1 was doing
[2:45:32] mangocubes_: sounds kinda like the other shifts are falling behind on 911s/311s so shift 3 has to change aswell?
[2:45:34] Milkomeda: @syneesia or 7 cop cars for a jay walker KEKW
[2:45:38] tombovard: so they PD finally gave into the "X cops for this?!" meme KEKW

[2:47:29] JungleG: They already tried to do that and no one listened

[2:47:34] Asai22: i think ppl aren't paying attention to the number of units on scene

[2:47:37] pepsava: @UberHaxorNova I think it's for people that don't do much
[2:47:37] JungleG: the limit for 80's is supposed to be 3-4 cars
[2:47:38] 0xygenhomie: i think its more of incorporating irl dispatch rp
[2:47:38] BPJulio: uhnKek
[2:47:38] PaulScelus: People don't listen I guess is the problem. You can say "limit 3 cops in chase" but as Davenport said, people are showing up without announcing it.

[2:47:46] 144pjesus: who has dispatch pov
[2:47:47] b_pilgrim: They also want people responding to 911s so it's more than the unit limit

[2:47:49] bangsssss: negotiater, WH OMEGALUL

[2:47:58] syneesia: lorenzo only likes siz as his pool boy KEKW
[2:48:00] lamille98: I think they are fine with like 10 cops on a 80 if theres nothing else to do
[2:48:07] JpRico: i think the problems is radio comms, too many units talking
[2:48:08] lil_caldito: The thing I guess is that in theory they limit but people don't pay attention and do whatever they want
[2:48:10] RedPandaKFC: I think this is trying to create more dispatch RP and it'll just happen to maybe solve other problems like the cop stacking on one issue to the detriment of other calls.

[3:05:01] xacktastic: They dont want to limit units, have cops wiped, and crims just walk out
[3:05:10] templar45: NODDERS
[3:05:11] PaulScelus: I mean, I guess as long as people stop just talking on the radio for any and all reasons, it'll be quieter.
[3:05:13] RedChu: it was weird
[3:05:13] Thomarse: Crims abuse limits
[3:05:13] citehcitehcitehciteh: people need to respect dispatch tho
[3:05:14] Actual_Nicotine: but a limit means you can't increase if you need to

[3:05:28] DubiousDelirium: No way uhnKek
[3:05:30] mnk_tropic: think you'll get solo today?
[3:05:32] CensoredTH0ughTs: i think they want to limit radio traffic in the process
[3:05:34] LijeBaley: It's needed for a lot of reasons. One was the radio bug with the amount on radio @uberhaxornova
[3:05:36] 0xygenhomie: they said dynamic
[3:05:36] Echofear: they just need a soft limit
[3:05:38] db_Supra: Andrew said didnt work out. they did try in 2.0
[3:05:39] ChimPumPauluz: If you do that vault I’ll stay awake and miss class tomorrow uhnCozy
[3:05:39] tombovard: I mean it doesn't have to be a hard limit, what about calling BACKUP KEKW
[3:05:41] EvidentGhost: i feel like part of it is definitely just to make Dispatch feel more involved as well.
[3:05:48] LijeBaley: Like the bug came from the overload
[3:05:52] xacktastic: There are lots of ways to go about it, im sure it will work out
[3:05:52] curioddity: Andrews doesn't want hard limits and people haven't been good about limiting themselves
[3:05:56] NeoGyokuto: that's essentially what they do is limit cops but change when other calls come up or the situation becomes more serious
[3:05:57] ClassifiedGnar: if 13a happens all can respond yea
[3:05:59] puppybear_oso_: does James use a certain playlist because these songs are great!
[3:06:03] EL_GWOPO: Whats a 13 alpha drassThink
[3:06:05] Wiggly_Mew: has barry sent in or talked to anyone about joining the rangers yet?
[3:06:10] CplDarkeye: @EL_GWOPO officer down
[3:06:13] 0xygenhomie: im sure dispatch will alert everyone to join the 13a
[3:06:13] IrizZero: the limit is depend in how many cop are online
[3:06:13] ACChillin: is it only radio or voice as well?
[3:06:14] marcusi23: @rimestyle cops has always been limited since 2.0. but you still see every cop show up to one scene or 6 cop cars in 1 chase when the limit is 3
[3:06:18] 3spada_Grande: Think it worked so well because it was Andrews Calling the shots
[3:06:22] EL_GWOPO: oh ok @CplDarkeye ty
[3:06:23] 420thMagicMan: Didn’t work in 2.0, cops couldn’t b trusted with limiting themselves so now dispatch is in charge of it
[3:06:29] Htial: Limits require a lot of self-policing and most people don't want to give up their spot in situations.
[3:06:36] PunishedJester: @puppybear28 Last song was 1987 by Lucy in Disguise.
[3:06:40] sirlongshlongg: call 1007
[3:06:42] Camloon_: That wont happen if you are 10-7
[3:06:45] EvidentGhost: @Archiux yeah, rangers actually need someone for this time frame, and Barry is the only one who stepped forward
[3:06:49] 0xygenhomie: They said you can let dispatch know
[3:06:52] tesssaa: I think you'd be allowed to say you're busy with something
[3:06:55] cocoa_puff2: is the stream over? or is he taking a short break?
[3:06:58] Chasmanj: Just watched the haunted trains video on YouTube. How far behind is that versus this present stream?
[3:07:02] Purplevivid: cops rush for paleto anyway
[3:07:03] Ham_Alh: Hes not 10-7 tho hes patroling
[3:07:09] CensoredTH0ughTs: when andrews was doing it earlier a big part of it was no unnecessary radio traffic was allowed also
[3:07:13] Taken_Name_: if your on a call they wont change you
[3:07:16] RedChu: maybe they need a new 10code for it
[3:07:21] tonypepperoni52: Pretty far
[3:07:23] CaptainAsthma: 10-7 I'm watching people fishing
[3:07:25] Legendoftiny: Even when limiting numbers calls still go unattended cause people just don’t want to go to them this way calls get attention
[3:07:25] 0xygenhomie: you may be overthinking it, it wont be that strict lol
[3:07:26] cocoa_puff2: oh nevermind
[3:07:31] Duckback: Sounds like they're using 10-7 to be the I'm doing what I want too.
[3:07:32] syneesia: blblblblb FLIPPY
[3:07:35] PrismaIris: Ripley said it best there they need something to show that the unit is busy versus if they're free, like a new 10-code or a yellow/green button

[3:08:22] ChimPumPauluz: What ever happened with the lawyer that was gonna clean your money?
[3:08:26] a_wet_meatball: They are not trying to just randomly pull people across the map and busy into the middle of something, its just to assign or send away units as necessary because at times no one responds to calls because a lot of people just say "nah".
[3:08:29] ACChillin: confusion
[3:08:30] regworth: nobody should be using the radio other dispatch for the majority of it though
[3:08:30] Funsized: dispatch is basically playing air traffic controller now
[3:08:33] Discontinuance: Flippy always gives a weird number of minutes. It's never five or ten, it's like three or seven.
[3:08:35] otisbdriftwood_: vteGun
