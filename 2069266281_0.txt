[0:45:52] FilzG: chief of police and sheriff wont solve this issue
[0:46:06] TumNarDok: but we can blame them XD
[0:46:13] FilzG: how does another leader solve retention problem?
[0:46:23] SmugPls: making role above Captains isnt solving the issue LUL there needs to be sergeants or somethin LUL
[0:46:24] DumboTheWise: Eternal undersheriff curvyeHypeE
[0:46:46] wintersoldier2712: there needs to be sgts and lts like this week
[0:46:47] eborcurean: there still won't be enough cops in a month for 2 departments
[0:47:03] FilzG: they dont need more leaders, they need more people
[0:47:20] FilzG: FTO work is exhausting
[0:47:29] wintersoldier2712: @FilzG if there were srgts then can deal with hiring and what not
[0:48:34] eborcurean: why need to wait for a cop/sheriff to promote etc. good point
[0:48:36] TumNarDok: those positions were never done by a valid election LUL
[0:49:04] wintersoldier2712: @eborcurean I know it makes no sense after this long
[0:49:12] FilzG: @wintersoldier2712 how about they focus less on handing out daps like candy and instead use that brain power to actively find new people and train them
[0:49:21] SmugPls: @filz my man
[0:49:43] FilzG: the problem isnt not having enough leaders
[0:49:57] eborcurean: @eborcurean it's the big diff to early 3.0 which had super experienced command in their positions from the start, and then rolled out P&T with a full FTO program etc.
[0:49:58] DumboTheWise: curvyeTea
[0:50:02] SukiGraham_: This is a good conversation curvyeCozy
[0:50:08] SmugPls: 1-2 daps running a week is indefinate suspension LUL
[0:50:20] SmugPls: running inside PD* rather
[0:50:33] wintersoldier2712: so give em sargent. then you can do promos and what not
[0:51:20] FilzG: or give more power to seniors then
[0:51:39] FilzG: stop wasting time in promotions and suspensions and daps
[0:52:02] wintersoldier2712: they are running the the sgt capacity so they can give them sgt and then have the promos and what not
[0:52:03] FilzG: you already have seniors, give them more power and tell them to focus on hiring and retention
[0:53:15] TumNarDok: lack of standins was already apparent in the restructure eith low cmd #
[0:53:19] DatDudeJakeC: All the questions you asked are sooooo valid.  Feel like we haven't been given much in the way of answers LUL

[0:59:06] Thallo_Auxo: Some PPOs also have prior experience and can FTO
[1:00:18] FilzG: scary thing is, shift 1 had 1 officer on duty the other day too
[1:01:04] eborcurean: rigid shift issues when there aren't enough cops in any shift makes no sense
[1:01:31] eborcurean: like if someone does 3 hours in one and 2 in another, what's the issue?
[1:02:22] SmugPls: to prevent people joining 3 to sneak into 2 because they wanted 2 initially. Thats the rules thinking at least
[1:02:23] Thallo_Auxo: If they are a cadet/PPO its a bit of an issue when they said they would be Shift 3
[1:02:51] eborcurean: @SmugPls yeah but likewise shift 2 doesn't have enough cops either. it makes sense when 1 shift is low and the other is stacked.
[1:03:10] krisholborn2024: yeah either way it’s another body on the field
[1:03:29] FilzG: so whats the solution? enforce gamers to game at a specific timezone?
[1:03:39] FilzG: or else?
[1:03:44] eborcurean: and some people cross shifts, like EU people who have a RL job and play after will cross 1 into 2
[1:03:56] invisibleTowel: make them apply for the shift they plan to play @FilzG
