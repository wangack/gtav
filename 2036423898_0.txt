[2:18:51] xsetbv: In the worst case add the clientsided entity id to the event you send to the server
[2:19:03] xsetbv: Once you replicate that check on the client if it is identical. If identical skip apply
[2:19:30] xsetbv: if you go out of scope and come back with the owning client, the clientsided entityid will be different and you will apply your own state, even though you own it
