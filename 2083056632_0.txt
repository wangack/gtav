[1:18:18] martymagoo78: dougie and Harry will bring Cypress back to glory
[1:18:59] SpilledNuts: if dougie can get his stars up too, pushing with him for a couple hours seems like an easy way to help the crew, make a bit of cash and hang wiht dougie
[1:19:18] N9NE8: Dougie turning up in a Pfister tomorrow LUL

[1:23:10] SpilledNuts: Teddy could grow all you need honestly
[1:23:29] trillbillv1: I think he meant pushers

[1:27:50] SpilledNuts: WICKED
[1:28:01] thomthepilot19: what’s the difference between this kind of selling and street selling
[1:28:07] Hogie48: lol I remember Browns gangbanging arc where Lang/Leslie hated it
[1:28:15] SpilledNuts: you and Arush holding down cypress sounds like a lot of fun
[1:28:18] SpilledNuts: really holding it down too
[1:28:36] LietK: just need to offload this house so ypu can go nuts
[1:28:41] SpilledNuts: and once the house is out of your name you'll be free to go a bit wild with it
[1:29:02] FiniteResources: harrSTEER
[1:29:06] N9NE8: any buyer for the south side house?
[1:29:14] gatorzghost: gatorzghost subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 3 month streak! 
[1:29:50] thomthepilot19: What’s the difference between this type of pushing and selling on the streets?
[1:30:26] SpilledNuts: when you sell on the streets you go to your 'turf' and pick a spot and people come to you, on this it's more of a delivery
[1:30:30] FiniteResources: harrNODDERS finally less crazy
[1:31:00] LietK: just imagining you pushin in cypress and cookin moonshine at the same time
[1:31:01] mike9904_: harrSTEER
[1:31:24] thomthepilot19: @spillednuts thanks, that’s what I thought it would be, but didn’t know if there was anything else.
[1:32:09] thomthepilot19: like most money difference or something
[1:32:33] SpilledNuts: @thomthepilot19 you have to get 100 stars with the delivery guy before you can street sell. Street selling is more money, can push more weed
[1:33:17] N9NE8: the sewers are getting hot
[1:34:03] thomthepilot19: @spillednuts Ah okay, that makes sense. thanks
[1:34:42] mike9904_: Rip
[1:34:59] SpilledNuts: I think sometimes you need to go a bit far away and then come back? i've seen others do that
[1:35:03] seannmheg: Upstairs?
[1:35:29] Proxyiy: i think the rep is not by the job so should be a problem

[5:24:19] Hogie48: Hes for sure had some scuff with griime
[5:30:47] Sword_Scream: @thepwnographer 10% as scuffed as he claims, but he remembers those 10% more than his own fuckups
[5:31:04] Sword_Scream: You always remember the exceptions, it's just human nature
[5:32:01] EyeScraem: madgeNOW its grime time marlo

[5:49:07] bananawonka: They make you look for the option deeper in the options.
[5:49:20] trptguy09: it used to pop up when you clicked subscribe but it now takes clicking subscribe, clicking elevate your subscription then select it
[5:49:21] gasbrain: yeah the first time you sub with a prime its hard, but then it goes to its normal spot which is odd
[5:49:26] TraumaMurse: Only can be on on desktop, or safari with desktop view on phone
[5:49:38] trptguy09: and only on desktop
[5:50:34] Sword_Scream: The optics/good will of prime is what they want, not for people to actually use it
[5:50:41] hallopinyo: good evening chat and Harold
[5:51:30] Sword_Scream: The best thing for Amazon/twitch is just if people forget it, after having used it once, since it doesn't auto renew
[5:51:44] difficultsleep3r: slow for the head pop
[5:52:20] Sword_Scream: Marlo is on some Tony driving

[6:25:54] Sword_Scream: Oh, it just looked fine
[6:26:36] Sword_Scream: I remember when you bought it, and the consensus was it was straight ass. One small change with the engine sound and it's become THE car.
[6:27:06] 1dontreadchat: Cause it doesnt have a transmission
[6:27:10] Sword_Scream: Oh yeah, and the small heat change
[6:27:44] Sword_Scream: For 46k I don't think you can find a better car, it might be tough to find one below 120k that matches it.
[6:28:26] Sword_Scream: Only downside is the small fuel capacity and the overheating, but it's something you can easily work around

[7:29:05] michaelfg89: sitting causes the hip flexor issue, which usually manifests as back or knee pain. I use something called Pso-rite that helps you stretch. you can find it on Amazon
[7:29:17] StamaasG: Backwards on a treadmill with a slight incline is good too
[7:29:21] Zayrow1: i used to have really bad knee pain while running, and with strengthening and stretching its improved a lot
[7:29:35] tacxx_: maybe try one of those adjustable standing desks? thats what my mom does
[7:29:39] michaelfg89: strengthen glutes is usually a big help
[7:29:44] pipobrush: If it's getting worse, might be a torn Meniscus. That'll need a quick surgery Harry
[7:29:44] ForgetMidnight: shoudl watch for your hamstrings too, i had a hamstring inflammation a couple of years ago and i felt it on my knee
[7:29:54] Niktory: yeah i incline walk on treadmill and then estop it and go backwards for a bit
[7:29:55] sad_fat_panda85: elliptical is low impact on joints
[7:29:59] HKIA: I just know the days it's doesn't feel right I take it easier
[7:30:07] PrimarySweets: running stairs is bad if you do it too much
[7:30:09] SkyHawk0404: Yea i got a standing desk its so nice to have the option
[7:30:36] michaelfg89: look up pso-rite on Amazon. it's a little device you lay on to help stretch hip flexors. helps my knee pain a lot.
[7:31:14] SkyHawk0404: prob should do low impact exercises then
[7:31:31] PrimarySweets: you could try a knee brace too if you want. something with compression
[7:31:36] SonyMichael: It sounds like you may have an injury, so exercise may not help.
[7:31:43] ForgetMidnight: did they remove food from the shops?
[7:31:44] birdieroxxx: i have a bad right knee. good exercises i was told to do during PT was with resistance bands.
[7:31:49] SonyMichael: In the short term.
[7:32:33] Niktory: my knees used to be so bad growing up and now my knees are damn near bulletproof i can sit on my calfs w my knees pointed straight out
[7:32:56] Niktory: calves*
[7:33:27] michaelfg89: I do bodybuilding so I'm always lifting around small injuries. careful and slow squats and deadlifts will help the glutes and take tension out of the hip flexor.
