[6:47:10] adzse: The first edition of Minecraft was made in just six days. Markus Persson began work on a game he quite imaginatively titled "Cave Game" on May 10, 2009. Four days into development, Persson renamed the game Minecraft: Order of the Stone. On May 16, Persson had a finished copy of the game‚Äôs Alpha version, with its title reduced to Minecraft, ready to release to private testers ‚Äì and the game was released publicly the very next day! dizzTHINK
