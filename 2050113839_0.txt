[0:10:22] guzeriz: no the call is to order a new pc
[0:10:23] luis_king82: are you connected to cable or wifi.??.. the wifi always breaks @NoraExplorer ..
[0:10:23] ehhazzy: @flocoyoo I wonder if it's a ram stick issue. She's running DDR4 3600 mhz maybe she needs 6000?
[0:10:23] C0ST17: PauseChamp GO TO THE US
[0:10:23] RaverenZero: if it’s new PC then it’s internet issue. some closed ports or vpn
[0:10:26] Mystishi: guys this happened after the storm, it happened to Raia too
[0:10:28] mavericks312: @guzeriz it’s a 2nd pc do you not listen to
[0:10:28] AurelStar: Double PC Set up? Game on one, stream on the other?
[0:10:29] Sadge_I_Watch_Nmplol_: I GUESS STARFORGE IS THE MOVE, NO?
[0:10:29] 5CookieMonster5: Client issue on the server? monkaHmm

[0:10:33] itsforthechildren: or change dns
[0:10:33] pooofle_: maybe ask kristoferyee? i think he helped dima
[0:10:35] BeCooper: must be a internet issue no?
[0:10:36] napkin4872: if its not ur pc or network related, then its ur house
[0:10:37] Yudee: @noraexplorer try VPN
[0:10:38] Logan121Wright: Have you tried to play on another character too on nopixel??
[0:10:40] C0ST17: @0xPlebLeader KEKW
[0:10:41] eFiend: has the modem been rebooted
[0:10:42] xkleiphi: did you try the priority in task manager? @NoraExplorer
[0:10:42] 0_Cl0UDZ: if you want to use vpn i recommend you use Exitlag
[0:10:43] Jersey_Justin: the fact that this is happening to 2 separate PCs is odd
[0:10:44] guzeriz: @mavericks312 time to change internet providers then
[0:10:44] nibustan: New router+modem
[0:10:46] nodokadark: Hello female streamer!
[0:10:47] sirbllake: it could be SLOBS
[0:10:47] guzeriz: yes
[0:10:47] Mackn9ne: Yea
[0:10:48] relentless_: yes
[0:10:48] QuakerG: Hey Nora, LadyDima had this exact same issue, and she fixed it in 1 day. Maybe she can help you.
[0:10:48] Bestevenn_: YEP
[0:10:48] d91h230em9: no

[0:10:50] shiru_0: no
[0:10:50] kkdott: YEP
[0:10:51] janar55321: it would
[0:10:51] Hermanzand: Well tbh it might just be connection to the server
[0:10:51] Staerys: No
[0:10:51] misNu: Not necessarily
[0:10:51] sinful_desires: Your stream would be messed up
[0:10:51] AurelStar: It's def not internet problem
[0:10:51] peterx_14: no
[0:10:51] jaswho2: not necessarily
[0:10:51] lol_l997: NO
[0:10:52] Wesker889: no
[0:10:52] xfirepop: you would think
[0:10:52] Icemaan03: no
[0:10:52] prettysolidgaming: yes
[0:10:52] abdoss: not nessearyly
[0:10:53] Bisroko: YEP
[0:10:53] bluff1n: you can have faster internet but bad routing to a server or area
[0:10:54] SpaceG33k: not necessarily
[0:10:54] guzeriz: it would
[0:10:54] janar55321: thats why its not
[0:10:54] eFiend: logically yes
[0:10:54] d91h230em9: not if its a rounting issue
[0:10:54] ehhazzy: It's deffo not internet
[0:10:55] Kemmons: yeah
[0:10:55] Janman88: not if just GTA laggs
[0:10:55] ediez: it would
[0:10:55] theogrelord619: your sister would be having issues too
[0:10:57] renaldorini: if it is routing to those IP's no
[0:10:57] thegweatcthulhu: yes
[0:10:58] 7TheDevil7: Na, could just shit ping to the server
[0:10:58] BeCooper: yes
[0:10:58] buffalobeast210: not necessarily
[0:10:58] Icemaan03: Latency
[0:10:58] rvft1: different server
[0:10:58] C0ST17: not neccessarily
[0:10:58] j_pandy: @guzeriz are you dense? THIS IS A DIFFERENT PC
[0:10:59] rundeeznutsmarket: It's not the interneet
[0:10:59] napkin4872: did u try offline games? @NoraExplorer
[0:11:00] 5CookieMonster5: so you good
[0:11:01] MrHapyPants: It can
[0:11:01] Ficusonishe: not really
[0:11:01] XelloS_05: Could be packet loss or some shit
[0:11:02] Mr_Stevex: in server press F8 and enter cl_drawperf <true> will show showing performance metrics in the screen corner:
[0:11:02] cactusmaxx98: maybe
[0:11:02] sinful_desires: So its not internet
[0:11:02] Daravon01: No cause you are feeding to a server in America
[0:11:02] Mackn9ne: It would mess with salma's too
[0:11:03] TestPaprika: probably
[0:11:03] itsforthechildren: seems to be a download problem?
[0:11:04] Fl4sHerOfficial: thatd effect ur sister too but shes fine
[0:11:04] shaaku007: Its the GTA
[0:11:05] RaverenZero: it could be specific ports for No pixel.
[0:11:07] SpaceG33k: twitch is on server in eu
[0:11:07] noezx: Not necessarily
[0:11:08] Icemaan03: Try speedtest pls
[0:11:08] SupportYourLocalLurker: it’s a game performance issue I don’t think vpn will do anything.
[0:11:08] 13theux: not really
[0:11:08] BeCooper: maybe obs?
[0:11:09] Puupeetzz: I mean, networl issues are complicated
[0:11:09] Bloopser: is it only on nopixel?
[0:11:09] peterx_14: not really
[0:11:10] doctor_makxx: it's 146% not internet problem, chat people are stupid
[0:11:11] SpaceG33k: nopixel is in us
[0:11:12] JDaviz11: have you ran the pc on another game and had issues?
[0:11:12] cactusmaxx98: it might have to do with the server connection
[0:11:14] sealhond: not necessarily
[0:11:14] Mystishi: Have you tried redownloading fivem??
[0:11:14] ehhazzy: @noraexplorer is this PC also running on DDR4 RAM?
[0:11:14] VaeelL: if it affect Rust and GTA it's def a network problem
[0:11:14] Janman88: a new PC should have fixed it
[0:11:14] jbt445: its the NP servers
[0:11:15] Tenivir: it is the connection with the server in that case
[0:11:16] Tonsukii: its your connection to the NoPixel server
[0:11:16] napkin4872: did u try offline games? @NoraExplorer  󠀀
[0:11:16] andy293: can you play vanilla gta 5 without problems?
[0:11:17] Zavgu: maybe the character is bugged in game
[0:11:17] Logan121Wright: Your feed is crisp
[0:11:17] KurtisNagey: has to be something in the settings but there are so many options
[0:11:17] BananasOP89: no necessarily
[0:11:18] guzeriz: time to get new internet provider i guess
[0:11:18] itsforthechildren: do a quick speedtest
[0:11:19] d91h230em9: It's could be a routing issue
[0:11:19] heyimtommy4: @NoraExplorer could literally just somehow be something shitty between your connection and the nopixel server. not your whole internet in general
[0:11:19] knobex: could be just the connection to zthe gta server
[0:11:20] World384: u might have to factory reset pc to be safe
[0:11:21] broxx909: Try offline game
[0:11:21] abdoss: just try the vpn tbh
[0:11:22] Flocoyoo: @ehhazzy i don't think it has to do with the pc itself
[0:11:22] TTUCROWN: could be your internet provider throttling your bandwidth though.
[0:11:22] 42arc: you might need to open game ports, they migth be firewalled
[0:11:25] Daravon01: it is your connection to the server I think
[0:11:25] RaverenZero: You can have firewall etc blocking no pixel specific data
[0:11:25] DJsnapattack: @noraexplorer does the game play ok if your not streaming?
[0:11:26] Sivvii_: fivem forums said that a vpn can help
[0:11:27] LokiTheElusive: It's unlikely to be a internet issue since you get the exact same on Rust but Stream is fine
[0:11:28] joemadden1989: It depends the routing to the server could be affected but routes to twitch are ok
[0:11:28] Bloopser: vpn to USA probably
[0:11:29] XelloS_05: Maybe play rust and check for a little bit
[0:11:30] L0ddz: might just be ping issue
[0:11:31] napkin4872: did u try offline games? @NoraExplorer Try playing gta offline first
[0:11:31] janar55321: @Bloopser nope was lagging in rust as weöö
[0:11:32] noezx: Not a speed issue but could still be another networking problem
[0:11:34] arq_th_ur: Same amount of yes and no in the chat OMEGALUL
[0:11:34] BeCooper: V
[0:11:34] DexRuffin: Is it working for your sister on her setup?
[0:11:36] coletrain1217: yo
[0:11:37] leaavz: might as well try using a vpn tbh
[0:11:37] C0ST17: noraexOkay
[0:11:38] DragonMatt81: what if it is something on your gta character? clothing, scuffed item that is causing issues @NoraExplorer
[0:11:39] AurelStar: In Nora we trust Prayge
[0:11:40] cactusmaxx98: Prayge
[0:11:41] Wisdomism: has to be server
[0:11:43] Sivvii_: Prayge
[0:11:43] Logan121Wright: its probably the gta servers fault
[0:11:44] C0ST17: Prayge
[0:11:44] Bestevenn_: Prayge
[0:11:44] Yudee: @noraexplorer its NP connection server issue, not your internet, so you still better try VPN
[0:11:46] TheGamer_MJ: Hey. You. Yes. You I’m Proud of you blauL blauL blauL
[0:11:46] IraqiWizard: @NoraExplorer resetting your router is NOT turning it off and on, you have to use a needle to push a small reset button on the router, this will reset your passwords and wifi as well. After you need to look into portforwarding and making sure FiveM uses a dedicated port.. i have solved hundreds of issues doing this in tech support
[0:11:47] Wesker889: you can try the command set net_maxMtu 1200 or use a vpn
[0:11:48] iGreeek: @noraexplorer between your internet modem and your pc, is there another device or more than 1 cables?
[0:11:48] pearlmaer: Prayge  󠀀
[0:11:49] Mystishi: TRY REDOWNLOADING FIVEM!!!
[0:11:50] jesleaks: Maybe it's something specific to your account in NoPixel? Either that or internet issue @NoraExplorer
[0:11:52] VaeelL: the techs guy didn't help ?
[0:11:52] ShanksO_: @world384 this is a different pc
[0:11:54] MrHapyPants: But routing for a live mmo ish game is alot different then stream
[0:11:54] Liink93: Prayge
[0:11:55] Mr_Stevex: in server press F8 and enter cl_drawperf <true> will show showing performance metrics in the screen corner
[0:11:55] porreswe: MmmHmm
[0:11:56] 5CookieMonster5: it look like a Server issue, client management level
[0:11:56] buffalobeast210: your modem could be having packet loss while loading custom assets from fivem
[0:11:56] luckifytv: supid question, did you change outfit in game druing all this? @NoraExplorer
[0:12:01] Marilyn_1020: it is probably something that the server did that is messing with you
[0:12:06] 7TheDevil7: Try this: F8, netgraph 1 in the console.
[0:12:07] eFiend: longshot, try different character.
[0:12:08] Liink93: Prayge vpn
[0:12:10] tiny_medic: It's the ping in the game, can you check it?
[0:12:16] ehhazzy: @flocoyoo :(
[0:12:17] WabbitTwouble: Chat hold on, I forgot my popcorn
[0:12:19] Wesker889: Prayge VPN
[0:12:22] mavericks312: which means your other PC is probably fine
[0:12:23] Kemmons: maybe its the cable that connects your monitor to the dispaly port into graphics card

[0:12:51] Ficusonishe: #ad LULW
[0:12:51] ShilezhiNipi: it's a hardware issue, check your GPU tempature
[0:12:51] Wesker889: Mullvad VPN
[0:12:51] rvft1: i cant see how a vpn could work but im dumb
[0:12:51] 42arc: looks like NoPixel connection needs whitelisted in router, or ports opened
[0:12:53] silvercodek: no way it is due to connection issue otherwise similar thing would happen during storm when server resets
[0:12:55] luis_king82: NordVpn.. is the best for this
[0:12:55] SupportYourLocalLurker: mullvad is cheap and fast

[0:13:06] LokiTheElusive: @NoraExplorer Nord has a free trial so you can test it
[0:13:06] Jersey_Justin: might be able to do a free trial first
[0:13:07] nibustan: Don't check browser history
[0:13:10] DragonMatt81: I'm convinced it is something on Nunu. Scuffed item or clothing
[0:13:10] AKCNT: On the other servers the problem still occurs or it's nopixel problem only?
[0:13:10] drippyRoo: get trial first
[0:13:10] arcane2114: A bad connection doesn't make you stutter like that.
[0:13:12] DexRuffin: Is it working for SELMA on her setup?

[0:13:24] peterx_14: Nord is good

[0:13:26] RavagedPistol: vpn are fairly cheap

[0:13:29] Puupeetzz: @nibustan DUUUUD
[0:13:33] houstontexas936: So you didn't get a npc when you had a sponsor by them
[0:13:33] fireflowergoddess: I use PIA
[0:13:34] Black_Griffin: chat surely if it was the cable, she;d have streaming issues but shes not
[0:13:35] LokiTheElusive: @arcane2114 Packet loss can definitely do that
[0:13:36] Heenkaa: Try a new cable, then VPN
[0:13:38] JustAboveYou: Ethernet cable could be dmg  but if after the VPN don't work i wouldd suggest a new cord
[0:13:38] SupportYourLocalLurker: I really don’t think vpn will make a difference
[0:13:39] broxx909: Check if ethernet is fully plugged in
[0:13:39] bluff1n: it's worth a shot you never know
[0:13:41] 5CookieMonster5: Nah you got no frame drop, your internet look fine. If you doubt try "Speedtest" on google to test it (dont show your IP tho)
[0:13:42] 42arc: it was glitching on Rust too, so has to be cable i guess
[0:13:44] napkin4872: Why dont just try playing GTA offline, not off stream, but the normal offline gta @NoraExplorer
[0:13:45] jelezsoccer: @DragonMatt81 This makes most sense to me.
[0:13:46] drokoh: mullvad is based in your area and best for security
[0:13:46] noezx: Worth a try to VPN
[0:13:47] TTUCROWN: Go to a command prompt and set a continuous ping to google to see if you drop packets.
[0:13:49] ehhazzy: @sk23podnl2 yep I understand but that's why I'm asking if she's still running DDR4
[0:13:49] korolyov94: Hello Nora

[0:20:51] rocfella: @NoraExplorer it may be a problem with your DNS provider at first I would try to change DNS to google or cloudflare, if that doesn't help I would call your ISP, when I had this problem my ISP had problems with AWS servers (nopixel has AWS hosting) Hmm
[0:20:52] LokiTheElusive: try a closer region for your VPN it'll be easier on stream @NoraExplorer
[0:20:54] noezx: it’s actually getting better

[0:21:17] blackmaiden: @chat did she do a temp check?
[0:21:19] Kryorgin: what happened to the murks guy I though he fixed your issue ? @NoraExplorer
