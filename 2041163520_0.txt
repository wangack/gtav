[2:23:01] reesespieces17: Their are quotes from the band as of Jan 4 that they will not be on tour again
[2:23:03] ShtickInABox: @bizzleschwizzle Interesting, I wonder who they could bring in that could match Zach energy and vocals...like I SAW Prophets of Rage back in like 2016 or 2017 at Riot Fest, and they were solid but no where near the same.
[2:23:14] JBeardoh: audioslave without Cornell

[2:27:10] ShtickInABox: The problem with what you're seeing with certain artists is that they have to consistently tour, dropping records and signing label deals isn't a ticket to being able to make enough money to STOP doing it.
[2:27:15] reesespieces17: According to the statement that de la Rocha posted when he left Rage Against the Machine in 2000, "I feel that it is now necessary to leave Rage because our decision-making process has completely failed. It is no longer meeting the aspirations of all four of us collectively as a band, and from my perspective, has undermined our artistic and political ideal."

[2:28:53] ShtickInABox: Having spent about 15+ years in the music industry and working with a wide range of artists from indie to national touring bands, you see different "power structures" and cliques develop between bands that have more than 2 people
[2:29:05] reesespieces17: The article went on to talk about the stunts that they would produce being so dangerous.

[3:31:22] Zechss_: @Christian2920 I only woke up few hours ago
[3:31:26] HiimMoos3: @Zechss_ Heard that. All of my buddies are like "BRO WE JUST GRIND CATCH" I'm over here enjoying the greenery
[3:31:28] Stealthkillah122: Christian uhsLove

[3:31:50] Zechss_: nintendo aint happy
[3:31:52] MiniBerger_: it's "survival"
[3:31:56] im_d0ugii: it definitely has survival aspects
[3:32:00] Emaykurrz_: Of course nintendos not happy
[3:32:01] Prollos: over 4 millions sales too, if they flesh it out a little more it'll be a great game
[3:32:03] HiimMoos3: Feel like they would have slapped it in production.
[3:32:04] Zechss_: nintendo released a siese and desist
[3:32:08] Comis19: yeah Nintendo going to go after them.
[3:32:08] Christian2920: Nintendo aint happy about the Pokemon mod people made
[3:32:09] Zechss_: i cannot spell
[3:32:13] Vorrant: their lawyers will do the talking
[3:32:16] Zechss_: YEP
[3:32:16] ianakaBoogie: oop
[3:32:16] kerndeezy: BLUBBERS
[3:32:18] im_d0ugii: of course Nintendo is going to be upset, but they have no room to stand on
[3:32:18] Leebsz: KEKW
[3:32:22] Firstnecron: KEKW
[3:32:22] Prollos: thats probably the pokemon mod for it
[3:32:24] Christian2920: Thats for the actual pokemon mod though no?
[3:32:25] lRevl: It was about a mod guys chill.
[3:32:28] Zechss_: airborne told me
[3:32:30] NukeTheJukebox: that's for the mod not the game
[3:32:33] BabaJuice: im out of the loop... what game?
[3:32:34] StreamElements: Yo!  Don't like ads?  Don't feel like being a gigachad and subbing? Twitch Turbo is for you!  https://www.twitch.tv/turbo
[3:32:35] Kliner69er: I think that's only on the Pokemon mod for it.
[3:32:37] CreedOnLive: for the pokemon mod, not the base game
[3:32:39] BluGiant: Also on IGN  "Palworld Devs Says They Have Received Death Threats Amid Pokémon 'Rip-Off' Claims"
[3:32:42] Emaykurrz_: Ffs Zechs
[3:32:42] Leebsz: ok cool
[3:32:45] Roaminghydra: Nintendo has already tried to sue many times
[3:32:48] Emaykurrz_: Dont scare us like that
[3:32:51] xtorgex: it’ll be protected under parody law @uhsnow
[3:32:55] educated_monkey: @BluGiant wild right?
[3:32:59] im_d0ugii: Nintendo WILL sue and Pokemon modders, but not Palworld
[3:33:03] Zechss_: OH... THANK GOD
[3:33:04] im_d0ugii: any*
[3:33:05] BluGiant: @BluGiant NODDERS
[3:33:11] Zechss_: good news
[3:33:15] kerndeezy: SAVED for now
[3:33:20] xEvila: OMEGALAUGHING
[3:33:31] BluGiant: Its sold 5m copies in three days
[3:33:34] MotherGoose6587: People are mistaking Nintendo shutting down the Pokemon Mods that are already out.  Thats where all the articles of the nintendo lawsuits came form.
[3:33:34] StreamElements: There are bots currently going around Twitch whispering you about giveaways. These giveaways are a scam. DO NOT CLICK ANYTHING, just report them to Twitch and block them!
[3:33:34] Zechss_: yeeeh i mean theres 2 companys you dont fuck with
[3:33:34] BluGiant: LUL
[3:33:37] Zechss_: nintendo and disney
[3:33:42] Zechss_: THEY COME AFTER EVERTONE
[3:33:44] bulletmonkey85: Palworld already bigger launch then Cyberpunk and Elden Ring
[3:33:48] im_d0ugii: its like Pokemon and Ark made a baby
[3:33:52] Zechss_: no i mean..
[3:33:53] SnowLae: @xtorgex no, its a distinct copyright because it hasn't ripped assets or designs. Parody has nothing to do with it. People who keep saying it'll get shut down have no idea what they are talking about
[3:34:00] kerndeezy: because theyre thinking "why didnt we think of this" KEKW
[3:34:04] StreamElements: The new merch is here PogChamp Check it out: https://merch.streamelements.com/uhsnow
[3:34:04] Christian2920: Its got the 2nd highest concurrent player count on Steam KEKW
[3:34:06] Emaykurrz_: No disney just own a fuck ton of things
[3:34:06] Zechss_: with copywrite disney and ninetendo will sue everyone, you dont fuck with them
[3:34:09] educated_monkey: @SnowLae this
[3:34:37] im_d0ugii: The guns would probably save Palworld in court to be honest
[3:34:38] CreedOnLive: their next game looks incredibly similar to hollow knight
[3:34:52] Prollos: @uhSnow they're fine, this has existing for years KEKW https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GEVRebyXoAABpOQ?format=jpg
[3:34:54] Xantcha_: The biggest allegation rn is that they may be using AI assisted tools due to past history with AI due to models being almost 1 to 1 to other pokemon
[3:34:54] Zechss_: oh yeh, ninetendo if they win will legit destroy that company and game
[3:34:55] lulzification: I feel like this company was founded on the belief of 'Poke the Nintendo bear as much as we can' KEKW
[3:34:56] Zechss_: its done
[3:35:06] xtorgex: @snowlae i didn’t say it’ll get shut down im saying it’s protected?
[3:35:10] kirkis123: Some of the sounds of pal word remind me of botw/totk like when you discover a new location
[3:35:23] im_d0ugii: because theyve given pokemon guns to use as theyre like "ultimate"
[3:35:23] AnnoyinMercenary: It's not a matter of if they'd win in court, but that they may not be able to afford to fight back
[3:35:26] Christian2920: KEKW
[3:35:32] Prollos: they dont own the right to monster catching as a genre KEKW
[3:35:42] Zechss_: but yeh snow.. i been rping like 10-12 hours a day
[3:35:45] Zechss_: I am fuckin hooooked
[3:35:50] BluGiant: "Palworld Overtakes Counter-Strike to Become the Second Most-Played Game Ever on Steam"
[3:35:52] Zechss_: I need an intervention
[3:36:10] Stealthkillah122: @zechss_  just stop being a booner
[3:36:15] Christian2920: I mean Si has some good shit going for him
[3:36:15] Stealthkillah122: Boomer*
[3:36:24] kerndeezy: @Stealthkillah122 you're a booner Madge
[3:36:31] EmrysorMerlin: Also driving lessons Zechss uhsKEKW
[3:36:31] Zechss_: @Stealthkillah122 dude depression and anxiety are the biggest issue, just gettin mentally drained
[3:36:36] SnowLae: @xtorgex protected is not the right word you want to use. It's not "protected", it's allowed to exist because its original IP. You wouldn't say that a new hamburger restaurant is "protected" against mcdonalds
[3:36:39] Stealthkillah122: @kerndeezy  D:
[3:36:39] StreamElements: D:
[3:36:43] Zechss_: @Christian2920 man the rp has beeen AMAZING

[3:37:32] Zechss_: NO IM POOR AS SHIT
[3:37:36] Zechss_: I have a blue yeti
[3:37:41] Stealthkillah122: Just download more money
[3:37:41] xtorgex: @snowlae I’m using it in a layman’s terminology
[3:37:51] Christian2920: lmfao
[3:37:56] Vorrant: gain +10
[3:37:58] Zechss_: cause mic you use needs a go xlr etc
[3:38:02] Zechss_: cause its an xlr lead
[3:38:04] StreamElements: PLEASE DO NOT BACKSEAT COP/GAME! Snow is playing the game and he doesn't need your help! There is plenty of other things to talk about in chat :)
[3:38:04] ShtickInABox: Blue Yeti's are mostly reasonable if you can find a good sale/deal
[3:38:08] ShtickInABox: Mine only cost $89.99
[3:38:15] J0hanAndersson: THIS ?
[3:38:17] NukeTheJukebox: AT2020 XLR is what youre using lol
[3:38:20] Zechss_: i have some vocal mics from singing
[3:38:27] Zechss_: but there all xlr leads, so need a mixer
[3:38:33] Zechss_: which costs like 500 pounbds plus
[3:38:34] StreamElements: The new merch is here PogChamp Check it out: https://merch.streamelements.com/uhsnow
[3:38:34] SnowLae: Literally the only interactions Nintendo has with Palworld at this point is they are taking down mods that change everything to actual Pokemon, nothing to do with the actual game itself or the dev/publisher
[3:38:37] NukeTheJukebox: LOL
[3:38:51] Zechss_: yeh usb
[3:39:00] im_d0ugii: 82lbs?!!?!?!
[3:39:05] Zechss_: YOU
[3:39:08] Zechss_: FUCKINN LEGEND
[3:39:12] Christian2920: Yes, its lined with lead im_d0ugii

[3:39:32] Savage_Roo: What I payed $200 for my Rod NO! lol
[3:39:33] Zechss_: like it drops fps out the ass, and if i stream at same time o7
[3:39:35] MiniBerger_: I love my AT2020 USB
[3:39:42] Zechss_: just cpu and ram are trash
[3:39:54] Firstnecron: @Zechss_ are you using gpu encoder?
[3:40:03] Zechss_: @Firstnecron wtf is that
[3:40:03] Prollos: the fact they've sold over 4 million copies should light the fire under gamefreaks / nintendos ass to actually make a competent pokemon game in a similar fashion, swallow the pride and push it to PC and make it an mmo, people would happily pay a subscription LUL
[3:40:03] xExoGamingFTWx: I have a shure MV7 and I love it
[3:40:10] Firstnecron: @Zechss_ what GPU do you have?
[3:40:12] Christian2920: The AT2020 is amazing
[3:40:18] Zechss_: @Firstnecron 3070 ti
[3:40:18] Stealthkillah122: But but more expensive means better right ? Kappa
[3:40:22] Vorrant: but neumanns are cool
[3:40:24] ShtickInABox: I was gonna say if you're gonna get something worthwhile...take a look at Shure's line of microphones...
[3:40:25] Xantcha_: Do you have affordable mic recommendations?
[3:40:28] Firstnecron: @Zechss_ Make sure you are using NVENC
[3:40:28] Zechss_: cpu/ram
[3:40:29] ShtickInABox: Shure is top quality
[3:40:31] Nohbob: Do you run yours through a goxlr?
[3:40:31] SlightlyAwkward: What software do you suggest?
[3:40:42] Zechss_: @Firstnecron whats that ?
[3:40:47] IronicViking: I got a shire mv7 for 180e works great and has both usb and xlr
[3:40:47] Prollos: malware from all the boomer ads hes clicked Kappa
[3:40:48] StreamElements: Ads support this stream massively, sorry if ads popped up at the wrong moment. But you could always subscribe or get Twitch Turbo to avoid getting ads!
[3:40:52] ShtickInABox: That's also a fair point @uhSnow
[3:40:54] Zechss_: so i have a 10400f i5 cpu and 16 gb ram
[3:40:54] Firstnecron: @Zechss_ What streaming software are you using?
[3:40:56] Zechss_: sooooo
[3:40:59] AntoNoobHD: @Prollos can't really see them shipping it on pc since nintendo owns part of game freak
[3:41:04] Vorrant: shure has a cheaper version of the SM7b the MV7
[3:41:09] Zechss_: well i get fps drop even if not streamin
[3:41:10] Firstnecron: Not AV1
[3:41:11] IronicViking: FINALLY
[3:41:17] ItsJustDip: Fifine Mics are the future so so good for the price of them
[3:41:17] Firstnecron: Just multi-encoding atm
[3:41:18] Zechss_: @Firstnecron streamlabs
[3:41:29] Firstnecron: AV1 is a future thing
[3:41:35] Zechss_: but then as said main times snow, i stream when i cba and for fun you know
[3:41:40] Zechss_: sooo not really looked into much of it
[3:41:45] J0hanAndersson: SNS buns POGGIES
[3:41:45] xExoGamingFTWx: I read it as AV1 as well
[3:42:00] Zechss_: chrisitans just sayin its quiet
[3:42:10] xExoGamingFTWx: LUL
[3:42:12] Zechss_: but i want a new one anyways, this blue yeti picks up EVERYTHING
[3:42:20] Firstnecron: From my understanding its just multi-encoding for now, but AV1 is something we'll introduce into that beta in the future
[3:42:30] xExoGamingFTWx: leakers
[3:42:31] Nohbob: I love chill Fury/Snow days.
[3:42:32] Vorrant: @Zechss_ OBS has a gate plugin
[3:42:37] Zechss_: i run it through voice meter banana
[3:42:47] Zechss_: @Vorrant have all that set up aswell
[3:43:01] xExoGamingFTWx: I hate voicemeter
[3:43:07] Savage_Roo: The rod USB is just plug and play
[3:43:12] Zechss_: well sometime when your not streaming, i will have to get you to sit in a vc with me
[3:43:15] Zechss_: and help me set some shit up
[3:43:15] ItsJustDip: Elgato Wave is good
[3:43:23] ZaffreBlaze: There’s enough streamer facing hardware for mic processing at this point that no one should have to use Voicemeeter anymore. It’s a PITA
[3:43:26] ZodikaGames: Steelseries have a software to split audio if needed, havent looked into it yet though
[3:43:27] bigmanbigsam: wher in UK u from big man?
[3:43:33] Prollos: need a ziggy rag™ all audio issues are gone then KEKW

[3:43:53] ReeceWithAC: erryone and their mums is packing round ere
[3:43:54] Zechss_: i used to jsut get high
[3:43:57] Firstnecron: with an i5 you want to offload as much CPU load as you can so it can focus on just running the game
[3:43:59] Zechss_: and let my drummer and guitarist do it
[3:44:01] Zechss_: D
[3:44:02] Zechss_: XD
[3:44:04] Vorrant: you sound great
[3:44:05] xtorgex: @snowlae so is Nintendo going after the modded then?
[3:44:07] Christian2920: And a Kiwo brand Premium Mic Stand Prollos That part is essential
[3:44:10] collisiondomain_: Sounds check good, no bg stuff

[3:44:13] xExoGamingFTWx: Nope
[3:44:13] ZaffreBlaze: Yeah you’ve always pretty much been radio quality
[3:44:15] Zechss_: @Firstnecron so how do i do this?

[3:44:39] Christian2920: Its fucking hilarious
[3:44:45] Firstnecron: @Zechss_ Settings -> Output -> Encoder (under streaming) should be set to NVIDIA NVENC H.264 (new)
[3:44:46] BluGiant: DESKCHAN definetly LUL
