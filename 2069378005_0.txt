[1:14:45] heat31: OOC they get it, but in game the Captains are taking the 1 lifer situation much more seriously. At least 5 daps for Excessive force, could lead up to murder
[1:14:49] DanLGG: he is getting in trouble for the 1 bullet for Baas because he used excessive force and wanted to make sure he was dead lol
[1:14:49] Acidplox37: Aren't you a cop? Whats happened lol

[4:15:52] d_o_g_o_: i think they know they cant afford to lose any officers especially efficient ones
[4:15:53] bardoctor17: @kelborn slacks not gonna let anything happen to cornwood lol
[4:15:54] SpiritEX: EZ fired? Ben Zel Shiesty coming in hot
[4:15:54] azncheesy: Aziz will Riot if Denzel quits
[4:15:56] SQUIIlD: is it over u think?
[4:15:56] LeakDaTV: Cornwood
[4:15:59] silvercodek: are you gonna play dean as civ if it's gg
[4:15:59] not_rahk: @Athasin AINTNOWAY
[4:16:01] Athasin: @misteren3rgy It won't be Ruth that's for sure
[4:16:08] Kelborn: @slymox I agree, plus Ruth may pursue a Murder charge against Cornwood, I think most of the officers would freak over all this
[4:16:11] GeeMcTee: i know you want the o7, but termination does have potential to have good RP
[4:16:11] AUXY_1: Yeah there is no way you get fired I don't believe it. A lot of people in the pd already thinks it's bullshit what has happened. It would genuinely probably create a schism
[4:16:11] louaai_22: what if you make another character
[4:16:17] torty1987: did any1 see the clip of aziz in the mirror that was sooo funny
[4:16:19] bahubaker: you should do a lawyer arc
[4:16:22] GlitchyByte: we have captain dap and captain ineffective, not much hope
[4:16:22] pukanacua: GotDapped
[4:16:23] Jersey_Justin: damn
[4:16:28] SQUIIlD: tufffff
[4:16:28] SpiritEX: then make a Ben zel char EZ
[4:16:29] devlin0221: Cornwood will safe you

[4:16:32] slymox: @Kelborn yeah, exactly
[4:16:32] randybobndyphone: Liberal snow flake pd
[4:16:35] MRWOBBL3: I think slacks said turner was going to hop on for a bit today
[4:16:36] Xierany: If they fire you I lose all faith in the Captains. Ruth is consistent but Slacks has fallen hard
[4:16:36] RichHomieRicardo: have you heard from any of them?
[4:16:39] MRWOBBL3: could be wrong though
[4:16:41] chmod_R_777: maybe ONX is the play for cops
[4:16:42] antreids: But what did you do for it to be that hopeless?
[4:16:45] alekxx__: cornwood and mcnulty Prayge
[4:16:47] SarahFlare: there’s no way it’s over.
[4:16:48] IanDooleyTV: Captains shouldn't be making the decision. High Command/State should. Seems weird that the people giving out the DAPS also get to decide if you get to continue having fun in a video game or not
[4:16:48] FvmousAce_: gonna have to lick some boots for ya job back?
[4:16:49] Athasin: @not_rahk https://www.twitch.tv/deansocool/clip/HandsomeDirtyMinkImGlitch-9mxLSxh8XjlPE0e6

[4:17:00] DanLGG: I think you’ll get demoted but not fired.
[4:17:03] GeeMcTee: ex-PD gang
[4:17:06] FwOgUiN2: i really enjoy your co pov
[4:17:06] Athasin: Slack's decision btw, Ruth was just giving the bad news
[4:17:11] devlin0221: @IanDooleyTV I agree with you on that one. It's stupid. The captains should have a boss.
[4:17:15] FwOgUiN2: hold firm brotherrrr
[4:17:16] Athasin: @not_rahk
[4:17:23] FwOgUiN2: you can bat the case
[4:17:30] Jersey_Justin: Can the mayor help maybe?
[4:17:30] IanDooleyTV: @devlin0221 Or something. Just anything above them so they arent completely in control of the RP.
[4:17:34] FvmousAce_: ask for desk duty
[4:17:39] FwOgUiN2: beat*
[4:17:43] slymox: Bike-Cop Dean
[4:17:43] not_rahk: @Athasin ofc it's Ruth

[4:17:53] mufc9905: Will you still play Denzel if he gets fired
[4:17:55] GeeMcTee: ask for Jail duty

[4:18:00] xypher85: BEGGING
[4:18:02] Velehoh: Snr. buns security duty for a week Aware
[4:18:04] YEP46: Prayge become a preacher denzel
[4:18:07] warner05: Well that's promising.
[4:18:09] Jersey_Justin: yea, this server would lose out on such a good cop
[4:18:10] mufc9905: month on dispatch?
[4:18:11] SpiritEX: @Velehoh omE

[4:18:39] SpiritEX: Ramee up before meeting omE
[4:18:43] johnddollas: y’all think cornwood is gone?
[4:18:43] Athasin: @not_rahk Nah it was Slacks, she was just the messenger because Jackson told her it was kinda messed. up to let him work a shift/write reports knowing he's gonna get suspended
[4:18:44] Kelborn: Ruth doesnt care about losing officers apparently, she just wants to police the police harder than anyone
[4:18:49] GeorgieDesign: PD need an IA dept
[4:18:55] Momo23: illegal pass. +1 DAP
[4:19:04] OiAM_Paka: daaaaamn
[4:19:05] DanLGG: It ain’t kings don’t beg. Even Kings need humbled.

[4:19:21] AndreSays: Esfand about to rain terror if he gets in trouble
[4:19:26] slymox: The Bush shooting
[4:19:27] BigglesVII: Wouldnt be suprised if Ruth wants him out of the way for the Sheriffs job lol
[4:19:27] riiftzzz: surely ooc there has to be a discussion about him knowing it was your one lifer
[4:19:29] bardoctor17: @johnddollas what happened with cletus??

[4:19:29] mufc9905: What happened with cornwood?
[4:19:30] h0lk1: if they fire cornwood the pd is doomed lol
[4:19:32] Xierany: If Cornwood is gone, then PD is fucked. He does so much, and getting fired to SBS would be really bad
[4:19:34] misteren3rgy: Lord Admiral Crane shall step in
[4:19:34] theemarshmallowman: What happened to cornwood?

[4:20:08] slymox: imagine Cornwood and Den go down at once, that's crazy
[4:20:09] torty1987: @Athasin oh ffs its as if there trying to get all the people out who are actualy good cop rpers its a joke
[4:20:10] Kelborn: it sounds like something we are making up because its so stupid, but yeah, thats the truth

[4:24:53] Athasin: @riiftzzz Exactly
[4:24:54] AndreSays: @SpiritEX i've been watching less cop streams because of it
[4:24:57] Kelborn: @Deansocool What is funny is IRL you would never have been punished for that, you were acting within the scope of your duties. You may have been sued by johnson though, max. (From someone who was a deputy IRL)
[4:25:01] ramsin50: only the 4 snow grey daps were deserved
[4:25:02] galidorn269: @Athasin Lenny has also received daps from pitting too
[4:25:03] Downbag: The first firing happened already, don't worry, even Ruth doesn't want to part with you
[4:25:05] AndreSays: effectively they make cop streams more predictable
[4:25:10] alanmc30: when do you find out?
[4:25:17] mufc9905: @riiftzzz What were those for?
[4:25:19] fatguy27: time on shift makes sense for daps going away since people who play more or at risk
[4:25:28] FvmousAce_: cry a little make it a show
[4:25:29] quinnntino: @galidorn269 he didn't get a DAP, he got to choose between a dap or 30min trash picking and he picked the 2nd
[4:25:34] lallii123: PD RP started off as the best RP until the daps started rolling in and now its just shit to watch
[4:25:40] quinnntino: @galidorn269 and didn't do the trash picking LULW
[4:25:41] MDM4ever1986HD: I think the only cop streams I watch are Dean, Cornwood and Snow
[4:25:42] Athasin: @galidorn269 Didn't he get a choice just last night between garbage duty and getting a dap for that pit?
[4:25:43] Xierany: @Kelborn 100% .. McNulty defending Shiesty saying it was a solid pit, but Slacks is on something
[4:25:49] BDG_parth28: Exactly it's a game , no need to be that tryhard
[4:25:56] Skycoh: what mos?
[4:25:58] Kelborn: @Deansocool I understand but theyre punishing you becaause theyre trying to make it realistic, but its not realistic in any way
[4:25:59] MDM4ever1986HD: it's only a game chill
[4:26:00] Mr_Dirty_Bag: is this a lrp
[4:26:00] BDG_parth28: Have some fun

[4:26:17] AndreSays: I hate the mentality of "well someone needs to take responsibilty for what happened"
[4:26:20] zfalcorz: the M4 certs hurt my soul
[4:26:23] AndreSays: and legit Aziz took responsibility
[4:26:29] nickdrawsstuff: thats the thing, RP needs to come first --- RP before SoPs, just keep it within reason
[4:26:29] MDM4ever1986HD: hate the character not the streamer 100%
[4:26:30] AJorAJAYY: Lets do a prediction for if Denzel is getting fired

[4:26:35] Skycoh: 915B, Automotive Maintenance, logistics officer
[4:26:36] vonderweisz: @Kelborn what is that?
[4:26:40] nickdrawsstuff: at the end of the day its an RP server
[4:26:43] Xierany: Worse than PD punishing people is being inconsistent, like did you see Lenny escape DAPs for his ocean dumb pit?
[4:26:46] Valkner12: @ajorajayy Nahhhhh
[4:26:48] h0lk1: sure but daps ruin a lot of fun, sure they have uses but wtf man, it's the good rp cops that gets shit on imo
[4:26:52] bertacharm: the only thing is didnt like was slacks basically sayin we getting sued so you getting dapped
[4:26:53] Kelborn: @vonderweisz motor transport

[4:27:36] onlyicxrus: hell yeeah
[4:27:41] Skycoh: saab plays that role very well. so goood
[4:27:42] MDM4ever1986HD: @moistf1ngers Yep I've never had plaice in a long time
[4:27:47] FvmousAce_: G6 not as fun as PD? LUL
[4:27:50] Kelborn: @vonderweisz not a mech, a driver, mech a different occ field
[4:27:52] BDG_parth28: OMG zaddy xypher with W flipsssssss
[4:27:53] xoshannon: is there any word on you going back to pd?
[4:27:53] zomgeo: I struggled to like ruth at first but I feel like her character is set up to have so many good arcs now
[4:27:55] loveandsupply: slacks tired too hard and is making PD weird
[4:27:56] Stinfeket: Captain Slacks is a bit naive
[4:27:56] BDG_parth28: WWWWWWWWWWW
[4:27:59] Xierany: Imo Slacks shouldn't be above Sergeant, he's not good to be in high command
[4:28:00] bertacharm: Athasin, esfand was sayin den is like a beta tester for sop's peepoGiggle
[4:28:02] red_eyed_jed1: 3 times in a row all in and lost FeelsRainMan
[4:28:04] louaai_22: thats what i wanted to say, this is a video game and you can make multi charecters and one life them as much as you want and you may know the actual player and joke with him somehow @Deansocool
[4:28:06] TacticalFuzz: Is Cpt; Turner still around? Ive not caught a stream in a while...
[4:28:07] Bigeyez: Definitely don't hate the streamers but Cheever straight up said she puts immersion above all else yesterday and for a content server I think that's a bad mentality
[4:28:12] TimmayHS: Slacks likes to say stuff that sounds like it should have some meaning or insight, but it's like multiple platitudes glued together.
[4:28:16] chmod_R_777: the Police problem could be a Server Philosophy problem... in that case Admins are responsible for the mess, 60 DAPs, rules, etc
[4:28:18] AndreSays: @Stinfeket he speaks in cliche's. he 100% is LUL
[4:28:22] vonderweisz: @Kelborn oh youre just the driveer so thatd be our 88M
[4:28:35] slymox: Don't forget the crims!
[4:28:38] Athasin: @Athasin And what's even worse, Lenny put someone into water and watched her drown. Meanwhile Denzel put a car and that car hit a person. Denzel wasn't even a direct hit.
[4:28:38] MokuZz_: holy
[4:28:43] MDM4ever1986HD: @Bigeyez she even says herself her character is a bitch but chat hoppers don't see that
[4:28:44] MokuZz_: Chatting
[4:28:51] Athasin: @bertacharm Yeah he's the SOP guinea pig
[4:29:02] h0lk1: so are you going to austin soon
[4:29:05] Kelborn: @vonderweisz yeah basically, but we also qualified on machine guns because of our mission, which is typical for logistics units during that time
[4:29:08] loveandsupply: slacks gives off hater vibes. he’s been cockblocking Cornwoods idea for sheriffs office
[4:29:09] Villenthessis: omE
[4:29:23] Athasin: Wait, has Dean seen the roof hack update?
[4:29:39] AndreSays: Cornwoood owning slacks the other day about getting shit done was Classicc
[4:29:41] slymox: @loveandsupply He's like permanently devil's advocate
[4:29:49] Bigeyez: @mdm4ever1986hd yeah I know. Cheever is cool and all that. I just think she is rping her character in a way that hurts the server because at the end of the day nopixel is about the content. It's not a super serious thing
[4:29:53] Kelborn: @loveandsupply was it slacks removing all the blaine county tags from reports?
[4:29:58] Kerviel_: @loveandsupply yeah, been that way forever. RIP Andrews, Pred, Toretti, Smith, etc
[4:30:04] Bigeyez: The cops are chasing clown gangs and sewer people you know
[4:30:07] Kelborn: @Bigeyez I agree
[4:30:20] BigglesVII: @Kelborn No one knows
[4:30:25] AndreSays: @Kelborn slacks did change cornwoods status to Los Santos because that's where he works
[4:30:31] Kelborn: @BigglesVII someone knows
[4:30:34] MDM4ever1986HD: @Bigeyez yeah 100% I hate her character but I wouldn't go into her stream when she does and call her names it's RP at the end of the day
[4:30:35] BYOSHOCK: i love your alien antennas
[4:30:36] vonderweisz: @Kelborn I mean yeah thats just basic soldiering tho comes with the territory
[4:30:36] AndreSays: but not the report tags
[4:30:38] Athasin: Dude the black suit, black mask, purple eye with a knife out looks fire
[4:30:38] Ard______: !watchtime
[4:30:42] MDM4ever1986HD: I roll with the RP
[4:30:50] onlyicxrus: @AndreSays that's a joke between them that they both are aware of
[4:30:52] RawerPower: you getting no updates even thou you top 3 snitches Eugene , Marty and 4head
[4:30:53] Kelborn: @AndreSays I know that but Im talking all the blaine county reports
[4:30:57] hrki9: Has there been any update on Den
[4:31:05] BDG_parth28: Elo is the GOAT
[4:31:07] RawerPower: meet*
[4:31:14] louaai_22: do you have to be a streamer to get whitelisted in the server? @Deansocool
[4:31:15] Superhank: need to get that g6 drip

[4:31:43] Smalls3122: @Deansocool if den gets fired and cornwood suspended it would kill the PD
[4:31:45] dynasty_eth: Is dean suspended or coming back to the PD?
[4:31:45] slymox: LUL Fashion Police gonna come for you
[4:31:46] Irry_: Denzel needs new drip what you mean KEKW
[4:31:47] tyler__96: Have you thought about how you are going to act if you get fired?
[4:31:47] AndreSays: @Kelborn yea true because that other cop brought it up as an issue as well
[4:31:47] MDM4ever1986HD: so you will keep Denzel or you 100% going to perma him in a way that's meaningful?
[4:31:48] vaipesz: looks like Team Fortress 2 Assassin
[4:32:03] AndreSays: if it ends up being Ruth I will laugh
[4:32:03] Kelborn: @Deansocool PS I saw that AP, I have a watch trading business if you ever lookin for a piece
[4:32:06] BDG_parth28: NGL I always prefer crim dean over denzel or den , maybe cuz Im here because of den quincy
[4:32:13] Stinfeket: Why would you?

[4:32:30] misteren3rgy: Believe
[4:32:33] Xierany: I think you lose more cops if Den and Cornwood goes, a lost of trust lost in the PD from Officers
[4:32:33] SpiritEX: @dynasty_eth PepeLaugh  hes coming to pd today to leave for 30 days
[4:32:36] sm0kingjs: what did dean do wrong anyone????
[4:32:39] Superhank: what if they demote you to report writer omE
[4:32:45] angus1794: yo you killed it at the streamer awards

[4:33:04] younghof27: as a viewer 3.0 was best. Ruth is a boring character lol
[4:33:05] Kelborn: @sm0kingjs denzel was doing his job correctly so he got dapped
[4:33:06] Stinfeket: You 100% took all the corrections to heart with every DAP, they must have noticed that. =)
[4:33:11] flamingacegibbo: why slacks and Ruth so awful at being captains ? they have no people management skills what so ever lol

[4:33:54] MDM4ever1986HD: FFS Eugene
[4:33:55] loveandsupply: not to stay on this topic, but there needs to be a way to perma slacks. and watch RP as whole improve. His bad decisions and want to be the main character ruins good RP
[4:33:57] h0yMinoy: had a lil cop instinct right there
[4:34:03] sm0kingjs: @Kelborn so what do they accuse him of doing
[4:34:03] Sympathizee: Fair enough tho crim is sleeper as f
[4:34:05] MDM4ever1986HD: @ramsin50 hopefully later
[4:34:16] RexPappa: I think you should get it back, cuz Den Zel was the guinea pig for how DAPs should work

[4:34:24] Athasin: @Sympathizee It is when you're solo
[4:34:29] mad0monk: How you feel about them probably giving Cornwood a bunch of daps today for shooting your one life character?
[4:34:29] Kelborn: @sm0kingjs violating SOP with an unsafe pit where a civ was struck
[4:34:35] MDM4ever1986HD: lookUp
[4:34:39] Superhank: if you dont get fired what happens to the 10? or dont know yet?
[4:34:44] MDM4ever1986HD: @kyleisok33 really?
[4:34:44] jesscdcc: modCheck
[4:34:47] DanLGG: They let Lenny do sanitation over a dap for his pit into the water. I think Slacks will work something out.
[4:34:48] MDM4ever1986HD: modCheck
[4:34:54] Kelborn: but it wasnt against SOP, its a long winded story and been beat to death at this point @sm0kingjs
[4:34:56] BDG_parth28: @kyleisok33  u will get banned for rdm deansoBozo
[4:34:57] sm0kingjs: @Kelborn ah when johnson got run over
[4:34:57] TheLadyCupcake: resurrect him PogU
[4:35:01] Tazmandvl: Would it be worth snitching on guys like that to build extra favor with the RP
[4:35:01] mad0monk: I don't think you should feel bad, captains be trippin
[4:35:12] Mardomus: Corn is done. Sad to say but Ruth want ya both gone
[4:35:16] Athasin: That wasn't on you, it's on the cops that snitched for no reason.
[4:35:19] AndreSays: @loveandsupply I disagree with some of this. He definitely helps to push other RP but him and Ruth don't seem to care about enabling good/fun RP within the PD
[4:35:21] devlin0221: THere should be a PD stricke
[4:35:22] Kelborn: Shouldnt feel bad, it was entertaining RP for everyone involved until Ruth got her hands on the matter
[4:35:25] itsyaboynathan75hd: deansoBozo

[6:40:10] DaiKi_gg: could he not do something or help out
[6:40:15] Claxman2000: if they fire you, they are finished being captains
[6:40:16] sledgejustsold: see
[6:40:16] MDM4ever1986HD: I believe he'll keep his job
[6:40:22] DanLGG: Bro Nekodda would be a W advocate
[6:40:23] sterred: @wolfgang_86 Why would he?
[6:40:24] mavericks312: if they fire you after the mayor went ape shot on them every captain would be fired lol
[6:40:24] MDM4ever1986HD: @Claxman2000 100%
[6:40:25] sledgejustsold: nah man
[6:40:29] Kaisenjin: Cornwood and Mayor are going after the PD ass if you get fired

[6:41:15] m4l1kkk: No-one can influence the Captains decisions deansoShy
[6:41:15] wolfgang_86: @sterred he is pissed about pd not getting better or having more cops etc hearing they fired some will prolly make him mad
[6:41:26] mavericks312: Lenny legit watched a man drown after a pit and didn’t gen get a dap
[6:41:26] Thraxton1: And lenny pit one guy at 110 and another into the water and had to clean trash for 30 min LUL
[6:41:38] TimmayHS: PD Union is 100% needed imo
[6:41:39] JsLeos: PD too afraid to do their jobs omE
[6:41:39] Athasin: "Someone else take primary. I have too many DAPs"
[6:41:43] sterred: @wolfgang_86 ah OK... Thanks for the hope dude!

[6:42:53] jake_barn: there 100% be more coaching
[6:42:55] Athasin: @Kerviel_ No capts alone
[6:42:58] bobdang07hd: nope just fired
[6:43:06] red_eyed_jed1: den is too scared to talk to his captain so no comms is expected
[6:43:14] Athasin: And after the Lenny situation they can't even say it's because Johnson sued
[6:43:17] TimmayHS: bro they can't fire you in February that's fucked up
[6:43:21] zomgeo: fuck shift 1
[6:43:25] the_anti_imperialist: esfand was correct after all
[6:43:26] RJ1Official_: wait so have you had the meeting yet?
[6:43:26] Kaisenjin: @mavericks312 Cops retention is low... better start firing more people KEKW
[6:43:27] Luthonen: must be in 2 hours
[6:43:28] autisticboots: The Hawk and Cornwood situations were worse than yours
[6:43:31] zohaib_akh: eatttt
[6:43:33] autisticboots: thats the issue
[6:43:35] m4l1kkk: If they fire you just say, not this month and walk away 😭
[6:43:37] daboytay: If you get fired you gotta start yo own shit up bruh and run it yo way
[6:43:40] chmod_R_777: Denzel's got everyone's sympathy but no job EleGiggle
[6:43:42] RonJon: and hawk didn't even get dapped
[6:43:43] condor2104: today is my B'day so they can't fire you, lol
[6:43:45] masum_r: could den sue PD for the termination?
[6:43:46] cmnylHD: @mavericks312 I don’t think he’ll be fired. truly. I think the number of cops is one thing but number of good cops is also a big thing lacking. He’s a great cop
[6:43:46] Zanethereaper: another meeting push
[6:43:48] mad0monk: you should get yourself shot right now so it's their fault for missing the meeting, just go to the block
[6:43:53] thomas123456789012345677: so close to losing those first daps Dean
[6:43:56] EGGZOLENTZ: @red_eyed_jed1 denzel isnt scared, Ruth avoids him
[6:43:56] mavericks312: @kaisenjin exactly like if they fire den over this all 3 captains should be replaced especially slacks
[6:43:58] massteroid: @m4l1kkk this, lol
[6:44:01] Athasin: @autisticboots Eh, the Cornwood situation was exactly the same. Lenny's situation was worse.
[6:44:03] R3d_Gum: those captains are afkin joke tbh
[6:44:03] okeeffe20061: why’s he getting fires
[6:44:04] jake_barn: @daboytay you cant just start a PD lol
[6:44:05] RonJon: @masum_r it's specifically stated that anybody can be fired for any reason at any time
[6:44:06] Angel_ofMercy: Just breathe man keep your head up
[6:44:06] monkz89: exactly
[6:44:07] dwayne_121102: are you fired ?

[6:44:25] KingJayClouted: just don’t sit on the side walk
[6:44:26] Athasin: I'm saying all in no fired
[6:44:27] m4l1kkk: 80/20 twitch ratios, ain't no way
[6:44:28] aguy02: bro youre not getting fired
[6:44:28] Rctboy95: 60/40
[6:44:30] Kerviel_: totally understandable
[6:44:33] fishmeatx: nah 60 40
[6:44:33] cmnylHD: No way. Flip that! 80/20 not fired imo
[6:44:34] autisticboots: @athasin yeah i can agree w that as well, i’m more complaining about the lack of consistency and the clear favouritism
[6:44:34] the_main_burt: 80/20 not fired
[6:44:34] zomgeo: do any bookmakers have odds on this?
[6:44:35] m4l1kkk: The Pokimane contract

[6:44:44] daboytay: Let’s make a bet on it where them points at
[6:44:44] Luthonen: no you're not
[6:44:44] xnightshift2658: How does it work if you don't get fired? still at 10 daps?
[6:44:46] jinnytolls: They gonna make you an example
[6:44:46] tylerbaz123: personally I don’t think slacks should be a captain
[6:44:47] chmod_R_777: and sued for damages OMEGALUL
[6:44:49] jake_barn: 80/20, so a FaZe contract LMAO
[6:44:49] beansarentgreens: you should just make their lives hell if you get fired
[6:44:49] chmbrs: you got the twitch contract KEKW
[6:44:49] toenipsbetripin: There are other talks about the cpts not jsut the pd worried rn
[6:44:50] Ezi_GG: damn little optomistic now, you said 85/15 a while ago
[6:44:51] RonJon: ok
[6:44:51] mavericks312: the fact that Ruth said the pd isn’t as bad is ppl think tells me all I need to know about these captains
[6:44:52] zomgeo: I wish I could bet on this IRL
[6:44:52] J3mStone: Shiesty PI does sound good tho
[6:44:53] lemmytunngainus: Nah you trippin
[6:44:53] markshev: if turner was here no shot you get fired
[6:44:54] zac4e: I 100% feel like both Ruth and Slacks OOC feel like what they are doing is correct and its the right way. As a viewer, I am not gonna stay to watch stale ass robot cop RP
[6:44:55] cmnylHD: Don’t let it get in your head. You’re a good cop and they need you
[6:44:55] aguy02: he probably will be there
[6:44:56] Tcmasterzzz: where is turner?
[6:44:56] autisticboots: it honestly depends on their mood
[6:44:58] pukanacua: you're screwed if its just the 2 daptains
[6:44:58] KingJayClouted: ur not getting fired bra
[6:45:00] Kerviel_: @m4l1kkk that was Faze ratios, LUL
[6:45:01] monkz89: will there be a senior officer in place of turner doing the judgement? @Deansocool
[6:45:01] okeeffe20061: why’s he getting fired
[6:45:01] DonnieDarkoTheD: Should start with the yessu mastuh if it goes wrong just for content
[6:45:02] xypher85: @daboytay already 1 made
[6:45:05] Real_Bugz: You good bro

[6:45:06] misteren3rgy: Nah your good
[6:45:10] beansarentgreens: just turn into crackhead denzel
[6:45:10] jas3370: you wont get fired, at most demoted to PPO
[6:45:12] OdilonRedonn: nah the captains are aware Sheisty was bettering himself, they will show leniency
[6:45:13] MarUlberg: You get fired or you don't. 50/50 :)
[6:45:13] IanDooleyTV: they gave you like 7 in one day though. its so bullshit
[6:45:19] red_eyed_jed1: that would make sense if you only got one dap per incident
[6:45:19] MDM4ever1986HD: @Tcmasterzzz the guy who plays him he's dealing with family shit
[6:45:20] Athasin: @autisticboots Yep, the inconsistency and favoritism is crazy
[6:45:21] m4l1kkk: Authorized pit, blame Slacks
[6:45:22] cirocski: You gonna make a new character for pd if he does?
[6:45:22] the_anti_imperialist: all white pd wtf  just kidding
[6:45:23] millzeebb: no way you get fired
[6:45:25] Gachiguru: @OdilonRedonn Copege
[6:45:25] RonJon: i think if they do fire you they for sure let you re-join after a few weeks
[6:45:27] mrdudestar: I've never seen this pit
[6:45:28] Jethrq: THIS SUM BULLLLLSHIIII
[6:45:32] catechism_: Den "never pitting" Shiesty
[6:45:33] xnightshift2658: If you  don't get fired, just do speed traps from then on can't get daps doing speed traps
[6:45:35] vbrotherskaramazov: Perma death Den?
[6:45:36] dwayne_121102: when do you know ?
[6:45:36] bobdang07hd: All jokes aside, just dont lie and you'll be fine
[6:45:37] mcdevil1988: it would be a big mistake if you were getting fired. you are one of the best cops by far out there
[6:45:39] cmnylHD: Others have done worse since. You are ok. don’t go in defeated
[6:45:39] Athasin: Cleared for pit
[6:45:39] VioraX: getting fired is like a big decision tho bc it affects you irl aswell
[6:45:40] NemoBlu: reckon extended suspension till the first 4 daps are removed 27th Feb
[6:45:41] JsLeos: Cops cant be cool or creative without getting DAP'd, trash system seriously, hurts RP SAJ
[6:45:42] DanLGG: but they dap for the smallest shit. A dap for wrong shirt is the same as a dap for killing someone
[6:45:44] MakiWind: The chase have been going for 45 mins
[6:45:46] m4l1kkk: Eat a pop tart
[6:45:47] Tcmasterzzz: @Tcmasterzzz fair enough
[6:45:48] BigSeth: -.-
[6:45:48] LastWeekNextDay: get used to living in the dumpster @Deansocool
[6:45:50] misteren3rgy: They remove Daps out of the goodness in their heart
[6:45:51] sparky151: can you give a quick back story of the suspension
[6:45:54] m4l1kkk: Cinnamon pop tart fast
[6:45:55] ebos22: Ruth wants to set an example with you....to make it easier to fire Cornwood when he gets to 10 later this week
[6:45:57] chmbrs: can you check discord DMs real quick when you get a chance @Deansocool
[6:45:58] khlaah: I voted yes, he gets fired, but I can see how he doesn't get fired here.  if I could change my vote I would.
[6:45:59] TheOGWombat: it would have been ok if you pitted at 108.  you were going too slow evidently
[6:46:00] Acheron13: Imagine getting fired in February
[6:46:01] ForillChange: o7
[6:46:02] jake_barn: they also force you to be on duty if youre an officer so your chances of messing up are even higher
[6:46:02] duckkyyducky: Ruth boutta make den bark for his job
[6:46:02] Angel_ofMercy: best worst case sanario the should make you do academy and demote you best worst case
[6:46:03] Jshy2x: ur getting sacked in the morning
[6:46:07] mavericks312: if they fire den moon moon is legit gonna remove all 3 captains from power
[6:46:07] DonnieDarkoTheD: Well worst come to worst with being negative is that you are right
[6:46:09] okeeffe20061: what has he done to potentially get fired
[6:46:12] the_main_burt: get some food, expect the worstt but hope for the best you got it man
[6:46:12] Trixcross: you're not getting fired neither of them want to fire you and they have the choice it'd be ridiculous if they did
[6:46:13] lemmytunngainus: You were cleared for pit yes, but you pitted into people KEKW but you are not getting fired, maybe sent to academy or some shit
[6:46:14] grntcr: Den standing in his new home
[6:46:16] xnightshift2658: Ruth runs shift 1 black and white no grey area
[6:46:17] MDM4ever1986HD: had they called the chase off you wouldn't be in this situation?
[6:46:18] Kerviel_: That is why Ruby should be CoP, Rhodes Ass Chief, Turner, McNulty, Ruth as Captains. McNulty would have shouldered the blame for authorizing the pit
[6:46:20] jaxorts: Hopefully you get taken hostage or something before the meeting
[6:46:21] RonJon: imagine they didn't review until then and you went under 10
[6:46:22] Panos_97: I cannot wait for Turner to come back
[6:46:24] thomas123456789012345677: 6 days from now
[6:46:26] Mardomus: look at it this way. if you get fired there will in a big problem within pd

[6:46:29] TheSvess: what'd you get 4 daps for?
[6:46:29] autisticboots: lie down in the skip
[6:46:29] sparky151: can you give us the story on how you got suspended
[6:46:30] god7021: getting fired on february would be craxy tho
[6:46:31] dwayne_121102: sacked in the morning, you’re getting sacked in the morning
[6:46:32] CyboargTV: If you get back, dont run in the halls. You may get suspended again
[6:46:34] mad0monk: you know whats actually crazy? Captains who don't show up for a meeting on time
[6:46:34] DanLGG: you should’ve took the month off and just played crim
[6:46:34] georgiaassasin: i feel they just needed someone to make an example out of and thats you unfortunately bro
[6:46:36] Athasin: And what's crazy is even after your suspension people pit worse than you so you were made an example of for no reason.
[6:46:36] mathln: do a dry run for what you're gonna say
[6:46:39] burnreefer666: the pit master
[6:46:39] DonnieDarkoTheD: And tbh this drama is good content
[6:46:40] sparky151: hey

[6:46:49] EGGZOLENTZ: @ebos22 but she should go after cornwood not denzel, hes just a pawn in the scheme
[6:46:50] Janman88: w/o turner the last 3 ? weeks it has been even worse
[6:46:54] Gillshark: PD actually needs a union at this point, even cornwood said it
[6:46:56] Gachiguru: PepeLaugh i have info
[6:46:58] chmod_R_777: 4 DAPs in a day? What did you do for it? Went on a rampage and killed children in Los Santos??
[6:47:00] Gachiguru: ElNoSabe
[6:47:00] thomas123456789012345677: only if they did the review next week and you lose those daps right
[6:47:02] Trixcross: Denzel really down in the dumps
[6:47:03] Athasin: @georgiaassasin It's only an example if they punish other people after and they don't
[6:47:04] Mardomus: yeah the pd will strike if you get fired
[6:47:05] sparky151: what happened for you to her suspended
[6:47:07] mavericks312: slacks needs to be removed asap as captain
[6:47:08] xypher85: @Gachiguru HMMM
[6:47:09] duckkyyducky: Den and Johnson fired in February, police not even tryna hide it......
[6:47:10] cmnylHD: Sorry mods I should have asked before sharing
[6:47:10] Athasin: At that point it's targeted
[6:47:13] beansarentgreens: https://clips.twitch.tv/ResoluteHedonisticKimchiGingerPower-iLW6VXc26hT4UdNa
[6:47:20] OdilonRedonn: chat Nekoda is right, if Sheisty gets firedit will open a whole another can of worms for the PD and they dont want none of that
[6:47:21] cmnylHD: T boned
[6:47:23] xypher85: @Gachiguru discord gta meta

[7:17:23] m4l1kkk: Dean was 20 when GTA 5 dropped
[7:17:24] Juvraj: nopixel 5 will probably be on gta vi

[7:17:25] Evilzanz: cornwood outside
[7:17:27] TopicTech: they said gta6 will have actual current events evolve in the game

[7:17:47] georgiaassasin: anyone here play Helldivers 2 is it anygood?
[7:17:47] BigglesVII: Maybe they will incorporate it into the game
[7:17:49] KingJayClouted: it won’t be the same
[7:17:50] P51F144: @Deansocool it took them more than 6 months to turn Red dead around maybe a year
[7:17:51] psylongti: Not until GTA 6 sales fall at least

[7:18:19] KingJayClouted: it won’t be the same tho
[7:18:21] chunce0: They get too much money and ads from rp to get rid of it. gta6 will most likely have a devkit package to access the game natives
