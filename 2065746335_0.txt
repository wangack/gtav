[0:20:03] Deviii_: thats fair
[0:20:08] Spartoriius: if they keep getting rammed and pit at 100 mph they will start gunning cops down
[0:20:14] quinnntino: shoot the tires EZ
[0:20:14] RadahTatTat: highway blasting is more of a mechanical issue, so that's frustration.
[0:20:19] SireOfTheLake: peepoWave Hi Custy and Chat
[0:20:21] Booyal: I don't mind the metas or the accountability on officers for goin hard, i just hate the crims complaining after about safety LUL
[0:20:22] ido_opsies: I also feel like the taurus is very strong against some vehicles right now so crims without the super fast cars have to swap

[0:21:12] SeaOfEmpty: How can one cop car stop anyone? You can't pit without 2
[0:21:16] notrickbra_: to be fair, impounding the car costs more than the fine, so if they using personal cars, after 10 swaps their bank account is gone lmao
[0:21:25] jbirdosaurus: A big factor is that having a passenger makes so many of the cars perform like a C class, drop offs are almost necessary to stand a chance bazzSit

[0:50:45] foxfear: yea there could have been 10 cars instead of 5
[0:50:54] wheatenz: The guy who ejected hit one of those immovable poles. They seems to deadly. Was it Bones and I think another cop ejected who hit them along that bridge on the chase with all the Glendales after laundromat?
[0:50:55] SeaOfEmpty: So you stay and shoot the ingot if it drives over an officer, tell it to leave, etc
[0:51:04] wheatenz: seem to be*
[0:51:27] slabbyj_: you only have to drive them away from the scene, not pursue them like Lenny elected to

[0:53:57] slabbyj_: its kinda weird if crims know the police SOPs tho?

[1:18:39] random_viewer_55: for an extended pieriod of time though
[1:18:45] Bi0_: manual labor or service -for an extended period of time- what is that time range?
[1:18:55] FilzG: @shramtots thats not what trafficking means lmao
[1:18:55] shae__void: you handled that scene amazingly brother o7
[1:18:57] jacksmithcje: I’m confused I feel like original scene or officer off duty need to explain this situation soo much better regarding kit
[1:19:09] imcalledphil: isnt this basically the same thing peanut did to kit?
[1:19:11] BadRabbits: iirc the human trafficing charge didn't stick on peanut because it had to be for an extended period of time?
[1:19:16] hoanzlgoas: baboozled
[1:19:17] notrickbra_: yeah but you skipping the extended period of time part
[1:19:30] Konkwistador_1002: is it extended period thp?
[1:19:30] RoguePandaHD: what labour was intended on being committed?
[1:19:36] shae__void: @badrabbits the case is on the docket he’s being charged for it
[1:19:40] jbirdosaurus: That's worded kinda poorly tbh, what is performing labor? Just putting your hands up burns calories
[1:19:48] shae__void: @roguepandahd driving apparently
[1:19:51] BadRabbits: @Shae__Void the archer one?!
[1:20:03] random_viewer_55: does it fall under "an extended period of time" though?
[1:20:08] RoguePandaHD: hmmm tricky one
[1:20:13] Bi0_: but is driving across the city "extended period of time"?
[1:20:13] HogballTV: its is this is what they got peanut on mculty
[1:20:13] shae__void: @badrabbits yes! it was just approved the other day, it’s going to docket. peanut facing 7 years in prison!
[1:20:18] PanicAtNabisco: Driving equals labor
[1:20:19] BerryG_333: Doesn't hurt to start of with the highest charge, negotiate down
[1:20:20] RoguePandaHD: idk if forcing someone to drive to a location would be laborious
[1:20:24] Bi0_: yeahhh exactly.
[1:20:29] allendork: good scene control for what it's worth :)
[1:20:30] hoanzlgoas: bamboozled, real Crim was elsewhere, Archer is laughing and pets her white cat
[1:20:33] BadRabbits: @Shae__Void shiiiit i thought it was dropped. that's kinda dope
[1:20:33] Bi0_: yup it is.
[1:20:35] shae__void: driving under duress is absolutely a labor
[1:20:36] random_viewer_55: well the wording is subjective
[1:20:37] jointspecialist: across the state counts in my book
[1:20:43] random_viewer_55: let the judges decide anyway
[1:20:44] 10111001111001: court case EZ
[1:20:46] freddyboy420: realistically that's like 10-15 mins max
[1:20:47] shae__void: @badrabbits gonna be a wild 4 hour court case KEKW
[1:20:54] AfroAltruism: you pay people for taxi's all the time, obviously its labour
[1:20:57] BladesofICE: i feel wanting a apology wouldnt be a extended period, but thats for a judge to decide
[1:21:02] BadRabbits: @Shae__Void ramee defending?
[1:21:20] plawpsruby: Might have to ask a judge to see what they think because the wording makes it confusing
[1:21:21] FilzG: the wording is wrong, but I get what they mean. Usually human traficking occurs in the period of several days or weeks or months
[1:21:24] shae__void: @badrabbits oh let’s hope so (for the content) KEKW but most likely
[1:21:31] the_jackal25: I see your argument, on the other hand, I think you could reasonably read "intent to compel" to imply that the transportation and the manual labor are at separate times – the labor is compelled *after* the transportation
[1:21:38] jointspecialist: more than a few minutes
[1:21:39] PepperAnn131: What a fucking shitshow Senor Buns is. I would never go anywhere near that hellhole.
[1:21:43] woolfdesign: Cornwood is almost a judge
[1:21:45] random_viewer_55: Did Peanut get human trafficking over the Kit Archer thing??
[1:21:57] random_viewer_55: If he did we got an idea of what extended period of time means
[1:22:03] combattingjosh: @PepperAnn131 should have seen it last night KEKW
[1:22:11] shae__void: @random_viewer_55 it’s on the docket, was approved, court this week i think?
[1:22:16] BadRabbits: is it just me or are the taurus' electric today
[1:22:17] jbirdosaurus: I think a decent lawyer could really pull the wording of that law apart
[1:22:23] random_viewer_55: @Shae__Void so we still don't know
[1:22:43] MrHyde81: Why does the city not have a standalone kidnapping charge?
[1:22:44] FilzG: extended period of time is subjective, it can go your way or the lawyers way in trial, depends on the judge´
[1:22:52] shae__void: @random_viewer_55 we don’t know the outcome yet correct. but he’s looking at 7 years!
[1:22:54] gucciflare: So is archer still missing?

[1:38:14] RadahTatTat: @random_viewer_55 no, you're missing what custard just said (that he doesn't know how to RP those moments because his character shouldnt see them IC)
[1:38:16] BluSphinx: Dap this bazzShake
[1:38:16] bangerang2: in 3.0 it didnt help that the answer to any complaint was "we'll look into it" and i think it very rarely was
[1:38:16] Wheez_3D: Didn't ruby also agree with Mcnulty with not dapping
[1:38:20] SymbioAgori: What is his opinion on an skeleton crew officer being at 10 DAPs?
[1:38:20] meggzbenni: what is dap? does that stand for somethign?
[1:38:20] thebogeym4n: Now compare the Lenny Hawk pit and Denzel's pit KEKW

[1:38:48] Deltacron701: People need to understand that Moon made Lenny to be boarderline psychopath/unstable and he is sticking to that character

[1:44:27] williamwellwood: it hurt me to type it lol
[1:44:27] dylanconlon6: DD/MM/YYYY
[1:44:34] theLastMooninite: Makes sense to me, I'd say "its febuary seventeeth 2024" as a sentence
[1:44:36] RadahTatTat: that's the FREEDOM DATE buther NODDERS
[1:44:43] themanwithanrx7: I hate it
[1:44:43] wolfemeister: day month year is the superior format
[1:44:46] VSDuck: custyWAVE
[1:44:47] RadahTatTat: makes ZERO sense KEKW
[1:44:48] Booyal: month day year is the only way that makes sense to me LUL
[1:44:52] tayyy1511: I like YYYY/DD/MM Kappa

[1:44:57] Cottonbelle: i love being american regardless of all the shite talk about it.
[1:44:58] Korlinni: Both formats make sense
[1:45:03] judge_hat: classic snr buns
[1:45:05] gorofs: Year month day is best, but just writing it down from february 17th 2024 it would be 2/17/2024
[1:45:10] innistrad7: @theLastMooninite 17th of febuary
[1:45:20] Broseph_Brotato: but for real YYYY/MM/DD is the best format
[1:45:23] HaywoodAdventures: very few things in America make sense
[1:45:27] theLastMooninite: They need the HVAC security guards stationed at Senior Buns
[1:45:27] Firewolfneo: @innistrad7 you used more words though
[1:45:40] gorofs: but things ultimately make sense based on how you were raised
[1:45:40] RonJon: @innistrad7 ive never said the date day first every in my life
[1:45:42] Cottonbelle: @HaywoodAdventures i can say that about most countries
[1:45:45] RadahTatTat: @theLastMooninite AAAA tru
[1:45:46] Estidal: @Broseph_Brotato Objectively correct
[1:45:50] Nico_47: The date formst agrument is the hot dog a sandwich argument, im over it lol
[1:45:53] kaizynh: It makes sense for how you would verbally say it.
[1:45:55] Estidal: @innistrad7 4th of July?
[1:45:56] the_jackal25: It's America, not making sense and flexing about it is kinda their thing
[1:45:58] xseaka: in real like, you're gonna say whats the dat? Oh 2023 February 17?
[1:46:05] innistrad7: @Firewolfneo yeah but grammatically it flows better
[1:46:08] FlameReetardantPanda: chat arguing the merit of decisions made long ago arbitrarily classic
[1:46:14] HaywoodAdventures: @Cottonbelle ok?
[1:46:20] random_viewer_55: Trygg's ISO also makes sense

[1:46:27] Cottonbelle: @HaywoodAdventures ok to what you said as well lol
[1:46:27] random_viewer_55: yyyy-mm-dd
[1:46:31] datascribe: i like year month day, it is perfect to store
[1:46:35] NumbLee: YYYY/MM/DD makes since because it sorts itself
[1:46:38] innistrad7: @FlameReetardantPanda mate, as an englishman with american friends i have had this discussion a LOT
[1:46:45] Kevman459: my american car gets 40 rods to the hogshead and thats the way i likes it
[1:46:52] williamwellwood: its the only thing that makes sense lol
[1:47:20] datascribe: he heard bike and forgot all about it PepeLaugh
[1:47:24] NumbLee: Real question is why not 13 month years.
[1:47:42] RonJon: yeah making it a prime number can't go wrong
[1:48:00] Easy_2: say today’s date out loud to yourself.
[1:48:09] theLastMooninite: Found it
[1:48:11] RadahTatTat: logically DD/MM/YY makes sense but MM/DD/YY makes sense to Americans because our language (english) is confusing and dumn NODDERS
[1:48:17] RonJon: february seventheenth twenty twenty four

[1:48:57] Easy_2: thats why seeing dates written dd/mm/yyyy confuses me
[1:49:34] Easy_2: because when i tell people what day it is or what day my birthday is i say the month first
[1:49:37] RadahTatTat: @Easy_2 that's cuz it's the way we were raised to say it, not everyone says it in this order NODDERS
[1:49:48] hachoopoo: Pog tony leung!
[1:50:12] Easy_2: @radahtattat exactly
[1:50:25] RonJon: @RadahTatTat thats why year comes first so it doesn't matter how we say it and it automatically sorts
