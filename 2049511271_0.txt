[1:54:21] conzfearacy12: @Skinnydeads sure
[1:54:28] iamhisuncle: good job
[1:54:29] itskvn__: @NEON_22 They're never going to do that. I mean if they stay, it will tank more and the open turfs will be taken already. It makes sense to act now.
[1:54:30] baxsm: TheCompany
[1:54:30] StreamElements: Join the Discord to be apart of Ray's amazing community!! raycHype raycL --> https://discord.gg/rayc <--
[1:54:37] yyonniepz: @Skinnydeads he right tho

[1:55:11] jaysonkat: She is mad
[1:55:12] NEON_22: @NEON_22 look at the rep atm they were pushing on there and they sitill had 100% even as zaza grew
[1:55:14] fambaa: do you have a cold ray?
[1:55:15] Hooded_G: @zandrusz yea I mean the ppl in Cyprus are going to push them out. Zaza rep keeps tanking, they can easily get another south side turf and push out other groups before they get rep
[1:55:28] inksumo: rob target
[1:55:30] StreamElements: Ray has an active Twitter that you can use to stay up to date with him! raycHypeTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheRay_C
[1:55:30] itskvn__: @Skinnydeads Nah, zaza been going down  since the first day it showed in the app basically from the first moment the other group has been pushing.
[1:55:37] fambaa: dang that sucks, get well soon
[1:55:37] djsquires1112: wheres the box for her??
[1:55:44] rstineffect: Well kits getting robbed
[1:55:50] wrentula: please get the rest you need
[1:55:50] conzfearacy12: @itskvn__ exactly the moment ming stopped selling
[1:56:03] SunflowerJessie: Prayge she gets to have her bike unit back
[1:56:10] NEON_22: @Skinnydeads na its cause there not selling cause they got shot if they pushed both can easily get 100 each
[1:56:18] Bryguy_eH: Akuma Ray return Prayge
[1:56:24] SunflowerJessie: @lkxseventh Da Fuq?
[1:56:30] itskvn__: @NEON_22 It never went up though. It was at 58 went down, went up a bit and went down even more. Never actually went above 58.
[1:56:44] NEON_22: @NEON_22 yes it did
[1:56:49] SunflowerJessie: @lkxseventh i don’t know u LUL
[1:56:51] princess_2156: phantomzzWave
[1:56:59] itskvn__: @conzfearacy12 And also the moment we saw all of them starting to push hard.
[1:57:05] fambaa: @NEON_22 I think the system changed pretty sure it wasnt tug of war day 1 then it got patched with the new % and now it is
[1:57:07] h4des__20: The unicorn as a gift @Ray__C Parasocial
[1:57:14] zandrusz: @Hooded_G sounds like they need to have more sellers than the people in cypress to push them out
[1:57:15] dantikks: @princess_2156 strikingWave
[1:57:31] elviz_u: u still banned fromt esting cars !ray
[1:57:32] itskvn__: @NEON_22 I doubt both crews can both get 100, doesn't make sense the way the city is setup in 4.0
[1:57:40] NEON_22: @fambaa  why should they get it then without a pay out
[1:57:43] Ninja_v1: ellie the biggest KITMOND supporter

[1:57:58] g_host_28: KITMOND

[1:57:59] BOOOMIC: princess_2156 PogU HYPE
[1:58:00] elviz_u: u still banned from testing cars @Ray__C
[1:58:03] NEON_22: @NEON_22 u got no way to prove that
[1:58:07] fambaa: @NEON_22 why would the on paper stronger strain have to pay the weaker strain to leave
[1:58:10] Skinnydeads: @NEON_22 giving them the turf also essentially says we lost the war
[1:58:12] jaysonkat: No cup of tea ??
[1:58:18] g_host_28: Hi Chat wavee
[1:58:21] Skinnydeads: even reputation wise it would be bad if you do not get massive buyout
[1:58:22] faceman_actual: hewwo
[1:58:27] jojo_s93: @BOOOMIC this is what we needed backseating
[1:58:30] dantikks: @g_host_28 wave
[1:58:37] zandrusz: @Skinnydeads that depends is this a turf war now?
[1:58:40] NEON_22: @fambaa that makes no sence
[1:58:53] Shark_Whole: :Z
[1:58:56] Skinnydeads: @zandrusz will be framed as such
[1:58:57] inaudiblecone: raycSadge
[1:58:59] NEON_22: @NEON_22 na that dont me that at all they can push them out later
[1:59:00] mnsports83: Sigh
[1:59:02] jaysonkat: Cup of coffee??
[1:59:10] Shark_Whole: Sigh
[1:59:20] emmyluu: the fastest catch up ever lol
[1:59:20] fambaa: its turf war, you have to outsell and prevent the other group to sell, otherwise any weak group would simply demand to get paid to not get the turf
[1:59:31] Bleepinbloopin: Sigh
[1:59:33] alpasoup1: Wait what does she want to talk about
[1:59:34] jebus510: No erp KomodoHype
[1:59:35] BOOOMIC: RayCAware
[1:59:36] itskvn__: @Skinnydeads Who cares, staying there will end up with zaza never going to 100 (if it is true) and all other turfs will be taken. The Company would never be 100 unless actually going crazy with pushing. It would be good to act now and be first in another turf.

[6:48:59] JayThaCollector: yes

[6:49:06] HawkzyMusic: 100% and increases your audience reach as some people prefer certain platforms
[6:49:06] zipexile: platform arbitrage
[6:49:07] WaltZaddy: it depends on your niche
[6:49:08] KaizoCandy: most people dthat streamon yt have alot of viewers on their videos
[6:49:09] solowanderor: without knowing your deals no one hear can answer that
[6:49:11] tonethemoan: mah
[6:49:11] tteokbokkio: stream on CNN
[6:49:12] china_whyte: no
[6:49:12] sandzbf: you’re not taking away from your twitch audience though
[6:49:12] DeafxKid: YEP
[6:49:13] novakcsn: I think it depends on how large of a streamer you are
[6:49:14] KlNNS: wouldnt it impact performance and internet? @Ray__C
[6:49:15] Koltary: @Ray__C you can put the sponsor on both which is crazy
[6:49:16] Prometheus_alGhul: mhm makes sense
[6:49:16] dootadoo: That's like the NFL playing NCAA. Guess who is the NCAA
[6:49:17] OnlyStriker: bro youtube frogs wont come here..
[6:49:17] joeerror: Go for as close to 100% of the payment as possible. End goal is people watch your owned streaming service.
[6:49:18] raj_r997: I will watch yt if you do multi
[6:49:20] eclecticjake: There are a lot of people who just want start watching on twitch but are already on YouTube so will watch there

[6:49:21] oopsieadam: stream on CNN kek
[6:49:21] ThaRealMocaMoca: Yes and kick is forrrr LOSERS
[6:49:22] sunngoddnikka: They will grasp it eventually
[6:49:22] OmarInJapan: You should only use other platforms to bring in viewers to your main one @Ray__C
[6:49:24] PorkLegoKai: maybe could try for 1 year or months?
[6:49:27] sandzbf: your gaining net new subscribers
[6:49:28] ssjbx7: it depends on you tbh
[6:49:30] china_whyte: brother you have analytics period
[6:49:31] usualpython89: true
[6:49:33] QueenHeraTV: !points
[6:49:33] inspectorHollie: i get it but
[6:49:35] ilymiso: trye
[6:49:37] itzyoumanz: ask oh ta ta about it
[6:49:38] psyduckmd: If you move different platform you like expanding
[6:49:38] nippytime: can't you just combine them?
[6:49:40] jasonflipmode: The thing is this listen people keep you open in
[6:49:40] Broken99: its still exposure
[6:49:42] SirScuttle: it would grow your youtube probably
[6:49:42] zipexile: sponsors get multiplier effect
[6:49:43] JayThaCollector: alot of people like youtube because you can go back on the player
[6:49:43] china_whyte: you are
[6:49:44] inspectorHollie: ha
[6:49:45] clash_o7: Yes, you want to multistream and drive viewers to twitch @Ray__C
[6:49:45] sneakyPizzA: could market a higher view count which is probably all sponsors care about
[6:49:46] guinaresg: Youtube
[6:49:46] heflax: ur stream would should up next to rp clip channels so u can capitalize on random clips
[6:49:47] tonethemoan: its bonus for sponser’s more platforms ofc
[6:49:49] imomoiro: depends on your sponsor contract.
[6:49:49] KartikayK: everyone is
[6:49:50] Broken99: you are
[6:49:50] fedeffj: Try it
[6:49:51] dilemmaofemma: i think it works off the assumption you would only gain viewers because viewers are less likely to leave the platform they already use
[6:49:51] inspectorHollie: true
[6:49:53] Skinnydeads: probably good to grow your youtube by streaming there
[6:49:53] bluguss: What if you do one and end the other one half way
[6:49:54] china_whyte: twitch lifted the ban on that
[6:49:55] Shindzii: if u show them your stats it wouldnt matter
[6:49:55] Krunsk_: most agencies and brands have a hard time measuring campaign success on Twitch so multi streaming good luck lol
[6:49:56] MisterParry: multistream on YouTube for the extra bitrate and higher resolution
[6:49:57] sunngoddnikka: If more creators do simultaneous streaming, the sponsors will grasp it's value
[6:49:57] demonicski: omieGiggle
[6:49:58] BigDigDev: @ray__c do you think you and the boys will end up buying a mansion in no pixel at some point on the journey?
[6:49:58] dootadoo: There are millions on twitch. There are Billions on YT.
[6:49:59] ilymiso: I guess it all depends on the streamer and how much it would benefit them
[6:50:00] Hooded_G: spin it like they reach more audiences @Ray__C
[6:50:03] MokumAllef: Do you think the viewers on the other platform will come from Twitch though?
[6:50:05] Mike_3053: everyone can multi stream partner or not
[6:50:06] demonicski: shxtouPops shxtouPops shxtouPops
[6:50:08] WebGems: some streamers are still on old contracts
[6:50:10] GAMANTAKA: @jasonflipmode gibberish wym
[6:50:10] imomoiro: But whatever viewers you make on multi...its still viewers and money?
[6:50:12] ThaRealMocaMoca: No kick unless you hack prob?
[6:50:14] psyduckmd: why not?
[6:50:14] Gamakind: if you're a huge streamer and dont care about view count then thats the only time id consider multistreaming
[6:50:16] clash_o7: its based on individual contracts
[6:50:16] demonicski: omieCheer omieCheer omieCheer
[6:50:19] jasonflipmode: What we did with a friend is when he went to kick we all just kept the windows open in both windows
[6:50:21] h2osouls: VoteNay VoteNay VoteNay VoteNay
[6:50:24] freak1030: i'm a lurker and I prefer YT
[6:50:26] demonicski: shxtouLights
[6:50:27] itzyoumanz: the person who wins is the one to figure out cross chat mod
[6:50:27] aersoe: larger partners have individual contracts chattes
[6:50:32] SUNsh9n: raycMods okey
[6:50:35] OnlyStriker: well affectively you are still having YT + twitch audience. so sponsors shouldnt care tbh
[6:50:35] IlBreeze: youll have issues when it comes to DMCA'd music and what sponsorships want you to do, although they might ask you to stream their segment on 1 platform only
[6:50:37] ZachDGames: @Ray__C if you still have your old contract from before the policy was changed I believe you cant, but once that runs through you will be able too. Friend was in a similar situation
[6:50:37] gas939: partner manager is like why you want to multi stream? Susge
[6:50:37] jasonflipmode: Can reach a pretty big base like that
[6:50:37] SpikeTrees: lol the chat sucks on youtube
[6:50:38] tteokbokkio: i love that you can rewind on YT
[6:50:39] inspectorHollie: his hair tho is amazing
[6:50:43] jackthedazzle: here the thing,if you are doing multistream twitch and kick you can stream if you want and no worry music dmca but only make sure if vod split work on twitch work. but youtube gonna be nuke live stream due dmca stuff @Ray__C
[6:50:44] WaltZaddy: YT is better imo
[6:50:45] Gwenedy: I love watching on Youtube, it’s more convenient to use and no ads
[6:50:46] Hooded_G: @freak1030 real and true
[6:50:51] h2osouls: i’m a lurker and I prefer twitch maybe even a Kick because no ads
[6:50:57] KushKowboy6: YEP check with your manager. Hasan had an OLD exclusivity deal and he figured out a way to multistream so I’d recommend checking
[6:51:02] Kevinkrizz1: how is youtube ui still so bad tho
[6:51:02] iantenna: Twitch chat is so far superior to other platforms
[6:51:03] rightan: !give queenheratv 300000
[6:51:04] StreamElements: @rightan, you only have 248050 Meds.
[6:51:08] imomoiro: Thing is Ray...you may have low viewers when live on YT but the offline Views is HUGE

[6:51:35] KlNNS: youtube is a video platform tho it doesnt have a streamer community just individules
[6:51:35] RabCrangoon: I would watch YT a lot more if they had a better live-stream "browsing" section.
[6:51:35] jasonflipmode: You can multi stream says twitch that war over with already adin Ross fixed that with hstikkytokky
[6:51:36] melodya03: It's a lot
[6:51:37] 72hdemus: thats 1.3b omE
[6:51:37] Vinn_: the graphic makes it looks like its a lot closer than it really is
[6:51:37] BennyXco: yeah but that's just gaming, youtube prioritizes the rest of their videos
[6:51:39] MokumAllef: 25 percent orso?
[6:51:44] K1ngMarduck: 4x
[6:51:45] Skinnydeads: @gas939 yeah if large % of streamers are multi on yt, twitch will die slowly

[6:56:18] Shadophile: Kick is still extremely new to the scene, where Twitch has 10+years, so theyre still working out all the kinks
[6:56:20] damnitcutmesomeslack: how many butc does the company have?
[6:56:21] Krunsk_: Twithc has done a poor job to educate the world on its strengths and to attract brands. they don't have any internal tools for brands to search influencers, measure campaign success. it is pretty new and it makes more difficult for brands to get on twitch
[6:56:21] scarface2769: any new pc stuff?

[6:58:01] hingle_mccringleb3rry: @ArtemisRost def not selfish to put yourself and ur family first
[6:58:05] ArtemisRost: @mayojuices i wouldnt, i cant say for sure no one can since the group of people that have that choice is infinetly small, so arguing on i would or you would is dumb

[12:12:15] Yaranaika789: I think they are aiming for job specialized crews instead now that there are no whitelists but a rep based system. so they just need to make the chain of actions very tedious
