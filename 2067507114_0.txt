[0:56:58] giantpanda: I found out the hard way @Deansocool
[0:56:58] Zurku: i feel like each punishment should be different depending on what the person did instead of just suspended
[0:56:58] wiil_wfc1881: have you been suspened

[1:19:41] slight621: When Den Zel comes back, he should lobby for a DAP reform where you have 24 hours to decide on suspension or firing, because this is bullshit

[1:20:14] MatmatikOfficial: I think Denz is 100% being targeted
[1:20:14] jinnytolls: @Deansocool not even using turn signalsmh
[1:20:16] combattingjosh: consistency isn't a thing KEKW
[1:20:19] a2th3vi: PD getting sued for a Lenny pit
[1:20:19] TimmayHS: @DonNiko99 idk I think 1 week
[1:20:20] Kayklip: its the suspension during Black History Month for me
[1:20:20] drrmop: Lenny rammed Dundee at 130 because the chase was called off
[1:20:22] popcornispoggers: There have been so many things, like Cornwood shooting bodies and he gets away with everything lmao
[1:20:23] BLazOR_Prime: @Landoram lenny pitted a girl into the ocean and she ocean dumped and he showed a video on the projector. But den pits a car and it accidentaly hits someone he gets suspended, crazy the difference
[1:20:24] qats: https://clips.twitch.tv/GenerousPrettiestButterFrankerZ-C_AQKC7mWoJgTpWu
[1:20:24] pieruruka: mcnulty recommended 2 daps for the lenny pit, so it is kinda consisten
[1:20:27] shramtots: MOON pitted like crazy to prove a point to captins that its unfair
[1:20:27] Zarniwooper: Esfand mentioned that something happened that where you got a dap from and now its allowed, cant remember what it was
[1:20:32] SirGO0SE: Moonmoon pits to kill and is looking at DAPs as an allowance to do so atpRtsd4
[1:20:33] FilzG: @TimmayHS yeah cause he doesnt know its meta
[1:20:35] slight621: Ran out of blinker fluid
[1:20:35] Downbag: Lenny had a PIT, that is even more out of line (over 100) than yours
[1:20:35] quaylewastaken: Your was under a over pass. You never said anything when they said it was a high pedestrian area
[1:20:35] getanime: @M00zzy did he got DAP for that?
[1:20:38] BadRabbits: yeah i think slacks said your pit was fine. but someone got hurt and there has to be a punishment. if you weren't on 9 daps the single dap would have been completely fair.
[1:20:40] Chavalin: its all about the swift you are in
[1:20:41] element_of_atlas: Imagine sueing the pd for targeting
[1:20:41] RocketMcCoy: @DanLGG They tried swimming away probably and just drowned from how it looked in his POV
[1:20:43] M00zzy: @a2 oh ya thats right.
[1:20:43] Skenoj: EZ Clap dapp
[1:20:46] marneraiders: Don’t forget your not On duty: Traffic laws apply, no lights and sirens right now
[1:20:47] MPGod42: D: you're braking the law?
[1:20:47] whacksapple: chat, all captains were away this weekend. thats why there hasnt been any progress on daps and shit
[1:20:48] shadow66601: lenny made a 3000 words statement to justify one of his pit
[1:20:50] RobRoads: yes
[1:20:51] BadRabbits: sorry saabb not slacks
[1:20:52] FilzG: yes

[1:21:02] Pee_aRe: yes
[1:21:05] shramtots: No captins have been on for 3 days...

[1:21:10] Van_1912: @KappaManJason special treatment?  cornwood online 16 hours a day and spent 200k on PD.
[1:21:10] M00zzy: @getanime I dont think he got talked to about it i could be wrong
[1:21:10] AndreSays: @deansocool can't find the clip but thoroughbred is fed up with captains bs and making moves
[1:21:12] a2th3vi: @zarniwooper moving an arrested crim away from the initial crime scene
[1:21:13] SpiritEX: o7 patience

[1:21:14] BadRabbits: uh cornhole is at the farm today
[1:21:16] alanm306: Call to see is there any update
[1:21:18] skedaddelr: i mean might be better to wait for slacks
[1:21:18] RonJon: It's been a while but to be fair there's been no captains on for days lol
[1:21:20] iJerrBear: I think 60 days for the DAP fall off is a bit bs, thats too long of a period, maybe like 30-45 days
[1:21:25] Kayklip: like an std
[1:21:26] newtricksterx: @popcornispoggers do u mean when dean made that sbs charcter
[1:21:28] MoohamedAlii: in side

[1:21:34] jinnytolls: He may not be online because of otk meeting tonight + partents visiting @Deansocool
[1:21:34] Kayklip: omg
[1:21:35] quinnntino: In side
[1:21:35] DanLGG: @RocketMcCoy IMO officers should have qualified immunity but the circumstances are the same. A pit led to an individual being injured. Thats what Denzel was dapped for
[1:21:37] bdg_andy: you should be due an update atleast. so yeah you should phone Ruth
[1:21:37] Zarniwooper: @a2th3vi yeah that was it, now its even recommended and Den got a DAP from it
[1:21:38] skedaddelr: ruth will say "you'll be notified when a decision is made"
[1:21:39] jas3370: whats the worse that can happen from asking ruth for an update
[1:21:39] getanime: @M00zzy wow so no dap
[1:21:46] BDG_parth28: How do u know how they feel like deannn deanso4K deanso4K deanso4K
[1:21:51] Landoram: just watch little texas and make reports
[1:21:55] FilzG: jackson also seems like a backstabber
[1:22:06] blowaways: surely they need you back asap
[1:22:08] rreidd: rp been getting sued so much that now theyre trying to crack down suspending and firing everyone
[1:22:12] BLazOR_Prime: @FilzG yeah i dont trust him either
[1:22:13] tyler__96: Technically aren't you automatically unsuspended once you lose them first 4 daps?
[1:22:13] SpiritEX: monkaS
[1:22:16] karaskyee: adverse action notice
[1:22:17] Fossabot: If your enjoying the stream smash the DAMN follow button! I mean shit its just a click away... Might see your name on screen ;)
[1:22:18] RocketMcCoy: @DanLGG I think it also hurts that he was a 3rd party not the problem and he sued too
[1:22:20] RobRoads: RP needs you
[1:22:21] iJerrBear: @FilzG mans was quick with it too
[1:22:22] Kayklip: nahhh they need you
[1:22:23] BDG_parth28: Dryest most political answer ever
[1:22:24] Landoram: actually use camera and cassette to film crime up in Little Texas
[1:22:25] angrycrumpet13: Do DAPS disappear if ur let back in PD? Id imagine not

[1:22:28] lKouRa: do you think is gonna be a good decision? @Deansocool
[1:22:30] dean2busy: hi
[1:22:32] BDG_parth28: Clisp POGDOGGERS
[1:22:32] jinnytolls: There was only one cop from shift one on duty on saturday @Deansocool
[1:22:33] BadRabbits: you're propper unlucky that this happened while 2 captains are tied up IRL
[1:22:33] autisticboots: RUNNING RED LIGHTS
[1:22:34] Athasin: @DanLGG And cops literally run people over and don't get in trouble for it.
[1:22:37] more_parrots: they got many new cadets they not strugglingh
[1:22:39] RadiantOrbit: They absolutely do need you
[1:22:39] alanm306: It's still a good few days since u where suspended they should have a decision by now
[1:22:40] slight621: RP NEEDS DEN ZEL!!!
[1:22:40] offspringfan683: I think the biggest issue with DAPs is they fall off after 60 days, instead of looking at DAPs per hours on shift. More hours on duty = more chances for DAPs
[1:22:41] deanemans12: Pd getting worse since den suspension
[1:22:44] Thought_Spiral: Clip-Lash
[1:22:44] heat31: Cornwood keeps bringing up that Den was working on a lot of critical investigations that nobody has picked up since his suspension @Deansocool
[1:22:52] lKouRa: what you feeling right now?
[1:22:54] KDRaid: @offspringfan683 true
[1:22:57] bdg_hyu: they 1000% gave you the tenth dap as an experiment to see how they would handle the situation

[1:23:03] Thozel: i am so rooting for you. I bet you get good review
[1:23:05] TheMah1337: Lenny Hawk pitted someone into the ocean
[1:23:08] Downbag: They actually need Den, because of your investigations
[1:23:08] naveenmani: 15 daps for 60 days would be good
[1:23:11] alanm306: I need to see the lenny pit into the ocean in thses clips 😂
[1:23:12] FilzG: @iJerrBear says he's gonna talk to captains but never does, says its gonna be a quick suspension but never pushes the conversation, it was him that said primary is to blame on PITs
[1:23:13] RyinTwitch: https://clips.twitch.tv/RefinedFreezingStarlingFutureMan-UC5xvPH6_prQSxQz
