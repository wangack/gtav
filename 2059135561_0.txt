[2:15:11] imSammers: face it, the valet exists because everyone HATES when their cars are fucked with.
[2:15:13] Rise0fTheNerds: More maybe a few less valets, but mostly valet limits so the lot has to fill up in many instances?
[2:15:14] CivilianBystander: feel like the valet should be an actual valet job where they drive your cars to a lot or something
[2:15:14] Huso833: KEKW chat still saying that

[2:15:21] skelehands: I love that one guy said that and it's just a fact now
[2:15:23] ogjoker88: Atleast make it charge like 200$ to park would make less people do it
[2:15:23] Huso833: Someone always says that it's the new meme
[2:15:24] buffynaz: they should charge for valets
[2:15:25] granddemon: @PENTA It would be different if the Valet was RP (like in Tusks case) but it's just menuing, feels wrong.
[2:15:25] shirahama_: it does make it feel lifeless
[2:15:26] dabbasaurus19: ____
[2:15:28] GooJuice: why do they do valet then?

[2:15:37] AerialAce94: the server stability thing was just because people had shitty 3rd party cars
[2:15:40] stochasticdev: Yeah just like the enterprising marabuntas NODDERS
[2:15:40] cardiacschlerosis: NODDERS
[2:15:41] JTVham: yeah it makes it feel lifeless Sadge

[2:15:47] ZyberFox: Have to go somewhere to get your car NODDERS
[2:15:47] FattyPneumonia: not every house and shit
[2:15:49] DoingBusiness: there should be like 3 valet spots
[2:15:52] ElysiumDj: Yeah and only apartments or housing
[2:15:53] dug4lyf: then valet can go all ferris beuller
[2:15:54] freedomboy696969: it's so they can make their cars invincible while they aren't being used
[2:15:54] sterowentUS: Madge how about fuck all this, let's get the crime going chop chop
[2:15:55] btbrian: Parking lots create hubs
[2:15:57] slurmy: keep the same number of valet spots but charge $200 every time they use it
[2:15:59] domzzav: why are there so many valet spots? makes the server seem dead
[2:16:01] Oced: gotta valet so tony doesnt clean out every car
[2:16:01] Rickets89: @james_neff that was probably mantis
[2:16:08] ZyberFox: But if you're in the apartments, you should use a lot
[2:16:12] stochasticdev: Are Valets free?
[2:16:14] Love4donuts: if you put in a parking thing I bet there would be less valets
[2:16:15] ogjoker88: Houses yoused to have limted space in 2.0
[2:16:16] Xylov: first 20 get a valet service
[2:16:17] james_neff: @Rickets89 yeah definitely, he do be spawning in cars
[2:16:21] Huso833: yeah
[2:16:22] Cyberstoma: actual valet and a full parking lot would be super immersive if you are coming to a crowded area
[2:16:23] RektangleTV: in a 100 person event it probably is needed for voip to work well though @PENTA
[2:16:24] Loremipsum21: There should be like 4-5 in the city, 1 in Sandy, and 1 in Paleto and that's it.
[2:16:25] raldune: That event was a good example of that
[2:16:25] Reznr: Start with a few parking lots and force ppl to open parking lots in their neighbourhood if they want one closer
[2:16:26] Love4donuts: parking proposal I mean
[2:16:26] HiOzone: NODDERS
[2:16:28] Arpia__: Which is crazy, cause the server is full, and so is queue.

[2:16:38] whosBingBong: i'd wish just one time we'd see the curbs filled with cars. Sadge
[2:16:38] robin1904: Valet could possible hinder RP

[2:16:52] anextremeemo: oh
[2:16:53] HeyUdontSay_That1010: takes away a from a lot of RP possibilities like bad parking and such
[2:16:54] Weissest: Houses don't need car storage spots anymore. You can use the garage.
[2:16:56] LoneWitcher: @PENTA while i agree there should be like 2-3 vale, people should not play as valley, not every one has time to play 8h a day
[2:17:01] Oushu: pentawBeef
[2:17:04] xZailious: pentawBeef
