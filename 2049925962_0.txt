[6:00:41] vewybig: but its really temting
[6:00:41] MINPOGGERS: fanny slay33rr
[6:00:45] hinatashoyou10: so 4head is prob not fired too
[6:00:48] Sinewave: It should be basic balancing, civ jobs should be consistent, pay average and be low risk. Crim shit should be either easier or pay much higher but with higher risk.
[6:00:48] masterladyfapper: Fanny
[6:00:56] xx_josh0_xx: he doesn't read chat so it's not meta
[6:00:56] Sinewave: G6 just seems out of whack with everything.
[6:01:00] slay33rr: ohhh whos the main date
[6:01:02] Shaun_Thee_Sheep: vewybig you're edging chat Susge
[6:01:05] benmaui: I wonder if 4head is un fired from g6
[6:01:05] w33h00partner: @HebrewOutlaw rekt

[6:01:45] slay33rr: @hebrewoutlaw cool bro
[6:01:47] Cefiro: @Sinewave its already higher risk, just doesn't pay shit ICANT

[6:02:35] eggnoyolk: BabyYodaSip
[6:02:38] Sinewave: Cefiro Well, it's on a spectrum, a lot of the crim shit isn't super high risk but even then the pay doesn't correlate to the risk.
[6:02:40] Wfbigb93: BabyYodaSip
[6:02:41] otherJ99: 4head's controller
[6:02:42] iKickMyself: hes a balance to 4head
[6:02:49] ind_i_go: 4head money sink
[6:02:51] xflame404: BabyYodaSip
[6:02:54] gremlin282: @HebrewOutlaw true mothers are precious beings so its best not to joke about them :D
[6:03:03] zuckscalulator: @Sinewave no cuz otherwise everyone will be crim if u want the server to be healthy crime needs to pay shit and civs needs to pay more the only thing is you need advantages to being a crim not money, actual benefiets
[6:03:04] blitz__wolf: foheadSTARE das right
[6:03:04] Shaun_Thee_Sheep: brejj
[6:03:05] ardit7ij: 4head catching stays LUL

[6:03:12] britttanylee: 4head takes strays without even being around lmao
[6:03:14] HebrewOutlaw: @gremlin282 hey good point actually

[6:04:07] HebrewOutlaw: @deekoiii I wish ur dad had left himself out because you were raised so well. boom roasted
[6:04:10] tom_TZU: @Garretata 3 hours late, but thanks for the gifted sub bro!!
[6:04:12] Shaun_Thee_Sheep: gremlin282 do you have 7tv??
[6:04:14] Sinewave: zuckscalulator Doesn't work that way, civ should be steady and consistent, not high paying. If the risk is high on crim shit then that's a deterrent - or you put enough effort in to lower the risk.
[6:04:15] Cefiro: @Sinewave yeah, i guess they are trying to find a mid point of balance, but that doesn't explain why they keep boosting G6 while every other work is ass, maybe they want everyone doing G6
[6:04:15] vewybig: guys this only bully muuni zone no 4head bully allowed
[6:04:25] tom_TZU: just realised it
[6:04:34] gremlin282: @Shaun_Thee_Sheep nope

[6:05:16] Sinewave: Cefiro I have to assume it's mostly because their eyes are on getting new content in that being too hyper focused on the balancing but I'm sure it'll work itself out.
