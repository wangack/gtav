[8:44:29] Shadow_x_Sabors: that would have been wild if it was the same Charlie
[8:44:56] Chrysaetos: @Dutch_Tuchd buddy you need to stp talking about things you've seen in other streams in this chat
[8:44:59] Chrysaetos: !meta
[8:44:59] StreamElements: Meta is any information Moosebrother does not know in character. Do not meta in chat. If you want to discuss meta information, please do so in the discord in the #GTA meta. https://discord.gg/mYKrx7AzdJ
[8:45:22] SoIid__: @Chrysaetos HUHH
[8:45:28] Hento: actual Bob issue Sadge
[8:45:52] Dutch_Tuchd: There's no tag saying not to do so and it's not like I was purposely trying to influence Moose with that, just having a convo with another chatter.
[8:46:12] Hento: @Dutch_Tuchd you never meta in RP streams, thats a given
[8:46:17] TheBadkins: no meta NOPERS
[8:46:26] Spikee439: EMS screwing things
[8:46:26] Swiftym8: i keep my meta info to my dm's with moose
[8:46:28] Dutch_Tuchd: a given to you...
[8:46:33] Chrysaetos: @Dutch_Tuchd Its literally metagaming. Take it to a meta chat. let Moose find things out in character
[8:46:36] Bowes0: Meta is for meta chats, don't want it to influence anything
[8:46:37] Hento: @Dutch_Tuchd the entire RP community
[8:46:38] Kaia_32: @Dutch_Tuchd its still meta. Streamers read their chats
[8:46:40] Boccx7: FingerAttack meta
[8:46:47] WorkinRightNow: cant even explain it to him if you wanted to chat theyre the same people who would try to justify the spoilers as not spoilers
[8:46:57] Swiftym8: ACTINUP grave robbers when they get a free gun
[8:47:01] Kaia_32: it doesnt matter why you say it meta is still meta

[8:47:54] TinkeringTurian: PEPW *vague comment*
[8:47:59] Birbado: they used to rp long time ago
[8:48:14] Boccx7: PEPW reddit
[8:48:18] TheBadkins: that keeps things fresh and fun
[8:49:02] Dutch_Tuchd: yes Candii is new to RP, also I don't usually watch RP streams because random people in chat have always spammed essaying at me for having conversations with people in chats.
[8:49:10] Kaia_32: its a good rule of thumb to assume streamers dont want to know anything unless they ask
[8:49:15] Bowes0: nodd
[8:49:25] Boccx7: nodd thats hard
[8:49:26] SaltySnacks20: probably differently in 4.0
[8:49:28] TheBadkins: nodd as a good RPer should
[8:49:29] PLOWINGTHEFIELD: you need to know what thechief1114 did LUL

[8:49:35] thestarsaredown: @Kaia_32 And that if they ask, it's probably rhetorical unless they say it's not
[8:49:35] PLOWINGTHEFIELD: important meta unlocks
[8:49:36] Vikinick: god the boosting was actually so boring and mechanical that it wasn't even worth learning about
[8:49:51] SimonSayz89: it would get boring fast if chat told you everything
[8:49:57] kenic1: essaying
[8:50:08] Hento: it would ruin any genuine interaction
[8:50:18] Chrysaetos: @Dutch_Tuchd I mean, you are essaying KEKW

[8:50:58] Dutch_Tuchd: If you say so, I just have a habit of speaking in more than a single sentence or a couple words.
[8:51:15] WorkinRightNow: @Chrysaetos nah you good keep on chatting dont be scared if his super long and sharp sword we like to type essays sometimes and thats just what we do, one of these days these spams are gonna walk all over you.

[10:30:47] Rayvohs: any ideas on wat tattoos bloom is gonna have? or just going to let lily pick them? @moosebrother
[10:30:59] Kaia_32: the whole idea of south park is to either offend people in a "funny" way or make fun of recent events
[10:31:00] Bowes0: @Rayvohs You want Merp to suffer huh
[10:31:07] Slain0r: @Rayvohs why would he have tattoos he's not a criminal
