[4:47:24] DJ_4point0: Isn't it a brand of microwave meal?
[4:47:25] inus2: its a boxed meal thing with noodles, rice or something + the seasonings where you just basically cook and add ground beef + milk to thicken the sauce
[4:47:28] honor234567: Hamburger meat corn and pasta with cheese
[4:47:32] Barcca: mac and cheese for me

[4:48:42] inus2: the stroganoff one is pretty tasty
[4:49:04] Steambottom: it’s all done on stove top
[4:49:13] Barcca: i've never had hamburger helper, is it good?
[4:49:43] DJ_4point0: I've never had it either, but I imagine it's really salty.
[4:49:53] timbit2015: hamburger helper is decent quick meal for someonewho doesnt cook like me
[4:50:07] inus2: it can be very sodium-intensive, depends on how much of the mix you use
[4:50:24] Steambottom: it’s a very stick on rib type of meal, if that makes sense?
[4:50:30] Redeyes: There is a chicken helper if you dont like or cant eat beef as well
[4:50:33] Barcca: i just remember the commercials with the glove kivaLUL
[4:51:08] Steambottom: sometimes use ground turkey instead of beef

[5:03:52] Anrisacia: This has been so much fun kivaCheer
[5:04:57] Thrath: On the other cook you could try also inputting all 5 below average elements with the two correct ones in the same slots and see if it pumps out average

[5:06:55] Anrisacia: There's only 100,000 possible combinations anyways kivaNotes
[5:07:36] inus2: would just say due to the combinations there isn't enough info to say an element is coarse or not yet but it's worth trying anything to get more info
[5:07:44] Steambottom: does it have to be dirty water?
[5:08:28] Vinkari: @Steambottom Normal water worked at the start but now it has to be dirty water
[5:08:51] Random_Slacker: I think people are assuming its like meth table vs meth lab.. so these stills have like a max quality before you need the new thing
[5:08:55] Random_Slacker: but the new thing isnt here yet
[5:09:53] Vizi797: It kinda makes me think you actually may not have hated doing the meth table stuff from 3.0 lol
[5:09:58] Random_Slacker: yeah I think people are just assuming and stopped at their good recipe, haha
[5:10:24] inus2: mmmm cause rod's assumption is that a specific element is average in a slot, another might be below average in that same slot, etc
[5:10:36] inus2: and not that they might be based on the order they are in, in any slot
[5:11:33] Anrisacia: Did the math, and it would take about 2778 days straight to test all possible combinations when using only one still peepoGiggles

[5:13:02] Vizi797: Everyone's moved on to GTA 6. "Where's Kiva? Oh she's still in the sewers making moonshine" KEKW
[5:13:03] inus2: yeah think that's what he was saying about average being best
[5:13:18] inus2: given every other crim thing has leaked literally instantly to the entire city, if someone had above average people would prob know
[5:13:26] mazzu7000: People have calculated and used the exclusion method to find their maximum quality
[5:14:59] Anrisacia: Statistics and probability courses were the ones I got the highest marks in during university kivaLUL
[5:15:07] minimalsnow: kivaCozy
[5:15:51] imdeatht1: Id say the reason a lot of people think its 130 but its kinda meta/ooc.
[5:15:53] Vizi797: Flip side from Anri, Stats and Probability were my least favorite math classes one of like 2 B's I had in college KEKW
[5:16:05] inus2: yeah was gonna say its ooc math knowledge being used ic kivaLUL
[5:16:10] DJ_4point0: There's probably some algorithm you could follow and max it out in the most efficient way, but that sounds like work.
[5:16:30] uitzui: people have said even if they use the same recipe they still are in a range when selling, like Rod being 125-130 per bottle, so people who have been doing this a lot probably see that their variance and gains near a diminishing point. Even Rod is saying he doesn't have the perfect recipe but his estimate is it might not go that much higher according to his data
[5:16:59] uitzui: so i don't think anyone has a difinitive answer but they are closer
[5:17:39] uitzui: except the meta that Marlo found the perfect recipe but server isn't ready and he broke everything, so everyone is also operating in a not finished playing field

[5:18:00] Madam_Orange: people also assume its like meth and meth tables where there was a ceiling for tables compared to labs
[5:18:29] Thrath: Pretty sure it was overloading the guy with the amount yeah KEKW
[5:18:39] Anrisacia: Yeah most of what I heard was the amount too NODDERS
[5:19:21] inus2: the stars with the sewer guy go wayyyy above 100 and the still you get at 100 is called 'old still' so that prob makes people think there will be a higher-quality still for going beyond average too
[5:19:36] Thrath: It also could just be the variation is only happening because the ceiling is time locked at the moment until either newer ingredients or utilities
[5:19:38] Anrisacia: They would have been the best spreadsheets ever Sadge
[5:19:54] uitzui: i mean regardless of how he broke things i think the assumption that there is more to come with maybe bigger/better stills later is fair . I personally hope people will start cooking stuff in bathtubs at home at some point
[5:20:02] DJ_4point0: If there is a platue in the quality increase then there would be the question of diminishing returns and going for higher quality no longer beinh worth it.
[5:20:03] orangesol: people just haven't unlocked the LL distillery heist yet NODDERS

[5:37:32] uitzui: once Ant hits max rep and there is at least one semi cosistent support person it might be possible to support 15+ stills
[5:38:19] Thrath: Could easily do like 6 and 6 with Ant and Rod
[5:38:21] uitzui: yeah because Rod seems to have no issue in sustaining his 6 right now, so once Ant is 200 rep as well it's at least 12 for those two alone

[6:15:17] Anrisacia: kivanotes
[6:15:18] Madam_Orange: try the same thing, but put the same below average in every other spot?
[6:15:20] Anrisacia: kivaNotes
[6:15:32] Thrath: Same spot add the 4 below average elements and switch the 1st and 2nd slot between the stills
[6:16:47] Thrath: This way you can eliminate up to 4 for their spots
[6:16:57] Anrisacia: Probably leaving mQ where it is would be the best strat to start
[6:17:00] Madam_Orange: if more than one thing changes then you have to test more to see which one is the good one
[6:17:36] NBTyler: catJAM
[6:18:03] Thrath: Could do the last two as the same elements for each still and just work on the first two element slots
[6:18:36] Madam_Orange: pick a below average to just always use, and then pick another to go down the line with? kivaSus
[6:19:53] Scanda4: kivaJammies
[6:20:08] Anrisacia: Simplest way is to now keep mQ where it is, choose 2, 4, and 5 positions to stay the same, and then go through and test 1 position through all 10 options
[6:20:16] uitzui: testing around mQ is valid, especially since another recipe with mQ in 3rd also yielded below average,
[6:20:22] uitzui: yes what Anri is saying
[6:20:23] Thrath: With the route I was thinking with the last two as controlled slots if there is a difference in sales price only two elements are changing so its easier to see which is causing the fluctuation

[6:32:56] uitzui: if you want you could add 2 more stills, i think you can support them by now

[6:33:21] Madam_Orange: whole house gonna be filled with shine at this rate
[6:33:59] TKE_Super_Dave: Unless you plan to be there a while I'd hold off on getting more stills until tomorrow in case someone breaks
[6:34:45] DJ_4point0: @rezaq8 Only played Stardew so I can't really say
[6:35:27] RezaQ8: @DJ_4point0 Oh damn, I always recommend Harvest Moon to people who enjoy Stardew. It is the original after all
