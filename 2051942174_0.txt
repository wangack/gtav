[1:11:59] sterowentUS: i like onx's identity with lots of civ life, a fledgling PD. most people don't realize that to have a great crim environment, you need those things to begin with
[1:12:24] SteinCr: Much better an RP character than a "wrap it up" email
[1:12:25] itsAIKZ: from my own experience playing on the server, the RP has been really really good, i like the slow approach, but we need some crim mechanics for cops/crims NODDERS @GTAWiseGuy
[1:12:54] LoopeeDK: @sterowentUS agreed it seeds the server perfectly to avoid the classic "cop v robbers issue"
[1:12:59] hazelovestacos: I can't wait for motorcycles to come out and bring life to the MC gangs
