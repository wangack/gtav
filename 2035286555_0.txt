[0:45:08] xtylaw: turbo?
[0:45:14] NemisizZ: turbo yeah lol
[0:45:49] NemisizZ: actually, isnt that 15 dollars?
[0:46:23] MistaJingles: no. i paid 3 months ahead for traumz last month and T3 here. other than that i havent paid for anything on twitch
[0:46:50] NinjaTexan: @NemisizZ nah it's 11.99/month
[0:47:48] NemisizZ: @NinjaTexan depends on where you live tbh
[0:48:18] MistaJingles: with the discount last month the 3 t1 subs for traumz was $11.22 but idk why i would get charged again
[0:48:20] NemisizZ: isnt there a transaction history or something on twitch
[0:48:52] ltl_wackman: @NemisizZ https://www.twitch.tv/subscriptions?tab=expired but also like, theres probably another page

[0:52:17] NemisizZ: ahhh
[0:52:28] MistaJingles: i thought they charged me twice
[0:52:33] NemisizZ: weird it didnt reserve it at least

[4:28:32] slorebear: unlock trashbags and those trash picker upper arm things
[4:29:04] EpicHuggles: travpiHmm
[4:29:25] EpicHuggles: travpiLost
[4:29:46] EpicHuggles: i wish i knew what was happening behind the scenes with the NP PD
[4:29:53] EpicHuggles: very bizarre
[4:30:26] epic_smee: @epichuggles i guess they knew that crime will not be big in the beginning . So they start it up very slowly
[4:30:36] epic_smee: What do you want 40 cops for atm tbh
[4:30:47] EpicHuggles: because you need them to get experience and be competent
[4:30:53] epic_smee: To epichuggles
[4:31:40] epic_smee: @epichuggles but currently they can't gather much experience. There is very little crime happening right now
[4:31:44] AverageStudent: 100% back to rule of 4
[4:32:00] AverageStudent: rule of 6 with them in 4 cars in chases is crazy
[4:32:05] EpicHuggles: you have to had the pd first, then add crime. if you do it the other way around then crims farm crime and fuck the economy
[4:32:11] Daslock94: i feel like the number went up so high back when there was massive amount of hold out shoot outs and 99% of the pd was stuck at that scene for potentially hours
[4:32:25] Daslock94: then it never lowered when that wasnt the norm anymore
[4:32:33] Code_J92: That cops have been handicapped it feels like. But I get you don't want them to be to op right out the gate
[4:33:12] epic_smee: @epichuggles crimes really didnt fuck the economy. It was Restaurants and cooking Meth. No number of cops would have made a difference
[4:33:23] UNCLEBUBBA234: was that Jimmy back there at the skate park?
[4:33:36] Daslock94: wasnt there a solid like 2 months where there were hold out style gun fights with rule of 4? back in the meat grinder days
[4:33:39] epic_smee: @epichuggles but in general i agree
[4:34:11] AverageStudent: they do need more rn though. they had 4 in peak NA last night.
[4:34:11] EpicHuggles: WICKED
[4:34:16] Daslock94: WICKED
[4:34:30] AverageStudent: 4 and chatterbox on at the same time isn't enough LUL
[4:34:44] NemisizZ: i wonder which server Eli is going on
[4:34:55] epic_smee: Prodigy most likely
[4:34:56] AverageStudent: Prodigy
[4:35:01] NemisizZ: really
[4:35:08] AverageStudent: he already has tags there
[4:35:08] epic_smee: They retweeted his thingy
[4:35:09] Bulfwyne: aww Sadge
[4:35:12] NemisizZ: ahhh
[4:35:42] AverageStudent: WICKED
[4:35:44] killahawk: lol this song is in bluey lol god i watch to much bluey with the kid lol
[4:35:57] epic_smee: I knew about Sheriff Eli before i knew about rp lol. That shit went so viral
[4:36:31] AverageStudent: He'll be a big draw for sure
[4:36:35] NemisizZ: lol yeah he didnt even have a twitch and then made a channel so ppl could follow him incase he wanted to stream
[4:36:36] Daslock94: i believe in dickheads ability to get this bike out LUL
[4:36:51] EpicHuggles: i just want to watch travpiWIGGLE again Sadge
[4:37:01] Bulfwyne: was kinda hoping Eli would do Onx but oh well, i'll be glad he's rp'ing again, its been years
[4:37:20] NemisizZ: yeah, like how long now, 5-6 years
[4:37:28] epic_smee: If Eli didnt go on a crazy egotrip and played his cards right,he would be pretty big now
[4:37:34] ramboh3: ramp it off the wall maybe?
[4:37:51] ramboh3: need bogg LUL
[4:38:06] coolwhipice: I know how to do it but I won't tell you lol
[4:38:14] NemisizZ: i mean, knowing how ppl talk about things, then i think it should be taken with a grain of salt, but i dunno, never seen the powertrip thing ppl always refer to
[4:38:22] Bulfwyne: idk about a ego trip LUL but Eli was more or less shafted
[4:38:35] Bulfwyne: Timmac still gets flak, and its all from TFRP days
[4:38:39] mariuspure: @NemisizZ he used to ban people from the server if they were not following his rp lol
[4:38:41] Bulfwyne: even whats herface, Proxy
[4:38:46] AverageStudent: headed to prodigy
[4:38:51] Bulfwyne: he's going on prodigy it seems
[4:38:58] NemisizZ: thats kinda what i got to aswell @Bulfwyne
[4:39:10] Jiicknesson: you can hold the "alt"menu up if you mouse over it and move/climp
[4:39:35] NemisizZ: @mariuspure i mean, we seen the same coming from the same people saying that lol which is why i think it should be taken with a grain of salt
[4:39:37] epic_smee: @nemisizz Eli went crazy , but He wasnt the only source of toxicity
[4:39:49] epic_smee: But its 5 years now. Maybe he is more chill
[4:39:50] Bulfwyne: yea Eli was just like how people got mad at Wrangler for actually doing the job of a cop, and he was always straight forward
[4:40:10] epic_smee: @bulfwyne No way thats your take lol
[4:40:12] iTaterpie: put it on the pipe then get on the wall
[4:40:22] ramboh3: nino was stuck here yesterday with a rental car

[4:42:25] AverageStudent: banned the biggest draw
[4:42:40] epic_smee: @slorebear the usual, crims were assholes, cops were assholes and it imploded
[4:42:50] Bulfwyne: Eli was like Wrangler, did his job and was straight forward, and it rubbed people the wrong way, and also the TFRP drama crap that timmac and proxypms still deal with from randos
[4:43:01] Bulfwyne: @AverageStudent yeee
