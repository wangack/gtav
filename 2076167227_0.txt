[4:05:16] EpicHuggles: D:
[4:05:19] akn8iv: you can, if people loved you, you’re approved
[4:05:32] SneakyFoxtrot: Its only three cop characters I can watch. You, Kyle, and Esfand.
[4:05:42] Lizzkhhalifa: dang I didn’t know gunner died):
[4:06:00] DezalbM: i hope you and spaceboy get cop and do patrols together lmao

[4:08:30] slorebear: :O
[4:08:36] packagepeeper: POG
[4:08:38] slorebear: tyler and akridge have been a funny ass combo
[4:08:42] Moonsc: oh shit dank leaks

[4:11:57] Svennoss: ppl probs camped the ppl LUL
[4:11:58] Suvaacc: when the big runs were added
[4:11:59] SkrillQQ: thats prob because people keept staying in the car while handing shit over
[4:11:59] slorebear: maybe the npcs are just too unreliable
[4:12:05] Moonsc: i think people underestimate how fast you can do the small ones now
[4:12:32] Nightbot: All my content is free, but if you would like to support please feel free to sub <3 https://www.twitch.tv/products/travpiper
[4:12:45] Moonsc: only by 10 bucks

[4:13:12] sungwuns: jbtvVibe
[4:14:10] Nydels: 
[4:14:17] Suvaacc: 4head lazy ass literally has like 60k worth of jewelry, soon he will hit 100k and he still wont do the runs LUL
[4:14:19] mukiwa18: pul
[4:14:24] mukiwa18: pulling in some serious speed
[4:15:13] DezalbM: a wow player about that grind life? no way.
[4:15:41] Svennoss: at this point u can just wait till the 5th
[4:15:46] Svennoss: and get a 100% xp increase
[4:16:06] EpicHuggles: i doubt it
[4:16:36] Svennoss: just wait for both honestly
[4:16:38] Suvaacc: if you like grinding, you should start offering jewelry service, would compliment the fannys money one
[4:16:39] Svennoss: lvling is gonna be a joke
[4:17:23] Suvaacc: some people sell jewelry still like for 4-5 per, thats free money, even with small runs
[4:18:04] Suvaacc: small run is 7 per, middle run is 9 per(but hardes, shit value), big run is 12(best value)
[4:18:25] ydw2jameshunter: !graphics
[4:18:35] DezalbM: its also near risk free since no cops come up here
[4:18:51] Suvaacc: since you wake up every NA tsunami, you could snipe the big run every day like mdm guys
[4:19:29] ydw2jameshunter: what is your graphics that u using? its looks like quant v but its look in the same time reshade and what is your game settings
[4:19:44] Deventerwarrior: Future is perfect for that
[4:19:46] Suvaacc: 4head is sleeping by that time anyway

[4:21:21] pliskinx21: Tell em you gonna slap em and give em a 5 -head if he don't stop fucking with blood
[4:21:26] Suvaacc: moonshine seems insane amount of money if you have formula down, cause you can do 1 run with as much as you can carry/car can carry, take like 100 bottles with 1 run, and its mainly all same sandy/paleto places
[4:21:41] slorebear: shoot drakes missile at him he will shape up
[4:21:46] ydw2jameshunter: what is your graphics that u using? its looks like quant v but its look in the same time reshade. and if u can show your in-game settings it will be amazing
[4:23:25] pliskinx21: Got a 4080?
[4:23:42] pliskinx21: Oh shit. Lol my bad
[4:24:01] EpicHuggles: yea most older games are CPU throttled

[4:24:40] mukiwa18: this is bullshit
[4:24:42] EpicHuggles: THE 4090 FAILED US NOOO
[4:24:53] Suvaacc: at least you completed the run
[4:25:21] b2a80: looks like it's everyone
[4:25:26] pliskinx21: Hell yeah.
[4:25:37] b2a80: oh maybe not, but a lot

[6:32:04] Suvaacc: how much you paying per batch to gomer?
[6:32:58] slorebear: 500 i think it was ?
[6:33:21] Nightbot: check out my merch at https://dotexe.com/collections/travpiper
[6:34:31] slorebear: i think thats right
[6:34:47] DezalbM: 600 rolled 500 normal cash, 200 if you help gather ingredients.
[6:35:29] Suvaacc: so you make around 500-550 per batch. 20 batches would be 10k for 1 big delivery job. easy money
[6:36:03] Suvaacc: yeah thats 1k per 8
[6:37:09] Suvaacc: yeah this is mainly worth it only by doing big runs, doing it 1 batch per time would be time waste
[6:46:12] onix146: Susge

[6:52:30] Suvaacc: you could do 1 200 jewelry run at the same time you do moonshine for that extra grinderW
[6:53:46] Suvaacc: jewelry run is 1400 alone and is only  up in sandy an paleto and you see all spots
[6:54:37] thajollypirate: have to not die
[6:54:46] onix146: GrinderW do the hot run then use the car for the moonshine deliveries
[6:54:49] Suvaacc: yeah i mean only when you hve it, like your house is full of it
