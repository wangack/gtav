[1:09:57] recklessgallifreyan: Unless you are Jerry Kappa
[1:10:18] OnyxSpartanII: @mystic_drewman you want IRL or on ONX?
[1:10:22] Silentfaythe: Magistrates USUALLY handle administrative tasks and lesser hearings, like Traffic Court or something like that.
[1:11:00] mystic_drewman: @onyxspartanii irl I guess the server is no different I think lol
[1:11:26] OnyxSpartanII: well IRL there is no supreme justice in the US, it's just justices, judges, and magistrates
[1:11:47] mystic_drewman: Ok awesome thanks
[1:11:50] OnyxSpartanII: in the federal system the only justices are the judges on the supreme court
[1:12:27] mystic_drewman: That what was confusing me. I think 😆
[1:12:40] Silentfaythe: on a state level.....it varies by state. Some of them are WEIRD in how they break their courts down.
[1:12:52] OnyxSpartanII: KEKW yep
[1:13:13] mystic_drewman: Wv and fla seem standard-ish lol
[1:13:26] OnyxSpartanII: like NY state's highest court is the Court of Appeals, not the NY Supreme Court
[1:13:33] SocialistTrucker: pentawBlock
[1:13:57] Silentfaythe: You'll find more conformity than outliers in state court organization, but when there is deviation, it's WEIRD.
[1:14:20] mystic_drewman: That makes sense I guess. Can you take an appeal verdict to Supreme court?
[1:14:42] OnyxSpartanII: well the NY supreme court is just a regular trial court
[1:14:53] mystic_drewman: Oohh
[1:14:57] OnyxSpartanII: so appeals would be heard above it
[1:15:12] mystic_drewman: Ah ok I see
[1:15:13] OnyxSpartanII: it has a special appellate division
[1:15:34] Kentuckybluegrass: as a New Yorker, I hate how we deviate from the standard format of courts lol
[1:16:20] Silentfaythe: Ok, that's complicated: As I understand it, if a state law has any kind of impact on federal law / constitutional or rights implications, you can make a special appeal AFTER the ruling of the State's highest court to the federal supreme court that they can choose to take or not.
[1:16:38] OnyxSpartanII: oh sure, yeah, if you're talking about appealing above a state's court system to the federal system
[1:16:48] Silentfaythe: When it comes to state specific laws that end in the state and have no federal or rights implications, highest state court slaps the mar.
[1:17:24] mystic_drewman: Yeah they will take jurisdiction

[5:26:18] d0ubleDang: what was going on at the cemetary?
[5:27:43] AngelWolfwood: digging graves
[5:28:43] SilentRequiem94: Is it fitting that I could see Nolan sitting on a bench in the graveyard at night? Spooking the crap out of anyone grave robbing or otherwise
[5:30:29] SilentRequiem94: Oh god another tragic backstory
[5:35:15] Livery: Hey man
[5:35:21] TPLivewire: Especially coming from the story we are coming from
[5:35:26] rachelkachel: if you don't come into the city with a tragic backstory you'll quickly acquire one
[5:35:28] SilentRequiem94: There was zo
[5:35:32] OnyxSpartanII: a nuclear strike is no walk in the park
[5:36:10] Livery: @SilentRequiem94 I dont think I have ever been on a server where someone has not had some sort of tragic/badass/john wick backstory. What happened to being a blue collar farmer who just became a cop?
[5:37:28] SilentRequiem94: @livery Exactly. Tragic stories are great and all but there is a point where they are repeating and the individuality of the character is lost
[5:37:42] TPLivewire: One of my characters has a tragic back story, one of my characters had a wack backstory that actually developed while playing on the server, then I have a normie run of your mill happy healthy life and coming up
[5:38:28] Livery: @SilentRequiem94 indeed its kinda old. I have been rping for god knows how long back on san adreas when it was a text only thing. And still have yet to find someone craft a unqiue non criminal story.
[5:39:25] Livery: @TPLivewire thats understandable but as long as your not "oh im gonna make all my characters bad ass" I think that is when you then start adding value as a role player
[5:42:58] TPLivewire: @TPLivewire You definitely need to build faults into your characters, whether they develop naturally or you go into it with them.
[5:43:05] OnyxSpartanII: @Livery be the change you want to see in the world occamSmile
[5:43:14] SilentRequiem94: Dave. Dave from accounting. Never married, no kids, just was never his thing. He is charismatic, hoot of office parties.
