[5:11:54] Crustyfoxen: coffee with a shot of lemon juice
[5:11:56] flatmilkstain: I get headaches if I DONT drink coffee LUL but I think thats just a caffeine addiction
[5:12:11] 007Nightfire: having a shortage of caffeine can give you headache, but that means you should drink less coffee during the week LUL
[5:12:17] kunravong: Caffeine opens blood vessels, helps headaches
[5:12:21] Jake_IRL: caffeine is used in migraine pain relievers
[5:12:28] BluGiant: Nerdge Consuming caffeine, which narrows the vessels, can ease or even reverse some headache pain. Ironically, a sudden lack of daily caffeine can cause a headache. It triggers a series of events that also lead to dilated blood vessels, and thus to headache pain. Nerdge
[5:12:37] wenngren: you lose your job right if you catch a felony?
[5:12:44] VerityNS: I mean would be awesome getting to fly the Cargobob and pick up cars in the terrain that have got stuck

[5:19:51] qweet_: that
[5:19:56] Rexasb8: they’re not a risk *yet*. It’s likely no one has made it to the money bag meta progress yet
[5:20:13] Prollos: you know what id love, repos, you unlock it at a certain level as a trusted person and you deliver to someone else with the chance the person (npc) attacks you KEKW
[5:20:19] qweet_: maybe tow trucks could have bigger job like repairing 3-4 cars idk from a car wreck
[5:20:24] Rynk1e: Could you put a manual transmission in with different parts?
[5:20:25] kaitoJD: they prob don't want new/vet duo to "power level" the new guy's rep so they put in limitations

[5:22:35] vicvega00: That's one of the really fun things to watch on cop rp is the giant ensemble. Some the best moment were in the wave meetings

[5:24:56] Amnesty_SayGen: What's the difference between NoPixel and ONX?
[5:24:56] Rexasb8: @nealee if you’re really worried about it, start as a homeless character. someone who can “disappear” without a trace for when you get settled in. it’ll be easier for your main character this way

[5:29:31] Rexasb8: @nealee I’ve done roleplay of all sorts for years. a disposable character always helps you get a leg in and you can experiment with all kinds of personalities and quirks since “crazy homeless person” is always a viable role
