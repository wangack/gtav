[1:53:24] TropicalToucan: okay
[1:53:25] Niktory: remember when arush had the positives and negatives for every member , good times
[1:53:40] EKANA_STONE: Larry was tryna give clean and they were like just save it for next week LUL
[1:53:55] TropicalToucan: How much % kickback do you get for giving clean cash ?
[1:54:06] Tamzim: yuno aswell
[1:54:21] jongonzalez2010: yuno balling
[1:54:39] watermelontoboggan: Larry does the exact same shit, his stuff just isn't in the crew house
[1:54:40] bobbygeeeeee: bobbygeeeeee subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 34 months, currently on a 34 month streak! 
[1:54:46] cochorus: so it needs to be stated clearly. contribute your clean cash to the pile and track that in the compute
[1:55:00] watermelontoboggan: *as Lang
[1:55:19] wundo: the wording just doesnt make sense. why would tracking something change the fact that its a donation
[1:55:24] lvlagg: well what has yuno contributed?
[1:55:27] JessCee7: Yeah never been mentioned
[1:55:31] EKANA_STONE: Like Lang thinks its easy to understand, but it ain't as clear as he thinks it is
[1:55:31] olrawwks: someone from the group is exempted from all of this wonder why? LUL
[1:55:40] Niktory: might as well just make a crew cut for both avenues
[1:55:44] civlaz: KEKW
[1:55:48] Oni_mara: was it tho KEKW ion think it was
[1:55:56] TropicalToucan: So if you give 100K what % kickback do you get from that though
[1:55:59] Niljapoli: Lang is contradicting himself so much
[1:56:06] JessCee7: Narrator: It wasn’t
[1:56:06] Tydorz: common sense is rare these days harry lol
[1:56:09] lvlagg: lang is delusional af too
[1:56:17] EKANA_STONE: I got a birds eye view from a meta perspective and i have a hard time understanding the nuances LUL
[1:56:18] KrisCat: @wundo b/c they agreed that donating w/o getting anything in return could lead to ppl throwing in their face down the line how much they donated w/ nothing in return.
[1:56:20] toastypinky: time to start cleaning the kitchen
[1:56:20] TropicalToucan: I feel like no one has said the % of clean cash you get kickback for LUL
[1:56:35] jongonzalez2010: yuno
[1:56:37] Spartoriius: o7 Yuno?
[1:56:48] msdeell: how are contributing
[1:56:49] JessCee7: What’s the point of a kick back on clean money LUL
[1:56:54] wundo: @KrisCat that part makes sense. but when he says he doesnt like donations that could easily be misunderstood
[1:56:56] lvlagg: why no one brings up yuno in this convo? LUL
[1:57:07] Spartoriius: @lvlagg hes immune i guess
[1:57:08] Niktory: the up and down debt was so good , cause then , say u are up 100k u could get priority for things
[1:57:11] apache78: Look at those goalposts move. Whew! LUL
[1:57:18] JessCee7: Yeah Yuno5k per week
[1:57:25] Oni_mara: Gigi spitting facts
[1:57:27] EKANA_STONE: @wundo Exactly, Larry woulda gave that cash if all he needed to do was say how he got it
[1:57:29] rejpendeskejp: so yuno gives 200k for new house? EZ
[1:57:32] KrisCat: @wundo sure, but that's what gigi just brought up, ppl misunderstoof that.
[1:57:39] KrisCat: *misunderstood
[1:57:54] lvlagg: @spartoriius ye they will bring up yuno and lang would be like hes our computer guy, well marty could be that as well very easily LUL
[1:57:55] jongonzalez2010: yuno
[1:57:59] 4nics: yuno has brought in plenty

[1:58:02] Spartoriius: @lvlagg yea

[1:58:31] wundo: you need to spell this shit out to people LUL
[1:58:35] colloquyt: they’re just looking for a reason to be annoyed, not even problem solving

[1:59:10] DoctorLAW590: there it is
[1:59:11] rejpendeskejp: @TropicalToucan he doesn't bring much in the crew, so 200k could be his thing to bring
[1:59:13] jongonzalez2010: there you go
[1:59:13] lvlagg: @grandtreasurerofhell ye marty has the same value, lang is just biased
