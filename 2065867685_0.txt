[4:22:34] cabers01: well son you got off lucky i count 74 joints here, go have fun
[4:22:35] Zac_NZ: if he had history you probably had it
[4:22:36] therealslimkty: @lundo2fundo hey lundo <3 kyleisCute kyleisLove
[4:22:38] th3killin: more raids are for the plugs
[4:22:43] MisterTohru: 13 joints, an illegal gun, and a bunch of burner phones? yeah depends where. bumfuck Ohio that’s a raid
[4:22:44] Linarino: at least make it20 😭
[4:22:44] Lemmingify: NODDERS Clap
[4:22:46] newmeta44: !monopolu
[4:22:46] aathrawn: It was interesting to see
[4:22:46] Ele_Underscore: I'm curious where the number 75 came from for the joints
[4:22:46] jasoncookuk: it furthers the story NODDERS
[4:22:48] Seetherrr: @badonkaboots5 definitely not for weed other than very large amouns
[4:22:48] newmeta44: !monopoly
[4:22:49] Gadn: 75 joints is probably more than 10 plants, so kinda high Shruge
[4:22:51] Vogels: NODDERS
[4:22:51] newmeta44: Susge
[4:22:52] slip_slop: shit has to start somewhere NODDERS
[4:22:52] Rikigus: NODDERS yeah
[4:22:53] packofmisfits: 75 Is a lil silly ngl
[4:22:54] ezeref_27: It got the fear of wrangler into some crims at least NODDERS
[4:22:54] fivekings__: @PENTA the guilty plea feels good lmao
[4:22:54] aathrawn: been awhile
[4:22:56] azure404: needs to be lowered Susge
[4:22:57] memerdub024: that's an insane threshold for felonyt
[4:22:58] slurmy: yeah that should be lowered
[4:22:58] OtterFightingClub: who walks around with 75 jhoints??
[4:22:59] taeped: @PENTA do you think 75 is too high?
[4:23:00] ApathyEmbodied: @Ele_Underscore Probably preliminary values?
[4:23:01] xxpops: that's a quarter pound of weed
[4:23:06] AntleredCormorant: IRL weed's been legal in the California this game setting is based on for almost a decade so...
[4:23:08] packofmisfits: yeah
[4:23:10] Oppositeness: @therealslimkty make sure you keep asking kyle for sonic, he'll cave eventually
[4:23:12] aathrawn: good to know the limit
[4:23:19] SpitefuI: unless those delivery bags of weed are a lot
[4:23:20] xxpops: 75 is around a quarter pound if grams are lil over a gram
[4:23:20] Gunman_Inc: @Oppositeness PEPW sure
[4:23:24] Oppositeness: PEPW
[4:23:25] tigerpapa9: Does the PD IC know how many joints you get from a brick?
[4:23:25] BluntAgent: @AntleredCormorant and in game the US constitution isnt recognized so
[4:23:27] cabers01: stay the FUCK outside
[4:23:30] ezeref_27: @AntleredCormorant BatChest WOW WEED IS LEGAL IRL THATS SO Pog
[4:23:35] notsonew: Who would TAKE 75 joints out?
[4:23:36] i_want_golden_kappa: @PENTA You can get around 3-4 joints per eighth so 75 joints is ridiculously high for a felony amount lol
[4:23:37] dnabb8436: @Ele_Underscore I think they figured 75 joints equals 75 grams which makes sense but it should be layered more
[4:23:37] therealslimkty: @Oppositeness thank you for your support, i think the next one is day 58 of asking. he's gotta break eventually Prayge
[4:23:37] packofmisfits: NODDERS
[4:23:39] GT_Alex74: France they can keep you on hold for 72h, and even more if it's related to drug trafficking or terrorism
[4:23:41] RSMatticus: delivery is 10 pounds
[4:23:42] Bruh_17_: imo, 13 rolled up joints and 500 dollars cash is def intent and should get a warrant signed for more evidence of distribution NODDERS
[4:23:43] General_Terrain: took forever
[4:23:46] OtterFightingClub: uh oh
[4:23:46] cardiacschlerosis: deleted

[4:23:50] DourDoombrow: hey good policing there wrangie
[4:23:50] aathrawn: that number needs to be lowered
[4:23:51] bugginpuppies: oh I think if he collected his seized items it might have fucked him
[4:23:53] Loremipsum21: Did Wrangler give him Wrangler's keys instead?
[4:23:55] melomaniacjh: keys gone PEPW
[4:23:56] Zaaltyr: over 1 oz should be tbh
[4:23:57] Rem753: you scuffed em
[4:24:00] aathrawn: the bag is gone
[4:24:00] Seetherrr: @notsonew exactly, no one is taking 75 out and if someone is selling that much they just sell the 100g bag
[4:24:03] General_Terrain: that sucks FeelsBadMan
[4:24:04] skunkinap: it took me like 45 minutes to sell 20 joints today
[4:24:06] GillianTheRed: watercooler?
