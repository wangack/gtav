[0:37:34] gostonko: ObamaBinDroning he got sick an hour in ObamaBinDroning
[0:37:49] kidsuper05: @ninjat_rexarmy the thing is the director said the first season took almost 6-7 years to make and they made the following seasons in a much lesser time
[0:38:11] gostonko: damn i missed some cracked drama huh
[0:38:19] ninjat_rexarmy: @kidsuper05 yeah and it shows imo
[0:38:22] kidsuper05: They also wanted to follow the theme of Fargo of every season being standalone so the same cast was not an option

[0:39:02] kidsuper05: the first season of Fargo is a masterpiece
[0:39:23] kidsuper05: @ninjat_rexarmy have you watched The Bear?
[0:39:55] ninjat_rexarmy: @kidsuper05 no, is it similar to TD?
[0:40:15] kidsuper05: @ninjat_rexarmy ohh brother I envy you, no it’s about a chef
[0:40:20] zangdahrr: @ninjat_rexarmy i found you a little harsch, Nic Pizzolatto  couldnt do better than s1 and the reste a ok. The last one is garbage coz they changed Nic to some unknown Issa lopez who never made anything remembered

[0:44:31] kidsuper05: like I see all these amazing reviews about it
[0:44:34] buddhaPJS: someone needs to herd the cats
[0:44:40] kidsuper05: I just can’t see the hype
[0:44:52] orange51611: well the main thing is that all of the characters can just fuck off to a private island somewhere and live in luxury but they choose to seek dad's approval
[0:45:00] kidsuper05: thank god I’m not the only one
[0:45:12] rjw250: @kidsuper05 martywas the glue of gg

[0:45:16] zangdahrr: @kidsuper05 i'm sure more than 50% of viewers got addicted coz they hate the rich LUL
[0:45:22] orange51611: it can make for a fun story but it gets very repetitive. the best aspect of the show is the unhinged shit the characters say

[0:47:46] HockeyPizzaOreos: glad you’re feeing better fanfL
[0:47:53] carrioncorps: you need one person as a puppet leader, and then a council that pulls the strings behind the scenes, basically a government Kappa
[0:47:57] zangdahrr: i feel like nobody wants to lead but they don't want other to lead to
[0:47:59] Celascion: ming is more dictator leadership than collaborative leadership

[3:42:42] Mundosaysyourfired: not really thery made guns very rare this time around and the consequences very severe to be caught with one
[3:42:43] o_frenchfries_o: I think what kept gg alive is that the people in the gang had mechanical skills and rp together wich is strong combination

[3:44:09] CopperKat: Crime without conflict between groups is tough. But if you were to do it with any group that isn’t going to be all ego and all progression racing it’s 4head and co
[3:44:10] jay_jaymann: yea that’s because your gut is usually correct when you are as good at reading people as you are.
[3:44:11] BlackHorizon7: have to be atleast 3 big dogs

[3:44:25] LePtitGrec75: Do you think 4head and Ming would do a good duo lead ?
[3:44:26] 1kaizen9: @luke_banks bro why you hating?
[3:44:28] VenancioVitor: AK being a advisor not a leader would be a good ideia tbh

[3:46:41] padrektt: advisor AK mhm
[3:46:45] el_dia8l0: When you showed up as Leslie during eves day off was awesome lol
[3:46:49] CopperKat: Let’s be honest though if you were ever gonna go all in on a crim group it would be the one that dresses up as trash bags to rob people barbSkillissue
[3:46:49] gbriggs33: it’s like eating at a restaurant you’ve worked at for a while… you don’t care for the food anymore haha
[3:46:51] ejstanding: Where is the AK that shot his superior in the face by accident. that is the AK we all miss and love
[3:46:57] meego0o: if AK leads a gang its drain gang and not gg2.0 SeemsGood
[3:46:58] RU8H: mhm

[3:47:08] mokoto05: true

[3:47:15] TheDev97: moldable is the key word for you, makes sense
[3:47:23] TheDev97: mhm
[3:47:25] AloofMango: unknow member-member dynamics
[3:47:26] dark16sider: Weirdest RP u have seen as an admin God mode?
[3:47:29] CopperKat: But you don’t wanna lead and mold a whole group so maybe it’s better that they’re already a tight group
[3:47:31] Sylverphyre: I think that's the problem with NP 4.0 being a continuation of 3.0 timeline rather than a full reset
[3:47:38] luke_banks: even fanny is having trouble mixing with the tight knit ex gg group
[3:47:40] borroz755: do you ever get into issues being an admin who plays in the server?
[3:47:50] tarwe: „i dont want to“ is good enough of a reason tbh
[3:47:53] genrol: the minions
[3:47:54] 68CUDAHHH: Don’t say the L word. Sadge.
[3:47:56] 818kyle: true
[3:47:57] santilloo88: Is that true tho, different perspectives from a great mind
[3:48:01] Terrozer: preying on the weak and friendless mwahahaha
[3:48:08] padrektt: and you even led the best racing crew this city has ever seen
[3:48:10] jay_jaymann: yea it’s a good approach to assist people in building their role play
[3:48:12] santilloo88: Tru
[3:48:12] 1kaizen9: @luke_banks thats a lie bro
[3:48:14] mokoto05: facts
[3:48:16] kleric1: i like what 4head is building with the new "random" weed sellers , cool stuff with new people
[3:48:17] Fugeki: leslie died Sadge
[3:48:18] SamEatsALot: it must be quite lonely for people who dont find groups like these
[3:48:22] CopperKat: You don’t have time to build people like that up anyways though so maybe a group that’s already ready is ok?
[3:48:26] nosebeersx: i think a full wipe would have been cool.
[3:48:26] Lartigau: but at the same time if you have unresolved issues from 5 years ago, it's destined to fail
[3:48:30] meego0o: but they are also all best friends too

[3:48:35] bluddee: I was surprised how long everyone stayed spread out for at the start of the server before falling back into their old groups of friends.
[3:48:37] nba_throatgoat: Aware Hazel incident
[3:48:41] god7021: and to be fair, he did
[3:48:41] realitijd24: 4head always been like that same as ming
[3:48:45] brutalmoineau: one of your MANY faults
[3:48:59] AWC_Tobi: 4head knows half the city at this point LUL
[3:49:02] Sylverphyre: Do you think 4.0 being a continuation of 3.0 timeline instead of a reset makes it harder also?
[3:49:03] z_xk_k: Problem is that the new people don't mesh as well with the rest of the people so they fall back in contacting their previous connections cause it's more comfortable @Nidas
[3:49:12] CopperKat: Yeah
[3:49:24] spolito12: Which work great with Eve and Nacy!
[3:49:30] FuddelDuddel: We've seen how difficult it was to get AK up to speed after the weekend hiatus what with so many different viewpoints and happenings. If he isn't around regularly, it'll have to happen againn & again & becomes a hassle.
[3:49:33] iZeeMo: 4head just loves to hang around the city and RP more than anything else and I think there should be more people like that
[3:49:35] 911_raj: Now half city is his boys
[3:49:36] jay_jaymann: yeah it keeps the server fresh and promotes new blood
[3:49:36] theastonshuffle: i watch 4head and GG for a long time and i can tell that they change a lot on that way, is really good to be seeing people trying to see both sides of problems and situations and discussing about that, not just doing random shit follow they wants
[3:49:39] Lartigau: @z_xk_k 4sure, but at the same time, the more time you spent with old friends is less time you have to interact with new people
[3:49:43] vision1390: cerberus wont work cause buddha is taking it over with luci and gege. think leslie might have to stick with besties
[3:49:48] jinxedluck: having everything being yoinkable kinda sucks for this
[3:49:52] CopperKat: A bigger group might allow you guys to take in more random people because they won’t need to have access to the main property
[3:49:54] Dentvis: @vision1390 maaaaan
[3:49:55] santilloo88: 4head is a master.
[3:49:58] santilloo88: Hes RP

[3:51:01] RU8H: AK = Nidas = Leslie checks out mhm
[3:51:03] Blacklisted_: Who is Leslie LUL
[3:51:06] bonedead: yeah leslie definitely gotta stick with the besties
[3:51:13] Zartation: he was Leslie this whole time?!
[3:51:14] guygavin: Omegalul
[3:51:14] jay_jaymann: lol it’s not a rerun with new actors
[3:51:15] bluddee: Thats csome valuable info, dont laugh at him
[3:51:15] z_xk_k: xQc talked about this. He used and still does, to hang out with new people constantly. But the chat calling them leeches cause they're smaller/unknown streamers.. So he said it explicitly he feels more comfortable with Ramee/K ect just to avoid the chat cancer @Nidas
[3:51:16] Fugeki: honestly those type of chatters I love shits too cooked it makes it so funny
[3:51:17] Popovzky: cerberus = buddha KEKW
[3:51:20] TheDev97: LUL
[3:51:21] samuraid01: mhm never a truer word spoken
[3:51:29] god7021: I think 4head has a very good impression of how to RP and how to create RP situations which in turn become good content
[3:51:29] buddhaPJS: that was like a doris message
[3:51:35] santilloo88: xQc talked about this. He used and still does, to hang out with new people constantly. But the chat calling them leeches cause they're smaller/unknown streamers.. So he said it explicitly he feels more comfortable with Ramee/K ect just to avoid the chat cancer
[3:51:36] CopperKat: One issue with 4.0 is the properties holding so much value so it’s hard to take in random people and give them a chance when they need access to the house. A bigger group might let you try out random people while keeping the main house secure
[3:51:37] rivyaso: wait is that hazel ?
[3:51:38] 1412A: essaying
[3:51:42] Hotkiki: remember vasily talked to everyone he saw and leslie lost his mind over it
[3:52:01] GoutOfWar: jonbDenzel
[3:52:03] jay_jaymann: yes all very experienced
[3:52:06] Zartation: Deanie Weenie Sadge
[3:52:20] SamEatsALot: And now you are chasing that type of group understanding
[3:52:20] zzZoolex: i miss dean Sadge
[3:52:22] Phoenix__08: thats how ming juliand jack and fanny are tbh
[3:52:23] Meltock: you guys would just have minor squabbles
[3:52:25] emmy_saurus: i miss dean
[3:52:27] Zartation: just rolling around throwing money at the poors
[3:52:29] etopplol: god, i wish i knew that those were the golden days
[3:52:29] padrektt: main disagreements were on who was richer LUL
[3:52:35] Wordbeast: only thing you guys had to worry about was Harry killing someone in the company lol
[3:52:39] santilloo88: Try to learn 2head is a roadbump
[3:52:41] devilmaycrybaby8: But still it will be something new right
[3:52:41] The_Orange_Flash: yall had to manufacture drama I remember some funny ass shit in that group
[3:52:43] Ererior: ye and if you disagreed about something, u just went to play ingevar for 6 months
[3:52:45] CanuckDynasty: @copperkat but that also brings RP the fall outs etc
[3:52:45] robot_pirates: @copperkat there are plenty of ways around that, just look at Buddha's current group.   Most of those guys don't have keys
[3:52:53] gurditn: Disagreements was content
[3:52:53] beean1985: Those were some good times!! that arc was insane!
[3:52:55] santilloo88: Nah mean
[3:52:59] The_Northern_Monkey: I would like to see a server iterration where no one could play previous characters, nor form old groups. Just to see how things would develop. New friendships and what not.
[3:53:00] Henta1b0i: get new tattoos
[3:53:00] vayubam: do think not disagreeing with people and always being in sync one another is necessarily good for the roleplay
[3:53:01] StreamElements: Don't forget to resub Ogey https://www.twitch.tv/subs/nidas
[3:53:02] Beafour: Also, the RPers you are hanging with now likes to argue in character, create some drama as long as it doesnt leak into IRL
[3:53:05] nosebeersx: it feels weird that there isn't like someone like dean in the city. Like a dev that is driving roleplay in some sense.
[3:53:09] CopperKat: The properties being so fragile also makes people more inclined towards folks they trust
[3:53:10] god7021: the context of meeting regarding business decisions and meetings regarding who to shoot or not shoot are also very different from eachother
[3:53:17] BerryG_333: Conflict RP has its place but requires a special kinda character to make it enjoyable on both sides
[3:53:20] jay_jaymann: it was comedy gold, what do you want burger bitch still cracks me up
[3:53:24] Lartigau: @Beafour do you think that is even possible?
[3:53:29] evaitis: i mean you had a good experience previously and you just want to have more of that exp mhm sounds logical
[3:53:30] iZeeMo: it’s not unfair it’s your way to see things, it’s not bad to see it that way I think
[3:53:38] 38antsy: fundamental
[3:53:39] Henta1b0i: META: senior buns < burger shot
[3:53:40] Noelzly: would be great to see ingvar and lang butt heads some day, conflict between them would be gold LUL
[3:53:47] LePtitGrec75: @berryg_333 4head is the master of this kind of RP. He makes RP out of nothing
[3:53:51] Beafour: @Lartigau They are showing that it is :p THey are all friends IRL, only the IG characters are having a beef
[3:53:52] Celascion: personality clashes NODDERS
[3:53:54] NebelKop: i like internal conflict but not if it goes in circles mhm
[3:54:01] Sword_Scream: There's disagreements that are irreconcilable
[3:54:03] CopperKat: Yeah conflicts on decisions are easy compared to personality clashes
[3:54:04] god7021: @LePtitGrec75 this for sure
[3:54:08] Mirphys: @Henta1b0i don't do murder eat a burger
[3:54:24] Beafour: @Lartigau Its only weirdo chatters that tries to take it out of the game and being insanely parasocial
[3:54:26] bahartin: Yea everyone involved can be direct with eachother
[3:54:27] bonedead: cuttin through the BS
[3:54:28] mokoto05: KWKE
[3:54:33] jaycedace00: different character traits
[3:54:35] CopperKat: Decisions are fun to argue over, but actual feelings and shit are not fun
[3:54:35] argonzzzzz: ooohh i memba
[3:54:37] mokoto05: yap
[3:54:39] jay_jaymann: except getting lang to pay for something lol
[3:54:41] pramz02: was it like that from the start?
[3:54:44] santilloo88: Im/we/chat is just chatting right now. Love it
[3:54:48] Lartigau: @Beafour I understand your perspective, but they are not "real friends" irl, they dont even live in the same city.
[3:54:54] nosebeersx: its because you guys had clear goals, so like anything stopping that even for a second felt like it was just dragging for no reason
[3:55:04] muskin6: What i think happened betwwen fanny and 4head they wants to be respected by dont wants to give respect
[3:55:08] realitijd24: goals and structure needed
[3:55:09] Lartigau: And some times if you are not mature enough it will leak
[3:55:23] thegang_o7: Can't wait for ak and lang to clash 1 day
[3:55:30] AloofMango: and 4head too you forgot him meechGiggle
[3:55:30] jay_jaymann: it’s different and that must be refreshing and also daunting
[3:55:33] god7021: i think this stems from different goals within the group tbh
[3:55:36] z_xk_k: It's not something you can "try" and if it doesn't work, just go back.
[3:55:37] NebelKop: yeah... the group is very refreshing
[3:55:47] Beafour: @Lartigau I guess you are one of the weirdos, thinking you know what they are up to IRL. They are only speaking positively about eachother OOC
[3:55:50] Ast3r____: The way the city works kinda forces you to expand tho
[3:55:52] OniStringer: Its nice seeing a lot of the groups kind of switch it up in gneral . its cool
[3:55:57] sharky_00_: yep
[3:56:01] trolling_andykekw: someone could JP out cuh amongst the new people
[3:56:05] skyyPIE: Yeah even in a corporation and expansion/merger can fuck everything up if HR isn't on top of everything
[3:56:05] jay_jaymann: Nodders
[3:56:08] Lartigau: @Beafour lolz, nah im just thinking hipotethicly my guy
[3:56:09] Sword_Scream: Expansions need to be really well defined. And the people who are beigh brought in needs to understand the dynamic. You won't be everyones best friend. Which is also sometimes tough when the newcomers have relations with some members ahead of time
[3:56:13] santilloo88: @thegang_o7 Wait is the key, or not, who knows
[3:56:21] Lartigau: i would be able to separete it, im thinking about myself
[3:56:28] Lartigau: wouldnt*
[3:56:34] Drexun: thats why the multiple store fronts and warehouse is the best choice, so you can separate each area into business, heists and whatever else
[3:56:37] CopperKat: I think the expansion has more to do with server mechanics to be honest. You guys aren’t racing for progress but the BTC gate keeping all crime just makes it tedious to progress without a bigger group
[3:56:38] AloofMango: @santilloo88 different timezones
[3:56:43] itshtml: ignored
[3:56:47] Kikobri_: maaaaan
[3:56:47] Dentvis: donoWall
[3:56:48] 38antsy: donoWall
[3:56:48] coolwhipfire: donowall
[3:56:50] Izy7: at least you tried
[3:56:53] GenKai_Hiei: donowall
[3:56:54] nosebeersx: what copper said is kinda spot on
[3:56:55] Beafour: @Lartigau Sure
[3:56:58] 38antsy: hey at least you tried
[3:57:03] santilloo88: @AloofMango Different minds nidasRLY
[3:57:04] pukuotukas666: ❤️ 💛 💜 🤎 🖤 drainGang 💜 🖤 🤍 💙 💛 love from drain gang
[3:57:06] 911_raj: Copium
[3:57:15] ardit7ij: The best way is to create the structure / Leadership and they vote in 1 by 1 who to invite
[3:57:18] NebelKop: but at the same time more people means less grind and people can actually focus on building something mhm
[3:57:20] LePtitGrec75: What’s your thought on the success of the group? Will it happen or it wont?
[3:57:20] bahartin: quadruple skull fit goes too hard
[3:57:29] rivyaso: where do you think AK gonna be if it didnt workout for him in the new group ?
[3:57:34] rockstrmental1ty: one key potential issue I noticed that I don't think was addressed yet is the difference in ambition levels amongst group members. I think people like ming and future want to do whatever it takes to gain power in the city wheras 4head and others are content how things are
[3:57:43] Dentvis: deadass
[3:57:43] bahartin: QUAD ☠️ SKULLS
[3:57:45] iKickMyself: mrbongLUL
[3:57:45] Meltock: is there a hat with a skull on it
[3:57:52] CopperKat: Yeah I see it more as more hands make lighter work when it comes to GPU crap. So you guys can have more time for fun RP
[3:57:52] skyyPIE: Just need those skull PJ pants if they still have them
[3:57:56] rivyaso: oh shit
[3:57:57] senlash: ratboi Prayge
[3:58:01] nosebeersx: cowboy hat with that fit would go so hard
[3:58:04] Ererior: variety year!?
[3:58:06] jay_jaymann: it’s easier to create a formula for a smaller group due to less variables
[3:58:08] fraudulnt: would you ever consider bringing leslie back and dabbling with the old bois? @Nidas
[3:58:11] DLan19: whats the perma condition for AK
[3:58:14] rivyaso: i mean fair like its hard to rebuild from 0 at this point
[3:58:19] Dentvis: bálatro stream Pog
[3:58:24] senlash: don't be silly Ererior Smokge
[3:58:24] 68CUDAHHH: Has Ingevar ran into @nikez cop character yet?
[3:58:28] bndzor: if it doesnt work out he will just ban the other guys
[3:58:35] Terrozer: u been enjoying phase 2?
[3:58:43] bahartin: mhm
[3:58:44] wadebyjamesjuh: Is the new cop char possible?
[3:58:45] Fishnet83: mhm
[3:58:48] rivyaso: @bndzor LMFAOOOOOOOO
[3:58:48] bluddee: Gotta be some baby games out there ya havent tried yet.

[3:58:54] coolwhipfire: great option
[3:58:55] NebelKop: mhm send them to Zelda
[3:58:57] sansxietyy: new group ?
[3:59:07] Nvar: Time for Leslie Lingberg to return, and control these streets!
[3:59:09] nosebeersx: AK has been great though so far
[3:59:09] Fugeki: if you don’t stream on NA anymore how am I watching if I live on NA
[3:59:10] CopperKat: A bigger group would at least make less grind for GPUs and more time for the actual fun stuff
[3:59:11] santilloo88: Love the one who stuck here, truly, BIg one up!!!!!
[3:59:14] realitijd24: see where the rp goes mhm
[3:59:22] ardit7ij: Finalize the leadership and then vote in who to invite as a membership @Nidas
[3:59:26] god7021: A lot of people in chat were like "AK BACK TO COP KEKW " is there a possibility of that happening?
[3:59:27] RU8H: i think the urgency to expand is largely on fomo. like having to rely on having loads of butc for every new thing.
[3:59:30] iKickMyself: the rp has been good def want to see where it goes
[3:59:42] Fishnet83: AINTNOWAY

[3:59:53] jauhrajapantai: Undercover AK mhm
[3:59:54] bahartin: From selling weed in Little Seuol to patroling 4heads dealers KEKW
[3:59:54] Kossti: AK was undercover this whole time
[3:59:56] coolwhipfire: Ak and 4head cops
[3:59:56] CopperKat: They want cops so bad too. Ones with experience
[3:59:57] bluddee: llo
[3:59:58] rivyaso: i think it will work out but in the long run if u dont have smart ppl in the group like AK maybe its gonna be so much messy and the group fail apart although its  a great RP from all
[4:00:00] etopplol: G unit returns
[4:00:01] LePtitGrec75: From an outside point of you it looks like the group is going to split. 1 side Ming/Fanny/Julian the other 4head/Future/Lovemore and maybe others.
[4:00:04] god7021: yeah lol
[4:00:05] jay_jaymann: fast track to 10 daps
[4:00:10] jauhrajapantai: Infernal Affairs style
[4:00:15] nosebeersx: @Nidas can people make dirty cops? i heard they have to get approved or something
[4:00:17] theastonshuffle: i fuck hard with the idea that things can't be rushed as the necessity for each person to alocate in their spaces and know each other well, just like you said to them that you got to know everyone on the group

[4:03:36] Izy7: expansion seems like natural move. These people already are working with group and some people are gone from original group. main problem is that people are kinda divided.

[4:04:10] CopperKat: Future, Jack, RJ and Kevin are chill, don’t know about the others
[4:04:14] coolwhipfire: @meltock I don’t think any npc could be that ugly
[4:04:18] zerborx: It's a gang remake from 3 years ago, new variables not gonna work
[4:04:19] nosebeersx: what if it works out and creates good RP though. You would never know if you guys dont try it i guess
[4:04:20] santilloo88: Nidas sssssssceptical

[4:04:46] coolwhipfire: what about 4heads weed sellers?
[4:04:46] lety_r1: who’s leading? Ming and Fanny?
[4:04:49] DevonVanHalem: julian is a weird character, got kicked out of so many gangs in 3.0
[4:04:50] Fishnet83: @Nidas Can you see potential in that size to build something where from you could facilitate RP from like you talked about before? Hmm
[4:04:52] onix146: Jamgie
[4:04:58] quadity2: Whether it works out or not, I think it would create good RP either way

[4:06:30] realitijd24: @demndia  lumber selling on their turf thats meta
[4:06:31] SilliTFT: well multiple people can use the same chip for joining a heist, so you could just have one that is always in a bench that you just take for heist then put it back in
