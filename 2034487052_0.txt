So we take esfands soft/slight chub size of 5.71 and multiply it by 1.42 to find his erect size. 5.71*1.42= 8.1

[6:14:04] Chrisaroo_: People cant separate Cornwood from Esfand
[6:14:04] typicaluser777: You know to be fair you have a lot of patience with this RP esfand, I've noticed a lot of streamers playing offline bc chat can't control themselves and hop from stream to stream. Yet for you, still continue through it

[6:15:06] MrDher: Move JP inside the police car?
[6:15:07] nuudelz: IRL theyre shooting

[6:15:08] GregaryLuks: sorry still NVL if a cop has to give up their gun at knife point then those dudes shouldn‚Äôt be able to pull some shit like that
[6:15:09] Edszyer: shoot them
[6:15:09] iEetNoobS: yeah, no one shoudl be afradi to take action
[6:15:10] keleviii: they should RP high-level situations in PD Academy , help with things like this sodaDink
[6:15:11] supaiiii: imagine what actual US police would do in that situation...
[6:15:13] Pravolution: They should have been shot, only reason they didn't is because all cops don't want to deal with x malding

[6:15:24] Kelborn: Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100  Idk about how they want it for RP, but IRL, if someone rammed a police vehicle where officers and suspect were in immediate danger of serious physical injury or death, the inside of that car would instantly be turned into mangled flesh and bone via firearms.

[6:15:32] forestm5: There‚Äôs a line between Cop RP and letting the people do whatever. That made cop RP look pointless. It was disrespect towards authority.
[6:15:32] madman2233: the captains are in their meeting room, bust and tell them they have to talk
[6:15:32] Thomefan251: because you watch xqc and decided to come here to chirp lol
[6:15:32] Mr_Cid: There is nothing good in PD most things broken or bad
[6:15:33] lightwarrior2088: locking down the scene better w/ barriers
[6:15:33] DViousGaming: The cuff mechanics needs to be reevaluated. Things like the taser or multiple cuffs should make it more difficult.
[6:15:34] sortr: lets just call it even and we all move forward
[6:15:34] Collectormat: better for SOMEONES RP.... yer
[6:15:36] ip33fr331y: I enjoy switching POV amongst you creators. it did take me a minute to understand cross chat messing up RP. I was so embarrassed when I realized. your content is really well produced, so I generally stick to your pov.

[6:16:10] JoJoRockets52: There should be a competition, if they break than the officer has a quicktime to try and recuff
[6:16:10] akaMattikins: but at the same time, tackle + cuff shouldn't = instant win either
[6:16:10] supaiiii: Percolatorx yes, easiest call ever

[6:54:04] KotH_Scooby_Doo_Futurama: fuck that you should voice ID how hard is it to put on a slight accent
[6:54:13] jdickson93: voice changer should be something crims use to hide their identity
[6:54:15] LorenYipsome: I always liked how SilentSentry used his voicechanger. It was pretty mild to deepen his voice when he was playing Curtis
[6:54:15] GorSTL: i get the feeling language in reports will be a source of DAP very soon lol esfandCOPS
[6:54:16] Qolat: So I'm told you can absolutely voice id.  It won't hold up in court, but you can make assumptions. @EsfandTV
[6:54:16] TheGhostlyOnyx: @erniejohnsonjr don't agree/haven't seen a lot of 3.0 = BabyRage  right?
[6:54:19] PlutoniumOC: lol
[6:54:20] Frozen_Tundras: Voice ID would introduce a lot of problems. Like for example one person playing multiple characters.
[6:54:20] Gachiguru: voice changers are a little power gamey

[6:54:32] travsmyth: @Chickenplucker26 pay money and get previous voice samples and i 100% garuntee you you cant tell the difference between your own parents and ai other then vocal inflections
[6:54:34] AndTimeBegins: boooo ads
[6:54:34] MackPlays: I couldnt do an accent to save my life
[6:54:34] PandaTelf: voice ID should be a thing when the cop knows the crim very intimiately
[6:54:36] eliteone11: @Gachiguru Gotta win the RP battle bro
[6:54:36] leavethe99: ya come on just put an accent
[6:54:37] TBirdJ1: i think voice id reduces the rp. crims just wont talk at that point

[6:54:38] SennAppel: can xqc sound different?
[6:54:39] daenerhis: @goingafk0 i think that's fair. im not stating my opinion btw. one of the other involved officers streams and i was watching his stream, and he said that was why he didnt just put him in the cruiser
[6:54:40] MonsterFuel: @EsfandTV if you can't voiceid why do crims use voice changer?
[6:54:40] Zarg0rth: nah vocie ID is stupid people putting on vocies isn't easy for everyone
[6:54:41] MacVane: like tell me you only want to win and stack money for the imaginary leaderboard without telling me
[6:54:41] jeffrey778: i think test to speech is very lazy for rp

[6:54:55] Bfakes: skill issue for sure i mean between the fail rp being tazed 5 times in a row, and laying spikes directly under tires somehow and them still getting away. idk kinda weird to me pd care that much.
[6:54:56] HereComesEveryone: If its just a voice ID you'll lose in court

[6:55:01] daenerhis: NODDERS mmmmmm
[6:55:01] imscaryofu: isn't the point of non-voiceID so people don't feel required to use voicechangers

[6:55:10] YodieWanKenobi: @YodieWanKenobi xD
[6:55:13] BadL__: @MacVane its just to equalize everyone since some people might be great at voices while others cant do any
[6:55:14] Qolat: @SennAppel He used a voice changer, but he still sounds like he's on meth.
[6:55:14] ZilzGaming: @KotH_Scooby_Doo_Futurama its for people who play multiple characters so they dont have to always do an accent
[6:55:17] Khaosshinobi: koil's opinion of voice id back in 2.0 is that you should not voice id someone because it's a city and there's "supposed to be so many" and you aren't seeing the same 10 people only as well
[6:55:17] Chickenplucker26: @travsmyth I have no idea what that is but I believe you. I didn't think it was too smooth yet but maybe that's the free stuff people use for YouTube that reads words incorrectly
[6:55:17] Zyphamon: I see it as a city of millions. Imo its better RP if people try to use accents though.

[6:55:27] el_reyito: hi cornwoodington
[6:55:27] RoloDage: voice-id doesn't seem quite in the spirit of RP, and just encourages voicechanger mods instead of fun
[6:55:30] knowlightnofear: Did you say police aren't allowed to be CORRUPT?
[6:55:33] CrystalDimension: @EsfandTV I think IDing by voice could be more of a Reasonable Suspicion to pursue someone but not an evidence in court @EsfandTV
[6:55:34] DukedURL: what does it mean when someone calls you a NVL god is malding holy
[6:55:35] jamiboiy: locals could sound like a certain RPer though, voice ID could easily be passed off
[6:55:35] Sweet_BabyJeebus: it's too hard to ignore, its better to RP off a bad accent
[6:55:36] TheGhostlyOnyx: @erniejohnsonjr ???? he said cops haven't been powerful no? cops at the end of 3.0 would just spam EMP gun every 3 seconds for anything is that nor powerful? Unless I misread something how am I wrong?
[6:55:38] surelyURjokingMrFeynman: @Bfakes if anything the fail RP is being tazed 5 times and still getting up and breaking cuffs 3 times
[6:55:40] smpies: if cops is efficent its not fun tbh ...theytry to get get out x out of police custody and fail its boring

[6:55:44] sortr: allowing voice changer but not allowing voice id seems incongruent
[6:55:44] MacVane: @BadL__ I get that i'm referring specifically to their use to avoid being ID'd even tho you can't ID them that way anyways
[6:55:48] detergent86: aziz‚Äôs voice changer voice is funny af
[6:55:52] travsmyth: @Chickenplucker26 yeah the free stuff is super scuffed but the deep fake stuff floating around the world irl is scary
[6:55:55] TorridK: if they dont want to be voice id'd maybe they shouldn't commit so many crimes 4Shrug
[6:55:56] MadderHatter: people are playing way too many different characters like angel/mary charles/his cop ect voice id wouldnt make any sense

[7:26:10] 1CaptainRedBeard1: @Blodghaarm The moment they were going berserk ramming the police cars in such a confined space you could make an argument for deadly force.
[7:26:11] Hustler__John: pepeW
[7:26:12] Murrig: @EsfandTV why not
[7:26:13] bossm60: @yeahhyeahh the streamers behind the crims said that they had no intent to harm, they were ramming cop cars to move them out of the way and avoiding the cops themselves essaying

[7:26:28] MerkinMenard: Stop Police Brutality they tasered some guy 6 times he could of had heart failure
[7:26:29] Gachiguru: @fireobserver he has no authority to tow vehicles. only police officers can call in tows at the moment
[7:26:29] Caeros: @fireobserver relax
[7:26:30] ExpedientMiner: I think what Captain turner is trying to articulate is cornwood exercised a perfect elvel of force for what the situation was. -dap surely
