[1:09:19] TitaniumTurtle9: It would be cool if they had a gas version of the raiden
[1:09:21] DrakeNightbane: Was watching someone drive the Raiden earlier and it looked so good.
[1:09:25] Miffmac: overpriced definitely
[1:09:25] kosaria29: Have you tried driving it off-road?
[1:09:28] ryokira_: it overheats so fast
[1:09:28] zuckscalulator: Ask someone who bought it
[1:09:33] luciddreamguy: Electric cars
[1:09:45] pixel_oop: It nice for city drive but bad for highway
[1:09:46] Soov: NP police and other people are using another website for img hosting, i showed garek last night and its working fine for him

[1:10:27] ryokira_: @Gastaftorz no it caps out at 95 speed
[1:10:28] mika04: as long as the car isn't red lining it doesn't overheat as much
[1:10:30] TheHigherSpace: It's bad to be managing your speed in a chase, another thing to worry about
[1:10:31] alpasoup1: Are there any upgrades for the electric cars that help with that
[1:10:36] Land_Of_Excuses: daily visit
[1:10:37] lumin_213: Huge restock Surely
[1:10:39] Omega16bit: it seemed pretty okay last night when cruising around with Hazel.
[1:10:41] slumvillager: hit cruise control in the upper 90's mph, you're golden
[1:10:41] Gonkish: Harry's truck is amazingly good, too, because of the acceleration
[1:10:44] Miffmac: it's just overpriced, if cars restock there would be better cars at same price
[1:10:45] dashbond: yo
[1:10:46] Soov: doesn't electric cars got insanely good off-road? just plan your escapes around that
[1:10:50] chilladdin: can turbos be placed in electric cars?
[1:10:51] ObsidiSean: Have you seen the car Yuno is going for now?
[1:10:54] Pironesis: What is the battery range? We saw yesterday that Harry's car doesn't have great range before it needs charging again.
[1:10:59] masontheartist: Eletrics drive really fun in RL too. The accel is always so satisfying
[1:11:03] mbaran12: kittys SUV?
[1:11:05] mbaran12: maybe
[1:11:07] Prebija: was there a restock ?
[1:11:07] mika04: 24%

[1:11:09] one30h: Buy it
[1:11:09] dayvidd: 24%
[1:11:09] mbaran12: it looks good
[1:11:09] SailorWS: 24?
[1:11:10] Palizangetsu: 24%
[1:11:13] alpasoup1: 24%
[1:11:13] billasensei: Will YUNO be a Millionaire by the time Moslies gets a ReStock? LUL LUL LUL
[1:11:13] Wo7lf1: 20% ?
[1:11:15] Skurai21: So I will say getting in a chase in that car is like giving out your ID to the cops
[1:11:16] FrostedGlas: does it have good cargo?
[1:11:16] Splashy_Pants: Warrener is my favorite, those fender mirrors
[1:11:17] ryokira_: its not bad by any means just overpriced
[1:11:17] NaturalSkeletor: POOR
[1:11:19] LoboYue: everybody wants a motorcycle
[1:11:20] bursky00: Is it still 24%?
[1:11:21] Wo7lf1: Damn
[1:11:29] Skurai21: Oh hey thats the Raiden must be Gege
[1:11:33] DrakeNightbane: Its 118k Basically.
[1:11:35] dashbond: lol
[1:11:38] Soov: you can check the tax in the newspaper stand, housing tax went down A LOT
[1:11:38] brook_192: worthhh
[1:11:39] yajjg: It's definitely over priced
[1:11:41] lumin_213: how mcuh grime pays if you are partner to person doing it

[1:12:00] Omega16bit: it zooms really cool. Hahahahahahaha.
[1:12:01] sibslol_: @lumin_213 about 7k an hour for each person I think??
[1:12:02] slumvillager: hope Gigi gets it, a silent ninja car would be perfect for her
[1:12:03] TheHigherSpace: jugular for the same price is so much better
[1:12:06] brook_192: its probably not gonna get cheaper especially if they buff it one day
[1:12:09] Pink_but: Why do prices in USA not account for tax btw?
[1:12:11] DrakeNightbane: Electric Cars are so much better than what they were week 1.
[1:12:13] numbertwodooky: limited stations
[1:12:23] Livesies: Paleto needs infrastructure
[1:12:30] lumin_213: @sibslol_ twinkl49Yuk2
[1:12:35] BlazingSaddleSores: @Pink_but because it looks cheaper and they dont legally have to peepoTeeth
[1:12:37] OutNinjad: could you petition the mayor to get charging stations up north?
[1:12:39] hungarian_potato: just put a generator in a trailer
[1:12:40] NickPenrhyn: If they add stations, that changes things
[1:12:42] Westius: @Pink_but i think its something to do with how the tax rates change from state to state?

[3:59:25] DarthRadonis: 110?
[3:59:35] apokalyptika: 120ush
[3:59:46] Kunotr0n: +Turbo cost

[4:00:31] Sykkuno: as long as you enver have to go north of vinewood its not bad
[4:00:32] Piperken: Do they try to keep the vehicles somewhat similar for gas etc like the one based off, so like the Hummer would use a lot of gas?
[4:00:38] OutNinjad: can you petition the mayor to get charging stations up north?

[4:01:33] ChibiDeviChaosCH: just dont let tony ride your car hehe
[4:01:36] OmgSofie: its very realistic, teslas dosent last a round of nurburgring before battery overheat tbh
[4:01:39] Tokaye: when they add the car customization later i feel like charge will be less of a problem
[4:01:45] Argantosnl: it's the top speed just overheat the battery, haven't really seen the charge go down that fast

[4:02:36] DataRew: The case you talked about with the quiet nature of the electric cars is VERY strong, imo
[4:02:37] numbertwodooky: the raiden would've probably been bought if it was 75k
[4:02:38] Argantosnl: Raiden is pretty good as long as you are not just speeding everywhere
[4:02:39] rhubarb_carl: I don't see much of a real downside
[4:02:43] just_alex: if it was closer to the price of the beejay then it would be a really solid option imo its just a lil too expensive
[4:02:45] Pironesis: At this point I think you just go for it.

[4:04:42] Splashy_Pants: braking seems pretty good too

[4:04:53] ChaosO1: oop
[4:04:53] rnAlsation: It seems like a controller, or any analogue throttle, would mitigate most of the battery heat problem.
[4:04:54] calvinhai: poor panto
[4:04:55] Voivid: is the white meter gas?
[4:04:57] OutNinjad: magnet car

[4:06:01] dragonsflame619: OOO\
[4:06:02] ColonelCustard: Paying $100k to go 86 is a bit eh though
[4:06:02] DataRew: I think as a cruiser, this is a supreme car, especially for cookin
[4:06:05] Elevator_Doors: that much speed with no drawbacks?
[4:06:08] Oshiball: okay now JUICE IT
[4:06:17] Tokaye: they cool a lot faster now too
[4:06:17] Zaanga: @hinatashoyou10 test drive time
[4:06:19] MorganGrimes: might be faster with a turbo too? but then you gotta worry about the turbo thieves
[4:06:19] seedsu: now imagine if you put a turbo in it too
[4:06:29] Argantosnl: is 100 still oke
[4:06:30] Daemon_Hood: It's a city car, that's why people don't like it that much. You cannot send it
[4:06:33] DestinysBlade: Question is can you in some way tune it for bigger battery or better heat?
[4:06:33] DrakeNightbane: 95 I believe is the max it can go without overheating.
[4:06:35] StillTrynaGetAHandbeezy: that's good city speed for maneuvering
[4:06:36] zGomazou: FishSTEER
[4:06:36] rhubarb_carl: Turbo in an EV lol
[4:06:38] l_Scant_l: can you get to sandy?

[4:06:45] Omega16bit: it gets up to 125 so quick.
[4:06:45] roagrr: only when you're travelling and yapping nodd
[4:06:46] blankrasp: Isn't the speed limit like 90 in a ton of places now too?
[4:06:46] drsethh: Electric cars don't get turbo fyi
[4:06:52] Jakxtra: what happens at max battery heat?
[4:06:57] nightneverlies: But is pretty slow when you got 4 people on the car
[4:06:59] Prebija: it's a good car

[5:10:24] TwhyLer14: @jamanious i think lang already said no?
[5:10:27] DuskxEnvoy: Probably felt betrayed and so they decided to get him back the "same way"
[5:10:59] ryokira_: shes in the corner of the room in the darknes whispering "why are you like this"
[5:11:11] interiorcastle: my guess is because hazel is an openhearted yapper, they probably saw him as a liability

[5:17:23] cyhunter23: @cyhunter23 MINORSPELLINGMISTAKE
[5:17:25] numbertwodooky: to be fair Luce was on his mind to talk to that day
[5:17:26] hinatashoyou10: Susge
[5:17:35] Stone_Frostbrew: Not gonna tell you where he knows from but I've seen it's not meta. Doesn't change how he's going about it though.
[5:17:37] ryokira_: yuno is very smart with his yapping guys, he is especially very secretive with names
[5:17:44] Tiilde: its fishing... and its SUPER sus
[5:17:48] kayneechan: How could Yuno do this.
[5:17:59] ludcrow: maybe Tony and Octo... they used to have a squad
[5:18:00] realitijd24: nodd
[5:18:00] monk6661: lack of subtlety
[5:18:01] DuskxEnvoy: Thats sus
[5:18:05] rosewin16: yuno's fault smh
[5:18:06] tacostarvedbeast: ahh so same reason Gigi wouldn’t join the company, loose lips

[5:18:29] DeeKoiii: that was a reason from fanny too but the game of information telephone happens in rp LUL
[5:18:29] PootieT: could he name drop because of his time with Yuno?
[5:18:34] jaczzi: Tony is the only accidental yapper we need
[5:18:35] called_me_sona: Yuno is smart the idea of ppl say he is Yapping to much is don't know what character Yuno is
[5:18:39] 4d20BluntDamage: His character might be better served on the civ side of things where secrets aren't as critical? shrujj
[5:18:46] sycafe: I think it was yesterday he asked yuno how he becomes friend with everyone
[5:18:57] interiorcastle: paranoid characters are great. they stretch out every storyline
[5:19:00] Deftscythe: you're over-thinking it imo. Hazel just wants you to know he knows, probably so you don't feel like you need to be cagey around him. like, what would hazel get out of you confirming it?
[5:19:09] ryokira_: @sycafe that wasnt hazel
[5:19:11] Xernique: Jesus
[5:19:15] hinatashoyou10: Chatting
[5:19:23] krashx33: wtf? thats meta ask KEKW
[5:19:25] loadingl_: One with nature marty
[5:19:31] numbertwodooky: @Deftscythe kind of a good point actually
[5:19:35] TwhyLer14: @called_me_sona yuno just throws out hints. then he also throws some wild off the wall thing to confuse them along the way 🤣
[5:19:43] goose_kaiju: that's kinda cool tho
[5:19:55] NickPenrhyn: @numbertwodooky It's not over-thinking, he hasn't demonstrated he can keep secrets
[5:20:05] NewtDungeons: gege is a character hope this helps ok
[5:20:06] AdLib_24: Gigi and Lang both LUL
[5:20:09] BRUTALlT0PS: @interiorcastle paranoid characters also make john paul
[5:20:10] Dean09_05: The whole crew overthink ngl KEKW
[5:20:11] interiorcastle: that's why she gets along with lang so much LUL

[5:20:30] ATadBit: Youre RPing wtf NOWAYING
[5:20:31] glumpyblacksheep: It's RP chat, it's not that deep
[5:20:31] jmartian01: Yeah yappers dont get the goods
[5:20:32] sycafe: @ryokira_ oh I might have remembered incorrectly my bad
[5:20:33] numbertwodooky: geegaNODDERS
[5:20:35] AleisterPheles: that's still not the way to go about that. he's the one being cagey
[5:20:37] realitijd24: nodd
[5:20:38] tacostarvedbeast: has gigi been betrayed in the past? or is it just her nature?
[5:20:39] ryokira_: its natural to feel paranoid over these things nodd
[5:20:39] xMASTRYx: A gossip
[5:20:41] reichenbachs: NOWAYING RP
[5:20:42] DuskxEnvoy: Would you say Tony is the silliest member of the crew? geegaThink
[5:20:43] goose_kaiju: hhHMMM
[5:20:46] Prebija: yea i think the same
[5:20:48] jmartian01: 300 gold star yapper
[5:20:49] called_me_sona: Lang and Gigi has the same trait.... but the difference is Lang is just blunt.. while gigi observe and play with her word
[5:20:53] BRUTALlT0PS: gigi is a beast of a character
[5:20:54] loadingl_: Mmmmm
[5:21:03] exnatcloud: just tuned back in. we talking about yuno?
[5:21:04] ryokira_: @sycafe u were prob thinking of dexx
[5:21:05] xiell: cleanjj
[5:21:07] solonoobish: I mean it is a fair evaluation
[5:21:11] BlazingSaddleSores: cleanjj
[5:21:13] Tiilde: @Deftscythe the entire crew is suppose to be low key and not connected to each other in eye of public. Thats the reason why people have civ jobs
[5:21:14] BlazingSaddleSores: !meta
[5:21:14] Nightbot: Meta is not allowed in Twitch chat.  Meta-gaming is providing information to Gigi that she has not learned WHILE IN-GAME.  If you continuously try to provide external information, you will be timed out or banned.  The only place where mods allow meta discussion is in discord.gg/geega #gta-nopixel
[5:21:14] Daemon_Hood: cleanjj
[5:21:17] MasterGoblinn: Wouldn't that very mind set make it hard to get along with Yuno?
[5:21:22] gnarus: cleanjj
[5:21:24] sycafe: @ryokira_ oh thats right! he was in the phone thanks
[5:21:32] solonoobish: wait that's so worth it
[5:21:32] Stone_Frostbrew: If it was someone in your crew sharing info thats one thing but an outsider doing it makes them kinda sus
[5:21:33] SavageNewb: cleanjj
[5:21:37] TwhyLer14: @mastergoblinn yuno is methodical with it
[5:21:45] Daemon_Hood: @MasterGoblinn Yuno is closed lip with crew's internal stuff
[5:21:47] DuskxEnvoy: Oh damnit again cleanjj
[5:21:48] interiorcastle: @MasterGoblinn like i said before though- if you listen to yuno talk, he stops right before the edge. he only leaks what he does to make it less awkward ooc
[5:21:48] NickPenrhyn: Yuno 100% has discretion
[5:21:51] realitijd24: yuno knows the politics
[5:21:51] jmartian01: yuno is cagey at least
[5:21:53] PToastman: geegaPaper
[5:21:57] Shuzan: yea yuno is not stupid, he knows when to shut up
[5:21:57] kayneechan: Yuno snitches to every other crew except his own crew.
[5:22:01] Odden7: Yuno doesn't say names, just says a friend and only certain info
[5:22:02] ryokira_: yuno is very careful with what he shares nodd
[5:22:02] numbertwodooky: plus Yuno fishes as much as he gives ok
[5:22:05] Xernique: Yuno is smart with what he tells people
[5:22:06] DrKarate_: Yuno also says so much bullshit it's hard to know what's true
[5:22:06] fortresscw: also he’s very specific on what he says nothing to important
[5:22:07] Dean09_05: Yuno plays games or tell stuff when they are out out
[5:22:08] luckerooni: yuno is like a demon lord with selectively "overtelling" he makes people think he says everything
[5:22:09] Thepoperope: yuno always rides the line.. saying without saying
[5:22:10] lumin_213: he do 20% truth 80% false for chaos
[5:22:10] hypnomaze: yuno trades info as well
[5:22:12] Livesies: Yuno is an information broker
[5:22:13] rosewin16: yuno's also solidly in the crew and lang and the others trust him
[5:22:14] DannysDomain: FYI the joke that Yuno yaps too much has been proven false so many times LUL
[5:22:17] xLegendori: i am a fan of this outfit
[5:22:18] loonlunar: yuno's definitely careful about what he says
[5:22:18] blade0013: Yep, yuno is smart
[5:22:19] called_me_sona: Yuno know what he is saying to whom he is saying it thats the difference
[5:22:20] allen_sky: Yuno only hints, never just says it plainly
[5:22:21] interiorcastle: yep like after being bombarded by jean paul and CG, he still didn't leak anything about the dongles
[5:22:22] hypnomaze: so he doesnt jus tell without getting anything back
[5:22:25] Tiilde: Yuno collects info. he fishes OTHERS for info... for the benefit of the crew
[5:22:26] blueperreelsshow: yuno the edging yapper
[5:22:27] halfstepmadness: The usb incident prove it
[5:22:27] BRUTALlT0PS: yuno will say thing to prevent OOC meta but nothing that will hurt his friends
[5:22:27] NoVeMoRe: Yuno in 4.0 is crazy at gaining intel at little to no cost
[5:22:31] Prebija: Yuno snitches the info only for a reason to get more info out of it.
[5:22:34] luminousdovee: shadow leader things
[5:22:34] blarg200: yeah its like a double edged sword he gets info but he gives info
[5:22:35] jmartian01: @Livesies great way to put it
[5:22:35] christina_remy: Yuno took the brunt of CG phone calls for not saying about  handing in the dongles
[5:22:38] DannysDomain: Sykkuno "If you think Yuno Yaps too much, then you arent paying attention"
[5:22:39] Aynumi: who can’t keep a secret?
[5:22:41] funnelcakeeee: some people still thinks yuno runs solo and works with multiple crews... i think he has his ways
[5:22:41] kayneechan: Yuno shares what he learned from other crews to every crew except his own crew.
[5:22:42] POETICWORLD: He likes to troll, but he's careful with what he trolls
[5:22:43] tacostarvedbeast: also yuno and tony already in the group, big difference when talking about gigi vouching for someone
[5:22:55] glumpyblacksheep: Yuno talks a LOT, he says very little
[5:22:57] holybaldspot: @kayneechan YOU INSANE BRO
[5:22:58] XavelX: I feel like Yuno is an info broker he let people know some unlocks to get some unlocks later
[5:23:01] POETICWORLD: That's my streamer
[5:23:01] imtwopie: Yuno's Yuno. Simple ass :shrujj:
[5:23:03] jaestorme13: Yuno did leak what he shouldn't at the beginning of his time in 3.0 before he knew better, and adjusted, but chatters and some streamers never let it go.
[5:23:04] twoflykevv: remember when he told x about sparkle and x thought he was fucking with him
[5:23:11] simply_11soft: Yuno only informed people of the most useless information
[5:23:16] interiorcastle: and got convinced to drive into the ocean. very trustworthy LUL
[5:23:19] F7Rhyx: yuno trades common info for rare info
[5:23:23] rjayzz: It's ironic JP hates Yuno because he yaps too much but gets upset at him when he's not being truthful to him
[5:23:26] Dean09_05: Not really KEKW
[5:23:29] funnelcakeeee: om
[5:23:31] ballpointpenn: literally not true lmao
[5:23:32] blueperreelsshow: 😂
[5:23:35] ryokira_: me when i make shit up

[5:23:48] Hades_bz: did gigi had the talk with lang?
[5:23:48] ludcrow: hes an agent of chaos
[5:23:53] Reazonyx: He is building connections for info network
[5:23:53] Crimson_95: People forget 3.0 and 4.0 Yuno are very different too.
[5:23:54] ATadBit: Chatter is RPing a fantasy OMEGALUL
[5:23:54] gavin292002: he very selective on what he leaks
[5:23:55] Last_Paragon: Yuno tells Lang everything
[5:23:55] ballpointpenn: he helps all his friends when he can, but when it would hurt his crew he knows not to share
[5:23:56] christina_remy: @twoflykevv was funny as he said x would never believe it anyway lol
