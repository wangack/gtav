[8:13:59] SirSaltyBacon: jesus its 3:30am
[8:14:01] SnitchBubbles: bloom having the powah makes me happy Gladge
[8:14:11] pastyface: I heard you say you cant move during detainment. Harold had an odd situation with a lawyer on scene interfering and had to move
[8:14:36] SirSaltyBacon: there's a few exceptions, that is one of them
[8:14:42] Swiftym8: clean hit
[8:14:49] MisterTohru: and even for safety its only move them a reasonable amount
[8:14:52] Hento: yea they just need to write out the execptions instead of it just being word of mouth when
[8:14:57] middy_92: Or they request a lawyer
[8:15:00] SnitchBubbles: @pastyface once you move them, weather you know it or not, they are under arrest and if you cant articulate pc then its monkaS
[8:15:20] SnitchBubbles: unless its for their safety like moose said Gladge
[8:15:39] pastyface: im sure the situtions were very different but im wondering where the grey area is
[8:15:45] SirSaltyBacon: Yeah it's basically an unreasonable restriction of their freedom. Moving someone from the sidewalk to the car for safety in traffic is an exception, etc.
[8:16:02] SirSaltyBacon: A gun fight breaks out in the area, you can move into a cruiser etc.
[8:16:09] SnitchBubbles: ^
[8:16:17] MisterTohru: you need pretty extenuating circumstances to move a detained person to a pd solely for safety
[8:16:19] SirSaltyBacon: But like full transfer to a PD is not a detainment.
[8:16:44] Swiftym8: Madge time to really show him how much you hate him
[8:16:49] watchesyou_sleep: come here for some punishment cole
[8:17:00] Swiftym8: dont listen to her og
[8:17:01] Hento: all this good Police knowledge, gated behind Grapeseed PD lol
[8:17:03] Swiftym8: you need twitch primes
[8:17:04] SirSaltyBacon: Maybe the only exception to that is if someone is actively being hunted and you need to question them.
[8:17:04] zachop89: it is if they request a lawyer
[8:17:08] pastyface: I dont even want to go further cause im sure ill fuck up the reasoning, im betting myles knew what he was doing
[8:17:13] SirSaltyBacon: But yeah, it is interesting
[8:17:35] watchesyou_sleep: @SirSaltyBacon when are you going to violate rights for the memes?
[8:17:50] SirSaltyBacon: lmao i used excessive force once on gordo
[8:17:54] SirSaltyBacon: but he 100% deserved that shit
[8:17:56] SirSaltyBacon: and i'd do it again
[8:18:01] Hento: @SirSaltyBacon Clap
[8:18:04] LexTheQueer: sheeeeeesh
[8:18:05] Roobeman: Hedi Gladge
[8:18:11] watchesyou_sleep: gordo isnt a real person. hes a punching bag brought to life

[8:18:31] mejftw: GNASH-errr?
[8:18:31] Swiftym8: he kinda looks like a puppet
[8:18:35] zachop89: Ramona yay
[8:18:37] mejftw: sounds like a dota2 hero
[8:18:40] Hento: G-Nash, that sounds hard as fuck
[8:18:41] Seetherrr: @SirSaltyBacon i wish he streamed
[8:18:42] MisterTohru: gnicole gnash
[8:19:06] mercifullrs: Giga Nash
[8:19:08] SirSaltyBacon: But yeah, Franklin will never intentionally violate rights. I really don't like fucking someone over intentionally in a video game where you can basically hold someone hostage
[8:19:50] mejftw: leeds cornering anyone- trying to visualize that lol
[8:19:59] Hento: this man self starting!
[8:20:02] mercifullrs: OBJECTION
[8:20:02] SnitchBubbles: Ayub UltraMad
[8:20:09] SirSaltyBacon: like a fucking lawn mower
[8:20:13] SirSaltyBacon: just yanking the ripcord
[8:20:22] MisterTohru: being corrupt shold lead to like, long arcs, not to just fuck people over for 5 month sentences
[8:20:23] mejftw: wait not skylar sparks
[8:20:27] irtherod1: Noooo
[8:20:28] pastyface: @SirSaltyBacon im praying for that immaculate conception

[8:20:33] Seetherrr: PEPW
[8:20:38] irtherod1: You did this
[8:20:39] Swiftym8: so its your fault
[8:20:43] Hento: what did she do, I dont even remember her saying anything during that case
[8:20:51] Rem753: @Hento probably argued the ruling after the fact
[8:21:12] Swiftym8: DESKCHAN
[8:21:13] SnitchBubbles: PEPW
[8:21:13] Kamtae: i did see she stormed out when the judge said come back after the case @Hento
[8:21:44] Hento: hmm, I caught the greco side when he pulled the trigger, but nothing on her end
[8:21:54] SnitchBubbles: wait which ADA is this about Susge
[8:22:09] punishedmatt: they want pc to push the charge??????
[8:22:19] mejftw: some other one i forgot already some my little pony name hmm
[8:22:33] SnitchBubbles: Hmmge
[8:22:54] Swiftym8: is this a statement about how he didnt read the statements
[8:22:56] mejftw: "'breakfast was the driver"" ?
[8:22:57] Hento: that 51/49 reasonable doubt
[8:22:57] thion7: bro i hate to do this
[8:22:58] thion7: but
[8:23:01] thion7: ???????????????

[8:25:15] Hento: to talk? i ment to type lol
[8:25:27] SnitchBubbles: no hento you were right the first time Gladge
[8:25:32] mejftw: @Hento i think his voice is too nazaly for it to work properly so better without it
[8:25:35] SnitchBubbles: penta cant talk either Gladge
[8:25:59] Kraddu: He didn't take notes, just did stick figures and that weird s we all drew in middle school
[8:26:01] Swiftym8: EATO thanks your honour
[8:26:17] pastyface: lambda is the saviour of late shift 3 DOJ
