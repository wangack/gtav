[5:37:38] docholidayfl: what do your hoa dues go to?
[5:38:02] Lauren__Beth: @koasok it‚Äôs just part of living in a HOA. they want things to look a certain way to keep house values up but the deals you get on other stuff usually makes up for it. also helps if Karens aren‚Äôt in charge of it.
[5:38:09] cannucky: get a recording of them admitting they went in your mailbox and file a criminal complaint with the regional postmaster

[5:40:35] Lauren__Beth: my MIL‚Äôs HOA was good. no one really cared. we only got a complaint about 4 months after she passed. we hadn‚Äôt taken care of the lawn/yard in that time.
[5:40:50] SmokeSomethin: bro thats litereally me, i bought a challenger in 2022 and i still only have 4k miles on it KEKW

[5:41:27] cannucky: I would go online . find the code then search the cross reference to different paint brands
[5:41:33] Lauren__Beth: @koasok it‚Äôs the Karens more than anything. most neighbors don‚Äôt tend to go overboard unless it‚Äôs wicked bad.
[5:41:55] cannucky: 35 years in the building industry bud

[5:42:33] VLeviathanV: I painted trim for 5 years you wouldn't believe how many shades of white there are
[5:42:51] notsoslimshady36: Did u sign up to the hoa when u  moved in?

[5:43:42] koasok: @Lauren__Beth  trust i know i had to go redo a fence one time because there kids put something on the fence after i stained it and they were supposed to let it sit for a bit
[5:43:44] zrussell93: So... when the sun bleaches that color to something that isn't that color do you have to get your house re-painted or get a lien on your house?
[5:43:48] 2ksdelta: bunch of kids no?
[5:43:50] JLangg: it took my dad almost a year to get approved to paint the house. HOA is not worth it, i will never do it
