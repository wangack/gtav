[0:39:09] Lum_O: you start cutting your fingers with every interaction with person KEKW
[0:39:20] JackLDN27: South Park ep about this, Stan see's everything as crap "You're getting old"
[0:39:36] buffedel5: if you dont want to interact with other people in person, you become a twitch chatter

[0:41:26] buffedel5: Unironically, one of the easiest way to make friends as an adult man is sports
[0:41:49] gostonko: work friends are a good macrocosm of these dynamics
[0:41:50] Paupor: peepoGlad
[0:41:53] ViolenceOfDucks: isn't it a little weird to treat interactions as a transaction?
[0:42:11] gostonko: Smokge quoth the raven
[0:42:18] supernovagrl: it happens a lot with autism as well
[0:42:45] Supastar01: 100% a transaction of time
[0:43:01] Supastar01: you only realise this as you get older i feel
[0:43:04] FideICastro_: what too much capitalism does to a mf

[0:44:53] Ragnogh: we don’t think about it terms on a monetary transaction but we are constantly evaluating if something or someone is worth our time.
[0:44:59] buffedel5: Maybe that's just the extrovert in me speaking though
[0:45:17] gurglet: @buffedel5 not with all of them. Some people you just find boring
[0:45:34] gostonko: i used to feel sorry for the old people who would corner me at work and start yapping

[0:47:24] buffedel5: I think that's my point... you sorta control whether an interaction is boring or not by your own mindset
[0:47:30] Formats: people these days love putting themselves into boxes
[0:47:52] gurglet: everyone has their own definition of what is introvert/extrovert
[0:48:16] gostonko: i'm told people can really tell when i'm not interested and it comes off as rude
[0:48:21] zuckscalulator: @nidas have you seen 4head and the vagos hiring dogs and chicken as dealers?
[0:48:24] gostonko: i try not to but its just a part of autism
[0:48:37] snacksonly: lol same
[0:48:40] buffedel5: Someone could be talking about something uninteresting but it can be interesting for a few minutes with good questions.
[0:48:53] Ragnogh: there is also a difference between making quick judgments and deciding before hand you don’t like all people.
[0:48:55] buffedel5: but it does reach a point...
[0:48:56] zuckscalulator: I'm autistic but it's funny
[0:49:09] supernovagrl: @gostonko same lol
[0:49:10] OkayyJake: I think being introverted often comes down to lack of confidence or self-esteem in a lot of people

[0:50:16] gurglet: @OkayyJake I would say that is more that you are "shy" more than "introverted"

[2:24:29] IKEA_DOG: plugged the cables wrong mate

[2:24:34] EnigmaQuip: that display, are only 3 racks linked?
[2:24:37] Lum_O: MinerEXT it seems showing value 1 BUTC an Hour not 6
[2:24:45] TheDestinyWeShare: artesian build mining rack?
[2:24:50] muskin6: Racks should be at 0.25 and wallet for 0.41
[2:24:51] 7thLettter: yeah nah yeah nah FTC, fix the coin
[2:24:57] EnigmaQuip: like the top row separate from the second row
[2:25:05] muskin6: Racks should be at 0.25 and wallet for 0.041
[2:25:24] AdanTheEpiphany: one zero too much
[2:25:37] epic_smee: the decimal is wrong on your racks
[2:25:43] muskin6: Racks are not mining to the capacity
[2:25:44] gurglet: the rack is 1/10 of what it should be
[2:25:51] IKEA_DOG: oh yeah just the decimal wrong
[2:25:57] mariuspure: ah I see
[2:26:00] jojaha: true
[2:26:06] gurglet: that is 0.6 btc per 24 hours
[2:26:07] mariuspure: yea
[2:26:07] jojaha: yep
[2:26:10] kodakuma_: huh why ?
[2:26:15] epic_smee: thats so much lol
[2:26:30] manfredalfredgernot: And you even replaced and refilled the racks
[2:26:31] mariuspure: yeah def a bug
[2:26:33] epic_smee: i wonder if it is the case for all groups.
[2:26:38] IKEA_DOG: I've never seen this on anyone elses racks
[2:26:42] mariuspure: epic_smee must bne
[2:26:44] Mcgeezax90: try just one rack?
[2:26:45] Waron_: is it mining with the value of the lowest rack?
[2:26:50] Lizaard_King: the math isn’t mathing
[2:26:55] iiidaaah: never seen this with any other crew
[2:26:57] Xpatrol: i thin best solution is remove gpu then rack and place them again
[2:26:57] EnigmaQuip: this house really is cursed
[2:26:58] meego0o: x10 NotLikeThis
[2:27:12] Suvaacc: yeah it was bugged 1 day when you lost some, then they re-placed the racks and i think it started working, but its fucked after adding 4th racks again
[2:27:13] myvii_: can you spread out the GPU's so each rack has the same amount, maybe it's a bug with different num of GPU's in a rack?
[2:27:17] muskin6: And i think it's only bugged for u guys
[2:27:25] AdanTheEpiphany: @myvii_ ^^
[2:27:46] IKEA_DOG: Did u maybe put them in the wrong "room" somehow?
[2:27:55] IKEA_DOG: if that would even do anything
[2:28:09] kodakuma_: also if the racks or pc's clip the wall sometimes it glitches out
[2:28:17] senlash: y
[2:28:26] JariDrude: @Waron_ the lowest rack is 0.2 per day but with the current speed its mining 0.6 per day
[2:28:31] jack25351: maybe its a nerf
[2:28:56] mariuspure: classic koil nerf maaaaan
[2:28:58] gostonko: KEKW
[2:29:00] jack25351: lmao
[2:29:00] epic_smee: either way, a decimal error makes no sense if "placed" racks are an issue.
[2:29:02] iamloff: lmfao
[2:29:03] ViolenceOfDucks: 4head aoe debuff
[2:29:10] Absolutzer0_v2: This house is like a Rust base KEKW
[2:29:24] gostonko: yeah i would have thought a decimal error would just be an incorrect multiplier in the code epic_smee
[2:29:47] gostonko: if its a variable in game that would be weird
[2:29:52] IKEA_DOG: yeah there's no way it's a placement error
[2:29:56] mariuspure: its either a bug or you need 10x electricity KEKW
[2:29:59] senlash: eons of butcoin NOOO
[2:30:02] epic_smee: @gostonko exactly
[2:30:06] MellowMelon: houses probably bugged atm, think there's a problem with drying racks too
[2:30:09] CuppaT_XYZ: yokerDespair MathTime
[2:30:09] kodakuma_: @IKEA_DOG could be clipping bugs out pc and racks
[2:30:11] myvii_: there's one rack with 1/10 GPU in it, maybe it's applying to all racks?
[2:30:12] gostonko: call GeekSquad
[2:30:14] thajollypirate: Anticimex Ingevar
[2:30:30] IKEA_DOG: @IKEA_DOG yeah but why would that make it move a decimal
[2:30:35] epic_smee: lol
[2:30:35] Absolutzer0_v2: burnt out the GPUs?
[2:30:48] NebelKop: have you tried turning it off and on again mhm
[2:30:48] Absolutzer0_v2: are they consumable?
[2:30:51] Lum_O: problem with power?
[2:31:03] MellowMelon: not enough cooling Pog
[2:31:19] iZeeMo: maybe too much power used ?
[2:31:22] CuppaT_XYZ: nidasWaiting
[2:31:23] nek2k: Power over 200 may be the problem
[2:31:27] gostonko: 00:06 gostonko: lookUp what the servers doing where heat rises to
[2:31:33] Absolutzer0_v2: I mean what will they say "its not a bug"
[2:31:38] kodakuma_: @nek2k nah its not probably
[2:31:42] AdanTheEpiphany: it not giving info so don't u have to assume its a bug?
[2:31:43] Kossti: worth asking
[2:31:43] Suvaacc: maybe there is actual overheating feature
[2:31:46] Xpatrol: just remove all rack on put only 3 full and try again ?
[2:31:50] epic_smee: you can try some stuff this tsunami and if it doesnt work, report it i guess
[2:31:51] AloofMango: peepoHey
[2:31:53] ky05uk3: weed strain name still bugged as well?
[2:31:56] mawrgg: is it they are too far away and not being cooled? so they overheated?
[2:31:58] MellowMelon: I mean, try getting cooling equal to heating
[2:32:03] mariuspure: I'd try to put 1 rack and 1 gpu and see if the color changes
[2:32:03] Fishnet83: @ky05uk3 nope. it's sorted NODDERS
[2:32:04] DustyzAli: yeah company are around 900
[2:32:06] Dentvis: @kodakuma_ nice disclaimer
[2:32:06] epic_smee: cooling issue is realistic. GPUs overheating
[2:32:06] IKEA_DOG: how long has this been going on?
[2:32:08] meego0o: the racks have own ventilation too
[2:32:13] gurglet: the interface is bugged either way, it shouldn't say that it is mining 6 btc / day when it is mining 0.6
[2:32:14] NebelKop: KEKW
[2:32:15] DXCraze: KEKW
[2:32:16] JariDrude: if it was not a bug, the app should display a lower butc/day
[2:32:19] coolwhipice: This is indeed a curses house
[2:32:24] coolwhipice: Cursed*
[2:32:24] 1Bust: where are the irl crypto miners to tell you what you're doing wrong?
[2:32:26] mariuspure: true JariDrude
[2:32:26] mawrgg: Surely try its own room with vents and cooling?
[2:32:26] Mcgeezax90: cursed house, you need a priest
[2:32:32] mariuspure: yeah def bug
[2:32:34] KhangVuPanda: I just joined whats the issue?
[2:32:36] ky05uk3: @ky05uk3 Oh nice so they finally got NDK? :D
[2:32:54] IKEA_DOG: Yeah I mean there's a bug either way. Either ur mining the incorrect amount or the incorrect butt/hour is displayed
[2:32:57] IKEA_DOG: bug either way no?
[2:32:57] mawrgg: no harm in posting a bug report.
[2:33:03] meego0o: im sure its 4head
[2:33:03] kodakuma_: i was just trying to say its not power sorry :p
[2:33:11] fraudiola9: Scuffed house
[2:33:14] Dentvis: bugstars MadgeLate
[2:33:17] senlash: Chatting just letting you know that i think the btc gpu is wrong
[2:33:32] zvidrvhim: Yall already missing out on about alteast 9 btc tbf
[2:33:34] epic_smee: @IKEA_DOG not neccessairly. if the gpus are damaged and the devs made it so that you only mine 1/10 if no GPUs are working, it makes sense.
[2:33:36] gostonko: we need a pocket dev again Sadge
[2:33:41] Meltock: tobii secretly getting revenge for always being called a danish troll Susge

[2:34:34] iZeeMo: Cul-de-sac curse
[2:34:37] ghutta: @epic_smee if that's the case, they should also somehow show that. as in irl you can get your hash rate or whatever it's called for your gpus
[2:34:38] mariuspure: you guys would be nr1 group by now
[2:34:39] CuppaT_XYZ: buddha griefing you to bring leslie back frfr
[2:34:39] kodakuma_: @steveroo1 were they not checking ? LUL
[2:34:41] zvidrvhim: Atleast 9
[2:34:43] meego0o: times 10
[2:34:56] IKEA_DOG: @epic_smee yeah but then they're displaying the wrong amount, either they forgot to implement the correct b/h display when it's "fried" or it's bugged then
[2:34:56] LePtitGrec75: I think it says on the desktop 0.025 no ?
[2:35:12] kodakuma_: are you sure someone is not taking the btc out ?
[2:35:16] Mantelrorelsen: And another house
[2:35:22] epic_smee: @IKEA_DOG well it's red. maybe thats the indicator. but who knows. might as well be bugged
[2:35:22] steveroo1: yeah the progression is slowed so much bc of the racks
[2:35:22] IKEA_DOG: PTSD from that alarm sound
[2:35:25] AdanTheEpiphany: @kodakuma_ its not mining enough per hours
[2:35:42] CuppaT_XYZ: @IKEA_DOG i instantly reached for my phone yokerSuffer
[2:35:43] gostonko: kodakuma_ he tested how much it mined for the past hour
[2:35:59] LePtitGrec75: I think you should report as a bug for the past 3 days
[2:36:00] IKEA_DOG: @CuppaT_XYZ same cuz my alarm rang 5 mins ago OMEGALUL
[2:36:07] Mantelrorelsen: A huge setback
[2:36:16] jojaha: how much butcoind would be 0.2/1 day, maybe it farms somehow from the lowest amount?
[2:36:20] mawrgg: someone hasnt clicked on the "pay for a dealer" have they and so all the BTC is going?
[2:36:27] ky05uk3: honestly if it's bugged this is a massive setback

[2:43:23] iZeeMo: REfund is cool and all but the best thing would be for it to work I believe
[2:43:41] epic_smee: oh okay
[2:43:41] iiidaaah: so instead of getting 6 per 24 you're getting 0.6???
[2:43:57] epic_smee: yes makes no sense either
[2:43:59] epic_smee: way
[2:44:07] warkid123: Can you unlink and relink those Racks?
[2:44:21] etopplol: wait so you arent even getting a 1 per 24 hours ?
[2:44:25] epic_smee: the decimal error is the most logical thing. and that is probably a coding issue. but if that would be the case, other groups would have the same isse.
[2:44:25] wadebyjamesjuh: 0.6 plus 1 from the pc
[2:44:27] epic_smee: issue
[2:44:37] LePtitGrec75: it looks like even the computer doesn’t even mine at 1butcoin/h
[2:44:39] AdanTheEpiphany: maybe hdd fucked
[2:44:48] AdanTheEpiphany: can u get miner ext on other one?
[2:44:49] Xpatrol: moving the rack around maybe fucked up
[2:44:59] kodakuma_: yeah thats true
[2:45:00] LePtitGrec75: 1butc/day sorry
[2:45:02] gurglet: no, the computer was correct
[2:45:02] IKEA_DOG: SHouldn't be an HDD issue since the pc itself is mining the correct amount?
[2:45:07] AdanTheEpiphany: @LePtitGrec75 a day
[2:45:13] Suvaacc: isnt that the stolen HDD in that, maybe thats why its fucked
[2:45:18] Xpatrol: pc was correct

[2:46:27] kodakuma_: wait (6+1)/7
[2:46:30] LePtitGrec75: yes but the pc it self should mine 1butcoin per day and it doesn’t
[2:46:33] kodakuma_: u get 0.29
[2:46:42] Dentvis: I don't get it dankCrayon
[2:46:51] Xpatrol: @kodakuma_ no its individual
[2:46:56] warkid123: It makes sense :D

[2:47:06] sadge_24_7_: THEY BE dankCrayon
[2:47:07] CuppaT_XYZ: mhm maybe so much butcoin has been mined in the economy that its getting harder to mine but the UI isn't updating to reflect this
[2:47:07] Martey: It makes sense, people are just dumb af
[2:47:08] iiidaaah: It makes super good sense
[2:47:08] kodakuma_: when u collect it collect from both no ?
[2:47:08] ItAintEasyBeingWheezy: Sorry... I went to public school LUL

[2:48:25] ItAintEasyBeingWheezy: Soooo.... 1+1 is not 3?
[2:48:26] KhangVuPanda: can you actually mathmatically prove that 1x1=1?
[2:48:26] Xpatrol: @swankytiger942221 i mean some people think earth is flat
[2:48:27] IKEA_DOG: well koda is right but he's missing the point
[2:48:34] LePtitGrec75: if in 1h it doesn’t add up maybe add cooling around to drop the temp
[2:48:35] Martey: @IKEA_DOG LUL

[2:48:38] Supastar01: what is a mining pc
[2:48:38] epic_smee: @kodakuma_ well it should, you are correct. but the racks collect 1/10
[2:48:38] Fyeah: @Xpatrol earth isnt flat?

[2:48:40] Supastar01: kekw

[2:49:07] timbres: Damn he’s kind of spittin
[2:49:08] iZeeMo: Like you said earlier I think this is a server proibem or scuff idk but you can't really do anything about it
[2:49:13] warkid123: It is 1 every 24 hours without the racks (and you have to "wallet" that one). The other 6 from the miner are automatically getting walled, thus you can differentiate bboth numbers

[2:50:22] ky05uk3: The Sani War grinds on D:

[2:52:00] swankytiger942221: @nidas there is stuff other than heat like the cooling and stuff like that
[2:52:01] SWoRD_Jr: were you able to confirm if its just your setup or everyone else as well?
[2:52:06] EnigmaQuip: or maybe chat should just stop back seating
[2:52:08] Farmaros: it should say its mining 0.6 if its throttled
[2:52:09] timbres: Maybe you bought a fucked up house
[2:52:11] 911_raj: Lol hahahhah
[2:52:12] sharky_00_: TRUUUUUU

[2:52:23] Farmaros: unless its bugged
[2:52:26] Dentvis: @EnigmaQuip Chatting no, I know better
[2:52:27] tortilluh: And he has HVAC venting too
[2:52:30] PantherVlll: SCHIZO they neighbors are siphoning our crypto
[2:52:33] Celascion: is the fix rn just reconnect and connect the racks to the computer every time you wake up?
[2:52:33] iZeeMo: If it would be the heat you probably would've known in RP since it is an issue taht is occuring for a few days already
[2:52:37] mariuspure: shouldnt have bought a house at ESB turf 💀
[2:52:43] muskin6: Your racks are too close to each other maybe thats the issuee
[2:52:50] LePtitGrec75: its clearly 3 days step back unfortunately
[2:52:51] senlash: 💀💀
[2:52:53] 1Bust: what if the bug is the feature
[2:52:55] Dentvis: maaaaan
[2:52:57] Celascion: omg it's the grove curse D:
[2:52:57] fraudiola9: is it like the room folder thing where you have to put racks file in the room folder @nidas
[2:52:58] swankytiger942221: @nidas I agree with I think it's a bug. I'm just saying are you sure it's not something with heating and cooling. That's it
[2:52:58] Paralyzor: thats what happens when you get a house with 4head. not only does he grief you. everything he touches will too
[2:53:00] Dentvis: get out of the house this will never end
[2:53:00] Subo_ignorethispart: maybe its a feature but the display is a big PepeLaugh
[2:53:08] gostonko: i cant believe nobody has gifted yet
[2:53:09] Dentvis: fuck I backseated
[2:53:11] Dentvis: MODS
[2:53:11] zvidrvhim: What if the item despawns cuz its in a room and stops mining cuz no one is in the area? @nidas
[2:53:13] gostonko: my tree farm FeelsWeakMan
[2:53:25] zvidrvhim: Same goes with the weed
[2:53:28] ObamaBinDroning: FeelsBadMan
[2:53:35] AdanTheEpiphany: it was mining
[2:53:36] fraudiola9: is it like the room folder thing where you have to put racks file in the room folder @nidas
[2:53:37] iZeeMo: How are you today tho @Nidas?
[2:53:38] AdanTheEpiphany: so nope
[2:53:43] tortilluh: But the entire house despawned when people leave
[2:53:48] Nategamer97: people are in the area alot tho
[2:53:49] tortilluh: Despawns
[2:53:57] ethameta: are they gigabyte cards?
[2:54:05] zvidrvhim: So it resets
[2:54:12] yeslewd: that would be a big oversight
[2:54:13] Dimomid: it's not minecraft guys
[2:54:15] warkid123: @tortilluh it should only despawn visually, not in the database which matters more
[2:54:21] mariuspure: but weed once dried when you woke up so that theory doesn't work
[2:54:23] ghutta: stuff in appartments "despawn" as well unless you walk into the apartment no? and weed dries there
[2:54:27] kodakuma_: it doesnt dry when someones there weed getting ai before hoomans
[2:54:28] Celascion: i thought the weed shortage is city wide?
[2:54:34] ghutta: as in, it "dried" there rpeviosuly
[2:54:42] zvidrvhim: Cuz the room thing is new
[2:54:43] gostonko: ocular occlusion on database calculations BebeLa
[2:54:53] Dentvis: make someone sit there for hours mhm
[2:55:00] fraudiola9: ok I saw  it Buddha where he created rooms and. put the computer rack in another folder so it was mining less btc so it might be that @nidas sorry for backseating
[2:55:01] 911_raj: Can we sell this house
[2:55:14] rikzoo: RPSupervisor
[2:55:15] slorebear: Travs weed dried while he was being a lumberjerk
[2:55:16] kodakuma_: i mean there should be logging for most things
[2:55:21] IKEA_DOG: there's no way it was loaded for exactly 6 minutes only when u collected that's a wild coincidence
[2:55:30] allotras: it works normally for rooms too in other houses
[2:55:48] zvidrvhim: One way to try and prove the theory is have someone sit in the area for an hour i guess @nidas
[2:55:59] meego0o: its either the house is haunted  or its 4head
[2:56:10] gurglet: but the computer worked the whole hour so it wasn't because of unloading
[2:56:26] realitijd24: mhm  last resort
[2:57:53] Noccturnalll: does each one need a full 10 does the 9 in 1 and 1 in 1 mess it up
[2:58:22] LePtitGrec75: maybe its the case for the butcoin too
[2:58:24] senlash: a room within a room RPDirector
[2:58:31] senlash: within another room
[2:58:40] spolito12: weed drys in the apartments so I doubt thats the issue
[2:58:47] ObamaBinDroning: RPDirector
[2:58:55] kodakuma_: have you tried using the windblower on the weed Kappa
[2:59:19] gostonko: if instancing was the issue the devs wouldnt be worth shit
[2:59:27] IKEA_DOG: aren't apartments instanced the same way as houses?
[2:59:37] sharky_00_: OK
[3:00:31] ethameta: hopefully someone didn't trade them all out for msi gaming x's
[3:00:38] timbres: If this group didn’t have Ming I think Ingevar would actually go crazy
[3:00:44] IKEA_DOG: Yeah but maybe rooms are instanced differently, they're like an instance in an instance
[3:01:13] fraudiola9: yeah
[3:01:16] jinxedluck: too much heat, humidity etc bricking the racks?
[3:01:30] fraudiola9: it might just fix it
[3:01:31] yeslewd: Shrug
[3:01:34] jojaha: keep the room and some racks in there, move other rooms to a "nonroom"
[3:01:39] Lenny_Kibbutz: yeah but the rooms let you have more objects placed
[3:01:44] jojaha: others racks*
[3:01:51] enar_ixo: Have the rooms even helped with the loading issue?
[3:01:58] IKEA_DOG: maybe keep 1 rack or something in a room to see if there's actually a difference?
