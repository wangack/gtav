[5:31:46] SmoothAssKiwi: At what's for breakfast
[5:31:55] SmoothAssKiwi: So
[5:32:03] itsmemusicforcars: there’s no more confusion about what items are “seen” when frisking for weapons anymore. it’s such a smart solution

[5:41:39] Beerman155: is there any issue with him reading the report before going on the stand?
[5:43:59] Faikkun: can the witness address the judge like this generally?
[5:44:02] Pilatian: You were right, they should've put Louis up first, Muller has been on the stand this long KEKW
[5:44:04] Vooklife: Classic penta trial
[5:44:06] Herman_Miller_1114: 2/3 of the way through 1 witness.

[5:45:28] MeggidoMuneblaze: penta is starting to get under their skin

[5:45:57] Mediamessiah: I agree get them a high chair

[5:47:38] HyperGenics: NO way they call louis
[5:48:15] MeggidoMuneblaze: Jordan did list louis as one of his witnesses
[5:48:59] Beerman155: he's not even in courtroom anymore
[5:49:04] Pilatian: Well, there goes Burton
[5:49:59] Pilatian: I think they need to get rid of all that crap on the witness stand, makes them look like they're in a little fortress
[5:50:30] clever_username__: just need to clear the clutter
[5:50:34] Pilatian: Just replace it all with a MDW to reference if needed MDW monkaHmm
[5:50:43] epicachilles: The main issue imo is those huge cornerposts on the main judge desk

[6:04:38] bruhkewl: I wonder why Penta doesn't just roll a defense attorney.
[6:04:52] Pilatian: @bruhpyka Hates driving around until something happens, it's reactive rather than proactive
[6:04:58] Kold87: because then he would have to do paperwork
[6:05:02] HyperGenics: Objection count is at 53. 34 for Jordan 19 for ADA.
[6:05:10] laerin101: takes work away from lawyers and adas

[7:05:33] boolove: i wish someone would actually explain hearsay
[7:05:59] Pilatian: A rare objection to actually see succeed in this venue
[7:06:50] notpatrickjrm: welp
[7:07:27] mercifullrs: Food part? Sink chicken?
[7:07:30] Archaius: its fucked up that the label was still on the gun
[7:07:50] boolove: thats correct sorta
[7:07:55] Archaius: especially bc as a normal civ you cant see that the label is on it right?
[7:07:58] wellingtonsmom: Even if there's a medical report in the file?
[7:08:19] boolove: you heard what you heard
[7:08:30] Pilatian: Nolan can sleep soon POGGERS
[7:08:50] boolove: LMAO
[7:08:58] Pilatian: Were you? Madge
[7:09:57] notpatrickjrm: hes trying to get somewhere very specific sounds like
[7:10:10] Pilatian: It sounds like he's trying to get testimony for a civil suit
[7:10:22] bruhkewl: wasn't this answered in testimony?
[7:10:28] d0ubleDang: So many objections....
[7:11:04] fighting_leprechaun: hello
[7:11:06] boolove: shes shotgunning spaghettis objections - @d0ubleDang i think shes limit testing just to udnerstand how the system works
[7:11:17] Proloe: Nah
[7:11:19] ZaffreBlaze: She has literally objected to practically every question he's asked.
[7:11:23] yoyomancoolman: thats jordan PepeLaugh
[7:11:27] Pilatian: That was the balance earlier but after the five minutes from the ADA I think it might be even
[7:11:31] Llamas: i'd say its pretty close to 50/50
[7:11:32] boolove: Jordan is the gas lighting god - you know this
[7:11:35] roguegunslinger1: Well it depends on if you count the time sshe ahd to give 3 objections to find tthe right one
[7:11:35] teadawg0: Someone had a count earlier
[7:11:37] bruhkewl: I was keeping score, but my clicker broke
[7:11:40] Proloe: He was very chill and just started doing what she does, but i'm down for a recount LUL
[7:11:41] baggagelizard: you know jordan, Jordan's always the victim Gladge
[7:11:41] Archaius: she is throwing like 5 objections at a time
[7:11:54] fighting_leprechaun: what is this case about?
[7:11:54] Pilatian: Lookinge
[7:11:54] franktrain_: this latter half shes thrown out a lot more
[7:11:55] wellingtonsmom: They both object a ridiculous amount, even when they're stopping a question that helps their own side
[7:12:03] ZaffreBlaze: Yeah and she's machine gunning objections until she gets one that works
[7:12:13] awkward_penguinz: Mmm. Gaming burger.
[7:12:43] Pilatian: did he just slam his desk
[7:12:43] yoyomancoolman: KEKW

[7:13:04] TheSkyfarer: yes
[7:13:04] Anonyless: yes
[7:13:05] Pilatian: I think so KEKW
[7:13:06] Herman_Miller_1114: yep
[7:13:06] mercifullrs: I need an objection emote
[7:13:08] Razakka: yes Lol
[7:13:17] Archaius: i imagine they just had the sidebar about these objections LUL
[7:13:25] boolove: mantis ?
[7:13:43] rick_stevenson5: It's Murphy
[7:13:43] wellingtonsmom: Because this trial wasn't long enough
[7:13:46] genuinemood: Objection emote is a good idea
[7:13:51] mercifullrs: That's the mirror park predator
[7:14:32] Archaius: classic jordan steele trial, 4h trial min
[7:14:35] d0ubleDang: They're not even real plants. They're fake plants
[7:14:41] YourKokoro: Joy is losing it LUL
[7:15:24] boolove: .....
[7:15:32] Vooklife: ????????????
[7:15:36] boolove: that was the wrong objection
[7:15:47] bruhkewl: Should get a legal name change to Steal, on account of what he does with the courts time.
[7:16:45] boolove: neither technically
[7:16:47] theconvictedquokka: Going on still
[7:16:55] boolove: they can be both or neither
[7:17:09] d0ubleDang: I love her. She's like a little bulldog
[7:17:17] Pilatian: If only she'd redirected on Louis
[7:17:18] boolove: depends on the witness
[7:17:37] mercifullrs: @d0ubledang more like a chihuahua
[7:17:47] boolove: theres a very strict standard irl for a witness statement being pc
[7:17:54] boolove: for chat
[7:18:12] ZaffreBlaze: There it is
[7:18:16] teadawg0: OMEGALUL
[7:18:36] EpidemicToast: has there been an objection for literally every question in this case?
[7:18:46] mwat_: @EpidemicToast yes
[7:18:49] rick_stevenson5: Hey some of us want to know.
[7:18:52] EpidemicToast: yikes
[7:19:02] teadawg0: Maybe one or two questions slid by without an objection
[7:19:03] cryogenixx: figuratively yes, literally no
[7:19:03] awkward_penguinz: This case is like grating steel.
[7:19:07] d0ubleDang: I just closed my eyes and listen to the answers
[7:19:16] Drivont: @EpidemicToast like an average of 2-3 objections per question
[7:19:43] EpidemicToast: I missed most of it, what is it about? generally of course
[7:19:55] Pilatian: @EpidemicToast Whether Jordan whacked and kidnapped Louis Baton
[7:20:12] wellingtonsmom: He asked for a bench trial immediately. You can't question when he does that
[7:20:14] EpidemicToast: can you DM me if he did or not LUL
[7:20:41] boolove: @EpidemicToast its a perfect case because its 50/50 even if you watched both sides
[7:20:54] HyperGenics: Not really, just wordy
[7:21:00] notpatrickjrm: @EpidemicToast jordan trials arent about whether he did it, theyre about whether it was illegal and whether they can prove it
[7:21:12] Vooklife: She's taken over the Tilt Murphy strat and is now employing it against Penta lmao
[7:21:15] boolove: form questions are always .. you know during a bench trial
[7:21:17] ZaffreBlaze: Objection: I'm on an objection streak and can't break it now.
[7:21:18] boolove: theres no jury
[7:21:23] Swolebro: joy is too patient. How is he still keeping his cool and teaching when he has been here for four hours with witnesses still on the way.

[7:23:33] HyperGenics: How many overruled objections she up to now?
[7:23:57] notpatrickjrm: at least 3
[7:23:58] Pilatian: Think we're at 2 hours now
[7:24:03] boolove: ironically murphy got indicted on np recently and removed as a lawyer/judge
[7:24:23] HyperGenics: 2 hours in trial. 3 hours for the entire arc
[7:24:29] Pilatian: @boolove Yeah, I was wondering if he's going to go full Reggie and become crim for awhile or stay "clean"
[7:24:33] theconvictedquokka: "I didnt give a fuck" nolan
[7:24:37] breakingchainz: Joy is so patient with the objections it's honestly impressive
[7:25:02] flacidcanoe: @mercifullrs I was being an idiot but I appreciate the non toxic answer lol
[7:25:26] d0ubleDang: Did she just say extra rebuttal? lol
[7:25:48] TheeForsakenOne: Jordan's alluded to an alibi a few times now. Susge

[7:29:05] TheeForsakenOne: Montag Wokege
[7:29:10] Pilatian: Happens
[7:29:12] annie_bnannier: how would they get a picture previous to him entering the car?
[7:29:15] boolove: every time i watch penta, kyle, sabre "no no noooo guys you can do that "
[7:29:23] boolove: "GOD DAMMIT"
[7:29:25] mibbl: but there was no evidence there was anything in steeles truck, but also isn't this irrelevant to this case
[7:29:51] Shibousha: Go Go Goons!
[7:30:02] boolove: and spoilation of evidence
[7:30:04] boolove: yeahhh
[7:30:20] HyperGenics: The other tow being found NO guilty due to the poisonous tree argument really throws a shadow on the physical evidence in this one
[7:30:32] notpatrickjrm: joe Gladge
[7:30:40] mibbl: that makes sense but since they didn't do that isn't the ruling correct
[7:31:07] mlangcs: court rulings just keep getting more confusing
[7:31:10] HyperGenics: it holds water... but not a lot
[7:31:13] epicachilles: can judges add charges in onx?
[7:31:25] Pilatian: @epicachilles Downgrade, not lateral, I think is the guideline
[7:32:03] boolove: latitude given for roleplay testimony
[7:32:19] boolove: but black and white easy case
[7:32:39] mercifullrs: Is that DA the hospital boss above beehyper on ignite
[7:32:45] Dovinger: Is it not better to charge with both evidence tampering and obstruction?
[7:33:00] flacidcanoe: but if it’s not charged at all is that not kinda fruit of the poisonous tree? it should be charged and dropped no?
[7:33:01] Pilatian: May just not have been articulated well, though I thought when they left the cells they were charging with both
[7:33:02] Dovinger: Oh my bad
[7:33:24] Shibousha: There seems to be a trend of pressing the wrong charges.
[7:33:40] boolove: Explain for the class the difference between an inventory and a fourth amendment search Kapp
[7:33:42] Pilatian: @Shibousha And also not pressing all possible charges when viable during contest
[7:33:59] rachelkachel: what state? san andreas
[7:33:59] boolove: i still disagree that supreeme court decision
[7:34:10] Shibousha: @Shibousha They may be worried about stacking
[7:34:36] epicachilles: holy frick I just realised its 1:15 am where I am
[7:34:55] mercifullrs: @epicachilles objection
[7:35:18] Pilatian: Forced Night Owl time
[7:35:40] SunkenTrain: Occams going to be super sleepy tomorrow/today
[7:36:04] YourKokoro: Goodnight everyone occamLove
[7:36:13] Pilatian: Is the DA going for "the witness is too concussed to remember"?
[7:37:09] flacidcanoe: objection. they asked what state he was in. the state was San Andreas
[7:37:18] Pilatian: EZ San Andreas
[7:37:22] AureliaAlys: LUL
[7:37:40] boolove: @Pilatian its pretty much required that you establish the witness is capable of testifying
[7:38:06] Pilatian: @boolove Feel like they should've done that before they put Louis on the stand and not after, but there was the other bench trial I guess
[7:38:33] boolove: @Pilatian they did
[7:38:41] mercifullrs: It's already established Louis will be smoking pot under a bridge with steele. Could cause memory loss
[7:39:14] NotGander: Objection, Mr Steele is not a tow truck therefore he could not have towed Mr Baton to the hospital
[7:39:46] boolove: @NotGander true
[7:40:12] mercifullrs: Who's the Ada streamer?
[7:40:12] boolove: UI
[7:40:16] boolove: UI ?!!?!?!

[7:41:03] Chiracho: ooohh nice
[7:41:31] annie_bnannier: blood Stare
[7:41:47] Pilatian: It'd be cool if the physical evidence could stick to the vehicle somehow
[7:41:48] notpatrickjrm: blub
[7:42:14] Pilatian: Yeah, or if you had someone bleeding out in your passenger seat or something. Pulp Fiction mess
[7:42:50] boolove: shit they couldnt even figure that out in no pixel with triple A devs. it always got stuck to the ground or dispeared
[7:43:12] Pilatian: Yeah, I know it's insanely difficult, just one of those things that I wish the game had even if it's impossible
[7:43:38] OnyxSpartanII: maybe it'll be possible in GTA6 occamCOPIUM
[7:43:45] boolove: shame they still cant figure out red dead player expansion
[7:44:09] TheSkyfarer: KEKW
[7:44:16] Pilatian: 3 hour misdemeanor KEKW
[7:44:26] vNamelessz: objection, bench trial taking too long. result, everyone gets to go to sleep

[7:44:48] Pilatian: Looks like they're getting to that witness PC Boo
[7:44:53] pvtweasel: is Jordans main goal just for no charges?
[7:45:41] annie_bnannier: DESKCHAN contralto
[7:45:46] ZaffreBlaze: I think he'd have been better off arguing it wasn't kidnapping, but he is trying to cast doubt that he was even there.
[7:45:47] Ellzybub: arent we supposed to be chill with objections on bench trials?
[7:45:47] Proloe: LUL
[7:45:47] Vooklife: Objection hot pursuit
[7:45:52] Pilatian: Joy may be the most patient person in the entire DOJ monkaS

[7:46:05] bruhkewl: objection, objection
[7:46:07] baggagelizard: timmy yougman!?
[7:46:08] Manfadoc: Bionic was for sure holding the bridge of his nose right then
[7:46:21] boolove: my last deposition i think i made two objections - one of them was "why did you do it"
[7:46:40] Ellzybub: @boolove thats hilarious haha
[7:47:09] epicachilles: could jordan be going for the defense where the police didn't investigate enough because it wouldn't help their case? I think there was a word for it
[7:47:13] boolove: @Ellzybub im pretty sure they meant to ask a question before that
[7:47:31] decimated___: i'm going to be hearing objection in my sleep
[7:48:05] annie_bnannier: NODDERS
[7:48:12] Herman_Miller_1114: battle of attrition
[7:48:13] NotGander: objection, we are still here
[7:48:16] faefor: objection limit? pausecham
[7:48:16] Lupanix: no lets beat this dead horse until the sun comes up
[7:48:21] ZaffreBlaze: He's probably trying to establish a Brady violation
[7:48:27] kanzler1871: I tried to go to bed, couldnt sleep for two hours, and this is still going on lmao
[7:48:36] Ellzybub: objection, he asked a question again.
[7:48:41] boolove: no chance
[7:48:49] bruhkewl: it's like two little kids that refuse to lay down for a nap when they are exhausted
[7:49:21] boolove: exculpatory evidence is a brady violation - jordan sounds like he knows all the evidence
[7:49:34] Vooklife: So the one time "Calls for legal conclusion" actually applies and they don't object lmao
[7:49:38] boolove: there were no surprises
[7:49:46] Pilatian: @boolove I wonder why Jordan would know all the evidence Kappa
[7:50:15] boolove: @Pilatian all the evidence withheld from him
[7:50:42] Pilatian: I'm sure Joy has noticed at this point and gotten Susge
[7:50:45] boolove: just make jordan a cop again NOOO
[7:51:02] Pilatian: Jordan would single handedly send Bob back to Tijuana
[7:51:27] boolove: bob just came back from tijuana NOOO
[7:51:30] vNamelessz: how would Montag rule on this?
[7:51:34] Proloe: KEKW
[7:51:36] rachelkachel: KEKW
[7:52:14] Vooklife: We need a "Creation of Material Fact" just to complete the set
[7:52:27] Dhaaru: what makes it impossible to say
[7:52:35] Ellzybub: painting a picture of malicious prosecution
[7:52:36] Petering: "final question"
[7:52:40] annie_bnannier: lily pond made them do it NODDERS
[7:52:44] jc_e1x: Don't worry, only five and a half hours until tsunami, there's no way this goes beyond that
[7:52:56] wack1attack1: he is going for malicious by the sound of it
[7:52:58] kanzler1871: @jc_e1x PEPW

[7:53:31] boolove: TIMMY
[7:53:33] OnyxSpartanII: PepeLaugh
[7:53:41] boolove: objection TP LIVE was in chat
[7:53:47] poppa_willy: It isn't one sided but the prosecution has had WAY more
[7:54:12] Ellzybub: i wonder what the sustain vs overruled count is for each of them
[7:54:18] NotGander: open an investigation into whether joy is afk or not
[7:54:25] Herman_Miller_1114: Is real court like this? I haven’t really been before.
[7:54:30] Pilatian: NO
[7:54:34] Pilatian: @Herman_Miller_1114 NOPERS
[7:54:36] boolove: @Herman_Miller_1114 eh...
[7:54:49] OnyxSpartanII: depends on how feisty the lawyers are KEKW
[7:54:54] boolove: @Herman_Miller_1114 ive been to a bench trial like this
[7:55:07] Kiitzu: the Depp vs Heard trial was like this
[7:55:12] baggagelizard: this wouldn't have gotten to trial, right?
[7:55:13] Herman_Miller_1114: I’ve only really watched YouTube clips of defendants attacking people.
[7:55:17] boolove: yeah youd get carried out by a very thick bailiff
[7:55:24] OnyxSpartanII: @Kiitzu Judge A was a saint for her patience KEKW
[7:55:30] Pilatian: The judge would have a fucking aneurysm
[7:55:45] cryogenixx: i'm assuming there would be fewer objectionable questiosn?
[7:55:47] bruhkewl: I hope Juy sentences Steele to community service with the DA
[7:55:55] Petering: @Kiitzu those lawyers were being paid millions, no pro bono lawyer going this hard for these charges lol
[7:55:55] boolove: i externed for a judge in lawschool that yelled at a lawyer for standing too much for objections
[7:56:06] mlangcs: cases like this need to go to actual trial
[7:56:07] boolove: and she was a very nice lady
[7:56:13] Pilatian: @boolove Fed or state out of curiosity?
[7:56:21] boolove: @Pilatian fed
[7:56:28] Pilatian: Very nice POGGERS
[7:56:29] kanzler1871: My wife tried to watch an RP trial with me once and she was going nuts. Shes a prosecutor.
[7:56:36] Herman_Miller_1114: Penta banned from bench trials.
[7:56:37] ASRAP: tbh it seemed like a simple enough case
[7:56:39] Herman_Miller_1114: good rule.
[7:56:39] boolove: @Pilatian state judges are a little bit more lax
[7:56:51] epicachilles: I mean 3 witnesses in this trial would still be like 2-3 hours
[7:57:02] boolove: D:
[7:57:04] Ellzybub: he gets 2 bench trials per week max
[7:57:06] Herman_Miller_1114: Except for block trials. they’re more funny.
[7:57:09] annie_bnannier: one per week only KEKW
[7:57:11] mibbl: but then you could have cops calling additional witnesses to avoid bench trials
[7:57:16] Petering: only chase clouter bench trials
[7:57:18] rick_stevenson5: What about trucky
[7:57:18] Vooklife: Jimmy pentawJs
[7:57:20] Pilatian: @boolove I'll probably go to LS in about a year, though no plans to go litigation currently.
[7:57:22] pvtweasel: they take time
[7:57:24] mlangcs: i don't think people should be able to call this many witnesses just for bench trials
[7:57:25] pvtweasel: true
[7:57:30] boolove: @OccamsSabre stipulated facts need to be a thing
[7:57:36] awkward_penguinz: After a few, penta needs to be benched
[7:57:36] ZaffreBlaze: Three strikes on objections. You get three overruled, you don't get any more.
[7:57:37] annie_bnannier: NODDERS petty objections
[7:57:38] Ellzybub: yeah there needs to be more warning from judges about the objections
[7:57:40] Llamas: 2/3s of them were overruled anyways
[7:57:42] boolove: no server ever has stipulated facts
[7:57:43] Paul98R: i thought it was going to be hard to beat the amount of objections between rosa and leeds yesterday but this has blown it out of the water
[7:57:48] flacidcanoe: I feel like it makes the states attorneys better
[7:57:49] Pilatian: Wait, we have closing statements? POGGERS
[7:57:56] epicachilles: isn
[7:58:00] volazal: once one side starts the other counters and it takes forever lol
[7:58:07] bruhkewl: Time for DOJ to do some training mock cases?
[7:58:14] boolove: the most important thing for any trial irl is a stipulated set of facts
[7:58:15] Lupanix: most my RL experience was with the circuit clerk for speeding/dui cases, much different there also, because most of it is officer say is golden, was he speeding? yes how did you clock him? ok guilty
[7:58:20] epicachilles: isn't some amount of confliction good irl? something to do with witness collaboration or something
[7:58:27] flacidcanoe: but is it the objections that are the issue or the questions
[7:58:29] Dovinger: Closing
[7:58:42] Pilatian: Jordan likes to sneak in testimony as closing and hope the judge won't notice
[7:58:42] boolove: you know when to object to a closing
[7:58:51] annie_bnannier: cops bad NODDERS
[7:58:54] boolove: facts - evidence - modCheck
[7:59:12] Paul98R: when can you object to a closing ?
[7:59:12] Ellzybub: objection, closing argument brought masculine tears to my eyes
[7:59:59] Vooklife: If I did it
[8:00:21] boolove: OccamsRhodes
[8:00:32] HyperGenics: Was it a pistol whip? Has that been established?
[8:00:33] Herman_Miller_1114: Was it established that it was a gun?
[8:00:40] Pilatian: Is there a charge for illegally transporting someone to the hospital?
[8:00:44] mercifullrs: Objection
[8:00:47] Loremipsum21: Jordan towing without a gun will just be pain
[8:00:53] Ellzybub: what gun?
[8:00:54] boolove: @Pilatian im sure theres a dozen
[8:00:58] wellingtonsmom: If his intent was to take him to the hospital why did he make him crawl across a busy street to get into the hospital?
[8:00:59] mr_pazzz: We dont like people trying to whip it around NOPERS
[8:01:31] wellingtonsmom: What's the argument?
[8:01:32] boolove: standing = your ability to make an argument
[8:01:44] boolove: = because it aint you
[8:01:45] Vooklife: That everyone has been standing for 3 hours and they need to wrap it the hell up?
[8:01:52] rachelkachel: oh, interesting
[8:02:03] boolove: unless its a taxpayer argument
[8:02:10] rick_stevenson5: You are law law in
[8:02:12] Pilatian: Damn, I think this is the first time I've seen someone mention standing in GTA RP since the earliest days of NoPixel 2.0 when Coop was researching shit
[8:02:14] JustALemming: interesting
[8:02:14] Ellzybub: but the evidence was still obtained illegally right
[8:02:17] mr_pazzz: It sicks, because Baton isnt here
[8:02:20] mr_pazzz: Sucks
[8:02:29] wellingtonsmom: Also, he was arrested before the rights were violated or the infraction occurred so there's no fruit to poison
[8:03:52] wellingtonsmom: @Ellzybub He's in the back in the red jacket next to Moxy
[8:04:48] rick_stevenson5: Where is gil to school these ppl
[8:04:50] boolove: and then there would be a setencing hearing irl where a character witness would convince the judge to give him parole
[8:05:01] Pilatian: @rick_stevenson5 Haven't seen the Hobo in awhile monkaHmm
[8:05:52] Pilatian: Oh yeah, the admitted assault
[8:05:57] boolove: veracity of a statement
[8:07:13] Pilatian: Shiny Susge
[8:07:24] HyperGenics: Not trusting the victim.... lol
[8:08:12] boolove: hopefully it was a gun monkaW
[8:08:28] OnyxSpartanII: KEKW
[8:08:32] Pilatian: Jordan without a weapons license just drives him to groom more goons
[8:08:39] wellingtonsmom: If he's convicted does he lose his tow license or do you have to have a tow infraction to lose that?
[8:08:42] ChrisTombstone: This was an interesting case thinkk
[8:09:02] boolove: same
[8:09:08] mercifullrs: Same
[8:09:10] boolove: i have depo prep in the morning
[8:09:13] who_is_that_guy_kevin: well there’s no proof he had a gun now lmao
[8:09:14] Chiracho: a wild chris! poggdoggerss
[8:09:14] boolove: goodnight
[8:09:28] Pilatian: @boolove Sleep well, good luck with the witness
[8:09:38] boolove: @Pilatian defending not questioning
[8:09:42] Pilatian: Gotcha
[8:09:46] Pilatian: Well good luck either way
[8:10:10] boolove: @Pilatian might need it KEKW appreciated
[8:10:12] pvtweasel: occams, do you still do law actively or currently?
[8:10:24] ChrisTombstone: Out of curiosity, are brady violations recognized, or a brady violation-type legislation in place?
[8:10:41] boolove: fuck a flop
[8:10:56] boolove: im outro - goodnight everyone
[8:10:57] ZaffreBlaze: They need to take food out of the seizure bag.
[8:11:18] wellingtonsmom: @ChrisTombstone They are. I don't think they call it brady, but the prosecution is supposed to turn over exculpatory evidence
[8:11:32] notpatrickjrm: they got flames theyre super cool EZ
[8:11:39] Chiracho: Toxic admin keeps roleplayer up late on a school night (REAL)
[8:11:44] bruhkewl: never heard of hot pants?
[8:11:46] Paul98R: look like 90s shawn michaels attire pants
[8:14:25] Vooklife: How could Dandy do this
[8:14:39] Pilatian: Probably not guilty on kidnapping, and guilty on the misdemeanor assault
[8:14:49] Ellzybub: i think cuckman was the real culprit
[8:14:55] boolove: hiding exculpatory evidence
[8:15:16] boolove: that you know as a prosecutor
[8:15:22] SickStickss: yeah he prob won’t get the kidnapping but I hope he does LUL
[8:15:38] boolove: oh i found the gun
[8:15:44] boolove: whoops threw it in trash can
[8:15:54] Llamas: what about like a attached report that they forget to give access too?
[8:15:58] Vooklife: So basically anything Pred would do
[8:16:45] Spikee439: so how you feeling?
[8:17:07] boolove: Pred never hid evidence - he was the evidence @Vooklife
[8:18:08] theconvictedquokka: So he still loses his gun license
[8:18:21] Pilatian: Outfucker the fucker Madge
[8:18:24] Vooklife: Yeah, I think just the assault. I hope he gets off on all of it just to feed his ego so he does something even more absurd tho
[8:18:41] bruhkewl: You'll be in court four the rest of the evening either way, might as well toss them all on.
[8:19:05] Pilatian: He probably won't be in court ALL night unless he presses the second assault charge KEKW
[8:19:13] boolove: several hours earlier "penta so i think they can probably get these few charges"
[8:19:19] mr_pazzz: I dont want to know how long that trial wouldve been, with the extra charges mylesLUL
[8:19:34] TheeForsakenOne: Suspending his CDL would probably upset Jordan more than the other consequences.
[8:20:23] Pilatian: Would certainly expedite the inevitable slide to HUT
[8:21:01] imnotmadipromise: good morning!
[8:21:08] Llamas: each charge adds 2 hours to the bench trial LUL
[8:21:27] notpatrickjrm: how close are jordan and contralto to unlawful detainment? PEPW
[8:21:53] mercifullrs: Tow his tow truck pentawATTACK pentawATTACK pentawATTACK pentawATTACK
[8:22:03] xchunkyxwunkyx: xchunkyxwunkyx subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! 
[8:22:08] Pilatian: Now Nolan has experience with Jordan
[8:22:24] PyrokineticPenguin: I'm sure he'll give you many more chances to get those charges in the future.
[8:22:35] meatwadpod: :)
[8:22:40] epicachilles: moon2S
[8:23:59] boolove: once upon a time - i remember this sabre guy workiing to make a workable roleplay version of CACI - and CALCRIM for roleplay.. it took 20 years and multiple commissions to make it irl - hes one guy
[8:24:25] Chiracho: Primers? modCheck
[8:24:29] bruhkewl: objection, sub
[8:24:37] Chiracho: Oilers? modCheck
[8:24:38] boolove: i wanted to sleep 2 hours ago but hes too good
[8:24:46] Chiracho: Stinkers? staree

[8:26:00] joseph28888: and hey occams and chat
[8:26:10] Pilatian: NOOO Joy is dying
[8:26:47] boolove: im having block trial flash backs
[8:26:59] boolove: So anyway I woke up at the beach house, I was at our stash house the billa-block when I grabed a piece and walked out and told siri to call a taxi and he called this dude named BJ we agruged about the price so I hung up when I heard a cat sneaking up on me so I shot it turend out to be my pops so then the 5-0 showed up so I tried to blend in and somebody told me to hop in the car but I "Im trying to blend in" and that when the blind hating cop destroyed my eyeball
[8:27:04] epicachilles: I kinda want someone to do stats on this trial
[8:27:31] joseph28888: lol
[8:27:31] Pilatian: Joy is mclosing it
[8:27:45] joseph28888: joy plz dog
[8:27:53] wellingtonsmom: He's had to sit through all this bullshist. Let him grief a little lol
[8:27:57] boolove: Montague would not stand for this but he might sit for it
[8:28:01] Pilatian: @epicachilles I think someone was earlier and gave up
[8:28:22] annie_bnannier: hmjj
[8:28:29] boolove: "well"
[8:28:52] Pilatian: waiting for the HOWEVER
[8:29:01] boolove: no threat of harmful touching

[8:30:20] Pilatian: RIPBOZO
[8:30:26] teadawg0: RIPBOZO
[8:30:28] HyperGenics: But... beyond a reasonable doubt?????
[8:30:42] Vooklife: Is he sure? Did he hear the amount of objections? I would murder a child to get that to stop
[8:30:45] HyperGenics: Guilty lol
[8:31:03] boolove: anyone watch that guy on britains got talent with the high vis vest
[8:31:10] Pilatian: Not surprising on that, but the build up was good tension
[8:32:08] boolove: BATON
[8:32:22] OnyxSpartanII: THE BATON
[8:32:52] boolove: the funny part is @OccamsSabre actually had a character that was around for the backstory of this 4 years ago
[8:32:55] Pilatian: BAton
[8:33:04] boolove: gemma was around Lot Q when Louie died
[8:33:29] flacidcanoe: @boolove the one who kept taking it off and doing the same thing?
[8:33:30] boolove: and the under the bridge refeerence
[8:34:09] Chiracho: the fucking french accent he added there when saying baton KEKW
[8:34:10] boolove: thats why this is so good for me .
[8:34:42] Vooklife: Good Samaritan laws nodders
[8:34:59] Pilatian: Jordan is such a Good Samaritan, personally putting his victims in the hospital Kappa
[8:35:22] boolove: good samaritan laws in California suck do not help anyone
[8:35:24] flacidcanoe: technically was he working for the state if he took him in the tow truck?
[8:35:34] zacm219: is that sign ever gonna be fixed , "supream" LUL
[8:35:45] Loremipsum21: Jordan "Good Samaritan" Steele
[8:36:00] Vooklife: @boolove is this like China where you need to go back and finish them off or just generally terrible
[8:36:03] Kiitzu: Steele Citizen Law nodd
[8:36:19] boolove: @Vooklife monkaW
[8:36:30] Pilatian: Making him crawl across the street though KEKW
[8:36:54] boolove: objection Mr. Baton died 3 years ago
[8:36:54] flacidcanoe: couldn’t you argue now  “state employees” have an obligation to transport now
[8:37:16] boolove: and jordan didnt kill him or kayden
[8:37:20] Pilatian: Weapons License *poof*
[8:37:50] Vooklife: Beat Jordan and transport him nodders
[8:37:56] boolove: where's john television Madge
[8:38:08] Kold87: @flacidcanoe tow workers are considered contractors not employees
[8:38:43] flacidcanoe: @kold87 but it’s a government vehicle. I’m just saying it could be argued
[8:38:54] boolove: moon2JOKA
[8:38:57] Pilatian: Maybe Nolan is the one who joins JFTVJR if he keeps getting Jordan cases
[8:39:08] rick_stevenson5: Brovo sir
[8:39:10] MagicalSnails: Time for Nolans joker moment occamGun
[8:39:14] Pilatian: The anti-tow hunting posse
[8:39:19] boolove: Tex aint here to regulate nolan anymore
[8:39:31] adzno: I walk past my office at 3am and hear you laughing through my headphones this is a rare sight
[8:39:35] boolove: hes got no one to speak to about his greivances
[8:39:36] Kiitzu: first "don't make me do this" ruling and now "steele's good Samaritan" PEPW just racking them up
[8:39:49] Gadn: Nolan and JFTV duo and nobody is safe within sniper distance
[8:39:49] TheSkyfarer: steele's good samaritan law KEKW
[8:40:00] flacidcanoe: has “self transport” not been charged as reckless endangerment yet?
[8:40:31] HyperGenics: I think the crux was the victim ASKED and was FOUND at the hospital.
[8:40:52] Aladdin3: do you agree with penta that witness statements arent PC?
[8:41:03] Llamas: he explained it verry carefully
[8:41:12] HyperGenics: statements were thin PC but PC
[8:41:30] Ellzybub: that seems dangerous
[8:41:53] mkam225: would 3 burger flippers statements be pc?
[8:41:55] Dovinger: If it's PC is it beyond reasonable doubt?
[8:41:57] ASRAP: Yeah he was saying it's rs before knowing about the victim statement and the blood and he just stuck with it afterwards LUL
[8:41:58] ZaffreBlaze: So gov't employees never lie or omit information?
[8:42:14] Pilatian: Bedge
[8:42:20] flacidcanoe: well there’s some Kyle cases that have only been charged because of witness
[8:42:30] cryogenixx: RP is about talking and people's experiences KEKW
[8:42:30] Llamas: cops would be basically useless too
