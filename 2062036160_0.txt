[1:56:48] QuesoCommander: can you still access the other box or is that locked out too?
[1:57:25] QuesoCommander: weird

[1:58:42] IosefSerov: Houseplz
[1:58:45] JoeayIV: waiting for little italy to move out front and then a bunch of trees block the view

[2:20:20] ReiSundae: Will it poke out of the house?
[2:20:38] JoeayIV: you mean

[2:30:35] JoeayIV: do you hear people better on the phone when you turn the camera?
[2:30:44] JoeayIV: cuz the ringer gets louder OMEGALAUGHING
[2:31:14] punani_06: Not cool bro...
[2:31:19] QuesoCommander: other people can hear the ringer so it emits from her location
[2:31:26] jimothy64: Man now you need to call someone and test it with actual voice
[2:31:55] QuesoCommander: or can they? maybe that's just inbound ringing? future science
[2:32:17] retrowolf0498: So headlight upgrades when?

[2:35:44] JoeayIV: turbo means better gas
[2:35:45] JoeayIV: (REAL)
[2:35:48] jimothy64: Only potential raiden downside; no charger in Paleto
[2:36:02] JoeayIV: uh it mixes the air and gas better
[2:36:03] JoeayIV: for real
[2:36:06] JoeayIV: trust me
[2:36:07] nobodybodon: faster = less driving = less gas
[2:36:11] nobodybodon: duh
[2:36:12] FattyMatty1996: lots of driving today
[2:36:16] retrowolf0498: The only problem I see with the Raiden is it's electric. Electric cars need charging ports now.
[2:36:24] nobodybodon: but also gas costs nothing in 4.0
[2:36:37] darthdin: turbo is basically nos right
[2:36:52] jimothy64: Yep, and there's currently no charging station up north..
