[0:36:03] Fin_468: you can be a gang and do G6, but to then get salty as a gang when ur robbed is dumb imo
[0:36:07] TheJmJ: @Stealthkillah122 Angy it's the smell of dogs. Was playing and giving them pets for a day of watching over a kid. Let me smell like dog for a bit longer before I shower
[0:36:13] Stealthkillah122: Are you G6 WHY NOT
[0:36:16] MeowBez: hi, im here from Reddit KappaRoss
[0:36:24] geckoZen: should rob them even more now tbh
[0:36:25] dango226: its petty
[0:36:25] boy_pt: @Whippy did the dev's tell you anything about adding more cloths for the PED
[0:36:30] lodropna: i mean they do g6 cause its money KEKW
[0:36:37] Valbryn: What does g6 get you besides money?
[0:36:40] Snowmannftw: i like how in the real world, you might be super down bad and resort to crime, but in RP if you're super down bad you might  resort to legal jobs KEKW
[0:36:44] ReinBork: Hydra is a vic group didn't you guys know?
[0:36:45] Stealthkillah122: @thejmj  ohh you get a pass then. As i bet its a good pupper too uhsSpin uhsLove
[0:36:46] ReinBork: civ
[0:36:47] dango226: rob them even more LOL
[0:36:55] splifffany: g6 defenders
[0:37:05] TheJmJ: @Stealthkillah122 Two puppers actually PeepoHappy Such good dogs my brother has
[0:37:11] itsmissblondie: goodmorning zZZz whipFlower
[0:37:16] geckoZen: KEKWlaugh gruppe6 runners now owe dundee $25,000, the think this will stop him?
[0:37:17] Fossabot: Want the best internet in Australia? Save $20 off your first month here! https://aubb.me/rs-cmgt-6cf7v8ch
[0:37:19] balthebarbarian: Especially since all the felons got fired from g6 getting robbed in g6 is definitely going to be on the up
[0:37:21] Argantosnl: they probably see it as 2K for 15 minutes work being lost
[0:37:24] Stealthkillah122: @thejmj okay yeah your allowed to smell then uhsSpin uhsLove uhsLove
[0:37:26] subehh: mohawk looks great
[0:37:33] DrakeNightbane: The issue is you are fucking them by robbing them, as they lose rep over it. Meaning they can't do that job for a bit.
[0:37:36] TheJmJ: msstar1Love @Stealthkillah122
[0:37:41] DrakeNightbane: And thats how they see it
[0:37:58] DOWNBAD_ELLY: I think it’s fine to do g6 if you are in a gang but do it knowing you have a chance to get robbed by crims Hmmge
[0:38:04] ReinBork: Time to fuck their rep more! :D
[0:38:11] Argantosnl: there is no rep loss, only money loss
[0:38:11] dexclamationpoint: ashlolSip
[0:38:12] xKoomer: true
[0:38:13] Stealthkillah122: Your a criminal. But doing a legal job 🙃
[0:38:20] excordinite: Hewwo
[0:38:22] iandrei280: Atm
[0:38:24] geckoZen: it's like robbing a bank truck, they just happen to be the ones delivering it
[0:38:30] Usahi_Light: Yeah it's different than robbing Snr buns or sani some guy on the street, the companyi s robbed and theplayer loses nothing
[0:38:30] ReinBork: @Stealthkillah122 Being a criminal is too hard for hydra
[0:38:34] drimmalor: it's a disconnect between the mechanic and the RP
[0:38:43] simplysebelle: because they don't get paid?
[0:38:43] fuzionender19: yeah but they wont see that
[0:38:46] tomr33: they care about it because your taking money from them wether it's already in their pocket yet or not
[0:38:48] Usahi_Light: ye id never, you leave plenty of a trail
[0:38:51] MeowBez: yeah i think if youre in a gang and doing g6 and you get robbed you cant start some beef over it, they know the risk, why should they be safe from being robbed when others arent. idk seems weird but hey ho
[0:39:02] EvlCoyot: Yeah at least they left a note unlike the ppl that stole your other stuff.
[0:39:04] Mandrenn: I think it’s great rp I love that it’s pvp crime nowadays

[0:39:51] Mandrenn: going to be no one left to rob, just gotta rob indiscriminately
[0:40:24] balthebarbarian: I think it is definitely lame to treat the G6 pallet robbery as being robbed yourself.
[0:41:04] excordinite: !snackies
[0:41:05] Fossabot: excordinite went to the fridge and grabbed  a stubbie whipNom

[0:44:49] the_nastynate: benji kinda fucked you, brought it up , became an issue and you lost 25k , what did he lose?
[0:44:50] Stealthkillah122: uhsLove uhsLove
[0:44:57] balthebarbarian: 20-25k in dmg over a 2k job being lost lol  Plus if they heard benji say they might be hydra and then they finally say they are hydra seems like a gambit
[0:45:08] Pr0t0M1nd: PepegaAim
[0:45:12] Sigfred42: Let's be honest... the BBMC test is... If you are BBMC say Cunt
[0:45:17] tomr33: I think ppl getting back because they were robbed doing a legal job then retaliate with a gang is kinda mixing gang and civ life into one
[0:45:19] EyeScraem: @balthebarbarian they also lose rep and the time it takes to get back to that rep
[0:45:19] worldwidechoo: they don’t really lose $ any ways. they can just redo the job
[0:45:21] l0uiise: Strimmer , Tom whipHi whipFlower

[0:47:43] skutza: people did that to dundee in 3.0 and they weren't even hydra KEKW
[0:47:50] drimmalor: if someone unprompted asked if i was hydra i'd be inclined to say yes whipHmm
[0:47:51] sao_mito: hasn't that happened in the past?
[0:47:54] Fossabot:  Whippy returns to NoPixel! - https://youtu.be/dvWQK7hZbgM
[0:47:55] al_ex: especially after benji says "they might be hydra", they could've taken the opportunity
[0:47:56] JUST_LOCO_: Yeah in character they would definitely be at the top of my shit list lol
[0:48:02] Argantosnl: good way for a gang do make sure people will not fuck with the gang. Can hurt future cooperation
[0:48:07] EditorDeb: they dont have masks in city yet?
[0:48:13] iandrei280: No
[0:48:21] GordonFreebase: people should just run g6 and say they are hydra now
[0:48:24] S0ESJE: Okay but yall asked who they were with they said Hydra
[0:48:25] Valbryn: I would say yes to anything if it gets me from being robbed

[0:48:28] KozmicLuis: Seaside still has the tattoo
[0:48:30] Pr0t0M1nd: they fucked with Dundee most not take him seriously
[0:48:30] shacklyn: so, admc and hydra g6 drivers are untouchable, apparently
[0:48:30] KozmicLuis: but no mask
[0:48:32] bjornirnsidee: Yeah that's what I'm referring to, they could have just called you before sending you way behind to clear it
[0:48:39] EditorDeb: right so... why not air on the side of caution?
[0:48:51] ethan2233465: sending love from Hydra swizzmHeart swizzmHeart swizzmHeart swizzmHeart swizzmHeart

[2:32:04] ImGenX: SingsNote SKIRT, SKIRT, UH, SKIRT SingsNote
[2:32:04] FriendlyAF88: Ed sheeran was a rapper before he was a singing, look up ed sheeran and devlin
[2:32:21] MDCproject: If someone else wrote it, and it was spoken work/flow, it would just take practice and a number of takes.
[2:32:34] SalemJade: Ask Sooty to help you with the lyrics
[2:32:38] Lunar_Delta: Can we write it and you sing it
[2:32:51] ausgrimreaper84: any one have link to sootys song

[2:33:31] RAYoLight67: you want a discreet dis track, something like “the dogs are After Dundee can’t catch me nor the BBMC, After Dundee the Muts Can’t see
[2:33:35] Fellowpine6: I feel as though you’re going to talk about writing a song, but never do it
[2:33:38] seb_izak: lmaoo
[2:33:53] StageName: Dont worry in a couple years SORA will make whole movies from a script
[2:33:56] yolfiic: @daksplitter it’s a motor club not a motorcycle club
[2:34:08] KitKatSNAAAACKS: @TripleSixAkuma_ She's on Soundcloud. I think under Madame Gandalf
[2:34:09] MDCproject: Also, using AI is not your intellectual property, so you can never claim it as yours.
[2:34:23] OpyPhupapy: Sing about picking up a patch, left in the dust, that still fit you just like a glove... @Whippy
[2:34:39] Kinson1: @KitKatSNAAAACKS Yeah, that is her streamer name

[2:35:30] yolfiic: @daksplitter yeah, it’s different. instead of a president they have a prime minister
[2:35:30] geckoZen: you just need to sit down and write a song, give it a few weeks. you can do it
[2:35:31] Brewserker: there it is. don't think, just flow
[2:35:36] Valbryn: Lock it and save it
[2:35:38] Djeemy: clip it
[2:35:41] PartialBloom: hearing other characters talk about Dundee made me think you had a full squad
[2:35:47] Fossabot:  whipStinky Please do not tell streamer what to do or how to do it unless specifically asked by streamer, even if he forgets or doesn't see something. Back-seating acts as an unwanted external influence to the roleplay.
[2:35:51] General_jainobi: deeroc1Eyes our strimma is a rappa
[2:35:51] Kinson1: Release Norman Bones on the ADMC .. but he might just end up joining them or becoming their leader? heh
[2:35:54] gizzmoharding: YOUR AUTSTIC
[2:35:58] yolfiic: 💀
