[4:22:57] bukuvuking: court rp in beach vigo sounds fun :)
[4:22:58] rj_snow: yea probably any lawyer will should be able to get this knocked down from sale to just possession
[4:22:59] HandsoftheStringPuller: Cop RPers ALL should be evil. There are no good cops
[4:23:00] cannedbirdfeathers: just say you were selling the snuff film which is very legal to sell
[4:23:01] cheesetones: so in this rp does having any sort of cash bill bring consequences?
[4:23:03] terricow: @cerendipidi yeah do people here just want cops to drive around and do nothing? LUL
[4:23:06] Tommer_Man89: ACAB

[4:23:35] moth__socks: @cerendipidi ok but RP is fine, doing no RP and arresting someone with literally 0 proof and giving them no choice to do anything but be arrested is not RP
[4:23:37] FlLLUP: this is a bit much for an rp server
[4:23:37] AsheUmbra: Guys remember this is just a video game and theyre just playing the cops

[4:55:38] bukuvuking: PREACHER BROTHER
[4:55:40] ddoublecheekedup: yeah when she said they just sit there and watch until you do something illegal is wild.
[4:55:41] AutumnBomb101: yeah. This server needs a HARD cutoff on police numbers

[4:55:55] thomasl: Here come the anti police children. Cmon people
[4:55:55] ChexicanLord: server is in early stages where criminals can't do anything so it is a cop server where everyone is cop
[4:55:56] boolin68: criminals need a union
[4:55:56] Brawler16: horrible experience
[4:55:56] locust_farm: Yeah, its not fun for anyone who isn't a cop
[4:55:57] Scionne: the police takes themselves waaaaay too seriously for entertaining RP
[4:55:57] Hrockle: Wait, your plea led you to 10 months AND a fine? What was your lawyer doing?
[4:55:58] thorangar: Nova’s very good at their job
[4:55:58] Mageezer: they should have tried to flip you
[4:55:58] ShinobiHeff: 1 hour is 5 years? is my math right?
[4:55:59] FlLLUP: meanwhile there was like no doctors when gladys got stabbed
[4:55:59] Tommer_Man89: It would be good if it was good rp
[4:56:02] Nemesis688: They need to like post a cop in the holding area

[4:56:05] animeking194: Kangaroo Court
[4:56:05] aLittleOrcish: they were all WAY aggressive
[4:56:06] Sammynerd: cause people like being controlling over others
[4:56:06] ADirtyEwok: The number isn't as much of an issue to me as the way the cop and lawyer played it. They didn't really give you any room to RP at all, even with you lawyer
[4:56:07] SciFiCHiCKtv: There was no yes and it was Yes stop
[4:56:07] dinkynoodle: cop rp sucks 80% of the time
[4:56:07] FanServ: @Saryn0228 criken's camera is a police camera, they did it the same way
[4:56:08] Fish_Lord_Man: That was honestly awful
[4:56:09] MagicalBoyChan: For a creator server it's a little strict
[4:56:10] PompousAss: So you're saying..... cops are overfunded
[4:56:11] Rocker26a: You had a good RP with cops when the literal owner of the server orchestrated an arc for you.
[4:56:11] beanzpod: BAD LAWYERRRR
