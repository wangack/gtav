[1:02:00] pickleviiiic: Next they'll be saying that EGGS are MEAT.
[1:02:05] A_Humble_Wooper: Proper lemonade is diluted sweetened lemon juice. Made with real juice, no artificial flavor needed.
[1:02:38] Insaif: katesNoted
[1:02:47] A_Humble_Wooper: Heh
[1:02:51] doc_sharon: katesGiggles
[1:02:53] hanofearl: @siirika I would posit that only European Fanta is lemonade, American Fanta is fake orange juice
[1:03:09] Insaif: @hanofearl There are lots of flavors of Fanta, really.
[1:03:19] Dongolev: In Australia, lemonade is sprite. The closest thing to US lemonade here is called squash
[1:03:39] hanofearl: @insaif yes yes, my fave is Japanese grape Fanta, it’s soooo good

[1:46:41] hecktobreakfast: she said it with her full chest like she had a PhD
[1:46:42] spazzles: Venus can't have liquid lakes, it's too hot.  Mars can't, the atmosphere is too cold.  Titan is perfect for it; the atmosphere is dense and thick, many times denser than the Earth's, but also cold.  so methane and ethane are stable as liquids at the surface and don't evaporate
[1:47:22] AshuraX13: With her full chest
[1:47:23] Kthanid: with the gravity and thick atmosphere on Titan, you could literally fly by strapping wings to your arms.
[1:47:24] finsane1: don’t they pronounce Uranus differently now just because 😂
[1:47:28] A_Humble_Wooper: @spazzles maybe it could have liquids that would be solid on Earth? Magma or sulfur or whatever.

[1:48:54] Aarek: but what about zune!
[1:48:55] spazzles: @A_Humble_Wooper If Venus was hotter, yes, this would be possible.  but it happens to be at a temp where that doesn't happen.  though, fun fact, it's hot enough that lead evaporates, then condenses in the atmosphere and rains down as molten lead.  but it doesn't stick on the surface to form lakes or anything, it evaporates too fast
