[0:58:18] mrkmattos: your berry situation is fine , you need to use meds to cure the depression
[0:58:20] YANK5_: More spa things

[1:05:02] OreoMooMoo: With xp rate cranked up. You could just spam craft arrows for xp. (Not sure how efficient it is compared to catching though)
[1:05:10] ToolFool: fire vs grass type = deadge
[1:05:13] amiClaire_: Wiggle
[1:05:22] Quynton: friend of mine snuck up behind Jetragon at night while it was sleeping, and caught it on a 2% chance ball lol
[1:05:54] ToolFool: it's an art to getting them the right health I swear
[1:06:17] amiClaire_: Truege
[1:06:32] ToolFool: you need a shitty move that isn't too op in terms of damage
[1:06:33] SleepingForestTsuki: no false swipe sadge
[1:07:16] Quynton: you could always change one of your vanwyrm attacks to one that is weaker
[1:07:39] Fossabot: Janet's YouTube: youtube.com/xChocoBars | Newest video: me and steve practice speaking japanese - https://youtu.be/PWMI-T7FIfQ
[1:07:44] ToolFool: true you might have a weaker move to replace your current ones
[1:08:02] ImplicitGGT: you can build stuff faster since more pals can help craft than a regular table since only one pal can help with that
[1:08:30] mrkmattos: dang your pals eating good
[1:09:08] Quynton: now with the assembly lines you need to assign an electric to power the base
[1:09:16] ToolFool: coal is so annoying

[1:10:49] JediBob42: Hello
[1:11:11] ToolFool: D:
[1:11:17] alreadyindenial: Janet have you tried climbing on top of a pal sphere when it's in the air yet?
[1:11:26] alreadyindenial: since you have a glider it's a good way to get launched up
[1:11:37] alreadyindenial: unless it was patched
[1:11:52] Quynton: at your level you could to go the first sanctuary island and catch 10 of each of those pals
[1:12:25] ToolFool: I like the pistol for getting pals to low health, idk what level that is at
[1:12:43] alreadyindenial: think 20?
[1:13:05] Quynton: bonus xp is scaled to level regardless of pal
[1:13:12] alreadyindenial: you can buy one from the fisherman though
[1:13:24] alreadyindenial: err merchant at the fisherman place
[1:13:59] alreadyindenial: oh for the pistol toolfool was talking about
[1:14:20] ToolFool: it's nice for getting pals low
[1:14:26] ToolFool: over the crossbow imo
[1:15:00] ToolFool: KEKW
[1:15:15] Quynton: the sanctuaries have strong pals that you probably still need the capture bonuses for
[1:15:23] b_mitch123: I think what you‚Äôre doing is good for now
[1:15:25] ToolFool: more backseating each other NODDERS
[1:15:47] BeardManGame: I have a map where you can found every pall every statues if you need
[1:15:47] mrkmattos: catching pals and killing bosses are the best ways to level
[1:15:47] alreadyindenial: monkaS i dont wanna backseat
[1:16:01] alreadyindenial: is glitching to catch the bosses allowed
[1:16:03] drunkin_punk: You haven't captured many pals so I don't think it matters where you farm
[1:16:12] alreadyindenial: Sadge
[1:16:27] creekhawk: well youre 32 now u can unlock the 2 things for the base
[1:16:28] ToolFool: does the server drop your items when you die?
[1:16:31] Quynton: lol no using the exploit to capture a tower boss
[1:16:32] alreadyindenial: I will not mention the bugs then YEP
[1:16:33] ToolFool: idk how it's setup
[1:17:15] creekhawk: drops items but not pals
[1:17:21] ToolFool: because I full on explored and it was great for xp, but if you die and drop your items it sucks
[1:17:29] ToolFool: oh ok @creekhawk

[1:18:31] drunkin_punk: Your pals wont work as hard when depressed or ill
[1:18:41] wishfulwallflower: the low level pals you probably only need them at half hp to 100% catch bc of your higher level to save a little time
[1:19:13] BeardManGame: @ToolFool ?
[1:19:50] OreoMooMoo: If the breeding farm and cakes aren't used 24/7. You can use it to breed eggs for passive bonus xp
[1:19:59] ToolFool: @BeardManGame idk if we want full on guides getting linked for the rivals tourney

[1:25:53] BeardManGame: Okay :) You can use and ride a boar to rush into metal ores it goes faster
[1:26:00] mrkmattos: since your kindling situation is bad, i wouldn't waste time cooking the berries
[1:26:01] rameij: low sanity makes pals Depressed
[1:26:17] themegapikachu: also cooked berries give sanity bacj
[1:26:27] Vanilla_Coke_is_the_best: They just need to have more fun working Stare

[1:26:58] mrkmattos: if you have meds (sometimes they drop from bosses or are in chests) you can feed them to your pets and heal the depression / fracture
[1:27:12] mrkmattos: yeah you do have some medicine in those chests
[1:27:31] mrkmattos: you really want to heal that anubis

[1:29:18] Sharpey01: @niccicorns Thank you
[1:31:02] ToolFool: am I the only one that hated having bigger pals in my base? I feel like they get stuck on every little thing. I always went for the smaller pals. Same with combat pals, I preferred the smaller ones
[1:31:22] ToolFool: bro they get stuck on EVERYTHING
[1:31:30] ToolFool: and they get depressed LUL
[1:31:50] BeardManGame: Not the big pall are a nightmare in base alway blocking and you see nothing lol
[1:32:38] SleepingForestTsuki: choco miner chocoHYPERS
[1:32:39] Vanilla_Coke_is_the_best: chocoMiner
[1:33:00] rameij: hahaha too many ore but no pals dont want to work coz their depressed
[1:33:13] ImplicitGGT: pizza as a food item is pretty goated
[1:33:28] ImplicitGGT: but you need tomatoes to make them
[1:33:40] BeardManGame: One lucky chicken do better in a cave than a mamorest lol
[1:34:17] ToolFool: I think if you find a shiny they should be smaller versions of pals instead of bigger version
[1:34:24] mrkmattos: yeah i just buy my tomatos and perma feed al lmy pals pizza
[1:34:31] ToolFool: it would incentivize me to get them
[1:34:55] mrkmattos: build a chest closer to the stone thing
[1:35:15] fearme4life: maybe build a chest right next to stone pit?
[1:35:17] mrkmattos: yeah i thought you built them adjacent LUL
[1:35:19] fearme4life: yea ryannn
[1:36:40] ToolFool: did you ever get a fenglope janjan? I usually prefer them over the slower early flying mounts
[1:36:56] mrkmattos: low sanity
[1:36:59] themegapikachu: overworking your pals stress them out
[1:37:00] ToolFool: there's a boss on the map
[1:37:05] fearme4life: west of broncherry aqua
[1:37:06] ToolFool: fenglope that is
[1:37:13] rameij: Low sanity and not enough BATH for them
[1:37:19] mrkmattos: do you have the spas built
[1:37:50] mrkmattos: the spa should help, and later better quality beds
[1:38:00] ToolFool: springs is op
[1:38:07] rameij: or just replace the depressed pal for a new one
[1:38:14] mrkmattos: 0% sanity LUL
[1:38:27] waseexo: üòè

[1:38:56] ToolFool: where is the food stored for the pets at base?
[1:39:00] waseexo: ( chat when is rp gonna happen)

[1:40:14] WOlfikun: what is your workspeed at ??
[1:40:33] sr_hammy: for base lvl u can use the same resources to build the next base lv upgrad, build lv up the base, destroy it a build the next thing for keep lv up the base, little hard to explain
[1:40:39] ImplicitGGT: I thought Janjan wasn't doing GTA after? did she change her mind? :o
[1:41:41] ToolFool: good spot NODDERS
[1:42:05] mrkmattos: how many berry plantations do you have in the base
[1:42:23] mrkmattos: 2 is usually enough
[1:42:24] ToolFool: 2 felt like enough for me
[1:42:24] wishfulwallflower: yes. you can build stuff, level the base and then disassemble it to get materials back if its something you guys wont really use
[1:44:16] ToolFool: what kind of gatherers do you guys have in base? might be missing someone to water or collect
[1:44:18] ImplicitGGT: I think they have planters but no food gathers to get the food?
[1:44:23] mrkmattos: i think you're stuck because your watering pal is isn't working
[1:44:34] mrkmattos: the penguin is sadge
[1:44:38] ToolFool: yeha watering is huge later on
[1:45:00] fearme4life: make sure u got a good planter/waterer/gathererr
[1:45:02] mrkmattos: and i think the penguin is your only watering pal
[1:45:23] fearme4life: the broncherry aqua looks like i can water
[1:45:31] fearme4life: or well i saw him sptting water
[1:45:59] mrkmattos: oh true it is 3x watering
[1:47:07] fearme4life: also, anytime u cook it takes the mats out of the pet feed box
[1:47:20] fearme4life: so u could just be using it all in the stove
[1:47:33] ToolFool: KEKW
[1:47:40] ToolFool: this was me so many times
[1:48:16] ToolFool: have you guys collected coal yet?
[1:48:19] ivis666: !time
[1:48:20] Fossabot: Janet lives in Los Angeles, California where it is 3:35 PM

[1:48:36] mrkmattos: nooo
[1:48:37] mrkmattos: not the tower
[1:48:43] mrkmattos: that's an achievement for later
[1:48:45] fearme4life: you just gotta catch pals

[1:49:41] Banderbear: @udonz They're not animals, they're Pals
[1:49:51] ImplicitGGT: Towers do have an achievement though. I think you have to use certain pals and defeat the bosses with skills. Like you have to defeat one with Foxparks flamethrower skill
[1:49:54] udonz: @Banderbear pal abuse
[1:50:06] udonz: @Banderbear how do we win the Twitch Rivals?

[1:50:25] fearme4life: all ur mats at base
[1:50:28] fearme4life: xD
[1:50:30] BeardManGame: Nothing better than a coffe with a cube of chocolat inside
[1:50:55] ImplicitGGT: Yup. Towers should be saved for the end for sure for the whole team to do
[1:51:06] mrkmattos: yeah cook the ingots in the improved furnaces :D
[1:51:21] ToolFool: coal NODDERS
[1:51:33] ImplicitGGT: Coal farming time... where the real grind starts

[1:52:33] fearme4life: and bought my ammo off npc
[1:52:59] ImplicitGGT: I'm surprised they never put Vicky in the ranch to get the regular pal sphere...
[1:53:09] ImplicitGGT: *Vixy
[1:53:58] wishfulwallflower: Should they be switching out depressed pals on the base?
[1:54:00] ToolFool: do you still have a lot of lower level pals to get 10x of?
[1:54:26] ImplicitGGT: It's there at the base you were at
[1:54:29] anneybabyboo: anneybabyboo subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:54:40] ToolFool: I was going to say I would stick to making the second or 3rd quality pal balls after this
[1:54:49] ImplicitGGT: ^^
[1:55:21] sr_hammy: in your inventory u have the red hearts and claws sell them for gold
[1:55:43] ToolFool: right, I mean after this run

[1:58:07] ToolFool: the catching odds seem so much higher on this server, is it just me?
[1:58:25] ToolFool: like level 10's usually get away on mine with the base level balls
[1:58:38] nowhereman__: hi xchocoo
[1:58:56] TheWandererBard: I think it's 2x capture rate
[1:58:58] nowhereman__: hehehe
[1:59:12] ToolFool: ahh yeah if it's 2x capture rate that would make sense
[1:59:13] mrkmattos: i believe you can run the penguillets over with your mount

[2:08:00] fearme4life: u could hunt a huge dragon egg at volcano, but i didnt have much luck

[2:22:14] hojotoki: look above
[2:22:18] fearme4life: u gotta put it in the base
[2:22:23] mrkmattos: that won't work because it's in your party

[2:22:25] ToolFool: that's the ranch yeah
[2:22:28] mrkmattos: has to be a base pal
