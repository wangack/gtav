[8:16:55] Juginator: like my understanding is for example, the room with the weed stuff, doesn't have to load until you are downstairs in the house
[8:16:58] Evolution2014: @jtenfps Britain
[8:17:03] Shaun_Thee_Sheep: You will lose your patience first LULW
[8:17:14] Juginator: so you make a room for the downstairs that doesn't unclude the weed stuff, and room for the weed stuff, then you link them, so weed room only loads when you go downstairs
[8:17:23] keikobeans: dehumidifier is too remove the water in the air so it wont get moldy no?
[8:17:23] Lenny_Kibbutz: @Juginator yea so he needs like a stair case room and then big room then link that to weed ect

[8:21:42] Lenny_Kibbutz: she might just need a nap if its just her
[8:21:43] mathamyr: doors might be bugged
[8:21:46] Shaun_Thee_Sheep: Lenny_Kibbutz it's just that there isn't documentation on the things that the devs have made necessary for the building to function properly

[8:43:05] NoLastChance: sayeed said ooc he has no idea how it works, he just assumed
[8:43:20] ZerZom: maybe the strain is decaying or maybe because Benji is bushing ZAZA in sandy too
[8:43:25] 1evilshark: what about more ppl. like julian and azazel
