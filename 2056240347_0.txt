[3:00:44] tfw_badfeel: you stayed in 5th gear too much, shifting down would have made you accelerate faster
[3:00:45] jimothy64: Okay is the clutch actually mechanically a thing, and has tessa actually been using her clutch
[3:00:46] VzzionFourEyes: it means you can upshift and downshift without holding the clutch
[3:00:51] QuesoCommander: @Darth_hedgehog nakkiHug
[3:00:54] mgFray: IRL... in the distant past.. sequentals were more fragile and often shifted slower then a clutch.. modern sequentals though, much better performance

[4:58:10] OrestesTheSloth: It can irl. For those fancy Persian ones
[4:58:16] darthdin: some irl rugs can be that expensive
[4:58:19] jimothy64: It's probably some stupid complicated way to get them that's causing the markup.. like early furniture was expensive because you had to sewer dive
[4:58:26] IosefSerov: Yeah but they just want the cheap Wish rug
[4:58:30] nobodybodon: that would be 833 materials at 6 each for it to be that much (at cost)
[4:58:39] nobodybodon: aint no way its more than like, 100

[4:59:52] jimothy64: I remain convinced; aesthetic items should be free. Mechanical should cost. Walls and floors maybe.

[5:06:28] IosefSerov: Some nice plastic rug...
[5:06:30] jimothy64: Like, rugs being made from pelts makes close to no sense. It ain't a bearskin rug... polyester exists... cotton exists...
[5:07:11] Winston_Moriarty: hemp
[5:07:12] IosefSerov: I mean rugs aren't usually made of critters anymore.
[5:08:47] jimothy64: Exactly. The 4k pricetag makes sense if it's like an actual bearskin but.. we're just looking for a polycotton blend here.. I have larger rugs than the one tessa wanted and they didn't cost even 100
[5:09:38] ThatSoKyuRo: you need windows ü™ü LUL

[6:00:02] JoeayIV: im still not sure that applies
[6:00:05] nobodybodon: that doesn't really make sense
[6:00:16] JoeayIV: you wouldn't be doing the fleeing
[6:00:23] nobodybodon: I think they mean getting in a passenger seat to evade?
[6:00:24] QuesoCommander: just a vehicle, any vehicle
[6:00:27] nobodybodon: but that should just be evading
[6:00:29] JoeayIV: yea
[6:00:30] JoeayIV: like
[6:00:31] nobodybodon: accomplice
[6:00:32] jimothy64: So I'm like 90% sure that's meant to be for people who get picked up by their buddy while fleeing, but its horribly worded
[6:00:38] JoeayIV: either they have to prove intent
[6:00:40] CreatureBruhh: passenger doesn't really have a say
[6:00:44] JoeayIV: or they arrest everyone thats a passenger
[6:00:57] hellrqiser: is that's yours ? OMEGALUL
[6:01:00] DestroyerOfFatez: That is a weird one
[6:01:07] jimothy64: Yeah shouldn't apply to somebody already a passenger before any fleeing
[6:01:09] Azure505: yeah so by this wording you could get hit with that charge if you get kidnapped and are in a fleeing car
[6:01:18] QuesoCommander: yeah that seems like the intent

[6:03:23] jimothy64: Like straight up that part should be dropped because accomplice to Evading exists
[6:04:15] nobodybodon: IDK dawg, you said a lot of words but the bottom line is fleeing in a car isn't resisting arrest
[6:04:18] nobodybodon: in any situation
[6:04:22] nobodybodon: its evading nodd
[6:04:29] owlicus: ^
[6:04:36] jimothy64: I mean, if you get in somebody's car with the knowledge they're gonna evade, then that's accomplice. Which is what that line is attempting to cover needlessly
[6:04:44] owlicus: (just coming in now but thats how i understand it)
[6:04:49] nobodybodon: resisting arrest is either too light a charge or doesn't apply
