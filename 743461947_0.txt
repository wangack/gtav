[1:15:56] tjones3323: Con originally went left past Paleto, but turned back the other way
[1:15:58] dominusmessorem: Yeah there was a great chance that 911 call could've been ignored, I mean the only reason the cops were there was because of the street racers.
[1:16:00] MeiYap: @xcrash283x uhnHug I'm glad you defended the operation vadeD it's so hard being creative
[1:16:03] xcrash283x: @UberHaxorNova i will say that the interesting thing was the car had bullet holes in the cops eyes XD

[5:17:29] jakb007: I doubt either of them will get involved I just dont think they will be happy it is happening over the blood in blood out shit
[5:17:32] crimsonxtr: this is the same guy that was prepared to shoot olga last week
