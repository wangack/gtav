[0:29:29] JoeayIV: bro they installed some poggers heat pumps in my house
[0:29:34] ToneCapon3: that 3m filter must be changed
[0:29:38] retrowolf0498: I don't have to worry about that. I use hot water to heat my house.
[0:29:51] JoeayIV: for the first time in 26 years i have central AC and a heater that works 10x better than before
[0:29:59] retrowolf0498: It's annoying when it's below zero though and I have to go check the boiler

[0:30:48] CreatureBruhh: West coast best coast
[0:30:48] JoeayIV: takes all the heat from outside
[0:30:49] TinIsARobot: Yeah, really should change that filter like every 3-6 months, makes it more power efficient and tends to save money :P
[0:30:49] nobodybodon: isn't that just a radiator?
[0:30:52] JoeayIV: and pumps it inside
[0:30:57] zombiereagan85: i wish living in Washington State

[0:49:27] retrowolf0498: is with messes up
[0:49:47] zombiereagan85: exciting
[0:50:33] IosefSerov: I think the funnest thing is when she runs into the crims she knows or knew prior and they see her creeping slowly toward that life.
[0:50:50] JoeayIV: shes probably gonna do more crime, but just as smart about things
[0:50:54] retrowolf0498: I truly hope your first actual arrest is someone from the former Rangers.
[0:51:26] IosefSerov: I hope it's Flippity Floppity that catches her red handed.
[0:51:41] IosefSerov: The shock will be amusing
[0:51:49] Chiracho: man.. flop arresting tessa would be perfect lol
[0:51:53] retrowolf0498: I'm kinda hoping it's Tips. Especially with that jaywalking rant he went on about.
[0:52:42] retrowolf0498: @IosefSerov I mean York gave us a really good reaction when she detained her.
[0:52:51] IosefSerov: Yeah that was good lol

[0:53:23] IosefSerov: Yeah it just came off as so uncomfortable
[0:53:58] Chiracho: the shock when the mask came off was great, and then aziz constantly saying "this breaks my heart"
[0:54:00] Chiracho: lol
[0:54:30] IosefSerov: Yeah those were some crocodile tears from Aziz lol
[0:54:36] retrowolf0498: I don't think most people who returned to the PD from 3.0 expected to see a former HC member doing crime willingly.
[0:55:01] ingridktravels: I've enjoyed the court RP so far in 4.0

[1:16:54] nobodybodon: I have never broken a bone
[1:17:09] nobodybodon: except for probably my pinkie toe at least twice, but I never went to a doctor
[1:17:13] CreatureBruhh: don't do it, it isnt fun
[1:17:26] JoeayIV: does breaking the cartridge in your nose count as breaking a bone?
[1:17:29] alphawolfgrave: Fractures are more painful
[1:17:32] Chiracho: would you count a fracture as a break? or only a clean break as a break?
[1:17:38] JoeayIV: cuz that was a broken nose
[1:17:43] JoeayIV: but its not a bone
[1:17:51] nobodybodon: I don't think it does
[1:18:02] nobodybodon: I think it needs to be a bone snapped in two that goes in a cast
[1:18:06] Chiracho: well me neither KEKW
[1:18:17] nobodybodon: or a splint if its fingers I guess, cause you don't cast those hmjj
[1:18:40] CreatureBruhh: broke my collar bone, needed surgery, wasn't fun
[1:19:04] wardmatt1: i broke my arm at 4 years old on a slide. i was terrified of the saw they used to remove the cast. the doc remembered my screams from the fear 30 years later.
[1:19:43] CreatureBruhh: but I have a titanium collar bone now so thats cool
[1:19:48] Chiracho: worst i've had is a fractured kneecap. everything else was just bruises cuts or sprains.
[1:20:00] Chiracho: pretty good considering how reckless i was lol
[1:20:09] nobodybodon: @wardmatt1 and the best part being the saw they use to cut casts physically can't get through skin KEKW
[1:20:27] funkie: OhMyDog titanium are you part wolverine now?
[1:20:35] CreatureBruhh: little bit
[1:20:39] nobodybodon: this bitch is canadian
[1:20:45] nobodybodon: D:

[1:23:05] jinxx977: is this el tesso? asking for a friend
[1:23:12] nobodybodon: @wardmatt1 oh yeah I don't blame 4 year old you, its just funny knowing that. I traumatized a child in the dentists waiting room once because I had a tooth pulled and was loud enough for them to hear me exclaiming about the needle they used to freeze my mouth, my mom told me about it after nodd
[1:23:17] QuesoCommander: make it 3 and they have a deal
