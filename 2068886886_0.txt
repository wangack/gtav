[0:36:18] ishaan04: isn't a ballpark number equally as bad tho
[0:36:19] CrimsonCarnotaurus: I bet you won't even be allowed to show whatever documents the sponsors give you for instructions.
[0:36:22] manatee900: can you tell us how much your pc is worth?
[0:36:25] 100T__Blaze: sponsors are seperate, they have their own specific individual contracts
[0:36:28] yourpalBrenno: Fair enough AlienWalk
[0:36:35] MoneyTwit: people show revenue on YouTube all the time they don't NOT let you
[0:36:40] diiviisonn: it’s jus the mutual respect that’s all
[0:36:42] B0LT_up: there kinda different, sponsors are private deals but YouTube rates are open source that people could work out I guess
[0:36:57] yourpalBrenno: I have a spreadsheet of a few hundred CPMs of various creators OMEGADANCEBUTFAST
[0:37:00] dangerdude9971: yea mr beast said the he made 300k from a video
[0:37:03] DarkGreatBlade: is it bad for the ad company if they say the cpm
[0:37:05] bigrontheboss19: Why is that a question that y'all ask it's also to intrusive in my opinion
[0:37:10] ishaan04: well youtube is a public traded company so investors may want to know
[0:37:13] B0LT_up: you could, but no need to
[0:37:16] dangerdude9971: but he was complaining about the fact that he spent 3 mil on it
[0:37:17] 100T__Blaze: just use socialblade premium, gives you a ball park figure anyways LUL
[0:37:19] diiviisonn: it’s jus a mutual respect mannn you don’t go telling people that WEIRD 😂😂😂

[0:37:38] rsyncd: cpm ---> cost per 1K impressions dangerdude9971
[0:37:43] CrimsonCarnotaurus: @sameeee because it is an interesting subject what kind of money jobs make plus the unconventional nature of this job that some see as just playing games all day also make it interesting
[0:37:43] DarkGreatBlade: tbh its just interesting to know

[2:11:14] CrimsonCarnotaurus: OF is an ultimate milking machine.
[2:11:18] Installer65: i think thats even sadder Sadge
[2:11:21] funkjunkiezz: why pay for amo when you get cray for free?
[2:11:23] instincts_aus: yea agree

[2:11:25] hampexdd: cray getting Rea.
[2:11:27] ughitssophie: its porn addiction and loneliness
[2:11:28] SofiaFett: they even hire people that write for them to talk with those men to keep the ilusion going
[2:11:29] moonheaddb: Ah yes $30 to message a girl who has 60k other men doing the same
[2:11:30] KrAyZiE_JD3: KEKW  󠀀
[2:11:32] Saircat: lonely and horny
[2:11:34] KrAyZiE_JD3: but mainly the nude
[2:11:37] OpzMalone: Men complain a lot about OF but men are the reason women like her succeed.
[2:11:39] willburf: it’s sad if anything
[2:11:43] microjmack0: parasocial all over it
[2:11:46] Orion7011: So they talk to the AI bot that runs her OF?
[2:11:47] KrAyZiE_JD3: its very sad
[2:11:49] Justice_frog: true
[2:11:51] moonheaddb: There plenty of stuff for free though to pay for it is strange
[2:11:51] SofiaFett: but a lot of them are married or in relationships oop
[2:11:54] CrankyCom: its pre bad tbh
[2:11:56] OrzDemonic: Hmm... Fair
[2:11:58] cheeseman769: 'these men', sounds like youre talking from experience here cray
[2:12:04] rsyncd: But most of the time it's someone else do it for amouranth in her staff replying to these lonely people Crayator Shruge
[2:12:04] VioIe: @SofiaFett thats what most large OF creators do. so do all these guys actually believe amouranth is replying to them personally?
[2:12:07] xxDentwitchxx: ya
[2:12:13] shadowless_warrior: This is basically my OF
[2:12:17] SofiaFett: @VioIe yeah exactly
[2:12:17] olly_s01: nah I just wanna nut
[2:12:17] makintosh64: @cheeseman769 KEKW
[2:12:18] hampexdd: my guy talking from experience
[2:12:22] VioIe: its delusion if u think amouranth is actually talking to u
[2:12:22] instincts_aus: I think also its entertainment not sure  how to explain it
[2:12:34] OpzMalone: I don't understand it. It's free to watch porn lmao
[2:12:48] KrAyZiE_JD3: she was blessed
[2:12:57] microjmack0: it works for her just fine
[2:13:00] microjmack0: meh
[2:13:02] OpzMalone: Well they're weak men tbh
[2:13:04] moonheaddb: OF is making money from guys that have mental health problems
[2:13:06] xxDentwitchxx: yay
[2:13:07] makintosh64: @OpzMalone a lot of ppl think OF is more personal even though its not
[2:13:11] Columnedarc: infatuation
[2:13:11] KrAyZiE_JD3: most of it is done by bots
[2:13:12] VioIe: Hmm
[2:13:14] instincts_aus: yay
[2:13:15] CrankyCom: it was made for a different purpose haha but porn took over
[2:13:16] staycool113: Yay
[2:13:16] olly_s01: do you consider this a form of scamming or manipulation
[2:13:17] SofiaFett: but some are marrried and in relationshipppps cray xD it's a bit weird

[2:13:48] jazmineerose: you have a great perspective on it, its refreshing
[2:13:48] OpzMalone: Ok, maybe I got carried away.
[2:13:53] rsyncd: morals and ethics are social constructs... and individuals can have their own version of these Shruge
[2:13:53] SofiaFett: but it does make us women feel pretty crappy, like hard work and dedication?no. show ur body? yes
[2:13:59] hampexdd: instead of paying for a girls of you should become a sub at crayator TODAY!
[2:14:01] xxDentwitchxx: ya
[2:14:02] OpzMalone: But that's my personal opinion.
[2:14:04] moonheaddb: But none of these men will openly tell there mates they sub to people they know it’s weird
[2:14:05] CrimsonCarnotaurus: @crankycom even the normal stuff they try to promote leads to at least softcore content
[2:14:08] microjmack0: fair
[2:14:09] rsyncd: Can we tell it regardless of the topic though Hmm
[2:14:11] CrankyCom: not for us to judge tbh
[2:14:13] KrAyZiE_JD3: yet somehow having a go at short people still totally ok
[2:14:20] bluesteel525: if you think she hasn't worked hard to get where she is you're delusional
[2:14:26] ExGuavo_: but there’s a reason to talk about it
[2:14:37] AyTonio79: good to see you
[2:14:46] g0ldfart: compassion goes far
[2:14:47] Remssiii: she has management running her OF and stuff, so its mostly horny dudes talking to her manager without even realizing
[2:14:51] DarkGreatBlade: i think people think it is unfair and call out people who don't follow the same "rules" in life
[2:15:05] OpzMalone: Yeah I blame men for the success of OF obviously.
[2:15:08] AyTonio79: missgBED

[2:15:50] moonheaddb: Obviously your not friends that’s fine
[2:15:51] cheeseman769: But we are arent we
[2:15:51] SofiaFett: u dont see male OF having as much success tho isn't it quite ironic
[2:15:54] vicmorrowsghost: Dude's will pay for intimacy. Anything to not feel so lonely.
[2:15:57] Finikith: WHAT wait, we're not friends?

[2:16:16] shadowless_warrior: Mine is weird
[2:16:17] bluesteel525: i think women are less likely to subscribe to a guy's onlyfans
[2:16:24] KrAyZiE_JD3: the difference is we talking to you right now though for the most part people on onlyfans are talking to a company that runs that girls onlyfans

[2:16:35] rizzl_me_this: I think it's just weird and kinda broken how much money people r earning from stuff like that including like sports and like the entertainment world
[2:16:45] willburf: I think it’s bad. There are better options than buying someone’s onlyfans
[2:16:46] rsyncd: Sounds like it is past time to start playing games mhm
[2:16:51] hampexdd: id say there is alot of emotion and mental things
[2:16:53] SofiaFett: ok but explain this cray, women don't sub to OF as much as men, why is that.
[2:17:07] Senior_Sideburns: it’s like we can use you to fill the role of friendship that we need but in reality we aren’t friends but it’s not about the thinking we are friends it’s about the feeling
[2:17:08] moonheaddb: Na but paying for sex atleast your having sex
