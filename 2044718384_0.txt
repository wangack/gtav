[1:14:10] Semantha: I think it's better than officers getting sued on individual cases like with Cornwood
[1:14:13] FinexLive: I worry that, it won't have any effect tho, since it's only a recommendation
[1:14:18] lookingfornothinghere: its a interesting thing considering PD 3.0 was corrupt as shit

[1:14:31] Verycelery: good for civs to have an outlet other than shooting cops
[1:14:33] Icestruggler: The civillian oversight board recommands 1 DAP to Denzel Shiesty
[1:14:38] DeadAssYeetOnEm: maybe something down the line NODDERS
[1:14:51] wavep987: Oversight board should have PD liaison or some other officer for communication.
[1:14:51] urkuri92: I don't think it's. abad idea, but it can be a slippery slope with city dynamics lol
[1:14:54] Alexqc19: The problem is this is a popular vote system so good luck LUL
[1:15:04] lookingfornothinghere: get ready for Slacks to get grilled by the board PepeLaugh -1 speech

[1:20:56] lookingfornothinghere: damn the overlay is so big atleast the 4 boxes
[1:21:18] trailofsnail: what happens to civ oversight if they fabricate evidence to frame officers, since its civs who get more lee way to crime
[1:21:31] FinexLive: probably depends on the issue
[1:21:31] Verycelery: malton keeping a leash on the board might work
[1:21:34] TheEverydayAmerican: ciiviian board should have no jurisdiction in handing down corrective action

[1:22:31] realsneakerr: agreed
[1:22:40] Verycelery: how do you keep CG from stacking the board?
[1:22:43] lookingfornothinghere: the problem is the public consists of 90% crims so PD will just get abused
[1:22:45] Verycelery: (for example)
[1:22:49] BulletGorilla: ya if something goes bad it can be changed or scrapped

[7:36:41] Drkdream: NOTED
[7:36:58] WhyWouldYouGiftaSub: Hmmm
[7:37:18] InvictoNZ: change it from days to fall off, to hours on duty to fall off
[7:37:34] Midbossus: Makes sense that someone that is on duty 10 hours a day would get more daps over time than someone that was on duty 4 hours a day on average.
[7:37:40] aye_see: NOTED criminals who are around more should get lesser jail times
[7:37:40] petterseff: HmmCouncil
[7:37:45] FetchLong: oh yes, finally someone talks about it ingame....HOLY!
[7:37:47] Mic_Stargazer: Longer shift = more interactions = more opportunities to make mistakes makes sense NODDERS
[7:37:49] pupuiih: It actually is a good idea
[7:37:50] Midbossus: all other things being equal.
[7:37:53] Mr_Jhin4: so people that play more and make more mistakes get more leisure, heeeeel nawwww KEKW
[7:37:56] BakinPacman: makes sense but overtime hours should be limited
[7:37:58] Eddie1225: yea
[7:37:59] cjohno20: Cornwood gonna become invincible GIGACHAD
[7:38:00] Eddie1225: idk
[7:38:02] Janman88: benefit is maybe a better word?
[7:38:11] Puk3s: slacks will argue no one should get daps
[7:38:28] aye_see: how about people just think before they act so they don't get too many daps?
[7:38:38] Eddie1225: people are gonna think they can do extra dumb shit id they are on shift for a long time
[7:38:39] Eddie1225: so
[7:38:39] sp0rkehNW: he spittin
[7:38:40] Eddie1225: idk
[7:38:42] Ned15: I mean you have a system to remove points right
[7:38:44] Eddie1225: if *
[7:38:44] cjohno20: You need a Daps per hour on-duty metric
[7:38:47] Puk3s: BUT I do think his idea is decent
[7:38:48] chivvyy: mmm so make it an on-duty time instead of an irl time, good idea
[7:38:52] petterseff: Is it not a privelage to be able to spend that much time on duty alone?
[7:38:55] BulletGorilla: look how many people dont have any daps
[7:38:56] Drkdream: Hmmm
[7:39:00] Ned15: It's not like you can't get rid of points, you have a system
[7:39:04] FetchLong: Flop GIGACHAD
[7:39:05] Puk3s: copied eddie
[7:39:06] manilovewakesfeet: WEAK EXCUSE SLACKS
[7:39:10] Mr_Jhin4: bingo
[7:39:10] cjohno20: Daps per hour = DPH
[7:39:11] Puk3s: smh smh
[7:39:11] Belvai: isnt it only like 3 peeps withover 3 daps?
[7:39:12] sp0rkehNW: VERY hard to track but good idea
[7:39:16] skinnylegend000: so your daps reset every 400 hours or so?  tracking would be a nightmare.
[7:39:16] LordOfTT: at the end of the day it's supposed to be fun, not super serious
[7:39:19] blowaways: the incentives are misaligned basically
[7:39:21] Belvai: in over 50+ days
[7:39:22] Ned15: @belvai  yeah
[7:39:28] Smokay17: Wouldn't being more on duty after getting daps possibly lead to MORE daps?
[7:39:36] Bob_Sanders: Cletus would never try to get away with anything KappaHD
[7:39:39] petterseff: A bit much but has a point
[7:39:40] aye_see: time is not the reason people get daps
[7:39:44] sp0rkehNW: No way to track unless it’s integrated game mechanics
[7:39:50] Eddie1225: @Smokay17 no cuz the ammount fo hours you do would just knock them off
[7:39:51] Puk3s: would think the days thing still stands, but with long hours they can drop off quicker (use discord hours stuff like they used to for payments)
[7:39:59] Eddie1225: if it takes lets say 20 hours toknock off a dap
[7:40:05] Eddie1225: people do 16 hour shifts
[7:40:08] Eddie1225: so
[7:40:11] Konkwistador_1002: doesnt paycheck system track time
[7:40:13] Eddie1225: it will cancel out in the long run
[7:40:13] Mic_Stargazer: community service at snr buns
[7:40:16] blowaways: DAPS are discretionary, so this can be taken into account by the captains
[7:40:16] manilovewakesfeet: excellent police work should remove daps
[7:40:23] Drkdream: Hmmm
[7:40:32] LordOfTT: @Ssaab dude classes would be so much fun, do you remember the driving school guy from 3.0? KEKW
[7:40:34] pupuiih: The hours r better
[7:40:41] Mic_Stargazer: Imagine Shiesty doing multi-hour shifts at senior buns to remove daps PepeLaugh
[7:40:45] BulletGorilla: the solution is dont get daps
[7:40:55] Eddie1225: @BulletGorilla yes
[7:40:56] D00Dlles: Would be cool if it was time spent in the city instead of the out of city clock
[7:40:56] Eddie1225: OMEGALAUGHING
[7:41:00] aye_see: LookUp NODDERS
[7:41:09] Janman88: @Eddie1225 just dont play 4Head
[7:41:11] SameAsEveryOtherDay: What's the threshold for saying "no you wait the 60 days" though?
[7:41:12] citrusMangos: i think slacks is gonna be the only captain okay with this idea
[7:41:12] Mic_Stargazer: the 60 days just seems so wild
[7:41:15] pupuiih: @bulletgorilla this boy is clueless
[7:41:29] xTurqeh: every 5 snr buns calls you respond to removes 1 dap
[7:41:37] manilovewakesfeet: dap him for even bringing this idea up Kappa
[7:41:38] Puk3s: don't want special cases
[7:41:40] aye_see: flop is around a lot and how many daps has he received?
[7:41:44] BakinPacman: i could see turner agreeing if they bring up a solid reasoning plan
[7:41:48] Eddie1225: @aye_see none
[7:41:52] Eddie1225: as far as im aware
[7:41:54] Eddie1225: lol
[7:42:03] Sarcon: if they had the ability to track hours worked then it's a simple answer, in place of 60 days you loose a dap for x amount of time worked. Stinks there's no tracking.
[7:42:04] pupuiih: Most of the time it's not even the officers fault for getting a dap
[7:42:07] Smokay17: Every win against Ramee removes 1 dap.
[7:42:08] aye_see: amazing that people can be around and not do silly things....
[7:42:22] Belvai: from what i have seen also its only 2 peeps moaning about daps
[7:42:31] Puk3s: told you the divide is real though
[7:42:40] Drkdream: who ever gets Ramee DNA is inmune to DAPs Hmmm
[7:42:41] Artsii1994: @aye_see flop is a senior hes that officer that has that check balance.
[7:42:42] cjohno20: Having a "Daps per hour" would be sick
[7:42:43] keemotherapi: @Belvai it was way more today actually
[7:42:48] Mic_Stargazer: @Belvai I dunno it seems like even people without them are concerned about the system
[7:43:09] Count_Brennuvarg: belvai you can say that but I've definitely seen other cops, who dont have daps, talk about the issue
[7:43:16] Janman88: DpS = Daps per Session YEP
[7:43:34] Belvai: aye coz someone spent most of his beging shift going around moaning to peeps
[7:43:43] Mic_Stargazer: Flop is a prime example, long shifts no daps but still concerned about the way it works
[7:43:46] King_Rexy: Its funny to me because only 3 or 4 people have daps OMEGALAUGHING
[7:43:50] Eddie1225: @Mic_Stargazer i mean
[7:43:55] Eddie1225: thats cuz he talks to cornwood alot
[7:43:56] Eddie1225: OMEGALAUGHING
[7:43:57] Puk3s: I would jokingly dap him here but probably bad for teamwork stuff
[7:43:59] Mic_Stargazer: LOL
[7:44:19] jay_jaymann: aren’t there a lot of police who do long hours who don’t get daps because they don’t make mistakes repeatedly.

[7:45:06] BakinPacman: the reverse will also end up being true. People with minimum hours with feel getting dapped for a single mistake means much more than it might.
[7:45:09] brotacloy: TombRaid
[7:45:14] BakinPacman: its just a sweet balance
[7:45:14] Count_Brennuvarg: I mean, Cornwood has over 500 hours since 4.0 came out, and ALL of his daps were within 48 hours. You can say what you want about Cornwood but that doesn't really make it seem like a Cornwood issue to me

[10:55:05] pokerguy18: 1 minute a month is kinda wild
[10:55:07] catloyalist: Is that something that could get them kicked out of Pd or just a dap situatioin?
[10:55:08] Janizki_Fin: @hoanzlgoas that stacks up too much
[10:55:14] marneraiders: It would be so cool if the PD cars would be just Parked and not stored in the Garage
[10:55:15] EsfandTV: Cornwood has 8 M1911's with no serial if they wanna go off duty and take care of business I can go online we'll send that bitch into da ocean dawg

[10:55:45] Semantha: Really doesn't feel fair on those two officers when they had no way to fix the car because of the bug atm
[10:55:46] Janizki_Fin: Actually genius
[10:55:58] Gorillamasks2: What are the chances of it
[10:55:58] skedaddelr: @KellBellnf they could've pulled over and called for backup

[10:56:13] EsfandTV: bad faith RP :(
[10:56:16] Paxipher: the legendary door
[10:56:26] scooberdooberty: this sounds just like Oswaldo wanting to sue cornwood, Esfand only got them to chill by RPing out the entire crappy civ vs cop punishment levels
[10:56:28] Gorillamasks2: Roll into a parking lot and explode other people's car as well
[10:56:31] marneraiders: Any SOP about transporting ?

[10:56:45] hoanzlgoas: @Janizki_Fin yeah than daps need to be corrected, cant bee that a 60 month prison is done in 60mins Real time but a DAP needs 60 days to go away real time. i know DAPs are here so police doesnt go crazy but jailtime is also no fear for crims at this point
[10:56:47] TummyD: I miss the old transports though with breakout attempts, maybe when more guns in city?
[10:56:51] Wiidiis: if you redline a smoking car to much it can explode I guess
