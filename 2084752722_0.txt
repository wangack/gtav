[0:22:14] SlyDolphin: @een1Z should the weed be a priority tho? because that just slows down the other goal - getting the sac
[0:22:19] xdSilly: fucking 4Head OMEGADANCEBUTFAST
[0:22:20] lucho724_: Its a weird problem, cause the gang goal is also a personal goal. LIke the only real gang goal is money right now. I think its more on ppl finding the balance themselves

[0:23:44] rubyn0odle: 70 followers away from 250k
[0:23:46] SlyDolphin: @een1Z you need multiple people to sit there 18h a day to get to 100
[0:23:56] lucho724_: I almost think it may be one of those where maybe not taking a gang cut and raising the tax could be an easy solution
[0:24:07] Theexecutar: jordan pushes and does a job, why don't the rest do that also
[0:24:13] Deadplate: Efmario <--- Remember this, it's smoke forever.
[0:24:13] Estimationed: Weed should be secondary to securing the sac
[0:24:18] naimur13: weed pushing probably the most boring shit i have seen in whole 3.0 and 4.0
[0:24:26] Maxverine: @Deadplate, you are a real one Sisis
[0:24:30] Maxverine: Efmario

[0:24:57] iraffis: Yea but that can't be chance
[0:25:00] lucho724_: I also think there are a few ppl that are happy to hop in a car and just do nothing
[0:25:08] jegget_: ye i can see that
[0:25:10] SlyDolphin: @een1Z thats why goals get confusing at that stage then, one contradicts the other

[0:26:27] pollock_ph: not anyone but im sure some
[0:26:29] een1Z: True
[0:26:41] Demolition1060: i think that flippy and miggy should have a convo 1 on 1
[0:26:47] lucho724_: Pushers need to limit themselves tbh
[0:26:57] een1Z: There is a lot of things that go into it and not just the pushers nodd
[0:27:14] naimur13: you cant compare pushing to grower
[0:27:17] kgenera: growers are making EZ money though, like 4k for 10-20min effort
[0:27:19] khaled_5655: EXACTLY
[0:27:24] een1Z: They set up their goals and then complain about the goals KEKW

[0:28:03] lucho724_: and optically that looks bad for others
[0:28:15] lucho724_: yah, they are part timers
[0:28:17] lucho724_: its a weird spot
[0:28:27] absolo_m: could it be miggy/maybe weed pushes want to be appreciated a little more in comparison to ash and rex
[0:28:30] SlyDolphin: what about bogo (im kidding)
[0:28:41] een1Z: True
[0:28:42] FLv_Smoke: Part timers having different rules is hurting morale maybe

[0:30:52] SandroC: @SlyDolphin 1 week of 4 months lol
[0:30:54] PastelStormzy: It's all about a balance and Arnie Jordan and Sergio seems to found that balance of being able to have money for themselves and also being perfectly okay with giving a lot of money to the gang, not everybody has to be Rex and Ash who give a lot of their money to the game but they still even so they're working to get their own house so they still have their own money

[0:31:38] StreamElements: Be sure to join Silent's official Discord! (especially if you're subbed) discord.gg/snakeden
[0:31:45] lucho724_: Jordan will push 2-3 hours and then do literally anything else
[0:31:55] Estimationed: Like Sergio Jordan and Arnie make money for themselves during the day and push or chop at night
[0:31:58] Shanky_k: Sip tea sntSip
[0:32:02] kgenera: isn‚Äôt Alan close to getting dt anyways
[0:32:04] lucho724_: and now with the day night cycles, the break is built in for you
[0:32:07] FLv_Smoke: Do you think Part timers have a place in the 4.0 economy/balance
[0:32:10] Tempah___: Miguel just doesn‚Äôt want to do the Grindy jobs which I get but gotta give and take
[0:32:10] lucho724_: go make money during the day
[0:32:12] Theexecutar: i think its because migy, allen and others don't like/ enjoy the other jobs and are not willing to do something they don't enjoy
[0:32:18] daisyleeh: sntNom sntNom

[0:32:37] ImSorena: WTFF
[0:32:41] milkydeew: @kgenera yea but his just not doing shit smartly
[0:32:45] lucho724_: Miggy wants to be around others, but isn't willing to do what they want to do
[0:32:46] iraffis: But doesnt have goal
[0:32:48] DilaNell: !discord
[0:32:49] StreamElements: Be sure to join Silent's official Discord! (especially if you're subbed) discord.gg/snakeden
[0:32:50] absolo_m: again i agree with you but sounds like they want to just be acknowledged and appreciated. weed is frustrating especially with hospital visits
[0:32:54] iraffis: That the probleem
[0:32:55] XxGazzaGazxX: maybe leave the weed and just grind until you get the houses
[0:32:58] arocket25: I mean people need to understand the server is gonna require grinding wether you like it or not
[0:33:00] khaled_5655: @lucho724_ ashlolOK
[0:33:01] Demolition1060: @lucho724_ that so true
[0:33:03] LaNarcisa: Sly mwah Max peepoFlower  ruby hello
[0:33:05] mutaint: people have to diversify, which i think is what they want by splitting legal to day and illegal to night - have to do both sides
[0:33:11] roxas_41: cant compete with kj and speedy
[0:33:21] SlyDolphin: even if weed is TWO TIMES better at 100% its still not worth it, no? lol
[0:33:28] een1Z: ppl should not ask for praises Shrug
[0:33:39] r3_clay: miggy is just a lazy bum so nothting new right
[0:33:48] Estimationed: Weed should be slowing down not ramping up atm. Making easy money should be the goal rn
[0:33:51] LaNarcisa: dojaW
[0:34:02] rubyn0odle: chas has a house, car and makes money for the gang :P
[0:34:03] SlyDolphin: @r3_clay grinding non stop isnt for everyone, i wouldnt say "bum"
[0:34:11] dripydryp: i hate the whole grinding mentality on the server ngl watching 4head he doesn‚Äôt grind at all for example @silent
[0:34:12] lucho724_: I wouldn't say miggy a lazy bum, he is actually pushing and shit, but he is just very narrow on what he is wiling to do
[0:34:15] shanef8: Miggy and Alan was away for a good month plus they've both been arrested multiple times for stupid things so losing there money by that
[0:34:22] xdSilly: @lucho724_ ^^
[0:34:30] milkydeew: At 40 dollars per bag sly, the seller could have a take home of 3k per hour is reasonable but doesn't compare to other jobs
[0:34:38] Maxverine: Couple months later I doubt anyone would care about weed if any progression or updates in the server would make more money hmjj
[0:34:39] jamiebeaches: the one consistent thing about the server, it always changes
[0:34:44] lucho724_: You cannot compare ppl to Jordan, Chas, Flippy, Ash and Rex imo
[0:34:56] lucho724_: even Sergio kinda
[0:35:00] Theexecutar: what lucho said
[0:35:06] SlyDolphin: @milkydeew but u still are tied to it if you want to keep up the 100% and compete with two turfs too
[0:35:11] Estimationed: I mean look at ace, man's been back like 2 days and made 50k
[0:35:16] SlyDolphin: thats a downside as well i'd say to weed
[0:35:17] XxGazzaGazxX: main thing is the houses gang grind for them leave the weed once you got houses then its just money for gang
[0:35:23] LaNarcisa: Ace is popping off
[0:35:24] khaled_5655: @estimationed ashlolOK
[0:35:34] lucho724_: i think that's also what makes these convos with you hard for others because you grind more than 95%
[0:35:35] een1Z: yepp NOTED fuck weed
[0:35:36] rob_is_awsm: we turned sergio into proper hydra gang member xD
[0:35:44] lucho724_: So for you there are no excuses
[0:35:51] spacebunz666: maybe Miguel just needs a friend like Arnie did back in the day lol
[0:36:02] Tempah___: he hates it
[0:36:11] KyBuiltDiff: is it that they want to spend money on other things like cars?
[0:36:15] its__tina: its better to do the grinding now
[0:36:17] lucho724_: He wants a house and car
[0:36:21] lucho724_: after that he'll do him
[0:36:28] Tempah___: he said it doesn‚Äôt fit him as a character either but he has no choice
[0:36:36] een1Z: Everyone hates it but the start up has to be strong so u can chill later
[0:36:39] kgenera: he wanted elegy or something
[0:36:44] cardztide: not just a hydra thing, every group has issues with certain folks just hating grinding or civ jobs aspect
[0:36:46] lucho724_: There is literally nothing to have as a gang goal rn
[0:36:50] lucho724_: Other than money and weed
[0:36:58] MrsReaperShadow: true sergio fashion gang over everyone including himself
[0:37:01] Estimationed: At the moment you're trying to set solid foundations for the future
[0:37:16] lucho724_: The gang goal is locking down the turf, which is also sort of a personal goal
[0:37:27] Estimationed: Everyone should be pushing to set that foundation, once it's in place then people can do whatever
[0:37:29] PastelStormzy: It's a balance you gotta find and some people have not found it
[0:37:43] STE_Eire: I LOVE SANI

[0:38:07] pelsen_: FeelsLateMan
[0:38:10] lucho724_: I think explaining that the properties are raising in price is the best way to explain it
[0:38:29] Theexecutar: did ash and rex get a house?
[0:38:36] PastelStormzy: No
[0:38:40] rottini_: locking houses down should be top honestly cause anyone can come up and buy a Sac house
[0:38:47] jegget_: ye it must be hard when some people arent working for the same goal as everone else and doesnt even want their own house
[0:38:47] khaled_5655: ashlolSip ashlolSip
[0:39:08] lucho724_: yup its another 5-10 increase for them
[0:39:10] Tempah___: that‚Äôs just ash being stubborn so on them
[0:39:16] lucho724_: between the price and tax raise
[0:39:17] XxGazzaGazxX: yes they should just let people help
[0:39:23] FLv_Smoke: Become a dictator
[0:39:28] Theexecutar: when it comes to money you should just talk with rex
