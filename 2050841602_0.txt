[0:29:35] Babushka_82: @Cspoons if she need to go then remove cops rp from whole server -.- smh
[0:29:37] medium_5: The warrant have to be changed, best way I see is that the officer who signed off on it has to be available for the warrant execution, so the bench trial is possible, otherwise it ends up being guilty until you can prove yourself innocent
[0:29:37] unIuko: they should have told you that the arresting officer is not around and to turn yourself later

[2:46:03] scr4ppy__: Guess we have no other option to wack the company Kappa
[2:46:07] Daywalkerblade: Until the next Shiny thing comes out like robberies or other Drugas
[2:46:09] chipzandeggz: Or do they need to hit 100 before making an impact on you
[2:46:11] jberg987: Until different drugs get released

[2:46:40] watermelontoboggan: Rep increases faster than it decreases for sure
[2:46:41] Daywalkerblade: Well technically the limit is 12 per strain growers/pushers right?
[2:46:51] neroN_: need to go hard NA
[2:47:19] Xernique: na is working on it but some pushers need rep under bridge first
[2:47:19] WeeeeD: imean after today stevie is gonna be here too
[2:47:33] mrmattic1: Is there any advantage of having 100% turf rep?
[2:47:35] PapaBeek: Gonna need a HQ app for every aspect of the crime world eventually
[2:47:37] CypherCosmo: do you think the devs will add some advantage for higher rep and higher % turf? cuz right now it doesn't seem to mean anything, right?
[2:47:47] BeerMoustache: if NA boys weren‚Äôt Acdc they could do damage but the boys can‚Äôt sit still
[2:47:50] helixsecret: Speedy should get more of his boys into the HQ so they function at the same time
[2:47:51] jeabong: isnt conflict pretty much guaranteed in the future with this rep stuff tho ? company didnt move out and they will want 100% sooner or later and they cant do it with you here LUL
