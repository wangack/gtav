[1:42:55] Noomad: @Spencer1250 in theory the money for robbing a full g6 vault run is like 9k but the effort involved to turn it into actual money is kinda insane, so people rather drive the truck and get the easy money
[1:43:57] Noomad: and i would assume those people just go grime when they are banned from g6

[1:47:35] Lordbidwell: Cooked
[1:47:49] Noomad: @Spencer1250 yeah but you need to move 40 money pallets and you can carry like 3, so you are doing quite a few runs even for 1 truck and the more people you involve the more you have to split the money
