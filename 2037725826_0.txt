[2:19:10] natxdev: so much chaos
[2:19:24] Fastlain: There's a REWASD wave?!
[2:19:58] DialedBets: What about the disabled gamers who need the program to operate their accessible controllers? @hisandherslive

[2:20:44] root90live: What did I just see
[2:20:53] McNipply: ITS DAVID BLAINE
[2:21:04] DialedBets: Apex and call of duty just stopped thousands of disabled gamers from playing
[2:21:04] NClined1: LevioSAAA
[2:21:07] natxdev: ✨i believe i can fly✨
[2:21:41] DialedBets: REWASD does not give aim assist
[2:21:51] Fastlain: It's does
[2:22:15] DialedBets: It uses the in game aim Assist
[2:22:17] natxdev: REWASD is a remapping software, it can help make controllers accessible (ex. the sony accessibility controller). however, people abuse it to simulate controller input with MnK
[2:22:21] Fastlain: Gives keyboard and mouse aim assist
[2:22:23] Sunrealcowboy: Hello Hello my beautiful family hey Juka and hello Rodger Feddererer
[2:22:30] JimmiChill: Apparently the anticheat is just checking if REWASD is installed at all and then stops you from loading Apex if it is.
[2:22:36] Fastlain: Wich is a huge problem.
[2:22:55] Sunrealcowboy: Andrew you somehow look less sweaty hahaha lol
[2:22:58] Diss0rd3r: solid ult
[2:23:02] Diss0rd3r: tactical
[2:23:05] DialedBets: It's so wrong,  now thousands of disabled people can't play games
[2:23:16] Diss0rd3r: it was so they couldnt back up obvi lol
[2:23:16] elli661: didn’t even know it went that far
[2:23:24] FriedOrkaWasTaken: make them fear their retreat
[2:23:34] Fastlain: @dialedbets you can still use controllers without it.
[2:23:38] MrTysnes: @JimmiChill We all know apex anticheat does absolutely nothing, xD
[2:24:22] McNipply: $360 bot
[2:24:24] DialedBets: @fastlain disabled people don't use a normal controller like everyone else 🙄
[2:24:30] JimmiChill: @MrTysnes In-game I agree. But checking for installed programs is pretty basic.
[2:24:35] gball321: sheesh captain awesome with the big new heirloom
[2:24:58] mexicant_23: lol, there's a rat in the tree
[2:24:58] gball321: was that a souble stick
[2:24:59] DialedBets: They have special equipment, rewasd helped them map buttons
[2:25:06] gball321: double stick oof
[2:25:09] mexicant_23: they missed the crypto drone scanning him
[2:25:18] Fastlain: @dialedbets you can map controllers without wasd
[2:25:43] JimmiChill: Pod and Flye ended up on the same team? Aren't they both potentially being bumped to Panthera?
[2:25:53] SnowDayzVT: Roller aim assist is so damn strong too
[2:25:54] SnowDayzVT: >:c
[2:25:57] DialedBets: The program was meant for disabled people
[2:26:02] Diss0rd3r: anyone know aspects of the re45
[2:26:14] DialedBets: People abused it.
[2:26:19] gball321: i think im almost able to finally use mnk full time and put the roller down

[2:26:30] DialedBets: I agree with Andrew
[2:26:44] sithyoda1440: Steam configs maybe?
[2:26:46] natxdev: You can look up the sony accessibility controller Juka, it’ll explain itself I think hisandhersJudyLove it’s way different from your usual controller
[2:26:47] gball321: once i can stop fat fingering other buttons ill prob drop the roller
[2:26:49] mexicant_23: its a re-mapping software, its abused to simulate controller. but People will use it to re-map other inputs. Like the dude that streams and uses his mouth to play apex.
[2:26:59] DialedBets: Maybe an interview proving why you need it
[2:27:12] JimmiChill: @DialedBets This will never happen.
[2:27:19] DialedBets: Exactly @mexicant_23
[2:27:26] MrTysnes: @JimmiChill in theory yes, but spoofing that isnt the hardest thing to do (not that I have tried). We see people like destroyer2009 ragehacking for months with no concequences
[2:27:31] gball321: heal in the smoke
[2:27:33] CheatActivated: Microsoft has Xbox accessibility controllers that are first party for PC so maybe that could be an option

[2:28:26] DialedBets: I've spent thousands of dollars and now we can't play 😒
[2:28:26] Fastlain: You can just use steam for the same thing,  only you won't have the controller certificate spoofing. Wich is the shady bit.
[2:28:39] gball321: i watched guhrls zone healing video way way back im healing in zone 3 if i gotta lol

[2:29:37] Diss0rd3r: gives me so much anxiety lmao
[2:29:51] 1KrypticKal: 34
[2:29:52] DialedBets: Guys it's not just remapping, there's sensitivity stuff as well. I'm telling you disabled people need it.
[2:30:23] Diss0rd3r: good reset by them
[2:30:30] gball321: zone 3 you gotta pop a medkit after like 3 ticks or you die
[2:30:56] Fastlain: @dialedbets, there are other programs for that stuff.
[2:30:56] ImEtherMX: @DialedBets but is it something other apps dont offer?
[2:31:20] DialedBets: The finals just disable aim assist on your account if rewasd is detected, problem solved
[2:31:25] LtKanada: Evening
[2:31:42] mexicant_23: It's rough because the people who do use REWASD legitimately probably do need aim assist. Like the dude with no hands who plays with his mouth, or the other dude that uses it because he only has one hand and plays with roller and mouse... but people will abuse and it comes at other people's expense.
[2:31:46] MrTysnes: @DialedBets Absolutely agree. REWASD is a great software, but unfortunately its abused, mostly used as a cheat and not a feature
[2:31:51] ImEtherMX: genuinely interested, i never heard of rewasd till today

[2:33:23] shadow_luci_: @illushannist not the riiing
[2:33:29] gball321: there does need to be something for the people who actually need to use someting like rewasd cause they shouldnt have to struggle cause of an impairment
[2:33:47] ImEtherMX: i'd really like to know what makes it so different to other software for those accessibility options

[2:33:59] Fastlain: WASD takes the controller auth certificate and applies it to KB&M, that's the problem part, I'm sure the rebinding can work without that part.
[2:34:11] DialedBets: @gball321 yup!
[2:34:25] illushannist: @shadow_luci_ I was in the middle of a fight, the ring was my last sliver of hp as I was shooting someone lol
[2:35:33] gball321: mom may of needed heals and knew a team would push in or something

[2:36:38] gball321: i almost think its better then r99 with hammer points now

[2:43:14] Fastlain: @dialedbets I wouldn't worry, there's no way there won't be another program or REWASD changed in someway so it can still be used as intended.
[2:44:13] GetEmAaron: Wsp
[2:44:14] DialedBets: Hopefully @fastlain
[2:44:28] mexicant_23: @DialedBets i'm sure if this does become a thing REWASD will just update their software to not allow aim assist when remapping the controller straight to the keyboard. Everything else should still work as intended.
