[0:48:13] reagon_plays: @edison2000 mhm
[0:48:13] blakfalt: can you put more than 4 barrels in the house?
[0:48:15] gunblade00: @Ming idk your washer machine is like those old ones the other ones like the indutrial washer and dryer machines.
[0:48:17] MadHuskies: 4head yo Ming das mah money das right
[0:48:31] xflame404: @gunblade00 just props works same
[0:48:35] ComfyAura: makes sense
[0:48:37] fornik8r: 400kgs of washed cash is like $4k i guess
[0:48:51] reagon_plays: @gunblade00 doesnt matter they look of washing machines is cosmetic
[0:48:55] gunblade00: @xflame404 ooh.
[0:49:08] quagiie: Can you maybe put the washed cash in the washing machine again? maybe a second washing/drying?
[0:49:17] iliketowatchsmall: @ming positive maybe this will finally push 4head to do civsnjobs that give actual money
[0:49:18] reagon_plays: @quagiie nope already trued
[0:49:23] muskin6: 1 slot for it to dry and other to clean
[0:49:26] bendre2233: Any bigger picture or are we rolling with the slow burn
[0:49:27] quagiie: hmm
[0:49:28] HOTDAM: @fornik8r fun fact, 1 us bill weighs exactly 1 gram
[0:49:50] fornik8r: maybe just leave the washed cash and see if it goes into the other slot as cash
[0:50:02] mandypyro: is the conversion rate on green ones still 1:1?
[0:50:04] khadka9860: thats probably related to illegal job money
[0:50:05] reagon_plays: i think it dries itself in the machine maybe after 3-4 hours it appears in the second slot ?
[0:50:10] nandbread: pawnshop
[0:50:21] vewybig: can you put cash on dryer rack?
[0:50:25] zambonien: HOTDAM in us they dont know what a gram is Kappa
[0:50:25] AajonusVonderplanitz: 😎
[0:50:33] CustomGoods: what about a dryer
[0:50:40] ModelWrong: @zambonien right
[0:50:41] Gurgle_Firewater: can you pay with the clean cash to buy items maybe? so its marked but cash buys cant be tracked
[0:50:43] lunasaurbee: it doesnt say the cash is wet tho, just 'washed' Hmm
[0:50:47] HOTDAM: @zambonien alexander gram bell NODDERS
[0:50:50] gunblade00: The $100 bill, the highest denomination of US paper currency, also weighs 1 gram. A stack of 100 $100 bills would weigh 100 grams or 3.53 ounces, and 1,000 $100 bills would weigh 1 kilogram or 2.2 pounds.
[0:50:53] Codak_21: Badadan Badadan TwitchConHYPE TwitchConHYPE
[0:50:56] harucanne: Dryer?
[0:50:56] Unelll: i think one slot is designated for the washing machine, while the other is intended for the dryer.
[0:51:14] zvidrvhim: More civ buff LUL
[0:51:20] BlastedRoyal: marty HAS to get the grove on then

[0:51:26] Gay_Moore: the one at the gas station near marty would be insane
[0:51:31] reagon_plays: Pog
[0:51:33] xflame404: woo
[0:51:36] quagiie: maybe try to desposit that "washed cash" into the bank?
[0:51:39] theoil345: civ city
[0:51:42] bugcket: grand civil city
[0:51:42] roustic: damn whoever has the atm at clothing store is ballin
[0:51:42] reagon_plays: you can put more now
[0:51:47] woolysux: don't the bills say "ready for placement"?
[0:52:04] Xpatrol: need to place on groun for drying ?
[0:52:08] Xpatrol: ground*
[0:52:11] despicablewebb: well the cash is washed, wouldnt you want it dried?
[0:52:18] fornik8r: @HOTDAM 1-yen japanese aluminium coin also weighs 1gm and floats on water
[0:52:25] despicablewebb: no one wants wet money
[0:52:39] bkr6249: wallet to dry it in maybe
[0:52:40] Granny_Juices: I do :)
[0:52:44] saziiid: New npc??
[0:52:49] densepls: more crim nerfs and more civ buffs, devs must hate crims at this point Souless
[0:52:50] tenaja22: print new serial numbers maybe
[0:53:04] nandbread: has he tried the pawnshop
[0:53:05] Light1stNight: usually you have to leave ink to dry not use a dryer
[0:53:08] Gay_Moore: crims are down bad
[0:53:10] gunblade00: the wedd plant dryers.
[0:53:11] Pheyerus: Wait wait wait. Ready for placement? Would it be to FILL an atm with money
[0:53:12] Clabberlang: this is the fun of crime life, finding shit out.
[0:53:16] maxlbon: does it say wet?
[0:53:30] BlastedRoyal: its drying maybe
[0:53:35] muskin6: Weed salee
[0:53:38] reagon_plays: place it on the floor ?
[0:53:42] silverxco_: its drying by itslef
[0:53:44] xflame404: civ job = money crim = fun
[0:53:44] ibraas11: check quality of money in other washer
[0:53:47] 1void1x: maybe it needs time to cooldown
[0:53:47] Lenny_Kibbutz: put some on the floor to test
[0:53:48] salem_so: I thought flat money was good money
[0:53:51] RU8H: dumb idea but can you "place" it in your wallet?
[0:53:54] maxlbon: dont think you need to dry that
[0:53:54] BlastedRoyal: im telling you, put it on the floort
[0:53:55] ozzach: whats the conversion rate from rolls to washed cash
[0:53:59] gunblade00: @Ming microwave can dry money.
[0:54:01] HOTDAM: @fornik8r Japanese love their coins. crazy they always pay with exact currency for items
[0:54:04] Pheyerus: It’s gotta be to place in an atm
[0:54:04] i1_Ghost: xqcOmega
[0:54:04] immun99: sell weed to clean it?
[0:54:21] Clabberlang: if it looks like that, def weed sales
[0:54:38] StrawHatGerry: @ming what if the sewer guy is selling the dryer?
[0:54:39] mandypyro: try a run
[0:54:41] madviper162: mhm
[0:54:42] nightmarization: could try
[0:54:45] dome4days: mhm
[0:54:45] bigpune: ming are there ironing boards?
[0:54:46] oynxz: thats what i  think weed  sales
[0:54:47] Clabberlang: one way to find out
[0:54:47] ErraticSwami: turf selling probably
[0:54:48] iliketowatchsmall: @ming time to try
[0:54:49] i1_Ghost: never know
[0:54:51] manfredalfredgernot: definitely need a dryer and and iron to straighten out the cash
[0:54:51] ErraticSwami: unlocked
[0:54:52] reagon_plays: you get rolled cash from weed sales no ?
[0:54:55] spacejambluray: every rolled bill has to be cleaned through weed sales after washing? sounds too far fetched
[0:54:56] ViaNaXTN: I mean, at least try it
[0:54:57] Light1stNight: SCHIZO  strats day
[0:54:58] muskin6: Give it a spin
[0:55:03] Samrat1993: You can give it to fence guy
[0:55:05] rabal_: leaves washing machine in the middle...
[0:55:08] bkr6249: sells one and gets blickied
[0:55:09] Shaun_Thee_Sheep: ming dry them on the beach
[0:55:11] Luthercorpz: Dryer seems needed
[0:55:12] reagon_plays: yea
[0:55:19] reagon_plays: i think it dries itself in the machine maybe after 3-4 hours it appears in the second slot ?
[0:55:21] Shaun_Thee_Sheep: mrbongDerp
[0:55:21] gunblade00: @Ming yea ironimng boards or like blow drers.
[0:55:21] Pheyerus: iron it
[0:55:22] quagiie: there are a lot of other things that seem illogial
[0:55:22] Lenny_Kibbutz: an illegal job giving clean money makes no sense
[0:55:23] Luthercorpz: idk ... really it's all like wtf at this point
[0:55:23] killing4pleasure: he already placed a dryer
[0:55:25] RU8H: maybe you dont get rolled cash from weed sales any more idk
[0:55:25] Light1stNight: i would say leave some placed
[0:55:26] ViaNaXTN: yeah, actually it dont make sense lmao, unless it changed to clean money when you sell
[0:55:27] quagiie: and still were made that way
[0:55:34] ozzach: what was the conversion rate from rolls to washed
[0:55:39] gustavAhhr: Hi Mr. bong
[0:55:40] Denwopp: it says "ready for placement" on them
[0:55:42] frogmario: try it anyway
[0:55:47] Xpatrol: I will guess let them dry on the floor and instead of garbage bag its transform in cash later
[0:55:49] ind_i_go: should just try selling the chopped car parts, seems like such a hassle to run them all now
[0:55:49] xflame404: @ozzach 1 to 1
[0:55:49] gustavAhhr: bouseGreatest
[0:55:51] bkr6249: you can get on 4heads case now about all his shit being worthless
[0:55:51] khadka9860: every illegal jobs are linked thats why
[0:55:51] herpedyderpape: maybe need to press it inbetween something so that it stays in cash shape when its dried
[0:55:53] ComfyAura: @Denwopp NOWAY
[0:55:56] edison2000: Maybe when quality reaches 0 it turns into money momey?
[0:56:00] dinqegod: dinqegod subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months! 
[0:56:02] kaybie4: Have you tried  dying them on the weed rack
[0:56:04] Gurgle_Firewater: the serials get marked stolen, so cash needs to be moved all around is the logic i quess
[0:56:04] smoglet: btw do we know now who this viper character was that lovemore called about yesterday?
[0:56:07] Luthercorpz: Be funny if you need a dryer, a iron and a iron board an have to straighten out each bill one by one in game LUL
[0:56:09] MingsPrio: mrbongLove mrbongCL mrbongLove mrbongCL mrbongLove mrbongCL

[0:56:15] Luthercorpz: Feels iike a 4.0 thing to have to do LUL
[0:56:17] Gay_Moore: maybe washed go to the VU because that is the placement step in money laundering
[0:56:18] gunblade00: mrbongHype mrbongHype mrbongHype mrbongHype mrbongHype mrbongHype mrbongHype mrbongHype mrbongHype mrbongHype mrbongHype mrbongLove mrbongLove mrbongLove mrbongMrMing mrbongW

[0:57:06] Aireys943: yea that makes no sense
[0:57:14] reagon_plays: it could be if weed doesnt gives rolled cash now
[0:57:15] muskin6: Weed could be buffed
[0:57:15] ricepurityscore: Launder at casino LUL
[0:57:18] yuzi_K0: 4head Aware
[0:57:18] somebadtiming: surely that makes no sense
[0:57:19] Xpatrol: doesnt make sense
[0:57:19] a4k1t: BADADAN CHASE n STATUS
[0:57:22] gperspective: how is the money dirty to begin with lol
[0:57:26] 1void1x: about to find out ig
[0:57:30] i1_Ghost: you dont get paid very well from weed, so maybe
[0:57:32] reagon_plays: it could be if weed doesnt gives rolled cash now 󠀀
[0:57:34] bigpune: drying money would the most logical thing
[0:57:39] a4k1t: on hood CUH
[0:57:43] BackWoodBilly111: :tf: devs
[0:57:45] Fapnx: have you tried just putting it in the bank
[0:57:49] carlosarmenta9: washing machine having 2 slots means its probably just time to dry
[0:57:51] somebadtiming: 5Head
[0:57:51] Aireys943: you earn dirty money by doing dirty jobs, no reason for you to do more process just to do that job again
[0:57:52] reagon_plays: wait
[0:57:54] quagiie: maybe you have to mix it in with "clean" money so deposit into a bank or the atm yea
[0:57:56] RU8H: maybe
[0:57:58] Pheyerus: that’s what I said
[0:57:59] andyhlp: have you tried marty's casino LUL
[0:58:01] gunblade00: @Ming maybe the other slots for like loundry detergent so clean faster n if you put the dryer paper thing it drys the money.
[0:58:02] reagon_plays: that might be it
[0:58:04] ozzach: could be it yeah
[0:58:06] Luthercorpz: Yah drying is my guess but how ..lol
[0:58:13] Denwopp: have you tried putting in the atm ?
[0:58:13] RU8H: nope
[0:58:13] smoglet: well if it's crinkled, somehow pressing it is what sounds the most logical
[0:58:14] BackWoodBilly111: classic  Dhead buying weedd
[0:58:22] onix146: 30 PagMan big sale
[0:58:30] smoglet: put it under the matress

[0:58:42] hundred_beast22: Jigglin
[0:58:44] iliketowatchsmall: U finish it? @ming
[0:58:48] muskin6: Atm theory seems logical
[0:58:54] gperspective: gotta dry it after you wash it only makes sense
[0:58:58] ComfyAura: LMFAO i guess you dont
[0:59:02] Luthercorpz: Maybe just put stacks of rolled cash in front of a heater LUL  Thatd be so stupid
[0:59:10] heymuuni: LULW
[0:59:11] RU8H: OMEGALUL
[0:59:13] reagon_plays: its either atm or you need to keep it on floor

[0:59:14] Aireys943: OMEGADANCEBUTFAST
[0:59:14] killing4pleasure: Dez on one
[0:59:18] iliketowatchsmall: ATM thing seems stupid
[0:59:18] theheisenberg64: LUL LUL
[0:59:18] gunblade00: atm be good way to lunder the money then.
[0:59:29] gperspective: there might be a slot you overlooked at the washing machine for drying
[0:59:35] nate42i: It’s up to Ming to find the racing npc
[0:59:45] Pheyerus: @iliketowatchsmall it really doesn’t
[0:59:49] HOTDAM: dez an atm operator?
[0:59:54] reagon_plays: KEKW
[0:59:57] Kavicsftw: how would you get paid tho
[1:00:00] 911_raj: That does not make sense
[1:00:00] ComfyAura: then give it back OMEGADANCEBUTFAST
[1:00:02] Xpatrol: make no sense for me
[1:00:05] ViaNaXTN: yeah fuck it KEKW
[1:00:05] HeyImNas: stranger things have happened KEKW
[1:00:06] reagon_plays: might be one of the way
[1:00:09] bigpune: mrbongT
[1:00:12] zvidrvhim: Can you still deposit normal rolls at VU?
[1:00:12] RedaB96: yea u right
[1:00:14] Denwopp: you couldnt put it in the atm yourself?
[1:00:15] mandypyro: yeah u need a man on the inside makes sense kinda
[1:00:15] manfredalfredgernot: that would be ridiculous and even more tedious. imagine you don't have access to gruppe6
[1:00:16] silverxco_: you never know LUL
[1:00:16] Xpatrol: 100% just a timer for drying this money
[1:00:17] Astrolli: that makes no sense but there is a possibilty
[1:00:17] blickyglizz: what this?
[1:00:23] Luthercorpz: Yah thats no sense how are u getting paid then LUL
[1:00:24] eggnoyolk: overthinking maybe
[1:00:27] jonny282: prob just have to let it dry lol
[1:00:29] jaycedace00: That would be sick
[1:00:31] edison2000: Most probably xdd, devs looooooove g6
[1:00:31] RedaB96: probably some drying relatred thing
[1:00:32] ind_i_go: making you "find out in RP"
[1:00:35] greml1n55: maybe it just needs time
[1:00:36] SPOOK_404: would it take rep away from whoever owns the atm?
[1:00:39] herpedyderpape: i think you need to press it to keep it in shape as it dries
[1:00:43] enar_ixo: It says "ready for placement"
[1:00:43] FasweeQ: least complicated nopixel puzzle
[1:00:44] nate42i: maybe better odds at vanilla unicorn
[1:00:51] muskin6: What if u can open atm with something and put it yourself
[1:00:52] Spikebeepbop: placing it on floor/table makes most sense. they made a special crinkled look for it
[1:00:58] bkr6249: does the VU give you wet money to?
[1:01:00] vewybig: this is not irl you in fantasy movie (no meta)
[1:01:01] nandbread: try the pawnshop
[1:01:02] reagon_plays: atm might have 2 options either put normal money or washed money
[1:01:03] 1void1x: can u buy stuff with it?
[1:01:05] reyvanr: I think it is the next step after drying.
[1:01:14] surtren: I think it just takes time to dry
[1:01:15] Shaun_Thee_Sheep: iBEEFWALK  song request si SR
[1:01:18] jaycedace00: It involves more people which is good rp
[1:01:19] Shaun_Thee_Sheep: is*
[1:01:22] Gay_Moore: it would make sense with the placement tip that it needs a legal job to finish it
[1:01:25] vewybig: nothing should make sense
[1:01:27] gperspective: mr K should know i bet
[1:01:33] Mandan0: Do you have a warrent after what happend with J
[1:01:35] Aireys943: that also will force to have civs in gangs as such, have them clean stuff for the gangs
[1:01:37] Pheyerus: that or ‘place’ on an ironing board to iron it out
[1:01:37] cSandu1: LUL
[1:01:38] blickyglizz: @Shaun_Thee_Sheep u sir are great ty
[1:01:38] Luthercorpz: Even tho its a fantasy world things have to make at least SOME logic real world sense
[1:01:39] ind_i_go: LUL
[1:01:43] BlastedRoyal: LUL

[1:01:57] np_lurker_flash: @ming u think crims can force g6 workers to give up atms?
[1:01:58] reagon_plays: Fiddy this guy
[1:01:59] AajonusVonderplanitz: No time for Ming PoroSad
[1:02:05] gunblade00: well would jus seem that getthing the money from the dudes jus make you have to do one extra step if they jus put the money in the atrms.
[1:02:12] ricepurityscore: I mean they're literally WASHING the money to wash the money
[1:02:15] reagon_plays: ye
[1:02:27] nintynien: i think floor makes the most sense
[1:02:31] prassy: @np_lurker_flash how could you possibly know who has which ATM
[1:02:33] Maniac1994: More stuff to make the house messy
[1:02:36] Aireys943: put some near the heater and let it dry while you are doing other shit
[1:02:37] zenwas0: wasnt there a guy lovemo was trying to tell you abt?
[1:02:39] 1void1x: Just give it time maybe?
[1:02:39] Luthercorpz: Put it on floor with a heater above it is the only guess. LUL
[1:02:40] common_idiot: maybe it's like weed and you can put it on a drying rack with a heater LUL
[1:02:45] ItsEdBoi_: Seems so weird to just time gate the money more
[1:02:47] reagon_plays: if you can more washing machines in exchange you need to put on the floor it is worth it
[1:02:47] MingsPrio: Time to put a nice big table In the house to place them on
[1:02:55] War4ire: The wood guys may have a drying rack BP to craft
[1:02:56] ValuableBoring: Fees
[1:02:57] Clabberlang: tax

[1:03:04] enar_ixo: A cut when they withdraw?
[1:03:05] quagiie: yeah if everyone has to do the atm thingy it seems unlikely
[1:03:05] 4headsgoofyassvan: does the VU gives you washed money 2 ??
[1:03:06] reagon_plays: i think they get percentage cut
[1:03:10] racemachines: maybe withdawal fees

[2:25:27] Athasin: @Hooded_G Nah, if stealing a G6 driver's keycard will be a step in doing heists then you want as many G6 drivers working as possible
[2:25:31] gunblade00: well its nice they made 4.0 lil more civ stuff the last 3 updates was mostly crim stuff.
[2:25:34] ViciousRumor: @mandypyro he just picked it up like 20 minutes ago, parked it in the driveway at the house and it's not there
[2:25:40] epic_smee: @luthercorpz cops cant just open it without RS and they will add a Lot of mechanics. I wouldn't worry
[2:25:41] sentientu: @Ming isnt it weird that g6 can make like 6k off one run but crims cant even come close to that if they steal a full load
[2:25:53] Luthercorpz: Group6 guys are basically gonna be cops once they can buy guns LUL
[2:25:56] Athasin: @Hooded_G And the best way to achieve that is to make it a valid way to make money
[2:25:57] mandypyro: @ViciousRumor the rental i meant
[2:26:07] despicablewebb: elevator Aware
[2:26:09] krazkami: !PC

[2:26:31] ind_i_go: yeah once they do the harder drugs unlocks w/ turf
[2:26:33] 1void1x: u need to someone to decorate your house
[2:26:34] maxlbon: they gotta establish the civs first, it makes sense they dont want everyone to be criminals @Ming
[2:26:39] Luthercorpz: @epic_smee I mean I watch Gomres pov with the boxes most tragic tale I ever saw. 600 hrs of driving for a useless box LUL
[2:26:43] Luthercorpz: It was funny AF tho
[2:26:44] deepnap: I like the fact that most crims are not jumping on civs jobs just for money but building connections with civs
[2:26:48] remmy_6: g6 r getting too much is the problem i think akiwooDespair
[2:27:00] epic_smee: They are Just really careful to establish civs, so they avoid nopixel being just crims vs cops again and civs left behind
[2:27:01] alex_shimada: SEXO
[2:27:12] despicablewebb: facts, late 3.0 was either rob big bank or race. civ jobs felt non existent
[2:27:16] gunblade00: going be like last time can do one hiest mission every so ofthen so one run you make the same amount the drivers can make in the same amount of time.

[2:28:00] epic_smee: @luthercorpz yes but i doubt devs think of someone doing 600hrs of grime by now. Probably thought they have more time before adding mechanics
[2:28:04] alex_shimada: omieSEXO
[2:28:13] ViciousRumor: I'm not criminal mastermind but I feel like grinding out G6 to get your organization set up with the right stuff would be the smart move
[2:28:27] gunblade00: @Khosi7 still trying to figer it out thought one was for lundry soap n the other was for dryer papper.
[2:28:36] Luthercorpz: @epic_smee Yah he was the first also it costs like 4k to make 1 box LUL no many ppl have found out the hard way an got there
