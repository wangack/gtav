[4:04:02] dambabygurl: Mr Romanov feels betrayed, not just because his CEO betrayed him, but his secret lover, JP.

JP saw Mr Romanov as simply a hot piece of ass, while Mr Romanov always had deep feelings for JP. SAJ

[4:10:17] dambabygurl: Mr Romanov feels betrayed, not just because his CEO betrayed him, but his secret lover, JP. After Mr Romanov threatened JP to expose their affair to Ginger because he was tired of hiding in the bushes in fear of being caught by Ginger, JP decided to betray the whole company to cause chaos as to not get caught by Ginger. JP saw Mr Romanov as simply a hot piece of ass, while Mr Romanov always had deep feelings for JP. SAJ

[4:52:38] bdot19: those who were great will be great again
[4:52:40] oopsieadam: if u love chaos and pain then yes JP did make it interesting =
[4:52:40] WebGems: @revokecloudzz he went the GOT s8 route though
[4:52:42] ArcWraiths: isn't this the whole reason no robbing houses was in place lmao i dont get it
[4:52:44] Raisin_Fighter: I mean he hasnt rp'd at all with the move. Just offline raided and ghosted? What is that
[4:52:46] zzdka: @lejack15 maybe if theres rp leading up to it, but it was offline robbery no build up no nothing
[4:52:48] rossy4000: if you can’t get a gun put a bounty on his head!!!
[4:52:49] kroos1889: even tho its just a game they have put alot of hours in to this and it all being taken away by a so called ''friend'' is just hurtful
[4:52:49] moonsstone: ooc how are you feeling?
[4:52:50] bezurck: RP is about to be awkward ooc wise boys
[4:52:52] Codepiled: its so demoralizing. could have at least rp'd it. feels like ooc shade when it shouldn't
[4:52:53] BIumenT0pF: how do you think that drama is not interesting for the viewers ?
[4:52:53] jaysonkat: Kitmond riot
[4:52:54] Wiidiis: @sevangle I used to be a juicer but honestly won’t ever watch him play JP ever again
[4:52:54] luvtori333: x honestly cares only about himself ego
[4:52:55] Kiahmackley: you need the matching fit with  yuno now 😂😂
[4:52:55] twinspike: Ray, I genuinly feel for you guys <3
[4:52:56] xtrymas1: @cloud1o27 nah, x took all the rigs and gpus too omegalol
[4:52:59] IRISHT0NKA: Ray is the most dangerous in the city  but now he is in control but for now. And it should be so tuff to control people should take exemples of legends like you
[4:53:00] ShreddyEddie519: Jean Paul doesn’t care and isn’t thinking twice about this… neither should you! don’t let this break Ray!
[4:53:01] zulu189: Well X mostly cares about himself in and out of character, not trying to be a dick that's just how it is
[4:53:01] izpurp_girl123: Relax first thing
[4:53:01] cloud1o27: 'so much shit stolen' like what...and jp entitled to good portion too. jp shoulda cleared them out and then theyd know how bad it would be
[4:53:02] iiKuwal: jp is just a character that does literally the most chaotic option possible, he’s not on anyone’s side but his own
[4:53:04] d4rkkrut4: If you properly think it made no sense from JP because I think the relationship with ray was way better than marty but as you can see he still dont give a damn. fail rp from viewer standpoint the event made no sense to happen
[4:53:04] G1ZONE: @hardblood__ not a lot of people understand that! Everybody would be now looking for someone who buy PC which really got boring
[4:53:06] CheyanneStorm: legit my jaw dropped when i saw what had happened
[4:53:08] fcd1703: @MissAura_ Thats his character so... he doesnt use ooc feelings to influence his character.
[4:53:11] apepi: Yuno is a good friend.
[4:53:14] c0mptyi: @zulu189 True, but nobody will agree this is facts
[4:53:15] CygnusX406: its messed up man no matter how in game it is
[4:53:15] cloud1o27: > 2 days to recover
[4:53:16] razyberries: so subs in here crying about how was RP ruined but also “it’s RP” make it make sense lmaoo
[4:53:17] RetroGoki: theres so many other routes to an interesting to story that could of been taken and X took the ez way out
[4:53:17] MarusterS: I hate the take of some chatters saying "X gave rp." You don't create RP when it's an offline raid LUL
[4:53:18] izpurp_girl123: Yes
[4:53:18] josshhy17: Really love ur streams man , glad ur ooc ok
[4:53:21] isaias_lion: Was that kit? Or her sister?
[4:53:22] moonsstone: yeah it would be frustrating
[4:53:24] bender108: Like i kinda get why he did it offline the meta would be crazy he is right about that and this can make a great story if you can preserve the storyline going i know it sucks for you because he kinda slowed down your streaming @Ray__C
[4:53:24] Bigfoot0009: Hope the rain in Cali hasn't cause you any issues
[4:53:24] melodya03: Yeah
[4:53:25] jean_valjean: @kroos1889 It’s not only “just a game” it’s RP. They are playing characters
[4:53:26] MissAura_: Exactly like a coward
[4:53:26] zguy77: kinda saw it coming weeks ago lol
[4:53:27] LuxusT_: i mean its a scummy move
[4:53:28] Vinn_: @cloud1o27 you must be new
[4:53:29] PolariZeBluz: thats so wack he couldve left and not take anything, hour of grind gone smh
[4:53:30] Codiak416: It was a dogshit way to do it. it was not RP'd well.
[4:53:30] Stevie123123: how many days till you recover do you think??
[4:53:31] CheyanneStorm: it's like a powergaming move
[4:53:33] Lurdzz: DEBBY DOWNER RP omE
[4:53:34] fouzman: atleast you didnt get foundation wiped offline LUL
[4:53:36] iiKuwal: apparently he heard footsteps in the house when he did it @ray__c
[4:53:36] zerk159: Let your emotions flow like a gust of wind
[4:53:37] georgieporge23: that was a snaky move on his part
[4:53:38] zVansum: @MarusterS after the fact obv
[4:53:39] kroos1889: @jean_valjean its still hundreds of hours wasted
[4:53:44] MahiMahiFillet: owner rp
[4:53:45] G1ZONE: @bender108 Exactly
[4:53:45] Gaz_H20: but robbery’s were banned
[4:53:46] ShreddyEddie519: Jean Paul doesn’t care and isn’t thinking twice about this… neither should you! don’t let this break Ray!
[4:53:48] FunnyValentine1847: if he pulled it online with rp around it I can respect it, but offline raid is such bullshit
[4:53:48] georgieporge23: he should have done it when at least one person was awake
[4:53:49] rossy4000: yeah if he did it live sun others were online it would’ve been fun rp this way nothing can come from it
[4:53:50] jdonz1: I hope you get your revenge @Ray__C
[4:53:50] PieCats: its lame
[4:53:51] lordgarty: I think x is a very selfish person so fuck him ray your the rust crew you whipped them into a creative be feared on the server come on my son grind and shoot grind and shoot 🔫 😤 💪 💯
[4:53:51] Nijumaa: @zulu189 whyd he leave stuff for them then?
[4:53:53] postnola420: I could see leaving, but do it through rp
[4:53:53] Wiidiis: @cloud1o27 moron, JO contributed less than 10% to all that stuff, he literally stole 80-90% of everything
[4:53:54] s2tha3l: Has Ray told Yuno already?
[4:53:55] helixpyre84: I mean the usb is probably one of the worst parts since you cant get them anymore
[4:53:55] cloud1o27: he left 200 btc.....they recover in 2 days
[4:53:59] Bemer9: What he did was fine and the large amount gives it more meaning, BUT he has to be fair and let you get stuff back through RP, If he just NVL's and refuses to give stuff back at gun point it's just cringe
[4:54:02] zzdka: @cloud1o27 he lost the company more money than he ever earned
[4:54:03] tyrannuswrecked: @ray__c don’t feel bad about feeling bad. you lost a lot of work, but it’s also an opportunity to rebuild the company stronger
[4:54:04] MarusterS: @zVansum it's miserable for ppl involved
[4:54:05] razyberries: @codiak416 because if it was “RP’d well” then you would have meta’d to your streamer for it to prevented lol
[4:54:06] Koltary: @cloud1o27 braindead take, he was entitled to literally only 10% of it, he never sold he never made money, cost them 60k in fines that RAY paid off, actual brain dead take, it was a low move from JP and it could've been even lower but he left the rest cause he thought he heard someone
[4:54:07] jdonz1: BECOME THE VILLIAN BABY
[4:54:11] kroos1889: @cloud1o27 because he couldnt take it lmao
[4:54:12] beeeeeenice: Keep your head up @Ray__C peppoLove peppoLob
[4:54:12] BoxFan112: I honestly do feel if it was anyone else or done to anyone else, this would be retconned lol
[4:54:12] jean_valjean: @kroos1889 Not wasted. still chance for more RP from this. That’s the whole point, not the progress or butt coin
[4:54:12] jaysonkat: Kitmond praydge pls
[4:54:18] k_xrl: He stole the vpn so they cant mine btc
[4:54:21] zVansum: @cloud1o27 he took what they need to mine butc KEKW
[4:54:23] moondropsoup: LOL
[4:54:27] helixpyre84: @cloud1o27 you cant buy the usb anymore
[4:54:27] cloud1o27: he left 200 in there tho...
[4:54:28] izpurp_girl123: Villain ark
[4:54:28] Codiak416: @razyberries I aint one of those, try again.
[4:54:28] KushKowboy6: it was 3 days of grinding guys. we’ve had 37 full days of RP. it wasn’t “getting boring” you were just hungry for something bad to happen
[4:54:33] hard_2_explain: Oh Eli! KEKW
[4:54:35] ed_qc: Please ditch the 3rd wheel...
[4:54:35] bender108: @bender108 Yeah but it is what it is and it can make for a great storyline for us to enjoy
[4:54:35] sevangle: @Wiidiis Honestly same. He went too far this time FeelsRainMan
[4:54:39] Ltdan1902: !yuno
[4:54:39] razyberries: @codiak416 sure…
[4:54:39] RaycBot: Yuno is played by https://www.youtube.com/user/Sykkuno
[4:54:42] moondropsoup: I would love a villain ark
[4:54:43] hardblood__: @hardblood__ yea cuhhhhhh
[4:54:44] kroos1889: @jean_valjean ofcourse its wasted... wym
[4:54:46] lordgarty: Jp is a rat no doubt
[4:54:51] jdonz1: Take out Ginger
[4:54:53] cloud1o27: if he took the 100k in house decorations, id get it
[4:54:54] Lurdzz: he left enough for them to recover really quickly they have enough ButC for all the racks and glue
[4:54:54] wildarrow88: Dragon is a hitter
[4:54:57] MilkMeSenpai: I see this kinda RP the same as the Lumber jacks getting robbed, I don't think its interesting
[4:54:58] Lurdzz: gpus*
[4:54:59] Sqeedys: @Wiidiis it is not that deep omE
[4:55:00] icy_doop: chats gotta chill and remember they're roleplaying characters
[4:55:07] buttersfrfr: no Rp is ruined this created new Rp by definition these are new scenes created and it wouldn't be created without the incident.
[4:55:07] zVansum: let the interns hunt him down
[4:55:12] netzky_: the chemistry between ray and jp was great too.. rip
[4:55:12] zzdka: @cloud1o27 he stole way more than 100k wym omE
[4:55:16] s2tha3l: @jdonz1 yo this would be a good arc to kidnap her and hold her for ransom
[4:55:17] pokimk: kidnap ginger ask jp bring your thing back
[4:55:17] Shark_Whole: @moondropsoup  villain arc is bad tbh. People will only dogpile  on you.
[4:55:21] tuifirefist: Time to hunt down Rat Paul
[4:55:21] fbi_case: yall gotta remember X IS ROLEPLAYING he isn’t like this
[4:55:23] jdonz1: @s2tha3l FACTS
[4:55:24] cloud1o27: hahhahaha
[4:55:33] deenawinn: need to rp to retain the interns if they want to join x or maybe x isnt recruiting
[4:55:33] EmryG: @zVansum naive view, of course rp can be ruined
[4:55:34] adam_ainl: u don't need all that Butcoin anyway @Ray__C
[4:55:35] FunnyValentine1847: GIGACHAD starts grinding sanitation
[4:55:35] NFLisRIGGED: @fbi_case Clueless
[4:55:36] SereneDreams: I have a hard time with the "lul it was boring" take, because like.. I enjoyed the content that came from it, the character growth and seeing JP and the others finally hard pursuing W's instead of getting L's which was a great change of pace from a good chunk of the 3.0 stuff.
[4:55:37] georgieporge23: @icy_doop  thing is Jean didn’t role play this he did it offline while everyone was offline that not RP
[4:55:39] xtrymas1: @Shark_Whole its x tho, he always get dogpiled
[4:55:40] Nultez: @cloud1o27 he took 400k in buttc it self
[4:55:40] chakaw667: @fbi_case Clueless
[4:55:42] razyberries: @codiak416 the point is even if you are one of those or aren’t, if you had a brain you’d understand that people will meta it. so what’s your problem? your just mar your streamer lost progress
[4:55:42] jean_valjean: @kroos1889 Not wasted. The time and progress makes the betrayal that much worse, making this decision for how they respond that much juicier. ITS RP NOT JUST PLAYING A VIDEO GAME
[4:55:42] zerk159: Rat Paul is eating his cheese
[4:55:43] zzdka: @fbi_case he watched the ooc clips and said "i don't care" while laughing, idk about that
[4:55:45] EmryG: @zVansum wrong response sry
[4:55:48] itsrhythm1: @cloud1o27 upwards of 600k
[4:55:49] Jinxjarr: @pokimk that would be crazy lol but i dont think he would care
[4:55:54] lilbootyvertt: !dora

[4:56:29] MrFullM3talX: i lost all respect for jp even tho i dont want to. just kinda weird man.
[4:56:31] Koltary: @Ray__C would ray now be more invested in making more money or upgrading BUTC
[4:56:33] FunnyValentine1847: Dragon GIGACHAD
[4:56:33] fbi_case: He was laughing at the reactions
[4:56:36] s2tha3l: @zzdka xqc definitely has his own world and his juicers are just living in it
[4:56:38] melodya03: Loyal friends Gladge
[4:56:43] icy_doop: @georgieporge23 its up to you to understand what ROLEPLAY is my friend
[4:56:45] josaghi: @cloud1o27 brother, why are u jus spamming what jp's talking points here
[4:56:47] 90super__: @MrFullM3talX its ok we dont claim you xqcL
[4:56:49] DarkZizou: Sorry for my juicer
[4:56:51] SereneDreams: @cloud1o27 They also only have little GPUs except one rack which was probably a mistake on his part, like.. Their butc is not that high now.
[4:56:58] BoxFan112: @90super__ to be fair, anytime stuff like this happens, every rp chat gets too invested lol
[4:57:02] elcasador3: @MrFullM3talX thanks for telling us, dont are
[4:57:04] razyberries: I find it hilariously how the same chatters in different scenarios will say “chat its RP” & then when something to this scale happens you cry for your streamers lost progress, make it make sense
[4:57:04] XenonL4: @FunnyValentine1847 he said he did it so people didnt meta and login and you gotta admit they 100% would of
[4:57:06] thech00zen1: Hang out with ELI to rebuild. One person that is chill
[4:57:17] cloud1o27: u know they can spend 100 btc to get all the bp's for everything
[4:57:17] Sh4rkill3r: -99 turbo for kit o7
[4:57:19] donsol88: @mrfullm3talx and his OOC reasoning was off as well. He said he did it because he wanted respect
[4:57:24] jean_valjean: @razyberries TRUE
[4:57:27] shawnlaw591: Didnt he give JEAN PAUL the turbo?????
[4:57:28] zzdka: @FunnyValentine1847 and doing the heist when everyone else if offline is also meta, double standards there
[4:57:29] lejack15: Raymonds got people who care! FeelsStrongMan People worth investing time into and building back from
[4:57:35] melodya03: @zzdka Cold hard truth Aware
[4:57:35] cloud1o27: and still have 100 btc left...yall trippin if u dont think the co can make it back in 2 days
[4:57:38] ROXYismydogsname: @razyberries I know its shameless bro

[4:57:41] tsarjaguar: If this happened to x the chat will be horrendous
[4:57:42] FunnyValentine1847: @FunnyValentine1847 you are telling me Benji, Ray and OTT will meta?
[4:57:48] elcasador3: @FunnyValentine1847 theres only rp while streaming?
[4:57:48] SereneDreams: @razyberries I'm sorry but this was a real human time investment, like you can't not be sad at that shit, huge HUGE real days worth of investment.
[4:57:49] XenonL4: @natitime true
[4:57:53] zh3evus: @razyberries this looks like rp to you?

[5:24:42] jesterconfit: @Koltary Not entirely. Since fighting cypress will burn more bridges than what they've already burned + it will be harder for them since they'll just give JP more allies (enemy of your enemy is your friend). Since they also need to rebuild, weed selling is a good way to earn money so no, Cypress is their smallest issue.

[6:50:30] RAAZR: JP alone now so he actually has to grind himself KEKW
[6:50:31] cryptonious: Should do it just to waste his time honestly
[6:50:32] Seetherrr: transaction record on the HD, yeah?
[6:50:33] axevl: @axevl nah but in the real world using crypto to buy shit cant be traced so how do they prove who bought what
[6:50:34] p__dragon: ramee defending you?
[6:50:35] hapigilmore: Every job he did he put it in and you provided clout. Bengi ran off dex and the hippi girl and killed zaza and the optics of the war.

[6:50:43] youngdec: Mickey vs Ramee in court over the stuff would be hilarious
[6:50:45] xxnovaxx73: lmfao fr
[6:50:45] G1ZONE: Yes !
[6:50:45] Setsuko143: 200 butcoin = 400k

[6:50:55] theegargamel1: Sorry, this is happening to you, Ray.
[6:50:55] hopevs2: it was 310 but @Setsuko143
[6:50:56] reach27: 200 butc is still pretty nice
[6:50:58] SerYessir: not much difference
[6:50:58] Originnal: it is a big difference yall can recover
[6:50:59] zandrusz: That kinda opens up them to being investigated as well. X can say illegal stuff taken was theirs LUL
[6:50:59] IRISHT0NKA: no gun
[6:50:59] ZachCR3: this could have been a lot worse though
[6:51:00] jnsyvp: yea jp was being too selfish for what he did

[6:51:10] thecrazyads: he said he didnt have the room and time
[6:51:10] auraphim: I mean he could've took all the butcoin
[6:51:12] kaemezeta: but taking more but could have been easy right? @Ray__C
[6:51:12] bkr6249: prob no room or other people were waking up

[6:51:27] advancedwolverine: if you sue you might lose street cred no?
[6:51:27] Setsuko143: he took like 800k NETWORTH WTF
[6:51:28] ThePawPaw: plus why he did NOT took all the BUTC and left 170 thats alot to leave behind

[7:01:25] red_snapper: I believe in the company yall gonna be just fine
[7:01:25] bolbi77: he has been planning it for weeks, you were just blind
[7:01:25] neptuneeh: I ruin peoples days with extract ratting while gettin head
[7:01:25] mysticpo0l: The simple answer is this was his plan from the start and everyone except Marty ignored it
[7:01:25] mxntxalzxen: What car did you get?

[7:01:30] IlBreeze: nah jp is either deranged, impulsive or isnt used to having relationships like this as a leader
[7:01:30] fntasmabby: ray's already grinding it back, you'll fs be back soon, trust
[7:01:31] TheGladiator2212: anyway, we move GIGACHAD
[7:01:32] BlackSheep086: probably got clapped in tarkov one too many times and needed a "W" LUL
[7:01:32] stopbaton: @volgarmushroom j bc u don’t like it doesn’t mean it’s not good it makes perfect sense for the character
[7:01:33] saucewok: @iamthesupport420 thanks bro
[7:01:34] andress_sanchez: You should have listened to Marty and Yuno 🤷🏼‍♂️🤷🏼‍♂️🤷🏼‍♂️
[7:01:34] shankywick: it was the plan all along, marty warned you

[7:01:45] cryptonious: Jps RP is fucking dog water
[7:01:47] ionepunchedgoku: he wanted to send you back to the stone ages because you gave him too much
[7:01:47] SkippingSword18: ooc the reason was he couldnt leave the company, he tried to step down but everyone kept putting him up, he saw this as you guys had to lose this to understand not to take this sort of shit, atleast thats my guess
[7:01:47] missgxxx: <3
[7:01:47] luhconky: @1v9johnwick check dms

[7:01:54] tyrannuswrecked: @ray__c it’s the offline part that feels personal. doing it IC to your face is different
[7:01:55] asyruffz: You need distraction for your mind, go hunting or something.

[8:16:12] Ninja_v1: maybe it wasnt sudden in jp's mind
[8:16:13] donsol88: @originnal lol snitching is exposing criminal activity to cops. nothing more to it than that
[8:16:14] PeidoAsmatico: He offline raided
[8:16:16] kaemezeta: @Ray__C OOC his chat was getting weird with the ginger interactions so he cut all off
[8:16:18] VictoriaKFC: just trash, really
[8:16:19] ragnar0659: that’s not your call on his rp
[8:16:20] BLaZe_v_OPtixZz: Got a new car, chilling, everyone being together for the first time in a while, jp showing off his car etc
[8:16:20] hornycoral: there is literally no rp to be had bc he did it offline
[8:16:20] ErnestoEloZ: he saw an opportunity awake alone and went for it without regard for RP
[8:16:21] thetokinman: 100% agree. As a juicer i like that you guys are reacting like this. its what anyone would do in character
[8:16:21] Superchampz: get your shit back
[8:16:25] sumdookiehands: @BlazingVollk Online doesn't mean that he has to be streaming, he could have waited for them to be on at least

[8:16:26] eclipsevendetta: 1:02:23 Dr. K Aware Pointless
[8:16:26] anotherDCBot: @trungthiendo It makes sense to do offline, hoppers on all sides make it really bad
[8:16:27] nahummmmmmm: xqcS xqcSword GET HIM
[8:16:28] Jurban5: I agree, idk why he would have done this besides oc clout/viewers
[8:16:33] TheDefaultCamo: i feel like it stemmed from him stepping down as CEO and everyone kinda forcing him back into it
[8:16:33] xbabycheetosx: while i agree doing it offline was cringe, isn't it more spicy doing it whil everything was good? that gives you guys rooms to do stuff like work with the cops and shit yanno
[8:16:34] bishopduma: its so weird.... he killed progression cause he thought there was no progression ICANT
[8:16:34] Kura_JAY: Well, it is what it is. Throw all butc and pc info out in the public and give every one a fair shot to do crime.
[8:16:36] BilbosJourney: how long will you hunt him lol
[8:16:37] dootadoo: You can keep killing him until he is broke
[8:16:38] wilzam100: does going after him help?
[8:16:38] Luthxx: offline raid should be illegal this server dude
[8:16:38] JaiLotus: @blazingvollk wouldn’t matter, everyone was asleep, no RP to ruin
[8:16:42] kilugradi: @valkyriefxx he literally did it out of boredom
[8:16:43] hashtag_nikhil: He got content for his stream, that's all. Because can't solve the puzzle
[8:16:47] wally1899: i dont think its related to that
[8:16:48] Rog1veN: @jockstarraidz im sorry but you're kinda delusional, if someone rip off 80% of my things, i would go insane and go to every single avenue to fuck that person over
[8:16:49] brad4: i bet everyone gets over it in two days like nothing happened
[8:16:51] WHammer0209: no the ginger thing was totally different
[8:16:51] Ninja_v1: oop
[8:16:54] G1ZONE: This is better RP more intense! If he tells y'all in front, y'all will not do anything, and he'll not take the stuff he takes
[8:16:54] Shadowhaox: HUH
[8:16:55] AngryTank_Killa: monkaW
[8:16:55] t0roki: omg weed
[8:16:56] Joerlema: I think that makes the betrayal more organic cause he did it when he was on top
[8:16:59] Superchampz: @jockstarraidz yep
[8:17:01] LandTurtl3: i highly doubt that was why
[8:17:01] VictoriaKFC: fuuuuuuck

[9:14:08] xainho: @KushKowboy6 ok hear me out, racks exist, sure, u need butc, is crypto illegal? nope, to get the rack u need the bp that u buy with butc, but also u need to crack and steal a wifi connection, hacking it to be able to transfer butc and buy the stuff via drone, which is illegal. So they could get everything seized and both get fuckd, but ray more bc he will lose everything that even he has rn

[9:16:05] KushKowboy6: @xainho I actually don’t get your point exactly. they never said anything about butcoin to the police just that they basically lost a server farm worth of graphics cards and computers because the company is a tech company.
[9:16:09] Kolchek_: was doing g6 for like an hour and then when Ray turns up and waits, hes no where to be seen.. butr nahh not meta

[9:23:21] EditorDeb: @JaiLotus i didnt clip it, i think it was at the end of stream
[9:23:24] istoking: money and items are tools for roleplay. Losing some makes for content, good or bad
[9:23:24] AngryTank_Killa: GN Chat, Great RP despite the circumstances xqcL
[9:23:26] Blivinity: How often does ray use police in retaliation to street shit

[9:23:45] badab1ngbadabong: @KaL_id It just isn't like that but alright
[9:23:47] youngdoodleshawty: @youngdoodleshawty not my point. they all signed nda having to do with the topics of discussing computer part and computers
[9:23:48] BiggShruggz: x didn't rp at all
[9:23:50] t0roki: @Blivinity Not that often!
[9:23:51] Zutur: at the end its just rp and content, so just enjoy the ride chat
[9:23:54] Masked_R0nin: What was Raymond's original script Ray_C?
[9:23:55] kuckl0rd_: @Blivinity just as much as the union did
[9:23:55] StreamElements: Ray has an active Insta that you can use to stay up to date with him! raycHypeInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/raycgaming/
[9:23:56] tsarjaguar: Rays mortal enemy now
[9:23:58] izzycaliera: Horrible RP doing it offline because his chat would alter his decisions… both takes make him look trash
[9:23:58] far_eviler: XRAY has been pretty tight
[9:23:59] gateloz: going from planting a gun on Harry to JP isn't that much of a stretch after what was done
[9:24:03] youngdoodleshawty: @youngdoodleshawty they did
[9:24:05] xolision: how is it not more to 50%, both groups famring around 20butc, how do you prove he doesnt own some of it @Ray__C

[9:24:52] NormalTree14319: Jean Paul is xqc OOC lol he doesn’t exactly “RP”
[9:24:52] mo___6: damn
[9:24:54] ak54dus: JP in partnership with others for sure
[9:24:59] packedjellybean: Even tho I think this was poor from xqc in an OOC way, I get that his frustrations with chat led him to make his decisions offline
[9:25:03] iXV3NOMS: EZ
[9:25:03] sara__bee: lysPog lysPog lysPog lysPog lysPog
[9:25:10] reykxo: W Benji
[9:25:15] izzycaliera: The fact he moaned about Yuno's computer desk for days... And he does this.  Marty called it.
[9:25:21] packedjellybean: @izzycaliera so true
[9:25:23] badab1ngbadabong: @NormalTree14319 Not everyone wants to assume a persona though, JP is just a madman, its enough for RP standards
[9:25:24] SUNsh9n: @forsenofficiai bro you are named Forsen, you don't get to say that raycKEKW
[9:25:32] youngdoodleshawty: so did raymond break the nda by snitching about pcs?? @Ray__C
[9:25:33] dhruvpal10: @packedjellybean f you talking man
[9:25:34] Lunaira1: COOs Right Here🤑🫡🫡!!
[9:25:44] crossrider_bankai_24: I like what is happening, but the metagaming are ruining the fun, chatters keep spamming what's happening, in others chat, RP is fun but not with chat and other people involved 😔
[9:25:44] TianSolo: W Benji BibleThump
[9:25:46] KunDares: you got to change the lock guys
[9:25:46] JaiLotus: patar would be a great executive imo

[9:26:09] david199915: Stop adding people in company
[9:26:11] reykxo: facts
[9:26:14] paradox_1003: That's the only thing i think thats bad, other stuff they can get back in 1 week
[9:26:17] Masked_R0nin: @fireyabby It's mainly stealing keys off people. This wouldn't count.
[9:26:18] thestreetsarewatchin: @riftingflotsam so far you can’t anymore
[9:26:21] melodya03: True even without JP
[9:26:25] ForsenOfficiaI: @SUNsh9n Are you one of those so called hate-watchers, or what's up
[9:26:27] tyrannuswrecked: @fireyabby X was a member when he took the stuff. it’s debatable about him leaving, but he had a claim to at least part of it
[9:26:27] JaiLotus: patar
[9:26:29] bubsehh: @RiftingFlotsam i think its gone from app they said
[9:26:33] rroseys: bad idea
[9:26:38] ak54dus: don’t add K anyone else
[9:26:38] MortyBe: new blood
[9:26:39] reykxo: Siz is amazing
[9:26:39] Ninja_v1: watching beric's POV, the cops are getting so much rp from all this too
[9:26:40] RiftingFlotsam: @thestreetsarewatchin That's why next tsunami we need to check right away
[9:26:43] BoxFan112: @fireyabby inside job isn't Bannable, can't steal keys and use them to rob someone else's house
[9:26:45] reykxo: Siz can get shit done
[9:26:46] RAAZR: Breckers is my CEO
[9:26:47] hellokitkit: habibi <3
[9:26:48] Z3KL: he pushes siz so hard
[9:26:50] xDarkBoltx: @fireyabby its different context, the ban was on house raiding
[9:26:50] thestreetsarewatchin: @riftingflotsam true
[9:26:54] jawins777: Patar would be good
[9:26:55] karinkishi99: cant you trust them?
[9:27:01] robertdoso: Wouldn't it cause more conflicts with more executives

[9:28:09] Yossi2x: im so lost
[9:28:12] bmfreal504: He said y’all were too “Mickeyfied”
[9:28:16] robertdoso: Maybe more managers? People that can command under the board
[9:28:20] Stevie123123: ray gotta step up
[9:28:21] BoxFan112: @notalbob can't think that way, it will need to grow, growing means more people
[9:28:25] StreamElements: Ray has an active Twitter that you can use to stay up to date with him! raycHypeTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheRay_C
[9:28:26] badab1ngbadabong: @NormalTree14319 Yeah, he likes chaos, its obvious, a lot of people don't assume random personalities, they just roleplay as 'people in the city'
[9:28:29] christian_pr24: lysL lysL lysL

[9:29:27] NotAlBob: @BoxFan112 they were to soft during the war the only one doing something was JP that is what led to this
[9:29:30] TianSolo: @JerryOH took around 80% of assets offline. PC BUTCoins, BPs
[9:29:41] JerryOH: @JerryOH oh no i meant in 2.0
[9:29:44] troypl1275: Hows it meta lol what I said was SO vague that could mean anything
[9:29:45] izzycaliera: Reverse the roles and we would have a 4 hour+ malding intro.
[9:29:45] donsol88: most of the city will take X side because most ppl know his true nature and to not trust him
[9:29:47] mysticpo0l: @ryotass that's not what happened lol don't spread false info
[9:29:59] Luthxx: @BoxFan112 that is not true OMEGALUL
[9:30:05] triplew98: @troypl1275 u know what ur doiing ur actually a loser
[9:30:11] Lord_Machiavellian: Yeah, essentially. He was a snake and decided to show his fangs yesterday night.   It was nothing OTT, Raymond, Benji, or Mickey 'did'
[9:30:18] troypl1275: Haha funny
[9:30:22] tyrannuswrecked: @triplew98 mod check?
[9:30:22] BoxFan112: @notalbob lol no, jp was the only one with a gun and let no one use it, also he was the soft one, he kept second guessing doing anything lol

[9:30:25] kaemezeta: @Yossi2x https://clips.twitch.tv/DeafBreakableSkirretTebowing-xinIQgb5ynGLo3mx in that clip X explains a little bit too
[9:30:26] akhasban21: Just make a grup with new streamer or the people x call it random guys, they must be loyal
[9:30:26] 0x800CCC0F: catJAM catJAM catJAM catJAM
[9:30:30] HeavyMetalKittenx: @boxfan112 hey box! raycWave raycWave
[9:30:31] CadonaTac: @donsol88 let's be honest, they will take his side because he's X. If any other person does this, they'd be black-listed from everything
[9:30:33] badab1ngbadabong: @izzycaliera now we have someone with cam off and another crying irl
[9:30:34] zettavion: Yeah I agree once micky wanted to bend the knee to Lang I think that's when x was over it
[9:30:39] iXV3NOMS: vibee
[9:30:41] witness2nv: How can any group trust X now
[9:30:45] crossrider_bankai_24: JP reminds me of that drama on Rust when his team was making a lot of progress, X was just gambling scraps, someone took his scraps and he started to throw grenades and explode the base omE
[9:30:52] ashlllyyyy: chat don't be toxic to each other
[9:30:55] ashlllyyyy: nodd

[9:31:30] sara__bee: lysDance lysDance lysDance lysDance
[9:31:32] NotAlBob: @BoxFan112 bro they had weapons and chose not to use them unless they had their hand held
[9:31:33] BoxFan112: @luthxx he did it don't get me wrong, but he literally didn't want to shoot the first time lol
[9:31:33] ashlllyyyy: mods? modCheck
[9:31:34] Lord_Machiavellian: Mickey didn't bend his knee to Lang? He put Lang in his place. Weird take. (Did you even watch the Convo?)
[9:31:34] badab1ngbadabong: @zettavion Nah X wanted to stop the war too, he just didn't want to be the one to take the blame (since it was langs fault in the end but x can't say too much since there was a lot of meta shit around)
[9:31:37] 0x800CCC0F: @witness2nv oh come on, him being unpredictable and doing literally everything to achieve his goals was always well known
[9:31:39] donsol88: @cadonatac ppl in the city will mock the company because trusting X is like standing next to a hungry crocodile and being surprised when it bites ur hand off
[9:31:40] danny_jr9_: x explanation sounds like an excuse, no actual role play behind it
[9:31:43] dan0py: @africanman321 not because he is an owner, let’s be honest he has made a name for himself people want to join on some adventures w him
[9:31:53] Ne0Raven: @witness2nv only thing I can think of is ooc reasons, no way any criminal group would trust a guy that scammed his group/friends
[9:31:56] bmfreal504: @zettavion yup it’s building up from there

[9:57:04] uhwoahdexter: nah don’t really think so. it was scripted fine
[9:57:05] jockstarraidz: using the police to get revenge is equally as bad if not worse so i guess you win right ?
[9:57:07] saucewok: is there any streamers you would like to see come to the server?
[9:57:07] Mthrim: @dreadpirate42 this tbh

[9:57:25] BoxFan112: @prontle you're an ignorant sub too it seems... Lol
[9:57:26] ruby_shot: what sucks is that as a x viewer i liked the company a lot and the other characters but now its like its split so its hard to watch both sides
[9:57:28] bilbel_style: tRUE
[9:57:28] qHaydos: thats ur pov not x's
[9:57:29] Shubank: did raymond also tell Kit abt Murphy braun incident @Ray__C
[9:57:30] its_emannnn: i mean marty warned the company about jp too
[9:57:31] k_xrl: uh oh im being weird and being called boohoo
[9:57:33] XenonL4: he told marty he was going to leave at the peek
[9:57:34] wantednade: didn’t Marty tell you guys tho? Marty had legit proof and y’all brushed it off
[9:57:34] henryhill: @Ray__C he got bitched by OTT live on stream idk if you were there

[9:57:34] auuunt: It was majorly forced RP
[9:57:35] RAVENRIK: JP only progress in 4.0 is on the back of others LUL
[9:57:36] arteezydoppelganger: True especially after he saw you and the crew grind like crazy Sadge
[9:57:37] irishmaniacc: yeah i agree but i think there is going to be crazy RP out of it
[9:57:38] iPLaY2WinDaGame_: maybe there was but you just didnt see it?
[9:57:39] jelaniiiiii: wait who is x
[9:57:40] Luke_So_Good: Ray it can still work out in your characters favour the story is never over mate @Ray__C
[9:57:42] leafs_leafleaf: jp is actually insane yeah what he did was crazy thats him
[9:57:43] robdiggity_: X just blames "meta" and "chat hoppers" but the same effect could have been made if he yoinked 20% not all that he did
[9:57:43] kilugradi: yeah it was forced
[9:57:43] CadonaTac: @kaemezeta Lang's crew already said that anyone who'd invite X into their crew after this would just be a schmuck
[9:57:44] ItsMooseTV: did you see the clip of what he had to say about it?
[9:57:45] lively021: Jp said the company was too soft I don't understand what it mean
[9:57:46] sanesttwitchviewer: xqc cannot RP at all. you shouldnt be surprised bro is restarted and treats this server like GTA single player
[9:57:47] BurpYeah: just outside looking at it
[9:57:48] spliffmeister710: bro made an issue because he was bored
[9:57:49] brufflesx: Campfire chat war
[9:57:50] zakataha1: im a juicer but i dont clain this. make no sens in rp and in ooc.
[9:57:51] phobicshrub: he got bored ooc and couldn't even find some reasonably good rp to justify it
[9:57:51] MarcoOG: didnt yall just argue about the kj thing @Ray__C
[9:57:52] aro_1995: @Masked_R0nin market value? waayy more
[9:57:52] autumnskyz: that’s when the blindside hits the hardest, makes it more juicy
[9:57:54] Heyyouitsmcmuffin: I’m on yalls side but x didn’t seem to want ceo again
[9:57:54] gateloz: he got bored
[9:57:55] ykreal: aint that the whole point of the plan, that he would pull it off when least expected?
[9:57:55] Budbleu: no progess in the heist probably
[9:57:56] skuzzybebe: x rp's a shitty person its absolutely in character LUL
[9:57:56] lexthe420princess: im sorry u had to come on today
[9:57:56] BigHomieLeek: nothing besides greed
[9:57:57] henryhill: @Ray__C OTT bitched him live yesterday and you werent there
[9:57:57] DarkSaddam: he was bored, thats obvious
[9:57:57] IlBreeze: jp is deranged im not gonna front
[9:57:59] fuentes_dgaf: @jelaniiiiii jp
[9:58:00] zaiaadam: But remember his character from 3.0 and stuff
[9:58:01] jockstarraidz: you wasted money on a dogshit car maybe
[9:58:02] mangojuisse: he was waiting until the first heist and then leave but that is taking forever
[9:58:03] lively021: Why did he say the company was soft
[9:58:03] commonshark: @Prontle wicked my point proven take your anger out on yourself, nobody here got you banned that was your own fault bud
[9:58:04] Slightm: hi
[9:58:05] zulu189: that's just how X is, he always has to create chaos and has a hard time with stability
[9:58:05] nevod002: he doesnt care, he wants to join Lang
[9:58:05] c0omerski: jp had issues but didnt communicate it much
[9:58:07] IntentTaxpayer: honestly X needs a counterbalance, and once Marty was gone, so was he.
[9:58:07] mk_veronika: with how many times he messes things up, the character ray is gnna find him hunt or not
[9:58:08] bluguss: well why did marty and yuno leave
[9:58:08] WaltZaddy: no reason man. he did what he wanted
[9:58:09] badab1ngbadabong: betrayals were always a thing in RP
[9:58:10] qHaydos: yeah but xs character was bein fed info by lang, etc, etc to make u guys look worse so it kinda does
[9:58:13] MONSTR_UwU: fail rp on his part really
[9:58:13] IlBreeze: @jockstarraidz no shot
[9:58:14] ShutterSpeedx: Chat and he got all crazy OOC LOL
[9:58:15] ForsenOfficiaI: @phobicshrub so he decided to ruin everyone's fun and not even rp it out, still a bad excuse, man
[9:58:15] tyrannuswrecked: @jockstarraidz chill man
[9:58:16] PrehistoricViewer: you guys don't understand how hard ray c and other's to grind that money
[9:58:16] curshew: the only real answer, kinda proven by his note, is literally that he just got bored
[9:58:17] khrow: he ooc answered if you really wanna know ooc. You can find.
[9:58:18] jayyoff: i think when ott and benji made him CEO again , he saw it as them asking to get f'ed , at least what i think
[9:58:18] Bunnell: I mean you guys were warned of it happening by Marty  LUL
[9:58:19] kilugradi: i think him robing everything was forced
[9:58:22] Luke_So_Good: JP aint gonna rob you when times are bad, then you'll be suspicious @Ray__C
[9:58:22] henryhill: @Ray__C he got bitched by OTT yesterday bro yesterday
[9:58:26] MedicalMeany: He had a big rant about not wanting to play with people because of weird chat hoppers
[9:58:27] hornycoral: bro just wants to entertain his chat at the expense of everyone else's storyline
[9:58:27] djwakt: Better off without the snake X
[9:58:27] Contrail1: @Ray__C shouldn't you change your costume types so JP can't spot you so easily?
[9:58:28] phobicshrub: @ForsenOfficiaI agreed
[9:58:28] Budbleu: mickey ended the war too early? x prob didnt like that
[9:58:31] its_emannnn: yeah and Marty was right
[9:58:31] skuzzybebe: exactly LUL
[9:58:32] ninja_val: they were so right
[9:58:35] jaycedace00: GTA's real life joker
[9:58:35] KunDares: nothing he is just greedy
[9:58:37] johnmuhriddin: The Company already knew JP was going it fk them over
[9:58:38] xbabycheetosx: Maybe it's just the scorpion and the frog story
[9:58:38] guinaresg: for me after JP left the company it feels like it's not a threat or strong anymore.
[9:58:40] spliffmeister710: bro was staring a relationship then throws it right in the trash thats crazy lysO
[9:58:41] CodeForTea: probably the fact that he was obsessing with that flashdrive puzzle so the rest of the progress fell stagnant who knows
[9:58:43] saucewok: ray been running like forest gump
[9:58:47] suppressio: You can't be friends with a psychopath. JP is a monster with zero morals in game
[9:58:48] lively021: JP has done so much and contributed about 30% to the company
[9:58:48] badab1ngbadabong: @budbleu X wanted to end the war way earlier, you are way off
[9:58:48] weaky_134: What your theory on the rainbow puzzle??
[9:58:52] commonshark: @Prontle get this kid outa here jesus
[9:58:54] BoxFan112: @budbleu he wanted to end it, he just didn't want to be the one to end it
[9:58:55] MONSTR_UwU: apology tour KEKWaddle
[9:58:56] Heyyouitsmcmuffin: I’d be so mad I wouldn’t work with him til 5.0
[9:58:57] ninja_val: you guys should care.
[9:58:57] mari_sugoi: yeah they were right but in hindsight
[9:58:58] Masked_R0nin: @Budbleu The reason why is becuz they were wasting time fighting a war while Lang Crew was grinding and getting ahead.
[9:58:59] fbi_case: @ray__c love ya brother xqcL going to bed catch you tomorrow if you stream
[9:59:00] keyziiy: what he stole is more than a snake imo
[9:59:02] mugzy808: @auuunt How do you figure?
[9:59:04] lilcapt2009: What's x twirch
[9:59:04] bobylon: I thought when he left there was going to be actual RP around it, not just offline yoink everything
[9:59:06] takuu: he didnt have to rob as much as he did
[9:59:06] sargunsandhu98636: JP has done so much bullshit
[9:59:08] spixta: i think it's just JP's plan from the begining
[9:59:09] f_ingdaniel: JP did have some reservations with the company yall didt know about(at least in char) so it does make sense in character to some degree
[9:59:11] djwakt: X contributed maybe 2%
[9:59:15] shabibby: @lilcapt2009 he’s on kick
[9:59:21] RAVENRIK: @ray__c  cops needs to raid his ass
[9:59:21] IntentTaxpayer: <3 <3 <3
[9:59:21] ruby_shot: i don’t think he actually wanted to leave just was really fed up with weird chatters and is trying to make the weird chatters slow down by being with less total people
[9:59:22] OscAr_MaCeEe23: @prontle bro your still yapping omE
[9:59:23] BoxFan112: @prontle you trying to get banned in every chat? Lol
[9:59:26] remmy_6: there is some rp coming from this
[9:59:28] dammsmokey: he would have took it all if he didn’t get a error clearing the house and had to contact a dev
[9:59:29] lively021: JP contributed about 30 to 40% but he stole about 70 so its not good
[9:59:29] zakataha1: @djwakt no maybe -2%
[9:59:29] nevod002: gyatt
[9:59:30] itsjustjosh9: "warned by Marty why are you upset?" bruh he just stole 80% of their shit lmao
[9:59:31] ShaanRocks: can u get a custom plate yet for vehicles PauseChamp
[9:59:32] remmy_6: good rp*
[9:59:33] PrehistoricViewer: JP contributed like 8% KEKWiggle
[9:59:33] mugzy808: @sanesttwitchviewer Everyone is here to serve him
[9:59:33] 9thsea_ronin: rough day for company's progression raycCopium
[9:59:39] jesterconfit: I think the departure is warranted if you think of him trying to make your guard down after Marty snitched. As for the stealing part, the justification is that was his original plan that Marty snitched to the crew.
[9:59:39] AMG_2121: it’s like in rust when you get offline raided sadge
[9:59:42] commonshark: I like what blau got out of it, his RP was funny lmao @Ray__C
[9:59:44] EditorDeb: i mean it is what it is, the story goes on
[9:59:44] lively021: JP went all in for the company
[9:59:45] D3adman107: He already got raided once by the police. If he gets raided again and the cops see a huge difference of apartments in couple of days difference. Doesn't work in your favor for in court. For an eye witnesses.
[9:59:48] kilugradi: @f_ingdaniel it doesnt make sense to rob everything
[9:59:50] borderlineboredom: what are u gonna do if u catch him? u cant rob houses so the stuff is gone
[9:59:52] lazyerolust: Jamal OMEGALUL
[9:59:53] commonshark: JAMAL

[9:59:56] remmy_6: tyrick RayCAware
[9:59:58] keemotherapi: @djwakt Considering the amount of money they had to pay to get him out of debt MULTIPLE TIMES I have no doubt that contribution is in the negatives

[10:00:53] f_ingdaniel: @f_ingdaniel You obviously havent watched X play as JP, the character is meant to be an actual fucking sociopath nutcase. Its technically in character, ill agree it sucks i think it fucked up some potenially cool arcs but it makes sense
[10:00:54] daileycrutch: Ray do you have an idea now of if you wanna stay or leave The Company?

[10:01:12] CadonaTac: @keemotherapi Yeah, I think apart from the first computer and its component, the crew were the ones who sold/made everything in that basement. Included are making relationships with material gatherers, making money for the mats, etc.
[10:01:15] mugzy808: I know people are upset about the company being set back, since most of like everyone more than JP, but y'all, this did create an insane comeback arc for The Company
[10:01:16] arteries_: he saved you guys from the power bill, what a nice guy FeelsStrongMan
[10:01:18] TheKazeNA: I'm so confused how people wanted him to rp him robbing the house, shoot them and then leave them on the ground for 2 hours while he moved everything? That's not really better rp than what happened lmao

[10:01:28] jesterconfit: @D3adman107 Yeah but the thing is everyone's aware that robbing from houses is not allowed in the city, him being able to steal stuff means he lived in that house since he has access to it. It may backfire if they planned on raiding the company house as well.
[10:01:29] Poseidon510: You obviously havent watched X play as JP, the character is meant to be an actual fucking sociopath nutcase. Its technically in character, ill agree it sucks i think it fucked up some potenially cool arcs but it makes sense

[10:03:02] FunnyValentine1847: @Poseidon510 Betrayal RP is fine, but the way he executed it very poorly, really? offline raid? no rp were involved at all, literally worse than putting a gun on someone head and telling them to empty their bank accout.

[10:04:19] jesterconfit: Ray, Benji, and OTT's only option right now is the company or potentially recreating their old gangs or join a small one. Mickey will never leave since he has a different plan and arc that solely involves him and the interns so he's not much affected by the situation except for the funds.

[10:31:46] x2elitess: yeah he missed him say "her" when he was on the phone

[10:32:52] far_eviler: talking to Yuno now doesn't mean he was part of the heist though, right? because he sounded genuinely shocked to hear x took the dongle
