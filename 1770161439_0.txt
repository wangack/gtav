[0:26:37] georgehehheh: I love the unhinged Lewis displate ads the vest
[0:26:40] georgehehheh: best
[0:27:05] georgehehheh: Like "Scottish farmer Ravs"
[0:27:23] georgehehheh: And Lewis at the airport back from Ibiza
[0:28:27] georgehehheh: I'm gonna check if there's a drakon vid with the ads

[0:39:42] honeybutterbread: Thank you! kirstLvoe
[0:39:56] georgehehheh: I'm waiting to hear back about a job I really want
[0:40:24] honeybutterbread: @georgehehheh I hope you get the job kirstR
[0:40:27] georgehehheh: Have a bit less than 50% chance of an offer, but I feel I did pretty well on assessment day
[0:41:10] georgehehheh: Did well at most things except interview, but I told them I have ADHD, and I think it was obvious
[0:41:42] PSmithgamer: interviews are always the worse
[0:42:07] PSmithgamer: "Hi yes, just give me a job that I never have to speak or see anyone thanks"
[0:43:01] Magmarashi01: Basement Goblin wanted
[0:43:19] honeybutterbread: @PSmithgamer thats computer science but even then you pass to pass the normal interview and the technical interview
[0:43:30] honeybutterbread: you have to *

[0:44:33] honeybutterbread: @georgehehheh np kirstR
[0:44:47] georgehehheh: And psychometric tests before that
[0:45:23] PSmithgamer: @PSmithgamer in my experience there is still a lot of people that you have to chat to; make sure you're not stepping on others toes - but maybe that was just because of my role at the time

[0:45:24] georgehehheh: Very extensive process
[0:45:47] georgehehheh: One of 22 out of 250 applicants who got to the assessment day LUL
[0:46:11] georgehehheh: For 8 positions
[0:47:12] georgehehheh: But there was supposed to be 12 people on my day and I swear there was only 8-10 of them
[0:47:28] PSmithgamer: I once had a job that I got just because everyone else who applied couldn't do it anymore - since it took them like 4 months to get back to just CVs FeelsWeirdMan
[0:48:14] georgehehheh: hrySir jesus
[0:48:26] zindii1138: garys mode
[0:48:43] georgehehheh: I've been waiting back from Nissan for forever, still at application stage
[0:49:58] georgehehheh: And another one for which I have done final stage, I still haven't heard back from, which didn't have that many applicants. So I think I'm unlikely to get it, but I decided I don't want it anyway anymore.
[0:50:44] georgehehheh: The one I did assessment day for this week, is one I actually want
[0:51:21] PSmithgamer: Hopefully it goes well!
[0:51:26] georgehehheh: The other one I've decided to turn down because the location is too rural, nearby towns are too boring
[0:51:52] georgehehheh: But the one I want is in central Leeds, and they have lovely people in a lovely office
[0:52:34] georgehehheh: @psmithgamer hryPrayge I hope so, but also prepared in case it's bad news NODDERS
[0:53:28] PSmithgamer: Oh, I had a job interview in Leeds - it was a pain; trains were all cancelled and all over the place. I knew I wouldn't get the job the second I got there lmao

[0:54:41] georgehehheh: Yeah trains going north are a nightmare...
[0:55:44] georgehehheh: When I went to Newcastle with family to see sister, trains were cancelled, crammed into full train, and mistakes with train platform announcements
[0:56:08] georgehehheh: Luckily my trains to and from Leeds were okay LUL
