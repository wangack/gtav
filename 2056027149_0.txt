[0:18:16] vael123: @Vestfolding Hey Man, i have a very important message to share with you today. Recently i've noticed there has been an abnormal increase in people spamming big chunks of texts that makes no sense on other people's profiles,  they call it a pasta something or idrk, what even does a big chunk of text has to do with a type of Italian food that is typically made from an unleavened dough of durum wheat flour  (semolina) mixed with water or eggs, and formed into sheets or various shapes, then cooke

[6:18:22] nocherlas: @Connorbrow the +1 force mantra definitely works. if you run at a cop with a knife, expect to get shot. if you start punching them, expect to be baton'd. but the cops in this server don't have a +1 to other guns, which is unfortunate and a limitation of GTA and not the fault of the server or the RPers. the mechanics of the game unfortunately intersect with real life here

[6:24:09] hozzdoon: when ruby told you that i was dying laughing. That shit was so funny
[6:24:10] StormiNyan: @Sillyanne then rent the cars from that sketchy paleto EZ
[6:24:14] ChocolateMassage: just say a senior
[6:24:14] jacksmithcje: we have done some poor lineups before aswell like when three guys were woman
[6:24:16] sKingNA: IRL thats called a showup fyi
[6:24:17] BoldSlowbro: Ruby needs to learn also, its not bad to name drop
[6:24:19] Whiezy: whats the difference on the victim coming to you and pointing the person out at the bank or something
[6:24:19] quaylewastaken: She would be happy to through u under the bus
[6:24:25] ZachFromChat: It isnt a lineup correct lol. If you called the room anything else there'd be no confusion
[6:24:26] rdogg79: Yeah just stay away from lineup type language
[6:24:28] nocherlas: i think esfand is just asking if it's acceptable to do that. he's not asking if he can do that in exchange to a proper lineup
[6:24:33] Sillyanne: she just brought up the holes is all, like how attorneys could argue. what she said was fine
[6:24:34] ahop3777: would that be the same as saying yes to a photo?
[6:24:36] charybdes: What if a witness tells you who did it do you have to do a lineup again after they told you who the guy was? He gave you a picture of the guy.
[6:24:43] nocherlas: @Sillyanne fax
[6:24:47] TimmayHS: you were in the lineup room too, so she probably assumed
[6:24:54] MaddPursuit: 10-41 TakingNotes
[6:24:56] theProfessoR512: bro is he still talking about this antov thing lmao holy hes proud of nothing
[6:24:57] Bhasgreth: they do id's IRL, if a suspect gets away, cops put the victim in a car and drive by for ID
[6:25:05] TheLastRace: @EsfandTV I think it be the same as when a victim is IDing the person on scene. Only this just protects that witness
[6:25:17] hippiecat: ask McNulty about the 10-90
[6:25:21] ltl_wackman: yea you'd think just id'ing someone by multiple witnesses would hold some weight
[6:25:22] goChloro: @theProfessoR512 something else happened today, don't be weird
[6:25:23] ZachFromChat: @TheLastRace this 100% i agree. its not a lineup

[8:28:05] MAXATAK: lol
[8:28:05] Codex88: only thing is to have helis or bikes
[8:28:05] HistoriesPiston: it is to a certain extent, but most good drives in PD also agree that these cars are bad
[8:28:05] soosmaz74: the issue is the big speed gap between normal cars and the pd cars
[8:28:06] SmugPls: slightly weaker OMEGALUL
[8:28:06] angus1794: they shouldn't be able to escape if you slightly mess up one turn
[8:28:07] SharkzGG_: driving 3 cars at once is kinda cringe but it's a solid strat since they know there's not enough cops to chase
[8:28:07] Clodhoppr: South

[8:28:15] BoogieAnimal: Cops just have heavy nerf rn for some reason

[8:28:31] Bonnie: skill issue for sure. PD should do a thing where for one day each unit is designated to a specific area so that if there's a chase, they can all box in lmao
[8:28:32] puppietreats: Classic local s
[8:28:32] willywhen: locals at it again

[8:28:51] anthonywurpsd: why wouldnt you follow the guy that jumped out he should be primary he obvs has the $
[8:28:51] alexlipson: @alexlipson He's just a really good driver overall, and had the slightly better car. There wasn't anything esfand could've done
[8:28:53] phaden_: @Bonnierabbit PepeLaugh
[8:28:53] ArdentCause: @Bonnierabbit honestly 5head idea no lie

[8:29:44] Shonuff_: yeah, not even Bones could catch that car down the straights, it was too fast
[8:29:45] Kelborn: 170 no way these cvpis keep up
[8:29:46] zandrusz: @ArdentCause from what ive seen crims been cooking the PD in chases. Maybe they all trained during the time skip LUL

[8:29:55] ketameancomrade: Yeah it would make since to have patrols in different ares to head off chase once they start
[8:29:56] bigbobs37: what about a helicopter for tracking the cars better??
[8:29:57] Firehead94: @anthonywurpsd this is bones's scene so he makes the calls. Bones didnt see the extra and made the call to follow the car with the most people.
[8:29:58] gundam604: PD aint ready for these new heists
[8:29:58] JMacEvo: @festivekayak kinda have to, server allows groups of 6 but cars allow 4 lol
[8:29:59] stringlet: max win
[8:30:00] gravigus: these chases would be so much better if they just stopped nerfing pd tactics, tazing during car swaps, shooting tires, etc.
[8:30:01] AlbertThePanda: yeah but are the new cars even going to be that fast
[8:30:04] TheLastRace: @Bonnierabbit Comeback We miss you!!!
[8:30:06] alexlipson: He has the best turbo in that car, no shot you had a chance
[8:30:06] Codex88: why cant they use the interceptor

[8:30:43] HistoriesPiston: Are Crown Vics still used irl anymore?
[8:30:44] zandrusz: VCB
[8:30:44] ArdentCause: @zandrusz alot of the crims were into the racing in 3.0 so i believe it but its just a vehicle GAP - they have cars that have better handling, acceleration, top speed. while PD legit has like NPC cars
[8:30:47] greenbay69_2023: theirs gonna be a lot of those
[8:30:51] alexlipson: @thorstentomhuen The thing is, if the cop cars had a turbo it would be more even. His car had the strongest turbo, obv. he'll have a bigger advantage
[8:30:58] MrBASins: once the new cars are available what one do you thing you my get?
[8:30:59] pooped: thankfully crim heists are once every 1-2 weeks
[8:31:01] AajonusVonderplanitz: 4 vehicles for getaway

[8:31:14] Clodhoppr: 4 getaways is crazy oof
[8:31:17] dread_dormammu: that makes it even worse KEKW
[8:31:17] ltl_wackman: GIGACHAD cornwood when he revamps the PD
[8:31:18] BelllGoR: without crimes there's no content it should be ok they are slightly ahead progression wise
[8:31:19] realitywolfdog: 130 k USD
[8:31:19] andyjamesgames: fuckin awesome
[8:31:20] advancedwolverine: @pooped each and there are 7 total
[8:31:20] alexlipson: THEY HAVE TURBOS? OMEGALAUGHING
[8:31:20] Zolothan: have they paid you back yet?
[8:31:21] ArdentCause: if cornwood hadnt added turbos they would be like 100mph top speed
[8:31:22] thegummibearmassacre: WFAND
[8:31:23] ketameancomrade: Damn big Ballin

[8:31:34] TheHawksTalon: the interceptors have crazy acceleration though
[8:31:36] a_ato: Its just you
[8:31:37] MAXATAK: they do, hence we laughed at you saying "slightly better"
[8:31:38] NasrulAshr: and they dont even want to give you senior officer ReallyMad
[8:31:38] msdeell: man
[8:31:39] ketameancomrade: You're driving a box
[8:31:42] destinygun: @EsfandTV DNA before the dan is gone
[8:31:42] TCGK_SUBZERO: damn 99mm turbo still this bad, pd cars are bad bad
[8:31:46] Toastedgamer03: turbos can't fix a bad car when crims get better cars in general especially if they can buy and add turbos themselves
[8:31:46] Bonnie: Maximillian should make Los Santos do one purge day.
[8:31:48] wilzam100: these cars need a buff forsure
[8:31:49] MrBASins: when the new cars are you going to pull then and use than on the new cars

[8:31:55] TheLastRace: Free reign on crime thats what happenes
[8:31:56] thegummibearmassacre: LENNY
[8:31:58] gravigus: vic should be supercharger right?
[8:31:58] HistoriesPiston: @SmugPls Yeah, thats what i was thinking, so it actually makes since in Rp for the PD to get new cars anyways.
[8:31:59] Dautrat: @Bonnierabbit yea they should be divided into districts and the sgt or LT would designate units inside that district
[8:31:59] blckmephisto: @esfandtv games kind of unbalanced right now
[8:32:00] SkywalkerCush: @Haleos_x they can't yet
[8:32:01] mrs_strawberryy: LENNY Pog

[8:32:09] Jeremyohno: Susge Archer
[8:32:10] Raja_Banhammer: Susge
[8:32:12] wilzam100: unfair chase
[8:32:14] Firehead94: crown vics and cadillacs are BOATS IRL so it make sense they dont handle super well in game and have slow accel
[8:32:14] dapyman: @bonnierabbit it's that every day at Snr. Buns?
[8:32:16] dread_dormammu: Susge archer
[8:32:16] RhatTv: that has a 99mm turbo and struggles hitting 100 wtf
[8:32:18] TheHawksTalon: Susge
