[0:54:47] x3Natsu: @LuluLuvely ur eyebrows look so cute
[0:54:49] mrsgizmoo: how was palworld
[0:54:52] DylanDvsn: Wait Apex did creator skins?
[0:55:00] mimsy3938: I think the with all the leaks the new season apex could be interesting when it drops but will be ruined weeks later after people find a way to take advantage of it
[0:55:19] MrLloydP: luvelyHype1
[0:55:23] MarkusAurelius69420: 42 min Q/A clip on YT, added to my watch later list :)

[0:55:34] Absterss: Im sad i missed your r3 skin
[0:55:34] LilPeanutEnergy: There was a kinda cringe video, if I recall.
[0:55:37] DylanDvsn: Ngl if I was a company I'd be sussed out with creator skins. You never know nowadays
[0:55:39] permittedbook: ppl cheese apex just as much as the devs/ea/respawn imo

[0:56:44] phxlghg: about what are you talking about
[0:56:49] bunneclipse: why are creator codes important?
[0:56:54] babelonian16: Sims officially brought out creator codes so maybe fingers crossed others will. But it's only available through EA app or website. You can't use it on steam
[0:57:01] ikr_lees: Blowing up that truck though... top tier content lol
[0:57:06] TheRainbowFshy: I saw a video on tiktok from apex and ther showed Watson and she could change the shape of the bottom from the fences

[0:58:33] V3NU5: Playing Lifeline will be miserable if the self revive is true
[0:58:42] LilPeanutEnergy: like "last time, on GTA RP!"
[0:58:42] TheRainbowFshy: You know her fence is always round and she could make it to a square so you have it harder to reach it in buildings like that but idk if someone modded it or if it's actually true
[0:58:52] prekelross: @LilPeanutEnergy truck went BOOM
[0:59:00] DylanDvsn: @tempie Up it to 10K

[1:38:37] rae_against: @who__md okay makes sense yeah, I imagine eating fermented foods would help prevent it possibly then
[1:38:40] AnarkiPlays: No that is huge - caffeine on an empty stomach gives me insane anxiety and headache that leads to feeling drained mentally.
[1:38:41] Who__MD: Do you think its the acidity of the coffee that was causing the issue or the caffeine?
[1:38:42] wikxy_: ya water right after waking up or citrus water right after waking up apparently is best before putting anything else in there

[1:39:12] hayden_rae: what is cortisol
[1:39:18] hayden_rae: and what does it do
[1:39:20] NomoBox: As soon as I wake up. A drink a bottle of water right away
[1:39:23] rae_against: Yeah I think Huberman said on his pod that studies show you should wait at least 90 minutes after waking up before consuming coffee
