[9:03:18] KillzBob: dumpster blocking the front
[9:03:19] mickflatley82: its like 3 feet out
[9:03:19] richiethekid32: Blocking the dumpsters
[9:03:20] refreshinghotbeer: also blocking dumpsters which usually have "do not block" signs
[9:03:21] fuuhhzz: on the line isn't "within the space"
[9:03:21] GT_Alex74: On the line isn't in, because if the car in the next spot also goes on the line, then the cars collide

[9:03:30] Zaaltyr: to a reasonable amount, but the fucking TIRES are out
[9:03:31] VoltageViking: back is in traffic
[9:03:31] Wrimbles: with a precedent like that, every tow truck ever is getting impounded
[9:03:31] brontoflorist: it's not. The dumpsters are blocking half of it, so you shouldn't park there if you have a frontal lobe
[9:03:31] eelinap: its like halfway out the back of the spot

[9:03:37] zomb_pi: I'd say 2 people can't park on the line so it's not okay for 1
[9:03:37] glazedscronut: Dumpsters are the bigger play
[9:03:37] Jessesiah: if that was in any other parking spot it would be a travesty
[9:03:38] DarkSide_Jamie: Well is there a line on the other side of the car ?
