[4:35:28] Ginoveli: im so tired for some reason lol
[4:35:29] midzito: isnt that logic backwards? first time you come up with a strict plan, 2nd time you can fuck around
[4:35:31] Flashthatuuu: Can we do a poll so I can bet it all on No.

[4:35:40] Ginoveli: peepoSad
[4:35:44] Xerhro: peepoJail
[4:35:46] bbq489: did it restock yet?
[4:35:56] Imanscp: @el_showski he wants to do it, but he is actually the only person not nervous and with brain in the gang, he wants to delay for 20m, so he can do the 18k jewlery run, that can only do 2 times a day at a precise time
[4:35:57] Takeapples: always empowering  raia to stress out everyone else
[4:35:57] qtMTK: @mrgamer0909, wawa
[4:36:05] jesleaks: Raia spent 30 min enabling Wifi the other day, and now she wants to hack in a heist with 100 butcoin on the line
[4:36:06] CorveIius: wawa
[4:36:07] mrgamer0909: wawa train

[4:36:24] lgnashevich: wawa
[4:36:28] CorveIius: widewawa
[4:36:32] jbt445: its not personal i think shes taking it the wrong way
[4:36:34] m1nhtyfresh: I think if she wants to make suggestions, it should be for the next plan, not the current
[4:36:41] kidthewiz76: wawa
[4:36:47] OhkE: @Imanscp NODDERS
[4:36:51] adamm220: civ gang used to have fun during heists Aware
[4:36:52] cristina217: the girls are twinning
[4:36:53] jaswho2: someone gets told no for the first time pov om
[4:36:54] IggleGreen: Nunu just rolled Grandpa for doing the same thing om
[4:36:55] Shivie78: for chatters that are confussed btw, This is how dima plays Raia. Its not how dima is herself. Everyone who plays a character has an idea on how their character wants to evolve.
[4:36:59] IggleGreen: Raia ICANT
[4:37:07] TallYoda08: What??? om
[4:37:07] jesleaks: If Nunu is nicer, the discussion will go on for another 20 min of discussions tho @Acie
[4:37:08] slicedloxonasiago: I'm here for Raia and Vee splinter cell Arc
[4:37:10] rocking27: thats why she shouldnt lead but it is what is
[4:37:11] Bestevenn_: should change leaders each heist so everyone can do their plan
[4:37:12] Gusyyy1: @Imanscp like the last time he tried something similar and went to jail ditching the hole group
[4:37:13] Vesquix: om 󠀀
[4:37:15] VaeelL: Raia build her plan...
[4:37:22] VaeelL: can't steam with one leading
[4:37:22] mrgamer0909: Raia gonna put Nunu in her place one day lol
[4:37:24] yezzir222: @jesleaks facts
[4:37:27] 42arc: it costs 5 days butc farming
[4:37:33] jonty1998: plan change
[4:37:42] SaltiBanana: i get her point but she has to realize nunu is in the leader position only a few times she doesnt know how to address complains like jason does
[4:37:47] OhkE: @mrgamer0909 ??? what place does raia have compared to nunu....
[4:37:51] OhkE: raia is brand new
[4:38:00] qtMTK: anyone know Raia's stream? modCheck
[4:38:01] mrgamer0909: im messin
[4:38:03] bassamdrift: Tbf Nunu asked who wanted to lead the job before taking charge
[4:38:10] jbt445: and if this robbery is anything like the last one theyll hit it plenty of times
[4:38:10] mrgamer0909: @qtMTK LadyDima
[4:38:20] adamm220: raia wasnt asking to lead, just to have discussion
[4:38:21] IggleGreen: om
[4:38:23] qtMTK: NOTED thanks
[4:38:24] FRAlex010: maybe call jordan
[4:38:30] slicedloxonasiago: @OhkE To this game or this crew?
[4:38:32] OTCountdown: Jason just tells everyone to stfu lol
[4:38:36] mranqueetas: @adamm220 this
[4:38:48] OhkE: @slicedloxonasiago both
[4:38:50] iHarsh29: hazel backup check
[4:38:51] kidthewiz76: i think CIV gang lacks a true leader
[4:38:54] OhkE: @slicedloxonasiago raia is a brand new crim
[4:39:04] Imanscp: @Gusyyy1 he never tried something similar, you are talking about he going to do is stuff and not wanting to sit at house for 2 hours talking about something so eazy like this heists are
[4:39:05] Dango4: this always happen when someone starts a discussion at a wrong time, when it's decision making time
[4:39:13] bassamdrift: @kidthewiz76 you think KEKW
[4:39:16] RealWicari: @OhkE no she isnt, she used to shoot people in drivebys on her old char
[4:39:17] eFiend: @OhkE Raia yes, previous 3.0 character no.
[4:39:20] mrgamer0909: the lamp looks good there
[4:39:20] adamm220: also is someone is new, its best to have discussion so they understand everything
[4:39:23] VaeelL: @adamm220 that where the issue started week ago on heist because eveyone want to add his plan, just stick with one voice lead that not difficult
[4:39:24] DaveShadows: shrug why not tissues and kama sutra together
[4:39:25] FRAlex010: @kidthewiz76 they deffo do
[4:39:26] Obedient_potato: You also need to phone Ray and tell him his house is trash
[4:39:29] Rockhound__97: Bean bag for that corner lol
[4:39:48] OhkE: still
[4:39:48] BubFrost: @ohke wot she was there with Eugene Jason and nunu when they made the gang, how u confidently wrong om
[4:39:50] jaswho2: @Rockhound__97 absolutely not lol
[4:40:01] escay_00: vee/Acie so understanding and thoughtful. going into these expecting to get out or it to work 100% is wrong. far more skilled/experienced crews can take multiple attempts sometimes. it’s about having fun
[4:40:02] adamm220: @VaeelL realistically yes, but its also a game, and ppl want to have fun
[4:40:09] Pr0phetOG: In a RP sense, if you are about to do a robbery, and steal money, and you know cops are coming, saying, I just want to have fun, is a bit wierd.
[4:40:12] Rockhound__97: LUL LUL LUL
[4:40:13] crookedparadigm: What if the car poofs?
[4:40:15] OhkE: @BubFrost i said she is a new crim....
[4:40:15] undertothescore: Problem is there was no discussion to be had it was everyone given roles and that was it LUL
[4:40:27] slicedloxonasiago: So if/when something goes wrong, Nunu takes responsibility right?
[4:40:31] OhkE: in character.
[4:40:33] Slaydess7: @VaeelL true you need one lead voice
[4:40:44] BubFrost: @ohke ok and so is vee, what's the point
[4:40:46] OhkE: @BubFrost not talking dima ooc. im talking raia the character is new
[4:40:51] adamm220: @Pr0phetOG but then take that argument to its extreme and its just silly, so theres no point saying that
[4:40:57] Pr0phetOG: Every gang has a hacker, designated hacker, why does she have to learn?
[4:41:00] VaeelL: @adamm220 that ok it's the first one after you can be more smooth and a fun way
[4:41:06] OhkE: @BubFrost so technically nunu has years experience over both of them
[4:41:08] belllis_: deffintely better when everyone knows how to hack
[4:41:09] OhkE: ?
[4:41:22] cristina217: the memory one is cool
[4:41:23] x_amer__: no cam and focus ?!
[4:41:23] undertothescore: So whats the plan 3 people inside 2 drivers outside?
[4:41:28] jonty1998: civ gang discussion turns 2 different plans side quest then peanut situation
[4:41:29] Kenjack1984: yeah but that was like the 6th time doing it that is when you should try out other people not the first time doing the job
[4:41:31] kidthewiz76: There gang is like a spider with no head and every leg trying to go somewhere
[4:41:36] Flashthatuuu: Vee going to jail finally.
[4:41:39] adamm220: @VaeelL i think progressively every heists its becoming more military and less fun, raia notices, shouldnt be about chasing a W
[4:41:44] Ghallumn: @Pr0phetOG that's bad since you have to depend on solely one person
[4:41:44] jesleaks: 100 bitcoin is on the line, why not just use the best hackers?
[4:41:54] t_r_a_i_t: Please don't drive, ever
[4:41:58] Mormis: Well her point of view is kinda, whats the most fun? Not whats the most effective or easy
[4:41:59] KiloCaeso: could u use Ash as a Hostage
[4:42:01] t_r_a_i_t: LUL
[4:42:24] VaeelL: she take a new one
[4:42:24] midzito: @KiloCaeso no fake hostages
[4:42:26] florda: she found another one
[4:42:29] joac1144: She found a real one
[4:42:32] t_r_a_i_t: The VoD when you got Nunu and Tolan arrested was hilarious though
[4:42:39] jonty1998: Jason tries 2 lead but the gang doesn’t listen unless he is stern
[4:42:42] BludScape: oh no tolan erp arc
[4:42:44] dangwifi: always sus of cyclists LUL
[4:42:50] PrimeNYC: they left vee?
[4:42:59] el_showski: ramee always on a bike cruising careful with that sneaky guy lol
[4:43:03] Rokuach: NOPERS
[4:43:08] Pr0phetOG: @Ghallumn Sure, you can have a backup, clay/vee, having every person in the house trying hacks is silly. Just go try them out on github if you wanna do that. Eugene is the driver, he is not asking to do this or that every run.
[4:43:10] El_pernil: sitt
[4:43:28] Kenjack1984: check the tablet you should see if they bought it

[4:44:26] Tenivir: yeah not all hacks and stuff will fit everyone
[4:44:28] Dango4: GOOD LUCK WITH HACK VEE
[4:44:30] DustonKing: chat.. they are streamers dima is asking to try a hack for her stream. stop bullying
[4:44:34] PRE5TO_: you just gotta wait for the main hack to be roofrunning
[4:44:35] Zann41: i wish Ash streams her shit talk is soo funny
[4:44:38] Alaineman: @MarkMakesArt he hasn't streamed gta for a while now sadge

[4:45:16] SaltiBanana: @kidthewiz76, maybe but he is def the best they got
[4:45:17] Ghallumn: @Pr0phetOG the house realistically has two drivers/hackers we all know what happens when even only one is missing. its better to have more than less
[4:45:24] LoneWolf_N7: why are they parking the getaway car next to their house? KEKW
[4:45:26] jaswho2: benji explained the hacks  in riddles lol

[6:23:19] iishie_: she remembered what happened after ocean dump
[6:23:28] MillaZenik: the thing is jack told vee he likes her and doesn't want her to get hurt, so Vee will likely be safe

[6:24:19] piyuoo: @DreamsPeek Thats not enough to prioritize them over own family
[6:24:20] Dango4: lumber union has another girl. maybe that's who vee saw?
[6:24:21] Flugger1: You never get banned right after things happen, admins will have to look at it first. But I don't think the girl was banned
[6:24:25] Beltano: @ZitroneSimo No idea
[6:24:32] MillaZenik: I don't think she got banned, I think she took a break
[6:24:39] theace8869: if she ask for an apology it’s war. Rai said she wouldn’t apologize and I doubt Nunu will

[6:25:31] Beltano: Jack is literally the answer
[6:25:39] x_amer__: maybe its mats and Vee will do the deal alone , just like raia did with CG @acie
[6:25:40] DreamsPeek: @piyuoo In what situation would that be happening
[6:25:56] adamm220: vee literally is one of jacks best customers, makes no sense to start a war

[6:26:04] Capt4inJuli: There wont be a war, Jack just wanted to get some spice going
[6:26:05] Strifes_de: you can
[6:26:16] MillaZenik: who was it that said Jack + Vee political marriage?

[6:26:28] XEEDOUS: ew don't be pussy
[6:26:29] DreamsPeek: Part of the whole issue is the reason people get ocean dumped sometimes, so we've seen what happens when you say Hey you ocean dumped me
[6:26:31] Liink93: Jack only have her story, meeting needed
[6:26:35] simmeringteapot: paying wouldn't be enough, they want anh apology too

[6:27:16] Rockhound__97: Credit   credit  thats the save :)
[6:27:18] blackberrycurve8530: conflict is fun, and it will resolve itself eventually
[6:27:20] adamm220: Jack is the owner of the company, shes an employee, he could stop everything tbh...
[6:27:20] evkay: Gang life is all about picking sides tbh most times you gotta pick one
[6:27:21] king_atj2: i think one big group meeting could solve it or at least get both perspectives in the open
[6:27:21] simmeringteapot: @theace8869 yeah
[6:27:22] Rliy: maybe talk to jack abt the girl said, maybe he will understand peepoTalk
[6:27:23] Tyreck: what about the credit thing with Jack?
[6:27:25] MillaZenik: i think ur friendship with jack is safe, he really seemed like this was something his people want, not him
[6:27:34] vlr900: well they have guns and gonna smoke civ gang
[6:27:35] joyoruz: marry jack and make him choose between that girl
