[1:15:21] shin5sato3: @EsfandTV it would be like Kuzco and Izma in The Emperor's New Groove where she pretends to be in power
[1:15:21] SageKingdom: Yeah but for a month we have been watching pd vs capitains so I don't want to see them go to sherrifs

[1:15:25] bonobonobon0: im a filthy cop watcher
[1:15:27] Zewelly: i think cops reach pretty far with their rp tho, like weird hunches imo
[1:15:27] blowaways: people invested timelines in arcs and want the payoff
[1:15:29] wijj99: those are parasocial chatters just ignore them
[1:15:31] ZachFromChat: Cornwood needs someone much more serious as his undersheriff

[1:15:40] garbagoo: i watched the whole Mr. K officer johnson thing yuesterday from both POV and it was HILARIOUS
[1:15:41] HavocusRex: Idk, the point of the sherrifs office is to have a different leadership approach is it not? bring same leader would be questionable

[1:32:49] slayerman_x: @EsfandTV yeah but viewers can be critical about which sponsor you choose. When a game is bad and you cant critic it whiile getting sponsored
[1:32:49] MACBS_: KEKW
[1:32:49] Vexamas: If there's a couple people that say something, when you're sitting at 12k viewers which ostensibly means you're having a lot of random viewers, it's not that big of a deal - however when you spotlight it, it makes it a big deal
[1:32:49] Chickenplucker26: Being critical makes streamer look bad, lowers streamer chance of getting early reviews on the future and could possibly hurt future sponsorships.
