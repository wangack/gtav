[0:53:23] GoutOfWar: @Rool_Gonzalez your coworker is putting wear on his synchros, synchros aren't meant to put wear on, that's what a clutch is for
[0:54:19] MrVlume: just take one from a intern

[0:57:20] GoutOfWar: @Paralyzor apples to oranges i'm not talking about 18 speed gearboxes on trucks, if you do that on a 6 speed your transmission is going to give out before your clutch
[0:57:32] CANT_STOP_SAM: wtf he maxed out in like 2-3 days

[1:00:36] TastyKudzu: The new goal is structural instead of rep. Getting the systems setup so that they run smoothly with people growing, pushing, etc.

[1:02:07] bird24287: can’t wait for the eve shit show too lol this week going to be juicy
[1:02:15] TastyKudzu: I wonder with the pushers you guys have the max amount of weed you can churn through a day if you buy all 3 sellers. Like what's the maximum throughput?
[1:02:17] sbarnard5: @MADxBACKWARDS cant transfer cars yet
[1:02:46] Yetiee: Think someone hired a lawyer to make a title transfer

[1:04:18] TastyKudzu: I thought it was funny when they called him a rat because he don't care. Like he owns that mask.
[1:04:28] Eku007: @cheep_wow Funniest is people telling Harry they are disappointed that he chose to snitch RP as he is a Don. People were saying he deserves ban for fail RP KEKLEO
[1:04:40] UnluckyPhil: RatLord
[1:05:07] TastyKudzu: I still think everyone choosing new app names like "Jean Paul" and "Ray Romanov" would be funny af.
[1:05:31] limpingmonke: Is speedy still on the block
