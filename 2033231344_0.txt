[0:32:53] Tuturruu_: Maybe make it so you can recycle keys when swapping locks
[0:32:54] quadity2: Everyone with permissions should be able to change locks i feel like
[0:32:58] blackpoolftw: can he do that???!!!
[0:33:02] NebelKop: a good system would be that you can ask judges to get "free" or cheaper keys back and the robbers still have time to rob.... mhm
[0:33:02] epic_smee: @Nidas literally make keys 100$ and lockchange 1k$. easy fix . so you can still access it, but you dont bankrupt someone
[0:33:04] Mantelrorelsen: Maybe a safety keychain?
[0:33:05] Madsouthafrican07: Key pad for the win.
[0:33:10] NemisizZ: maybe even have them decay fair quick, like a week then it needs to be renewed
[0:33:11] reagon_plays: and if you ocean dump the person after robbing them then go to house clean it up that would be idk waht
[0:33:17] gostonko: hes reducing prio guys
[0:33:19] gostonko: nobody is safe
[0:33:30] santilloo88: and if the one who ownes the house needs to changes it right?
[0:33:41] reagon_plays: it needs to be monitored with harsh rules
[0:33:44] Izy7: i would just pay lovemore 1k to be doorman and you won't need any keys
[0:33:45] NamekSlayer: There are pros and cons to it
[0:33:50] Tr3sk0: Key prices are too expensive
[0:33:51] epic_smee: spawning in houses is so awkward
[0:33:52] NemisizZ: have them being like 100 pr, then have them decay in a few days tops
[0:33:54] PantherVlll: stuck in the backrooms
[0:33:55] ikrstfu: @Izy7 OMEGALUL
[0:34:01] NebelKop: same... its just bad that you need to pay soo much for new keys
[0:34:05] wasited95: u dont need to have the keys on u
[0:34:18] Kazeumi: did you spawn both times at last location?
[0:34:26] LietK: Hide yo keys hide yo wife
[0:34:32] NebelKop: @wasited95 but thats the fun part about it

[0:35:39] reagon_plays: this is gonna be a lot of discussion to maintain this mechanic KEKW
[0:35:44] ptvgrjbdr: Key system needs some tweaking
[0:35:50] ELEGlGGLE: so it wasnt COMPLETLY random then
[0:36:10] epic_smee: @ptvgrjbdr just make it cheap cheap. so its not a financial attack on someone but more of a race to the house after getting a key.
[0:36:40] LietK: Gonna have to water board the guy
[0:36:44] imsnokys: Wait didnt they buy a different house?
[0:36:53] NemisizZ: lol prices is so whack on things

[0:37:29] Congiii: is raffle today?
[0:37:35] Xpatrol: yeah but 3k by key is hard
[0:37:36] clowniusthe1st: reagon_plays not wrong
[0:37:39] Paupor: You could also just not run around with the key on you though
[0:37:51] Mantelrorelsen: They could earn good money with a key-printer
[0:37:57] epic_smee: if keys were cheap , the incentive to rob a key at random would be not there anymore. which is a good thing. it should be a targeted attack to rob a key and a race to the house
[0:37:58] rjoconnor: If you're going to do the rust thing though, you should be able to progress to a code lock on the door
[0:38:04] Xpatrol: they can wipe out everything
[0:38:06] Fishnet83: If they wanna keep the system the key price gotta be waaay cheaper
[0:38:13] ikrstfu: Evilge
[0:38:16] meego0o: abit op
[0:38:16] thajollypirate: i think that if you just lower the key price its fine
[0:38:17] ptvgrjbdr: Robbing randoms without good reasons is the biggest problem here tbh
[0:38:19] gungabruh: I think it would be better if you cant just copy keys easily
[0:38:25] harucanne: MEGALUL
[0:38:26] chilledcakemaker: Test it out on Larry's house maybe? With his key
[0:38:27] gostonko: TheThingAboutTheRPEcoSystemIs
[0:38:28] reagon_plays: down the line you can have pin locks also for the house
[0:38:41] mariuspure: there should be a rp mechanism to the key cloning, not just a mechanic
[0:38:41] NemisizZ: i kinda feel prices is super inflated already, ppl earn to much, prices gets out of control, like how much was a drying rack... its 6 wooden sticks or how much it is...
[0:38:43] Congiii: should be able to do the classic key under doormat
[0:38:48] LietK: Need security code that pings cops
[0:38:49] JamesDwho: need some sort of Master Keying system that allows you to selectively re-key

[1:32:49] svan223: till dez is awake
[1:33:00] epic_smee: @IMVbg an easy fix would be to make keys very cheap. stealing a key shouldn't be a financial attack on someone at random, but rather a targeted attack to rob someone. and if the keys are cheap its more of a race and you have to know who you rob

[1:36:54] clowniusthe1st: the whole key thing was an issue before this but i wont go into it coz yknow
[1:36:55] epic_smee: it's just griefing without a lot of RP behind it.
[1:37:06] IEEKl: @Leonaus_ Simple solution, only 1 key to one house. Never carry a key unless you're going directly to the house. If you have the key, never travel alone or unarmed
[1:37:07] highrollergambler: conflict gonna get spicy for sure
[1:37:09] meego0o: startrd already in NA

[1:37:32] tarm38: ya its going to end up like all pocketwipes in wars - one dude takes a key, the robbed guy takes keys every time he can from then on, suddenly the whole city is keyless
[1:37:37] nate921269: the thing about it is is people have to treat house keys like the old meth lab keys and be careful just gotta get use to treating it like that
[1:37:39] Brodoswagings: i thiunk its good for rp and money sinks usual good for economy aswell
[1:37:40] ptvgrjbdr: 10K at least
[1:37:46] Leonaus_: Its gonna get to the point where if too many people know where you live, one day youre gonna have a small verbal altercation and a few hours later 6 guys rob you at your front door and take all your shit

[1:40:54] mariuspure: @reverserakesh nah but you just look up the houses sold and camp them KEKW
[1:40:56] Leonaus_: @Leonaus_ then it goes back to digital keys and devs realise certain realistic mechanics like this one aren't good for server health
[1:41:02] Sehpron: @reverserakesh did you recently steal a key Susge

[2:56:45] epic_smee: imo an easy fix is to make them very cheap, that way there has to be RP behind stealing it. you would need to know where they live and literally race there against them.
