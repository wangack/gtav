[1:21:53] doc_sharon: yeah, infractions can happen without going directly to blooding out yesyes
[1:21:56] doc_sharon: Yesyes
[1:22:02] IchibaToll: Attitude may be reflective of larger issues, but it seems way early in the process regardless.
[1:22:13] A_Humble_Wooper: Yeah, any time a gang bloods someone out there's a decent chance of a perma. At minimum it should be treated as a serious possibility not to be taken lightly. katesPlot
