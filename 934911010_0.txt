[1:28:42] Valaphar: the product price is flexible with quality, but with cost it doesnt make sense though?
[1:28:43] sacelera: @tjfulp he doesn't make money from what the sellers make. He gets paid for the product by the pushers and then the pushers make money from selling the product on the streets

[1:29:32] massive_legend420: do u guys think that making 100 pure is more imporatant then the key decaying?
[1:29:49] EvidentGhost: @massive_legend420 yes
[1:29:52] easedel: donuts > meth lol
[1:29:56] Fort3: but, if on the way to perfecting the process they end up making some lower qual batches, obviously you use that strategically
[1:30:17] easedel: circle back.... KEKW
[1:30:21] tjfulp: @jewddamhussein got it. Didn’t realize he would first sell the product before vagos would have a chance to get it
[1:30:25] Valaphar: making lower than ~61% loses them money, so yes 100% is more important

[1:33:59] DemonicFaith: I imagine a new cook trying to compete against you would have to take consistent loss until Rep goes up to make them worth buying from
[1:34:00] tjfulp: Won’t the sellers stop selling around the vagos territory if they keep getting robbed?
[1:34:00] RezaQ8: So you are saying it would be good for them to sink in hours into building up the rep with the strain first then they are basically stuck with you
[1:34:01] DreamX2: is the key decay intentional btw?
[1:34:11] FlowerWater_: I think thats kind of what should happen with people who are good at hacking the fleecas. SHould markeyt themselves as hackers for hire

[5:48:39] aahleas: i mean churros are better cause they cause ingredient. meth should be better yet

[5:48:45] aahleas: cost*
[5:48:50] EvidentGhost: would make more robbing stores teosLaugh
[5:48:53] BolbiBaggins: JamesPog That's a great profit Kappa
[5:48:58] Purplevivid: The only viable option is to cook for yourselves hahahah
[5:49:02] Minty_Squinty: thats horrendous
[5:49:11] DudleyIsDumb: Yeah the price of each bag at 24 is way too much. To make cooking more profitable they should double the output. That would not change the overall market but make cooking profitable
[5:49:14] Tweker: @Purplevivid sadly this is what this looks like...

[5:49:51] 80b101: Not even cover coffee cost uhnKek
[5:49:55] Tweker: @Purplevivid and if they balance it around people selling to pusher the next person that gets the key might just sell themselves and be printing money
[5:49:58] Meikai: @TheRarePotato I said speedbuffs.
[5:50:08] WillBeFree: wait nino bought meth?
[5:50:10] Meikai: Movement speed.

[5:51:38] TheRarePotato: @Meikai oh tbh I'd be for deleting most of food buffs like oxy cheeps that makes no sense
[5:51:43] bogahey: 400 bags going to sell quick
[5:51:48] GodzillaMonkey01: I just dont get how they justified doubling the buy in just for 4 extra bags
[5:51:50] tehepikduck1: Damn James down bad already classSad  classSad
[5:51:51] Rynnkari: @rawreefer Hahahaha. trie/
[5:51:52] Minty_Squinty: at these numbers its like 2k profit per hour, you make more fishing, it just isnt worth it
[5:52:05] DudleyIsDumb: Yeah why was the buy in doubles
[5:52:09] Rynnkari: true*
[5:52:12] goldenprey: just give it to the pd for 3mil and be done with it
[5:52:13] tehepikduck1: If he doesn't say "say my name" during this RP i'll be very sad
[5:52:46] Pepsiguy2009: @actual_nicotine they gave it to him since he is the bugtester KEKLEO he will be inclined to deal with the scuff lol
[5:52:48] Meikai: @TheRarePotato Combat based food items were a mistake. Makes drugs worthless and oxy is a drug. Wdym?
[5:52:51] BolbiBaggins: @Actual_Nicotine with how the city is now set up with donuts, tea, and every other buffed item, i feel like in a way that is the case. Moving the drug-oriented RP of 2.0 to food/civ for 3.0
[5:53:14] Sinatrafy: uhnHm
[5:53:16] DudleyIsDumb: Not even making more than fishing uhnKek
[5:53:18] GhostBabyAlien8: Donuts 🍩 is just too good

[5:53:36] russlord1: its for the rp Saab damn
[5:53:39] TheRarePotato: @Meikai yeah that's what I mean, why even have substitutes for drugs anyway
[5:53:58] The_crews_camel: Why windowed mode?
[5:53:59] h0neybadgerz: this seems very unprofitable for the amount of work that is needed to be put in it

[5:54:22] El_Nalgon123: @The_crews_camel those are IMMERSION BARS BRO

[5:54:33] Actual_Nicotine: I hope it all balances out though, because the next stage of the RP this could bring would be awesome
[5:54:38] uni0n1: @UberHaxorNova what if you sold half to neno and split the other half to sell yourselves
[5:54:43] Pepsiguy2009: @the_crews_camel  cover meta stuff

[5:54:58] sharkczar: @uni0n1 would make less money
[5:55:03] WillBeFree: i feel like 10k for a bag is a good price and the buyer sells for 600
[5:55:03] Kyndagh: Yeah
[5:55:05] massive_legend420: everyone has to lose to make
[5:55:09] brittanywittany: If there was a gang war, meth's armor perk would be valuable.  But right now...
[5:55:10] Sinatrafy: uhnNotes
[5:55:15] BolbiBaggins: huh
[5:55:28] aahleas: chat im confused. has siz confirmed that the demand raises after usage? like do people get addicted?
[5:55:37] Actual_Nicotine: coke money in 2.0 was insanely unbalanced
[5:55:39] BPJulio: uhnCozy uhnCozy uhnCozy
[5:55:46] Minty_Squinty: @Sangr3al yes
[5:55:49] massive_legend420: yea coke money in 2.0 was insane
[5:55:56] uni0n1: at first
[5:56:00] TheRarePotato: @Meikai that's why I like the system in 2.0 where all of the food buffs would weight a lot if civs wanted it
[5:56:11] The_crews_camel: Selling real meth doesn’t involve this much math
[5:56:11] Sinatrafy: uhnMoney
[5:56:17] Klax04: it would get you caught on the street selling by gangs as well
[5:56:17] massive_legend420: im not gonna judge the sales of meth when it hasent even started
[5:56:19] h0neybadgerz: @Sangr3al Yeah theyve tested it, it goes up by one whole dollar each time kekw
[5:56:25] aahleas: @minty_squinty cause i was there when they had the talk about trying to get people addicted i think nino suggested it. so he was right i guess. then u gotta dumb a whole lot of money first
[5:56:38] DudleyIsDumb: @massive_legend420 but just doing the math the profits for the cooks is really fucking bad uhnKek
[5:56:41] Valaphar: at this point adding nino seems to cut into the already low profit margins
[5:56:43] aahleas: dump**
[5:56:46] Quintessential_Bulbasaur: 🐵 🍌
[5:57:17] Meikai: @TheRarePotato 3.0 feels like beta testing atm. Unless Meth has some hidden buffs that Siz doesn't know about. Like no fall damage.
[5:57:18] Pipopip1: you be nino LUL
[5:57:28] DonCig: Nino can also push for more profits in the long run with his marketing skills
[5:57:49] kushd: or find a different buyer thats willing to pay more than nino..
[5:57:49] CappuccinoCup: the meth lab mechanics feels like it was made for a south side gang to own, hold down and sell
[5:58:10] Actual_Nicotine: @Meikai it's almost like drug prices are closer to IRL, but for some reason it's $80 to buy a burger LUL
[5:58:36] sonasne: the selling of meth on the street seems more like an option to get rid of meth you don't want any more, not to make a huge amount of money
[5:58:50] dr_enthusiatick: saab master chef
[5:58:56] james6562: It’s crazy how everyone is RPing now. Bandwagoners
[5:59:01] imSammers: what if the meth system is meant to make and sell direct? Like the numbers aren't good for cooking, selling to a distributor, and distributor selling to peddlers?
[5:59:13] DudleyIsDumb: For cooking the buy in should be brought back down to 2k, and the output should be increased more. That would only effect the profits of the cooks and not make it so bad @uberhaxornova
[5:59:15] sahnteeno: ???
[5:59:29] Bumblebee831: !uptime
[5:59:30] Nightbot: UberHaxorNova has been live for 5 hours 59 minutes 48 seconds

[5:59:48] 0xygenhomie: i think manny understand the time investment to make this work. im not so sure about saab
[5:59:51] Purplevivid: The 4k buy in is rough
[5:59:59] 0xygenhomie: idk if saab is ready to ride this out
[6:00:03] FrunzeApparatchik: @james6562 WeirdChamp
[6:00:05] esrou: With three you can have people in and out
[6:00:07] uni0n1: it seems that the money is dependent on the sale price of the drug
[6:00:12] Actual_Nicotine: @DudleyIsDumb I guess it's hard to strike a balance. Like Saab said, if it's like the old system, suddenly everyone has a 500k car within a week
[6:00:23] 0xygenhomie: this is gonna be a long grind to see profits
[6:00:24] GodzillaMonkey01: Higher output also doesnt mean more money, keeping it rare can also drive prices up. Its a lot of stuff to consider
[6:00:34] uni0n1: i feel like you need 1k per bag for this to work
[6:00:47] GhostBabyAlien8: Fleeca banks way more profitable than meth uhnKek
[6:00:48] aahleas: i mean shouldnt they prolly mass produce now to push to locals the extra to get them more addicted?
[6:00:54] DudleyIsDumb: @actual_nicotine yeah but these profits aren’t good. And it would only effect the cooks profit. It would change the profit from garbage to feasible
[6:01:11] trumbo_o: did i miss why the buy in doubled or was that an ooc thing uhnHm uhnNotes
[6:01:11] imSammers: @GodzillaMonkey01 ya but... the rep thing means they need to get a constant source or else ppl buying wont get what they need out of it... they just wont profit
[6:01:25] Zineth57: do donut and coffee effects stack?
[6:01:27] OdinGodOfVictory: uhnBless
[6:01:34] Actual_Nicotine: @DudleyIsDumb I agree the cooks need more due to a) effort and knowledge involved and b) risk of the 9's
[6:01:34] Minty_Squinty: uhnPeep
[6:01:40] sonasne: maybe the devs want the money to be made by selling to players who want to use it and it's not meant to be a money generator
[6:01:42] GhostBabyAlien8: @zineth57 ye
[6:02:01] The_crews_camel: Chat, CZ97 bd, or Glock 21 ?
[6:02:06] Valaphar: 400 doesnt even recoup your costs though? You'd need to push like 50 batches to even make back the investment?
[6:02:06] Ham_Alh: Yikes
[6:02:10] DudleyIsDumb: @actual_nicotine and the way to increase their profit without effecting the overall market directly would be to decrease cost to make, and increase the direct output
[6:02:13] Kyndagh: @sonasne Then that wouldn't make sense to make it this complicated
[6:02:15] Pepsiguy2009: no SHAT
[6:02:16] imSammers: @GodzillaMonkey01 also, dry spells are gonna make people wanna kill the cooks lol
[6:02:17] BolbiBaggins: @The_crews_camel Mozambique

[6:06:51] GhostBabyAlien8: @uberhaxornova actually yeah. Does it matter if you lose the key? You can just leave the door open
[6:06:51] LijeBaley: EEeeh
[6:06:54] Kyndagh: City fluctuates so much right now economically that changing the price in the next month might result in less negative sentiment than otherwise might've happened
[6:07:02] Valaphar: @Actual_Nicotine yeah i agree CG would definitely use/buy it with their funds atm imo
[6:07:04] seismicpigeon: if more jobs are popping up, there will be a desire for meth to those groups
[6:07:05] arkoin: maybe keep 1 batch for youself for profit?
[6:07:07] buttermode: Maybe u need the moonshine
[6:07:15] Actual_Nicotine: @seijiro_a locks every tsunami
[6:07:23] GhostBabyAlien8: @actual_nicotine OOOF
[6:07:29] LijeBaley: YAES YAES YAES 🐔 dick
[6:07:32] imSammers: @Actual_Nicotine if you think dealing to Locals isn't going to generate RP, you're totally wrong... the places they deal is gonna be a hotspot, pushers are gonna get robbed and chased by police... there's no worries there.
[6:07:33] GhostBabyAlien8: that sucks
[6:07:36] willdanger_: gotta crack the code

[6:07:54] sahnteeno: Do you think that having to wait a week to see your results is a little too much?
[6:08:01] uni0n1: @UberHaxorNova do you think there could be a outside product you could added to the batches
[6:08:03] Actual_Nicotine: @imSammers I mean street dealing in 2.0 had zero RP and it was in the SS too. We'll see i guess
[6:08:06] seismicpigeon: @uberhaxornova what if u sell to people that will personal use it more for a higher price so that you can sell to people that are building rep at a lower price
[6:08:15] Minty_Squinty: runescape KEKW
[6:08:16] Zineth57: can't you give some to nino, for his boys to push and report back to you?

[6:08:19] GodzillaMonkey01: Even if you have to renegotiate, at least you have the upper hand with the knowledge. Still awk tho
[6:08:28] CappuccinoCup: i predict massive bitching when the product hits the streets then the devs will simplify the process and make it profitable uhnKek
[6:08:31] tombovard: KEKW
[6:08:31] Valaphar: @imSammers but with their monopoly atm, they control the market, to take advantage of it they'd need to not sell it to grinders to even recoup their investment
[6:08:34] Niney_Who: RNG NODDERS
[6:08:35] imSammers: @Actual_Nicotine nah - i'm not talking about months from now... when it hits the streets watch Mike Block come out lol
[6:08:39] Delfryngr: the gods of rp are trolling KEKLEO
[6:08:39] LijeBaley: Oh God. Like Real Life Sadge
[6:08:44] dreamwalker213: The fact that crime/wars are down compared to 3.0 means no one is gonna pay all that extra money just for the armor. Right now they just want the speed boost so they’ll get donuts
[6:08:46] Glancing: it was rng all along PepeLaugh
[6:08:47] KingPresiden: these what ifs aren't helping

[6:09:22] Demon_zx: @seismicpigeon that has been his plan for weeks
[6:09:23] Actual_Nicotine: @imSammers yeah it could also just degenerate into trap-house RP Sadge
[6:09:23] GhostBabyAlien8: @drzombiegamer more like sell Dean the key

[6:10:35] Klax04: best case you three just use all the meth yourselves on a massive bender
[6:10:36] sonasne: worst case scenario meth is just an RP prop which isn't that bad tbh
[6:10:36] otisbdriftwood_: doing great thnx @maxtabin hope ur doing well
[6:10:36] uni0n1: i think you guys could figure it out

[6:11:32] Amatoric: im slow dont flame me fam
[6:11:33] Actual_Nicotine: @imSammers yeah i'm optimistic too, but even with jobs we're seeing the same ol' grinders unfortunately.
[6:11:34] uni0n1: @UberHaxorNova the other thing is if the devs adjust things who knows what that means
[6:11:35] LolmanScott: they have been splitting it first
[6:11:44] GhostBabyAlien8: I bet the devs are watching this vod right now and changing the code

[6:12:11] rampaige_x: i feel like everything will work out in the end
[6:12:14] Captainglorydays: Banished to meth purgatory
[6:12:20] Actual_Nicotine: And DW seems to be really proactive to what's going on and making rapid adjustments
[6:12:21] Niney_Who: There is no Siz, just Meth Cook #1 JamesRust
[6:12:23] Sciencegun: the payoff of a job well done :)
[6:12:23] DrZombieGamer: you do have 30k doe. which is top 20 percent of the city prob LUL
[6:12:24] sonasne: spending so much time in the lab instead of developing other storylines
[6:12:24] Valaphar: modCheck meth money
[6:12:27] imSammers: @Actual_Nicotine when people become desensitized there will be grinders that kinda go through the motions... but i mean who even watches grinders, those are usually people who rarely interact and are flying under the radar
[6:12:27] EvidentGhost: starving artist LUL and our art is meth
[6:12:27] koffsyrup: Beta testing for the next group

[6:13:48] Soffeli: NODDERS
[6:13:51] buttermode: If meth is gone poop. At least u still got the tavern.
[6:13:55] S13M: uwuHMM
[6:13:56] kingkongsbigdong420: imagine if they didnt kill VIP
[6:14:01] YautjaGod: Man who knew making drugs was just pwessing shiny burtons
[6:14:35] massive_legend420: pwessing the burtons do be hard tho
[6:14:43] vov_ochka: oi mate
[6:14:48] Purplevivid: Hope gun making is somewhat like this
[6:14:52] DrZombieGamer: if it comes down to it. since you own the Tavern just cash yourself 15k. 5k of that would be Labor from Casino night
[6:14:54] uni0n1: @UberHaxorNova i got an idea what if you guys kept the 100
[6:14:56] YautjaGod: @massive_legend420 But very saturafying
[6:15:24] Actual_Nicotine: For top-shelf sales, I reckon you need to organise raves or parties like Ava used to do for LSD. You'd sell shitloads
[6:15:43] LijeBaley: Have an easter egg for it
