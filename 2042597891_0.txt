[3:53:19] JoeayIV: the only thing Tessa knows how to do
[3:53:23] jimothy64: Yeah Juno's default upset move being "get drunk and then parade it in front of Tessa" is more than a little toxic.. especially as that's also how she responded to Tessa being upset at her..
[3:57:57] Jen848: duckPls
[4:00:00] retrowolf0498: The amount of times I've jumped on American Truck Sim and only expected to be on for an hour or two and it turned in 6-8 hours is surprisingly high.

[4:02:22] JoeayIV: i can snag a picture if you want
[4:02:24] retrowolf0498: I believe a bowler
[4:02:33] jimothy64: He had basically the same hat you drew on the Couso duck

[4:09:33] jimothy64: Draw the diagonals as four separate lines, they don't really connect
[4:10:00] JoeayIV: ?????

[4:10:11] Chiracho: ngl that worked. i can see a union jack
[4:11:33] puffsOG: Just joined. @JoeayIV had me all excited with "WEED TIME"
[4:11:38] nobodybodon: spending more time on a flag than on the entire rest of the drawing
[4:11:59] leydann: can't not get the flag right.
[4:13:12] jimothy64: You know how nobody ever gets the US flag right with a quick freehand? The Union Flag is the same for us Brits, there's weird offsets on the diagonals for one..
[4:13:52] leydann: yeah. So many people put it up upside down because of it
[4:13:55] puffsOG: nakkiLove
[4:14:32] nobodybodon: no one gets the canadian flag right either but thats just because no one can draw a maple leaf

[4:17:00] nobodybodon: its not the reference thats the issue
[4:17:00] jimothy64: Now just imagine how complicated it would be with the other national flags incorporated.. the union flag is just three of them.. imagine if we added the Welsh dragon to it
[4:17:07] Darth_hedgehog: drawing moar Ducks nakkiAw
[4:17:13] highvoltagehd_: that drawing is so good
[4:17:14] nobodybodon: the shape is just horrible

[4:18:13] JoeayIV: https://i.imgur.com/IgvC36N.png see its so hard to draw
[4:18:18] JoeayIV: why so many points????

[4:21:52] nobodybodon: I had to look it up, its not even a triangle, both points are slightly downwards pointing

[7:32:29] UmbrellaFox: but 100+k
[7:32:31] JoeayIV: its way better than mustard
[7:32:57] jimothy64: With how many people are in the group, 100k in a day should be totally doable if people committed

[7:51:36] Zubins: oh god here we go lol
[7:51:39] UmbrellaFox: THE STUFF CAN WAIT WTF Madge STFU
[7:51:49] jimothy64: Tessa's 50 is kinda tied to buying the actual house
[7:52:00] UmbrellaFox: ^
[7:52:21] jimothy64: Literally everyone was on board with the one Tessa wants, then Carlo comes along
[7:52:23] brbdoo: It's gonna be a long time before better houses open up, functionally speaking
[7:52:37] Zubins: There it is
[7:52:38] QuesoCommander: this is the first time Tessa's heard any of this pretty sure
[7:52:49] UmbrellaFox: Madge take your money with you
[7:53:00] jimothy64: Can't really do that with the 50k.. it has an implicit use case
[7:53:01] happy_questionmark: so many ups and downs FeelsBadMan
[7:53:01] LissaB: Guess Flop get's his money back real fast then
[7:53:05] UmbrellaFox: they literally don't want to work one day to make that money for the pcs
[7:53:12] sage40k: inner tessa: o its gunna be pretty nakkiSUBprise
[7:53:30] Chiracho: but now you guys have tier 3 jobs availiable
[7:53:31] jimothy64: Tessa has made 36k without even trying...
[7:53:35] happy_questionmark: it'll be easier to sell a nicer house
[7:53:35] Chiracho: unlike the past weeks
[7:53:40] UmbrellaFox: lmfao this is crazy
[7:53:47] brbdoo: Yeah but that's 400k. We're talking for 1/16th of that for the bench
[7:54:25] JoeayIV: shes gonna make another phonecall
[7:54:26] ChikaB00M_: Tessa a diva
[7:54:30] UmbrellaFox: Smarter, lets park in the red zone OMEGALAUGHING
[7:54:49] vipersummer: ok then no 50k, its simple
[7:54:50] UmbrellaFox: they don't have 66k without you
[7:54:53] PikarRuu: they can have it all
[7:54:56] jimothy64: Yeah let's have our house for illegal activities be where we can't park our vehicles with illegal things in them
[7:55:08] Regodude: ^
[7:55:12] QuesoCommander: let them get the cheapest house to be a computer warehouse and use the rest for a family house
[7:55:22] alphawolfgrave: U alone put 70k
[7:55:33] IosefSerov: They want a warehouse, Tessa wants a home. nakkiShrug
[7:55:36] QuesoCommander: and I mean cheapest anywhere, why not southside for that
[7:55:45] Zubins: if they wanted to go cheapo they should have just gotten a SS house. What kind of strategic reasons are worth the price difference if they're just gonna just use it as a stash house
[7:55:55] jimothy64: I'm just saying, 66k is a huge bargaining chip
[7:56:00] UmbrellaFox: still redzone. still bad backyard
[7:56:05] UmbrellaFox: OMEGALAUGHING
[7:56:14] UmbrellaFox: Clap
[7:56:20] jimothy64: They're talking about using it to store illegal things, and they can't park there
[7:56:38] UmbrellaFox: Tell them you'll buy the house when they're done with it OMEGALAUGHING
[7:56:44] PikarRuu: dont buy a house if they want a wearhouse lol
[7:56:48] Regodude: they could also use the house for private meetings too as more people are populating the meet point at the venetian. I'm hoping they get the one Tess pointed out
[7:56:53] UmbrellaFox: -66k for mustard hous
[7:56:54] HahaNifty: oop
[7:56:54] Jen848: oh my god
[7:57:21] shamma656: aaand tessa out LUL
[7:57:22] jimothy64: Well, pay flop back, it was very specifically loaned so she didn't have to get the bad house. Like, that was the condition of the loan
[7:57:23] shamma656: o7
[7:57:26] Jen848: Nevermind, Flop. Here's your money back.
[7:57:31] HahaNifty: o7
[7:57:36] happy_questionmark: was there a reason for that run?
[7:57:39] TiralusBC: o7
[7:57:45] ColonelCathcart: So rude of them wow LUL
[7:57:46] Zubins: 5 mins later See I paid you back :)
[7:57:53] brbdoo: ziggyjAngy
[7:58:02] UmbrellaFox: so you're only 90% away from buying the house solo
[7:58:04] happy_questionmark: i mean it was pretty awesome
[7:58:33] QuesoCommander: are there any other neighborhoods open? is it just southside, mirror park, and paleto?
[7:58:36] HahaNifty: tessa sticks to her guns
[7:58:41] vipersummer: have to get 100K tessa and eve get 100k and they give her the finger
[7:58:49] retrowolf0498: You have something to do with him anyways
[7:58:52] UmbrellaFox: 66k
[7:58:55] jimothy64: Straight up, 66k has a condition on it, if they can't accept the condition then they don't get the money
[7:59:50] UmbrellaFox: literally not off on it Madge
[7:59:55] UmbrellaFox: just work 1hr
[7:59:58] jimothy64: They can afford it now, and have money to spare
[8:00:04] TrillForest: ima be working g6 forever at this point 😭
[8:00:09] IosefSerov: nakkiJustice
[8:00:09] alphawolfgrave: Can in back up for the house
[8:00:12] QuesoCommander: I think the mistake was calling it a house this whole time
[8:00:32] Steven_b: if they wanted extra for other stuff they should just buy on the south side nakkiSmile
[8:00:34] UmbrellaFox: there is no inbetween Madge
[8:00:54] Zubins: I feel they should have been upfront of it just being a stash house before *anyone* started putting up money for it
[8:01:37] vipersummer: vito is too dense and dumb run a Wendys let alone a mob
[8:02:01] jimothy64: Yeah, they got people 20k in the hole on this, then said "oh it's just storage, you get no input"
[8:02:11] UmbrellaFox: literally the other house
[8:02:17] peachyxist: shxtouCry
[8:02:30] UmbrellaFox: just straight ignoring you Madge
[8:02:37] MajorPorky: this is Blooms old house I think
[8:02:40] IosefSerov: Lol tony
[8:02:54] technomouse666: That was blooms
[8:02:57] JoeayIV: same style at the very least
[8:03:23] jimothy64: Why are they looking at 484 houses when Tessa's is 40k cheaper
[8:03:28] UmbrellaFox: horrrrrrrrrible
[8:03:31] retrowolf0498: I can se parking tickets alore
[8:03:34] HahaNifty: 404k with tax is about 468k
[8:03:45] Zubins: bruh
[8:03:46] JoeayIV: yea
[8:03:48] UmbrellaFox: good thing they're spending 40k less so they don't need your 60k
[8:03:50] jimothy64: Get the house with no access for Tessa's injured days
[8:03:51] UmbrellaFox: OMEGALAUGHING
[8:03:58] nobodybodon: its not that bad
[8:03:58] TrillForest: very basic home
[8:03:58] IosefSerov: It's definitely warehousy
[8:04:03] shamma656: its not living house
[8:04:06] retrowolf0498: They're gonna get so many parking tickets because no one can park normally.
[8:04:09] Chiracho: KEKW
[8:04:12] TrillForest: lmaooo
[8:04:33] HahaNifty: oh its this one KEKW

[8:05:10] free_est: just talk to him in private real quick
[8:05:18] UmbrellaFox: it's literally across the street from the house you want LUL how fucking rude
[8:05:19] nobodybodon: drug alleys are good if you're the one selling the drugs nodd
[8:05:25] jimothy64: It's a dumb compromise. They sold themselves on a MORE expensive house, then the compromise IS Tessa's house
[8:05:28] retrowolf0498: Let them know a psychotic person already has his eyes on this house
[8:06:03] jimothy64: 25k is two people working a day
[8:06:10] TrillForest: Tommy makes BANK at G6 ion mind grinding more for better
[8:06:16] UmbrellaFox: yeah, in debt and not getting what she wants OMEGALAUGHING
[8:06:20] QuesoCommander: southside nodd
[8:06:22] alphawolfgrave: U alone put 70k
[8:06:43] jimothy64: The debt is implicitly tied to the house Tessa was wanting
[8:07:05] Chiracho: sell on value bwo!
[8:07:06] Zubins: I think SS is the most logical if you're trying to be "smart with the money"
[8:07:08] brbdoo: Then get one in SS
[8:07:10] UmbrellaFox: IF NO ONE ELSE CARES THEN LET YOU GET WHAT YOU WANT Madge
[8:07:25] vipersummer: Tessa is bringing in over 80k to this deal, how much is the others complaining about the house she wants?
[8:07:45] KeohLive: @alphawolfgrave I think its actually 86K, 20 from before, 50k loan and the additional 16K she offered before the loan

[8:09:25] IosefSerov: Sadge
[8:09:33] mf298: This is starting to sound like a bad idea with these guys.
[8:09:51] UmbrellaFox: they don't need your money, obviously.  you've already put in 20k too
[8:09:54] vipersummer: when someone is putting in a quarter of the money you have you make them happy
[8:09:54] sage40k: if its just a warehouse why not go somewhere cheaper
[8:10:07] jimothy64: 444 is literally Tessas house
[8:10:10] happy_questionmark: i don't know who it is but one of the guys sounds like bradley cooper to me
[8:10:21] jimothy64: Literally just Carlo
[8:10:24] TrillForest: yellow = mustard
[8:10:39] IosefSerov: Tessa end running the guys...spicy
[8:10:44] jimothy64: Now they're talking about spending the same amount as Tessa's on a poop house
[8:10:52] TrillForest: i agree with tessa here but im not here to defend it in city
[8:11:06] TrillForest: she did put up the most and got a loan so she should have a say
[8:11:57] QuesoCommander: I understand where they're coming from, just don't think the warehouse plan was ever laid out for Tessa until now
[8:12:03] UmbrellaFox: 86k total is what tessa is offering to put in and they want to fight on furniture
[8:12:05] jimothy64: Literally just Carlo shooting it down
[8:12:39] TrillForest: @umbrellafox furniture is easy to make and like they said its a stash house… we got everything we need already

[8:16:39] jimothy64: They were talking about 444 for a mustard house at one point... literally the same price as Tessa's
[8:16:54] UmbrellaFox: OMEGALAUGHING it's not the mustard house
[8:17:04] vipersummer: see they still want the poop
[8:17:08] peachyxist: not the mustard
[8:17:09] jimothy64: Mustard house is not on the table anymore. Tessa's loan is contingent on that
[8:17:25] IosefSerov: Do they understand they might not have the money if they don't buy what Tessa wants?
[8:17:25] UmbrellaFox: tessa's loan should be contingent on the house she wants NODDERS
[8:17:36] Regodude: @jimothy64 with eve's contribution they wouldn't need tessa's 50k
[8:17:39] HahaNifty: welp
[8:17:45] jimothy64: @regodude 66k
[8:17:54] UmbrellaFox: Regodude she's already put in 20k as well
[8:17:56] peachyxist: tessa isnt giving the loan into the mustard house for sure
[8:18:01] Gigglesmctits: Eve has put in 50k already. So she'd put in 100k overall.
[8:18:20] jimothy64: Also, corner house has an alley
[8:19:51] TrillForest: its def bigger
[8:20:48] jimothy64: They really aren't getting that Tessa's house is a) the middle ground and b) the one the loan is contingent on. Nobody else has a preference.
[8:21:00] LissaB: This purchase turned from "a house for the family" to "a warehouse we'll barely be in" real fast
[8:21:17] IosefSerov: If this is just a grow house it should be all about that and it needs to be clear from the start.
[8:21:18] Gigglesmctits: It always was a traphouse essentially. It never was a family house.
[8:21:28] QuesoCommander: nakkiSip
[8:21:40] IosefSerov: nakkiSip
[8:21:50] MinnRia: nakkiSip
[8:21:50] peachyxist: oh man not a family house but a traphouse
[8:21:52] brbdoo: Corner house always seem like a great idea until you have to shovel several ft of snow off two lengths of sidewalk ziggyjHands
[8:21:53] danishzombiex: nakkiPat
[8:21:54] noonsesh: this house is so much nicer..
[8:22:31] jimothy64: They weren't even buying a house today until Tessa brought this up
[8:22:59] IosefSerov: Tessa always standing on the outside of the circle SADGE
[8:23:05] nobodybodon: relax man
[8:23:17] nobodybodon: you've been repeating yourself for 30 minutes
[8:23:24] UmbrellaFox: NODDERS  my bad moon2CUTE
[8:23:27] QuesoCommander: they have plenty of options either way

[8:23:48] 80sHairMetalFan: I'm going on reddit right now
[8:23:48] nobodybodon: the alley stairs is GOATED
[8:23:52] ahealthykidd: @nobodybodon same LUL
[8:23:57] TrillForest: this one is smaller than the one you chose
[8:23:59] JoeayIV: its smaller 100%
[8:24:00] UmbrellaFox: this one isn't horrible but the corner one is just so good
[8:24:01] Chiracho: my only problem with this one is that it looks much smaller than yours
[8:24:03] TrillForest: like WAY smaller
[8:24:06] vipersummer: i feel they were insanely disrespectful right after Tessa put herself in debt for them. thats my only issue
[8:24:08] Steven_b: its a shoe box
[8:24:08] rhonxs: It looks small
[8:24:08] nobodybodon: like, the other to live in, but this one is a way better trap house
[8:24:09] Chiracho: the back alley access is nice though
[8:24:09] jimothy64: It's literally smaller than half the southside houses
[8:24:13] TrillForest: so thats at least a first floor + basement
[8:24:17] PaulisPunk: and no driveway
[8:24:24] nobodybodon: yeah the driveway is lacking
[8:24:25] sage40k: can i be tossic to chat?
[8:24:36] ahealthykidd: size shaming are we
[8:24:41] IosefSerov: I think it's a good warehouse if it specifically doesn't attract attention. nakkiHm
[8:24:44] nobodybodon: @sage40k only to mods and nakkida
[8:24:44] PikarRuu: can the garage in the bottom can be open?
[8:25:14] basssquatch: They were barely gonna have enough for the poop house and then not be able to afford to put things inside.  You come through for a better house and now they wanna use your money for inside stuff.  Frustrating.
[8:25:17] TrillForest: WHO DID THIS BRB SCREEN
[8:25:18] HahaNifty: fingers crossed the tax doesnt drop Prayge
[8:25:19] sage40k: MYAAA BODON SMELLS LIKE SOCKS
[8:25:19] TrillForest: I LOVE IT
[8:25:21] jimothy64: All of Carlo's objections were based on not having enough. Tessa gets enough, Carlo still objects
[8:25:37] 80sHairMetalFan: nakkiCozy
[8:25:39] JoeayIV: *Tessa pulls an additional 50k out of her hat*
[8:25:50] UmbrellaFox: little frustrating that they're ignoring 86k came from tessa alone.  she probably has majority stake in the house
[8:25:51] Jen848: nakkiWaddle
[8:26:04] nobodybodon: @UmbrellaFox eve gave double that
[8:26:05] QuesoCommander: @TrillForest @nakkida made this nakkiSmile
[8:26:15] Makaveli079: before buying a house, can you look the inside first?
[8:26:20] nobodybodon: I think vito said tuesday she had already given 80k
[8:26:22] UmbrellaFox: nobodybodon daaaang
[8:26:22] TrillForest: @nakkida i needa contact you for some design work
[8:26:52] brbdoo: kivaCheer
[8:27:02] happy_questionmark: time to main palworld? Kappa
[8:27:05] QuesoCommander: I'm just saying, Tessa has a rock and poop house has windows
[8:27:06] basssquatch: Just paint signs all over the property saying that it's a storage facility for illegal things
[8:27:08] PikarRuu: have you seen other houses inside ?
[8:27:09] IIIIHELLIIII: LUL mehdiKEK that would send a message

[8:28:05] brbdoo: I went from one spicy situation in the city straight into this one kivaSip
[8:28:20] jimothy64: I just don't understand the push-back. They didn't have enough for any house today. Tessa gets enough so they can, and get the one she wants, and suddenly we're talking about affording furniture? Like, why wasn't that a concern before Tessa made moves
[8:28:26] brbdoo: I'm getting all the rps today

[8:29:34] basssquatch: You could always use your 50k loan to waste on designing everything inside other than what's needed to make money lol
[8:29:58] basssquatch: Agreed
[8:30:06] Jen848: Guess we'll see what happens!
[8:30:07] TooQuick22: that would be spicy
[8:30:11] Kaelath_The_Red: tinyGUNS this is a robbery gimme the 50k
[8:30:11] JoeayIV: buys a car instead and pays back the loan with thats left
[8:30:14] QuesoCommander: turn it into a 10k scooter loan or w/e it costs
[8:30:20] Nanook86: yeah tell them the 50k loan is for the ohter house only
[8:30:24] jimothy64: That's what I'd do. "You want that house, have the 20k I already gave, I'm keeping the rest"
[8:30:38] brbdoo: So would it just be the loan and you still pitch in that 16k
[8:30:48] happy_questionmark: 50k on shoes?
[8:30:59] jimothy64: Nah, the 16k was also part of her up-selling pitch
[8:31:01] basssquatch: Start your own gang
[8:31:05] alphawolfgrave: 50k car
[8:31:07] IosefSerov: That's a lotta shoes...

[8:43:17] brbdoo: Also just being practical: aren't more expensive houses going to take a long time to become available? So treating it as a temp spot seems shortsighted
[8:43:29] happy_questionmark: can we call it the outhouse?
[8:43:31] KeohLive: how did i just notice the wolf shadow on the lamb at the top? mfptBlind
[8:43:34] jimothy64: Yeah, but then they started talking about 484000s too @joeayiv
[8:44:05] UmbrellaFox: how could it be a temp house if no one wants to buy it from them? OMEGALAUGHING they really aren't thinking it through

[8:45:33] stropolopagus: time to draw stink lines on all their ducks
[8:45:42] brbdoo: ^
[8:46:02] Nanook86: yeah tessa called in a big favor and didnt say names  to protect everyuone
[8:46:11] paintingplatypus: But aren't the compromising by getting a different house then poop house?
[8:46:19] paintingplatypus: They*
[8:46:24] UmbrellaFox: OMEGALAUGHING no they're getting another house they want
[8:46:33] UmbrellaFox: a small one
[8:46:34] kiriel09: Tessa needs the lake view for practicing her duck drawings
[8:46:41] kiriel09: it's a business move
[8:46:55] peachyxist: yeah stand your ground and draw the line tessa!
[8:46:58] vipersummer: if not leaving, i think the disrespect is enough to at least pull the loan
[8:46:58] thegrandgeneral3: Vito still around? It seemed like he wanted to talk but the group kept forming up.
[8:47:01] Nanook86: yeah i think the 50k needs strings

[8:47:26] Chiracho: they're awake.
[8:47:27] Zubins: a nicer house will keep resale value better too, later on aesthetics will be more important
[8:47:34] happy_questionmark: tessa's duck dynasty
[8:47:37] Steven_b: its a small as shoe box aswell
[8:47:37] jimothy64: Also the fake compromise. They weren't buying a house today, tessa wants a specific house and makes it happen. There is no other "opinion" to consider. Either you buy Tessa's house, or you don't buy a house today
[8:47:37] UmbrellaFox: in front of a fire hydrant OMEGALAUGHING another towable offence

[8:48:21] ahealthykidd: what about the yellow one next door
[8:48:48] UmbrellaFox: if it was just a warehouse then they would just move to paleto or something
[8:48:55] IosefSerov: The disrespect crocc2Capeesh
[8:48:59] jimothy64: "Gotta make everyone happy" but everyone else doesn't care.. so they're just choosing to make Tessa unhappy.
[8:49:05] Steven_b: a warehouse is the southside pretty much
[8:49:05] phzephyr0: Its too expensive
[8:49:11] nobodybodon: KEKW
[8:49:13] Nanook86: yeah a warehouse or factory house should be cheap

[8:50:54] Zubins: especially you KNOW who your neighbors are now before even moving in. Who knows who your neighbors will be in mirror park in the future
[8:50:58] jimothy64: Also yeah, even if it's just a storage spot, it's way bigger...
[8:51:10] UmbrellaFox: NODDERS stand your ground tessa

[8:53:10] UmbrellaFox: OMEGALAUGHING back at the dirt lawn house
[8:53:13] Aislingmor: I could be wrong, but I feel like Tessa is looking for a home, especially since the loss of her dad. Not to mention that she's not real crime oriented and that's all the others want the house for. I can see where Tessa would feel hurt
[8:53:20] retrowolf0498: Didn't you also want to get your apartment set up for the op with Tiny?
