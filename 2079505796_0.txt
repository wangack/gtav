[2:14:43] equilateral: I just doubt I'll ever do it
[2:14:48] NaisRikard: I would say well Sweden/Norway/Finland are nice if you go to the north in winter months to get the proper northern lights experience since I have had several people visit me and the expression they have is out of this world since it is something most of the world does not experience
[2:14:56] bruHoran: imo Portugal is super underated as a tourist destination
[2:15:00] Kwni: never been on a plane but have seen most of Europe

[2:38:36] TimmayHS: I don't think he communicated that point very well.

[2:40:01] nikolegrnd: NODDERS
[2:40:08] Chritters: oop
[2:40:16] TimmayHS: The best way they could have gone about the HC panel, is include ALL seniors across all shifts. Even if they can't make it, they get a vote and can review all his DAPs
[2:40:20] MAZM0L: army spawns not being removed classic
[2:40:40] Crazith: needs a repair and a lock pick
[2:40:44] Riqui__: That was the smartest thing iver heard about the dap system so far
[2:41:35] GDaddyCheech: Cornwood is the soft version of pred lol
[2:41:44] TimmayHS: losing a cop like Cornwood is a bigger hit to morale than losing a captain like Ruth imo
[2:42:13] randybobndyphone: Shoulda had a chain of command day one
[2:42:16] GDaddyCheech: @timmayhs strongly agree
[2:42:33] casualgeekygirl: A fire was lit under them
[2:42:34] Evilzanz: oh they def cleaning house
[2:42:35] TimmayHS: 2 months ago HC was meeting and arguing about petty shit like dapping for wearing a hat or whatever
[2:42:37] allyliciousx: has Ruth gone yet @timmayhs
[2:43:11] TimmayHS: @allyliciousx well she suspended herself and appointed her protégé Aldo to be interim Captain
[2:43:26] Dagarul: Ruth isnt going anywhere tbh
[2:43:36] allyliciousx: oh. Ty for the update
[2:43:40] wesfeye: gloves are nikkisCringe
[2:43:49] ingridktravels: @GDaddyCheech Pred was far more knowledgeable than Cornwood

[2:44:24] GDaddyCheech: @ingridktravels that's your opinion 🍻
[2:44:26] kingshwing: @ingridktravels Cornwood is a hell of lot easier to work with than  Pred
[2:44:37] TimmayHS: I was confused when I read that Malton doesn't think the DAP system is a problem at all.
[2:45:04] TimmayHS: yea that makes sense.. and the lack of consistency
[2:45:12] Dagarul: the 60 day thing was a issue but thats been fixed now right?
[2:45:27] TimmayHS: the best solution I heard was Ruby's idea.. 15/30/45
[2:45:52] casualgeekygirl: Cornwood also constantly brings up how pd was years ago. I get thats his reference of knowledge tho
[2:45:55] TimmayHS: and on top of that, have alternatives to daps like community service and ways to remove a dap that doesn't suck up time from chain of command
[2:46:35] TimmayHS: like, lets say you work 8 hours standing inside Senior Buns, and that removes a dap
[2:46:56] MAZM0L: Time to get some secret spots
[2:47:00] GDaddyCheech: I love nopixel rp and fact is cornwood provides rp to others more than most people in the city
[2:47:14] ImMcGuirk: Inb4 it's just a picture of mac roof running
[2:47:18] Dagarul: community service = target on their back.. just being on duty for certain amount of hours = 1 dap removed is better

[2:47:41] 0Laetitia0: or better, Nick KEKW
[2:47:53] TimmayHS: @Dagarul that's fair, but also there's a need to have a presence in those places like Snr Buns that cops dread being around
[2:47:54] SwagnificentTG: @TimmayHS the problem with that is that when there's 10 officers on duty having 10% of your force not on patrol is not sustainable
[2:48:41] Dagarul: @TimmayHS its why they need to open for food places.. idk why that hasnt been brought up yet.. unless its a thing on the dev side
[2:48:42] TimmayHS: @SwagnificentTG well sure, and of course maybe they get called off of that community service if needed, but I think it's better than those officers getting fired and then you're down an officer altogether
