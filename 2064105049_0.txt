[2:03:41] illuminat4242: @illuminat4242 the point of Lawyers is to see charges either taken or dismissed.  And how many people have been in the jail here and they are like time served we bill you then walk you out.   What is the point of having time in prison on any of the Jail if they are just going to reduce it.  If they aren't facing the full punishment then why not just take their money and be done with it like they have done with a lot of the crims.

[3:54:27] BigglesVII: You miss rp opportunities if you put them straight into a car.
[3:54:51] 22vert: 22vert subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! Aint no way
[3:55:05] Cultivated: @MsHollyyy Ya they wouldn't of even tried that if he was in the cop car cause then they'd know they have no chance leaving outside literally gave them a reason to try.
[3:55:36] hvanity: This scene was a mess. Not sure what copium he's on
[3:55:49] focustft: @Cultivated That's the point. They don't want to end the RP immediately by putting him in the car
[3:56:23] Cultivated: @focustft I do agree with that it did create a lot more rp
