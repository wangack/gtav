[0:30:05] PeachTwirl: “just like the boys in my book”- from booktok
[0:30:10] StarWindex: I think my favorite is the guys who think that as soon as they get a gf or a wife, they will do nothing but be a house wife. Like she can have a life too?
[0:30:22] Tyler4AM: That's actually what I lead with on Tinder, "I promise I won't kill you even though I could". Definitely works like a charm NODDERS
[0:30:22] Luroloro: i watched a document about people who have a thing for serial killers and their aesthetic. wild stuff

[0:31:19] opalducky: I think they are called hybristophilliacs ?
[0:31:43] Tyler4AM: There's nothing wrong with being a stay at home mom. But a guy having the expectation that a woman has to be one and then it being a deal breaker when she's not is insane
[0:32:31] Spartman008: it all comes back to communication
[0:32:33] Luroloro: Im a stay at home dad, built to infuriate guys like that
[0:32:43] Spartman008: thats all not hard just talk to each other
[0:32:57] Tyler4AM: Yeah that's what I'm talking about lol, guys who think it's the female norm to do that

[0:34:50] inus2: was thinking au pair but that's usually a younger person taking care of them
[0:34:53] Okamaui: i love how the way of thinking in men from old views to now literally goes from "Oonga boonga, man go work and woman stay home and keep home nice" to "I want a corporate mommy to take care of me and beat my ass and step on me"
[0:35:09] imdeatht1: You thinking Au pair?
[0:35:47] Spartman008: but women where always out hunting with everyone else as well.
[0:36:05] opalducky: Woman actually were expected to run the house books and finances
[0:36:05] ItzhakSkenstrom: Staff to manage the staff.

[0:51:01] imdeatht1: Gotta take Sunshine to the job for good luck
[0:51:29] Tyler4AM: I went on a trip with my friend this past Sunday and have a specific question for everyone: What is the appropriate amount of time you can take to think about what you wanna order from a fast food place after telling the person at the speaker "I'm gonna need a minute"
[0:51:39] Tyler4AM: Because we went to cookout and since it was his first time going there, my friend asked to give him a minute. He took like 45 seconds and the guy working the counter got pissed at him because he apparently took too long
[0:52:27] ellesmaria: @Tyler4AM my anxiety makes my brain say 0 seconds but really I think you can have a few minutes if you're a normal person rofl
[0:52:30] imdeatht1: depends if its packed or not. if its not packed its fine
[0:52:41] TKE_Super_Dave: I think it depends on how backed up the line is and how long you've had to look at the menu
[0:52:49] Vizi797: I frantically read the menu while in line to decide beforehand, because holding up the line is terrifying kivaLUL
[0:52:53] Tyler4AM: There was one car behind us but that's it. He legit gave us our food, closed the window and then ignored us when we tried to ask for sauce lol
[0:53:39] Tyler4AM: Also the only reason we went is because we didn't realize the lane we were in was a left turn only so it was very "Fuck it we're going" lol, didn't have time to look up the menu beforehand
[0:53:46] Thrath: kivaNotes
[0:54:03] ellesmaria: @Vizi797 i've actually pulled over into a parking lot to look up the menu online before hopping into line before XD even with no one in line lol

[0:55:11] Vizi797: I've definitely done similar KEKW @ellesmaria

[0:56:33] Spartman008: need a notepad file
[0:56:43] Tyler4AM: I'll look up a menu if I'm ordering a takeout from like a sit down restaurant, but if it's fast food I'm good with just looking at the menu and seeing what they have

[1:07:58] Vizi797: I think since they're "keys" for some reason I never thought you could actually use them as weapons still until then kivaLUL
[1:08:43] uitzui: bonus points if its someone who is really mad at Reed
[1:09:03] Tyler4AM: aka half the city given how often he robs people lol
[1:09:37] Vizi797: It might be a way to score browny sewer points if people are still mad at him down here. Just telling everyong "I beat down Reed earlier" lol

[1:12:32] uitzui: nobody even did anything with the below average shine
[1:12:46] uitzui: yeah sewer life seems very friendly and chill
[1:13:20] Vizi797: Putting off the shortest path to the center was probably a good call too. Probably avoids any of the visitors who might be less friendly than the sewer peeps
[1:15:11] Vizi797: or away from was probably the better way to put that
[1:15:42] uitzui: its a really convenient spot NODDERS with a pretty good exit as well

[1:21:26] uitzui: Nana would do it, Nana does anything and everything kivaLUL
[1:22:06] Vizi797: NODDERS Nana would one arm carry all 368 crates out of the sewers at once and run it all immediately
[1:22:09] uitzui: yeah, i just like the way she always says "i can do iT"
[1:23:49] Tyler4AM: Why didn't the Beach Boys ever sing about how sick Delfino was
[1:23:55] Tyler4AM: Instead of stupid Kokomo
[1:24:04] EddieEXP: kivaTooth
[1:24:09] Madam_Orange: well you know her name now if she does Kappa
[1:24:22] wizardiis: kivaTooth
[1:24:29] uitzui: kivaTooth
[1:24:29] Anrisacia: But what if, hear me out, Andi gets put on an investigative hold for mooonshine. then all the Mario Sunshine time! KEKW
[1:24:35] Tyler4AM: I'm not 100% certain Lily wasn't also Reed in disguise tbh
[1:24:47] Madam_Orange: kivaSus
[1:25:19] uitzui: steal a huge truck, load it up with 600 crates of moonshine and use it for a block during the laundromat
[1:25:24] uitzui: and get caught in it
[1:25:49] Tyler4AM: Call Slacks rn and tell him "Hey pussy I got so much moonshine down here, bet you can't catch me"
[1:25:54] Steambottom: so many stills
[1:26:09] Vizi797: What if.. for +1 Hardcore hour Andi goes and buys a switch, and just plays Mario Sunshine in the sewers inbetween cooks kivaSus
[1:27:06] Madam_Orange: lol vizi
[1:28:45] Okamaui: omgim so used to the sped up tiktok version of this song
[1:29:13] uitzui: i think you could do the hack for the usb
[1:29:25] Tyler4AM: I don't wanna over-exaggerate but I think tiktok has ruined music
[1:29:25] uitzui: especially because Erin said it's unlimited tries i think
[1:29:46] Vizi797: You've only seen it like twice though kivaLUL
[1:29:57] Tyler4AM: It's all Taylor Swift's fault
[1:29:58] Tyler4AM: Again
[1:30:06] uitzui: yeah and you have become way better at the wifi hack which is arguably harder since it's letters and numbers
[1:30:11] uitzui: chop is only letters
[1:30:20] Anrisacia: kivaTooth
[1:30:44] Barcca: kivaTooth
[1:30:58] uitzui: NODDERS
[1:31:01] Tyler4AM: I'm mostly kidding but I do think more songs nowadays are being made specifically for tiktok, and nothing else
[1:31:42] uitzui: just make it viral mkay kivaNotes
[1:34:40] Thrath: NODDERS
[1:34:41] CautiousDani: trying to think of songs singers hate of their own haha
[1:34:48] Vizi797: NODDERS
[1:35:10] uitzui: yeah need part time helpers to be part time cooks
[1:35:18] opalducky: Dani I can name quite a few kivaLUL
[1:35:38] Tyler4AM: @CautiousDani Radiohead hated Creep because of how much outreach they got from weirdos saying they related to the song
[1:36:07] MrHyde81: @CautiousDani Bobby McFerrin hates 'Don't Worry Be Happy'
[1:36:20] Vizi797: I know this specifically is for the house, but Andi's got a pretty great money making asset with her recipe now for herself if you wanted NODDERS
[1:36:56] opalducky: Doja hates Say so because of how often she was invited to sing the song over and over again
[1:37:03] uitzui: or even just casually cook a bit and be kinda fine on money
[1:37:13] Vinkari: People would probably buy the crates because it's good recipe
[1:37:47] uitzui: that as well yeah, Dundees offer was exactly that
[1:38:01] Madam_Orange: there was the phone number offering like $500 a crate
[1:38:14] uitzui: ye kivaLUL
[1:38:35] uitzui: yeah that is fair but if you do a test sale of 10 crates not much would be lost
[1:38:40] StarWindex: That is the issue, trusting him kivaLUL
[1:38:41] Vinkari: Some smaller crews like Raiders might buy too
[1:38:42] Tyler4AM: Dundee would NEVER double cross someone
[1:38:43] Tyler4AM: Shorely
[1:38:45] uitzui: and maybe he does want for things to be differnt this time around
[1:38:46] Madam_Orange: think he started negatiating with rod too, offered like 550 at some point
[1:38:52] Vizi797: Dundee having money in the first place to buy the crates is suspicious on it's own KEKW
[1:38:54] Madam_Orange: so you could prob get more
[1:39:05] uitzui: it is still Dundee but having good deals with chaotic people is helpful in its own
[1:39:07] MrHyde81: @Vizi797 True
[1:39:14] wizardiis: KEKW

[1:44:56] wizardiis: kivaLUL
[1:45:06] opalducky: Just an Asexual Dan kivaLUL
[1:45:10] Tyler4AM: Surprised nobody made a Cris Cringle Dan for Christmas time
[1:45:19] thatguymike03: "maam/sir i am not interested in you!!" lol
[1:45:25] Vizi797: That is a good one KEKW
[1:45:49] Tyler4AM: Hey don't talk like that, I'm sure your shoulder is plenty smart NODDERS
[1:46:14] uitzui: because it knows how to NODDERS
[1:46:58] wizardiis: kivaNOOO

[1:47:03] Vizi797: kivaSad
[1:47:15] opalducky: I really wish someone to make Single Dan now kivaSad
[1:47:35] uitzui: i'd imagine Stanley alternates between Sani and shine
[1:49:22] Vizi797: It just clicked in my head, did Rod just say a minute ago he only lost like 5 rep from being up top all day yesterday? kivaSus
[1:49:35] Tyler4AM: Ok but real talk tho tiny horses suck
[1:49:40] Tyler4AM: Just get bigger wtf
[1:49:50] opalducky: Roan is a a horse so
[1:49:56] uitzui: yeah i figured the rep loss cant be bad since Rod is on the surface quite a bit and still stays maxed out
[1:49:57] Jerco2020: Rod absorbed vitamin D kivaNOOO
[1:49:58] opalducky: Also
[1:51:41] lblvckmvgicl: banana427TODADO

[1:53:42] Tyler4AM: Plot twist, Jesus Christ is also a tiny horse in this song
[1:54:06] Vizi797: I love that Nana both speaks and texts in caps 100% of the time kivaLUL
[1:54:18] opalducky: This song is a acid trip kivaLUL
[1:55:44] Tyler4AM: There is nothing cute about being pigeon toed
[1:55:45] Madam_Orange: nana is such a good vibes addition to the group peepoHappy
[1:55:46] Tyler4AM: As someone who is
[1:58:21] Tyler4AM: Whenever you mention salads I just think of the ep of Parks and Rec where Chris tries to serve Ron a salad
[1:58:29] Tyler4AM: and he's like "Do I look like a rabbit to you"

[2:06:25] Steambottom: any idea how diff your recipe is from others?
[2:06:41] Vizi797: I'm kinda curious if there being 10 slots in the still is telling that the mechanic will expand later on, or if it's just how the UI works and they didn't make a specific 4 slot one for the still
[2:07:31] uitzui: he has qL !!!
[2:10:07] uitzui: they might just had it in the form to have people experiment more in the beginning vizi
[2:10:24] uitzui: because i remember on the first days people tried all sorts of stuff
[2:10:56] Vizi797: That's true, I forgot there wasn't a "hey there's to much stuff in here" error at the very beginning was there.

[2:41:19] ScarletThePaladin: that could go so wrong so yes..
[2:45:34] uitzui: i think in a way that is a good approach to heists, since the drivers need to best judge if something is doable

[10:26:19] Vizi797: It's been fairly good for the most part NODDERS
[10:26:35] Thrath: Just need the other cook or another gatherer and will be back in full motion
[10:26:35] uitzui: yeah and who knows, maybe if she tells him his main shift has to be on the weekend to keep production up
[10:27:58] Anrisacia: Yeah if Rod is down there, it's double the materials and half the stills you each have to fill. Easy upkeep at that point NODDERS
[10:28:28] Anrisacia: Instead there's 10 stills sitting empty right now Sadge

[10:36:20] Anrisacia: Not that I think it would be the type of cop character you would play, but I always kind of wondered what kind of detective cop you could be with your attention to detail and organization skills
[10:37:07] Madam_Orange: detective stuff is my favorite cop rp to watch but it’s more rare
[10:37:39] uitzui: it's more rare and always questionable how much it is even doable depending on server state
