[6:30:55] ShaggyGamerDude: Due to how tattoos were used in the 20th century, they are often associated with criminality. Many gangs and criminal organizations mark members with tattoos, including visible areas such as the face, head, and neck. Members may get facial tattoos as a form of intimidation. This started in California in the 1980s before becoming widespread.
