[0:56:16] jimothy64: Like, something along the lines of "remaining as a passenger in an evading vehicle despite opportunities to vacate".... BUT then that's not really resisting its being party to the Evading.. so it shouldn't be on that charge at all

[1:24:10] QuesoCommander: should payout to 1st, 2nd, and 3rd and offer a bonus prize if someone can land all three
[1:24:50] jimothy64: So with Siobhan saying its intentionally written that way, sounds like maybe Adams or Crane needs to look at the resisting "loophole"..

[1:26:26] nobodybodon: I still think its silly, how often does it happen that a car pulls up RIGHT next to a person who is being arrested and they get in before being tazed, cuffed, or fleeing on foot?

[1:32:03] CatGotYourKeyboard: nakkiKEKS
[1:32:13] retrowolf0498: That's probably because it was copied from the YouTube comments of a Buzzfeed video.
[1:32:23] jimothy64: Tessa gonna become a judge, fix all the charges that bother her, then quit. Like that story of the guy who got hired to fix a bug that annoyed him then immediately quit
[1:33:06] retrowolf0498: Yea. That's a funny story because nobody could figure out how to fix the bug.

[1:40:56] IosefSerov: HLARPING
[1:42:28] Zietha: For more wierd sport from Finland you need to add wife carrying
[1:43:02] jimothy64: Surprised K isn't all over trying to game this lol.. owning horses and making people run them seems right up his alley
[1:43:02] IosefSerov: Juno would marry Tessa just to do that
[1:43:15] retrowolf0498: @zietha that sounds like something that would happen in the southern half of the US.
[1:43:18] dinoroaria: hiHelloHi:)
[1:44:46] dinoroaria: oooh, tat explains a bit.
[1:45:00] nobodybodon: ReallyMad you mean the studio set they pretended was the moon
[1:45:14] jimothy64: Wrong colour for the moon flag, the one on the moon is bleached white now
[1:45:15] nobodybodon: WHICH WAS ON THEIR SECRET MARS BASE! DONT BELIEVE THE GOVERNMENTS LIES!
[1:45:27] Chiracho: that flag on the moon is 100% bleached white by now
[1:45:47] retrowolf0498: The building is cursed
[1:46:10] jimothy64: @chiracho hey that's my factoid :P
[1:46:14] IosefSerov: Probably from backing out
[1:46:21] Chiracho: @jimothy64 yoink
[1:46:24] Chiracho: lol
[1:46:29] nys006: @Chiracho do you think thats why aliens dont invade us? cause they alwasy think we're surrendering
[1:46:48] Chiracho: KEKW
[1:46:54] jimothy64: The follow-up joke is that this means the moon is officially a French claim
[1:47:17] macman385: @nys006 that could also be a sign for war like in mars attacks
[1:47:46] nys006: nakkiSuspect damn maybe we're sending mix signals
[1:48:06] retrowolf0498: @jimothy64 I really hate that joke because of how it started.
[1:48:15] JoeayIV: just like the start of 3.0
[1:48:19] Anrield: anrielCupid
[1:48:19] JoeayIV: every spot filled
[1:48:37] JoeayIV: a turbo would fix that
[1:48:54] jimothy64: To be fair, the whole "France surrenders" thing is entirely baseless. They're actually the country that has won the most wars
[1:49:33] retrowolf0498: Yea. They're the most blood thirsty country in the world.
[1:49:47] macman385: not to mention the world would be very different if napoleon didnt invade russia
[1:50:09] kebabburken: hahah why are u not driving xD
[1:50:26] retrowolf0498: Or if France didn't pull 75% of it forces from the German border

[2:06:26] ApocAFK: It's more jank for sure, but I feel like once you learn it, you can probably be more precise
[2:06:35] Jen848: nakkiHappyClap

[2:07:22] jimothy64: Clearly toilets are gonna cost 9k alone :P

[2:10:50] Brumorin: sounds like something kirk would do
[2:10:56] OrestesTheSloth: For those that want a trailer home inside their home
[2:11:00] Chiracho: unless they plan to be able to place outside i don;t see anyone using that inside.

[2:56:38] nobodybodon: or that
[2:56:44] jimothy64: Lottie rocks up to sell her ice cream at the event, implies they make you faster, makes bank
[2:56:51] nobodybodon: but a 50% markup is still like, no money
[2:57:11] JoeayIV: "horse racing fuel"
[2:57:19] jimothy64: Ever bought concessions at a stadium? 50% markup is nothing
[2:57:25] JoeayIV: 25$ is 25$ Bpdpm
[2:57:33] JoeayIV: wow i fucked that one up
[2:57:42] nobodybodon: You can't just say it though, you have to go "*cough* yknow, it'll give you 'energy' for the race *cough cough*"
[2:57:52] nobodybodon: REALLY make them think you're talking OOC buffs
[2:57:55] retrowolf0498: It could also be that boosts aren't active yet due to certain drugs not being available right now.
[2:58:30] JoeayIV: also you ask Lottie who bought drinks before hand and regardless if they speed up or not you fudge the odds
[2:58:35] JoeayIV: really fuck with em

[4:09:08] nobodybodon: you never had grilled pineapple?
[4:09:46] jimothy64: Doesn't seem like something I'd enjoy buy also doesn't sound entirely unusual
[4:10:33] retrowolf0498: I'm not a fan of pineapple period. It makes me feel sick.

[4:12:41] ApocAFK: Our family usually has at least 3
[4:12:44] nobodybodon: theres a HUGE difference between glazed ham and pineapple and meatballs. one is literally syrup on meat, the other is closer to orange chicken (except thats also syrup, but you get my point, its tangy and amazing too)
[4:12:48] ApocAFK: Because everyone wants to make their own
[4:13:07] ApocAFK: So we end up with a tradional one, a smoked one, and a fried one
[4:14:58] JoeayIV: how could Brenda do this

[5:59:01] mgFray: hashbrowns
[5:59:53] MinnRia: to ingridktravels nakkiLove
[6:00:10] Chiracho: @Nakkida ^
[6:00:26] retrowolf0498: I got Taco Bell because an open til 2 location opened in my small town two weeks ago.
[6:00:47] 80sHairMetalFan: You're playing with fire with Taco Bell.
[6:01:42] retrowolf0498: It's better than the McDonald's in my town. I'd rather drive 30 minutes to go to a different one than the one in my town.
[6:03:10] jimothy64: I think, unless I'm missing anyone, 7 of the ex rangers found their way into the new PD.. pretty solid
[6:03:54] retrowolf0498: I can name 5. I don't think I've seen the other 2 yet.
[6:04:44] jimothy64: Avery, Maple, Flop, Tips, Lovesick, Louise, Johnson*
[6:05:08] retrowolf0498: Ah. I haven't seen Lovesick or Louise in uniform yet.
[6:05:35] jimothy64: Lovesick was just at G6, Louise ran into Tessa at Snr Buns on day 1
[6:06:00] Chiracho: KEKW poor jay catching strays when he's not even there
[6:06:23] sanzonw: calling him out for the blacklist was perfect, so funny
[6:09:15] retrowolf0498: @jimothy64 I didn't think he was in pd uniform but then again I wasn't really paying attention. More focused on getting food in from the car
[6:09:16] jimothy64: Just saying, setting up the website the night after the computer was installed in the house? Best +1 whether intentional or not
[6:10:18] jimothy64: Installed the PC, set up Butcoin mining, made her own website
