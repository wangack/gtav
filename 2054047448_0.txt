[4:21:53] HotCocoaGamer: I mean the way I see it. Is that Mary never wanted K caught and raided. So this can be just a "apology" for that aspect.
[4:21:54] a_ou1: how much money does mary have ?
[4:21:58] czhilli: CG lost more than that in the conflict anyway
[4:22:06] f4p__l0rd: It not about 20k it about bending the knee when winning

[4:28:53] ReverSpace: its a big enough win for him to save face
[4:28:56] SpectreUK: and with none of KC and Guild havent been touched its just the innocent employees getting hurt
[4:28:56] Nightbot: Please don't backseat game, let the Roleplay happen naturally. Telling Kylie what to do will result in a timeout. notveryowo
[4:28:57] ELTanqu3: @kyliebitkin ALSO lets say if Mr K does brag all Mary has to say is that the goons did al the work not CG OMEGALUL

[8:24:52] eborcurean: Ohh, Kylie, I missed clipping it, but for no apparent reason JJ was asking Jane Winters about being NA PNT for Kaneshiro, no resaon at all.

[8:25:54] ThePitfallover: just, by some insane stroke of luck, no one from KC got picked up KEKW
[8:25:56] eborcurean: then tell them she paid 20k to protet them and they'll be even more loyal
[8:25:57] SirRagnas: Dundee and Co are just yellow chevrons in Cyberpunk.

[8:28:34] eborcurean: selling and repairing now can be 25k a day
[8:28:34] rmcgowan: Selling parts pays well now
[8:28:36] prozorftw: the clean stuff sounded interesting
[8:28:36] Morningstarter: you would need to put the phone away to get to grind
[8:28:37] SenorTaavi: Repairing shit is worth even more now
[8:28:37] SpectreUK: as long as you get some repairs in
[8:28:38] KewlKittyProductions: and sales
[8:28:42] tedium7: nodd
[8:28:43] RoyLeeTV: you could grind then own the atm
[8:28:45] moe_uwu: If you actually worked there on Mary then you would make full profit on Mary
[8:28:48] Morningstarter: the amount of phonecalls you get are huge
[8:28:48] Snup78: angel couldgive driving lesson for good money
[8:28:48] Isen_Mage: need to take some repairs yourself not just hand them all off nodd
[8:28:49] Stoney_Mahoney: I feel like the big money will come with weed anyway
[8:28:49] Fr0stwav3: KEKW you were talking about how standing there is making you go crazy
[8:28:50] eborcurean: it's just the 6 hours in the basement that sucks
[8:28:50] dume5330: just hard to tell how much you are making as the group account
[8:28:57] rmcgowan: And if you get 1-2 more benches, the parts making will be even less painful
[8:29:01] PsychoBKilla: True Mary gets pulled in a lot of directions
[8:29:02] SenorTaavi: Side quests INSANECAT
[8:29:02] moe_uwu: You also give away almost every repair atm
[8:29:05] Sonaro8: mosleys is good for networking as well so if you total everything you get back from it its great
[8:29:07] Qulnir: with new increased prices crafting is better profit as well
[8:29:07] ELTanqu3: You also stand for 10 mins and want to leave right after KEKW
[8:29:07] RoyLeeTV: you could control the ATM
[8:29:10] treeshark: doing stuff outside of mosleys also lets u hang with KC more when there around
[8:29:11] FIunkifer: mary can go max 5 minutes without getting a phone call
[8:29:11] captaincameron: less talky more grindy
[8:29:14] zippybln2: cluu
[8:29:19] SpectreUK: Could get 1 more bench to lessen the crafting time
[8:29:25] zachps: Does it make sense to get another bench rn?
[8:29:28] ProjectStephen: I love that Angel still has the cone KEKW
[8:29:33] eborcurean: also that's why mosleys employees are so loyal, they know she could do it. banking more rep

[8:33:40] MJ77seven: some lockpicks here and there
[8:33:42] TheZYgnar: its because he doesnt want people to know about Adam
[8:33:44] Sonaro8: its the potential for later because mary is gonna make money, it cant be helped
[8:33:46] Vadoctrax: Mary is priceless
[8:33:46] zachps: He doesnt have much of a choice he is forced to be leader
[8:33:47] Fragger__23: well you help everyone in the guild.
[8:33:47] eborcurean: Yaeger being total rotet for Mary is great, it's like he sees her as an equal in a way he doesn't to others

[8:33:51] PatrickMaybe: he's in it for the long term, he'll be asking when shes a millionaire PepeLaugh
[8:33:55] Isen_Mage: Mary's the merchant, better to let the merchant reinvest the profits now for gains later
[8:33:56] adq_4: How could he not? They salute Yeager and decided to follow him
[8:34:00] ThePitfallover: and hurting it as it's getting started only slows it down
[8:34:01] jerabet: Viggy is just on his WoW prep.
[8:34:01] rmcgowan: I think he's thinking more of the long game. He's not seeing what Mary is making now, but thinking more about what she will be doing in a year
[8:34:04] moe_uwu: he needs a fake reason so he doesn't have to admit to others he actually cares just because of "family""
[8:34:05] captaincameron: maybe he sees Mary as the one that will guide them to the money
[8:34:09] footmunched: I mean, compared to the rest of the Guilld, you are a goldmine

[9:19:38] SirRagnas: I feel like this verdict will be pro or against clean person status lol
[9:19:40] d00b3rr: 2 under oath statements by the defense witnesses said she was there and an active participant. and she only really claimed she didnt recall the day very clearly
[9:19:41] eborcurean: yeah w/o them it's definite reasonable doubt, but they were the witnesses
[9:19:43] footmunched: I mean, that's 3 witnesses.
[9:19:43] Isen_Mage: they said she did it, kinda hard to come back when her own side is saying it Shrug
[9:19:44] Sonaro8: comes down to what they can prove tho
[9:19:50] vividimaginations: Live by the clown die by the clown.
[9:19:51] alexandra_littlefox: Thay both tied her to the place and time sooo
[9:20:11] VanillaChill: they threw her under the bus, not much you can really do tbh KEKW
[9:20:12] Tronno: Chatterbox said she threw a wrench and missed, but it was her idea kyliebLul
[9:20:30] eborcurean: defence witnesses testifying against the defendant have a high weight, moreso than a cop saying 'i saw it'
[9:20:39] SwagnificentTG: Without Twinkles and Chatterbox I think she might have been fine KEKW
[9:20:46] SirRagnas: I mean the entire defense self snitched lol
[9:20:47] RandomDCLXVI: was she procesed as guilty?
[9:20:56] Syncrostrike: Maple probably has better DOJ rep. than someone like Den. Is there any reason not to believe his identification skills?
[9:21:07] PsychoBKilla: o7
[9:21:13] eborcurean: defence should have motioned to discard, albeit thats a struggle as it's their witness
[9:21:14] footmunched: There's just no wiggle room, really
[9:21:17] Isen_Mage: guess she's guilty then o7
[9:21:20] mobius__0ne1: o7
[9:21:21] alexandra_littlefox: Nope. You eat what you make
[9:21:25] ibruticus: o7
[9:21:26] VanillaChill: Clowns know what they were doing, they had to of KEKW
[9:21:27] AetherMana: NGL i thought you were going to gavel back to back after a clown was going to throw
[9:21:29] tigerland06: did she give a defense other than I didn't do it? Anything plausible? The lawyer didn't help there much.
