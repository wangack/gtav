[1:16:29] bradthgamer: newer consoles now run at 60fps
[1:16:41] DKDKDK_Official: But yeah it's not an option that you can just toggle.
[1:16:59] arnav_pundale: i love consoles (especially ps5)
[1:17:14] calebsuss: You get used to the frame drops. and I love controller ❤️

[1:17:56] DjTust: Ps4 frames are WAY worse
[1:18:08] DKDKDK_Official: Raytracing on PC. (Only with mods, but that's not like it..)
[1:18:11] arnav_pundale: @BrentButler Yeah, and they are better
[1:18:12] bradthgamer: controller just feels slow
[1:18:12] MrSmooth360: game doesn't look bad on console now though at least
[1:18:14] mrphoenix10: @Cold_War_Goat yeah when i tried to play it last time i just got killed so bad ( its is mainly becuz i suck but still the game isnt that good). also the game doesnt have a skill matched matchmaking which is really bad for people that is trying to get in.

[1:27:20] DKDKDK_Official: Maybe people just got pcs or better pcs and started to play with it? dviperWave
[1:27:29] joshuabzz: how much of that is gta rp
[1:27:33] notknightfox: Hi!

[1:28:14] arnav_pundale: five em is the only thing keeping gta o alive?
[1:28:19] lazyszechuan: is rdo anywhere to close to gtao
[1:28:24] turtlesfly_ihnc: FiveM and other GTA RP things use the files from GTA V but don't launch through it so I doubt they have an effect

[1:28:49] arnav_pundale: i didnt mean the question mark
[1:28:50] DKDKDK_Official: If you launch FiveM that doesn't launch GTA_V on steam. It uses something on steam, but that's not releated to anything from R*.
[1:28:58] calebsuss: @arnav_pundale ridiculous take
[1:29:05] bradthgamer: @lazyszechuan rdo died before it could make an impact

[1:32:50] fevo0: Who is this young looking 25 year old man? LUL I had to laugh so hard about that part of the ramble
[1:32:55] trims3: The fact you basically said this about rdr2 aswell
[1:33:02] vvlutador: I dont think 20k is not enough to make a game
[1:33:06] DKDKDK_Official: R* bought FiveM WutFace ??

[1:34:23] d2pox: harsh but somewhat true
[1:34:28] eggohelpdesk: what game are you playing today

[1:35:04] Azray90: Why
[1:35:48] Awselot: that painting on the wall there is so pretty tho wth ive never noticed that
[1:35:51] xd_killtense1: HEY MATTO I LOVE THE VIDS BRO KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK
[1:35:52] ernestcmh: this is a perfect example of a game which is duck-taped together
[1:35:59] Takkie79: stil is
[1:36:01] cattogun97: No more
[1:36:06] larbitn: if they make servers they it will fix a hell lot of problems
[1:36:17] imgoodwithusernames: Sometimes
[1:36:17] xd_killtense1: HIII MATTO
[1:36:20] rainhopp: Hey Matt, do you think GTA 6 is gonna have a form of multiplayer just built into it?
[1:36:24] AmbiguousAlx: 50/50
[1:36:25] francskgp: looking forward to how session loading/switching will work in gta 6
[1:36:26] MrSmooth360: couldn't tell you
[1:36:28] Azray90: But unless u play roleplay, what's the point of open sessions
[1:36:38] trims3: Maybe old/new mission thing?
[1:36:56] stevemiller22: dviperBongo
[1:36:58] Maxey_sauce: I'm constantly losing connection to sessions with no explanation at all and rockstar support does jack shit to help
[1:37:09] Aha_McAco: i dunno feels random
[1:37:21] Awselot: real
[1:37:23] DKDKDK_Official: I never done that, I just flew from A to B.
[1:37:31] bradthgamer: @Maxey_sauce i used to get that a lot a few years ago
[1:37:34] DKDKDK_Official: But yeah, fast travel should have been a thing.
[1:37:36] trucker12399: earlier today me and 2 friends did a salvage yard robbery and got kicked into 3 separate session
[1:37:37] AmbiguousAlx: i dont understand why taxis dont work in the online dviperSad dviperSad
[1:37:40] xxthe_trimmerxx: silly and annoying
[1:37:44] imgoodwithusernames: It would break the lore…
[1:37:52] ch0sen01ne: taxi is a thing on consoles right
[1:38:00] SoAaron_: no
[1:38:03] Takkie79: at least RDO has fast travel, so there is hope for gtaVI online
[1:38:12] Hey_Left: rip the warp out glitch
[1:38:22] seekingtreasure: limesGiggle
[1:38:24] druberrie: dviperHappy

[1:38:41] Aha_McAco: well you can use taxi. once.
[1:38:49] xxthe_trimmerxx: @AmbiguousAlx like campaign? it wont work like that cuz ppl are evil and they gonna find dupe glitch or worse
[1:38:57] drea_thea: LUL
[1:39:00] Awselot: i can understand it to like a degree so ppl dont grief and just teleport away but they could go the battlefield route where you cant spawn on someone when theyre in combat and in gta maybe they could have a 5 min cooldown after combat or smthn lol
[1:39:03] Takkie79: job auto adds them to ceo
[1:39:13] bradthgamer: free roam missions require it
[1:39:16] rainhopp: Honestly the phrase "that's just dumb" pretty much sums up all of GTA Online
[1:39:21] xxthe_trimmerxx: @xxthe_trimmerxx or rockstar dont care
[1:39:36] DKDKDK_Official: Shooting through building in GTA:O with advanced sniper rifle that has Thermal Scope on it. A long time now I did it constantly. Could you check Matto? dviperWave (You can see the enemy as a "orange" dot through the buildings, while scoping.)

[1:40:41] rainhopp: dviperDead
[1:40:44] g1steezy: The darkviperau twins
[1:40:44] SoAaron_: I hope all these stupid things are because they never knew how successful the game would be so didn't have the proper infrastructure, surely GTA 6 will know online is a big success so improves everything. Guess we'll see
[1:40:57] Azray90: A positive point for Rockstar i Lost my MK2 oppressori and they refund me half the price. but seemed liked i actually didn't Lost It, and when i told them i finally found It they didn't took the Money they refound me back back
[1:41:12] seekingtreasure: dviperSad
[1:41:23] francskgp: Any function that implies a passage of time such as teleportation (fast travel) in gta online should use session switching, the only thing that makes it horrible is the loading times
[1:41:36] AmbiguousAlx: there needs to be more open world online crime games
[1:41:40] DKDKDK_Official: @Azray90 LUL LUL
[1:41:52] overkil: me watching myself lie
[1:41:55] rainhopp: @azray90 so rockstar did something good, I'm shocked
[1:42:00] bradthgamer: LUL
[1:42:03] BrentButler: Enable the disable. Classic!
[1:42:03] ch0sen01ne: LUL
[1:42:05] xxthe_trimmerxx: rockstar should be to blame for many things but they have done good things but mostly bad things and all we make fuzz bout is the bad things
[1:42:06] Azray90: I know right
[1:42:14] MrSmooth360: @hihi217 dviperCheck
[1:42:18] Takkie79: the meme LUL
[1:42:19] seekingtreasure: enable to disable

[1:43:00] xxthe_trimmerxx: my brain is disabled
[1:43:07] AmbiguousAlx: maybe rockstar just enjoys trolling you
[1:43:13] SoAaron_: even the definitive edition had enable disable enemy outline lol
[1:43:18] ch0sen01ne: still now it is an issue LUL
[1:43:20] onlypom_: but this issue all comes down to reading comprehension, even tho the game restart issue is a biig problem
[1:43:32] MrSmooth360: yesterday
[1:43:34] francskgp: you can disable my enable
[1:43:41] seekingtreasure: SoAaron_ at least they're consistent

[1:44:34] trucker12399: 10 years and millions to billions of dollars
[1:44:36] MrSmooth360: you say the same thing twice here btw, listen to your words
[1:44:44] xxthe_trimmerxx: to be honest rockstar had too MUCH time to fix and add better stuff and they didnt cuz they forgor
[1:45:05] francskgp: but what about the phone dialogue man
[1:45:23] BrentButler: Excellent part here to be like "It's better now!"
[1:45:31] bradthgamer: LUL
[1:45:37] Takkie79: at least they fixed this LUL
[1:45:39] Fossabot: Follow me on TikTok for random funny bits: https://tiktok.com/@darkviperau
[1:45:42] ch0sen01ne: LUL
[1:45:44] xxthe_trimmerxx: and expensive
[1:45:45] DKDKDK_Official: I had a bug where if you lagged, they couldn't hit you. :D
[1:45:51] Sanji315: to be fair higher ups could definitely make these decisions because they are ignorant about how annoying it is for actual gameplay
[1:45:55] imgoodwithusernames: Please post a reaction to this reaction in another 2 years
[1:45:56] francskgp: even though they improved it it's still mediocre
[1:45:59] seekingtreasure: 50% eavWow
[1:46:03] trucker12399: a 100% better fix
[1:46:11] ch0sen01ne: it is so much better now LUL
[1:46:20] trucker12399: or well 99% less inputs

[1:46:47] matthewoher69: hi matto
[1:46:57] DKDKDK_Official: Waow
[1:46:58] imgoodwithusernames: Then they rearranged the menu
[1:47:02] francskgp: the whole snacks/armor healing system is dumb overall
[1:47:04] jaisafeen: not fixed in cars tho
[1:47:04] cattogun97: W
[1:47:07] avocados_808: Hated having to do that before
[1:47:10] rainhopp: %99 of the things that they've added are absolutely useless this is the only good thing they've done
[1:47:25] vincent74755: @DarkViperAU did u get to play GTA Sand Andreas multi during its heyday
[1:47:25] vvlutador: Couldn't you use snacks in the weapon wheels like now?
[1:47:29] ch0sen01ne: hope they use a system similar to rdr2
[1:47:32] slothehhh: what's your favourite gta online snack?
[1:47:35] big_motherman: i love men
[1:47:49] MachinaZombie: developers are told to prioritize fixes software bugs based on what returns profit immediately
[1:47:59] AmbiguousAlx: they should just make thecover healing mechanics heal you fully
[1:48:13] seekingtreasure: devs when you dropped this: limesSob
[1:48:23] mansgonemad: what if the snacks were lollipops?
[1:48:23] DKDKDK_Official: Allright I leave. But for last word: Shooting through building in GTA:O with advanced sniper rifle that has Thermal Scope on it. Could you check Matto? dviperWave
[1:48:32] francskgp: gta online 2 better be a fundementally different game
[1:48:48] vincent74755: Gematria Effect News 25
[1:48:56] xxthe_trimmerxx: they gotta fix security too,rn is  way too ez for a guy with a potato launcher ddos u or ban your acc
[1:49:32] Awselot: i love your cayo perico video
[1:49:43] ch0sen01ne: cayo was the best heist
[1:49:55] Sidobamba4: I think the setups where a bit boring
[1:49:57] sseemour: cayo just feels nice because its not a meat grinder like most others
[1:50:02] d2pox: big w
[1:50:09] cj24445555: im watching you play sekiro right now aswell
[1:50:09] bradthgamer: you can travel back to the party
[1:50:12] Takkie79: console is reason probably
[1:50:18] imgoodwithusernames: If Cayo was done on the original map it wouldn’t be as good
[1:50:21] xxthe_trimmerxx: like north yankton?
[1:50:39] francskgp: can't wait to sniper dance and spam explosives for pvp in the next online

[1:51:23] xxthe_trimmerxx: @francskgp or t bag u with realistic bolls
[1:51:24] MrSmooth360: it was gunrunning
[1:51:37] SoAaron_: Lester references the online character in story mode when talking to Michael
[1:51:39] Takkie79: yeah Agent 14 mentioned 2017 first time
[1:51:53] AmbiguousAlx: gunrunning takes place in 2017 so doomsday is after the story
[1:51:54] bradthgamer: yeah it doesnt make sense
[1:51:54] MrSmooth360: it was gunrunning that broke the timeline
[1:51:56] 69exp: You can be called from 2012 and 2023 at the same time
[1:52:01] Sidobamba4: your the only streamer that is in  the GTA6VoiceActor category
[1:52:04] JRD999_: Online protagonist Time Traveler confirmed.
[1:52:09] francskgp: even with how it's explained in the gtawiki its still confusing
[1:52:12] mulatta_damage: Isn't that the case for Lamar in online
[1:52:13] imgoodwithusernames: Our Online character is a time traveler confirmed
[1:52:58] JRD999_: dviperTail
[1:53:10] sennyKek: That would be the Final Fantasy XIV approach, gotta complete all the old patches first before you can play with your friends :ppp
[1:53:17] xxthe_trimmerxx: they have never reused o revisited north yankton other than story mode yk has  potential for great content
[1:53:17] Chitomarty: so after doomsday storymode happened and all new dlcsare now after the story ?
[1:53:29] sennyKek: @Chitomarty Yeah pretty much
[1:53:48] Chitomarty: @sennyKek oh okok ty
[1:53:54] MrSmooth360: @Chitomarty everything after gunrunning
[1:54:10] francskgp: darkviper expert in game design
[1:54:18] larbitn: what about rdro mecanics its closer to gta6 then 5
[1:54:19] 69exp: And you get rapidfired
[1:54:21] MrSmooth360: woah woah woah... spoilers Matt
[1:54:25] bradthgamer: @MrSmooth360 what year was gunrunning? 2017?
[1:54:26] imgoodwithusernames: That’s why it’s so popular
[1:54:33] MrSmooth360: @bradthgamer yes
[1:54:35] SoAaron_: @xxthe_trimmerxx North Yankton as it is in story mode is very basic, most of it is not textured, only areas important to story. They would have to update it a lot for it to be suitable in online
[1:54:44] yaboyirce: austincsBozo

[1:56:40] regynate: !tts it's me, Agatha, I am here to inform you that I am back
[1:56:41] d2pox: nope
[1:56:42] BrentButler: There's a story? I mean, the individual updates have stories, but that's about it.
[1:56:46] little_jamie_baby_: no not really
[1:56:47] InfernalPegasus98: Lester getting a gf i guess
[1:56:49] Awselot: yeah theyre good and fun but not really like WOAH
[1:56:49] IamTheAngryBuddhist: People play online for the story?
[1:56:52] coles171: story sucks and just exsisits to drive the gameplay
[1:56:55] SoAaron_: no one cares about story in online games, people only cares for what pays good
[1:56:57] regynate: ok cool
[1:57:01] MrSmooth360: @regynate I had to use it earlier dviperGiggle
[1:57:07] xxthe_trimmerxx: @SoAaron_ i mean the main map has some mayor online exclusive stuff so i dont see why would be that a problem
[1:57:13] imgoodwithusernames: My 12 year old self who had only ever played Minecraft thought it was amazing
[1:57:14] francskgp: the dialogue in gta online is so obnoxious
[1:57:17] seekingtreasure: BrentButler yeah i was sitting here trying to think of it
[1:57:17] regynate: @MrSmooth360 oh dviperDerp
[1:57:25] AmbiguousAlx: i guess some of the online characters are entertaining, like dax or english dave
[1:57:27] yaboyirce: being a silent protagonist was such a boring decision
[1:57:27] MrSmooth360: lucky it worked else footage would've been ruined
[1:57:27] Awselot: gta 3 👀
[1:57:36] regynate: why didn't you unpause alerts
[1:57:40] BrentButler: There's nothing cohesive throughout the various updates.
[1:57:45] sennyKek: The problem with Online is that it's all PLOT and no story, precisely because your player character never speaks and thus has no agency. Everything happens at them, instead of them doing things.
[1:57:56] regynate: rewards*
[1:57:58] eldoradobrougham: story would be better if our character went into witness protection
[1:58:11] vaporwaved: dviperDead

[1:58:23] bradthgamer: xD
[1:58:24] JRD999_: dviperNotes
[1:58:28] mrstellargaming: would it be better if we had like 4 voices to pick from to actually have some story
[1:58:41] cattogun97: Agency
[1:58:42] yaboyirce: Higher ups aroMad
[1:58:46] ch0sen01ne: Agency
[1:59:03] SoAaron_: @xxthe_trimmerxx the problem with NY is that its the illusion of being a big place when really its one road with a small town, church with graveyard and the cash depot, everything else is untextured and nothing. Idk how they would make that work, its not a simple addition basically
[1:59:06] sseemour: Agency and Gun Van were nice
[1:59:17] MrSmooth360: @regynate For a directors commentary where he's constantly watching, pausing, and talking I figured it wouldn't hurt to leave them paused for the time being
[1:59:25] IamTheAngryBuddhist: Ammo drop?
[1:59:25] brunolate98: That was the lost and the damned
[1:59:37] GayPotatoEmma: GayPotatoEmma subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 31 months! hope you're doing alright dviperLove
[1:59:37] Fossabot: Helllll Yeeaaahh dviperHappy
[1:59:39] Wryfrost: Snacks from your ass xD
[1:59:39] rainhopp: To be fair summoning ammo from your arse is a feature I like
[1:59:39] Awselot: i wish i could get ammo out of my ass dviperSad
[1:59:40] BrentButler: Snacks should be nowhere near my ass.
[1:59:47] 69exp: If your ass has bullets it must have food too
[1:59:59] mrstellargaming: they have ammo drop that doesnt have armour
[2:00:10] brunolate98: I think you can only get armor in the agency
[2:00:27] regynate: @regynate dviperHmmm that's a fair point dviperNotes ah well, I unpaused them already
[2:00:30] Bagpipe__: it's just a reason to keep you in the game a little bit longer
[2:00:35] francskgp: The narratives in GTA Online are really just there to give some sort of reason for the crazy stuff we do as players
[2:00:35] rainhopp: You should at least be able to decide what you put in your ass
[2:00:48] AarwinJoe: Day by day  i see u matto without the beard and everday i see how gorjeus ure eyes are  you majestic human specimen
[2:00:55] MrSmooth360: AGATHA
[2:00:59] yaboyirce: Agartha Pog
[2:00:59] mansgonemad: why is it called armour when it goes on your torso?
[2:01:01] ch0sen01ne: AGATHA Pog
[2:01:04] MrSmooth360: PogBones
[2:01:07] bradthgamer: higher ups
[2:01:12] brunolate98: I think they just forgot to program it and just copy and paste the same menu and mechanic
[2:01:15] trucker12399: i wish you could buy armour in the moc,terrobyte and avenger (since they have the gun thingy)
[2:01:29] V3D4N7_: hii

[2:01:39] rainhopp: like you should just be able to decide if you want armour or snacks or ammo up your ass
[2:01:41] francskgp: voicemail app would easily fix that problem
[2:01:43] brunolate98: Ah yes, this is Agatha

[2:08:39] GarryGREY: I don't play online, unless I have something to do or watch on the side. It's all loading screens and I alt-tabbed most of the time

[2:10:38] brwinner5350: @MrSmooth360 Hello MrSmooth dviperLove
[2:10:44] regynate: @regynate dviperHmmm I think I can fix this
[2:10:56] GarryGREY: You think GTA IV did it better? Just game modes with an option to free roam and mess around?
[2:11:10] francskgp: really hope that having your player blip be displayed on the map would be optional.
[2:11:19] MrSmooth360: hello @brwinner5350 dechartHugX
[2:11:19] imgoodwithusernames: Online 2 will also include a battle royal mode

[2:14:16] larbitn: the game dosent even run on a server
[2:14:22] francskgp: what would be the ideal implementation for you?
[2:14:47] GarryGREY: The game is p2p, giving cheaters super easy time LUL
[2:14:56] BrentButler: I very nearly exclusively play GTAO in an invite only lobby.
[2:14:58] tahs9n: its not even a server its a p2p connection.
[2:15:05] ImDamianator: DarkViper reactions???? I never knew you stooped so low!!!
[2:15:22] GarryGREY: Rockstar is too poor for dedicated servers
[2:15:23] seekingtreasure: BrentButler same, i've only ever been to public lobbies by accident
[2:15:37] BrentButler: Loading on Xbox Series X is AMAZING.
[2:15:39] francskgp: a really good change would be making it optional to have player blips being displayed on the map
[2:15:56] obese_microwave2: when was this released'
[2:16:05] Awselot: omg the days you had to wait 10 mins and if you tabbed out youd be screwed
[2:16:07] bradthgamer: @BrentButler true. takes like 10 seconds to load into story mode
[2:16:13] JRD999_: I feel like there should be an intermission when people leave so that other people could join mid-heist dviperHug
[2:16:23] GarryGREY: Even then, your loading times are highly depends on players in the lobby. Compare entering a building in public vs private lobby.
[2:16:38] tahs9n: whaaaaat NOOO
[2:16:49] whitewer: p2p servers is their biggest issue
[2:17:07] bradthgamer: is rdo p2p?
[2:17:16] larbitn: is servers that expensive for a multi billion company

[2:18:07] francskgp: Griefing isn't inherently bad for GTA Online; Rockstar's failure lies in not crafting a balanced environment where it enhances gameplay rather than detracts
[2:18:08] tamzyn__: the announcement of 6 proves that they can have both
[2:18:42] bradthgamer: if gta 5 didnt become as big as it is gta 6 probably would have come out in 2018/2019
