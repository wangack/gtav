[1:32:06] sparcov: well just buy a house simple
[1:32:12] original_khawk: Standard definition is 480i and 576i, these things are not subjective, they are literal definitions SMHing streamer
[1:32:14] DieMrCupCake: The difference between 480 and 720 is huge

[1:34:42] ruthlessthered: In 2010 720 was HD
[1:34:44] sunnyhoneytea: i do when my wifi is slow
[1:34:45] sao_mito: 720 SD 1080 HD 1440P UHD
[1:34:45] Nomad_Ninja: 720p is the first iteration of High Definition, 1080p is called "FullHD" and 4k = "UltraHD"
[1:34:50] c4rb3nn: im watching in 720p
[1:34:50] Fossabot:  whipStinky Please do not tell streamer what to do or how to do it unless specifically asked by streamer, even if he forgets or doesn't see something. Back-seating acts as an unwanted external influence to the roleplay.
[1:34:52] MinisterOfThump: yeanah glizzyR withRizz glizzyL
[1:34:55] pepe_silvia_as: youtube doesnt even define 720p as HD anymore AAAA

[1:34:59] Chopppperrrr: PepeLmao
[1:35:07] Apporatory: I don’t even watch, I listen to audio only
[1:35:07] geckoZen: blu-ray HD, 720p
[1:35:58] krissloud: facts
[1:35:59] DieMrCupCake: 4k is the future. 1440 will be the new "budget"
[1:36:00] Nomad_Ninja: since 480p (standard defintion) was the only option for decades... 720p became the first "high definition".
[1:36:11] sao_mito: Then you have 8K
[1:36:13] dexbrah: 1440p will be the new standard for sure
[1:36:14] yolfiic: tru
[1:36:26] geckoZen: i got uhhh 1280p and 4k
[1:36:27] Spencerezz: what monitor do you have?
[1:36:29] Nomad_Ninja: nah, they'll come up with a new name
[1:36:31] dexbrah: 1080p wont go anywhere, it's huge in the esport scene with crazy refresh rates
[1:36:32] Hiyasu_Gaming: ?? 8k movies why not
[1:36:51] WikiDic: im thinking they will up over the 1440 and the 1080 will be the cheapy and the 8k will be the bigger one

[1:37:24] yukisushie: kaiouraBlind
[1:37:27] original_khawk: 720 is literally by definition HD, 1080 is by definition Full HD, 480i is by definition SD, curvyeNLT Streamer, these things are not subjective, they never change, the new thing just gets a new name to differentiate it
[1:37:34] Hippleus: I'm a 4 eyed freak how did he know
[1:37:34] Bigcountry182: Yeah 1080 aint going anywhere.  It's cheaper for companies that stream to do 1080 plus not everyone has internet stability for full 4k streaming
[1:38:01] Nomad_Ninja: Technicaly = correct
[1:38:07] Pl4sm4_Ro4ch_jtv: according to steam ... 1080p is still the most used resolution, gonna be a long while before any other becomes the standard

[1:39:20] original_khawk: @Usahi_Light they did NODDERS but it takes up a shit ton of bandwidth and its not worth it due to compression
[1:39:22] Sigfred42: The main reason 1080p will stay around for a while will be because of batteries. The higher the pixel count the worse battery performance.
[1:39:24] Lifeonfire22: Twitch is increasing sub prices in Canada, Australia, and the UK whipMad

[1:40:05] original_khawk: @Lifeonfire22 kivaNOOO no more using VPN to sub for cheaper by telling twitch im in the US Sadge
[1:40:08] Nomad_Ninja: yeah, 936p is the more efficient use of bandwidth when considering the bitrate caps that are enforced. more pixels (higher res) needs more bitrate to maintain the same image quality
