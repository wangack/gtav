[2:52:11] filican606: @lmrainy so i think it's safe to rule out desync and it could be a stuck invisible hitbox in the character model colliding with the glitched phone hence the lack of exploding cars @jeannnbean

[3:09:56] honor234567: I'm not a pilot
[3:10:03] filican606: @UberHaxorNova so the theory is going that the phone glitch is only one of two requirements for the carnado to happen one is having something in your hand like a box or a glitched out phone and another is having some sort of invisible hitbox become stuck in your character model which i could only guess can happen after ramming into a bunch of news stand or garbage bins. You have to do this since it looks like nothing is colliding with the car itself since the car only takes damage from the groun
