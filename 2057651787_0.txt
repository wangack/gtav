[5:47:30] filipe_vasconcellos_: pepeMeltdown
[5:47:35] MAZM0L: @MAZM0L I think he already knows sani but cult should buy of him KEKW
[5:47:46] minnmor: he is playing candy crush with the bags

[5:58:00] filipe_vasconcellos_: what?
[5:58:03] MAZM0L: ?
[5:58:04] Bruvverbean: pallets give more?
[5:58:19] CAYKE__: NOPERS
[5:58:19] nikolegrnd: nikkisHm
[5:58:22] MAZM0L: why?
[5:58:24] filipe_vasconcellos_: why?
[5:59:08] CAYKE__: Like I said, he's a lone wolf trying to work as a team. and its being a struggle.
[5:59:17] MAZM0L: so a re RUN without NIck
[5:59:33] MrSpiny: Yup
[5:59:40] CAYKE__: NODDERS
[5:59:52] CAYKE__: and unfortunately, I think Jenny is the onlly person who can convince him of that.
[5:59:56] MAZM0L: tbh I feel like only way he gets what he wants and make chanegs is becoming the leader with some support
[6:00:03] walterz930: put Reggie in charge
[6:00:10] filipe_vasconcellos_: technically would be you mac and mick running the stuff the others would help. I think if was you and him he wouldn't have a problem
[6:00:44] nyx_constellation: No, he will always have to comprise. And he is used to having the resources not to.
[6:01:02] GrumpyMark01: If only he was still a multi-millionaire
[6:01:06] MrSpiny: he doesn’t want to be in control katesGiggle
[6:01:24] Bruvverbean: It never will atm
[6:01:27] MAZM0L: finding yes people is hard
[6:01:31] Chritters: If people contribute to something, they're going to have expectations of getting the rewards.
[6:01:31] nyx_constellation: He wants to be in control when he wants to
[6:01:39] MAZM0L: @Chritters true
[6:01:54] MAZM0L: so back two 2 houses
[6:02:08] minnmor: he might expect that he has more freedom if the rules are set by him, jenny and mac when they are house owners
[6:02:39] CAYKE__: Yep. Michael has to learn how to work as a team.
[6:02:41] Nightbot: Join Nikki's Discord "The Dumpster" and become a true Trash Baby nikkisTrashb https://discord.gg/trashbaby nikkisTrashb
[6:02:48] CAYKE__: Leaders IMO have LESS freedom
[6:02:55] Arexian: i feel like he want to be back to 3.0 Michael when he could do what he wanted when he wanted
[6:03:00] MAZM0L: @CAYKE__ new chapter unlock - Micheal learning there no I in team
[6:03:02] filipe_vasconcellos_: i mean it can always you and him alone and if he wants help for a heist he talks to people for it. first come first served
[6:03:08] Crazith: I feel this house has less rules then most of the gangs I have seen
[6:03:16] MAZM0L: @filipe_vasconcellos_ true
[6:03:24] CAYKE__: truth Crazith
[6:03:39] nyx_constellation: He always said he didn't care about money, but his money allowed him to be like that
[6:03:42] CAYKE__: the city isnt set up for lone wolves.
[6:03:43] TheChaosGang: he has more freedom than he realizes
[6:03:46] CAYKE__: you NEED others
[6:03:55] Bruvverbean: two people can't fund heists, and talking to others wont work, like notHOA will take notHOA over Michael
[6:03:57] MAZM0L: he can only passive income for so long - he has what couple weeks left + holiday.
[6:04:08] CAYKE__: leaning on other people
[6:04:10] CAYKE__: KEKW
[6:04:15] MAZM0L: Finding people?
[6:04:19] Bruvverbean: fear of asking for help?
[6:04:45] CAYKE__: Jenny could do it all by herself.
[6:04:52] Chritters: Unfortunately, no matter how you go about it, people are going to have expectations of him. And even in a new house with new rules, he's still at risk of upsetting people by doing his own thing. It doesn't necessarily solve the problem at hand.
[6:05:06] TheChaosGang: tough to want shared resources with no rules or accountability
[6:05:31] CAYKE__: And being a lone wolf, even if he can get into crime with other people, those other people will always turn to their crews first.
[6:05:37] erinord: Having another house with computers I guess could help some, it seems like he just needs space away from his brother
[6:05:49] minnmor: only thing the new house will "fix" is the problem of who could come to the house and who not
[6:05:50] jamm0302: like fully running gangs need a person involved in everything
[6:05:53] nyx_constellation: It might improve it though, because he additionally just reacts to nick
[6:06:20] Raazetko: Michael will bring anyone he want in the house LUL
[6:06:32] CAYKE__: Only person who is breaking those rules is Michael.
[6:06:36] jamm0302: and then what happened got used to stir
[6:06:45] MAZM0L: people could set a mental plan and then hit the house.
[6:06:49] MrSpiny: HOA got robbed already
[6:07:08] erinord: Then he broke the rules with Erin, the least trustworthy person he could choose KEKW
[6:07:15] Crazith: just having access for a short time can cause a lot of damage, just like how the house key can be copied within a second
[6:07:17] Bruvverbean: Erin stirred PepeLaugh
[6:07:23] iwannabeaWeasley: i think Nick has to wake up and deal with repercussions when the rules are broken
[6:07:27] nyx_constellation: Does Michael have a lot of experience wirh consequences for his actions? I can only think of 2 examples
[6:07:28] Raazetko: Erin even snitched on michael as well LUL
[6:07:28] filipe_vasconcellos_: YEP
[6:07:29] jamm0302: and i feel mick maybe thinks erin is not pushing an agenda when maybe she is
[6:07:37] CAYKE__: I love michael to death, but right now Michael is making it very hard on himself.
[6:07:46] stridro: he gots to learn erin is shit stirs
[6:07:55] MAZM0L: @stridro and that she is very loud
[6:08:08] stridro: ^
[6:08:08] Nightbot: ^^ What they said nikkisSmile
[6:08:25] MAZM0L: you wanted to loan wolf again?
[6:08:37] Crazith: Erin loves to stir and Michael already agreed she has done this multiple times to him
[6:08:40] CAYKE__: the notHOA isn't going to be better for michael. everyone has rules.
[6:08:40] Tuckerbonage: To be fair Erin knows Nick more then Michael so I doubt she expected Nick to act that way to her and Micheal KEKW
[6:08:45] Raazetko: He does have a soft spot for Erin, so he doesn''t see that Erin is stirring
[6:08:47] Chritters: There was a lot of blind faith happening.
[6:09:48] Chritters: She also tried to do it again with saying he was joining notHoA. So, it's technically 3 times.
[6:09:53] MAZM0L: I feel like michael also can't say fuck off to erin. cause he likes chilling with her
[6:09:59] CAYKE__: Yeah yall have a passive income for the house thats legal
[6:10:00] Bruvverbean: we'll probably only see them when you get subpoenaed nikkisGiggle
[6:10:02] ImMcGuirk: the only solution is for jenny to murder Erin Kappa
[6:10:07] MAZM0L: @Raazetko Yes this
[6:10:28] jamm0302: also in nothoa he wont be first come when it comes to heist stuff an resources used i feel
[6:10:59] MAZM0L: it will come to a time where you need more then that nikea money / and michael wont do another mayor term.
[6:11:04] MAZM0L: his fomo is bad tbh.
[6:11:09] CAYKE__: that soft spot is NO DIFFERENT than winston
[6:11:13] CAYKE__: EXACTLY
[6:11:22] Tuckerbonage: Well her saying he's joining NotHoa wasn't really a stir
[6:11:26] Bruvverbean: NODDERS
[6:11:45] MrInquisitor: Nick's feels just as bad as his @mazm0l
[6:11:55] MAZM0L: @MrInquisitor yeah
[6:11:57] Chritters: And Michael kind of got proven right with Winston and how he treated Jenny recently.
[6:12:05] jamm0302: ya and erin is smarter then people think in alot of ways
[6:12:43] CAYKE__: Erin fakes her way through being 'not smart' to gather info.
[6:12:50] MAZM0L: @CAYKE__ YES
[6:12:57] MAZM0L: she acts like reed @CAYKE__
[6:13:05] Bruvverbean: he's a gangslut NODDERS
[6:13:25] MrSpiny: they don’t see the same Michael that the FEMLY sees katesGiggle
[6:13:29] nyx_constellation: Well, that is what he was used to
[6:13:36] CAYKE__: yep
[6:14:02] MrInquisitor: Yeah, Mick got his free W with the Winston stuff
[6:14:21] CAYKE__: thats why family house has been so beneficial. yall are keeping up with BIG GANGS in terms with the hiest
[6:14:21] jamm0302: ya he kinda writes it off as erin being erin more then she has a motive
[6:14:31] erinord: She even told him to his face she was snaking him yesterday KEKW
[6:14:36] MAZM0L: everyone is out for there own selfs - so they will do that
[6:14:46] MAZM0L: as michael said info is key
[6:15:09] nyx_constellation: And he blames jenny for being to loyal
[6:15:10] Tuckerbonage: I don't know why people have a problem with 3k a week when people can just do a G6 run to get it easy
[6:15:25] nikolegrnd: YESSS
[6:15:28] MAZM0L: YESSS
[6:15:37] MAZM0L: I saw that meta
[6:15:38] csplisskin: YEP

[6:16:22] MrInquisitor: But not a leader
[6:16:25] CAYKE__: and Michael keeps looking for an out
[6:16:28] CAYKE__: and its mind boggling
[6:16:43] Tirias: Tirias subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! 
[6:16:52] minnmor: too bad for mick that jenny is the want to think these... will he get new talk tomorrow? ;D
[6:17:02] minnmor: *one

[6:17:20] nikolegrnd: he already has the loyalty thats what make groups strong in LS
[6:17:40] minnmor: needs to start it with "dont get mad at me"
[6:17:41] Chritters: @nikolegrnd Yeah, but he's actively risking alienating those loyal to him right now. :)

[7:17:42] MAZM0L: she meant to stir and if she told rod she did it on purpose to boast

[7:18:42] CAYKE__: Michael doesn't follow common sense rules KEKW
[7:18:46] MsAutumnWind: why is he asking if he doesn’t believe Rod hahaha
[7:18:50] MAZM0L: Michael just ask do I have free will do what I want with your resources
[7:18:50] bluesfan77: The rule is there is no rule.
[7:18:55] colacubes1: I mean they went mental over Luther and the car
[7:18:55] ianrbf: HoA has Game of Thrones... There's not a lot of rules
[7:19:06] BritnikUK: the common sense ones are the problem MIchael has
[7:19:15] nyx_constellation: Reed is good at gang things though
[7:19:20] Crazith: Reed is stupid smart with his actions
[7:19:20] nikolegrnd: reed follows rules

[7:19:41] MAZM0L: that is why he follows it
[7:19:42] MrSpiny: simpledFacepalm
[7:19:52] CAYKE__: Just an unofficial,official alliance
[7:19:58] nyx_constellation: Everyone runs to protect andi
[7:19:58] vampy3x6: sounds familiar nikezNODDERS
[7:20:05] jamm0302: the ogs siz and andi have the sway
[7:20:49] MsAutumnWind: kinda comes with being in a group
[7:21:02] jamm0302: example if mick spent but coin without asking whould they be upset
[7:21:10] peter9517: he is really trying to use everything to prove his point
[7:21:12] ianrbf: one of you would be appointed as a high command with enough power to make decisions for the whole group
[7:21:12] csplisskin: Tobias time to brush the dust off of Marko Kappa
[7:21:23] CAYKE__: Essentially, dont unilaterally making choices for people
[7:21:24] minnmor: @jamm0302 ^
[7:21:31] MAZM0L: they don't hold grudges
[7:21:40] NuTr1x: im sure hoa will be fine with him spending all their btc out of their hours nikkisGiggle
[7:21:51] CAYKE__: 100%
[7:21:52] MAZM0L: Erin would mald ^
[7:22:07] jamm0302: thats what i think he is asking is would he have the power to make that call
[7:22:10] Bruvverbean: you lead, Jenny shadow lead nikkisMadgeClap
[7:22:11] erinord: No kidding
[7:22:12] nyx_constellation: nikkisGiggle

[7:22:20] naturewise17: who whould've thunk it
[7:22:22] dasRaptor: Clueless
[7:22:28] MAZM0L: Clueless
[7:22:28] nikolegrnd: plot twist
[7:22:34] MrSpiny: he doesnt want to lead, and he doesnt want to be lead. so, what does he want shdiHmm
[7:22:41] TheChaosGang: that’s what I was going to say, no one likes that
[7:22:43] Nightbot: Join Nikki's Discord "The Dumpster" and become a true Trash Baby nikkisTrashb https://discord.gg/trashbaby nikkisTrashb
[7:22:56] MsAutumnWind: MacGregor is right, it’s different than a regimented Southside gang
[7:22:58] CAYKE__: tobiiiSipspin
[7:23:09] MAZM0L: hmm
[7:23:40] MAZM0L: @msautumnwind depends though
[7:23:41] TKO552: ... yeagar was like that then too
[7:23:45] EternitysRaven: Any gang essentially boils down to the same thing, even if they say they don't
[7:23:52] jamm0302: ^^^
[7:24:00] nyx_constellation: I feel like there is a lot of stuff said between the lines and I hope Michael realises that
[7:24:14] CAYKE__: He's already got what notHOA has
[7:24:18] CAYKE__: with less restrictions
[7:24:21] nieriel__: He honestly would have more power to stick with have he has.
[7:24:23] EternitysRaven: He just needs to lead his own group and stop fighting being the leader
[7:24:23] CAYKE__: I just wish he'd see that
[7:24:28] nikolegrnd: he has even more
[7:24:35] minnmor: and no money requirements
[7:24:37] ianrbf: beetle13KEK
[7:24:41] MAZM0L: just listening
[7:24:45] CAYKE__: KEKW
[7:24:47] jamm0302: and he will be first in line with the family stuff not sure with the hoa
[7:24:49] CAYKE__: its been obvcious michael!
[7:24:50] Bruvverbean: KEKW
[7:24:50] naturewise17: ty rod KEKW
[7:24:50] nyx_constellation: Rod is great
[7:25:00] erinord: KEKW
[7:25:05] csplisskin: nikkisGiggle nikkisGiggle classic Michael
[7:25:08] Chritters: KEKW
[7:25:10] nieriel__: He has the power to help make changes with the family stuff, he’ll have less of a voice in the notHoA
[7:25:11] wesfeye: KEKW
[7:25:17] nyx_constellation: Michael can be mission leader, Jenny is going day by day stuff anyways
[7:25:22] MAZM0L: true @nieriel__

[7:26:10] ZalenaStar: ^
[7:26:10] Nightbot: ^^ What they said nikkisSmile
[7:26:11] vampy3x6: co-parenting NODDERS
[7:26:16] filipe_vasconcellos_: @erinord ^
[7:26:17] Bruvverbean: @erinord Prayge
[7:26:17] nyx_constellation: Just coparent
[7:26:18] Tuckerbonage: Just merge KEKW
[7:26:24] csplisskin: NODDERS let him tank the aggro
[7:26:26] MAZM0L: nick respects you also
[7:26:26] CAYKE__: Right?
[7:26:27] jamm0302: kyle was the shield jenny was the sword
[7:26:30] nikolegrnd: does he want to be YOUR shadow leader
[7:26:34] CAYKE__: Jenny and Michael co-leading would MAKE SENSE
[7:26:35] MAZM0L: ^
[7:26:39] nyx_constellation: But he doesn't always listen
[7:26:39] CAYKE__: cuz you could deal with Nick easily
[7:26:42] CAYKE__: you know how to talk to Nick
[7:26:44] filipe_vasconcellos_: @nikolegrnd  NODDERS probably
[7:26:45] minnmor: would he follow if jenny was leader?`;D
[7:26:52] nyx_constellation: Might need to say it again
[7:27:03] stridro: yea he needs understand he needs be the face and ur the brains
[7:27:06] naturewise17: YEP
[7:27:06] nikolegrnd: true
[7:27:09] MAZM0L: yes
[7:27:13] Chritters: He would want you to defer to him in situations, yeah.
[7:27:16] nyx_constellation: Yeah
[7:27:22] Bruvverbean: Jenny would fold to Michael, and Michael would fold to Jenny nikkisGiggle
[7:27:23] CAYKE__: NODDERS
[7:27:28] MAZM0L: he will try take your kindness and use that to his shit - not in a bad way
[7:27:36] CAYKE__: Michael > Jebby > house hold on equal footing.
[7:27:39] GrumpyMark01: If leader Jenny said No, he’d just leave and buy another house
[7:27:56] jamm0302: also with this stuff rod is going to super try and sell it cause he wants more people he is close with in the gang but it might not be fully the whole situation
[7:28:04] Chritters: @Fennomania Eh, that's kinda shitty. Lets not say stuff like that.
[7:28:20] NuTr1x: rod still trying to sell nikkisGiggle
[7:28:20] VoidedZReaper: i have a question.... WHY is this conversation being had with rod here....
[7:28:24] Casper501: I think Nick would be a lot chiller if V would not live in the same house
[7:28:36] jamm0302: ya thats a question for andi and siz
[7:28:46] erinord: @voidedzreaper Because they're talking about joining HOA
[7:29:10] MAZM0L: hmmm
[7:29:15] Bruvverbean: need another Michael and Jenny talk tbh hmmMeeting
[7:29:21] CAYKE__: yup
[7:29:23] colacubes1: why not mick and Jenny co leaders ?
[7:29:26] MAZM0L: yup @bruvverbean
[7:29:35] stridro: ^
[7:29:35] Nightbot: ^^ What they said nikkisSmile
[7:29:36] minnmor: 100% need for a talk again
[7:29:40] MAZM0L: chat book it in
[7:29:55] jamm0302: there will always be more and more coin sinks
[7:29:55] ZalenaStar: I mean, Mick is kinda already treating Jenny as a second by trusting her her to be his proxy in meetings. The dynamic is already there.
[7:30:05] MAZM0L: true
[7:30:05] nyx_constellation: Yeah
[7:30:06] wesfeye: if the btc isnt the issue, the cooldown on jobs will be
[7:30:07] filipe_vasconcellos_: i think you and mick should lead has he said jenny talks for me, you guys can be in the same mindset most of the time
[7:30:07] csplisskin: nikkisHm
[7:30:07] minnmor: and the HQ app has only 12 spots?
[7:30:08] Tuckerbonage: They have group meetings
[7:30:11] TheChaosGang: basic cooperation is still in his conversation
[7:30:13] CAYKE__: Michael needs to decide what he wants and that the grass isnt always greener.
[7:30:23] MAZM0L: true @filipe_vasconcellos_
[7:30:24] sar4h20: and who comes first in getting to use it
[7:30:24] minnmor: he cant invite everyone he wants for heists etc
[7:30:24] colacubes1: doesn’t the the nothoa treat rod badly though?!
[7:30:30] erinord: He should consider doing it officially though, he needs to think about that seriously
[7:30:30] ZalenaStar: @CAYKE__ NODDERS
[7:30:48] Chritters: If you've got a lot of people, it means less opportunity to do things with that BTC because there are more heads to join in heists.
[7:30:50] Tuckerbonage: No they don't @colacubes1 that's just rod being in his mind
[7:31:09] minnmor: @Chritters ^ thisss
[7:31:10] colacubes1: oh okay
[7:31:20] Bruvverbean: with BuTC, what stops the next heist being 1000 per attempt
[7:31:43] CAYKE__: an alliance would make sense
[7:31:46] CAYKE__: NODDERS
[7:31:50] filipe_vasconcellos_: @CAYKE__ ^
[7:31:53] Bruvverbean: an alliance would be better
[7:31:55] saammiiiiiiiiii: tobiiiSipspin tobiiiSipspin tobiiiSipspin tobiiiSipspin tobiiiSipspin tobiiiSipspin
[7:31:57] MAZM0L: more Friends Pog
[7:31:59] nieriel__: Alliance would probably be the better option.
[7:32:07] TheChaosGang: grass is greener, Devil you know vs. devil you don’t. Tough for him to find what he’s looking for
[7:32:14] MrSpiny: doesnt solve the issue
[7:32:15] CAYKE__: Yup
[7:32:28] MAZM0L: true
[7:32:28] filipe_vasconcellos_: they are like 20 people
[7:32:30] CAYKE__: notHOA will always prioritize notHOA
[7:32:38] Bruvverbean: @CAYKE__ YEP
[7:32:49] MAZM0L: they probs have dedicated hackers and other shit
[7:32:49] NuTr1x: and they already have a heist crew
[7:33:06] nyx_constellation: Michael is used to a lot of privilege from every group, cause the whole financial and opportunity situation was different
[7:33:08] nieriel__: Also they would want to be buying heists for NA time zone. I feel they’d be upset if he spent any of the coins during EU time.
[7:33:11] MrSpiny: more members, harder to get a spot (I would think)
[7:33:25] Tuckerbonage: Yeah honestly just talk to Ant and Siz chat just dooming everything KEKW
[7:33:29] Ehnita: I mean... if he is doing shit in AU/EU he would have a spot. notHoA aren't around much then
[7:33:34] ianrbf: hoa always lets everyone try heists. there's not a lot of limitation
[7:33:46] MAZM0L: remember he still had a couple weeks for mayor shit
[7:33:54] jasonarce: Most of these crews in the city are related to each other some how. Lol
[7:33:55] MAZM0L: so he will be locked out for a while
[7:34:09] jamm0302: ya but the city is different if heists cost so much to start down the road
[7:34:35] jamm0302: limited trys limited spots will be tricky
[7:35:14] colacubes1: personally I feel it’s less likely to blow up In their faces if they have their own place
[7:35:24] Tuckerbonage: It isn't really limited spots if you can have people on multiple HQ apps
[7:35:36] csplisskin: classic Mac
[7:36:27] VoidedZReaper: so diamond dogs V2
[7:37:41] sar4h20: at themomeny it sounds like he wants everyone but nick and v???
[7:38:01] peter9517: HUH
[7:38:19] jamm0302: i have seen this talk in reverse i think at th start of the house lol
[7:38:21] Insaif: So what he's doing is...making new rules? KEKW
[7:38:30] stridro: HUHH
[7:38:31] nyx_constellation: Is he.... leading?
[7:38:35] peter9517: HUH 󠀀
[7:38:41] sar4h20: does Michael know anything that anyone is doing? he doesnt seem to
[7:39:00] CAYKE__: then he needs to say that to everyone
[7:39:47] ImMcGuirk: and his void
[7:39:57] CAYKE__: also he's making choices for Nick and V
[7:40:15] MAZM0L: tbh I think nick could be really head of business side
[7:40:45] CAYKE__: Nick didn't care about the gun parts?
[7:40:51] CAYKE__: i thought ?
[7:40:52] Bruvverbean: KEKW
[7:40:57] MAZM0L: Nick messed around with guns before
[7:40:59] csplisskin: nikkisGiggle nikkisGiggle
[7:41:03] erinord: Crime house isn't a bad idea, truthfully
[7:41:15] sar4h20: wants to break rules but also make rules for others
[7:41:19] colacubes1: crime house, nikea house, house house lol
[7:41:23] ghostman16: I hate that people think Nick is always going to not like something
[7:41:38] CAYKE__: so he wants a warehouse
[7:41:48] sar4h20: having a crime house is good, but i dont get why they need to buy out v and nick
[7:41:53] Insaif: If/when the storefronts open up, that might be a better way to handle the Nikea stuff, no?\
[7:41:54] MAZM0L: does he want a clubhouse like lost have.
[7:42:05] nikolegrnd: nikkisHm
[7:42:10] MAZM0L: @Insaif yeah there some locations in poelto for that
[7:42:32] Nightbot: Join Nikki's Discord "The Dumpster" and become a true Trash Baby nikkisTrashb https://discord.gg/trashbaby nikkisTrashb
[7:42:46] wesfeye: cant you just keep it as the family house
[7:42:49] sar4h20: michael rly just speed running this
[7:43:01] VoidedZReaper: Need to get 3 houses in a row in Sandy all in either 1 or a few peoples names and then you can spin it all around those 3 houses in sandy KEKW
[7:43:01] ghostman16: buyout v and Nick will just make Nick feel like he not wanted even though he did crime yesterday?
[7:43:01] ImMcGuirk: nicks gonna just change the locks and kick you all out KEKW
[7:43:14] 0Laetitia0: also when those plans were made little sanguine wasn't a thing
[7:43:21] nieriel__: If y’all by out Nick and V then the house could become the crime house
[7:43:40] MAZM0L: V and Nick don't "live" there currently in rp
[7:43:41] minnmor: and storm hits
[7:43:57] XxTeam48LowesXx: 100% buyout
[7:44:01] nyx_constellation: And then multiple people have a say
[7:44:02] erinord: It's worth asking the question
[7:44:02] Insaif: KEKW
[7:44:08] CAYKE__: He just wants rules he set it seems like?
[7:44:10] erinord: Buy them out or buy a new house
[7:44:11] stridro: instead house cant they buy one the buildings for sell
[7:44:13] sar4h20: just wants to lead over nick ljayeLOL
[7:44:13] filipe_vasconcellos_: nikkisGiggle
[7:44:16] colacubes1: yeah if they gunna buy out, then nikea would have to go too right as it’s nicks and vs company right?
[7:44:24] csplisskin: nikkisHm
[7:44:28] minnmor: i see his mind, he wants place to do crime without the rules that house now has?
[7:44:28] VoidedZReaper: He's living in ALL the timelines...
[7:44:30] MAZM0L: @colacubes1 + reggie
[7:44:32] Bruvverbean: he's speedrunning, and trying everything till it sticks KEKW
[7:44:36] CAYKE__: He's also forgetting he's a dep mayor
[7:44:38] CAYKE__: KEKW
[7:44:42] colacubes1: and Reggie yeah
[7:44:53] hanofearl: to me it seems like he just doesn’t want to be told what to do but he also wants to be in charge but without responsibility
[7:44:54] filipe_vasconcellos_: NODDERS
[7:44:57] CAYKE__: And what if Nick and V don't want to sell?
[7:45:01] CAYKE__: or be bought out yet?
[7:45:02] MAZM0L: i'm so confused
[7:45:03] sar4h20: he doesnt seen to understand that other ppl have things they care about and as there friend hes supposed to count that in
[7:45:18] Casper501: Is Mari also part of the crime stuff?
[7:45:18] nyx_constellation: He wants everything. But that is not how it works.
[7:45:19] hanofearl: yeah he’s making so many assumptions bc he doesn’t want to confront them
[7:45:24] CAYKE__: Like didnt nick get up to crime and stuff yesterday? what then?
[7:45:30] MAZM0L: @Casper501 do they even see her is truth part
[7:45:34] TheDoodlebug1: Getthe stash house and it'll be done.
[7:45:38] ImMcGuirk: I say murder him as well as erin NODDERS
[7:45:44] ImMcGuirk: My solution is murder everyone
[7:45:50] MAZM0L: @CAYKE__ I don't think michael knows that
[7:45:55] 0Laetitia0: have you thought of rioting?
[7:45:58] Casper501: @MAZM0L Thats why asked, I never see her
[7:46:00] colacubes1: so Jenny needs her own house with no one else ^^
[7:46:02] Teletonical: peepoHey
[7:46:10] craigchuk: @0Laetitia0, classic
[7:46:20] MAZM0L: @ImMcGuirk I like this idea
[7:46:26] Teletonical: Hope you’ve been well! :)
[7:46:33] CAYKE__: NODDERS
[7:46:35] nikolegrnd: nikkisSit
[7:46:36] nyx_constellation: So crime house in Michael name. So it's his rules
[7:46:38] Fennomania: This might all just blow over once nick and Michael gets to talk
[7:46:41] MAZM0L: Max Sec seems like a better home NODDERS
[7:46:41] filipe_vasconcellos_: you guys then should do a vote and decide a leader for the house nikkisShrug and then you and mick buy a house for you 2
[7:46:44] erinord: I guess what he wants is to get away from Nick and take Jenny and Mac with him
[7:46:50] TheChaosGang: and the friends
[7:46:52] vampy3x6: and burning bridges with the people you either leave behind or send away
[7:46:53] MAZM0L: @filipe_vasconcellos_ true.
[7:46:53] CAYKE__: it takes a long while to set everything up.
[7:46:55] ghostman16: I’m telling you buying out Nick will make Nick feel like he not wanted at this certain point in time
[7:47:05] MAZM0L: he did say he would like one.
[7:47:10] ImMcGuirk: hear me out... murder NODDERS
[7:47:28] GrumpyMark01: Michael wants a house with his rules, without being leader.  But he can’t do that by himself.
[7:47:41] sar4h20: and then he invited everyone but nick
[7:47:48] filipe_vasconcellos_: nikkisRiot nikkisRiot nikkisRiot nikkisRiot
[7:47:53] 0Laetitia0: nikkisRiot nikkisRiot nikkisRiot
[7:47:55] colacubes1: in theory Michael wants to be shadow leader right?
[7:48:02] colacubes1: nikkisRiot nikkisRiot nikkisRiot
[7:49:06] filipe_vasconcellos_: @colacubes1 looks like it if he wants jenny as leader
[7:49:25] MAZM0L: @colacubes1 but jenny wants it the other way.
[7:49:48] Bruvverbean: @colacubes1 both want the shadow role nikkisGiggle
[7:49:50] Crazith: hear me out, V becomes the leader Kappa
[7:50:08] colacubes1: Michael the dog for leader! xD
[7:50:10] MAZM0L: @Crazith can't wait to do ems and earn less money KEKW
[7:50:17] Fennomania: It's difficult to find balance between 6 people
[7:50:30] warlord2k8: NODDERS
[7:50:37] colacubes1: lol the groups with 15+ must be agony
[7:50:38] warlord2k8: nikkisRiot nikkisRiot nikkisRiot nikkisRiot
