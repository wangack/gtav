[4:51:08] yarnislove: when is the hardcore server gonna launch? or is it still a ways away?
[4:51:08] Zugilol: something that manipulates the market needs to be put into the game while the market is being created not when it has already been manipulated
[4:51:15] njgiantsfan: @sciencegun Or shoes then whenever dex  gets his business he’ll be a billionaire
[4:51:19] Sciencegun: class2 phonebooks

[4:51:53] JpRico: Melee weapons might be up good LUL
[4:51:53] sinister_wolfe: i feel like the only chance it has it to work is for each group have to grind there own price down and up depending on each individual group
[4:51:55] hassauwn: Imagine everyone just starts fighting wars with sticks instead of guns
[4:51:58] fusiondrop: people are already content gated on the server
[4:51:58] hassauwn: Ngl I’d watch
[4:51:59] Fuccboi456: what happened to being able to buy legal class 1s do legal class ones also increase the price of bodies?
[4:52:03] BakinPacman: civ guns cant be scrapped right?

[4:52:38] Armin_Arlert73: @sciencegun factory produces all guns, sells them out of ammunation EZ Kappa
[4:52:38] 3xevilx: PepeStabby meta incoming
[4:52:39] ASomewhatLargeBabyRhino: But shouldn't the goal be to decrease the amount of gatekeeping on the server instead of increasing it?
[4:52:39] Zugilol: knifes become the new class 3
[4:52:43] BakinPacman: make the basic class 1s a static price maybe

[4:55:03] ZuzuRose: but I want the truth, damn it! uhnRee
[4:55:04] NihilistPenguin: All of this is just confusing AF to me. lol
[4:55:05] hassauwn: Instead of guns, just make kamikaze cars

[4:55:37] disco_shepherd: Plastic Tycoon
[4:55:47] Reaperhill: What exists and does not exist is the PDs kyliebStern
[4:55:49] buddha_hands: could you test a system like this without the live environment? IF it's viable in general but needs fixing at least it can be worked on VS when everyone's at 0 & would take months (of frustration) longer
[4:55:52] TheLionKingRichard: Hey chat since I was gone, how long ago was the Dog RP?
[4:55:56] RedPandaKFC: Is the issue that the guns will be more expensive or is it that the price rises directly with how many bodies are out there?
[4:55:56] hypesuke: yep the city is built on Mats
[4:55:59] BakinPacman: what would be interesting is if you could get riflebodies with quality
[4:56:03] mutantnights: plethora of pinatas
[4:56:05] Baracouda12: wdym Bait shoot out and farm cops class 2 Kappa
[4:56:06] Hento: like each bench having its own serial numbered bodys
[4:56:11] njgiantsfan: I do like the idea of diversifying the materials
[4:56:12] BakinPacman: get a poor quality for cheap but it starts at 25 qual
[4:56:13] MrCaboodle: whats siz up to today?
[4:56:15] 3xevilx: yeah that shit suuuucks
[4:56:16] Uthellas: Can anyone make shotguns? @UberHaxorNova
[4:56:20] EvidentGhost: like people craft weapon bodies, then sell those to the people that actually build the weapons NODDERS
[4:56:24] bobbls: honestly gun bodies just reminds me of cleaning supplies where it didnt add to investigations
[4:56:26] hypesuke: you got too
[4:56:27] 3spada_Grande: NODDERS
[4:56:30] wondervviener: Atleast its shaking things up

[4:56:34] montyvi: small scale testing only gets you so far
[4:56:35] darrylop2: @uthellas no
[4:56:37] hypesuke: they not
[4:56:39] ASomewhatLargeBabyRhino: yep NODDERS
[4:56:46] camelplaystv: wipe
[4:56:50] Hento: so you dont think this will ever be wiped again?
[4:56:50] yaboiFenex: the worst part about the rifle bodies is cops cant investigate it thoroughly if you need to be in a gang app to talk to the guy
[4:57:04] Zugilol: i think there needs to be live testing for something like this but not on a server where the market has been manipulated so far
[4:57:05] montyvi: like Authentix (and Trey) said, the landscape in 2 weeks will be interesting
[4:57:06] BR1NGTHERAIN: wipe this Sussy
[4:57:13] RyliksBlackwell1: WIPE DOES NOTHING
[4:57:14] yungVDD: do you think 4.0 will be another economy reset do you think youd wanna grind up again or do something different
[4:57:17] bobbls: it also makes it impossible to hide the fact that you have a bench, though I guess this late it doesnt matter
[4:57:18] Holy_Trees: Just joined back but what happened to Siz court date
[4:57:19] jawnwick99: People also need to realize it's a video game and the economy is never going to be perfectly balanced
[4:57:19] 3spada_Grande: Truuu

[4:57:20] RaLee33: truu
[4:57:20] ToastarN: nope
[4:57:25] ASomewhatLargeBabyRhino: It would have to be a wipe AND a rework of benches/businesses
[4:57:26] hassauwn: Time to RP tariffs, embargoes, and a Great Depression to fix the economy
[4:57:27] cassdoodles: if the money printers stay the same a wipe would mean nothing
[4:57:27] camelplaystv: sorry I meant wipe my ass
[4:57:28] Hento: you would have to remove all the money printers for sure
[4:57:30] Mr_wookiea299: uhnGiga

[4:57:31] bobbls: anyone who sits at the npc can determine who makes guns
[4:57:32] chocodreamzzz: cant reset the economy with out a major content drop i would think
[4:57:35] EvidentGhost: @camelplaystv HUH
[4:57:39] BakinPacman: hard to say what is optimal
[4:57:42] wondervviener: a wipe will only work, as long all the money printers are gone, and you can't just remove these businesses KEKW
[4:57:45] witsseven: Yea seems like 3.0 is in planning for future phase
[4:57:46] Sciencegun: id have to be a wipe plus printer nerf + money sink buff/evasion fixes
[4:57:49] Nemesix11: economy has to be fixed first or you just end up in the same place again
[4:57:51] cbenson18: Wipe at this point is just hoping it causes a mentality reset. Not much else will change
[4:57:59] IamMTxd: play a game just to suffer like irl LUL

[5:06:00] modmoubot: TheModestMouse subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! Joel
[5:06:03] ASomewhatLargeBabyRhino: The RP is what gets groups to reach out since there isn't much else pushing for it, like the troopers shitting at the bar, the nerds with the clone stuff, etc
[5:06:03] Callumahoyhoy: storefronts definitely made that problem worse.  don't even need to leave whatever gang area to get anything you'd want
[5:06:12] 3spada_Grande: Yeah uhnSuffer
[5:06:15] dotzaq: Coke was in a good spot 2.0 bc it was an independent party not a gang controlling it
[5:06:18] Hento: Buffs in everything kinda ruined things too, everything became what buff does this add, rather then RP based
