[3:08:18] TML95gaming: A part of me feels bad for leaving the DAs office, but even when you still try to help they dismiss your help so makes me feel less bad
[3:08:53] Death_Prophet83: Something like that would allow police officers to just turn lights on to run red lights.... Oh wait lol they do that anyway
[3:09:25] TML95gaming: He has no legal right to request that
[3:09:30] mangoinap: Sounds like disobeying

[3:13:05] TML95gaming: Lenny would have 100 percent told them they where in the wrong and dropped the charges
[3:13:13] Aegrusx: Smh someone shouldve objected to Probencrux's food meter being full when he made a picture

[4:28:08] SautterGaming: see if it gives a message
[4:29:31] Husky_SS: I’m just stumped cause you were in the server and now it wont let you back in. oh that may be it.
[4:29:34] SautterGaming: You usually get an error stating multiple connections on same account.
[4:30:22] monadic_bind_: well at least you're reading chat now!
[4:30:30] Husky_SS: lmao
[4:30:52] Fastburn_: Just need to get you shadowbanned and you'll talk to chat.
[4:31:07] The_Herkin: Time to admit it chat, I hacked the server so Occams would talk to chat HACKERMANS
[4:31:20] SautterGaming: if they had a direct connect link to type into the F8 we could try that but I just looked and dont see one
[4:32:01] Empirics_: Im not sure what occams would have to do to get banned but I feel like it would have to be big
[4:32:24] Fastburn_: I would say something, but it's too soon.
