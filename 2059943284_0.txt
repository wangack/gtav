[7:54:21] MambaChronos: I think may can still be cool with mary and most members but not in the group
[7:54:27] IraExitium: i think a 1 on 1 between May and Mary could help things
[7:54:35] IraExitium: when they aren't heated
[7:55:01] reldnahc_the_ascendant: Clueless
[7:55:07] SevenIn7: It was bad

[7:55:28] theplaguedcrow1: shit I read that wrong I picked yuh
[7:55:30] cody_2k17: I think the relationship can be fixed but I don't see member TBH

[7:56:20] IraExitium: what Scar said nodd
[7:56:22] SevenIn7: May handed in her flag and they took it as May leaving
[7:56:27] ineff86: I think the relationship with the people can be saved but I don't see her staying in the gang after that.
[7:56:32] SevenIn7: When she wasn't sure
[7:56:56] oliviaawoo: May after a week just says sorry and peepoShy Mary and JJ OMEGADANCE
[7:56:57] ScarIsKing: cant make everyone happy though thats just life nodd
[7:57:10] SevenIn7: I'm sure May can can repair stuff personally but gang life donzo
[7:57:13] SevenIn7: Even with JJ
[7:57:24] iyarpi: Thats the same in every group tho.
[7:57:28] MedusaMidnight: no such thing as a perfect situation
[7:57:37] SwagnificentTG: KC just has such high expectations and May is never gonna be what they want her to be. She can still always be their friend and work with her.
[7:57:39] IraExitium: less doom, more HOPIUM
[7:58:01] AkuShin_: relationships can be saved but probably not the gang stuff, specially after talking about it with siz and erin
[7:58:04] MedusaMidnight: I think May and Mary work better as sisters than as subordinate/leader
[7:58:07] SevenIn7: Now Mary can just be a sister and not a leader
[7:58:19] Tronno: Depends on where May goes, I think
[7:58:32] SevenIn7: Also time to make that official monkaChrist adoption fraud
[7:58:45] SwagnificentTG: Mary cares so much about May but May is never gonna be the person Mary wants as a second in command
[7:58:51] ScarIsKing: even before may joined KC you were talking about may not wanting to be under mary anymore, so it kinda works out if thats the way it goes nodd
