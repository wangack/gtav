[5:01:33] devintalktech: well that's not fair, I do cool shit, it's just not this kind of stuff lol
[5:02:38] xsetbv: you still have two clients there
[5:02:46] xsetbv: can you play anims on a ped you don't own
[5:02:56] xsetbv: or do you force ownership transfer
[5:03:12] Skyrossm: need to play on the owners client
[5:03:18] Skyrossm: and pop will be owned by grid owner?
[5:03:39] devintalktech: can y'all see the code and I'm just blind or do y'all have working knowledge LUL
[5:03:52] Skyrossm: sinnnn-cere
[5:03:54] LukeT360: Is the other ped dead cutting off ability to command animations?
[5:05:08] Skyrossm: I gave up on trying to swap ownership of net entities ever and just re-create them on the client that needs ownership
[5:05:20] Skyrossm: 10x easier and more reliable lmao
[5:05:45] xsetbv: if population is involved you have nearly zero chance anyways sky
[5:05:55] 360ski: What is the underlying issue with Cornwood and Abdul's ped as far as limitations to thier clothes?
[5:06:02] xsetbv: internally it will instantly try to claim ownership again
[5:06:06] Skyrossm: yeah even script owned objects though would randomly re-assign a frame or two after creation
[5:06:22] Skyrossm: super weird
[5:06:38] Skyrossm: server would maek it on client a, so i send creation and attach to client a but client b woudl take ownership in time
[5:06:55] Skyrossm: requesting didnt even work, we dont use requestControlFilters so it wasnt settling
[5:07:29] 360ski: dragonxVibes dragonxVibes dragonxVibes dragonxVibes dragonxVibes dragonxVibes
[5:07:35] xsetbv: Well, maybe thats solved soon
[5:07:41] SupahBlah: FrogDance
[5:07:42] xsetbv: at least for non population
[5:07:59] Skyrossm: if you're using np-sync the native might need to be added to the list of allowed ones?
[5:08:30] Skyrossm: @xsetbv i was told that force entity ownership had 0% chance of being merged omegalul
[5:08:49] Skyrossm: unless the issues are fixed... PogChamp
