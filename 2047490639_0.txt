[3:37:17] spookyghost21: shocking its gone .......
[3:37:18] JakeStratic: Nah, not P.D.s fault. The reality is it doesn't matter if you're a Navy Seal. If someone is willing to unprovoked and without care for their own life walk up behind you and pull the trigger. You're going to die.

[5:01:29] catloyalist: Rivers would of been more dedicated than even cornwood is. Its a loss is the only reason im sad it isnt seen. He actually stayed professional and quiet during the Acadamy. Its just unfortunate he isnt liked.
[5:01:33] RexPappa: @RexPappa OMEGALUL X2
[5:01:35] pkwhiz: its cause cornwood took the day off
[5:01:36] impanda0: also because everyone is standing on a roof meeting

[5:02:09] TJFOOL: crims know cops can't stop them, free guns lol
[5:02:09] mizzikk2401: @catloyalist so far I understood he broke a core rule
[5:02:13] 0zarruu: Cops need to step it up if this is going to happen, crims know cops aren't doing anything
[5:02:17] Nickomongo: @catloyalist why isn’t he liked? I came in late
[5:02:20] lizardeyes: oh wow
[5:02:21] Spired12: they kinda know they can walk all over pd
[5:02:24] TheKingOfWit: i think it's cause they're solo, what do you do when you just have a knife on you and no backup
[5:02:30] Ned15: Oof yeah it's the 3rd gun with Aldo's
[5:02:32] catloyalist: @mizzikk2401 It wasnt a rule he was aware of.

[5:03:01] Graudenzo: @catloyalist The flipside is he could be a giga brain crim. Imagine, building up a bunch of cash in G6, becoming a police recruit, buying a whole bunch of guns with the weapons license, and then selling them black market after getting rejected
[5:03:08] Leritt: what the meeting is about ? was afk
[5:03:09] Hitcher_TV: honestly cops being loot pinatas is going to cause cops to not want to come on duty

[5:03:45] WineNot: why don’t cops just starting selling guns to crims, problem solved
[5:03:48] TheKingOfWit: @Leritt I haven't seen the whole thing, but they were discussing cadets from the academy

[5:36:24] BelllGoR: can't you have cops not ride solo for now?
[5:36:24] javifarms: thats not a bad idea
[5:36:25] jennindf: thats true
[5:36:26] GwanStruan: Or go full UK no guns until a raid or guns are on the street
[5:36:26] KDRaid: that car is sick
[5:36:27] goodguy2434: crims will ' learn that meta ' an thats it
[5:36:29] Loco_Cubano: @Ssaab carry 8 guns like Cornwood Kappa
[5:36:30] urkuri92: yep,only works once LUL
[5:36:30] iLigandTV: that's what cornman's arsenal is for NODDERS
[5:36:30] Kunarklive: @Ssaab what about enforcing some kinda 21 foot rule
[5:36:31] azncheesy: Free 2 gun LUL
[5:36:31] sneaky_snake__: or put a 2nd officer in the trunk and pull them out when you get robbed
[5:36:35] Kalious78: Lol really? Allowing them to shoot without fear of being fired might help, and rolling with partners as well
[5:36:35] iMoore_: then everyone gonna be after the cars to lockpick and loot
[5:36:35] neft39157: Next thing you know crime are gonna be the one to get shot on soon; just wait and see
[5:36:35] downtowncrownn: ocean dump them right after Pog
[5:36:35] tofuhai: cops just need to have their gun out 24/7 and not be unfocused
[5:36:36] Firehead94: today has been :lit: IMO
[5:36:36] KoppaVRP: Get the silent alarms back whilst numbers are low
[5:36:36] sixoddeight: no solo cops
[5:36:37] Chavalin: Cornwood 4 guns solution
[5:36:38] pol_pol_pol: jean paul krakening a cop car finds a free gun LuL
[5:36:38] KillaKH0le: Sheisty got his gun saved a few times by having the gun in the lock box
[5:36:39] jennindf: true
[5:36:39] theblackdog808: Dammed if you do dammed if you don't type of thing
[5:36:40] TXCVulture: then another in the box LETSGO
[5:36:41] sixoddeight: NO SOLO COPS
[5:36:42] ArdentCause: Its RP and cops vs crims - this will happen
[5:36:42] currychicken1234567: bro how does an  how did an officer get there gun robbed inside of mrpd  @s
[5:36:42] moto432: just ocean dump the crims KEKW
[5:36:43] Satic: Then you put two guns in the lockbox
[5:36:43] Ravionus: are you not able to hold your gun in the holster?
[5:36:43] GwanStruan: If cops have no guns nothing to rob
[5:36:47] SammytheQueen: just always be holding a gun, problem solved
[5:36:47] MisterParry: tbh cops should default to having their guns locked up. I don't think I've seen a single time a cop has shot their gun to stop crime
[5:36:48] woolfdesign: I have an idea. Make it illegal to steal
[5:36:48] Chadwick1: @Ssaab  why not just make PD guns decay in 12 hours.  Cops eqiup up when they start their shift
[5:36:50] BaitIHaveUlt: NOT BOBBY SAJ

[5:36:55] mrpepino01: Need to take the Frank Reynolds approach
[5:36:56] Chaoszero_goc: is there a rule againist having more than one gun? could cops choose to have a locked back up?
[5:36:56] pluck_it: Snr buns policy to never be alone there

[5:37:02] woolfdesign: Yes
[5:37:02] goodguy2434: IDK
[5:37:02] FLCK3R: like fanny started rp in 4.0 and she is amazing,only people who do this are the ones who played before
[5:37:03] moodymellow: that should be a deterrent then, IRL police have MASSIVE guns in the car for situations like that
[5:37:04] ArdentCause: dont take a shit at snr buns duh
[5:37:04] Potato_Nation19: Cops should have situational awareness.... the "you cant shoot till its too late" concept is crap.
[5:37:05] EsfandTV: cornwood carries 8 guns and walks around with his gun out and 40k in cash and two turbos and doesn’t get robbed because they know better
[5:37:05] Abduleon_: shit on the crim
[5:37:06] tofuhai: dont take a shit at snr buns?
[5:37:07] jessielight: nothing you can do
[5:37:07] Zhang_1888: diapers

[5:37:12] MisterParry: Maybe don't shit where you eat
[5:37:12] sneaky_snake__: diapers
[5:37:12] Vincheti: Devs need to make  anti bonk and stab gear so they can atleast survive the first attack to react @Ssaab
[5:37:12] Not_Serious: @danny_yel I'm not talking about the cops as much as the crims.  The cops are getting burnt out because they're the only ones that face discipline that affects their roleplay and their enjoyment of the game
[5:37:13] Percolatorx: wait someone else just got robbed?
[5:37:15] Rossshki: stealing PD stuff seems to be on the rise, but still a crime of opportunity
[5:37:15] orange51611: throw shit at them
[5:37:15] coldan01: @EsfandTV, EZ
[5:37:16] MDM4ever1986HD: OMEGALUL

[5:37:16] TexanRampage92: Mag dump then ocean dump jk
[5:37:16] JC9R_: or maybe when you actually catch them with pd equipment send them to jail for longer than  10 minutes
[5:37:16] Kunarklive: nah in that case it is what it is
[5:37:17] feranmixy: shoot the thief and ocean dump them, after that arest them when they wake up lol
[5:37:17] Bassoumba: do it for the rp
[5:37:19] pluck_it: didnt communicate well
[5:37:20] RoninGundam: have a partner holding your hand in the bathroom

[5:37:21] EsfandTV: I’m memeing
[5:37:21] BoogieAnimal: Do getting robbed on the toilet would be so funny/terrible LUL
[5:37:22] sixoddeight: the solution is always more guns

[5:37:24] afroakatsuki: @EsfandTV eggyKKona
[5:37:24] JokersRansom: @EsfandTV TRUE
[5:37:27] VeteranClacky: could ammo be stopped being sold to the public?
[5:37:27] TheMah1337: aziz was talking to the mayor about making crime illegal, i think that would help
[5:37:28] DanLGG: exactly. then a ems or judge gets held up and demands the gun from lock storage.
[5:37:29] Deviii_: @EsfandTV CORNMAN
[5:37:29] RexPappa: @EsfandTV gotta let em know EZ
[5:37:29] FLCK3R: @EsfandTV yea but cornwood is good friends with criminals KEKW
[5:37:30] Crizack: @EsfandTV KEKW 󠀀

[5:37:31] Ned15: Chat cops carrying 2 guns is dumb, crims will say open it all LuL
[5:37:33] slimbrady0_0: @EsfandTV Clueless
[5:37:35] Nerdversity: @Ssaab im happy i found you man, to watch stream, you guys as PD get shit on more then i did as a MP
[5:37:38] shotsfired911: Im enjoying the rp :)
[5:37:42] ArdentCause: True cornwood is an anomaly - gets taken hostage and somehow it turns into a sbs scenario LMFAO
[5:37:42] sspungg: just pull the gun out and go Rambo
[5:37:43] scooberdooberty: @esfandtv the only way to rob Cornwood is to play on his patriotism like the clowns did lmao
[5:37:46] FinexLive: @Ssaab what do you think of having a limit of distance between solo cops? might help a little
[5:37:46] woolfdesign: Have a list of Shoot On Site people
[5:37:46] LeZenon: @EsfandTV KKona damn right brother
[5:37:49] Paxipher: @Ssaab they're also not in your position
[5:37:50] PsychoJoker: esfandCOPS Clap let em know
[5:37:51] woolfdesign: Sight even
[5:37:56] Honorspren: i cant help but think this is Archer's fault for some reason
[5:37:57] goodguy2434: THERE IS NO WAT TO PREVENT SPONTANISEST ROBBERIES PERIOD.
[5:37:59] itisacar: CBT Cornwoods Bargain Turbos
[5:37:59] RexPappa: This is super fun man, not saying otherwise
[5:38:00] Kfoo_: I like the concept of cops getting robbed as a rallying cry to other cops to chase that fucker down
[5:38:02] sspungg: it’s your life or there’s just go Rambo
[5:38:03] EsfandTV: OOC Cornwood being there doesn’t do anything… IC, hell I told y’all esfandCOPS
[5:38:04] Rossshki: so long as cops are stilll having fun in their RP is there really a problem?
[5:38:05] Rockshock: What I think the server needs is certain safe zones. Like the PD for example should be a no crime safe zone honestly.
[5:38:06] 1CaptainRedBeard1: Honestly, best answer is to take the guns out of cop hands and simply mount them on the cars. M2 mounted CVPIs
[5:38:06] Vincheti: Cops should be able to survive two stabs change my mind
[5:38:08] Paxipher: @Ssaab theyre not in your position so they dont know how its like
[5:38:08] Kfoo_: its good RP
[5:38:09] hosseinfel: It seems you cant control anything at all
[5:38:10] goodguy2434: just like irk
[5:38:12] TimmayHS: a lot of us don't have any clue what RP is really like when you're doing it - I logged into the NoPixel public server the other day and it was SO difficult to even learn the mechanics @Ssaab
[5:38:14] ArdentCause: LMFAOOOOOOO

[5:38:35] PandaNomsBamboo: clip?
[5:38:36] mkonieczek: ask him
[5:38:37] djanik31: how is Ramee saying "he was just trolling" when he pointed out it was Peanut is an actual defense
[5:38:38] RobialT: Whos been robbing cops today? Adam Sandler or Samuel L Jackson?
[5:38:39] ArdentCause: lol probably the dsync

[5:38:46] ixpops: ramee being ramee
[5:38:46] VicOnTop: i mean ooc, it was a SHITSHOW
[5:38:46] DeadlyCupid93: sitt hi

[5:38:48] inducedcatharsis: SHITSHOW
[5:38:49] BoogieAnimal: They respect the Cornmans esfandCOPS  @EsfandTV
[5:38:50] f0rbin: ramee's never telling the truth
[5:38:51] Jimmy_Tha_Quad: it only gets more hectic from here LUL
[5:38:53] Icestruggler: he saw it and called it on the radio but no cop remembers cuz chaos i guess
[5:38:54] dopest022: can you do a gun buyback program making it worth it to turn them in ?
[5:38:55] DarrenHornsby: the cop was clueless
[5:38:55] BattleAlpaca: @EsfandTV ron mexico kidna day EZ

[5:38:56] disruptedorder: buck said it was a big guy that robbed him eh? SUS @EsfandTV
[5:38:56] Canachos: should have never taken guns out and been full melee since the start that way NO ONE has a gun
[5:38:57] CuBanMumzy: different perspectives?
[5:38:58] spicyville: damn locals
[5:38:59] zilaprime: Perhaps maybe the BEST day to miss ..
[5:39:00] SergioGZ_: chat he is not asking LULW
[5:39:00] tofuhai: he called you in the cells but you were busy in the cells getting walked over KEKL
[5:39:01] sspungg: tbh all that dude had to do was keep driving he seen everyone
[5:39:03] VicOnTop: @SharkzGG_ i mean, he left out they were holding yager up
[5:39:03] 0zarruu: Why would you ever think Ramee is telling the truth KEKW
[5:39:04] luxxen1: There was sooo much going on when he pulled up. It was really hard
[5:39:05] BoogieAnimal: @Ssaab I wonder if it was a server bug?
[5:39:06] usakobun: ramee is always lieing he’s a lawyer
[5:39:06] Kalious78: Anyone got the clip of Johnson pulling up to Grove St saying g fuck that n leaving?
[5:39:08] Kenpokesbarbie: We need Sheriff Eli back
[5:39:10] danny_yel: @Not_Serious being a cop is a privilege. you have access to unique roleplay that holds power. should be different standard imo
[5:39:11] sixoddeight: DONT MAKE ME META
[5:39:11] Percolatorx: wait did another gun get stolen?
[5:39:12] Chaoszero_goc: ramee a sly mfer
[5:39:13] EmilTuT: Anybody know if bobby streams?
[5:39:14] Nerdversity: wait till all the gun fights, that are about ot happen with all the guns
[5:39:15] spookyghost21: He was telling the truth from a certain point of view Kappa
[5:39:16] Ned15: !meta
[5:39:16] R3d_Gum: The thing is cleetus know how to talk interact and rp with ppl so he's respected
[5:39:16] JC9R_: ramee's character should not be trusted by pd
[5:39:16] StreamElements: Please do not meta in chat, which means do not tell Saab stuff happening in RP that his character would otherwise not know.
[5:39:17] Smash388: is there leeway in the NVL rule for a police officer to be able to pull their gun is someone brings a gun to a knife fight?
[5:39:18] jessielight: Ramee's a lawyer truth is relative
[5:39:19] Coreytries: he also didn’t see someone get beat up right under him when watching Mary’s shop lol
[5:39:20] SharkzGG_: @VicOnTop i was talking about what the officer could see when he arrived not the whole situation
[5:39:21] chakzakchak: Big C not here to prevent terrorism
[5:39:24] 1CaptainRedBeard1: So wait. Like 5 guns are stolen now?
[5:39:25] TeejayOCE: @emiltut Shiny
[5:39:26] Laeret: do pd have silent alarms? to notify other cops
[5:39:27] VicOnTop: @SharkzGG_ ah yea
[5:39:28] DaymanF0TNM: I think a majority of officers in the same situation would have had the same result
[5:39:32] xolision: I think to increase PD enjoyment and efficiency, PD should try to pit and escalate to stop chases quicker. so its more people getting punished for not trying to rp it out in  a stop. @Ssaab
[5:39:33] kratoids: jump!
[5:39:33] s0stin: OOC johnson missed it by 1 sec but ramme saw him for like 3 secs
[5:39:34] theblackdog808: T
[5:39:37] Paxipher: careful o.o
[5:39:37] inducedcatharsis: Here we go
[5:39:40] Ned15: @Laeret not atm
[5:39:46] ShadowedSeraphim: Part of the problem there's not a whole lot police can do to stop a criminal from walking up and pulling out a knife on a cop.  They can't realistically watch everything while on call.  Buddy system is only decent prevention imo
[5:39:47] Ned15: ICANT

[5:54:08] juicymattison: They are CHOOSING to commit that crime under their own power
[5:54:09] DanLGG: bait car is definitely not entrapment. cops do it all the time with drug dealers where I live. It’s their way of saying we know, now don’t mess up

[5:58:03] lizardeyes: saabBat
[5:58:06] Steelhuf: @Ssaab you pay rent to a company with a lot of investors not one individual
[5:58:06] Doqx42: Just get a judge to say F the system there is no conflict due to shortage of property owners like the lawyers conflict lol
[5:58:06] Zelaphiel: Think that is why he got Cletus to invest and the other cops to live in one of his houses?
[5:58:08] XRICyclone: pd pent house
[5:58:12] Cultivated: CANT YOU TELL THEM TO DNA TEST IT
[5:58:13] bajbae: @bajbae crane told ramee there is no conflict of interest because there aren't enough lawyers

[6:01:19] riftshadow: PD is doing great, considering how hard it is to set it up and get it running.
[6:01:20] mochalex: the PD needs Ellie
[6:01:20] dotslashdata: @steven_even853 ssaab is entertaining

[6:01:26] MeestahJahn: its also easier being a slhitlorf
[6:01:27] nookza: either way its produced some entertaining RP
[6:01:27] HavocusRex: PD is the easiest target, and the main adversary of most people's "muh streamer"
[6:01:27] Wallsh_: CRIMS/CIVS have no idea what goes into PD work
[6:01:28] lurvethecake: FirstTimeChatter2
[6:01:31] Zhachi1250: Going to take a long time to build a solid PD up to where you want it
[6:01:31] claiiborn: the whole ems frisk thing was iffy but other than that it was cool
[6:01:33] Ikilledkenny91: @ssaab I think it's the amount of paperwork and needing evidence this version crimes aren't used to and expect you to act quicker
[6:01:34] steven_even853: we need more good officers on the force like @extraemily

[6:01:40] lookingfornothinghere: PD response time was insane but they all stood back and nobody chased the other Party @ssaab viv did great with frisk
[6:01:41] icantremember3: Pd should be given the benefit of doubt since their numbers are very bad atm

[6:01:43] 04jetta: Until you sit in that seat, your perspective is not the same. There are positives as the Captain said, things aren't perfect but they are working towards improving.
[6:01:43] Spired12: you basically are
[6:01:43] KYslippy: can you hire a PI with video cam?

[6:01:45] imnotyourdude: You got it rough my dude
[6:01:45] Coreytries: do you honestly feel people treat k and ramee like they’re still their crim selves and not the new 4.0 characters? Even tho they’re clean record and all now? @ssaab

[6:01:47] idab71: things are going good just keep on the rp. and have fun
[6:01:47] FizzDidThis: SHITSHOW absolutely
[6:01:49] dudemanbroo: if PD was 100% functional from the start there wouldnt be good RP
[6:01:50] zumanesta: I think PD just rushes to much. You tell them to slow down i think it would be alot better @Ssaab
[6:01:51] Graudenzo: Honestly, Its crazy to me that you can manage IC, OOC, and Chat all at the same time all day. Feel like I woulded be frustrated all the time
[6:01:51] GonBonkin: Corpa
[6:01:52] gatsymphony00: PD is tough because you guys usually are the RP facilitators so you cant just insta shoot people etc
[6:01:52] Mascaron: I think crims are going to do everything they can to get away with it (i.e. blaming PD and calling them corrupt). OOC you're doing fine
[6:01:53] lizardeyes: moofrappy
[6:01:53] jennindf: its hard but the crims are pretty sloppy lol they just go 10000 mph doing all this crazy stuff
[6:01:53] williamwildcat: crims can barely keep a group of 6 together. how many officers are you holding together? 30? 50?
[6:01:54] MarsCons: you are
[6:01:54] itisacar: 9th Company Member slacks? PauseChamp
[6:01:54] Jaster_Reylu: when does teh PD get someone higher ranked than captain
[6:01:55] darkmit0: are u with the union ?
[6:01:56] luxxen1: I think the way MrK and Ramee talked to Ruth was borderline harassment.

[6:02:04] banescross12: Do you get paid enough for this stress? @Ssaab
[6:02:04] EPiQ: the amount of hours that go into NoPixel businesses are like that for sure
[6:02:05] scooberdooberty: CEO of a company with his fellow CEOs trying to take the company in their own directions

[6:02:08] dotslashdata: bcso gonna be SHITSHOW
[6:02:10] opus_: i dont know how you guys do all this shit and write these reports. sounds like such a chore
[6:02:11] cjohno20: It felt like "rushing" the GSR on K took all the attention off the other party. Not necessarily bad or good, but it definitely changed the scene
[6:02:12] Matuzak_: when you can see every point of view its easy to see whats going on and its good that ssaab is trying to figure it out
[6:02:12] Matrix8369: I think the PD have the hardest job in the city. Mad respect.

[6:02:20] baron2001_: rameeChamp rameeChamp rameeChamp rameeChamp rameeChamp
[6:02:21] Ikilledkenny91: @ssaab I think it's the amount of paperwork and needing evidence in 4.0 that crimes aren't used to and expect you to act quicker
[6:02:21] BrokegamerMJM: real talk trying to tell seasoned Rp veterans how to do things is like telling Tom Brady how to throw a football when you have no experience
[6:02:24] lane9988: who are we staking ouut?

[6:02:29] ExtraEmily: peepoPolice
[6:02:30] RicoLoco52: Crims and others are out there playing fun make-believe. Cops are playing psuedo-Life
[6:02:31] shmeeso: Isn't the problem that the PD is trying to be realistic but Crims can do things without real percussions?
[6:02:32] Tuneshootin23: @imarivtv only the long way
[6:02:33] Angel_ofMercy: remember this is just a chapter not the whole book

[6:02:38] TimmayHS: I didn't know about you until recently from watching esfand, but I've really enjoyed your RP this last month @Ssaab
[6:02:39] zumanesta: rushing is the number one problem in the PD
[6:02:39] sspungg: I will say the first person that was on Seen everyone an just had to call out what he seen an chased the cars that did shoot but seems like he had to stop an take info an by that time there long gone
[6:02:40] SilentStormAU: @lane9988 your faviourite streamer

[6:03:24] Damnitben: Do you consider the robberies today as loot boxing ? chatterboxOfficer
[6:03:24] cjohno20: I think if cops focused on collecting more hard evidence through stakeouts and investigations charges would be much easier to push
[6:03:25] Marvdizzle: @Ssaab Is there a procedure at crime scenes to break off if other things are happening? Like a "first to arrive / last to leave" kind of thing?
[6:03:26] Cultivated: So will be peanut invested into anymore for robbing a cop

[6:03:50] KYslippy: can't get upset at a cop for bodycams being off if they don't want to turn on stream
[6:03:51] wavep987: I would love IC body cams on vests. So they only come out in violent situations.
[6:03:56] m0strated: Secret pouch for 2nd gun

[8:33:50] Kevz95: @bloodwayg to the WL server that slacks plays on? very. to the public servers, its possible.
[8:34:19] max6speed: Do they have people working for n the prison?
[8:34:21] greyjulian: @lookingfornothinghere we also know the clowns will be back, it incentivizes them sharing info again

[8:54:35] lehmaozer: @ssaab did a idea ever come to you like since they robbed you at ur doorstep you can rp having cctv at doorstep to further investigate mask outfit etc
[8:54:59] ToxiccLadd: so is there just no fix for the current state of all sides being frustrated with PD having to provide burden of proof?
[8:55:32] DanLGG: has no pixel always been guilty beyond a reasonable doubt or lowered the burden of proof to more than likely
[8:55:53] buddha_hands: @ToxiccLadd ?? that's just the american justice system lol

[8:56:59] Eddie1225: OMEGALAUGHING
[8:57:34] ToxiccLadd: @buddha_hands I mean true but in rp with people playing crims it can get frustrating for them too cause the "cat" in cat in mouse cant really do much atm so they kinda have to just twiddle their thumbs sometimes
[8:57:53] doggensteinn: if police do a good job criminals complain. if police do a bad job everyone complains including criminals who are snitching
[8:58:00] ToxiccLadd: ^
[8:58:00] StreamElements: What they said saabThat
[8:58:12] jersey_jesus: What's Duncan's take? Hmmm
[8:58:24] AntetokounmpoFreak: reesie3WsInChat ?
[8:58:35] lookingfornothinghere: I mean even boosting seems bad for PD bc they only see trespassing calls and PD will call off the chase and rinse and repeat
[8:58:40] lightwarrior2088: irl many crimes stay unsolved
[8:58:40] ToxiccLadd: there is no perfect balance for it which sucks but also makes it great for rp cause it just breeds drama
[8:58:47] jersey_jesus: OMEGALAUGHING
[8:58:50] lightwarrior2088: is what it is
[8:59:03] Ten_Ju: thats player thrown object that turns into trash because its old
[8:59:08] lightwarrior2088: why cant you have a officer on duty at Senor Buns
[8:59:13] iitoxii: I believe the PD has been in a tough spot for a while now, hopefully, things get better given the evolving nature and recent developments across the town.
[8:59:16] buddha_hands: PD definitely needs more teeth that's true @ToxiccLadd but people bitch either way yeah lol the same ways people want cops to succeed are the ways they don't want used against themselves
[8:59:26] greyjulian: @toxiccladd yeah, seeing chats on fire proves the RP is good since so many VIEWERS are passionate about other people’s game play
[8:59:28] riri671: it’s ok we hear cornwood too
[8:59:30] yaPPer808: it would be nice if they had more tools to investigate and or surveil
[9:00:07] doggensteinn: tbh you got the most crap thrown at you in one day ive seen. usually cornwood, mcnulty, turner, sheisty are helping but today was a perfect storm of crime
[9:00:14] Artsii1994: @yaPPer808 they have a casing systems thats in the works that will hopefully come soon and other things.

[9:01:03] yaPPer808: @greyjulian yeah im fine with the pace but it just makes it hard to get enough evidence right now

[9:03:14] yaPPer808: the thing i dont get is civs are supposed to not fight back if they are held up at gun point even if they feel like they will die anyway, but if its cops holding the guns it suddenly is ok to run for crims

[9:34:44] Eddie1225: he actually says it twice
[9:34:48] thermalnemisis1: That is why snitching is an option. one side is playing the civ role and the other isnt

[9:40:11] buddha_hands: that's exactly the problem with what marys side chose to do earlier
[9:40:26] yaPPer808: self defense is an affirmative defense
[9:40:28] Ned15: Yeah it's on the person to prove it was self defense
[9:40:29] moreperfectchan: ew ur guys self defense laws are dog haha
[9:40:30] 3xevilx: @buddha_hands interesting point
[9:40:39] Bill_Collector: That's easy to get around anyway you can just lie
[9:40:42] import_rcr: It sucks it seems so much effort to NOT be 3.0 PD for  fears of some sort of
[9:40:43] GwanStruan: You can't contact police when your life is in danger so if they show up right as it happens I think they could still claim SD
[9:40:49] eqnjn: Self defense but only if you risk incriminating yourself with poor articulation LUL
[9:40:55] nationas: they need to give a statement is how i read it

[9:41:04] tftgoat69: how do you inform the cops, when you get shot and downed with 1 shot or stabbed
[9:41:05] nationas: legally
[9:41:07] Ned15: @gwanstruan they have to run and call police if they can
[9:41:10] tftgoat69: or getting held hostage
[9:41:11] jollypnda: if they are a witness there is no obligation to talk to police
[9:41:42] GwanStruan: @ned15 fair enough but I still feel there is room to argue you were not safe yet
[9:41:53] Lord_Machiavellian: That's not how that works, Cornwood
[9:41:57] Bill_Collector: Shouldn't they be entitled to a lawyer at that point
[9:41:59] GwanStruan: But I guess it is scenario dependent
[9:42:01] jollypnda: the obstruction law is written not great to be honest
[9:42:05] jollypnda: isnt
[9:42:11] Ned15: @gwanstruan 100%
[9:42:17] Pastel_Spell: but is not actively helping legally the same as intentionally hindering?
[9:42:25] Xenoheart_Prime: You are not obligated to self incriminate yourself.

[9:43:16] ogzzzz: isn't that how 5th amendment works?
[9:43:35] buddha_hands: you don't have to self incriminate but if it's incriminating then it's not self defense is it OMEGALUL
[9:43:38] Joebowlr21: you have to have proof IE video/photo of them their at the time... then it can be obstruction
[9:43:39] Bill_Collector: Sounds like entrapment

[9:44:21] SystemCollapsed: Why not ask a judge?
[9:44:39] metal_gear_breakfast: cornwood is talking about crims taunting cops, not cops forcing them to say anything
[9:44:42] Pheyerus: 100% valid = I don’t recall.
[9:44:45] Ned15: I think Rhodes just found the solution
[9:44:47] Ned15: Holy

[9:45:02] Lepaca: Rhodes will find a petty loophole LUL
[9:45:05] rclemon_: KEKW

[9:45:20] tftgoat69: you can't force people to take the stand
[9:45:21] yaPPer808: people can just say they dont remember
[9:45:25] jollypnda: forcing people to talk to cops through threats of charges would be a fast way to have the population hate cops
[9:45:27] Bill_Collector: Cops should just worry about the basics like actually apprehending the criminals first
[9:45:29] Jibry: Rhodes is really good of finding loopholes true
[9:45:30] adamcolas: thank you turner
[9:45:32] Bill_Collector: Lol
[9:45:34] Ned15: Just charge assault with a deadly 100%

[9:45:53] zipcodelive: Theory crafting is fun
[9:46:04] ItsAHazardLife: This sounds like (with limited officers) that it will end up with a lot of bench trials. So would just be wasted time.
[9:46:05] Bill_Collector: Cooked ass hypothetical
[9:46:19] kiwiiyo: crime simcraft Nodgers
[9:46:49] metal_gear_breakfast: if some random civ rolls up to the PD and says "I know who committed a murder and have proof, but I wont tell you," would they get obstruction?
[9:46:49] Bill_Collector: Demanding respect through an iron fist is certainly an approach
[9:46:57] chivvyy: he's right NODDERS
[9:47:05] Beedle: esfand's audio is going through his mic LUL
[9:47:07] reddishtrain: LUL
[9:47:08] eqnjn: No judge would greenlight an obstruction of justice charge just for a suspect or witness abstaining to testify in police questioning.
[9:47:21] sirtoxicx: "I'm not snitching" = I know what happened but will not cooperate. I like how Cornwood is cooking

[9:47:47] daniel01927291: if they committed a crime can’t they plead the 5th whenever without obstructing
[9:47:59] Pastel_Spell: curious what DOJ will say about it tbh
[9:48:00] ogzzzz: now im curious.. if a witness makes up a fake story, is that also obstruction then?
[9:48:03] jollypnda: this would be an easy win for a lawyer to throw out witness based evidence on dockets
[9:48:07] Lord_Machiavellian: They'd need to be subpoenaed by a judge
[9:48:11] metal_gear_breakfast: nut their big mouth already committed the crime when they say they dont snitch

[9:48:15] buddha_hands: just police better cornwood 4Head
[9:48:28] Joebowlr21: coercing a witness will look really bad on the pd if it goes to bench
[9:48:29] nationas: LUL
[9:48:32] eqnjn: This is a circumstance that would only be arguable up until it actually goes to trial, it's bad practice, practically stacking
[9:48:42] yaPPer808: @ogzzzz id think there would be a false report charge
[9:49:12] yaPPer808: or perjury if it was under oath
[9:49:20] metal_gear_breakfast: so if everyone in the city was a crim the pd couldnt get any witnesses or accounts...
[9:49:23] jersey_jesus: classic Rhodes
[9:49:28] tftgoat69: they can plead 5th on stand, even if they're summoned
[9:49:33] Pheyerus: Ppl can unwillingly/accidentally be witnesses that never wanted to be involved. Threatening witnesses with obstruction puts them at risk of their own safety of a crim now targeting them.
[9:49:34] PepperAnn131: It's really splitting hairs now.
[9:49:41] adamcolas: classic
[9:49:51] Bill_Collector: If you could simply charge someone with a felony for potentially not articulating accurately in a tense situation, cpt slacks would be in prison for life
[9:50:05] Ahhlure: As a US citizen your supposed to give info of criminal activity if you have it. that’s breaking a law if not.
[9:50:08] robertsmithjr: my its the smartass side of me talking, at least if its a male, if they say we dont talk to ops, my response would be, i would look them in the eye and say "Well son i hope you've got your affairs in order because i see how you'e doing on your own and its not lookin so hot bub
[9:50:11] reddishtrain: LUL
[9:50:21] cjohno20: the last thing you need is for lawyers to know there are officers using the threat of obstruction charges to compel witnesses to give statements NotLikeThis
[9:50:24] buddha_hands: @tftgoat69 true even if they're forced to trial they can uphold their rights
