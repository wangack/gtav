Now telling you this, I wish you good luck in this endeavor
[1:13:07] djiliii_02: Beautifull wall texture
[1:13:07] isomorph_: when do you plan on admitting this is the stupidest challenge run ever? or maybe you'd like to faceroll against the wall for another 10 minutes first

[1:13:25] Hooligan06: Isn't the easiest way to just mission fail and skip. Is matto trying ot fund alternative methods?
[1:13:28] CataIana: that's a few cliops
[1:13:34] imgoodwithusernames: Riveting gameplay
[1:13:34] Sebi_XD: Maybe the virus will die of old age and you will pass the mission
[1:13:34] Fossabot: Follow me on TikTok for random funny bits: https://tiktok.com/@darkviperau
[1:13:36] manstertaco1: Its not a stupid challenge unless you don't have patience
[1:13:36] Hey_Left: LUL
[1:13:38] Jason5The4Stooge: Goodluck, please remember to Barbque Snow
[1:13:45] iamradical007: just fail 3 times and skip it
[1:13:52] big_daddy_jones224: how u been dark viper ai
[1:13:54] VojtechStrnad: can't see
[1:13:55] drinkdietmoose: What about if this requires you to do the ladder animation to progress?
[1:13:57] PuFf3rL1GhTy: @Hooligan06 that is not allowed
[1:14:00] sbeve_______: They really need to install a elevator here, terrible accessibility for wheelchairs... smh
[1:14:03] arnav_pundale: @DarkViperAU are you going to speedrun gta 6 on Console or PC?
[1:14:03] realTacitus1Kilgore: there’s a bit of water when you got out
[1:14:04] GarryGREY: @iamradical007 You could as well skip the whole game, what fun in that?
[1:14:04] TwistedxxFreedom: Try punching for a ripe below ladder.
[1:14:13] manstertaco1: It was
[1:14:15] thekapitan97: Three fail skip?
[1:14:15] TwistedxxFreedom: Try punching for right below the ladder.
[1:14:22] Hooligan06: Oh ok thanks man, this is my first stream of this run
[1:14:28] Kaspartheviewer: Maybe test before if it's like the cargo plane thing where you have to climb the last step of the ladder
[1:14:31] notfriend0: what are you doing
[1:14:33] SammyDiz: it looked like you stopped punching and it pushed through
[1:14:34] unknown_mouse7249: @drinkdietmoose like in minor turbulence
[1:14:35] iamradical007: @GarryGREY this part is pretty impossible to go through without skipping it
[1:14:36] notfriend0: ?
[1:14:39] unkn0wn_iv: Gta III Walls
[1:14:40] Hey_Left: prolly punching + 1st person + 3rd person
[1:14:41] yaboisweetnips: @isomorph_ when do you plan on… uhh…. umm… screw you >:(
[1:14:43] pedro1cy: Try mods to see if it works?
[1:14:56] broken_wrath: dviperWiggle dviperWiggle
[1:14:57] TC6126: it's not a money glitch so probably won't get patched
[1:15:03] Qaukle: maby change patch than?
[1:15:03] TizioNorbys: @isomorph_ stfu
[1:15:08] Hey_Left: or its just like the cayo perico glitch
[1:15:08] Kfestofil: i guess you need a really specific timing with a punch and camera change
[1:15:08] bigmanbrodyj: is there a reason you chose not to do this challenge on 1.27?
[1:15:18] manstertaco1: Rockstar patching story mode
[1:15:18] notfriend0: just dive up does it count or you mean pressing the space bar
[1:15:18] FluxOxklint: looks like you were diving DIRECTLY down in third person then switching, i don't think you can dive directly downwards when you are at the bottom
[1:15:22] TC6126: anything will affect their profit will get patched
[1:15:25] GarryGREY: @iamradical007 The challenge is to find a way, not to skip every part where it seems impossible. Otherwise the challenge is meaningless
[1:15:27] sorrywhatdidyousay: this feels like a red herring
[1:15:28] SammyDiz: changing cams got patched because of cayo glitches from my recolection?
[1:15:38] manstertaco1: How does story effect there profit
[1:15:50] bhavin2707: 3rd person seems better
[1:15:55] manstertaco1: Didn't Rockstar release a game 2018 they forgot about it
[1:16:02] whitewer: do these 10 steps to avoid running/jumping in a speed run... #7 will shock you
[1:16:03] jonathan_lh44: dviperDead dviperDead dviperDead dviperDead dviperDead dviperDead
[1:16:03] Hey_Left: try switch cam at the middle
[1:16:03] iamradical007: @GarryGREY so a glitch is part of the challenge then?
[1:16:08] Edmiy: Michael surprisingly has a lot of stamina
[1:16:08] ohshootimshootin: try climbing on and off a ladder
[1:16:12] mansgonemad: Switch to 3rd person while peaking outside maybe
[1:16:15] KratosTomatoes: The right wall in this area appears to be thicker, and it might be possible to clip through straight walls without necessarily going through a corner, suggesting a potential inconsistency or exploit in the game's design
[1:16:16] GarryGREY: @iamradical007 Yes
[1:16:20] GubbleButs: switch characters /s
[1:16:23] realTacitus1Kilgore: @isomorph_ looser
[1:16:24] Hooligan06: Would rotating the camera during the punch help to clip through?
[1:16:27] notfriend0: maybe
[1:16:29] chugging_beans: @TizioNorbys fr if you dont wanna watch you dont have to
[1:16:30] spaffjd: maybe check with mods first if there is even water out of bounds
[1:16:32] craigyboy420: https://clips.twitch.tv/SpunkyBrainyHumanPastaThat-Jo_6NO7j1seGdE38
[1:16:33] darkj_ev: shiiit ive missed an hour
[1:16:37] Kfestofil: @DarkViperAU when u did it you were mid a punch and changed camera to 1st person, idk how but u did, check the clip someone made it
[1:16:38] semmelon: dviperRNG
[1:16:39] TC6126: @manstertaco1 I was making a joke about how they were only patch stuff what makes money glitches
[1:16:41] bhavin2707: switching cam while punching pushed you forward
[1:17:02] iamradical007: @GarryGREY okay
[1:17:02] realTacitus1Kilgore: @darkviperau there’s like an inch of water out there
[1:17:03] iCriEvreTim: Try humming the jaws theme
[1:17:05] koen_05: Dave and Steve must be so confused
[1:17:05] big_tadds: big_tadds gifted a Tier 1 sub to spaffjd! They have given 27 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[1:17:10] Hooligan06: Punch and rotate camera 180?
[1:17:12] superspiro2: PopNemo PopNemo
[1:17:16] Hey_Left: try switch cam between punchs
[1:17:22] Leoruwer: From the clip it looks like you punched while changing camera
[1:17:22] broken_wrath: dviperWiggle dviperGlitch
[1:17:22] bhavin2707: rigged
[1:17:23] thekapitan97: But going out of boundes faild you before why are you trying it agian?
[1:17:23] manstertaco1: Du du du du
[1:17:26] TC6126: that's a really nice looking brick wall
[1:17:28] VojtechStrnad: mod time
[1:17:28] FluxOxklint: @DarkViperAU Do you know for a fact if First person hitboxes are smaller? they are right?
[1:17:33] BrentButler: 100 years might be an underestimation. lol
[1:17:33] CataIana: testing time catJAM
[1:17:34] Kfestofil: When you did it on the clip you changed camera to 1st person while starting a punch
[1:17:36] trims3: dviperDead
[1:17:37] koen_05: Chat is heling
[1:17:39] Hey_Left: science time bb dviperLove
[1:17:40] sorrywhatdidyousay: it might be just as hard to get back in bounds
[1:17:45] Caxtus2734: seems after punching then swimming forward, you head goes through.. change cam while your head goes through and see what happens
[1:17:45] doubledoublerob: didi Daveyyyyyy shoot back?
[1:17:47] MacBookPro_gaming: micheal be doing midnight swim
[1:17:50] kit25_gaming: I feel bad for voting no ladders now

[1:18:10] SammyDiz: And why are you not using 1.27?
[1:18:14] arnav_pundale: how to change patches?
[1:18:15] manstertaco1: Rdr2 has cheats but you can't use them because it doesn't let you save
[1:18:21] unknown_mouse7249: Why didn't you do this run on 1.27
[1:18:23] SrRook__: heleleloo
[1:18:26] xTheDomsterx: ain’t swimming just climbing in water
[1:18:39] Varulven93: Noone can patch Darkviperau
[1:18:40] ThirdGen87x2: @kit25_gaming I did too but it really wouldn’t have been a challenge for Matt if ladders were included
[1:18:45] smolw1tch: Stretchy boi
[1:18:46] charlie_chazzo: matt do you remember me from earlier I was looking for a charity since my dad passed and I donated 1500 to RFDS/Royal Flying Doctor Service since you couldn't think of one since I wanted to do something good
[1:18:46] trims3: Why would the out of bound water extend above the ladder tho
[1:18:48] manstertaco1: He probably wants to see if it's possible
[1:18:50] popcornchicken890: How was the McD?
[1:18:50] VojtechStrnad: long stretch
[1:18:56] Derempi50: matt did you just wake up?

[1:30:32] sheriffbigtoes1: 1
