[1:59:41] ganonbit: Onsens and bars can reject you
[1:59:41] wdgasteryoutube: Get the lockpick
[1:59:42] bumotv: Its pretty respectful to do that

[1:59:43] Gladisius: Gladisius subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! 
[1:59:46] puke_gunk: makes sense
[1:59:46] KesslerTheGuy: strangers on the internet > people you know
[1:59:47] viridesalt: Tats are more becoming more socially acceptable now but onsens might give you a hard time
[1:59:48] TinyEmbryo: are they affiliated with the yakuza

[2:10:31] Janeybees: @AutumnBomb101 Yeah he's not as diagetic as in the first game, way more scripted.
[2:10:34] theoutpost31: nemesis be serving
[2:10:42] GShogun: Nemesis is way more frightening in the original
[2:10:51] AlteredEgo11: Have you played the fixed camera ones before?
[2:10:51] Borderline_Psychotic: Nemesis was better in Marvel Vs Capcom 3
[2:10:51] Chickenfoot1282: I did the same thing, playing the original after the remake, I liked both games for their own reasons
[2:10:52] nobahelm: He was scarier
[2:10:53] lgxn7: started playing the original resident evil that game is tough
[2:10:53] GShogun: because it's relatively unpredictable
[2:11:03] ridleythestrange: Nemesis in OG never gave you time to breathe

[2:25:55] Birdlisterin3: Umbrella gave Carlos a very low caliber rifle as a joke
[2:25:55] parogg: *kills someone* "gross dude"
[2:25:56] Janeybees: It's still very likely they put potential genetics in STARS to see if they make antibodies, as again Umbrella controls the whole fuckin' town.
[2:25:59] kkierra17: paul blart mall cop zombie
[2:26:00] im_sharted: @im_sharted *got

[2:26:17] hitguy1: wait who are STARS
[2:26:17] ganonbit: I do the same
[2:26:22] Oldninjaman: It's cuz the round is smaller
[2:26:24] GShogun: it's a round that can turn your torso into bloody chunks, but it hits like a .22
[2:26:29] Megalaxis: !praise
[2:26:29] Chickenfoot1282: the round is not smaller
[2:26:29] Moobot: @Megalaxis Megalaxis Praised the cabbage! The cabbage has been praised 8175 times. (the cabbage can be praised in 5 minutes)
[2:26:32] ridleythestrange: Slayyy I am STARS

[2:26:40] daybreaker_dominator: No
[2:26:41] ganonbit: Plus it scatters if you hold it down
[2:26:45] Cyan_Tuna: 5 is smaller than 9
[2:26:46] professorh0bo: But big gun means big bullet
[2:26:47] Mothkid: @Janeybees yeah it's always more fun to come up with a possible lore reason
[2:26:48] DvlPup101: It's because the bullets are scared too
[2:26:50] Megalaxis: it’s traveling faster :)
[2:26:50] jojothemafioso: 556 is small but has a lot of pwoder, which is what makes it so lethal and effective
[2:26:51] plastiicspork: its smaller in width
[2:26:51] karriana34: the bullet technicly is smaller in 556 then 9mm
[2:26:52] Birdlisterin3: @hitguy1 STARS is basically this city's swat team. Jill is in it
[2:26:53] Ghastlygrapher: @jesse_ross in a fight?
[2:26:53] Oldninjaman: 5.56mm< 9mm
[2:26:54] SugalockHolmes: If there's one thing Charborg knows it's ammo

[2:27:09] karriana34: it just go faster
[2:27:10] thebuzz8101: NO
[2:27:11] wraxkin: it has more powder though
[2:27:11] Janeybees: @hitguy1 Special Tactics And Rescue Service (was Squad originally). Jill and Chris are original members, as was Brad and Rebecca. They were the only survivors that weren't assholes.
[2:27:12] basilfangs: it may be smaller but it has less energy
[2:27:12] ColonoscoPete: And higher velocity
[2:27:13] panzerswreck: Yes but more propellant
[2:27:13] jojothemafioso: the bullet is small but fast which is why it is efficient
[2:27:13] parogg: It's about .22
[2:27:15] thirdpersondreamer: hello Charborg
[2:27:16] Junkio33: no 556 bigger
[2:27:17] im_sharted: yeah but a lot lot more power
[2:27:18] GShogun: in terms of diameter, but the energy is much greater and it tumbles
[2:27:21] vangardai: this is a video game?!
[2:27:21] nobahelm: Smaller diameter faster velocity
[2:27:22] hey_there7525: tavels alot faster tho and pointy
[2:27:22] areeis: D: this is a video game??
[2:27:23] ScrappyDiscoDog: The bullet is smaller but there is more power behind it
[2:27:27] Oldninjaman: It goes faster
[2:27:28] GShogun: meaning it's churning your flesh as it passes
[2:27:29] nerevarineorange: Smaller, but has more velocity.
[2:27:31] DinkaFox: Did that say 43th chat message?
[2:27:31] poopdawg412: RAGEY
[2:27:31] yuler_: penetrates armor better too

[2:27:50] Chickenfoot1282: @Ladykissykins oh my god how delayed are you
[2:27:51] babybonggoblin: fuck i want another tattoo so bad
[2:27:51] Lizksy: Carlos can punch them
[2:27:51] concade: charborg those are fire extiguishers
[2:27:52] parogg: @hitguy1 They're part of the police technically. They don't know all about Umbrella yet
[2:27:54] hitguy1: @Janeybees are they from the gubberment or private?
[2:27:56] edeneye30: uh oh papa hold the door
[2:27:57] jojothemafioso: the bullet in the 5.56 cartridge is the size of a .22, but there's more gun powder
[2:27:57] play_minecraft_or_else: I throw rocks because they're bigger than most bullets and obviously that makes them do more damage
[2:27:59] usernamedeleted: 556 is a little more skinny, but it is more than double the length of 9mm
[2:28:02] McGurtt: maynbe that door aint even closed that zombie just weak
[2:28:04] Chickenfoot1282: I'll argue for you
[2:28:06] babybonggoblin: bc you love us <3

[2:28:14] Chickenfoot1282: you just focus on the stream, I'll argue with these nerds
[2:28:15] dg_mikee: Charborg is the best
[2:28:17] silly_maria: What are we arguing about?
[2:28:17] hitguy1: @parogg so jill was mad at umbrella for something else?
[2:28:19] McGurtt: Nah, I'd win.
[2:28:21] Hdgunnell: @GShogun invented bullets
[2:28:24] Oldninjaman: KKona Muh .45

[2:29:00] ridleythestrange: it's 5 times 2
[2:29:01] Oldninjaman: @dude_tranquil that 5.56 is less powerful than a 9mm
[2:29:02] prettyjumbles: 5% we think he's joking but he's serious
[2:29:03] DemDagglez: where are statistical numbers stating that its 10%?
[2:29:05] Janeybees: @Janeybees As for when it turned to 'service' was in the remakes, because it sounds kind of jarring and improper english.
[2:29:05] Salty_Drink: so whats the argument today?
[2:29:06] parogg: @hitguy1 She suspects them of being behind the attack, but Carlos isn't in on their evil plans so she is fine with working with him
[2:29:06] Chickenfoot1282: does anyone else ever read the IMFDB wiki, it's one of those sites I love reading on the toilet

[3:16:55] greaseking69: i really hope they remake re5. i LOVED re5
[3:16:59] Janeybees: You really have to play smart in some sections though. There are a few forced combat sections but outside of that no, you don't have to fight anything really.
[3:17:01] thebuzz8101: @greaseking69 didn't he beat this game with only a knife
[3:17:02] ridleythestrange: Cold Fear was another game in the RE style
[3:17:08] GShogun: eh, hope they quit with remakes after 5
[3:17:13] Vitlandos123: Why did you do that to the poor doll
[3:17:13] Birdlisterin3: I wait patiently for re6 remake
[3:17:18] greaseking69: @thebuzz8101 i believe so
[3:17:20] CaseFace5: this game's excuses for blocking paths is egregious though lol, its just a rolling bed and some portable curtains push it over

[3:17:27] charlesleebay: This games unlocks are infuriating
[3:17:30] GShogun: because i know damn well they're going to remake 5, it's just a matter of time :L
[3:17:32] sneakyninja_wr: :)
[3:17:36] greaseking69: re1 remake remake
[3:17:40] distressedcrow: I mean this is a hospital
[3:17:44] GShogun: it was like their bestselling game until monster hunter world, that's saying soemthing

[3:18:04] sashadenae: I would expect a lot of zombies in a hospital
[3:18:06] Janeybees: And RE0
[3:18:08] CaseFace5: nah the RE1 remake is an older engine. still pre-rendered backgrounds
[3:18:13] greaseking69: that zombie needs a friggin hobby
[3:18:13] Threepwind: really interested what theyll do for re5, it was a real fun coop game
[3:18:14] mossbean: @Janeybees were you allowed to use flashbangs or other nonlethal defenses?
[3:18:17] hitguy1: @Chickenfoot1282 ok i connected to 7tv via twitch log in, does it auto connect to ffz?
[3:18:20] GShogun: REmake is still timeless, too
[3:18:20] robop0: well i have re12
[3:18:25] charlesleebay: Safer you beat the game you get a bunch of challenges that basically require 3 times as long to do as the first playthrough
[3:18:29] Janeybees: @mossbean Long as they don't get shoved into a zombie, sure.
[3:18:35] GShogun: @Threepwind eh, just getting really tired of remakes, and the original RE5 still holds up well
[3:18:38] cherryro: time for a guided meditation
[3:18:40] Janeybees: A lot of it is just timing.
[3:18:43] sashadenae: and a lot of healing items in a hospital, that’s where the healing happens
