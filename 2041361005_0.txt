[0:33:25] EpicHuggles: Powerglove! It's so bad
[0:36:18] cobalt076: screws may not be as strong as a straight piece of wire. look at musky harness building wire - 0.62 wire, maybe .51 wire if it doesnt need to be as strong. a pair of round nose pliers will help you bend the wire and make it easy to add a split ring too
[0:36:33] SlinkyMcMasters: use the first one as a test for weights placement then the ones you can stop the printer and and weight as the printer goes if that makes sense

[0:38:58] NemisizZ: saw a vid that popped up in my feed where he made a 4 part mold for basically what ur doing
[0:39:18] jelogtr: what is this u designing? @travpiper
[0:41:12] cobalt076: not sure if you've gone this route but could always buy one you like and get a cheap pair of calipers from harbor freight to help dimension it and give you reference
[0:41:26] jelogtr: was that fishing bait? @travpiper
[0:41:46] jelogtr: mhm
[0:42:10] cobalt076: yeah digital is the way. I like phantom glidebaits. they are made for musky but have smaller sizes that I've crushed some big largemouth on

[2:05:28] NemisizZ: probably
[2:05:34] EpicHuggles: id be surprised if there arent
[2:05:34] Lizzkhhalifa: should be.
[2:05:40] NemisizZ: theres def a lot of services online
[2:06:00] pixeleater7: there's usually Maker Spaces in a lot of towns where you can use the 3D printers if you have a membership
[2:06:03] NemisizZ: just get a mid fdm tbh
[2:06:04] slorebear: There's a ton of same day spots in LA
[2:06:13] slorebear: I bet Austin has em too
[2:06:13] sucio71989: I imagine a place like Austin would for sure have some
[2:07:29] NemisizZ: yeah wait, learn how to use 360 right now
[2:07:29] sucio71989: any talks of them upping the doctor pay?
[2:07:40] NemisizZ: see how making molds work in it and all that
[2:08:20] NemisizZ: then get one fdm for 500 ish and do it that way, its probably gonna be the cheapest option
[2:08:36] NemisizZ: where you dont need a lot of extra like with a resin
[2:10:09] AquaJawa: AquaJawa subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months! Yeah, if you're going down the FDM printer route, there are so many options and it's a very forgiving process.
[2:10:09] StreamElements: AquaJawa just subscribed for 28 months in a row PogChamp
[2:10:28] NemisizZ: yeah
[2:10:29] slorebear: Jawa PogU
[2:10:31] Headss: Yes
[2:10:54] NemisizZ: yes and no, depends on how u wanna make it
[2:11:02] pixeleater7: I'd imagine that resin prints certainly hold up better than FDM prints in water
[2:11:07] sucio71989: gonna get any fishing streams in the near future?
[2:11:10] NemisizZ: like if you wanna make molds
[2:11:32] slorebear: Not enough pogs
[2:11:46] NemisizZ: like print the molds, then a fdm is prolly the best approach, but for the lures it self, then a resin would prolly be the way
[2:11:59] SlinkyMcMasters: too many plugs not enough pogs
[2:12:05] MarKingYo: we need drive bys at the roosters
