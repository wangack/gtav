[0:48:39] Westoffer: @HKIA they aint maffed for like 15 years
[0:48:40] Sablotron: 2000 bags (20 plants) at 17.5 per, multiplied by 0.15 is the number
[0:48:40] searlesbarkleyk: Grower should get 10 lol
[0:48:42] RainFire2: Grow cost is being ignored

[0:48:49] Karnall: @jbeazy850 makes sense for time investment though
[0:48:50] ChiefinIt: It's off of 1500 because you take off 250 for weed supllies

[0:49:04] ozarmstrong: It's 1700-300 (plant cost), you guys only split profits
[0:49:08] stormchaser16: grow costs come from house pot
[0:49:15] eddieb0822: how much do the BUTC hired ppl sell a day?

[7:50:46] mang9698: Canes?
[7:50:47] mCerti: Do you guys ever cook Harry? I know you stream mostly, but you didn’t always stream this much
[7:50:47] shortsaga: yeah SS is WAY over priced my man
[7:50:47] OriginalGibsta: Shake Shack meat is like top tier, but yeah you're just paying for the meat on a potatoe bun
[7:50:48] janessa____: fatburger
[7:50:48] smokva__: DICK'S
[7:50:49] dumpster_diner: I made a banger miso soup from scratch in like 30mins and most of that was waiting for the dashi to soak
[7:50:49] PurpleAndGold: In N out is the best quality for the price hands down
[7:50:51] PrimarySweets: Culvers?
[7:50:55] scotty2thotty18: Shake shack has a really good burger patty
[7:50:57] turbodyrock: @ktothec99 uuh cheap dicks
[7:50:59] iamwillbur: i wanna try in an out so bad man
[7:51:00] mnfoxtrot: Harry, I get it, but you need to learn to cook. Streaming, doordash, out to eat, I get it. Once you have run enough ads to buy your house, invest in a pellet smoker.
[7:51:01] mortaldictata117: Whataburger is great when you're drunk af KEKW
[7:51:03] Foenemn: Culvers is so good
[7:51:07] Iron_PTMN: in n out is trash
[7:51:09] Westoffer: people trash on in-n-out but its by far the best thing for the price. Its like the last fast food that costs what fast food should cost
[7:51:11] apache78: Dicks is still pretty cheap and their fries are good
[7:51:12] juicexgx: i can get like two burgers fries and a drink at in n out for the same price as one stand alone burger at shake shack
[7:51:15] mortaldictata117: @Iron_PTMN this
[7:51:23] shortsaga: Culvers is shit
[7:51:24] haywood_jahbloume: What burger used to be good, dog shit now, in n out sucks, Freddy's is where it's at
[7:51:27] porkx: whataburger only good when you’re fucked up tbh buddhaLUL
[7:51:30] BrainsNSpaceBacon: went to dicks onetime and i had to go to the back and fill my own drink LUL
[7:51:31] ichijazz: If anyone in chat knows whats up with Bowpicker then you know
[7:51:31] scotty2thotty18: In n out has shit for fries
[7:51:38] ktothec99: Burgermaster is pretty good as well
[7:51:39] dumpster_diner: True @mnfoxtrot ez way in
[7:51:42] luvvkoa: in n out isnt trash. people just hate it cause its popular. its pretty good but not the best
[7:51:42] juicexgx: should get a blackstone flat top those are clutch
[7:51:43] vincentlalala: you guys are crazy in n out is #1
[7:51:44] jakolope_: all the best burger places are regional
[7:51:46] buddy_green2021: As a Texan, whatabuger used to be great. Now it's trash
[7:51:48] mortaldictata117: In n out burgers are just to basic for me
[7:51:51] BaldScooter: grilled some fajitas on my blackstone tonight!
[7:51:53] mang9698: yep
[7:51:55] shortsaga: i do
[7:51:56] BrainsNSpaceBacon: dishes are a pain
[7:52:01] Thatgooey: only food i ever eat out anymore is fried chicken, because it's a pain in the ass to do at the house
[7:52:03] MrProtagonist: instapot is the play. toss stuff in, amazing meal whenever
[7:52:05] juicexgx: @mortaldictata117 yeah but its about the quality for the price
[7:52:06] haywood_jahbloume: @buddy_green2021 exactly
[7:52:06] Nightbot: Welcome to all you new viewers, if you're enjoying the stream and don't want to miss the next one, please be sure to hit that follow button! Harry will be streaming RP Monday - Friday, come enjoy the content!
[7:52:07] dumpster_diner: prefer vietnamese
[7:52:09] theoriginaltorso: @Harry have you tried Broiler Bay Burgers in Bellevue yet?
[7:52:11] tahoemac: I got a fire indian spot down the street a bit
[7:52:11] Yuusles: got a favorite thai dish?
[7:52:12] csllek: ooo i ordered thai food tonight got me some chicken satay
[7:52:13] luvvkoa: @mortaldictata117 then dont order the basic one??
[7:52:14] mang9698: pad Thai is my comfort food
[7:52:16] sodisfront: Hire a chef to meal prep for you
[7:52:16] ichijazz: Oh and BTW Bowpicker is fish and chips
[7:52:17] MrPopandhop: curry in general >
[7:52:18] Tiilde: Thai food the bestttt but its hit or miss for me cause its ... not like home cooked LOL
[7:52:19] shortsaga: what i cook is way cheaper then ordering
[7:52:20] Poison_ttv_: theres treally good korean places here too

[7:52:23] daaanielJ: mmm thai ice tea
[7:52:24] OriginalGibsta: My two favorites are Shake Shack and Freddy's. You can tell Shake Shack's beef is way better than Freddy's, but I can get a full combo at freddy's for like 11 bucks
[7:52:25] dumpster_diner: making fresh spring rolls at home is fun too
[7:52:38] apache78: Drunken noodles, rice and peanut sauce is a great combo
[7:52:40] eliteviewer77: dont ask marty for directions, never works
[7:52:54] mortaldictata117: @mortaldictata117 my main issue with them is having a "secret menu" just make good burgers ffs
[7:53:36] mnfoxtrot: You will enjoy that food way better. With the smoker you just have to step away twice for a minute in a 20 to 30 minute cook. Steak, burgers, ribs, you would like it. No clean up, perfect for a degen streamer!
[7:53:42] eddieb0822: I think you both can cut it up
[7:53:47] Thatgooey: YAPPP I never hated this car chat YAPPP This car is amazing chat YAPPP Look how good it drives
[7:53:47] porkx: it’s nice car for growing and hunting
[7:53:52] alanthat1guy: The butcher by my house makes better burgers than any chain for like >$5, I get it all the time
[7:53:52] scotty2thotty18: @mortaldictata117 its the fries for me. They barely cook them.

[7:55:12] JurazikBlazik: just moved to Texas been pretty nice
[7:55:16] Contexts_: u just gotta consider whats right for u
[7:55:17] eddieb0822: find furnished sublets to get a taste of different areas
[7:55:18] Thatgooey: I had this college professor from India once who was 91 years old, never had anything except for home cooked meals his whole life. Had been living in the US for like 50 years
[7:55:19] fenixblac: @scotty2thotty18 What's a good set and forget it option?

[7:55:47] BlacKnight2514: nah fuck cali on god
[7:55:48] ElWeto: all the seasons
[7:55:51] hjantzi: California you will go broke from the taxes
[7:55:51] CourageTheCowardIy: any Dora tonight?
[7:55:52] juicexgx: i dont like all the rules in utah
[7:55:52] skylerbean8: def not cali
[7:55:55] bigxfisch: colorado isnt bad
[7:55:56] ichijazz: I would love to live in Salt Lake but it's expensive as well
[7:55:57] skylerbean8: Texas is amazing

[7:56:03] rosco2357: Colorado would be nice
[7:56:04] jackwheel10: you seem like a Colorado guy
[7:56:05] Nightbot: PLEASE DO NOT META! Harry can only use information that his character knows in-game. Anything else is meta-gaming and won't be acted upon. If you continuously try to meta you will be timed out, or BANNED.
[7:56:06] Thatgooey: Yeah come to Texas Harry, there are no income taxes here
[7:56:08] Contexts_: ah yea
[7:56:14] fenixblac: @scotty2thotty18 yessir
[7:56:14] ichijazz: Colorado is nice (I live there) but also expensive
[7:56:15] mnfoxtrot: Dude, that is the best about buying a house. You can do anything you want to make it your own. You are right about renting. For me I got tired of listening to people scream at each other in the parking lot on the weekends and I said I'm done. If you want to explore, explore. If you want to settle down, do that.
[7:56:15] Jbwrecked: Texas goat
[7:56:20] SlaytanIbracleanabic: Alberta
[7:56:22] skylerbean8: no income tax Dallas

[8:12:47] AnaklusmosDaze: o7 luci
[8:12:52] tacostarvedbeast: siri set timer 30 minutes
[8:13:02] CourageTheCowardIy: a rooting keyboard allows you to not press the accelerator down all the way
[8:13:04] fublian: Is ZAZA pushing 60 now when noone is selling or?
[8:13:06] CourageTheCowardIy: wooting
[8:13:10] CuppaT_XYZ: peepoArriveWithEgg
[8:13:19] FamSisher: the wooting keyboard is pressure senative with its keys

[8:13:23] CuppaT_XYZ: peepoDyingFromToxicFumesReleasedFromASpraypaintCanBecauseHeWasNotWearingAMask
[8:13:43] dumpster_diner: KEKW you can do that with any mechanical keyboard, can't you?
[8:13:44] grimblymcgoo: @dumpster_diner it makes each button like a joystick where a partial depressed key is only partially input
[8:14:31] avb5545: Fishing needs to come back
[8:14:38] CuppaT_XYZ: @dumpster_diner naqh theres special keyboards that do it they are weird to use I member summit giving one a go
[8:14:52] dumpster_diner: oh, they're magnetic
[8:14:56] SadPeypey: Bear hunt Pog
[8:15:00] iiidaaah: we need FISHING Kreygasm
[8:15:04] woulf76: I was watching Swan kill sharks with her knife.
[8:15:05] ichijazz: A true mechanical KB is one click but the Wooting is pressure sensitive which allows throttle feed back with cars
[8:15:14] realitijd24: Fishing needed
[8:15:23] TheRejectsAzFTwitch: Fishing may come from hunting rep honestly
[8:15:27] Thatgooey: not pressure sensitive, actuation point reading
[8:15:29] Thatgooey: it's a mech switch
[8:15:42] Thatgooey: full depression of key = 100%, half = 50%, ect
[8:15:47] ichijazz: @Thatgooey this is the better way to describe it
[8:15:51] CuppaT_XYZ: Nerdge
[8:15:54] hmmidk17: @dumpster_diner Think of like an analog joystick but in a key for each input
[8:16:08] Thatgooey: what no, make it easier, gas pedal in a car
[8:16:19] dumpster_diner: it's not just mechanical, there's tons of those, I have like 15 types of mechanical switches. these are magnetic, so not analog like mech switches
[8:16:20] Thatgooey: you floor it, it goes full throttle, barely push the petal, not as much
[8:16:43] franciscooo25: would be cool
[8:16:44] ichijazz: the better way to do it is with a controller or a pedal
[8:16:46] tacostarvedbeast: shadow rep
[8:16:47] bruHoran: doubt it
[8:16:50] its_ajc: COPIUM theres reop
[8:16:54] luckerooni: ive been sus about that
[8:16:57] kerndawggy: kerndawggy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[8:16:57] dumpster_diner: but yea, I get it. they're special switches that measure the full actuation of the switches
[8:16:59] sebastian2395: can you finally sell the deer heads?
[8:17:02] CuppaT_XYZ: a normal keyboard key outputs either a 1 or 0, a actuation point reading keyboard can output anything between 0.0 and 1.0 Nerdge
[8:17:08] BaldScooter: I like that theory
[8:17:12] Shrugginn: COPIUM
[8:17:15] Ezra_94: that would be nice so people aren't trying to speed run shit
[8:17:18] Thatgooey: the steelseries apex pro that i have has an update to mimic the wooting as well btw
[8:17:20] dumpster_diner: got it got it
[8:17:26] plutr0nium: My Apex Pro has dual actuation, so you could probably bind a 50% and 100% on the W key.
[8:17:26] franciscooo25: yes and sanitations new cap is 1000 but is hidden COPIUM
[8:17:30] Thatgooey: it's not as sharp and crisp as the wooting but very close to it

[10:38:21] difficultsleep3r: You are the Magnet guy after all
[10:38:21] Burntbread01: It's just about attempts, it's about not making a mistake and leaving one left, however I do think it's kinda hard

[10:47:54] ProngsAedan: google says :- The compressor is on the inside part of the condenser unit, and it's responsible for compressing refrigerant vapor. The compressor is the heart of your HVAC system. It transfers heat from the refrigerant (the liquid that cools the air) to the condenser (the device that takes heat away from the air). But obviously, this is not what it is since everything is upside down.

[10:48:56] Korathor: Because thats the point, you cannot have one block left

[10:49:04] eliteviewer77: you are not supposed to be left with one block, thats how you fail @Harry
[10:49:04] Hendrics: thats why you need to look at the thing before choosing
[10:49:04] ImAnoobiss: you need more then 1 block of the same color always
[10:49:05] ElWeto: it said turn them in for a wad of cash
[10:49:06] Fishnet83: yes its hard cause the goal is to not end up with 1 block Hmmm
[10:49:07] pimpster978: you need to get rid of 2
[10:49:07] Burntbread01: You're trying to make it so you aren't left with one block
[10:49:08] Bobofett: The point is you need to AVOID being left with one block at the end!
[10:49:09] TheCantinaband: If u at any point have a solo block of any color you have failed
[10:49:09] The__Donkey: thats the whole game, group up the solo blocks so they can be removed
[10:49:09] ThaTurtleMane: because you’re not supposed to have one block
[10:49:12] M0MENT: It's easier if you click that color last of the block that is isolated in the beginning of the puzzle @Harry
[10:49:12] PteradactylJones: works ion pairs
[10:49:12] The_BigDusty: if you have 1 block at the end you fucked it already
[10:49:13] slurpy824: have to make sure ur moves connects all thes seperated blocks
[10:49:15] fenixblac: if you have one block you did it wrong
[10:49:15] difficultsleep3r: Clear the bottom row with one color
[10:49:16] apache78: Have to end with at least 2 same color it seems
[10:49:17] hdloggy: if there is only one block of a colour you already failed
[10:49:17] ErzioCalamine: You have to find the alone ones first
[10:49:18] KrisCat: that's the puzzle aspect of it. have to figure out what to clear first so that you are not left with one block.
[10:49:18] grimblymcgoo: If you have one block left, it means you clicked that color too soon in the puzzle
[10:49:19] f2pOH: Wait if it’s Candy Crush, we need Harry, Dougie, Luciano, and Luciano’s grandma to be the hackers for this job
[10:49:20] Moby1kanobee: Top of pink Cage has like 6 AC units
[10:49:21] quassaarr: look at the top single blocks and try to remove blocks below them so they connect
[10:49:22] joe_johnny: yeah it is easy if u understand the trick tho
[10:49:22] pimpster978: one left is bad
[10:49:22] OhGyMod: Yeah it's Really hard to do when you have 1 left...
[10:49:25] Rabelz: so stop clicking in ways that leave one block. if there is 3 blocks and 2 are together you can't click the 2 bruh
[10:49:27] t_swoop: this appears to have nothing to do with the dongle
[10:49:34] truckthunders: I think you can only eliminate blocks connected with matching colors

[13:51:40] dandaredus: wrong order of colors

[13:51:45] paulaasc: yess
[13:51:45] DrakeNightbane: That one was clearing one color before another, which isolated a color
[13:51:46] Miffmac: cause it affects how they collapse

[13:51:47] theduckmarley: you have more time than you think

[13:52:06] esla1tp: Think how yuno would think

[13:52:08] asyraflau126: so you cab kearb'
[13:52:09] GrandTreasurerOfHell: Window
[13:52:10] asyraflau126: clip?

[13:52:12] joe_johnny: u are rushing lil bit. you got it tho
[13:52:13] daltonthesprout: check the response time if there is one at all
[13:52:14] zdrago666: You are not waiting for the block to fall before you decide the next move
[13:52:14] asyraflau126: cliop itttt
[13:52:14] obscurewill: @Deventerwarrior it doesnt cool down when its off
[13:52:16] blacktarcopium: prio top pairs when there are only a few blocks left
[13:52:17] GrandTreasurerOfHell: Roll ir window up
[13:52:18] Khul_Sardaukar: wait, is that why next door alarm was going off?
[13:52:19] PkTwo187: this from the hq app?
[13:52:19] CorporalPhoenix: WWYD
[13:52:23] Notorious_Chow: Dont touch isolated colors
[13:52:26] ATadBit: is there a site for this type of puzzle. it looks fun LUL
[13:52:29] Big_Reeeeeee: Do they always drop down and move left?
[13:52:31] CaptainQuirkalot: the alarm is gonna be a pain once more people find this job, you'll turn up to location and itll be going off already with cops there
[13:52:32] devious_lab: ThatsLife
[13:52:34] Deventerwarrior: @obscurewill that makes the car even worse LUL
[13:52:42] obscurewill: @Deventerwarrior yep
[13:52:42] asyraflau126: clip it and learn
[13:52:48] daltonthesprout: just remember WWYD "what would yunoo do"
[13:52:49] Petrified_Pufferfish: if they help
[13:52:50] CorysAlternative: just dont leave a single one at the end
[13:52:51] Nickknows: that last one u had to hit the green before u hit the blue
[13:52:52] RabCrangoon: @ATadBit Candy Crush LULW
[13:52:54] gow_kaiser: just connect them no?
[13:52:54] kuaci1: see the vod of the last one its good example
[13:52:54] rubano_01: Check the vod
[13:52:55] zZannaH: find the single square, and keep a group of the matching color
[13:52:56] Miffmac: depends sometimes the order matters because of how it collapses
[13:52:58] Akin_winz: It collapses Left and Down you have to group the singles
[13:53:00] gasal17: do the easy ones last
[13:53:01] Khul_Sardaukar: its like tetris
[13:53:02] Mr__Muggles: you had blue set green set blue set, you got rid of one blue set and the other sets fell out of order, if you take green set it only left blues no matter how they fell
[13:53:05] lordcooterkilla: yea, you were doing great.
[13:53:06] hitoriZ_52: With more practice, I feel like you'll be pro at it
[13:53:07] SaintReif: Better install Candy Crush bucko OMEGALUL
[13:53:07] indyfaria: go back to
[13:53:07] van_ar: Don't clear big groups if there is a single of the same color
[13:53:08] thecleverfish: you need to save a color with 2pairs
[13:53:08] kronogotthis: you can still do the job right
[13:53:09] zdrago666: I feel like you are too many moves ahead of yourself
[13:53:12] commonlinkfan: Theres no magnets
[13:53:12] spite_gg: look at the isolated colors first then find a way to connect it with its groupp of colors
[13:53:14] KcsBack: yea they drop down
[13:53:16] daaanielJ: gotta look at what colors solo and never click that color until it meets its friends
[13:53:16] pantryghost: start from the right, try and group stragglers together
[13:53:17] rubano_01: Nonetheless you are improving
[13:53:23] CorysAlternative: any single ones have to be combined that simple
[13:53:26] esla1tp: You overthink it
[13:53:26] daltonthesprout: youre getting better and thats all that matters
[13:53:27] 2belr: need to play some Bejeweled or Candy Crush to learn KEKW
[13:53:28] iusetrackpad: just try to make sure there will be at least 2 squares of any color
[13:53:28] lolSMCballs: let the single ones snap to the bigger groups, if there are two big groups you gotta  pop the group between them so a new single block isnt created
[13:53:28] BR3EZE_: Ever play 2048?
[13:53:30] shiifon: gotta watch out for the one that create isloated colors near the end
[13:53:31] Rool_Gonzalez: this is like tiny Bubble breaker
[13:53:40] Akin_winz: Yes
[13:53:42] wruper: you should not leave one alone box
[13:53:42] Big_Reeeeeee: yea
[13:53:43] kasadork: yes
[13:53:44] joe_johnny: yes
[13:53:44] 00Elite: yes
[13:53:45] am_kuro: ye
[13:53:46] luckerooni: logically yes
[13:53:46] The_Orange_Flash: each move should be attempting to iso one color
[13:53:47] tinyxmia: yeah
[13:53:48] lolSMCballs: yes until it joins a bigger group
[13:53:49] joe_johnny: yeah
[13:53:50] pavankrishna_: Yes
[13:53:51] MarginallyNoted: Wonder if Yuno is still waking up every 3hrs to do the G6 tier 3 run…? lmao 🤍
[13:53:52] spite_gg: not of the same color yes
[13:53:52] RabCrangoon: So that it groups with it's own colot
[13:53:53] hypnomaze: u need to find a way to move it to the other isolated color
[13:53:54] joe_johnny: probly there is
[13:53:55] lolmaiyaa: u also have to watch how they fall
[13:53:55] RabCrangoon: So that it groups with it's own color
[13:53:58] Notorious_Chow: You ever play the Suika game that Yuno and all the guys played? LUL
[13:53:58] thecleverfish: isolated = bad
[13:53:59] Aledz_: yes there are
[13:54:00] rudypooh63: Yes you can't be left with single blocks
[13:54:00] Goddlin: way overthinking this.
[13:54:01] pavankrishna_: Correct
[13:54:01] rubano_01: For the the same Collor block to come to the isolated one
[13:54:04] Fusalol: if you see colours not grouped you need to make sure there are REMAINING colours to click
[13:54:05] luckerooni: sometimes you also have to clear certain blocks in a certain order or you screw up the formation
[13:54:07] iiidaaah: order is also important cause it collapses differently
[13:54:08] itsBinsoo: Yepp
[13:54:11] apache78: What like 3 fails before the alarm goes off?
[13:54:11] GrandTreasurerOfHell: If it's down and left just focus on the left
[13:54:12] JCanell: You need to get the isolated ones to touch eachother
[13:54:15] am_kuro: yea be careful doing massive expolosions
[13:54:15] podddhow: Warry
[13:54:16] Big_Reeeeeee: if its a one block, you need another block/s of the same colour to touch it
[13:54:18] lolSMCballs: yesss, you gotta make sure no isolated ones are left at then end
[13:54:18] jjwajih: bro's sweating on candy crush
[13:54:21] joe_johnny: yeah
[13:54:24] am_kuro: explosions*
[13:54:27] Big_Reeeeeee: then clear
[13:54:27] GrandTreasurerOfHell: Can you click single ones?
[13:54:28] AnomanderRake__: YOU CAN DO THIS FRANK. I BELIEVE dankHug
[13:54:33] kiwiiyo: can cops even do anything if they dont catch you straight on the roof ? are drills illegal ?
[13:54:33] KcsBack: YEP
[13:54:35] indyfaria: go back fuck the alarm from Kappa
[13:54:37] lolmaiyaa: u almost got it on that last one, but clicked in wrong order at the end
[13:54:38] lj_042: play Toon Blast on your phone LUL
[13:54:41] Smokay17: You got this, Warry
[13:54:42] soho1456: clear ones that have zero isolations
[13:54:43] aajinty: hacker arc
[13:54:47] itsBinsoo: Also, take your time after every click. See if new isolated ones pop up
[13:54:47] The_Orange_Flash: slightly reminds me of KAMI
[13:54:47] lolSMCballs: that alarm dont do shit
[13:54:48] AnastasiaRainee: before you clear a chunk you have to make sure there’s no isolated ones in the same color!
[13:54:53] blunder0_0: will it ever stop
[13:54:57] AnomanderRake__: I BELIEVE IN FRANK FeelsStrongMan
[13:55:03] rudypooh63: That's why the turns don't matter becUse it knows there's going to be singular blocks left over
[13:55:03] jjwajih: g!ood luck
[13:55:07] am_kuro: last time it stopped when you guys cleared 1 puzzle
[13:55:14] djerbis: just buy the premium currency to skip it or something
[13:55:16] Smokay17: Not a single police car has came to visit
[13:55:25] ATadBit: jeez these alarms are gonna make people mald
[13:55:25] KingDekar: juice it up
[13:55:32] lolSMCballs: i wanna hear earthwells voice again im tryna edge
[13:55:38] AnastasiaRainee: I think that’s messing you up the most. clearing out a large chunk of the blues for example and not checking to see if there’s a single one or not
[13:55:40] splayvin: @Smokay17 ye pings might be bugged cus same thing last time
[13:55:45] adi_hari: oop
[13:55:47] zdrago666: Speedy gonna be back before the alarm goes off, and he has like another 20 minutes of kush kish

[14:03:45] 2belr: @Harry the game is called "Same Game" when you google it you can find many games to practice
[14:03:45] KodeAkuma: @Luthercorpz u just need to keep in mind the single tiles when u click a group of tiles they dissappear and the other converge on the bottom left u need to plan how you dont have a single tile left basically
