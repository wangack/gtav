[6:12:26] Mundosaysyourfired: if you just invest 5000 dollars you're funding his bankroll
[6:12:47] Mundosaysyourfired: if you invest 15k you're investing into him buying a property and you get a cut of profits for 90 days(?)
[6:13:02] oomor: ^ sounds like it
[6:13:08] merelyMio: so it's just a loan

[6:13:53] garry_chess: Bankroll seems way more secure ngl
[6:13:56] Slaye_0140: Which is rent split by 7 investors
[6:14:13] Mundosaysyourfired: unless he can show you that his profits far outweigh 150% on 5000

[6:15:07] Mundosaysyourfired: and what percent of profits he would share if you invest 15k
[6:15:15] tttony2x: Seems easy for him to claim he made no profit and just give you back the money with no interest, a free loan
