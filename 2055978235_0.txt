This may result to a time out or ban without warning. (Meta-gaming is when you tell Nora what a different streamer is doing on the same server) Thank you. noraexPog

This may result to a time out or ban without warning. (Meta-gaming is when you tell Nora what a different streamer is doing on the same server) Thank you. noraexPog
