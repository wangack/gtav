[1:40:28] Snow_Bow14: @SoIafar Here in the Netherlands you need to have registration with you in the form of a card. But cops normally dont ask for it unless they suspect you not owning/being allowed to drive the car
[1:40:29] mystic_drewman: They do here
[1:41:42] mystic_drewman: I think if your license comes back to the car tag all checks you shouldn't need another proof
[1:42:25] BadHabitss: interesting
[1:42:26] Snow_Bow14: For me its necesary since I drive a company car
[1:42:35] mystic_drewman: Can you force gsr without RAS
[1:42:54] Snow_Bow14: So I am not the cars owner (yet) since the company owns it
[1:43:17] Snow_Bow14: Sometimes the drivers license doesnt come back to a specific car. But if it does, yes I agree with you :)
[1:44:12] mystic_drewman: Agreed tag should also match drivers license
