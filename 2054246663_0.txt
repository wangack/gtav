[0:09:33] youniceee_: lol! love your RP
[0:09:33] interiorcastle: i think with visible dropped items, a Lethal Company event would work really well- there are lots of venues for it
[0:09:36] xxunicornxx99: i love that idea !!!
[0:09:38] tbunny__: yesssss
[0:09:41] connieeeee16: DOOOOO ITTTTTT

[0:11:19] dee_love16: @xxunicornxx99 is the kitty he mentioned the same one lmao?
[0:11:25] interiorcastle: in 3.0 there were things like a Squid Games event. For a Lethal Company event, having people go into a location and bring back items of different values, while a couple of characters dressed up as monsters can act like the Lethal Company monsters would work great @ellum
[0:11:32] connieeeee16: I wanna start playing no pixel but I’m worried as I’m really shy 🙈
[0:11:35] xxunicornxx99: @dee_love16 i think so? but dont quote me on that OMEGALUL

[0:12:31] timedelaytime: Eli is 100% clown energy
[0:12:39] youniceee_: can’t wait for that song!!
[0:12:41] dee_love16: I’m just super excited Ellum because koji made it in after the tsunami. he hasn’t despite trying because he doesn’t have prio

[0:18:48] intel209: foolish would awesome
[0:18:51] connieeeee16: is no pixel only for streamers?
[0:19:06] conorflanagan05: ginge is solid, what about beetle juice?
[0:19:08] Adam402: it’s for anyone. I’m whitelisted :)
[0:19:09] interiorcastle: a lot of gamers find rp a bit hard because the goals aren't as clear as in most games
[0:19:10] Koelkoelkast: yeah would love to see dk!
[0:19:11] rw27official: In college I did a presentation on my favourite streamer and I pick you and zerkaa and angry ging
[0:19:14] conorflanagan05: beetle is hilarious
[0:19:17] cheesemoonlight: you'll just have to apply :)
[0:19:19] Adam402: but I haven’t played nopixel for like a year
[0:19:22] xxunicornxx99: @rw27official omg that is sick poggspin

[0:20:15] tatihaq: That's a great perspective to have
[0:20:22] xxunicornxx99: yeah fairs nod_mint
[0:20:39] mikeee_dr: I think it would be fun to see the gworls house pull of a heist haha
[0:20:44] tatihaq: Eli is very chaotic aswell LUL
[0:21:06] luxmomma: bet on it bet on it 🎶
[0:21:08] rw27official: In college I did a presentation on my favourite streamer and I pick you and zerkaa and angry ging
[0:21:15] xxunicornxx99: the gworls slayyy
[0:21:26] hookie_pookie: eli is one of the gworls
[0:21:28] intel209: Eli PD?? 🤔
[0:21:33] interiorcastle: only advantage of a gang i guess is because i think heists will probably require their pooled resources/the computer stuff
[0:21:52] sammysideupeggs: @intel209 i think u need a squeaky clean record for it actually
[0:21:56] danxd209: Josh how much money we looking to make today?
[0:22:09] tatihaq: The gworls would be so fun as a criminal group wether that be a gang or whatever
[0:22:17] xxunicornxx99: danse
[0:22:21] martina2411: bet on it danse
[0:22:36] danxd209: It'd be funny if you became a corrupt police officer lmao
[0:22:36] connieeeee16: has Eli met kenji yet?
[0:22:36] rw27official: ellum is the goat
[0:22:41] danxd209: With your other character
[0:22:41] interiorcastle: @interiorcastle i mean you might need to be in a gang like in 3.0 to even sign up for heists. i hope not though
[0:22:42] xxunicornxx99: @connieeeee16 no!
[0:22:49] tatihaq: True
[0:22:53] connieeeee16: @xxunicornxx99 ok thank you!
[0:23:00] simisim05: I doubt they'll make heists only gang related again, it was kind of a gate keeping thing and killed a lot of the RP.
[0:23:00] xxunicornxx99: @connieeeee16 :3 luvv
[0:23:11] duckkthegoose: Grind for the Dominator
[0:23:20] interiorcastle: @simisim05 yeah i really didn't like it. solo criminals just stopped playing SAJ
[0:23:33] oatmilkxx: hiyaaaaa hope ur doing well!!
[0:23:42] xxunicornxx99: @oatmilkxx elllumWave elllumPuddingLove swoonn
[0:23:43] interiorcastle: @interiorcastle in late 3.0 they had a gang app you needed to be signed into to do any jobs
[0:23:57] dee_love16: @oatmilkxx ginger661Wave
[0:24:12] dee_love16: I stopped watching 3.0 before that happened lol
[0:24:15] i_lowol_i: diff setup. 🤔
[0:24:20] rw27official: In college I did a presentation on my favourite streamer and I pick you and zerkaa and angry ging and how are you feeling
