[0:58:21] lowermainland_bullies: FUN FACT: growing weed indoors IRL is not as superior as growing weed out doors, wild weed is more potent as mother nature does its thing with providing humidity, air, nutrients and sunlight for WEED GROWTH, I use to work at a clipper site where we would trip the weed buts and we only trimmed in doors, we would grow everything outdoors.... maybe you should give it a shot once you get them special seeds :)

[1:50:06] MadTape6: humidity and computer racks surely nothing will go wrong
[1:50:13] 19StarP91: If you drying, wouldn't you remove humid?
[1:50:13] x_death_gun: even the lights gave up
[1:50:25] OmegamonX: running a lot of humidifiers in a server room sounds interesting
[1:50:26] ffanejj: @MrVlume i mean, humidity and dryness.. don't see how they could mix
[1:50:30] imThird: @ares666_ True they could easily put a wall there
[1:50:30] QuackstheRubberDuck: would it be worth making a room just for the weed stuff?

[1:51:27] watermelontoboggan: Do these medium racks work now?
[1:51:29] eazypzz: kick refugee
[1:51:54] edoho87: o7
[1:52:26] woejebb: kick refugee
[1:52:27] fender2k1: man these are so awkward

[1:54:00] goddogema: I wonder if Racks increase the temperature in the room
[1:54:10] netflixankill_: looking good so far H

[1:55:33] goddogema: I don't think NP4.0 drying programming is that realistic buddy LULW
[1:56:02] woejebb: IRL, im pretty positive you dont want heat in the drying room. You really just hang them in a cool, dark room for a few days. The added heat is adding humidity
[1:56:27] jen_italia69: looking nice n clean harrEz
[1:56:40] TossTheBomb: harrWiggle harrWiggle harrWiggle
[1:56:43] penguinpop11: maybe the heaters needed to be on the wall for the power point rather than on the ground like before
[1:56:55] goddogema: @woejebb That's true, people use dehumidifiers and good air flow to make the humidity escape while the temp is around regular roomtemp lol
[1:57:01] willy7hekid: would breakers exist in 4.0, too many power in one room would trip it ?
[1:57:07] anthonym115123: @woejebb heat does not add humidity

[1:57:35] goddogema: @anthonym115123 Well it makes the water in plants evaporate making the air a bit more humid and the plants damp
[1:57:38] AnyaaAya: AnyaaAya subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! harrWiggle
[1:57:55] basttige: @anthonym115123 heating something wet would add humidity
[1:58:04] Yetiee: Maybe the heater is too close and lighting the weed on fire
[1:58:16] Nightbot: PLEASE DO NOT META! Harry can only use information that his character knows in-game. Anything else is meta-gaming and won't be acted upon. If you continuously try to meta you will be timed out, or BANNED.
[1:59:09] vrYasu: how much did you have in the apt before you got the medium riacks?
[1:59:26] goddogema: It doesn't sound realistic
[1:59:29] CyanMig: do we know the number on the panel is a percentage?
[1:59:38] 19StarP91: 50% humidity is humid af imo
[1:59:52] TheRejectsAzFTwitch: I don't know shit about growing or drying weed
[2:00:02] TossTheBomb: Gotta be something...
[2:00:03] woejebb: @basttige Yeah bro think about it.. YOUR DRYING WET WEED PLANT. Adding heat to it will add humidity
[2:00:22] goddogema: Oh yeah chat is everything fixed with the electricity in house?
[2:00:26] mecryfull: fbi open up
[2:00:27] BaldScooter: unless every electrical item has a chance of failing and shocking like that?
[2:00:28] normanberlin: now you are on a list
[2:00:28] Kapper4000: have anyone else told you how they dry it?
[2:00:30] tsebaka: If three heaters dried 21 plants at x time( 3 days), how long would it take you to dry 46 plants?
[2:00:33] Dwight_Schrute_: so you are on some fbi list now Kappa
[2:00:34] chtarbi: And now he's on a watchlist
[2:00:35] PhoenixNoaua: you googled how to grow weed?
[2:00:36] ejstanding: Are heat lamps and option on this server?
[2:00:44] penguinpop11: the computer stuff is probably counted as well since it's all in the same linked room
[2:00:50] franciscooo25: That much humidity would risk the gpus
[2:00:51] Kaaylev: @PhoenixNoaua KEKW
[2:00:57] sirenamorena_: 50% humidity is crazy, I don't think is right
[2:01:05] that_irishguy0: Do heaters decay over time?
[2:01:16] bahbus: i figure you need less humidity in the room to dry the plants. the closer you can get the room to 0% is probably better.
[2:01:21] daaanielJ: irl server racks output massive amounts of heat. maybe u don‚Äôt need so many heaters if they are in the same room
[2:01:23] 19StarP91: Game mechanics can be different from RL too
[2:01:33] goddogema: well irl more humid weed burns longer while the dry stuff goes quicker
[2:01:38] imThird: @franciscooo25 Walls seem expensive but maybe it‚Äôll be worth it
[2:01:47] MrVlume: how realistic is it, cus the gpuracks would prolly don't like humidity right?
[2:01:52] yellowtristan: a very important part of weed drying is air moving around the room
[2:01:58] franciscooo25: im just kidding it surely isnt a mechanic
[2:02:01] franciscooo25: in game
[2:02:07] Hugo_0303: harrKKona
[2:02:13] TossTheBomb: harrCozy
[2:02:13] bananawonka: if anyone one of the growers are drying. you could as a group have different settings and test it out.
[2:02:14] goddogema: I'm wondering how big warehouses are :O
[2:02:26] nevah: microwave it
[2:02:27] bahbus: ah nevermind, google says between 45-55% humidity is best. in the real world anyway.
[2:02:39] fender2k1: can you mount those in the walls like A/Cs?
[2:02:41] imThird: Surely
[2:02:49] TheWitchAtWoolworths: too bad you can‚Äôt utilize the heat from the racks
[2:02:49] penguinpop11: ventilation, fans, humidity
[2:02:51] goddogema: @bahbus All depends on strain and type of weed thou
[2:02:55] Kaaylev: @bahbus KEKW
[2:02:58] MrVlume: @bahbus is that for drying or growing tho?
[2:03:02] tsebaka: Google humidity is not to dry fast, its to dry good quality
[2:03:10] bahbus: @MrVlume drying
[2:03:16] JoeKsova: I feel like that‚Äôs what people are missing.
[2:03:28] tsebaka: Probably true
[2:03:29] Hogie48: Ventilation may also need something?   Is still the "small" premade vent system?
[2:03:30] doiicie: doiicie subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[2:03:31] MrVlume: gotcha
[2:03:32] Kaaylev: Can we get a light in this room or what?
[2:03:32] penguinpop11: is that counting the whole house or particular rooms
[2:03:35] allknowing934: just stick em in the oven EZ
[2:03:35] Rool_Gonzalez: food drier from kitchern appliance store,they use tofry fruits ;)
[2:03:37] goddogema: So you want a dry as fuck room if that's the case
[2:03:37] JoeKsova: get your ventilation up
[2:03:38] xBERNARD: lights it‚Äôs so dark
[2:03:39] bahbus: @goddogema @goddogema possibly. but you know. averages and such.
[2:03:42] armzie33HD: @tsebaka its to keep the bud fresh moist
[2:03:45] violon3: much better. i like it
[2:03:45] daaanielJ: maybe create a wall to separate weed and racks
[2:03:52] ffanejj: hope yall don't get toasted in there LUL
[2:04:02] goddogema: 30% humidity for fast drying and 50-60 for good quality tasty weed
[2:04:04] penguinpop11: there's a hole above the door to the room lol
[2:04:12] allknowing934: scuff house babyyy
[2:04:12] iiidaaah: The thing about drying is that you cant have 0 humidity cause it just destroys it. Even tho techincally it dries faster yes
[2:04:16] armzie33HD: 60% when curing
[2:04:22] iiidaaah: talking irl ofc
[2:04:29] TheWitchAtWoolworths: @penguinpop11 uh actually good point.
[2:04:29] TheGleeb: did it get darker?
[2:04:37] bennbenn22: what's "Water" chat ?
[2:04:51] goddogema: according to University research 30% is the lowest u can go without "RUINING" the grow
[2:04:53] armzie33HD: 6.0ph
[2:05:07] TossTheBomb: PepeHands no charcoal filter
[2:05:15] TheWitchAtWoolworths: @bennbenn22 irl water is another name for formaldehyde

[2:09:11] TheGleeb: its scuff for you, working in others eyes
[2:09:31] fublian: Are you putting all the items in the correct folder? they need to be under the rooms folder for the room feature to work

[3:57:29] Nightbot: The Wall is not impulsive The Wall simply exists to do what is required of The Wall. One day it‚Äôs to watch the beautiful sunset, the other it‚Äôs to watch the beautiful sunrise. The other is to watch an army try to take The Wall , but The Wall simply exists.

[3:58:15] wadiyatalkinabeetm8: In that case tho its brown that can't take it not Lang

[7:28:44] PkTwo187: how are these people even getting guns
[7:28:51] faynue: a lot of people don't realize how important rep is, they see the low amount of money and think it's not wroth it
[7:29:01] Niktory: some people just love driving cars and losing cops
[7:29:01] DevilDF: They probably dont think like that because they arent making money from it
[7:29:14] mCerti: @mrdumpling420 yeah haha and Mr K makes everything super entertaining
[7:29:24] FinnaCrow: @jsketchy01 yeah outside of the felony. the investment for the boys shouldnt matter. they are with everything around them

[7:32:52] dumpster_diner: @hemiepi you gotta grind jobs from the Lowe's parking lot kraAh
[7:33:24] FaramirRat: I have a Rasta Royale grinder, its made out of copper, including the screen, was like 60 bucks when i bought it, but its gone through A LOT, i smoke at least a gram or two a day, of weed over its been i think 6 years now and it still doesn't get stuck or anything.

[10:20:40] ishouldprobably: are lockpicks legal to sell or are they contraband?
[10:22:10] Fr3dtastic: Fr3dtastic subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[10:22:39] ishouldprobably: if they are legal, it seems like a no brainer, its free lockpicks for life. I mean you get all the mats at sani. you can pool the union and have them deal as a side hustle to make more money
[10:23:04] Fugeki: I assume the BP for the LP is similar to the BP for the grime boxes / sani boxes too bad no one really runs towing in the group
[10:23:14] cosnik: @ViableTV thats my go to, little bit of cold after a hot shower in the morning is great

[10:25:43] mannybull: why not reverse into that spot
[10:25:52] FinnaCrow: could require more than 25 mats -> over 100$
[10:26:35] ryuudrg: so the lockpicks are the tower guys gatekeeping or is some rare drop ?
[10:26:48] ishouldprobably: lang ic knows, Mary told him . not sure harry was at that convo
[10:26:52] FinnaCrow: then you got to add $ for seller incentive

[10:54:33] CyanMig: its cool to see you growing, i still remember farmer brown when 3.0 crops came out
[10:54:37] g_gud: Aware the "ban me" boost PepeLaugh
[10:54:39] ProngsAedan: I mean you used to do very well in 3.0 with car chases. But obviously things changed. Sadge

[10:54:51] ZunixHD: also im sure if you want to get to bank robbing first you will need someone with max rep at g6, just a theory
[10:54:51] its_russo15: @danng the arush early game carry was crucial
[10:54:56] Nickknows: damn did the chop npc move again he isn't there anymore

[11:47:50] LinksmutisLt: I hear you guys, but when server is so scuffed they will be more inclined to think it poofed on it's own Shruge

[11:49:46] its_ajc: dunno what that chatter has been watching, server has bugs but not RPing a security guard isnt scuff
[11:49:48] TastyKudzu: Honestly leaving a truck of money open alone then being surprise pikachu when something's gone is fail RP.

[13:16:37] exo__23: lets just try with 15 eacb next time
[13:16:42] StamaasG: Just split them into 15s before you put them in
[13:16:42] TastyKudzu: Maybe it reps every 15 he buys?
[13:16:44] reyvanr: I think 25 rolls at a time for rep increase
[13:16:45] stoneymcstoner69: He is hungry feed him more

[13:17:14] StamaasG: Try to do 15 at a time
[13:17:20] Idejder: grime boxes give great rep because each box = 1 rep increase, but cash is 15 = 1 rep?

[13:26:04] awesomephilip11: Cleaning the washed bills probably is the best next.
[13:26:15] ProngsAedan: [Chop --> Fence <-- Thieving] --> Dirty Money <-- [Weed] All of this for Heists potentially? It's all a web of criminal network and everyone who puts in the work has their place. wow
[13:26:30] tz223: Octo or Tony for sure

[13:29:05] ProngsAedan: 25 more
[13:29:05] its_ajc: EZ
[13:29:06] Tuccbag: And we've still got like 50 boxes
[13:29:09] RagingSantas: @lyfmobile he had a lot of scuffed chops
[13:29:10] slackeeeee: Morning chat. Did the weed dry by any chance?
[13:29:12] TastyKudzu: Don't even really need to overpay for doors. Just pay them in clean instead of dirty. Save them 3 steps.
[13:29:27] lyfmobile: @ragingsantas bro tony is so scuffed LUL LUL
[13:29:39] nsk_envy: Home stretch
[13:29:56] megamanyvr: flash is going to take forever to clean all that cash
[13:30:09] mustangant_: it got buffed
[13:30:15] CaptScary: I think chopping got buffed
[13:30:18] lyfmobile: thats was not even full car
[13:30:29] BerzerkHitzDiff: !meta
[13:30:29] Nightbot: PLEASE DO NOT META! Harry can only use information that his character knows in-game. Anything else is meta-gaming and won't be acted upon. If you continuously try to meta you will be timed out, or BANNED. harrH
[13:30:38] LinksmutisLt: @lyfmobile also crowbars were very hard to come by, you would occasionally get robbed etc, I don't think Tony has done more than 2-3 chops since crowbar was bought
[13:30:43] boz0777: holy shit these tunnels are massive
[13:30:44] SolidN: oh shit yeah they definitely buffed that. you would get like 1200 for a full car
[13:30:54] BuddhamanRL: you couldnt find a closer spot to the dude?
[13:31:02] nsk_envy: To be fair cops found out about chopping quickly, so it got risky fast
[13:31:13] Conz3D: What was the result of the massive heating? Does it dry faster?
[13:31:47] ProngsAedan: people just leave em everywhere LUL
[13:31:54] zerk159: Ez grime box
[13:32:08] Zelsear: This reminds me of archeage and stealing people's shit lol
[13:32:35] pavankrishna_: it is a bug I guess
[13:32:40] FairlyFunnyFelineFriend: could have been scuffed back then too and now it's fixed
[13:32:42] megamanyvr: cash is weird for sure
[13:32:49] nsk_envy: Does he take bags and what's in the bags? @harry
[13:32:56] CyanMig: it might be like earthwell? maybe that was an 0.1 run equivalent
[13:33:13] ProngsAedan: diminishing returns I think
[13:33:15] Tuccbag: When you split it into different slots hes probably counting multiple bills at once
[13:33:17] ProngsAedan: not scuff
[13:33:23] quassaarr: 3 days of work
[13:33:39] Alerto92: how much money have you invested in this
[13:33:40] Zelsear: Your inventory is a mess
[13:33:48] resipitidur: How did he get the boxes?
[13:34:04] FairlyFunnyFelineFriend: well not like "buddha scuffed" but more like unpolished. But I dunno, it's just a thought
[13:34:06] nsk_envy: I meant do you need to pull the money out the bags first? Or will he just take the bags as is.
[13:34:08] pavankrishna_: it is taking slots to rep not counting bills
[13:34:11] ProngsAedan: @Alerto92 not a lot, he found it by hours of looking around and a network of contacts more or less doing the same. :D
[13:34:17] misfit_justice: @resipitidur Kenny found a shitload
[13:34:24] cola_kela: A tip for convenience in the future, if you're grabbing the rolls, you can right click to split 1 into the inventory, or shift right click directly to put every roll you can to your inventory
[13:34:48] Alerto92: @ProngsAedan but he have paid to his friends some money too :)
[13:34:58] mullybags: isnt the 30 stack still marked as group 6 money?
[13:35:05] mkrbx: Chatting this is the rat lord
[13:35:06] ProngsAedan: @Alerto92 that is why I said not a lot. :)
[13:35:22] bygoneflygon: their quality is slightly less than the others
[13:35:38] nwmnfosho: i love being able to place items so much
[13:35:55] FairlyFunnyFelineFriend: wonder if these furniture boxes give more rep

[13:36:28] CheffBoiRZ: gonna need a second bench just for money LUL
[13:36:29] StamaasG: Octo gonna need to run the money for the next 24 hours straight
[13:36:32] necro1511: yeah probably need some more washing machine
[13:36:32] sedaiii: people are backseating but only some of them are getting scolded for it
[13:36:48] nissuJ: is twitch bugging?
[13:36:54] odious_right: Stream lagging
[13:36:55] allli3nn: f?

[15:45:51] Salios: @hitoriZ_52 ah good I guess but rip on the dry speed. Thanks!
[15:45:56] Xernique: yeah, flash deserves it for sure
[15:46:01] sam17896: pallets will be there at the docs tony can do it himself when he got back
[15:46:06] allotras: if they continue like this they can power level everyone in a week too LUL
[15:46:23] LinksmutisLt: @sam17896 they looted all the palets

[15:46:54] hitoriZ_52: @salios <3
[15:47:05] soleb_xx: what happens if you open those accessories or medical boxes? does it give you items? or cash like g6 bags?
[15:47:19] LinksmutisLt: @Foxxera_tv boxes are only like 0.25-0.3 per
[15:47:30] Tootikins: Tony is gone for a while remember chat, might just be best to give to all to Flash
[15:47:33] Foxxera_tv: oh ok @LinksmutisLt
[15:47:36] Tuccbag: If its minimum. 2 per than its like 45 at most to hit 100 now
[15:47:46] LinksmutisLt: @Foxxera_tv they give random but smh like that on average
[15:48:06] allotras: if you could open grime boxes for loot it would be a literal loot box opening stream
[15:48:12] Foxxera_tv: Is harry vouching for flash on the group ?

[15:49:11] reichenbachs: luciano or arush would have the patience
[15:49:14] heysongr8: yeah he would lose his mind doing this
[15:49:22] resipitidur: Rolled cashed heavy tho
[15:49:25] Tuccbag: I'd give him like 3 runs max before his acdc kicks in
[15:49:29] Foxxera_tv: Harry might be 1 of the onlys with 3 100rep right now LUL
[15:49:30] civlaz: Lang probs get the whole group to carry shit for him KEKW

[16:25:35] Bill_Collector: Momager for sure
[16:25:36] StamaasG: @coreshottv well it's an IRL thing. In rp it needs to be like high level crime for it to work

[16:55:24] allotras: ye i think that is fair just wondering how it is gonna work out
[16:55:26] miri_cb: @Nightbot exactly, it's not like they all are doing the same thing, as long as everyone has a purpose
[16:55:33] ahr1than: was easier to do when you had 100 stars in your eyes
