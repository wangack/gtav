[2:29:37] Nightbot: In the grand tapestry of civilization, ads play a pivotal role in advancing society. They propel the wheels of progress by showcasing new ideas, innovations, and breakthroughs. From introducing life-changing products to announcing medical breakthroughs, ads enable us to stay informed and connected with the ever-evolving world around us. Without them, our knowledge would stagnate, and the spark of ingenuity might fade into obscurity.

[2:57:58] Minato_in_Texas: @sh00tingexpert it's a very rough cut of meat, that's why it's cooked for many hours, until at least it has an internal temperature of 195 degrees Fahrenheit
