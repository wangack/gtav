[2:05:30] SurvivorPlayz999: mmm
[2:05:30] searlesbarkleyk: power consumption is prob lower
[2:05:36] TropicalToucan: you also have to spend a lot of cash on the shitty gpu BPs
[2:05:37] Cobiyyy: you save on power with rack prob
[2:05:39] tblcx: Keep in mind the usage of the blueprints that will cost you BUTC also
[2:05:48] ChaseMeredith_: its worth upgrading
[2:05:49] wetwafflez: @omie glovebox?
[2:06:03] danialdiego_: buy a rack from him for buttcoins so you don‚Äôt have to spend on the drone app

[2:07:20] ItsDoozerrr: w
[2:07:23] 3lonpich: the new GPU is badly balanced. theres not much point in having a gpu that costs 2x more, but is only 2x better (unless cost of power is too much)

[2:08:22] txch321: Nerd the early game efficiency isnt worth the amount of cost on the newer cpus so therefore its more cost efficient to get worse gpus
[2:08:35] luckerooni: if you get the bp today and build the rack, and tomorrow he sends you 3 coin to dl the app, then you can pay him back with the rack farm from the first day

[2:08:45] JoeKsova: get the blueprints now
[2:08:52] 15moo: 15moo watched 3 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! 
[2:08:57] Cobiyyy: @3lonpich a rack uses 10 power no matter how many gpus are inside, a full pc costs 50 power, so if you make 10 pcs its 500 power wile a rack is 10 for more butc
[2:08:59] 3lonpich: @txch321 yea exactly, since new gpus are time gated, its better to fill with bad gpus and buy tons of racks
[2:09:03] searlesbarkleyk: yuno gonna spend coins for marty lol?

[4:23:16] Stepanov370: @And_Deez like not starting with 420
[4:23:19] SopaEJH: that 375-2222 is pretty good 700-3231 is also not bad
[4:23:32] Gh0stZer0Phant0m: @Aldonaitorr  Usually when that happens, the business pays a monthly fee plus a entering fee at the start to get it and continue. They might want to Rp that.
[4:23:39] Fossabot: omieEvil watch omie's newest video: https://youtu.be/S8rbYuNDXQI "Marty Banks | First Day of NoPixel 4.0"
