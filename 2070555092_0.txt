[3:58:13] Fossabot: REMINDER: Backseating and Meta'ing is cringe. We do not want to see suggestions of where they should or should not look, do, etc. Nor should you remind the streamer of things he has forgotten. Him forgetting is part of the RP fun. 4.0 is new, unknown and exciting. Do not ruin the experience for the streamer (or chat) with your unwanted comments. You will get bopped into the next century. 🙂

[3:59:24] Tier3Timmy: PD is eating good today KEKW
[4:00:09] Tier3Timmy: I was wondering is it just your character or do you like ISO yourself as well?
[4:00:53] Tier3Timmy: Hahah that kinda makes it even funnier
[4:00:54] player1legion: what is ISO ?
[4:01:14] miliitrcz: KEKW
[4:01:55] lalablacksheep9: I’m surprised we don’t have a command for that yet
[4:02:08] Usafosarar: It is a word, derived from the Greek isos, meaning "equal," which is the root for the prefix iso- that occurs in a host of terms, such as isometric (of equal measure or dimensions) and isonomy (equality of laws, or of people before the law).
[4:02:21] Usafosarar: tobiiiGiggle
[4:03:11] CescSanabria: @lalablacksheep9 Because ISO isn't important. Much like UTC.
[4:03:24] Readyamyfire: nikezISO nikezUTC
[4:03:53] Tier3Timmy: What made you decide that it will be the main trait of your character?
[4:04:35] Usafosarar: Because you were right in the middle of your ISO Cert stuff, ya?
