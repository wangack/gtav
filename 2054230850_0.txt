[0:46:38] jr_darkseed: patrick mahoms dad got arrested on a dwi
[0:46:41] Anrisacia: Internal thoughts you were having during the meeting with the Raiders MC leadership?
[0:46:46] elvic_: first day of spring semester got cancelled due to rain kivaCozy
[0:46:55] ItsJardo: as a long term wrestling fan im disappointed in the state of things
[0:47:04] Tyler4AM: It was a lot of fun actually, somebody took a video of it and ngl I lowkey killed that shit
[0:47:21] AdamElJefe: @ItsJardo you're not the only one Jardo, I feel your pain brother
[0:47:25] FGonzalez214: did you just put on The Ranch Soundtrack? lol
[0:47:50] ItsJardo: @adameljefe im hoping they’re just trying to recreate the YES movement
[0:48:12] whyiamso: @Tyler4AM Stand By Me is a classic! On Friday I plan on doing karaoke at my cousins bar and singing Jolene
[0:48:28] Tyler4AM: Yeah wrestling is kinda crazy, TLDR is The Rock basically just inserted himself into the biggest match of the year and a bunch of people are really mad because he's taking an opportunity from another guy named Cody who they've been building up for like two years
[0:48:34] Tyler4AM: So people are pissed at The Rock
[0:48:42] adisappointeddad: it has to be Cali I heard the rain over there is absurd lately
[0:48:47] kai4life96: when they flood yeh
[0:48:51] Anrisacia: I live in an area considered a boreal rainforest. Rain aint stopping shit here kivaLUL
[0:48:53] FGonzalez214: bless you
[0:49:02] elvic_: In souther california yess. I didnt think they needed to cancel it but im enjoying it lol
[0:49:05] AdamElJefe: Like, if they wanted the Rock to face Roman at Mania, then they should've just had him win the Rumble
[0:49:24] ItsJardo: sadly that would be even worse
[0:49:27] Tyler4AM: @whyiamso Oh hell yeah, that's a great choice
[0:49:58] Tyler4AM: The person who has the championship rn, Roman Reigns, has had it for over three years and people just want him to lose the goddamn belt to Cody already
[0:50:02] Anrisacia: kivaJammies
[0:50:16] ItsJardo: what Tyler said
[0:50:42] AdamElJefe: Cody's drive for it is because it's the only title his late father never got
[0:50:44] Tyler4AM: They want someone new and the entire story has been Cody winning the WWE title, because his dad Dusty Rhodes could never win it
[0:51:40] AdamElJefe: Kinda both kivaLUL
[0:51:49] xaalayahx: both
[0:51:54] sage40k: the behind the scenes stuff makes me eyeroll
[0:51:54] JamesDog_: his dad was a wrestler too
[0:51:55] Tyler4AM: The Rock inserting himself into the title match is actually real apparently lol, like he joined the WWE as a no bullshit executive a month ago
[0:51:57] adisappointeddad: looks like Roman isn’t losing the belt till next year’s Wrestlemania cause there’s no shot he’s losing to the Rock
[0:52:08] ItsJardo: oh its all predetermined but itll still be a feel good moment if he was able to get it
[0:52:28] whyiamso: Isn't Roman the Rocks cousin?
[0:52:35] AdamElJefe: ^
[0:52:38] StaticEchos: ^^
[0:52:39] xaalayahx: @whyiamso yes
[0:52:53] AdamElJefe: Because that would make sense Kappa
[0:53:06] JamesDog_: because money
[0:53:16] Tyler4AM: The way it was presented within the script was that Cody is giving up his opportunity to The Rock
[0:53:21] adisappointeddad: Cody can insert himself but they usually like booking one on one bouts for championship matches
[0:53:30] AdamElJefe: The Rock's reasoning is because he's Roman's cousin and there's a whole "head of the table" thing that they're fighting over
[0:54:07] sage40k: reportedly part of the rock joining the tko board included the rock headlining wrestlemania
[0:54:15] RadahTatTat: so the Rook's the new
[0:54:18] RadahTatTat: oops
[0:54:20] ItsJardo: as of last week he has given it up
[0:54:27] adisappointeddad: Cody is gonna fight the other champion Seth Rollins, I don’t think he outright gave up his opportunity
[0:54:29] kbubz41: rock inserterd himself into codys roleplay
[0:54:31] whyiamso: man this is some spicy wrestling drama, almost at kdrama levels
[0:54:42] Tyler4AM: In storyline he's giving it up, in real life the WWE creative and The Rock pushed him out of it
[0:54:45] wizardiis: OMEGALUL
[0:54:55] AdamElJefe: that's not wrong tbh KEKW
[0:54:59] Tyler4AM: Honestly that's a good way of describing it KEKW The Rock is third partying hard
[0:55:05] sage40k: basically the rock is diong what he did to the dc movies lol
[0:55:13] adisappointeddad: The Rock has main character syndrome
[0:55:26] wizardiis: AAAA
[0:55:30] Luroloro: he's force loring poor cody
[0:55:37] FGonzalez214: hoa wins survivor to win 1 mil, but cg comes outta no where and says they win while CB is holding the money
[0:55:47] FGonzalez214: lol something like that lol
[0:55:50] RadahTatTat: so chat,  the Rock is the new big 'boss' and now WWE is prioritizing the Rock's family drama over Cody's father's legacy? kivaNotes (yes i am now invested as well)
[0:55:50] ItsJardo: the rock 3rd partied and ICU’d Cody from the story
[0:56:01] Tyler4AM: Ok imagine if Andi for two years was being built up to lead the HOA and take over for Siz, but then all of a sudden a character named John Koil came in and was like "Actually imma lead the HOA"
[0:56:04] Nightbot: Follow Kiva on Twitter! <3 https://twitter.com/KivaLive <3  Join Kiva's community on Discord! https://discord.gg/Tm7UzE8cem <3

[0:56:28] zorcandspoon: kivaNotes kivaNotes kivaNotes
[0:56:36] FGonzalez214: yup pretty much
[0:56:37] Tyler4AM: But OOC Kiva was like "This is bullshit"
[0:56:51] FGonzalez214: no, you would say hes better then you
[0:56:55] ItsJardo: and Cody was made to shake the rocks hand as well which was even worse
[0:56:56] sage40k: would andi be the Stephanie? XD
[0:56:58] RadahTatTat: oooh... cuz the Rock is the new big boss...? kivaNom
[0:57:12] Tyler4AM: Yeah actually Andi IC had to be like "This is a great choice, John Koil deserves this"
[0:57:19] FGonzalez214: made cody look like a bitch
[0:57:19] AdamElJefe: Yeah, unfortunately Cody did a whole promo about the situation two Friday's ago and it made him look really stupid
[0:57:29] ItsJardo: like basically shake hand and smile for losing his story
[0:57:49] Tyler4AM: Ok somehow through the power of roleplay chat explained this pretty well KEKW
[0:58:00] DJ_4point0: So like, as payment a firm handshake?
[0:58:29] wizardiis: All i know about wrastlin is that the undertaker fought the undertaker one time
[0:58:37] sage40k: i kinda want chat to recap ppvs for me like this from now on ijpREPORT
[0:58:49] RadahTatTat: also a waste of natural story momentum right? kivaNotes
[0:58:52] Tyler4AM: That would be called the Royal Rumble
[0:58:52] Tuckerbonage: Chat better explain it well when we do nothing but watch roleplay and work all day KEKW
[0:58:54] Tyler4AM: Which Cody won
[0:58:59] Luroloro: maybe if they just communicated better
[0:59:05] ItsJardo: that was the royal rumble where Cody won his opportunity
[0:59:24] Tuckerbonage: So the under taker?
[0:59:31] DJ_4point0: GTA roleplay is a great analogy to explain almost anything NODDERS
[0:59:37] adisappointeddad: Well Wrestlemania is still a good bit away it can be a triple threat match but idk if it’ll happen
[0:59:47] FGonzalez214: tbh wrestling and roleplay arent much different
[0:59:49] ItsJardo: oh so early 2000’s ROH
[0:59:51] sage40k: pre heel turn baley?
[1:00:07] Tyler4AM: There was a character called Kurt Angle who was presented as a massive dork in all of his promos and backstage segments, but then in the ring he was an IRL olympic gold medalist who would beat the fuck out of people
[1:00:12] FGonzalez214: nope lol
[1:00:17] AdamElJefe: they've been called worse things KEKW
[1:00:25] TKE_Super_Dave: They'd compare it more to acting

[1:00:36] sage40k: i think xavier woods has been on nopixel a few times
[1:00:39] Tuckerbonage: They are playing a role at the end of the day
[1:00:55] ItsJardo: Xavier woods is fantastic

[1:01:20] AdamElJefe: ^
[1:01:24] JamesDog_: god can you imagine how Kiva would have reacted to Right to Censor
[1:01:37] AdamElJefe: my up was to gonzales
[1:01:49] FGonzalez214: Right to Censor has the best entrance music tbh
[1:02:00] DJ_4point0: Roleplay is just a type of Improv is just a type of acting Acting
[1:02:10] FGonzalez214: JOLENE!
[1:02:22] AdamElJefe: There's a really funny video that encapsulates wrestling pretty well, it's called Wrestling Isn't Wrestling and I think you'd enjoy it

[1:20:09] ItsJardo: they did it to get more eyes on the product
[1:20:26] Tyler4AM: Yeah he's still a POS, but he is a pretty good wrestler ngl
[1:20:26] Scorner: you mean scum artist
[1:20:37] adisappointeddad: yea they got him cheating his ass off LUL
[1:20:56] adisappointeddad: using brass knuckles in matches and all that
[1:21:00] Tuckerbonage: Logan Paul went from being cancelled to UFC fighter to wrestler KEKW
[1:21:38] FGonzalez214: Boxer not UFC Fighter
[1:21:41] Tuckerbonage: Well wrestling is a popularity contest so most of the fights are rigged
[1:22:14] Sapphire_Tears: as long as someone is famous, they won’t ever be cancelled
[1:22:26] zeman94: Well Andi is also fighting under the alias Nina on Tekken kekw
[1:22:28] adisappointeddad: I don’t think it actually ever worked
[1:22:30] Tyler4AM: Cancel culture a lot of times seems to be used as a buzz phrase by comedians as an excuse for why they're not allowed to say horrible shit lol
[1:22:40] maova: Did you see the drama of people saying Taylor swift disrespected Selene Dion at the Grammys cause she looked away from her when accepting the reward?
[1:22:40] jetsorjetski: It depends on the size of ur audience imo, if you're like a B-list celeb then cancel culture is definitely real
[1:22:42] wizardiis: NODDERS
[1:22:59] jetsorjetski: yeah tru
[1:23:00] Sapphire_Tears: @tyler4am yup. they just itching to do it too
[1:23:09] Tuckerbonage: Ah you're right @fgonzalez214
[1:23:15] jetsorjetski: like the 21 Savage/Playboi Carti - Adin Ross drama atm
[1:23:20] Tyler4AM: Yeah like people can talk about how Louis CK got 'cancelled' but that dude is still selling out arenas
[1:23:22] AdamElJefe: HUH
[1:23:25] maova: Yeah its real dumb
[1:23:28] Rablit: Yo it's Flippin Monday yal
[1:23:34] maova: Buts its the only tea i had
[1:23:34] toastandbutter: people still watch the Grammy's?
[1:23:35] AdamElJefe: that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard
[1:23:47] Tyler4AM: Bro celeb culture is so weird KEKW
[1:23:50] DJ_4point0: I wouldn't be surprised if teams for large celebrities have developed strategies to deal with being canceled
[1:23:53] wizardiis: KEKW
[1:24:16] elvic_: sameee
[1:24:17] Thrath: Taylor Swift has become one of those celebs people hate to just hate without reason tbh
[1:24:17] ItsJardo: Taylor Swift has reached a new level of popular
[1:24:24] Tyler4AM: Just wait until the Super Bowl this weekend, it'll be in overdrive because the broadcast is 100% gonna show her watching it a bunch during that game
[1:24:26] adisappointeddad: it doesn’t help that the NFL are bringing her up a lot on their socials
[1:24:47] wizardiis: People are especially looking for any reason now with the NFL stuff ^
[1:24:56] Tuckerbonage: Oh got Taylor Swift fans are a literal cult KEKW
[1:24:58] maova: Omg the nfl stuff is wild
[1:24:58] toastandbutter: NFL brings up Taylor Swift for that sweet sweet ad revenue
[1:25:00] Tyler4AM: Her entire tour was insanely impressive, like hearing the story about how she performed in the rain for like 3 hours is wild
[1:25:00] AdamElJefe: KEKW
[1:25:05] MYounk: There is wild conspiracy theories atm about TSwift
[1:25:11] wizardiis: These dudes are so pissed at her existing KEKW
[1:25:11] eancu: uwuLAUGH
[1:25:20] FGonzalez214: its only at chiefs games tho. \
[1:25:23] Tuckerbonage: Oh god*
[1:25:26] Tyler4AM: bRo ShE's DiStRaCtInG fRoM tHe GaMe
[1:25:41] nevertooldtoplaygames: lol she is only shown 25 seconds in a 3 hour game
[1:25:44] Tuckerbonage: OMEGALUL
[1:25:44] Gh0sty541: Its only like shes shown for 30ish seconds in a whole 3 hours
[1:25:47] nevertooldtoplaygames: on average
[1:25:47] maova: And then nfl commentators are coming out saying its great for their sport shutting down the already zero points they had
[1:25:48] FGonzalez214: I never hear about Taylor when im watching the Dallas Cowboys Breaking My Heart
[1:26:09] Tyler4AM: Listen I say this as a man with a degree in sports, I couldn't give less of a shit about the Taylor Swift stuff lol. The amount of commercial breaks annoy me wayyyyy more than she ever would
[1:26:17] FGonzalez214: ^^^^^
[1:26:28] nevertooldtoplaygames: agreed
[1:26:33] inus2: the amount of commercial breaks in nfl and high profile ncaa games is insane
[1:26:40] FGonzalez214: i hate when they take a commerical break and then a fucking timeout break like wtf
[1:26:50] Tyler4AM: ye it's wild inus, and they find ways to add more every year
[1:26:50] BadWelshie: How could taylor swift and andi jones do this?
[1:26:59] wizardiis: @Tyler4AM We need to make the sequence of score --> ads --> kickoff --> ads illegal
[1:27:14] adisappointeddad: if anything having Taylor shown a lot is helping the sport be more popular cause now the Swifties are tuning in
[1:27:22] FGonzalez214: NFL should be like the world cup. only commericals at half time
[1:27:36] vonmunna: HotPokket !!!
[1:27:44] maova: @Tyler4AM I pay for a service in Canada to watch nfl online and they still fill it with ads for every second they can, there is no escape
[1:27:50] Tyler4AM: @wizardiis It's even worse in basketball sometimes, timeout/ad/come back/foul call/TV timeout/ad/come back
[1:27:57] Rablit: This songs giving me church life ptsd lol.
[1:28:07] toastandbutter: Back in my day, Justin Bieber used to be the same way
[1:28:32] Tyler4AM: Kiva you're really distracting from my roleplay experience by making Andi Jones look like a lumberjack Taylor Swift, could you please change her outfit
[1:28:40] maova: Writing a song about your life?? kivaPog
[1:28:46] Tuckerbonage: Well to be fair her fans are kinda crazy KEKW
[1:28:46] wizardiis: @Tyler4AM kivaDed
[1:29:26] jetsorjetski: @Tuckerbonage yes but it's not exclusive to her, stan culture is everywhere nowadays
[1:29:30] ItsJardo: i can only compare Swifties to how 1D fans were like back in the day
[1:29:43] Tyler4AM: I don't think an artist can be defined by a shitty fanbase tbh
[1:30:02] jetsorjetski: I think it depends on how the artist interacts with said fanbase
[1:30:07] inus2: anyone with a fanbase that large will have extreme portions in it, like kpop groups etc
[1:30:11] wizardiis: When someone is as famous as her its pretty much impossible to control NODDERS
[1:30:17] Tyler4AM: Like I'm sure those KPop groups are fairly normal despite all of their insane twitter stans lol
[1:30:45] DJ_4point0: My dad has a story, though he tends to embellish things, where he used to work a bar in Nashville and Scott Borchetta walked in one night and talk to my dad about signing this 14 year old. My dad tried to convince him that was crazy and tried to dissuade him. Now my dad is glad he didn't succeed.
[1:31:16] DJ_4point0: The 14 year old was Taylor.
[1:31:25] Tyler4AM: And to bring this conversation all together, Taylor Swift as a teenager was a babysitter for a famous wrestler's kids
[1:31:28] Tyler4AM: Jeff Jarrett
[1:31:45] Tuckerbonage: Yeah Taylor is fine it's just her fans kinda go crazy if I had to compare it's like your parasocial chat members who go after other people OMEGALUL
[1:31:54] Soydrager: @tyler4am ol snapnuts
[1:32:25] FGonzalez214: J E Double F J A Double R E Double T
[1:32:49] Tyler4AM: Yeah it would be different if the artist on Twitter was like "Ok stans do your thing, go ruin this person's life" lol. Most of the time they don't even run their own twitters or any social media
[1:33:06] maova: It becomes connected to the brand no matter how much the person tries to stop it if it continues
[1:33:13] Thrath: I have the upmost respect for streamers who call out dumb shit like that NODDERS
[1:33:32] spenston: sandstorms are pretty cool but they must be hell if you live in Sandy
[1:33:33] Anrisacia: Can we still meme on Tyler for his bad food takes though? kivaSus
[1:33:46] Tyler4AM: 2024 is the year of W takes from me
[1:34:05] Tuckerbonage: That's kinda Sus ^
[1:34:05] jr_darkseed: so does that men that Jeff Jarret gave her a guitar
[1:34:06] maova: Tyler do you like Siracha on Havarti?

[1:34:17] ItsJardo: Tyler changing his view on sour cream

[1:37:37] ItsJardo: hearing this i want to hear her sing wuthering heights
[1:38:13] Tyler4AM: I remember watching T Swift perform as a guest act on America's Got Talent when she was like 17 and still not super well known, she's legit done nothing but skyrocket for like the 15 years after that lol
[1:38:22] minutejuice: is this really Miley or is it ai

[1:40:55] FGonzalez214: T-pain does pretty good covers too
[1:40:59] AdamElJefe: @Tyler4AM that's what she won her grammy for last night
[1:41:08] jetsorjetski: So Kiva is this ur usual music taste, or is this like a Stream specific playlist?
[1:41:17] Tuckerbonage: It would be great if the paleto houses were worth the amount of money they cost KEKW
[1:41:31] spenston: @Tuckerbonage KEKW
[1:41:49] AdamElJefe: Like, it's crazy, Miley has had 9 nominations in total, but only finally just won her first Grammy, that's wild
[1:42:00] Tyler4AM: Kiva listens to exclusively underground trap music on stream
[1:42:04] Tyler4AM: Nothing but bangers

[2:03:48] goldbaroon: what
[2:03:51] wizardiis: I have an irrational hatred of Ed Sheeran
[2:03:51] ItsJardo: this song was everywhere
[2:03:52] Servroxas: HOW Vnowaying
[2:04:19] Tyler4AM: So I wanna see Poor Things because it's made by the same director as The Favourite, and I heard it's like insanely good
[2:04:43] Tyler4AM: But idk if it's still in theaters
[2:04:43] wizardiis: Just his music kivaLUL

[2:06:07] jetsorjetski: shape of you is such an awful song
[2:06:14] jetsorjetski: but Ed Sheeran overall is fantastic imo
[2:07:07] ItsJardo: tbh having Harry not be slytherin Hermione not be Ravenclaw and Ron being the only Gryffindor was a miscall
[2:07:57] jetsorjetski: well wasn't Harry's overrode by him just not wanting to be slytherin?
[2:08:34] ItsJardo: and in the original edit of the books Neville was going to be the 4th friend in the friend group
[2:08:46] Tyler4AM: You can't discriminate against Harry for being in Himbodor ok
[2:08:47] imdeatht1: To be fair he lived under the stairs
[2:09:16] Matenkai: @Kiva thoughts on Dobby and how harry got him killed?
[2:09:33] ItsJardo: @matenkai why did i read that in a reporters voice?
[2:09:52] Matenkai: harry's fault cause hes dumb!

[2:10:44] spenston: D:
[2:10:46] Tyler4AM: Harry grabs the knife immediately as they exit the portal, and then just stabs Dobby with it
[2:10:54] Tyler4AM: and he's like "damnnnnn what a tragedy"
[2:11:13] Tyler4AM: "Sorry guys I thought that was Voldemort"
[2:11:20] Anrisacia: NOOO

[2:11:39] 420thMagicMan: people would like jar jar if he died in a similar way
[2:11:48] Soydrager: My niece refused to watch the movies until she was like 14 because Dobby terrified her LUL
[2:12:04] spenston: @Soydrager And not like the giant spider for example?
[2:12:10] Tyler4AM: I cried when Voldemort died, he didn't deserve it Sadge

[2:13:02] wizardiis: I can't believe the star wars sequels main villain wasn't Jar Jar who's been a Sith the whole time

[2:14:09] Tyler4AM: Yeah this song might be worse than Shape of You ong

[2:35:59] NoManners: KEKW

[2:36:04] Nightbot: Follow Kiva on Twitter! <3 https://twitter.com/KivaLive <3  Join Kiva's community on Discord! https://discord.gg/Tm7UzE8cem <3
[2:36:16] Redeyes: I can see him writting them and not releasing them until after he passes
[2:36:23] MYounk: its been so long though
[2:36:35] CSKo_5: if this convo becomes one of the HOA death curses I’m going to lose it
[2:36:46] NBTyler: all kinds of petty KEKW
[2:37:04] Tyler4AM: Turns out he finished them like five years ago and is making people wait because they've been complaining too much
[2:37:09] Tyler4AM: Yeah lol
[2:37:14] MYounk: I think he's technically on a shorter hiatus than the HxH author - who actually does have medical issues
[2:37:53] delora2842: I remember people thinking he purposefully sabotaged the show's GOT ending since a lot of people didn't like it so he would release his books which had a different ending
[2:38:42] delora2842: Its all a big conspiracy just like GOT
[2:38:51] ItsJardo: he said that the show could’ve gone on for another 3 seasons
[2:38:56] Tyler4AM: Lowkey I want him to finish the books but have the exact same ending as Season 8 just to see how people react
[2:39:03] Thrath: Show ending was all D and D's rush ending KEKW
[2:39:16] CSKo_5: he was not impressed, especially for a guy who is so into details, he was not amused with all the loose ends and unfinished storylines lol
[2:39:38] Redeyes: or HBO is paying him not to release his version of the ending
[2:40:06] delora2842: @Thrath Yea i think D and D wanted to rush to go do star wars but ended up getting booted from that
[2:40:07] mazzu7000: because star wars
[2:40:29] Thrath: Show also could've gone on for 3 more episodes for those last two season to make the characters have build up so the story makes more sense
[2:40:41] Jerco2020: Treating it like the one piece tomatoPog
[2:41:15] Tyler4AM: 50 Shades of Grey just wanted to write some weird Twilight fanfic and ended up as a millioinaire
[2:41:23] CSKo_5: didn’t it take years for game of thrones to kickoff?
[2:41:26] Tyler4AM: *author
[2:41:31] MYounk: that poor kid who wrote Eragon
[2:42:17] delora2842: Yea the original pilot had to be reshot
[2:42:26] Thrath: Even then the pilot was rewritten 3 times before it got picked up
[2:42:42] Soydrager: Eragon the movie came out and it was TERRIBLE
[2:42:45] Tyler4AM: The first GOT book came out in the mid 90's
[2:42:49] MYounk: he was like 15 when he wrote it, self published, fought tooth and nail for it, it was really successful then the movie adapation killed the interest in the sequels
[2:43:27] Soydrager: The author of Eragon is extremely talented but yeah the movie killed that series
[2:43:40] Thrath: Squid games s2 and House of the dragon s2 is all I have tv show wise to look forward to peepoHappy
[2:43:46] MYounk: he wrote like 4 books
[2:43:47] Tyler4AM: Didn't the guy who made Squid Games try for like a whole ass decade to get it picked up by someone
[2:44:02] elvic_: they missed so much stuff in the movie
[2:44:05] Soydrager: I was reading the prequel and lost the book somewhere LUL
[2:44:56] delora2842: My partner is obsessed with the hunger games and she definitely had something to say about the prequel movie
[2:45:00] Soydrager: The worst movie adaptations I've seen are probably Percy Jackson and Enders Game. I was so mad about enders game.
[2:45:20] Tyler4AM: The Artemis Fowl movie was a crime against humanity
[2:45:32] nuttymoose4: i think what is crazy is how old some of these books are and people find them and determine that they can become a top hit like Lord of the Rings(1954). like who reads these old books out of nowhere
[2:45:38] CSKo_5: poor Tigress
[2:45:40] Soydrager: Or the maze runner movie I heard was pretty bad too
[2:45:45] Its_Pars: artemis fowl was a pretty awful movie
[2:46:03] elvic_: I wished Lucy would have sang deep in the meadow in the movie
[2:46:15] cuccumberz: the Percy Jackson and Maze Runner movies being bad really sucked as someone who really enjoyed the books
[2:46:19] Rablit: Books pretty aight
[2:46:34] delora2842: I was like 12 when the maze runner movie came out so i thought it was alright, watching it back though...
[2:46:40] Tuckerbonage: I wish they finished the Percy Jackson was continued
[2:46:50] jr_darkseed: I wish they would continue Enders game
[2:46:50] CSKo_5: I’m sorry to say I didn’t make it through the first maze runner book
[2:46:50] ItsJardo: i am number 4 book is great the movie was god awful though
[2:47:26] Soydrager: I need to go with the his dark materials show. I loved those books
[2:47:39] Legendoftiny: has anyone watched past the first episode of the Percy Jackson series on Disney
[2:47:57] Tyler4AM: That's such a power move ngl
[2:48:01] delora2842: Now thats commitment
[2:48:08] Soydrager: @legendoftiny it's reviewed pretty well
[2:48:19] CSKo_5: I just had my little sister summarize the rest
[2:48:24] Tyler4AM: You ever get bored by a book and just say "Fuck this" and read the last like 5-10 pages to figure out what happened
[2:48:26] wizardiis: @legendoftiny I watched some of it so far
[2:48:28] whyiamso: @Legendoftiny I thought it was...very mid, room for improvement as the cast gets older
[2:48:29] Tyler4AM: So you can move on with your life lol
[2:49:01] Tuckerbonage: I loved the Percy Jackson movies if only they did more of it
[2:49:23] Rablit: Ever read leviathan? And it's series?
[2:49:51] ItsJardo: the green mile NODDERS
[2:49:52] MYounk: I still defend the Watchmen adaptation
[2:50:00] Its_Pars: My favorite book to movie adaptation is Stardust
[2:50:05] Tyler4AM: The Godfather movie is even better than the book
[2:50:10] Soydrager: I lived stardust
[2:50:15] MYounk: Stardust is great
[2:50:16] Soydrager: Loved*
[2:50:55] Tuckerbonage: Oh no KEKW
[2:50:56] CSKo_5: OH NO
[2:51:00] ZevChiromo: The Godfather books were better than the movies because the characters had a bit more depth, but both were great.

[2:51:44] Sunwolfcreature: anyone read the latest crescent city book?

[2:52:58] MYounk: its crazy how many great adaptations of Neil Gaiman stories there are. Coraline, Stardust, Sandman, American Gods, Good Omens
[2:52:58] 420thMagicMan: a lot of people spoiled the half blood Prince ending for my older sister at that time
[2:53:05] dogmemeavi: were you even more upset when you found out who died? KEKW
[2:53:15] SavageSIKMplays: TRAUMA
[2:53:17] Tyler4AM: Imagine if she read it and was like "Huh, good riddance" and then went along to pick up some grapes or some shit lmao
[2:53:19] whyiamso: Just remind her of that moment whenever she tries to Ult you lol
[2:53:33] Tuckerbonage: And on that day Kiva learned that she couldn't trust anyone KEKW
[2:54:07] Tyler4AM: So I didn't read the books when I was a kid, only watched the movies but I overheard my mom and brother talking about the HBP book and how Dumbledore died
[2:54:10] DJ_4point0: I was worried you were gonna say she then spoiled it, but at least she didn't do that.
[2:54:11] primebastionstrats: for some reason i equivilate that to the people who use the drive dry the lines for the HP books and just yelling out insert random character dies.
[2:54:22] Soydrager: I remember half blood prince came out on my birthday and my mom drug me to go watch it after I had taken a melatonin and she fell asleep during the movie and I somehow stayed awake to watch it LUL
[2:55:03] Tyler4AM: I just picture her holding that over your head as a kid if you didn't do your homework or something, she's like "If you don't listen to me imma spoil the ending to that fucking book Ally"
[2:55:15] ItsJardo: i read halfblood prince cover to cover in like 4 hours non stop I couldn’t stop reading

[2:56:55] Soydrager: When I was separated in boot camp all I did was read like 15 hours a day every day for like 2 months waiting to get sent home. I read so many books. I'd fall asleep on my bunk with a book in my hand almost nightly.

[5:16:43] Tyler4AM: That kinda happened to me with sports journalism. Went into college thinking I was gonna be a sports writer but then lowkey had a come to jesus moment with a guy who wrote for a newspaper and was like "the politics and personalities play a significantly bigger part than how good of a writer you actually are"
[5:16:59] Tyler4AM: Also the pay was shit, that was a factor too
[5:17:19] minutejuice: *top of lungs* “it’s to laaaate*
[5:18:06] Tyler4AM: It's sooooo much worse nowadays too with how media outlets go about writing their articles. So much of it is lazy AI bullshit now
[5:18:15] AdamElJefe: I was lucky enough to get some decent assignments when I wrote for my college's newspaper
[5:18:44] AdamElJefe: My first assignment was to interview this celtic flute player that was performing at our college, he was absolutely fascinating

[5:20:38] maova: Have you put it to paper in concept to be reformatted as a script? I find having words down in the way my brain reads it helps make it into dialog and scene breakdowns
[5:21:07] Tyler4AM: Of course you can
[5:21:23] Brumorin: that can all be refined and iterated on as you learn
[5:21:38] minutejuice: that’s the director is for
[5:21:38] Tyler4AM: Scripts aren't a 1:1 format, as long as the idea is good I think you'd be fine
[5:22:36] Brumorin: just word vomit it all into word
[5:22:53] Tyler4AM: Holy shit I completely forgot this song existed lmao
