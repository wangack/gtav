[3:47:39] Pog_Hammarskjold: Or if not fun, at least not mald-worthy. Poor Barry with his weed scuff.
[3:47:40] DreamerMori: It doesn't help when there's a progression system, and things like guns/drugs are unlocked to people who were there first
[3:48:01] fatalnightshade: Especially with the frankly ridiculous fine for claiming someone is your kid while you haven't paid the state to do so...
[3:48:20] WitchenInTheKitchen: time to become a degen for gang and flop activities
[3:48:23] Ominarii: I really hate how a lot of the jobs are two people jobs too :( it'd be cool if there were more group jobs for people to hang out and do
[3:48:26] lord_dragox412: @fatalnightshade It's to prevent peepoStuck RP Kappa
[3:48:31] junk_dog96: I think once radios are affordable that will help
[3:48:35] jbirdosaurus: @pog_hammarskjold I think some are just demotivated seeing the simple monotonous jobs like G6 and Grime making ppl stupid rich so fast
[3:48:37] curvyllama: do you miss the early morning crew?
[3:48:40] melll_exe: do you feel like you rushed into joining admc a bi? granted you had been spending a lot of time getting to know barry over the first month

[3:48:59] phinnaeu5: Well this is depressing, lol
[3:49:10] Caetano73: Wait… anyone that thought the servers direction would be towards RP and not an mmo style degen grindfest has not been paying attention to who now partially owns the server
[3:49:21] AnticrosslandDraws: I wish Grime made me rich.
[3:49:22] curvyllama: what’s depressing?
[3:49:25] lord_dragox412: @Caetano73 Or 3.0. Or 2.0 KEKW

[3:49:45] Pog_Hammarskjold: @jbirdosaurus for sure. And now it's been what 9 weeks of that grind heavy mindset? You'd hope there would be more stories, less workaday stuff

[3:51:09] Mr_Jaffs: Sorry if you've already said, but why dont you play tex on no pixel?
[3:51:10] melll_exe: hope the endless grinding slows down eventually, and buggs can get to know admc a bit more
[3:51:12] jbirdosaurus: We saw it with Dodo in 3.0, some ppl will just do nothing but that to watch the number in their bank go up treating money like a highscore essentially
[3:51:18] pyrocharlie: Put up options and we can vote?
[3:51:24] fatalnightshade: Tbh in a way I think the grind is good but I feel they overdone it tbh

[3:52:59] Skythace_FI: could always play smite
[3:53:11] puddinfox98: I think its strange that the jobs discouraged you from doing all the different jobs, that just leads to faster burnout from the grind.
[3:53:13] CaptainSighmon: @Ziggy Pssychotic started up another Ark server if you wanted to try that
[3:53:14] WitchenInTheKitchen: I think some chaos mod would be a fun time ziggyjSmile
