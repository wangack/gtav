[0:27:52] RetPaladinBot: After getting these numbers we find find the average flaccid penis size ( 3.61 ) and divide the average erect penis size (5.16) and do the following: 5.16/3.61 to get the soft to erect ratio. 5.16/3.61=1.42 inches erect for every inch soft. So we take esfands soft/slight chub size of 5.71 and multiply it by 1.42 to find his erect size. 5.71*1.42= 8.1

[6:09:41] improvisablex: Chat, how did Cornwood react to Denzel suspension?
[6:09:45] ShyMuffin: @kiolkjm they could make it have limited fuel, so you have to refuel if the chase lasts  too long which makes it a bit more balanced
[6:09:47] Ironwolfextreme: should be a HC mode or something more strict on death :P

[6:20:30] ShyMuffin: @scotty2thotty18 but to be fair, some of these DAP were just not really fair. I think he got one for cuffing a person disrupting the mayoral debate while not in uniform. None of the 4 officer present at the time tried to arrest the lady that was threatening the candidates. Like I understand it's RP but it's a very early stage of the server and he's almost already fired lol

[6:29:26] nickdrawsstuff: @EsfandTV DAPs are stupid, and should really only be given for people that break the police rules to a degree that the RP is ruined --- there are other ways to reprimand people --- take the gun away, make them do dispatch for a day, etc.
[6:29:26] Maethra: it seems obvious to me that sheriff is your show to run YEP
[6:29:26] Chavirst: why not have 1 captain and the other 2 lieutenants ?

[6:58:03] notsonew: PD morale was rock bottom at the end of 3.0, then it somehow got worse

[6:59:05] planeswerecool: @Sillyanne exactly
[6:59:05] vozalth: The legendary wide receiver cornwood
[6:59:07] HeyMeghan: the problem is they are short staffed and basically 2 of the ppl who ARE always around have BS daps on them to the point they are almost suspended. he‚Äôs saying it‚Äôs going to discourage them from wanting to actually work then that will trickle down etc.
[6:59:09] Pearso95: Cornwood stopped at the lights Pog
[6:59:09] PsychoJoker: yet they wont hire Ziggy OuttaPocket

[6:59:28] DenizenOfTheVoid: good old sr buns
[6:59:29] elbinn: cops not coming around is also bad for crims. There are no stakes for crime if no cops to catch you. There needs to be a balance for the servers sake.
[6:59:31] kikoshi_za: is otk a religious group?
[6:59:33] faroeislands_: People are making such a big deal out of an innocent question KEKW

[7:00:06] DenizenOfTheVoid: yes, patrolling is boooooring, but its 50% of police work
[7:00:07] shadzjr: tbf a lot of people take the weekend off

[7:00:12] SkyeReaper: I think vods should be like body cams
[7:00:14] crowgoes: Kind of ironic because these are the same reasons a lot of irl cops quit
[7:00:14] kikoshi_za: @HistoriesPiston esfand or cornwood
[7:00:15] shermz4: Cornwood is not the hero we need but the one we deserve
[7:00:16] bzerk26: Chat does Cornwood still have all the guns on him
[7:00:17] L_a_z_o_r: then you get DAPed up for no reason
[7:00:18] Snackkbar: w chasing RP

[7:00:30] bulletproofapee: Are you lea ning more towards mayorship now? @esfandtv
[7:00:30] iNF3RNO_ZA: The public needs to arm themselves, then they can take care of themselves
[7:00:31] Jeremyohno: The amount of things like that for the PD is piling on fast

[7:00:43] notsonew: Suing police isnt story-building RP, maybe it has been once or twice like with meowfurryon or one of the Pred cases
[7:00:44] kikoshi_za: whats FCO
[7:00:44] Dagda45: FTO burnout is a real deal
[7:00:44] DenizenOfTheVoid: the streamers tend to spend it with families maybe
[7:00:45] SMFTwistedSMF: @Sillyanne Yeah, I am not sure about Ziggy. I dont know of him much. I only started watching him during the whole Ignite RP stuff. But man, Yeah..Snow that makes no sense to me at all.
[7:00:45] widbar: mhm shouldn't there be more cops on weekends?

[14:14:59] K4shira: I think it's good to have a day off here and there to change up the dynamic
[14:14:59] SebNZ: Isn't 60 days, 2 hours real time, it should align with the jail time?
[14:14:59] Mastodonian: criminals get out of jail in 30 minutes though kekw

[14:15:37] BoldSlowbro: should be 30 days
[14:15:37] Dypadl: @sendemup the ridiculous thing is that pd works with irl time, meanwhile crims work with ingame time LUL they go in jail for 30 minutes meanwhile they get the 60days pressure points above their had
[14:15:37] HustlerOneX: prolly either increase the DAP or decrease the drop off time

[14:15:41] McKibbo: 5 daps in one day should not be allowed their stacking charges
[14:15:41] KillerKolsch: should start the robocop program
[14:15:43] Paudelly: Den zel even said the same thing. He said hes not initiating shit. Not putting cuffs on anyone, not being responsible for writing reports
[14:15:43] Dawnsaan: chat it's 60 days IRL to reset ur DAP points
[14:15:43] THE_Palmer1452: no other way to get them removed either, yeah?
[14:15:43] slatt5: i think it should be a case by case basis not a point system
[14:15:43] Deventerwarrior: 15hr X 60 is 900hr playtime to lose DAPS

[14:15:56] holyknightfran: I agree
[14:15:57] sendemup: @Dypadl yup huge immersion break as well
[14:16:00] holyknightfran: esfand is right
[14:16:00] streptomyces: maybe make DAP removed based on hours worked? so people who work more it gets removed proportionate to the time that they‚Äôre clocked in?
[14:16:00] jackback___: hell no, i just  go to make some broke the law
[14:16:01] hey_im_numbers: what is dap shortening from

[14:16:07] Aphotice: daps should drop off after like a week, not 60 days
[14:16:08] omn___i: cornwood starting to sound like Esfandtv mhm
[14:16:13] OGpicklehead: if anything it should be based on time on duty
[14:16:19] RPGFiends: pretty lame when you put someone in jail for 60 months.. and is minutes compated to 60 days irl for a dap
[14:16:20] Yourrmajesty: Justice for shiesty!
[14:16:22] nAw00b: The cops are already super useless, and they want to limit the Cops even more ? Is 4.0 just for crime only ?
[14:16:23] vicious_pen: I could see like two weeks, two and a half
[14:16:24] Kfoo_: @buy_gme_shares yeah, I mean cornwood got a bunch of daps and suspended in the course of a 15 minute meeting
[14:16:26] CamQuarters: gotta have give gotta have take

[14:30:49] SmokeyAlaPot: @ronjeremy42069 I was referring to Den getting Daps for the rolls of money
[14:30:50] serioushustle: I like how an officer gets suspended for 24hours, but an avreage prison sentence for a crim is a few mins LUL
[14:30:50] FrankieFunkk: promotion incoming EZ

[14:30:57] xxlonegunmanxx: @GuerrillaGavin don't worry, they can Dap you after the guilty verdict.
[14:30:58] DrWetbone: don‚Äôt use Cletus name to the other captains or he‚Äôll get a dap
[14:30:59] Soap__64: THAT'S A GOOD COACH

[14:31:09] DamadorHS: esfandCOPS esfandW
[14:31:11] afkbrb: @rodragil i agree honestly even though i enjoy dean's stream

[14:31:27] PlainWolfie: @rodragil i dont know about denzel but gtarp has a lifespan and usually after awhile then variety streamers tend to quit
[14:31:29] D_2104: Cornwood for police federation rep? @esfandtv
[14:31:29] Dypadl: @rodragil that's also kinda true ;/ but I get him cause those detective things are probably the most interesting to do
[14:31:30] darthpuff2544: Cornwood being ride or die for Den is so heartwarming

[14:31:44] cr0pdus3r: HahaLean HahaLean HahaLean
[14:31:47] RebornOffline: Should be in the meeting and explained why, so people learn from it
[14:31:47] EclecticMotives: peepoTalk
[14:31:47] catloyalist: Positive guidance is missing all the city hears about is how the officers mess up.
[14:31:49] daddyhardtears: @plzhateme One of the captains said or seconded that a week ago lol
[14:31:49] EclecticMotives: peepoTalk  Û†ÄÄ

[14:31:51] k9_goliath: esfands mouth has 12 pack abs
[14:31:51] TacticalTangent: retroactive daps because something gets overturned is crazy‚Ä¶. imagine that in the real world. police wouldn‚Äôt ever want to stick their neck out
[14:31:53] xxlonegunmanxx: But thats something that should come up in the meeting , because how would other officers know what not to do ?
[14:31:54] SebNZ: @Strangemitts agree they need to discuss whatever soemone got a DAP for
[14:31:55] Drkdream: @Edra07 breaking the SOPs
[14:31:55] BoldSlowbro: If we could even get like 15% more acceleration and 30% Durability out of the vehicles it would feel better
[14:31:55] OphidianFX: https://youtu.be/U6s_VuIVzao?si=gnxcxQCoU4BcKZHI
[14:31:56] bobdang07hd: everyone chatting needs to apply to the server and voice their opinion if you get whitelisted. otherwise grow up it‚Äôs a video game and role play

[14:32:05] Strangemitts: @SebNZ that too
[14:32:06] samynilla: Just spring it on him , see what happens, laso
[14:32:07] Atrix646: family still hides secrets TheIlluminati
[14:32:08] RPGFiends: that should be a learning opportunity to lean in the meetings
[14:32:10] ronjeremy42069: do it together
[14:32:13] szim92: learning opportunity for the force
[14:32:14] cr0pdus3r: @k9_goliath lmaoooo
[14:32:16] illyB84: maybe the dap system should work in reverse too? like you can get them subtracted or even negative daps
[14:32:16] Tambandia: If you told me i couldnt play a specific game for a full 24hrs because of the way i played the game, i would stop playing the game.

[14:32:18] denimskirts: That should of been addressed at meeting
[14:32:19] TenderPantyz: wtf thats an emote LUL

[14:32:20] Maethra: good idea mhm
[14:32:20] EclecticMotives: peepoTalk wrong or right
[14:32:20] layziep: Esfand let him go to sleep lol
[14:32:20] Edra07: You should be know why
[14:32:22] sealblubbber: -1
[14:32:23] taraannee: and so u dont think he's just lazing off his job
[14:32:24] Itz_CIose: it‚Äôs private tho
[14:32:25] Dawnsaan: DAP point leader board Pog
[14:32:26] ajp_iii1: it should be used to teach the rest of the force
[14:32:27] afkbrb: @PlainWolfie 3.0 was around for years, so why speedrun pushing everything because of ADHD variety streamers
[14:32:29] King0fKhaos: if there was an sop that was broken for a specific reason that should be brought up in each meeting to ensure that all officers are following the proper proceedure
[14:32:29] Joskey: that should be discussed forsure
[14:32:34] McKibbo: Something going wrong, should be used as learning opportunity
[14:32:36] TheKingOfWit: it's dumb for sure, sheisty gets to go on about how unfair it was, and the leadership made no statement
[14:32:38] CrizoG: SHOULD BE PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE
[14:32:39] evilcraft22: this might be bad for cornwood
[14:32:39] dexter_dresden: Maybe denzel should have gone through retraining and guidance than just being suspended
[14:32:42] evilcraft22: chat
[14:32:43] Alexpcorbin: @bobdang07hd we‚Äôre just invested in the story and development, if we aren‚Äôt disrespecting other streamers then we can voice our opinions tyvm
[14:32:44] JorganLive: Cornwood future union rep
[14:32:45] OphidianFX: youtube link is denzel gettttttttttttttting suspended
[14:32:45] Real23Phil: he wants to know why a officer he works with a lot isn't there
[14:32:46] reeksquad: exemCry exemCry exemCry
[14:32:46] Jul1usLT: Esfand is bringing such a valid points
[14:32:50] Jenkarn: Also use the DAPs to teach the other officers what is bad police work and why it was bad what he did
[14:32:50] miketwng: chet, what's in Cornwood's head rn?
[14:32:53] raklesun: if someone just does not show up for there shift you gonna know anways
[14:32:58] TikiSmash: Disciplinary stuff should be private tbh, but leadership should be discussing the issues in professional development
[14:33:00] o0mpALoompA: Holy disclaimer lol
[14:33:02] Itz_CIose: imagine if you got suspended and the captain airs it out to the entire force KEKW
[14:33:02] k9_goliath: what if slack just said, "write a letter to your local DOJ" haha
[14:33:11] w0nkita: Binoculars SnowTime
[14:33:11] Xierany: He's right, you wanna know what people get in trouble for to not end up that way yourself, and to clarify things
[14:33:12] OniZetsumei: the main one he got suspended for was for having a report for his interaction and putting the charges related to the initial charge of stealing the PD gun on his report and not the main report, it was also some bullshit.

[14:33:17] warm_soda_: PopNemo
[14:33:18] PlainWolfie: @afkbrb i think as a streamer you wanna speedrun some content at least whilst the hype is here and the hype atm is massive partly cause the variety streamers are playing, but idk thats just my pov
[14:33:21] ronjeremy42069: @k9_goliath usually its "ill look into it"
[14:33:21] bobdang07hd: @alexpcorbin being overly invested and talking non sense is the issue. (not saying you are at all) just the point
[14:33:22] brimstonegusher: sounds like real life
[14:33:25] Highly_Dysfunctional: You need a DA!!!
[14:33:29] ajp_iii1: the force should know what people get in trouble for
[14:33:30] evilcraft22: cornwood walking on razor blades right now
[14:33:36] KillerKolsch: nope
[14:33:37] KYslippy: anything Cornwood does now could be seen as an emotional reaction or outburst to all this and get more DAPs LUL
[14:33:37] xxlonegunmanxx: Clap
[14:33:38] AlienatedFL: beyond a reasonable doubt is tough
[14:33:38] Strangemitts: good point
[14:33:39] CanadianHuman: >.>
[14:33:40] Afterman_: use it as a teaching moment
[14:33:41] cjohno20: focus on growth, encouragement, learning, correction instead of punishment, etc

[14:33:58] sticks26: Some of Denzels DAPs are fair and some are unfair. If you look at it from a neutral pov and watch Dean enough you will agree that he needs to slow down and think about the process from the moment he puts cuffs on someone
[14:34:01] redmonkeyman420: so wholesome
[14:34:03] hereforff9: i always prefer that approach but people dont take it 'not to make other people uncomfortable'
[14:34:03] Strangemitts: doesn't matter
[14:34:03] jonfett: Punishment-based leadership leads to a bad environment. Positive feedback and encouragement is also needed
[14:34:03] Killa_Clown: Who is Internal Affairs?
[14:34:04] crazfulla: Exactly and Denzel is like a brother

[14:34:06] Alexpcorbin: @bobdang07hd this is true, lots of nonsense at the same time lol
[14:34:06] NotDeto: Feels like this should be a chat outside of RP....
[14:34:06] supaiiii: who needs discipline when you got family FAMILY
[14:34:10] blender807: lol
[14:34:10] KillerKolsch: If you wanna tell everyone why you got suspended go ahead.  Departments keep that private.
[14:34:12] THE_Palmer1452: Should at least know he's not on duty
[14:34:13] soapy_mudd: it's no one's business who's suspended lol you all know the rules
[14:34:17] k9_goliath: When you get written up at a job, that stays private with HR
[14:34:19] meatlove69: Captain need tell  this about to Cornwood , not sure about LUL
[14:34:19] TeejayOCE: He has a point
[14:34:19] songoku19920: FeelsStrongMan
[14:34:20] THE_Palmer1452: Or not going to be on duty

[14:34:22] Atrix646: gat dam witch hunt KKonaW
[14:34:22] davyish: Better to have everyone learn from their mistakes
[14:34:26] Wallsh_: CASE BY CASE
[14:34:27] evilcraft22: glad it is slacks he is venting to
[14:34:27] DangersClose: People that are on duty a lot will gain more DAPs, they need to expire based off on-duty time and not a fixed 60 days!
[14:34:29] Dypadl: @sticks26 yea  I agree
[14:34:29] Itz_CIose: @killerkolsch yup
[14:34:29] ecstasy_1000: cornwood enjoy the daily cream pie
[14:34:29] bluej255: yup
[14:34:31] evilmoose__: @esfandtv Need an Officers Union. Can't DAP someone without their union rep present.
[14:34:31] sendemup: it already feels like that LUL lotta in house drama
[14:34:31] blender807: if yur finger hurts ya hands fine

[14:34:40] mouad_thegoat: True
[14:34:41] warm_soda_: it just sounds like cornwood wants less accountability mhm
[14:34:42] Your_Solution: Ooc convo for sure
[14:34:42] SmokeyAlaPot: @KillerKolsch Exactly. You want to know, make a public records request
[14:34:46] DayStreaminDavey: passionate
[14:34:50] jonfett: Let's face it: Cpt. Ruth is a bad influence in terms of toxic punitive leadership
[14:34:50] raklesun: Esfand trying to run the pd like a football team  OMEGALAUGHING
[14:34:51] Atrix646: denzel stake out/informant king EZ
[14:34:52] Aphotice: sharing why the dap happened also points a finger at the captains, so creates some mutual accountability, so captains think more about giving a dap
[14:34:59] ajp_iii1: nobody knows how people are getting the daps though so it‚Äôs just weird people are randomly gone
[14:35:00] miketwng: ngl turner would of DAP-ed him for speaking up
[14:35:02] Real23Phil: YEP
[14:35:04] bu88le5: @Your_Solution dont get your panties in a bunch broski
[14:35:05] plantcey: @raklesun COACH cornwood
[14:35:08] Sorenvael: there should be notification of officers that are off duty, so the PD knows how many units they have to work with when patrolling, just like a timetable, you dont have to know why unless its absolutely needed, but knowing in general is definitely needed
[14:35:13] imaginarydolphin: Hmmge
[14:35:16] k9_goliath: Friends and Professionalism can be toxic when mixed. Tread lightly
[14:35:16] sploofboi_: bro is speaking yapanese over here

[14:35:18] dirtysteve56ace: passion speech time
[14:35:24] evilcraft22: new talent for pd is sus lol
[14:35:25] OGpicklehead: cornwood just doing some upward coaching
[14:35:29] Reuschel: Den got DAP'ed because he took charge on the cast of another officer's stolen gun and yeah he definitely did some stuff wrong but I feel like DAPs just get stacked up so fast on people.
[14:35:30] Wallsh_: pepeW SAAB RN

[14:35:34] got_no_brakes: Hola Esfando
[14:35:36] Grunton: i dont think this is rp anymore
[14:35:38] soapy_mudd: it's RP why is this even a convo lmao
[14:35:39] PlainWolfie: @afkbrb i get that yeah but just my 2 sense about it, the moment someone like X stops streaming gtarp actively then the game generally dies down and yeah it just snowballs from there
[14:35:41] DayStreaminDavey: I wish this was an ooc convo.
[14:35:43] khrow: Slacks should pay attention and actually absorb whats being said. It's leadership 101
[14:35:44] OniCr0w: peepoTalk

[14:36:05] afkbrb: @Reuschel i actually agree with you, ruth was actin up about the situation
[14:36:07] cjohno20: this is such an important convo
[14:36:12] zeldaspirit: crims commit a felony = 5 minutes in jail, crim reports a cop for not taking a report = dap lasting 60 days
[14:36:12] w0nkita: WFAND
[14:36:12] claptil: It's an interesting conversation
[14:36:16] Dypadl: @ajp_iii1 only cornwood and denz have 7 dap points and luna with 2 today I think, so those people are not leaving bcs of the daps, but because of the pressure maybe, at least based on what I know, that's my idea
[14:36:17] HustlerOneX: DenZel did deserved like 4 of those DAP...2-3 of them were a definitely a reach
[14:36:17] supaiiii: why would this be an ooc convo when it's an in character issue? pepeW
[14:36:19] KYslippy: I think body cams would fix alot of issues
[14:36:19] raklesun: cuz rp is not just cornwood breaking the law every 5 mins s
[14:36:20] MACBS_: Truue
[14:36:20] Bobmalooga2: fuck 9 to 5... 8 to 4 FTW YEP
[14:36:23] evilcraft22: cornwood has people

[14:36:24] songoku19920: true
[14:36:24] Wallsh_: INFO GATHERING
[14:36:25] soapy_mudd: this aint RP anymore @taraannee @GlitchyByte
[14:36:25] „Éî„É≥„ÇØ„ÅÆÂ§ïÊó•: that grunton chatter is baiting you all, hes been complaining last 25 minutes
[14:36:26] yeahhyeahh: Thats a great perspective from slacks...
[14:36:27] caseyharm: LUL LUL LUL
[14:36:27] Scrando: this is my favourite reality tv show
[14:36:28] MACBS_: YEP
[14:36:29] VIPizzle: big picture, smart
[14:36:31] bobdang07hd: @zeldaspirit dude go have a nap you‚Äôre way to invested
[14:36:31] hotdogdihydrogenmonoxide: i feel bad for the people who arent watching cornwood, by far the best PD lore and story
[14:36:32] Sikwit0: OOC it's important for Esfand to bring this to Ssaab the Admin as Esfand is a big streamer who can help influence Koil, who decides how much power PD has
[14:36:33] madhatterui: hahaha
[14:36:37] Itz_CIose: @zeldaspirit type it one more time, I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll read it
[14:36:38] caseyharm: incarcerate incarcerate incarcerate
[14:36:40] nochipapaquiliztli: Counter argument..... if they have a good relationship, wouldn't the suspended officer share it with his "friends" of he wanted to?
[14:36:44] taraannee: @soapy_mudd it quite literally is LUL
[14:36:45] shwaayyy: Its still IC
[14:36:45] symoninc: was that ever communicated
[14:36:46] evilmoose__: Officers Union RP arc.
[14:36:49] NardDog222: how does the dap system work? are they suspended from PD only?
[14:36:49] Atrix646: TheIlluminati
[14:36:50] THE_Palmer1452: it's like Cornwood and Archer leaving that weed location to get the bigger bust down the road and OOC letting it play out. Shiesty just going too fast is all.
[14:36:51] yeahhyeahh: We're like the browns before chubb
[14:36:51] LogicWeasel: to counter people being impatient, this convo is hitting hard, it's about passion, glad it's happening
[14:36:55] OGpicklehead: @soapy_mudd how is it not?
[14:36:57] Trystah: im loving this convo
[14:37:01] HenryChase: burglary investigation PepeLaugh
[14:37:01] blender807: yep recruit good officers like joey kek
[14:37:03] iantenna: it's a little ooc, that's not a bad thing though. it's a bit about server health
[14:37:07] Alexpcorbin: I like Slack‚Äôs perspective, he wants to build and improve to give officers more opportunities to get better and enjoy what they‚Äôre doing like Cornwood is saying
[14:37:07] Kfoo_: This is actaully a good convo
[14:37:11] Atrix646: mista lang
[14:37:11] kasded: @soapy_mudd WTF is RP to you?
[14:37:14] bobdang07hd: @zeldaspirit go play some Zelda, take a load off your brain which is firing on all cylinders of non sense
[14:37:17] Dypadl: @ajp_iii1 when the game becomes extra work even after real work for example, that's for most people I think a bad thing
[14:37:21] Your_Solution: Yeah good convo for sure.
[14:37:21] w0nkita: this is good development
[14:37:22] typicaluser777: Esfand has a point bc Denzel said in his stream earlier today bc of the DAPs he doesn't want to be a first responder, he'll only be assisting to avoid more DAPs
[14:37:29] raklesun: there are like what 10 people on the pd? thye all gonna know regardless not saying anything is kind of stupid
[14:37:37] Real23Phil: Clap
[14:37:40] DiscretionaI: Esfand is speaking from his heart i. the most RP way as possible. Let him cook
[14:37:43] mjmjmjmjmjthriller: love this song
[14:37:48] NardDog222: what are consequences of DAP?
[14:37:49] tarafib: LETHIMCOOK
[14:37:54] zeldaspirit: @bobdang07hd lmao chill
[14:37:57] ecstasy_1000: MercyWing1 SirShield MercyWing2
[14:38:05] Kfoo_: @NardDog222 after 5 DAPS you're suspended for 24 hours
[14:38:13] Aphotice: lol
[14:38:13] jacobahhhh: What‚Äôs a dap
[14:38:14] KYslippy: I feel Cornwood should be leaning on the cruiser smoking

[14:38:20] evilcraft22: budda wouldnt go to police if it aint real
[14:38:22] k9_goliath: the only thing brief with Cornwood are his britches
[14:38:22] slomojosh: +1
[14:38:22] soapy_mudd: lmao because getting in trouble is part of RP not trying to change the rules to avoid it @kasded @OGpicklehead @taraannee
[14:38:22] theJOATx: +1
[14:38:23] Deventerwarrior: SHITSHOW
[14:38:27] imaginarydolphin: +1
[14:38:28] Dypadl: @typicaluser777 But if you think about it, that might actually get also the effect that they want, for him to slow down and be more diligent, more detailed with his work, more careful
[14:38:28] Kfoo_: @jacobahhhh Disciplinary Action point...basically a demerit
[14:38:30] w0nkita: +1

[14:38:40] raklesun: wait is cornwood a buddist?
[14:38:44] StreamElements: Post top tier content to my subreddit https://reddit.com/r/esfandtv
[14:38:44] nochipapaquiliztli: @typicaluser777  yup, it's tough for them. Staking DAPs shouldn't be allowed and the drop off time should reduce by half (minimum)
[14:38:45] slomojosh: slacks is pulling his hair out
[14:38:48] slatt5: @typicaluser777 this
[14:38:49] jacobahhhh: @kfoo_ thank you bff
[14:38:49] my69thaccount: when season of discovery new patch comes out in a month esfand is gonna quit gta so this is all for nothing
[14:38:51] surelyURjokingMrFeynman: 1) ask buddha which house 2) test key on house 3) look up owner 4) give key to owner
[14:38:52] afkbrb: @PlainWolfie you can't stop the speedrunners, and X/The Company are doing a lot of content pioneering but when they inevitably quit that doesn't mean 4.0 dies it just means they move on. Lots of people play GTARP because it's a good community and that won't go away
[14:38:52] w0nkita: I thinks slacks is great
[14:38:59] meatlove69: part of quest ,a lot of side quest
[14:38:59] tcobym: he is exhausted lmao
[14:39:00] slomojosh: !size
[14:39:00] RetPaladinBot: After getting these numbers we find find the average flaccid penis size ( 3.61 ) and divide the average erect penis size (5.16) and do the following: 5.16/3.61 to get the soft to erect ratio. 5.16/3.61=1.42 inches erect for every inch soft. So we take esfands soft/slight chub size of 5.71 and multiply it by 1.42 to find his erect size. 5.71*1.42= 8.1
[14:39:04] OGpicklehead: @soapy_mudd he's discussing that the rules might not be fair and equitable. from his position as an officer. that's 100% rp.
[14:39:06] warm_soda_: @my69thaccount COPIUM
[14:39:08] taraannee: @soapy_mudd i mean if youre not understanding the convo & the point of it & thats all u see it is, that doesnt make it not rp
[14:39:11] Alexpcorbin: @raklesun lol he‚Äôs referring to another character named Lang Buddha
[14:39:14] hey_im_numbers: @tcobym yeah KEKW
[14:39:16] fwog_: cornwood losing his accent

[14:39:37] tarafib: admin^
[14:39:38] soapy_mudd: nah this is a butthurt player through and through
[14:39:46] k9_goliath: hahahaah Slacks would dive on a grenade right now if he could
[14:39:47] Kfoo_: @Strangemitts he's an admin
[14:39:48] kasded: @fwog_ its almost 15 hr stream
[14:39:49] tcobym: @Strangemitts hes a senior admin
[14:39:50] scotty2thotty18: @strangemitts he's staff. So just under management
[14:39:50] cjohno20: 5Head
[14:39:51] Wynter282: im glad hes saying this to slacks but at the end of the day slacks is the only one who fights for his officers, he is outnumbered by 2 hard asses
[14:39:53] OGpicklehead: @soapy_mudd you're talking out your ass
[14:39:57] Wandering_Ranger: @EsfandTV Or just match the lock to the house
[14:40:03] Strangemitts: thanks @chat i thought something like that
[14:40:04] PlainWolfie: @afkbrb yeah but denzel speedrunning it is most likely cause of this either that or just his character being hasty, im aware the community stays till basically 5.0 gets announced etc
[14:40:07] Legendary_phantom: RP is hard work buddy subShrug
[14:40:12] Frankendoink: this is probably my favorite part of RP, not the drama, but just intricate convos like this
[14:40:13] tarafib: i feel like if esfand an admin with ssab nopixel wont die out cuz these convos r really important
[14:40:15] my69thaccount: esfand taking this way too serious. needs a break from gta
[14:40:17] Sorenvael: just have a master record at city all
[14:40:18] Bobmalooga2: @RetPaladinBot Hmm
[14:40:19] bobdang07hd: everyone that‚Äôs so overly invested, there‚Äôs a nopixel website you can go to. get whitelisted and take it up there. If not go find a reddit please and thank you
[14:40:21] TiqerWoW: accent -1
[14:40:24] typicaluser777: @Dypadl Personally can't differentiate Denzels RP from his real emotions. But from my view, he looked heated to the point he didnt even play Denzel and made an ALT. But I could be wrong, he might be doing an act
[14:40:25] ActuallySupremacy: Just check ownership papers?
[14:40:29] MachineDoll: key id is such a great idea
[14:40:30] OphidianFX: lookup the access rights on the house tablet
[14:40:30] Aphotice: the owner could lock id per key to tenants
[14:40:43] joar767: aint no way you guys are standing here still
[14:40:46] imSteffin: @typicaluser777 afaik he rolled the alt because he didn't want to RP off duty.
[14:40:49] THE_Palmer1452: MDT info

[14:41:04] k9_goliath: Cornwood should be a professor
