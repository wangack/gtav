[0:42:21] Crankster42: Elden Ring in 10 days, still no gameplay footage monkaS
[0:42:22] zenlogic101: But even the gameplay didn't really introduce anything new or compelling
[0:42:23] VikingDuke: remember when naughty dog said they were done with jak and daxter because they wanted to grow up
[0:42:24] Yokota777: @panac Not even. Joel is arguably a better character than almost all characters in this sequel. Easily.
[0:42:26] MonteVidi: @kingpresiden I SAID HI

[0:42:40] eXon_LV: Is this NOPIXEL???
[0:42:43] darkloony54: even if the payoff at the end is good a game shouldnt make you wait that long to make it worth it
[0:42:45] snakebruv: a lot of work was put into certain areas, but others are severely LACKING
[0:42:46] jeannnbean: yeah sadKEK
[0:42:49] Jtl012: @Namiako__ thacoopHi hey

[0:42:51] Kebeanboi: Nothing real unique to Ellie which is a shame
[0:42:53] Chompsy: @anneq27 Mehdi is a very generous person when it comes to video games I've learned over the years
[0:42:53] MatrixSpiderX1: Thats not always a bad thing
[0:42:56] theshowoff993: the marketing and everything leading up to the game wasnt great either
[0:42:58] Jtl012: @veautifulnovakin uhnHello !
[0:42:58] carmexisfire: Why are you on a roof? Whats the backstory? Are u okay james?
[0:42:58] TheBuzby: a major game rating company gave it a 3/10 lol but I want to see the ending before I judge it @UberHaxorNova

[0:43:01] thelegendarypotatoes: true
[0:43:01] TheGaffer88: it feels smoother but its the same core
[0:43:02] salimshadyttv: They should’ve let us build up the community in Jacksonville, in a non annoying way at least.
[0:43:04] Superjelly: @UberHaxorNova so it has repeat gameplay from the first, the story is being called bad, and graphics are the only good quality. thats a oof
[0:43:07] MuchoMongo: Kinda feels like it should have been DLC
[0:43:09] wholesomeloaf747: @vikingduke naughty dog said that they wanted to make their games more serious that's why
[0:43:10] Sydancian: Yay! Tall Grass! what a feature!
[0:43:13] TheRarePotato: oh yeah Saab's score was around 6-7 too but then he changed his mind saabKEK
[0:43:13] Tyler4AM: It’s still good gameplay even if it’s unoriginal
[0:43:16] fatpapinate: Just finished the vod glad to see you're live!
[0:43:19] DudleyIsDumb: @crankjob42 elden Ring isn’t coming soon lol
[0:43:20] Amazing_Jordy: I will say, when it comes to naughty dog games, they don't often change up mechanics when doing sequel games.
[0:43:20] X_TheChemist_: The knife sneak attack is a plus though.
[0:43:20] StuntWax: I think if they continued the story right where the first one left off instead of throwing us four years into the future with a forced romance and pregnant problems and half the gameplay isn't even Ellie or Joel or even Tommy
[0:43:22] KingPresiden: @sirpenguin911 itsboo1Love
[0:43:23] EddieDevs: gotta give her the crossbow LUL
[0:43:25] koffsyrup: a lot of the characters in the first game were so fleshed out. This new cast feels empty and the one getting the most attention is Abby.

[0:43:51] DRspector: just say it was all a dream and you're good
[0:43:51] Yokota777: They were so concerned in making this “uncomfortable” story that they forgot about making any legitimate progress in the gameplay which to me is identical to that of the first.
[0:43:54] NeumanPryde: I think there’s settings for the vision thing
[0:43:54] Superjelly: this game can just be written off as a fever dream ellie had KEKW
[0:43:58] Nuke_Liar: its just fanfic spinoff

[0:45:58] Amazing_Jordy: Tomb raider reboot games were amazing, but it also had no massive change in mechanics between the 3
[0:46:05] wafflehose: @vibe_nero agreed
