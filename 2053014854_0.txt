[0:41:38] Sympathizee: Dean you are so cool
[0:41:51] Riqui__: how long does it take to lose daps?
[0:41:56] m4l1kkk: Bro is scared as hell saying it doesn't stop him from working LUL
[0:42:00] combattingjosh: @Riqui__ 60 days
[0:42:09] Riqui__: @Riqui__ all or just 1?
[0:42:17] khlaah: Realistically, Den should only have 4 DAPs, the first 4 were Ruth I feel setting him up, was so fucked up she did that
[0:42:31] Juvraj: who you riding with, Duncan?
[0:42:33] BlindFlapjack: @BlindFlapjack LOOL what did he do?
[0:42:37] JoshDaDad: bro still defending his common sense judgement
[0:42:42] jesterconfit: @Sympathizee Yeah he's one of those cool cops who prioritizes RP than getting those wins
[0:42:42] Athasin: @getanime Yes, Slacks got shot after escorting a civ up north without backup (at least Den had Aziz) and he didn't DAP himself this is AFTER he DAP'd Den for "not using common sense"
[0:42:48] Kayklip: @Juvraj yes

[0:43:52] combattingjosh: yh, why isn't there a review for daps handed out?
[0:43:53] Athasin: @Panos_97 For Capts to get DAP'd they either have to DAP themselves, or 2 of the others agree to DAP him
[0:43:55] getanime: @Athasin i guess thats the profit being a captain
[0:43:56] Kayklip: duncan is giving not on our side Susge
[0:44:00] Athasin: @Badass_Hobo Exactly
[0:44:06] JxhnJxe: If Den gets fired, will Dean become a cop xd
[0:44:10] BlindFlapjack: What's the point of neutering one of the only cops that get's shit done??
[0:44:16] Superhank: police has made denzel regress
[0:44:24] akonv3: Duncan might be an op
[0:44:25] AUXY_1: @m4l1kkk okay lets be real, ofc they would. No one is getting fired from PD unless theyre doing something actually egregious
[0:44:28] m4l1kkk: They need to review themselves deansoP

[0:44:52] MikeACw: shouldn't get DAPs if something goes wrong the first time

[0:44:55] chmod_R_777: yea no warning, just DAPs

[0:44:59] dylanconlon6: everyone gets warnings u haven’t gotten any

[0:45:38] AUXY_1: @m4l1kkk Well the DAPs sure, but there is a BIG difference between DAPs and actually getting fired
[0:45:50] Cerkins: duncaning

[0:46:15] m4l1kkk: @auxy_1 2 IRL 24 hour suspensions, I wouldn't rule out being fired
[0:46:34] Athasin: @Gachiguru True, but the last few days K gets on, K tweets, Ruth disappears. Now, you can say it's coincidence...
[0:46:39] wispamii: yooo my boi
[0:46:52] Zev______: D:
[0:47:00] SpackJarrow23: tactical lol
[0:47:02] Superhank: ruth shook
[0:47:07] AUXY_1: @m4l1kkk I definitely would. the 24 hours suspensions is part of their guidelines. The firing isn't. 10 DAPs just is suspension pending review. And there is no way that review would end in firing atm

[0:53:47] captain_steve_420: @Faildude The thing is Ruth has a way of framing her conversations with the captains that paint people she wants to dap in the worst possible light, without even talking to them first about it. So of course the other captains agree to them, they trust Ruth when they shouldnt

[7:04:12] slomojosh: Jesus Christ that car on the straights
[7:04:14] LJD420: Suarez deserves captain, he should be shift 1 cap imo
[7:04:19] Cultivated: yall need bikes
[7:04:34] kellbean: who they chasing?
[7:04:43] slomojosh: so how do y’all get them off bikes?
[7:04:49] hammamer: @kellbean speedy sellers

[7:05:48] iDyex7: lol
[7:05:50] LJD420: @mutantzombie01 he streams everyday mainly in the day time too so his schedule would fit perfect for shift 1 imo
[7:05:58] BDG_Toa676: D:
[7:06:08] Jochem0000: @xsgem01 dont think he knows the routes or he is baiting something
[7:06:15] boosterronny: @slomojosh There's usually bike cops too

[7:06:50] xsgem01: @jochem0000 he could literally send it to mountain and he’s gone 1 tick escape
[7:06:56] slomojosh: same way just follow I guess
[7:06:59] LJD420: den would also be a good shift 1 cap since it fits his schedule but you know 9 daps KEKW
[7:06:59] wannabesimmer: LUL
[7:07:06] mutantzombie01: @ljd420 shift 1 starts like 3 hours before he normally wakes up he is a hybrid but I doubt he would want it any way cause it’s a lot of work and not enough chase
[7:07:15] ilostuniverse: Bit them when they turn with bike units
[7:07:16] Jochem0000: @xsgem01 yeah or just find a thight road
