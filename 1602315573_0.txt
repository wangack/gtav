[4:50:51] Grizzlocke: im liking rings of power, hopefully it starts picking up here
[4:50:54] TaroTartare: I thought it was really good
[4:50:54] Sciencegun: house of the dragon needs some zombies
[4:50:59] Vader: ^
[4:51:03] jawnwick99: Had to get a big battle and weird incest scene in there in the first couple episodes to get people sucked in

[4:51:16] ZeusOdinson: I didn't like the older Rhaenyra actor o3o
[4:51:17] RedtwoSB: it resets the suspense
[4:51:20] otisbdriftwood_: zombie dragons
[4:51:21] ManualBlinking: it's going to gain that momentum back, just sayin as a book reader
[4:51:28] Headss: When everybody is SO evil it's like..
[4:51:28] zeroevolved: NODDERS
[4:51:37] ZeusOdinson: Older Alicent's actor was cool thought NODDERS
[4:51:38] tedbear_85: It needs a major battle BUT in the dark so no one can see Kappa
[4:51:44] harrypooter00: It's practically still in it's prologue.
[4:51:44] ZurichDa: It's going too fast tbh but still enjoyable

[4:51:58] Brennanan: couldn't they just use makeup instead of an entire recast
[4:52:00] jackiebunz: Daemon as well
[4:52:02] 3xevilx: it was such a weird episode where it felt like nothing happening and everything happened all at once
[4:52:07] phodell: They should have aged him some fo sho
[4:52:09] Brodizzleee: I mean, 25-35?
[4:52:10] sinister_zhedan: @swiftwar_ Goodnight!
[4:52:10] RedtwoSB: hot knight is hot
[4:52:14] Sciencegun: he just aged well ofc
[4:52:18] TaroTartare: The King looking old was good
[4:52:19] kam_oner: no because they wil get even older @Brennanan
[4:52:26] zeroevolved: Daemon kinda looks the same tbh
[4:52:28] ZurichDa: I guess because those characters were children and the others were adults
[4:52:28] orangesol: deans world Sadge
[4:52:29] FoxConcerto: all them empty tents :(

[4:52:49] zeroevolved: the recast kinda took me out of last episode fr
[4:52:52] DudleyIsDumb: I’ve kind of realized that The Witcher may be the only video game that has had a none shit live action spin off show so far... holy fuck
[4:52:55] EvidentlyNova: Vizzy T looked fucked though LUL
[4:52:56] Grizzlocke: hows that new star wars show? I liked mando

[4:53:35] rezasprats: what did you think about the rings of power?
[4:53:41] ASomewhatLargeBabyRhino: Its already reminding me of the end of GoT with how many inconsistencies there are LUL
[4:53:44] ZurichDa: The Witcher series was not great but it is a low bar for game spin offs
[4:53:45] Bacn00: idk season 2 was iffy for witcher
[4:53:49] jawnwick99: @JBarlak I meant so far
[4:53:52] Vader: every game based on a film and every show based on a game sucks KEKW
[4:53:58] zeroevolved: King probably still getting it in his old age KEKW
[4:54:05] EvidentlyNova: @zeusodinson Alicent is the reason he didn't get punished, can't go against the Queen LUL
[4:54:07] JBarlak: @jawnwick99 too pieced together.
[4:54:12] shadowraptor7: im hoping tlou show will be good
[4:54:16] DudleyIsDumb: Like look at resident evil. It was actual horseshit
[4:54:19] baron_von_meijin: vader id agree except for the cyberpunk edgerunner. its really good
[4:54:21] juannari7: @DudleyIsDumb KEKLEO The major fuckup in that show was the removal of the different witcher schools
[4:54:22] wtheredaway: Arcane is an anomaly
[4:54:24] jei_kobu: @vader arcane and Edgerunners were amazing if ur counting animated series
[4:54:24] Vader: @shadowraptor7 travpiSufferKhars
[4:54:25] JackTehSippah: @Vader  The Warriors game on PS2 was actually really good and fun. it worked as a prequel to the movie too. But it was made by early Rockstar
[4:54:28] tedbear_85: anyone watching Rings of Power??
[4:54:28] CplDarkeye: @vader Edgerunners was wicked
[4:54:30] eldritchcarmine: lunaoCheerA *Bad Romance* lunaoCheerA
[4:54:31] DudleyIsDumb: @baron_von_meijin we are talking about live action
[4:54:32] zeroevolved: resident evil shows never turn out good
[4:54:34] Sciencegun: like laena velaryon for example. she hit the DBZ time chamber shit
[4:54:38] Vader: ive not watched edgerunners yet
[4:54:39] malourey: lunaoCheerA
[4:54:43] zeroevolved: Has anyone watched the cyberpunk show? Is it worth watching
[4:54:46] Vader: or arcane
[4:54:49] ASomewhatLargeBabyRhino: @Sciencegun OMEGALUL
[4:54:50] Grizzlocke: well the witch show is based off with more lore of the books, main thing they brought to the show from the games was handsome geralt instead of his actual in book ugly man
[4:54:52] Aeg_Chief: Edgerunners is godlike ngl
[4:54:55] zeroevolved: Arcane so good @vader
[4:54:57] CplDarkeye: @zeroevolved yes
[4:54:57] I9ead: @Vader its overhyped imo
[4:54:57] Aeg_Chief: game still mid tho KEKW
[4:54:59] Nemesix11: the witcher isn't based on the games its based on the books
[4:55:01] DudleyIsDumb: Edge runners is obviously good. It’s made by Studio Trigger lol
[4:55:01] phodell: 20 to 30, I lost all my head hair, and went from being able to a shitty beard to a full mane, the same age as Cole for example. That is a significant age period for change.
[4:55:02] Buzzabeel: It’s the adaption curse. For every 1 good show for a property there’s 10 shit ones.
[4:55:05] darrylop2: cyberpunk edgerunner was so freaking good
[4:55:05] tedbear_85: what about Castlevania? @Vader
[4:55:06] Brodizzleee: Arcane is good. Edgerunners is good.
[4:55:09] zeroevolved: @cpldarkeye bless thank u
[4:55:10] StumpsOnFire: @zeroevolved its pretty good. not as good as arcane but worth watching
[4:55:15] blankman99: @Vader i thought it  was fairly good
[4:55:19] Vader: never really gotten into anime though
[4:55:22] karrotkake0: edge runners was a great watch
[4:55:24] Naixoram: @Grizzlocke only the first season though. Season 2 of Witcher might as well be a whole new series for how much it diverges from the books
[4:55:24] JackTehSippah: Arcane is a legit 10/10.
[4:55:25] Aeg_Chief: Studio Trigger almost always has W's so it wasnt too surprising
[4:55:29] SirLonster: Edgerunners anime based off a game its so good uhnS
[4:55:31] zeroevolved: @stumpsonfire Arcane ending had me sad
[4:55:35] 0xygenhomie: can you believe CDPR wanted trigger to take rebecca out of the show
[4:55:38] Brodizzleee: @Vader Arcane is animation more than anime.
[4:55:44] Niney_Who: Edgerunners was one of the best shows Trigger made
[4:55:54] Buzzabeel: @oxygenhomie no idea why
[4:55:56] Encryptoh: lol
[4:55:57] I9ead: @Brodizzleee same thing is it not KEKW
[4:55:59] DudleyIsDumb: @vader trigger anime feels more western in a way? Idk. Kind of cartoony vibe from it
[4:56:00] Aeg_Chief: @oxygenhomie Literally not even surprsing coming from CDPR at this point KEKW
[4:56:02] Armin_Arlert73: @vader yea I never got into anime either jbtvClown
[4:56:03] zeroevolved: @vader idk I don’t really look at arcane as an anime because the art style is so different than most modern day anime
