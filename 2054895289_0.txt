[3:14:41] scha_de: Why do they not want to start the new turf with 4head or Ming on the app?
[3:15:08] Grapedactyl: @scha_de I think it's to be able to sell on multiple turfs at once
[3:16:28] zvidrvhim: Doubt you can push ndk there tho. Cuz the strain is tied to the turf
[3:16:32] scha_de: Shruge

[3:17:37] Bulfwyne: i'm not sure how selling strains work so idk. I thought you'd be able to see anything anywhere
[3:17:56] Grapedactyl: @ZvidRvhim True, so I think they're rying to have multiple group HQ's based on what theyve said

[3:33:17] AztecKniight: @NemisizZ I'm looking into govt work, just such a slow process.
[3:33:23] Grapedactyl: 4Head is literally a barrier to success lmao
[3:33:24] AztecKniight: At least from my experience
[3:34:14] NemisizZ: @AztecKniight it def can be, but the best is that there is no crunch or anything like that, you know how much u gonna be working and can plan ur life around that
[3:34:56] AztecKniight: That's what I'm looking for. Not crunching project by project.
[3:35:04] Capt_Schnitzel_: I work for an international company that stresses work-life balance.
[3:35:41] Capt_Schnitzel_: European ppl take like 6 weeks off at a time but then bitch at us in the USA if we take one day off.
[3:35:44] AztecKniight: My company had a good work/life balance but we just haven't signed a project in quite some time given the industry. So it was inevitable. Like I mentioned, at least they're giving me 2 months paid vacation lol
[3:36:02] AztecKniight: Time for a road trip
[3:36:05] scha_de: YAPPP

[3:38:09] Capt_Schnitzel_: @azteckniight I got laid off and kept working for the remaining two months. Actually worked in my favor. Went back to them in another role 2 years later and got my same benefits and tenure.
[3:38:37] NemisizZ: gov jobs is just more secure, they dont sack ppl just like that, unless u really screw up some how, which is a relief in it self not having to worry about whats gonna happen once the project is over
