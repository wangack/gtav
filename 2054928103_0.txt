[1:15:22] pyrocharlie: @ecler_chick if you have a high fever of 103+ on a child is very dangerous.
[1:15:28] solid_swede: Your body eventually acclimatises to the cold temperature

[1:16:22] golosopandisalta: Your temperature beeing high is the point, it helps you heal faster, unless its like crazy high

[1:18:42] neveranyluck: i take ice baths after my cancer treatments its the only thing that takes my headaches away since i cant take anything for them
[1:18:49] pyrocharlie: I had a neighbor when i was a kid who was 4yrs old and she had a high fever of 103, she had a stroke and passed away. The doctors told the mother she needed to put her in a cool bath to save her brain but obviously that advice was a lil late.
[1:18:54] Vlasvilneous: ooff, I hope they didnt brain their damage
[1:19:06] WitchenInTheKitchen: Ziggy telling me to hang in there helps ziggyjLove
[1:19:08] turtlebutterfly: My son was at 102 and had a seizure
