[0:26:30] Azzelix: I think we should experiment with and without text @Crayator
[0:26:30] NZD3MON: @MoneyTwit hello hru today
[0:26:34] Hydraa_: @tomitek19 shorts revenue is so ass compared to long form.
[0:26:36] caustic_salsa: goofy but not overstated
[0:26:39] CobrasEye66: hey chat
[0:26:40] officialredtiger: Cray what is ur vision for YT in the future. Are you gonna do the heist vids with the buds again?

[0:27:12] trackles_64: its the chidren who are wrong
[0:27:14] swifteyplayz: It cuz you have no moe
[0:27:15] caustic_salsa: Very true Joanna.
[0:27:22] xxDentwitchxx: Hmm
[0:27:22] Azzelix: @Crayator I think we need to change the text going forward. More like change to platinum and use different words
[0:27:23] MoneyTwit: time for the fortnite plat
[0:27:23] CobrasEye66: @caustic_salsa Always a pleasure Caustic
[0:27:24] ella_milne12: i think its gotta be consistency, and converting from fortnite and among us to a more adult audience
[0:27:29] JoannaWoodArt: just gotta keep at it
[0:27:31] caustic_salsa: Yeah the Fortnite ppl will go away but you'll get a new surge of variety watchers
[0:27:38] MoneyTwit: it'll take time for it to adjust
[0:27:38] officialredtiger: @Crayator Are you gonna do the heist vids with the buds again?
[0:27:39] caustic_salsa: @CobrasEye66 crayKissahomie  likewise man
[0:27:39] JoannaWoodArt: KEKW
[0:27:42] Hydraa_: how is the CTR of just those videos??
[0:27:45] Azzelix: Na I dont
[0:27:47] tomitek19: @Hydraa_ but using shorts in a way to capture retention on other posts and potential income streams is where its at. shorts is basically a huge ass funnel if u tweak it righ
[0:27:53] NZD3MON: @MoneyTwit glad to hear
[0:27:54] Kanthric: If all else fails, Cray, you could always try showing more cleavage.
[0:27:54] nessadamess: show us
[0:27:55] Hydraa_: oh it is 100% the old fortnite audience
[0:27:58] MoneyTwit: can I have cray100 :)

[0:28:44] MoneyTwit: no cap
[0:28:45] nessadamess: afcts
[0:28:45] Hydraa_: @tomitek19 yes but that just goes back to what you were saying, revenue with shorts is ass, but they lead to growing long form and other socials, which leads to earning revenue in those other things.
[0:28:45] JoannaWoodArt: brb Joel
