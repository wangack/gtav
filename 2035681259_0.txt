[8:18:16] jimothy64: Slowly draws everyone in the city, then the ducks become the 4.0 version of the NoPixel cards
[8:19:22] JoeayIV: you think you could draw ten ducks and hand that to Carlo instead of 10k?
[8:19:42] JoeayIV: just a bank transfer of 1$ and the note is an imgur link
[8:19:47] JoeayIV: "i paid you in NFTs"

[8:23:59] happy_questionmark: that better be a veggie burger
[8:24:00] Darth_hedgehog: more ducks nakkiCheer nakkiCheer nakkiCheer nakkiCheer

[8:26:57] nobodybodon: EZ
[8:27:57] jimothy64: Needs to be the jagged line they use to denote phonecalls for some reason
[8:28:18] JoeayIV: you could make Mickey a little bigger and then hide half of him behind the comic line
[8:28:22] nobodybodon: IDK if you have an idea in mind for swan but you could use peepoLost but a duck for her nodd

[8:44:19] nobodybodon: I think it was just "hey, can we talk/meet"
[8:44:25] JoeayIV: a heavy sigh i think
[8:44:27] nobodybodon: @JoeayIV ITS THE WRONG CHANNEL
[8:44:30] Jen848: something like I'll call you or text you later

[8:53:15] happy_questionmark: PepeHands
[8:53:18] jimothy64: You know, if Richard ever commissions himself as a duck, you should draw him as a duck-billed platypus instead..
[8:53:22] E_man369: ratJAM

[8:55:41] elkaskito: cath4Brk
[8:55:57] jimothy64: A platypus is a weird creature with some outward duck similarities, just as Richard is a weird creature with some outward person similarities :P
[8:56:00] Darth_hedgehog: nakkiNF
[8:56:21] Darth_hedgehog: nakkiSmile
[8:56:34] nobodybodon: nakkiMary is also you isn't it?

[8:57:37] MyTwitchName_: nakkiHug
[8:57:45] comeartmebro: you draw like you're drawing on paper
[8:58:34] happy_questionmark: maybe because you rotate the image?
[8:58:49] nobodybodon: You can draw on the walls with a marker, but then you get yelled at nodd
[8:59:17] KnightsWhoSayREE: nakkiSpy Don't you be drawing on the walls again Bodon. You know you're not allowed
[8:59:26] nobodybodon: do something about it
[8:59:30] nobodybodon: stinky knights
[9:00:04] KnightsWhoSayREE: tinyREE
[9:00:09] comeartmebro: yes, im traditionally a paper artist too, it's different on digital, best to try to do most lines in one continuous stroke, make every line flow into each other
[9:00:09] widemare: curvyeYoink  knight
[9:00:14] MisterParry: Duck Cartoons Really Quack Me Up KEKLEO

[9:04:26] MyTwitchName_: Phone by the head?
[9:04:40] nobodybodon: exactly as dramatic as it should be*
[9:04:44] JoeayIV: i think this is the 3k price point for ducks
[9:05:31] comeartmebro: im not trying to be a douche so please do take it that way but do you see the duck in the upper , do you see the broken line on it's under tail, if you had done that in one continuous stroke rather than many strokes it would look much smoother even if it didn't come out exactly as you had imagined
[9:06:23] nobodybodon: that part was actually re-drawn from another version of the duck
[9:06:35] nobodybodon: his butt was covered in the other one
[9:07:26] foxandthemoon: non perfect drawings make them more unique nakkiFlower
[9:07:45] jimothy64: They're essentially quick caricatures
[9:08:29] foxandthemoon: @jimothy64 she needs a booth at twitch con where she draws people as ducks
[9:08:59] jimothy64: Maybe have it be cut off, "Hey wanna-" and he cuts her off with his reply.. really drive it homd
[9:09:52] happy_questionmark: oh we know it's not perfect... she only has 4 apps on her phone but in actuality she has 6
[9:10:15] Jen848: Maybe this will get through to him
[9:10:55] JoeayIV: streamer
[9:10:58] JoeayIV: i gotta ask
[9:11:13] JoeayIV: is "Drive Usage" how much space you've used on the hard drive?
