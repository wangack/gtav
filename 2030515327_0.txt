[4:20:33] xMistressMayhem: Every Ounce of weed is illegal
[4:20:40] JediJacob_: @Super_EJ theres different tiers though based on possession amount
[4:20:59] xMistressMayhem: @harrison6286 Indeed, this is highly questionable
[4:21:35] Kittriss: Bulge on pat down maybe
[4:21:41] CBS_Kong: it's the inventory weight, imo its a lack of description in thegame rn
[4:21:41] xMistressMayhem: Im assuming she patted down for a weapon?
[4:21:44] Lyoniscute: Wait 42 kg is 21 pounds right I can't remember the conversion iz

[4:22:28] FlameReetardantPanda: well they're weed bags, right, so it's not just grams, but the weight is just the inventory weight
[4:22:29] sBuon: sniffthenewchatter
[4:22:29] harrison6286: that’s just over 5 7 month old babies
[4:22:34] diurnambull86: @Lyoniscute 22 pounds is 10kg
