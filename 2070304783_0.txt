[0:30:27] StubbsPKS: It's already blowing the doors off most of the cars I've been able to actually find in the last week, so being able to squeeze it makes sense

[0:33:53] StubbsPKS: This feels decent especially for a first pass on live. Well done man
[0:34:03] bloody_model: Hey
[0:34:08] secret_passengerr: My opinion is that this car should be secondary
[0:34:17] bmcloughlin22: it looks soooo good
[0:34:52] SirSaltyBacon: yeah that is perfect. the uphills on the highway is what kills the scout
[0:34:54] secret_passengerr: not even 120 Classic
[0:34:57] SirSaltyBacon: so this is making me so happy
[0:35:07] StubbsPKS: I actually like where the cars are. 115-120 is basically the top end and even going that fast is a big deal
[0:35:20] mobstagta: gtawiseguy thoughts on hard cuffs dampening the 2nds possible getaway there? Sadge
[0:35:23] StubbsPKS: It's great so far

[6:48:12] Nejderz: Would I be that bad if lead of the units would have to be interviewed/apply for it?
[6:48:25] Nejderz: maybe that already done
[6:48:48] BritishDawg: Yooo man, whats your opinions on a gang going after PD (we know we will lose in the end) ???
[6:49:52] MrSym: Why would your gang choose to go after PD?
[6:50:05] BritishDawg: being harrased on our turf
[6:50:21] X4320: @MrSym Pogs/Minute, duh
[6:50:55] MrSym: Shruge
[6:52:08] MrSym: Gangs going after PD just ends up being not fun for most people who get targeted
[6:52:15] MrSym: Atleast from what I've seen historically
[6:52:39] coyotes____: true
[6:53:28] BritishDawg: hmmm I mena NGL we are gonna end up worse from it as the PD will win, as that is how it should be
[6:53:40] BritishDawg: "win"
[6:53:50] coyotes____: 4Shrug but you can try it i guess
[6:53:53] MrSym: I'm not saying don't do it, my opinion ultimately carries no weight at all
[6:54:17] BritishDawg: I just wanna know if its something the community is looking to go
[6:54:20] MrSym: I think you just have to make sure you ensure both sides can get RP from it, as opposed to just blasting at every opportunity NODDERS
[6:54:47] Lytsu: This should all be done in RP and have actual reasonings behind it. Discussing it OOC means nothing.
[6:54:47] BritishDawg: oh we will make sure its not just pulling up and shooting
[6:55:19] coyotes____: be prepared for the consequences too NODDERS
[6:55:23] BritishDawg: @Lytsu im asking the community as we are here to make content and if its something people do not wanna see whats the point
[6:55:38] JunkyWRX: I wouldn't go into RP situations with the thought process of who's gonna "win". I would look through the lense of what type of RP is this going to create.
[6:55:38] Lytsu: It's not a content server. It's an RP server. RP comes first
[6:55:40] BritishDawg: but i also get what your saying
[6:55:42] MrSym: People always enjoy seeing Gang vs PD RP
[6:55:59] Nejderz: if people who are involved in the rp enjoys it, the audience usually follows along
[6:56:05] MrSym: YEP
[6:56:08] Agathon_nl: need that testosterone YEP
[6:56:10] Nejderz: So keep that always in mind
[6:56:28] MrSym: If you have any concerns, feel free to open up an admin ticket on the ONX discord @BritishDawg
[6:57:04] coyotes____: pepeTHAT they fast with a ticet NODDERS
[6:57:06] BritishDawg: yeah i know we will keep it within rules and do some good things RP wise with it, we dont wanna just shoot
[6:57:11] JunkyWRX: Yeah, an admin ticket might be good in this situation @britishdawg. Since what you're trying to do here is gauge if the community is ready for this type of RP
[6:57:31] MrSym: Just make sure you target Junky's cop NODDERS
[6:57:36] MrSym: PepeLa
