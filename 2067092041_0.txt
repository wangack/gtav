[4:46:28] frozonhawk: you can probably still do both later down the line, might be harder to do the business after as it would cost to get expunged
[4:47:30] lollygagger808: it sounds like if you put it in your name then want to transfer it it will be another 50k for that person to get a license also correct
[4:49:14] lollygagger808: won’t they have there own business if they have a business license
[4:49:24] KingTurtleThc: 100 % if you get caught    you can  tell  mickey  it was dundees fault SeemsGood
[4:50:11] frozonhawk: i can see swan making sure she is financially stable before risking herself, and being a big time business owner underground crime boss would be cool
[4:51:07] josiahju: yea isn’t expungement 100k

[4:54:09] Nightbot: Crystal is playing on a heavily modified private roleplaying server for GTA5 on PC. The whitelisted server is called NoPixel, using the FiveM client. You can find out more at fivem.net and nopixel.net Please note that only donation applications are open, this does not guarantee acceptance.
[4:55:48] frozonhawk: a plus about waiting to do crime, is more will come out and swan could do some of the bigger stuff later
