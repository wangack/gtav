[1:38:50] Luvasus: @Kyle Counsel and council are pronounced the same, but they have different (though related) meanings. Counsel is a verb meaning “advise” and a noun meaning “advice” or “instruction.” It can also be used as a noun to refer to a lawyer. Council is a noun referring to an advisory or legislative body of people.
