[1:09:30] eqnjn: Taurus has best handling for sure
[1:09:35] Krimson07_: i like the explorer tbh
[1:09:35] marneraiders: For the city yes, for the highway VSTR
[1:09:37] MWRGaming: would be a better car if it had a turbo
[1:09:46] Artsii1994: i think its best for like in the city patrol

[1:10:31] dakota22446: pepeS
[1:10:32] Deviii_: seems like the cadillac was the better allrounder there
[1:10:38] wintersoldier2712: speed should atleast be increased by maybe 10-15 mph
[1:10:48] eqnjn: I think Taurus for LSPD and the Buffalo for BCSO interceptors makes perfect sense
[1:10:49] Jaster_Reylu: explorer is a good one for city and offroad too
[1:10:59] wavep987: Can cops put out warrants for cars? Flag plates and give owners option to surrender?

[1:35:39] 1Tesla1: 1 dap should be max that can be given for anything...thats if they are being used for learning and not just straight out punishment. if someone does some thing so bad then they should be suspended

[3:25:27] FinexLive: Evilowo
[3:25:31] Absoroot: Kinda curious about your thoughts on gangs heavily snitching. Obviously gangs snitching on each other is super beneficial to your character but how do you feel about it on an OOC level? I know you did a lot of RDR2 rp and gangs just go toe to toe with each other for the most part there.
[3:25:33] nigh8wolf: Berric said JP had two guns right?

[3:34:12] ratirl_plays_variety_: @Pocateyo that can be forged so easy
[3:34:14] eqnjn: How is there not enough PC to go for at least a BOLO for JP
[3:34:16] SXR9: @adshotta how can they prove it wasnt his items
[3:34:37] looperskiz: @Pocateyo yea but anyone could impersonate the note
[3:34:38] Absoroot: @SXR9 bank transactions, no?

[3:34:56] magnets_: OMEGALUL
[3:34:56] FizzDidThis: PauseChamp
[3:34:59] xolision: will it hold up in court if the only material he has is what they reported? kind of unbelievable that he owns nothing.
[3:35:00] saifallah___: @adshotta well also if the cops searched his apartment due to the gun charge and a ton of GPU racks are found and it makes sense with the report about the stolen ones that would also greatly improve the chances to win the case ig thats why they snitched on the gun
[3:35:01] taraannee: the word rizz makes me want to ocean dump myself
[3:35:01] M3disyn: saabC i've retired

[3:35:10] FinexLive: !meta
[3:35:11] StreamElements: Please do not meta in chat, which means do not tell Saab stuff happening in RP that his character would otherwise not know.

[3:35:34] Heyyouitsmcmuffin: I’m the notest sadge
[3:35:35] adshotta: @saifallah1337 yes jp having so many racks in his apt would be evidence
[3:35:45] VtuberLoverAlways: W slacks t10LESGO
[3:35:47] tbilisi: @ratirl_plays_variety_ technically it was in otts house, so he relinquished his ownership coz its in his house

[3:35:52] PlanetPluto718: power walk LuL
[3:35:55] MisterParry: surely there's loads of evidence to prove they own the racks. They would have been buying tons of materials, so there should be a record there.
[3:35:55] looperskiz: no proof of anything really
[3:35:58] NSAne93: great RP
[3:36:00] ratirl_plays_variety_: There's noway this goes anywhere
[3:36:05] Knightsofblood: @adshotta  no thats not evidence, theres no proof that its their racks and not his own
[3:36:05] TheTourist_: KEKWalk
[3:36:06] buddha_hands: interestinggg
[3:36:07] Nijumaa: Also impossible to prove they are actually the racks and gpus from the company house
[3:36:10] magnets_: YEP same
[3:36:13] escokitty: great RP though
[3:36:14] Bobbobolob: he doesn't know PepeLaugh
[3:36:15] xolision: will it hold up in court if the only equipment he has is what they reported? kind of unbelievable that he owns nothing. he took 50%
[3:36:18] Kevz95: yeah but its gonna be so good PepeLaugh
[3:36:19] robin1904: They are dad gum criminal scum SHITSHOW
[3:36:22] PlumptiousPear: went to sleep as JP, woke up as X
[3:36:24] adshotta: @knightsofblood he left a note saying he did a house heist
[3:36:25] Faildude: yeah they farmed 18h / day for 40 days and all gone
[3:36:25] MisterParry: True. Good for RP, but it seems excessive
[3:36:25] juliaweismann: rug pulled :(
[3:36:27] Knightsofblood: Yes, it feels bad, but its adding abunch of RP for them, hunting him down and stuff
[3:36:27] Absoroot: and they bailed him outa his 60k fines debt too FeelsBadMan But you're not wrong the rp is spicy now
[3:36:32] Hcrazii: IC everyone shocked he left anything
[3:36:33] dylanconlon6: How mickey speaks it’s so interesting
[3:36:33] eqnjn: Thousands of man hours from tens of peoples ripped away by single person, yeaj
[3:36:33] infintitedream: as long a X roles with what happens next right
[3:36:37] saifallah___: the RP is great but a group loosing like 1500hrs of playtime always feels harsh OOC
[3:36:37] PolygonStatic: YEP wouldn't be as spicy if they didnt get screwed so bad
[3:36:40] lotusdroplet: @xolision he took more than 50
[3:36:41] walkgleesh: not he said she said when one side has 4+ witnesses
[3:36:44] Hinten97: He created rp for half of the server yeah
[3:36:45] Knightsofblood: @adshotta  that doesnt mean anything though, again, thats not enough evidence to prove anything
[3:36:48] taginor: They grinded every day, they worked so hard. I was there when the first person found out. I actually felt bad irl. @Ssaab
[3:36:49] Heyyouitsmcmuffin: x can’t afford all that shit so how can he prove he owns it
[3:36:50] StreamElements: Please do not meta in chat, which means do not tell Saab stuff happening in RP that his character would otherwise not know.
[3:36:51] pooped: @xolision Not possible to prove who bought what and what agreements there were.
[3:36:54] xolision: @lotusdroplet how so, both groups are generating about 25butcoin each
[3:36:56] ArdentCause: literally
[3:36:58] escokitty: 😂
[3:36:58] Kevz95: @xolision how did he get all of that company equipment? is there receipts of him buying all that? is it believable that it was all "given" to him?
[3:37:00] tigimci: yeah they got fucked a little too hard
[3:37:00] robin1904: There has to be ups and downs in RP
[3:37:01] medium_5: ye they took it really hard, was some strong ooc feelings for sure
[3:37:06] adshotta: @knightsofblood that's up to the court to decide
[3:37:07] Knightsofblood: @Heyyouitsmcmuffin   in rp , he doesnt know that
[3:37:10] DARYLO_: put on cam and do that voice again you wont 4Head
[3:37:12] WildWillie419: that’s also life Sadge

[3:37:12] juliaweismann: true
[3:37:13] 8uky1: for real
[3:37:14] ArdentCause: its RP thats the point of this game you grind and play for the storyline
[3:37:14] simplyakaa: with that mentality it kills RP
[3:37:14] PolygonStatic: RP not MMORPG NODDERS
[3:37:16] kilugradi: yeah but its difficult not to feel like shit
[3:37:16] keyziiy: there has to be consequences to stealing 600k+ worth of items
[3:37:18] 1ivoni: TRUE
[3:37:18] Th3Ch0: just dont be friends w jp lul
[3:37:19] twitchisbaaad: No Ls in RP

[3:37:20] VADICKUS007: I thought house robberies are against the rules
[3:37:21] vomitandote: yeah, so many chatters have gone unhingeed over this amazing content
[3:37:22] irussu: To be fair there's no receipts that the company bought them too Shrug
[3:37:25] FinexLive: but isn't that real life also?
[3:37:26] tbilisi: then house robberies should be on the table
[3:37:26] MisterParry: Ray__C had a 40 day sub-a-thon, idk, I feel bad
[3:37:27] taginor: True, but sometimes the betrayal is so hardcore, that its difficult to cut off any emotions
[3:37:29] APE_KlNG: facts
[3:37:31] irussu: It's a he said she said
[3:37:32] Faildude: I mean he can but you can be upset too it's like if in an mmo someone steal your shit after you grinded hard
[3:37:32] shanejo127: Agree that doesn't make it easy to do when grinding
[3:37:33] oOT9o: its his character too, he is a goblin
[3:37:33] juliaweismann: @twitchisbaaad unless you're no RPing
[3:37:33] 1ivoni: Not an MMORPG
[3:37:35] Nijumaa: If RP only had its ups it would be boring
[3:37:38] juliaweismann: not*
[3:37:38] Knightsofblood: @adshotta  yes, but unless they have evidence to back up how much they had and how much he stole, its not a strong case. and they did not have much of evidence on that
[3:37:43] irussu: Nerd
