[1:48:52] redwolf10k: If you appeal to a more casual demographic, that could lead to the heart of the server (die-hard viewers and streamers) leaving. Which could kill the server.
[1:48:53] xerozeroo8: @uberhaxornova what about the cow god?
[1:48:58] 80b101: Look at siz coke arc right now isn that the biggest Pog's ever?
