[1:55:32] kyle_says_hello: I just think that if you get a job and you don't like it you can't do something way different cuz u didn't do business or engineering in school
[1:55:36] shadowless_warrior: teaching money and cooking should be mandatory

[1:58:25] ya_boi_turbo: kinda speaks to the fact that people change their careers or things they think they want to do a TON so early specialization in education sets people up to burn out and ultimately not be able to do anything else if their interests change
[1:58:27] Mikoloro_: My counseling courses has served me well in life.

[5:37:02] oxygenIess: if it's no more than 2, then 2
[5:37:05] ariana9004: nowadays short form content took over bc tiktok and shit
[5:37:07] pieman3242: more consistent upload for algorithm
[5:37:10] nathnN: yeah its basically a playthrough at that point
[5:37:11] creepinggamer123: no 3 parts
[5:37:12] ughitssophie: honestly no reason to have two parts if the whole video would be less than 1 hour anyway
[5:37:13] alpha_breed7: 2
[5:37:15] rizzl_me_this: 1
[5:37:16] Darleksec64: realsed at the same time?
[5:37:17] Nightbot: Want to know when we go live/updates? Check out the Twitter over here: twitter.com/crayator
[5:37:19] headless_turkey: longer videos feel like more of a commintment for the video
[5:37:31] Finikith: are you gonna upload the parts in one day? or how would that work? cause personally, i hate to wait for many parts
[5:37:38] ErnieSKZ: gota make sure its cosistent
[5:37:40] sammy050799: yes
[5:37:41] nathnN: what part do you think will do better
[5:37:43] Insane__08: Doesn‚Äôt hurt to see if YouTube will like it or not
[5:37:44] creepinggamer123: YES!!!!
[5:37:50] Bearsilverman14: I personally like one long one
[5:37:54] chloelicious96: You might actually be able to include more in the video if you do it in parts
[5:37:55] lovelypho: thats perfect
[5:37:58] Insane__08: I like the longer style
[5:38:06] Finikith: NODDERS
[5:38:08] bomberandy: good way to seperate solo and online
[5:38:08] thenucleurist: For an achievement video I don't want to comeback and watch a second video a few days later. I want to see it all in the one video.
[5:38:10] ughitssophie: longer is better imo unless you're approaching 2.5 hours plus
[5:38:11] Nyl93__: NODDERS
[5:38:14] lovelypho: Have you thought of making shorts ?
[5:38:16] oxygenIess: if you have the structure down at the time, I absolutely think 1 video. But the reason people are clicking off is because it's too long and you didn't have the structure
[5:38:18] ughitssophie: NODDERS
[5:38:21] dumbbeast7: good thing tbh
[5:38:22] ariana9004: NODDERS yeah
[5:38:25] Insane__08: most vids I watch on YouTube r over 20 mins
[5:38:33] dumbbeast7: tiktok content need to stay on that platform not cross to youtube Aware
[5:38:34] lovelypho: I love when I get into a pt 1 and theres a part 2 i can contuine watching
[5:38:34] creepinggamer123: longer is one thing hour is another
[5:38:52] AaronRheins: Back to vlogs and stuff
[5:38:53] ughitssophie: NODDERS yep
[5:38:56] AaronRheins: Sam Sulek lol
[5:38:59] SublimePNG: its really interesting seeing what works on YT change over the years
[5:39:01] Gugety27: fair
[5:39:02] oxygenIess: it definitely feels more complete in 1 video.
[5:39:04] Nyl93__: oooooh
[5:39:09] DaaenV_: my recommended videos are 25mins-5hrs
[5:39:15] Ginoveli: swedisPig
[5:39:16] ughitssophie: i think its ironic to not have a completionist video not be complete in one
[5:39:30] Insane__08: Doesn‚Äôt hurt to test it
[5:39:32] Darleksec64: for me i dont care if it 60 mins or two 30 mins videos
[5:39:39] ughitssophie: NODDERS
[5:39:41] chloelicious96: Trial and error I guess
[5:39:44] ThatsAndrewToYou: was going to say, you get equal views on two vids you get double ads? helps the algorithm that people are watching more content
[5:39:45] 1benh1: ima watch all the videos no matter how long they are anyways
[5:39:48] creepinggamer123: you need to get people to make a transition.
[5:39:51] RedEyedJedi1992: yeah cliffhanger
[5:39:52] alpha_breed7: upload the whole play through and the 2 videos
[5:40:00] jackrabbit567: If you make the the video is going to be like a 4 hours one video
[5:40:11] naymew_: i feel like neither of them is a bad option
[5:40:11] oxygenIess: if you have the structure down at the time, I absolutely think 1 video, but the other videos, people are clicking off is because it's too long and you didn't have the structure. Without the structure it's hard for people to commit.
[5:40:18] dumbbeast7: short attention spans gg
[5:40:18] b4_dusk: Why not upload you first play through on a second channel and then the platinum run on the main channel?
[5:40:21] dumbbeast7: from tiktok brainrot
[5:40:21] creepinggamer123: they don't
[5:40:22] dumbbeast7: jk
[5:40:22] oxygenIess: There's a big risk you half your viewership because they dont come back, compared to 1 video
[5:40:25] Darleksec64: i do that but i dont click off i leave it up
[5:40:27] HKonOverwatch: I do that
[5:40:28] headless_turkey: yh they have to commit the whole 50 mins
[5:40:37] rsyncd: Another day at the office for Trev MmmHmm
[5:40:39] ughitssophie: it's gonna take trial and error probably but you'll find your grove
[5:40:41] creepinggamer123: @ThatsAndrewToYou really true
[5:40:42] Gugety27: I'm guilty of this. I click a video, and I'm like "yeah I'll finish it later", and then I never do
[5:40:48] NosAU: afternoon all FeelsOkayMan
[5:40:49] Mikoloro_: once I click off a Part 1, it is iffy that I come back for Part 2.
[5:40:53] blade_killa: nos MLADY
[5:40:54] Insane__08: Yeah when u see vids with 2 parts the second part can have half or less of the views of the first
[5:40:55] oxygenIess: I think it would be more likely people a month after view both back2back than watching it at release.
[5:40:56] ughitssophie: MLADY nos
[5:40:56] Nightbot: ello gov'ner MLADY

[5:43:37] TechTronTV: Ive watched the elden ring vid like 3x and it still pops up on my recommended
[5:43:40] Ginoveli: if youtube stamps it then it'll be suggested all over
[5:43:40] Nyl93__: NODDERS
[5:43:42] fillmyvoid: nah that's silly, the stream and youtube are advertising for each other

[5:47:02] oxygenIess: Like 1% of YouTube viewers is going to go and watch vods.
[5:47:03] WherezzWally: you said this a bit ago but people always ask why we don‚Äôt upload patreon videos before the youtube vids. it‚Äôs because we‚Äôd miss 30k views lol

[5:47:45] WattiesSauce: Does twitch monetise vods at all?
[5:47:53] chloelicious96: I find the vods too long to catch up on sometimes so I don‚Äôt tend to watch them back like that
[5:48:06] creepinggamer123: true
[5:48:07] ughitssophie: it just sucks if you're a regular viewer and you miss one stream
[5:48:17] trackles_64: You sounds like an EA exec
