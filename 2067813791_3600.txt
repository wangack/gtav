[1:00:15] raenala_: oh no wonder KEKW
[1:00:18] GD_Kotorou: You ever played Fallout, Kiva? monkaHmm
[1:00:38] symptms: so now with the Grime/G6 meta coming and going it's more relevant than ever OMEGALUL
[1:01:07] Tyler4AM: She's says corny, not horny as Kansas in August right. Cause I swear every time I hear horny and idk what that says about me
[1:01:22] elvic_: beetle13Cozy
[1:01:30] DentonTYoung: kivaHi
[1:01:38] Random_Slacker: its like 960 to axel for a full lumber run at 3 per.. so if your just speedrunning low quality it aint terrible.. and no extra steps
[1:01:41] primebastionstrats: listening to this makes me wanna boot up new vegas and mod again kivaSmile
[1:01:52] Tyler4AM: Listen, summers back then were probably wild ok
[1:01:58] WickedTortuga: Kansas farmers make do.
[1:02:00] symptms: judging from Reed's stream, the moonshine runs are quite enjoyable compared to other similar jobs
[1:02:28] inus2: yeah was also gonna say low qual runs seem to be okay money
[1:02:50] NoManners: @WickedTortuga  kivaHAHA
[1:03:10] Thrath: If you can get an average recipe and get a good supply of ingredients pumping out that as much as possible would be solid money too to split between personal and gang
[1:03:36] Random_Slacker: and if jack still buys lumber, any extra is also still good.. even if he overcharges when selling it
[1:03:52] symptms: the furniture pipeline did seem frustrating for no real reason
[1:04:03] Tyler4AM: To be fair it must be tough to make small talk down here
[1:04:05] lord_dragox412: The air is too thick, doesn't carry soundwaves well Kappa
[1:04:10] Tyler4AM: "So....smell like shit down here huh"
[1:04:43] squoogelol: wouldnt be so bad if every blueprint for house stuff was a lot easier to get
[1:05:03] monstersbelow: it seems set up to encourage specialist decorating businesses, but i don't know if there's businesses like that yet
[1:05:09] symptms: especially as an exclusively creative outlet, rather than "progression"
[1:06:14] discardedDigit: I don't think many of the houses are actually crafting walls and floors. People must just be buying them. They are so cheap at UTool.
[1:06:32] lord_dragox412: The furniture is such a pointless money sink. People who want to RP become poor, grinders who don't decorate their house stay rich LUL
[1:07:44] Tyler4AM: Am just not a fan of it being a double headache, the fact that you have to grind to design your house is doubly frustrating when the design tool is also scuffy and requires you to have to redo your progress multiples throughout the process
[1:08:15] Tyler4AM: It's tedious
[1:08:44] lord_dragox412: Scuffy and lacks many QoL features that will never be added NODDERS
[1:09:04] Tyler4AM: I mean there's literally only so much time in the day lol. At some point there's gotta be RP in between somewhere
[1:09:27] Thrath: I'm just curious where tap water and the fx material is gonna come from KEKW
[1:09:32] wizardiis: roleplay is kinda cringe though peepoGiggles
[1:09:49] inus2: from what ive seen from other povs people just blast music down here, they might not even hear you at all
[1:10:08] Thrath: There is some non logical steps for certain materials it seems
[1:10:22] Tyler4AM: I was really excited for Guber because I thought that would be a fun early civ job where cars were scarce and people would have to interact with drivers to get around the city. Sad that it didn't pan out that way
[1:10:24] inus2: most crims seem to not like the sewers cause they put so much required down here like the fence kivaLUL
[1:10:31] aconfused_melon: that’s a good question
[1:10:32] discardedDigit: Gotta pray for the water blueprint in the crafting gamble.
[1:11:03] Tyler4AM: Let's keep the criticism constructive, chat
[1:11:11] raenala_: kivaCozy
[1:13:00] inus2: well stanley has a 6th sense for trees, maybe everyone has one for something kivaSus
[1:14:14] monstersbelow: all i hear is fallout

[1:46:25] Tyler4AM: I was gonna say a rhino but I guess that's pretty self explanitory
[1:46:54] wizardiis: I found a top ten list
[1:47:21] wizardiis: 10 is horse surprisingly
[1:47:42] zeman94: First three on Google are elephant horse kangaroo
[1:47:55] wizardiis: 9 Sloth, 8 human, 7 polar bear, 6 squid, 5 giraffe, 4 hippo, 3 elephant, 2 wolf, 1 shark
[1:47:56] SushiShad: if you’ve ever tried to draw a horse from memory…
[1:48:12] wizardiis: This list may be flawed kivaLUL
[1:48:34] Rablit: your mascot but just sliiiiiiiightly color adjusted to piss people off. Now that's cursed.
[1:48:56] SushiShad: definitely depends on if you’re trying to draw realistic or stylised
[1:48:56] Tyler4AM: You can't have a top ten animals list and then include human smh

[1:55:46] honor234567: kivaSuffer
[1:55:53] Tyler4AM: I feel like at that point it would likely break off into sub groups, but that might be overly dooming
[1:56:24] inus2: might be good to have that convo sooner rather than later though right? in case people just vanish one day kivaLUL
[1:56:27] aconfused_melon: nobody is gonna do that, you’ve already seen it in 3.0
[1:56:36] honor234567: NANA will lead kivaCheer
[1:56:42] aconfused_melon: it’ll just fizzle out NODDERS
[1:56:47] Tyler4AM: Idk if there's anyone in the gang currently that really fits that tbh. And if you outsourced it I think it would just lead to a merger/another group absorbing the rest of the members
[1:57:35] Tyler4AM: Yeah hopefully that's a ways down the line NODDERS
[1:57:45] inus2: could be an opportunity for a fun non-grinding thing for people in the group to do also, have an 'hoa leadership academy' kind of like a game show or something to train the next leader out of interested people kivaLUL
[1:59:04] NoManners: NODDERS
[1:59:11] lblvckmvgicl: NODDERS
[2:00:02] Tyler4AM: It's a tough situation where you want to be able to do things as a group, but also want the group to thrive as a whole, and the latter half of that involves a good amount of individualistic grinding
[2:00:35] Ashtahh: If people get the feeling that the group has an expiration date then they’ll just not contribute and it’ll domino into it dying. I say the sooner you address it the better but it is a shit situation
[2:00:47] aconfused_melon: just enjoy while you still can Aware
[2:01:00] Figueronie: I'm praying that once the 50 coin a day thing is achieved, people chill with the amount of grinding and just have fun for a bit
[2:01:48] Tyler4AM: I think the wishful thinking part of me would hope that by that time the Paleto vision is able to actually come into fruition, that would at least help to alleviate the problem a little bit
[2:01:49] PeachTwirl: maybe it transforms to something like the current government and has a council
[2:01:55] Tyler4AM: Wouldn't necessarily need a leader at that point
[2:02:31] LolmanScott: what even is the vision anymore?
[2:02:37] Tyler4AM: Yeah ik, but I think that's also a product of people having to focus almost entirely on their own groups
[2:02:51] Tyler4AM: Yeah
[2:03:14] zachlaflare: the mmopixel grind pengwinSuffer
[2:03:45] Figueronie: Yeah the first mentality applied to the server as a whole does put a damper on creativity kivaSuffer
[2:03:45] aconfused_melon: Everyone is on the server is just focusing on grinding, but it’s not their faults because that’s how the server is supposed to played. SHRUGGERS
[2:03:46] bartxn: it seems the grinding has kind of beaten people down, everyone's so focused on themselves and just getting by that it's hard to think about doing something fun or 'nonproductive'
[2:05:06] Tyler4AM: Andi as a character was incredibly interesting at the start of 3.0 and a lot of that is because of the insane work you put in, but honestly outside of that I don't think the start of it was great either tbh
[2:05:13] Tyler4AM: 3.0 I mean
[2:05:47] LaochCeltach: feels like thats whole city most people i watch its groups talking about money or others not working hard enough
[2:05:55] bartxn: ^
[2:06:31] zachlaflare: everybody is stuck in the grinding loop and it leaves no room for stories to even unfold
[2:06:48] fundead121: I feel like we're missing out on the RP "arcs" that we had that made 3.0 stories so memorable.
[2:06:49] Figueronie: 100%

[2:07:37] Tyler4AM: My main issue is that slowburn is absolutely the right mentality to have, but it should be focused on RP not progression. I wish that a lot of the jobs were more interaction friendly instead of encouraging grinding
[2:07:48] wizardiis: kivaSmile
[2:07:49] Figueronie: Yeah the scoreboard stuff pushes people away
[2:07:49] aconfused_melon: Madge call them out
[2:08:04] aconfused_melon: don’t let them strong arm you and everyone else
[2:09:01] lowbow_: the goal post keeps moving
[2:09:25] Ashtahh: Kinda loops back into the siz being the leader but nobody knows what’s going on because you have ask him or Erin
[2:09:28] WickedTortuga: kivaSuffer
[2:09:29] TraumaLlama: Sometimes you just gotta think outside the box, Like the phone book.. Grinding/progression is in all rp servers, But finding the outside of the box "progression" like the phone box can keep it interesting.
[2:09:29] wizardiis: KEKW
[2:09:31] MacabreOS: what happens if you take heist off the table and everything stops going towards it, do that open things up for silly ?
[2:09:35] lowbow_: kivaHAHA
[2:09:40] Doxin55: kivaLUL
[2:09:56] LolmanScott: lot of this is how it's gonna be!!! (unless it's not)
[2:10:15] LaochCeltach: feel like few people just check out and don't want to deal with it
[2:10:23] bartxn: it seems like they maybe *tried* to force interaction with some jobs, like some things only coming from certain jobs so you have to talk to people, but it has just ended up with more transactional interactions instead of fostering rp
[2:10:42] Tyler4AM: Yeah it becomes an issue of feeling like the grinding is an absolute necessity and the mechanics are doing more to prop that up instead of other creative RP solutions

[2:19:31] Anrisacia: So I have a question: Earlier you said that the early 3.0 grind you were ok with because it felt like it was leading to things you could look forward to. Do you feel that's the same case now where the grind will pay off at some point?
[2:20:51] Tyler4AM: I think the farmer's market and Dean's world did a lot of heavy lifting for civ businesses early on
[2:21:11] Vizi797: You were kinda fielding the entire server's creativity from the mayor's office too. Businesses, PD requests of things, city hall, etc.
[2:21:48] Tyler4AM: I remember on the civ side things were fairly solid at the start of 3.0 and a lot of that was because of you being mayor, but the crime side was rough
[2:22:31] Ashtahh: Yeah the early HOA 3.0 crime stuff was bad
[2:22:38] Figueronie: ^
[2:23:05] Figueronie: 2 hours of meth beta testing then straight to cop kivaLUL
[2:23:47] MacabreOS: was fishing out on the water an early 3.0 thing?
[2:23:56] Tyler4AM: Ye you could fish
[2:24:01] Tyler4AM: Siz hated it
[2:24:14] aconfused_melon: The beta testing was awful. because at one moment you’re progressing and then you’re set back the next day OMEGALUL
[2:24:21] tyrelrahl: Yeah it's tough for a solo person to get a house.  There's an EMS I watch that's solo saving up for a decent house, and even with being on duty it's a long time away.  But it's like you said, people have to put in the work.
[2:24:42] whyiamso: @Tyler4AM Fishing would be great rn...imagine tossing a fish at a cop lol
[2:25:21] Vizi797: That was probably one of the best chases I've ever seen when he did that KEKW
[2:26:23] Tyler4AM: I just picture if it was a cartoon, the fish would've hit Tessa in the face as she was driving and it would've peeled off to reveal her with a deathly grimace
