[0:42:43] imdiggingyou: like high profile cases judges wouldn't allow cellphones and recording devices?
[0:43:19] Rahjoth: Maybe. Not necessarily. It depends on the circumstance. Those are more likely to attract media attention, which would have lots of recording devices.

[4:22:05] Aiden: it's okay brober we see you've changed
[4:22:08] Aiden: we're so proud of you
[4:22:14] Broberown: A bus is nothing like a truck fym
[4:22:20] Aiden: ???
[4:22:25] Broberown: Where in the truck is the dozens of passenger space
[4:22:32] Aiden: where the trailer would be
[4:22:37] Broberown: you said WITHOUT a trailer
[4:22:43] Aiden: yes so dont put a trailer
[4:22:46] Aiden: put the rest of the bus there
[4:23:14] ChillR2: A car is just two motorcycles together then
[4:23:21] Broberown: so you're saying that
[4:23:25] Aiden: no its not because the steering is locked together ChillR2
[4:23:26] Broberown: big engine = same vehicle
[4:23:48] Aiden: have u heard of the ship of theseus brober
[4:23:52] imdiggingyou: fr fr NODDERS
[4:24:05] Broberown: yes
[4:24:22] Aiden: so take a truck and swap some parts to make it a bus, then i ask you, are they not the same thing brober
[4:24:26] ChillR2: So steering wheel matter, but other parts, don't crystNote
[4:24:27] imdiggingyou: body temperature starts rising
[4:24:35] Broberown: now you're just saying
[4:24:44] Broberown: "take a truck, unbuild the truck and build a bus, now it's a bus"
[4:24:47] Broberown: like, yeah?
[4:24:53] lollygagger808: you could just say it’s from all the fighting
[4:24:55] Broberown: if you build it to be a bus, it'll be a bus
[4:24:56] Aiden: yeah but it was a truck before
[4:25:02] Broberown: ok
[4:25:03] Aiden: so, ship of theseus
[4:25:06] ChillR2: No brober, you can live the steering wheel
[4:25:20] Broberown: get a car, swap some parts in and out to make it a bus, it's a bus
[4:25:22] Aiden: and probably the front wheels ChillR2 but the wheel base needs to be extended
[4:25:32] ChillR2: Fair
[4:25:40] Aiden: @Broberown well the width of a bus and truck are about the same
[4:25:55] Broberown: a car fits in a car lane
[4:25:58] Broberown: a bus fits in a car lane
[4:26:00] Broberown: same same
[4:26:55] Aiden: riddle me this then brober
[4:26:59] Aiden: why do truck companies also produce busses
[4:27:06] Aiden: but not cars
[4:27:07] Broberown: big engines
[4:27:14] Aiden: so theyre basically the same
[4:27:18] Broberown: so we're back to
[4:27:21] Broberown: big engine = same thing

[14:35:14] Rahjoth: Paying Swan out for her part of the house.
[14:35:25] Rahjoth: Y'all had a call about it and he jumped on that quick.
[14:35:29] chaosgeek1: kevin buying Swan out so the house is his alone=divestment in this context
[14:35:57] Rahjoth: I was wondering if y'all had another conversation after that.
[14:36:22] Br1scoCountySr: Didn't y'all get that place like a day ago? Wonder what Swan could've done
[14:36:31] imdiggingyou: what is Marvs last name again? it looked silly
[14:37:10] Rahjoth: If he takes a while and the value of the house goes up, you can always have him pay your percentage of the house at the higher rate. crystSmirk
[14:37:15] MikaelKray: Seems like he misread Swan and jumped the gun trying to make her his crim partner SHRUGGERS
[14:37:33] Br1scoCountySr: Ah. I figured the GPU racks were just a smart way to set up passive income since you can sell coins for good money.
[14:38:09] Rahjoth: Other than the loan for Kev, what is Swan's investment in the house? $45,000?
[14:38:43] imdiggingyou: it was a lot
[14:39:11] Br1scoCountySr: Did Swan buy the computer too?
[14:39:21] miss_daydreamer: a lot of money crystD
[14:39:55] Rahjoth: What is the percentage of the value of the house Swan put in? That's what I was trying to get.

[14:40:45] novidaforme: House was 125k Swan put 80k right?
[14:41:08] Rahjoth: @novidaforme I wanted to know the amount she invested that was not a loan to Kev.

[14:47:56] miss_daydreamer: SHEESH 🗣️🔥💯
[14:48:11] Rahjoth: If Swan invested $45,000 into a $125,000 house, she owns 36% of the house. If the value of the house goes up to $150,000, the value of her investment increases to $54,000, so that is what she would have to be paid out. NODDERS
[14:48:46] Crystalst: Subscribe to my Youtube! New videos on the way! https://youtube.com/crystalst
[14:48:58] imdiggingyou: She invested the most into the house
[14:49:31] Rahjoth: Part of that was supposed to just be a loan for Kev. HOWEVER, if she wants to say that it is part of her investment, which she could try, then yeah, that really changes the numbers.
[14:50:31] Rahjoth: $81,000 out of $125,000 is 64.8%. If the value of the house increased to $150,000, her value would be $97,200.
[14:50:36] Rahjoth: Just as an example.
