[1:46:51] MrSaveAHo: They don't need to know unless you tell em, or someone else in game does.
[1:46:54] jared_____________: They subpoena it in game. The only thing that makes it slightly unrealistic is the lack of smell in game
[1:46:59] ImpendingAgony: I meant the healing items.  Like if someone robs you of them.
[1:47:01] SpilledBagofIce: Yeah... I think it's probably better to keep it on you so there's no sense you're abusing your Dr. position.
[1:47:07] lounettte: ah I see
[1:47:30] zenyatta: yes exactly
[1:47:41] DrPsychonautt: i don't think you're abusing it at all, it's just a perk
[1:48:00] MrSaveAHo: @jared_____________ Explain that? How they secure that subpoena?

[1:53:14] PlatypusLLC: @davidr0x it’s nice
[1:53:23] DrPsychonautt: beef providing the masses with medicinal pot occasionally is like a drop in the bucket compared to how the cops abuse their power
[1:53:23] jared_____________: @MrSaveAHo most of the time they end up dealing with the immediate violent crimes. There aren't any detectives right now (I don't think at least) so doing some sort of rp drug bust is low priority. Plus it needs a judge which is also in short supply
[1:53:34] hrafnagut: @impendingagony i don’t think so
[1:53:34] MrSaveAHo: @DrPsychonautt Cops do it, no matter what.

[2:53:34] dripthecat: True, Esfand has gotten away with a few antics, but even he keeps it minimal.
[2:53:35] TheCowThatSpamsC___Cam: there's rules around it but you can do it if you get permission from admins
[2:53:36] reactionality: beef selling organs om
[2:53:43] KokoLeiiii: in the servers I was in, had to get admin permission to be a corrupt cop
[2:53:47] thomas2hands: @ChadKroegerRS a very fine line of reading the room

[2:54:06] hamter_raptor: qtcBye
[2:54:12] Pahpool: @ChadKroegerRS meta gaming is using out of character knowledge to your benefit, power gaming is minmaxing mechanics of the gain in order only to achieve material or status gain

[2:54:54] thomas2hands: cant wait for raids to start happening tho
[2:54:56] KokoLeiiii: In a server I was in, I organized a prison break event as a corrupt cop and made prisoners fight to the death for gate keys

[3:11:49] TheCowThatSpamsC___Cam: yeah you cant voice id
[3:11:52] dripthecat: Also, the way she is dressed

[3:12:13] Royal_TRC: much funnier if Gup gets framed
[3:12:16] Pee_aRe: is she undercover? i thought she was off duty
[3:12:22] SecretChiley: Bonnie probably would get in trouble if she actually is doing undercover work right now.
[3:12:23] not_the_pasta: Waiting
[3:12:33] ImpendingAgony: @SecretChiley Good point
[3:12:39] jeffrey778: role playing inside of role playing
[3:12:40] dripthecat: Gup getting taken down by an undercover cop is just too perfect.
[3:12:46] thomas2hands: @SecretChiley i mean yeah, any evidence would probably be inadmissable but its still interestin
[3:13:01] SecretChiley: @Pee_aRe Officially, you need permission from higher ups for undercover work. You can't just go undercover whenever you like
[3:13:21] Mancar3: @wakewilder you liking being a real doctor that can definitely read?
[3:13:22] SecretChiley: Also i believe there needs to be a valid reason for it
[3:13:25] Rokuach: Criminals can voice ID, but Beef isn't much of a crim
[3:13:30] dripthecat: I don't know, just guessing based on the RP I'm seeing from your perspective
[3:13:38] Pee_aRe: @SecretChiley ah ok
[3:13:40] thomas2hands: real actual doctor dr beef
[3:13:48] dripthecat: Also, it isn't like Gup hides what he is doing at all
[3:13:55] DrPsychonautt: waittt i was watching cornwood and i don't think they're allowed to do undercover or am i wrong?? i swearrr i heard that
[3:13:59] Vizzeek: being a doctor you just naturally interact with everyone too
[3:14:02] thomas2hands: can beef even read his own name
[3:14:26] Kkkkkole: @dripthecat would be fun to see jail arc for Gary
[3:14:32] SecretChiley: Also what bonnie is doing i think would be entrapment since she is asking for weed
[3:14:40] lounettte: no you said you wouldn’t need it KEKW
[3:14:41] thomas2hands: @DrPsychonautt you need permission from up high to do actual undercover work. anything else would be a violation. which is fun
[3:14:45] BlankPanda_: you should have his number
[3:14:48] thomas2hands: @SecretChiley yeah this
[3:14:49] Weapun_X: you have lenny's?
[3:14:57] thomas2hands: entrapment is also fun
[3:15:04] DrPsychonautt: @DrPsychonautt ahh ok makes sense
[3:15:23] i_dont_pay_my_taxes_: you a real doctor now?
[3:15:28] lounettte: you were annoyed at him after the talk in the garage and him begging for your number
[3:15:32] ImpendingAgony: As beef you would probabaly  voice concern over a shitfy character to gup.  Think along the lines of if it was a different voice. Would beef say something then?
[3:15:33] dripthecat: In RP I think you told him you wouldn't need it and it didn't come up again
[3:15:42] thomas2hands: i do feel like beefers would know a narc tho
