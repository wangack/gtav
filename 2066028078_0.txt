[5:37:29] tigerpapa9: Jordan is really good at making others take it physical 1st.
[5:37:30] JPRoads: Murder? Or pay the $75 drop fee? Tough call.

[5:39:40] Gadn: its funny how when cops talk to eachother its normalized to sum up all the towing as Jordan Steele
[5:39:55] Vale_DC: @SirSaltyBacon especially when they do something like park on a goddamn sidewalk like it's the most normal thing ever
[5:39:58] Sylasha: He doesnt really break laws. He knows all the stupid work arounds to avoid most crimes. Everyone once in a while, he goes crazy tho
