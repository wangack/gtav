[4:30:47] DanOMyte79: i didnt think Tessa was going to show up
[4:31:00] c0pp3rm00n: super fast tug boat that siz can use the flee the city LUL
[4:31:09] MacabreOS: maybe when isaac  went away, he went to find professor mcgonagall, to lean Transfiguration lol
[4:31:11] SleepingSmurf: Andi trying to give crumbs but I think was mainly ignored
[4:31:16] Madam_Orange: i thought more of the cops would talk but they didn't
[4:31:19] CautiousDani: NODDERS it was better for roleplay 100%
[4:31:21] Jerco2020: with his unlimited funds @c0pp3rm00n
[4:31:32] Tyler4AM: It can also be hard to hold your tongue when people are speculating on info that you know IC to be false
[4:31:42] MYounk: I think overall it was still a success
[4:31:58] kaizynh: And to think, this is only one horsemen. imagine what the other 3 would do. 🤔
[4:32:05] Tyler4AM: I wouldn't call Dark dying a success KEKW
[4:32:10] esrou: It is expanding the circle as well and letting others know in a way who is involved
[4:32:17] Lerpukka: Dark might not think it as a success but otherwise it was a pretty cool thing kivaSip
[4:32:19] discardedDigit: It went about as well as I expected it to. There was never going to be a solution here.
[4:32:44] thespian234: Is there a reason why Andi didn't mention that Norman would offer out of a deal if he can't hold up his end?
[4:32:45] opalducky: Bonecon 2023 is gonna be sick kivaCool
[4:32:55] uitzui: i think BoneCon hurt those who actually need help because they most likely will spin more theories that lead to nothing now
[4:33:04] willowfennec: on this server torture
[4:33:07] CautiousDani: They would’ve had a bad night lol
[4:33:07] rainblue600: insta stab
[4:33:09] yungVDD: he should have revealed who did then teleported them to purgatory or something
[4:33:17] c0pp3rm00n: baas level lengths
[4:33:26] Tyler4AM: "I am in fact capable of lying"
[4:33:28] littleelfwanders: @thespian234 probably because a lot of the deals they made involve killing, hers didn't
[4:33:34] Zuzurafa22: but Norman has never lied D: lol
[4:33:35] Silvertooth09: depends a lot on who that person is as well
[4:33:41] TastyKudzu: I think it's a mistake to assume that everyone there was anti-Norman. Surely he has allies.
[4:33:42] Lerpukka: one person has the information and their solution would be to kill that person, that checks out KEKW
[4:34:24] SnowBouLe: Normie a homie
[4:34:34] tyrrous47: Andi wants the chicken man gone
[4:34:51] Jerco2020: Norman for hoa tomatoCult
[4:35:16] Tyler4AM: He would've been a beast in that war
[4:35:38] DJ_4point0: HOD for Death
[4:35:43] CautiousDani: Left andi on read for that text LUL
[4:35:45] Tyler4AM: Imagine trying to get Norman to run sani
[4:35:55] RushiFeru: LUL Kind of funny that the people in the meeting that know the most also don't want to get rid of norman
[4:35:55] Nightbot: kivaLUL
[4:36:07] Dark_Traveller: Does Andi have any thoughts about Isaac?
[4:36:09] Jerco2020: Norman we have to get maaats for max comeonnn
[4:36:14] littleelfwanders: "Norman, let's do Dodo
[4:36:23] Tyler4AM: Uhhh Norman, was that your complaint in the complaint jar kivaM
[4:36:25] SnowBouLe: Norman gotta mack for Siz too
[4:36:26] kaizynh: As long as you don't pull him out of the car, it's fine. he seems ok with driving
[4:36:28] Lerpukka: Chopping cars NOPERS Chopping people NODDERS
[4:36:33] enonellaf: so when is darks i got boned at bone con shirt coming in lol
[4:36:36] ShinsetsuTenshi: Norman and the worst generation in a car together kivaLUL
[4:36:43] mighty_malteser: Erp with norman at dododate
[4:37:24] Silvertooth09: is someone humming in the background??
[4:37:27] dirtyppdave: outta nowhere but i listened to your lighthouse song its still a banger, id love to see andi do another lil concert for people again andi's audience really seemed to like it too
[4:37:52] BlackJack19042: might be talkin about the background music too
[4:38:03] CautiousDani: Everyone’s costumes were great PrideFlower
[4:38:03] TheElm: Kivas humming is like a sirens call
[4:38:15] littleelfwanders: I don't ever want Norman to meet Stanley omg
[4:38:35] Chocoletbunny: Did they say what was happening to Dark?
[4:38:39] Silvertooth09: de bgm is what I think I am talking about
[4:38:58] kaylacurtis01: I love how after Dark went down someone questioned what happened like lol what do you think
[4:39:02] CautiousDani: I didn’t get bingo but I filled a lot of squares
[4:39:07] uitzui: ^
[4:39:30] Dark_Traveller: my bingo card was a lot of sbs
[4:40:23] inus2: I can't believe Dark got ded'd and not Flop also tbh
[4:40:57] Pwn_Tra1n: it does make a threat to flop tho
[4:41:01] littleelfwanders: @inus2 and Dark was the one who declared he was going to say no and run
[4:41:03] uitzui: what did surprise me was that Isaac was pretty much his opener to the con kivaLUL
[4:41:06] BlackJack19042: Dark also straight up said he wasn't gonna follow through on his deal and literally run from Norman, so ye LUL
[4:41:20] Chocoletbunny: Ya think anyone will pursue Issac to understand him more?
[4:41:29] kaylacurtis01: Oh yeah Isaac is probably not the play here
[4:41:32] Tyler4AM: Yeah BoneCon pretty much opened up with "Alright so this fuckin guy's got a brother"
[4:41:54] Zuzurafa22: So you're saying Flop will probably go after him lol
[4:41:56] Lerpukka: Did Flop suggest to kill Isaac again? KEKW
[4:41:58] Arttumiro: It took literally 4 minutes
[4:42:01] yungVDD: I feel like opening with Isaac basically sealed the deal on what would happen, not to mention saying he wasnt going to do the deal
[4:42:04] Arttumiro: for Isaacs name to get mentioned
[4:42:06] RushiFeru: well but if Dark survives he can proudly wear that bonecon Shirt LUL atleast for the 2 days he got left LUL
[4:42:23] uitzui: i think the only circumstance meeting Isaac could be okay for Andi is if Norman has her deliver poison to him
[4:42:36] littleelfwanders: I have no idea who Isaac is but with the way folk are like 'don't mention him' that says enought to me tbh
[4:42:44] Anrisacia: Just noped right out KEKW
[4:42:47] CautiousDani: Glad Norman showed up for the panel tho

[4:43:42] Lerpukka: this city needs better big boats
[4:44:31] Zietha: kinamaPog
[4:44:32] LittleB1RDY: monkaW what the heck is that
[4:44:33] littleelfwanders: @kaylacurtis01 or just make smarter deals that you know you can follow through on
[4:44:42] SacarioE: uhh
[4:44:45] Zuzurafa22: I think Bonecon at least pointed out the different people involved. The desperate for answers, the inquisitive & the accepting
[4:44:48] CautiousDani: Uhhhh KEKW
[4:44:57] AdamElJefe: wtf
[4:44:57] Madam_Orange: is that ?

[4:48:06] KyleAOR: KEKW
[4:48:37] AshuraX13: Yep, narrowed down to a handful of people now
[4:48:49] Lerpukka: BoneCon was all Andi's idea and a plan to kill Richard Dark NODDERS
[4:48:58] discardedDigit: The guy running for Chief of Police who sacrificed his own sanity.
