[1:19:16] DevilDogTash: why doesn‚Äôt the 15% go into the PD budget instead of personal banks?
[1:19:16] RicoLoco52: @Janman88 I don't think it was ever obvious to the pd as a whole that the state refused to pay anything but salaries

[1:19:20] General_Kumtash: @EsfandTV   If they want all departments etc to be self-sustraining.. why does 85% of the charges go to the state? you're paying for someone elses department there? 20% should go to whoever is charging, 80% to the PD funds for repairs and everything else.
[1:19:20] RexPappa: Just stream more Clueless
[1:19:22] stratiz_: Check your messages
[1:19:26] Shakeboxing: @EsfandTV - But the amount of money coming from citations/fines maybe a % of it... Should go into the motor pool to help offset costs  for repairs and pay. Then it's self-sustained.... This will put more of a morale into the PD on getting out there doing their job.
[1:19:29] ColbaeTV: @TheGodmother i think april iirc
[1:19:30] EPiQ: Crim and civs are also paying 100% out of their own earnings
[1:19:32] Welshstig: it takes time to balance crims impact, in the long term it could be a good idea
[1:19:32] Thomefan251: if they thought people didnt wanan work because of daps...this is gonan be so much worse lol
[1:19:34] harperakami: but its like that for ooc issues, so it doesn't matter
[1:19:34] nathund: playing to lose will never be a good feeling in any game ever.
[1:19:35] PsychoJoker: As i Said All the PD Officers all jumped the gun and bought houses when they should have bought personal vehicles and maintained them its a fact. As soon as the houses got released everyone rushed to buy one it was a dumb choice IMO
[1:19:35] Techno_Plumber: there shouldn‚Äôt be any shared vehicles.

[1:19:39] RenegadeGWP: If PD stopped more crime the economy will balance out more

[1:19:46] harperakami: the pd doesn't have a budget because of literal dev problems lol
[1:19:46] sauslol: Almost all members of PD lied about how much money they had in the account yesterday. They have money.
[1:19:48] ColbaeTV: mhm

[1:19:53] SchizoForever: monkaW
[1:19:53] SarahFlare: PD morale is dogshit already and then last night finding out no budget at all and then needing to pay back a loan.
[1:19:53] LoudPackNoReefa: the PD getting a portion of fines from money made my criminals is still self sufficiency
[1:19:54] ZachFromChat: shouldn't the "tickets" immediately go to the budget?
[1:19:56] nathund: so buff pd pay
[1:19:56] Utschig: Aware Stacking incoming
[1:19:56] Shaphilly_: if pd needs to be self sufficient, what is 85% of it going to state instead of back into a pd account?
[1:19:57] Klausnomi72: cotton eye joe
[1:19:59] StormiNyan: pd funded by its own occifers Aware
[1:20:00] ncs_310: yeah but‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a video game
[1:20:00] Weaug: MMOs need money sinks
[1:20:01] Khaosshinobi: self sufficiency is very good for pd because it keeps them to be able to do their job regardless of the server economy, so if crims can just negatively impact pd then they just win more and more
[1:20:01] MDeRick: Also all of the money that PD makes comes from the state funds which is the 85% partially
[1:20:02] Miterex: They just cant allow the economy to snowball, its a money sink
[1:20:02] ebos22: 1 time infusion of 5 mill to PDand then do that 15% thing
[1:20:04] DonSequitur: if you pump money there will be killer inflation
[1:20:04] stachesquanch: seems to me a small amount of the charges going to the PD would solve this
[1:20:04] Shakeboxing: @EsfandTV - But the amount of money coming from citations/fines maybe a % of it... Should go into the motor pool to help offset costs for repairs and pay. Then it's self-sustained.... This will put more of a morale into the PD on getting out there doing their job.

[1:20:14] Janman88: the 15 % is fine i guess but the approach of a self sufficient PD is dangerous
[1:20:15] ThePointGaming: Needs to have some sort of work week, so people cant endlessly grind jobs
[1:20:15] dudemanbroo: please for the love of god drink water
[1:20:16] APeculiarHabit: MMO devs literally hire economics majors to handle this stuff
[1:20:16] PsychoJoker: I want a house but i dont wanna buy a car or maintain the ones we have BabyRage
[1:20:16] DevilDogTash: but they get a daily rate don‚Äôt they without the 15%?

[1:20:23] SecretChiley: @ncs_310 Yes, but also they dont want to ruin the server by inflating the economy.
[1:20:30] SylvarantHP: What no $25 Nopixel token yet? @EsfandTV
[1:20:30] nathund: people are just endlessly stacking money
[1:20:34] DrWetbone: commission incentivizes pushing high yield fines and stacking charges

[1:20:35] Gozs: HDMI
[1:20:35] Coldthree226: are you still ppo?
[1:20:36] PierogiWasTaken: so how does server economy work?
[1:20:37] Tarchomper: crims should be charged for vehicle repairs so the PD can then take up that charge
[1:20:37] xGotNoClout: The PD honestly get paid enough to deal with repairs
[1:20:39] OutKast2: HDMI
[1:20:39] Gachiguru: Basically the cops can only get funding if the server does crime LULE

[1:20:41] realpossible: @deadcIutch it isnt his choice what happens to the budget, regardless the city wont always be in the green
[1:20:42] Makemepurr: In no way Policeman have to pay for goverment equipment or cars
[1:20:44] jeremyks9: state is paying salaries already most of the cops he asked had 20K plus dollars
[1:20:48] DevilDogTash: but they get a daily rate don‚Äôt they without the 15%? or no
[1:20:49] Shakeboxing: @EsfandTV - But the amount of money coming from citations/fines maybe a % of it... Should go into the motor pool to help offset costs for repairs and pay. Then it's self-sustained.... This will put more of a morale into the PD on getting out there doing their job.
[1:20:51] phswimmer: The hourly PD rate comes out of thin air, without some sort of sink the money ends up devalued
[1:20:52] ColbaeTV: just buy a 20m shark card xdd
[1:20:52] Techno_Plumber: no shared vehicles. everyone takes care of themselves and the new ppl ride along with the old till they save up to buy a car. problem solved
[1:20:53] Wallsh_: @esfandtv but the charges after 15% all goes to the state and none to PD
[1:20:54] LosOrtiz: Hello Esfand & chat.
[1:20:55] Daxius121: @deadciutch max is the mayor not the treasurer.
[1:20:55] warkid123: @Shakeboxing that is pretty much the same as giving them a monthly budget, no different as the money isnt going into a money pit (it goes into the money circulation either way)
[1:20:57] HowieWoweee: sounds like it will just make officers push more charges and make it terrible for criminals
[1:20:58] jburke23: I just feel like a 15-20% cut off charges aside from personal percentage would make a big difference and not have a huge impact economically
[1:20:58] Kaisenjin: @xGotNoClout It don't bro

[1:21:02] Janman88: thats the same idea as any country or nation needs "earn" money @EsfandTV this goes deep into macro economics
[1:21:02] Republic_of_texas: there's too much money in the system from the crims jobs so all the prices are inflated and no budgets can be implemented

[1:28:09] Seetherrr: @mercs99 yeah you are right, that should have been communicated to the councill/PD leadership via OOC channels earlier I think.  If all cops were putting in some money from their checks from the beginning I feel like PD would be in a fine financial place.  Although I liked Jenny's suggestion of the BD budget getting a share of the fines that were going purely to the state.

[1:29:15] God_is_a_cat_girl: yeah, if there's nothing going on why can't they just do something else? Just make it so they aren't on duty but can still be called to go on duty when needed
[1:29:16] Numtjok: Make it so you dont get lawyer pay if you're on another job.
[1:29:21] thebogeym4n: Don't forget about the report

[1:29:37] MrKaiax: time for a lawyer character
[1:29:38] Navigator_Nav: @EsfandTV  I have a sneaking suspicion that the state account is meant as a money sink/burn and that it was never meant to be accessible.  Hence cranes statement that accounts weren't working as intended yet
[1:29:38] fixer_18: Money isn't even the big issue. It's boredom lol
[1:29:39] RicoLoco52: if the state wants this place to be completely self sufficient, why should you be sending them a majority of any money from fines?
[1:29:39] sladjan__: V

[1:29:42] spazticbull: I'm gonna go arrest people, then immediately says he is going to go hangout at the courthouse
[1:29:44] slomojosh: @esfandtv you had an investigative motive to fulfill their down time. they need to figure the same
[1:29:44] NilfgaardianSlave: With cops they only aren't allowed to if they are using cop prio. Kiwo has god prio so she doesn't need to follow that rule
[1:29:45] jacksmithcje: i think the more realistic strict budget is backfiring imo
[1:29:45] PrettyKrazy: ohhh...

[1:29:47] Stomachfakie: ret prio?

[1:29:49] Zendorea: Lawyers need a invoicing system for charging fees
[1:29:49] allenog03: that makes sm sense
[1:29:50] bromonga: I think it should, the dude just said they dont have much to do so there will be no payment
[1:29:50] jordeon123: Kiwo already has prio?
[1:29:52] sauslol: If they join the queue as a lawyer, doctor, ems or police. They cant do any other job. Since those queues have prio.
[1:29:56] captain_steve_420: its ironic how all the cops who accused cornwood of dooming are now dooming themselves
[1:29:58] Numtjok: That makes sense
[1:29:58] Techno_Plumber: esfandPrio
[1:30:02] thebogeym4n: @EsfandTV don't forget about the report
[1:30:02] Lupusdeus: Maisy doesn't do that TBF, she's not signed in as a cop when she tows. Lawyers have to be signed in to be paid so they can't do anything else., which is dumb.
[1:30:02] allenog03: literally the rp, so true and makes it so good
[1:30:03] Frankendoink: @EsfandTV, did you end up watching the Ruby clip last night?
[1:30:05] danmago89: Chat, help him write the report pls. Postponing it gives me anxiety

[1:30:19] cosoquello: @Frankendoink what clip?
[1:30:20] allenog03: the amount you spend that you make back in to rp is what keeps cornwood so great & entertaining
[1:30:20] KurenYo: normal jobs pay to well and crimes are time sensitive
[1:30:20] Felrane: you are not buying houses/cars/funding other projects ect.. ITs all going back into the PD
[1:30:21] Xethra: Kiwo isn't a fair example, not all cops can do that
[1:30:22] DaeTonator: Cornwood pool's money to loan it out
[1:30:23] forgotheals: until you sign out of lawyert
[1:30:24] Pibon1: Just dont have prio 4Head
[1:30:24] Sabretooth91: @EsfandTV Is Cornwood collecting all the lawns he gave? LUL

[1:38:35] WalshyDev: yeah cheever is a great rper
[1:38:36] Welshstig: she‚Äôs so dedicated to the role
[1:38:36] dotslashdata: her reading the salute report she was dying laughing
[1:38:36] rhaziaa: This is where meta hopping helps, because you can hear the streamer behind the character
[1:38:37] CrystalDimension: @EsfandTV THIS https://clips.twitch.tv/OnerousConsiderateGalagoOSfrog-1EewcfgscYhu_uWm
[1:38:37] StormiNyan: esfandL ruth is just a character. not cheever
[1:38:37] FelipeLLs: esfandL
[1:38:37] nathund: there were so manyy times she wanted to laugh at cornwood shit
[1:38:39] Xen_Crypt: She made an amazing arc for all of PD

[1:38:42] Hawaiianbreado: yeh shes much diff compared to ruth lol
[1:38:42] CMDR: I used to watch cheever a bit during her wildrp streams
[1:38:43] CuteWorld: there's just no point to being mean like that
[1:38:43] DatDudeJakeC: She put in her discord that it was a medical emergency out of state with her father @EsfandTV
[1:38:44] RietArtwork: that's why we are able to hate the character haha
[1:38:44] jackxanxcoke: i like her <3
[1:38:45] jessielight: she is an excellent rper for sure
[1:38:46] cade227123: people take talking about a character as chat talking shit on the streamer. they‚Äôre just as weird as the people who shit on streamers for RP
[1:38:48] jacksmithcje: shes did a last solid though quitting in character bcos beric is pushing charges as it fits her well with the murder charges on cornwood damm shes good
[1:38:49] LogicWeasel: FeelsStrongMan  we gonna miss that rp'er.  hope things get better for her family
[1:38:50] Navigator_Nav: Her reaction to your report on the bush shooting is something everyone needs to see @EsfandTV
[1:38:50] thelosttwo: she was laughing so much when you did the sma baas
[1:38:50] itsNudeGrandpa: It's the same as when audiences struggle to separate the actor from the character. Cheever's getting the Joffrey treatment
[1:38:50] cyberwave1984: Saaab screaming cornwood was funny
[1:38:51] maikkekku: too much power IC but no counter balance YEP
[1:38:52] deafguy87: YEP Û†ÄÄ
[1:38:52] squirtlehermit: sometimes her ooc comments on moments was really funny
[1:38:53] FelipeLLs: esfandO ü©¥ hear that chat esfand is always watching esfandO ü©¥
[1:38:54] Serrik: its always hard to play the heel but someone has to do it so the story is interesting
[1:38:54] ThePointGaming: if Turner would have been around more too
[1:38:55] RicoLoco52: i just hardly ever saw here given my work schedule
[1:38:55] Pravolution: It messed things up but it created so much great contnt
[1:38:55] DannyL3tscher: yeah she's even said that ruth is a bitch, that's the character
[1:38:55] Kalious78: @esfandtv al you have to do is play/watch that clip of her finding out about the +1 for sam bass to see the difference
[1:38:55] CrystalDimension: @EsfandTV THIS IS WHY SHE'S COOL https://clips.twitch.tv/OnerousConsiderateGalagoOSfrog-1EewcfgscYhu_uWm
[1:38:56] FelipeLLs: esfandO ü©¥ hear that chat esfand is always watching esfandO ü©¥
[1:38:56] Kelborn: Same with SSaab when he had to fire denzel, you could hear how upset he was OOC in his voice @EsfandTV
[1:38:56] YoshiTheDeeno: @EsfandTV she said your report on donald bush was really fun but ruth wouldnt like it
[1:38:56] TheGodmother: @bleu_starrr Sadge
[1:38:56] FinalEffect: people cant separate the person from the character.
[1:38:57] dioholic: she does now tho
[1:38:57] SpiritEX: just the character is most hate-able char in the city
[1:38:58] TheLadyCupcake: @EsfandTV become sheriff and make her undersheriff GIGACHAD
[1:38:59] Edward_Theodore: the thing is we hate ruth not cheever
[1:38:59] w111iam1: Cheever is so fucking good at rp hope she comes back

[1:39:01] MrRhythmless: True
[1:39:01] Pibon1: Absence of Turner kinda messed all up, Slacks cant deal with Ruth alone
[1:39:02] Evilzanz: i think ppl dident like the ruth char
[1:39:02] DaltonIRL: She was the Joffrey from game of thrones, the hatred Ruth gets  just shows how good Cheevers is at RP
[1:39:02] jokerm21: I enjoy watching Cheever‚Äôs stream because the distinction between the streamer and character really helped me understand RP
[1:39:03] ColbaeTV: HEARTS IN CHAT FOR CHEEVER <3
[1:39:04] laaazylemon: she almost die laughing about the Sam Bass thing, but then said "Ruth is not gonna like this" LUL
[1:39:04] kahlilgo: she woulda flipped
[1:39:04] phswimmer: It was a good character 4 months in, not while things were being built

[1:39:11] funeralfortheliving: like ruth with beric as the boss would be awesome
[1:39:12] Pee_aRe: but Ruth doesnt want to have a boss
[1:39:12] DisposableHero: So whose gonna be the next scapegoat
[1:39:13] PrettyKrazy: alot of new rp viewers, like myself, might have trouble adapting with hatable characters so it can get out of hand easily
[1:39:13] sevens777s: @EsfandTV are you happy with the new chief of police?
[1:39:14] Lala61991: Ruth would be fine as a patrol officer
[1:39:14] Mezagon: i agree, but the fact that people try to ignore the inevitability in this day and age is strange to me. i still cry at the idea of losing my folks but theyre fine still and i know ill still be sad when theyre gone
[1:39:14] FizzDidThis: WICKED bike patrol
[1:39:15] justgothere_andimstoned: hoppers used to be pure vitriol
[1:39:15] jacksmithcje: she did a last solid though quitting in character bcos beric is pushing charges as it fits her well with the murder charges on cornwood damm shes good
[1:39:18] deafguy87: theres always a spot for the straight man in RP but when uncheck its crazy
[1:39:18] Pibon1: Yeah I know
[1:39:19] SurelyBaked: Ruth‚Äôs character is the perfect balance for cornwood
[1:39:20] ZuldeadTV: yeah Sadge
[1:39:21] MysticCasey: @esfandtv If she already had checks in place from higher command Ruth would've been an amazing long-term character
[1:39:21] Drackaine: she created a lot of drama ok, but trying to push the "you do RP the way I want" doesnt fit in nopixel
[1:39:23] Qolat: I think she made a great mid season antagonist.
[1:39:24] the_schlan: The few times i've caught her streams, its hilarious.  She cracks up laughing, "i love this, but ruth is going to hate this."  rp chatters dont know a difference
[1:39:25] LogicWeasel: Sadge  so shitty
[1:39:25] Mezagon: we should prepare ourselves for that day coming
[1:39:25] yourdadow: wait chat whats the verdict on ruth?
[1:39:26] Freddiepines: GETALIFE PIT THE LAUNDROMAT
[1:39:27] TheRoseForce: How do you think it will affect the logistics in Shift 1 with the people part/all the way through recruitment?
[1:39:28] PrettyKrazy: YEP
[1:39:29] Pee_aRe: The Bike Patrol is the new meta
[1:39:29] theblackdog808: yup
[1:39:30] Hawaiianbreado: so slacks is the only captain right now?
[1:39:30] ShrewOfNietzsche: I‚Äôve caught her giggling at Denzel irl.
[1:39:30] Braintew: @EsfandTV Ruth created so much more interesting conflict RP in the city it almost put most of the crims in the city to shame.
[1:39:31] usernamethatistosapproved: bike patrol on the way WICKED
[1:39:31] TheGodmother: yeah Sadge
[1:39:31] forgotheals: Do we know if Beric got Cheif of Police or not yet?
[1:39:32] aspectofdaze: CAPTAINS CURSE monkaW
[1:39:32] thezentris: @EsfandTV Cheever's even said before about Cornwoods actions "thats so funny BUT ruth is gonna hate that" and people still think it's the streamers personality. shits insane
[1:39:33] kaltzan: Who is on bike patrol
[1:39:33] tpainbuyindranks: it takes priority
[1:39:33] PLK_: YEP
[1:39:33] LazyMike: bike chase
[1:39:34] dapyman: @esfandtv Did you food arrive yet??
[1:39:35] jacksmithcje: shes did a solid though quitting in character bcos beric is pushing charges as it fits her well with the murder charges on cornwood damm shes good
[1:39:35] Agentdolly: Ssaab Aware
[1:39:36] Republic_of_texas: I watched one of her previous broadcasts and there's no way she would have done that, it was totally opposite. She expressed that she felt everyone was slacking at work for streaming content instead of being serious about her vision of the PD, then you come along proposing breaking that up.
[1:39:36] magicite852: She's playing the strict and stern character. People are going to hate her by that character design. She played that soo well despite getting hate. Takes a good rper to take that on the chin and stick to your character and not change.
[1:39:38] squirtlehermit: yeah turner was one of my favorite characters at the beginning of 4.0
[1:39:39] JoshTheCarrot: RIPBOZO
[1:39:39] LogicWeasel: this gonna be the most down-bad PD response to Laundry LUL
[1:39:40] Mickow94: Doesnt Ruth have a newborn baby too etc?
[1:39:41] Pibon1: Just saying its all really unlucky, in terms of their situation and also RP
[1:39:41] MrFuniBones: Well hopefully she comes back after suspension now that there's Beric as CoP. I think Ruth will be a great character under the CoP now @EsfandTV
[1:39:42] Janman88: for real: the shit they tried to lift with only 3 people was not possible @EsfandTV it sucks but it is what it is
[1:39:43] allenog03: <3 as i get older i relate to them, its so, so heartbreaking mentally enduring
[1:39:43] Rock4holic: @EsfandTV It should be common sense to differentiate the streamer from the character. I can hate the character, but the streamer did a good job to make me feel like that about his character.
[1:39:44] TheGodmother: @thezentris YEP
[1:39:47] Icestruggler: ofc nothing into laundromat + vault robbery at the same time
[1:39:48] mercs99: she sticks to her character, which i wish way more people did. not enough people give their characters serious flaws or drawbacks and stick to them. part of why i love watching moon rp, he makes character sheets with flaws that he commits to even if it can fuck him up.
[1:39:48] yourdadow: @forgotheals he did
[1:39:49] Diamondman121314: You definitely can't keep up in a CVPI Aware
[1:39:49] 1manpizza: Aloo we need a bike cop for this pursuit
[1:39:51] such_tunz: @EsfandTV I lost both of my parents when i was 9 years old. It sucked i wish that on no one. No matter who they are or what they have done to me.
[1:39:51] Gachiguru: This all could have been avoided if there was a healthy chain of command to deal with having to take time off
[1:39:51] inducedcatharsis: ON A BIKE OMEGALAUGHING
[1:39:52] LogicWeasel: a Bike chase
[1:39:53] GoldBoxPlz: 911 robbery at vault
[1:39:53] PrettyKrazy: omE bike pd
[1:39:54] antreids: I think everyone wants to see a villain but can't understand when there is one who is a character out of crime. They immediately attack the streamer
[1:39:55] Architank: Ruth would have been great as a "transfer captain" later in the season. She was not a good start
[1:39:56] Xav__: Alot of speculation happenin

[1:40:07] jacksmithcje: shes did a solid quitting in character bcos beric is pushing charges as it fits her well with the murder charges on cornwood damm shes good

[1:40:17] laaazylemon: open the door
[1:40:18] misfit667: Tuner was big mad after the chief announcement
[1:40:20] peepoShortOnAGooser: i don't think it takes a particularly good RPer to play a character like Ruth. It's all one-sided, no real interaction

[2:52:14] doriansdonuts: @doin_it_sweet I mean ooc issues she resigned because of a family emergency.
[2:52:14] taraannee: no ones cheering abt ooc shit chat, if all we hear/know is she quit IN RP then we're happy THE CHARACTER quit. ofc all love to cheevers hope things are ok <3
[2:52:16] GremLynneXO: In RP sense it is absolutely healthy that she won't be back. Obviously OOC we all feel bad for her.
[2:52:17] dapyman: @quaylewastaken Ruth not Ruby
[2:52:19] Lupusdeus: This really isn't about Cornwood LUL

[2:52:30] doriansdonuts: @taraannee Sadly the weirdos don't see that
[2:52:31] dalton_dcxx: you say that daily
[2:52:36] itsrambo: Ruth saw she would finally have someone above her so quit

[2:52:37] brandontko: thank god ruth is gone bye bye
[2:52:39] Klebenopper: @ElizabethAtDawn thank yqa
[2:52:42] justgothere_andimstoned: @thebigshabam in the end everyone just wants to have fun, but its hard to balance between crim and police

[2:53:13] smith2244b: LMAOOOOOOOOOO
[2:53:15] Stagnation: @ManakinEU this part is just... not that entertaining though. the deliberations, the 2+ hours of trying to piece a scene together by text, instead of having disagreements over what's on footage? nah.
[2:53:17] jadetortoise: PD just needs more bodies, and a consistent command presence at all times. Whether it be CoP, ass Cop, captains, or a sargent
[2:53:17] taraannee: @doriansdonuts ya "dOnT bE wEiRd cHaT iTs SaD" like no sick fuck is happy abt ooc shit, i didnt know abt the ooc shit or that she quit in rp lmao
[2:53:17] zeldaspirit: Ask him to not give up. Ask him not to quit
[2:53:19] thebigshabam: @justgothere_andimstoned crims are wayyy ahead as far as game progression but PD is where the RP is at
[2:53:21] jacksmithcje: @itsrambo wrong take but in character she did atleast play to that but no still really
[2:53:23] cyberwave1984: Carbine was an officer but shit one

[2:54:46] justgothere_andimstoned: @thebigshabam true, ive been hopping between crim streams and its all grinding towards more guns and better crimes. Apparantly its all working towards automatic weapons and 3.0 style heists
[2:54:47] Stagnation: @300ducks content is what matters, what are you talking about? and RPers love watching clips. hard disagree.

[2:55:16] 300ducks: @Stagnation its a "content server" but the people are playing on it to roleplay, doing PD work is part of PD roleplay
[2:55:19] Payasadas: @moodymellow haven't seen him that much he seems pretty sharp and observant, picks up on details that other cops miss
[2:55:20] PacGamer: I feel like you need to be a degen (respectfully) to play on this server. Like you have to live on the server.

[2:55:42] MysticCasey: Max's comparison to G6 drivers funding their own work makes sense.

[2:56:06] Stagnation: @ManakinEU random errors (as in, cops turning off body cameras) can be a thing when they're trying to get away with something.
[2:56:11] MysticCasey: But the earning diffierence between G6 and PD is huge.
[2:56:12] KenKardashian: SHITSHOW
[2:56:15] RobotsAndMaltLiquor: @MysticCasey Not really, one directly drives more income, the other doesn't.
[2:56:19] moodymellow: @Payasadas that's awesome, we need a outside look into things for sure
[2:56:19] naughtyones: So the best way to Police is clock in.. do nothing so you do not rack up repairs or collect daps
[2:56:23] CyboargTV: I think it's good the cops pay their way. It's gonna bring sort of progression for the PD players
[2:56:24] blahder: I think FTO training should be more of a mentorship, where a cadet follows one specific f
[2:56:26] Stagnation: @300ducks PDs IRL use body cams, still not agreeing here
[2:56:31] Tortoise88: MysticCasey until you take into account that a law abiding G6 driver would never have to get their rig repaired half as much as a PD vehicle.
[2:56:35] cuspeli: @PacGamer for leadership/important roles ye, as independent contribuitors though (part-time burger shot workers, g6 runners, mechanincs, not so much)
[2:56:39] 300ducks: @Stagnation ok agree to disagree
[2:56:39] allenog03: yea

[2:57:20] MysticCasey: @Tortoise88 That could be solved with a PD mechanic if the state allowed it. Then the repair cost would be directly going into buying their own parts.

[2:57:22] fabby83: cosmetic PD FeelsBadMan
[2:57:23] Republic_of_texas: to get a budget, govt has to limit the crime opportunities and regulate them somehom. devs aren't going to pour more money into existing services

[3:27:43] tehshoe: @Recon_XoX its a scout so its not a normal vehicle, they all need command approval
[3:27:44] OutKast2: she beast ReallyMad
[3:27:45] wiltsne: he did tho ?
[3:27:45] b2a80: not a judge
[3:27:46] alienb__: did cornwood get a dap?

[3:27:49] SchizoForever: it's a big boy
[3:27:50] TheSoldier1851: Siobhan was probably with Max LUL
[3:27:50] chopsuey84: @EsfandTV what happeded?
[3:27:50] Zanduin: He came to you
[3:27:50] Wetidiot: @hevestarvey420 he needs permission because its a higher class vehicle

[3:27:59] FelipeLLs: VeryEs
[3:28:00] cuspeli: i love the way lenny says siobahn's name
[3:28:00] quaylewastaken: that went to her husbon
[3:28:01] Toastedgamer03: @blahder he went to cornwood first then shiobhan but you know going to shiobhan is basically going to max at this point since chief of staff is made to further the mayor's plans
[3:28:01] FelipeLLs: VeryEs
[3:28:01] imSteffin: why would you want to eat water burgers thats gross
[3:28:02] SchizoForever: VeryEs

[3:28:05] finalfork: @the_main_burt yeah i guess the special ones. seems slightly silly since they bought them but
[3:28:07] TheSoldier1851: so maybe he went to Siobhan, but people probably wanna pin it on going to Max
[3:28:07] ViceroyStark: Esfand ‚ù§Ô∏è glad you sticking to RP for so long
[3:28:07] FelipeLLs: VeryEs mmmmmm
[3:28:07] ZuldeadTV: mhm

[3:28:22] Zanduin: you were definitely first
[3:28:24] GLSMarbles: Yes
[3:28:24] Dash_O_Pepper: Duncaning Just 2 minutes, Captain
[3:28:25] imSteffin: @Shammyjeff, balance right now
[3:28:29] w111iam1: @colbaetv nah can‚Äôt you add a second pin? don‚Äôt know how it works honestly
[3:28:29] Crowzone80: if he feels he is being asked to participate in a crime, privledge ends
[3:28:30] tbdm55: @Shammyjeff no money
[3:28:31] genesissukehiro: @EsfandTV  you were first and she is his wife so it looks bad
[3:28:33] Basard21: i think he talked to you first but he was already going to go to siobahn or malton
[3:28:33] Ram_Ranch69: @ColbaeTV what if someone actually buys a Lowkey?
[3:28:34] coatzul: VeryEs Similar shirt
[3:28:35] AnusReaktorMan: Artur o7
[3:28:36] incendiesproductions: It was you first, then Siobhan and then the Mayor the next day IIRC.
[3:28:37] mrballzncedar: It's was you then you took him to Siobhan and I believe Xavier
[3:28:37] hevestarvey420: @Wetidiot seems like it wasnt much better beside maybe offroad
[3:28:41] Zanduin: you were in townhall and you called Sionban to have her come check in work and talk to him
[3:28:42] r3load3d84: running in PD D:
[3:28:42] Dontthinkson: 100% you were first and you esnt him to talk to sio/mayor
[3:28:45] kikisocial: Arthur SAJ

[3:28:47] ahvetv: @EsfandTV just sell your turbos to cops. That way they stay in the PD and you get reinbursed
[3:28:48] the_main_burt: @finalfork its only because he is PPO rn too if he was officer no approval needed
[3:28:49] blahder: But when he talked to cornweod he mentioned he had talked to shioban a bit before hand but didn't think she totay understood or something
[3:28:51] jburke23: DIdn't Oliver try to do the same thing basically?
[3:28:51] BeerRun204: Actually he came to you
[3:28:53] cjdudeman: tazer darts
[3:28:54] GLSMarbles: @EsfandTV He wanted to go to her but couldn't get ahold of her until you helped him to

[3:29:11] Shammyjeff: @imSteffin thanks m8
[3:29:12] xXxEV0xXx: THought he wasnt actually a paid client until after he already told him everything?
[3:29:15] AndHaka54: @EsfandTV just cause you think so doesn't mean they will agree with you
[3:29:18] bphmithraz: but if the mayor said "if you want a super fast car to use you need to save up for it" dsnt that authorise you to use your personal?
[3:29:25] Swabbers: Did you get taser charges ?`
[3:29:27] TheBull14597: did he pick upthe turbo for bones?
[3:29:28] imSteffin: @bphmithraz, no.
[3:29:32] Dash_O_Pepper: Arthur took money from Slacks, I think that's what might hurt him ultimately.
[3:29:32] MDM4ever1986HD: @madman855 yes but they need to raise the money
[3:29:32] HadEbola: @condor2104 they already have guns, these are for civs
[3:29:38] DanLGG: Malton privilege legislation said if an attorney suspects a crime being committed they weren‚Äôt covered and could report
[3:29:41] jacksmithcje: did shiobhan not explain why arthur did nothing wrong there was a word for it
[3:29:42] ahvetv: @EsfandTV sell your turbos to cops. That way they stay in the PD and you get your money back
[3:29:44] imSteffin: @bphmithraz, that is not remotely even close to what he meant by that. He meant the PD has to pool together to purchase faster cars.
[3:29:51] Paudelly: @EsfandTV There is no way that was considered attorney client privilege. He was acting as a prosecutor not as slacks lawyer
[3:29:53] IllusiOGnarly: couldnt you ask devs to have an ai mechanic stationed in motor pool to discount repair if not free repair police vehicles that way you wouldnt have to go to moseleys and you wouldnt have to pay out of pocket cause right now theres no incentive to be a cop other than batman like thirst for justice
[3:29:55] Orbilion: HUH
[3:30:02] evilmoose__: There is a clause in client privilege against malicious prosecution.
[3:30:03] skilleto19: HUH They are what
[3:30:04] Rey40fp: Susge
[3:30:10] Dash_O_Pepper: @imSteffin Any turbo put in a car is liable to get stolen right now. better to hold onto them.

[3:30:57] Dash_O_Pepper: @IllusiOGnarly They've asked to put a mechanic/bench in the motor pool.
[3:31:00] droksid00: @jacksmithcje basically an attorney is not held to privilege if representation would force them to commit a crime. in this instance, malicious prosecution

[3:31:24] Dash_O_Pepper: @ahvetv Better in the locker than in a crim's car. They need to get registration numbers for turbos first.

[3:36:45] The_Strix01: Is there an RP reason why Cornwood keeps so many magazines in his locker that is 10 steps away from an armoury?
[3:36:46] thewookie34: Slacks is such such a interesting character when he isn't glue to MRPD. Him being the other captians fall guy is so annoying. I hope Chief of Police can let some of the leadership off his shoulders.
[3:36:47] SpikerzX: @EsfandTV make contracts for turbos?
[3:36:48] imSteffin: @jacksmithcje, his character doesn't care for money

[3:37:45] thestolentimes: @Esfandtv The PD should seize vehicles involved in drug trafficking and sell them for profit for the PD
[3:37:47] dudemanbroo: you would be splitting the burden of paying for it with the rest of pd
[3:37:47] jburke23: @afkbrb I'm aware. I think it's funny just how psychotic some people can be LuL
[3:37:48] giantpanda: @EsfandTV If they aren't doing PD Budgets etc; does that mean you need to raise capital to open LASO in the first place for it to have a budget?

[3:37:52] Wetidiot: how is pd going to pay you back now when they arent getting state funds
[3:37:53] coppertec: the state is not giving any money to the dept, so youre either waiting until tickets start funding the PD acct, or until officers start contributing to the PD acct
[3:37:55] imSteffin: FirstTimeChatter actually interesting question imo
[3:37:56] cuspeli: I mean sell them to PD individuals
[3:37:57] the_main_burt: only way you getting that money anytime soon is a civil court case

[4:35:08] ArdentCause: He just needs to play CIV, play it as a CIV and not a ccrim, be kind to others, take it on the chin for a bit, and in passing when you see a captain after a few weeks, just ask if there is availability and move on with life

[4:44:02] Liloxcj: @RicoLoco52 Okay if thats the case then he just needs to go down a seperate path now sadly. But i do understand from his perspective they say he is he needs to wait but its been over a month. cornwood waited a week denzel waited 2 and half weeks. and he has waited over a month.

[5:11:33] Gundaree: @Spearrow only seen 2 words from him lol didnt know any of them was considered bad but maybe I missed another message
[5:11:33] Archangel3003: Yeah, if Cornwood was there and had been the first one to shoot, then he would have got a bunch of daps for that
[5:11:33] Paudelly: I can imagine frost getting fired. Thats the 2nd time shes shot when other officers are in the crossfire
[5:11:34] genesissukehiro: @munchkiin_ i mean do you not think Availability and and not able to get ahold of someone could not affect your choice???

[5:15:10] Bill_Collector: Not ppo cornwoods place to stick his nose in it right now
[5:15:10] munchkiin_: @genesissukehiro no, that's a reasonable thing but, the matter of the fact is that he knew Siobhan had her contact info and that he had met her before the decision was made so availability isn't really the excuse here but more just either him being lazy on getting her contact info or just straight up forgetting. He never asked for her contact info iirc. But it is what it is.
[5:15:12] thatRIVERA: it isn't
[5:15:12] al3xb389: Corn fired

[5:15:34] ChaoticSanity: it is because it will involve officer correction/punishment @EsfandTV
[5:15:35] thepixeltavern: This is a 1 life character issue
[5:15:35] fixer_18: If discipline is required it very much is

[5:15:40] NVisionZ: the captain glazing seems kinda meta because you're there lol
[5:15:41] ManakinEU: this is something that should be handled by a captain or higher

[5:15:46] IvyOlive: not for cornwood
[5:15:47] i_am_jam_: some of it isnt chain of command issue but the rest is
[5:15:47] SchizoForever: Cata was always a pain in the ass
[5:15:49] enfranchise_: Well you thought standing up to Mr K wasnt a chain of command issue either Kapp
[5:15:49] god_camnit: they‚Äôll be putting more stuff in the game up north right?
[5:15:51] iwannanuhh: I think the issue could be that no one is patrolling cause everyone is handling issues that COULD be handled by seniors
[5:15:51] SierraSol: Watt saying chain of command then acting like the senior office of the meeting earlier AINTNOWAY
[5:15:56] Crowzone80: there should be a way in the MDT for folks to highlight or i dicate something needs review asap, a HEAT ticket kind of thing

[6:59:26] Usahi_Light: @Redaang Cornwood took his own money and used it to buy his own turbos to give to the PD. Etta basically stole 300,000 dollars and gave it to the PD without permission.
