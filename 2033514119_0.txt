[7:52:30] sarahlouiise96: dundee feels more complete at the billy
[7:52:31] DOWNBAD_ELLY: NEW PLACE NEW BEGINNINGS Prayge
[7:52:32] TheTeaMan: The Billy is home
[7:52:35] SlashThePriest: Ask the gang
[7:52:35] NoranorTV: If you remake bbmc then no doubt the billy
[7:52:38] theextremelylongnamekid: for bbmc yes, but other then that, no
[7:52:38] DieMrCupCake: well its yours if you want it
[7:52:39] lolagin: billy is strategically awesome

[7:52:55] beezo75: take little italy
[7:52:57] spartannx__: u can use the Billy to hide stuff in tho
[7:52:57] alienslx: The nostalgia is strong, but something new is starting
[7:52:58] nomad2955: Industrial area
[7:52:58] skutza: you guys get your own little corner, it's HUUUGE, beautiful scenery etc
[7:53:00] coliinn: maybe somewhere in vinewood
[7:53:01] Nomad_Ninja: yeah, but boat in the canals...
[7:53:07] FriendlyAF88: i think he was pushing for dee to do bbmc,

[7:53:15] xoduh: The circle is way better
[7:53:15] voodookangarroo: SmileW no meta pls
[7:53:18] MDCproject: Be sounded like he wanted Dundee to remake BBMC, MC in the Billabong, led by Dundee....
[7:53:23] Zairichii: Lol
[7:53:24] spartannx__: After Dundee MC
[7:53:24] skutza: it has a very nice meaning - but obvi that's meta KEKW
[7:53:25] mellow_pellow: KEKW
[7:53:25] NoMoseNo: its a nice spot but it will never be the same as it was. i feel like move on and a new ark
[7:53:28] DOWNBAD_ELLY: PepeLaugh SHHHHHH
[7:53:31] skutza: well good menaing
[7:53:40] arthurshelby18: Can't kill what's already dead tho
[7:53:45] tindalowos: ADMC but AD can mean two things
[7:53:51] coliinn: maybe dundee doesnt make a mc in 4.0
[7:53:57] jukey208122: @nomoseno THIS
[7:54:03] sohan_m: Why don't you talk with Barry more??
[7:54:06] Nomad_Ninja: waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaI think Barry just wanted to make sure he was still down to hang with Dee and help him, outside of his group
[7:54:07] nicz76: Norman?
[7:54:10] alienslx: AAAA
[7:54:12] Volanii: @tindalowos microsoft active directory mc

[7:54:14] Nomad_Ninja: lol, oops
[7:54:18] romfi: YesYes
[7:54:19] spartannx__: Then Do it
[7:54:20] FriendlyAF88: if dee wants to call him call him
[7:54:21] the_dmen: you wont
[7:54:23] alienslx: Do it
[7:54:23] skutza: there's a clip of the person who plays solomon explaining it, but idk if that would be meta or not since it's ooc.
[7:54:24] xoduh: do it
[7:54:25] EvlCoyot: Who knows, maybe Barry leaves admc and comes to Dee.
[7:54:27] voodookangarroo: Bensoned
[7:54:29] DOWNBAD_ELLY: OH NO KEKW
[7:54:37] tyrranicus222: Why even be a full crim?
[7:54:39] TheeBudz: Ziggy's in the group so it'll always be attached to norman, Norman is Already Dead
[7:54:43] KAJPack: Bensoned
[7:54:45] SlashThePriest: It is always way too deep when it comes to B
[7:54:49] unleashed_infinity: If D wants too know then a call is fine
[7:54:50] Nomad_Ninja: @skutza yeah, it would be meta, he has to learn within the server
[7:54:53] sohan_m: Bensoned
[7:54:57] voodookangarroo: YesYes no meta
[7:54:57] DOWNBAD_ELLY: Didn't he tell dee why? AAAA
[7:55:02] sidusmoon: YesYes no meta
[7:55:09] FriendlyAF88: NO Spoilers TOM, or i hurt spoon

[7:55:13] Jpoc2012: ha ha
[7:55:13] xoduh: it because you stink whipStinky
[7:55:14] Kinson1: The Billy will not be what it was, and you will continue to compare the old Billy to the new Billy. Old people vs New people. I don't think it would be the best spot to call home. However, for RP, it could be worth trying. I personally think Sandy Shores would be dope with their changes for 4.0
