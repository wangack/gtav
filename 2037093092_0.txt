[0:41:42] Bloodmatch: @wolfabelle I've worked for a debt collection agency they cant do that and sounds like a scam. Legally the bank or whoever you took a loan debt against would notify you of the debt collector buying the debt and dealing with them

[0:53:51] LeMadWurst_: wolfaUgh
[0:53:54] TamiyaCowboy: debt collector agencys tend to buy the debt up from other companys like councils, the council will write the debt off as a tax loss, then that debt is sold on, usually around 1 or 2 pence for every pound owed , thats how they make the money  they buy the debt cheap and take full amount
[0:53:59] TameExpectation: by paying the debt collector you agree to there terms, if you just ignore them and ring the council you would of been able to pay with no extra charges

[0:54:49] JohnJKnapp: In the USA once a debt is charged off by the original lender, interest and fees stop accruing. I‚Äôm surprised it‚Äôs not like that everywhere.
[0:54:50] earlmc87: If you setup a payment plan they get more money over time.
[0:54:55] jummper__: GIGAWOMAN you called her a bitch?

[0:58:32] magic_freak: @moo_of_doom a long time ago I worked at a company that got letters into envelopes and sent off and we did the government collection agency letters. I saw some with an original debt of around ¬£1, for a library late fee, have had it racked up to over 200
[0:58:35] TamiyaCowboy: @pewshee  it would have been sold on by the council, to the debt collector agency, they buy it for cheap usually 1 pence or 2 pence for every pound owed, then the debt company chased the person for the full amount of the debt, thats how they make the money
[0:58:47] TameExpectation: lmfao surly
