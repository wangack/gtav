[4:05:29] RevOReilly: Its funny though because all the images work fine on the external MDT just not in game
[4:05:33] Coasterghost: basically every social media bro wants to be the next Elon Musk. That’s why Reddit charges these day for their API.

[4:06:02] grimblymcgoo: @Coasterghost reddit charges for their api because the company that has never made a single penny of profit pays their ceo 170mil
[4:06:09] emancipationrebellion: FiveM hasn't paid, probably
[4:06:22] RevOReilly: Been since mid last week was when I noticed issues starting to occur
[4:08:24] JordxnFair: I don't know about anything recent but they've been charging for api usage for a while. I think that's partly why reddit built stuff in house.
[4:08:50] JordxnFair: they were free for a while initially but I'm guessing it got kinda expensive
[4:09:14] Coasterghost: @grimblymcgoo Twitter made virtually no profit and a man child bought it for 44B and it’s now worth less then a third of it. You’re point? Reddits head basically said they are following Elon and then when users fought back, they purged everyone.
