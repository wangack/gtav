[2:05:02] gelloz_: "do you love her?"
[2:05:02] sammyk3000: make it a contemptable point that judges can use to keep objections in check frivolous and petty use of objection
[2:05:10] Brave_Mustache: what do you think of the grief objection strategy? Sometimes getting a rise out of someone will make them careless

[2:07:56] Krimitthefrog: What he is saying is on other servers a crim would never get convicted
[2:08:01] BionicFireman: On the one hand a bunch of objections makes the case a slot, but on the other I get a sadistic sense of satisfaction when two attorneys lock themselves in my courtroom for 4 hours due to their own conduct.

[2:11:31] melomaniacjh: 310 30 30 greco
[2:11:36] BionicFireman: Ye, that was something we first experimented on Ignite and it worked real well.
