[0:58:05] Silk_OG: Their early pizzas were a little too experimental for my taste. But when Red Baron's Classic Pepperoni emerged in '83, I think they really came into their own, both commercially and artistically. The whole pizza has a clear, crisp taste and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives it a big boost. It's often compared to other brands, but I find Red Baron's distinct flavor profile carries a sharper, more satisfying edge.

[2:38:07] RubberDingy168: Nice to see there might be a working relationship between WWE and TNA, feels surreal to think about it actually happening
[2:38:08] TacoBlowfish: Pecock is US only. I use a VPN to use the WWE network because its just superior
[2:38:10] tom_artist: i looked it up progress is its own company again now, and wwe network is apparantly going to netflix outside us

[2:38:44] k0rt0pi: I'm glad AEW is around dont think i would care for wrestling as much anymore if AEW wasnt around
[2:38:46] PaleWhiteShadow: I love seeing Sting come back since he'll never wrestle for WWE again
[2:38:47] Domarikat: he is??
[2:38:48] identityevo: I met sabu a few years ago watching him wrestle was so worth it

[2:39:15] IronCladam: Maaaan i wanted to see the rain maker in mania whatever
[2:39:20] RARA_cht: Honestly, I don't see WWE going for Okada. They don't need him, and have nowhere for him. Roster is too stacked
[2:39:22] HighlanderToby: Money makes the world go round. Its why guys are starting to go back and forth from the two companies. All in all, if they boys are getting paid better and treated better. I am all for them competing for a long time :)
[2:39:23] LaerycTiogar: I miss the old days of wrestling Ministry era of WWF
[2:39:25] Ari_Karate: HHH booking is a breath of fresh air if you're a long term viewer tbh
[2:39:27] surf_rose: Do you feel the hype is the same as the attitude era?
[2:39:37] skelet0n1309: ye Khan aint going to run out of money with the fulham, jaguars and AEW
[2:39:38] WaulkingWithDinos: love that tony is also a mark making shows for marks. shits so good
[2:39:47] PaleWhiteShadow: nothing can be as hype as the Attitude Era

[2:41:16] surf_rose: So much that they made that super.bowl commercial
[2:41:18] FutureImpact: I'm going to watch wwe when it comes to Perth but they didnt sell all the seats, priced it way too high which is disappointing
[2:41:18] Geek_Mode_Gaming: i think thats why i hated wrestling at the time.... it was all trash
[2:41:24] iamReddington: @skelet0n1309 :o
[2:41:24] chefboyarezeee: yo you excited for Okada tho?! @Spaceboy
[2:41:25] shake_hands_with_13eef: @ironcladam was kinda a half ass blunder to me 🤷🏼‍♂️
[2:41:27] tom_artist: me and my friends went back and tried to watch it all and nwo was sooo boring looking back, but at the time was amazing
[2:41:29] YungSeiji: I will say, I am more excited about wrestling rn than I have been in 15 years
[2:41:29] Deakula: See DX coming to the ring in blackface*
[2:41:32] idol_spork: I remember having a crush on the Hardy Boys then...
[2:41:32] MostlyLost: That was the decade and a half when America was the only thing resembling a world power
[2:41:32] Chris29Games: are you excited for the next wrestlemania, a lot of REALLY good potential matches even with the injury problems recently
[2:41:47] heyunicornwizard: As a NJPW fan im a fan of a dude named DOUKI and El Desperado
[2:41:51] IronCladam: @shake_hands_with_13eef we talking about the vince stuff?
[2:41:53] Ari_Karate: A lot of generational fans moved on when WCW went out of business tbh
[2:41:53] RARA_cht: I can't go back to the Attitude era bar big PPV matches and stuff, if I try to watch an ep I just cringe every time they have a WWE "Diva" on screen. Especially now with all the info coming out
[2:41:54] kbullen87: the wcw cruiseweight stuff somewhat holds up
[2:41:59] RubberDingy168: Amen

[2:42:23] shake_hands_with_13eef: @ironcladam no the rock booking
[2:42:23] IronCladam: Lmaoooo cody cry babies hahahaa
[2:42:27] WaulkingWithDinos: True
[2:42:29] Guppystreamz: i was really into the WWF as a kid and it faded in the Attitude Era, but ECW re-ignited my love for it, mostly bc the Philly punk and hardcore scene loved them
[2:42:29] surf_rose: Agree
[2:42:33] RubberDingy168: @MatStanton Yeah I heard they pretty much had to make the story less sad to make it more believable
[2:42:33] voltaicoceans: Seth's promo from monday was phenomenal

[2:42:55] idol_spork: Behind the Bastards did a great series on him.
[2:42:58] saltedcoffee525: i honestly know nothing about wrestling
[2:42:59] sugarmounds: why do think he is evil? ive missed what was going on
[2:43:02] Geek_Mode_Gaming: @Spaceboy speaking truth
[2:43:03] surf_rose: He had home runs rarely though
[2:43:05] nebrasken: @spaceboy TRIPLE H AINT SAFE EITHER HE LET THAT SHIT SLIDE
[2:43:05] iamReddington: I recently listened to the Behind The Bastards podcast 6 parter on Vince, it is fucking insane
[2:43:06] theyeatles: facts
[2:43:07] HamLordFergenstein: @sugarmounds the rape mostly
[2:43:11] RARA_cht: Nobody tell Tony Khan that Triple H is booker of the year

[2:43:15] shake_hands_with_13eef: @ironcladam I didn’t mind that the rocks just doing the same old thing since 2012
[2:43:15] skelet0n1309: dont get me wrong vince is bottom of the barrel person but we do have to thank him for the wwe
[2:43:16] Domarikat: VINCE LIKES BIG SWEATY MEN WHO CANT DO SHIT
[2:43:16] WaulkingWithDinos: @iamReddington absolutely! Love more people getting back into it!
[2:43:16] IronCladam: @shake_hands_with_13eef rock booking is good in my opinion we got played to think that hes good but rock is the bad guy the real bloodline boss
[2:43:17] heyunicornwizard: BRING BACK MAURO  MAMA MIA!!
[2:43:17] Chris29Games: undertaker was saying just the other day how calm everything is backstage is these days since vince left when everything used to be chaos and screaming matches
[2:43:19] tyreeiv: you havent learned about ari emanuel yet
[2:43:19] carefulcarter: apparently he took a crap on some drunk girls head once
[2:43:20] fur_baby_momma: YESSSSS 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 thank you for saying that!!!!
[2:43:20] sugarmounds: @HamLordFergenstein what? i never heard about that
[2:43:22] hell_walker46: Who agrees that randy should give Vince what he deserves!
[2:43:22] HighlanderToby: Yeah Vincent can f off. So can jonny ace etc
[2:43:25] xo_valkyrie_ox: My mum watched wrestling growing up but I had no interest & even I knew how awful Vince was just from the odd glance I got of him.
[2:43:30] WaulkingWithDinos: I see 0 lies
[2:43:38] flannelpuppy: he only cared about body builder/strongman wrestlers and gave the shaft to everyone else.
[2:43:40] heyunicornwizard: @HighlanderToby BIG FACTS
[2:43:42] SwayWay08: i think the craziest thing on vince i’ve seen is stephanie saying he wanted to do an incest storyline with him and her
[2:43:42] raz_c0la: So scared spbPictureOfOldMan
[2:43:44] Ulikefishsticks: Server is scuffed today lol
[2:43:45] Ari_Karate: It's getting a lot better from a booking standpoint because a lot of the stories and feuds logically make sense and they've been able to commit to a storyline which is great
[2:43:45] IronCladam: NOOOOOO OFC RAIA HAS TO RUIN THE WRESTLING TAKK
[2:43:45] fur_baby_momma: horrible sexual assaulter 🤬
[2:43:50] PrickBehind: the fact that his “character” was less insane than him in real life.
[2:43:51] ravewizardmerlin: watching wrestling is like watching a soap opera
[2:43:51] IronCladam: Talk
[2:43:51] ohhimarkc: pretty sure wrestling is what caused wrestling fans to get that
[2:43:52] shawking: I know nothing about WWE because i'm European but wasn't there loads of drama with a lot of wrestlers in general
[2:43:53] ConnorLikesCar: is that Poki OMEGALUL
[2:44:00] identityevo: who is better than Roman tho at the moment? I honestly cannot see anyone else carrying that company like Roman can
[2:44:00] StreamElements: identityevo Check to see if the character you're looking for is currently live: https://nopixel.hasroot.com/

[2:44:52] shake_hands_with_13eef: @ironcladam nah saw that coming
[2:44:54] tyreeiv: ari emanuel is also evil just in slightly different ways
[2:44:56] RARA_cht: Probably one of the bullets they put in you when you dropped McNulty yesterday
[2:45:24] HighlanderToby: Who do you think might break out big time in wrestling in 2024? Last wrestling question I promise xD

[2:45:51] skelet0n1309: liv morgan going to beat rhea at mania 100%
[2:45:51] Ari_Karate: @IronCladam the sad part is finding out that the Mr. McMahon character was actually just him IRL doing w/e he wanted to do but it was presented as him being an evil heel to the fans
[2:45:53] th3gildEdsquid: james randal going bullet mode
[2:45:55] MatStanton: Kevin Dunn also left WWE, so production can finally change
[2:45:55] nebrasken: WHOOP THAT TRICK
[2:45:58] IronCladam: @shake_hands_with_13eef me too actually lol. Everyone thought rock came in to just kick cody out and be the actual face. Not too many ppl thought he was gonna be heel  alot of ppl got hoodwinked
[2:46:03] PaleWhiteShadow: @shawking that is what I meant, throughout the history of the WWE quite a number of wrestlers have been arrested or been murdered or become killers... look up Chris Benoit for just one example
[2:46:03] identityevo: lesnar is done
[2:46:06] hell_walker46: I need to see Randell hit the griddy outside the shop
[2:46:07] chefboyarezeee: the rumble was so stacked this year bro

[2:46:34] Rogawsgi: has James been in a Lambo in 4.0?
[2:46:34] surf_rose: Dommink is winning a title
[2:46:36] HighlanderToby: Oh for sure! So many stars already. I don't know much about the Breaker Chap from NXT though
[2:46:39] heyunicornwizard: I think Lexis King will get huge
[2:46:44] NovaSkelly: i got into wrestling over the past year. i love the old wrestling days. favorite was sting
[2:46:46] IronCladam: @ari_karate yeah its really sad but im happy its over. The things he did to his family and his friends and his workers is so vile
[2:46:50] Rachet20: Flying grass. Los Santos is incredible
[2:46:51] k0rt0pi: Logan has been killing it
[2:46:52] IAmKayli123: what do you think of The Rock coming back and what do you think about dominik and rhea ripley?
[2:46:53] rambam4: I think Hornswoggle is going to save the industry
[2:46:53] shake_hands_with_13eef: so many themes suck nowadays
[2:46:54] nebrasken: @domarikat hes a shit head but hes so good in the ring
[2:46:54] IronCladam: Logan farms hate hes the best heel
[2:46:54] Handsomepantsm: I hate how good Logan is
[2:46:55] heyunicornwizard: Logan Paul is an incredible wrestler but a HORRID person
[2:47:00] YungSeiji: perfect heel too
[2:47:01] skelet0n1309: logan is great in wwe
[2:47:04] JoeDoro: He's been wildly entertaining
[2:47:05] heyunicornwizard: i hate that hes so good
[2:47:06] RubberDingy168: Exactly
[2:47:10] HighlanderToby: I honestly hate how good he is lol
[2:47:11] Saumz: When he saved Rey on that botch
[2:47:12] identityevo: sick of people comparing dom to Eddie 🤦‍♂️
[2:47:13] IronCladam: I WANT MJF VS LOGAN
[2:47:13] Saumz: qtpTILT
[2:47:13] Ari_Karate: The thing is that within WWE they have set up a glass ceiling so nobody will be a bigger star than the brand ever again
[2:47:14] Devalahan01: yeah of course hes a good athlete, but hes still a cunt
[2:47:15] flannelpuppy: i dont like him as a person but he does do well in matches for sure
[2:47:17] heyunicornwizard: absolutely
[2:47:18] Fabilord: @heyunicornwizard based
[2:47:19] Chris29Games: ngl im an unapologetic logan fan he has the potential to do great things and is arguably a top guy in wwe rn
[2:47:19] RARA_cht: I hate that he's so good at wrestling. I feel like I need a disclaimer that says "I'm booing you because you're a heel and also because of who you are"
[2:47:21] PrickBehind: honestly insane how much. was amazing.
[2:47:22] smiloe: Logan Paul has a lot of money and he's paid for like the best trainers so of course he's gonna be getting good lol
[2:47:22] Nostari: I was at the Rumble, had decent seats and we didn't know who was coming out
[2:47:23] iamReddington: I can't believe Logan is a great wrestler.  I despise the Paul  brothers, but goddamn he is putting his talent to good use
[2:47:27] IronCladam: Mjf better go to wwe istg
[2:47:34] DeliciousOzone: LUL

[3:15:50] WorstGamr3: Ngl I feel like James is going the right way. The Chaos today felt “cute” like it usually does. No Idea if Spaceboy plans to do some “dark” James Randal Arc or some other 200IQ stuff. I might be picking this up wrong aswell but it also feels like the other RPers are loving the James violence. Anyways I enjoyed James today. Let’s see where it’s going.

[3:19:27] RARA_cht: The people on youtube are watching your edited videos and coming into streams with expectations of constant action/entertainment and don't appreciate downtime vibes/chats imo

[4:04:50] iithum12: Can someone explain Spaceboy to me? I watched his stream for the first time yesterday (always just seen him in clips) and he spent roughly 80-90% of the stream on the ground and in the hospital. Is that what all his streams are? Does he not do anything else but die all day?
[4:04:54] spookemonke: apparently its that guy's first nopixel stream

[4:05:20] WorstGamr3: Ngl I feel like James is going the wrong way. The RP today didn’t feel “cute” like it usually does. No Idea if Spaceboy plans to do some “city hall” James Randal Arc or some other 200IQ stuff. I might be picking this up wrong aswell but it also feels like the other RPers are getting tired of James in the city hall. Anyways I didn’t enjoy James today. Let’s see where it’s going.

[4:26:01] Nightbot: In the grand tapestry of civilization, ads play a pivotal role in advancing society. They propel the wheels of progress by showcasing new ideas, innovations, and breakthroughs. From introducing life-changing products to announcing medical breakthroughs, ads enable us to stay informed and connected with the ever-evolving world around us. Without them, our knowledge would stagnate, and the spark of ingenuity might fade into obscurity.
