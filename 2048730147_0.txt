[0:11:44] c0nundrum01: whats up baby face
[0:12:19] c0nundrum01: when you joining NP?
[0:12:57] papascrub: will we ever get a cheese cam again
[0:13:19] Jemmyb00: I think they should still be high price but not 70k... maybe like 15-20k and the bullets reduced to 500dollars from i think they're 1k each
[0:14:33] Jemmyb00: Yeah cause you still gotta be willing to waste 20k a pop but like it's still semi-affordable....
[0:16:45] Jemmyb00: cause we figured out as well like if we arrest someone for Aggravated battery thats 14k fine + 35 months right... but then you take their gun... thats 70k loss... you taake potential knives, drugs and whatever thats like maybe another 2-5k... so Aggro Battery becomes a loss of almost 100k + time which is sooo excessive
[0:19:35] Jemmyb00: Matic knows about that but if you drive in a straight line through it you can come out the other side LOL
[0:19:52] Jemmyb00: Rhinehart Torrence and Fugitive
