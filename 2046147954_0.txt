[7:14:59] Zewelly: in 3.0 werent bushes broken? people with bad computers would have low texture and could see in bushes while people with nice pcs couldnt see because they had more textures
[7:15:00] BlacKnight2514: @fiction12211 CG overcomplicated this house. a secret door to the basement is all you needed not all this garden bullshit and trap rooms thta is just wasting and taking up spcae for other better things
[7:15:35] woahdrey: i think the house is fine... this wont be CG's forever home
[7:15:56] Zewelly: yeah i think cg are gonna move houses but it still ass
[7:16:04] fiction12211: @woahdrey agree I could see them doing something different for the next house
[7:16:23] Hdotkayy: @Zewelly we get it bro you don't like the house
[7:16:24] Zewelly: problem is no one wants to spend 8 hours redoing a house
[7:16:26] azmer1987: timmacSHRUG

[7:17:29] deivdeivdeiv: need more light in here
[7:17:29] notwowayzz: how many butcoin y'all have now?
[7:17:38] BlacKnight2514: for the room feture to work properly you need to have each room closed off with doors @Timmac
[7:17:44] lightofgleipnir_: LOL chodie just sitting there
[7:17:47] malanQ: u need to make folders in placed tab @timmac
[7:17:47] fiction12211: yeah idk why he sold stuff to Vinny when this house is not done haha
[7:17:50] Rxch0: whats the drying times on the bigger racks
[7:17:53] C_G1: I think it only works for properly set up homes with actual walls and doors to each level, since this is all open I think it still loads everything
[7:18:01] azmer1987: LUL hea chillin probably with paper shoved up his nose
[7:18:10] R3dl1nes: i remember mr k saying any one that wants to redo it please do
[7:18:26] pompz88: do you not need to link the items in the room to the room?
[7:18:35] beasty2k21: ye k is hap[py for a better house
[7:18:55] azmer1987: @c_g1 aren't they all open empty until purchased and done by owner?

[7:20:00] azmer1987: @malanq whats the purpose though?
[7:20:03] Hdotkayy: weed and pc's should have their own seperate room
[7:20:11] fiction12211: weed room, server room, washer room
[7:20:15] voidxd02: would be nice to make it more like a home instead of a rust base xd
[7:20:18] mizledTV: yeah walls with doors. give Bobby b a small room to put all his trash on the ground lol
[7:20:34] fiction12211: walls will be good
[7:20:34] cybigil: Siz mentioned the large storage containers.  That would help.
[7:20:38] malanQ: do it
[7:20:44] jacob3577888: You guys should get multiple houses said there‚Äôs one house
[7:20:45] BlacKnight2514: get rid of the trap room it poitnless, it just take up space.
[7:20:47] Hdotkayy: how expensive would it be to do?
[7:20:52] R3dl1nes: yeah layouts needed bad with walls and doors and security panel needs to be moved defo
[7:20:58] MrYeOLDsNIPeR: yessir

[7:21:10] b_goodhue: Are you gonna be able to get out of that trap door even if u move the wall in editor mode
[7:21:27] azmer1987: Floors would make jt insanely different
[7:21:29] mizledTV: it‚Äôs going to be harder to redecorate the more stuff you guys add
[7:21:45] R3dl1nes: question is @Timmac  what is the base price of those storages because ppl be marking them up mad because they a new thing
[7:21:50] 5nthony: lighting would probably help too

[7:23:55] mizledTV: different textures and colors per floor
[7:23:56] Lavitzboss: to make floors from wood instead of the utool rip off
[7:24:22] DocRavage: asked the wood guys if they can make it cheaper?
[7:24:39] CopitoCAB: did any of u guys follow up with the lumber people for the cheaper walls?
[7:24:39] jacob3577888: You guys spend all this money on the southside house
[7:24:46] beasty2k21: easier with right panne;
[7:24:51] pompz88: unfortunately someone just has to do it. Dont bother asking. Otherwise it doesnt get done
[7:25:14] Hey_its_Mady: 'Link room' only works if you create a room with walls and door. This makes that room a different entity which can load when someone opens the door.
[7:25:25] gamma_smash: k almost burnt the house down on a wood floor
[7:25:28] mizledTV: I‚Äôm here for the 24 hr decorating stream
[7:25:40] trader455: @mizledTV fax

[7:25:41] BlacKnight2514: funny thing is CG have spent so much money on the interior of this house but its not even done and it looks like ass KEKW money wasted
[7:25:42] b_goodhue: If anyone goes into the trap door are you gonna be able to get them out with the stuff there
[7:25:58] dankNbeans: Richard would probably be a pro at this
[7:26:25] mizledTV: Richard would just make weird sex dungeons he locks people in
[7:26:43] Raven_SOA: @mizledTV and that's a bad thing right
[7:26:56] Zewelly: anyone an irl architect
[7:27:00] fiction12211: brick walls in the basement would look cool too

[7:31:02] KR1S7Y11: xl vs xxl?
[7:31:09] reakwon_: why not just use the XL who cares if it bleeds into the side of the walls, its underground anyways
[7:31:17] dankNbeans: a woman's touch: throw 50K at it, and nobody likes it
[7:31:21] dankNbeans: lol
[7:31:27] thedrakmer69: No wonder Carmella asks for 20k+
[7:31:28] Azzarill: wall it off for secret rooom
[7:31:28] Lavitzboss: overlapping XLs might be cheaper than using like 10 large to fill the rest
[7:32:02] RisKkeyy: Just throw up some walls or some shit along the unfinished parts instead of covering them

[7:33:17] BlacKnight2514: also there is differnt types of flooring that would like better than the wood, there is a grey carpet one that would like sick in the basement @Timmac

[8:54:41] MaxMcGee: nope
[8:54:52] Adams2303: @Timmac so basically split the house into floors and each floor into rooms even, it doesn't only help organize things for future designing but also optimizes client performance when getting close to your house (stutters and freezes).
[8:55:22] Blue_Walsh: Pretty lame you can't pick multiple objects at once
[8:55:30] U62charlie: well at least it is drying then
[8:55:47] sturg2k5: this is better than filling paperwork in lol
[8:55:53] BlacKnight2514: a simple fix that would make this all better is change the house wall color plz KEKW grey or white would make it look clean isntead of this piss yellow @Timmac
[8:56:04] ItsEdBoi_: Might help to drag the folder up for some stuff as well, if thats possible

[10:02:27] Fatass_Drew: looks like the wood floor could be rotated width wise and cover a lil bit more ground?
[10:02:36] Hey_its_Mady: Grass is the floor
[10:02:37] deivdeivdeiv: the trap room, should that not be see through so you see who is trapped
[10:02:46] xl__8s: secret room above the workbench

[10:05:35] Adams2303: @Timmac you could reuse the preexisting floors on the 2nd to get most space with them no?
[10:05:42] mizledTV: why don‚Äôt you just design it and people can buy the stuff when they have it?

[10:42:25] P1_Pookie: just rack
[10:42:25] BlacKnight2514: rack for now
[10:42:26] U62charlie: no reason to get advanced GPU yet
[10:42:27] halos420: i would only do a rack
[10:42:36] Azzarill: rack u can sell
[10:42:41] killogic916: @ItsEdBoi_ I agree, you just sell the excess to make the rack pay itself back
[10:42:45] appleceee: yall should stack up to like 10 racks and then slowly switch out the old GPUS with new ones
[10:42:47] ItsEdBoi_: Build racks until u cant add anymore to pc then upgrade to better ones
[10:42:54] cybigil: Could buy both and try to sell a complete setup, but people are starting to get cheap
[10:42:55] Hey_its_Mady: Maybe advanced GPU for the main PC
[10:42:56] jasonquinn2022: there no reason to buy one of the gpu you need 10 for it to work
[10:42:57] BlacKnight2514: @appleceee agreed
[10:43:02] Blue_Walsh: You only get one use out of the rack blueprint?
[10:43:05] Lordbidwell: A trip you say

[10:43:45] appleceee: would be nice to have enough racks to make 1 BUTC / Hour
[10:43:54] U62charlie: it‚Äôs 5 Butcoin PER Advanced GPU‚Ä¶. so it‚Äôs not worth it until they are taking in a lot of buttcoin
[10:43:58] Ord1125: Holy crap Heilung!!!
[10:44:24] ConanKing10: i think the advaced gpu blueprint is more than 1 gpu
[10:44:36] ind_i_go: Listening
[10:44:43] BlacKnight2514: @Timmac @ConanKing10 yep its 3 per BP
[10:44:57] ConanKing10: probably worth then

[10:45:17] Hey_its_Mady: If you gonna buy new GPU then use it only in the pc desk to double the production. Not worth filling a whole rack with new ones
[10:45:39] Lordbidwell: HypeFighter HypeSwipe heliung makes me want to storm the beaches and raid rival houses
[10:45:57] ItsEdBoi_: Does it double the PC to 2? if so yea thats worth

[10:47:26] Hey_its_Mady: But you spend 50 butc to increase production by +2
[10:47:37] ItsEdBoi_: only for pc since it gives u 1 extra btc for 1, the ones in the rack only give .2 extra
[10:47:43] BlacKnight2514: should def have some of the Advanced GPUs, get a rack crafting and then get the new GPUs and fill the rack with that @Timmac
[10:47:44] Cruzier2012: chill song i like it
