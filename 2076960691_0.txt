[8:30:36] josiahju: he’s definitely very hard to read
[8:30:39] MachineDoll: crystWiggle
[8:31:11] Rahjoth: Of course. As Greg would say: "Can't fully trust anyone in this business."
[8:31:25] Rahjoth: Yeah!
[8:31:29] josiahju: like when you brought up business yesterday he became very scary tone
[8:31:46] chaosgeek1: He can explain stocks to you now crystLUL
[8:31:54] Rahjoth: @chaosgeek1 TRUE
[8:32:50] Rahjoth: I think a big difference between the two is confidence. Swan is maximo confidence. Marv is confident, but his self-consciousness bleeds through here and there in the way he tries to intimidate people here and there ( kinda like a bully ).
[8:33:09] chaosgeek1: Maybe, from when I hung out in his stream he likes Strategy games, and RP in them but that's more worldbuilding RP and something completely different than Person to Person RP
[8:33:27] chaosgeek1: He's very good at RP anyway
[8:33:29] frozonhawk: it does and marv pokes at it
[8:33:38] miss_daydreamer: crystLUL
[8:33:54] Rahjoth: I hear you. It is hard playing a character with a completely different personality in some places. crystLost
[8:34:28] josiahju: the real question is, is marv lying to swan
[8:34:49] Rahjoth: It's very laudable. crystLove
[8:34:58] Rahjoth: @josiahju Of course. They're lying to each other. crystSmirk
[8:35:29] chaosgeek1: It doesn't feel like he is lying... well the rizz and counter rizz is lying, but I think Marv actually likes Swan
[8:36:06] josiahju: I love that marv defuses swans rizz with counter rizz
[8:36:16] Rahjoth: @chaosgeek1 I don't think he's *completely* lying, no. I think he appreciates Swan, definitely.
[8:36:34] frozonhawk: swan seems to lack, being able to see future potential in things, i feel like its apt as she probably had to worry about the now more than the future
[8:36:34] Rahjoth: @josiahju KEK
[8:37:23] josiahju: to be fair marv seems to sweet talk everyone
[8:37:23] Rahjoth: @frozonhawk She's pretty creative, though. Maybe specific things? Maybe she is capable, but it's been blunted for the reasons you say. NODDERS
