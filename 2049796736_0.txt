[4:42:54] iamSamm_: D: poor JJ
[4:43:17] Mistborn95: @curvyelephant from what i've been told the reason for the testing is that it is significantly more difficult to diagnose adhd in adults especially the non-hyperactive form of it because of how people are able to mask symptoms they struggled with as a child. so they have to do extra stuff to be able to confirm diagnosis unless it's very apparent that they have adhd which is what i'm assuming happened in your childhood is that it was noticeable, so they were able to suggest it was a possibility
[4:43:28] Lethalized86: No pixel should add a teacup holding emote
[4:43:30] JSHReaper: WAYTOODANK
[4:44:39] FangirlVsTheWorld: It took me years to be diagnosed as autistic and now I‚Äôm waiting for a ADHD assessment!
[4:44:40] random_viewer_55: Rhodes is in a good mood today
[4:46:40] Mistborn95: 100% i know what you mean but i don't outwardly present symptoms but i feel the effects of it on the inside. For example my brain never shuts off and for that reason sleep is extremely difficult for me to come by and a "sleep Schedule" is like a foreign concept
[4:47:35] FangirlVsTheWorld: @mistborn95 This!! Sleep is impossible!

[4:50:25] Thallo_Auxo: so close to a robo-pancreas
[4:50:32] Firsthandpower: I went to therapy with a psychologist and specifically asked to be diagnosed with depression/anxiety disorder/ptsd
[4:50:36] iamSamm_: mittens curvyeLove
[4:50:48] PepperAnn131: If you say things like that out loud, it helps you remember. Like when you get out of your car and later you don't remember if you locked the car or not. That happened a lot to me and now I always say out loud: "Locked" and I never forget it anymore.
[4:50:52] Firsthandpower: They never actually did and I was so pissed. Felt like a waste of time
[4:51:15] Firsthandpower: They said we'll if you feel like you do then.
[4:52:01] Mistborn95: another thing that i have that is pointing me in the direction of getting this testing done is what i've heard called executive dysfunction. TLDR i have things i know i need to do for example doing the dishes, i want to do it and i know i need to but i physically cannot force myself into going and doing it. It leads to a lot of issues of people being labeled as lazy when it's actually adhd
[4:52:52] mittensduck73: i think i do that as well mist Hmmmm
[4:53:12] iamSamm_: getting on anti-depressants changed my life. it isn‚Äôt a perfect fix, but it helped significantly. talk to your family doctor about it. most are open to the discussion, Power.
[4:53:28] Thallo_Auxo: @iamSamm_ peepoHappy
[4:53:29] Mistborn95: ^yes samm
[4:53:58] xCommunity: Yeah. Getting onto anti-depressants and going through the process of finding the right one honestly changed my life.
[4:54:11] Thallo_Auxo: stigmas attached to medication is wild
[4:54:19] mittensduck73: anti- depressants are not perfect at all it can take many tries to find the best med that works for you but once you do find them it help soooooo much
[4:54:34] RhiaAndTheMoon: the thing I tell most people about anti-depressants is stick with it for at least a month - they can have some side effects that go away after some time and that leads some people to quit before it can have an effect NODDERS
[4:55:03] iamSamm_: med changes are hard. I‚Äôm struggling with it right now, but I know there are options and my doctor is willing to discuss it with me.
[4:55:32] mittensduck73: there is also stigma with invisible shit as well cause people cant see it
[4:55:34] iamSamm_: the value in having a good doctor that you trust is huge

[4:57:52] Firsthandpower: My bf has adhd. It's wild how people with adhd function. I read up on it before since I wanted to be well informed and a good partner. He leaves out sandwhich ingredients out after and leaves the cabinet doors open. I understand and he doesn't mean to do it his brain just thinks about the next thing. I think it's important as a good partner to learn about mental health conditions they have
[4:58:07] preznm: holy essaying
[4:58:17] Thallo_Auxo: @Firsthandpower peepoWow
[4:58:31] Thallo_Auxo: @preznm We are having a discussion
[4:58:43] lulzification: @Firsthandpower peepoWow Your partner is the best
[4:58:53] Mistborn95: i am trying my best to stay on my anti-depression, anxiety and diabetes meds but imma be honest it's been really hard to stay on top of it
[4:59:01] Tambooob: My psychiatrist has me trying Lions Mane mushroom supplements for my ADHD and brain fog now. I'm resistant to all medications that treat such things, and I gotta say, it's been pretty helpful.
[4:59:06] mittensduck73: you make an excellent point first it is important to learn about your partners mental health conditions
[4:59:13] Thallo_Auxo: @Mistborn95 Alarms and routine
[4:59:14] JSHReaper: Family member of mine is bi polar and its crazy how some people simply doesn't understand what that entails and just labels them as crazy or lazy depending on their state of mind
[4:59:41] RhiaAndTheMoon: don't get me started on personality disorders, they are so misunderstood - it's wild
[5:00:22] Firsthandpower: @jshreaper my bf is also bipolar. Yep. The stigma around being bipolar is such a shame.
[5:00:28] Thallo_Auxo: @RhiaAndTheMoon 100% and lots of people think a certain diagnosis or trait means you're evil
[5:00:29] iamSamm_: A lot of times the people making those assumptions are the ones that have their own mental struggles and aren‚Äôt willing to acknowledge them.
[5:00:43] Mistborn95: that's the thing thallo that doesn't really help me because if i'm in the middle of hyper fixating on something then either i won't pay attention to the alarm or i'll turn it off and say "i'll do it in a minute" but then in a minute never comes
[5:01:09] Thallo_Auxo: @Mistborn95 snooze it, dont turn it off!
[5:01:18] mittensduck73: oh god i knew a old friends mum who has bipolar and i learnt a bit of the stigma before i met them and my god they were no were near the stigma i learnt but this is my personal experience

[5:01:47] JSHReaper: @Firsthandpower Yeah my family member has never ever been violent or anything like that, but yet some are "afraid" of them just because they might act erratic at times that they are manic
[5:02:02] iamSamm_: I‚Äôve seen my mom have anxiety and depression firsthand and she never took mine seriously until I had an absolute meltdown many years ago. It scared her.
[5:02:20] mittensduck73: oh god samm curvyeHug
[5:02:28] Thallo_Auxo: There's been like one time on stream you noticed you were getting angy at things and called it
[5:03:27] Firsthandpower: @jshreaper yep. Manic means so many different things to certain people. My bf NEVER gets violent but when my fam found out they were scared for me. I explained to them and then they understood. But because people don't know any better it continues
[5:03:34] LukeKR95: did you get snappy?
[5:03:37] iamSamm_: I‚Äôve become this like‚Ä¶ master of masking my anxiety, but when I‚Äôm depressed it‚Äôs hard to hide.
[5:03:57] Thallo_Auxo: To us viewers you didnt seem angy but beepo was very vocal
[5:04:20] Tambooob: I've been doing more research on blood sugar and whatnot. I'm leaning that people with autism, such as myself, have issues with low blood sugar more often than others. Especially in the overnight/morning hours. It really explains why I'm such a bitch in the morning lmao. curvyeLUL
[5:04:54] goldtrendy: Im like that when my sensory issues skyrocket but identifying thats why in the moment is so hard curvyeLUL
[5:04:56] Silvertap: The problem is that people uses one disease to justfy every fault they have... If u have an atention and/or hiper activity problem it should be just that...
[5:05:03] Thallo_Auxo: @iamSamm_ LUL im the opposite
[5:05:37] Firsthandpower: @iamsamm_ yeah my parents are immigrants so they didn't ever really know about mental health. So thankful my mom took me seriously when I told her I couldn't handle my depression and she realized her daughter was sleeping all day and Super irritable
[5:05:43] FangirlVsTheWorld: @tambooob That explains so much!!
[5:05:45] RhiaAndTheMoon: ADHD and eating are rough, sometimes you forget/delay for hours and then the hangry kicks in
[5:05:45] mittensduck73: same samm but i mask both depression and anxiety but i cant mask it perfectly like if you really really look you can see when im in a mood ect
[5:05:46] Mistborn95: i've never been able to hide my emotions even if i'm trying to protect someone else's feelings because saying my true emotions would be very hurtful
[5:05:54] AnticrosslandDraws: I identify heavily with this conversation, but adhd is saying I don't get to focus on it.
[5:06:04] Thallo_Auxo: I visibly tremble if I'm anxious, like a chihuahua
[5:06:45] miaws_o7: Classic
[5:07:00] iamSamm_: I wish, Thallo. I just completely withdraw and don‚Äôt respond to anyone. Even on an SSRI, it doesn‚Äôt stop the feelings of not feeling worthy of existing.

[5:08:19] Firsthandpower: @mittensduck73 I have hyperhidrosis so I throughly relate lolll. My hands sweat so much when I'm anxious
[5:08:31] Firsthandpower: Twice the amount
[5:08:43] mittensduck73: omg same firsthand my hands my fucking god they sweat
[5:08:51] Mistborn95: bro curvy i went to make dinner in the crock pot, threw everything in and turned it on. 6 hours later i realized i didn't smell food cooking and i turned around to look at it and it wasn't plugged in
[5:09:07] Firsthandpower: Yep and feet :( I'm lucky though no pitties
[5:09:50] Firsthandpower: I'm thankful. Buy hyperhidrosis in of itself worsened my anxiety growing up. Never wanting to hold hands. Such low self esteem issues
[5:09:56] Thallo_Auxo: I learnt really quickly to be on top of my medication routine because I HURT if I'm not on time or forget
[5:10:07] Thallo_Auxo: PETTHEBEEPO
[5:10:10] Tambooob: With my ADHD, I always end up putting things where they dont belong. I've most certainly put the milk in the cupboard before, while something like peanut butter ended up in the fridge.
[5:10:36] iamSamm_: I‚Äôve just become super selective of the people I surround myself with. Maybe that was age, but I know what triggers my depression & anxiety. People yelling, super negativity, and so on.
[5:11:14] Thallo_Auxo: @iamSamm_ Both NODDERS with age you learn to protect your peace
[5:11:21] Tambooob: Same, Sam. I really can't do people who yell. Instant fight or flight response.

[5:12:57] otterdangerous: agreed 100000%
[5:13:17] otterdangerous: ive been misdiagnosed so many times
[5:13:18] Mistborn95: yeah rhia i can't listen to "asmr" sounds that are supposed to be soothing they make me super triggered @RhiaAndTheMoon
[5:13:24] RhiaAndTheMoon: oh I have had my mental health diagnoses changed/added to so many times
[5:13:26] iamSamm_: I bought a pill box that has AM and PM boxes and I just use all of them for my AM meds. So I can lay out two week‚Äôs worth and put them beside my bed to take every morning.
[5:13:30] FangirlVsTheWorld: I get that with my Fibromyalgia! There are so many different symptoms connected to it but they don‚Äôt all show in bloodwork or scans!
[5:13:36] a3ira: I‚Äôm new to diabetes, got diagnosed with type 1 back in March. I get high blood sugar than I do low blood sugar. I only have my blood glucose meter and my insulin pen. Are there better devices or things to take of diabetes? I new to it all

[5:15:42] curdi317: I‚Äôve had I think 18 vials of blood drawn back in December testing for something. Everything came back negative, and there‚Äôs no reason for what had happened. It‚Äôs frustrating not having answers but nice to know I‚Äôm healthy
[5:15:58] hpfan27: Found  out I have border line autism

[5:16:55] hpfan27: I also get frustrated at the drop of a hat so thinking I should check for other things just to make sure
[5:17:00] Mermodoc: only positive of the camera down the throat is that i now have photos of my throat from the inside and i know i have diaphragmatic hernia

[5:17:14] Firsthandpower: Hate the Healthcare system it's disgusting but that's another discussion
[5:17:17] amber_bijoux: it was a trial and error to find the correct anti-depressants after the first one made me sleep all the time and eat so much. don‚Äôt be afraid to speak up and talk to your doctor and tell them all of the side-effects and get something that works for you. I am blessed so be in the pharmaceutical department so I had coworkers that could help me notice side effects and prompt me to seek a change
[5:17:23] RhiaAndTheMoon: I had a period of time where my meds was fucking with my blood sugar and making it low - I was terrified I would go to sleep and not wake up
[5:17:26] otterdangerous: @curdi317 i hear ya on that. Ive had over 43 different CT scans/MRIs to try and figure out what is wrong with me and they still cant figure it out.
[5:17:33] iamSamm_: curvy, have they considered that a med might be causing the residual cough? the dr I worked for told me once that omeprazol was notorious for that.
[5:17:59] curdi317: @otterdangerous ugh I hope you get answers soon!!
[5:18:05] a3ira: i need to get a better blood glucose meter too honestly

[5:19:45] amber_bijoux: also don‚Äôt be afraid to ask your local pharmacy if there are any coupons for your diabetes supplies and cgm supplies you would be surprised what they know and we can usually get you a free meter and help you in the right direction
[5:20:27] iamSamm_: 100% Amber. or for discounts on meds in general. a lot of times they have good-rx discount cards that can help.
