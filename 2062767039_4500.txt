[1:15:09] inus2: is there like.. a garland or something that could be hung from the hearth above the fireplace to fill space?
[1:15:13] TKE_Super_Dave: Probably more space
[1:15:14] bartxn: @adameljefe np uwuLOVE
[1:15:14] squoogelol: could make it wider and move the hole
[1:15:18] Anrisacia: I think you had made it much wider in the first iteration
[1:15:22] Vizi797: yea the last one felt okay, this one feels huge though
[1:15:31] Anrisacia: So it made it look more reasonable
[1:15:47] squoogelol: or shorter and you would crouch through
[1:15:50] ScarletThePaladin: So how many people asked andi to be there V day?
[1:15:51] TKE_Super_Dave: Just say it's so Santa can come down the chimney easier for Christmas.

[1:24:00] AdamElJefe: Damnit Tyler

[1:24:34] Anrisacia: Person just leaves halfway through the song assuming it's not them because they won't say who it is KEKW
[1:26:02] Tyler4AM: That would be a great music video. It ends with him walking like 5 miles home by himself
[1:26:26] aconfused_melon: Stare you’ve been singing since I told you to leave, get off the property.

[1:28:38] AdamElJefe: That's what hockey players have
[1:28:54] bartxn: to me it's a fake smile
[1:29:06] polken2: I think its like pretending to be happy, so like a fake smile.
[1:29:06] bartxn: like smile through ur tears or whatever
[1:29:08] Vizi797: I always assumed it just meant she doesn’t smile because it’s broken, but you’re the singer here so you’re probably right
[1:29:09] Tyler4AM: Yeah but Creep is supposed to be creepy
[1:29:10] imdeatht1: Smiling but sad eyes
[1:29:13] Tyler4AM: Maroon 5 just is creepy

[1:49:02] opalducky: I bet she just wanted to eat some messy stadium food and not even be noticed
[1:49:26] Vizi797: Little known fact, when she was 4 years old, a football knocked over her sand castle, and this is her long plan revenge NODDERS
[1:49:29] ItsJardo: ngl 10 years ago id never guess how big Taylor would have gotten its impressive
[1:49:30] aconfused_melon: I saw that they have a subreddit already desiccated to them MAAAAN
[1:49:36] Tyler4AM: I did see something on twitter where people were reacting to Taylor's face when Travis Kelce was being interviewed postgame and about how she apparently had the 'ick'
[1:49:48] zeman94: Some dads are loving it because there daughters now watch football with them

[1:54:11] Tyler4AM: It was the weirdest school assembly I've ever been to
[1:54:28] opalducky: Yup

[1:55:17] Tyler4AM: *fans
[1:55:27] ItsJardo: theyre the new generation of 1D fans only somehow not as crazy
[1:55:38] DJ_4point0: I do find it a little scary that one person can hold that much power and influence, but there are better examples for that than Taylor
[1:55:45] Anrisacia: @Tyler4AM I wouldn't be totally surprised if there's some crossover there kivaLUL
[1:55:47] maxidda: actual factions within the Swifties base

[2:02:29] AdamElJefe: there's just a pile of smashed alarm clocks in the corner
[2:02:36] opalducky: I once switched it with the meme version of the song too
[2:04:49] opalducky: I have this thing where someone calls me and I wake up 30 minutes later no matter when my alarm is

[2:37:36] Tyler4AM: Lemme look on 7tv lol
[2:38:44] Tyler4AM: Ok so there's some amazing locked in emotes but I have no idea how you'd make it with Ruka lmao
[2:39:17] Tyler4AM: True
[2:39:27] Tyler4AM: I'll post a couple in the discord
[2:39:43] ItsJardo: just a Blue padlock with focused Ruka Eyes
[2:41:01] AdamElJefe: wasnt the music video for that song them pulling a bank heist?
[2:41:07] squoogelol: wonder if theres room to jump up to a smaller secret room above the fireplace
[2:41:23] ItsJardo: missy higgins is great
[2:41:33] Steambottom: very nice
[2:41:48] Random_Slacker: could use the upper area for more racks maybe
[2:41:57] inus2: The opposite could be a good one too, an unfocused / vacant looking ruka to use when characters aren't paying attention (Julio etc)
[2:42:50] Steambottom: so much secret space for activities
[2:44:01] lichadez: wouldnt a hole in the roof be easier to hide than a side wall
[2:45:38] lichadez: angle the front of the roof down so its harder to see the roof
[2:46:03] wizardiis: KEKW

[2:50:58] lichadez: climb up into back instead of side
[2:51:06] SavageSIKMplays: WOW
[2:51:25] lichadez: then drop down again
[2:51:36] Random_Slacker: instead of having the climbing up on the left, maybe do it on the right? and keep hallway
[2:51:37] lichadez: leave the hole
[2:51:47] tyleigh_reese: you’ll have to jump up twice
[2:52:00] lichadez: climb over fireplace wall
[2:52:33] VoltHound: yes
[2:52:35] Matt_a_Gamer_Kappa: NODDERS
[2:52:56] tyleigh_reese: make a platform above to jump down into the fireplace, yea
[2:53:08] lichadez: it looks like theres room but i could be room
[2:53:23] Steambottom: what if the climb up just leads to a attic space instead of the basement?
[2:53:44] Random_Slacker: your gonna hate this, but it might be easier to just delete everything back here.. start clean
[2:53:45] lichadez: why does wodd need to be hidden in that room?
[2:53:49] Random_Slacker: and maybe use less small blocks if possible
[2:55:33] Vizi797: @lichadez the bench is in there, that needs the wood for stuff

[2:58:31] Random_Slacker: could you have a small opening in the wall behind the wood storage? so you could pull wood directly from it into bench room
[2:58:43] Random_Slacker: or is that too powerful
[2:59:40] Scoobyk: Can you fit a wood storage or something in the behind fireplace?
[3:00:11] Random_Slacker: yeah figured it would be a bit much, just trying to reduce tediousness, haha
[3:00:41] Steambottom: great spot to hide when the police invade
[3:01:30] lichadez: yo that looks like a good degen hole for reed to hoard his stuff
[3:02:46] Tyler4AM: I love this song because B.O.B. is a flat earther and the idea of airplanes disproves flat earth theory
[3:02:48] elvic_: but i could really use a wish rn though
[3:02:58] ItsJardo: id be worried if i saw an airplane that looked like a shooting star
[3:03:04] Tyler4AM: Yeah lol
[3:03:16] AdamElJefe: oh yeah I forgot that he was KEKW
[3:03:39] elvic_: every time I hear this song I think of the cringe fan made my little pony video
[3:04:07] Matt_a_Gamer_Kappa: if the wall is the same colour you prob wont see the hole unless you have a flashlight kivaSus
[3:04:41] Tyler4AM: Why is you quietly singing along to this song highkey better than the original
[3:06:21] AdamElJefe: peepoGiggles
[3:06:21] Tyler4AM: Ok now you're just a country icon
[3:07:10] elvic_: Have you seen the preview for the show Damsel? I feel like it might interest you kivaSip

[3:08:56] Tyler4AM: "Imma fuckin catch you"
[3:08:58] SciNetwork: this entrance is so cool kivaPog
[3:09:40] redalien7: plus no one ever looks up NODDERS
[3:09:44] AdamElJefe: and the firs def won't burn them right?
[3:09:49] AdamElJefe: fire*
[3:10:24] AdamElJefe: Ahh okay
[3:10:33] AdamElJefe: let's hope so Prayge
[3:10:54] Epeonv1: are there like little log props you put put at the base of the fake fire
[3:10:57] SciNetwork: people avoid fire so much, good deterrent for the entrance.
[3:11:13] lichadez: i wish houses had differing layouts instead of just expanded basement walls
[3:11:23] lord_dragox412: @SciNetwork So what you're saying is notHoA aren't people 'cause they're attracted to fire KEKW

[3:14:46] Steambottom: like a fake chimney?
[3:14:47] zeman94: Corner
[3:14:47] Random_Slacker: I guess it could pass for a chimney then, to have it in the middle
[3:14:49] maxidda: majority of the shadow is on the left it's perfect as is
[3:15:10] zeman94: ^
[3:15:42] Random_Slacker: it is visible for me atleast, but I bet with cluttering around the fireplace it wouldnt be noticeable

[3:17:40] Random_Slacker: considering where people are spending time in the room and the angles

[3:40:18] daveisghost: Honestly.. more like 3 different vibes. This. The twerk years.. and now a bit in the middle.
[3:40:31] ItsJardo: wasn’t there a theory that she went off the rails to get out of her Disney contract or did i just deep dive into conspiracies
[3:41:02] Tyler4AM: Honestly I wouldn't be surprised if that's a thing Jardo, but also I think the drugs helped too
[3:41:44] opalducky: I always thought that's why she did it

[3:55:25] zeman94: Ya
[3:55:55] Tyler4AM: Honestly I don't hate Nickelback, just not a fan. Feel like they made This Is How You Remind Me and then kinda just repeated that for like 20 years
[3:56:12] ItsJardo: i love nickleback i saw them LIVE and they were really good

[5:25:30] GalovicV: Jolene be like: "I'm not Jolene, tf is wrong with you"
[5:27:49] opalducky: My interpretation is dolly not feeling stable in the relationship and venting that it would be quite easy for any "Jolene" to take him. Cuz the name Jolene was literally just a little girl and Dolly liked the name. kivaLUL
