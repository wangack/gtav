[1:22:39] Nightbot: we know you don't like ads and we don't care how many you got please stop updating us we're all in this together
[1:22:47] saug_e: it's always better when streamers/creaters do the ads their own way rather then exactly the same script on every video/stream.

[4:04:18] cheekclappin_troll_grindr: @bushy_max yes it does
[4:04:19] JoshTheCarrot: is the CPAP something that you will just need to live with or will you be able to stop using at some point

[4:05:12] bushy_max: @cheekclappin_troll_grindr I've watched no pixel on I think two people, not entirely familiar with the most of it.
[4:05:16] That_monkey_guy: is it expensive?
[4:05:16] WhiteWolfAntics: @Rampetroll Over time, sleep apnea can lead to serious or even deadly complications, so early diagnosis and treatment are vital. This condition is often very treatable and there are many treatment options. The most common — and most effective — treatments, especially positive airway pressure devices, are meant for use every night.

[4:06:55] BenG_1802: @wolfxpax that’s insane ahaha
[4:06:56] PJ_Delivery_Guy: You think the better sleep gave you the motivation to move?
[4:06:59] Nightbot: @MSif7 -> Sorry my son, it had to be done. Ask permission before linking. [warning]
[4:07:00] PearCanQuest: I wonder if there is anything for people who can fall asleep easy. But also wake up easily due to minor noises?
[4:07:02] WhiteWolfAntics: @Rampetroll No problem. Glad to help. Some of my friends have it.
[4:07:03] pthekid: All the grogginess was gone?
[4:07:08] VR_NULL: instead of banning me, SB cast me like lucifer into the depths of YT chat
[4:07:16] realbigghoss: For me putting the mask on makes me go to sleep instantly
[4:07:17] djorta: happy to hear you've been feeling better
[4:07:19] Bobins: I just watched Esfand do a /carry on a dolphin 😭 Felt like a James randal move LUL
[4:07:20] jester1256hd: why my message wasdelted ?
[4:07:22] Deakula: !permit msif7
[4:07:22] Nightbot: @Deakula -> msif7 has been granted permission to post a link for 60 seconds.
[4:07:25] Bobins: Yeah haha
[4:07:30] drunkybutt: my sleep study was only 5 hours, and i felt more rested than a 9 hour normal night
[4:07:32] 1chrispbacon: a sleep study company needs to sponsor you LUL
[4:07:37] ExileSnake: Do you ever feel concern as using it as a crutch? Like you may not be able to sleep without it at some point.
[4:07:38] bushy_max: Goodbye chat and steamer. I'm going to play a game with a friend.
[4:07:38] MSif7: https://i.imgur.com/HBdKyAV.png

[4:07:49] hiperfin: before using my CPAP I would fall asleep if I was just sitting on the couch. it was harder to stay awake than it was to fall asleep.
[4:07:51] ChoobiOne: I need a machine'
[4:07:53] SpartanXxX97: does the feeling of the mask mess with you at first?
[4:07:54] ILoveFishyx: How hard is it getting tested for Apnea?
[4:07:54] pthekid: we need a ExpressCPAP sponsor
[4:07:59] ChoobiOne: I definitely have that problem
[4:08:03] Nallah17: ive had a hard time getting use to the mask, mine like leaks into my eyes
[4:08:05] Prasamaccus: I have to pee constantly at night...
[4:08:09] RitualCub1: ooo we talking About sleep satuff? i have narcalepsy it sucks

[4:08:12] rouemu: same
[4:08:17] oogabooga_22: do u ever mess up and not do the James voice when rping
[4:08:23] Ubinine: This guys NOT happy
[4:08:25] realbigghoss: Sleep Apena is also hereditary so if your parents snore they might have it and you might have it
[4:08:25] Mikomonsters: What if James birthday was today, and he just says 82 because of the leap year... that means he's almost 350 years old.
[4:08:27] Swan_luv: when my dad had his sleep study done he stopped breathing 40+ times an hour
[4:08:29] Jabberwotchi: I have sleep paralysis and started using a sleep mask (like for my eyes, to not see creepy shit) and I never take it off. You get use to sleeping with stuff on your face pretty easy if it fits
[4:08:30] crypticsteam107: why are you in prison
[4:08:32] Deakula: There's different size and style masks
[4:08:37] cheekclappin_troll_grindr: it was a play that James and the British man were doing about mutual combat, it was just acting LOL
[4:08:39] Reniora_: @Mikomonsters that'd be crazy funny
[4:08:42] DarkmoonLatte: i feel like i may have something sleep related cause i cant go to sleep very well ive tried everything i can think of without going to the doctor
[4:08:45] PearCanQuest: Is there any negatives to having a cpap if you don't have sleep apnea?
[4:08:50] SpartanXxX97: what is the mask made of? my only mask experience is gas masks
[4:08:52] NotNardwuar: breathing is good
[4:08:54] crypticsteam107: why are you in prison spaceboy
[4:08:56] pthekid: I used to have a chicken mask, not for CPAP tho, it would be for my asthma when i was younger, i hated it
[4:08:56] theonly_emmaaa: yuh
[4:09:02] realbigghoss: I think recently a MLB player died from sleep apnea complications
[4:09:03] itmecyclingfallingKarambt: we aint been evolving right
[4:09:04] 420wes69: didn't patch it out... smh...
[4:09:04] donutvampire: its getting more common as people become less active
[4:09:05] ayoforyayoooo: I have the same and I wish I had the mask
[4:09:07] dubush18: I have sleep apnea should I get a mask
[4:09:09] krab0o: the darn devs forgot about the sleep apnea bug
[4:09:09] hiperfin: @nallah17 make sure when you’re getting fitted you also test it while laying down. allow your face to completely relax.
[4:09:14] Jabberwotchi: Just mother nature trying to end us any way it can. spbKEK
[4:09:15] theonly_emmaaa: Why are you in jail
[4:09:15] MajiShine: Apparently as you get older the muscles in your neck and such just kinda get lazy and restrict breathing
[4:09:17] ahmed_judgeHD: its made of human skin
[4:09:23] Gun4hire2025: my back is defective can i file for a new one?
[4:09:24] hexavyr: what is daniel sloss yappin about in the background
[4:09:32] crypticsteam107: what did you do
[4:09:38] grave0fgod: @theonly_emmaaa hit a guy with a wrench
[4:09:39] BIGRAKofficial: my boy danny slaying it with his strong legal words HAAHAHAAHHA
[4:09:40] giggles5502: Has anyone got the new one where they insert that device so you don't have to wear a mask think it's called inspire
[4:09:44] theonly_emmaaa: o
[4:09:46] pthekid: Dick kicker 2: the dickening
[4:09:48] RitualCub1: @SpartanXxX97 kinda, its like you are forceing more air down your throat for no reason, plus sadly some cpaps technically cause cancer but they alledgedly fixed it
[4:09:50] WhiteWolfAntics: @hexavyr PogChamp Sovreign citizen
[4:10:00] FaZes: Is it something you self diagnosed?
[4:10:02] realbigghoss: Theres supposedly exercises you can do to tighten stuff up in there, they haven't worked for me but they might for some
[4:10:16] dubush18: I have sleep apnea should I get a mask
[4:10:21] Noobicus: It's something chat diagnosed
[4:10:21] TurnWest: I had issues sleeping then broke my leg and suddenly I sleep like a baby. No idea how it could be related
[4:10:28] realbigghoss: @dubush18 100%
[4:10:31] Xaipius: Loool
[4:10:33] dubush18: ok
[4:10:36] tlachtga3: i sleep well but i talk alot in my sleep and it still helped me a ton to get tested and correct bed
[4:10:36] Deakula: spbMUL
[4:10:39] RitualCub1: @Spaceboy  have you tried Xywav btw? it helps with sleeping if you have a cpap, it helps with inducing sleep
[4:10:40] Geek_Mode_Gaming: to be fair if people in twitch chat tell you that you have cancer you would ignore it too
[4:10:44] PlayerDee: I have mild sleep apnea
[4:10:44] Xaipius: WAIT
[4:10:46] GNARLONBRANDO: man youre making me want to get tested
[4:10:47] hexavyr: i wonder how comorbid sleep apnea and sleep paralysis is
[4:10:47] Xaipius: YOUR FREE
[4:10:51] crypticsteam107: why are you in prison
[4:10:56] DarkmoonLatte: i need to get tested just in case but i dont have insurance so gotta get that first
[4:10:57] Joust182: chat always knows
[4:10:57] Gun4hire2025: we know everything spbSmileboy
[4:10:59] StoneStardust: my mums been waking up with headaches for ages but it wasn’t until you started talking about headaches being a sign of sleep apnea have I been trying to convince her to go to the doctor

[4:11:12] 4rogy: I’m also trying to get my mom tested
[4:11:13] pthekid: @crypticsteam107 he got his dick kicked in, and retaliated
[4:11:15] Prasamaccus: @crypticsteam107 SOme guy kicked him in the dick and after EMS picked him up he wrenched him
[4:11:17] dubush18: Ngl James should fight the guy on top of maze bank and see who falls if first
[4:11:21] Jabberwotchi: My insurance doesnt cover a machine, they dont think breathing while asleep is essential. So I just suction to tongue to the roof of my mouth and cross my fingers I dont die in my sleep spbSmug
[4:11:22] VR_NULL: ate the knife
[4:11:27] itmecyclingfallingKarambt: BatRun
