[4:50:01] crazythings22: @deyv1d he used a 99 and 88 both did nothing
[4:50:07] 1NE8iGHTSE7EN: is there transmission and engine swap ?
[4:50:11] doktou: now the car has a 7th gear
[4:50:14] ChillTyme: it might be acceleration on certain gears
[4:50:16] Celascion: still a good 4k lick EZ
[4:50:18] rreidd: maybe just this car
[4:50:19] zvidrvhim: The mid range seems faster

[4:50:23] Spacely_Man: it hangs of 4th gear so hard
[4:50:24] anitamaxwynn0: @1NE8iGHTSE7EN yeah i think marty changed his gearbox to sequential
[4:50:26] Dreaddog2: Mr K tried with a 99 turbo and it didnt do shiz
[4:50:26] Spacely_Man: on*
[4:50:26] deyv1d: so turbos dont work on the buffalo?

[4:50:38] iZeeMo: tbh when kebun tried some there was no diff but maybe you need to speak with admins about that
[4:50:40] ihavokkx: turbos dont do much to automatics
[4:50:44] zemog_01: The stx needs a buff on top speed
[4:50:50] rreidd: acceleration is a lil better but i think it would have more effect on a manual
[4:50:56] killing4pleasure: 20k escalade quicker than this car OMEGALUL
[4:50:57] anitamaxwynn0: how much is it to change gearbox to sequential?
[4:50:59] ChillTyme: zemog_01 i think they just nerfed it
[4:51:02] SouvlakiFresh: Thats the point of a smaller turbo though.... get faster on boost but no gains after a certain rpm
[4:51:09] mortuusintus12: @kapowly spools faster on lower gears. if im not mistaken
[4:51:16] condor2104: the cop cars faster than this one
[4:51:17] doktou: @swankytiger942221 damn...i never noticed it
[4:51:19] taytoeGG: car sounds supercharged from stock as well so maybe turbo just doesn't mesh with it

[4:51:38] Celascion: handles and turns way better EZ
[4:51:40] Koltary: you need a bigger turbo then probably
[4:51:42] iZeeMo: @ihavokkx that’s cap it’s just certain cars that have this problem. auto just gets less top speed but that’s it
[4:51:47] hype__d: trans will make top speed better
[4:51:48] rreidd: true still worth the lick
[4:51:55] jamieddd: all police cars goes fast now so no point having top speed, best to lose cops in city

[7:28:13] sneakyPizzA: so fkd
[7:28:23] Originnal: ooc if you think its scuff i dont think it is because the person with the chip has to cut the power in the back so you might not see the interaction but they will
[7:28:29] Originnal: and thats what starts it
[7:28:36] Leijm: now that it is over, it was a matter of secounds.
[7:28:39] zuppiself: at the end ,its ray fault Kappa
[7:28:50] southaustin512: southaustin512 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 39 months!

[7:30:39] swankytiger942221: Because if 3 groups start it then everyone else is out of 50btc. That's just a bug then
[7:30:39] ardit7ij: 50 K loss is Huge no?
[7:30:44] xMasubu: @gateloz budda 100% reported it..it happen to him...but they should give them back the 50 BC
[7:30:57] swankytiger942221: I feel like you can do it after
[7:31:04] TheBroStud: Is someone doing the Laudromat?
[7:31:18] stocker218: Does it have a time limit till ir runs out
[7:31:18] ElDiablo1102: @gateloz they got refund no?
[7:31:19] deyv1d: next time looks like someone need to scout the landry before rush in
