[0:27:08] FantomAI: so what happens if you die in the server?
[0:27:36] tFatCat: this chase lasts an hour... he was losing it by the end
[0:28:05] mintynumber1: @fantomgx in nopixle?
[0:28:06] MaliciousDH: @tFatCat yea it didnt help that he was oblivious to air 1 being on him the entire time
[0:28:21] DeeLuxxxx: Chawa drove really well during this run.

[0:29:43] mintynumber1: @fantomgx I believe you have to wait for medics to pick you and revive you in the hospital
[0:30:00] DeeLuxxxx: @deliriousmanc1988 yeah between the number of cops responding and the shootout earlier in the run it was going to be tough for anyone to get out of that run
[0:30:37] deliriousmanc1988: he took a big risk going back for the car the second time too!  @DeeLuxxxx
[0:30:40] FantomAI: @itz_fax thx man. What about if you get arrested? Are you just banned for a certain amount of time or something?
[0:30:44] BIG_RIFF: yeah thats what frustrating about this because he drives real good for most of it but cant shake em
[0:30:50] BIG_RIFF: theres just so many
[0:31:17] TheUnholyIcon: @fantomgx you serve time in prison/holding cells
[0:31:21] MaliciousDH: @BIG_RIFF its not reallly the number of cops, it's the heli
[0:31:23] TheUnholyIcon: unless they changed it
[0:31:26] deliriousmanc1988: yes
[0:31:30] StreamElements: Check out HutchMF's YouTube at: https://youtube.com/c/HutchMF
[0:31:33] walkybalbowa: Essentially
[0:31:36] RcAdam: yeah pretty much
[0:31:38] Krvy: Haven’t seen him race yet tho
[0:31:40] Chaosmourne: theres still some good drivers but hes def one of the best again
[0:31:41] walnuts_1: He out played them at least 20 times in that one chase
[0:31:48] anthonyl3: People still use controller
[0:31:49] DeeLuxxxx: AJ was doing well keeping up with him
[0:31:49] Krvy: With the changes
[0:31:51] Midnightx_x: he hasnt placed super well in races but id say yeah
[0:31:51] walnuts_1: they just had heli and he couldn't hear or see it
[0:31:55] Naus3a: that and the speed limit seem to balance things a lot better imo
[0:31:55] deliriousmanc1988: 1 copper was oln his arse thru this though not sure who

[0:32:31] ViraneZ: they have to change controls when driving?
[0:32:34] tFatCat: @BIG_RIFF lots
[0:32:37] walnuts_1: Hunter was on his tail most of the fight but they rammed his car so he was out, summit still couldn't get away from air 1 after tho
[0:32:45] TheUnholyIcon: I believe so @fantomgx
[0:32:57] metagamer45: whats wrong with controller
[0:33:03] walnuts_1: chase not fight ^
[0:33:05] TheUnholyIcon: I don't know if your time serves while offline.
[0:33:07] deliriousmanc1988: the cop behind now does not go away
[0:33:09] hanch38: they can still use controller can't they
[0:33:10] BIG_RIFF: i wonder if thats why he can lose the cop cars so easy now then
[0:33:24] Krvy: They got shotz so heated
[0:33:42] MEGATONPUNCH82: Chawa went HAM on this chase
[0:33:42] Midnightx_x: @metagamer45 gives you a huge advantage in driving
[0:33:58] Chaosmourne: the heli needs some work its broken right now, cant be heard or seen
[0:33:58] anthonyl3: Yeah wiseguy today was like done with racing and he didn’t enjoy getting away either
[0:34:08] TheBloqz: this chase was nuts
[0:34:08] walnuts_1: @HutchMF the main problem for him was that air1 was bugged and he couldn't hear or see it
[0:34:09] sendyoadde: Dude its crazy how long this chase last
[0:34:20] sendyoadde: I was there last night and man

[0:37:39] tFatCat: the new speed helps with locals and ghost cars now @HutchMF
[0:37:46] RcAdam: the cars all getting nerfed helped with the locals
[0:37:54] desMorningStar: locals arent as bad now cause of the overall lower speeds
[0:37:56] PineapplePoutine: @NorthernGambit Yea, they dont want people to get their fix before launch
[0:37:58] deliriousmanc1988: bro he pulled out some moves too but they were just everywere
[0:38:00] Azy666: Summits driving was on point that whole chase

[0:39:51] RcAdam: heli is scuffed
[0:39:55] GGriinch: heli was scuffed
[0:39:56] deliriousmanc1988: it was glitched apparently
[0:39:56] Azy666: Chat was SCREAMING air 1 the whole time LUL
[0:39:58] BIG_RIFF: because heli got nerfed i think it just flies super high to make it easier
[0:39:59] NorthernGambit: are they so high above u cant hear it?
[0:40:03] ZachDavis95: the heli is scuffed
[0:40:05] 1cmwebstar: helis scuff out a lot now, but locals are better now
[0:40:05] walnuts_1: Someone said that it bugs out and appears on the ground with no sound even though its still in the air @HutchMF

[0:40:34] FantomAI: signature

[0:41:14] TheBloqz: it was bugged out even not bugged out its pretty op
[0:41:19] walnuts_1: they let cops have any advantage i suppose @BIG_RIFF
[0:41:22] NorthernGambit: that is so f'd LUL

[0:42:10] deliriousmanc1988: cleann
[0:42:24] deliriousmanc1988: hunter thats the 1
[0:42:25] MajinBrolyGOD: the most annoyin thing aobut the whole situation was that heli was scuffed and they had no clue it was above him and he put the moves on them so many times and they kept finding him

[3:30:33] zizman: good controller is too ez
[3:30:34] Awsomemagicmonkey: That's hilarious
[3:30:35] Prial: thanks fucking god
[3:30:35] edenscore: You can use them, they're just All on or all off, no throttling
[3:30:44] xExoGamingFTWx: @tomhughes08 hes back
[3:30:44] setting_sun: is your head sticking out of the car im dead LMAo
[3:30:47] themadnasty: I thought you could still use it, but it had binary inputs. so no throttle control and stuff like that
[3:30:47] shifra5554: Yea
[3:30:48] scouy: Controller work, but you gotta pull the sticks ALL the way for it to turn/accel etc
[3:30:48] dzemka_mj: just as AntonyZ learned how to drive with sticks from goofy
[3:30:48] AceBoogie973: Why was it cheating again? Sticks made it easier?
[3:30:49] l0udpyth0n: To me it's better on KBM

[3:30:59] Eternaldeall: grade A pit
[3:31:00] AaronTheArkitek: I thought they just made sticks the same as keyboard? Like no throttle control etc
[3:31:00] californiawaves420: bro I laughed so hard when koil did it
[3:31:05] smurFE3RINO: F'ck game abusers man
[3:31:05] MangoGioU: You can still race with controller just don't have throttle control
[3:31:09] BIG_RIFF: pitty good one
[3:31:12] Awsomemagicmonkey: Clean pit clean pit, Jaryd Peak skills still there
[3:31:17] tomhughes08: @tomhughes08 No way!
[3:31:17] mattyice1218: you can use them, but its either 0% or 100%
[3:31:26] themadnasty: time for the race scene to make a return!
[3:31:26] l_lunatix: You can still use them, they just took off the power to throttle control
[3:31:29] Kreamfire: hutch has raged multiple times lol
[3:31:30] RigsAR: @HutchMF Jackson and some others Spent 7 hours testing cars like a week and a half ago. We did every Sclass car in the City!

[3:31:32] l0udpyth0n: Glad they actually did it tho
[3:31:35] Dragons952: Good. Racing can actually be enjoyable now. The controller shit I think got Summit to quit racing for a long time.
[3:31:36] masonloll: people will always go for the best strat possible so if thats using a controller then yeah
[3:31:43] Awsomemagicmonkey: Didm

[3:32:11] iyiusashi: Lemme get into my IRacing setup for this race one sec pls
[3:32:14] Unforeseen20: You can do a lot with a controller. You can actually do most stuff.
[3:32:14] smurFE3RINO: well they choose to do it as they will have a advantage over the others that dont, which is game abuse in my eyes, not rp
[3:32:15] Awsomemagicmonkey: Didn't all these controller kids say they could do the same on MKB and it was just comfort? Why don't they just swap over since it's not an advantage
[3:32:18] Mr_Sk4z: reminds me the times of vice city, that u had to use a controller for one only mission or it would be impossible.. an RC heli...
[3:32:18] themadnasty: only thing I understand switching to controller for is helicopter. m&k is horrible for that
[3:32:26] Xanatose: yeah it wasn't fun to watch either. the camera control 9n controller sucks too so it looked unnatural
[3:32:26] dzemka_mj: @iyiusashi Trueeeee
[3:32:37] xExoGamingFTWx: yeah you can still use them, its just the throttle got changed on sticks
[3:32:53] alerioncenter: Dude, I love the snow.
[3:32:53] dzemka_mj: "Good morning how are you doing"
[3:32:57] dzemka_mj: thats what he said to you
[3:32:58] l_lunatix: Wiseguy says because the game was first built with controller that it’s fair.
[3:33:11] trichome23: nuclear fallout?
[3:33:16] dzemka_mj: "what the fuck"
[3:33:17] thecolonel78: no nintendo LUL
