[4:39:11] BladedBuzzer: WG bidness
[4:39:12] shpuddie: its also not a money printer, money printers are suppose to generate money not just collect others money KEKW
[4:39:12] Isen_Mage: it is, but all those misinformed viewers saw was "mary owns TS and stuff, mary rich" and combined them
[4:39:14] prozorftw: chatters probably thought tuner was the money printer funny enough KEKW

[4:39:33] SwebDK: Drift Queen
[4:39:41] ThePitfallover: MM was ONLY so good due to our perseverance, it didn't print money unless people actually engaged with the RP and we kept at it KEKW
[4:39:44] Rex__84: $.0 mechanics are lucky to have someone like you putting your time and effort into it to make it better for everyone

[4:40:36] Qyuyu: Why do they care about what you do, none of their business
[4:40:37] Gemcity5: The rivalry with Benson's Backalley Motors was also hilarious RP
[4:40:38] Payy_C: It wants to go to 9th gear so badly KEKW
[4:40:52] Gyfx: @Khaza_ It's not the lack of turbo is the lack of gears, if it had more gears it could reach 200+ KEKW
[4:40:53] apatetic: Mary didn't have money printers. She WAS the money printer
[4:40:53] Misui: wonder what the RPM at 8th gear is lol car's crazy
[4:40:53] jaylop94: It needs that other gearbox so badly
[4:40:54] lSoltisl: holy fuck this car NEEDS a gearbox change
[4:41:05] ralfyrich99: This car needs at least 10 gears KEKW
[4:41:08] ThePitfallover: the work we put into MM was the opposite of a money printer to me, we weren't an essential service, anyone could do what we did, we just did it better and bigger than anyone else cared to
[4:41:17] NitroC3LL: cops going in the opposite lane didn't even bother to catch up
[4:41:34] dume5330: also didn't pay the same fines as others
[4:41:41] Xergers_Lorak: the 3am money printing pepeW
[4:41:41] shpuddie: the funniest thing about people thinking youre scamming is that if you told them how much you make a day they wouldnt believe you since they expect you to be super succussful already KEKW
[4:41:44] kasilo: Mary made money because of other peoples money printers
[4:41:45] NonstopBlue: and she didn´t get caught for every dumb shit also
[4:41:45] L4zyb4ssturd: yeah lots of others tried car sales but gave up after a couple of sales
[4:41:47] jayrowzy: you also didn't lose millions to heists and charges KEKW
[4:41:47] Isen_Mage: and she never really loses the money either. Everyone else got fined and arrested a lot. Mary just evaded
[4:41:48] Morningstarter: Moneyprinters were Jeweled Dragon and Gold rush
[4:41:51] eborcurean: basically mary legally made a bank job every day

[4:42:21] Fr0stwav3: nodd dude Mary made enough profits that she funded a war and it was like a couple days profits
[4:42:28] stylzo_: its crazy and you dont get anything for it yet KEKW
[4:42:37] Vadoctrax: I wonder if KC can get refunded by the state for having put their own money into making it work.
[4:42:38] eborcurean: it took yu like 300k to get it barely working for 12 hours a day, and then 40-50k a day after that to maintain
[4:42:41] tigerland06: @kasilo Absolutely this. Mushkin's Motors made money when other people spent money.
[4:42:44] Sahneee: Speedge SPEED
[4:42:46] tedium7: tink yakuza have helped out in times of disaster
[4:43:04] Myki_Cameda: @shpuddie She also does well at putting that Image out there. the way she acts, dresses, the car she drives, the people she interacts with. She has that Aura of success
[4:43:06] lSoltisl: i mean you don't have to run it like that, you can always go back to using just rusty and let everyone else pay the price
[4:43:09] BladedBuzzer: OOF
[4:43:10] SpectreUK: I bet if you claimed some of these Mosley's cars are yours 99% of the server would believe you LUL
[4:43:13] MJ77seven: OOF
[4:43:14] itspacecowboy: As soon as you can player to player car sales, there will be 30 used car shops open up due to how much you made in 3.0
[4:43:17] eborcurean: if you paid yourself/jj/matt, it would be losing money
[4:43:30] macrotoad: basically make half a T3 group 6 run Hmm
[4:43:42] Devaleth: @itspacecowboy and 99% will fail because they will have no idea how to price, and won't be around enough to make it work
