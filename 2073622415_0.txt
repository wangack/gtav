[0:29:48] Leafyerick: Clueless
[0:29:49] freen87: the daps are still dumb. and it seems they will let their ego blind them and they will die on the hill for the daps.
[0:29:50] lawlkat: ultimately this is good. because as soon as anyone hears about it. the captains are going to seem so stupid
[0:29:50] SurelyBaked: @EsfandTV not only should daps fall off based on hours worked, officers should be given opportunities to do "community service" essentially to remove daps from their record. More RP, more police presence and it's doing your literal job

You try to pinch your butt closed but that makes your insides hurt. The poop accelerates. You call 911. The paramedics call for doctors. The doctors call for specialists. The story trends on Twitter. You turn down talk show appearances. Your septic tank fails. People form a cult. Your toilet is finished.

One of the workers falls over and can't free himself. The poop accelerates. A priest knocks over the stepladder and tackles you out the window. You land in the pile.

[7:20:50] Lucid_Jaydee: @ESFANDTV you should see if you can turn this situation into a under cover sting op
[7:20:52] blahder: I think it's 5 daps if it's fatal

[7:20:52] zilaprime: suspend me longer...no balls
[7:20:55] xdarkase: I still don't get how you got 5 daps for that bs but 1 dap for an alleged corruption charge @EsfandTV
[7:20:56] davecoia: Chat, what does the term "dap" mean in this context?
[7:20:57] splooshtasticals: smart LUL collecting more info will drive them mad

[7:21:01] jburke23: If you ask for more time off they'll definitely fire you
[7:21:02] SurelyBaked: the dap system in general is just terribly structured, from # of daps for certain things to how they fall off to not having alternative ways to remove daps
[7:21:02] Rhysing: people think less of the police for anything and everything, context never matters
[7:21:03] ens0mniac: you might ask them for time off if you get fired?

[7:21:09] zorahul: so who is reviewing you tomorrow, the people who gave you the daps?
[7:21:09] RoboticToy: Can't you just not clock in if they re hire you? @EsfandTV

[7:21:12] b_stepter: they would have to know that ooc tho which is weird to articulate tho
[7:21:12] ggminus: you will be fired if captains want to be consistent about the firings @EsfandTV
[7:21:13] deftcg: and 2 excessive forces = suspension should be per hour on the job, not per day
[7:21:14] keslo914: It CAN be used by civilians against the PD

[7:21:20] comato4st: "I want more time off"  " Ok You're fired"
[7:21:20] Snicklefritz95: Cornwood getting fired would be terrible from all perspectives imo. IC and OOC. cornwood is not a bad cop
[7:21:20] sevenevilmuffins: Some say excessive force, some say confirming a kill on a hostile entity
[7:21:22] fishnchips333: @EsfandTV though i see your point of view and the logic in it, im going to have to dap 6 for thinking it
[7:21:22] RegulatorTTV: it’s been a good RP situation to face the consequences

[7:21:24] knuuuunt: DOES ANYONE HAVE THE CLIP
[7:21:25] LemonadeSkies: can the captains change it
[7:21:25] PZ17leafs: Cornwood knows or at least is known by everyone in the city so has interactions everywhere he goes
[7:21:25] heavyd834: trouble is ruth and the other captains OOC don't factor "content" into their RP
[7:21:26] thesonofbean: I think it would be cool if Cornwood resigned until LASO
[7:21:26] re_quake: dont tell that to the RP reddit people

[7:22:10] Sprokkitt: @fishmeatx oh shi
[7:22:11] splooshtasticals: collecting data on the streets will only make corn a bigger problem. They fooked
[7:22:11] StickUpKing: Saaab mentioned banning dean since he's making 1 off characters griefing pd

[7:22:17] SierraSol: was that master chief
[7:22:17] Marsormr_: why is master chief dead
[7:22:17] outlawpickle: slacks has literally SBS'd a clown suicide game on top of a bridge, but cornwood shooting 1 bullet isnt allowed
[7:22:19] LoudPackNoReefa: yea, a punishment makes sense for RP, but 5 is a lot for situation
[7:22:19] evilmnkey4: is that master cheif?
[7:22:19] colbykab: the cops win and get to kill the guy they have been chasing all day
[7:22:20] s0ggybreads: Kinda hard for buck tho SADGE
[7:22:20] rikaus69: Master chief
[7:22:22] SinicaLRyu: esfandBless
[7:22:22] blahder: You could probably argue that he was dead before the last bullet, and because the excessive force itself didn't kill him it should only be 3 daps not 5 according sops
[7:22:22] OniZetsumei: excessive would be for being plus 2 on use of force though right ? not for the extra bullet ? he was using a deadly weapon and already attempted to kill another officer, why would you not make sure that he was down
[7:22:23] Montexes: @StickUpKing he was joking
[7:22:24] dwakndwa: I think Ssaab called for him to be banned, might want to check up on that

[7:22:43] raven1022: Saab said he wanted to ban dean after what happened to his last character so there seems to be some disagreement @esfandtv
[7:22:45] JRobezzz: @EsfandTV Do you think it's a good idea to actually tell them you want more time off? Won't they take that negatively
[7:22:46] TheKingOfWit: Siobhans' streamer called them theatrical characters. I liked the characterization

[7:23:19] SarahFlare: plus the clowns made it a game as well.
[7:23:21] LoudPackNoReefa: the extra bullet was just funny bc it was cornwood
[7:23:21] MrFuniBones: True don't get the stark contrast there
[7:23:25] SmugPls: I mean every conversation i have heard around the shooting from everyone is that you 'unloaded 2 magazines +1 into a dead guy"
[7:23:26] quaylewastaken: but then yall harassed the clowns for bs
[7:23:26] trickywaters: okay, thanks @sugecko
[7:23:27] chapszz: Did Ripely perma?

[7:23:32] TheLadyCupcake: banning dean for his 1 life character is so dumb LMAOOOOOOOOOO
[7:23:35] SurelyBaked: dude cornwood looks good in that car
[7:23:37] fishnchips333: so the difference is simply slacks attitude... noted and dapped
[7:23:38] splooshtasticals: They had to step it up unfairly cause u were an actual threat to them. Any reason to take u down
[7:23:40] NoblestSteed: Does anyone in chat remember who the other cop was that participated in the bridge clown games with Cornwood?
[7:23:40] Gr1zzz: Yeah 100% agree about they're not being hard and fast rules. I feel like that's kind of the problem right now

[7:23:46] MarvMelody: JAY ZAWN
[7:23:47] GYNECHIATRIST: PogO

[7:24:00] Fenix_TV: GTARP is kind of like whose line is it anyways where ad-libbing on the fly should be encouraged.
[7:24:00] TheKingOfWit: hard and fast rules leads to gatekeeping. we want guidelines so when things get out of hand we can use them to guide us back

[7:51:26] BdkSauce: that make no sence ,cornwood was worked up about him not talking at the meeting and now its not that bad
[7:51:27] twotgobblen1: his character is meant to be like that lmao

[7:51:31] shaddydaddyo: JOB OFFER MOSLEY'S
[7:51:31] TheDaghda: non-malicious != good for the job
[7:51:31] Allegiance86: He's acting as a barrier to PD needs which regardless of how nice of a guy he is means he's not helping
[7:51:31] sniipps: he should have his colleagues in mind not the captains
[7:51:33] iwannanuhh: he can be a good guy and not being doing what needs to be done, they arent exclusive. The PD would be better unquestionably if there was a confrontational person in that seat
[7:51:33] Pandrax86: uh oh
[7:51:33] chen094: you need to have a strong back bone to do his role

[7:51:37] Pandrax86: time to clog the toilet
[7:51:37] Gachiguru: @EsfandTV I own this house on public LULE
[7:51:37] docshaayy: he is literally plotting against the mayor telling the captains the mayor is trying to ruin the PD
[7:51:38] ggminus: i wouldnt say he is malicious, but he is incompetent
[7:51:39] bodakk: adjusting charges seems low on the totem pole of priorities though
[7:51:39] RegulatorTTV: he is a good one but I can only give bad examples lol
[7:51:42] quaylewastaken: some of the law he wrote up tagets certain ppl that does mean something

[7:51:44] SirThomasBuckets: please change to the other outfit LULW
[7:51:44] Astral_Rage: He should be employed by the state, not the PD so he isn't forced to answer to the captains and can actually do his job. @EsfandTV
[7:51:46] AkaiSky: oh no the toilet again...
[7:51:46] widbar: it sounds like Max wants someone in his camp on the council regardless of whether Nekoda is bad or not LUL
[7:51:47] anagilehippo: That’s bare minimum in his position though, no? Changing and adjusting charges isn’t really an achievement.
[7:51:47] claptil: OMEGALUL I find it so funny he lives with Xavier
[7:51:50] Jrey000: get naked
[7:51:51] ben_v_art: Hes handcuffed into being the Capt. Liaison not the PDs.
[7:51:51] Naruto_AMV_from_2007: Yoooo when did Cornwood buy a house????
[7:51:51] Crashwriter: Siobhan is awesome. Cornwood needs her tomorrow
[7:51:51] Fnlx: he's not bad, but dekoda lacks initiative
[7:51:52] polesreport: clogged toilet inc
[7:51:53] shirokuro7: He's too much of a yes man, that's def it. He needs to be more transparent with everyone.

[7:52:19] StormiNyan: poop time xdd
[7:52:20] pmoonbuddy: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
[7:52:21] Zevkk: His job is not supposed to take orders from the captains when acting as liaison, which is why he's bad at it.
[7:52:21] Chrisaroo_: After he was asked
[7:52:21] itisacar: all in all, he brought up most of the things you wanted him to

[9:33:05] KnightyGaming: esfandHappy SteerR
[9:33:06] lord_odin93: @EsfandTV Question. I'm trying to figure out my work schedule so that I can watch you play FF7 Rebirth and am wondering if there will be an early access for you and others on Wednesday since FF16 was also released a day early.
[9:33:09] Fortcats: peepoHappyShakeButClose
[9:33:10] littlescrotum12: starts kicking in 30-40 gave me old person PTSD

[9:33:33] Recon_XoX: frenn Archer
[9:33:36] ForsenOfficiaI: Clueless
[9:33:36] detergent86: small engine displacement doesn’t necessarily mean small turbo. just depends on what you wanna do. drag civics be running 110mm turbos
[9:33:37] EvilCoatrack: FF16 being early was due to people registering their PS5 in New Zealand, i thought
[9:33:39] ImmaculateSausage: try a 54
[9:33:39] ColbaeTV: EZ direct communication with the devs
[9:33:40] trevorsbigpussi: is there anyway to twin turbo? like is it even in the game?
[9:33:41] RikB55: the 54 will be good too
[9:33:45] SunnyManDS: @xxmadchapelxx Not in texas time KKona
[9:33:47] thearchonphoenix: prob need sequential for higher speeds
[9:33:48] Brakon: the other transmission might help

[9:34:06] MothyNZ: My PS5 is in New Zealand tho??
[9:34:08] 0_sh: @Biggysnipes currently a 39
[9:34:10] Wiidiis: yeah I’m surprised one size worked while others don’t, usually they all work or all don’t work
[9:34:16] Felaryn: @lord_odin93 I cleared my schedule for the release day and the next 2 days after. I'm super excited to watch Esfand play it. FF7 and FF7Remake streams were great
[9:34:23] advancedwolverine: @PsychoJoker once in a blue moon

[9:34:30] ColbaeTV: we already know the 99 doesn’t do anything
[9:34:31] harrytitsmitchell: a sanctus PogU
[9:34:31] Craxxbones: that 88 may put it in 5th gear easy though
[9:34:33] csteele2020: wait until @esfandtv sees this flop clip from talking to Brian knight

[9:34:43] Spliphos1199: Has cornwood had his review done yet?
[9:34:44] Heimdallr123: Has he gotten a confirmation on when the review is?
[9:34:55] hippiecat: stick and hold your finger out. See if it helps with the speeds. Adam found a bug with the senior buns bike. but i think it works only for manuals   https://www.twitch.tv/traumz/clip/AnimatedResilientPepperoniDBstyle-iCBAfILDRZIfklnl?filter=clips&range=7d&sort=time
[9:34:55] DefeinatelyNOTJRhymes: as an old school FiveM dev in charge of vehicles I’d love to dive into the vehicle meta files but I gave that up years ago cause of drama
[9:34:55] MrPRINCE______: looks pretty speedy
[9:34:58] justnoxid: could the turbo size be the speed it kicks in maybe?
[9:34:59] Undead_Frankie: that looks fast monkaW
[9:35:00] NFGNoFearzz: that looked like it zoomed for a sec there
[9:35:05] lord_odin93: @Felaryn Exactly. That's why I'm hoping to watch it LIVE rather than through a vod.
[9:35:05] kiwimanboi: @Twistsy fellow kiwi

[9:35:58] nantredan: @ImmaculateSausage it is if the turbo is too big for the engine

[11:41:33] TraviiiOnTwitch: pd just allows for lots of rp interactions
[11:41:33] wombat_wrangler: join civ oversight board or max's investigators
[11:41:33] NonToxicant: @sourdoughcookies no, i was talking about knowing it was a one-life character and thinking that meant it being OK to use excessive force.
[11:41:33] Vlasvilneous: If CornCould, CornWould

[11:41:44] mead98: Can Cornwood legally take actions against the pd to help take down the captains?
[11:41:46] bzerk26: Cornwood won't get a higher rank for a while after these DAPs
[11:41:47] CookiesOnDowels: it's not a complaint. if the chain of command is shite
[11:41:47] teriyeth: theres a difference between respecting the rank and respecting the person

[11:41:55] the_real_jfk: then you need to quit before they can  fire you
[11:41:55] Gigadinker: I’m new to this entire RP thing, but watching multiple streamers I found myself drawn to Cornwood. I’ve tried watching Ssaab and when I do, I feel like I’m watching him as if he’s a cop. It’s beyond RP. It’s like he’s living his life vicariously. In a bad way.
[11:41:55] chiefyief: @eilfei agreed
[11:41:55] vin_the_bin: experience outranks everything
[11:41:56] StreamElements: @esfandtv 💲 iconickreaction just donated $5.00: doesnt this prove they need cornwood lmfao
[11:41:57] slomojosh: Cornwood is for the people of the people by the people
[11:41:57] Toastbane: In military you respect the rank whether you respect the person or not

[11:42:05] Starforkx: i think cornwood outside of PD has been great RP, however i would like to see cornwood back in PD eventually
[11:42:07] Bill_Collector: Turner and slacks are going to be up your fucking ass immediately
[11:42:07] WHATtheINTERROBANG: @EsfandTV would cornwood not hold cops slightly more accountable than citizens? this type of torture and coercion is wild
[11:42:07] kalookh: mhm
[11:42:08] doggensteinn: you need to watch the Wire @esfandtv

[11:42:11] Fallarin: respect is earned
[11:42:12] nochooch: go for PD liaison on council or push hard for sherrif. I think you could justify a super skeleton crew that works closely with LSPD without all the ick of pulling people off of there, maybe 2-4
[11:42:12] sticks26: If you want a serious pd you literally need to put in place serious protocols and standards for everything. Saying it's common sense and sops isn't gonna work. EVERYTHING needs to have real world standards then
[11:42:13] millerlight44: Cornwood doesn’t have respect for chain of command because he use to be high command
[11:42:14] xblasphemye: respect is returned when loyalty is returned
[11:42:15] HeyMeghan: you’ve done a lot more good for the people while lawyering than you did in the PD.
[11:42:16] icephrogg: U cant leave the pd now it needs u the most
[11:42:17] sourdoughcookies: @NonToxicant yes thats what i was referring to and while yeah sure objectively youre right, the entire point of this server is lost on you
[11:42:17] madhatterui: use the littlemans dad for lawyer RP Kappa
[11:42:18] peonthruster: Cornwood literally causes trouble?
[11:42:18] funkie: Chain of Corn, every corn is equal
[11:42:18] SaucePotIndie: I bet nothing scares the captains worse now than you NOT being back to PD. Even if they did plan on firing you before, I bet they wouldn't now. They want you under their eye.
[11:42:19] 1manpizza: Corpa can clean up the PD from the outside
[11:42:21] iwannanuhh: The past few days have been more enjoyable to watch than the days prior to suspension. Huge props for keeping amazing content going even with a huge shift
[11:42:21] ndgvictim: @EsfandTV u goto tell slacks its integrity
[11:42:21] cdarx2: ooc info - captains are pissed right now
[11:42:22] TheGoodSpartan: Just push Sheriff
[11:42:22] ultimategamersan: also
[11:42:22] Smapdi_Flaffermann: Chat might be against the captains, but Cornwood likes em.  Except for Ruth, of course.
[11:42:23] Zolothan: the most dramatic thing would be to turn down their rehire offer
[11:42:23] jburke23: @esfandtv start a pi business with Burg and Greg
[11:42:24] driver1036: That dude should find a different lawyer though
[11:42:24] Chronatog13: DOJ Special Investigations
[11:42:24] Calonis: That is a true leader mindset
[11:42:25] C45H: Start a militia
[11:42:26] haleyheartt: honestly, cornwood seeing the pd from crims perspective has been very interesting. I think taking time away from pd might be good for him.
[11:42:26] turdburglebm: I think taking a serious break could help
[11:42:26] xJustn: i feel like cornwood is still trying to protect cops atm
[11:42:26] hellicross: when does FF7 come out?
[11:42:27] TheGodmother: I'm sry but the pd break has been awesome @esfandtv
[11:42:27] RexPappa: I think Cornwood could do more as a free agent without that much accountability. Than an officer in the current PD
[11:42:28] StickySativa: cornwood good at doing whatever he wants
[11:42:28] bathala071: Justice for the peopleJustice for the peopleJustice for the peopleJustice for the peopleJustice for the peopleJustice for the peopleJustice for the peopleJustice for the people

[11:42:35] TacoN64: Do what you like most
[11:42:35] bertacharm: i dont think thats it
[11:42:35] 99_CON_IRL: jonin again after final mfantasy, that works alot better!!!!!!
[11:42:35] Clodhoppr: for PD its militaristic, it’s required to show respect based on rank
[11:42:36] Thomefan251: Cornwood should keep being lawyer and close to mayor and get the sheriffs office open.
[11:42:37] deathroll69: fix PD from the outside.
[11:42:38] Th3Ch0: https://clips.twitch.tv/LuckyAliveKiwiDansGame-ZK8rKXxhIcPRYF_-

[11:42:42] Kalious78: Just take 2 days off from PD a week and spend that in the city if and its a very big IF your not fired and charged with murder @esfandtv
[11:42:42] disruptedorder: They said the wording on the legislation is the commissioner had to be someone who reached minimum rank of SR. Does not have to be currently a Sr
[11:42:43] Abduleon_: i miss the pd @EsfandTV Sadge
[11:42:43] the_real_jfk: you need to show these issues to max
[11:42:44] Xierany: You need to be respected for who you are, not just for your rank. That's where the issue is for Ruth and Slacks
[11:42:44] chiefboof024: EZ JUDGE HARDWOOD
[11:42:45] Darkfier: just become commissioner
[11:42:45] lowkey5arah: you’re seeing the ugly under belly
[11:42:45] widbar: You and Cornwood will not enjoy this PD LUL They made it clear that your fun harmless RP is not welcomed there. It's time to move on.
[11:42:45] gonkfan: lowkey incredible arc
[11:42:46] 1manpizza: Cornwood there for the people
[11:42:47] Zazun_: I mean the mayor is fixing things, so i think you need to be there for that.
[11:42:47] KooterNoodle: resign before getting fired @esfandtv
[11:42:47] w111iam1: Give it another week and then decide
[11:42:47] memequeen_ellie: @esfandtv cornwood needs to show this is the effect of being scared of higher ups
[11:42:48] mercs99: I would LOVE more Civ Cornwood, and I think that it would be a really interesting to see how the captains would react if they decide to rehire you and you turn it down
[11:42:48] dioni: having the option to go back would be nice
[11:42:49] NasrulAshr: I feel like taking a bit more time make sense and good RP..
[11:42:49] bazzlestag: CORNWOOD IS A AMAZEING OFFICER BUT WITH HIS VIEWS ON JUSTICE HONESTY I DUNNO I THINK HE COULD DO MORE AS A FREEAGENT TYPE THING
[11:42:50] TheGodmother: Please pd on hold Prayge

[11:42:50] MrPRINCE______: no former pd xdd
[11:42:52] nlwatcher: i like corn as a cop, but the streamer spent a lot of time being very frustrated with it and that part is not fun
[11:42:52] hellicross: i mean if you have to reapply and retrain there's no hurry
[11:42:52] Astral_Rage: It would be very easy to respect their rank if they didn't ruin the PD with daps, and don't listen to officer feedback at all. They don't respect the officers below them. It's a two way street.
[11:42:52] BeerRun204: It's your ball but, if Cornwood goes now and meets with the captains about what he was just told I think would play in favor for Cornwoods dedication to the PD
[11:42:53] icephrogg: how can u leave now u should help build it up
[11:42:53] chewymorsel: cornwood should be a civilian advocate.

[11:43:07] Bananarinno: maybe cornwood should join the investigation into the pd unit max proposed
[11:43:08] dj_rendon: (Scene) Cornwood walks in and says, "After some thinking maybe it's time... good day boys." Captains... well shit we had decided to keep you.
[11:43:08] R3d_Gum: Would be great Rp if they wanted you back and cornwood says no i need more time off

[12:07:40] Mr_Antisocial: Xavier modCheck
[12:07:42] Pee_aRe: you about to get ocean dumped
[12:07:43] xJustn: Clueless cornwood gets his job back soon
[12:07:48] Brakon: Taurus is a normal patrol car
[12:07:49] MinotaurFluff: @rachsahota1 nop
[12:07:50] KylianMfrappe: are 99 turbos bugged or something?
[12:07:55] captain_steve_420: Aldo literally repeats everything he hears to Ruth
[12:08:01] 1manpizza: modCheck Xavier
[12:08:02] PrettyKrazy: @matanzlatan2000 hes spent more time with other cops than on duty kekw
[12:08:05] Raja_Banhammer: docSmash
[12:08:06] Xen_Crypt: gear issue?
[12:08:08] calcifero7: OMEGALUL
[12:08:08] nuuskis2: are they now turbos in these!!
[12:08:09] ChainOfLightning: try something other than 99?
[12:08:09] Acebravo_nz: really
[12:08:10] Toastedgamer03: does it have a 99?
[12:08:14] M__Wolfe: What turbo in it?
[12:08:16] B33RYE: Siobhan text
[12:08:17] Acebravo_nz: strange
[12:08:17] emery_steele: it needs larger than 99
[12:08:18] HandofRag: skill issue Kappa
[12:08:18] RexPappa: I mean, you have some extra baggage

[12:08:27] GrenMTG: BONES
[12:08:28] wastington: 3 ppl in the car rn

[12:08:39] evilmnkey4: press f lol jk
[12:08:40] slomojosh: took a while to hit 4th
[12:08:41] Lyssafofissa: @mcbeezy I think if Siobhan had put more emphasis on the lettering of the law saying “CRIMINAL possession of PD weapon”, they might’ve had a chance. Cops couldn’t prove K WASNT planted w a gun bc of the lack of investigation
[12:08:42] kickmaster11: Did he need to park it?
[12:08:42] calcifero7: texts
[12:08:45] ZekeZOZ: hmm

[12:08:53] Toastbane: Try a 99 with sequential maybe
[12:08:57] gatsymphony00: Tauras makes a huge diff with people from what ive seen
[12:09:02] Zazun_: Acceleration might be like at a "10" already @EsfandTV
[12:09:06] LoneSoldier021: the more people in the car the slower it will perform no?
[12:09:06] carefreespreee: @EternalCoconut jumps give speed boost
[12:09:08] BigglesVII: Need a lower turbo
[12:09:09] Acebravo_nz: @esfandtv does the weight of how many people in the vehicle effect at all or is it not applicable?
[12:09:12] m3lenny: @EternalCoconut my guess is curb boosting.
[12:09:18] VincentsDeath: how is this with just 1 person vs 3
[12:09:21] ColbaeTV: o7 Xavier
[12:09:22] counttolstoy: People wants a chase SAJ
[12:09:22] No_bull_shet: @Lyssafofissa thats not how an affirmative defense works but good try
[12:09:24] KylianMfrappe: is there a turbo in your car because if there was there won't be for long
[12:09:24] Shmoopee: probably affects acceleration
[12:09:25] EternalCoconut: @carefreespreee Yeah, I know about curb boosting but someone said they "fixed" it. I guess not
[12:09:26] Kohilenn: Ruth xdd
[12:09:27] visidious_moz: Turbo shouldnt really impact top speed that much?
[12:09:28] Teckinn: Ruth

[12:09:45] Shmoopee: Try a smaller turbo?
[12:09:45] SumDee_LumDee: ModCheck Xavier?
[12:09:45] fishnchips333: @Lyssafofissa they would have just hit her with anyone who isnt an on duty cop with a pd gun is criminally in possesion
[12:09:46] OphidianFX: 110
[12:09:47] paladinroguemagewarrior: badass car

[12:10:32] Joongi_: @bigchillindylanx He got suspended for SBSing
[12:10:34] Lyssafofissa: @no_bull_shet in real life a proper investigation would have to eliminate the possibility but they didn’t do that. then again it’s not law in the city
[12:10:36] matanzlatan2000: @bigchillindylanx got suspended despite not doing anything wrong.

[12:11:28] sshineysean: why would it drive faster in the city than on the freeway?
[12:11:31] Vangard__: I think cornwood would want to personally own the turbos and lend them to the PD, and if he is reimbursed he will no longer own them
[12:11:33] GYNECHIATRIST: WICKED 󠀀
[12:11:38] Dicond: does he have keys?

[13:23:40] korgx15: commissioner?
[13:23:41] ColbaeTV: being a super majority dictates weather or not the federal gov can repeal it themselves  or not
[13:23:41] TacticalTangent: The biggest face palm thing was that the mayor wants to have a commissioner to have oversight and keep the captains accountable, Ruth goes and suggests that one of the Captains should be the commissioner.

I watch Ssaab and he's the kindest streamer but his chat has a lot of toxic chat hoppers. Ppl just need a life basically and elarn to chill. It'll be fine.
[13:25:22] xnightshift2658: @MDM4ever1986HD It says the state picks the commissioner and that person does not answer to him
[13:25:24] matanzlatan2000: GIGACHAD MAYOR
