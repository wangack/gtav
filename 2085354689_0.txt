[0:08:36] spazzles: Hell Yeah!  just remember that if she had a bad infection, then excess sleep will be a natural and normal part of the recovery process.  but also moving around like that is aces, that's exactly what you want to see in a recovering cat
[0:08:59] doc_sharon: in case Wally is back to his "punch Maxx" arc again during chapter KEKW

[0:09:56] NoharTheShark: my friend has sworn that her almost 20 year old cat is going to die every day for the last three years...but it just keeps going
[0:10:10] AshuraX13: katesHm
[0:10:14] Nightbot: Follow Kate on Instagram! instagram.com/kate.ttv
[0:10:17] brainbosh: If you have had a bruise that shape changes too, right?
[0:10:25] Symbiotic1: probably fluid filled
[0:10:27] Insaif: Skin can stretch and fluids can move around. The same thing can happen with things like pimples even.
[0:10:27] fattydelrey: accesses can tunnel
[0:10:28] doc_sharon: if it is flatter and less tender, that is a good sign Yesyes
[0:10:28] Siirika: Most likely just the infection ''dying'' down, so it's not like bulging as much?
[0:10:29] Kthanid: could be a combination of the pus bcoming more fluid and spreading out and reabosrbing, and abscesses also tunnel a bit.
[0:10:29] spazzles: subcutaneous infections will move about.  not ideal, but not abnormal.  broad spectrum antibiotics like amoxicillin will take care of it just the same
[0:10:43] fattydelrey: you dont wanna know i almost died from one
[0:10:47] if0rg0t2remember: if it is fluid filled it probably spreads as the body breaks it down and absorbs it
[0:10:51] Kthanid: the bacteria just kinda creates a channel.
[0:11:05] doc_sharon: it's not a tunneling abscess, cause she would be much worse if it was
[0:11:05] GenuineMind: DONT WORRY THE STRMMR
[0:11:10] tachyondecay: We are rooting for Loaf katesHypers
[0:11:11] Insaif: katesMega SHE'S GONNA BE FINE. IT'S NO BIG DEAL.
[0:11:19] Kthanid: does it seem wider but shallower?
[0:11:22] pickleviiiic: LOAF IS INDESTRUCTIBLE!
[0:11:25] Insaif: katesL
[0:11:29] AshuraX13: She's a tough gal katesHug
[0:11:33] doc_sharon: that's a good thing NODDERS
[0:11:38] Insaif: Then it's likely healing and reabsorbing.
[0:11:42] LilMaGooby: It's the white blood cells fighting back, the shape can change, as long as she's getting better it should go away
[0:11:42] doc_sharon: it is
[0:11:48] Kthanid: fluid likely breaking up and being less cohesive.
[0:11:52] spazzles: what antibiotic did you get for her?
[0:11:53] MyNameisTiff_: It's definitely a good thing. It's breaking up.
[0:11:57] doc_sharon: if it was getting worse, it would be coming to a head
[0:12:06] brainbosh: The skin has many layers, and the fluid is just expanding but not growing, similar to a blister
[0:12:12] Kthanid: think going from toothpaste consistency to something more milky
[0:12:21] spazzles: yeah the injected one will be different from the oral one, I'm just curious
[0:12:28] Insaif: I bet she'll be eating by tomorrow at the latest and back to (mostly) normal in a couple of days as long as you can keep the antibiotics up.
[0:12:29] LilMaGooby: If her body weren't successfully fighting it off she would be struggling more
[0:12:44] fattydelrey: ^
[0:12:44] Nightbot: ^
[0:12:45] doc_sharon: you gotta do what you gotta do Yesyes
[0:12:56] Pleasantmsp: That's what we had to do with my dog for his medicine. They don't like it but they need it
[0:13:00] spazzles: that's how you treat a cat that won't eat
[0:13:10] Insaif: !song
[0:13:11] Saydiejayne: yes
[0:13:11] Kthanid: It's probably ampicillin or amoxicillin, they're very common anti-biotics.
[0:13:13] Nightbot: Daft Punk - Too Long https://open.spotify.com/track/3zMvotMEQK3xvH01vA9wAP
[0:13:13] tachyondecay: Yeah, giving medicine to a cat is like the worst
[0:13:18] fattydelrey: yeah the throw it down thier throat close the mouth and pray
[0:13:25] spazzles: thankfully my Zeus never stopped eating, so I'm always able to get her meds into her
[0:13:27] Insaif: Guess she had to help.
[0:13:29] GriltCheesr: Yeah, not super fun pilling a kitty, but eventually they get less squirmy
[0:13:32] doc_sharon: oop
[0:13:37] AntiochChouteau: It usually works better to shoot it at the corner of their mouth.
[0:13:42] 4taog: I've been giving a guinea pig pain killers by syringe for 2 years and she doesn't like it either.

[2:05:30] doc_sharon: I love it katesL
[2:05:32] IchibaToll: Maybe someday Tom works his way back similarly.  He's got a longer way to go though.
[2:05:32] AshuraX13: It's so darn cute
[2:05:33] Kthanid: Patched members are the backbone of the club.
[2:05:43] jedi_raccoon: Trader Joe‚Äôs has these Pizza Chips, they‚Äôre not bad
[2:05:46] A_Humble_Wooper: Good to have some sturdy reliable non-titled members. Sets an example for the others.
[2:05:49] ThomasTheDestroyer: I feel like he took that L with the RC stuff to heart and really is just trying to do good by the club.
[2:05:52] doc_sharon: And he cheers Maxx on, like in the sewers katesAw
[2:05:59] lorddracnor: It also gives a sense of difference between patch and prospect
[2:06:20] AshuraX13: MaxxFire
[2:06:22] lorddracnor: because every other patch has some kind of roll
[2:06:24] KarnEvil: yuh.  mason's been great recently.
[2:06:37] tyrelrahl: Imo it also shows a full willingness to accept her in that position.
[2:06:42] doc_sharon: good, strong patch members are the foundation for the club Yesyes and he is that
[2:06:45] NoharTheShark: mason has put in the work on his own but tom's issues have really made it apparent by comparison
[2:07:06] A_Humble_Wooper: Shows no hard feelings, too.
[2:07:23] Renoxius: its awesome that Mason's stepping up as a patch as well because whoever joins the club later will have a very good example to follow
[2:07:35] hecktobreakfast: MaxxRoll SmokeTime
[2:07:44] doc_sharon: I love it cause everyone gets to see/hear it - it's public support
[2:08:00] A_Humble_Wooper: NODDERS

[2:08:12] Hoocairz: Yesss
[2:08:17] Pleasantmsp: NODDERS
[2:08:31] Kthanid: Also if Mason can recover from where he was, I do believe Tom can climb back up, with a LOT of hard, humble work.
[2:08:37] hecktobreakfast: NODDERS
[2:09:09] A_Humble_Wooper: Oh yeah, the Raiders are a mess, but they're aware and working on it.
[2:09:11] tyrelrahl: If the higher members are functioning it also shows different paths prospects can take
[2:09:12] Insaif: There's still room for growth, but the base is strong.
[2:09:14] jedi_raccoon: also for snacks, Dollar Tree has Harvest Snaps Wasabi Baked Green Pea Snaps Wasabi flavored
[2:09:21] Kthanid: Maybe not babbo crims anymore but pre-K (joking)

[2:24:50] Irish_GT: Fuck I should have ended stream sooner and got in here
[2:24:53] GenuineMind: I would laugh if a mod was watching and changed the weather at that moment
[2:25:04] Irish_GT: What did tom do irishg37Sus
[2:25:16] if0rg0t2remember: LETHERCOOK
[2:25:18] jedi_raccoon: I‚Äôll be watching the vod from earlier tomorrow at work, I already started and saw an axe welder save Maxx earlier
[2:25:19] Hoocairz: @irish_gt fucked around....
[2:25:21] UppyFF: thought with his pee pee
[2:25:22] Carbonfated: almost feels like Norman Bones was watching katesGiggle
[2:25:24] kay_bs0919: more like who didn‚Äôt Tom TRY to DO
[2:25:24] itGlenn: FAFO
[2:25:28] Kthanid: LITERALLY fucked around.
[2:25:29] Irish_GT: I'll wait
[2:25:30] slackerdee: tldr: tom fucked around, literally, and he found out
[2:25:31] sharingiskaren: literally FAFO
[2:25:31] A_Humble_Wooper: @Irish_GT Lane summarized it very well in her verbal thrashing she just gave Tom.
[2:25:32] doc_sharon: Clap rule passes
[2:25:42] kangg: new rule katesHypers
[2:25:45] NoodleCubed: Lane not voting katesJuice
[2:25:52] A_Humble_Wooper: Yeah, fair. :D
[2:26:04] Irish_GT: I just clicked on the stream as she said he could leave
[2:26:07] AlliLovesGiraffes: Tom slept with a hangie to be
[2:26:08] doc_sharon: PepeMoney
[2:26:17] IchibaToll: Irish - had a crush on Maxx, didn't tell her, told the rest of the club except high command; then the day after all this came out, he slept with someone else who had gotten nominated for hangaround the day before.
[2:26:18] kangg: hell yeah PepeMoney
[2:26:36] jedi_raccoon: yeah HC is only a tie breaker
[2:26:39] hecktobreakfast: DAMN
[2:26:46] doc_sharon: let's gooooo!
[2:26:50] doc_sharon: HELL YEAH Hypee
[2:26:53] KarnEvil: not bad schmoney for a small club.
[2:26:58] Irish_GT: @IchibaToll Ain't no fucking way
[2:27:03] doc_sharon: Club is doing WORK
[2:27:09] Insaif: @Irish_GT Oh, you have no idea.
[2:27:15] doc_sharon: Irish add in some bad attitude as well KEKW
[2:27:17] Kthanid: @Irish_GT And Maxx was THE LAST person to find out about the crush.
[2:27:21] sharingiskaren: along with attitude and lies etc
[2:27:25] A_Humble_Wooper: Plus when Maxx talked to Tom about it, he promised to rebuild her trust with his actions, because he knew his words didn't mean much to her.
[2:27:32] Irish_GT: How could Irish do this
[2:27:37] iamsickntwisted: Not entirely accurate. He slept with her the day before she was nominated but he knew the entire week that they wanted her for a hangy before he ever got close to sleeping with her and did it anyway. Then continued to do so after hangy nom
[2:27:37] GenuineMind: Is this basically what's left of the Raiders?
[2:27:40] doc_sharon: katesGiggles
[2:27:47] if0rg0t2remember: @Irish_GT he got fined 10k and dismissed from Chapter. The Hangaround got dropped
[2:27:53] hecktobreakfast: @Irish_GT When we said he literally fucked around, yeah. So now he's finding out. Also Lane is terrifying when she wants to be. How could Sean do this??
[2:28:04] A_Humble_Wooper: The night of the day he promised to rebuild Maxx's trust, was the first night he slept with Tate.
[2:28:10] Insaif: katesBusiness
[2:28:12] sharingiskaren: he‚Äôs still a prospect
[2:28:13] doc_sharon: he fucked around.  With his penis.  katesSmile
[2:28:20] jedi_raccoon: Do you think Raiders better than BBMC in 3.0?
[2:28:34] Kthanid: @jedi_raccoon apples and oranges.
[2:28:37] doc_sharon: that's fair NODDERS
[2:28:48] hecktobreakfast: @doc_sharon katesNoted
[2:28:51] KarnEvil: apples and oranges.  both are good in their own right.
[2:28:52] jedi_raccoon: ahh just a random question
[2:28:57] ThomasTheDestroyer: Technically Tom slept with Tate the day before Tate was nominated for hang-around. Tom had plenty of opportunity to say something before and during the meeting where she was nominated to be a hangy. Tom said nothing until well after she was an official hangy.
[2:28:59] Dongolev: Define "better"
[2:29:00] GenuineMind: katesNoted katesNoted katesNoted
[2:29:10] NoodleCubed: they are better at being raiders, worse at being bbmc
[2:29:13] doc_sharon: yeah the club can make that money with their current work Yesyes
[2:29:16] Insaif: You did miss 4 days this week. Makes sense.
[2:29:18] UppyFF: Tom doesn‚Äôt have a voice at chapter @thomasthedestroyer
[2:29:32] sharingiskaren: @noodlecubed lol
[2:29:35] A_Humble_Wooper: @ThomasTheDestroyer plus he kept sleeping with her AFTER she got accepted as a hangie.
[2:29:43] FunkFoo: @jedi_raccoon NOPE!! There is no Collin and Nancy.
[2:29:46] UppyFF: yeah that‚Äôs the bad part pearbrSuffer
[2:29:50] doc_sharon: also there were lots of cops in Sandy
[2:29:57] jedi_raccoon: it‚Äôs the only other MC I‚Äôve watched
[2:30:12] ThomasTheDestroyer: Lane directly told him that he could have said something before or during. Whether he has a voice or not, officially, Lane said he should have said something.
[2:30:13] IchibaToll: Or even after
[2:30:14] AshuraX13: Or even right after
[2:30:22] jedi_raccoon: aww No Collin or Nancy
[2:30:23] Nightbot: Follow Kate on Instagram! instagram.com/kate.ttv
[2:30:25] doc_sharon: yeah it's just during the meeting they do not talk.  To keep meeting order Yesyes
[2:30:39] doc_sharon: can we try a different turf katesHm
[2:30:55] jedi_raccoon: but they had a Barry
[2:31:02] Insaif: It's also hard to push when you're the only one around, right?
[2:31:19] doc_sharon: katesHm
[2:31:35] kangg: Sandy was picked because of a potential relationship with the lost which has kinda fizzled out
[2:31:37] doc_sharon: and more of them around can help NODDERS
[2:31:44] abblepiewit: NODDERS
[2:31:47] lorddracnor: Yeah
[2:32:01] Insaif: NODDERS That feels like a better move. Plus then you don't have to worry about the issue with the Sandy locals, either.
[2:32:08] jedi_raccoon: I love Lade and Wane
[2:32:24] doc_sharon: Yesyes they are
[2:32:25] Pleasantmsp: NODDERS
[2:32:30] lorddracnor: This sounds like a solid plan
[2:32:33] MyNameisTiff_: NODDERS
[2:32:36] laxwall11: We would have another group helping with lost not helping at all.
[2:32:45] lorddracnor: It's not like the "turf" matters because Raider's turf is Chumash
[2:33:32] Insaif: And Kermy was pretty chill on the hunting trip. katesHug

[2:33:57] Carbonfated: @Insaif chillin on the ground
[2:34:02] hecktobreakfast: @Insaif when we weren't dying or on a trip to or from hospital.
[2:34:02] A_Humble_Wooper: @Insaif yep, it also means more getting to hang with and mess with Kermy. katesGiggle
[2:34:04] kangg: lucky for mason he got felony possession twice only lol
[2:34:05] laxwall11: Nothing wrong with shifting gears
[2:34:20] doc_sharon: yeah he said we would push their strain
[2:34:26] laxwall11: It's their strain
[2:34:54] doc_sharon: gotcha NODDERS
[2:35:26] A_Humble_Wooper: NODDERS
[2:35:28] Insaif: Also gives the notHOA a break so they don't get burnt out trying to keep the rep up.
[2:35:28] doc_sharon: thats what I like - we don't lose our strain Yesyes
[2:35:32] kangg: pushing in Paleto means one thing‚Ä¶NEW OUTFIT katesHypers katesHypers katesHypers katesHypers
[2:35:44] lorddracnor: The only downside would be the possible "progression" and as I type this, Lane is explaining it better

[3:18:09] A_Humble_Wooper: @lorddracnor I think your best bet would be to think what specifics you'd want in an ideal piece, pick an artist you think would be good, and ask them for an estimate.
