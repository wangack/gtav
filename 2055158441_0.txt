[4:32:13] Citekare: geegaNODDERS
[4:32:23] FelysLefaye: @Ryuko95 damn you bricked up
[4:32:24] KumiXIV: isnt 5% for cleaning low too $250 for a run seems so little
[4:32:26] whykillbob: cleanjj
[4:32:27] Jrunnah: Time for a Stand UP Meeting
[4:32:35] kylo_jennings: I thought weed push was 55% and crew gets 25%
[4:32:38] RJXZY: toonyHmm
[4:32:45] DragonDivide: grepEatsoup
[4:32:52] colonelsanders460: thank god Gigi is with the bois
[4:32:53] NickPenrhyn: Adjusting the rates was the idea anyways geegaNODDERS
[4:32:56] kylo_jennings: and that was different from chop/theft/ac
[4:32:59] colonelsanders460: they would be so lost
[4:33:12] jshwan: isnt push 55%?
[4:33:24] couchtyp: Susge stolen, eh?
[4:33:28] Sovereign_Doom: heyy @colonelsanders460
[4:33:28] MooseMail: geegaGoon She just knows managing
[4:33:29] Jrunnah: honestly I LOVE the commitment.
[4:34:48] martymagoo78: are you doing this based on profit, or sales value?
[4:34:49] kylo_jennings: I thought it was 55% push 5% clean 25% crew but it was only for weed
[4:35:00] kingkoolkattz: KEKWWA Stanley
[4:35:04] kylo_jennings: and chop/theft/ac stays the same or wasn’t discussed
[4:35:12] colonelsanders460: @Sovereign_Doom, toonyHi
[4:35:12] KnifeStamp: ALOO PHONE GUY
[4:35:16] timmeh_aus: so basically tony and goof are getting 5% cash back since they are the only cleaners
[4:35:17] CanWarfare: I guess cleaning and vu at 5% - why would they want to have that be a job for someone?
[4:35:18] IMightHavePie: IMightHavePie subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! 
[4:35:26] Quacced: Quick, chat, call Gloryon
[4:35:55] kylo_jennings: cleaning at 5 kinda rough
[4:36:01] martymagoo78: i feel like growing should only be 10% as they get 10% of allll weed, whereas the sales are split through multiple people and it takes longer
[4:36:17] jupiterhb: NOTED
[4:36:20] MooseMail: geegaGoon the flow chart
[4:36:29] jem_lucinamain: BorisClean
[4:36:32] Roquinio: this flow chart need a man standing to assert dominance
[4:36:50] CanWarfare: I guess I'm saying the 5% hit from the full amount can just be handed to the VU vs. the cleaning job.  The Don's are losing the same amount from the total either way
[4:36:54] FrostedGlas: NOTED money... up...
[4:36:56] JessCee7: Growers actually make a lot with 2h of work
[4:37:01] martymagoo78: are you including the costs to make the weed in this or just from sales?
[4:37:03] DragonDivide: geegaBased
[4:37:04] kylo_jennings: I thought it was 5 for weed and 10 still got chop/ac/theft but didn’t know chop got bumped to 55
[4:37:42] Sovereign_Doom: 100k being 20 cleaning jobs and only making 5 grand off of it seems kinda meh
[4:37:45] kylo_jennings: vu gives u washed cash still gotta turn in money orders
[4:37:47] genghiskonrad: If you want to encourage people to fence/pawn you could pull 5% from theft since its assumed that whoevers doing it will be encouraged to do both as intended
[4:37:48] MooseMail: Chat, trust. She just knows business geegaGoon
[4:37:57] Saul_Goode: are the VU% cut based per tsunami/in-game day?
[4:38:08] kylo_jennings: the cleaning I think means turning the washed money to money orders
[4:38:11] Hades_bz: yeep
[4:38:17] Roquinio: do the boys give you time consuming per job?
[4:38:19] Roe_the_Second: the bois doing the cleaning is a guaranteed 5% compared to the VU being variable
[4:38:32] suebae: I don't think it's supposed to be a main source of income
[4:38:45] defxoul: maybe more money - less % she takes?
[4:38:48] martymagoo78: so the crew actually gets less than 25% as they cover the weed cost?
[4:38:49] KumiXIV: could maybe get an hourly rate per job so you can adjust the percentages to be more fair like cleaning atm is $750 per hourish
[4:38:50] im_mae_: remember guys, crime doesnt pay
[4:38:57] timmeh_aus: the chopping and the AC parts are alot of money, especially the AC parts
[4:39:04] Roe_the_Second: no the real question is gege going to become a ghost again?
[4:39:11] xCrosschance: G6 Ranger on duty!
[4:39:21] BreakFlame6T: "If you enjoy what you do, that's all that counts!" :)
[4:39:37] kayneechan: Basically it's less fun doing civ jobs but it's worth it, it's more fun doing crim jobs but not worth it.
[4:39:37] CanWarfare: love the pipeline flow ....no one else is doing this it feels like
[4:39:38] Gastaftorz: any thoughts on if payouts will be possible this week post house purchase?
[4:39:58] Jrunnah: geegaSalute geegaSalute  Part of the Crew, Part of the Resources
[4:40:04] QuackstheRubberDuck: in 3.0 weed was the entry and was shit money compared to meth
[4:40:05] Saul_Goode: have they discussed a 2nd turf for pushing?
[4:40:05] Roe_the_Second: now I know it was brought up where was your cut for doing this coming out of?
[4:40:13] NorthWestDork: Hopefully itll pay off when the crew starts robbing banks $50k-100k at a time
[4:40:17] anyasweetie: Hii hii geegaHappy DinoDance
[4:40:18] Hades_bz: imagine everyone was doing civ job and crew gets 30% of that, crew would be making bank KEKW
[4:40:32] martymagoo78: end of the day these values are a first try… they can be tweaked over time
[4:40:33] Jrunnah: Gigi about to Flip the Economy on it's head
[4:40:41] Sovereign_Doom: i mean harry did some math and he said with just what he grew yesterday he would be getting like 18k off his day of growing which seems pretty good for something so passive
[4:40:47] KumiXIV: keep it percentage but maybe getting an hourly wage to adjust the percentages around
[4:41:04] Sovereign_Doom: or maybe that was over the last couple days
[4:41:19] Saul_Goode: speedy pushing 8hrs only to make 5k T_T
[4:41:29] DragonDivide: geegaBased
[4:41:40] UnalloyedJoy: UnalloyedJoy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! 
[4:41:49] martymagoo78: i would also be tempted to pay pushers who arent paid into the crew more, as they arent getting the benefit for the crew fund and you need to keep them motivated
[4:41:58] ParappaTheNappa: not trying to meta-game too hard
[4:42:08] Jrunnah: It's the quick nickle vs the Slow Dine
[4:42:11] Jrunnah: Dime
[4:42:12] colonelsanders460: I died laughing when Lang told Gigi about his history with accountants lol
[4:42:13] terceroblue: stepping stones
[4:42:14] JessCee7: Prob have to balance crime/legal jobs
[4:42:22] 1994fordexploder: that's the vibe I got from watching speedy's streams
[4:42:27] Shio_Vo: Just like Jaywalk is the gateway to terrorism
[4:42:27] timmeh_aus: im pretty sure octo just cleaned 30-40k today alone
[4:42:29] Saul_Goode: @colonelsanders460 when did that happen? lol
[4:42:57] colonelsanders460: @Saul_Goode, yesterday I believe
[4:43:10] louis_aguilar: FBI having a field day listening to this haha
[4:43:18] Gastaftorz: I hope Quaaludes become a thing just for the funny
[4:43:19] Jrunnah: For legal reasons, she means *In Minecraft*
[4:43:25] Saul_Goode: @colonelsanders460 Thanks! is it on stream or no VoD? xD
[4:43:48] leshnator: KEKW
[4:43:53] A_SAMSQUANCH: KEKWWA
[4:43:55] colonelsanders460: @Saul_Goode, i was watching from Langs POV
[4:44:12] JessCee7: Did the meeting happen ?
[4:44:12] pimpster978: Trial and error
[4:44:12] Saul_Goode: Ty I will look it up
[4:44:21] dawnyaaan: they got ketamine in gta? pushin horse tranqs
[4:44:23] randomsama613: STOP NON-ADDICTIVE, NON-NARCOTIC
[4:44:32] Ryuko95: STOP EVER DID GRIME ON A QUAALUDE?!
[4:44:33] colonelsanders460: @dawnyaaan, they had it in 3.0
[4:44:38] jupiterhb: Thats what the corn and groceries tags are for slayyy
