[10:25:46] rlloyd17: Yeah, just hit those tw0
[10:25:47] tally_one: I feel Ziggy on that, if the charge doesn’t stick in a case like this, it couldn’t stick in many others

[10:27:17] Naixoram: they just closed their eyes when putting it in the trunk 4HEad
[10:27:18] RyeZ33: what's the charge for poaching?
[10:27:21] xacktastic: it could go either way for sure
[10:27:36] The2b: it sounds like ziggy is just trying to get a case law for it so you know how to charge it in the future, no?
[10:27:38] PolarShip: I think he's just doing that so the charges are more defined. Just like how the oxy charges got changed
[10:27:40] BilboBuckins: NODDERS I agree with just stiff-arming Reggie

[10:28:03] rlloyd17: Yeah, that makes sense. Those 2 were poaching for sure.

[10:31:58] wondervviener: it will be intersting case nonetheless, might even relate to other charges

[10:32:14] jc_e1x: I think when you get to a senior level then it makes sense to charge people in an attempt to create case law.
[10:32:28] AnterO88: more like ziggys going to jugde so next time reggie wont fight this
[10:32:29] Ownager: DOJ would rather they get cases instead of getting none so...
[10:32:30] administratr: You need to power game like Lenny Kappa
[10:32:35] Zillxia: I have a feeling that Ziggy wants to push this to test the wording of the law not because he wants the 4 convictions

[10:35:05] LozZA_M: I thought the court case was so you could set precedent?
[10:35:18] neutrofuji: @uberhaxornova The Judge's say they probably won't chang the law unless there's a court case about it.
[10:35:19] LozZA_M: or does it not work like that?
[10:35:23] changedmynameto: But if he can get a judge to say it in court you can refer to it as precedent

[10:38:09] jedimindtricks82k: @ownager true
[10:38:13] french_spies: then take that concern to the DOJ. If you seriously can't go off of a judge's official word, the DOJ needs reform.
[10:38:19] Ownager: That's why Coyote's stance of "what's in the box" wouldn't hold up in actual court LUL
[10:38:21] SirBellum3rd: I see what your saying

[10:46:06] SVPV: @DarthCheesus no, it just means the questioning on scene isnt usable I think
[10:46:21] PoisonTea: Reggie doesn't give a shit about the PD don't take it personally. He an Asshole lawyer.
[10:46:21] changedmynameto: They can just plead 5th

[10:46:27] french_spies: nini did say she still didn't understand after the third time. I think what you're supposed to do is ask what part they don't understand
[10:46:28] wondervviener: Reggie with the Realistic Lawyer RP KEKW

[10:46:41] YewFancy: He’s a lawyer lol I wouldn’t want my lawyer “throwing bones”
[10:46:47] skuts: You don't need any of the information given by Nini anyway, the evidence speaks for itself
[10:46:49] conves: i confused. you are informing them of their rights. They have the rights. you dont give them to them. So what is there to accept
[10:46:51] kingofthebeats: @wondervviener that's not realistic KEKW, argue things like that is pointless
[10:46:51] wutangstyle613: Ahh the classic i have no defense so ill make one up, maneuver
[10:46:51] PyroGh0st: Isn’t he the same lawyer that argued city time vs local time @uberhaxornova

[10:47:23] Luroloro: Coyote of lawyers
[10:47:24] yeomans11: He latches onto anything that can swing things in his favour. In that sense he's good, but it is a summy tactic

[10:47:30] EuphoriaEffect: will do
[10:47:34] Riuzaku: @acterious, you are probably forced to bring them to the PD and call a lawyer if someone plays fully dumb to the rights reading. I don't see what else you can do, which is suffering pepeW
[10:47:37] muunen: really depends on the judge when it comes to that guy
[10:47:39] Toulboks: What happen if the police says the right was read and the suspect said he didn't?
[10:47:40] changedmynameto: He's a good defence lawyer but lying is against ethics
[10:47:42] Glancing: What if you catch someone mid crime, but they don't speak english, and you don't speak their language and have no one available to read their rights? Just have to let them go? KEKW
[10:47:48] sutanhazz: how's the RP so far?
[10:47:49] MonsterATX: Always go with what's provable, if anything, the report has the names of the suspected accomplices. Right?

[10:48:37] muunen: he shouldve just let kitty say it was her so you wouldnt have to go through all this
[10:48:45] DarthCheesus: @SVPV So they can just lie the 2nd time around?
[10:48:47] MetaThw: I wish cases where a little less rp, so it wouldn't take hours
[10:48:49] samuelg06: if it was fun until yall got to the station
[10:48:52] Glancing: mans really went from "what if they were turned the other way" to "you read her rights 3 times but she didnt understand them, thats a big issue"
