[6:03:49] DukeOfGlouchester: Neeel
[6:03:51] RadicalLynx: haha
[6:04:11] RadicalLynx: Sips is Chris
[6:04:21] Celestronach: rythians irl name is super cool. his last name is HELLSTRAND. metal af.
[6:04:33] RadicalLynx: RIGHT????
[6:04:46] RadicalLynx: it actually lowkey pisses me off he doesn't use hellstrand as a username lol
[6:04:47] DukeOfGlouchester: I think only knowing someone by a gamertag has a sort of je ne sais quoi
[6:06:18] SockOnYourChowd: the next thing you say, Lydia's irl name is not Big (first name), Lyds (last name) tsk tsk
[6:06:37] Celestronach: lmaoo
[6:06:55] RadicalLynx: nah, it's Squid Lyds
[6:07:04] RadicalLynx: Big is just a nickname

[7:56:32] RadicalLynx: like, why haven't they changed if it's still an issue lol
[7:57:07] midnight_aurelius: I suppose it's about what other options they have Sadge
[7:57:29] drakegard: wasn't it some rando claiming to be epidemic and doing copyright claims?

[7:57:42] fedex7720: Surely there is alot more options out there?
[7:58:18] RadicalLynx: @drakegard this year or back then?
[7:58:29] midnight_aurelius: I don't know enough about it, but seeing as JJ is a multimillion pound/dollar charity I'm sure it's more complex than we expect yogHands
[7:58:56] drakegard: back then
[7:59:19] midnight_aurelius: Back then it was still multimillion fefeasmrBark
[7:59:31] RadicalLynx: haven't dealt with YT copyright claims, but I can imagine it's pretty fucky, played a poem recitation on stream and got claimed by someone who sampled it for a song lmao
[8:00:06] RadicalLynx: but if they're paying for it you'd think there would be measures to avoid illegitimate claims
