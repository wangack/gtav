[3:25:15] Vizi797: Solo Leveling is also on my list, I tend to wait until they're all out before I watch stuff. I struggle doing Anime week to week

[3:25:30] lblvckmvgicl: think imma watch the 3rd episode of shogun, ill be lurking kivaLurk kivaCozy
[3:26:46] Barcca: show is great
[3:26:53] selfDisgust: everyone ive seen says its amazing. I'm waiting to binge it tho personally
[3:27:33] StandardJake: started solo leveling yesterday, it is pretty sick
[3:27:39] selfDisgust: i use to only binge anime too, but have started to do the week to week stuff instead
[3:27:40] Vizi797: Making a thing out of it definitely makes it better waiting
[3:28:04] Barcca: i usually sometimes wait for the show to be over after being scarred from Mindhunter kivaSuffer
[3:28:16] Madam_Orange: i read solo leveling awhile back, its pretty good, the ending is a bit sped up, hope they fix that in the anime
[3:28:36] uitzui: i normally never watch anything until at least a full season is out but i couldn't help myself with Frieren and now i am always eagerly awaiting Frieren friday kivaLUL
[3:29:25] selfDisgust: i got too bored with frieren. Might give it another try since everyone loves it, but the slow start wasnt for me
[3:30:18] JawJabber: Yea Im fiening for more episodes of Shogun with its weekly release
[3:30:57] Barcca: @JawJabber same
[3:31:05] Brennanan: every episode just gets better and better Gus
[3:31:07] uitzui: it will work out peepoHappy
[3:32:07] StandardJake: tough
[3:32:33] Anrisacia: YAPPP 🐶
[3:32:35] uitzui: also who wants really stingy bees
[3:32:39] Vizi797: This guy lives on a street where children are just fighting each other in the street while dogs bark constantly apparently kivaLUL
[3:33:10] uitzui: and he thinks it's great
[3:33:13] uitzui: what a guy
[3:34:50] Thrath: Simon Gladge
[3:35:29] Barcca: Simon peepoHappy
[3:35:54] uitzui: yeah it's a very rare thing for me so it makes it very enjoyable
[3:35:57] Thrath: Shogun has me like that and boy House of the Dragon gonna be so much more of it KEKW
[3:36:22] Vizi797: See I don't really like that feeling with Anime since you're fending for a week, and then you finally get to watch and it's over in 20 minutes KEKW
[3:36:24] uitzui: you are close, frieren is the german word for being very cold / freeze and they made it into the name of the main character
[3:36:27] StandardJake: house of the dragon is so good
[3:36:58] StandardJake: last couple seasons of GOT kind of bummed me out
[3:37:10] StandardJake: but house of dragons has been consistently sick
[3:37:42] Barcca: @StandardJake my brother still is mad about season 8 KEKW
[3:37:48] uitzui: the show starts after a mage called Frieren and her adventure party already finished their grand quest of defeating the demon king and the show is about her travels afterwards. Since elves live an undefined amount of time (1000s of years) her perception of time and mortality is very different than many of her friends
[3:38:19] uitzui: and she tries to better understand those she grew to love and overall just get a better understanding about a lot of things
[3:38:41] uitzui: it is rather profound in quite a few moments, i like it because it's very different and interesting
[3:38:54] xXJDOGXx17: This anime seasons must watches are Frieren ,Shangri-La Frontier ,Solo Leveling those are undoubtedly the best this season imo
[3:39:41] Nova_Nii: have you heard of Monster
[3:39:49] Tuckerbonage: What is your taste in anime?
[3:39:59] uitzui: oh god Monster is so good but i havent seen that in probably 15 years
[3:40:08] cosnik: Monster is goated
[3:40:27] Tuckerbonage: Seen Hunter Hunter?
[3:40:28] JawJabber: That reminds me i still haven't seen Blue Eyed Samurai. Maybe during my spring break kivaLUL
[3:40:50] Barcca: the only anime i ever saw was the film mind game because my brother thought it was cursed
[3:41:03] imdeatht1: Death parade is pretty good in that regard
[3:41:18] cosnik: There's some really good recent animations, primal and scavengers reign are so good
[3:41:29] c0pp3rm00n: Did ya read belladonna?
[3:41:31] Brennanan: Frieren explores a lot of mortality and loss
[3:41:34] Vizi797: I was thinking Death Parade too, but I just remember enjoying it, but it's been so long I don't really remember why I enjoyed it lol
[3:42:01] imdeatht1: Its just so unique compared to most anime i think @Vizi797
[3:42:05] Tuckerbonage: Hunter Hunter might be a decent anime to watch
[3:42:08] honor234567: have you seen Blue eyed samuri its on netflix
[3:42:09] KINGS_PURGATORY: heard the creator of dragon ball died
[3:42:29] Ryyo_: Tokyo Revengers is cool, has time travel and gangs
[3:42:35] Brennanan: i’m trying to sell it so hard lmao i genuinely think you’ll love it
[3:43:42] uitzui: Kiva if you want i can send you a reminder about Frieren when the first season is over
[3:44:19] imdeatht1: Jojo but without the big buff dudes KEKW
[3:44:19] Brennanan: something deeper than generic battle shounen
[3:44:29] uitzui: ah the evergrowing list, just like my book list
[3:44:33] FutureCorpse: I immediately went to get caught up and read all the manga after finishing the last season of JJK lol
[3:44:54] uitzui: @Brennanan, lol yeah i love one punch man because i grew so tired of generic shounen

[3:45:30] Tuckerbonage: Erased is a interesting anime too
[3:45:39] cosnik: Kids on a slope is real good
[3:46:02] uitzui: dude fuck chainsaw man, never had a show had so many good reasons for character motivation and threw them all over board in favour of horniness
[3:46:07] Vizi797: Bungo Stray Dogs is coming to mind as a suggestion. I don't think I ever finished it, but It's got that "everyone has their own unique powers" but all their powers are based on authors and books
[3:46:12] RaLee33: Kids on the slope is a great anime about jazz NODDERS
[3:46:28] toad1337: Bungo stray dogs slaps NODDERS
[3:46:30] Xylorific: Jojo isn't even "big buff" dudes by season 4. It's beautiful buffs dudes.
[3:46:39] uitzui: kivaLUL
[3:46:59] Vizi797: Yea that's the part that felt l might be the most interesting KEKW
[3:47:10] KINGS_PURGATORY: @Xylorific dont they all have the same faces?? LUL LUL
[3:47:17] uitzui: yeah Jojo is just too over the top for me
[3:47:21] Vizi797: kivaLUL
[3:47:48] GD_Kotorou: KEKW
[3:47:50] Vizi797: KEKW
[3:47:51] imdeatht1: Bruh
[3:47:56] Tuckerbonage: KEKW
[3:47:57] Barcca: KEKW
[3:48:10] StandardJake: the boys always hyping up ant
[3:48:15] Vizi797: Just gotta get Ant a saber and built a giant wall and freeze Paleto kivaLUL
[3:49:20] Vizi797: Both FMA series are one of the few shows I'll actually rewatch on a fairly consistent basis
[3:49:48] Tuckerbonage: But yeah if you like characters with unique powers hunter hunter is pretty good
[3:49:55] uitzui: have you watched Cowboy Bebop? it's another classic
[3:50:09] xXJDOGXx17: If I had to say my favorite anime of all time it's Beyond the Boundary it's not mainstream but it's so good
[3:50:37] FutureCorpse: Highly recommend Pluto as well!
[3:50:46] uitzui: it says about itself "The work, which becomes a new genre itself, will be called... COWBOY BEBOP" and it's true kivaLUL
[3:51:48] imdeatht1: but you dont like horny KEKW
[3:51:52] Necro_Ex_Mortis: I just want season 2 of Arcane, I was surprised by how much I liked that show seeing as I knew nothing about league of legends.
[3:52:01] Brennanan: god I couldn’t stand Mirai Nikki
[3:52:25] Ryyo_: Mirai Nikki is very good
[3:53:00] uitzui: Arcane did a really good job of creating a story and depicting the universe without requiring the viewer to know anything about LoL
[3:53:01] Ryyo_: the opening is a banger
[3:53:08] uitzui: i think that is a really big feat on it's own
[3:53:42] uitzui: in comparison the dota anime must be incredibly confusing for someone who knows nothing about dota
[3:54:00] Vizi797: Overwatch would probably be a more popular show than the game could ever be KEKW
[3:54:16] xXJDOGXx17: Kirikos short was so good I'd watch that movie
[3:54:19] uitzui: yeah i havent played overwatch since the first month it originally released but i still enjoy the character trailers
[3:54:27] Necro_Ex_Mortis: lol just looked it up and apparently season 2 of Arcane comes out in November.
[3:54:57] Vizi797: Yea Blizzard sucks at a lot, but their cinematics/shorts people are at a insane level
[3:55:09] Vizi797: even across games, not just overwatch
[3:55:23] Brennanan: oh you might like Welcome to the NHK
[3:56:09] xXJDOGXx17: Yeah we don't talk about the warcraft movie
[3:58:50] Thrath: If you fully fill the next both you and Rod should be able to split 5 each afterwards
[3:59:06] uitzui: i think at this point it might not be bad if they both just feed Ant becuase it will make sorting easier on the surface if it's all one recipe
[3:59:43] uitzui: and another day Rod can be the sole cook and so on
[4:01:39] uitzui: that's why they sometimes can drop like 15 on one doorstep NODDERS
[4:01:54] Thrath: kivaSus
[4:03:12] Vizi797: So Could just be whoever show's up to work first is the recipe they use that day if both cooks are present kivaSus

[4:14:37] Tuckerbonage: Oh no what have you done @uitzui
[4:16:01] uitzui: i am also wondering if someone like Dundee would buy excess bread etc for cheap cheap
[4:16:07] uitzui: or if just nobody cares about anything but water
[4:17:27] Vizi797: The pitfalls of being just too damn efficient
[4:18:31] honor234567: How many batches have you made today?
[4:19:21] Vizi797: She's putting on 31-40 right now I think?
[4:19:34] Tuckerbonage: If it made him or his group money in sure Dundee would definitely buy it @uitzui
[4:23:04] buttermode: I just watched my sisters keeper. Damn.
[4:26:56] uitzui: today of all days
[4:27:30] Vizi797: That was a really smooth maneuver side stepping and sliding right into the hole by Andi though NODDERS
[4:27:41] wizardiis: kivaJammies
[4:28:20] uitzui: i think Reed said a while ago that scavenging heals him
[4:28:23] Tuckerbonage: Doesn't the sewer heals people
[4:28:25] uitzui: with super high rep
[4:28:32] Vizi797: Reed has mentioned to Andi that searching through stuff heals him yea
[4:28:36] wizardiis: peepoPog
[4:29:36] uitzui: i think he said rummaging through the trash feels like lotion on his hands or something

[4:38:55] ZeeChan_: kivaMusic
[4:39:01] RadahTatTat: yeah and it was kind of the plan for the two of you to do this all week right? kivaSus
[4:39:32] uitzui: it's just unfortunate that a lot of tasks that are for the group end up in isolation for one person
[4:39:36] uitzui: instead of a group effort
[4:39:47] lblvckmvgicl: im back, how goes the shining ?
[4:40:29] wizardiis: NODDERS
[4:40:55] Barcca: NODDERS 󠀀
[4:40:55] RadahTatTat: i don't think rod realizes how much cora helped him gather stuff when he was first starting out NODDERS it's hard to do it on your own
[4:41:05] lblvckmvgicl: NODDERS ive always seen it that way too
[4:41:05] ceruleansea6: NODDERS
[4:41:36] uitzui: but that is a very classic hoa thing, everyone ends up going to do whatever they want and Ant + maybe one helper stay doing the things nobody wants to
[4:41:49] Thrath: Its also like the longer this process takes the more chance the end goal gets bought by someone else as well
[4:41:53] uitzui: it's the same reason why you never practiced the chop hack
[4:42:08] Vizi797: That was every online class that gave you access to everything right away I had in College. I'd go crazy at the beginning so I could just not touch it the rest of the semester. lol

[5:00:01] xillian: this music makes me think of the song 16 tons by Ford constantly for some reason
[5:00:06] imdeatht1: to be fair it would probably be just the lettuce and tomatoes weirdos people scrape off taco bell tacos
[5:00:37] uitzui: some bugs for the crunch maybe
[5:00:39] uitzui: kivaSuffer
[5:00:54] Tuckerbonage: Soggy lettuce that looks like spinach
