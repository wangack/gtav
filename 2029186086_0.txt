[4:14:40] LukeN_88: extra payslips if you take the train to work at Snr Buns
[4:15:10] ghost1805t: Environmentally friendly bonus or something
[4:15:40] ghost1805t: Like companies do for bikes in the UK
[4:15:46] MorgyBear: you need to ask for the metro to stop at places where cars can’t access
[4:15:48] benreed9: you could ask for bmx rentals at the stations for people to use when they get off so they arent completely stuck walking
[4:15:55] kavanah11: think like royal rumble on the train 100 each winner takes all
[4:16:11] CheffZed: ye being heavy on saving the environment would help probably
[4:16:17] m_1ne: Make it expensive to park in certain areas like snr buns so people have to get there with guber or trains
[4:16:24] NonStopGam3r: Less rentals left all over the roads
[4:16:35] j_dizz19: @MorgyBear They aint gonna edit the map for a metro that doesn't work properly anyway LUL
[4:16:45] DanielleG__: JuiceVibe
[4:17:19] benreed9: you could ask for bmx rentals at the stations for people to use when they get off so they arent completely stuck walking
[4:17:29] harmonyg95: Up rental prices so cars aren't left all over the place which causes environmental issues
[4:17:50] NonStopGam3r: Opportunity for multiple conducters
[4:17:54] GoodShutHazUK: the thing Denzel said about feeling some kinda way when you get on or something
[4:17:59] mollyb42O: train parties
[4:18:02] m_1ne: vending machine in the train
[4:18:03] redcristalefx: team up with snr buns and do raffles? lmao
[4:18:26] harmonyg95: Yeah that's good
[4:18:28] redcristalefx: @m_1ne that would he cold
[4:18:31] prayis_: discount on electric vehicles cos you helping the environment
[4:18:34] j_dizz19: @GoodShutHazUK Haven't they deaded off all of that stuff of making you feel better at stuff?
[4:18:36] ghost1805t: Job creation, people can be hired as staff at certain locations
[4:18:54] MorgyBear: metro stop in the sewers so you don’t need a crowbar every time, ask them to make metro driver an actual job, public advertising
[4:19:07] ghost1805t: helps interaction if you don't just step on a train
[4:19:14] mollyb42O: or a train card thats like a bus card
[4:19:19] LukeN_88: devs should've made it so that you have to pass a driving test before you can rent a car
[4:19:34] benreed9: problem with ticket system is anyone can just use it when they arent actually doing anything
[4:19:35] XQUSIT: storage on the train for people to move stuff around eg housing stuff or for business . or illegal goods
[4:19:51] gggoldenarmy: I think if you work there you should get tickets not if you just ride on the train
[4:19:55] LukeN_88: yeah I meant at start of 4.0
[4:19:59] benreed9: it would have to be linked to a business
[4:20:00] mollyb42O: a train card for workers
[4:20:07] j_dizz19: Train needs to work properly before anything can be added to be fair
[4:20:33] harmonyg95: Like how denzel said about feeling a kinda way when you ride
[4:20:51] LukeN_88: @j_dizz19 but devs won't fix the train if it's not being used for RP
[4:21:36] DanielleG__: nodd
[4:21:38] j_dizz19: @LukeN_88 Exactly...they aint gonna add any new mechanics when people don't use it yet

[4:23:43] grepipoiss44: @snoopzaka same
[4:23:44] ghost1805t: I think having more regular people on the train system is useful like having people not just you on trains so station staff, security, enhances the interactions
[4:24:11] prayis_: should be a train that goes up north
[4:24:22] MorgyBear: metro food stands
[4:24:39] LukeN_88: that's a freight train though
[4:24:47] LukeN_88: no passengers
[4:24:52] ghost1805t: Could tag on to that if they are doing freight you can do transport for people
[4:25:10] benreed9: i doubt theyll add anything food related cause that will take away from snr buns
