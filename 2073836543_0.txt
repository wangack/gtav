[0:14:54] olofstenkastarn: Samuel Baas for Commisioner @Ssaab
[0:14:54] sshineysean: allowing non senior officers (potentially even non officers) to be eligible for commissioner would’ve allowed some interesting RP. imagine commissioner Cornwood LUL

[0:15:08] citrusMangos: ssaab may not care who becomes commissioner, but who does slacks want?
[0:15:09] GustavoK___: moon just wants a commissioner so they can quickly flush out chain of command
[0:15:09] Casnih: cornwood commissioner omE
[0:15:09] azncheesy: I thought captain still calls the shot but commissioner over sees it? @Ssaab

[0:15:11] Artsii1994: I mean watching you as commionser its alot of work if you van handle it
[0:15:13] krosswynd: @Ssaab thoughts on K losing the case?
[0:15:14] Heinriiich: Turner for Commissioner and Slacks second in charge
[0:15:15] 1vivy: OOC but they were talking about commissioner responsibilities like an emergency veto or whatever
[0:15:16] TimmayHS: Having it be officer+ would be way better tbh since all the seniors were chosen by the captains.
[0:15:17] medium_5: mr k for commissioner hahah
[0:15:17] FuZroK: 1 person to blame haha
[0:15:18] chivvyy: at least the captains still control eligibility

[0:15:22] sevens777s: @Ssaab is there someone you have in mind if its not a current captain?
[0:15:22] Wintyer2: the commisioner will jsut review your calls
[0:15:23] sirsalem13: Beric, Flop or Ruby would be good commissioner
[0:15:23] h0neybadg3r_21: @Ssaab now that the legislation was passed can the Mayor be present for the Cornwood review?
[0:15:24] azz_boss: Mcnaughlty for commisioner
[0:15:24] RoninGundam: sounds like less work for slacks to deal with so  PogChamp
[0:15:26] jollypnda: it works if you use a branching style of leadership
[0:15:27] Ryaht: Beric for com
[0:15:28] buddha_hands: easier, sure, but more abuse potential.. so it's crazy they want that for 'accountability' OMEGALAUGHING
[0:15:28] Lajj: PD RP been great Clap
[0:15:29] Navigator_Nav: What does Slacks think of Cornwood being in the meeting?
[0:15:30] zabaloo: The way it is described over and over is your job wouldn't change, its someone to review your decisions
[0:15:30] kayfabedave: 1 person dealing with all the hoppers etc as well Sadge
[0:15:31] laaazylemon: I think its more like if ppl cant see eye to eye with the captains, they have one more option
[0:15:31] limerick2018: @ssaab you get less paper work W in my books
[0:15:32] randyrandoe: It's easy do what he says, can you do that
[0:15:35] SumDee_LumDee: has to be commissioner McNulty
[0:15:35] soiledmypantss: Brian Knight would love that role :)
[0:15:36] Vexamas: @Ssaab I don't think it's one person "calling the shots" I think its one person keeping the **delegated** stuff in line
[0:15:39] MajordomoPSP: Beric or Turner would be good picks imo
[0:15:42] FuZroK: need more hires. PD too small still
[0:15:45] greenmile__: it’s small enough police force, so that helps
[0:15:50] theaverage_joe4: Kappa
[0:15:50] stiltz21: lol did someone say Pred.  Aziz would go nuts
[0:15:50] urkuri92: seniors have just been getting settled LUL

[0:15:52] Vengy: Beric is great but I'm not sure who would fit the roll best yet with the current options.
[0:15:52] blowaways: can they take stuff off your plates though?
[0:15:53] driver1036: 1 person can set a standard unlike 3 separate standards

[0:15:54] aniquilattion: more hiring?
[0:15:55] snoopiessnoop: HELLO :)

[0:16:00] uknwwhtshedidurhauntingd: saabPencil
[0:16:00] ihateonions: 3 more months PepeLaugh
[0:16:01] TimmayHS: Senior Officer is the equivalent of promoting someone to "shift leader" at mcdonalds vs just giving them a manager position
[0:16:02] KooterNoodle: *lil
[0:16:03] VeninLUL: this live of reasoning is the reason The captainsare in this situation right now @Ssaab
[0:16:03] 95eagles: When is the cornwood review?
[0:16:03] BenjaminNP: when is the high council decision about conrwoods suspension being reached? @Ssaab
[0:16:03] officialChicoB: The pressure will be there because people will be expect more and more and every decision will be compared to the captains
[0:16:04] downtowncrownn: @Ssaab what ranks are you looking to add
[0:16:06] ImOome: if shitft 1 and 3 have 4 academy's maybe
[0:16:06] OkaAnt_: i mean one of the captains needs to go and we all know who
[0:16:07] DBZSnack: hopefully not the same people in the same ranks

[0:16:08] Krimson07_: moon2B mooners
[0:16:10] Chaoszero_goc: Just promote seniors?
[0:16:11] SumDee_LumDee: the nopixel public wiki had bones listed as a sergeant
[0:16:13] bahubaker: yeah but that spun mr mayor up
[0:16:13] redmistintheair: redmistintheair subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 1 month streak! AAAA
[0:16:13] shortsaga: one person has to be in charge leadership by committee does not work
[0:16:15] m1tchole: Where do you source officers from? Public?
[0:16:15] SumDee_LumDee: but someone fixed it
[0:16:15] Abdullah_8499: can captains be commissioners?
[0:16:15] randyrandoe: Think of it in days bro
[0:16:17] Mr_Mikeys: this is the reason people are upset tbh. No high command. no checks
[0:16:21] Crazziee_R_I_P: DAP decisions should be reviewed if disagreed with by subject
[0:16:22] Wintyer2: Ultimatly they could look at it and say what your doing is exactly right
[0:16:22] rmaniv: i wish people did slow burn
[0:16:24] Hannah_Honeybee: did it take this long in 3.0? i dont remember
[0:16:26] Gaz_H20: my understanding is the commissioner isn’t going to run it they are going to oversee it. captains will still run it but commissioner will overrule them when he thinks they are wrong
[0:16:26] kayfabedave: Commissioner Hawk Prayge
[0:16:26] Goose_Glue: isn’t that what captains said 2 months ago

[0:16:34] laaazylemon: but the rest of the city is way to far ahead for it to be 3 month tho, no?
[0:16:34] Petrone_72: I understand both sides but I’m leaning towards Dabs pov
[0:16:37] bbbrabbit123: Your're right PD is too small for sgt and lt why not demote one of the captains to SGT and LT
[0:16:37] ijoefromearth: saabH
[0:16:39] nivekalive: I don't think he will call the shots. He is just investigating and making suggestions if he sees fit
[0:16:40] Hibob222: ssaab!!!!!!!
[0:16:41] S7VNRedTigers: Listening
[0:16:44] BamBamRP: forte for Comiss #day2

[0:16:48] thebigshabam: ruby york for commissioner for sure
[0:16:50] the_jbearr: Havin higher ranks will help with communication, so like if the mayor cant get with a captain he can get with the legit closest thing to it
[0:16:53] olofstenkastarn: Ssaab will Cornwood be suspended in your OOC opinion?
[0:16:53] 1_ncognit0: but tbh the PD needs a chief or a commissioner
[0:16:54] JerrieDepp: can anyone be a commissioner or it’s chosen by mayors?
[0:16:55] theblackdog808: I see 100% what you're trying to keep in check
[0:16:55] Navigator_Nav: He did want information gathering first
[0:16:58] DiscretionaI: They’re going to help relieve captains from getting caught up in too much and get to focusing on what matters more?
[0:16:58] SumDee_LumDee: I think Aziz would be an awesome commissioner
[0:16:58] Mogs3: https://clips.twitch.tv/HotAbstruseTermiteTooSpicy-lFHHcqFizgmjAAWh
[0:16:59] ImOome: i mean its 2 ppl w/ pd experience going through the pd stuff
[0:17:00] ArchersGoon: Dab has pushed for some pro pd things like bonuses for FTO's
[0:17:01] azncheesy: Ruby for comish Prayge
[0:17:03] 0zarruu: well thats what the point if this is right?
[0:17:05] urkuri92: Half the chatters don't even see it and base it off one pov LUL
[0:17:06] bahubaker: definitely vote ruby for commish
[0:17:07] seanlew123: hi everyone i hope everyone had a good day
[0:17:08] GYNECHIATRIST: commissioner fenwell Maaaan
[0:17:09] nationas: moon2WOW
[0:17:10] randyrandoe: Is seem easy to say there's alot going out instead of saying what's going on LUL
[0:17:11] TimmayHS: The PD captains have good intentions, but there's still a whole lot they don't get to see.
[0:17:11] Seto27500: you have just to much on your plate and need to delegate
[0:17:11] KoppaVRP: I think having the skeleton CoC never works with Snr straight to captain, You need stages to be able to escalate and gradually and decisions be made on the way rather than just straight to the top, cas it also overwhelms the Captains
[0:17:11] Wintyer2: Cornwood would rather have LASO then Commisioner
[0:17:13] Mogs3: https://clips.twitch.tv/TriangularUnusualStapleVoteYea-_UA1K2ugsWznPV4y
[0:17:14] SanchoPanza49: They should be at the next academy
[0:17:15] Lucsvm: @Ssaab dont you feel that the work you put in the lasts months feels obsolete now? (not tryn to bait drama)
[0:17:16] uknwwhtshedidurhauntingd: saabNote saabNom saabO
[0:17:19] Mysteriass: What would Slacks do if Duncan becomes commissioner?
[0:17:19] biscuitz1776: IT needs to be someone who will PUSH back on the 3 Capts and not be a yes man to the 3
[0:17:19] redmistintheair: yep ''
[0:17:20] monacoforever: Cheer100 what would slacks do if mr k became mayor that would be insane
[0:17:21] StreamElements: monacoforever just cheered 100 bits saabPog
[0:17:22] krosswynd: @Ssaab thoughts ok K losing the case?
[0:17:23] 1_ncognit0: york is perfect as a commisioner she's FAIR
[0:17:23] Jvspar: but how will all this effect Lebrons legacy? thats what really matters
[0:17:25] monkz89: in any other world, cornwood would have been fired for insubordination @Ssaab
[0:17:25] FuZroK: just more steps in the chain. sounds like a bottle neck
[0:17:26] jahim_: well its not that its they ide'a they have a lot of people talking to them and demanding changes
[0:17:29] BamBamRP: forte for commiss ;)
[0:17:30] jollypnda: its only a rank name change so it really would change nothing
[0:17:30] SumDee_LumDee: den zel returns and become commissioner
[0:17:33] ShadyMashX: Captains should still do the same things... but seniors gotta hire too and have more permissions and captains have someone lookin over them too now
[0:17:33] buddha_hands: and multiple council members also have cop characters, so they're bound to play those characters differently/less understanding lol
[0:17:33] blowaways: there needs to be more delegation to get things moving, at least that was my sense of feedback given
[0:17:34] dagu_yo: The 3 captain system needs to change in some way
[0:17:37] KooterNoodle: there’s never “higher command” on lol
[0:17:39] randyrandoe: Nope
[0:17:39] Ryaht: @Wintyer2 he kinda leaning towards comm
[0:17:40] Hibob222: peepoClap
[0:17:40] limerick2018: New set of eyes cant hurt that’s all I say
[0:17:43] donsson: Demote 2 captains to SGT or LT and keep 1 captain. Then you dont need a commish
[0:17:47] yolmoz: Cornwood?
[0:17:49] thepixeltavern: No captain will be commissioner that is already stated lol
[0:17:50] GYNECHIATRIST: Duncaning
[0:17:52] mizkifsrecedinghairline: Does Cornwood's hiring status change after the last few days?
[0:17:54] Goose_Glue: don’t worry guys chain of command in another 12 months pog
[0:17:54] citrusMangos: who does slacks want to become commissioner? @ssaab
[0:17:56] theblackdog808: agreed
[0:17:57] 1_ncognit0: YORK
[0:17:57] S1lentcs2: Sure but Slacks is technically really young and inexperienced for the position he's in no, wouldn't it make sense for him to have a rank like SGT? @Ssaab
[0:17:57] DBZSnack: Cornwood for commisoner
[0:17:58] Laticore: OMEGALUL
[0:17:58] SumDee_LumDee: LENNY HAWK FOR COMMISIONER

[0:18:00] Mr_Mikeys: Ruby would be a great comis
[0:18:01] TimmayHS: The Donald Bush family is taking out all the best Officers in the PD
[0:18:01] KooterNoodle: RUBY WOULD BE GOOD
[0:18:03] OkaAnt_: cornwood is the people fav tho
[0:18:04] funnkinn: He would make an amazing sheriff
[0:18:05] yojimoji: york definitely would be great
[0:18:05] Eddie1225: at all OMEGALAUGHING
[0:18:05] jperry1441: i like if someone is suspened they get to speak to someone else besides the 3 captains
[0:18:08] randybobndyphone: RUBY
[0:18:08] z_0_m: I think Cornwood would prefer that too
[0:18:08] realpossible: ruby york? she might be a lil timid tho
[0:18:08] GYNECHIATRIST: fenwell's a talker Duncaning
[0:18:09] Pichoto: Chief Cornwood ONTOP
[0:18:09] Supawetdoughboy: benis
[0:18:10] DiscretionaI: If Cornwood gets pressed for murder, the other officers who shot George should be too?
[0:18:11] D00Dlles: Duncaning
[0:18:12] TJ_Ramen_: I like Mcnaulty for commish
[0:18:12] FuZroK: #nochanges current 3 captains is perfect. Officers need to be better
[0:18:12] mizzikk2401: cletus would miss patrolling
[0:18:13] JediJacob_: would you think mcnulty would be a good commissioner?
[0:18:14] bobthegibbon: Conan for commissioner? @Ssaab
[0:18:14] 98noir: berick imo
[0:18:15] Chaoszero_goc: What about aziz for commissioner?
[0:18:16] vicious_pen: I honestly don't understand how you guys don't see you're creating your own problems and inflaming them
[0:18:17] FHviding: Cornwood has to be sheriff, it is destiny
[0:18:17] Artsii1994: True yku got to be able to comprimise with people
[0:18:19] Scrando: Lenny commissioner and max mayor would be funny LUL
[0:18:20] Eskomo: can't keep everyone happy
[0:18:20] masterlurkker: cornwood fits that description though
[0:18:20] stonedmikey: YOOOOOOO
[0:18:21] fellathedude: Beric would be good
[0:18:21] Alexqc19: Nah cornwood should be senior max OMEGALUL
[0:18:24] pieruruka: Duncaning is the only valid choice

[0:18:26] blowaways: Ramee?
[0:18:26] BamBamRP: CrayonTime CrayonTime CrayonTime CrayonTime
[0:18:26] Eddie1225: people think its easy
[0:18:27] biscuitz1776: here we go...and yes Corn for Sheriff
[0:18:28] riiftzzz: I think Beric is perfect for commissioner or maybe Ruby
[0:18:30] GYNECHIATRIST: Duncaning is the obvious choice
[0:18:30] the_poff: How, with the punishments, does cornwood fix the Rp to be eligible for sheriff? I actually dont think he can
[0:18:30] 0zarruu: Honestly Ruby would be perfect for it
[0:18:31] SumDee_LumDee: AMERICAN HERO LENNY HAWK FOR COMMISSIONER
[0:18:31] zguy77: i feel like cornwood would be perfect

[0:18:34] ZelloPT: peepoWave
[0:18:34] MarsCons: what about desk sergeants do they have role in pd?
[0:18:35] StreamElements: Follow me on tiktok for stream highlights! https://www.tiktok.com/@ssaabster
[0:18:35] randyrandoe: What happened with your PD again?

[0:18:36] msdeell: beric would be good
[0:18:36] Cujodk: @Ssaab was dapping the other cap for the treason joke ever a thought?

[0:18:37] OkaAnt_: yall need a comissioner Gordon
[0:18:37] skimomoula7: Axel justice to my dick fr
[0:18:38] sirsalem13: Needs to be oversight of the PD ... it helps ensure everything is done fairly and equally. The Commissioner is just oversight and not really calling the shots day to day.
[0:18:38] Lexyz130: I personally nominate Callie as commisioner
[0:18:39] fellathedude: Flop is kinda a pushover
[0:18:39] h0neybadg3r_21: @Ssaab now that the legislation was passed can the Mayor be present for the Cornwood review?
[0:18:39] S1lentcs2: @Ssaab Conan Clarkson for commissioner? KEKW
[0:18:39] z_0_m: Jammies
[0:18:41] GYNECHIATRIST: Duncaning imagine a man
[0:18:41] ammuhl82: Beric or Ruby
[0:18:41] SonnoWins: to build out a command structure allows delegation, delegation allows time at the top to do more tasks only someone in high command can do.
[0:18:42] Mass_murder521: commissioner Clarkson Kappa
[0:18:43] Petrone_72: who would you choose for the job
[0:18:44] WATERMELONFRESH: I’m glad y’all are taking it slow with ranks compared with other servers that have bloated ranks @ssaab
[0:18:44] ShadyMashX: If all three captains are still here doing their jobs still it should be fine
[0:18:45] Wintyer2: @Scrando no lenny is shoot first kinda guy he be bad really bad
[0:18:45] vicious_pen: yeah there's a double edge to experience though.  you get to relying too much on the idea you KNOW what to do
[0:18:45] 1_ncognit0: YORK is perfect
[0:18:46] kegelblitzzz: You just can't be the ones reviewing your own calls, this is so simple
[0:18:46] limerick2018: I really like beric
[0:18:46] xCheekz: duncan for commish

[0:18:47] q3aserver: CARMINE FOR COMMISH
[0:18:47] BamBamRP: FORTE FOR COMMIS.
[0:18:47] twilightbaseballscene: duncan as commissioner would actually be so entertaining he loves to yap
[0:18:47] FamouzLemon: he would be the best
[0:18:48] dommeka: You just described Cornwood though
[0:18:48] TexanRampage92: Dunken for commissioner
[0:18:48] Tillo34: Bobby Charles for Commish
[0:18:48] Artsii1994: People on your back all the time asking you for shit
[0:18:49] Tylerfosho: Ruby or Beric for commissioner GIGACHAD
[0:18:50] TimmayHS: Cornwood would make a great commissioner, but the better RP would be for him to NOT be fired from PD and either remain an officer, be a senior officer, or be the sheriff
[0:18:50] nationas: you get a big target on your back
[0:18:50] MadHuskies: sup mr Captain Leo Daps
[0:18:52] bobthegibbon: I feel like Conan could be a decent Commissioner tbh,
[0:18:53] vicvega00: Trooper andrews

[0:19:10] KoppaVRP: I think Turner is a great choice he has such a level head and is approachable to most
[0:19:10] TexanRampage92: Dunken
[0:19:11] KDRaid: i like Ruby for commissioner :)
[0:19:11] dotslashdata: in character its the pd picking no?

[0:19:12] TimmayHS: none of the captains are getting commisioner
[0:19:13] vicious_pen: I would have said Turner but after what you guys pulled in that meeting.  It can't be any of you

[0:19:19] dagu_yo: They didn't give him any reason to pick them
[0:19:19] ArmyOfFutsak: it would make more sense for the captains to answer to the commisioner the rest of ther pd answer to the captains and commisioner liasion with the council and the current liason returns to the pd
[0:19:20] stiltz21: promoting a captain doesn’t change the power structure

[0:19:31] Navigator_Nav: Turner would be great but others are good content for all the clip channels on YT

[0:19:31] oZeIda: not up to the mayor tho
[0:19:31] Pole_Ice: YEah that's respectable
[0:19:32] duranggo: tbf, the legislation said the LSPD proposes people, the captains are the LSPD, just only propose turner
[0:19:34] tellos0: he will have no say in the names that will be sent
[0:19:34] thespicymeat_: captains have just as much ego as mayor does

[0:19:36] leavethe99: he doesn’t want the captains in power @ssaab
[0:19:36] blowaways: beric/ruby/flop/mcnulty
[0:19:38] ykicka: out of the captains Turner is the most balanced, but yeah .. out side of that Beric would be my suggestion, but then again he's shift 3 and will get "Libbied"
[0:19:39] timtheboneman: who is the "state" is it really just the mayor?
[0:19:39] Eddie1225: OMEGALAUGHING

[0:19:47] FamouzLemon: Denzel should be it
[0:19:47] olofstenkastarn: Have you seen Nikez latest music video?
[0:19:47] chrisjc77: if a civilian ocean dumps a cop, when the cop comes back they have no recollection of it ever happening so it can just keep happening over and over and over again?
[0:19:48] DiscretionaI: Work together, evolve the PD
[0:19:51] gonzogaminggtav: lenny cant be Commisioner because he is the mayor also :)

[0:19:51] icephrogg: @Ssaab can Cletus even become sheriff at this point?
[0:19:51] sharkjax: The point is someone outside of the captain can be objectivein reviewing daps so it can't be a captain.  He might let a captain be chief though, maybe
[0:19:52] Artsii1994: Forte needs time be a janitor and clean up his shit

[0:25:09] KooterNoodle: anyone else doing blinkers
[0:25:10] layla109: @the_poff I feel like Cornwood has the best relationship with Cornwood out of all of the captains. He knows Cornwood cares and has passion. If Cornwood can stay out of too much trouble, He'll be promoted. I'm positive of that.
[0:25:12] SumDee_LumDee: what’s the process like for getting access to the nopixel server?

[0:25:31] DanLGG: I think this suspension may have been the best thing for Cornwood as an officer. He’s learned a lot and gotten new perspectives that he wasn’t thinking about.
[0:25:32] TimmayHS: I wish I could have seen your face during that city council meeting @Ssaab

[0:57:05] StreamElements: Please do not meta in chat, which means do not tell Saab stuff happening in RP that his character would otherwise not know.
[0:57:06] Bill_Collector: This would have continued for another 6 months without the god mayor max
[0:57:07] jollypnda: true but you cant loosen it too much or what you buil crumbles
[0:57:08] laaazylemon: its the actuall opposite, you go slow in the build-up phase, then you make it harsher
[0:57:08] KooterNoodle: he’s bringing in the help you captains need

[0:57:14] OceanStinger: but here is where its great RP that there is a mayor that doesnt want it to take a long time. I for one cant wait to see what happens
[0:57:16] VeninLUL: starting harsh outs a negative view on the leadership from the ranks below
[0:57:17] zorahul: but doesnt doing the put a lot of stress on the people who just want to help out?
[0:57:17] huigum: @Ssaab you alone or gonna take a cadet

[0:57:47] 101toad: The thing is, I believed Slacks was a much more relaxed boss, but it feels like he bends the knee to much for the other caps
[0:57:48] c0rnishatheart: People get so pressed in chat about virtual DAPs in a video game
[0:57:51] LoneSoldier021: It's the same with anything in life, for instance a diet, you start off strict because you need to build up the discipline but after that, you can eventually have cheat days because your foundation and behaviors are strong =P
[0:57:51] Jayl0cked: Daps s/b based on in city time not ooc time. as its more punitive to people who play cop 24/7 which is silly.
[0:58:00] randyrandoe: Willfully weaponized ignorance went hard
[0:58:02] Cheexur: can I ask, do the captains believe that one of them should be commissioner? asking cuz I’m lost

[5:01:21] monkz89: shameless meta, slacks has bad memory Kappa
[5:01:33] EPiQ: @TheyCallMeGeg he did. He said Knight failed to document the scene so he went back and did it for him.

[5:02:15] Switchblade142: @talamah The charge wasn't a joke, the "falsifying evidence" part was.
[5:02:16] EPiQ: @TheyCallMeGeg right? too many hours of RP across diff streams hahaha
[5:02:19] PolygonStatic: LUL chat losin it
[5:02:26] Laticore: @hannah_grace0823 Take a break, get some fresh air

[5:02:52] yostin0239: I think this info was in the same report when you were giving Cornwood his dap
[5:02:52] TimmayHS: Cornwood told Slacks in RP that's not what happened. I wonder who Slacks will believe.
[5:02:56] HeavyMetalKittenx: jbtvCozy
[5:03:02] rando_mug: @ExoticMeats im gonna out myself here but when you watch it all day its hard not to get invested xD
[5:03:03] hvanity: Cornwood took it off him without Brian even knowing. Anyone who keeps saying that Brian is a snake has no idea what really happened that night
[5:03:11] TJFOOL: Knight wanted the case to go away quicly bc he didn't want to get sued for shooting, so he was mad they wanted to push a big charge so he went full nark
[5:03:20] throat_pump: he’s lying by omission, he was also joking and cornwood told him that he should keep the statement if he truly believed it
[5:03:28] Percolatorx: o7 cornwood

[5:03:41] dommeka: So is he trying to say Cornwood faked evidence now?
[5:03:43] talamah: @TJFOOL nice fanfiction
[5:03:45] monkz89: Anyways, um... I bought a whole bunch of shungite rocks, do you know what shungite is? Anybody know what shungite is? No, not Suge Knight, I think he's locked up in prison.
[5:03:54] TimmayHS: @throat_pump oh yea i forgot about this, that's true
[5:04:05] dakota22446: LULE classic pasta
[5:04:08] hvanity: Knight never wanted the case to go away quickly. He was fully going to take the blame for accidentally shooting the guy. Why is everyone saying all this stuff? He wasn't even worried about being sued
[5:04:09] TJFOOL: @talamah, just what i remember, seemed pretty clear to me that night
[5:04:10] djhyzel78: snake
[5:04:14] davidf4735: Does ctrl shift v work in the MDT to paste as plain text?

[5:04:22] GYNECHIATRIST: docPls
[5:04:26] DiscretionaI: Brian was scene lead. his responsibility. He passed his 95 off to aziz because he couldn’t handle his anger with the suspect
[5:04:28] rclemon_: Anyways, um... I bought a whole bunch of shungite rocks, do you know what shungite is? Anybody know what shungite is? No, not Suge Knight, I think he's locked up in prison.
[5:04:29] rando_mug: like I watch most the PD but def alot of esfand. When you stcik through with the RP on a 21 hour stream (yes that happend), its hard not to get pressed when the RP he works for might get invalidated
[5:04:34] monkz89: Anyways, um... I bought a whole bunch of shungite rocks, do you know what shungite is? Anybody know what shungite is? No, not Suge Knight, I think he's locked up in prison.

[5:04:55] steven__99: @DiscretionaI thats not true, he handed his 95 off because he shouldnt be dealing with them after shooting them accidentally
[5:04:55] SulhBatarnak: Anyways, um... I bought a whole bunch of shungite rocks, do you know what shungite is? Anybody know what shungite is? No, not Suge Knight, I think he's locked up in prison.
[5:04:56] moreperfectchan: those words never should have been written in an official report. this was an accidental officer shooting. knights playing 4D chess on an incident report… shouldn’t be acceptable.

[5:05:25] S_M_O_K_3__: Suge Knight Lives!! Tupac Lives!!
[5:05:31] hvanity: Knight couldn't have collected the evidence because he was the one who did the shooting. Another officer should have collected the evidence guys
[5:05:33] zack12359: LookingSussy
[5:05:38] DiscretionaI: @steven__99 watch the vod, he admits to passing him off because he was too mad

[5:06:16] MWRGaming: would it just be command report? if he is only a senior
[5:06:25] DanLGG: @prabs__ ahhh yeah the guy who killed Biggie
[5:06:33] hvanity: @cashcody69 but why would corn wood come to a repair shop? Slide the evidence into Brian's pocket and say I've got your back like he's hiding it. Then take the evidence off of him without Brian knowing? That is just wild
[5:06:34] focustft: @the_real_jfk I mean one is accidental and the other is on purpose

[7:16:38] philmagroin1: I wonder if commissioner would fill the seat at the table of 8 when they are appointed
[7:16:40] Drexb: duncan for commissioner NODDERS
[7:16:40] PsychoJoker: Beric for commissioner would be cool honestly
[7:16:41] dicehammertv: what if there were 3-4 candidates and the city voted...
[7:16:49] lookingfornothinghere: wait didnt slacks have a cadet KEKW
[7:16:49] omascas: @Defonicx he's not but he keeps missing the fact that he and the others got played in order for max to take over the PD
[7:16:59] dj_rendon: Duncan's doing more with that insight for Aldo to show that he'd be right for it the position himself
[7:17:02] NamesOmega: it just says top of the totem pole basically
[7:17:04] windstaff54: i said it in the discord, my vote is for beric just because i like his voice
[7:17:07] rmaniv: shift 3 CoP wont work

[7:17:17] sunaooooh: @windstaff54 based
[7:17:23] issues_i: Asking people in your presence isn't real fair if he doesn't pick you or Turner.
[7:17:27] pianoirl: the mayor gave it to you in the shift meeting aswell
[7:17:29] taraannee: i genuinely think flop is the best choice all around for it, but i don’t think he wants that position
[7:17:31] Gigadinker: are any officers going to be promoted to Senior+ before commissioner is chosen?
[7:17:31] vicious_pen: commish needs to be an outsider
[7:17:39] lehmanb: one man for the job KALE SOZE

[7:17:49] windstaff54: @vicious_pen no that is the worst idea possible
[7:17:53] Pandrax86: I do think Slacks is still a great leader.
[7:17:55] vicious_pen: not Cornwood.  Not the captains. not anybody actively in the PD at this moment

[7:18:04] danny_yel: its a position which should be heavily ooc influenced by "the state" regardless
[7:18:10] Zanduin: Commissioner has to be chosen from the existing captains or senior officers chat
[7:18:10] theredfrosts: Empowered by whom?
[7:18:17] Wintyer2: @theredfrosts the state
[7:18:18] Pandrax86: That part is key

[7:18:29] hawkeye69r: siobhan new comissioner?
[7:18:33] vicious_pen: @windstaff54 okay well what happens if Slacks is commis or Turner is the PD fire rages hire.  People won't let go.  It won't be a new beginning. It'll be an RP war.

[7:19:15] nochooch: this guy is doing 10x for PD than nakota does
[7:19:17] steven_even853: @vicious_pen you're making up nonsensical scenarios. Of course the commissioner has to be part of the PD already.
[7:19:22] RedBeardsActual: can they leave names out??
[7:19:26] Legends_333: holy Chatting
[7:19:27] vicious_pen: @omascas no it said anybody with higher up experience.  meaning can be former police leadrship
[7:19:28] Zanduin: @bill_collector I agree

[7:25:26] FaramirRat: I mean cornwood could claim mental instability or breakdown seeing his best friend in Andrews get stabbed and he went too far, if he doesn't admit it was wrong then he really needs to be a on short leash.

[7:28:46] Alexqc19: Nah old guard
[7:28:46] RobialT: Cornwood too important to be Commish
[7:28:46] Wynter282: how do you think turner as commissioner would deal with captainruth considering how hard they clash over some things
[7:28:47] rayantrex: w take julian
[7:28:48] Zanduin: BrokeRuth for commissioner
[7:28:50] DeadAssYeetOnEm: McNulty is the sleeper pick

[7:29:07] jordeon123: @Ssaab He said hard no cause personally not cause character OMEGALUL
[7:29:07] Calonis: Like esfand has been playing a lot but he might have stuff in the calendar pretty soon for otk

[7:29:25] xseaka: @BakinPacman nothing says he cant say no after being given the list
[7:29:25] Sydx11: i think roads, tunner or timmac would be good picks
[7:29:26] lookingfornothinghere: time to make Francis Commissioner he used to be chief in the past
[7:29:28] GustavoK___: jenny from the top ropes PepeLaugh
[7:29:29] LoneSoldier021: the captains still have control over who gets promoted to Sr+
[7:29:30] marneraiders: They snuck multiple clauses in LUL

[7:29:35] FuZroK: so fired officers
[7:29:36] TheRealTweex: OOC Cornwood doesn't want it
[7:29:36] theredfrosts: I so want to read this clause word for word
[7:29:36] vickyrei: Ruby Pog
[7:29:36] barelythere26: Cornwood has to be sheriff

[7:29:37] EclixQT: who has been senior in the past that is around now
[7:29:39] AnusReaktorMan: Senior captain cornwood
[7:29:40] Mofuk: I do not believe it is intended how you're framing it
[7:29:40] jordeon123: @Ssaab Ya i said Curvey not Rhodes :P He doesnt want to :P
[7:29:40] Grumplestillskin: If y’all make bones commish and I don’t get to watch him chase anymore I’ll never forgive PD
[7:29:41] FaramirRat: @teknowledgy404 na he wouldn't do that, would be funny as shit though

[7:29:44] shotzsausagefingers: i honestly think they put that in there to stop u demoting the current seniors @Ssaab
[7:29:45] RubberMBH: i mean they snuck in that they can do anything want as well with that "but not limited to"
[7:29:45] AetasTwitch: Juncan does look like James Gordon tinfoilhat

[7:29:48] Oceloteer: u got it
[7:29:49] AetasTwitch: Duncan*
[7:29:50] Pandrax86: Honestly Ssaab, I think that little "clause" might be a good thing for you. It opens it up to some officers who have had a lot of experience and just haven't reached senior yet in 4.0.
[7:29:50] nconn8: i heard thru the grapevine wrangler will be back
[7:29:51] nochooch: beric or ruby seem good, largely clean from shenanigans
[7:29:52] DonnBeach: Cornwood said today he wanted it

[7:29:55] spartacus1j: No way thats the case, why would they take example from a failed state?
[7:29:55] flugel_binder: gotta be approved by X koil and bhudda LUL
[7:29:55] philmagroin1: sneaky, but keeps captains from gate keeping

[7:30:13] NarwhalArgy: @IvyOlive That's why it said Senior+
[7:30:14] arcticOP: @IvyOlive captain is above senior
[7:30:14] 2emedy: Lebron or Soze Prayge
[7:30:16] r_kol: @HealzPleaze Was Game Garden/HCC of the Rangers
[7:30:17] DefeinatelyNOTJRhymes: if you reinstate Cornwood he has to go back to Cadet phase.
[7:30:21] theredfrosts: can you give turner some food? His yumping makes me feel better.
[7:30:22] layla109: @LoneSoldier021 yeah. hate it or love it, it's fair that way for the PD or else it's an overreach of power. *shrugs*
[7:30:26] r_kol: @r_kol Game Warden

[7:30:37] nochooch: has the PD crunched performance by # reports/charges?
[7:30:37] xseaka: @BakinPacman i dont think he will ignore everyone, but i have a feeling that names he doesnt think are a good fit wont get passed along
[7:30:44] Zhang_1888: @DefeinatelyNOTJRhymes 100%
[7:30:53] Zanduin: Why does Cornwood have to go back to cadet?
[7:30:53] LoneSoldier021: @layla109 it's just unfortunate cause they can gatekeep
[7:30:54] Legends_333: Aware how did it go?
[7:30:55] zellitan: PepeLaugh
[7:31:00] NarwhalArgy: Fix the annoucement! Reee

[7:31:10] Pandrax86: Soo.. without Prio on the WL server it's 20 minutes to get on after a storm, eh?
[7:31:11] taraannee: i think flops hard work is under appreciated <3
[7:31:12] jadetortoise: you need after
[7:31:13] ItsEdBoi_: Keep After
[7:31:18] arcticOP: @Zanduin he doesnt yet, nothing has been set by the review yet
[7:31:18] r_kol: Richard Richardson for Commish NODDERS
[7:31:19] MsFreya_x: @Pandrax86 yes
[7:31:22] BakinPacman: @xseaka pretty sure if the majority voted for turner like 90% it would force his hand LUL
[7:31:22] Sleepwalkerw: don't delete the after Maaaan
[7:31:22] RobialT: BRUH
[7:31:23] IKEA_DOG: you need after
[7:31:25] raksal_: ICANT made the same mistake
[7:31:26] HavenAU: I cant believe how much good RP cornwood getting suspended has created
[7:31:28] ItsEdBoi_: U deleted the after portion
[7:31:29] RobialT: YOU NEED THE AFTER
[7:31:30] jadetortoise: @Ssaab after is still part of the final version
[7:31:32] NamesOmega: the after is still part it was just edited

[7:31:33] kaweka308: YOU SCUFFED IT

[7:31:39] Moobot: Thanks for subbing, Raithen2! Welcome to the Saabscribers! saabH
[7:31:44] hembloop: FLOP for comish?
[7:31:48] jordeon123: Correct way to do it YEP
[7:31:54] Najb0lji: nobody is going to know Cletus is still on the running
[7:31:55] xseaka: @BakinPacman its also not a vote, people put their names forward
[7:31:56] Zanduin: @arcticop chat said he had to. Idk why this chat back seats so much
[7:31:57] 1vivy: oo
[7:32:00] Twin_Hallow: so why are some ppl scared of it?
[7:32:00] TheRealTweex: @DefeinatelyNOTJRhymes He won't. How can you send an FTO back to Cadet training? What does that say about leadership making him an FTO.
[7:32:01] AloofMango: YAPPP
[7:32:03] eqnjn: You need to keep the after edit though don't you?
[7:32:05] Najb0lji: (pending review)
[7:32:07] TimmayHS: right, but the after isn't in the document anymore
[7:32:07] Pandrax86: @MsFreya_x Gotcha. I don't remember it being that long back in 3.0. I just recently started back on the WL again. having no prio anymore stinks WutFace

[7:32:18] Konkwistador_1002: @Ssaab you deleted a cection
[7:32:25] arcticOP: @Zanduin doom spiraling is fun /s
[7:32:37] Studdchudly: Studdchudly subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! ❤️
[7:32:51] Pandrax86: @qats True, You have to just hit the server right at that mark after storm or it is nasty until the evening/ late night I have noticed.
[7:32:57] layla109: @LoneSoldier021 that can be said for most of government unfortunately. Cliques form, preferential treatment, nepotism. Like max making his wife a high position can be seen as nepotism. It's unavoidable.
[7:32:58] LoneSoldier021: who uses facebook?
[7:33:01] PandaEatingCookie: Slacks posts facebook memes?
[7:33:03] javibcardi: Meme squad saabDink
[7:33:05] Stefive: Wouldn't PD be the one giving the names going by the wording though?
[7:33:07] PandaEatingCookie: NOOO
[7:33:21] DefeinatelyNOTJRhymes: @therealtweex it’s called a demotion.
[7:33:33] Stefive: as in give the names to the mayor to give to the feds
[7:33:35] StreamElements: Make sure to check out my Youtube Channel!  saabHype -  https://cutt.ly/SaabYT
[7:33:36] LoneSoldier021: @layla109 very true, I don't know how that was allowed either but it is what it is I suppose
[7:33:38] kasis87: set them to 30
[7:33:38] Zanduin: Thats sadge
[7:33:41] kasis87: effective
[7:33:43] kernalflock: saabHi howdy how's the stream been?
[7:33:43] HavenAU: more fair if its from here on out
[7:33:49] kojobach: GoHmmm
[7:33:53] dreggy69: new policy should be grandfathered imo but thats just me random chatter
[7:33:54] TimmayHS: should be retroactive to help ppl out
[7:34:00] Pandrax86: I think you should just knock any daps from 30 days ago off.
[7:34:00] BiggShruggz: retro is impossible
[7:34:08] Zanduin: Someone who got dapped yesterday has 60 days and someone dapped today is 30
[7:34:13] ComradeGreetingCard: poor aziz
[7:34:13] the_poff: @BiggShruggz its a document with dates, its very possible

[7:34:16] Pandrax86: @BiggShruggz They have a report of all daps given. its very nicely laid out.
[7:34:19] Eddie1225: !permit logicweasel
[7:34:19] StreamElements: @logicweasel, you will not get timed out for the next 60 seconds.
[7:34:20] ArdentCause: LOL
[7:34:20] TheRealTweex: @DefeinatelyNOTJRhymes Yes but that reflects very poorly on the decision to make him an FTO in the first place. More ammo for Max just saying
[7:34:22] ArdentCause: so cornwood.
[7:34:25] Eddie1225: @LogicWeasel post again
[7:34:28] LogicWeasel: https://zepto.scrolller.com/every-bankjob-4ru714iqee-500x572.jpg

[7:34:41] grandepike: is senior+ 60+yr olds
[7:34:41] random_viewer_55: Eugene for Commisioner
[7:34:42] khrow: cornwood was senior captain
[7:34:42] random_viewer_55: KEKW
[7:34:43] GrumpyTreeFrog: conan will be putting in his interest LOL
[7:34:43] FaultyOne: War Hero Conan Clarkson
[7:34:44] eqnjn: Ask the mayor? LUL
[7:34:47] GustavoK___: xdd
[7:34:48] Ned15: Then even transfers from can be Commissioner even cadets and PPO
[7:34:49] wintersoldier2712: Rhodes is perfect for Cmmoish even if he dont want it. He didnt want undersheriff or sheriff and got it in 3.0 @Ssaab
[7:34:51] walkgleesh: @layla109 chief of staff is chosen by the mayor. it's like being someone's right hand/ secretary. there is no conflict
[7:34:51] FuZroK: @TimmayHS Senior citizen
[7:34:52] duranggo: Technically as written only the LSPD can officially submit names which means the captains acting in concert
[7:34:52] Pandrax86: Cornwood has reached the rank of senior citizen.
[7:34:52] Legends_333: LULW not wrong
[7:34:53] ArdentCause: OH GOD CONAN
[7:34:55] FuZroK: LUL

[7:35:14] lovelee___: commissioner James Randall
[7:35:15] ChirithyChi: monkaEyes james randal
[7:35:15] the_poff: @Eddie1225 carmine?
[7:35:16] DefeinatelyNOTJRhymes: @therealtweex fired Den for lesser DAPs. Cornwood has excessive force DAPs
[7:35:19] samynilla: Can he edit the list?
[7:35:20] Pandrax86: Slacks for MVP.
[7:35:20] Mitashkii: Max has to choose from seniors right?
[7:35:22] kreloril777: what if moon nominates lenny, lol
[7:35:24] urkuri92: @Hibob222 not the mayors choice
[7:35:26] supaiiii: Eugene is the most senior citizen so he's the most qualified Oldge
[7:35:28] layla109: @LoneSoldier021 Yeah. The thing with No pixel is, it's a content server and let's the RP'ers shape the city at large so things like this are bound to happen. We're just along for the ride. :)
[7:35:31] Hegemong: @Mitashkii The mayor doesnt choose
[7:35:33] Kryptonautti: Bobby Charles for commissioner
[7:35:35] 1vivy: James Randal!
[7:35:36] BiggShruggz: @Pandrax86 yes, but are they dragging back daps from the timeline?
[7:35:39] HavenAU: Duncaning do better
[7:35:40] Zanduin: @hibob222 mayor does not make final choice.
[7:35:40] neptunesstorms: @hibob222 its the state’s choice tho
[7:35:46] Killsauce: Mitashkii he doesnt get to choose at all. just forwards to the state
[7:35:47] TimmayHS: It's a time for listening and learning and helping and integrity KEKW
[7:35:48] smbsocal: @supaiiii Yeah or James Randall
[7:35:48] Mitashkii: @Hegemong so whats exactly changing ? LUL
[7:35:49] JennyHell: I'm rooting for Turner saabAw

[7:35:57] justhylian: Aziz would be a great commissioner
[7:35:58] Cheekyman08: @kreloril777 he cant, conflict of chars
[7:35:58] flugel_binder: anyone with years of exp could apply LUL
[7:35:58] shizbang_: What's the "new dap system"
[7:35:59] Hibob222: @urkuri92 the mayor did this UltraMad
[7:36:01] Sir_Tootsie: madgeNOW HIRE CHATTERBOX

[7:36:13] Twin_Hallow: im interested in what our other captain will think
[7:36:17] ibwilly75: ibwilly75 subscribed with Prime. 
[7:36:17] ExoticMeats: Also the man for the job!!!!
[7:36:23] HavenAU: @Sir_Tootsie chatterbox cop arc would be wild
[7:36:25] alexskater5027: whats ISO?
[7:36:25] ExoticMeats: Aldo
[7:36:29] billasensei: Did Ru7h left the Server?

[7:36:47] Axcennts: You need to show Trygg's music video in this meeting for ISO @Ssaab it's so good
[7:36:49] DefeinatelyNOTJRhymes: @therealtweex Slacks told him he could be charged for murder for the “1 for Sam Baas”
[7:36:51] danny_yel: i feel like aldo will be the pick by the state
[7:36:53] ExoticMeats: @billasensei  no lol
[7:37:00] flugel_binder: The server owners have final say Jebaited
[7:37:11] 00Elite: @alexskater5027 International Organization for Standardization (standardizing something like date in this case)
[7:37:12] Pandrax86: @BiggShruggz I think it would be relatively easy to go back on the dap list and remove any "minor" daps from 30+ days. I think it would show a real effort on changing and leading by the will of the police department as a whole. but either way it makes for good RP.
[7:37:20] kreloril777: @Cheekyman08 ok, but moon is also an admin.. so he might be able to get away with it

[8:21:34] layla109: @f_e_n_n Yeah, he's good a sharing but as a commissioner, a lot of discipline and patience comes into play. It's more than just talking, I'd wager. Duncan overshares which is a bad habit. He'll go way off the mark and talk people into a coma! Then he'll want to talk to slacks about how he feels AND the commission which is .. +4 more hours. LUL  I love the guy tho.
