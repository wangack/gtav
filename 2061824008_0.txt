I don't mind it, more Esfand-o-Love for me. More Cornwood. How can I complain? :D Also, no worries. <3 Thanks for the discussion and your understanding.

[0:55:11] leviathan297: seems to me like the PD hiring system was finished but every other job is a placeholder
[0:55:15] Bearcat_77: The prices of things and the low rate at which you earn money makes it so you have to grind forever to get the money to buy toys to use in rp.
[0:55:16] Clankoo: you have to do pve cause you need to grind a month for a pistol
[0:55:17] DuelMasterYugi: tell that to Jason
[0:55:17] AyeTyp1cal: Do you Think adding More Rp Stores would make for better content? bar with darts/pool ? bowling alley with pins n lanes?!
[0:55:19] shmeeso: I partially agree but they need to ensure those people can't be dicks or isolate new characters

[0:55:26] Majopa22: xdd Snr Buns
[0:55:27] BumbleFumbleLord: excessive farming is def killing RP, they need to cut currency faucets while also encouraging pay raises in docs, cops, etc. they could also slow rep decay to make grinding less encouraged
[0:55:28] dudemanbroo: they need more than just a couple managers. the PDs issues is that there is 3 captains doing like 12 people’s job
[0:55:28] Great_Chachino: every job is miserable

[0:57:23] EluSivIcZeROxAwE: Sup @esfandtv
[0:57:27] WeirdBeardPlays: I feel like there should be a wipe of money/houses when everything is ironed out
[0:57:27] bigKwam: imo , if ur playing gta rp for a living on twitch, you deserve to have a really hard grind
[0:57:28] KMGP_Outlaw: PD is about to be screwed
[0:57:30] PsychoJoker: cornwood is not a crim LUL why do people ask for a crim arc with him
[0:57:30] wavy__________________: keeping up with the johnson rp
[0:57:30] eestr120: but what do managers even do about grinding?
[0:57:32] marshmallow12900: is this car manual
[0:57:35] degeneratehermit: need to have objectives that move people around and force interaction
[0:57:36] ushwo080: hi boss
[0:57:37] autisticboots: People r forgetting that this server is BRAND NEW, which is why there is 0 crim things to do that pay ATM
[0:57:40] EvrXArt: The tough part is putting in a money sink that levels out the "ginders" but doesnt hit the non-grinders too hard
[0:57:41] Zendorea: Zero Sum
[0:57:42] azncheesy: Fines are expensive taxes are expensive force to grind LUL
[0:57:42] KMGP_Outlaw: @EsfandTV did you ever get reimbursed?
[0:57:43] matanzlatan2000: @bigKwam not really.
[0:57:46] KappaManJason: are you on channel 2 still?
[0:57:48] Janman88: @Nsan7 he is a great player but also saying alot if the day is long
[0:57:52] autisticboots: People r forgetting that this server is BRAND NEW, which is why there is 0 crim things to do that pay ATM!
[0:57:52] BumbleFumbleLord: PD shouldn't have  abudget and should be one of the best paying jobs
[0:57:53] AardvarkAndDedication: That was last night?
[0:57:57] Joongi_: That is SO bad kekw
[0:57:57] freddyvalens: pd engines gonna be down bad bad

[0:58:05] Gachiguru: AINTNOWAY
[0:58:06] Janman88: bottleneck the PD is NOT SMART
[0:58:06] StreamElements: 6x AINTNOWAY combo
[0:58:07] CalculatedRH: Imagine how bad it would feel to get fired from your PD Job as a streamer because of "budget" @EsfandTV
[0:58:08] ushwo080: hi boss/
[0:58:08] Alistic: can't make payroll NOPERS
[0:58:09] cecil_d_jacobs: u ran that red
[0:58:10] ghostpuff__: doomer
[0:58:10] Kawika219: if they're gonna make the economy realistic and things tied to civ jobs, they need grinders lol
[0:58:11] the_real_jfk: plus the pay raise doesnt help
[0:58:11] Bearcat_77: Theres a ton of tax on everything, is there a system that actually uses that tax money?
[0:58:12] cecil_d_jacobs: and that one
[0:58:12] Joongi_: It was like 2 nights ago
[0:58:18] badperson1234: No blinker don't tell Ruth esfandHappy
[0:58:19] chivvyy: have u talked to them about this yet
[0:58:19] jburke23: When I heard that I couldn't believe it. That's taking RP way too serious instead of being fun
[0:58:20] wavy__________________: imagine no overtime, no shooot
[0:58:23] duskinter: Going to cause Quotas?
[0:58:25] KMGP_Outlaw: sounds like the server is getting killed
[0:58:26] OutlawStar_x: mhm
[0:58:26] Kelborn: putting that budget constraint in, hurts the RP, and the RP should be the #1 priority when making decisions
[0:58:26] BumbleFumbleLord: yeah, that is flat out never fun
[0:58:27] DirtyDulay: Hiii Esfand
[0:58:27] tonecomms: o7 Outnumbered o7 Outgunned o7 Outfinanced
[0:58:28] Lordrune13: @autisticboots server is not new 4.0 is new
[0:58:28] PeterPanTheKing: I dont really think its that bad
[0:58:29] Clankoo: server's dying slowly
[0:58:29] Kaztiell: maybe they dont want pd to be grinders aswell and also go buy houses and have civ life
[0:58:29] claptil: Also getting sued
[0:58:29] Janman88: that is another idea which is great on paper but is NO FUN playing @EsfandTV
[0:58:30] Inz4ne_: way too much like real life
[0:58:31] Jrey000: idk who thought that was a good idea LULw
[0:58:31] jtm0516: why is hiring associated to a budget? like come on this is rp not real life
[0:58:32] Ntrpy__: cornwoods gonna have to take a sabbatical KEKW
[0:58:32] The_Aged_Savage: representative for the Rp
[0:58:35] HeyMeghan: I mean they couldn’t even repair the cars they had with the budget. Cornwood had to do that.
[0:58:35] Luthercorpz: That is a little too crazy yah
[0:58:35] xMellen: has there been more crime since people got "fired" for felonies?
[0:58:35] notlimah_: yup
[0:58:37] Connorbrow: @windstaff54 The PD is massively understaffed, they need 3x the amount of people which is going to cost a lot
[0:58:37] alexis18op: YEP
[0:58:38] shmeeso: 100%
[0:58:38] PuNchiNg: so what you're saying is be like ramee Hmm
[0:58:38] Aspecticor: YEP
[0:58:38] andysalad123: true and real
[0:58:39] KMGP_Outlaw: server health sounds horrible
[0:58:40] Kaisenjin: @EsfandTV But why only the cops have a budget?
[0:58:41] thetrueogcinnamon: Trueee
[0:58:41] bishdaddyfresh_: @EsfandTV Seems like the Police are the only ones who actually have to RP. On top of that they make it too realistic like you said
[0:58:41] pustilence: @duskinter they basically ahve quotas already
[0:58:41] Alistic: true too realistic can be the ultimate fun killer
[0:58:42] deadbyhunting: Turns the game into a simulator rather than a RPG
[0:58:42] AardvarkAndDedication: Yeppers
[0:58:43] Vlasvilneous: yeah, its kinda what happened in last session
[0:58:43] sixoddeight: oh i see PD wants bailouts like irl
[0:58:43] DatDudeLARKIN: yea, if they budgeted it, the crims would literally just beat the shit out of cop cars until the city had no budget to keep up. @EsfandTV
[0:58:43] TheLegendBruh: its likee tarkov
[0:58:44] autisticboots: @Lordrune13 which is the server no?
[0:58:48] RaicoP: Hmm
[0:58:49] jburke23: I personally think if that is what they do that will kill the server
[0:58:49] WeirdWetFart: PD are just server jannies peepoSad
[0:58:49] JerrieDepp: that's true
[0:58:50] cecil_d_jacobs: for real cmon who wants to see real life
[0:58:50] TheAmenadude: People confuse realism with immersion
[0:58:51] 1Tesla1: sounds like the nail in the coffin
[0:58:51] Creative145: you have such a doomer mentality its crazy @EsfandTV
[0:58:52] Stagnation: crims aren't paying taxes, so your budget sucks, so they just keep getting away with everything
[0:58:52] smokeweedeverydad: yup
[0:58:52] ethanmn1280: .............
[0:58:52] soloral: then cops should rp brides and corruption
[0:58:52] SacredTaquito_: Realistic rp servers always are grind fests
[0:58:52] eqnjn: Chat he doesn't know that the treasurer won't give PD any budget PEPW
[0:58:53] Luthercorpz: Cop pay should not be connected to a budge
[0:58:53] Joongi_: LETSGOOO HE SAID THE THING
[0:58:53] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: amen!!!
[0:58:53] ethanmn1280: ..
[0:58:53] philmagroin1: no one RPs to budget
[0:58:54] Janman88: it alread is a SIMS clone
[0:58:54] Lucid_Jaydee: WHAT THE FUCK, cause cops arnt already like a patch and a half behind already
[0:58:54] masontheartist: i think the point of this being a game is to shortcut the boring stuff (like grinding, and papework) BIG AGREE
[0:58:54] wavy__________________: trueee
[0:58:55] thepeacefulgoon: ew SecondLIfe
[0:58:55] killaton: i agree with esfand/cornwood 10000%
[0:58:55] Entropystachio: RP in a video game WhaT
[0:58:55] 55Hoes: already second life for many
[0:58:55] ZannahValin: Yeah there is a lot of down time
[0:58:55] Chrisaroo_: Self insert life
[0:58:57] PowerTurbo: just make repairs cheaper
[0:58:57] DirtyDulay: not what’s intended
[0:58:57] Boblhead: no more 16 hours strems?
[0:58:57] avaell_: YEP
[0:58:57] leviathan297: Just have the PD work some g6 4HEad
[0:58:58] KenKardashian: Second Life KEKW
[0:58:58] Ebonhawke7: job #2
[0:58:59] GloriousGlutton: problem for pd too is that because captains are so busy they’re so far removed from how the economy has changed so there’s a huge disconnect on how to approach and pay for things
[0:58:59] PetahPipah: i dunno, I like to escape life by going back to real life
[0:59:00] brukk__: i feel like problem is pd internal rp is too realistic while city is not
[0:59:00] jessielight: gluSims
[0:59:00] chivvyy: i think they could rly use your guidance on this
[0:59:00] freddyvalens: people actually gonna be fighting for who charges the crims :D
[0:59:01] CHEATERS_UNITE: 2nd life WutFace
[0:59:01] WayILive: there should be a shift limit honestly, for all jobs pd included
[0:59:01] Panos_97: It already is
[0:59:03] TheLegendBruh: second life mentioned
[0:59:03] McDonnell60: I agree, however paperwork is self-inflicted as the police tend to chase charges more than RP
[0:59:04] MrDher: Second Life, not that good...
[0:59:04] driver1036: Well.  Tell koil this
[0:59:05] thepeacefulgoon: CORNWOOD Preach my Bruddha!
[0:59:06] EnDecc: Second Life, but without the furries, like what's the point anymore at that point
[0:59:07] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: boring stuff is what’s happening
[0:59:07] sixoddeight: the pd will have a pub in no time
[0:59:07] RobRoads: Needs to be like Reno 911 or something like that
[0:59:09] jdotno: it makes a lot of other things things matter though like taxes, mayor's, elections
[0:59:10] Jurgen___: first life for some
[0:59:10] serpentosmorales: Thats why RUTH needs to be fired
[0:59:11] NonToxicant: good analysis
[0:59:11] Vlasvilneous: What happened was, the government dictated and messed with the PD based on budget. @EsfandTV
[0:59:15] killaton: i agree 10000% i agree 10000%
[0:59:15] rhaziaa: Can't have a Second Life if you've got no life to start with.
[0:59:15] Vexiaaa: Some of your RP requirements seem to be a bit much. You should be enjoying the game and not have to treat it like a second job.
[0:59:15] 55Hoes: 3rd life
[0:59:15] whysocial: DAPs are scirtting the realism/fun boundary IMO
[0:59:17] BumbleFumbleLord: no one wants a second job in their video games
[0:59:17] Creative145: you have such a doomer mentality its crazy @EsfandTV 󠀀
[0:59:18] MackPlays: The admins can just increase the budget then
[0:59:21] Aspecticor: god he's spittin
[0:59:22] meelion: Wouldn't we need to see the numbers, to know if that will truly be the case?
[0:59:22] xMellen: wow esfand and vivek(rp ofc) has the same views
[0:59:23] georgiaassasin: best explanation by far
[0:59:23] skeletonmike: my college had a campus in second life lmaoo
[0:59:24] Chrisaroo_: You get Dapped for being team content
[0:59:24] Jnick: did he go live on his alt earlier by accident? xdd
[0:59:25] Jrey000: I have said this from the start I think people are taking Rp too serious and this a perfect ex of making it too realistic
[0:59:25] bamboniiii: can you please tell graycen everything you just said
[0:59:26] cecil_d_jacobs: you son of a bitch using the lights
[0:59:26] fabby83: it is not very enjoyful to watch "grinding live" imo
[0:59:27] Stagnation: It's a SHITSHOW
[0:59:27] Vlasvilneous: Those were some tough times for the PD
[0:59:28] 55Hoes: great take
[0:59:29] cecil_d_jacobs: corruption
[0:59:29] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: @serpentosmorales exactly
[0:59:33] chivvyy: @Creative145 everybody call this guy out
[0:59:33] DirtyDulay: Cornwood isn’t going to let this SHITSHOW get outta hand
[0:59:33] ZuldeadTV: cops are doing paperwork all day, crims and civs doing grind jobs all day, sounds weird really
[0:59:34] RealThugi: Why cars are from pd budget? isnt the officers have to buy their own cars?
[0:59:35] Alistic: SHITSHOW
[0:59:36] overnaflash: where is cornwood?
[0:59:37] MackPlays: It should be treated more like a game than real-life
[0:59:37] Janman88: dean beeing the prime example: making great content - gets suspension
[0:59:41] iNF3RNO_ZA: errbody poor, yet 35+ ppl always infront of snr buns doing nuffin'
[0:59:43] jinnytolls: 4.0 feels dead already compared to 3.0 for both cops and crims. I do like the introduction of more civ stuff but its very lacking
[0:59:43] Astavexa: @whysocial They should be completely removed or reworked
[0:59:44] GhostSkull0: @esfandtv nobody’s gonna wanna play anymore because it’s too realistic
[0:59:47] smokeweedeverydad: Even X has said we need more police otherwise police run the risk of going harder to counter the low numbers and that leads to hell week and then it's fucked.
[0:59:49] masontheartist: Not to mention daps encourage you to play less frequent so you make less mistakes
[0:59:51] rhaziaa: When will they ban GDKPs in GTA RP?
[0:59:52] Spired12: how long was 3.0 going for? years?
[0:59:52] thepeacefulgoon: Preach Cornwood! esfandVIBE esfandVIBE esfandVIBE esfandVIBE esfandVIBE esfandVIBE esfandVIBE esfandVIBE esfandVIBE esfandPls esfandPls esfandPls esfandPls esfandPls esfandPls esfandPls esfandPls esfandPls

[0:59:53] itskoitheboi: this man knows grinding
[0:59:55] Nsan7: YEP you spitting
[0:59:56] ZuldeadTV: it does feel like real life, and real life is boring NotSure
[0:59:56] Astral_Rage: I cum that
[1:00:00] Vexiaaa: The excessive requirements seem to be a turn off.
[1:00:00] jessielight: maybe more OOC meetings while this world is building?
[1:00:01] im_ryebo: Hmm
[1:00:02] Kaztiell: @Spired12 3 years
[1:00:02] RaicoP: Hmm 󠀀

[1:00:05] Gary7887: Gary7887 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[1:00:05] mattchutt: you’re smart
[1:00:05] RetPaladinBot: @EsfandTV - Gary7887 just resubbed at Tier 1 for 6 months PagChomp
[1:00:05] DirtyDulay: Ex EA Dev right here LUL
[1:00:06] killaton: i agree so much i so agree you are so very right
[1:00:07] Mystikalrush: Did you know you do air quotes with your eyebrows? @esfandtv
[1:00:09] God_is_a_cat_girl: @EsfandTV that is why I like the simulator analogy, Euro truck devs said they don't want the game/sim to be too real because it stops being fun, so they prefer less real but still realistic and game enough to be fun
[1:00:10] Chrisaroo_: ownerBTW
[1:00:10] ShadowSithBane: I am getting tired of trying to find someone rp'ing, everywhere I go I see people grinding rep/digging in the sewers.  I miss the storylines and drama
[1:00:10] daedayz: melee needs nerfs, ranged needs buffs or reduce armor mit.
[1:00:11] sixoddeight: so you have a vote of 1
[1:00:12] Janman88: DAPs literally punish u when u play too much
[1:00:14] ProxyFrog: OSFrog
[1:00:16] Clankoo: dont blame the players man blame the ones that made it this way, its just a grindfest thats how they made it
[1:00:16] wolfgang_86: Maybe the mayor can have a meeting with people who wants to run the mechanics in place like a workplace
[1:00:17] chivvyy: u like the elon musk of mmos NODDERS
[1:00:17] andysalad123: huh
[1:00:17] Alistic: valid points for sure

[1:00:53] PsychoJoker: its called being a realist
[1:00:53] 404yak: it's just a balance issue.  there are so many different perspectives in RP, so that means different opinions on how it should be handled.

[1:00:59] 1CaptainRedBeard1: DAPs aren't really that big of a deal as long as there is a way to handle them. If they had classes where you could RP them off and develop DAPS would be fine.
[1:00:59] Houtss: @Creative145 you clearly dont watch enough
[1:00:59] typicaluser777: He's repeated that line so many times in this chat
[1:01:00] bobbybeee: you shouldn't have to explain yourself... Just let the fools be fools...
[1:01:00] 55Hoes: he’s providing constructive criticism
[1:01:00] Dathose: bro doesn't even fully understand the crim side.

[1:01:08] dains84: OneGuy
[1:01:08] Republic_of_texas: there’s no activities in the game not related to the grinding or gold sink. it’ll be down to criminals and grinders vs. the PD

[1:01:10] Joongi_: IT'S OVER
[1:01:10] DFresh015: ability to see a problem = doomer

[1:01:12] Rexnoct: critiquing*
[1:01:13] BumbleFumbleLord: honest criticism is not doomerism
[1:01:13] Aspecticor: OMEGALUL HES DOOMING
[1:01:13] sendemup: LULW wants something to be better = doomer LULW
[1:01:15] Janman88: well what i meant is all those small additions, like daps instead of strike points, culminate in a bigger issue kinda?
[1:01:16] i_n_s_o_m_n_i_o_u_s: its called being objective you ding dong

[1:01:25] bloomdazee: that’s why they say don’t take things too seriously cause it’s  content / entertainment
[1:01:26] JustinBeaver_: everything does suck
[1:01:26] whysocial: typical doomer response
[1:01:26] jessielight: realist vs doomer two very different things
[1:01:26] rotarydawg: dude is probably just a RP cop hater
[1:01:27] Chrisaroo_: Its just being able to identify potential issues and working to correct them LOL
[1:01:28] jdaman1234: what are the cop "mmo" mechanics.  Like how do they advance?
[1:01:28] jburke23: I think it's pretty clear too that if you take the RP too serious and realistic that kills the fun. We don't play games for them to be hyperealistic
[1:01:29] dapyman: Constructive criticism
[1:01:30] Gandalf_the_Mandalf: acknowledging there are issues is NOT being negative
[1:01:30] FlashyChicken32: objective criticism != doomer
[1:01:31] BaitIHaveUlt: logical thinking = doomer YEP
[1:01:31] RealThugi: @Connorbrow Or use the ones they are using now,till they get enough money
[1:01:32] walkgleesh: i think every business and crime thing should be run by roleplayers and be less mechanic
[1:01:32] Alistic: right right - were not manifesting doom here... we're brainstorming solutions
[1:01:32] chickenwienersoup: you can believe that and not constantly bring it up
[1:01:33] spartacus1j: Do you acknowledge that your opinion is heavily biased towards one side of the server?
[1:01:34] TimmayHS: Is there any recourse that you or others (admins?) have to flag these problems with the devs? @EsfandTV
[1:01:35] iNF3RNO_ZA: elden ring sucked cause i couldnt finish it
[1:01:37] Boblhead: that person drinks his water out of lead cups
[1:01:38] KojiMoons: Shitshow
[1:01:39] Janizki_Fin: Im a game dev and what esfand talks about makes alot of sence. I just hope adjustments are made before its too late. Talking about seeing problems is always good for open discussion. We do it at work all the time
[1:01:39] daedayz: LOL
[1:01:39] serpentosmorales: @EsfandTV but why don't just ignore these negative people?
[1:01:40] sh00pz: i fucking hate people that cant discern between criticism and being a doomer
[1:01:40] Janman88: improvement should always be the goal
[1:01:40] stevens116: esfand is helping the server by pointing out possible issues
[1:01:40] ChatCzar: only real doomers are the people who actually use that word
[1:01:41] bradzehh: thoughts on other streamers like doug/nip/zaceed etc getting lots of good content? maybe it is pd issue
[1:01:42] KojiMoons: FRICK
[1:01:44] jack__burton: yea quality RP seems to be struggling in 4.0.  everything is forced into the grinding systems
[1:01:45] Yoshi_Squad: you mean doomerfand
[1:01:47] jugdabutcher: in the beginning cops were fun to watch cause it was a lot of action chasing crims... now cops is just paperwork and court, and crims are fun to watch run havoc...
[1:01:47] chivvyy: they should bring u on board 100%
[1:01:47] Wintyer2: you guys goign to have to find there arms stock pile and cut that supply off
[1:01:48] lilCalha: crayOHGOD everything is doomed
[1:01:51] adaa12345678: you also offer solutions not just expressing that it's bad
[1:01:52] snejpen: @KojiMoons annytfHeart
[1:01:52] vicious_pen: idk man.  PD is firing cops faster than they're training them
[1:01:53] geckoguy69: Ask Koil to fix the headaches and publish a better FPS boost guide lol
[1:01:54] icephrogg: whats your plan if cornwood got suspended?
[1:01:57] BSG_Reaper20: But is that your job to do that??
[1:01:57] Johnjoy121: The server has alot of redeeming qualities and additions however the balancing is wrong
[1:01:58] KMGP_Outlaw: no chance PD going to be able to finance itself
[1:01:58] Kaztiell: budgett rp was really fun in 3.0 though, sometiems pd was up good and sometimes down bad depending on mayor
[1:01:59] Croam: You're also talking about No pixel being around for so long tho
[1:02:01] hydropodd: how would you fix the grinding issue
[1:02:02] BaitIHaveUlt: but esfand isn’t in gta whipLaugh
[1:02:02] MackPlays: You gonna buy in like xqc?
[1:02:03] eestr120: somehow all the issues are helping the pd become more powerful
[1:02:03] Pandrax86: have you thought about seeing about options for having a role within NoPixel? even if just an Admin like Moon or Ssaab.
[1:02:04] Lupusdeus: what's an Esfand?
[1:02:05] KMGP_Outlaw: @EsfandTV you ever get reimbursed by PD?
[1:02:06] PsychoJoker: hes talking about the server LUL

[1:02:12] LGHTYRS: Chat, keep up!
[1:02:13] Janman88: the whole approach yes
[1:02:14] HeyMeghan: yeah the 60 days for daps to fall off IS ridiculous. it’s supposed to be fun and content not lets discipline the hell out of this person until their RP is ruined
[1:02:14] TimmayHS: He's talking about NoPixel 4.0 as a whole.
[1:02:15] adaa12345678: it's the economy and server as a whole
[1:02:15] KojiMoons: @snejpen emiruLOVE
[1:02:15] sixoddeight: meta
[1:02:17] Clankoo: its your issue, nobody does crime cause theyre scared to loose money and everything is so hard to get, it takes 1 month to get a pistol
[1:02:18] whysocial: when hornwood ERP arc?
[1:02:18] Wintyer2: this is a whole server issue broader then just PD i get it
[1:02:19] Wadapon: Chat's so confused

[1:02:24] Miterex: Longevity
[1:02:27] chickenwienersoup: what percentage of server is streamers
[1:02:28] Gandalf_the_Mandalf: chat ONLY thinking cops and crims KEK:L
[1:02:29] xMellen: feels like half the server is just grinding
[1:02:29] Real23Phil: the ecosystem
[1:02:30] sh00pz: jesus bro do people know how to form critical thoughts lmao
[1:02:30] ZuldeadTV: but PD gets good content, the thing is, too much downtime doing bad content
[1:02:33] DeliriumTremendous_: council rp is spicy tho especially with the budget fighting
[1:02:33] BelllGoR: its gta there are no real civilians
[1:02:34] Landoram: @EsfandTV  you should speak to Dean and what he's learned about how the economy works (or isn't)
[1:02:35] Amo_Zzz: Chat can't follow a conversation for more than 13 seconds
[1:02:35] DFresh015: server economy
[1:02:38] FoReGz: more rp, less grind
[1:02:38] Fast_doughnut: @jack__burton Yup to much i must make loads of money quickly instead of trying to RP
[1:02:39] Titan_NZ: Locals lives matter YEP
[1:02:39] OILTIME: @EsfandTV You're advocating for them!
[1:02:40] Karter6t: Everything is Crim based on the server and thats what hes talking about
[1:02:41] SteeG: I dont know why in-game people cant be appointed owners for civ jobs. Like if they do a shitty job, its not hard to get rid of them.
[1:02:42] Janman88: NMP could tell u whole bunch for whats NOT going on as Civ LUL
[1:02:42] MackPlays: You're saying they need to add content
[1:02:43] Nozama20: i like it
[1:02:43] bishdaddyfresh_: @EsfandTV Do you ever get a chance to Nopixel devs?
[1:02:44] overnaflash: go gamble
[1:02:45] jeffrey778: they might need to add income tax to all the other jobs to fund the pd i can see that happen as well
[1:02:53] Mikri: @Amo_Zzz true, they are used to 20 second clips LUL
[1:02:53] pizzaplanetXD: the man, the myth, the legend, the corn
[1:02:54] Grumplestillskin: @Aspecticor who gave Canada internet?
[1:02:55] BigglesVII: Majority are getting bored of grinding and RP stories not really picking up.
[1:02:58] Pandrax86: I think you being in a position of influence for NoPixel, even in the background would be a large benefit to the server ecosystem.
[1:03:01] Gandalf_the_Mandalf: the civ RPers want to RP, but they can't because they are FORCED to grind right now
[1:03:02] alimahmood1309: SHOULD LIMIT THE RUNS YOU CAN DO GRIME, GRUPPE 6 ETC
[1:03:03] highspeedpi: Cornwood time to get some bad guys!!!!!!

[1:03:23] mattchutt: facts
[1:03:23] Gandalf_the_Mandalf: YEP 100%
[1:03:23] HeyMeghan: daps should be 30 active days. 1 day on this server feels like a week so I feel like 30 days is still a long time.
[1:03:24] Chrisaroo_: It wasnt going to be perfect out of the box though. Analyze and adjust
[1:03:24] monkz89: holding them back from what? @EsfandTV
[1:03:25] jakqc: Duncaning

[1:03:29] TheLlamaTrainer: DAPs seem like forced drama RP to me. You shouldn’t feel real life anxiety over logging onto a game
[1:03:30] iNF3RNO_ZA: more goals & opportunities and quests
[1:03:31] adaa12345678: it's great RP rather than an automated process
[1:03:31] blahder: There
[1:03:32] spicyville: WICKED
[1:03:34] Gorirras: too much grinding is making the RP suffer
[1:03:35] Scrando: it’s crazy how broke siobhan is when she does so much work, feels like she’s punished for doing good rp
[1:03:35] jburke23: @esfandtv Do you think once people open up their own businesses that might help the overall economy and RP?
[1:03:36] Wintyer2: are all those buisness on there own budget or they state budget still
[1:03:37] Vorpalwarp: get bitches
[1:03:37] cleothax: why do they not want to do things like that though like it would make so much sense
[1:03:38] dawson9999: couldn’t agree more
[1:03:38] jdotno: I think they are going for a fully self sufficient  model

[1:03:40] Smoogol: Aware like irl
[1:03:41] Landoram: radio's quiet
[1:03:41] SteeG: The people who are being "held back" are likely crims trying to do a civ job. So it makes sense to be that way.
[1:03:43] hyyakkiimaruu: it makes sense, and give the managers more incentives to do the job, making it appealing
[1:03:44] MarvMelody: crime Susge archer Susge
[1:03:46] thepeacefulgoon: Cornwood is actually right
[1:03:46] honeybucket1: crime vs pd is the game
[1:03:47] bradzehh: yeah thats true. point taken :)
[1:03:47] Clodhoppr: @Wave_TF sup Tips o7

[1:03:51] daniel01927291: isn’t senior buns kinda like that with managers already @esfandtv or am I wrong
[1:03:52] Kneza007: As time passes, pessimists actually become realists, and optimists become ill-informed utopians
[1:03:52] Iron_Bjorn: @Scrando I agree so muhc
[1:03:52] marczm4n: how does that work for people who can’t get in as freely as you can?
[1:03:55] hectorsalamanca4: hectorsalamanca4 subscribed at Tier 1.

[1:03:59] sixoddeight: then why shut down the out the box thinkers
[1:04:00] khrow: there are like 4 real civ players too, everyone does crime
[1:04:00] jinnytolls: Audi R8 so I can grind without cops catching me in a straight 200mph line @EsfandTV
[1:04:04] God_is_a_cat_girl: I feel like 3.0 businesses were good at first, until they had almost every business belong to 1 corporation, then every civ is like a NPC for a handful of people 4Shrug
[1:04:04] Astavexa: All rp servers ends up being like that, grind money, buy nice car, do crime, then chases. NP needs to avoid that.
[1:04:06] Grumplestillskin: @Aspecticor OMEGALUL you been doin great on the detective <3 keep up the good work

[1:05:09] MrDher: Wait, do you guys pay??
[1:05:09] swatman750: SELF CHECKJOUT even if there is a line
[1:05:09] totogonplays: when the city is empty and there’s no one to interact with it’s boring. make managers for more interaction make drama for hires and fires it’s what RP is meant to be
[1:05:09] mitchgroulx1234: Real put stuff in my bag

[1:05:27] WayILive: any plans to take cornwood off duty more to do some non pd RP a bit
[1:05:28] mclovins1g: Aren't Walmart getting rid of self checkouts because of stealing
[1:05:28] Howenhiem: what ifi just steal everything
[1:05:30] merger3: thats actually a really good analogy
[1:05:32] emery_steele: it doesn't make RP
[1:05:33] lemmytunngainus: @iantenna OuttaPocket
[1:05:35] Canahealz: there is people trying to open stores its just not in game yet which will open RP yes but you have to play what is there i guess
[1:05:36] WeirdWetFart: I run to my tuner car and them swap to 5 bikes
[1:05:39] slight621: Make the RP more equitable.

[1:06:07] bluej255: yup i seen these content unlocks live
[1:06:08] Aspecticor: YEP
[1:06:08] TheKingOfWit: tell the cashier they look good, see if they 'forget' to charge you for something
[1:06:09] eestr120: but people want money how do managers stop people from grinding?
[1:06:10] Raptorious_: true
[1:06:10] mitchgroulx1234: !points
[1:06:11] StreamElements: @mitchgroulx1234 mitchgroulx1234 has 434 RetFuel and is rank 257039/887733 on the leaderboard.
[1:06:11] jeffrey778: i remember thats what adam was doing in game with the snr buns orders path of least resistance
[1:06:11] PanicAtNabisco: Steal the bags leave Walmart to red garage
[1:06:14] WrecklessK: @touchpaduser5678 Exactly
[1:06:15] Raptorious_: this is exactly it YEP
[1:06:15] sh00pz: what he's saying is facts in the context of a rp server
[1:06:16] CuIdra: I see what you're saying now
[1:06:16] RaicoP: mhm
[1:06:16] KelsoSo: The only thing Cornwood investigates is the vending machine you liar
[1:06:18] Valail: How do you fix it?
[1:06:20] 1futrex: Nice Analogy
[1:06:21] Slentley: it has two people put in effort to an interaction, rather than one going solo and being silent to leave asap
[1:06:22] bigpharmaa: laughs in snr buns
[1:06:23] P4K_Little: supp chattt
[1:06:24] PacGamer: yeah that's true
[1:06:24] Ptitjo97: I agree
[1:06:25] RyinTwitch: random helping EMS lead to 8 hours of rp mhm
[1:06:26] sixoddeight: similar to keeping 6' apart
[1:06:27] harbhub: the thing is, its not just the way the jobs are (thats for sure a big part of it), but also a lot of players arent putting in effort to rp even though they could
[1:06:31] Shonuff_: good analogy
[1:06:31] Jnick: you nailed it
[1:06:31] Kelborn: thats actually a really good anology
[1:06:32] mitchgroulx1234: !gamble all
[1:06:33] DeoNone: it does
[1:06:34] Smoogol: Duncaning CHILLS
[1:06:35] 1futrex: It's good
[1:06:35] bradzehh: yh does make sense thanks
[1:06:35] Real23Phil: with a player-owner it gives a position to fight over for rp, but the state can stop it going off the rails
[1:06:36] God_is_a_cat_girl: isn't snr buns almost completely automated? Burgershot being more manual had a lot more RP and fun ideas going on
[1:06:37] hyyakkiimaruu: would corruption be a possible issue with the manager positions
[1:06:38] eyeoin: but that analogy kind of proved we want the self check-out
[1:06:38] Cabbagepatchclown_: Duncaning
[1:06:39] iMarks: i dont think thats a fix they can do in 4.0 maybe in 5.0
[1:06:40] Dee__1__: they tried that in 3.0, 2.0 and 1.0
[1:06:40] dapyman: Makes sense
[1:06:40] Aspecticor: OMEGALUL
[1:06:40] EshaneDharmaPunx: You can't barcode scam in the teller line tho...
[1:06:40] sh00pz: it made complete sense it was a good analogy
[1:06:44] TheKingOfWit: @EsfandTV it's also why they turn off Dr K, so people RP with docs
[1:06:44] chivvyy: yea its clear, they need to listen to u
[1:06:46] Wireless_AeON: the best is when people just tell you stuff when you dont ask
[1:06:46] mizkifsrecedinghairline: It's the difference between Senior Buns and Group 6
[1:06:47] Ptitjo97: There is no management it's just go to place and earn cash
[1:06:48] tailon2k: makes sense yeah
[1:06:48] PeculiarEboy: it almost sounds like a union town mentality
[1:06:48] DirtyDulay: that makes sense
[1:06:48] CuIdra: No need to now explain through an interpreted dance, but would be welcomed.
[1:06:49] Atrickee_: my adhd ass just watched the same esfand short about 300 times NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[1:06:49] Thraxton1: It's actually a good analogy
[1:06:49] Exaviot: Self checkout? Oh wow dungeon finder
[1:06:50] rhaziaa: Lots of sense, great anal
[1:06:51] driver1036: Why not tell koil this
[1:06:51] Yopimarus: they still do the jobs with other people, and the whitelist thing would not change the job itself.
[1:06:51] harbhub: like cornwood goes out of his way to create rp even when there are easy paths to avoid it
[1:06:51] wavy__________________: Duncan would be proud
[1:06:52] sixoddeight: the people united will never be defeated so they keep us seperated
[1:06:53] the_bucket_plays: esfand is powergaming by explaining this
[1:06:55] whysocial: corruption = RP
[1:06:56] mizuluhta: it also punishes the streamers that want to do other things besides nopixel because they can't or don't want to grind to get money all day
[1:06:56] rohnj: RP
[1:06:57] creamreaper: Are we paying with cash or credit
[1:06:58] rohnj: YEP
[1:06:59] XPixelartX: Is the radio dead?
[1:07:00] Banana_Pizza_Enjoyer: corruption is rp
[1:07:00] prefixqc: even simple job interviews as opposite to SignIn would enable sh*t ton RP
[1:07:02] 1futrex: There's always corruption AAAA
[1:07:02] dylanconlon6: I agree however say if u have a proper manager and their mate kills someone will they fire them when they should that would have to be made clear
[1:07:05] highspeedpi: Sandwich good
[1:07:05] bluej255: mutany
[1:07:06] Republic_of_texas: or the places where you grab $950 worth of stuff and leave
[1:07:07] iNF3RNO_ZA: nopixel needs achievements & badges for prestige bitches like rewards
[1:07:07] ClassifiedGnar: Is the cashier hot tho?
[1:07:07] walkgleesh: YEP
[1:07:08] Doqx42: Civs are just locals that you have to stop for when you run them over right now lol
[1:07:09] docterstrange_: is there a acedemy today
[1:07:10] marczm4n: but the hr rp in the pd last week was such a bore
[1:07:12] Clodhoppr: RP massive bust on the corruption HUYGE
[1:07:13] dapyman: Ruth is a prime example of that hate management
[1:07:14] magichuuu: yea,, being civ require more interaction than grinding g6 or garbage
[1:07:14] xl_scout_lx: Crims have to go to a walmart with 1 check out open with the self checkout not working
[1:07:14] Ptitjo97: FirstTimeChatter
[1:07:15] Kawika219: they do address it a little by incentivizing people to do jobs together and not alone.
[1:07:16] snowdrako: Exactly that's why I liked when speedy was running Snr buns
[1:07:16] zoldattv: Looking
[1:07:16] ChocolateMassage: cop stacking shift 1 Classic
[1:07:17] philmagroin1: like I said the only faction in RP servers that have to RP are cops
[1:07:18] ZMaster92: But then my streamer doesnt win all the time
[1:07:18] Sulm: That's exactly what shelly did with burgershot isnt it? that's still content
[1:07:21] Mikri: @iMarks yeah that sounds like a conversation before release not during
[1:07:21] tailon2k: FirstTimeChatter
[1:07:21] harbhub: @ClassifiedGnar asking the real questions
[1:07:22] SteeG: Civ jobs need genuine owners If they're shit its easy for the gov to remove them. At least try it.
[1:07:22] chrisbetwoshiesty: why dont you have a charger or anything your still stuck in a vic?
[1:07:23] 1CaptainRedBeard1: They are extremely anti-corruption this time around. From an OOC perspective.
[1:07:24] Flandlevine: nope you're wrong, dumb take #averageRPviewer
[1:07:24] Kaztiell: but those who get managers dont wanna lose their job ever, just like anyone else, that was the prob in 3.0
[1:07:25] paneja28: FirstTimeChatter
[1:07:27] benjono_c8: @ClassifiedGnar FeelsWeirdMan
[1:07:27] sSnapZz: @ClassifiedGnar thats the ultimate question right there
[1:07:32] WrecklessK: FirstTimeChatter
[1:07:32] bluej255: undercover boss lol
[1:07:33] spartacus1j: @EsfandTV But when you have the cashier lane analogy, people can easily gatekeep smaller members or outcasts of the community. Bully the little guy, you need both lanes to work

[1:07:45] humanhere2: As long as that "manager" can ALSO be fired and replaced, I think it's a good idea.  I think previously, the WL for business before didn't ever face the risk of LOSING that business or whatever...

[1:08:05] wavy__________________: Jay Son Pole Am?
[1:08:07] marneraiders: But the problem I am seeing with Snr buns ( a place where people talk to get something) that there is such an intensity of only a certain RP (crime)

[1:08:45] guilt_: Of course that's your contention. You're a first year grad student. You just finished some Marxian historian, Pete Garrison prob'ly, and so naturally that's what you believe until next month when you get to James Lemon and get convinced that Virginia and Pennsylvania were strongly entrepreneurial and capitalist back in 1740. That'll last until sometime in your second year, then you'll be in here regurgitating Gordon Wood about the Pre-revolutionary utopia.

[1:50:25] Shmoopee: I mean I'm a dev and that's a great idea.
[1:50:27] slothparty: future business licenses?
[1:50:29] Mic_Stargazer: Sunny is the manager 4Weird
[1:50:29] LogicWeasel: and Mosley's
[1:50:31] jev2017: i think the senior buns was just so there's a job available from the jump
[1:50:31] Vlasvilneous: manager would hinge on them being around.
[1:50:33] Vestfolding: Bro what are you waffling about
[1:50:33] Panos_97: @EsfandTV Power Tripping is a likely issue
[1:50:34] suoicil: gatekeeping
[1:50:35] Clodhoppr: as long as its someone who has no issues taking L's
[1:50:36] JO3Y_C: The G6 Situation means even more crims on the street and not enough PD
[1:50:36] inKPotatomancer: devs want more control?
[1:50:37] SecretChiley: Snr buns already has managers
[1:50:37] jbc_inc: People don't like accountability
[1:50:37] Bhasgreth: would need multiple managers for each shift
[1:50:38] Ancor_: it creates a barrier to entry
[1:50:38] Vlasvilneous: yeah, gatekeeping
[1:50:39] remaulo: gatekeeping
[1:50:41] Kaztiell: cause ppl didnt wanna lose ther job when they got in jail, just like cops dont wanna get fired @EsfandTV
[1:50:41] cyanwarrior5: Gatekeeping
[1:50:43] davideil: I'm not a Dev but im also a dev and I have no opinon
[1:50:49] Grimzzly3D: well technically the manager has to grind to do the job, they cant just stand around and talk all day
[1:50:49] Janman88: is the police gatekept? yes so what
[1:50:52] Zendorea: moon HATES gatekeeping
[1:50:53] bluej255: cry babies
[1:50:54] Leafyerick: @EsfandTV Because it's too reliant on that person logging in and doing a job and then someone has to manage the manager
[1:50:54] SmugPls: Clique-y, but honestly early burgershot felt nice. It felt cohesive
[1:50:55] BaitIHaveUlt: frygate whipS
[1:50:56] Khaosshinobi: gatekeeping and the managers doing crime and not getting caught and abusing the system
[1:50:56] PoisonDart11: the server is already arguably gatekept so who cares kekw
[1:50:57] gage7007: there were ppl playing favorites
[1:51:00] RobialT: The problem is the Managers become corrupt
[1:51:03] WeirdWetFart: Any confrontation would be assumed gatekeeping
[1:51:04] bobdang07hd: can’t be holding grinders back that would be the end of the world so many people crying
[1:51:06] joyofjackal: this is more like a podcast than an rp stream
[1:51:07] SarahFlare: a leader yes but someone with “absolute power” no.
[1:51:07] kylef_: mhm
[1:51:08] permacool: @EsfandTV the only problem with having a sole managerial spot is absence dur to real life reasons impacting the flow of RP in game due to unaccessable features
[1:51:08] raphi__9: but you would need to make sure, the manager is always online
[1:51:09] jev2017: In 3.0 the RP i had while trying to get a job at burger shot was phenomenal lol, there should def be managers
[1:51:10] Cabbagepatchclown_: @RobialT, ya but thats good rp
[1:51:23] Janman88: would u really argue that the PD is gatekept ?! @EsfandTV
[1:51:28] Shmoopee: I think. when people start opening shops and branching out that might happen naturally @esfandtv
[1:51:30] imSteffin: There has to be a way to dethrone the manager without it being accessible / viable for trolls but also open enough for the current employees to be able to use.
[1:51:30] Torcheee: Kevin Whipaloo should return
[1:51:31] psych_low: An admin should manage it
[1:51:33] VincentsDeath: like an admin or dev would be good
[1:51:34] Mic_Stargazer: Sunny and others do that at SNr. Buns all the time tbh
[1:51:35] codeoftheplayground: Managers help to establish standards.
[1:51:35] Ancor_: managers also can't be on 24/7
[1:51:39] Im_a_sad_panda: there needs to be someone with control but the position should be a ooc non corruptible position like I believe treasurer is
[1:51:44] sirsalem13: who will manage the managers?
[1:51:46] SecretChiley: It would be fun if G6 and snr buns had a budget and all of those had CEOs who try their best to manage that budget by hiring and firing people
[1:51:46] bobdang07hd: City needs a Shelly again
[1:51:48] JO3Y_C: With it as is.. G6 gonna be robbed more and there are more crims gonna be fighting crims.. Minimal actual RP improvement.
[1:51:52] angus1794: gatekeeping is good in this kind of server isn't it?
[1:51:53] itWyrm: PD has to be gatekept
[1:51:53] Torcheee: @Ancor_ shift managers
[1:51:53] permacool: Yeah its gatekept to the point where if someone gets in, its always on a streamer privledge at this point
[1:51:54] Atrix646: only the best at pd EZ
[1:51:55] notdustinx: why wouldn’t they want more cops ?
[1:51:55] Karter6t: when is no turbo day?
[1:52:00] LogicWeasel: mhm  people need leadership
[1:52:00] chunce0: i think their goal was to have a legal food job while implementing personal ownered later so there always a fall back. they need reasons to keep working at places.
[1:52:02] Reddevc: KKaren I'm the manager
[1:52:03] permacool: PD is streamer prio and that needs to change @EsfandTV
[1:52:05] Kaztiell: ppl will make their own buissness that will have managers etc soon wont they? @EsfandTV
[1:52:05] yunggleasy: Like Kevin Whipaloo and the winery, lol
[1:52:08] Joongi_: SUNNY FOR SNR BUNS MANAGER Drake SUNNY FOR SNR BUNS MANAGER Drake SUNNY FOR SNR BUNS MANAGER Drake SUNNY FOR SNR BUNS MANAGER Drake SUNNY FOR SNR BUNS MANAGER Drake SUNNY FOR SNR BUNS MANAGER Drake SUNNY FOR SNR BUNS MANAGER Drake SUNNY FOR SNR BUNS MANAGER Drake
[1:52:08] Toastedgamer03: best way to become a cop is to have 15k viewers average KEKW
[1:52:09] Sadisticmedic: when Soda pop was the Mgt it was fun
[1:52:11] EPiQ: tbh, that was one of the major rifts between ONX and NoPixel devs...Nopixel wanted game mechanics, ONX wanted RP
[1:52:12] Janman88: if the manager has no power its lame
[1:52:12] LogicWeasel: leadership shouldn't be a time card machine.
[1:52:15] sladeet17: nidas did amazing at Pdm
[1:52:16] Fabushki: and they dont have tho
[1:52:19] sendu6666: I remember today everyone gets new cars?
[1:52:19] Maz0hyst: @Shmoopee NP needs player ran businesses already. Instead of just Snr Buns / Mosleys. Opens up a ton of good RP NODDERS
[1:52:19] Tengokuuu: I think it's fair that PD is gatekept to a certain extent, they have a big impact on other's roleplaying experience
[1:52:23] MariKatari: does Shelly still play chat?
[1:52:24] Mic_Stargazer: Yeah that happens a lot, most people respect the decision but you get some shitters
[1:52:25] KMGP_Outlaw: and no real consequences
[1:52:25] Khaosshinobi: @permacool LULW the whole server is streamer priv
[1:52:25] Grimnaer: PD should be gatkept to an extent. It's a tough RP role, you have to learn a lot. Some people don't want to put in that work to learn it.
[1:52:31] Tsilin: I think that is fine with private business. I think gov business should have a lower barrier.

[1:53:04] joalona: didn't X try to manage there too?
[1:53:06] SlimTDC: I dont think that was cause they wanted air time on his stream for the most part. I think it's cause he was funny af to interact with
[1:53:06] chunce0: content trickles a prob also people flock to newest stuff
[1:53:06] SteeG: I said this earlier. DW owned burger shot for most of 3.0, he just appointed civ manager and it worked fine.
[1:53:07] Mic_Stargazer: I've noticed a few "questgiver" types that liek to facilitate it so it could be a good position for older RPers who just want to help out

[1:53:24] Atrix646: TheIlluminati ?
[1:53:25] suoicil: cg viewers
[1:53:26] AndreSays: he took it a little far yea
[1:53:27] Whiezy: accountability
[1:53:28] permacool: @Atrix646 not in writing, but it effectively became so due to the lack of FTO's and availability
[1:53:28] LogicWeasel: yeah, Ramee played that up for his take
[1:53:29] eqnjn: The narrative makes good RP
[1:53:29] PoisonDart11: people still crying about Johnson kekw
[1:53:32] Janman88: everyone beeing able to g6 doesnt make sense tho, if we talk about NP beeing more realistic
[1:53:32] sladeet17: nidas always had mangers that promoted RP over everything

[1:53:36] Maz0hyst: @permacool Takes time and $ since after a dew days you can't even app unless you pay
[1:53:37] mizkifsrecedinghairline: It's fine until they try to start bringing race into it, then it gets weird.
[1:53:38] tinywulf: targeted or not he is missed
[1:53:39] SacarioE: It's some good RP
[1:53:40] Fabushki: its dumb that he was targetted yeah
[1:53:41] AndreSays: yea he didn't take an responsibility
[1:53:46] Maz0hyst: few*
[1:53:46] itou_eight: I DON'T RECALL
[1:53:53] TimmayHS: The REAL travesty is Den getting 1 dap from Ruth for pitting after he was TOLD TO PIT @EsfandTV
[1:53:54] redrum359: i feel like johnson and shiesty being dropped was valid
[1:53:55] tellos0: Johnson was not targetted at all
[1:53:56] Whiezy: accountable
[1:53:58] Kaztiell: @SteeG it wasnt for most of 3.0, he gave it away early when he started cerberus with Buddah
[1:53:58] EPiQ: @DrWetbone That's the thing. NoPIxel was built on people standing around "making believe" without the need for game mechanics.
[1:53:58] TheLlamaTrainer: Johnson played that entire situation so badly
[1:54:03] kylef_: i don't recall LULW
[1:54:07] n0oxaskek: i never do something wrong :)
[1:54:09] KingJayClouted: huh
[1:54:14] tellos0: Slacks gave him plenty of time to come clean
[1:54:15] xseaka: he coulda had a great redemption arc, start a private security job for a while or something
[1:54:15] chopsuey84: @esfandtv  u still working out?
[1:54:16] Khaosshinobi: he's playing the victim the entire time NODDERS
[1:54:17] RobialT: I watched the whole thing and Johnson aboslutely got screwed over. He admitted his mistakes and said he doesnt remeber stuff they said he did but it never happened like them telling him to stop. Remeber when Cornwwod was accused of aiming his gun at a crowd?
[1:54:17] Reddevc: gachiBASS take it boy
[1:54:17] chunce0: I think alot of people see both sides but it seems like some conversations are target with the way things are worded. Making officers defensive.
[1:54:18] Stagnation: @permacool that's a lie lol. the "Chestanisberg" character isn't a big streamer at all, and the vast majority of people aren't either. it's difficult to get in because there aren't many places to begin with, but being popular does help.
[1:54:18] Thraxton1: I think people actually beleive the shit that Ramee and K (the characters) are saying and that's so dumb KEKW
[1:54:18] SarahFlare: but screaming about it def not a way to approach it
[1:54:19] AndreSays: saying you don't recall instead of saying I shouldn't have said that and I apologize i'll do better @EsfandTV would have saved him
[1:54:20] permacool: @permacool yeah completely true, but theres a chance. with the pd, youre not gonna get that shit read unless you have someone say "hey, hire that guy" and everyone in those positions are streamers rn
[1:54:21] kylef_: essaying holy
[1:54:22] Mic_Stargazer: he got liek 2 daps for that, Slacks legit opened the report
[1:54:25] qorzzz: Slacks gaslit the fuck outta him though for real for real on g
[1:54:25] MoohamedAlii: yeah that what Den did
[1:54:28] imSteffin: essaying
[1:54:31] Joffy__: DinkDonk give it up for day __ of johnson stuff
[1:54:32] imSteffin: this is when i dip
[1:54:32] Wintyer2: He got Fired Cause he Lied about what happened
[1:54:33] Janman88: Johnson had every opportunity to take the L and move on but he kept digging
[1:54:35] BigglesVII: He didnt, he got fired for how he handled the aftermath
[1:54:35] Alkemiee: @redrum359 shiesty wasnt dropped
[1:54:37] joewelch29: he got fired for lieing
[1:54:38] tellos0: he was not fired because he hit Mr K, btw
[1:54:39] KojiMoons: There's so much essaying
[1:54:41] imSteffin: im watching tho SeemsGood
[1:54:45] LogicWeasel: he fucked up his convo with slacks twice.
[1:54:46] Amo_Zzz: Johnson was the one building that narrative
[1:54:47] VincentsDeath: has Cornwood talked with Nekoda about LASO yet?
[1:54:49] TheRealTweex: What he did at PD yesterday during the raid on him didn't help him
[1:54:49] madhatterui: he beat mr k unconscious
[1:54:50] DrWetbone: some people don’t ever admit when they are wrong
[1:54:51] sixoddeight: cornwood has punched so many people but i guess not in a aggro cop way
[1:54:51] permacool: @permacool I just think its too big of a gap and too unreliable compared to being popular if that makes sense
[1:54:51] Najb0lji: did Brian get fired?
[1:54:54] r3d_hoodd: Who?
[1:54:54] AndreSays: yea he deflected responsibility
[1:54:55] HeyMeghan: if you did you’d see just how valid it was. he took no accountability then blamed Ruby all while screaming at them both. that’s the TLDR.
[1:54:56] totogonplays: did cornwood get a dap for shooting the guy a bunch of times
[1:54:59] RobialT: He was fired casue the other 2 cops said someething happened that didnt happen and he said he didnt remember
[1:54:59] LogicWeasel: He failed his argument check with slacks. simple as
[1:55:00] Atrix646: @permacool its cuz streamers have prio,it is wat it is right
[1:55:00] Mindhysteria: he double down on slacks simple as that
[1:55:02] xseaka: he coulda had a great redemption arc, start a private security job for a while or something.
[1:55:03] 1CaptainRedBeard1: He brought it on himself in the end
[1:55:04] OddSwizzle: johnson was really disrespectful imho
[1:55:04] Zendorea: Clash of RP personalities
[1:55:05] KingJayClouted: how were things handled ?
[1:55:06] allendork: how he handled the situation with slacks and ruby was extremely poor and didn't do himself any favors honestly
[1:55:06] KMGP_Outlaw: and he's quadrupled down now
[1:55:10] jd2881: He actually told Slacks he didn't know he wasn't allowed to buy guns outside of PD. Like that's a pretty big thing to just forget.
[1:55:10] Wintyer2: @Najb0lji no he probly going to get a few Daps though

[1:55:15] qorzzz: How is anyone going to say he got fired for what he did AFTER getting fired?? wtf
[1:55:17] adaa12345678: it seems like he got fired for doubling down
[1:55:17] Mic_Stargazer: The situation was really bad all around. Everyone involved misremembered the situation to a degree
[1:55:18] tellos0: but in all fairness, it was good rp
[1:55:18] PoisonDart11: he was only supposed to be suspended, then he doubled down yeah?
[1:55:19] afroakatsuki: but the thing is right after he gets shot under the bridge
[1:55:19] bobdang07hd: @najb0lji lmao why would Brian get fired he doesn’t even have a dap yet I don’t think

[2:00:47] eqnjn: Bro it's not even worth the effort to try and make him a cop. Just make a new PD char, Saabb even said to do that
[2:00:50] bigmoula123: Life
[2:00:50] d_o_g_o_: @quaylewastaken he wasnt telling the truth, he left alot out of the story and his attitude towards a captain was awful

[2:02:33] bazzela: You don't have to
[2:02:33] Mr_Jaffs: HUH Why?
[2:02:34] lunatick113: lunatick113 subscribed with Prime.

[2:02:38] Mic_Stargazer: go look at my house by the lake HYPERYump
[2:02:38] bigdanthegoodsir: wouldnt it just be bad for pd to fire him?
[2:02:39] xalvadore: That seems silly
[2:02:39] Bushwick78: Dude drink some water
[2:02:40] Nkz3: WE WANT ACTION
[2:02:40] mininni94: budgets, command, vehicle setups, cornwood knows everything

[2:02:45] bazzela: naaah you dont have to og
[2:02:45] jbc_inc: ??
[2:02:45] Athbreith: Mob Boss Cornwood Season 2 Arc Confirmed? POGGING !?
[2:02:46] sixoddeight: alright lock in cornwood. lets rp
[2:02:46] jessielight: Cornwood would have to be a lawyer or doctor
[2:02:48] AlvinMamba: damn thats hella challenging
[2:02:49] CrystalDimension: @EsfandTV not necessarily
[2:02:49] AlexNabb: Would be fun if you where a bad criminal for a week
[2:02:50] Zakuras: Unless you acted as a secret mafia boss with insiders in the forces
[2:02:51] nutsforbuckss: he doubling down lmao
[2:02:51] Bushwick78: @EsfandTV WATER
[2:02:52] bobdang07hd: @heymeghan he got prio for good content/Rp that created a story. nice try with the garbage comment though
[2:02:52] Nkz3: im getting dizzy
[2:02:54] earthquake_mike: Dirty cops in real life all the time
[2:02:55] itz_ollie7: is that bike quick
[2:02:55] Janizki_Fin: @PoisonDart11 Cornwood Judge arc would be next.
[2:02:56] God_is_a_cat_girl: and forget is just lame RP 4Shrug
[2:02:57] bigdanthegoodsir: that would be pds fault?
[2:02:58] bazzela: it happened before tho LUL
[2:03:01] TheMah1337: rp that they wiped your memory type thing
[2:03:03] KappaManJason: kyle became a crim he used all the information
[2:03:05] RobialT: Would Cornwood be fired for covering up the Penny shooting?
[2:03:09] Wintyer2: I dont think Cornwood become Crime I could see cornwood as a Private Investigater though
[2:03:09] sleepgoat: kinda like ramee doubling as crim and lawyer?
[2:03:09] UA_Shark: Rammi is in chain gang? lepS
[2:03:11] hoanzlgoas: cornwood is the greatest danger for the pd right now, they cant fire him because than they would need to pay him out and go bankrupt LUL
[2:03:13] jbc_inc: That doesn't seem realistic to me, how would an ex cop not use his knowledge if he went crim irl
[2:03:15] Lucsvm: Johnson PepeLaugh
[2:03:15] imSteffin: Cornwood would know how to meta the cars to be god tier vs cop cars OMEGALUL
[2:03:15] Mic_Stargazer: The Ramee stuff is so good lol
[2:03:16] Bushwick78: @EsfandTV Drink some water dude
[2:03:16] moomanji: CORNMAN vigilante arc
[2:03:19] d_o_g_o_: @d_o_g_o_ what was wrong about them? Also the fight with Mr K wasnt even what got him fired
[2:03:21] AndreSays: @EsfandTV do you think Johnson's situation directly dealing with Mr K is much different then you dumping 2+ mags into someone?
[2:03:23] thewarth0g: johnson should joint chang gang cops pushed him out
[2:03:23] PoisonDart11: @janizki_fin yeah that’s the perfect plan if he does get fired, but I don’t think he will
[2:03:24] Archangel3003: All the people asking why confuse me. Do you not understand that the character would not know all that information.
[2:03:26] Zendorea: PD is the Moderators for the Server
[2:03:27] Kaztiell: kyle pred joined a gang in 3.0 i
[2:03:27] Winttyrr: yuou are not explaining it very well
[2:03:28] CrystalDimension: which is rp as well @EsfandTV
[2:03:29] PandaNomsBamboo: i still like judge cornwood idea or vigilante again
[2:03:32] davidrw2691: is bonnie comming back? there has been talk off cutting people who are not comming on shift
[2:03:32] Athbreith: Judge Cornwood would be amazing
[2:03:32] Kalious78: isnt\wasnt andrews in cg esfandtv ?
[2:03:35] knowlightnofear: Which is what he's doing with Johnson
[2:03:35] SirUrbanBourbon: CORNING HOLE
[2:03:35] Winttyrr: i dont get what youre trying to day
[2:03:35] shramtots: - all turbos if fired
[2:03:36] lewisfoulger456: How come you driving around on a bike
[2:03:36] Atrix646: undercover crim lawyer is such an advantage
[2:03:41] eqnjn: Make it sound like Ramee hasn't played cop before, it's all pretty simple
[2:03:41] Bushwick78: @EsfandTV WATER
[2:03:43] LogicWeasel: the cars already are god tier vs pd cars.  pd cars suck ass
[2:03:46] lewisfoulger456: We going to do some work
[2:03:46] polarhehexd: you'd still go through the windshield somehow
[2:03:47] dains84: but at the same token, the higher ups @ PD should know that and lean to not firing you.  its a double edge sword for them as well.
[2:03:48] Adorablexo_: Not with Cornwood driving ICANT
[2:03:48] TheLadyCupcake: except if cornwood was driving LULW
[2:03:49] AndreSays: @EsfandTV honest question do you think Johnson's situation directly dealing with Mr K is much different then you dumping 2+ mags into someone?
[2:03:50] qorzzz: get away as long as cornwood aint driving LUL
[2:03:50] Elmatron97: they already do LUL
[2:03:50] MarvinOGravel: As long as Cornwood is just a passenger and not driving
[2:03:51] itou_eight: Crims already know bikes are invincible though
[2:03:51] Leafyerick: @Kalious78 Andrews was an honorary member
[2:03:52] shramtots: if get Suspened take all turbos
[2:03:53] xx_bor1qua_xx: he was a cop in 3.0 he was a ranger
[2:03:53] DeoNone: that's why ramee wanted johnson on a crim side
[2:03:53] Scrando: crim coach cornwood esfandCOPS
[2:03:54] remaulo: copium
[2:03:56] neovexan: did Ripley leave NoPixel?
[2:03:57] KissItAndWink: Cornwood amnesia crim arc???
[2:03:58] ZachFromChat: cornwood knows how they will react to every scenario lol
[2:03:58] God_is_a_cat_girl: but that would just be PD's fault anyway LULW
[2:04:01] StormiNyan: peepoShy hayes
[2:04:04] Zakuras: Cornwood would be the corrupted cop that became a crim because the world needs MORE justice
[2:04:09] mensrea123: LUL current crims always get away already
[2:04:10] RebornOffline: Cornwood knows all the procedures and how basicly everything works, going around stuff would be too easy for him
[2:04:10] PewbesSalad: ithink people take rp to seriously
[2:04:12] Kaisenjin: @eqnjn The character don't know the meta dude
[2:04:13] CrystalDimension: but using that knowledge is rp as well @EsfandTV
[2:04:16] Alkemiee: perhaps that's what cornwood would do, but dosent mean others need to follow the 'forget' idea
[2:04:16] Adorablexo_: join the chase
[2:04:16] ZachFromChat: its kind of OP info
[2:04:18] jasminewoah: From an audience perspective if everyone knew everything it would be boring TRUEING
[2:04:18] FeeD_z_DeaTh: so no sandy station yet ?

[2:04:20] StreamElements: Printed Cases, Platelights, and Platelight panels have landed! 🌠starforgepc.com/Esfand
[2:04:21] hoanzlgoas: PD cant allow it to get Cornwood fired, they owe him too much money and all turbos would be gone
[2:04:24] Fabushki: ???????????
[2:04:24] RietArtwork: go with bike, yesss
[2:04:27] Maz0hyst: If Cornwood got fired from PD they'd be fucked. Cornwood is to big of an assest and knows more about everything PD I'd say, crims would be eating good.
[2:04:31] sterred: @EsfandTV Are the lockpicks you have PD issued?
[2:04:32] jd2881: Would be hilarious if a senior was just watching Cornwoods blip. Just circles around the little Alamo for 10 minutes.
[2:04:33] StormiNyan: helmet modCheck
[2:04:33] grlgunk: chat,any denzel update??

[3:50:41] Michaelrocks9: Tang
[3:50:41] SmugPls: The towtruck was a rp stopper eith people on top stopping you from pitting or spiking because of safety
[3:50:41] Xierany: I might have missed something but feel like you haven't gotten anyone since robberies came out
[3:50:42] Gindberk: How does cops catch criminals in the current set up, does seem with the SOPs and how sturdy cars are that crims need to fuck up real bad to get caught?
[3:50:45] BumbleFumbleLord: the durability is a huge issue, cop cars can't stand up and it makes cops hesitant to box and pit in some cases
[3:50:46] Eco02: Just pop em, can't run away if they ain't breathing
[3:50:48] JimothyWon: the car was able to ram the cop cars with 0 momentum LUL

[3:50:54] Winttyrr: i mean, if they got out of the box, then it wasnt a perfect box
[3:50:54] Vikairius: The boxes and highway blasting are dumb. The planned ones like this is skill based imo
[3:50:55] simply_soggyy: to be fair they had a creative plan with the tow truck and the construction jump
[3:50:56] Chaoszero_goc: @inz4ne_ they have to catch him red handed

[3:50:59] marczm4n: yo @esfandtv do you do any APA events?
[3:51:00] DaymanF0TNM: and to get a SINGLE crim in cuffs, you gotta cuff usually 5+ times
[3:51:03] BelllGoR: @harbhub there used to be like 100 cops per shift so it wasn't as big a deal
[3:51:04] bertacharm: Lil mistakes decided this one
[3:51:04] playswitsquirrel: i think cops just got outplayed, got lost in the hills way too easy
[3:51:06] davidduccck: @EsfandTV moon did say he wants to get rid of bikes which was his biggest issue
[3:51:06] quixan_: That one was ...ok

[3:51:07] jeffrey778: on the perfect box
[3:51:09] ChippieChad: to be fair both crim drivers were very good in this one
[3:51:09] PsychoJoker: I think they said no EMS you gotta drive him yourself
[3:51:10] taffletv: they also planned this decently well
[3:51:11] pepedoot: they lost you all legit in the hills
[3:51:16] KMGP_Outlaw: crims shouldn't be able to break cuffs so easily
[3:51:19] daedayz: eh mcnulty was on that red car. just made a mistake with one call
[3:51:19] jd2881: Dumb question but you can't do anything about knowing it was Mr. K car? Obviously you can't prove he's in it but if the same car appears at multiple chases there has to some penalty.
[3:51:20] Ancor_: call ems again
[3:51:21] lehmanb: I mean atleast there doing unique stuff instead of the same ole shit
[3:51:23] creamycaesar: atleast the crims are coming up with interesting plans for escape
[3:51:25] aboomah: does anyone know if someone got one of the things they were throwing at them?
[3:51:28] UnthinkablePresent: ask for ems statuws
[3:51:28] MoohamedAlii: Yeah PD needs Air1
[3:51:28] driver1036: Chase them then cuff them 8 times
[3:51:30] sevenevilmuffins: ive always felt like most crims should admit defeat at one point for the RP. Like when you have them full boxed
[3:51:32] quixan_: as mentioned I'm under the impression the crims also don't get much out of that one
[3:51:35] fishmeatx: the cop punishments should be harder then or they have to fix so much
[3:51:35] pepedoot: air 1
[3:51:38] Inz4ne_: @Chaoszero_goc I know but there was this one chase last night where he went to hide in vault and slacks/saab realised its him so he didnt really look for him
[3:51:39] CrutonArt: cops are so under balanced. you guys lose 4v1 chases 90% of the time
[3:51:39] Michaelrocks9: Urus to urus
[3:51:39] pepedoot: is needed
[3:51:41] playswitsquirrel: honestly hills is all about covering in parallel
[3:51:41] Republic_of_texas: there would have been no way IRL where those guys would have been standing on the tow truck to jump over the wall
[3:51:42] dudemanbroo: you need buffalos
[3:51:43] thebigshabam: tbf the time period this game was made the cars are pretty period correct
[3:51:44] LogicWeasel: why do the devs leave cops so badly nerfed?? @EsfandTV  󠀀
[3:51:45] dmb____: good variety of escapes
[3:51:46] Wetidiot: they dont even need plans they can just outdrive normally
[3:51:47] bertacharm: You'd fall off
[3:51:48] PentaGoblin: you could?
[3:51:49] pepedoot: air1 is needed lol
[3:51:50] itWyrm: you could
[3:51:51] aguy02: did anyone go back to collect the stuff they threw at you guys for DNA? @EsfandTV
[3:51:51] Fast_doughnut: Mcnulty just got unlucky with the locals in that chase was keeping up with them
[3:51:52] YoshiTheDeeno: @EsfandTV when is payday?
[3:51:52] Sanivay: What aout the masks?
[3:51:54] Thraxton1: EMS is not coming what are you waiting for LUL
[3:51:56] RobialT: Have PD stopped a single robbery yet?
[3:51:56] yippyip: at 80 tho
[3:51:57] razakirin: with all the money and time they spent of course they should have a slight advantage
[3:51:59] morflame: Should there be a reasonable capture rule. like if you guys hit X Y and Z then they shoul just surrener?
[3:52:00] SonRusso: LSPD Funding modCheck
[3:52:02] enfranchise_: CAnt you DNA them still?
[3:52:03] josebellgaming: @EsfandTV 100 checking on EMS? Officer down
[3:52:03] DeathDefier: they planned their route around lag spikes that would knock them off
[3:52:04] jessielight: it makes it interesting when they do stuff like that
[3:52:05] Techno_Plumber: ems not coming......
[3:52:05] x_Gordo: tbf that red car only goes 105
[3:52:06] Michaelrocks9: Stare
[3:52:06] chaosproductions: McNulty Bike Spike
[3:52:07] daedayz: eh mcnulty was on that red car. just made a mistake with one call for someone to hold right instead of left
[3:52:07] heavyd834: it's not fair that cops are expected to have realistic RP limitations whereas crims can just car hop and force their way out of boxes etc.
[3:52:08] w111iam1: So if crims are boxing a cop down can they use baton? Cause I hardly see batons being used
[3:52:09] ihhunt3r: you could but it was 50/50 if you fell off
[3:52:10] b2a80: you would just need to dance or something
[3:52:10] imSteffin: I think you need to ems check.
[3:52:11] Berserake: Only at the end you couild
[3:52:11] PentaGoblin: https://clips.twitch.tv/CautiousShortSaladDxAbomb-936219_LkVaYngmq
[3:52:12] Dicejr7: streamer never wrong
[3:52:13] Dugnis: The car swaps and breaking cuffs a million times feels pretty terrible for rp
[3:52:13] Zhang_1888: same strat was done in 3.0
[3:52:14] marlz365: CG deffo did that in 3.0
[3:52:16] Downbag: Mr. K always finds the cheesiest ways to escape
[3:52:18] itWyrm: I dont think EMS is coming PepeLaugh
[3:52:20] LoudPackNoReefa: yea ppl just didnt use tow trucks as much in 3.0
[3:52:21] numblezzz: @LogicWeasel lots of drama in the past with criminals getting tilted, then their viewers harass people
[3:52:21] Drackaine: cops should get a DAP for every criminal that escapes tbh...... MEGALUL
[3:52:22] MoohamedAlii: Did you call EMS
[3:52:22] KMGP_Outlaw: what's the PD catch %?  Like 15%?
[3:52:25] seahorse_kisses: did you ID any vehicles ?
[3:52:26] AbeFroman2: modCheck
[3:52:26] leviathan297: still on 3?
[3:52:27] Vlasvilneous: should be a probability of falling off though
[3:52:27] imSteffin: I'm pretty sure they're on a diff channel.
[3:52:29] Gurch: pepe9561 doubt it will come out before fleeca robberies but could be wrong
[3:52:29] phennex84: Any reason not to lay down spikes in front of the tow truck and prevent the pursuit all together?
[3:52:30] playswitsquirrel: cops still forming as a team, not there yet but gettin better
[3:52:33] Ancor_: are you on the right channel?
[3:52:34] rocker22_: they must not be there
[3:52:35] pepedoot: air1 all you need

His Kyrptonian biological makeup is enhanced by earth’s yellow sun. If Lois gets a tan, the kid could kick right through her stomach.

[9:37:32] rapha2718: you can solve these puzzles step by step by always finding the spot where there is no other possibility than one specific color and move slowly forward like this. Like with this puzzle you should first fill in the blaacks around the "1"s, because they are 100% fixed.

[9:38:08] lawlkat: "a black"? insensitive
[9:38:09] TheKingOfWit: the corners of the 1s don't have to be black
[9:38:10] tacticallupus: can there be any black around the 9 tho?
[9:38:12] BrettRPG: The corners can be white on the 1

[9:38:43] krenblaylock: the answer is 8.1
[9:38:43] EvilCoatrack: Looks like diagonals don't need to be black to isolate white regions
[9:38:44] TheGodmother: Pause 󠀀
[9:38:44] Rixxey: I just looked at this and my brain started hurting
[9:38:46] Wadapon: I feel like it doesn't have to go all the way around the 1s, like the corners could be part of the other tiles
[9:38:52] IAmAlphaKing69: 9 you move to the bottom left and take up that whole space
[9:38:56] bobdang07hd: question is can 9 interact with the 2 to make 11 and finish the corner, just a thought no idea how it works
