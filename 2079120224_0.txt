[0:31:17] Wolv022: Friend Jeremy being the one content creator you know who can drive alongside yourself is weirdly fitting
[0:31:20] MaskedCritic: @kyr_useddentaldam For performance, Legends Arceus. For sheer volume of content, Scarlet and Violet. For most epic battles, Sword and Shield. For classic playstyle, Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl. And if you're a weirdo who just loves the style of Pokemon Go over classic Pokemon, I guess you can play Let's Go Pikachu or Let's Go Eevee...
[0:31:23] MassacreMan101: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
[0:31:24] Entorien_Scriber: Jeremy has an amazing car, assuming he still has the Mustang.
[0:31:27] DrewBlanko: AAAA CRIME

[0:31:42] Nightbot: TaskMattser's on...sit yourself down...TaskMattser's on...in your hometown!
[0:32:04] OceanLightly: Yes, which probably would give you info on when those folks are home
[0:32:12] Entorien_Scriber: I assume that's so you can scout when people are at home.
[0:32:15] RockyJGames: @kuroiryuuga You have to trade in your driver’s lisence to get your streamer’s lisence

[0:34:03] Entorien_Scriber: I have tried picking locks. I can do a basic padlock if I have a proper set of tools like the ones we just saw. It's kind of noisy the way I do it though. Quietly is much harder.
[0:34:03] Frootscat: LMAO
[0:34:08] Drocane: I do

[0:34:30] dani_007a_: Routers are random spawns in most houses. You won't know until you break in to every house.

[0:35:22] leenyan479: Matt is shopping for a new wireless router for his home
[0:35:30] Frootscat: arguably without context that might make it worse to the FBI agent watching your search engine
[0:35:36] BunnyKnuckle: axialHillenborn wheres my router bobby
[0:35:49] dani_007a_: @AxialMatt IIRC, it's mostly random spawns.
[0:35:50] MassacreMan101: @Frootscat We can easily cross reference it to Matt playing this
[0:35:50] kuroiryuuga: Yeah, I kinda doubt anyone has mapped out this particular valuable
[0:35:54] ZephyrSiren: Are routers randomly generated?

[0:38:42] kuroiryuuga: they just use their phone's hotspots
[0:38:47] MassacreMan101: @AxialMatt There could be multiple routers in the house, maybe steal just 1 per house?
[0:38:53] Mustank72: thanks mod
[0:38:55] MrAldibe: community wifi probably
[0:38:58] Frootscat: no these people are rejecting modernity and unplugging
[0:38:59] MaskedCritic: they probably all do, they can be in drawers and closets and shit
[0:39:01] flowbermeows: what are the odds that there are 0 routers
[0:39:05] Frootscat: respect their lifestyle
[0:39:09] dani_007a_: How far is Matt in this file? There are some houses he might need better tools to get into.
[0:39:10] StickPonyLad: @Mustank72 I allowed it, Nightbot said no anyways
[0:39:11] Entorien_Scriber: They're stealing WiFi from the neighbours
[0:39:22] MassacreMan101: Ah

[0:39:57] kuroiryuuga: No, I think you should have to get every router on a single run
[0:39:58] dani_007a_: If you leave and come back, they might have a router, lol.

[0:45:03] OceanLightly: @StickPonyLad little blue booties
[0:45:23] DittoAsher: I never had to call them so idk how long the response time would’ve been.
[0:45:27] Mustank72: Welcome to the Stream @DittoAsher
[0:45:37] gbdspaeth: Matt's over here bragging about having friends
[0:45:53] DittoAsher: thank you @mustank72
[0:45:53] DrewBlanko: LETS ROB

[0:46:04] Mustank72: LETS STEAL!
[0:46:05] BawkMartins: Cheer500 I've got a great idea. This security system is probably set up to automatically alert the authorities. If you were to steal their router, it won't be able to call the cops
[0:46:05] TeagenTheChickenLady: @gbdspaeth 🤣
[0:46:06] Drocane: It might!
[0:46:12] manamoto: Morning/afternoon/evening all!

[0:47:01] flying_aa: the other officers made fun of bush cop, but he had the last laugh
[0:47:02] StickPonyLad: Bush cop? I may have misunderestimated him
[0:47:03] adamcw: Surprise Bush tazer
[0:47:15] DittoAsher: never mind libraries or schools, our bushes need cops
[0:47:20] StickPonyLad: @AxialMatt we refunded it like 5 minutes ago
[0:47:23] HeavyMetalGamer7887: Do I remember AH videos where the car was used to jump fences?
[0:47:30] kuroiryuuga: Some houses have roaming guards
[0:47:38] Meridian75W: Yeeeah mistake. I was looking at the redeems and forgot I clicked on one to read it, forgot to x it out
[0:47:38] Malakengago: I pictured something completely different when I think of the phrase "surprise bush taser"
[0:47:40] Nightbot: Want to chat with your fellow Mages? How about participate in community events like Mario Kart or Jackbox? Come join the discord! https://discord.gg/RBUeWRG
[0:47:40] Doth_Sypris: Matt u had a question about your GTA task is it on single player or multi-player
[0:47:49] StickPonyLad: @kuroiryuuga I prefer Egyptian guards
[0:48:16] robotoast03: any big worth items obtained yet?

[0:48:36] dani_007a_: Loot is mostly random in Thief Sim, so there's no way to know which houses will have routers unless you break in.
[0:48:36] manamoto: He's in! How does he get out again?
[0:48:39] Frootscat: tbf it was rather bold to break into the front door anyway
[0:48:46] osakey: Honey, why is there a car parked by our back fence?
[0:48:51] Nightbot: Sometimes things get busy and Matt may miss cheers or messages but they’re still appreciated!
[0:48:56] StickPonyLad: punch the window
[0:49:01] Roxoah: they definitely don't want to lose their router
[0:49:04] MaskedCritic: this task... might not be possible, he doesn't seem leveled up enough
[0:49:05] Roxoah: honestly, neither would I
[0:49:06] skullandcrossstitch: That's weird of them
[0:49:09] StickPonyLad: Santa Claus your way in
[0:49:11] Drocane: This isn't a fresh save is it

[0:49:39] BradCasalinuovo: STEAL THE CAR
[0:49:49] dani_007a_: @InspectorDens Only certain items. Things are different each time.
[0:50:06] Meridian75W: limesNoted

[0:51:00] AschTB: das funny
[0:51:13] kuroiryuuga: probably on site security
[0:51:13] Frootscat: imagine how messed up it would be if you called the police for a break in and the person was able to get away by hiding in your house
[0:51:16] flying_aa: they didnt have bush cop this time
[0:51:19] BradCasalinuovo: Dumbass cops
[0:51:41] MaskedCritic: @dani_007a_ I don't think Matt knows how to read, we've both told him they can be hidden at least 3 times each, but he has seen none of it
[0:51:42] Hotarg: Response comes fast, cheap, or thorough.  They chose fast and cheap
[0:51:47] DahniMae: @Frootscat sorry man we didn't find him in your house, he probbaly left idk

[0:53:55] Erika_Racewind: No router? Must be living off grid.
[0:53:56] Superguppy2006: I thought this game put router in drawers somewhat often
[0:53:59] MassacreMan101: I'm back! Steal any routers yet?
[0:54:05] kuroiryuuga: Matt, these families are "cultured".  Something as plebian as 'the internet' is much too far beneath them
[0:54:06] InspectorDens: @MassacreMan101 nope
[0:54:07] skullandcrossstitch: What, are you just gonna keep your router out where people can see it? your shame?
[0:54:10] gbdspaeth: but that's internet security

[0:54:38] dani_007a_: They are frequently in drawers, lol.
[0:54:40] sunnydito: i do recall them being in closets and drawers
[0:54:40] MassacreMan101: You have to start looking in the really odd spots
[0:54:42] InspectorDens: They're rich enough to just beam it into their house
[0:54:52] MassacreMan101: Behind the painting?
[0:54:53] leafiest_greens: check the bathroom
[0:54:53] MaskedCritic: I think routers can even be in safes, can't they?
[0:54:57] Tracet1: maybe the cops arrested them
[0:55:02] SiriusTex: try asking the owners where it is
[0:55:08] FubArchaeologist: will you take... pants
[0:55:13] sweetmeat7: Rich people usually put their routers as far away as possible from the devices they service.  That's why they complain about their internet being shitty
[0:55:19] DittoAsher: full shelves just for two hats
[0:55:20] skullandcrossstitch: Why are there jeans in my router drawer
[0:55:24] Entorien_Scriber: One pair of jeans per drawer? These people are weird.
[0:55:30] MassacreMan101: Matt would be better off impersonating a technician
[0:55:31] sokabrew: BOO! 👻

[0:56:08] Roxoah: how many pairs of shoes does this hosuehold have?
[0:56:11] Reiderreiter: @techwiz2100 Some of the people in this neighborhood are weird
[0:56:15] MaskedCritic: @techwiz2100 nope. This game places things randomly in pretty weird ways at times, it's hilarious
[0:56:18] FubArchaeologist: router in a drawer is supreme cable management
[0:56:19] skullandcrossstitch: One pair of shoes per drawer is unhinged
[0:56:19] ZephyrSiren: A pair of what
[0:56:21] kuroiryuuga: why are there pants in a drawer in a hallway?
[0:56:23] dani_007a_: But they are BlackBay items, so they do have set locations. Just like the eggs.

[0:56:42] DittoAsher: bathroom router?
[0:56:45] BawkMartins: @sweetmeat7 and then they buy two different brands of outlet-plug 2.4GHz-only wifi extenders and put them as far away from each other as physically possible
[0:56:48] Entorien_Scriber: What was the little white thing in a hall drawer?
[0:56:48] AmayaTheKing: IDK about anyone else, but there are no empty drawers in my house. They are always full of crap I forgot about
[0:56:54] leafiest_greens: they web surf in the tub
[0:56:58] techwiz2100: sneakerheads in shambles watching this gameplay
[0:57:06] anashtonofsass: Empty drawers? In this economy?
[0:57:10] EarthboundJedi: you don't find wifi, wifi finds you
[0:57:13] abbasgail_: I saw two episodes of House Hunters, and between the two couples, they had a total of 250 pairs of shoes
[0:57:20] Meridian75W: There are 14 total houses with Wifi in this town
[0:57:22] sweetmeat7: @BawkMartins exactly, because as long as it gets the slightest bit of signal, it will amplify to its max potential.  SCIENCE!!!!
[0:57:22] dani_007a_: @AmayaTheKing Everyone has a junk drawer! I just have 20 of them...
[0:57:29] Erika_Racewind: Does anyone know if a house in game can have more than one router? Just curious.
[0:57:34] DrSuperKamiGuru: Of course they left. The house has no internet.
[0:57:41] MassacreMan101: These people are going to be very confused when they find all their drawers open
[0:57:48] SiriusTex: call the cops and tell them a serious crime has been committed. a house with no wifi
[0:57:50] leafiest_greens: take the ashes
[0:58:01] Roxoah: they all have snapbacks too, LMAO
[0:58:03] techwiz2100: take the console, leave controllers
[0:58:05] BawkMartins: @MassacreMan101 Oh man, Mark must've been trying to find the router so he can reboot it
[0:58:05] InspectorDens: @Erika_Racewind yes and many do
[0:58:06] techwiz2100: assert dominance
[0:58:10] Chetters: Wireless means that you don't have to plug it in right, it could be ANYWHERE.
[0:58:12] SiriusTex: is it in the safe?

[1:00:28] mrcrazycatlad: I think they can be in the bathroom, as ridiculous as that is

[1:01:14] risi_reeses: They anticipated you stealing the router so they hid it in the safe
[1:01:15] BawkMartins: Cheer500 FYI this is what it's like working as an internet technician when people complain about their wifi strength. "where is it?" "no way they'd put it in a safe" "Is it in this cabinet"
[1:01:20] MassacreMan101: I mean you put a router IN a house
[1:01:21] MasterAllan83: Does the safe act like a Ferriday Cage?
[1:01:27] BigLittleHelper: Have you considered that there just LAN party people?
[1:01:29] dani_007a_: @Superguppy2006 Only the 100 numbers are valid for this. The 200 and 300 are on different streets.
[1:01:37] Erika_Racewind: What if you put the router in another router so you can router while you router

[1:03:25] mrcrazycatlad: Have you checked their car? Clearly they like to take it on drives
[1:03:26] ArcAngel4774: Not fren jeremy
[1:03:28] dani_007a_: @AlecH233 You only need the first 5, the others are on different streets.
[1:03:29] DittoAsher: they have it all tethered to their phone data
