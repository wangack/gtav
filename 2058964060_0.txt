[0:39:15] imSteffin: flashlight should be serialized figure out where its from if its ems I wouldn't raid Hmm
[0:39:15] Berserake: They need to distinguish the charge from PD vs Governement equipment charges
[0:39:16] Kiester_Felterbutts: Tsunami incomming
[0:39:17] RonJon: You can just take it, doesn't mean you HAVE to raid his house
[0:39:17] PacGamer: PD and civ flashlight yee
[0:39:19] TrickModeX: God Twitch is funny. I watch your stream all the time but this time Twitch listed you on my front page as "While Squeex is offline" loll
[0:39:20] hollowrust: they can pick up evidence markers and pullets and shit
[0:39:21] TheRoseForce: Is it the old Evidence pick up flashlights?
[0:39:22] noah_a_104: add the hat
[0:39:24] danknesss4207: @EsfandTV you see jinny just got a $10k dono
[0:39:24] n0oxaskek: where is the hat SuperMadge
[0:39:25] red_sworm: can we see the hat
[0:39:26] jinnytolls: Why are cornwoods shoes looking weird?
[0:39:26] RossTheBoss__: a flashlight and a fleshlight that can see DNA
[0:39:26] goldenjerdiss: should get with doctors and tell them not to do that as well because its gettin folks raided
[0:39:27] Zanduin: the admins need to remove flashlights from doctors if doctors have the power to ruin that
[0:39:28] rascaca_hs: don t you need a judge to sign for a raid
[0:39:29] TheKingOfWit: Missing something here, how does a flashlight ruin an investigation?
[0:39:30] itsNudeGrandpa: Would make a UV flashlight that picks up on evidence be a better idea?
[0:39:30] Wheelchairman101: You should need to be on duty for the flashlight to work
[0:39:32] ScyThE619: also he has a murder charge
[0:39:33] DamnitAngel_: maybe thats them trying to make it easier on u guys
[0:39:34] ToyLetTreat: There just needs to be a pd UV light and flashlighta
[0:39:36] batperson: ye free hat!
[0:39:37] superbear922: Maybe call the pd flashlight a uv flashlight. And regular cand s3e evidence
[0:39:37] PandaNomsBamboo: pd flashlights and ems fleshlights PepeLaugh
[0:39:38] God_is_a_cat_girl: PD Flashlight should be a Blacklight OkayChamp
[0:39:39] Mandrenn: gotta giv crims a way to cover up their crimes
[0:39:39] Icesevage: The list was made by Crane and Nekoda
[0:39:40] repivv: Wonder if crims even know what flashlights do
[0:39:41] Khaosshinobi: esp because he became giga defensive about it pepeLaugh

[0:39:44] skilleto19: YEP !00%
[0:39:47] Felaryn: America Just don't be illegal
[0:39:50] Kiester_Felterbutts: we doo we doo we doo we doo (sounding alarm)
[0:39:52] Zinzio: Raids should be for bigger things, not a flashlight imo
[0:39:53] GLSMarbles: I feel like flashlights are a really good reason since they let you hide evidence, right?
[0:39:54] red_sworm: what about the hat ?
[0:39:57] n0oxaskek: Cornwood should be dapped for not wearing a hat on duty
[0:39:58] ITZxJeff: isnt that rs not pc?
[0:39:58] SarahFlare: also the fact he's so defensive as well, like if you don't have anything to hide make it easy on everyone.
[0:39:58] owlx7: does he have a hat to go with the new drip?
[0:39:59] Krypt_256: Sound like PD dying to make a legit bust using flashlight as a big score
[0:40:00] Freddiepines: why would EMS or Doctors have a tool for collecting evidence PepoG
[0:40:03] kkulf_kkulf: slowJAM
[0:40:04] hushbang: Pd flashlight shouldbe a light saber that can cut criminals down
[0:40:06] Wheelchairman101: @God_is_a_cat_girl Actual great idea
[0:40:07] komplike: why is he running in circles??
[0:40:08] imSteffin: @Zinzio, a flashlight isn't just SIMPLY a flashlight though. It does a lot more.
[0:40:08] hollowrust: its time
[0:40:09] Jrooks: are the flashlights serialized?
[0:40:10] TKNG: Yup, in rp anyone can get a flashlight... It's just weird but it is PD equipment too so idk
[0:40:10] Leafyerick: If he doesn't own the house the key belongs to you'd need permission from the home owner and it would affect other tenants as well if it's a rental

[0:40:18] Zanduin: +1 Dap for Doctor
[0:40:19] DamnitAngel_: its hard to get hard evidence in a video game like this tho so it kinda sounds like a pd buff
[0:40:21] Diamondman121314: I agree that the PD should have a separate type of flashlight for evidence
[0:40:25] Fast_doughnut: Did you talk to that doctor yesterday about that ifax you found on a person?
[0:40:27] Redmanuscript: what happened with Red last night?

[0:41:23] Thraxton1: I think the item description should clearly state that it is government equipment, that way you won't have people taken by surprise when they get hit by a massive fine and a raid over a flashlight

In many cases backpack is not included in a frisk search as the frisk is for weapons for the officer's safety unless they are being charged with a crime in which it becomes PC to search much like a vehicle. Not sure if his simply being in the store at the time counts as PC to search him without their consent. The question is did Cornwood establish PC to search the backpack in  the eyes of the court as far as admissible evidence?

[4:54:54] Zanduin: @MillerThyme game mechanics
[4:54:54] Alidokta: @MagicTheHydrated In this situation, only one person was arrested. I think robbery sticks, but as he did the act of robbery, i feel like stacking possession on top wouldn't stick since only one suspect is proven to be part of the crime
[4:54:56] angelus86: so instead of helping those people we stay in the PD for 2 hours

[4:55:00] JakeStratic: @bunnyrabbits88 It is 100% it is "Beyond a reasonable doubt" it would be unreasonable for this person to not have stolen the goods. His admitted to it. Them arguing "but we don't know who owns the store" is powergaming because the locals/government does.
[4:55:00] Leafyerick: @EsfandTV IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT. IT'S ABOUT HAVING PROOF

[4:56:34] Shmoopee: Hes dragging it out on purpose. because the charges are so minuscule and yet they fight tooth and nail KNOWING they're lying. so if he has to gather every little bit of info. they need to wait as much as Cornwood

[4:57:06] yobson: CAUGHT wasn't me
[4:57:06] NickMastaFlex: A judge would side with cornwood
[4:57:07] Thraxton1: I really don't think it will be hard to prove at all, the store was in possession of the HVAC blowers and he took them from the store, if noone else comes out to say they own the HVAC units and left them in the store then the store is in legal possession. There, you have proved robbery. Easy as.

[4:57:23] SarahFlare: and it was all deep down in his pockets
[4:57:23] lubyou3000: Haha just let a judge hear the case then
[4:57:23] ssmackyy_: esfand you're late to teh new years party
[4:57:23] Moregorilla: Flag out for justice time
[4:57:23] Thozel: @Thozel true. but didn't he say multiple times that he stole them
[4:57:24] GLSMarbles: but is it PSA 10?
[4:57:24] Loco_Cubano: @EsfandTV you saw 3 people, 2 went up, you heard them going up. You caught the guy with the goods and the tool needed to steal them. ITS JOEVER
[4:57:24] Sarcon: take it to bench fuck it lol
[4:57:24] PSturtle: It's also crazy that admin doesn't provide the real prices for the HVAC blowers? These admin really made this hardcore mode for the PD LUL
[4:57:25] Sanivay: Then charge him and move on
[4:57:25] calcifero7: just send it on all them
[4:57:26] Zanduin: A judge would find him guilty, you dont need proof, you need a Judge to believe you
[4:57:26] i_n_s_o_m_n_i_o_u_s: Any judge in their right mind would agree with Cornwood
[4:57:27] killartist32: Only under assumption. Hear/Say
[4:57:27] heinousanus95: Charge him. If they dont like it, take it to court. Period
[4:57:28] Kat_Katinsky: oh, condition dropped?
[4:57:28] shamison1: Cornwood LITERALLY pulled up, the alarm is going off, the guy has the stolen goods on him, like it cant be anymore straight forward????
[4:57:28] RobialT: Either it works or the entire justice system is broken
[4:57:28] skilleto19: Charge him with Tampering if he denies stealing it LUL

[4:57:33] fishmeatx: no hate but server stuff isn't as planned out as it should be
[4:57:34] DaltonCL: DNA THIS
[4:57:34] honk_ponk_: Diving into a clothing store and swapping clothes in two seconds is not good rp.
[4:57:35] jburke23: At this point they might as well get rid of the prison because nobody goes there at this point
[4:57:36] SavageTarzan: PepeLaugh TeaTime
[4:57:37] tsugaru001: Did you see him take it?
[4:57:37] infininci: he coulda just picked up the screwdriver in the store that someone dropped in there
[4:57:38] Talker100: trial
[4:57:38] maggielynn22: plus you know he lied when he said he was in the store for 10 min before cause you looked
[4:57:38] EPiQ: that's why you just book them on that and leave it for court
[4:57:39] komplike: @EsfandTV they are playing lawyer.. they try to lower the charge at all cost.. even sweet talking you.. its just rp, say no and charge him or say yes and get him less.. ICANT
[4:57:39] Gachiguru: youve got his friendliness with yuno and charlotte may and both of them were on scene
[4:57:40] LoudPackNoReefa: you have photos on roof?
[4:57:41] BoogieAnimal: would a bench trial be faster for a judge to say they are guilty?
[4:57:41] D4NK_M3Ds: book em for 2 hours
[4:57:42] Farmerr_: Tells you it's not theft/grand theft bc not stealing from a person... so you change to robbery but now he's not stealing from store either!? LUL
[4:57:43] Talker100: let judge decide
[4:57:43] ItsEdBoi_: @EsfandTV Its how they made the system so u need to prove it through the justice system first but yea its pretty obvious
[4:57:43] catadv: different clothes and you found just 1 person
[4:57:43] PicklemanJaro: dude id say just push robbery at this point LULW
[4:57:44] Ancor_: then let the judge decide idk
[4:57:44] Totikki: You dont even need DNA as he said he stole/took it
[4:57:46] condor2104: in court you would lose that argument unfortunately
[4:57:47] bunnyrabbits88: theres bound to be dna if they picked it up though
[4:57:48] skilleto19: @honk_ponk_ YEP PowerGaming
[4:57:48] OddSwizzle: how in the absolute fuck are we still here? i've been gone for like 2 hours

[4:57:52] LHaxorP: prbly onyl going to eb partial after 1:20 but o well
[4:57:52] kleytonbruck_br: Sometimes crims want you to give proof that even the game doesn't give like Ramee, this one not so much but its really bad how it works
[4:57:52] SimpOnMyShrimp: LUL
[4:57:53] Mac_Parts: @EsfandTV Dose having the other two charges sticking matter
[4:57:53] danski42: DNA and fingerprint it so when he claims someone else left it it will support your claim
[4:57:53] Stinfeket: -1
[4:57:55] yobson: if it's mint condition then clearly it wasnt ever in use and was likely never installed and left abandoned on the roof therefore he can't have stole it EZ
[4:57:55] ArtificialHelix: @tsugaru001 Did you see me steal your phone, dumb logic
[4:57:55] sckrew: Listening

[4:58:06] xnicolerose21: cops IRL dont even give people this much leeway LUL
[4:58:06] rodolfo872: It's just sad that they can go into full bs history mode, and you can prove it because of the mechanics
[4:58:06] Moregorilla: Flag out for you to give final judgement hahah
[4:58:07] owlx7: Sub only.  RP + 1
[4:58:08] hotairforacoolbreeze: 2 hr interro for HVAC?

[4:58:15] moonstonexy: just need to place him on the roof with DNA and all charges stick
[4:58:16] ChitChilli: the burden of evidence should be easier. there aren‚Äôt thousands of people online, and the crims shouldn‚Äôt be under rules that are meant to distinguish millions. some balance is needed for sure
[4:58:19] Karter6t: Hit him with Robbery and Pocession. Set the standard for that crime
[4:58:19] NotSeanLoucks: true
[4:58:21] TheKingOfWit: cornwoods RP is good, he's getting pissed crims are getting off on BS and he's doing his best, it makes total sense, feels real
[4:58:21] Zanduin: @tsugaru001 Possessing stolen good at the location of reported theft/tresspassing at the time of alarm
[4:58:22] TICKsoundsLIKe: true
[4:58:22] Smoogol: IFISPEAK it's obvious that he did it but you still have to prove it
[4:58:22] stressed_tess: it does make sense that they need to release pd equivalent to new crim stuff
[4:58:23] ArtificialHelix: THis is fake RP, its already case close if it was real RP
[4:58:24] TheGhostlyOnyx: @shamison1 he has a right to a trial though
[4:58:24] M80_Osm: work with what you got

[4:58:24] CrutonArt: peepoTalk
[4:58:24] Pravolution: There should be a rate limit of changing clothes
[4:58:26] my69thaccount: dumbass people think this is real life
[4:58:27] Athasin: @Athasin @xseaka And he was asked by the Capt afterwards to show where the missing serial numbers were. And almost got in trouble for perjury.
[4:58:27] TheLastRace: Breaking cuffs 5 times in a row is a great example
[4:58:28] nuudelz: every single person running from a cop is not good rp either
[4:58:28] HavingFunWrong: true
[4:58:29] fishmeatx: no hate but server gameplay  stuff isn't as planned out as it should be
[4:58:29] guilt_: I like boobs
[4:58:30] Coop914: THIS IS NOT REALISTIC
[4:58:32] BelllGoR: and the devs dont want cops to know the new crim game mechanics unless someone snitches
[4:58:33] KNGRSM: But no hard evidence
[4:58:34] kidiane: shxtouGun shxtouGun
[4:58:36] andtheraincamedown: should take a little longer yea
[4:58:36] temrob: mhm what if you could put stars on a specific player
[4:58:37] Jaeslow: just because there isnt an official 'dna' mechanic yet doesnt mean it should be discounted
[4:58:37] catadv: yeah but he was in the store for like 2 min
[4:58:38] knowlightnofear: @TheLastRace THIS
[4:58:38] 0_sh: DNA THIS
[4:58:38] samynilla: If new should only be your DNA and his

[4:58:40] offi_albertowong_cial: sup bro?
[4:58:42] Thraxton1: @EsfandTV You are right. I really don't think it will be hard to prove at all, the store was in possession of the HVAC blowers and he took them from the store, if noone else comes out to say they own the HVAC units and left them in the store then the store is in legal possession. There, you have proved robbery. Easy as.
[4:58:43] Zanduin: Change my opinion: You dont need to prove anything, you just need to convince a judge
[4:58:43] redrum359: i eat asss
[4:58:44] jolteoon: The screwdriver dna will tell a lot
[4:58:44] thebigstin: if this is rock solid like you said, why do you need a mechanic?
[4:58:44] cam_nrp: It's fail RP if they use mechanics like that that are not realistic tbh
[4:58:44] RobialT: Bad RP is asking for you to prove a non existent entity owns the HAVC system
[4:58:45] suungjinwoo: we do but try telling that same reasoning at court to jurors xD
[4:58:45] dr_tortoise: dr_tortoise subscribed at Tier 1. 
[4:58:45] RetPaladinBot: @EsfandTV - dr_tortoise just subscribed at Tier 1 PogU
[4:58:46] BigWeaponX: he even added a reason for the clothing change so I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs good on him
[4:58:48] RoadwarriorTV: Hoesntly 4.0 isnt as fun to watch as 3.0
[4:58:49] funkie: he also didnt change it in 2sec he was there for 10-20min his statement :D
[4:58:49] Mijnboot: EZ Clap
[4:58:50] RoryBear: dna drill
[4:58:51] Fabushki: just take the L
[4:58:51] thorstentomhuen: clever rl crims would have clothes to swap with em or stored around there
[4:58:52] yippyip: tools!
[4:58:53] deftcg: The proof beyond a reasonable doubt is that the units were missing from the top of the building, really not that deep
[4:58:53] MarexDS: why are you trying to prove to his LAWYER that's he's guilty, he'll always say he's not guilty and try to make you lower the charges @EsfandTV
[4:58:53] emery_steele: check drill
[4:58:53] Shmoopee: Realism vs Roleplay Susge
[4:58:53] ArtificialHelix: DNA all of it
[4:58:54] BigTreav: I love you by the way. and I love your RP, this just feels dragged out but I suppose I do get your point. Seems like cops dont have any authority to do anything lately.
[4:58:54] devisrain: Not no other dna just no dna
[4:58:55] heinousanus95: Charge him and tell the lawyer to take it to court.
[4:58:55] Edward_Theodore: so it wasn't on the floor
[4:58:55] SavageTarzan: PepeLaugh TeaTime
[4:58:55] HavingFunWrong: day doesnt last 24 hrs either so in theory they could be changing clothes for a while
[4:58:55] Mijnboot: EZ Clap GOTTEM
[4:58:57] justacyrus2: dont check the drill
[4:58:57] jimmybegood: Thats not the issue. The issue is you have the photos, the evidence shows its him... take him to court THAT will fix the bad RP
[4:58:57] BanditFierce: @EsfandTV no more sherriff uniform? :(
[4:58:58] ImortalWarriorTV: they're trying to fight over soemthing so dumb they should bve charged even more

[4:59:02] Johnjoy121: Yeah so push it to court and fight for the other charges, he already confessed
[4:59:03] taraannee: it‚Äôs funny bc chat used to be mad u can‚Äôt use common sense to convict & you‚Äôd explain why not, now it‚Äôs reversed LUL LUL
[4:59:04] Edward_Theodore: EZ
[4:59:05] Utschig: EZ dna
[4:59:05] Serakkis: You have a confession, just go for Robbery catBreakdance Dead to Rights
[4:59:06] Stinfeket: Screwdriver?

[4:59:08] Khaosshinobi: @EsfandTV did you pass your proposal to the PD liaison yet?
[4:59:08] ChitChilli: good
[4:59:08] thebigstin: you are jus wasting time tho, bench and go
[4:59:09] jimmybegood: Thats not the issue. The issue is you have the photos, the evidence shows its him... take him to court THAT will fix the bad RP,,
[4:59:09] sedmidivka: @chitchilli no it shouldn't be easier. it's not real life they can be send to jail but they don't need to spend hours in there. it's enough to have hefty charges.
[4:59:09] Chrisaroo_: Test the screwdriver

[4:59:18] PrushkaB: I'm with you on the charges, but I really think you just need to charge him and send it through. They can't stop you, this arguing is best for a court.
[4:59:18] JFloUnknown: WRANGLE THEM NODDERS
[4:59:18] Atrix646: GIGACHAD SEND EM TO JAIL
[4:59:19] Zanduin: You dont need to convince his lawyer, just ask if he wants a trial or charges
[4:59:19] PSturtle: You forgot to check the drill tho
[4:59:19] Jaeslow: just because there isnt an official 'dna' mechanic yet (i think) it doesnt mean it should be discounted and crims shouldnt worry
[4:59:19] heavyd834: you really should put chat in emote or sub only mode when you get into serious rp or interrogation type rp, too many stupid and cringe chatters

[4:59:35] owlx7: just stunlock this guy GIGACHAD
[4:59:36] shamison1: The problem is 4.0 the cops cant do anything, they catch crims literally red handed like legit at the scene of the crime with the stolen shit in their pockets, and they cant even lay a charge? Its fucked.

[4:59:42] laaazylemon: you have a picture of him on the bottom of a ladder, there is no physical proof that he was ever on the roof is what a judge would say...
[4:59:42] DrWetbone: crims should stop and drop when a cop pulls a weapon on them not run around like loose animals
[4:59:42] Fascinated_viewer: Paper work too IRL
[4:59:42] not_uniq: yeah sitting at PD for 4-5 hours typing shit is just stupid. could be out for those 4-5 hours patrolling

[4:59:47] KNGRSM: But why you cant prove the charges
[4:59:49] SarahFlare: Honestly, hardwood needed to happen.
[4:59:49] Loco_Cubano: @EsfandTV there is such a thing as abuse of game mechanics. But I don't think fast cloth swaps count as such. It's more.. not in the spirit of rp. It's in the spirit of winning the situation.
[4:59:49] BoldSlowbro: it‚Äôs the devs fault
[4:59:50] oofinside: Listening
[4:59:50] superrtedy: thats what happens when you do 18hours of cop rp

[4:59:52] devisrain: You found NO DNA on it including his..
[4:59:53] angelus86: this was always the case since 3.0 you just didn't do it
[4:59:53] Xanisselis: Hel yeah I love this cornwood Arc truthfully
[4:59:53] Zanduin: Shoto will never do crime again!
[4:59:53] spartacus1j: @EsfandTV You saying paperwork is way to much is the exact reason you are going to lose this case. No hard evidence and way to many reaches

[4:59:56] Allegiance86: the burden is insanely high considering that people want to rp crims but cant accept that occasionally that means running afoul of the pd
[4:59:56] GLSMarbles: you gotta let em know
[4:59:58] Koilos_: yeah, I just go on youtube during paperwork

[5:00:20] thebigstin: just take the 1 charge or take it to bench. whatever else is happening is a waste of time
[5:00:21] ArtificialHelix: @CARPExxDiem The not locals
[5:00:21] i_n_s_o_m_n_i_o_u_s: hard agree. its so lame seeing crims get off easy just cuz no one has the patience to properly see each case through.
[5:00:23] yippyip: if people misuse the whole proof thing, then they will feel the pain of everything needed to be proven
[5:00:23] NickMastaFlex: Such an easy case
[5:00:24] sabadios: I like the clowns the best since they'll give good chases, snit on everyone, twist things and lie, etc., but in the end they admit to doing it all.
[5:00:24] babyeater79: dont be sorry. they want to do crim shit then they gotta do crim time
[5:00:24] BoogieAnimal: if they want to argue small charges and take 3 hours then thats on them LUL
[5:00:24] RexPappa: Im with you, these crims do crime and go put themselves in these situations but when theyre caugh theyre like "owffiwer I didnt do anywing TwT". Come on

[5:00:29] sevenevilmuffins: The bad RP is coming from the lawyer guy arguing still
[5:00:30] TheGhostlyOnyx: @spartacus1j 4Shrug maybe it fell into his pocket you don't know
[5:00:30] BigTreav: He knows he cant prove the charges chat, I think the point is, that hes making it more annoying and hard for crims to just say it wasnt me, go to court and then get charges dropped. police seem to have no power in the city. so this is cornwoods way of punishing them into pleading guilty KEKW
[5:00:30] hngryghozt: COP POWER TRIP
[5:00:32] Serakkis: Chatters saying did you see him do it? You think convictions only happen with eye witnesses? lol
[5:00:32] K3ffK3vv: why didn‚Äôt you DNA check the screwdriver?
[5:00:32] knowlightnofear: Blaming the "cop" for being stubborn here.....and not the "crim" shows the low intelligence of those suggesting it
[5:00:32] Recon_XoX: dentt
[5:00:32] BoldSlowbro: no pixel devs add a half broken system into the server

[5:00:35] skilleto19: They are wasting your time especially when they know they  you Caught them red handed LUL
[5:00:36] xseaka: BURDEN OF PROOF cant be higher than the game mechanics allow you to prove, it doesnt make any fuckin sense
[5:00:37] MillerThyme: LULW
[5:00:37] beerhuffer: moon2DOIT
[5:00:37] rickyred66: I think it's the changing of the rules that people are complaining about. Y'all shouldn't flip flop on what you are or aren't supposed to do
[5:00:38] TakeAChance: @EsfandTV Why don't you just charge him then? Let them fight in court if they want to
[5:00:39] Athasin: @jaybopp82 Cops lied too much in 3.0 which is why it doesn't. And it's why Slacks fired Johnson
[5:00:39] Astavexa: Crims question everything, its boring to watch
[5:00:39] noah_a_104: when are yall going to take the peanut kidnapping case to the docket  @EsfandTV
[5:00:40] comrade_raptor: a lot of crims are less interested in RPing and more interested in playong efficiently lmao its so weird @esfandtv
[5:00:42] VioVeoh: there also needs to be a value to the lawyers rp also though, take a little give a little not for the crim, but for ziggy
[5:00:43] Zanduin: @hngryghozt get em out of here
[5:00:43] 0_sh: Tasty
[5:00:44] thecrazyjoker458: 5Head Newtons law
[5:00:44] LegitBanana_: @EsfandTV can you dna test the drill?
[5:00:44] ZachFromChat: "Be a real serious cop no SBS" Okay GIGACHAD this is literally what they want
[5:00:45] rnAlsation: Anyone arguing against this hasn't watched Mr. K and Ramee scream for 2 hours that they didn't do it and everything was planted on them.
[5:00:47] AykoKnockz: do you think crims just plead guilty in irl to every charge?
[5:00:47] Mojorsin: i still remembre the bs case - I dont remembre-.
[5:00:47] MillerThyme: RP it out
[5:00:47] PowerTurbo: if I were a criminal I would get every cop stuck in interrogations LUL

[5:00:48] judgement_12: this is ramee‚Äôs fault imo
[5:00:49] catadv: the bad think is the cops dont know how to evaluate this cause is not a book or something...like they should have something when a new think is put in
[5:00:50] sedmidivka: so you will punish the crims who RP and talk to you because you don't like how it is to be a cop?? how would they change this for you?? from now on I would as crim call the lawyer every time and go to the bench trial every arrest. until YOU get it
[5:00:52] killerpvm: they got caught just admit it and move on
[5:00:53] thecrazyjoker458: HUH

[5:00:59] hngryghozt: @zanduin get em out of here
[5:01:00] xnicolerose21: its not fair that cops have to put in literally 6 hrs paperwork time and the crims get deals constantly
[5:01:01] kointoss88: it;s also the crims need to honor their RP, and learn when to take their Ls
[5:01:02] shamison1: Am i stupid or? people out here saying you dont have solid evidence, the man literally had the stolen goods on him?!
[5:01:02] xjustaman: omg please just eat before u talk xD  shit drives me crazy

[5:01:08] typicaluser777: @judgement_12 YES bc he bullies and wants to get his way, then throws a fit when it doesnt
[5:01:08] guilt_: She wanted me to tell you she saw you dance. She said, when you were little, you and her had a fight, right before your dance recital. You thought she didn‚Äôt come see you dance. She did. She hid in the back so you wouldn‚Äôt see. She said you were like an angel. She said you came to the place where they buried her. Asked her a question? She said the answer is... ‚ÄúEvery day.‚Äù What did you ask?
[5:01:08] PsychoJoker: @Astavexa then dont watch it? LUL its kinda simple

[5:01:11] Connorbrow: @shamison1 They're agreeing to the possession charge, it's not about "can't" charge. It's that they won't accept all of the related charges
[5:01:11] 0_sh: and then HELL WEEK part 2 happens
[5:01:11] Zanduin: @sedmidivka they already do that
[5:01:12] Edward_Theodore: it has to be 50/50

[5:01:17] flantastictimes: because ;AWYERS
[5:01:19] Dumboodaking: @WasamIAm yeah but if everything boils down to "you can't mechanically prove this charge" then no charge will ever stick because there is no game mechanic to prove anything.
[5:01:19] SurelyBaked: it gets worse until there's another war and then another reset
[5:01:21] xseaka: BURDEN OF PROOF cant be higher than the game mechanics allow you to prove, it doesnt make any fuckin sense.
[5:01:21] flantastictimes: SSEE
[5:01:22] Thraxton1: @TheGhostlyOnyx Then you would literally never be able to prove any theft whatsoever from any business that is owned by a local, because the locals cant go to the court and confirm it's theirs, If you RP it out then obviously the Building owner would tell the police their HVAC units are missing, it's just bullshit from the crims trying to make the lack of mechanics work in their favour
[5:01:23] superrtedy: probs do too many hours as cop rp instead of having a 2nd char
[5:01:24] owlx7: GIGACHAD cornwood
[5:01:25] brukk__: this is basicly what happens when crims cry even when they caught red handed back on 3.0 i think. they cried too much and now we have extensive paperwork+law mechanics

[5:01:27] diguinnn: YEP
[5:01:28] thebigstin: you did tho lol

[5:01:28] laaazylemon: a judge would say you have no picture of him beeing on the roof. thats all im saying

[5:01:30] jewzt: BabyRage
[5:01:30] Switchblade142: @sedmidivka He's talking about how crims argue against every 5 minute charge. They made their bed now they get to lie in it.
[5:01:31] spartacus1j: @shamison1 He did has stolen property, guilty 100%. No evidence of him trespassing, or vandalism at all

[5:01:33] i_n_s_o_m_n_i_o_u_s: @taraannee the issue is he does this ALL day long. even if he move son from this case, there will be another, then another, then another. something needs to change.
[5:01:34] Defonicx: then don‚Äôt be a cop lol

[5:01:53] TheKingOfWit: crims have been doing this for a while. ramee just yells until the charges go away
[5:01:54] jdotno: Because they believe they can win in court is the reason they are arguing for so long. This could have been over a long time ago if you didn't want to push specific charges.
[5:01:55] JoeSizzle7: You said "we can wrap this up" 20 minutes ago

[5:03:32] Helemok: i know crims will push bench trials more and more for stuff like this
[5:03:36] GigitySponges: Powergaming is the the act of using an in-game mechanic, any external information, or a roleplay concept to favor their own character or story, and give them an unfair or unrealistic advantage.
[5:03:37] Connorbrow: It is pretty close to powergaming though. They're taking advantage of a game mechanic, that being the local stores not having someone to represent them in RP
[5:03:37] Emeralblade: if there was a deal. Lawyer feels good if he gets a charge dropped, Crim feels good cause a charge was dropped, you feel good cause he still goes for the biggest charge. Could have been done an hour ago...

[5:03:47] Photocomfort: why not get a lawyer to do the work for you
[5:03:49] SeaOfEmpty: It's high commands fault. They need to set out clear instructions on what you need to charge a crime, including evidence, verified by the judges that if they have that, then they will convict.
[5:03:52] quaylewastaken: i think grand theft is a tag charge to robby

[5:04:49] jolteoon: This is such a clear and cut case I hate that it had to go for this long
[5:04:49] quaylewastaken: grand theft is for the value of the item/s and robby is the act of the crim.
[5:04:52] HulkDiesel: @slomojosh no tf it's not. 2 hours for every single case is boring AF for petty stuff like this. Criminal lawyers argue in court. Not to the cop at the PD
