[2:14:04] Avuces: Snow PauseChamp
[2:14:06] zyllatan: 4head character way of thinking is to gain favors even at a loss of money etc
[2:14:08] Julian: I love his character for that reason tho, risks are a lot different in 4.0 tho @Sylverphyre
[2:14:12] Julian: @donazeri soon <3
[2:14:14] Fapnx: How much do you value your mental well-being
[2:14:27] CopperKat: AK needs peace of mind when it comes to his investments, it makes sense. His risk taking can't be forced on everyone else's collective effort.
[2:14:31] potetoLT: just run away into the mountains
[2:14:32] Suvaacc: 4head loves to double down just cause at first but when he actually settles down and thinks about it he knows he is wrong. I think he just feels attack at first, cause he does get bitched a lot LUL
[2:14:50] epic_smee: Its 13:37 EZ
[2:14:58] mudgho: Daz Right Dez Wright
[2:15:04] gostonko: where ererior Sadding
[2:15:05] PoPelly: 4heads character does dumb shit all the time and then argues about it. thats just his thing
[2:15:05] cybplz: No it's 14:38
[2:15:30] Sylverphyre: @julian for sure, 4.0 is alot more dangerous atm, its also interesting seeing how far 4head can go with how he is, or will he be forced to change some day to adapt
[2:15:31] somebadtiming: true LUL
[2:15:40] ikrstfu: peepoBurnMoney ?
[2:15:44] vevn11: If you make sure AK and 4head got the same clear longterm vision and goals, perhaps it could work even if he does stupid shit sometimes
[2:15:47] ObamaBinDroning: YEP
[2:15:52] Mooniien: Living up to his name
[2:15:58] PoPelly: yeah 100% that makes sense

[2:16:02] the_nano_horseschlong: YEP
[2:16:03] CopperKat: the risks could erase months of work - it's just not worth it
[2:16:16] CopperKat: its unfair to them yeah
[2:16:19] srirachawoah: it was a lot easier when everyone was a millionaire
[2:16:20] DXCraze: it has to make sense for AK right
[2:16:26] DXCraze: NODDERS
[2:16:29] CopperKat: he can take his own risks but not risks for the whole group - makes sense
[2:16:31] BulletProofSwede: He is a L criminal. I remember him always selling hot guns to Pred LOL
[2:17:08] cybplz: 4head need the 10 ak crack commandments
[2:17:31] Xpatrol: Why desmond is in this contract ; he own the car  ?
[2:17:31] Suvaacc: yeah i think his character traits are more suited for servers later life when most people have achieved initial goals, in the beginning they can be little wild.
[2:17:40] martymagoo78: iC it makes sense for AK. from 4heads POV, L‚Äôs are a big part of his content and he accepts that. doesn‚Äôt work for everyone though
[2:17:42] yeslewd: @BulletProofSwede Did you know Pred was Sherrif WHAT

[2:33:07] Xpatrol: Democratic house !
[2:33:11] tarm38: well, it worked well in 3.0 because he joined a strong gang that could let him use all their cars, be millions in debt and as a gang pay his debts off etc. but its a tight economy atm
[2:33:19] juneOT: and more structure
[2:33:22] Fishnet83: adult behaviour? NOt in my RP Madge

[2:34:30] katerade38: fanfJAM fanfJAM fanfJAM fanfJAM
[2:34:35] abc1121: i think the core issue is that the group is split on mentality. one side is willing to do anything to make money while the other side wants to do more gang focused stuff

[2:36:04] tarm38: 4heads just one of those people who can fuck your character up but is so fun you still want to RP with him so you take the hit
[2:36:12] ErraticSwami: 4head loses keys
[2:36:14] juneOT: 4head is just a bum
[2:36:26] N_eel: That'll change over time no matter how much you explain that
[2:36:29] ThicccBrickBoi: His character is too dumb to differentiate that
[2:36:32] Fugeki: just join d company BatChest
[2:36:40] gurglet: too late for AK to run away from home? Is he too old for that now? Sadding
[2:36:41] somebadtiming: it might work out or not
[2:36:56] juneOT: 4head doesnt have the vision he just survives on a daily basis
[2:36:58] svan223: coming up with rules is not something that have happened yet t ho
[2:36:58] TheSoundy: If ingevar keeps threatening to leave, it definitely LOOKS childish
[2:37:02] muskin6: What i think is ak trying to dictate him which gonna affect him ooc
[2:37:06] michelmasters: You can appeal to others
[2:37:14] Xpatrol: I think everyone on the group know that , only 4head IC doesnt
[2:37:35] epic_smee: I at least understand his logic If he thought the door downstairs is locked
[2:37:50] CopperKat: AK can't have his time investment be in the fate of someone who doesn't value protecting it with some basic security mhm
[2:37:51] juneOT: same

[2:38:48] CopperKat: bringing the 2 day andy into the living room filled with 30k of chopped parts was another
[2:38:48] juneOT: progress and establishing should be priority rn
[2:38:49] snitzzzig: @Nidas Why not have 1 Key, and Share a shit car for like 11k or smth?
[2:38:53] meego0o: mayne evetyone gets an own room
[2:38:58] snitzzzig: that only those that live there can bring up
[2:39:02] snitzzzig: from parking spot
[2:39:07] skrumpee: A third floor is just a money sink for materials
[2:39:17] epic_smee: I get wanting the upper Floor to be an actual RP home to have people over.
[2:39:25] travpiper: you've already been live for 2 and a half hours?!
[2:39:29] epic_smee: But right now with the Keys its difficult
[2:39:32] gostonko: travpiper smh
[2:39:34] tarm38: the keys are savage, any time you are robbed with one on you - even if its still on you after the robbery - there's a non zero chance it's been cloned and then its like -15k
[2:39:34] JackLDN27: travpiDhead
[2:39:40] juneOT: q check
[2:40:05] Lizaard_King: do each door have its own set of keys? because can‚Äôt you just make a secret room that has its own key that everyone can leave in their apartment? so there‚Äôs a house key and a secret room key?
[2:40:06] yeslewd: but some 2 day random yea
[2:40:14] meego0o: take the 2 doctors get a trailer and live 2 lifes SeemsGood
[2:40:18] Xpatrol: @Lizaard_King no master key
[2:40:20] epic_smee: @lizaard_king nope
[2:40:20] juneOT: in the future its possible just not when things are still establishing
[2:40:22] CopperKat: is it against the rules to just have a parked car with one key in it and everyone just pulls that out to open the door?
[2:40:29] wibuge: issue is: its a new guy he doesnt know, door is being kept unlocked, meaning another gang go in and rob the place Shrug
[2:40:37] quasarptolemy: @CopperKat definitely powergamey
[2:40:43] sansxietyy: how much is a trailer
[2:41:04] juneOT: thats anti rp
[2:41:04] „Åã„Å∏„Åï„Åü„Åë„Åé„Åè: people do that?
[2:41:08] CopperKat: i guess the devs want the keys to be a risk otherwise they'd have done digital mhm
[2:41:14] yeslewd: having a backup key would be fine, but that everyone uses nah
[2:41:17] buh__b: kinda powerful lul
[2:41:21] ro666ert: when is the raffle for your house key?
[2:41:26] tarm38: i wonder how warehouses will work
[2:41:32] tarm38: because if its still a physical key its going to be wild
[2:41:34] Pheyerus: is there any kind of lock you can purchase in game currently?
[2:41:35] the_nano_horseschlong: @ro666ert KEKL
[2:41:37] Lizaard_King: yeah having your own trailer is going to be the move, you can‚Äôt risk at least your portion getting robbed
[2:41:59] Fugeki: I would love if ak bought a trap house and actually lived in it KEKW
[2:42:17] yeslewd: how much are the trails rn? like 120k?

[2:44:11] Lizaard_King: the last thing you need to is either 4head or Ming to get raided too or easily be apart of someone‚Äôs revenge arc because they screwed somebody over lol
[2:44:18] rikzoo: i missed ArgumentTime ? Sadge
[2:44:30] Mantelrorelsen: Those who are sloppy with their housekey has probably their own main sheit safe somewhere....
[2:44:48] yeslewd: 4head and ming might only get their apartments raided

[2:48:24] CopperKat: AK having his own trailer for the really important stuff will be good no matter what happens. Since houses with roommates will always be risky. A fall back nest.
[2:48:59] gostonko: where does trav live that hes up at this time?
[2:49:07] yeslewd: texas I think
[2:49:08] Lizaard_King: I think with all the new 4.0 tech, we‚Äôre gonna see a lot more detective work and investigations. It‚Äôs less about obvious crimes now and more about uncovering secret stuff, so the cops are probably going to get really curious.

[3:18:44] Bewby: Isnt everything taxed at 20 lol
[3:18:47] ItsDerfo: depends if its additive or multiplicative
[3:18:52] Tyler___24: 15% of msrp, then 15% of mrsp + tax
[3:18:53] Athasin: Honestly, I do think buying a car early is a smart play, between the rental fees and your ability to "park" it.
[3:19:16] scha_de: HmmCouncil

[3:20:13] KlybemakK: It depends how the tax is applied
[3:20:15] NemisizZ: would just be 15%
[3:20:19] TheSoundy: why not
[3:20:23] ObamaBinDroning: no they're not addable
[3:20:32] Chewp: you shouldn't be taxes on tax

[3:21:24] gostonko: yeah they're addable here KEKW
[3:21:27] anthropocide_: it depends on what the tax is applied to, base price or base price + tax1
[3:21:29] yeslewd: yea prob
[3:21:35] Zhachi1250: Its scuff for items on the ground since restart
[3:21:48] PoPelly: pretty sure you only pay one of the taxes when you buy it, you pay the other tax at city hall
[3:21:51] Yosamita: surely its 15% of the sale value not including tax right?
[3:21:56] Thubes: someone already bought a Penumbra, i can tell you much they paid if you like
[3:21:58] ItsDerfo: if its 15% of sale for sales tax and 15% of sale for registration its 30% total. If its 15% of sales for sales tax, then 15% of that new value it would equate to 15%*15%
[3:22:30] highrollergambler: you guys need a sidebar room for the meetings ooziLOPEZ
[3:22:54] Thubes: fair enough
[3:23:06] Ferrari1776: @Thubes NotLikeThis
[3:23:06] Athasin: Honestly, sales tax and registration tax should both tax the base value of the car since both taxes come from the city. Keyword being should.

[5:34:04] Jammie3d: Sadding

[5:34:37] the_nano_horseschlong: he could stach the parts somewhere else with the risk of car parts stolen.
[5:34:37] enar_ixo: Put the key in the car, lock it and leave it on the driveway. I don't think that car can be lockpicked

[5:37:11] OkayyJake: probably just need to buy that separate burner property/trailer to be the dump for his parts, without jeopardising the others
[5:37:12] donazeri: unless it unlocks something else
[5:37:17] harucanne: Hopefuly the fence guy going to rewards 4head something

[5:40:03] iZeeMo: the fact that every car is 1200$ and that the money also has to be cleaned makes the chop chop job not that profitable but maybe in the future it can bring a new business and that's what 4head is counting on I believe

[7:52:29] GoutOfWar: SUSSY
[7:52:36] senlash: ?sub
[7:52:36] BotDoris: Hey there, you should subscribe to Nidas. America2 https://www.twitch.tv/subs/nidas
[7:52:37] HowdyAves: @conf1gs the bar we opened in Nashville was in 2017. We fortunately paid off the lease of the property and turned profit in the first year. was crazy
[7:52:56] HowdyAves: cocktail bars have good margins if you know what your doing
[7:52:59] anshu2907: is it still meta gaming if you are griefing needas Corpa
[7:53:12] Conf1gs: @HowdyAves yea a bar is different, but just a straight up restaurant is impossible here, every single restaurant I go to is heavily under-staffed lol
[7:53:22] PicklesDippedInRanch: Kappa

[7:53:29] HowdyAves: @conf1gs where you from? just curious
[7:53:37] Conf1gs: @HowdyAves Canadia
[7:54:12] santilloo88: @conf1gs funny that you just said that, sitting in a small restaurant in Sigtuna and just appreciated the staff. Thats why i always tip here. And no this time its a new staff and she is doing really well. Dont loose hope mate
[7:54:23] ViolenceOfDucks: wolfaUgh talking while eating

[7:54:52] Conf1gs: @santilloo88 I have no idea where Sigtuna is tbh LUL
[7:54:52] HowdyAves: understaffing is prevalent is the majority of places but the owners know it cheaper and easier for them to not staff enough people
[7:55:37] santilloo88: @conf1gs Just a town in Sweden. But i agree with you..
[7:55:51] HowdyAves: @santilloo88 that server is probably stressed the fuck out. I guarantee you that tip really relieved some of that.
[7:56:17] Conf1gs: @HowdyAves oh yea, but here it's not the owners being cheap, they literally can't hire anyone. One of my buddies has a restaurant and he's hired people and they don't even show up at their first day of work
[7:56:17] HowdyAves: I paid $25 for breakfast this morning Sadge

[7:57:03] Cactus_Juan: spain is mad cheap but people there also get paid way less then belgium for example
[7:57:32] HowdyAves: @conf1gs the no showing on their first day is so common holy shit. I hate it but once you work in this industry you understand. they probably applied to 10 different places and found a spot they want to work at more. still shitty to not call ahead though
[7:57:44] Tr3sk0: Sweden is just expensive, especially stockholm
[7:57:56] Conf1gs: @Ruppster_ I think a lot of places in EU the tip is already included when they bring you the invoice

[8:12:53] ErraticSwami: Guys. Materials were 0
[8:12:53] Zardete: The idea is that Lang pays Union members more than he pays other people for materials, at least it's how I think it works
[8:12:53] warkid123: the big thing at the start was the initial price. It was 0.4$ per mat ^^
[8:12:54] yalenv1: like the company
[8:12:57] realitijd24: its fun to see people becoming Aware

[8:13:05] ErraticSwami: 50 cents before the union
[8:13:12] carrioncorps: patar peepoHappy
[8:13:17] nessopito: think it's more union takes care of selling  bulk orders and union members have a reliable payment w/o having to hunt down potential buyers
[8:13:18] CinnbonSupaflav: i mean he got into it when people were buying for .50
[8:13:19] museumpiece: Once a mayor in place I think there will be lots of shifting with bizzes
[8:13:22] SchaFFFFFF: It's also a guaranteed price. While yes, it's less than market, the guaranteed price is better than trying to haggle

[8:13:58] museumpiece: Without meta yes
[8:14:07] ErraticSwami: Pooling mats made the market go crazy. Both lumber and sani were dead jobs before
[8:14:08] yeslewd: its probably a fast and reliable way to sell
[8:14:11] harucanne: Doing sani with patar is actually good, you can build up the rep and got many circuit boards
[8:14:12] fublian: I think since they only do it with other union members, it easy to find crews where everyone has high rep aswell so

[8:14:36] dizzledaz: @mattsinnit also everyone in the union is minimum 50 stars so they get way more minimum mats per run
[8:14:39] mattsinnit: said he misses u yesterday
