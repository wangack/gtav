[3:37:24] Diamon_Boots: Skaven?
[3:37:31] Diamon_Boots: But hey don't exist
[3:37:31] Goblocker: Guys are you a steam engine or diesel engine
[3:37:42] Dracolychee: Huh
[3:37:49] Grindzycat: Plot twist
[3:37:52] Dracolychee: LUL
[3:37:53] S_Scaggler: You're little reinforcements
[3:37:59] TigerPrascire: That's the military you just paid for
[3:38:11] TigerPrascire: There's a fun bug with those empire armies too
[3:38:16] Cindipool: 2k doesn't get you much.
[3:38:21] acnezebras: you should always auto resolve these battles
[3:38:32] DevilishDevourer: Believe in the knights!
[3:38:37] TheRinaldo: These empire battles are always a shit show
[3:38:39] Grindzycat: Ah yes, the Brass keep, my favorite Minigolf course
[3:38:40] beorrahn: Sometimes you get o keep these random armies though Ben, so you might get those knights and handgunners
[3:38:42] witcheriv: yogSog
[3:38:44] Oomffs: The Brass Keep is metaphorical
[3:38:47] Miguel_TheCell: tomatoKnife crikScheme crikRat crikRat crikRat crikRat
[3:38:53] Cindipool: A road and a ditch. The mightiest defences in the Empire.
[3:38:54] noodlesrevenge13: you don't have to win you. you still get the rewards on autoresolve or lose
[3:39:11] TigerPrascire: If you're playing multiplayer and your opponent selects "Play as AI" when you've sent an army to help another empire faction, they end up playing as your ally. Then they can just stand there and let your empire friend die a horrible death at the hands of their enemies
[3:39:30] Cindipool: Immediate knight charge. Can't go wrong.
[3:39:37] DevilishDevourer: But it'd be real cool to win.
[3:39:44] Qwaar_Jet_Khar: Yeah I aloways autoresolve these cause the outcome doesn't matter
[3:39:49] Qwaar_Jet_Khar: Always*
[3:40:01] SavageEvie: split forces though, good start

[3:40:24] Dracolychee: Gelt Centaur! PogChamp
[3:40:27] Cindipool: The bottom half is a glitched griffin.
[3:40:50] Diamon_Boots: We all know 8 legs is better then 6
[3:40:52] TigerPrascire: Be a centaur but the bottom half is Balthazar Gelt on all fours, and the top half is another Balthazar Gelt. This is Tom's new fetish
[3:40:53] DarkSnideOfTheRainbow: I feel like any amount of warp lighting is a bad amount
[3:40:53] Githerax: the horse part would be nothing more than an elaborate tail
[3:40:55] Stefnos: is there ever a good amount of warp lightning to get hit by
[3:41:03] Novus_Imperialis: Vulkan centaur sounds brilliant

[3:42:42] lukastunt: im guessing tom has seen hes on r/dankmemes in a toddy/tiktok crossover
[3:42:52] Cindipool: @Dracolychee Hihihi.
[3:43:04] Barnaby_Barnacle: surely hobgoblins are half hobbit
[3:43:09] MahonsTV: @TunstallGuitar isn't that just a repost of a repost though?
[3:43:10] Grindzycat: Aw poor Selwin had a rough dono unit to be his first Dono. Tom's magical collateral damage is unfortunate
[3:43:28] lukastunt: i havent seen it before tbh maybe it is
[3:43:34] Benersan: Hobgoblins are just Mongols, it's not even subtle
[3:43:48] WarlordGallus: but is they gobbos?
[3:44:05] tensia_: a_BIWC subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! much love, but how far behind on donations are these boys?
[3:44:11] lukastunt: hopefully he becomes a template Pog
[3:44:15] Benersan: Tall gobbos who make Skaven look trustworthy, they also all have Khan after their name
[3:44:17] Cindipool: The huntsman was soloing two blobs and winning.
[3:44:42] PinkPunisher: Not quite lol
[3:44:54] MahonsTV: @TunstallGuitar yep that is an OLD GIF from before tiktok
[3:45:00] Cindipool: Briefly winning.
