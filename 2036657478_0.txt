[5:44:12] retrowolf0498: A pit
[5:44:48] jimothy64: It's super gatekeeping. You wanna be a good decorator? You better have a bunch of friends willing to grind super rare resources..
[5:44:52] rentexz: I like it adds more rp and steps to it, first you gotta get the flooring done etc. Makes more sense construction cant be done on a house in 2 hours.
[5:45:40] Chiracho: KEKW
[5:46:20] jimothy64: @rentexz except it can if you're the decorator for a big gang or whatever with materials to spare. It just moves decorating away from being something anybody can try their hand at

[5:50:23] super_lb97: guess you cant take her on a bike ride lol she hurt herself badly lol
