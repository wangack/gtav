This may result to a time out or ban without warning. (Meta-gaming is when you tell Acie what a different streamer is doing on the same server) Thank you.

[0:36:42] Alaineman: @a_husky_ I haven't seen much of 3.0 but so far 4.0 has been major scuff.
[0:36:51] woulf76: CG vs the server
[0:36:51] Tenivir: what is that logic, robbing people of their materials until price goes down? that is not how supply and demand works
[0:37:04] Redoxok: SoCute
[0:37:06] dspadez112: WutFace WutFace WutFace
[0:37:13] adamm220: raia peepoHug
[0:37:13] etalag: @Tenivir true
[0:37:15] mryoussen: @dspadez112 gpus degrade so they are stuck doing sani forever
[0:37:16] Hi_Nike: veryCat
[0:37:16] HandofOdd: Early sani on non cooked brains finally
[0:37:17] mavericks312: do they realize the more they rob only raises the price not lower?
[0:37:20] nonnahshannon: Raia is SO CUTE
[0:37:23] BoJackJohnsson: 10 Raia mins
[0:37:25] x_amer__: 10 min clips

[0:37:26] nonnahshannon: I love her
[0:37:36] dspadez112: sani ResidentSleeper
[0:37:37] Dysotopia: it was stocked on purpose
[0:37:41] P51F144: someone planing ahead Pog
[0:37:45] xnevad: You could Ask jason to ride the white van, and put only a llittle in sani truck to give if robbed.
[0:37:49] x_amer__: damn the preparation
[0:37:53] goodenhi: Morning Acie have a great stream
[0:37:55] nosebeersx: they need to add another way to get materials. like turning in roof running stuff, or parts from car chopping etc. Having it all in sani just seems odd
[0:37:58] crazyiitopii: Making less supply makes demand go higher thus raising the prices CG is buggin
[0:38:03] Dysotopia: it was bought by clayton for everyone to use
[0:38:23] mavericks312: roof running should have a chance to give circuit boards
[0:38:24] x_amer__: and u both missed the event sadly
[0:38:27] Terrous10: Jason is going to stress it glizzies while you all do the heist
[0:38:27] Caeros: @Tenivir the logic is take it and not pay
[0:38:29] Joelmiika: What heist you doing?
[0:38:34] mryoussen: if they wanted to buy for 6 per they would’ve found peole to sell to them but its just talk

[0:38:38] willowompoo: daaamn organized
[0:38:48] mryoussen: they get them for free robbing them
[0:38:49] megasoy: cg has guns. until everyone gets guns they win every encounter pretty much.
[0:38:50] dspadez112: preparedness
[0:38:56] etalag: cg probably will be behind the buttcoins grinding if they keep it up all sani will not sell them any mats
[0:38:57] ramoj007: how much Mats did you get?
[0:38:59] jbt445: radios?
[0:39:00] Phasehero: I'm learning from Vader stream to not tell @acie what to do with Vee and it's refreshing

[0:40:04] willowompoo: still no personal key ICANT
[0:40:10] crazyiitopii: Makes sense Vader is right Meta can get your streamer banned
[0:40:11] IraqiMamba: DonkBonks

[0:40:18] Andy_D1: Jason steals the key and won't answer GIGACHAD
[0:40:19] bigdawg19: Just make yourself a Key already, u use the house the most
[0:40:22] Phasehero: @mryoussen oh I know. Hahaha that's why I said I have learned

[0:43:31] fnaskdas: LUL
[0:43:31] willowompoo: you use the house the most
[0:43:35] megasoy: @crazyiitopii it could be worse. cg is pretty fair. they dont take personal stuff. they try not to rob the same people more than once. etc.
[0:43:38] nonnahshannon: no key for you
[0:43:43] troyofathyns: I think they just don't want to spend the money for it

[0:44:23] crazyiitopii: @megasoy you mean fair like camping the heist spot? KEKW obvious they are allowed to shit that others aren't js

[3:04:33] Slaydess7: yeah, they are blaming you but what do you expect, no experience and new car
[3:04:33] koolcoach: That was a really good chase, it was just too many main roads were cops have the advantage
[3:04:35] VaeelL: testing stuff on heist shouldn't be a thing
[3:04:36] joyoruz: yep ur own car even pros cant drive diff car everytime

[3:04:48] crazyiitopii: Remember was Hazel said "Just have fun and don't worry" yall did good considering
[3:04:48] MrLebowski_: get into chases with the cops for dumb reasons like speeding
[3:04:48] burn_of_sky: @KooterNoodle the interceptors are tanks, need 5+ swaps atleast
[3:04:50] xLOWxKEYx: that car has no grip honestly so high speeds and turns is extremely difficult to handle
[3:04:51] chubby7339: bet her car was well fooked up to start with

[6:02:31] Dano_Leza: you would win the city

[6:02:33] AdamH1989: are ya upgrading racks and getting rid rubbish GPU
[6:02:35] ribs010: youd be at 300 in no time

[6:02:39] AmusedSmoke: didn't she leave the stuff in the machine or am i tripping ?
[6:02:40] joac1144: Personally I think Jason should stay a civ and stay at G6. I think it can have a lot of potential later
[6:02:47] RevillianGG: a sani empire lmao
[6:02:52] idfiatok69: he would grind the fuck out of this

[6:03:10] klepee: the most Susge idea om
[6:03:10] Fozzy_1473: and very dumb. the access keycard wouldnt be there
[6:03:11] AlexNattes: it is pointless that you can not do more than 1 job without losing rep
[6:03:14] thatdudedave20: If the robbing stops
[6:03:25] MPJT: tunee
[6:03:25] BuuCacky: I think Jason is better off with G6 since y'all still need someone bringing in decent income to the house
[6:03:27] Dano_Leza: now he’s going to see your struggles on how slow the rep goes up
[6:03:32] dan_osx: classic raia needing bandages
[6:03:36] nykter1: they wont stop robbing sani anytime soon

[6:04:00] yellowflash511: @Acie I HAVE MY MASTER'S RESULTS TOMORROW
[6:04:01] imshades: He Farms leaving g6 every other sentence. He gets everything he wants from the government @ g6. His push to keep crimson out killed the pool able to run g6.
[6:04:03] AdamH1989: g6 is rubbish money don’t know why people would do it grime is 100% better
[6:04:10] ekahS_: mhm

[6:04:32] ekahS_: mhm stupid money
[6:04:34] gruegd: Money is kind of useless at the moment though.
[6:04:34] Rockhound__97: They could control the market on the price
[6:04:35] AdamH1989: why server rack still have rubbish GPU in still
[6:04:36] adamm220: wish u could get circuit boards from heists
[6:04:39] chaosformula6957: Hmm
[6:04:41] SaltiBanana: its likely not sustainable tho
[6:04:42] Madknightwolf: Him and Clay should grind g6 for new house
[6:04:42] bigscott33: yeah 100% sani is so good 10per circuit board
[6:04:43] Crazyman114: if you guys could run 2 trucks of sani @Acie
[6:04:46] OneManWolfPac: hell yea mad inquiries
[6:04:54] Flashthatuuu: Thats true. But at the time G6 was the best job. THat flipped only recently
[6:04:54] Ginoveli: peepoPls
[6:04:55] nykter1: g6 doesnt earn that much anyway
[6:04:56] x_amer__: what about leaving the coins for the big dog and just sell all u get
[6:04:58] Setback1: a u guy have 400k+ and its a bit useless
[6:05:02] Rockhound__97: Sani = goldmine = cash or boards
[6:05:06] Dano_Leza: Jason can always grind back up to 300 if he really wants
[6:05:09] IggleGreen: 100%
[6:05:11] klepee: someone who works at sani will see the truck there and lockpick it om
[6:05:11] Tenivir: they kinda have to add more material sources
[6:05:13] Kenjack1984: with how prices of stuff keeps going up exponentially you will need more gpus
[6:05:16] SaltiBanana: also the less ppl that do g6 the better they will make it
[6:05:16] AdamH1989: how many GPU have ya made in 78 hours ?
[6:05:21] Praskle: the last run at 10 per is pretty much a T3 run
[6:05:21] IggleGreen: Car chopping should be that
[6:05:23] VoidanceMusic: they need to add more content for sani just like they did got g6
[6:05:23] AddyAdam: Grime would be my guess
[6:05:25] tradgie: can't you chop cart parts?
[6:05:27] raizzel_azzer: you should always keep some mats to sell
[6:05:27] nonnahshannon: acieWADDLE
[6:05:27] Crazyman114: Jason is ass manager though.
[6:05:29] kobayashimaru36: can u put car parts in the recycler?
[6:05:29] StreamElements: kobayashimaru36, no
[6:05:31] ublivious: ublivious is continuing the Gift Sub they got from gruegd! 
[6:05:33] Dumi90: yeah some crime like eugene said will have mats
[6:05:33] Dano_Leza: do you think that’s why the starts go up so slow?
[6:05:35] CHR0M0S0ME: civ jobs shouldn’t ruin other civ job rep.
[6:05:36] CRlCK: DinkDonk

[6:06:33] bigscott33: @Madknightwolf u can nunu tried did it at very very start with patar but it was awful
[6:07:06] Kenjack1984: stuff on the app went from 2 -3 butt coins then to 10 then to 50 and then to 250-300 the bigger the job the more gpus you will need unless you only want to do big jobs once a month.
[6:07:06] x_amer__: leave th stuff in the van no ?
[6:07:10] WithExtraSauce: Ain’t no way you’re doing trash
