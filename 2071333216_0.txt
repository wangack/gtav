[0:36:42] Alaineman: @a_husky_ I haven't seen much of 3.0 but so far 4.0 has been major scuff.
[0:36:51] woulf76: CG vs the server
[0:36:51] Tenivir: what is that logic, robbing people of their materials until price goes down? that is not how supply and demand works
[0:37:04] Redoxok: SoCute
[0:37:06] dspadez112: WutFace WutFace WutFace
[0:37:13] adamm220: raia peepoHug
[0:37:13] etalag: @Tenivir true
[0:37:15] mryoussen: @dspadez112 gpus degrade so they are stuck doing sani forever
[0:37:16] Hi_Nike: veryCat
[0:37:16] HandofOdd: Early sani on non cooked brains finally
[0:37:17] mavericks312: do they realize the more they rob only raises the price not lower?

[0:37:36] dspadez112: sani ResidentSleeper
[0:37:37] Dysotopia: it was stocked on purpose
[0:37:41] P51F144: someone planing ahead Pog
[0:37:45] xnevad: You could Ask jason to ride the white van, and put only a llittle in sani truck to give if robbed.
[0:37:49] x_amer__: damn the preparation
[0:37:53] goodenhi: Morning Acie have a great stream
[0:37:55] nosebeersx: they need to add another way to get materials. like turning in roof running stuff, or parts from car chopping etc. Having it all in sani just seems odd
[0:37:58] crazyiitopii: Making less supply makes demand go higher thus raising the prices CG is buggin
[0:38:03] Dysotopia: it was bought by clayton for everyone to use
[0:38:23] mavericks312: roof running should have a chance to give circuit boards
[0:38:24] x_amer__: and u both missed the event sadly
[0:38:27] Terrous10: Jason is going to stress it glizzies while you all do the heist
[0:38:27] Caeros: @Tenivir the logic is take it and not pay
[0:38:29] Joelmiika: What heist you doing?
[0:38:34] mryoussen: if they wanted to buy for 6 per they would‚Äôve found peole to sell to them but its just talk

[0:38:38] willowompoo: daaamn organized
[0:38:48] mryoussen: they get them for free robbing them
[0:38:49] megasoy: cg has guns. until everyone gets guns they win every encounter pretty much.
[0:38:50] dspadez112: preparedness
[0:38:56] etalag: cg probably will be behind the buttcoins grinding if they keep it up all sani will not sell them any mats
[0:38:57] ramoj007: how much Mats did you get?
[0:38:59] jbt445: radios?

[0:43:31] fnaskdas: LUL
[0:43:31] willowompoo: you use the house the most
[0:43:35] megasoy: @crazyiitopii it could be worse. cg is pretty fair. they dont take personal stuff. they try not to rob the same people more than once. etc.
[0:43:38] nonnahshannon: no key for you
[0:43:43] troyofathyns: I think they just don't want to spend the money for it

[3:04:32] IVoDI_Mz: @Acie Nora gave a fun idea, next time yall do heists, everyone should have a heart rate monitor for fun KEKW
[3:04:33] Slaydess7: yeah, they are blaming you but what do you expect, no experience and new car
[3:04:33] koolcoach: That was a really good chase, it was just too many main roads were cops have the advantage
[3:04:35] VaeelL: testing stuff on heist shouldn't be a thing
[3:04:36] joyoruz: yep ur own car even pros cant drive diff car everytime

[3:04:48] crazyiitopii: Remember was Hazel said "Just have fun and don't worry" yall did good considering
[3:04:48] MrLebowski_: get into chases with the cops for dumb reasons like speeding
[3:04:48] burn_of_sky: @KooterNoodle the interceptors are tanks, need 5+ swaps atleast
[3:04:50] xLOWxKEYx: that car has no grip honestly so high speeds and turns is extremely difficult to handle
[3:04:51] chubby7339: bet her car was well fooked up to start with

[6:04:56] x_amer__: what about leaving the coins for the big dog and just sell all u get
[6:04:58] Setback1: a u guy have 400k+ and its a bit useless
[6:05:02] Rockhound__97: Sani = goldmine = cash or boards
[6:05:06] Dano_Leza: Jason can always grind back up to 300 if he really wants
[6:05:09] IggleGreen: 100%
[6:05:11] klepee: someone who works at sani will see the truck there and lockpick it om
[6:05:11] Tenivir: they kinda have to add more material sources
[6:05:13] Kenjack1984: with how prices of stuff keeps going up exponentially you will need more gpus
[6:05:16] SaltiBanana: also the less ppl that do g6 the better they will make it
[6:05:16] AdamH1989: how many GPU have ya made in 78 hours ?
[6:05:21] Praskle: the last run at 10 per is pretty much a T3 run
[6:05:21] IggleGreen: Car chopping should be that
[6:05:23] VoidanceMusic: they need to add more content for sani just like they did got g6
[6:05:23] AddyAdam: Grime would be my guess
[6:05:25] tradgie: can't you chop cart parts?
[6:05:27] raizzel_azzer: you should always keep some mats to sell

[6:07:06] Kenjack1984: stuff on the app went from 2 -3 butt coins then to 10 then to 50 and then to 250-300 the bigger the job the more gpus you will need unless you only want to do big jobs once a month.
[6:07:06] x_amer__: leave th stuff in the van no ?

[8:53:27] IggleGreen: Brother Nick would be the Patar/Larry
[8:53:33] Villenthessis: oh yeah, and Tolan too
[8:53:36] SaltiBanana: @bigscott33, thats is totally ignoring the possibility of g6 getting new stuff/buffed
[8:53:36] ragefilleddonut: tolan modCheck
[8:53:36] Freppuchino: civ gang needs to start running with Tolan
[8:53:54] ZitroneSimo: Tolan has a bad train ticket

[8:54:28] Dumi90: clay is right
[8:54:30] napkin4872: 69
[8:54:31] BoJackJohnsson: 4 per h is 96
[8:54:32] AFFABLE__: But with civ gang you keep all mats, with others you gotta share mats.
[8:54:35] SSGHaseeb: 30 hour for 50 stars
[8:54:36] PRE5TO_: the guy that did the 24hr sani went from 12 to 59

[8:55:57] KaBoomGodTV: how are u not 300 then
[8:56:03] j_pandy: you said 3 hours?
[8:56:10] AFFABLE__: Larry visits the sani yard at least 3 times more often per hour.
[8:56:14] SaltiBanana: @bigscott33, well i doubt they would leave them so obsolete
[8:56:15] Acheron13: Jason barely got robbed doing G6 too
[8:56:23] napkin4872: just get urself 3 wow players LULE
