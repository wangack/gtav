[0:45:52] dopeboytee: GTA RP is like basically extra-long form media as the story's often run for weeks/months and streams are often long due the nature of the content being played out
[0:45:54] x_Masna: whose crotch we touching?
[0:45:55] Nohitzki: I found the video from James w/ Klutch regarding European distribution btw, tagged y‚Äôall on Twitter. just fyi hisandhersLogo
[0:46:08] GigaChadillac: Timmy & Tammy 4 LYFE!
[0:46:18] BleachDrinka: you guys made me get into rp. at first i would stop watchingafter apex but noww gta is my fave part
[0:46:27] jdub610: the reason I want to play. just need to set it up
[0:46:31] GigaChadillac: tennis...
[0:46:39] LawAndOrder: You a layman aint never beating a tennis pro
[0:46:40] DFGrumpy: better chance at darts.. no stamina required.
[0:46:44] Fostethesnowman: Darts is harder
[0:46:45] ImEtherMX: The UK makes a debate about anything LUL
[0:46:47] LawAndOrder: Absolutely never
[0:46:47] pepperbeeman: No shot at either but you could get lucky in darts
[0:46:48] DeadlyStrafe: @bleachdrinka same
[0:46:51] GigaChadillac: you can be slightly drunk and play darts like a pro....You cant be drunk playing tennis

[0:46:59] imfirekicks: more movement of the full body
[0:47:08] Nohitzki: tennis is pvp, darts is playing against yourself
[0:47:10] navyreaper69: That's not true at all juka darts are so much precision
[0:47:14] imfirekicks: darts way easier for sure yeah
[0:47:18] pepperbeeman: 99.9% couldn't return 1 serve
[0:47:23] Fostethesnowman: LOVE means nothing to a Tennis player
[0:47:31] Geppetto404: Darts takes so much more focus. Accuracy is ESSENTIAL and doing it repeatedly is not easy. Tennis has a higher chance at luck factor
[0:47:31] dopeboytee: Argument involved you get to serve / throw first, and the argument is that there more room for error from the professional darts player
[0:47:37] GigaChadillac: darts is coordination with stance and precision. All upper body movement. Tennis is full body movement
[0:47:47] ImEtherMX: I think the way darts is played and the rules makes it harder for sure.
[0:47:48] DeadlyStrafe: Probably not but I'll be able to hit the tennis ball at least
[0:47:54] navyreaper69: It's not just a dart on a board ... it's darts in specific spots on a board
[0:48:05] DFGrumpy: Watching the Australian open now.. no way I could do 1/16 of what these players do. But I can throw a dart and get lucky.
[0:48:09] GigaChadillac: Tennis is about quick decisions
[0:48:12] ImEtherMX: But accuracy wise, it's easier to play darts drunk
[0:48:15] DeadlyStrafe: You're comparing a dart anywhere to hitting specific shots in tennis
[0:48:23] GigaChadillac: tennis is no luck as compared to darts
[0:48:26] DeadlyStrafe: I'm gonna eventually be able to get one serve in
[0:48:26] Nohitzki: I bet I could score a point in the nba. Djoker>Lebron
[0:48:30] durk8lizzyjoe: Good evening everyone
[0:48:30] pepperbeeman: In Tennis, you're not hitting the serve or the return
[0:48:31] LawAndOrder: a layman aint never returning a serve from a pro, or even hit a serve inbounds
[0:48:34] ImEtherMX: @navyreaper69 yes... that
[0:48:38] flyyoufewls: MUM AND DAD ARE HOME MISSED YALL CHAT hisandhersLovely hisandhersJudyLove hisandhersLover
[0:48:38] StreamElements: hisandhersLovely
[0:48:40] DeadlyStrafe: That's not the point of darts either lol
[0:48:42] Fostethesnowman: I always get it in okay andrew
[0:48:43] dopeboytee: Pro darts players consistently hitting 140s/180s and being on checkout whilst you are still to get 200+ means you have to hope the pro misses 9 to 12 darts in a row which ISN'T happening
[0:49:14] navyreaper69: Andrew can you bowl a 300 ??
[0:49:23] pepperbeeman: 99.9% couldn't return a serve from a good high school tennis player
[0:49:24] ImEtherMX: There more chance in tennis the pro player falls and breaks their leg, then you win be default right?
[0:49:36] Geppetto404: If I had to choose either, I'd take my odds in Tennis any day of the week
[0:49:37] navyreaper69: And I can dart and bowl ... I can't tennis
[0:49:41] akrodzen: That's not the question... the question is could you win a match against a pro... in both cases it's no but more chance in tennis that Darts I think
[0:49:44] LawAndOrder: the odds of you even getting your racket on a serve are astronomically low
[0:49:48] Nohitzki: mm once you learn to watch the right part of a tennis players body, I think plenty of ppl could get a racket on a ball that‚Äôs sent their way
[0:49:49] imfirekicks: so then the dart pro hurts his wrist?
[0:49:51] imfirekicks: lol
[0:49:53] GigaChadillac: Tennis blends athleticism and strategy, with luck in ball bounces. Darts rely on precision, demanding accuracy and finesse for consistent success. Your pick: dynamic tennis or laser-like darts?
[0:50:00] Nohitzki: not easy, but do-able
[0:50:01] dopeboytee: The debate shifted to which would require the least amount of training to succeed?
[0:50:13] pepperbeeman: LUL
[0:50:17] jayknaves: Depends who you ask
[0:50:18] DFGrumpy: I could take a t-rex easy.. :)
[0:50:20] Nohitzki: trex got them baby arms tho
[0:50:23] GigaChadillac: I just imagined Trex playing tennis with them smoll hands LUL LUL LUL
[0:50:35] BleachDrinka: i could fuck up a trex
[0:50:35] ZSwordlink: lol
[0:50:46] DFGrumpy: thats what she said ... LUL
[0:50:49] ImEtherMX: Darts Is kinda stationary sport, usually with beers and bar foods üòÇ BUT the darts players are usually obese so maybe a heart attack will get em mid game on the flip side
[0:50:52] Nohitzki: have y‚Äôall seen that book ‚ÄúT-rex tries?‚Äù so goddam funny
[0:51:02] GigaChadillac: T-rex vs triceratops in tennis. I need an AI to recreate this LOL
[0:51:02] pepperbeeman: You should look up stats from surveys about what size animal men think they could handle
[0:51:08] ZSwordlink: so its juka's height lol
[0:51:09] navyreaper69: @juka_hisandherslive my gf was giving me shit for all the times I've trolled Andrew with rules and I told her it's because of him.. she is now confused... can you explain what was the thing Andrew did to me that made me be on your side and not Andrew's?
[0:51:12] ZSwordlink: JK I LOVE YOU JUKA
[0:51:13] GigaChadillac: @Nohitzki YESS! HAHA
[0:51:16] imfirekicks: @ZSwordlink lol
[0:51:20] ZSwordlink: lol
[0:51:23] JudeMF: SWORDLINK HAI
[0:51:31] Nohitzki: @gigachadillac gets it! hisandhersKekw hisandhersKekw hisandhersKekw
[0:51:35] GigaChadillac: t-rex catches the tennis ball in match. Trex LOVE
[0:51:36] ZSwordlink: JUDE HI
[0:51:43] Sammyrai90: OMG HIIIIIIII
[0:51:47] dopeboytee: @pepperbeeman absolutely stupid numbers of men think they could beat bears, gorilla's and chimps üòÇüòÇüòÇ
[0:52:00] Nohitzki: can that be the 6 year badge? trex playing tennis?
[0:52:15] jayknaves: T-rex I reckon is easier beat in a fight than godzilla lol
[0:52:20] pepperbeeman: @dopeboytee I know right?! People think they could survive a wolf, croc attack etc
[0:52:33] 1crazy1bonnie: Sounds like a neesie
[0:52:36] navyreaper69: You chanced down the rez every time Andrew
[0:52:38] v3ter4n: @hisandherslive hey andrew, idk if youve already made one but you should make a video of clips starting from your first apex stream with juka to now, documenting the journey üòä
[0:52:49] 7MinOfTerror: I mean even if it's not the same person >_>
[0:52:55] dopeboytee: @pepperbeeman so stupid, literally most dogs if they really wanted to get you they could üòÇüòÇ
[0:53:12] TalkSickGirl: Y'all inspired me the other day and now I've been sitting in on streams with people who have fewer than 100 viewers.
[0:53:28] cookiewarlord10: juka me and u got to get redemption against Andrew next random royale

[0:53:28] StreamElements: How to Signup for FURIA Apex Academy Events: https://apex.furia.gg/   YT Video Here: https://youtu.be/kJeZ3CcufRQ
[0:53:34] GigaChadillac: 
[0:53:38] TalkSickGirl: It's soooo wholesome and I love it. Everyone is so nice and there are soooo many really good players who just don't have a following yet.
[0:53:52] navyreaper69: I hate apex as well .. I'm uninstalling
[0:53:57] jayknaves: 5year hype
[0:54:03] flyyoufewls: I would watch the shit out of a through the years compilation YouTube vid
[0:54:05] GigaChadillac: Juka, I'm slightly salty about how you came into Apex so early while I've been playing since day 1 and SUCK
[0:54:05] v3ter4n: @hisandherslive thats why i mentioned it because of the 5 years..the journey of jukas gaming and this channel would make for a good montage/clip video
[0:54:10] uhhhdeenuhhh: Apex is my first FPS game
[0:54:23] TalkSickGirl: I struggled a lot when I first started playing apex because I wasn't used to healing.
[0:54:23] Nohitzki: Hi5AndHer5Five
[0:54:26] Sicilian247: its the pace of the game that i enjoy the most
[0:54:31] Fostethesnowman: Then you fell in love with Hope
[0:54:37] dopeboytee: Chat does anyone know why I'm getting gifted subs to channels I've literally never even heard of or seen? Is this common?
[0:54:39] TalkSickGirl: Coming from BO2 it was tough and I didn't get decent teaching when I started.
[0:54:43] GigaChadillac: My 1st fps was Doom back in the '90s. My 1st fast-paced FPS was Unreal Tourney.
[0:54:46] Sicilian247: like cod feels plastic
[0:54:51] 7MinOfTerror: I just woke up from a nap and in the dream I had, Andrew told me he was disappointed in how I was using my gifted sub LUL
[0:54:54] P_Diggity: Blackout was SO good!!!
[0:54:56] Sicilian247: to me
[0:55:12] ImEtherMX: Blackout was way more fun, even better when they added the zombies
[0:55:13] v3ter4n: apex is SORTA easy to learn but theres a really high skill ceiling
[0:55:18] TalkSickGirl: I started in season 14 and I only got "pick up guns and shoot"

[0:55:23] Nohitzki: @7minofterror sounds about right
[0:55:23] 7MinOfTerror: LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
[0:55:25] TalkSickGirl: I've come a long way since then.
[0:55:43] dopeboytee: I played apex at release for about 2 hours and then instantly went back to rainbow R6, I tried R6 a couple weeks ago and afters 2 hours had to go back to apex as gameplay was so slow and
[0:55:45] GigaChadillac: COD has too much data and GACHA. Much more of a toxic community too.
[0:55:48] jayknaves: @dopeboytee I get it All time today I was gifted 13 subs in 13 channels I never heard of
[0:55:53] Fostethesnowman: Bezos picks them himself. Not random
[0:56:03] Nohitzki: ^
[0:56:04] DFGrumpy: @Fostethesnowman facts

[0:56:38] 7MinOfTerror: Gatcha is the gambling to pull resources for characters in those games like Genshin
[0:56:39] navyreaper69: Amd I'm still silver
[0:56:42] durk8lizzyjoe: Got my second heirloom yesterday
[0:56:56] dopeboytee: TDM and Control so good for practicing fighting on apex
[0:56:58] Nohitzki: I think the algorithm determines who is most likely to spend money on twitch to gift the random subs tbh. I have no basis for this, just a gut feeling.
[0:57:06] v3ter4n: yea you two should give someone in stream whose good at making videos, all or some of your vods so they can make an epic journey montage @hisandherslive
[0:57:23] ImEtherMX: I'm probably one of the only people who really loved the first jumpsuit cod, advanced warfare.. it was the sound of the MORS sniper in that. Kinda sounded like a better triple take
[0:57:25] Nohitzki: !youtube
[0:57:25] StreamElements: https://www.youtube.com/HisandHersLive
[0:57:42] GigaChadillac: Juka, I want to watch you play "Those Who Remain" whenever Andrew clocks out
[0:57:47] pepperbeeman: @Nohitzki I think that's correct cause I get random subs from channels I've gifted all the time but rarely from channels I've never spent in
[0:57:48] dopeboytee: @nohitzki my financial history would strongly agree as I am HELLA financially irresponsible hahaha
[0:58:04] ZSwordlink: if any of you more newbies in chat that weren't here for the subathon here's one of their old yt vods of juka learning apex https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBMZZhX-Vfc&list=PLMiqwECgR0X8OrB1zWOWWq_xK5IrpOQ7E&index=8

[1:02:44] 7MinOfTerror: can we talk for a moment about how everyone hates pub trios because it's just constantly getting sworded
[1:02:52] NiFTy_HEadShOT: It shows for ppl who purchase it but they will randomly turn someone's box into a one Wong angle box if you haven't bought it. Thunk it's just trying to show you what it is trying ti push you to buy it lol
[1:02:53] v3ter4n: a duel weild legend would be nice

[1:03:03] Sicilian247: ive seen some weird loot boxes lately, like 4 blocks on the sides is that a glitch in the Apex matrix?

[1:04:54] GigaChadillac: @jayknaves Tell the aliens to bring me to Ireland. I can't afford a plane ticket
[1:05:07] v3ter4n: you guys should redoo that goat thing, have the goat voice but with andrew making the face hisandhersAndrewLul hisandhersAndrewLul
[1:05:12] DFGrumpy: Twitch still isn't profitable so they are just bleeding money.
[1:05:16] GigaChadillac: @dopeboytee Yes! Also, Rockos Modern Life. Did you know Rocko's day job was a sex operator?
[1:05:27] jayknaves: @gigachadillac if your close to miami could have asked them take yah here lol
[1:05:30] 7MinOfTerror: kick is not
[1:05:33] dopeboytee: Didn't they recently announce that twitch is still not currently in profit?
[1:05:36] DFGrumpy: Kick is losing money faster than twitch
[1:05:41] Geppetto404: Kick has never and will never release finances
[1:05:43] GigaChadillac: @jayknaves I got that reference. Dam son
[1:05:57] v3ter4n: the amount of servers needed to host this many streams is really expensive @hisandherslive
[1:05:57] GigaChadillac: Twitch too busy paying you fools out
[1:05:59] NiFTy_HEadShOT: The company that owns kick is loaded. It's a gambling app
[1:06:04] DFGrumpy: Kick is a giant gambling add
[1:06:11] dopeboytee: @gigachadillac I'll be honest they must be US shows I don't know about
[1:06:12] akrodzen: samething as barstool and penn
[1:06:28] 7MinOfTerror: it  depends on the number of viewers because a big part of it is bandwidth
[1:06:36] v3ter4n: im sure twitch doesn't post the operation cost per channel
[1:06:38] DFGrumpy: The cost of the server farms is super high.
[1:06:51] jayknaves: @nohitzki ireland is not best country in world all you will see is green and more green some coast line alot pigs sheep cows no aliens and lot of us drunk mfs
[1:06:53] GigaChadillac: Kick's company name is the irony in how they deal with their customers
[1:06:54] jayknaves: LUL LUL LUL
[1:06:57] v3ter4n: what andrew said
[1:07:13] 7MinOfTerror: well, they limit that somewhat by not doing transcoding until you hit a certain number of followers
[1:07:15] DFGrumpy: That would be super hard to quantify juka.
[1:07:21] pharaohzop: its frre
[1:07:24] 7MinOfTerror: transcoding is very expensive
[1:07:28] v3ter4n: if EVERY streamer had 500 viewers every stream, twitch would probably be profitable
[1:07:34] GigaChadillac: @jayknaves Do you have to let it linger? :pun intended:
[1:07:41] dopeboytee: But surely the dollar amount twitch makes off there contact splits for subs ect must be pretty solid in its own right never mind what they make from advertisers
[1:07:50] pepperbeeman: servers are huge racks that get partitioned into virtual servers. So one rack could be like 20 servers
[1:07:53] Nohitzki: @jayknaves oh I know, I visited a few years ago. family is from County Westmeath!
[1:07:56] NiFTy_HEadShOT: Don't forget. You never know who these companies are in bed with. It's not transparent at all
[1:07:59] pepperbeeman: or 100 depending on hardware
[1:08:00] tinkerbell521: Well how many non-affiliate are there on twitch? Non-affiliates make them no money but are an entrance to get people onto twitch
[1:08:06] pharaohzop: theres cost
[1:08:19] 7MinOfTerror: @pepperbeeman uhhhh yeah your numbers are off by orders of magnitude
[1:08:24] GigaChadillac: In a big country, dreams stay with you.....
[1:08:32] jayknaves: @gigachadillac wait what did I left lingering lol
[1:08:45] tinkerbell521: So a non-affiliate would have to pay to stream?
[1:08:55] v3ter4n: @hisandherslive if you think about JUST the aoex channels, at any given time theres probably 10-25 streams with more than 300 viewers, and probably 100 that barely scratch 50-100 concurrent
[1:08:59] pepperbeeman: @7MinOfTerror I'm not giving numbers I'm just giving a theoretical example. I've sold $Ms worth of servers
[1:09:00] 7MinOfTerror: yeah, MLM lol
[1:09:00] Nohitzki: bleeding love > bleeding money
[1:09:04] jayknaves: @gigachadillac forgive if I miss anything I'm high asf and drinking lmao
[1:09:05] Nohitzki: allegedly
[1:09:21] GigaChadillac: @jayknaves It's a Cranberries reference. I'm a musician so my bad for losing you on that song lyric
[1:09:22] dopeboytee: Was it twitch that began as Justin.tv?
[1:09:24] Geppetto404: You ask anyone to have to pay to be able to stream they'll 100% leave the platform
[1:09:49] DFGrumpy: Most streams have very low viewers. So those streams cost Twitch money that the big streams can't balance out.
[1:09:52] DeadlyStrafe: Yeah, that would be a terrible idea
[1:09:55] GigaChadillac: Kick is going to "Kick" themselves in the ass soon
[1:09:59] TelegraphTrain: Those are some high gatekeeping points of view.  Closing the door behind you since you're past the threshold
[1:10:04] v3ter4n: yea ive been here since justintv
[1:10:19] DFGrumpy: Twitch is somewhere around 75+% of the online streaming viewership.
[1:10:21] DeadlyStrafe: @v3ter4n same
[1:10:26] jayknaves: @gigachadillac I k OW it was I was just in my head
[1:10:37] DeadlyStrafe: Twitch doesn't have to be profitable. It's a write off for Amazon since they bought it
[1:10:39] tinkerbell521: But if twitch is non-profitable then how is Kick profitable?
[1:10:52] StreamElements: While Donations, Bits & Subs are the preferred way to support the stream if you want to send us a gift here is our wishlist. https://throne.com/hisandherslive
[1:10:54] Geppetto404: Twitch is the only platform that offers discoverability. Youtube is longevity and longform, TikTok and Instagram are only useful for shorts and drawing interest in content
[1:10:55] DFGrumpy: @tinkerbell521 its not.
[1:10:55] tjohnson985: kick will buy twitch
[1:11:00] GigaChadillac: @jayknaves Pass the blunt to me next.
[1:11:04] dopeboytee: It should be transparent to streamers upon creating an account than in order for it to be viable you won't be able to cash out until you're consistently generating so much a stream
[1:11:09] DeadlyStrafe: @tjohnson985 no shit
[1:11:22] StreamElements: CRAZY SOUND ALERTS FOR BITS!!! ..... info panel at the bottom for all details.
[1:11:23] DeadlyStrafe: No shot* @tjohnson985
[1:11:25] Geppetto404: @dopeboytee That's how it is though
[1:11:29] NiFTy_HEadShOT: We knew twitch was doing bad when they came out with all those strick rules a few months ago then they had to go back on half them and apologize lol
[1:11:33] Nohitzki: what‚Äôs he last ice cream left in your Neapolitan ice cream tub? hypothetically
[1:11:33] DFGrumpy: @tjohnson985 they don't have that many billions.
[1:11:36] tinkerbell521: If they expect people to grow then they need to allow more discoverability to small 0-15 viewer streamers
[1:11:40] akrodzen: small streamers aren't the problem... it's the top 10-30 streamers that have these mega contracts they have to pay for... look at amazons 10-k's
[1:11:44] GigaChadillac: I just became best friends with @jayknaves LUL LUL
[1:11:52] Fostethesnowman: @tinkerbell521 We have the same thought
[1:12:06] dopeboytee: @geppetto404 I don't stream just a viewer so wasn't aware üôÇ
[1:12:06] NiFTy_HEadShOT: Facebook finally cut all partnerships
[1:12:10] ImEtherMX: @nohitzki chocolate
[1:12:14] NiFTy_HEadShOT: Dunno if yall saw that
[1:12:19] GigaChadillac: Taking Abbey for a walk and I'll come back to run some rounds with you
[1:12:23] Nohitzki: @imethermx oh no
[1:12:27] tinkerbell521: Discoverability on twitch for small single digit streamers is brutal
[1:12:29] tjohnson985: @dfgrumpy but they will, and might not need billions if everyone switches to kick like they have been
[1:12:30] dopeboytee: Where the Mixer crew at? üòÇüòÇüòÇ
[1:12:47] tinkerbell521: They did say they are stopping contracts
[1:12:50] jayknaves: @gigachadillac il pass next one need roll it whiskey on menu right now
[1:12:54] jayknaves: LUL
[1:13:18] Sm1ff74: Juka, it normally does!!
[1:13:29] Nohitzki: phrasing
[1:13:31] Sm1ff74: LUL
[1:13:32] GigaChadillac: @jayknaves whiskey on the menu!? What about whiskey on the bottle?
[1:13:36] tinkerbell521: They lost money on the contracts
[1:13:38] v3ter4n: whose a mod here??
[1:13:50] Nohitzki: @v3ter4n hisandhersKekw
[1:13:50] ImEtherMX: @nohitzki  you asked üòÖ I hate chocolate ice cream
[1:13:55] tinkerbell521: The CEO said they will no longer offer those contracts
[1:13:58] jayknaves: @nohitzki I was in meath 2weeks ago lol I live up north in county tyrone
[1:14:11] v3ter4n: @nohitzki are you a mod?? do they have mods? lol
[1:14:15] Nohitzki: @imethermx fair enough, I respect your opinion TwitchUnity
[1:14:19] GigaChadillac: @jayknaves Stay off that meth bro LMAO

[1:14:41] Sm1ff74: @v3ter4n @ZSwordlink @KayRoscoe
[1:14:55] Nohitzki: @jayknaves hell yes brother
[1:14:58] DFGrumpy: @tjohnson985 Twitch has 3-5 million daily viewers... kick is below a mill Everyone is not moving.
[1:14:59] pepperbeeman: they want those Fortnite kids
[1:14:59] GigaChadillac: No mods online!? Time to get nasty child
[1:15:08] v3ter4n: @zswordlink buddy!!! question, do i need permission to post a link?
[1:15:20] 7MinOfTerror: I don't think there are enough advertisers though - I see the same ads over and over
[1:15:22] jayknaves: @gigachadillac never touched that shit only devil's lettuce
[1:15:22] dopeboytee: What apex tournaments are actually ea endorsed?
[1:15:32] tinkerbell521: The CEO said recently that they are stopping all contracts
[1:15:33] ZSwordlink: @v3ter4n you can post a link
[1:15:36] NiFTy_HEadShOT: He's the guy that Kick's parent gambling app paid 7mil to stream him gambling isn't it

[2:03:05] laloggiadelcinghiale: 16 raiders from laloggiadelcinghiale have joined! 
[2:03:06] fry_el_wason28: first, communication through facial expression, and second, prevention of sweat, water, and other debris from falling down into the eye socket.
[2:03:07] JustDesi423: eyebrows blocking sand LUL
[2:03:08] Nohitzki: brows are for keeping sweat out of your eyes maybe?
[2:03:17] JacobsWifeLive: it‚Äôs like the videos you see where someone‚Äôs car nearly gets hit by a massive rock. that‚Äôs us but with debris from a mud slide on a side of a mountain :)

[2:04:13] JacobsWifeLive: Juka got me on a national park tangentü§£
[2:04:14] JustDesi423: The reason why we have eyebrows was originally to keep rain and sweat out of our eyes. As a species we humans rely on our sight more than any other sense, and and with no eyebrows water can get in and seriously blur vision. Eyebrows may also deflect debris and shield our eyes from the Sun.
[2:04:16] Nohitzki: @jacobswifelive saints decor in your office!
[2:04:19] skelly_goon: yup
[2:04:23] Nohitzki: gonna lurk for a bit

[2:04:39] JacobsWifeLive: @nohitzki ahhh, you wanna see the whole room?
[2:04:51] JustDesi423: I need someone to shave both their eyebrows off and test this theory..
[2:04:52] mickey_mishap: @JustDesi423 doin research out here
[2:04:54] GigaChadillac: Eyebrows serve several functions, including preventing sweat from reaching the eyes, reducing glare from the sun, and aiding in non-verbal communication.
[2:05:08] JustDesi423: .. will sweat get in your eyes easier? Will you see the sun more?
[2:05:19] JustDesi423: @mickey_mishap LUL I was curious because people look so silly without eyebrows
[2:05:22] StreamElements: New YT Vid 11/11/23 - We discuss season 19, is it any good? https://youtu.be/EQf08SZKjXs

[2:05:41] fry_el_wason28: @JustDesi423 sweat would trickle down directly into your eyes without them
[2:05:46] GigaChadillac: true question is, why do we have pubic hair other than to keep our genitals warm!?
[2:05:47] ranger_gang559: I‚Äôm trying to send in my stats but they said I need season 18 stats and I have like non I just started playing again
[2:05:49] Mo_Fraz: @JustDesi423  you need to post pic in discord after you shave them off
[2:05:59] JustDesi423: @mickey_mishap you never realize how important eyebrows are until you see those photos of people without them lol
[2:06:14] JustDesi423: @fry_el_wason28 yeah that makes sense - they have a purpose!

[2:49:55] GigaChadillac: you can't cash it but invest them in your biz
[2:49:55] yesterdaetv: some stores need pennies
[2:49:57] Immortalyze: !gamble all
[2:49:58] StreamElements: Immortalyze went all in and lost every single one of their 13158 Honey LUL
[2:49:59] fry_el_wason28: Andrew all you have to do is roll the pennies and its not hard to spend them
[2:50:09] papabatt_: Ranked is stupid
[2:50:30] yesterdaetv: theres like 17k more masters this season than last season..
[2:50:33] GigaChadillac: use 100k pennies to buy an automation machine to count the rest for you
[2:50:37] papabatt_: I'm gold 1
[2:50:41] papabatt_: I fight preds
[2:50:50] GoodLookingSean: heard that i was getting rolled by the 215 pred doing my silver trials haha
[2:50:57] GoodLookingSean: (that was greek at the time haha)
[2:51:06] pepperbeeman: It's like that for me too. It's the dumbest shit ever
[2:51:36] blmeek: harder to do solo queue ranked now too
[2:51:37] papabatt_: the rank next to your name is meaningless now
[2:51:42] DFGrumpy: Ranked seemed to have gone to shit when they changed the point system a couple seasons ago.
[2:51:48] pepperbeeman: Everybody is getting their own ranked relative to their level so they're not equal anymore
[2:52:00] yesterdaetv: 13 was the HARDEST season to hit masters
[2:52:06] pepperbeeman: They combined accounts tho
[2:52:17] fry_el_wason28: my queue times now are fucking brutal
[2:52:18] yesterdaetv: there was only like 5k masters 1st split 13...
[2:52:33] flyyybye: changing ranked every new season is also pretty annoying
[2:52:41] DFGrumpy: Ranked is so bad.. been hard stuck rookie for years.
[2:52:57] blmeek: too much work for EA
[2:53:07] fry_el_wason28: or Andrew hear me out.... if im in diamond i should only play against diamond players :)
[2:53:13] papabatt_: 12 was stupid
[2:53:21] JudeMF: 12 was def easy
[2:53:22] StreamElements: New YT Vid 11/11/23 - We discuss season 19, is it any good? https://youtu.be/EQf08SZKjXs
[2:53:46] fry_el_wason28: not in D3 playing against Complexity's pro team
[2:53:49] yesterdaetv: agree Juka
[2:54:01] yesterdaetv: theres almost 45k masters on PC right now
[2:54:11] chihir0__: even as a solo queue I was a ranked grinder enjoyer but this last seasons... yikes, I've stopped playing ranked at all
[2:54:23] Sammyrai90: you loose 75 when you are diamond+
[2:54:37] sohollytwitch: I feel like the current system works decently but you need to factor your MMR and the lobby MMR against the LP you gain or lose
[2:55:07] primetimebaee: no
[2:55:09] yesterdaetv: MMR is busted cause the longer the queue time the looser the Matchmaking gets
[2:55:10] papabatt_: 939,109 Masters and Preds* on PC season 17 LUL
[2:55:14] fry_el_wason28: i mean like a month ago i was shitting on people in ranked consistently and then my MMR went up and now i play against 3 stack preds as a solo queue
[2:55:37] twitchpayne: Solo Q Ranked I think could work
[2:55:39] jennanana17: I know it‚Äôs totally different, but in overwatch the top 500 players have really really long queues and their match making seems much more precise
[2:56:18] bigmike1073: as a bot I have been killed by masters and preds in my lobby and it seems way to hard I don‚Äôt do rank at all any more. I don‚Äôt have the 100 hours to grind to a rank especially if I‚Äôm solo
[2:56:24] pepperbeeman: @jennanana17 they had that a few seasons ago and streamers complained and so they started messing with it
[2:56:35] BleachDrinka: i have never gotten higher than plat 4 but i get put in diamond plus lobbies because i can shit on people in my "rank". the mmr is too much for rank
[2:56:36] yesterdaetv: apex tries to speed up the queues to keep people playing the game so it makes the matchmaking super loose
[2:56:39] pepperbeeman: and now the pros complain it's too easy LUL
[2:56:39] fry_el_wason28: i dont think solo queue would work because everybody that gets carried by their friends would be pissed cause theyre constantly getting shit on and then we'd be back to this ranked system
[2:56:41] jennanana17: @pepperbeeman dang, I hate that
[2:57:28] pepperbeeman: Pubs have been brutal for a while. Lots of pubstompers in my lobbies but now they're in ranked playing for placement LUL
[2:57:39] yesterdaetv: i just want season 13 ranked back
[2:57:46] bodegacats: I love it! you two are unstoppable üíï
[2:58:00] sohollytwitch: Something like realm is the only way to solve the top end issues. There's no system that would work for pros and casuals and have everyone happy
[2:58:37] Nohitzki: !unlurk

[2:58:55] twitchpayne: Im stuck in the closet
[2:59:00] pepperbeeman: Conduit so broken. Lifeline + caustic

[3:01:19] pepperbeeman: Respawn won't back off this mmr I bet
[3:01:21] fry_el_wason28: @yesterdaetv sorry 90% of the pros and content creators complained about it, cause in season 12 you could have 6 kills and finish 13th and still go positive and then this made it so ranked wasnt a TDM match
[3:01:22] bigmike1073: I can‚Äôt even loot my poi in ranked before 5-10 teams dead

[3:02:10] Sicilian247: pull!

[3:04:23] ayla_: @bigmike1073 But they won't, they'll just make smurf accounts and do "unranked to diamond" on every legend, and then when people get upset about smurfs they'll go "its just for content". But it sucks getting wrecked every game when you're lower ranked against a smurf from back then
[3:04:41] ayla_: I feel pubs is the quick play
[3:04:44] fry_el_wason28: @yesterdaetv imo it was the best and most balanced rank system. Im even ok with the trials being in ranked. but what needs to be fixed is that they let people zone craft/heal still and just letting people afk the whole match until top 10
[3:04:46] ayla_: ranked is matched and takes longer
[3:04:46] pepperbeeman: Idc about the voices of people with scrims LUL
[3:04:56] Sammyrai90: what about duo ranked and trio ranked
[3:04:56] twitchpayne: Can you get that circle reticle on Console?
[3:05:15] PerceptiveTruth: tbh your level should play a huge role on MMR in ranked too
[3:05:31] theindigoghost: like change it to Casual Rank and Competitive Rank?
[3:05:34] yesterdaetv: @ayla_ facts, they used to do several smurf grinds per season
[3:05:48] fry_el_wason28: they need to just take MMR out of ranked and leave it in pubs
[3:06:00] JLynnn1: i came to hello, and then goodnight im an old person now
[3:06:15] pepperbeeman: I don't like having to try super hard to have a good game
[3:06:16] Nohitzki: @jlynnn1 goodnight young person
[3:06:27] bigmike1073: since they made the rank changes I have not ranked above rookie
[3:06:30] PerceptiveTruth: a level 500 playing against a level 65 is obvious that the level 500 has been in the game a whole heck of a lot longer... why pair them to a level 65...
[3:06:34] ayla_: @pepperbeeman That's why there's pubs, ranked should be sweaty

[3:07:08] blmeek: would you want proximity chat in apex?
[3:07:09] yesterdaetv: @fry_el_wason28 right hidden mmr in rank is weird AF.. like rank is supposed to represent your skill level not some hidden number no one can see
[3:07:10] fry_el_wason28: !duel @Sammyrai90 1500
[3:07:10] StreamElements: @fry_el_wason28, sammyrai90 is already dueling fry_el_wason28
[3:07:18] ayla_: @pepperbeeman Yeah, pubs shouldn't have that, and should be a quick queue. Ranked should be sweaty and have longer matchmaking the higher you get
[3:07:32] Sammyrai90: accept @fry_el_wason28
[3:07:33] JLynnn1: rank should not have mmr, whats the point of the rank part
[3:07:38] blmeek: seems to make Warzone a litle more enjoyable
[3:07:52] JLynnn1: i shouldn't be qing preds in plat
[3:07:53] pepperbeeman: They layered the SBMM on top of ranked
[3:07:53] fry_el_wason28: @yesterdaetv exactly! you leave it in pubs so Faide isnt demolishing Andrews mom in oubs

[3:09:06] PerceptiveTruth: if ranked should be sweaty, than it really does stand to reason that time played and level of the account should play a huge factor in Matching players up.... a level 135 vs a level 315 == good, a level 10 vs level 405... == Why, just why....
