[0:59:20] ivan_thefox: I like to think that you can tell when someone has been in the fast food industry because they almost always have some sort of indicator in the way they talk

[1:12:24] Crypticelsie: I played Smite alot before league

[1:26:24] jake2500: It fits the brief of the stream
[1:26:24] Mikayla_Moon: I feel like I'm on acid or something trippy
[1:26:31] PixZter_: well here for you not the gaem if IÂ´m honest
[1:26:48] SpydrXIII: @Stagrenn yeah that pissed me off and i stopped playing.  uninstalled.  i got a craving for wallriding, reinstalled it and all my old skins and unlocks are still there, so now i'm less mad.
[1:26:49] Crypticelsie: The game lis drug trip/10
[1:26:50] WickedVirgin: Give me the far edges of the Bell curve rather than mediocrity.
[1:27:00] KumoriRyuX: this game is defintely for someone
[1:27:25] Hakaisha89: its not that you dont like tripple a games
[1:27:30] Hakaisha89: its just that most of them are bad

[1:28:06] Hakaisha89: what about that meat game
[1:28:09] Nightjar: So long as you're having fun NODDERS that's what matters
[1:28:16] jake2500: AAA games studios decided fast and furious movies had the right idea.
[1:28:18] ivan_thefox: This game is deep fried in a good way
[1:28:43] Crypticelsie: The only two AAA i've enjoyed recently was like destiny 2 (mostly cause addiction) and hi-fi rush
[1:28:43] SpydrXIII: triple A games are kind of an entry point into gaming.  then you dig into better indie games later as you gain experience.
[1:28:55] PixZter_: Far Cry 5 is kinda good, can go story or just bum around. Fun doing achievments
