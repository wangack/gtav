[4:18:39] rmcgowan: Mary has been the foundation at Mosely's forever. Her even talking about moving somewhere else is definitely earth shaking
[4:18:45] triggerpoint007: I mean why does it matter mp is a w spot honestly you got customers finally
[4:18:59] ViolentAkuma: A better explanation is that you run your own shop and you will supply them with any extra parts you have.
[4:19:21] tedium7: panicc
[4:19:36] Darkri19: people never cared when you were depressed at the shop so why should they care when you move ^

[4:20:11] mugcostanza: kyliebList
[4:20:22] SpectreUK: How about you make a deal if they buy 10 sets bulk deal they get it cheaper
[4:20:34] rmcgowan: $120 per part does shave those margins razor thin
[4:21:21] rmcgowan: It's basically $10k a full order, minus crafting fees
[4:21:23] ibruticus: mhm
[4:21:24] boeiee: and they could price match the 1450 if they dont charge labour fees
[4:21:35] Morningstarter: if you make the parts yourself
[4:21:38] SpectreUK: regular price for single sets better 127 for bulk
[4:21:40] mugcostanza: shdiHmm
[4:21:40] Bi0_: Bulk sell to PD?  xD
[4:21:44] Bi0_: Also  o/
[4:22:14] FIunkifer: 10 sets + for 127 could move a lot of parts that way
[4:22:20] Stoney_Mahoney: and you don't need to pay Acker for making parts, he has lawyer pay LUL
[4:22:29] Matrix8369: honestly the cops would prob buy all your parts
[4:22:33] rmcgowan: To me I feel like there are three price points. There is the price you charge people personally, the price that crafters pay, and then the parts you charge outsiders
[4:22:41] TheFightspit: Idk if the PD still want to have a mechanic to repairs their cars
