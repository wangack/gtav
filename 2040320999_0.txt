[9:28:32] Kawllin: @Bennn4020 First of all that was more of a joke. and yeah I can see how that was taken the wrong way
[9:28:34] Thor_Garden: @Kyle Avoiding giving sworn testimony in court makes it seem like you don't want to get caught lying on the stand
[9:28:34] accidental_isg: lmfao the seamless transition back to the previous convo\
[9:28:35] Ex_ar_Kun: Paula with the receipts!
[9:28:39] BoozeMarlin: exactly

[9:28:45] MrWWonka: ESP When court statements are actually under oath
[9:28:46] Obii97: yea it cant be like that
[9:28:47] Archaius: the only issue i have with the ruling is that they apparently dont think at all about setting bad precedence
[9:28:53] pebblezlio: @kawllin is everything you say a joke then? KEKL
[9:28:54] columbothelieutenant: So if everyone would show up would you agree with the guilty verdict?

[9:29:16] quotingsouthpark: Kyle for judge!
[9:29:17] jaxkmurphy: also crazy how you being stabbed and shot while cuffed in their custody was ignored
[9:29:18] DurrakEM: I mean wouldn't a witness not showing up count as a mistrial IRL?
[9:29:22] akshatkumar89: I m gonna be honest sometimes i love paula but sometimes i m scared of her capabilities!
[9:29:23] Oppositeness: chat, you guys are old people. whats your favorite charcuterie item?
[9:29:25] PhosPhryne: @jaxkmurphy that was INSANE

[9:29:26] flogbishop: you have the right to face your accusers
[9:29:29] Astrodie: nod nod
[9:29:31] Kawllin: @pebblezlio Nope but that was
[9:29:33] p0pnfr3sh: but police don’t need concrete evidence to arrest you. it’s the DA’s job to build a case with the evidence. the problem with this in RP is that u go straight to bench trial
[9:29:34] Ex_ar_Kun: Is that the stolen car over at ammunation still
[9:29:34] Ichi_Korosu: bottom line, is its a 6th amendment right violation technically.   you have a right to face your accusers.  if they dont testify it shouldnt be used.
[9:29:34] belleville23: obviously the judge thought how to grief Kyle today
[9:29:37] exoosia: @Oppositeness cum NODDERS
[9:29:38] 50_tiger: not only that but it sets terrible precedent
[9:29:39] Herman_Miller_1114: @oppositeness good olives. always.
[9:29:41] MarleymanJ: there's a reason you get sworn in
[9:29:42] Drivont: you need the ability to cross examine
[9:29:47] Oppositeness: @exoosia NODDERS
[9:29:48] audriddax: if the witness won't sit, you must acquit

[9:30:05] Oppositeness: @Herman_Miller_1114 do you prefer green or black?

[9:30:13] exoosia: @audriddax If he is thick he must suck dick NODDERS
[9:30:17] Amatthew123: the fact they found you guilty of all charges

[9:30:18] craigforthewin: you also need money
[9:30:20] HorribleHog: This would make for a great platform for a mayoral candidate LUL Glad Pal Gore ain't one
[9:30:21] sterowentUS: feels like onx is squashing the foundations of crime by pressing too hard on petty crime
[9:30:22] Seetherrr: Kyle is one of the only cops that don't push charges that are borderline, almost all others push the borderline charges
[9:30:24] Herman_Miller_1114: @oppositeness green on their own. black on pizza or in things.
[9:30:26] Ichi_Korosu: true,  that kind of stuff would be sorted out in mitigation hearings

[9:31:51] spread___eagle: @contero it's up to the defense to object to the evidence and ask for it to be stricken. If they don't make pre-trial motions it's SoL

[9:32:07] allowingfawn98: Yo
[9:32:08] DoingBusiness: time to murder
[9:32:10] exoosia: Wow. I have seen a lot of takes in my day. But this? This is the worst. If I were a braindead pufferfish I genuinely think I could come up with a better take. If someone put a gun to my head and ordered me to make a worse take, I would tell them to pull the trigger cause I don’t think I can make a worse one. I mean seriously, what were you thinking? Did you really think this was an intelligent take? Really? The only way you could have said this is if you were a troll, are you a troll? pentawBeef

[9:32:56] DromiTM: statements in a report aren't sworn statements simple as that

[9:34:01] exoosia: can you not appeal it with another judge?
[9:34:02] dennithedude: detain
[9:34:07] anteronarus: you really should bring that stuff up. they can form their own opinion but pointing up potential probelms is important for a functioning system
[9:34:14] Oppositeness: I love the law talks when you are on crim and pred NODDERS
[9:34:16] tosfriendlyname: so did the people just decide they didnt want to go to court?
[9:34:19] Paula_Thunder: @gelloz_ i never said it was?
[9:34:20] anteronarus: out*
[9:34:21] p0pnfr3sh: the difference is that in real life u would be arrested and charged and then go to court on a later date. in RP you either go to jail or go to instant bench trial
[9:34:22] Scpoii: you tell him to leave, then if he comes back and does more shit he gets detained and arrested
[9:34:23] Schhwifty: And literally telling them evidence isn't needed because there were witnesses
[9:34:24] vantarts: bring kyleisWiggle back
[9:34:29] Seetherrr: everyone jumps to conclusions in the PD and normally the first person the PD speaks to their perspective = gospel, watch some Soske streams and see it in action PEPW

[9:34:44] A_DeviousHawk: I mean as much as i hate to say it id be good for server health kyleisLUL
[9:34:47] Bulfwyne: pal gore would have called pred a bitch and then would push buttons LUL
[9:34:49] gelloz_: @Paula_Thunder " it always feels like undercover boss when you deal with pd on crim/civ" like what
[9:34:52] D1av0l0: You also would have questioned everyone and used all sides
[9:35:00] Slcko_: Remember Evee doing classes about court for PD
[9:35:01] roguegunslinger1: @p0pnfr3sh  you can do trial later and it removes charges and fines if you found not guilty
[9:35:03] exoosia: PEPW
[9:35:04] Oppositeness: @Kyle its still a pretty damn new server so fleshing out all the laws is gonna take some time.
[9:35:12] Scpoii: you could probably appeal it with a suit for your injuries sustained during custody and win
[9:35:14] Paula_Thunder: @gelloz_ As in hes playing a crim/civ undercover as Pred....
[9:35:16] cartert2212: pal gore is a hero
[9:35:16] mlangcs: someone needs to push a charge for the joints/drugs because 75 joints misdemeanor is crazy
[9:35:16] DromiTM: the verdict was bullshit because the statements affected the result and the people that made the statements couldn't be questioned
[9:35:26] Oppositeness: @Kyle everyone is enjoying themselves which is what matters Shrug

[9:35:36] zeka_zun: @gelloz_ idk if its worth arguing with him, seems he is just drama baiting
[9:35:39] BoozeMarlin: @dromitm yep
