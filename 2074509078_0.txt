[2:12:30] xXxEV0xXx: They are asking a guy to explain himself and defend himself, then get mad at defending and explaining himself. lol
[2:12:31] sophering: he ended up taking accountability

[2:12:47] TimmayHS: He showed accountability, just not for the silly shit
[2:12:48] hereforff9: There was no way this was gonna go any different dawg :/
[2:12:48] FinexLive: was great rp
[2:12:50] Ikilledkenny91: @ssaab gonna watch the vid of the names given?
[2:12:50] sophering: it was 2 months ago dude
[2:12:52] Kizzlefoshizzle: Just need to keep him on a tight leash as Malton said LUL
[2:12:52] Istaf_SC: Saab obviously wants him but I don't think anyone else does
[2:12:53] brittandavis: Whose the blacked lady?
[2:12:54] FuZroK: yeah, he didnt attack 4uth this time at least
[2:12:56] strawberryraye: when does Den get his panel?
[2:12:58] chupathingy77: I am still waiting for Slacks to suspend himself for the 12 names.
[2:13:01] daru_89: The answer to the question of how he will improve  was "everybody likes Cornwood" :D
[2:13:04] FinexLive: I expected more jokes from CORNMAN
[2:13:06] MsFreya_x: @strawberryraye already has
[2:13:07] slendom: @brittandavis pardon
[2:13:08] TimmayHS: The sheriff thing and the Lyin Knight thing
[2:13:11] Alekdk1: @brittandavis the what lady?
[2:13:11] applejakxx: i don't think its "undermining the chain of command" to listen to complaints and bring them to captains instead of telling people "talk to the captains"
[2:13:12] djhyzel78: he took accountability
[2:13:19] Mic_Stargazer: ngl i didnt thinkt he 12 names were real til they sent the clip lol
[2:13:20] talamah: Chatting
[2:13:23] AmyanaKC: Think about how hard it would be to stand there, by yourself with 4-5 people standing around you, demanding that you explain your behavior like that!
[2:13:25] Riotsmurf2: The downside to this fire, is that it only goes through the negatives the officer has. In a professional environment the positives should be talked about too. There are reasonable spaces between his daps where he does great.
[2:13:26] spookyghost21: Alice being unbiased and out of the loop completely is probably for the best
[2:13:26] talamah: wideduckass
[2:13:27] sophering: no way corndog wouldve shown zero accountability
[2:13:27] mercs99: @strawberryraye he already did, was only Slacks that showed and was fired
[2:13:30] ezrem2: 12 names actually real
[2:13:31] ezrem2: lol
[2:13:32] Orblitzer: why is there not a senior from each shift there? this meeting seems very shift 1 sided…
[2:13:35] VenatusVox: No writing a report when Cletus gave 12 names to Slacks = 12 DAPS for slacks
[2:13:39] brittandavis: oh fuck i meant the black haired lady jfc
[2:13:40] MyDoSe_: I was surprised the 12 names was real KEKW

[2:13:43] sophering: why was alice here then?
[2:13:43] DrunkenGrump: How long is a mayors term in this game chat?
[2:13:47] AmyanaKC: It's not a review... they only looked at the negatives
[2:13:49] FetchLong: @applejakxx that is exactly it. People should not talk about things they are not happy with with anyone else but Captains.
[2:13:49] strawberryraye: @mercs99 he was fired? :(
[2:13:50] chupathingy77: one DAP per missed name?
[2:13:52] daru_89: Esfand really plays it amazingly
[2:13:53] Alkemiee: captains shouldn't bring senior officers in last minute like this....they will just go along with what the captains want anyway

[2:14:44] Alekdk1: You did say that you would suspend yourself for 24 hours if it was true @ssaab
[2:14:44] Drkdream: 3 weeks EZ
[2:14:45] TJFOOL: why get defensive, just take accountability! trollface
[2:14:45] Phage_Cleaver: Never take accountability. That's the problem. Captains never take accountability
[2:14:46] FizzDidThis: wideduckass
[2:14:46] cjohno20: the point is that bring issues to Chani of Command is pointless. that's the point
[2:14:46] VenatusVox: YOU promoted CLetus the same meeting! 12 DAPS
[2:14:47] Scrando: saabDap2
[2:14:47] RonJon: shouldn't have said it
[2:14:48] EPiQ: I don't think its the sole reason, but it applies to the COC convos. He doesn't ignore COC so much as compiling info from people who don't feel comfortable to talk to a captain or senior.
[2:14:48] TheTourist_: can't believe slacks would crucify cletus, leader of the 12 apostles FeelsBadMan
[2:14:50] AmyanaKC: It's messed up to look at past daps, but refuse to talk about any positives  .. do you even have a way if tracking it when an officer does something super positive?
[2:14:52] deezznutsxd: you said you would dab yourself sessh
[2:14:52] xl_scout_lx: because he took it up the chain and the chain didn’t do anything
[2:14:53] Wynter282: you grilled him over stuff that happened 60 days ago....
[2:14:54] CuBanMumzy: listen here fella listen to your captains

[2:14:55] brentvargas: just like half these things hes getting shit for
[2:14:55] Clivent: @Ssaab, did 4uth tell she went off duty to follow cornwood and den generally curious
[2:14:55] Hibob222: he is gaslighting
[2:14:57] BurgGolf: suspension though….?
[2:14:57] Count_Brennuvarg: Weirdge you said you'd dap yourself, get to it buddy PepeLaugh @Ssaab
[2:14:57] mercs99: well it competes with the narrative that he went out of chain of command and has never given names, which is something ive heard cornwood accused of repeatedly
[2:14:57] Cultivated: Deflecting bro
[2:14:57] Skypoopa: do you remember saying you would dap yourself tho @Ssaab
[2:14:58] d00b3rr: but Johnson didnt remember...
[2:14:58] ArdentCause: Mr character please I want to hear what everyone has to say
[2:14:58] Shakestar: If Slacks forgot the 12 names, Aldo could have forgotten his situation instead of getting so defensive
[2:14:59] nasarat_blast: You just pressed cornwood on a list of shit that happened 60 days ago lol
[2:14:59] sonadapop: and this is why the PD needs oversight
[2:14:59] Mic_Stargazer: theres just a difference between "i dont remember" and" it didn thappen" is all lol

[3:37:37] lucidifous: @Dark_Matter_Zeo yeah thats where I'm at with it. Excessive force or desecration of a corpse both make sense. But the shooting was justified

[3:39:01] wellbigsmoke: KEKW
[3:39:02] ArdentCause: @Ssaab I think ruby had a good idea, getting the people who understand motorcycles and actually know how to use them - come together get a guideline set up and set up a training and you can have a senior/captain take the course first to see if its valid and then present it for CERT
[3:39:02] Artsii1994: make duncan the commioner Duncaning

[4:27:00] JennyHell: @SmugPls but they can wash away if they arent too big of a buildup
[4:27:02] chaosproductions: Is there any scenario for a Cop to play into SBS on duty in this server?
[4:27:03] Ikilledkenny91: Chat didn't slacks say he would suspend himself if the 12 names was true? Waiting
[4:27:15] SilentStormAU: @SmugPls i do its like tattos for roads WICKED
[4:27:17] Laticore: chat you don’t get fired if you get 10 daps
[4:27:18] zenyatta: So basically all shes learned from this convo is that as soon as she finds the courage to speak up about something thats bothering her, she happens to get a dap, even if its a valid one lol
[4:27:20] ExoticMeats: Safe space for feedback is go through proper CoC
[4:27:24] zenyatta: this is rough ngl

[4:28:49] MsFreya_x: @Rare__Potato I clicked it thinking it was drama and was disappointed
[4:28:53] BigglesVII: Is it a premature Dap. If the lawyer confirms extortion she would be getting indefinate suspension until the docket is done and could be subject to further disiplinary action if found guilty?
[4:28:57] McMillvn: @Mouso9  MegaLUL
[4:28:58] RoninSisu: I get it. I feel like corrective training would be better than a DAP
[4:28:59] zenyatta: i mean would it have killed slacks to wait a little while after this serious convo to drop the news lmao

[4:29:07] Mouso9: Also saab. Apologies for chat including myself.

[4:29:19] ExoticMeats: @mouso9 you can't hold everyone's hand
[4:29:20] MsFreya_x: @mad0monk She really isn't need to watch from more than one POV
[4:29:24] chaosproductions: DAPs are very lazy RP... i think creative punishments are better for learning and better for Morale...
[4:29:27] DonnBeach: @RoninSisu Yeah it goes to the DAP system too much
[4:29:28] warkid123: "your lawyer is shit, you will not get a deal with a lawyer that is doing fuckery" = "change your lawyer dude" and the timing sucks big time
[4:29:35] jersey_jesus: Damn that would be a good tactic to get Ramee out of cell reps OMEGALAUGHING
[4:29:42] mad0monk: @MsFreya_x I watch from more then one plenty, and she for sure is

[6:06:08] TraviiiOnTwitch: i dont see how he could prove beyond a reasonable doubt that none of the other officers magdumping him killed him, but itll be fun rp

[6:06:57] BBCapitalist: gets hot 5 times but cornwood gets a murder charge?
[6:06:59] GodzFire3: But where was the last shot located? He could have done that last shot in non-lethal location, like a leg. That's incredibly important.
[6:07:00] DonnieRockettt: Kappa
[6:07:07] TimmayHS: Hall is conflicted and retained by Cornwood.. so he can't do shit

[6:07:32] spookyghost21: i could of sworn Dean said "Dead before hitting the ground" but would still be desecrating body felony tho
[6:07:35] Honorspren: no way they where still alive when cornwood added the last one
[6:07:36] hiicks_: How can he prove that Cornwood's extra shots are what caused the death?
[6:07:36] TheOGWombat: this kills his bar too
[6:07:39] Evilzanz: look at our boy so conflicted
[6:07:41] williamwildcat: but is it in-rp that if you magdump a character after theyre down theyre forced to perma? feel like we're playing in a gray RP space
[6:07:41] Lucsvm: one for baas, two for baas, three for baas
[6:07:46] DonnBeach: @hiicks_ Exactly

[6:08:02] TheOGWombat: @williamwildcat nobody is ever forced to die
[6:08:03] Custard02: could be good if he writes up a paragraph to hand to other captains
[6:08:18] BBCapitalist: he gets shot 25 times but cornwood gets a murder charge for the sam bass shot?
[6:08:22] longhorns2565: LMAO @squonk513 You spot on though
[6:08:25] williamwildcat: @TheOGWombat  ye but the implication is tha bullets after being down = death. which i kinda get in-RP because extra bullets bad but so is 5 cops shooting 1 person
[6:08:40] GodzFire3: Only the head there is a lethal shot, every place else is non-lethal.
[6:08:43] williamwildcat: not saying one way or another ,just feels weird to play in this space
[6:08:46] TheOGWombat: thats not how it works though
[6:08:57] EPiQ: dean just needs to wake Don Bush 23rd wake up from being buried alive
[6:09:14] nochooch: cause of death shot in the head, might be hard to argue who's bullet did that?
[6:09:15] TimmayHS: Donald Bush the 22nd is already dead and Donald Bush the 21st is coming to town on Sunday LUL
[6:09:16] ixidakonixi: Quick call norman bones
[6:09:17] 98noir: i guess his main defense could be that theres no way to confirm if the extra bullets killed him or he was dead when all officers fired? theres still gonna be a charge tho
[6:09:18] squonk513: are y'all going to refund cornwood for the upgrades at least?
[6:09:18] Evilzanz: @EPiQ esfandHowdy
[6:09:26] TheOGWombat: @epiq that would be funny. he comes back as a zombie
[6:09:28] crazygerman03: intresting to see where the rp goes but they still need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that that last shot by cornwood is what killed him and not any of the others that other officers shot
[6:09:32] ShaneyRL: Cornwoods were bodys shots ya?
[6:09:34] trends0: The last bullet wasnt to the head
[6:09:37] BBCapitalist: its gonna be interesting rp for sure but the pd becomes the city villain instantly lol
[6:09:39] trends0: he said he shot the chest last
[6:09:45] TimmayHS: Donald Bush is taking out the whole PD one officer at a time. Cornwood, Aziz, who's next?
[6:09:45] williamwildcat: autoposy is how many gunshot wounds? 5?
[6:09:51] DonnBeach: So did not kill him
[6:09:51] longhorns2565: That may save himl
[6:09:52] crescenterra: saved? LUL
[6:09:59] longhorns2565: if the cause of death is bullet to the head
[6:10:02] Honorspren: chest, but cause of death was to the head
[6:10:03] EPiQ: technically nobody knows if the 5 bullets that hit were cornwood at all.
[6:10:04] ShaneyRL: Prayge
[6:10:07] RonJon: so then he for sure isn't the one that killed him?
[6:10:07] Evilzanz: can they trace all the bullets to guns?
[6:10:12] longhorns2565: then the bullet to chest would be desecration not murder
[6:10:24] squonk513: if this was actual Police RP. He would get 1 month paid vacation.
[6:10:27] williamwildcat: @longhorns2565 tru
[6:10:33] steven__99: @longhorns2565 still a felony
[6:10:33] DonnBeach: I mean on the desecrating part like how does that work does there have to be intent?
[6:10:33] TheOGWombat: imagine if the report says he missed every single shot
[6:10:38] lora1969: 4 saabBaas 7
[6:10:53] GodzFire3: But was the guy still alive?

[6:11:05] hiicks_: If he can't prove which bullets killed him then I don't think he should push it, that's reasonable doubt already
[6:11:11] williamwildcat: this is tough.
[6:11:12] longhorns2565: @steven__99 yeah but easier to expunge
[6:11:12] trends0: if he wasnt dead (died at hospital), then the final bullet wouldnt be desecration
[6:11:16] steven__99: @longhorns2565 that doesnt matter its still a felony
[6:11:17] Honorspren: dude basically got firing squaded
[6:11:18] StreamElements: Don't forget to follow the stream if you are enjoying yourself!
[6:11:19] EPiQ: 7 officers mag dump, no way to prove who hit just like firing squads lol
[6:11:28] DonnBeach: @trends0 there is that too
[6:11:30] lora1969: malton RAGEY
[6:11:31] GodzFire3: I can't remember watching the stream if the guy was still talking trash when the final shot happened.
[6:11:31] longhorns2565: think murder is like the 9s
[6:11:31] occams_cha1nsaw: so how did the panel go
[6:11:32] ixidakonixi: The double tap is reason enough unfortunately
[6:11:38] Shakestar: 7 officers mag dumped and only 5 shots landed lol
[6:11:45] TimmayHS: at most it's desecration of a body
[6:11:46] bahubaker: @EPiQ yeah but his statement
[6:11:46] DonnBeach: Like desecrating seems like a charge you could easily get as an officer by accident
[6:11:53] longhorns2565: @steven__99 Descration can be expunged i think murder is the 9s
[6:12:00] Kizzlefoshizzle: Looks like Esfand is going back to WoW soon PepeLaugh
[6:12:02] RonJon: @TimmayHS they said he wasn't pronounced dead until the hospital so it wouldn't be a body
[6:12:07] knowlightnofear: Cornwood wasn't the only one shooting correct? who's to say one of the other officers had the killing blow
[6:12:07] Shaphilly_: i feel like the one lifer thing is cheesy in regards to the outcomes it cause with main characters. just my opinion though
[6:12:09] williamwildcat: ofc the one thing that could save him (5 bullet holes) is the thing he said in his statement (25 bullets in5 holes) lmao
[6:12:13] WildWillie419: monkaS
[6:12:14] Honorspren: COD: shot to head, cornwwood shot him in the chest. case closed
[6:12:16] TimmayHS: @bahubaker according to the captains, his own reports aren't very good
[6:12:23] hiicks_: Can't be desecration if he died at the hospital
[6:12:24] DonnieRockettt: @Kizzlefoshizzle nah, Cornwood vs Sephiroth time
[6:12:26] Cppi40: If the report says there were only 5 gunshot wounds Cornwood just has to say all his 25 shots missed
[6:12:36] longhorns2565: @hiicks_ Holy crap
[6:12:40] bahubaker: @TimmayHS yeah im saying his statement on the report incriminates him of murder
[6:12:44] TimmayHS: @RonJon well sure, but that's a game mechanic
[6:12:48] GodzFire3: The problem is by game mechanics the scene was scuffed, it should have been like 50 rounds in him, and there's also desync. So what one person saw someone else didn't.
[6:12:52] Shakestar: Given it's Cornwood, he could have missed every shot
[6:12:53] williamwildcat: @Cppi40 uhnfortunately corndogs statement was 25 bullets in 5 holes. lol
[6:12:56] DonnBeach: He already reported he thought all hit
[6:13:08] EPiQ: @bahubaker I’m sure a lot of officers would also testify they shot him, but evidence says otherwise. That’d be my defense.
[6:13:18] condor2104: Dana
[6:13:25] RonJon: @TimmayHS No? in RP he was taken to the hospital and operated on and pronounced dead there.
[6:13:35] steven__99: @epiq and he would still get desecration of a corpse which is a felony
[6:13:35] lolJukebox: Who
[6:13:40] lolJukebox: the blackwell one?
[6:13:42] ThoughtExperimnt: ThoughtExperimnt subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! So is the goal to stop the "Police Academy/Super Troopers" vibe in the PD to end. I mean taking SBS seriously etc.
[6:13:43] lolJukebox: 2811
[6:13:50] longhorns2565: if the cause of death is bullet to the head then the bullet to chest would be desecration not murder and if he didnt die until the hospital then its harder for it to be desecration @Ssaab
[6:13:51] MrBASins: the backlash it going to take pd under I think as they are going to lose a lot of police will quit
[6:13:55] GodzFire3: For Cornwood to be fired is one thing, but for him to be charged for murder and stuff, that's.....yea. Not cool.
[6:13:55] TimmayHS: @RonJon that's how perma works right?
[6:14:02] Saxon217: @TimmayHS isnt also a game mechanic that everyone know it was a 1 life character and intentionally NVLing?
[6:14:07] trends0: @longhorns2565 This
[6:14:08] Honorspren: its a bit of a stretch....
[6:14:16] condor2104: the PD looks bad already lol./
[6:14:17] TimmayHS: In a few months, SBS like this will be fully acceptable and common
[6:14:18] Moobot: Thanks for subbing, fatbuck! Welcome to the Saabscribers! saabH
[6:14:19] BCMcGraw: it will look bad either way
[6:14:19] RonJon: @TimmayHS That's how people who get shot and succumb to their wounds in real life also work.
[6:14:20] ZobeyZobes: PD looks bad no matter what Kappa
[6:14:23] Honorspren: thern charge all 7 officers with murder, dude was dead when cletus shot him
[6:14:23] DonnBeach: Would anyone even know if it was covered up? Its a one lifer that no one cares about
[6:14:28] aaronalford24: is it a report?
[6:14:31] steven__99: @saxon217 that generally just has to do with how long they are in prison for
[6:14:33] trends0: @longhorns2565 This is the out here @Ssaab
[6:14:34] TheOGWombat: what if it was a brick?
[6:14:39] vellooci: PERMA IS A CHOICE
[6:14:39] TimmayHS: If that were the case, it wouldn't have happened..
[6:14:44] 04jetta: @lolJukebox IIRC this is correct
[6:14:46] Ikilledkenny91: He wouldn't of done it
[6:14:50] ITZxJeff: @TheOGWombat LMAOOOOO
[6:14:50] steven__99: @trends0 its not an out, its still a felony
[6:14:52] TimmayHS: he does it every week
[6:14:52] arcticOP: so there is context to to him doing it?
[6:14:53] knowlightnofear: But esfand wouldn't have done it
[6:14:55] williamwildcat: so is this ooc punishment for dean
[6:14:56] DonnBeach: Personally I enjoy corruption in police stories so no I would not
[6:14:56] BfAleTitan: reading the room is why Cornwood did what he did
[6:14:57] condor2104: You need to unite the PD and teach not punish\
[6:14:58] lora1969: do it saabStare come to the darkside young Padawan
[6:14:58] doc_jade: he wouldnt have done it if it was an actual RPer
[6:14:59] jessielight: could you imagine spending most of your time punishing the officers and not teaching them. daps dont teach them
[6:14:59] spicyville: he wasn’t pronounced dead until he went to the hospital so you can’t say desecration and you can’t prove his bullet killed him so seems like there’s some doubt
[6:14:59] RonJon: what if it was an ant instead of a human? what if it happened on mars? what if some random thing that iddn't happen happeend? @Ssaab
[6:15:00] trends0: @steven__99 What is?
[6:15:01] Ikilledkenny91: Esfand knew it was a 1 lifer
[6:15:07] Wynter282: he knew it was a 1 lifer
[6:15:07] Satic: Dean did it to grief PD so it doesn't count Kappa
[6:15:07] Evilzanz: you have no clue how corrupt pd is LUL
[6:15:08] hiicks_: It wasn't though, it's a one life character, you got 2nd degree for killing them in 3.0
[6:15:08] Lucsvm: @Ssaab I think if he dindt perma and sue the pd/cornwood will be wrost
[6:15:09] RonJon: what if it was an ant instead of a human? what if it happened on mars? what if some random thing that didn't happen happeend? @Ssaab
[6:15:10] TimmayHS: I mean, in a fantasy world.. sure
[6:15:12] luckerooni: Whole pd would be dead lol
[6:15:12] steven__99: @trends0 desecration is still a felony
[6:15:16] Chaoszero_goc: the whole town already knows about it and no one cares
[6:15:16] DonnieRockettt: it was a perma for content more or less
[6:15:19] Ikilledkenny91: Ban 1 lifers imo
[6:15:20] cary7: wideduckass hey saab look at this
[6:15:24] GodzFire3: But Esfand knew Dean's character was a 1 lifer. Dean was RPing that he wanted to die by police hand. Ehh
[6:15:27] monkz89: charge Cornwood ReallyMad
[6:15:30] Saxon217: @luckerooni lol this
[6:15:33] williamwildcat: to be fair, cops go OOC when someoens headpops. why is 1 lifers that different. little grey area
[6:15:34] trends0: @steven__99 Desecration requires the act to be committed on a dead body. He died in the hospital, not prior to the shot.
[6:15:40] JorganLive: I'm just sad because I am mourning Esfand quitting RP after this. I'm gonna have to watch WoW. I don't wanna watch WoW. Sadge
[6:15:42] longhorns2565: @steven__99 if the cause of death is bullet to the head then the bullet to chest would be desecration not murder
[6:15:42] lora1969: we need a 1 lifer stream
[6:15:42] Lucsvm: @Ssaab  if he dindt perma and sue the pd/cornwood will be wrost
[6:15:45] RonJon: Yeah if it wasn't a 1 lifer people would care and if it happened on Jupiter they would suffocate
[6:15:45] PolygonStatic: sbs is fine but you should expect to take the serious consequences along with it depending on context
[6:15:48] ITZxJeff: oh
[6:15:48] SilentStormAU: i think if esfand didn't know it was deans perma character he wouldnt have shot the last few bullets into him Shrug
[6:15:57] GodzFire3: I feel like if Deansocool knew this would have been happened he never would have allowed it.
[6:16:05] Wynter282: i guarantee literally nobody cares really that he did that
[6:16:12] MexiBrent: knowing its a one lifer is worst, you know the character is going to die, dont shoot it extra times
[6:16:13] Saxon217: @GodzFire3 exactly
[6:16:15] BigglesVII: Is Murder a capital punishment
[6:16:16] longhorns2565: @steven__99 if the cause of death is bullet to the head then the bullet to chest would be desecration not murder and if he didnt die until the hospital then its harder for it to be desecration
[6:16:17] Honorspren: dude was dead when he shot theough
[6:16:18] brushun: Cleetus fall from grace
[6:16:19] luckerooni: I think the specifics of this case don't allow for the charges on technicality but that's for the lawyer guy to determine
[6:16:19] MrBASins: If it was a problem in the first place then you should have done it sooner not later
[6:16:22] sp0rkehNW: BatChesting do this
[6:16:22] brushun: into a murder trial
[6:16:22] autorocket: that does kind of ruin cletus as a character ngl
[6:16:24] brushun: lmao
[6:16:24] arcticOP: @GodzFire3 i mean he did it literally yesterday at senior buns
[6:16:24] Evilzanz: so he fired
[6:16:28] jessielight: so they are charging all the offiers that fired their weapon then right?
[6:16:29] DonnBeach: Everyone expected that character to die
[6:16:31] condor2104: True, but you dividing the PD by your actions, u need to see that]
[6:16:33] MrBASins: that oin you
[6:16:33] DonnBeach: Dean wants him to die
[6:16:35] BfAleTitan: by this logic you could have 1 person get accepted to WL, then make 1 life characters until all cops get fired lol
[6:16:38] DonnieRockettt: pd 1 lifer Kappa
[6:16:38] RonJon: No but it does mean that it's lame
[6:16:38] Chaoszero_goc: who wants him to get charged?
[6:16:40] CuBanMumzy: some people want the PD serious when its not their streamer
[6:16:40] bahubaker: HELL YEAH ITS GOOD RP
[6:16:41] lolJukebox: i mean you gotta say cornwood as created so much rp around all this
[6:16:42] EPiQ: it feels like smart improv where they both inherently accepted the situation and content.
[6:16:44] Satic: IC everyone has one life, can't let OOC knowledge affect the scenario
[6:16:48] jessielight: excuses for power abuses
[6:16:48] PolygonStatic: NODDERS the rp doesnt end here
[6:16:49] neowizerd: Cornwood Mall Cop incoming
[6:16:51] Moobot: Thanks for subbing, Emilio_Ez1! Welcome to the Saabscribers! saabH
[6:16:51] sp0rkehNW: people cant just let the RP flow....
[6:16:52] bahubaker: R U NOT ENTERTAINED CHATTERS?
[6:16:52] Emilio_Ez1: Emilio_Ez1 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[6:16:54] ShinJiHun: @BfAleTitan don't do dapworthy stuff - it really isn't that hard OMEGALUL
[6:16:56] shirosari: Cletus would make a great warden
[6:16:56] jollypnda: @honorspren lol that’s the problem he isn’t in trouble for shooting the guy, he is in trouble for shooting after being downed
[6:16:56] Wynter282: and what if hes got a felony and cant do literally anything he likes any more?
[6:16:57] brushun: Nah it's great RP
[6:16:57] ThoughtExperimnt: It was legit curiosity on my part
[6:16:59] TheTourist_: ABOZO
[6:16:59] monkz89: ignore chat, let the RP flow
[6:17:00] luckerooni: Chatters love dooming
[6:17:01] GodzFire3: The problem is if cornwood is found guilty he gets a felony on his record.
[6:17:02] williamwildcat: i dont think its an L, its just all weird roleplay. hours spent on the grey area of 1 lifers. :/
[6:17:03] neowizerd: Snr Buns security guard
[6:17:06] JennyHell: saabWiggle
[6:17:06] ixidakonixi: Could get pardoned too it's not the end of cletus
[6:17:08] EPiQ: tbf, he can lose this and still get his own dept, independent of lspd
[6:17:09] figmariee: or esfand comes back with a new officer
[6:17:15] Eddie1225: what grey area dont double tap people
[6:17:18] Eddie1225: its not that hard
[6:17:19] Eddie1225: OMEGALAUGHING
[6:17:23] DonnBeach: And in all honesty this is only happening because Captain Brooke pushed so hard
[6:17:24] Clodhoppr: I think it would be hilarious for Dean to create Don Bush the 24th to go to court and claim that his “brother” the 23rd was a psycho that plotted mass murder or some shit LUL
[6:17:25] ShinJiHun: @Eddie1225 ^^^^^^^^
[6:17:26] StreamElements: What they said saabThat
[6:17:26] jersey_jesus: GW Bush will bury Cornwood for assassinating his family members UltraMad
[6:17:27] Satic: Eddie OMEGALUL
[6:17:28] williamwildcat: then arrest every crim when headpops
[6:17:29] Eddie1225: deans one lifer wanted to die yesterday he got shot
[6:17:30] longhorns2565: I just want saabs opinion now on my thoughts now
[6:17:31] DanLGG: The fact that people are talking in game about it and chat is obviously talking about it. it’s creating RP which is what we are here for.
[6:17:33] monkz89: literally @eddie1225
[6:17:33] Eddie1225: no one double tapped him
[6:17:36] lora1969: Eddie1225 based
[6:17:40] Eddie1225: lmao
[6:17:42] condor2104: maybe Cornwood's brother joins the PD, maybe Jeb Cornwood, lol
[6:17:44] BfAleTitan: @ShinJiHun Daps have nothing to do with what i said
[6:17:44] millzeebb: They're coming for the you but I'm standing in the way ARC
[6:17:45] djanik31: The funny thing is if he didnt get the 1 dap for Brian Knight situation, you wouldnt have tried to charge him with a felony at all right now
[6:17:47] ShinJiHun: How could tne life characterforce me to do dapworth stuff???? NotLikeThis
[6:17:52] windstaff54: @Eddie1225 yeah but the should have ReallyMad

[6:18:11] DonnieRockettt: pd gonna get affected by cornwood being gone ngl
[6:18:12] jessielight: yeah you have to have the evil enemies and 2 of captains are fulfilling that role to the T
[6:18:14] Eddie1225: the eddie hates cornwood crowd is going to go crazy tonight OMEGALAUGHING
[6:18:19] Chronatog13: If cornwood gets charged wouldn't you have to charge all the officers who shot? @ssaab
[6:18:25] Eddie1225: no
[6:18:25] ShinJiHun: @BfAleTitan keep making one-life characters to get all the cops fired.... how?
[6:18:27] Sanitet: @Eddie1225 UltraMad but it made aziz shoot a civ
[6:18:28] Eddie1225: cuz they didnt double tap him
[6:18:33] Eddie1225: its only an issue cuz of the double tap
[6:18:40] Eddie1225: idk how people dont see thaty
[6:18:43] Eddie1225: that *
[6:18:44] DonnBeach: I just mean it going this far
[6:18:44] Eddie1225: OMEGALAUGHING
[6:18:45] windstaff54: im willing to say it, i dont hate eddie peepoHappy
[6:18:46] Chaoszero_goc: but if slacks doesnt want to charge him who does?
[6:18:47] jy33130: LUL
[6:18:48] bahubaker: FOR SURE
[6:18:48] Rare__Potato: PD gonna get better with Cornwood gone ong frfr
[6:18:49] FSouza_01: I want the worse PepeLaugh
[6:18:49] kittytaiyo: Idk... I have a feeling with his relations to the mayor there will be a pardon and his Sheriff's office will still come about. Hopefully no bad blood between the too...
[6:18:50] luckerooni: 100%
[6:18:50] condor2104: YEAH
[6:18:52] Chaoszero_goc: arent you the boss?
[6:18:52] lolJukebox: even if he does get arrested it there will be so much roleplay
[6:18:55] Skypoopa: cornwood did the wrong thing so he should be fired
[6:18:55] longhorns2565: Saab, whats your thought on this?   if the cause of death is bullet to the head then the bullet to chest would be desecration not murder and if he didnt die until the hospital then its harder for it to be desecration
[6:18:57] CuBanMumzy: yup 100%
[6:18:59] condor2104: All Hell will break loose
[6:19:01] Eddie1225: SCHIZO max OMEGALAUGHING
[6:19:07] ShinJiHun: @Eddie1225 because they just repeat what the doomers say LUL
[6:19:09] Wynter282: lmao is the R word banned i love it
[6:19:10] Emilio_Ez1: there will be a civil war against the pd thats for sure
[6:19:11] vellooci: If it makes you feel any better esfand wholeheartedly defending you rn
[6:19:11] figmariee: I want THAT rp lol
[6:19:13] jollypnda: all this shows me is, chatters want multi day jail sentences for crims doing crime but nothing when an officer commits one.
[6:19:15] Eddie1225: @Chaoszero_goc no there are 3 captains
[6:19:15] DonnieRockettt: kinda want to see what happens but I understand your point
[6:19:17] jessielight: lets forget all the good hes does lets overlook that  because wow all we can focus on is the bad. thats the majority of the captains rp right now
[6:19:22] McMillvn: Cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head so Cornwood didn't land the killing blow and Donald Bush died in the hosptial so it couldn't be desecration at that point?
[6:19:23] DanLGG: They aren’t going to arrest Cornwood. they post it to the docket and it’s a trial
[6:19:27] brushun: Are there Jury trials? Cletus could probably win that lol
[6:19:31] condor2104: its fun RP have to admit
[6:19:39] Chaoszero_goc: @Eddie1225 right so 2 out of 3 would have to agree to press charges?
[6:19:43] Eddie1225: @brushun no they stopped those in 2.0
[6:19:48] Eddie1225: cuz everyone would just bribe them
[6:19:48] DCSeth: do those sanitation trucks always have the parts people want in them? or is that like a chance thing?
[6:19:53] EPiQ: not a cornwood defense, but if near 100 rounds are fired, and only 5 hit…everyone present needs firearms training.
[6:19:56] millzeebb: Cornwoods witch hunt arc
[6:20:00] ikarosnymph: If cornwood gets fired it would be funny if he sues for all his turbos back
[6:20:08] DCSeth: or however that works?
[6:20:12] DiscretionaI: Fact - The meta war has to end for the sake of future RP @ssaab
[6:20:12] crescenterra: @ikarosnymph he already took them out of the cars
[6:20:19] ikarosnymph: oh
[6:20:22] ShinJiHun: @TimmayHS WH OMEGALUL asked?
[6:20:22] Eddie1225: please dont bring OOC into this
[6:20:23] jessielight: Cornwood will remain trying to build people up while the captains will continue to tear cops down. thats the rp

[6:21:06] M3disyn: actions have consequences KEKW this isnt gtaonline
[6:21:08] Rare__Potato: Cornwood definitely doesn't try to tear people down like anyone that goes against him OMEGALAUGHING
[6:21:09] Honorspren: still hard to call it murder imo
[6:21:10] Satic: Yes I saw it happen, fire Slacks
[6:21:11] TimmayHS: Cornwood follows COPs
[6:21:12] DonnBeach: All of this has taught me people just have different perspectives on how the rp should work and how things should be handled. Is what it is.
[6:21:13] lora1969: @GodzFire3 COPIUM

[6:28:37] humanhere2: That's a large part of it... PD just isn't meeting the demands of the "tsunami" of crimes that the city is producing.  So civs feel that, and that'll shift them against PD, towards the crims.

[6:49:53] KCoutdoors: he twitched
[6:49:54] GodzFire3: The guy already attacked and seriously stabbed Andrews. He had a death wish. It wasn't just Cornwood was downing an innocent bystander

[6:54:12] Chaoszero_goc: does shoot to kill matter?
[6:54:13] Thedredgingjudge: Yeah way true
[6:54:15] CurlyGumbo: @jollypnda yeqh and they get out the same night and do it over and over again. forinc this serious rp on a silly pd char means he can't rp his char anymore. it's like a dnd campaign where the players want a silly campaign and the dm wants his gritty dark fantasy world. either tell the players: no sillyness or the dm adapts to the players
[6:54:25] monkz89: @timmayhs yep

[6:55:50] jukla12: @Scrando bro that court case would be insane KEKW
[6:55:54] TimmayHS: I guess also this could be considered union busting in a way?
[6:56:06] jessielight: they are not seeing the ramifications and where this will go with their officers
[6:56:11] jollypnda: @curlygumbo lol you may be new to rp im not sure , but chatter went 20 million into debt for contempt of court over sbs. Also the people that fought in the sanguine thing got 30 days in jail so you have to pick and choose your battles
[6:56:14] lora1969: eggs saabStare

[6:56:18] squonk513: can we investigate how Eddie isnt banned?
[6:56:19] dains84: The Tony Andrews angle will get a really good look at for the mental state of what Cornwood did and play a huge part of the verdict
[6:56:21] DonnBeach: I don't even think that's the case
[6:56:23] Hibob222: when  ssaab said hoppers mad it reminded me of the hoes mad mr k song he plays :P

[6:56:41] Chaoszero_goc: wait did you see a moonmoon clip for that?
[6:56:43] Thedredgingjudge: it could be a possibility
[6:56:44] crazygerman03: tbf no matter how this turns out I think Cornwood gets the BCSO or equivilent
[6:56:44] bcbray: not only wrote the script but memorized it is there anything this man can't do
[6:56:45] SojuBorealist: The cope hoppers are hilarious tho
[6:56:47] ShinJiHun: It's been crazy in 4.0 to see the "So and so brings content = pls no consequences" change from coming from crim hoppers to PD hoppers

[6:56:52] DCSeth: @Eddie1225 they have higher standards, thats why the second mag is a premium UltraMad
[6:56:52] DanLGG: I think he would beat the charge in court
[6:56:58] squonk513: the autopsy literally says died from bullet to the head

[6:57:03] Eddie1225: OMEGALAUGHING
[6:57:03] MoonLiit: Can someone explain to me how cornwood is being looked at when he only shot in the chest? Donald died to GSW to head so I am just confused
[6:57:03] lora1969: i dont think he'll be found guilty in court
[6:57:07] WolfxPax: or mayor pardon hims and makes him commissioner
[6:57:09] TimmayHS: Little Texas vs LSPD (on sight edition)
[6:57:13] lora1969: if he has good lawyers
[6:57:14] imationRip: Cornwood would never go crim on that character
[6:57:24] jessielight: wouldnt you have to charge the other officers too? I don't understand how you can pick just one?
[6:57:27] TimmayHS: @MoonLiit they're scared of the mayor and flailing

[6:58:15] Ikilledkenny91: PepeLaugh Donnie
[6:58:25] KilimanjaroTV: @MoonLiit insurance on removing cornwood from the pd essentially as far as I can tell Murder charge in a rp server where you only die if you want to kinda silly
[6:58:34] DonnBeach: Also would be interesting to see who the Judge would be because Cornwood is friendly with more than few
[6:58:35] jersey_jesus: PepeLaugh
[6:58:36] jessielight: @RealistReason yeah but you dont' know which one was the killing shot
[6:59:12] longhorns2565: Criminal use of firearm is prolly best and easiest tbh
[6:59:13] jessielight: cornwood took 19 bullets the days before and survived
[6:59:19] Eddie1225: chat still missing the point that the extra shot is the problem
[6:59:22] squonk513: trying to push the hardest charge is the cringe part here.

[6:59:38] jollypnda: @eddie1225 lol very true
[6:59:42] Wynter282: doesnt the fact that tehre was only 5 bullet holes show there wasnt any excessive force? no matter what cornwood said

[6:59:55] MoonLiit: @Eddie1225 I get that the extra shot is the issue, but if they are looking at a murder charge, then shouldn't the officer that shot Donald in the head be the one being looked at for that?
[6:59:58] dommeka: All of us...you have Ru th as a captian
[7:00:00] ArdentCause: easy OOC zoom officer immunity- make him a cadet gg
[7:00:00] paudiiie: Last bullet was in the heart, right? That means it's not the shot that killed him

[7:00:28] Eddie1225: im just waiting for al saab to be the rat king
[7:00:28] MoonLiit: @MoonLiit For transparency I think Cornwood should be charged just not with murder.
[7:00:31] sweartome: chatting why are you doing this?
[7:00:36] HeavyMetalKittenx: tobiiiChatting
[7:00:39] jessielight: as much as I truly hate this, like utterly despise the rp will be out of this world
[7:00:43] GodzFire3: The problem is game mechanics and game engine limitations make it scuffed at best too, because the amount of bullets are nowhere near the amount everyone shot.
[7:00:50] Eddie1225: @MoonLiit i mean thats why they are having this convo to see that they can push and stuff like that
[7:00:57] CurlyGumbo: @jollypnda i promise you i watched since the early days of 2.0 i just dont get the 180turn to pd being now an actual job for people. most cops i watch now have their mdt up for report writing most of the time when they stream. look im getting older, i play my dnd campaigns for years now. i just get the feeling this is a case of forced rp where not all partys are in agreement how far this "arc" should be played out. and i feel some partys try to railroad this arc a bit too hard saabSuffer

[7:01:47] squonk513: @jollypnda i promise you i watched since the early days of 2.0 i just dont get the 180turn to pd being now an actual job for people. most cops i watch now have their mdt up for report writing most of the time when they stream. look im getting older, i play my dnd campaigns for years now. i just get the feeling this is a case of forced rp where not all partys are in agreement how far this "arc" should be played out. and i feel some partys try to railroad this arc a bit too hard  saabSuffer
[7:01:59] Thedredgingjudge: I think we get the extra shot is the issue, its just who is to know that bullet was the kill shot? Bush coulda been killed from the first bullet that stuck him. Murder charge seems unwinnable desicration seems winnable and unlawful discharge of firearm

[8:33:14] cb_gutsywarrior: I told you slacks if you keep going down the road of corruption, Cornwood is going to go Walking Tall on you guys

[9:40:48] urkuri92: @Purecrew He stepped back, reloaded and then put the bullet in after everybody else stopped shooting LUL
[9:40:51] Clodhoppr: he won’t be able to win with that remark, multiple officers emptied rounds, he’d have to fight the final last bullet, that’s it
[9:40:52] boofhead7: the dude stabbed a police officer
[9:40:53] MRWOBBL3: that wasnt the case though lol
[9:41:00] RealistReason: @Honorspren Guess we will find out in court

[9:42:11] ShadowedSeraphim: wasnt there like 6 people there shooting?
[9:42:13] Lucsvm: @boofhead7 then he shot one more mag and 1 more shot
[9:42:15] Honorspren: @RealistReason dissenting opinions are allowed? i
[9:42:23] theonepieces: nice!
[9:42:24] foxylady48: What about the other officers that were shooting? shouldn't they be dapped
[9:42:35] DCSeth: what clip?
[9:42:35] Decimated_exo: @boofhead7 no he wasn’t. he was only one unloading in the body on the ground
[9:42:36] Zinnabunz: Dank
[9:42:48] Eddie1225: bro
[9:42:55] RealistReason: @Honorspren You called it weird...that's weird saabCringe
[9:42:57] WastelanderB: dapped they gonna be dragged into it by the defense

[9:43:00] Selfishfish: WAYTOODANK
[9:43:00] Eddie1225: like
[9:43:02] Lucsvm: all cops shot to neutralize the threat Cornwood shot 1 mag + 1 bullet "for fun"
[9:43:03] Decimated_exo: @foxylady48 they were not shooting at him on the ground
[9:43:07] Honorspren: @RealistReason and being a yesman isnt?

[9:43:30] Honorspren: @Honorspren disagreement is healthy, noone is being toxic
[9:43:31] DanLGG: My biggest issue with that shooting is how many of the shots missed LUL
[9:43:34] mk_735: how are so many people in this chat able to act this dumb lmao
[9:43:37] Eddie1225: shot *
[9:43:37] boofhead7: sooooooooo boring

[9:43:52] Lucsvm: ppl dont get it
[9:43:54] monkz89: @Eddie1225 we are twitch chat, we do not like nuance here
[9:43:56] Purecrew: Just sets a precedence that you have to be a "serious" RPer when playing cop. Pretty much all the mess around have fun cops have been severely dapped or already susspeneded/fired.
[9:43:56] shikari07: I don't think this city can handle Crimewood for 18 hours a day
[9:43:56] smalllittleisaac: maaan poor Slacks, he is in a hard place right now Sadge

[9:44:32] Decimated_exo: @purecrew you should not break the law as a cop, yes
[9:44:35] DiscretionaI: SBS content RP vs irl simulation
[9:44:38] stonedmikey: @rclemon_ someone with brain cells
[9:44:38] theonepieces: will he be found guilty ?
[9:44:41] TimmayHS: Slacks is taking all the machine gun fire for the other captains rt now, it's noble, but idk man
[9:44:46] deadwoodd_: the question at hand is when exactly did the death occur. trying to determine exactly which bullet is the one that killed him and proving that it was cornwood's bullet might be difficult i think, we'll see
[9:44:51] usn_orion: cant wait for cornwood in court lmao
[9:44:55] monkz89: CHARGE CORNWOOD ReallyMad
[9:45:16] Purecrew: @Decimated_exo Its about the Content for the creators playing cops, Serious cop RP just isn't something most people do.
[9:45:21] usn_orion: @theonepieces Maybe!!  Could go either way!
[9:45:36] Eddie1225: yea but saab you dont understand

[10:13:23] neonsloths: private convos are used in court all the time - her saying that means any actions that may be portrayed as her going against the council could be seen as treason - if they find out of course

[10:13:51] neonsloths: im just psyched to see what happens ngl
[10:13:55] rclemon_: If no one speaks up about the cornwoof situation then he will be found innocent
[10:14:01] BBCapitalist: like ssaab said he'll probably be found guilty of that and then pardoned
[10:14:10] rclemon_: If theres enough evidence to prosecute him he will be guilty
[10:14:12] rclemon_: simple as that

[12:33:42] MsHollyyy: @DonnBeach Sionhan also has a line of people to call and say. Don't take too long to think about it LULW
[12:33:42] monkz89: questioning = murder 2 OMEGALUL
[12:33:54] DonnBeach: @MsHollyyy Thats on her not him.
[12:34:17] MsHollyyy: @DonnBeach That's my point lmfao.
[12:34:17] Honorspren: cornwood was doomed when the 2 seniors where from shift 1 lol
[12:34:42] Chaoszero_goc: @Eddie1225 malton told ramee cornwood was getiting charged and ramme called cornwood.
[12:34:44] ShadowedSeraphim: if the captains aren't suspended with all thats going on
[12:35:04] Decimated_exo: idk how all this information you saw on other streams is relevant chat? from slacks POV cornwood brought all the people with him
[12:35:27] DonnBeach: @Decimated_exo That's an assumption
[12:35:29] Honorspren: @Decimated_exo cornwood told him that wasn't true though
[12:35:40] Decimated_exo: @donnbeach and???
[12:35:46] Sirlambsalot: Chatters getting mad when no matter what he'll end up getting pardoned, turn Sandy into  Little Texas and run it as sheriff.

[12:36:06] HeavyMetalKittenx: tobiiiChatting
[12:36:07] Honorspren: @Sirlambsalot differing opinions = mad?
[12:36:18] TimmayHS: @DonnBeach im pretty sure ramee was already there.. Cornwood didn't show up until way after everyone else. He was getting dressed remember?
[12:36:38] AngelKnivez: angelkzHowdy
[12:36:56] Hibob222: you took 12 ounuts phatty
[12:36:56] HeavyMetalKittenx: Angel saabH
[12:37:01] Decimated_exo: @donnbeach im saying that from Slacks pov (this character) cornwood brought those people. how thats stating it is a fact exactly?
[12:37:10] bioblade: CUM where?
[12:37:12] stellarnaut: you better give those out
[12:37:15] Hibob222: 12 dounuts just like the 12 names lol
[12:37:21] Chaoszero_goc: @Decimated_exo just cause they showed up doesnt mean he asked them to be there
[12:37:24] AngelKnivez: hope you’re enjoying rp been entertaining to watch
[12:37:34] TimmayHS: @Decimated_exo that's not true.. from Slacks POV, the mayor/siobhan/mr k/ramee showed up to the PD, then like 10 minutes later Cornwood showed up with Xavier.
[12:37:36] MsHollyyy: @Decimated_exo Because Cornwood literally told him when Slacks accused him of it?
[12:37:47] Sirlambsalot: @Honorspren No, just the mad chatters.
[12:37:47] Raithen2: @Decimated_exo Because even from Slacks's POV that can't be confirmed. He can assume that, but that's a bold and potentially harmful assumption that would be bad form

[12:39:41] JesusGVG: @DonnBeach didnt invite them, yet he felt no problem saying all the shit he said in front of them, so if he brought them or not doesnt matter that much
[12:39:43] WastelanderB: what did i miss that would make Slacks think Cornwood would lie to him ?? the guy bleeds pd
[12:39:54] DonnBeach: @MsHollyyy I don't know somehow I am reading you opposite
[12:39:58] Decimated_exo: @donnbeach slacks stated that he believed he brought those people, it is up to a character what he trusts and not to chat to dispute
[12:40:02] Honorspren: @JesusGVG to be fair, he was hurt and mad
