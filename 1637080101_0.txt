[8:19:16] TheLordSeaendithas: Has anyone actually turned a board in? KEKW
[8:19:17] Alusand: @UberHaxorNova how about theres a trade in sticker, so you turn in the 4 little seoul ones for a I completed it sticker
[8:19:22] 3spada_Grande: uhnShifty maybe if the game board was like the card binder and business had cards/ game piece
[8:19:23] babbyfatjuicycake: Nah they scammed that thing there‚Äôs a whole documentary about how people rigged major prozes
[8:19:24] Hogienightmare: The stamps they take them as redemption
[8:19:27] commander_sweetie: 1000 prizes = 1000 codes.  Once code is used. the code doesn't work anymore
[8:19:27] ooscoohehe: yea
[8:19:29] jayrimy: Mcdonalds takes the sticker
[8:19:30] nebrasken: i WORKED at Mcdonalds and ive NEVER taken a piece/board
[8:19:30] Crankster42: Track their corpoopoly tickets through sub-dermal Cerberus implants Corpa
[8:19:30] cryogenixx: no, you turn in tickets individually
[8:19:31] LumberChopMan: those smaller prizes you turn in on their own, they do not attach to the board, the ones that go on the board are the ones that require a whole set
[8:19:31] KimoyaFTW: why would u need it after?
[8:19:31] VenomVeinZ: yea
[8:19:32] wolfintheinferno2: They checked the forum
[8:19:32] jadehuynhh: the stickers they take
[8:19:35] Klax04: they took the pieces
[8:19:35] Wtfpeanuts: if you got just a fry you don't stick that to the board, they just take the sticker in that case
[8:19:35] DSrlaagyoenr: you dont put nothing on the board unless you fill it, everything else is just a single piece
[8:19:38] Hogienightmare: Not the board the stamps
[8:19:42] eatmyzazz: No they just took the little game piece
[8:19:44] reapereduardo: yes
[8:19:44] AvengingTragedy: a big stamp across the lines of property you've completed showing you'd redeemed it?
[8:19:46] EnsisAeternus: I think you can put them on the board and they take that too
[8:19:48] vahycant: Maybe got like a in game item that proves they have certain pieces
[8:19:49] cryogenixx: the board was just to store them
[8:19:49] blazinginferno24: yes
[8:19:51] Lickmysaltypeanut: WOOW
[8:19:51] EnsisAeternus: you can just get multiple boards
[8:19:52] BlooddMann: you arent suppose to glue the piece to the board permanent
[8:19:52] ooscoohehe: thats how you got the fries
[8:19:56] lessa_dragonfire: i think they had separate tickets for food prizes
[8:20:00] Maithiss: The board prestiges JamesPog

[8:20:07] 0xTas: YEP
[8:20:08] WYF_NA: the board is just for aesthetics
[8:20:08] vextg__: Two different stickers small prize stickers and the property sticker

[8:20:54] c0pp3rm00n: once removed the stickers have a mark as well
[8:20:59] VenomVeinZ: the whole board is a car or someshit
[8:21:00] Crankster42: Then what if you have two hubs completed and don't want to continue, have to choose between the two?

[8:22:00] LumberChopMan: McD also has the instant winners like "small fry" or other food items, not sure if that type of incentive is incorporated in corpoopoly?
[8:22:07] Keeb_city: that‚Äôs why it was a limited time run too to make ppl decide wether a quick claim or all board
[8:22:13] ThiccKetchuup: @GeneralAlucard poo c
[8:22:15] EnsisAeternus: would Corpoopoly also have 1 sticker in each group that is super rare and the rest are common?  or would it balance them
[8:22:16] bob_the_user: have  it open like a box
[8:22:20] ccoolracer128: ^
[8:22:22] Maithiss: can the board be a container?
[8:22:25] crispyglue112233: Keep it simple, you need to hand in the board to claim a prize
[8:22:27] bopum_: I just noticed Hades in the back KEK
[8:22:34] ClownyTheCrust: What if the business has a unique sticker that they place on the board to indicate when a set is complete?

[8:22:46] Kerkerino: if youre handing it to someone why do they need a board and not just hand in the stickers?
[8:22:53] BizzardMan101: maybe something like the photo album, you can see all the stickers and remove them selected ones
[8:22:57] venkaramon: claimed stickers given to businesses
[8:22:58] AvengingTragedy: once redeemed it's remove's he spot completely?
[8:23:00] killer_clown242: KEKW
[8:23:02] CARLBlazzer: Putting inspection machines everywhere might be too much
[8:23:07] TrekkG: just hand in the whole card and start over
[8:23:11] TrekkG: ?
[8:23:15] Kaitaake: could the stickers be tied into people who are signed into that job
[8:23:15] Wtfpeanuts: unless you could stamp over the 'redeemed' ones
[8:23:16] c0pp3rm00n: maybe a stamp over the hub?
[8:23:17] rennecker: would different boards for each hub work and then one big one
[8:23:19] nero_uchi: the card binder already works that way you can and cards and remove certain cards, so if you use the same system as that then they can hand over the board to the person for redemption and they can remove the stickers.
[8:23:20] DSrlaagyoenr: You could just do it in 2 different items, the first is a book that opens up and shows the rules and the map, and another that is a book to hold them
[8:23:20] Yeatti: just let anyone remove them then ppl can be robbed for their stickers
[8:23:21] fundead121: Have them hand over the board with the stickers, then have a button where you can remove certain stickers. Then they hand back the board.

[8:23:38] mlensed: maybe they need an item to peel it off ?
[8:23:45] LumberChopMan: will the game board be like the NP collectable cards and the pieces are the "cards"? Seem like NP already has a model similar for sorted collections of items?
[8:23:45] Fuccboi456: Can it work like the photo albums or the albums for the collectible cards?
[8:23:47] ParadoxMinty: maybe have a group of people that they hand the stickers into for a coupon for the item?
[8:23:50] mcn00bin: can you have 3 stages for an item? or only 2? you could have unused, used, redeemed, and then for full board you'd just take them.
[8:23:51] BRICKONE: Maybe each place has a tool that removes that piece
[8:24:00] truxillense: Chatting
[8:24:01] zrialf: You allow anyone to be able to remove stickers, if the person has all the ones for a hub they can take them off themselves and turn them in to a hub person
[8:24:12] venkaramon: claimed sticker for businesses
[8:24:13] peanut_butter_shake: Not sure if someone has mentioned this as an idea but maybe each business has "redeemed" stickers for their respective hub that can be added once they have all of the parts of a section? Then no removal mechanic is needed and it's easy to tell if they have recieved a reward
