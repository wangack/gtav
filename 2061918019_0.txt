[2:43:22] jinroh0207: What did you do with matto Kappa
[2:43:32] tqud: why are trying to get trillions even though max is 2 billion?
[2:43:38] corrosivescorpion: Tonya is the only side mission NPC, that's not in a special animation or sitting down when you arrive, correct?
[2:43:47] pippuz_058: Maude seeing her main Road full of C4 🗿
[2:43:49] AlexWhisker: what is blud doing

[2:44:07] ejohn34: Hao
[2:44:07] aodegard132978: RIP Mattos long beard
[2:44:14] onlypom_: maybe because she's not interacting with an object
[2:44:28] tqud: @jackathelegend huh?
[2:44:36] ejohn34: Hao misson
[2:44:38] luca682: what happened to the speedrun ive just got back ??
[2:44:39] jackathelegend: commencing
[2:44:59] cattogun97: Have you tried Mary Ann?
[2:45:03] PykPyke: Hi, what is happening right now?
[2:45:05] corrosivescorpion: Is Tonya is the only side mission NPC, that's not in a special animation or sitting down when you arrive?
[2:45:07] kingnova23: Hello Matto and Chatto! Hope you're all doing well!
[2:45:25] jackathelegend: @luca682 Finished ages ago, he's now trying to find more optimal ways to get om0 optimally

[2:46:04] viken0: Cool that you tried TF2, if you ever decide to try it again play on uncletopia servers, they are streamer friendly
[2:46:05] Skye_Blacke: It feels like the game treats Tanya as mid point between a Side mission and a main mission. Her marker has her name, you HAVE to do it to continue, and she interacts with the game uniquely
[2:46:11] Alrow__: tanya is built differently

[2:47:13] ejohn34: Why she scared when you shot and not when you aim?
[2:47:42] onlypom_: is mary ann side mission available at this point in the game ?
[2:47:45] Skye_Blacke: Hmm  It feels like the game treats Tanya as mid point between a Side mission and a main mission. Her marker has her name, you HAVE to do it to continue, and she interacts with the game uniquely
[2:47:46] lb215: i was about to ask that lol
[2:47:55] KarimFauzy: yeah i think there was something about them having dialogue with her

[2:48:19] HoppinAroundGTA: Does it have to be side missions? can it be a main mission like a Dom mission?
[2:48:39] onlypom_: no
[2:48:59] jackathelegend: Imagine just seeing a random black man just spawn in the street and spawn a comet out of no where then drive off
[2:49:07] pippuz_058: Have you already tried every single characters?

[2:53:59] peeter_lint: Hm
[2:54:08] Yassen_Diary: Matto has more but they are on different platform
[2:54:12] pippuz_058: Remember. This Is Rockstar
[2:54:14] bruzk2: She has crack powers
[2:54:17] ChopTwitch: cuz tonya a bitch!
[2:54:19] jinx_18_: Could it be because hers is technically a main mission?
[2:54:24] jaqwaddirt: She is special. Have you seen her?
[2:54:24] BobTheMartin: Tonya is so unique because she don't copy, she is original
[2:54:30] Yassen_Diary: @1_duffman I LOVE FISH dviperHappy
[2:54:35] jackathelegend: 5 chain of "hi" ruined by logurte, boo him

[2:54:56] TheCayoPerico: @KarimFauzy tried that already
[2:55:02] BobTheMartin: Copy that Kappa
[2:55:16] MrJucktmichnicht217: Maybe she is special because you have to do a mission for her to progress in the story
[2:55:17] Milo00200: what's he trying to do
[2:55:39] bruzk2: get the npc to run away but the mission to stay like with tonya @Milo00200
[2:55:47] jackathelegend: @Milo00200 Everything, I mean what isn't he trying to do?
[2:55:49] Milo00200: oooooh
[2:55:52] BobTheMartin: Tonya might realistically be unique because she is the first side mission
[2:55:56] dildoplocus: Hi Matto ! Hi Chat :)

[2:56:12] dildoplocus: okay okay

[2:56:17] GhostBob_: you are one of the speedrunners of all time
[2:56:22] KarimFauzy: For Trevor if not cletus then Josh has a similar approach thing for his first mission
[2:56:23] 1_duffman: Matt what’s your favourite McDonald’s burger?
[2:56:26] BobTheMartin: Is Tonyas first mission even flagged as side mission by game or is it technically a mission? You do have to complete it
[2:56:27] joshuabzz: are you the best gta speedrunner in sydney?
[2:56:32] SprayGT: Can I ask what you're attempting to do

[2:57:00] KarimFauzy: @TheCayoPerico Oh come on im too late KEKW
[2:57:00] realmattoau: dviperSad
[2:57:20] onlypom_: maybe it's because mary ann and the others are "interacting" with an object/in a special animation (cletus has a sniper rifle, barry and maude are sitting, the park ranger thing are standing against a bin (i think) while tonya is just standing and talking)
[2:57:30] TheCayoPerico: @TheCayoPerico dviperPat dviperGiggle

[3:42:00] 1_duffman: @drtshadowyt unless it was in the latest investor call they’ve never explicitly said that. With that said the pc port will probably come out later.
[3:42:09] Fossabot: Follow me at https://twitter.com/DarkViperAU for cute animal pictures, inane prattle and politics.
[3:42:11] shwety_: Have you tried the Seeking the Truth Mission?
[3:42:19] Yassen_Diary: @g1steezy Can't enter Facebook, don't have an account, and will not make one, it is annoying but never thought he was streaming there also :)

[3:44:57] Worlrlom: @Hugo__Andrade the tik tok, youtube and twitch chats are combined for him, but youtube and twitch appear on the stream below him
[3:44:57] Hugo__Andrade: Got it 👍
[3:45:05] FluxOxklint: @DarkViperAU The epsilon side missions?
[3:45:07] DrTShadowYT: @1_duffman Its not that it wont come out. I mean, most GTA's have has their PC port released 2 years after the console releass since its quite a hassle to port it so the most likely release date for PC is 2026 or 2027. Alot of people are annoyed about it but it is what it is. If you wanna play it just get a console but if you dont wanna get one then your just gonna have to wait. Feel bad for PC players ngl.
[3:45:10] goatonaboat7: There are still the epsilon missions
[3:45:14] damomeyer: hey Matt how do you feel about schools banning fairy bread
