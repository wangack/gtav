[6:17:24] KingCanadaHill: go for it Momo. Faraday has a great rep!🙌
[6:17:34] mahi_saka: yeah I'd say go for it but I also relate to feeling shy esp in roleplay lol
[6:17:50] MakeMyJay: i feel ya, but worse thing they can do is say no xD
[6:17:55] prez_wilson_28: adoreComfy
[6:17:57] Ambi_Trigger: 👀
[6:18:02] Siebzhen: @Momo  best advice I can give you is do it through official channels, but don't talk about it on stream because people do be stealing ideas some times
[6:18:06] mahi_saka: chupacabra containment unit
[6:18:07] Grothmar9: Never hurts to ask
[6:18:12] Warstratigier: sounds like a lab accident in the making....

[6:20:52] MakeMyJay: right
[6:20:57] Grothmar9: Best to just ask
[6:21:04] SCBarnabas: Hello 👋  Momo
[6:21:05] krenlash42: the worst thing they can say is no
[6:21:06] Grothmar9: Just a suggestion
[6:21:09] ZrO18: Nvr Noe until u try
[6:21:12] Hiki_Koro: No harm in asking
[6:21:15] krenlash42: but i imagine a lot of people would like it
[6:21:17] Warstratigier: if that's the case, the worse you're gonna get is the answer "no"
[6:21:19] krenlash42: it sounds really cool
[6:21:31] GrrizzlyGrrappler: Maks sense to me
[6:21:33] gashnal: yea but the worst thing there going to say is no, i feel like there not going to look down at you for having an idea.
[6:21:34] Flamquill: LUL
[6:21:36] KingCanadaHill: sounds like something interesting for the role play, the devs will like it
[6:21:41] Hiki_Koro: You bringing it up might give them the idea of it too if they never thought about it and they might like it too
[6:21:50] krenlash42: but i also know where you're coming from, i have that issue too
[6:21:55] prez_wilson_28: I feel like that's something that will Eventually come up in the server, so never he too afraid to ask
[6:21:57] capt_rosko: Maybe they didn't think it through? But you can still ask.  I get being nervous.  Maybe check with people you trust first if they like the idea. Mayne if several think it's a good idea it'll help
[6:22:18] dinglberriez: there is other irradiation stuff being pushed I’m sure they will take it in consideration, could be good rp for some
[6:22:38] capt_rosko: Are they just sick? Or like radiation zombies

[6:24:31] yoshkosh20: super irradiated peeps. skin falling off, all that sorta stuff. some are fine, others are feral. also long lived for some reason.
