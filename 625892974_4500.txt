[1:21:55] Magikaas: @Tombstone_Actual That was meant sarcastically LUL I have never heard of a poison reducing the speed of a bullet LUL
[1:22:07] Sheeple420: Yikes
[1:22:18] Sheeple420: Never planted mines in the games haha
[1:22:57] TombPlays: @Magikaas haha reduces combat effectiveness i guess
[1:22:58] allodude: from the e-hooooles
[1:23:24] Sheeple420: Yes
[1:23:29] TombPlays: unconventional in games for sure
[1:23:30] Akkara_: I think the opening cycle depends on turns, but blowing the legs might change the pattern of let you shoot it all the time.
[1:23:42] nicknastardly: We want a nice clean game. No prox bombs!
[1:23:45] Magikaas: @Tombstone_Actual Yeah, figured as much, after I posted that message, I thought it'd probably have more to do with effectiveness, like amount of bullets hit in a burst and where they hit.
[1:24:02] TombPlays: mmhmm
[1:24:19] TombPlays: this game really delivers so far eh
[1:24:39] mega_giga_harold: ye seems good

[1:29:54] TombPlays: @KyleSova88 agreed i think the fact it doesnt move
[1:29:56] LordAndSaviorJesusChris: So far this boss looks pretty brain dead
[1:29:58] Akkara_: If the enemies comes only via e-holes, this boss seems really safe to kill
[1:30:06] Magikaas: What happened there?
[1:30:10] IamLostinourRainbow: yogCrabs
[1:30:10] MasonGrateD227: He got cocky...
[1:30:11] Magikaas: Did he hit through the legs?
[1:30:12] TurdBlaster2000: Or he just opens every 2nd turn?
[1:30:24] IamLostinourRainbow: when in doubt
[1:30:33] Sheeple420: I dont think it triggers him to attack
[1:30:36] LordAndSaviorJesusChris: Break legs lets you get shots in every turn
[1:30:37] Scaedura: if you do 4000 in one go, does the shield just die?
[1:30:47] Nathanatwitch2: yeah lewis grenades aren't actually maing any difference
[1:30:52] TombPlays: @Scaedura he lifts his legs
[1:30:56] Sheeple420: he probably gets stunned when the legs are broken
[1:31:08] LordAndSaviorJesusChris: Health resets every turn, you just need to do all the damage in one go
[1:31:10] LordAndSaviorJesusChris: 2 frags
[1:31:23] IamLostinourRainbow: is he going to do the Duncan Spread His Legs
[1:31:31] Scaedura: Tombstone_Actual but i mean, does he permanently lose its legs after you've managed it or does he just gets it back next turn
[1:31:33] IamLostinourRainbow: yogH
[1:31:43] LordAndSaviorJesusChris: !duncan

[1:32:44] IamLostinourRainbow: boupheLewd
[1:32:47] mightyapricot: get away from blind corpser
[1:32:48] TurdBlaster2000: Thats one tough crane

[3:01:14] TombPlays: @volvic_squad a dev said in an interview that it just made sense to make the game because all they really had to do was move the camera

[3:03:00] pineapplejim: minimal effort I guess
[3:03:05] AnnaTonks: @shmollins definitely worth watching a game you like but not all colony crew, it's just too much content
