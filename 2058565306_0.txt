[4:30:46] busted912: Should rename the company X-ecute, and recruit members X has fucked over
[4:30:50] EvilEyeMonster_: @ArtemisRost mf RP isnt even real why does it matter to you who they bring in
[4:30:51] theoutcastboi: At the moment, there are four executives - that means there could be an even split in a vote. A new executive would prevent that and it'd also be the first time the company has gained an executive, it's only hemorrhaged them so far.
