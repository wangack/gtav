[4:52:52] milkydeew: It was discussed at the meeting, to spread the grows out so you don't have 50 bricks drying at the same time
[4:52:58] Nemo7: ^
[4:53:14] Sebastian1033: No sleep and getting aggitated is not the play sntGiggle

[4:54:23] DagsM8: I mean you should only be stressing out if there's no weed to sell. They know what they're doing
[4:54:33] Nemo7: They did tie in everyone and communicate at the meeting sntGiggle
[4:54:35] milkydeew: I mean if there are spaces and it doesn't affect the spread then fill em
[4:54:40] LoudNoise: also all you guys keep forgetting what you taked about all the time :)
[4:54:44] Sebastian1033: @Nemo7 KEKW
[4:55:05] r3_clay: you look short term.. they look longer term
[4:55:19] Sebastian1033: nodd
[4:55:24] DagsM8: If too many bricks dry at once it goes bad
[4:55:53] turntablist_mk2: have u ever ran out yet?

[4:56:34] Sebastian1033: There is only null stuff on the ground
[4:56:45] turntablist_mk2: @Kwni yeah they will adjust then i'm guessing
[4:56:52] 100rc: I think its more efficient to grow in small batches so there is a batch dry every day
[4:57:18] Kwni: need to adjust before it happens
[4:57:41] hicks9897: hello good morning
[4:57:49] r3_clay: so then you say 20 today, and then tomorrow add a rack to have space for 20 tomorrow. and then 20 the 3rd day.. instead of 15/15/15
[4:57:54] zahnik23: Gm hicks
[4:58:11] Kwni: was replying to turnt
[4:58:40] sheikhy: stop making sense

[5:06:00] zahnik23: @turntablist_mk2 LOL
[5:06:13] pelemi1: theres no more room on the racks
[5:06:21] sheikhy: how many breaks a day can u push?
[5:06:25] turntablist_mk2: is the loss of overdoing it alot of money though?
[5:06:28] sheikhy: bricks*
[5:06:37] Shanky_k: 15 bricks a days I roughly 5k investment..
[5:06:39] Tempah___: once you know what you can sell after scuff just grow more
[5:06:47] Sebastian1033: @sheikhy Good question nodd
[5:06:52] DagsM8: There's 2k bags ready to sell and there's about to be more
[5:06:56] chloe_shadow: @Tempah___ ^
[5:07:18] Essageo: dont matter if the initial load is a bit stale, that's better than running out when locals regain their minds and readjust then
[5:07:20] sheikhy: shouldnt there be bricks ready to replace dried bricks
[5:08:41] DagsM8: Yeah 1k I was counting other stuff
[5:10:27] rob_is_awsm: with new usb stuff n scuff at ur house computer u guys are already fallen behind no
[5:10:48] AtteTheBear: I mean idk if Id call it tweaking, it just needs to be communicated that weed production needs to be ramped up to compensate for the amount yall can push now
[5:10:49] milkydeew: It's better to do 15 15 15 than do 45 and there be nothing for 2 days. And you be complaining there's no weed and got to wait 2 days for a new dry.
[5:10:57] turntablist_mk2: it's just efficiency management till the scuff/speed of sales is fixed no?
[5:11:01] zahnik23: I have no opinions on the matter now LUL
[5:11:05] milkydeew: @rob_is_awsm not really considering the usb does nothing
