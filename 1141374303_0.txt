[5:06:28] PeonCrotchski: have you guys tried talking to the man wanting 10k while inside a vehicle? @UberHaxorNova
[5:06:28] Coop7r: flippy would probably have to carry the money when he gets back to the boss
[5:06:29] psylow_25: I think one day y’all gotta try 1 strain run but damn that’s expensive
[5:06:31] un_noiire: yeah it would be pretty neat mass cleaning dirty money
[5:06:35] pee_poopbutt: Would be proportionally risky to how much you wanted to clean too
[5:06:36] PeonCrotchski: 100K*
[5:06:41] Andrew_Finley: @unusedboot That's a neat idea too.
