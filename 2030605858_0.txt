[1:40:57] AshleyJordan235: @Ssaab and I'm sorry if you already addressed this obviously - but why does Ellie need to change her hair? It feels like dictating someone else's RP because its a super recognizable characteristic of her character model. It seemed so unnecessary after all the work she put in and sort of arbitrary so I was wondering what your thoughts were on it <3

[4:40:43] dylanconlon6: It tells u state Id on phone so he should be able to tell u
[4:40:46] Lucy757: Right it is one you can not do right this second so go with the RP at least I would. Not trying to backseat game.
[4:40:48] RoninGundam: i think duncan was right that if someone has an expired id then  more investigation is needed everytime

[7:54:23] icarusdjr: no broken arm in the medical report is bad

[8:12:15] LKG_Tre: @coherentscreams I'm talking about how you prove wreckless

[8:12:26] LKG_Tre: Negligence *
[8:12:29] dapyman: He was negligent because if he looked in his rear view mirror, side mirror, and over his shoulder then there is no blind spot.
[8:12:38] CoherentScreams: @LKG_Tre that might be tougher, could be up to a judge to determine based on the facts
[8:12:38] tr0kgaming: illegally parked in a emergency response location or something like that only charge could have gone for
[8:12:46] Silver_Sol_x: @luneamii that has no bearing
[8:12:47] buddha_hands: medical report doesn't say broken arm & also still on duty OMEGALAUGHING if he got hit at all, it must not have been bad

[8:14:34] RonJon: you two standing still while ramee walks in circles is so funny

[10:44:43] Eddie1225: OMEGALAUGHING
[10:44:45] Chuuclysm: Damn, Dean is getting so many DAPs. Sadge
[10:45:01] ndgvictim: Den is fired
[10:45:01] TTUCROWN: they charged him how is it an open investigation
[10:45:08] 3xevilx: Dean getting dapped up in all the wrong ways DAP
[10:45:11] Trixcross: he thought it was time to charge them which is why he handed it over, the mistake was thinking it was time to charge

[10:47:20] Mic_Stargazer: Ruth is so funny tbh
[10:47:21] Xethra: its not the same case, theft of pd equipment and extorsion of pd equipment are two different things  but maybe im wrong
[10:47:25] Artsii1994: SAY IT WITH YOUR CHEST
[10:47:28] ilySirzy: that "we'll see" tone was crazy
[10:47:38] fkingjagaloon: its almost condecending
[10:47:42] Xethra: why there would be two different reports
[10:48:04] ltl_wackman: @rclemon_ LETSGO CONFLICT RP
[10:48:08] MisterParry: @Xethra they stole a PD glock and tried to sell it back to Den Zel for 20k. It's kinda all the same
[10:48:36] Trixcross: wait if he gets 3 DAPs I literally called it would be 3 DAPs in his stream right as it happened
[10:48:46] Trixcross: letsgo NOOOO
[10:48:54] Turki_18: Dean is a content god icl i love him
[10:49:01] ltl_wackman: @Trixcross how many daps does that put him to if it happens
[10:49:06] Trixcross: 7
[10:49:08] MisterParry: 7
[10:49:26] MisterParry: same as Cornwood
[10:49:31] Xethra: how do you prove that the same person who stole the equipment are the same people who tried to sell it back (you can't use voiceid its not allowed).
[10:49:41] Trixcross: first 4 were for being negligent when he was apprehending someone who stabbed him lmao
[10:49:46] ScreenFresh: 5 is 24 hour suspension?
[10:49:51] Trixcross: @screenfresh yes
[10:49:55] ltl_wackman: NODDERS 5 is 24 hour
[10:49:56] Drkdream: yeah
[10:49:58] Trixcross: @ssaab if you get a choice try to give Dean the DAPs on monday cause he's off on Tuesday anyway lol
[10:50:19] MisterParry: @Xethra the person who stole it didn't wear a mask, and was later caught picking up the ransom
[10:50:25] ashadee63: @trixcross maybe don’t backseat and enjoy
[10:50:41] Xethra: @MisterParry but how do you prove that
[10:50:45] rodragil: Only on repeat mistakes i agree
[10:50:46] Drkdream: NODDERS
[10:50:49] d3vilmaydie: be condesecending FeelsEvilMan
[10:50:51] Xethra: testimony isnt enough
[10:51:05] Mic_Stargazer: can we pool channel points for an additional DAP?
[10:51:16] grandmole933: its no more condescending that the gross negligence definition
[10:51:32] Ned15: I mean Cops send some people to prison to reform, others get life LUL
[10:51:39] MisterParry: @Xethra they can probably prove it with the phone records, unless the crim used a back up sim. IDK how it could be proven without phone records. I think Den would need a snitch
[10:51:42] criquetRL: wrote “instead of” twice
[10:51:59] HustlerOneX: He might have to shelve Denzel for Den at this point lol
[10:52:27] Artsii1994: Instead of them instead of finding
[10:52:48] Xethra: they didn't subpoena the phone records though, and ran out of time of the 24h hold
[10:52:52] StreamElements: Make sure to check out my Youtube Channel!  saabHype -  https://cutt.ly/SaabYT
[10:52:56] grandmole933: the fuckup is that the suspect got charged and served his time, instead of them cutting him loose to do the investigate and push charges at a later date
[10:53:14] MisterParry: 100%
[10:53:28] Spikey770: it's DAP not DAB correct? You might have a typo if that matters to you
[10:53:36] Trixcross: @ssaab apologies if that was too much of a statement it was meant to be more of a question mb
[10:53:38] Artsii1994: Its Dap
[10:53:38] TTUCROWN: Agree but they told denz to go ahead and post the charges.
[10:53:42] grandmole933: then all this wrong charge and appeal issuses wouldn't have happened
[10:53:43] Xethra: obviously ooc things are different, but like mechanics and precedence are difficult
[10:53:52] StreamElements: Follow me on tiktok for stream highlights! https://www.tiktok.com/@ssaabster
[10:54:12] MisterParry: Den Zel and the other officers seem to want to press charges as soon as they have the suspect and they know the suspect is guilty. They need to wait until they can prove it too
[10:54:44] TTUCROWN: The whole team needs training on stacking because they were all discussing all the charges.
[10:54:53] king_saro: crane tried calling you
[10:55:27] Drkdream: saabWiggle
[10:55:43] grandmole933: half the reason they stack , is if it goes to a bench, and they have the wrong charge the whole thing gets thrown out, they need to be cutting loose and chargeing later more often
[10:55:54] Spikey770: Idk if it matters, but you have a typo in the 1032 section. You put DAB on the last line @Ssaab
[10:56:09] MikeOochieStank: yo does the rat king stream? trying to get some underworld stream on top of cops
[10:56:25] Drkdream: Sam Baas would take the call, while writing 3 reports during a 10-90 saabCop
[10:56:30] TTUCROWN: it was the same damn case shouldnt have been two reports
[10:56:31] coopvert: LUL
[10:56:44] zenyatta: peepoHey
[10:56:47] ImOome: why are there two reports of the same thing, not linked?
[10:56:47] Trixcross: deansoDab @spikey770
[10:56:49] ScreenFresh: So the second report is just extortion charge
[10:56:53] Celascion: i think partially why they need to stack charges is because they don't have a dedicated prosecutor. Most of the time the cops push things is because of their own ignorance rather than negligence NODDERS
[10:57:25] xnightshift2658: But what about starting the charge with the felony and then  they can only prove the misdemeanor in court?
[10:57:26] Xethra: @MisterParry absolutely, but you have a time period in which you can hold someone even if they are guilty. you can't just hold them forever.  Unfortunately things are not the same as IRL of course, so you're arguing with one arm behind your back, but you still have to do your do-diligence(sp) to prove beyond reasonable doubt
[10:57:39] MisterParry: I think he stacked charges because he didn't know which would stick Shruge
[10:57:45] grandmole933: @Celascion which is why cutting them lose and pushing the charges once they have everything figured out it what they should be doing
[10:58:00] Mic_Stargazer: @Celascion I don't actually want him DAPped but ignorance IS kind of negligence in this scenario, its their job
[10:58:06] Lord_Legolas: no, he didn't know about second report

[10:59:12] ndgvictim: the appeal is def gona pass
[10:59:18] Drkdream: HAHAHAHA
[10:59:37] Celascion: @Celascion nah i don't like that. That would undermine their foundational experience and understanding of the court process if they be fast and loose with it. to speak meta a bit, I think police has to take big Ls before they have a lawyer and a working legislature arm etc
[10:59:39] grandmole933: lol he was saying it wasn't a loss as he wasn't the lawyer for the case, Siobhan was

[11:17:26] TTUCROWN: about not coming numb to senior buns
[11:17:27] GlitchyByte: SlackGPT?
[11:17:27] Eddie1225: made him laugh
[11:17:28] Eddie1225: EZ

[11:17:41] Artsii1994: Least you made turner smile

[11:17:53] azmer1987: -1
[11:17:55] buddha_hands: the only way is to keep people engaged/interested/immersed in the calls so their mind doesn't go to like "welp time for snr buns #9745 of the day" lol
[11:17:55] captain_steve_420: @Trixcross I think its still unknown. It just depends on when the captains can all be on at once
[11:17:56] grandmole933: Impress upon the officers a need to be understanding of the sensitive nature of the situations they my be called to
[11:18:06] spiritwalkerz: Your the best Sabb!!!
[11:18:08] zenyatta: do you mean jaded?
[11:18:19] Trixcross: @captain_steve_420 makes sense ty
[11:18:36] azmer1987: They need to crank up the drip feed and not have 1 food spot
[11:18:38] yoshiebandit: to be able to*
[11:18:39] xnightshift2658: If officers show up and don't care, the civilians are going to lose faith in the PD
[11:18:53] Xethra: @Trixcross Ruth is sick irl
[11:18:59] surelyURjokingMrFeynman: I think if they crack down on crime at senior buns then the criminals and the witnesses will take things more seriously. So criminals less likely to randomly stab people and witnesses more likely to call cops.
[11:19:00] azmer1987: Mhm

[11:20:29] Aer09ne: Imagine when the bank gets robbed for the 3rd time...
[11:20:37] azmer1987: Turner just said a very powerful solution
[11:21:16] captain_steve_420: @jack5mikemotown Cornwell and Blackwell ignored a guy that told them about a stabbing at snr buns and made light of it, and instead of taking his statement, Cornwell went afk and Blackwell just went and got food from snr buns, so the guy trying to give his statement felt ignored and filed a complaint
[11:21:20] Marthentic: Deacon ooooh brother KEKW
[11:21:27] SharkzGG_: sus deacon
[11:21:49] azmer1987: Not "Dont look at jt that way" but knowing all human will feel a way, the solution isn't telling them change their attitude. It's changing the prior
[11:21:56] Xethra: @Trixcross she said on stream she was anticipating it but she doesn't always stream, and she said she was only sick on others streams. It will be great content when the 3 throw down but who knows when it will happen
[11:22:43] xnightshift2658: That meeting is going to be like 8 hours
[11:23:05] magnets_: yeah slacks may have to do that meeting off stream tbh
[11:23:26] jack5mikemotown: @jack5mikemotown gotcha gotcha ty ty
[11:23:43] yoshiebandit: wait does it actually say add criminal scum? lmao
[11:23:57] Trixcross: @xethra oh no guess we'll just have to watch nopixel all the time so we don't miss it NOOOO
[11:24:03] azmer1987: @magnets_ 3 streamers would all have to agree. Im not a fan of ooc behind scenes leaving viewers in dark
[11:24:05] Mic_Stargazer: because ramasquammy is innocent ReallyMad
[11:24:06] Xethra: I feel a bit bad for Cheever, she plays a fantastic character but people take it too literal. Same as Joffery. She is an intentional bitch, but its just in character
[11:24:08] langbtw: do you wanna know ooc why?
[11:24:19] xhorusx_: yes
[11:24:28] Xethra: Great RPer

[11:24:38] stewchootrain: @langbtw ???
[11:24:50] stewchootrain: is that you LOL
[11:25:03] leo_bwo: they unprocessed because they  wanted the arresting officers to check processed instead of cornwood.
[11:25:05] captain_steve_420: I dont think they'd do the meeting ooc. They all know a lot of viewers wanna see it happen. Itll just have to wait until they can all have a few hours together
[11:25:05] langbtw: Apparently it shows who selected processed so they unchecked it and is having the officer who booked them select processed - cornwood selected it them all as processed but unselected
[11:25:18] Trixcross: @xethra yeahhh she's suffocating under her own greatness. she needs a good mod team to shut haters in chat down as soon as they get ignorant
[11:25:48] Trixcross: must suck for her
[11:26:01] xnightshift2658: Not a fan of Ruth, but damn does she play her character so well
[11:26:08] Trixcross: hopefully she's enjoying the RP enough to outweigh it
[11:26:10] Zechss_: have a good half a day off my dude
[11:26:16] azmer1987: Seems the attitude of 4.0 is all in character rp. In character complaints ect. Ooc is a slap to viewers. Content server for the 500k watchers or 250 players
[11:26:19] Zechss_: oh nvm wrong chat
