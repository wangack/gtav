[8:07:19] Morothemic: The shitty part about this is that of the big three, only one is active. That's one of the biggest flaws with this so it really just falls onto Baas as the others aren't around enough to actually see anything

[8:08:16] Dazeee1: davenpog Gladge
[8:08:21] Morothemic: @OneOfManyMikes because he's not one of the big three. Andrews, soze, and baas are the top three. one of the three are active

[8:08:55] OneOfManyMikes: @Morothemic oh gotcha that makes sense
[8:08:56] llionell11: @buddha_hands what? i didnt mean taze baas, i mean pred tazed aziz cause he didnt go off duty, which muddy the situation
[8:08:57] PhilipIsTaken: So don't follow CoC but then don't get punished because of this weird system LUL
[8:08:58] Morothemic: @OneOfManyMikes So of the three people that are at the top, only one of the three is actually active. Pred, Torretti, and CoP is below those three

[8:11:07] PhilipIsTaken: Pred did that though?
