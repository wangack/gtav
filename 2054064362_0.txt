[0:17:34] Profirio_: have you made a decision about your daily driver car?
[0:17:42] toffeecity: neutrenLurk
[0:17:56] Profirio_: nodd
[0:18:00] marinos101: Someone in the crew figured something out
[0:18:19] randomnesz: have u seen xqc creation
[0:18:20] SapphirePandaa: I think the USB clue stuff is driving Harry, Yuno, and Marty actually insane lmao
[0:18:20] WentToBuyMilkAgain: Need to find the rainbow monkey
[0:18:23] azureforks: Goofy without a car D:
[0:18:29] Kyoto85: you sounded so dead yesterday on harry's stream
[0:18:31] l_egacy7: ye saw u with Harry LUL
[0:18:42] TheCickenwing: TheCickenwing subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 25 months! WOW
[0:18:42] Profirio_: @randomnesz you misspelled "abomination"
[0:18:55] randomnesz: hahaha trueeee my bad
[0:19:03] milllajs: Yuno figured out how to beat locals and Kitty learned that you need many bandages for these runs
[0:19:08] Kyoto85: uhoh grammar police is out
[0:19:29] TheCickenwing: neutrenHeart
[0:20:17] Exo_bot: yeah since you drive it a lot for this job
[0:20:23] yomipad: yea what's the point of having 2 2 door vehicles
[0:20:42] Bearpuff123: The car Marty has is a pretty nice 4 seater
[0:20:59] Profirio_: maybe kris could help?
[0:21:01] ReyJaggy: Maybe its server location?
[0:21:16] unbairu: I would imagine this is probably network issue, like lazy-loading the location and items data
[0:21:16] GILLETTEBESTAMANCANGET: who was it
[0:21:42] spittin77: Ott upgraded his CPU and it made the world of difference @neutren
[0:21:43] Mypka123: Maybe rendering distance lesser
[0:21:58] unbairu: Could be interesting to profile the network load when the lags happen, like do you download more stuff then?
[0:22:00] ConvexicMac: I thought with most things being server sided would cause less lag or no?
[0:22:17] milllajs: Some people don't have lags like at all, and some have lots of them 🤔
[0:22:45] spittin77: He is still using a 2080ti and the newer cpu stabalized it
[0:22:56] Exo_bot: that will be end of the year
[0:23:07] GILLETTEBESTAMANCANGET: just w8 no rush really
[0:23:09] Exo_bot: maybe consider the 40 super series if you don't want to wait
[0:23:10] NoobSniperr: Just noticed in your specs you're running 4x8GB sticks. Ryzen CPUs prefer dual channel but 2 sticks so 2x16GB at 3600mhz+ might offer more stability/less hitching
[0:23:23] Eatmypenguin: Does gta5 like the 3D cache on those AMD cpus? anyone know?
[0:23:44] azureforks: @eatmypenguin I think so yeah
[0:24:15] BlitzPang: BlitzPang subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months! 
[0:24:24] eastkaiyt: Tried to overclock? Or not into trying it?
[0:24:27] GILLETTEBESTAMANCANGET: w8 for new cpu release
[0:24:35] Exo_bot: for gta v I don't think you should be either
[0:24:37] Leow1n: o7
[0:24:38] xShikigami: o7
[0:24:39] ktothec99: I'm still using a 2070 RTX and don't really feel like I'm behind that much
[0:24:41] icehawks19: o7
[0:24:44] Profirio_: neutrenWait
[0:24:48] l_egacy7: PauseChamp turning on nitrous for PC
[0:24:57] NoobSniperr: Doesnt seem like a GPU issue, no. You're capped at 60 FPS, meaning more load is on the CPU, where RAM freq and timings matter more
[0:24:57] Vehe: PauseChamp
[0:24:58] ReyJaggy: Hodl
[0:25:00] milllajs: Esfand has quite a lot of lag and he should have quite good setup regarding he has his own company 😅
[0:25:03] ReyJaggy: HypePopcorn
[0:25:13] kennyvariety1: tony specs doesn't seem to drop below 50 fps in ss
[0:25:42] AnihilationX360: tony hits 25 sometimes
[0:25:55] l_egacy7: neutrenThumb
[0:25:57] kennyvariety1: when i was watching it didn't seem that bad
[0:26:04] Exo_bot: was it like this for you at the end of 3.0 as well?
[0:26:06] kennyvariety1: maybe certain areas
[0:26:22] ikitty: ikitLurk
[0:26:42] JudlapShe: hello ikitty
[0:26:42] Bearpuff123: Mornin Kitkat
[0:26:46] Dasperhue: good computers dont like gta aswell. then u have to cap the fps. i was running 400+ fps on project homecoming and i was lagging because of it so i had to cap it
[0:27:04] colonelsanders460: morning Kit Kat
[0:27:04] Z_people: Honestly I think the Southside lag comes from everyone owning houses down there filled with items but idk
[0:27:09] wheresjohnnyyy: hi kitty
[0:27:09] colonelsanders460: more than me lol
[0:27:11] Engomass: Overclocking and undervolting is good
[0:27:12] colonelsanders460: got 4hrs
[0:27:12] ikitty: dbbfhdjs don’t be calling me out
[0:27:18] Dbrou_: KEKW
[0:27:24] ktothec99: Cooling plays a big part in it as well. It's something people always forget about. I recently undervolted my CPU a little and it made such a massive difference for temps and performance
[0:27:26] wheresjohnnyyy: KEKW
[0:27:31] shadow__fx: neutrenSip
[0:27:57] Eatmypenguin: Decent airflow on your case?
[0:27:57] NoobSniperr: Yeah I always UV my GPUs for that exact reason. Minimal change in performance but up to 10C cooler under load
[0:28:22] Engomass: Yeah, all GPUs that are sold come with a higher voltage input that it needs, just for safety. Some can go really lower
[0:28:40] parvsolanki: Wassup neutren! how u been?
[0:28:46] parvsolanki: toonyH toonyH toonyH
[0:28:52] NoobSniperr: The only "upgrade" to your current rig would maybe be the 5800X3D but your 5800X is solid
[0:28:55] Moldur: just need a good PC sponsor KEKW
[0:29:03] Eatmypenguin: You could turn your current pc into a streaming pc for a 2 pc setup
[0:29:17] AnihilationX360: Got a 7800x3d and was able to offset -35 on 6 cores and -45 prime core and -402nd best core, was able to draw max of 20watts gaming with a temp of 30C was nuts
[0:29:35] azureforks: @anihilationx360 that's insane
[0:29:37] Profirio_: I slapped 6 fans and an AIO on my PC and never had temp problems KEKW
[0:29:44] Land_Of_Excuses: neutrenHi neutrenHi neutrenHi
[0:29:49] NoobSniperr: @AnihilationX360 How much of a performance hit vs stock config?
[0:29:49] potatokens: the lag from ss should have been fixed according to ray
[0:29:51] AnihilationX360: Yeah I think I hit the lottery for a cpu
[0:30:32] kennyvariety1: the lag in ss is most likely from people building their house incorrectly
[0:30:36] ktothec99: My AIO recently failed and it was a massive headache
[0:30:39] michiski222: peepoArriveandSit
[0:30:43] AnihilationX360: @noobsniperr I didn't lose and perf
[0:30:46] azureforks: New AMD cpus are crazy I got the 7600x but you might need the 3D extra cache
[0:30:47] Profirio_: Mich hai
[0:30:54] NoobSniperr: @ktothec99 Ugh yeah AIO's can be a pain in the ass when they fail
[0:31:02] Profirio_: @ktothec99 thats my biggest fear tbh
[0:31:06] xdannyx98: peepoArriveandSit
[0:31:09] NoobSniperr: @AnihilationX360 That's awesome then, definitely a top tier binned chip in that case

[0:32:32] tivolimine: hey is there engine braking with manual?
[0:32:35] Vehe: Lmao how
[0:32:44] Fugeki: what resolution do you play at? I’ve seen a lot of people getting decent frames with 1080p but it’s so ugh that resolution
[0:32:44] torchdoc999: So I went to this party n lost my rolex,  later I saw a lady stood on it, and a guy was harassing her and Pulling her arm, I went over and decked him, nobody abuses a woman, not on my watch
[0:32:52] NoobSniperr: @AnihilationX360 Very nice! Now to get yourself some 7400mhz kits detect17Evil
[0:32:53] Land_Of_Excuses: blank moment
[0:33:02] l_egacy7: good thing u wearing a helmet LUL
[0:33:43] stern_alan: do EMTs come when you’re on your own?
[0:33:46] AnihilationX360: @noobsniperr I remember asking a community and they said the 7000mhz and up didn't do well at the time.e with a 7800x3d cause the bios and chipsets were outdated
[0:34:00] awesomephilip11: does it give higher rep if you clean 5k in one run?
[0:34:13] kaantufekci34: neutrenHi
[0:34:17] Fugeki: 0.003 rep per dollar so yes
[0:34:26] AnihilationX360: @noobsniperr but the 7400kit was like 349$cad vs the 6000MHz at 229$
[0:34:30] awesomephilip11: Got  it @Fugeki  thank you!
[0:34:41] s13epy: Hey chat <3
[0:35:02] 7will23: dont forget dirty money brought in
[0:35:02] jaegerspielt: neutrenHi
[0:35:03] lanehaspepehands: rawr
[0:35:16] NoobSniperr: @AnihilationX360 Yeah definitely min-maxing with 7400mhz kits vs 6000mhz. Maybe 2-5% gain but not always supported by your mobo without BIOS/chipset updates like you mentioned
[0:35:22] magunbp: Are the ones in the corner not yours?
[0:35:46] OWBallaz: did you find the rainbow monkey usb at 7am? KEKW

[0:36:20] AnihilationX360: @noobsniperr I probably could do it now since they updated the x670e-a board I have but probably won't be for awhile since I just spent 1500$ on just 3 parts lol
[0:36:21] Mypka123: Pull out dirty cash I think
