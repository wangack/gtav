[4:53:30] Tuckerbonage: @ultimatestrife it will still be the same amount of time for the same worth so it will still be the same thats why they are hoping they get 50 or 60 for 4k
[4:53:34] The2b: That doesn't ccount the base price

[4:53:55] Ultimatestrife: @Tuckerbonage how is making 20 per, the same as making 40 per?
[4:54:00] tinytoadtiddies: uhnPoo
[4:54:04] queentier: @jerky_johanson lyndiLuv breaHey Hiya JJ
[4:54:16] Tweker: @Ultimatestrife because the price to make it doubled, so 40 is the same as 20 before
[4:54:19] jerky_johanson: @queentier queenie!!! uhnHeart hiya

[4:54:29] mezzanoon: Nino been thinking about the price a lot
[4:54:44] marcusi23: i think yall need to test the waters first
[4:54:44] Tuckerbonage: @ultimatestrife because the buy will be the same the old buy in is 2k for 20 and now the buy is 4k so if they get 40 its literally the same thing
[4:54:46] 0xygenhomie: letting nino control the price might fk you
[4:54:46] uni0n1: to be fair what they dont understand is that 4k for 40 is better then 2k for 20 its a huge buff if thats what it turns into
[4:54:48] marcusi23: yup
[4:54:49] Valaphar: @Tweker but they save time both downtime waiting for the batch to mature and to cook
[4:54:57] DagsM8: I have a feeling meth was intended to sell to players for like 500 a bag not to locals
[4:55:00] tinytoadtiddies: Nino is good but risky rn
[4:55:07] Ultimatestrife: @Tweker that's not what I'm asking, lol. i'm arguing that if they are making 40 per, instead of 20 per now, how is that NOT faster

[4:56:43] Ultimatestrife: @Tuckerbonage dude, you're missing the point, it's all about how much is made per batch if it costs the same. making 5 batches at 20 per is 100, vs 5 batches of 40 per whch is 200

[4:59:09] Ultimatestrife: @Tuckerbonage whether they break even or not depends on purity, since 68%+ will give them double than what they put in

[4:59:18] scp0049: uhnCozy
[4:59:18] The2b: If it goes up $1 each bag, you'll get $4950 just based on that $1 increase bag after 100 bags. This is before the base price of the meth @UberHaxorNova
[4:59:32] DoomsdayBomb: I do wonder what the plan was behind making normal cheap food items have the same effects as drugs
[4:59:41] GrogRy3: mantis15Bean
[4:59:41] uni0n1: @UberHaxorNova lets say it takes them 1 hr to do a batch would you rather get 20 bags in 1 hr for 2k or 40 bags in a hr for 4k keeping in mind every bag drives the sale price up by $1 that being said the more you can make per shot the better because of the compounding.
[4:59:53] tinytoadtiddies: for the rp i guess
[4:59:55] m0nkru: his cut his fire
[4:59:55] Tuckerbonage: @ultimatestrife they don't know how to change the purity yet getting 40 bags for 4k doesn't change that

[5:01:01] Ultimatestrife: @Tuckerbonage from what james has said they have made more better ones than bad ones

[5:41:02] Time2gam3: Scared key will get deleted tbh
[5:41:07] zrialf: key in a dumpster sounds like it could go reaaal bad lol
[5:41:08] Drax_1X: I think the key has to stay inside. So you don’t get locked in. Scout outside without a key
[5:41:10] bearrynice: wouldnt it be better if the key was inside. could still have someone scout
[5:41:10] Tuckerbonage: i would just have the key holder put the key in the apartment
[5:41:11] eternalism93: the 4th person scouting really doesn't need the key
[5:41:12] KyleAOR: Key inside one dude outside 100%

[5:42:52] KyleAOR: Key inside  100%
[5:42:54] RezaQ8: Inside makes more sense because of security
[5:43:05] Capitao8384: Why would you ever want it outside ?
[5:43:20] vodin__: You can always call a group to come in and kill the people outside
[5:43:25] himothydelaghetto: When did we pass the sub goal?
[5:43:27] JovakenGaming: they would need to be smart about getting the guy with the key

[10:14:16] AmnestX: ITs by strain it seems like. Would explain why what VIP gave you had its own strain name yeah?

[10:14:41] GreenHencel: maybe signature elaHmm
[10:14:43] uni0n1: @UberHaxorNova does that mean rep could is tied to the cooks batch
[10:14:48] tabooshk: You basically make rep for this one strain
[10:15:00] Wozzlezz: it could be a percentage based on rep. like 45% strain would need more to increase 100% cost
[10:15:05] Drax_1X: Or a lot of the same
[10:15:10] imSammers: oh man... think if someone's robbing ppl for meth tho and it's based on strain.
[10:15:12] tabooshk: its like heisenberg meth would have best rep and best price
[10:15:20] DudleyIsDumb: What if rep increase chance is based on purity? Like 100% is guaranteed rep increase?
[10:15:23] Voltorin: maybe it works its way up, so 100 purity affects all purity below it, but a 46 purity only affects 45 & below uhnHm
[10:15:34] mynameisdaleokay: It’s probably the purity
[10:15:38] ryy89: are the 60s the same strain as the 45s or 100s
[10:15:40] Drax_1X: or it doesn't go up everytime
[10:15:40] uni0n1: you would need to use same quality but different sign
[10:15:45] eiightbiitt: Need the blue stuff
[10:15:51] TheAmericanBaby: @uberhaxornova make 2 different strains with the same purity
[10:15:56] bechcity: Higher purity with a higher guarantee for rep increase would make sense too
[10:15:59] Blackerzez: Jebaited
[10:16:01] DudleyIsDumb: 45 purity has a 45% chance to increase rep? Something Like that? @uberhaxornova
[10:16:04] Tru7hyDv8: the 100% wasn't made by siz
[10:16:05] DemonicFaith: Maybe a combination of strain and purity generates the most? Like a Blue CSGO skin in Fac new vs a Red CSGO skin in Fac new? :)

[10:17:03] gingerrsss: Pepega 👍
[10:17:08] Wozzlezz: i feel like the correct test would be like multiple 45% and then do a 100%. to see if multiple 45 affect a 100% strain

[10:20:11] bechcity: 45 should go 119 if it helps it skip?
[10:20:17] uni0n1: @UberHaxorNova i think its the blue meth thing your batches are penguin-2 mabe the rep is tied to that and mabe not the player only real wahy to find out would be to sell 2 same strain different quality and also to sell the same strain with 2 players
[10:20:19] DrWyz: did the corner thing turn on? didn't see the pop up for waiting
[10:20:20] squoogelol: if its strain based, cooks are really valuable
[10:20:22] Goldfish_Vendor: so if its by strain then its not affected per player?

[10:22:15] Toggin1: It doesn't restart rep, because yours never restarted
[10:22:17] Kyndagh: So it does effect?
[10:22:20] wondervviener: interesting  uhnHm
[10:22:39] Devomatics: If you sold multiple 45 of the same strain, then that would prove you're theory of the same strain
