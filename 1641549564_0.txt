[1:37:21] GaziIlion: Who knows where Nunu's story will go POG
[1:37:25] dredraider: how about Hydra?

[1:38:05] Jostic: chat Pepega
[1:38:08] ceeilaa: it can sometimes take months because you really have to get a bond with people
[1:38:09] NaveThaShade: Hydra over ST tbh
[1:38:14] Jojoelo1010: Yesterday Ramee told his chat that he feels like he wants to keep the friendship with him and nunu going because she is actually a better person then he thought beforehand

[1:39:14] Lupe_G_: @jolo______ LULW
[1:39:18] jscottx13: At the end of the day the best fits; happen at the most random times. As long as nunu feels she's found purpose; her path will come organically
[1:39:18] itsmedaddyindahouse: they invested quite a lot of money into you ngl especially Benny
[1:39:42] ceeilaa: true

[1:40:51] itsmedaddyindahouse: Benny gave you insantly so much trust which is crazy
[1:41:00] kkreinaworld: nunu keeping her head low has helped her make money and she will eventually work her way up to her dream car and enough to keep herself afloat.
[1:41:00] Blazentreez: PG 18 is just so new and small hard to say if they will last
[1:41:09] call_me_high_: i mean u did help em a bit with the wear house as well
[1:41:29] bigchick2: monkaW
[1:41:36] GraciousLew: It be fun if you asked Mr K to teach you
[1:41:38] Jojoelo1010: Its a process, it will take a while but I feel like that is the way that nunu is heading rn
[1:41:54] Blazentreez: she will be ready at the start of 4.0 to know what she really wants to do i think
[1:42:06] itsmedaddyindahouse: they found a new guy last night and he was really good at shooting
[1:42:09] ceeilaa: @TheLuckiestLew that's so random
[1:42:09] Jojoelo1010: Imagine gangleader nunu initiating war with CG LOL

[1:42:59] its_RyanV: Yeah you honestly joined at the perfect time. Once you learn everything 4.0 wipe will be a fresh start for everybody
[1:43:28] Jojoelo1010: @its_RyanV The core of the big gangs is gonna be the same tho
[1:43:33] keikobeans: everyone start from 0
[1:43:35] Jostic: im so exited for wipe
[1:43:35] untagslight: think of 4.0 as a new server
[1:43:39] Lupe_G_: everyone forgets everything
[1:43:39] Tacklessdata: It wont happen probably for awhile still. Everything ets completely reset
[1:43:41] don_k_: ^^
[1:43:43] keikobeans: Just like a rust wipe
[1:43:43] RevMagicDonJon: $0
[1:43:45] dmjezo: u start from ground zero, everything in the city gets wiped
[1:43:46] AceWall: Everything, including relations starts from 0
[1:43:47] smej137: Yeah maybe don’t think about you’re own gang until 4.0
[1:43:54] AnakininNZ: Koil was saying that its still a while away
[1:43:55] RevMagicDonJon: no people do not forget everything
[1:43:56] AceWall: stories, everything wiped
[1:43:57] Tacklessdata: 3.0 you were allowed to remember stuff if you wanted. Some people keep the same crew some go all new
[1:43:57] its_RyanV: I dont think anybody knows yet. But i heard its like a fresh fresh start in 4.0
[1:43:59] D_Glizz: All assets/money wipe
[1:44:00] Ed_C: KEKW only worried baout the money ahahah
[1:44:02] Lupe_G_: widepeepoSad Song
[1:44:02] maxlbon: like a rust wipe
[1:44:07] keikobeans: I think all gangs are removed too, but you can keep the connection im not sure tho
[1:44:14] Migulator: Lmao, your face.
[1:44:17] thekbeanster: People decide if they want to remember thigns from before but most forget - gangs stay together but money, house, cars gone
[1:44:18] Goxich: your characters get deleted, u start with 0 money, and u dont know anyone in the city
[1:44:19] AceWall: So its not even experience for Nunu. Its experience for Nora
[1:44:20] Lupe_G_: nope
[1:44:21] Jostic: yeah its so nice cause this forces people to do diffrent things and gets peoples motivation to come back
[1:44:22] dmjezo: yeah you do
[1:44:23] untagslight: koil is thinking of starting maybe next year, you should learn comms, locations, etc to under the game better if youre gonna do gang rp
[1:44:24] GaziIlion: Yea you still have relationships its just money/guns etc
[1:44:26] Tacklessdata: Its up to each person pretty much.
[1:44:26] Planetrox: gangs are not removed
[1:44:29] kakavok: you know peoples you knew if you want to
[1:44:30] bigchick2: up to the player
[1:44:31] PaxofJax: Whens that?
[1:44:31] Tsax4x8: @AceWall Not true, characters are allowed to remember who they are.  Some people opt to not remember most people choose to remember.
[1:44:32] RevMagicDonJon: its up to the person to decide it you remember or not
[1:44:33] Ed_C: gunna spend another week making a character OMEGALUL
[1:44:34] GraciousLew: Nun should learn from MR k  to be a gang leader
[1:44:39] Tacklessdata: Buddha forgot everyone, but Siz remembered him which made it awkward
[1:44:39] kakavok: but you can forget everything
[1:44:42] NolimitRenn: With new heist and new things
[1:44:42] D_Glizz: You choose to remember or start fresh
[1:44:42] Nak_424: it's up to the characters if u want u can remember them or forget them
[1:44:43] maxlbon: you can choose to remember or not
[1:44:44] kakavok: if you choose to
[1:44:56] Nak_424: yea
[1:45:01] clueou: many people remembered
[1:45:02] GaziIlion: 90% of ppl remember
[1:45:02] Planetrox: almost everyone LUL
[1:45:11] Kaliboss: KEKW
[1:45:13] Tsax4x8: Pretty much everyone remembers
[1:45:14] D_Glizz: Everyone basically chooses to remember
[1:45:16] Lupe_G_: CLAASIC
[1:45:16] Nak_424: I mean most of the gangs remember
[1:45:18] dmjezo: chang gang basically remember everything from lik 2017
[1:45:19] Migulator: Ramee who?
[1:45:23] Jojoelo1010: If nunu start 4.0 like she started here she is gonna be the real shit
[1:45:29] keikobeans: So far we know the layout of the city will be completly changed too

[1:46:33] its_RyanV: It hasnt happened that many times, so no one really knows how this one will be
[1:46:36] thekbeanster: and right before the wipe, everyone goes crazy
[1:46:43] Goxich: u dont instantly recognize someone, you still have to introduce yourself and shit...bit of a RP around it
[1:46:54] smej137: I guess if they told people to forget everything people would just end up ‘accidentally’ bumping into the same people
[1:46:57] thekbeanster: @RevMagicDonJon not at the start
[1:47:06] dmjezo: think of it like amnesia
[1:47:16] don_k_: how long since the start of 3.0?

[1:47:49] jscottx13: Before being known as  Mr K he used to be known as Mr Chang in the early days
[1:47:53] thekbeanster: @RevMagicDonJon I mean I guess it depends who you watch
[1:47:56] Jojoelo1010: I have watched RatedEpicz for a few year now and I started watching Nora because Nunu is entertaining is fuck and when she ends stream I start watching Rated again. It's perfect LOL
[1:48:00] keikobeans: But no one knows how they gonna put 4.0 out yet, its all assumptions
[1:48:20] dmjezo: @the_lon3lyone1 I'm 82 years old
[1:48:20] Lupe_G_: CLASSIC OMEGALUL
[1:48:23] GaziIlion: Before 4.0 there is gonna be a 3.0 Hardcore server where you die quicker o7 Nunu KEKW

[1:49:16] weakchinboy: @GaziIlion hardcore is not 4.0
[1:49:19] clueou: not quicker, if you die your character can permanently die
[1:49:20] Tsax4x8: Theres gonna be a hardcore server and a server like this for 4.0  Per Koils words
[1:49:37] GaziIlion: @Tsax4x8 Naa its not 4.0 i heard Koil talk about it
[1:49:44] Jojoelo1010: @Jojoelo1010 They are both so entertaining and their GTA content is scarily the same and so good
[1:49:44] Blazentreez: i am so mad i cant remember how i found Nunu was a few days before she met ramee been super fun watching
[1:49:53] keikobeans: @don_k_ as far koil said you have like 1000HP pool on your character so if you keep diying without letting it restore you will get automatic permad

[6:32:46] Nightbot: Backseat gaming gets annoying and may result to accidental !meta. This includes telling Nora how to play and what to do next. Excessive backseat gaming may result in a timeout or ban without warning. Unless Nora asks chat for help, please chill and enjoy the content. Thank you. noraexGun
