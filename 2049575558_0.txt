[4:48:44] Fossabot: In role-playing games, metagaming is an "out of character" action where a player's character makes use of knowledge that the player is aware of but that the character is not meant to be aware of. Giving Moon information on what's happening in another stream facilitates metagaming and ruins the experience for everyone.
