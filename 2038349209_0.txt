[3:42:01] NonstopBlue: which one of the 3 cops gonna respond KEKW not they in court LUL
[3:42:01] fuga_sk: cops going show up 30mins after the fact and ask whats all this.
[3:42:03] Myki_Cameda: the cant even ptotect a fast food place from getting robbed on the hour
[3:42:03] Archangelos1: Your house is gonna be emptied till police even arrive KEKW
[3:42:04] ThePitfallover: Denzels got this awaree
[3:42:04] rem_oa: I guess you can toggle pd off
[3:42:05] Dankomanda: like ideally it would be good but its likely to be very unreliable
[3:42:05] TumNarDok: well over time that can work
[3:42:05] Delaser: Do they have to lockpick every door? I think the solution is to just have 15 doors in a row.
[3:42:05] apatetic: BTF will come back Prayge
[3:42:08] yeehaw_x: yeah not worth
[3:42:12] Goldflux: "hey cops come to my house being robbed thats full of illegal shit" KEKW
[3:42:13] bwehn: probably be better if G6 workers protected the house instead of police
[3:42:13] twoeuro: Den Zel and Cornwood would end up helping the robbers
[3:42:18] Fr0stwav3: Violet already said she only needs to do a weed grow once in a while, so you can just add the dryers and racks when its time for a weed harvest nodd
[3:42:28] PsychoBKilla: Barrels more secure than an entire house
[3:42:30] Sonaro8: or stuff in the car
[3:42:33] dume5330: can you take out harddrive with butcoin between storing?
[3:42:33] Syncrostrike: The amount of investment and cash flow that would be lost if the house got seized could never be offset by any amount of weed profits
[3:42:34] Boltaction_Babe: nodd
[3:42:37] ben0809: yuh
[3:42:44] Dakror: also parked cars are more secure tink
[3:42:44] SpectreUK: house needs a safe you can lock
[3:42:51] Archangelos1: Yeah why keep a valuable items in a space that can be robbed super easy.
[3:42:55] MJ77seven: and storing the expensive bp's when no one is using them
[3:43:08] candancejade: When drugs get good and you want a larger scale then maybe then
[3:43:08] Sufficate: need a panic room
[3:43:13] SpectreUK: if you could buy a safe with a passcode would be cool
[3:43:15] Khaza_: @MJ77seven either that or a separate bench elsewhere for special stuff
[3:43:16] Pertzaa: Are PCs illegal?
[3:43:18] doccthunder: plus the cops would have to make a good case for it and theres no hope there
[3:43:20] Archangelos1: Unless more secure stashes that cant be easily opened then keeping valuables in houses is a no go.
[3:43:29] mugcostanza: kyliebHmm
[3:43:38] Machatie: Rust base KEKW
[3:43:42] ralfyrich99: If someone has the key can they take the cars out?
[3:43:50] Sufficate: can you swap locks on 1 door or does it replace all locks ?
[3:43:56] illifis: Also... will the alarm even go off if they succeed the door "hack"?
[3:43:59] DarkFyreDevil1511: imagine 1 key for each door
[3:44:02] PsychoBKilla: Need a safe hiding behind a painting
[3:44:03] Dimonovi4: 2 -3 lockpicks minimum
[3:44:04] SpectreUK: Safes that have passcodes they would have to hack to get in would be cool
[3:44:05] Myki_Cameda: @Delaser at least different rooms for different things, each with its own door, keyed differently than the front. keep the security panel secure in the basement so they cant just pick one door and disable
[3:44:05] aluckynewb: time to honey com the house nodd
[3:44:06] comfycathie: time to open military grade home security crew
[3:44:08] dume5330: i could see safes and things coming in future
[3:44:14] Sonaro8: what storage options are there in furniture, maybe theres a locked chest or somthing that also needs lockpicked
[3:44:16] Reiv_: multiple doors with passcodes, and no one should know all codes... so need like 3 people to enter
[3:44:22] ralfyrich99: Having to lockpick those doors would be good for delaying people
[3:44:25] jaylop94: Is the Mining app downloaded yet for the rack?
[3:44:29] jinnytolls: Do you think people will start creating fake rooms with furniture hiding the entrance like with a bookshelf?
[3:44:39] Dankomanda: people cracked at bypassing the system would make it entirely obsolete then
[3:44:43] Hobbitbot: but yeah the idea of decentralizing the weed stuff out of the house and spread it out is a really sound one because then when it is worth something you're less likely to loose it all if someone gets got
[3:44:44] ScratRidd: hey, are you not in PD anymore?
[3:44:50] illifis: I assume there must be more changes coming because at the current state its basically exactly the same as it was.

[6:14:58] zaps6666: could they make it to need the 300 rep and not just the 100 rusty rep
[6:15:00] rmcgowan: Like, I see the vision and how they foresee mechanics making good money once systems get put in place. But who knows when that "eventually" will be reached and until then mechanics make no money
[6:15:11] prozorftw: NOTED
[6:15:11] dume5330: yea the g6 workers were installing turbos

[6:15:46] TheZYgnar: They'd still have to sign in but ye
[6:15:51] Darkri19: until engine swaps are 300 rep + its going to be rough
[6:15:51] axlbv: how come its so complicated?
[6:15:57] ben0809: Jamgie
[6:15:59] mugcostanza: cheaper mats cost to them using less parts and crafting at home
[6:16:00] rmcgowan: Add on top of that a system that outright encourages a race to the bottom on pricing, with the mechanics being the victims as one group or another decides they don't want to make money at all. And you can't even install performance parts at a profit because of that too
[6:16:02] dume5330: master mechanics would need to be harder for it to work
[6:16:03] wolflover2936: For mechanics but a plus for other workers
[6:16:03] Isen_Mage: you'll see them show up, sign in, repair, fuck off
[6:16:07] ThePitfallover: basically every change when you look at it from the no wl perspective has made it easier for people to do self-repairs as long as they're willing to do sanitation within their own circles
[6:16:08] ViolentAkuma: The best thing would be that other jobs degrade the rep
[6:16:09] zenatr: People rush master mechanic and just sign in to fix their own car then sign out is what I'm guessing
[6:16:09] PsychoBKilla: Mechanic work is pretty much a secondary class for so many people
[6:16:15] Fr0stwav3: honestly if you hit a certain threshold with a certain job, the others should lock you out of progression until you drop that jobs rep nodd
[6:16:17] ibruticus: Mechanics having 3 npcs kinda fucks up a lot tbh
[6:16:25] Meh17_: doing one other job should honestly be -50 mechanic rep
[6:16:26] killer90214: Alarm?
[6:16:30] PsychoBKilla: Yep
[6:16:32] NonstopBlue: yeah
[6:16:34] klugklug: true
[6:16:34] DabneyCollins: I think the main problem with the mechanic job is that you can sign in and then go anywhere and do whatever you want. All the other jobs are tied to a location or a routine with a work truck. Seems like it's not locked down enough
[6:16:37] ben0809: yuh
[6:16:38] DarkFyreDevil1511: i think 5% should be fore rusty and 20% for max rep
[6:16:39] BladedBuzzer: KEKW
[6:16:41] illifis: YEP
[6:16:42] mugcostanza: kyliebHmm
[6:16:43] CCGReaper3: nodd
[6:16:44] prozorftw: YEP
[6:16:45] L4zyb4ssturd: actually repairing car parts should give the most rep and nuke other jobs
[6:16:46] Boltaction_Babe: YEP 󠀀
[6:16:47] ibruticus: YEP
[6:16:49] SirHellsing1995: YEP 󠀀
[6:16:49] KewlKittyProductions: yep
[6:16:50] Isen_Mage: there's a bunch of people I know of with 300 mosley rep while also doing other jobs
[6:16:50] JimiiJam_: YEP
[6:16:54] eborcurean: no wl=do everything yourself
[6:16:57] Morningstarter: Rusty should go scorched earth on every other job
[6:16:57] itaraa1043: YEP
[6:16:58] aluckynewb: i think it need to be behind rep to do stuff
[6:16:58] prozorftw: literally ignored like 3 mechanic workers
[6:17:01] zaps6666: didnt ste work here
[6:17:01] dume5330: tried ot do it out of shop until you saw them/they couldn't
[6:17:04] alpacalunchuwu: hey kylie
[6:17:13] kingshwing: need a minimum rusty rep to examine cars right?
[6:17:16] BladedBuzzer: @aluckynewb it already is
[6:17:19] atgbliss: maybe thats what they want it to be
[6:17:22] spicychickenzz: is there a reason mechanic rep doesn't degrade from other jobs ?
[6:17:25] czhilli: yeah- the math penalises master mechanics who do it for a living
[6:17:28] Matrix8369: maybe they were mechanics from other shops?
[6:17:33] alpacalunchuwu: hey kylie how are u?
[6:17:39] ExorcistFi: Is anyone really a master mechanic if everyone is a master mechanic?
[6:17:46] prozorftw: I doubt thats intentional
[6:17:47] Tronno: FeelsDankMan
[6:17:52] aluckynewb: make other jobs nuke the rep
[6:17:54] mugcostanza: kyliebHmm
[6:17:55] BladedBuzzer: nodd
[6:17:57] ThePitfallover: the system as it stands is slowly proving true: if people CAN do it themselves, they will
[6:17:58] Achren: nodd
[6:17:58] prozorftw: nodd
[6:17:59] klugklug: nodd
[6:18:01] atrollusername: WHAT
[6:18:08] Meh17_: the whole mechanic system just doesn't work right with the way it is now
[6:18:09] zenatr: Nuke the rep if they do other work, right now they lose nothing
[6:18:10] IraExitium: yeah it seems like the mechanic system wasn't fully fleshed out yet
[6:18:11] BladedBuzzer: buggy, degredation removed, rep conflicts
[6:18:13] HotCocoaGamer: G6 employee that stopped being a mechanic comes back to the shop and uses their tools to swap a part.
[6:18:13] ibruticus: Its so different from other jobs its on its own level of issues
[6:18:14] Stoney_Mahoney: imagine people running into Snr. Buns and making your own burger LUL
[6:18:15] Machatie: I feel the system benefits when people get expensive cars fixed
[6:18:19] PsychoBKilla: nodd
[6:18:20] Isen_Mage: @ThePitfallover in a world of no WL, everyone wants to do everything themselves
[6:18:21] mugcostanza: yuh
[6:18:21] Plausibledeniability0: I think they are being pretty lenient atm as other stuff starts up
[6:18:23] FreefireHS: its like, u wouldnt walk into a random mechanic shop to work on ur car in IRL
[6:18:23] shpuddie: nodd
[6:18:23] DevonVanHalem: I just don't get why mosley's doesn't work like snr. buns (manager employs mechanic, you get clocked out when you leave the perimeter)
[6:18:24] kingshwing: maybe be master mechanic to make parts?
[6:18:31] wolflover2936: yea
[6:18:33] f4p__l0rd: Its like G6 DEV still working on job you just have to wait
[6:18:42] Qyuyu: next time rob their turbo
[6:18:46] Morningstarter: They won't do it if they loose 20 rep per action with other jobs
[6:18:47] Meh17_: you can just make 2 sets yourself and fix a 55% car KEKW
[6:18:50] SpectreUK: @DevonVanHalem because then other mechanic shops couldnt exist
[6:18:51] L4zyb4ssturd: Moselys rep not bein impacted by others, is one of the biggest problems
[6:18:54] mugcostanza: shdiHmm
[6:18:57] greatmuta2: Oh they are
[6:19:04] Sonaro8: makes me think the actual repairing part of being a mechanic is just the basics and the real meat and potatos of being one will be the tuning/engine rebuild stuff?
[6:19:06] wolflover2936: surely
[6:19:06] Sahneee: @greatmuta2, source ORF
[6:19:08] LZGhosT: i thought the disabling of crafting car parts via the scrub bench was a great thing, then it got reverted the next storm lol
[6:19:09] prozorftw: oh if they can...they will
[6:19:09] shpuddie: i dont think its all self repairs
[6:19:09] rmcgowan: I also think that they just need to lock down the number of mechanic shops that are even allowed right now. Even back in the height of 3.0, the city really couldn't support more than two active shops. There is only a finite number of repairs that can be done each day, every shop open spreads those repairs out more and more and more
[6:19:09] axlbv: how damage are the cars that people are driving
[6:19:10] macrotoad: is damagebeing felt again?
[6:19:10] SuperMegaPunch: uwuSIP
[6:19:11] axlbv: ?
[6:19:13] moboshobo: other shops?
[6:19:13] aluckynewb: i saw tow drivers repair they own truck KEKW
[6:19:13] ADStrike: Clueless
[6:19:16] StarEater_: or going to other sho[s
[6:19:16] Boltaction_Babe: Surely
[6:19:17] Jake472: that or they are going somewhere else getting there repairs
[6:19:18] csmithy: i wonder if there are logs of how many people are repairing cars compared to the amount of people working at shops
[6:19:21] TheWhiteWillow94: I don’t think that many people fix their own stuff tbh
[6:19:24] ibruticus: I saw a few G6 and Tow trucks be self repaired yesterday
[6:19:25] SpectreUK: Probably fixing them inside G6 hanger while waiting for next job LUL
[6:19:27] kingcloudii: not all of them but all the sani guys are doing their own trucks, whens the last time u saw a trashmaster?
[6:19:27] IraExitium: most are probably driving around with 20% parts and just slapping repair kits on it
[6:19:29] dume5330: ls customs does target them but nto sure how much they get
[6:19:29] NonstopBlue: yeah but they are min2 in a group and have atleast to 4 vans to switch arround
[6:19:30] greatmuta2: @sahneee I made it up
[6:19:30] NotBetsy: YEP it’s been stated things are going to go back and forth as devs are still working on things. hopefully, in time, the kinks get worked out kyliebLove
[6:19:40] ViolentAkuma: Running those jobs should destroy the mechanic rep
[6:19:41] Sahneee: @greatmuta2, classic
[6:19:44] candancejade: it's hard to say without any actual numbers to work with
[6:19:46] CptApples: they've had over a week to build up a set
[6:19:47] aluckynewb: just across mosley mechanic shop KEKW
[6:19:53] aluckynewb: thats the funny part
[6:19:55] comfycathie: doesnt tow also give mats now?
[6:19:55] Rex__84: It would be interesting going around with an admin menu that's for sure
[6:20:04] Thefat16: Its not even necessarily them doing it themselves but " knowing a guy"
[6:20:05] Machatie: Also I never seen a grime van in the shop
[6:20:06] PsychoBKilla: Chatting DEVGANG
[6:20:12] Morningstarter: people do 1set in their houses  check in do repairs somewhere else and you don't even have to come back to check out
[6:20:12] eborcurean: just get a friend, anything to avoid going to a mechanics and paying/engaging.especially if they're the sani-g6-mosley cross class combo
[6:20:12] storm_blessed_: I'm gonna get WL and repair my own car too aneEZ
[6:20:12] zenatr: They can make parts themselves, be master mechanic while doing their 'main' job, can do it for cheaper than a shop. Of course they're doing it themselvess LUL
[6:20:15] bwehn: i don't think the general use and degradation of cars is enough to really make any one shop busy all day
[6:20:17] Meh17_: There are probably lots of people fixing their own cars. You just can't see it because they never go to any mechanic shop
[6:20:17] Rex__84: Just watching people
[6:20:19] kessy1893: mechanic rep should get hit hard for running other jobs and it should be way harder to gain
[6:20:33] Qulnir: first step should be other jobs tanking mechanic rep
[6:20:35] neonishere32: kyliebCozy
[6:20:44] Boltaction_Babe: kyliebCozylove
[6:20:46] ThePitfallover: with the scarcity of job diversity most everyone probably has a friend who works at a mechanic shop or has access to parts to repair their cars
[6:20:51] dume5330: wouldn't you see more ppl signing in?
[6:20:54] mugcostanza: kyliebCozy
[6:21:00] candancejade: nodd
[6:21:02] aluckynewb: the easy way to fix it is make rep harder to get and the tool to fix cars need to be locked behind high rep xd
[6:21:03] IraExitium: most are probably driving around with 20% parts and just slapping repair kits on it and with damage not really mattering it works for them
[6:21:18] Fragger__23: Get all the mechanic NPCs into 1 guy so you can decay out of repairing
[6:21:22] kingshwing: but mech rep doesn't seem super valuable tho right?
[6:21:34] greatmuta2: Red will not be happy
[6:21:35] klugklug: i dont think you loose any if much rep doing other things than mosleys
[6:21:39] comfycathie: why not just do location based....
[6:21:41] Fr0stwav3: can you see every team active on rusty?
[6:21:48] Darkri19: or advanced toolsets should mean more than regular toolsets
[6:21:59] Morningstarter: you gain too much rep with mosley's jobs to get it up fast again
[6:22:05] lSoltisl: i still don't understand why the tool set is behind tow rep and tires behind mosley's
[6:22:08] KewlKittyProductions: and you get nothing 'special' like other jobs
[6:22:10] illifis: Is performance even restricted by rep?
[6:22:13] TheFightspit: Is Max still bugged?
[6:22:19] NonstopBlue: maybe you need rusty rep for the engine swaps soon?
[6:22:22] Fragger__23: And you will never decay those other 2 since you hit max already
[6:22:25] mugcostanza: kyliebHmm
[6:22:28] IraExitium: most of the max chrome stuff probably isn't enabled yet
[6:22:28] TheWhiteWillow94: I wonder why the advanced tool sets are completely useless ngl
[6:22:32] Fr0stwav3: an easy way to see is if you can see all the worker currently working for Rusty and their names KEKW
[6:22:38] aluckynewb: i think the last one is for what koil said is coming for mechanics
[6:22:40] Machatie: Also with cosmetic you can unpack the receipt yourself and give the parts?
[6:22:40] Fyzicul: this doesnt look like palworld?
[6:22:45] Meh17_: hopefully stuff changes now with the mayor coming in
[6:22:46] killer90214: just got to remember there are still things being added to the mechanic stuff, so im sure things will get fixed as time goes on, i wouldnt stress about it
[6:22:46] PsychoBKilla: staree
[6:22:48] kingshwing: should rep be tied to ability to manufacture parts?
[6:22:54] prozorftw: staree
[6:22:57] Sharingan420999: LUL
[6:22:59] HotCocoaGamer: I kinda wish that repairing outside a shop has a chance of further damaging your car or something.
[6:23:00] NonstopBlue: @Fr0stwav3 LUL
[6:23:05] CptApples: I think every group has some sani workers and a master mechanic so they can just do it all in house
[6:23:09] doccthunder: Smadge WTH FYZ
[6:23:15] greatmuta2: Kylie actually hates it now lol
[6:23:15] Fyzicul: ok like the game is bugged

[6:23:27] MJ77seven: but you can lure big mobs into shadis home
[6:23:30] PsychoBKilla: Smadge
