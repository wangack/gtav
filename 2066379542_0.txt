[0:54:12] NYYXX10: I tried to watch it, couldn't watch even a single episode PepeLa
[0:54:13] trash_kitty: tbf I guess that was a time where something like that just hadn‘t been on TV so maybe that‘s why they felt they had to force it
[0:54:26] londonwalker_: you should give Sense8 a try it's a pretty good show and not long
[0:54:27] pewthy: The new L word is better with those things, but it still feels unrealistic
[0:54:27] wujci28072001: I'm glad I didn't watch it as a younger person cause I would be scared to shit to come out as bi in my adult life Aware
[0:54:30] Sylar996: you should try Tokyo Vice it's a good show about an american reporter  investigating the Yakuza
[0:54:35] Thorekh: @londonwalker_, i love that show
[0:54:49] kingdomFX: so the L word isnt a lgbtq ally?

[0:55:03] Sylar996: second season is just starting so not a lot to catch up on
[0:55:15] wujci28072001: @kingdomfx it could be but because its old it's very very outdated
[0:55:21] Agathon_nl: Sylar996 yesss, enjoying it a lot. good inspiration for Moonlight Cabaret too pogg
[0:55:23] magic_freak: I always felt the bi and transphobia wasn't the shows view but characters in the show and they never made it a 'good' trait. But it was a long time since I saw it. wolfaShrug
[0:55:24] wujci28072001: YesYes
[0:55:24] pewthy: @kingdomFX It was at its time, because there was nothing like it, not now

[0:56:19] SqualkerAoD: Up Shihtz Creek does gay right in a TV show
[0:56:26] magic_freak: Will and Grace was fun but they played very much on stereotypes
[0:56:28] Thorekh: waiiiiiit meeting a person and getting married a week later is not a real representation? i thought that was the norm after watching rp
[0:56:37] Kroykumzz: OMEGADANCEBUTFAST
