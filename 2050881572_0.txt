[2:11:25] wingedsisterTalama: losing builds experience and teaches you what to watch for. But you also need to like, rewatch your replays for it to be actually effective.
[2:11:28] Fairlight_Excalibur: slightly better, yea, but if they are significantly better and you just spend the whole match on the floor you have learned nothing other than the other guy is very good LUL

[2:23:01] CrashAtoms: KEKW
[2:23:04] Fairlight_Excalibur: Low Parry - instead of holding down and back to low block, you call their bluff and press down+forward instead. You will catch her sweep and stun her. Takes a bit of practice to time it right. Works on every character.
[2:23:06] atrollusername: AINTNOWAY

[2:27:33] CrashAtoms: Have you done the combo challenges for Alisa?
[2:27:37] Fairlight_Excalibur: Okay but also King is BS and may violate the laws of Tekken at any time so KEKW
[2:27:51] DeadpanZak: the replay feature will tell you how to break those and how to punish in general
