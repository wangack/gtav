[0:37:14] ChemicalPpt: Employers aren't meant to discriminate anymore. Not here anyway
[0:37:15] sehpitt: It depends on why you got fired

[0:37:33] OvrGwn: I got fired cause managers shared their discount code to me and others, to do discounts for customers when managers cba to do their job, then their managers found out and made them fire me and the others. and not the managers
[0:37:34] ELefler: if they want you to go quietly and not sue you can get a "I left" agreement and a good reference from them
[0:37:36] Trissiex: in my country you recive differen uneployment bennefits based on the way you ended the job
[0:37:37] ELefler: And sometimes some money too

[0:37:38] Thorekh: quit = no money fired = money
[0:37:40] CmdrPain: you aren’t aloud to give negative reference
[0:37:55] CmdrPain: they just confirm you worked there
[0:38:03] pointless197: they can't really say much legally. they sometimes do because it's not like they let you listen in, but legally they can't much besides you worked there and whether they'd take you back
[0:38:04] OThorny: I later got contacted by the assistant manager to put in a formal complaint against the manager and then he got fired

[0:46:47] wossi_01: better deals or if they want work doing
[0:46:50] pointless197: to get money
[0:46:52] verynameless: get money out
[0:46:53] Chippedychip: Remortgage to do house renovation, get money
[0:46:53] PartTimeNinja_: Get money to pay of later
[0:46:55] Trissiex: its usually better that normal loan
[0:47:02] totonred: To release funds for extensions often
[0:47:04] eadwineii: Cheapest way to borrow money
[0:47:05] pewthy: Do they get money from remortgage?
[0:47:07] sophsophsoph_: Yeah im always confused too
[0:47:08] ChemicalPpt: Aye it's basically a loan
[0:47:09] greenmoose: they give you money, you pay a mortage basically
[0:47:11] ELefler: Get money out but make the mortgage last longer
[0:47:14] pointless197: you're basically borrowing money against the value of your house
[0:47:20] IceBadger: its like a security for the bank, so you get a better deal on interest rates
[0:47:27] sophsophsoph_: My parents wanna do it rn but they dont wanna be paying over again
[0:47:27] totonred: Yes
[0:47:29] stonedmikey: yes
[0:47:30] verynameless: yer
[0:47:31] roastplus: YesYes
[0:47:31] briluko: kind of yes
[0:47:32] Thorekh: NODDERS
[0:47:32] Ugnip42: you remortgage to go onto a new deal, deals typically only last fixed rates for 2/3/5 years, you can also remortgage for additional borrowing
[0:47:32] pewthy: Oooohhh
[0:47:33] verynameless: bigger loan
[0:47:33] Securitytss: yup
[0:47:36] ChemicalPpt: Yeah
[0:47:39] Kroykumzz: kinda yeah
[0:47:39] Haakky13: Its longer loan basically
[0:47:42] JohnJKnapp: if your home is valued at more than the current mortgage you can redo the loan for a higher amount and get cash out of it
[0:47:43] dabonychus: Robbing peter to pay Paul
[0:47:43] Dan_S__: most mortgages have a fixed period of interest and it goes up after 2-5 years, remortgage is to lock in a new deal
[0:47:44] Leg0s: remortgaging isn’t always the best cause they can hike up the term prices
[0:47:44] spAnser: Yeah pretty much but you are still pay interest.
[0:47:45] Chippedychip: So it's a big loan but against the property
[0:47:53] baggjie: mortgages are a cheap loan, use it to invest
[0:48:09] sophsophsoph_: It helps with renovating
[0:48:10] londonwalker_: it's the same reason when Scarlett got a second loan to pay the other one if you remember
[0:48:13] ChemicalPpt: Yeah usually if ya need a lot of money quick
[0:48:14] OvrGwn: if you overpay on mortgage you can also claim that money + more back
[0:48:14] Kamtae: if moneys tight it might be one of the best solutions
[0:48:17] JohnJKnapp: many people remortgage when interest rates drop so they can save money too.
[0:48:18] pointless197: yeah, my dad tried to go from 20 year to a 30 year. bank told him to fuck himself
[0:48:19] Dan_S__: it’s cheap money
[0:48:19] verynameless: we took money out to extend the house
[0:48:20] ELefler: If you have some emergency like needing a new boiler
[0:48:20] spAnser: Mortgage rates are probably cheaper than normal loans.
[0:48:20] Thorekh: if you are broke you need more money so you remortgage
[0:48:20] magic_freak: I am a little confused cause I missed the end of stream yesterday. Was the Ivy stuff offline?
[0:48:23] sophsophsoph_: Like wear and tear etc
[0:48:23] wossi_01: I'll be doing it in november as I want to expand my kitchen and dining room
[0:48:26] ChemicalPpt: He needed to buy a new car for the lady he crashed into
[0:48:27] eadwineii: Personal Loan may 12% interest, Mortgage 5%
[0:48:28] MiskyeXD: it can go both ways
[0:48:32] ChemicalPpt: So she wouldn't take him to court
[0:48:39] Ugnip42: you can do it to release equity from the property cause it’s cheaper to take it off the house than get a bank loan
[0:48:43] magic_freak: Thx wolfaL
[0:48:51] sophsophsoph_: Bro i cant even save money right n9w
[0:48:51] Shaws: STONKS

[0:49:25] JohnJKnapp: right now in the USA an average home mortgage interest rate is 7% or more. that will come down eventually and we will see a bunch of people refinancing their homes to get the now better rate.
[0:49:42] ChemicalPpt: My mum does be like oh just get a car on finance, just get a mortgage. With what moneyyyyyy DESKCHAN
[0:49:47] Ugnip42: arguably you stream more hours than a full time job
[0:49:48] magic_freak: Yup
[0:49:53] thantoscat: She's actually a real cop
[0:49:58] JohnJKnapp: by contrast my rate in 2017 was 3.2%
[0:50:00] briluko: They'll start to drop slowly in the next year
[0:50:01] Ugnip42: avg full time work is like 40 hrs per week

[0:51:14] pre_order_subs: That's my Admin wolfaHands
[0:51:15] ChemicalPpt: How much is that a week
[0:51:15] JohnJKnapp: high interinterest rates help the lenders and rich people with lots of money in high yield accounts. almost no normal person benefits from high rates.
[0:51:23] Brandonhipster: 160 is average for 40 a week
[0:51:33] Haakky13: 164? Not even 10 hour average a day smh
