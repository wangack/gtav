[6:28:16] tarantaika83: PogChamp
[6:28:20] Seetherrr: @SaintChedder probably using the sit command, you can sit in places you cant actually get to

[6:29:04] AUXdub: @crims0nlight some of us like imagining how the fight would go. no reason google has to ruin that :)
[6:29:06] KingTheTurtle: i'm loving shift 2 RP

[6:30:13] crims0nlight: @auxdub sure man, you can enjoy coming up with your own head-canon instead of learning facts
[6:30:13] SaintChedder: welp
[6:30:20] Rem753: DinkDonk mantis, fix
[6:30:20] Seetherrr: did they change that? used to be an hourly also
[6:30:20] mezzanoon: Time to deal drugs pentawPain
[6:30:35] skuffed39: no hourly weird
[6:30:47] justjon13: are you not employed by dmv ?
[6:30:47] badmattress: you almost closed a couple big ones
[6:30:50] ItsMeMattK: Time to take bribes to overlook bounties
[6:30:50] JasonJtran: Bounty hunting shitlording is peak
[6:30:51] SaintChedder: people were probably abusing the hourly pay
[6:30:51] AUXdub: @crims0nlight facts? I think you mean “theory”.
[6:30:53] Morri89: you can operate a little outside the law
[6:30:59] Hanglow365: no reports Gladge

[6:31:03] kripttik: Yeah server is primed for hat right now
[6:31:07] 0rbitalSpark: But I feel like that’s a bit OP…..
[6:31:08] miggyd: Is hat gonna be lawful or crim sided?
[6:31:10] Ralser2: @Icalldibs that is not true. The only credible study done on a gorillas strength showed them to be not that much atronger than the strongest humans, and even weaker in some lifts. All that superhuman strenght nonsense is just American pop culture myth from 90s tv shows
[6:31:11] JasonJtran: It's Jordan but without getting in trouble lmao
[6:31:12] sterowentUS: it's pretty much a 1 life character KEKW

[6:31:21] Schemon: hmmMeeting ye it would be an interesting spot
[6:31:25] columbothelieutenant: Yo
[6:31:25] deidara273: The fine system on ONX creates so much more RP than just billing someone
[6:31:26] Seetherrr: @SaintChedder i kinda doubt that, only a handful of people were approved bounty hunters and theyu were trustworthy people
[6:31:32] LargerDuckk: hats always fun to watch
[6:31:37] Flirting_Scholar: that grey zone is the sweet spot
[6:31:38] Icalldibs: Way better than cop rn
[6:31:40] crims0nlight: if only you could RP with Owen
[6:31:45] LargerDuckk: true but youll get sleepy
[6:31:49] bumpa3: bro there is so much shit going on during the day just need to look for it
[6:31:59] lon3ly_wo1f: it’s happening…he’s starting to believe
[6:32:01] LargerDuckk: true still kinda early
[6:32:09] mercifullrs: If you moved to 11am you'd collaborate more with penta
[6:32:10] mezzanoon: I enjoy the slow pace

[6:32:33] JustOrdinaryAlex: its gonna take a while to really set up the CID
[6:32:35] JasonJtran: How are more people down lol
[6:32:36] ItsMeMattK: theres nothing to take. Wrangler spend a whole shift yesterday escalating traffic stops and searching cars and got basically nothing.

[6:33:06] TheRealOrdinaryPaul: @justjon13 like 5am
[6:33:10] 0rbitalSpark: IMO, I feel like you need to give it a hard 6months to a year until you should go hard on folks….
[6:33:11] badmattress: lol
[6:33:12] KingTheTurtle: People paying 15+ hours is so dumb

[6:33:50] pastyface: good idea
[6:33:51] badmattress: yeah cap it
[6:33:55] justjon13: @auxdub that an app?
[6:33:55] Seetherrr: @KingTheTurtle I doubt people will be doing that, $50 an hour is .5 hrs of most jobs, i doubt people want to pay 7hrs of grinding just to "screw" meter people
[6:33:57] bumpa3: nah meters are horrible
[6:34:05] early_retirement: Penta would probably even be on board with that LUL
[6:34:06] IrrationallyUbiquitous: pentawWhat2 FUCK THOSE METERS
[6:34:08] AUXdub: @justjon13 website I believe
[6:34:11] badmattress: meters maid rp lol
[6:34:11] JasonJtran: I like meters. Have to be shorter
[6:34:12] PyroViking_: meters can be good, but they are horrible right now
[6:34:12] KingTheTurtle: @KingTheTurtle People have been literally max paying the meters lol
[6:34:17] Hanglow365: get rid of more valet spots if the server can handle it
[6:34:19] justjon13: @auxdub thanks
[6:34:22] klaatuNaatu: Meters would've been cool if there weren't people already doing their job
[6:34:25] sterowentUS: make it a pain in the ass if there isn't a person doing parking. that's how everything else is done when someone isn't around to do the job
[6:34:30] Seetherrr: @KingTheTurtle that was only seen right after they were installed, that was probably from them testing it after installing it
[6:34:32] miggyd: You guys hate meters cause Jordan can't tow let's be honest
[6:34:35] JasonJtran: Holy shit

[6:34:52] SylusDegalleE: and the city spawns
[6:35:00] KingTheTurtle: @KingTheTurtle Unfortunately there's no way to confirm your theory, and there is a way to confirm the meters are maxed out by people
[6:35:09] badmattress: television is dead
[6:35:12] KingTheTurtle: PEPW

[6:40:29] klaatuNaatu: Yeah it's perfect for when the parking guys aren't there
[6:40:30] sterowentUS: and attendants can offer the longer time needs
[6:40:37] nivada94: 15 minutes is too short, if you are in court, and have to park in front a court case can easily take longer then 15 minutes
[6:40:39] ItsMeMattK: He was griefing people out of cash using the attendants to say they didnt pay. They never really proved it, but decided to take it away.
[6:40:39] PyroViking_: yea thats a good
[6:40:46] AUXdub: meters are supposedly supposed to have a meter attendant you have to deal with
[6:40:55] Zedisalive: also if they are there for a longer time, there is already a valet nearby
[6:41:11] AUXdub: muted?
[6:41:15] SirSlyDingo: i was thinking he didnt like the paper trail so he could argue in the court since theres no proof how long the car was actually there for
