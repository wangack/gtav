[3:29:30] KatyCuckoo: @krazywizardfox valid ziggyjSmile
[3:30:04] DeceitWithin: Anti, what was that twat about caramelized rats or something AAAA
[3:30:24] KatyCuckoo: Those April fool's prank calls as Ziggy with Norman's voice was brilliant ziggyjLaugh
[3:30:25] SpookyKabookie: Listen, you can  do VA, but you also got like radio/ VO voice.... you should see if theres local stuff...  you will read the AD and send it through, audition .... but that also builds a reel
[3:30:51] TheShaunBro: @Ziggy I know its very 2010's but maybe a machinima for a reel?
[3:31:00] fatalnightshade: Ad is a great way to get experience and exposure tho
[3:31:04] eca0000: yes you’d be amazing for baddies in game or  shows
[3:31:13] Mystix_Plays: you could start on Fiver or something for small roles in people's projects
[3:31:30] NavigatedChaos: Can you look at the camera seductively for my set-up picture?
[3:31:44] SpookyKabookie: esp. if you not worried about getting the AD, have fun with it... try stuff out... be serious but you know  try some VA stuff
[3:31:53] SpookyKabookie: that or talent mgt
[3:31:54] Mystix_Plays: KEKW
[3:31:58] commiecassie: KEKW
[3:32:02] NavigatedChaos: Came out grand
[3:32:02] 98_tyra: KEKW
[3:32:08] TheShaunBro: Like it would give you experience recording over animation to match mouth movements etc @Ziggy
[3:32:15] SpookyKabookie: nodd  minefields
[3:32:15] natashabeth: was that seductively? that looked like you were held at gun point Kappa
[3:32:21] caze_the: @Ziggy a tip i got from another pro in that industry.... "Dont include the "In a wooorld..!" voice in your reel, and it will filter a lot of that stuff" ;)
[3:32:37] CianNino22: ziggyjGun
[3:32:40] getriggityrekt: found the stream from the "He is behind me isn't he" clip. Funny AF bro!
[3:32:41] Mystix_Plays: generally the voice acting
[3:32:44] TheShaunBro: animation
[3:32:50] REBREC86: animation
[3:33:09] TheShaunBro: depends on the company idk I'm just spit balling
[3:33:16] juliaswing: animation unless it is English made
[3:33:32] fatalnightshade: Sadly abridging kinda fell off a fair few VAs found their footing there and went pro later
[3:34:11] Rothryn: It really depends. Storyboard comes first, then a rough animation, then voice acting, then fleshing it all out, making it work together and then polish/rendering.
[3:34:13] getriggityrekt: I would guess it would be really easy to match voice to mouth movements over the opposite...
[3:34:24] natashabeth: I would want to VA game characters if I entered that industry
[3:34:43] Beefabee: AINTNOWAY
[3:34:56] Thedagda: Illidan Will always be my True leader in WoW

[3:42:55] Bindeir: Legion is my favourite forever and ever
[3:43:06] fatalnightshade: Legion was alright...
[3:43:10] SpookyKabookie: brokeSip  i was just teasing

[3:43:26] fatalnightshade: Mist was just fun
[3:43:46] Legendary497: So many marbles
[3:43:47] JadedHopeful: marbles is super fun
[3:43:51] hardyABARTH: i think the server im on just made it horrible cause people just rob no communication just they did what they wanted but no conversation i don’t mind being held hostage or robed but i don’t want to stress about the same people taking everything every time i log on i haven’t played role play for a year because of that and had lots of hours cars house grinding and after a year i lost everything but that doesn’t bother me
[3:43:56] Mystix_Plays: 4 gigs? thats a remaster for Marbles Kappa
[3:44:02] TheShaunBro: Last time I played to was cata
[3:44:26] fatalnightshade: Legion was hit or miss for me soo yeah a few of the guilds is ran with for years folded in legion soo kinda tainted it
[3:44:43] fatalnightshade: I*
[3:44:56] hardyABARTH: its just the other role players is not like Onx or Nopixel i just want to begin fresh on a server where i can have a conversation with people make friends except my Husband for 11 years i was 20 when we met just asking don’t have to answer what server do you suggest that is more role play

[3:46:09] Mystix_Plays: @JadedHopeful welp, we know your search history now
[3:46:16] fatalnightshade: So I went from consistently raiding to having to pug and yeah fuck that
[3:46:19] NavigatedChaos: Kind of tempted to give One-Arm Bandit a try. It's a free to play game like Payday
[3:46:23] NavigatedChaos: Less quality
[3:46:26] TheShaunBro: OK chat y'all have been cute but its time for me to bedge, have a good stream @Ziggy
[3:46:35] JadedHopeful: @mystix_plays that's just it! I haven't searched for anything like that
[3:46:40] NavigatedChaos: One Arm Robber*

[3:48:14] fatalnightshade: Also rp guild i was in disintegrated in levels of drama so massive I quit the server I rped on lol
[3:48:31] moiidd: KinitoPET was cool, Bazza played it
[3:48:31] Darkshift811: It's pretty solid, if you like diablo 4 but are too overwhelmed by POE it'
[3:48:35] Darkshift811: it's perfect
[3:48:44] Rozinky: I'm a fairly dedicated Path of Exile player and I'm enjoying last epoch, it's got a better crafting system. Not as complex, but well made when the servers aren't shitting themselves
[3:48:53] NavigatedChaos: Been tempted to give Enshrouded a try
[3:48:54] JadedHopeful: man RP is so fun when it's making stories but 'stories' turn into 'dramas' way too fast
[3:49:20] NavigatedChaos: I'll have to look into it some more
[3:49:47] fatalnightshade: Agree jaded
[3:49:53] EpicCRAZYWOLF: last epoch is good i am playing it right now i have over 100 hours in it so far
[3:49:57] XevianGaming: What up what up?
[3:50:06] Mystix_Plays: its only bad if that "drama" spills into OOC
[3:50:12] caze_the: pacific drive....very cool story and singleplayer experience.
[3:50:15] fatalnightshade: Nah wasn't i drama was pure OOC drama
[3:50:27] fatalnightshade: IC*
[3:50:29] JadedHopeful: Pacific drive looks interesting. You drive your car through a fucked up world, scavenging, there's some funky supernatural looking stuff too
[3:50:32] becauseimash2u: pacific drive is really run and cozy jesameCheeky
[3:50:40] XevianGaming: EVERYTHING MATTERS
[3:50:47] NavigatedChaos: I think the only driving game I'd be interested in is Trackmania
[3:50:47] iCandyNicoP: Don’t you enjoy Racing Games @ziggy
[3:50:51] XevianGaming: Shut up chat, you're all wrong.
[3:51:09] JadedHopeful: WHAT THE FUCK ZIGGY WHY DIDN'T YOU DO THE THING WE TOLD YOU TO DO.. GAWWD
[3:51:10] SpookyKabookie: ziggyjD  he hates chat you heard it here
[3:51:18] XevianGaming: I heard Ziggys mods suck.
[3:51:26] Rozinky: chat def seems like the worst part of rp streaming, people get so wrapped up in this shit and are just horrible
[3:51:27] hardyABARTH: you’re making scenes
[3:51:32] NavigatedChaos: Trackmania seems really difficult to learn.
[3:51:32] XevianGaming: ModCheck
[3:51:33] Mystix_Plays: If you have a toxic chat, you yourself feed that toxicity and i stand by that sentiment 100%
[3:51:34] boogalyboo: tell us about the 1/10 worst chat you've had
[3:51:39] fatalnightshade: Well adjusted and roleplay is as common a combo as vegans and beef dishes :p

[3:52:27] hardyABARTH: i lived it for a years lol just getting judged but me and my husband have u to make us laugh so thank you you Ziggy and Chat
[3:52:32] JadedHopeful: I'm proud of this chat too. Proud to be part of it. I get anxious about whether or not I'm crossing meta lines so I try to just limit myself to pretending I'm a braincell who occasionally reminds us of things we planned to do
[3:53:16] NavigatedChaos: Have a?

[3:57:09] JadedHopeful: If you're asking if Tex is in Nopixel 4.0 then yes.
[3:57:14] XevianGaming: @Ziggy We finally got our own place, and when Tommy is in town we are throwing a shindig. You gotta make the trip.
[3:57:15] thatsrebby: I need to find a good one myself. I just got accepted into the closed Beta for Daggerheart and want to playtest with my friends on the other side of the coast.

[4:00:26] JadedHopeful: *dies of D4 damage*
[4:00:26] NavigatedChaos: Takes a lot of mind
[4:00:29] Mystix_Plays: I am an avid Sorcerer/Wizard enjoyer
[4:00:41] Mialythilal: I haven’t played in a few years, but I always love playing half elves, druids, sorcerers or rogues lol
[4:00:43] NavigatedChaos: Do you dance?
[4:00:59] Mialythilal: oh and bards can be fun too
[4:01:04] fatalnightshade: Always wanted to try Dming but voice in head always made me chicken out
[4:01:13] Mystix_Plays: Fantasy Grounds is really good too, i knew i forgot one LUL
[4:01:21] fatalnightshade: Fantasy grounds is good used it for years
[4:01:21] JadedHopeful: I've always loved that Bards (and others I think) can essentially insult someone to death
[4:01:31] natashabeth: I always play a bard
[4:01:40] JadedHopeful: 'Your hairline sucks!' *enemy dies*
[4:01:50] CaptainSighmon: I've heard Eco is good I've got it in my wishlist as well
[4:02:21] Mystix_Plays: @fatalnightshade Its not as intimidating once you start. Just remember that everyone is there to have fun. I'd suggest watching a few vids to make sure you are prepared, but you will never be FULLY prepared, even with experience
[4:02:55] JadedHopeful: I'm a UI. Just ask my girlfriend
[4:03:03] JadedHopeful: nakkiSip
[4:03:07] Fossabot: If you redeemed a reward and it wasn't completed by Ziggy don't worry! A mod will refund it at the end of stream Modge
[4:03:13] fatalnightshade: Yeah I know it's just me giving the voice more power than I should @mystix_plays
[4:03:20] CianNino22: you can dm me if you want you dont have to be nervous
[4:03:23] CianNino22: silly ziggy
[4:03:26] NavigatedChaos: I think that'd be wonderful content
[4:03:45] NavigatedChaos: You should
[4:03:50] Mialythilal: I have DMed a couple times, but I can only last for a few sessions before I run out of ideas lol
[4:03:52] Mystix_Plays: @fatalnightshade If anything, turn that voice into a plot point and have it be a monster in game that feeds on self doubt. Turn it into fuel
[4:03:52] NavigatedChaos: Could make this a TalesSpire day
[4:03:56] thatsrebby: I've done it before. Its fun but can be a lot of work depending on how you run your game
[4:03:58] natashabeth: my dad character is always a bard who rick rolls everyone
[4:04:01] natashabeth: *dnd
[4:04:12] JadedHopeful: Alright Boys, Girls and Frenbies. I'm so close to finally finishing Dragon Age Inquisition for the first time after LITERALLY YEARS.
[4:04:12] CianNino22: dad character huh

[4:05:15] natashabeth: @ciannino22 okay nini ziggyjSip
[4:05:21] CianNino22: okkkk
[4:05:26] NavigatedChaos: I honestly bet a number of your friends would join a D&D session with you as the DM, if you told them it was your first experience with D&D ever.
[4:05:28] Mialythilal: I like the way the levels look, but I never got into the miniatures lol
[4:05:28] madgiiee: @Mystix_Plays start with the blood angels or the ultra marines
[4:05:31] natashabeth: ziggyjSip
[4:05:36] CianNino22: thats the wrong way around Susge
[4:05:52] Zechss_: @madgiiee worst choices smh

[4:06:28] actuallyZACHH: I feel like 2024 is a filler year, for movies, and 2025 is year of the games

[4:06:34] NavigatedChaos: Weird start

[4:06:48] hardyABARTH: @TheShaunBro THANX FOR THE GIFTED SUB IM TEXTING ON MY PHONE BUT WATCHING @Ziggy IN BED ON TV
[4:07:00] hardyABARTH: ITS LIKE WHITE NOISE
[4:07:00] NavigatedChaos: Sounds like your stuff if you did full videos like this and not clips
[4:07:16] SpookyKabookie: It's a sandbox.... it's a digital way to represent d&d but online with friends... you need a group, i dunno how much game is there
[4:07:22] Mystix_Plays: if you want to make minis (character figures) Hero Forge is REALLY good for it
[4:07:23] actuallyZACHH: BRUH I followed in 2019... ._.
[4:07:40] hardyABARTH: I watch vods to sleep lol I AM SUCH A LOSER
[4:07:50] hardyABARTH: 🤬
[4:07:59] Mystix_Plays: bro, gaming has been POPPING the last few years
[4:08:22] AnticrosslandDraws: Oop
[4:08:24] commiecassie: KEKW
[4:08:36] actuallyZACHH: GTA6 is going to break just like Helldivers2 i feel like
[4:08:38] Mystix_Plays: welp.. rip anyone on speakers with family around
[4:08:50] NavigatedChaos: I'm waiting for the game that updates about current events and wars that aren't being shared by the news.
[4:08:59] natashabeth: OK who in chat nearly snapped their necks after hearing that sound? Susge
[4:09:07] JadedHopeful: I mean this year we got Helldivers 2, We're getting DRAGONS DOGMA 2 which I'm MEGA hyped about. We're getting a new Fantasy Life iirc. We're getting (potentially) a Dragon Age 4
[4:09:09] SpookyKabookie: did you hear the sound effects, the editor wasn't  A+ lol
[4:09:22] AnticrosslandDraws: I'll just say Ziggy was watching porn
[4:09:27] NavigatedChaos: This is trailing on some
[4:09:45] natashabeth: ziggy watching hub of corn on stream NODDERS
[4:09:47] JoeyDangerouslyHD: new phobia unlocked.. this streamer was sent a package to her po box that she picked up and took home.. it had an airtag in it.. @Ziggy
[4:10:35] nat2shabby_: Yes
[4:10:37] natashabeth: I wanna be a murder hobo
[4:10:43] NavigatedChaos: I feel like this isn't explaining the game well
[4:10:56] JadedHopeful: GOTTEM
[4:10:57] actuallyZACHH: LMFAO
[4:10:59] thatsrebby: AAAA
[4:11:01] actuallyZACHH: LUL LUL LUL LUL
[4:11:08] Mystix_Plays: Then there is me, who has basically created 5.5E from homebrew rules and systems
[4:11:26] natashabeth: you got eick rolles
[4:11:53] NavigatedChaos: Would be cool to see a one-shot with this, to see how it's played
[4:11:58] actuallyZACHH: Looks like a W game for early access!
[4:12:08] AnticrosslandDraws: Looks fun.
[4:12:21] SpookyKabookie: this is going to require A LOT of learning... and late nights ( the program) but since you are fresh to it and D&D it could be a benefit
[4:12:50] nat2shabby_: I had a player who wanted to seduce every woman he came across, so I made one a super clingy cockblocker stereotype and he no longer pursued that
[4:13:02] NavigatedChaos: I mean for what it is
[4:13:07] JadedHopeful: @nat2shabby_ well played
[4:13:07] NavigatedChaos: THat's really good
[4:13:19] NavigatedChaos: So you're gonna grab it?
[4:13:34] SpookyKabookie: like i said you need a group, an prolly help world building... but this could be a Fun project
[4:13:35] Rothryn: That looks sick
[4:13:45] natashabeth: grab it by the balls and squeeze till you feel the joys of the game
[4:14:03] SpookyKabookie: oh
[4:14:11] NavigatedChaos: So Ziggy can recruit certain viewers to help
[4:14:44] AnticrosslandDraws: YES
