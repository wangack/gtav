[1:22:53] LilMaGooby: You can mine offline. My theory is that the rack is in a different room folder than the computer. Buddha had his mining rig stop working when he created room folders
[1:23:00] treofspades: no it does the racks and computer need to be in the same "room folder" in the editor to connect
[1:23:22] kangg: I‚Äôve heard people talking about rooms yesterday the Simone house has a server room and the pcs are in another room, I doubt it‚Äôs a rooms issue

[4:25:47] Insaif: Yeah...
[4:25:51] A_Humble_Wooper: NODDERS
[4:25:57] Kthanid: It WILL get better.
[4:25:58] Henshini: sometimes they can figure it out. when I had to give one of my cats insulin shots, he eventually figured out it made him feel better and stopped fighting it
[4:25:59] sharingiskaren: have you tied the calming pheromones like comfort zone?
[4:26:04] caitriamorrigan: katesHug my 14 year old cat is having trouble right now, too, I understand that feeling
[4:26:11] OhHeyRad: I get that. If it helps, it's probably more that she feels really rubbish that she's being grumpy with you than her thinking you're trying to do her wrong
[4:26:18] LilMaGooby: That's the struggle with cats. It can take a feew weeks before she warms up to you again
[4:26:18] kay_bs0919: This is exactly how mom guilt feels. like we are supposed to know what our baby needs but they can‚Äôt tell us what‚Äôs wrong so how can we fix it as soon as possible so they aren‚Äôt hurting or uncomfortable for any time at all
[4:26:22] HaikonD: I bought an empty dropper bottle, I mixed the squeeze pate for elderly cats with some milk and feed him like that
[4:26:54] A_Humble_Wooper: She's probably scared and confused, too. She's just as un-used to her being sick as you are.
[4:27:10] Crafty_Crystal: even if she could understand she would still hate everything that‚Äôs happening but the longer it happens the more she‚Äôll get use to it
[4:27:25] doc_sharon: stupid bread KEKW
[4:27:27] OhHeyRad: furry bread, probably
[4:27:45] hecktobreakfast: stupid bread! Istrappedabombonthatb
[4:27:49] spazzles: my Zeus didn't start acting old until she was 17.  some cats are very strong very late into their lives
[4:27:49] kangg: furry bread is just mould barbKEKD
[4:28:03] patcamper: @kay_bs0919 yes I remember when my son was sick for the first time. he would be crying and not eating and we kept on telling him buddy you gotta drink  :(
[4:28:34] doc_sharon: yeah that is really good Yesyes
[4:28:44] doc_sharon: KEKW
[4:28:47] That_One_Canadian_Guy: limesS
[4:28:49] kamelion84: katesGiggle
[4:28:53] spazzles: Rue this is not pit training!
[4:28:58] A_Humble_Wooper: Yeah, most creatures can go longer without food than they can without water.
[4:29:00] AshuraX13: Drinking water on her own is really good
[4:29:05] doc_sharon: Clap
[4:29:07] doc_sharon: well done
[4:29:30] kangg: katesSteer
[4:29:31] doc_sharon: you are Yesyes
[4:29:33] A_Humble_Wooper: It sounds like you are, yeah.
[4:29:37] sharingiskaren: that makes sense. you‚Äôre a great cat mom
[4:29:49] doc_sharon: yeah, that is unrealistic KEKW
[4:29:58] TheOtherCindy: yeah, not happening
[4:29:59] OhHeyRad: tiny paws picking up a tiny glass of water to wash it down
[4:30:00] hecktobreakfast: she's drinking water. wanting tap. all good signs. it sounds like you're doing every single thing possible to help.
[4:30:05] ImTooOldForThisShit: My willow is veeeery traumatized from liquid medications
[4:30:07] Siirika: Prolly also cats that are used to taking meds like that. and its basically Loaf's first time with all of it right?
[4:30:07] MyNameisTiff_: Those how-to videos are lies.
[4:30:08] doc_sharon: if Loaf did that, you would not have to look on a video KEKW
[4:30:18] StarDebris91: speaking of cats, were those all cats?
[4:30:18] AshuraX13: That doesn't sound like any cat I've known katesGiggle
[4:30:21] doc_sharon: katesPosh
[4:30:24] hecktobreakfast: exactly!
[4:30:25] if0rg0t2remember: unfortunately Loaf is having to deal with all of this at an advanced age and never learned it when young. But also her PTSD probably isn't helping you help her
[4:30:33] caitriamorrigan: yeah, my cats go feral when they're being given meds
[4:30:35] MyNameisTiff_: My cat slashed my face once when I tried to give her meds.
[4:30:42] hecktobreakfast: @StarDebris91 coyotes. or chupacabras if you're wade.
[4:30:44] TheOtherCindy: my cat would convince me she swallowed her pill, then I'd find it later on the couch
[4:30:45] doc_sharon: Loaf is less katesPosh and more katesYell
[4:30:46] Thorn104: how much gabapenton were those cats on to make it so easy good lord
[4:30:58] OhHeyRad: we had to wrap one of our cats up in a towel when it was medicine time. Felt like the cruellest people in the world
[4:30:58] SilentPain86: sounds like i would imagine a US ComercialLUL
[4:31:01] sharingiskaren: I‚Äôve had kittens spray medicine across the room instead of swallow it
[4:31:05] hecktobreakfast: @Thorn104 all of it.
[4:31:14] Elzcea: They need to make medicated cat food, that way you can just buy a can with the antibiotics pre-mixed in.
[4:31:25] doc_sharon: katesGiggles
[4:31:25] hecktobreakfast: katesPalm
[4:31:26] ImTooOldForThisShit: Have you tried putting her in a blanket or towel? There were timed I had to swaddle my cat in a towel. She wouldn't talk to me for days but she was medicated
[4:31:41] ImTooOldForThisShit: Damn
[4:31:42] caitriamorrigan: I have a cat that will take pills easily because you can wrap it in cheese but liquids are so hard
[4:31:48] spazzles: yeah some cats will fight to the death over stuff that works with other cats
[4:31:53] OhHeyRad: oh no withexSad
[4:32:19] hecktobreakfast: loaf is the cat version of the hulk?
[4:32:23] sharingiskaren: you will know the best way to
[4:32:28] sharingiskaren: do it
[4:32:31] spazzles: Zeus will not let me pill her or clip her claws.  Zeus will *ruin* me.  I have scars.  I have to convince Zeus to do things, not force it.
[4:33:01] ImTooOldForThisShit: How is she with pills?
[4:33:42] ImTooOldForThisShit: I wonder if you could do med times after her gabapentin??
[4:34:14] Nightbot: Follow Kate on Instagram! instagram.com/kate.ttv
[4:34:28] A_Humble_Wooper: katesPlot
[4:34:28] spazzles: gabapentin doesn't mix well in water solution, is what I've found
[4:34:52] Crafty_Crystal: I have a rescue like that, he‚Äôll fight anything and everything and another cat that lets me do anything including bathe him without any resistance.
[4:34:55] doc_sharon: plus, if the gabapentin makes her sleepy, it might make us worry she is getting worse katesHm
[4:35:03] sharingiskaren: I also put the gabapentin in wet food
[4:35:33] hecktobreakfast: katesHug
[4:35:37] doc_sharon: katesHug you are doing great - it's tough
[4:35:44] abblepiewit: katesHug katesL
[4:35:46] AshuraX13: katesHug
[4:36:03] Siirika: Mhm, and if your food syringe idea works later, might get her appetite coming back from that to katesL
[4:36:08] spazzles: to get Zeus to take her gabapentin when she's being picky, I get a can of tuna in water.  I squeeze the water out of the can into a small bowl, then sprinkle the gabapentin on the top.  Zeus drinks the tuna water, and the surface tension (because the gabapentin floats on top) makes it so she gets a good dose even if she only drinks a little bit of it
[4:36:29] doc_sharon: ya
[4:36:34] Kthanid: You have a whole other week still for her to improve, that's a LONG time for it to clear up.
[4:37:05] caitriamorrigan: yeah, hopefully with her drinking water now her appetite will pick up and she'll be on the mend before then
[4:37:16] A_Humble_Wooper: She's already improved a little bit, hopefully she'll at least be eating by then.
[4:37:17] Kthanid: Also, you're doing great for this being your first pet health incident.

[4:42:13] hecktobreakfast: I had a dog in college that was getting on in years. 15 at the time. And I took him in for dental work. When I picked him up they told me how many teeth they'd had to pull and I was devastated. I came home and SOBBED. Even though I had done the right thing and he was feeling better, I SOBBED because I'd felt like I'd done the wrong thing. Health stuff is difficult and with older pets, it's even more difficult.
