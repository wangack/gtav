[0:04:56] StreamElements: Do not share in-game information regarding other players/content creators. Acie doesn't want to know and this can instead harm in-game decisions. This may result to a time out or ban without warning. (Meta-gaming is when you tell Acie what a different streamer is doing on the same server) Thank you.

[7:46:39] vMvrda: the conference table says, we are all equal but the big desk says "someone's" in charge, these narrative matter with a business meeting setting, my opinion is the big table with chairs all around was a great idea, it had a nice feel walking into it and kinda fit wit the wood floors, but what do i know, my opinion is trash
[7:46:48] Bocha___: @Phasehero that and he would never waste time using emote to sit there LUL
