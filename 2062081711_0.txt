[3:47:46] IsaackEz: Air 1 inc KEKW
[3:47:46] Guielme: bikes are sooo lame to watch
[3:47:52] mrats: They use bikes to avoid pits, can't blame them
[3:47:53] yossilives: if they have a gun they’re going to do anything to get out
[3:47:53] gamerblue7: u did well imo
[3:47:54] Artsii1994: Yea im not a fan either but it is what it is
[3:47:55] ItsBillz: i think criminals would use less bikes if they could lockpick good local cars
[3:47:56] DeadAssYeetOnEm: Shoot on sight ReallyGunPull
[3:47:57] Cauterize__: bike chases are boring if its for something high stakes
[3:47:58] schLONG412: I mean they are fragile they hit one thing and it’s done
[3:48:00] WebGems: bikes easy mode
[3:48:02] JakoLegend118: maybe need to buff pd bike?
[3:48:06] OLDmanHARU: they use bikes.. need to upgrade pd either bike or air1
[3:48:09] castorrioux4: PD have bikes too no?
[3:48:13] bajbae: at least bikes only go like 80mph in 4.0, I still remember the bike in 3.0 that could hit like 200 LULW
[3:48:13] og_phantom5: I think bikes are dangerous and risky play. Cops just need to get more bikes is all no?
[3:48:18] doritoev: bikes are also very volatile if they crash they die
[3:48:19] Kevz95: only way to counter bikes is to force bikers into crashes of any kind.
[3:48:23] Satic: PD do not have actual bikes
[3:48:26] Velatile: @bajbae some hit 100
[3:48:27] indiangummmy: yeah theres bearly any cars you can lockpick they take what they can get
[3:48:28] UrNotReza: more than that
[3:48:29] og_phantom5: If bikes remain under 100 speed it would be good
[3:48:37] cjohno20: 1 crash on a bike = DNA = gg
[3:48:37] Cauterize__: if there was more than 3 local cars that were decent i think less bikes would be used
[3:48:41] dontony617: Lol
[3:48:45] Guielme: @doritoev no risk, go 50mph they cant pit you
[3:48:54] Guielme: until you get to a bike rat strat
[3:48:56] dakota22446: saabW
[3:48:57] GearGrinder259: You know what would be kinda fun but not really realistic is if PD got their own version of a bullet bike or something.
[3:48:59] TheTourist_: need to dig up baas and find that old tunnel system graphic
[3:48:59] rubberbreaker: I mean bikes are harder for criminals too it's not like a car you run into something you are screwed
[3:49:06] ugaverty: Taurus against locals cars are cheese
[3:49:08] Virtux_: high risk, high reward. He was in a slow truck for a good time

[3:49:38] Firsthandpower: @ugaverty you've got to be joking lolll
[3:49:41] cjohno20: all of them were local cars tbf, right?
[3:49:42] GrumpyTreeFrog: there are some weird chatters today
[3:49:43] jujinka_tv: crims can only lockpick like 3 things that arent a bike, plus the pits have been sending people through windshields a lot. Prob gonna see more bikes. Hope the PD gets bike units.
[3:49:44] V01Dwitch: all anyone can do at that point is prioritize one crime and do the best handling that

[3:49:53] yellowtristan: @ugotsnuked or just give cops better bikes
[3:49:53] Virtux_: If only crims could coordinate to not do crime at the same time, that would be great Staring
[3:50:01] jhazlett37: baas would of caught them
[3:50:24] Firsthandpower: @ugaverty plus pd cars are literally like paper compared to "civ" cars lol
[3:50:26] kevol33t: @yellowtristan the crim bikes are bad too lmao must be a skill issue
[3:50:35] lookingfornothinghere: after this chase Slacks needs to see an eye doctor PepeLaugh
[3:50:42] warlock7709: wheres captain turner been
[3:50:43] nxrkAFL: @kevol33t yea they suck
[3:50:43] DanLGG: that’s the nature of shift two. it’s usually either nothing going on or everything going on at the same time
[3:50:47] realpossible: bikes have pro's and cons, i think the pd just need some bike cops and it will be fine but if you wreck on a bike theres dna on scene and you can get injured and move slow
[3:50:48] jersey_jesus: Damn now I want a burger peepoFat
[3:50:53] yellowtristan: @kevol33t oh really? then yeah get better I guess

[3:51:25] srejok: that cop kinda sounds like adam a little bit lol
[3:51:26] jhazlett37: 100% washed. Sam Baas was better
[3:51:26] khrow: Baas wouldnt have lost them FeelsBadMan
[3:51:30] MsFreya_x: @Abdoullah21 He and aziz had a shower last night at the meeting so yeah he is washed
[3:51:30] talamah: Chatting crim bikes are bad too, they totally go the same speed as the pd bikes
[3:51:31] DanLGG: You did good.
[3:51:36] Chaoszero_goc: all rp
[3:51:39] jay2seam: not a LeanBoi anymore...
[3:51:48] yellowtristan: it’ll take a while but cops will get better at chasing with practice, not everyone can be like Suarez and bones
[3:51:51] Virtux_: Baas would've chased them with a helicopter through the tunnels SeemsGood
[3:51:52] repivv: These chases have been sick.  Almost got some huge ones, but that'll only make the catch eventually be better
[3:51:53] Firsthandpower: It's been great 👍 plus seeing all the cops joining together is fun to watch
[3:51:55] Abdoullah21: 3.0 Saab would’ve caught them
[3:51:56] Guielme: @kevol33t doesnt matter if bikes are fast or not since you cant pit it, you just go for one of the 999 bike strats and insta lose cops
[3:51:56] AddyAdam: the whole breaking the cuffs mini game needs to be harder, breaking it 4 times with 4 cops on scene is silly lol
[3:52:17] YEP46: Oldge my stripper washed
[3:52:24] repivv: Eh cuffs are fine pd has the advantage anyway
[3:52:27] srejok: thatd be cool the more cops on scene the harder it is to break em
[3:52:34] repivv: It kind of sucks to watch tho
[3:52:36] Artsii1994: LookUp
[3:52:40] Virtux_: @AddyAdam It gets harder for each break, most people don't manage to break the 3rd. It's just that some crims have insane reaction
[3:52:50] kevol33t: @guielme then there should be bike units like the cars that simple it not crims problem
[3:52:51] jersey_jesus: Waterlogged Sadge
[3:52:53] Hudson_Pain: It's RP folks, also remember if they do catch someone = an hour of paper work and MDT RP
[3:53:01] hopalong92: Them breaking cuffs makes it better though
[3:53:01] ItsBillz: i think tasers are super strong to counter cuffs being easy
[3:53:03] iiamrenegade: do cuffs get harder to break the more times you break them?
[3:53:04] bindwounds: Cops need faster car's to :( alot faster , and more bikes
[3:53:08] m1tchole: That interaction with K was hilarious
[3:53:10] GearGrinder259: I walked away for two seconds and came back to paragraphs in chat..
[3:53:13] bcbray: today's chases have been great on the PD side, regardless of how many got caught
[3:53:24] jamieddd: cuffs they auto cuff after 3-4 try too?
[3:53:25] FizzDidThis: PeepoComfy
[3:53:25] Guielme: its not about catching but as a viewer it gets repetitive the 6 cuffs in a row and swap
[3:53:28] nox503: mehdiCOZY
[3:53:31] realpossible: bike units and tbh i think the crim to cop ratio is a pretty big difference right now
[3:53:31] rubberbreaker: Chat you have to remember it high risk for the criminals too it makes it a good chase for pd and room to improve
[3:53:31] Buffalohed: or better drivers
[3:53:35] DanLGG: It’s the hard balance to find the happy medium. The server is very young
[3:53:36] Navigator_Nav: PD doing great!
[3:53:38] Kevz95: @jamieddd 4th try I believe
[3:53:43] just_james69: I just think if you've been tazed you shouldn't be able to break cuffs but it lead to fun RP so who cares
[3:53:46] Firsthandpower: PD has been locked in
[3:53:46] arcswo: Its better for role play if the PD doesnt catch everyone.
[3:53:50] MisterParry: It's GTA, if the cops stopped every crime this wouldn't be fun. A lot of crims are supposed to get away Shrug
[3:53:53] GearGrinder259: Yeah I agree with that. Rule of 6 is too high atm
[3:54:02] Hudson_Pain: The newer cops will get better at driving
[3:54:10] Kevz95: not enough cops to deal with rule of 6 atm

[3:55:09] Guielme: @kevol33t thats true but very hard to manage, if they know the possibilite of a bike swap and have a cop bike ready its fine, if they dont theres not enought time
[3:55:10] arcswo: Today has been a really good mix of PD wins and Crim wins with these chases
[3:55:11] GearGrinder259: @GearGrinder259 Fuck it. 3.5 people Grab a half a dude lol
[3:55:13] Alexqc19: Rules of 4 was the best ngl

[3:55:34] wavep987: 4.0 is great, but one thing I wish came back is the rule of 4. Situations are over quickly, and cops don't burnout.
[3:55:36] ItsBillz: i prefer rule of 4 with cop limits per scene but that wont happen
[3:55:38] Velatile: @Guielme cop bike is too slow, even if they have one the civs can simply out run it

[3:55:55] bluoxxboi: Splatter treatment is crazy
[3:56:00] viewgalaxy: Chatty the boy
[3:56:05] lookingfornothinghere: the problem with rule of 6 is that its multiple group of 6 and the strats used PD need almost double the numbers to catch people
[3:56:16] Alexqc19: Rules of 6 should be a thing for certain crime imo
[3:56:17] dezalbos: @floss10time DankChat

[3:56:44] AddyAdam: whats rule 6?
[3:56:48] jersey_jesus: I thought the rule of 5 on Prodigy was a good middle ground.
[3:56:49] arcswo: What does rule 6 mean?
[3:56:51] Guielme: @Alexqc19 Do the rule apply for swaps to? like 4 in the chase and 3 more around doing swaps
[3:56:53] iiamrenegade: whats the fun house
[3:56:54] ItsBillz: yeah no car has more than 4 seats
[3:56:55] lizardeyes: things
[3:56:56] m1tchole: Give PD oppressor mark 2's but they're only allowed to pit with them nothing else saabStare
[3:56:56] lookingfornothinghere: rule of 6 is only bad because of the amount of cars that get involved sadly

[3:57:24] DanLGG: 4 isn’t enough 5 is odd
[3:57:26] srejok: its crazy watching the locals try to hit you almost every other one
[3:57:31] bot_bubbs: @m1tchole Giving the PD missiles is based.
[3:57:34] InvictoNZ: lets just recruit more cops
[3:57:35] Beragal: They couldn't reduce to 4 until PD rebuilt?
[3:57:35] jordan_gaming13: they just do jobs as 2 people with 4 people with vehicle swaps lol
[3:57:36] m1tchole: Dw only 3 more years until gta 6 rp
[3:57:38] Drkdream: rule of 6 might work once the PD get more stuff like Air1
[3:57:39] HeyMeghan: are they allowed to add additional people after they did the crime?
