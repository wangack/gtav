[7:30:07] DRaco1503: How do we know what u did offstream
[7:30:08] KushKowboy6: Okay okay that kinda makes sense because you have zaza set to a specific turf
[7:30:08] Hezi9s: @Lysium so Zaza locked to cypress and you need either reggie or Anita here?
[7:30:08] LeonardoGolden: WE ARE ALL COOKED ADHD

[7:30:11] Nicolasamw: call seller #2
[7:30:12] tidyee: Imagine rob lang and sell his weed here
[7:30:13] blazerox: u have to test if selling zaza on cypress drops their rep
[7:30:13] Skillah10s: seller 2 needs only reggie .. not zaza
[7:30:13] iniblu: Yes it is
[7:30:14] jepoy314: we might not remember if off strea
[7:30:15] certifiedbyaor: selling reggie doesn‚Äôt affect anything just your seller rep goes up, I think
[7:30:16] DoubleDs85: Yes so that means you sell zaza at cyperus to tank his rep!
[7:30:16] 0utatime_: @lysium if u get hands on langs Weed sellon other turf to grief them EX
[7:30:18] mandyg69: maybe because the other guys sold it as reggie?

[7:30:26] sonny211: your wrong I think cause it continued to go down during the day when you weren't selling it
[7:30:26] chechlto1: you can probably rob scooby dooby and fuck their rep @Lysium
[7:30:27] GordonFreebase: its probably bugged where selling zaza here, registers as anita which would lower zaza
[7:30:28] RiftingFlotsam: So ZAZA has to stay on the shared turf?
[7:30:30] MAB09x: How did it reach the initial 50% anyway? Was it seller2 ?
[7:30:32] sonzasin: u cant sell zaza here

[7:32:19] achillesjay1: whats the bank account looking like?
[7:32:19] probationed: @imacableguy I think (no basis for thoughts) the contacts help speed up your sales, and then hold on to your extra weed and rolled bills so you can sell more yourself
[7:32:19] prayge_: Get 3 people selling and its done
[7:32:20] eXCeleNTT: wonder how much u'd sell if you pay for all 3 of the guys from app

[7:32:28] redcucuy_711: Wasn't there 2 strains of zaza?
[7:32:30] ForceBan: Its probably because you have two turfs and the overall percentage went down
[7:32:38] ninecastles: PepeLaugh
[7:32:39] hapigilmore: Dex steals door knobs, weed???????
