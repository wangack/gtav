[4:48:14] IchibaToll: Who?
[4:48:15] VTMonster: He's fine
[4:48:16] A_Humble_Wooper: I haven't watched enough of him to have any vibes yet. So... neutral?
[4:48:18] LilMaGooby: The texts today really helped
[4:48:22] KarnEvil: he seems alright
[4:48:23] AshuraX13: I've only watched him here.
[4:48:24] laxwall11: havent seen him outside of that one run
[4:48:26] teacupcryptids: A bit on the serious side but I like him
[4:48:27] willowfennec: Hank could really be an asset
[4:48:28] abblepiewit: Hoping he's turned the corner on Maxx and will be more friendly now.
[4:48:31] doc_sharon: I'd like to see how he does on like a run katesHm
[4:48:38] Siirika: katesShrug The Lumber run stuff was a little wierd, but the texts kinda fine?
[4:48:43] stormscenes: i like him too, he’s very smart and driven
[4:48:50] spazzles: Hank vibes:  I like the guy but he's an odd duck.  I literally never know what to expect from him
[4:48:52] stormscenes: and can count on him for inf o
[4:48:58] LilMaGooby: He wasn't passing the vibe check before the texts
[4:49:08] mister_nibbles: i watch a ton of tom and wally during degen and i barely know hank, so not sure tbh
[4:49:32] laxwall11: I do wonder if he is going to be a team player cuz he seems to like to do his own stuff
[4:49:48] doc_sharon: Is Hank looking to be a crime guy or a clean guy? katesHm
[4:49:52] mister_nibbles: wally and tom really fricced the curve lol
[4:50:04] Siirika: Yesyes Wally and Tom just vibed with everyone, and just wanted to hang regardless
[4:50:06] laxwall11: like I think he would like the resources of the club but idk if he is willing to do stuff for the club
[4:50:31] Hoocairz: He can be preoccupied with his own stuff it seems, but he's also not attached to the club so that might be where that comes into play. He's personable 1 on 1. He's also got big ears.
[4:50:46] AshuraX13: We're Grime Gang Yesyes
[4:51:00] doc_sharon: true NODDERS
[4:51:10] Hoocairz: I mean he hears a lot
[4:51:53] Siirika: So like hangy's would just be vibe check and showing interest then yeah?
[4:51:57] Hoocairz: I got that from how you read it lol. I don't want to meta too much on it.
[4:52:23] laxwall11: yeah like will he be full on for the club idk
[4:52:32] AshuraX13: Yeah, he would have to start doing the things the club needs
[4:53:01] IchibaToll: Yeah, I would expect people to get more like Tom and Wally as they get closer to the club.  They need to want to be part of the club, and that should shine through at some point.
[4:53:34] doc_sharon: duDudu
[4:53:41] LilMaGooby: Hank seems like a self driven and independent person
[4:54:01] Nightbot: Follow Kate on Instagram! instagram.com/kate.ttv
[4:54:02] laxwall11: I mean does he?
[4:54:12] laxwall11: idk what his MC rules were
[4:54:51] LilMaGooby: Not every member will give a majority of their money
[4:55:35] laxwall11: I think Hank will end up a good friend of the club put thats it, just my guess
[4:56:13] JovanMaxis: Big "owning a home? in this economy?" energy and frankly, fair.
[4:56:59] IchibaToll: Joining The Raiders should be more of a lifestyle choice, not a hobby, IMO.  That's not to suggest Hank or anyone else treats it like a side gig - just a perspective on how some might view it.
[4:57:36] doc_sharon: back into the duDudu
[4:57:46] stormscenes: i do agree ichiba

[5:34:33] BearClawPhD: kates7
[5:34:38] doc_sharon: on low volume, unmuted, so it counts NODDERS
[5:34:40] nikki_0318: I got you! I can do that no problem!
[5:34:46] AshuraX13: Even if I have to dip to do errands, I leave the window open while I am gone
[5:34:55] Ms_LadyMix: I'll do a 1% volume stream often
[5:34:56] spazzles: I very often do that when I have to run errands
[5:34:59] Insaif: I have about a dozen of my regularly watched streams that I leave in tabs all the time.
[5:35:03] lorddracnor: I usually do when I'd doing other things
[5:35:04] theIngrid21: i left it playing while i went to do errands lol
[5:35:10] spazzles: Ms_LadyMix exactly, I do that all the time
[5:35:17] MaxxEMoose: LUL dodo
[5:35:30] Pleasantmsp: I do that whenever I can NODDERS It's even easier to do with 2 monitors EZ
[5:35:34] Ms_LadyMix: I've thought about messing with my computer mute button to have it set volumes at 1% instead of fully muted lol
[5:35:46] FunkFoo: katesLurk  RISE!! and keep LURKING!!
[5:36:08] KayCash_Money: lol I have you in my pocket while working at the hospital:) happy to support
[5:36:28] Hoocairz: Yep, it works, but you need to have the sound on super low, and it's limited to watching a certain number of streams. Also, make sure the tabs aren't going to sleep (though with sound on they shouldn't) katesL katesL
[5:37:10] Nightbot: I'm a Logitech G Partner! Go to https://logi.gg/Kate and use code KATE10 at checkout for 10% off all Logitech, Logitech G and Astro products!
[5:37:12] Pleasantmsp: @KayCash_Money I do that all the time when I'm at work too
[5:37:34] AshuraX13: Yeah, a muted stream doesn't count as a view
[5:37:35] doc_sharon: yeah, unmuted to count as a view NODDERS
[5:37:39] BryceRoyal: I usually have 5 or 6 stream tabs open at minimum with the tab muted rather than the stream muted.
[5:37:46] A_Humble_Wooper: I just mute the tab, rather than the stream. I don't think twitch can see that?
[5:37:53] MaxxEMoose: @Hoocairz with the knowledge bombs katesFlower
[5:38:02] Pleasantmsp: yeah, so you leave it at 1% NODDERS
[5:38:10] Insaif: Yeah, if you mute the TAB, but not the stream, it will still count. That way you don't have to have a bunch of extra audio.
[5:38:12] inpeep: annoyingly, twitch will turn your volume up for ads when its down low.
[5:38:14] doc_sharon: WeSmart chat knows the strats
[5:38:34] BearClawPhD: Chat... you smart
[5:38:38] Insaif: You might need to get a separate extension to mute the tab, but it works.
[5:38:40] DirectorStephanie: Chat's so smart.

[5:38:57] ElectronicChaos: Put the caca squeeze to the test
[5:39:04] BryceRoyal: Muted tabs is how I had like 28,000 hours watched on Twitch last year.
[5:39:10] Kthanid: Maybe some roofies for chase?
[5:39:26] doc_sharon: katesBless
[5:39:30] A_Humble_Wooper: @Insaif I use firefox and I haven't needed to get a plugin. I just mouse over the tab at the top of the window and click the sound icon next to the title.
[5:39:36] lorddracnor: I want to hear Edbert and Tom argue because they sound the same.
[5:39:49] AshuraX13: It really is. I'm loving it katesSnuggle
[5:39:54] AshuraX13: There is a clip of it
[5:39:57] Insaif: @A_Humble_Wooper Chrome need a separate extension for it, but yeah, that works.

[5:41:27] OutlandAsh: yes they are so good
[5:41:30] val_pyre: is a panda cookie different from hello panda?
[5:41:38] lorddracnor: are they made out of real pandas?
[5:41:46] val_pyre: i just ate some teehee
[5:41:47] Jinakadaisy: oh yes, i grew up on those haha
[5:42:01] 4taog: we get the chocolate ones because the kid is allergic to artificial strawberry
[5:42:04] MyNameisTiff_: Oh! I know those. They're yummy.
[5:42:10] lorddracnor: wha?! that sounds awesome!
[5:42:11] willowfennec: I prefer the choco ones but the strawberry are good too
[5:42:14] FunkFoo: @val_pyre Yes the Hello Panda
[5:42:26] Cordilia: I run the streams I lurk in on a different browser so I can have the sound sent to a different audio output
[5:42:31] val_pyre: thank you funk : )
[5:43:06] Hoocairz: I'm not sure if it still matters, but also if you're part of a raid, clicking the raid target's account helps with higher view counts, too. Have a friend that has a raid thank you announcement that redirects to thier page because of that. At one point the peak viewers wasn't matching what she saw during raids.
[5:43:37] MaxxEMoose: like how first-person crawl was hella fast, same mechanic
[5:44:04] hecktobreakfast: Yeah. Have to click through on a raid or it doesn't really do a whole lot.
[5:44:13] Nightbot: Follow Kate on Twitter! twitter.com/katestark

[6:06:35] Pleasantmsp: I did however roll a nat 20 critroleSuccess first roll of the day so katesCheer
[6:06:52] tyrelrahl: For I look at the size rolls as spoons.  Out of 12 is how many spoons, out of 6 is how much the spoons can hold, and because I think it's funny out of 3 is still ball size lol
[6:07:05] Insaif: @A_Humble_Wooper I am not.

[6:12:31] Insaif: Sounds like you definitely need a lot of people pushing the same strain.

[6:13:50] stormscenes: ya ya
[6:14:06] if0rg0t2remember: especially since the strained weed gets so much more rep it can be done much faster
[6:14:07] Nightbot: Follow Kate on Instagram! instagram.com/kate.ttv
[6:14:10] Insaif: With the strain weed, it sounds like you have to push the low levels a lot less than before.
