[5:37:05] Queen_Tor: ^
[5:37:07] zephyrec: SameGame yea
[5:37:09] maryzelly: Same Game, click a section of same-colored squares to remove them. Doing this will move the blocks below and to the side, if you clear a column, so it’s important to think about some moves before making them. It’s often better to start from the bottom so you don’t alter the blocks too much.
[5:37:10] xbrynnplays: match 2 or more squares until there are no more squares
[5:37:13] K_Champion: Yeah toon blast looks the most similar
[5:37:18] Fabian4477: if you have only 3 red blocks and one blue block left you have to end on the 3 red blocks
[5:37:33] forgettablehuman: NO not toon blast
