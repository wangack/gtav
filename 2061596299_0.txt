[1:32:11] Gachiguru: @watchmeragequit nope
[1:32:14] mrphoenix10: i really miss the 3.0 music scene

[1:34:02] 1CaptainRedBeard1: PD needs a punishment system of some sort. Put there also needs to be classes and shit to prove you've "reformed" from your shit behaviour.

[1:35:38] EddieMakes: @Enoobrac 60days in RP is a fking eternity too, crazy punishment
[1:35:42] merrilljustice: @gobo6 dean paid for the stuff. he just needs to get his rep up to get any profit from it. that's why he's grinding now
[1:35:47] slight621: @Enoobrac They need comprehensive system that includes training, reform, and the ability to partially work them off
[1:35:49] honbry: love the new hair Dean, when did you join the quakers?
[1:35:50] 1CaptainRedBeard1: @Enoobrac Exactly. 60 days is nutty. If you want to have it be that long you got to have classes where people can "reform" and learn. Gives an opportunity to RP (content) and prove you've changed.

[1:36:28] EddieMakes: needs something like that Tessa drivign school, where they RP the training etc
[1:36:28] Athasin: @EddieMakes What sucks the most is he was 14 days from having 4 fall off
[1:36:32] merrilljustice: @eddiemakes sixty days?!! is that what he got?? oh hell nah
[1:36:32] DanLGG: was anyone watching cop last night?
[1:36:45] Enoobrac: @Enoobrac yup just like @slight621 said, theres gotta be a system in place that lets you "reform" it would open up some good cop RP too

[1:38:10] quaylewastaken: You ever play Super Collapse it's just like that

[1:39:05] Gachiguru: I was thinking that cops have precincts and that would be the cops version of gangs that way cops who want to be together can be together, all the precincts work together through high command channels but discipline can be dealt within the precinct
[1:39:19] koolcoach: shhhhhh

[3:30:46] 2hopp: @Troytd yea bro dont snitch
[3:30:46] DezalbM: this gang really needed you they were floundering hard before you came back
[3:30:49] getanime: DEN was alot of pressure lately
[3:30:50] swwwamp: @Kelborn facts
[3:30:55] Floo94: Its just Ruth
[3:30:57] Money2Much: no ooc stress u get from playing cop much more nicer time
[3:30:58] BDG_parth28: WWW 2 months
[3:30:58] improvisablex: so all the time?
[3:30:58] jessicalou: cop is just you writing reports 75% of the time
[3:31:01] BrainDeadTheMain: i mean you doing crim atleast you can understand some of the crim stress when it comes to making money
[3:31:09] getanime: That DAP thing is so shit
[3:31:09] marneraiders: Less Paperwork
[3:31:10] EmDuBB13: the dap system has to be changed or completely gone
[3:31:17] captain_steve_420: Denzel as a civ would be such good content tho. Especially after Cornwood gets fired today
[3:31:18] Athasin: Once you back on Denzel you really need to figure out who the opps are because it's crazy
[3:31:19] russellhmar: Dear Denzel Shiesty, so this is how the procedure works...... LUL LUL
[3:31:20] Mandrenn: way less reports!
[3:31:31] Money2Much: @captain_steve_420 hes not who said that
[3:31:34] brikbeans: Cop rp seems fun as hell, but this is a cool switch up
[3:31:42] DanLGG: Did maple get dapped or suspended last night?
[3:31:44] monkeyastronaut25: this low tier crim stuff. it gets more stressful later for weapons and stuff
[3:31:57] captain_steve_420: @Money2Much just wait Kappa
[3:32:03] Zanduin: @DanLGG He got warned
[3:32:03] Sacredtenshi: I miss the PD content, but this is okay
[3:32:07] Adams2303: u dying
[3:32:16] zero00356: Respect the elderly
[3:32:16] sharrkuu: as if crim isn't bad enough they make you wait
[3:32:18] MDM4ever1986HD: @EmDuBB13 but I'm going to compare it to real life if the cop was chasing a criminal and the cop ran over a kid, who do they blame? the cop or the crim?#
[3:32:25] 2hopp: wait till u sell g6 rolls takes like 3 hours to sell a trucks worth of rolls
[3:32:35] MDM4ever1986HD: they would say the cop right?
[3:32:41] Gachiguru: how tf is crim that bad LULW shits so easy you got the whole server on your side vs pd
[3:32:49] m4l1kkk: He wants to split 315 😭
[3:32:51] EmDuBB13: @MDM4ever1986HD sure i agree they need consequences completely, but i think it needs a rework
[3:33:09] MDM4ever1986HD: @EmDuBB13 true that
[3:33:10] brikbeans: 157 run his pockets
[3:33:15] improvisablex: Crim talk is Pepega
[3:33:25] DanLGG: @zanduin Warned?? I’m assuming he didn’t press the charge but he still disobeyed chain of command and SOP
[3:33:41] Zunnun: Even tho 49ers lost a couple of days ago i just wanted to say take that L deansoP
[3:33:48] chapoop_: who is dean rollin wit?

[3:34:20] MakiWind: Are you gonna do a course report writing to get  some daps away
[3:34:24] Zunnun: @poketova nopixel it's a rp server
[3:34:27] Superhank: AINTNOWAY dean doing sani
[3:34:27] LazyMike: G6 much easier LUL
[3:34:27] m4l1kkk: Civ Gang deansoPa
[3:34:41] 2hopp: being a civilian is way easier
[3:34:42] Zunnun: !besties
[3:34:42] Fossabot: https://clips.twitch.tv/TenuousHappyBibimbapNinjaGrumpy-nftpp0cr9wX8HdRV
[3:34:45] gijn: over 10k hour clean
[3:34:47] ramsin50: shouldn't crime pay better than civ since it's more risky
[3:34:53] thricerice1: G6 dead
[3:34:54] aizen142: at least now you know why people hate g6 runners LUL
[3:35:00] poketova: @zunnun oh, yeah I see it's RP. Thanks <3
[3:35:00] Zanduin: Maple just being dumb, dont worry about it
[3:35:04] Gachiguru: crime is gonna pay way more then civ at the end
[3:35:06] Athasin: @ramsin50 No cause crime doesn't pay
[3:35:08] swwwamp: @ramsin50 then everyone would do crime and no one would do civ
[3:35:20] Zunnun: @poketova no worries deansoHeart2
[3:35:23] Kelborn: @MDM4ever1986HD really good point I never though about. IRL if that happens, the fleeing criminal is charged. The cop was acting within the scope of his duties during the chase.
[3:35:30] khlaah: Crim is a grind, it's gotta be a grind otherwise it'd be super super OP
[3:35:32] Zanduin: @ramsin50 There has to be a tradeoff
[3:35:35] Athasin: @ramsin50 No but seriously it's because of 3.0, in 3.0 it was cops and crims, civs barely existed
[3:35:41] MakiWind: do group6
[3:35:44] harveyelliot17: karma for treating dougles wrong.
[3:35:45] piedpiper000: what the hell is that hair???
[3:35:47] spawndead123: crime is a progression its not direct money maker bcuz if that happen all civ will just become crim
[3:35:57] bobdang07hd: Down bad, arguing over $315
[3:35:59] Athasin: @ramsin50 So they balanced the server by making civs a viable option because they know people are gonna do crim regardless
[3:36:05] spawndead123: this is what dev wanted to do if u want to make crim money then earn it
[3:36:07] espeiranza: dog ?
[3:36:08] LazyMike: nice guy
[3:36:14] Superhank: crim shouldnt pay until they're on much higher levels
[3:36:18] ramsin50: in real life the only reason people do crime is because it's fast money
[3:36:27] khlaah: Personally, if I could play (job takes too much time) I'd just grind Weed
[3:36:27] spawndead123: @Superhank  true
[3:36:30] Beafour: Crime is better RP for both crims and cops
[3:36:39] improvisablex: @khlaah weed pays nothin
[3:36:44] 2hopp: but all they accomplished is make crims into civs lol
[3:36:48] khlaah: maybe HVAC too
[3:36:55] LazyMike: KEKW
[3:36:56] RebornOffline: I'd do anything except crim KEKW
[3:36:56] spawndead123: dont want to spoil but Lang already told his viewer what is the reward for higher risk heist
[3:36:59] Nsan7: Pog oh?
[3:37:00] ramsin50: maybe it's like this because there aren't enough cops
[3:37:02] swwwamp: i heard pd is hiring
[3:37:04] LuDiaJoe: Pointless den zel
[3:37:05] cirocski: EMS would be cool
[3:37:08] m4l1kkk: EMS with the besties ✨💓
[3:37:09] d_o_g_o_: thay would actually be good
[3:37:10] Zanduin: Server wouldnt be GTA RP without Cops, Crims, and Civs. just let em play
[3:37:11] DjSprayK: Do you have a record on Dean yet?
[3:37:11] Athasin: @khlaah And you'd be broke because you have no clean money
[3:37:15] DanLGG: bro ems and doctors prolly make hella money
[3:37:17] captain_steve_420: Denzel aint getting his job back if Dean dont play him on civ
[3:37:18] espeiranza: did he play chiesty civ or not ?
[3:37:23] khlaah: shit
[3:37:42] harveyelliot17: does this mean now that he knows all about money orders??

[3:38:31] Fabushki: that car electric?
[3:38:34] st9736: fire dept would be cool if random fires spawn and you get paid for each call
[3:38:41] 2hopp: 4head is missing a step

[3:38:44] DjSprayK: @Fabushki yea
[3:38:45] LazyMike: the guy LUL
[3:38:51] improvisablex: more work than PD KEKW
[3:38:52] koolcoach: The vibes are so positive as a Civ being able to talk and hang out with everyone
[3:39:00] MDM4ever1986HD: PD has got pros and cons PROS you get to arrest the crims, pit them etc and con you're on very thin thread if you disrespect your duties etc
[3:39:04] Athasin: @Deansocool He's showing you the process so you can do it when he's not awake
[3:39:04] captain_steve_420: crim is boring like 95% of the time
[3:39:09] chmod_R_777: second day on crim, only doing crime... no police interaction at all... LSPD, what a joke
