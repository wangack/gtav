[2:58:06] ProletariatEgg: You usually plant southern facing. carShrug Just from my experience. You want your plants with as much southern exposure as you can get.
[2:58:34] SirYogiWan: I'm thinking where the sunflowers are looks like rich soil, the plants are bigger naturally and that means more suited
[2:58:58] zenyatta: @hrafnagut i mean theres a chance he could just be realizing his fan base is younger and tends to be more progressive and so he's just following the wind but i hope you're right

[4:19:56] StarGazer2o2: @hamter_raptor I recommend using the farmers almanac, gives you the right sun and moon phases to plant lol
[4:20:14] Chartreux1: surrounding growth affect it?
[4:20:56] c0rry5: theres always an exception
[4:21:06] StarGazer2o2: I think soil exhaustion is pretty substantial as a theory at this point
[4:21:24] c0rry5: *Starts growing weed in WoW*
[4:21:25] Neisza: what about the color of the soil sometimes its like yellowish or green ect
[4:21:47] Wyllas: does it grow at night
[4:21:56] Imprisoned_Fetus: idk if the farmer's almanac is gonna have info on weed plants
[4:21:59] Oatmealyeti_: its like growing folklore lol moon phases dont do anything but germination temps sure matter a lot more in my experience
[4:22:13] hamter_raptor: HmmNotes not wrong StarGazer2o2 what about a draught, as well ...  (noon is classically known as the worst time to water plants, so i took it a step further with plant times)
[4:22:20] GumpBrave: that would also allow for substantial replenishment of the soil, which could possibly confound theories

[7:42:34] Th3H3rmit: @Dvicious012 To be fair the GWB I feel like he was set up for that war. Maybe his dad maybe the alphabets maybe mosad who knows but personally i think GWB wasn't the guilty party there.
