[0:39:26] MrByte: My HOA isn't that bad. They're super lenient, they exist mostly to take care of the public spaces.
[0:39:28] Dire_Squid: I'm gonna move next to somewhere with an HOA and start up a gang that stealth-plants wildflowers in everyone's lawns overnight

[4:16:47] NickPenrhyn: Phoneguying classic
[4:17:01] Suleman_aftab: Luciano seem interested too
[4:17:14] Battenhall: @Livesies VU NPC is not a guaranteed 5% rate, it is 5% only at the best rate
[4:17:17] DarthRadonis: Its smart for Luciano and Harry to get their rep up

[4:18:24] Battenhall: @edison2000 staree it is not
[4:18:30] da1true1: have you seen harry's and luci's still site yet?
[4:18:35] SailorWS: Oshiball its 5% at max rep
[4:18:42] ZachDGames: VU is absolutely worth it imo nodd
[4:18:50] Livesies: @Livesies Right, high rep with volumes to get the washing done faster and eliminate that bottleneck
[4:18:53] NickPenrhyn: 40% Gloryon said iirc
[4:18:55] DarthRadonis: and she gives back washed cash that needs to be ran thru the banks
[4:18:55] hypnomaze: its not even clean money its washed with VU isnt it?

[4:19:40] edison2000: Yeah idk, fanny has been using the vu since day1 with the money guy and she always had 5%, even when she had 0 rep with vu
[4:19:41] called_me_sona: i mean the more ppl have rep from VU is the better right
[4:19:59] called_me_sona: cs if u and lang do it u prob can wash 40k/ 2 hour
[4:20:04] xscoxevox: How much we betting the washer are empty?
[4:20:11] xscoxevox: Lol
[4:20:13] Inox75: can't you get the big washers?
[4:20:14] Suleman_aftab: 2 people doing VU would be good
[4:20:24] SailorWS: washers are not 100% return due to power bills
[4:20:26] DarthRadonis: Big washers are Just Cosmetic
[4:20:46] Sl33pyJinn: there is like 80k of washed cash waiting to be cleaned
