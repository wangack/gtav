[2:22:23] TheBadkins: Hmmm
[2:22:32] DoingBusiness: cops gotta do the paperwork for sure
[2:22:40] OneOfManyMikes: Do dispatchers have the ability to answer 911 calls as it stands right now?
[2:23:05] Ohiosveryown: OneOfManyMikes they are the ones who will pick up yes
[2:23:57] rick_stevenson5: And 311s or are they one and the same
[2:23:59] TheBadkins: whats a 10-54? Susge
[2:24:00] Ohiosveryown: And they create cards for the PD outside of Car thefts, the "citizens" do that by calling in
[2:24:00] rest87: Could making dispatch an actuall paid job? Like the resturants etc, perhaps that gives some longevity? If a cop/competant person starts it /hires ppl
[2:24:15] BadHabitss: mobile dispatch nodd

[2:24:40] SomeRandomer: satelite truck
[2:24:51] Ohiosveryown: Dispatch should potentially be (eventually) a stream lined past the cadet program. So yes you do dispatch but like you said also be with ftos if possible.
[2:25:18] exoosia: pager?
[2:25:24] Crandom: making dispatch enjoyable over a long period of time seem like a hard nut to crack Hmmm
[2:25:26] Sykum: that is a good idea
[2:25:28] Rim0: hard to dispatch when you're in a car with a cop who's in a chase doing comms for an example
[2:25:40] exoosia: @Rim0 skill issue EZ
[2:26:15] Ohiosveryown: Rim0 yea true, but like there can only be 4 dispatch on per shift, if ur out of shift and there is a fto aveliable let a dispatch ride with them?
[2:26:16] Kold87: dispatch should be separate from pd imo
[2:26:20] McGullik: use them as DOC aswell?
[2:26:36] DoingBusiness: letting dispatch edit reports would be a disaster, cops just need to do that shit
[2:27:08] joe_saturday: HR reports: 4 HRNI points for locker room talk KEKW
[2:27:25] Rim0: i don't mean like hard or anything just, if they're doing comms and dispatch is trying to answer 911 call. They would be talking over each other.

[2:28:55] tangobish: having them down at zonah seems a good idea theres always like 20 ppl there
