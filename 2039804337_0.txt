[3:02:33] Skyvernius: with Stephanie
[3:02:40] chefx2000: He pretty much runs the show. Vince was put on just a business side by the new owners
[3:02:46] Deadmund: rey mysterio and john cena was my favorites xD
[3:02:47] KingCanadaHill: Bret "hitman" Hart
[3:02:48] phoenixvt_owo: He took over for Vince McMahon he basically is doing like the main running of the shows and all that his main thing is NTX

[3:02:53] TheRadiantDevil: wrestling is basically anime
[3:02:57] Adorate_Luna: No one's ever gonna get a Wrestlemania Streak as long as Taker's
[3:03:00] TheeForsakenOne: Stephanie quit WWE months ago.

[3:04:24] puptime: ChefFrank softPog brioPat phillieBless raysLove
[3:04:31] chefx2000: I'll say it. Steph and HHH could have kept the company in the family. Vince wanted control and it was a dick move of him to sell the company just so he could still be "in charge". Even though the new owners basically told him HHH is running the show now.

[4:34:10] SchlafNinja: Dumb dog can do silly things. Ops i ate a abay teehee
[4:34:14] Salimufari: a dog has some immunities & is also pretty lethal when attacking
[4:34:16] KashimTenshi: Yeah you have to be trained. Other stuff its just like "Yep. Im doing my JOB"
[4:34:17] CrabsoluteTrash: It's also VERY easy to metagame if you're a k9 and have another character. You're a fly on the wall
[4:34:18] BiiBiku: @miketwng adoreOwO
[4:34:18] Archaius: except wrangler

[4:34:30] composite_gg: thankfully you are
[4:34:34] Salimufari: How many of those attacks did it take for you to drop Scanlin?
[4:34:40] PvrplxAce49: you react as if you are a dog, but you did hella impressive job
[4:34:43] Kabra_Men: exept wrangler, he can understand
[4:34:43] a_ghostlegend: so you can go willy nilly and attack becuase someone calls you stupid
[4:34:44] Batsie07: dogs can learn 200 words
[4:34:48] a_ghostlegend: cant*
[4:34:53] sergeantgrimes: I could definitely put myself in my dogs mind. sleep, eat, and shit
[4:34:53] baconbabies34: You need a little paw patty dance
[4:34:56] M1ST3RM1ND: Can you 1-shot people with a heavy attack?
[4:34:58] KashimTenshi: If you wanna use text rp, its so much fun. *Pees on tree* and such
[4:34:58] PrimordialCosmicHorror: VRChat mutes have a way in to GTARP!
[4:34:58] sallysuebear: And she will learn words over time
[4:35:02] a_ghostlegend: understandable
[4:35:02] tan284: also your actions as a police dog could affect any other police dogs, could get the program shut down if things go wrong
[4:35:03] miketwng: it's harder to rp is what your saying
[4:35:04] Moosecow1: Clap
[4:35:06] Reborn_Lord: you are getting a lot of information you can't use for sure. Especially with the sniffing/searching it is good to be mindful of that.

[4:51:19] txcowboy9: I guess you're going on patrol for the first time instead of taking you back to the PD
[4:51:21] Salimufari: IT would be a rare RP opportunity given what you said about the power a dog has in this world
[4:51:21] omen_nevermore: K9 RP is always fun to watch stripCute
[4:51:22] txcowboy9: Lol

[4:55:02] CrazyKaya18TheGremlin: Hewooo
[4:55:05] GreenToebean: I wonder if therapy/support animals and service animals would be viable RP options?
[4:55:07] Adorate_Luna: What about potentially hostile wildlife? Would also help with the Game Wardens
[4:55:13] Dutch_Tuchd: One of the Admin already played as a deer and carried someone up a hill while surrounded by cops. shit was funny AF
[4:55:14] Tear223: jumping, running, sniffing
[4:55:48] Batsie07: collar or vest would be great
[4:55:55] Archaius: would be cool if you could go below the truck but that would be a lot of work for smth niche
[4:56:00] Dizastronaught: Do u have Heightened detection abilities
[4:56:09] griphen677: gotta get a stick for the doggos lol
[4:56:16] jexpyy: do we put in a ticket about wanting to play a animal?
[4:56:22] MissJessMJM: Not having to go to the back to open the trunk everytime would be nice, like maybe a button that opens it remotely would be nice
[4:56:25] Dizastronaught: and high speed running?
[4:56:39] CrazyKaya18TheGremlin: Lol
[4:56:40] hysteria303: what about a falconry hawk?
[4:57:01] JornNightmane: Heh, I remember the times of gta fun as a cat, the moment you get out the car, you just *flop* hemooxDead as a cat XD

[4:58:20] Ambi_Trigger: adoreLore
[4:58:32] HandsoftheStringPuller: If a dog gets hurt does it go to the hospital?
[4:58:51] Azureburn: @HandsoftheStringPuller I've seen some vet stuff around the place, maybe there?
[4:58:54] baconbabies34: @handsofthestringpuller goes to a vet lol
[4:58:54] cerendipidi: there is a vet
[4:59:38] SchlafNinja: very bad no
[5:00:17] txcowboy9: Plots is sits in most k9s I believe
[5:00:20] krenlash42: or a stick
[5:00:40] PvrplxAce49: but if its a stick i don wanna let go
[5:01:09] txcowboy9: Ya that makes sense
[5:01:52] txcowboy9: So another thing that you may want to look into is having the action of opening the trunk yourself for like a door pop
[5:02:12] Grothmar9: @joaquin17084, english only please
[5:02:19] joaquin17084: jajajajaja
[5:02:20] joaquin17084: a
[5:02:32] Siebzhen: I wanted to say I absolutly loved how you interacted with the Crow at the hospital a stream or so back.
[5:02:36] Dizastronaught: so its a combo of English for "off duty" & German for "on duty" kinda almost
[5:02:37] krenlash42: very thorough of you momo
[5:02:44] simbaka45: Bark to scare the perps
[5:02:48] btkcurly: adoreThumbsUp adoreThumbsUp adoreThumbsUp adoreThumbsUp
[5:02:52] M1ST3RM1ND: The dog should not be able to open the trunk themselves, honestly.
[5:02:53] puptime: emmeCard moistGood aineMlem moistLove chimer17FINE
[5:03:15] SunDevil56: impressive homework you did there
[5:03:17] SchlafNinja: oh no bud
[5:03:22] SchlafNinja: thats a nono
[5:03:23] JornNightmane: @M1ST3RM1ND Yea... *slowly hides thumbs as a cat* 7w7
[5:03:23] Rare_Dorito: adoreGiggle
[5:03:25] MissJessMJM: Yeah German commands are always the ones that are immediate actions
[5:03:38] txcowboy9: @m1st3rm1nd no the only reason they should be able to open the trunk is for a door pop situation in case the officer goes down
[5:03:47] Tear223: lol, the timing
[5:03:50] Ambi_Trigger: boof
[5:03:50] baconbabies34: She really got that dog in her
[5:03:51] Adorate_Luna: adoreGenji
[5:03:53] krenlash42: adoreGenji adoreZorro
[5:04:00] prez_wilson_28: adoreGenji adoreZorro adoreGenji adoreZorro
[5:04:02] cerendipidi: I think for rp purposes being able to open the door is good
[5:04:07] SunDevil56: Genji's like " I'll show you murder dog!" haha
[5:04:08] identityuknwn: adoreZorro adoreGenji
[5:04:30] MissJessMJM: Yeah K-9 units usually have a release for the dog
[5:04:35] griphen677: they are a thing
[5:04:42] txcowboy9: You should be able to get yourself out of the trunk since it's based on a person I believe
[5:04:43] SchlafNinja: i think rl they at times do a their own pull tag to unlatch
[5:04:46] Android86: the driver could have a boot release button
[5:04:53] baconbabies34: Well actual k9 units have a release button so the officer and open the doors without being at the car
[5:05:11] btkcurly: lol
[5:05:11] griphen677: for service dogs to help their owners if they are in a wheelchair
[5:05:13] JornNightmane: Heh, everytime you angle to just the face, we need a doggo lurk emote hemooxLurk
[5:05:15] M1ST3RM1ND: Yeah in some actual K9 units I think the officer has a button on their duty belt to release the door.
[5:05:21] PvrplxAce49: i got no drugs on me i swear, just taking my meds
[5:05:21] mopp789: dogs can open a door
[5:05:22] Dutch_Tuchd: It's usually a button or pull tab the dogs are trained to use in case of an emergency order.
[5:05:24] MissJessMJM: IRL they have a release on a remote and the dog can actually release if the officer is in danger
[5:05:26] baconbabies34: I will get out of here and shit lord wrangler
[5:05:30] Flamquill: NODDERS
[5:05:31] Rare_Dorito: adoreAwoo
[5:05:32] Archaius: would be cool there was some way for the dog to get back into he car quickly when the unit has to chase someone suddenly
[5:05:35] cerendipidi: yea it also just seems too inconvenient for rp to have to fiddle with controls every time they want to take a dog out
[5:05:36] SchlafNinja: Luna will unleash justice
[5:05:41] krenlash42: Stare
[5:06:01] txcowboy9: @m1st3rm1nd they do along with like a heat alarm system where if it gets too hot in the vehicle it lets the handler know. I build them for a living
[5:06:05] runsontoaster: Luna is vengeance
[5:06:16] Salimufari: @Momo have you read the Wheel of Time? Your monologue reminds me of Hopper
[5:06:22] baconbabies34: Release the dog
[5:06:29] mopp789: The door needs a doggie release cord
[5:06:30] Ambi_Trigger: shock la bleu

[5:57:28] M1ST3RM1ND: Luna is one of Momo's characters in this GTA V roleplay.
[5:57:48] Azureburn: @Killa_Atreyu oh, Momo plays Luna, a bunch of cops wanted to set up a k-9 unit to (among other things) allow people who traditionally couldn't RP (can't speak or extreme social anxiety) to join onx
[5:57:50] M1ST3RM1ND: She's a potential K9 unit if the department gets approved.
[5:58:00] PvrplxAce49: nixon not even looking back to check on doggo, this is a war crime

[5:58:56] Grothmar9: PrideShrug oh well
[5:58:58] M1ST3RM1ND: To explain it, maybe the trunk came open when he hit a bump, and she dropped out?

[6:17:09] JTVham: For people who don't know, when PENTA first made wrangler he did not know what guns or dogs were, so he was terrified of both.
[6:17:13] Anillian: MomoClap
[6:17:33] Src248: GOOD GIRL euiikPoncho
[6:17:35] SchlafNinja: I think you might need a fast relog

[6:19:05] M1ST3RM1ND: When she's talking in Luna's voice, it's just inner monologue, unless she speaks to just Wrangler alone. Momo's concerned at the moment that they can't hear her barks/whines.
[6:19:06] KingCanadaHill: Clarence speaks the truth!!
