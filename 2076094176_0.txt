[1:17:42] EyeofNewt_: who is the mayor?
[1:18:03] MajorPainCA: Chain of command is forced in the PD and you have to work up the chain.  Should be the same with the mayor.  He works down the chain and only communicate with captians.

[1:21:58] MaNSoN6649: Ive only seen him sceeam at slacks
[1:22:10] AnusReaktorMan: Clueless
[1:22:16] looneyfool4ever: I'm not saying he doesn't do a good job and does have priorities in the correct place. I think it's just a delivery issue and misunderstanding
[1:22:19] LukeKR95: facts
[1:22:27] TreMetal: moonmoon has a cop though
[1:23:14] MaNSoN6649: Im sure he will tone down after awhile or hes also gonna get fired
[1:23:30] looneyfool4ever: True
[1:23:37] thalwegg: i think that max is simultaneously really good and really bad at communicating. He has times like the shouting in front of the PD but also after pretty much cop interview so far I think the cop has walked away feeling better about Max as a person
[1:23:52] MaNSoN6649: He does have to respect ppl also
[1:24:00] condor2104: thats crazy
[1:24:15] fiachdubh: @thalwegg To be fair, talking to any of the three captains is the most infuriating thing for most people
[1:24:56] TreMetal: yelling at the group of three stooges who joked about a coup seems kind of reasonable
[1:25:02] ItsAHazardLife: The reason I like that the mayor is stepping in. Is due to the captains not being held accountable. People are tired of there being no response and tired of how the captains handle situations. It's frustrating, brings pd down and makes them look bad.
[1:25:07] MaNSoN6649: LUL LUL LUL
[1:25:18] looneyfool4ever: Yep it feels like talking to a wall with them
[1:26:22] looneyfool4ever: I did feel bad for cornwood and dent
[1:26:34] MaNSoN6649: I think the capt running the od could have worked, but ruth showed that she wants to powergrab the pd, and the city wont allow that
[1:26:39] MaNSoN6649: Pd
[1:27:05] condor2104: You need a Cornwood, Denzel and Aziz.  This is RP, it needs to be entertaining.  Imagine just having drones or NPCs as officers, it would be boring af, imho.

[1:31:20] MrSpiny: nikkisSip

[1:38:14] wintersoldier2712: @iamSamm_ lol I must havve missed the first day or so of stream
[1:38:14] StreamElements: Come join CurvyElephant's Discord at http://discord.gg/curvyelephant
[1:38:23] I_Like_0range: There is a meta channel in the discord in which you can talk meta with chat.
[1:38:28] condor2104: most of us are just discussing RP going on I htink
[1:38:36] kalsvares: @jpolimited it doesnt make sense that the streamer can read chat and see meta?
[1:38:45] jpolimited: yeah, I follow too many streamers to engage like that. it's all good
[1:39:14] jpolimited: it's still the streamers decision, and choice to act upon the information making it meta
[1:39:19] DanLGG: it‚Äôs best to avoid putting it out there so the streamer doesn‚Äôt have to change their to because they read the meta
[1:39:22] thatbritjackHD: Chat don‚Äôt forget to pick your knights branded cigar, they make you at least 150% cooler and pairs well with a nice cup of tea take a look curvyeClassic curvyeTea
[1:39:35] original_khawk: curvyeClassic
[1:39:52] wintersoldier2712: did he say about the 4001 paycheck and having to pay the 3900 of it?
[1:40:02] historygirl2: curvyeClassic
[1:40:02] I_Like_0range: And Curvy does not want any meta in his chat that he does not know. It is his decision on how he wants his chat to behave and be moderated.
[1:40:02] condor2104: The Mayor is hillarious
[1:40:11] jpolimited: I personally feel curvyelephant has been streaming long enough to know the difference.
[1:40:16] wintersoldier2712: and loosing the money for aa 6 hour shift?

[1:41:16] I_Like_0range: there are shared vehicles for cops to use, if they want their own one, they have to buy it
[1:41:23] looneyfool4ever: That's what annoys me to. Mosley's set up a back end program that pd could access to check reimbursement and repairs done. But hey yeh it's damn expensive
[1:41:34] Tambooob: ModTime
[1:41:57] mrbig_668: every other job requires you to buy the vehicle and maintain it

[3:28:16] vyzenya: Yeah, its true everyone has an opinion and their own preference, but this is RP, its not a normal game. This is more of a tv show than a game, streamers are actors

[3:29:14] BrizzyPeezy: curvyeCozy just be cozy and watch the rp
[3:29:26] noragretz_: bruh I'm too old to be drama hopping, I like to see the persons reaction ooc, it's pointless to hop and chat.
[3:29:31] thyL: yea, especially in high drama situations i just go fullscreen
[3:29:37] thyL: chat is fun but not as important as the RP
[3:29:41] vyzenya: @thyL same
[3:29:45] sixteenbackup: any of you guys hate it when you sleep and the rp goes crazy then you have to catch up before the next stream starts uno lmao

[3:30:05] vyzenya: @sixteenbackup one of the reasons i'm sleep deprived...
[3:30:38] Dubbleoseven: i rarely hop only for big occasions and when i do is because i wanna know the tought process of the different streamers involved for example a courtcase ill go watch the judge if he is on aswell.
[3:30:56] sixteenbackup: @sousmatras ahaha I respect it honestly i go work then sleep then wake up for NA times then go work because I‚Äôm up again
[3:31:26] TinySpark: I'm here to hop atinysHop

[3:32:34] CreepeAir: I jump around between RP streams all the time. I just generally dont chat at all LUL
[3:32:36] Nohbob: It's rough hopper season right now, but I think it's folks aren't quite used to the conflict and that while you disagree with the character, that the stream is doing just that.
[3:32:48] thyL: i think we can all differentiate between poppers and noppers (positive and negative hoppers) HypeLUL
[3:32:56] Nohbob: I think there alot of newer viewers.  It's why I love this place.

[3:33:06] iamSamm_: people who have the time to hop between streams and be toxic really have too much time on their hands
[3:33:18] vyzenya: Okay, so I'm an avid XQC viewer, and I hate when people just act maliciously for the sake of creating drama. It's annoying, it breaks character, it creates bad RP
[3:33:32] watemper: what happened i just woke up lol
