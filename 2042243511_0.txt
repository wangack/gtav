[6:57:45] Slaydess7: Hydra was huge, you should listen to their music from P-Money, it's fire
[6:58:01] FRAlex010: sonthis is big you have 3 people who run Sani now
[6:58:05] CRlCK: this rp shit is too good üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

[6:58:21] CRlCK: üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
[6:58:33] CRlCK: tbh
[6:58:50] tictac82: It's amazing how far GTA RP has come. If not for LIRIK (first wave) and summit1g (second wave), who knows where it would be today. @SSGHaseeb
[6:59:34] axmxixrx: EZ
[6:59:46] SSGHaseeb: LIRIK amazing
[6:59:47] Schleten_: @mr_shadi yeah it's very similar.
[7:00:05] jas3y: @tictac82 think soda pumped it up a fair bit too early on right?
[7:00:40] xShikigami: decorating Pog
[7:00:48] tictac82: @jas3y That was the second wave (along with summit1g). LIRIK is the one who introduced gta rp to the masses and made buddha a household name in the community (LEANBOIS)
[7:01:05] pamcakesxbacon: summit will be back when he is doene with tarkov
[7:01:06] PrettyKrazy: because it sucks you in
[7:01:08] PrettyKrazy: probly
[7:01:15] Mr_Shadi: @Schleten_ Nice, i think with beer from what i see in movies you either love it or hate it unless you just want a small buzz to get though the day :)
[7:01:21] jas3y: summit mainly enjoys driving normally comes in a bit later with the cars
[7:01:23] RenOfficially: sumSmash got mad at racing and took a break like every couple of months
[7:01:26] Clodhoppr: wont matter for him lol

[7:01:35] Guielme: in 3 days summit will have the best car already
[7:01:36] ublivious: he's with cg
[7:01:39] pamcakesxbacon: he just wana race
[7:01:39] Cenar96: nah it doesn‚Äôt he will probably join cg again
[7:01:44] j4cka1_: CG will pick him up and show him everything
[7:01:44] Uzbekki: yeah summit just join mr K and is millionaire when he joins
[7:01:46] Clodhoppr: and he's a top driver, he needa wait for the real cars to pop off
[7:01:50] ignorexo: Summit has to wait until the contract runs out with prod, Lirik im not sure
[7:02:12] Bags94: hell prolly be robbing banks his first day lol
[7:02:18] RasenRendan: time to cook!
[7:02:40] tictac82: LIRIK is burnt out with RP, he'll probably return once GTA 6 rp is a thing.
[7:02:46] Guielme: isnt better to go for better gpus instead filling all racks with the bad one
[7:02:52] Schleten_: @mr_shadi yeah it's a special taste so either you like it or you learn to like it. Like coffee. I doubt anyone liked their first sip of black coffee lmao.
[7:02:52] tictac82: It's a shame because he's hilarious.
[7:03:04] jas3y: now ask him how the wood is coming along for the house OMEGALUL
[7:03:13] Mr_Shadi: @tictac82 i cant wait to see what people will do with gta 6 the possibilities are endless
[7:03:28] tictac82: @Mr_Shadi I hear ya! It's gonna be so fun to watch!
[7:03:40] kr4kk3nn: its probably time to sing a song
[7:03:43] luis_king82: what?????
[7:04:01] blackdoos: raia flirting via email
[7:04:04] TremarGJI: nah we dont know shit about gta6 besides that it has dope gfx
[7:04:10] fnaskdas: 26 minutes
[7:04:13] ignorexo: Imagine NP Devs get access to the gta 6 engine, the stuff they could do would be unreal @Mr_Shadi
[7:04:18] RasenRendan: always loved watching Summit do the races in 3.0. i really hope Nick actually does races
[7:04:23] luis_king82: noo. is Nick Bday now!!!!!
[7:04:36] theace8869: The house is starting to look real nice

[7:06:06] TremarGJI: EU time? yeah its in 25 min
[7:06:11] CRlCK: yes norway
[7:06:16] HandofOdd: Patar can do sani in the mornings
[7:06:18] Mr_Shadi: @Schleten_ haha i actually did am arab from the levant and we roast our coffee real dark and typically its in all households ready for guests but nowadays very few people make it and ever since i was a little kid i would visit my grandma and first thing she did was offer me a cup because i loved it the acidity does something to my brain . but when it comes to regular day to day coffee we prepare arabic/turkish coffee and i dont feel connected to it that much...
[7:06:22] ignorexo: Gta 6 about to be NP 5.0 lol in a good way
[7:06:29] mishegas: prospect of fsg
[7:06:49] CRlCK: @mishegas swear to god i read something else
[7:06:50] tictac82: HUH

[7:47:19] Phonoman_: you cannot delete the 0, needs to be at least a number, add in front
[7:47:22] geshlem: @iHarsh29 because you have to put the rack down before you can add the GPUs Pepega
[7:47:23] AgadhiTheGreat: Use the chair

[7:49:30] sir_philip3: Probably what happend with the pc the other day I copied and pasted in the same place so there were 2 pc in the same place and it fucked the pcs
[7:49:30] axmxixrx: run away and come back maybe
[7:49:31] RealWicari: space for "place" maybe?
[7:49:32] the_may_queen_: just getting back from yesterday, looks like you‚Äôve become an engineer lol
[7:49:34] GRAYURSUSTANA: try and place it downstairs while looking into the ground
[7:49:35] AgadhiTheGreat: Probably safer to use the chairs coordinates rather than the other rack
[7:49:40] Kangaroo_Balls: might as well just place that rack on the bottom floor if anyways you guys will be moving computers downstairs
[7:49:43] 0_sh: how about copy, move the original then paste?
[7:50:00] Uzbekki: COPY COPY COPY!

[7:52:26] Thunderpint: Wall is def not straight

[7:52:39] 42arc: it's fine, as long as it works
[7:52:39] 0_sh: is it not just the rack rotation?
[7:52:39] kitoisblooming: it's the angle
[7:52:40] AgadhiTheGreat: Its fine, you're gonna redo the room anyway
[7:52:41] momzzyy: is vee in game bf offline chat? LUL LUL

[7:53:11] simmeringteapot: also the lighting is horrid
[7:53:13] Jglewd: you could change the angles of the racks too slightly
[7:53:13] Xerhro: Nice
[7:53:16] topmiddle: i guess its the angle you have to put them in
[7:53:18] isp1337: maybe desk or first rack is just crooked?
[7:53:19] Tresch: Pog
[7:53:20] StreamElements: POEG Pog
[7:53:20] Janizu: rack is couple of degrees of too

[7:53:27] RealBalckeN: its fine for now
[7:53:29] topmiddle: the structure of the house is not even i guess
[7:53:31] kitoisblooming: the angle is not 100%
[7:53:31] Taxike: Start from 0, Might be easier
[7:53:34] Thunderpint: Yeah the first rack is not in the wall
[7:53:37] xShikigami: yeah coz Z rotation is not -125
[7:53:37] kablard: You need some light
[7:53:39] Raazeraz: Its definedly on angle
[7:53:42] sh0wtime6: this house is cursed, cg should sell up and upgrade haha
[7:53:43] consequences77: if you place it in the wall more space in the room great idea
[7:53:44] Burntnaan: need some lights in the house first xD
[7:53:44] talalllll22: my OCD brain can't handle this
[7:53:44] jas3y: i guess if u notice the wall crooked when u do the real thing maybe start from a corner might be less noticable
[7:53:48] Clodhoppr: no need to worry about it now
[7:53:52] Phonoman_: it's fine, you'll redo eveything anyways, right?

[7:54:13] Millsboro: wall has an angle
[7:54:13] Jglewd: change the z rotation a little to account for crookedness
[7:54:15] FaIcon96: Rotate a bit?
[7:54:16] denjeey: Burn the house down and try again
[7:54:17] seix123: you need to learn the positions and rotations with numbers, otherwise you are fcked
[7:54:18] BoJackJohnsson: Try placing them as an L
[7:54:20] Millsboro: move them all to the other side
[7:54:21] hajimea: Maybe the floor is not straight?
[7:54:21] topmiddle: yes, might be the angle
[7:54:24] warnivea: the angle of the first rack might be off
[7:54:24] 42arc: if you pick wall, you will see x y z positions and can align them if you like
[7:54:26] raizzel_azzer: don‚Äôt worry about you will move it all soon
[7:54:27] axmxixrx: look at the tile lines along the wall
[7:54:31] Alaineman: Doesn't matter too much for now if you're gonna redecorate it anyway
[7:54:33] rxratatat: YEP pretty good
[7:54:33] Dano_Leza: that looks sick!!

[8:06:37] Alaineman: I feel like it's easier to keep Jay in the house but keep his crime stuff out until you all do crime
[8:06:44] korte2023: Drama creates views I guess
[8:06:54] Tenivir: guys backseating here doesnt magically fix the Jay thing

[8:08:31] StreamElements: Do not share in-game information regarding other players/content creators. Acie doesn't want to know and this can instead harm in-game decisions.

[8:24:26] xShikigami: bottom
[8:24:26] Marilyn_1020: top
[8:24:27] Zavgu: pepeMeltdown
[8:24:27] Alaineman: This is the hard part,
[8:24:27] ChristopherLee0204: start at the top
[8:24:28] umudoffy: First floor
[8:24:28] blackdoos: remove everything and start over
[8:24:28] Black_Griffin: i guess top to experiment first?
[8:24:28] nikulaz_: the bathroom is a prefab, which every singlie apartment has. You can ask everyone to get their prefabs from their apartments
[8:24:29] HandofOdd: Pick a floor and focus on it
[8:24:29] iHarsh29: start from staircase
[8:24:29] kujoez: top
[8:24:30] imay_xo: to
[8:24:30] Ginoveli: i dont think i ever been this crossfaded this before
[8:24:31] cebron808: set a layout
[8:24:31] elgoonies: bottom
[8:24:34] Crewcabanger24: it would be better to move everything down
[8:24:35] Karmas_Weapon: could experiment and learn, then commit tomorrow
[8:24:35] m331o: clean all start over
[8:24:35] iHarsh29: staircase
[8:24:35] BlindFlapjack: bottom up
[8:24:39] andrefvm: The stairs should be first for the layout
[8:24:41] ArtemisRost: bottom do it youre right!!!
[8:24:41] tenzogamez: Im iterested in what you are gonna do with all the comps and servers
[8:24:42] xLOWxKEYx: I think stairs are might be the prio
[8:24:42] funkyb88: NuNu üí´
[8:24:42] axmxixrx: from bottom to top is the best way
[8:24:42] jesleaks: Move the PCs down, delete everything else. Start over @Acie
[8:24:44] tictac82: 2 floors with a secret room that is walled off?
[8:24:44] xczak: @RealWicari yup, they don't tell anything to each other KEKW
[8:24:45] Ginoveli: i am in actualk trouble
[8:24:45] Kangaroo_Balls: the very first thing to do IMO is move computers to bottom floor, the more you delay moving the computer the more buttcoin you risk losing
[8:24:46] t3trabrikk: is empty and you can test
[8:24:46] crookz_n_castlez: huh
[8:24:47] H311nBRAND: the bottom so you have a non-scuffedplace to move the computers to do the second floor
[8:24:47] AFFABLE__: arent you deleting the entire second floor
[8:24:49] GRAYURSUSTANA: bottom is best bc it will dictate the rest of the floors
[8:24:49] ChaseBands_: stairs first
[8:24:50] GreyLothric: Having a foundation is best
[8:24:50] iHarsh29: atleast craft it
[8:24:55] Krydun: do bottom floor and put computers then work on the top
[8:24:57] raizzel_azzer: bottom to move pc down
[8:25:00] idfiatok42069: its joever SAJ
[8:25:02] retarcl: Acietect
[8:25:05] funkyb88: you got this
[8:25:10] lowestnewt: @Krydun this
[8:25:11] Slaydess7: You could take more place on the floor on top but start wherever you think is best
[8:25:13] Phonoman_: just one of each level and map out one side of house to see the heights?
[8:25:14] DestroyerOfFatez: Good luck on your HGTC arc
[8:25:15] NovaSwarm1: It seems like the car parts and dirty money are the only things that could get you guys in trouble at this point.
[8:25:18] riadaich: use exra large for bottom no ?
[8:25:25] TheGreatWac: i give you permission LuL
[8:25:25] HandofOdd: Then literally bottom floor and hard wood.
[8:25:26] SpecialAgentSkye: Prayge No scuff
[8:25:28] ArtemisRost: seems like a good plan
[8:25:29] rxratatat: I dont want to to spread negativity in this chat. It's not that hard to find what he said about Dima
[8:25:31] jesleaks: Remove everything so you have a clean slate. Place PCs and stuff bottom floor @Acie
[8:25:31] ChaseBands_: the whole house gets built around the staircase..
[8:25:33] mrgamer0909: @Acie and @chat love ya guys! Glad that I found you acie I love your RP!
[8:25:34] cebron808: move everything to the basement, then you can  work freely
[8:25:40] PusherXP: those are moved in catalog

[8:26:07] 2wicked001: need the blue pill for hard wood

[8:26:10] AFFABLE__: grandpa money
[8:26:16] YoinkDoink: are they making hidden rooms?
[8:26:18] Janizu: you really want to type right rotations and height for floors
[8:26:20] SpecialAgentSkye: Prayge Prayge Prayge Prayge Prayge Prayge Prayge Prayge Prayge Prayge Prayge
[8:26:20] justCoopp: NOTED
[8:26:21] Alaineman: Here we go chat, bets on how much stuff poofs?
[8:26:26] tenzogamez: great idea
[8:26:33] Tenivir: MattNeedler i mean she can but she starting with floors and walls and working her way up i think
[8:26:39] crookz_n_castlez: how is there not a youtube tutorial for this
[8:26:42] 42arc: you can change settings
[8:26:46] simmeringteapot: the basement ceiling should be raised, its too low
[8:26:46] HandofOdd: Sims was easier to navigate through
[8:26:55] Karmas_Weapon: Gonna be useful for future houses if you learn how to decorate well
[8:26:58] AFFABLE__: You wont be able to put the floor dowh as the spiral staircase is in the way
[8:27:02] DestroyerOfFatez: One thing Ive seen that helps a lot is typing in coordinates to line up the stuff
[8:27:04] raizzel_azzer: remove that
[8:27:05] riadaich: i was waiting all day for building crumpIes crumpIes crumpIes

[8:27:28] fnaskdas: Building time Pog
[8:27:31] TacoShake222: washing machine
[8:27:37] iHarsh29: you need to delete the stairs to put the ground

[8:47:21] Thunderpint: press g
[8:47:21] vyjinx: x Rotation
[8:47:23] dr_tortoise: its not the c one i swear
[8:47:24] Alaineman: Gotta set it to 90 in the item position coordinates or everything is gonna be crooked
[8:47:24] Ace1507: cant you use G now since its bottom floor ?
[8:47:25] Thunderpint: should even it
[8:47:25] iHarsh29: coordinates

[8:47:41] iHarsh29: yep there is
[8:47:42] ewweg: on the right side put X at 90
[8:47:45] BoJackJohnsson: G for ground
[8:47:45] kitoisblooming: -90.1 so not 90
[8:47:47] DylBKR: -90 should be what you want
[8:47:49] ArcticViper009: Rotation values on the right need to be 0 or 90
[8:47:51] ChaseBands_: that‚Äôs the wrong one though
[8:47:53] axmxixrx: X rotation -90
[8:47:53] Clodhoppr: perfect

[8:48:11] DylBKR: That works
[8:48:13] Mr_Shadi: it changed

[8:49:16] Alaineman: Is this the correct wood?
[8:49:21] printerman22: @acie not the c version noraexCry

[8:49:29] lowestnewt: @dylbkr this
[8:49:30] niqqqita: Wrong floor colour
[8:49:35] jesleaks: The house isn't centered with the world, so you don't know the exact rotation of the floor
[8:49:36] iHarsh29: corner
[8:49:36] Tresch: clipping it into the floor gives you more space to work with
[8:49:37] DJ_Jenks: Z ROT 90
[8:49:38] MillaZenik: this doesn't look right
[8:49:45] ibemanny: is it me or the floor looks different

[8:51:12] DJ_Jenks: yes
[8:51:15] Thunderpint: There we go boom!

[8:51:46] Phonoman_: cant u delete that floating one
[8:51:46] DJ_Jenks: -30
[8:51:47] Alaineman: -30?
[8:51:51] VaporyFurball30: 30
[8:51:52] Thunderpint: z was like -31
[8:51:54] AgadhiTheGreat: -30
[8:51:55] printerman22: that‚Äôs the shiny one
[8:51:56] Alaineman: nah it won't be a nice number
[8:51:59] VaporyFurball30: -30
[8:51:59] Guielme: -30
[8:52:03] andrefvm: Depends on the house orientation
[8:52:10] jesleaks: You don't know the rotation of the house compared to the world, so you don't know the Z rotation @Acie
[8:52:12] pjeweb: change to local? Q?
[8:52:13] niqqqita: That is the wrong type of wood. Jason choose another.
[8:52:13] DylBKR: 0 or 90 again I think
[8:52:17] ArcticViper009: Z rotation is going to be weird because the house isn't on the grid perfectly
[8:52:19] Guielme: before the 0
[8:52:22] Capt4inJuli: 330
[8:52:25] andrefvm: use a dash
[8:52:25] MRAPL: -30
[8:52:31] Alaineman: nope, that's gonna be annoying
[8:52:32] extrafrozen: Try increasing the "snap movement" and "snap rotation" sliders on the right, it might make it easier to get the correct positions
[8:52:34] Felancor: -25
[8:52:35] FRAlex010: the wrong floor
[8:52:37] jesleaks: You don't know the rotation of the house compared to the world, the X, Y and Z is linked to the world, house is on an anfgle, so you don't know the Z rotation @Acie
[8:52:38] VaporyFurball30: lol the house aint straight
[8:52:41] pjeweb: change to local coordinates with Q?
[8:52:42] axmxixrx: -45
[8:52:43] Guielme: you need to keep trying to find the house angle
[8:52:43] Thunderpint: holy shit it is LUL
[8:52:47] Q_Erisa: -25 maybe?
[8:52:47] Capt4inJuli: -28
[8:52:50] Guielme: try like 27 or 28
[8:52:52] Jackpic07: its realism
[8:52:54] DJ_Jenks: you need to find out the angel of the wall first @Acie
[8:52:55] cebron808: -29
[8:52:55] pilhass10: lmao
[8:52:55] StreamElements: LMAI PepeLaugh
[8:52:57] DJ_Jenks: to match it
[8:52:57] MRAPL: just find the angle 1ce and u can copy that amount to everything
[8:52:58] Joao_from_Portugal: cant u move it with cursors?
[8:52:58] Guielme: 27.5
[8:53:00] ArcticViper009: I wouldn't use the numbers for the z rotation. Use the ball
[8:53:00] Ace1507: are these selfmade walls or is the house just scuffed ?
[8:53:01] fluxNikko: yup SNAP
[8:53:03] Capt4inJuli: a little less
[8:53:03] Xerhro: So hows home makeover going
[8:53:04] DylBKR: Once you have the rotation Co-ords you can just repeat
[8:53:05] andrefvm: Have to clip the floor into the wall
[8:53:07] venyalorelei: -27.4
[8:53:07] Capt4inJuli: 27.8
[8:53:10] Felancor: -27,5

[8:53:37] lowestnewt: thats decent there
[8:53:37] VaporyFurball30: remember 27.1
[8:53:38] MeleeGames: TAKE NOTES! you have a note book
[8:53:41] andrefvm: It's better for you to use even numbers and just clip the corners on the wall
[8:53:41] Mr_Shadi: i think make it 30 so other pieces are easier to line up and just stick it out of the house a lil
[8:53:41] Uzbekki: you neeeeeed to set a number so u can always do the same
[8:53:42] DylBKR: 27.1883

[9:36:26] Mr_Shadi: so when you put an xxl on the other end they wont overlay
[9:36:26] FrankkDawg: I just hop'd in. I'd start from the edge and work inward, maybe?

[10:02:32] StreamElements: your_pal_stine, no
[10:02:32] Kangaroo_Balls: once computers and stuff are in the basement, you can experiement with 2 or 3 floors
[10:02:34] funkyb88: 3 basically means cramped ceilings
[10:02:34] FrankkDawg: fly down with the cam
[10:02:35] SebasBP28: hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi

[10:03:02] kujoez: 3 floors is not even worth tbh
[10:03:02] raizzel_azzer: console maybe
[10:03:03] jesleaks: Make a wall on 2nd floor that hides the overhang. Just ignore the part that goes inwards, and make it same size as 3rd floor @Acie
[10:03:03] kitoisblooming: console on the door

[10:03:09] rudytc: thought you could extend the bottom floor down
[10:03:10] bigtex494: Second opinion
[10:03:15] MRAPL: ask him
[10:03:18] Motraxtv: you can go as deep as the stairs are at the moment
[10:03:24] Neon_Zebra_: you can also make the top floor a little higher then the door?
[10:03:30] cebron808: got key on u ?

[10:03:56] SebasBP28: Prayge
[10:03:57] flashultx: do a very short first floor
[10:04:06] fluxNikko: You don't need the top floor. It can just be the entrance platform, then wall off the walls on the perimeter of the second fl.  I'm an architect.
[10:04:09] elgoonies: just block it off
[10:04:09] raizzel_azzer: ask did he did it
[10:04:11] Rokuach: You didn't have a key previously when you tried to change wall colors
[10:04:11] nykter1: Wall it off for the 2d floor only
[10:04:11] ewweg: u can just wall it off
[10:04:14] Phonoman_: use that little extra space for the secret corridor for crawling or smtn and wall it off elsewhere maybe?
[10:04:14] Freppuchino: you can put bookshelves? or decos
[10:04:14] Clodhoppr: if you do 2 two floors you could also just make a 2 to 3 step drop into the first floor
[10:04:14] bornraisedusa: use server rack to make bottom height
[10:04:15] Capt4inJuli: just make 2 floors
[10:04:16] Tenivir: i think the heights you adjusted it to now is good, just gonna have to live with blocking off overhang
[10:04:17] VaeelL: is that a problem tho ? it's the perfect size tu put barrels in that little space
[10:04:18] BorealisLumina: There was definitely an option to add floors, maybe raia has to do it
[10:04:19] iHarsh29: i got a great idea
[10:04:20] victornor: The stairs seem kinda solid and came with the house. Don't think you can change that
[10:04:21] kitoisblooming: first floor a bit higher?
[10:04:21] stopandrun: wall off the overhang
[10:04:22] ExcessFC: nah you just wall off the tiny ovehang on the entry level floor
[10:04:22] jesleaks: You can totally ignore the overhang. Make the 2nd floor same size as 3rd floor, just continue the wall past down over the overhang
[10:04:24] scarves: you can add another floor just ask dex for it it will solve all your issue it cost a little bit of money
[10:04:25] shubo2014: first floor is basement anyways so it can be low i guess
[10:04:26] fewe___: @Acie u can hide overhang in the different room, bookshelfes etc
[10:04:26] Bestevenn_: Bookshelfs
[10:04:27] ediez: maybe wall it off it's the best
[10:04:29] qihk: wall it off or make a secret wall for server racks.
[10:04:29] Thunder_Nikk: whats wrong with short floors
[10:04:29] raizzel_azzer: ask dex he did it in his house
[10:04:31] BananasOP89: @Acie 2 floors and make second on that ridge. and make small stairs from main door
[10:04:33] sixnineenjoyer: dig down
[10:04:33] Capt4inJuli: make 2 floors and add another in the future
[10:04:33] Muffinsrevil00: but then you can just use them for server racks storage ect
[10:04:34] raizzel_azzer: ask dex he did it in his house.
[10:04:35] iHarsh29: make walls and make a secret hiding space
[10:04:35] DaveShadows: could make like a crawlspace behind it?
[10:04:36] Guielme: trueee, wall it of is a good play
[10:04:38] ArcticViper009: When in doubt, wall it off lol
[10:04:38] DaftFrik: or put storage under it

[10:04:50] funkyb88: NuNu is back noraexL
[10:04:54] iHarsh29: secret server racks hiding spots
[10:04:55] Turboz__: @Acie u have vaulted ceiling on the first floor. so you could build up a little
[10:04:55] B33RYE: Wall it off and use that crawl space to access hidden room?
[10:04:55] SebasBP28: SAJ
[10:04:56] Roro_____: do 2 floors, and ask raia to buy more basement space on console @Acie

[12:31:14] MonMunn: fill the empty space with a small floor maybe
[12:31:14] nikulaz_: turn the stairs towards us

[12:32:24] FaZu_23: no need for L
[12:32:26] Kangaroo_Balls: stairs along the wall then you dn't have to worry bout walling off one side of the stairs, otherwise you need to build walls on both side
[12:32:31] Ted_Zack: i cant wait to see the house after its done with all the furnishing
[12:32:32] KnocturnalSLO: Lol
[12:32:36] nikulaz_: not enough room for L
