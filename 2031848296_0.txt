[0:50:34] eBridgette: right like in an explainable way or a constructive way
[0:50:42] ghostreconspart: But if a film isn't for you, wouldn't you perceive the praise its getting as overrating it? It feels like they're saying the same thing.

[0:52:51] eBridgette: right, like an emotional reaction to the social setting, rather than something they can specify
[0:53:05] ghostreconspart: Overrated as engagement bait
[0:53:09] alisacarlotta: @mb11080 yes exactly he was amazing
[0:53:10] ghostreconspart: yeah I get what youre saying
[0:53:12] mangovsko: I‚Äôm not the biggest romance girly and the scene at the bar where the male characters connect took the movie to another level for me

[0:53:25] spyrit14: Constructive criticism doesn't happen much on the internet
[0:53:31] u1traaviol3t: its just feels like theyre invalidating anyones opinions bc something is popular
[0:53:31] ConcussedKeeper: You can objectively appreciate something, and think subjectively that you don't like it, thus, it's not for you
[0:53:32] SelfCareWellBeing: yeah, saying something is overrated, is lazy, unless they can refer to who rated it overly? Lol
[0:53:38] alisacarlotta: the word overrated is overrated its tired its boring

[0:54:39] ashley61202: I also feel like on twitter nothing can be appropriately rated, it‚Äôs either overrated or underrated
[0:54:40] yarismaris: Have you seen Skin I Live In ? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Skin_I_Live_In Amazing weird out Film kinda touches on some important topics of self indulgence of beauty
[0:54:52] brenair: I respect a persons enthusiasm for a movie they like, that's what I'm into in a conversation about movies, if you're really into a particular movie and wanna share, I'm here for it. Doesn't matter the movie at that point
[0:55:07] eBridgette: yeeeeeee
[0:55:10] alisacarlotta: i went into past lives with no expectations and i feel like a lot of people have made up their mind before they even watch a movie these days

[1:24:11] xmangolacroix: I loved her when she was younger in the fundamentals of caring
[1:24:16] lush_puppies: she's great when she has a wand and her dad is a fan of The Mets

[1:24:46] riot_vision710: its mediocre on mediocre
[1:24:55] jesstaras: I‚Äôll say it: Selena has had too much work done to her face to pull off a biopic
[1:25:02] theotherDW: i saw an article that selena's met with her and likes her apparently
[1:25:06] comradekatie: @jesstaras what
[1:25:06] Liquescence: oh i didnt know that part, i suppose it's her call then
[1:25:08] Marco_Bayod: I just watched the episode he is in Gossip Girl
[1:25:08] Anonemesss: susuWave kaisa
[1:25:16] slaturn: D:
[1:25:17] SkyeEva: @jesstaras some of the way her face looks is due to her illness so i'd steer away from that commentary
[1:25:18] jorboforyou: she was good in spring breakers
[1:25:18] XGUawesomer: she can suprise us

[1:25:41] YourDeadNeopet: YEP
[1:25:42] SkyeEva: She's a producer on her own tv show !!!!!!!
[1:25:42] eBridgette: let her liiiive
[1:25:45] lush_puppies: sometimes you can get away with lipsyncing in biopics, but you need to back that up with a helluva performance. like Jamie Foxx in Ray
[1:25:48] SarahMaehem: Sad
[1:25:50] baguetteearl: YEP
[1:25:50] SkyeEva: she's an adult in the industry !!!!

[1:26:02] ADMITTEDFLUNKYY: she‚Äôs problematic
[1:26:05] Jaybabesuke: selena gomez has worn out my charitability after everything at this point
[1:26:05] Auraean: She's riding on that baby face for people to protect her
[1:26:05] XGUawesomer: LEAVE SELENA ALONE STOP
[1:26:08] DanielPilgrim: Selena name searches and is toxic online, she knows
[1:26:10] cam_tram: tbh if we're gonna keep making biopics i think we need to start casting more unknown actors. like talent aside selina gomez is always gonna b selina gomez to me in a movie
[1:26:18] LampIsFun: it definitely stems from her being in a lot of peoples childhood shows
[1:26:20] b_r_203215: There's so many biopics
[1:26:23] CJspyker: watch 21 savage trailer

[1:26:45] sage8634: Bob Marley biopic looks mid
[1:26:45] theotherDW: they can't all be the eyes of tammy faye
[1:26:48] emsjems: trueeee
[1:26:49] baguetteearl: the most interesting "biopic" was the bob dylan one 'im not there'
[1:26:52] kaisa: biopics oscar bait
[1:26:52] creyes11: Biopics are getting worse and worse i feel like
[1:27:01] glass19403: i will always watch anything selena is on, but biopics are pretty boring lately i agree
[1:27:02] xxSayden: what are some good modern biopics @carolinekwan
[1:27:05] mb11080: A different topic. We talked about Amadeus a few streams ago and I watched. It was amazing.
[1:27:10] dranovzeldan: What is your opinion on Bohemian Rhapsody?
[1:27:10] SkyeEva: Biopics shouldnt just be bait, they should be really sincere
[1:27:17] theotherDW: jessica chastain's tammy faye is my barameter now for biopics lol
[1:27:21] cosmic_diabetic: We have to be near the end of this phase of just biopic after biopic it's just being run into the ground.

[1:27:36] CJspyker: i expect Bob Marley to decent
[1:27:37] comradekatie: YEP
[1:27:45] YourDeadNeopet: KEKW
[1:27:47] sheepy_fluff: for some reason specifically biopics about of musicians just don't work
[1:27:48] riot_vision710: THEY SO WERE DISTRACTING
[1:27:49] Big_McLarge_Huge: @xxSayden i loved rocketman as a bio-fantasy musical
[1:27:50] lush_puppies: that series of biopics in the mid-2000s really hit different. I Walk The Line, Ray, I'm Not There, Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story KEKW
[1:27:50] Gorbograndman: It was mad harsh on freddie

[1:28:19] Liquescence: cause i'm a huge Queen fan
[1:28:19] mb11080: What is the best biopic in yout opinion?
