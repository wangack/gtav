[0:05:19] onlyOmi: @farah__ imho the easiest way to get into the rp motions is to find one that'll keep you to your rp, not in a demeaning way but in a way that builds habits for you to catch on to

[0:07:45] onlyOmi: one big thing to keep in mind tho is that the public non-whitelist casual servers *WILL* have shitty people yelling slurs and being grindlords, it'll feel like a slightly more advanced GTA online lobby in a non-whitelist
