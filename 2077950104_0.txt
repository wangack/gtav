[1:16:53] detredwings: it's called child support
[1:16:53] dabbasaurus19: yes
[1:16:54] Leg0s: there’s child support
[1:16:54] magic_freak: The 15k a month in alimony
[1:16:54] pewthy: That's child support no?
[1:16:55] Dan_S__: depends, doesnt have to be
[1:16:56] Cephyric: Alimony is separate from the civorce settlement
[1:16:56] ChemicalPpt: Yeah if they are under 18
[1:17:02] Leg0s: and they have to use the child support for the kid
[1:17:02] Watchur: That's child support. Alamo is for the spouse
[1:17:04] Galileothe1: he has to pay child support but the mum gets to choose how to spend it
[1:17:05] IO_Err0r: yes usually child support is seperate
[1:17:08] Anthonylown83: Anthonylown83 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 35 months! he said 15k child support a month
[1:17:08] MakingMischiefs: Typically the mother has to seperate the money
[1:17:12] spAnser: I have no idea but I assume the child support is for the kids. But as a parent the money is also clearly for the kids as well if they are still < 18
[1:17:13] vel_loca: No, the court has to believe that the mother is spending the money on her and the children both.
[1:17:13] Watchur: Alimony*

[1:17:37] 浩浩大海: PayUp i need 15k
[1:17:38] KatjeMauw: techincally its for the costs or rising a kid, if you spend it a on a car you can probably be sued
[1:17:39] magic_freak: @kay_clare wolfaHii
[1:17:41] kevsnor: I need a kid now please
[1:17:44] sandbeardz: my ex made more then i did when we divorced and i still had to pay her and not the other way around and it was 50\50 joint custody
[1:17:44] kingdomFX: SpareQuid PayUp
[1:17:45] dabbasaurus19: he must of been loaded
[1:17:45] Leg0s: when one person pays the other the person in charge of the money has to separate it for the kid to pay for their stuff ie. food clothes recreation
[1:17:45] pointless197: it's based on the standard of life they had before the divorce so it makes sense. dads don't get to take all the shit and leave and leave the wife with the kids and nothing

[1:18:44] pewthy: My dad took my mum to court to say he couldn't afford to pay it, they called him pathetic and said the state would pay it, it wasn't worth the effort
[1:18:47] MobileArmor: Umm
[1:18:48] Galileothe1: my dad didnt pay when he left the country for a while classic
