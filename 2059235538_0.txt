[0:18:11] FSouza_01: I mean, if the dap is warranted then he should get it regardless KEKW
[0:18:19] tr0kgaming: I think hes getting his job back ICANT
[0:18:22] Verion: is it PD fault or Den
[0:18:22] thetaxguy69: AlienPls AlienPls
[0:18:22] Get2DaChoppa707: what was Bonnie’s punishment for that shooting she was in?
[0:18:24] Mr_Mikeys: probably if the trail is fair
[0:18:26] Nsan7: what about qualified immunity?
[0:18:27] RonJon: i meant like, he might not win if he sued Den himself
[0:18:28] Abdoullah21: was he hit by den or the crime
[0:18:31] dakota22446: what would scott steiner think
[0:18:31] Abdoullah21: crims
[0:18:34] xchita9898: Suarez getting fired if Den gets Daps for pitting KEKW
[0:18:34] slymox: how could eugene zuckerberg do this?
[0:18:39] nickgmiller: give him the class before you dap him so he stays at 9 @ssaab
[0:18:40] gingermickygaming: It would be Johnson vs den not the pd
[0:18:40] danny__244: he should get a huge amount of money
[0:18:42] Konkwistador_1002: but it doesnt mean that someone made a mistake
[0:18:54] m1tchole: @dakota22446 HE'S FAT
[0:19:00] dakota22446: SteinerMath
[0:19:01] gingermickygaming: For damages and loss off income
[0:19:04] DCSeth: yeah this is a civil suit not a criminal one
[0:19:07] Eddie1225: PoppaFlex
[0:19:09] RonJon: qualified immunity DOES protect individual divil liability
[0:19:09] tr0kgaming: Only would sue Den if he was off duty
[0:19:11] m1tchole: You know they say that all men are created equal, but you look at me and you look at Samoa Joe and you can see that statement is not true. See, normally if you go one on one with another wrestler, you got a 50/50 chance of winning. But I'm a genetic freak and I'm not normal! So you got a 25%, AT BEST, at beat me. Then you add Kurt Angle to the mix, your chances of winning drastic go down.
[0:19:12] Moobot: Thanks for subbing, R_eckt! Welcome to the Saabscribers! saabH
[0:19:13] rubenx310: no loss of income homeless

[0:19:56] c0rnishatheart: The clip is too good tbh
[0:20:00] Eddie1225: chat when you get authorized for a pit you get told WHEN SAFE
[0:20:01] LluagorED: yep
[0:20:03] BigglesVII: @N0Biggy Its on the screen, SOP says pits should only be done when safe
[0:20:03] Eddie1225: if someone got hit
[0:20:06] spookyghost21: So why Did Mcnulty not get DAP'ed for sending someone off a bridge ?
[0:20:06] Eddie1225: its not safe
[0:20:06] Blair63: wow Aziz getting den fired how could he do this TwitchConHYPE
[0:20:09] gingermickygaming: Yes
[0:20:12] Artsii1994: yes
[0:20:13] cethin2: How long does authorization of a pit last though?
[0:20:13] FinexLive: 100%
[0:20:14] c0rnishatheart: when is it safe to pit tbh
[0:20:15] Mr_Mikeys: didn't somebodyy tell  him to pit oor no?
[0:20:22] joewelch29: he thought it was
[0:20:22] HogballTV: I want a union strike against the PD
[0:20:23] windstaff54: i think regardless of dens perspective, its still an issue a civ got hit regardless. that falls on the officer who pit the car
[0:20:27] urkuri92: @spookyghost21 he asked for a DAP for that situation and for it to be looked at LUL
[0:20:28] dakota22446: Nessie
[0:20:29] xchita9898: So this policy will apply to all cops ??
[0:20:33] rclemon_: I personally dont think Den should get dapped for this SAJ
[0:20:35] Nv_MonsteR: it was lucky he only hit one nearly took 3 out hahah
[0:20:37] Artsii1994: you do a safe pit when its safe but if someone is in the way of said pit then thats something
[0:20:37] gingermickygaming: And when safe to do so you wouldn't pit in an area where you know there always peoplem
[0:20:38] RonJon: @c0rnishatheart as long as someone doesn't get hit its safe i guess
[0:20:39] tr0kgaming: I think sometimes even when it is safe that is not 100% a given that PD actions wont result in civilian or property damage
[0:20:45] FinexLive: why wouldn't it be criminal tho in this case?
[0:20:47] MexiBrent: @Mr_Mikeys it was authorized for pit on the chase, but he decided when and where to do it
[0:20:49] Eddie1225: @spookyghost21 he did
[0:20:52] spookyghost21: @urkuri92 thats what i am saying he asked for one and they didnt give him one lmao

[0:41:14] jessielight: He's been working so hard too...ugh this is hard
[0:41:22] FinexLive: @Eddie1225 just like firing at that point, if loosing a dap is 60 days
[0:41:22] WildWillie419: it’s just a freak accident
[0:41:24] windstaff54: honestly im confused which parkling lot slacks is talking about ngl
[0:41:26] BoogieAnimal: For this pit and the information given I dont think den should get a dap IMO
[0:41:38] Switchblade142: Yeah sometimes shit just happens, bad luck.
[0:41:46] seanlew123: i think it would the same with anyone else
[0:41:50] jessielight: talk about a series of unfortunate events
[0:41:54] RoninGundam: if most officers think they would pit there, then i dont think its on den - more of a new lesson to teach everyone

[0:42:51] jessielight: yeah
[0:43:01] seanlew123: he is told to do it when its safe is the thing
[0:43:03] RonCadena92: What would Baas do?
[0:43:03] YEP46: YEP TeaTime
[0:43:08] Gnomeunknown: it’s a hobo camp. I think you should always assume people are there
[0:43:08] WasamIAm: I feel like using buffed spikes before pits would solve this.
[0:43:10] RonCadena92: :tf:
[0:43:12] Spired12: I can see why some of the PD thinks command doesnt have their backs lol
[0:43:18] modooc56: @SarahFlare nope it was robbery at gun point
[0:43:21] iJerrBear: If Johnson wasnt fired then noone would've been sued sgtaMunch
[0:43:28] seanlew123: true lol
[0:43:31] knowlightnofear: This is nuts, and i'm not even the biggest Shiesty fan.
[0:43:33] FSouza_01: I mean, Den could just have -1000 speech during the convo and talk himself into getting more daps too LULW
[0:43:36] 0zarruu: punishment for freak accidents is a bit rough, like these things happen
[0:43:43] WildWillie419: it would be penalizing freak accidents
[0:43:43] knowlightnofear: Your going to make all your officers scared of Pitting
[0:43:50] jessielight: <3 Ruby and McNulty
[0:43:53] buddha_hands: if it's a freak accident.. disciplinary action seems purely demotivating to the whole of PD, if he gets railed in court then that's a whole other thing haha
[0:43:55] seanlew123: he don't get one joshson is going to lose it
[0:44:05] RonJon: that means pay out and fuck off
[0:44:13] Leritt: giving dap for this is crazy
[0:44:13] KaIista_: This is a tough situation whatever happens
[0:44:13] jessielight: driver training!!!!
[0:44:14] knowlightnofear: This is the PROOF of why DAP's are broken
[0:44:14] Smypher: If you lose the case then make Den pay it out of his pocket
[0:44:17] Fair_Witness: The department would be liable, not the officer, if the officer was following guidelines.
[0:44:20] JennyHell: NotLikeThis  this is such a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation
[0:44:22] iJerrBear: I think it's a leadership issue, since they trained him
[0:44:23] jessielight: punish by driver training
[0:44:24] BoogieAnimal: Aziz authorized pit soooo Kappa
[0:44:26] just_james69: Damm RP be tough sometimes
[0:44:28] Zinnabunz: hush hush money NODDERS
[0:44:32] FuZroK: DAP, 1 day suspension. Then back to work.
[0:44:34] dankNbeans: he should totally be dapped, it was reckless pitting downtown, you could even see the people standing there
[0:44:35] DoctorPez: So because nobody knows ppl hang out there, he is getting a DAP for something that clearly was a misstake? He couldnt have known
[0:44:36] FizzDidThis: EZ great work recently denzel, -1 dap, +1 dap for the incident though
[0:44:39] JakoLegend118: the public cry wolf then will stab officers and do the same thing without question
[0:44:43] MacL0ven: I would wait for the court case because DAPing him right now implys guilt
[0:44:47] Satic: Public shouldn't even be aware of the DAP though
[0:44:47] windstaff54: @iJerrBear they didnt, he is skeleton crew, was hired from elsewhere
[0:44:51] dakota22446: Jigglin
[0:44:58] KaIista_: This is hard
[0:45:04] YEP46: mhm
[0:45:06] seanlew123: but chat u have to remember they all are told to do so when its safe
[0:45:08] 0zarruu: the real issue is that he is in this situation from unreasonable daps previously
[0:45:08] WildWillie419: Civil liability is a separate issue entirely, no?
[0:45:11] dankNbeans: the # of pitts in that chase was like 20+
[0:45:14] just_james69: Whatever you do I still love you Saab but a little bit less
[0:45:15] rclemon_: Is the dap for public opinion or to keep officers in check Hmmm
[0:45:20] Endjoi: the PD will be punished I don’t think he should be he’s just part of the machine in this situation
[0:45:30] nickgmiller: if nobody got hurt in the same situation would there be a dap? shouldn’t it be the process, not result, that gets judged
[0:45:30] cjohno20: that's kinda a problem, no? poor civs KEKW
[0:45:31] FSouza_01: give this man a dap too Really Mad
[0:45:33] YEP46: Prayge o cornwood baas, what would you do in this situation
[0:45:34] jessielight: to dap is to admit guilt so fight it out like McNulty said
[0:45:37] RonJon: the lawsuit shouldn't change whether you dap him or not. It should matter whether internally the PD thinks that what he did was wrong
[0:45:37] knowlightnofear: This is putting Slacks in a different light for me...and again, i'm not a shiesty fan. But its going to absolutely FUEL the toxicity that's happening in the PD
[0:45:41] RonJon: and that is separate
[0:45:48] Eddie1225: @knowlightnofear what
[0:45:49] Eddie1225: OMEGALAUGHING
[0:45:50] buddha_hands: qualified immunity should cover him if the purpose of pitting was ending the reckless driving right? if it's NOT covered, then maybe it IS DAP-worthy
[0:45:55] FizzDidThis: FeelsStrongMan mcnulty
[0:45:59] seanlew123: does it really matter who got hit someone got hurt no mater what

[0:46:25] Brasch23: one thing he is forgetting is that officers have to be held to a higher standard
[0:46:27] Gnomeunknown: this is why mcnulty isn’t high command
[0:46:32] DoctorPez: You shouldnt hand out DAPs for unfortunate events. It could technically happen literally anywhere

[0:47:08] seanlew123: what does the sop say does anyone know ???
[0:47:12] daenerhis: is there not any other punishment other than DAP?
[0:47:15] Gnomeunknown: like why would you pit in a hobo camp.
[0:47:19] just_james69: McNulty the goat
[0:48:06] dankNbeans: if he wasn't one dap away from suspension, giving him one for a pitt that resulted in civilian death wouldn't even be a question.  imo.
[0:48:07] FinexLive: mhm
[0:48:09] FizzDidThis: PauseChamp
[0:48:09] iJerrBear: @Gnomeunknown sometimes you get tunnel vision so you dont really see your surroundings
[0:48:09] SarahFlare: RUBY W
[0:48:10] jessielight: pd will crumble if good cops get tossed..the morale will crash
[0:48:11] buddha_hands: seems like a rare case where waiting for the court's outcome could make sense to inform internal stuff
[0:48:12] BoogieAnimal: GOOD POINT
[0:48:12] focustft: yeah seems like anywhere in the city is potentially dangerous for pitting
[0:48:12] FSouza_01: mhm
[0:48:13] 0zarruu: by this logic you could never pit on a corner because how do you know if anyone is standing on the corner
[0:48:14] Creep_score: facts from ruby

[0:49:21] nickgmiller: I feel like PD should judge the process, not the result
[0:49:29] RonJon: if you would you shouldn't
[0:49:32] Chaoszero_goc: McNulty sent someone off a bridge

[0:49:52] DoctorPez: @Artsii1994 People can move anywhere they want though, you could technically pit someone in the desert and still hit a civillian

[0:51:40] knowlightnofear: @angus1794 somehow
[0:51:42] urkuri92: saabDap
[0:51:43] WasamIAm: Give him the suspension, and then let him back in once the daps would have fallen off.
[0:51:45] Kevz95: idk. if everyone thinks it was a safe pit at the time and ended in a freak accident, its gonna end with every cop questioning their pits. shiesty or not.
[0:51:45] YEP46: o7 den suspended o7 lost to waffle fries incoming o7 gone for 2 weeks

[0:52:18] Spired12: rip shift 1
[0:52:19] magnets_: SOPs aren't based on public perception though
[0:52:20] Satic: PD discipline should stay internal
[0:52:22] DoctorPez: Other than like the super hotspots, there is no way to anticipate where ppl will be at any given time
[0:52:26] iJerrBear: Protecting your image instead of protecting your officers is what causes morale to go down
[0:52:29] Stryfe_81: They PD takes the punishment, not the officer.
[0:52:32] jessielight: that's why leadership is so flippin hard..Slacks has to consider both
[0:52:42] Satic: Need that PR Officer to spin it for you to the public
[0:52:44] Mouso9: The law is already set up to allow people to be hit on purpose. Why would it be a big deal when it's an accident....
[0:52:45] Fair_Witness: Not if he was following guidelines, accidents can happen anywhere, the department would change guidelines if needed, but not guaranteed if it's a freak accident.
[0:52:45] angus1794: if this is a dap, we are arguing way too many semantics
[0:52:51] ManySadPandas: The PIT was approved knowing that it was a city chase though, yeah?

[0:53:17] YEP46: WideAmongUsGaySex
[0:53:17] Kevz95: yeah, but firing a second cop in the same week is also gonna make the police look bad. if we're talking politics, no? cant control their cops kinda thing.. ?

[0:54:39] Fair_Witness: In the real world Denzel would sue the department, for punishing him even tho he followed guidelines. And he could argue they tried to make an example out of him because of public opinion.
[0:54:40] Krimson07_: Tomfoolery

[1:03:58] BoogieAnimal: 1 dap = no more pitting or fear of pitting for all officers
[1:04:01] cjohno20: It's good to have reasons to consider whether or not to pit
[1:04:01] RodgersMMA: id agree with no daps if civs got hit by cops cars on a daily but they dont
[1:04:02] Mouso9: There are laws that effectively let a civilian walk you and block a cop car during a chase. Yet if u accidently hit them and its a big deal?
[1:04:02] dankNbeans: 1 dap seems reasonable, it's simply too bad that denzel already has like 8

[1:05:45] MacL0ven: I think you need to use blocks of road that you cant Pit not just locations
[1:05:46] dakota22446: wideduckass
[1:05:47] doza107: that shouldnt matter tbh
[1:05:49] SilentStormAU: 3 is a crowd Isn't there a new policy ? u can run ththrough a crowd LUL
[1:05:49] FinexLive: I think the sop's need to be modified, pit at lower speed, in smaller roads
[1:05:50] Hillbilly_Hxck: if that’s the case, Suarez is soooo fired soon LUL
[1:05:53] magnets_: but is "unsafe" pit only based on people getting hurt?
[1:05:53] cjohno20: Punishments shouldn't be results-oriented to be fair. It's the action that matters
[1:05:54] ITZxJeff: guys take primary ive got too many daps
[1:05:58] RonJon: the outcome of two people taking the same exact action shouldn't have different consequences that is so stupid
[1:06:01] SilentStormAU: Drive
[1:06:03] DonNiko99: Remember what month it is and the optics monkaEyes
[1:06:09] YEP46: mhm time to go to the graveyard and seeking the answer
[1:06:11] judgement_12: I do think retraining would be something that could presented to the public as the consequence of the lawsuit, which would cover public image
[1:06:14] keat1227: deansoFish deansoFish
[1:06:15] angus1794: if someone doesn't get hurt there, no one will talk about that pit ever again
[1:06:17] nickgmiller: PD not a casino. PD shouldn’t don’t punish people for being unlucky
[1:06:18] seanlew123: who agree slacks should just give it ?
[1:06:28] ForgottenJones: Den is really Beta testing the S.O.P.s
[1:06:31] seanlew123: he still did wrong and needs to get one
[1:06:33] smokeyyy990: but there will always be injuries involved when a pit is involved
[1:06:34] Moobot: Thank you for subbing, RodgersMMA! Welcome to the Saabscribers! saabH

[1:06:50] RodgersMMA: <3
[1:06:50] Nerdversity: yep, and no one will pit, pd looks more weak lol, good call ruby
[1:06:51] Fair_Witness: Ruby W.
[1:06:54] doza107: she's right
[1:06:55] Nitewinds: You can't dap someone for breaking a rule that didn't exist prior to the incident, it's just crazy
[1:06:55] Artsii1994: ok i see rubys point
[1:06:56] Dirk_Richter: Gonna Dap for hitting locals?
[1:07:01] WildWillie419: if he did the right thing and gets punished, I don’t get it
[1:07:01] topher554411: I mean that a given to stop if you cause some one harm right?
[1:07:02] 0zarruu: its such a bad precedent to set
[1:07:06] YEP46: FeelsStrongMan Clap thats our pd mom
[1:07:06] Kevz95: Drake ruby
[1:07:10] cbrooks51: you got spikes dont have to pit at all
[1:07:10] Fair_Witness: Exactly.
[1:07:12] Sohaib_arshad31: If they give no Daps then it’ll set a precedent for the future that cops can accidentally pit civilians on the sidewalk.
[1:07:14] smokeyyy990: so will officers be daped if they pit a car and the person in the car gets injured
[1:07:14] seanlew123: the min he gets nothing all players are going to say the officers go away with something else
[1:07:17] Nitewinds: Ruby's the voice of reason
[1:07:17] FizzDidThis: ruby ult
[1:07:18] BoogieAnimal: Slacks being really stubborn on this point even though great points are being brought up
[1:07:21] DoctorPez: Ruby needs a promotion
[1:07:22] jessielight: I think the whole dap system needs trashed and redone to be honest
[1:07:25] RodgersMMA: hung up on it being johnson and den rather then a civ being hurt imo
[1:07:26] Shakestar: You could barely see the civs when the pit happened
[1:07:28] Marthentic: Ruby my Snr Ofc o7
[1:07:30] impanda0: ruby for captain
[1:07:32] Eddie1225: yall saying this
[1:07:32] hereforff9: DAPs for that brah?
[1:07:32] cjohno20: the point is to value civilian life. hitting a civilian with a car shouldn't be shrugged off as an annoyance KEKW
[1:07:38] Eddie1225: but if was anyone else besides den
[1:07:38] Kevz95: with johnson, everyone seemed 50/50. with this. its everyone v slacks KEKW
[1:07:40] BoogieAnimal: Im learning a lot about Slacks the character
[1:07:43] Eddie1225: yall would be fine with the dap
[1:07:44] Eddie1225: OMEGALAUGHING
[1:07:58] imnotyourdude: If it were anyone but den I feel like this wouldn't even be being discussed tbh
[1:08:01] no0b_l0l: LUL
[1:08:03] Kevz95: @Eddie1225 nah, same shit. dapping for a freak accident when we have all seniors saying they would have done the same. no dap NOPERS
[1:08:04] RonJon: i wouldn't be okay with anyone getting dapped fora pit like this
[1:08:05] RonJon: ever
[1:08:07] RonJon: i promise
[1:08:07] Nitewinds: Nah I wouldn't, but there should be a measure of thought for the fact that it's a career ending dap
[1:08:09] YEP46: o7
[1:08:14] RonJon: same with mcnulty
[1:08:16] seanlew123: you are right they would just get it
[1:08:17] ForgottenJones: classic
[1:08:21] spicyville: tbh if this weren’t shiesty it probably would have been a dap I think
[1:08:24] jessielight: daps are not getting the results of making better cops its make paranoid, hesitant bitter cops.how is that good?
[1:08:25] BulletGorilla: I believe its on the driver of the car committing the crime
[1:08:30] lora1969: aziz monkaS
[1:08:34] Gygosan: people have to remember slacks sister was killed by car, so he is going to have a tough stance
[1:08:42] ForgottenJones: EZ Clap
[1:08:43] msdeell: dap
[1:08:45] seanlew123: true
[1:08:49] c0rnishatheart: @Gygosan exactly
[1:08:49] Xellwrath: How are PD supposed to predict if some random bozo is standing behind a corner coming at 70-80mph? This dap is absolutely insane. Literally nobody will pit in the city if this dap goes through.
[1:08:49] Moobot: Thank you for subbing, sensualwombat! Welcome to the Saabscribers! saabH
[1:08:53] sensualwombat: sensualwombat subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:08:54] dakota22446: I think you should hire johnson back and fire him again for this situation
[1:08:59] BoogieAnimal: Even if it was someone else the issues of fear of pitting for daps is still there @Eddie1225
[1:08:59] VincentsDeath: if there is a need for a dap shouldn't it go to the one who authorized it? like when Slacks dapped himself when Cornwood shot the hostage
[1:09:04] KaIista_: @dakota22446 mhm

[1:09:11] xsgem01: Guys
[1:09:16] topher554411: Then dont dap and give him some course for fun. He gets some punishment but doesn't get a dap
[1:09:22] YEP46: @dakota22446 DonkBased
[1:09:25] BoogieAnimal: @dakota22446 NODDERS
[1:09:26] seanlew123: i disagree he should get one they are told to do the pit when its safe and there was more then just him standing there
[1:09:42] jukla12: @dakota22446 well, if he wasnt fired, he wouldnt be there at the homeless camp, its slacks fault!! KEKW
[1:09:44] DoctorPez: I agree with pretty much all DAPs Den has recieved, but if he gets a DAP for this then officers should just stop doing pits all together, too risky
[1:09:56] sensualwombat: Doing a pit in the city at 85mph seems wild
[1:09:56] doza107: city of los santos should go on lockdown whenever a pursuit happens
[1:10:07] magnets_: Classic
[1:10:10] ForgottenJones: oop
[1:10:12] Artsii1994: @dakota22446 slacks should be fired and jhonson should take his place has captian and sue slacks
[1:10:14] SarahFlare: @DoctorPez I think that will be the sentiment if that happens.
[1:10:15] Spired12: thats the way they've been dealt with, makes sense they would be defensive
