[0:57:06] OzzyTheArchitect: #BringBackSoze
[0:57:13] Markzyy: i can see the idea they wanted, slow recruitment and only take the good ones and thats going to take longer, but this is snail pace
[0:57:16] shanef8: They sacked like 3/4 more cops pass 3 days
[0:57:18] ALK1RO: their recruitment is a very slow process
[0:57:19] bigflex601: Facts
