[0:51:33] CrAzYMaYnE: DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance
[0:51:46] Nitrostealth: Everyone needs mats and no one is selling/farming for themselves. Demand is insanely high and supply is very low, spikes may prices
[0:51:52] Nitrostealth: Mat prices*
[0:52:26] Nitrostealth: That was more for the guy asking how mat prices are so high vs 3.0
[0:52:34] xyz83: but 12 per is insane
[0:52:43] xyz83: 10 at most

[0:54:02] BinkyLea: aka :Lang
[0:54:19] Nitrostealth: But no one is doing that because of greed from the sounds of it

[0:54:45] xyz83: he was the one that pushed it up

[0:54:51] Nitrostealth: He does but doesn't do it LUL
[0:54:54] Torrok: Suspect that you keep losing stills, especially after that phone call yesterday

[0:56:10] Nitrostealth: Idk feels like super greed to me
[0:56:22] Nitrostealth: 10-12 per is insane I agree
[0:56:34] AskDazed: I dont know much about moonshine. How much do you make off it?
[0:56:34] BitShifting: But is it really a market when you can farm a job and get mats + money. You don't need to do anything other than Sani
[0:57:02] Nitrostealth: Wait.. aren't the civ jobs technically state owned? Since you get a paycheck?
[0:57:12] xyz83: 12 per is just going to make mat runers extremely rich plus no expense for doing runs
[0:57:13] Kkaedal: The thing I don't understand and Ramee pointed out is why people joined his union when he doesn't offer added benefits and buys them for less
[0:57:34] Nitrostealth: The council could come in and regulate it if they choose
[0:57:50] AskDazed: @xyz83 yes but more trucks will get robbed
[0:57:55] Nitrostealth: Yeah for sure
[0:58:07] Kkaedal: But he makes a profit on his union guys I think
[0:58:37] Nitrostealth: Idk about recently but lang was buying for 6-7 per and selling for 9-10
[0:58:44] brentvargas: yeh but with everyone needing bc it'll never happen prob
[0:59:07] Kkaedal: The problem is everyone turns them into circuit board for themselves or to sale, you need to make the rest more important
[0:59:13] xyz83: k said lang is basically  extorting the union ppl
[0:59:25] CrAzYMaYnE: Today will tell it all

[1:01:01] NoxintheBox: You would think the market should level out after civs get gun licenses and can defend themselves during sani runs.
[1:01:05] Nitrostealth: I mean there are options with Butcoin. Selling it right now is insanely profitable if people are willing to buy
[1:01:18] Nitrostealth: But then content gets thrown out the window

[1:03:55] Kkaedal: I get the "investigation" but why that applies only to lawyers but not civilians with clean records and no evidence and he was gsr negative, I'd like to see K or his lawyers argue that when he founds out

[1:07:46] TheBigSteve31: Gomer is a rail road bum now?
[1:07:53] BitShifting: Imo, K's case is more about the fact that PD preemptively assigned guilt. Without investigating his RP reason for the gun (i.e. possibly planted).
[1:08:02] CrAzYMaYnE: Lol
[1:08:12] Ozryal: @krustymcdoogle I thought they brought him in... let him go.... then arrested him the next day in the station while doing police work?
