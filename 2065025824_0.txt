[2:24:57] lorddracnor: ok, I was typing that before you said it
[2:25:15] doc_sharon: yeah, but to be fair, Summer likes to katesStir KEKW
[2:25:26] Kthanid: Yeah neither party has changed their attitude or had their judgement affected.
[2:25:38] AshuraX13: Plus that's not really a chapter thing, yeah
[2:25:51] laxwall11: It would have been during Grime
[2:25:52] abblepiewit: And Maxx has been with Lane twice (on Grime) so there's been chance to stir already.
[2:25:52] Kthanid: Summer has said she wants to stir more OUTSIDE the club as well.
[2:26:00] VTMonster: There's more chance of the Bev Valentine to have stirring come from it, and that's just to torment Bev
[2:26:09] abblepiewit: True
[2:26:11] A_Humble_Wooper: Yeah, I think if Lane was going to bring it up today she would have done it while she and Maxx were doing Grime earlier.
[2:26:23] IchibaToll: Well, that, and. let's face it, Tom's the easier target.
[2:26:31] Kthanid: Yeah she might get a bit cheeky with Maxx, but not stir.

[2:32:13] AziraphalesShop: Are you specifically picking the chopper style bikes?
[2:32:25] if0rg0t2remember: dislike that it says The Lost by default
[2:32:29] rickbuh: I think the Lost seat is the only option too
[2:32:33] Symbiotic1: yeah chopper style azira
[2:32:37] Siirika: Not without test driving it into Bennies no
[2:32:38] mister_nibbles: i believe the lost marked bikes are off limits

[2:34:45] lorddracnor: Don't need to overthink it, this is Maxx's FIRST motorcycle.
[2:34:46] if0rg0t2remember: its the big cruiser with a small fairing and large cargo bags on it
[2:35:11] Symbiotic1: can always sell it to a prospect and get a new one
[2:36:37] sandrabullock__: i think so too
[2:36:45] sandrabullock__: the quiet is concerning
[2:36:48] mister_nibbles: im getting the vibe that both tom and wally are
[2:36:50] Siirika: Vibes feel wierdly off for ... some reason?
[2:37:01] A_Humble_Wooper: katesPlot
[2:37:13] lorddracnor: Maybe it's a comfortable silence?
[2:37:32] UppyFF: Wally is the vibe maker and he’s being punished so vibe output is low?
[2:37:36] A_Humble_Wooper: Maybe comfortable for some but not others?
[2:37:42] doc_sharon: it's a big contrast to the energy the club has had lately NODDERS
[2:37:44] lorddracnor: Yes? Maybe you are just worried
[2:37:46] mohler_47: everyone was very quiet for all of chapter and didn’t come out of it
[2:37:52] AshuraX13: Plus there was that moment where Lane seemed not ok right before Chapter
[2:37:54] sandrabullock__: i couldn't tell if everyone was just taking a break or if something was happening lol
[2:37:57] Hoocairz: With Maxx's history? Maybe.
[2:38:04] UppyFF: yeah someone needs to break the chapter quietness
[2:38:09] SetraLynn: Lane also good vibes usually, but she's a bit off. And Rue just got back so not quite back in stride.
[2:38:10] Pleasantmsp: is the silence uncomfortable or do i just have anxiety?? - a question i ask myself all the time
[2:38:50] sandrabullock__: pleasant so real

[2:56:31] itGlenn: we were the leader of CG YEP
[2:56:34] laxwall11: I would say Southside due to the size of the area
[2:57:04] Siirika: Southside also seems more staggered then LS which was just a single wall of FREEZE
[2:57:14] Kthanid: I just do the holding breath thing for as long as possible.
[2:57:20] laxwall11: Drinking upside down always worked for me
[2:57:24] Julianhj1: The way I always fix my friends is asking them to hiccup for me and it makes her self concious
[2:57:27] Siirika: Well for everyone but you : P
[2:57:42] AshuraX13: I've heard all the things to get rid of hiccups, they are all placebos and they truly just stop when they stop
[2:57:51] rickbuh: there is just way too much in the Southside with mosely's, city hall, sewers, hospital, etc
[2:58:15] itGlenn: HUHH
[2:58:47] SetraLynn: The only thing that works for hiccups for me is to get a glass of water and drink it as slowly as possible, breathing in and out through my nose. I think it's just the way I taught my body to control breathing.
[2:58:56] hecktobreakfast: katesSmile
[2:58:59] AshuraX13: So Fupa?

[3:05:25] Pleasantmsp: I'll always remember when my algebra teacher stopped the class while we were doing a worksheet to correct a group of boys who were saying the 'that's so gay' Asking them why they were saying that and telling them why they shouldn't. It was iconic. Best math teacher I've ever had honestly. I'm good at algebra and geometry bc of him
[3:05:25] lorddracnor: oh hell no!!!
[3:05:35] SetraLynn: Confirm that I also heard the Marilyn Manson rumor in Colorado around 2000/2001.
