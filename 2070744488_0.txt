[4:09:58] AzureMarquis: and he raided all her shit
[4:10:09] AzureMarquis: Plus all her clients shit she had keys to design for

[4:10:33] TPLivewire: Adept in big big trouble
[4:10:35] michaael_g: I could be wrong
[4:10:44] winter__st0rm: Adept situation was the Big JCJ Chain raid

[4:10:59] AzureMarquis: KEKW
[4:11:54] AzureMarquis: I know it was someone wrangler raided
[4:12:12] AzureMarquis: Perma'd and they looked at his bank and he gave it all away and it said "one last deathroll:
[4:12:18] winter__st0rm: @AzureMarquis I was pretty sure that was Bloom's pump.
[4:12:23] z3r0f14m3: suggestions channel for that one
[4:12:25] winter__st0rm: I remember Bloom ranting about it to someone
[4:12:28] z3r0f14m3: cause that would be great
[4:12:31] Arbal3st: slash me destroys evidence
[4:12:33] UltimateMcNasty: How do gas pumps work? I'm from Oregon.

[4:13:00] AzureMarquis: They don't pump gas in Oregon
[4:13:04] AzureMarquis: they have attendants
[4:13:04] z3r0f14m3: Oregon is one of those weird states
[4:13:05] Arbal3st: they do not
[4:13:05] TPLivewire: Oregon doesn't pump their own gas
[4:13:06] Explorer_ini: jep
[4:13:08] middy_92: do they not pump gas there?
[4:13:08] theblazinwzn: you shoot them at the other customers like water guns
[4:13:10] michaael_g: Oregon and Jersey

[4:15:37] UltimateMcNasty: Thanks OG
[4:15:41] friggarn: wtf is gas bro, I just plug in at home
[4:15:42] Drivont: It's great except most of the pumps I encounter are missing the dangly clip thing
[4:15:45] Vooklife: oh yeah i forgot those still exist in the south
[4:15:53] Vooklife: those have been gone for 20 years up here
[4:16:00] z3r0f14m3: super broke is feathering it to just be a couple of bucks
[4:16:08] AzureMarquis: @TPLivewire Sounds like Skill issue
[4:16:12] AzureMarquis: or crippling medical debt
[4:16:26] zara1024: I heard you guys in the US have to pay for gas before you pump it, so you kinda just have to guess how much you'll need. is that true??
[4:16:38] AzureMarquis: @zara1024 only inside
[4:16:41] TPLivewire: Super broke is raiding your change jars and the floors and glove box of your car and go inside to prepay with your change
[4:16:43] AzureMarquis: if you use your card it just pumps
[4:16:47] Bowes0: @zara1024 That's if you do cash
[4:17:00] Vooklife: Zara, i know upside down world doesnt have credit cards yet, but comeon
[4:17:01] AzureMarquis: Never had to do that
[4:17:20] Chunko_Muffo: Super broke is going out of gas and abandoning your car at an Arby's parking lot you were passing by
[4:17:23] zara1024: @Vooklife we were using chip and pin cards while you guys were trading rocks
[4:17:25] UltimateMcNasty: @AzureMarquis Not true. I just had to pre-pay with a credit card on my way home from work
[4:17:27] AzureMarquis: Is that even a legal parkign spot
[4:17:39] middy_92: if you pay cash?
[4:17:39] Warjec: you just fill your tank
[4:17:42] Explorer_ini: ???
[4:17:47] TPLivewire: Other countries do that though Moose, they let you fill your tank and then you pay
[4:17:49] AzureMarquis: @UltimateMcNasty Oh well thats in your strange state, you can put your card in and let it go in most normal states
[4:17:50] Warjec: it stops pumping when its full
[4:17:59] Vooklife: you just go back in and get your change
[4:18:02] Vooklife: how are you people alive
[4:18:07] AzureMarquis: LITERS

[4:18:09] UltimateMcNasty: @AzureMarquis #WestCoastBestCoast
[4:18:14] AzureMarquis: WTF IS A LITER YOU COMMIE SON OF A BITCH
[4:18:22] AzureMarquis: @UltimateMcNasty I live in Arizona
[4:18:23] Arbal3st: what if I told you...there was a time when they didn't take cards? @Warjec
[4:18:24] TPLivewire: What?
[4:18:24] AzureMarquis: HELLO
[4:18:26] Hotot1: @tplivewire it switched away from that in the US, in the 80s everywhre was like that
[4:18:27] AzureMarquis: GALLONS
[4:18:39] Warjec: 35 years ago?
[4:18:43] middy_92: wait it isn't gallons?
[4:18:49] TPLivewire: @Hotot1 Well neither myself or Moose were alive in the 80s
[4:18:49] AzureMarquis: it is Gallons
[4:18:51] AzureMarquis: KEKL
[4:18:56] friggarn: it's x.xx 9/10ths
[4:18:58] Warjec: i was talking to the guy who said credit cards dont exist
[4:19:00] friggarn: money
[4:19:01] cbrownnu: Good ole fashioned being 16 and trying to hit 20 bucks on the nose
[4:19:15] melodicspell: Isn't there a code you enter into the numpad and can set a specific dollar amount?
[4:19:18] Arbal3st: credit cards existed, most gas stations didn't take them
[4:19:25] Hotot1: @tplivewire you could still pump and then pay most places during the 90s im saying it was a slow shift and now nowhere
[4:19:39] Vooklife: are you all dumb
[4:19:43] Amocoru: @Hotot1 This is true for sure
[4:19:45] Vooklife: thats 9/10th of a cent on pricing
[4:19:50] Chunko_Muffo: Gas is more with credit
[4:19:51] Lurks_like_Gaston: The 9/10's on a sign is cents not gallons
[4:19:51] Vooklife: not 9/10ths of a gallon
[4:19:52] Chunko_Muffo: Yean
[4:19:52] friggarn: the 9/10ths is a cent for price, not the gallon
[4:19:54] AzureMarquis: @Vooklife Thank you
[4:19:55] AzureMarquis: KEKW
[4:19:56] z3r0f14m3: my first car cost 15 bucks to fill from empty. good ol days
[4:20:06] kily200: im paying 5$ a gallon fml
[4:20:10] middy_92: ohhh that's what you mean
[4:20:13] EpsilonB3: 9/10ths of a gallon like 3.5 is liters
[4:20:14] AzureMarquis: KEKL
[4:20:17] Arbal3st: It's also why you couldn't buy gas with a check, if that shit bounces you just got the gas for nothing
[4:20:21] jdskye: I thought it was 9/10 od a cent but I was too lazy to correct it
[4:20:26] TPLivewire: It's 3.30 for premium here
[4:20:31] kily200: LA aint it dawg
[4:20:39] middy_92: nah it's .9 cents for whatever pricing bull shit comparisons
[4:20:50] TPLivewire: I have to do premium for my car
[4:20:54] brittanany_: cheapest gas here is 3.25
[4:20:57] Warjec: the .9 is from the 1930s when gas was 10 cents a gallon
[4:21:00] Explorer_ini: only 102 octan
[4:21:01] masterarkaine: $3.40-3.70 gal here in Central Oregon
[4:21:01] jdskye: I had a car that required premium
[4:21:21] UltimateMcNasty: I had to fill diesel in Canada for work, I was so confused. They advertise their fuel at like 139 cents per liter.
[4:21:24] Vooklife: Look what you made me do, im agreeing with Warjec
[4:21:29] Vooklife: i hate myself rn
[4:21:36] TPLivewire: I'm glad I don't have my truck anymore though
[4:21:38] Warjec: you should hate yourself cause youre a weeb anywayt
[4:21:48] TPLivewire: Paying for diesel sucked
[4:21:56] Amocoru: AYAYA
[4:22:09] brittanany_: mbroStare
[4:22:18] TPLivewire: Which is funny because Diesel is more expensive, but is cheaper to make
[4:22:22] Vooklife: how would you possibly know if thats true
[4:22:31] jdskye: @TPLivewire trucker tax
[4:22:56] TPLivewire: @jdskye Not wrong
