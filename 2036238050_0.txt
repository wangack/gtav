[1:29:47] wookie_shampoo: that car is a sovereign citizen
[1:29:50] Zac_NZ: hes allowed to take inventory because its being impounded for illedgal parking
[1:30:03] nivada94: @will_s21 The car was wrongly parked and had papers of the owner in it
[1:30:04] grannyhipster: NOT ME but... Within UK law nothing ever is really abandoned. It's left with a purpose. It BS for old police to arrest dumpster divers
[1:30:06] 50_tiger: will you can argue the spirit of the law of taking inventory when a vehicle is towed
[1:30:06] Kawllin: @will_s21 we're waiting. Explain please
[1:30:09] A_DeviousHawk: Bro you made me worried that there were no cops u got like 5 at least kyleisHands
[1:30:10] SuperTrolllol: @will_s21 The only W for Cops here is the dumbfuck that wasn't able to park legally in an almost empty parking lot
[1:30:10] SencneS: @will_s21 There was a report of suspicious activity, and a car with smashed windows parked illegally..

[1:30:21] RobOnTheMic1: like 3 feet away from an actual parking space PEPW so close to not being searched
[1:30:24] will_s21: imagine questioning something and just having the whole chat attack.. hahaha
[1:30:25] Azureburn: @will_s21 you're getting cause and effect backwards I think.  Why do they need to know who owns it before they can search it?
[1:30:28] JoCheah: @will_s21 It doesn't matter who's car it is it's illegally parked therefore it should be towed and searched
[1:30:33] PoorMamaAde: It's not searching, it's an 'inventory' of vehicle contents to make sure there isn't a bomb or something
[1:30:38] jonahAlexandur: you dont have to imagine at all

[1:31:09] EvilPandaEmpire: if owner is not around and car is illeagly parked. it is with in the rights of the officer to search the car for information about the owner anything found in the serch can be used as evidence
[1:31:10] kennyhavoc: pentawATTACK
[1:31:12] DoaK_PT: @JoCheah not searched beacuse without a key you would be breaking the car to get in but since it has a broken window ...
[1:31:12] nivada94: @will_s21 Imagine asking a dumb question while you could easily have gone back a few minutes in the video if you only just arrived now, to see why it was searched
[1:31:12] octodaddy: If I'm going to be honest with you. In my own humble opinion without being sentimental of course, without offending anyone who thinks differently from my own point of view, but also by looking into this matter in distinctive perspective, I would like to say I have nothing to say.

[2:06:44] jgunns68: You can't get a warrant?
[2:06:50] Turbul_: @exoosia in my mind its kinda like sending a trolly message. its meant to grab attention. you can have a one viewer raid either just yourself or maybe an alt account. it stands out. people self promo for some reason even though it doesnt make sense
