[1:27:40] A_Humble_Wooper: NODDERS
[1:27:46] Kthanid: It also means you don't have to worry about not making "enough" on EMS as well with repairs etc.

[1:28:16] IchibaToll: That's what I figured.  So between V and Maxx, your characters put in more than what Reggie did on the Paleto house, and he was grinding a ton.  That's a ton of work on your end, awesome to see it all pay off.
[1:28:37] if0rg0t2remember: Riaders spent a ton of group funds on weed though too

[2:15:15] 1Joeysmith: WHATT, that
[2:15:19] vegasbrent: Huh
[2:15:22] 1Joeysmith: that's the only reason why i drink it
[2:15:30] Kthanid: Yep, which is why they reclassified some versions of Mtn Dew as an "Energy Drink"
[2:15:31] chickeneer: HUHH
[2:15:31] doc_sharon: do you even have Baja Blast? katesHm
[2:15:32] fattydelrey: our clear liquids aren't allowed to have caffeine
[2:15:37] 1Joeysmith: yeah
[2:15:39] BfAleTitan: that is the case in a couple countries
[2:15:43] if0rg0t2remember: that is pretty much the main draw of Mt Dew I thought, lots of caffeine but isn't cola
[2:15:52] TheRealZed11: it does now. the bottle I have next to me has 103mg of caffeine.
[2:15:55] archdevils_: Wait, what???
[2:15:55] Kthanid: All caffinated sodas in Canada HAVE to be opaque.
[2:15:56] GenuineMind: WAIT WHAT?
[2:15:56] vegasbrent: But caffeine is what mountain dew is known for
[2:16:03] mister_nibbles: here's some bonus trivia, do you know that Mountain Dew is primarily orange flavored?
[2:16:05] firefrye: In US it's one of THE MOST caffeinated sodas
[2:16:09] traviebear: mountain dew had an energy drink in canada for a bit is was sold in tall boys
[2:16:18] Ponscus: caffeine free mountain dew exists in the parts of the states
[2:16:20] onyx_kl: Mountain dew is like a staple drink in my states I'm almost for sure it started in my state where I live
[2:16:23] darkjester316: mountain dew in Canada 100% has Caffeine
[2:16:42] mister_nibbles: Mountain Dew was also originally invented to be a whisky mixer
[2:16:50] Nightbot: Follow Kate on Instagram! instagram.com/kate.ttv
[2:16:59] brainbosh: I heard they have added an "Energy Drink" version that is just american mtn dew
[2:17:00] 1Joeysmith: @kate IM JEALOUS YOU GUYS HAVE SNACK WRAPS AT MCDONALDS
[2:17:04] TheRealZed11: they changed the rules for Canada. I’m in Ottawa and I’m drinking Mountain Dew right now. 103mg of caffeine.
[2:17:22] if0rg0t2remember: maybe its per province then?
[2:17:28] vegasbrent: @brainbosh They have an alcoholic version too
[2:17:36] TheRealZed11: purchased from Shopper’s Drug Mart. it’s fairly recent I think.
[2:17:42] Henshini: the rule used to be that transparent beverages couldn’t have caffeine
[2:17:45] TheOriginalNoobGamer: mountain dew was banned in uk for a long time
[2:17:49] traviebear: i'ma check i think i have 1 in the fridge
[2:17:51] GenuineMind: i was gonna say, i have never heard of this in canada
[2:18:03] Thorn104: how does that explain Sprite and 7Up then?
[2:18:12] paullt2: lol
[2:18:12] Ponscus: is green clear though?
[2:18:13] doc_sharon: sprite and 7 up are caffeine free
[2:18:23] if0rg0t2remember: that's confusing though, since Coca-Cola isn't opaque
[2:18:36] brainbosh: Yeah those are caffeine free in the states too
[2:18:43] brainbosh: Coke is tho?
[2:18:43] MyNameisTiff_: It's brown.
[2:18:43] if0rg0t2remember: Mt Dew isn't clear either
[2:18:44] TheOriginalNoobGamer: brown
[2:18:46] if0rg0t2remember: its yellow
[2:18:51] Thorn104: @doc_sharon are they? damn, never knew xD
[2:18:51] Henshini: it’s more opaque. like everything, it’s a spectrum
[2:18:52] GenuineMind: Opaque: not able to be seen through; not transparent.
[2:19:03] Kthanid: Chat, you're being VERY nit-picky. It's SODA.
[2:19:06] mister_nibbles: i feel like chat is getting a little pedantic
[2:19:11] doc_sharon: chat, its not that deep
[2:19:29] lorddracnor: it's good
[2:19:31] GenuineMind: IT IS THAT DEEP! katesGiggle
[2:19:33] Immortal_Sin: do we not like spice?
[2:19:36] 1Joeysmith: I thought Rockstar Energy Drink had to do with, Rockstar Games it doesn't HAHA
[2:19:38] Immortal_Sin: ahhhh
[2:19:41] Henshini: jolt cola was banned in Canada for its high caffeine content
[2:19:42] mister_nibbles: i tried it once, its "fine" but its definitely over hyped
[2:19:43] Immortal_Sin: i LOVE spice
[2:19:51] lorddracnor: that's the comercial lol
[2:19:58] GenuineMind: a little saracha will do ya
[2:20:01] Thorn104: Saracha is nice, but Tabassco will always be a go to for me
[2:20:04] TPRJones: @Henshini I drank so much Jolt in college.  I bet I'd hate it now.
[2:20:07] Immortal_Sin: and HIIII chatloaf and kate
[2:20:08] mister_nibbles: franks is my go to
[2:20:11] doc_sharon: yeah Frank's slogan is "I put that shit on everything" KEKW
[2:20:17] Ponscus: i've never had sriracha. not a spice person
[2:20:33] if0rg0t2remember: Cholula is my Franks. I put it on everything
[2:20:46] TPRJones: Palo Alto Firefighter's Sauce is the one I recommend for everything.  Delicious!  And charitable.
[2:20:48] paullt2: Cholula and Tapatillo are my go-tos
[2:20:52] AdventurousEmma: yes cholula on top
[2:20:55] FlameReetardantPanda: not me looking over at the chalula, sriracha, local green sauce, and a hot ones pack next to me...
[2:21:00] fattydelrey: hot sauce is specific spice i do not like
[2:21:02] Immortal_Sin: @if0rg0t2remember yesss
[2:21:03] spazzles: I like sriracha, but I like other hot sauces better.  my go-to is Tapatio
[2:21:16] lorddracnor: yeah
[2:21:25] kangg: I used to enjoy Mountain Dew in my youth but not anymore
[2:21:25] OutlandAsh: sriracha is my go to sauce when I dont have my ghost pepper sauce
[2:21:32] lorddracnor: you would like siracha, yeah
[2:21:33] Crafty_Crystal: never even had it in pho?
[2:21:48] firefrye: I don't like hot sauce where the flavor is "pain"
[2:21:51] TheRealZed11: apparently the rule changed sometime around 2010. apparently related to Scottish beverage IRN-BRU. Red Bull isn’t opaque either.
[2:21:56] jordiemac3: I love sambal
[2:21:58] Immortal_Sin: thats WAY spicier than sriracha
[2:22:02] TPRJones: I have multiple spreadsheets tracking what hot sauces I have, have had, and will be having, and their spice levels and flavor profiles.  It might be I have a problem.
[2:22:07] firefrye: Siracha is mainly heat and sugar... so I don't like it
[2:22:12] FlameReetardantPanda: that's why I hate tabasco, it's just hot, nothing else.
[2:22:26] spazzles: tabasco is spicy vinegar.  it's the worst
[2:22:28] if0rg0t2remember: both sriracha and gochujang are fermented hot sauces so I think you'd vibe
[2:22:32] BfAleTitan: i found a gochujang bbq sauce that is amazing
[2:22:36] Floxxxie: @jordiemac3 Same!
[2:22:41] JovanMaxis: My roommate just had a recipe for a gochujang sugar cookie that was really complex and interesting. 10/10, gochujang is great. Sweet and spicy was fantastic
[2:22:47] firefrye: where I am, I need to buy the Mexican hot sauces to get decent flavor
[2:22:47] Kthanid: Heat for the sake of heat isn't my thing.
[2:22:48] Fracaswell: i'm not a fan of vinegary hot sauces, it doesn't taste good to me
[2:23:03] traviebear: For a good hot with flavor with tacos is the presidents choice black label chipotle
[2:23:24] Immortal_Sin: SO good
[2:23:32] FlameReetardantPanda: I need to get my hands on some gochugaru powder for sauce making.
[2:23:38] Immortal_Sin: ya know what I love... the chili onion crunch from trader joes
[2:23:39] AdventurousEmma: I will say I put chili crip on eeeverything
[2:23:44] shamgar600: sriracha is similar to gochujang, both fermented pepper sauce. sriracha is just a little less thick, a bit hotter, and garlicky.
[2:23:46] AdventurousEmma: crisp*

[2:24:52] shamgar600: chili crisp is best hot maker

[2:25:29] AdventurousEmma: oh it's really nice
[2:25:37] shamgar600: that stuff is good, overpriced tho
[2:25:40] Insaif: I would love to try most of those sauces for the flavor, just without all the heat.
[2:25:45] doc_sharon: yeah that's too much for me KEKW
[2:25:47] lorddracnor: yeah, that's weird
[2:25:48] if0rg0t2remember: Franks and Tobasco are so vinegary I don't love em
[2:25:55] FlameReetardantPanda: franks/crystal I just use for making buffalo things.
[2:26:03] OutlandAsh: I put sriracha on everything lmao
[2:26:11] firefrye: "But Kate! Pain is a seasoning!" Kappa
[2:26:16] TPRJones: Tabasco 150th Anniversary Diamond Reserve is my ultimate sauce.  Made with champaign vinegar and barrel aged for 15 years.  A very fruity and sharp flavor profile.  I spent over $200 for my last bottle.  I am sad I will never experience it again.
[2:26:23] AshuraX13: It's about the flavor, not just the heat Yesyes
[2:26:33] Insaif: Same reason I like Italian food. Lots of flavor. katesNom
[2:26:34] lorddracnor: don't need hot sauce if you remember pepper, sauce should stand as it's own ingredient

[2:28:17] Reighray: @Insaif that cow doesn't deserve to be that spicy
[2:28:25] traviebear: Huh just read the m9untain dew in my fridge 103mg/710ml
[2:28:30] FlameReetardantPanda: last night I ordered a spicy chicken pizza from a local place, which normally is just spicy because they add a spiral of sambal on it, but now they mix it into the white sauce base too.... it's too hot. I could barely enjoy the pizza
[2:28:33] IchibaToll: See, that's just bordering on being the food equivalent of driving around the biggest pickup truck imaginable.

[2:35:36] HurricaneChapman: I think normal salt is corrosive to the sidewalk
[2:35:41] abblepiewit: blue shit is ice melt. It doesn't do as much for grip for sure.

[2:36:02] if0rg0t2remember: litter works to provide traction but doesn't melt anything, it cheapo

[2:36:10] doc_sharon: Yesyes
[2:36:29] AshuraX13: Yep, lots of people keep litter in their cars in case they get stuck and need traction
[2:36:30] if0rg0t2remember: if you have a car, litter helps to keep in the trunk in case you get stuck, but not much else
[2:36:35] TheRealZed11: snow shoes are the key. if you get enough snow.

[4:34:12] doc_sharon: curing?  Like meats?
[4:34:16] kangg: usedWhoops
[4:34:21] vegasbrent: Aged?
[4:34:51] traviebear: Curing requires salts dry hanging is what he's talking g about.
[4:34:57] sharingiskaren: brine?
[4:35:27] brainbosh: Dry aging?
[4:35:36] traviebear: You hang it is a dry cool place.
[4:35:50] MyNameisTiff_: I looked it up and it's just called hanging.
[4:35:56] doc_sharon: he can be so frustrating katesPalm KEKW
[4:35:59] GenuineMind: Hooking? katesGiggle
[4:36:00] Aarek: I don't think just hanging things tenderizes meat
[4:36:14] Lerpukka: it's just hanging the meat
[4:36:18] VTMonster: I don't think we do that here
[4:36:19] Lerpukka: there is no special word for it
[4:36:19] CAYKE__: yeah hanging is all I can think of
[4:36:23] brainbosh: Then there probably isnt a common english word for it
[4:36:36] paullt2: ""dry aging" In English, the specific process referred to as "hängmörning" in Swedish doesn't have a direct, single-word equivalent. The closest term would be "dry aging," which is the process of aging meat, often by hanging it in a controlled environment. This method involves exposing the meat to air in a temperature-controlled space, which helps to tenderize it and enhance its flavor. However, "dry aging" doesn't explicitly convey the "hanging" aspect as the Swedish term does."
[4:36:37] vegasbrent: ... This guy
[4:36:59] Geo_Wolff: i work in a butchers and it is just called its definitely dry ageing

[4:38:13] l_meta: katesGiggle katesGiggle
[4:38:14] GenuineMind: i cont believe he's done this
[4:38:15] traviebear: Dry hanging is on the hook or rope dry aging is often on racks.

[4:38:23] sharingiskaren: every time he does this tell him how you’re sitting
[4:38:24] doc_sharon: peepoLeave
[4:38:30] hecktobreakfast: "hanging the meat ages it. that lets the enzymes in the meat makes the fivers softer and more elastic, which eventually leads to the meat becoming tender."
[4:38:31] Insaif: This man just can't say the thing he is trying to say. He has to give the full technical info about it first. katesGiggles
[4:38:33] AlliLovesGiraffes: Fancy meat
[4:38:35] ez_out: The Achilles method – The hanging hook is positioned through the rear heels. Gravity causes tension in these muscles as the carcass goes through rigor mortis which can result in tougher meat than tender-stretch method.

[5:09:38] A_Humble_Wooper: Or she could put them downstairs so they don't have a bare concrete floor, or save them for whomever buys another house later. One way or another they won't go to waste. Yesyes
[5:10:04] Sssaap: does it only highlight if you filter "xxl" or only show those?

[5:15:42] brainbosh: I mean that looks fine to me
[5:15:46] GriltCheesr: cove ceilings
[5:15:49] Insaif: Could fill that space with duct work to hid the overhang. katesHm
[5:15:54] mohler_47: but then the windows will be too high up the wall
[5:15:58] doc_sharon: could just have ductwork NODDERS
[5:15:58] arbucklezero: Oh, yeah, lower but with a step on the stairs when you come in
[5:16:13] brainbosh: My ceilings look like that lol
[5:16:15] Crafty_Crystal: yep
[5:16:15] UppyFF: the trip Reggie stair
[5:16:29] doc_sharon: same here NODDERS super common
[5:16:33] flathaed: can also just put a ceiling in the basement as well to hid the bulkheads
[5:16:38] Sssaap: or maybe not hiding the beams in the basement but have the windows at a proper height instead
[5:16:38] A_Humble_Wooper: Maybe that's why Summer needed so many floors? To do a double layer, floor and ceiling a few inches apart?

[5:17:01] KarnEvil: yeah, windows way to high now
[5:17:10] Insaif: The house walls aren't always straight to the grid the furniture aligns to.
[5:17:19] kay_bs0919: you could also hide the bulkheads with a rotated wall panel to look like a celling
[5:17:23] MarkFoxinator: or just a void
[5:17:23] Crafty_Crystal: it doesn’t have a ceiling that’s how it’s going to looks until you have one
[5:17:25] Thorn104: can we strink the floor at all?
[5:17:36] mohler_47: or two layers of "floor" one for walking on and one for the ceiling a few feet below
[5:17:37] zonerover: Yeah might need more floors to work around stuff
[5:17:38] fattydelrey: upstairs aesthetic over downstairs
[5:17:41] GriltCheesr: Can you base the floor height on the maximum height of the kitchen?
[5:17:42] brainbosh: You can always put in a ceiling on the bottom floor when you have the money for it
[5:17:43] PacMan419: need somewhere to hide the duct work anyways
[5:17:45] KarnEvil: @Thorn104 there are smaller floor options yeah.
[5:17:46] sibarone: it’s like a room for a basketball player upstairs
[5:17:47] melgary19: it’s just ducting downstairs
[5:17:57] Sssaap: do two XL instead of 1 XXL fit inside?
[5:18:09] doc_sharon: that's much much better NODDERS
[5:18:29] brainbosh: They look exactly the same to me
[5:18:34] Insaif: They literally have the same file name.
[5:19:03] arbucklezero: Does it look ok outside now?
[5:19:04] doc_sharon: unless you get smaller floor panels katesHm
[5:19:23] GenuineMind: OOOOOOO!
[5:19:30] GenuineMind: I leave for an hour and we got floors!
[5:19:44] Insaif: Probably need another, smaller piece to fill in if you pull the one in from the door side.
[5:19:59] kendo_b: guess this is why you need so many to fill n all the weird bits
[5:20:00] missloux: OMG floorrs! Noiicceee

[5:22:16] vegasbrent: I like that the new designer lets people preplan stuff saved in addition to committing stuff
[5:22:22] KarnEvil: yeah, thats massive.  is there any smaller options for prebuilt stuff?
[5:22:26] Crafty_Crystal: Are they all the same size?
[5:22:29] VTMonster: Too hugemongous
[5:22:33] traviebear: Not with the stairs on that side.
[5:22:38] Insaif: Unless you want the kitchen downstairs and move something else up here.
[5:22:43] AntiochChouteau: Would it be easier to make a more basic kitchen without the kit?
[5:22:48] MarkFoxinator: LUL
[5:23:06] Kthanid: I HATE that the walls are see through on one side for the kitchen.
[5:23:07] sharingiskaren: are all the kitchens in the kitchen the same size?
[5:23:17] sharingiskaren: *in the kits
[5:23:23] Insaif: @sharingiskaren All the ones from the premade kits are basically the same size, yes.

[5:23:50] Alteritus: that kitchen's as big as my house
[5:24:02] A_Humble_Wooper: It'd be BETTER pushed up against one wall... but still too big I think.
[5:24:04] Insaif: It's also a bit tricky because the back of it sticks out more than you might think.
[5:24:13] abblepiewit: there are other prebuilt kitchens, but each one is the size it is, yeah.
[5:24:25] sreylas: can you back it up over the stairs?
[5:24:26] Crazith: I think a custom kitchen might be better
[5:24:27] doc_sharon: katesHm
[5:24:40] Insaif: @sreylas A little bit, but not much more.
[5:24:41] Sssaap: i could have sworn the kitchens were different sizes
[5:24:42] GenuineMind: if not for the placement of that door, it would be a perfect two-story
[5:24:44] ScutiFruti: Can it be something else?

[5:25:26] zonerover: That would work
[5:25:29] vegasbrent: @traviebear Yeah, that one really was a good size
[5:25:29] doc_sharon: but just to see the spacing NODDERS
[5:25:45] fattydelrey: that wall it has is dumb
[5:26:05] doc_sharon: katesPlot
[5:26:30] Insaif: Yeah, you could wall it off on the side and add flooring below it to hide the back parts.
[5:26:34] doc_sharon: it's an option for sure NODDERS
[5:27:04] linq5: Could you have the stairs on the other side to stop the outside clipping of the floor?

[5:27:54] Kthanid: are the stairs are hard set on that side of the house?
[5:28:16] Insaif: Are the floors square or would rotating it 90 degrees make a difference?
[5:28:22] A_Humble_Wooper: Yeah.

[5:41:03] Sssaap: yea the xl one definitely seemed like the way to go and then just overlapping them where needed?
[5:41:18] AshuraX13: Maybe they only just added the xxl

[5:45:41] Sssaap: are the long pieces that you found also "big" flooring, or small?

[7:31:30] linq5: Could you use the large wall/floor left over to create a solid wall 'stair rail' for the time being?
[7:31:32] doc_sharon: not ass stashes katesShake
[7:31:35] Lerpukka: do the books fit inside that thing? kivaSip

[7:32:35] A_Humble_Wooper: I guess it could hold a small TV?
[7:32:37] fattydelrey: for nopixel statue maybe
[7:32:39] Insaif: Could go either way, but I wouldn't trust leaving a tv on that shelf.
[7:33:03] Insaif: I don't think you need to put stuff in your pockets to decorate. I think you can leave it in the furniture stash.
[7:34:06] AlleyCat_LaneUK: theres nicks trothy downstairs too
[7:34:12] Lerpukka: welcome to the Paleto library Yesyes
[7:34:35] CAYKE__: plant.
[7:34:36] Insaif: @AlleyCat_LaneUK I think that's the one she's using right now. She picked up all the furniture that was downstairs earlier.
[7:35:16] AlleyCat_LaneUK: @Insaif not what i saw
[7:35:20] doc_sharon: katesCheer

[7:36:37] Insaif: @AlleyCat_LaneUK Ah, you're right. I thought she grabbed that.
[7:38:10] doc_sharon: the good news is you can go out of bounds on the foundation and nobody will see it
[7:39:15] doc_sharon: peepoClap you got so much done today!
[7:39:17] Denetti_: probably will want a separate ceiling downstairs eventually to level it off
[7:39:22] MrSpiny: simpledLUL
[7:39:29] sreylas: prob was geoguesser
[7:40:00] A_Humble_Wooper: Yeah. That's silly.

[7:41:32] sreylas: feels livable
[7:41:34] Lerpukka: it feels and looks like someone is living there when one walks through the door
[7:41:35] doc_sharon: katesSnug
[7:41:35] jedi_raccoon: looks good
[7:41:36] firefrye: I'm just waiting to see how many secret stashes you can hide behind walls/pannels
[7:41:39] PacMan419: its better than your giving yourself credit it looks correct
[7:41:43] Insaif: We live here now. katesL
[7:41:54] Thorn104: not as a big of a box anymore :)
[7:42:10] Siirika: NODDERS Minor frustrations aside, there's a certain charm to seeing it build up slowly like this, instead of just ''boom 12h later, fully decorated house"
[7:42:11] VTMonster: Raid someone?
[7:42:19] KarnEvil: I wonder if anyone has hired Cyd yet.  I can't wait to see what she gets around to doing.

[7:43:05] doc_sharon: and you upgrade over time Yesyes
[7:43:12] Insaif: This definitely feels like some of the bare-bones Loaf It or List It houses we've seen.
[7:43:17] doc_sharon: peepoClap YAY!
[7:43:18] CAYKE__: its that first house after college you rent with buddies

[7:44:09] AshuraX13: I like how the upstairs came together
[7:44:33] abblepiewit: the downstairs floor still feels like the more difficult task, but you got the stairs and everything sorted which was probably THE thing that needed deciding. katesL
