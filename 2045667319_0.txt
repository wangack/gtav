[4:30:59] Seetherrr: how can you use self defense without brandishing at some point
[4:31:49] DeceitWithin: i mean, in any situation, it CAN be lethal, and the argument is can it be in self defense to pull a lethal weapon… I originally said its self defense when it was posed that a knife was pulled i. response, not a gun, which is a whole nother level of force multiplication
[4:33:24] bruhkewl: is pulling a weapon to get somebody to stop charging at you unreasonable?
[4:33:41] DeceitWithin: this situation is a big ol he said she said issue
[4:34:19] bruhkewl: did any witnesses corroborate that he was being charged?
[4:34:47] DeceitWithin: one party claims they were charged so they used a force multiplication, the other claims the opposing party used that force multiplication to hold the, at risk to stop their job
