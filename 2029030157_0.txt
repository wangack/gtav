[1:26:21] forgivme4partyrockingamen: YEP
[1:26:22] FrostyTide13: like its bad to say but its kinda gonna happen for them because how much staff do they really do for things
[1:26:23] nomiguda: saw a twitch staff in hasans chat say he was freaked out because he thought for a second another staff didn't have their wrench in chat
[1:26:35] Dogemaster11: @wakewilder apparently it’s happening because Amazon is trying to cut fat to merge fully with MGM
[1:26:40] cgee3too: there's a bunch of layoffs across several amazon owned services
[1:26:48] l0gg3rn: @kirk1022 isnt that the name that it was originally called?
[1:26:57] Dvicious012: The layoffs are mostly layoffs from the insanely massive hiring spree during the lockdown and twitch boom not to excuse the gross corporate actions
[1:27:03] fauxliving: Yeah they own MGM studios
[1:27:05] Imprisoned_Fetus: like with the lion?
[1:27:06] moishOkay: MGM studios
[1:27:10] TheCowThatSpamsC___Cam: they bought mgm
[1:27:14] papajohnshatner: It's "corporate accounting" and it sucks
[1:27:20] maiouxmaioux: i'm just glad the market will provide us with the happiest and most consumer friendly outcome
[1:27:24] eddimmu: a lot of companies, esp tech are downsizing,
[1:27:24] Acco10x: the rutabaga is a hybrid between the cabbage and the turnip peepoWow
[1:27:42] fauxliving: Yep Amazon bought MGM studios for 8.5 billion
[1:27:43] D__Clone: ...
[1:27:43] Dogemaster11: didn’t happen just in twitch it happened across all of Amazon/MFM
[1:27:43] moishOkay: way too many inexperienced people
[1:27:44] wirerope: @wakewilder a former twitch staff said that between the time she was interviewed and hired twitch grew 300% in 2016 and the amazon acquisition let them go wild
[1:27:45] Dogemaster11: MGM
[1:27:48] GavinMazey: YEP
[1:28:00] TheVulpecula: isnt google cutting like 30k
[1:28:04] D__Clone: I love being lied to for years
[1:28:09] MeatSoSmooth: dan clancy dropped the guillotine
[1:28:26] Dvicious012: Amazon also massively over paid for twitch at the time to scalp their live stream technology in order to develop and launch Prime Video
[1:28:28] KEKEmonster: they said twitch isnt profitable
[1:28:32] MeatSoSmooth: the entire tech sector is experience layoffs
[1:28:32] TheVulpecula: my bio degree aint doing much rn KEKW
[1:28:32] no0bus: Corpa 👍
[1:28:34] Dvicious012: Amazon never really cared about livestreaming
[1:28:35] nomiguda: I wonder if twitch will turn a profit for a while after the cuts
[1:28:38] GavinMazey: Profits above all else
[1:28:39] StreamElements: SUBSCRIBE ON YOUTUBE https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrJH-yCXrZJU5_fYArygfMw
[1:28:45] 13monad3: one of the kick owners said they want to buy twitch
[1:28:46] moishOkay: i swear a chatter says twitch isn't profitable every day
[1:28:50] Dogemaster11: it seems to be a top down decision from higher above Dan
[1:28:51] eddimmu: its part of chokepoint capitalism
[1:28:52] D__Clone: every tech company is cutting. when one company starts cutting they all do
[1:29:00] Oatmealyeti_: amazon also laid off a buncha ppl
[1:29:07] folypill: dan clancy acting on the envelopes Kappa
[1:29:21] kirk1022: @l0gg3rn idk what the gym was called prior to their purchase, but it had a lot of climbing related props and grassy interior as a Gym, so I doubt it was named "Iron Forge"
[1:29:25] MeatSoSmooth: the tech industry is experiencing a recession
[1:29:27] suburbanVegeta: making AWS look as profitable as possible is more important to Amazon than Twitch looking good
[1:29:29] wirerope: less employees more profit
[1:29:32] maiouxmaioux: opportunity for profit taking never passed up, raising prices or firing employees
[1:29:35] Dogemaster11: if tech companies cut what will happen is Silicon Valley going to turn into a gentrified version of Detroit
[1:29:39] no0bus: hasCapital hasCapital hasCapital
[1:29:41] moishOkay: get a job that isn't useless
[1:29:44] D__Clone: gotta buy back some stock
[1:29:55] folypill: theres a lot of tech outside of whats going on at silicon valley
[1:30:05] moishOkay: @folypill this too
[1:30:10] Dogemaster11: https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/amazon-cuts-hundreds-of-jobs-prime-video-mgm-studios-layoffs-1235784340/amp/
[1:30:11] kirk1022: yeah, its what WWE ha done for the last 2-3 years before merging with UFC.
[1:30:11] eddimmu: but twitch is in danger, with kick and now X as competition...
[1:30:15] walio19: they are cutting the useless slum who sit on their desk all they without any work to do like all tech companies are doing after over hiring
[1:30:24] Dvicious012: Twitch was a massive advertising funnel for Amazon prime and eventually Prime Video they always only saw this site as a big billboard for their other products they don't give a shit about streamers
[1:30:36] MeatSoSmooth: that doesn't mean they're not a competitor
[1:30:38] no0bus: Corpa Clap
[1:30:50] papajohnshatner: Kick is a Twitch clone funded by crypto LUL
[1:31:10] JoyySpring: mhm
[1:31:17] Rychron: @papajohnshatner And Gamba
[1:31:18] nomiguda: stake and kick will be the alternate names of a F1 team this year
[1:31:18] maiouxmaioux: i'm probably gobbling up half the bandwidth watching multiple GTA RP streams or hopping around lol
[1:31:21] D__Clone: youtube is the only company that could give twitch a run and they said fuck that shit
[1:31:22] no0bus: Stake Kick has bought out a Formula 1 teams name
[1:31:22] papajohnshatner: Microsoft learned with Mixer
[1:31:23] MeatSoSmooth: I don't understand how having your streaming site propped up via gambling makes it less of a competitor than being propped up by amazon
[1:31:26] Dvicious012: Youtube gave up on live streaming expansion and FB dumped their livestreaming should tell you everything you need to know
[1:31:33] Oatmealyeti_: i wonder if x is also gonna use amazons ivs lol
[1:31:44] no0bus: And F1 is notorious for shady sponsorships
[1:31:44] TheVulpecula: @D__Clone not a big enough pie for them to care about it seems KEKW tiktok a much bigger beast
[1:31:50] eddimmu: youtube decided to compete with tiktok instead, maybe they didnt care aobut streaming as mabye more money in short form content
[1:31:56] nomiguda: depends on the legality of advertising stake in the country the race is held in
[1:31:56] yoitsmike321: @nomiguda yeah because all those crypto sponsors was great for F1 lol they never learn
[1:31:58] thestream_stalker: people always think twitch will fall down with stremers but people forget theres always the next genration of people who wanna be stremers who will replices the top streamers an most other streamers platforms don't have that drive
[1:32:06] fauxliving: @no0bus I miss the Marlboro sponsorships for F1
[1:32:06] morsechicken: did you see the debacle
[1:32:09] StreamElements: RESPONDED TO DAILY LIVE ON STREAM https://forms.gle/Fu9Yav7MLfik3msUA
[1:32:15] danknesss4207: @wakewilder CYR's server sounds like Beef!
[1:32:16] moishOkay: YouTube could've done it but they went at it with the worst approach. you do not go to YouTube to watch a stream
[1:32:19] Amanduhhduh: TRUE
[1:32:29] TheRodriguezTwins: kick feels like they only promote the ice crew... so sad
[1:32:32] Rychron: Streaming will never die
[1:32:35] eddimmu: youtube investing heavy in shorts, and meta with reels
[1:32:36] Dogemaster11: Tik Tok is really what we have to learn about, it will kill cable, and probably other websites
[1:32:43] fauxliving: That Schumacher era of Ferrari with the Marlboro sponsor was amazing
[1:33:25] TheRodriguezTwins: yeah i agree def
[1:33:39] TheVulpecula: @iphaptoocars2 they hate not profiting off the gambling KEKW
[1:33:43] Dogemaster11: kick is a joke literally a splinter cell spawned by crypto bros and a streamer with a vendetta
[1:33:51] A_Trask: huh cross pollinate
[1:33:52] SoundOfGiants: adin ross has gambled 2 billion it’s monopoly money it’s insane
[1:33:55] nomiguda: @fauxliving, phillip morris, the company that owns the marlboro brand, only recently cut ties with ferrari like 3 years ago
[1:34:06] r3za_3: i feel like there is less viewers on twitch than back maybe 3 or 2 years ago i could be wrong
[1:34:14] TheVulpecula: they'll probably allow sports gambling KEKW
[1:34:25] r3za_3: True
[1:34:49] moishOkay: it trickled down. more big streamers now
[1:34:51] FrostyTide13: the ones that leave already have those big followings and have been doing things on other sites prior, they dont just leave and retain the same numbers. and usually when they leave its for a good contract
[1:34:52] pjsalt420_1: i also think gen alpha isnt really into livestreams
[1:34:55] Bad_Simulation: simulation
[1:34:56] KAERNK: Youtube would have to get 20+ of the top streamers all at once for them to compete with Twitch
[1:34:59] eddimmu: ludwig is crushing it on youtube,
[1:35:01] fauxliving: @nomiguda And it's been downhill ever since KEKW
[1:35:09] StreamElements: TRUTH OR DAB THIS THURSDAY -- ASK AWAY https://forms.gle/chyYmFxVEASiFVjn9
[1:35:13] papajohnshatner: He's one of the few
[1:35:22] TANKness137: Most tech companies scaled way too hard during covid so I would be surprised if amazon didn't as well
[1:35:33] Elky3: Ludwig made himeself off his subathon
[1:35:39] wirerope: Ludwig was at 40k when he went to YT he is not there anymore
[1:35:44] Dvicious012: Youtube is still not a live streaming site people only watch live sterams of youtubers they are subscribed to
[1:35:47] eddimmu: ludwig doing well on yt, but myth not so much,
[1:35:55] Koldia: @wakewilder i dont even no where to find streams on youtube
[1:36:03] FrostyTide13: and even if they grab those top streamers, how much money are they willing to shell out for it and what kind of payout will they perceive they get
[1:36:20] moishOkay: @Koldia that's the thing, you don't lmao
[1:36:20] D__Clone: youtube isn't optimized for streaming even though being able to backup the stream is really nice
[1:36:34] papajohnshatner: @Koldia The directory is one of the biggest problems for sure
[1:37:04] Dogemaster11: streaming isn’t priority for YouTube though
[1:37:17] moishOkay: yeah YouTube will be fine. Kick will not be fine
[1:37:52] maiouxmaioux: Yes!
[1:37:57] eddimmu: because ludwig said youtube preferred shorts over streaming, they not putting as much into it , but hes still with them for 1 more year, he got another big bag prolly
[1:38:01] Dogemaster11: YouTube interests me, a good amount of YouTubers have started to retire the old guard is leaving and I don’t know who will replace them, I think many of the big internet names are either streamers or Tik tokers
[1:38:02] Bad_Simulation: have twitch tried picture in picture ads?
[1:38:04] moishOkay: bro what happened to the banner ads. those were perfect
[1:38:06] Oatmealyeti_: i dont mind the side ads on mobile but i never watch on mobile lol
[1:38:06] D__Clone: they have started adding side adds
[1:38:10] D__Clone: ads
[1:38:11] r3za_3: A lot of people leave streams after they get ads right?
[1:38:22] Dvicious012: Twitter is bleeding advertisers and Kick never had advertisers so they'll never make money
[1:38:34] eddimmu: amouranth made 57 mill on OF, holy shittttt
[1:38:42] papajohnshatner: He can co stream his events on twitch though
[1:39:09] walio19: parasocial andies ICANT
[1:39:13] Dogemaster11: are there really any big YouTubers nowadays?
[1:39:15] eddimmu: @papajohnshatner yea under diff name
[1:39:17] r3za_3: @eddimmu thats insane
[1:39:20] Amanduhhduh: TRUE TRUE
[1:39:26] wirerope: TOOBASED
[1:39:28] Dogemaster11: besides Mr beast of course who else is there
[1:39:33] FrostyTide13: as much as people want to hate on twtich and meme it, its not that bad
[1:39:43] eddimmu: @r3za_3 shes very smart, make that bag whie you can
[1:39:45] papajohnshatner: @papajohnshatner mogul moves or whatever it is still incredibly connected to him
[1:39:48] jopeyes: do you think 50/50 sub split is fair?
[1:39:48] nomiguda: and twitch also has stuff like the emote extensions, chatterino
[1:39:59] moishOkay: 7TV works on YouTube
[1:40:32] Dogemaster11: I should probably get turbo then
[1:40:42] maiouxmaioux: But will it move to 20 80 Amazon's table heh
[1:40:46] TheRodriguezTwins: for people starting out i feel like its so hard to grow on twitch but harder on yt and kick without collabs. i hope twitch can improve on discoverability. feels more like a monopoly sometimes
[1:40:47] Dvicious012: only like .001% streamers had 70/30 in the first place people act like every streamer on the platform got screwed
[1:40:50] hrafnagut: turbo is pog
[1:40:50] majestic_rains_: i love turbo
[1:40:51] jopeyes: especially considering prime subs. is prime subs also the same split?
[1:40:53] FrostyTide13: subing is for you having a badge and being able to use their emotes, if people wanna fully support a streamer than they can donate
[1:40:54] no0bus: Oh shit
[1:41:02] unobtainiumxx: EZ turbo
[1:41:06] moishOkay: YouTube is probably the easiest
[1:41:13] l0gg3rn: does streamelements take any fees?
[1:41:16] D__Clone: youtube isn't that hard to grow on if you play the algo
[1:41:27] no0bus: How do streamers get a cut from twitch turbo?
[1:41:27] Dogemaster11: twitch isn’t a monopoly but it’s part of one
[1:41:28] big_rhino7: Yeah, I don't think most people can even be bothered flicking through 2-3 platforms to find livestreamers they like watching when 90% of the people they watch are on Twitch. Fuck that just stay on Twitch
[1:41:38] D__Clone: tictoc is the easiest to grow on of all the platforms
[1:41:40] nomiguda: it's so easy to open like 15 tabs on kick and suddenly the viewcount is like 40
[1:41:41] TheRodriguezTwins: thats true
[1:41:43] papajohnshatner: too many fish
[1:41:55] Dogemaster11: do you think Emily would do well on YouTube ?

[2:44:07] hrafnagut: @wakewilder The Kermode bear, sometimes called the spirit bear (Ursus americanus kermodei), is a subspecies of the American black bear and lives in the Central and North Coast regions of British Columbia, Canada. While most Kermode bears are black, between 100 and 500 fully white individuals exist. The white variant is known as spirit bear, and is most common on three islands in British Columbia (Gribbell, Princess Royal, and Roderick), where they make up 10–20% of the Kermode population.

[2:59:59] buggzymalones: the intro literally said he has a number of michellan stars...
[3:00:02] lush_puppies: ppl wanna down play it bc the idea of "celebrity chef" somehow knocks chefs down a peg. but gordon is legit and most chefs will attest to that

[3:01:13] SirYogiWan: Gordon has worked some of the hardest kitchens in the world, even before he was famous
[3:01:15] fauxliving: That's like saying bourdain was a shitty chef because he did tv

[3:01:20] T_mac87: thats why they smoke
[3:01:29] butlerian_jihadist: YEP they are toxic environments, there's a lot of pressure and a lot of stress
[3:01:30] lush_puppies: anyone who's worked more than one job in the service industry will agree, kitchens are insane
[3:01:31] SirYogiWan: yep, kitchens can be heaps toxic
[3:01:32] FrostyTide13: people always add weird and different things to their sandwitches, its all personal taste
[3:01:35] ItsAmes1312: There's a rare few select ones that arent, but every other one is toxic for sure,to various degree

[3:06:09] GavinMazey: 5 guys fries top tier
[3:06:10] hazymydude: @wakewilder In n out has 2oz patties, 5 guys has ~3.3-4oz patties. So its at best the same amount of food but more expensive at 5 Guys. Their burgers are def better but amount of food wise youre wrong here

[3:13:50] oozoq: we👏need👏joe👏is👏hungry👏
[3:13:52] butlerian_jihadist: patties, and meat in general, are always measured pre-cooked
[3:13:54] kschumann: 65 grams is like 2.3 ounces
[3:14:03] hazymydude: did you all know that every tortilla chip actually comes from the same factory?
[3:14:17] lush_puppies: "A Five Guys patty, according to its nutritional numbers, clocks in at around 3.3 ounces, more than 50 percent bigger than the one from In-N-Out. (That explains some of the price difference, no doubt.) Each Five Guys patty has 17 grams of fat, making for a fat-to-lean meat ratio of 18 percent." - The Washington Post @wakewilder
