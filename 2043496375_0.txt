[0:17:00] Tyler4AM: kivaLove kivaCult
[0:17:00] Sapphire_Tears: I think it’s a plus
[0:17:17] yungVDD: I think that Siz and Ant are mature enough as leaders to respond how they did
[0:17:19] SavageAnimals: @imdeatht1 I think everyone forgot that the deal was supposed to help the PD catch up so they could also help the guild with pc stuff KEKW
[0:17:31] Scanda4: yooo flame jacket peepoPog
[0:17:54] crossjesterx: that’s just a bad argument cause no one is perfect, you just have to be willing to owning up to mistakes
[0:18:08] Necro_Ex_Mortis: You guys also didn't ask for the rack, it was offered to you by Trey
[0:18:11] Sunwolfcreature: kivaCozy
[0:18:23] ryanstiIes: Mary really hasn’t interacted with Siz a lot, so I could see her not being used to his style
[0:18:29] o0ZOE0o: that's kind of a leadership mentality too - like you've learned that that attitude in the situation doesnt mesh well for outcomes
[0:18:43] ryanstiIes: true
[0:18:56] Grimm420: yea all the mats were gonna get handled then pay back the btc after they were able to
[0:18:58] Sapphire_Tears: yup

[0:19:24] StarEater_: was it established what kaneshiro is?

[0:19:39] Ehnita: It's Mary's gang
[0:19:51] ryy89: a whole week even!
[0:19:52] SavageAnimals: Then denzel kicked her KEKW
[0:19:53] Grimm420: I think when she joined hoa is when everyone was in for terrorism, so she didnt get any time with him really
[0:19:58] ANDRO_core: Denzel came back and cleaned house
[0:20:01] squoogelol: cant wait for andi and siz' matching fits PepeLaugh
[0:20:04] imdeatht1: Yeah because he didnt know her at all
[0:20:09] Ehnita: She referenced being HoA in 3.0
[0:20:09] mistahouse2197: @imdeatht1 yeah but that was years ago. Siz of 2.0 isn’t the same as 4.0
[0:20:12] yungVDD: I thought she wanted to be in HOA and then never hung out with anybody but apparently she felt still slighted by that in 3.0 so its all in the past
[0:20:17] Foxe_fox: 2.0
[0:20:21] Tyler4AM: Can you believe that Siz stole Andi's paleto-core outfit yesterday
