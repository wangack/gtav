[2:54:40] Hento: Drive fast and mald if they get you
[2:54:41] Calphalor: angels basicaly stopped doing heist in 3,0 its the main reason bogo left them
[2:54:44] PanadaTM: Angels are civs now KEKLEO
[2:54:51] ianshiva: I remember every plan used to be called a rat strat but in the end isn’t everything a rat strat?
[2:54:52] ykicka: it's done to prevent burn out from Cops having to respond to the same thing call after call but different groups, it's just been poorly thought out on the dev side of things
[2:55:01] heiseneberg4101: Few days ago tried the vault and got breached by NBC PepeLaugh @UberHaxorNova
[2:55:06] TheRarePotato: @nam_stex yeah but then he'd have to be close with CB too and even then there are random groups like NBC hitting stuff
[2:55:10] NoodleDays: Grandma a civ now uhnSuffer
[2:55:11] LuckyMisfit: When's the last time the lost did a job. in 2.0 we had fun setting up dumb shit, now it's just too much of a hassle to get everything sorted.

[2:55:35] Hento: I miss jewlery store....
[2:55:38] mangocubes_: core gameplay loop that you influence NODDERS
[2:55:45] Razinmaru74: 2.0 was so fun to watch so happy i got into rp to watch that
[2:55:53] Hento: smash grab, all you needed was a class 2 and it was always a response
[2:55:56] Algork_: The thing is, you go for RP first
[2:56:01] 3spada_Grande: Bank is just the stage
[2:56:07] BillNyeTheRoboRussianSpy: the cops get burnt out if there's too much crime danOld
[2:56:09] hachi6zero: the problem is two fold, the chance to do heist is less these days with every group spam it at cooldown and cops response is too hard to do foolproof plan that not resort to rat/shooting tactics
[2:56:10] ohmygawww: it seems like the way the server is going, it starts to adapt and cater more to the bigger and more established groups uhnSuffer
[2:56:16] rashytushy: something needs to change
[2:56:19] Keeb_city: Some people are just in it for the imaginary money
[2:56:25] Rodolas: all these wonderful tools the devs have built in 3.0, and 2.0 ends up being more creative with jobs Sadge
[2:56:26] Purplevivid: also more people in the server but less shit to rob
[2:56:28] ErrorNV: do you feel like RP is valued differently now than to a year ago?
[2:56:28] FlametrowerOP: Some people just do some bike plans and be done with it
[2:56:30] RoronoaZoro: Even cg has issues hitting banks
[2:56:30] GGCStorm: i feel like if people wanna have more "fun" it depends on how they go about it like a job can go so many ways all depending on how you plan it the people in it you can make so many different ways of doing the same job but make it so the outcome or the way to go about it is so much different making it way way more fun
[2:56:34] eastcoastace: @keeb_city FACT
[2:56:38] Hento: nothing will change til cb and cg do it all
[2:56:42] DavesDead: It’s a content server now. Sheesh.

[2:57:06] eastcoastace: Tbh
[2:57:06] Brennanan: driving fast and shooting cops is poggers
[2:57:11] Calphalor: yeah either youre doing oxy runs or selling meth/weed or youre a top heist group there seems to be barely any mid tier stuff
[2:57:14] LuckyMisfit: petty crime went the way of the dinosaur sadKEK
[2:57:14] BlurryFace79: I would rather have spamy banks, then have no groups be able to hit banks at all
[2:57:28] icloudburst: The content is malding about cops all day uhnKek
[2:57:29] TheRarePotato: I still remember the dumbest comment of the reddit about it "HOA isn't a heist crew"
[2:57:31] ianshiva: Cover your cough uhnRee
[2:57:42] Hento: recon
[2:57:43] 3spada_Grande: There were definitely people complaining in 2.0 about having to come up with plans for jobs but then cops just end up shutting it down
[2:57:49] icloudburst: No rp
[2:57:52] shadowraptor7: wait i thought book guy was staying with the blocks?
[2:58:04] Rodolas: cops wonder why there are so many drug trafficking cases, it is because that is the only real crime accessible by lower tier crims
[2:58:05] Lamemo: it's down to the cops if they want to have fun jobs or just squash it and go to the other new thing
[2:58:07] PunishedJester: Increase payouts and limit one group per day via hackermans cooldown.
[2:58:07] PanadaTM: We used to complain about the HOA never getting a cop response. Now they don’t even get to do jobs Sadge
[2:58:08] Nightbot: We? modCheck I didn't see you in there. Tell us what uhnYou are doing in NoPixel uhnNotes
[2:58:15] ErrorNV: where Writers Block at yo pentawBlock
[2:58:19] chocodreamzzz: it was a problem spamming in 2.0 about over working cops but now theres like 30 cops on
[2:58:21] hachi6zero: i think one of the problem is that most of group limiting their RP on heist only. Not much group do business RP anymore.
[2:58:28] GGCStorm: i don't know if this has been done or even able to do but has anyone ever use the cargo bob after a bank heist to have people go down the highway to have the cargo bob come down and hook the car to take off with it?

[2:59:24] coldskye: jewelry store most likely could end up with cops breaking off for 'higher priority' though.
[2:59:25] Hc_CowBell: @ggcstorm I think I haave seen that in 2.0 if I remember correctly
[2:59:32] DavesDead: What’s koil been up to? That’s probably the new meta.

[3:00:20] BlurryFace79: @roronoazoro Yea but at least for top groups they have a chance at the banks, anyone below doesn’t even come close

[3:01:06] Calphalor: the problem right now is there so many people in the city atm that you need more jobs to do but more jobs means you also need more police and the police needs to actualy be coordinated about their responses to different heists
