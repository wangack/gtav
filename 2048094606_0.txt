[3:26:52] DJayMooch: is there any way to garnish wages aka with payslips?
[3:26:52] xwarnpeacex: doc rp brilliant
[3:26:54] Sweets_64: I feel like that might just push out the little bit of crims the server has left
[3:26:57] k9b0ca: how is your head looking at who is talking
[3:26:57] bulletmonkey85: give them jobs in prison where they can work off the fine
[3:26:57] liitty_savage: They should sell their ass in prison
[3:27:00] xZailious: debt lifers KEKW
[3:27:04] robin1904: Maybe community work should give more money so they have a chance to pay off fines?
[3:27:07] 4_Head_: @Kyle make them work in the mines
[3:27:09] MrTraceer: Bail bonds business
[3:27:16] Kemli: Madge Its not that hard, let in special jobs around the City that pay more for them
[3:27:18] Bnooru: Or a Cabaret ))
[3:27:18] Timmo001: Tag em!
[3:27:22] breakingchainz: Having trackers would be cool
[3:27:22] Rem753: what're you in for? "unpaid traffic tickets"
[3:27:23] ToastedRubber: Simple prison job fixes that.
[3:27:29] Anterra: i like the tracker idea
[3:27:32] TheTapsu: PausersHype parole program
[3:27:32] eseShami: I want to see The Matador VS John F Television Jr
[3:27:33] maijellies: LOOL
[3:27:39] SamzieNA: ANKLE MONITORS
[3:27:45] Bankseyyyyy: Still like my favourite bit in Onx KEKW
[3:27:45] DoctorDuke: House arrest ankle bracelets LUL LUL
[3:27:50] Jesus_Saves_Us: if the warden owned the cluckin bell for instance he could do work release for prisoners to work at the cluckin bell to server food dressed as inmates with guards watching and public heckling them
[3:28:12] D4rkkkk_: lookUp
[3:28:17] Archaius: getting tracked until ur fines are payed off is a good way to get em to pay
[3:28:22] Jesus_Saves_Us: could be funny rp
[3:28:37] SamzieNA: YES
[3:28:38] BartelleJ: them "clocking in" to community service where they earn $350 an hour while in jail until the fine's completely paid might be a good balance
[3:28:38] notparanoidbut: mmHmm
[3:28:40] TheVillageKid: Have it based on the severity of the crime. The higher severity, no chance of community service.
[3:28:47] SamzieNA: ANKLE MONITOR W BLUETOOTH TAZER
[3:28:47] Pexterra: it would be so cool if there was an aging system then spending time in jail actually matters
[3:28:49] The_Warrior1: NOOOO Don't chain JFTV
[3:28:49] Tylermcd93: How come?
[3:28:53] h3b3s: hmmMeeting
[3:28:57] sir_redbeard: Wage Garnishing is the only way to actually get paid
[3:28:57] Slesh5: Idk I think it's a fun alternative to jail
[3:28:58] Natrix91: its 2024. everyting is tracking
[3:28:59] lids_etc: traumzYAP
[3:29:00] 50_tiger: How about an ankle taser
[3:29:02] one_two_x_you730: You have to be able to find them though or they can just run
[3:29:03] A_DeviousHawk: nah it makes sense
[3:29:10] Obi_Wan_Jabroni: i like the idea of tracking on paper, but not in practice honestly.
[3:29:11] DrNycoleGreen: I mean if this RP is to mimick IRL then this will work lmaooo
[3:29:13] NJFSlowBurn: pentawHmm
[3:29:14] Timmo001: Like a 100% student loan
[3:29:14] MrSym: Tracking could work if it's not an exact location and you have to do work to actually locate them
[3:29:14] Livelethal: @50_tiger shock collar lol
[3:29:17] SamzieNA: should be mandated to do sanitation cause NO ONE wants to do that
[3:29:18] DJayMooch: wage garnishing sounds interesting, in the gta world not real life lol. pay slips give less and instead pay down the debts
[3:29:23] xZailious: delayed tracking? bank activity?
[3:29:24] sterowentUS: a big part of GTARP fun is either chasing crims or being crims. tracking would kind of fuck that up
[3:29:27] one_two_x_you730: It's to secure the accountability
[3:29:28] PekkenTV: GoldPLZ
[3:29:33] EpicHuggles: its already hard enough to be a crim on this server
[3:29:37] Jesus_Saves_Us: businesses who sign up for employing inmate working for work release sounds like an amazing idea for creating rp
[3:29:45] DJayMooch: or they make illegal money and can go pay it off somewhere
[3:29:47] sincerist: what if they work out like a repayment plan where they have to pay $100 a week or so and if they don't release the bounty hunters
[3:29:48] LL_Cool_Tre: what if that‚Äôs not an option past like 5k
[3:29:50] MrSym: @EpicHuggles Crime has consequences Shrug
[3:29:51] h3b3s: peepoWhisper
[3:29:54] SamzieNA: death sentence
[3:30:02] yoyomancoolman: @sterowentUS yeah but thats the point of why u dont want to be in debt like that
[3:30:05] BartelleJ: almost has to be sentenced until fine is paid off
[3:30:06] Bulfwyne: I say it'd be good if the bounty hunters catch the guy, they should only pay 60% of the total ? and gotta work a little bit supervised ?
[3:30:07] one_two_x_you730: Then they rot!
[3:30:08] trenchkidjayz: if all this stuff happens people WILL pay their fines to avoid this
[3:30:10] xZailious: pentawEeBey
[3:30:11] chaospiper322: pentawMikeWeird
[3:30:13] Axiom462: it's called the death penalty
[3:30:15] mkam225: The underlying problem is probably that crime is just not paying enough to make it a viable option
[3:30:16] Bolinko: this system needs a ankle tracker that goes off if they aren‚Äôt making money at a legitimate business. the. they get scooped up by bounties again and go to jail
[3:30:22] Vizimas: Vizimas subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! Lovegers

[3:30:26] Bankseyyyyy: Is asset seizure not at thing?
[3:30:32] Kemli: pentawBlock I mean as long as I got the money
[3:30:35] ToastedRubber: Good idea.
[3:30:37] SamzieNA: can't seize what they dont have
[3:30:45] Kemli: no one really has assets yet
[3:30:46] Doogli: release the mines
[3:30:48] Meatyfrog: Negative Banks, cause massive inflation
[3:30:55] Jesus_Saves_Us: if the work release inmates mess around then the business who is employing them can call a parol or bounty hunter to come collect the misbehaving inmate workers
[3:30:56] Bulfwyne: yea you just get chracters like Mel LUL
[3:30:56] one_two_x_you730: Not going into the negative is actually smart and good for RP
[3:30:59] boomerangwayne: 2.0 Mel and Kiki KEKW
[3:31:00] NotShawnSD: @Bankseyyyyy people barely have assets
[3:31:02] Timmo001: Ooh that could work
[3:31:05] DemonLord81: OmegaLuL Military Conscription for people that have crazy fines
[3:31:09] mr_deepsense_: This way adds more rp
[3:31:10] Jesus_Saves_Us: to put em back behind bars
[3:31:12] Axiom462: now we're looking at social credit scores
[3:31:14] sterowentUS: @yoyomancoolman but there are other ways to punish them while also keeping it fun for policing. involving their close friends, their gangs, things like that
[3:31:15] forgotten_soldierz: Better pay for jobs
[3:31:16] trenchkidjayz: ooo
[3:31:20] one_two_x_you730: oooo

[3:31:26] Aary: need to buff the economy
[3:31:32] 50_tiger: That could be implemented easy too with a simple tag
[3:31:35] Bulfwyne: mike block already found that out too LUL "I just wont pay shit"
[3:31:36] LeviaDraconia: damn
[3:31:36] Demosthenex: Low Social Credit Score
[3:31:37] Bankseyyyyy: Good points that people don't currently have assets but somewhere down the line I think it'd be a good step
[3:31:37] Timmo001: No access to the state benefits
[3:31:39] giotan87: What if the state take 10 procent from their hourly wage
[3:31:47] piercejackson: almost sounds like they should just implement a lien system.
[3:31:56] h3b3s: wait who is hat carl i was expecting pred. i haven't been here for a long time soz
[3:31:56] one_two_x_you730: Now that the mayor is in the economy will obviously grow

[3:33:54] h3b3s: mmHmm
[3:34:00] one_two_x_you730: Should also ask about the cops stealing your bounties too, that shit seems kind of wack. Like if something happens to them they could claim their were injured under your custody
[3:34:19] chrishandled: forever jail!
[3:34:21] Bolinko: @Kyle What do you think about the ankle tracker idea.  The tracker goes off and alerts bounty hunters if they arent logged in making money at legit businesses
[3:34:22] Kemli: pentawBlock Hell naw dawg
[3:34:24] ToastedRubber: Prison Job to pay off the fines

[3:34:48] MrTraceer: the bond system should be private

[3:34:58] bulletmonkey85: there not giving anyone money,  someone is paying to get them out of jail

[3:36:14] mr_deepsense_: Make them work for it in jail until they are able to pay for it, Jail jobs.
[3:36:15] GxdzR6: they have to have assets to bail someone out
[3:36:15] xZailious: asset minimums as collateral to qualify for bail
[3:36:18] Astrodie: jaboodyLOL
[3:36:26] Kemli: Time to bump the wages now that the Mayor is in
[3:36:28] forgotten_soldierz: Better paying jobs will help people pay

[3:37:14] Obi_Wan_Jabroni: this is a very interesting conversation honestly.
[3:37:21] SamzieNA: reaganomics on pushing that poverty line lower and lower
[3:37:21] holyshirtpro: make them both go into jail so the other person cant pay  for the friends bond if they were posted bond
[3:37:22] TonkaTush: Server needs a Biden to cancel Criminal Loans PEPW
[3:37:25] BartelleJ: Matt big Guy Fieri guy
[3:37:28] Slesh5: I think the solution will be forcing them to work and collect their pay
[3:37:29] Ryponino: pentawPP
[3:37:34] Schhwifty: And if chars are hard jailed for a long time they'll just character hop Shrug
[3:37:37] ToastedRubber: I don't understand DOC is getting up and running why not just a well paying prison jobs ?
[3:37:44] Kemli: OH time to add a quarry with inflated rates of pay, and work on a pro rata basis
[3:37:45] yoyomancoolman: do the mines Shrug
[3:37:47] CanadianDeeNo: Is there a way that in order to buy certian things, you need credit. Longer your fines are ignored the worse your credit. Bad credit means no car/house/maybe even phone?
[3:37:49] 50_tiger: If it fills the prison thats great for the DOC
[3:37:50] one_two_x_you730: Make the bail cash up front?
[3:37:51] Bulfwyne: need Cobalt to be a thing NODDERS need bail bonds/lonas
[3:37:53] Bulfwyne: loans*

[3:37:58] Venenare: yea fuck it garnish a percent of their wages and if they are found with more than that seize the $
[3:38:02] TonkaTush: Tags are the best way to get people to play this stuff out in RP

[3:38:21] Bolinko: If you reach $100k in debt, you get executed, and people can pay to see the execution, which pays off the debt LUL
[3:38:22] Bulfwyne: If crims are making money at jobs, they should be taxed a percenteage
[3:38:23] SamzieNA: should just open a new state job roll for criminals to work on like sanitation or a car wash or something and do something that helps gen pop to pay off fines
[3:38:31] Tylermcd93: Just execute them EZ
[3:38:34] h3b3s: mmHmm  Û†ÄÄ
[3:38:36] Timmo001: A credit system would be cool

[3:38:39] Axiom462: throttle their queue Kappa
[3:38:39] Conorwayne: @bolinko medieval style
[3:38:43] Natrix91: @Kyle or make them work up a serthen amount of money in jail to pay a % of the fine then they can go outh and make money to pay the rest :P
[3:38:45] Bolinko: hell ya
[3:38:48] Ellzybub: rentals cost twice as much and the extra money goes to paying off their fines

[3:41:24] spread___eagle: Then they get sent to the mines or chain gang
[3:41:26] CrystalCoder: one way or another, you'd have to do prison jobs, to pay off something.
[3:41:35] tac0z805: what if they get blacklisted from using phones and cant call, do crime jobs or use crypto until they pay

[3:41:55] AlwaysRecon: time to bring back the mines
[3:42:03] DrNycoleGreen: exactly the 10% goes to the state
[3:42:04] PhantomRogue: i mean, you have to have a 'bonus' to actually paying, else they will always just go jail/work
[3:42:07] one_two_x_you730: You can have some Al Capone running the crims from the inside
[3:42:12] IrrationallyUbiquitous: Cobalt Mines
[3:42:14] spread___eagle: I wonder if it's possible to just garnish wages or if the code doesn't allow for that
[3:42:16] tangobish: its to complicated

[3:42:29] Axiom462: @PhantomRogue or make the jail/work more of a negative
[3:42:32] one_two_x_you730: @tangobish ????

[3:42:54] Obi_Wan_Jabroni: @tangobish for right now, but as it builds it could get fleshed out
[3:42:56] one_two_x_you730: @tangobish That is redundant dooming
[3:43:04] PhantomRogue: @Axiom462 doesnt matter, still wont deter them, why would I pay 30k vs doing 5 irl days in jail
[3:43:06] Conorwayne: yeah not that complicated
[3:43:07] percidus_: NODDERS

[3:43:35] Slesh5: what happens if they end up in jail -do they work it off there?
[3:43:37] tangobish: @one_two_x_you730 no its the opposite actually simplifying things can promote rp
[3:43:38] Conorwayne: doing all of this jsut add extra layers of RP akin the real life
[3:43:39] cabers01: grind THIS Sussy
[3:43:40] Rigben: @PhantomRogue people don't get 30k fines from 1 arrest though
[3:43:40] killmotion32: "work camp" in a prison, make them stand at machinery all day and make something profitable, sell said merchandise. boom win-win
[3:43:44] DrNycoleGreen: This will make people esp crims understand there are consequences for doing crime, or any person rather
[3:43:45] xZailious: pentawBeef my rp is cleaning dishes in prison

[3:44:17] BartelleJ: Judge, Jury, Bounty Hunter
[3:44:17] Bulfwyne: NODDERS This is good
[3:44:19] Batsie07: bounty hunter should get 10%/20% of the fines even if the person can't pay. its not fair to the bounty hunter

[3:46:25] Spikee439: 8th amendment violation?
[3:46:25] bazzela: yeah 30 days in jail can kill characters

[5:56:27] OptimusJon: Need to see Batman Dawnbreaker, where he takes full control of the ring and kills people @Kyle

[5:57:00] d3vastator: @InquisitorDex yeh
[5:57:01] Kemli: there've been instances in comics and shows where a mind controlled Lantern still had control of their ring Shrug

[5:58:13] MaximumEagle: Yo hold the stream, I gotta take a leak PEEPEE
[5:58:17] AKoboldonStilts: From what I can tell in this game, Braniac's indoctrination has more or less convinced the League that what they're doing is the right thing, so GL's will hasn't been overtaken.
[5:58:20] Astrodie: LUL
[5:58:21] audiyomind: Who??

[5:58:34] Spirit_FM: why is penguin in metropolis?
[5:58:34] manbrasucks: @Kemli google is saying the will power is still there, it's just being directed by the mind controller. Like putting a leash on a pit bull still means it can bite children
[5:58:35] TyJoRa: @Kyle Lois Lane out here leaking Batman's identity like how Pred leaked Benchguy KEKW
