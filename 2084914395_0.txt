[3:01:33] mCerti: Why tank the runners' % so low that people won't want to push? Is it not a bigger money maker than weed?
[3:02:02] Rool_Gonzalez: 45 min cook I believe @martymagoo78 and finding resources is "ranked" the higher you are the faster you find

[3:11:23] LietK: @Qubeox yeah reverse marginal tax
[3:11:33] qvbxx: exactly
[3:11:43] manueI_: it would be so much easier if everybody followed the system
[3:11:47] SpilledNuts: the main thing is that only GiGi needs to know every number, everyone else just needs to track their shit
[3:12:02] Sword_Scream: The problem is people talk about problem A, Arush starts injecting problem B, and dabbles a little in problem C, and then Lang gives an answer on problem D
[3:12:05] Zechss_: I just make my money, pay it in, i get back what i get back
[3:12:06] Zechss_: done
[3:12:10] Zechss_: XD fuck the headaches
[3:12:14] iby_oogy: Wait so does Harry have to give the crew a 40% cut instead of a 30% cut now
[3:12:28] JMaker24: @sword_scream lang is always confused
[3:12:28] Sword_Scream: The systems are great, people are overthinking and not communicating properly
[3:12:29] Rool_Gonzalez: why I can't wait for Luci to get his own room and stash deerheads there
[3:12:30] mCerti: Lang just seems to have it in his mind that moonshine is the reason weed is failing
[3:12:36] korked: i filled my tow truck with crates so i'll be running bottles all night probally. but it should be about 40k
[3:12:38] djerbis: but if you give dirty money to the crew you should also take off the % of cleaning
[3:12:44] GreasySlothKing: money a,ways a headaches
[3:12:46] Miffmac: @iby_oogy no the they take the 10% from the pushers
[3:12:55] korked: lol
[3:13:13] pqm11: its good rp at the end of the day
[3:13:37] finsane1: working with alot of people
[3:13:46] Sword_Scream: I honestly think the problem isn't the systems being complicated. It's people not listening and asking about problem B/C/D/E when you're trying to solve problem A.
[3:13:46] SpilledNuts: it's nice that gigi is so competent, you can trust it'll be sorted in the end
[3:13:52] djerbis: i like it, its chaos with no true specialists, cuz its basicaly just a game

[5:35:50] Sword_Scream: Harry, maybe you can give me some insight, considering you're english. Why is it that when I was in England, whenever I got any asian food it came with fries? Like I ordered some orange chicken and it came with fries. I ordered butter chicken, it came with fries. I ordered mongolian beef, it came with fries.
[5:36:41] Sword_Scream: But as the standard!?
[5:36:51] Sword_Scream: yeah, I know
[5:36:56] genrol: man I’d fuck with some butter chicken and fries to be honest
[5:37:01] Sword_Scream: and I know exactly the colour of orange-brown you mean
[5:37:06] ksKaleido: i live in a small town in the US and its like that with burgers, even the chinese place has a burger on the menu its so weird
[5:37:09] andreimyhrer: deep fried
[5:37:11] ZEROINTENNIS: chicken chow mein does fucking slap though

[5:37:25] spudd710: thats so true it hurts lol
[5:37:25] FiniteResources: ever since i went japanese, i never went back
[5:37:26] zzZoolex: butter chicken poutine is fire
[5:37:37] Jookmaster: @genrol its cheap and easy to make at home, freezes well too
[5:37:44] Unemployed666: there’s a video I saw of Chinese take out in England. that was not Chinese food lol
[5:37:44] Drmarshmelluw: UK chinese food looks like resident evil food
[5:37:47] Sinsley: Melvin Saususge
[5:37:50] Sword_Scream: English cousine continues to amaze me. Just if it's from east of poland, you add chips to it.

[5:40:44] alotofrandomcrap: @Niktory aah ok
[5:40:49] Hogie48: Yeah its real cheap, and no diminishing returns
[5:41:24] Hogie48: Yeah i had a couple cotton trees/pigs but havent really bothered with trade packs yet... i should
[5:41:44] Niktory: yea i was just gonna do the farming one at a time so just start with potatoes and then move on once im more established
[5:42:00] Hogie48: I would rather farm mining/logging to make money then trade packs
[5:42:14] Hogie48: Buuuuut I just mindlessly farm mining while I watch you rofl, so its a little easier
[5:42:31] Hogie48: I think copper ore is like 55s each right now
[5:42:45] Hogie48: Yeah its not much
[5:43:10] Sword_Scream: Sound like the opposite of OSRS woodcutting
[5:43:13] Sword_Scream: "You just stand there"
[5:43:20] Niktory: i liked the woodcutting lol
[5:43:23] Hogie48: but I also use the ore to make ingots to get Blacksmithing up lol.   All my grinding doesnt turn in to money, it turns in to crafting levels
[5:43:30] armzie33HD: anyone watch the boxing lol didnt last long

[5:45:39] WillyHi: LUL
[5:45:45] Sword_Scream: @Niktory Yeah, I heard Arush's takes it was some wilding
[5:45:50] Hogie48: Honestly.... if Mike doesnt win, ill just assume he threw for money
[5:45:54] Sword_Scream: I mean Mike ain't in his prime, but he is a GOAT.
[5:46:16] Sword_Scream: And while Jake is good for a youtube boxer... He ain't beating Mike.
[5:46:23] armzie33HD: mike tyson could take jake out fiat punch
[5:46:27] armzie33HD: first
[5:46:28] Jookmaster: mike still trains like crazy
[5:46:30] hamdi0123: harr why no chill music
[5:46:35] Hogie48: Mike may not be in his prime, but he can still demo 99.99$ of people
[5:46:52] armzie33HD: tysons still got that powet
[5:47:07] Sword_Scream: Tyson needs to land ONE good punch, that's it.
[5:47:13] hamdi0123: a ok
[5:47:33] Sword_Scream: And anyone who bets on Jake is either convinced it's a fixed match, or a good bit delulu.
[5:47:33] armzie33HD: if tyson dosent win its a fix for sure
[5:47:53] Jookmaster: nice and quiet around here with k in jail

[5:53:54] umathys: Mike tyson will be 58 lmfao
[5:53:56] exo__23: @mike9904_ no matter what age catches up
[5:54:01] Sword_Scream: @Aumilly I don't think that's necessarily the case. I'm sure he's getting a FAT bag for 30mins of work. I think the rumor is close to 8 digits
[5:54:02] Aumilly: @mike9904_ oh for sure. but Mike is literally 59 years old

[5:54:23] Sablotron: idk how old, washed up, sick, tyson might be, that's a plain and simple death wish.
[5:54:24] BigAmpTrice: I seen a video of Mike training he looked amazing
[5:54:24] CrankySpider: mike still hits like a truck have you seen his training videos
[5:54:40] bndzor: jp is gonna win, he is 30 years younger and has been boxing for some time now, i would even stretch it as far as call him a professional boxer at this time, even if he started as a influencer
[5:54:41] hamdi0123: MOVE SPOTS
[5:54:42] armzie33HD: mike might be old but still got that power
[5:54:45] Niktory: i would not fuck w mike tyson cuh
[5:54:45] Aumilly: @sword_scream the only reason anyone is fighting that dude is because of money and publicity
[5:54:47] Hogie48: Have you seen the tyson training videos?   He may be 59 but he ain't lost it
[5:54:53] OmegamonX: @hamdi0123 shush

[5:55:15] BigAmpTrice: Yeah look what George Forman did at his age
[5:55:17] lorikchan: Cmoin bruh, he is almost 60, i would be surprised if jake doesnt win
[5:55:18] exo__23: training and actual fighting is very different
[5:55:23] rayybaee: hes 57 guys cmon..

Where you'd pay a coin (usually a tenner, so around 1.5 USD) for a lousy burger, like a cheeseburger from them.
