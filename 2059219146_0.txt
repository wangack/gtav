[5:53:30] sickboyeli: @Bashxd_ with some leases you can get very good deals
[5:54:09] Kalmbach: @Bashxd_ Nah they give you a buyout price at the start of the lease.
[5:54:30] swankytiger942221: It's prolly because of red lining it sooo much. She does that alot lmao
[5:55:09] realitijd24: classic 󠀀
[5:55:13] sickboyeli: did X drive it or something OMEGALUL
[5:55:14] ComfyAura: @swankytiger942221 its an auto
[5:55:17] alexlipson: @Bashxd_ yes. but buying the same car will cost 5-7k more + high interest rates in the current market. Essentially, you pay more than the vehicle is worth and you get fucked with interest rates. With leasing, you can lease a vehicle with 0.6 factor of vehicle value with below 1% interest
[5:55:28] realitijd24: master mechanic tho and bench EZ
[5:55:28] susge1: ramee fucked it
[5:55:29] zemog_01: Its probably gonna need an engine swap later on

[5:55:40] ihavokkx: too much repair kits can fuck the engine
[5:56:03] Kalmbach: @Bashxd_ My car was 45k new, i pay $550 a month with 12k miles a year and can buyout after 3year lease ends for 25k. So honestly made out better than financing over 5 years
[5:56:04] BlastedRoyal: OMEGALUL
