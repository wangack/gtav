[0:03:23] marc_avec_un_c: people can vote on what to watch next
[0:03:28] Looking4Misteria: We vote on watching YouTube videos
[0:03:30] Varro_Sicarius: @XENPH0N chat votes on yogs vids to play
[0:03:34] XENPH0N: oh nice
[0:03:41] jtall14: We gon find out
[0:03:57] marc_avec_un_c: i mean you can just watch whatever the hell you want on youtube but it's nice watching different things that gets suggested sometimes :)
[0:04:32] marc_avec_un_c: havent really watched much cinema since the new version but it used to be lots of the same ttt videos.. hopefully the new version fixed that problem, but then again if people vote for them...
[0:05:32] Varro_Sicarius: @marc_avec_un_c that's not really a cinema issue yeah, that's just "people like this so they vote for it" problem
[0:05:52] marc_avec_un_c: yea and to be fair.. unless you're here all the time for the cinema, you wont notice the replays
[0:06:12] marc_avec_un_c: if i come once a week i wont notice it.. 2-3 days in a row, even for just an hour or so, i'll definitely get replays
[0:06:45] Varro_Sicarius: @marc_avec_un_c I mean, if you're in the UK or Europe it's hella late, you're probably just late night vibing and not paying much attention anyhow
[0:06:47] marc_avec_un_c: i really prefer the voting in the new cinema, and being able to change your vote
[0:06:55] marc_avec_un_c: less clunky than typing a long code in chat :p
[0:07:12] marc_avec_un_c: @marc_avec_un_c haha nah i'm in canada, so it's 7.18pm here
[0:07:29] Looking4Misteria: Hey look a non TTT video for our first of the night XD
[0:07:29] Varro_Sicarius: @marc_avec_un_c you can afternoon vibe then :V
[0:07:37] Varro_Sicarius: (also yeah cinema voting now is much better)

[0:08:05] Varro_Sicarius: @Firesire337 to vote you gotta use the extension below
[0:08:57] marc_avec_un_c: dont recall seeing this project winter video... but.. "let's try this harder longer mode"... as if they dont have enough troubles with the base game as it is :p aside from duncan and ped, who play the game regularly on their own channels :p

[0:09:30] Varro_Sicarius: @marc_avec_un_c I'm pretty sure this is an old episode, because these roles pop up pretty commonly now

[0:09:49] marc_avec_un_c: oh yeah it's old, i recall the little secret meeting between ben and tom at the start
