Only the grinder, master of all four Groups, could stop them. But when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred minutes passed and my brother and I discovered the new grinder An civ named Yuno, and although his Civ skills are great he still has a lot to learn before he’s ready to save anyone. But I believe Yuno can save the world.

[0:33:39] Muijf: Even 2.5K is fine. 12.5K for 3 super GPU's that only make 1.2 BUTC/24 hours isn't that much at all. Plus people need to buy the racks as well
[0:33:39] takuu: havent sold anything in 2 days and still not listening

[0:34:36] loot_goblino: yeah he is right
[0:34:38] imhughamongus: @imhughamongus hes acting like ppl who buy are gonna buy 50 buttcoin, thats not gonna happen either, the supply is always gonna be less than demand if the miners keep using their buttcoin
[0:34:39] fbi_case: LETHIMCOOK

[0:35:13] hotpotatohurricane: Volume based pricing is OK
[0:35:13] nickjames69: @0xnovus the price of butcoin will converge to the marginal cost of electricity per BTC + marginal cost of circuit boards per GPU per BTC + cost of GPU blueprint degradation per BTC, which when all said and done is only a couple hundred dollars MAX
[0:35:13] youngvard: When the asset is depreciating you have to foucs on the most profitable part of on it, if you're already all in on it in order t maximise profit. The most profitable parts are the Upgraded GPU's, the racks are being undercutted so you have to focus on the next thing.

[5:08:56] OverhaulEX: The company Old bois Chang Gang Civs Long ago, the four groups lived together in harmony. Then everything changed when the Company attacked. Only the grinder, master of all four Groups, could stop them. But when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred minutes passed and my brother and I discovered the new grinder An civ named Yuno, and although his Civ skills are great he still has a lot to learn before he’s ready to save anyone. But I believe Yuno can save the world.
