[1:17:29] RoguePandaHD: this song is shit
[1:17:30] snailjuice10: you took my streamers gun away why are you so asshole
[1:17:33] xl_scout_lx: Lionel would be a good PD mechanic
[1:17:36] imSteffin: yeah fix your uniform pleb.
[1:17:46] OutKast2: hell yeah
[1:17:47] SurelyBaked: yeah PD def needs a full time mechanic 100%

[1:17:50] Felrane: didn't PD used to have one?
[1:17:52] n0oxaskek: @snailjuice10 muh strimmer gun KEKW
[1:17:55] jacksmithcje: why dont you ask lionel to do this when you are having the next meeting
[1:17:58] the_real_jfk: problem is that they need a group to gather parts
[1:18:03] imSteffin: Was Lionel the one that snitched saying they were going to pull turbos?
[1:18:08] madhatterui: @EsfandTV u should hire a PD pit crew
[1:18:10] BIEM491: @esfandtv are you planning on doing any wow streams?
[1:18:13] AntiMatterTape: @EsfandTV you have to make sure he has enough work to do though, so as a PD policy everyone HAS to get into a wreck before they come back
[1:18:14] chivvyy: i thought they wanted pd to rp in community hubs too
[1:18:23] Zarniwooper: Are mechanics in Mosleys paid by hour?
[1:18:27] Mister_Meatsauce: I'm waiting for the day that the PD is more stable so we can get the return of Conan FeelsStrongMan

[1:18:40] MisterParry: @Zarniwooper by the job
[1:18:40] uselesscanteen: you guys need a Quartermaster as well
[1:18:42] Loco_Cubano: @EsfandTV the PD has that repair area, a mechanic should be able to work out of that and do EVERYTHING. The PD should not be doing business with a mechanic shop, thats insane tbh.
[1:18:42] claptil: R&D team
[1:18:42] rocker22_: Maybe he has a day or two a week
[1:18:43] KappaManJason: riding with anyone today?

[1:19:04] jacksmithcje: what if he does what you are doing quickly next meeting just while you guys our there
[1:19:07] PacGamer: WICKED
[1:19:07] oppositeattractive: Cornwood is basically managing the PD fleet
[1:19:07] Kaseyfullofjoy: PDs do have contracts with them tho IRL
[1:19:09] Felrane: small towns do all the time
[1:19:10] marneraiders: Could give PD maintenance and Parking control

[1:19:27] bigoldmanmeat: not true at all many PDs aout source maintenance to 3rd parties even dealers
[1:19:29] tenuousdante: WHAT? Cops bring their cars in all the time to fleet stores
[1:19:29] Rawhiders69: Its just too much busy work for rp
[1:19:29] Pichoto: PD should have a designated mechanic no?
[1:19:30] Gatorain: pd irl are contracted through local mechanic shops for simple tire/oil stuff.. they have their own dedicated mechanic + shop where they do everything else
[1:19:31] ezrandir: Have you talked to Lienal about it?
[1:19:31] Speeddevilx: pd should have their own mechanic and tow @EsfandTV
[1:19:31] w111iam1: can you hire him?
[1:19:32] Loco_Cubano: @Kaseyfullofjoy no PDs have a motorpool and mechanics of their own.
[1:19:34] jaylop94: Yeah

[1:19:40] DFresh015: pretty much
[1:19:40] jacklee345: Same here
[1:19:41] icetool35: yea
[1:19:41] thekiefthief: LUL
[1:19:42] Felrane: get him hired as PD so he can pull out cars and fix them. Give him a budget and everything
[1:19:42] MurrayInnit88: Yes
[1:19:43] accumulat3: irl (in america) pd would have their own mechanics, we dont have that in rp
[1:19:43] OhMyGawddess: can police hire him as a contractor ?
[1:19:44] GoofyMaskedGoober: yes
[1:19:44] deftcg: Yes

[1:19:51] Gachiguru: ive got almost 5k miles combined on my two trucks
[1:19:52] neptunesstorms: Pd hiring a mechanic would be cool
[1:19:53] rocker22_: if people are upset about the cars they will not be please if the budget comes from the charges etc haha
[1:19:55] zuze: Police do that in the US.. lol
[1:19:55] EastSideBoy651: I would assume they pay a retainer at X mech shop

[1:20:08] Zarniwooper: Cars would be so top notch if there was PD mechanic, he would repair, maintain and even refuel.
[1:20:09] Drunkenhunter2: @Kaseyfullofjoy yea they do

[1:22:40] EastSideBoy651: twitter is the only thing that is changed lmao
[1:22:40] remmus82: Would cornwood know what discord is?
[1:22:42] edenobi: minus one. how dare you.
[1:22:43] ffran7: Youtube is not related to OOC comunication
[1:22:43] RoguePandaHD: erm twitch?
[1:22:44] bechcity: -1 Corwood just learned about ipods but fights for Discord
[1:22:44] ShaneOwens0: cause you actually use discord for ooc convos you don’t use YouTube for ooc convos
[1:22:46] panhever: Discord is the forbidden word
[1:22:46] chiefboof024: discordia
[1:22:46] Wintyer2: and discord could be ripcord
[1:22:47] duck_deficiency: its just that it sounds bad. pd would not have discord. but who fucking cares
[1:22:47] McKibbo: anyone heard of X? is it new?\
[1:22:47] BlakeChaos: they talk about playing league of legends and WoW in game too and nobody cares
[1:22:48] iMoore_: because it’s an outside form of communication that breaks immersion
[1:22:48] vMushuTV: Ok but Cornhub definitely refers to something else
[1:22:49] HeyMeghan: google is gurgle right? so why is discord email and not like dick sword or something
[1:22:50] Janman88: DISCORD COULD BE USED FOR WORK TOO SFU CHAT
[1:22:50] quaylewastaken: Discord = no pixel email service
[1:22:51] Techno_Plumber: Probably because in GTA5 there are IRL knockoff brands. so its just to keep the same Flavor in RP
[1:22:51] viewlessd: @EsfandTV why dont u stop using it ten and use ONLY in game mechanics
[1:22:51] Kiester_Felterbutts: Call it the communication device that shall not be mentioned.
[1:22:52] thechosen1720: esfandOkay
[1:22:53] Drunkenhunter2: just introduce it as this new app called discord :>
[1:22:53] Exotic_Soul: google should be gurgle
[1:22:53] dugdimmadomed: easy to understand
[1:22:53] vellooci: i guess an argument is you aren't talking about youtube/etc in reference to OOC communication
[1:22:54] charybdes: Just RP it, say Cornwood found this thing call Discord and it would be better than emails.
[1:22:54] Janman88: GEEZUS
[1:22:55] rastalano: the app that we do not speak its name!
[1:22:55] SarahFlare: I think it’s because it doesn’t sound official/professional when saying hey I sent that subpoena on discord.
[1:22:55] faroeislands_: There's no use arguing with the RP police
[1:22:56] RoguePandaHD: y’all don’t mention twitch lmao
[1:22:56] ChaoticSanity: maybe because theres alot of ooc drama in discord @EsfandTV
[1:22:56] Dominikun: there should be an ingame name for discord and youtube, like twatter
[1:22:56] chudbungus: I think it's just because it's too close to OOC talk
[1:22:57] thenamelessboss: someone saying "check discord" in rp would kind of throw me off the be fair
[1:22:57] permacool: @EastSideBoy651 gurgle, grime, etc

[1:23:01] TR4FFiq: stinky
[1:23:02] knowlightnofear: I think it's because it's called TWATTER instead of Twitter, it makes people think that nothing else can be referred by name
