Recently I have had a lot of struggles with motivation recently but today I have finally found some to do a few things that I have been putting off. And because of that I realized I have been neglecting the daily reminder for people. I know that sometimes others need a push in the right direction to get started and I want to be there for you all today when I have my own motivation. Make sure to hydrate, eat and self care. Love Sam.

[4:49:03] dylanconlon6: @iamthakingslayer ramee at another bench trial
[4:49:13] bungholeitch: I would love if police pov streams were made available in rp as if they were body cams, and if a lawyer request it they have to provide it. cops can turn them off but they will get in big trouble, maybe fired if it is requested and they had it turned off.
[4:49:13] Kiba_Snow: !backseat
[4:49:13] Fossabot:  whipStinky Please do not tell streamer what to do or how to do it unless specifically asked by streamer, even if he forgets or doesn't see something. Back-seating acts as an unwanted external influence to the roleplay.
[4:49:21] freakinfe3n: @kiba_snow peepoHey
[4:49:37] Damnitben: Cop body cam gets exhausting as hell for reviews

[4:59:27] the1HopeLive: Dundee was pulling away before it blew up
[4:59:29] alienslx: LETHIMCOOK
[4:59:36] lordofspin: the lawyer needs to cast doubt on what actually caused the explosion to the court. it is on him
[4:59:48] ramzee_d: They definitely shot before it blew up
[4:59:56] theextremelylongnamekid: if the seminal blew it up, then the truck would’ve blown up too talking Dundee with it

[5:01:09] shadowvale81: Wouldn't that blow the truck up too?
[5:01:09] kilakyle05: That's a baddddd lie
[5:01:10] DanWahWah: that is not how a trailer works buddy
[5:01:10] TripleSixAkuma_: The weight alone would keep it station
[5:01:10] iPab1o: the trailer was floating
[5:01:11] nl_f0x: He needs toilet paper to wipe his mouth aswell.
[5:01:11] Kn0w1edge: physics doesnt work that way lol
[5:01:16] Thanlen: That makes no sense O.o
[5:01:18] Damnitben: You gotta take them out and show them how a truck works
[5:01:18] hiromatshu: then your truck also blows up but you drove off
[5:01:34] SeanSW19: When a cop just lies there's literally nothing you can do
[5:01:36] DjRetroPhase: AAAA
[5:01:36] ImEvoTv: reverse forward LUL
[5:01:41] freakinfe3n: Uhmmm technically the trailer woumove forward because of the slight slope at front of mosely's
[5:01:42] ramzee_d: What?

[5:03:27] TheJremyShow: Just be a good Dunders in court and let the Lawyer COOK
[5:03:28] CCookiies: ricochet
[5:03:33] DjRetroPhase: i think they are trying to say that you were moving backward as you detached and it conserved momentum
[5:04:11] Pepperwoo: is it not enough to counter claim excessive force or even criminal charges against the officers for shooting live fire at something flammable/explosive?
[5:04:13] TripleSixAkuma_: Momentum doesn't exist like that when dealing with a 2 ton object LUL
[5:04:21] ramzee_d: If it blew up from you"detaching" it and it moving slightly back, it woulda blown you up
[5:04:22] lordofspin: Didnt dundee back into and hit cop cars before hitting the seminole? why did that not blow up the truck but the seminole did?
[5:04:43] freakinfe3n: Whompy you really need to stop being a negative nancy about doj system multiple people have told you it doesn't take as long as it used to in 3.0 SMHing

[5:05:53] shadowvale81: AAAA
[5:05:56] ramzee_d: McNulty's logic:  you detached the trailer and it moved back slightly to detach, then waited for you to pull away to blow up

[5:06:41] kilakyle05: Yeah legally
[5:06:43] Sigfred42: Wouldn't the police cruiser you backed into first blew up the car before the seminol
[5:06:48] Kn0w1edge: @ramzee_d in addition, the slight nudge was enough to blow it up, but not straight up ramming two other cars lol
[5:06:50] CCookiies: it's way more likely that the bullets from their shots ricocheted and hit the tanker
[5:06:52] geckoZen: Dundee's stunt-double EZ
[5:06:54] Gouldiekun: on the next episode of mythbusters
[5:06:54] kilakyle05: For research purposes
