[6:28:56] TastyKudzu: Imagine you rob someone and instead of stealing their key you just copy it and leave it on them so that they don't realize they need to worry about changing locks. Then they're not on alert.
[6:28:56] RefreshingLemonade: If someone doesn't hide the key are you all at risk?
[6:29:04] coldeveryday: @RefreshingLemonade yes
[6:29:17] RefreshingLemonade: @coldeveryday oh my.
[6:29:23] mechabananas: kekw

[6:30:23] Bill_Collector: It would be cool if you could change the key for interior doors
[6:30:32] Bill_Collector: Different key for different rooms
[6:30:34] TastyKudzu: That's why Harry is the riskiest one to get robbed because if they look him up the house is in his name.
[6:30:36] BasedBruh: Unless the owner isnt awake so you gotta hold the house down until they wake up lol
[6:30:43] coldeveryday: @TastyKudzu exactly
[6:30:59] coldeveryday: lang getting robbed today was actually helpful for them to realize that

[8:40:33] nhoc_quay515: lease option
[8:40:34] SergeGray: The never ending battle to stop people driving like maniacs
[8:40:36] obscurewill: the boys were all buying like 4 rentals a piece each tsunami before
[8:40:39] xlDeathst0rmxl: true! and people can go to mechanic shops to repair their cars now instead of constantly renting a cheap one
[8:40:42] noelgnal: would be awesome when you don’t return it after 24h there will be a fee or so
[8:40:42] kessy1893: thing is are you gonna make any money pushing weed or will u have to get a lockpick and steal a car?
[8:40:42] blueberrycl: can you park these ones up ?
[8:40:43] butterflyinmybrain: I wonder what happens when the 24 hrs run out. Is it just gonna disappear?

[8:41:01] Rool_Gonzalez: Rental REP incoming
[8:41:07] nuqz1: are there papers now?
[8:41:07] illerrrr: that would suck if you get a repair charge when you return the car
[8:41:07] iiidaaah: how much trunk space this one got?
[8:41:10] GreasySlothKing: rental rep for good condition returns LUL
[8:41:11] resipitidur: Realistic system i guess
[8:41:12] zandrusz: you should get charged for not returning it or getting it towed ngl
[8:41:13] AdamyaaRawat: maybe a small secuirty deposit you get bck
[8:41:16] TastyKudzu: @seven7y_7 That would be lit. Can only get better rentals if you treat them well.
[8:41:17] quinlynn_: do you get fined if you don’t return within 24hr?
[8:41:18] TeaNMuffins: @spitswap I 100% think this is the real reason as a player on the public server... jfc

[8:41:33] VengeanceUM: i think that should be a thing, encourage people to drive better.
[8:41:37] nsk_envy: If you fuck the rental up it's just gonna cost you. Less braindead drivers hopefully
[8:41:38] scotty2thotty18: Double the actual cost at minimum
[8:41:45] jshwan: had a coworker that would always do donuts on rentals and they banned him LUL
[8:41:45] Kaaylev: I assume that is going with this system as well. Pretty Pog if you ask me

[8:44:11] RKO6301221: even if they did, this area is so big, there's no shot they'd find it anyway lol
[8:44:15] tetrafork: maybe the buds were too dank and the devs pulled it
[8:44:17] its_ajc: Surely
[8:44:21] VengeanceUM: maybe it scuffed from the restart
[8:44:24] BiscuitKnight: maybe it died?

[8:45:15] dude_vaughan: has this been a good grow spot chat sorry havent been on in a few days
[8:45:15] TheRejectsAzFTwitch: Supposed to be persistent through the storm. But hunting is supposed to work too
[8:45:17] jal10000000: The plant so dank it grew legs and ran away

[8:49:31] RKO6301221: even if someone found it, it wouldn't have been done anyway to pick it

[10:03:07] blackfyre_rebel: class politics could be good for union rp
[10:03:15] Decode4: sounds like more taxi rp to me Shruge
[10:03:15] Rool_Gonzalez: Nobody Forces you to RENT rental
[10:03:16] lumimosh: there's public transport and bikes
[10:03:17] TropicalToucan: Also it encourages carpooling, Taxis,
[10:03:19] HallJams: company vehicles are free
[10:03:20] quote_me_if_horsen: if you want cash in np, do something interesting to earn it
[10:03:20] DrakeNightbane: If you can't afford the rental, long term goal should instantly be: Get your own car.
[10:03:20] drizzbot5000: real life economies are broken - does one think that a virtual video game role play server can get it right or better?!
[10:03:22] RMx_o: people can hitchhike
[10:03:22] RagingSantas: Or pool with your friends
[10:03:23] Jjiano: its a trickle down effect. higher rental costs > drives lockpick needs > more material needs > more rp
[10:03:24] bobdang07hd: @chewbaccatits spilt name, I had to do a double take
[10:03:24] tabooshk: Gruber Pog
[10:03:27] kidsuper05: 800 dollars for a day for a rental is fucking nothing idk why people are making it a big deal
[10:03:28] JoeKsova: there are other modes of transportation for a reason
[10:03:29] LivingManiac: it creats more rp with having to get taxis and shit
[10:03:30] FeelsgachiBASSMan: but my juicer cant afford it Chatting its not fair Chatting lower it Chatting i know better Chatting kill a cop Chatting
[10:03:32] BerzerkHitzDiff: Car Pool harrNODDERS

[10:03:35] smolboredom: @FairlyFunnyFelineFriend Cool, thanks for the info BLANKIES
[10:03:38] surelyURjokingMrFeynman: $100 rentals were a gift to get people started for the first month
[10:03:39] lordryoshi: gn everyone
[10:03:41] necro1511: why would you rent a car if you only have 1k in your bank account
[10:03:44] wardenau: exactly, use a train or call a guber,
[10:03:46] Gautvid: The best thing about 4.0 is the struggle
[10:03:48] epic_smee: @DrakeNightbane you cant get one right now. but true
[10:03:49] Eluraeltv: i just want to get high and watch rp
[10:03:51] Mr__Muggles: @NicolaFred u can atleast steal em
[10:03:53] Shepsie: when it was cheaper to buy a new rental than repair or fill up gas that had to be fixed long term
[10:03:55] MrTribal: i bet people gonna carjacking, or lockpick gonna boom soon
[10:03:58] mrdumpling420: Life ain't fair lol
[10:03:59] dezalbos: YAPPP Opinions are like assholes
[10:04:02] makalaus28: It forces people to help each other out, like offering rides, which is good
[10:04:02] boobysmoke: I just got here did Harry buy a car?
[10:04:07] chewbaccaTITS: @bobdang07hd  xD kinda what i was goin for haha
[10:04:09] MadnessQuotient: I love expensive rentals.  I want to see it play out for a few weeks and see how people adapt to it
[10:04:15] RYaeDeN: oh damn, house looks nice
[10:04:16] ghostface910: maybe the devs did it like that to force people to Uber more
[10:04:17] exo__23: @yungsamd17 how do these rentals work?
[10:04:19] lumimosh: i mean imagine being a dev or owner constantly reading that shit
[10:04:19] DrakeNightbane: @epic_smee Yeah, seems cars restocking might be a little scuffed a bit. Even Devs seemed to have trouble restocking.
[10:04:37] vermillionknight: balancing the economy is a thankless job
[10:04:46] shamma656: laod the washers ?
[10:04:46] mrdumpling420: Weed
[10:04:47] Suetek: Devs know what they're doing viewers don't.
[10:04:49] mrdumpling420: Lol
[10:04:51] bobdang07hd: @ghostface910 wait until people actually have to use the train, I hope it gets that far
[10:04:51] NicolaFred: Surely you’d only rent a car if you plan on working gruber…. or you can afford it. the train system is great, I hope they add busses too or you can get a gruber
[10:04:54] necro1511: clean money
[10:04:54] PEEPEETRUCK: houses use actual keys now right? can you lock pick a house someone owns?
[10:04:55] Pepeaboo: load the washers too

[10:05:13] blackfyre_rebel: who puttin they trsah on the damn floor harrP
[10:05:15] Rav3n95: as a dev on the Fivem platfrom myself. I realised you have to be part of the server to realise what have to be done, you can't just make things. You have to understand the enconomy everything.
[10:05:20] LietK: Incentivizing train rp sounds really cool actually
[10:05:22] yungsamd17: @exo__23 you can choose for how long you want to rent and you then keep the car for that time and you can store it garages and have it on phone
[10:05:28] frankprogrammer: sayeedRight sayeedBrapa sayeedLeft
[10:05:38] epic_smee: @Rav3n95 yep.

[10:08:32] Eku007: @Chocoreytu YEP new system, rental papers and rental time. Rentals are like 800$ min now
[10:08:36] epic_smee: @Rav3n95 yep but what i mean, if the entrylevel of cost for everything is really high. the community gets more clingy and you get less money for RP type of deals and people tend to grind more. difficult balance
[10:08:37] StamaasG: Not this early on a sunday
[10:08:43] Kaaylev: @dude_vaughan nice

[10:12:14] endlessbounce: you would never hear the end of it

[10:12:22] Rool_Gonzalez: @Gingerraitus yep

[10:12:35] quote_me_if_horsen: harry learned, but did lang learn?
[10:12:36] awesomephilip11: @necro1511 probabbly just Si and Teddy. Possibly Kenny too.
[10:12:37] difficultsleep3r: You've had your share for the month.

[10:15:35] ganjapanat: Nice
[10:15:36] SergeGray: tow workers down bad
[10:15:41] dezalbos: KEKL Resource dump at apartments
[10:15:43] Kaaylev: I bet it affected server performance as well
[10:15:44] moe0595: pog change
[10:15:52] TropicalToucan: 120% i hated parking at SNR all over the place
[10:15:56] eFooLy: what was the change??
[10:15:56] morgrim1: have to take care of your rental now
[10:15:57] kingtom0063: did they add new rentals?
[10:15:57] civlaz: can u park at all hotspots?
[10:15:58] Mr__Muggles: towers are gonna be doing calls on legally parked cars for sure
[10:15:58] HallJams: do you get a kickback of you return them to the rental spot?
[10:16:06] shamma656: and weed runs in club still viable its just longterm investment and you ahve to care about the car
[10:16:06] kuaci1: good thing about rental car is no asset fee
[10:16:07] dezalbos: W devs EZ Balancing is never perfect though
[10:16:16] Eku007: And at hotspots too, snr buns used to have like 20 rentals scuffing on roadside
[10:16:22] rollindarock: Its good for runners in a way as well as not all running in same cars. Bad that they will have to burn the car after a chase though
[10:16:23] superste63: i wonder if once you get a rental you cant get another untill you return it
[10:16:30] shamma656: yeah if you fuck it you need to repair it
[10:16:30] LietK: Any cool manual cars
[10:16:33] ItsEdBoi_: Wonder if u need to repair it
[10:16:34] kidsuper05: What's the most expensive car on rentals?
[10:16:36] Suetek: its pretty cool
[10:16:46] kingtom0063: that really nice
[10:16:48] skullmeathq: much more realistic imo
[10:16:49] MrProtagonist: seems fair
[10:16:50] AndreSeek: ppl will also need to repair it
[10:16:57] yungsamd17: @LietK all the same old cars just this new Ingot and Speepo van
[10:17:08] dark16sider: I wonder if you cops can see who owns it?
[10:17:10] iLLuSi0NN: I wonder if the car is under your name when cops scan it with radar
[10:17:10] EnzikFires: late fees? haha
[10:17:11] LietK: Ty
[10:17:12] obscurewill: maybe there's repo tow jobs
[10:17:13] shamma656: i reckon once its expired it gets flagged as stolen
[10:17:14] Sicbreed: read the rental papers
[10:17:16] lorikchan: I feel like ita not worth renting for longer period cuz u have to get the repairs for it and ur stuck with it, rather pay every day
[10:17:16] RagingSantas: Wonder if its technically a stolen car at that point
[10:17:22] JoeKsova: I’d love to see some do public transport RP to go around town
[10:17:23] hugmeqt: imagine it just poofs after 24hrs OMEGALUL
[10:17:27] lumimosh: could be late fees or flagged plate
[10:17:27] OniBW: Be sweet if there was a new tow job for repos for people that didn
[10:17:31] TastyKudzu: It makes sense. The gas in the car used to cost more than the car.
[10:17:33] Eku007: @Sicbreed Just says name, plate and expiry date
[10:17:37] skullmeathq: itll prob despawn cause imagine the amount of expired rentals + new rentals

[10:17:44] skullmeathq: big boy lag
[10:17:45] LivingManiac: i doubt late fees as what if u dont wake up for a day
[10:17:49] FeelsgachiBASSMan: late fees, cop pings would actually be a fun thing to watch
[10:17:50] surelyURjokingMrFeynman: @lorikchan it will be cheaper per day if you do multi day rental so not 7x$800
[10:17:50] BlooddMann: it also would be interesting if its not returned its marked stolen to PD
[10:17:52] MrProtagonist: should also be good for mechanics and grubers
[10:17:54] OniBW: Be sweet if there was a new tow job for repos for people that didn't return rentals*
[10:17:59] DeadAssYeetOnEm: Maybe it won't let you rent another 1 if you don't return it since there were times people have taken advantage of the rental nechanic
[10:18:01] EnzikFires: good point
[10:18:07] JoeKsova: does the bus system work? I wish there were buses to  hotspots hunting, part,Mets, buns, mechanic shops etc. that would be cool. people can sign on as bus drivers etc
[10:18:16] Kaaylev: @skullmeathq Not really. Could have bills / repo / etc
[10:18:19] surelyURjokingMrFeynman: can you rent more than one at once?
[10:18:20] superste63: @lorikchan also i wonder if you get charged returning it damaged??
[10:18:24] yungsamd17: @DeadAssYeetOnEm true that NODDERS
[10:18:25] epic_smee: @JoeKsova would be cool
[10:18:26] mrdumpling420: Imagine if the super weed was a giant 20 ft plant lol
[10:18:34] stangracer04: where are you going now?
[10:18:34] TropicalToucan: I wonder if it would like some local cars in 3.0 would poof with your stuff in the glovebox and the world would spawn another car somewhere with the same trunk
[10:18:37] lorikchan: @surelyurjokingmrfeynman yea, but what happens when the 3k repair bill comes on day 5?
[10:18:41] epic_smee: @JoeKsova one bus that runs around the highway into the city would be enough
[10:18:52] stimboxer: if u get some money back then maybe its not that expensive
[10:18:56] BlooddMann: Someone just needs to be a bus driver
[10:18:58] Rool_Gonzalez: Some servers have Rep for Buss drivers as well
[10:19:01] DrakeNightbane: @DeadAssYeetOnEm I would wager a system like that is ez to implement. Cause Mosleys has a system for their test drives like that.
[10:19:01] mrdumpling420: Doyle head
[10:19:04] Eku007: Real people doing routes harrNODDERS
[10:19:11] OwGusson: I hope people will use Guber more now
[10:19:33] Nightbot: If you have Amazon Prime you can sub to Harry for FREE, just go to https://twitch.amazon.com/prime activate it, come back and subscribe free of charge.
[10:19:44] sardoniccult: I think a bus system would be amazing. Have a bus driver job, have to make stops in time, in order to progress and get full pay.
[10:19:45] Rychin247: imagine rental rep, returning a banged up car = losing rep, higher fees on next rental
[10:19:52] JoeKsova: bus stop/ bus RP would be sick
[10:19:52] epic_smee: @OwGusson dont think the guber  app works, or did they fix that

[10:35:20] Aiyrix: Bag to more
[10:35:26] wundo: maybe harvest kit just has a chance to do something but not every time
[10:35:28] Kaaylev: scammed
[10:35:29] negapanda12: maybe it bags more?
[10:35:29] BasH_LuKo: maybe is a bug that you can harvest without a tool?
[10:35:33] chrysanthos_22: indoor?

[10:40:37] yungsamd17: Nerdge 112%
[10:40:41] martcaunton: Maybe the normal seeds can only get you to 100 stars and this seed needs to be grown to gain more rep. So much to figure out. So exciting
[10:40:52] Mr__Muggles: how many 10%ers are at the bottom of the ocean
[10:40:57] lyzan42: actual advanced seeds require less pest control, sometimes none at all
[10:41:05] OniBW: The upkeeps more now though so hopefully it's worth it

[10:41:22] quote_me_if_horsen: or maybe its for more stars
[10:41:28] jamalalimirza: may it needs the medium rack to dry to give good quality when dried.
[10:41:58] mrdumpling420: Harry needs a quick 100k loan lol any loan agencies out yet
