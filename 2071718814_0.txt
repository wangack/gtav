[1:21:06] jimothy64: Stairs could go a step lower, might be enough?
[1:21:40] QuesoCommander: that plus pushing it back a smidge into the room area
[1:21:52] jimothy64: Can the top ones go lower at all?
[1:22:12] IosefSerov: Not a Smol step... nakkiLaugh

[1:22:56] QuesoCommander: this works though, just need to find the sweet spot
[1:23:22] CrisKross99: dang it would be nice to have a curving stair piece to connect the two and continue going down
[1:23:23] jimothy64: Could still work, nudge everything to the left (as you enter) a tiny bit so the door clears the bottom of the second step of the top stairs
[1:23:55] IosefSerov: Are spiral stairs an available model?
[1:24:05] Bwldrd1: Not scaleable?
[1:24:08] IosefSerov: D'oh
[1:24:38] QuesoCommander: actual spiral staircase would probably take like 12 "stairs" to make due to the way the items work
[1:24:58] IosefSerov: Hmm
[1:25:07] CrisKross99: the solution is just make this a parkour entry. only the strong can go inside nakkiVERYNOTFINE

[1:26:09] QuesoCommander: definitely doable nodd
[1:26:12] jimothy64: I think it can if you move the top stairs to the left a little
[1:26:22] jimothy64: The floor above can move to meet them
[1:26:34] TheJRoller: might need single stair at a time
[1:26:50] jimothy64: Uh.. left as you enter the house.. so towards the balcony
[1:27:54] jimothy64: Yeah, the floors can move to meet the top of them, then the door has more clearance
[1:28:02] lch4osl: @ALL
[1:28:09] lch4osl: lul
[1:28:14] IosefSerov: I wondered if a bunch of little stairs could do in sequence, but I assume that has its own constraints to it.
[1:28:51] IosefSerov: Stair sections I mean
[1:29:11] TheJRoller: nakkiHappyClap
[1:30:18] jimothy64: Eh, it's an understair room, it was probably always gonna have some weird shapes
[1:30:25] QuesoCommander: probably more roomy than the loft ceilings
[1:31:04] jimothy64: Then where that staircase comes up almost serves as a natural divider between living space and kitchen/work space

[1:40:26] IosefSerov: I don't think we've heard anything back yet. nakkiShrug
[1:40:34] jimothy64: Don't forget the inside corner above the stairs can be floored over for tessellation space
[1:40:56] dbnite: ghosts in the flors
[1:41:52] TheJRoller: rails
[1:42:11] jimothy64: That space is either your worst enemy or best friend for wiggle room with the floors lol

[1:46:43] TheJRoller: YES!
[1:46:45] jimothy64: I was just thinking that
[1:47:17] jimothy64: I've definitely been in places with that kind of floating divider staircase thing
[1:47:37] jimothy64: The sharpness of these particular stairs is concerning though
[1:47:46] QuesoCommander: kinda like it, but kinda weird without a proper landing
[1:48:05] TheJRoller: dont connect but do the switch 90?

[1:57:01] jimothy64: So suggestion; do the small then large staircase corner, have it finish opposite the loft, then have a sort of loft balcony wrap-around to meet the staircase
[1:58:01] QuesoCommander: better use of the space with it over the stairs already
[1:58:11] ThatSoKyuRo: nice 👍
[1:58:27] Bindeir: nodd
