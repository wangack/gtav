[1:04:34] d00b3rr: People won't care who you are if they think it's worth it
[1:04:37] Knallenstein: I mean... that will only work for a single person... not for a gang
[1:04:38] darkestnight333: @Knallenstein sometimes, you have to remind people why they shouldn't touch you, you have to remind them why your group is above reproach

[1:08:43] FriskiestSpoon: also since robbing sani has been free guarantee they aren't looking out
[1:08:55] eborcurean: the yakuza are an organised criminal cartel. while they might not be robbing people on street corners, they defend themselves and their business interests.
[1:09:06] SpectreUK: Gonna have to turn the mosleys factory into an ammunition factory Evilowo

[3:52:04] Rover_X_Rover: fricc being first too much of headache imo
[3:52:05] bwehn: i don't even think theres a point to really being first in heist progression anyway
[3:52:05] shpuddie: nodd not even that far behind honestly either, yall can hit the launder pretty wuickly now
[3:52:09] eborcurean: no one has as much property, like not even close

[3:52:16] Sahneee: well at least "turf"
[3:52:17] BladedBuzzer: being first doesn't get you anything really shrujj
[3:52:19] Archangelos1: KC can do heist in their own pace. fricc the competition.
[3:52:26] MaffieNZ: encourage the heishi and shatei to build up the second mining operation in the new house, done
[3:52:27] treeshark: I meant more for the claim not a mechanic
[3:52:28] rmcgowan: And honestly, the houses are arguably more important then the heist progression because those houses are such a limited resource. They tend to never change hands once bought
[3:52:32] Fr0stwav3: shrujj it was in the past so who knows
[3:52:35] eborcurean: it doesn't have to be mechanics as much as the rp of owning a lot
[3:52:39] Vadoctrax: owning the most houses in a place limits the number of bad actors moving in for sure
[3:52:47] Syncrostrike: It's probably way better if it doesn't have mechanics and can just be for RP
[3:52:50] ViolentAkuma: With how fast everything seems to be going I wonder if Koil's plan for a wipe every 6 months will be a thing.

[3:53:18] kakka_pylly: you're like a week behind people who are speed running it, but still ahead of a lot of people
[3:53:23] doccthunder: that sounds like dogshit

[3:53:26] Sahneee: yeah that sounds aweful

[3:53:49] Archangelos1: So much grind in so little time.
[3:53:50] HotCocoaGamer: Constant grind to have something isn't fun
[3:53:51] prodiac: Considering how PD is still in shambles and not even established, I don't know how they could wipe every 6 months.
[3:53:51] Archangelos1: KEKW
[3:53:54] eborcurean: yeah i don't know where that comes from it's anti-rp
[3:53:54] Gemma_LFK: yeah that sounds awful
[3:53:54] Isen_Mage: it also just kills all long term storylines
[3:53:56] cuyliebear: If you do 6 month wipes, then you really need to up the ability to unlock stuff fast and whatever
[3:54:08] ViolentAkuma: For some reason it feels like it hasn't been that long.

[3:55:07] SenorTaavi: Listening
[3:55:08] ben0809: Listening
[3:55:20] Vadoctrax: If it was going to be wiped every 6 months there'd be no grinding. Or grinding would be faster and people would have millions
[3:55:37] ADStrike: @doccthunder I 100% can see this not wipe until gta6
[3:55:45] Vadoctrax: The progression right now is pretty slow and steady.

[7:50:11] NitroC3LL: i mean that advice is kind of sound depending on if normal civilians have a way to sustain themselves
[7:50:13] villainousone: Mechanic Union!?
[7:50:28] tigerland06: PD cars going unfixed would be bad
[7:50:34] Khaza_: Strike just makes literally everyone repair their own shit
[7:50:53] Tronno: YEP
[7:51:11] shpuddie: so just dont do what you want to do and hope it gets helped later?
[7:51:53] KewlKittyProductions: time to open up in MP
[7:51:55] Lord_Legolas: yea, if Rusty prices were like 200-300. hmm
[7:51:56] deathyzz07: i mean can you ask for a business operationg of mosley not owning it

[7:55:50] aluckynewb: so license is kinda useless them? xd
[7:55:57] eqnjn: Maybe like a mechanics union or something could be a thing and it would be 'free'
[7:56:10] mugcostanza: kyliebHmm
[7:56:13] NitroC3LL: nodd
[7:56:15] Tronno: NODDERS
[7:56:18] illifis: Yeah, it would leave room for others to move in
[7:56:20] ViolentAkuma: You make good money now yeah
[7:56:28] Boltaction_Babe: even having personal storage locker would help A TON
[7:56:30] SpectreUK: Mary just needs the ability to fire people etc
[7:56:30] Sonaro8: Personal lockers would be huge enough as a minimum
[7:56:32] Stoney_Mahoney: Mary needs a bit of power at Mosley's
[7:56:35] PsychoBKilla: nodd
[7:56:39] BladedBuzzer: parts make okay money, mechanics make okay money its just very bleh
[7:56:42] mugcostanza: kyliebList ye
[7:56:47] Vatinius: the 'hard' part is 'forcing' (maybe the not the right word) the labor fee on people?
[7:56:51] ibruticus: Licenses really seem like they're gonna be useless unless it comes with mechanical benefits for the business
[7:56:52] deathyzz07: i mean could you make a parts sale business
[7:57:04] Devaleth: imagine a world without the 100 thousand ? parts you and the crew have produced
[7:57:04] eborcurean: problem is max doesn't care, despite all his promises before
[7:57:08] MurphyDH: The ppl are saving money by not paying import cost
[7:57:16] Isen_Mage: YEP
[7:57:18] NitroC3LL: yeah it gets weird not being able to manage who gets hired or not and the handling of the business income
[7:57:18] BladedBuzzer: not really
[7:57:19] ibruticus: YEP
[7:57:19] captaincameron: need a bonus from the state from keeping the city from burning
[7:57:20] ViolentAkuma: Yeah
[7:57:22] prozorftw: YEP
[7:57:29] Archangelos1: YEP
[7:57:30] Isen_Mage: just continue selling parts to people working at Mosley's it changes literally 0
[7:57:34] eborcurean: yeah licenses atm are worse than not having one
[7:57:34] Stoney_Mahoney: I don't like those questions "don't you have a house?" .. so what? its still stupid how Mosley works
[7:57:39] Isen_Mage: not like there's any competition anyway
[7:57:41] natrakjartan: is the buisness account no somthing you guys want ?
[7:57:46] L4zyb4ssturd: keep doing what you're doing, dont even need to be clean either
[7:57:49] mugcostanza: ye
[7:57:50] Myki_Cameda: the points she made to Lionel before the courthouse: Bank account, electronic payment, parts storage, QOL improvements that make it functionable
[7:57:57] triggerpoint007: Yeah I mean mary can still be the part supplier without a licence
[7:58:00] KewlKittyProductions: yeah
[7:58:01] ibruticus: yeah
[7:58:02] Boltaction_Babe: yeah..
[7:58:04] Syncrostrike: 400k investment, now it's time for some payoff and recognition.
[7:58:09] Devaleth: also - how to fix it 1. Break the law. 2. don't work there
[7:58:12] neonishere32: good stream Kylie
[7:58:15] Devaleth: liek ???
[7:58:15] MJ77seven: stream was fun kyliebCozy
[7:58:15] tigerland06: you wanted tools to make the business easier to run, not necessarily to make more money
[7:58:18] shpuddie: you ate dinner so why care about world hunger? its succh a bad arguement
[7:58:20] ELTanqu3: didnt he ask that bc mary said she makes no money
[7:58:21] Myki_Cameda: you have a house, car, and a wife, why do you still need a business?
[7:58:24] eborcurean: @natrakjartan you are worse off having a business license than not, there is no reason to have one
[7:58:24] Stoney_Mahoney: but you are a warrior for doing it
[7:58:25] Tronno: Mary also has almost 30 ppl that helped
[7:58:26] awe_rora: don’t need to worry about staying clean tho kyliebEz
[7:58:27] AetherMana: PD and EMS would kinda be hard to exist
[7:58:27] neonishere32: it was fun hanging out today kyliebCozylove
[7:58:33] omnynous: I feel like the Rusty Price is due for an inflation update
[7:58:40] mugcostanza: yuh
[7:58:41] FeelsKampeTaMan: sounding like blizzard devs right there " dont u guys have phones?" peepoGiggles
[7:58:43] Marshall2: technically Mary is still in the negative
[7:58:43] ibruticus: YEP
[7:58:46] prozorftw: yep
[7:58:46] KewlKittyProductions: she really doesn't make much money with the mechanic stuff
[7:58:48] spicychickenzz: YEP
[7:58:48] mugcostanza: it was a rough start
[7:58:49] eborcurean: he just didn't care
[7:58:56] FriskiestSpoon: yes you have found success, doesn't change the fact that the system is dumb
[7:59:19] FIunkifer: mechanic is really not a viable job unless youre buying parts from mary or gathering mats for parts yourself which is way worse than just selling CBs
[7:59:21] Tronno: @eborcurean There's nothing he can do
[7:59:27] eqnjn: @eborcurean he legit is powerless to do anything sadly
[7:59:27] SpaceWizard710: pog a washing machine got made
[7:59:30] MurphyDH: I'd say he doesn't really care tbf
