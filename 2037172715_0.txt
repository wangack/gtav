[4:30:30] dosk2: rockstar would never unfortunately
[4:30:31] Danjames2015: console is where the sales come
[4:30:32] blackops567: you're dreaming more than denzel's promotion
[4:30:33] Xellwrath: If GTA 6 comes out early 2025, then late 2025 PC version is possible though unlikely
[4:30:36] theblackdog808: It's easy money
[4:30:37] HarryPatel: regular folks dont have gaming pcs
[4:30:37] bloomz0: more players on console 100%
[4:30:37] Caeros: maybe it gets exclusive RP, with 10 dlcs
[4:30:41] thomas1874x: Console will out sell pc by miles
[4:30:42] j0k3rhub: u would be 35 by then bro

[4:30:45] saulcantoral: where the action at??
[4:30:45] carparker76: @Deansocool they do 1 year on console first then pc so you have to buy the game twice. they get way more sales
[4:30:45] scootypebbles92: Rockstar wants to charge people subscription for playing GTA 6 I heard
[4:30:46] StrawHatShaneo: It took them ages just to get GTA 5 to PC
[4:30:47] audy: console will outsell
[4:30:49] WildWillie419: They bought FiveM but don’t they hate Nopixel? LUL
[4:30:50] stjarn1: if they make people buy it on console first, they can sell it 2 times to people

[4:30:53] audy: 100%
[4:30:56] alekxx__: id say late 26 early 27
[4:30:57] Xellwrath: @HarryPatel Regular folks are not the target market
[4:31:00] Defonicx: rockstar makes deals with console companies to keep the game exclusive to consoles for a period prior to releasing on pc
[4:31:00] zMalloc: Pc gtav was a year later. Will be the same I suspect
[4:31:03] StrawHatShaneo: Like a year after
[4:31:06] Chillinoverhere: a year later
[4:31:06] iversxn_: 2yrs later
[4:31:06] grntcr: like years after
[4:31:08] Defonicx: gta 5 was a year after console
[4:31:08] ramsin50: gta 5 was released 2 years later
[4:31:08] thomas1874x: year after
[4:31:08] just_ish: RDR2 Took a year
[4:31:08] nationas: at least a year later
[4:31:09] venomag_: same month
[4:31:09] Ezi_GG: pc be like 2026 or 2027
[4:31:09] R5F_: year after
[4:31:11] Xellwrath: A year and some change later probably
[4:31:12] w1nter_16: because of low profits rockstarr has no intentions of making PC so far tho @Deansocool
[4:31:13] HarryPatel: @HarryPatel what i mean is the gaming community is not heavily pc
[4:31:13] Imnotkarthik: i think 2 years after
[4:31:15] audy: year after LUL
[4:31:16] Gimiix: april 2014
[4:31:17] SKejDee: its harder to optimize on pc thats why
[4:31:17] Lord_Legolas: 2015
[4:31:17] lilbigdrako: Probably 2026
[4:31:17] MattyPTDunne8: 2015
[4:31:18] HyperPerky: Its Console exclusive
[4:31:18] TokyoWrldd: 2015 April
[4:31:19] venomag_: oh my bad
[4:31:19] Sonicfear: if PC comes 2025, then GTARP 2028-2029.
[4:31:19] audy: they dgaf LUL
[4:31:20] BDG_Toa676: HA
[4:31:20] Athasin: https://www.twitch.tv/cyr/clip/BeautifulJoyousUdonNononoCat-Iix45Xv4LgP7QRbh

[4:31:21] Gimiix: 2015*
[4:31:25] audy: YEP LUL
[4:31:29] StrawHatShaneo: Yep
[4:31:29] Matosere: wait thats some bullshit
[4:31:30] NikTw1tch: YEP
[4:31:30] Xellwrath: Probably
[4:31:30] R5F_: nah
[4:31:31] lilbigdrako: yea
[4:31:33] Chillinoverhere: 6.0
[4:31:33] audy: p5 on top
[4:31:35] FatherIan65: probs
[4:31:35] audy: EZ
[4:31:36] Danjames2015: No pixel 2030
[4:31:37] R5F_: Prolly will still be 4
[4:31:38] thomas1874x: probably
[4:31:39] grntcr: Gonna have 7.0 on GTA V
[4:31:39] ramsin50: gta 6 will probably be only one year later
[4:31:40] AndersElias1: 2015
[4:31:41] Defonicx: probably
[4:31:42] Xellwrath: NoPixel 6 will be on GTA 6. kinda fitting tbh haha KEKW
[4:31:42] gamingjoseph1924: hi
[4:31:42] miguel_taffy123: no pixel gta 6 in 2030 buddy
[4:31:43] SameAsEveryOtherDay: 2028 AINTNAURWAY
[4:31:47] Imnotkarthik: AND also think about the programming time they need as well @Deansocool
[4:31:47] Beho_7: GTA5 was never meant for PC that’s why it took so long
[4:31:49] HyperPerky: No pixel wil happen 2030 on gta 6
[4:31:50] audy: EZ P5 on top
[4:31:52] Shokoproko: Hi @Deansocool Sending love from Poland aka. Kurwaland Kappa
[4:31:52] Banchu: yes
[4:31:55] Evezh_: PC was not nearly as big in 2013 tho
[4:31:58] theblackdog808: Remember, the nopixel guys have to figure out the code too, if it's available in the first place lol
[4:32:00] widbar: Rockstar milking GTA 5 LUL
[4:32:01] AlienatedFL: It will come to Console first because the dev cycle is much easier to do with PC or Console (and harder to do on both) so they port the game. @Deansocool
[4:32:02] StrawHatShaneo: Maybe you'll get a promotion before then
[4:32:02] iversxn_: Cause Console games make more oney
[4:32:07] scootypebbles92: It takes time to create scripts lol
[4:32:08] BDG_Toa676: Don't ya have a console Deano
[4:32:09] m4l1kkk: Tim Cook said you can pre-order the Apple Vision Pro deansoMoney
[4:32:15] monkeymeen5: Yoo
[4:32:15] xsilas43: they can and will
[4:32:18] Gaulty33: your close to 40 when nopixel comes @Deansocool LUL
[4:32:20] venomag_: I am gonna be a Dad by then
[4:32:20] Xellwrath: @Beho_7 I don't believe this for a second.
[4:32:21] HarryPatel: you think way too far ahead tbh
[4:32:21] TheS1lentPuppet: Most likely
[4:32:22] R5F_: Nobody cares about rp its gta 6
[4:32:24] HyperPerky: They first make it to PC then farm the hell out of it then bring out mods
[4:32:26] buttcrummbs: can someone explain the difference from no pixel and just gta?
[4:32:27] Imnotkarthik: I mean they did buy FiveM so ...hopefully it wont be that late
[4:32:27] m4l1kkk: You have a PS5 behind you, buddy
[4:32:27] Chillinoverhere: They do not like RP that they dont own
[4:32:30] qats: The console was 17 September 2013 and PC was 14 April 2015
[4:32:30] audy: they gonna make all the pc players bust out the p5 KEKW
[4:32:32] Athasin: GTA 6 is coming 2026 for PC
[4:32:32] theblackdog808: Console's too tempting, they make people buy both console and pc
[4:32:33] SrHuncho: yall are basing this off 2013 when gaming wasnt huge
[4:32:34] bravo_gg: does nopixel pay rockstar lmao?!
[4:32:36] ramsin50: nopixel will have to be 2027 minimum
[4:32:43] Defonicx: unless nopixel gets direct high level support from rockstar I wouldn’t expect to see it before 2028 on gta 6
[4:32:43] xsilas43: @Chillinoverhere, they bought the fivem devs so they do own it now
[4:32:45] BAKAlakakaa: the sad part its the truth haha
[4:32:48] combattingjosh: @R5F_ Care enough for Rockstar to buy them lol
[4:32:53] Frog69: @SrHuncho ? omE2
[4:32:54] StrawHatShaneo: I would imagen gta 6 will do crazy number streaming wise
[4:32:55] BDG_Toa676: Damn didn't know that was a thing for PC and GTA
[4:32:55] WildWillie419: Rockstar doesn’t like anything they’re not collecting direct cash from
[4:32:57] lilbigdrako: I was in high school when GTA5 came out and I will be 30 when GTA6 comes out. Ain't that some shit
[4:32:57] kingscarycow: NGL I feel like Chat is just chatting and dont really know nothing
[4:32:59] audy: RP is on the back of their mind
[4:33:03] Xellwrath: They double dip with delayed releases on different platforms.
[4:33:08] HyperPerky: gta 6
[4:33:09] BAKAlakakaa: ERP
[4:33:10] Sonicfear: It depends on how much support Rockstar puts forth, they have mapped out stuff which hints at direct support for  GTARP servers. That could reduce the development time.
[4:33:11] Xellwrath: Some people are going to buy it on console and PC
[4:33:11] audy: gta 6
[4:33:12] xsilas43: keep playin 4.0 KEKW
[4:33:12] HarryPatel: bruh 4.0 will run 5 years KEKW
[4:33:13] audy: p5
[4:33:13] ramsin50: 3.5 more years before nopixel on gta 6
[4:33:14] dnoltie: Just the sad reality is all. Won't be seeing no pixel gta 6 for atleast another 4 years.
[4:33:15] R5F_: @R5F_ yeah but they care about console more thats the sad part
[4:33:15] Imnotkarthik: ERP CAUGHT
[4:33:17] ItsSkaara: vanilla online
[4:33:18] theblackdog808: Wdym play here lol
[4:33:19] AtsBucky: pc wpnt see gta untiil 2027 at least
[4:33:20] audy: p5 gta 6
[4:33:21] Athasin: Only reason it was almost 2 years for PC release of V is because next gen consoles released. If next gen consoles don't release in 2026, then 6 is coming to PC in 2026
[4:33:22] R5F_: gta online is fun
[4:33:24] yul1x: irl rp
[4:33:25] AlienatedFL: You're gonna play this lol
[4:33:25] the__misfit: Aware
[4:33:26] R5F_: gta 5 online was good
[4:33:26] danielb2705: Touch grass
[4:33:27] westkous: cut videos for variety streamers
[4:33:28] m4l1kkk: You can still be a pretend cop on GTA 5, buddy
[4:33:29] StrawHatShaneo: Among us 💀
[4:33:29] Defonicx: take a year off and travel
[4:33:32] audy: yes bro
[4:33:35] audy: money talks
[4:33:35] HarryPatel: CAP
[4:33:40] HarryPatel: online made them money
[4:33:40] audy: not more thank shark cards
[4:33:41] m4l1kkk: Cap
[4:33:41] Athasin: Shark cards have made them more
[4:33:42] Frog69: how ?
[4:33:42] Defonicx: not really
[4:33:42] HyperPerky: nooooo
[4:33:43] venomag_: how
[4:33:43] theblackdog808: Gta5 came out in 2013 and we're STILL on here
[4:33:44] Jurgen___: maybe you can get a promotion before gta 6 releases on pc
[4:33:44] AlienatedFL: Do a GTA 6 campaign stream
[4:33:45] audy: shark cards>>>>
[4:33:47] bloomz0: shark cards
[4:33:47] bravo_gg: how has rp made them money?
[4:33:50] scairyterry: brother Card Sharks lmao
[4:33:51] m4l1kkk: Everyone owned GTA before RP
[4:33:52] ramsin50: it hasn't made them any money
[4:33:53] AtsBucky: naaah playing gta V online on console has made them money
[4:33:53] HarryPatel: shark cards made them bank
[4:33:53] combattingjosh: @R5F_ Because making games is easy for console. They then can be ported over to PC.
[4:33:54] RoyceAronii: just stream it
[4:33:54] just_ish: They are gonna make a billion in one day they dont need money
[4:33:56] yaboiburaking: Nah man they release it on both pc and ps5 at the same time. Market demands for the game on PC are way too high. Rockstar isn't Sony or Microsoft.
[4:33:56] BDG_Toa676: Idk about that
[4:33:57] BAKAlakakaa: IRL Streams tho
[4:33:58] JeePecks: NO PTO?
[4:33:59] audy: shark cards >
[4:33:59] Cosm1cChaos1: Rp has made them pennies compared to everything else
[4:34:00] AlienatedFL: There's no vacation in streaming lol
[4:34:04] miguel_taffy123: dean travel vlogs deansoHeart2 deansoHeart2
[4:34:04] Athasin: @Deansocool Play normal GTA Online
[4:34:04] Wicketw: GTA6 will probably have built in RP servers but they'll be monetized out the ass
[4:34:04] SharePeace: yeah compared to shark cards
[4:34:06] serioushustle: stream while on vacation
[4:34:06] ramsin50: no pixel 5.0 on gta 5 and nopixel 6.0 on gta 6
[4:34:06] AlienatedFL: you get a fat haircut if you take off
[4:34:07] Calibraso: shark cards make it
[4:34:07] m4l1kkk: People owned GTA 5 copies way before RP was a thing
[4:34:10] JeePecks: No paid time off?
[4:34:11] Defonicx: you could do IRL streaming and travel lol
[4:34:12] AtsBucky: fiveM is pocket money to eockstar
[4:34:13] TheMagnificentBastard: Any erp?
[4:34:14] Xellwrath: @yaboiburaking absolutely no shot
[4:34:16] audy: shark cards makes 800 million a year
[4:34:16] HyperPerky: Meet up with OTK members KEKW
[4:34:16] AtsBucky: rockstar
[4:34:17] zMalloc: Or will make them lots of money. In 2027
[4:34:17] NikTw1tch: COPIUM
[4:34:18] Beho_7: no chance
[4:34:18] lilbigdrako: naaa
[4:34:21] HarryPatel: naaaa
[4:34:21] serioushustle: no shot
[4:34:21] yul1x: a dream
[4:34:21] Defonicx: nope they’re not
[4:34:22] bravo_gg: how does rp make them money? people just buying copies of the game to rp?
[4:34:23] stubixcube: deffo wont be at the same time
[4:34:23] StrawHatShaneo: Nah, doubt it
[4:34:24] scairyterry: COPIUM
[4:34:24] trinimini10: they wont do that
[4:34:24] osirion1: make less moneyld
[4:34:25] Tyberious79: they cant
[4:34:25] nationas: big cope
[4:34:25] THE_Palmer1452: Cope
[4:34:25] HarryPatel: nope
[4:34:25] R5F_: Can u drive
[4:34:26] m4l1kkk: Xbox is not getting it LUL
[4:34:27] Athasin: Nah, console is coming a year later 2026
[4:34:28] Tray2DaWorm: they said no PC at launch
[4:34:28] HyperPerky: never if they did it would be cool
[4:34:28] yul1x: YES
[4:34:28] ExcelEntei_: Wishful thinking
[4:34:28] R5F_: omE2
[4:34:28] seb_thecrab: no way they will
[4:34:29] ramsin50: they already said only on consoles
[4:34:29] ItsSkaara: They didn't do that for any other games
[4:34:30] audy: dumb move
[4:34:30] Tyberious79: rage sucks to much
[4:34:30] zMalloc: No way
[4:34:32] celestedgaf7: not happening
[4:34:32] miguel_taffy123: nah its already been annouced ps5 only
[4:34:33] THE_Palmer1452: Be at least a year after
[4:34:35] cravi: bro of course pc gta 6 will come out earlier than gta 5 of release, the demand is way higher now there was no RP hype back then @deansocool
[4:34:36] HarryPatel: console will always be priotized
[4:34:37] Defonicx: they get paid massive ammounts of money to make it console exclusive @deansocool
[4:34:37] audy: sony already is paying
[4:34:37] JeePecks: PC first
[4:34:38] m4l1kkk: Xbox is not getting GTA 6 LUL
[4:34:38] theblackdog808: I hope you're right, but they would be dumb to do so
[4:34:40] 3rdlegfred: they said console first the a year later pc
[4:34:40] mynameismikeyd: nah PC is always later with AAA games as there are more hoops to jump through
[4:34:41] Imnotkarthik: NOoooo they make the most money with Playstation and XBox. Once they release to PC its all Over
[4:34:42] audy: Sony pays for this
[4:34:42] Xellwrath: It's been confirmed that they won't release on PC and console at the same time. Unless there is a mass riot about it and literally nobody buys it on console @Deansocool
[4:34:43] Athasin: Nah console first in 2025 and then PC in 2026
[4:34:43] cravi: everyone saying different is faded
[4:34:44] Panos_97: DO IT
[4:34:46] trinimini10: probably ps5 first, then xboc/pc
[4:34:47] combattingjosh: Sony will have the contract again
[4:34:48] ramsin50: they confirmed no pc release in 2025
[4:34:49] serioushustle: @Deansocool On the GTA 6 trailer, it only shows PS5 and XBOX, not PC
[4:34:50] BDG_Toa676: deansoP deansoP
[4:34:50] Sonicfear: That is some copium thinking there LUL
[4:34:50] seb_thecrab: they've already announced that its console only on release
[4:34:51] bloydy2: nick is never moving back from norway
[4:34:52] ahabxd: they make more money not releasing at the same time
[4:34:54] Antollyme: Its confirmed on their website its Xbox and PS only on release.
[4:34:55] zMalloc: They have never done pc at the same time with any of their games
[4:34:56] AlienatedFL: You can vacation and do IRL content
[4:34:58] Ezi_GG: he never coming back from norway
[4:34:59] JeePecks: WOW
[4:35:00] Lopylobster: console release first, then PC, they can double dip the market, easy easy
[4:35:02] JeePecks: No PC 2025
[4:35:03] audy: Sony and Rockstar are tight
[4:35:05] Beho_7: didn’t they already say it’s releasing on consoles first?
[4:35:09] HyperPerky: They need money @Deansocool They bring it out on console then 2 years later on pc then 1.5 years later mods will come
[4:35:12] ankyid14: Wait i just got here what happened?
[4:35:13] BAKAlakakaa: @Antollyme lol
[4:35:14] Tray2DaWorm: R* said PC Port is more difficult and makes less money then the consoles at the start
[4:35:15] Lopylobster: 2 months
[4:35:16] JeePecks: 4.0 gonna stretch whilst it's out
[4:35:16] Panos_97: About two months now
[4:35:31] ramsin50: @audy it's on xbox as well
[4:35:34] f0rbin: he's been there just over a month
[4:35:34] Lord_Legolas: no. it's 1 month
[4:35:39] Defonicx: people buy multiple copies of the game (one on console at release and another for pc) by not releasing on pc at same time
[4:35:40] Xellwrath: About 2-3 years after GTA 6 drops we can probably expect RP servers to start popping up.
[4:35:52] beastly_kush: @Xellwrath ye
[4:35:52] Panos_97: Not gonna happen sadly
[4:35:53] HarryPatel: we got to wait for trailer 2
[4:35:57] Imnotkarthik: once it comes on PC you already know there will be millions pirating it
[4:35:58] ramsin50: when there is delusion there is hope
[4:35:59] audy: "everybody" the minority KEKW
[4:36:00] AlienatedFL: It would be wild if Rockstar had some sort of RP built out already
[4:36:02] yaboiburaking: Prob not all consoles. Too much work. But for sure pc and ps5. The game is a massive kogwheel. The demands for a PC version of the game wasn't that big. It was weird to play San Andreas on PC. Everybody played on PS, hence why they prob hesitated.
[4:36:04] JeePecks: Yeah double dipping is smart to be fair
[4:36:05] HarryPatel: Run the trailer back just to get hype
[4:36:09] Jurgen___: thats not even wishful thinking thats just insane
[4:36:09] armedgolem01: chat u are all basing your logic on 10 yr old advertising lol
[4:36:11] AlienatedFL: It wont come out on PC dude lol
[4:36:13] Athasin: @HyperPerky Nah PC in 1 year. The 2 years for V was because of next gen consoles and there are no next gen consoles releasing in 2026
[4:36:13] audy: the majority are on console KEKW
[4:36:18] BDG_Toa676: Hmmm
[4:36:18] AlienatedFL: i promise cause the way games are dev'd
[4:36:19] mynameismikeyd: why would they do that? it makes them more money to release on console, wait a while, then release it on PC so people buy it twicce
[4:36:23] Panos_97: CHICKEN GLADIATOR
[4:36:28] Villenthessis: EZ Chicken Gladiator
[4:36:29] audy: marinating OMEGALUL
[4:36:29] KrazyAlpha_: i hope its crossplay cuz i wanna get it on pc but most my friends dont have one
[4:36:31] SharePeace: they will use money from consoles to port the pc version
[4:36:43] HarryPatel: you cant cook KEKW
[4:36:44] AlienatedFL: Ill bet any amount of money on the fact that it doesnt come out on PC for 1 year
[4:36:45] audy: a new revelation to this guy OMEGALUL
[4:36:49] M0hkofantti: Chicken gladiator!
[4:36:49] combattingjosh: trip to nicks EZ
[4:36:50] ooCORSAIRoo: probably

[4:41:15] mynameismikeyd: GTA6 will come out mid to late 2025, which means PC will come out around late 2026/early 2027, meaning earliest we'll see "SixM" will be mid to late 2027

[4:42:19] The_YellowMist: @alienatedfl if that’s the case I can’t wait to waste a few months on it
[4:42:24] Panos_97: @mynameismikeyd That is IF the game releases at a good state. Otherwise the PC release could be delayed
[4:42:28] CrazyTwist420: $$$$ pay up shiesty
[4:42:40] HyperPerky: @mynameismikeyd I really hope youre on the money there but they will farm the hell out of it

[4:43:25] Trixcross: you don't need this info at all
[4:43:27] Hudson_Pain: Welcome to business, they want you to buy a console, they don't make these games / consoles out of the kindness of their hearts

[4:44:18] R5F_: 5k is crazy yeah
[4:44:19] Athasin: @panos_97 Not really, console architecture has finally started replicating PC architecture so porting games now is easier. Hence why it took them a year to port RDR2
[4:44:22] Belial2k: 3.5k
[4:44:39] audy: yeah cops are rich PepeLaugh
[4:44:41] ramsin50: why are you paying for information you already have?

[4:45:17] AlienatedFL: PFT
[4:45:21] Panos_97: @Athasin We'll see. If GTA6 has RDR2's scope you can be sure there will be technical issues. But one can only hope that it launches properly
[4:45:23] Hudyn: Bro the crim Piggy Bank
[4:45:40] Trixcross: you're gonna need more than his recording as evidence so 3k is kinda wild
[4:45:42] Xellwrath: @HyperPerky I mean, they 100% will make it with the idea to be PC compatible and have easier time porting it later.
