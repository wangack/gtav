[0:33:29] Sniffle04: shouldnt you do this when u get a new house, not now? LULW
[0:33:32] 1iwill: i say right side only because its a few less steps from the door
[0:33:32] Dysotopia: rightside, cut the landing in half and put stairs back towards window going down a floor
[0:33:33] crazyiitopii: Could try right not that hard to move atm
[0:33:35] Villenthessis: mhm that's the right side to put it
[0:33:36] Hikamari: you being higher WONT help you see behind the angle anyway
[0:33:38] hangryzai: Left side. You can wall the right side
[0:33:43] np7092: That’s fine. Maybe add a railing?
[0:33:44] 1iwill: not really much other reason

[0:33:49] jesleaks: @Sniffle04 YEP that's what I thought
[0:33:51] Tenivir: Sniffle04 thats gonna be a bit and she wants to avoid a dead angle next to the door
[0:33:52] loekup: turn the stairs 90 degrees, and make a stair landing under the window
[0:33:52] Sir_Richardt: cant you go down with stairs from the big window maybe?
[0:33:54] Consensus_: continue the floor all the way to the window, then stairs down, towards kitchen.
[0:34:06] GlennTheWolf: Extend first floor to window then Stair down from the Extended ledge and another stair down
[0:34:06] blmeek: put stairs on right side so easier to come in door and walk down steps
[0:34:07] Yoi_97: extend half of that room
[0:34:13] joyoruz: cant u just put smt there so nobody can stand there
[0:34:14] nuhbinho: start them under window facing left

[0:35:26] LeBrozoJM: hey vee
[0:35:27] BubFrost: Yea it's just 1 blindsplot nbd
[0:35:27] Tenivir: i think that might just be a dead angle naturally if they are completely still
[0:35:42] x_amer__: this make it easier
[0:35:43] Tuga_cef: did the same again LULW
[0:35:45] RAVE_CS2: you could put a railing on the edge of that ledge to make it look better
[0:35:46] sh0rty: lol complains she keeps putting key away, and then does it again.. insanity @Acie
[0:35:48] relentless_: why im keeping the key in the barrel, whats wrong with me.. minute later, puts the key back to the barell KEKW

[0:38:38] Kangaroo_Balls: Stairs that start from window (with ledge) and you don't have to worry about doing double stairs, you can hvae single stairs
[0:38:48] InfamousHoole: yeah, move the landing to the left halfway
[0:38:49] KennC137: @Acie you can just a small stair from your door to elevate your 1st floor
[0:38:58] Cloud_Piercer_: Can you use the smaller floor sections to build the landing instead of the actual landing so that you can stagger the depth of the landing to give more headspace going down?
[0:38:58] StreamElements: Cloud_Piercer_, no
[0:38:59] InfamousHoole: so the next flight moves right
[0:39:06] koochiiee: @ekahs_ peepoSitBlubbers okay
[0:39:10] InfamousHoole: yep
[0:39:10] StreamElements: YEP COCK
[0:39:18] loekup: and then make the stairs L shaped instead of U shaped, that will safe space aswell
[0:39:20] BubFrost: YEP
[0:39:34] ekahS_: @koochiiee just use the default Spotify playlists, they are similar
[0:39:35] IraqiMamba: Hmm
[0:39:41] Dysotopia: like I stated cut landing in 2
[0:39:48] CorveIius: wawa
[0:39:50] InfamousHoole: he's saying the same thing we're saying
[0:39:58] koochiiee: !playlist
[0:39:58] StreamElements: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4AN0z5Oj8x5aRGNes3yTtv?si=3775fbabf6c34f69
[0:40:00] Dysotopia: first one is this size and other half set back further to give more head room
[0:40:10] duck_deficiency: OOOO we are getting upgrades
[0:40:30] dwomak: start a single stair from the big window down into the house maybe?
[0:40:32] Kangaroo_Balls: turn stairs another 90 degrees and then you can use single long stairs
[0:40:36] koochiiee: !playlist
[0:40:36] StreamElements: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4AN0z5Oj8x5aRGNes3yTtv?si=3775fbabf6c34f69
[0:40:50] SupportCarryy: cuh need a gun rack by the window for all the PD equipment
[0:40:53] RevillianGG: here we go Acie here we go woo woo here we go Acie here we go woo woo
[0:41:01] Crazyman114: Hey you're pretty good at this Brie
[0:41:06] Tenivir: KEKW true
[0:41:10] Kangaroo_Balls: Just have one long stairs starting at the big window going all the way down
[0:41:11] umudoffy: The pattern SAJ
[0:41:13] qihk: im wondering if the wood goes outside a certain perimeter of the house does it cause lag?
[0:41:13] HandofOdd: ocd yeah
[0:41:17] m331o: u need small ones
[0:41:20] LeBrozoJM: lol
[0:41:21] Liink93: LETHERCOOK
[0:41:25] relentless_: CHAAT, do you enjoy the sims streams?
[0:41:26] LeBrozoJM: time to burn it all down
[0:41:29] genn1_: The lack of material rotation is so annoying LUL
[0:41:35] andrefvm: With that 2 people won't be able to cross each other
[0:41:39] MonMunn: maybe use a different texture floor
[0:41:47] Tenivir: i dont think the pattern being the other way there is all that noticeable though
[0:41:47] itsfakee: nah not it
[0:41:48] WizzyAW: Time to move to Mirror park lol
[0:41:51] iHarsh29: try different staircase
[0:41:58] SupportCarryy: PepoG maybe u can put carpet on that section
[0:41:59] loekup: if you put down both stairs first, i think it will be eassier to visualize what the best setup is
[0:41:59] jesleaks: Is it worth going through all of these changes when you're likely buying a new house soon?
[0:42:03] xunique_girlx: Hi hi. Got no audio but remember everyone is amazing and I have been on your streams off and on. But now my phone decides to give me hard time. But hugss ro everyone!! <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 my days has been giving me hard sad times. Today I should get a new phone. Much love everyone!
[0:42:03] StreamElements: This is Acies channel, not a support page for other streamers
[0:42:07] iHarsh29: try the other staircases
[0:42:08] realJokoWidodo: Y
[0:42:12] Kangaroo_Balls: longstairs that go all the way down starting at teh window?
[0:42:13] pilhass10: are there different staircases?
[0:42:17] qihk: they have to first buy the mirror park house to start moving stuff
[0:42:21] HandofOdd: It does look extra
[0:42:21] scrouch144: hi
[0:42:40] andrefvm: The previous plan was better and if you use 2 small pieces of floor for the landing you can gain an extra step
[0:42:47] R3Mix7: how u be gamin allllll dy
[0:42:59] txjosh86: Father Acie 🫡
[0:43:05] Marcolomeus: yo
[0:43:11] andrefvm: Divide the landing in half
[0:43:18] irascible23: just place a window in the blind spot if thats possible
[0:43:21] Nickomongo: like cut in half and face it the other way maybe?
[0:43:26] pete__zza: if you sell a house does it keep the interior design like this or does it reset?
[0:43:36] genn1_: Like stairs going to landing, then one more landing lower for a step height, then another pair of stairs
[0:43:40] azh314: probably best not to listen too much to chat, you've spent more time in the catalogue than all of us combines
[0:43:44] andrefvm: Divide the landing in half and have a step in the middle
[0:43:45] TheOxKing682: @qihk I think they're gonna skip mirror park houses and just wait for Vinewood houses when they're available
[0:43:49] bigscott33: @pete__zza keeps it but u can take stuff out before u sell it
[0:43:57] RenOfficially: @pete__zza that has yet to be discovered
[0:44:18] hangryzai: Copy the z position
[0:44:20] six_slayz: you broke it
[0:44:24] scrouch144: ICANT
[0:44:33] BubFrost: Draw em in Paint and screenshot, architects in chat Kapp
[0:44:38] Hikamari: move stuff to backpack... the game is trying to put stuff inside pockets i think
[0:44:47] Alaineman: Scuffed pixel
[0:44:48] andrefvm: Divide the landing in half and have a step in the middle, one half lower than the other
[0:44:54] Cloud_Piercer_: If you turn the flooring pieces horizontal going down the stairs, and let them clip through the wall, you can do say three deep on the left and two on the right to gain head height for the second set of stairs.
[0:44:55] RenOfficially: @bigscott33 what the whole this stays or just the floor plans?
[0:45:15] pineapplegladiator: Hi chat! Is the house getting a makeover?
[0:45:19] Hikamari: move stuff to backpack... the game is trying to put stuff inside pockets i think 󠀀
[0:45:22] scrouch144: OMEGALUL
[0:45:25] Dysotopia: falling out of your pockets
[0:45:36] Yungb905: hey acey what ear buds do u use for stream?
[0:45:46] bigscott33: @RenOfficially i think everything would stay
[0:45:50] ekahS_: !earbuds @Yungb905
[0:45:50] StreamElements: HyperX Cloud Earbuds t.ly/Bu5o
[0:45:52] RenOfficially: girl got holes in her pockets
[0:45:54] Hikamari: oh your full full
[0:45:58] iHarsh29: put in large storage
[0:46:03] RenOfficially: @bigscott33 that’s crazy
[0:46:24] Yungb905: @ekahS_ ty bro
[0:46:34] RevillianGG: she’s so locked in rn
[0:46:37] bigscott33: @RenOfficially u can move stuff tho, u can pick everything up and move it to other houses
[0:46:50] qihk: LUL
[0:46:54] scrouch144: unlucky
[0:46:55] irascible23: KEKW
[0:47:01] Hikamari: they should just add scaling options would make everything much easier
[0:47:04] clevertent_: Can you do L shaped stairs?
[0:47:05] StreamElements: clevertent_, no
[0:47:07] Crowz7: further down
[0:47:11] HandofOdd: Decorating is a good morning brain stretcher
[0:47:13] FrOzInFeRnO: Hi Acie! Hello chat! I hope everyone had a great weekend.
[0:47:14] MISTERARTHER: Sims 5 gameplay Pog
[0:47:15] Crowz7: so you dont have to climb that bottom step
[0:47:23] andrefvm: With the extra step in the landing and with lower the bottom stairs, you may not need to move the floor
[0:47:25] Kangaroo_Balls: One long stairs that starts near the big window?
[0:47:25] Raivolver: does that even help?
[0:47:26] loekup: what about an L shape instead of a U shape ?
[0:47:28] FrOzInFeRnO: How are you doing today?
[0:47:29] Tenivir: mhm
[0:47:30] hangryzai: Lower the top stairs
[0:47:30] iHarsh29: just delete the whole house
[0:47:31] jesleaks: push both stairs and the middle section slightly further down
[0:47:31] LeBrozoJM: vee really be doin it all
[0:47:32] InfamousHoole: too bad there's no spiral staircase
[0:47:35] scrouch144: move the landing further back or the stairs a bit down
[0:47:36] Androzxd: make the first stairs longer and you get further down and away
[0:47:41] Cloud_Piercer_: If you turn the flooring pieces horizontal going down the stairs, and let them clip through the wall, you can do say three deep on the left and two on the right to gain head height for the second set of stairs.

[0:47:49] Moxxie92: Just move the first stair down a bit, move the landing down and you might have enough headroom
[0:47:51] 1iwill: can you not use the parallel stairs where the landing is now?
[0:47:51] StreamElements: 1iwill, no
[0:47:51] iHarsh29: how is this saving space
[0:47:51] InfamousHoole: actually, if she does an L she'll run into the wall
[0:47:54] InfamousHoole: FUFUFUFUFUFUFUFUFU
[0:47:58] dwomak: small landing before the top stair so you can move both closer to the big window
[0:48:01] LeBrozoJM: builder by day, criminal by night.
[0:48:10] Sir_Richardt: thats why the 90 degree turn might be better i think
[0:48:10] SupportCarryy: PepoG gotta take into account that you're taller with heels too
[0:48:10] andrefvm: Can also lower the landing more
[0:48:10] StreamElements: andrefvm, no

[0:48:37] Alex2theMoon: can you make the floor between the stairs narrower?

[0:48:37] keeesh: so close
[0:48:37] StreamElements: Alex2theMoon, no
[0:48:39] jesleaks: The top stair can be further down @Acie .
[0:48:49] andrefvm: You can lower everything

[0:48:52] StreamElements: Thomas_5970, no
[0:48:52] BubFrost: Any reason the middle landing zone is 2x1?
[0:48:53] qihk: make 1 half square
[0:48:53] Moxxie92: Move the landing down LUL
[0:48:57] Rockhound__97: That should work
[0:48:57] Thomas_5970: plank*
[0:49:01] qihk: instead of a big rectangle floor
[0:49:06] MunkkiMan: u can remove the floor from up there and make a small loop around it
[0:49:10] LeBrozoJM: lol
[0:49:14] MISTERARTHER: I hope this won't make you tear apart the whole house but floors with low ceilings are the worst and cause claustrophobia lookUp
[0:49:30] SupportCarryy: PepoG who engineered these levitating stairs
[0:49:35] imay_xo: u can make the landing   different heights
[0:49:37] InfamousHoole: oh 5head move, add a board to the main floor but only where the stairs are?
[0:49:42] ekahS_: elaDank
[0:49:51] Hikamari: are there "longer" stairs in the catalogue ? 󠀀
[0:50:03] iHarsh29: isn't this taking more space now
[0:50:04] nonnahshannon: I love that everyone is thinking so hard rn
[0:50:04] andrefvm: Lower the landing and the bottom staris
[0:50:07] Rockhound__97: get a landing part and just add it
[0:50:08] genn1_: Have two landings next to each other, one lower than the other that way bottom stairs will be lower by 1
[0:50:09] jesleaks: If you have the double stair at the top section, you'll have more space for the head @Acie
[0:50:14] ekahS_: @nonnahshannon I'm not
[0:50:16] PRE5TO_: there just gonna jump and hit their head anyway
[0:50:18] hangryzai: Lower the mid floor

[0:50:24] StreamElements: @ekahS_ @ekahS_ @ekahS_ hai
[0:50:28] AlexNattes: it is fine
[0:50:28] Tenivir: you could place some random decoration there to stand on

[0:50:53] qihk: or put another secret entrance
[0:51:01] genn1_: That works
[0:51:09] Rockhound__97: looks good, add storage under stairs?

[0:51:44] ekahS_: @nonnahshannon WOAH
[0:51:45] Bronko_v1c: you could move the stairs + landing towards the big window and close the top gap with a small floor
[0:51:45] Wesker889: sani stream? NOPERS sims stream? NODDERS
[0:51:46] SupportCarryy: what if you emote
[0:51:52] iHarsh29: this is waste of space anyways
[0:51:53] Tenivir: yeah its a bit of wasted space if you cant get under there but tricky to do any other way
[0:51:56] azh314: can you place barrels or something underneath?
[0:52:01] Iliketrainsbrahhhh: these stairs are triggering my ocd
[0:52:03] 미니마우수: house building is so cosy

[0:52:17] Bleubz: yep but u can add some box under for storage or something
[0:52:35] scrouch144: not straight Gayge
[0:52:36] jesleaks: You wont hit your head in that stair when there is a downwards stair below it @Acie
[0:52:40] BubFrost: L shape vs U shape can save some wasted space
[0:52:45] mileybozo: hello phatpussy gang members peepiWave

[0:53:11] Tenivir: yeah just elongate one step with a smaller piece
[0:53:14] Rockhound__97: add a floor part on top or bottom
[0:53:21] Junkee27: ah the best interior decorator has returned
[0:53:24] Yoi_97: are there ladders?

[1:08:59] TheOxKing682: Is wood the only type of flooring?
[1:09:02] Hikamari: what jesleaks said could work you could put the big ones into each other and move one of them 0.0001 lower so they would not appear buggy
[1:09:02] 1iwill: where did you say you wanted to move the kitchen?
[1:09:12] jesleaks: Then put it inside the other floor, you don't need to put it outside the wall @Acie
[1:09:13] ediblemaster: 14 hour sim stream LETS GO
[1:09:27] tripes2: if u push the extra large inside they dont go out

[3:25:57] Shivie78: He could have also taken her apart of the group and have a chat. Its not very nice to blast someone infront of a group
[3:25:57] IraqiMamba: wawa
[3:25:59] xShiryu23: @megasoy it was him leading. do you know how to lead ppl with hdmi? thats the only way for them to pay attention. pay attention how raia actaully listened and wasnt runing around or on the phone. lol

[3:27:34] Kenjack1984: this is the same plan that caused them to be behind in the fist place and to make money that isnt needed. seems like jason doesnt want to do g6 anymore so he is going to build back up the money on the girls backs

[3:27:43] Praskle: I didnt say that lmao, I was referring to the guy that was asking but wtv
[3:27:45] Fluffin04: I don't think he spoke up because they are doing what they enjoy instead of farming
[3:27:46] RealWicari: but he keeps complaining about not having enough bitcoin and money being useless, why sell then
[3:27:47] crookedparadigm: thats how team work work
[3:27:49] girlballor: honestly with his personality type he should just ket you do the talking. he has made everyone defensive
[3:27:50] simmeringteapot: forcing someone like Raia to do 10h of sani a day is too cruel
[3:27:56] Nickomongo: the thing is, all other successful groups have somebody who they listen unconditionally
[3:27:57] YoinkDoink: all the good stuff happens offlien
[3:27:59] IraqiMamba: @ekahS_ im guessing the tickets just went on sale?
[3:28:00] ALXD_: TBH if jason listened to vee early on about how important mats were civ gang would be in a better spot
[3:28:03] Tenivir: he is trying to make everyone play the mmo grind game his way, will just cause friction
[3:28:07] joyoruz: its hard to be a leader cus u listen the most but not everyone can listen
[3:28:15] megasoy: @Nickomongo yes and if you watch Kebun, he isn't a dickhead to people. om
[3:28:15] RaphaelCraZyFive: Your grind got you into the group. keep it up.
[3:28:17] Timeriot: Jason is lead though, if he says we are trying x, that is what it is unless he's outvoted

[3:28:59] FRAlex010: na raia is just 21 child and want to play and have fun but he wanna progress
[3:29:01] FRAlex010: i feel him
[3:29:02] SilliTFT: Raia feels like selling again like they did early on was a mistake (which Jason agreed to at least when selling own stuff) that's why she's iffy about it
[3:29:05] IraqiMamba: @ekahS_ LMAO, thats fine you can figure that out anyway

[3:30:12] RaphaelCraZyFive: let them disagree.
[3:30:13] megasoy: @Nickomongo they listen to him because they respect him. he actually divides out the heist money. he doesn't pocket it and buy a car that he sells 4 weeks later.
[3:30:13] MillaZenik: easier life if u rise above it
[3:30:14] nuhbinho: the problem this time is that raia was right, and Jason should have told her that this was a temporary thing to get the money up
[3:30:16] Gusyyy1: YEP 󠀀
[3:30:16] rudytc: So much work needs to be done if you want to do the big heist in the end

[3:31:03] belllis_: im bad with that myself

[3:31:12] Roro_____: him saying i dont even want to explain my thought process to you jsut do as i say, is wild tho LUL
[3:31:13] ekahS_: @IraqiMamba San Diego is kinda sketch though, be careful where you stay
[3:31:13] emrhys95: I get jayzawn's pov but he should have someone else talk for him LUL
[3:31:13] Alonort00: what is funny to me, the only person Jason ask for opinion on house things, is Raia! So he cares about her opinion
[3:31:13] adamm220: sure. but its not mutually exclusive, which is what ur also saying
[3:31:13] girlballor: @Chelms166 people can discuss the action that is neing an rp chatter
[3:31:16] RaphaelCraZyFive: not controlling the emotions but expressing it in a healthy way. my opinion.
[3:31:16] TallYoda08: That is...fair
[3:31:18] ellum: thats the first time youve called me josh
[3:31:20] ellum: LOL
[3:31:20] marcohiguera01: Raia is rite tho Jason is the only one talking to them
[3:31:23] crookedparadigm: yes
[3:31:24] krosswynd: His tone was very bad
[3:31:25] cristina217: yes, the older you get the more you realize you have to pick your battles and not react to everything negatively
[3:31:26] Timeriot: @jonty1998  money and possible unlocks to doors later
[3:31:28] Nickomongo: agreed
[3:31:28] HandofOdd: Expressing a little humility and understanding what's being told to you.
[3:31:29] BorealisLumina: I do not unterstand why he doesn't farm Sani rep if he hates G6 and hasn't done it in weeks
[3:31:29] PRE5TO_: the girls should be in orange jumpsuits LuL
[3:31:31] Bulletproof_santa: Why is Raia mad? What I missed?
[3:31:32] Capt4inJuli: 60k circus boards for 48 butc
[3:31:35] Setback1: also if hes wrong
[3:31:38] turbomaxima: In all reality it's a game and no one should take anything personal
[3:31:40] IraqiMamba: @ekahS_ did you prefer vegas over it
[3:31:40] PlayersTwitch: omg not again
[3:31:41] CorveIius: Jackass
[3:31:41] Heavens_Night: om
[3:31:42] AFFABLE__: If Raia snaps she can literally remove you all from the house, I doubt she would but its worth keeping in mind.
[3:31:43] h0lk1: He does business irl, he knows his shit tbh
[3:31:44] KasaneRS: KEKG
[3:31:44] NeverOr3: TheVoices

[3:31:46] crazyiitopii: We get ya but you have been gaslight by Jason so much it's starting to sink in LUL
[3:31:48] adamm220: people are listening , he just didnt want to explain it
[3:31:50] Azyraft: why would people listen to him when he says "i dont have to explain myself to you"
[3:31:50] ornatefrosty: nunu TheVoices
[3:31:51] N3mEe: make it stop
[3:31:52] PubliqueEnemy: nunu pls.
[3:31:53] Nickomongo: he thinks he’s given enough time I think
[3:31:53] Timeriot: @Bulletproof_santa Jason told the group the plan, Raia G-checked him and got put down
[3:31:57] LilGhosteeeeee: she just doesn't have the same mentality about the specific situation. we understand. i get offended by tones too.. i've had to learn it the hard way
[3:31:59] krosswynd: gpu and BUTC will help u increase production and progress with heist and not mir park house
[3:32:03] ekahS_: @IraqiMamba definitely, Vegas is a really fun city ... expensive as shit though
[3:32:05] MRAPL: what u need to understand? he never actualy leans out an actual logical plan
[3:32:06] m331o: company has dragon for sani lang has union u need to be this group's and recruit zombies @Acie
[3:32:06] Z3phs: hes been enduring it for 2 months... wasnt that bad. Raia, Eugene, they are always pushing back on everything is exhausting like he said
[3:32:08] natty111000: I think he's a pretty good leader, people just need to remember it's not a race
[3:32:08] IraqiMamba: WutFace nunu
[3:32:10] MillaZenik: i mean that tone wouldn't work for me, but i'm in charge of my own reactions
[3:32:13] RaphaelCraZyFive: i got no problem with jason's tone he was right
[3:32:14] umudoffy: He has a plan that he doesn't want to explain. Get mad to people trying to rationalize the plan without even knowing the plan.
[3:32:14] Chelms166: @RaphaelCraZyFive ya'll are going way to hard on the same thing every stream and it's distracting is all
[3:32:15] CHAIRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR: thats it im raging after everything thanks
[3:32:15] HandofOdd: Like yesterday LUL
[3:32:18] DarthBrianIX: raia and jason have been going in circles for weeks, you cant blame him for not wanting to deal with it
[3:32:19] girlballor: unfortunate for jason we have seen this with the way he treats his co host on sream so we are defensive of his
[3:32:19] raulc_80: 10 hrs a day grinding is om
[3:32:20] Bulletproof_santa: @Timeriot oh damn
[3:32:23] Zeynlol: look at him standing on top contributing to the house PepeLaugh
[3:32:24] joyoruz: and now raia is vee ulting
[3:32:24] PerriSick: om
[3:32:28] IraqiMamba: @ekahS_ yeah... everything is for me fucking canadian dollars man Sadge
[3:32:28] Syntai_dev: @Z3phs Most of the time he isnt communicating with them because he feels he doesnt have to
[3:32:28] Villenthessis: @Timeriot G-checked? I think she just explained another idea to him LULE
[3:32:29] Tresch: SAJ
[3:32:31] adamm220: i think ppl are just concnered it kills the vibes when its delivered like that
[3:32:33] marcohiguera01: People surprised the jack ass acting like a jack ass lol +1 for Jason lol
[3:32:40] Kenjack1984: people are listening to him but you guys already did this plan and you guys were behind and then ramped up production now your going back to the same plan but without g6 money coming in.
[3:32:40] Praskle: Nick constantly says hes not a nice guy, idk why everybodys suddenly supprised tbh
[3:32:41] crookedparadigm: @HandofOdd yea yesterday was bad LUL
[3:32:42] Tenivir: Z3phs yeah cuz they are not a gang with some CEO, or atleast not how they started. He just ignoring everyone these days
[3:32:45] ekahS_: @IraqiMamba bruh, Euros are not that much better
[3:32:47] PlayersTwitch: i dont wanna be rude but i literally get a headache IRL when nunu sings
[3:32:50] RaphaelCraZyFive: @Chelms166 ??
[3:32:52] LilGhosteeeeee: i'm deep in this self awareness mentality rn. but it is important to have fun in the game you're playing. Shruge
[3:32:53] Villenthessis: @Villenthessis because the other day he wants more buttcoin now it changed, he wants more money NOTED
[3:32:54] Timeriot: @Bulletproof_santa Yeah it was bad tone by Jason, but Raia was overstepping on the leader's choices
[3:32:56] Freppuchino: nunu yapping omE
[3:32:59] PlayersTwitch: LUL
[3:32:59] xShiryu23: he even told raia she didnt have to do sani. like i dont understand. hes not forcing her lol chat is just wild
[3:33:02] jinhzoo: what happened???
[3:33:03] johntehdonz: DIESOFCRINGE
[3:33:03] MillaZenik: yeah when it gets tense like that it feels awkward for us too
[3:33:04] loekup: it can also be super frustrating if you try and explain to the best of your ability as to why or how certain things can be done, and someone shoots it down by saying no without giving a well explained counter argument
[3:33:05] np7092: PopNemo PopNemo
[3:33:05] Gusyyy1: KEKW
[3:33:06] IraqiMamba: @ekahS_ shit really LOL
[3:33:07] BabyNeek: not even Jason Jackass
[3:33:08] ashleyferns: mhm

[3:33:33] NeverOr3: Dentge not even an ant
[3:33:35] krosswynd: Raia is talking to her stream
[3:33:35] h0lk1: Sometimes conflict is needed tbh
[3:33:36] Z3phs: @Syntai_dev its not that that he feels that he "doesnt have to", its that its just not productive what so ever to pull them in
[3:33:36] f_dot: god her 200% mic
[3:33:38] LilGhosteeeeee: i give nunu credit for trying
[3:33:39] Pizkhalif: I want sims again sadge

[3:33:49] CorveIius: Sure
[3:33:49] StreamElements: crookedparadigm, no
[3:33:52] Villenthessis: Sure
[3:33:54] chinnook: she's not making it better lol
[3:33:57] Rliy: Sure
[3:33:59] Timeriot: Raia silent treatment SAJ
[3:34:00] MNQx: PopNemo PopNemo
[3:34:06] MillaZenik: that's fair tbh
[3:34:08] crazyiitopii: I think Jason cares about his 300k bank first to be fair LUL
[3:34:13] Kenjack1984: @Timeriot if a leader cant explain his decisions hes a bad leader
[3:34:17] 2wicked001: nunu preaching to toxic chat
[3:34:17] Zeynlol: first time he started selling gpu´s instead of keeping them it was a bad idea same goes now
[3:34:18] fluxNikko: nunu "long live the patriarchy" lol
[3:34:18] Elgid2000: Wouldn't it be better to be 2 groups of 2
[3:34:22] rudytc: every gang is going thru these same conversations
[3:34:25] RaphaelCraZyFive: MLADY have a goodie.
[3:34:28] theace8869: Civ Sani Gang
[3:34:32] Z3phs: @Tenivir they are not a gang, they exist and are in the place they are because Jason organized everything and makes them function. and if you cant see that its insane. they all have a voice but at one point you need to realize who got you where you are
[3:34:37] megasoy: he sold his 130k car, so you can trust him now om
[3:34:38] PRE5TO_: one word anwsers raia Prayge
[3:34:39] Azyraft: nunu is killing me NotLikeThis
[3:34:39] jaswho2: his group equals his bank account lol
[3:34:40] TallYoda08: @Acie Ok what is the actual end goal for the gang with all of this
[3:34:41] hourtempo: i do understand raia tho why sell CBs at all when clay jason and alex can do g6 for money... and he gave 50 bcoins but got nothing at all.. wow some info about vest
[3:34:42] anxiousPlatypus1: @Acie Riding the back of the Sani truck without proper work wear, what happened to you
[3:34:45] WizzyAW: awkward
[3:34:47] BupeHappy: @Kenjack1984 Fr what type of logic is don't ask me to explain
[3:34:47] cristina217: I understand jason but I do feel for raia, she gives off younger sibling energy SAJ
[3:34:48] ag_ko: raia needs a hug now
[3:34:48] f_dot: so now 8 hours of sani and the house is staying a mess?
[3:34:54] crazyiitopii: Don't get it twisted its not an EZ to lead civ gang LUL
[3:34:54] Fluffin04: I'm in physical pain, don't let nunu do pep talks om
[3:34:58] kayleee13: nunu always bring the good vibes
[3:34:58] napkin4872: jason just needs to gift raia 100 subs and everything will be ok
[3:35:00] MRAPL: but he can still be called out if he says something stupid...
[3:35:02] BoJackJohnsson: I dont understand. Jason want the group to make money... Yet he sits in a truck and provides nothing. Why dont he go and do G6
[3:35:04] jonty1998: g6 is pointless
[3:35:10] crookedparadigm: nunu already into deep om
[3:35:10] Praskle: @napkin4872 I vote for this
[3:35:13] BludScape: ladydimaDance kenya grace is bae
[3:35:17] mr_nitrouzz: @napkin4872 true
[3:35:18] undertothescore: Raia literally agrees to everything Jason says she rather having it explained so she knows what shes working for Jason can't just always just be like "trust me"
[3:35:20] MillaZenik: chat let's not get aggy with each other tho, this is after all a game
[3:35:21] Zeynlol: no shit om
[3:35:25] nonnahshannon: nezActually
[3:35:29] FRAlex010: La Civiliani Familia i heard this one in your discord today

[3:35:35] LeakDaTV: They complain about jason like he aint make the gang LUL
[3:35:37] azh314: At least do the t3 runs
[3:35:37] hourtempo: @BoJackJohnsson that's what im saying he got some info on vest he cant use
[3:35:41] theace8869: Vee turned Civ Gang into the Trash Gang KEKW
[3:35:42] DesignII: Bro reading chat
[3:35:42] NeverOr3: @Acie how much to punch Jason?
[3:35:43] jonty1998: why doesnt he quit g6
[3:35:47] jaswho2: yep go sit in a truck instead of selling cbs and fucking with the house coin production
[3:35:48] Phasehero: I think someone needs to take Raia aside and tell her her feelings are valid
[3:35:55] Tenivir: LeakDaTV you give him too much credit dude, all of them helped make it
[3:35:59] Zeynlol: wasting weeks at hoping for g6 om
[3:35:59] x_amer__: if mr black is here instead jason can go to g6
[3:35:59] enrocko_: Bro has been holding on to that G6 hope for months now
[3:36:05] FRAlex010: @jonty1998 because of the max rep g6
[3:36:10] jonty1998: but alex and clay still work at g6
[3:36:15] DesignII: @enrocko_ it'll eventually be here
[3:36:25] MillaZenik: @Phasehero i agree, just show understanding for her feelings at the very least
[3:36:32] MRAPL: i think its not just Raias feelings, her toughtprocess is actualy valid 2
[3:36:36] BubFrost: @jonty1998 he's hoping g6 will get some crazy content unlock
[3:36:39] Nickomongo: there’s a reason why g6 is off limits to crims.. Jason holding on to that
[3:36:42] RenOfficially: just remember not to check it a bunch too
[3:36:46] emrhys95: Jayzawn can probably get to 50 rep in sani in 3 days
[3:36:46] SteeG: If he still does a few G6 runs per day, then he can afford sani every so often. He doesnt have to be 300 24/7 I guess.
[3:36:48] nykter1: What's your rep at sani?
[3:37:05] jaswho2: @mrapl she’s right but her counter arguments get shut down
[3:37:11] jonty1998: wht content g6 about getting robbed
[3:37:13] enrocko_: Yeah
[3:37:20] Crazyman114: My shiny teeth that SPARKLEEE
[3:37:20] undertothescore: @Phasehero For real she giving her opinion but Jason getting passive agressive then whats the point of any discussion
[3:37:23] megasoy: Dean's waiting til March for the new academy they're making him go through
[3:37:33] Crazyman114: AAdd beauty to my FAAACE
[3:37:46] Nickomongo: @megasoy and all the internal craziness happening rn
[3:37:48] BubFrost: He can get back into the force at some point I think, just has to rp it out
[3:37:51] Kenjack1984: i havnt seen him on shiesty in a while he will be back on next month when he goes to academy
[3:37:51] Phasehero: @millazenik right? If not she going to internalize it and stew.
[3:37:52] fluxNikko: Nick losing his cool bc M left him and he's seeing he's not the leader he had in his head (losing his grip on the girrls)
[3:37:54] BorealisLumina: Raia so silent SAJ
