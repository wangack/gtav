[3:39:39] PsychoJoker: Fleein the scene fleein the scene YEP

[3:40:35] CrystalDimension: @SylvarantHP Cornwood's character is a NPC from Singleplayer base game. It is not a custom 5m character and this causes some bugs
[3:40:42] bluej255: tawk
[3:40:43] OutKast2: !size
[3:40:44] RetPaladinBot: After getting these numbers we find find the average flaccid penis size ( 3.61 ) and divide the average erect penis size (5.16) and do the following: 5.16/3.61 to get the soft to erect ratio. 5.16/3.61=1.42 inches erect for every inch soft. So we take esfands soft/slight chub size of 5.71 and multiply it by 1.42 to find his erect size. 5.71*1.42= 8.1

[4:44:40] xGameShock: @Clodhoppr Why? K isnt a criminal yet why cant he be there

[10:20:55] SkyeReaper: @SkyeReaper agreed, or the moment they decide on a raid, they send cops to stake out the place until they can lock it up; and then they know it isnt touched or cleaned

[12:09:18] Kelborn: @yinzer_houdini I dont think you know how the law works, being charged is simply being accused of a crime by the people of the state, because of the details you just stated, he could be acquitted, due to PD not being detailed about it. My point is, he knowingly purchased the gun and had it on him, he accepted the risk of being charged when he did that, regardless of how flimsy the circumstances are.

[12:10:59] TheB_dunks: It's an ooc server discussion. It's a new city and escalation occurred in a way that was unbalanced towards a particular party. The scales tipped at a time when pd is not on a good foundation yet (headcount, training and structure). Bias was pushed in the process and future rp was killed as a result. Issue is that it's now an ooc thing to correct imo
[12:10:59] fellathedude: YO LET IT GO YOU CANT PICK IT UP

[12:24:55] wonderboy543: HOLY COPIUM
[12:24:55] JakeStratic: @JakeStratic Secure scene when confused. How can you be mad the scene was secured. You can't chase 1 PD officer can't chase potentially armed suspects in 3 directions.
[12:24:57] mcfaceex: YEs Sadge
[12:24:57] lzrdwzrdtv: lookDown peeTime lookDown peeTime

[12:25:00] 4_Sak3n: murphy took a flight
[12:25:02] taraannee: idk what the solution is, crims wreaking havoc on civs so civs mad at pd, but pd tries to actually do police work & crims get mad at pd sooo

[12:25:06] braydentz: Yeah he took a flight out
[12:25:06] ShyMuffin: it‚Äôs hard because crim have so much more tools at the moment and police being super limited it leads to people being pressed and making mistakes. people don‚Äôt realize what the police officers are doing in NP and think that it‚Äôs all abuse. at the same time I understand being a crim and would probably be one if I was to play GTA rp
[12:25:07] Grickshaft: id do some digging and look through Ruths work
[12:25:08] TheGhostlyOnyx: he took the first flight out

[12:25:36] witness2nv: @Tubbins28 Isnt it the PD job to play the hard role of be the good guys even tho others are breaking the rules. Even if it means taking L's time to time in order to keep the peace?

[12:25:48] McNuggetyo: Not if done right lmao
[12:25:48] puppietreats: actually whack if X genuinely framed murphy and got him fucked over, very low
[12:25:49] lawlkat: @mcfaceex I said this would happen when xqc did this. his m3ta gaming to get Ws has real negative impacts on small streamers. same thing will happen to ruth

[12:26:40] ip33fr331y: whaaaatt. cornwood has been around as long as dirt!!
[12:26:40] vitilink: @ad3l0 he is not gonna share anything new, Its RP and its not to be taken personally
[12:26:40] desh_2x: so many limited ways to make money. everyone is getting bored and those trying to find extra areas of income getting shut down. What is the point, killing season.
[12:26:43] brimstonegusher: HDMI
[12:26:43] Waterbottels: @PlagueDoctorp K was cooking on the Dundee case, so they trumped up charges and put him on 24 hour hold is the TLDR
[12:26:45] permacool: i drank 10 redbulls help\
[12:26:46] satanicstrike: UGH

[12:26:58] mcfaceex: @Kelborn its not, they need to fix the issue that he proved exists
[12:27:03] Switchblade142: @Waterbottels The warrant was written before, wasnt randomly trumped up.
[12:27:08] cadbeaver01: imagine if they threw sheriff eli on this server, holy shit people think ruth is a hard ass. Their brains would blow up interacting with him LMAOOOOOOOOOO

[12:27:32] danny_yel: best case scenario is powerful pd tools with an innocent until proven guilty mindset. need really fair cops tho
[12:27:33] ZachFromChat: Mr k's opinion isn't to be taken lightly in character tbh
[12:27:34] theredfrosts: @lawlkat Exactly! It‚Äôs the grind that really ruins RP. It‚Äôs not about getting W‚Äôs every time.
[12:27:35] itsrambo: dark days ahead
[12:27:36] Switchblade142: @Waterbottels Literally go look earlier in the vod when they were talking about it lol
[12:27:36] dibadibb: @doinx they're just engaging in the RP story man, no need to get offended
[12:27:37] dh20: in all fairness, how Kebun got angry wasnt cool but the way PD handled everything there was awful, it removes the fun from the rp and the server
[12:27:38] Nionamot: A Sheriff is needed
[12:27:39] GYNECHIATRIST: @p_herbo24 wonder why pepeLaugh
[12:27:41] dapyman: The oversight committee is gonna make things even worse
[12:27:43] Waterbottels: @Switchblade142 no proof?
[12:27:43] VBW410: same 3.0 pd leadership expecting different results is crazy. love saab but new faces and people
[12:27:43] blahder: Cornwood needs some optimism lol
[12:27:44] puppietreats: @ad3l0 no they aren‚Äôt beefing at all it‚Äôs just all of them are frustrated with a lot of things
[12:27:44] Switchblade142: @Waterbottels Thats why the judge was there
[12:27:44] Firehead94: @chat jfc Ruth is a character in the PD, she's playing the straight laced capt, slacks is playing a little fast and loose and turner the straight man.

[12:28:09] ShyMuffin: @chodemilly they have better cars, they have the advantage of having very little precedents in court which lead to many charges being dropped despite being caught red handed, police don‚Äôt have most of the tool they could have, like they just recently had DNA swabbing brought to the game. crim have no rules to restrict them and often time people seem to do a lot of power gaming or bad rp too

[13:32:34] triiplen: doesn‚Äôt dna only work if they drop it on the ground?
[13:32:34] illuminat4242: except you
[13:32:35] Luthercorpz: For cops it's prob iffy for Judges it's fair game
[13:32:35] CrypticRiisk: if caught off duty and planted then in trouble i guess
[13:32:35] lgnashevich: DNA cannot pickup many things
[13:32:36] SpikerzX: You have dna scanners but only 1 person to link something to, its useless
[13:32:36] visualque: its going to change
[13:32:37] imSteffin: I think theres a misunderstanding about the DNA scanner somewhere. Either you or them aren't understanding it fully or something.
[13:32:37] Ancor_: you literally tested that hand to hand doesnt give dna
[13:32:39] Kolbreezy: @Kolbreezy exactly
[13:32:40] Graudenzo: DNA doesnt prove someone else planted it, just that someone else had it
[13:32:40] Khaosshinobi: because everyone else knows a dna scanner alone isn't enough it could be planted
[13:32:41] DazedenConfused: of fuck
[13:32:41] Prodigy46: I pledge allegiance to the Texas America
[13:32:42] kablard: GIMME FACE TRACKER
[13:32:43] shotsfired911: every judge is very vulnerable for sure
[13:32:43] BurgGolf: nothing would have changed with DNA for this. he was forced to hold gun and shoot
[13:32:43] kalsvares: cause your not the brightest :)
[13:32:43] TXCVulture: Susge
[13:32:44] APE_KlNG: Cuz someone can make them do it
[13:32:45] Sir_Tootsie: Susge
[13:32:45] ZilzGaming: DNA sometimes waks out
[13:32:46] Candor_Circus: Susge
[13:32:46] shadow__rain: maybe bc Cornwood is never off duty
[13:32:46] itsalviiin: Susge
[13:32:47] BlurredLife: DNA wouldnt work on like drugs and stuff like that yeah? lots of illegal stuff you could plant on a cop
[13:32:50] BurgGolf: his DNA was on the gun.
[13:32:50] Orbilion: Susge
[13:32:51] squirtlehermit: Susge yeah why
[13:32:51] ZachFromChat: I think you're the only one who's tested the scanner that much
[13:32:52] PLK_: Susge
[13:32:52] genesissukehiro: becouse its not proof he did not have/use and well theres no jury so no one to convince lol
[13:32:52] kennypowersyall: the repeating parts of sentences .... SCHIZO
[13:32:52] Hitmehn_: me/ wears gloves
[13:32:53] SimpForBB8: Susge yeah Archer
[13:32:54] k1nneDECIR: SeemsGood
[13:32:54] DazedenConfused: my sub ran out frig
[13:32:55] LogicWeasel: o7 Dapped
[13:32:56] Squallywrath: what's the deal with the guy who keeps repeating?
[13:32:56] DismalShark: Susge
[13:32:56] Sir_Tootsie: Susge Archer
[13:32:59] bg7ve: stare
[13:32:59] jdotno: he basically just left the server over it
[13:32:59] Moregorilla: Cornwood died from exhaustion.. carrying the pd his hard work
[13:33:02] froogo0: Cause Cornwood's gun is part of him. America It'd be criminally felonious for Cornwood to not have a gun LUL
[13:33:03] spencerpot: DNA scanner shows the last person to hold it, If they planet it and make them use it then their dna will be on the gun @EsfandTV
[13:33:06] UnfluffyBunny: It is still based off who is holding it at the time
[13:33:07] NonToxicant: DAPPED
[13:33:08] imSteffin: you look like an old man falling and reaching for his life alert
[13:33:09] Netric_X: Because they can make you hold the weapon and fire it, then down you and call 911?
[13:33:09] CodeForTea: lets be honest, will a downed cop ever get searched and will the searching cop snitch?
[13:33:11] Alpz_TV: because they ruled that he was guilty for just being in possession of of it. dna proves nothing but it has been touched by someone else
[13:33:12] Spliphos1199: @Squallywrath hes jimmmy 2 times its part of his character
[13:33:15] shotsfired911: he got shot in the head

[13:33:18] chivvyy: because he got shot in the head
[13:33:19] DiscretionaI: hit ‚Äòem with a quick zzz veiSleep

[13:33:19] CrypticRiisk: @jdotno he only came back because he wanted to be a judge i thought?
[13:33:20] NasrulAshr: Yeah
[13:33:21] TheGhostlyOnyx: it would be fail rp to say what happen though
[13:33:21] puppietreats: in his case, someone made him shoot the gun at knifepoint so the gsr would be on him and fingerprints
[13:33:22] lgnashevich: shot in the head yeah
[13:33:23] Khaosshinobi: he chose to have that story
[13:33:23] TheCrito: Unconscious cornwood the best cornwood

[13:33:30] NasrulAshr: He choose the story nodd
[13:33:30] CrypticRiisk: he let the rp play out maybe?
[13:33:31] loot_lord_jr: he had too
[13:33:33] playswitsquirrel: yeah he didn't even ocean dump
[13:33:33] KappaManJason: he didnt actually leave the server i don‚Äôt think
[13:33:35] ChainOfLightning: he got shot in the head
[13:33:35] GarlicMikeHawk: why are ads so damn loud
[13:33:35] SimpOnMyShrimp: He didnt leave LULE
[13:33:37] TheGhostlyOnyx: @EsfandTV he got shot in the head OMEGALUL
[13:33:37] allyparser: @jdotno WHO
[13:33:39] Spliphos1199: @Squallywrath np <3 enjoy the rp
[13:33:39] Lite_Ice: he wasnt ocean dumped
[13:33:40] Najb0lji: No DNA on Benji's gun from last night
[13:33:40] Wetidiot: he got shot in the head LUL
[13:33:41] itisacar: yall trippin he didn't leave the server
[13:33:42] Thomefan251: he could of easily remembered lol
[13:33:42] spencerpot: DNA scanner shows the last person to hold it, If they planet it and make them use it then their dna will be on the gun @EsfandTV
[13:33:43] Brakon: he was not ocean dump
[13:33:43] dlowhite: @KappaManJason he did
[13:33:45] taraannee: arent u supposed to?? or did he never get downed?
[13:33:47] uooba: you can survive a headshot
[13:33:47] ZachFromChat: He was shot in the head.  He cannot remember events for 1hr prior. Its in the rules i think
[13:33:51] genesissukehiro: DNA does not Equal Proof he did not do anything wrong
[13:33:52] illuminat4242: @Squallywrath that is his personallity for that character.  He is Jimmy "two times"
[13:33:53] NasrulAshr: Yeah he can remember
[13:33:53] TeejayOCE: Shot in the head =/= forget memory
[13:33:53] Squallywrath: @Spliphos1199 I will, today has been NUTS.
[13:33:54] Spliphos1199: 18 KEKW
[13:33:59] EvoMikee: he was drunk
[13:34:02] Phugyu2: who we talking about here?
[13:34:05] Wetidiot: he chose not to remember which would make sense for a head wound anyway
[13:34:05] uooba: a headshot isnt a 100% a death sentence
[13:34:06] Lite_Ice: he was not ocean dumped and decided to not remember he screwed himself
[13:34:06] k1nneDECIR: SeemsGood
[13:34:07] icken321: oo another mis step on the pd
[13:34:07] ZachFromChat: I think theres a misunderstanding that you are literally not allowed to remember
[13:34:08] RobialT: He chhose not to remember
[13:34:09] chivvyy: i mean he rped in the most honest way to go along with the scenario
[13:34:09] ToxiccLadd: he just made the choice to rp out the brain damage
[13:34:10] skool_: I think he was trying to make it as comparable as a random person. Like if a civilian got a gun planted on them and there was no kidnapping call they would 100% be charged for it
[13:34:10] ImDeepPocketz: I think not remembering is the honorable thing to do
[13:34:13] ciphz: its an rp choice.
[13:34:13] LogicWeasel: omg, there's a pic of you on the project on slacks' stream @EsfandTV  LULW
[13:34:16] Kolbreezy: @Phugyu2 murphy
[13:34:19] Luthercorpz: Literally no judge, no lawyer, no one though he'd be found guilty LUL An then it hapened
[13:34:20] Xen_Crypt: wasnt there some scuff involved?
[13:34:21] spencerpot: DNA scanner shows the last person to hold it, If they planet it and make them use it then their dna will be on the gun @EsfandTV
[13:34:23] dlowhite: memory loss can be RPd with a head wound doesnt have to just be ocean dumped
[13:34:24] smpies: Susge archer say no bias but defending criminal
[13:34:24] advancedwolverine: its good fith
[13:34:25] KappaManJason: @dlowhite hes on server right now
[13:34:26] icken321: not raiding for a pd gear but raiding k for pd gear
[13:34:26] Dricera: @ImDeepPocketz honorable towards who
[13:34:27] miketwng: judge murphy is still guilty
[13:34:27] Chaoszero_goc: he was doing good rp and it didnt work out
[13:34:27] KappaManJason: he didnt
[13:34:29] playswitsquirrel: yeah i think he was too cocky tbh, he needed to remember a bit more than he did
[13:34:34] Ajaximus: people are also free to RP whatever injuries they want
[13:34:38] Spliphos1199: @Squallywrath its STUPIDLY easy to get caught up in it. I see myself watching it in the background at work. Love hearing about a world that is just like ours with its own twists
[13:34:40] squirtlehermit: LULW the projector is gold rn

[13:34:45] evilmoose__: The whole RP of that was kind of fumbled.
[13:34:45] froogo0: Susge Archer arguing for the guilty?!
[13:34:50] TheGhostlyOnyx: @elrood1013 o7 rip like 99% of the server
[13:34:52] dudemanbroo: knowing what happened the investigation was done poorly
[13:34:58] Alpz_TV: this is so stupid
[13:34:59] Aledz_: ocean dumps never work esfandTV
[13:34:59] k1nneDECIR: Duncan
[13:35:01] TXCVulture: Duncan
[13:35:03] DiscretionaI: Forgetting after being shot in the head = +1 Hardcore RP
[13:35:08] AlbyNz: Its gonna be an interesting law going forward
[13:35:10] LastWeekNextDay: @EsfandTV have you checked projector

[13:35:13] puppietreats: W maple EZ
[13:35:15] SoulYou_: @EsfandTV even oliver, the prosecutor said that he will loose this case. It was a weird ruling and it will be appealed
[13:35:15] RexPappa: Do some pain sounds at random
[13:35:15] romoleus: Is a Captain leading the meeting?
[13:35:17] genesissukehiro: dought does not matter if you dont have a jury lol
[13:35:20] playswitsquirrel: he just said it's obvious it was a setup jesus
[13:35:20] spencerpot: I think more judges will get guns planted on them soon because of this
[13:35:24] TheGhostlyOnyx: PepeLaugh  TeaTime
[13:35:27] Squallywrath: @Spliphos1199 I think I've been watching rpers for almost 12 hours at this point, jumping between different streamers who are 'on-scene', for diff perspectives etc. No metagaming though, obviously :P
[13:35:31] playswitsquirrel: wat a g
[13:35:32] dlowhite: @KappaManJason Murphy the character, not the streamer just to clarify
[13:35:32] lgnashevich: PepeLaugh
[13:35:32] Cintr40: Susge KIT PLANT THE GUN ON HIM
[13:35:33] gateloz: I feel like people are just gonna murphy their least favorite cop and get them fired by planting that gun
[13:35:34] jdotno: malicious prosecution if they knew it was a setup and still proceeded
[13:35:39] imSteffin: https://i.imgur.com/hznzzu3.png lol

[13:36:34] 3xevilx: ??? they did
[13:36:34] Luthercorpz: They had month for the case ..lol
[13:36:35] froogo0: Susge Archer did amazing on the trial and got a guilty verdict out of the person. Thereby making a criminal.
[13:36:37] RukMus: they did
[13:36:37] b3asy6: it was thrown out the med report, wouldn‚Äôt let me use it
[13:36:39] RukMus: but ok

[13:36:59] NonToxicant: LUL

[13:37:14] BjRumplee: Defence didn't throw. There was just a lot of chaos immediately prior and he didn't prep so I think he winged it for the most part
[13:37:15] Agnt_smith: PD right now : We did this but let's think hard how it's not our fault
[13:37:15] superboy719: @superboy719 proving a point

[13:37:25] Zev______: Do either Archer/Mcnulty stream?
[13:37:26] gateloz: it sets a precedent that cops can't go off duty otherwise they risk losing their character
[13:37:28] Kelborn: sparknotes? What is this 2004?
[13:37:28] loot_lord_jr: no way the pd thinks he shouldnt have been charged and still doing it
[13:37:33] TheCrito: Unconscious cornwood is bis
[13:37:34] AlbyNz: Judge probably following law as its written
[13:37:36] OphidianFX: ramen fail

[13:38:01] skool_: Yea
[13:38:01] LogicWeasel: Fumbled the bag
[13:38:06] puppietreats: @superboy719 i think everyone knows that ooc lol
[13:38:06] Lord_Ribbit: A lot of the stuff they are talking about but ramme and them were not allowed to talk about that stuff because own had that evidence thrown out
[13:38:08] superboy719: yesss
[13:38:08] bobbybedstains: LuL

[13:38:38] SoulYou_: @Diamondman121314 but the judges that were present and the head of the bar didnt agree with the ruling tho
[13:38:40] Neekapkilla: Murphy wanted to be guilty or he wouldn't have RPed the drunk thing
[13:38:42] jdotno: I think he won‚Äôt be the last judge to be kidnapped
[13:38:43] ZilzGaming: @D00Dlles JP(but no one knows that)
[13:38:45] superboy719: @puppietreats they do. he is the only one verbalizing it, since the parking lot in the hoospital

[13:38:50] playswitsquirrel: tbh defense definitely needed to provide an alternate scenario, i.e. the person who planted the gun
[13:38:55] spencerpot: but what happens when more judges get caught with pd guns on them? @EsfandTV
[13:38:59] D00Dlles: NODDERS

[13:39:03] Diamondman121314: @Diamondman121314 yeah because they didn't get to look at the evidence in full like the ruling judge got to
[13:39:04] KingCarter: just kidnap someone and plant a gun on them to ruin their life üëç

[13:39:15] evilmoose__: Ramee was too focused on trolling Hall the whole time.
[13:39:15] ben_v_art: So this is a meeting about the PD charging and getting someone convicted they think was innocent? LoL
[13:39:16] spencerpot: The Dna Scanner isnt as good as you think @EsfandTV

[13:39:21] genesissukehiro: nope
[13:39:22] Smoogol: kidnap + force to fire a gun + knock you out = guilty @EsfandTV
[13:39:22] Khaosshinobi: murphy was known for being a character that would drive every job/career his character had into the ground and ruin every relationship he had so i'm not shocked about the RP
[13:39:24] ukjaybee: did K‚Äôs other houses get searched? I fell asleep after the PD HouseüòÅ

[13:39:28] Thurstay: nah
[13:39:28] ciphz: sort of. the laws in 3.0 dont exist in 4.0 rn
[13:39:29] Lord_Ribbit: There was a lot of evidence was thrown out and not usable
[13:39:29] bjxnn: dna is accurate?
[13:39:31] TXCVulture: yeah it must be for rp cause the defence fucked it hard
[13:39:32] Ancor_: it only picks up DNA on thrown items
[13:39:33] Agony099: @ukjaybee yep
[13:39:34] wimdey: why is the pd not taking the dub on this one? @esfandtv
[13:39:34] Fyerie: because now the precedent is set that you can force someone to shoot a gun then plant it on the,
[13:39:35] megaeverything12: no, there is no way to challenge a planted gun now
[13:39:35] UnfluffyBunny: The dna on the gun doesnt matter. It is who has the gun at the time of the incident
[13:39:36] Najb0lji: @EsfandTV  Benji's DNA wasn't on the gun last night
[13:39:36] lgnashevich: DNA is not accurate
[13:39:37] ultimategamersan: try to find out with slacks I am also confused LUL

[13:39:39] BjRumplee: Ramme took the L but the team took the W. It brought them together even more
[13:39:40] riotscream: @EsfandTV  did you see the sod p2 pally runes?
[13:39:40] Blackwell0102: he was found guilty they should not be implying it was planted at all no?
[13:39:41] ZachFromChat: @EsfandTV  "guilty beyond a REASONABLE DOUBT" there was reasonable doubt is what i think they're talking about... only in character as cops. thats the scary thought
[13:39:43] Diamondman121314: @proxgs_ judge did not throw. just because you don't agree doesn't mean he threw. he explained the reasoning, even on his own stream
[13:39:43] JazzPimp: It sets a bad precedent
[13:39:44] streptomyces: you're assuming the DNA will work, but it still has set a precedent that planted evidence means guilty until proven innocent
[13:39:44] PsycloneTM: @esfandtv why didnt they just use the dna scanner then?
[13:39:44] Agnt_smith: AMEN
[13:39:44] Kazzap: ramee and k knew who did as jp asked them to help with it beforehand but declinded
[13:39:45] iantenna: @taraannee JP wanted Murphy to win, so he could appeal his case and get back is 30k fine
[13:39:48] puppietreats: @superboy719 oh yeah, in character he‚Äôs the only one with ‚Äúevidence‚Äù to be suspicious about it.
[13:39:48] Squallywrath: OOC: Probably some kind of pregame for the Mr K shit that's about to happen?
[13:39:50] Wandering_Ranger: of they give you the gun directly, theres no dna
[13:39:52] AlbyNz: Judge said that his decision is based on how the law is written
[13:39:52] hosseinfel: @Crosstak good point
[13:39:53] SoulYou_: @proxgs_ yup, defense should have fought harder on the right arguments. It was a good case tho
[13:39:53] Lord_Legolas: DNA scanners should scare them off about planting stuff, just bcs it exists, even if it doesn't work for a 100%
[13:40:00] DiscretionaI: *Snores* ‚Äúlousy‚Ä¶ police work‚Äù says while RP sleeping haha
[13:40:00] Mouso9: Pd releases new evidence and drops charge?
[13:40:02] spencerpot: DNA SCANNER DOESNT DO SHIT
[13:40:02] wildarrow88: They are legitimately afraid
[13:40:02] Thorgear: DNA only shows up on items if they are placed or thrown on the ground
[13:40:02] PsycloneTM: Thats lame
[13:40:05] ElizabethAtDawn: it‚Äôs a real concern imo
[13:40:05] daltarr: what cop gonna search another cop off duty tho
[13:40:07] genesissukehiro: DNA will not help becouse its not PROOF and reasonable dought does not matter with no jury hes fuked
[13:40:08] judge_hat: even if they had dna scanner those guns did not have serial numbers
[13:40:09] miketwng: chet this case was a month old

[14:13:57] EmDuBB13: he seems anti comedy
[14:13:58] puppietreats: @dannorexx yeah a lot of the people playing this game are literally RP streamers
[14:13:58] DrWetbone: punishment is never a good way to deal with wrongdoing
[14:14:08] HavocusRex: it‚Äôd be better without the aoe daps, getting 4 at a time  is stupid
[14:14:11] Dricera: Then shouldnt that kind of review happen at every DAP?
[14:14:12] ViciousRumor: I'm going by what I've heard from Esfand on stream, he has said multiple times that civilian weapons licenses were $50k
[14:14:27] Janman88: @Trystah he was only trying to raise morale for g6 - wich police failed at LUL
[14:14:28] GlitchyGunZ: lot of the people are robots lol no people skills or life experience. mass punishment is not proven to help. It should be case by case basis. @esfandtv
[14:14:29] xxlonegunmanxx: They dont think like that. Captians will say "you didn't listen to me 10 times, you are not improving you are fired.
[14:14:30] Thozel: Esfand will soon fall from the chair LUL
[14:14:31] Wallsh_: @ViciousRumor hunting license??
[14:14:36] puppietreats: idk if it‚Äôs off the table but didn‚Äôt they say he could do academy again?
[14:14:37] dannorexx: @puppietreats the cops specifically. it is a choice to be one
[14:14:38] evilmoose__: @viciousrumor He said 500k
[14:14:38] GILx87: A DAP system is as important as an Employee of the Month system. Gotta reward good behavior too

[14:14:49] TheSlike123: @drwetbone true but some never learn if not punished and thats why you got prison
[14:14:49] OphidianFX: daps should happen when your warned the first time and do something again after a warnung
[14:14:50] ViciousRumor: @Wallsh_ no, this was before hunting rifles were even on the server
[14:14:51] ZachFromChat: okay then wheres denzel
[14:14:53] povdino: xqcTOS xqcWut
[14:14:55] miketwng: @DrWetbone as a teacher, i agree but as an educator, i disagree. you need to punish the bad somehow.

[14:15:02] Trystah: @Trystah fr LUL
[14:15:04] cjohno20: Hot IC take: not having a single Chief of Police to guide the culture of the PD is making things extremely inefficient and causing tons of confusion/conflict
[14:15:09] sabada: its still a morale downer just to get daps for no real reasons
[14:15:12] CodeForTea: do daps fall off after time?
[14:15:14] puppietreats: Susge hmmmm
[14:15:14] seshpotato: but being suspended is still the problem
[14:15:17] ZachFromChat: he didnt get removed but he was kicked down so hard why would he want to show up? thats your point
[14:15:18] povdino: xqcEZ xqcArm2
[14:15:18] ToxiccLadd: removal from the PD shouldnt be the main concern Demoralization should be
[14:15:18] Willdragons: $remind @Is_a_Red https://clips.twitch.tv/PhilanthropicHelplessAmazonFailFish-ZMiVSbNa-XGsD3zP
[14:15:19] Supibot: willdragons, I will remind is_a_red when they next type in chat (ID 2658813)
[14:15:23] squirtlehermit: I guess his point is the "high command review" is just "do better"
[14:15:23] LordofDoinks: can you lose daps at all?
[14:15:24] cjohno20: A week suspension is insane lmao
[14:15:27] frostflakeheron: a week ?!

[14:15:43] leemuh_: @LordofDoinks after 60 irl days
[14:15:44] streptomyces: I don't understand how the DAPs last 60 days, that is insane in an RP world
[14:15:44] Fishspaghett: Sludge
[14:15:47] nathalas_: 1 week in game how long is it in real life ?
[14:15:47] cjohno20: A week in the streaming world is devastating...
[14:15:48] GD_Rep: @cjohno20 who is getting a week suspension?
[14:15:51] StormiNyan: Sludge kill them all
[14:15:53] GlitchyGunZ: you guys need a opposite of dap system like bonus paychecks to incentivize good behavior. @esfandtv
[14:15:53] nathalas_: or they 1:1 ?
[14:15:54] b3asy6: but it kills the want to come back and walk on thin ice
[14:15:57] DREEMLAN: where are those applications
[14:15:57] puppietreats: modCheck where thefuck are the 700 applicants sir
[14:15:57] FaramirRat: I mean he isn't wrong, when I f up at work I get "dabs" cause I deal with 10's or thousands of dollars, but after I get 7 all I gotta do is take a test and i'm fine, because they know its just little mistakes, otherwise work is great majority of the time.
[14:15:58] Spliphos1199: @nathalas_ 1 week

[14:16:01] ToxiccLadd: @nathalas_ it would be 1 week irl

[14:16:10] hosseinfel: did he tried to get you removed :D

[14:16:17] ViciousRumor: @LordofDoinks I think they drop off after 60 days per point
[14:16:22] Thedredgingjudge: But wasnt Rivers an ex cop? how is that not good for the department? And then cut off cause of sowing a glock is so weird imo
[14:16:24] Pwnrest: That's how I sit in my chair after 14 hours
[14:16:24] KNGRSM: They never have any FTOs available
[14:16:32] GlitchyGunZ: BASED @esfandtv
[14:16:32] Janman88: not beeing able to "work off" DAPs is a trap too

[14:20:54] DrWetbone: the soothing sound of Duncan‚Äôs voice is making me tired, can you accidentally punch him or cuff him?
[14:20:56] GlitchyGunZ: the expectation is you want your officer to come out of a punishment motivated to do better,  not depressed. @esfandtv

[14:21:01] Janman88: @KYslippy as if the captains would listen, besides andrews maybe
