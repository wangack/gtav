[4:44:30] Nightbot: Backseat gaming is annoying and ruins the experience for other viewers. Let Nora make mistakes, learn from them, play how she wants, not as you the viewer wants! Even though you may be trying to help, please just chill and enjoy the content. noraexKnife

[4:44:34] Nightbot: Yokkos_ Do not share in-game information regarding other players/content creators. Nora doesn't want to know and this can instead harm in-game decisions. This may result to a time out or ban without warning. (Meta-gaming is when you tell Nora what a different streamer is doing on the same server) Thank you. noraexPog
