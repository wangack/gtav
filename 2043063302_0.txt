[6:51:49] Sasquatchall: you guys gonna run into trouble with people reinvesting alot to the 20% threshold
[6:52:07] Sasquatchall: yall need hella capital early on or hope people defualt on a rent to own
[6:52:11] halos420: 100% people who invest should get priority on rent to owns.
[6:52:54] halos420: @Sasquatchall yeah i mean you could do a cap of 100k at 20% then it cascades downward
[6:53:21] ItsJoey_E: the contact deleted
[6:53:27] Fantasmx: how much money Gomey raised so far?

[6:55:09] venomag_: kebun10 kebun10
[6:57:27] Sasquatchall: as it sits right now, Section K isn't making much from the rent to owns as the markup is pretty much going towards ROI for investers. I think there is gonna be like just shy of 10% left to split among Section K
[6:57:33] sub_ohmu: Good shit
[6:58:39] nick_dr1ft: @Sasquatchall yeah, the real profits come when people start defaulting their rent to owns
[6:58:52] sub_ohmu: Should talk to K about giving investors prio on rent to own if they want too.
[6:58:56] Sasquatchall: absolutly
[6:59:37] halos420: @sub_ohmu ya thats what i was saying. its almost needed i feel like. anyone in on a rewnt to own should have to be an investor or at least 20k first
[6:59:52] halos420: of*
[7:00:15] wildbur91: what up timmac

[7:01:10] Nutthouze_Penguin: Heard him say his acc so many times LUL LUL LUL LUL
[7:01:16] wildbur91: those 20k should be enough for vinnys house thats perfect
[7:01:52] Gashlex: might as well share contract with K also
[7:01:58] Schags1: he's liquidated the entire city. people fear 1144
[7:02:14] Sasquatchall: I tried telling K that he should of bought the house last night and just go into debt incase someone bought a house in the area and now it cost more
[7:02:53] halos420: @Sasquatchall yeah i said that in chat as well but not alot of people buying houses

[7:03:41] viewlessd: g6 is crazy

[7:05:32] sub_ohmu: People need to start putting wheel clamps on G6 vans illegally parking all the time lol

[7:22:24] Sasquatchall: then just get all their state IDs
[7:22:29] Klammath_: Ya, it's interesting given the dynamic of importance in relation to reliability. Do I want stability at home? Sure. But I never want to invest to make it reliable. But at work, it's potentially life saving. Much different aspect.
