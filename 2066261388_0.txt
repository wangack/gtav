[1:39:45] HavocusRex: cornwood needs to realize the higher ups aren't his friends and what they want doesn't align with what he wants, imo of course
[1:39:51] FilzG: is this the crew that wants to join LASO?
[1:40:10] FilzG: @HavocusRex yeah I think if he opens it, he will still have to answer to the captains
[1:41:07] Bakemaan: oh my god he still doing that repeating thing KEKW
[1:41:14] Splitcookie713: lol
[1:41:14] magnets_: he says TO malton lmfao
[1:41:17] FilzG: but to be fair, LSDP doesnt really have the numbers to split up, just earlier they were mentioning shift one just had 1 person on duty
[1:41:19] SeriousOn: yea thats molton and he was in the meeting LUL
[1:42:00] HavocusRex: I could be wrong, but reading between the lines everyone that wants bcso, at the core of it, want new leadership and I think the caps see it that way too, and therefore resent it
[1:42:00] Bakemaan: he must just do it instinctively now KEKW
[1:42:12] Fightin_Amish: I think Cornwood should just focus on lobby to open department building and sheriff position will take care of itself
[1:42:14] Bakemaan: i wonder if he does it IRL KEKW
[1:42:28] FilzG: @HavocusRex yeah because everyone wants to move there, but you cant have everyone leave LSPD, so makes sense captains are worried

[1:43:34] j3llybsnip3n: drive a manual
[1:43:42] FilzG: but for me it shows a bigger problem in LSPD that everyone wants to move to another department
[1:43:46] j3llybsnip3n: problem solved
[1:43:50] FilzG: they should look at that first
[1:44:13] HavocusRex: yeah it'd take a lot of practice I imagine
[1:44:25] j3llybsnip3n: you play mnk?
[1:44:27] Bakemaan: no police vehicle should be manual, makes zero sense with all the tech they have to use
[1:44:29] Splitcookie713: understaffing could have been avoided if they took back the old cops. they could have started with lax sops if they were worried about balancing
[1:44:29] j3llybsnip3n: controller
[1:45:20] HavocusRex: When all those guys from project homecoming came to no pixel with controllers and just obliterated street racing lol
[1:45:30] FilzG: @Splitcookie713 also there are good cops that want to come in but they dont respond to the aplicants. Trav is a good example (Dickhead's character). He said he would put 60 hours a week in the PD and he knows everything since he was a cop before

[1:50:12] FilzG: this dap shit just needs to stop imo to have a better health in the department
[1:50:22] FilzG: they need a new way to "punish" their officers

[1:50:56] ItsEdBoi_: daps are fine how they are applied has been the problem
[1:50:57] HavocusRex: I agree that the daps should be there, but they shouldn't be able to hand out 4 daps at a time
[1:51:09] HavocusRex: It's not ok to stacks charges vs crims but it's ok to stack daps vs cops

[1:51:10] FilzG: @ItsEdBoi_ true that aswell

[1:51:31] FilzG: instead of stacking
[1:51:36] FilzG: that's an idea

[1:52:29] j3llybsnip3n: people need to make money, give um a brake lmao
[1:52:41] shlbainu: Dap's are enforced because in 3.0 strikes were issued on officers, and officers would have like 50  sometimes even 100 strike points and nothing would happen, this is why they're so enforced this time around.

[2:10:47] Bakemaan: on top of that the US dollar value is artificially inflated without a backing, the bubble is gonna explode in a spectacular fashion
[2:10:49] Pollyfuse: next step is digital currency
[2:11:02] ohwoww123: The future belongs to nepobabies, the poor are being discouraged from breeding.
[2:11:10] Pulveriser1: Just remember, Money (Currency) is the MEDIUM we use for Goods and Services. We could go back to bartering, the only thing here is Money is easier to move and store than 10 tonnes of items.
[2:11:21] Bakemaan: USD isnt backed by gold anymore
[2:11:24] LitLegend1: yee

[2:15:18] Rolymole09: @tyguyslays its 100% true. most banks are closing their store fronts. or open very little. making it harder and harder to ‚Äúdeposit cash‚Äù
[2:15:20] HavocusRex: BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) are trying to start their own club and get away from western influence, aka use their currencies instead of the dollar
[2:15:31] LoserWithAGoodHeart: I better see some amazing games with Ai in the future
[2:15:53] 420deandre: bro that statement is 1000 years
[2:16:00] Bakemaan: BRICS will never work, USD is too powerful in global trade.
[2:16:01] TyGuySlays: @Rolymole09 what banks...name one. havent seen a bank closure anywhere where I live. in fact ive seen two or three renovate and get bigger
[2:16:13] West_coast_tony: @HavocusRex and they are using gold to back it

[2:16:55] West_coast_tony: that is tiny font
[2:16:55] LitLegend1: can Chatgtp condense it for us Kappa
[2:16:57] mindspank: It's kinda crazy to think that most of us will see the advent of AGI and possibly ASI within our lifetimes
[2:17:05] 420deandre: yeah lets gooo
[2:17:07] LitLegend1: called it
[2:17:09] TyGuySlays: @Rolymole09 okay well UK economy is not the same lol....

[2:17:34] TyGuySlays: @Splitcookie713 well most drive thrus closed because of automated banking because its faster
[2:17:35] 420deandre: @Splitcookie713 why would they need that shit ever heard of a ATM?

[2:19:23] Splitcookie713: Employees making deposits or getting change for the business they work at is a good reason. Not every business owner will pay for the brinks truck to pull up.
[2:19:28] 420deandre: you only run out of you go crazy on it in a short timeframe

[2:22:57] deanb___: '96' mph
[2:22:59] CaptainQuirkalot: They ended up in the water after his pit and he drove off lmao
[2:23:08] Bakemaan: @Splitcookie713 small business rely on fast transactions for expenses etc etc, keeping it digital makes things smooth and fast
[2:23:13] HavocusRex: speaking of pitting, does anyone know what Denzels final dap was for? Was it the pit incident?
[2:23:16] West_coast_tony: dam crimes went from 0-100 real quick.  I remember when everyone was scared to do any crime

[2:23:18] Splitcookie713: hopefully someone has the clip of it
[2:23:23] CaptainQuirkalot: he went back after they 911 pinged
[2:23:28] TheRowdyRandy: she half drove herself over the barrier into the water
[2:23:37] LoserWithAGoodHeart: you should watch the cips
[2:23:39] Gurgle_Firewater: was it the pit off the ramp?
[2:23:39] 420deandre: now type, turn this summary into a image representing the scene
[2:23:40] LoserWithAGoodHeart: clips
[2:23:42] TyGuySlays: @Rolymole09 yes most ppl get paid bank transfer....but most businesses still prefer cash. small businesses defintely
[2:23:53] ItsEdBoi_: "rescued from the water after a failed escape attempt"

[2:24:36] Bakemaan: well im going to attempt to solder a bigger battery into my headset, wish me luck chat.
[2:24:42] TyGuySlays: @Bakemaan i agree its smooth and fast...but doesnt take away from cash being king. Cash isnt tracked, taxed as easily, doesnt cost anything for a business to take or deposit. Multiple reasons.
[2:24:43] shlbainu: omg that clip OMEGALUL

[2:26:37] shlbainu: The main reason the PD is getting sued is not because of the water, its because he pit a guy around 96 - 100mph when you cant pit over 100.
[2:26:38] hhhuuueeeyyy: my bad
[2:26:39] T00SCHWIFTY: if i was mod i would only spread minimal chaos and propaganda.

[5:43:19] JakeStratic: umm... did you just rob G6?
[5:43:38] Lepaca: that's what she said
[5:43:52] JakeStratic: How does that work?
[5:43:55] bobdang07hd: gonna find forte in a corner watching his YouTube video
[5:44:16] MountainMAN1990: Well the PD has been given a budget. Ever so gracefully by the Group 6 worker Trust. LUL
[5:44:28] MDM4ever1986HD: Is the money being put into evidence?
[5:44:37] MDM4ever1986HD: or is this money for PD?
[5:44:51] Sparbro2: pd was told theyre supposed to be self sufficient
[5:44:54] MountainMAN1990: Nah they can't use it
[5:44:58] Null_Value: Evidence runs
[5:45:12] MDM4ever1986HD: @MountainMAN1990 So it's for safe keeping?
[5:45:14] Baze_Ezra: @JakeStratic No. If the G6 job scuffs then they have to dispose of the pallets, so they give them to PD rather than dump them somewhere that crims can find them.
[5:45:17] Lepaca: scuffed G6 job, for some reason they have to dump the remaining pallets
[5:45:37] MountainMAN1990: @mdm4ever1986hd keeping it off the streets yep

[5:47:06] JakeStratic: tbh, i'd probably run the scuff cash into the ocean. So good on them
