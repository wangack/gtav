[7:53:50] LendoH: You can thank me for the money and time me out again, but it's because PD bias from 3.0 is showing now as people are getting hired. We're heading for hell week all over again. It sucks to watch as a viewer. You may view him differently, but other members of PD definitely view characters as exactly the same. Regardless of just the stuff that happened today.

[8:01:35] Satic: Malton the 🐍
[8:01:44] Lambo__TV: As a viewer that mainly watches LK who’s opinion doesn’t matter, I think he was pissed IC due to him being caught in MRPD and then not seeing an investigation happen to the other side (even though it may be in works). I mean if you were shot as a “victim” and then got raided and placed on a hold, I think everyone would be pissed. otherwise, love your RP. Gnight yall

[8:21:56] TMakBC: ramee really didn't put in enough effort to win
[8:22:08] buddha_hands: I think they hinged on other people bringing it up & yeah ramenos didn't really prepare for it
[8:22:50] jollypnda: ggs to the first cop who has drugs planted on them, its going to be a crazy uphill battle
[8:23:02] ManySadPandas: Yeah, Ramee was lost during this trial
[8:23:03] Kascade418: I'm willing to put money the prosecuting lawyer is going to be found with a PD weapon in a a couple days

[8:25:16] buddha_hands: JPs plan really backfired huh OMEGALUL
[8:25:27] StyxT9: LOL cops are more worried about protecting themselves for getting a gun planted on them than protecting others for it
[8:25:54] BakinPacman: I feel like the ability for cops to test for fingerprints kinda helps alot for the future

[8:27:28] StyxT9: @angus1794 That fact that they where just talking about it
[8:27:42] robertsmithjr: i was hoping murphy would have been acquitted of the charge, but also wanted ramee to take a loss to put him in check in court

[8:33:24] angus1794: any time they asked judge braun what happened, he gave them nothing, he presented himself as guilty
[8:33:38] Kevz95: “I was drunk I don’t remember” wasn’t good enough for PD to throw out the charge lmao
[8:33:39] Kascade418: Defending lawyers might have gotten tripped up by the charge not caring how he got the gun, just that he did
[8:33:44] Grumplestillskin: Murphy didn’t give them much to work with, OOC I feel like he may have wanted this outcome

[8:34:16] JC9R_: @Grumplestillskin ooc he did say he wanted this outcome but not his fast

[8:38:14] Dirk_Richter: Crane has already said there are gonna be conversations behind the scenes on it
[8:38:20] Purecrew: Nah I don't think Mr. K is going to appeal hes just going to go crazy.
[8:38:27] Leritt: 100% tmrw we will find few judges and stuff with pd glocks on them @jamieddd

[9:32:31] Great_Chachino: She isn't the only one with extreme bias
[9:32:31] lookingfornothinghere: because Ruth doesnt fall for dumb tricks and is by the book

[9:34:53] wavep987: the gall on people throwing hostages from water towers and then surprised that they get shoot

[9:36:05] Decimated_exo: @bjxnn she cant shoot being alone vs 6 people on scene
[9:36:06] lookingfornothinghere: one things i lowkey really like is that there is no more A A+ S tier system for cars so Cops dont have to play a guessing game
[9:36:15] jaacccckk: @sp0rkehNW While i agree theres been negativity about Ruth which is not justified, but she has done shit that is not justified...... Most recent shit i can tell is the Shiesty thing..... so ppl have made their perception of Ruth being like that

[9:36:32] Aethanyc: @dreggy69 Its not just crim viewers. She literally plays an uptight captain. Of course she's gonna get hate from both sides. And they were utterly unprepared for the search warrant which makes her look super bad.

[12:53:29] lewd_sister_of_battle: Jobs do tho right, its seems you can make very good money on the jobs available in 4.0. Crime seems like its decent pay but its also a choice of how you want to play your character?

[12:53:53] im_vylo: I always imagine Slacks turning crim, pretty sure you got rob a bank with just your voice.
[12:53:54] JeePecks: You're right tbh
[12:53:56] khlaah: crim will eventually pay out I think but over a longer period, i think there needs to be more "revenue unlocks" for crimminals, i think in time it'll pay but be pretty dangerous
[12:53:57] axiiiomatic: depends if they whitelist businesses and give ppl gas stations and what not
[12:53:59] bowflexing: so people have no choice for crime as they are banned from jobs

[12:57:31] travdaddygaming11: Maybe just focus on stuff that really matters instead of petty Crimes? Idk
[12:57:33] ButterVonWaffle: When rp imitates real life. Work = dealing with dumb shit.
[12:57:37] Eddie1225: what old PD
[12:57:37] bustn: I thought how hard you tried to talk K down yesterday was great
[12:57:38] settjungle1: the only problem on the pd on my opinion is the car chases, u guys never catch anyone haha
[12:57:39] thelosttwo: lang always calls the others rarely call 911
[12:57:45] venomag_: ngl Ruth is giving PD a bad name.
[12:57:45] luckylara: its a shitshow between d company, union CG and PD involving, and there is CIV. absolute shitshow
[12:57:46] Eddie1225: most old PD memmbers have already made new cops
[12:57:46] StreamElements: Please do not meta in chat, which means do not tell Saab stuff happening in RP that his character would otherwise not know.
[12:57:46] bowflexing: Oooh what if you guys set up a meet for them to talk it out in person, and just observe
[12:57:48] Eddie1225: and are hired
[12:57:56] fambaa: I mean X was getting chased like 4 or 5 times by cops the recent days, I was amazed he wasnt already caught
[12:57:57] sureshotwarrior: was mary gsr tested when she gave her statement with johnson?
[12:58:02] axiiiomatic: well it doesnt help that ruth had a character in 3.0 that literally did nothing but sit around in bushes and investigate shit for lang
[12:58:03] greyjulian: Ruth has enabled so much drama and RP, it’s amazing.  major kudos to Cheever
[12:58:05] josh1832000: you need more of Brian

[12:58:29] Dyslecsic: Well when K went off on her earlier Esfand was like "Yes! he knows"
[12:58:30] Dyslecsic: says enough
[12:58:33] Talker100: I know I'm beating a dead horse here, but the amount of work cornwood has put in, he deserves something
[12:58:33] Cosmic: 13 hours monkaEyes
[12:58:34] Eddie1225: we can always tell who actually doesn't watch whats going on OMEGALAUGHING
[12:58:44] khlaah: Ruth is 2nd only to Den Zel as my favorite cops that I watch right now, Cheever7 and Deansocool are a very good watch
[12:58:59] Alexqc19: Goes to bed wake up and see saab still live wtf is wrong with u OMEGALUL

[13:01:00] miksadin: @lazohe OMEGALUL
[13:01:00] tellos0: they changed the tow rules
[13:01:03] bowflexing: I'd make a cop, but probably a goofy one. It would be like a robocop. character development on death. =P

[13:01:09] lazohe: What daddy
[13:01:12] jersey_jesus: Tow has a lot of scuff
[13:01:12] Hinten97: G6 just too good
[13:01:12] fraudiola9: Yeah kinda they get 300 dollars a job
[13:01:17] fambaa: well probably the pay
[13:01:19] skympii: chat once the next meeting is over its gonna be a shit show so prepare your snacks OMEGALULiguess
[13:01:24] venomag_: feel bad
[13:01:29] theroganjosh: Also, G6 pays exponentially more right now.
[13:01:29] FearUS_28: G6 is where it's at right now for civs
[13:01:34] tellos0: yeah, only cops and towing ppl can now signal cars for towing
[13:01:42] davidf4735: @fraudiola9 Thats if your rep is higher. The starting is like 100 a job
[13:01:43] dillon_619: Hey thanks for a great stream it’s was some wild RP but I love it’s 😂 see ya next time
[13:01:48] bobbybobobobobob: shut uppp

[13:02:34] giorgiotodoroki: FirstTimeChatter2
[13:02:35] johnmalkovich95: Did someone talk with River? I missed
[13:02:37] davidf4735: @fraudiola9 100%. Esp if you have to wait for like 10 mins to even get a job lol
[13:02:40] bowflexing: G6 = Audi R8 + house
[13:02:50] tellos0: @johnmalkovich95 y, fired from academy
[13:02:59] johnmalkovich95: Look like he got upset a lot
[13:03:00] bowflexing: hahahaha

[13:03:22] HahAsORi: LMAOO
[13:03:23] malxyz789: Alex :(
[13:03:30] davidf4735: For a tier 3 G6 they can make 2k in 20 mins. But a max level tow makes 2k in like 2 or 3 hours
[13:03:41] WhoIsD33z: @Liminati yea but the thing he did was just way too dumb
[13:03:42] fambaa: G6 will get robbed and ppl will lose rep when they cant finish jobs and make no money
[13:03:46] jamieddd: @davidf4735 100 rep don't take long, well used to before 10min wait. 2.7 rep a job takes like 10mins. so around 7hours
[13:04:10] shady_malik: fambaa g6 getting robbed less now i think lol
[13:04:12] bowflexing: there was just a new crime outlet, but 250$ to run to sandy and back to town.
[13:04:22] chivvyy: finished his rep grind, exalted with tow faction EZ
[13:04:31] davidf4735: @jamieddd Ive been doing tow for days now and im barely at 60 rep. Its like .2 or .5 rep a job
[13:04:38] gryffindor1302: oh ye max rep at towing gives you free lockpick blueprint
[13:04:42] Kaztiell: @Liminati shouldnt have abused his gun license then
[13:04:44] fambaa: @shady_malik for now, but when things change, esp when they get guns it will get crazy 100%
