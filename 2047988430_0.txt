[1:06:19] Chrissy1337: i mean its a concerning trend but its something the server will deal with, no reason for viewers to loose their shit over
[1:06:28] StreamElements: There are bots currently going around Twitch whispering you about giveaways. These giveaways are a scam. DO NOT CLICK ANYTHING, just report them to Twitch and block them!
[1:06:31] gimpling_: PD lootboxes
[1:07:00] Nomnomperson: Hopefully once either civ or criminal guns get introduced properly the cop robbing will stop
[1:07:02] gimpling_: not much RP to come from that, they dont want RP just want your gun
[1:07:03] BubbaBeastt: so i understand the rper side of it ig, but like idk why randommike12454 is upset about a cop getting robbed when they likely dont play the server
[1:07:03] SaintjimmyTV: only thing stopping this from turning into lootboxing is people going around killing cops for their guns
[1:07:04] AlexanderMichael: sounds like "selfish rp" ? Like rp for myself but not for thee kinda thing
[1:07:29] LonelyChicken09: yuh
[1:07:30] LendSwag: i remember this being a thing since nopixel arma

[1:09:10] AfroAltruism: dAaa
[1:09:12] RealGasoline: Not enough Kappa
[1:09:12] BubbaBeastt: Out of curiosity unsure if ive ever found it out, what is the player cap for the server? like approx how many people can be in it at one time?
[1:09:14] Chrissy1337: a lot eastcoast1982

[1:09:43] Wildsmasher: why has the police not got a helicopter yet??
[1:09:53] eastcoast1982: this wild
[1:10:03] Chrissy1337: because its not needed Wildsmasher and there is no budget for it yet
[1:10:04] Wildsmasher: wtf lol
[1:10:24] thatclubdj: @wildsmasher cause the city just got a mayor lol
[1:10:34] RealGasoline: How are cops gonna have a budget for a PD heli if they don't even have guns Kappa
[1:10:42] Largely_Sauce: I think they have to build a case for it and then apply
[1:10:42] Chrissy1337: 4.0 is a fresh and slower paced version of the server, stuff gets rolled out slowly but surely
[1:10:44] alliballibeee: The new hospital looks great 👍🏻
[1:10:50] AlexanderMichael: Yea I like that the pd hasn't had a knee jerk reaction to speed things up just cause

[1:11:31] Snellious: is possession of pd equipment as hefty as it once was?
[1:11:34] kerndeezy: he'd put a turbo in it too KEKW
[1:11:46] BubbaBeastt: was it higher or lower in 3.0? only reason i ask is I always remember seeing random people in 3.0 and was wondering how many ppl cap used to be then?
[1:11:58] Soul_Hero: uhsVibe

[1:13:11] BubbaBeastt: Jean Paul raid would pay for a helicopter on its own with just his fines KEKW
[1:13:24] thatclubdj: @bubbabeastt it increased somewhere in the middle of 3.0 iirc
[1:13:54] zrussell93: Welp just jinxed it KEKW
[1:14:03] Chrissy1337: server cap changed depending on the amount of cops around in 3.0

[1:14:38] SquishIsShort: getting shot = turtle time got it XD

[1:15:05] BubbaBeastt: Gotcha, interesting how taht stuff works
[1:15:09] thatclubdj: @chrissy1337 they did a big jump up too right? Which is why the quantity over quality line became a thing?

[2:40:12] SquishIsShort: repeat covid infections are bad and can lead to long covid. recent studies have shown that Covid behaves like HIV in the way it attacks your immune system and that it can mutate and hide, however unlike HIV covid can be transmitted through the air. covid infections have been on the rise again
