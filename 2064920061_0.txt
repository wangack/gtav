[0:55:11] Fossabot: In role-playing games, metagaming is an "out of character" action where a player's character makes use of knowledge that the player is aware of but that the character is not meant to be aware of. Giving Moon information on what's happening in another stream facilitates metagaming and ruins the experience for everyone.

[4:09:39] Gr1mm4ss: the things that make the biggest difference are little things u barely notice
[4:09:40] xEvilGoodGuyx: might be in good shape by the time GTA6 RP starts happening Kappa
[4:09:41] dullposer: This server practically doesn't have anything

[4:09:47] chizilla_tv: Let em Cook
[4:09:47] Gwnquinten: why did they launch it so soon? because of the gta sub thing?
[4:09:48] Zinski66: seems rushed
[4:09:51] RevenantHex: should have waited to launch

[4:10:11] wanderingSKULL: can anyone even afford a house tho
[4:10:19] d00d32: Are they trying to build mods from scratch?  You download/buy a mod script and configured it for the server.
[4:10:19] YazMp4: theyre on a good path
[4:10:28] F4ILS4FE: they should really invest some money to get this server caught up

[4:44:47] mentallynumb1: I don't see why they couldn't have just buffed the standard cop vehicles rather that nerf the civilian cars
[4:44:51] DimitrisMassivePhallus: Maybe the new Meta is to stand in crosswalks until a speeding cop runs you over, then sue them.

[4:46:09] F4ILS4FE: I'm telling you, they should have cars bought stay with the specs of the patch they were bought on. New patch should ONLY change new cars of that model
[4:46:11] ROCKscissorsPIZZA: you might have driven the admiral maxed out after upgrades.

[4:48:22] Bishata: teeny bopper commies
[4:48:22] crabhowse: No rents around
[4:48:23] Kluules: They were trying to get him for gambling, he said he's taking a Melvin break and playing Sven for awhile
[4:48:25] soundOrbit: kinda they were taking him to court for like 18,000 dollars that he never made
[4:48:32] mentallynumb1: haven't seen steve on in a minute, speaking of which. unless i just missed it
[4:48:35] poodlchu: You ever see the law doing this?
[4:48:40] crabhowse: Oh. My. God.
[4:48:49] ThHolyMonky: yeah
[4:48:53] ThHolyMonky: not kosher
[4:48:55] crabhowse: moonTRUTH moonCheers
[4:49:00] mentallynumb1: definitely agree with moon on this one
[4:49:04] Dribbz95: Gonna kill the server
[4:49:06] Meatloaph: Even if they dont get to own them dont shut em down
[4:49:09] soundOrbit: there was nothing to do and Melvin filled a whole to give people something to do
[4:49:09] Kluules: Updating in reverse
[4:49:14] fumesntunes: 👍
[4:49:16] soundOrbit: hole
[4:49:16] xEvilGoodGuyx: 1 person probably complained
[4:49:17] Zinski66: player made events are the only thing this server has to make up for the lack of general mechanics
[4:49:26] ROCKscissorsPIZZA: these organic rp locations are actually a product of the lack of in server game mechanics.
[4:49:31] Fictshn: like you told Frank.. if someone has a better business plan anyone can own the place
[4:49:34] LiizetP99: moonNONSUB
[4:49:39] crabhowse: Too many egos kill good luck

[4:49:53] crabhowse: Happens all the time
[4:50:05] TheAmazinE: he was even providing the cars
[4:50:06] fumesntunes: Killing RP
[4:50:07] chronochris64twitch: moonLurk
[4:50:16] Talis_9: It's just The Man oppressing innovation and keeping the people down
[4:50:18] poodlchu: FeelsWeirdMan
[4:50:18] mentallynumb1: yeah we don't know for sure.. let's stay optimistic
[4:50:18] ThHolyMonky: yeah just kills Roleplay
[4:50:27] The_real_merc: what up @mrmoonshouse
[4:50:29] Meatloaph: KEKW
[4:50:29] F4ILS4FE: people who don't understand RP do that kind of thing
[4:50:30] ThHolyMonky: jesus
[4:50:32] Kluules: @thholymonky 100%
[4:50:37] ThHolyMonky: thes fucking DUDES
[4:50:40] mentallynumb1: would hate to see this storyline to go down like ignite. I'm invested
[4:50:44] ThHolyMonky: LUL LUL
[4:50:47] Talis_9: This thing does like 115 Moon
[4:50:47] BullPot: LUL

[4:50:57] crabhowse: Loosen the grip and embrace freedom
[4:50:57] ThHolyMonky: moonBlood
[4:50:57] m0nstrz: I feel like this might be an unpopular opinion but i feel like having too many mechanics can ruin the server. People just treat it like "expanded" GTA Online.
[4:50:58] supersaiyan__jimlahey: jamLUL jamLUL
[4:51:04] poodlchu: LUL
[4:51:04] 1888: KEKW we good

[4:51:07] Meatloaph: KEKW
[4:51:08] Talis_9: This ain't gonna end well
[4:51:09] TheAmazinE: mopClap
[4:51:16] Fossabot: If you are enjoying the stream you can subscribe and directly support Mr. Moon gaining access to exclusive emotes!: subs.twitch.tv/mrmoonshouse
[4:51:18] mentallynumb1: roflmao
[4:51:21] ThHolyMonky: this server in a nutshell
[4:51:21] BoozeMarlin: server really needs a community meeting imo
[4:51:36] F4ILS4FE: if this was Saint's Row, it would have Car Surfing
[4:51:39] PeculiarStain: Tommy about to die
[4:51:47] Banaynay_: so to clarify, we were told we cant claim the spots in our ADs and say we own the buildings, we can still service vehicles if they come there but to put a focus on going around to fix vehicles and getting phone calls to fix them
[4:51:49] Fossabot: Don't forget you can SUBSCRIBE FOR FREE if you have an Amazon Prime account. Just connect it to your Twitch here: https://twitch.amazon.com/prime
[4:51:58] RicklePick55: That may be the worst looking vehicle I’ve ever seen… LUL WutFace WutFace
[4:52:16] mentallynumb1: @Banaynay_ what does AD mean?
[4:52:32] xEvilGoodGuyx: AD = advertisement lol
[4:52:33] Syrinx69_: roadmap
[4:52:41] F4ILS4FE: @Banaynay_ that's just odd
[4:52:43] mentallynumb1: oh duh lol
[4:52:50] mrmoon_step_son: Not true mechanics are what makes it possible to do these things what everyone wanting @m0nstrz
[4:52:54] soundOrbit: or what is available now, that we don’t know about
[4:53:07] soundOrbit: if anything
[4:53:13] Shankyn: i feel like a community meeting once in a while would do well
[4:53:15] Zinski66: Maybe you can become the community outreach manager
[4:53:22] xXlSHIFTYlXx: maybe if you sold in silicon valley type area, crypto may be a better chance?
[4:53:24] Kluules: You're to nice to the server Moon, you are a good guy, but the server is going backwards
[4:53:30] fumesntunes: Kills RP
[4:53:33] VanillaBraun: itll get there lets just rp
[4:53:33] mrphat420: @Kluules +1
[4:53:35] Syrinx69_: Or just a general talk about what everyone wants
[4:53:35] TobeyTobes93: roadmap = "find out in RP"
[4:53:37] soundOrbit: the road map is that onix Trailer
[4:53:43] sewer_baby: i wish i could rp there. looks like it can be fun to own a business
[4:53:43] RevenantHex: road map? they don't even release patch notes
[4:53:46] F4ILS4FE: Moon, you need to start your own server
[4:53:48] BullPot: People just need to realize this is a young server. Remember when nopixel was 32 slots and was the pink cage and oxy runs. Same is happening here, takes time. This instant gratification shit is concerning
[4:53:51] azthroxx: how do u get into custom servers like this
[4:53:58] mentallynumb1: moon trying to stay optimistic cuz he loves to RP tommy
[4:54:00] crabhowse: It's rp why is there so much micro management bullshit. I am not even on it but come on guys. Loosen up it's not that serious it's wild
[4:54:01] dullposer: It's not going anywhere
[4:54:14] jonnygt1: they prolly don't even kno
[4:54:16] YazMp4: THAT GETS THE BALL ROLING
[4:54:17] Meatloaph: On GTA yes
[4:54:24] Kluules: Shouldn't be a problem
[4:54:27] YazMp4: how would they know otherwise
[4:54:31] AMGTV: General road map wouldn't hurt
[4:54:36] azthroxx: how do u get into servers like this
[4:54:40] TobeyTobes93: its hard to communicate if they think the more communication means meta
[4:54:41] ThHolyMonky: the alternative is spending hours chasing clues
[4:54:44] mrmoon_step_son: Keeping it gate kept prolonging RP LUL
[4:54:49] F4ILS4FE: need more transparency for the server
[4:54:56] jaktreequitter: floss my azz cheeks with a string n shiet moonROACH
[4:54:57] illumoxx: it shouldn't be a problem if it's RP first like they say they want
[4:55:00] mentallynumb1: I think no patch notes under the guise of "realistic" is a bit too far when there's so little to do and patch notes might give people avenues to go on
[4:55:06] bigbobbscrazy88: It'll end up like wild no updates
[4:55:07] m0nstrz: Too many mechanics can ruin the server. Thats where i feel like NoPixel is a victim of their own success they attract GTA Online players rather than RPrs
[4:55:08] Meatloaph: Unless its a shit server LUL
[4:55:13] F4ILS4FE: Mostly only streamers get approved
[4:55:15] iterativeProcess: or run your own
[4:55:19] edarmoc: have 35+ years in rp, like MrMoon
[4:55:24] sewer_baby: it feels like they want Twitch streamers is the vibe i got from the app
[4:55:26] Bear_Lair: you only need to wait 5 months for the applicatin
[4:55:29] iambutaman: can i put you as reference?
[4:55:29] phinsley: I feel like once the knowledge of new mechanics becomes widespread, that same influx of mechanic use will still happen. If they release patch notes it will at least get that phase of newly-introduced mechanics over with sooner
[4:55:30] B_dubz95: most are public this one is private so you have to apply
[4:55:32] poodlchu: I'd like to apply my name is Rommy Toach :)
[4:55:32] Kluules: @bigbobbscrazy88 Wild is supposed to have an update soon
[4:55:36] crabhowse: Again I will say I didn't come to watch Court for 10 hours. And the fact that happens for soooo long even live is fucked to me and that's just my opinion
[4:55:36] ThHolyMonky: we are all just feeling it a lil bit moonWok
[4:55:41] Kluules: Penny doesn't stream
[4:55:44] Banaynay_: I've met more non streamers than streamers on onx
[4:55:46] AMGTV: Mei doesn't stream
[4:55:46] Meatloaph: Not quite KEKW
[4:55:47] Bear_Lair: TRUE
[4:55:52] crabhowse: It's like a window inside the room of what goes on internally
[4:55:54] chronochris64twitch: 315 streamers def
[4:55:59] Bear_Lair: I have not gotten approved yet
[4:56:06] ThHolyMonky: Penny doesn't stream
[4:56:07] ROCKscissorsPIZZA: some communication would help, the unknown leaves people frustrated. A community or team "podcast" or something   would reduce that alot.  Players invest alot of energy and its nice to have reassurance they are in a good place.
[4:56:18] xEvilGoodGuyx: hell, Coolidge doesn't even stream most of the time LUL
[4:56:18] jaktreequitter: most players on onx dont stream lol
[4:56:19] Bear_Lair: I applied since the beginning
[4:56:20] sewer_baby: ill have to apply
[4:56:22] crabhowse: moonTOOMUCH
[4:56:23] mentallynumb1: I feel like they could RP patch notes with a little bit of creativity
[4:56:26] Zinski66: Tell em
[4:56:32] mrphat420: is it bad to say there are public servers with more mechanics and more to do Kappa LUL
[4:56:38] Tondye: i fuckin made it finally
[4:56:44] iterativeProcess: how has the queue been compared to the last time Tommy saw Jesse?
[4:56:48] BCbuddahSMOKE: It'll take more time than we expected hopefully shit will get better
[4:56:53] ThHolyMonky: there it fucking is
[4:56:54] Kluules: @tondye do you stream
[4:56:55] Talis_9: Probably the majority don't stream, many also barely RP
[4:56:55] sewer_baby: id love to try and rp.  Id take it seriously
[4:56:57] Banaynay_: I agree
[4:57:00] Fictshn: only reason the servers still going is the people
[4:57:06] ThHolyMonky: PUT ON THE PANTS
[4:57:08] gman7e: yup
[4:57:11] Zerorush7: LUL
[4:57:11] Bear_Lair: you have to pay for your application to be pushed
[4:57:13] TobeyTobes93: Moon for Community Manager
[4:57:14] leomanechest: if the cops are onto you - they should get you like 9/10 times
[4:57:15] EndlessNameless0: moonCheers moonROCK
[4:57:16] mentallynumb1: hit it one more time for me, please!
[4:57:21] soundOrbit: eeeek
[4:57:24] Syrinx69_: streaming is a good record of someone's RP abilities but I wouldn't say it is required
[4:57:30] Tondye: @Kluules uhh not really?
[4:57:32] ThHolyMonky: or months LUL
[4:57:37] poodlchu: I speculate the reason to stay tight lipped is because changes are far out
[4:57:44] jonnygt1: good luck wit that i hav trouble getting people to agree on the basics half the time
[4:57:45] iterativeProcess: hells yes
[4:57:50] Kluules: @tondye and you got in?
[4:57:51] Bear_Lair: NO! NOT WEEKS MONTHS
[4:57:57] Meatloaph: we out here moonROACH
[4:58:01] Gallatyn: we're keepin' it real, chat
[4:58:04] Tondye: @Kluules wat you talkin bout lol?
[4:58:15] Meatloaph: stolen EZ
[4:58:29] Bear_Lair: I applied when it was released. Still no response on it
[4:58:42] knot_an_alien: Is this the last onyx stream? BibleThump
[4:58:43] Bear_Lair: That was months ago!
[4:58:48] Kluules: @tondye you said you made it, I thought you meant into the server, sry
[4:58:49] kantancerous: but having a role on onx would make you stuck with gta? that's gonna be stale imo
[4:58:54] Talis_9: Penny got turned down initially but kept at it and eventually got in, she doesn't stream
[4:59:02] Tondye: @Kluules no lol just got off work and made it in the stream
[4:59:04] PeculiarStain: moon math
[4:59:06] AfternoonCondition: the car looks better slow
[4:59:19] Kluules: @tondye lolol welcome!! Lol
[4:59:24] Bear_Lair: She paid to push her application
[4:59:25] Syrinx69_: Did SilentSentry give up trying to get on or just doesn't care about RP anymore
[4:59:26] ThHolyMonky: prostitution is legal say its that
[4:59:35] TampaTeeJay: Rico case pending
[4:59:40] Bear_Lair: Sentry doesnt do RP anymore
[4:59:45] Kluules: @tondye it's been a good one,
[5:00:06] Syrinx69_: Thats a shame he is amazing at RP
[5:00:11] Dribbz95: Sentry is still trying to escape tarkov.
[5:00:26] Talis_9: I miss Emmet, he was so good
[5:00:27] Meatloaph: he could've made at least 10k begging by now
[5:00:28] BuddyFerngrove: especially if poker was in the server
[5:00:32] iterativeProcess: pretty sure Sentry was on as one of the bailiffs. sounded like em anyways
[5:00:36] rowdy_dog1: one of the best
[5:00:40] Kluules: @talis_9 emmit was awesome
[5:00:45] Bear_Lair: He tries to critic every detail he doesnt like
[5:00:55] ishoothotlove: sentry goes on waves. he will be back. and I will be waiting
[5:00:56] Meatloaph: tru
[5:01:07] RevenantHex: the old crew with Emmet was so fun
[5:01:09] Fictshn: theres some guy that sounds like Emmet
[5:01:11] SAAdesigner: I appreciate his passion.
[5:01:11] ROCKscissorsPIZZA: hes so talented, id love to see him on Onx
[5:01:15] Bear_Lair: yes
[5:01:19] Meatloaph: Geo skimmin off the top
[5:01:21] Ben_Gasoline: :O
[5:01:25] hell0apollo: he complains about literally everything
[5:01:26] iterativeProcess: GD horseflies
[5:01:35] AdoptedGaming: hahahaha
[5:01:35] Bear_Lair: I guess. it does bore me when the rant goes on
[5:01:38] Banaynay_: sentry would 100% do rp, he's probably just waiting to see how things go before dipping in
[5:01:39] gman7e: tit for tat
[5:02:01] Meatloaph: skimmin mfk
[5:02:06] Chewith74: he yucks some of my yums but thats life
[5:02:15] Talis_9: I saw Jethro pushing a shopping cart, that may lure Sentry in
