[1:01:55] silvergoeshard: @ForcerPT its 5% now
[1:02:04] pronoobgamer71: Just add 1 k to your next run
[1:02:07] Kazeumi: yea and i am sure there is a degree of error as well
[1:02:07] silvergoeshard: it is
[1:02:09] EyeScraem: it was 5% last week LUL
[1:02:09] silvergoeshard: it changed

[1:03:04] xscoxevox: Just bring it up to the treasurer?
[1:03:11] shadow__fx: Welcome to gang life
[1:03:22] EyeScraem: if only they tried doing PepeLa they would be call you for a pick up all the time
[1:03:23] ketsu93: jewelry is terrible 1500$ per run you get 5% so 75$ per run OMEGALUL
[1:03:24] milkydeew: @shadow__fx Nah thats Scam life
[1:03:29] RenTheRock: Tony almost went to jail because of it
[1:03:36] valorant_godlike: still
[1:03:36] Khaos_The_Lock: Your cleaning is very very important to the group
[1:03:38] Firepokachu: if anything should take a hit it should be jewelry runs that take a hit
[1:03:43] s13epy: @cyderverse you are my favorite corporate drone type vibe
[1:03:43] Firepokachu: not cleaning
[1:03:44] Mixcy9: You could do some chopping but keep the money
[1:03:51] CYDERVERSE: @s13epy catsittingverycomfortable
[1:03:52] sirchardo: If they end up doing "roles" I hope it becomes more about making sure your jobs are cleared out and less about specific money
[1:03:56] qvbxx: crime doesnt pay in general
[1:03:56] Mixcy9: You don't have to always do it for the crew
[1:04:04] allotras: pushers make 700 per hour too crime profits are shit :D
[1:04:10] shadow__fx: @milkydeew, its either that or you use your own money to pay fo the group
[1:04:11] moonypxl: nodd for the group
[1:04:15] valorant_godlike: where is your car why you rent cars ?
[1:04:17] OmegamonX: GIGAGOOF Actually guys I don't need the measly 5% just put it towards the crew. GIGAGOOF
[1:04:18] CYDERVERSE: At least Kitty stays rich KEKW
[1:04:20] xscoxevox: It a new system there is going to be flaws just need work them out
[1:04:21] silvergoeshard: its not that profitable as everyone think
[1:04:26] chapternine1279: But your kickback should be juicy
[1:04:31] s13epy: Return of the "under 1 mil = poor"
[1:04:31] lightstormclaw: crime isnt supposed to pay a whole lot thats why having a clean image is important
[1:04:39] jadedwrong: what ur gonna spend money on next?
[1:04:40] bbcherry24: Chopping is the way if you note the parts down 😂
[1:04:41] EyeScraem: @chapternine1279 nah it will only be like 4500
[1:04:44] xpertout: Why do we need to be a subscriber to watch old streams?
[1:04:44] Unnar: I mean at the end of the day the crew that one is a part off get's the money, for more houses etc, it's not like they are gonna  be buying a fancy car for buddha with that money
[1:05:03] RenTheRock: not in this economy
[1:05:04] Auruanix: pushers get 55% and that's 700 per hour, crime doesn't pay
[1:05:11] CYDERVERSE: @xpertout Cuz that's how it is shrujj
[1:05:15] royboy109: What the water at
[1:05:15] ketsu93: for money it's best to bring in jewellery and have other ppl do runs and clean
[1:05:21] s13epy: Man sitting on 450K of cars... I am poor Sadge
[1:05:22] bbcherry24: Hate to say it but everyone in this economy is gonna be "poor"
[1:05:23] Mixcy9: Why not for every 2 cars you chop
[1:05:38] il_capitano91: if you chop cars and do all the cleaning you get 70 % I think right?
[1:05:38] AK1N0M_: how are you smoking with a mask
[1:05:43] Mixcy9: One is for the group and the others you keep the money for yourself
[1:05:52] valorant_godlike: @bbcherry24 sure
[1:05:57] kaantufekci34: Who is tony? PTSD
[1:06:04] CYDERVERSE: You stink
[1:06:05] frzni: I think they've just factored in the potential future profits to those job payouts. Just need to wait and see.
[1:06:07] chapternine1279: If u needed a loan for a car who would you ask?
[1:06:09] abexxiii: it seems only robbing G6 makes money for crim... not sure though
[1:06:13] EyeScraem: no wonder kitty says you smell smh

[1:07:12] s13epy: @CY is there a way to check the pp+
[1:07:21] CYDERVERSE: @s13epy wha huh
[1:07:22] JohnnyMack__: alooo
[1:07:25] milkydeew: @shadow__fx 5 percent isn't worth it the fine is bigger than the reward, where pushers are getting 40 percent. theses no incentive to do these money runs or Jewelry runs, 10 percent is fair.
[1:07:33] moonypxl: johnny alooo
[1:07:44] moonypxl: huh sleepy
[1:07:55] s13epy: @cyderverse partner plus or pp+ SeemsGood
[1:08:04] DaDidouAhmed: like 150 more for partner plus
[1:08:11] CYDERVERSE: @s13epy If you scroll down, there should be a bar that shows the progress
[1:08:14] xscoxevox: 70%
[1:08:30] chapternine1279: You should talk to GiGi about the cuts
[1:08:30] s13epy: @cyderverse looks at scroll wheel on phone
[1:08:32] Mixcy9: If you do everything you keep 70% of the money
[1:08:32] Khaos_The_Lock: Yeah it makes 0 sense
[1:08:39] KentKLS: everyone should help going to the sewer was the deal
[1:08:40] iLLuSi0NN: its risk reward
[1:08:47] milkydeew: doing the chop does this mean you have to buy the tool?
[1:09:02] HueyO: Pushing weed is probably the worse even though they get 55%, risk of shot, stab, police fine and raided.
[1:09:04] JayKmm: basically if you do everything you get 70% and give 30% to the crew
[1:09:07] Kazeumi: its all pixels
[1:09:11] sirchardo: @KentKLS I mean with some of the people wanting to live in the sewers now atm they should be doing all of that trading in unless some people want rep
[1:09:13] DarthRadonis: it would
[1:09:13] CYDERVERSE: @s13epy oh. I don't think you can check progress on mobile catsittingverycomfortable
[1:09:24] xscoxevox: Yea
[1:09:27] Dbrou_: No you can’t Cy
[1:09:36] DaDidouAhmed: 10% of jewelry means it's 150$ a run
[1:09:40] frzni: Like what value does one assign to that rep. Also what kind of value does one give to crew having excess cash on hand to make purchases immediately when needed.
[1:09:42] CYDERVERSE: Working hard GIGACHAD That's our Octo
[1:09:56] il_capitano91: yea harry said that they should change it maybe to 50/50 or something
[1:10:00] Auruanix: the percentages will always need tweaking, esp if devs change things
[1:10:07] Mixcy9: You could ask Tony to do it for you
[1:10:11] ketsu93: you get 150$ per run if 10% OMEGALUL
[1:10:12] qvbxx: there needs to be a capp on jewelery brought into the house
[1:10:22] Khaos_The_Lock: 5% means you get $75 per jewelry run lmao
[1:10:46] taylor2electricboogaloo: There's a lot of balancing to do with the payouts. Considering the risk, the time investment, and how valuable getting it done is to the crew. Hard to balance all three
[1:10:46] secret_passengerr: a balance not a capp
[1:10:49] s13epy: @khaos_the_lock but he gets to drive cool car Kappa
[1:10:50] TyrantFPS: harry just did jewery runs for free cuz he said it wasnt worth logging
[1:10:50] ketsu93: that is 💀
[1:10:53] DarthRadonis: The cuts/spilts will prolly change after a couple weeks of trying this process out to make sure people are paid out properly
[1:10:54] EyeScraem: its why keeping track of dirty money brought in is so important LUL
[1:10:55] Firepokachu: only

[1:11:27] DaDidouAhmed: @Khaos_The_Lock did they actually drop it to 5% ?
[1:11:33] Mixcy9: Do you know what you get for MAX Rep at Chopping?
[1:12:02] s13epy: Nah grinders will chop the car in the dame driveway they steal the car from
[1:12:08] sarahm9889: did you send your feedback on chopping?
[1:12:13] s13epy: Same*
[1:12:13] ToxicSmolBean: I wish I could play Forza but I don't have an Xbox I have a ps5😭

[4:27:24] Roe_the_Second: so does this mean that the boxes will keep carrying over jobs till it all lines up?

[4:28:03] fng78: nodd
[4:28:20] Roe_the_Second: still not terrible for pay-wise.
[4:28:36] OmgSofie: so its just more smaller pays, instead of one big?
[4:28:37] xdannyx98: nah i fully understood it...not like Sofie or fng

[4:29:02] xdannyx98: oki Sadge
[4:29:12] nyxxnight: neutrenLove shxtouLove
[4:29:15] nautilus201: My take on this is that: the boxes are probably linked to the truck, if you use the truck to fill one trailer that gets blown up and you take out another trailer the boxes might “spawn” in the new one. This might happen because the game treats the new trailer as the old one, cause it’s the same truck

[4:30:19] argonize: boxes shouldnt count for the next job though right?
[4:30:23] Firepokachu: if your trailer blows up you can just pick up a new one and have all the boxes
[4:30:26] sarahm9889: that's a good solution to how fragile the trailers are
[4:30:37] xdannyx98: @fng78 boxes bing bong bing to truck bong bing nodd

[4:31:04] fng78: danny not being helpfull classic
[4:31:16] Firepokachu: so for the min max you ditch the cargo bomb it up north and just pick up a new cargo trailer
[4:31:21] Splashy_Pants: that was a very nice parking job
[4:31:29] Firepokachu: which might be a bit powerful
[4:31:34] KumiXIV: so they just copied the cargo into the truck KEK
