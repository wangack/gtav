[1:51:28] ShinJiHun: @MsHollyyy he could've said "I don't remember exactly what I said" instead of "I never said a word about grandma" like 5 times
[1:51:30] TheMah1337: What is his goal with this conversation
[1:51:34] PepperAnn131: For Johnson, answering "no" equals "I don't recall".
[1:51:36] SarahFlare: it's an at will state - Ramee has absolutely no privilege to the report.
[1:51:37] buddha_hands: he completely screwed himself with how he reacted

[1:53:05] jollypnda: if they want to try the targeted route then they would need to point out the disparity in punish between him and the officers that did nothing to interject
[1:53:06] Satic: Round and round the conversation goes
[1:53:07] scritr: slacks being nice, proceeds to get shit on classic

[2:05:29] catloyalist: ......
[2:05:32] MsHollyyy: @Mic_Stargazer Cornwood did a good job explaining and expressing and didn't just cut Johnson off and I think Johnson understood when he didn't feel like he needed to be defensive.
[2:05:39] wonder8er: no matter what you say no one is gonna change their opinions
[2:05:41] Jibry: he did the same thing during the suspension raising his voice to Slacks and Ruby
[2:05:50] knowlightnofear: "i'm really just asking" is such a bogus phrase
[2:06:04] magnets_: "did you back up and heal and take your vest off before reengaging?"
[2:06:04] Artsii1994: He did this to himself and just dug himself a grave.
[2:06:10] Mic_Stargazer: @Mic_Stargazer Yeah last I saw Johnson he softened up a bit, i think they're just trying to rush too fast back into PD. There's other RP out there
[2:06:24] spicyville: well to be fair ramee isn’t usually actually interested in the answer to his questions
[2:06:25] zenyatta: ramee wants a cop who owes him a big one thats why he wants johnson back in so badly DankThink
[2:06:28] sshineysean: Prediction: Johnson is going to go full sicko mode (including murdering cops) until the cops gun him down … and he Perma the character
[2:06:31] m1tchole: I hope Johnson finds a way to redeem himself
[2:06:33] Gabilonski: bro its crazy johnson isnt really a bad guy but he needs to know how to answer questions accurately
[2:06:39] PepperAnn131: How often did he do the classic: Ask a question and then 3 words into the answer interrupt with: "Nonono, listen to me!"
[2:06:50] lora1969: i need the sexy hair back KenMain
[2:06:51] wonder8er: ramee just getting names to witch hunt KEKW
[2:07:34] Mic_Stargazer: they're trying to rush it is all
[2:07:36] Faildude: @Ssaab ramee wanted to unlock den being suspended and nobody is telling him LUL
[2:07:42] aguy02: you are 100% correct tho
[2:07:43] TimmayHS: Ramee of all people being involved in an issue with "accountability", "guns", etc.. so fucking rich
[2:07:46] NumbLee: like Slack's is ever going to make it out of MRPD to drive
[2:07:51] Chaoszero_goc: If johnson said sorry and played it different but hes being wild about it
[2:07:52] MyDoSe_: It used to feel bad until the gun purchasing.
[2:07:52] fellathedude: Johnson keeps doubling down for some reason
[2:07:55] Scrando: Johnson and cornwood had a good conversation but it didn’t go anywhere Sadge
[2:07:56] T2Apex: i don't see a way back for johnson LUL
[2:07:59] MarsCons: feel like johnson really didn't remember
[2:08:04] YEP46: No, even cornwood already said, johnson cannot be saved because his story not lineup
[2:08:07] DonnieRockettt: well Johnson understood but Ramee.. its okay LUL
[2:08:08] Krimson07_: he should make a new pd char imo, theres no way the pd will trust him
[2:08:12] catloyalist: .........
[2:08:13] MarsCons: yeah, that's true
[2:08:14] Mic_Stargazer: Like is it jsut not a willingness to do RP that isn't PD? Like does it happen where cops don't know what to do on their cop character off duty or something?
[2:08:14] wonder8er: you are not mean to ramee, nowhere near he is to any officer KEKW
[2:08:16] Artsii1994: There is a dhree where you have to step your foot doen and it sucks but the story has to continue
[2:08:18] TimmayHS: I still feel like he should have been suspended for like a week and get 5 daps without being let go.. personally. But I get it
[2:08:21] SarahFlare: But Johnson doesn't take any responsibility. It's all "I don't recall" "I was never told" "I didn't know".
[2:08:21] ShinJiHun: @Scrando they don't understand that admitting he fucked up and working to rectify it is the way to go
[2:08:21] sonadapop: De Rolo
[2:08:27] MyDoSe_: He still hasnt taken accountability, which is crazy

[2:09:03] meeto_tv: i love hall
[2:09:12] javibcardi: saabKEK
[2:09:12] Jibry: the fact that Johnson didn’t read an announcement that was on the announcement board two weeks and says “Well I didn’t know”
[2:09:15] brentvargas: its such lil things though
[2:09:15] Laticore: You slacks you disrespected him by saying the truth LULW
[2:09:16] YEP46: YEP this is exactly what i heard from cornwood
[2:09:16] RonJon: Yeah that felt like a "Why would I want to come back to this shithole" kind of comment
[2:09:16] WildWillie419: Hall is the GOAT
[2:09:17] issues_i: and now the guns are unaccounted for
[2:09:18] Laticore: yeah*
[2:09:18] Mic_Stargazer: I was on Johnson's side at first, kind of am because one other officer also "lied" on his report at the altercation but johnson dug ahuuuuge h ole

[2:09:30] tellos0: the saddest part of all this is that he was never actually told to stop, but he woudl not have stopped regardless :(
[2:09:32] Mic_Stargazer: LOL
[2:09:34] chaosproductions: to be fair, did he have access to the MDT at the time?
[2:09:34] Krimson07_: @scritr fr OMEGALAUGHING
[2:09:35] TimmayHS: maybe he wasn't aware.. BUT - that's not a fireable offense.. it's the doubling down. He's a hard headed loudmouth
[2:09:36] Canachos: PepeLaugh
[2:09:38] Th3Ch0: is cornwood getting dapped
[2:09:38] Hellz_69: why not dab instead of fire? isnt this why the dab system is made? not trying to backseat, just curious if i missed something

[2:09:48] Gabilonski: its sad but johnson dug his own grave, as simple as that
[2:09:51] MyDoSe_: Do those guns have serial numbers?
[2:09:52] ForgottenJones: Great Rp tho Clap
[2:09:52] Scrando: Slacks is doing Johnson a favour too, the city is at will employment so he really doesn’t need to continue to justify it
[2:09:58] Krimson07_: @Hellz_69 cuz he was a fucking cadet with like 5 daps???
[2:10:04] Artsii1994: @scritr true he wasnt even a full officer yet he was still just beginning
[2:10:10] Faildude: Hellz_69 they came to the conclusion after the de rolo situation that if someone lie it's a termination
[2:10:11] focustft: @chaosproductions the announcement wasn't tht long ago - he was definitely around
[2:10:12] Th3Ch0: @MyDoSe_ even if they do it would just be to johnson
[2:10:15] Hellz_69: @Krimson07_ lmao didnt know that
[2:10:21] Mic_Stargazer: @Scrando the announcement is weird because it says "It is HEREBY at awill" meaning "from this point on", but the case was before the announcement

[4:51:22] Cyrical: @Cyrical staying on duty for 20 hours is insane
[4:51:22] Mic_Stargazer: Bonnie's RP was really fun
[4:51:25] Artsii1994: @cyrical some people have other priorities and can't put the time is sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. The way it is at times

[4:52:01] seamus_souleater: Did Slacks get a report about Lou Bricant or was he denied before getting to that point @Ssaab ?
[4:52:02] ForgottenJones: Duncaning

[4:52:25] layla109: @Cyrical If ur talking about priority players - I agree but most are streamers who don't have the time to invest in a story it seems. The rest without priority gets stuck in endless queue's.
[4:52:29] GILx87: Oh man, that Penny/Turner ridealong was excellent entertainment
[4:52:34] TheMah1337: nooooo not buck!

[4:53:04] RandomShungiteCD: NOOOO
[4:53:04] Mic_Stargazer: ive seen lots of smaller creators and new RPers getting prio so think the people who see the good RP are padding out the sever in a good way, just needs more time
[4:53:04] magnets_: brock 😭
[4:53:07] Amneamnius: Sadge she's been busy

[5:14:24] Miterex: @wavep987 gotcha, ty
[5:14:25] layla109: @RobialT Cornwood was there but he wasn't handling reports, I think that's why. It was Aziz and Brian.
[5:14:29] theredfrosts: Ruby would be a good Captain. Maybe both her and slacks.

[5:16:34] sourdoughcookies: cornwood and aziz made those jokes while cornwood was doing pushups with aziz on his back, to take it as serious is a little wild
[5:16:36] ShinJiHun: @RobialT his entire point was if cops are going to push serious charges, they should expect the roleplay around it to be serious

[6:39:48] theshaolinpanda: Let them learn
[6:39:48] Doqx42: IRL law would apply in this case. "Note: Each money services business (MSB) is a financial institution. For the regulatory definition of "financial institution," see 31 CFR 1010.100(t) (formerly 31 CFR 103.11(n))."
[6:39:50] lookingfornothinghere: i think it could be interesting considering they are supply the money to the bank

[6:45:46] BabyJoker: @dakota22446 WOAH WATCH YOUR FIRE
[6:46:00] Jayl0cked: You have to understand that Ramees tone comes from 7 years of bringing up the same issues over and voer again and teh same mistakes repeatedly happening in PD

[6:47:04] layla109: @d00b3rr I watch both sides but the cop side is growing on me. It's interesting comparing perspectives

[6:47:53] trebekcansuckit: @yogibv2  That is police work
[6:47:54] emilliefin: @d00b3rr totally necessary i agree, without crime and crims there would be no cops :)
[6:47:57] baaba_g: naah Slacks don't listen to shii hit em with the whole book LUL
[6:47:59] robertsmithjr: @lindsard oh i completely get that i have gone to his channel a couple times and he's usually laughing and having fun with it
[6:48:04] jay2seam: @yogibv2 part of the job (IRL)
[6:48:22] chrisestes: The main thing I don't get about pd is searching victims as standard procedure
[6:48:25] yogibv2: @trebekcansuckit it’s an rp server not the real world
[6:48:31] lindzerd: i like watching both sides to see perspectives. it helps with keeping things neutral and not prop crim/ pro cop only mentality some chatters get

[6:49:04] d00b3rr: @emilliefin ignoring the crim aspect his role as a lawyer when prosecuting and as defense he has been actually very good at pointing out flaws in what they have been doing

[6:51:13] wizardnok: if you know a officer is pushing a wrong charge isn't it unlawful to allow them to still push it?
[6:51:14] spookyghost21: Should be a DAP even if they found guilty for going against a superior

[6:51:25] GlitchyByte: if it's wrong, why is he allowed to proceed?

[6:52:45] lookingfornothinghere: what if he actually manages to argue it well enough Hmmm
[6:52:46] ForgottenJones: Failure is the best teacher
[6:52:51] Firsthandpower: I mean the way he explained that the truck was next to the bank ect. I still don't think it'll stick but idk if his character believes he's right he's gotta face the consequences
[6:52:57] SepheronXI: Way to set things straight for the record Ssaab
[6:52:59] xchita9898: why are cops pushing charges with bad faith though
[6:52:59] cjohno20: DAP
[6:53:01] robertsmithjr: @emilliefin and honestly its k, dundee, there are a couplr more, their all great characters, but can be to much for me at times, thats when i lower the volume and do something else
[6:53:09] Jayl0cked: @hiicks_ you can't compare the two because of old laws that makes mail theft a capital crime. and it's not the same becuase you're not chargingin some with Roberry of a Mail Depot. youre charging someone wtih robbery of mail There is a difference.
[6:53:13] ItsBillz: that financial institution charge if for bank robberies, there was no dispatch call from the bank saying it was robbed
[6:53:22] TewetersonOG: what i miss
[6:53:23] Skyler56: hes not 100% though
[6:53:24] hasbro3210: dap him then they’ll listen

[6:53:34] rubberbreaker: @hiicks_ wrong that's insurable until it makes it into your hands and is in your possession
[6:53:42] xchita9898: not 100 percent on charges is in bad faith no??
[6:53:43] cjohno20: it wasn't a bank robbery. playing word games isn't exactly good faith imo
[6:53:43] nocherlas: i mean aside from the legal case he's going against his captain's suggestion/order/word
[6:53:45] dakota22446: oop
[6:53:46] vasuba: The issue is the divide betwee NP law and real law. Money Trucks are absolutely considered Banks for the sake of robbery in real law

[6:54:11] Coreytries: damn
[6:54:13] bleep1987: as he runs reds lol
[6:54:17] Bhasgreth: @37Sol the charge would make sense if G6 was a subsidiary/company owned by the bank/owned stock in the bank but it's a third party company hired for transferring money securely
[6:54:19] audy: promotion?
[6:54:20] FuZroK: promotion if guilty?

[6:55:02] MisterParry: No shot, ask yourself who's insurance would cover that loss. Gruppe6 never turned the money into the bank, so they were still responsible. That is 100% Gruppe6 money, not the bank
[6:55:02] FinexLive: @theshaolinpanda there's no calling shot, it's facts and law
[6:55:04] theshaolinpanda: You threatened him
[6:55:06] zeldaspirit: @bhasgreth so G6 Is not bank's messengers even if they are 3rd party?
[6:55:06] SumDee_LumDee: chat someone fill me in what happened with maple
[6:55:06] greyjulian: @theshaolinpanda what do you mean?  he’s letting him take it to court

[6:55:12] 007ramis: everything is gonna change if he wins for sure it will make things interesting
[6:55:20] ItsBillz: @zeldaspirit this isnt irl its rp, and that charge was specifically for when banks call dispatch that they are getting robbed
[6:55:26] cloudy_charles: what happened to maple?
[6:55:26] FinexLive: @theshaolinpanda having the back of someone who is wrong?

[6:55:59] robertsmithjr: i think its a good learning experience though, if he truly thinks he can articulate it, let him find out in court he will learn more from that, then just being told no
[6:56:00] guilt_: LMFAO
[6:56:01] layla109: (theory) I think Ramee wants to bring down PD from the inside.

[7:00:42] SolarElysium: Dean got susoended not Cornwood
[7:00:51] KillerKolsch: 4 in 20 mins sheesh
[7:00:54] layla109: Ooh ok
[7:00:55] Bhasgreth: 20 hour stream*
[7:01:01] Hellz_69: still cant belive they did dean like that on february
[7:01:03] jeff_taxtenkey: man, server popping
[7:01:06] RedMakk: ohhh okay thanks @Bhasgreth
[7:01:14] layla109: Yeah Esfand was suffering. 22 hr stream
[7:01:15] theshaolinpanda: @greyjulian its only the wrong charge if you dont convince the judge
[7:01:41] DanLGG: @theshaolinpanda even if he is confident and can get a guilty plea. If a superior tells you to do something you do it.
[7:01:47] LarconReaper: self inflicted 22hr pain xqcHead
[7:01:57] Bhasgreth: Cornwood and Mehdi are pretty wild. They both do long streams all the time.

[7:02:46] grandepike: maybe best articulated as g6 has their own insurance, the bank has their own
[7:02:49] danda1orian: Slacks the cool teacher who takes all the kids to mcdonalds after the field trip and pays for them!!

[7:02:55] BatmansRectum: T3 G6 is pallets tho either way?
[7:03:04] flash9807: u dont even get the cash from those trucks so it would be even harder to push in court
[7:03:07] vasuba: The amount of money doesn't matter for the charge. if you steal 5 dollars froma  bank its the same as stealing 10000
[7:03:07] lordsell: Classic Leo flirting with timmy
[7:03:07] DanLGG: @theshaolinpanda technically yes but that’s for slacks to decide.
[7:03:10] EVOLVng: if the money is intended for the financial institution, and you rob it, does that not mean that you stole from the institution??
[7:03:19] meso4724: @BatmansRectum they didnt have pallets on them

[7:03:38] Velatile: the problem is they have no victim, only 1 person had money and cant articulate who had a weapon in their hand
[7:03:39] scyphh: how do you feel about when the cops say just appeal it later
[7:03:40] scooberdooberty: does slacks know Timothy has a record now lol
[7:03:41] Juanca__MX: @EVOLVng wouldnt the insurance of the transporting company replace the robbed money?
[7:03:41] layla109: @EVOLVng Hmm I wonder about that.
[7:03:43] TheBroStud: @lucnith Hit pitted a car into Johnson and almost killed him, which gave him another DAP point
[7:03:45] Beechie: @EVOLVng If I stab you on your way to work did you get stabbed at work?
[7:03:45] grandepike: @lizardeyes what we smokin today
[7:03:45] Bhasgreth: @EVOLVng G6 aren't employees of the bank, no. They're a service hired by the bank.
[7:03:48] Law524: just here because I love Saab explanations saabH
[7:03:48] xShuugo: @EVOLVng no because it wasn't in the possession of the financial institution.
[7:03:49] GwanStruan: The best part is they didn't even rob anyone getting that irl rp going to jail for crimes you didn't commit
[7:03:49] spit_vulture: @evolvng no its not. The company has still insurance for the lost money
[7:03:55] thatguydancingintheclub: he will win hahaha its ramee he will find a way

[7:03:56] owenrogers10b: @evolvng if I owed you money but someone stole it from me, do they get charged from stealing it from me or from you?
[7:04:06] greyjulian: @theshaolinpanda if he won, it sets a precedent for the PD to just throw charges and see what sticks, slippery slope
[7:04:08] DanLGG: We all know that the financial institution is the bank robbery charge coming soon tm.
[7:04:10] mjtorn: until the money is in the vaults possession, and they break into the vault to steal it, it’s not robbery of a financial. just like robbing someone waiting in line to deposit their money isn’t robbing a bank.
[7:04:11] buddha_hands: they're not a very good security company are they, getting robbed nonsense OMEGALAUGHING
[7:04:14] Hellz_69: lol senior buns employs lining up

[7:04:21] buddha_hands: nonstop rather*
[7:04:22] jbc_inc: Does transfer of ownership happen when the funds get picked up by g6? Isn't it still the banks money?
[7:04:22] zazmania: money is in the vault

[7:04:24] ifti10: You dont lol
[7:04:25] Smartyfool: Neither
[7:04:26] nikulaz_: You don't. That charge is for bank heists
[7:04:27] tolmangamgee: Who's money is it?
[7:04:27] a2th3vi: That charge is prob for a future bank heist from the vault
[7:04:29] Dinkerin: it’s the last sentence, it doesn’t affect the economy
[7:04:29] Raionx21: the g6 is transporting the banks money
[7:04:32] disruptedorder: Does the bank contract out G6?
[7:04:37] scyphh: its petty robbery at best
[7:04:37] BinkyLea: you can’t.. it’s the wrong charge, but they did y even rob that G6 truck
[7:04:37] HeyMeghan: he isn’t. he’s charging robbery. Ramee is a wack job.
[7:04:38] goonena: Its g6 money

[7:04:44] X_CrimsonCardinal_X: its crazy to think cops even tried pushing that at all tbh
[7:04:45] grandepike: robbery during transport is on g6, g6 has their own insurance to cover that
[7:04:46] Takuto819: economy?
[7:04:47] Dustiphir: it's the banks money
[7:04:48] DirtyFernie: don't the funds belong to the bank?
[7:04:49] TheBroStud: G6 is just a Transport company
[7:04:50] vasuba: Money trucks are considered part of the bank under normal laws. Obviously NP is NP but its easy to see why there is the arguement
[7:04:51] flash9807: they didn't even rob the trucks if they had g6 cash and not pallets
[7:04:51] nikulaz_: It's simple robbery
[7:04:51] jazzmaggot: YEP
[7:04:52] cjohno20: it's common sense that the charge is wrong. It's a bank robbery charge
[7:04:53] LarBearTV: would you consider it robbing the bank if they forced them to take it back off the deposit guy?

[7:04:58] 007ramis: if somehow maple wins this court it would be shocking but yea dont think its gonna happen
[7:04:58] bertacharm: I think their argument will be about who owns the money g6 doesn't own it they are transportation it
[7:04:59] Juanca__MX: the bank still gets their money thru insurance
[7:05:00] yo_who_asked: xdd
[7:05:01] uniquewolfine: But g6 to boult has palets no?
[7:05:01] BinkyLea: they didn’t have pallets, and the truck there only carries pallets
[7:05:02] disruptedorder: Who does the money belong to? It belongs to the bank G6 just transports for them
[7:05:04] ayspekd: no money government property
[7:05:05] jazzmaggot: G6 itself dont "lose" money
[7:05:05] nikulaz_: Money is marked as group6 cash
[7:05:07] nathan02ross: yeah there not robbing a bank
[7:05:08] t_maaac: money is gruppe 6 cash for the bank and it being in the bank is “bank cash” @Ssaab
[7:05:08] zzthejimzz: xdd
[7:05:09] krosswynd: yes it’s robbery charge.
[7:05:10] coppazbtw: it should be robbery
[7:05:10] eva813: they didnt even enter the bank either i dont think, or atleast they cant be placed inside the bank so it cant be financial institution
[7:05:10] skeletonmike: gruppe 6 is a security company not a financial institutions

[7:05:20] knowlightnofear: Maple bent a knee to Ramee as you requested Slacks. your getting worked up for nothing
[7:05:20] Mr_Tvi: G6 has costudy of the money at the time.
[7:05:20] BabyJoker: petty robbery is what he wants @Ssaab
[7:05:21] speedpax: people forget this is RP
[7:05:21] jollypnda: the back wasn’t the victim. it’s like if I rob an Amazon truck I would t be charged with every individual that didn’t get their package
[7:05:22] iMoore_: is the money in the G6 money belonging to the bank in the end?
[7:05:22] d00b3rr: he said they had bands of cash not pallets on the phone

[7:05:24] owenrogers10b: throwing shit to see what sticks
[7:05:24] occams_cha1nsaw: the intent was robbing g6 workers and their truck not the vault

[7:05:25] HeyMeghan: he IS hitting them with robbery.
[7:05:26] mistacastro01: @dustiphir it’s the money of the people/company where it was picked up from. If I’m taking a deposit to the bank it’s still my money if I get robbed halfway there

[7:05:33] GwanStruan: Attempted robbery would be the real charge
[7:05:35] talamah: Chatting

[7:05:47] dakota22446: ssaabExplainingWhy saab rn
[7:05:52] flash9807: Wouldn't petty theft be the real charge?
[7:05:52] DirtyFernie: so would a robbery of the vault like in the past fit that charge?
[7:05:53] dawnxero: The argument here is of it's directly from the bank or not for the charge it looks like
[7:05:55] Velatile: main issue on the crim side is the cops on scene literally didnt even get the victims names so there are no witnesses
[7:05:56] krosswynd: its marked g6 cash not bank cash @itsrosellie
[7:05:57] skeletonmike: for example the company Brinks is considered a security company in service to financial institutions
[7:06:01] lizardeyes: saabWave  2 shots of mocha
[7:06:01] X_CrimsonCardinal_X: petty robbery would be the charge

[7:06:10] mila_kiwii: nope
[7:06:10] hasbro3210: it’s like a transport company transporting Lambo, Ferrari to a dealership. if that transport trailer gets robbed on the way to the dealership, it’s the transport company that got robbed, not the dealership
[7:06:10] LegallyStupid_: no
[7:06:11] spit_vulture: The Answer is easy: if they were insurance companies, the g6 insurance would had to replace the money

[7:06:58] Subparcereal: they only witnesses people run out of it. they couldnt tell who had knives or not. Also g6 rolls were found, no pallets.
[7:06:58] GwanStruan: While they were detaining them a truck was robbed though haha
[7:07:00] IsaackEz: @xchita9898 I'm saying its not even "Robbery" its just petty robbery bcz they didn't even rob the truck, they had rolls only

[7:45:14] guilt_: The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee.

[8:04:57] D0nMacedon: @ChaoticSanity nah

[8:05:00] WausIsDead: the crim state in 4.0 xdd

[8:05:00] Coreytries: how do you argue weight tho?
[8:05:01] d00b3rr: but they were at the vault where only pallets are delivered
[8:05:04] xolision: it would be a cool mechanic if cops can unroll the bills for an exact amount @Ssaab .

[8:09:28] Zinecal: the bag says money for bank
[8:09:29] SoullessSleeper: he’s reaching
[8:09:39] Beechie: So by proxy, crims that attack officers are attacking the government therefore terrorism NODDERS
[8:09:40] ItsEdBoi_: Until the money is signed over to the bank its not the banks money
[8:09:43] Ned15: There's a charge for each
[8:09:45] LarconReaper: robbing g6 trucks = robbing bank EZ Clap
[8:09:53] dakota22446: charge THIS
[8:09:53] xchita9898: im robbing a person depositin money in bank,im robbing a bank ny proxy KEKW HOLY
[8:09:54] Rilix: if you pickpocket someone who was gonna put their dollar in the bank, did that person rob the bank?
[8:09:57] rclemon_: Hmmm At first I was with Maple but then I thought about it and im not sure
[8:09:58] royal_24: wouldn't that be like robbing a armored truck?
[8:09:59] jdmunday: this why ramee was saying what he saying lol
[8:10:01] Meanxkitty: He's trying a little to hard.
[8:10:02] FinexLive: @FinexLive the punishment doesn't fit the crime, so no
[8:10:03] d00b3rr: this is bad logic but it is still logic
[8:10:05] Mic_Stargazer: thats worth 1 dap
[8:10:06] ShinJiHun: EZ
[8:10:10] kdub_og: EZ
[8:10:13] Mac_Parts: He would have gotten a promotion!
[8:10:14] SoullessSleeper: there was no transaction between the bank and group 6 so it wasn’t the banks money when it was stolen
[8:10:16] x_Gordo: LUL
[8:10:17] D0nMacedon: @FinexLive don't do the crime if you can't pay the fine

[8:10:23] xchita9898: LOGIC HOLY
[8:10:26] ForgottenJones: GIGACHAD
[8:10:30] vasuba: His argument is based on real laws. Robbing an Armored Truck is federal Bank Robbery charges. Obviously this is nopixel so laws are different
[8:10:30] trixar: by proxy any money eventually ends up at the bank therefore all robberies are financial institution robberies by this logic
[8:10:31] GonBonkin: M
[8:10:33] rascaca_hs: so if you rob a citizen that was about to put money in the bank, then its bank,s money, makes no sense
[8:10:36] iKickMyself: LOL
[8:10:36] JPhilly1205: no shot he was winning that
[8:10:39] hopalong92: @jdmunday exactly
[8:10:39] CountDrax: If they were waiting in the bank, you could charge them for trespassing on government property
[8:10:42] Joebowlr21: guys i dont have cancer and i drink orange juice, hence orange juice prevents cancer EZ
[8:10:47] FinexLive: @FinexLive @D0nMacedon that's not the point
[8:10:48] Zinecal: the bag says bank money so they are robbing bank money
[8:10:49] SXR9: a fucking bank
[8:10:53] WausIsDead: a bank xdd
[8:10:54] Mic_Stargazer: The bank is open for everyone why would it be tresspassing lol
[8:10:58] d00b3rr: @CountDrax only if they had already been trespassed
[8:10:59] aidynnn: Pepega
[8:11:02] btjmga: @Zinecal but they didn't take any bags dumbass
[8:11:03] itsxavierrrrrr: the cash is marked as grupe6 tho
[8:11:04] Hillbilly_Hxck: it says it in the charge
[8:11:05] ShinJiHun: Pepega Clap
[8:11:11] chrisestes: Is the charge he wanted to push for future bank heists maybe
[8:11:13] D0nMacedon: @FinexLive it was a joke, also the fine is 4k
[8:11:15] xchita9898: HOLY dentt
[8:11:28] Mic_Stargazer: its a security company
[8:11:28] Zhesty: sus
[8:11:29] CodeFinest: is he listening
[8:11:31] lookingfornothinghere: atleast he didnt just reach for a charge but actually had a valid argument to try
[8:11:32] puhctek: also why not just bring this up to doj
[8:11:32] Ned15: Nooo
[8:11:32] ItsEdBoi_: hes crazy
[8:11:33] realpossible: if you pull money out the ATM outside a bank and get robbed you dont get charged for bank robbery
[8:11:34] eldiablowed: have they gotten victim statements for this yet?
[8:11:34] Le_Mon_Key: this guy is all pretzeled up
[8:11:35] Nacedos: he is deaf
[8:11:37] deadrise123akahashiramav1: it’s like saying I robbed the truck that had the groceries that was going to restock the store lol doesn’t make sense
[8:11:39] Mic_Stargazer: he's cooked man
[8:11:39] Ned15: It's a security company
[8:11:42] Brewday445: pd is so lost
[8:11:43] S4mwich: why is he stuck on this?
[8:11:48] hopalong92: Maple is not getting the point
[8:11:49] lychee_ah: @S4mwich ego
[8:11:50] robertsmithjr: @rascaca_hs that's different, a citizen depositing money in there account, vs a money truck dropping off cash
[8:11:56] rclemon_: So G6 if just a third party right Hmmm
[8:11:57] vasuba: @realpossible If someone forces you to take money out of the ATM it is considered bank robbery
[8:11:58] FinexLive: the money doesn't belong to the banks, it's the commerces
[8:11:59] tolmangamgee: distinction without a difference
[8:12:03] Canachos: damn they released the lower vault already? OMEGALUL
[8:12:04] Joebowlr21: this is the classic just because you can, doesnt mean you should.... next
[8:12:05] MonsterFuel: LOL
[8:12:05] Meanxkitty: Was maple a cop before too?
[8:12:05] russevfx: before challenging and pressing a bigger charge, investigating the value would be a safer path.
[8:12:05] Ned15: Still a security company
[8:12:06] Mic_Stargazer: Like if we go by GTA "lore" which they have with Merryweather before, G6 is a private security company
[8:12:08] Rilix: money belongs to the business'  that are getting stored in the bank
[8:12:08] realpossible: @vasuba didnt say that
[8:12:10] Zhesty: at least cops don't get commissions on fines anymore
[8:12:10] xchita9898: logic dentt
[8:12:10] SoullessSleeper: it’s insured money
[8:12:13] BigglesVII: WTH lol
[8:12:14] timedoggg: its 60 months and 5400 fine. they going to have to up the payout for crims if they want to apply that charge

[8:12:25] MegaAwesomeMan: the money is still the banks
[8:12:25] ctsblindsniper: Holy... So if you rob a Supermarket and take their money since banks issue money your robbing from a bank... thats his kidna logic
[8:12:30] xMarshVans: @dapyman no
[8:12:31] Mac_Parts: Maple is cooking.
[8:12:34] JC9R_: maple is right
[8:12:36] Ma1ignantBear: Its in the custody of the transporting company, they have liability
[8:12:38] ericalynn21: Maple is one of my favorite cops
[8:12:39] robertsmithjr: but the bank is still out the money
[8:12:44] FinexLive: @MegaAwesomeMan why? it's coming from a store
[8:12:44] Zhesty: all money is gov money
[8:12:45] di_zzzyy: Trying to make a charge stick while that charge OOC is obviously meant for actual bank hits
[8:12:47] D0nMacedon: chat is so split on this LUL
[8:12:52] ericalynn21: Sillbullet is fantastic
[8:12:53] rclemon_: It prob would have been best to send it to a bench trial to get a final answer
[8:12:53] Bhasgreth: @rclemon_ Yes, IRL armored transport services aren't directly employed by banks. So they're not considered financial institutions.
[8:12:54] MrSpiny: makes a point saabHmm

[8:12:58] Spokee93: groupe6 be insured

[8:13:05] ericalynn21: @talamah LUL

[8:59:19] ShadowedSeraphim: Dispatch Simon says with DAPs
[8:59:20] kitakiin: its immersion breaking that people can talk on radio at the same time. I wish I had that irl

[8:59:30] chrisdhouston: They get a different radio tone then the others
[8:59:35] embernocte: Yeah and Dispatch needs to be able to 10-3 folks without fear of repurcussion
[8:59:43] acowboy11: @Ssaab Can do like real Dispatch with call signs and times of departure going to and arrival on scene to document
[8:59:46] EvoxAlien: give dispatch the ability to remove the demerits that get applied to them for their other mistakes. give them more power but in a way that encourages folks to respect and treat them well.

[9:00:28] BillNyeTheRoboRussianSpy: Big dick moonmoon had a dog and borpa was his name-o
[9:00:29] Artsii1994: Dispatch just need to have that cofidence  in knowing that they need to give those 311s so police can get to thise calls.
[9:00:43] ericalynn21: @embernocte hi ember capped2L capped2Gasm
[9:00:55] GlitchyByte: when officers are in action it's hard to imagine dispatch giving more important communication than people on the field though
[9:00:58] Alexqc19: Kappa
[9:01:02] embernocte: @Artsii1994 tbh true, they probably don't get a lot of training, and it takes a long time to build confidence too

[9:01:09] Alexqc19: Just a j cuh OMEGALUL
[9:01:34] buddha_hands: lmao straight under the bus
[9:01:46] DiscretionaI: Dispatch is responsible for flowing the radio traffic. Make dispatch only, channel 1, keep officers sitting on channels 2+ and only go to 1 if they need guidance/info @ssaab
[9:01:51] TedCruzumaki1: maybe if dispatch can help with gps routing responding officers during chases since drivers are trying to mark locations while driving

[9:10:34] buddha_hands: wonder how possible it would be for dispatch to track/log all officer's major actions/locations like scene by scene
[9:11:15] buddha_hands: like (per officer/unit) laundromat, processing, snr buns etc
[9:11:16] Beedle: do you think it would ever return to rule of 4 to reduce processing and scene time/size
[9:11:24] embernocte: @buddha_hands that would be a ridiculous amount of work--- the pacing is SO FAST here (like Nekoda is kinda going over)

[9:13:43] sabrinainthe6ix: zetarkMVP
[9:14:06] dakota22446: saabOwo
[9:14:20] embernocte: @buddha_hands I honestly can't see it being too useful in this type of scenario.  The most useful thing dispatch can do is keep the main channel clear and make sure that people get assigned to cards and moved appropriately to keep things organized.
[9:14:21] Artsii1994: Nekoda is working his ass off to make sure the right laws are in place. Hes been doing an amazing job in this position
[9:14:37] lookingfornothinghere: 911 calls being answered only by dspatch via phone would be fun i for them

[9:14:41] StreamElements: What they said saabThat
[9:15:01] dakota22446: Listening holy
[9:15:23] lookingfornothinghere: Dispatch being able to create calls and move units to an assigned channel would be good
[9:15:38] Artsii1994: Maybe distpatch can answer small calls and police can answer the bigger ones.
[9:15:55] jersey_jesus: Time to open up SDSO Kappa
[9:16:02] FinexLive: OOOO
[9:16:08] dakota22446: Listening
[9:16:17] Artsii1994: Like give them an assigned location. Im just thinking outloud
[9:16:22] FizzDidThis: CallieHop
[9:16:25] TedCruzumaki1: a task i could think of for dispatch is a crime heatmap and they could put up pd live cams in problem areas to catch crime in real time
[9:16:38] embernocte: @Artsii1994 Dispatch taking statements is also great.  Take statements from cold situations where they come into MRPD to report, and then try and FAO the officers associated
[9:16:38] dakota22446: AngelThump
[9:16:46] Ned15: I get Maple's point, they already made it to the destination
[9:16:56] buddha_hands: do 911 voice calls even still exist?
[9:17:15] robertsmithjr: the second says may doesnt it?
[9:17:15] purplepoodle89: @buddha_hands nah
[9:17:20] lookingfornothinghere: I mean just being able to get phonecalls instead of text 911 would be so much RP
[9:17:20] Canachos: I think the effect back then was the bank closed or wasnt able to be robbed until the next tsunami?
[9:17:26] friedstk: The rolls arent the banks until they are in the banks posession imo.
[9:17:29] shanejo127: Lol what if they don't have a pallet on them.  It's so bad imo it's looking for a win and punishment.
[9:17:39] Angel_ofMercy: Storm 5 minutes
[9:17:45] DiscretionaI: Problem with 911 cell calls - What if a dispatch employee isn’t on duty
[9:17:49] corylynv2482: Group 6 is basically like Loomis and Loomis is classified as a bank itself because it distributes and takes the money from big companies and banks, clean the money, and then redistributes it
[9:17:55] dakota22446: saabNote
[9:18:03] adsennin: if it didn’t say group6 cash I would say institution
[9:18:13] robertsmithjr: the robbery alone will disrupt operations
[9:18:17] Cadneetwopointoh: Bills en route to the bank are technically g6's property or the business that they were taken from
[9:18:17] D0nMacedon: that's where you come in nekoda DESKCHAN
[9:18:17] Angel_ofMercy: 911's come in a text format at the moment
[9:18:18] davidayotte: I wish Angel was here for this
[9:18:18] jersey_jesus: Are banks in LS not FDIC insured!? NOOOO
[9:18:34] lookingfornothinghere: @discretionai this mechanic already existed in 3.0 where if there is no dispatch the 911 go back to text only
[9:18:38] shanejo127: Imo it enforce and punish not near protect and serve.
[9:18:55] robertsmithjr: i think the key word there in ths second prong is the word "may"
[9:19:00] D0nMacedon: @shanejo127 obey and survive
[9:19:11] layla109: @lookingfornothinghere I've made that arguement for servers for a while. Everyone reciving one massive text instead having a dispatch or someone to delegate and manage call channels would give them a lot of RP. Dispatching EMS, Police, Tow should be dispatch duties is it not?
[9:19:23] Ned15: I mean once the money made it inside, it's Bank's property
[9:19:27] buddha_hands: @embernocte what if officers just ALWAYS funneled people on scenes to MRPD to give statements to dispatch Hmmm  and then the cops just add the people's names to a report so they know who belongs to what
[9:19:29] paraditto: It's an or statement too
[9:19:31] embernocte: @shanejo127 in gta servers protection is impossible because the criminals will just get outta prison 45 mins later and do the same thing
[9:19:36] lookingfornothinghere: In 3.0 cops could even turn on a mecahnic where they answer 911 calls if no dispatch was around
[9:20:10] embernocte: @buddha_hands nah, if possible you need statements immediately, that would take too much time
[9:20:14] robertsmithjr: all of that stops normal business operations temporarily
[9:20:26] StreamElements: Don't forget to follow the stream if you are enjoying yourself!
[9:20:32] thatguydancingintheclub: you have no cash pallet
[9:20:34] Ned15: To me once you make it inside it's the Banks property and not under G6 protection
[9:20:38] shanejo127: @d0nmacedon  exactly it's just pushing to fuck them and not the what the law was made for.
[9:20:39] Bhasgreth: @Ned15 chain of custody from the bank to transport probably occurs once they grab the bags from the vault to the truck. Perhaps.

[9:20:48] MrJehoe: I feel like this is the same as saying you robbed my house if you robbed me on the street and stole stuff that I normally keep in my house.
[9:20:58] buddha_hands: @embernocte prob true.. and more opportunity to line up stories hmm
[9:21:05] Ned15: @bhasgreth  yeah something like that, I guess you could argue it
[9:21:17] rubberbreaker: They couldn't find victims correct?
[9:21:28] celestedgaf7: aren't the bills labeled as g6?
[9:21:31] chrisestes: Is it possible that law is for future bank heists
[9:21:39] Artsii1994: If money is in a g6 truck then its g6# responsibly to maks sure the moeny gets to bank safety until it becomes the bank’s property
[9:21:44] layla109: Honestly it seems crims get the most out of doing crime and if caught, the cops get punished with doing most work and time behind paperwork while crims wait 11 minutes in jail. *shrug. Pretty unbalanced I think but would jailing crims for longer be the solution?
[9:22:05] rubberbreaker: @chrisestes 100% that is what it is for
[9:22:08] aj42058: @rubberbreaker correct, because the people on that scene didn't get robbed until after the arrests occured
[9:22:18] MrJehoe: I guess it all comes down to if you consider "the bank" as the entity that owns the property or the building itself.
[9:22:27] wavy__________________: in the mattress like Cornwood
[9:22:28] D0nMacedon: @chrisestes it's a law from 3.0 for bank jobs
[9:22:31] Ned15: Yeah but you withdrew the money
[9:22:36] Ned15: It's yours now
[9:22:52] Artsii1994: It could be in a savings or checking account they might take it out of
[9:22:53] Cadneetwopointoh: 0201 est

[10:23:39] YEP46: YEP bush
[10:23:44] wildarrow88: The bush is powerful
[10:23:46] freddyboy420: so g6 drivers are dropping off their crates and picking them up later? maybe they overload, drop off the extras and complete a job? no idea

[10:24:35] Ned15: UM patrol and UC cops walking around
[10:24:40] YEP46: Chief of police should be bobby charles
[10:24:41] wavep987: I think allowing one unmarked vehicle out for 3-4 hrs could be a morale booster.
[10:24:58] beemo_plays: You want to be director of MCU?
[10:25:05] dopest022: you think it could get to that point/level ?
[10:25:12] marizeus: im sure pred will join you
[10:25:12] Nionamot: CATBEDOINGTHELAUNDRY
[10:25:12] WATERMELONFRESH: isn’t that what Brian did with MCU
[10:25:28] Artsii1994: Im,iked when baas and brian dis the investigation arc back in early 3.0 that was alot of fun to watch is just the fun of opening that story and going theough it
[10:25:35] YEP46: Prayge o lord baas, lead pred back to los santos
[10:25:42] khrow: What is he looking at
[10:25:50] skympii: thats what penny wants to investigate stuff solve cases
[10:25:52] GD_Rep: asking for pred PepeLaugh
[10:25:56] shlbainu: what is he investigating rn?
[10:25:59] slumbo_: @YEP46 o lord bring the power back
[10:25:59] shlbainu: or staking out-
[10:26:06] dopest022: beat cops and detectives?
[10:26:07] Artsii1994: @watermelonfresh yea he did alot of the investigation stuff for the mcu
[10:26:08] Rare__Potato: @WATERMELONFRESH Brian wasn't able to do much with MCU since the whole Baas dying and Sanguine and RUST happened
[10:26:16] wildarrow88: He wants to kick balls and take names, but he has short term memory loss
[10:26:28] lookingfornothinghere: I dont think you have the patience to do the stuff brian and mcu was doing end of PD 4.0 the amount of paperwork and cross reference of subpoenas and incidents
[10:26:31] JimmyOppa: FIB
[10:26:31] msdeell: it's good to have a goal
[10:26:32] ScfcTom17: This is legit the same thing we have at some police forces in the uk. FIT - Force investigation Team

[10:26:36] YEP46: mhm no paper
[10:26:38] beemo_plays: So completely separate command?
[10:26:51] YEP46: Paper automatic, more patrol mhm
[10:26:53] dopest022: would you want a DEA department?
[10:26:54] buddha_hands: can't even get enough % of the force actively patrolling for 10% more on top doing something else by design lol
[10:27:04] Ned15: Xice talked about UM patrol as well so you think alike
[10:27:10] Artsii1994: So would it be a different department outside of the poilice like a private investigation unit
[10:27:18] ElizabethAtDawn: makes sense, investigative work is some of my favorite rp personally
[10:27:28] WATERMELONFRESH: People need to fear the unmarked units tbh
[10:27:41] buddha_hands: if the other 90% functioned as it's meant to I'd agree with it being a good idea lol
[10:27:42] Cy72: man, i would love to see actual detectives for once
[10:27:45] Pee_aRe: that would be soo good for Den Zel
[10:27:46] tbdd0601: JUST JOINED WHAT ARE WE LOOKONG FOR?
[10:27:49] Artsii1994: Also down the line get um cars
[10:27:50] dopest022: what number of cops would you need to make it work you think?
[10:27:51] Ned15: Yeah you need the 20 on duty
[10:27:55] wavep987: MCU under Brian created so much tension, from Pigeon to GG to Yaegar. The build up to Sanguine was epic.
[10:28:00] beemo_plays: Respectfully how would this be different to scu or MCU? Genuine question.
[10:28:00] Xellwrath: State Undercover Criminal Control 'The SUCC' KEKW
[10:28:02] MonsterFuel: elper

[10:28:05] TropicalToucan: @dopest022 hes said around 30
[10:28:06] Sl33pyJinn: chat is he saying one more patrol or Omar patrol ?
[10:28:12] the_bucket_plays: need a specialized unit that only does reports for other cops the super pecil squad or whatever
[10:28:17] ajay311: Would undercover cops be a thing In this?
[10:28:17] Artsii1994: Once we get more cops on duty to see if people are intrested in having an actual detective unit
[10:28:21] DiscretionaI: Yeah going undercover as g6 will be great content if it gets robbed
[10:28:25] ScfcTom17: Basically you have response officers who go out and make the initial arrests then the job gets passed to FIT Oli who investigate the case and make further arrests and build the court packages
[10:28:25] sweetyautist: FOOD
[10:28:40] dopest022: if your short handed you could have them help with patrol no?
[10:28:52] Pee_aRe: chat no Meta let him starve LOL
[10:28:54] Drkdream: HUH
[10:28:54] lookingfornothinghere: You would have to be amazing st paperwork and be good st connecting small Details that 90% of pd miss
[10:28:58] SXR9: blud playin fortnite
[10:28:58] buddha_hands: surely that problem will be alleviated before another department starts & draws a huge % of resources Clueless
[10:28:59] YEP46: o7 lost to bush
[10:29:02] Cy72: it would be great, because detectives could arrive on scenes and do all the investigation/paperwork
[10:29:06] LamePuf: do you see a point in PD where you will not be fully involved in hiring process, meaning most of the process is handle by other officers
[10:29:13] shlbainu: what are we staking out?
[10:29:14] beemo_plays: Would such a unit work with patrol?
[10:29:17] Artsii1994: Like i want to see more of undercover work at different buissness establishments
[10:29:27] the_bucket_plays: eating in the bush adds the flavor of nature
[10:29:28] lookingfornothinghere: Thats cap if you gebuinly
[10:29:30] BakinPacman: ideally you want like 2/3-1 ratio for a 6 man group so something between 12-18 patrolling units and the extra on shift have time for things like air1/uc etc
[10:29:53] dopest022: whats the number of cops needed to make it work?
[10:30:04] BakinPacman: yeah its the bare minimum basically
[10:30:16] wavep987: 30 patrol + 10 investigative would be nice.
[10:30:19] Artsii1994: @dopest022 he said around like 20 to 30 cops
[10:30:29] Nickknows: why didnt crim groups get lowered to 6 till pd had better numbers
[10:30:31] ELEGlGGLE: 10% of 100 should be instant not thinking for 10sec OMEGALAUGHING
[10:30:33] dopest022: per shift?
[10:30:36] Nickknows: get lowered to 4 from 6 sorry
[10:30:37] the_bucket_plays: PD doent want more cornwoods that do like 15 hrs a day
[10:30:38] Rare__Potato: mehdiPAUSE
[10:30:40] talamah: Binoculous
[10:30:44] BakinPacman: busted LUL
[10:30:44] Rare__Potato: oop
[10:30:46] the_bucket_plays: idk machines like that are useful
[10:30:50] dopest022: or just one good shift?
[10:30:55] WATERMELONFRESH: i like what Brian did with MCU where he would loop in a couple patrol level officers about certain investigations. Basically involving patrol that want to help detectives
[10:30:55] Artsii1994: CAUGHT
[10:31:01] Ned15: KEKW

[11:55:37] TemporaryEvil: why is it that the safe was closed in your eyes but open for others ssaab same with doors in the game aswell
[11:55:45] Wheez_3D: How come academy is at the airport now?
[11:55:53] theredfrosts: Hey you own the server give yourself AR’s and I forget. little high.
[11:55:55] Luke_So_Good: @TemporaryEvil just a bug
[11:56:06] 1T4G: yeah safe should be open tbh
[11:56:06] m0ok1111: @ZK4i then gloves should work also
[11:56:32] Luke_So_Good: gloves should cover DNA yes
[11:56:43] Luke_So_Good: otherwise its just.. "you're on file, automatically caught"
[11:56:53] ZK4i: @m0ok1111 they have to...incorporate some sort of way to add actual gloves i'd think aside from just outfit gloves imo
[11:56:55] m0ok1111: @Luke_So_Good yep
[11:56:57] talamah: NaM
[11:56:58] mustikkamummo_: But how cctv help if they are full masked ?
[11:57:06] theredfrosts: Taliban!!
[11:57:09] Flex_Source: cars
[11:57:12] ZK4i: @m0ok1111 otherwise everyone will always be gloved up always...
[11:57:17] Flex_Source: @mustikkamummo_ cars and plates
[11:57:22] Artsii1994: @wheez_3d thats were all the acdemys have been held gives them that space and training outside of the city were there is no disruptions
[11:57:36] Luke_So_Good: CCTV would def give the cops a fair advantage though - cctv of car number plates etc
[11:57:38] bcbray: i really liked fingerprints from wildrp where you still had to have a lead who to look at and manually match
[11:57:48] theredfrosts: @mustikkamummo_ It can help just a little.not catch crims always just tip the police in the right direction
[11:58:22] Artsii1994: @mustikkamummo_ it can give the cops rs and have them investigate further on who it could be.
[11:58:35] ZK4i: maybe just going off the way things have been themed or released and the way things work in 4.0 maybe a set of medical gloves..could make you not have DNA on items. sold in hospital only available to DRs or some shit to make them hard to get.
[11:58:36] Artsii1994: Just leaves the breadcrumbs
[11:58:41] 0nre: Lukas is brunette now?
[11:58:58] Jibry: it’s scuffed
[11:58:59] theredfrosts: @artsii1994 exactly
[11:59:05] talamah: just a bug
[11:59:07] talamah: slayyy
[11:59:48] Ned15: Had two cars involved as well LUL
[11:59:55] Ikilledkenny91: Poor cornwood
[11:59:56] Wheez_3D: @artsii1994 don't they normally go to Zancudo Military not the airport
[11:59:57] ZK4i: because the way dressing up works i'd think its insane to go through each and every glove slot item to determine whether its "covered" or not...i mean they can...i just think that'd be more work
[12:00:06] Cadneetwopointoh: L8r y'all good night, finally getting out of work 5 hours late
