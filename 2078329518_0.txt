[0:30:01] MegaKuroki: if it doesn't look right, turn it off
[0:30:15] Xylek: I always turn it on cuz it just caps your frames to your monitor's
[0:30:32] guid0sarducci: when you limit the frame rate, you want vsync on Momo
[0:30:46] Demonlemming: Yeah, it's going fisheyed.

[3:55:08] Dutch_Tuchd: I think it's a great idea, especially if you have it based around the recycling kinda idea so while they can get their item repaired for cheap, also turning in spent items for a small amount of cash would be great instead of people just tossing everything in the trash. And then have a run from there to  the dump for the sanitation job that pays well would be a great additional.
[3:55:14] LandSlideChris: yes we need to see if tinker is okay
