[0:46:44] SsigSsig: amybe it takes a while?
[0:46:55] DeputyRipper: Are you low on storage space?
[0:47:02] Scoobydoo_4: yeah let it sit for a sec
[0:47:02] ikilluFPS: yea you never never know
[0:47:30] DeputyRipper: hmm
[0:47:31] SammySlammerB: 🤞
[0:47:33] SsigSsig: do they have any support forum or anything
[0:47:39] SammySlammerB: yea ever since the new rig
[0:47:48] zippy__0: Mostly it's not the time issue Andy
[0:48:03] Scoobydoo_4: may have to re install it
[0:48:18] RMatch420: screen shot time
[0:48:25] DeputyRipper: Have you tried clearing your cache for redm
[0:48:26] ikilluFPS: it be's that way sometimes
[0:48:38] SammySlammerB: what can be done maybe uninstall and reinstall with a new save file ?
[0:48:44] Sw3RvE_: @AndyMilonakis thanks for the sub
[0:48:47] Scoobydoo_4: only other thing it can be is a corrupted game file
[0:48:48] Ldcoolgirl: !uptime
[0:48:48] BotRixOficial: This stream started 49 min ago.
[0:48:48] StreamElements: 48 mins 54 secs
[0:48:55] Ldcoolgirl: Hi everyone amiloHey
[0:48:58] zippy__0: maybe it's issue in their side andy
[0:49:16] mackattack1611: @scoobydoo_4 bruh are u stupid
[0:49:29] bushburna: Loading
[0:49:37] mackattack1611: it's not the game. it's doing the exact same thing on his new PC as it did on the old one
[0:49:50] KingDaddyBosscat: Yo Andy I got a feeling you’d love Don Quixote. Call the opps Don Quixote. They think they attacking us but they attacking windmills like idiots.
[0:49:56] DeputyRipper: Sometimes you can install something and still have an issue persist because of an error happening in the same place. Clearing your cache could potentially reset that issue so it's like a fresh install.
[0:50:09] SammySlammerB: no it used to work on his old rig I thought the problem started when he got the new rig
[0:50:22] Cyxote: the fist fighting in RedM is way better for sure.  lol
[0:50:25] bushburna: AAAA bongoSMASH
[0:50:48] KingDaddyBosscat: this is red dead music I swear it
[0:50:55] Scoobydoo_4: idk man
[0:51:04] SsigSsig: idk maybe post a screenshot of it in their support forum and see if anyone can help
[0:51:08] SammySlammerB: damn we need a Steve Wozniak up in chat to come and save the day
[0:51:13] SsigSsig: sucks that it doesnt work
[0:51:14] pA_MrSkettyO: could it be the VPN?
[0:51:23] its_superdave: maybe router related? idk
[0:51:30] Scoobydoo_4: could be maybe yeah
[0:51:42] mackattack1611: no and no
[0:51:54] Scoobydoo_4: @mackattack1611 stfu doosh bag
[0:51:56] Ldcoolgirl: @ssigssig hitchHey
[0:51:59] aarontalk: tech support probably eating some dank masala
[0:52:00] Cyxote: mac address from the new PC maybe?
[0:52:03] jimmy216: VPN might help
[0:52:19] DeputyRipper: Maybe the issue is still consistant with the authentication errors you get first. Maybe it's authenticated but it loses that authentication. Maybe try logging out of REDM and steam
[0:52:29] mackattack1611: @scoobydoo_4 and u can't even spell douchebag correct. gtdo here dumbass
[0:52:29] Scoobydoo_4: i would

[0:58:05] SammySlammerB: so is it going to work this time?
[0:58:09] RMatch420: @ledgic1r i was trying to not make it super personal
[0:58:24] DeputyRipper: I feel like it's got to all be connected to that authentication problem. Instead of closing steam if you click on steam in the top left you can click sign out. Maybe try signing out and then back in so it completely resets your authentication instead of putting a pause to it.
[0:58:26] ledgic1r: you did a good job tbh
[0:58:42] SsigSsig: pls work Prayge

If you close Steam then go to the folder in Program File (x86) > Steam > userdata and then delete the folder(s) there in that file, you do not have to reinstall Steam or even relog back into Steam. You’ll be able to start Steam back up and then RedM should fire without an issue."
