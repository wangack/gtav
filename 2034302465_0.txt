[2:49:31] CoOp0012: I want to see all of cg driving these crap cars
[2:49:34] Kobe__Wan__Kenobi: ahahaha
[2:49:43] crazythings22: it needs chrome spinners
[2:49:43] Draggore: so the repairs were scuffed yesterday?
[2:49:45] Kepelii: Tesla lead the #1 cause of accidents last year
[2:49:52] ExessiveGK: because it is a true armor civ truck
[2:49:57] Kepelii: reason i never went with them
[2:50:05] Kobe__Wan__Kenobi: @kepelii this is facts?
[2:50:09] thedrakmer69: @ExessiveGK damn okay
[2:50:10] Kepelii: @Kobe__Wan__Kenobi yea it is
[2:50:23] Beerbuddie: @markeym4rk they could not do a 1/4 race because the trailer was not designed to go over 80 mph. But models showed it would have been similar results
[2:50:36] Kobe__Wan__Kenobi: I’ll be scared with that self driving thing man being behind that I can’t trust
[2:50:38] caressmyrim: did you sign dundee to manager or how did that work out?
[2:50:40] Kepelii: @Kobe__Wan__Kenobi I drive an EV mustang , I never was a fan of tesla too simplistic for me and has too many problems
[2:51:01] itsChaOS25: @Kepelii how long was your wait for the Mach E?
[2:51:07] caressmyrim: did you sign dundee to manager or how did that work out??
[2:51:15] EHKZ107: there is an ATM across from MRPD not that its much closer
[2:51:22] Kobe__Wan__Kenobi: @kepelii that’s fire
[2:51:29] markeym4rk: @Beerbuddie interesting, i just assumed it was more tesla didn't want to see the results of a full 1/4 but makes sense
[2:51:38] Kepelii: @itsChaOS25 when i got mine it was at the dealer but was low stock , so i ended up with the GT in blk
[2:51:39] ExessiveGK: @Kepelii the only real thing that makes tesla stick out is it's locked software
[2:51:40] Sempathyy: @EHKZ107 Yeah there is an atm right across MRPD omE
[2:52:01] Kobe__Wan__Kenobi: can’t go wrong with a all black mustang

[2:52:40] KluBBa86: kick hes car
[2:52:41] KluBBa86: :D
[2:52:57] Kepelii: @Kobe__Wan__Kenobi  a lot of people make EV mistakes when being their first , most of everyone still use a 110V plug to charge it or drive their way to a station which is stupid , I installed at 240V outlet at my house lol
[2:53:05] KluBBa86: ops that was hes car
[2:53:33] itsChaOS25: @Kobe__Wan__Kenobi yeah having a 240 outlet at the house is a gamechanger
[2:53:51] Kobe__Wan__Kenobi: @kepelii man what happens if you can’t find a station miles away?
[2:54:22] paszo: mr pistachio that's a nice one :D
[2:54:31] Beerbuddie: @markeym4rk Yea idk an engineer explained it on X the other day. Either way it's impressive imo. Would have smoked it without the trailer.
[2:54:32] CoOp0012: @Shotz what happened with the raid?
[2:55:05] ExessiveGK: @Kepelii another mistake people do while recharging is wanting 100 percent charge when in reality 80 percent is your topped
[2:55:17] Kepelii: @Kobe__Wan__Kenobi well their building stations all over the nation now , but I have a backup pack using a solar panel to get me to a station god forbid , already drove to FL with it
[2:55:31] Draggore: is Dundee a master mechanic?
[2:55:33] superdave12345: I can’t remember chips twitch??
