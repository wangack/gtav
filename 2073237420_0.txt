[5:30:02] Cosmic: seeing demon slayer new season in cinema soon pogg
[5:30:03] Englandjessss7: Sadge especially when the things she was taught she learned from like the writing reports
[5:30:07] bloominghel: Today has been so strange. It is like we missed a few episodes on the VQ side of the story
[5:30:08] MiskyeXD: bit like Brick

[5:30:13] iikivvi: pogg cosmic
[5:30:14] wujci28072001: PauseChamp Cosmic
[5:30:18] helloSoWoH: candice is a sweetheart pepeLost
[5:30:18] greenmoose: the problem with a plan like that is everyone needs to be on the same page I guess
[5:30:19] unsolicitedsloth: They let OOC info interfere with the roleplay to some extent, which is a shame
[5:30:20] Kroykumzz: nice cosmic pogg
[5:30:22] jummper__: probably be more like that time she handled the hostages in the PD?
[5:30:22] princesspoppy98: i feel they expected candice to know everything
[5:30:23] pewthy: peepoSigh
[5:30:25] rathan_reddy: PausersHype
[5:30:35] Cosmic: New season is like in a month, they always show last 2 ep and first couple episode in cinema now
[5:30:38] Cosmic: pretty wicked
[5:30:38] Spankinator: @Cosmic I thought it was the last season but turned into a movie? demoncatEyes
[5:30:43] infinitemindss: May I ask what happened to Candace mother
[5:30:44] Kohtalon_: especially with everyone coming from different servers, it was an opportunity to set standards
[5:30:48] Safe_Tea_Thirst: it was so obvious she wasn't the same cop as before though with such a different personality ReeferSad
[5:30:53] wujci28072001: wolfaMeow
[5:31:02] wujci28072001: Wilma Defitt OMEGADANCEBUTFAST
[5:31:03] Dan_S__: maybe a new cop character would have been easier for the clueless rp PoroSad
[5:31:04] benkidd: anime at the cinema is the best

[5:31:19] princesspoppy98: wilma and kanye peepoSad

[5:31:42] sentient_pancakes: Dante this is a LONG ass traffic stop
[5:31:48] Dan_S__: yeah
[5:31:51] RGeneral24: I think that is a bad assessment
[5:31:52] Kroykumzz: Sadge
[5:31:53] alphab148: Can she go on a terrorist arc?

[5:32:20] CARLOVVS: press the big red button pogg
[5:32:21] spicermicer: Chatting shoot a cop
[5:32:22] mister_headcrab: sure why not
[5:32:22] Dan_S__: can u spawn missiles
[5:32:26] InspectorBacon: go full Gunner on them
[5:32:35] PartTimeNinja_: @TeaJaySketch its a new server, they should let go of all that
[5:32:38] wujci28072001: leg0sTea
[5:32:40] PartTimeNinja_: should matter
[5:32:44] CursedShaun: Why do people always go to these extremes? WHY its just a suspension
[5:32:44] PartTimeNinja_: shouldnt*
[5:32:47] yamikong: I thought you played in No pixel
[5:32:50] princesspoppy98: candice is the new. gunner
[5:32:52] justone2fm: because its the worst part for most
[5:32:56] RGeneral24: yeah they tend to skip it
[5:32:57] Dan_S__: it isn’t
[5:32:58] greenmoose: I dont think i've ever seen it before tbh LUL
[5:32:58] Kroykumzz: i think most hate the cadet stuff
[5:33:00] wujci28072001: !nopixel
[5:33:00] Fossabot: @wujci28072001 Wolfabelle has had her whitelist from NoPixel removed because she is staff/admin for the new ONX RP server
[5:33:02] bloominghel: Because cadet phase is not nice
[5:33:07] MiskyeXD: majority end up wanting rank
[5:33:13] happydaze86: yeah that’s true, people just assumed it was a bit rather that the actual character
[5:33:17] Dan_S__: no one is crazy enough to want to relive it OMEGALUL
[5:33:20] BorophylI: it doesn't have to suck
[5:33:22] Cosmic: i think i would have if i wasnt wanting to do the hwy stuff
[5:33:31] pewthy: It's just academy if its like that one class Candice stood in on pepeW
[5:33:36] thatgirlkori98: I wonder how different it would be if it was another character though , because it’s seems like some have a hard time separating np Candice with Onx Candice
[5:33:36] wujci28072001: Yeh that's fair Cosmic
[5:33:37] happydaze86: i dont miss sgt candice… sorry
[5:33:38] benb92: didn’t help she was hired as a solo
[5:33:43] biztch_on_grind: LuL
[5:33:46] Arkhxm: This is somethin different
[5:33:48] PartTimeNinja_: it gave candice so much room for development starting from the bottom
[5:33:59] Drummer919: I think cadet only sucks if you're learning OOC. If you already know everything you can basically direct where you want the character to be as a cadet
[5:34:02] BorophylI: yeah it's about stories
[5:34:05] Kroykumzz: YEP
[5:34:06] wujci28072001: I don't miss sgt Candice I only missed her when she went GIGAWOMAN on Angel OMEGADANCEBUTFAST
[5:34:07] Kohtalon_: candice has more of a civ side now, a lot of people don't like that
[5:34:08] madboyfreddy: same the more problems the more fun it is to watch imo
[5:34:12] callingjupiter: i love new young candice Gladge shes so different she really does feel like an alt timeline candice
[5:34:14] Toliver_Cosgrave: wolfaDespair
[5:34:16] happydaze86: the character growth on candice already has been soo fun to watch
[5:34:28] pewthy: Yeah I don't miss old Candice over this Candice at all at all
[5:34:30] Kroykumzz: same, this one is way more fun
[5:34:31] greenmoose: I guess the problem is when you're being giga griefed it means your own story cant flourish
[5:34:34] Drummer919: This candice is much deeper
[5:34:44] Dan_S__: I like them both for diff reasons
[5:34:49] Englandjessss7: its been fun seeing this kinda candice compared to before YesYes
[5:34:54] TeaJaySketch: I didn't even know sgt Candice, big fan of this one tho
[5:34:55] iikivvi: there will always be a bit of me that misses sgt candice, but yknow i miss alot of characters OMEGADANCEBUTFAST
[5:34:57] Thorekh: i miss ping chaser candice but only because i like WICKEDSTEER fast
[5:35:03] Safe_Tea_Thirst: only thing i miss about old Candice is the Air-1 and more WICKED chases, new Candice is far more fun
[5:35:16] wujci28072001: I liked the WICKEDSTEER
[5:35:17] rathan_reddy: thor a pog watcher classic
[5:35:18] Whiry: only thing i dont like is missing the high speed chases in a buffalo
[5:35:20] princesspoppy98: its wierd that this candice has feelings and emotuons where.  old candice was heartless
[5:35:30] Englandjessss7: the GIGAWOMAN coms on the phone with flop and being primary was great to watch
[5:35:40] pewthy: I liked the interviews for pbso and that was all really
[5:35:44] happydaze86: the story on this version of candice has been sooo good. old candice could never have had these arcs
[5:35:45] Thorekh: @rathan_reddy YesYes
[5:35:48] dazzaisreal: yes
[5:35:50] madboyfreddy: YesYes
[5:35:53] Yuna08: NODDERS
[5:35:53] Kroykumzz: 100%
[5:35:56] wujci28072001: Yeh
[5:35:56] thatgirlkori98: it’s all fun rp tho, I’m excited to see Candice go through this probation and stuff. Going to be interesting lol
[5:35:56] OvrGwn: Flaws are fun in RP
[5:35:59] pandaaika: Tbh I liked proper police work but this candice is interesting to watch due to all the drama LUL
[5:36:00] thantoscat: NODDERS
[5:36:03] greenmoose: I dont really miss Sgt Candice but I do miss just regular cop Candice. But I also enjoy the new Candice.
[5:36:06] pewthy: The flaws are what makes the rp
[5:36:06] Shaws: has trav played on onx?
[5:36:10] JohnJKnapp: people liked Baddie Candice I think. this Candice is fun but not a baddie.
[5:36:15] itsTheLastVictor: Yes Shaws
[5:36:19] JohnJKnapp: @shaws briefly
[5:36:34] TheSauceShaman: conflict is what makes stories interesting
[5:36:41] pewthy: She's a baddie just in a different way
[5:36:42] Safe_Tea_Thirst: old heartless would of most likely never had any of the RP new Candice had with all the girlies and stuff
[5:36:47] wujci28072001: The limbo pepeLost
[5:36:51] TeaJaySketch: It's boring if everyone's just being a cop
[5:36:53] happydaze86: yeah the limbo is pain
[5:36:56] Sylar996: young Candice has more options, old Candice didn't really have that
[5:36:57] pewthy: This Candice is way more baddie than np cadet Candice was
[5:36:58] Kroykumzz: i wish more people woul have the mindset like you FeelsWeakMan
[5:37:00] bloominghel: Only Lula can save this week pepeLost
[5:37:01] Shaws: love to see new stuff YesYes
[5:37:02] thatgirlkori98: yeahhh
[5:37:11] benkidd: I do feel like the chance of the DA charges stuff is pretty low though
[5:37:17] soph_b11: while its quiet is there any new candice outfits we can see?
[5:37:19] happydaze86: the fact that candice has a personal and off duty life adds so much
[5:37:21] Yuna08: @bloominghel COPIUMOVERDOSE
[5:37:34] JohnJKnapp: paycheck wagers?
[5:37:39] BorophylI: wolfaSuffering
[5:37:39] JumpZeroOverdrive: i think candice is a sitcom character being treated like a drama character
[5:37:41] Iskalm: also hopkins yeah
[5:37:42] wujci28072001: Hopkings about to peepoStir
[5:37:46] CmdrPain: bianca 2.0
[5:37:48] Drummer919: could he overrule the sherrif?
[5:37:50] Shaws: he will probably forget LULW
[5:37:52] bloominghel: Sheriff is above Hopkins
[5:37:53] duracel79: have you got paycheck yet? will there be anytihng witht he suspended without pay thing?
[5:37:54] pewthy: waiiiiiit
[5:37:56] happydaze86: huh?
[5:37:57] jummper__: how many departments are left that Candice can apply for?
[5:38:05] rathan_reddy: YesYes
[5:38:10] Thorekh: idk the number either
[5:38:13] JumpZeroOverdrive: like if a brooklyn 99 character was on breaking bad instead
[5:38:13] theKirasaurus: Drama and conflict is what makes RP interesting
[5:38:13] rathan_reddy: 3k hmjj
[5:38:13] CARLOVVS: mne neither uuh
[5:38:15] Whiry: 3k
[5:38:16] Kyllah: Some times i dont like all the problems and drama in RP, because i watch RP, to get away from IRL drama and problems... and have fun...
[5:38:17] ExoticPotatoe: I have no fucking clue when you last got it
[5:38:17] wujci28072001: @jummper__ she can apply for grapeseed or dandy

[5:38:35] Safe_Tea_Thirst: i have no clue with the new paychecks
[5:38:36] bloominghel: At least Connie was nice so LSSD is a chance
[5:38:44] cbay8882: Will Harold accept you back?
