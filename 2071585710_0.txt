[0:46:37] kerrymshar: i was told I needed to be in 6 months of pain before they would even check for endo

[0:47:07] kay_bs0919: yep! I live in WV and it’s ridiculous here! my best friend was told after her second birth control baby that she needed to be married to get her tubes tied! her abusive ex went and bought a gun with her debit card at Walmart the day after she filed a restraining order!
[0:47:11] slackerdee: I literally had an ovarian cyst burst and the ER doctor sent me home with a pamphlet on period cramps.

[0:48:55] lorddracnor: it's important
[0:48:56] aideenx98: Honestly its very interesting
[0:48:56] gorksterific: i have a cousin thats about halfway through the year he got for murder.  so cynically its in the range
[0:48:59] AlyDoodles: if you need your tubes tied with no questions asked in the US there is a spreadsheet of doctors that will! My OB is on it and she helped me get a hysterectomy due to endo and a shittily placed IUD. and she made sure my insurance would cover it!
[0:49:01] A_Humble_Wooper: But yeah, sure, feminism isn't necessary because women are treated as equals in every way now.

[0:49:58] AshuraX13: katesYEP Vasectomy is super easy
[0:49:59] thatgirl_bryce: I recently saw a comedian make a joke about a pap smear and she discovered that most of the men in the room didn't know what it was. And she was laughing but turned sober as she realized that these were all voting age men who could affect women's health. The bar is beneath the floor
[0:50:09] A_Humble_Wooper: And it's even worse if the woman is non-white or non-straight. katesDed
[0:50:10] SmiddleRiddle: I had to sign a form stating that I knew my husband was getting a vasectomy. It was wild
[0:50:14] nohlium: a fella getting a vasectomy is "taking one for the team"
[0:50:47] Jorsh029: The bar is so low paleontologists aren't sure it's real

[2:18:56] Thorn104: I thought Road Cap was above Enforcer oh its directly above
[2:19:08] abblepiewit: no, Rue is considered higher rank than Mason @Crafty_Crystal - barely but she is.
[2:19:19] Thorn104: I thought it was Crusade?
[2:19:20] rickbuh: I think Rue is on the same level as Mason just with a title
[2:19:23] itsjustasummerjob: Road Captain is fourth in command in the Raiders

[2:22:40] laxwall11: Oozi might have been just trying to figure out who was talking him. Might have been confused if it was Nancy or not lol
[2:22:50] itsjustasummerjob: Tail Gunner and Enforcer are Senior Roles - but I dont think of their titles as part of the command structure. It's more a responsibility. (There can be multiple of each and they are selected, not elected - I think that's the thing that takes then out of command structure imo)
[2:22:51] doc_sharon: EZ science
[2:23:13] abblepiewit: @itsjustasummerjob ahh - appreciate the info katesFlower

[2:24:14] itsjustasummerjob: they have a certain level of responsibility that allows them to "pull rank" as it were in certain situations, but they should only ever do either as an extension of the wishes of their related command person. (SaA or RC)
[2:24:15] Kthanid: @darkjester316 see if you can DM me, it could just be being silly.  We'll figure out a way.

[3:59:07] VTMonster: huh, that's right
[3:59:08] Insaif: I noticed that the other day. It is easier to hang at the house, especially when you're chaining jobs.
[3:59:09] samflamen: everyone has been saying that about the pier too
[3:59:16] Symbiotic1: yeah agree ashura so many jobs that are available rn
[3:59:18] doc_sharon: yeah it's been nonstop jobs
[3:59:18] NoharTheShark: true...either everyone is constantly working, hanging out at ouch...or people go off and do their own things
[3:59:35] Insaif: NODDERS
[3:59:36] itsjustasummerjob: It’s because Lane just… goes there a few times a day for her self-appointed Me Time lol
[4:00:04] doc_sharon: I went back and clipped where Maxx found the moonshine for those in chat who missed it https://clips.twitch.tv/FancyColorfulAyeayeSwiftRage-P5ZZXkcBuVj28_pD
[4:00:07] VTMonster: Me time means intrusive thoughts
[4:00:15] itsjustasummerjob: To be fair, last week we didn’t have much Chumash time either. We were so fucking busy.
[4:00:17] NoharTheShark: one other factor is less people have cars so it's harder to get up to chumash
[4:00:24] doc_sharon: GLHF! katesLuck
[4:00:27] Insaif: Whaaaa? You mean Maxx would rather work than have to think about emotions and self relfect? katesD KEKW

[4:01:19] doc_sharon: katesLuck katesLuck katesLuck
[4:01:23] itsjustasummerjob: I do think once more people have cars we need to start including Chumash sweeps into our dailies. Checking the pier to see if people are having DMCs, making sure no one is growing weed / moon shining we haven’t approved etc

[4:03:42] laxwall11: Why does he feel like he needs to be behind the person?
[4:03:42] Symbiotic1: its desync too people are in different spots @AziraphalesShop
[4:03:45] itsjustasummerjob: It’s really not. It’s definitely de-sync guys, but it doesn’t mean it’s not infuriating.
[4:03:55] AshuraX13: Half done Clap
[4:03:56] KarnEvil: @AziraphalesShop some of it is desync tho.  a lot of the close calls tom had the other day in maxx's eyes weren't close at all in toms.
[4:04:04] rickbuh: @laxwall11 they were all told to flank, it's how they were trained
[4:04:11] hecktobreakfast: it's not intentional at all. which is why it makes me laugh.
[4:04:21] itsjustasummerjob: It’s obviously not intentional but that’s why we yell in our heads and not IC
[4:04:22] Symbiotic1: NODDERS
[4:04:27] itsjustasummerjob: Sometimes you just need to scream about it
[4:04:38] PacMan419: if you know you have a bubble you drive like you have a bubble
[4:04:49] doc_sharon: Yesyes
[4:05:00] samflamen: It's also hard because the locals warp and are in different spots in their eyes
[4:05:18] doc_sharon: it
[4:05:19] itsjustasummerjob: It’s why I don’t tell people “JUST SOUND AWAKE”
[4:05:21] itsjustasummerjob: like
[4:05:21] Aarek: yeah its desync while trying to be in a position to be able to attack without bopping the pusher
[4:05:32] doc_sharon: its all part of the time cycles KEKW
[4:05:34] AshuraX13: Yep
[4:05:38] Symbiotic1: yeah its rough and its 11 years old on modified servers, it is what it is
[4:06:03] FunkFoo: @doc_sharon OMG, NOT THE TIME CYCLES!! katesGiggle
[4:06:06] AziraphalesShop: HAs the invisible buyer glitch happened again at all? Or have they seemingly fixed that?

[4:06:50] NoharTheShark: that's the ems equivalent of "it's a quiet day"
[4:07:19] doc_sharon: katesLuck
[4:07:26] FunkFoo: @hecktobreakfast I 1000% heard that in my ears without it being said out loud
[4:07:29] doc_sharon: his little "I twipped" KEKW
[4:07:37] AshuraX13: I love Sauce's exclamations katesGiggle
[4:08:31] itsjustasummerjob: One of the desync things that makes me OOC tilted and I just scream at the other person in my head is getting bumped by the door while getting out of the car
[4:08:34] itsjustasummerjob: I lose it
[4:08:47] itsjustasummerjob: It broke my legs once and I wanted to cry I was so angry
[4:08:49] Insaif: katesGiggles I miss the Bee office.
[4:09:06] doc_sharon: katesLuck katesBongo katesLuck

[6:52:53] Insaif: We had a string of missing/incorrect/undelivered orders at one point with Doordash that I threatened to cancel the account to the rep I was talking to. Haven't really had an issue since.

[6:53:29] Insaif: Doordash is pretty good. And even if something gets messed up, they are quick to at least do a partial refund.
[6:53:38] willowfennec: I swapped from UE to DD becuase of delivery issues and their refusal to refund items not delivered or wrong orders
