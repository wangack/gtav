[4:03:07] Ginoveli: alroight
[4:03:12] HeftyNYC: grandpa is goated at getaways
[4:03:23] cristina217: civ gang undefeated
[4:03:28] donbena_: @FiFO915 I heard Angel is also goated driver
[4:03:36] Z3phs: the way the employ that pit rule is so weird. oh he drove over a sidewalk, reckless driving, we can pit :/ not to mention the passengers. They dont quite know if they are innocent so.. should they be allowed to pit? Dunno...
[4:03:40] emrhys95: they gotta fire officer ruth
[4:03:50] FiFO915: Rare Civ gang W
[4:03:52] emrhys95: octavio will always be the goat driver
[4:04:00] Yates2017: NP cops are weird tbh they are so W hungry it not even funny I‚Äôve seen so many people complain about the cops
[4:04:01] RasenRendan: Everyone hates Officer Ruth
[4:04:07] Mr_Tvi: The pit was authorized by a senior or capitan so it's on the higher ups
[4:04:15] Shivie78: @Netric_X if its against the rules than the whole pd will get fired cause its been like this for days now.
[4:04:27] auto_wow: Cops are w hungry but they take so many Ls they just get burnt out
[4:04:30] SkittIeBerry: NuNu got them out of a tight spot for sure
[4:04:36] Netric_X: @Shivie78 Only if it's reported
[4:04:39] Flashthatuuu: It‚Äôs RP. Cops suck IRL too so it‚Äôs only fitting
[4:04:52] emrhys95: chase so intense, it made you pee kekw
[4:04:52] Mr_Tvi: @flashthatuuu LUL
[4:04:56] Villenthessis: FeelsWeirdManW Cop RP haters
[4:04:58] CorveIius: When you run over locals they get aggressive
[4:04:59] Z3phs: another weird thing is, they identify eugene, that has warrant, and they leave him go, and chase an unknown car. to be fair, they should have just stayed put, and say eugene stole it and they didnt know. what were the cops gonna pin on them?
[4:05:01] FiFO915: i thought chases were max 3   pd units?
[4:05:23] Olvi12: cops are do down bad anyways
[4:05:24] emrhys95: you had like 6 cops on you
[4:05:24] Heezmagnif: They're not supposed to pit at high speeds
[4:05:27] joac1144: @FiFO915 nah, the default is 3
[4:05:28] midzito: i mean how else theyre gonna catch
[4:05:29] belllis_: they started pitting pretty quick
[4:05:32] Ginoveli: i mean there is a meta for it but it does make it more exciting
[4:05:34] MrLebowski_: they shouldnt pit at those speeds
[4:05:36] justCoopp: @Acie, i gotta head to work ill be lurking bye brie
[4:05:37] skumskilla: they know
[4:05:39] Z3phs: he already had a warrant
[4:05:42] Z3phs: doesnt matter
[4:05:43] FiFO915: @joac1144 oh
[4:05:45] LazyMike: Jason would
[4:05:47] Mr_Tvi: They can do it if it's safe  and you going under a 100. That car was ass
[4:05:50] torty1987: hate when u guys get in chases my palms get super swetty
[4:05:52] iNKWERK: they prob went on you guys since they knew they couldnt catch eugene @Acie
[4:05:52] marqjumbo: @Z3phs i mean why not, its fun
[4:05:54] emrhys95: they cant ram like that tf lol
[4:05:56] Ginoveli: they sort of have to follow a standard
[4:05:56] goose__bag: @skumskilla they can lol
[4:05:57] joachimthecrab: pull over, f no
[4:06:13] supervan_12: U guys dont know stolen care+lockpick = nunu jailtime
[4:06:13] Tenivir: the car she had is way harder to control than eugenes for example, he got one of the best available atm for actual control
[4:06:14] M0hkofantti: Its under 50 or something to pit
[4:06:15] Mr_Tvi: In the academy I watched it had to be under 100 or something
[4:06:18] Heezmagnif: anything over 80mph is for serious crime
[4:06:26] Ginoveli: yeah if they pit over 90 there is a chance the car explodes etc
[4:06:30] Yates2017: some city‚Äôs don‚Äôt allow pits over 80 or in residential area
[4:06:30] skumskilla: @goose__bag huh
[4:06:39] Ginoveli: mass explosion because of the cars
[4:06:40] m331o: homeless YEP
[4:06:47] Z3phs: @supervan_12 if she wasnt driving in the first place, was eugene how can they say she stole it lol
[4:06:48] DylBKR: In theory pitting at high speeds could kill or cause collateral
[4:06:49] Mr_Tvi: If you're pitting someone at 100 mph plus you're trying to kill them basically
[4:06:58] Tenivir: she in queue still
[4:06:58] 2wicked001: lucky the car you were in was 4 wheeldrive and able to push cop cars
[4:07:13] Ginoveli: server definitely needed it seems like
[4:07:18] Dumi90: @Tenivir clip queue kekew
[4:07:21] AgadhiTheGreat: Yea, they're allowed to pit just under 90 now
[4:07:24] RealWicari: @2wicked001 yeah smokey car and boxed in, thought it was over lol
[4:07:26] venyalorelei: eugene is back in kinda
[4:07:28] Ginoveli: poo c
[4:07:28] joachimthecrab: I thought you got BAND lol
[4:07:28] Z3phs: i mean if you get in a car with a friend and that friend stole it, im pretty sure youre not guilty of anything
[4:07:42] leenseoh: oh, it happened again
[4:07:45] Tenivir: Dumi90 i mean she is watching clips because she in queue not just cuz clips
[4:08:03] Flashthatuuu: Accomplice

[4:08:20] Dumi90: @Tenivir i was watching she started fivem after like 15 clips :D
[4:08:24] joachimthecrab: Gramps was so cool about it
[4:08:27] Ginoveli: basically a bid
[4:08:28] emrhys95: cops snatching defeat at the jaws of victory kekw
[4:08:31] Z3phs: you would never put it on eugene, i get it. but again he already has a warrant today. does it matter 1 more charge?
[4:08:39] jjtheone98: What's up? How's the stream been so far?
[4:08:42] Dumi90: doesnt matter tho Û†ÄÄ
