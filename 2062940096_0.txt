[0:58:15] humful1: adjustments on weekly buy in needed
[0:58:29] Hypnovile: yuno pushing loundromat
[0:58:58] GaiGenX: You need a capital call to get the investment into butcoin.
[0:59:32] SpilledNuts: lang could do do a like interest free "loan" and the 'group' can pay him back
[0:59:41] OriginalGibsta: people still owe Arush and Lang for the first house PepeLaugh
[1:00:00] EyeScraem: tony is still like -30k OMEGALUL
[1:00:05] decoy1666: Yuno did give all the rewards for heist
[1:00:23] EyeScraem: @decoy1666 with that logic everyone who went did
[1:00:25] neowan9: @decoy1666 so did larry, oscar, marty with the ammunation heist
[1:00:30] SekretAznMan: LULW
[1:00:41] decoy1666: yeah thats also true
[1:00:46] sezmarv: KEKW

[1:01:16] sezmarv: They all did for progression
[1:01:18] neowan9: yea but to the eyes of lang, theyre not contibuting anything
[1:01:20] WombatGamingLive: require minimum amount of crew work per week
[1:01:25] EyeScraem: most don't make money LUL

[1:02:25] davidcrt517: the don is in charge of his people
[1:02:26] walsallsteve: Keep more of the dirty money for the crew
[1:02:38] ex_poseidon: yuno doesnt care about money n lots of time he doesnt even register n record the money he make for the crew!
[1:02:39] IrSleepii: @decoy1666 well that was with crew resources
[1:02:40] Hypnovile: bro why yall hating yuno sm
[1:02:47] JustCharnock: but to pay the weekly dues they have to have money to pay for that . plus rentals
[1:02:50] nizzara27: @neowan9 thats weird tho cuz theyre only making all this money in the first place FOR progression so punishing  people that contribute to progression makes no sense
[1:02:56] DuaLipasPoolBoy: @Hypnovile he doesnt bring in any money for the crew
[1:03:00] EyeScraem: @Hypnovile its not hating on yuno its just saying the way it is LUL

[1:03:11] rustico0716: non-crim jobs should be taxed too
[1:03:16] soleb_xx: if you don‚Äôt do illegal things you pay more per week?
[1:03:19] cjcooler12: they produce a Quota
[1:03:19] howdoesit: a cull
[1:03:19] sezmarv: @neowan9 yep his only doing the hacking and getting the "IMPORTANT USB" i dont know for you know "PROGRESSION" what else?
[1:03:37] davidcrt517: yuno working for the future
[1:03:43] decoy1666: @IrSleepii everytime Yuno sold a computer deal it was with the groups resources. whats your point?
[1:03:44] Rhysing: doesn't doubling weekly dues incentive people doing things that bring in money for the crew, to get kickbacks?
[1:03:45] Sircs_: and yuno would give it 100%
[1:03:49] genrol: problem solved
[1:03:49] SpilledNuts: can you make weekly dues higher, and not tax anything. everyone just has to pay x amount?
[1:03:52] sleepyeles: KEKW surelyyyyy
[1:04:07] iiidet: mmh
[1:04:09] emiz0r: ilya is great
[1:04:25] Thadorus: IMO ditch the weekly dues. Increase the crew cut a bit. Make sure people are working.
[1:04:40] howdoesit: a test would be spicy
[1:05:00] Zydonian: @Thadorus if you do that you bring in even less money from members who dont do crim stuff
[1:05:06] Hypnovile: yuno making sale first week for 70k
[1:05:09] EyeScraem: martin seems to be trying NODDERS
[1:05:11] jpgamelabs: Ask 100k from yuno. KEKW
[1:05:18] EyeScraem: @Hypnovile yea but he also got paid back in kickbacks

[1:05:50] iOnlySMOrc: JUICE
[1:05:58] davidcrt517: yuno needs his own computer for heist only crew
[1:06:11] IrSleepii: @IrSleepii yeah and then all the money he made went to the crew. doing the heist all the goods went to the crew. if the payout was 20k divided by 6 people it isnt much
[1:06:25] Sircs_: yuno spam running the laundry ashiNote
[1:07:10] shiifon: 5K is alot LUL
[1:07:11] davidcrt517: marty and his crew can be the gambling division
[1:07:14] howdoesit: splitting heist crew from crime crew would be tricky
[1:07:21] decoy1666: @davidcrt517 yuno is building out his own computer stuff(buttcoin) so that he can take other crews on heists(new groups to give them a new experience)
[1:07:25] TwoBacks: OhMyDog
[1:07:26] fishingfloridawaters: 5k is $50k

[1:09:16] howdoesit: those doing chop/sani/pushing should pay less than those who don't
[1:09:27] chocbrowniee: Marty Larry and Oscar gave them guns, materials, offered to clean money and they still get shit on OMEGALUL
[1:09:44] sqwuack: "offered"
[1:09:49] turbodyrock: Chatting im upset
[1:09:49] craxg7: i feel like oscar and larry has no idea about how the dirty money system works
[1:09:52] WombatGamingLive: what if there is magnets though‚Ä¶.
[1:10:07] chocbrowniee: They gave them 5k materials and straight up got ignored
[1:10:15] decoy1666: Whatever happens. Happens. I just pray something doesnt happen because of "CB COMMS". It should happen cause its real, not cause its misunderstood
[1:10:40] WombatGamingLive: 5k materials is like 20-25k in street cash?
[1:10:52] Xernique: The heists are for the benefit of everyone though. Guns for the whole crew etc

[1:31:57] Nywro: Can they input the same name on more than 1 app?
[1:32:12] obscurewill: why is that not worth it?
[1:32:13] yoogeyes2: 16 fewer customers an hour
[1:32:23] Akizakiz: tbh why does it limit to 12 anyway?
[1:32:23] IrSleepii: why cant heist crew move to a different pc?
[1:32:31] harkolly: New strain time for Teddy
[1:32:42] GrandTreasurerOfHell: It cost butcoin to add members
[1:32:54] Fugeki: only solution would probably be be able to buy crew slots for x amount of buttcoin but that‚Äôs a whole dev problem damn
[1:32:59] GrandTreasurerOfHell: That's why it's not worth it
[1:33:05] rustico0716: Different pc for heist makes more sense no?
[1:33:21] harkolly: Tank scooby dooby on first computer and brand new strain on the dedicated weed pc at cypress
[1:33:45] SpilledNuts: GIGACHAD gigi
[1:33:46] Xernique: Yeah, but Lang thinks having the main crew be on the main PC is very important
[1:33:47] vinimathi1: 24butc is nothing
[1:34:02] Xernique: @harkolly Bro they have pushed like 30-40k bags
[1:34:15] Canahealz: steeling your idea
[1:34:31] gina985: can they put at least one of the growers on the hq app and name the strain?
[1:34:34] Canahealz: lol
[1:34:47] FiniteResources: @Canahealz lol yeah. further optimizing it
[1:35:02] Canahealz: right on
[1:35:19] harkolly: @xernique zaza got to 56% so if they just do a new strain on new pc surely it would work like another crew joining cypress and twice the money ü§î
[1:35:25] seanbball14: Is flash officially part of the group?
[1:35:40] harkolly: One crew multiple strains
[1:36:00] martymagoo78: they must be purchasing ingredients to produce that much then
[1:36:03] gina985: what if they put Harry on both apps
[1:36:12] Xernique: @harkolly Scooby is 3x any other strain in the city. Trying to tank it would take weeks and we'll be far behind other turfs
[1:36:40] shiifon: @martymagoo78 nah Brown seen them down there gathering too
[1:36:40] obscurewill: @seanbball14 nope, just a pusher as far as this crew goes
[1:36:51] MADxBACKWARDS: Langs paranoia about switching the pushers to the other PC really gunna slow down the weed game
[1:36:58] c000ls: Kappa
[1:37:08] Beowulfu: is there a way to get Scooby strain into 2nd computer?
[1:37:19] OriginalGibsta: Need one person brewing average for pushing and the other guys testing recipes until someone finds something better
[1:37:22] harkolly: @xernique multiple strains for the crew then surely they will make good money keep scooby dooby but teddy names a strain the runners push it they make bank like they did with scooby dooby
[1:37:46] dootadoo: harrSip

[1:39:26] Bill_Collector: Demoting Tony and promoting gigi to done with Tony there would be fucking hilarious
[1:39:31] Bill_Collector: Even as a joke
[1:40:12] martymagoo78: at heart point do you get the rep then?
[1:40:12] decoy1666: i wonder when business licenses are gonna come out. gonna be some good rp with those.
[1:40:19] MADxBACKWARDS: problem is they cant really push a second strain on that turf it would take an eternity to build its rep
[1:40:29] MadAceHatter: Shadow Leader  GEGE now not yuno anymo KEKW
[1:40:51] decoy1666: They should have money for a storefront but the sanitation place. then they can actually wash the money into a business  and protect it better

[3:06:55] PaganHeart: @youthedog4 There is some leeway in how things are done. Also things change and not all cities, towns, or states necessarily have the budgets to adapt the newest standards as quickly. So yes, there are differences in local, even if there is a lot of commonality between the locations.
[3:07:18] PaganHeart: There's some variance in how far traffic signal can be from lights, which signal configurations are used and so on
[3:07:50] SpilledNuts: monkaCough

[4:31:58] g0m3rrrr: if you try the same combination 5 times i.e. A, A, A, A, A and you get coarse - you can rule out A. do this for all elements until you get level above coarse and you know it's in the list
[4:32:11] thegavinator3000: If there was a difference of quality if you get one in the right spot it would be very quick to figure out order
[4:32:17] g0m3rrrr: rule in/out until you have your 5 unique
[4:32:26] TastyKudzu: @g0m3rrrr If it's a simple setup like how Meth was back in the day you can do it on 10 cooks total if you do it right.
[4:33:02] g0m3rrrr: it might take 10 cooks to determine your 5 unique ingredients using method above
[4:33:03] SekretAznMan: LULW

[4:33:16] g0m3rrrr: then rest of cooks to randomise, using ingredients you know are not in the list of 5

[4:33:30] EndReigns: @g0m3rrrr he has already done that
[4:33:54] sebbo51: why is everybody thinking these are elements? maybe the recipe just shows the steps of cooking. for example the "Hu" maybe stands for heat up
[4:33:56] TastyKudzu: You can't necessarily rule out an ingredient by doing a cook of all the same thing. It depends on how the system is set up.

[4:34:32] tylynx: sup chat, whats happening?

[4:36:01] thegavinator3000: Wz definitely stands for wowie zowie

[5:34:36] Aumilly: @Nicki_Jessi it was nice to just chill with each other, no phones. Gladge
[5:34:37] g0m3rrrr: you have to work out your '5'. do a row with the same ingredients, if you get coarse, that is not one of your ingredients. ruled out
[5:34:39] mike9904_: Now you gotta figure out which to switch out harrNODDERS
[5:34:52] ThaTurtleMane: stick to magnets /s
[5:34:56] mike9904_: LUL
[5:34:56] Iron_PTMN: @aumilly Sushi on the beach? I‚Äôm so jealous man.
[5:35:03] batexcali: what symbol made it drop - what did you add?
[5:35:14] mrdumpling420: @aumilly lol no phones means I cannot watch Rp.  Lol ugh
[5:35:16] Aumilly: @Iron_PTMN harrNODDERS harrNODDERS we are so full right now
[5:35:17] zer0cool1138: I think 3rd element is correct

[5:36:09] Aumilly: @mrdumpling420 LUL
[5:36:19] batexcali: what did you put in place of the Nd to make it drop quality?
[5:36:20] EnviousNarwhal: it's just like Wordle but with elements KEKW
[5:36:31] quote_me_if_horsen: you prob have all you need in your notes to get the perfect formula
[5:36:57] mCerti: Does changing the order you put the ingredients in? Like Apples then bread then water then corn?
[5:37:03] zer0cool1138: when you flipped it the middle was in the same place still
[5:37:18] CourageTheCowardIy: ingredients order doesn‚Äôt matter
[5:37:19] jayrowzy: seems like the best way to go about it wether making a huge spreadsheet to calculate
[5:37:23] JJqqz: Cant you check the proof aswell?
[5:38:15] batexcali: Harry, you are in a perfect place to improve your recipe significantly
[5:38:19] mike9904_: Change the last 2 harrNODDERS
[5:38:30] shiifon: NODDERS
[5:38:38] CourageTheCowardIy: he can check the proof but it wouldn‚Äôt be sellable afterwords
[5:38:38] zer0cool1138: what was your original average again?
[5:38:56] batexcali: you know one for sure good symbol and a bad one
[5:38:59] g0m3rrrr: if mQ mQ mQ mQ mQ = coarse, then mQ is not one of your ingredients. rinse and repeat until you get "below average" for an ingredient, then you know it's one of yours (but you then need to find the right slot)
[5:39:01] martymagoo78: thought the plan was to change the order of the 5 that gave average to see if that effects
[5:39:32] EnviousNarwhal: only a matter of time before you create the perfect moonshine Evilge
[5:39:33] rizza9999: Would it mean you had an element in the right spot for both of those adverages
[5:39:37] TastyKudzu: Maybe the symbol in the middle slot is really really good? Because it would have been the same forward and backwards.
[5:39:37] mike9904_: blitzerNotes blitzerNotes
[5:39:41] batexcali: put vd in the front next
[5:39:44] Aumilly: yeah no one wants VD NOP
[5:39:46] Tamzim: so did the order matter i just got back?
[5:39:48] yahmobethere: vd is definitely bad :P
[5:39:54] mCerti: monkaHmm what could it be
[5:39:57] LuciferSpirt: if order matters wouldnt that mean the flipped one showed repeating setting?
[5:39:59] zer0cool1138: so hu is correct. I would flip 1 and 2 and flip 3 and 4
[5:40:00] IvyOlive: with the flip was the center the same?
[5:40:02] jayrowzy: yeah does it mean the middle chemicals are in the right spot then?
[5:40:03] Sword_Scream: So you can 100% conclude that VD is useless in spot 55.
[5:40:06] CourageTheCowardIy: maybe a proof check ?
[5:40:09] Sword_Scream: 5*
[5:40:10] batexcali: then if it drops from avg to below you know the current front symbol is good
[5:40:14] mrdumpling420: How is this gonna solve our circuit board crisis.  Lol oh shit forgot I wasn't watching the company üòÖ  just kidding
[5:40:18] Aumilly: making progres though Clap
[5:40:28] Aumilly: NOTED

[5:40:31] mrdumpling420: Hahaha
[5:40:33] iOnlySMOrc: ratNOTED
[5:40:36] mCerti: But order of food and water doesnt matter? Imagine that as well KEKW
[5:40:37] JJqqz: @CourageTheCowardIy Yea ik but he would found out which recipe of the average is better
[5:40:43] marthfool: Harry's Brain from Pinky and the Brain if he broke bad and started making shine
[5:40:55] Sword_Scream: @nate921269 Gigis formula is different. Formulas are personalised
[5:41:17] LuciferSpirt: well if u do all the 5th ones then it will confirm if its bis or not
[5:41:17] Tamzim: Good thinking
[5:41:23] hiddenbullfrog: chat, what is moonshine btw?
[5:41:29] Aumilly: swear i thought you said my name
[5:41:40] mCerti: @hiddenbullfrog Super super strong alcohol
[5:41:44] Aumilly: @hiddenbullfrog pretty much home made spirit/alcohol
[5:41:44] KcsBack: @hiddenbullfrog really strong alcohol
[5:41:55] Tamzim: think you can crack it in 50
[5:41:57] CourageTheCowardIy: moonshine is jet fuel that people like to drink sometimes
[5:42:02] mrdumpling420: @harry I was watching your stream the one weekend growing weed and I was on mushrooms.  The new 4.0 greenery looked Alive lol
[5:42:12] hiddenbullfrog: @Aumilly gotcha. Thank you. i figured it be a some sort of drug
[5:42:16] batexcali: there is a chance that 2 or 3 of the symbols in your avg recipe are good  knowing which those are could be very useful
[5:42:26] Sword_Scream: Ideally you want to lock down one position as a certaincy, and then work from there.  If you 100% know one position, that takes you from 120 options to 24 options (asuming we know all 5 chemicals involved)
[5:42:36] jianc14_: ?'
[5:43:01] mobes7: trial and error
[5:43:13] n8richards: what the highest you have hit?

Don & Treas meet: Arsh on vaca, circuit board game plan, spoke on heist contracts & roles, ways to juice BTC farm to 100/day, Lang curious who is actually wrkn, discssd weekly dues.

[5:45:41] quote_me_if_horsen: yep double might be it
[5:45:56] EnviousNarwhal: do you think there is only one combination that makes perfect moonshine or are there multiple combinations that make perfect moonshine?
[5:46:09] Tamzim: Double up the good ones
[5:46:10] zer0cool1138: when you flipped hu was in the same spot
[5:46:12] guygavin: middle one good then
[5:46:14] UncarvedMatt: Makes me think the one in the middle is in the right spot
[5:46:17] jryan701: that middle slot gotta be right then
[5:46:19] g0m3rrrr: 0 correct spot = coarse, 1 correct = below average etc...
[5:46:36] mrdumpling420: Cute girl gave me a cookie for valentines day at subway lol she must have felt bad for me ordering 1 sub hahhahaha
[5:46:42] jayrowzy: the other thing is how it qualifies what is below/average/above etc, it‚Äôs probably the proof number just above a threshold right

[5:46:48] batexcali: I would do 4 cooks - use the avg recipe except put vd in 1st , then in 2nd, then 3rd, then 4th.  any that drop from avg points to ones to keep
[5:47:08] megamanyvr: I think you‚Äôre on the right path
[5:47:14] bird24287: average is just the range right? like you could have 58 proof and 50proof and both be average tag right?
[5:47:16] Sword_Scream: @g0m3rrrr This is just a theory.   Another theory is that each chemical has a value in each spot.
[5:47:48] Landarokz: I like the numerical theory. Each chemical is a negative, positive or 0 number. Your quality will be based on how close you get to your OWN magic number.
[5:47:51] g0m3rrrr: of course it's a theory :D if you're on the Mastermind train though, makes the most sense
[5:48:01] macheley: anyone know if ha
[5:48:32] mrdumpling420: SI is the most paranoid guy I know in 4.0 haha that's why he Gets arrested lol
[5:48:37] batexcali: @g0m3rrrr yeah I think it's mastermind with bad feedback
[5:48:42] macheley: Harry has tried the penny in a food slot

Nowadays any trip in Africa where you spend some time in nature looking at free-roaming animals can be called a safari. xdaruken

[8:33:19] Auruanix: if you swap chemicals with digits you are just looking for 5 digit pin number that can have duplicates, is the way i look at it, and yours consist of 5 that you got below average with, is my best guess
[8:33:24] gasbrain: @imSyndrine yeah
[8:33:28] zer0cool1138: I know that's why I don't know if second is ND or ql.  2 and 4th are the only unknowns

[8:34:21] chromebright: Harry is so locked in right now.
[8:34:27] zer0cool1138: average
[8:34:38] imSyndrine: if the 5 elements are correct its 5x4x3 x2 which is 120 combos
[8:34:41] AnomanderRake__: @Harry Harry can you please ask Clarissa what novel shes reading? You said u forgot the name.
[8:34:44] DarthRadonis: How many stars did you get for all those moonshine deliveries?

[8:37:58] shuhryan: I have a theory on how to solve it.. but if I'm correct adjusting from the harsh recipe would allow you to pinpoint the correct recipe quicker. Hope I'm wrong harrSuffer
[8:38:04] zer0cool1138: yeah but you changed it around and it went down. I think it didn't change when you flipped it cause hu is the middle

[8:53:13] longboi692030: this thing is fast af
[8:53:20] EndReigns: You have all the below average and average written down?
[8:53:52] zer0cool1138: yes literally perfect should be either Wz, ND, hu, ql, vc or wz ql, hu ND, vc
[8:53:58] imSyndrine: for all we know the higher values are locked behind rep like meth table was

[8:55:33] banabanoids: Pivot table time
[8:55:38] DEagleEye: @auruanix i really dont think so, we have 3 categories below average, harsh, coarse and below average, we then have average, IF average = 3/5 correct, then its safe to assume 5/5 correct would only get you 2 steps above average, not 3 for "perfect"
[8:56:03] Auruanix: @zer0cool1138 cool system from devs if correct
[8:57:01] zer0cool1138: @Auruanix if correct it's the game mastermind
[8:57:11] Zechss_: ohhhhh babbby i loveee your wayyyy
[8:57:14] Zechss_: everrrryyydayyy
[8:57:31] EndReigns: @zer0cool1138 from what I've seen, those look good
[8:58:11] BigBudB: marlos a good hang for this job
[8:58:27] Auruanix: @deagleeye no, there would be only 6 levels of quality not 7, so 0/5, 1/5 and so on up to 5/5
[8:59:15] DEagleEye: @auruanix why would there be 6 levels if "average" has 3 below it? theres gotta be 3 above it
[8:59:45] mechabananas: @Zechss_ I blame you btw
[8:59:55] Zechss_: @mechabananas forrr?
[9:00:08] mechabananas: @Zechss_ the niners losing PepeHands
[9:00:21] imSyndrine: @DEagleEye potentially 012345
[9:00:21] zer0cool1138: I think harsh is an anomaly it's for an error in the cook timing or something with ingredients before they changed the ingredient
[9:00:24] mechabananas: Why you have to root for them PepeHands
[9:00:24] zer0cool1138: mechanic
[9:01:31] DEagleEye: @imsyndrine right be 0 is still a result its bot excluded from the set so 3 being "avg" reasons that thers also a 6 in the set
[9:01:41] zer0cool1138: doing 5 same across Harry got 5 course and 5 below average, combining the below average he got average
[9:01:54] Nightbot: If you have Amazon Prime you can sub to Harry for FREE, just go to https://twitch.amazon.com/prime activate it, come back and subscribe free of charge.
[9:01:55] AnaklusmosDaze: nodd
[9:02:17] DEagleEye: @zer0cool1138 nah gigi got 2 harshes today doing 5 of the same element
[9:02:54] zer0cool1138: How long was her cook?
[9:03:10] DEagleEye: normal timing, she wld go up every 40m to an hr
[9:03:48] imSyndrine: her combo is differnt than harrys this has been established so appealing to geegas cooks is utterly irrelevant my dude
[9:03:50] Auruanix: @deagleeye i wouldn't count 0/5, just looking at 1/5 up to 5/5 with 3/5 being average and 5/5 being perfect
[9:03:51] EndReigns: I think that would mean her final recipe probably has 1 or 2 repeats
[9:04:01] TeaNMuffins: Oi @Zechss_ Wife and I were about to start that new movie of yours "Beekeeper" KEKW
[9:04:54] DEagleEye: @imsyndrine her combo being different is not the same as the ruleset being different though and i only brought it up in reference to zero saying harsh was an "anomaly"
[9:05:12] banabanoids: Notepad++
[9:05:17] imSyndrine: she got an avverage form doing a 5 element harry didnt that means she has aduplicate of that element at least
[9:05:32] obscurewill: Gigi needs to introduce this man to spreadsheets
[9:05:50] DEagleEye: likely but its the same ruleset is the point, meaning 0/5 isnt an anamoly and harsh is a valid result
[9:06:08] zer0cool1138: plus gigia also thinks it's mastermind like I do
[9:06:09] Auruanix: if she got average from a 5 element tham means she has triple of that element
[9:06:15] BlazingSaddleSores: is this math
[9:06:16] wilson060: harrWarry harrWarry
[9:06:33] PapaDasLo: CoolStoryBob right... right

[9:07:56] wilson060: gathering important data either way
[9:08:01] BlazingSaddleSores: will this be on the test NOTED
[9:08:07] obscurewill: could be like wordle? like correct elements wrong slots gives yellow, which can still get you to average
[9:08:09] zer0cool1138: Harry look at your old average cooks you can see where each element was already tried and eliminate them from trying again.
[9:08:12] Auruanix: if you know for sure that 3 elements are in the right slot, just gotta swap the rest 2 and you ger perfect
[9:08:42] zer0cool1138: yeah wordles a but like mastermind
[9:09:32] DEagleEye: with reason, if its harsh, coarse, below avg and avg, reasonable to think it goes above average smooth and something else (unfortunately smooth is good to be the opposite of both harsh and coarse LUL )
[9:09:49] jayrowzy: monkaW

[9:10:48] Auruanix: @deagleeye doesn't not have to be if combinations are 0/5, 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, 4/5 and 5/5, so 6 total
[9:11:14] zer0cool1138: Ql
[9:11:34] zer0cool1138: and vd which was a bad
[9:11:35] lunate87: does moonshine cooking have rep?
[9:11:35] zer0cool1138: element
[9:11:48] TheDawkman: vD
[9:12:10] DEagleEye: @auruanix right but it makes no sense to it to be 6 total when you have 3 below avg with avg being the 4th, if anything it means the last teir is locked behind high proof moonshine or high rep or a diff distillery etc
[9:12:38] zer0cool1138: but you also removed hu from the middle to that below average
[9:12:50] EndReigns: 3rd is 100% locked
[9:13:22] ryan__mize: changing it and it being good could keep it average just a beter average
[9:13:30] wilson060: harrNODDERS
[9:13:54] thegavinator3000: Can you run like BAAAA, ABAAA, AABAA, AAABA, AAAAB
[9:13:57] IvyOlive: it could also be the positioning like having two chemicals next to eachother gives the benefit
[9:14:01] zer0cool1138: when hu in the third slot changed to below average it was because you put vd a bad element in the 5th slot
[9:14:02] jayrowzy: I think a lot of it will only make sense if you take out the certificate and check the proofs
[9:14:05] msdeell: change the water - more water
[9:14:41] Nightbot: PLEASE DO NOT META! Harry can only use information that his character knows in-game. Anything else is meta-gaming and won't be acted upon. If you continuously try to meta you will be timed out, or BANNED.
[9:14:49] Auruanix: zer0cool1138 has it correct i think
[9:14:59] jambag00: yoo harry. youre live when im working Pog
[9:15:31] jardocanthate1: KEKL
[9:15:41] AnaklusmosDaze: Lmao
[9:15:50] thegavinator3000: I think once you have it locked in place then you do the third, fourth and the remainder will be the 5th placement 15 cooks or less
[9:16:35] Nohbob: I hope Harry appreciates Lionel :p, always great to chat on the server.
[9:16:40] Nightbot: Welcome to all you new viewers, if you're enjoying the stream and don't want to miss the next one, please be sure to hit that follow button! Harry will be streaming RP Monday - Friday, come enjoy the content!
[9:16:44] jayrowzy: maybe i'm just used to 3.0 devious devs but thinking it'll be worked out in like less than 50 cooks seems like COPIUM to me
[9:16:50] AnaklusmosDaze: monkaW
[9:17:09] Nightbot: PLEASE DO NOT META! Harry can only use information that his character knows in-game. Anything else is meta-gaming and won't be acted upon. If you continuously try to meta you will be timed out, or BANNED.
[9:17:13] snooplionel: cool name too
[9:17:21] thegavinator3000: I think proofing is a whole other thing tbh
[9:17:28] Auruanix: once you have 3 locked in place, just swap places of the rest 2 of the 5 good element and that's it, don't use any of the 5 bad elements
[9:17:34] Nightbot: If you have Amazon Prime you can sub to Harry for FREE, just go to https://twitch.amazon.com/prime activate it, come back and subscribe free of charge.
[9:17:40] DEagleEye: @jayrowzy well its progression theres still many drugs to come thatll get more complex
[9:17:41] zer0cool1138: using ql wz hu vc ND average, ND vc hu wz ql average, vc hu ND wz ql below average, ql wz hu vc vd below average wz wz hu WV ND below average

[9:18:17] zer0cool1138: you can eliminate all but two remaining possible combinations
[9:19:31] netflixankill_: netflixankill_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! good morning H harrWave harrL thanks for keeping entertained during my commute to work and my evenings lol üòÇ heres to many more months
[9:19:52] DamoDOC: Will you lose lots of stars for doing this job Harry?
[9:20:08] Auruanix: ye so will the right method you can get perfect in less than 25 cooks
[9:20:16] Auruanix: with*
[9:21:11] zer0cool1138: Wz, ND, hu, ql, vc or wz ql, hu ND, vc
[9:21:24] DEagleEye: @damodoc he lost 6 per run yesterday in the pounder prob lose bit more in the packer
[9:21:37] DEagleEye: safe to say sani is donezo
[9:21:59] jayrowzy: it could also be distance to the correct slot Shruge
[9:22:34] samdz31: Do u like the system
[9:22:37] jungbenzo: think of it this way. you get a certain amount of quality for having the correct chems in the recipe. then you get a certain amount of quality on top of that for having them in the correct order
[9:23:00] imSyndrine: jsut be glad it doesnt re seed every tsunami
[9:23:01] wilson060: I have a feeling there's multiple variables each person has specifically correlated to them so figuring out exactly what they are is going to take awhile
[9:24:03] zer0cool1138: I think you're on the right path but focusing on the wrong elements and slots.
[9:24:29] zer0cool1138: lol harrRIP
[9:25:18] imSyndrine: i feel like the organization should have one cook and multiple searchers so you can funnel into one person first
[9:25:18] chichar00n: lmao this truckis moving moving lmao
[9:25:25] JWRS50: I‚Äôm guessing there‚Äôs better quality ingredients that show up eventually
[9:25:26] SergeGray: If you eliminate elements for certain slots it's still good for gamba
[9:25:40] lunate87: marlo on the COPIUM
[9:25:50] zer0cool1138: no mean the ones you're changing those five are right I'm saying your were focusing on ND being in the fifth place was wrong
[9:26:01] jungbenzo: @imSyndrine üíØ
[9:26:05] g0m3rrrr: boys .. i'm telling you. start with eliminating single ingredients. i.e. if combination Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu = HARSH .. then rule it out! :D
[9:26:06] TastyKudzu: Assuming you have the correct 5 elements and there's no duplicates then there's only 120 combinations.
[9:26:07] Stuckness: should hit above avg and 'good' (assuming there are 3 categories above the "average" one, like below) before exhausting all possibilities to perfect, at least
[9:26:10] rollindarock: That's not as stupid as it sounds, maybe the clues are in the city somehow
[9:26:15] wilson060: perfect moonshine will unlock space npc and crafting rocket fuel calling it lulWut
[9:26:16] SergeGray: Ah yes, uranium is what gives absinthe it's signature green color
[9:26:31] mechabananas: KEKW
[9:26:38] Stuckness: also, i wonder if perfect moonshine *is* the poison KEKW
[9:26:47] banabanoids: I like green
[9:27:01] TastyKudzu: @g0m3rrrr That's not necessarily true. It's a decent theory but there are plenty of configurations where an element could be essential to 100% but still give very bad results if used 5 times.
[9:27:26] JaeMendo: seat him?
[9:27:28] g0m3rrrr: maybe. if that is the case then no process will figure it out. unless you take 12 months
[9:27:28] JaeMendo: yeah
[9:27:48] mechabananas: KEKW
[9:27:50] JaeMendo: KEKW
[9:27:50] lunate87: KEKW
[9:27:53] Stuckness: KEKW
[9:28:27] g0m3rrrr: moonshine is perfect chat fodder :D
[9:28:30] yungsamd17: Clueless
[9:28:49] yungsamd17: Dentge ?
[9:28:59] jardocanthate1: Dentge
[9:29:07] EndReigns: Because you swapped 5th with a bad element
[9:29:24] Bobofett: 5th Element was a good movie
[9:29:24] TastyKudzu: I think whoever cracks 100% moonshine first will make a killing. Because there's not real limit on how much you can craft if you have the mats so that person can just craft perfect shine for everyone for a cut of the profit.
[9:29:32] turbodyrock: Dentge
[9:29:43] zer0cool1138: sorry I'm bad at explaining it
[9:29:44] DougStep717: dud cooked
[9:29:48] Bill_Collector: You good bro
[9:29:51] Kortado: buddhaLH buddhaWW buddhaRH MONEY CHECK  buddhaLH buddhaWW buddhaRH
[9:29:51] Stuckness: chat you'll make him crash
[9:29:57] mechabananas: Chatting Dentge
[9:30:15] sophistsofia: you got this bro
[9:30:24] itsyogurlria: Lord Harrington!
[9:31:12] lunate87: wait wasnt si the one who said sandy was hot?
[9:31:13] Ninjizu: could just be people overcooking and next week a better distillery is on the market
[9:31:17] Stuckness: harry do the horn do the horn
[9:31:22] g0m3rrrr: i think chat is overcooking it.     0 correct = "Harsh",     1 correct = "Coarse",     2 correct = "Below Average",     3 correct = "Average",     4 correct = "Good",     5 correct = "Very Good"
[9:31:34] kroknows101: lol Don't follow the BJ XL.... might have to slow down to cool off.
[9:31:46] zer0cool1138: what I'm trying to say is you have all the info you need but you were looking at changing the wrong elements. There's a pattern in your post average cooks that eliminatesall but two possible combinations
[9:32:01] bananawonka: how many stars does Harry made so far?
[9:32:13] zer0cool1138: Wz, ND, hu, ql, vc wz ql, hu ND, vc
[9:32:30] zer0cool1138: Wz, ND, hu, ql, vc or wz ql, hu ND, vc*
[9:32:47] g0m3rrrr: ^ you're missing rC
[9:33:00] RocketNova100: LUL
[9:33:04] mechabananas: Chatting Im Ve Ry Sm aR te
[9:33:07] lunate87: @g0m3rrrr if its like that then all the 5 same symbol for the 10 different symbol wont be 5 coarse and 5 below average
[9:33:38] jungbenzo: yeah that's the problem
[9:33:42] Demeir: rC Cola
[9:33:43] Rool_Gonzalez: rC = really harrCooked2
[9:33:45] despicablewebb: thats the issue with tony, he wants to drift everything KEKW
[9:33:48] Demeir: Only the real ones know.
[9:33:56] jungbenzo: if it worked like mastermind then 5 of them would have made harsh
[9:34:12] FaramirRat: IRL you gotta go through weeks of driving school, have hair follicle tests done for drugs, of course a background check and then you can drive a truck this big.
[9:34:35] mechabananas: @FaramirRat Or you can steal one
[9:34:42] g0m3rrrr: @lunate87 if the theory is correct, 5 of the same ingredient should only result in either Harsh (0) or Coarse (1).. it's just a theory
[9:34:45] Rool_Gonzalez: Exactly
[9:34:54] sophistsofia: @mechabananas  NOPERS
[9:35:02] Oni_mara: KEKW
[9:35:08] SekretAznMan: LULW
[9:35:15] Oni_mara: welp
[9:35:28] mechabananas: @sophistsofia NODDERS
[9:35:36] zer0cool1138: @FaramirRat then drive to sandy and wait six hours for a returnt trip trailer.
[9:35:44] jungbenzo: @g0m3rrrr that was tested though, and the only results were coarse and below avg
[9:35:52] AnaklusmosDaze: honestly 5Head
[9:35:54] Rool_Gonzalez: Do the math on 2 drivers,two seats and one truck,how many combinations Kappa
[9:35:58] yungsamd17: monkaW Trailer
[9:36:08] Demeir: I hate Zed.  League sucks.
[9:36:15] FaramirRat: Drive 10 hours across state then have to help unload the truck
[9:36:21] lunate87: @lunate87 yea but harry got 5 coarse and 5 below average so that theory is already wrong
[9:36:31] despicablewebb: he is 5Head
[9:36:33] wilson060: I reckon if the wordle theory is right you get half points for having the correct element but not in the right slot, so that's why there's an abundance of below average and average
[9:36:38] despicablewebb: MD PogU
[9:36:41] DEagleEye: @demeir git gud?
[9:36:45] despicablewebb: PogTasty
[9:36:54] hyodohabibi: Whoah whos pounder is this chat
[9:36:57] AnaklusmosDaze: VeryPog
[9:37:07] Demeir: @DEagleEye I dont wanna, it hurts me :(
[9:37:07] EndReigns: He narrowed it down based off of the below average cooks as well
[9:37:12] despicablewebb: hyodohabibi this is a packer, its marlo's
[9:37:13] FaramirRat: Be EZ?
[9:37:15] wilson060: so its extra hard to narrow down whcih elements are correct and in the right slot etc
[9:37:41] hyodohabibi: @despicablewebb is a packer? I thought it was a pounder
[9:37:46] Bill_Collector: Watch it be perfect
[9:37:59] DEagleEye: @demeir who were u playing?
[9:37:59] jshwan: classic chatter
[9:38:01] mechabananas: Chatting Trust me my formula is right
[9:38:09] jungbenzo: personally i think you should test the random chatter's theory
[9:38:21] FaramirRat: Can you make a word with abcde?
[9:38:24] Bill_Collector: I'm in the chatters corner on this one as well
[9:38:31] despicablewebb: hyodohabibi no, pounder is the truck with the cargo apart of the truck, packer has a trailer
[9:38:32] yungsamd17: monkaW  Trailer

[9:39:16] EnzikFires: get outta the sauce
[9:39:22] lunate87: i wonder if harry use all the 5 symbol that gives him coarse will he get average

[9:40:43] g0m3rrrr: @Harry share your spreadsheet , chat will fix it SeemsGood
[9:41:00] DEagleEye: the runs all take bout an hour unless you get the optimal contract back to back
[9:41:08] despicablewebb: felt fast asf tbh, couldve been an hour and a half KEKW
[9:41:19] hyodohabibi: Grime make money but it so mind numbing driving for like an hours

[9:42:35] mechabananas: Chatting I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Moonshining, and I've been involved in numerous secret cooks, and I have over 300 confirmed bottles. I am trained in brewing and I'm the top moonshiner in the entire Appalachian mountains. You are nothing to me but just another bar fly.
[9:42:40] marthfool: goodnight all
[9:42:53] FaramirRat: Uhh have you guys tried using All a's or All b's? Seems like the simplest answer

[9:43:15] AU_Sunny: Put the Excel into chatGBT 5Head
[9:43:20] Bill_Collector: Feed that to chatgpt ez
[9:43:30] FrimOnAFrimFram: I think random chatter #106‚Äôs theory is 100% correct
[9:43:31] DEagleEye: @faramirrat first thing they tried
[9:43:33] despicablewebb: GRIME THE SHIT
[9:43:36] g0m3rrrr: recording quality next to combos would be good
[9:43:48] n8richards: Popcorn Sutton was my grandpappi
[9:43:48] obscurewill: even trying to tackle this without a spreadsheet boggles my brain
[9:43:48] despicablewebb: So many people are against it but it is so good KEKW
[9:43:54] FaramirRat: @DEagleEye makes sense, it wasn't on the sheet so wasn't sure.
[9:44:00] zer0cool1138: what I did was used your cooks since getting average to use process of elimination to remove some of those options.
[9:44:39] rpoole89: Yeah
[9:44:41] despicablewebb: You flash banged us
[9:44:44] FaramirRat: Someone has to do it
[9:44:46] wilson060: yes definitely
[9:44:47] despicablewebb: didnt see shit KEKW
[9:44:59] Rool_Gonzalez: Gives system to madness
[9:45:00] wilson060: lots of data to gather
[9:45:06] lunate87: yea
[9:45:07] thegavinator3000: As you get some right it won't be as many.
[9:45:19] rpoole89: Just gotta keep grinding the combinations out
[9:45:20] FaramirRat: Hopefuly u get lucky and figure it out before doing it all though lol
[9:45:48] Czechstasy: does each variable have to be unique? or can a variable be used twice in on recipe
[9:45:50] Rool_Gonzalez: Might get pattern from what's average and the elements in same spot on them
[9:46:00] SergeGray: There's probably a method that can be worked out
[9:46:02] squidgysole349: What's up fam
[9:46:04] DEagleEye: @czechstasy they dont know
[9:46:10] EndReigns: @zer0cool1138 are you going off the assumption 2 in the right spot makes Average? or 3?
[9:46:15] FaramirRat: @Czechstasy its gotta be unique bro, if its not unique the combination amount is insane
[9:46:20] errrrrrL: Is everyone's perfect recipe the same?
[9:46:24] Zmanic: we arent even at hard drugs yet so wonder how thats gonna go

[9:46:55] zer0cool1138: I'm assuming his average is because 1 was in the right spot
[9:47:27] zer0cool1138: well 1 in the right spot and all five correct elements.
[9:47:28] Czechstasy: @FaramirRat does it? just because there are many combinations doesn't mean they all do something different
[9:47:29] Notorious_Chow: Huh
[9:47:30] SergeGray: Noo the enetgy bars
[9:47:32] jayrowzy: marlos calls HUH
[9:47:57] FaramirRat: I dont have all the info aparently, if it tells you which part of it is right on a failed attempt and that stays the same that changes everything
[9:48:04] FaramirRat: makes it much eaiser
[9:48:05] errrrrrL: OMEGALUL
[9:48:12] mechabananas: Littering KEKW
[9:48:13] DEagleEye: tony just ditches it at top speed LUL
[9:48:21] Volt0: does earthwell fuck with frank now?
[9:48:22] zer0cool1138: because he dropped to below average when he used vd in his tsecond cook after average
[9:48:26] AnaklusmosDaze: yea tony ditches that shit going mach 2 LMAO
[9:48:30] errrrrrL: Woulda been funny to see him ditch it while moving
[9:48:40] jungbenzo: @zer0cool1138 you're working off mastermind theory right?
[9:48:47] zer0cool1138: right
[9:48:48] errrrrrL: @AnaklusmosDaze lmao i gotta find a clip
[9:49:19] AnaklusmosDaze: xdd
[9:49:26] xscoxevox: Hows the moonshine testing going?
[9:49:26] DEagleEye: @errrrrrl if nobody uses a packer topspeed ditch in a cop chase in 4.0 im gonna be very disappointed, put it that way
[9:49:30] jungbenzo: @zer0cool1138 my issue with that is: why didn't any of the 10 5x tests make harsh shine?
[9:49:40] DEagleEye: that thing wld take out multiple cars
[9:50:31] Oni_mara: classic
[9:50:32] Stuckness: donoWall

[9:51:13] AnaklusmosDaze: KEKW
[9:51:38] jungbenzo: but if it works like mastermind, 5 of the chems don't belong at all, and would add zero quality
[9:51:40] errrrrrL: @DEagleEye monkaW that would be sick!
[9:52:02] FaramirRat: thats when u get robbed
[9:52:05] FaramirRat: caught slippin
[9:53:23] thegavinator3000: Maybe there's a reverse recipe with the 5 bad ingredients SeemsGood
[9:53:26] zer0cool1138: @jungbenzo Its my biggest confusion I assumed there's another factor for harsh as a failed cook
[9:53:40] jungbenzo: could be yeah
[9:53:44] Czechstasy: @jungbenzo thats if they behave independent of on another, but it would be more like chemistry if the result depended on the interactions with each other
[9:53:49] SergeGray: Might be able to get into it easier though
[9:54:07] jungbenzo: @Czechstasy yeah that'd take ages to solve lmao
[9:54:11] obscurewill: maybe it's just on a 7 point scale guys
[9:55:11] obscurewill: Average = C = 70-80% correct

[9:55:55] FaramirRat: @jayrowzy inflations a bitch
[9:56:26] zer0cool1138: he mixed in a bad element on his second after average cook and got below average but I believe its because he had two in the correct spot
[9:57:17] lunate87: cousin
[9:57:17] xefeezy: could be that each person has their own unique cook

[10:09:17] zer0cool1138: no because it's all correct elements but not correct slots. His first average was lucky to get hu in first spot

[10:36:15] No_Sneezing: wouldnt it be best to combine ur combination with gigi n luci?
[10:36:16] MrVlume: what if it's all just random what u get, no matter what u put
[10:36:48] zer0cool1138: @MrVlume that would be evil lol
[10:37:15] mero_vi: @harry do you feel like the more you do it the better the moonshine is ?
[10:37:18] xprnstr_twitch: so with the money from arush 40k, the loan paybacks 25k? u guys have 65k to juice up the farm. wouldn‚Äôt it be wise to bring in stevie and flesh? more crew money to juice it up
[10:37:55] wilson060: yes, but they could have it set up
[10:38:01] MrVlume: did u try the same recipe twice with the same outcome harry?
[10:38:03] modyobwoc: ye 100,000
[10:38:05] lunate87: yea 10 to the power of 10
[10:38:06] wilson060: to where like 2 percent are really good
[10:38:06] Conz3D: yep 10^5 is 100,000
[10:38:09] modyobwoc: 10*10*10*10*10
[10:38:11] lunate87: power of 5
[10:38:16] MarginallyNoted: I thought they had 4 distilleries in that spot, Harry‚Äôs 2 & Luciano‚Äôs 2. It‚Äôs different now, no?
[10:38:20] g0m3rrrr: if no duplicates aree allowed its 10*9*8*7*6 = 30,240
[10:38:23] joel_alex: why are you so Harry?
[10:38:54] jayrowzy: @MarginallyNoted 1 disappeared, they don't know how or why
[10:38:55] zer0cool1138: I think repetitions are allowed and Marlo has a repetition..
[10:38:58] lunate87: but if the cooking mats matters wont it be even higher
[10:39:23] g0m3rrrr: unless devs are sadistic, it has to be no duplicates allowed, specific slot for a single ingredient
[10:39:29] MarginallyNoted: @jayrowzy Ah okay, thx!
[10:39:30] thegavinator3000: Same dev as old meth I heard. He wouldn't do just random ya know?
[10:40:01] zer0cool1138: cooks mats doesn't matter cause they hardlocked the mats cause people put in random Snr bums food
[10:40:10] Gureet0: etanol is C‚ÇÇH‚ÇÜO , dunno if it could help
[10:41:05] wilson060: I‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs a possibility that each quality just has a certain chance of happening
[10:41:15] zer0cool1138: @Gureet0 It doesn't help only cause each players has their own random cook which would be impossible to use real science for
[10:41:35] Gureet0: gotcha
[10:41:37] lunate87: does the number of cooking mats matter?
[10:41:43] wilson060: like 40 percent of all combos are below average etc
[10:41:46] jayrowzy: if there aws only 252 possibilites, with a bit of luck and a method you could figure it out in a week easy
[10:42:06] zer0cool1138: I think order matters because they need that many combinations to cover every player on the server
[10:42:24] mero_vi: has anyone that you know of made any moonshine above average
[10:42:30] Notorious_Chow: I wonder if theres a hidden rep like you have to do x amount of average level cooks to advance
[10:42:50] Snever: stream is so quiet without music
[10:43:06] wilson060: couldn‚Äôt grow the best weed without the right stuff so maybe shine will be sinilar
[10:43:09] wilson060: similar
[10:43:37] mero_vi: @wilson060 you mean like advanced stuff
[10:43:55] wilson060: yeah
[10:44:05] mero_vi: true
[10:44:10] Auruanix: @zer0cool1138 yes, order definitely matters, otherwise it doesn't make sense
[10:44:20] Gureet0: stupid question but harry tried regular fruits and clean water?
[10:44:36] zer0cool1138: there might also be a better still to buy to make larger batches
[10:45:01] zer0cool1138: @Gureet0 That was patched out day 2
[10:45:45] Stuckness: yep Kappa
[10:46:22] jayrowzy: didn't skim off the top NOOOO
[10:46:28] RagingSantas: ok look it was 19k on the dot Kappa
[10:46:35] TheWitchAtWoolworths: hookin up bb drug lords
[10:46:36] Gureet0: it seems just a bit weird to have  ten thousands combinations and no real clue behind the receipe no?

[10:46:56] zer0cool1138: he skimmed last time atleast
[10:47:15] thyL: @Harry dunno if Brown could even afford it right now, but are there battery upgrades for EVs on the server?
[10:47:28] quote_me_if_horsen: why marlo gets average with 5 of the same then?
[10:47:52] zer0cool1138: I assume marlo's recipe has two of the element in it
[10:47:58] Stuckness: chat remember it could be that many permutations to get "THE recipe" but you get clues along the way as the product improves, hence the avg / below avg / etc, so you probably won't need to blindly exhaust them all, you can do it smart
[10:48:46] lunate87: imagine all the coarse chemicals give u average
[10:48:48] zer0cool1138: yeah if my guess is right I got Harry's recipe after 14 cooks
[10:48:53] MrVlume: it's personal recipe, so it could be right?
[10:48:59] Auruanix: duplicates are definitely possible
[10:49:03] g0m3rrrr: it's still 30K options
[10:49:23] thyL: what if the elements have to be in a specific slot? ND on 1st is shit but with the same other elemens on 3rd it's good?
[10:49:33] obscurewill: what if there's good and bad recipes for each proof, and by not checking proof, the testing is meaningless
[10:49:46] zer0cool1138: the double wz average was because one wz and hu was in the correct spots
[10:50:06] RagingSantas: @zer0cool1138 that's a big assumption LUL
[10:50:09] F3n1xBG: If you have multiple avarages, isn't it logical the better one will be a combination of the averages?
[10:50:29] CyanMig: @zer0cool1138 if this theory is correct then its like wordle, which is funny
[10:51:02] zer0cool1138: @RagingSantas Yes it's assuming it's like mastermind but if it's mastermind then it's just logic
[10:51:45] RagingSantas: what if there's more grades that you haven;t seen yet?
[10:51:47] thegavinator3000: And if you have 4 then you have 5
[10:51:58] jayrowzy: well you don't know what makes the difference between average and below average without opening the crate right
[10:52:08] Auruanix: most likely yes
[10:52:17] quote_me_if_horsen: maybe one of the chemicals is the strong one and you need it duplicated?
[10:52:47] thyL: that sounds solid
[10:52:53] itsaxec: that's my theory too
[10:53:15] civlaz: have u seen good quality so far? or its just storys from the first day?
[10:53:20] zer0cool1138: drum roll
[10:53:26] RagingSantas: that's only if it's not a double symbol
[10:53:27] adama214: have u tried mixing the other five to what you get?
[10:53:28] thyL: you don't really get an indicator when the shine is brewed, right? like there's no small text popping up saying "man that WZ and ND worked well in this"?
[10:53:38] adama214: see
[10:53:55] lucari10: what if it isn't that there is one thing that increases quality in each slot, but rather that things have a score, let's say from 1-10, and the point total says the final quality, so you can have smaller improvements as well
[10:54:19] absoluteblank: what happen to sleeping ?
[10:54:35] thyL: you reminded me to do my daily wordles NODDERS
[10:54:38] Stuckness: harrRat
[10:54:57] CyanMig: yeah, if the wordle theory is correct, the quality of harsh, below average, is like just a granular representation of how many yellow and green letters you got
[10:55:03] MrVlume: r u sure it ingredience r correct, amount and order?
[10:55:33] MrVlume: not the chems
[10:55:40] F3n1xBG: It will be faster only if you get the logic with the first set of experimenta
[10:55:57] MrVlume: just make a good one
[10:55:57] xscoxevox: Any good results today?
[10:55:58] modyobwoc: is there an even number of xX and Xx chemicals? Maybe each player only has to work with 5 of them, either capitals first or capitals second. Still over 3k combos though
[10:57:21] zer0cool1138: ingredients may have mattered but the devs had to hard lock them because people added random stuff like burgers and fries. So they don't matter now except as a cost
[10:58:37] zer0cool1138: @modyobwoc there were ten. He ran 10 cooks of 5 of the same element. 5 were coarse 5 were below average. He combined the below average elements to get average
[10:58:42] lyzan42: lyzan42 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months! harrLIME harrLIME harrRat harrLIME harrLIME
[10:59:31] modyobwoc: @zer0cool1138 oh that's cool progress. Presumably still a mix of elements?
[11:00:06] zer0cool1138: yeah a mix of the five. Now it's assumed he just needs to put them in the correct order
