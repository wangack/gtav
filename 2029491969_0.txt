[0:56:35] TheMagePie: More success is an interesting take, I could see it working as same result for less time online, but I'm not sure about more success. I also think you would need to establish a userbase from persistent/frequent streams first to be able to transition to the more event based style. But thatt's just my thought

[1:01:14] TheMagePie: As someone who certainly doesn't have a very extensive knowledge about the Vtuber scene, I'm curious if there are any successful male Vtubers, or is it almost exclusively women? (for English speaking streams)
[1:01:18] spamd0wn: oh shit old background pogg
[1:01:19] interiorcastle: LUL

[1:01:29] softballdemon1650: yes
[1:01:30] anthonyderschwarz: What does it say?
[1:01:30] interiorcastle: it just means a non-english language streamer
[1:01:31] IHateDecafToo: I could very much be wrong
[1:01:32] MasqueradeVT: Probably not?
[1:01:37] Zamy_xx: idk rainhoeShrug
[1:01:39] Fvshi7: the wording is very confusing on this one
[1:01:42] Grayfox_N7: International bruh
[1:01:44] Dean09_05: That's what I thought
[1:01:49] Lustful_Bald: Looks like an "and/or" situation to me.
[1:01:49] ShamanZA82: i read it wrong
[1:01:55] 65Terbium: I saw every single streamer confused by this one.
[1:01:55] DarthRadonis: Yep
[1:01:56] azfreezee: Yeah probably
[1:01:58] PvtJet: Overseas english speakers is how i read it
[1:01:59] Tapeman83: @themagepie check out K9Kuro from VShojo, he’s pretty good
[1:02:01] captainfwiffo: That would be a weird category
[1:02:01] alex_wukar: well it says or
[1:02:05] NickPenrhyn: An issue of over-wording it
[1:02:05] interiorcastle: speaking english to Finns
[1:02:08] jcara514: question hurts my brain
[1:02:08] SkadenAnimos: Europeans be like huhh

[1:02:10] Angel_wings03: geegaB hey guys
[1:02:11] azfreezee: It's worded a bit odd I suppose
[1:02:11] its_stephannie: That's how I took it, non english speaking audience
[1:02:11] MrByte: I dunno, there's a lot of Euroids and Britoids here who speak non-North American English
[1:02:12] garethbracchi: it’s very badly worded
[1:02:15] leshnator: It could be language is not the focus? Rather the content itself.
[1:02:16] Grayfox_N7: yup
[1:02:17] 와사비해삼: wakGt
[1:02:17] AllanRayy: I read it as someone who doesn't exclusively speaks english
[1:02:17] imobaka: idk anymore KEKW
[1:02:18] CaelumVulk: The wording definitely causes some confusion
[1:02:19] OwlOfAvery: Yeah, I think it's a category to be inclusive of non-English streamers
[1:02:22] Ergovision: @TheMagePie There are several. Vox Akuma, shoto, Porcelain maid and k9kuro come to mind
[1:02:22] Mikecheal: @themagepie Shxtou, Vox, LordAethelstan, etc.
[1:02:23] dragadoon: !discord
[1:02:23] Nightbot: discord.gg/geega Pick a faction and join the Mob Army!
[1:02:23] IHateDecafToo: That's fine, I was confused by the wording and really uncertain.
[1:02:25] Jakxtra: i read it as international english or not
[1:02:25] Lutre: yeah the wording is unclear
[1:02:26] anthonyderschwarz: Yeah Cellbit
[1:02:27] stinkypoopypoopoo: it mean they could speak a diff language it just mean non american
[1:02:32] MikeFre928: Gosegu
[1:02:33] Comrade_Otaku_: HYPERHEADBANG
[1:02:34] CandL2023: It's a pretty bad category, so many people just can't vote on this one
[1:02:34] GrayOfSloth: It's the Euro category
[1:02:34] imobaka: Limmy would fit

[1:03:08] interiorcastle: @TheMagePie also Nijisanji has quite a few big guytubers
[1:03:15] RosalieRedd: Froot speaks non-North American English *laughs at the wording*

[1:03:22] Bird_toe: As a member of the North American English speaking audience, I felt I should skip that nomination.
[1:03:24] CosmicCarlVT: Henya hard clear
[1:03:26] spamd0wn: @cocoa31415 it’s one of the lingua francas, but not unique

[1:03:28] ShamanZA82: CEASE henya
