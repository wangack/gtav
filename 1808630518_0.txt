[0:45:18] Surfer619SD: are you doing any IRL travel streams coming up this year?
[0:45:19] BootCrow: Are there other jobs that pay better? Or is this kinda the one to do
[0:46:00] vipslampy15: Plus for you as a streamer a little chill after being so socially and vocally active is nice. You talk for 5 hours non stop its nice to just relax.
[0:46:01] Derp_Gravy: Lewd is pretty good at it, but it can definitely take her mind off the RP when talking to chat off and on so much. Easy to lose train of thought talking to someone
[0:46:27] prodxCrash: are u muted?
