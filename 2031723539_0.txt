[0:38:36] Jonnykiller354: @happy_questionmark if you can think it it has happen in a different universe
[0:40:06] happy_questionmark: what if i think there's a universe that made contact with our universe?
[0:40:26] happy_questionmark: and so
[0:41:01] QuesoCommander: infinite universes doesn't necessarily mean all possibilities though
[0:41:20] jimothy64: @happy_questionmark well, in an infinite number of universes that has happened, but there are also an infinite number of universes where it hasn't happened. Multiverse theory accepts paradoxes as just.. part and parcel
[0:41:45] QuesoCommander: or rather it does mean all possibilities, but it doesn't mean *anything* can happen - only what is possible by what laws of physics exist
[0:42:17] nobodybodon: also, determinism if true means that even in a multiverse scenario, they would all be identical which is way weirder nodd
[0:42:44] Verycelery: huh, i've never heard that one before
[0:42:47] nobodybodon: TLDR: if the laws of physics and math are the same, everything would happen in the exact same way. all apparent randomness is errors in our measuring and calculating

[2:55:29] U62charlie: people to easily blur lines
[2:55:43] blackpilIed: it‚Äôs all fun and games until they slide you a message on ‚Äúemail‚Äù
[2:55:46] jimothy64: Aye an extra degree of separation doesn't hurt
[2:56:25] happy_questionmark: is it common for a relation to start out as rp and turns into a real relationship irl?
[2:56:42] jimothy64: @happy_questionmark definitely happens
[2:56:44] Auhreliam: @happy_questionmark it happens but it doesnt last

[2:59:27] Auhreliam: two things are infinite in this world: The amount of Zubats in a dark cave, and the amount of stupidity that is about
[2:59:30] AshesFade: Damn she kinda really good at drawing

[3:03:09] ApocAFK: I've definitely mourned for fictional (book/movie) characters more that I should before
[3:03:13] JoeayIV: yea she had to remind her body she wasn't an alcoholic
[3:03:20] joxthejoker: Yea I was watching some of your old vods from 3.0 and I had to stop watching them because Tessa was so depressed it was seriously messing with me
[3:03:31] blackpilIed: 100% there‚Äôs gotta be psychology
[3:03:34] jimothy64: Brains are the dumbest smart things. Capable of amazing feats of acting, incapable of realising its acting sometimes.
[3:03:37] WasnThelag: Multiple personalities
[3:03:39] KKumare: youre totally right, im not RPing, but having deep RP can be as real as reality.
[3:03:58] happy_questionmark: i'm guessing it can be therapeutic as well
[3:04:16] happy_questionmark: that duck is ducking awesome
[3:04:18] vipersummer: RP is like method acting at times, it can activate things in your brain confuse things. You tap into emotions for certain things and it can throw you off if you cant turn it off after
[3:04:18] jaymo_0: yeah it was sad from a viewer standpoint so i could imagine being in character it would do something
[3:04:29] KKumare: Our brain works very strange. You can force yourself to smile and you will feel better.
[3:04:45] CatGotYourKeyboard: nakkiAw

[3:05:54] MintJoint: and that's that
[3:06:00] QuesoCommander: one day, they'll switch to ranked voting Prayge
[3:06:54] happy_questionmark: i don't know how true it is but i've heard that our subconscious minds don't get sarcasm and how something like sarcasm can be damaging
[3:07:28] nobodybodon: I would NEVER be sarcastic
[3:07:29] JoeayIV: shes crooked
[3:07:51] JoeayIV: FRICK THE PRESS

[3:09:29] QuesoCommander: makes it better tbh
[3:09:29] TinIsARobot: you should 100% just make up rules.
[3:09:32] kettchup: that'll just make it funnier
[3:09:35] 80sHairMetalFan: It'll be fine
[3:09:37] joxthejoker: That makes it so much better
[3:09:41] JoeayIV: maybe just keep score and hand out penalties randomly
[3:09:59] wuitness: Its european or american football?
[3:10:03] Rekonin: Make calls that come from other games, like "15-love!"
[3:10:11] nobodybodon: yeah, everyone hates and disagrees with the ref anyways
[3:10:11] joxthejoker: Penalize swearing and other random things
[3:10:12] KeohLive: would probably make sense to have house rules since GTA isnt exactly a football game lol
[3:10:15] QuesoCommander: new rule: penalties incur one compliment to the victim
[3:10:17] Chiracho: italian american footbal * Kappa
[3:10:17] blackpilIed: step 1: completely rig it LUL
[3:10:36] vipersummer: new rule, if you want to overturn a call its 100 dollars
[3:10:41] kiriel09: Hustle them for money to make the calls go their way lol
[3:10:54] happy_questionmark: did tessa draw the duck with a knife yet? i was think it would be funny to have a duck cop "allegedly" lying on the floor in the back ground
[3:11:02] jimothy64: Or maybe EMS? They're gonna need to be on hand lol

[3:18:10] 80sHairMetalFan: NOTED
[3:18:11] dewhicular: 7 pts for a touchdown, a down is a play to make yardage you get 4 downs before a turnover
[3:18:17] apairidox: 5 yard penalty for tony for being Tiny and 5 yards for maple for being sticky
[3:18:33] dewhicular: in this case 4 downs to reach the halfway point, if you make it you get 4 more downs to try and score
[3:18:35] dewhicular: pretty ez
[3:18:36] Rekonin: and then they all go for a lovely hike along cassidy trail
[3:18:38] nobodybodon: he's not mentioning the rule that every 5 minutes you have to pause for 3 minutes for commercials

[3:37:47] SpaceHomer1338: Throwing is risky. Anyone can pick it up
[3:37:52] Blue_Walsh: @fahimw9 Yea the only way this would work if the mechanic pic it in your pockets if they hit you with the object
[3:38:06] wafflez9198: cant the qb also just decide to run the ball
[3:38:08] vipersummer: pd overthinking the game
[3:38:09] fahimw9: @macman385 using the same mask but throw it towards the basket and defence are allowed to tackle lol
[3:38:14] Blue_Walsh: @Blue_Walsh *put

[3:38:38] nobodybodon: no wait, this isnt the talent show
[3:38:42] macman385: they could also do rugby rules with only backward passes
[3:38:56] Acebravo_nz: American football is Soft compared to NRL
[3:39:05] wuitness: Even The scoring is confusing
[3:39:18] QuesoCommander: it's so hard to see where it goes
