[7:08:35] Galacticowboy: tessa dreads nodd
[7:08:43] Chiracho: i know what you mean though, the hair being puled back hurts at first with the hair folicles being pulled in a different direction
[7:08:45] JoeayIV: and by curls i mean like thick clumps of hair that curl
[7:09:12] Chiracho: @JoeayIV if my hair is short enough it goes like that lol

[7:12:26] nobodybodon: BALD
[7:12:30] Chiracho: oh no.. my dirty blonde is more brown with random blonde hairs throughout. so it's a puzzle sometimes.

[7:32:56] AJ_Ari: please no spoilers it‚Äôs classic
[7:33:03] IosefSerov: Is there a way to see what it looks like?
[7:33:15] thizguyfawkes: lol "no spoilers"

[7:34:56] JoeayIV: yo but do the pearls do that too?
[7:35:00] jimothy64: Yeah it being black makes it hard to see things. Some of the changes are colour based but both primary and secondary are the same
[7:35:02] Chiracho: ooohhhh nice a hue pallet
[7:35:10] IosefSerov: oh wow it's gonna turn into a ghetto blaster for sure now...all the weird rattle can additions...

[7:35:56] Risupuska: what is tessas favorite color?
[7:35:57] IosefSerov: Even just changing paint colors alone makes it look a lot diferent
[7:36:25] JoeayIV: its the style of paint, i think you need to select the pearl at the bottom to add it on top of the green
[7:36:54] JoeayIV: cream as you can on the pearl
[7:36:59] JoeayIV: just like the ATV
[7:37:05] jimothy64: Matte for the rood, metallic for the body
[7:37:11] jimothy64: Roof*
[7:37:13] retrowolf0498: Can you copy the color code?
[7:37:20] JoeayIV: i think every time you click it adds a new thing
[7:37:40] JoeayIV: makes sense
[7:37:43] retrowolf0498: So the roof would be secondary
[7:37:47] JoeayIV: that part is rather complicated i reckon
[7:38:20] jrlaweka: @nakkidas  have you heard the song.  My Barn My Rules - MCR T & horsegiirl
[7:38:52] jimothy64: Check your options again once you change the colour, some are hard to see
[7:38:56] Chiracho: damn he got that perfect KEKW
[7:39:48] JoeayIV: so you think it'd be a bad idea to make the top white like the old cop livery?
[7:39:50] IosefSerov: This is complimicated maybe have a car guy do it?
[7:39:57] Risupuska: hard to see in this dark room
[7:40:01] JoeayIV: hows the tan-ish one look, the bottom row one
[7:40:01] MinnRia: Its fun
[7:40:02] Galacticowboy: purple zebra nodd
[7:40:02] retrowolf0498: I'm between the yellow and orange pearl
[7:40:05] nobodybodon: eh
[7:40:05] TheJRoller: the lighting in here makes it hard to tell honestly
[7:40:07] jimothy64: Personally not a fan of the matte but that's me
[7:40:16] OrestesTheSloth: I thought you were gonna do something crazy. Like neon top or something

[7:40:32] Piccabo: Light green
[7:40:38] retrowolf0498: What would the lime green pearl look like?
[7:40:52] IosefSerov: I mean do you want it to stick out like Jay's car cause that could be fun, but harder to deal with as a getaway car...
[7:41:23] IosefSerov: I think a look straight out of the '70's would be cool
[7:41:36] IIIIHELLIIII: Rims?
[7:41:43] retrowolf0498: It's usually one of my go tos with darker colors. It's a good accent color
[7:41:49] jimothy64: Once you have a colour, check your other options again, some are colour based/hard to see on black
[7:42:05] IosefSerov: lol
[7:42:14] Galacticowboy: need skis
[7:42:33] JoeayIV: cream pearl
[7:42:49] OrestesTheSloth: Imagine you and your little group going on a family trip haha
[7:43:11] JoeayIV: this is your 20 min warning
[7:43:13] jimothy64: Check "Hood" again
[7:43:21] Tatsuya_Blaze: road trip to and from the house
[7:43:25] retrowolf0498: I think if it was a gray or dark blue the green pearl would be better but green on green is ok
[7:43:42] WalaStika: LUL
[7:43:46] nobodybodon: NARC horn nodd
[7:43:54] Galacticowboy: AWWWOOGA
[7:43:54] JoeayIV: click the next one and see if it still adds
[7:44:06] jimothy64: It'll be one of the last ones I think
[7:44:15] JoeayIV: yea i think you can just move on without removing it
[7:44:18] nobodybodon: you don't need to delete it every time
[7:44:31] IosefSerov: just click them all lets hear'em
[7:44:31] retrowolf0498: Airhorn to be obnoxious?
[7:44:42] nobodybodon: the EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE is a classic though
[7:44:45] Tatsuya_Blaze: airhorn down the road
[7:44:56] retrowolf0498: White headlights?
[7:45:00] jimothy64: Ah you can fix the yellow by going xenon
[7:45:03] IosefSerov: YES YOU DO lol
[7:45:08] JoeayIV: SUV
[7:45:13] IosefSerov: all over the car hehehe
[7:45:16] Chiracho: doube wide tires nodd
[7:45:23] JoeayIV: SUV or offroad for sure
[7:45:24] IosefSerov: THICC
[7:45:27] retrowolf0498: Bespoke or lowrider
[7:45:28] Risupuska: lowrider
[7:45:31] OrestesTheSloth: Need neons? no. Want neons? Heck yes
[7:45:41] jimothy64: Muscle or low rider for classic looking options
[7:45:46] JoeayIV: aw man i thought it was the tires
[7:46:09] Tatsuya_Blaze: low rider dollar signs
[7:46:13] JoeayIV: does the stancer have tire styles?
[7:46:20] Chiracho: ngl whitewalls but green would be nice
[7:46:35] jimothy64: Check Hood again
[7:46:37] IosefSerov: Do they have severe tinting for th ewindows?
[7:46:45] Galacticowboy: and the walls
[7:46:53] IosefSerov: I mean we are crimer now so...
[7:46:54] WausIsDead: this car reminds me of a russian lada
[7:47:01] nobodybodon: Tint is pointless since they're gonna be broken all the time anways nakkiWait
[7:47:11] IosefSerov: oh..true..meh
[7:47:20] JoeayIV: raise this puppy up on the stancer
[7:47:31] retrowolf0498: I hope the Cheburek gets added in later. It's literally the rockstar version of the Lada
[7:47:32] jimothy64: There's a few Hood options you couldn't see due to colour
[7:47:40] IosefSerov: you can change the headlight color I think
[7:48:54] retrowolf0498: Yea. But Xenons are decent enough to get rid of the yellow lights
[7:49:08] IosefSerov: Yep... "Hey, it's Boomer Mom" asthetic...
[7:49:22] OrestesTheSloth: Too bad the spoilers didn't really do much
[7:49:24] IosefSerov: nakkiSmug
[7:50:10] retrowolf0498: Headlight check?
[7:50:23] IosefSerov: Did she actually change those?
[7:50:40] retrowolf0498: I think she put xenons on
[7:50:43] jessyvoss: +59 EZ
[7:50:48] IosefSerov: oh those gotcha
[7:51:04] IosefSerov: oh wow that's...uh yep
[7:51:10] OrestesTheSloth: Not bad, not bad
[7:51:11] IosefSerov: perfecto
[7:51:14] JoeayIV: need to raise it up like its a pickup truck
[7:51:21] retrowolf0498: It definitely screams Ranger
[7:51:26] stephber: nakkiSteer
[7:51:28] Galacticowboy: need a sweater nodd
[7:51:28] jimothy64: I think my grandparents had a cat this exact colour
[7:51:29] witness2nv: looks great
[7:51:34] jimothy64: Car*
[7:51:34] IIIIHELLIIII: 11 minutes
[7:51:36] Tatsuya_Blaze: lift the front and drop the back
[7:51:42] stephber: inconspicous RANGER green
[7:51:47] Chiracho: do you still have to park in 4.0? i can't remember
[7:51:55] IosefSerov: i think so
[7:52:00] JoeayIV: green leather jacket with the old ranger tie undershirt
[7:52:11] witness2nv: noice~
[7:52:26] OrestesTheSloth: I like the yellow pearl though
[7:52:34] Galacticowboy: greenish brown just like a tree
[7:52:35] JoeayIV: is it stairs crafting time?
[7:52:38] witness2nv: classic
[7:52:45] JoeayIV: IT WAS CREAM PEARL
[7:52:55] OrestesTheSloth: Ooh, does she have a name?
[7:53:04] jimothy64: I'm sure if you're committed it wouldn't be hard to colour-swatch from a screenshot, but I kinda like it as is
[7:53:11] JoeayIV: cuz the cream made it match the tan part of the uniform
[7:53:15] JoeayIV: while still being green
[7:53:40] IosefSerov: Who names their car? Weird...
[7:54:00] IosefSerov: (Knows Jay named his)
[7:54:10] jimothy64: Her name is Glenda(le), the le is silent
[7:54:20] IIIIHELLIIII: Seems to be a little quicker after the fix which is good
[7:54:33] stephber: the good witch? KEKW
[7:54:38] retrowolf0498: I think the gold pearl fits since it's a new arc in Tessa's story
[7:55:00] nobodybodon: nakkiPuke
[7:55:03] adiantum3026: WICKED \o/

[7:56:11] jimothy64: On a decorating note; since you can make staircases now, consider the individual steps for floating shelves instead of the "trim" pieces
[7:56:12] IosefSerov: Obi doing the lords work
[7:56:23] IIIIHELLIIII: He was like i miss you mom
