[4:08:29] WitchenInTheKitchen: yum forbidden juice
[4:08:54] DeceitWithin: PD itself was condensed down to a skeleton crew of LSPD, dandelion
[4:09:05] DandelionLIVE: oof
[4:09:10] DandelionLIVE: thats such a shame
[4:09:32] DandelionLIVE: it feels so much like the end of an era
[4:09:32] DeceitWithin: it is but its opened new avenues so
[4:10:10] DeceitWithin: Ziggy has been able to be a crimmer now and not be burned out to fuck anymore nodd
[4:10:25] DandelionLIVE: i know, but still. Ziggy was a ranger for so much of the time i've watched that it took me a bit to try and figure out if watching would be fun anymore because how my brain handles change
[4:10:44] DandelionLIVE: I get it! I just normally don't really... watch crims
[4:10:48] DandelionLIVE: so its strange
[4:11:24] DeceitWithin: why not purple, DuPog? Smadge EAST SIDE
[4:11:31] nini_sketches: Buggs is sometimes douche looking

[4:14:22] 98_tyra: oop
[4:14:23] DreamerMori: @DandelionLIVE From what I've heard, it's because they're trying to have the pd be more uniform this time around. Towards the end of 3.0, the pd felt like a gang reping multiple different colors.
[4:14:30] atikiN_27: o7
[4:14:42] DeceitWithin: these clothes are perfect
[4:14:44] atikiN_27: going nuclear o7

[4:15:19] WitchenInTheKitchen: no time for zmail
[4:15:30] DandelionLIVE: @MentallyCrumbling I can kinda get it, but at the same time, Rangers and Normal PD have enough distinction that both could've been departments
[4:15:47] DandelionLIVE: like, what about hunting crimes and nature shit
[4:16:40] atikiN_27: @DandelionLIVE in the beginning of 4.0 there wasnt any hunting so also no hunting laws, nature laws arent also really a thing
[4:16:48] WitchenInTheKitchen: ooo we get a benchie
[4:16:56] DeceitWithin: DuPenor and Buggs, attorneys at Shaw
[4:17:03] WitchenInTheKitchen: lawyer timeeee
[4:17:43] DandelionLIVE: It just kinda. feels empty now. But maybe thats my issues with change. 's harder to watch crims for me and idk why.
[4:18:25] uwupimp: i like when ppl knock on my door because it scares my cat she, no matter where she is, will run up to behind my computer to hide
[4:18:33] DeceitWithin: DinkDonk time to smurf
[4:18:38] original_khawk: Dupog peepoWow
[4:18:43] DandelionLIVE: maybe cause most streamers i've watched play crims are just like, shooting all around and bein mean
[4:18:48] DreamerMori: banana427DANCE
[4:19:01] atikiN_27: that okay, takes some getting used to for some people, one thing tho dandelion, Ziggy isnt really a 'crimer' now cuz he has his bar and thus needs to keep things on the DL
[4:19:06] atikiN_27: HAYES!
[4:19:08] atikiN_27: :)
[4:20:04] DandelionLIVE: oh? But i thought he was a criminal now? sorry for all the questions, i've not been here for a while
