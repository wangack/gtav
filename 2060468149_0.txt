[7:46:37] Paula_Thunder: @dripydryp no, multiple countries
[7:46:37] asakka: Madge purpose
[7:46:39] Erigzback: what lol
[7:46:43] Frakkles: PURPOSE Madge
[7:46:43] one_two_x_you730: Sleepy Sean rigging the votes through dead people
[7:46:54] Ryponino: just do some necromancy shit and bring him back and then ask him NODDERS
[7:46:57] Miditron6000: Purpose Madge
[7:47:00] dripydryp: @paula_thunder so then it‚Äôs a kingdom
[7:47:02] yoyomancoolman: but u do though
[7:47:04] ShrimpCommander: LUL if they are worried about the dead guy's rights pd pinky promises not to prosecute or put the dead guy in jail 4Head
[7:47:06] KennedyFnPowers: pentawPain
[7:47:07] AndyCrisp: say your wife dies. you would have proxy of their estate
[7:47:09] Timmo001: Isnt them being dead reason enough?
[7:47:10] one_two_x_you730: They heard Kyle was involved, kyle locked
[7:47:12] watchesyou_sleep: isnt that reason because he is dead?
[7:47:12] esrou: It's already there
[7:47:15] Amazon455: That sounds really dumb
[7:47:19] Frakkles: That's stupid.
[7:47:20] LewkieSE: Entry wound from a gun here ->  Exit wound from a gun here ->  records please
[7:47:22] Paula_Thunder: @dripydryp hence, united kingdom
[7:47:23] kylesfart: Sounds extremely stupid KEKW
[7:47:26] Erigzback: That would be a good convo to have lol
[7:47:34] for___nothing: @Paula_Thunder WOOW
[7:47:35] Frakkles: You learn so much from a phone off a dead person.
[7:47:35] KarlDRGg: United Kingdom - its in the name..
[7:47:36] sterowentUS: she'll have to define a pattern
[7:47:47] Slesh5: I mean Idk you'd want to know who was the victim in contact last no? isn't that good enough reason?
[7:47:48] yoyomancoolman: yeah the fued is reason enough imo
[7:47:54] Timmo001: Hearsay is ok I guess for evidence collection
[7:47:55] speedracer38: LUL
[7:48:06] Lampan_: Dead people have no rights though
[7:48:06] watchesyou_sleep: hes not going to care
[7:48:08] watchesyou_sleep: hes dead
[7:48:08] sterowentUS: through some CID gang intel or something
[7:48:11] Miditron6000: Dead people dont have rights
[7:48:15] Erigzback: Can the dead guy sue you for taking his phone?
[7:48:16] KennedyFnPowers: home sweet home
[7:48:19] Swalsugmass: murder investigations its normal cops get access to their phone records to you know track there movements before you know they were murdered
[7:48:20] AndyCrisp: Dead people have rights you idiots
[7:48:27] TrashGaming73: his spirit said i can
[7:48:31] Demosthenex: We must protect the dead
[7:48:51] Frakkles: I don't get that at all.
[7:48:52] AndyCrisp: its not about the dead its about their families.
[7:49:00] vantarts: occams elp
[7:49:06] mlangcs: how do you even progress anything because you have no breadcrumbs
[7:49:16] EZbutnotsoEZ: they have rights but of course police can get their records for investigation of their murder LUL
[7:49:18] mlangcs: you have nothing to go off
[7:49:26] IamLostinourRainbow: just supeana the phone
[7:49:30] AndyCrisp: in rp i have no idea how you would work around not having surviving family members.
[7:49:32] AnalgesicPM: well the phone records would technically "belong" to the phone company right?
[7:49:35] Ryponino: pentawPain
[7:49:41] Slesh5: by that logic you can't search the body's pockets either -sounds silly
[7:49:48] kmhong: probably a low bar for such a warrant
[7:49:55] sinleet: you can't search his house either, he might have a phonebook
[7:50:23] ShrimpCommander: whelp, the murdered body did nothing wrong. Can't search pockets, phone, detain, or anything to the body 4Head
[7:50:43] Ivory_Scion: living on the beach like Mel Gibson in Lethal Weapon
[7:51:26] trenchkidjayz: Later today? OO
[7:51:39] Erigzback: Pretty sure just saying suspected homicide would give you the pc for a phone warrant of someone diseased.
[7:51:42] vantarts: ye
[7:51:46] mlangcs: but how do you even reach to that and articulate that
[7:51:53] puddra: just need to add that to the warrant
[7:51:55] EZbutnotsoEZ: @Erigzback yeah. (deceased)
[7:52:00] notparanoidbut: mmHmm
[7:52:03] Frakkles: I really hate that. It's SO limiting.
[7:52:13] Slesh5: the reason should be the same for any murder investigation: you want to know who was the victim in contact last
[7:52:17] Erigzback: @EZbutnotsoEZ Thanks. I'm central time on the pred schedule half asleep haha.
[7:52:20] abadbadman: i gotta go to work pepoYELL
[7:52:28] mlangcs: there was a foul play and executed in paleto Shrug
[7:52:29] libylol123: probably autopsy stuff
[7:52:31] EZbutnotsoEZ: @Erigzback hehe
[7:52:33] Ivory_Scion: God dammit, Riggs. Figure it out!
[7:52:35] Zartation: it just sounds like they want that in writing as supposed to just asking for the records
[7:52:36] Frakkles: Who goes into work at 1PM?
[7:52:40] Rem753: moseChatter this guy is dead. he was executed. can has phone?
[7:52:46] Zartation: like they want you to just do the busy work
[7:52:49] Zone_Mans: NODDERS

[7:53:02] EZbutnotsoEZ: yeah, that's enough
[7:53:03] Frakkles: @abadbadman Fair
[7:53:15] EZbutnotsoEZ: @Napmaster can try seance Kappa
[7:53:26] ShrimpCommander: judge will be like what PC did that gov employee have to perform the autopsy at this point
[7:53:26] Erigzback: We believe this death to be a homicide. Based on this fact we would like to see phone records.
[7:53:39] EZbutnotsoEZ: ^
[7:53:39] puglife9123: Was that a boondock saints reference
[7:53:40] Reijn: It would make burner phones and aliases that much more important.
[7:53:48] bgdrew: was the subpoena written with that information or was it a barebones outline?
[7:53:49] kevspatiag112: Bambi and nova playing helldrivers
