[2:10:35] NemisizZ: door seems to work today at least
[2:10:37] ky05uk3: must be some heating/airflow thing
[2:11:07] Xpatrol: did u try to pick them up and put them back ?
[2:11:07] svan223: more heaters?
[2:11:29] Xpatrol: like roll bills with WM when its was scuff
[2:11:30] nettomek: huminity check on panel
[2:11:32] ky05uk3: Do you have any racks setup in your apt? could be a decent place to play around with the racks and airflow stuff
[2:11:48] legoliket: Maybe they dry up after tsunami
[2:12:14] nettomek: i think 50 percent humidity
[2:12:26] spoonfullofMusic: guys its obvious, the weed is wet cause its still horny allright
[2:12:39] NemisizZ: 0 humidity
[2:12:57] NemisizZ: lol
[2:12:59] nettomek: maybe im wrong i heard it somewhere
[2:13:07] legoliket: 0 humitidy wtf yeah might be the issue
[2:13:09] 911_raj: Cold
[2:13:44] NemisizZ: u would think the dryer and hotter the better
[2:13:44] Nightbot: IMGONNACUM
[2:13:45] legoliket: Humitidy should be 55-60
[2:13:51] legoliket: %
[2:14:07] FatBored: I mean if the humidity is 0% it would still dry lol
[2:14:14] yeslewd: there is % in the icon
[2:14:20] scha_de: I would be fine if they wouldnt change the whole weed system every 3 days
[2:14:21] yeslewd: Shruge
[2:14:25] JDwight: hmm i wonder if heat and cool need to balance
[2:14:26] NemisizZ: the lower the humidity the faster it would dry... or thats how it works irl at least
[2:14:36] JDwight: that wouldnâ€™t make sense though
[2:14:58] NemisizZ: might be a disabled variable
[2:15:05] NemisizZ: or not displaying proper
[2:15:14] ky05uk3: Might need to consult another grower? SHRUGGERS
[2:15:15] FatBored: humidity is measured by % though in general
[2:15:16] NemisizZ: it doesnt say anything if you hover over it?
[2:15:33] yeslewd: @FatBored but nothing else is measured by their correct stuff
[2:15:34] Xpatrol: U shouldnt except too much , scuff happen every day
[2:15:34] Nightbot: IMGONNACUM
[2:15:51] Proomal: DONOTCUM
[2:16:02] krepana: call someone who knows
[2:16:08] NemisizZ: ahh
[2:16:10] FatBored: @yeslewd I mean what would you measure ventilation by? I don't think most people are familiar with cfm
[2:16:10] Xpatrol: for now not worth the time
[2:16:30] NemisizZ: not to mention if any of the assets has an effect
[2:16:36] JDwight: KEKW
[2:16:36] NemisizZ: like the heaters and that
[2:16:52] minimadman91: it all about the good bacteria LUL
[2:16:56] NemisizZ: yeah exactly, do they even do anything
[2:16:59] yeslewd: I though AK said he dried without them
[2:17:08] scha_de: I still dont believe they have an effect, because I dont know how you would even code that tbh KEKW
[2:17:08] yeslewd: at the start
[2:17:13] svan223: devs change shit everyday
[2:17:13] Capablist: devs taken, find out in rp too far Madge
[2:17:14] svan223: with weed
[2:17:23] MadChemistTHC: I doutb it, imo the rack would have a heater slot like the plants have for weater
[2:17:25] MadChemistTHC: water
[2:17:41] krepana: just put 20 heaters it gonna dry or burn
[2:18:08] scha_de: I mean stuff dried on the small racks yesterday, no?
[2:18:11] yeslewd: humidity must be bugged, because realistically 0 is impossible
[2:18:24] legoliket: Is there even a humidifier in the house furniture shop?
[2:18:54] Xpatrol: U put them 2days ago for the longest no ?
[2:18:54] Nightbot: IMGONNACUM
[2:19:00] FatBored: imo it would make sense that house values would affect things like this because why else would they be there (assuming it's implemented)
[2:19:01] spoonfullofMusic: humidity is the percentage of water in the air, at 0 means no water in the air guys so it should be fine
[2:19:11] NemisizZ: yeah it would be impossible, unless ur in a vacuum @yeslewd
[2:19:19] Suvaacc: have you tried to take out computer parts and re-place the computer for strain scuff?
[2:19:42] NemisizZ: think the driest place on earth is like 20% humidity
[2:19:54] minimadman91: @spoonfullofmusic at 0 humidity youâ€™d be smoking hay in three days
[2:20:25] Xpatrol: I know atleast one group how cant set up their strain name too , so its scuff probably
[2:20:46] spoonfullofMusic: we need the danish to take a look at it Kappa
[2:20:52] Suvaacc: @Xpatrol yeah its scuff then
[2:21:16] Xpatrol: @NemisizZ 0.3% humidity record
[2:21:17] scha_de: I know Tobii was able to click the strain button yesterday on his Shruge So its not a global issue
[2:21:32] Xpatrol: yes
[2:21:44] yeslewd: I think u can buy them now, no?
[2:21:44] Xpatrol: a lot use bison
[2:21:49] NemisizZ: @Xpatrol damn that low, must be Antarctic or something like that

[4:49:48] legoliket: Hasn't it always been 3 days to dry?
[4:49:54] xl__8s: I think if you move the rack is reset
[4:50:05] Pheyerus: Did you try naming it when you had dry weed ready to sell or was it still all drying
[4:50:12] legoliket: It was 3 days to dry when people had their racks in the apartments
[4:51:29] toremahsack: more air circulation helps
[4:51:59] MythstaDythlexic: Yeah and ppl figured out how to speed up growing since then. My theory is nobody actually has a proper dry room if everyone still on 3 day drying

[4:53:52] scha_de: time to ask my old boomer friend, urban dictionary
[4:54:13] legoliket: No name set strain hardest kush in Southside travpiDhead
[4:54:16] KaiFulci: what?
[4:54:18] toremahsack: haa haa
[4:54:20] KaiFulci: wara?
[4:54:22] scha_de: The use of the phrase "no cap" is meant to convey authenticity and truth. The phrase originated in reference to decorative gold teeth, which can be divided into two distinct varieties: permanent gold teeth (aka "perms") or caps (aka "pullouts")
[4:54:23] spoonfullofMusic: no caption needed no cap
[4:54:28] EnigmaQuip: knowyourmeme is the other boomer dictionary
[4:54:35] scha_de: Whereas caps can be pulled out with ease, perms, as their name suggests, are permanent. They cannot be taken out for a job interview or court date. They are an honest and lasting expression of the owners' realness.
