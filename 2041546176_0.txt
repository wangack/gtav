[5:38:42] manfreygordon: @MustBeTheGreatest it helps you sleep because a hot shower cools down your core temperature
[5:38:43] TastyKudzu: That means harry can also power level pretty much anyone. Plant 100 plants, let them gather them all.
[5:38:46] ElWeto: yup
[5:38:47] chrino7: Plus the butt coin
[5:38:47] MustBeTheGreatest: if you expose yourself to ewarmth your core temp after drops and visa versa, in order to sleep you have to drop your cortisol which in turn drops your core temp

[5:49:25] CuppaT_XYZ: so different apps for gang and weed?
[5:49:33] natediggitty__: Arush has a couple of boys
[5:49:34] EmuinKC: I honestly expect the membership to rotate depending on the content of the day
[5:49:38] MustBeTheGreatest: @Harry the lang harry weed runs must return even maybe with some drinks
[5:49:38] jambag00: i guess clean people will not be on app?
[5:49:38] Laffing_Man: do you think the play might be getting another grower with a different strain?
[5:49:40] watermelontoboggan: Can get them going on a second turf down the line
[5:49:45] lightstormclaw: @CuppaT_XYZ no its all tied together
[5:49:49] kingtom0063: I think you should just leave it at the 5 heads then octo and Yuno
[5:49:55] OriginalGibsta: maybe need to make a computer room upstairs where one of the growers can add their strain
[5:49:56] Wo7lf1: @Wo7lf1 Its more wider options on the PC And no gang and weed is incorporated into one
[5:49:56] CuppaT_XYZ: NOTED
[5:50:21] Xernique: @lightstormclaw he prob means that they need to buy a new pc+hq app for the gang shit later
[5:50:38] deusrexx: Might be feasible to eat the BTC cost of subbing group members.
[5:50:41] hippiehs: maybe we will get another gang app for something else in the future, but right now its only the weed/turf app available
[5:50:42] FreshPosty: its 12 bought in, 14 possible. but its ever growing. even if it is 12 on the list you might not want to fill it
[5:50:50] TheRejectsAzFTwitch: I think the point is the main house/app is the Don's, then each section has their own house and app. It's a collaborative network so 1 guy doesn't have everything under their name. I could be wrong

[6:29:57] LietK: @CozyxVibes folders in editor
[6:29:58] Tamzim: Make them Green :)
[6:29:58] Pistol922: putting the items into a "folder"
[6:30:01] MrProtagonist: its occlusion. doesn't load assets you cant see
[6:30:01] Pistol922: in the editor
[6:30:02] KingDekar: got a clip
[6:30:02] iiidaaah: yeah, so it only loads rooms per room
[6:30:03] Nichols_C: yea making the rooms like the apartments they load when you walk in
[6:30:04] KingDekar: if u want
[6:30:04] bahartin: same as apartments basically, they load when you enter
[6:30:06] ChiefinIt: X was saying the devs think its from all the trash and items on the ground in the houses
[6:30:06] Puk3s: it will only load items in the nearest room
[6:30:07] deusrexx: It hides rooms when door is closed
[6:30:08] KingDekar: otherwise its a pain
[6:30:10] Frankii: create a room and put the furniture inside
[6:30:10] shiifon: NODDERS
[6:30:12] Hogie48: Like your appartment
[6:30:12] chichar00n: !song

[6:30:13] Nightbot: The Current Song is ‘tis the damn season by Taylor Swift
[6:30:13] robot_pirates: yeah, create rooms in the app, it will only load if you are in it
[6:30:13] blitz_fabian: yeah green box room option or something like that
[6:30:13] EnzikFires: seperates loading zones id imagine
[6:30:15] Nichols_C: but does that mean you cant puts stuff on the floor?
[6:30:17] Korathor: Like a 3d layout were you separate areas
[6:30:17] potatowarrior411: keeps everything from rendering at same time
[6:30:17] TastyKudzu: it only loads the specific room you're in
[6:30:18] destinyschildbride: assets don’t load
[6:30:20] NoblesseXXX: Room doesn't load
[6:30:21] iiidaaah: it only loads rooms you are in or close too
[6:30:23] ahr1than: Y can make rooms so subsections of the house are loaded at a time, just like the house inside doesnt load from the road
[6:30:25] Hentai__Dad: loads the top floors then bottom
[6:30:26] KingDekar: basically think how the apartments work
[6:30:27] RichieG0913: in the builder you create a room which you create a box and place the items in the box so the items load and unload when you are in the rooms
[6:30:35] KingDekar: only loads when u open the doors
[6:30:37] vo_Michael: Room doesn’t load until you are close as opposed to the whole house
[6:30:39] Puk3s: thats why when you step on grass of houses it lags, they are 1 big room
[6:30:44] Fuhtzzz: damn harry got the swiftie only bangers on rn
[6:30:45] mrdumpling420: Anyone gonna design the top floor or does that cost alot
[6:30:45] da5id_h: its genius

[6:31:08] Nichols_C: @Puk3s grass whats that?
[6:31:20] deusrexx: Ray explains how to do it. Its particular on how you have to set up which item exists in each room.
[6:31:23] mrdumpling420: @vemeneses like a kitchen or couches.. maybe a TV lol what you mean 🤔

[9:53:23] TastyKudzu: Yeah, they optimized their routine into an L with both people taking down.
[9:53:36] TastyKudzu: @Kaaylev It only loads the room you're in.
[9:53:50] bonewp: @bonewp yeah they have a tool in the editor that let you make areas and that makes not load instantly every single thing in the house

[9:56:06] leakybum_999: no adrenaline rush if it’s too easy🤣🤣🤣
[9:56:09] bonewp: the thing is you guys keep adding thing on the basement and if you guys keep taking this long to make the change its gonna be a hustle to amke the rooms
[9:56:13] redemer12: more rp will come from it when guns get unlocked
[9:56:15] StamaasG: Doesn't make sense from the workers side either, why would they risk their job for a 1000$ paycheck from Harry
[9:56:28] ErraticSwami: @normanberlin the devs added a tool to the game to fix this. RayC just did it at their house. should actually reduce overall lag on server once everyone uses it
[9:56:30] TastyKudzu: One day someone is going to hit a lick lock-picking his car while he's in the sewers.
[9:56:31] redemer12: its a slow burn and honestly better that way

[9:57:30] FinnaCrow: YEP
[9:57:50] wilson060: yeah its a great way to regulate it
[9:57:52] rollesaurus: also think it for visual rp effect for the high star g6 employers
[9:58:04] TastyKudzu: The money is actually fake, the fence is just paying you $30 for the nice wood pallet. Kappa
[9:58:05] atxplayer781: Or a special shop of some sort
[9:58:11] 11_jakjak_11: Yeah that's how pushing weed was as well
[9:58:14] coriell11: yeah alright
[9:58:14] Tamzim: maybe better for banks and stuff later
[9:58:15] FinnaCrow: i think it's pesos thats why
[9:58:16] CyanMig: could say its money thats being sent to be destroyed due to being out of circulation
[9:58:19] HallJams: it'd be interesting if they lost rep per bag stolen
[9:58:22] misfit_justice: if it was worth too much, then people would get robbed too much, then people would stop doing g6
[9:58:26] ViodBrain: Paid in exposer SADGE
[9:58:31] sirpercidal: could be lots of opportunities later. who knows could even open up to Robbing the bank
[9:58:36] wilson060: and there's a pawn shop in game Hmmm
[9:58:43] coldeveryday: huffing

[9:58:50] EnzikFires: house robberies?
[9:58:59] TastyKudzu: My guess is that this is the guy that leads to heists.
