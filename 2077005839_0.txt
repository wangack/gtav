[1:44:46] OprahSideMan: I like Ruth as a character but I think the issue that everybody has with her character right now is that she makes rash and vindictive decisions and has nobody above her to correct it
[1:44:47] racoon21: what's the objective of the audit?
[1:44:52] Bosweny: Rush promoted Seniors that think just like her so it created an even more strict environment

[1:54:15] XxTeam48LowesXx: Missed the Jenny rank
[1:54:20] minnmor: ^
[1:54:20] Nightbot: ^^ What they said nikkisSmile
[1:54:23] Elmatron97: So whats the different between having a chief of police over a commish when there is no commish of rhte CoP to answer to?
[1:54:37] Chezzerz93: Do you think that's a reason they're short staffed? people have a similar opinion on the PD "Look at the state of it"
[1:54:38] OprahSideMan: so where does senior and all that come in ?
[1:54:54] GrumpyMark01: The Jenny rank will never be used again

[1:56:48] GrumpyMark01: Commish is also very political
[1:56:57] lettison: How about commissioner carmine?
[1:57:04] PH4MTOM: Almost like Chief Justice?
[1:57:04] limerick2018: I will be honest I think dab just liked the name of commissioner
[1:57:31] UASangWINik: technically the mayor is the commissioner right now before one is appointed
[1:57:37] Rhizwynd: He called commisioner because of Batman
[1:57:43] AnusReaktorMan: Ruby for cop BERIC for comms EZ
[1:57:45] MonkeMonoMania: Would it make more sense then to have the commissioner to sit on the council meetings instead of a liason
[1:57:50] ikahala: But a COP would still answer to Max, right?
[1:57:54] Sathure: So you need a Nathankb_ but for PD?
[1:57:58] minnmor: it was clear yesterday with mick ;D
[1:58:19] Elmatron97: If you don't know, best thing is to employ people who do and thats exactly what the major has done to be fair

[2:01:24] OprahSideMan: I don’t think the PD was failing , I think they were moving a little to slow and focusing on some things that were taking them in the wrong direction
[2:01:36] filipe_vasconcellos_: guys she gonna get a felony on saturday nikkisGiggle
[2:01:40] UASangWINik: tbh moon did spend like 2-3 hours discussing PD issues with Malton and Crane
[2:01:51] Bosweny: i think genuinely the DAP system is bad. They give DAPs but dont provide actual correction so people don't understand what they did wrong and feel targeted
[2:01:53] minnmor: @filipe_vasconcellos_ right before the big meeting? nikkisGiggle

[4:56:00] Ravidge: would be nice to interview those who aren't on duty... but they're hard to get a in room ofc
[4:56:13] minnmor: just like the gauntlent... its gone
[4:56:21] natikar: @Ravidge yeah this is a good point, see why they arent coming on
[4:56:34] Evezh_: the “dap issue” is that they are handed out to liberally, but thats a leadership fault not the daps themselves
[4:56:40] Chezzerz93: is it because like you said before “it’s a shit show” so it’s putting new people off joining PD?
[4:56:47] PrettyKrazy: ask the people who got on for for the first time in a while
[4:56:56] abdirahmanmomo: the daps is a good however they need alternative punishments which help them out so they dont make the mistake again
[4:56:59] PrettyKrazy: obv some rng in availability but...
[4:57:02] Kaztiell: @Evezh_ they are handed out as the sops are written
[4:57:16] kavcav: I know a handful of the early hires were variety streamers who stopped playing, but I think it's the lack of veteran coos who know how to make the role interesting
[4:57:17] sammelweis: daps being the length they are is an issue I think
[4:57:25] kavcav: *cops
[4:57:41] ImMcGuirk: i think the issue is the lack of murder
[4:57:48] sammelweis: they have to LEARN from the DAPs
[4:57:49] PeterPleb1992: @Kaztiell they are handed out BEFORE they are written KEKW
[4:57:51] filipe_vasconcellos_: @ImMcGuirk  NODDERS
[4:57:57] PrettyKrazy: mhm lack of support for the daps
[4:58:04] Evezh_: @kaztiell but not every sop violation NEEDS a dap I think daps should come after some form of warning or alternative punishment
[4:58:08] PrettyKrazy: daps are skeleton it just needs muscles to hold it up
[4:58:13] captain_steve_420: basically the daps are fine, it's how they're being used which is the problem
[4:58:24] NupeKeem: what daps?
[4:58:27] Kaztiell: @Evezh_ most of the people had warnigns before stuff they got dapped for, also only 9 cops ahve daps xd
[4:58:35] sammelweis: I
[4:58:44] PrettyKrazy: if half the dap'ees dont know why or VEHEMENTLY disagree with them then thats its own issue
[4:58:46] abdirahmanmomo: its 19 now
[4:58:48] Elmatron97: Whats your thoughts on people who play for longer having a larger threshold for dabs?
[4:58:49] captain_steve_420: @Kaztiell That's just flat wrong. I know 16 cops rn that have daps
[4:58:49] Funkchamp: Do they also use the daps as a teaching moment? Do they bother to explain why they received the dap or teach the proper directions?
[4:58:56] SaRAWRuby: when there no balance why would ppl wana get on cop
[4:58:57] theshaolinpanda: Chief or Commissioner?
[4:58:59] natikar: lovesick had that good suggestion yesterday about working them off by coming on duty too
[4:59:02] NupeKeem: so daps are strike point  basically
[4:59:04] Kaztiell: @captain_steve_420 then I guess Turner was wrong when he said it a day ago
[4:59:07] PeterPleb1992: i mean handing them out 10 days after an event and during someone airing a grievance is a huge problem lol

[5:02:00] TheRealMemow: did dab interview jenny yet?
[5:02:02] RebornOffline: even if you don't have a say, you're doing an audit and can always make a recommendation based on your findings I guess
[5:02:13] filipe_vasconcellos_: @TheRealMemow for what?
[5:02:26] TheRealMemow: @filipe_vasconcellos_ the police review
[5:02:27] Chezzerz93: Are you allowed to give your suggestions for Chief in your end review?
[5:02:30] theshaolinpanda: @sammelweis 4th guy is Simone right? The deputy mayor?
[5:02:37] filipe_vasconcellos_: @TheRealMemow she is not a cop
[5:02:38] sammelweis: @theshaolinpanda no - one of the judges
[5:02:42] captain_steve_420: Viv isnt a senior so I dont think she's elligible for commisioner
[5:02:45] kingshwing: Do you think King would make good HC?
[5:02:47] Doqx42: Seriousness put into forth on the officers seems to have drained a lot of energy.
[5:02:57] theshaolinpanda: I haven't seen or heard the 4th guy

[5:03:24] Shockwave_005: That's a nice loophole

[5:04:01] younghof27: I think no captins should get promoted
[5:04:03] Chezzerz93: I don’t think Cornwood wants it because it’ll look like obv favouritism from Max rather than earning it
[5:04:06] captain_steve_420: True, but if a comissioner is chosen based on a loophole it could look bad
[5:04:07] MrSpiny: Crane loves his loopholes nikkisGiggle
