[0:11:17] cattogun97: Matto, wouldn't it be easier (yet more tedious) to steal a tank as Trevor outside of the mission, using his special ability, give it to Michael, let him store it at his airport hangar (if you own that one), than go pick it up there?
[0:11:19] BobTheMartin: Feels like old GTA when you can do this BS and not mission fail

[0:31:54] BobTheMartin: Noooooo Matt the Bill Gates sponsorship D:
[0:31:55] jamsian_: you can also find the micro-transaction currency within the game for free. similar to how you can get gta$ from playing the game or shark cards
[0:32:01] MayconFrr: Do you use the xbox acessories app to keep your controller up to date?
[0:32:11] gtaspeedrun5: Theres no point trying to get the tank in ls, you fail in paleto score

[0:34:24] cold_play1278: what took you so long? "what took you so long"
[0:34:24] Cold_War_Goat: Double kill!
[0:34:25] woodybus2033399: i played sea of thieves for a while now and in recent times their seasons stuff is fading as most updates come out monthly but they are still keeping their seasonal idea just so microsoft can milk off people buying their ancient coins (paid currency) and like if you buy it for 999 coins you get 1000 coins back and most cosmetics are like 500 coins so it seems they only keep the pass so they can get more people to buy ancient coins thus more profit

[1:11:38] Wryfrost: I hope we have better explosive resistance in GTA 6. Pretty sure you used to be able to take multiple explosions in San Andreas and other games from back then. I get the realism angle but it’s just not fun and also makes PVP worse when missiles and the like come into play.
