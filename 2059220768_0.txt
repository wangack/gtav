[3:56:45] FecalWang: MOLEEYES
[3:56:45] JarrodBaniqued: The problem was in the voice acting
[3:56:45] mosseaterrr: MOLEEYES
[3:56:49] underwaterpoogirl: movie trailers just tend to suck in general imo
[3:56:50] noriatak: @Jabroni_Mike mike, if you want bad animations, look at the scene in the trailer where they start shooting the tennis balls, they just spawn out of nowhere.
[3:56:50] Wololojuice: MOLEEYES
[3:56:52] Fuzzzycatgames: it's going to be entirely mid movie that is fun for just about everyone to watch
[3:56:53] rogh23: there are small details that become glaringly obvious once they are pointed out
[3:56:53] phoecalwright: youre saying that you cant tell 2d from 3d?

[3:57:11] SplortBuffet: Dirk autism
[3:57:11] RasheokLTD: Also it looking like the first one is not good, that movie came out like 15 years ago @Jabroni_Mike
[3:57:11] NorthOfEarth: Dirk needs a Segway BADLY
[3:57:13] 8bitbeetle: ppHop
[3:57:13] boredlizzie40whacks: can Dirks look up?
[3:57:14] bluntman4200: cloth physics Pog
[3:57:16] JohnFrogman1349: someone needs to be brought to justice for that emote Stare
[3:57:17] Soywich: It probably reminds him of one big long leg.
[3:57:17] whette_fahrtz: it looks like the stream of shit from tubgirl

[3:57:29] aBoner89: Maldoid SteerR
[3:57:30] Awesome_Femboi3: yo wtf did they get a animation cut for that trailer????
[3:57:30] Metavolca: Mike Megamind the movie was mostly a satire on the superhero genre while the Megamind show looks like the most generic Marvel slop seen today
[3:57:30] veilsnow: No keys though Sadge
[3:57:32] spineshark99: The Dirkmobile
[3:57:33] 8bitbeetle: Smoge
[3:57:41] Awesome_Femboi3: i JUST watched it
[3:57:45] BrazilianAnarchy: Oldge 14 years ago
[3:57:52] RabidCowolf: @jabroni_mike it just feels like those shitty direct to dvd sequels that Disney used to do where they never got the original voice actors
[3:57:52] borrelias: ok it does look worse visually. its pretty stiff and the lighting is a bit doo doo, it looks more like a tv shows budget
[3:57:55] Strangely_Epic: dude i just watched the trailer, im so sad, megamind is genuinely one of my favorite kids movies Sadge wtf.
[3:57:57] HoboNoah: I just watched it and the biggest thing getting to me is the stiff animation
[3:57:57] MrSilentBard: YEP
[3:57:57] rose__eater: the first one doesnt look bad tho
[3:58:00] BrazilianAnarchy: yeah
[3:58:01] Soywich: It's all generic marvel slop.
[3:58:02] Coleycow: @Metavolca could just be the marketing?
[3:58:02] JarrodBaniqued: It took 36 years to make Top Gun 2, ya know
[3:58:03] SplortBuffet: youtube
[3:58:04] Phoenix1333: green ogre is best movie
[3:58:04] autofecalectomy: thats not what devils advocate means
[3:58:05] 2men1teacup: right
[3:58:05] MrSilentBard: The trailer showed exactly that
[3:58:07] poop_sock_sounding: how much milk in them man boobs blud 💀
[3:58:08] thedoodler303: 14 year old animation looks better than the new one which is really fucking hard to do yet they did it somehow
[3:58:08] spineshark99: Well yea thats what people want (apparently)
[3:58:09] RabidCowolf: It should look as good as Puss in Boots 2
[3:58:09] booty_menace: Megamind never needed a sequel tbh
[3:58:11] peacefulautistic: @phoecalwright Last night he said he couldn’t tell traditional stop motion from animated stop motion. That’s what he meant.
[3:58:11] Rowsdowerrrrr: the term satire is thrown around too loosely these days
[3:58:11] whette_fahrtz: thats what the people want Sadge
[3:58:11] poopsiren: COCKA
[3:58:13] aBoner89: PawgChamp stiff
[3:58:13] RustRoomOfDookie: it looks fine to you because you have degraded senses in your old age
[3:58:13] MalContentus_: notice how they never do close ups in the trailer cause the faces are too bad
[3:58:14] boredlizzie40whacks: stiff cocks
[3:58:14] grimep_00: The knuckles show looks the same as the movie
[3:58:16] GettingDewormedAtWendys: I think a media franchise should retain its quality throughout somewhat regardless of the medium
[3:58:18] stankmart: :)
[3:58:20] Awesome_Femboi3: IT LOOKS LIKE A ANIMATIED TV SHOW
[3:58:23] woolioshit: I hate it when im typing a message and it doesnt send and idk which word is banned in the Mike chat KEKW
