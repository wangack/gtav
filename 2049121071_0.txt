[0:32:34] IMrBubbles: @flaxxx_btw  neutrenLove
[0:32:49] Fugeki: I feel like chopping will lead to bin scratches seeing how the progression is
[0:32:49] iLLuSi0NN: But it can unlock a lot of shit later prob
[0:32:58] pecannepie: but what if it leads to boosting
[0:33:05] kebbi: yeah its a long process
[0:33:20] KitKatSNAAAACKS: Is the process really worth it?
[0:33:20] Fugeki: sometimes you have to do the shit to get the benefits later on
[0:33:24] Shad0w_wizard: @argonize I think he was going to Japan for like 2 weeks so I know we at most got 1 week till he comes back
[0:33:25] JohnInxane: hey neutren n chat! neutrenHi neutrenSteer

[0:34:07] Vehe: @unbairu Yea
[0:34:21] Lunalynn4: @KitKatSNAAAACKS For rep everything is worth it
[0:34:26] pecannepie: doesnt arush pay out at meetings now tho
[0:34:29] chillsley16: Hopefully the rep ends up worth it!
[0:34:31] Fugeki: gotta max all car related stuff just in case KEK
[0:34:43] Lunalynn4: Rep leads to more exiting stuff
[0:34:56] argonize: yeah just gotta grind it out unfortunately
[0:34:58] Koltary: @Fugeki im imagining chopping later on leading to vin scratching tbh
[0:35:12] NerZulek: chop probably lead to boosting later on
[0:35:30] iLLuSi0NN: You dont
[0:35:39] pecannepie: naah
[0:35:48] iLLuSi0NN: Crime doesnt lose u rep
[0:35:49] mimmakata: bosses are snitches
[0:35:52] bird24287: or all depends on the color on the app
[0:35:56] chillsley16: Yeah they are forcing people into 1 job. which is very realistic I guess but doesn’t make the best RP
[0:35:57] Auruanix: crim reps are separate from civ no?
[0:36:02] Fugeki: there is a system you can look at the tablet where you can see what conflicts
[0:36:04] bird24287: blues clash with green
[0:36:08] Splashy_Pants: @IMrBubbles oh dang ty for the gift sub!
[0:36:31] argonize: atleast grime is easy to get rep back
[0:36:32] Koltary: i dont think you should lose rep from crime to civ unless its directly related, like selling g6 bags = losing g6 rep, but generally how would your grime boss know you're chopping
[0:36:38] sarahm9889: you're basically doing this for science
[0:36:47] IMrBubbles: @Splashy_Pants  neutrenLove 󠀀
[0:36:53] jim530d: maybe
[0:36:59] Fugeki: like one yellow one green is ok also one red but if you try to mix them it lowers rep
[0:37:09] CYDERVERSE: !backseat

[0:56:18] fambaa: weed barely pays, the rightmost pile is computer stuff
[0:56:19] kbeaton: does octo know about his debt being reduced?
[0:56:24] FairlyFunnyFelineFriend: you're basically cleaning all the weed money
[0:56:31] ktothec99: Seems more about the rep and progression than the money no?
[0:56:33] kentripp: they bought the house an then all the furnishings
[0:56:33] Akanzaa_: Helloo
[0:56:33] sshinn7: Speedy is the accountant 😂 what do u expect 😂
[0:56:37] ishouldprobably: weed biz isn't profitable at all to start
[0:56:40] reyvanr: Poor PepeLa

[0:56:42] unIuko: in the heaters LUL
[0:56:44] reichenbachs: the weed money is the dirty rolls
[0:56:44] daniel2keer: its for the rep

[0:56:47] lucidious_fox: It can't be nothing
[0:56:48] style959: theyre not going for money, they go for rep
[0:56:48] AdLib_24: harry uses weed money to reinvest in growing weed too
[0:56:50] sandip38j: Computersales
[0:56:51] AK1N0M_: they do it for rep it doesnt really pay off
[0:56:52] argonize: weed is free labor KEKW
[0:56:54] pecannepie: people get paid out now by arush
[0:56:54] OWBallaz: 30 40k for weed i think, it is not alot
[0:56:55] Lunalynn4: Why do you feel u cant ask in character?
[0:56:56] ROFLobster: Ask Speedy, he would probably just tell Octavio
[0:56:57] bird24287: Tony broke broke
[0:56:57] chillsley16: Yuno made a ton on computer sales
[0:56:58] meow_cats0: I mean, this sounds like something you 100% could ask IC, if you wanted to know all that
[0:56:59] NoQox: its gotta be something cant be nothing KEKW
[0:57:00] Fugeki: Tony and luc are the only poor KEK
[0:57:03] kazumadez: Heaters and drying racks
[0:57:04] the_brandolorian: once Geega finishes the spreadsheets, money will be so much easier to track
[0:57:05] Auruanix: furniture is very expensive
[0:57:06] ktothec99: Harry has the biggest money sink with growing honestly
[0:57:10] kainashiCZ: weed money go to weed again - reinvest in seeds, fertilizer etc
[0:57:13] Arujon: and the upcoming electricity bill KEKW
[0:57:14] mantarala: Weed just making recently, prev was for rep, no?
[0:57:19] midwest_dad: Weed money has just been reinvested to grow, more racks, heating, fans, etc
[0:57:20] sshinn7: Bro watched harrys stream. Money is everywhere in the house 😂
[0:57:25] therepoman77: A lot of money going back into the process would be my guess
[0:57:27] OWBallaz: and the rep is at max to
[0:57:28] ROFLobster: Isn't there a new business with the washed money? the Jewelry thing Harry was doing
[0:57:30] jstnbrt: Octo running weed was prime contant
[0:57:32] ktothec99: It's leading to some cool stuff thankfully
[0:57:32] kainashiCZ: Speedy is close to 100 rep with the turf guy
[0:57:39] lucidious_fox: The issue might be washing takes a lot of time from washing machine and then needs to be cleaned. After that the money has to be distributed between grower seller and cleaner
[0:57:42] bird24287: rep seems to be the unlock in 4.0
[0:57:43] fambaa: weed barely pays for whatever reason its pretty stupid
[0:57:46] pecannepie: but rep leads to money and stuff
[0:57:46] sandip38j: G6
[0:57:49] Auruanix: weed had a 2 months build up for comfortable profits
[0:57:49] midwest_dad: Now that those are bought, then you can start building profit
[0:57:51] mantarala: Rep opens new crime = money
[0:57:53] AK1N0M_: what would you do?
[0:57:55] Mz_fit: Just be yunos driver for g6
[0:57:56] FairlyFunnyFelineFriend: wait till you can sell the packer maybe?
[0:57:58] kentripp: is wasing money not making money?
[0:58:01] NoQox: once robberies come out
[0:58:03] ishouldprobably: the rep correlates to the weed sales/prices it's assumed
[0:58:04] renimation: this is the first step, the money making part is yet to come. besides weed already makes money they just buying shit ton of stuff with it
[0:58:11] Mz_fit: He's a passenger princess
[0:58:11] goju_pampin: are u waiting for yuno?
[0:58:11] sarahm9889: it doesn't pay to do crime right now
[0:58:13] AK1N0M_: if the pay isnt a factor what job would u like to grind
[0:58:13] sandip38j: T3T3  makes
[0:58:15] argonize: progression basically
[0:58:19] HighToker: anyway to get kitty to help with chop if your the driver
[0:58:19] jstnbrt: They broke from all the wafflin
[0:58:20] iLLuSi0NN: Its all to make criminals be smarter and not just run around and be stupid coz they make tons of money
[0:58:20] reichenbachs: progression
[0:58:22] Lunalynn4: Slowburn bby
[0:58:24] unIuko: at the end it all be worth it COPIUM
[0:58:25] MintRiver11: yeah crime do no money
[0:58:25] BerzerkHitzDiff: money sinks KEKW
[0:58:27] Jahnuuu: BOOSTIN
[0:58:29] pecannepie: thats why u need to build up rep with chopping first THEN it makes you money
[0:58:31] Prebija: get high rep then something opens and you game
[0:58:31] ty_136: @Mz_fit actually this LUL
[0:58:32] therepoman77: All about the unlocks
[0:58:33] ROFLobster: It's just assumed at this point that you will need people maxed out with all the different reps to pull off heists etc
[0:58:35] JediMiMi: @neutren do sanitation. you’ll get paid and at first but you also can sell mats to Buddha and that will make up for it.
[0:58:37] its_neal: offline yuno?
[0:58:37] wolfw33: Lang is rich he got almost 200k in the bank
[0:58:40] GlitchyByte: for rep, with the idea that something will come up later that will make money and people will be ready then
[0:58:41] kazumadez: Slowburn build up
[0:58:46] Auruanix: slowburn progression
[0:58:48] bird24287: first you get the rep then you get the money then you get the power
[0:58:49] reichenbachs: main money is mats
[0:58:51] qatherine__: buffing crime would encourage crime tho. the police presense rn is so weak i think its only fair that crimes are not too rewarding
[0:58:54] fambaa: tow I think goes up to 500 stars and at the end are the lockpick and crowbar BPs
[0:58:56] trankesdello: need to ask treasurer PepeLa
[0:58:56] Fate_Amenable_To_Change: chopping apparently gives quite a bit now
[0:58:58] ktothec99: Harry only has money because he's been no-lifing sanitation. Even then he's not even up that good
[0:59:00] Donut3venTryMe: !playlist
[0:59:00] Nightbot: Neutren's playlist can be found here: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6NJyGitwXwOHhoxAZoQOiK
[0:59:01] sshinn7: Civs job really be paying very much
[0:59:04] iLLuSi0NN: Lang does 6hr a day sanitation
[0:59:08] the_brandolorian: it seems like the new pawnshop system makes double what weed does… so maybe the real money comes in when house robberies are a thing?
[0:59:08] Mz_fit: I'm really surprised that in the one day the g6 truck was manual that yuno didn't blow up his vehicle
[0:59:08] Fugeki: once the unlocks happen it will change for sure but imagine getting caught with your pants down not being able to do x because they didn’t do rep
[0:59:11] hngryghozt: when are the crime apps gonna open up?
[0:59:12] lucidious_fox: There is weekly dues + computer sales + weed sales
[0:59:13] aVertigo91: Crime will probably be profit once you get enough rep and they unlock stuff
[0:59:14] ShreddedFPS: in 3.0 everybody needed materials when businesses was open
[0:59:15] joshbankai: Just go the Harry route, 300 Sani, 100 growing, 100 fence, and 100 PD calling rep Kappa
[0:59:24] mantarala: Materials shld be lang personal hustle no?
[0:59:26] sandip38j: he makes ton from mats
[0:59:28] Auruanix: sani pays shit
[0:59:29] ktothec99: Speedy, Yuno, and Lang's hustles honestly probably the most lucrative
[0:59:29] fambaa: washing money also has rep
[0:59:30] unIuko: @joshbankai harry with a god build
[0:59:30] OWBallaz: yeah but the house stuff is a lot of money to, like the boxes and wood is very expensive
[0:59:32] aahribaa: i think only luciano and tony are down bad
[0:59:35] docmabuut: Maybe each job will have a crim advantage, G6 might have bank robberies and grime might have trafficking
[0:59:36] seedsu: im like 90% sure this is why gigi is making like a proper spreadsheet for it KEKW
[0:59:40] iLLuSi0NN: @the_brandolorian there wont be one. House robberu be other players prob
[0:59:41] mimmakata: money making feels monotone and everyone goes slowly crazier KEKW
[0:59:49] bird24287: @joshbankai Harry gotta be the biggest star collector in the city
[0:59:50] jstnbrt: Pocket watch Lang went well fir Harry yesterday
[0:59:55] mannyziumXO: our delays alerted nodd
[0:59:58] Shad0w_wizard: geega is working on a spreadsheet for some stuff as well as some logistics stuff so hopefully shit will become more clear where money is going

[1:00:15] mimmakata: Statistics
[1:00:16] iLLuSi0NN: All the money gets reinvested basically
[1:00:17] pecannepie: just ask arush lol
[1:00:19] fambaa: I bet Tony will press Gigi to delete some debt of his and add money he paid KEKW
[1:00:21] ishouldprobably: it seems at this early in the server the point is crime pay vs civ pay is unbalanced to form a real economy before everyone thinks theyre outlaws
[1:00:22] kazumadez: Lang makes alot but he also spends alot of his own money for progression
[1:00:24] OWBallaz: yeah
[1:00:25] Mz_fit: Most of the profits come from materials and computer division
[1:00:25] NoQox: is octo the only non-don that paid for the house?
[1:00:31] reichenbachs: @NoQox, ye
[1:00:33] Perplexed_za: @NoQox YAP
[1:00:36] Landarokz: I think Monday is gonna be the profit distribution day. If you kicked butt in the week, probably get a bonus/deby forgiven.
[1:00:42] FairlyFunnyFelineFriend: profits are about .5-2 bucks/material
[1:00:43] chillsley16: I think that’s a fair question for Friday. like Speedy should be bringing financial info to those meetings.
[1:00:45] HighToker: crim not much profit
[1:00:48] jim530d: @NoQox yea thats kinda weird
[1:00:50] sshinn7: I think u can ask arush separately!  He is chil
[1:00:53] Mz_fit: Weed makes very lil profit compared to cost
[1:00:55] hngryghozt: the computer business crashed overnight
[1:00:56] the_brandolorian: geega’s spreadsheet will be very eye opening. gonna show exactly what each job makes, and have an efficiency rating per source of income if I understood correctly
[1:00:59] sulos22: @fambaa Tony is going to show gig the maid outfit and probably kill gigi from laughter
[1:01:00] ROFLobster: I think they're saving up for new ventures that pop up
[1:01:02] OWBallaz: electric bill and tax is incoming to
[1:01:15] iLLuSi0NN: You guys prob have the most advanced house with company
[1:01:17] FairlyFunnyFelineFriend: it's 8 PM!
[1:01:17] Landarokz: Yeah, Geega with the spreadsheets will show more profit info I bet
[1:01:19] trankesdello: weird thing is octo also paid for the house
[1:01:24] HighToker: computers probably around 100k along
[1:01:27] charlythedevil: They are not profits right now, just a slow investment for a good future
[1:01:27] Fugeki: as far as crim stuff it’s all for non profit for everything gets put in the house from what I’ve seen the personal money from people comes from civ jobs
[1:01:29] Firepokachu: in washing machines alone it’s like 30k right which seems crazy
[1:01:29] Auruanix: it's all used to invest in everything that's in the house
[1:01:31] WickedMrE: Setting stuff up is expensive
[1:01:34] kazumadez: @owballaz they paid their tax its just the powerbill now
[1:01:34] fambaa: yeah the pc stuff and the power gives the butc and who knows what that unlocks
[1:01:37] abz1924: is it late enough for chop or does it need to be dark
[1:01:39] ktothec99: Lang and Harry were paying out of pocket for a lot of it until recently
[1:01:39] kentripp: could do a company health report once in a while so people can know state of all the work they put in
[1:01:45] mantarala: If you didnt by cars, are u the richest in the crew?
[1:01:48] Mz_fit: The computer market has crashed but the next big thing will cost butc and it will go back up
[1:01:48] Bigjoker66: Gigi saw Tony's outfit last night

[1:02:14] Bigjoker66: Tony's
[1:02:16] kentripp: i feel like if youre paying weekly dues, you're owed some info
[1:02:16] iwr1techky12: Tony has nobody to blame but himself though lol
[1:02:17] charlythedevil: The group is Still growing and investing in all their bussiness,  so is difficult to see some money haha
[1:02:22] the_brandolorian: octo is definitely the most efficient at making money right now
[1:02:23] Tiilde: currently  everything outside of materials and computers, its a grind to figure out the end and hopefully there is an unlock
[1:02:24] Shad0w_wizard: @Bigjoker66 damn I missed it
[1:02:26] awesomephilip11: Have you tried the pawnshop part?
[1:02:26] iLLuSi0NN: Its fine
[1:02:35] KumiXIV: splitting rep definitely isn't ideal too
[1:02:37] Mz_fit: Most likely robberies will be the next big job unlocked
[1:02:39] NorthWestDork: You and Tony should just be the dedicated money cleaners
[1:02:42] pecannepie: it does pay lol
[1:02:46] legion0222: Gotta work out a cut with the boys imo
[1:02:51] ktothec99: Harry getting fence rep so quickly was so funny and different from how most people did it
[1:02:51] Bigjoker66: Just after storm
[1:02:52] pecannepie: it helps the group and the group pays out?
[1:02:54] goju_pampin: its part of the process
[1:02:55] OWBallaz: but your progress in general is very good, it is a shame that there is no love for racers right now
[1:02:55] eckotips42: It pays clean bills
[1:02:56] fambaa: why would there be rep if there is no benefit to it
[1:02:56] iwr1techky12: It does pay, they just need to kick the money back to you
[1:02:57] ty_136: charge em a service fee for cleaning Clueless
[1:03:00] zweii22: pays gold stars lol
[1:03:05] mokkakop: its not about the money tho but gold stars
[1:03:05] bird24287: pays in experience lol

[1:03:07] reichenbachs: gold stars KEKW
[1:03:07] DrizzleLolz: someone needs to clean all the dirty money from weed
[1:03:08] GlitchyByte: chat pepega

[2:45:23] KetheonZ: Anyone know how much t3 grime gives?
[2:45:47] KetheonZ: @ketsu93 yeah before Yuno Mule  technology was abused
[2:46:04] KetheonZ: Basically G6 T3 got nerf cause of Yuno
[2:46:19] KetheonZ: He was Double dipping t3 runs left and right
[2:46:25] cup_cakee: cup_cakee subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months, currently on a 2 month streak! 
[2:46:31] ketsu93: @KetheonZ that's busted, 4k each for 25 minutes of work if you do 2 big runs
[2:47:01] KetheonZ: @ketsu93 he did more than 2 runs..... Lets say he did 4-5 big truck runs
[2:47:13] KetheonZ: Thats why Yuno is rich LUL LUL
[2:47:53] ketsu93: so you can make 12k each with 75 minutes of work hours of work, just gotta be in the city for like 10 hours to wait for the cooldown
[2:48:00] KetheonZ: Yuno if he see someone with t3 truck he goes "Here's my number call me"
