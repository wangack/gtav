[1:35:45] John_Goodhorse: "The widespread popularity of chalupas across Mexico has also influenced Mexican-style restaurant fare in the neighboring United States. Among notable examples in the US are fast-food versions, which, unlike its Mexican namesake, are fried tortilla shells topped with multiple ingredients. A thicker tortilla shell and multiple toppings have more in common with Navajo frybread and the use of frybread as the basis for a taco than the traditional savory chalupa found in Mexico. D"
