[3:20:08] itsjustasummerjob: Ahh makes sense
[3:20:10] ImTooOldForThisShit: @deathfrombelow7707 agreed
[3:20:13] doc_sharon: gonna have to do it by train schedule Yesyes

[3:21:10] A_Humble_Wooper: SCIENCE
[3:21:20] itsjustasummerjob: Gotta re-science to confirm
[3:21:47] itsjustasummerjob: Sciencing takes lots of testing

[3:22:24] aideenx98: A direction!
[3:22:29] Kthanid: A solid hypothesis.
[3:22:30] itsjustasummerjob: Oh no I’m not trying to shit on what you have!! I’m just saying I’m excited to get Wade in there to see it <3
[3:22:33] dankgreenflame: yeah, first go-round was enough was enough to draft a solid hypothesis to test
[3:22:38] A_Humble_Wooper: Theories can be adapted or disproven as more info gets added.

[3:22:57] AshuraX13: She's pretty cool guy
[3:23:01] itsjustasummerjob: Since he spends the most time pushing (because prio)
[3:23:37] mikfoolery: @itsjustasummerjob and sheer ability to stand in one spot for 5 hours without wanting to perma
[3:23:51] doc_sharon: hi @mikfoolery katesWave
[3:23:54] itsjustasummerjob: See, I know I’d be good at pushing because I can do the exact same thing
[3:23:55] mikfoolery: 👀 info
[3:24:05] itsjustasummerjob: I have no issue just standing and grinding
[3:24:06] mikfoolery: @doc_sharon katesWave

[3:24:26] Insaif: Just gotta get to 100 rep with the lower push, right>
[3:24:27] Insaif: ?
[3:24:33] mikfoolery: if i had prio i wouldnt mind standing and grinding but having limited server time makes 5 hours standing in the desert alone v sadge foolsSmoge
[3:24:33] itsjustasummerjob: But I don’t mind being a grower, especially because it doesn’t make safety sense for Lane to push
[3:24:42] itsjustasummerjob: True Mik
[3:24:50] Trexlor: very important chat
[3:24:51] Insaif: With the higher rep strain, it should take no time at all.
[3:24:57] hecktobreakfast: oop
[3:25:14] AshuraX13: Sounds familiar
[3:25:16] itsjustasummerjob: Yeah I think pushing Pit then Maxx could get to 100% in like 8-9 runs

[9:00:14] AziraphalesShop: My favorite cheesecake doesn't exist anymore, and I still get cravings for it.
[9:00:22] sharingiskaren: is cheesecake a pie or a cake?
[9:00:32] AziraphalesShop: It's a pie
[9:00:38] DirectorStephanie: Kate at the Asian grocer: One of each dessert please.
[9:00:38] slmyrick: there’s a new Asian market that opened with a whole Asian bakery with the cloud bread and all. soooo excited!
[9:00:41] if0rg0t2remember: yeah its a pie for sure
[9:00:41] DirectorStephanie: Grocer: Ma'am?
[9:00:46] DirectorStephanie: Kate: I said what I said.
[9:00:50] hanofearl: it’s bc Japanese pastry and sweets have so much less sugar in them. it is more of an appreciation of all the ingredients
[9:00:58] jedi_raccoon: Cheesecake Factory Yes
[9:01:03] jedi_raccoon: agree
[9:01:12] Insaif: Yeah, CF is choice overload.

[9:02:38] caitriamorrigan: I thought you specifically explained to her not to
[9:02:40] tommyguns365o: now a hard question is syrup overpowering

[9:03:31] nerdy416: 100%
[9:03:31] flathaed: agreed
[9:03:36] slmyrick: my mom only eats the interior part of her pancakes and DROWNS it in strawberry syrup. I gag a little every time I see it.
[9:03:36] Symbiotic1: fake maple syrup depends on the brand for sure
[9:03:39] eddieatthegov: @tommyguns365o no, because I can actually control it.
[9:03:41] AziraphalesShop: I always prefer the real stuff
[9:03:44] doc_sharon: I like the fake syrup, but not alot of it NODDERS
[9:03:45] A_Humble_Wooper: If you put as much real maple syrup on pancakes, as you'd do the fake stuff, I can see it being overpowering. The real stuff is STRONG.
[9:03:45] if0rg0t2remember: I am old enough that I remember when IHOP had like 7 types of syrups on the tables
[9:03:48] KarnEvil: I can't stand the fake syrup. gives me a weird aftertaste.  I'll take the real syrup.

[11:49:13] itsjustasummerjob: YUP
[11:49:14] Kthanid: Nancy and Collin, so cringe.
[11:49:14] sharingiskaren: imagine asking Maxx for relationship advice though
[11:49:16] if0rg0t2remember: yeah at least Nancy and Collin were just an old Lesbian couple
[11:49:20] Hoocairz: I mean, I'm totally fine telling another person nice things, but someone does the me to me? Huge ick.
[11:49:29] itsjustasummerjob: Bunny was so smitten and I had so much relationship / feelings RP
[11:49:31] Rootbreaker: I’m reminded of Nancy’s attitude towards Kian
[11:49:35] itsjustasummerjob: Now it is NO feelings
[11:49:46] doc_sharon: Once people couple up, it gets boring katesGiggles
[11:50:02] Hoocairz: ^
[11:50:03] Nightbot: ^
[11:50:05] jedi_raccoon: I miss the Collin and Nance days lol
[11:50:07] Jorsh029: Bunny and Sexton's relationship literally defies destiny itsjusBunblush
[11:50:24] IchibaToll: To bust out the old SAT analogy, it seems like maybe romance RP for Bunny is to Summer as meeting RP for Nancy is to Kate.  "I've had enough of that for a while, thank you."
[11:50:24] Hoocairz: I mean, I will say nick and v are the exception when it comes to relationships
[11:50:31] itsjustasummerjob: Truthfully that’s the reason I’m not pursuing relationship RP - because once the couple gets together, the movie ends. It’s the least interesting part of a relationship. There has to be turmoil for it to be fun.
[11:50:38] Hoocairz: But I feel like nick is super cute.
[11:50:56] itsjustasummerjob: True but Nick and V have a lot of external drama that keeps their relationship from feeling boring.
[11:51:00] AshuraX13: They can get spicy, but work it out pretty quickly
[11:51:00] Kthanid: Yeah they're probably the most stable relationship in 4.0 right now.
[11:51:03] jedi_raccoon: I do like Nick and V
[11:51:24] Kthanid: They have Michael, Jenny, Dahlia etc
[11:51:28] doc_sharon: the most drama they have right now is when will he propose
[11:51:31] Hoocairz: And he regularly fucks things up enough. And you two bounce off each other so well in rp.
[11:51:36] doc_sharon: between each other, that is
[11:51:38] NoharTheShark: nancy and collin were pretty much the same...they were each other's only bit of sanity
[11:51:38] sharingiskaren: imo external drama is more interesting than romance drama anyway
[11:51:40] itsjustasummerjob: Like, it’s the reason that I pursued the Edgar stuff so hard at the end of 3.0. Because I hadn’t been playing Bunny *because* it was so stable.
[11:51:40] Hoocairz: Just small things
[11:52:08] itGlenn: KEKW
[11:52:12] Hoocairz: But he does a better job fixing them than just about any guy I've ever seen?
