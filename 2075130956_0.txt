[0:42:40] itz_IMAN: well mobo can’t erp on cop…
[0:42:57] fuzzyshoesuwu: Tbh its so grindy not many people wanna play both cop and crim.
[0:43:02] fuzzyshoesuwu: RIP Garcia
[0:43:09] ehzin81: better on crim then cop cuz cops policing themselves more then they do the ppl
[0:43:29] lucho724_: pd is trying to do it right this time and imo it’s maybe going a bit to slow and serious
[0:43:35] shanef8: Think there still a few on that onxs server
[0:43:40] fuzzyshoesuwu: No no other way around
[0:43:42] iraffis: Shift 3 is dead right now man
[0:43:46] YTnormalDude: @Silent they are lots of persons that want to be cops, but no starter class. there are people waiting month
[0:43:53] Maxverine: maybe not enough crime? hmjj
[0:44:00] itz_IMAN: @iraffis blame xice PepeW
[0:44:12] dunkrage: is there a spotify playlist
[0:44:22] brewticus: definitely cop besties fault
[0:44:24] xJPRRR: I mean, if cops arrests someone they get shit on KEKW
[0:44:39] xJPRRR: not wrong
[0:45:36] ArtemisRost: I know atleast 3 different POVs that wanna be cops but dont get recruited, and I dont watch a LOT of groups as well
[0:45:46] dripydryp: i been watching a fair bit of Kyle and onx isn’t much better in terms of grinding
[0:45:56] lucho724_: unfortunately I feel like shift 3-1 took a huge hit with everyone going to onx
[0:46:10] itz_IMAN: I think the main thing with cop is that they are trying to do it right so it’s a little to slow for some people
[0:46:13] ArtemisRost: I know of Alex River from G6 for 1 and a few other G6 workers
[0:46:26] lucho724_: Alex River fucked himself though
[0:46:33] HEGGA: ^
[0:46:33] aye_see: yah
[0:46:37] shanef8: You think there's not enough crime in EU and NA lot of crime and not enough cops
[0:46:39] lalacate: yep
[0:46:46] lucho724_: he literally brandished a weapon the day he got his gun
[0:46:47] ArtemisRost: oh KEKW
[0:46:59] brittybop: Ash also took Jenna in within the first week or 2, got positive feedback, and then nothing
[0:47:15] dripydryp: what i don’t get is that’s they haven’t introduced small crime yet like house robberies
[0:47:18] akhshitttt: 4head did a 1500 jewel run and there were no cops on him lmao

[0:47:37] lucho724_: @dripydryp they barely catches anyone now, more crime doesn’t help that
[0:47:55] akhshitttt: so EZ 18k
[0:48:10] dripydryp: @lucho724_ maybe they was more on duty with more pings going off
[0:48:30] lucho724_: it’s a weird spot. they want quality over quantity but it’s almost too slow now and there just aren’t enough ppl
[0:48:42] lucho724_: hired*
[0:48:57] Hypnovile: DinoDance
[0:48:59] akhshitttt: does robbing grime pay well?
[0:49:02] akhshitttt: like g6
[0:49:04] Krookd1: I think not allowing old cops to return hurt their numbers a bit
[0:49:12] lucho724_: agreed
[0:49:23] lucho724_: those cops would have at least been around daily
[0:49:28] Krookd1: Not every1 wants to start a new character after having 1 thats been around and established for years
[0:49:29] snake3y3ss: I feel like getting rid of Johnson cornwood n den was a mistake
[0:49:29] aye_see: not allowing old cops to return makes sense though because otherwise you end up with the exact same pd
[0:49:53] Krookd1: Yeah thats true. It just hurts in the beginning a lot
[0:49:55] lucho724_: firing 3 of the most active cops was also a choice
[0:49:58] s1mple4444: Pog
[0:49:59] kgenera: If they hired old cops, it would just be a mechanic update

[0:50:42] Chuc___: I havent seen anything of onx
[0:50:43] txc_menace: Isn't there a few cops that are in Mary's crew too
[0:50:46] ThatOneGuyDeny: oop
[0:50:49] lucho724_: can’t find a crim pov
[0:50:49] Tempah___: all I see is cops in circles
[0:50:50] brittybop: I'm all for a pd culture change or whatever they're trying to do, things just need to speed up a bit maybe?
[0:50:51] Krookd1: Idk, i watched onx for like a week then 4.0 came out
[0:50:52] ImStuxy: W
[0:50:58] shanef8: Like Wolfbella can't get on Nopixel I think. Pred I idk
[0:50:59] turntablist_mk2: cops just roleplay with other cops LUL
[0:51:08] snake3y3ss: yea seen a few clips here n there nothing to positive tho
[0:51:08] itz_IMAN: idk haven’t watched that server once
[0:51:10] dripydryp: myles nova
[0:51:11] liverpoolismycountry: cops love meetings
[0:51:21] Hypnovile: idk
[0:51:25] lucho724_: onx is mostly a cop stack from what I’ve seen with a few small chases here and there

[0:51:40] melandru_: he did a bit in the beginning but then switched over completly
[0:51:43] HEGGA: On Stubble
[0:51:44] lucho724_: Myles would be so good right now
[0:51:49] ss_dhillon: @smol_tsu sntWave
[0:51:53] Tempah___: myles character Harold is so funny man, he’s LT of their grape seed pd
[0:51:53] lucho724_: stubble was such a good motivator for pd
[0:52:03] haribohunter30: yeah he some reason didnt get cop but was in talks to run doc, but dipped to onx
[0:52:45] lucho724_: I feel like Stubble and Beric are prime for this PD and Ruby in NA is great
[0:52:56] shanef8: Like Jackie Snow. He had to make new character that start from beginning. He's leadership was so good
[0:53:41] dunkrage: What happened to olivia copper?
[0:53:53] fuzzyshoesuwu: Yeah I miss all the old Troopers they where awesome.

[6:08:51] Squidmyster: If they use there own money to set it up. Just let them.
[6:08:55] Calphalor: i mean the only reason for personal setups i can see is that you wont need to have to transfer btc from the mainfarm to the hackcomputer
[6:09:17] een1Z: Buttcoin is not illegal even if it's used for robbin shit
[6:09:44] lucho724_: you can buy drugs with money, doesn't make money illegal
[6:09:45] dirtyboyz09: if they seell mats they get paid once if they inv omn btc they sell that indefinitly no?
