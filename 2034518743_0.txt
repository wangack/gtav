[3:32:46] danxd209: I think we should do a car chase with Dundee with you.
[3:32:48] Kinson1: Whippy chat calls him Dylan. So then he said that if his chat can give him a nickname, he can give his chat a nickname, and said chat's name is no longer chat, it is now Tom .. So Tom has embraced it and that makes Dylan even madder.

[3:33:58] spiritking1987: I saw perfect spot but can't say it Waiting
[3:33:58] shadowvale81: whipBush bush gang
[3:34:13] danxd209: The fast and furious storyline in RP I love it! Keep it up Joshy
[3:34:13] Valroz: Shake your keys into the mic so dundee can hear if you want to troll him trust me
[3:34:17] Hitijahubessy: Lots of things he said are also used irl
[3:34:19] otterng: This shot looks cool
[3:34:52] Kesin86: That and not wearing your seat
[3:34:53] Kinson1: @Kesin86 No Pixel has also customized the tuning of all their cars. So a car in another server or even GTA Online will be completely different.
[3:34:59] master_vaja7: @otterng looks like hes abt to drop a album
[3:35:04] IamNumone: what happening chat dundee head pop?
[3:35:09] Kinson1: @shadowvale81 whipBush
[3:35:15] IamNumone: oh i see
[3:35:23] IamNumone: i thought eli crazy talking alone hahaha
[3:35:24] shadowvale81: One of the big things is just learning and driving around, find the little side routes and places you car can go easily
[3:35:26] Hitijahubessy: It’s amazing this game has such realistic driving physics
[3:35:28] IamNumone: we love dundeeee
[3:35:39] xxunicornxx99: Dundee is a great person
[3:35:43] spiritking1987: only took a few jailtimes to learn YEP
[3:35:44] IamNumone: manual such a good feature to install
[3:35:46] Kesin86: @kinson1 the hacking from 3.0 is different from what it is now, but it is still frowned upon to practice outside game.
[3:35:47] roman03110: irl racers actually look at the corners they take even if theyre far from it
[3:35:47] xCypha: you should see some of the cool things hes done in chases man Whippy is so underated as a driver in the city
[3:35:49] shimidon100: HELLO ELLUMM

[3:37:00] permittedsinge: That's why police have many offices on duty at least some of them are good
[3:37:08] otterng: I saw whippy play forza horizon the other day as well
[3:37:12] shimidon100: @xxunicornxx99 hope there are no problems and if there are find the positivity in that
[3:37:13] roman03110: cant believe he's teaching you this in depth, this is amazing
[3:37:31] AyrtonS8: Plus the pressure of having others in your car which could be a distraction
[3:37:33] TheJremyShow: Practice practice practice
[3:37:45] Kinson1: Every day is practice. And when you are getting chased by cops on the regular, you are always applying your knowledge and getting better.
[3:37:45] shadowvale81: This is one of the things whippy loves, he loves teaching new people
[3:37:49] xxunicornxx99: @shimidon100 I'm doing my best as much as I can luvv

[6:27:03] sigmund2121: Why not just practice more and wait for the car chase
[6:27:52] otterng: Maybe get rental when you wake up next time?
[6:27:58] zcdiacz: yeah especially if youre gonna go to bed soon might be better to do when eli first wakes up to still be able to use the rental... but guess you could sell it ?
