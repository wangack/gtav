[5:07:30] CohenTheBlue: Gladge

[5:08:02] Swiftym8: OMEGALAUGHING i hope if she fucks up they make you do it to her
[5:08:18] AzureCatalyst: @Swiftym8 I hate that this is a possibility
[5:08:30] Hento: what was that for?
[5:08:31] Archaius: did anyone ever talk to her after the talk you had with her on the beach OMEGALAUGHING
[5:08:31] Dwaely: Bloom did good
[5:08:34] one_two_x_you730: So no one still has talked to her?
[5:08:39] LetsGoPolice: still potential wow stream tonight og?
[5:08:47] Hento: oh was that myer?
[5:08:48] Archaius: lmao
[5:08:54] AzureCatalyst: @one_two_x_you730
[5:09:04] AzureCatalyst: Wait noone has talked with her after that whole debacle?
[5:09:07] AzureCatalyst: Sounds Nordic?
[5:09:10] ItsMeMattK: Meijer is a grocery chain based in Michigan
[5:09:12] GenericName1216: like the grocery store?
[5:09:14] Archaius: she must be so confused about this whole situation, poor mier
[5:09:17] TheRealGunbeard: I think its dutch
[5:09:18] czeksmyx: imagine anyone actually learning from drama
[5:09:19] Swiftym8: i mean they probably dont wanna touch it anymore
[5:09:20] Dwaely: That's insane
[5:09:23] michaael_g: Meijer is dutch origin
[5:09:24] Hento: you tanked 100% aggro
[5:09:26] Hento: good job
[5:09:26] gorby14: apologize now ReallyMad
[5:09:28] AzureCatalyst: Meijer is a Dutch Surname apparently
[5:09:31] Swiftym8: kinda thew a spanner in the works

[5:09:55] Crosis86: what spec were you playing
[5:09:55] ks_time: same
[5:10:00] Hento: single target you gotta pool energy for single target right?
[5:10:04] Hento: I had that problem with feral
[5:10:07] LetsGoPolice: eh no worries either way. always other nights
[5:10:07] Crosis86: cause mutilate is where its at now moose
[5:10:11] M0neymarvin: i played rogue for the first phase and it felt awful compared to others, like my second time playing wow too
[5:10:16] bizmoa: IM
[5:10:19] Hento: you might be trying to do too much
[5:10:39] bizmoa: H

[5:11:12] gdfunky: Blap this Sussy
[5:11:13] Crosis86: are you talking about retail or sod?
[5:11:22] Hento: double check, cause I was doing too much shit as feral with my energy pool, and when I actually slowed down it skyrocketed
[5:11:26] sabsterrrr: Idk if I should get into wow now or wait till next expansion
[5:11:26] Crosis86: ohhhh
[5:11:39] AzureCatalyst: This deliberation is taking a while. We're getting Berry rights aren't we PEPW
[5:11:41] Crosis86: SoDs cool but idk
[5:11:42] Hento: compare logs
[5:11:47] Crosis86: i wanna play but im bored
[5:11:48] bizmoa: expand this
[5:11:48] goodnightjayrod: Every time I think of rogue, I think of the shots song but DoTs instead
[5:11:54] avriick: people are just being too sweaty in SoD
[5:11:56] Hento: oh yea
[5:12:09] Hento: set prob changes rotation lol
[5:12:10] Crosis86: they banned gdkp in sod
[5:12:14] theemeaty: you def should you have so many charges rn
[5:12:15] bizmoa: compare this
[5:12:21] Hento: that still might
[5:12:26] itsbubbzi: You have like 8 charges so think its worth
[5:12:27] mercifullrs: Still in court?
[5:12:28] czeksmyx: it's easy to be sweaty in SoD because it's so basic and you have a lot of time
[5:12:32] theemeaty: 31?
[5:13:08] Hento: that might change opener?
[5:13:09] Hento: I donno
[5:13:14] fuuhhzz: mbroDumpy_SG
[5:13:18] AzureCatalyst: Also circling back to the Graycen hate. All my homies hate him because he keeps getting my RP and Variety streamers to paly Retail WoW again and I cannot watch people play retail anymore
[5:13:27] Swiftym8: cant wait till the sheriff shoots you
[5:14:29] Hento: I love you called it
[5:14:35] Crosis86: hes prob thinking about the reports more then miranda
[5:14:43] Hento: bench trial should NOT set such an important thing
[5:14:52] AzureCatalyst: If you get Berry rights. I hope you get roasted during the next PD meeting for this
[5:15:16] ThousandEyesAnd1: misstating the radar was wild too
[5:15:18] AzureCatalyst: Nah just send every crim on a 24 hour hold while you fill out the paperwork
[5:15:19] Hento: yup call em to court
[5:15:20] Crosis86: then theyll really cry
[5:15:26] lloggiczz: just put warrants on them let them walk 5 feet and grab them up
[5:15:27] AzureCatalyst: EZ Clap Pentagaming EZ Clap
[5:15:33] Archaius: honestly imo they should get a bar complaint for basicly completly hijacking this mans case to push for legislation in their own interest @Moosebrother
[5:15:33] bugginpuppies: that’ll be funny judges would hate bloom
[5:15:41] ItsMeMattK: @AzureCatalyst, they can actually hold for 72
[5:15:47] Hento: why have discovery then
[5:16:04] AzureCatalyst: @ItsMeMattK 72 hour hold is rough for a traffic ticket
[5:16:11] Gadn: You want a lawyer? Okay, gotta hold you for 24 hours then to fill out the report
[5:16:12] TheColorGreeg: they literally offered no defense
[5:16:12] StreamElements: Can't get enough Moose? Check out the YouTube VOD archive at https://youtube.com/@Moosebrother for Classic Roleplay and Variety Streams, archived by your favorite mod ChiDorky
[5:16:15] Hento: I mean if they get found guilty you should put a bar complaint that they did not defend them yourself
[5:16:29] early_retirement: u would have to provide MDWs to non lawyers too, sounds like a headache
[5:16:31] tigerpapa9: if they want reports in the cells then they can wait for the report to be done. all 72 hours of it.
[5:16:39] ItsMeMattK: The only way to get that changed is to actually do it.
[5:16:41] Hento: yup
[5:16:56] Hento: every rosa case
[5:17:07] Swiftym8: how many more trials do you reckon lawyers try to establish miranda rights at? i feel like its not gonna stop OMEGALAUGHING
[5:17:13] Hento: that will be done in 24 hours, see ya then and just send em lol
[5:17:13] Berkwild: Pierce gave lawyers a report early to show that he had 5 witness statements against their client, and they then double downed and still went to bench
[5:17:27] Hento: fuuuck it

[5:18:34] Swiftym8: CAUGHT it was me
[5:18:34] Kamtae: 100% accurate
[5:18:42] Benjamin18: LUL
[5:18:45] AzureCatalyst: LUL
[5:18:51] TrueRageRune: thats not true about nopixel, Croc was pushing for reports in the cells
[5:18:58] harriettheegg: LUL
[5:18:59] TrueRageRune: when he was doing his lawyer shit
[5:19:12] Chrian: yeah croc was also repeatedly disbarred though
[5:19:29] Hento: and fired as cop
[5:19:31] fuuhhzz: 🏄
[5:19:34] early_retirement: providing reports in cells could also give away witness identities
[5:19:40] MattRP: Chat what's the synopsis of this bench trial
[5:19:42] ThousandEyesAnd1: minecraft parkour
[5:19:43] theblazinwzn: i love subway surfers! #ad #subwaysurfers

[5:20:04] Hento: @MattRP Rosa wants miranda and to have reports shared in cells, she didnt put up anything else lol
[5:20:06] MattRP: Oh it died inside of you? That sounds... terrifying
[5:20:08] czeksmyx: Moose fact #243: Moose doesn't actually have internal organs, he's full of gumbo and dog hair.
[5:20:10] AerialAce94: pentawBeef rob a bank pussy
[5:20:12] TheColorGreeg: @Peachems_btw pentawBeef shoot a bank
[5:20:15] UltimateTurtle7: traffic ticket into 10 second chase into bench
[5:20:25] MattRP: Reports shared in the cells?! *SCOFF!*
[5:20:26] ItsMeMattK: Trial synopsys: RDM did nothing to defend the charges, but did ask the judge to legislate instand cell rep FOIA and Miranda
[5:20:27] klaatuNaatu: mbroVomit
[5:20:34] Bowes0: @czeksmyx Brought to life by the spirit of Mardi Gras nodd
[5:20:43] LtZetarn: And defense lawyer try to make it a Miranda rights and named it "Berry's rights"
[5:20:57] SamsonOption: court case: does a tackle count as A&B, is driver responsible for license plates if owner is present, miranda (who???) for a plea (LOL)
[5:20:59] BinchMcSwerve: usually your poop looks pretty pale i think
[5:21:07] czeksmyx: Oh, that's right. Moose also has weird Mardi Gras plastic babies floating in the gumbo and dog hair
[5:21:10] early_retirement: yeah they want it called Berry Rights too lol
[5:21:11] AzureCatalyst: @MattRP Riley and Bloom got tackled during an escape. They asked the criminal if they wanted to plead guilty in the cells. Defense Lawyers think you need miranda rights for asking for guilty pleas
[5:21:11] BinchMcSwerve: when your gall bladder isnt able to process fats
[5:21:21] UltimateTurtle7: HUH
[5:21:23] poehoy: and now moose has to go to the food bank because of medical debts Sadge
[5:21:30] mercifullrs: Dude gall bladders hurt. I've had a "gall bladder attack"

[5:21:57] Kamtae: sounds so fun
[5:22:05] skoadx: sounds like me with kidney stones
[5:22:10] Crosis86: they tried to remove my gall blader last year and then found out they made a mistake before they did
[5:22:12] Kamtae: hope youre beginning to feel better man
[5:22:13] Benjamin18: sounds awful
[5:22:17] craglyy: Like me with kidney stones
[5:22:23] Venkix: oof
[5:22:28] cackai2_: maybe you just had to poop and they stole your gallbladderr
[5:22:37] Slain0r: na healthcare KEKW
[5:22:38] AzureCatalyst: @MattRP I'm trying to be generous with them because I love Court RP, but if we get miranda rights from this case I'm going to riot
[5:22:38] klaatuNaatu: KEKW
[5:22:40] iGrim: lirikEat

[5:23:11] UltimateTurtle7: Primers modCheck gifters modCheck helpers with medical debt modCheck
[5:23:11] LetsGoPolice: remember when you ate *insert sponsor here* and got sick the next day?
[5:23:11] Crosis86: that shits miserable
[5:23:12] AerialAce94: that will be $50000 please
[5:23:13] iGrim: the doctor saw money bags
[5:23:37] Most_Palone1: The same thing just happened to my mom
[5:23:37] Crosis86: hospitals will drive you insane if youre there too long
[5:23:39] Amocoru: @AerialAce94 It won't be this low PEPW
[5:23:45] tigerpapa9: idk y the lawyers are trying so hard for miranda rights, everyone knows them and Bob wants them read anyways even tho nothign will happen if you don't.
[5:23:53] Archaius: murica is so fucked up for putting people in this situation
[5:23:55] Agosta44: -30k
[5:23:56] SirSaltyBacon: like a sniper scope
[5:23:58] SirSaltyBacon: what we talking about
[5:24:00] Kamtae: objection: scope
[5:24:04] Hento: washed

[5:24:11] VonWolfman: yep, my wife got all that, cost me... nothing...
[5:24:14] AerialAce94: computer is still adding zeros to the number
[5:24:14] Crosis86: oh god moose thats not good
[5:24:15] lucid_memes: should have gone to a sketchy doctor in mexico. could have sold a kidney to pay for the gallbladder surgery.
[5:24:16] Peachems_btw: Wonder if you mother is working with them
[5:24:18] RoboticRecycler: oop
[5:24:19] cackai2_: incoming 10k bill o7
[5:24:19] Crosis86: its gonna be very expensive
[5:24:19] LoopeeDK: no bill guess it was free EZ
[5:24:21] mercifullrs: Last time I had gall bladder problems they gave me a hefty morphine dose. It did nothing
[5:24:22] Agosta44: youll get the bill in a month or two when you forget about it
[5:24:23] BrazingCS: 1 million in debt....
[5:24:25] waxzR_: how much would that cost? that's crazy
[5:24:29] TheFdz: too big to calculate
[5:24:30] tigerpapa9: Don't worry they will bill you.
[5:24:31] Tear223: chat, please never be scared to go to the emergency room.
[5:24:34] swordofrahl: That takes like 3 months or more for a bill
[5:24:36] BinchMcSwerve: when i had a hospital bill with no insurance, they cut the bill in half
[5:24:44] waxzR_: That shit would've cost me almost nothing in germany because of public healthcare
[5:24:51] wazz3h: That is weird to me you get a bill for surgery or healthcare in general
[5:24:57] SmallSmoothBrain: Hope the hospital does a financial forgiveness program. If they take donations they mosy likely have it
[5:24:58] SpecialSyd: Despairge 27 this year, where does the time go
[5:25:00] Amocoru: My wife's appendectomy was about $60k and she didn't spend the night. RIP OG
[5:25:01] Slain0r: @waxzR_ yeah only 10€/day in a hospital
[5:25:04] Princeofiowa: lulWut sure, moose
[5:25:04] Arbal3st: When I had to get an ultra on my gallbladder, they told me I was fine. Then they came back an hour later and said actually it was extremely infected and I'm going to the OR in the morning
[5:25:05] MattRP: Oh yeah waiting for hours to sign up for health insurance is so fun, too!
[5:25:05] AerialAce94: sure...
[5:25:12] LetsGoPolice: also unfortunately liable tax wise too for lack of coverage
[5:25:13] ThousandEyesAnd1: @wazz3h we can’t tax people in the US
[5:25:14] Crosis86: @Moosebrother i went to the emergency room for a crohns flareup and i was there for 2 hours nothing done and they tried to charge me around 600 dollars so good luck
[5:25:15] aarontheking1313: Health insurance is great but you still get fucked
[5:25:20] Arbal3st: Turns out someone else was ALSO getting an ultra on their gallbadder
[5:25:24] wingedillidan: Can you get COBRA coverage?
[5:25:25] Hento: they ever tell you what the fuck can cause that Moose?
[5:25:33] czeksmyx: So this is your fault, you chose no car wreck over gallbladder Madge

[5:26:27] Amocoru: KEKW
[5:26:29] Furesis: it is crazy
[5:26:30] tigerpapa9: did trump do that or did congress do it while he was in office?

[5:47:31] Vikinick: Why not just stack regardless. Makes cell negotiations more interesting
[5:47:47] Tear223: i mean the defendants are probably more unhappy lol
[5:47:47] AzureCatalyst: can we file a bar complaint now?
[5:48:04] Swiftym8: ParasocialFrenn

[5:51:13] ItsMeMattK: Wild that a judge would hear the speeding go uncontested and not downgrade.
[5:51:47] Crosis86: the closing statements were the best
[5:51:59] one_two_x_you730: ONX is supposed to promote changing court approach in accordance with the judge. But not knowing which judge you are going to get makes it kind of hard
[5:52:28] Swiftym8: DinkDonk weems ready the mrpd transport
[5:52:46] Sieferifle: KEKW
[5:52:47] Crosis86: LOL

[5:52:58] Kamtae: sentence roulette poggSpin
[5:53:06] kman224: wait what?
[5:53:10] SBATenney1: this lawyer is gonna make his client get the full time lol
[5:53:13] Vikinick: I'm just confused that they think they won????
[5:53:15] kman224: your supposed to provide the defense's evidince?
[5:53:15] Crosis86: they cared more about the legislation attempts then the client
[5:53:22] cartert2212: these lawyers really want their clients to get full time lol
[5:53:27] Sieferifle: Do better
[5:53:35] AzureCatalyst: they spent the entire time trying to get Miranda rights and they are saying that shit?
[5:53:55] Sieferifle: and then told you to do a better job KEKW
[5:53:59] annie_bnannier: KEKW
[5:54:26] friggarn: BN just chilling

[5:54:52] Kaia_32: ROUNDABOUTING
[5:54:55] Kamtae: ROUNDABOUTING

[5:55:00] Hotot1: SKIP (reading)
[5:55:03] con_squared: irregardless shappiHW
[5:55:05] AmbulanceParty: ROUNDABOUTING
[5:55:17] Vikinick: you would be VERY surprised
[5:56:06] theblazinwzn: i learned it in a business law class
[5:56:07] Lurks_like_Gaston: This reminds me of the lawyers that got chewed out for citing made up ChatGPT cases
[5:56:07] Vikinick: I think basically every lawyer should
[5:56:17] Vikinick: because almost every single one of them deals with police reports
[5:56:25] Hento: god damn all these scouts
[5:56:51] AzureMarquis: who cares if they are happy
[5:57:43] kman224: you've teased with "do you know how miranda v arizona came about" and not said it I'm about to have to look it up myself
[5:58:43] Gadn: Really teasing him about how Miranda came to be?
[5:58:47] AzureMarquis: you should look it up
[5:58:49] AzureMarquis: it was fucked up
[5:58:49] Gadn: Stare
[5:59:05] AzureCatalyst: @kman224 the Miranda rights are giga fucjed from origin
[5:59:07] Scpoii: isn't it pretty ironic that the thing his lawyers failed on is what miranda's lawyer actually failed on too? focusing on rights vs actual guilt/innocence
[5:59:10] theblazinwzn: PEPW does he know
[5:59:25] AzureCatalyst: they pretty much questioned her for hours without a lawyer and forced a confession out of her
[5:59:52] ThousandEyesAnd1: montag plz
[5:59:58] Swiftym8: of course they are
[6:00:01] Hento: hmm

[6:00:36] AzureMarquis: I heard Nova is looking for another gf
[6:00:42] lloggiczz: if the bypass came in I wouldn't be surprised if pd just stared IDing and putting warrants out or someone work around because nobody wants to have to write a complete report in 30min to an hour
[6:01:02] AzureCatalyst: @azuremarquis when is she not looking for a gf lol

[6:02:31] AzureCatalyst: Iyep
[6:02:33] Hento: I mean I think most of us are, since we are RP sluts
[6:02:35] lucid_memes: ye she got a lot of d&d experience
[6:02:37] Vikinick: yeah but smite also lowers the cooldown of your holy word: chastise
[6:02:38] thestarsaredown: absolutely she is
[6:02:41] mpk5150: yep candii too
[6:02:41] AzureMarquis: as sad as it is she was huge in the arcadum dnd world
[6:02:43] Peachems_btw: thousands of hours of dnd
[6:02:46] skoadx: if you have to give them the report in the cells the processing time is going to be yuge
[6:02:47] CohenTheBlue: Momo is a dungeon master FeelsOkayMan
[6:02:49] LoopeeDK: people playing 5e cant call themselfs dnd nerd MadgeClapCute !
[6:02:52] AzureCatalyst: Momo played a ton of DnD with he who must not be named
[6:03:00] Amocoru: @LoopeeDK cringe
[6:03:01] Hento: No
[6:03:04] Swiftym8: DansGame gatekeeping

[6:03:15] Kiitzu: nah, 5e is fine
[6:03:16] thestarsaredown: any D&D is good D&D man
[6:03:16] LoopeeDK: i know people find it elitist PepeLaugh
[6:03:17] AzureMarquis: 5e is intro to dnd for a lot of people
[6:03:17] Peachems_btw: ban him
[6:03:19] Vikinick: I think 3.5 is the hipster choice
[6:03:20] Hento: boo this man
[6:03:21] deadbodyman: 5e is better
[6:03:24] one_two_x_you730: BOO
[6:03:27] LoopeeDK: i dont mind ill owe it EZ
[6:03:28] ThousandEyesAnd1: imagine taking the ability to lie in interrogation from pd
[6:03:30] lucid_memes: 5e is beginner friendly. oldhead gatekeepers gonna hate.
[6:03:34] Kei_L: Pathfinder 2e is better EZ
[6:03:46] m00ntruther: 🤓 up well actually to be an rpg nerd you have to play gurps
[6:03:50] AzureCatalyst: 5E isn’t perfect but it’s a decent enough entry point for people before they move onto other systems
[6:03:57] czeksmyx: Pathfinder 2e is...fine.
[6:04:02] Amocoru: NOPERS
[6:04:03] jensen808: no

[6:04:08] LoopeeDK: sry not english first language i actually thought it was owe it
[6:04:08] shibbytuxedo: no
[6:04:09] AzureCatalyst: pathfinder is fun but I cannot find groups for it
[6:04:09] Chrian: does it feel good going to hayes and not expecting to die
[6:04:09] exat1as: NOPERS
[6:04:10] LoopeeDK: NODDERS
[6:04:13] czeksmyx: 1st ed Pathfinder was fantastic
[6:04:15] Kiitzu: and soon, d&d next or d&d 1 or whatever they are calling it for their next rule book is pretty much a better 5e
[6:04:15] Swiftym8: holy shit calm down dude
[6:04:18] Swiftym8: ur still mad
[6:04:25] AzureCatalyst: calm down OG
[6:04:32] AzureCatalyst: your so angry right now OG
[6:04:32] exat1as: TAUNTED
[6:04:36] Hento: @Kiitzu its just the new core book coming out in september, it looks great
[6:04:37] gorby14: stay mad Point
[6:04:37] con_squared: mad again?
[6:04:38] LoopeeDK: @czeksmyx agreed and now look what i have made chat do PepeLaugh !
[6:04:41] Chrian: lesser included offenses Pog
[6:04:52] Swiftym8: ICANT just let it go dude its been like a week
[6:04:53] Hento: @Kiitzu check the last few unearthed arcanas
[6:04:57] AzureMarquis: @czeksmyx you mean 3.5 +
[6:04:58] LoopeeDK: @czeksmyx Chaos AngelThump !
[6:05:02] skoadx: i like judges not emending charges :)
[6:05:11] czeksmyx: @AzureMarquis I call it 3.75
[6:05:18] Vikinick: Just make them have to
[6:05:21] AzureCatalyst: did someone need a meeting with bloom or am I crazy?
[6:05:21] Vikinick: Just stack them
[6:05:22] m00ntruther: @czeksmyx personally i started out with pathfinder 1 so ill always have a soft spot, but 2e gets the job done i suppose
[6:05:29] czeksmyx: right, we know we're being trolled and we still cna't help it
[6:05:34] ThousandEyesAnd1: teach them why through rp
[6:05:37] Swiftym8: modCheck any patrol cops
[6:05:39] Seetherrr: I don't like amending charges, you argue against the charges presented then they get changed to stuff you didnt argue against
[6:05:40] ItsMeMattK: Lazy, and they dont think you'll actually do it to em when processing
[6:05:41] z3r0f14m3: its not just the not amending, its the same ol not on the same page where some judges want X when some want Y and you never know what youre gonna get
[6:05:43] Vikinick: Make judges lives miserable until they make their own lives less miserable
[6:05:46] thestarsaredown: @skoadx I think its good for docket cases but bad for bench, you dont have time at bench to take time to contemplate and review with your prosecutor at a bench so they should give leeway
[6:05:55] Chrian: I feel like not amending charges just encourages even more sweaty court shit
[6:05:56] LoopeeDK: @czeksmyx not so much troll as we all love to linge in the edition chaos FeelsAmazingMan
[6:06:02] AzureMarquis: @czeksmyx it really was just that
[6:06:05] LoopeeDK: linger*
[6:06:05] czeksmyx: I hate the multiclassing in Pathfinder 2. I've never played a single class in my life
[6:06:25] lloggiczz: yeah put 10 charges say I'll drop these 7 and then if they still want a trial all 10 are back to argue
[6:06:30] Swiftym8: its harold haroldsen
[6:06:31] con_squared: see you can tell he mad
[6:06:37] LoopeeDK: @czeksmyx i personally just really dont like 5e from a dm perspective NODDERS adv and disadv is a mess
[6:06:39] con_squared: s0upesCRYLAS
[6:06:40] AzureCatalyst: I’ve bought the Pathfinder 1e books and read them and don’t want to play 2e based off that info
[6:06:51] ItsMeMattK: arrrrold stooo erd wulls
[6:07:02] czeksmyx: Harold noises remind me of Freddie Price Sadge
[6:07:10] Hento: @LoopeeDK you would rather do a bunch of +2s and -2s that get forgoten about then brought up 4 turns later? lol
[6:07:13] AzureCatalyst: seems like a pain in the butt for newbies as a person who knows 5E inside and out
[6:07:34] AzureCatalyst: like 5E onboarding just seems so much fucking easier than pathfinder
[6:07:46] Hento: listen, we can all agree 4e was cool combat game, but DOGSHIT RPG
[6:08:00] Swiftym8: maaaaan this guy came back to the dmv to yell at the lawyers and the judge again
[6:08:01] m00ntruther: @Hento agreed
[6:08:02] AzureCatalyst: yooo 4e was dope
[6:08:06] AzureMarquis: 4e was MMO DND
[6:08:07] LoopeeDK: @Hento yes consistency is nice, and also i like that my dm's also get to be a "player" at the table nodd
[6:08:32] AzureMarquis: I played Dark Sun 4e
[6:08:34] AzureCatalyst: 4e streamlined so much of the dog shit old stuff of DnD but it didn’t feel like DnD to a lot of old heads
[6:08:36] Seetherrr: I think amending charges encourages pushing more serious charges because there is no downside to it if they just get amended to lesser charges
[6:08:47] AzureCatalyst: yooo Azure Dark Sun my mannnn
[6:08:52] Hento: @AzureCatalyst there was so much missing from the game when you were not on a battle map
[6:09:02] AzureMarquis: Dark sun is my favorite DND universe
[6:09:02] m00ntruther: now the real secret sauce is starfinder, its like pathfinder but slightly less bloated, in a very cool sci-fi world
[6:09:11] Crosis86: wtf am i hearing
[6:09:14] avriick: he is casting a spell
[6:09:16] avriick: with that word
[6:09:16] michaael_g: what is this bit
[6:09:16] czeksmyx: @AzureCatalyst That dogshit that got streamlined was the best part. The minutiae was great
[6:09:22] skoadx: reminded me of Dark Sun box set AD&D on cd rom
[6:09:29] one_two_x_you730: A potter
[6:09:33] Kei_L: 4e had broken math out the gate that had to be patched with the second PHB. Sadding But it was still lots of situational +1, +2 to keep track of at higher level. Still, it had EPIC tier with cool as fuck Epic Destinies poggSpin
[6:09:38] AzureCatalyst: 4e was designed with the VTT in mind and came out missing half the support it needed because the dev for that shit himself
[6:09:42] AzureCatalyst: shot*
[6:09:43] czeksmyx: @AzureMarquis the art for Darksun is what got me into D&D. That and Spelljammer
[6:09:49] lloggiczz: we stop using miranda, public start using the case law in this city that says the only question they have to answer is there name more or less
[6:09:52] Kei_L: They need to go back to lower HP levels though. HP is so bloated in modern D&D Sadge
[6:10:19] Hento: still there
[6:10:21] Hento: lol
[6:10:24] AzureCatalyst: I’m telling you fuckin situational modifiers and THACO are the bane of my existence
[6:10:28] czeksmyx: Too many Azures. Ya'll need to fight to the death Madge
[6:10:30] AzureMarquis: @czeksmyx Yeah, I just love the entirety of the universe. How it's all just a desert shit hole
[6:10:35] AzureMarquis: I gift more
[6:10:39] AzureMarquis: They need to change their name
[6:10:50] AzureMarquis: Imma call them Cat
[6:10:58] Seetherrr: @Kei_L i think hp got bloated because more casual players dont like dying and lower hp pools mean you are more likely to die to bad luck
[6:11:00] Kei_L: Like when a mage had 30-36 HP on average at level 20 in 2e and now they have 120+ in 5e shruggers
[6:11:01] AzureMarquis: I'm Azure they are Cat
[6:11:08] AzureCatalyst: I cannot be arsed to remember if I’m on higher ground or if he’s slightly soaked in water or if I’m facing the sun for a +2 to hit
[6:11:29] Hento: @AzureCatalyst TRUEEEE
[6:11:30] czeksmyx: that shit's great and I think it's easy to remember
[6:11:30] mercifullrs: Hes trying to take hat Carl's job
[6:11:41] LoopeeDK: @czeksmyx Darksun is sick! but I personally have a place in my heart for eberron FeelsAmazingMan
[6:11:52] AzureCatalyst: it just bogs down combat so much because there’s always another modifier you can account for
[6:11:54] czeksmyx: Fuckin Warforged Madge
[6:12:00] LoopeeDK: warforged is meh
[6:12:08] LoopeeDK: but the world lore in general is sick
[6:12:15] AzureCatalyst: like 4e and 5E you can just roll and see if you hit no fancy bullshit
[6:12:41] con_squared: sigh
[6:12:47] Kei_L: @Seetherrr Maybe they should have planned ahead and had contingency plans UltraMad
[6:12:50] czeksmyx: Pathfinder world lore is S tier
[6:13:23] Hento: he got lice man, dont touch em lol

[6:15:20] lloggiczz: what is that doctor doing I know going along with rp but if they just cheack him out he would /me what was going on
[6:15:27] con_squared: makes sense to me
[6:15:37] Suboptimal: Please doc you gotta help kermitGape
[6:15:44] Anhellzer: Q about to go crazy

[6:16:21] LoopeeDK: statue rp HUH
[6:16:25] GamonKills: "the statue" did not speak LUL
[6:16:34] lloggiczz: sounds like Q will be going off on a doctor to me
[6:16:39] Suboptimal: Doctor Aleks would have saved him
[6:16:51] con_squared: how old is the statue maybe there’s a loophole here shappiHW
[6:16:56] Erigzback: I love Bloom cracking down on stuff. I wish like 2 - 3 more people did it tbh.
[6:16:59] Hento: @Suboptimal truee
[6:17:05] Kiitzu: they're doctors, not architects pentawJs

[6:20:45] SBATenney1: They were two seconds away from getting let go lol
[6:20:49] Crosis86: wait the "Statue" has a cdl?
[6:20:55] shibbytuxedo: they couldn't shut up
[6:21:09] mellowtoaster: It was just fixed man
[6:21:16] Anhellzer: they need to learn when to shut up
[6:21:33] shibbytuxedo: but them not shutting up is still RP so its a win/win
[6:21:37] Seetherrr: @Crosis86 maybe he was a sanitation worker until he ran into a basilisk or beholder and became a statue
[6:21:38] Hento: @Anhellzer hey thats what miranda is for lol
[6:21:46] TheFdz: thats why they need miranda to remind them of the possibility of shutting up
[6:21:47] Anhellzer: haha
[6:22:06] Crosis86: rip hes gone
[6:22:07] mellowtoaster: Silence is your best friend with cops
[6:22:10] bugginpuppies: but that’s why no Miranda is so goatee @thefdz
[6:22:12] ThousandEyesAnd1: not being able to tell the difference between a statue and your dad is an interesting defense
[6:22:32] shibbytuxedo: it's a statue of his dad LUL
[6:22:44] ThousandEyesAnd1: still…
[6:22:55] Lurks_like_Gaston: Maybe he's a weeping angel

[6:23:16] AzureCatalyst: can’t believe that nash phone call was an hour ago. feels like 3 hours have passed
[6:23:26] mellowtoaster: Will a statue answer a phone?
[6:23:27] lloggiczz: gone back to being a statue can't answer the phone
[6:23:55] exotoxyn: work hours he's being a living statue

[6:34:19] Erigzback: Does anyone take Blame when Bloom brings something up? lol
[6:34:19] AzureCatalyst: holy fuck
[6:34:22] shibbytuxedo: broooo
[6:34:28] Hento: CID Pog
[6:34:28] AzureCatalyst: bro my brain hurts
[6:34:29] Seetherrr: "other peoples fucked up so my fuck is ok"
[6:34:30] Hotot1: That's bad tho, sure it happens
[6:34:39] Swiftym8: taking his anger from the lawyers out on cops Sadding
[6:34:42] SpecialSyd: ONEBADDAY
[6:34:43] generalatlas888: Bloom is gonna lose it
[6:34:48] Spikee439: Senior Lead BTW
[6:34:55] Crosis86: blooms joker moment
[6:34:55] schweird: I love watching bloom, reminds me of the backup quarterback on my highschool football team LUL
[6:35:00] Hento: you're the idiot here Bloom, clearly
[6:35:03] Birbado: hmm KEKW
[6:35:03] ItsMeMattK: HUGE detective moment
[6:35:06] Rem753: telephone actively effecting investigations
[6:35:08] Rem753: EZ
[6:35:10] XelanArdel: her excuse is 'they didnt ask" lol
[6:35:15] AzureCatalyst: this is our detective unit
[6:35:15] Seetherrr: Can you demote her from Senior Lead to Senior L? PEPW
[6:35:16] waxzR_: it's insane to me how many people just cannot admit they made a mistake
[6:35:36] LoopeeDK: how can people ask if they dont know to ask HUH
[6:35:37] leyonel__: kyle has to play pred more to get this detective unit in shape LUL
[6:35:44] Hento: @waxzR_ its something to do with being a cop
[6:36:10] leyonel__: cops not admitting their wrongs is some accurate rp tho
[6:36:11] Erigzback: @leyonel__ Agree with that. Not many people will confront people like this. Lol
[6:36:13] Am1shDude: Am1shDude subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 26 months, currently on a 16 month streak! yo
[6:36:15] Hento: @leyonel__ its done man, CID is fucking cooked
[6:36:36] AzureCatalyst: the problem isn’t that she won’t admit it’s wrong. it’s the fact that she genuinely doesn’t think it’s a mistake
[6:36:44] Hento: ever cop knows whats best, and most of them dont know shit
[6:36:46] Axiom462: LUL
[6:37:03] Seetherrr: @AzureCatalyst yeah, definitely the bigger issue
[6:37:45] AzureCatalyst: like the fact that the statement they got was I dunno what happened and she still thinks it’s on the random cop at the hospital is in the wrong for not asking for clarification
[6:37:47] Hento: and a victim could have easily been a suspect....
[6:37:47] waxzR_: @AzureCatalyst yeah but if a superior tells you it is wrong and you still remain adamant about doing it right, that's kinda crazy to me
[6:37:51] Hotot1: Statue? Y or N
[6:37:53] Hento: K
[6:38:08] Hento: naw
[6:38:13] Axiom462: she's a statue
[6:38:17] gorby14: bloom yelling at more women Sadding
[6:38:18] randomrpviewer: U right
[6:38:21] waxzR_: she was like "okay I guess" lmao
[6:38:21] Sieferifle: fire her then og
[6:38:24] Hento: detective :)
[6:38:29] michaael_g: I mean she’s prob been on duty for like 18 hours LUL
[6:38:36] kidflash717: why is the burden on the uninformed person to inform themselves and not the informed one to inform??
[6:38:39] AzureCatalyst: everytime I hear about ONX pd I get a migraine
[6:38:52] Axiom462: LUL
[6:38:52] Rem753: plain clothes cert :)
[6:38:53] AzureCatalyst: lol
[6:38:53] Birbado: KEKW
[6:38:55] JCGexp: lolol

[6:39:02] Sieferifle: LUL
[6:39:20] Hento: lotta good roleplayers in PD, not alot of good cops....
[6:39:28] AzureCatalyst: ^^^^
[6:39:30] Seetherrr: @AzureCatalyst I thought ONX PD was in terrible shape then I checked the reddit and it could be so much worse PEPW
[6:39:35] leyonel__: LUL
[6:39:38] Swiftym8: Yawn
[6:39:41] AzureCatalyst: I fucking love the RP from the PS
[6:39:46] Bowes0: Reddit Yawn
[6:39:49] AzureCatalyst: PD
[6:39:52] Hento: @Seetherrr The grass isnt always greener KEKW
[6:40:08] AzureCatalyst: but my god when there’s basic police procedure I just die
[6:40:29] Hento: "gimmie evidence you did something wrong or I will arrest you" nuff said lol
[6:40:35] shrinweck: moon2HUH <- patriot
[6:40:42] AzureCatalyst: That wasn’t even the worst thing from that
[6:40:50] SgtBonezz: I’ll take good PD RP’ers over effective RP cops any day
[6:40:54] AzureCatalyst: the fact that they perjured themselves for that after the fact
[6:41:01] AzureCatalyst: was mind blowing
[6:41:28] AzureCatalyst: legit just stick to your guns and just say you did that and get reprimanded for it after the fact
[6:41:49] AzureCatalyst: instead you perjure yourself for 150 dollar misdemeanoe
[6:42:11] Seetherrr: @AzureCatalyst I wasn't that surprised when blue hair answered the way he did, I was completely shocked when Burton did
[6:42:13] Gadn: @AzureCatalyst Its hard to remember things from a previous hour and then also remember if its a yes or no you should answer Sadge
[6:42:38] exat1as: Yawn SK
[6:42:47] AzureCatalyst: if I said you give me this evidence or I’ll arrest you that should be on your mind imo
[6:42:52] Hotot1: @seetherrr same
[6:42:59] AzureCatalyst: legit that’s why you are claiming to arrest
[6:43:00] lloggiczz: Well that's not how organs work but ok
[6:43:03] Gadn: @AzureCatalyst No. Yes. Ah, fuck
[6:43:12] SpecialSyd: @Seetherrr PEPW what did I miss
[6:43:17] AzureCatalyst: but that’s a moot point since we won’t get the court case ugh

[6:43:55] Hento: a slaughter house sure

[6:44:06] Lurks_like_Gaston: The ancient sanitary practice of Kali-Ma
[6:44:07] Crosis86: ok shes a trip
[6:44:17] AzureCatalyst: slash me eats your kidneys with fava beans
[6:44:25] Swiftym8: Madge fuck him

[6:44:48] AzureCatalyst: his damn wise guy
[6:44:56] LetsGoPolice: Sheriff L Bloom nodd
[6:45:31] Hento: cops can undeploy now? sick
[6:46:17] XelanArdel: just label it with a mysterious 2/3
[6:46:19] Seetherrr: @Hento it's looked like anyone can from what ive seen,
[6:46:32] Hento: @Seetherrr hmm donno how I feel bout that....
[6:46:42] AzureCatalyst: OH SHIT WE HAD THST STALKER COP
[6:46:52] AzureCatalyst: I completely forgot about that thing
[6:46:58] ChiDorky: BLOOM ! BLOOM ! HE'S OUR MAN ! VOTE HIM FOR SHERIFF, I KNOW YOU CAN !!!!!!!!!!
[6:47:00] rykoxd93: would not recommend labeling it if the person cant see the label
[6:47:06] Seetherrr: @Hento yeah idk if it's changed but a few weeks back i saw someone undeploy one so they could steal it
[6:47:07] Bowes0: BLOOM ! BLOOM ! HE'S OUR MAN ! VOTE HIM FOR SHERIFF, I KNOW YOU CAN !!!!!!!!!!
[6:47:07] AzureCatalyst: that report was Wild
[6:47:25] Hento: @Seetherrr did he lockpick it?
[6:47:41] Seetherrr: @Hento yeah, undeployed then lock picked
[6:47:49] exat1as: StareRun 📸

[6:49:29] Sieferifle: LUL
[6:49:46] newman_xd: PEPW
[6:49:51] Seetherrr: @Hento Certain people kind of need to be able to undeploy them without key access to enforce laws.  Since you can't legally deploy them in city limits and they can't be towed when deployed, there needs to be a way to put them back into vehicle mode.
[6:50:17] Hento: @Seetherrr cops/tow, and if you take the time to lock pick it seems fair
[6:50:24] Niksmc: he should've gone with the statue defense
[6:50:59] Hento: EZ Clap
[6:51:25] Rayvohs: thts cool tht frisking blurs out certain items
