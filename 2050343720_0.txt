[0:42:02] TimelessVagabond: @PENTA why not just tell them how you want it?
[0:42:03] RyuuBaka: The meters are just proof of payment.

[0:44:03] CuhMeez: I like feet more than meters anyways :)
[0:44:03] incomin_: to track the money
[0:44:04] Huso833: She's trying to figure out a way to bypass the meters so you still get the power
[0:44:04] Jonnen_: @PENTA it should be like the NPC at a restaurant
[0:44:06] Regular_Rex: its like you're a vallet but only for the meter instead of keys
[0:44:07] Bnooru: but do they actually put money on the meters or its just a proo ?
[0:44:07] TheJuiceLight: Proof is well and good but mechanics should not replace RP, they should either help to facilitate RP and interaction or involve something where there's no interaction. The only way they work is if you get a whitelisted job you can sign into to interract with those meters. If none on duty, the meters work on their own.

[0:44:52] Morrygu: upside it shows proof they paid or didn't. i guess otherwise they could just claim they alrdy paid?
[0:44:53] 543R05: @ChrisInDC which means if someone pays their own parking, a cop can arrest them for misuse of a meter
[0:44:53] GT_Alex74: To be honest, I think having to talk to a guy every single time you want to park would grow old pretty quick for most people. Slows a lot of other things down in front of such a high traffic area.
[0:44:54] Iseverheads: Parking heist
[0:44:55] slurmy: @PENTA they should make parking passes an item like how drivers licenses function but it shows what building they parked at, the time they got it, and what kind of car it is and only tow and dmv workers can issue it
