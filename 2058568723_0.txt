[6:37:25] TacoGS: Muddr is a twitch veteran
[6:37:28] Muddr: with it enabled, you can enter a phrase and it'll go back and ban them all based on it.

[6:40:03] sunstonefire: Yeah
[6:40:06] Baze_Ezra: Shieldmode is super useful. I've only had to fire it once in the channel I mod for, but it so much less work than going through hitting ban on everyone, then clearing chat eect.

[6:41:26] djihtrax: EZ
[6:42:20] bluejayjason: NOTED

[8:07:46] fugz2: @psychosnef did they tho? XD
[8:07:47] dreamquest1989: dont think that is the case here. once a pd officer pits a car at that speed. its intent is to make sure that that vehicle losses control.
[8:08:39] dreamquest1989: a very intersetin case. iff they sue and win this maybe some things wil be changed when it comes to pitting
[8:08:45] dreamquest1989: interesting
[8:08:59] fugz2: its hard one honestly half the factors deciding this will be firsts for laws in LS IMO just because i dont think negligence or anything is even considered yet lol
[8:10:27] fugz2: 100%
[8:10:38] fugz2: so much is going to be decided from this case
