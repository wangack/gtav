[6:24:04] CRlCK: @DANimalSTL it's just annoying a bunch of people asking about hal every stream. we don't delete it to be disrespectful to you but out of respect for her, sometimes it's overwhelming when people ask about hal this hal that in her own stream
[6:24:06] joebananas68: exactly
[6:24:08] Phasehero: He is playing Raia for negotiation tactic
[6:24:10] momzzyy: yeah but clay told him he had a dup of one color so
[6:24:12] krosswynd: u guys tell everyone everything
[6:24:13] eFiend: meta from call with raia 5min ago
[6:24:13] kablard: @BoJackJohnsson They need a leader.

[6:24:21] N3mEe: he knows
[6:24:21] momzzyy: yeah raia is shifting blame on clay
[6:24:21] cristina217: either way, what sealed the deal was raia calling him

[7:05:20] SpecialAgentSkye: @42arc I think she understands driving. The reason its hard to be a good driver on rp servers, is the way handling files completely changes brake distances, car velocities, turn radius, friction etc. Might be wrong though

[8:03:26] Karmas_Weapon: If it makes you feel better you guys weren't the target

[8:03:27] FRAlex010: omg
[8:03:29] Taxike: acieWADDLE acieWADDLE
[8:03:30] FRAlex010: for real
[8:03:31] teeeyy: There is a server rule which kylie looked up yesterday. You may not interfeere with another group heist when their heist has started.
[8:03:34] AquaBerryBackFist: you stood there and had your hands up
[8:03:35] SamuelUTD_: When he had the gun?
[8:03:40] 1iwill: I think you did. Anyone would be over it at that point. You rp'd like someone that was fed up with the bs
[8:03:41] SamuelUTD_: oh
[8:03:52] azurevein: your thinking way to much about that
[8:04:06] emrhys95: dont overthink it, it wasnt a big deal

[8:04:11] Rockhound__97: He was most likely... Wait she is ticked off, maybe not push it  :D
[8:04:12] Shikafrecko: it made sense for your character after all that happened
[8:04:13] bearderon: Can't interfere with other groups on a heist
[8:04:16] a_husky_: yeah server rules
[8:04:17] napkin4872: @Acie what would u haven done different then? i think it was ok
[8:04:17] IggleGreen: It happens
[8:04:17] andrefvm: Yes, they can't interfere with other groups heists
[8:04:18] x_amer__: its okay today was intense
[8:04:20] pilhass10: @teeeyy there are no server rules to x group lmao
[8:04:21] Daloo9: it’s all good
[8:04:22] Shikafrecko: only if the cops are involved they cant
[8:04:24] qihk: Yeah it happens
[8:04:25] RagoDK: You went back it was not a big deal
[8:04:25] MadHuskies: good thing u didnt do the heist there was so many cops chasing CG ur anxiety would go through the roof
[8:04:25] jonty1998: taking a l leads to good rp
[8:04:29] ruulqt: its server rules but the guy breaking the rule is the owner of server so.....
[8:04:30] AquaBerryBackFist: is jayzon wearing the bbl pants
[8:04:31] crazyiitopii: Even if you would have been able to do the job highly unlikely you walk out with a usb
[8:04:32] evilmoose__: It didn't look bad or weird from all perspective. Came off of you being shocked to see a gun.
[8:04:33] ruulqt: does it really matter
[8:04:33] SpecialAgentSkye: Your rp wasnt perfect, true, but given what Vee had just been through, it wasnt THAT bad.
[8:04:34] SaltiBanana: ya i think they broke the rule
[8:04:38] ZatashD: @teeeyy But wouldn't that be in place when Clay got attacked then?
[8:04:39] Acheron13: They made it a rule after there were 3 way gunfights over heists
[8:04:40] azurevein: it was good rp because you were actually done
[8:04:41] AquaBerryBackFist: it's server rules but he's the owner so om
[8:04:41] LaCucaracha7: i think it was fine tbh
[8:04:42] Rockhound__97: That in its self, is RP, cause you snapped :D
[8:04:42] fnaskdas: Only if the cops are already there I thought
[8:04:43] STONASESS: it's all good I think everyone lost patience at that point
[8:04:44] LOLanthony_: ironically yes it is server rules
[8:04:46] mavericks312: they don’t enforce that rule though
[8:04:50] justCoopp: youve only been doing rp for a month be easy on yourself dont beat yourself up @acie
[8:04:54] Crowz7: yea it was against the rules
[8:04:55] retarcl: should've said "shoot me please" om
[8:04:55] DylBKR: No one really abides by that rule though
[8:04:55] pokerguy18: no shot they penalize the server owner tho
[8:04:56] Karmas_Weapon: Does the heist start when the alarm goes off?
[8:04:57] sqdrager: it all comes with time
[8:04:59] boyboy242899: I saw Nunu in the hospital
[8:05:00] crazyiitopii: Ya someone tell x he is breaking his own server rule KEKW

[9:39:17] auxfrog: it ain’t that deep bruh
[9:39:18] glorfindel1111: true. it made good rp but if they're camping 24/7 how can anyone do heists?

[10:57:23] HandofOdd: coin will be earned back
[10:57:24] LluagorED: @lemonsANDlemurs I dont think they consider these "heists" like those back in the day. Or at least they havent told people to not bother them yet.

[10:57:55] FrOzInFeRnO: I'm a little surprised you haven't been robbed on sani runs yet
[10:57:56] fnaskdas: I don’t think any of the gangs wants to enforce that rule tbh
[10:57:59] piyuoo: She had a bad day chat. She isn't going to connect the dots with all the scenarios

[10:59:11] willowompoo: @addyadam who did?
[10:59:12] Marilyn_1020: it’s just sad that they would throw out friendship real quick just to please others
[10:59:14] Terrous10: @theace8869 the big gangs are literally speed running to get a full set, no one has all the colors
[10:59:14] mavericks312: @addyadam no you can’t rob a key or the house or you get banned
