[2:22:01] obscurewill: what's the second slot for in the washers anyway?
[2:22:02] zZannaH: buh
[2:22:05] EyeScraem: rainbow COPIUM
[2:22:07] RobMcFree: how ia it almost at half charge already lmao
[2:22:08] lemongrapel: TRUE
[2:22:09] KrisCat: @ForgetMidnight yeah, he's a little louder than usual
[2:22:10] SolidN: @taxthepoor2024 thats the other step they do that anyway
[2:22:13] jshwan: AllConnected
[2:22:17] TropicalToucan: martin now coping COPIUM
[2:22:17] bruHoran: @taxthepoor2024 don’t they get washed cash anyway?
[2:22:20] Xernique: Couldn't be nuthin
[2:22:23] postAmongUsist: daily COPIUM sesh
[2:22:23] iiidaaah: @taxthepoor2024 they thing they do is different. From Dirty to Washed is VU or washers. They do Washed to Clean money
[2:22:23] Westoffer: AllConnected
[2:22:24] Slizwun: LUL
[2:22:26] Yamagashi: rainbow road heist  FeelsStrongMan
[2:22:32] SolidN: @bruHoran  geegaNODDERS
[2:22:41] Slizwun: I swear Arush mentioned it to Lang and Harry in apartments a month ago
[2:22:42] DarthRadonis: Has marty talked to yuno already?
[2:22:51] ForgetMidnight: thanks chat SCHIZO
[2:22:56] AKOUTY: @Slizwun yep
[2:23:07] abz1924: @Slizwun ur not wrong lol
[2:23:10] bruHoran: @solidn geega has the best emotes I swear
[2:23:11] TropicalToucan: Need to get someone to grind it themselves that isnt the crews money
[2:23:14] kaivaIya: has harry confronted marty about his brazilian butt lift
[2:23:15] larrymt9: Lang ain’t gonna do it
[2:23:17] abc1121: "let lang know" ... "interesting" incoming PepeLaugh
[2:23:23] NickPenrhyn: @bruHoran geegaDab
[2:23:27] 1TrueTyrant: then just outvote him tomorrow
[2:23:28] CourageTheCowardIy: he can’t give u the answer if he knows
[2:23:32] ZunixHD: lang just does not want to talk about the usb stuff for some reason PepeLa
[2:23:33] washed_up_wapiti: oh, reach 5 star and u give her usb
[2:23:34] iiidaaah: wait whaaat, you even get CLEAN from her?
[2:23:40] martymagoo78: he has preached getting rep the whole time, so strange not for that
[2:23:47] DEATHWISHxSKULL: yea @iiidaaah
[2:23:56] larrymt9: Time for you two to take that over
[2:24:03] EyeScraem: I mean all the washed money is getting cleaned but would need like 50 washing to keep up
[2:24:05] TropicalToucan: but then you are missing the washing rep
[2:24:08] hypnomaze: someone should 100% work the VU rep
[2:24:09] ChiefinIt: Yea that takes out a ton of work for a 5% cut
[2:24:10] AntzRede: the money runs are chill
[2:24:10] sm0k3ngun: just take some tonight and find out
[2:24:14] Face_32: just get your pay in rolled bills and do it yourself
[2:24:14] Suleman_aftab: marty could experiment with the VU stuff
[2:24:25] shiifon: Oh that why she takes a cut
[2:24:31] TropicalToucan: need some person to grind VU with their own money not the crew money
[2:24:39] EyeScraem: @shiifon shes always taken a cut before these things existed
[2:24:41] rawrvixen: if she is only taking 5% then you are saving 5% from not having a money guy run it & taking a 10% cut maybe
[2:24:44] bruHoran: @face_32 terrible idea
[2:24:44] inyourmomseye: always possible she can give you other ways to clean too after enough stars
[2:24:45] Timemod: so the VU lady can take less cut of the groups cleaner?
[2:24:46] kSwong9: Crew needs rep with everyone
[2:24:48] lemongrapel: imagine 500k and bam instantly 100 rep LUL
[2:24:51] Eoghan_OMalley: If she only takes 5% when you get it right then it's cheaper than Tony/Octo LUL
[2:24:53] Xernique: That's potentially worth since 10% goes to the cleaners anyway
[2:25:11] EyeScraem: @Eoghan_OMalley yea but she can also take 60%
[2:25:15] Axy_p: and the washing machines already take a cut by adding to the power bill
[2:25:17] FlackAttack94: So she's actually taking less cut than the crews cleaners
[2:25:20] Baludor: She doesn't give clean, she gives washed
[2:25:25] glitchex: It fucks gigi hard
[2:25:25] ktothec99: Harry is already the Starman
[2:25:35] twitchisbaaad: JUICE HER UP
[2:25:43] ispokyjr: @axy_p thats actually true too Hmm
[2:25:48] r3turn2sender: it's rep that's not tapped yet
[2:25:50] jayruff65: I agree
[2:25:57] limpingmonke: Just go rogue and pay the fine Harry. Drop 50k dirty bills without a DON vote
[2:25:59] iby_oogy: @glitchex not really
[2:25:59] illestLUL: i think more washers is a temp solution
[2:26:01] jacobs802: Is there any other way to clean the dirty money @harry ?
[2:26:01] mCerti: She sounds like the tax woman LUL income tax
[2:26:02] Eoghan_OMalley: @eyescraem yea thats why I said when they get it right, surely there's a way to do it and it isn't random every day
[2:26:02] yahmobethere: sounds like should go test it
[2:26:06] izzygus333: that would make sense tho cos it would give more of a reason to go to the vu = more rp
[2:26:07] solyun25: Upsidedown rainbow symbols also look like a V and U overlapped
[2:26:08] DeeezzWho: time to rep up with VU
[2:26:08] Wordbeast: yeah could just make it a don vote
[2:26:10] DEATHWISHxSKULL: Even just using the VU once a week would help
[2:26:14] tannerrobbz: I actually love having Marty in this crew
[2:26:15] pow3rcosmic: don Harry carrying the weed game
[2:26:19] iby_oogy: The %cuts stay the same
[2:26:20] 1TrueTyrant: Thats true the washing machines do take a cut because of the power bill
[2:26:22] FlackAttack94: I wonder if octo and Tony already have rep with her from cleaning
[2:26:22] nsk_envy: They will figure it out. People are too greedy and spend 50k on dogshit cars anyways buddhaCreep
[2:26:25] shiifon: @glitchex not really she just need to factor it into her spreadsheet
[2:26:29] realitijd24: time to test it EZ
[2:26:31] bamap002: you can start testing now with small amounts if the dons agree
[2:26:33] EyeScraem: @Eoghan_OMalley yea for sure, just only do VU on profitable days and the rest of the time clean normally
[2:26:38] hvnlydivine99: You all used to call a building "colorful "...
[2:26:38] Nightbot: If you have Amazon Prime you can sub to Harry for FREE, just go to https://twitch.amazon.com/prime activate it, come back and subscribe free of charge.
[2:26:38] 9Rux: @tannerrobbz him and yuno are the brains of the crew
[2:26:40] jayruff65: especially if you can’t build rep with her I would think it would be a great idea for someone to start
[2:26:42] abc1121: turn it all in and if its bad pay just say a fake amount so u can keep the fine with the rest EZ
[2:26:44] tannerrobbz: @1truetyrant that very true!!
[2:26:45] IvyOlive: you already pay a cut to the washers for anything less than 10% is worth for her
[2:26:46] Dazzbigd: The other choice is what speedy did.   Sell the dirty cash at an acceptable price
[2:26:47] TPGScotlandlive: If 20 people had 5 washers each wouldn't that solve the problem?
[2:26:56] martymagoo78: I wonder where Clem cleans all her money from fence before jewellery
[2:27:01] limpingmonke: Do it Harry Do it. Listen to the litttle devil on you shoulder. Turn all the dirty bills iinto the VU lady
[2:27:05] pow3rcosmic: does any one have rep with the VU woman?
[2:27:06] Xernique: Fr Marty is a smart and emotionally intelligent dude. Him and Gigi are so good for the crew
[2:27:06] BlacKnight2514: if lang dont want to let marty do the VU angle no?? 2
[2:27:09] BlacKnight2514: @Harry
[2:27:11] jayruff65: maybe the treasurer ?
[2:27:15] sCambodian: Any gamba I got 673k to spend
[2:27:16] Moby1kanobee: oh damn u really are hungry...eat a bug
[2:27:27] EshaneDharmaPunx: IS the % set by rep or is it random each visit?
[2:27:28] nsk_envy: Eat THIS!
[2:27:31] grace_: @TPGScotlandlive that would be very hard to manage, and hard to track, plus the 100 number is assuming they are running 24/7
[2:27:36] obscurewill: @dazzbigd they were mad at speedy for doing that because of "rep" but still don't even use the person that gives rep for the rolled bills
[2:27:42] washed_up_wapiti: does the battery goes down if car not in use
[2:27:47] Moby1kanobee: if you can give it ALL at once then 100% do it at 5%
[2:27:52] izzygus333: wait is there VU rep??
[2:27:56] DEATHWISHxSKULL: Yes
[2:28:01] coldeveryday: @izzygus333 correct
[2:28:08] pow3rcosmic: harrEz zetarkStare buddhaWTF
[2:28:11] Suleman_aftab: lang also has too much on his plate too
[2:28:11] izzygus333: ok I think thatll defo lead to something
[2:28:16] EyeScraem: @izzygus333 yea ppl have forever thought it does nothing
[2:28:21] shiifon: Someone should take their cut in dirty money on Friday to do the VU
[2:28:31] DEATHWISHxSKULL: VU gonna need to be used at some point, imagine when other drugs are out plus money from heists lol
[2:28:50] izzygus333: @eyescraem damn people might be sleeping on it
[2:28:50] itzkyol: is omie live?
[2:28:54] DEATHWISHxSKULL: can't rely on washing machines forever

[2:29:19] EyeScraem: @izzygus333 yea its possible, ppl cleaned with it early on and went oh shit she takes too much even ppl that grinded her rep stopped
[2:29:23] Futendoji: yea, the cleaner drivers get 10%
[2:29:25] martymagoo78: it’s 200k in washing machines lol
[2:29:30] Xernique: 10% cut for cleaners too
[2:29:32] Fugeki: can’t you also depo the dirty bills at the VU ?
[2:29:36] sh4gun: marty the shadow treasureer
[2:29:40] UnluckyPhil: WeSmart
[2:29:41] Baludor: People still have to run the money. She doesn't give clean cash, just washed
[2:29:44] ForgetMidnight: love meth
[2:29:44] woolsCW: so many smart ppl in the crew
[2:29:45] DEATHWISHxSKULL: yes @fugeki
[2:29:45] Futendoji: but the thing is you got people for every manual step, and some enjoy it.....
[2:29:48] jshwan: maff FeelsDankMan
[2:29:49] mCerti: Plus you wouldn’t have to pay everyone out for cleaning and running and stuff
[2:29:58] DarthRadonis: So does the person taking the rolled bills to her get a cut?
[2:29:59] izzygus333: @eyescraem yeah and it makes more sense why she takes a big cut if it leads to somthing ashlolHmm
[2:30:24] washed_up_wapiti: how much money did marty gave to vu to reach 3 stars?
[2:30:26] envi_jenkins: Don Marty harrWarry the math guy

[2:32:53] grace_: @adama214 pretty sure its just a texture difference, they clean the same speed

[2:35:50] Fugeki: @harry so you’re the product guy basically? Will that involve all drugs and other craftables ?
[2:35:53] cr4ck3rs43: if your bringing in 100k a day it aint that much 250k investment
[2:35:57] CourageTheCowardIy: 260k but for 100k a day is definitely worth it
[2:36:01] Moby1kanobee: does ilya stream??

[2:59:25] LivingManiac: got to think, grower can earn extra money while growing like this
[2:59:25] CinnbonSupaflav: the sellers have more risk too
[2:59:27] Flipstar333: grower get too much imo if anything
[2:59:28] Lutre: yeah selling is longer and more risk-intensive
[2:59:30] chaddarcheesely: and it’s more risky

[2:59:34] MrBoOoOoOoOoOoM: in my opinion the cleaner should get less and seller more

[2:59:37] jfletcher68: also your making a lot hunting while growing
[2:59:37] coldeveryday: @JoeKsova growing has way less risk and time compared to pushers
[2:59:38] ispokyjr: Hmm maybe raise tge
[2:59:40] joshbankai: Sellers might actually need a buff to 50 and house down to 20, tbh
[2:59:41] jshwan: grower gets guaranteed money
[2:59:45] Laffing_Man: luciano has to hunt more then lol
[2:59:46] yubihunter: yeah the percentage needs to be adjusted for sure
[2:59:47] SolidN: and they cant do anythin at the side
[2:59:47] Tropikwano_: grower 20% for hours, washer 10% for 20 minutes?
[2:59:49] tannerrobbz: I think that’s a great split

[2:59:53] hordoes: growing takes a lot of time but you can hunt inbetween so that makes up for it a lot
[2:59:54] JoeKsova: fair enough
[2:59:56] shiifon: seller is alo more likely to get caught and fined/raid too
[2:59:58] mrdumpling420: Unless they get Ramee Matlock as their lawyer
[3:00:00] searlesbarkleyk: Seller should get less, this can be done super fast if done efficiently
[3:00:03] monkeydtea: are they doing hunting for fun?
[3:00:04] ragethesenuts: not including potental fines it caught
[3:00:04] lunorx6: and later you guys can always change the %
[3:00:09] boobysmoke: The risk factors into everything
[3:00:24] ChubbyAndReadyToParty: Sellers need 50-60% standing there is boring as hell for them lol
[3:00:29] joshbankai: +1
[3:00:32] ytheyas: D:
[3:00:32] coldeveryday: @searlesbarkleyk have you seen any seller streams, it takes a long time and have to deal with cops
[3:00:37] jshwan: @monkeydtea to pass time while plants grow and make money
[3:00:39] 44Maverick: D:
[3:00:45] iiidaaah: @Tropikwano_ yep but there is also the fact that cleaner can just clean 5000, %10 of that is 500 lol
[3:00:49] ispokyjr: @searlesbarkleyk hmm the problem tho is they need tosit around for long hours and heavier risk
[3:00:54] coldeveryday: frfr

[3:42:08] HonourableOne: its kinda unrealistic to keep them under 50 long term
[3:42:08] mrfunvg: because its 49% of what scooby dooby sold
[3:42:09] mattandah: its harder for everyone to progress yea]
[3:42:09] Lutre: it's proportional, it gets harder for them to go up
[3:42:09] TastyKudzu: It they're at 50 to your 100 you have to outsell them 2 to 1 to maintain that ratio.
[3:42:10] petterseff: the fuck was that alarm thoiugh
[3:42:13] 2emedy: They have to sell x2 the amount of weed to knock them down.
[3:42:14] slurpy824: they need like triple their sellers to lower it
[3:42:15] HonourableOne: 70-80 would be solid
[3:42:17] yubihunter: nobody pushing today thats why KEKW
[3:42:17] arthurcfs: to keep zaza at 50% you need outsell 2:1
[3:42:18] fublian: Seems at 50% you need 2x the amount of sales, so hopefully at 75% it would be 1.5 and so on
[3:42:18] epohs: Arush went to sleep
[3:42:18] VibinDoggo: it will eventually be just as hard for them to gain

[3:42:20] difficultsleep3r: KJ goes for 24 hours. Then sleeps for 6
[3:42:22] TropicalToucan: well eventually they can get to 99% but never overcome unless you guys all stop selling for a bit

[3:42:29] chanceroo321: gotta start robbing the locals
[3:42:36] mrfunvg: to keep at 50% youd need to sell 2:1
[3:42:37] ahebbak: its quanity amt
[3:42:38] ThePepperPeople: Harry is always the best vibe
[3:42:39] ProngsAedan: in long term if all the theory is right... They will go up to 50% and stay there. As long as scoody got sold.
[3:42:39] anaughh: even when there’s like 4 pushers it feels like it barely goes down

[4:51:40] CourageTheCowardIy: yep
[4:51:42] SpilledNuts: yeah it's a tamagachi, you gotta feed it
[4:51:43] cesmsu: could it be that you bring the usb to the arcade machine and somehow be able to hack it and play a mini game ?
[4:51:43] Phoenix_Nectar: its not something you need to scan its just something you need to pick up in one location and the whole clue pionts to one location

[4:52:10] valky_rat: hack other ppls computers

[4:52:12] ANOMOlos: plug the usb into the device?
[4:52:12] quote_me_if_horsen: oh shit, it might copy g6 key cards
[4:52:13] tanderson119: yup
[4:52:15] Lesbifriend: idk, it's name seems to imply it's a USB so it needs another device to be able to do what the flipperzero does
[4:52:15] Wordbeast: maybe tomorrow
[4:52:15] leekillua111: imo you need it on you to "see" something
[4:52:16] ItsMattyyyyy: can maybe use the choptool to look for spot to use the clipper chimp
[4:52:24] Wordbeast: carrying it solo is wild
[4:52:31] lemongrapel: but why would it decay if its not available
[4:52:32] lyfmobile: @mkmarkou they can also use it to create false wifi
[4:52:34] Gordiwat4: Is just a rd attachment
[4:52:41] OWBallaz: the problem is @Harry that machine needs to be programed and right now it must be clear of programming i guess

[4:52:44] fulladelphia: maybe kill someone first
[4:52:50] common_idiot: has anyone tried breaking into someone's house with it?
[4:52:52] 1iwill: you might be able to scan and copy access cards to security doors or something
[4:52:53] rairan29: Maybe check the tablet when you have the thing in grape seed?
[4:52:53] HayHotshot: Time to try and unlock every door in the city harrSTEER
[4:52:53] roesslerm: or it might give u the tool for house robberies
[4:52:58] Phoenix_Nectar: can you see how the rows keep narrowing down. thats how you need to search.
[4:52:59] Lesbifriend: @lemongrapel i wonder if Devs thought it would take longer to find the guy selling the thing
[4:53:05] orlandito03: @lesbifriend no it says hacking tool… the item image looks like a usb tho so it throws everyone off
[4:53:06] tacticalgamer147: isn’t there a arcade in Vinewood?

[4:53:55] lenny1287: It seems like a tool
[4:53:57] Wala1123: chimp SCHIZO

[4:54:11] NFGNoFearzz: would they unlock it though without their being a use for it?
[4:54:12] ellystacklebox: Can you plug in into a drone. Might be a vent on the roof of the arcade you can fly a drone through
[4:54:12] argonize: need to find the npc
[4:54:13] lyfmobile: @clunted it is
[4:54:14] veriquay: why is it decaying if it’s not in the server yet though

[4:54:37] szilopsybinh: Have it on you at the monkey mosaic.

[5:00:04] AtiraTiki: or find the game that was written on it?
[5:00:05] szilopsybinh: If the dongle is a transmitter it can't have infinite range, that's why I think you haveto stand near the monkey mosaic.
[5:00:08] Lesbifriend: @franciscooo25 it's actually marty's car
[5:00:08] XxLordBelxX: Clue seems like a cypher.. v shape means between, the oil feels and the airline between grape seed and the ocean? River? In a field or bush perhaps, A CAR
[5:00:09] devthebasedgod: but why have a limited item that expires in a week that you can't use
[5:00:16] Cleartrax: Why offer the hacking tool though?
[5:00:18] Jondy: that might be end game once you get more usb's
[5:00:19] Leowulf: perhaps the purchasable USB is "rainbow" meaning its any color. vs you eventually do house robberies and get specific colors for the slots
[5:00:20] xLegendori: if the rainbowroad is the only hint has anyone checked the locations from that heist?
[5:00:20] TwoLeanFour: its just weird that they would let you spend 50btc on the thing that does nothing and expires
