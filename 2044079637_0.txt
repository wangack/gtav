[0:09:55] scha_de: Framed poster POGGIES
[0:10:03] NemisizZ: 35 is low ngl
[0:10:05] gostonko: thats super cheap for animated
[0:10:06] ObamaBinDroning: make it 50
[0:10:09] NemisizZ: 50 is prolly more in line

[0:10:46] Kikobri_: Twitch finally figured out that animated emotes are more popular maaaaan
[0:10:50] NemisizZ: they dont get the tone in the channel
[0:10:53] mariuspure: how long does it take to draw a single emote ? (non animated)? @Kikobri_
[0:10:55] CuppaT_XYZ: why pay when bozos like me do it for free Sadding

[0:12:09] Kikobri_: tbh as long as it's readable and funny it's a good emote, don't need to be an artist

[0:22:36] AfroAltruism: hasn't the US been trying to bring chip manufacturing back to the US

[2:16:02] Light1stNight: the job itself is easy the only tedious thing about it is the driving back and forth
[2:16:19] luckerooni: low key if someone made a furniture business, farmed their own wood, and sold their extra at a reasonable price i think lumber union would be dead in the water
[2:16:30] dyll3: Do they have  any expenses

[2:19:45] onix146: LUL
[2:19:50] luckerooni: @timbres, then you'll have the anti-union union union
[2:20:00] Light1stNight: but then you would have them killing each other
[2:20:29] UnknownHuskyTV: They own the market so they fully control it until someone tries to make themselves competition
[2:20:30] HallJams: it's a perceived monopoly
[2:20:48] onix146: mhm
[2:20:53] BotDoris: i call it "?
[2:20:54] timbres: It’s more of a Leslie move to see unions dominating markets and just make a Union to be in charge of the unions lol
[2:20:54] jinxedluck: wood costs 0 if u kill them all and take it
[2:20:58] luckerooni: what lumber have basically done is solve the logistics problem of getting wood and thats their product and theyre overcharging on that
[2:21:41] Kikobri_: the union stuff is a lot bigger in NA hours for sure, there's also all the mayoral stuff
[2:21:45] meego0o: it also helps that it is a job not in the city, ppl would pay more to just not to go up north
