[4:09:13] Alyis_Cielo1438: That's why I hate these dating shows bc they just bring out the WORSE people
[4:09:17] ixpillxi: when he tried to manipulate her into marrying him.
[4:09:30] lazyquill: also telling her to go to the gym isn't even about her health, its just about his attraction to her
[4:09:34] robotmoms: the fathers permission thing can either be like cute and respectful or like a huge red flag lmaoooo
[4:09:36] KaliSparkle: “I’m going to get amber”
[4:09:40] starkitling: ewwwwww I’m sorry I hate that
[4:09:47] Goldensirens: real

[4:11:28] lazyquill: when he put his head on her chest and called himself a baby...
[4:11:28] Alyis_Cielo1438: That'd be the start of Carmen's black widow era
[4:11:42] Alyis_Cielo1438: @lazyquill what....
[4:11:49] trashboytoni: and it would be different if the pregnant person genuinely wanted to workout on their own but FORCED?
[4:11:50] osaussies: @annnnnahhhc and just think that’s just the stuff that they’ll show publicly.
[4:11:54] hiitsBrii: literally like you’re the one that got her pregnant?

[4:13:46] robotmoms: the other seasons .... some of them are WILD
[4:13:49] bunbun_1998: the drama when they all meet each other is the best
