[3:16:57] theblazinwzn: SharkDance
[3:17:03] TheSauceShaman: so how does maranda rights work here, you said it was a spontanious utterance right?
[3:17:09] ChiDorky: @Princeofiowa delusional
[3:17:15] TheSauceShaman: is it because you didn't ask him any questions?
[3:17:26] ChiDorky: prince of iowa is a great and honest man !!!!!!
[3:17:33] Vikinick: He's also a cop so he would know his rights already anyways
[3:17:43] ChiDorky: Real recognize real
[3:17:55] Princeofiowa: Chi is far too honest and humble to pay for propaganda
[3:17:59] theblazinwzn: lulWut
[3:18:01] Vikinick: And if he tries to argue that he doesn't know his rights... you fire him for admitting to being incompetent
[3:18:06] Sieferifle: @ChiDorky this sounds like the start of your stock manipulation arc
[3:18:30] MissJessMJM: @Vikinick Doesn't matter.  Career criminals know their rights as well.  They have to be read no matter what in criminal matters
[3:19:28] Swiftym8: those 2 thing aren't really comparable
[3:19:36] ChiDorky: @ChiDorky idk what you're talking about
[3:19:37] friggarn: Burden of proof is so high to prove he knew he lied... GL
[3:19:54] ChiDorky: I've never manipulated any stocks of any kind !!!!!!!!!
[3:19:56] MissJessMJM: They are because Perjury is a felony....... It's a crime
[3:20:01] TheSauceShaman: i genuinly dont think he knew he lied
[3:20:15] thestarsaredown: @MissJessMJM you can prove/infer knowledge of his rights through other things, like on NP when asking a lawyer proved you knew your rights
[3:20:18] TheSauceShaman: i think the court case was a bit of a shitshow
[3:20:22] Raedosz: the self snitch is the hard bit to defend against
[3:20:26] spacerecycler: if nothing else this may solidify miranda or garrity
[3:20:31] TheSauceShaman: yeah i think bloom is handling it great
[3:20:40] TheSauceShaman: its great that this is happening
[3:20:43] Archaius: yeah it is a problem that they misremember such important information 2 hours later
[3:20:45] AzureMarquis: whats the state announcement
[3:20:46] Hento: if you are lying on the stand, knowing or not.....
[3:21:08] AzureMarquis: KEKL

[3:21:21] TrueRageRune: aight fam, the next update is purjury removal
[3:21:21] Hento: I mean all passed to DA, fuck it
[3:21:22] monnclock: too real
[3:21:23] Vikinick: Just join the DA's office and charge everyone with perjury yourself
[3:21:23] TheSauceShaman: isn't that what you're doing already
[3:21:26] Quiet50ul: how can you keep a cop a cop if he lies in court - cops can lie all they want but not in court
[3:21:27] Archaius: oh fuck
[3:21:28] Lurks_like_Gaston: You really are Jordan Steele
[3:21:29] Archaius: thats really bad
[3:21:32] thestarsaredown: there never was intent to lie
[3:21:33] LeaZhee: thin blue line :)
[3:21:35] Archaius: thats giga bad
[3:21:36] TrueRageRune: "i didnt mean to lie, it just happened"
[3:21:36] Raedosz: thats his best defense gone
[3:21:37] friggarn: It's the bloom clause, both Blooms
[3:21:38] Erigzback: This change is technically pre-charges too right?
[3:21:43] Sieferifle: A working cop with a perjury charge hanging over his head KEKL
[3:21:50] SpecialSyd: Susge this smells like an cover up
[3:21:52] MissJessMJM: The actual chat read the same.  They just added the last part
[3:21:55] thestarsaredown: @Erigzback doesn't matter, its based on when you did the crime
[3:21:57] MissJessMJM: charge
[3:21:58] vitamin_bee: did he know it to be false at the time?
[3:22:01] Erigzback: @thestarsaredown gotcha
[3:22:03] TheSauceShaman: its the same they just added the docket matter
[3:22:05] SamsonOption: The word9ng of the charge wasn't changed, just the DA stuff tacked on
[3:22:06] Hento: I donno I think he was clearly trying to cover for the cops
[3:22:11] PyroViking_: they might have fucked him there KEKW
[3:22:13] Hento: and back tracked it later
[3:22:14] Dysinfo: Bloom got a law amended FeelsStrongMan
[3:22:29] ArticKong: no more affecticing the outcome stuff?
[3:22:40] middy_92: How do you even charge it? Docket with new definition or old or?
[3:22:49] Hento: @ArticKong that was never in this version
[3:22:50] AzureMarquis: @ArticKong thats a NP thing
[3:22:53] ThousandEyesAnd1: I didn’t know it was false 2 hours ago but now i do without any outside influences
[3:22:54] ArticKong: ahh ok
[3:23:00] Spikee439: so Burton is going to get out of it
[3:23:04] ChiDorky: Get this corrupt lying COP out of here UltraMad
[3:23:09] Vikinick: judges need to stop saying stuff about the law and just write it into the law
[3:23:12] poehoy: KILL ALL COPS
[3:23:12] Rem753: affected the outcome was the NP wording
[3:23:14] thestarsaredown: @ArticKong NP also deleted that because it was near impossible to get
[3:23:17] TheSauceShaman: i think he is gonna get out of it because everyone wants him too lmao
[3:23:27] Hento: as long as it gets cops to tighten up their testimony
[3:23:31] Hyperion_prime: If, in a hypothetical scenario, Burton is found innocent would he still be able to be a cop?
[3:23:34] middy_92: You might need edit on it to seem
[3:23:42] Hyperion_prime: Or would that be a stain on his rep
[3:23:45] ReefEQ: she has a job?
[3:23:47] ChiDorky: I think we smokin on that Burton pack
[3:23:49] Swiftym8: lulWut you know the answer to that
[3:23:50] TheSauceShaman: @Hyperion_prime why wouldn't he be
[3:23:54] Archaius: if the whole case wouldve gotten thrown out then id did affect the outcome since he got charge with the citation
[3:23:54] Hento: Tea time?
[3:23:55] Quiet50ul: cops lose intgerty if its swempt under the rug then

[3:42:23] middy_92: That they do extra to
[3:42:23] exhume125: Brisket done right is better than burnt ends
[3:42:27] Chrysaetos: Where are you eating?
[3:42:39] theblazinwzn: also you should get korean brisket, its much harder to dry out
[3:42:39] thion7: Moose really said good brisket is good and yall are mad
[3:42:44] Chrysaetos: brisket clears 9/10 BBQ meats
[3:42:52] middy_92: God I miss KC bbq

[3:43:00] czeksmyx: if you're getting Korean food and you aren't getting bulgogi...you are fucking up
[3:43:06] esrou: Yeah. I prefer ribs or steak
[3:43:14] ReceBeast: brisket is like anything else if someone that knows how to cook its good\
[3:43:19] zara1024: even when it's cooked properly it's just mid at best, I'd much rather a good steak instead
[3:43:20] Rem753: most of the time sure, but when it's perfect Kreygasm
[3:43:22] UltimateMcNasty: @Chrysaetos L take. Most smoked sausage is better than brisket
[3:43:22] Chrysaetos: Gladge
[3:43:42] Chrysaetos: @UltimateMcNasty actually a crazy take
[3:43:51] LetsGoPolice: would you go to Texan BBQ in Korea?
[3:43:53] exhume125: Brisket should have enough layers of fat to make it juicy for a smoke
[3:44:19] Swiftym8: so she isnt learning anything again OMEGALAUGHING

[3:48:15] Hento: yea all its parts you are like wtf, but when combined, damn that shit is good
[3:48:16] middy_92: I feel like it's all the sauce. Just different breadcrumb on fried chicken

[4:19:36] Kathula: Apples? So it didn't happen today?
[4:19:52] AzureMarquis: nah this was days ago
[4:19:57] tontheilie: We can maybe convict him if we coach the witnesses KEKW
[4:20:17] AzureMarquis: yeah takes the whole PD to take down Jordan
[4:20:41] Crosis86: even with all that i think hell win lol
[4:20:44] expertdolphin1884: I'm calling it now 6-0
[4:20:51] Vooklife: Tampering???????????

[4:21:35] UltimateMcNasty: peepoPhone "Hey Bloom, since you're in the office; I've got another LSSD deputy you need to fire for a stupid reason"
[4:21:36] Loremipsum21: Is it really hit and run pedestrian if all the statements say the pedestrian was hit by their own vehicle?
[4:21:36] Rem753: @Spikee439 nah, just psychopath jordan during the CDL suspension. 15 days i think
[4:21:36] Crosis86: i mean if he wasnt doing the ramming etc itll be wild if he gets reckless use
[4:21:37] ItsMeMattK: coaching has a bad connotation because its diet corroborating false testimony.
[4:21:44] 4kona: its not tampering. it only is if you tell them what exactly to say lol. you can tell them what questions will be asked and ask them what their answer will be
[4:21:45] tontheilie: You're not supposed to coach. You can give them prep questions but going over answers with them(which is what coaching is) is 1000% illegal

[4:23:26] Spikee439: Not a bench trial so yep
[4:23:27] lloggiczz: you should know the answer to every question you ask your witness
[4:23:27] AzureMarquis: it sounds like a lot of he said she said
[4:23:29] Rem753: @Moosebrother it's the difference between prepping a witness and coaching a witness
[4:23:29] Shibousha: Coach the witnesses to give a 10-second pause for the ADA to object.
[4:23:31] theblazinwzn: SharkDance

[5:47:24] Erigzback: Group of all command with ada and da get together without Bloom to discuss it. Oof
[5:47:55] friggarn: PEPW *whistles*
[5:48:04] ChrisInDC: also didn’t Burton go after lol

[5:48:21] Milsera: Moosebrother Gaming FeelsOkayMan

[5:48:43] AzureCatalyst: I love Moosebrother getting Moosesplained KEKW
[5:48:43] irtrol: monkaW venting about a coworker is it o7 for bloom
[5:48:47] esrou: Politics baby
[5:48:48] Hento: I mean he doesnt need to be convicted to be fired

[5:49:36] ChrisInDC: Bob & Greco have no idea lol
[5:49:47] Swiftym8: does anyone tell greco no? or does he do what he wants
[5:49:48] Skinnymctoothpick: @Milsera mONXo when? (also no pressure enjoy ur life)
[5:49:58] SpecialSyd: that thin blue line is pretty thick once it comes to perjury
[5:50:01] arcticdruid: they decided that before you even made a full report?
[5:50:02] Birbado: mbroChomp 🍜
[5:50:03] Sieferifle: @Swiftym8 only person ive seen do that is bloom KEKL

[5:50:53] Birbado: wait wtf ferraro too? OMEGALAUGHING
[5:51:19] ChrisInDC: yeah I don’t know how you could charge only 1
[5:51:46] theblazinwzn: bye gn chat
[5:51:52] Erigzback: If this case doesn't make it to court to be seen I'd be curious how anyone will get Perjury into a case w/o specifically saying "I lied on purpose".
[5:51:56] esrou: I do think it would be a great trial
[5:51:56] ChrisInDC: also if they let Burton use the I didn’t remember excuse why can’t Godric use it lol
[5:52:05] Milsera: @Skinnymctoothpick ngl i kinda want to play but i dont want to do the grind for prio again LULW
[5:52:17] Skinnymctoothpick: @Milsera do what makes you happy but miss seeing ur presence mbroH
[5:52:20] Archaius: yeah charging only 1 of them is giga weird, looks a lot like making a exception for burton
[5:52:32] Milsera: took me like 2 years to get prio on nopixel
[5:52:35] Skinnymctoothpick: @Milsera totally valid
[5:52:35] Milsera: FeelsOkayMan
[5:52:39] Spikee439: no way
[5:52:55] Spikee439: you have to be kidding me
[5:53:16] ChrisInDC: Burton seems even more guilty to me bc he tried to use it against a cop after the fact lmao. just forgot about perjury
[5:53:29] Milsera: @Skinnymctoothpick mbroH
[5:53:32] SnitchBubbles: Chris peepoHappy

[5:54:14] Spikee439: Politics. So great
[5:54:21] iGrim: This politics game everyone is playing is causing corruption to go unchecked since the heads are also corrupt classic
[5:54:21] Archaius: they only fair thing is to let a judge rule it
[5:54:24] Hento: or you give em an early retirement and send em on his way like real copes
[5:54:30] SnitchBubbles: metz Susge
[5:54:37] ChrisInDC: crazy
[5:54:40] Hento: no way Metz...

[5:54:50] early_retirement: that sets a horrible precedent
[5:54:56] Archaius: thats bad
[5:54:58] Swiftym8: FeelsStrongMan looks like pd never changes

[5:56:47] bigby922: when he called you he snitched on Godrick but not on himself KEKW
[5:56:48] Spikee439: is it sad that I am rooting for the underdog which is Jordan to win and clean up this PD. When you can trust people in power or with power, that's when things go downhill.
[5:57:29] Swiftym8: Gladge already back to higher ups sweeping shit under the rug
[5:57:30] SnitchBubbles: he mathed Pog

[5:58:24] AzureMarquis: so is burton just staying suspended or what
[5:58:25] AzureMarquis: KEKW
[5:58:25] Hento: them not doing the god damn statement is delaying shit so much
[5:58:29] ChrisInDC: telephone game
[5:58:42] cryogenixx: @0ctember seems like charge both or none, leaning towards both and see how it plays out

[6:00:45] Rem753: @0ctember according to leads bob and metz, but could be telephone
[6:00:45] LetsGoPolice: just an initial thought. nothing concrete
[6:00:59] AzureMarquis: neither read the transcript
[6:01:03] Erigzback: I hope Leeds pushes it regardless of feedback. Would be a great case to watch imo.
[6:01:03] Archaius: why is he tryin to highway blast a buffalo lmao
[6:01:08] 0ctember: Bob and Metz? Oof. Have they talked to Bloom about it yet? I would have thought they would be sticklers about having cops committing perjury
[6:01:28] Milsera: monkaSTEER
[6:01:29] AzureMarquis: @0ctember nope they feedback looped with the AG for 45 minutes
[6:01:29] SnitchBubbles: @0ctember as others have already said they dont know the full story yet
