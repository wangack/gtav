[3:25:53] ToxiccLadd: LookingForWhoAsked johnson looking for any reason to use his fists
[3:26:00] BakinPacman: was he able to get his baton out though i wonder
[3:26:45] Despoiler98: how many dap for a suspension?
[3:26:54] ToxiccLadd: 10 for high command review
[3:26:56] BadRabbits: @Despoiler98 5
[3:26:57] alpacalunchuwu: lolol
[3:27:00] alpacalunchuwu: hi
[3:27:02] themanwithanrx7: what are the complaints ?
[3:27:03] ToxiccLadd: oh yea 5

[3:27:23] BadRabbits: every dap after 5 is a 24 day i think? might be after 7
[3:27:27] spookyghost21: Episode 2 attack of the johnson lmao
[3:27:27] BadRabbits: 5 is a 24h too
[3:27:27] xtrainhobo: sounds like you guys need a PD Fight Club 😂
[3:27:37] OGprodigy: @ToxiccLadd yeah 10 is indefinite pending review
[3:27:38] BadRabbits: 10 is suspended pending review
[3:27:44] Despoiler98: then he can leave the PD and become a boxer
[3:27:46] BakinPacman: thats a bad response LUL
[3:27:49] sBuon: custyHUH

[3:28:20] sBuon: that's a prideful man response if I've ever heard one AAAA
[3:28:28] jinnytolls: I mean if there are 3 other cops there, does he need 78s?
[3:28:31] ToxiccLadd: *joke* Johnson about to get dapped for leveling the playing field instead of using the bitch be good stick
[3:28:33] BadRabbits: to be fair if he used the baton, K, blackwell, and everyone within 10m of him would have gone down too
[3:28:35] wombo2hiitcombo: Well if he gets fired, it sounds like he may have a career as a boxer
[3:28:54] skinnylegend000: Senior officer gives a correction to not fist fight but he just says fck your correction imma fist fight anyway.
[3:29:17] ToxiccLadd: these hands do indeed be rated E for everyone
[3:29:41] jinnytolls: Ah see theres the problem
[3:29:42] sBuon: custyWHY custyWHY custyWHY custyWHY custyWHY custyWHY custyWHY custyWHY
[3:29:51] ToxiccLadd: oop not a good look if true
[3:30:10] Shynzira: should give him boxing gloves at this point KEKW
[3:30:17] BadRabbits: to be fair, the 78's is a bigger issue with today's break in
[3:30:21] BakinPacman: if he said something like i would use my baton if i had the chance then it would be a sensible response but straight up saying ill just use my firsts is KEKW
[3:30:39] jinnytolls: @BadRabbits true no 78s being alone in the garage is a problem
[3:30:41] sBuon: oop
[3:30:45] themanwithanrx7: oof
[3:30:53] OGprodigy: oop

[3:31:03] TheBFG_01: I mean, kinda valid since they are probationary officers
[3:31:04] sBuon: o7 Johnson see you in "Revenge of the Johnson"
[3:31:08] jessielight: ouch... hello understaffed how ya doin? lol
[3:31:09] ToxiccLadd: Hmm the RP intensifies
[3:31:13] BadRabbits: @jinnytolls 5 daps
[3:31:17] Despoiler98: I mean this is insubordination at this point since he's been told what not to do and blatantly keeps doing it
[3:31:55] jessielight: yeah the beating up thing is no good
[3:32:01] Despoiler98: @missdolly2 there are hundreds of applicants, they can hire better
[3:32:25] JohnieP: At the same time, if she had enough time to admonish Johnson why didn't she try to arrest K for assault?
[3:32:27] TheBFG_01: it’s like these newbies aren’t understanding the concept of the new pd
[3:32:32] jessielight: twice? oy
[3:32:42] JediJacob_: PepeLaugh i mean..... Technically
[3:33:02] jinnytolls: @BadRabbits Normally id agree with 5 but the problem is its fairly easy to get dapped too. But agreed that the waiting list for cop is like 1000 people and the officers need to be better. K is also a slimeball and theres no need to g check him
[3:33:11] jessielight: @Despoiler98 true

[3:35:10] Verion: even cornwood has managed like a month without any DAPs lol
[3:35:24] skinnylegend000: so many people want to be officers and this persons just consistent issues.
