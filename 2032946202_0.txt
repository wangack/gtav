[19:28:22] SurvivorPlayz999: what if you try to remove VPN
[19:28:23] alex_shimada: @notwhackerr yeah but there's probably a different app for that

[20:04:18] nuacid: What happens if you click send crypto
[20:04:19] leekillua111: hmm
[20:04:21] Light1stNight: i would assume you would want their crypto address and username to hack it
[20:04:29] lowlyp0p: i think we are missrepresenting the name of the app
[20:04:30] Blackedfr: why have you been live for 20 hours get rest
[20:04:31] andyhlp: mac address is the one you hacked into so its not the pc's mac address i think
[20:04:32] nuacid: Or if you click receive crypto?
[20:04:35] yyyyaaaammmm: he def not listening to u
[20:04:38] Fedoreos: @nuacid It asks for wallet address and amount.
[20:04:40] no_q0: monkeHmm
[20:04:42] taxism: mhm

[20:05:08] dustyogz: @omie try sending to urself?
[20:05:11] leekillua111: true
[20:05:16] Codepiled: maybe hacking creates a session in wally. and somehow you can hijack other peoples sessions
[20:05:16] WryGamer_: -1
[20:05:17] w0blz: what is the +
[20:05:17] ipiv: correct dizzehhh
[20:05:18] Pure36: Try sending crypto to your own laptops?
[20:05:20] SunGodIX: mhm
[20:05:22] rheonyn: oscuh he is cooking
[20:05:22] luckerooni: oh wait i think hes right i think its just a gui
[20:05:23] bigmacdogg: @omie think of like this -> if you sign into an anons wifi with their mac address and crypto and click "send crypto", would you send it from your hdd or theirs?
[20:05:26] 5Jonny: hm could be right
[20:05:27] unholy_steve: its stored in miner
[20:05:27] Cuhlixa: mhm
[20:05:28] SunGodIX: LETHIMCOOK
[20:05:28] Light1stNight: wally is just middleman
[20:05:33] ÏûîÏ°¥Ïûê: Its probably just for sending/receiving through it rather than being stored on it
[20:05:34] leekillua111: ye
[20:05:34] taxism: mhm
[20:05:35] M4XIAC: wally is like a middlrman

[20:05:46] notyourcookies69: Yooo
[20:05:48] rhythm_sk: mhm (idk anything)
[20:05:54] fish99: could the it be showing that address because you are sharing the same wifi as the transaction?
[20:05:56] tazxo: wait so do diff pc's have diff mac addresses or no
[20:05:56] lowlyp0p: mac address
[20:05:56] Shadowdott: hacking rep though? mhm
[20:05:59] ipiv: @ipiv catYep
[20:06:00] nuacid: Mac address?
[20:06:01] leekillua111: via hdd? idk
[20:06:02] brikbeans: sending and receiving
[20:06:04] ÏûîÏ°¥Ïûê: Takes crypto from your hdd and sends it to other person idk
[20:06:05] zxykm: its like an extension to the miner
[20:06:06] Codepiled: OH CONNECT TO A NETWORK AND SNIFF FOR SESSION AUTHENTICATION. hijack the session to send as them
[20:06:07] bigbill2137: is it just a way to transfer not store?

[20:06:40] shaefferzz: did he hack it?
[20:06:49] Fumad: yes and yes
[20:06:50] dustyogz: @omie try sending some to urself
[20:07:00] unholy_steve: yeah
[20:07:01] housieee: buh tcoin
[20:07:03] brikbeans: MAc address the same crypto address different
[20:07:03] ketchup__: BrokeBack
[20:07:19] rayhxxn: Its not possible to hack a cold storage right?
[20:07:21] lowlyp0p: @dustyogz you cannot send and receive to the same address
[20:07:25] rheonyn: Does the mac address change when you change hdd ? mhm
[20:07:26] Fossabot: omieEvil watch omie's newest video: https://youtu.be/S8rbYuNDXQI "Marty Banks | First Day of NoPixel 4.0"
[20:07:26] Shadowdott: OOOO
[20:07:31] unholy_steve: amount sent 0 lol
[20:07:38] Light1stNight: huh does that mean you can mine on the pc change harddrive and get that butcoin on  one harddrive without transfering with wally ?
[20:07:45] ipiv: omie think about this way, if u connect 2 pcs to the same wifi network u dont share a wallet.
[20:07:46] RapidIQ: agreed
[20:07:48] leekillua111: thats makes sense
[20:07:50] rhythm_sk: HACKERMANS
[20:07:54] Codepiled: what is minerext
[20:07:56] brikbeans: mac address get computer i c then crypto gets wallet to send and recieve and u hack the wifi..... i think i c
[20:08:00] lowlyp0p: @Light1stNight if thats the case , thats awesome
[20:08:05] TouchFlick: Keep trying
[20:08:11] TouchFlick: where was he at?
[20:08:12] MozaicDev: @omie try to buy another app and see if it shows your balance
[20:08:16] Jackson0246: hmmm
[20:08:29] Light1stNight: @Light1stNight that would make sense if you get ram racks
[20:08:31] tensaiwow: did you read the salty app?
[20:08:34] luckerooni: i think the literal entire point of wally is to see your ids, rep and move shit and its like a combination of your hacker id and your hacker bank account
[20:08:35] bigmacdogg: Mac address is not unique to a single desk, right? you can have mulitple pcs signed into the same mac address with the same ip which means accessing another's crypto isnt possible
[20:08:47] NoSpacesDan: it seems scuffed
[20:08:49] brikbeans: you're the big dog big dog
[20:08:50] Mr_NoooB487: Copege gotta be
[20:08:50] luckerooni: but i still don't know why it won't show the amount
[20:08:51] sh4gun: maybe miner and wally are both just UI and HDD is the wallet
[20:08:57] Disihe211: WutFace walls of text
[20:08:58] Hiatuz: I dont think the tools are out yet. Because theres not much you can do with a ip adress and mac addres
[20:09:00] Maza_Manny: Ok
[20:09:01] Pure36: So you need the ip4 to use the hacker rn?
[20:09:03] SunGodIX: yea
[20:09:03] Shadowdott: how is the butcoin stored? I didnt think about that. Is it per computer desk or some of the parts?
[20:09:09] fish99: do you think you can see the transaction because you are on the same wifi ?
[20:09:11] andyhlp: yes
[20:09:15] luckerooni: yea it's just unclear labelling it's too vague
[20:09:17] NoDont: i think everything related to pc is so scuffed rn, what ur thinking of is like endgame
[20:09:18] lowlyp0p: @bigmacdogg one pc one mac address. unless there is a modem
[20:09:18] dustyogz: @omie if it was what you were thinking wouldnt there be a way to transfer from your Miner to the walley?
[20:09:19] brikbeans: k
[20:09:21] ipiv: yea that naming is confusing. it should be named to wifi MAC address
[20:09:23] SunGodIX: its very vague
[20:09:23] GeloBongs: TRUEING
[20:09:23] Light1stNight: spoof
[20:09:27] 4_0chillviewer: its too early to know what really happens
[20:09:27] OneHungryBee: OOC i think its harder to code cool things like you think
[20:09:28] Hiatuz: Your wally is your outwards facing mac address i feel like.
[20:09:32] rayhxxn: The only way to figure it out is once you have a second pc connected to wifi
[20:09:32] brikbeans: Hacker MAth

[20:10:13] pleb_jr: chino I call i capuchino
[20:10:13] bigmacdogg: @bigmacdogg you can have 10 pcs all on the same network, which means theyd have to be on the same mac address and ip address

[20:10:27] KiraTypes: what‚Äôs your favorite song atm @omie
[20:10:28] luckerooni: @TheLurkingOne, my suspicion is that's what sniff does
[20:10:29] GeloBongs: buh
[20:10:37] Vallades: Its probably not logical. Just whatever works for balance
[20:10:42] Dragonogs: can u change the licence plate
[20:10:45] veqzei: i c
[20:10:48] zxykm: just because you can hack into someones network doesnt mean you can steal their crypto
[20:10:49] bigmacdogg: @z3hbraw x's group signed into two pcs with the same mac address and ip address
[20:10:51] ipiv: @luckerooni SNIFFA
[20:10:53] besokss: couldn‚Äôt watch the stream, did marty find any investment?
[20:10:53] Light1stNight: also you aren't hacking their pc you are hacking a wifi network their pc was on
[20:11:02] beastm0de423: many pc can connect to the same network with the same mac address so you cant hack other pc through mac
[20:11:03] Shadowdott: mhm maybe
[20:11:04] brikbeans: 5Head
[20:11:07] z3hbraw: @bigmacdogg the mac address changed when they hacked different Wi-Fi‚Äôs
[20:11:14] Validifyed: You cant brute force an external network with a 192 address
[20:11:15] Maza_Manny: lebronJAM
[20:11:18] ketchup__: I wonder if the devs overcomplicated this entire system or it's just a matter of time until everyones got the hang of it
[20:11:22] lowlyp0p: @bigmacdogg regardless , the logic is that is from 1 PC to another PC so 1 mac per PC
[20:11:31] beastm0de423: you are also connecting through your friends mac so you mean he can hack you with that mac?
[20:11:31] nedi_1: @Light1stNight SeemsGood

[20:11:36] muchsauce44: ayoo
[20:11:38] luvvkoa: yes
[20:11:38] Hiatuz: Just because you are on the ip adress and mac adress wouldnt mean you have access to their computer either right. You would still need the physical harddrive
