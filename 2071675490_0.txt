[2:46:59] dqlrk: Did you know Porsche is the only brand that has its ignition on the left side, why? Because Porsche started out as a racing brand for track races and they used to have to hop in the car and start it up then drive so Porsche optimized this by putting it on the left side so when they go inside they can start quickly and take off.
[2:46:59] ArchReaper7: agreed
