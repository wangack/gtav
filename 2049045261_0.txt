[0:10:03] MrYeOLDsNIPeR: Section K can easily be salvaged
[0:10:06] dankNbeans: 1000yd stares is slang for the shellshock that soldiers experience after repeated and prolonged battle.  i'm just joking, bc K was calling for allout war yesterday.

[0:12:03] soothslayerx: What a fucking day LUL what a fucking day
[0:12:05] Rilix: so, probably gonna be difficult to get people to rent houses when they get raided anytime the landlord does something right
[0:12:07] irishmf_24: Typical nopixel harping on 3.0 what you expect from it
[0:12:08] alwaysthefriend_: Dangerous to do anything at the real estate. They will probably raid again
[0:12:19] daskaputtja: Haha, well I usually go by Kaputt but name was taken
[0:12:22] Morfius53_: Whats up Tim and Chat!! timmacWIGGLE timmacWIGGLE

[0:15:33] DTNTBOMB: after 8hrs in jail he was fined and released @Timmac
[0:15:35] Zewelly: mr k refused to leave, he got 8 buses and blocked the doors
[0:15:43] 8R00KS: He made the prison his city LUL
[0:15:44] dankNbeans: he barricaded the prison with like a dozen buses
[0:15:44] Gmoneyusmc: K has a way to turn a bad situation into some good ass RP, don't know how the man does it.
[0:15:46] shoreeee: he may have made the prison his home
[0:15:53] BurpYeah: He started K Town
[0:15:56] Zewelly: ruth power tripping
[0:15:59] icoNic_SwooSh: he's on a 24 hour hold
[0:15:59] nck_at_nite: there's way more to the story than that lol
[0:16:01] beefjerkystickz: yea he was fined 32k
[0:16:02] dankNbeans: he even hosted a wedding in jail, it was nice
[0:16:02] orange51611: he annexed the prison and declared independence, the mayor got married in the temporary city state of K town
[0:16:02] Gmoneyusmc: K town was CRAZY
[0:16:02] soothslayerx: no its bigger
[0:16:05] 8R00KS: He made the cops life hell for the entire time LUL
[0:16:06] irishmf_24: All because they couldn't find his houses he owned
[0:16:06] xxMrGamerBG1xx: 2 days in a row
[0:16:07] dadjustchillin: k locked himself him..declared it kville
[0:16:08] Lepaca: he refused to cooperate so they held him
[0:16:16] soothslayerx: and stupid
[0:16:16] Fossabot: 🚂 Hype Train ENDED! We reached Level 2! Thanks to mskazzeboy for contributing 1 subpoints! <3
[0:16:18] GETAFlX: still makes no sense to raid when they found the pd gun
[0:16:20] Tera: oh dude it was a mess LUL  cops are down bad in a big way it's sad
[0:16:21] bobthegibbon: The PD didnt know that he had to have a tablet for the G6 Truck, so he wasted about 45mins there,
[0:16:24] BiGGHydro: He claimed prison to be his new home,K town, K block etc and he didn't want to leave
[0:16:26] Steelhuf: @Timmac they know were the house was but they wanted him to mark it and he wouldnt so they put him on a 24hr hold
[0:16:28] GoAskAlice91: they were being spiteful af
[0:16:29] BrodieBlue: held pending raid.
[0:16:29] bobthegibbon: They thought he was lying about the truck,
[0:16:32] macabrius: The Rp was good but he was pissed. u could see in his face
[0:16:34] AyyJamezz: he made prison, also known a k-block also known as k-town also known as k-ville his own city
[0:16:35] 8R00KS: It was insane
[0:16:39] RaptorQuiz: The cops literally didn't know how to find the houses by their addresses. Literally no clue what to do.
[0:16:46] bobthegibbon: Then shortly after it, they raided 1 of his houses and he refused to tell them where the others werer
[0:16:49] MrYeOLDsNIPeR: "He refused to do their job for them" and i would hardly call that being "Uncooperative"
[0:16:51] shadowcaster209: Gomer missed a crazy day
[0:16:51] gumpZ__: They had the address, its because he didnt mark it and show them where the house was even though they had the addresses
[0:16:52] tinydemian: yeah cause ruth said he wasn't "cooperating"
[0:16:52] irishmf_24: Held him for bullshit and raided everything and then released him 8 hours later
[0:16:55] Jessimi: You're going to get some mixed info Timmac . The cops side vs K's side had vastly different views on things.
[0:16:57] daskaputtja: Barricaded the gates with 8 buses, Dab got married in the prison, K refused to leave prison so slacks and cornwood got him removed :D
[0:16:58] ChjezBunga: The rp from some cops were questionable
[0:17:04] Gmoneyusmc: he refused to cooperate... IE he wouldn't tell them which houses was his, and tried to make them do some brain thinking. so Ruth went on a power trip and put him 24 hour hold...
[0:17:04] macabrius: yup
[0:17:04] NimmaC8: hell week inc
[0:17:10] bobthegibbon: There is no in game mechanic for them to find the houses
[0:17:13] tinydemian: pretty much yeah
[0:17:15] BurpYeah: He is on a warpath against Capt Ruth
[0:17:18] goondock9: it was hard to watch haha
[0:17:22] nck_at_nite: you know for sure k was giving them hell but they made it way worse for themselves the entire time
[0:17:25] irishmf_24: @chjezbunga Beyond questionable the cops are corrupt af
[0:17:31] Tera: yeah they couldn't find them LUL
[0:17:34] nck_at_nite: the real estate app doesn't show sold property now though
[0:17:35] Gmoneyusmc: Ruth life is going to be HELL today....
[0:17:35] 8R00KS: 5x vandalism KEKW
[0:17:36] Cypher_5: 9s for not cooperating LUL
[0:17:37] macabrius: so PD thinks suspects have the obligation to tell where they live to raid their houses
[0:17:40] soothslayerx: 2 missing
[0:17:42] TTNuge: they couldn't figure out which one was Grove 10 and KJ wouldn't tell em
[0:17:48] gumpZ__: Because they didnt know how to use a tablet
[0:17:48] RaptorQuiz: They literally didn't know how to find the houses because they weren't listed in the app. So they didn't know how to get there. None of them.
[0:17:58] bobthegibbon: Thats what K said,
[0:17:59] iSTuBBZz: they wanted k to physically take them to all doors was crazy
[0:17:59] 8R00KS: You can just click it and it marks it
[0:18:00] nck_at_nite: LOL YOU DID WHAT THEY COULDNT DO
[0:18:02] Tera: logic, amirite?
[0:18:02] tinydemian: too much thinking for them
[0:18:04] xxMrGamerBG1xx: the have been in the house before but all of a sudden don’t know were it is
[0:18:07] Lepaca: PD cant risk going in to the wrong house
[0:18:07] Gmoneyusmc: EXACTLY WHAT HE KEPT TELLING THEM TO DO! @Timmac  IT WAS HILLARIOUS
[0:18:10] bobthegibbon: The PD argued that it opened them up to illegal search complaints
[0:18:11] irishmf_24: They wanted everything on a silver platter from K for a raid but he wasn't giving them shiii
[0:18:11] BigglesVII: They couldnt figure out to use a tablet with the property app. Plus none of them had a tablet
[0:18:11] MrCythe: no stop, you’re making too much sense
[0:18:12] Jessimi: Exactly. They couldn't do that LUL
[0:18:14] shadowcaster209: Yah yhats all they had to do but didn't want to do it.
[0:18:15] DTNTBOMB: @Timmac no it was because the murphey trial toook to long and the verdick of that would either in fav for him  or aggainst him
[0:18:16] DESHAWNTE: @TTNuge Lol
[0:18:19] shoreeee: logic was not there
[0:18:19] theonyxedition: It was straight comedy last night with the raids
[0:18:20] appleceee: thats exactly wat K  said but they were just dumb
[0:18:20] inFamousKC: k tried to tell them that
[0:18:21] dankNbeans: you explained in ten seconds what cops took six hours to execute, it was messy lol
[0:18:21] tupacmak1: that alone took 2 hours to figure out LUL
[0:18:22] Funami: this is what K told them KEKW
[0:18:25] GETAFlX: they arent detectives chat, just cops. game is hard
[0:18:27] gumpZ__: Capt Ruth is a moron.
[0:18:32] Hey_its_Mady: Stop Timmac you are making too much sense right now
[0:18:35] ItsAllDestiny: It was crazy bro, from the start they were being fucked about it, calling a judge down to give contempt for not pulling a work vehicle out. Just kept going down hill lol
[0:18:35] 88eg: morning mac
[0:18:35] McNugg33t: Ruth was on the struggle bus yesterday for sure
[0:18:37] Zewelly: It just doesnt make sense how MR K got charged when he was shot, told them it was Mary and Yeagar and was GSR negative. Its jsut bad RP and power tripping just like pred in 3.0
[0:18:37] irishmf_24: Be careful cops will arrest you for doing too much thinking
[0:18:39] orange51611: I dont think deduction is in the SOPs
[0:18:40] SnapnColoPics: daft punk so good
[0:18:45] shadowcaster209: They wanted him.to.do their job for them. He said "I will tell.you if you tell me that you need me to do your job.for you"
[0:18:52] DESHAWNTE: @8R00KS lol
[0:18:57] SnapnColoPics: that whole album is gold
[0:18:57] mizledTV: Their argument was they couldn't verify that was the correct house
[0:19:10] BurpYeah: not for long
[0:19:10] Morfius53_: They stated they wanted Mr K's cooperation to make sure they had the correct house and didnt enter someones else house by mistake. Honestly, common sense yea, shouldnt be too hard to figure out though.
[0:19:14] tinydemian: they found that house easily wonder how LUL
[0:19:14] Dieson75: Can you filter to sold where it says price
[0:19:14] nck_at_nite: but they never drove him to the estimated location and asked him to show them which
[0:19:18] Edge4L: he need to transfer some property to u
[0:19:19] BurpYeah: K evicted him lol
[0:19:20] shadowcaster209: It was insanely crazy bro
[0:19:21] RisKkeyy: Ruth was trying to say they need to be 100% sure so they don't go in the wrong house
[0:19:21] kuhwit: you're using common sense
[0:19:22] 8R00KS: He was marking Mary's house on Jamestown LUL
[0:19:25] nck_at_nite: they just sat at a corner and said take us there
[0:19:29] irishmf_24: His houses are on his profile FFS they are dumb af pd corrupt af
[0:19:31] soothslayerx: thing was if they raided and found stuff at another unrelated property,
[0:19:32] RisKkeyy: But yeah its dumb
[0:19:37] GoAskAlice91: cops made a lot of mistakes the night that Kay was originally shot and arrested. thats where it all started.
[0:19:41] Jessimi: That's what they did in the end. A judge or someone sent Slacks pictures.
[0:19:42] iCLUTCH193: They say you cant see sold properties on the real estate app now
[0:19:45] RaptorQuiz: They literally had the addresses and none of them could figure out any possible way to find the houses. It was unreal.
[0:19:50] woodywiththehoodie: Ramee calling slacks telling him hes getting raided clean his house had me crying
[0:19:51] goondock9: they found 3 items
[0:19:52] soothslayerx: yea
[0:19:53] nck_at_nite: you're too smart, man
[0:19:54] onewipecharlie: eventually they got pics from crane
[0:19:59] Jasonam8: Cops even blew up a tanker yesterday and killed a couple
[0:20:00] mystic_mic: very true
[0:20:06] daskaputtja: Timmac for PD Captain
[0:20:07] soothslayerx: it was a shit show
[0:20:07] shadowcaster209: The way they arrested him was bad too. But I don't wanna meta
[0:20:08] Zewelly: arrest timmac, hes thinking
[0:20:09] RisKkeyy: EXACTLY WHAT K WAS SAYING LOL
[0:20:11] Funami: they had him sign in to all jobs as well was crazy
[0:20:11] Steelhuf: @ ruth is crazy
[0:20:12] dankNbeans: oh the raid itself had its own drama
[0:20:14] nck_at_nite: of their own time
[0:20:15] GETAFlX: they couldnt raid him , so they locked on an indefinate hold
[0:20:18] xxMrGamerBG1xx: the grime 6 part to was crazy
[0:20:19] RisKkeyy: Do your damn job
[0:20:20] BurpYeah: it was pretty crazy
[0:20:20] nck_at_nite: there were like 6 of them constantly involved
[0:20:21] Cypher_5: that’s why they gave him the 9s when they couldnt find it
[0:20:21] Steelhuf: @Timmac Can i post a clip?
[0:20:21] StreamElements: TTours If you see something funny, exciting or otherwise interesting on stream... CLIP IT and post it in the #twitch-clips channel on our Discord! https://discord.gg/timmac timmacE
[0:20:22] onewipecharlie: it was a mess
[0:20:23] IgnicityTV: lets be real - they rushed the charge and raid
[0:20:23] McNugg33t: K is on a kill all cops arc now
[0:20:23] Rhizwynd: demon K back
[0:20:23] coffeeatm: @Timmac Slack was confused to why the pd did not listen to him when said were it was.
[0:20:28] berfsta82: the best part was he was having the time of his life riling them up

[0:20:32] Jessimi: It was pretty bad, honestly.
[0:20:35] Zewelly: arrest timmac, hes thinking. thats not allowed
[0:20:36] bobthegibbon: The main issue with the raid is that he managed to get under the skin of Officer Viv,
[0:20:41] effervescentmango: they've raided other people - how did they find their houses? Was it maybe only apartments before?
[0:20:41] Bwabwa0201: 4.0 cop its literally -iq LUL
[0:20:42] GoAskAlice91: you could tell they had no idea how to do a raid
[0:20:46] bobthegibbon: once that happened she was determined to hold him as a punishment
[0:20:48] BigglesVII: They just need to learn how to do it properly going forward. Although it should have been planned better before starting raids
[0:20:48] RisKkeyy: It was petty as fuck what they did
[0:20:58] HughHeppner: you had any run ins with Ruth?
[0:20:59] Steelhuf: @Timmac https://clips.twitch.tv/ObservantComfortableRutabagaPipeHype-mW9oSKNX-iRhsI5w
[0:20:59] Gmoneyusmc: Yeah... the cops fucked up and brought out the DEMON today.....
[0:21:01] RaptorQuiz: Mr K made Ruth so mad she totally broke RP and in the middle of talking just sent him to prison lol
[0:21:06] MONSTERSbruh: K savagely grilled them so hard, they just stopped listening to anything he said.
[0:21:08] WIHEEILS25: yea it was a crazy lazy mess and the only one that seemed to have any smarts was Cornwood
[0:21:11] SparkPJ: morning Tmac how you doing?
[0:21:13] boss_waka: he was pissed cause he feels like hes benn treated as 3.0 k from the start
[0:21:13] soothslayerx: It's all too soon tbh with the guns and shit
[0:21:14] daskaputtja: They also raided without K or his lawyer there which iirc is illegal right ?
[0:21:19] RaptorQuiz: Roger
[0:21:20] shadowcaster209: Yah that didn't happen raptor
[0:21:21] Lepaca: @RaptorQuiz straight up lies
[0:21:24] itisacar: it was funny when they got stuck in the trap door for like 30 minutes
[0:21:25] BrodieBlue: the whole thing was very disappointing. 4.0 pd was supposed to be better this time round.
[0:21:26] 8R00KS: And he knows what hes doing playing mental gymnastics with them
[0:21:26] nck_at_nite: he was being difficult but only because they were being incompetent
[0:21:36] Tera: K called Slacks and evicted him at the end of his stream @Timmac  LUL
[0:21:43] RisKkeyy: The phone thing at g6 was the worst. Ruth tried to get judge Gatsby down there and give him contempt of court
[0:21:44] 8R00KS: K is smart af
[0:21:44] shoreeee: i was entertained. :)
[0:21:45] BurpYeah: so you give him the 9's nah
[0:21:56] Rhizwynd: Have you heard IC about the Murphy case?
[0:21:56] Fatass_Drew: Karen K is fucking hilarious, yesterday was some of the funniest shit ive seen from k in awhile.
[0:22:03] theonyxedition: They are unleashing the dragon from 3.0 lmao
[0:22:06] nck_at_nite: no one on pd would realize that he would have chilled if they would have just said "yea we should have interrogated yaegar and mary after you claim they shot you"
[0:22:06] SparkPJ: regardless of how you feel about Ruth righht, the way i view it is 'what RP comes from this?' and Ruth is opening up a fucking massive gate of good future RP
[0:22:06] Morfius53_: Also the fact that the pd arent even trying to investigate the other parties (as far as I know) that were involved is what really made this a huge deal in the first place. Just automatically make K out to be the bad guy
[0:22:10] tinydemian: it was probably the most hectic stream in 4.0 so far
[0:22:11] ViewbotReportingforDuty: @BrodieBlue Old timers barely get the PD job back. They want new faces
[0:22:12] shadowcaster209: It was just insanely crazy rp bro
[0:22:13] SparkPJ: we need a villain Ruth is that
[0:22:15] Jessimi: All over a Frisk they shouldn't have done while he was bleeding out on the ground.
[0:22:21] WIHEEILS25: yep K is like you don't make me bend over I make you bend over lol
[0:22:21] IgnicityTV: today's gunna be a trip
[0:22:22] dankNbeans: just sell Cop House and go buy that shiny new Pounder truck you've been wanting
[0:22:24] Cypher_5: if K was a cop he would do every inverstigation to find a house and not depend on mechanic. just saying
[0:22:28] shadowcaster209: Hahahahhahahahaha
[0:22:29] MONSTERSbruh: K has always said "It's their job to get me. It's my job to make that as difficult as possible for them."
[0:22:30] coffeeatm: The Sith lord admiral Crane is gone look into the warrants they issued on K
[0:22:31] 0616zz: k
[0:22:31] alwaysthefriend_: Thank you

[0:28:39] woodywiththehoodie: Juicers and cg community both getting upset on the same day was probably the worst possible thing to happen
[0:28:42] mystic_mic: not all have enjoyed Barny Miller
[0:28:52] payto__: this happens every wipe. cops always start very strict and loosen up over time.
[0:28:52] Morfius53_: @Jessimi yeah. it's sad that this happens to them.
[0:28:57] moiborg: idk I feel like it's going back to ruleplay over roleplay and it sucks
[0:28:58] nova_rubio: Timmac’s take timmacH timmacH timmacH timmacH
[0:29:07] Jessimi: 0616zz FailFish
[0:29:11] omascas: and she does it while taking care of her kids too
[0:29:13] thunderthunderthundercats: leadership should take the blame
[0:29:15] DrCached: @0616zz RIPBOZO
[0:29:20] p7ulcs: RIPBOZO
[0:29:23] itsloonuh: idc I feel like she has more knowledge than K does on the laws in play right now. she got loopholes like K does
[0:29:24] Rhizwynd: Isn't it good for the PD that Ruth gets all the blame?
[0:29:24] Donkey__Teeth: GIGAMODS
[0:29:27] Yerps2g: gomer yesterday was craziest day of 4.0
[0:29:48] soothslayerx: by the actual books character
[0:29:50] Jessimi: Cornwood was hilarious. He's like: "I took ONE day off... WTF happened??"
[0:29:53] surgical_scope00: Just strange that mr.k didn't have a warrant then gets cooked then suddenly gets a warrant
[0:29:53] Tera: eh, it's more than that but if K gets on he can fill you in
[0:29:59] Aneemix: The character is covering for incompetence though
[0:30:02] Cypher_5: this is Mr k’s ruthless character coming out
[0:30:02] Kxart: Ruth made herself the target to let the other officers do their jobs
[0:30:18] donsol88: The problem with RUTH is that on multiple insidents, she is biased against one side
[0:30:18] Steelhuf: @Timmac K's issue was he was giving legal aid to Dundee and she processed the warrant when he was there and cuffed him
[0:30:20] kinky_kangarooo: & in all the crazyness there was even a wedding at the prison
[0:30:20] Kdkuiper: she even told slacks, i started talking to K again when he would start shit talking other cops so he would shift all his anger at just me
[0:30:21] BigglesVII: Yeah it allows the officers to focus on the job better
[0:30:28] theonyxedition: Best quote from yesterday "There is a nice spot next to Sam Baas grave" - Mr. K
[0:30:29] lIREXIl: k was mad at Ruth because she pushed a warrant while k was being a paralegal for Dundee
[0:30:30] moiborg: only cop I've seen get punished is den shiesty like in 3.0 was the only one ever getting punished for roleplay LUL

[0:30:38] DESHAWNTE: @Cypher_5 I wish he joined PD at the beginning of 4.0 K and ramee make money and have a gun
[0:31:02] Jessimi: Exactly
[0:31:03] donsol88: Ruth is a good  cop, she just needs to chill a  bit
[0:31:08] dhanaz: yea thats maybe the core issue in this case
[0:31:09] nick_dr1ft: have you seen the clip? just got here
[0:31:09] StreamElements: TTours If you see something funny, exciting or otherwise interesting on stream... CLIP IT and post it in the #twitch-clips channel on our Discord! https://discord.gg/timmac timmacE
[0:31:14] xxMrGamerBG1xx: they acted dumb lol who were when how
[0:31:14] DESHAWNTE: @Funami o7 to the bus lol
[0:31:14] seamus_souleater: Yeah they just tunneled on K and Ramee, that is the biggest issue I think
[0:31:16] AyyJamezz: the clip of cornwood giving K his sim card back after he gets out of jail and seeing a gun on him already was hilarious
[0:31:16] GETAFlX: @Timmac why did they raid if they found the gun
[0:31:16] bigfoot7802: thats why they were so pissed. Not so much the frisk, its that they didn't go after the other ones running away
[0:31:27] ExessiveGK: I disagree with how the PD is being run, but why is this even a discussion in your stream, you shouldn't have to explain anything
[0:31:31] MrCythe: 2 cop cars pulled up as a bike and car were driving away
[0:31:34] Jessimi: GETAFlX To look for more PD weapons
[0:31:38] Kdkuiper: yeah K understands why he would get raided for the gun, but them only listening to one side and not going after anyone else is whats upsetting
[0:31:45] thunderthunderthundercats: to late now they had time to get rid of evidence
[0:31:48] gamesbychaz: i think k is super frustrated that the real estate business isn’t getting taken seriously too, he seemed really defeated yesterday
[0:31:49] BurpYeah: yeah K was more pissed on the way he was treated and how they handled the situation
[0:31:49] nick_dr1ft: @GETAFlX because every time pd guns were stolen, other equipment was as well
[0:31:53] GETAFlX: @Jessimi on what basis?
[0:32:05] theonyxedition: THey said they were
[0:32:05] p7ulcs: An almost like for like situation happened with X at the same time yesterday
[0:32:07] xxMrGamerBG1xx: easy targets while down
[0:32:08] Jessimi: GETAFlX If they find one, they have the right to raid to see if there are more.
[0:32:12] GETAFlX: @nick_dr1ft so they just assumed?
[0:32:17] bigfoot7802: true
[0:32:17] moiborg: I mean pursuing 3 days later is pointless
[0:32:21] soothslayerx: the  other side is ?
[0:32:23] nick_dr1ft: @GETAFlX yup, they even said so
[0:32:24] shoreeee: i guess the fuel to the fire for K was that  they didn't show their hand to K
[0:32:26] Yerps2g: i mean they spent 8h with k in jail to "raid his properties" and found nothing
[0:32:26] WarrenPuffit: jager tweeting a picture of Richard’s dead body right after and the police didn’t see it
[0:32:28] Kkaedal: But shouldn't they finish their investigation before arresting and raiding to prove the gun wasn't planted
[0:32:29] DESHAWNTE: @Edge4L ❤️❤️
[0:32:31] Lepaca: PD is severly understaffed and a fair bit undertrained for what they want in the new direction
[0:32:33] Kdkuiper: exactly, its his POV that makes him upset over it
[0:32:35] tinydemian: the cops kinda fucked up by not following the cars that left but ruth did great at taking all the heat on herself and as much as i dislike the character she does her job well
[0:32:42] dankNbeans: well, the Murphy court case verdict didn't help anything. i thought K was actually gonna back down, then that dropped.
[0:32:43] MrYeOLDsNIPeR: he’s also saying, “don’t fine me until the court case has been resolved.”
[0:32:44] 55Hoes: @timmac bro why even open up this ooc podcast discussion? lets grind
[0:32:45] johnnytwotimed: Yesterday was wild thats all i got to say about it lmao
[0:32:48] seamus_souleater: My character found a photo of Mary and one of the other people outside of PD. So now I guess I'm part of this story some how which is cool.
[0:32:48] TexasOnTop: A week to hide everything tho is lame
[0:32:50] xxMrGamerBG1xx: second time yager tweeted killing Richard lol
[0:32:52] Jessimi: The biggest thing K was pissed about, was them not following up on the Shooters side.
[0:33:05] woodywiththehoodie: Oh no not "looking into it" lol
[0:33:09] MysteriousDreams: I think she put a warrant on K when he was working with Ramee inside PD
[0:33:12] DishDawg: K is mostly pissed because Ruth wrote the warrant while he was being legal aide for Dundee in the cells.
[0:33:13] bigfoot7802: the clip last night of K going back to PD after everything and cornwood "looking" in his pockets was hysterical!
[0:33:14] xxMrGamerBG1xx: kebunBwain kebunBwain kebunBwain kebunBwain
[0:33:21] MysteriousDreams: Trapping basically
[0:33:26] Cypher_5: I think K was annoyed when they couldn’t find the houses, when he could do it even without a tablet by just investigation RP
[0:33:26] MrCythe: where’s shiesty when you need him
[0:33:27] ExessiveGK: there putting in a order to require a license to buy bullets, untill guns come in so even if you rob a cop now lol
[0:33:30] LuckyNZ: The only solution is Gomer head of PD
[0:33:31] lertygames: MAY I ASK WHAT U LOST DURING THE RAID
[0:33:34] 8R00KS: I feel like robbing PD guns just shouldnt be a thing tbh its just a can of worms that isnt necessary at this point in time
[0:33:44] Steelhuf: @Timmac Its because K ratted and said they have full guns in their house and they didn't call for any raid or anything for Mary thats his problem with it
[0:33:44] DrCached: @LuckyNZ NODDERS The only solution is Gomer head of PD
[0:33:45] johnnytwotimed: @MysteriousDreams According to Ruth it was coincidental and it just happened to be when the warrant got pushed through
[0:33:47] seamus_souleater: My character found a photo of Mary and one of the other people outside of PD. So now I guess I'm part of this story some how which is cool. 󠀀
[0:33:48] Jessimi: lertygames Nothing
[0:33:48] Kkaedal: The 1st guy on scene omitted the fact that people were holding up ramee at the beginning in his report because he forgot what happened
[0:33:48] xxMrGamerBG1xx: cornwood is the only chill cop
[0:33:49] muppetfartt: the lack of legislation in the city is hurting the situation too
[0:33:51] dankNbeans: a dozen cops policing a 200 slot server is crazy
[0:33:55] gamesbychaz: there’s normally not enough crime to need that many more officers, but something like this happens at the wrong time and it stinks
[0:33:56] lertygames: JUST REALLY CURIOUS HOW MUCH IT SET U BACK UNO
[0:33:58] hicks9897: I think they clear all houses
[0:33:59] DishDawg: nothing was lost, everything was moved.
[0:33:59] nick_dr1ft: tbh not a single part of the K incident was handled fully as it should, so especially from his pov it looks insanely bad
[0:33:59] Yerps2g: lost 3 splints lol
[0:34:01] halos420: @lertygames pretty much nothing at all it was cleaned already
[0:34:01] BigglesVII: Its was minor items splints and IV bag
[0:34:03] kvnater: Since DNA is on everything you touch they can tell that the gun wasnt planted on a person. that what they got murphy on
[0:34:03] RisKkeyy: Yeah did you see the clip of cornwood at pd after k got released?
[0:34:04] FatttGuyLilCoat: @bigfoot7802 i was laughing so hard omg
[0:34:09] LuckyNZ: fair
[0:34:11] 8R00KS: 100%
[0:34:13] kuhwit: trueeeeeeeeeee
[0:34:14] p7ulcs: will Gomer go demon time if K is?
[0:34:15] lertygames: amazing
[0:34:16] Kdkuiper: no guns in the city right now would be amazing
[0:34:17] LuckyNZ: tazer is essentially the same agaisnt a knife
[0:34:19] 8R00KS: Its not necessary
[0:34:20] sexy_peach_on_twitch: naaa
[0:34:23] TexasOnTop: not wrong
[0:34:28] Roc525: i agree, or made it a rule break to rob cops
[0:34:30] Morfius53_: Get rid of guns, go tazers only! timmacLUL
[0:34:35] DrCached: W Timmac Take Pog W Timmac Take Pog W Timmac Take Pog W Timmac Take Pog W Timmac Take Pog
[0:34:43] sexy_peach_on_twitch: ah 0 guns in the city sounds cool
[0:34:50] LuckyNZ: @Morfius53_ honestly an awesome idea considering how many great RPers are on NP
[0:34:52] ExessiveGK: you can have a rock though and if thats all there is , it ill still be a problem it is what it is
[0:34:52] StreamElements: The thing is, you're like a brother to me, but at the end of the day, when it's all said and done, business is business, and not for nothing, it is what it is and that's that.
[0:34:58] DESHAWNTE: @Edge4L k can't have a key if that's the case they will raid the house if they find a key on him that's my guess

[0:37:55] Jessimi: Hype!!
[0:37:57] BurpYeah: K needs to pay investors and lost his money with that fine
[0:37:58] Jasonam8: That moment is quickly approaching
[0:38:00] donsol88: @Timmac  thats the risk of rolling with CG bro, you wake up to a raid!!!!

[0:38:29] SparkPJ: actually curious of your opinion, do you think CG is weaker this time around? they lost a lot of members
[0:38:30] jumdeez: waking up to being raided... sounds like rust
[0:38:34] ExessiveGK: @haunevie thats RP, all K lost was the investment money he still has 3k in his bak
[0:38:52] donsol88: @SparkPJ they are way weaker
[0:38:52] ExessiveGK: "bank"
[0:39:03] spartacus1j: what classifies something as a lootbox? Someone was just banned for strategically robbing a cop and getting away
[0:39:05] bigfoot7802: Can I post a link of when K went back to pd to get his sim card from Cornwood after he was let out?
[0:39:15] Steelhuf: I think all crews are at a weak spot right now
[0:39:16] haunevie: @ExessiveGK na i mean why is gomer talking about loosing his career?
[0:39:17] donsol88: @donsol88 CG has lost most of their shooters though
[0:39:20] Lepaca: @SgtHeadbuster timmacCRINGE
[0:39:28] SparkPJ: i guess like, they lost their grinders Arya, Zolo, Curtis, etc are all gone most of their shooters are gone
[0:39:30] p7ulcs: Clueless
[0:39:31] pigscanflyhigh: KEKW ahahahaa
[0:39:31] Gmoneyusmc: i'm loving the no guns meta so far
[0:39:38] gamesbychaz: ??
[0:39:39] 8R00KS: K is a mastermind thats the biggest asset
[0:39:41] LuckyNZ: lol did you guys not see K headshot that guy last week - HE ON FIRE
[0:39:42] BurpYeah: yeah I would rather there be no guns at all
[0:39:43] GoAskAlice91: everyone is technically weaker this time in terms of economy finances. but CG is still the biggest and most organized.
[0:39:53] shoreeee: agreed
[0:39:53] gumpZ__: The admins mad it where you cant buy ammo any more for now.
[0:39:53] thunderthunderthundercats: 4.0 frames when you go near a house
[0:40:03] gumpZ__: made*
[0:40:10] SparkPJ: so you'd say overall, no they aren't weaker because shooters dont matter :P ?
[0:40:16] Gmoneyusmc: I like that its a heavy risk of getting raided and 30k fine for PD glock.
[0:40:17] ExessiveGK: they opening the server when they weren't ready too, they should of did a soft open to get the doj established if you wan to talk real

[0:43:37] itisacar: anotha one
[0:43:51] killogic916: If its an extra step hopefully its a lot more $$.
[0:43:56] gamesbychaz: good lordy lord
[0:44:00] LuckyNZ: @Jasonam8  it was a new gun - cornwood searched him without asking when giving sim back
[0:44:01] killogic916: like 4k per car or somtrhin
[0:44:03] forfiet: @jasonam8 Ramee had one stashed and he remembered it’s in some tree so they found it
[0:44:33] bigfoot7802: @Jasonam8  cornwood "looked" into his pockets, and K already had another PD glock on him! KEKW. but RP wise cornwood didn't see it, because he was just messing around to se what he had.

[0:50:31] BigglesVII: The broader issue with real estate now is it will put people off renting if the landlord can cause the property to be search out of the tenants control and they have dodgy stuff in the house.
[0:50:35] WhoKnowz21: @SparkPJ yes, rdm is random death match like gta online
[0:50:47] macabrius: true

[0:51:09] TheEternaIMan: looking back probably should have kept money in your account lol
[0:51:15] Aneemix: I guess people put money in there to avoid fines
[0:51:16] killogic916: @Timmac Crane said they didnt want shared account or easy access to 2nd accounts because it was just a gang money laundering issue
[0:51:24] MONSTERSbruh: It's so difficult for citizens to be self-reliant right now
[0:51:25] killogic916: in 3.0
[0:51:29] ExessiveGK: the economy is running of the state account now, only income it has is taxes and car sales, they need  businesses
[0:51:37] macabrius: thats the problem, they know shit about the bussiness

[0:52:20] LtMackAttack: K told Slacks that he owes 30K for damages to the property and evicted. As K left the PD after picking up his stuff from Cornwood.
[0:52:21] hopalong92: You are not wrong
[0:52:24] ExessiveGK: kebunCry kebunCry kebunCry kebunCry
[0:52:24] BiGGHydro: Koil doesn't want everyone to have businesses like in 3.0 but idk

[0:52:46] dankNbeans: dude that whole raid was hilarious

[0:52:51] thee_lakershow: LUL
[0:52:56] ExessiveGK: MMPD 4LIFE

[0:53:02] Gmoneyusmc: they ALMOST didn't find the basement! @Timmac
[0:53:02] Jessimi: "Oh" lmao
[0:53:04] Kermamakkara: they spent so fucking long there trying to get everyone out
[0:53:07] boss_waka: bahahhaha
[0:53:21] ThePatKing: at least the trap worked
[0:53:28] emrejonson: yeah they saw the bench from 2nd floor, since there was no flooring
[0:53:28] dankNbeans: imagine if the fire trap was still there LOL
[0:53:29] halos420: They found it only because the floors weren't finished behing the bushes
[0:53:32] Jessimi: The trap was the funniest part of yesterday
[0:53:33] halos420: Behind
[0:53:34] wibs14: they left a barrier in there for you guys too! LUL
[0:53:35] nick_dr1ft: @Gmoneyusmc clip
[0:53:42] ItsJoey_E: because they could see the downstairs through the no floors over bench
[0:53:43] LtMackAttack: K told Slacks that he owes 30K for damages to the property and evicted. As K left the PD after picking up his stuff from Cornwood.
[0:53:48] steffan_cbs: but find nothing  :))
[0:53:52] bigfoot7802: they saw the pc and the bench becuase the floors weren't finished
[0:54:01] dubo18: it happen to Tommy t yesterday before the search
[0:54:13] ThePatKing: did not prioritize security rip
[0:54:14] xl_scout_lx: @Timmac remember when you were messing with the how the house loads the other day? They were able to see the basement from the second floor while looking at the wall thats under the door
[0:54:15] emrejonson: go straight to the bushes
[0:54:16] iCLUTCH193: above the workbench
[0:54:17] Azzarill: one of the cop was going in and out if the bushes ???
[0:54:17] WhoKnowz21: at the back wall
[0:54:18] Jessimi: There is a gap in the bushes that you can see down.
[0:54:20] wibs14: go to the left and look down
[0:54:21] TigerHeli79: they could see through the bushes
[0:54:21] ExessiveGK: only part I don't get, they played out the RP for so long on house locations and went and did it anyways
[0:54:22] vi_horrors: like the back wall
[0:54:22] reaves75stl: dont attach gomers decorating
[0:54:23] francewon_: when you walk up to the edges of the grass you can look down
[0:54:24] bigfoot7802: or bugged, but they could see from the second floor
[0:54:27] Jessimi: Right side I think?
[0:54:31] macabrius: u can talk with investors and make slacks house rent to own, will be extra money weekly
[0:54:36] Jessimi: Yep
[0:54:38] fragileaudium: it is what it is
[0:54:38] StreamElements: The thing is, you're like a brother to me, but at the end of the day, when it's all said and done, business is business, and not for nothing, it is what it is and that's that.
[0:54:46] ItsJoey_E: lol
[0:54:46] Crazybro: tbh if they didnt see that they wouldnt have kept searching prolly
[0:54:50] LuckyNZ: such a stupid design, just make an invisible door
[0:54:52] redbeerdx: Yeah thats exactly how it went down, how you approached it lol
[0:54:53] bigfoot7802: they would have never found the hole if they couldn't see them
[0:54:54] halos420: Nah it's all Vinny's fault let's be real
[0:54:56] Jessimi: Vinny and Paris fairDesk KEKW
[0:55:05] iCLUTCH193: They may have found the drop down anyways but that was what they found first.
[0:55:07] xxMrGamerBG1xx: ask k who did wu Chang studio way better designer
[0:55:08] Gmoneyusmc: they legit thought there was only 2 floors at the start.

[0:56:06] ThePatKing: security is paramount for next time
[0:56:09] Azzarill: need a secret room for the weed ?
[0:56:13] xl_scout_lx: Just need to change it to a new rat way to enter
[0:56:17] redbeerdx: Now you can just do regular stairs down there right?
[0:56:23] Froseti: hmm could give investors who only invested to be on the list for new rent to owns, first pick
[0:56:26] BurpYeah: LUL
[0:56:35] ExessiveGK: hahahaha "take the shot"
[0:56:36] redbeerdx: heater traps throughout the house
[0:56:37] Jmannice: XDDDDD
[0:56:43] mauled: KEKW
[0:56:52] nick_dr1ft: @Timmac since their reasoning for the warrent and search are nulled, it should not be official anywhere, also K is able to sue them for a lot, guess we will just wait and see tho
[0:57:06] BurpYeah: watching cornwood jiggle is too funny
[0:57:20] xxMrGamerBG1xx: did they raid wu Chang records
[0:57:22] dankNbeans: Cornwood was hilarious just looking around like, "can I have stuff like this?"
[0:57:25] reaves75stl: gatsby
[0:57:26] halos420: If the real estate thing goes belly up and they claim the contracts are useless because of the lack of laws, I could see Mr k keeping everyone's mondy
[0:57:26] saltdalt: yeah
[0:57:30] emrejonson: yes
[0:57:32] Rambler: more pd guns yeah
[0:57:33] Kermamakkara: tasers and shit
[0:57:36] ExessiveGK: police equipment
[0:57:37] saltdalt: stolen cop gear
[0:57:38] steffan_cbs: nope
[0:57:41] dankNbeans: the warrant was for any additional government property
[0:57:41] RisKkeyy: Pd equipment
[0:57:44] redbeerdx: Yeah, they have missing tasers and stuff still they are looking for
[0:57:46] nick_dr1ft: yeah but it never shown and the base of all of this is also full of PD wrongdoing
[0:57:47] 8R00KS: Just because you have a gun doesnt mean you have more pd stuff that logic is wild to me
[0:57:48] vi_horrors: their scope was pd equipment guns or tasers
[0:57:51] jsouza31: ya they were looking for more equipment
[0:57:51] MrCythe: apparently crane wasn’t happy with the search warrant
[0:57:52] bobthegibbon: So from what was said last night, A PD issued tazer was stolen at the same time as the gun,
[0:57:53] pigscanflyhigh: reason was  "people who steal PD guns also steal other PD stuff."
[0:57:54] Azzarill: wait till vinny finds out they raided him lol
[0:57:55] HeirtoDoom: they said that people usually take more then just the gun so they had to search
[0:57:56] BigglesVII: Because every cop getting robbed had more than a gun taken they were looking for equipment.
[0:58:01] bobthegibbon: So they were looking for the other stuff that was stolen
[0:58:03] R3dl1nes: it had no S/N on it
[0:58:07] Smartyfool: Yes police gear because they said usually they take more pd stuff then just the gun
[0:58:10] MistressGayle: @8r00ks they are raid happy
[0:58:15] redbeerdx: Makes sense, but thats how they are doing it now
[0:58:15] mystic_mic: scope
[0:58:19] ExessiveGK: their logic is if a cop was robbed the criminal took all the equipment even if it wasn't taken
[0:58:23] halos420: @bobthegibbon he knew it was happening
[0:58:23] TigerHeli79: we all know it was a witch hunt
[0:58:23] LostInPixelation: They were totally using it as an excuse thinking they'd find the 2nd gun peanut stole
[0:58:25] steffan_cbs: they did
[0:58:27] dankNbeans: the Murphy court case was WILD
[0:58:29] Cypher_5: they based it on mechanic
[0:58:30] spartacus1j: you know how many streams ive seen where they find guns/tasers/pd equipment and no warrant filed? It seems very biased
[0:58:35] emrejonson: they are tring to get all the guns back, I think 6 left in the streets. 1 without serial numbers 5 with
[0:58:37] Cypher_5: and not rp
[0:58:38] Kermamakkara: they have made lists on equipment they've lost
[0:58:42] steffan_cbs: @dankNbeans he stop
[0:58:44] MrCythe: the pd needs you @timmac,cop POV here we come
[0:58:48] Azzarill: they already got the gun ??
[0:58:53] R3dl1nes: ppl in chat was saying appeal the charges but i think MR k is dead set on killing cops

[0:59:02] valorbhill: K literally handed police equipment back to them previously when it was found in the river, the logic didn't really add up to me
[0:59:03] Steelhuf: @Timmac They are because when a gun gets taken, all their other equipment gets taken as well. So when a gun gets taken they raid for all the vests and tasers per Ruth and Slacks
[0:59:06] Meistar__: Classic
[0:59:07] BigglesVII: Did come accross as a fishing expedition rather than a justified search but a judge signed off on it.
[0:59:08] nick_dr1ft: @Timmac Ruth's entire scope was they found the gun on him after he was shot and gsr Negative, so she wanted to search for "other PD equipment"
[0:59:13] ExessiveGK: Slacks slipped and said they been trying to bust K for a while and could never find anything
[0:59:24] rjakarandom91: Gomer should be a legal aid for the case lol
[0:59:24] Twitter1333: and they served him with the worant as he was doing lawyer shit with dunde
[0:59:27] halos420: @r3dl1nes there is a chance he reels it in and tries to fight it legally first
[0:59:38] pigscanflyhigh: @R3dl1nes Precedent has been set though... Personally, I don't see any point to appeal
[0:59:44] vi_horrors: not to mention that this all came from an search that was really iffy, bc technically mrk was a victim and they took a report as fact
[0:59:46] R3dl1nes: @halos420 yup i hope he does frist to try and save it
[0:59:48] Lepaca: @nick_dr1ft Ruth wasn't involved, she only served the warrant
[0:59:55] Cypher_5: funny how when they found a cone, this is police equipment LUL
[0:59:58] dankNbeans: EXCELLENT QUESTION
[1:00:01] CrAzYMaYnE: Ya that was facked
[1:00:01] bobthegibbon: The search warrant wasnt ready
[1:00:02] Steelhuf: Ruth is pushing to have a auto raid if you get found with a PD gun
[1:00:04] reggang: they needed their witness
[1:00:05] jay2seam: that and no bench trial, warrant was given until after the raid
[1:00:06] ExessiveGK: @Twitter1333 they didn't server the raid warrant till after they went to release him
[1:00:06] Kermamakkara: because they had to wait for the raid to be approved
[1:00:07] vi_horrors: they released him bc they knew they fucked up with the search
[1:00:07] R3dl1nes: because of ruth and grey
[1:00:07] LuckyNZ: Cause they had absolutely no documentation or procedure for raids
[1:00:08] pigscanflyhigh: Had to get warrant
[1:00:10] gamma_smash: the cops didn't have the ability to search the stashes
[1:00:12] reggang: but the witness was probably the one who shot him
[1:00:12] 8R00KS: They wanted the other parties statements
[1:00:12] BigglesVII: Slacks was being a push over and let him out without a raid being done.
[1:00:13] gumpZ__: because he was cooking them about dundee
[1:00:14] GoAskAlice91: I feel like PD cared more about trying to get a win than actual RP
[1:00:15] ItsJoey_E: cause they stopped medical to search him
[1:00:18] 8R00KS: aka the other shooters to give them info
[1:00:18] bard_s: the mr k insindence was just bad from the start to the end. that judge should get fired it didn´t give any sense
[1:00:19] francewon_: bc he was being a nuisance in the cells and that was their chance to shut him up
[1:00:21] LuckyNZ: So they half wrote shit up, which still wasn't done when they did the raid
[1:00:27] LtMackAttack: multiple groups and people have been found with PD equipment. They can't generalize that to one person and justify that may or may not have the items.
[1:00:27] nick_dr1ft: @Lepaca she told K this in the car when they were going to do the search warrents with K
[1:00:28] valorbhill: the guy that is the witness has said if it goes to trial he won't testify either

[1:00:33] R3dl1nes: Grey wanted to raid mr k and ruth was the hammer to push it to judges
[1:00:35] yogibv2: he’ll win the appeal easily I think but he still wants to kill pd because of the way they went about it
[1:00:38] ExessiveGK: He was never given a warrant during the raid,
[1:00:39] KoD_SicKFreaK: now with serial #s on guns, they will be able to go back to that specific incident and see if anything was taken along with the gun.if not, no raid should happen
[1:00:41] gumpZ__: They raided X 5 minutes before K
[1:00:41] emrejonson: benji got arrested over 24 hours ago, he gonna get raided today because Ruth wants
[1:00:41] Azzarill: slacks never shown k the warrant ?
[1:00:43] nickikay: cause Mr.k was spitting fact they couldnt handle it so Ruth pushed it to shut him up
[1:00:48] fenr33r: they released him because they didn't have their story straight initially on if it was legal to search him in the first place
[1:00:49] xxMrGamerBG1xx: the first time they fucked up so they let him go but they were getting cooked by k now all of a sudden they go after him
[1:00:49] sym_biotic: @Lepaca thats not entirely true, ruth was the one who pushed for them to keep going after slacks said he didnt think there was enough.
[1:00:50] Cypher_5: they hated his guts
[1:00:54] ItsJoey_E: police fucked up and stopped end treating k and searched him
[1:00:56] dankNbeans: i think Gomer should talk to his lawyer lol
[1:00:56] halos420: @bigglesvii you sound like a dumb Redditor
[1:00:57] TigerHeli79: its planting season, plant guns on enemies will be the new meta
[1:01:01] Steelhuf: its because Slacks said to let people go and arrested later so they have time to gain evidence and get the report/warrant straight so people are not held up
[1:01:06] Rabidwizardeye: K gonna go on rampage be top tier entertainment
[1:01:09] nick_dr1ft: @Timmac K has not been shown a single warrent yet, just to be clear
[1:01:13] Kermamakkara: @nickikay they pushed the warrant as soon as they got the raid approved
[1:01:14] Jessimi: Apparently someone at the same time K was in PD was arrested for being too loud in the hospital LUL
[1:01:14] xl_scout_lx: @Timmac Serious quesion...to your current knowledge is Los Santos part of America and citizens have normal American rights?
[1:01:20] MistressGayle: gsr before cpr free k
[1:01:20] bigfoot7802: @Steelhuf as it should be
[1:01:25] BigglesVII: @halos420 Thanks for that, im an Rper.
[1:01:25] ggsz: @nickikay wrong, i was watching a cop pov and the warrant was signed when k was in the cells representing dundee
[1:01:26] iSTuBBZz: why didn't benji get raided when he was gaught with a gun
[1:01:28] Kioshigin: Was funny then the cops shot the tanker lol
[1:01:29] emrejonson: search warrant
[1:01:30] Twitter1333: @ExessiveGK not the arrest warrant was whill he was talking to donde
[1:01:31] redbeerdx: They showed his lawyer
[1:01:32] Lepaca: he has been given the warrant
[1:01:33] JordonPick: yes
[1:01:33] mystic_mic: sounds like tabcharge release pending investigation
[1:01:34] wibs14: They didnt provide him with the raid warrant
[1:01:35] ExessiveGK: yes and they said no when he was first arrested
[1:01:36] Azzarill: prob not lol
[1:01:36] altoidstin1: yes after they raid only
[1:01:37] BiGGHydro: Everyone thinks so
[1:01:37] bigfoot7802: K didn't want it at the end KEKW
[1:01:38] meli_travels: a search warrant is supposed to
[1:01:41] bluntguardian420: has there ever been a warrant not signed for a raid??
[1:01:41] Steelhuf: @bigfoot7802 I agree
[1:01:43] VHD7: toonyPopcorn mornin mr strimmah and chat, how goes the grind? Or are we decorating so far today
[1:01:43] Jasonam8: Judges are about to wake up in the hospital with pd glocks...
[1:01:44] BurpYeah: yeah slacks said he was sending K a copy
[1:01:47] kyanpeppaa: they showed the search warrant it to his lawyer but his lawyer couldn't go with them when they were doing the search, its kinda wild
[1:01:47] emrejonson: @iSTuBBZz he will today
[1:01:49] yogibv2: they tried to gave him one
[1:01:50] ItsJoey_E: waited till after the raid
[1:01:55] coffeeatm: @Timmac They can after the raid, is what slack said
[1:01:56] meli_travels: but slacks went to show it after the raid and K wasn’t having it refused it
[1:02:00] Jessimi: A LOT of laws and such are going to be fleshed out today LOL
[1:02:00] francewon_: he sent it after the raid lol
[1:02:01] WhoKnowz21: thats fked you can plant guns= easy raid yikes
[1:02:05] bigfoot7802: his lawyer saw it, but K didn't want to see it.
[1:02:12] iSTuBBZz: @emrejonson oh okay
[1:02:13] ExessiveGK: @Twitter1333 Yes I said that he was never shows a raid warrant lmao kebunSmoke kebunSmoke kebunSmoke kebunSmoke kebunSmoke
[1:02:15] InsanePebbles1980: Yes so bass gave it to him after the raid at prison
[1:02:25] xxMrGamerBG1xx: #guilty until proven innocent
[1:02:33] wibs14: These cops treat this like IRL unless it doesnt benefit them
[1:02:34] Sneaks: I think it is wild they didnt raid X or Murphy previously when they were found with PD guns. They obviously raided X before K but that was unrelated to his case with the PD gun
[1:02:35] omascas: @InsanePebbles1980 bass died 5 years ago
[1:02:37] saltdalt: The PD fucked up is the real issue and K and just getting super F-ed
[1:02:38] Jasonam8: Irl the cops give warrant at time of search
[1:02:41] francewon_: they have a whole redacted thing on the warrant they gave him thouhg
[1:02:42] MikeTorcido: He thinks they locked him in the station, so they could rush the arrest warrant
[1:02:43] ExessiveGK: they did 2 raids at once , K and X both at the same time
[1:02:46] LiquidSchwartzOG: Thery wouldn't even let the lawyer come on the raid.
[1:02:50] R3dl1nes: TBH can should beable to beat this if he appeals its just make sure u hire all the lawyers so the cops dont have any :D
[1:02:53] BurpYeah: K was twatting out some crazy shit last night lol
[1:02:59] francewon_: they redacted/sealed marys name and everything
[1:03:02] xl_scout_lx: @Timmac based on your current knowledge is Los Santos part of America and do citizens have normal American rights?
[1:03:03] yogibv2: ramee told slacks to clear his house due to the raid before the info was public
[1:03:05] VHD7: Big dill? toonyHmm a pickle w/ lunch does sound good
[1:03:05] halos420: Luckiest part was Mr k and ramee had radios so when ramee left mrpd K radioed he was being arrested for a warrant
[1:03:06] wibs14: X and K both going on a rampage
[1:03:08] InsanePebbles1980: I think they gave it to his lawyer but the lawyer said it didnt make sence
[1:03:12] dankNbeans: omg the Twatter war, i forgot about that lol
[1:03:14] xxMrGamerBG1xx: gomey is a cutie
[1:03:18] Kxart: they need to provide after with all objects confiscated?
[1:03:20] bard_s: e houses he had rented out to cops and others were also raided, that was a bit strange he had rental papers that it was rented out
[1:03:24] Jessimi: Today's RP should be crazy all around.
[1:03:25] jay2seam: the PD couldn't even figure out which house to raid LUL
[1:03:27] Nitrostealth: Yooooo timmac how's it going?
[1:03:36] saltdalt: slacks said there are no laws yet
[1:03:36] hippieh8rlol: Crane said there's no bill of rights in los santos
[1:03:36] MrCythe: K did a good job of not just giving up when they put him in prison. he actually stayed around and made content for like 3 hours in prison, instead of f8
[1:03:38] Kermamakkara: a lot of the laws arent in yet
[1:03:40] emrejonson: CG and Company should team up to get rid of RUTH, then split again
[1:03:41] luis2386: if he goes to court, can they lose because they didn’t show it before hand?
[1:03:43] giggles5502: When k gets on he is about to go crazy
[1:03:44] Lamb_Hawk: There was no investigation for the other involved party. That is what I think sucks personally. But who cares. makes for good RP
[1:03:47] zWizWu: Ramee was running thru grove screaming the british are coming
[1:03:48] ExessiveGK: there is no legislate in the city they are still making laws as they go so it would be a common wealth state
[1:03:49] xxMrGamerBG1xx: a nice brisket sounds good rn
[1:03:50] JordonPick: ez appeal
[1:03:53] InsanePebbles1980: They werent looking for a gun they were looking for other equipment
[1:03:53] BurpYeah: got to modify it for the gta world
[1:03:56] brude42: Like pledging to the Texas flag
[1:04:00] R3dl1nes: i think Mr K needs one of those 1to1 Gomer Talks  later on
[1:04:05] Jessimi: MrCythe Agreed. K managed to make content while alone in jail for 3 hours. Kudos to him.
[1:04:05] hippieh8rlol: yeah because everything cant be 1 to 1 with real law
[1:04:11] wibs14: k was so fed up that he doesnt even want to appeal
[1:04:11] WhoKnowz21: yep I though so too
[1:04:12] bard_s: so in other words officer Slack was acctually raided because of the mr k raid
[1:04:16] ExessiveGK: It's a distract
[1:04:18] beastly_kush: there is no constitution in the server they didnt want to use external stuff Timmac
[1:04:19] erquilene: how is the K-section progressing? ..- heard that they were thinking the IRL law about renting housing is a scam LUL
[1:04:22] drshagnastyy: Dab talked about putting those in to place at the next council meeting
[1:04:22] ExessiveGK: "disctrict"
[1:04:25] omascas: no pleading the 5th for example
[1:04:27] BurpYeah: true
[1:04:30] theonyxedition: Well K town exists now..
[1:04:51] osoi____: Mr k needs an AH-64 APACHE
[1:04:54] ExessiveGK: my spelling lol but you know what I mean
[1:04:57] itisacar: cant wait to see if Little Texas becomes a real thing
[1:05:12] kvnater: states do have their own bill of rights.
[1:05:14] LiquidSchwartzOG: Maybe people thinking of section 8.
[1:05:24] ExessiveGK: the way an RP city is it would be a district or Common wealth state
[1:05:26] USMCSapper: They need to provide the search warrant prior to the search. Like the moment the cops are ready to breach the door is when the search warrant should be provided

[1:05:31] ragenbeast1: Crain even said he dosent want irl case laws used in game and wants the case laws to come from in server
[1:05:40] BurpYeah: they just figured if K was involved it was a scam that was the vibe I was getting
[1:05:44] Twitter1333: @ExessiveGK i know but im on about the arrest warrant not the such warrant two different warrant was written that day for k one written by routh and the other by leo slaks
[1:05:58] bigfoot7802: @BurpYeah thats a weird take.
[1:06:11] brude42: So the council just didnt understand reits?
[1:06:14] xl_scout_lx: @Timmac since the 1st official council meeting the other day Los Santos is not in America and the only current "Constitution" are 5 Articles that were written. Currently, based on Los Santo's law, in 4.0, citizens have zero to no "rights".
[1:06:17] BurpYeah: @BurpYeah coming from K himself
[1:06:26] hippieh8rlol: K does have a good reason o be mad though. out of the 9 or so people on scene when he was shot only K and Ramee were detained lol
[1:06:28] sym_biotic: @bigfoot7802 I mean its not they actually said that in the council meeting
[1:06:31] dankNbeans: even Crane said, the term 'landlord' doesn't exist in the city
[1:06:37] Steelhuf: But the judge said it's not a real business. But it should be. Anyone can buy a house and rent it out
[1:06:37] giggles5502: The crazy thing is he was in the cells doing being a legal aid and that's when they put the warrant out for him
[1:06:41] MONSTERSbruh: Ngl as annoyed as I am with everything that happened with K, the guy I felt for the most yesterday was Murphy
[1:06:46] ExessiveGK: @Twitter1333 the search warrant was made the day before a judge came into the city to sign it yesterday
[1:06:56] wibs14: their reasoning was no law doesnt matter
[1:06:58] erquilene: yeah.. i wonder why they were thinking like that- when it is basically loan business - but with houses
[1:07:01] xl_scout_lx: There's no law to support the contract
[1:07:04] dankNbeans: consult your lawyer dude
[1:07:05] bigfoot7802: @bigfoot7802 did you watch that meeting?
[1:07:05] killogic916: @hippieh8rlol to be fair, there was 1 cop and a downed person. All of the other side drive away and the single cop cant chase.
[1:07:07] Rambler: the terms arent legally defined according to Crane
[1:07:09] bobthegibbon: The arguement is that the laws irl are too in-depth for them to cross over into NP
[1:07:12] brandon07199101: yeah I think it’s stupid to raid the rental property
[1:07:18] xl_scout_lx: Exactly
[1:07:23] havefunuall: 100%
[1:07:24] ExessiveGK: Crane said theres no law for whats in the contrct to "support rentals"
[1:07:25] wibs14: exactly.. they were saying that no one should own a business right now
[1:07:26] MrCythe: exactly, sell the cop rental. ez money
[1:07:27] RomeoEyes: All the rental contracts people signed.
[1:07:35] Azzarill: K can keep all the money and the houses no ???#
[1:07:39] sym_biotic: @bigfoot7802 ya the whole thing. they also said that someone like ramee shouldnt ever be mayor
[1:07:39] RomeoEyes: none matter since there is no law binding the contract
[1:07:41] OinkerNOR: Good morning. timmacWAVE
[1:07:42] StreamElements: timmacHI
[1:07:47] dankNbeans: that's why i'm saying, liquidate cop house immediately and go buy a Porsche
[1:07:48] omascas: true
[1:07:49] giggles5502: Murphy said to k I'm going to the airport and taking a flight out that he was done
[1:07:50] Steelhuf: They said the contract isn't valid a judge didn't sign off on it per the board
[1:07:52] mystic_mic: simple agreements lead to contracts
[1:07:58] suijay: so, would k be in trouble if he didn’t pay people back and sold all the properties?
[1:08:03] xl_scout_lx: Do to the court house and look at the 5 articles that are currently "running" Los Santos
[1:08:07] havefunuall: yeah sell the cop house K already kick slacks out and fine him with 30k
[1:08:09] standbyrogue: @dankNbeans this tbh DinoDance
[1:08:15] bigfoot7802: @bigfoot7802 Thanks
[1:08:17] erquilene: i just love how they actually called LAW a scam LUL
[1:08:26] dankNbeans: if you don't have a bright pink leopard print Pounder by end of day, i just might cry
[1:08:35] ExessiveGK: the funny thing is Crane says that now but was the one who looked at K  contract and said it looked good when it was written
[1:08:38] kyanpeppaa: I can't believe they shaved his beard Sadge
[1:08:40] MrCythe: damn a civ knows the laws better than the cops. imagine.
[1:08:58] onewipecharlie: crane was talking to max and said he didn't even know that stuff was happening and they should probably address it with laws, etc.
[1:08:59] Jaafil: i think council need to meet more than 1 time per week and establish all these laws
[1:09:06] Kermamakkara: but is renting a "service"
[1:09:13] Corrigax: i feel like they are gonna run with max's whole "dont say you own a business" thing
[1:09:20] omascas: that's why it's funny, if anything was found in one of the tenants houses, because San Andreas doesn't have legislation on contracts, K would be liable as the homeowner
[1:09:27] standbyrogue: This has happened before if you recall. At the start of 4.0, K was stabbed while working G6. Ruth didn't even want to collect a statement from him
[1:09:27] MONSTERSbruh: Covers the state owned businesses only. Weird
[1:09:29] giggles5502: K got fined 33k but he didn't even get a bench trial or nothing due to the Murphy trial which I think isn't fair
[1:09:33] xxMrGamerBG1xx: sheesh better pay for the blowe
[1:09:34] Steelhuf: @Timmac They want to push unauthorized Sale law
[1:09:37] Lamb_Hawk: yeah, housing
[1:09:43] noob3864: sell the houses pay 400$ fine ez
[1:09:47] bluntguardian420: 12 months and 300 bucks lol ok  ez for a 200k house
[1:09:47] smokebreezy: the cops just don't investigate
[1:09:48] bigfoot7802: @giggles5502 thats what appeals are for
[1:09:51] VHD7: in terms of right-now, id say thats enough backing since theres no official law/code
[1:09:54] francewon_: so if slacks backs out of the lease hes committing a misdemeanor   Kappa
[1:09:56] KoD_SicKFreaK: the council who was not appointed by the people, have more power then Dab
[1:10:08] BigglesVII: @omascas Yep, contracts would need to be produced at court and then the precedent would be set.
[1:10:10] ExessiveGK: they pulled the same moves with lawyers and no conflict in the state announcement but refuse certain people to be defended
[1:10:11] xl_scout_lx: @Timmac go back into the court house and read the 5 Articles that are the "current" Los Santo's "Constiution"
[1:10:13] erquilene: @bluntguardian420 that is on top of what is needed to pay
[1:10:14] killogic916: Sadam HuCrane
[1:10:15] VHD7: But i think it will get messy with the 'service' definition the first time it goes to court
[1:10:16] Kermamakkara: @giggles5502 he can bench trial it today if he wants to still
[1:10:19] giggles5502: I love that when they couldn't find ks property they wanted him to tell them and he said Ruth you do your job it was great
[1:10:23] mystic_mic: inverse logic
[1:10:30] mizledTV: One of the judges were saying something lasty night that anyone selling anything in the yellowpages could be fined kekw

[1:10:46] ShadowSithBane: The city council being able to shut down RP for any reason they want seems really dumb, those business were setup with straight RP and shutdown with none
[1:10:48] Lamb_Hawk: sell the PD house first and foremost LUL
[1:10:52] ragenbeast1: It depends on if the judge persuading over the case wants to follow the letter of the law or spirit of the law

[1:11:05] TheEternaIMan: To me the whole state acting like you can’t use the words “trusts” and the like is crazy just because they have defined trusts in the city lol
[1:11:05] dankNbeans: lots of things about yesterday didn't really make sense
[1:11:05] RomeoEyes: Yeah.
[1:11:13] reaves75stl: @ShadowSithBane say it louder for the people in teh back
[1:11:19] giggles5502: @kermamakkara yeah I know I hope he does and take that officer grey to court for telling EMS to stop working on him so she can search him
[1:11:20] mystic_mic: cherry picking
[1:11:21] ExessiveGK: they also said Lang can't have a Union because Unions can't sell items and make prophet
[1:11:23] standbyrogue: @giggles5502 What's even funnier, they forced RP for the vehicle search because they had that option. But when it doesn't work for them, it's "resisting"
[1:11:28] Lamb_Hawk: That's why K is upset
[1:11:30] doggersdoit: Top of law said "Involving theft" so that does not apply in this case
[1:11:31] djB_Luke: yup I think that’s what’s the most frustrating part of scenarios and “crime”
[1:11:32] omascas: @omascas depends on how the trial goes, but even if they showed someone else was living there, since the owner is K, the others would be associates and he would be the main culprit of what is found on his property
[1:11:39] djB_Luke: criminals*
[1:11:48] Steelhuf: They said they can push Unauthorized sales law on anyone on Yellow Pages if its not a state-owned business right now
[1:11:51] BurpYeah: council should be assisting avenues of rp not trying to sabotage it
[1:11:52] xl_scout_lx: @Timmac It's like yes you can write up a contract with someone, but there are no laws that would support that contract to be valid based on the current "Articles" that Los Santos is being run under
[1:11:52] redbeerdx: What lang is doing is nothing like a union lol
[1:11:55] GamerGoat007: Characters given these positions can make or break a sever imo
[1:11:58] 0beh: Love the car, just don't tie the dog leash to the bumper LUL
[1:11:59] dankNbeans: just keep in mind that 4.0 has been getting daily adjustments and changes since Day One, so what happened in the past may not apply today and tomorrow.  nobody knows.
[1:12:03] VHD7: @redbeerdx forreal sumLUL
[1:12:07] skruhhbish: Sounds like NP sucks nut atm LUL
[1:12:09] Azzarill: He is
[1:12:09] Kermamakkara: @ExessiveGK unions are non-profit organizations if he renamed it to something else he could
[1:12:17] coffeeatm: @Timmac Max told Lang to instead make it "guild" instead of Union
[1:12:24] francewon_: what are the higher odds today? k kills a cop or k wins an appeal
[1:12:25] MONSTERSbruh: It reeks of a whole lotta "I wasn't involved in it from the start, so you can't have it"
[1:12:29] ViewbotReportingforDuty: The Union issue is literally half settled by rebrand themselves as Guild. Literally what the mayor has told mostly everyone
[1:12:29] gamesbychaz: this makes things sound not promising for having a Wu Chang bank account
[1:12:41] ExessiveGK: @Kermamakkara I'm not debating that lol but it's not in the laws they can't
[1:12:42] bigfoot7802: @francewon_ why not both KEKW
[1:12:47] beastly_kush: Max literally said all that matters is the name its not that they are  stopping him
[1:12:52] Steelhuf: @Timmac whats the sub goal for hour 2 20 sub?
[1:12:52] standbyrogue: Both is good
[1:13:02] TheEternaIMan: I get them not wanting to adopt US law but they have to let basic stuff roll along in RP
[1:13:02] blockedgreed: It could just be named union. And not be a union
[1:13:06] francewon_: @bigfoot7802 truuuuuu kebunSip
[1:13:11] ExessiveGK: Lang refused to be called a guild it was so funny
[1:13:21] Lepaca: Onion NODDERS
[1:13:21] erquilene: whoc arews.. it is a gang in the end LUL
[1:13:22] NateBui: Even the name “Union” could mean something else

[1:13:45] bigfoot7802: true LUL
[1:13:48] Ecex93: dont worry owners got the union boxes ticked
[1:13:56] Lamb_Hawk: taxes but no laws, got it LUL

[1:14:03] standbyrogue: you've nailed it, "when it suits them"
[1:14:06] bigfoot7802: sounds like a town hall meeting is needed
[1:14:07] ExessiveGK: that was my point @Timac
[1:14:07] owenrogers10b: yeah, they’re saying they can’t pass a real estate trust because trust isn’t defined in law, neither is union🤷‍♂️
[1:14:10] Lepaca: Los Santos Sanitation Onion, there I fixed it LUL
[1:14:16] BurpYeah: sanitation mebers coalition
[1:14:16] spartacus1j: @spartacus1j but cops are still goina get hit today
[1:14:17] ShadowSithBane: Doesn't the city council negate the point of electing a mayor?
[1:14:17] fenr33r: sounds like they dont want anyone to have any creative and personal businesses
[1:14:17] omascas: there's no union laws but there are gang laws
[1:14:23] New_York_E: they did k wrong yesterday
[1:14:28] suijay: @spartacus1j I dunno dude. after last night I might not want her as my lawyer Kappa
[1:14:28] RomeoEyes: How long did it take to have the problem with the word "Union"?
[1:14:30] New_York_E: the whole way it went down
[1:14:34] johnnytwotimed: @Lepaca Theres layers to this shit
[1:14:38] AnomaL3E: back to prodigy?
[1:14:39] paiger1430: I hope he gives his civ rp one more try and appeals and sues pd
[1:14:42] Ismellkevinbacn: Murphy actually left the city last night for food after they court hearing he said he was done
[1:14:47] benbeanz420: k block
[1:14:51] Ismellkevinbacn: For good
[1:14:52] Lepaca: @johnnytwotimed OMG perfection
[1:14:55] bg_z: sometimes I think people forget this is a freaking game
[1:15:05] Azzarill: yep
[1:15:05] francewon_: also crane told ramee theres no conflict of interest one day and then another judge the next day said it was so they dont even have it straight
[1:15:06] reaves75stl: yep
[1:15:07] killogic916: yeah
[1:15:07] ExessiveGK: which is the bad side of having a committee board
[1:15:08] bluntguardian420: @New_York_E wouldnt be the frist time they have done that
[1:15:09] jay1988HD: ya
[1:15:11] standbyrogue: they need "internal affairs"  job or however it's called in the states
[1:15:14] xl_scout_lx: @Timmac Tuggz went to traffic court the other day and was told by a judge that he has no 1st amendment rights and was told he does not live in America
[1:15:14] TigerHeli79: yes then left via airport
[1:15:15] owenrogers10b: ohh yeah, the judgement was insane
[1:15:16] MrCythe: the judge was dumb AF
[1:15:16] LiquidSchwartzOG: Yup. Time to plant PD weapons on every judge.
[1:15:17] forfiet: he’s very sad about it and “leaving to the airport” @timmac
[1:15:19] ShadowSithBane: So you can just plant guns on all judges now right?
[1:15:19] Twitter1333: yep then he took a flight
[1:15:20] Morfius53_: Oh yeah. Murphy said he's taking a plane outta town

[1:15:39] b_goodhue: Planet then make 911 call
[1:15:41] New_York_E: yeah but they were supposed to clean this all up looks like same 3.0
[1:15:45] smokebreezy: order 66
[1:15:48] omascas: it's funny because these failures of the justice system exist in real life
[1:15:50] TheEternaIMan: Yeah you guys should just plant on every judge and use the precedent they want so badly against them lol
[1:15:50] MONSTERSbruh: Ramee sounded more furious about the Murphy thing than the K situation
[1:15:51] BurpYeah: yeah he said he was leaving for Guatamala lol
[1:15:53] redbeerdx: Yeah, just gotta swap the PD guns for some weed during the holdups now lol
[1:15:54] ShadowSithBane: @New_York_E looks worse tbh
[1:15:55] WhoKnowz21: what's stopping it from happing to other judges.
[1:15:58] Lepaca: "It's not my gun officer, I got Murphy'd"
[1:15:58] Azzarill: K got 30k fine all invested cash ?
[1:15:59] Bali_d: gun on judges, weed on cops LUL
[1:16:13] ggsz: @killogic916 ruth said judges will get some 'slack' now bcoz people will plant shit now

[1:16:14] TigerHeli79: and cops can't find house addresses LUL

[1:16:16] bg_z: with NO questions asked
[1:16:21] dankNbeans: GONNA BE A SPICY DAY
[1:16:23] Jaafil: every judge
[1:16:23] iSTuBBZz: dna now though
[1:16:23] Nitrostealth: Not anymore though because of DNA now
[1:16:26] redbeerdx: Yeah, even Saab was saying hes going to be getting a gun put on him lol
[1:16:27] brentvargas: ruth was already saying now theyre going to use officer discretion when it comes to judges and pd and such
[1:16:27] pigscanflyhigh: If you plant a gun you have your DNA on it no?
[1:16:28] halos420: i dont know how it will work now that they have thjis DNA mechanic though
[1:16:34] Corrigax: K's appeal could go different without the gsr but still, just make em shoot the gun before plant
[1:16:34] coffeeatm: @Timmac Ramee said he was gone Appeal it with Crane, and Murphy wasnt in the airport, and was gone wait out things
[1:16:35] b_goodhue: Especially gun then they gonna raid ya
[1:16:37] ShadowSithBane: @ggsz that isn't how law works, there is a precedent now
[1:16:39] MONSTERSbruh: Man, and I thought the snitches on Prodigy were bad LUL
[1:16:40] redmistintheair: k showed up to pick his stuff up from cornwood after jail and k had a pd glock and like 7 mags shit was so funny
[1:16:40] meli_travels: k should start planting on every cop and judge until they have to realize
[1:16:45] paiger1430: the set themselves up for horrible precedent
[1:16:54] livenotonevil_: all you have to do is get someone that's not in the system to plant it
[1:16:54] ragenbeast1: And since it was a actual court case then it sets the precedent
[1:16:57] Azzarill: you only have to have the gun on you?
[1:17:00] emrejonson: there must be a counter for DNA right? otherwise its too OP
[1:17:00] Nitrostealth: Yes from inventory to inventory
[1:17:04] Rambler: the dna mechanic isnt very effective atm, only certain actions leaves it
[1:17:05] bluntguardian420: DNA on everything
[1:17:08] beastly_kush: no if you drop it
[1:17:09] Steelhuf: They can swab anything. They need to get your DNA on file first
[1:17:12] ggsz: @ShadowSithBane i understand that, but unfortunately they decide what happens in the end
[1:17:15] H3adass_: Ez plant weed and shoot them down then say the local did it
[1:17:15] RomeoEyes: Oh geez.
[1:17:17] iSTuBBZz: i was talking the gun
[1:17:17] standbyrogue: oh here we go
[1:17:20] suijay: uh LOL
[1:17:21] blockedgreed: Pretty sure ramee had dna on weed when someone handed it to him
[1:17:23] robert__tokking: They made possession 10/10s of the law
[1:17:25] BigMac8835: kill her

[1:18:07] toxictimewaster: I think that Murphy lost because if he would have won then they could reference his case for k and get him odd and they didn't want to do that
[1:18:10] ggsz: @ShadowSithBane if it happens to a judge they wont charge them. so they do have a say...
[1:18:20] b_goodhue: There's green behind u

[1:19:23] Nagini_Rowle_: You can kidnap a cop sign them off duty. Kidnap a judge like crane have them rob the cop for the gun. Pop a few shots off stab the judge ocean dump the cop. @timmac
[1:19:24] francewon_: oh this is the one who pushed and said some weird stuff to k yesterday
[1:19:37] R3dl1nes: @halos420 Yup thats Grey

[1:25:42] coldbleb: they didnt vote for the legislation tho
[1:25:49] killogic916: @awwDrats it just makes a bit less $$
[1:25:52] coldbleb: its still up this saturday
[1:25:52] BurpYeah: did you upgrade the engine actually seems faster than stock
[1:26:02] standbyrogue: all business would be the same with no legislation surely?
[1:26:03] reaves75stl: -30k
[1:26:11] Kermamakkara: its not dead the council just needs to get through the laws and meetings
[1:26:12] meli_travels: l was frustrated last night. he said a lot of things. we gotta see what he says today after he’s slept on it
[1:26:14] VirtualVoyager: well when K does crimme all hoses get raided by the cops
[1:26:14] BurpYeah: it's not too bad then
[1:26:15] timedoggg: k took a 30k hit yesterday so idk if he able to pay out
[1:26:16] reaves75stl: hahaaha
[1:26:23] killogic916: and even with Tax it isnt a lot less $$ because you make the buyer pay for the taxes on Rent to Own
[1:26:31] meli_travels: no I I meant Mr. k lol
[1:26:31] b_goodhue: K already lost investors cash yesterday
[1:26:34] mrbiggies: She might not have a truck right now
[1:26:36] livenotonevil_: peepoRiot peepoRiot
[1:26:38] DESHAWNTE: @coldbleb They want K at the next meeting
[1:26:38] RestlessCount: they can raid any house and hold him responsible atm is what they said
[1:26:43] Lamb_Hawk: did Murphy quit NP last night?
[1:26:46] BurpYeah: save it for K lol
[1:26:46] R3dl1nes: hehe
[1:26:47] Corrigax: the cool down act
[1:26:49] 1DUALLY: lol
[1:26:50] saltdalt: lol
[1:26:51] nck_at_nite: dont kill her please lol
[1:26:51] NayNayGG: everyone slept on it and woke up heated today LUL
[1:26:52] Jessimi: There will be new fired up chatters joining later though LUL
[1:26:53] WhoKnowz21: lol
[1:26:54] reaves75stl: execute order 66
[1:26:54] Civrock: BabyRage
[1:26:55] macabrius: Its RP but he was definly pissed
[1:26:55] emrejonson: other issue is that they raided rentals too. If a tennant wanted to do illegal stuff, K would get them arrested unintentionally right?
[1:26:56] TigerHeli79: destroy her LUL
[1:26:58] standbyrogue: we need that "good stuff"
[1:26:58] killogic916: because K said kill Ruth 640 times last night
[1:26:59] Bageezus08: lol
[1:27:00] Tera: tbf K was saying to kill all cops for about 6hrs yesterday LUL
[1:27:00] j13butta: head hunters
[1:27:02] manny_281: K's gonna do that shit just wait and see
[1:27:02] livenotonevil_: moon2H pocket wipe and ocean dump her
[1:27:03] coldbleb: peepoRiot  Blood for the blood god peepoRiot
[1:27:03] Zewelly: chat should watch tuggz
[1:27:04] Twitter1333: demon time lmao
[1:27:04] halos420: i think K comes into today more relaxed and attampts to keep the real esttate business alive
[1:27:05] Ord1125: People still fired up for sure from last night lol
[1:27:08] MysteriousDreams: Free mk
[1:27:08] paiger1430: thats what I am hoping is like everyones calmed down and they appeal then win then go crazy
[1:27:10] GarlicMikeHawk: LUL
[1:27:12] habido69: I just wanted you to plant something on her lol
[1:27:13] Ismellkevinbacn: Open season
[1:27:13] timedoggg: sick big d on her
[1:27:13] bluntguardian420: yes
[1:27:15] buckwild6: Council struck down the rental stuff didn't th3y
[1:27:15] BurpYeah: burn it down burn it down
[1:27:17] RaptorQuiz: Go to her house and take all the batteries out of all the remotes!!!!
[1:27:19] reaves75stl: so glad today is my firday
[1:27:21] reaves75stl: friday
[1:27:22] getrektlosernerd: @MysteriousDreams he is free
[1:27:23] coffeeatm: @Timmac The Yellow hair wasnt, the other one talking to you was, prob why chat going for blood
[1:27:25] Zewelly: we want reaper ults
[1:27:26] Steelhuf: I thinks its because K said no more nice guy he gets stopped hes killing lol
[1:27:30] R3dl1nes: tbh @Timmac end of the day when gomer finds out and that etc... i hope the gomer charm can convice mr k to fight it in court instead on the streets
[1:27:31] j0nnyfiver: the issue is that K thinks the REIT tax exemption is for the buying of the house, but the REIT tax exemption is for the investments and payouts not to be taxed and they already aren’t taxed, which is what Dab told K but I don’t think he understood
[1:27:31] WIHEEILS25: I am looking forward to how this plays out cause this is better than a lot of tv shows
[1:27:32] j13butta: poo on her pillow
[1:27:39] killogic916: @buckwild6 for now, but there was a lot of unknowns so it was defered to later
[1:27:46] MONSTERSbruh: I think Crane might still be open to hearing a proposal from K as well. He seemed hella confused by all the led up to K's imprisonment
[1:27:47] Rilix: i like to watch these streams like different POV's of a netflix show tbh
[1:27:48] coldbleb: PepeLaugh shoulda heard slacks yesterday
[1:27:51] nck_at_nite: i was more sad than fired up last night. just hoping it doesnt ruin the good RP we've had thus far by pushing people to extremes
[1:27:51] BurpYeah: slacks
[1:27:54] SteveAdeptus: What's funny is that all the crims hate Ruth and most of the police, also hate Ruth lol
[1:27:55] LarBearTV: @RaptorQuiz okay thats just too far PepeLaugh
[1:28:01] DESHAWNTE: @buckwild6 no they want K at the next meeting ❤️
[1:28:01] DTNTBOMB: @Timmac only you can save all this lol save Mr K your his only hope
[1:28:09] Sonicfear: Seriously, folks are far more invested in the arcs and the characters far earlier in 4.0, than any other NP season.
[1:28:11] Crazybro: Cornwoods hates Ruth LUL
[1:28:12] Zewelly: reaper ult that cop
[1:28:13] Lepaca: my strimmer got arrested = cop server Madge
[1:28:14] buckwild6: But the rental agreements are not accepted by the courts
[1:28:16] Tera: @RaptorQuiz sprinkle legos all over the floor!
[1:28:23] Steelhuf: @Timmac can K own a business now because of the charges?
[1:28:29] bibidi00: Vinny has to pay the fine for k so the money will be back for the real estate
[1:28:34] emrejonson: other issue is that they raided rentals too. If a tennant wanted to do illegal stuff, K would get them arrested unintentionally right?
[1:28:35] coldbleb: They think its slumdog rp thats why Sadge
[1:28:39] macabrius: @Steelhuf i donty think he can
[1:28:44] awwDrats: It sounded like contracts don't matt
[1:28:45] livenotonevil_: mayor approves all businesses and dab will always give K one
[1:28:46] killogic916: @emrejonson yes
[1:28:49] halos420: even K has stated the reit thing is a non issue if it doesnt get passed
[1:28:57] bigfoot7802: @livenotonevil_ not true.
[1:28:58] BurpYeah: they weren't ready for something that in depth
[1:29:01] JUNBUG_GAMING88: k said he getting treated like he was in 3.0
[1:29:02] Lamb_Hawk: I just think that viewers are a little frustrated when laws mean nothing and RP is constantly limited by either financial or police suppression
[1:29:04] buckwild6: Cops did not care about the fact that there was agreements, even though they said they would earlier
[1:29:08] VirtualVoyager: police raiding houses that have rent contracts  is a big council issue
[1:29:12] livenotonevil_: @bigfoot7802 it is
[1:29:19] halos420: well there is ways around that..
[1:29:24] bigfoot7802: @bigfoot7802 the council votes
[1:29:25] RegulatorTTV: K is cracked he is about to go full psycho mode
[1:29:25] getrektlosernerd: @Steelhuf yea he can just get someone like ursal to hold it down like 3.0
[1:29:26] j0nnyfiver: he needs you to own the houses which hopefully you boys discuss
[1:29:26] b_goodhue: He lost the cash with the fines
[1:29:41] smokebreezy: it would have saved evrything
[1:29:47] Steelhuf: he needs tessa to front the business
[1:29:48] SteveAdeptus: Mr. K meltdown arc
[1:29:49] halos420: how much cash can you keep in a stack? does cash weight alot or just dirty money?
[1:29:51] RegulatorTTV: felt like they didnt like rp yesterday
[1:29:51] coldbleb: NOPERS
[1:29:57] BurpYeah: lol
[1:29:59] reaves75stl: tell em
[1:29:59] steffan_cbs: timmacE timmacE timmacE
[1:29:59] Jessimi: Shotz wanted to be the clean guy this arc
[1:30:02] buckwild6: R7uth didn't.  She shut her trap yesterday and would not engage
[1:30:03] ItsAllDestiny: vinny wants to be clean
[1:30:05] halos420: MR K wouldnt put that on you
[1:30:07] BurpYeah: yeah make vinny do it
[1:30:08] DESHAWNTE: True
[1:30:12] TH4TFADE: vinny aint clean either when hes running his car dealership
[1:30:13] Raiderx_: @Jessimi  wasnt he the clean guy last time ?
[1:30:15] killogic916: More like cops like RP a bit too much and sometimes its kinda harsh on the crims.  Crims make less $$ than a civ but have HUGE fines.
[1:30:15] Steelhuf: @Timmac Tessa lol
[1:30:16] b_goodhue: Give it Richard lol
[1:30:20] valorbhill: Needs to be Siobhan
[1:30:20] bigfoot7802: just make Richard the owner KAppa
[1:30:20] TigerHeli79: the guy always cleaning out the house instead of doing the fun stuff
[1:30:23] orange51611: richard can handle it
[1:30:24] Descrete1: to CG, clean doesn't mean "clean"
[1:30:27] black_sloth: we are in this situation because of Vinny ... dont forget
[1:30:28] timedoggg: as soon as a bank opens everyone going to be a crim
[1:30:29] TH4TFADE: same with ramee he wants to be a lawyer

[1:30:38] Kermamakkara: @RegulatorTTV K was also really slamming them hard so its understandable they had hard time not malding aswell
[1:30:43] valorbhill: @TH4TFADE he doesn't, that was his last case
[1:30:44] VirtualVoyager: vinny wants to be the clean guy to have the money in his account so he  can get rdy to F around and do crime
[1:30:44] BigglesVII: Vinny has Ellie as a backup incase he gets caught
[1:30:46] Zewelly: or tessa
[1:30:47] woodywiththehoodie: @black_sloth weirdge
[1:30:49] b_goodhue: He didn't stab Mary Chris did that

[1:30:54] steffan_cbs: yess
[1:30:57] Zewelly: tessa is innocent as hell
[1:30:57] dankNbeans: she's on honeymoon
[1:31:01] francewon_: idk if k fully trusts her enough
[1:31:02] Steelhuf: No she said shes done with law
[1:31:04] coldbleb: or ursula if shes down
[1:31:14] appleceee: she wants out of this tho
[1:31:17] dr_rick16: Add her as CFO
[1:31:18] Zewelly: get mary to do it
[1:31:19] buckwild6: Use Carmen or Paris

[1:31:23] steffan_cbs: ramee to
[1:31:23] Tera: Gomer for clean guy Kappa
[1:31:26] emrejonson: yeah she asked for 5% of Section K if the law passed
[1:31:27] halos420: i mean after murphy got SHAFTED i can imagine alot of hope was lost
[1:31:27] kuhwit: alot of people are over it because of the murphy case lol
[1:31:27] b_goodhue: After the trail lastnight
[1:31:28] vi_horrors: yeah she threw her bar license lol
[1:31:28] black_sloth: @woodywiththehoodie vinny wanted k to get marry because he dont want to lose his biz
[1:31:31] Jessimi: Murphy told K yesterday he's leaving the server. I'll miss him.
[1:31:34] paiger1430: thats a problem too if your losing lawyers to dumb arrests and laws LOL
[1:31:34] MissinMyTeeth: gotta have a sit down with k today and talk to him about things.
[1:31:38] RegulatorTTV: no fair rules to follow or protect you so how can you be clean
[1:31:41] chvz__: do you think ott staying clean?
[1:31:41] Sonicfear: Carmella and money? Hahahahaha
[1:31:46] dankNbeans: Carmella just wants to marry rich, let's face it
[1:31:50] buckwild6: Tessa would be aweaome
[1:31:53] BurpYeah: tessa but I don't think she would want to
[1:31:54] smokebreezy: it would half to be a bussiness account
[1:31:55] ShrimpOnTheBarbii: Carmella killing clowns lol
[1:31:56] 0beh: Murphy has a lot of spare time on his hands
[1:31:57] livenotonevil_: tessa would prob do it
[1:31:58] Kixet: @Timmac Tessa did weed runs with K the other day. she said she dont wanna be cop
[1:31:58] giggles5502: Ursula loves doing that type of stuff
[1:31:58] MONSTERSbruh: Paris thinks investor money = Sugar Daddy Money.
[1:32:03] b_goodhue: Even the ppl going against Murphy thought he should had won
[1:32:05] Steelhuf: Only one would be Tessa she does Konnect and she wanted to do the real estate
[1:32:05] moiborg: make a character that never wakes up and give it to them LUL
[1:32:07] halos420: @Jessimi murphy is leaving, not voiceID the streamer
[1:32:11] black_sloth: EL TESSO
[1:32:12] robert__tokking: i vote for peanut butter
[1:32:13] ghostman16: Carmella would spend the money
[1:32:16] MissinMyTeeth: Ursula was all 3.0 CEO for K
[1:32:16] steffan_cbs: he leave
[1:32:17] buckwild6: Just use Max
[1:32:17] skruhhbish: Murphy leaving the server lol
[1:32:20] bigfoot7802: @BurpYeah she doesn't really need to do anything, juts be the name its under
[1:32:24] vi_horrors: no one with felonies can own a business anyways
[1:32:26] Rilix: murphys character left the city i believe
[1:32:28] RegulatorTTV: Murphy left server supposidly
[1:32:29] b_goodhue: K can still appeal it
[1:32:30] iSTuBBZz: poor murphy said he was going to the airport
[1:32:32] BigglesVII: Lol Richard
[1:32:40] livenotonevil_: siobhan would do it i bet
[1:32:41] halos420: chat is hella braindead right now, acting like these people are trustworthy to keep 100k in their account and not touch it
[1:32:45] zWizWu: Siobhan threw her Bar license at the court case yesterday lol
[1:32:49] giggles5502: Murphy said he is done and was going to the airport to take us one way flight out so
[1:32:49] xl_scout_lx: https://clips.twitch.tv/SassyToughArugulaJebaited-Jw0IFHE5vkjLjwjr
[1:32:51] Lamb_Hawk: in K's case at least he should be innocent until proven guilty
[1:32:51] moiborg: also doesn't matter who you pick if someone decides to plant a gun on them or weed LMAO
[1:32:53] buckwild6: Solomon
[1:32:58] VirtualVoyager: why not have a  backup char just to do the clean stuff?
[1:33:00] j0nnyfiver: did you see the clip of Cornwood checking K’s pocket at Mission Row after he got out and he already had a gun on him? lol. From Esfand’s pov is absolute gold
[1:33:02] buckwild6: Strike that
[1:33:05] SteveAdeptus: Mayor is conflict of interest
[1:33:08] Steelhuf: @b_goodhue he can but because Murphy case he most likely will be found guilty
[1:33:12] Crazybro: @VirtualVoyager pretty sure that's banworthy
[1:33:12] dankNbeans: GPS trackers on guns, i'm making my prediction now.
[1:33:13] livenotonevil_: he was
[1:33:14] Jessimi: j0nnyfiver He did lol
[1:33:14] Zewelly: yes
[1:33:14] getrektlosernerd: @livenotonevil_ i think someone said she done with the law not 100% sure
[1:33:14] saltdalt: yes
[1:33:14] timedoggg: yes
[1:33:15] halos420: yes
[1:33:15] theonyxedition: ye
[1:33:15] bobthegibbon: no
[1:33:15] ggsz: yes
[1:33:15] coldbleb: yea
[1:33:16] steffan_cbs: yes
[1:33:16] DTNTBOMB: yes
[1:33:16] ItsAllDestiny: ya
[1:33:17] paiger1430: yes
[1:33:17] LarBearTV: yeah
[1:33:17] Corrigax: yes
[1:33:18] ItsJoey_E: yes
[1:33:18] nickikay: yes
[1:33:19] Jaafil: yes
[1:33:19] giggles5502: Yes
[1:33:19] Azzarill: ye
[1:33:21] thepromonkey1: he was.
[1:33:23] xtylaw: yes
[1:33:28] halos420: jean paul made him shoot the gun
[1:33:28] Jessimi: And he got time served LUL
[1:33:31] moiborg: yep but it's based on possession not gsr positive
[1:33:32] DESHAWNTE: @dankNbeans Lol
[1:33:36] DESHAWNTE: yes
[1:33:38] standbyrogue: the police have said "gsr" doesn't matter however
[1:33:41] WhoKnowz21: they made him shot
[1:33:43] dankNbeans: he also claimed memory loss
[1:33:43] bigfoot7802: true, and the defense made no point as to why he may have been positive
[1:33:44] nck_at_nite: do we know if you can get GSR by proximity?
[1:33:45] livenotonevil_: poor murphy lol
[1:33:47] DTNTBOMB: @Timmac they was saying it was planted
[1:33:48] coffeeatm: @Timmac Tessa prob the best option if she wanna do it, cause everyone loves Tessa Lamb :D
[1:33:49] Zewelly: i think murphy is leaving for diff reasons tho
[1:33:54] b_goodhue: Someone could make him shoot it then kill him and plant it
[1:33:58] Crazybro: yes
[1:33:59] bg_z: murphy going into ICU and not really remembering also got him
[1:34:00] TH4TFADE: you think k has a chance at getting this case dropped?
[1:34:01] robert__tokking: It’s not right that they raid K for a gun  and not everyone else found with a PD Glock
[1:34:02] xtylaw: but the police knew it was the same set up as what happened to X and how he was charged
[1:34:02] getrektlosernerd: @dankNbeans that wont work lol
[1:34:19] Steelhuf: Day one!!
[1:34:19] coldbleb: Hmm if they had raided murphy would that mean they raid all of K's houses too? Since he was a renter
[1:34:22] dankNbeans: @shh_your_momloveit place your bet then
[1:34:24] SturdyDoor: that trial set a terrible precedent
[1:34:27] halos420: the judge basically told ramee they didnt provide enough of a narrative of how it all happened. and murphy basicaly couldnt remember because he got shot in the head
[1:34:29] giggles5502: I hope k takes it to court cuz the whole thing was a mess and the cops didn't do nothing right
[1:34:37] ShadowSithBane: @TH4TFADE not dropped, but I feel like he would win in court
[1:34:39] Sonicfear: You'd have to have a first hand witness to pull off that affirmative defense.
[1:34:39] BasedPennsylvania: gun plant szn boutta pop off
[1:34:45] bigfoot7802: @robert__tokking they raid anyone that is found with one
[1:34:46] MONSTERSbruh: Mr K is being silenced by THE WOKE MOB LUL
[1:34:51] francewon_: @coldbleb no they dont know who the renters are
[1:34:56] VirtualVoyager: @Crazybro why? it´s a multichar server, just needs to have some RP and the one with the clean char will never "know" the crim char.
[1:34:58] paiger1430: k was violated so many times during his case it would actually be crazy if he appealed
[1:35:01] Morfius53_: @coldbleb They did raid K. Did it yesterday.
[1:35:03] Azzarill: X planted it to make a point
[1:35:06] loooooney: Are you going to put more videos on tiktok?
[1:35:07] StreamElements: https://tiktok.com/@nottimmac
[1:35:17] blockedgreed: How'd they deal with planted in 3.0
[1:35:17] Lepaca: "I got Murphy'd, officer" LUL
[1:35:20] standbyrogue: I can't wrap my head around the search/ "frisk" of K when he was the one who got shot. Even with reasonable suspicion, it makes no sense as he was the victim
[1:35:20] coldbleb: @francewon_ oh so they would only see his apratment?
[1:35:30] xtylaw: @coldbleb no because murphy does not own the house  so they dont know like they no slacks rents the house they raided but its K house
[1:35:30] dankNbeans: @MONSTERSbruh that reminds me, i thought Ramee was gonna stab Ramaswamay after court LOL
[1:35:39] lawlzganked: i feel bad dude just wanted to be a judge now his game is kinda boned
[1:35:40] bigfoot7802: @standbyrogue there was a 911 saying he had a gun
[1:35:47] DocRavage: they have DNA now so it might get better.
[1:35:51] giggles5502: When k got raided there was so many people there supporting k while k yell kill Ruth
[1:35:52] TechToniic: Do you think burden of proof shifts to K because he had possession?
[1:35:59] MONSTERSbruh: There were chatters like "Yay X won". No he didn't.
[1:36:01] livenotonevil_: he shot an actual local
[1:36:05] TH4TFADE: @docravage theyve had it
[1:36:06] b_goodhue: Do those casings match up with that gun
[1:36:08] BurpYeah: murphy is a great judge too
[1:36:11] coldbleb: Hmm so rent a house from someone and stash your shit there from, youll never find shit
[1:36:12] ExessiveGK: The whole thing was Murphy's character though is that Murphy got a gun and was based on the fact there was no law and he could get away with it
[1:36:18] standbyrogue: @bigfoot7802 which to K's benefit, makes it all the more seem like a plant
[1:36:18] halos420: K has a pretty solid case and story
[1:36:20] steffan_cbs: you need be lawyer
[1:36:25] DocRavage: @TH4TFADE not for murphys case
[1:36:27] bigfoot7802: @bigfoot7802 exactly
[1:36:28] RegulatorTTV: Its wild if they found illegal stuff in the rentals K would have been charged for it. hahah so shortsided the way the pd thinks and operates.
[1:36:29] Steelhuf: Steelhuf subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! Day one!!
[1:36:29] R3dl1nes: mr k was well looing hes nut at the end :D 51/50  nuts
[1:36:29] StreamElements: timmacHYPE timmacH Welcome back, Steelhuf! timmacHI
[1:36:30] paiger1430: so do you think he could win the appeal?
[1:36:30] DonNiko99: You should become a lawyer alt!
[1:36:37] YxtBomb: murphys case saying "Positive GSR" i think is super key in K's case
[1:36:41] Lamb_Hawk: but they didn't investigate the other party and did not allow him to gather proof because he was arrested
[1:36:41] halos420: @standbyrogue yeah like how could that person know so certain that he had a gun
[1:36:45] appleceee: if they can DNA anything wouldnt they need to give crims measures to get their DNA off of items? @Timmac
[1:36:49] TechToniic: Yeah, that's gonna be where it gets interesting.
[1:36:52] standbyrogue: exactly
[1:36:57] Jessimi: paiger1430 I think he'd be found guilty of possession, but I think the way he was handled yesterday would get him a lot of his money back.
[1:36:58] explicitsmith: K can probably get his dropped but pretty sure he's still going after Ruth
[1:36:59] bigfoot7802: the lawyer K had yesterday was boring, but seemed to know his shit
[1:37:03] YxtBomb: It's not in the reports tho
[1:37:04] Lamb_Hawk: mind you, all while he was the victim
[1:37:05] dankNbeans: yeah, 'guilty until proven innocent' was said a lot last night all over the city
[1:37:06] Zewelly: ruth is friends with mary tho
[1:37:07] smokebreezy: just need to sue tf out of them
[1:37:10] b_goodhue: Plus someone already tried to plant weed on his property b4 too
[1:37:10] YxtBomb: The cop straight up lied
[1:37:11] Hey_its_Mady: If Ramee can do Lawyer stuff LUL you can easily do it let's be honest Kappa LUL
[1:37:14] ShadowSithBane: They didn't put that in the report and that cop is claiming it didn't happen
[1:37:15] Steelhuf: https://clips.twitch.tv/IgnorantAgitatedEggnogStinkyCheese-6zIUdo89D-6c0LQq
[1:37:15] steffan_cbs: @explicitsmith ye ye
[1:37:18] Sneaks: But Slacks said everyone on scene has to be assumed a suspect but the witness on scene saying K had a gun wasn't treated the same as K and Ramee
[1:37:19] reaves75stl: bets on orc music being played today?!??
[1:37:19] TechToniic: Yeah, maybe cast enough doubt with the way they processed the scene
[1:37:22] brolythechamp: Mr k waw gsr negitive and still got billed ane was on hold, but the apeel for k is more straight
[1:37:23] ExessiveGK: It even stated in the warrants with K that the warrant was based off of a reportedly called in 911 that somebody had a gun
[1:37:24] beastly_kush: @YxtBomb yup
[1:37:25] timedoggg: 911 call is best full proof evidence
[1:37:25] nick_dr1ft: @Timmac PD told K that if they found PD guns in the Slacks rental he would be liable LUL
[1:37:26] pustilence: the issue is that it appears super biased
[1:37:34] drunkcandyxx: yea they didnt really do their job there you reckon??
[1:37:38] VirtualVoyager: Ruth  might have also put this extra presure oon K ebcause of the way K  pushes and tries  to manipulate the police
[1:37:44] giggles5502: I can't wait for k to get on he is gonna turn the city upside down
[1:37:50] YxtBomb: facts
[1:37:52] ellystacklebox: Cop said. I've got a big bulge here, I'm checking it out
[1:37:58] TigerHeli79: the cops saw Ramee and K and just assumed they were the criminals
[1:38:01] DonNiko99: But shouldnt there be some form of DNA on it to prove if K has held it in his hands or someone else has?
[1:38:02] Lamb_Hawk: no investigation. that's the problem...
[1:38:08] Zewelly: @VirtualVoyager maybe in 3.0, mr k is super clean in 4
[1:38:09] YxtBomb: @shamelesssam while he was bleeding out and in EMS care mind you
[1:38:10] BasedPennsylvania: why does a city with no civilian guns need a pd with guns.
[1:38:12] Sonicfear: Enough to cause reasonable doubt
[1:38:13] standbyrogue: @explicitsmith he needs to tbh, as much as last night was good for content/entertainment with drama, the ooc from the pd annoyed alot of people. But the argument could then be, it was on purpose for content
[1:38:13] bluntguardian420: ruth just had it out for K
[1:38:14] Yzma1: they didnt even check that shit
[1:38:17] bigfoot7802: K and ramme were already claiming they had multiple guns
[1:38:17] steffan_cbs: nope
[1:38:21] Jessimi: Its going to be very hard to convince K to take it to court. :(
[1:38:23] SturdyDoor: Max bringing up Pardoning again in teh next meeting will throw another lifeline possibly
[1:38:27] Zewelly: ruth is friends with mary so its bias
[1:38:27] RegulatorTTV: Thats assuming cops use logic and well they dont.
[1:38:29] omascas: there is an investigation, people are just rattled
[1:38:30] TechToniic: Yeah, so were no rounds missing? Did PD check?
[1:38:36] nick_dr1ft: they already charged K with it, along with a 30k fine
[1:38:37] goondock9: he hasnt gone to court yet
[1:38:37] ExessiveGK: Slacks told Kay in the search warrant that the warrant was issued because they had a witness that called in and said they seen him with a gun or some shit like that
[1:38:37] paiger1430: @Jessimi all the pd wrongs in his case prove a ton of doubt but would be interesting to see
[1:38:39] vi_horrors: also didnt help that the warrant was push while 2 court cases were happening and a raid so k had no way to defend himself legally
[1:38:41] steffan_cbs: never talk to mary
[1:38:41] MikeTorcido: he wants a trial today
[1:38:48] Steelhuf: Its all going to depend on what K is going to do moving forward
[1:38:50] chvz__: that whole situation is insane
[1:38:53] dankNbeans: @TigerHeli79 in cops defense, Ramee was pulling a dead body out of a car, so it tracks
[1:38:53] titanvol29: Nope lol
[1:38:55] ItsJoey_E: you would think
[1:38:56] YumboYak25: Shits crazy
[1:38:57] mystic_mic: I thiught with the new throwing mechanic crims would toss the weapon
[1:38:58] Jessimi: paiger1430 I'd love to see a case. But I suspect its going to be a Demon Time arc instead.
[1:38:59] pustilence: THEY DIDNT because they are new and untrained
[1:39:01] smokebreezy: but they dont do police work
[1:39:01] b_goodhue: Either way one of those ppl had a PD gun if he got shot with no grlar
[1:39:04] RegulatorTTV: I watched the vids it was stupidity lol
[1:39:05] b_goodhue: Gsr
[1:39:10] giggles5502: Plus the gun k had on him was one of the first guns that was taken from a cop cuz there was no serial number yet like now there is
[1:39:10] Zewelly: did you see the cop shooting the tanker? then denying it
[1:39:12] steffan_cbs: @Timmac you need be the lawyer
[1:39:12] halos420: go for a quick burger run then its grime time
[1:39:14] paiger1430: @Jessimi I hope they do a case then demon time anyway
[1:39:16] DarthMeggsy: back to good ol criminal mastermind Mr. K
[1:39:18] dirtytissue69: the cops think it was two guns involved anyway
[1:39:24] ellystacklebox: Fail rp by the cops really. Automatically assumed k and ramee guilty and then they had to run with it and still trying to justify it. Mega -1
[1:39:24] TigerHeli79: @TigerHeli79 you forget the other people still on the scene
[1:39:26] bigfoot7802: hoping they can at least appeal today before K goes demon mode lol
[1:39:28] Crazybro: Slacks sat outside Mary's house for over an hour that night after K's shooting... he IS investigating.
[1:39:31] slavanero: they dont know  firearm safety
[1:39:36] nick_dr1ft: they have already charged K with it, along with a 30k fine for it, and just told him to appeal
[1:39:40] buckwild6: They based everything in him being in the drivrt seat.
[1:39:40] ItsJoey_E: you can hand to him
[1:39:42] beastly_kush: you can
[1:39:42] Jessimi: A LOT of the awkwardness through this was missing/awkward game mechanics.
[1:39:43] dankNbeans: powergaming, i learned that term yesterday
[1:39:43] b_goodhue: K said they pulled him out
[1:39:47] bibidi00: you can giver it to him
[1:39:48] Lamb_Hawk: try tru
[1:39:48] Morfius53_: They said K was taken out and put back
[1:39:49] ExessiveGK: I think what they were arguing against K about is that there wasn't another gun that the gun that shot him was the gun that was planted on him is what they were trying to say the reasoning was
[1:39:50] 0Trish0: yea just like how they know u can only have 4-6 ppl
[1:39:54] Grickshaft: didn’t even know how to find houses
[1:39:54] halos420: only person that could claim that he was still in the car is johnson and he doesnt serem super bright KEKW
[1:39:55] Hey_its_Mady: You can hand things to someone in car
[1:39:56] RegulatorTTV: Yea they where supper meta about it for sure
[1:39:57] emrejonson: its going to be who can prove which seat K was sitting in
[1:39:57] Lamb_Hawk: tru tru*
[1:40:00] beastly_kush: you can hand it to someone in the car
[1:40:00] 4_Sak3n: they didnt pull him out ramee did
[1:40:02] VirtualVoyager: @Zewelly wow, ok. you are that bias... ok, K is a saint. lmao
[1:40:04] timedoggg: you can hand people stuff in the car @Timmac
[1:40:04] Nagini_Rowle_: Ramee told cops he was taken robbed and put into the car
[1:40:09] chvz__: I honestly do still feel most of those cops look at K and Ramee as the criminals they were 3.0 and not following the civ rp they’re doing in 4.0
[1:40:12] bigfoot7802: true, you can actually hand things to people in cars now
[1:40:13] xtylaw: k and ramee story was they put him in car
[1:40:15] smokebreezy: out side the house is crazy
[1:40:16] Hey_its_Mady: Yep
[1:40:18] bluntguardian420: yea
[1:40:20] TangoWhsky: K was already framed once before. They should have put more trust into him saying the gun was planted.
[1:40:21] bibidi00: yes
[1:40:21] ItsJoey_E: yes
[1:40:23] beastly_kush: yes
[1:40:23] giggles5502: And k told them who it was that shot him and that the cops let them go before they were even questioned
[1:40:24] MissinMyTeeth: yeah you can
[1:40:24] Jessimi: Yes
[1:40:24] MrYeOLDsNIPeR: Yes you can
[1:40:26] bigfoot7802: I think you can
[1:40:26] giggles5502: Yes
[1:40:27] emrejonson: you cant seat people to drivers seat though
[1:40:30] halos420: the only cop that seen mr k in the car would have been johnson. and he isnt the brightest lightbulb
[1:40:30] numbblol: yes
[1:40:32] ItsJoey_E: no
[1:40:33] YxtBomb: bro the clip of johnson pulling up to ramee and THEN the clip of johnson comming on the radio is just really bad
[1:40:33] nick_dr1ft: yeah you can
[1:40:33] ichigoone: cohhGV
[1:40:36] beautifullybroken98: yes
[1:40:36] theonyxedition: no someone can "give"
[1:40:36] j0nnyfiver: no go cannot
[1:40:38] ExessiveGK: Yeah case story is that they dragged him out and was putting them back in the car and kidnapping Romney too and then the cop showed back up is why they took off
[1:40:39] coldbleb: test it PepeLaugh
[1:40:39] Jaafil: no
[1:40:39] bluemagic212121: its same as give keys
[1:40:39] smokebreezy: no not anymore
[1:40:40] Zewelly: @VirtualVoyager he isnt a saint but cops have no reason to push hard on K when he hasnt done anything yet in rp
[1:40:42] MrYeOLDsNIPeR: People can "GIVE" you an item when you are down.
[1:40:42] bigfoot7802: you can't check when your down
[1:40:43] drunkcandyxx: its weird because they raided him because someone said he had a gun but on the other hand he said they had guns and who they were and no warrant issued
[1:40:44] paiger1430: @TangoWhsky true thats good evidence and he's turned in pd equipment before
[1:40:47] MissinMyTeeth: no you could hand someone dead on the ground something
[1:40:49] ItsJoey_E: someone can hand you it
[1:40:51] Hey_its_Mady: Others can hand you stuff even 8f you're down
[1:40:55] Morfius53_: @4_Sak3n true, but they told the cops that K was taken out, gun planted and put back. there's no evidence stating otherwise.
[1:40:55] b_goodhue: Either way they had a Pd gun cuz ramee and k were gsr negative
[1:40:56] standbyrogue: @halos420 putting that politely DinoDance
[1:40:56] xtylaw: cant check but can give items
[1:40:56] Roc525: if we're being real K shouldn't have been rolling with the gun 24/7 lol
[1:40:57] gumpZ__: yuno put food on k when he was down at the prison
[1:41:09] MrYeOLDsNIPeR: but not the other way around
[1:41:14] BurpYeah: @chvz__ I agree may not be intentional but subconsciously I think they are as well
[1:41:23] Sonicfear: Every cop in LSPD went through the Academy and was trained, so unless you can cross examine said officers and get them to stumble on safety protocol and firearm traning....claiming they are new and untrained is a huge stretch.
[1:41:24] bigfoot7802: @Roc525 he literally intended to use it there
[1:41:25] hillbillymothman: hillbillymothman subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 26 months! 
[1:41:26] StreamElements: timmacHYPE timmacH Welcome back, hillbillymothman! timmacHI
[1:41:29] MONSTERSbruh: I hate that it was Johnson that was the first on scene, because I love that cop character, but way too often he clowns arounds on duty, which is why he comes across as an idiot/corrupt
[1:41:29] YxtBomb: the fact the cops didnt chase the speeding away car is kinda crazyyy
[1:41:31] VirtualVoyager: @Zewelly cops have  enough brain cells to understand K is trying to  manipulate  them to go against Mary and the llarp guy
[1:41:35] Jessimi: The poor lawyer too... he was like "wtf did I just sign up for??" lol
[1:41:35] halos420: @standbyrogue tbf tho the police dont have enough johnsons. you need some funny character incompetent cops.
[1:41:37] giggles5502: @roc525 yeah true but he was on a mission to kidnap Mary
[1:41:43] RegulatorTTV: talking meta
[1:41:44] ItsJoey_E: yea
[1:41:44] smokebreezy: ye
[1:41:45] beastly_kush: yes
[1:41:47] bibidi00: yes you cana test it out
[1:41:48] berfsta82: they tried to argue because you cant put people in the driver seat it cant be planted
[1:41:48] nick_dr1ft: they pulled him out to rob him
[1:41:49] tinydemian: yeah you can actually
[1:41:50] streptomyces: Crane thought it was a little weird that the warrant got signed, but that’s on the judge, not the PD. honestly PD just doing their jobs.
[1:41:51] Azzarill: its just an item ?

[1:41:52] b_goodhue: Either way those guys had a PD gun to shoot Mr k
[1:41:56] nick_dr1ft: and yes, you can actually
[1:41:59] standbyrogue: @halos420 also true, when he rolled up to the block and noped out did make me giggle
[1:41:59] RatBones69: K needs Gomer to assist his lawyer when and if his case goes to court
[1:42:00] buckwild6: But you can give them a gun, then put them in the car
[1:42:01] smokebreezy: u can give id from car to people
[1:42:07] Sneaks: @giggles5502 He wasn't, he even said they were just scoping and watching trying slow burn.
[1:42:09] Roc525: @bigfoot7802 i know, i meant in general. he was bound to get caught eventually
[1:42:13] Zewelly: @VirtualVoyager how? he was gsr negative and got shot? manipulate them to do what? investigate the shooter?
[1:42:20] halos420: @standbyrogue thats good RP. one cop is in danger there
[1:42:20] nick_dr1ft: @b_goodhue yeah, which is also the only logical conclusion to the case
[1:42:26] bigfoot7802: @bigfoot7802 Its K though. Its what he does lol
[1:42:35] daskaputtja: All I'm saying is that RP is going to be great. Let it play out chat
[1:42:41] RegulatorTTV: RegulatorTTV subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[1:42:41] StreamElements: timmacHYPE timmacH Welcome back, RegulatorTTV! timmacHI
[1:42:43] VirtualVoyager: @Zewelly exactly because the amount of timmes he said that to the police and pushing the police to go against them
[1:42:45] giggles5502: @b_goodhue right and they knew k was down and they still let all them go
[1:42:45] iCLUTCH193: LMAO
[1:42:47] bibidi00: yes
[1:42:47] YxtBomb: Yes lol
[1:42:48] coldbleb: NODDERS
[1:42:50] MONSTERSbruh: Yes
[1:42:50] ExessiveGK: 😂
[1:42:51] bigfoot7802: 100% KEKW
[1:42:51] reaves75stl: no we dont > kill the cops
[1:42:51] xl_scout_lx: yes
[1:42:52] Lepaca: 110%
[1:42:53] Hizzen: Yes
[1:42:53] omascas: cops RP that stuff as well, they keep calling on each other every time someone reads the label on bills, it's a Meme on Esfands chat because he outright read washed cash once. as far as mechanics, the mechanic doesn't matter for RP, if a cop finds a gun on the person the best narrative wins, you can't claim what slot the gun was in
[1:42:56] xtylaw: yes
[1:42:57] RatBones69: Umm..until proven innocent yes he was
[1:43:01] dankNbeans: tell the average Twitch chatter that GTA twitch clips aren't admissable as evidence, and watch their brains melt.
[1:43:02] Morfius53_: Also, K's lawyer said not to talk to the officers before he was taken out for the raid. So K not complying, was just him listening to his lawyer no?
[1:43:09] Steelhuf: Almost at 20 sub for the 2 hour mark lets go!!
[1:43:10] standbyrogue: i quite agree, but it seems that some cops are very good at rp, some well yeah
[1:43:14] ExessiveGK: They charge them for stealing eight prison buses and then dropped it down to five
[1:43:14] robert__tokking: He got caught slacking.  No doubt he will get it back in blood
[1:43:16] fergy123: tbf he said he wasnt mad at that he was mad at the way they treat him and ignored the other side
[1:43:17] paiger1430: there is enough crazy stuff that is happened in this case that would provide a great court case
[1:43:22] MrYeOLDsNIPeR: @Timmac Can the police make a final judgement based on mechanics?
[1:43:22] tombo901: I think he's more mad the others didn't have anything happen yet but agree he did do what he was charged with
[1:43:23] YxtBomb: @dankNbeans i think everyone knows this, its just crazy to see the meta and how the cops handled it
[1:43:23] suijay: I think it’s more of the investigation side is why people are upset
[1:43:25] nck_at_nite: feels like he's not mad about the charge, he's mad about the lack of RP around trying to find the people that shot him and just focusing on him for the rest of the day
[1:43:31] emrejonson: If only Vinny wasnt so selfish
[1:43:33] coffeeatm: @Timmac He wasnt upset abvout the gun, he was upset about the fact that he got treated diffrently
[1:43:37] Hey_its_Mady: K never denied about possession but he's frustrated that pd let other party go scot free from the scene
[1:43:46] vi_horrors: yeah k was up to no good but the whole prosses was kinda bs
[1:43:47] YxtBomb: @Hey_its_Mady 100%
[1:43:48] coldbleb: idk man im sad real estate is gone but im happy demon time might be coming
[1:43:51] OhhhFee: i think its ultimately a difference on opinion on how RP is around the 5 year gap and peoples history
[1:43:51] VirtualVoyager: basically K was doing to the police the same  chat does to streamers telling them what to do. and the police didnt like that
[1:43:53] ThePatKing: time to learn and move on
[1:43:53] gumpZ__: he got caught slackin. Mary rolling 8 deep and K was just with Ramee
[1:43:55] Steelhuf: @Timmac Slacks even said because of X raid and K raid yesterday the streets are about to burn lol
[1:44:01] RatBones69: K's more mad about how the cops treated the situation with the shooting and his arrest than the charge
[1:44:03] dabadooya710: the whole bus thing at the prison was gold LUL
[1:44:04] CorJam_: Yeah he seems to be most upset or against the fact that they didn't look into his side of the story at all to his knowledge. He said he'll take the charges
[1:44:04] yogibv2: he’s angry at the biased way they’re only pursuing him and not the ones who shot
[1:44:06] Zewelly: to me it feels like people are using past chang gang rep to influence how 4.0 is going
[1:44:07] getrektlosernerd: @coldbleb its not gobw
[1:44:12] ExessiveGK: Yeah Kay never disagreed about the gun charge what he was trying to pass a point to was the fact that the cops were there as they were being kidnapped and took their statement saying he had a gun and let them go
[1:44:14] getrektlosernerd: @coldbleb gone
[1:44:15] bigfoot7802: @Hey_its_Mady he 100% denied it was his. Said it must have been planted
[1:44:17] RegulatorTTV: That's like saying it's ok for cops to violate your rights if you're a criminal. thats some tyrannical type shit. lol

[1:44:29] mistacastro01: the reason for the search which the cop stated didn’t make much sense “to make sure he doesn’t have any weapons on the ambulance ride”. shouldn’t they search everyone at the hospital then ?

[2:26:12] paiger1430: @A_Mad_Boar so strong
[2:26:14] Morfius53_: But the scope of the warrant was just for pd equipment no? Would they be able to charge for anything else?

[2:27:03] NumaanNawaz: how much money do you make on one run
[2:27:08] giggles5502: @krazysquirel yeah but Murphy was grs positive and k wasnt
[2:27:09] MrYeOLDsNIPeR: Honestly, court is just as volatile.
[2:27:11] YxtBomb: @timedoggg Thanks for the gift sub!
[2:27:19] NugsZA: if they found illegal stuff in the rentals he would have to fight it in court with contracts but then his basically like a rat, throwing tenants under the bus timmacLUL timmacLUL
[2:27:31] Morfius53_: @killogic916 gotcha. Makes sense, ty
[2:27:34] RegulatorTTV: @Krazysquirel yea but Murphy was GSR positive so similar but different.
[2:27:51] getyourownjeeves: blew my mind that chris is also ratchet itsKGU is great at voices

[2:29:24] mikecollin12: @regulatorttv it was amazing rp though. What K created from prison was mind blowing
[2:29:39] xl_scout_lx: Murphy's case set the precedence that being in possession of a government firearm is illegal. Period point blank. GSR does not matter.
[2:30:01] fiction12211: k made so much rp out of nothing last night he’s the goat

[2:30:20] paiger1430: @RegulatorTTV like the sheer amount of mistakes rules in K's favour of appeal and he's turned in pd equipment before so why they don't believe him is actually crazy even if we know he is lying about some of it
[2:30:29] StreamElements: timmacHYPE timmacH Welcome back, panic_genesis! timmacHI
[2:30:36] RegulatorTTV: @mikecollin12 correct but the charges were processed without proper investigation. More than enough potential to create doubt just no thought went into it.
[2:30:41] MrCythe: K made content while in prison. it was funny AF. not mentioning names. but someone else that got put in prison f8 to alter game
[2:30:48] MrCythe: to another game**
[2:31:05] mistacastro01: @xl_scout_lx not necessarily. a big reason for Murphy being found guilty is his angle of playing “memory loss”. murphy shot himself in the foot
[2:31:14] cptburritobeard: LUL LUL
[2:31:38] RegulatorTTV: @paiger1430 I agree. He had a speeding ticket before that and by all accounts was an upstanding business man with multiple investments and employees

[2:32:20] skruhhbish: LUL
[2:32:20] barlowstopbanningalisten: Mr K makes a rp that was new with the real estate and they called him a slum lord
[2:32:25] VHD7: toonyLaugh
[2:33:00] RegulatorTTV: @paiger1430 I think kevin is itching to go a bit crazy this was just the excuse. lol
[2:33:06] henri23232323: Would Mr K be up today?
[2:33:14] New_York_E: I don’t get why they treated k like a criminal the whole time
[2:33:15] barlowstopbanningalisten: I think K goes crazy anyway just based of the principle they done nothing to the other guys
[2:33:25] NugsZA: yeah i think it will eventually be worked out its new they need to "impliment" it so im sure it will come right if its just handle correctly
[2:33:41] Kxart: Mr. K will do pounder runs later :D
[2:33:53] skaiixd: yesterday was crazy. i hadnt seen shit pop off like that in a minute KEKW
[2:33:55] paiger1430: @RegulatorTTV LOL probably, thing that sucks is the RP behind a court case would be fire but sometimes they can be a bit boring after like a 3 hr case like this would be
[2:34:44] cptburritobeard: Pee out the window LUL
[2:34:45] derprite: I want to see PD blood all over the streets
[2:34:45] xl_scout_lx: @mistacastro01 The arguments in the case don't matter because that's going to change case to case. The judge ruled him guilty of being in possession of a government issued firearm, regardless of what he did or didn't do with it, and that set the precedence that just having it is illegal.
[2:34:45] barlowstopbanningalisten: he said he was going to court today at the end with slacks or Am I wrong
[2:34:47] MrYeOLDsNIPeR: any court case with K = great content
[2:34:50] hopalong92: @barlowstopbanningalisten I think it is going to be spicy today
[2:34:55] dankNbeans: K creates drama because drama creates opportunity for RP.  that's it, that's what he does.  chat getting emotional is on chat, lol.
[2:34:56] RegulatorTTV: CG should kill cops steal their guns and plant them on judges, lawyers and squeaky clean peps. Once 30 + people have gun charges maybe the laws will change a bit or maybe some logic will be applied. lol
[2:35:04] skruhhbish: K said he going on a killing spree
[2:35:05] NugsZA: is k doing a trial?
[2:35:10] skruhhbish: Ruth at the top
[2:35:10] Fantasmx: LUL
[2:35:11] berfsta82: good luck convincing him of that

[2:35:24] jsouza31: I think he wants a bench trial
[2:35:24] derprite: I hope they spawn camp ruth
[2:35:28] ShadowSithBane: might depend on the court case
[2:35:29] henri23232323: Ruth is gonna die today
[2:35:30] paiger1430: good point
[2:35:30] RegulatorTTV: oh he is going crazy for sure. He was raging
[2:35:33] Rabidwizardeye: k goin on a rampage

[2:35:46] Fury_dr: I'm torn. i want to see a killing spree/chaos but also want him to keep the business arc going too lol
[2:35:48] MarkusC12: k said no more civ and he expects Richard to murder a cop
[2:35:48] Lordbidwell: No one knows what k is gonna do but k
[2:35:52] hopalong92: I think he will take an appeal and go to trial today
[2:35:54] GeorgeVanSmooth: Going to be some great RP
[2:35:56] mikecollin12: Chat cbill
[2:36:07] barlowstopbanningalisten: I think gomer can calm him down as long as he keeps him busy
[2:36:10] doktou: did you see cornwoods reaction  when he gave him his sim card right after getting released? LUL
[2:36:11] mikecollin12: Just because K says somethi
[2:36:13] derprite: he can do killing on side while business
[2:36:13] MrYeOLDsNIPeR: No way K gives up on Section K
[2:36:15] Zewelly: mr k can talk too, so him in court would be ez
[2:36:21] HurricaneHurley: his business can never be looked at as legit now with his felony no?
[2:36:26] NugsZA: i mean its a good idea and realistic
[2:36:28] paiger1430: true!
[2:36:28] ZappyPenny: @timedoggg thank you for the gifted sub…
[2:36:29] xxteeko: i mean they rented the rentals after saying they wouldnt before he started the whole realstate arc
[2:36:30] ShadowSithBane: I mean if city council says no what can you do.  there is no way to beat them with rp
[2:36:31] coldbleb: NODDERS
[2:36:33] Epo24: he was heated
[2:36:34] Fantasmx: We need Gomer to talk to K out of it (killing spree)
[2:36:37] xxteeko: raided*
[2:36:44] DSM4Life92: @Lordbidwell dont even think K knows what K is gonna do lol
[2:36:47] arch_dawg: there are ways to pass the business off and have K in the background. just a matter of what the council will pass at this point
[2:36:50] irishmf_24: He's got a felony doing section K would not look good anymore
[2:36:50] RegulatorTTV: I've watched Kebun and CG for years. love the boys but the worst idea ever is to try to do legit business with CG lol

[2:37:14] A_Mad_Boar: It's fine chat just breathe let rp happen
[2:37:18] 8R00KS: since he didnt shoot
[2:37:24] barlowstopbanningalisten: I’ll be honest I want to see Ruth die too but it’s gonna ruin Mr K life if he’s caught
[2:37:27] MrYeOLDsNIPeR: How can he be a convicted FELON without a trial??
[2:37:31] arch_dawg: K doesn’t have to be the front person. probably better long term if he’s not
[2:37:31] j0nnyfiver: Dan will give him a business license regardless
[2:37:36] j0nnyfiver: Dab

[2:38:03] HurricaneHurley: crane has dab on a leash he cant just pass w/e he wants
[2:38:16] ShadowSithBane: @j0nnyfiver he can’t the council has the say
[2:38:38] Fury_dr: Would it be feasible to "sell" section K to like OTT or someone, essentially to be the face while K still owns it in the background?
[2:38:39] SlightlyAwkward: People getting too invested in RP, sit back and enjoy the Gomer train!
[2:38:42] RafflebotXD: The council is super against felons owning buisinesses
[2:38:44] ShadowSithBane: basically th mayor election was useless lol
[2:38:45] j0nnyfiver: from what I heard the council doesn’t vote on business licenses. that’s Dab and Simone
[2:38:45] barlowstopbanningalisten: if K gets with Ramee first the killing will probably happen but if he gets with gomer I think it’ll be fine
[2:38:49] MrYeOLDsNIPeR: @Gr1mington smh
[2:38:54] coldbleb: Is Gomer gonna be apart of the heists crew when the bank jobs come out?
[2:38:58] MarkusC12: he said it’s over since he has a felony if he didn’t he would keep going

[2:45:54] dubo18: a good defence for mr k is that the motorcycles pulling up on them coz if they foyer request all motorcycle comes the last week. to a guy that has a clean record that’s the only way I reckon and they pit the gun on him

[2:47:12] OhhhFee: ya im sad about that one. City didnt respect the vision
[2:47:20] Lordbidwell: Hopefully when the packer comes the money will fallow
[2:47:20] 21grains: @pigscanflyhigh that’s why I’m saying I don’t think K will be cooled down. I find it hard to believe he wins the appeal
[2:47:25] Torrok: pigscanflyhigh you don't know that if you aint appealing it, you can't just assume the judge is as dumb
[2:47:34] nick_dr1ft: @pigscanflyhigh no way, he was told that since he wasnt able to be given a bench trial, he was to appeal the charges
[2:47:54] RatBones69: was a horrible precedent to set if items can be placed on your body at any time
[2:47:57] MarkusC12: @21grains totally agree
[2:48:04] MrYeOLDsNIPeR: @Timmac can you sell this truck ?
[2:48:04] pigscanflyhigh: @Torrok There is no "dumb" its just that K cannot prove gun was planted. So it is she said he said.
[2:48:10] DSM4Life92: @j0nnyfiver lets be real 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, Prodigy, and 4.0 CG has and always be sbs its just how they are
[2:48:15] nick_dr1ft: @RatBones69 yeah and they can
[2:48:31] Torrok: pigscanflyhigh they also cant prove it was not planted
[2:48:36] pigscanflyhigh: @nick_dr1ft He can appeal ofc

[2:49:00] nick_dr1ft: @pigscanflyhigh other than the fact is shots were fired, and both K and Ramee were gsr negative so has to be the other party also had a gun

[3:44:20] Fatass_Drew: @Phillyall4one just because he was negative, he was on a scene of a shooting, he was patted down because of where he was and he was down. the only thing the cops got wrong, was not bringing in the other side of the shooting
[3:44:55] mikecollin12: @phillyall4one only think he was upset at was exactly this not being treated fairly
[3:45:08] Phillyall4one: @Fatass_Drew He got shot and he was negative but yet noone else was tested. Yes he shouldnt of gotten away but the shooter never even got arrested.

[3:52:32] R3dl1nes: place defo needs a refit now
[3:52:34] blimpguy: I mean the basement is known now but maybe you can put a new storage point hidden on second floor
[3:52:35] ex_Gladius: at least it looked good for the raid
[3:52:35] bigfoot7802: is the barrier still in the trap?

[3:57:37] SaltySalel: They documented all the blueprints you guys had, didn't take anything though
[3:57:42] Hey_its_Mady: They took pictures of every BP

[3:57:55] Furyform: They honestly shouldn't be named Weed Rack when they could just be generally named "Drying Rack" :(
[3:57:55] arch_dawg: PD and Govt are not prepared at all to handle properties where people rent / multiple people live. Another bad consequence of not having a provisional government when the city launched
[3:57:57] ItsJoey_E: !meta
[3:57:58] Dtex__: They just took pictures of everything
[3:57:58] Morfius53_: They didnt take anything. They only documented some stuff chat
[3:57:59] RaptorQuiz: ...but the gun had been confiscated from him the day before. They were raiding to look for a gun that was already in their evidence locker?
[3:58:08] sherdon278: some of the cops wanted to seize the washers because the prop has money in it but the actual slots were empty
[3:58:08] R3dl1nes: only things taken was 3 leg splints and an out of date ID card
[3:58:09] brolythechamp: alot of should nots
[3:58:09] wytechocolate650: yeah very dumb
[3:58:10] OssewTV: even if they find criminal stuff. they shouldnt be documenting anyhing that isnt apart of the search.
[3:58:10] mikecollin12: "OH a weed drin
[3:58:18] Azzarill: Cops went out of the scope of the warrant
[3:58:19] mikecollin12: Weed drying wrack
[3:58:21] CasualStoner: They didnt know what it was in the beggining, and they assumed it was bps over the table
[3:58:25] TheBeefster: @RaptorQuiz they said equipment was missing. aka a tazer
[3:58:25] sickbound: and slacks saw the title of the weed rack later called the weed rack, "a rack".
[3:58:26] MrFuzzyBootzz: Blueprints shouldn't be illegal. The only time it should be if it is firearms or explosives
[3:58:26] Cressiduhhhhh: I mean some one asked if gpus were legal.....
[3:58:28] TheApatheticMike: also looked through the pcs
[3:58:29] Lepaca: cops documenting a raid? how dare they! KEKW
[3:58:30] Escavon: what i dont get, is the warrant was for PD weapons.  why are they taking pictures of blue prints and pc stuff
[3:58:33] mikecollin12: Searched through te
[3:58:35] ItsJoey_E: they couldnt even open the barrels they had to spawn keys
[3:58:37] fergy123: Yeah thats what slacks said
[3:58:37] RaptorQuiz: @thebeefster got it
[3:58:38] Invaderon: Waiting
[3:58:39] RegulatorTTV: watching the rade you got to see the cops do alot of dumb stuff
[3:58:39] hippieh8rlol: Raiding for possession of a firearm is dumb. Setting a precedent that you can plant illegal stuff on people and they get insta raided
[3:58:42] Sonicfear: Taking pictures of all of the blueprints opened seems like a massive meta dump
[3:58:42] mikecollin12: Laundry machines too
[3:58:42] arch_dawg: might as well be a clothes rack. same funtiin
[3:58:42] treynrek: Without weed on it it's just a wood rack
[3:58:43] bigfoot7802: yeah, slacks corrected it and said it was a wooden rack
[3:58:46] Lordsharok: drying jerky
[3:58:47] arch_dawg: function*
[3:58:48] wibs14: slacks shut down all the officers talking about the washing machines
[3:58:49] RegulatorTTV: raid*
[3:58:50] OinkerNOR: Life goooes oooon
[3:58:50] jjb4d: it was funny when Mr K got out of jail and went to PD 5 minutes later to get his phone back and Cornwood OOC saw that Mr K had another gun on him.
[3:58:51] ExessiveGK: the raid warrant specifically said reason of cause was a phone call of a person having a PD weapon
[3:58:52] wibs14: because they were empty
[3:58:56] Cypher_5: yeah the title shouldnt matter it was -1
[3:58:58] CasualStoner: Slacks agrees, it was cornwood and other cops kinda wondering what to do with it
[3:59:03] NayNayGG: i think it's that the server is new. cops are just learning
[3:59:04] sherdon278: @ItsJoey_E but thats just cuz 4.0 is out too early not pd fault
[3:59:11] seamus_souleater: @OssewTV Nah they can absolutely seize it if it's in an area that a gun could be. It's part of search and seizure law.
[3:59:15] mikecollin12: The blueprint name tho is weed drying rack
[3:59:16] CasualStoner: I would imagine no one writes "WEED RACK" bluwprints on a paper
[3:59:18] killogic916: Cornwood wanted to take everything Saab had to reel him in
[3:59:29] Hey_its_Mady: Slacks stopped that immediately and said its just a wooden rack. Cops were really pushing for dumb shit
[3:59:35] gamma_smash: some cops were saying why are they washing money lol
[3:59:36] Steelhuf: @Timmac https://clips.twitch.tv/IgnorantAgitatedEggnogStinkyCheese-6zIUdo89D-6c0LQq
[3:59:37] killogic916: Cornwood even wanted to do something about the washers
[3:59:38] arch_dawg: @killogic916 honestly think he was more bored than anything shotzLul shotzLul shotzLul
[3:59:39] treynrek: Last night K was wilding out, it was hilarious
[3:59:41] R3dl1nes: @ExessiveGK yup that hearsay  but ruth and grey are friends with mary
[3:59:41] Apollose_: I mean they were interested in the washers because the money animation, even though they were empty. So... Just learning
[3:59:42] sugarloafah: Slacks was good about that last night - cops were trying to push the laundry machines due to the animation of cash in there, but with actual cash in it, slacks was making sure to be like "its just a washing machine"
[3:59:42] Cypher_5: they RP 'd the washers out but didnt on the racks
[3:59:44] mizledTV: Thats what Slacks said about the washing machine. One officer said "I see money in a washing machine" but Slacks corrected him
[3:59:45] jared0127: no illigal to have a blueprint no matter what it is
[3:59:45] Cressiduhhhhh: Them talking about the washing machines had me head
[3:59:50] HarreeBaals: Did they ever even give K the warrant before they searched. LUL
[3:59:54] RegulatorTTV: they where like why does he have washing machines and ac units. I dont know maybe he owns a property managment company and buys in bulk. nope must be illegal lol
[3:59:57] Furyform: @HarreeBaals no
[4:00:01] Furyform: he asked countless times
[4:00:01] sherdon278: @killogic916 dont think cornwood but some of the ohers did for sure
[4:00:03] shadowcaster209: What are you eating
[4:00:04] bigfoot7802: @Hey_its_Mady I don;t think they were pushing. This is brand new to all of them.
[4:00:05] MrFuzzyBootzz: @jared0127 wrong if it is a firearm or explosive device it can be
[4:00:06] jared0127: illegal8
[4:00:11] mikecollin12: @harreebaals  lawyer did get it not K tho
[4:00:12] CasualStoner: They rpd out the washing machines but if slacks wasnt there i doubt it would LUL
[4:00:43] ExessiveGK: @MrFuzzyBootzz that's not entirely true
[4:00:56] R3dl1nes: tbh the PD messed this whole RP up but not doing the invesgating correctly and not detailing mary and her crew
[4:00:57] sickbound: slacks said theres nothing illegal about blueprints unless theres something to prove they actually made it
[4:00:57] getrektlosernerd: nope
[4:00:58] halos420: they didnt
[4:00:59] hippieh8rlol: Properties Def should be under gomers name though to avoid raid stuff in the future
[4:00:59] R3dl1nes: as well
[4:00:59] Steelhuf: nope
[4:00:59] sherdon278: they did
[4:01:00] zypher01: They didnt LUL
[4:01:03] ItsJoey_E: moved i think
[4:01:04] ShadowFennixx: huh
[4:01:07] jhazlett37: I hope this was an isolated incident not the same old cop shit from 3.0

[4:01:27] sherdon278: they did
[4:01:29] getyourownjeeves: the role play has been great but the sever is more sims then gta
[4:01:29] zypher01: They barely found the entrance. If you couldnt see the bench because the floor is gone they might not have found it
[4:01:31] fergy123: They did see it
[4:01:32] Azzarill: they were talking about the cash in washer though
[4:01:33] Laibia: I know Cornwood did
[4:01:41] sherdon278: when you look in the washer you also see the ground in the UI
[4:01:48] digital_ken: good song
[4:01:49] guatemalalibre: this song but the longer version, FIIIIRE
[4:01:49] sherdon278: but not phisycally
[4:01:50] killogic916: Is it a rule to not just seal off the basement with a wall if a raid is coming instead of cleaning it out?
[4:01:52] Fossabot: SingsNote Current Song: deadmau5 - Strobe - Radio Edit https://open.spotify.com/track/0ubZ5nFWwxKoYJ7hk6TaRm SingsNote
[4:01:55] nickh1981: clip or it didnt happen lol  @sherdon278
[4:01:58] TripleJAllDay: i swear they are only doing this to get you guys and x to start havok in the city
[4:02:04] CasualStoner: slacks was very objective with it, he didnt stall too much in there and didnt care for stuff that was under the washers and stuff
[4:02:11] sherdon278: @nickh1981 watch cornwood stream
[4:02:16] Steelhuf: The search warrant was only for PD equipment
[4:02:19] zypher01: Too late
[4:02:20] Furyform: @jhazlett37 A bit late for that. A few parts of the city are already turning in response to a lot of this and other recent events
[4:02:24] sherdon278: @sherdon278 vod*
[4:02:25] zypher01: they made them the only source of ammo
[4:02:27] Cressiduhhhhh: K and X gonna be on demon time today lol
[4:02:31] jhazlett37: demon K is coming
[4:02:34] mikecollin12: Someone went into computers too I believe
[4:02:35] ShadowFennixx: i feel raids happend to fast
[4:02:35] ExessiveGK: @Steelhuf yes
[4:02:47] Morfius53_: @killogic916 I was thinking the same thing LUL just block the entrance with a wall
[4:02:47] nickh1981: clip @sherdon278 lol
[4:02:49] LowAnimal: Sup Timmac
[4:02:52] sherdon278: But do they not need K to be at the raid?
[4:02:58] sherdon278: @nickh1981 im good
[4:02:58] xmamerro: half the cops are grinders
[4:03:00] Cressiduhhhhh: @sherdon278 no
[4:03:03] Apollose_: cornwood electricuted himself on the heaters lol
[4:03:13] TripleJAllDay: well you wanted more intense content you said you were getting to comfortable lol
[4:03:15] Furyform: They tried to get K to do the raid but kept asking him for where the houses were, when they had the capability of finding it themselves
[4:03:17] ExessiveGK: I don't think raids are bad, I think raids shouldn't be conducting when the PD doesn't have proper trainer
[4:03:20] CasualStoner: a lot of the cops when they went in there didnt even know what they were looking for
[4:03:23] bigfoot7802: @ShadowFennixx they should. Whole point is to catch something before it has a chance to get cleaned out
[4:03:34] AkMagicz: cornwood going into K’s pockets when he came out of jail was hilarious
[4:03:51] BayneGaming: very dirty
[4:03:51] zypher01: They did Mr. K real dirty yesterday
[4:03:59] Furyform: @AkMagicz he had a good recovery tho, asking if he could just give stuff back and letting K say no
[4:04:01] sherdon278: getting all his houses was kinda dirty
[4:04:06] sherdon278: but i guess no laws orso
[4:04:09] seamus_souleater: In before Timmac I must have earned prio KappaLUL
[4:04:11] TripleJAllDay: its gonna be a good appeal court case
[4:04:16] Apollose_: Big fines. He needs more Gomer money now.
[4:04:17] Sonicfear: They'd have needed to find anything to connect the washers or racks to illicit activity, which they didn't. Plus the scope of the warrant was only for PD Equipment, so even the taking of photos of the blueprints could be thrown in court, out of the warrant's scoep.
[4:04:21] ItsJoey_E: especially when they put out the warant when hes in pd
[4:04:21] Steelhuf: It was funny when Ramee was going house to house yelling your being raided because X need him to and K
[4:04:21] LowAnimal: K got done very dirty :( But it was still fun to watch. The RP was still there regardless.
[4:04:22] BayneGaming: they took him in and out of PD like 3 times cause they couldnt fiind his house lol
[4:04:27] MorriLagadO: I just think they are doing stuff that can fuck someones life in the begging of this economy without too much thought,
[4:04:30] A_Mad_Boar: If they keep acting 3.0-ish i don't think anyones going to like the result
[4:04:37] zypher01: Need to put floors so you cant see the bench through the bushes imo
[4:04:45] zypher01: guess it might not matter now
[4:04:47] Hey_its_Mady: Honestly why raid houses when can't even find them. Like why rush into things then punish K for it
[4:04:55] insaneclowncilposse: gun planting season
[4:04:58] ExessiveGK: Mr K talked to judges about the houses before he bought them, he was told if they were raided even with contracts on rental he would just have to take it to court
[4:05:01] Furyform: The raid feels like someone is going after server rules, instead of los santos laws
[4:05:03] sherdon278: I wonder if k is actually going demon mode today, would be content
[4:05:20] br00zie: Things always change and get better....
[4:05:20] zypher01: Think they mean the end of 3.0 when they left to prodigy
[4:05:30] inkfierry: 3.0 just went stale
[4:05:32] amakarov87: the end of 3.0 was garbo
[4:05:39] br00zie: theyve added so much to NoPixel 4.0
[4:05:40] henri23232323: Is not bad but end was bad
[4:05:41] BayneGaming: @sherdon278 for sure he is.
[4:05:43] DeafLate: When people say that its always me thinking they are speaking with Nostalgia-coated glasses LUL
[4:05:46] MrFuzzyBootzz: I wanna see K pop off, but i feel he has a solid chance of getting his money and shit back even with a little payout maybe
[4:05:49] CasualStoner: *Bass shifts on his grave*
[4:05:58] darkdemonwiz: 3.0 meowfurion case was great on all sides
[4:06:01] shanejo127: It's just the end that was really bad.
[4:06:02] Lepaca: @francewon_ you clearly have not been watching KEKW
[4:06:03] TripleJAllDay: ive been in so many places 4.0 is beyond what any other server can do right now they are working out the kinks and bugs
[4:06:05] br00zie: The Police MDT is  better than 3.0 isnt it?
[4:06:06] insaneclowncilposse: treating k like 3.0 k is bad.
[4:06:06] kingFirmUK: the rp in the future is going to be crazy
[4:06:06] LavosTRD: it was shitty with the timing of everything.  everyone else was tied up with the trial. so the only people left had no clue what they were doing
[4:06:07] henri23232323: I dnt think Ruth knew what she was doing yesterday
[4:06:10] Apollose_: Just kinda feels like an extension of the island. Cops v server
[4:06:15] Civrock: Bad faith chatters.

[4:06:24] Lepaca: my strimmer got arrested alot, garbo Madge
[4:06:28] jhazlett37: @mrfuzzybootzz zero chance. Judge Murphy Braun was found guilty
[4:06:30] DeafLate: I was a cop in 3.0.... FeelsBadMan
[4:06:34] R3dl1nes: the cops last nite defo felt like the 3.0 cops
[4:06:39] Apollose_: But this sets the stage for big RP and thats what we all want.
[4:06:39] zypher01: Theres a reason the boys left the server no?
[4:06:43] br00zie: the devs dont really make the experience, the players do.
[4:06:44] R3dl1nes: old ways
[4:06:45] mrgreen941: Cops are goldfish brains. That's for sure.
[4:06:49] ThiccEwok: Why does all .0's suck dick
[4:06:52] TheTitanic: the only thing i see is alot of pd not treating people as a new person. using past against them. thats the cause of most of this
[4:07:00] CasualStoner: Only thing i didnt understand is why Ruth was pushing so hard on a supposedly Civilian...it was kinda crazy to watch tbh
[4:07:00] sherdon278: @zypher01 just for something new not because they disliked 3.0
[4:07:05] br00zie: The devs give a canvas for the players to express themselves on.
[4:07:11] dankNbeans: i just hope the constant scuff is fixed.  it's like listening to your favorite album on a scratched CD.
[4:07:15] TTLcute: @jhazlett37 his lawyers didn't argue his case correctly at all though.
[4:07:17] ExessiveGK: My biggest gripe about any server is the powers of abuse in high roles, hard thing to figure it out, my old servers, there was no expectations with people of power
[4:07:21] MrFuzzyBootzz: @jhazlett37 Murphy wasnt GSR neg so means he did shoot a gun and he had one, K was neg so them planting it as a cover is good shot
[4:07:26] ouumarelmir: 3.0 was prime content and soo fun to watch , from X malding to cops going hard to cg umbrella , to events , to heists ... etc
[4:07:28] WhoKnowz21: k was not happy he said it felt just like 3.0 how they were treating him.
[4:07:29] R3dl1nes: @CasualStoner because Grey pushed for the raid and ruth took the blunt off k for it so grey didnt get it
[4:07:29] New_York_E: 3.0 not treating k fairly compared to other rpers
[4:07:30] shadowcaster209: What's really is cool is that you're going to see how K is going to turn this into some actually amazing pog RP some how
[4:07:30] treynrek: And its still the beginning where laws aren't exact yet
[4:07:45] Apollose_: Getting held up outside PD for your gun everytime you leave isnt fun either I am sure.
[4:07:46] Snowmobilecrazy: My issue is 4.0 was supposed to be a clean start and i feel some people still hold opinions from before
[4:07:52] br00zie: doesnt matter what server youre on, theres always going to be a power hierarchy
[4:07:52] cbrooks51: so you decide to start a server with no judicial precedence, no police force and no basic human rights….
[4:07:52] StreamElements: GOMER | NoPixel | !phynix | Socials: @timmac
[4:07:53] Furyform: A lot of the referencing of 3.0 cops tho is meant to be in relation to how things went between cop vs crim. The cops recently feel like they've been treating K specifically like his 3.0 days, instead of turning a new leaf and giving him any benefit of the doubt or appearance of fair treatment
[4:07:57] SaltySalel: Yesterday, they really went through it lmao. They got the big three, Dundee, K, and JP all at once practically and none were easy
[4:08:04] LavosTRD: 8? it’s about to be 80 in a couple hours lol
[4:08:10] snorrow92: @Snowmobilecrazy thats what you get when you bring over old characters tho
[4:08:13] SimmerDownBoy: aye I’m just her for the content an good vibes!
[4:08:13] Morfius53_: Being an outsider (wasnt here for 3.0) kinda seems like some people are basing some decisions on the past. Wasnt 4.0 supposed to be a clean slate?
[4:08:16] Lordbidwell: Fuck that
[4:08:19] R3dl1nes: it was Grey that push the Raid ruth just signed off on it along with that creepy judge
[4:08:19] CasualStoner: @R3dl1nes K was fine with the raid...k was upset with the dogshit job the pd did with controling the scene
[4:08:20] mrgreen941: Yeah I get that. I didn't mean all of thr cops. Just quite a few have no idea what they are doing it seems.
[4:08:28] br00zie: Without Police reports, theres no real good Court RP
[4:08:31] Torrok: TheTitanic "A fresh start for me but not for the"
[4:08:38] BayneGaming: i feel like IGNITE was way more relaxed but with less structure
[4:08:38] Lordbidwell: Yeah it's a second job .
[4:08:42] captianmacsparrow: I just want see more shoot outs and crime I mean the game is called grand theft auto
[4:08:43] darkdemonwiz: 4.0 has way to high of pd report standards, they should read real police reports
[4:08:46] FryeDaye: seems exhausting
[4:08:46] atg323: are u ready for war mr k is mad
[4:08:54] gerkins860: yeah PD is a tough gig
[4:08:57] Steelhuf: I feel for slacks he only can leave for 4-5 hours and has to get back on
[4:09:04] DeafLate: Very tough gig
[4:09:05] cbrooks51: Just admit, they rushed the server to get it out for the Sabbath-athon on twitch
[4:09:06] br00zie: 0 hours in RP and criticizes actual RPers
[4:09:09] boss_waka: so many people just assuming smh
[4:09:18] Sonicfear: People calling the goldfish brains...literally understaffed, lack of clear cut penal codes and no legislation put forth yet, the city government only now in place and on top of all that doing their jobs with all these hnderances....Get Real.
[4:09:22] TheTitanic: fair but just because you put alot of time and effort into something doesnt mean your good at it
[4:09:25] anthonytanza001: @atg323 there really isn't much that K can do as of right now
[4:09:28] br00zie: Only knows RP from what they see on twitch
[4:09:31] tinydemian: shit cop? no. shitty situation? yes.
[4:09:33] Ecex93: that's the issue sometimes, put in tot much work and you aint roleplaying anymore
[4:09:33] R3dl1nes: @CasualStoner yeah and am saying it was bad becuses of grey was leading it the very cop that pushed it Ruth was the shield to take it all
[4:09:37] FryeDaye: I think a lot of goodwill is bought by not stonewalling
[4:09:37] irishmf_24: It's stressful but end of the day they arrested K and ramee but did not detain the other people
[4:09:47] KautoStars: ssaab has the hardest job in the server imo
[4:09:48] TripleJAllDay: Officer McMahon for Captain
[4:09:54] anthonytanza001: I love that jacket Gomer is wearing
[4:09:55] digital_ken: Mr. K hurt their feelings and they took it out on him
[4:09:56] dankNbeans: armchair quarterbacks love to hear themselves talk
[4:09:58] SimmerDownBoy: gta rp has great content let’s all agree to disagree
[4:10:03] sherdon278: D:
[4:10:06] Jansbury: Some chatters get mad at the streamer when it should stay about the character
[4:10:16] cdinkel1: yea it is a video game and the cops and admins should treat it that way. stop taking it so serious
[4:10:16] StreamElements: timmacHYPE timmacH NEW SUB! Welcome, ShroudedInPink! timmacHI
[4:10:17] SaltySalel: I enjoyed the content yesterday, I felt like chats were getting too invested and hopping and making it worse. Better to just sit back and watch
[4:10:17] ExessiveGK: I get why they launched live the way they did but that never works out, should of been a soft launch rollout so this issue doesn't happen
[4:10:19] ShroudedInPink: ShroudedInPink subscribed with Prime. 
[4:10:19] MrFuzzyBootzz: I gotta say dealing with the CG boys in jail in a headache for the cops XD they just yell over you when you say anything right or wrong haha
[4:10:19] Evil_Mel: Viewers that have never put in hours in RP don't truly understand the work put into all sides of it
[4:10:19] br00zie: Well, if a cop is treating you harshly IRL, whatre you gonna do about it? File a complaint.....sure...Get revenge....sure..
[4:10:21] Lordbidwell: Yeah sorry not irl cops this is a game timmacUGH
[4:10:26] Froseti: being captain sounds like more work tbh
[4:10:26] fergy123: But Slacks even said it wasnt do right
[4:10:29] jackus1: I've watched saab, he spends hours training, then dealing with multiple calls, everyone in the PD is asking him stuff, trying to do patrols, trying to get RP in with everyone
[4:10:34] kegelblitzzz: Isn't dumb to search the only incapacitated person on a violent crime scene?
[4:10:36] fergy123: done*
[4:10:40] LavosTRD: imo pink cage 2.0 was peak quality RP, it has been a slow decline of RP since then with more and more focused on game mechanics
[4:10:46] ironman5506: the captains were there
[4:10:50] Nitranion: they didnt take his words at any value as they saw him as k from 3.0 not the k who has been doing civ work past 1/2months
[4:10:52] zypher01: Problem is they can affect peoples livelihoods when they do stuff wrong. Cops have almost 0 repercussions unless Ruth hates you
[4:10:57] Lordbidwell: Chat sounds too invested again
[4:11:01] LavosTRD: slash me needs a come back
[4:11:03] New_York_E: they were holding ramee up with a gun and knives and arrested ramee and k very unfair
[4:11:05] sherdon278: @kegelblitzzz he was frisked first, but still a little scummy
[4:11:06] cdinkel1: have shiesty and cornwood having fun and almost fired.
[4:11:07] chat_trigger: @zypher01  true
[4:11:09] arch_dawg: @morfius53_ yeah, 4.0 launches too soon with half baked organization that’s catching up and dragging things down. it’ll sort out, but be a bit rough
[4:11:10] Cressiduhhhhh: @kegelblitzzz they have to pat him down before bringing to hospital to make sure he isnt armed and going to hurt any one after being treated
[4:11:11] CasualStoner: @kegelblitzzz common sense is hard
[4:11:11] atg323: @anthonytanza001 mr k is going to kill any cop he see that what he is going to do
[4:11:13] br00zie: being high up in command at PD is A SHIT TON OF WORK...you need an attention span higher than that of the average twitch chatter

[4:11:21] jwmmgd: PD growth rate to crime is too slow. Which I understand the reasoning behind. But should've balanced it in a way that crime outpaces it at the going rate
[4:11:24] darkdemonwiz: The biggest mistake with 4.0 policing was not being clear upfront with the new character expectation, and too small of a starting staff
[4:11:31] CasualStoner: @SelfSecluded right...they got all the time in the world for that..he is down LUL
[4:11:32] WhoKnowz21: well tbf what I have seen of cpt Ruth she seemed to be more concerned about being right then getting it right.
[4:11:37] henri23232323: I feel if u signed in for something u should do ur best to do it at ur best abilities
[4:11:38] gerkins860: it's almost like a second server is needed for training PD
[4:11:45] TripleJAllDay: a psychological experiment?

[4:12:05] Steelhuf: Richard Incoming
[4:12:08] tmoney7901: What's up bro have you shot a cop today cuz its shotzMag season on pd
[4:12:15] Cressiduhhhhh: @CasualStoner yeah im not say when they should do it or how they did it for that situation i just mean in general
[4:12:15] Lordbidwell: timmacDANCE timmacWIGGLE timmacDANCE timmacWIGGLE timmacDANCE timmacWIGGLE timmacWIGGLE
[4:12:23] TheTitanic: @gerkins860 just longer training and by the right people. i thnk it can be recovered but change needed
[4:12:23] killogic916: Stop parroting what K, Ramee, others say IN CHRACTER. They obviously are biased to what they say in game

[4:13:19] 0rder613: 2 people got it right but the ones that got it right guessed
[4:13:22] ExessiveGK: the whole judge thing erked me, they said no judges available but A judge could come to to argue contempt idk
[4:13:26] ironman5506: Taking up for Ruth
[4:13:27] Lordbidwell: Lol
[4:13:27] MarkusC12: I was right!!
[4:13:36] Redworker11: i was listening only
[4:13:36] WickedBTW: Im right lets go :)
[4:13:38] WTFutz: you need to tell us to be looking at the screen when you do that!
[4:13:38] zypher01: it was definitely 69
[4:13:40] papawolf70: What about 0
[4:13:48] hunter14119: Hell yeah I win

[4:13:58] tmoney7901: True
[4:14:11] krustymcdoogle: 7
[4:14:13] CasualStoner: what if im in to scat? checkmate
[4:14:14] 1pureevil: really in the end, the only thing k was arguing about was that the police let yeagor and others go after shooting and holding ramee up and only focused on himself and ramee. so to K it looks like they aren't policing
[4:14:16] VinceDiego: VinceDiego subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! weeee
[4:14:17] StreamElements: timmacHYPE timmacH Welcome back, VinceDiego! timmacHI
[4:14:22] sickbound: viewers forget they can go between pov's too, the streamer only has theirs.
[4:14:22] brewgamingtv: true but should also be able to say hey we messed up here
[4:14:23] StreamElements: timmacHI
[4:14:32] Cressiduhhhhh: They should have just blasted everyone since shots were fired :D (kidding ofcourse)
[4:14:37] Lepaca: experiment rejected, does not fit my narrative Madge LUL
[4:14:39] simplyl33: @ishepherd I think ks whole point is they can't admit they fucked up and just wanna act like it's all one sides fault brush it under the table and move on the same as before. Not learn.
[4:14:44] killogic916: @1pureevil It was 1 cop and oithers weere already leaving. The cop cant just leave the scene.
[4:14:48] kegelblitzzz: 3 x 3 with Murphy X and K being the only dead people on scene being the only ones being caught is just bad
[4:14:54] connorcrow15: this song fire

[4:14:59] Lordbidwell: Processing MrDestructoid MrDestructoid MrDestructoid MrDestructoid MrDestructoid MrDestructoid
[4:15:07] killogic916: People parrot what role players say IN CHARACTER as the truth.
[4:15:08] ExessiveGK: Ramee was being held up and escorted when the police came back, PD doesn't understand how to asses a situation imo
[4:15:11] R3dl1nes: @simplyl33 pretty much
[4:15:12] 1pureevil: @killogic916 that 1 cop pulled up and watched 3 run..
[4:15:13] br00zie: As a cop, you need to prioritize every situation. take it one at a time....
[4:15:19] doktou: So it is black and white
[4:15:22] killogic916: @1pureevil ok, he still cant leave the scene
[4:15:28] Cressiduhhhhh: @killogic916 yeah there are people the believe the gun was planted on k lmao
[4:15:33] cdinkel1: ur point is valid. then dont push stuff u dont know about.
[4:15:39] mrgreen941: That's what investigation is for tho no? And they let obvious masked crims just run away and only focus on the people down.
[4:15:42] swartz: What people dont get is, that Mr K getting done dirty opens up a lot of new possibilities to create content from, so in many ways it is positive for the content
[4:15:59] zypher01: @killogic916 Theres no reason for the cops to assume otherwise
[4:16:01] connorcrow15: ramee was being help up when they pulled up on scene
[4:16:02] TrueBlueRobot: I dont think that's the problem, why does slacks admit pd failure but ruth never does?
[4:16:03] TheTitanic: i get that, but then do some investigation work. not just ignore the ONLY dead guy and then charge him
[4:16:06] sherdon278: ramee was yelling that the suspect was in the car and on the bike though
[4:16:07] xJOKURv: what if someone on scene told the cop who shot, and guy on bike was there for 5 min and left
[4:16:09] sym_biotic: they didnt even include k and ramee's statement in the reports or warrants.
[4:16:14] sherdon278: but in the heat of the moment they didnt hear it
[4:16:15] ExessiveGK: during gangs shoot yea the did that in the past, thats the point even Moon was saying
[4:16:18] Cressiduhhhhh: @connorcrow15 naw he was pulling K out the car lmao

[4:16:22] Steelhuf: @Timmac K said he feel like the cops always want to be right in his eyes and when he was pushing them with facts they wouldn't take it. When he was pressing them with the dundee case that they blew up the tanker they wouldnt own up to it and he was getting pissed
[4:16:27] Dmany1: @swartz it also unfortunately closes a bunch too
[4:16:43] arch_dawg: PD was not set up for success in 4.0. Too few people, incomplete mechanics, not enough vets. PD is now buckling under that strain
[4:16:45] sherdon278: @SelfSecluded that was a little after
[4:16:45] mrgreen941: That's the situation I was referring to with thr goldfish brain cops.
[4:16:45] Lepaca: how could the officer that just arrived not arrest the people I saw doing shit from my streamers perspective? big Madge
[4:16:46] jack__burton: i believe most of the ppl get what you are saying.  you cannot deny the relationship between CG and the RP cops has always been bad to the point of an obvious pattern of bias
[4:16:47] bigfoot7802: Slacks has already stated they handled that situation, poorly.
[4:16:51] benr151998: it was just poor judgement on the pd side , doesn’t warrant hate on the characters and streamers
[4:16:53] mrpavelmoya: after watching Mrk recently cops see them as 10cg bringing the old mental
[4:16:54] cdinkel1: why
[4:16:57] ZaffreBlaze: And K never is convinced he’s right and doesn’t wanna back down, right?
[4:17:02] zypher01: I think its telling that the best cops have or have played crims
[4:17:03] Apollose_: What about shooting the tanker yesterday killing a dozen people.
[4:17:06] sherdon278: @bigfoot7802 in rp?
[4:17:06] br00zie: Its hard not to take shit personal in RP sometimes. Because you dont really know everyones intentions
[4:17:06] Tickls: cops never think they do anything wrong
[4:17:09] FryeDaye: bad PR to double down
[4:17:10] tinydemian: true
[4:17:17] notcurfew: You waiting for k again?
[4:17:18] RegulatorTTV: cop gang
[4:17:18] CasualStoner: as long as there are consequences and lessons learned, no faul
[4:17:20] benb0mb: Whole situation is messed up.  Just gotta rp it out and roll with it.
[4:17:21] bigfoot7802: @bigfoot7802 yes, in front of K at the prison.
[4:17:23] kegelblitzzz: Even the, all this would have never happened if they did not search victims on the ground. 3 different situations same outcome. X, K and Murphy is the same failure. pD is consistent at least
[4:17:26] zypher01: Playing Cop and Crim should be more of the norm imo
[4:17:26] Lordbidwell: Why would binny do this timmacLAUGH
[4:17:27] Crazeeeeee8: @timmac makes sense, but lots of folks gonna get guns planted in them now… rat shit is gonna be rampant
[4:17:27] killogic916: @sherdon278 yes
[4:17:34] TheTitanic: cops are a higher standard. they can take your freedom.. they can right the wrong right then and there
[4:17:35] R3dl1nes: my question is i hope when gomer finds out he beable to talk sense to Mr K to go the correct way or something b4 spilling blood end of the day
[4:17:41] j0nnyfiver: at this point with Mary and Yeager having no push back from PD the assumption should be they are CIs
[4:17:44] MasterBelial: Everyone always thinks their are right unless they are lying, then they have a vested interest in convincing you that they are right.
[4:17:50] darozay: I was fine with everything until they raided rental properties
[4:17:54] TripleJAllDay: its all gonna add to the story at the end of the day
[4:17:54] StreamElements: The thing is, you're like a brother to me, but at the end of the day, when it's all said and done, business is business, and not for nothing, it is what it is and that's that.
[4:18:00] Cressiduhhhhh: Crane gonna get a gun put on him is my bet lmao
[4:18:03] New_York_E: ramee said a judge getting a gun
[4:18:06] luis2386: also, if you missed something at first glance, it’s ok to say that was a mistake. instead of fighting to admit it. it just helps move things on easier.
[4:18:07] Steelhuf: the biggest thing there isnt a complaint system set up for cops yet so its alot to handle when people complain about cops actions
[4:18:07] papawolf70: @j0nnyfiver TRUE!!!!!!!
[4:18:08] sherdon278: true
[4:18:14] Hey_its_Mady: In the end its Vinnys fault KEKW
[4:18:16] whistleytips: 100%
[4:18:16] WalkieJVC: the mayer is a former terrorist lol
[4:18:21] cdinkel1: ur a state employee the city is ur gang not the pd
[4:18:22] Lordbidwell: Not wrong timmacTHUMB
[4:18:22] Tickls: they aint even investigating them
[4:18:24] zypher01: They instantly treated K like a criminal even though he has no priors
[4:18:26] WheresMyVodka: she was found with rpg
[4:18:27] MrFuzzyBootzz: i mean yeager posted a pic on twatter of a dead richard XD
[4:18:28] sherdon278: he already is a felon im pretty sure (yeager)
[4:18:29] pigscanflyhigh: I think its more about the experience .. I bet more people would pass the experiment now knowing the rules
[4:18:32] altoidstin1: i cant believe Vinny dun did this
[4:18:33] OssewTV: but alot of cops made new characters so shouldnt know Ks past ..
[4:18:34] Cressiduhhhhh: All of this when you could have just killed that Arrowhead guy lmao
[4:18:35] ExessiveGK: Slacks let it slip too they have been investigating K for a long while way before being gun down
[4:18:36] IgnicityTV: that council bringing up Ramee was epic lolz
[4:18:45] CasualStoner: its just lazy rp and bad decisions
[4:18:46] wutupdun: Arrive on scene,  create perimeter, detain everyone within perimeter, identify threats, interview witnesses, release all non related civs.
[4:18:49] papawolf70: Mary = Snitch... Cops don't arrest their CI
[4:18:51] mercedezcm: VIBE
[4:18:56] arch_dawg: @hey_its_mady good thing it’s Shotz day off shotzAyy shotzAyy shotzAyy shotzAyy
[4:18:57] Steelhuf: @Timmac K said that he felt they were treating him like 3.0 K not 4.0 real estate K
[4:18:58] 0rder613: In the end can we just blame vinny lol
[4:19:02] sherdon278: k's lawyer was held up by yeager just before he got to mrpd to help K
[4:19:02] schm0z: yeah i just think its wild that the council saying section k is a scam based on mr. k from 5 years ago
[4:19:14] 12_31_1996: the only reason k was mad was because he was being treated differently
[4:19:15] R3dl1nes: @ExessiveGK on the sim card thing yes but thats it
[4:19:20] anthonytanza001: @papawolf70 K snitched on Mary and Yeager and Cops didn't do a single thing.
[4:19:20] mrgreen941: @papawolf70 right if anything they seem to protect her and mosleys
[4:19:25] Cressiduhhhhh: @schm0z thats only because who ever explained it didnt do the best job
[4:19:29] ExessiveGK: @wutupdun in theory yes, In RP well lol
[4:19:31] Hey_its_Mady: That council meeting was wild like bringing up Ramee's past LUL
[4:19:32] brewgamingtv: K talked to Crane about it
[4:19:38] altoidstin1: i mean chat K has snitcched and even helped them in a case testifying for them so Mary being a CI should result the same for him
[4:19:39] brosean78: What's going to happen when they plant a gun on Ruth and the cops don't charge her
[4:19:40] betrue2urself: mehdiYEYE kebunDance mehdiYEYE
[4:19:42] xJOKURv: also was no reason the bikes ambushed them in red car as they drove by . or knew they was in car
[4:19:44] zypher01: The stuff Crane said about copy and paste was beyond dumb
[4:19:45] sherdon278: thats so much work though ngl
[4:19:48] papawolf70: @anthonytanza001  yep!
[4:19:53] XanderOptik: unfortunately they played it like irl cops - when someone calls the cops on another person the one who makes the call is usually listed as a victim on the report and the cops proceed with that in mind
[4:19:57] Laibia: I feel like it should have been a hard rule to forget the past, not just a suggestion
[4:19:58] Kdkuiper: but the mayor and dept mayor are former terrorists
[4:20:02] mrgreen941: @brosean78 can't plant a pd weapon on pd. That's the issue lol
[4:20:05] trader455: even then the other new characters shouldn't know ks past
[4:20:05] CasualStoner: Because people cant play properly in the end, skill issue
[4:20:06] j0nnyfiver: to me tho that’s kinda failed RP already
[4:20:06] Keeper24: well K was trying to be a different character than he’s been
[4:20:08] altoidstin1: suarez,aziz,den,cornwood,bones
[4:20:10] dobronxz: Even with ramee honestly, some people weren't having it with him as a lawyer cause they kept thinking of ramee as from 5 years ago
[4:20:12] sym_biotic: and the new characters seem to remember the past
[4:20:19] dhanaz: new cops against old crim always comes to this time
[4:20:20] killogic916: Some chatters have a real hard time seeing both sides of situations.
[4:20:27] brewgamingtv: should move on from 5 years ago
[4:20:28] snorrow92: @mrgreen941 you can when they go off duty
[4:20:33] IFugroo: theyll all meet under new names dont matter
[4:20:33] anthonytanza001: it's disappointing that nothing can be done
[4:20:36] sherdon278: @mrgreen941 maybe when they are offduty in civ clothes
[4:20:36] ItsJoey_E: loading skyrim
[4:20:37] drshagnastyy: The problem is there are new characters acting as if they already know people that their only interactions thus far have been as civs.
[4:20:37] ExessiveGK: I still stand by they should of char wiped, but too many streamers rely on that one char
[4:20:40] CasualStoner: Thats a rp skill issue unfortunately...some people will be better in articulating that idea
[4:20:43] H3adass_: Yet the mayor is dab
[4:20:45] mrgreen941: I agree with that. They treated him as k 3.0 he said himself.
[4:20:51] Cressiduhhhhh: All I know is Chat was wild last night and it was night to watch with it closed LOL
[4:20:56] zypher01: Hope the Boys plant a gun on Ruth and Slacks
[4:20:57] j0nnyfiver: we just need class ones and Franny back in full effect
[4:20:57] niw18: o.o
[4:20:58] TheTitanic: but how are these "new" cops remembering the old crims
[4:21:00] fergy123: No its up
[4:21:01] darozay: ppl have been getting alot of head pops in that area.. feel like the persistence thing gonna have to change
[4:21:09] schm0z: @SelfSecluded fr
[4:21:12] Kdkuiper: when the mayor and dept mayor can be former terrorists then if thats fine, then its weird they hold others things over other people
[4:21:16] Mwm1989: did it restart
[4:21:18] krustymcdoogle: lord kebun made the best of his situation in prison rp  and it’s gonna bring more rp I’m excited to watch it unfold
[4:21:19] Jessimi: TheTitanic I suppose reading a police history?

[4:21:21] zypher01: @TheTitanic ^
[4:21:24] altoidstin1: what does planting a pd gun on a pd member gonna do? @zypher01
[4:21:30] mrgreen941: Ether way you and all the cg members are fun as hell to watch. And it's just a game.
[4:21:32] arch_dawg: my issue is the council basically treating the businesses that held the city together for over a month before the election as all suspect. its a poor way to build relations
[4:21:39] brewgamingtv: K-ville was bad ass lol
[4:21:40] DocRavage: They will plant drugs on cops not guns
[4:21:41] brosean78: They poke the Dragon
[4:21:42] francewon_: literally got timed out earlier for saying what you just said
[4:21:44] darozay: persistance+all the cheap houses being occupied now gonna be a problem
[4:21:44] dobronxz: @altoidstin1 Make them have 2 LMAO
[4:21:44] Mwm1989: did it restart at 2pm
[4:21:48] zypher01: @altoidstin1 according to the case last night it will get them fired and charged
[4:21:50] GFQPR1882: catJAM
[4:21:56] ExessiveGK: @Kdkuiper Max was going to win regardless Moon was asked to come in and help out thats why he has an admin panel
[4:21:59] Chitters2004: I understand old characters finding it tricky to forget the past sometimes, what confuses me is the new characters remembering the old ones
[4:21:59] killogic916: @TheTitanic human nature, im sure many try to hive poeple clean slate but it can be hard in a heated situation
[4:22:00] CasualStoner: NExt thing will be planting murder guns on capitains and break down the whole department
[4:22:04] altoidstin1: murphy wasnt a cop
[4:22:04] wutupdun: @XanderOptik rofl yeah they got swatted
[4:22:06] Azzarill: @zypher01 they will just say thanx lol
[4:22:10] j0nnyfiver: wonder if K puts out the bat signal for Chawa and Curtis once class ones and war really takes off
[4:22:10] fergy123: @zypher01 no it wont what? they are allowed pd guns LUL
[4:22:28] Jessimi: @francewon_ Keep in mind the mods are having to keep track of a lot of chat chaos right now <3
[4:22:32] j0nnyfiver: cops are doing it too tho
[4:22:41] logicgate: Arresting K in cells was smart if he was big time crim, but in laws eyes he should be a civ at this point in the cycle.
[4:22:44] MrFuzzyBootzz: @j0nnyfiver does Curtis have prio?
[4:22:44] Cressiduhhhhh: K already talked to crane. It was just explained poorly in the meeting so no one really knew what the idea was
[4:22:46] DocRavage: All they do is give them a bunch of weed and down them by a grow op.
[4:22:50] ironman5506: I blame it all on Wrangler
[4:22:56] dadjustchillin: rooooooxane
[4:22:57] brosean78: Cops are like not in my eyes
[4:22:59] killogic916: @altoidstin1 @zypher01 ur fried
[4:22:59] CasualStoner: ITs all wranglers fault in the end
[4:23:03] darozay: yeah someone said clearly the council needs replaced with current rpers
[4:23:05] anthonytanza001: Novah!
[4:23:07] arch_dawg: @ironman5506 shotzLul shotzLul shotzLul
[4:23:09] Torrok: maybe they should treat the "council" as the cops, and dont let people with old characters be apart of it
[4:23:15] Hzero01: whats going on with that council?
[4:23:16] Civrock: Sting remix Kreygasm
[4:23:16] AkMagicz: 2 of the biggest terrorists are mayor and deputy though so
[4:23:17] Gangstajoka: even if Mr. k changed his identity I bet people will still hold  grudge on him
[4:23:17] Jessimi: Tell her 3rd eye it
[4:23:21] zypher01: @fergy123 Cops are allowed to have some other cops gun with murder on it? News to me
[4:23:23] Kdkuiper: @ExessiveGK im happy he won, im just saying its funny how people hold some past grudges about being crims but then the top two spots in the city have people who were just as bad
[4:23:27] cdinkel1: wondering how long the investigation will go on for mary until its forgotten about
[4:23:27] Alchemic_dream: Jebaited
[4:23:43] fergy123: @zypher01 why would they check the gun? its a pd gun
[4:23:46] Funami: DESKCHAN DESKCHAN
[4:23:46] DocRavage: Did he see a clip of the cops stuck in the pit?
[4:23:47] altoidstin1: @zypher01, thats a diff thing all together
[4:23:56] Funami: pepeD
[4:23:56] killogic916: @fergy123 dude is fried, dont mind him
[4:23:57] Jessimi: DocRavage Yeah lol

[4:24:01] cybigil: Yes
[4:24:02] supers3rious: yes
[4:24:06] Jansbury: yes
[4:24:07] Cressiduhhhhh: @fergy123 because the serial on it comes back to a stolen weapon
[4:24:07] BiGGHydro: Get it over with
[4:24:11] LeapingSheep: We got the money?
[4:24:13] trader455: only if u get owner ship
[4:24:19] DocRavage: @Jessimi lol that was so funny
[4:24:22] Hey_its_Mady: Hell yeah brother HYPEROOOO
[4:24:27] j0nnyfiver: Crane does the appeals and he was not happy with the Braun verdict so I think it gets handled and then that will help K but only if K doesn’t get caught up if he rampages
[4:24:30] darozay: is it even worth it?
[4:24:31] Jessimi: DocRavage Best part of the whole thing
[4:24:34] Gangstajoka: 4 k a run
[4:24:35] LeapingSheep: Lets go! grind till we can pay back
[4:24:35] trader455: if u get owner then yest other wise not worth
[4:24:36] fergy123: @SelfSecluded they wouldnt check the gun. they would just assume its their gun tho.
[4:24:36] Kdkuiper: do it before you get liquidated lol
[4:24:47] xcramxcrispy: MIGHT aswell k going to be asking for money if not lul
[4:24:55] Chitters2004: would you just split the profits according to that ratio until it's "paid off"
[4:24:59] brewgamingtv: oh i think shit is gonna get spicy today when K get's on
