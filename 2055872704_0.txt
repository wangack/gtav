[1:53:11] nthomas333: also have a lot of friends if it ever came to conflict
[1:53:12] rajadre: can always do masked up + voice changer when doing the seperate turf thing. like a secret mafia boss. could lead to good conflict if found it later on
[1:53:15] killogic916: I feel like its better for them to sell on the turf you want in the end. You can use the turf bonus when that shit unlocks
[1:53:16] masterladyfapper: Those conflict usually ends up as wars
[1:53:19] syntax_playz: But the conflict will be with vagos if random people start selling your weed on their turf
[1:53:19] slay33rr: leslie is summoned by AK

[1:53:22] slimduncan69: @anitamaxwynn0 selling weed at the apartments TriHard
[1:53:24] Sinewave: I think the conflict is fine - I think where they're getting hung up is whether you could be snitched on, cops get enough probable cause to raid the home based on the turf shit. But that's the risk you take.
[1:53:27] FasweeQ: the plan is great brings money and potential RP

[1:53:43] Hairypenguin91: Lol 4head always makes these meetings interesting
[1:53:48] NikTw1tch: wideVIBE
[1:53:48] Sinewave: syntax_playz They would be selling on a random turf, the sellers don't get to choose where to sell.
[1:53:49] DeeKoiii: I swear I've heard this convo before LMAO
[1:53:54] LluagorED: @Sinewave and when its just random people and not trusted friends etc, the risk is higher.

[1:57:27] Sinewave: As a small aside having 7 would be good to break tie-breakers if there's votes too. Since this kind of is the core 6 day to day.
[1:57:28] redjae005: ak doesn’t want it to be gg 4.0
[1:57:29] Mortal_Anomaly: To be fair, the group isn't always on at the same time. It's rare

[1:57:30] omascas: wasn't the company 7?
[1:57:32] Lcknes: Lucky7
[1:57:38] KorbenDallas815: the rule of 6 applies when not doing an active crime?
[1:57:44] slimduncan69: fanf7
[1:57:46] Itz_CIose: @bigdaddyscoot68 nah I think what AK is saying is for most conflicts and “heists” it’s only 6
[1:57:47] Grannygamma: Hazel just a pay pig
[1:57:49] RapidIQ: @Sylverphyre there's a rule of 6, who would he replace
[1:57:50] DavidCada: 6 is max for jobs I get it

[1:58:15] butspiders: make a playdate for them
[1:58:17] AtomicShoelace: @KorbenDallas815 it only applies in pvp situations but what AK is saying is they can't include him in the CORE group because in the future he won't be able to be included in rule of 6
[1:58:19] amildsatori: slayk
[1:58:23] omascas: @Hazetheking did they split for RP reasons or for a rule that applies to crime?
[1:58:24] entergaymode: truuu
[1:58:26] Cheechill: That he wants original 6 or close it seems
[1:58:26] CopperKat: holding turf is a good reason?

[6:28:16] djihtrax: mhm
[6:28:17] Layesah: mhm
[6:28:19] eeveejayy: if vinny bankrolls his own jewelry then if he negotiates for more or less than the fixed number that’s from his cut

[6:28:31] BastoderBarbar: he said he doesnt care about the money anyways
[6:28:37] Beafour: Cant you pretend to us the VU and just buy more washing machines to get an extra 5%
[6:28:42] foforo28: put the extra money that's left over after you split it equally into a pot at the end of the week. Whoever participated gets a portion of that pot.
[6:28:45] bjerre6969: isn’t it less, because of VU
[6:28:46] Spacely_Man: give him 1200 cash for 1500 roll?
[6:28:47] placeholder787: why do you not pay 600 per run?
[6:28:49] VersaceFlexGod: assuming vinny is honest with the amount hes bringing in from his runs just paying him based on jewelry rolls should be valid
