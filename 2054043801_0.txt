[1:14:40] StreamElements: Do not share in-game information regarding other players/content creators. Acie doesn't want to know and this can instead harm in-game decisions. This may result to a time out or ban without warning. (Meta-gaming is when you tell Acie what a different streamer is doing on the same server) Thank you.

[1:57:15] Bionic_Devil: pre means before
[1:57:19] genn1_: Presumption is probably pre assuming? LUL
[1:57:24] raulc_80: yes
[1:57:25] ANTiN0VA: one is pre-emptive ?
[1:57:25] PRE5TO_: the pre
[1:57:28] LilGhosteeeeee: presumption - an idea that is taken to be true, and often used as the basis for other ideas, although it is not known for certain
[1:57:29] Jetrospect: presumptuous is overstepping someone's boundaries
[1:57:32] LeBrozoJM: youre asking high level education questions rn
[1:57:33] Thomas_5970: A presumption is something you think is true before you know any facts about the matter. An assumption is something you think is true when you miss information, but you think you have it.
[1:57:36] Thomas_5970: google ftw
[1:57:37] ExcessFC: truth vs not
[1:57:37] Karmas_Weapon: presumption is making an assumption based on some info maybe?
[1:57:40] jas3y: Presumption is the acceptance of something as true although it is not known for certain. Assumption is a thing that is accepted as true or as certain to happen, without proof. says google
[1:57:44] Jasper7000: THEY ARE SYNONYMS Kreygasm
[1:57:47] MALiiBU__: no, one has an ass
[1:57:51] Bionic_Devil: an idea that is taken to be true, and often used as the basis for other ideas, although it is not known for certain.

[1:58:13] Freppuchino: @Flashthatuuu real
[1:58:14] RevillianGG: acieWIGGLE
[1:58:14] genn1_: @Flashthatuuu the real answer
[1:58:15] AlexNattes: lol
[1:58:16] Schleten_: Flash is right
[1:58:20] Levitax: When you're trying to decide which word to use, think about the level of certainty involved and whether it's a guess with no proof (an assumption) or a guess with reasonable evidence (a presumption)
[1:58:24] Puppet502: "presume" implies more confidence or evidence backed reasoning.
[1:58:33] LilGhosteeeeee: an assumtion is just something not based on any facts
[1:58:36] LeBrozoJM: lol
[1:58:36] 2wicked001: fake news
[1:58:37] hottt_coco_: they both mean ‚Äú to take something as true‚Äù but to presume implies more evidence
[1:58:38] Jasper7000: synonnymsssss aciePEACE
[1:58:40] Bionic_Devil: as¬∑sump¬∑tion /…ôÀàs…ôm(p)SH(…ô)n/ noun 1. a thing that is accepted as true or as certain to happen, without proof.
[1:58:41] LilGhosteeeeee: yes yes
[1:58:41] LeBrozoJM: wtf is happening
[1:58:42] 1iwill: right
[1:58:47] airpierre98: mhm
[1:58:48] Klarisy: presume means you have proof and assumption is like youre just assuming
[1:58:50] KimJongKite: presume = you are guessing it's true, assume = you are sure it's true
[1:58:50] twitch_Turd_Boy: Presumption is to read a book by the cover. An assumption is having read the first book guessing what the second book will be like.

[1:59:09] LilGhosteeeeee: @KimJongKite this is not right
[1:59:10] MALiiBU__: you're a smarty pants so yes you probably presume more things than assume
[1:59:11] Schleten_: But as Flash said.. Assumption has ass in it.. So it's more important Kappa
[1:59:11] Karmas_Weapon: question is was that a presumption or assumption?

[8:07:02] ribs010: @Nmplol Jason we miss u
[8:07:05] khanoute: @AltaSee I think after Nunu got caught during the chopping, Raia and Alex got some good RP together, was nice to see.

[8:11:07] mrgamer0909: @CRlCK tag me in coach
[8:11:13] topmiddle: oh thats cool

[8:14:25] Takoda2044: I LuvHearts  Acie
[8:14:29] AltaSee: Who do you guys want added to the gang? Patar cracks me up, but his access to so many groups (and their houses) makes him seem a bit sketchy.
[8:14:32] Saburbss: I think its hilarious when vee runs with her arms down like that
[8:14:32] jas3y: wasnt nick sayin he wants to do 10 hours g6 next couple days lol
[8:15:01] Exphus: clay got the streameritis

[8:15:52] mrgamer0909: well looks like no work for me tomorrow
[8:15:55] AltaSee: Jason and Raia went friend hunting yesterday. It...wasn't very successful lol
[8:15:55] shadair23: cant have too many allies
[8:15:58] topmiddle: it just needs one unlock
[8:16:02] Muffinsrevil00: second house needed for crime stuff
[8:16:02] mavericks312: adding ppl to civ gang that doesn‚Äôt mesh would kill things
[8:16:07] willowompoo: it should be extended but it needs to be people that yall connect with
[8:16:09] HandofOdd: At least 1 more gorl
[8:16:10] Rokuach: Jason and Raia tried to find new friends yesterday
[8:16:11] jbt445: I think he‚Äôs in deep with other groups
[8:16:15] Tenivir: Yuno is one of those foot in every house person
[8:16:16] raulc_80: need 2 more people
[8:16:18] justCoopp: have u ever asked patar? @acie
[8:16:18] pilfingerr: why isnt Clay Live? tell him to milk that shit
[8:16:19] martinobayern12: he is all over the place
[8:16:26] ande_rer1: progress in what? there is nothing right now
[8:16:26] h0lk1: not to much to do now other than rp and grind money
[8:16:27] bluff1n: civ gang needs some fall guys lmao
[8:16:28] topmiddle: Juju over soon anyways PepeLaugh
[8:16:29] mk46s: yuno is a cat he is on everyone house
[8:16:31] M0hkofantti: Yuno is basement dweller in many houses
[8:16:31] willowompoo: yuno is for the streets
[8:16:33] LaCucaracha7: raia asked jason about adding chloe yesterday
[8:16:34] khanoute: Yuno won't join officially because he's part of multiple groups BUT he will always help Civ Gang because of Raia
[8:16:38] VALUES__: @rokuach and then Patar ran over their new friend
[8:16:38] simmeringteapot: yuno has connections with the company, union and civ gang. i dont think he can hunker dowqn in one place
[8:16:39] Gdude460: Bring back Jay Que KEKW
[8:16:40] Dang622: What about Jay Que he's a great fit for the house
[8:16:42] proleteric: You need like another affiliated house who do weed and stuff, for crim operations
[8:16:43] VALUES__: OMEGALUL
[8:17:05] topmiddle: hide them
[8:17:07] topmiddle: for scuffs
[8:17:08] khanoute: Raia is vouching for Chloe, she'd be a nice addition to the crim side of Civ Gang
[8:17:10] AltaSee: @gdude460 lol. I feel you. I liked him in the group too
[8:17:16] raulc_80: EZ bags
[8:17:26] azh314: befriending another gang would be better than adding people to the house
[8:17:31] vel3no_: this week has been slow cause of the house scuff and and some of you being busy /having  issues
[8:17:36] khanoute: Patar has been pushing to join but dunno if he still wants to
[8:17:37] andrefvm: pick up the bags
[8:17:40] draxler077: chloe would be a great addition Pog
[8:17:40] topmiddle: Carti got the bag too PepeLaugh
[8:17:47] raulc_80: KEKW
[8:17:56] NeverOr3: 4Ton  Food
[8:18:06] y0whateverdude: sup cuh
[8:18:06] khanoute: Patar does call Raia daily and is acting very friendly so maybe he's still interested
[8:18:09] azh314: i dont think patar and yuno can be tied down to just one gang
[8:18:18] AltaSee: @khanoute he may not want to anymore. He keeps mentioning how he feels like he's being used by the group.
[8:18:25] invisuz: AAAA
[8:18:35] willowompoo: patar is the best addition so far cause he's knows everyone in the gang and he got power
[8:18:41] Hulse: @draxler077 if she lowers he mic maybe, shes so loud
[8:18:47] yourguyzuds: Nick ditching IRL friends to play GTA is based and Gigachad
[8:18:48] khanoute: @AltaSee That makes sense, I can see why he thinks that.
[8:19:10] khanoute: At the end of the day, Jason and Raia wanted Patar to "prove himself" before allowing him to join
[8:19:32] topmiddle: COGGERS time
[8:19:32] Gamertrigg: can we get into the house yet?
[8:19:32] StreamElements: Gamertrigg, no

[8:20:11] Clodhoppr: I feel like I haven‚Äôt seen the house in a couple weeks, anyone got a clip of the placeV
[8:20:13] topmiddle: Sure he is off

[8:20:58] AltaSee: How about that Ammori chick? She's friendly with Clay and Vee
[8:21:06] Dano_Leza: as Raia would say NO!
[8:21:07] momzzyy: PepeLaugh whos donating chat?
[8:21:15] justCoopp: we don‚Äôt owe u anything there was no agreement !
[8:21:18] Rokuach: Ammori Flirt

[8:21:27] Clodhoppr: what‚Äôs been going on? anyone wanna give a tldr?

[8:22:06] salmonbreedr: that's wild
[8:22:09] altlymoron: YEP does not care
[8:22:20] khanoute: Ultimately, it's down to Jason and Raia to accept new members, they call the shots so Ammori needs to meet them

[8:22:34] Marilyn_1020: back then it was so good
[8:22:37] AltaSee: @khanoute Definitely. That's a problem I see with the group. They can be so scatter brained sometimes. It would be nice if they had more group sessions to talk about bigger things like adding more ppl and stuff.
[8:22:39] topmiddle: you wouldnt be civ
[8:22:39] dontcallmebymyname89: she is thinking about her next coffee LUL

[8:23:38] RAVE_CS2: how much money does vee have right now.
[8:23:39] khanoute: @AltaSee Genuinely think a mandatory "daily meeting" would solve a lot of issues. They really struggle to communicate at times, people are being kept out of the loop which leads to problems.
[8:23:53] topmiddle: EZ
[8:23:54] FRAlex010: raia is thinking of adding Chloe
[8:24:03] simmeringteapot: borrow money from jason and buy a car

[8:24:32] topmiddle: the city is gonna get wild soon
[8:24:59] Exphus: today felt more like a sunday than a monday
[8:25:17] AltaSee: @khanoute 100% You see it with members of the group being (unintentionally) kept out of the loop of big happenings for days at a time. Or the group deciding on something major without first talking to everyone. I think it's getting better though
[8:25:20] Marilyn_1020: chat does civ gang know about what happened to the company?
[8:25:34] topmiddle: really?

[8:27:52] woodleaguelad: @AltaSee civ gang seems like people that met in game and have just become IRL friends and now just hang to have fun with eachother in Los Santos rather than delve deep into the RP of the server, that's what I like about watching lol
[8:27:54] topmiddle: is it true that x joins the civ gang tomorrow according script?
[8:28:00] AquaBerryBackFist: @AltaSee dima raided him yesterday and clay today
[8:28:03] LazyMarius: @azh314 Raia did

[8:28:34] azh314: @LazyMarius oh, thats cool
[8:28:45] willowompoo: @topmiddle nah him and jason planned this all from the beginning and theyll form the JP gang
[8:28:54] khanoute: @AltaSee Yeah it's definitely improved recently, mostly thanks to Clay. Raia and Eugene are trying to keep everyone informed about whatever happened to them aswell since they often do their own stuff.
[8:28:57] FRAlex010: of_the_wolf

[8:30:11] jerrybear_: rick rime ?
[8:30:28] kloft203: the real character is grimes but in here he is grinds
[8:30:31] woodleaguelad: @AltaSee Does anyone have aspirations outside of Eugene?
[8:30:32] topmiddle: Sure chat not overanalyzing

[8:35:39] willowompoo: JP x JP nmpL
[8:35:43] AltaSee: @woodleaguelad that's a good question. Most of the things the characters have wanted have been superficial (larger house, faster cars). It's not like other gangs where their goal is more ephemeral (like being the most powerful group in the city). I hope we get more defined aspirations as their rp evolves.
[8:35:48] topmiddle: YEP joyriding
[8:35:57] Dano_Leza: JPJP acieHEART noraexL

[8:37:02] khanoute: @AltaSee Yeah I still remember how Clay almost got kicked out early on. He pissed off Jason so much. Glad they changed their mind, he's been a formidable addition to the group. Him and Raia are hilarious.
[8:37:05] topmiddle: Sure kinda
[8:37:08] OmegaTooYew: nonnah3Dance Û†ÄÄ
[8:37:12] KissMyAceM8: civ gang YEP
[8:37:17] azh314: Only Jason is civ at this point
[8:37:19] AlexNattes: Time for you guys to do an event
[8:37:21] nonnahshannon: DinoDance
[8:37:23] connnor_24: hi
[8:37:24] topmiddle: he is bored af
[8:37:26] Crowz7: Yes
[8:37:33] topmiddle: i get him
[8:37:34] Crowz7: They need to buff crime
[8:37:34] mavericks312: problem is crim isn‚Äôt worth atm
[8:37:40] Tenivir: he sa ys a lot of th ings though
[8:37:40] willowompoo: crim is either too tedious or just standing in the middle of nowhere now
[8:37:43] proleteric: Everything will be about coins soon. You gonna need to up the coin production.
[8:37:48] khanoute: Raia and Jason are the only ones with a clear goal I feel. Alex too maybe but now he can't join the PD so...
[8:37:51] connnor_24: hiya acie
[8:37:51] AltaSee: True. It's the nature of the beast. Yall are mostly civilians, with different jobs, and wants.
[8:38:01] Crowz7: You need more racks and more GPUs
[8:38:02] Dysotopia: his head is at Top Golf
[8:38:04] topmiddle: at least the devs listened w the g6 stuff
[8:38:06] Crowz7: Coins are everything soon
[8:38:07] idfiatok42069: they need to buff robbing g6
[8:38:10] AlexNattes: Raia wants a candy store
[8:38:13] AquaBerryBackFist: np thinks this is 2.0 and early 3.0 where everyone wasn't cooked
[8:38:13] topmiddle: a huge new house i guess
[8:38:19] khanoute: Raia wants to open a candy store.
[8:38:22] AquaBerryBackFist: the progression is too slow
[8:38:34] mavericks312: @khanoute not really neither have an end game goal
[8:38:37] azh314: Mansion in winewood EZ
[8:38:45] khanoute: Jason wants to be rich and powerful so that he can shit on poorer people nmpRich
[8:38:48] topmiddle: i like the uk slang so much
[8:38:57] topmiddle: HUH
[8:39:04] Tenivir: khanoute more money isnt really a goal though
[8:39:16] Pixzl: yes
[8:39:17] Kangaroo_Balls: Jason dreaming about golfing
[8:39:21] topmiddle: yes
[8:39:23] topmiddle: bri ish
[8:39:26] Exphus: they need to make other jobs worth it
[8:39:35] topmiddle: unless
[8:39:41] Exphus: the godfather of the server
[8:39:49] abdoss: he just needs to let other poeople do the crim stuff ez
[8:39:49] mavericks312: civ gang is never gonna be ‚Äúpowerful‚Äù like other gangs
[8:39:51] goodenhi: the connections are what make you power, anyone can run g6 and get rich
[8:39:52] Tenivir: aint no civ gonna be powerful, if a civ has a ton of money he is just a target
[8:40:04] topmiddle: you can be civ and have crim friends
[8:40:04] vazeline__: Nick doesn‚Äôt know what he wants, he‚Äôs just complaining.
[8:40:07] texasniper13: Ty for the ARP Acie!!
[8:40:07] enlighten_me92: The best at crim leaves is sheet clean
[8:40:09] Dano_Leza: Elon musk isn‚Äôt a criminal and he‚Äôs powerful haha
[8:40:10] Dango4: jason golfin
[8:40:18] justCoopp: that was Eli right?
[8:40:36] topmiddle: YEP
[8:40:37] StreamElements: YEP COCK
[8:40:41] topmiddle: steal food
[8:40:43] AlexNattes: do the jump do the jump
[8:40:43] AltaSee: That's the thing. I feel like there will come a point where Jason has to become a full on crim in order to achieve his goal of ridiculous wealth. Crime will eventually pay off big, and the gang will be left behind if they don't follow the money.
[8:40:50] VaeelL: civ is just boring if you goal is to avoid any conflict or mindgame your experience will be flat
[8:41:00] mavericks312: I think the overall problem is NPnis just needle dripping content
[8:41:06] topmiddle: i mean its like 2 hours max if you get caught
[8:41:10] RodKage: Raia didn't get caught LUL
[8:41:20] M0hkofantti: You jump in? how you get out?
[8:41:20] khanoute: Do the Raia's prison jump ladydimaWicked
[8:41:23] topmiddle: they dont care
[8:41:40] spartymarty: hope prison doesnt have dogs
[8:41:40] topmiddle: they dont even have a warden, sorry
[8:41:42] khanoute: Eli is desperate to do that prison jump since he heard Raia did it, he keeps calling her to do it lol

[8:46:38] topmiddle: cant be healthy
[8:46:56] HandofOdd: You must've been out of the game for a bit to still be sore
[8:47:00] RaphaelCraZyFive: Wooow working out.
[8:47:09] LilGhosteeeeee: i be working 12 hour shifts with 4-5 hours sleep constantly
[8:47:10] MALiiBU__: I strive for 6 hours minimum, 7 likely and 8 preferred
[8:47:11] AltaSee: The different wants of each member in the group are good for rp tho. It will lead to tension in the future, as members pull the gang in directions not wanted by every member. Imagine a power struggle for the head of the group.
[8:47:14] topmiddle: you deserve it tho
[8:47:17] topmiddle: i would too
[8:47:26] CRlCK: honestly the stream keeps me awake with 1 hour of sleep
[8:47:27] MALiiBU__: My body shows bad signs when I go consecutive days with little rest
[8:47:31] scrouch144: PepeLaugh
[8:47:41] topmiddle: and only stream w grinder npcs?

[8:48:05] topmiddle: all good
[8:48:11] MALiiBU__: Could be bc her friends are on at that time @justcoopp
[8:48:29] scrouch144: how does it feel not doing 8 hours of sanitation every day?
[8:48:33] topmiddle: can we fuck the house up again today?
[8:48:33] StreamElements: topmiddle, no
[8:48:40] AlexNattes: how would have thought you will be the one that grinds the most
[8:48:41] Tenivir: i started working out earlier in the day lately, feels good

[8:50:11] topmiddle: EZ  money
[8:50:29] khanoute: @AltaSee Ngl, even though it's great that Civ Gang is such a tight knit group, would love some conflicts between members eventually, that's the best part of RP. Not sure it's going to happen anytime soon though.
[8:50:33] mavericks312: why would they move if the house is fixed
[8:50:40] topmiddle: COGGERS its time

[10:08:58] thatdudedave20: Maybe just physically
[10:08:58] 1iwill: it's very easy to fuck over someone you love if you are self centered. which a lot of us are

[10:09:07] HoldMyGrenade: she has clay
[10:09:08] anisbrio: High school is different, but in real life, man can not be friends with the women, always the man wnt a girlfriend or something else.

[10:12:37] DreamsPeek: ppl who make this claim about not being friends never acknowledge the timeline upon which friendship can exist and can stop existing.

[10:15:21] InfiniteLimitX: I think there is a line you cant cross and its different for every person
[10:15:23] DreamsPeek: But you don't just love kids no matter what people love their own kids they love their own kids to different amounts not everybody loves all of their kids regardless of anything they do. It's maybe an ideal to live too but or a feeling of unlimitedness
[10:15:24] cutz28: we all know when the vibes change
[10:15:24] RaphaelCraZyFive: I wouldnt hold it against them but i'd prefer not to date a killer. Shows low self control

[10:15:36] vel3no_: depends who they murdered
[10:15:37] ledmap: newcastle united
[10:15:38] bluedude67: @Acie i dont think love is linear were it can disappear over someone one doing somthing
[10:15:40] entrailsz: getting a loved one murdered and then being gaslit is for sure natural selection
[10:15:42] CamCamv3: you wouldn't stop loving them but that doesnt mean you cant condemn them

[10:15:52] HandofOdd: @topman_kie12 But clearly that's not what she meant
[10:15:52] topmiddle: you started this YEP
[10:15:55] macadelic91: I love my kids unconditionally, if they committed some heinous crime, yes I'd still love them
[10:15:59] khanoute: Tolan the only grinder now ladydimaDespair
[10:16:01] cutz28: should never be forced - u both want to see each other
[10:16:05] MALiiBU__: @laazarusss not necessarily. it's their perspective
[10:16:05] immortalbat_: Just stay single and live life!!
[10:16:09] altlymoron: i love stockhom syndrome
[10:16:10] DreamsPeek: I think you had a point that it's caring in almost every definition but the extent to which the care is given depends on the context of what you're talking about as love
[10:16:11] ag_ko: @CRlCK true
[10:16:19] MistaMista: people are so down bad in life in 2024 that we are ok with murder

[10:17:23] CRlCK: do not ask chat any opinion-based questions it's illegal
[10:17:24] bluedude67: its way to subjective
[10:17:26] MALiiBU__: there's a lot of perspectives
[10:17:27] laazarusss: @MALiiBU__ my thing is we have convos about men and women loving differently and its sorta true but once you have more expericne and not with just like the worst people. we arent terribly diferent ya know

[10:17:35] ledmap: its mean what it means to the you in the present
[10:17:37] sir_philip3: It's impossible to explain concept so complex in a chat
[10:17:38] CRlCK: @pandamercc THAT'S WHAT I'M FUCKIN SAYINGGGGG
