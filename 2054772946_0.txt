[0:38:32] AndroTTV: yeah the spice itself won't kill you
[0:38:44] bobbymondays: most things have a LD50, which is Lethal dose,
[0:38:46] sighwarlock: right so unless u die from reacting to the spice from it being so spicy ur good
[0:38:47] Denohar: russel took it like a champ, you not so much
[0:38:47] McconnellRet: @Rothzay that doesnt mean spice is lethal
