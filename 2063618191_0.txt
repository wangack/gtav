They were their opinions and no calamity came from that. They found a resolution. You're dealing with people. People have feelings.

[1:03:36] BeerRun204: It should be for RP experience, if they don't own the property and can show no reason to be on a roof it should be trespassing
[1:03:44] Bluntblower_508: @wacker28 true, you're not wrong there. But ems could check their bodies if its not breaking rp or someone to do an autopsy

[1:04:33] ltl_wackman: NODDERS pikachutheferret
[1:04:35] Scottycky: you dont have to submit it to the case
[1:04:41] outlawpickle: its still worthwhile to collect evidence and log, police need to stop failing to do their jobs based on a hypothetical judge's ruling

[3:44:52] Usahi_Light: Oh I was confused from thaat whole Mr. K thing but its been a while
[3:44:57] reydedark: didnt they say somthing about it in a meeting
[3:44:59] SarahFlare: him being part of the scene gives you that correct? bc you don’t know if he’s a victim or a suspect
[3:44:59] ManakinEU: i wonder how that works irl if someone gets hospitalized witha bunch of drugs on them for example
[3:45:04] sevenevilmuffins: wouldnt being a suspect in a stabbing case instantly give you probable cause
[3:45:05] imSteffin: PC = Probable Cause
[3:45:05] tenaja22: yeah hes allowed to have it, and you did ask him to search him, and he consented.
[3:45:10] The_YARRsonist: Should carry a 2nd gun to plant on crims
[3:45:11] RietArtwork: probable cause is he was on the scene, i think
[3:45:17] OutKast2: mhm TakingNotes will this be on the test tommorow?
[3:45:19] imSteffin: Frisk does not equal Search.

[3:45:23] itrainmma: nooooo
[3:45:25] Usahi_Light: oh so its frisk, serch if weapon, then everything else is clear
[3:45:36] Maz0hyst: @imSteffin No PC is computer like Starforge WeirdDude
[3:45:39] Thraxton1: @EsfandTV I think you havce some things wrong though, If you frisk for weapons and the have a bulge, you ca only look for weapons, you cant look at other stuff, only the weapon
[3:45:45] jjmortris: Did you see the clip where cops caused a shootout because of an acorn? It was the most Cornwood IRL thing that I've seen LUL
[3:45:47] n0oxaskek: @ManakinEU hospital staff will call police and they come, wait for medical procedure to finish and arrest you
[3:45:56] imSteffin: Frisk = a search for bulges or obvious weapons. Search = Searching inventory.
[3:46:04] 키티야옹: akiwooYipee
[3:46:07] Ancor_: i think other cops use frisk as only searching for weapons nothing else
[3:46:07] IaMSiNN3r: So a bulge discovered during a frisk is probable cause?
