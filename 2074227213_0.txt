[2:38:30] blakdahlia: did the pd or state start off with any money in the account as a base start?
[2:38:54] natikar: Hmm, thats a point.  If the treasurers role isnt to pass legislation surely their default position should be to should abstain or vote with the mayor unless it impacts funding negtatively?

[2:41:11] nikolegrnd: nikkisHm
[2:41:34] Chritters: Sometimes characters are the byproduct of their environment. Etta has been hunted previously due to her decisions on the council. She just brought that up to Jenny.
[2:42:08] Naphtax: tbf, that's what juno tried to do right?
[2:42:25] ImMcGuirk: @Chritters no, youre wrong mod Im a chatter therefore i am right

[2:42:59] wesfeye: McGuirk really asked to get bonked
[2:43:12] blakdahlia: always leave a paper trail
[2:43:35] machaparfait: i think she confuses business finance situation with state finances/budget; like all vehicle purchases went back into the state budget, after they delegate the fund into PD/EMS, basically recycling the budget to make the economy works.

[2:49:59] Kyle_txt: thats pretty tame for him
[2:50:07] JohnieP: What was funny about the meeting was everyone was focused on Max and just ignored Michael. He's like a fly on the wall that no one thinks about. Lol

[3:14:46] Jeloume5: Why would 8 separate people have the exact same opinions on everything?
[3:15:09] sauslol: Basically "the mayor should have no power at all" is what she wants.
[3:15:22] minnmor: @sauslol no?
[3:15:23] erinord: I mean...if it's chosen by the mayor, that's what they're going to want
[3:15:23] ragorez: the system was mayor and dep mayor were supposed to be an opposition, but look who got elected
[3:15:24] Rhizwynd: Whats the point of winning election if CoS didn't answer to the Mayor?
[3:15:38] sauslol: The mayor was voted in by the people.
[3:15:49] MrSpiny: The Mayor was voted by the city cathieNotes
[3:16:06] Jeloume5: So she thinks the mayor doesn't deserve anything for winning the election, he shoud just be another member
[3:16:17] Professor_Fartsparkles: "everybody"
[3:16:31] Bakipum: Yeah that's definitely an ''everybody'' lol
[3:16:55] mangi: what policy does everyone hate tho?

[3:17:47] Symbiontey: nikkisCozy
[3:18:10] DanOMyte79: she needs training Jenny
[3:18:17] Professor_Fartsparkles: It seems to me that the only people getting upset about that policy are the people that want to have like 10 adopted siblings or kids.

[3:21:23] MacabreOS: i think they uped it to 3
[3:21:24] Jeloume5: Etta should have been for the adoption policy cuz that would give the state more funds
[3:21:27] ragorez: and married couples share it
[3:21:35] wesfeye: has it been confirmed its that way?
[3:21:40] minnmor: i dont like the "you cant even say this to be your kid or you are going to be fined"
[3:21:41] Rhizwynd: Etta seems part of a vocal minority
[3:21:53] Shockwave_005: Agree.  Cap should have been higher.  More kids = more income for the city/state.
