[2:48:26] Nooms162: @MissinMyTeeth that'd be pretty powerful and i think result in them not being around the server anymore.
[2:48:26] Hey_its_Mady: Uchi's barrel is stuck behind the washer

[2:55:14] JetfireZB: @BlacKnight2514 thats basically what it is
[2:55:44] x_Gordo: thats smart
[2:55:48] cybigil: Move the mattress for the recording studio.  Maybe you can fall through the  mattress
[2:55:49] BlacKnight2514: @JetfireZB but an actual door with a differnt key to open that scret door that elads to the drop down that they have now
[2:55:49] Thewildth1ng: ya I like that idea
[2:56:10] BreezyBri: put a bait computer desk over the dropm down hole
[2:56:17] ItsEdBoi_: 2nd bench would be good for Vinny too
[2:56:20] JetfireZB: @BlacKnight2514 yea only thing is you can do keys that are sperate like that, i think in the future maybe with more security things
[2:56:29] ItsEdBoi_: could set up a shitty computer too
[2:56:37] Kdkuiper: yes
[2:56:38] iTzMeegra: lol finally some old fashion GTA conflict

[3:01:57] zypher01: theyll probably add warehouses again no?
[3:02:03] Gatorade_Me_Bish: @b_goodhue thats probably the move
[3:02:29] x_Gordo: that house next door should be full of washers since no one uses it
[3:02:30] ItsEdBoi_: yea really just need to put the master pc in new house, everything else is just money, pc is time based
[3:02:30] JetfireZB: @zypher01 doubt it cause houses are bassically warehouses now

[3:02:43] CMF_LOONEYTOON: timmacWAVE timmacWAVE timmacWAVE
[3:02:49] Galacticowboy: it's a good idea and it's a pit
[3:02:50] Chitters2004: i like that idea
[3:02:53] modals0l: amount of people moving in and out will be an issue too
[3:02:53] notwowayzz: cg can‚Äôt keep secrets
[3:02:54] b_goodhue: Only 1 key
[3:02:55] Lavitzboss: kind of like the breaking bad mobile meth lab inside the pest spray houses
[3:03:07] ItsEdBoi_: yea last season breaking bad
[3:03:07] ohhhyunjin: @adwyer4 I think he‚Äôs just decorating
[3:03:13] hunter1319: and it‚Äôs always on the move so it won‚Äôt get burned easily
[3:03:13] irishmf_24: Storage units be sweet
[3:03:17] JetfireZB: and then when that one is done you rent it and move the stuff again
[3:03:18] BlacKnight2514: CG has to many members with the knowledge of everything
[3:03:18] iTzMeegra: you need a an OG only house
[3:03:20] Lavitzboss: yea with the pest spray houses in Breaking bad
[3:03:21] yoshiebandit: It's a really good idea
[3:03:24] Jayl0cked: kinda like the late stages of walter white and jessie's Meth op where they were fumigating properties and setting up in each house
[3:03:27] ChiefKeif: has anyone tried to use a lock pick on a house door yet?
[3:03:27] Galacticowboy: the problem is investors might show up
[3:03:27] Kdkuiper: def should have washers in there rn
[3:03:29] BlacKnight2514: need to keep it to core CG that know the important info @Timmac
[3:03:34] BreezyBri: you know theres grinders just putting up a wall around their computers when they go to bed
[3:03:35] Chitters2004: store the key in a vehicle in the garage or something
[3:03:35] sharpsprocket: You just need a safe house that you use only for important stuff. That only a few have access too
[3:03:38] Th3Sm0GG: a good idea would be a stash house with one key that you always have stored somewhere
[3:03:49] ItsZen__: do people have keys for the house next door already?
[3:03:52] JetfireZB: just only 2-3 keys
[3:03:52] Lavitzboss: its just a numbers game

[3:04:07] adwyer4: i like that
[3:04:07] BlacKnight2514: to many people have keys to this house imo @Timmac
[3:04:09] outsideinsiders: did somebody steal a key from a CG member? or is this just precaution?
[3:04:10] indielm: having just 1 key makes it so much safer
[3:04:10] meat2missle: need tenants to keep moving it forward
[3:04:14] Rigz007: timmacSMART
[3:04:20] ItsEdBoi_: u should check if car in garage can hold key in the glovebox keep ur junker parked with the key
[3:04:23] b_goodhue: Yep never have the key on ya unless u going there
[3:04:26] pdelectric: You might have to draw a cartoon like rosea does to hold thier attention
[3:04:28] ClassifiedGnar: how full is the rack :O
[3:04:33] UrClassicDerp: couldn‚Äôt you just put a key in the garage next to the house and do it that way @timmac
[3:04:33] Blue_Walsh: I think Gomer still has furniture access at the cops' house. Could stash stuff there KEKW
[3:04:35] xspoofx: What's TLD? was it the company?
[3:04:41] ItsLowk: outside of Vinny, Ramee and K...Gomer is pretty much gonna get the intel over most everyone else
[3:04:44] Gatorade_Me_Bish: Having 12 keys out there is huge liability, really just a matter of time before you have to change the locks
[3:04:45] crispy1421: timmacKAPPA
[3:04:51] Lavitzboss: the top floor needs to have the end finished off lol
[3:04:58] cybigil: I think CG should save up and get another house that is only used for the computers and crafting.  Not the hang out house.
[3:05:02] meat2missle: need to change from red. it screams ‚Äúhey over here‚Äù
[3:05:03] StreamElements: timmacHI
[3:05:03] ItsHecate: feel like having the house under a low key member would be better too

[3:05:36] vapegod420bruh: chaddNasty chaddNasty
[3:05:37] notjakobi: how much crypto is mining
[3:05:42] Lavitzboss: I swear the trap door is going to work
[3:05:51] zaf_playz: You guys need to move the top floor a bit down because it's going out from the wall
[3:05:53] Lavitzboss: people just run through doors fast with no regard
[3:05:54] 500togo: is that gpu rack speeding up the buttcoin mining?
[3:06:02] crispy1421: timmacTAG timmacP timmacR timmacRC timmacDR
[3:06:03] ItsJoey_E: you see the drone app
[3:06:06] chewiegummiebears: How much electricity are you using?
[3:06:07] Th3Sm0GG: if you put rugs all over the 2nd floor, no one should be able to pick up that spot
[3:06:08] kingoftheorphans: Does the rack take a lot of power?
[3:06:11] x_Gordo: @500togo they need the other app for it to start mining
[3:06:19] zaf_playz: so if you do it a little bit down, that will hide under the ground maybe.
[3:06:21] Lavitzboss: If anyone breaks in they are going in the trap room 100%
[3:06:23] RagRanger: make a gaming house
[3:06:31] irishmf_24: Keep collecting the butcoin aswell so they can get the next app  for more butcoin
[3:06:35] awwDrats: dont forget the girls are taller lmao
[3:06:35] Gatorade_Me_Bish: How much coin does the rack generate?
[3:06:39] zaf_playz: tell k about this maybe
[3:06:39] BlacKnight2514: the design and flooring of this house needs alot work tbh, shit is still scuffed @Timmac
[3:06:44] b_goodhue: I wonder if u had a door to the basement and change that lock so like only 1 key opens it
[3:06:51] ItsEdBoi_: could prob make 4 floors tbh
[3:07:06] Lavitzboss: carmella set the height with a female wearing heels, thats why its spaced that way
[3:07:12] JetfireZB: is it possible to add a door and change the lock for only that door
[3:07:13] Blue_Walsh: You can fix the shit sticking out with the create room option. Carmella didn't figure that out until the rental property
[3:07:14] Lavitzboss: because they are the tallest people
[3:07:34] x_Gordo: yea bait bench far away from the hole
[3:07:38] b_goodhue: Put a couch right in front of it but still be able to walk behind it
[3:07:41] BreezyBri: cant you just put plants all around the drop down hole?
[3:07:42] TheCarnifex: ConcernDoge
[3:07:46] titanvol29: Need to block the hole so you can't see its there
[3:07:49] notjakobi: carpets on the wals with boxes hidden behind them on the second floor
[3:07:49] drewdeezy21: I wonder if carpets even exist
[3:07:52] Lavitzboss: Carmella tried the create room thing with the top floor, but it doesn't seem to work
[3:07:59] Gatorade_Me_Bish: Just a build a wall around the valuable shit and delete it when you need to access it 4Head
[3:08:00] crispy1421: kebunO7 rameeHappy_TK timmacTAG timmacTAG timmacTAG
[3:08:07] Lavitzboss: you have 2 beach towels that work in your stash
[3:08:13] Lavitzboss: that work
[3:08:14] modals0l: what about a false wall
[3:08:25] x_Gordo: @Gatorade_Me_Bish thats some grinder activity LUL
[3:08:26] bittybanks333: they should flip the stuff inside the studio Aaron‚Äôs so the light isn‚Äôt shining at the hole y‚Äôall jump down
[3:08:31] BlacKnight2514: also why that yellow of all colors for the walls KEKW
[3:08:34] titanvol29: Is the rack hooked up yet?
[3:08:34] bittybanks333: around *
[3:08:42] Gangstajoka: try a mattress maybe it would work for now
[3:08:44] ikky___: Removing the red light so it doesn't glow up the drop down might be the play
[3:08:49] chefschwan: yeah i don‚Äôt think anyone was listening to her when she said you can use towels

[3:28:21] Lavitzboss: what if you put a bathroom set beside the towel, it will look part of the set?
[3:28:26] modals0l: hide in plain sight with misc items

[3:29:51] vapegod420bruh: This beat is sick
[3:29:58] cybigil: Put the towel on a random wall far away from the access as bait.
[3:29:59] ikky___: U could 2 tone the carpet. Have the outline in the towel and the middle the actual carpet so it looks kinda like a design. I think K will cook some stuff up
[3:30:28] ItsEdBoi_: people are gonna know about the towels cant really disguise them unless u do the entire room and only u know the specific spot
[3:30:29] ChiefKeif: Ooo a rug for the stairs, that‚Äôs cool
[3:30:36] Cplkoolaid: what about a curtain layed down flat
[3:31:04] zypher01: just gotta try all the fabric objects and see which can be walked through
[3:31:12] ItsZen__: fake towel pit is actually genius
[3:31:13] Nutthouze_Penguin: I mean its already tricky to get down, so just put up a bathroom with a couple towels hanging to block it, even if they try to walk through chances are they might not know how to get down
[3:31:30] Lavitzboss: you could buy fabric and the utool right? if you type fabric in the list what pops up?
[3:31:41] modals0l: will making it clip with the hole just make it work?
[3:31:46] b_goodhue: It just sucks that anytime u get robbed there is a chance someone cut your key without knowing it at all
[3:31:54] Lavitzboss: what can fabric make? cause thats buyable at utool
[3:31:56] x_Gordo: well you can cover the floor in white rug then cover the hole with towel
[3:31:57] notdigink: I think on the walls
[3:32:02] notdigink: not floor
[3:32:03] ItsEdBoi_: yea look for fabric items, dont think rugs even exist yet
[3:32:03] zypher01: maybe not all
[3:32:14] ItlsWhatItIs: block the corner of and make a bathroom with a towl in the corner with the secret entrance lol
[3:32:21] BlacKnight2514: why not a secret door leading to the drop down that is blended in with a wall you put all the way around on the second floor @Timmac
[3:32:24] ikky___: Good question. What is fabric for. Anything in this menu need it?
[3:32:28] thylootgoblin: just put towels all around the border of the room lol
[3:32:28] zypher01: is there a difference between wall carpet and floor carpet?
[3:33:00] zypher01: Paintings could work too
[3:33:16] ItsEdBoi_: this isnt minecraft....
[3:33:21] zypher01: gotta be some kind of wall deco you can walk through
[3:33:31] ItsJoey_E: towwel looks to be the only thing to walk through
[3:33:33] zypher01: floor decos seem unlikely
[3:33:45] notjakobi: a bathroom with a towel would the be least suspect

[3:34:26] BillsMafiaSTF: @zypher01 Theres sliding doors that can blend in with the walls somewhere in the catalog

[3:34:48] modals0l: are there sliding doors that can be used
[3:35:05] DocRavage: if you put a wall across that section then add some furniture to break the los to it but still give enough room to make it there might work?

[3:37:10] ItsZen__: ming was talking about doors that lay down acting like hatches to k but you have to hit them with a rock to work
[3:37:17] modals0l: @zypher01 pass through waterfall would be kinda cool
[3:37:19] ItlsWhatItIs: the boys should make a bathroom and put the door in the shower like casino heist LOL
[3:37:21] Wyczolek: Damn later put it in houses that were rented to scam them for deposit money

[4:32:17] 3xevilx: 4k mini LED looks slightly over sat but i much prefer this than to before
[4:32:24] Furyform: There are moments where the back of the truck shifts between black and super-dark-gray
[4:32:29] indielm: the blacks not crushed like it was in 3.0, you can still see detail in the back of the truck
[4:32:32] Furyform: but that's kinda twitch imo
[4:32:42] Tzepe: put money in bank?

[4:44:31] kitkatmollywhop: you think there could be a system where they eventually make it so you can rent out your truck and it be worth it?
[4:45:46] kitkatmollywhop: Maybe put a deposit down for possible repairs, and the owner of the truck gets a cut of the run
[4:46:15] wytechocolate650: huh

[8:44:16] Tokens210: same way a tablet does lol
[8:44:21] 3xevilx: comes with pre-applied termites LUL
[8:44:25] BladedBuzzer: maybe its warping to humidity
[8:44:26] OinkerNOR: probably so people can't grind and hoard.
[8:44:38] Lemonsquezzy: im on productionrp and they make bottle water expire in a day lol
[8:44:44] Birnieee_: @Lemonsquezzy in real life it gets mouldy and a deteriorates and you can't really use it for building because when you screw into it it just goes straight through
[8:44:49] illusivespartan: This is a city that consumes all things
[8:45:14] Lemonsquezzy: apparently lol
[8:46:00] Birnieee_: @Lemonsquezzy if you leave a plastic bottle of water in the sun and then you drink the water it might still be safe to drink but it does taste like plastic

[8:47:04] WhoNeedsBullets: i wonder if they will end up making rules involving the house invasion stuff K is doing timmacLAUGH
[8:47:21] WhoNeedsBullets: i can see it being pretty destructive in the long run
[8:47:44] Mantelrorelsen: Key-jumping robberies to clean out entire houses
[8:47:50] OinkerNOR: any word on whether the devs are working on a voice fix for indoors? lolipop could hear you guys from the house next door.
[8:47:52] Birnieee_: @WhoNeedsBullets 100% they have to add laws and legislation
[8:48:11] itsAyeBaby: any picks for this week football playoff games?
[8:48:15] Wyczolek: Standing in open with Keys in pockets when no one is around
[8:48:24] Lemonsquezzy: I guess its the same question on how you fit 15 bottles of water on your person lol
[8:48:28] WhoNeedsBullets: @WhoNeedsBullets i'm talking about server rules. not just in game "laws"
[8:48:32] Galacticowboy: Susge

[8:49:23] Birnieee_: @WhoNeedsBullets I don't really think they  need to take it to OCC because it's all in game
[8:49:39] Lordbidwell: I'm just glad it isn't the silly Philly or Dallas cow girls.  So I'm happy
[8:50:02] WhoNeedsBullets: @WhoNeedsBullets not necessarily. someone could "force" another player to add them to the panel and they could completely clean out a house
[8:50:27] WhoNeedsBullets: benches, floors, everything
[8:50:40] Civrock: "Update: the issue has been resolved and the Steam Beta for our next update will be going live tomorrow morning." (this was yesterday evening)
[8:51:00] Civrock: So it should be sometime today.
[8:51:07] Civrock: Nothing on SteamDB yet.
[8:51:23] Null_Value: It was just meh
[8:51:30] Birnieee_: @WhoNeedsBullets wouldn't that just be power gaming you could definitely deal with that situation in character it's not like we're playing Rust here
[8:51:37] NauseousNik: @WhoNeedsBullets Can you tho. Because you arent allowed to do that with bank acc etc
[8:51:40] Civrock: I might start a new save with this update, so many changes since launch.
[8:52:03] WhoNeedsBullets: @WhoNeedsBullets thats what i'm saying, unless its in the server rules, someone will eventually do it
[8:52:04] malanQ: need more window frames on the top floor
[8:52:07] Lordbidwell: !org
[8:52:07] Fossabot: Join our Star Citizen organization at https://robertsspaceindustries.com/orgs/INFE - Discord: https://discord.gg/5FbmFcC
[8:52:23] IMW_Survivor: they prob added more loading screens KEKW
[8:53:14] illegitemi: why are the windows fucked up ?
[8:53:30] Birnieee_: @WhoNeedsBullets even if you can clean a house out you have to organize trucks there's weight limits in game to do this type of thing if there's a six-man group that can do that
[8:53:37] Hey_its_Mady: Could ask your neighbours for some wood Kappa

[8:54:48] redneckninja111: I got to ng+10 and stopped playing I'll go back to Starfield eventually but not for awhile
[8:54:48] NauseousNik: @Birnieee_ There is no way thats allowed. ill bet my left ass cheek. You arent allowed to force access to garages or banks. Houses would be no diff. That would be insane
[8:54:55] EriginalE: yeah some houses lok better inside than others
[8:54:59] Birnieee_: @WhoNeedsBullets I think it will be dealt with when it does happen in game I don't think you have to take OOC
[8:55:17] Caanon565: Once you guys have farmed a lot of buttcoin, you should have 1 main hard drive wallet stored in apartment barrel.
[8:55:50] EriginalE: yup
[8:55:59] Lordbidwell: 100$
[8:56:07] Lordbidwell: 100%*

[8:56:14] StreamElements: Gomer Colton | NoPixel 4.0 | !phynix | Socials: @timmac
[8:56:44] Birnieee_: do any other role play servers have anything like this?
[8:56:47] NauseousNik: People are building tactically defensive houses with decoy storage and hidden objects. So silly in RP
[8:57:15] BowSlinger77: You should be able to set up booby traps in the house. Like a shotgun trip wire
[8:57:23] jaggedbowl420: like once a week but coin transfer
[8:57:49] Galacticowboy: wilhelm scream
[8:57:51] Lepaca: wont matter how much you hide shit, people will dora every inch
[8:57:51] jaggedbowl420: cuz it now costs but to send but
[8:57:53] MrBossYellow: How much do you think the richest person has?
[8:57:54] 420nAss: i wonder if the pits gonna actually work xD
[8:57:58] EriginalE: anyone with a brain will look through all levels
[8:58:04] Birnieee_: @NauseousNik I agreebut hiding a basement floor does happen when the PD raids a house
[8:58:09] Mantelrorelsen: Place a door with a different lockin the hole with a doorframe?
[8:58:11] xl__8s: what about you make a room you can only open through the editor like move a wall to open
[8:58:25] Lordbidwell: Yeah hopefully you can get a carpet to put over the opening
[8:58:29] Caanon565: Need to add a diagonal wall to left of door so it looks like staircase is there
[8:58:32] g33j4y: @xl__8s kinda powerful dude
[8:58:40] EriginalE: ahhh ok
[8:58:42] Birnieee_: @xl__8s powergaming
[8:58:58] NauseousNik: @Birnieee_ Ofc. These places are build like fun-houses tho. Angles that don't make no sense to have in a house
[8:59:01] mattt210: couldn't they escort their friend out from the pit tho?

[8:59:26] Mantelrorelsen: a locked trapdoor would slow them down
[8:59:38] 420nAss: vinny would be in house more often too
[8:59:43] Kxart: can you put the towel in that hole to hide it ?
[8:59:47] RyanTheeBook: 3.0 had secret bookcase doors in one building, didn't they?
[9:00:12] Azhogh: There should be a full floor coverage
[9:00:18] Tateo13: should just do a checkerboard floor of towels with holes that you get stuck in.
[9:00:19] RyanTheeBook: oh that looks cool
[9:00:21] giggles5502: I hope Vinny don't lose his connect
[9:00:21] deivdeivdeiv: multiple trap doors and 1 correct one lol
[9:00:22] Null_Value: The other home Vinny uses has a nice setup to hide their stuff.
[9:00:24] Lordbidwell: Looks nice with the bush
[9:00:32] EriginalE: i love seeing eacch houses hidden stuff
[9:00:35] g33j4y: frannys room
[9:00:45] EriginalE: thats dope
[9:00:48] Chodie: Gotta find... bush
[9:00:48] Lordbidwell: Need more bush timmacBEG
[9:00:49] NauseousNik: @RyanTheeBook There are some of those build into vanilla GTA. Story gameplay.
[9:00:50] WhoNeedsBullets: the housing system should be a keypad + key system instead of just keys tbh. then they could have a hacking thing so people get extra security
[9:00:50] Galacticowboy: chodies mom got bush
[9:00:52] 88eg: lol
[9:01:02] lordofgods10: gotta max out your weed selling
[9:01:02] wytechocolate650: where is bush
[9:01:05] Lepaca: I love the grass and bush room in my house
[9:01:10] NauseousNik: @WhoNeedsBullets Agreed
[9:01:19] Lordbidwell: Need to find the bush timmacBEG
[9:01:20] 420nAss: that looks fireeeee
[9:01:23] AlindBack: Just gotta find some hippie chick
[9:01:23] giggles5502: Should make it like behind the studio to go down
[9:01:24] Birnieee_: @NauseousNik I understand what you're saying they're making mazes instead of the houses so to correct that they have to add building inspectors into the game but if they want to cover a staircase of a mattress I don't see anything wrong with that but the police have to have a way to move the mattress
[9:01:24] Chodie: My interface looked different

[9:05:15] 420nAss: anyone tried to place stuff outside the house ?

[9:06:29] NauseousNik: @Birnieee_ Its a game with a specific purpose tho. Min-maxing as if its a pvp-base rust type game is ruining alot in my opinion
[9:07:12] emrejonson: also bottom floor roof, could be lowered till the work bench top, so you get more space on 2nd floor
[9:07:48] Lepaca: the bot welcoming itself Susge
[9:07:51] Birnieee_: @NauseousNik I can understand why it's frustrating to watch now but when the police raid the house the police raid  the house did you watch any content in 3.0 when they did a raid on a warehouse  it was W's

[9:09:34] wytechocolate650: omg
[9:09:37] NauseousNik: @Birnieee_ Warehouses is the key word there. They are ment for that type of content and didnt have customization to defy gravity and no-clip etc. I'v made my case tho. Some are gonna min-max instead of RP'ing. Thats how it is
[9:09:54] jzisawesome: what we up to
[9:10:57] jzisawesome: can you put a couch on the roof?
[9:11:05] Galacticowboy: put a deck on the roof
[9:11:07] jzisawesome: workacholics style
[9:11:22] Birnieee_: @NauseousNik there's moderators and admins on no pixel that are watching out for this type of thing it literally breaks the rule of all no pixel servers power gaming
[9:11:30] NauseousNik: Beach chair with a little shade and a table for a beer on the roof :)
[9:11:43] WhoNeedsBullets: whats the point of the room thing to begin with? it doesn't make sense
[9:12:03] Birnieee_: I think every 5m server I watch has that rule
[9:12:53] Birnieee_: @WhoNeedsBullets what do you mean by that can you expand on that?
[9:13:16] NauseousNik: @Birnieee_ and yet people do it all the time. :D   Ramee knew how many gangs and what there names were because he looked through the clothing store gang items. They act as if its a respawn if you get hurt instead of a dangerous situation. They drive while carrying people on their shoulder. Let me know when you see a pattern here

[9:20:29] Galacticowboy: mine freund

[9:22:46] xthebutchx: just add 10 more doors lol
[9:22:56] Azhogh: What if they add a light source below to blind them KEKW
[9:22:58] Lawdie123: You could do with a plant near the hole in the floor so you cant see it from the stairs area
[9:23:03] SPxTDG: surrounding it with other things with make it less of something to catch your eye
[9:23:05] jamieddd: can see k wanting to build it out lot more too. he seen how easy to rob people lol
[9:23:09] ixbxkillabee: the stairs should lead straight to the trap and you guys just dip off the side before the door
