[1:01:10] joel_alex: Lum Lord
[1:01:16] owenawesomedude: you need your ped model and can hire someone to make custom outfit
[1:01:17] BrandinArsenault: They've put restrictions on that now, in comparison to 3.0.
[1:01:26] interiorcastle: some people almost have to do it because they have peds which can only wear one outfit unless they designed more
[1:01:30] aggyp: YTSEZ
[1:01:31] baka_luffyy: one day..if you make your name in RP..people will make your own for free..like sneakers or hoodies
[1:01:38] owenawesomedude: no brand name logos
[1:01:40] sarahshah1: ya
[1:01:44] BrandinArsenault: Yes, but still restrictions. It used to be anyone could just turn something over but not anymore.
[1:01:52] interiorcastle: buddha, mr k, taco and a few others are custom designed
[1:01:55] aggyp: TISOLC
[1:02:00] IgorKrop: make your own brand in rp
[1:02:04] BrandinArsenault: Yes
[1:02:06] hhanamizuki: yeah, you could ask Leslie she had someone make April!

[1:02:10] interiorcastle: cornwood your love too lol

[1:02:52] interiorcastle: leslie wanted to get a custom character for "lil fooze" when she used a voice changer at one point haha
[1:03:01] sarahshah1: Yuno had it too in 3.0

[1:04:02] TheZAG: April needs to take Eli to get his hair done. 😆
[1:04:28] jabe3ishere: There was a custom trading card too!
[1:04:33] interiorcastle: there are a few devs who do that kind of thing. i think tobii maybe? but don't trust me on that
[1:04:43] BrandinArsenault: I would ask Nathan or Anthony to see if either of them could tell you who people normally use
[1:04:54] Jeccc_: mr k (chang) used to be a default NPC model. and dev changed it to the current coz of race issue
[1:04:59] interiorcastle: oh yeah tony's custom too
[1:05:26] interiorcastle: a little
[1:05:31] ahardman59: yea
[1:05:35] mikeee_dr: I would assume so
[1:05:37] interiorcastle: a little from column a little from column b
[1:05:39] BrandinArsenault: A little, but also if what you get designed hurts server performance/etc
[1:05:51] baka_luffyy: both I think
[1:06:09] emrhys95: Have you jean paul's flinstone car? Funniest ish ever
[1:06:12] spiritking1987: sleepy644Wise feels more like for people who been around more vs newbies ellum
[1:06:22] BrandinArsenault: That is why there is restrictions now
[1:06:32] mikeee_dr: yeah that’s the ine
[1:06:35] BrandinArsenault: And some of the groups have dev connections too, Lean Bois and Chang Gang both have devs
[1:06:35] interiorcastle: the sharkmobile
[1:06:41] wildgambit: I think everyone that has a custom PEDs that been long time RPers
[1:06:44] Fossabot: left
[1:06:50] jabe3ishere: Wait are you living in LA or just visiting ellum?
[1:06:51] owenawesomedude: just ask Blau. he could connect you. he used to be an admin
[1:06:58] interiorcastle: buddha once paid like...thousands for an outfit, but then the storyline changed so he never really got to use it
[1:07:02] emrhys95: Blau got the connects

[1:07:42] Hitijahubessy: So nice that you can stay at your friends for a long period of time
[1:07:53] M12Q: Are you going visit hafu and syk in Vegas since LA and Vegas are pretty close?
[1:07:56] emrhys95: It could be iconic so it's worth it
[1:08:03] BrandinArsenault: Correct
[1:08:09] jabe3ishere: What custom are you planning?
[1:08:23] BrandinArsenault: It's also a tax write off ;)
[1:08:43] emrhys95: Never Surrender hoodie?
[1:08:49] nearcaster: How do you feel abt that annoying girl in the new sidemen video?
[1:09:00] fishthewitch: I think they can import clothes from other servers or at least they did in 3.0

[1:12:32] puffdabby903: bee the one tall guy. there are so many short kings.
[1:12:34] cozmisc: I know custom models can be shorter, I wonder if you can make one omega tall for the self-insert lol
[1:12:39] moistmami: your height maybe??
[1:13:01] BrandinArsenault: It's based on the model
[1:13:02] TheZAG: I think so
[1:13:05] who_peterpark: old?
[1:13:06] interiorcastle: James Randall from the hips down

[1:13:20] spiritking1987: KEKW you do click alot of things you might of hit the wrong thing Lmao
[1:13:25] owenawesomedude: height needs to be custom
[1:13:32] cozmisc: I think you can add ageing to skin and you can change the body type a tiny bit but the height is the same if you're custom
[1:13:48] sunderfool: one of your base mixed characters might be old
[1:13:48] cozmisc: It's why the women are so tall, bc it's the same height + heels
[1:14:12] baka_luffyy: mybe can check later..because some characters are taller
[1:14:21] mangoobango0: People would never let eli live it down frynautLess old man legs
[1:14:30] moistmami: I've seen characters whos tiiiny, like franny for example
[1:14:32] interiorcastle: there are some bigger peds in the city like Bovice (the guy who lives in the prison...not eli)

[1:15:16] who_peterpark: he was in 3.0 not sure i saw him in 4.0
[1:15:19] interiorcastle: i think because there's no crime really in the city, it wouldn't make sense for him to hang around the prison rp'ing with himself right now
[1:15:20] cozmisc: Rae met him and beat him up the first time she got into prison, it was funny
[1:15:25] TheZAG: You could call the shoes Eli 1's or something
[1:15:26] sunderfool: i remember ray mond meeting him in 3.0
[1:15:29] baka_luffyy: he like juggernaut from xmen
[1:15:52] interiorcastle: Bovice once told yuno to put his hands in bovice's pockets....if you know what i mean monkaS
[1:15:57] Gazzzzzzzzza: would an exclusive emote be possible?
[1:16:01] interiorcastle: wait that was ray mond ^
[1:16:02] sunderfool: theres a youtube video of ray mond fighting him in prison

[1:16:17] owenawesomedude: don’t worry guys. Eli will meant him eventually without even trying
[1:16:27] who_peterpark: i remember they had lifers in prison and lang would use them as slaves to mine xD
[1:16:37] Rdaems: Just don't pick up the soap dizzyTea
[1:16:43] emc353: Bovine height on no.pixel wiki '7ft1' HAHAH
[1:16:59] Rdaems: Does he still play ?
[1:17:03] emrhys95: What's Eli's canon height?
[1:17:04] spiritking1987: Hmm prison rp was more last season
[1:17:06] cozmisc: Banned
[1:17:14] Rdaems: That dude been a lifer since 2.0 dizzyTea
[1:17:16] cozmisc: No you are if you look it up
[1:17:18] spiritking1987: spirit267MyDoggo metaing
[1:17:26] cozmisc: Literally, LITERALLY metagaming
[1:17:30] ajustus2801: is there a way that you can see how much money you lost for prison or at least to see your rap sheet
[1:17:30] Rdaems: dizzyHuh he isn't
[1:17:44] sunderfool: its only meta if you act of ooc info
[1:17:45] interiorcastle: it's fine :) it's just about using it
[1:17:47] ZekeXD: bovice chased you the first time
[1:17:47] Rdaems: The fuck is that reasoning cozmisc , aslong he deosn't use it
[1:17:51] mangoobango0: I'm so curious now vunSad I can't find anything though
[1:17:54] cozmisc: @Rdaems Clearly a joke
[1:18:04] spiritking1987: only takes one slip up spirit267MyDoggo
[1:18:12] emrhys95: It's fine to look just as long as you pretend you don't know in game
[1:18:13] IamNumone: yea Ellum is chill with the meta hes got this
[1:18:16] Rdaems: Clearly not a joke if we all confused dizzytea
[1:18:19] baka_luffyy: it not meta if you bring that information in RP
[1:18:24] IamNumone: yeaa it depends on the streamer
[1:18:28] who_peterpark: i hate meta, that's why i dont use oculus
[1:18:30] cozmisc: Some people try to avoid it so they learn organically, some people watch literally everything to catch up but separate it from the character
[1:18:30] Rdaems: not clearly a joke*
[1:18:35] interiorcastle: i didn't see you running into jubby/ricardo. how did that play out? lol
[1:18:43] chloeh7500: whats the vip?
[1:18:57] cozmisc: @Rdaems Yeah the first message was ambiguous but I clarified and you replied after that
[1:19:22] emrhys95: Have you met angryginge's character?
[1:20:00] who_peterpark: has cornwood seen your drag fit yet?
[1:20:18] cozmisc: @phobos_xoxo I think I heard doctors/EMS get some prio too? don't know how true that is though
[1:20:20] Rdaems: But u have met Bovine ? Suprised he still plays that character since he has been there since 2.0 if not the start of the server @ellum dizzyTea
[1:20:22] haIocline: love the blanket! super cute!
[1:20:28] emrhys95: Cornwood in drag gave me night terrors
[1:20:32] interiorcastle: they got prio because they wouldn't make the server lag all the way up in the prison
[1:20:32] Idriguesk: plus not everyone's on at the same time, so sometimes it's harder to bump into people
[1:20:59] Rdaems: Yh , i saw him alot on Buddhas stream alot on 2.0 when he went to prison on a daily basis dizzyLul
[1:21:23] interiorcastle: yep that's what makes it exciting
[1:21:38] cozmisc: You and April felt really natural, you didn't even hang out the first day you met just argued lol
[1:21:42] cozmisc: Eli and April I should say
[1:22:27] spiritking1987: spirit267MyDoggo you what

[1:28:32] interiorcastle: april's back story is she came to los santos because yuno stole her husband Schmedison Schmark from her

[1:30:31] interiorcastle: i think jeeves is so exaggerated it would make it hard to actually mald at him
[1:30:34] owenawesomedude: would be a major conflict of interest with the gworls anyways. they are all involved in some level of crime
