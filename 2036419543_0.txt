[7:06:04] spectre007_endplease: Maybe put the gun away
[7:06:39] timesealer623: whatre the major differences between hunting in 3.0 vs 4.0 other than the skinning/carving?
[7:06:50] ForgetMidnight: o7
[7:07:09] ForgetMidnight: D:
[7:07:10] TomGreek1980: Scuff is different
[7:07:35] leeshin28: so this is why tony doesnt get money from hunting
[7:07:49] DayJaWho: idk if this is meta but because of the scuff 1 person shoots the other skins
[7:08:00] plutr0nium: How could Earthwell do this?
[7:08:12] TomGreek1980: Earthwell sees and knows all
[7:08:57] TomGreek1980: What if you go to an area no one else is at?
[7:09:08] spectre007_endplease: Maybe get the scufflord to do hunting and everything will get fixed
[7:09:14] tenthBRETT_: did you end up getting a license? @Harry
[7:09:25] timesealer623: @spectre007_endplease he's already reported a bunch of issues, the devs are aware
[7:09:25] Hogie48: I love how dougie slumps before he relogs
[7:09:27] cole803: @DayJaWho most people have been doing one gets trails, other shoots and next skins, seems to be the only way to avoid scuff
[7:09:55] TomGreek1980: Lang needs to bless the hunting trip so there is nothing wrong.
[7:09:58] lamby478: harrWiggle harrWiggle
[7:10:32] spectre007_endplease: @timesealer623 I don't mean bug reporting. I mean if it scuffs for everyone, it should work for the scufflord
[7:11:38] cole803: @Harry so how luci does it, eve finds trails, then he shoots and she skins
[7:12:01] cole803: seems like best way to avoid scuff but it still happens
[7:12:20] cole803: @Harry Luci is always leader
[7:13:09] cole803: but seems to work either way
[7:13:26] trudgener: first time I've heard Lexi's voice in 4.0

[7:15:01] cole803: remember, even tho it sometimes works for them, theres still so much scuff
