[0:31:39] zodlez: makes sense
[0:31:40] skeeter042: @ArtByBaha  sayeedLOVE
[0:31:41] WHiTEMATH: less rep
[0:31:41] ChrisPNutssss: giving them a bulk deal
[0:31:47] mrcapo47: Eggsactly
[0:31:49] ShreddedFPS: i think it must be RNG but better payment ofc
[0:32:01] Haadro: try only having 1 bag on you maybe
[0:32:02] ArtByBaha: Pushin the kush! So e things don't change ahhah
[0:32:14] DeejaysCrib: Loool
[0:32:17] Lamparosky: more money, but more time
[0:32:19] Ssylar__: PepeLaugh
[0:32:22] Shunne93: But that's not a bug no?
[0:32:23] ytheyas: LUL
[0:32:24] chrims0n_: are you pushing harrys weed?
[0:32:25] ShreddedFPS: you need to find out the MINIMUM payment per bag at 100 rep
[0:32:31] ChrisPNutssss: it would take  ALOT longer if you sold 1 bag at a time
[0:32:34] Haadro: surely it’s intentional
[0:32:35] ChiefinIt: I think he means to test the price
[0:32:35] Babushka_82: @chrims0n_ diana/vagos
[0:32:36] decaffgluten: it's 100% an exploit LULW
[0:32:37] da5id_h: gotta have the W in the RP server
[0:32:37] banananonana: speedy are you going to do subhaton any time soon?
[0:32:37] AndreSeek: Its exploit
[0:32:43] lyfmobile: @shunne93 that's exploiting
[0:32:43] boobysmoke: one way trip to guantanamo
[0:32:57] DeejaysCrib: Nobody's know tbf
[0:33:08] ShreddedFPS: exploit about what?
[0:33:09] dadfoxrouuuda: you can try it just to know the price of one bag
[0:33:12] TropicalToucan: It's a bug it's just rgn on # of bills per bag. I'm pretty sure you are experiencing lucky times
[0:33:15] chuffingbear: its a -1 WeirdDude
[0:33:19] TropicalToucan: It isn't *
[0:33:21] Frozencurse: guantanamo looking cozy this time of year
[0:33:22] lenalenalilly: why so much to grow so little to sell
[0:33:27] Goschenk: if you add the fuel cost and the travel time between drop offs for one bag at a time I doubt it's an exploit
[0:33:32] Shunne93: In 3.0 I remember people used to keep like 2 baggies of meth because it would clean money better or smth
[0:33:34] dadfoxrouuuda: i mean dealers do have sometime only one bag left lol
[0:33:39] guilty_look: lady jigglin
[0:33:42] Shunne93: I don't think it was considered exploiting but better to not risk it
[0:33:51] ChrisPNutssss: the profit you'd make by selling 1 at a time would pay for the gas you would have to pay cuz it would take 10x longer to sell 100 bags
[0:33:54] ryuudrg: time is money
[0:34:00] ShreddedFPS: how did you get this car?
[0:34:01] sangminhtv: Go wash dishes tony
