[0:47:18] MordecaiTheBrown: if Den gets fired, is he banned from PD for that characters life? or can he reapply
[0:47:18] Koll0: The captains were contemplating on 45 days, but they all said 30 days is way too short
[0:47:19] rossetk: They said they will make it 45 until they get ways to remove them in the captains meeting
[0:47:24] brimstonegusher: crim v pd is unbalanced lol
[0:47:26] Antdavs24: for how quick they handing out daps, yea way to long
[0:47:26] Toyola: they're trying to make the PD way more serious than it used to be, but idk if its really working that well

[0:47:41] 1MILKBOY: is it 10 days per dap?
[0:47:43] SacreDiablo: do any of the captains have Daps
[0:47:45] lillukeii: is this hotel California

[0:47:57] joet1118: Imagine getting more punishment as a police then a terrorist LUL
[0:47:58] Doqx42: 60 days IRL is same as 7200 in-game prison sentence.
[0:47:58] duskinter: Do you think they should us "body cam" footage for officer complaints? Like a change, it seems now it's just the word of the civ
[0:47:58] widbar: DAPs need to go down with time on duty. Not IRL days.
[0:47:58] hollowrust: @Nataweenie shift 3 is safest i think
[0:47:59] haleyheartt: @esfandtv I’ve been wondering, why is cornwood buying the turbos with his own money? why isn’t PD buying them to test?
[0:48:07] Nataweenie: it should be like 3 weeks for 1 dap if anything
[0:48:09] Reserter1938: AINTNOWAY 30 days is too short lmfao, server hasnt even been up a full 30 days yet

[0:48:14] brimstonegusher: @SacreDiablo slacks said he was gonna self-dap yesterday but idk if he did it
[0:48:16] RexPappa: I think the whole DAP thing needs to be revised. Captains spend hours discussing on arbitrary punishment points
[0:48:18] redrum359: this chase is going on way too long wth

[5:44:10] DuelMasterYugi: he was in his peanut snr buns shirt lol
[5:44:12] KellBellnf: They didn't know for sure it was peanut, that's why they didn't go all out
[5:44:12] Mawkatz: sign on as a captain then demote the other captains. judge says its not illegal
[5:44:12] CrystalDimension: @sterred with Cornwood there was 5
[5:44:13] TheMah1337: peanut was identified wearing that
[5:44:15] ChippieChad: doesnt matter chat he got away and it was entertaining kekw
[5:44:16] 360ski: Wonder what would happen if Cornwood rolled up in a tan BCSO car zazogeOOPSIE
[5:44:17] Janizki_Fin: HOW
[5:44:19] evilmoose__: Who was the rental.owner?
[5:44:21] Janizki_Fin: he just threw it out

[5:44:25] oofinside: Susge
[5:44:25] MysticCasey: DNA expired Sadge
[5:44:26] jacksmithcje: I hate identifying bs when they all happily know to call out cornwood for being big
[5:44:26] marczm4n: whatchu mean, that’s his boy
[5:44:27] baababy: bc its ramee
[5:44:27] BenthamBestBoy: he did
[5:44:27] SkyeReaper: Ramee is ride or die lmao

[5:44:30] MahanGM: Hmmge
[5:44:30] Yidz: gloves?
[5:44:31] inducedcatharsis: Expired maybe?
[5:44:31] Hawkblack627: in his profile is a bunch of photos of peanut

[5:44:32] HeyMeghan: it will say no dna if theirs isn’t on file
[5:44:33] taraannee: if he got caught would yall even charge him with anything?
[5:44:33] Ancor_: its stuff other people randomly throw
[5:44:33] KnightyGaming: stephleeALIEN
[5:44:33] Thozel: Susge
[5:44:34] TheyCallMePoki: Scuffed the DNA
[5:44:34] EZScuderia: banger slowJAM
[5:44:35] bobbybeee: didn't you take pictures of allhis outfits?
[5:44:35] Xierany: Too long ago?
[5:44:37] joster124: you are scanning it wrong KEKW
[5:44:37] panchoxidado: the car was cuff
[5:44:37] sebastian2395: check rental papers?
[5:44:38] tieman2: do you have DNA on peanut?
[5:44:38] bjustice0387: took too long?
[5:44:39] BopSC2: did the impound scuff it?
[5:44:40] panchoxidado: scuff
[5:44:40] nabstonekido: He didn't steal it maybe
[5:44:41] BreadSlice_: Impound wiped it??
[5:44:41] ZuddyT: Hmmge
[5:44:41] Shakeboxing: They're bald @EsfandTV just like Asmon
[5:44:42] Exotic_Soul: he'll just be back to crim rp then, he wont stay a lawyer forever @EsfandTV
[5:44:43] MoohamedAlii: Machine broken
[5:44:45] possibly_ed: maybe put it in the garage and back out clears it?
[5:44:45] oofinside: Listening
[5:44:46] Rebsdorf_TFT: Ramee knows how to walk the line, he is a pro when it comes to avoiding trouble
[5:44:46] TeaPartyTickler: too late for the rental papers
[5:44:46] Creative145: Cant you just ID someone based on the sound of their voice? The fact that you can just wear a mask and seem like a completely different person only to cops is weird
[5:44:47] marczm4n: that’s nice asking if you would respond to Forrest Gump in distress
[5:44:48] nationas: good job hes not a cop or he would lose his job
[5:44:48] knowlightnofear: for RP sake...he called Mcnaulty right now just to talk hypothetically with him haha.
[5:44:48] charybdes: put it on the ground and try again
[5:44:49] john2pm: Breath id, nose id, hair id there is a bunch of ways to know it him
[5:44:49] dibadibb: McNulty literally stopped him, found out it was Ramee and let him go LMAO
[5:44:49] autorocket: I left for dinner did peanut get caught yet?
[5:44:49] HistoriesPiston: Scuffed
[5:44:49] judge_hat: he didnt pick up the rental papers
[5:44:52] DrWetbone: ramee should have been in custody for joyride using phone when directed not to and handing peanut keys
[5:44:53] Wandering_Ranger: ramee is Ramee, that's why LUL
[5:44:53] Thraxton1: The vehicle was stolen and Ramee drove it, why the fuck would you not arrest him?
[5:44:55] oofinside: Listening 󠀀
[5:44:56] goingafk0: cant you run DNA on the mask?
[5:44:56] Beep_Cx: peepoLegs Jamgie
[5:44:57] Cthyllah: are gloves a thing
[5:44:59] jeffrey778: crims get some gloves?
[5:44:59] sn3glen: maybe the impound scufffed it
[5:45:01] joster124: or maybe scuff or old
[5:45:01] singsyng: @Creative145 no, you can't use voice to ID on NoPixel
[5:45:03] RedDawnWOLV: ddidnt she say you had to drop it on the ground then pick it up
[5:45:04] Najb0lji: do you have peanuts dna?
[5:45:05] heakr: @Creative145 cant voice id as far as i know
[5:45:05] evilmoose__: @esfandtv Well he's been caught and let go before, so why would he not do it.
[5:45:06] oofinside: Wokege engine
[5:45:07] CrystalDimension: @EsfandTV put the mask on the ground and try again YEP
[5:45:07] supitsmikel: wheres the new pd car
[5:45:09] neft39157: maybe DNA got fucked because it got scuffed
[5:45:09] Sizzlaa: scale AI will take over in a few years esfandCOPS
[5:45:10] typicaluser777: What happens if you cant catch peanut and the 4 arrest warrants expire?
[5:45:11] ChiliDogLarry: @Thraxton1 they said no proof earlier
[5:45:12] HeyMeghan: if you have dna on him it will be on his profile @esfandtv
[5:45:13] rickyred66: It's actually a different mask and jersey
[5:45:14] BoldSlowbro: you would be able to prove that ramee was with Peanut
[5:45:16] skilleto19: This is why Slacks needs to be on when he is supposed to be LULW
[5:45:17] Vikairius: If impounding the other vehicle scuffs other evidence that is a huge issue
[5:45:17] aussie_herobrine: chat please go cry someone else holy shit
[5:45:19] Hawkblack627: weed?
[5:45:22] Shaphilly_: tool kit refill?
[5:45:22] Exotic_Soul: ramee doesnt care if he loses his lawyer RP pretty sure
[5:45:24] oofinside: good rule but stupid LULE
[5:45:25] SmoknBuddha2ya: @esfandtv don't forget to log that you got your engine swapped and the mileage for Ruth
[5:45:27] Kev_Prime: I feel like being able to use voice to request for more id is fine.
[5:45:27] CodeEditor: his voice is so distinct though
[5:45:28] lzrdwzrdtv: kinda dumb if they use their character's voice if u know their character.
[5:45:30] jacksmithcje: how do you catch people with warrants it just has to be random
[5:45:31] Cthyllah: yeah do you have peanuts dna on file
[5:45:32] franky47: It should be enough to have a reasonable suspicion
[5:45:33] john2pm: everyone would have toi use voicechangers
[5:45:34] DrWetbone: peanut was doing an accent
[5:45:34] Diamondman121314: yeah, I mean, you saw Max do it with Pilbis/Leon
[5:45:35] rabbyraptor: Bedge
[5:45:35] the_real_jfk: is it for people with multiple characters?
[5:45:35] skilleto19: It makes no sense because you could do that IRL 100%
[5:45:36] marczm4n: no face no case
[5:45:39] Thraxton1: @ChiliDogLarry He was driving the car hello?!
[5:45:39] MahanGM: there is never a good balance
[5:45:40] JC9R_: you definitely have pc he has been id in that outfit lots of times
[5:45:41] TheMah1337: Was ramee giving the keys to peanut while they were detained not obstruction, or tampering of evidence since the car was stolen??
[5:45:41] taraannee: @aussie_herobrine ah i forgot we can’t get into the rp & play along
[5:45:42] ggsz: @CodeEditor could be on a diff char
[5:45:49] SoIafar: i think voice ID should be a thing but have very low to no standing in court at all
[5:45:50] Zarniwooper: if your disguise is shit i think its ok
[5:45:52] Gachiguru: or just dont talk
[5:45:54] Freddiepines: people already do pepeW
[5:45:54] mizzikk2401: true
[5:45:55] heakr: @skilleto19 you thought about gta rp being a game and not irl
[5:45:55] SoIafar: so it wont have a huge impact
[5:45:56] MysticCasey: Voice is used for identification in the real world.
[5:45:58] skilleto19: PepeLaugh
[5:45:59] coldan01: they need more senior officers in shift 2
[5:45:59] ChiliDogLarry: they already do though lol
[5:46:00] Sizzlaa: iman gadzhi is a homie hachuYup
[5:46:01] Mawkatz: Do crims have to follow any rules?
[5:46:02] kineticdevice: Xqc would be screwed
[5:46:04] ens0mniac: @EsfandTV it should be grounds to at least search out the person to talk to them about what they were doing at the time
[5:46:04] HistoriesPiston: YEP
[5:46:05] Ravic0n: you can use it you just need other things to also identify them.
[5:46:05] jacksmithcje: it’s a good rule but how do you catch peanut knowingly it has to be random by that point
[5:46:05] codeoftheplayground: Definitely rather have masks than 1000 random voice changers.
[5:46:09] Dr_Stabwounds: also people have more than 1 char
[5:46:09] MisterParry: cops should be able to voice ID, but it shouldn't be evidence in court
[5:46:09] TheGhostlyOnyx: @MysticCasey 4Shrug it's gta  though
[5:46:09] OutofRightField: @Gachiguru just don't do crime at all while you're at it
[5:46:09] NonToxicant: YEP
[5:46:10] ChippieChad: he was literally in a red football jersey and sagging jeans kekw
[5:46:10] CrutonArt: a no voice changer rule would be nice
[5:46:12] supitsmikel: jp flashbacks lmao
[5:46:13] Diamondman121314: You saw Max identify Leon as Pilbis because of being the same streamer, so I can understand that
[5:46:13] rickyred66: I was watching from his pov and he was going off because they hadn't identified him
[5:46:14] onlyicxrus: @SoIafar if it has no standing then theres no point in having it
[5:46:17] eaglezFly: chat the real world has more than x amount of people that are in no pixel
[5:46:21] Gachiguru: @OutofRightField no crime no chase EZ
[5:46:24] john2pm: Line them up and make them sing Backstreet boys
[5:46:25] Kaztiell: @Mawkatz server rules yes, pd has to follow rules cause they are not crims
[5:46:25] keemotherapi: @mikel50ee voicechanger master
[5:46:26] Sizzlaa: soofloYes7
[5:46:27] eaglezFly: no voice id is good
[5:46:27] KnightyGaming: ApuJam
[5:46:28] MahanGM: no face no case EZ
[5:46:28] SkyeReaper: Are bounties allowed?
[5:46:28] Kev_Prime: Esfands Cornwood Voice Changer is the worst TBH hate it can you update your software or something ?
[5:46:30] evilmoose__: The weed you found on seen is nothing?
[5:46:31] brandontko: holy first time chatters KEKW
[5:46:32] chivvyy: its because ppl play different characters in the city
[5:46:34] arrreta: every one use same voice changer
[5:46:37] MysticCasey: @TheGhostlyOnyx GTA protocols on another level
[5:46:39] OskisOG: Havent seen Susge Archer in a while
[5:46:40] inducedcatharsis: I like no voice ID
[5:46:41] xTyyuki: was cornwood called off the chase I’m confused
[5:46:44] Xierany: Are you not allowed to use voice to recognize people? I've seen multiple people streamers do it regularly
[5:46:44] JC9R_: he should of been moved way away from the car
[5:46:45] taraannee: i mean peanut fffed himself by making himself the most easily identifiable person by wearing a peanut jersey & huge back tatttoos LUL
[5:46:45] Exotic_Soul: @EsfandTV its also because multiple streamers use same voice for multiple characters
[5:46:47] Cosmic2019: Baby Cadet
[5:46:48] TheGhostlyOnyx: can't civs voice id people?
[5:46:49] DrWetbone: I think ramee watching peanuts stream, setting up a roadblock, and telling peanut where to drive to evade is sus as heck
[5:46:50] itisacar: if voice ID was a rule you wouldn't get to play ron mexico
[5:46:51] BoldSlowbro: if you find dna on the item he thrrew out the window, you can link him with Ramee
[5:46:52] onlyicxrus: @xTyyuki yes
[5:46:53] squirtlehermit: plus malton could get two time in trouble
[5:46:55] cheezus26: cheezus26 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months! 
[5:46:55] RetPaladinBot: @EsfandTV - cheezus26 just resubbed at Tier 1 for 25 months PagChomp
[5:46:57] Cthyllah: people play so many different characters that dont necessarily all have different accents, so it would be annoying to have to have a different accent just to avoid being arrested when youre innocent.
[5:46:57] OutofRightField: @Gachiguru stack the whole server on one stop EZ
[5:47:00] aussie_herobrine: @taraannee clearly i wasnt talking to you but hey if the shoe fits where it :)
[5:47:01] doc_jade: you probably have RS to say its Peanut because he refused to take a mask off and he was with Ramee who he's known to hang around
[5:47:01] Kaztiell: as a pd you can know, it just wont hold in court as the only evidence @EsfandTV
[5:47:02] legobind: yeah but if you cant use voice to id then how do phones make  sense
[5:47:02] derpyllama420: how then?
[5:47:06] beardedcrusader18: Some of you chatters care too much lol
[5:47:09] Damnitben: @DrWetbone He wasn't watching stream dude, they were on the phone with each other lol
[5:47:12] qorzzz: BuUt VoiCe Is uSeD to iDenTifY iN rEaL LifE
[5:47:12] rickyred66: Peanut did evade he was just mad about how hard they were pitting him with no ID
[5:47:12] Mawkatz: @Kaztiell thats a shame. they should have to follow the same non-rp rules.
[5:47:14] kieranmh1995: how much is it to play on no pixel server
[5:47:16] Banchu: why was noone staying with the saniation truck in the 1st place?
[5:47:17] novat0: Not knowing for sure isn't enough to stop someone from shooting the wrong person, so should be an ok standard Kappa
[5:47:17] Cthyllah: @legobind phone numbers
[5:47:19] sterred: @taraannee H epurposefully made his character dumb, and he still cant be caught LUL
[5:47:19] oofinside: mhm
[5:47:21] taraannee: @aussie_herobrine right chat doesn’t mean chat got it
[5:47:22] Banchu: oh nvm
[5:47:23] Sizzlaa: cossack's song esfandPls
[5:47:24] enjoylife4789: @drwetbone ever heard of a cell phone
[5:47:25] jacksmithcje: problem is he knows he has a warrant so will have back up and swaps against 3 cops
[5:47:25] mizzikk2401: prob dna destroyed due to impound @EsfandTV
[5:47:26] TheEverydayAmerican: theeve12Merica theeve12Merica theeve12Merica theeve12Merica theeve12Merica theeve12Merica theeve12Merica theeve12Merica theeve12Merica theeve12Merica theeve12Merica theeve12Merica theeve12Merica theeve12Merica theeve12Merica theeve12Merica theeve12Merica theeve12Merica theeve12Merica theeve12Merica theeve12Merica theeve12Merica theeve12Merica theeve12Merica theeve12Merica theeve12Merica
[5:47:28] Antaunik: McNulty specifically said they can't go full ham because it was not a for sure ID
[5:47:28] thealiien: @kieranmh1995 youc an apply for 30 dollars
[5:47:33] Fozy15: FirstTimeChatter HOLY

[5:47:36] aussie_herobrine: @taraannee you litearlly said nothing so why would i be talking to you????????
[5:47:40] taraannee: @sterred i know he’s gonna get away with it AGAIN NotLikeThis LUL props to him
[5:47:44] Kaztiell: @Mawkatz its not a pvp game, its rp, not competative
[5:47:44] bignasty666420: esfandF esfandF esfandF
[5:47:46] ggsz: @DrWetbone timmacCRINGE
[5:47:47] singsyng: the thing I really don't understand is why Ramee was just let go on the street
[5:47:48] bignasty666420: esfandH esfandH esfandH
[5:47:50] SkyeReaper: Will you guys extend warrant?
[5:47:50] BoldSlowbro: if you find dna on the item he thrrew out the window, you can link him with Ramee  @EsfandTV
[5:47:51] bignasty666420: esfandFlick esfandFlick esfandFlick esfandFlick esfandFlick esfandFlick esfandFlick
[5:47:51] goingafk0: Ramee snitched it was him
[5:47:53] s0stin: what is the rule with masks? if he commits a crime in mask. you just arrest him for that crime and take the mask off right?
[5:47:55] RaunchyOLDwoman: Ruth said All hands on deck if Peanut is seen.
[5:47:56] TimmayHS: what da dam
[5:47:57] CrystalDimension: @EsfandTV put the mask on the ground and try again YEP
[5:47:57] bobbybeee: why isrmee with pnut anyways
[5:47:58] Sizzlaa: Wokege
[5:47:59] Fakomi: I thought voice ID was allowed but just not encouraged? A guy in graycens gang got voice ID, which led to ocean dumping and them getting banned.
[5:47:59] DezalbM: glovebox scuff is also a thing
[5:48:00] izahkiel: OOC, YOU GUYS WERE SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO CLOSE
[5:48:01] nate636478910: Hi
[5:48:02] izahkiel: SO CLOSE
[5:48:03] bignasty666420: VirtualHug VirtualHug VirtualHug
[5:48:03] Mawkatz: @Kaztiell so that means, cops should always lose and feel inferior?
[5:48:03] rabbyraptor: Wokege
[5:48:04] Pwnan: could you not cuff him and take him in for questioning
[5:48:06] JustChelsay: yeah the no voice ID is good for people that play multiple characters - people like Sykkuno who literally never changes his voice
[5:48:08] eaglezFly: @raunchyoldwoman they dont know it was peanut.
[5:48:09] DrWetbone: how could ramee tell peanut exactly where to turn as if he were seeing from his eyes if not watching stream?
[5:48:09] Wallsh_: Peanut has it easy right now in this verion of the LSPD
[5:48:09] jacksmithcje: his kidnapping warrant will be extended though for sure
[5:48:11] nate636478910: Hiiiiiiiii
[5:48:11] salveck: DNA seems to only work when picked from ground
[5:48:13] Sizzlaa: only one ping hasKomrade
[5:48:13] Thraxton1: no they were 2 on the pursuit until McNulty rejoined after letting Ramee go i thought, right?
[5:48:14] rickyred66: I watched from peanut pov. They went full hamm
[5:48:14] Pwnan: or does that break sop
[5:48:15] 360ski: Cornwood sipping on Bobby's vodka zazogeLMAO
[5:48:16] knowlightnofear: But someone like BENJI has been voice and face ID'd as the getaway driver lots of times, but for RP sake never Warranted?
[5:48:19] KappaManJason: why was ramee let go he was driving the stolen car
[5:48:21] nate636478910: Hiiiiiiiiiiiii
[5:48:23] Sizzlaa: i am leaving this SHITSHOW
[5:48:26] taraannee: how many more days til the warrants expire??
[5:48:28] ChiliDogLarry: @Kaztiell being a cop isnt an "i win" button, never has been
[5:48:29] Vikairius: Yeah, sounds like some impounding science needs to occur
[5:48:30] izahkiel: Like I can't even fathom how close you guys were to catching Peanut BibleThump
[5:48:31] sterred: @taraannee Props to his support tbf! he was directed all the way, he plays a dumb crim, hes nt making decisions just following orders. I love this RP, its so dam good
[5:48:32] Xierany: @Fakomi Exactly what I thought about too
[5:48:36] Coop914: anyone else think this whole Peanut thing is nuts?
[5:48:36] oObstsalat: unbelievable cornwood got called off @EsfandTV  :D <3
[5:48:37] eaglezFly: @knowlightnofear did he wear a mask?
[5:48:38] squirtlehermit: yea
[5:48:39] Kaztiell: @Mawkatz noone said that and its not true
[5:48:42] nate636478910: Yo
[5:48:43] eaglezFly: face is totally fine
[5:48:46] goingafk0: I honestly wish they took the risk of getting dapped and shot the wheels xD
[5:48:47] Mawkatz: @ChiliDogLarry never catching a criminal only tells the crims they can do w/e they want
[5:48:47] knowlightnofear: @eaglezFly benji normally DOESN"T have a mask
[5:48:48] Lordrune13: @taraannee he has more then one up
[5:48:58] taraannee: @sterred ik he & ramee just do sbs all the time & it’s funny af
[5:49:00] Sizzlaa: esfandL
[5:49:02] Janizki_Fin: not your car??
[5:49:04] Toastedgamer03: where are the lights
[5:49:06] eaglezFly: @knowlightnofear so he is completely fair to identify
[5:49:11] JustChelsay: @knowlightnofear yup! There was one day a cop literally shouted WEAR A MASK haha!
[5:49:19] Kaztiell: @Mawkatz maybe watch the stream, they catch crims every day
[5:49:19] Sizzlaa: Aware
[5:49:20] ChiliDogLarry: @ChiliDogLarry they never caught any criminals, not so sure aboutn that
[5:49:25] JC9R_: irl police would be much more aggro especially with a man who has multiple felony warrants
[5:49:26] Drizzle1390: Cornwood a beast carrying all those turbos
[5:49:26] ixpops: No lights?
[5:49:27] Mawkatz: @Kaztiell barely any
[5:49:28] sterred: @taraannee truey is SPICY af LUL
[5:49:32] Fozy15: Regardless of everything - I believe McNaulty went against captains orders. I remember one of them saying full send Peanut. Correct?

[5:49:38] knowlightnofear: Right, i'm just surprised they never bother with him, it MIGHT deter him (not likely)
[5:49:41] rickyred66: Esfand should watch Peanut POV when he gets a chance. PD was to aggressive with the info they had
[5:49:45] kineticdevice: No lights on that car

[5:50:14] Cthyllah: @Fozy15 the point is though they couldnt accurately identify him as peanut, so technically they couldnt full send it
[5:50:15] OutofRightField: @jc9r irl is rarely a good argument when it comes to RP
[5:50:17] oofinside: stacking LULE

[5:50:22] sterred: @taraannee thats fair... it would be a helll of a list
[5:50:24] MahanGM: but was it 4 on the map?
[5:50:24] eaglezFly: @rickyred66 PD was absolutely not too aggressive they followed SOPs it was a stolen vehicle so they need backup

[5:51:09] MahanGM: did they take him tho?
[5:51:10] Cthyllah: @Fozy15 Np. he was wearing a mask, changing his voice, etc., then he drove off.

[5:51:26] jacksmithcje: nah the kidnapping has to be extended
[5:51:29] taraannee: @sterred kinda hate that they just always let him go since he’s a lawyer that gets all the crims like peanut outta shit i feel like he’d be good as just a crim

[5:52:43] theshoover: The golden age of streaming was when Netflix released the full 1st season of "House of Cards" all at once, it went downhill from here.
[5:52:44] sterred: @EsfandTV You are more then 'pretty good' You are a POG rp'er

[5:52:59] OutofRightField: @jc9r Started watching late, but I think they were saying they didn't know 100% who it was. To them it was a stolen veh call

[5:53:57] VivaLaValle: c
[5:53:57] Mawkatz: none of the masks work?
[5:53:58] woolfdesign: Ramee's downfall from lawyer arc to crim will be hilariously good.
[5:53:59] Janizki_Fin: Weed was closest to the tunnels entrance that they mentioned
[5:54:02] lolfish_rs: @Bruggie thats ruby talking
[5:54:02] MooseMountedMage: did she say lawnmower
[5:54:04] Th3Ch0: @AngeloJulius sus
[5:54:05] Tuneshootin23: did we say lawnmower?

[5:54:06] joster124: KEKW
[5:54:11] Cthyllah: but which item did he throw ??
[5:54:12] Recon_XoX: KEKW
[5:54:14] Axcennts: I love Ruby lmao
[5:54:16] JustChelsay: i used to always watch crim POV but have been happily watching Cornwood do Cornwood things because Esfand is just super natural with it
[5:54:21] VivaLaValle: c 󠀀
[5:54:22] AlexGabi27: is his dna in data base tho?

[5:54:34] sebastian2395: f
[5:54:34] davideil: I watched Netflix when it was a disc you put into the ps3 and got 1 day dvd/Blu ray delivery and I thought *that* was great lol
[5:54:37] mizzikk2401: the impound scuffed it
[5:54:38] knowlightnofear: yeah you have to pick it up off the ground
[5:54:40] oofinside: mhm
[5:54:40] Recon_XoX: Is his DNA on record or does that matter?
[5:54:45] heakr: impound probably scuffed it
[5:54:45] alysawho: i thought if you picked it up off the ground after it was thrown it would show
[5:54:46] Janizki_Fin: Yeah thats buggy
[5:54:47] brimstonegusher: the pic LULE
[5:54:48] quentinthe5th: lol reminds me of the Dave Chappelle skit with dna
[5:54:50] kiolkjm: i think the dna scuffed when you impounded
[5:54:51] McKibbo: i thought DNA only showed if it was used or obtained by a criminal activity
[5:54:51] Ancor_: DNA is only when you throw
[5:54:52] AndHaka54: all the evidence u picked up was in the glovebox when u impounded @EsfandTV
[5:54:53] TheMah1337: imagine it had archers DNA on it
[5:54:53] alysawho: yes so the impound scuffed it
[5:54:54] Drizzle1390: bugged
[5:54:54] Th3Ch0: Burn was on as Rick Grinds last night, so stooked he is back
[5:54:55] possibly_ed: i think its cause it was put in the parking
[5:54:55] Janizki_Fin: You should maybe report that?
[5:54:57] Drewtly: 0.4
[5:54:59] Janizki_Fin: so the devs know
[5:54:59] Capn_Stew: Yeah it's only when you drop it that you get DNA
[5:55:01] ComplexPandaSinger: maybe if you store it
[5:55:02] TheBull14597: its because you dropped it now
[5:55:03] agnosticbishops: not just any scuff. shitty scuff
[5:55:07] oofinside: MadgeRightNow Andrews and Kit
[5:55:07] Croam: Is it not only guns and knifes that work atm
[5:55:07] Vikairius: Field tests incoming
[5:55:08] Rockshock: Maybe it was in the cars glovebox? And he threw it out. Isnt there something about the glovebox
[5:55:09] joster124: no it shows only when you put it down not when you pick up
[5:55:09] Toastedgamer03: @AndHaka54 actually great point
[5:55:12] sebastian2395: impound bugged it?
[5:55:12] wina080595khoirunnisa: 966002677 is world all
[5:55:16] Toastedgamer03: the impound removed the dna
[5:55:20] TeaPartyTickler: does putting it in the glovebox get rid of the DNA?
[5:55:23] CrystalDimension: I really think you have to put this on the ground first but maybe I'm wrong
[5:55:24] Xierany: I think it expires quickly, so maybe you took too long before testing?
[5:55:25] keith_2008: MadgeRightNow Andrews
[5:55:25] Janizki_Fin: oohhhhh
[5:55:27] heakr: @TheBull14597 it didnt show any dna before and they saw him throw it out the car
[5:55:28] Janizki_Fin: true
[5:55:33] joster124: maybe the impound scuffed it
[5:55:35] Capn_Stew: Oooh yeah that's scuffed
[5:55:35] DezalbM: glovebox is also known to scuff items
[5:55:38] sterred: @JustChelsay Hes got some serious RP skills, he always finds the balance between being entertaining and  accurate. Like the moment with the mountain lion the other day, he balances the RP soooooooo well. Not all streamers/characters can do that
[5:55:39] mizzikk2401: besy let others know for in the future
[5:55:40] onlyicxrus: @Xierany its not gonna expire in a couple of minutes
[5:55:40] Smypher: @EsfandTV If you can identify the suspect with a warrant, are you able to brandish a firearm with probable cause to arrest them?
[5:55:40] Janizki_Fin: @EsfandTV  might wanna report that to the devs asap so they know about it
[5:55:44] TerrierMulac99: Whos DNA should it have had?
[5:55:45] Cerulean: test it?
[5:55:46] n8dogg03: when heist start happening
[5:55:49] Ancor_: that would just be ban worthy
[5:55:49] 1CaptainRedBeard1: That would be busted.
[5:55:49] chivvyy: that would 100% be powergaming
[5:55:49] Vikairius: If glove box or impounding removes it's a huge issue
[5:55:50] Damnitben: which should be bannable
[5:55:51] zyzzzo: test it out again
[5:55:51] Capn_Stew: That sounds life powergaming if they do that.
[5:55:52] Cashel941: That's power gaming
[5:55:52] jukla12: thats power
[5:55:52] jimborat: well they don't know that do they?
[5:55:53] 360ski: Wonder if Denz will show up for work tonight at 7:21pm EST
[5:55:53] Coop914: seems like a bug to report
[5:55:54] heakr: that has to be powergaming no?
[5:55:56] Toastedgamer03: dna test is already scuffed anyway since it only works if you throw the object on the ground
[5:56:00] Prodigy46: @TerrierMulac99 mine FirstTimeChatter wideSNIFFA
[5:56:03] oofinside: can crim scuffed impound it? Thinkge
[5:56:03] shin5sato3: that's a theory worth testing
[5:56:05] JustChelsay: @sterred yup, yup and YUP
[5:56:11] Cthyllah: i mean yeah thats for sure powergaming cause thats buggy
[5:56:12] evilmoose__: @chat Who was the owner of the rental car being chased?
[5:56:13] coldan01: probably a bug tbh
[5:56:20] Fearture: @Damnitben I tend to agree, but it's hard to 1000% prove if they did unless you have an admin look through system logs
[5:56:23] TerrierMulac99: @Prodigy46 Love that, fancy going halves on it?
[5:56:24] oofinside: thats wild if they can
[5:56:33] sterred: @JustChelsay I hope he knows how good he is, and how much we appreciate him
[5:56:39] Gurch: n8dogg03 small banks might be kinda close but you already have kinda heists with the bank trucks being robbed

[5:56:44] oofinside: xdd
[5:56:46] Rockshock: slamvan
[5:56:47] squirtlehermit: I guess it kinda makes sense that you'd impound a vehicle if you did a lot of crimes in it

[6:12:28] Scottycky: he cant get fingerprinted?
[6:12:30] RYANizee: I get what he’s saying but cmon you’re officers not idiots it’s simple 😂
[6:12:31] WildWillie419: You gotta arrest him anyhow
[6:12:32] SIeeptic: Why not just convict on the easy one which will put his DNA on file.
[6:12:33] yippyip: well, once you catch him you can get the dna and confirm it

[6:13:45] Alexpcorbin: Aren’t there multiple witnesses that literally saw him throw the phone out when Archer asked for her phone back? You, Archer, and Aziz?
[6:13:45] spillatv: she can still represent him as you haven't told her about the case
[6:13:47] sterred: @EsfandTV Just put every lawyer on retainer, then he can have no representation

[6:14:18] oofinside: @Chickenplucker26 he took a week-off back on feb 1st
[6:14:19] CrystalDimension: @Thraxton1 courts here are different and they can take his DNA right after arrest
[6:14:19] ComaToasted: frustrating
[6:14:22] DaeTonator: PD retainer should have their DNA on file like the officers

[6:17:58] Alexpcorbin: You are sooo close to pinning Peanut haha can literally taste victory
[6:18:04] skilleto19: They could authorise a subpoena for Ramees Phone and if he was on the Phone with Peanut at the time of the Chase that is Game Over for him being a lawyer.
[6:18:06] laaazylemon: Ramee is a gov employee. isnt dna on file required anyway?
[6:18:07] gblair09: @spicyville there’s so many legal aids though.. they’ll be getting lawyer soon

[6:18:25] xTyyuki: they were also both on phones
[6:18:25] Afterman_: @EsfandTV could he claim "attorney-client privilege" for the car stuff, so he doesn't have to talk about it? or does the fact that a law was broken make that null?
[6:18:27] Drizzle1390: yea the fact that ramee is an accomplice with peanut when he has warrant is terrible
[6:18:28] Thraxton1: it's still PC for arrest even if he gets it thrown out in court
[6:18:30] ykreal: all this talk for just a misdemeanor
[6:18:32] EternalCoconut: Hmmge I've never seen Cashew and Peanut in a room at the same time

[6:18:49] Wallsh_: not worth
[6:18:49] TheKingOfWit: I agree with grey hair
[6:18:52] 1CaptainRedBeard1: It's going to be hilarious if this also brings down Ramee. LUL

[10:46:16] ETShrimpinator: Cornwood gotta lose weight if he's gonna hide as a vigilante

[10:46:29] BradXeno: cops are 100% intentionally made weaker in 4.0 to try and prevent the same ending

[10:46:38] The_Boz1: it feels like cops have it alot worse then crims when it comes to puinishment. daps and the paperwork related to daps are far worse to deal with compared to crims just spending some time in jail and then they get out and repeat while cops only have 10 daps before they can no longer be a cop anymore

[10:46:57] panda_snack: uh
[10:46:57] LostNomNom: Bodycams would make sense though. The whole situation with Denz, Aziz and De Rolo wouldn't be so bad

[10:47:01] Toastbane: 4.0 PD seems modeled after liberal city PDs that no one wants to work for IRL either
[10:47:04] heftylefty_prime: @EsfandTV we're ready for some crim content. Time to vent by shitlording yourself.

[10:47:32] Farfnarkle: @EsfandTV yea but isnt body cam footage NVL?
[10:47:33] Kalious78: Cornwood can't be batman, penny Lane is she already confirmed it to phiderman

[10:48:14] Gachiguru: oh there comin PepeLaugh
[10:48:14] my69thaccount: play Ali right now and do crime
[10:48:15] Krypt1ks: Daps should be used for extreme or repeat offenses
[10:48:15] WayILive: i mean i hear ya daps are just not fun punishment for cops @EsfandTV
[10:48:17] CDowg1: DAPPED
[10:48:18] TenderPantyz: DAP
[10:48:18] detergent86: I think just don’t want police to be paramilitary lol but it’s also just really hard to do like real police work within a rp gta
[10:48:18] ben_v_art: DAP handcuffs
[10:48:19] daveisavailable: tbh a vigilante may benefit the PD right now
[10:48:19] cooterxd: Does anyone know if they will continue to add more jobs and activities for people? or are they restricted by how much they could add into the game
[10:48:19] TheRaelJojo: FAX
[10:48:20] illyB84: yeah they def gotta rework the DAP system
[10:48:20] Alphawins: 3 people, have FAR too much control over the department

[10:48:24] hereforff9: the first decisive action point was good and funny, now that denzel has 9 out 10 of them, its dumb
[10:48:25] evilmoose__: @chat Can you be a serial killer in No Pixel?
[10:48:26] Haleos_x: you know ruth will DAP you if osvaldo sues you
[10:48:27] johnnycolision: @EsfandTV did DAPS exist in nopixel 3?
[10:48:28] Sweet_BabyJeebus: the constant threatening of a DAP
[10:48:30] andrefvm: 60 days for DAP is crazy
[10:48:31] iwannanuhh: The PD has removed your player agency to play cornwood for comedic value because the threat of punishment is too high
[10:48:32] The_Boz1: why is it that crims can continue to do as many as crimes as they want and only have to do jail time as long as they want and no real permanent punishment. but cops have to constantly watch what they do and if they reach a certain amount they lose their job. crazy how that works
[10:48:34] Leafyerick: @ArdentCause after 60 IRL days
[10:48:35] RavagedPistol: I think there should be a shorter cooldown at least for the DAPS
[10:48:37] RicoLoco52: no recourse to remove daps
[10:48:37] femboysthighs: DAP system needs a way to remove DAPs for consistent good police work
[10:48:38] mismagicris: DAPPED
[10:48:38] Vikairius: Lifers were great 3.0 content but that prison is to scuffed for that to even be a thing atm
[10:48:39] KDRaid: cornwood and denzel will start their own police force
[10:48:39] KYslippy: I have seen zero high fives in pd
[10:48:40] slatt5: it doesn’t work that’s the problem
[10:48:40] xnicolerose21: why doesnt PD change leadership??
[10:48:41] LostNomNom: DAPs should be able to be taken off due to good behavior
[10:48:41] HistoriesPiston: DAP is Holding pack real progression Imo
[10:48:41] SimpForBB8: @evilmoose__ yes
[10:48:43] taraannee: i feel like if u went off duty & told slacks its bc ur too scared to do ur job maybe he'd realize how bad it is? idk
[10:48:43] OneCrazyCabby: just like IRL
[10:48:44] lorreRIn: negative reinforcement
[10:48:44] endorphinist: they need to release more cop mechanics not faster cars or more guns but more ways to collect evidence
[10:48:45] Claxman2000: Cheever said today on stream she thinks the DAP system is good and it works @esfandtv
[10:48:46] Welshstig: find a way to get sheriff's office
[10:48:47] SpiceWeaseI: @johnnycolision no they had strikes and they worked much better
[10:48:48] vxcant: creates more divide Hmm
[10:48:48] Switchblade142: Its really annoying that you can literally get 5 daps all in one incident with only a cap of 10. That's too much
[10:48:49] droksid00: its too realistic kekw
[10:48:50] ArdentCause: @Leafyerick yeah I remember that part but when did he actually receive them ?
[10:48:52] DreadMoonTV: what happened to get a DAP?
[10:48:55] ImStuckInATreeDud: WutFace lack of emoticons
[10:48:55] Drizzle1390: You may just need to take a break? You have been going hard for a month almost.
[10:48:57] EternalCoconut: Hmmge It's almost like real life
[10:48:57] butlerian_jihadist: Frivolous lawsuits
[10:48:58] TheLlamaTrainer: Its really not a good system for a game. Esp with no real oversight than 3 chiefs? Who all also signed off on 60 day suspensions? So stupid
[10:48:58] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: why can’t daps be appealed that’s nutty
[10:48:59] Hitcher_TV: @esfandtv sounds like burnout my dude just take a few days u deserve it

[10:49:00] Druzey: sounds like cornwood needs a vacation
[10:49:00] evilmoose__: @simpforbb8 nice
[10:49:00] Alkemiee: DAPs are just rp....rp is just fun....so whats the issue?? /s
[10:49:01] TheyCallMePoki: DAPs are honestly stupid especially without a reward system to go along with it
[10:49:01] yaboygrumbles: Feels like the DAP system makes people hesitate more than actually change behavior and adjust accordingly
[10:49:02] Vikarious_X: Pretty sure almost everyone dislikes how restricted cops are cos of DAPs
[10:49:03] PWRslide2: need some John McClanes
[10:49:03] horsegirldotca: you need judges who will just throw that shit out
[10:49:03] Semantha: There's near no reality from the crims and too much reality for the PD
[10:49:04] Corsacs: How do the admins of the server balance RP-capability versus retaining interest?
[10:49:04] Alphawins: daps have ruined pd
[10:49:04] Mawkatz: i keep saying that
[10:49:04] Murrig: YEP
[10:49:05] GroundControl2MajorDonger: whats a dap chat
[10:49:07] puppietreats: YEP
[10:49:08] azmer1987: Daps are RP @esfandtv remember that. Yes its a real job. As long as rp is good. Daps don't matter.
[10:49:09] Jeremyohno: It's anti fun too.
[10:49:11] Lucsvm: @EsfandTV you should try ONX sometime
[10:49:11] Aynese: tbf slacks let you off the hook for shooting someone you didnt have clear vision of
[10:49:12] Murrig: they already have
[10:49:12] ben_v_art: the Risk for it is a bit one sided
[10:49:17] LostNomNom: Honestly it should be a warning first
[10:49:17] Leafyerick: @ArdentCause Maybe like three weeks ago at this point?
[10:49:17] slatt5: @claxman2000 bad faith af
[10:49:18] j_delane: Nothing more real than baseless lawsuits
[10:49:18] Andizzzle: fuck em
[10:49:18] luxxen1: You mean like Oswaldo, who uses and claims it was fine for him to be on that roof
[10:49:18] chronicbubonic: any clips of esfand opinion on graycen ban
[10:49:19] Sweet_BabyJeebus: it would be better to just lose the case in court
[10:49:19] karaskyee: but the principle!
[10:49:19] Patr0ll: Chat, what's DAP
[10:49:19] LostNomNom: Then the DAPs
[10:49:20] ImStuckInATreeDud: @GroundControl2MajorDonger Decisive Action Point
[10:49:21] i_am_jam_: if LASO opens will that still be an issue
[10:49:21] Gachiguru: make crim punishment longer YEP
[10:49:22] 8BitBucky: Did he get DAP'd again?
[10:49:23] qorzzz: PD is WAAAY too try hard right now
[10:49:23] jakqc: why does your voice sound different
[10:49:23] lallii123: cop RP is already done Ruth set the precedent to hard
[10:49:24] Alphawins: daps are not fun rp to watch or create
[10:49:24] illyB84: agreed 100%
[10:49:24] LostNomNom: If they want to do it that way
[10:49:25] Van_1912: stage a walkout and force the dap system to be changed?
[10:49:26] GlitchyGunZ: https://clips.twitch.tv/VibrantUnusualSalamanderSMOrc-zghXHiifwRyiBxOz. Chris aka officer FLOP BLESSES Jermaine’s stream
[10:49:26] Dagg17: DAPs for normal mistakes are dumb. Also, if you are a good in situations they should remove DAPs as positive reinforcement.
[10:49:27] SavageTarzan: Classic it's funny because 2 of the captains believe that DAP time should not be lowered, but the other thinks it's way too long
[10:49:28] MDM4ever1986HD: @GroundControl2MajorDonger strike point disciplinary action point
[10:49:29] KYslippy: is there an officer of month/year award?
[10:49:29] stealthy__one: it seems like its just rp, until they actual fire someone
[10:49:29] halsby: DAP system is anti RP, a slap on the wrist doesn't create content
[10:49:30] Cordysan: Feels like it's already ruined
[10:49:31] bladeezz1816: How about PAPs? Positive Action Points
[10:49:32] BradleyKalani: tell slacks to give himself 7 daps LULE
[10:49:32] puppietreats: it prevents people from actually learning and just punishes them
[10:49:32] lorreRIn: need a reward system too
[10:49:32] RedLine__05: Honest question, don't most Cops not have a lot of Daps? Seems like it's you and Den @EsfandTV
[10:49:33] Haleos_x: mhm
[10:49:33] SpiceWeaseI: @GroundControl2MajorDonger Denzel Anxiety Point
[10:49:33] chef_daddie: idk 4.0 def has to develop before dp gets good
[10:49:36] KDRaid: how many daps does cornwood have?
[10:49:36] itisacar: I'm sure they have a list of things they would DAP for ooc, but IC it feels like they're making it up on the fly
[10:49:38] femboysthighs: if there was a way to remove DAPs through good actions then itd be fine
[10:49:39] Jrey000: we all knew this was going to happend LULW
[10:49:39] realitywolfdog: 1000 %
[10:49:41] ArdentCause: @Leafyerick crazy it feels like its been 2 months already holy hell
[10:49:41] qpatriot12: Linkle?
[10:49:42] horsegirldotca: daps should be for repeat offence of something you got multiple warnings about, like if you don't stop doing whatever the thing is
[10:49:42] WildWolfX: DAPMAN
[10:49:43] hereforff9: flop and slacks were talking the other night and i didnt like the stance flop took when asked about daps
[10:49:43] KILLSPLATTER: esfandQuest
[10:49:43] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: Denzel was high rank in 3.0 now he’s a problem child bs free Denzel
[10:49:45] xnicolerose21: why dont you guys vote Ruth out @EsfandTV
[10:49:45] mitchshadow5: Daps are a punishment that extends OOC almost even
[10:49:46] azmer1987: Don't take daps ooc it isn't like that
[10:49:47] kikisocial: DAPs seem like a bad admin policy that an IRL PD would stop after one good wrongful termination lawsuit
[10:49:47] isthisthingyon: not a single cop has come out of that stairwell feeling any more enlightened than before
[10:49:47] craigith: sounds like you should take a day break and get some time away good sir
[10:49:47] fixterjake14: 100% should have been obstruction or disorderly
[10:49:47] Murrig: most daps could be replaced with a conversation
[10:49:48] Jeremyohno: Did Cornwood get a dap for that?
[10:49:49] Fozenoh: @qpatriot12 PogO
[10:49:50] endorphinist: yeah
[10:49:53] Kalious78: He 100% did, you can't just randomly shoot unidentified subjects......
[10:49:54] AnusReaktorMan: SOFT PD
[10:49:55] luxxen1: Couldnt you still charge them?
[10:49:56] Drackaine: go play ONX for 30 days,come back, get 7 DAPs, repeat KEKW
[10:49:56] meeshAKAsketh: 1 complaint from a civilian and they dap you guys its crazy
[10:49:56] GroundControl2MajorDonger: ah ok thx chat
[10:49:56] Alphawins: daps need to become equal in value to schrute bucks
[10:49:58] Switchblade142: @RedLine__05 Yes but they're on duty far more, and they literally got the majority of them in one or two incidents
[10:49:58] Welshstig: cornwood should actually shoot another totally innocent hostage Kapp
[10:49:59] EPiQ: Nobody tried to articulate that they shoudl be detained or arrested.
[10:49:59] icephrogg: i think u should play another character for couple hours to get away from cop duties clear mind
[10:49:59] TenderPantyz: yea
[10:50:01] 1Tesla1: the training is sooooo basic for a system like daps
[10:50:02] Whistlebeak: nobody wants to do the PAPERWORK when it's a shitshow
[10:50:02] CDowg1: Imagine if Crim punishment was multiple days for big crimes.
[10:50:02] f0rbin: even if they had, they'd sit in jail for 30 mins and that's it
[10:50:03] izahkiel: YEP
[10:50:03] PsychoJoker: McNulty even said he would get in trouble for cornwood shooting people cause he gave the orders
[10:50:05] Helemok: dap's seems to have already divided the PD @EsfandTV
[10:50:05] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: snowflake pd
[10:50:06] The_Boz1: the punishment for cops seems to be alot worse then punishment is for crims and
[10:50:06] Murrig: yes i ma
[10:50:08] Murrig: am
[10:50:08] coldan01: get suspended and go to ONYX
[10:50:08] ChirithyChi: just a little
[10:50:08] kiolkjm: ripley was right lol
[10:50:08] erniejohnsonjr: Pepega
[10:50:08] Haleos_x: yes :)
[10:50:08] TheGhostlyOnyx: ??????
[10:50:09] vxcant: hoping they’re going to be forgiving when it comes to 10 dap reviews
[10:50:10] omegalul_rudy: Yes :)
[10:50:10] SharkzGG_: @LittleTexas_SheriffZesty They're different characters from 3.0 to 4.0 not the same cop
[10:50:10] ImStuckInATreeDud: yes
[10:50:10] lawlkat: plus you're getting targeted for getting DAPs
[10:50:10] TenderPantyz: LULW
[10:50:11] ComradeGreetingCard: wearing a hat +1 dap
[10:50:11] crispaynoodles: That's what Cornwood was trying to tell Slacks
[10:50:11] TheGhostlyOnyx: dentt a little
[10:50:12] Orbilion: yes LUL
[10:50:13] MDM4ever1986HD: I think Denzel was shafted Ruth has it out for Denzel 100%
[10:50:13] LCK_K: @Drackaine more like play ONX get blacklisted from PD LULW
[10:50:13] arizonaowl: YEP I am
[10:50:13] Eldargrim: esfandCOPS
[10:50:14] illyB84: some of the best cops are getting the most punishment with DAPs
[10:50:14] kaizen1201: yes\
[10:50:14] EclecticMotives: Pepega
[10:50:14] Crokar: let off for shitlording a serious scene is just stupid
[10:50:16] ExpedientMiner: i am
[10:50:17] Xeno_phile: ywp
[10:50:17] kylef_: Liberal snowflake police department
[10:50:17] Murrig: a lot tbh
[10:50:18] Scarecro0w: LULE
[10:50:18] BlazeAndConfuse: I'm just confused how making multiple bomb threats isn't considered terrorism
[10:50:18] Why_is_Barb_Yelling: it diminishes faith in the system
[10:50:18] vilefates: dentt yes
[10:50:18] WayILive: and it doesnt leave room for funny cop characters, if they fear daps for their RP @EsfandTV
[10:50:19] b0brossesdad: its because people arent scared of the police there is no threat to be arrested
[10:50:19] buttcrummbs: yeah chat, are you stupid?
[10:50:19] Jrey000: My prediction is that you will go to court because of Oswaldo and that will make you quit
[10:50:19] Xeno_phile: YEP
[10:50:19] Brewer235: why dont the DAPS just fall off sooner? seems odd they dont reset like weekly or bi weekly
[10:50:20] jessielight: this is why they need reps for cops because right now you have no ability to defend yourself only take it
[10:50:22] KnightyGaming: PepegaAim
[10:50:22] HistoriesPiston: We already see officers being super hesitate during chases and in scenarios because of the repercussions of a mistake. It needs to be changed.
[10:50:23] puppietreats: YEP dumb
[10:50:23] Leafyerick: @ArdentCause That's cause of how long he's on duty for. If he was only on for like six hours it would feel different
[10:50:24] jaacccckk: Everyone except the Daptains gets nervous
[10:50:24] windstaff54: yeah but people have been getting interviewed and saying they arent nervous at all about daps, its really just you den and aziz who are freaking out
[10:50:25] bobbybeee: Cornwoodshould start a revolt
[10:50:26] PsychoJoker: exactly! McNulty said it would be on HIM
[10:50:27] Pee_aRe: I hope Dean is good he wont be back till Feb 1st
[10:50:27] TheGhostlyOnyx: OMEGALUL
[10:50:28] Sweet_BabyJeebus: just start blastin
[10:50:28] ArdentCause: A mistake sure but is it your fault absolutely not
[10:50:30] butlerian_jihadist: Hate to say it, but Slacks is a little too nice. You need a hard ass Cornwood type making decisions on what charges to assign against crims
[10:50:32] TheyCallMePoki: You should only get DAPd for serious problems. Like Andrew's getting DAPed for wearing a hat is dumb
[10:50:32] wooltrees: chain of command protects at the very least
[10:50:33] Aresj2: did you bring any of this up in the OOC meeting ? surely there should be a way to work them off
[10:50:33] melense: KKonaW liberals is the problem
[10:50:33] BoogieAnimal: I think that there is not redemption like there is no way remove the DAPs is ridiculous
[10:50:34] isomonk: start a union
[10:50:37] endorphinist: you saw adam on the roof twice but not osvaldo
[10:50:39] DonDarbster: did cornwood get a dap for for the james thing????
[10:50:39] LilJBoii: osvaldo went against multiple police orders and put himself in harm's way voluntarily
[10:50:42] TerribleToller: @EsfandTV Thoughts on maple nut ice cream?
[10:50:42] craigith: wait did you get a dap for the shooting on the roof?
[10:50:42] the_real_jfk: And slacks said to follow orders after McNulty said that
[10:50:43] TheYellaKing: waldo
[10:50:44] xxlonegunmanxx: They were told by other officers to leave several times
[10:50:44] cboys41: @windstaff54 who are they getting interviewed by?
[10:50:46] Haleos_x: if the lawsuit goes through imagine all the complaint against the *fat guy with the cowboy hat*
[10:50:46] woolfdesign: The dumbest take ever
[10:50:46] Mawkatz: Daps for trying to take a leak, and some people think your ingoring them
[10:50:47] Jimmy_Tha_Quad: without daps, cops are op
[10:50:47] Jrey000: the problem is that SBS will lead to Daps LULW
[10:50:47] mehrt: wait did cornwood actually get dapped for that situation?
[10:50:47] cytogeni: @patr0ll discipline points basically, if you do something bad you get daps that last 60 days. if you receive 10 it is an indefinite suspension
[10:50:49] KILLSPLATTER: esfandL
[10:50:50] Alphawins: daps are the reason that whole scenario got so fucked up in the first place
[10:50:50] ImStuckInATreeDud: tru
[10:50:50] KYslippy: the new recruits gonna throw the book now bc of DAPs and paperwork. Crims gonna get blitzed
[10:50:51] droksid00: whats sbs
[10:50:52] Krypt1ks: Yea they really need to make daps last ditch punishment after repeat offenses and trying a few different things
[10:50:52] Alkemiee: its just RP though............
[10:50:53] TenderPantyz: is the radio loud
[10:50:53] TheLlamaTrainer: Also dumb how if you police more it just opens you up to more DAPS. Theres no plus side to patroling more than the next officer. In fact theres negative incentive to sit and do nothing
[10:50:53] youre_kitten_meh: sps?
[10:50:53] aTsDiesel: damn did he get dapped for the shooting on the roof?
[10:50:55] MadderHatter: he was throwing cops off the roof, the only issue is maybe that you shot without 100% identifying the target, but like you said they were supposed to be the only civ there
[10:50:55] evilmoose__: @esfandtv It won't work without a union rep that its their job is to defend you guys from getting daps.
[10:50:55] emery_steele: true
[10:50:55] KappaManJason: gonna ride with someone?
[10:50:55] AztekHQ: Plus they get mad at stacking charges but they do that with DAPs
[10:50:55] devlin0221: what is SBS?
[10:50:57] nickdrawsstuff: what is sbs?
[10:50:58] Alkemiee: ??right
[10:50:58] taraannee: i get wanting to give crims good rp too, but i think sometimes u guys are too nice & let them get away with too much (obvi daps are a major prob)
[10:50:59] f0rbin: there is no sbs for ruth YEP
[10:50:59] Leafyerick: @ArdentCause He easily pulls double the hours than almost every other cop, almost triple some, even
[10:50:59] Zolothan: is there any authority you can ask for rule clarification? like out of game
[10:50:59] megaxbrain: mhm
[10:50:59] itisacar: SBS = silly bullshit
[10:50:59] LostNomNom: What's that?
[10:51:00] iwannanuhh: Crims are allowed to SBS too much and Cops cant SBS at all
[10:51:00] lolfish_rs: PAPs to remove DAPs would actually be decent no? (Positive Action Points)
[10:51:01] DismalShark: there is a place and time for sbs
[10:51:01] droksid00: scum bag shit?
[10:51:02] arizonaowl: @EsfandTV What's your favorite type of cheese?
[10:51:02] crowgoes: Daps for papework is crazy
[10:51:02] alexandrarose13: Ramen talked to slacks and slacks said ur good
[10:51:02] old_mate_brucie: Police union to appeal days
[10:51:02] chatatonic: stupid b syndrome?
[10:51:04] Murrig: sbs = silly bullshit
[10:51:04] illyB84: they're characters are just mostly SBS LUL
[10:51:05] AltarBoytoy69: smol brain syndrom
[10:51:05] LostNomNom: Oh
[10:51:05] Bromorin: sbs? dap?

[10:51:26] onthetanks: this dude is never off the job
[10:51:27] slatt5: the stress is outweighing the fun of RPing Sadge
[10:51:28] Diamondman121314: I'm not sure if this is about being sued, but I'd say don't worry about that, he has no real grounds on it

[10:51:34] ChocolateMassage: take some time off
[10:51:34] BoogieAnimal: I think that there is no redemption like there is no way remove the DAPs is ridiculous

[10:51:40] isthisthingyon: how about you run over some locals cornwood itll make you feel better
[10:51:41] LostNomNom: It's funny maybe once or twice if there's no consequence for it, but if there are then it becomes an issue for the PD RPers
[10:51:41] spiderfaced: i know how that goes
[10:51:41] Sweet_BabyJeebus: just FAX
[10:51:42] itsveng: it’s a fair rant

[10:51:55] Switchblade142: @azmer1987 I mean even still you'd at minimum get suspended indefinitely/24hrs

[10:51:58] chatatonic: so you must destroy them
[10:51:58] butlerian_jihadist: Cop by day, vigilante by Night is a good arc
[10:51:58] Jeremyohno: Yeah daps gonna ruin pd and make it boring
[10:51:59] yaboygrumbles: DAPs are why a crim can just return to a crime scene to steal car/evidence and nobody can do much. it’s baffling
[10:51:59] xxvampxx: play something else
[10:52:00] itsjustfantasy: Rant is valid.
[10:52:00] KYslippy: even rats have to get a win once in a while or they stop playing
[10:52:02] Murrig: reasonable
[10:52:03] luis_king82: you spared a lot of lives from adam and osvaldo... for me... but it was funny RP for you @EsfandTV
[10:52:03] droksid00: cornwood could always be the change he wants to see in los santos

[10:52:08] CuBanMumzy: 3.0 got out of hand with SBS and there was no fear  of PD
[10:52:08] nickdrawsstuff: @EsfandTV to be fair, the characters in charge of the PD also suck in regards to providing roleplay --- too strict --- they are great for the type of character they are, but it doesn't look nearly as fun as when Koil was in charge of PD
[10:52:08] hereforff9: and moonmoon isnt doin nothin neither i thought we'd have little texas by now
[10:52:09] official_fomaster: maybe its time to take a few days break for rp
[10:52:11] TheGhostlyOnyx: @magnets_ it ain't the grind though, it's daps being really dumb atm prevent people from doing ANYTHING as an officer
[10:52:11] LostNomNom: Probably time for a break honestly
[10:52:12] WhereTisWaldo: who got dapped?
[10:52:12] Lucsvm: everyone makes fun of cops on NP LULW

[10:52:14] Vrasubatlat: Shitshow
[10:52:16] Folterun: ocean dump the crims!
[10:52:16] Eldargrim: pd always turns into a npc local police department because of micromanaging
[10:52:16] RedLine__05: Shoulda stayed in for Mayor tbh
[10:52:16] risingmafia_: same here
[10:52:16] Scrando: los santos needs cornwood SAJ
[10:52:18] nickswiss: who daps the dappers
[10:52:19] woodyshere: cornwood leads the PD union??
[10:52:20] Leafyerick: @EsfandTV This will cheer you up https://clips.twitch.tv/SpicyAbrasiveTortoiseSSSsss-aBgHiTnvXZOshjwB
[10:52:20] mitchshadow5: Can Cornwood make a difference apart from the PD? Can you take your frustration in a character direction @EsfandTV?
[10:52:21] Xeno_phile: esfenL bones
[10:52:21] BradleyKalani: Do days you're not on shift count towards the days for your DAPs to fall off?
[10:52:23] god_awful_gamer: there should be a 3 strike rule for convicted felonies and then you go away for a long period of time. As it is the punishment isn't a deterrent at all.
[10:52:23] Wallsh_: TAKE A DAY BREAK
[10:52:23] Marthentic: its all valid frustration tho @EsfandTV
[10:52:24] gonkfan: No positive off ramp for these systems makes them feel overly punitive
[10:52:24] Murrig: ew
[10:52:25] yeti_machette: how long have you been back doing RP @esfandtv ?
[10:52:25] Mawkatz: my ears!

[10:52:28] ekleethree: why not talk ooc to the captains about the system? cause it clearly has ooc effects
[10:52:29] KILLSPLATTER: esfandLW_HF
[10:52:30] The_Original_Badman: @EsfandTV I love GTA rp but if Cornwood were real he would need days off and occasional vacation. Maybe it's time for some Palworld or something just for a few days?
[10:52:31] Shaphilly_: 100% agree, people are gonna stop wanting to play in the games current state, especially within the pd
[10:52:32] Semantha: You're the heart of this PD, without you I don't think nearly half the PD would have as much fun as they do manage to currently
[10:52:33] evilmoose__: Bonnie getting better.
[10:52:33] RexPappa: DAPs are a problem imo, the captains spend HOURS discussing how many arbitrary points to punish, its stupid a waste of time if the goal is to incentivize good behaviour
[10:52:33] PandaNomsBamboo: might as well take a day off
[10:52:35] singsyng: playing a game like this shouldn't be frustrating and stress inducing like playing PD is, it should be fun and sillly
[10:52:35] SharkzGG_: @science_envisions That was one of Geegas plans and she just started being a doctor so maybe soon Gigis therapy will be real
[10:52:35] PatL25: should ask andrews if this is how he feels when doing his job irl
[10:52:36] Diminim: most jail sentences seem to be shorter than the drive from jail back to the city
[10:52:36] Pee_aRe: when was the last time Andrews been on
[10:52:36] izahkiel: It's better to let it out than let it simmer bro. Maybe take the weekend off and chill. Get some rest esfandL
[10:52:38] ChocolateMassage: now what Pointless
[10:52:39] ben_v_art: Bonnie killed it calling that chase a bit ago
[10:52:40] KilimanjaroTV: I mean I think cop rp is the best to watch because y'all face real consequences
[10:52:40] magnets_: @TheGhostlyOnyx there's only two officers with dap issues idk what to tell you
[10:52:40] EDestruction: is cornwood going to be getting guns for Jason polam?
[10:52:40] KnightyGaming: Lane Bedge
[10:52:41] borderless_gaming: I thought you guys addressed the dap problem that on the secret ooc pd meeting
[10:52:41] f0rbin: i think esfand is like me, if he takes a break he won't come back for a long time
[10:52:42] Simplechoices: If the punishment was hard for crime. I think the idea and tactics of doing crime would be more interesting. Instead of character develpment
[10:52:42] chatatonic: the little alamo would be chill
[10:52:43] FauxReal__: Gotta get Slacks tarot-ized tonight
[10:52:44] Neekapkilla: The way Sabb explained it I don't think it's going to change. Things are going according to plan (his words)
[10:52:44] windstaff54: the pd is stricter this time for a reason, this exact line of thinking that you are going down is why pd was hated in 3.0 sad to say
[10:52:45] aTsDiesel: Chat did cornwood get dapped for the shooting on the roof? I missed the convo he just had?
[10:52:46] Jeremyohno: Yeah an ooc talk about it might work better
[10:52:46] sabsab4: I don't understand why people want to rp being a cop with al the rules and headaches you have to follow.
[10:52:51] icephrogg: just take break from cornwood for couple hours and sbs on another character to have fun
[10:52:51] noctridic: gotta hold out for sheriff cornwood
[10:52:51] jburke23: There's just too much of an imbalance and seems like PD can't have fun RP scenarios without worrying about repercussions
[10:52:52] butlerian_jihadist: Yung Dab is going to tie PD's hands even more LUL Bro was a terrorist.
[10:52:52] GoldPoints: Andrew's been busy being a real cop latel huh SAJ
[10:52:52] femboysthighs: need LASO
[10:52:53] xxvampxx: take a break :)
[10:52:54] Heezon2ya: DAPs also dont 1:1 what the punishment for them actually is, feels a bit like chargestacking the PD does on itself
[10:52:55] The_Boz1: the captains were saying how officers were captain picking
[10:52:57] SpiceWeaseI: @ekleethree none of the captains OOC think theres a problem with the system
[10:52:57] hereforff9: i also think the PD would be super boring to watch without cornwood
[10:52:57] DezalbM: crims complained endlessly in 3.0 all these rules are because of it
[10:52:58] lawlkat: @EsfandTV You either die a hero or Live long enough to see yourself become Ripley
[10:52:58] jessielight: cornwood needs to go out and have a drink
[10:52:59] iwannanuhh: I will say part of the probelm with the fatigue is that the captains arent taking any advice or addressing the issues. They will listen but they wont change
[10:53:00] RedLine__05: Cornwood is going to become a clown like Ripley Pointless
[10:53:01] keemotherapi: @hereforff9 honestly progressively more frustrating with the constant addition of new problems to deal with stacked on top of the old
[10:53:04] Diminim: @aTsDiesel no, I think he's getting sued for it
[10:53:04] shikari_dill: did I miss drama?
[10:53:04] CosmicPanda96: Idk if bonnie likes being a cop. she sounds very exhausted
[10:53:05] Eldargrim: cops get used and abused then they quit
[10:53:05] official_fomaster: Listening
[10:53:06] decentenuff: @esfandtv what's your idea on a fix for these DAPs or DAP issues ?
[10:53:06] Orbilion: need LASO ASAP
[10:53:06] LostNomNom: They had a meeting on Saturday though I think didn't they?
[10:53:06] Lyvione: Chaotic Good > Lawful Good
[10:53:09] AnusReaktorMan: @esfandtv go shitlording oj other character Pog
[10:53:10] TheLlamaTrainer: 1 Hardass chief is enough. 2 in Ruth is too much. Far too much stress and far too many DAP hand outs
[10:53:15] TheGhostlyOnyx: @TheGhostlyOnyx I've heard people say ooc in their stream they don't wanna do anything cause of daps being dumb yes it is
[10:53:16] Rivath: @shikari_dill nah just prisoner sbs
[10:53:22] keith_2008: Sadge
[10:53:23] illyB84: i think cop is the best RP rn because of all the struggles. there's things that need to be conquered
[10:53:24] shikari_dill: ah gotcha
[10:53:25] lawlkat: ya dude. blow off some steam on a shitlord.
[10:53:25] singsyng: I don't blame Andrews for not logging in lately
[10:53:26] BoogieAnimal: Cornwood off duty at a bar would be great LUL
[10:53:27] Welshstig: can the mayor do anything?
[10:53:27] sittingwind: !time

[10:53:29] Evilzanz: bonnie at roof
[10:53:30] Haleos_x: andrews probably has less stress as a real cop right now
[10:53:31] SMFTwistedSMF: Maybe a change of pace and try Onx for a bit. @EsfandTV
[10:53:31] Jrey000: @decentenuff cornwood talked to the caps and they don't see daps as a issue
[10:53:31] aTsDiesel: @Diminim thats whack as shit ok thank you very much
[10:53:33] chrisrox22: Sadge
[10:53:33] raven1022: I feel like what you said is pretty much the same thing as Denzel shiesty said on stream, That there's no communication of "hey next time don't do that again" it immediately is just "here's 6 daps" @esfandtv
[10:53:33] nickdrawsstuff: the captain characters are good for their type of character, but don't seem fun at all to work under ---- and try to treat it like a real Police Department, instead of a fun rp game
[10:53:34] s0stin: daps are dumb. just punish people according to their crime. Warnings, suspensions and firing. and if its officer v officer disputes look at the dam bodycams only for that scenario cuz thats serious shit
[10:53:35] Heezon2ya: #MCNULTY FOR CAP

[10:53:44] FatTony99: Love you Esfand <3
[10:53:45] Karter6t: @EsfandTV You should take some days and go check out Miz/Knuts gym to get away.
[10:53:46] ChocolateMassage: Ron Pog
[10:53:46] Kev_Prime: Ron Mexico
[10:53:47] xnicolerose21: DAPs are clearly affecting people OOC. and making them not want to play
[10:53:48] kratoids: just get off early and relax
[10:53:49] wooltrees: ice cream ever show up?
[10:53:51] nyawiez: what happen
[10:53:51] izahkiel: esfandL

[10:53:54] nickdrawsstuff: hop on your crim and do some SBs
[10:53:58] thehollowaytape: go 42 and chill out bruv @esfandtv
[10:54:00] Soap__64: You should call it an early night my guy
[10:54:00] lpdragon2020: Ron Mexico?
[10:54:01] GlitchyGunZ: something to make you laugh of your guy Jermaine @esfandtv https://clips.twitch.tv/BumblingAntsyRavenCclamChamp-46ORbt-fSKdHZxYL
[10:54:02] Lyvione: im second-hand tired from the dap stuff
[10:54:02] Orbilion: Nothing a cheeta inside Snr Buns can't fix pepeLaugh
[10:54:02] Alphawins: what is the pd progression path? is it only negative? doesnt every other job including crime have positive progression?
[10:54:04] Clodhoppr: ice cream?
[10:54:05] thebigchinballs: @esfandtv i remember when cornwood was just a vigilante with notepad and a gun being stopped by andrews LUL
[10:54:05] richiewho: #scrapthedap
[10:54:05] Zolothan: I like the vigilante angle but just worry about np rules
[10:54:05] Switchblade142: Hell my IRL job isn't even close to that
[10:54:07] Krypt1ks: I'm all for police self punishment but they need to have structure and other means of pursuing punishments and accountability before aoe dapping everything
[10:54:07] Pwnan: feels like the rant is warranted today
[10:54:08] Scarecro0w: do a roy salter character
[10:54:08] RunicCrustacean: daps should not wear off after 60 days.  If im not mistaken I believe crims can expunged their record in less time. you cant reduce your daps at all, you just have to wait it out.
[10:54:08] ArdentCause: I don't think and OOC talk is needed, Cornwood has relayed his frustrations multiple times. The captains need to take that into account and start understanding their officers better, like cornwood said yesterday, sometimes punishments aren't the best way of teaching someone. You have to approach each situation based on the characters ( its not unfair treatment, its understanding leadership styles)
[10:54:09] luis_king82: I just watch, I don't participate in the rp... but as observed there are characters that should change a little ... I hate clowns .. sorry chat
[10:54:09] slatt5: sometimes I wonder if they are punishing 4.0 cops for what end of 3.0 cops did
[10:54:10] Mouso9: Go shop for a vigilante outfit lol
[10:54:14] iwannanuhh: you could take a pd break and get some mechanic work done for a break @EsfandTV
[10:54:14] SMFTwistedSMF: Or you have been a tank with streaming. You may just need a break.
[10:54:15] Curwen89: JustAnotherDay one of us
[10:54:17] TenderPantyz: essaying damn
[10:54:18] LostNomNom: Watching Deans getting stressed out about the punishment is rather soul crushing since he does a good job at cop RP
[10:54:18] Deviii_: esfandL
[10:54:19] phaden_: HOLY essaying
[10:54:19] 1Tesla1: they will only fully realize how bad the system is when all the good cops have had enough and move on, then its to late
[10:54:19] RunicCrustacean: daps shooiuld be 30
[10:54:20] HoneyBK: that’s okay we still <3 you
[10:54:25] Scarecro0w: essaying
[10:54:25] biscuit_kevin: HOLY essaying

[10:54:28] Welshstig: his ice cream is being freshly squeezed from the udder of a frozen cow
[10:54:28] PsychoJoker: I agree
[10:54:28] swampran: hello chat didn't watch today, did cornwood get DAP'd for shooting osvaldo yesterday?
[10:54:29] taraannee: i think 7 days man
[10:54:29] hereforff9: yup
[10:54:29] Aynese: agreed
[10:54:30] smpies: 10 days is enough
[10:54:31] BradleyKalani: What would Cornwoods clown name be?
[10:54:31] itisacar: 60 days for a DAP, violent felony warrent 4 days
[10:54:31] Jrey000: 100% dpas being 60 days is ridiculus LULW
[10:54:31] nickdrawsstuff: Daps should clear each week
[10:54:32] Deviii_: essaying
[10:54:33] The_Boz1: theres a reason why some officers dont want to work on certain shifts. and if the captains cant notice and change then a change needs to happen in high command
[10:54:34] TenderPantyz: right
[10:54:34] MarkMakesArt: waht is DAP?
[10:54:35] kratoids: most ppl will probably quit in 60 days 😂
[10:54:36] Argoe: fr especially only 10 allowed
[10:54:36] hereforff9: 60 days is just wayyy ywayyy too long
[10:54:36] RavagedPistol: 14 days at most
[10:54:38] Winttyrr: they should last a fuckin week
[10:54:38] Keno_P: Ali time please
[10:54:39] omn___i: peepoTalk chat today I’m not showing up for the 2nd meeting peepoTalk I have to get some sleep peepoTalk
[10:54:39] P0TES: let it out
[10:54:39] Karter6t: Should be 1 week
[10:54:40] yaboygrumbles: 60 is insane
[10:54:40] Vurkkz: yeah thats way to long LULW
[10:54:40] Heezon2ya: Postive actions should deduct DAPS as well
[10:54:41] GoldPoints: should a DAP be liek 3 days?
[10:54:41] vxcant: even moreso if that person’s on duty more
[10:54:41] symoninc: it should be in game time
[10:54:42] Mawkatz: even 10 is way more than enough
[10:54:42] Fozenoh: 1 week should be max KEKW
[10:54:42] keith_2008: 10 days is enough
[10:54:43] illyB84: 60 days is fine if they give you ways to work it off. provides more RP avenues that way
[10:54:44] Dynomyth: I for sure don’t want you tired of playing this character
[10:54:45] Mawkatz: miss the old days
[10:54:45] f0rbin: @ArdentCause they have basically not listened to him from what i've seen
[10:54:45] Toastedgamer03: even turner said he doesn't want them less than 45 days which is a lot of days still for a video game rp
[10:54:45] LostNomNom: Now watching Esfand getting stressed about it is heartbreaking
[10:54:45] Eldargrim: Daps should be a meme not serious
[10:54:46] GlitchyGunZ: they should be like warrants for crims @esfandtv
[10:54:47] HoneyBK: yeah that is cray
[10:54:47] Van_1912: should be 7 days
[10:54:47] PoisonDart11: 60 is fine if there was a way to remove it
[10:54:47] Neekapkilla: @ArdentCause Yeah but based on captains meetings none of them care about this /shrug
[10:54:47] lawlkat: ya man. that's what I've been saying. When the DAP system affects folks OOC, that's when it's a problem
[10:54:48] alixrina: you might as well fire them if its up to 60 days
[10:54:48] Grilbur: Have you ever thought about making an ems
[10:54:48] Lite_Ice: it should be 2 weeks
[10:54:50] claptil: Technically getting on for 2 hours and leaving is safer
[10:54:51] yaboygrumbles: a couple mistakes over 60 days and you’re doomed
[10:54:51] s0stin: yea that would legit fix it aswell
[10:54:51] Resudue: crime dont stop tho
[10:54:52] KYslippy: one day is 120 years. 60 days is 7200 years
[10:54:52] Claxman2000: again, there will be zero active cops available within 2 months at the rate DAPs are given
[10:54:54] RunicCrustacean: if they wanna keep 60 they have to increase to 20 or something
[10:54:55] dutchman543: if you opened the sheriffs office could you set up your own rules?
[10:54:55] daddyhardtears: yeah it's horseshit cause then you get a captain like Ruth using it to literally get rid of good officers
[10:54:56] icephrogg: try out some Ali or samuel jackson for couple hours
[10:54:57] i_am_jam_: bobby charles can expunge all his charges faster than you can lose a dap
[10:54:57] Murrig: oh lordy chat is moving so fast they'll never know i like women
[10:54:57] Jrey000: 60 days in RP is like a whole Mayor election and run LULW
[10:54:59] old_mate_brucie: Cornwood needs to lead a police union
[10:54:59] ExpedientMiner: they considered dropping it to 45 days, but turner and ruth objected lol
[10:55:00] lolfish_rs: They said in the meeting that the lowest they'd want is 45 days kekw
[10:55:01] PsychoJoker: 15-20 days only needed for daps 60 is just stupid as hell
[10:55:02] Grubbyest: poor guy
[10:55:03] Kalious78: @esfandtv remember your meant to have a course with slacks to get some removed. Remind his ass
[10:55:03] shamison1: Can someone catch me up chat, what hapened?
[10:55:04] Vikarious_X: Such a powertrip system. Who keeps the captains in check?
[10:55:05] Vlazien: 60 days is crazy
[10:55:06] Belvai: server has been up like 50 days and only 3 peepes are over 2 daps
[10:55:07] Heimdallr123: Whats happened? We got more Daps?
[10:55:07] Aelgagar123: yea, 60 days that too real lifey, for an RP game for fun it needs to be way less
[10:55:09] SharkzGG_: @Murrig OuttaPocket
[10:55:11] azmer1987: To many hours in this world. Daps are part of the RP believe me.. I understand taking jt personally but It isn't
[10:55:12] Bromorin: what is a dap?
[10:55:14] TheLlamaTrainer: @Alphawins Its 100% only negative and enforced by the chiefs. They're also handicapped in every aspect of policing and forced to "RP" needs for unlocking things. Like being outrun every day for a month in chases to finally unlock new engines today lmao
[10:55:16] EPiQ: @Vikarious_X each other
[10:55:17] enzation: @shamison1 im gay
[10:55:18] BoogieAnimal: Daps should be like Crims "Months" in prison right? like why would it not
[10:55:18] BradleyKalani: Kinda hilarious how you have a bunch of engines in ur locker lol
[10:55:18] MarkMakesArt: random burger laying around?

[10:55:20] ChocolateMassage: Pointless
[10:55:20] Murrig: damn i got caught
[10:55:20] Heezon2ya: or Daps should have a 2 issue max for an incident, 4-5 for one scene is WILD when the max is 10

[10:55:23] official_fomaster: I WANT BURGER TOO BabyRage
[10:55:24] Big_Dave_420: daps shoudn't be 60 irl days if everything else on the server is not in irl days

[10:55:28] autorocket: union reps
[10:55:28] The_Boz1: @Murrig i know murrig.....
[10:55:28] nickdrawsstuff: @EsfandTV all of it can be summed up by the fact that Ruth came at you in-character about your Cornwood uniform, which is something you literally cannot control
[10:55:28] LostNomNom: Disciplinary Action Points
[10:55:29] spiderfaced: omg chomp it up
[10:55:30] decentenuff: @esfandtv you think DAPs should be removed entirely or removed and replaced w something else ?
[10:55:31] Kalious78: @esfandtv remember your meant to have a course with slacks to get some daps removed. Remind his ass
[10:55:31] Orbilion: KKornwood BurgerTime
[10:55:31] JDMVeee: CORNMAN begins
[10:55:31] SpiceWeaseI: @Vikarious_X nobody except maybe koil, buddha, and xqc
[10:55:32] Claxman2000: @vikarious_x no one, they are supreme dictators
[10:55:33] TheMah1337: also daps should only be used for serious things
[10:55:33] nochipapaquiliztli: Weed again?
[10:55:36] Alphawins: it should be fun to get a dap, if not get rid of the system entirely
[10:55:36] Welshstig: there should be a way that daps can be paid off, like fines
[10:55:38] Alkemiee: chat scrutinizes a CHARACTER and chat gets reprimanded......a 'character" scrutinizes chat .....its completely valid.........lmao
[10:55:38] Zolothan: whats going to happen is PD will suffer from the daps, officer numbers will drop, and then they'll change the rules to rebalance
[10:55:40] CowZ_Moo: you aren’t you when you’re hungry
[10:55:40] Fozenoh: SAJ Open na burger
[10:55:40] Antidomeitic: Sue the PD for Daps
[10:55:41] Mawkatz: @Vikarious_X no one. captains are immune to judgement
[10:55:41] Vangard__: 60 days makes sense for people who are going to play 4.0 all year, but for most people GTA RP only lasts a couple months
[10:55:42] illyB84: you gotta go bust some people for stupid shit. get out your frustration LUL
[10:55:42] fie17: @EsfandTV honestly you should pick your 3 strongest cases/changes for the DAP system and talk with turner or slacks OOC
[10:55:43] puppietreats: YEP
[10:55:44] Scrando: Hey but the new engines are nice Clueless

[10:55:51] decentenuff: Yeah. 100%
[10:55:51] bonkvpg: what does ocean king mean
[10:55:52] Murrig: people can actually lose income
[10:55:52] BlazeAndConfuse: @Belvai I think it's at least 6 now
[10:55:53] Switchblade142: To me the most frustrating thing is that you can literally get 4-5 of them in a single incident, it's just too much
[10:55:53] illyB84: YEP
[10:55:54] Heezon2ya: or Daps should have a 2 issue max for an incident, 4-5 for one scene is WILD when the max is 10
[10:55:55] PsychoJoker: it DAPS them mentally
[10:55:55] sourdeez: yea poor denzel
[10:55:56] luis_king82: what??
[10:55:56] HistoriesPiston: Its stressful

[10:55:59] Welshstig: make daps payable
[10:55:59] Grilbur: I love James Randals song

[10:56:00] SpiceWeaseI: @bonkvpg OK
[10:56:00] s0stin: yea crims dont have anything like that
[10:56:01] butlerian_jihadist: Make a vigilante character and team up with a Civ like Jason Polam and have him fund your vigilante crusades against crims LUL
[10:56:01] ArdentCause: Makes logging in that much harder everyday
[10:56:01] fkingjagaloon: i think turner said he should rp better
[10:56:01] GlitchyGunZ: I think it means you’re ok
[10:56:01] FatTony99: yes I know what you are saying
[10:56:02] Rivath: Den at 9 daps
[10:56:02] izahkiel: Yeee
[10:56:02] science_envisions: DAPs are wierd, where you can get a dap simply for wearing a hat, vs someone else shooting a civ
[10:56:03] 98noir: it should be per shifts honestly
[10:56:05] TheGreatMelon: @Bromorin Waiting for someone to describe it also.  I'm lost
[10:56:05] f0rbin: ya, ask deansocool, when he comes back in a week cause he's stressed LuL
[10:56:07] chivvyy: that argument can be used for anything tho
[10:56:07] ArdentCause: no one wants to deal with that everytime
[10:56:07] taraannee: ya im sure dean doesnt love that his content has turned into 4 hour meetings of being yelled at in character LMAO
[10:56:07] ixpops: What did I miss?
[10:56:08] cocokitty: snr buns is fun if you wana have fun a bit
[10:56:08] magnets_: have you brought this up to HC in OOC? @EsfandTV
[10:56:09] Jeremyohno: Daps make things too serious
[10:56:09] BigBlue31: surely theres a middle ground between how OP PD was in 3.0 vs being useless in 4.0
[10:56:09] daddyhardtears: yeah and how does Ruth not get that? She is abusing it not just using it
[10:56:09] BoogieAnimal: Ocean Man!
[10:56:09] Jrey000: yea look at Den he is lossing a day of stream also he is stressed LULW
[10:56:11] Cerkins: VeryEs
[10:56:13] Eldargrim: yeah daps should be a meme like jail time
[10:56:13] Drizzle1390: +1
[10:56:13] slatt5: I don’t think they realize this isn’t their career & people will definitely go play a different game or different server if it doesn’t chillout
[10:56:15] Alkemiee: 'chat its not that deep....its rp"......................
[10:56:15] nochipapaquiliztli: Totally agree the DAP time period is really long, especially if you are on duty long days
[10:56:16] TheGhostlyOnyx: @science_envisions yeah it makes zero fucking sense
[10:56:16] bobbybeee: but you are supposed to be incredibly serious and just do your job to the highest standard...... like it's not a game.. lol
[10:56:17] hydr4d: VeryEs
[10:56:17] doworkson23: how many DAPs does cornwood have?
[10:56:18] EPiQ: tbf, crims are more likely to catch actual server points
[10:56:19] Diminim: hamburger inception
[10:56:19] daltun: that's kinda the same argument for crim consequences and why there basically are none now.
[10:56:19] Mawkatz: Should mutiny against the captains, and rework the system
[10:56:19] Jimmy_Tha_Quad: this whole game affects real life
[10:56:20] Zolothan: hit 10 DAPs, it will help them see it needs rebalanced
[10:56:20] lolveins: yeah i thought the ruth stuff was good rp at first but now
[10:56:21] Pwnan: daps are longer then prison time hahahaha

[10:56:24] Sadisticmedic: unnecessary stress playing a video game
[10:56:26] luxxen1: Like right now they could dap you for your vest and its so dumb and small
[10:56:26] hydr4d: ice cream modCheck
[10:56:27] Cordysan: DAPs are literally "fun detected" pepeW

[10:56:32] fie17: @Murrig daptain OMEGALUL
[10:56:33] auxjack89: When you got suspended you said you made the best of it bc that's rp
[10:56:33] ArdentCause: @Jrey000 to be fair he could have logged on today at 7am EST
[10:56:34] spiderfaced: fucking hilarious - chompin food in the stairs, chompin irl
[10:56:34] CowZ_Moo: @esfandtv i mentioned the IRL impact in another streamers chat and it was not taken well.
[10:56:36] SpiceWeaseI: @Bromorin Disciplinary Action Point, or Denzel Anxiety Point more accurately
[10:56:36] BradleyKalani: bro rps so hard he eats when his character eats
[10:56:37] autorocket: DAPs are almost designed to punish police who are on duty more
[10:56:37] jemberella: why are ppl up to 10 daps though?
[10:56:38] condor2104: go play PalWorld, there is always something else
[10:56:38] melense: 60 days in an irl jail sentence

[10:56:45] 1cyveins: exemEat Clap
[10:56:46] keemotherapi: @luxxen1 we already know how ruth feels about those lmao
[10:56:46] Neekapkilla: They don't want you doing police work and figuring things out right now, and from what I have seen for quite awhile. So if you are doing police work you will get DAPed trying to train you to sit in the PD and do paperwork and let crims run free right now
[10:56:46] Murrig: fun = daps
[10:56:47] Mawkatz: @PsychoJoker captains are the admins. thats why its such an issue
[10:56:47] Raptorious_: AINTNOWAY DAPTAIN
[10:56:48] volicarebear: this PD is just too serious imo
[10:56:48] The_Boz1: @EsfandTV do the captains get daps for when they do something wrong?
[10:56:48] WhereTisWaldo: if you got fired cornwood you could completly dismantle the PD  but i know youre too much of a nice guy

[10:56:49] keith_2008: PogU Clap
[10:56:49] The_Original_Badman: Weaponized days off > weaponized DAPS
[10:56:49] clutch_evans: i sense a Cornwood-led police strike against DAPS in the near future...
[10:56:49] Bromorin: @SpiceWeaseI thanks
[10:56:50] shamison1: Chat catch me up, what happened?
[10:56:50] RedpiII: crims should get more time for repeat offenses
[10:56:50] johnnycolision: DAPPED if you, DAPPED if you don't
[10:56:50] Jrey000: @ArdentCause why would he to get dapped again LULW

[10:56:54] coldan01: daps getting to you man
[10:56:56] a_ato: ?
[10:56:57] sabsab4: I understand they don't want the police just running around doing whatever they want like randomly pulling their guns out.  But they put too many rules in and sucks the fun out
[10:56:58] GoutOfWar: @CowZ_Moo hopping is cringe dont be cringe
[10:56:59] Orbilion: UltraMad DAPS
[10:57:01] Gachiguru: RP isnt realistic for crims and RP is super realistic for cops
[10:57:02] cocokitty: let’s go to snr buns
[10:57:02] lpdragon2020: Ron Mexico
[10:57:02] nickdrawsstuff: 3.0 had ups and downs though, and was never like this
[10:57:03] Lyvione: the RP starts bleeding bad into real life if the rules of the game are not balanced
[10:57:03] itsNudeGrandpa: I had fun once but now I'm a Twitch chatter
[10:57:04] Belvai: @luxxen1 yet he has been told time and again about his vest, so thats on him
[10:57:05] Sizzlaa: forsenHobo knxBREAD it's mine
[10:57:05] HavocusRex: demerits and gold stars are some kindergarten shit though
[10:57:06] EPiQ: I got a point on NoPixel for towing something that wasn't parked illegally enough. I also got one because I was AFK in my apartment for 25 minutes taking a dump.
[10:57:06] ChocolateMassage: Flashback
[10:57:06] Alexpcorbin: I get it, you come to an RP server and there’s a system if you don’t RP this certain way 100% of the time then we can take your RP time away
[10:57:07] Krypt1ks: Yea the people playing cops not showing up eventually will show them there results of AOE dapping everyone
[10:57:08] woolfdesign: IRL life altering
[10:57:09] Murrig: yo dapfand
[10:57:09] GlitchyGunZ: treat like a warrant ? maybe two weeks @esfandtv
[10:57:12] lawlkat: the captains OOC couldn't understand why cornwood playing more wouldn't yield more chances for DAPs. it was astonishing to watch their meeting the other day. it wasn't even in character. Ssaab was telling chat to shut up
[10:57:14] jdickson93: why cant DAPs be removed for good behavior too, wouldnt that make it balanced? @EsfandTV
[10:57:14] xxvampxx: fuck that man
[10:57:15] LogiqueGaming: What does DAP stand for? can't google anything about it
[10:57:15] Ciefon: seems like that warrants an ooc discussion then
[10:57:16] BradleyKalani: its like a debuff that sticks for too long
[10:57:18] bobbybeee: is this something you can sort out OOC?
[10:57:19] Jrey000: @Gachiguru this is a great way to say it LULW
[10:57:19] PoisonDart11: @PsychoJoker ssaab is the only admin ICANT
[10:57:20] illyB84: basically DAPs are nerfing the PD
[10:57:21] allendork: there should be levels with the daps where the length scales on how bad it is
[10:57:21] Kev_Prime: Ron Mexico Main Char!!!
[10:57:21] cboys41: are you doing anything OOC about daps? @EsfandTV
[10:57:22] xnicolerose21: @EsfandTV do you guys talk to them out of game about it?
[10:57:23] TheLlamaTrainer: Well when people are DAPing people over wearing hats it looks like a serious power trip
[10:57:23] Alphawins: there is a discipline system, THE LAW
[10:57:24] iwannanuhh: demotion and sent back to academy and cadet would be better than suspension... that way you could keep producing content and having fun
[10:57:24] seandabomb819: Why  does Cornwood have DAPs?

[10:57:26] clutch_evans: Cornwood vs. Daptains
[10:57:26] Syndaar: they should make FAPs too, fucking awesome points for when you do sick nasty shit
[10:57:27] taraannee: i think daps should only be for insubordination, or purposefully doing shit u know u shouldnt, not honest mistakes
[10:57:27] BoldSlowbro: Ron Mexico please
[10:57:27] heftylefty_prime: Ali or Ron Mexico time?

[10:57:32] xxlonegunmanxx: Protest.
[10:57:34] TheGhostlyOnyx: @CowZ_Moo it ain't cringe some of these people are stressed in real life cause of daps bro it's a game rp should be fun not stressing people out in real life
[10:57:34] butlerian_jihadist: Cornwood isn't getting DAPs chat, the threat of DAPs are having a chilling effect on his ability to do police work
[10:57:35] f0rbin: @LogiqueGaming Denzel Action Points
[10:57:35] Sizzlaa: ali baba

[10:57:36] PsychoJoker: @PsychoJoker yeah
[10:57:36] bobbyboybonbon: your doing the hours of a real cop but dealing with such bullshit. gotta take a step away from pd and play the game the way crims do
[10:57:38] Murrig: diversity hire daptain LULW
[10:57:39] Neekapkilla: @lawlkat Yeah according to ssaab everything is going according to plan.
[10:57:40] Zolothan: turn daps into HP house points, a give and take
[10:57:40] ArdentCause: @Jrey000 I mean agreed but he did his time. It's just so much harder to log in after that and knowing you have 1 more chance + 60 days without fuck ups
[10:57:40] nickdrawsstuff: Just kill the captains and ocean dump them
[10:57:41] b0brossesdad: GO ON STRIKE
[10:57:42] Jimmy_Tha_Quad: police work is tough

[10:57:45] 360ski: How about awards and shit for good things like busts and arrests
[10:57:46] BoogieAnimal: Ya Idk its a weird issue for sure. Are Daps new to 4.0?
[10:57:47] Kaisenjin: @ArdentCause Denzel had a problem and can only stream again on Feb 1
[10:57:48] ibeleary: crazy how this all started from joey parma
[10:57:50] endorphinist: ICANT
[10:57:50] SpiceWeaseI: @lawlkat yeah they can be pretty clueless but i dont blame them it's their new system and they really want it to work
[10:57:51] Claxman2000: Cheever said the DAP system is good today ooc, so I doubt it’s changing. @esfandtv
[10:57:51] Leafyerick: @EsfandTV a 10 DAP limit when you can get them for doing SBS is crazy. It's like people want you to play Cornwood but then they're telling you not to be Cornwood, just be a serious cop RPer in Cornwood's skin
[10:57:53] Sillyanne: go do something that makes chat emote again, my eyes are hurting scanning paragraphs buttsoPepeW
[10:57:57] ShadowedSeraphim: @esfandtv time for Cornwood to take some time off to work on his mechanics trade
[10:57:57] Luthonen: how about at 10 daps you have to attend academy again
[10:57:57] ZorsStream: tbh daps should be one at a time and at least two captains should have to agree on it. then make them 30 days and a max of like 5. the system just needs rebalancing
[10:58:00] Aelgagar123: I think the threat of permanently getting your character fired as a cop, when its so hard to become one in the first place is not super fun.
[10:58:00] Vengy: chat please dont attack the captains in their streams. They're just trying to set a tone and ease up later on. Xiceman confirmed this.
[10:58:00] Raja_Banhammer: lookBoth
[10:58:01] ape2gethrstronge: yea ocean dump ruth EZ
[10:58:01] BelllGoR: you say the strict bosses make for good rp but its not "fun" rp

[10:58:03] TheGhostlyOnyx: @Sillyanne essaying

[10:58:08] nickdrawsstuff: @SpiceWeaseI doesn't mean its a good system though
[10:58:08] Mawkatz: @lawlkat he says its not about learning from mistakes. thats its about principles. and daps will be given regardless of whos at fault
[10:58:09] fie17: @lawlkat I think this arguments def need to be held OOC out of game
[10:58:09] xxlonegunmanxx: Minimum Police work, 1 shift max, crim character the rest of the time. Let PD be a skeleton crew.
[10:58:09] Orbilion: essaying
[10:58:10] Toastedgamer03: yeah honestly if people are getting affected by daps they should either just play as different characters, just don't sign in on duty as that character, or play something else for a bit
[10:58:10] xxvampxx: BibleThump

[10:58:21] Jrey000: @ArdentCause yea I feel bad for him I really hope we get LASO and esfand and other in the LASO department can make DAPS more forgiving
[10:58:23] Serakkis: I feel like 30 days is enough. You can rack up 3-4 a time if you something 'dumb' or lose a 'he said/she said' scenario. Having that hanging over your head for a irl month is enough.
