[1:58:00] AltaSee: Why does Jason even entertain the idea of working with the company after all the shit they've pulled on civ gang?
[1:58:05] Faisallu: 5Head

[1:59:06] FRAlex010: gramps dont know of the copany deal
[1:59:07] dwomak: i would wait to trade until you have 4-5 to reduce the risk of getting more duplicates
[1:59:09] crazyiitopii: What about your bestie Levi is he Hydra?
[1:59:14] balancedtofu: thing is civ gang doesnt listen to eugene  om

[7:54:54] Crazyman114: Jason hasn't a bad idea yet.
[7:54:55] midzito: i dont even think anyone in civ gang has the rep to talk to the monkey guy to do the trade anyway so might not be a bad idea
[7:54:55] Ace1507: even if they only give you info its kinda worth

[7:54:59] Baggysallss: good idea if most of group is on board
[7:54:59] NovaSueno: Think it's good. Mutually beneficial
[7:55:00] Phasehero: I think he's doing a lot without the consent of the whole group
[7:55:02] Tenivir: it makes little sense in rp
[7:55:04] emrhys95: dem sweet, freshly baked, supple, scrumptious Danish pastries
[7:55:05] Muffinsrevil00: its smart but they  may screw you all
[7:55:05] Fenroos: info its so importat, its a good deal
[7:55:07] shellfiee: my honest opinion hes actually in love with nora
[7:55:07] pringlefudge: I think Eugene and Jason are gonna bump heads with a lot of things
[7:55:08] Black_Griffin: its just one more usb to get a split, thats massive no?
[7:55:10] renaldorini: Too many big decisions without talking to rest of group
[7:55:11] Dumi90: i mean the only one that has bad relations with u guys now from company is ray
[7:55:12] suddenreign: i think nick realizes he cant outpace the company cause civgang is kinda casual so hes trying to ride the companys coattails to be #2
[7:55:13] Flugger1: I would not, it's gonna be to many people
[7:55:14] xczak: family will be pissed
[7:55:14] Jackpic07: i honestly think its gonna lead to a bank heist, so theyre probably going to bring you in on that
[7:55:15] Marilyn_1020: company just use people to their advantage you guys just need to be cautious
[7:55:16] evkay: Eveyone needs to be on the same page tho, will eugene ever accept that
[7:55:17] Kenjack1984: i think they will end up fucking you over but you dont know unless you try
[7:55:18] Bjarkar985: but there's always only one winner, so they might fight it out and shit could turn messy
[7:55:19] M0hkofantti: The unlock might be for the big heist like for the Claytons gruppe6 doors
[7:55:20] icecreamnuke: Good for rp but probably getting played
[7:55:22] midzito: @Acie does anyone in civ gang even has the rep to talk to the monkey head npc for the trade?
[7:55:22] mavericks312: I wouldn’t give them there last usb cause that’s when they could turn on you
[7:55:24] tete_ro: usb`s expire in 50 days, you have to account if its worth messing up your set
[7:55:24] VaeelL: I feel Jason will be rolled so hard at some point because he like that game, bt he don't who he play with... ppl who know the city since years
[7:55:26] namomo58: F the company
[7:55:28] walrus_from_space: progression wise its a huge win imo

[7:55:35] mryoussen: worst case scenario you get info plus you can demand the 75btc back they still win for not having to wait 48hrs
[7:55:35] gruegd: Only Eugene will make a fuss about it.
[7:55:36] AddyAdam: its really smart to get friendly with bigger crews, like what you are doing today. That way you are more protected

[7:55:44] DreamsPeek: I don't know that there's a way to mess the company over anyway
[7:55:44] Crazyman114: relationships are king boys

[7:56:37] icecreamnuke: Decisions with discussing with the group is bad
[7:56:38] khanoute: Jason doesn't take into account the feelings of his group members, Eugene said Company ocean dumped him and shot Nunu
[7:56:38] Bjarkar985: @xdsatan666 I don't think it was all JP no?
[7:56:48] flexxr_: its good, company and civ gang seems like a good collab, just Play it careful. There is more to gain than to lose

[7:57:25] Bjarkar985: This feels like Nick wants the end result and doesn't GAF about the rp element
[7:57:42] catquickspider: nunu is the one that knows ray the most and she does not trust him at all
[7:57:48] xShiryu23: @khanoute yeah but tbf and tbh the group does trust jason. regardless if they physically say it, you know?
[7:57:49] khanoute: Jason comes accross as desperate to please the Company because they are much bigger
