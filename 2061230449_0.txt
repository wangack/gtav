[3:20:30] CandleLit7: The 12 a group is hard to keep straight with heists and weed
[3:20:31] Nicolasamw: Wasting butc just kicking sellers and adding them back
[3:20:32] zZAstrozZz: this is why u should keep weed and heist separate
[3:20:33] Najb0lji: 1 gang for heists 1 for weed maybe? that way you don't waste BUTC managing weed farmers/sellers
[3:20:36] richdawg6045: should of just listened to OTT
[3:20:39] RajinKatakuri: wait there was a fresh chip in the bench
[3:20:43] Skillah10s: thats why you need 3-4 main ones and take 2 guests that dont require chip
[3:20:43] TheLiddlean: This is why OTT said Zaza should be for robberies only
[3:20:46] Gaz_H20: you just need to keep the chips instead of letting people keep them
[3:20:46] trekkky: lol ray doesn't know
[3:20:48] jypseydanger: see you after 1 hour
[3:20:48] Oozy24: HUH

[3:22:03] matpat3212: kit is fit
[3:22:06] cbjester: @Lurdzz That's what KJ asked OTT to do earlier today so they could free up more spots for new sellers, but I think OTT went to bed before anyone woke up so the request wasn't relayed.
[3:22:07] chechlto1: cooked
[3:22:07] ikonik098: How many dongles does company have?

[3:22:42] trekkky: LMFAO

[3:23:33] ericmw: Mickey wanted to wait until after they collect all the USB's, which seems like the worst idea. It might lock them into Anita with hacking progression or something

[5:31:02] LEEMURS_: @funix_nectar that‚Äôs funny if you think Jp is giving anything up
[5:31:03] lowvr6tj: @funix_nectar IC and OOC, Jp isn‚Äôt returning anything.
[5:31:14] Wild_Satori_Forest: @billy0c makes them feel cool
[5:31:17] KaL_id: Ott bought all 6060 not racks and spent all his money which was 50k plus left grime to get mats from sani and lost rep allnfor company
[5:31:21] paradox_1003: @tomfurnox with the mats ott and dragon got plus Ray bought TONS selling his car
