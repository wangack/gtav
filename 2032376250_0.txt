[11:52:32] 422deandre: The way i see it, people use cheese jumps to get away from cops all the time, whats the difference with 1 towel

[11:53:18] Titan2TT: BENJ!
[11:53:31] JohnnysHappyHideout: @Knightsofblood His problem is that his hours are divided between Twitch and Kick so you can't really tell.
[11:53:34] imjust_pat1: what are your normal hours?
[11:53:34] freaksho_: how are they gonna say the #1 isn’t streaming enough
[11:53:36] Knightsofblood: @zelxiepooh its probably cuz its split between twitch and kick
[11:53:36] ivan_jerganovv: !benji
[11:53:37] RaycBot: www.twitch.tv/lysium
[11:53:37] Kura_JAY: I like this subathon more. It's a waste if sleeping is including in the timer.
[11:53:42] Xavs__: lol
[11:53:45] Knightsofblood: @johnnyshappyhideout yup agreed
[11:53:46] SmokyMcdope420: 410 hours over 28 days is an average of 14.6 hours a day if that aint enough i dunno what to say lol

[11:54:10] Knightsofblood: @zelxiepooh sure he would? CYR should up. He doesnt stream daily
[11:54:22] JohnnysHappyHideout: @Knightsofblood But since he had to take 3 days off to handle irl stuff and doesn't ONLY stream RP when he streams, he's probably at like 60% of Ray's hours at most.
[11:54:30] riftshadow: The Taco guy is a Player right

[12:38:38] yazakeli: Lang has been exceptionally mean to JP... I think he's over it.
[12:38:38] WORLDSTARROCKSTAR: @jesscdcc leaving them which makes also sense
[12:38:38] jesscdcc: @Geniuswind ohhh his storyline
[12:38:40] Khul_Sardaukar: he still salty about having his own pc?
[12:38:44] KirinRamen: HE REALLY LIKES YUNO YEP
[12:38:48] IDKIDCFF: @LKXSeventh  frfr
[12:38:53] g_host_28: He took a pc too
[12:38:53] NoFapx: Surely
[12:38:54] ganjapanat: X is Tsundere
[12:38:56] stradam_: juicer speck
[12:38:59] CallMeAydin_: yuno leaving fucked you guys over not him tho mhm
[12:38:59] JayDaBoy_G59: Jp Loved Yuno Sadge
[12:38:59] p__dragon: @jesscdcc x just being x
[12:39:00] bl1p5: we just dont understand juicer sometimes
[12:39:04] CJ_hope: X is definitely a tsundere
[12:39:04] AidenPNW: @g_host_28 he made the pc its not a prob
[12:39:05] Kura_JAY: He has a different vocabulary. We need an X dictionary
[12:39:06] jesscdcc: @WORLDSTARROCKSTAR from yunos point of view tbf it made sense
[12:39:06] aimsbadsoirun: can you project things on the tv?
[12:39:06] Ashercolborn: Disloyal is the word JP wants, maybe
[12:39:07] Guccirina: yes i speak fluent juicer
[12:39:12] KirinRamen: JP to yuno is like a lil bro ofcourse hes mad KEKW
[12:39:13] sickshots117: Yuno built a PC then left LOL
[12:39:13] Diiavelo: ABANDONMENT
[12:39:15] l_bert: @yazakeli that's not mean, that's just close friend insulting each other, normal for some males
[12:39:15] Shadowdott: @Ray__C How much do you guys value butcoin at? being 24h/1 ?
[12:39:16] gemini4601: Ray is now fluent in juicer :)
[12:39:16] zettavion: He didn't even say anything to x too kinda sad
[12:39:17] tmorey123: AYO Yuno fucked yall lol

[12:39:22] ChaBoiShottz: house lookin good
[12:39:26] jesscdcc: @p__dragon ohhhh okay makes sense! just wanted to make sure i didnt miss anything and yuno did something
[12:39:28] CriticalRoleplay: Yuno was a board member who abruptly left. His influence in the game was part of his value and The Company lost that without warning.
[12:39:29] GLOCKBREEXY: i speak juicer and can confirm
[12:39:34] im_motive: @sickshots117 true
[12:39:36] NoTaGain15151: yuno and jp are very similar in that both are very heavy self insert character
[12:39:38] xecor123: In this scenario he literally meant fucked us over tbh
[12:39:38] ElusiveV2: the only reason he says he fucked us over is cause yuno was his hacker
[12:39:39] g_host_28: I understand the juicer he mean betrayed EZ
[12:39:42] dggvault: @Ray__C X saying "Fed us over" is like a college kid saying "this is literally the worst things ever"... meaning it was like just a bad thing
[12:39:45] IDKIDCFF: no hack  so yuno seem not much value sadly o7
[12:39:48] ghostlikedevil: my cat speaks juicer and can confirm
[12:39:48] youngdec: Yeah, he wouldn't have been mad that Yuno didn't call him if he meant in a bad way
[12:39:51] draugo21: Yuno screwed you guys emotionally.  Not physically
[12:40:00] Typhloxio: @jesscdcc watch the vid of the call between x and yuno yesterday, they talked some deep stuff
[12:40:01] bb8077: Company asset raycCheer
[12:40:01] soIoleveling: yuno doesn't even hang out with lang so weird
[12:40:02] jaymarsh88: did Ray talk to JP about the conversation with Eugene yet?
[12:40:13] SmokyMcdope420: has anyone checked mosleys to see if there are new cars in stock yet?
[12:40:15] gemini4601: @jaymarsh88 ye they had meeting
[12:40:21] jesscdcc: @CriticalRoleplay tbf x said if your not 100% onboard leave before the next checkpoint, so he left before they got their first app bc he didnt wanna feel like he was using them leaving after that
[12:40:34] yazakeli: Yuno created alot of the drama and acted innocent then just left. I would feel some type of way too.
[12:40:43] Typhloxio: @LVL_100_Charizard_ Yeah and he was against grinding when lang literally makes him grind 10k per week lol.
[12:40:49] jaymarsh88: @gemini4601 Thanks!
[12:40:49] aiai566: you guys get 7 coins a day. 3 btc is nothing

[12:41:50] JCerris: @jesscdcc from x perspective, he thinks yuno told Lang what D Company wanted circuit boards for before anyone knew, leading to Lang raising their 3 per deal to 15 (eventually negotiated down to 10 then 7). Then yunl took a PC and left them (he bought his one Circuit Boards tho

[17:37:42] freaksho_: I’m genuinely surprised there isn’t any large storage boxes yet
[17:37:44] slickd0g: @Ray__C no way devs made it so people can make 5k per day doing nothing
[17:37:47] maxultant: butcoin to hte moon
[17:37:52] SkytheKidd_343: There is so many little things you can do, its really cool
[17:37:52] allanthomasivanHD: i like this emote hmmMeeting
[17:37:55] mottarro: no way thats 24 hour bruh
[17:37:57] void5678: Can you organise the pilling of the items Ray
[17:38:01] Bajsilino: 1 butcoin is 24 hours of work, so 5k seems reasonable
[17:38:01] TheAirWalker: depends on how much butcoin you need to do jobs later or for other apps
[17:38:02] 3lonpich: you save 6 days of waiting, thats kinda huge
[17:38:04] Mundosaysyourfired: @slickd0g the market sets the prices
[17:38:12] 0utatime_: I mean no one has that much money
[17:38:19] easyej: it takes a day to farm
[17:38:19] GoatNamedFeliciaa: I think 10k per s8nce each pc only makes 1 a day and you have to burn 1 for the transaction
[17:38:21] takeuchi: i guess it depends how much ppl value irl 24hrs cuz 6 butcoin = 6 days
[17:38:22] 7solar: @Zash2028  jp built a secret room in the basement, computers are behind one of the walls
[17:38:26] Mundosaysyourfired: you can say no way circuit boards were meant to be sold at 8 10 15 bucks per
[17:38:26] rreal1ty: *trump voice* millions of dollars
[17:38:27] tbdd0601: hes been sick for like 2-3 days
[17:38:29] topmiddle: isnt he on?
[17:38:29] hellrocker0009: is RP really fun in the later stages? @Ray__C
[17:38:30] slickd0g: @Mundosaysyourfired yea, so i think it'll settle around 500 or 1000 max
[17:38:32] SkarredBlue: 24 hour timegate and electricity bill + parts that degrade, aint no way its 8K, got to be more
[17:38:34] Zash2028: @7solar Thanks
[17:38:38] ryanw860: Saving 7 days of wait is worth alot
[17:38:38] floridadog: dont wanna back seat but the grime box can carry 80 pieces of wood, ott told you but you were cooked so i doubt you remember
[17:38:39] kiss_me_noob: and also power
[17:38:40] paulsaade85: How long are you streaming for today
[17:38:45] mottarro: 1 butcoin per 24 hours should be worth alot more tbf
[17:39:00] kilugradi: @Mundosaysyourfired thats so low what u smoking

[17:39:14] slickd0g: THE CASINO HEIST WAS THE PINACLE FOR ME IN THE LAST SEASON
[17:39:18] yyonniepz: better then the casino imo
[17:39:18] tremm_ble: I've been watching since the trailer days bro
[17:39:19] Chisaee: @Theshadykid23 omE
[17:39:20] acidmastersF1: this is the perfect time to get into it
[17:39:21] KirinRamen: @Ray__C what do you think about 3.0 overall?
[17:39:21] GoatNamedFeliciaa: Do you guys know how much your electrical bill is yet?
[17:39:23] werry__b: @paulsaade85  17 h
[17:39:25] daltonthesprout: yeah and you will have your own cars.. new crime, racing... all of the fun heists and stuff opens even more rp
[17:39:25] PurgeVal: the pacing is slow with pcs ngl
[17:39:28] rageryouth: Why do you think that RP is so popular? Like the psychology behind it?
[17:39:31] JuicedUpJuicer: !gigi
[17:39:31] RaycBot: Giavanna "Gigi" Costello is played by - https://www.twitch.tv/angelknivez ||| Giovanna "Gigi" Gambino is played by https://www.twitch.tv/geega

[17:39:38] acidmastersF1: i got addicted during 3.0 heist era and i missed out on context
[17:39:39] thethirstisrealll: 4.0 is the first time I've enjoyed watching RP and I'm sucked in hard trying to keep up with the different storylines
[17:39:42] topmiddle: YEP
[17:39:42] tlonelyg: We are in the foundation stages right now and all the stories are building. It's really interesting.
[17:39:43] borderlineboredom: are u guys gonna clap jason polam?
[17:39:43] sagemadge: smooth
[17:39:43] paulsaade85: @werry__b sry i mean when will he end

[17:39:47] calmcity: guns are not fun
[17:39:47] tumbling2RDnado: what happened to the pcs?
[17:39:48] Gersheyz: role play over gun play
[17:39:55] guinaresg: x giving ginger gifted subs to buy her a new pc irl. ginger got the best tip
[17:39:57] Ori0nAU: especially when people dont respect guns PepeLaugh
[17:39:58] theoutcastboi: Where are all the PCs?

[17:39:58] acidmastersF1: i like how everyone was poor af and it’s hard to build
[17:39:59] Chisaee: and the pcs?
[17:40:02] d1zzypenguin: Imagine the more miners get booted up the less rewards get distributed
[17:40:02] void5678: Can you organise the pilling of the items Ray... It kinda triggers something in me KEKW
[17:40:02] shashi2410: raycGamble
[17:40:03] georgieporge23: georgieporge23 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months, currently on a 12 month streak! 1 year !! settlers of catan is such a good broad game !
[17:40:03] RaycBot: Thank you @georgieporge23 for the 12 months of subs!
[17:40:03] Rhodes_exe: alot of the new streamers dont even know how to react to guns
[17:40:04] freaksho_: I hope they whitelist gun blueprints.
[17:40:07] floridadog: guns will ruin the server 100%
[17:40:07] Bajsilino: Its been a month and it feels like a week, at this rate it will last the whole year
[17:40:07] reece_corpsesprmcy: KEKW 󠀀
[17:40:08] smellipoopipiipii: Except the heists and minor additions, 3.0 felt like it was finished after like a month. 4.0 does barely feel started
[17:40:09] void5678: KEKW
[17:40:10] PAWPalo: wot?
[17:40:12] takeuchi: i wonder how many ppl have been caught with guns except JP
[17:40:13] StreamElements: Ray has an active Insta that you can use to stay up to date with him! raycHypeInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/raycgaming/
[17:40:14] Battenhall: gigi chatter? geegaHUH
[17:40:17] Risretto: Chat what happened to the 7 computas? Did they move them
[17:40:18] tremm_ble: You're cooked
[17:40:19] galaximus668: Butcoins update
[17:40:19] nioxes12: guns in general turns rp into a monotone situation think guns should always be rare and hard to get
[17:40:21] YukoZe: @takeuchi none.
[17:40:25] tremm_ble: Go to sleep Ray
[17:40:26] acidmastersF1: it’s ok Jason’s crew gets many chances
[17:40:27] Shadowdott: @Risretto hes not aware
[17:40:27] zzdka: @Risretto raided and GONE

[17:40:34] rue221: yall need gun soon
[17:40:34] Chisaee: chat what happened to the pcs?
[17:40:35] dluo15: holy fuick how much wood is there
[17:40:35] Shadowdott: xqcS its so good
[17:40:36] daltonthesprout: honestly i hope they hold out on guns for as long as they can... it makes rp so much better
[17:40:37] JimLaw: did we talk about rental prices?
[17:40:38] Mundosaysyourfired: @slickd0g that's too low, it really depends on what the PC actually opens to later on. If it actually leads to heists then waiting 6 days to do a heist or having 6 buttcoins or how ever many butts to get you to that heist as quick as possible is valuable. 500 -1000 is just too low
[17:40:38] shashi2410: raycSanta
[17:40:38] Killa112345: I like that the company has been getting most of the small and big unlocks first  also wanna see a war  between the company and Jason polom ome

[17:40:40] evieonvr: Hey Ray! raycSanta
[17:40:42] kapu69: I like how they are adding things as they go rather than having everything released at the start. Though it still sucks how meta and rumors spread within minutes of something being found or changed @ray__c
[17:40:43] Deity_oHw: @evceekathe2nd no not exactly. over time see started being more lenient with Ray and what he does.
[17:40:46] theoutcastboi: Are the PCs behind that wall?
[17:40:49] rock3rxx: what kind of stuff can you do with a PC @Ray__C
[17:40:50] tremm_ble: I have to watch clips, take your time
[17:40:50] paulsaade85: Is their amy recap for the party
[17:40:50] takeuchi: i mean mr. K flexed a PD gun earlier
[17:40:54] KleysanTexala: Even tho its grindy, it makes for those rp talking moments that meaningful and intense, and gives purpose to make the money
[17:40:57] DarkBloodRevival: @Jaxsilius yeah that comes with the fear of like a 40k fine in game carrying the guns
[17:40:58] daltonthesprout: house owner
[17:40:58] fahelllll: you kids are dumb someone topped Jean Paul in fines two days ago
