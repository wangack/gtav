[4:13:29] Sh0rt_bus: think about it like smoking meat slow is key
[4:13:36] CreamOwww: dont you need to build a room to focus on humidifying that room not the entire house?

[9:05:40] Anobii_TV: Usually 10 to 14 days at 50 to 60 percent is the sweet spot. Also keeping the room dark and around 60 degrees helps
[9:05:46] Vikinglegend93: more ventilation then?
[9:05:54] Galacticowboy: 5Head
[9:06:00] Anobii_TV: At least thats what I do IRL
[9:06:02] outsideinsiders: man, flashbacks to a much younger Me that found my one single plant, the product of 5 months of ‚Äúwork‚Äù‚Ä¶ destroyed by mold. I was devastated ü§£ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[9:06:40] Twitter1333: it might be coz there's more cooling than heating
[9:06:52] Anobii_TV: Yeah, I place fans down to just circulate the air in the room
[9:08:07] nerf406: Try replacing one of the nod buds
[9:08:09] Ragingbumblebee: try maybe a little more light or something
[9:08:15] Anobii_TV: Lol Im curious to see how realistic they got with this.
[9:08:33] killogic916: yeah, a dark room could be it as well
[9:08:42] killogic916: along with airflow and humidity
[9:08:42] Galacticowboy: or it just takes time and we don't know how much time the strains take compared to the mids/shwag
[9:08:57] fiction12211: maybe ventilation
[9:09:10] halos420: people taking it too seriously. the strained weed probably takes longer or yeah its broken
[9:09:14] apaceboldface: if not dry by Monday than something up
[9:09:18] Kreamfire: ventilation maybe
[9:09:29] killogic916: did weed 'break' same time the yput in this new panel ui?
[9:09:29] DarthMeggsy: irl light matters bc it degrades terpenes
[9:09:29] halos420: altrhough the humidity should do something otherwise why have it
[9:09:30] zypher01: Could just be the different racks dry at different rates but that wouldnt make much sense
[9:09:32] fiction12211: prolly broken
[9:09:36] garett789: You need a fan near by from what I have heard
[9:09:40] tread____: Maybe there's something new at the weed guy
[9:09:44] Anobii_TV: Dark helps form those crystals on the bud (Trichomes )
[9:09:52] Galacticowboy: swamp ass detector
[9:09:54] Galacticowboy: NODDERS
[9:09:58] garett789: And a dehumidifier
[9:10:04] Anobii_TV: Lol so probably doesn't translate in game
[9:10:10] Twitter1333: it has to have something to do with it
[9:10:12] Ragingbumblebee: if it all comes down to temp if they have taken into account temps the weed near the pc racks could end up being bad as irl racks have to stay cool
[9:10:22] Ragingbumblebee: lol just what i was saying XD

[9:10:57] zypher01: Would kinda suck if thats the case cause then a grow house couldnt be seperated into growing and drying
[9:11:05] tread____: Yea maybe call around
[9:11:06] zypher01: would have to have 1 for each
[9:11:12] spoobie09: I think the cooling heating and humidity will effect your weed drying
[9:11:23] garett789: Can you see these stats in the apartments? see what Chodies apartment is at since it works in there
[9:11:45] jasonquinn2022: Maybe put down humidifier
[9:11:48] zypher01: @garett789 Chodies weed stopped drying

[11:08:37] ItsEdBoi_: no for the markets
[11:08:54] ItsEdBoi_: and made a extra part to the front page

[11:11:09] 8R00KS: I thought the idea of Reit was the kick back money was nontaxed is it that there will be no tax on the purchase of the house too?
[11:11:10] ItsEdBoi_: Those are the numbers to fill into the yellow columns
[11:11:19] halos420: thats why owners have tobe investors first...
[11:11:19] genericusernameuno: How does 7.5% mark up make sense when investors get 10%
[11:11:26] ItsEdBoi_: to make the 5 week payback period basically 0
[11:11:52] killogic916: that 6 week markup (7-11%)seems low imo

[11:12:00] ItsEdBoi_: the 5 week remaining balance column
[11:12:04] zypher01: K was talking to Siobahn and she was saying REIT might not pass unless you can get the Treasurer onboard. They want that tax money
[11:12:40] killogic916: @genericusernameuno yeah, it dosnt at all. Markup should never be lower than 20% imo
[11:13:00] genericusernameuno: The markups gotta be way higher imo. 200k house should be 275k minimum.
[11:13:44] killogic916: that other tab has 7.5% markup for a 6 week payment.. isnt that just a loss?
[11:13:55] ItsEdBoi_: Yea so for vinnys house 13k will need to be paid extra for investors to get money back for the 5th week if they all decide to pull out
[11:14:07] ItsEdBoi_: yep
[11:14:45] halos420: tbf ott hasnt done much but talk lol
[11:14:47] bhudiekhal: banks steal like 2-3x the amount you borrow in a mortgage
[11:14:50] zypher01: OTT needs to invest some money in the company eventually
[11:14:53] ItsEdBoi_: U can def markup more, but those are the 5 week break even numbers

[11:19:16] PwnUWithEz: On 200k invested you are paying investors 20k after 5 weeks and if they reinvest another 24k after week 10
[11:19:30] Raven_SOA: smooth ridin car
[11:19:33] forfiet: @ItsEdBoi_ oh ok good. finally getting to pay them back so then they can start to pocket some money
[11:20:04] Dieson75: K even paid the guy who is not in the city anymore
[11:20:10] ItsEdBoi_: Those number are also based on 10% investors sooo the markup being higher default will be smart

[11:47:49] Lordbidwell: timmacLAUGH
[11:47:49] RisKkeyy: Yeah this super nice. No need for 3 floors or really even a hidden basement

[11:48:17] facelessXfactor: @riskkeyy having 3 floors with last floor hidden makes it less obvious
[11:48:20] Galacticowboy: as long as someone else pays for it k won't care LUL
[11:48:27] giggles5502: Yes k wants someone to make it look good

[11:53:23] CptSpaceBush: There is no point to hide it, he has already shown half the city
[11:53:30] OhhhFee: just have a false back instead of an entire flloor
[11:53:33] facelessXfactor: Who ever keeps putting deer heads every where makes it look worse lol
[11:53:35] zypher01: The entrance to the basement is good imo

[11:53:53] Gangstajoka: heavy box holds only light things lol
[11:53:56] jasonquinn2022: yea I wonder how long till you can rob people houses again
[11:53:56] alwayslurklng: yea liked Ming‚Äôs basement
[11:54:10] zypher01: Dont think people have experimented with what decorations you can actually walk through enough
[11:54:23] facelessXfactor: The company basement is set up legit
[11:54:29] CptSpaceBush: Agreed. Ming's basement is sick
[11:54:50] killogic916: @Timmac my idea is a jump over (so they cant see down) that has 7-8 options that are all traps and 1 that leads to stairs to go down and give height to get back out. XXOXXXXX
[11:54:53] zypher01: their entrance is very obvious
[11:54:54] pappanick11: have you put anything inside the box?
[11:54:55] Schlimmy: clipping through a wall is not legit
[11:54:58] Hey_its_Mady: Honestly you should get Cyd to decorate the house. She's too dedicated to decorating house
[11:55:08] RisKkeyy: Cuz ray spent like 40 hours decorating that house
[11:55:08] Dillz213: well a lotof time did go into the other houses for renters tho
[11:55:10] facelessXfactor: Yeah of course you can but your limited in RP
[11:55:16] tm_eng: killogic916 this isnt rust
[11:55:18] ItsEdBoi_: I think they added the extra walls and they made it worst cause once u walk through the wall u know its there, compared to just putting bushes around and needing to know extactly where to walk
[11:55:22] PwnUWithEz: Are you able to place a sliding door so at least it takes a few seconds before you fall down
[11:55:24] zerro_reloaded: @Timmac have you thought about bring back shaggy?
