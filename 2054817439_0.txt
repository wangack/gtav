[5:22:06] M0HAMM3D786: O7 den

[5:23:54] Clivent: NPC cops LUL
[5:24:04] TenseTokki: Hit a local and get away free I saw it literally
[5:24:18] ir0nbru69: At this point it would just be easier to replace cops with ai NotLikeThis
[5:24:31] ir0nbru69: 4.0 pd has been so dumb
[5:24:32] DizSpartan: LUL
[5:24:53] bizzleschwizzle: @ir0nbru69 cmonBruh

[5:25:26] cubanrichards: You just there for show lol
[5:25:31] Roke27: @uhSnow Is jackie going to get some love soon? I miss the boomer uhsBM
[5:25:39] AnnoyinMercenary: It's silly that you have to break off even if there's no other actives
[5:25:40] TenseTokki: Nerfed the PD into campaign mode cops that can hold a conversation  NotLikeThis
[5:25:42] Grimnaer: I watch some crim streams, and they don't like the new policy either, they miss the fun chases lol
[5:25:45] ir0nbru69: 2.0 pd was byfar the best pd
[5:25:45] meeto_tv: I think it’s a numbers thing, they don’t want people attached to a call for a traffic stop for that long.
[5:25:46] Lord_Legolas: Fun is not allowed for shift one, guess bt whom
[5:25:52] lukeyac: Den sounds so sad LUL
[5:26:03] ir0nbru69: When guess who was in charge snow
[5:26:06] GordoUK: i feel like you should break off when a larger call comes in, thats what makes sense in my mind
[5:26:13] 0Douglas: It should just be officer judgement honestly, if people fk around talk to them at that point surely?
[5:26:14] Gmoneyusmc: Don't see why having a PD if you can't give crims a good chase...
[5:26:19] PseudoSudo: The burocratic rp is too real NotLikeThis
[5:26:22] bizzleschwizzle: Need more cops, more civs with guns, heli's and subs....so basically 3.0 Kappa
[5:26:25] pottsie200: without a chase what is a cop really supposed to do
[5:26:32] StreamElements: PLEASE DO NOT BACKSEAT COP/GAME! Snow is playing the game and he doesn't need your help! There is plenty of other things to talk about in chat :)
[5:26:40] AnnoyinMercenary: in Shift 2 they really only break off if there's other stuff happening @uhSnow
[5:26:42] DTalmer: Finally get a chase just to back down all the time
[5:27:07] datsamuraiguy: write citations
[5:27:09] StarWhistle517: anticlimactic
[5:27:20] Pallywally: You just keep getting Blue balls
[5:27:20] Gmoneyusmc: why do just speed traps and give tickets to speeding people, what's the fun in that.
[5:27:33] Ihealutank: feel like they need to clarify the policy abit better
[5:27:37] animuson: It feels like they're trying to make cops follow reality too much when the other plays don't
[5:27:40] bizzleschwizzle: I mean cop evasion is a pretty big deal
[5:27:49] Stealthkillah122: The whole point of a chase is to escape. So why would you ever chase them then ? It would always be dangerous no ?  futchAggression
[5:27:54] wellion90: who is your shift leader=
[5:27:56] just_james69: I think that's why so many have lost interest in cop RP ATM just feel like they can't police
[5:27:58] wellion90: ?
[5:27:59] Gmoneyusmc: so when races start going.. .and they driving WAY reckless are we not just going to try and stop racers @uhSnow
[5:28:01] BIumenT0pF: the anwser will always be no endangering civs and not enough cops on shift to do chases
[5:28:08] Dominikun: They want every chase to be like the one with the guy that drove the speed limit and used his indicators while the cops followed him slowly xD
[5:28:09] x_glazier_x: take the fun out of it for the crims that like the chase too
[5:28:10] ArenaKrusher: Den is breaking off because he is paranoid of daps mostly LUL
[5:28:10] ir0nbru69: 4.0 pd sort of feels like there only there when somthing big is going down rest of the time there background noise unfortunately
[5:28:18] siearia: What diving off of freeway bridges during chases isn't real?
[5:28:21] Lil_Miss1: What would the difference be between a chase now & a chase in 3 months?
[5:28:25] aesthetixv: How much does GTA V cost on PC in £?
[5:28:25] 0Douglas: It would be consistent if people didnt second guess on radio every single chase, just let the primary decided and boom its fine OMEGALAUGHING
[5:28:25] 4lphaBeta: Turner's cool, I hope he's back soon
[5:28:31] just_james69: I miss turner ATM but OOC is far more important than rp
[5:28:40] ZeroSkills0s: would a system where one starts chasing and there's like some sort of timer and with each checkmark (say 5mins) another unit joins and so one, (that way the chase wouldn't last long if they manage to escape, which will probably happen often times) work?
[5:28:41] ir0nbru69: Just need soze to big dick the pd back into shape
[5:28:42] Stealthkillah122: @aesthetixv  google it
[5:28:43] RnG_Qwik: The only thing it makes sense on would be bikes. If they are driving reckless ive seen cops back off but never vehicles
[5:28:47] datsamuraiguy: 3 definitely feels like enough.
[5:28:49] MartMonster: "how much does it cost?" "idk money" KEKW
[5:29:10] lukeyac: isn't the problem that every cop apart from 2/3 are at mrpd?
[5:29:11] Beopuppy85: £16.17, but if you are asking in a chat instead of just looking on steam you arent a PC gamer
[5:29:20] ancientpeas: I'm sure most of the crims want you to chase them.  Most of them love car chases don't they?
[5:29:25] Beopuppy85: £17.16*
[5:29:30] Stealthkillah122: @beopuppy85  but can your pc run crysis Kappa
[5:29:31] bizzleschwizzle: I feel like timers would increase aggression
[5:29:32] TenseTokki: GTAV cost me 4 money Kappa
[5:29:36] crispysnowball: wth king charles got cancer?
[5:29:36] AfroAltruism: 2 much yapping KEKL
[5:29:37] BIumenT0pF: i am not saying three is not enough but thats the answer you will get
[5:29:39] Grimnaer: People aren't patrolling lol
[5:29:39] Beopuppy85: @Stealthkillah122 Most definitely lol
[5:29:45] DizSpartan: chases make for good RP. it’s too bad they’re being harsh about them. think COs would trust judgement of POs
[5:29:47] Dominikun: Denzel only uses the timer to ridicule the idea of timers I think.
[5:29:49] ir0nbru69: Oh different news chat wish me luck im doin my first full water loop today for my pc im scared LUL
[5:29:50] robert_earl: I always enjoyed the chases if everybody everybody involved was having fun
[5:29:56] 0Douglas: Surely if you are chasing someone you can tell when the time to pull off is, when nothing works and you cant catch them at a certain time is it really worth for a traffic violation
[5:29:58] StephyFace: I've noticed that bein a thing
[5:30:00] Toyola: I know sometimes they get caught up in MRPD writing reports
[5:30:03] djdeathchef: Scared to get daps Sadge
[5:30:04] meeto_tv: even if they just stacked somewhere else
[5:30:05] scott99901: and Toby Keith passing was awful too :(
[5:30:18] Stealthkillah122: @beopuppy85  cant wait for crysis 4 whenever that comes out xD
[5:30:25] Dominikun: Well, for Denzel, one DAP is enough
[5:30:29] Nellsn: Den is at 9, if he gets even 1 he's suspended indefinitely

[5:31:37] deceptiseannn: Cornwood has 7 but he doesnt give a shit
[5:31:48] Paxipher: Also, 3+ daps = 24hr suspension
[5:31:50] StephyFace: cornwood's done better tho so
[5:31:52] Toyola: Cornwood got 7 in one day and hasn't gotten any since OMEGALUL
[5:31:53] Fast_doughnut: i thought daps would be for out in field mistakes. Seemed to be at start it was for not doing reports properly

[5:43:49] NGVtv: Havent seen that would be neat LUL
[5:43:49] brrcold: Would make more sense if reckless endangerment of civilians permitted cops to use more force to stop the chase sooner (basically what crims expect)
[5:43:54] evil_bullett: snowPls
[5:44:02] quibs: Snow is a cop again!
[5:44:12] Fast_doughnut: it a big thing to even use spikes isnt it?
[5:44:17] meeto_tv: can you bind in game emotes to your stream deck?
[5:44:18] Beopuppy85: No Albert king is a cop @quibs :P
[5:44:23] quibs: Tru
[5:44:37] RonJon: its a weird paradox where you they're driving recklessly so you want to stop it but they're probaly driving recklessly because you're chasing them
[5:45:12] 0Douglas: It just seems odd when there is nothing going on, do they expect people to drive around the city doing "nothing" for 8hrs
[5:45:31] Alminta: More crime = fewer cops 5Head
[5:45:43] tenGreg: Reset day Pog And it was peepoSadLeave
[5:45:47] RonJon: There was one instance they stopped a chase because they hit a local so it was too dangerous, but also said that if it wasn't a local they probably would keep chasing to bring them infor the hit and run
[5:45:49] RonJon: lol
[5:46:26] 0Douglas: Pepega take

[5:47:40] 0Douglas: Conflict in RP is best to watch imo
[5:47:49] RonJon: it spawns so many great situations
[5:48:05] kunravong: Have you seen any more unusual locals?
[5:48:19] Bot_Frank: I think weighting the severity of a crime to the level of PD response will be good in the long run. But it is a bit frustrating to watch in the early days
[5:49:10] bizzleschwizzle: Wow...I expected it to cost WAY more with all that damage
[5:49:26] bizzleschwizzle: I saw that car roll like 12 times
[5:49:51] 0Douglas: I feel like overall in 4.0 PD resposne has been great apart from calling off of chases too early, Idk tho im just the viewer at the end of the day
[5:50:05] RonJon: If any characters NEED to be hard asses it's PD leadership lol
