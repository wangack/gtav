[1:08:58] Fakomi: That's actually what happened anyways, because they couldn't ocean dump everyone since the cops got to the beach
[1:09:09] cadbeaver01: people complaining about the ocean dump are being so stupid, you only fucking did it because he called 911 when down. The actual rp'er is a chill dude though and realized the mistake after

[7:19:26] eygton: no way is that new rule bc of graycen 😂😂
[7:19:27] DuckSmoke_: That doesn't make sense, they made it possible to rob houses and right after someone does it they ban it?
[7:19:30] RaspyStatus: @PAID_ACTOR1 he was the ceo of burger shot in 3.0
[7:19:32] MajoVapo: walkin on eggshels these while xQc is shooting the cops and shit
[7:19:40] relmo: they call it graycen's law in the city now

[7:21:03] cillixing: Slaycen
[7:21:04] Normanicz: yes
[7:21:07] DuckSmoke_: Did the guys they robbed go crying to xqc and he banned it to protect his friends?
[7:21:10] purplepoodle89: immersive
[7:21:14] RaspyStatus: @PAID_ACTOR1 i feel like you dont like lenny KEKW
[7:21:20] Normanicz: @Duck_Mallardly pretty much
[7:21:24] relmo: it makes the self insert aspect less obvious with cam off
[7:21:28] eygton: any1 have a clip of graycen talking about it afterwards ?
[7:21:41] BaddestCloud: piss off everyone and watch the world burn
[7:21:42] nosebeersx: @duck_mallardly he didn’t make the decision. the admins did
[7:21:44] watchmenaethan: if u fight everyone ur just a chihuaha
[7:21:45] wowitspeter: oh man that stupid reddit thread ICANT
[7:21:47] cadbeaver01: @Duck_Mallardly several groups did it before scam squad. No one actually knows why they aren't allowing it now. I heard the devs wanted to work on something and might allow the robberies again
[7:21:53] darkj4ck: @Duck_Mallardly no OMEGALUL @Normanicz xqc can't ban ppl
[7:22:01] MasterPunn: bro was about to hand him the donut om
[7:22:03] darkj4ck: or decide anyhting
[7:22:17] PAID_ACTOR1: not really, he's fine. im just calling it what it is @RaspyStatus
[7:22:22] nosebeersx: @cadbeaver01 it’s because cleaning out someone’s house just because you caught them off guard is shit rp from an rp standpoint
[7:22:28] cillixing: word his voice is annoying enough imagine having to deal with cam on top of that NAHH AINTNOWAY
[7:22:33] MasterPunn: notxqcL you're fucked Gary Guppers notxqcL
[7:22:42] cillixing: what a jackass
[7:22:48] relmo: oh yea he did fake mic issues during the robbery to get away because the cops got called
[7:22:49] auxjack89: the ban is also from ppl glitching into apartments and stealing
[7:22:49] ImpendingAgony: This mole should be shored up and encouraged though.
[7:22:51] udk3_dev: WutFace
[7:22:52] TBAGodzilla: WutFace
[7:22:54] MasterPunn: notxqcL you're fucked gary guppers notxqcL
[7:22:56] Lizzurdx: lol
[7:22:56] fyisic: WutFace ruined
[7:22:56] wowitspeter: @nosebeersx thats debatable. They are RPing as robbers thats what robbers do dont they? lmaooo
[7:22:57] cillixing: jackass jumpscare
[7:22:59] RaspyStatus: @PAID_ACTOR1 then you should know he was around way before 3.0 KEKW
[7:23:02] ErobbIsWhite: WutFace

[7:23:26] cillixing: COOKED fr
[7:23:28] RaspyStatus: @PAID_ACTOR1  BUT CLEARLY YOURE A NEW RP VIEWER kekw
[7:23:30] MasterPunn: graycenstutter
[7:23:33] DuckSmoke_: That's literally how most robberies are committed, catching the victim off guard.
[7:23:35] nosebeersx: @wowitspeter well I don’t keep up with all the “rules” but generally you want to give and take in terms of rp. ocean dumping them gives those guys 0 rp afterwards
[7:23:43] PAID_ACTOR1: @RaspyStatus ok lil gup om
[7:23:49] RaspyStatus: @PAID_ACTOR1 youlll learn dont worry
[7:23:55] cadbeaver01: @nosebeersx I think house robberies are cool. the issue is it should be harder to do it, possible security systems in houses etc could make the rp better but who knows
[7:24:02] udk3_dev: sus
[7:24:06] fyisic: nope dont
