[1:19:13] poopooindiaper: Add bookmark #4 To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to play HoI4 anyway. The depth of strategy is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of combined arms warfare, most of the tactics will go over a typical player's head.  There's also Germany's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into its focus tree- its personal philosophy draws heavily from 19th century Pangermanismus literature, for instance. The hardcore players understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity

[2:52:54] Dead4life_1: @Graycen you got your drink spiked at the rave sheesh
[2:53:03] snejpen: @Decoyduck probably cause they were added while he had a sub
[2:53:10] snejpen: @Graycen renew your 7tv sub you jackass

[2:54:41] snejpen: @Decoyduck all the zero-width emotes were added at the same time, probably when you gifted him
