[3:13:01] sickbound: theres no options other than furnishing lol
[3:13:04] cybigil: Honestly, I think the move would be to buy the rack, and sell the 2nd PC.  Would fund the GPUs and still com out ahead mining wise and power useage wise.
[3:13:30] Lepaca: try this thing I just pulled out of my ass strimmer

[3:16:46] cybigil: @maestro__21 Can just swap the hard drive.  K did it on the HDDs they got from the robery.
[3:17:08] ItsEdBoi_: @maestro__21 U would just set a price to the Btc and then multiply by how much is spent on apps and add that to desk price, The Company was selling 1btc for 10k sooo full apps would be worth like 100k alone
[3:17:14] ItsEdBoi_: 4k
[3:17:23] SheogorathJJ: This man is so Polish these new Polish dudes have such a destinguishable Polish accent. The only accent similar to it is European Portuguese I could place these two accents from a mile away
