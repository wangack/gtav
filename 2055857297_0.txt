[5:10:35] evolvo12: 70
[5:10:37] 2Giii: 60s
[5:10:43] morgado_4: he said he could try 99 aswell
[5:10:43] deivdeivdeiv: how do turbos work?
[5:10:44] bandito_o7: 99
[5:10:44] Axro_: he wants a 70-80 preferably
[5:10:45] zZEROo77: Or a 99
[5:10:45] r3d3y3z_: 99
[5:10:48] Axro_: But needs a 60-70
[5:10:50] whatitdoes69: get him a 60s
[5:10:50] U62charlie: 70 or a 99
[5:10:51] morgado_4: 99 is the best
[5:10:58] btjmga: @deivdeivdeiv same as in real life
[5:11:02] coffeeatm: He dont want top speed
[5:11:02] 2Giii: 60S
[5:11:05] nicolas_ej: chat does anyone know if ramee finish fixing the house ?
[5:11:09] piratethepirate1231: do u like the house rumee did
[5:11:10] coffeeatm: He want acerlation
[5:11:10] NoLifeDevGamer: its Permanant change ?
[5:11:19] killyfromthekeys: 90 isn‚Äôt good for his car more like 66
[5:11:23] lonestarlurker: it wasn‚Äôt noticeable at all
[5:11:27] stavrosthagreek: Turbos r in stock according to twatter
[5:11:29] killyfromthekeys: to much lag with the bigger ones
[5:11:32] U62charlie: I don‚Äôt think he knows how bad the wheel spin will be with a lower turbo
[5:11:37] Ezi_GG: will you be doing Chaos stuff in 4.0 @Shotz ?
[5:11:43] brkljesha: @nicolas_ej few bits and pieces left to be done
[5:11:44] Ratty1986: @nicolas_ej no I don‚Äôt think he did
[5:11:46] anthonytanza001: I wonder who keeps blocking the train tracks with buses and cars
[5:11:56] Mordis_: K not a highway blaster, he needs acceleration out of turns.
[5:11:58] killogic916: Yeah, wheel spin with a 50-60 gonna be a lot. but may still be better overall
[5:11:59] morgado_4: k said he could try the 99 aswell
[5:12:00] whatitdoes69: is there alot of different 60 sizes
[5:12:09] GrimCreaper580: big turbo gives more top end where as a smaller turbo would give you more low end or acceleration
[5:12:13] nicolas_ej: @brkljesha oh ok thx it was fun watching him stress lol
[5:12:13] btjmga: @killogic916 he wants like 70-80 tho
[5:12:19] Cruzier2012: try
[5:12:31] killogic916: @Mordis_ sure, but with rear wheel drive too much power in low end just means wheel slip
[5:12:54] killogic916: @killogic916 the 88 had no difference at all. I doubt 70-80 will either but who knows
[5:12:55] GrimCreaper580: ^^^^
