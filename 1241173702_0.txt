[3:26:27] HMDJAX_: right ear shot asmr
[3:26:51] jcomia1: @ilrani, they fixed it so you can have sprinters in MP a week or so ago so you dont need the mod anymore just set the zombie lore to active at night and sprinters

[3:27:47] ilrani: @jcomia1 its a bit differrent using the mod because the default settings with active, makes them really really weak during the day. with the mod, the zombies are still regular during the day instead of being weak.
[3:28:51] jcomia1: @ilrani, oh i never noticed that when setting them to be active at night i assumed they are set to default and not weaker
[3:28:52] Decimated_exo: i legit think Marco is just balsting for fun
[3:28:58] Ephraim_Noname: is there a point to killing all these zombies, wont they just respawn?
[3:29:00] Decimated_exo: and no real goal
