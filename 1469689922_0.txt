[0:57:10] Pappa__Goose: Not too long ago siz was going to be Heisenberg and run the whole meth market. uhnSuffer Now everyone is their own meth kingpin
[0:57:13] SpilledOrangeJuice: like buying chemicals from civs yeah?
[0:57:24] Freakassee: i dont think there was an in-depth plan for it
[0:57:39] jccooly: James you got me through my childhood depression thank you
[0:57:53] RezaQ8: Oil stuff is pretty cool
[0:57:58] SpilledOrangeJuice: going to the pillbox to buy 20lb of industrial grade amonia
[0:58:03] tadjh_: oil mechanics is really nice

[0:58:06] kerplunkity: NODDERS

[0:58:17] itspancak: i wanted to see a cleaning product heist similar to the heist in Breaking Bad when they steal the barrels
[0:58:23] tacoman22a: im more curious if the sprays are supposed to rest or if its just scuff and there more to it we haven't seen
[0:58:34] SpilledOrangeJuice: i miss the goofy drops
[0:58:34] MonteVidi: 2.0 was wild
[0:58:40] MonteVidi: like actual wild west of cocaine days
[0:58:43] kerplunkity: yeah uhnSuffer
[0:58:47] chocodreamzzz: Its much easier to be a millionaire Ciz than a millionaire Crim in 3.0 that's for sure
[0:58:48] Hardcastle1971: all that farm land  and no one grows anything but weed
[0:58:52] Meat_Ball07: my fave coke drop was the tyrone one, when he ended up chasing a cow for 30blocks
[0:58:53] Dark0verseer: nostalgia tends to shed the shitty aspects too though :P
[0:58:57] SpilledOrangeJuice: true
[0:58:59] dis_is_niko: yeah you can't have tyrone cut open a cow for coke

[0:59:41] MonteVidi: ok but tell me it wasn't intense when you had a car full of coke and the cops right there
[0:59:59] Jay_rb: yeah pushing coke at the college should be a thing
[0:59:59] Pappa__Goose: Its hard when everyone knows what goes into making drugs. Like how cleaning supplies used to be a dead give away to making meth
[1:00:00] MonteVidi: bricks on bricks of that shit
[1:00:06] Purplevivid: can locals push coke for you if they ever spawn again
[1:00:07] KingPresiden: uhnHello @MonteVidi
[1:00:10] kuro_xvi: coke has no strain/purity/etc. so no conflict generated from it, would be my guess.
[1:00:11] daveisghost: coke is just too far. meth is fine. coke? no go
[1:00:13] SirPenguin911: I forgot Siz was a brick king pin in 2.0 LUL

[1:02:00] ANDRO_core: @Tas_300 That's what I was thinking, when adding a chemical or any kind of crafting item for drugs give those items other legal uses for normal people
[1:02:01] ReAnalyze: uhnNotes
[1:02:01] SpilledOrangeJuice: would push cops to sandy too yeah?
[1:02:30] marcusi23: i really thought they would allow you to run coke again here in 3.0. because i thought in 2.0 you did well didnt abuse it even when people said you should. plus like the CG quest for the product
[1:02:35] MonteVidi: Siz always looked like he did meth sfhSIP
[1:02:41] RezaQ8: Why not NODDERS
[1:02:42] daveisghost: Even if you sell at a loss, at least it isn't going bad and making you nothing.
