[5:51:16] I3itches: thats a DC 20 check frfr
[5:51:29] Soov: lando basically said you're a halfling, so if you roll a 1 it turns into a 2 NODDERS

[5:52:08] shpuddie: crits usually mean drastic
[5:52:15] Sahneee: chadd
[5:52:15] SpectreUK: crit fail is it goes so bad that it affects you negatively
[5:52:15] Hummerino: no modifiers on a nat 1
[5:52:16] Anubiks: Why not
[5:52:16] PsychoBKilla: Cowol
[5:52:16] Gyfx: regular is just you can't do it, critical means you fail really bad nodd
[5:52:17] TheWhiteWillow94: WICKED
[5:52:17] SniperNamedG: if you crit fail no bonus can help you.
[5:52:18] drpeppertaco: crit fail always fails, a person with a huge bonus could roll a 2 and still succeed.
[5:52:18] ben0809: wikked
[5:52:18] ibruticus: chadd
[5:52:19] macrotoad: Reg failure is just doen'st work a crit fail is something like "deal damage to your friend"
[5:52:20] Anubiks: Start playing
[5:52:20] Soov: critical fail means something else happens besides just failing
[5:52:21] Goldflux: Cowol

[5:52:28] NonstopBlue: Pog
[5:52:29] Ominia: crit fail means u roll d100 for fail severitry
[5:52:31] Atdr52: you played bd3 NODDERS
[5:52:33] Misui: nat 1 just means a 1, no bonuses
[5:52:33] I3itches: you cannot crit fail a skill check frfr
[5:52:38] shpuddie: nodd
[5:52:39] macrotoad: nodd explodes
[5:52:39] Qyuyu: if you roll an attack and you fail, you don't hit the dude. If you critically fail you might hit a rock and break your sword @kyliebitkin
[5:52:41] darkopslayer: YEP
[5:52:42] Shadowyc: Crit Fails depend on what you're failing. Some spells have conditions. Crit Fails are mostly just you smacking yourself in the crotch with your sword.
[5:52:46] zachps: Someone who takes good photos Pog
[5:52:49] SirHellsing1995: YEP
[5:52:57] cshunter2069: critical failure is a fail with a neg consequence
[5:53:04] Goldflux: or the economy suddenly collapses again instead LuL
[5:53:07] I3itches: you can only crit fail attacks unless DM says otherwise

[5:53:42] Vixent32: sure
[5:53:44] ben0809: Hmm
[5:53:45] Shadowyc: peepoGiggles My DM had to rule that I crit fail knowledge checks if I roll a 1, because my Take 10 is 30+. But I played Pathfinder 1e.
[5:53:46] neonishere32: that’s cheating
[5:53:53] Soov: you crit fail into a negative boolean that makes you have infinite money NOWAYING
[5:53:56] eborcurean: fail forward is a thing in some games, but not D&D. But if you're the DM you get to set the rules.
[5:53:58] Sahneee: holy nerd
[5:54:00] Sahneee: WAYTOODANK
[5:54:04] PsychoBKilla: That was klingon
[5:54:06] Hummerino: but that 1 million dollars was owned by the IRS so now they are coming MONKERS
[5:54:08] Dragonmasterk: pathfinder 1e is something KEKW
[5:54:20] macrotoad: Take ten is taking ten min to take and auto 10 plus mods to the roll
[5:54:21] SniperNamedG: they talkin nerdanese
[5:54:27] InazumaYume: Fury had practice sitting in a bush when looking for Shinigami nikkisGiggle
[5:54:43] Shadowyc: Take 10 is, "I'm too lazy to roll." So you just use 10+Your Modifiers.
