[0:21:58] GigitySponges: What is this car like with a 99 turbo?
[0:22:31] NemisizZ: why would u fry shit?
[0:22:41] NemisizZ: thats kinda wierd Kappa
[0:22:50] ModelWrong: Don't overclock your PC for starters.
[0:23:05] Galileothe1: pc should turn off beforer temps go too high and kill ur cpu
[0:23:07] 911_raj: That's all because sewer or there is other reason
[0:23:13] 911_raj: Because of
[0:23:24] NemisizZ: u would have to be an uber clown to fry hardware now a days, theres so many failsafes build into it now a days
[0:23:25] Nightbot: IMGONNACUM
[0:23:37] Gladie209: people speculate about the assets and houses - all the shit inside nonstop loading etc.... but who knows
[0:24:01] NemisizZ: like cpu's dont fry anymore, they throttle, and then shut down before they get damaged, if they do get damaged its because its a faulty cpu to begin with
[0:24:15] NemisizZ: same goes for gpus
[0:24:26] NemisizZ: they just start to throttle down until it crashes
[0:24:53] Gladie209: so what happened to three people it started dopping fps to 60, next days to 30, next days to 10 untill its not playable anymore
[0:24:57] Gladie209: call it whatever you want
[0:25:13] Gladie209: they are not able to play on that cpu anymore

[0:29:13] NemisizZ: like i said before, its very unlikely for modern hardware to fry just like that
