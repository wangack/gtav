[3:20:49] PwnUWithEz: 4.0 already has a system for crafting where the more you craft the more you will get access to. Maybe you just have to craft a boat load of Average before u get Above Average

[3:22:31] KCUF_AM: i think they more want organized chaos rather than full on chaos
[3:22:42] CinoriThePriest: i think they genuinly want to slow down the money so we dont end up with people like in 3.0 who had like 10 billion a few months in but not no money
[3:22:58] Gh0stPog: but what happenes when it gets nurfed ?

[3:45:25] corratz: Ruth asked the other captains if they should vote to take control of the council

[3:45:37] corratz: noomnoom immediately went "wtf did she just say" LUL
[3:45:50] gamma_smash: he doesnt want the captains reviewing the points the officers get
[3:45:52] BitShifting: Timmac, whats your best moonshine now? are you down to the last wheel?
[3:45:53] 1pureevil: i think it was the lack of integrity on the captains on themselves with all the firings
[3:46:12] 6all: He was pissed that the PD is still dogshit after 2.5 months
[3:46:31] EpochCoda: i havn't been around for a bit did cornwood get axed or reinstated?
[3:46:32] Gh0stPog: i think just people telling him thr PD fuckup's and them fucking K coz he thinks CG as homies
[3:46:49] gamma_smash: he wants a commissioner
[3:46:55] corratz: as I understood it, his main concern was the chain of command
[3:47:10] 6all: no chain of command, 2 of the captains mia, dap system/points given out and reviewed by the same people, poor training etc

[3:47:24] auburnu2022: Yeah he wants someone to over look the cops like a comissioner
[3:47:27] Trippzy: Its more about no one owning up to the current unorder in the policeforce and that the captains are "ignoring" this as a problem
[3:48:11] Lepaca: when asked how he would fix it, his answer was to have someone else look into it. great solution timmacTU
[3:48:11] StreamElements: timmacTU
[3:48:16] nebujal: that current arc is great rp though, fun to watch what's going on with all that drama in the police
[3:48:23] auburnu2022: during the meeting, he said most cops when they are on duty, are afraid of messing up and getting reprmeanded for something so liute.
[3:48:28] 6all: poor retention of new officers, officers scared to do their job due to potential repercussions
[3:48:36] BigPurpin: im kinda out of the loop, but why did you make a new cop character?
[3:48:39] BitShifting: @Timmac, would you play cop within the current PD?
[3:48:49] Lepaca: red tape problem? add more/different red tape
[3:48:53] BitShifting: Would you want to*
[3:48:54] 6all: commission will be selected by the state and answers only to the state
[3:49:10] Krabby__Patty: wait what is thing with the pd can i get tldr?

[3:53:18] benb0mb: I mean look at those two cops that forgot to collect DNA so they went to the prison, beat the dude down, took his DNA, then tried paying him off lmao
[3:53:30] BloodTiger_: Yeah like its the whole ordeal with Cornwood right now. He's being accused of shooting 1 extra bullet during a shootout which caused the guy to die
[3:53:52] BloodTiger_: but then the autopsy came back saying that he died from a headshot and Cornwood stated that he only shot the guy in the chest
[3:53:55] 1biggoldfish: timmac for comish

[3:54:17] leo_bwo: The 1 bullet isnt even what killed him, lmfaooo
[3:54:17] corratz: @BloodTiger_ and in the metting with Max they actually said that the dude cornwood shot was unarmed
[3:54:58] Gh0stPog: and ofcourse when ur working 100 hrs you will make mistakes
[3:55:08] BloodTiger_: yeah its all a shit show right now
[3:55:12] DrCached: NODDERS Conan X Mac NODDERS High Command
[3:55:13] ittie: The bullet that killed him was a bullet to the head, cornwood shot the final shot in the chest, so murder how lol wild to me
[3:55:32] leo_bwo: Thats what Cornwood was saying, who ever works more hours is just screwed
[3:55:57] scotsman83: no it was to the head
[3:56:14] 6all: in the past when dealing with sbs one offs you could be way more lenient with the RP for content and not have repercussions

[3:58:53] krustymcdoogle: I think all of the pd rp is kinda scripted to some extent between a couple individuals hell maybe all of them
[3:58:54] BloodTiger_: Yeah there were like 6 cops mag dumping him and he shot 1 extra time KEKW
[3:59:01] ThiccEwok: I think most dislike Ruth
[3:59:01] EpochCoda: i mean i feel like this has created good rp but it could potentially really fuck some good rp up

[4:04:10] krustymcdoogle: Bobby and carmine are gonna run the prison possibly
[4:04:16] leo_bwo: 6 cops at 12 bullets each, plus 13 for Cornwoods heroics, an the dude has 5 bullet wounds an died from a headshot, when Cornwood shot in his chest. Just let the dude die an move on. Dude flew into the city 20-30 mins before he died LMFAOO

[4:10:06] leo_bwo: Definitely, they were HELLA strict on it

[4:10:32] leo_bwo: Not even CONSSIDERING old cops from before most of the time
[4:11:05] DrCached: I think it had to do with going from 300 players to 250 in the server and there not being much crime to do
[4:11:45] onlychainz: kills the rp to make ic progress for these positions

[6:52:48] TheTruffleShuffle: nice
[6:52:54] eddymm: so did we win?
[6:52:54] Yakuni01: did Gomer speedrun the moonshine ?
[6:53:16] TheTruffleShuffle: employ a runner?
[6:53:20] JoshKupka: and now you have a good system when they add a new patch NODDERS
[6:53:37] Gh0stPog: damn bruh 5-5.2 k with the current system in an hour more or less gg's
[6:53:54] Lordbidwell: She needs a sewer  we are champions my friends timmacHYPE
[6:54:15] dadjustchillin: does the formula continue to work with new stills when you replace them?
[6:54:18] Lordbidwell: wtf
[6:54:34] Snuskrobban: Look at them frogeyes
[6:54:46] Gh0stPog: till then run the shit in the ground
[6:55:22] gamma_smash: vinny is acting like cooking is better on the outside when the cops can easily come down in the sewers and catch so many people lol
[6:55:47] Boxed_Boxes: in b4 gomer effect
[6:56:02] SFGMOD: cops seen to not care what happens in the sewers
[6:56:34] T00SCHWIFTY: And half the people get lost lol
[6:56:44] Kkaedal: Biggest problem would be an informant, tell which still is which and charge everyone

[6:57:26] Lepaca: @Kkaedal objection: hearsay
[6:57:55] TheTruffleShuffle: more stills?
[6:57:59] TheKhanGreen: did you already start your cook?
[6:58:25] Kkaedal: @Lepaca Unless they come in and raid at an appropriate time
[6:58:48] TheKhanGreen: before 11:54 time stamped. roger
[6:59:09] Lepaca: @Kkaedal yup
[6:59:10] TheTruffleShuffle: 40 bottles per cook, average of 125 per bottle
[6:59:10] Kkaedal: A huge sewer raid would be cool to watch but the PD is in shambles, K alone put 4 in the hostipal yesterday
[6:59:25] Lepaca: must be something
[6:59:58] Lordbidwell: Cops would die not enough bandages
[7:00:05] GamerGoat007: Can you wash them in a washing machine maybe
[7:00:06] Kkaedal: sere*
[7:00:09] cmerk_: Maybe one of the vending machines down there?
[7:00:09] Kkaedal: see*
[7:00:26] kyanpeppaa: cops just ifak
[7:00:35] Kkaedal: They have Ifaks and a lot of them carry a lot of them
[7:00:45] NolandCT: So, no more surface world for you, only sewer pig?
[7:00:55] Kkaedal: The pennies are a new item you got today ?
[7:00:59] Lordbidwell: Would be hilarious watching them drop like flies
[7:01:21] Skrytinn: maybe you rurn them in at the coin excange and might be a "rare" penny that  worth some $$$
[7:01:51] Kkaedal: Pawn shop if they are "antique" coins
[7:01:58] NolandCT: I think he may be on to something with the currency down here though. It may have something to do with that to get better gloves or tools?
[7:01:58] TheTruffleShuffle: have you tried searching whilst on ‚Äòshine

[7:02:57] Kkaedal: Damn you're getting an item 90% of the time now
[7:03:05] spartacus1j: every stillman knows you batch better while sipping
[7:03:05] benb0mb: Yeah I've heard of the old timers use to put a penny in the still for some reason
[7:03:35] Lewz3k: VBUCKS
[7:03:38] Kkaedal: More reason to be in the sewers could be cool
[7:03:41] Kullen13: had to do with taste
[7:03:46] Gh0stPog: i think either for new still or new guy
[7:03:50] IIIIllIlll: 800% value Pog
[7:03:56] NolandCT: It's like in Runescape where you need gold nuggets for buying the prospector outfit to mine better.
[7:04:02] Kkaedal: Add it as an ingredient, 1st above average Pog
[7:04:06] dadjustchillin: thought Ellie said that contaminated it?
[7:04:10] Kullen13: The study I read said that copper had most benefit to the taste of the spirit in the strip run condenser and/or the spirit run pot
[7:04:12] MyDoSe_: @dadjustchillin She did
[7:04:43] Kkaedal: Wait top left, someone is called sumwan yuno ?
[7:05:19] TheKhanGreen: @timmac when you get the address on the bottles isn‚Äôt there another npc always at the front door of that house?
[7:05:22] NolandCT: Ha! Someone you know.
[7:05:59] BitShifting: Maybe the coins are like John Wick
[7:06:04] Kkaedal: @TheKhanGreen He just put the bottle at the door and cash comes out
[7:06:04] TheTruffleShuffle: maybe pennies make dirty water
[7:06:37] TheKhanGreen: @kkaedal before that where he gets the address to begin with
[7:07:15] Kkaedal: @TheKhanGreen Oh there is a moonshine NPC that take bottles and changes them to bottles with adresses

[7:08:04] GamerGoat007: Washing penny's probably give them more value
[7:08:10] hillbillymothman: Have you tried putting Penney in the still? Copper may bring up the purity. Since stills use copper piping
[7:08:18] TheKhanGreen: @kkaedal yeah I know I was asking if there‚Äôs always an npc always at the front of that house all the time too that can be interacted with or not
[7:08:43] Gh0stPog: i say normal wather and a penny
[7:09:08] IIIIllIlll: that would make the most sense imo
[7:09:09] Kkaedal: @TheKhanGreen What house ? i don't get your question. The moonshine NPC never leaves
[7:09:24] TheTruffleShuffle: maybe you have to change your recipe to add the penny to get higher proof
[7:09:35] wolfski36: Maybe when you leave a penny someone can take it later...... Kappa
[7:09:45] TheKhanGreen: @kkaedal the npc is behind a house
[7:09:50] ghostman16: what if normal water and a penny make dirty water in the still
[7:10:07] Kkaedal: @TheKhanGreen And there isn't any other NPCs around I believe
[7:10:19] Tzepe: might have to add or remove ingridients when adding the penny, when ellie did it she did the standard 3 3 3 6 and penny and it wouldnt let her start the brew
[7:10:28] highjayare: Was the sewer meth a real thing??
[7:10:31] TheKhanGreen: @kkaedal sometimes there‚Äôs some up front
[7:10:41] hillbillymothman: I also like the thought of there being a place to buy a better still for pennies.
[7:10:51] hillbillymothman: Or melt them done to make a still
[7:11:01] TheTruffleShuffle: I love this server in the early days
[7:11:01] Kkaedal: @TheKhanGreen I don't think it's related, could be wrong
[7:11:34] halos420: i think the better moonshine will come with better ingredients, wherever those may be from. sewer ingredients logically would be the limiter
[7:11:48] TheKhanGreen: @timmac maybe penny and water in the dryer at the house since it has two slots??
[7:12:02] BitShifting: Gomer living the farmer life up north
[7:12:06] BitShifting: yes please
[7:12:08] TheKhanGreen: for old water
[7:12:19] halos420: is there still the roadside fruiot stands?

[7:13:53] hillbillymothman: Hmmm
[7:14:04] Kkaedal: @TheKhanGreen @timmac this ?
[7:15:00] hillbillymothman: Lol
[7:15:04] hillbillymothman: Penny for a dollar
[7:15:12] TheKhanGreen: because the rolls take up one spot,most likely completely wrong tho
[7:15:18] GamerGoat007: Is corn the only vegetable available to use
[7:15:54] Tzepe: xx:54 someone said so that'll be xx:39? or close to it
[7:15:56] TheKhanGreen: a little before 12:39 I believe
[7:16:34] TheKhanGreen: I got distracted by you talking to Ellie and Vinny

[7:55:44] D4AprilFools: HOA for 6 years it was fun :D
[7:55:47] oldpro17: correct the code of the color. and it has to be one of the paint schemes already approved. but it also needs to be pre approved by the HOA
[7:55:47] Savage_WAR725: it can be the same color but a different shade of it
[7:55:52] Lepaca: he's going to leave very humbled. never fuck with the HOA LUL
