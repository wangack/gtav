[0:20:36] j3llybsnip3n: my dog eats everything
[0:20:37] MattarChawal: @sayeedblack Obv I’m not a vet but from a doctor’s perspective. Deffo sounds like constipation. Maybe he’s eaten something that’s undigestible/unusual. just observe for the next 24 hours since you said it’s already been a day. See if he’s displaying any other unusual behaviour, vomiting, excessive mucus/blood in stools/ hard bowrls etc. increase fluid intake and fiber for the time being
[0:20:49] TropicalToucan: ive never had an issue but ive had friends who dogs would eat random shit
[0:20:50] Gianister: Rice+Vegetables is the key @SayeedBlack
[0:20:51] planeswerecool: I've had it with a rabbit and chickens in the past. With them it can be deadly
[0:20:55] skeeter042: yeah, it can be, sometimes..  if they eat a sock or something for example
[0:20:59] hollywudsmkn_hogan: Dogs don't usually get constipated is the thing it's rare for dogs
[0:21:15] HarryFayTheShire: no milk
[0:21:20] HarryFayTheShire: no
[0:21:22] j3llybsnip3n: titty milk
[0:21:22] lorikchan: Let him eat grass
[0:21:27] planeswerecool: With dogs maybe not deadly. He might be fine
[0:21:32] Gianister: No no animals do not process the milk protein.
[0:21:33] HarryFayTheShire: scramble eggs and chicken
[0:21:43] charzak: dogs can usually work out their issues if it is minor.
[0:21:48] wardenau: where do u find grass????
