[11:22:37] macrotoad: Kinda do need a guild treasurer. Collect contribution and gamify contributing for them.

[11:29:19] rmcgowan: I kind of look at it this way. Mary now has a new bar when it comes to hiring. If people want access to parts and the back end, they NEED to first have a certain reputation. It does simplify a lot
[11:29:20] LayndShark: less people will be driveway mechanics

[11:29:40] TheWhiteWillow94: I mean it would work if the crafting discount worked
[11:29:40] AkuShin_: people are gonna do other jobs to tank rep if that’s how it works now
[11:29:57] Isen_Mage: charge based on % and base the charge on the worst mechanic price for part cost. So good mechanics take more of the pay home instead of spending it on parts
[11:29:58] itz_IMAN: run some g6 to lower rep to make more 5hed
[11:30:12] Shadowyc: peepoGiggles More money, but their parts supply don't last as long.

[11:30:37] L4zyb4ssturd: YAPPP "but when i look at it "
[11:30:38] rmcgowan: I look at it this way. In the short term it has become ESSENTIAL for the mechanics that are in the back end to be power leveled to the master mechanic level.
[11:30:39] mobius__0ne1: run away
[11:30:41] Seanisms: 'I know what im doing im a mechanic i can see the lights'

[11:31:02] ADStrike: Scuff queen
[11:31:13] rmcgowan: Like, grind grind grind to get Lionel to max rep
[11:31:20] Darkri19: it incentivies training people via mosleys for sure

[11:31:30] eborcurean: gonna see 50 people running mosleys jobs when this gets out
[11:31:31] lagunavex: Honestly the easy fix is you have to be a master mechanic to work on cars
[11:31:32] mobius__0ne1: meow
[11:31:33] dume5330: would need to be charged by % instead of parts
[11:31:42] SwagnificentTG: Every mechanic job should be done by a master mechanic and all of the master mechanics should be at Moseley/mary
[11:31:51] ch4mm_: wait fuck its 5am ono
[11:31:52] PsychoBKilla: nodd
[11:31:53] prozorftw: wait its 4am MONKA oh god
[11:31:55] mugcostanza: kyliebList
[11:32:01] illifis: Might need to charge as if you were a mid mechanic regardless and the better ones just pocket the extra money from using less parts
[11:32:13] Tronno: nodd
[11:32:13] footmunched: Lot of people running Mosley's tomorrow
[11:32:18] Fragger__23: if master mech repairs more, they also need to cost less per part.
[11:32:21] Jarathin: yeah you can fix more cars then others
[11:32:23] Trawls421: i think the percentage for crappy mechanics should be low
[11:32:27] Thefat16: feels like the design is as you become a better mechanic making your own parts uses less mats so you make more on1 part than an amateur mechanic with 2 but that incentivizes solo crafting
[11:32:27] killer90214: It should be fine once you get the proper cheaper parts that your exposed to have
[11:32:40] zaps6666: on paper its good but in prates its not as good
[11:32:42] spicychickenzz: hope the mechanic rep becomes more specialized
[11:32:43] Darkri19: i think rep gain for rusty might stick but not the other 2
[11:32:50] aluckynewb: maybe a basic price for repair and not parts
[11:32:56] captaincameron: it’s still probably cheaper for them if they supply their own materials. unless the percentage repair for them is really bad
[11:33:01] PsychoBKilla: 3Heading
[11:33:01] ibruticus: talkk
[11:33:08] rmcgowan: Short term, it's a pain point, but long term it just establishes the bar for "hiring". I don't see an actual issue with making applicants invest the time running Mosely's to get to Master Mechanic before they can be hired. People SHOULD be committed like that
[11:33:21] Teletonical: peepoHey Bwo! @kyliebitkin
[11:33:22] footmunched: I mean, this change effectively means a Master Mechanic requires less mats to repair a car

[12:17:36] storm_blessed_: s class tax
[12:17:37] itspacecowboy: Thanking about master to not master. a master can repair more cars in the long run, making more money than someone who can't, as they will run out of parts to repair the cars.  I thank this is going to be a very good change.
[12:17:37] Vadoctrax: The Premier will need to be taken out for special occassions now
[12:17:39] Marshall2: that makes sense to bring up costs for expensive cars
[12:17:39] BORAT_VERYNICE: sounds like the other mechanics are gonna need to get grinding mosely's
[12:17:40] Corvollo: So T3 trucks will need more parts than T1's if we apply that logic to the grinders?

[12:17:46] moboshobo: the increased mat cost for fancy vehicles is an interesting move
[12:17:47] rmcgowan: Also, being awake at tsunami to explain to the mechanics is important so they aren't confused or doing redundant science. The word of mouth matters
[12:17:52] Morningstarter: advanced repair items coming in the future
[12:17:52] BlightSpeaker26: If the car needs repair = car not working bug gets fixed you're gonna need lots of parts
[12:17:53] kessy1893: does that mean a non master mech will repair 2.5% on an S-class?
[12:17:54] aluckynewb: and benchs pump it 30 sec
