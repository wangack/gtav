[1:49:43] Kawllin: WiseGuy KEKL
[1:49:45] Erigzback: PLate lock is giving information on the vehicle being locked. Running the plate with a /runplate is showing info on the vehicle the fake plate came from.
[1:49:46] Kemli: The stolen plate ,when put on the new car, replaces the og car.type
[1:49:49] IrrationallyUbiquitous: Wiseguy is not locked in
[1:49:50] GTAWiseGuy: ahh

[1:49:54] Ketheptis: the man codes servers chat, he doesn't need to know how to clip KEKW
[1:49:54] DirtyDanFromDiscord: Hes saying the radar function shows different info than manually doing /runplate
[1:49:55] Ex_ar_Kun: Is the first one simply a log of the situation as the mk.1 eyeballs see it and then once its ran the plate comes back stollen
[1:49:55] TheSaltyPope: its giving him car info on the lock instead of the ACTUAL plate info
[1:49:56] i_am_beardman: it should be the same any way you run it
[1:49:59] TheMCA_Police: @D4rkkkk_ catKISS
[1:50:00] rest87: plate info = info about who registered / owns the plate, the car info = info about the actuall real car (vin)
[1:50:02] maijellies: it should've shown Granger for both runs
[1:50:02] Beenk: its giving the stolen car info
[1:50:05] AntiFusion: SusBusiness
[1:50:07] RobuTV: The stolen plate is not showing the info of the car that it was stolen from, but the info of the car that it is currently attached to. @GTAWiseGuy @Kyle
[1:50:11] Orinkai: you cant tell it's a stolen plate when you run it at the scene
[1:50:13] InedibleKirby: when you run on scene it should just be obviously stolem
[1:50:16] GTAWiseGuy: it seems like running it with the radar is telling you the car you're running rather than the vehicle it's registered to
[1:50:18] GTAWiseGuy: yeah I gotcha

[1:54:20] Slcko_: stuck KEKW
[1:54:25] Moephor: 1 I 00 SHIT
[1:54:26] rest87: but hmm, i think that it is correct actually. As the plate is registered to a car originaly and since it is stolen, they have taken it off and put it on a differetn car and it would show conflicting information
[1:54:28] deweycox29: If it was working right it should only come back to the granger
[1:54:36] Drivont: The radar is giving you the model of the actual car it's scanning. Comparing the model the radar gives vs the registered model is proof that it's the wrong plate.

[3:50:49] RektangleTV: i suspect they gate higher quality and like av1 encoding to a subbed viewer
[3:50:51] SYKOIZM: Amazon owns their hosting and makes up the pricing

[3:52:29] sydtast1c: @sarsar_the_smol yeah that's an opinion I guess. But YouTube has the Google algorithms behind it. Making it more ad friendly
[3:52:30] sterowentUS: @cabers01 but they don't do that, because it's a better negotiating point to say they aren't profitable

[4:38:06] Slesh5: this will be an interesting one -if the loitering charge drops I wonder if the shit that came after still stands
[4:38:07] Cobrian: Why would the identification request be unlawful if she could not be positively identified as a government worker and refused to provide any identification?
[4:38:14] sterowentUS: @OldMateIrate we'll see how competent the lawyers are about to be
[4:38:16] Tikiy3: i would be surprised
[4:38:16] feugr76: you got this og
[4:38:17] octodaddy: @Ninja I think you're right about that dude
[4:38:18] Spencer_Raid: You probably won't
[4:38:20] cliipd: im guessing no
[4:38:20] LaFleur_13: PEPW
[4:38:22] tacticalmixtape: oh you 100% got this
[4:38:22] dantilusthemantilus: the loitering will get thrown out but the failure to comply will stick
[4:38:22] CosmicDrain: stil fun
[4:38:24] BadHabitss: "idk if ill win this one" "im pretty sure this is 100% conviction rate"
[4:38:26] BasicallyLethargic: Yeah
[4:38:26] johnniep: bias PEPW
[4:38:27] Moephor: nope
[4:38:28] Timmo001: ID is a pretty easy one
[4:38:29] mlangcs: your RS on the loitering is flimsy
[4:38:29] abadbadman: does fruit of the poisonus tree work on this kyle?
[4:38:30] Seetherrr: SURELY KYLE WINS SURELY PEPW
[4:38:31] sterowentUS: depends on the lawyers
[4:38:31] Mega8bit: depends on the judge
[4:38:31] 000_____tab_enter_____000: PEPW

[4:38:32] AntiFusion: PEPW
[4:38:32] BasicallyLethargic: Ez W
[4:38:32] Scpoii: depends how you argue it, no?
[4:38:34] imploads: Loitering might get dropped but yeah
[4:38:37] Tikiy3: im looking forward to this
[4:38:37] 0ctember: my guess, loitering not guilty, failure to identify and resisting, guilty. interested to see
[4:38:38] ratpatrols: if they drop loitering then else is bs
[4:38:38] bread_winner_zo: ehhhhhhhh
[4:38:38] raldune: you might not get hte lottering but the rest seems good
[4:38:38] WhatsANamePrime: even if the loitering was wrong she would need to challenge that after not during
[4:38:39] Frakkles: I think the failure to identify is a slam dunk
[4:38:42] DromiTM: @sterowentUS don't walk back now boy
[4:38:44] bygoneflygon: you had a suspicion she was loitering, you couldnt know shes a govt employee until you id her EZ
[4:38:44] Mattieo0: you got this ( joever )
[4:38:45] tooterticket: wheres boolove when you need him
[4:38:46] Frakkles: BUT the way you got it?
[4:38:47] dantilusthemantilus: stone literally had an identical situation 2 days ago that went to bench
[4:38:51] feugr76: bambi still out getting food KEKL
[4:38:51] ThePurpleAxel: easy W og, no chance you lose
[4:38:53] OldMateIrate: @sterowentUS Dosent matter, He still had RS. Well just see who can articulate better
[4:38:55] Stuish101: I'm not sure you've got this one haha
[4:38:55] i_am_beardman: even if you werent able to cite her for loitering, she refused to id lol
[4:38:58] Cobrian: They don't know each other, there was no-one else providing proof, she flat out refused.
[4:39:00] KennedyFnPowers: I’ll always bet on Kyle in court, he’s full charisma/luck build
[4:39:02] mr_deepsense_: @ninja you so right about pred
[4:39:03] 0ctember: oh okay I see
[4:39:03] hmoob_jwah: 1000%
[4:39:08] IamLostinourRainbow: failure to comply
[4:39:10] boolove: it’s just disobeying or failure to comply yeah
[4:39:11] sterowentUS: @DromiTM PepeEvilplan i'll admit it when the verdict is made
[4:39:11] Tikiy3: close enough tho right
[4:39:15] Slesh5: true I guess he could argue he asked for ID to check if she is loitering or not
[4:39:22] K3fty: PEPW
[4:39:25] BigOgWayne: Resisting
[4:39:27] AnalogtoDigital: I love the RV just sitting in the lot KEKL
[4:39:28] trenchkidjayz: yup I always bet on Kyle. charisma/luck build
[4:39:28] petezuhfan: Fruit of the poisonous tree is only for evidence, not conduct. Not following lawful orders def on her
[4:39:31] robsmad: guilty until proves innocent Madge
[4:39:31] outboundtraveler: I think it’s pretty simple you told her to put her hands up and she decided to call someone pretty simple right there lol
[4:39:37] jaxkmurphy: also chat she is 100% going to want to be in the stand so it’s already gg
[4:39:39] abadbadman: GONNA LOSE TO A DMV BUBBLE KAREN NOOOO joever
[4:39:48] IamLostinourRainbow: I’d let her keep blabbering
[4:39:50] InvestmentDude: if it’s not a zoo and identity state then I think they are only required to provide id if they have committed or suspected of committing a crime
[4:39:52] Dyslexicshark: wrong that she failed to show id KEKW
[4:39:53] Erigzback: She could argue Loitering but arguing that on scene is not really how the law works.
[4:39:54] AnalogtoDigital: DO NOT LET THE DMV WIN ReallyMad
[4:39:58] IamLostinourRainbow: let her dig that hole
[4:39:59] i_am_beardman: that is why you're driving to a bench trial KEKW
[4:39:59] sterowentUS: @jaxkmurphy Aware
[4:40:00] InvestmentDude: stop* not zoo
[4:40:03] dantilusthemantilus: as long as pred reasonably believed she was loitering, the request for id was a bona fide lawful order so the failure to comply will 100% stick

[4:56:02] InvestmentDude: @drivont but Kyle said the stop was for failure to provide Id and not loitering
[4:56:03] Backwardman_: @Ohiosveryown He's arguing she wasn't on duty or working at the time
[4:56:06] TyJoRa: chat, is the attorney Simple Bill from NP? He sounds like him

[4:57:04] octodaddy: If I'm going to be honest with you. In my own humble opinion without being sentimental of course, without offending anyone who thinks differently from my own point of view, but also by looking into this matter in distinctive perspective, I would like to say I have nothing to say.
