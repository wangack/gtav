[1:31:36] TheSauceShaman: @TheSauceShaman yeah i like that too
[1:31:40] TheSauceShaman: the ONX culture is extremely fun
[1:32:08] TheSauceShaman: Alecks was talking about how he hates the divide between "serious vs silly" rp
[1:32:16] TheSauceShaman: and how he thinks it all exists together very well
[1:32:42] TheSauceShaman: and i think onx is doing that well so far
[1:32:55] bazzela: @TheSauceShaman Yeah exactly thats only dumb viewers that think comedy or humor = not serious
[1:33:24] pygmycolossus: agreed watching for lack of a better term " regular" people coming in contact with the insane characters on the servers are hilarious
[1:33:36] TheSauceShaman: @TheSauceShaman yeah, all the devs are on the right page and do a great job promoting that culture
[1:34:17] TheSauceShaman: @pygmycolossus i think the comedy term is "straight man", they're some of my favorite characters
[1:34:22] TheSauceShaman: bob is a classic example of that
[1:34:54] Chantastisch92: yeah the occasional trying to make the other laugh so hard they break character while dealing with actual serious rp is awesome
[1:35:02] pygmycolossus: @TheSauceShaman whos bob? i havent been making many of the rounds on the server i watch buff sam and joe pretty much
[1:35:28] TheSauceShaman: @TheSauceShaman Bob Smith is the police director, Buff is his Personal Assitant
[1:35:33] Allari: Oooooh spicy
[1:36:01] happyfunkittens: Hmm
[1:36:01] LateStar0: EVIL time to do a sting with asher
[1:36:05] Boredum_: @TheSauceShaman played by Alecks, ImmortalHD etc
[1:36:08] TheSauceShaman: @Chantastisch92 yeah its all so much funnier if its not over done
[1:36:21] pygmycolossus: @TheSauceShaman wait bob is a straight man? that doesnt seem right lol he seem just as wild as the rest of the pd
[1:36:44] TheSauceShaman: @TheSauceShaman i think that depends on how you'd define a "crazy character" tbh
[1:37:07] TheSauceShaman: like bob is funny as hell, but in a way that is more passive if that makes sense
[1:37:20] JackTheGnome: bob plays along a lot but his dry humor makes him almost straight man character
