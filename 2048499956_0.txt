[1:05:23] leydann: It's her fault confirmed
[1:05:30] davelecook: clown court and have ray mond as judge nakkiDerp
[1:05:35] JWuwee: I think it's best to hear from the leaders, not Juno. She's admitted she's bad at explaining things
[1:05:48] JWuwee: But... I get it... She's Tessa's friend
[1:05:55] thegrandgeneral3: Will she mention the Eve text trying to stop her from listening to Juno?
[1:06:55] KaiFulci: nakkiPopcorn
[1:06:55] jimothy64: Tessa has no reason to care beyond "people i care about are potentially hurting", everything else she's ready written off for herself. Even the money Eve is offering; that's a free bonus because Tessa already didn't expect to get it back

[1:09:47] JWuwee: @vipersummer nakkida said "if we want to be unbiased, we should talk to eve. If we want some spice (like Jay Que suggested) we should first talk to Juno"
[1:10:53] vipersummer: @JWuwee i meant Vito talk to Eve first before juno about Tessa leaving, not about this
[1:11:46] JWuwee: @vipersummer ohhh. Yeah ... I guess it's poor choices
[1:12:01] JWuwee: "exactly"
[1:12:54] JoeayIV: Vito understands Gladge

[1:16:42] Winston_Moriarty: Having seen both povs Vito and Eve were terrible comunicating with each other and the rest
[1:17:02] thegrandgeneral3: God if Tessa mentions Eve saying Juno would poison the well comment.
[1:17:30] Davis_the_Bozo: :)
[1:17:34] jimothy64: Honestly, Eve and Juno are kinda really similar but just different enough that they were probably destined to clash eventually

[3:41:08] owlicus: or a meatball
[3:41:12] owlicus: two different moods
[3:41:21] nobodybodon: Grilled cheese
[3:41:24] Rekonin: turkey, lettuce, mayo
[3:41:29] DJayEnzyme: @nobodybodon yup
[3:41:30] IIIIHELLIIII: Philly cheese steak
[3:41:51] nobodybodon: or prosciutto
[3:41:54] JoeayIV: now bonus question, if you do, what kind of side would you get with it
[3:41:58] JoeayIV: like a bag of chips
[3:42:02] JoeayIV: some soup
[3:42:11] Zubins: cuban
[3:42:20] nobodybodon: you said MAKE a sandwich and now you're adding sides Susge
[3:42:27] DJayEnzyme: @JoeayIV id take a grilled cheese with a side of grilled cheese
[3:42:28] JoeayIV: yes?
[3:42:37] JoeayIV: some people have more than one food in their house
[3:42:40] JoeayIV: and can make sides
[3:42:42] JoeayIV: ???
[3:42:59] nobodybodon: dawg if I make a sandwich I'm making one big enough that I don't need "sides"
[3:43:04] retrowolf0498: @joeayiv either a club style sandwich or a Chicken Bacon Ranch sandwich.
[3:43:07] Rekonin: Iono, maybe an apple, maybe a brownie
[3:43:23] JoeayIV: man its lookin like you're alone on that Bodon
[3:43:26] JoeayIV: people like sides
[3:43:42] JoeayIV: my family used to have these small bags of kettle cooked chips
[3:43:49] JoeayIV: i'd have one with every sandwich i made
[3:44:03] retrowolf0498: Sides are good but it depends on the main dish. A sandwich needs no sides.
[3:44:06] Rekonin: If I'm having something savory, I'm def having something with sweet alongside
[3:44:22] JoeayIV: yea or like a dessert
[3:44:33] nobodybodon: well a dessert isn't a side
[3:44:39] nobodybodon: nakkiMALD
[3:44:42] JoeayIV: it an adjacent food
[3:44:44] JoeayIV: to the main food
[3:44:47] nobodybodon: no, its a dessert
[3:44:58] nobodybodon: a side is eaten WITH the main, a dessert is eaten after
[3:45:02] Rekonin: a side is what I say it is
[3:45:14] JoeayIV: Bodon gatekeeping sides

[4:36:51] kelpklepto: @retrowolf0498 This is the way

[4:45:52] HahaNifty: she went there expecting to get berated, got berated, and decided to only give them the scraps anyway eeeh
[4:45:53] HallJams: everyone's at a loss but less of a loss than others
[4:46:55] nobodybodon: I think the real sticking point is selling the house BEFORE having that conversation and making everyone panic
[4:46:58] HahaNifty: i guess it was a "you think i'm a villain, so i'm gonna be a villain then" kinda situation
[4:47:20] x_easy_rider74_x: I just wonder if eve is avoiding everyone right now

[4:47:51] x_easy_rider74_x: oh ok thanks
[4:48:11] cat__supremacy: @x_easy_rider74_x, nah, she was around Sunday and Monday just sick today
[4:48:29] apairidox: Funny Ill bet they never attempted to settle anything with the group. washed they hands of it
[4:48:35] retrowolf0498: I've delt with migranes before so I know the feeling of not wanting to look at a screen all day with headphones on.
[4:49:02] x_easy_rider74_x: yeah migraines suck
[4:49:42] retrowolf0498: I'm usually up until twilight hours gaming with friends but if I have a migraine, I'll be off by 2am latest.
[4:50:06] LilMaGooby: This lack of communication is exactly why they broke up. People not reaching out is a pretty good indicator of disbanding being the right decision
[4:50:10] HahaNifty: wait they're still not intending to make the money back? ouchh
[4:50:33] cat__supremacy: @HahaNifty, no one has reached out. why would they?
[4:50:44] LilMaGooby: @hahanifty does it matter if nobody wants to have a civil discussion with any of them?
[4:50:56] dibahyy: I feel like with an apology about the house, a lot of the Italians would have forgiven them
[4:50:58] HallJams: but if it happened two days earlier that would be convenient
[4:51:32] retrowolf0498: Eve reached out to Tessa to repay her full cut because she knows that Tessa is understanding.
[4:51:50] TayG0: @cat__supremacy They said specifically that they weren't going to give them any more money, after Vito took Eve to the bank.
[4:52:03] dinoroaria: !whodies
[4:52:03] StreamElements: nakkiMega EVERYONE
[4:52:06] solowanderor: @HallJams i mean buying the house was 100% a this marriage is falling apart lets have a kid, kind of scenario
[4:52:24] retrowolf0498: @tayg0 because they essentially strong arm robbed her
[4:52:39] retrowolf0498: Before she had a chance to do or explain anything.
[4:53:03] evergreentyr: I also think Eve throwing in the towel.  Very much a "fine, you want me to be the bad guy, I'll be the bad guy eff you all" sort of move.
[4:53:03] btc718: the group was too big

[4:53:16] solowanderor: @cat__supremacy Vito was not going to pay out at all when they were just gonna keep it either
[4:53:31] sagesnojo: @retrowolf0498 eve should have not sold the house, before talking it over with vito and the family.
[4:53:40] btc718: they also kept adopting
[4:53:44] TayG0: I think that's ridiculous. She had plenty of opportunity to say 'Unfortunately I didn't get the full amount back from selling the house'. Even AFTER going to the bank.
[4:53:51] TayG0: @retrowolf0498
[4:53:57] cat__supremacy: @TayG0, she did say that
[4:54:04] Gigglesmctits: @TayG0 She did tell them.
[4:54:18] dibahyy: at the end after giving the money. not once during it
[4:54:20] sehpitt: @sagesnojo Sure, but from Eve's POV if vito didn't want to take any responsibility as a leader why would he deserve say as one
[4:54:36] retrowolf0498: And apparently they were told they were going to get the full amount but didn't.
[4:54:53] TayG0: @cat__supremacy @Gigglesmctits Not until AFTER handing over money, saying that is it, and deciding she wasn't going to give them anything else.
[4:55:19] TayG0: She saw an opportunity to VERY LOOSELY justify taking the larger cut, and screwing them over.
[4:55:31] retrowolf0498: Do you think she had the chance to talk until after? They kept berating her until she gave the money.
[4:55:32] apairidox: The problem is the house was in her name but she didnt have the right to sell it.
[4:55:44] evergreentyr: She felt betrayed, and acted from that space.  I'm surprised she gave them a dime.
[4:55:55] dibahyy: if anyone, cg, the company, any group sold a house and didn’t talk to all parties involved, anyone would be upset.
[4:56:19] TayG0: @retrowolf0498 I was watching homie. She had plenty of chance to explain that. She made a very poor, rash decision, and then didn't want to confront it.
[4:56:57] Jen848: nakkiCocoa
[4:57:06] TayG0: Even after breaking from the group, and heading to the bank, she could have explained. But she instead shut down and refused to work with them.
[4:57:08] evergreentyr: @dibahyy but if she decided to keep the house for themselves, people would have been mad too.
[4:57:09] dinoroaria: curvyeCozy
[4:57:27] kelpklepto: wasn'
[4:57:39] dibahyy: the problem isn’t about what the end goal is. it’s communicating with parties involved. they felt blindsided
[4:57:55] kelpklepto: wasnt it more so that Vitto was giving Tessa 2 weeks to reconsider leaving so thats why he wasnt going around saying she left?
[4:58:09] evergreentyr: @tayg0 we can all acknowledge she should have acted differently, but if anyone was put into her position- they might have responded in a similarly "middle fingerish" way.
[4:58:12] TayG0: @dibahyy Agreed
[4:58:24] nobodybodon: @kelpklepto NOPERS dont know where you got that from, when she was out he told her she had to be out out, and she agreed
[4:58:41] retrowolf0498: @kelpklepto no. He told her it was avone way door just like Lottie
[4:58:46] StreamElements: Feel free to join my Discord flock, 5000 members and growing! https://discordapp.com/invite/nakkida
[4:59:10] evergreentyr: She felt ambushed, targeted, and betrayed.  She was also convinced they were going to ocean dump her and Carlo right afterward.
[4:59:15] kelpklepto: hmm mustve misremembered that convo
[4:59:36] IosefSerov: nakkiSip
[5:00:07] Tatsuya_Blaze: you had to tell him youre sisters
[5:00:09] dibahyy: well I’m sure eve would be upset if someone else sold the house without letting her know. anyone would feel betrayed and angry. u honor ppls time and hard work.
[5:00:22] retrowolf0498: @kelpklepto it was the two week plan time frame that you're thinking of.
[5:01:05] retrowolf0498: So back when Luciano left.
[5:01:08] solowanderor: the only reason he still should have gone to eve 1st is she was `consigliere`
[5:01:15] TayG0: @evergreentyr I agree... to an extent. My confusion is with people who thinks this makes it justified.
[5:01:27] apairidox: But you can Fix him
[5:01:38] silverarrows47: Still spicy eh? yeeJay
[5:02:11] TayG0: It is understandable, to act in an impulsive way in that moment, but it was not justified, and she didn't try to fix the situation afterwards.
[5:02:17] TayG0: Agh, the whole situation sucks,.
[5:02:19] evergreentyr: @tayg0 mannn this is Los Santos.  Morality is hardly a thing in this universe lol!  We cant apply real life 'shoulds' to this world.
[5:02:27] stivelsee: @evergreentyr real
[5:02:58] solowanderor: @TayG0 there were a LOT of things that happened that were not justifiable, on both side
