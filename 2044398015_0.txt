[2:48:47] Aztec_Z4vepvp: u should try the caracara 4x4 i think its awd
[2:48:48] Just5abL: having lumber/money bags/weapons in pockets … brother
[2:48:50] Light1stNight: no shot a tow going there
[2:49:00] luckerooni: speedy fine your ass 10k for every 10 seconds late
[2:49:08] lahnzo: exactly you can carry so much in pockets and backpack, why are they going to get strict about using different car with trunk space
[2:49:16] stratz______: @Just5abL It would just look weird to see super cars chopping lumber in RP
[2:49:19] Laeret: nah hes saying its possible
[2:49:22] stratz______: It just doesn't look right
[2:49:27] Laeret: so shouldnt be wrong
[2:49:45] Just5abL: i mean people have a list of shiit in their pocket., car with wood ain’t that crazy lysO
[2:49:52] luvvkoa: uuh
[2:49:55] Just5abL: not your pocket
[2:50:05] lahnzo: they saying you have a bunch of stuff in pockets, why would they care about different car with trunk space

[2:50:59] luvvkoa: 1 wood pallet would make sense
[2:51:16] Light1stNight: it would make sense rp wise tho
[2:51:17] ZellDK: MONKA RP
[2:51:19] stratz______: Thats kinda true actually you could turn this car into like a rally type car
[2:51:23] stratz______: and it would make a little more sense
[2:51:25] ZellDK: wrong emote
[2:51:27] lahnzo: yall jeep bringing up rp'er of the year while mans did a bunch of barrel rolls and lost all his doors but kept driving. chill
[2:51:28] luckerooni: if theres a good truck like vehicle worth buying thats better than the lumber truck next time they come out with vehicles that might be W and lumber guys would probably buy it up early if someone else doesn't
[2:51:30] fin6erban6u: Lock pick that monster truck back there l o l
[2:51:35] luvvkoa: @ZellDK MONKA
[2:51:39] OrangesArePurple: I mean fitting a pallet in a sedan is already kinda weird. Feel like a SUV/crossover would be bare minimum
