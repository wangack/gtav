[7:08:42] if0rg0t2remember: what’s gonna happen when they do actual dangerous crimes
[7:09:18] samflamen: yeah not really, he'd just be in charge for road captain stuff
[7:10:10] doc_sharon: that would be good to straighten out NODDERS
[7:10:37] laxwall11: Yeah outside of direct road captain duties
[7:10:40] if0rg0t2remember: I thought one meeting they said it’s even unless directly related to their position
[7:10:45] A_Humble_Wooper: I think generally in gangs command only outrank each other in their designated area? In their own area they're above everyone except the pres and VP, and outside of that all of command are equal to each other? katesPlot
[7:10:50] doc_sharon: it's a good rule, it's just hard to know when the phone rings NODDERS

[7:12:15] abblepiewit: extra tiers feels extra messy.
[7:12:23] if0rg0t2remember: I’m glad Rue and Allie are opening up to Maxx but also reassuring her of her place

[7:14:29] doc_sharon: PeepoComfy we are chillin
[7:14:31] Insaif: I'll admit, this is why I was somewhat surprised that there was a command structure already in place beyond Pres and VP before the characters had a chance to develop.

[8:59:06] kangg: katesFlower
[8:59:11] KarnEvil: oh I for sure see Bev dying before spilling secrets.  mostly because of Dimoak's love of permaing his characters.

[9:02:43] IchibaToll: Sounds good overall for Bev - seems like it'll either be a "yes" today, or a "not today, but soon as long as people (Rue or whoever else) can get to know him better."

[9:05:31] Insaif: Yeah, it's completely fair and valid.
[9:05:38] IchibaToll: Agree, I'd much rather see her say "No," than feel forced into saying yes.
[9:05:51] zonerover: It's valid and saying No makes sense after what Rue said
[9:05:52] Insaif: She also wasn't a "never" sort of no.
[9:05:53] AziraphalesShop: You gonna put up Maeve yet?
[9:06:02] doc_sharon: I like that it will need to develop NODDERS
[9:06:04] if0rg0t2remember: it gets boring if every vote is always unanimous, so a good no once in a while is great
[9:06:22] laxwall11: Hopefully she spends some time with him in the next few weeks
[9:06:22] A_Humble_Wooper: Yeah, that was absolutely a "no right now" not a "no not ever" from Rue. Yesyes
