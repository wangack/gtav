[0:47:36] footmunched: Just buy at 6 per
[0:47:38] Vadoctrax: Even when materials returns, operates as though prices are still high so it's just barely under Rusty prices?
[0:47:40] Fr0stwav3: the solution is an inhouse sani crew KEKW thats the only long term solution to avoid this headache every time
[0:47:41] Omega16bit: Make it more profitable to sell to you than make circuit boards.
[0:47:44] CptApples: solution is to do grime for a couple of days
[0:47:46] kingcloudii: the real beef is with all the WoW gamers
[0:47:50] spicychickenzz: if you offer the sani workers higher than what Lang does wouldn't you get their mats ?

[0:49:26] Isen_Mage: the rusty parts are there as a fallback, so time to fallback on them
[0:49:37] MaffieNZ: if people have money for new cars, and for buying CBs, they can afford rusty prices
[0:49:43] Myki_Cameda: Do the rusty thing. Buy at 157, charge up to 213, gives upto 56$ per part service fee.
[0:49:48] dume5330: could be good to get ppl normalized to rusty prices
[0:49:51] lt_lieutenant: can the mayor be used at all?
[0:49:54] Matrix8369: what about eve and ash?
[0:49:56] PsychoBKilla: Yeah right now Ivan's runs are going into more butcoin stuff
[0:49:59] fraij: It's honestly not worth the effort for the amount of profit you getting compared to other things

[3:51:41] eborcurean: so is it a half order and hope to restock after seling/repairing cars?
[3:51:43] illifis: Hopefully Lang actually raises his buying price this time instead of just continuing to buy at the lowest price possible like last time
