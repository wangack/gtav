[6:34:05] ImMcGuirk: so delay that report a bit and gee him out before its fixed 4Head
[6:34:11] Dagarul: so we wait until that 30days for him is up.. then investigate
[6:34:16] Chritters: Jenny and Lovesick patrol time was some of my favorite bits of the last part of 3.0. I'd be so happy if he left and joined Jebby.
[6:34:22] Sufficate: i heard they have a x amount of hours they have to do if they wanna be in PD
[6:34:23] nikolegrnd: 100% very sad for the ones that enjoyed it
[6:34:34] filipe_vasconcellos_: @Chritters  NODDERS

[6:35:06] Dagarul: just remember if you do a ridealong during the investigation. just dont go with Suarez. hes going to try again.
[6:35:08] Tuckerbonage: When you have 3 cops that literally say they aren't happy at all and they are the first ones you see get on duty is sad
[6:35:10] minnmor: 10h per month is nothing in server like this

[6:38:29] jasonarce: I don't think all 3 captains didn't avg 10 hrs
[6:38:44] ThoughtfulWalrus: PD is a labour of love
[6:38:54] ThoughtfulWalrus: or hate in some cases LUL
[6:39:18] maraderi: Also, it's RP. It's a game. Why force people into certain roles for so many hours, unpaid

[6:40:38] Dagarul: in a way.. the cops are characters that are kinda forced to increase the RP of others who some are huge streamers..
[6:40:43] jasonarce: The money is IRL. That's the truth.
[6:41:01] maraderi: I didn't mean to belittle it, but you're right about the money aspect. I meant like it seeming very demanding
