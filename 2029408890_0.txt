[3:11:10] Mechz71: @esfandtv cornwood's first day on duty, someone told him what he should be carrying of you remeber
[3:11:10] improvisablex: @improvisablex I meant the PD in general. They need to be trained in articulating a crime and their tesimony. As soon as they forget or say something wrong then their believability goes away.

[3:12:07] Scottycky: ALLERGIES
[3:12:07] ArdentCause: Morton did say to the captains that they would take officers testimony in a higher regard- obviously cornwood doesnt know this

[3:12:35] unanimous_night: @420buttonmasher69 in theory they could IF the PD had bodycams issued to them and authorized for use
[3:12:39] lemunz2: @akaMattikins when they use body cam footage in court is there footage from an actual body cam they are wearing?
[3:12:40] akaMattikins: @EsfandTV we need that female officer and Jean Paul in the same room.

[6:10:46] Mac_Parts: In the UK, a TV licence is required to watch or record live TV on any channel and to use BBC iPlayer, regardless of the device. The fee funds BBC's services and is mandatory unless you only watch on-demand or catch-up shows on non-BBC platforms, or if you are over 75 and receive Pension Credit. Non-compliance can result in prosecution and a fine.

[8:50:32] Mac_Parts: A magazine is a spring-loaded device that holds and feeds ammunition into a firearm's chamber, and it can be either fixed or detachable. In contrast, a clip is a simpler mechanism that holds cartridges together for rapid loading, particularly in firearms with internal magazines. The terms are often confused but serve different purposes in the loading process, with magazines being more prevalent in modern firearms.

It knows this because it knows where it isn't, by subtracting where it is, from where it isn't, or where it isn't, from where it is, whichever is greater, it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance sub-system uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is, to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is.

[13:35:17] SacreDiablo: what about that combo
[13:35:18] SkyeReaper: I think it isn't your fault at all, an officer came on scene, said another office would come, you guys come coincidentally later on and have no idea about it.   A statement could've alreaady been taken, the situation was already handled by the first officer, what is the real issue?

[13:35:58] evee24_7: @esfandtv you did give him your number
[13:35:58] biffster42: Seems pretty realistic though. Everyone is sensitive and wants to critique cops over little things.
[13:35:59] iCarDog: @kuumaliimamies tf are you talking about? there are very few weirdos submitting reports over RP. They are so cringe
[13:36:01] erniejohnsonjr: @pacific0606 pepeW

[13:36:11] Kfoo_: Oh dude I think that was all in RP
[13:36:13] TheVinnyMan: I cant believe he went out of his way to report that
[13:36:13] PsychoJoker: Turner already said its fine you talked to him about it
[13:36:17] Toastbane: What happened?
[13:36:18] DeoNone: snr buns is leak when bogg quits it for the 20th time LULW
[13:36:18] sixoddeight: your partner said she doesnt see it cuz it came after her shift and you laughed about it before she brushed it off with that
[13:36:23] Rivath: was it an ooc complaint?
[13:36:23] TheKRT: @esfandtv need more hubs for food and hangouts on the map so senior buns ain‚Äôt packed

[13:36:28] OctaOcta42: its all RP.. people can't seperated Rp from IRL
[13:36:29] HowCanSheS1ap: he didnt report you to admins? what made it ooc?
[13:36:30] osrs_dog: @EsfandTV RAT HUNTER ARC!
[13:36:30] ONETRICKTOXIC: i mean he let it out in the report i guess
[13:36:31] tecnomancerx: oh yyeah if thats your issue then 100% it was just a miscommunication

[13:36:31] itzyoumanz: yet 90% of people have a fat joke or fat insult about ya
[13:36:33] Whistlebeak: Smadge
[13:36:33] Xen_Crypt: i think the best way to take it is the other guy is just RPing being pissed and an excuse/in to apply to PD
[13:36:33] lil_baconator: pd meeting
[13:36:34] MrKiwiGaming: it might just be him complaining in RP, not actually feeling disrespected
[13:36:35] ZohanAvi: not going to the meeting ??
[13:36:35] ArdentCause: lol parking lot
[13:36:36] CodeEditor: I think there needs to be more restaurants so everyone isn't congregating

[13:36:38] jjformvp25: what happened to poki?
[13:36:38] Kaboomtheory: is it ooc though, seems like his character was just annoyed that a stabbing was being blown off
[13:36:39] Shmoopee: misunderstandings
[13:36:40] MrActivated: people just want attention
[13:36:41] catloyalist: It's RP I don't think it's real feelings

[13:36:44] Phazedlife: Why did you spawn up here lol
[13:36:44] nosticktoaster: wait whos ooc mad
[13:36:46] StephyFace: i mean the responding officer should have followed up, imo it should go back to them. ppl in rp should also understand ya'll have tons goin on IC b/c of lack of cops
[13:36:46] M__Wolfe: He rped it though? Or you think the complaint was ooc

[13:36:47] mightyjoshy: Mohammed More houses of. More houses are going to be accessible in gta 6.
[13:36:47] SkyMason21: @EsfandTV i dont think he felt bad, he applied for the pd with those reports too
[13:36:47] The_Hillsman: @EsfandTV Normal rp feeling is to feel like that. You're gonna have a lot of those people even if it's not the intention
[13:36:48] raklesun: i get that people just can't talk shit out
[13:36:49] bluzi91: Who had a problem with you?
[13:36:49] evilmoose__: @esfandtv That happens in IRL when you get written up for complaints from clients.
[13:36:50] PKBeau: that's the gripes of being a nice person
