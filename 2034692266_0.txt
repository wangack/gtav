[1:33:00] A_Humble_Wooper: @mister_nibbles yep!
[1:33:04] StarDebris91: I wanna say I read philips screws were designed for assembly line use. Its design prevents assemblers from over-tightening, so it requires a lower skill level to operate. Terrible for removing
[1:33:14] doc_sharon: they've been very up front Yesyes
[1:33:22] if0rg0t2remember: so Philips screw was designed with the opposite intention of a lot of fasteners. Most are to provide the most torque, Philips is designed to save the surface it is screwing into
[1:33:34] Insaif: Chip's been a solid homie from the first meeting. He's also the one that sent the dude over to help on Maxx and Rue's first tow job that went to hell.

[4:50:34] mister_nibbles: potential reminder for gas tho, you said you wanted to earlier
[4:50:49] Insaif: Are they pushing on Sani for mats for the computer, maybe?
[4:50:51] abblepiewit: Like, if we can't have Taylor or Wade doing these, Maxx is a good shout.
[4:50:57] Kthanid: It's just a big money maker "for the club" just not for persons.
[4:51:05] rickbuh: Sani should be a not Hangaround job

[4:51:20] Nightbot: Follow Kate on Instagram! instagram.com/kate.ttv
[4:51:23] doc_sharon: that suuuuuuucks
[4:51:29] mister_nibbles: running sani should lower dues or something NODDERS
[4:51:31] Insaif: Yeah, it's not great, especially if you have rep as low as Maxx's
[4:51:39] if0rg0t2remember: and one of the issues is YES the club gets a lot of cash from selling mats from Sani, but it tanks your tow rep and you still owe dues and it doesn't pay those
[4:51:48] doc_sharon: the club relies on sani too much, I think
[4:51:49] ThomasTheDestroyer: Yeah, it will get you the mats to build the computer, but you still have to buy the blueprints, I assume.
[4:51:50] Crazith: a pure G6 runner would fund a lot

[4:52:47] minusxero: That scared me lol
[4:53:02] rekadsli: what did our rep with the weed guy do after the run or have we not checked yet?
[4:53:04] Count_Nodonora: The original idea of each of you having a specialty was so good. Heck Buddha even said so during the original trailer tea sesh. When they just came back and said "nope, everybody runs sani" I just went huh?
[4:53:58] kangg: katesSteer
[4:53:59] firefrye: @Count_Nodonora This. if one job tanks rep with another, it makes no sense unless the whole club ONLY does that job
[4:54:06] ThomasTheDestroyer: Spreading the jobs makes everyone money. Hammering Sani makes the club money via the mats market.
[4:54:06] paullt2: You're earning a reputation as a driver
[4:54:14] AshuraX13: Maxx's rep is the friends she makes along the way Yesyes
[4:54:28] aer1als: the club is getting good money from materials, just individuals dont make much
[4:54:34] NoodleCubed: has anyone actually done the math on sani? because I find it hard to believe it makes better money than 4 people doing tow, unless the mats are sold for 10+
[4:54:38] samflamen: The rep thing is more because Lane and Wade want to get as high as they can, see where and what it gets them, but also have a few other club members that can get high enough for recyclables
[4:54:49] Kthanid: Also once the BIG club expenses are out of the way, things might change up with money making.
[4:54:51] Crazith: I think too many people are doing sani
[4:55:09] KarnEvil: yeah, if you don't get a cut of the mats, it is not very good payout.
[4:55:11] doc_sharon: the club makes most of the money from sani, but the club is also not paying for food, gas, clothes,etc.  So they need to be able to make money at other jobs Yesyes
[4:55:18] A_Humble_Wooper: Heh
[4:55:22] mohler_47: it also halts progress towards any other reps
[4:55:23] if0rg0t2remember: people already have such fancy stuff wow

[5:00:24] TheRealZed11: would be nice if there was a hang around or two to do sani so other members could make money. doesn’t make a lot of sense to have 4 patches doing grunt work. imho.
[5:00:53] Kthanid: @TheRealZed11 I mean currently they don't HAVE those, but yes that'd be prospect work in future.

[6:18:17] 4taog: yeah, the last several months of Nancy was paranoid Lang and gang attacks. always alert.
[6:18:44] mister_nibbles: is Lane talking to Bev?  katesGiggle
[6:19:01] IchibaToll: Hopefully people learn.  And that learning may be from some L's, but that's the way it goes.
[6:19:01] aer1als: lang, the paranoia king
[6:19:08] AshuraX13: Being BBMC adjacent helped too. Especially Collin
[6:19:11] Insaif: Between Lang and the BBMC, you have a lot more practice in being aware of and prepped for things like that.
[6:19:14] firefrye: And you picked up a lot from Colin and the BBMC
[6:19:20] MyNameisTiff_: Situational awareness is a good skill to have.
[6:19:28] rickbuh: And with Wade watching the truck, he should have been ready
[6:19:31] Crafty_Crystal: Even the Stable was protective of their stuff because it’s all they had.
[6:19:45] if0rg0t2remember: you bring over the Nicolas OPSEC Simone awareness too

[6:20:20] if0rg0t2remember: @VTMonster truly the important part
[6:20:20] AshuraX13: Just noting things that need work in the future
[6:20:22] itGlenn: Yesyes

[6:21:06] Kthanid: You have many years of group crime experience, which is just how it is.
[6:21:11] Crafty_Crystal: I think it’s just your instincts because it’s been there from the beginning on all characters.

[6:24:05] doc_sharon: I think as the Raiders get into more criminal jobs, like chop and stuff, they will get better at all this katesLuck
[6:24:23] Kthanid: It's a good way to allow for the player knowing things like driving, or shooting etc.
[6:24:34] hecktobreakfast: How did Maxx meet up with the Raiders crew? Is that something we know?
[6:24:40] extractionss25: was sick for like a week and then got busy with work. nice little break from watching RP but slowly catching up on streams

[6:29:46] IchibaToll: How long is the meeting intended to last?
[6:29:50] Immortal_Sin: going to bed at like 3 and 4
[6:29:51] Immortal_Sin: or
[6:29:54] metalmaster29: Do whatever you want. We'll be here regardless.
[6:29:55] Crafty_Crystal: either way sucks
[6:29:56] KarnEvil: neither is a good idea tbf
[6:29:58] TheRealZed11: depends if your alarm will wake you up for 5.
[6:29:58] GenuineMind: both options suck
[6:29:58] IchibaToll: Oof
[6:30:03] Kthanid: That personally, seems like a poor idea.
[6:30:04] Insaif: Staying up is always so much more difficult than people expect. katesHUg
[6:30:05] mister_nibbles: tbh both of those options sound awful

[6:30:06] VTMonster: Honestly I live on the East Coast and I don't plan on being up at 8am EST
[6:30:06] AntiochChouteau: Just seems so not fair.
[6:30:09] AshuraX13: Both suck, but I would try for some sleep
[6:30:16] IchibaToll: katesSmile
[6:30:18] KillerK0605: I won’t wake up to alarms unless I have enough sleep and I have to wake up at 6 est
[6:30:19] KarnEvil: kinda stinky on them to make it at 8am knowing you're on the west coast.
[6:30:20] MyNameisTiff_: Which would mess up your sleep schedule more? Nap or all-nighter?
[6:30:21] hecktobreakfast: Illegal
[6:30:28] snooze__button: my other problem with appointments that early: do I have coffee?
[6:30:44] gnu_user: 6 is doable
[6:30:48] GenuineMind: id nap. like, call it now, go bedge
[6:30:50] Kthanid: Better a split sleep than no sleep at all.
[6:30:55] doc_sharon: when you take your accidental naps after stream, do you feel better after a little sleep?  if so, then do that
[6:30:57] tresbizarre: Are they used to dealing with creatives? Do they understand timezones?

[6:31:52] hecktobreakfast: @4taog Secret Project is puppies. But new email thing might be kittens.
[6:31:59] KillerK0605: Redbull and Prayers has saved me so many times

[7:49:29] Carbonfated: hank is luke warm
[7:49:34] Alteritus: does the soup not structurally compromise the bread?
[7:49:50] doc_sharon: I thought Rue had knees like Megan KEKW
[7:50:16] hecktobreakfast: DONOTCUM ?
[7:50:34] IchibaToll: If the bread bowl is made properly, it has a firm exterior, so it holds its structure.
[7:50:46] firefrye: @Alteritus breadbowls have a thick crust that's quite sturdy. But the inside soaks the soup up and is amazing
[7:50:55] AshuraX13: I want some white turkey chili in a bread bowl

[7:58:09] abblepiewit: @YinGSamurai1 it's been forever since Maxx has done G6, so probably not surprising Kate and many of us don't remember that. (And I think the pairing was Maxx/Wade, so Maxx wouldn't have interacted with Hank much even then.)
[7:58:27] Jorsh029: "do you ever get the urge to write your name on wet cement?"
