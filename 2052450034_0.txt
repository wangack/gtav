[1:50:16] nobodybodon: KEKW
[1:50:29] TheJRoller: from the losers
[1:50:32] jimothy64: Using odds makes it easier for the house to win.
[1:50:38] ThatSoKyuRo: Tessa best bet maybe ask mr k LUL
[1:50:54] TheJRoller: use your people to run it
[1:50:59] QuesoCommander: I recommend the twitch prediction method
[1:51:07] jimothy64: If a horse has 2:1 odds, the winner is paid double what they put in.
[1:51:14] TheDowntownRoyaltyBand: sounds crazy but ask Chat GPT
[1:51:26] IIIIHELLIIII: The house usually takes their cut off the overall bets placed
[1:51:32] jimothy64: So if I bet 50 on a horse with 2:1 odds, I get 100 if that horse wins
[1:52:03] TheJRoller: the house loses that day
[1:52:03] Funkypants: The odds is based on the bets, not what you set
[1:52:07] IosefSerov: Then you're a broke bank lol
[1:52:14] TheJRoller: but you win the next race
[1:52:17] Cambellar: the more liekely a horse is to win the closer to a 1 to 1 the bet gets
[1:52:17] nobodybodon: You take a % of the total, they get whatever is left?
[1:52:30] jimothy64: Odds get narrower with more bets. The favourites always have the lowest margin
[1:52:31] TheJRoller: you need an edge somehow
[1:52:33] nobodybodon: thats the point, you get less payout if you bet the same as everyone else
[1:52:34] QuesoCommander: that only works with calculated odds
[1:52:41] QuesoCommander: which is a mess
[1:52:48] 80sHairMetalFan: This is why I never gamble
[1:52:51] nobodybodon: you're not doubling if you bet 20k on a horse with 100k already on it
[1:52:52] HCmodeEngaged: If a bunch of people bet on the same then that horse becomes a favorite
[1:52:54] IosefSerov: Just hire a bookie
[1:52:55] icecreamcats: by having more then one horse
[1:53:09] nobodybodon: Take the total bets, you take a %, the remainder is spread proportionally on whoever bet on the winner
[1:53:11] davelecook: why do I have a peaky blinders vibes for the betting ? nakkiDerp
[1:53:15] nobodybodon: thats the simplest version
[1:53:17] IosefSerov: Just have Mr. K run it lol
[1:53:18] TheJRoller: thats someone elses business
[1:53:19] Mitashkii: everyone running G6 NotLikeThis
[1:53:25] QuesoCommander: yeah what bodon said nodd
[1:53:29] TheJRoller: you just provide the venue and service
[1:53:37] tfw_badfeel: 10 people in for 1k each, they bet on horses, 2 are right, they get 90% of the total aka 4500 each, you get 1000... maybe?
[1:53:43] Funkypants: 5 people place bets: total the bets into winning vs losing, that's the odds. if people put up $500 saying the horse wins, $1000 saying the horse loses, it's 2:1 against the horse - minus the house cut
[1:53:43] TheJRoller: more rp for more people
[1:53:58] rave_iz_here: hallo everyone

[1:54:59] IosefSerov: I guess he would probably scamaz ya...
[1:55:02] TheJRoller: for your service
[1:55:06] jimothy64: It's one of those things that's like, super simple once you get it, but super hard to explain simply lol
[1:55:09] ThatSoKyuRo: have someone teach you then
[1:55:09] doctorawesomus: so the worse people think a horse will do, the higher the odds, and thus the potential payout if that horse wins
[1:55:10] nobodybodon: DESKCHAN I gave you the simplest version and you chose to read a more complicated one
[1:55:40] IosefSerov: Yeah that works.
[1:55:48] QuesoCommander: that's the fairest way to do it
[1:55:49] IosefSerov: Not if they know how it works
[1:55:51] nobodybodon: well yes, because its money.
[1:55:55] TheJRoller: as long as they get more then they put in yeah
[1:55:59] TheJRoller: it works
[1:56:01] IosefSerov: but yeah someone will always get butthurt
[1:56:02] doctorawesomus: the problem is that no one will know who to set initial odds on, because no one knows what makes a great hobby horse jockey :D
[1:56:05] nobodybodon: but its also encouraging people to spread out their bets
[1:56:15] IosefSerov: it's betting that's inherent
[1:56:17] nobodybodon: if everyone bets on one 'horse' they wont get much back
[1:56:58] nobodybodon: as long as you tell people what the bets are (anonymously) then they'll know which horse has the best return if it wins
[1:57:08] jointspecialist: remember the death roll Tessa won, similar concept
[1:57:09] nobodybodon: Think twitch predictions
[1:57:09] ThatSoKyuRo: just have the clowns teach you how to gamble it be bonding LUL
[1:57:11] IosefSerov: They won't get much back because that payout is spread among all those people.
[1:57:12] jimothy64: Which is also *basically* how odds work, they just have an extra layer of maths on top of that
[1:57:19] doctorawesomus: yeah, popular bets are safe bets and thus don’t pay off big
[1:57:52] nobodybodon: (i'm gonna roll a d4)
[1:58:00] CrisKross99: oh true. like if a bunch of people bet on one, it's split evenly among ALL of them so their individual amounts are smaller.
[1:58:29] nobodybodon: see how twitch does it? you get all your points back + a % of all the other points spent, in the case of your horse race you just take a % before you give the winnings NODDERS

[2:00:09] TheDowntownRoyaltyBand: each person gets to choose and bet on whatever horse they choose. don’t worry about odds, and over complicating things.
[2:00:14] jimothy64: Roll dice for the pedigree "stats"
[2:01:11] TheDowntownRoyaltyBand: essentially betting 1k for a 5k return for first second 2k third 1k. You make 2k each race.
[2:01:12] nobodybodon: the problem with all that, is its GTAV and everyone runs at the same pace (depending on the walk style)
[2:01:20] IosefSerov: "Sports!" Yeah... nakkiBlele
[2:01:21] nobodybodon: so you can't really do "odds" like that

[2:08:59] Thatgooey: assign odds after people place bets maybe?

[2:11:01] DJayEnzyme: @nobodybodon i guess you could set up some test races and just do trials to see which wins more
[2:11:01] nobodybodon: obv fastest = lowest payout, but  the range

[2:14:53] icecreamcats: roll on what run you get -> bet on who got what -> unfair odd but fair game -> house wins?
[2:15:43] doctorawesomus: also if you drug some of the other horses, you can reduce the number of betting combos and scam ‘em that way!
[2:16:20] nobodybodon: could have em roll for injuries or something KEKW
[2:16:24] nobodybodon: force them to get a new horse
[2:16:47] nobodybodon: thats actually gold
[2:17:02] icecreamcats: service fee
[2:17:09] kmorrison4403: exactly what he said
[2:17:17] nobodybodon: horse determines run style, but the jockey still matters since they're the ones picking their "race lines" and jumping hurdles
[2:17:20] nobodybodon: hmjj
[2:17:26] kmorrison4403: no it’s not scummy, it’s your pay for making an event for them.
[2:17:41] IosefSerov: Wants to do betting but isn't a scammer... nakkiFP
[2:18:06] nobodybodon: yeah you gotta make peace with the fact that all betting is a scam.
[2:18:19] icecreamcats: “door fee”
[2:18:40] nys006: Start off with slow run styles, next event they can "buy"(horsie) a better run style
[2:18:48] IosefSerov: No right way there will be losers nakkiShrug
[2:19:05] QuesoCommander: that's why the pooling method is foolproof
[2:19:38] QuesoCommander: it can even encourage fixing, because the house makes money the more that people bet regardless of the result

[2:19:48] jimothy64: I like the idea of the horses having a set run style on purchase though.. its mostly separate to the betting/profit concerns but it does encourage people buying multiple horses
[2:20:02] apairidox: you take 10% of the total amount taken in the winner gets the rest
[2:20:57] IosefSerov: Queue Tessa asking the manufacturer for frangible horses kekw
[2:21:36] nys006: umm maybe you can gacha system the horses? so 500$ for a horse and they "roll" for a style, they can get unlucky
[2:21:46] IosefSerov: Wait, exploding horses? 🤔
[2:22:16] reckless_gm: Maybe change the run on how old/worn the horse is? So the older horses may be slower, and people would want to get newer ones.

[9:32:32] Chiracho: i had such high hoped for 76 and betheseda really screwed the pooch
[9:32:33] HARMSwahy: I really enjoyed starfield. It was missing that special something that makes it a forever game like skyrim but I enjoyed my playthrough.
[9:33:03] Yerbamate86: Mass effect andromeda kill my hype for any video game lol
[9:33:05] Yerbamate86: killed
[9:33:25] retrowolf0498: It was another overhyped game like Fallout 76 was. They thought they had more than they did
[9:33:27] JoeayIV: BG3?
[9:33:28] Brumorin: surrounded by games like cyberpunk and bg3 starfield just felt hollow
[9:33:28] Selosya: BG3?

[9:35:00] molotov_michelle: I've played d&d for over a decade now so bg3 was amazing for me
[9:35:07] retrowolf0498: And sometimes it ends up with a trip to the hospital
[9:35:51] Jen848: @Yerbamate86 The part where the one chick says her face is tired just cracks me up to no end
[9:36:08] retrowolf0498: Seatbelt before you go flying through the windshield?

[9:49:01] JoeayIV: the unarmed child in front of burgershot i'll never forget
[9:51:45] JoeayIV: if you want a refresher, moosbeard and i think brick were shooting around the kid, Tessa took that as we are shooting this kid
[9:51:48] JoeayIV: and shot him
[9:52:16] JoeayIV: and i think they swept it under the rug
[9:52:48] molotov_michelle: Phew I thought so too
[9:53:15] JoeayIV: they fucking asked Tessa why she shot him and her response was just "you were shooting him too" OMEGALAUGHING
[9:54:20] JoeayIV: that along with the french man she shot i think are the funniest kills
[9:54:26] muffinplaysgames: Is tessa limping now because of a new thing or is it the thing a few days ago still? XD
[9:54:54] muffinplaysgames: If you said it was a new thing I would beilieve you XD
[9:55:06] molotov_michelle: nakkiBooboo
[9:55:08] retrowolf0498: People love randomly punching her in the chest
[9:55:15] Jen848: multiple things have happened to keep her injured lol
[9:55:33] Chiracho: that sounded like the most defeated "hello" KEKW
[9:55:38] muffinplaysgames: Tessa gives a new meaning to Perma. Perma injured XD
[9:55:39] talon76767: shes unkillable
[9:55:44] retrowolf0498: Standing on the back of the garbage truck yesterday wasn't such a good idea
[9:55:54] molotov_michelle: Dont jinx her
[9:56:29] muffinplaysgames: Hahaha
[9:56:33] Jen848: Think about it like what?

[9:56:39] retrowolf0498: And I think he got hit by something?
[9:57:00] Chiracho: ngl my first guess was got shot again selling weed
[9:57:19] retrowolf0498: My thought was getting bowled over by a local
[9:57:38] Chiracho: oh god...

[9:59:12] retrowolf0498: I think @JoeayIV is right. ICU might be the only way to end this week of being injured
[9:59:27] muffinplaysgames: probably not. He doesnt have the balls to rob someone XD
