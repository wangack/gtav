[0:06:46] Drackaine: @EsfandTV On yesterday's DivaJilly's vod Crane, Max, Malton etc had a really in-depth conversation about the PD issues, since you are so invested I'd say its a good idea to have a look, from about 10:50:00 to 30-40 mins after the disconnect on the "short" last vod. It might help you with perspective so you dont get frustrated ooc.

[1:02:51] Citystar619: Seems like the best way to.not get daps is not doing police work
[1:02:55] Pee_aRe: yes
[1:02:55] Erohw666: I've RP'd since 2018... It's always been 1 min = 1 month
[1:02:55] Diamondman121314: yeah, Moon made the example that you can't have a 25 year old who just did 60 years in prison, doesn't make sense
[1:02:56] NoBananaSuits: it also wouldn't make sense when theyd go for "9 months" but then a "24 hour hold" lol
[1:02:56] CookiesOnDowels: Madge No Time Served

[1:03:19] ChaoticSanity: instead they get super slushies
[1:03:21] Gigass: prison is failed so many times no hope with prison rp
[1:03:21] chucksame: yeah i was watching old clips and people like actually spent time in jail before>
[1:03:21] Rixxey: prison should be a place not just 5 minutes alone

[1:03:29] SurelyBaked: frfr drip or drown cuh
[1:03:30] ZachFromChat: people argue for 2 hours about 12 minutes.. prison RP never LULW they avoid it like the plague
[1:03:30] Booyal: Prison RP going to be great soon with Cranes changes @EsfandTV
[1:03:32] mcknizzle90: PD was going around asking about VR lapdances haha
[1:03:32] cwasrightt: Doc sorry
[1:03:32] combattingjosh: @cwasrightt prison fucked KEKW
[1:03:32] RobRoads: I remember, Bobby saying if he got 15 years he'd be out for 15 days streaming gta. so 12 months isn't 1 year. 1 year is a day and 12 months is 12 min
[1:03:33] Kalious78: prison time need huge increase,  1 hour per month isnt out of reason
[1:03:36] complexlalo: then if you kill a cop your crime is 20 minutes lmao
[1:03:38] Kevz95: NODDERS

[1:03:45] Kalious78: 50month sentence is only 2 days
[1:03:45] DaltonIRL: @esfandtv crims can get record expunged now one time only for 100k
[1:03:48] ChaoticSanity: itsnt that part of the RP though
[1:03:48] thewookie34: only thing that happened was like a 1 hour chase and some random other officer who never get on cried you get more info then other officers
[1:03:48] quaylewastaken: drip act is fascism
[1:03:48] marshmellowxiii: better prison RP is in the works, let them cook.

[1:05:30] SarahFlare: But to pass legislation for dumb people....really?
[1:05:31] Sathure: I think they should work on Prison Gameplay and make the sentences longer. Seems like everything is a slap on the wrist in terms of time but a much larger financial burden.

[1:06:02] Kalious78: @Erohw666 hardly, get a warden n few prisoners all together serving time its good "content" and even a 50month sntence is 2 days. might be shit for the 1st 1 or 2 people til it fills up but 10minutes for stabbing 20 people in snr buns isnt even worth the paperwork
[1:06:02] n0oxaskek: @EsfandTV what do you think of raising it a little? like 1 month = 5 minutes
[1:06:02] Meditati0n: in the start you explained the times to chat almost everytime you charged someone, so ye we were confused

[1:06:09] ihhunt3r: thats actually hillarious
[1:06:09] PAID_ACTOR1: i dont think anyone mistakes it for month more than 5 minutes into watching any jail stream
[1:06:09] DinoFromXbox: takes more time to process than to serve
[1:06:10] Republic_of_texas: kill the mayor, kidnap a cop, hijack gruppe 6, 10 hostages, actually get caught, 30 minute time out that’s suspended for time served because the lawyer wasted time
[1:06:10] thesnorlaxhep: Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 do you know what the key trick is?  do you think it’s power gaming?  civ gang does it to prevent being robbed.  I think it’s an exploit and wondered what you thought.

[2:10:36] b2a80: @minich4rmander They have very elaborate plans,  it's not really the driving getting them out of it.  It's the smart plans and spots they use.
[2:10:36] Bushwick78: LMAO
[2:10:37] combattingjosh: @Bearcat_77 That was the whole idea of the public server. Some have been given prio, but that was 3.0.
[2:10:37] Renshaaka: @jigguio not gonna drag a bunch of people. but the RP quality is pretty low from a lot of streamers.
[2:10:38] supaiiii: xdd

[2:10:54] Crazyoldfool: I like what Blau said in the podcast. NP releases a statement saying that crims need to start giving more Ls to the cops, and then they need to crack down on people who refuse.
[2:10:55] LegitBanana_: @EsfandTV who doesnt like cornwood?

[2:23:46] pieruruka: try doing the samne thing to a local car to test
[2:23:48] JC9R_: shift 1 just has serious problems and louise is a product of it
[2:23:50] theblackdog808: there's a lot going on behind scenes on the server that people don't realize, I assume
[2:23:50] tehshoe: @slowcrow most regulars on this stream are fine, but alot of people hop around and are weird
[2:23:51] blombomm: just happened in last chase with suarez
[2:23:51] hoanzlgoas: Did any investigation Den did ever get looked at and continued like the whole car scrapper thing?
[2:23:54] eliteone11: all this esfandtv rp arc has taught me is that the hardcore gta rp watchers suck at understanding how the gameplay can sometimes fuck up the rp
[2:23:55] skeletonmike: taurus has +10 pit/ram power
[2:23:58] DanLGG: That was a bubble ram which isn’t entirely your fault. if siz who is an admin btw didn’t say anything about then OOC there wasn’t anything wrong with it.

[2:24:06] MillerThyme: literally assault with a deadly weapon crashing into them

[3:45:33] shesamaniac: @alexanderpethrus exactly which is why I'm not even malding
[3:45:35] w111iam1: yeah took him away
[3:45:39] tinywulf: "attempting to cuff" he announced it even
[3:45:44] LogicWeasel: started out shitty, became a full on shitshow.
[3:45:47] MoohamedAlii: Both get obstruction
[3:45:47] jacksmithcje: cornwood is right but there should be a lighter charge for tackling compared to hitting someone down imo
[3:45:50] Archangel3003: @sendemup It's still obstruction. Only cause of game mechanics did the cuffs still go off
[3:45:52] Recon_XoX: Who's the Blonde cop guy? Haven't seen him before

[3:46:12] Daarro: the Dick guy wasnt the one hit u
[3:46:21] Switchblade142: @aztec8669 Stacking = same charge for same incident (e.g giving him both misdemeanor and felony obstruction), not charging for each crime committed
[3:46:23] kurai_panties: just charge him for murder already
[3:46:25] Mangodecuba: put them all on electric chair
[3:46:26] julho94: any clips

[3:47:48] omascas: @shesamaniac I'm only disagreeing with you because when you question the RP you can create a sense of hostility that isn't there, and that tends to happen when the company, xqc, or chang gang do it. esfand then  has to spend 20 minutes explaining that it is in character. no judgement on you, honestly, but we get so many chatters from other streams coming and arguing RP that we need to not fall into it too

You just finished some Marxian historian, Pete Garrison prob'ly, and so naturally that's what you believe until next month when you get to James Lemon and get convinced that Virginia and Pennsylvania were strongly entrepreneurial and capitalist back in 1740. That'll last until sometime in your second year, then you'll be in here regurgitating Gordon Wood about the Pre-revolutionary utopia.

[4:56:51] rotarydawg: @lilisongss  learn how to type LOL
[4:56:51] ragincyclone: How's the wrist holding up this time? I remember last time it was giving you issues while driving
[4:56:51] thedonmegatv: Octo lost the cops in a suv with 4 people lol
[4:56:52] b2a80: Suarez and maybe Bones seem like the only ones that can stick on Crims now
[4:56:54] xseeeeeeee: moon2WALK hello
[4:56:55] kweemoo: It's not the vehicle. It is the same driver lost an interceptor in an suv with 4 people in it last time.
[4:56:56] deftcg: Training camp yesterday was great @EsfandTV
[4:56:58] Gr1zzz: Lol ur def better
[4:57:00] tischance: I wouldn’t call corn a driver, but you’re definitely improving
[4:57:01] Glaistig: Playing reactively (chasing) is a lot harder imo
[4:57:01] SarahFlare: you've had civ cars get absolutely battered and not smoke but about 4 cop cars are smoking
[4:57:01] Van_1912: @EsfandTV please take the turbos out. you helped in the short term but made things worse in the long term honestly. :/
[4:57:02] workwerk: with bones yeah
[4:57:02] Caleamabob: we did good COPEFAND
[4:57:03] Ieestring: "we did good" LULW
[4:57:04] jokerm21: people don’t complain about the regular cop cars. from what I’ve been hearing from other streamers is they are scared of the Taurus
[4:57:04] Thoughtbread23: yo this chat is wild. how is esfand getting so much hate rn? lmao
[4:57:05] skeletonmike: do you think a more realistic damage model on the cars would be better or worse for rp (less durable vehicles)
[4:57:06] Deiafter: Actual facts lately good driving, just can't pit Ruby lul
[4:57:08] donbena_: @Unbenchkenchh this is not ranked ro

[4:57:18] Caleamabob: letting criminal escape = good OMEGALAUGHING
[4:57:18] Kunotr0n: is that why Crims keep Karening about Bones and Lenny, because they are good drivers?

[4:57:40] b2a80: @jukla12 Yup, kylie for sure.  Haven't seen Lenny/Moon drive yet
[4:57:42] Fenix_TV: Taurus' should definitely at least be the default vehicle
[4:57:43] Caleamabob: @R3d_Gum gonna cry? MaxLOL
[4:57:44] permacool: is this a cop server with crims or a crim server with cops

[4:58:01] Unmisterious2: @permacool yes
[4:58:01] petterseff: Not talking about your car
[4:58:02] b2a80: acceleration is more important in the city
[4:58:03] taytoeGG: You sleep in a closet so you could put more money into turbos than some civ's have made lol
[4:58:03] itWyrm: Its an INterceptor in name, not in performance and ppl are conflating it LULW

[6:02:21] RDS_RELOADED: what I don’t understand is how an ordinary officer is the liaison and not a captain, only reason I can think of is they want to avoid putting too much responsibility

[9:04:14] MrBASins: but hey can say they did say something but you did hear them
[9:04:14] IllusiOGnarly: ...ARCHER PHRASING!
[9:04:18] RobialT: Carmella would have gotten a worse charge than Peanut

[9:04:27] minich4rmander: we dont know who was drivin. so everyone was reckless evading Pepega
[9:04:28] Leafyerick: @EsfandTV Actually it would be amazing for an RP character flaw if Duncan let women get away with shit if they flirt with him LMAO
[9:04:28] slomojosh: Duncaning it definitely wasn’t Carmella she had no idea
[9:04:29] FelipeLLs: VeryEs
[9:04:31] HealzPleaze: @jollypnda yeah they dont get that some cops never have been crims should be a requirement tbh she also plays a hard @ss so its hard to tell if its her in character or shes just stuck on somthing
[9:04:31] FelipeLLs: VeryEs
[9:04:32] bageldr: PogBones
[9:04:33] ComradeGreetingCard: wait did they not do peanut's warrant?
[9:04:34] mortuusintus12: based on carmella's statement, she slept before everyone rode. so it couldve been a 2 way street that the people didnt know she was there either until she woke up. so Ruby making those assumptions doesnt provide the right logic right ?
[9:04:35] cocopamda: @SharkzGG_ yea but that's borderline voice ID some people could have same faces
[9:04:37] cuspeli: sniffthenewchatter
[9:04:37] rubberbreaker: So if mr.k never admitted it to being him and no id was shown and no search was done can they identify him for a warrant?
[9:04:39] FelipeLLs: BOGGED
[9:04:40] Toastbane: Letting Carmella go because she was in the trunk is reasonable, she could contest it easily
[9:04:41] FelipeLLs: BOGGED yes ?

[9:05:08] gajitron: o
[9:05:10] SharkzGG_: @cocopamda its not even close to borderline voice ID, visual ID is just how things work in the server along with DNA and fingerprints

[9:05:18] SirGO0SE: @Toastbane you don't think that's a bad precedent? just always keep an accomplice in the trunk then
[9:05:18] cocopamda: @Raja_Banhammer fingerprint them while unmasking like they do in 3.0??

[9:11:35] mortuusintus12: @Kevz95 its not a felony if they cant articulate it. as duncan is saying, the arrest they have rn isnt related to a robbery, and possesion is supported by carmella's statement. they are in no way "ASSUME" for a probable cause.
