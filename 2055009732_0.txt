[0:14:10] StreetBull: little forza action monkaSTEER
[0:14:36] miasarres: Not me pretending to know the difference btw soft or hard tires
[0:15:03] noxen_n: soft=+grip -durability
[0:15:10] noxen_n: the opposite for hards
[0:15:41] miasarres: @noxen_n ohh ok its better for the turns then ?
[0:15:53] noxen_n: basically
[0:16:04] miasarres: okk thankss
[0:17:01] StreetBull: @miasarres simple, softer compound = better grip and higher degradation, if you increased how hard the compound is you will get more laps from those tires but will lose time because you can't push as hard since you have less grip
[0:17:20] PrismaPalma: neutrenHey
[0:18:42] miasarres: @streetbull oh okk understandable

[1:43:03] 1804acee: rumor that Andrew who Lin might leave too
[1:43:05] StreetBull: Ferrari as put a lot of money in Lewis and his projects, also accepting anyone who wants to follow him.. so Bono might go with him too
