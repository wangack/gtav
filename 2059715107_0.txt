[1:50:46] stianvn: Oh patty on smoke
[1:50:46] magic_freak: I mean, the vallet positions are all legal parking spots, right?
[1:50:47] TheMaloneMan: half the time tow push the car out so they can tow it
[1:50:47] SkyLineRaider: "Can we get it out?". What? A legally parked car?
[1:50:51] Cephyric: They're towing cars in the customer parking lot of a restaurant, they have 0 room to complain OMEGADANCEBUTFAST

[1:51:58] ExoticPotatoe: nerdy some places yes
[1:51:58] Cephyric: Luscion All the parking spots in that car park are legal parking spots that they have no right to tow
[1:51:59] pewthy: There's literally a car on their truck
[1:52:21] rathan_reddy: it gets frustating but it is what it is YesYes
[1:52:26] SteinCr: The one on their truck was diagonal on 2 spots

[1:52:27] Luscion: that one on the back wasnt in one @Cephyric
[1:52:30] C_Bold: They're supposed to take pictures of it parked illegally. Obviously they try to bend the rules whenever they can... like a true tow driver?
[1:52:35] ExoticPotatoe: newbie wolfaHey
[1:52:39] whens__lunch: you have to have a special license to tow right
[1:52:39] bajajchetak: are you a law abiding citizen or do you fuck shit up in rp

[1:53:06] Kroykumzz: yesh
[1:53:15] PartTimeNinja_: @doogar doesnt have to be every tow to leave a bad taste
[1:53:15] Cephyric: Turning up immediately to active cop scenes to start towing cop and chased cars is insane
[1:53:17] PattyIce3: no @c_bold a true tow truck driver doesn’t ram parked cars with their tow truck. so not like a real tow truck driver at all
[1:53:17] BorophylI: RAGEY I need to be mad at someone
[1:53:18] pewthy: Too far NOWAY
[1:53:32] magic_freak: @doogar of course not but Valletta positions are legal to park in normally so it shouldn't matter if they called them
[1:53:35] a_killner999: dojaW
[1:53:39] 4gharta: it's a slippery slope, like when people used to skip medical rp
[1:53:40] doogar: @PartTimeNinja_ its RP, catch them in the act and get the licence removed?
