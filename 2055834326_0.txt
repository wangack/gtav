[1:14:19] xGotNoClout: Fix it with nukes EZ
[1:14:20] VacB_: basically mate its to abolish all Christian and traditional religions inorder to replace them with a one-world religion based on the cult of man
[1:14:21] Athasin: @Zzaannmmaann1234 If their technology is more advanced than human technology, and they have the higher thinking to utilize that technology to leave their planet, leave their solar system, come to our solar system, and our planet. They're smarter.
[1:14:24] Smoogol: no we can't

[8:24:51] combattingjosh: Kappa
[8:24:54] AptLoki23: @combattingjosh UK police can ram you off a moped even without a moped, new law. The law came into place because people were taking their helmets off mid chase. Don’t matter anymore, won’t cease the pursuit anymore.
[8:24:57] BlindFlapjack: Sure
[8:25:00] IraqiWizard: @Caeros He is at the ripe age of 35 years KEKW

[8:25:58] Zunnun: @ShazerGaming Don't think he is wearing/using a mask either
[8:26:02] Caeros: @ShazerGaming he could have chosen to RP his way out since denzel didn't have anything on him, instead he ran
[8:26:03] OhkE: i thought the chase was a blast to watch
[8:26:22] OhkE: @Caeros we all know that wouldnt be the case
