[2:53:16] Riqui__: Nurnberg trials disagree
[2:53:18] BooksBlanketsandTea: Yeaaah all Slacks is doing is making sure that cops in lower ranks will hesitate before following orders. Which, fair enough if it's blatantly against the law - but during a scene? that's on the order giver NODDERS

[3:07:16] VSDuck: @DonnieDarkoTheD I mean you are right it's not much different, it's more just about the reach the two have right? A General has a ton more authority over a typical soldier so really the order given to a typical soldier would be useless in a big stage setting
[3:08:16] BooksBlanketsandTea: and it's SO important that this distinction is hashed out Now, in this room, rather than in an instance of a situation gone wrong

[5:08:26] bobdang07hd: that’s a dap
[5:08:37] BooksBlanketsandTea: AAAA
[5:09:20] Usahi_Light: max pressing for treason then expunging it would be hilarious
[5:10:00] bobdang07hd: the way people feel? That’s so many daps
[5:10:26] blockfis: everybody?
[5:11:05] bobdang07hd: that’s daps ok everyone for saying how they feel
[5:11:12] BakinPacman: Beric KEKW

[5:12:44] blockfis: HYPERNODDERS
[5:12:57] RadahTatTat: i can't handle how much they talk about ruth kivaDed
[5:13:01] FLORIDaPKER: SeemsGood
[5:13:09] BooksBlanketsandTea: peepoShy can we have Beric and McNulty patrol together one day soon? think it'll be chill vibes
[5:13:09] random_viewer_55: 10-80 Pog
[5:13:10] corporate_1: corporate_1 subscribed with Prime. 
[5:13:12] RadahTatTat: also there's such a strong case of martyr syndrome happening with some cops AAAA holyyyy
[5:13:14] bobdang07hd: well said Ruth lives in people’s head rent free
[5:13:14] Crosstak: Are you sure it is OOC? I don't see that side of things being a viewer
[5:13:19] Daniie: i think it stems from she just happened to be the captain/officer present early one on a lot of "contested" situations and then peope piled on
[5:13:26] RadahTatTat: @Crosstak very much so
[5:13:29] BooksBlanketsandTea: yeaaaah it's pretty meh, honestly.
[5:13:32] ChilledGuild: @Crosstak then ur blind cuase its everywhere
[5:13:42] RadahTatTat: is fucking gross tbh
[5:13:53] BooksBlanketsandTea: YEP
[5:14:04] RadahTatTat: we can barely hear you over lenny btw
[5:14:11] APHSnake: I think Ruth is an amazing cop
[5:14:12] Crosstak: @ChilledGuild Or I don't watch rp for 16 hours of the day....
[5:14:19] Crosstak: I get what you mean @Lt_Custard
[5:14:37] zzzzzzz8133: I get it cause you hear it 24/7 its anything and everything people are talking about
[5:14:42] ejcxx: Didn't cornwood take Ruth to that wedding last night so I thought that were good?
[5:14:49] bobdang07hd: by far the best part of mcnulty is when you said I don’t have time for this or people wasting my time and going back on dusty
[5:15:03] JediJacob_: iirc ruth wrote/helped write all the SOPS
[5:15:04] hawkeye69r: @ejcxx that was ruby lol
[5:15:15] RadahTatTat: @ejcxx that was ruby not ruth
[5:15:21] ejcxx: @hawkeye69r there were so many people hahaha thank you
[5:15:37] BooksBlanketsandTea: what's that? a stern, serious woman in a position of power is facing backlash for exercising that power? Suuuurely not CollinSuffer
[5:15:44] hawkeye69r: people actually hate cheever because of ruth
[5:15:46] ejcxx: Tbf i'm new to this so i haven't even really seen ruth thats where my confusion was
[5:15:50] Najb0lji: Esfand has said the same
[5:15:52] blockfis: The PD scapegoat classic
[5:15:57] RadahTatTat: @BooksBlanketsandTea exactly kivaDed
[5:16:04] random_viewer_55: from the crim side they hate her for different reasons. (the Mr. K warrant)
[5:16:05] Powercope: 10000% agree
[5:16:34] Roughnalph: I haven't seen someone drive this bike. How fast does it go?
[5:16:42] DonnieDarkoTheD: The pendulum swings plus people are unreasonable typically imo whereas a person can usually be reasoned with
[5:16:47] RadahTatTat: it was literally on comment HIGHLIGHTING how ridiculous max's statements were KEKW insane
[5:16:53] APHSnake: If people hate the player more then the character then they are just hopping crybabies who take the RP too seriously
[5:16:54] random_viewer_55: not even Max IC thinks its treason he's just acting bad faith IC
[5:17:08] bobdang07hd: to be fair don’t say “can we vote for overthrow the council”….
[5:17:24] BooksBlanketsandTea: also... how the hell can you commit treason in a nation with free speech, without something like.. selling state secrets to other nations, or something?? Like.. what?
[5:17:45] ejcxx: I thought treason was only for the king and shit WutFace
[5:17:46] hawkeye69r: @bobdang07hd to be fair, its a logical argument
[5:17:49] RadahTatTat: @random_viewer_55 bh CG is hyperfixated on her as well and a lot comes from the cop drama (not the K situation)
[5:17:54] RadahTatTat: *tbh
[5:17:56] BooksBlanketsandTea: @bobdang07hd I mean. That's exactly how democracy works? If the people don't like how a political party is working.. they get voted out.
[5:17:59] random_viewer_55: even Crane said right away its not treason
[5:18:18] RadahTatTat: ^^^ exactly
[5:18:19] DonnieDarkoTheD: It's the optics not really the actions and I believe that it will swing the otherway later
[5:18:28] hawkeye69r: i think peoples hatred for ruth is misplaced appreciation of the character
[5:18:59] Moose_Potato: Howdy
[5:19:01] SecretChiley: @random_viewer_55 Well, the talk captains had after in the hallway was definitely treasonous. Only issue is, only way they can figure that out in character is if one of the captains mention it
[5:19:02] bobdang07hd: @hawkeye69r argument? it was a comment that she said and was a “joke” when her character has never had a sense of humour ever
[5:19:07] Moose_Potato: Damn when'd PD get bikes
[5:19:33] hawkeye69r: @bobdang07hd it wasnt a joke. but it was an argument.
[5:19:39] VSDuck: @Moose_Potato a week and a bit ago
[5:19:40] DonnieDarkoTheD: @hawkeye69r I think as a character she is unlikable for some because everyone has met someone like her so basically a great character
[5:19:40] Daniie: gonna beat his 1-95 eh?
[5:19:46] APHSnake: Cheever is a fantastic roleplayer and they don't deserve the hate for them playing their character so well
[5:19:48] BooksBlanketsandTea: @SecretChiley again: treason in a nation with free speech? It's not like they were selling state secrets to another nation. The mayor is an elected official, not a dictator.
[5:20:14] RadahTatTat: @bobdang07hd nice narrative KEKW it was literally on comment HIGHLIGHTING how ridiculous max's statements were. and max agreed with crane that it was NOT tresonous
[5:20:15] bobdang07hd: @hawkeye69r negative it’s an argument not because she was out of line and said it but apparently it’s a “joke”
[5:20:34] BooksBlanketsandTea: ⭐ hypeE GOLD STARS FOR EVERYONE ⭐
[5:20:37] VSDuck: PAUSERS
[5:20:42] NamesOmega: I know its a joke but the hype is even getting me hyped
[5:20:52] StormehSeas: Dab doesnt actually think its treason, he's trying to use this as leverage
[5:20:54] JediJacob_: power play. mcnulty gets commissioner and makes Ruth his assistant commissioner AAAA
[5:20:58] BooksBlanketsandTea: @NamesOmega NODDERS the hype is unironically good for morale
[5:21:01] random_viewer_55: @SecretChiley conversations in private are should not be held at the same standard. If we go by that logic the convo before with McNulty and Cornwood about Ruth you could say that Cornwood made threats on the life of Ruth
[5:21:04] wolfhall113: Freedom of speech only takes you so far until you break a law or impose on someone elses rights
[5:21:12] BooksBlanketsandTea: YEP
[5:21:19] bobdang07hd: @radahtattat cute take on it
[5:21:30] hawkeye69r: @bobdang07hd her comment boils down to. "if it is the case that one branch of government can vote to take power from another, then can we vote to take power from you? obviously not, therefore by parallel logic, you cant take power of us"
[5:21:41] random_viewer_55: KEKW
[5:21:44] RadahTatTat: @bobdang07hd i know NODDERS it's what happens when you pay attention
[5:21:48] random_viewer_55: PepeLaugh
[5:21:54] K1lpkonn: idk if you know but she actually said some shit after it, if that went under oath it'd be pretty bad PepeLaugh
[5:21:56] BooksBlanketsandTea: @wolfhall113 neither of which happened here. Saying "I disagree with this political decision and will vote against it in future" and Being Able To Do So is basically the backbone of a working democracy.
[5:22:03] TheZoulStormer: moon2Y Max is a pussy
[5:22:07] VSDuck: You can't get in the way or push back on Max it won't end well
[5:22:09] bobdang07hd: @hawkeye69r pd isnt a branch of the government
[5:22:12] Najb0lji: he was a terrorist after all
[5:22:16] TheZoulStormer: OMEGALUL he is
[5:22:17] Smiddler: it was miscommunication as well as getting heated and saying the wrong thing at the worst time

[5:22:27] NamesOmega: so true
[5:22:28] Daniie: max had zero actual interest in PD affairs until it got really bad - his mayorship was gonna focus on other stuff and this just took center stage
[5:22:30] Subspacez: moon2M true
[5:22:33] BooksBlanketsandTea: AAAA
[5:22:33] Nightbot: AAAA
[5:22:38] GordoComeDoritos: moon2M true and real
[5:22:41] hawkeye69r: @bobdang07hd doesnt matter. youre giving me evidence against her argument, NOT evidence that she wasnt trying to make an argument
[5:22:45] Riggoon: moon2SPY moon subs are cringe
[5:22:52] DonnieDarkoTheD: Insurection and or treason are inherently vague . It's the optics of the situation that allows moon attempt to push something even if it doesn't fit.
[5:22:56] wolfhall113: @BooksBlanketsandTea I don't think ruth is gonna get in trouble for this, but max managed to 1. smear her name by talking loudly about this and 2. get her temporarily suspended so it's probably still a good move for max
[5:23:29] hawkeye69r: @wolfhall113 i dont even care if ruth does get in trouble. its all juiicy RP. i just fucking despise people hating the streamer
[5:23:33] bobdang07hd: @hawkeye69r what argument? are you okay?
[5:23:34] K1lpkonn: @wolfhall113 She could get in trouble for something she said after though
[5:23:36] PacU1405: The PD problems were brought to him by Crane and Malton gave his opinions
[5:23:43] VSDuck: @hawkeye69r THis
[5:23:43] iAmDuckie: verbal crimes are still crimes, are they not?
[5:23:47] wolfhall113: @hawkeye69r Yeah the RP is great regardless
[5:23:49] BooksBlanketsandTea: @wolfhall113 Oh for sure, in terms of the RP it's fantastic and it's a very good smear campaign by Max. But it's insane that some people Actually think what she said was genuinely treason KEKW
[5:24:00] Usahi_Light: i think ruth should've done a bit of a slower burn but its such good RP still
[5:24:00] APHSnake: @hawkeye69r THIS
[5:24:18] DonnieDarkoTheD: Bias works in funny ways
[5:24:42] VSDuck: As long as the OOC streamers are okay with what is happening IC idgaf the RP is great
[5:24:48] Roughnalph: If someone is gonna be power hungry like Max, I'm just glad he's actually smart.
[5:24:50] K1lpkonn: WICKED
[5:24:57] hawkeye69r: @bobdang07hd are you lost son? i said her statement wasnt a treasonous threat, it was an argument. then you said 'well her argument is wrong'. thats conceding the point to me
[5:25:41] bobdang07hd: @hawkeye69r you’re lost dude, you said argument twice now. take care and touch grass
[5:25:51] Friedthelt: bazzWaiting
[5:25:59] RadahTatTat: CAN HE SAY THAT??? D:
[5:26:12] SchumiU: OMEGALUL
[5:26:19] Nightbot: Come join the discord and fill up the ranks! https://discord.gg/PMrxK3F
[5:26:23] VSDuck: @hawkeye69r and @bobdang07hd chill peeps just enjoy the show ltcustLove
[5:26:24] Estidal: Praying this bit eventually ends up in court for the bit
[5:26:24] random_viewer_55: who put those trees there seriously?
[5:26:40] BigMac8835: @hawkeye69r clearly a Ruth fan. she literally stated a treason threat to the mayor doesn’t have a clue how to do her job and is ruining a lot of people’s rp due to negligence
[5:27:08] junk_dog96: Thats a dap
[5:27:10] VSDuck: @BigMac8835 custyCringe
[5:27:13] hawkeye69r: @BigMac8835 so what, you just ruin ruths RP?
[5:27:18] BooksBlanketsandTea: @BigMac8835 FirstTimeChatter

[5:27:44] BigMac8835: @hawkeye69r ruin hers to save many others
[5:27:47] RadahTatTat: @BigMac8835 bro... KEKW step away from the keyboard
[5:27:49] bobdang07hd: @hawkeye69r do us all a favour and go outside and get some air
[5:28:12] BigMac8835: @radahtattat just an opinion mate
[5:28:30] JediJacob_: this is meta: friccbutluvv
[5:28:37] RadahTatTat: @BigMac8835 it's delulu Gladge
[5:28:52] hawkeye69r: @BigMac8835 just let the ppl play their characters and let the chips fall where they may. easy :)
[5:28:55] BooksBlanketsandTea: @BigMac8835 having an opinion on a politician or political party is only treason if you live in a dictatorship. In a democracy you can have the opinion "this policy is bad and I will vote against it" - that's not treason.
[5:28:58] Usahi_Light: i think a lot of it isnt 100% intentioinal too, perspective is like a huge thing
[5:29:00] RadahTatTat: NODDERS

[5:31:48] random_viewer_55: but that's just 1 perspective
[5:31:48] JediJacob_: so how about that sports team
[5:31:51] iAmDuckie: moon2PAIN
[5:32:01] wolfhall113: @random_viewer_55 That's just RP dawg, everyone has IC reasons for what they do
[5:32:06] Rayvohs: is the rebel in stock yet?
[5:32:22] VSDuck: @bobdang07hd I have no authority here just lookin out for a fellow viewer ltcustLove
[5:32:26] Grommpyy: What! How dare you have nuanced and adult takes in RP
[5:32:50] VSDuck: the fuck you hit

[5:33:16] APHSnake: So how about Eugene, don't we just think he is behind everything?
[5:33:19] TheZoulStormer: PepegaGun He's reaching
[5:33:40] DonnieDarkoTheD: Shes getting demonized now because its helping some IC agendas (not saying some are valid/invalid)
[5:33:42] BooksBlanketsandTea: D: oh my god he's right
[5:33:45] JasonVoorhees71: pepeSmoke

[5:33:50] Smiddler: yung dab was ruth the whole time
[5:33:58] Friedthelt: how could Eugene make Kian park his bike there
[5:33:58] APHSnake: Eugene is just McNulty's Dinkleburg
[5:33:59] Smiddler: its an inside job
[5:34:11] RadahTatTat: @DonnieDarkoTheD NODDERS
[5:34:42] random_viewer_55: 140mph in front of Rhodes D:

[5:35:09] danmac: especially when cornwood is in his "undercover" outfit
[5:35:11] BooksBlanketsandTea: totally off topic but wouldn't it be funny if McNulty gets accidentally run over while on a PD bike and it throws McNulty into a spiral where he ends up leaving PD and joining an MC- oh wait, I've seen that arc PeepoGiggles

[5:36:17] Crosstak: I only hop for reactions
[5:36:19] Smiddler: parasocial hoppers are dumb af
[5:36:19] wolfhall113: People always forget that characters are working with limited information
[5:36:26] Moose_Potato: Imagine if Collin Returns as a Cop Main OOOO
[5:36:29] iAmDuckie: the misconstruing is also WILD
[5:36:54] VSDuck: So you aren't Kian McNulty?

[5:39:16] thejain: yeah
[5:39:49] RadahTatTat: custy has a crush on siz IRL peepoShy
[5:39:58] Usahi_Light: divajilly talked about that a bit, there's some stuff you cant remove from a character 100% because theyre so ingrained with yourself ooc
[5:40:05] theroostersrest: appreciate you custy ltcustLove
[5:40:08] 0zarruu: good mentality
[5:40:25] iAmDuckie: SeemsGood
[5:40:28] TheZoulStormer: People put a lot of themselves in their characters, it's unavoidable. You just have to be self aware about it NODDERS
[5:40:42] bobdang07hd: all I heard was a cooking stream
[5:40:48] thejain: nice
[5:41:04] iAmDuckie: this is why I only do emojis moon2PAIN
[5:41:08] hawkeye69r: its rational right? if you are trying to solve a crime using your OOC reasoning and someone insults your characters IC reasoning. it is just insulting OOC
[5:41:27] thejain: lmao
[5:41:29] TheZoulStormer: PepeLaugh
[5:41:34] iAmDuckie: LUL

[5:42:14] TheZoulStormer: moon2L You're not being very poggers right now, let him go
[5:42:34] VSDuck: @DieterK Crim to Police if that makes sense
[5:42:49] iAmDuckie: MAN this is why i want to articulate the ruth thing with all the opposing things against maxs reason behind it but its so back looking
[5:42:58] iAmDuckie: bAD*
[5:42:58] thejain: True! i think arrests or a good chase make for great content! it gets frustrated when some cops dont interact at all and just arrest! etc.... but not all cops! i feel like its harder to RP as cop! from a viewer POV
[5:43:18] hachoopoo: W chasers vs those who actually want good content
[5:43:37] RadahTatTat: oooo can you raid Jonthebroski ?? peepoShy ltcustLove
[5:43:50] DieterK: The thousands of car swaps during chases along with the cuffs and tazer scuffs is very annoying
