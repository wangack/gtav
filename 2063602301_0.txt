[3:18:33] xdannyx98: ye
[3:18:44] miasarres: is it LA time ?
[3:18:57] CYDERVERSE: @miasarres Yes, those three are all on LA time (NA West)
[3:19:28] bramador808: neutrenSip
[3:19:43] miasarres: @cyderverse tyy
[3:20:58] bruHoran: Susge
[3:21:52] Shad0w_wizard: so 130pm pst is 430pm est? as an east coaster that would work for me if I was in this situation or a similar situation but I can't speak for Gigi since she's East Coast
[3:22:12] CYDERVERSE: @Shad0w_wizard Yes, 1:30pm PST is 4:30pm EST
[3:22:47] Shad0w_wizard: yea personally I wouldnt have a problem with that IF this was me in this situation
[3:22:52] IlRaptorlI: @shad0w_wizard she is normally live by 2, today is an exception because she was live for 12 hours yesterday, but she has said on discord that she is planning on streaming soon.
[3:23:06] Shad0w_wizard: @IlRaptorlI yea I seen that
[3:23:07] bruHoran: Timezones awaree
[3:24:03] IlRaptorlI: but having a set time for the robbery would help out the group a ton with cash intake and USBs.
[3:24:10] Nisl: Octo x Marty neutrenThumb
[3:24:27] morulanvr: Funny thing is they never try to talk to marty directly
[3:24:52] madbandit23: Yuno has marty
[3:24:53] bruHoran: @morulanvr I feel like the Marty talk will happen sooner than later
[3:24:59] madbandit23: Yuno has money*
[3:25:23] Nisl: @morulanvr Yeah and Marty even approved it with them first and hasn't changed anything in the agreement.
[3:25:34] EyeScraem: Still need a 4 door too on top of this
[3:25:37] IlRaptorlI: @morulanvr I think that’s mainly because right now he is traveling and he is normally up when everyone else is asleep, GIGI talked a tiny bit to him yesterday but she was already up 12 hours and wanted to sleep.
[3:25:45] Blavod: ^^
[3:26:13] morulanvr: CB comms but it will be resolved for sure, it takes time
[3:26:39] bidaboo: guys they are not changing marty's crew. they are making their set crew. the talk to marty would be probably about why they are dissolving the second crew
[3:26:43] IlRaptorlI: yup, for sure will get resolved, especially when Marty gets back home and isn’t traveling.
[3:27:40] morulanvr: Yuno, octo, marty, tony, lang, gigi would be insane
[3:27:58] Blavod: need a solid lockpick supplier for this also
[3:28:05] Nisl: Octo x Marty x Yuno x X dream ruined neutrenCry
[3:28:19] Blavod: or fake plates PepeLa
[3:28:28] bruHoran: @Nisl that was never gonna happen tbh
[3:28:32] FlackAttack94: Marty will be a 6th sometimes no doubt
[3:28:40] FlackAttack94: X tho
[3:28:48] FlackAttack94: No clue
[3:28:52] Nisl: @bruHoran never say never, if you watch other streams neutrenNometa
[3:28:56] IlRaptorlI: @bidaboo they have been having issues with Marty talking to Yuno and Gigi instead of Lang, which is understandable with how the times they are awake are, but once Marty gets back he can explain everything and make it clear as to what he is thinking.
[3:29:52] Firepokachu: that restock is needed
[3:29:57] chapternine1279: How much per person tho?
[3:29:57] Nisl: @bruHoran I'll DM you so no influence here

[3:31:12] IlRaptorlI: @dizzledaz true true, they all have their flaws that need to be addressed, but they do have the benefit of being able to actually group up and talk to eachother about the issues.
