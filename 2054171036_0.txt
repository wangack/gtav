[0:03:06] Fossabot:  whipStinky Please do not tell streamer what to do or how to do it unless specifically asked by streamer, even if he forgets or doesn't see something. Back-seating acts as an unwanted external influence to the roleplay.

[0:36:10] AshleyJordan235: its got birthing hips lmao
[0:36:12] MrOsey_: biggest club in the city
[0:36:16] mccaw98: The induvidual is separate from the gang, if you get up good.. you have more time to focus on the club, wich gives you more time to create the strongest gang in the city
[0:36:19] Kota216: won’t it take forever (years) for a RP server to come out even after 6 is released?

[0:37:20] Kota216: right that’s my point
[0:37:28] nesDk: bought stonks in ttwo, they made 18% so far and next game is paid for by them. thank you RP community
[0:37:44] AshleyJordan235: @Whippy do you think with Rockstar working with FiveM they might be developing the new RP stuff with GTA 6?
[0:37:53] shacklyn: it's going to be fun watching you learn the map in GTA6.

[2:43:00] NoranorTV: Jr was in that to then!
[2:43:01] Swindles87: i love chip but chip was fairly new to the club and just was a baby crim at this moment
[2:43:03] SlashThePriest: Def gonna have to be a hangie for a while then
[2:43:04] Krisgadgets: nope all need testing
[2:43:04] skiti22: chip was fighting for u tho no?
[2:43:05] amras1987: chip always tried to keep a level head and think club first though
[2:43:06] iamloyaltytv: was it his decision to over throw ou?
[2:43:06] dono_saur: I like chippy
[2:43:07] pepe_silvia_as: he still stuck by you though
[2:43:07] geckoZen: forget about the past, what about today. Was he part of the ADMC that betrayed you
[2:43:08] glitteringsnowfox: I think he wouldn’t want Dee as the authoritative figure that he wants
[2:43:08] SlushieStar: Depends if dee understand why he was betrayed Hmmge
[2:43:09] TronWeasley: He was one of the last supporters though too
[2:43:09] BiigDaave: He was on the side that wanted you back
[2:43:10] bitter_harambe: If Dundee wants people to leave 3.0 behind, he needs to leave 3.0 behind for other people too
[2:43:10] FriendlyAF88: yes cus chip, was not part of main people who wanted dee out
[2:43:12] shacklyn: yes, i would.  chip was dogged by that group after dee left.
[2:43:14] nummento: chip did screw you in 4.0 too
[2:43:14] rcmartinez2441: idk I feel like Dundee acts on impulse and gut feeling, am I wrong? @Whippy
[2:43:16] Booman2791: I mean chip has gone out of his way to help you now
[2:43:22] DOWNBAD_ELLY: I would give him a shot at current BBMC and see if he likes it
[2:43:25] Oscar_Herodo: Dundee needs someone like chip i think
[2:43:28] Swindles87: yup chip is a flipper and flopper
[2:43:28] amras1987: You got mad about people remembering 5 years ago. now its your turn @Whippy
[2:43:29] kimosabii1: Ellie, Jr and Chip where all part of that club and youve asking the other 2
[2:43:39] joker990909j: its spicy but if you think about it he as there but never made the decision it was barry and colin who pulled the trigger
[2:43:44] ReinBork: Chip was one of the few BBMC that still hung out with Dee and helped him. Didn't he give Dee a car to flip?
[2:43:46] yourfriendlybuss: yes, I think chip was Loyal to the club not to a person.
[2:43:47] r_troglodyte: Hell, he's currently flip flopping
[2:43:47] pepe_silvia_as: ya
[2:43:47] BiigDaave: Chip was not part of the coup
[2:43:50] FriendlyAF88: hangie would good change to prove were he lies
[2:43:51] DDDDAAAAANNNN: YES W B
[2:43:54] The_Baker_Cam: @amras1987 Ayy Yoo True!
[2:43:57] TheeBudz: The question is was he involved or was he just following orders?
[2:43:58] Krisgadgets: take JNR over them all
[2:44:00] Kinson1: @Whippy You betrayed the BBMC by trying to kill members (Norman stuff). Is it really BBMC's fault or is it your fault?
[2:44:01] SlashThePriest: Can't all have yes men tho. Is he flipfloping or just voicing his concerns
[2:44:07] AndreasMartin1: We might have to see where the conversation takes us. Even if we want him DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance
[2:44:12] nummento: oh yeah that is true.
[2:44:20] jukey208122: New beginnings and all that but for Dundee as a character he would be sceptical
[2:44:22] TronWeasley: I think Chippy lala has the bored chaos vibe too
[2:44:29] Swindles87: lets see how the RP plays out :D
[2:44:29] pepe_silvia_as: and chip is always around
[2:44:30] FriendlyAF88: dee did hurt bbmc try to kill member norman stuff
[2:44:31] DOWNBAD_ELLY: YEEEE Chip said he loved Dee and apologized/talked about how grateful he was at the end of 3.0 iirc
[2:44:42] WOOD_vt: chip may not have always been happy with dee but hes always been loyal
[2:44:46] BiigDaave: Chip, Junior, Antonio. They were Dundees real homies
[2:44:56] skutza: KEKW
[2:45:00] jukey208122: Would love Junya
[2:45:02] DieMrCupCake: KEKW
[2:45:04] Krisgadgets: chips kool but Collin  in his ear all time didnt help
[2:45:12] tomr33: I feel like chip was always on dees side but had to save face and back the club... and that's why he distanced himself from the club
[2:45:15] DDDDAAAAANNNN: a pitch wouldnt hurt imo
[2:45:21] glitteringsnowfox: would chip agree with no HC? idk if he’d like the way Dee wants to run the club
[2:45:33] pepe_silvia_as: AAAA
[2:45:34] standymoments: until he becomes mr drifter
[2:45:53] pepe_silvia_as: chip literally dropped his high command role AAAA
[2:45:56] Swindles87: dee's way or the high way
[2:45:58] goblyn_king: HC sounds messy
[2:46:02] nummento: it was a drama fest
[2:46:04] TheMoS22: Bang Boys style leadership
[2:46:05] DieMrCupCake: Chip hated being in HC
[2:46:06] glitteringsnowfox: I don’t like HC either
[2:46:10] finnish00: Are tommy and Kelly founders
[2:46:12] OpyPhupapy: 4.0 is huge opportunity to try new people as hangarounds, giving change for new RP. Max don't work.
[2:46:16] TheeBudz: You just gotta lay out your cards and hope he want's to move forward with it NODDERS
[2:46:21] nummento: dee's way or the highway
[2:46:23] Oscar_Herodo: Chip would be great for connections
[2:46:24] pepe_silvia_as: chip just said nah im good, to high command
[2:46:31] geckoZen: high command also got pissy if they didn't get respected
[2:46:32] SlashThePriest: High command def not needed in such a small gamg
[2:46:35] Ushety: Dees way or  the high way whipGIGACHAD whipGIGACHAD whipGIGACHAD
[2:46:46] Kinson1: Can we have Officer Johnson as a BBMC hangaround again? KEKW
[2:46:46] TheeBudz: NODDERS
[2:46:52] FriendlyAF88: question who gonna make calls when dee is asleep though
[2:46:52] Oscar_Herodo: I wanna buy it
[2:46:59] geckoZen: pyramid scheme
[2:47:02] TheeBudz: So you were a politician AAAA
[2:47:18] Swindles87: plus HC gives other ppl the power to fuck dee over again and take his club..... i want BBMC to be dee's and for every1 to know what they are getting into before they join
[2:47:24] amras1987: does dundee even know what the club is? @Whippy
[2:47:30] glitteringsnowfox: NODDERS
[2:47:32] skutza: @FriendlyAF88 patched people - he's given kelly reigns on things etc
[2:47:34] yolfiic: @Swindles87 type shiiiiiiit
[2:47:34] Fellowpine6: I think a 2nd VP below the VP would be nice, more likely that at least two leaders/VIPs are awake
[2:47:36] Lunar_Delta: AAAA
[2:47:39] Valroz: if there is no HC what happens when there is a problem and dundee is asleep
[2:47:39] coliinn: wtf is this drip KEKW
[2:47:54] yolfiic: @Fellowpine6 that could be sgt at arms or enforcer
