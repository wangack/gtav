[2:41:35] SupportYourLocalLurker: only sure way to know it’s hardware is if she reinstalls windows and it’s still a problem rn.
[2:41:37] wusselwitro: do troubleshoot, start by installing gpu-z and cpu-z and check loads and temps during load, if all is ok, those things are sorted, then check RAM if ok scan HDs
[2:41:38] Agnophobia: reinstall winamp
[2:41:41] nitro2h: Hi Acie
[2:41:43] y0whateverdude: GIGACHAD  She reinstalled the entire game and was entertaining while that was going on GIGACHAD

[2:41:48] 0_Cl0UDZ: @Deathofcliffy sooo fun lmao
[2:41:56] megasoy: fresh windows install fixes the problem most of the time, and it'll rule out software issues

[3:36:52] wannaplaytwister: is it bad without stream though
[3:36:52] itzMarcellus: Maybe if she copied your game settings?
[3:36:57] Kevie70: YEp
[3:36:57] mavericks312: it’s gotta be her OBS cause she said it was fine offline
[3:36:59] CRlCK: it's not settings
[3:36:59] Roozy: its most likely a wierd graphic setting she has
[3:37:08] MaxaMinor: she had issues on rust too so not just gta
[3:37:10] ArcticViper009: You said you were hit too, maybe just hitting her harder
[3:37:11] ActualllyKevin: key

[3:37:32] Acheron13: Everyone lags in south side, but hers is worse
[3:37:34] cutz28: someone jelly of new talent
[3:37:36] IClaytec: i think it a combination from both
[3:37:36] genn1_: I wonder if she tried uninstalling Palworld, just as an experiment cause it happened the day after
[3:37:45] mryoussen: @bigdawg19 they can use jason and clay's G6 trucks they have a lot of storage

[3:37:54] 42arc: @genn1_ she did
[3:37:56] DeeZhuL: @midzito she did and she said it felt better with the stream off
[3:37:57] tictac82: It's not server related, she needs to use hwinfo and have someone who understand basic pc troubleshooting monitor while stresstesting to find the culprit.
[3:38:02] courage_ag: @cutz28 calm down LUL she's been doing the same thing for years
[3:38:05] wusselwitro: @victornor CPU-z and GPU-z during load is def the place to start

[3:38:20] mighty0mighty: @genn1_ it won’t be palworld
[3:38:34] AkumaXXii: it’s most likely the load on her cpu or gpu
[3:38:35] peDak1: palworld mining bitcoin in the background classic
[3:38:39] donkarkinoss: calm down guys she is getting help :)
[3:38:39] mavericks312: she has a tech she can call

[3:39:17] Kevie70: she needs to go to OBS studio
[3:39:24] Phasehero: Her brainwaves. Maybe use that term for RP @acie

[4:06:32] Alaineman: Eugene can probably use the coins later for the HQ app
[4:06:34] topmiddle: bad that the coins are not so useful yet

[4:07:54] JoEaas191: @p10_tenzo OMEGALUL
[4:07:57] TheMrWiik: things will probably cost 100-1000 coins each

[4:08:05] Wulfruna8: I'd be like, "You think these things grow on trees?"
[4:08:06] 42arc: coins = passive income Pepega
[4:08:08] Slaydess7: true
[4:08:09] gerdronex: has Jason ever mentioned what he plans to do with all that money?
[4:08:10] mectuka: invest more in weed
[4:08:11] formerly31sloths: grinditis
[4:08:12] Tenivir: yeah its gonna be more about farming for yourself at this point, wont be any margins
[4:08:18] DaveShadows: MONKA rick gonna come for us again
[4:08:19] ToTheSameHeights: already was
[4:08:21] formerly31sloths: Rick Grinds is coming

[4:08:26] Zeynlol: he is not thinking ahead with the coins
[4:08:27] 42arc: you need more
[4:08:27] fluxNikko: try to buy a shop and sell furniture
[4:08:28] Z3phs: weed is the money maker now i guess
[4:08:30] linkedupbunk: Stockpile coins
[4:08:32] AlexNattes: Rick grind will kill the gang
[4:08:33] DeeZhuL: devs are late on updates
[4:08:33] h0lk1: there will be more expensive apps, he needs to understand that tbh
[4:08:35] Karmas_Weapon: Yuno kind of started this LuL  hopefully it pushes the dev to release more content
[4:08:37] azumibg: all together sell weed
[4:08:37] aaz9: 100 coins is like 80 grand
[4:08:38] BlindFlapjack: Jason killed his own market letting everyone know about the big GPUs
[4:08:38] 1_bex: you could invest in the weed guy in hq app
[4:08:38] xLOWxKEYx: that’s probably a good problem to have for the future
[4:08:41] Roro_____: if you sell coins for 800 each thats crazy money
[4:08:41] MrMingy: longer term they’ll definitely be useful
[4:08:44] RealWicari: -30 per week for the weed guy, he doesnt understand how much coin the HQ app uses
[4:08:51] nuhbinho: fill your racks and then start selling blueprints every day
[4:08:51] Terrous10: coins will be worth alot latter, just bank as much as you can
[4:08:53] TheMrWiik: hes too focused on the current uses
[4:08:58] gerdronex: no way they are selling anything at this point
[4:09:00] Frostring: gotta just always be looking for customers
[4:09:02] Zeynlol: if house robbing comes and it is 50 coins per you will need a shit ton
[4:09:05] skybriifan: What up gorgeous 😍
[4:09:07] catquickspider: the company probably has secrets not willing to tell
[4:09:08] fluxNikko: flip houses
[4:09:16] matador_9999: JASON CANNOT SEE 1 DAY INTO THE FUTURE ITS NOW OR NEVER
[4:09:18] AFFABLE__: Not if you buy all the apps on all 3 pcs and fill all racks with 6060s
[4:09:19] Z3phs: the thing about the coins is, you have no clue if the next unlock needs 10 coins or 100 coins... depending on that... everything will change
[4:09:23] Albsxk: bro what are these first time chatters??
[4:09:28] 42arc: you need all 10 racks maxed asap
[4:09:31] Dantan310: yes get more coin production
[4:09:35] 1_bex: house robbing will probably cost coins
[4:09:44] Blazentreez: they are recking nopixel with the super slow drip feed of new things and nerfing anything good
[4:09:46] TheMrWiik: they need 128 racks
[4:09:48] ToTheSameHeights: having infinite passive income with coins

[4:09:56] h0lk1: you probably need coin
[4:09:56] Ezzroo: Surely there will something in future where it will cost 100 butcoin
[4:10:02] CRlCK: @skybriifan Hello
[4:10:12] Tenivir: Blazentreez yeah some stuff is unlocking a bit too slow atm, atleast with how much people play
[4:10:13] gerdronex: what for? you gotta invest all that money on something
[4:10:14] Z3phs: if the next unlock needs like 100 coins, everyone will want to buy coins off you. if it takes no coins, everyone will have enough and its a different market
[4:10:17] 42arc: it's passive income in futur,e you should be making pc+racks in every apartment and farming coins
[4:10:20] Zeynlol: ofc they will inflate the btc costs for shit
[4:10:20] linkedupbunk: Would probably be smart to plan for the future by upgrading the racks
[4:10:22] skybriifan: @crlck hi hi
[4:10:31] EZOBOSS: @Acie Think of the passive revenue, farming coins is sick 10 coins is 8k per day. Ramp that up

[4:10:37] tanya_le_: acieWIGGLE2

[4:10:55] Alaineman: Keeping a nice and healthy butcoin backup for new unlocks is the play i feel
[4:11:06] officialpixelrejects: @CRlCK u should build one
[4:11:08] catquickspider: coins will probably be needed for heists
[4:11:20] gerdronex: bro thinks he's the only one with money
[4:11:27] TheMrWiik: see too little
[4:11:31] CRlCK: i'm watching stream on my nintendo wii
[4:11:31] 71490twitch: this is the normal way you shoud be looking for the next trend to sell it first
[4:11:32] Wulfruna8: 10 big ones Brows
[4:11:36] DylBKR: It wont be 100coins for anything yet they've slowed roll outs massively in 4.0
[4:11:37] PrettyKrazy: HUH ??? you what
[4:11:40] AlexNattes: Little business problem pepeLost
[4:11:46] andrefvm: Just fulfill the order over a couple days

[4:11:51] maikkekku: Take half monet before and rest on delivery
[4:11:52] TheMrWiik: c4, grappling hooks will probably be like 1000 coins
[4:11:55] 42arc: why not making more racks???
[4:11:59] IClaytec: i mean you could sell some coins then an get the money back
[4:12:08] Tenivir: those kinda big orders get increasingly risky with setups etc

[5:15:17] StreamElements: Do not share in-game information regarding other players/content creators. Acie doesn't want to know and this can instead harm in-game decisions. This may result to a time out or ban without warning. (Meta-gaming is when you tell Acie what a different streamer is doing on the same server) Thank you.

[6:24:43] Neon_crunch: the rate of weight loss slows because you are at a lower BMR (basal metabolic rate- the energy needed to maintain if you just did nothing all day). this decreases because there is less body mass to maintain. so the amount of calories you need to cut out to lose the same amount  of weight as before at your higher weight increases. so the lower weight you are, the harder it is to lose weight. @acie
