[3:36:08] PeachTwirl: I try to scroll past them on TikTok but then i end up stopping anyways and listening to the entire thing
[3:36:46] Tyler4AM: I like the ones on the relationship advice subreddit where it's just screenshots of text conversations that are the most unhinged shit you'll ever read

[3:38:44] Tyler4AM: Oh god dude, it's people being like "hey looking for advice, got into a bit of a tiff with my significant other" and then you read what their partner said and they're like flipping their shit texting essays about why not having the toilet paper the right way is making them want to get a divorce
[3:39:08] inus2: the gta rp subreddit is pretty funny to read sometimes, someone will comment something like "this was really cool rp glad to see x person is enjoying this so much" and then there will be a dozen replies telling them they are wrong/stupid in paragraph format

[3:40:10] wizardiis: KEKW
[3:40:16] PeachTwirl: KEKW
[3:40:33] Tyler4AM: Honestly Kiva I really hated when you provided RP for a bunch of people at the end of 3.0 when things were super slow
[3:40:33] GD_Kotorou: There is always someone being stupid at the bottom of a thread downvoted to hell lol
[3:40:38] Tyler4AM: That was pretty dumb
[3:40:44] Necro_Ex_Mortis: Lol theres always one.
[3:40:53] inus2: yeah sort by controversial or w/e is the best way to enjoy the rp subreddit
[3:41:02] inus2: there's some gems in each thread
[3:41:40] inus2: oh yeah I saw that comment, the 'ooc hate wall' was wild
[3:41:51] honor234567: oof i rember reading that it was rough
[3:41:56] Tyler4AM: My favorite times reading that subreddit are when people try to speak for Siz/James and then he just says fuck it and responds to them being like "No, you're wrong and dumb"
[3:42:10] inus2: whats even better are the youtube comments though
[3:42:16] inus2: the ones during the casino were legit insane
[3:42:31] PeachTwirl: i avoid YouTube comments like the plague

[3:59:01] TraumaLlama: I'm still holding out hope for new Darker than Black that will never happen -_-

[4:01:23] maova: So much on their animators but they are sooo good
[4:01:34] Vizi797: KEKW
[4:01:36] Tyler4AM: HUH
[4:01:37] Anrisacia: Game of Thrones is one of those for me. It was definitely good and I enjoyed it, but it feels like I don't like it as much as I should with the way people talk about it
[4:01:42] Matenkai: think i read somewhere some of jujutsu kaisens episodes had only 24H of work on them cause how how time crunched they were
[4:01:42] Madam_Orange: KEKW

[4:02:54] Madam_Orange: oh I bet it is Tyler it was all over the internet
[4:03:11] Rablit: Absolutely. It ain't worth it no more.
[4:03:24] inus2: I had read the books prior to the series coming out so I couldn't really get into the tv show as much
[4:03:30] inus2: I did enjoy the books a lot though
[4:05:47] maova: Omg solo leveling recently is a grind to read
[4:06:02] bYpsheep: its a super power creep fantasy

[4:06:15] Madam_Orange: yeah he changes a lot LUL

[4:06:55] Tyler4AM: I feel bad cause I don't really know anything about any of these lol
[4:07:08] Madam_Orange: I suppose actually increasing your stats would change you a lot

[4:08:12] Madam_Orange: I can’t watch fire force
[4:08:26] Madam_Orange: the fan service is SO BAD
[4:08:41] AdamElJefe: @elvic_ the fan scervice ruins the show

[4:13:54] DentonTYoung: i still have the cartoon so its ok
[4:13:56] Glastum_: that bar is on the floor
[4:14:01] Jeycoil: i was apprehensive of one piece until that came out but i'm more apprehensive of this
[4:14:05] maova: Ive heard things that its going off script
[4:14:06] Tyler4AM: Listen I wish they didn't touch it at all but if they're gonna do it, it better be good
[4:14:06] opalducky: That bar is in hell
[4:14:11] elvic_: I have hope for it but i heard they already changed some stuff from the show. gotta be a reason the original creators left while making it
[4:14:12] Purpurescent: They at least pronounced Aang correctly this time

[4:15:08] TraumaLlama: You mentioned netflix... Now all I can think of for some reason is that death note movie they released
[4:15:36] Tyler4AM: The death note movie is a work of art
[4:15:41] crossfoxdm: I’m so salty about how they handled The Witcher
[4:15:41] Thrath: I am so glad I never watched the death note movie
[4:15:42] opalducky: The one piece series did good
[4:15:43] Matenkai: im still mad at netflix for henry cavil -_-
[4:15:43] Tyler4AM: It takes real effort to fuck something up that badly
[4:15:44] xXJDOGXx17: I've only herd bad things about it Netflix did Netflix things and killed it
[4:15:44] Madam_Orange: I already prefer animation as a medium soooo
[4:15:54] maova: What do you mean? You don't want team avatar traveling around Europe?
[4:16:05] AdamElJefe: nah live action One Piece is great
[4:16:21] Tyler4AM: One Piece LA felt super extra, but I kinda enjoyed that
[4:16:36] Madam_Orange: I enjoyed it
[4:16:50] TraumaLlama: Then again, I'm an outlier and actually enjoyed the Live action Cowboy bebop so...
[4:17:13] Thrath: Don't know if this will make sense but there is some shows that just do better as animation and when they get made live action the feel more weird
[4:17:13] Itistoybtw: i wish they add on to that universe
[4:17:14] DentonTYoung: NODDERS
[4:17:30] Tyler4AM: Best I can do is Avatar on Ice sponsored by Disney
[4:17:44] maova: King bumi and aang side story plz
[4:18:33] maova: A White Lotus series would be so nice
[4:18:37] Itistoybtw: i have a friend the first conversatoin we had was hey you should watch the whole avatar series after that watch kora
[4:18:58] Itistoybtw: now shes one of my bestfriends
[4:19:43] Itistoybtw: or a fire nation series
[4:19:49] AdamElJefe: See, these are all much better ideas than what Netflix is doing
[4:19:52] Itistoybtw: more fillers
[4:19:53] AdamElJefe: they should hire you
[4:21:04] TraumaLlama: As long as they stay away from .hack Im good.
[4:21:07] lowbow_: I never watched Korra
[4:21:30] maova: I feel like White Lotus series for Avatar is like a Marauders series for Harry Potter
[4:21:42] sage40k: korra got screwed by the network
[4:21:43] crossfoxdm: Nickelodeon did season 4 dirty
[4:21:46] maova: We all want it but it feels so far away
[4:21:48] Steambottom: what kind of bender would you want to be?
[4:21:51] AdamElJefe: I just applaud some of the creativity that the benders have in Korra, good stuff
[4:22:11] TraumaLlama: Did you ever see that trailer that was released for a live action Akira.. That was a dope trailer, think it got cancelled though
[4:22:41] AdamElJefe: Season 3 was dope tho

[4:26:59] crossfoxdm: the books get… wild
[4:27:15] inus2: kind of game of thrones in space, at least early on in the book series kivaLUL
[4:27:41] Tyler4AM: All I know is it's directed by Denis Villeneuve who also did Blade Runner 2049, which is an incredible movie
[4:27:55] Random_Slacker: dune part 1 was great.. tho got super annoyed at the end when I realised it was just part 1, hah.. went into it blind
[4:28:34] opalducky: The fact that they harp on water being in blood made me immediately think of ice shards kivaM
