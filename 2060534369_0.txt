[4:44:49] JaeMendo: Packer is 1000 right?
[4:44:51] Mixcy9: 500kg is the legal limit
[4:44:57] DarthRadonis: maybe they are encouraging people to slow down in the trucks Hmmm
[4:45:10] Wo7lf1: So u would be able to buy larger licenses ?
[4:45:11] Mixcy9: The trunk also say 3000kg
[4:45:17] Mixcy9: But only have 40 slots
[4:45:18] kuwwoo: license limit toonyHmm Hmmm
[4:45:33] Mixcy9: So you can't transport more than 2000kg
[4:45:33] mark_ap1103: @Gotgold ye i think bcz people just throw away many packages in dumpsters
[4:45:35] Siup12: Naw makes them go back and stop the grind of just keep collecting. Just like life

[4:46:23] Wo7lf1: unless u can buy bigger licenses
[4:46:29] dank0m0de: even irl 500kg is nothing
[4:46:30] Gotgold: there is a way to make it make sense tho
[4:46:30] kuwwoo: fines for cops i guess Shruge
[4:46:32] DarthRadonis: cause you cant drive a Semi with out a CDL
[4:46:34] Wo7lf1: that u can show the cops
[4:46:45] Siup12: Bigger trucks will have more
[4:46:48] spittin77: License upgrades to carry more weight?
[4:46:51] Siup12: I hope
[4:46:51] Mixcy9: The packer license is 1000 kg
[4:47:12] Wo7lf1: @spittin77 Yeah that makes most sense
[4:47:19] dragonesk22: 500kg is like a tub filled with water lmao. it’s nothing
[4:47:21] Mixcy9: So to be legal you can do 1 gas station ; everything after that is illegal
[4:47:29] Danteroth: Why not check the grime van's legal limit because your theory that it's per contract makes sense
[4:47:44] Mixcy9: Yeah it doesn't
[4:48:02] kuwwoo: Maybe you can now upgrade your license limit somewhere Hmmm HmmgeSit

[4:49:00] Mixcy9: @DarthRadonis The big problem is also the trunk only have 40 slots
