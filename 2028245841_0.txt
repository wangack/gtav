[4:15:49] muhammedxlut: you'll have better luck interacting than sitting on a train
[4:15:53] DonRager: how about u run for mayor LOOOL
[4:15:55] stnash52: then when they check stream and see you on your own for 4 hours doesn‚Äôt look great
[4:16:02] NonStopGam3r: Ye atleast anyone who is getting on is giving you a +1
[4:16:15] benreed9: I feel like getting +1s from random people is worth more then someone like Swizz giving it to you
[4:16:20] rezijard: @DonRager KEKW
[4:16:45] Hilfenhaus: Gotta bring a character with the rp around the business
[4:16:53] NonStopGam3r: She wrote you a paragraph too
[4:17:33] NonStopGam3r: Like 2-3 mins of constant typing she covered what she said cause it was private to her
[4:17:43] GoodShutHazUK: if you get +1 is it instant you get in or is it long ?
[4:17:48] benreed9: You got 2 +1s that day and still haven‚Äôt got it idk what more you can do but carry on with the metro stuff
[4:18:10] CheffZed: u saw on twatter a mayor was in legion u just need to be proactive

[4:18:22] rezijard: yea
[4:18:23] razatlab2000: just need everyone to be awake at the same time fot the heist
[4:18:47] stnash52: interacting with a variety of ppl is the way not the same ppl all the time
[4:19:00] NonStopGam3r: The thing is it may not be appealing to viewers but when your doing cool stuff in NA they will appreciate what you had to do
[4:19:14] m_1ne: it could be tho there‚Äôs a lot of potential with the trains
[4:19:41] rezijard: nodd
[4:19:56] NonStopGam3r: The thing is that 1 person on the train made a full night of RP
[4:20:24] CheffZed: u need to make the interest and use yp
[4:20:29] benreed9: If you get in na you literally need to just interact with as many people as possible and not waste it
[4:20:32] stnash52: then make a reason people want to go there
[4:21:04] rezijard: o
[4:21:07] rezijard: LMAO
[4:21:14] rexyyyy_: loooool
[4:21:41] m_1ne: With a good business plan the mayor might be willing to get better construction for it especially if it promotes a ton of rp
[4:22:17] rexyyyy_: icl you shine more when you‚Äôre doing solo stuff which is why I been begging for it LUL
[4:22:22] Liam528623: people will just rent a car it‚Äôs cheap and easier than waiting for train
[4:22:28] NonStopGam3r: Think the fighting clips and stuff on twatter will bring people
[4:22:33] redcristalefx: imagine all this planning for the train to scuff when it actually happensüíÄüíÄ
