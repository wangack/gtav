[6:30:40] craftsmankj1: @travpiper the house I live in has a 3-4 acre pond with bass, brim, and some carp. I lost my favorite lure, which was a simple metal minnow with a simple propellor-like spinner. I can't find one like it!

[6:32:05] Bulfwyne: i gotta
[6:32:21] craftsmankj1: No... the spinner was a little bit behind the lure... maybe it wasn't a prop. No, it wasn't a prop because when it'd get a piece of grass on it it wouldn't spin right
[6:32:33] Bulfwyne: the underspins i make have been really neat
[6:33:13] craftsmankj1: But every spinner I've gotten since then has a fucking annoying ass feather on it that the treble gets caught up on all the time
[6:33:15] Bulfwyne: PogU ??
[6:33:18] sucio71989: Pog
[6:33:32] Bulfwyne: ahhh ... you'll need soem ventilation for that

[6:34:12] ChineseVendor: can’t you use print a picture of a bait? does it not work that way?
[6:34:24] craftsmankj1: I'm afraid to use anything that sits on the bottom because I have no clue what's on the bottom of this pond
[6:34:42] ky05uk3: travpiWIGGLE travpiWIGGLE travpiWIGGLE
[6:34:45] craftsmankj1: I can only assume a shit ton of beaver branches and leaves

[6:36:28] sucio71989: LUL
[6:36:31] craftsmankj1: I tried worms and bobbers once. That only caught the brim
[6:36:40] kidweezler_: LMAO
[6:36:49] Bulfwyne: yea snags around that are a pain @craftsmankj1 cause even texas rigging a worm will get caught up at times but thats why it'd be great to use a fish finder that can show the bottom

[6:39:14] MistaJingles: ive caught a fishing pole and a shoe before
[6:39:18] craftsmankj1: @bulfwyne I've had to walk into the water once to get a lure out of a tree... yeah I know... but the bottom is super soft because of all the leaves. One foot sank and I fell backwards
