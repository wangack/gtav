[0:47:07] gumby_did_it2: shotz5150 timmacBANG
[0:47:22] vipersummer: or was it more of the situation

[0:49:32] QuesoCommander: would be nice if there's more demand for neutral parties in the future, keeps things interesting vs every group doing their own thing
[0:49:47] FreddNET: Yeah its nice to have connections, and you can charge a fee for every gun you make.
[0:49:54] jimothy64: While getting into guns might be accessible, might prove hard for everyone to *stay* in for some people once raids start happening...
[0:50:11] ghostpw: free info
[0:50:17] JoeayIV: tariffs on crossing the border to paleto

[0:50:47] retrowolf0498: Could ask if you can use it if you guys have the materials.
[0:50:54] QuesoCommander: also generally the one supplying guns is less likely to get shot by them
[0:50:55] gumby_did_it2: nakkiPopcorn

[0:53:19] jimothy64: At the same time, that's kind of the balance of having a neutral party handling it.. it'll be curious to see what they want essentially
[0:54:00] tyty3156: probably sleeping in there bed
[0:54:02] eh_side: I guess it's tough to know until you see it, but I wonder if the gun blueprint has unlimited or limited uses. That would change a lot of how the arrangement would work.
[0:54:07] gumby_did_it2: FortOne
[0:54:17] tyty3156: they were up and didn‚Äôt get to do the heist
[0:54:31] retrowolf0498: My guess is limited but high yield limited @eh_side

[1:00:42] ApocAFK: One of the people in my FF14 company was complaining that it's not going to be a 1 to 1 copy of the show
[1:00:46] Codingale: It's the internet, they love to rage lol
[1:01:09] ApocAFK: They were SO MAD that Sokka isn't gonna be as much as a misogynist
[1:01:37] vipersummer: because some people cant exist without something to be angry about even if its something dumb
[1:02:03] ApocAFK: 'it's such a big part of his character' but they never stop to think that they could do something new that is still good

[1:47:36] nobodybodon: hmjj are we trying to give people motion sickness? is that why you keep switching back and forth from first person?
[1:47:38] Codingale: @brikbeans sorry just saw this, but back in 3.0 I swear female peds randomly lost health for no reason; everytime I used one it'd make me just slowly die from air

[1:48:41] retrowolf0498: Cars parked along the inside of the corners to get people off them periodically would be smart.
[1:49:49] JoeayIV: strafing?
[1:50:01] JoeayIV: like first person and going left instead of forwards
[1:50:03] QuesoCommander: thought the swapping was sweaty because you can juke easier
[1:50:18] nobodybodon: I think those people are confused, because first person is used in speedrunning, but when you can chose your run anim you can just choose one thats faster than the first person run

[1:58:28] reckless_gm: Ask them pre race which run they are gonna do and set odds based off that maybe?
[2:00:39] tasteliketaro: have human obstacles tackling and the horses have to dodge
[2:01:02] QuesoCommander: make it so that halfway through they have to funnel into it or something
[2:01:41] jessiegreen: can you use a cone
[2:02:42] d_u_d_e____: more obstacles in inner circle
[2:03:00] QuesoCommander: ain't no way anyone is keeping track of that
[2:03:14] vipersummer: wait. do the horses stay in lanes in horse racing?
[2:03:20] phvny: no just have the finish lines scattered
[2:03:27] phvny: thats how its done in real life
[2:03:36] phvny: i mean start lines
[2:03:51] QuesoCommander: they start even pretty sure
[2:03:53] Codingale: Don't Olympic runs do diagonal starts?
[2:03:59] super_lb97: cant do that tho in racing closer to the fence is shorter way around its not fair to hold people on the outsides
[2:04:11] MadRodsta: random barrier draw, but start in a straight line.
[2:04:14] knowing147: dont they have speed tests to see whos fastest, then the fastest gets the longest treck?
[2:04:16] donaldmashburn: Fastest towards outer and slower towards inner
[2:04:17] Codingale: yeah what he's saying for people but horses don't
[2:04:18] vipersummer: i think they line up in a line
[2:04:36] ingridktravels: Malakai is talking about track and field.  Otherwise they all go out a gate
[2:04:37] QuesoCommander: whoever gets to the corner first has the advantage - slightly easier for those on the inside
[2:04:42] TheJRoller: They have to qualify for their starting gate
[2:04:42] Blunderbusses: stagger start is for humans on an actual human track
[2:04:47] Codingale: You must give names to everyone, one must be called Little Biscuit
[2:04:49] Blunderbusses: running 200, 400
[2:04:54] ingridktravels: it is just luck of the draw
[2:05:00] retrowolf0498: Put locked cars on the inside of the corners to make people move around the track?
[2:05:21] jessiegreen: they he think track race they not all in streat line
[2:05:26] super_lb97: cause the start like tha tbut they all compact down inthe first corner to the bottem
[2:05:47] QuesoCommander: the side of the track is really long, a diagonal going from the outside to the inside isn't *that* much farther than the straight
[2:05:58] super_lb97: use to bet horses alot lol heheh fun times

[2:08:47] QuesoCommander: if the start is farther from the turn, it wouldn't make much of a difference where you start

[2:14:02] Rekonin: And people would pick up multiple to screw other over; how would you police that
