[3:19:16] Athasin: @TheMrGromble No it doesn't, it actually makes cop RP more interesting. Cops need to actually do police work, get CI's, get leads, collect DNA etc.
[3:19:17] Nintail: These are the same cars, they are not upgraded yet?
[3:19:17] Trixcross: you would've got the arrest and that's good for promo which is good RP @deansocool

[3:23:41] AsuniRS: just shoot on sight :tf:
[3:23:42] Thrand1: yea, for sure was super entertaining to watch
[3:23:43] marneraiders: @deansocool Positive Side of the new Civ Cars: No more calling off pursuits for being to reckless LUL There won’t be a pursuit if their VCB in the first 2 seconds
[3:23:44] eFiend: do the cops for 100% know that it was Nunu, they only heard the name tatyana
[3:23:46] AteeqR4F33: Aziz is emotional right now but he's good
[3:23:47] DavidB_43: Dang I missed it, need to watch it later
[3:23:48] Milo_lul: call Aziz he is crying SAJ
[3:23:49] Athasin: @greedb0rne They're mentally ill and want a vicarious win
[3:23:50] charybdes: yep, disappointed sub for you, lost the rp you could have had if you caught her. You already had a long ass chase.
[3:23:51] EGGZOLENTZ: @deansocool you prefer noy straight dono of cash right

[3:23:57] DeoNone: yeah that would be so boring
[3:23:57] Real_Bugz: aziz got emotional just now. brought me to tears
[3:23:59] detergent86: I mean if a viewer has like two or three free hours to watch a stream, they just wanna see some action. it’s hard to watch 15+ hours a day trying to catch some action. I’ll have a bunch of streams running and kinda jump around as something happens.
[3:24:01] macneutron: Most are parasocials they live their lives through the streamers, their streamer getting an L is like them getting the L
[3:24:03] blackjack84: wtf
[3:24:08] psxgamer12: True noraexL
[3:24:08] BIumenT0pF: @eFiend no they dont know it was her

[3:24:13] AteeqR4F33: Aziz got man tearing up
[3:24:14] LukeH1992: i mean gta is a sim lol
[3:24:17] leo_bwo: Its obvious that crims have WAY more to lose from getting caught than PD has losing a chase, so i can kinda see why people would get mad, but who tf is gonna go to another channel to be mad about it lmfao
[3:24:21] park_ji_sung_: 6 what?
[3:24:24] xdxxn: SCHIZO
[3:24:26] Paragaming09: it is  a simulation monkaS
[3:24:26] Gachiguru: @blument0pf they got positive ID from Clayton
[3:24:30] nathanmcg20: did you like the chase with Doug and his mate yesterday
[3:24:31] Athasin: @apologetic76 When they tackle a cop, and once she kidnapped the cop they could, which is why Aziz pulled it on her when she got in the pink car
[3:24:31] beberocker: @efiend they have no confirmation yet aziz is responding officer
[3:24:33] BeeezyBoi: that car seems cracked
[3:24:36] Trixcross: lmaooo simulation in GTA
[3:24:39] SuuWasTaken: Baader-Meinhof phenomenon
[3:24:43] xypher85: Aziz got me tearing up
[3:24:50] eFiend: @beberocker yeah cool
[3:24:58] LokiTheElusive: How do you have positive ID from Clayton did he tell?
[3:24:59] Rootbritney: Did Clayton say the woman behind the pole was Nunu?
[3:25:00] R5F_: Hmm
[3:25:00] BDG_Toa676: Wait what happened Xypher
[3:25:02] kalash7it: Do the PD know it was Nora ?
[3:25:02] ElMedinaPR: Aziz got me tearing up too
[3:25:04] MisterBrojangles: @macneutron you aint lying. Like their entire life revolves around THIS ONE CHARACTER. If they lose or get shot, that person feels personally attacked and has to lash out at other streamers.
[3:25:05] Athasin: @Athasin Unfortunately the pink car ran him over before he could get a shot
[3:25:05] joosh1806: does den zel 100% know it’s her that ran?
[3:25:06] tuffyyxd: @deansocool does that mean tess wanted since vehicle registered to her?
[3:25:07] wispamii: @greedb0rne cause whats the point of having a gun if you aren’t gonna use it? there were means to shoot. cops chases happen like 10 times a day. would have been better to shoot if you have means. they’re too strict with the gun usage from the captains. from a content perspective, would have been nice to see them win. and i hate cops irl lmao
[3:25:07] naveenmani: didnt she use a voice changer
[3:25:09] DrShreyWay: @SuuWasTaken lmaoo i was gonna say that
[3:25:11] Gachiguru: @LokiTheElusive at chumash earlier
[3:25:12] Defonicx: repeating that fact is going to upset people PoroSad
[3:25:20] xypher85: @BDG_Toa676 really emotional cause of subs
[3:25:20] Clue13: Clayton said nunu left.
[3:25:22] alisoq: theyre playing a game called grand theft auto and you got people triggered about rp rules and shit. have fun.
[3:25:29] BDG_Toa676: Ahh
[3:25:31] joster124: @Deansocool its the red car theory , you dont know how many red cars you pass by , but when someone ask you to look for red cars you will find a lot cuz you actively searching for them
[3:25:32] eFiend: solid conclusion
[3:25:33] joosh1806: valid
[3:25:35] AsuniRS: can you put the mugging on her too? the one you initially went there for
[3:25:35] R5F_: Wont work is court prolly
[3:25:35] wazzaww: Haha surely
[3:25:35] Usahi_Light: i dont think itll stick but im interested to se eif it does
[3:25:36] MDM4ever1986HD: @alisoq 100%
[3:25:37] Athasin: That's not a positive ID brody but if you can articulate to Capt to get a warrant sure
[3:25:39] AbeFroman2: hmm but if thats his partner was it his partner at that moment
[3:25:40] LokiTheElusive: True, Clayton also said that Nunu left earlier and he was running on his own though
[3:25:40] Kevie70: Need more than that
[3:25:45] Thrand1: Will that hold up in court tho if you never did get them? but that may work out for the PD I think
[3:25:45] Bjuris611: Don't think that holds up in court
[3:25:45] Gachiguru: @R5F_ 100% will work in court
[3:25:46] BIumenT0pF: so whats the timeline there ? i mean its logical but will it hold up in court ?
[3:25:49] Thrand1: I know Court is finicky
[3:25:51] EGGZOLENTZ: @xypher85 check your in box
[3:25:53] scootypebbles92: G6 Manager also claimed the name she was using wasn't on the roster list.

[3:54:37] Trixcross: Ramee's taking so many retainers he's probably unable to take so many cases
[3:54:37] thricerice1: You more likely get 10 daps than catch her
[3:54:39] Gachiguru: it should just refresh if they do something else

[5:54:47] auxfrog: she did try to report it
[5:54:47] Nickomongo: @timcollinn theyre saying its not valid

[5:55:43] bobbybeee: tess isnt even detained right now either right?
[5:55:46] Evezh_: did the pd cars ever get fixed?
[5:55:47] ScreenFresh: it showed no tampering
[5:55:50] jimmijustice: She needs to see a jail cell
[5:55:56] kb420ps: If this goes to court,  Tess will win.  It's not her fault that their 911 system is a joke. No time stamp!?!?!???  That's complete BS.
[5:55:58] azmer1987: Don't arrest my streamer. I love her Kappa
[5:56:00] guzeriz: @mcdevil1988 and this is not jsut RP, PD scaning plates is game mechanic
[5:56:00] Juhoze: @mcdevil1988 No she didnt, she thought she did, she did it incorrectly
[5:56:01] Tresch: W stuff all around

[5:56:07] RoninSisu: Is her DNA on file?
[5:56:13] scootypebbles92: @kb420ps calm down
[5:56:14] guzeriz: @mcdevil1988 you need to reprot it to PD for it to be flagged stolen.
[5:56:15] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: W
[5:56:20] Lungss_: because she was held at knife point and they took the keys
[5:56:20] vstifler_: @kb420ps relax buddy
[5:56:24] Viwie: why would there be tampering though? if she was forced to give them keys
[5:56:24] sharrkuu: wouldn't have been tampered if she gave thee keys when held up would it?
[5:56:24] ImEmanGaming: @azmer1987 consolatory deansoCD
[5:56:25] Tresch: no stabbing, no shooting just entertaiment
[5:56:25] macneutron: @MatscherPlatscher no, only on objects picked from the ground
[5:56:27] dillon_619: been watching all day and have to say it’s been fun to watch
[5:56:28] Roro_____: what tempering? she said 2 people told her to get out and give keys adn stoel it
[5:56:29] MDM4ever1986HD: what's the $600 fine for anyway?
[5:56:30] RagoDK: is it like in 3.0 the longer the car is in impoud the less the price it will be?
[5:56:30] FossilizedWalrus: so OOC, her story about being held by knife and giving the keys away how would that not work?
[5:56:31] AsuniRS: no time stamp vs no tampering, i wonder which will hold more weight
[5:56:32] mcdevil1988: @Juhoze ahh, ok.. sry I did not know that she fucked up
[5:56:32] Stenner1998: honestly this calls for a 24hr hold
[5:56:34] amal99jacob: what did tess do?
[5:56:35] delinquentgains: what if she got carjacked
[5:56:40] azmer1987: @kb420ps probably on purpose it was abused for the past 3 releases
[5:56:45] blackops567: aziz so good at reports
[5:56:47] guzeriz: @mcdevil1988 and even if it was stolen its still was used in evading felony
[5:56:48] Topking10: 24 HOUR HOLD LOL
[5:56:48] Whistlebeak: felony yapping
[5:56:50] binzenoo: how much the fine?
[5:56:55] miniPB: she said held at knife point I thought
[5:56:56] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: towed then ocean dumped sadge
[5:56:57] mcdevil1988: @guzeriz ok did not know that she fucked it up
[5:56:58] theholyster: Deanieweeny
[5:57:00] xsilas43: She failed to properly report even if it was stolen
[5:57:09] theholyster: new setup!?!?!?!?
[5:57:10] BlueDream699: yup
[5:57:12] Maukomatic: It's missing 2 doors, how would you see signs of tampering on the doors
[5:57:14] escokitty: the 911 system is flawed
[5:57:14] metkucki: aaaah i see
[5:57:16] Turboz__: what it not be pd job to call her to meet for a report
[5:57:17] Rascal_PM: if someone was held up with a weapon they should have said that
[5:57:18] FossilizedWalrus: so the 911 call basically doesn't matter until the report is filed?
[5:57:21] mcdevil1988: @guzeriz yeah but that is not her fault, is it?
[5:57:23] azmer1987: Based
[5:57:24] jimmijustice: she deff was helping
[5:57:28] guzeriz: @Turboz__ nope
[5:57:31] big_kriss: so if she reported it correctly it would have been fine
[5:57:33] Frog69: @Turboz__ ? its not pd's car omE2
[5:57:33] MatscherPlatscher: isnt that game mechanic fuckery?
[5:57:34] wooodenleg: how would she know the proper way of reporting?
[5:57:35] RYANizee: and as Nekoda said not coming to mrpd means that it isn’t legal report
[5:57:36] BerryG_333: At that point was it too late to create the police report?
[5:57:37] Stjilly: she reported it and no one called her tho?
[5:57:38] azmer1987: @escokitty no it isn't. Works perfect
[5:57:38] ScreenFresh: @Maukomatic its a mechanic cops can see if its been tampered with ie lockpicked stolen etc
[5:57:38] ImEmanGaming: @fossilizedwalrus for stolen cars
[5:57:39] aurice_heartly: be sure to let her know that the vehicle will also be detained for 24hrs so that she can know the severity
[5:57:44] FossilizedWalrus: makes sense, thanks
[5:57:48] guzeriz: @mcdevil1988 sure, but the car will be impounded as evidence and put a fine on it
[5:57:49] kb420ps: If this goes to court,  you're gonna lose.  I'd be willing to take that bet.
[5:57:53] aineko2010: yeah but PD should be the one responsible for following up on a 911, no?
[5:57:55] Curaheee: so what if it was actually stolen, asking out of rp
[5:57:55] sharrkuu: what if there are no cops because they are all in the chase?
[5:57:57] momzzyy: how would you know how to report it the proper way?
[5:58:00] Maukomatic: Ah of course the ignition @screenfresh
[5:58:02] GooFProoF_: ????
[5:58:04] macneutron: @MatscherPlatscher yeah, but u are supposed to roll with the RP
[5:58:07] ali5338: essaying

[5:58:17] azmer1987: @curaheee they wouldn't have seen her than lol
[5:58:22] BerryG_333: When she talked to you about it at the traffic stop was it too late to do the report?
[5:58:22] mcdevil1988: @guzeriz alright, understood.. but thats on nunu then I guess
[5:58:24] MDM4ever1986HD: Love new chat being curious too
[5:58:37] guzeriz: @mcdevil1988 they dont know it was nunu
[5:58:40] jimmijustice: she is in possession
[5:58:41] Rascal_PM: you should document everything Dean. we need to win a case bro deansoCozy deansoCozy deansoCozy deansoCozy
[5:58:41] judgement_12: you can argue it wasn’t done right, but you would have to prove she lied about it so this bench won’t be won, but if the impound happens that makes sense
[5:58:44] cSandu1: mhm
[5:58:47] BadNewsBorris: You're the GOAT Dean! I love watching you and Denzel! Appreciate the content bro :D

[5:58:59] Lungss_: whats the point of 911 if you cant call it
[5:59:01] mcdevil1988: @guzeriz yes, all I am saying with that, is that nunu is paying tess afterwards, hopefully
[5:59:02] macneutron: @guzeriz they know
[5:59:10] FossilizedWalrus: this whole scenario has been great RP from all involved though
[5:59:12] azmer1987: @sharrkuu they have around 20+ or try to abd adding way more they will be alright
[5:59:16] voffsing: Who is this woman?
