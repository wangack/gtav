[2:22:59] Fishnet83: @WolfOfWotan Communication missing as with everything else going on the last few days classic
[2:23:07] kpiggyyy: proper chanels
[2:23:08] luvvkoa: ur right
[2:23:08] WolfOfWotan: @Fishnet83 true
[2:23:10] EleWiggle: mhm
[2:23:12] lsn_____: wrong
[2:23:13] SameAsEveryOtherDay: The group's weed -> the group's turf -> the group's money run
[2:23:14] N_eel: fohead makes 300 per brick of weed he sells, is that enough to warrant a tax?
[2:23:23] VADICKUS007: @stocker218 thanks for the advice LUL
[2:23:23] rosco2357: If even future does why wouldn't they
[2:23:38] juneOT: it pays off 4heads contribution but doesn’t really help the group
[2:23:39] jaycedace00: they're making bank but not funneling it into the group
[2:23:48] Clabberlang: Wouldnt the seller buy more weed if he got more money from the cleaning?
[2:23:48] dislesiksnd: they rely on you tell weed
[2:24:12] intern002: i think it is power dynamics, do they need you more or do you need them more
[2:24:14] N_eel: but it does no?
[2:24:15] luvvkoa: isnt his 15k going into the pile?
[2:24:16] israpuli: just sell it and cut it from there
[2:24:25] rosco2357: Do they not want to pay the % or something
[2:24:26] muskin6: I think 4head buys weed with his own money
[2:24:28] EleWiggle: Cooked
[2:24:29] Volt0: arent you also potentionally benefiting from turf rep
[2:24:31] iSensimillhai: 🤔
[2:24:35] amoreammo: All the money is everyone's anyways it doesn't really matter
[2:24:35] Nova__Cannon: I love 4head and can totally understand what he wants with this but I also agree at a certain point post "working" for him they become fair game - its just wheres the line
[2:24:37] juneOT: the money that’s
[2:24:38] RU8H: doesnt even make sense for a group of criminals. the lower level workers would obviously be cleaning their money through the group.
[2:24:43] juneOT: hmm
[2:24:51] N_eel: They all bought the turf together but only 4head using it to make money
[2:25:04] intern002: would you guys mind if those sellers decide to sell with another group?
[2:25:05] iZeeMo: 4head spoke about giving weed money to the group no?
[2:25:08] DavidCada: yep
[2:25:10] kpiggyyy: instead of money cleaning getting discounted why not have the weed discounted
[2:25:14] dxddy_co0l: I think the rep of turf goes up which belongs to the group no?
[2:25:15] elvueltas: I'm in the same point of you @nova__cannon
[2:25:19] ibraas11: its like income tax
[2:25:20] EleWiggle: Tbh, why 4head only dealing with Yaeger
[2:25:21] Gay_Moore: keep the money in the system
[2:25:23] burning0hammer: They're not helping you with your turf, your allowing them the opportunity to make money slangong on your turf no?
[2:25:25] Mandan0: I see it as if the weed runners are the clients for 4 Head and the client for money runs are your clients
[2:25:33] RaHuL_o7: mrbongWiggle mrbongWickedsteer mrbongWiggle
[2:25:34] ind_i_go: it's gang tax pretty common
[2:25:38] MythstaDythlexic: Heard the devs are flying in the performance parts soon  for upgrading supercharged cars in place of turbos
[2:25:39] Beafour: @Volt0 You mean if turf rep leads to something bigger? If not only the sellers benefit aka 4head. Only makes sense to keep the profit within the group
[2:25:40] huey1068: wasn't that the payment for selling on your turf
[2:25:41] rosco2357: Should just talk to them
[2:25:41] intern002: the issue is there are many other weed operations
[2:25:42] Fishnet83: @iZeeMo think that is information missing on this "side" of the conversation peepoShrug
[2:25:43] zejjk: didn't 4head said that he feels bad that he is the only one who is making money fromm weed and you guys should buy bricks too and sell them to sellers ?
[2:25:45] amoreammo: It's such a small problem it's almost not worth the argument especially with someone like 4head
[2:25:46] iZeeMo: @N_eel He's the only one taking care of it aswell
[2:25:59] Pashinko: They building a connection as well mhm
[2:26:00] rosco2357: Lil convo with them would solve it
[2:26:01] N_eel: @iZeeMo yep because everyone else lost interest
[2:26:06] iZeeMo: @Fishnet83 Yeah they forgot but it has been said to Ming
[2:26:11] WolfOfWotan: should pay tax for being on the app and being able to sell weed tbh
[2:26:14] eiyzen: but then they stop selling weed and you make no money
[2:26:21] pashu___: @n_eel and lovemore bought it and paid 10k for it mhm
[2:26:24] IcantStopEatingPizza: @zejjk yea he did told ak that
[2:26:26] Fishnet83: @iZeeMo oh ok . didnt know if that info had been said to ming specifically
[2:26:26] Volt0: @Beafour in that case the sellers themselves would be the one gaining shit and the whole rep system for the turf would be meaningless
[2:26:28] nikkomanii: that wasn't really the problem tbh 4head wanted the respect for you guys just to say we wont rob them
[2:26:28] Lurkinstoodope: @eiyzen new people ez
[2:26:29] intern002: i think it is about making them "buy in" with the crew so they feel more inclined to want to support the group
[2:26:31] rosco2357: @eiyzen Replaceable
[2:26:34] BoywithVIP: yo
[2:26:35] N_eel: @pashu___ true
[2:26:36] RU8H: its pretty much a non issue cuz they run it through you guys anyway
[2:26:38] BoywithVIP: how’s it going
[2:26:42] Spikebeepbop: Imagine pocketing money from sales at a retail job lUL
[2:26:45] donazeri: tbh it just needs to be communicated to them
[2:26:48] rosco2357: 4head
[2:26:51] muskin6: @n_eel 4head uses his own money to buy weed
[2:26:52] rosco2357: LMFAO
[2:26:53] eiyzen: @rosco2357 it takes time for 100 rep and to get people willing to stand around
[2:26:54] luvvkoa: @eiyzen then why dont they just have ming clean the money. they get the dirty money from the weed 4head has them sell
[2:26:55] albakrut: the key word is "respect"
[2:26:55] EleWiggle: 4head being 4head
[2:26:56] tarwe: Communication is the issue
[2:26:59] iZeeMo: Those are interesting conversation to have tho
[2:26:59] BoywithVIP: mrbongWiggle
[2:27:09] rosco2357: @eiyzen Doesn't take long at all to get to 100
[2:27:14] WolfOfWotan: @tarwe agreed
[2:27:15] intern002: it is like a employee in a job being asked to only visit the corporate restaurant for lunch
[2:27:21] Herccu: either clean through you or get removed from app EZ Clap
[2:27:22] syrinxeveille: i wonder most chatters would freak out if they watched both POVs since they won't have anyone to get mad on like holy fuck a wall of how 4head is wrong you'd think he's the devil
[2:27:24] Beafour: @eiyzen Its a balance, the benefit of selling the on the turf outweighs having to buy weed from them and using them to clean
[2:27:24] TapsilogPH: @albakrut  who doesn't respect who??
[2:27:27] EleWiggle: @luvvkoa cuz it's 4head 's money not for the gang
[2:27:27] Xhaandbdvsv: mmmmm
[2:27:31] MythstaDythlexic: Let's not forget the sellers were also originally Mings idea lolol
[2:27:33] eiyzen: @luvvkoa idk wasn't in the beginning deal, can't just change shit on people or force it
[2:27:34] dislesiksnd: mhm
[2:27:34] rosco2357: Legit getting everything
[2:27:34] jaycedace00: What happened to expendables
[2:27:35] akamrmenace: mhm
[2:27:39] FasweeQ: mhm
[2:27:41] intern002: @Herccu yeah so the issue would be power dynamics, does the group need those sellers more or do the sellers need the group more
[2:27:47] BoywithVIP: mhm
[2:27:47] N_eel: @syrinxeveille clap
[2:27:50] WolfOfWotan: we had to pay a monthly fee and % of what we sold
[2:27:52] Juginator: Future has a point, 4HEAD helps the weed sellers when they get robbed/chased by cops regardless if they are selling weed or doing smth else.
[2:27:53] rajadre: basically if weed profit was the whole groups money but doesn't count as 4head's 15k contribution, it makes sense
[2:27:55] 1evilshark: 3 4heads sellers are maynard kris and rj, everything is hypotetical
[2:27:56] adch03: What's this car?
[2:27:58] dxddy_co0l: But 4 head is increasing the rep of turf which benifits the group? So how is he keeping all for himself
[2:28:02] rosco2357: Fanny didn't even say no just not now
[2:28:03] adch03: D9dge stratus?
[2:28:08] intern002: what's to stop them from quitting and joining another weed operation?
[2:28:11] luvvkoa: @EleWiggle how is it 4head money if the runners are keeping it. it doesnt affect 4head money at all.
[2:28:13] albakrut: @TapsilogPH What I mean is that everyone demands respect for their business
[2:28:16] Beafour: @Volt0 No one knows where all these reps are going to lead, cant really base it on conjecture when they are selling in the present. If things change, the deal can change
[2:28:18] remmy_6: do u know much 4head is getting from weed?
[2:28:19] pratxp: making moneh
[2:28:19] iZeeMo: I think the best thing is to find a middle ground a speak about all of this with 4head
[2:28:25] intern002: so it boils back to power dynamics analysis
[2:28:39] MythstaDythlexic: Finding new escape tricks?
[2:28:39] EleWiggle: @izeemo that's the solution
[2:28:40] CROWN3R_: @herccu butt hurt much??
[2:28:44] HOTDAM: pushers like them are rare.
[2:28:48] xflame404: there are many people who are willing to sell on turf LUL
[2:28:49] Volt0: @Beafour i get that but also have to think if no one sells which in this group no one does how are they going to achieve that goal
[2:28:50] Witzz_: you thought about selling this car? or just gonna wait for it to be fixed
[2:28:54] bigpoppa352: the argument was basically 4head cutting your profit to benefit his relationship with his own employees
[2:28:54] ValuableBoring: ANY GIFTERS
[2:28:59] Gay_Moore: they can always join the company and be slave driven

[2:29:45] Nova__Cannon: ITs good RP - theres merit to both perspectives its just agreeing on a line
[2:29:46] Beafour: @Volt0 If they have everyone in the group selling, because everyone can sell, since they are master slingers. They can just bump the rep up to whats needed. Its not hard to build rep
[2:29:46] lsn_____: @4head spark up bigdog
[2:29:50] DiGatsby: !song
[2:29:51] phi1__: I think a general percentage going to the group would fix this
