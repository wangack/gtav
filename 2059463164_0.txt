[3:02:13] atlaspaginae: @ethiopianing i mean I can see it happening... when cops go to bench trail specially against Steele they just wanna get out, and usually they're certain they're in the right... so 99% of the time they just look at evidence and slightly think back and just speak before thinking. They consider being "right" first and then if it was a solid truth later, cus its a simple silly bench trial, their guard is down

[9:49:07] Deirdre_917: @DjinnJee if only Burton had pulled her aside to get her side before things escalated PEPW
[9:49:20] Deirdre_917: instead he just screamed at her Sadge
[9:49:28] ThousandEyesAnd1: except burton he looks great
[9:50:03] Deirdre_917: cadeputy wrangler NODDERS
[9:50:08] skillzmcfly: wrangler owns the server
[9:50:10] Hento: but that doesnt grief quick enough
[9:50:12] DjinnJee: @deirdre_917 He ordered her because she refused to talk to him lmao
[9:50:43] RSMatticus: if anything we blame wrangler right?
[9:51:03] Swiftym8: mbroSuffer can this wait till tomorrow
[9:51:09] Swiftym8: its already been like a month
[9:51:14] Hento: hasnt she only logged on this cop like 3 times lol
[9:51:21] imSammers: Anderson should resign honestly lol
[9:51:23] imSammers: Jesus
[9:51:24] MustardPlant: I like the conviently left out information
[9:51:26] Swiftym8: oh the wrangler dmv approach
[9:51:33] Crosis86: it was a 100 dollar fine, arresting an on duty officer in that way is really bad
[9:51:35] dnabb8436: @DjinnJee are you saying she lied?
[9:51:38] Deirdre_917: @DjinnJee I was lurking in your stream for it LUL all I remember was "NO JUST READ THE REPORT"
[9:51:40] RSMatticus: wrangler thrived at the dmv
[9:51:40] Hento: dont threaten, do it
[9:51:42] WHYDEW: OMEGALAUGHING Û†ÄÄ

[9:51:59] Nejderz: Moose you are a fresh of breath day. Always looking on both sides actions. Not simply blaming one for everything.
[9:52:12] sigfrea: @Rem753 why tho
[9:52:24] Hento: but if she wants to quit.... why......
[9:52:27] RSMatticus: @sigfrea bambi and miley called him old
[9:52:36] sigfrea: @RSMatticus LMAO
[9:52:45] TheRealBol: why is it ok for one person to threaten resignation but not others‚Ä¶
[9:52:52] Spikee439: wait....Anderson is around right now
[9:52:59] imSammers: LOL

[9:53:55] Swiftym8: shruggers lou can just fire her then
[9:54:08] Swiftym8: is it passive?
[9:54:23] Hento: if she resigned.... and didnt come back..... welp just be like oh gimmie those keys
[9:54:43] Deirdre_917: don't need that attitude to PD, especially in a shift with limited command shruggers especially if she texted she quit
[9:55:49] Roobeman: So the PD is just full of liars is what I've learned today KEKW
[9:55:59] nyxotic__: @Roobeman YEP
[9:56:04] whyydoyouask: has pred been spoken to
[9:56:21] RollinWinnies: pentawJ

[9:57:21] imSammers: @rsmatticus Jordan‚Äôs going to fix the pd tho
[9:57:23] gdfunky: Is this just Bloom cleaning up Bob's mess of a PD
[9:57:44] imSammers: Jordan‚Äôs going to sue them until the pd wakes the fuck up lol
[9:57:45] RSMatticus: @DjinnJee almost three
[9:57:51] Miditron6000: Who can understand Harold tho

[9:58:27] Spikee439: it is Bloom's fault
[9:59:25] WHYDEW: asking some of the less helpful people
[9:59:28] WHYDEW: OMEGALAUGHING
[9:59:32] Swiftym8: AINTNOWAY
[9:59:33] nyxotic__: KEKL
[10:00:04] early_retirement: The Doakes part sounds like she interpreted what he said in the worst possible way
[10:00:10] effeffess1: pentawBeef skip reading pentawBeef
[10:00:12] Miditron6000: Pred hit her with the tldr
[10:00:18] early_retirement: every cop hopes a subpeona isnt a waste of time lol
[10:00:27] WHYDEW: she wrote a whole book about this AINTNOWAY
[10:00:31] imSammers: Why the fuck is Anderson a transfer‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ and not a cadet????
[10:00:56] Crosis86: lou will pop off lol
[10:01:17] mangoinap: Its kinda absurd that someone asking for help is not getting help
[10:01:22] Miditron6000: Its not a real job Claire
[10:01:54] WHYDEW: KEKW
[10:01:55] Swiftym8: really? i didnt get that impression from the reports PepeLaugh
[10:01:57] euro_jerk: KEKW
[10:02:16] Deirdre_917: @imSammers she was in that first month of hiring where anyone with prior RP cop experience skipped cadet phase (which has been since removed since a lot of them caused so many issues)
[10:03:07] lightlessvoid: @imsammers because pd weren‚Äôt accepting cadets the being of the of server start
[10:03:12] Cobrian: IMHO she reads as someone totally over-eager but way too inexperienced to do the job she wants to do. Sure she didn't get help, but if something is too much for you, do you keep pushing it regardless? Or maybe just leave the report, notify superiors that there's something to look at, and leave it at that?
[10:03:34] SBATenney1: @lightlessvoid Well outside of one cadet, Candice got hired as one in the first month
[10:03:58] Swiftym8: OMEGALAUGHING
[10:04:07] LetsGoPolice: apple and not listening to radio Classic
[10:04:09] GreyGryphon: isn't that literally the thing Sugar complaiend cops werent responding to?
[10:04:37] Crosis86: @GreyGryphon yes lol
[10:04:38] GreyGryphon: Sugar: "No cops showed up to my call." Sugar: "People keep yelling at me to show up to calls"
[10:04:55] lightlessvoid: @sbatenney1 because wolfabell choose to be a cadet, and Candice she was the one cadet.
[10:05:13] Nejderz: seems like Gallagher told her twice
[10:05:34] rkgk_: OMEGALAUGHING

[10:06:26] Rem753: WIDEPOGGIES
[10:06:27] Swiftym8: BLUBBERS
[10:06:58] lightlessvoid: @sbatenney1 otherwise pd wasn‚Äôt hiring cadets, wolfabell choosing her cop to be a Cadet was a special case lol
[10:07:08] Miditron6000: Tow Team 6 on top
[10:07:19] Hento: what is this
[10:07:33] TheRealBol: It depends whos available but also if she knows who she should contact. Tbf sounds like shes going to senior officers which is sound logic in my opinion whether they are helpful or not
[10:07:41] Deirdre_917: so where's the investigation?
[10:07:55] Crosis86: pred will pop off lol
[10:08:17] TheRealBol: Deffo would have been Pred will be pred haha

[10:09:17] Rem753: pre-CID
[10:09:27] Deirdre_917: how could Sally do this PepeHands
[10:09:28] imSammers: @hento she hasn‚Äôt been on duty for like a month or more
[10:09:30] imSammers: lol
[10:09:32] ShawnD__: And pred would be following coc I think
[10:09:38] Hento: yea but she said it was constant a month ago
[10:09:46] PyroViking_: pred was busy with trailer park RP at the time lol
[10:09:54] Hento: only pred LOL
[10:09:55] TheRealBol: But who was on duty and available I suppose
[10:09:57] WHYDEW: "nobody is helping me" asks 3 people classic
[10:09:58] Deirdre_917: yeah lol
[10:09:58] Swiftym8: shruggers kinda seems like it
[10:10:04] Hento: she quit a month ago
[10:10:34] echosechoes_: charlesStare

[10:11:30] imSammers: and hat carl tazed wrangler on the roof lmao
[10:11:36] Deirdre_917: Charles senses your distress Gladge
[10:11:37] CohenTheBlue: CatGang
[10:11:39] Deirdre_917: or he's hungry
[10:11:45] Swiftym8: OMEGALAUGHING i can just picture wrangler running and screaming 78s in a pd
[10:11:45] imSammers: Anderson brought that lunatic up there
[10:11:47] Crosis86: tazing an on duty officer on the roof kek
[10:11:49] Nejderz: PD will be confused when they see that Wrangler has no overdue fine while Suger has the word from a judge saying otherwise
[10:11:58] Hento: I dont get it, is she turning a clearly SBS thing she helped start into an actual complaint? wtf is this
[10:12:14] imSammers: @hento yes
[10:12:15] Spikee439: today is a shit show
[10:12:29] esrou: Sounds like a good learning experience
