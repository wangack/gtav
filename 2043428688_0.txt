[0:30:06] random_viewer_55: how much did it cost?
[0:31:22] xMistressMayhem: What the city needs is people that can read the situation as cops and react accordingly. Towards the end of 3.0 it always lead to the same-Shotout or Chasing which was repetative and kind burnt out the fun when it did happen
[0:31:35] stellarnaut: Can I get your opinion on what you thought some of the bad habits were?
[0:31:52] xMistressMayhem: Talking your way out a situation can be much more rewarding IMO

[0:37:41] stellarnaut: Gotta be smart with all the money you're robbing as a crim. Flaunt it and the PD seize it
[0:37:47] Kittriss: Waow that's dangerous
[0:38:22] RonJon: or like if a lab gets caught?
[0:39:26] WhosHumble: if a player runs a business do the felony's still affect it?
[0:39:31] stellarnaut: When I see some of the mechanics the devs i think of story arcs ending like breaking bad after Gus died
[0:39:34] DallsBeep69420: Any thoughts on Dundee firing the BBMC back up?
[0:39:35] Kittriss: I would love if there was an actual prison escape like quest or whatever
