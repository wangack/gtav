[0:55:36] LusciousVenom: ngl I used to like Vader as a streamer but he‚Äôs been kinda toxic to his chat as of late
[0:55:40] HeirtoDoom: the sun going through my window was bouncing off his head i can finally watch
[0:55:40] rankdusty: i mean he just non stop robbing people lol
[0:55:42] hennessywalton9: Guys come on let him have cam back on
[0:55:42] downtownTHEEgallant: Yeah probably not a bad idea. Maybe just a smaller tone down
[0:55:42] Nzlaten: He's a criminal why are ppl crying about a criminal doing the only crime possible rn LUL
[0:55:45] cbyhre: Here comes the made you look
[0:55:47] Jac0b_H: I fucking love peanut/client whenever he‚Äôs live and I‚Äôm not at work I watch him or k
[0:55:49] reaves75stl: yeah that is a tough one because I mean that is his character
[0:55:51] reduced3: people bitch about everything and anything lol
[0:55:53] LuckyNZ: Honestly SgtApollo loved the RP from the shooting - it's the turbo robberies that are a little powerful, obviously it shouldn't be an instant removal
[0:55:53] mattyice1218: !nohate
[0:55:53] Fossabot: Hate directed at any person whether it be in game or in chat will not be tolerated, It will result in a purge, timeout or even a ban. This is your one and only warning. We are all here for entertainment and to enjoy ourselves.
[0:55:56] sleepyjoesdroolrag: Damn i thought i saw your live not when i was headed to work this morning thought it was a mistake but old binny up early on a Monday lol. Hope y'all had a great weekend
[0:56:02] Moobs_: $15+ per seems crazy
[0:56:03] goofsterrrr: he‚Äôs a criminal tho that‚Äôs what they do right üëÄ
[0:56:12] woodywiththehoodie: Matty smells
[0:56:18] LusciousVenom: yea
[0:56:23] Fossabot: Having trouble looking at 7TV emotes on stream? Download the extension at https://7tv.app for PC or Mobile
[0:56:23] woodywiththehoodie: There's my hate
[0:56:24] pfcyami: What does he do @Shotz
[0:56:24] Idealshooting: I think it would be smart for nut to tone it back a bit so we see more of client around he‚Äôs an amazing rper and yeah :)
[0:56:24] Snuggl3ss: Yeah that is tough, his character is a crazy crim that robs all the time.  Fun to watch.
[0:56:25] reduced3: @golddeath88 HOGRIDAAAA
[0:56:28] mattyice1218: not as bad as you @woodywiththehoodie
[0:56:32] hennessywalton9: I think it's  the turbo thing
[0:56:33] yeahhuhg: it‚Äôs not just client though all the boys do it
[0:56:33] sh0ot4r: report for what?
[0:56:37] SIRDELTARP: its rp you gotta deal with it cuh
[0:56:40] W1LDTV: hes crying
[0:56:42] ClearFlare: Maybe they should make other ways to get parts?
[0:56:44] Jac0b_H: @shotz what is he doing that they can report him for if u don‚Äôt mind me asking
[0:56:47] mr_canabbis: shotzPh shotzPh shotzPh shotzPh
[0:56:47] Anthoniib: @SIRDELTARP true
[0:56:49] goofsterrrr: just sell for 6$ per like k said tho
[0:56:49] woodywiththehoodie: WutFace
[0:56:49] LuckyNZ: No ramee and no K yesterday did get peanut going a little too wild imo
[0:56:51] downtownTHEEgallant: Good man Shotz. You just have to be able to see it from both sides of the coin.
[0:56:52] ironscheff: I think when you rob the same ppl back to back then they start getting pissed lol
[0:56:53] Nzlaten: Reporting him for being a criminal? Wut LUL
[0:57:02] Dorky1495: Chat... Calm down... we aint roasting peanut, he is just giving him a heads up
[0:57:03] BinkyLea: yeah I think the turbo thing was really making ppl mad
[0:57:03] Sem50: @sh0ot4r griefing
[0:57:06] Dorky1495: no need to get defensive
[0:57:09] LuckyNZ: @Nzlaten for LQRP, back to back robberies
[0:57:17] LusciousVenom: it‚Äôs because he pushed him out of jewelry with a gun and Vader was upset that the city isn‚Äôt as RP as it once was
[0:57:24] everplayz101: Yep thugg rp...it will change when civs get guns tho lol even better RP
[0:57:25] Raser28: kebunSip
[0:57:25] eaglezFly: maybe if there was more shit for crims to do there wouldnt need to be robberies 24/7
[0:57:26] Osean13: wouldn't they just make a new rule without banning since theres no rule against it?
[0:57:27] strategic__: clienteBruh
[0:57:34] Moobs_: hopefully the crying falls on deaf ears, grinders be grinding more than rp
[0:57:36] steffan_cbs: he has warrnet
[0:57:37] pfcyami: @Dorky1495  What did Nut DO?
[0:57:40] NcBully: Yeah y can report anything doesn't mean anything will happen
[0:57:45] steffan_cbs: n
[0:57:50] jeandale31: I think he tries to speed run it sometimes and should relax a bit and chill
[0:57:56] LusciousVenom: he pushed him out of jewelry run
[0:58:00] downtownTHEEgallant: @osean13 there is a rule. Basically lootboxing people.
[0:58:02] sleeplesswolf94: if he gets in trouble for robbing ppl thats gonna be wild
[0:58:06] strategic__: @pfcyami Played the game
[0:58:08] Nzlaten: @luckynz it's not intentional obviously there's just literally nothing for criminals to do other than clean the money they're robbing LUL
[0:58:12] hennessywalton9: Shotz is it just me or does crane not want crime to happen in the city
[0:58:21] pfcyami: LOL played the game love that
[0:58:27] FredCourville: people get rob and go straight back to grinding the same thing. like no fear or anything. barely rping
[0:58:28] Idealshooting: LUL
[0:58:28] kevol33t: Let be real when Civ guns get released robbing going be worse than what peanut been doing lol
[0:58:32] LuckyNZ: @Nzlaten I do agree with that somewhat yeah
[0:58:41] rubberbreaker: So what could he get it trouble for the sanitation stuff or turbos
[0:58:42] churpx: theres no crime other than grinding
[0:58:43] Dorky1495: @hennessywalton9 he is a chief justice... is he supposed to want to? he is a character too
[0:58:44] pfcyami: @strategic__  Are you telling me that he RP'ed?
[0:58:46] LuckyNZ: Yeah civ guns or g6 security escort job would solve a lot of it
[0:58:54] Jac0b_H: @lusciousvenom what was funny is Mandem/manor whatever they call themselves ran in and claimed the job without saying anything right after
[0:59:06] Idealshooting: Three more days for FF Rebirth:3
[0:59:12] FredCourville: they should just make it so you can get mats from chop car
[0:59:12] clutchthose: Good morning @shotz and chat hope you all doing well rameeLove
[0:59:15] Raser28: I like that song
[0:59:18] sleeplesswolf94: @FredCourville exactly my thoughts, if u getting robbed multiple times doing the same thing... thats on that person not the person catching u like dah heck
[0:59:20] steffan_cbs: ü§£ü§£
[0:59:20] everplayz101: @kevol33t yep exactly
[0:59:21] goofsterrrr: people wouldn‚Äôt get robbed if they sold for 6$ and didn‚Äôt open there mouth
[0:59:34] FredCourville: and not have to run the same money 4 time with diff run
[0:59:43] weyland_yutani_x: in Peanuts defence if all the jobs werent so grindy maybe he wouldnt rob people everyday some people just dont like to grind honestly ...
[0:59:47] Raser28: @sleeplesswolf94 that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying
[0:59:49] pfcyami: I think if the made the weed game pay out more then all this sanitation mats it would solve a lot of issues too
[0:59:53] almondmilkwithice: how is everyone :) especially you, you ancient fossil @shotz
[0:59:59] Dannyr921: afternoon shotz and chat
[1:00:04] azhobbit_: What has Elly done that you don't want to go out with her?
[1:00:10] TropicalToucan: @fredcourville you literally can turn ch op into mats
[1:00:12] LusciousVenom: @jac0b_h honestly yeah idk, I just know after it happened some Vader peeps came to pnuts stream and was bitching at him for doing what he did
[1:00:12] gavinjames920: organize THIS
[1:00:16] KumasCave: Son of a bits ü´µ Give me a drink ü•Éü•¥One more night üïôüåô This can‚Äôt be me üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Son of a bits ü´µ If I can‚Äôt get clean üßº  I‚Äôm gonna drink my life away üç∫üòµ‚Äçüí´
[1:00:18] Dorky1495: @azhobbit_ nothing, he just wants to do some solo runs
[1:00:23] almondmilkwithice: Organize THESE
[1:00:30] gavinjames920: wha
[1:00:34] BareMoments: how dare you organize CandianRage
[1:00:44] woodywiththehoodie: People so cringe
[1:00:46] clutchthose: Madge binny
[1:00:46] Nzlaten: If they made weed more lucrative and heists a bit more affordable then ppl won't be just grinding
[1:00:57] FredCourville: @pfcyami you need to sell, then clean and wait then run the clean money
[1:00:57] Dorky1495: @Nzlaten Kappa
[1:01:09] cbyhre: "enjoying"
[1:01:11] clutchthose: NODDERS
[1:01:12] pfcyami: Thats what im saying
[1:01:13] natur666: some ppl cringe af
[1:01:14] totti7r: binny  not u
[1:01:15] LusciousVenom: I get both sides, I think there needs to be more jobs for crims and there needs to be protection for civs, I also think there needs to be a tad more interaction before robbing people
[1:01:16] Nzlaten: @dorky1495 hey bro you got me rameeHype
[1:01:17] pfcyami: IF WEED was more lucrative
[1:01:18] darkchef64: Medhi does the same thing. I‚Äôm used to it. like it
[1:01:18] hennessywalton9: Even if civilians get guns they are still going against cg so it will hardly help them
[1:01:20] downtownTHEEgallant: fifiFlower you da man

[1:01:27] Roberg: LUL
[1:01:28] Sem50: @goofsterrrr that's not how to change the economy tho. increase supply (more ways to find mats) or decrease demand( lower the amount of mats to craft things)
[1:01:29] defy07: I think the city needs another way to get materials, or just a way to isolate getting circuit boards since they are so high demand in the city. Possibly a way to just purchase the GPU's rather than craft.
[1:01:31] pfcyami: If weed payed out more and didnt have so many steps to it

[1:16:14] typarks_: do you think magdump season is coming
[1:16:16] KumasCave: it was fun
[1:16:18] Dannyr921: the kick stream seemed a bit more refreshing
[1:16:25] 500oldtimer: !meta
[1:16:25] Fossabot: Please DO NOT tell Shotz what is going on in other streams/situations. That is METAGAMING which is against the rules.
[1:16:30] B1RDFLUU: yea its crazy
[1:16:45] ltb_illusion: lesson learned don‚Äôt gamble

[1:16:54] getrektlosernerd: @typarks_ cant say magdump lol
[1:16:55] Rxssss: in a good way ?
[1:17:16] HD_xx: The fact twitch doesnt give streamers full revenue on subs is mind boggling tbh
[1:17:17] X3N0VERSE1: is kick still 95/5 split?
[1:17:25] Nzlaten: 90% of the cars are loud ngl
[1:17:45] typarks_: @getrektlosernerd well hell week then lol
[1:17:47] Moobs_: Getting 9 ads every 10-15min on twitch when checking out new streams is the worst
[1:17:53] dicehammertv: TriceraShotz would be a great channel name
[1:17:59] xtylaw: And for the lil guys there is no threshold to hit so if you have 1 sub you get paid you have 1000 you get paid
[1:17:59] ZMISKE_: how the hell does kick make money lol
[1:18:02] Dannyr921: front page over there, already above 100 subs on there. lost the gamba was a good stream

[1:18:27] 13clicks: freedom
[1:18:28] xtylaw: Its good only thing that sucks is the delay from when I type to when in chat

[1:19:29] nickmerc4head: It quite literally is ran better and smoother. It's literally a point that steak points out
[1:19:29] gavinjames920: shotzRain GYAT
[1:19:39] Dannyr921: how do kick make money if they have no ads and don‚Äôt take a cut from subs
[1:19:42] HD_xx: Twitch has brain washed people thinking that sub money and ads is the only way to pay the bills lol
[1:19:43] forfiet: delayed cus to many or delayed just cus it‚Äôs delayed
[1:19:50] xtorgex: @shotz the only problem I have with kick is that I don‚Äôt have an app on my tv to watch it

[2:51:08] sleeplesswolf94: yea but how? if u dont see or hear there voice how can they just assume its that person?
[2:51:15] smokindave: Peanut would never rob civs and take transmissions and turbos
[2:51:19] Axro_: @threenpink yeah but peanut said none of that matters. the house isn‚Äôt under his name.
[2:51:22] scottqpr12: shotz is right
[2:51:24] ST4NKiii: peanut robbing ppl like he is doing some daily challenges or some shit LUL

[2:51:40] mackancurtaincheeks: But Los Santos is a city of 10 million üßê
[2:51:50] Axro_: @threenpink they can only raid his apartment. but knowing these new laws and stuff I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll find away way to link the CG house.
[2:51:55] themac250: @ST4NKiii hahahahhahahaahaa
[2:51:56] Moobs_: he was masked up
[2:52:06] b_goodhue: He doing it 8 hours a day
[2:52:09] scrappythe1st: it is called an MO
[2:52:09] LadyLynxx: Doesn't matter moobs
[2:52:09] mmajeter2: @axro_ cops are investigating spare keys. it will become an issue eventually
[2:52:13] themac250: @Axro_ 100% its coming
[2:52:16] Luurrrrn: So how long is a year in prison?  If one month is a minute
[2:52:17] UrClassicDerp: Besides this K and Ramee do the exact same thing so what‚Äôs the difference
[2:52:20] alz_7: I mean civs do the same thing everyday LUL
[2:52:21] DeeKoiii: Vinny could go and do those same hits that pnut is hitting, and Vinny will be assumed to be pnut, that's what Vinny is saying lol
[2:52:30] LadyLynxx: Not hard to put the puzzle together
[2:52:31] Hudson_Pain: barely concealing ID, superman glasses isn't enough to prevent it
[2:52:33] faithy_o: @Luurrrrn a day

[2:52:45] gavinjames920: chat it ain‚Äôt that deep
[2:52:49] mackancurtaincheeks: Free Penut ‚úä
[2:52:50] Moobs_: I get that, but what‚Äôs the point of a mask in RP then?
[2:52:51] DeeKoiii: @urclassicderp they efficiently plan, peanut just full sends ü§£
[2:53:12] duckhunter_88: chop
[2:53:24] Ichigolo: they need to fix crim stuff so u can do it in the day too
[2:53:26] sleeplesswolf94: i see what u r saying now i didnt know peanut was that dumb to be going up to ppl not masked up asking to test drive cars. thats a whole different story then
[2:53:27] scrappythe1st: A modus operandi (often shortened to M.O. or MO) is someone's habits of working, particularly in the context of business or criminal investigations
[2:53:29] Axro_: @threenpink at this moment though they‚Äôd be breaching K‚Äôs rights to raid the house. they‚Äôre use to that though.. binks1Despair
[2:53:31] UrClassicDerp: @deekoiii when ramee was with the peanut the other day, they did the same exact thing
[2:53:37] LadyLynxx: uhsF
[2:53:45] Gr1zzz: K is going to have to make him walk home again
[2:53:52] boomershow824: K said it best. There's things K and X can get away with on the server that other people can't purely bc of who they are.
[2:53:55] b_goodhue: He wears the same outfits same everything
[2:54:02] L33royJon3s71: nuts outta cntrl reflects on the group

[2:54:24] QTalexandra: @boomershow824 what?
[2:54:25] gavinjames920: he def wouldn‚Äôt say that
[2:54:25] Axro_: in a way
[2:54:27] mackancurtaincheeks: What?
[2:54:29] UrClassicDerp: Saying he does that 8-10 hours every day is a big overstatement when the boys are around he does shit with them
[2:54:31] ShrimpOnTheBarbii: he did
[2:54:32] ThreeNPink: @boomershow824 I dont rememeber him saying that
[2:54:32] 06porkchop06: He did shotz
[2:54:32] NiteMDE: hit em with the sh sh
[2:54:34] d3ltaf0x: He did say it but is out of context
[2:54:36] hellenkeller_sidepiece: he was talking about bans
[2:54:37] vipersting13: @Shotz he said that is a way
[2:54:38] highspeedpi: No face no case lol
[2:54:41] kobezzy: he did the other day
[2:54:43] shessocold: what is not what he said

[2:54:45] Beast_SyCo: yeah he actually did say it
[2:54:45] ZMISKE_: he said he had leeway not that he can get away with heavy shit
[2:54:47] themac250: said it about robbing a gun right outside pd steps when penut did it
[2:54:47] sirdarkmoon: he did
[2:54:50] boomershow824: For the gun cases
[2:54:54] GrazyGraz: he did tbh but it wasnt anything to do with stealing turbos
[2:54:54] thaas: Not pertaining to anything like this
[2:54:57] d3ltaf0x: Was talking about bans no this mather
[2:54:59] BillsMafiaSTF: K said that for entirely different reasons it dont apply to this Peanut situation
[2:54:59] ZeroSandZ: @shotz here was talking about a different thing
[2:54:59] shessocold: he was talking about gray areas
[2:55:01] millzystar: I love ya shotz
[2:55:06] mackancurtaincheeks: If he said that, it's a clip. So get it, bucko.
[2:55:06] deerlakeboy: your still breathing thank goodness
[2:55:06] Axro_: he said he wouldn‚Äôt hold the same responsibilities because of how long he‚Äôs beeen around etc. it‚Äôs how life works. but I didn‚Äôt take it the way the chatter put it.
[2:55:06] alz_7: I think he meant bans
[2:55:06] weyland_yutani_x: thats weird i dont think K would say that
[2:55:07] IAmBr3tt: more about bans
[2:55:13] thaas: he meant like shit that would get bahama'd that are like grey areas
[2:55:14] Damastalex: was talking about bans
[2:55:18] Damastalex: yea
[2:55:20] sirdarkmoon: no he said he‚Äôll be able to get away from something cuz of who he is compared to someone that isn‚Äôt as big
[2:55:23] 06porkchop06: He was talking more about bans and having alittle more leeway
[2:55:28] tristan910: tristan910 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 31 months! 
[2:55:30] RazorBruh: @Shotz he didnt say they can get away with stuff, he said there is a little more leaniency
[2:55:38] mackancurtaincheeks: I think he talked about the concept of Hell weak

[2:55:55] Jeremy9000CS2: arsehole
[2:55:59] nhgrown603: should we be worried about chip? lol
[2:56:08] lurkyone: WutFace LUL
[2:56:09] LadyLynxx: Lol chen
[2:56:11] sleeplesswolf94: all i can say is, if peanut is doing this stuff masked up everyday and using different voice. its bullshit to be ID.  if hes doing it not masked up, its valid to be ID.
[2:56:25] ShrimpOnTheBarbii: he needs the "oh yeah nah yeah nah yeahhh"
[2:56:26] Gr1zzz: You also have to be able to read the room and the temperature of the server to know what you can get away with. If you just spam run stuff it won't last
[2:56:33] thaas: Yea this has nothing to do with what peanut is doing
[2:56:51] rubberbreaker: That lynol fella however you spell his name will probably get ocean dumped though if he keeps snitching about everyone at Mosely's trying to take a turbo
[2:56:51] thaas: He doesnt mean spamming a crime
[2:56:52] highspeedpi: Gameplay
[2:57:02] mackancurtaincheeks: Penut will not get b anned, chat KEKW
[2:57:03] sirdarkmoon: ohhh I remember ramee wanted to rob people as soon as they finish a job for laundry mat but apparently that would be really frowned upon
[2:57:06] Zanethereaper: Its more in character trouble.
[2:57:16] woodywiththehoodie: People like k and x can push boundaries more then others lol has nothing to do what shotz was saying
[2:57:17] QUiiCKSHO7: @Shotz this was talking about the rule about not being able to set up and rob someone at a job once it is started and Ramee and X were talking about ways to get around it
[2:57:23] alz_7: the character yeah
[2:57:35] Axro_: yeah he‚Äôs more or less speaking on vaca‚Äôs, & things that aren‚Äôt against the rules but could be. that‚Äôs why I said I didn‚Äôt take it the way the chatter explained it.
[2:57:38] hennessywalton9: Yeah ramee did it 1 time and everyone found out
[2:57:40] sirdarkmoon: then he said that no that‚Äôs some scumy shit and then he went on saying that
[2:57:47] UrClassicDerp: I get where you are coming from but when K and Ramee are around he is usually with them, he doesn‚Äôt do that shit non stop
[2:57:57] lurkyone: foxyannikaCarry
[2:58:11] BrickNader: he's making his name too hot around the city
[2:58:12] Axro_: clienteDance
[2:58:38] 1cmwebstar: k has had this talk with pnut
[2:58:41] Damastalex: yea I think that‚Äôs the case
[2:58:43] hillaryclinton_xo: i thnk he's going for it
[2:58:51] Gr1zzz: Sure, but then you can't be upset when you end up a week or two in jail
[2:58:52] Damastalex: K has had this talk with peanut too
[2:58:54] Damastalex: yea
[2:58:59] ninjagirl8816: Hai shotzSl
[2:59:03] highspeedpi: Peanut doesn't need to prove anything but he sometimes acts like he is
[2:59:03] theancientones1: It's good money if he can figure out a way to get away with it
[2:59:05] dpbjiio3420: do rp points go away? or something better not said?
[2:59:19] Damastalex: @dpbjiio3420 not for here

[3:01:49] boomershow824: Not many people know how to do business RP the way u do
[3:01:49] ItsAHazardLife: chaos with the boys? or do you mean lose all the money at night with the boys Shotz?
[3:02:00] novawingz: nothing wrong with doing sani on top of the robbing to get more mats but no one wants to lol

[4:46:04] xJOKURv: for streamers like Nickmercs where all subs go to twitch
[4:46:08] ADoggNJ: No way it costs them $250+ a month to have someone streaming
[4:46:14] PunchCXD: yeah, plus it makes me wonder how tiwtch managed to fund this prior to the Amazon buyout
[4:46:17] stronczek87: Can I name drop a twitch streamer ?
[4:46:21] alz_7: and dumping more and more Ads
[4:46:34] GDAX: there are 100s of thousands of 100 < less streamers

[4:46:47] sleeplesswolf94: idk Mr K went over the numbers the other day and its pretty damn expensive the more viewers they have if they are watching ins 1080p which the majority tends to watch in that setting
[4:46:52] ExessiveGK: when Amazon baught Twitch the first thing they did was move the format over to Amazon servers where they already make their own pirces for their own paid servers
[4:46:59] ObsidianDragon: @shotz  its not enough.  There is more small streamer then big
[4:46:59] ryanmaloney010: I wouldn‚Äôt mind them adds are crazy every 5 minutes

[4:48:33] stakedusan: Kick doesn't need to take money from streamers due to funds they have with stake
[4:48:40] stronczek87: I think this affects more Minecraft streamers than anything else . Like people streaming hermitcraft
