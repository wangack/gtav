[0:52:43] mcfaceex: @Gachiguru that doesn't matter though, the case is probably gonna be thrown out because of the mess up, and since its a stolen gun the daps make sense
[0:52:43] ecstasy_1000: @tr0kgaming oooof not acceptable
[0:52:44] tellos0: but he didn't reference it
[0:52:48] stekie: It shouldn't be 2 dap points either way
[0:52:49] CrystalDimension: @Brisk_Avocado So it was said that way before but it actually turns out it might not be a thing. After 10th one there's a review by all the captains and firing in unlikely
[0:52:49] nickdrawsstuff: Hardass Captains are fine, but suspension is just shit roleplay --- there are other ways to reprimand someone --- put them on dispatch for a day, remove their gun priviliedges, make them clean the bathrooms, etc.
[0:52:53] AnusReaktorMan: It's 2 daps ? OMEGALUL
[0:52:54] MadderHatter: that doesnt deserve a dap just tell him to correct it
[0:52:57] MexiBrent: @Gachiguru which he was denied because  there was no lawyers, and then one came around but it was to late for a bench trail, so it has to be an appeal now

[0:54:28] unanimous_night: the captains were saying DAPs are meant for when people can't learn after being explain what they did wrong. The captains should give a couple days for the officers to try to understand what the captains are trying to "correct" and only then see if a DAP applies, because people can't really change how they understand regulations in the blink of an eye

[6:06:04] lilbuddy__: @EsfandTV
[6:06:06] Largely_Sauce: The worst part is resisting while tazed lol
[6:06:12] C0ndu1t: imo cops should have a counter "skill check" the person who is more accurate wins.

[7:50:34] Myshkinas: FirstTimeChatter
[7:50:35] toskatz: if you hit the sidewalk bumb it gives you speed
[7:50:36] Gachiguru: youd bounce up and down on the curb and it tweaked your suspension to make it go faster
[7:50:37] iozrem: FirstTimeChatte
[7:50:37] judge_hat: maybe for inactivity
[7:50:38] MacVane: it was the bumps that boosted
[7:50:39] ULTRAKona_: is that like the bikes jumping to go faster
[7:50:41] Happy_Axolotl: if the back of the car hits the ground
[7:50:43] xnightshift2658: requesting cops cornwoood
[7:50:44] SlimTDC: Yes, thats hard coded into the game. When you compress the vehicle to the ground it gains a minor speed boost
[7:50:46] MacVane: so you kinda grinded the curb back and forth for speed
[7:50:47] DailyRPG: yo
[7:50:47] EternalCoconut: Differences in height would work the suspension so that it would give you extra speed, not just curbs, but most obviously there
[7:50:51] daedayz: ur car was just faster on the curb i think. watched summit do a lot when he raced
[7:50:51] MacVane: but it was hard to control if ur not good
[7:50:53] EPiQ: uneven terrain "breaks friction" in GTA5
[7:50:55] ToxiccLadd: so base GTA has a handling flag that increases the revs of a car when you hit bumps which increases speed
[7:50:56] kain_loc: The springs compressing used to give a slight acceleration boost. So you could go vroom vroom.
[7:50:56] Mastodonian: Stop making 911 calls people we wanna go scuba diving MadgeRightNow
[7:50:58] iwannanuhh: yeah basically when your car would hit a curb the slight air time would speed your car up or something like that
[7:51:00] keyphh: just requested cops
[7:51:00] CrystalDimension: @EsfandTV I think driving off the curbs was the same as falling/ going downhill, so there was acceleration YEP

[11:18:47] RetPaladinBot: After getting these numbers we find find the average flaccid penis size ( 3.61 ) and divide the average erect penis size (5.16) and do the following: 5.16/3.61 to get the soft to erect ratio. 5.16/3.61=1.42 inches erect for every inch soft. So we take esfands soft/slight chub size of 5.71 and multiply it by 1.42 to find his erect size. 5.71*1.42= 8.1
