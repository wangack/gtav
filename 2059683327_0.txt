[0:53:31] kgenera: A small trailer for weed op would be cool
[0:53:44] Lozza_95: nodd
[0:53:54] BVNISH: maybe if you sold it to the Ballas as a friend thing
[0:53:54] SlyDolphin: but maybe in the very future when houses are limited/bought, the prices will skyrocket
[0:53:59] rubyn0odle: smal trailer close to the turf :D like a weed house
[0:54:01] Nemo7: Or if the Ballas ask to buy it
