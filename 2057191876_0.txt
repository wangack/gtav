[2:01:56] QuesoCommander: do they count as viewers? probably just chat bots
[2:02:44] nobodybodon: oops
[2:02:48] davelecook: nakkiDerp
[2:03:00] Grimz92: Grimz92 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months, currently on a 2 month streak! 
[2:03:01] JadedHopeful: what the..
[2:03:10] mgFray: be really careful copying any part of the bot message.. we've seen twitch blow away valid accounts for partial copies of the spam..
[2:03:19] nobodybodon: @JadedHopeful You said the forbidden word KEKW
[2:03:24] JadedHopeful: lmao noted
[2:03:37] JoeayIV: streamer
[2:03:38] davelecook: what I did ?
[2:03:39] JoeayIV: i want you to know
[2:03:41] effeffess1: @nobodybodon DoritosChip
[2:03:44] JadedHopeful: to paraphrase, the dude isn't even hiding what it is
[2:03:44] JoeayIV: i spilled so much coffee
[2:03:47] JoeayIV: so much
[2:03:53] JadedHopeful: and that's obnoxious
[2:03:56] Grimz92: I know when I joined in you had around 250 viewers
[2:04:00] JoeayIV: mid sip dawg
[2:04:03] JoeayIV: just my lap
[2:04:06] JoeayIV: it wasn't too hot
[2:04:36] JoeayIV: tho now my pants are gonna smell like maple coffee no matter how much i wash them
[2:04:57] davelecook: Maple ?
[2:05:45] Makaveli079: Tato put the pants a few hours in hot water and baking soda
[2:05:47] davelecook: didn‚Äôt know g6 get up here ??
[2:07:15] QuesoCommander: have you decided how the racing will work?
[2:07:51] JadedHopeful: @joeayiv that's not a bad smell at least!
[2:09:06] jimothy64: I find it amusing that tessas commute, instead of stopping for like eggs or whatever on the way home, often is "pick up a few walls on your way home" lol
[2:09:17] brikbeans: https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIG2.jz9hyLzgV9StfDG7i39Y?pid=ImgGn
[2:09:26] brikbeans: osnic hors ehead pole <3
[2:09:29] brikbeans: sonic*
[2:11:01] QuesoCommander: what about the actual race part?
[2:11:09] blackpilIed: when the sheriffs office opens do you plan on being a trooper?
[2:11:24] JadedHopeful: I forgot how tall my character was in the game I'm playing and I just ran into a hanging brazier and made myself jump at the sound it made
[2:11:26] retrowolf0498: !cop
[2:11:27] StreamElements: Tessa has retired from the Rangers and is no longer a cop.
[2:11:50] brikbeans: jousting could be a 3 sided dye and best 3/5 or something.
[2:11:58] brikbeans: like gambling receipts lol

[2:13:05] brikbeans: EZ
[2:13:25] QuesoCommander: unconventional, but if you can't get PD obstacles then running across the center to the other side could work
[2:13:46] JoeayIV: i mean
[2:13:53] brikbeans: gallop X y Z pick one thye have to do  lol
[2:13:57] JoeayIV: either you ban certain runs
[2:14:03] jimothy64: Maybe they could run on the grass inner circle, then cars can follow on the outside dirt path for spectating, anticheat, medical access etc.
[2:14:04] JoeayIV: force everyone on the same run
[2:14:06] JoeayIV: or roll for runs
[2:14:19] JoeayIV: cuz people are silly
[2:14:20] brikbeans: obstacles might be funny to roll like DND
[2:14:40] brikbeans: thats incredible
[2:14:44] molotov_michelle: As long as they dont do the griddy run exploit
[2:14:49] JoeayIV: could do pools of runs
[2:14:52] JoeayIV: like tiers
[2:14:52] nightscout: Obstacles would be good
[2:14:57] blackpilIed: maybe their horse should get a better run animation Kappa
[2:14:59] QuesoCommander: need either more randomness in the track or some rubber banding like Mario Kart
[2:15:01] nightscout: Have the pd bring some barricades
[2:15:12] Makaveli079: you know fall guys.. 3 doors and 2 fake doors that would be cool
[2:15:15] molotov_michelle: That's a good idea
[2:15:29] jimothy64: Obstacles would also be easier on the grass ring, it being narrower
[2:15:42] brikbeans: label them all with the word charity for kids lol <3
[2:15:53] QuesoCommander: could make the center of the track the obstacle portion
[2:16:00] nightscout: Locked cars
[2:16:01] ThatSoKyuRo: you could set up a domo race with cars on this track as well like race with being able to hit cars tell ur car stops working
[2:16:02] blackpilIed: maybe staff that stands by each obstacle that watches them?
[2:16:16] nightscout: @ThatSoKyuRo Thats a good idea!
[2:17:21] QuesoCommander: can't remember, was tackling allowed or not?
[2:17:24] ThatSoKyuRo: then when that happens do a count down
[2:17:24] nightscout: Introduce a car run by the event operators
[2:17:30] jimothy64: Need a crossover in the track for demo races
[2:17:35] footmunched: Maybe have a timer hen there are 3 cars left
[2:17:40] nightscout: nightscout subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:17:42] sage40k: i entered one on a scooter =3
[2:17:49] JoeayIV: i think its good for one reason
[2:17:53] QuesoCommander: it would make things interesting with people teaming up with plans
[2:17:53] JoeayIV: tackling sucks
[2:17:53] nightscout: I think tackling would inject some chaos
[2:17:56] Jen848: nakkiHappyClap nakkiHappyClap
[2:17:59] QuesoCommander: but some people might get upset
[2:17:59] JoeayIV: cuz like
[2:17:59] brikbeans: cross bred horses have 1 tackle a race.... ? err idk
[2:18:03] blackpilIed: i think it would be funny
[2:18:03] JoeayIV: it slows you and the other down
[2:18:08] JoeayIV: but there is more than two people
[2:18:11] JoeayIV: so you never want to
[2:18:16] Thisisme710: nakkiHALD
[2:18:20] JoeayIV: but telling people "tackling is allowed"
[2:18:31] brikbeans: honor system is trash ur so wise lol
[2:18:31] Makaveli079: it would be chaos
[2:18:33] nightscout: Well, figured I'd throw some support your way, I normally just watch you on Youtube
[2:18:49] footmunched: are the races poitnr-to-point or laps?
[2:18:56] charlestic: Honour system falls apart as soon as betting starts
[2:19:00] sage40k: if only we had land mines
[2:19:08] brikbeans: people gonna wiff their tackle and lie for 100k everytime
[2:19:17] JoeayIV: this reminds me of that one time Buddha was in the bario
[2:19:17] nightscout: I came in a bit late into it, are we just spitballing ideas for events on this track?
[2:19:28] DrWickk: hey Nikkida, hope ur well dear, just a quick question, do u know much about eels ?
[2:19:40] ingridktravels: I think something if not tackling needs to be added, otherwise there is no skill based challenge
[2:20:02] JoeayIV: yes
[2:20:04] nightscout: Yes
[2:20:09] QuesoCommander: probably ye
[2:20:10] IIIIHELLIIII: mehdiNodders
[2:20:15] JoeayIV: so like
[2:20:15] ingridktravels: Absolutely
[2:20:18] JoeayIV: as much variance you can add
[2:20:20] JoeayIV: you should
[2:20:24] footmunched: people will do it anyway
[2:20:42] JoeayIV: okay so like
[2:20:47] JoeayIV: i have an idea
[2:20:47] nightscout: I still like the idea of locked cars on the track
[2:20:55] nightscout: Can't easily steal those
[2:21:00] JoeayIV: some runs are pretty close to each other in speed right?
[2:21:00] QuesoCommander: ooh yeah car obstacles is pretty good
[2:21:18] QuesoCommander: harder to get now unless lockpicks are cheap
[2:21:27] brikbeans: maybe audience members and horse owners can volunteer
[2:21:31] JoeayIV: you could do tiered racing where people roll on similar speeds of runs
[2:21:34] nightscout: Work with tow in rp
[2:21:39] ingridktravels: Even some pounder trucks or g6 trucks
[2:21:43] nightscout: To see if they'd let you "use" some
[2:21:56] brikbeans: get cars marked for impound and give htem a detour lmao
[2:22:20] nightscout: Tow trucks
[2:22:31] nightscout: EMS too
[2:22:32] brikbeans: oh i was like huh
[2:22:34] jimothy64: Yeah I bet Red would be down to coordinate things. Some tow trucks with their beds extended would probably cover most of the width
[2:22:44] nightscout: They'd already be out there for any race related injuries
[2:23:00] brikbeans: the horse cleric ofc
[2:23:03] nightscout: And I'm sure they'd be fine with leaving one or two in the race
[2:23:19] jimothy64: Bottlenecks
[2:23:29] brikbeans: choke plus jumping= chaos
[2:23:31] brikbeans: <3
[2:23:40] thephil2020: I was just about to say choke points
[2:23:41] QuesoCommander: only issue is that is if someone gets out in front, they might just win
[2:23:42] Makaveli079: yeah that‚Äôs cool
[2:23:42] blackpilIed: are you gonna have bets/gambling?

[2:23:53] JoeayIV: okay
[2:23:54] footmunched: the things that 'spread out' car racing are mechanical skill and locals, neither of which really apply to running
[2:23:55] JoeayIV: hear me out
[2:23:57] nightscout: Yeah
[2:23:58] QuesoCommander: unless there's a way to slow down someone out in the lead
[2:24:11] JoeayIV: stick James Randell out on the track with a knife @Nakkida
[2:24:14] brikbeans: it allows for foot persuit race traing like drivers.... omg this is kinda big
[2:24:27] JoeayIV: ????
[2:24:29] nightscout: Put him out there with a moped
[2:24:31] nightscout: And let him kick
[2:24:32] JoeayIV: whats wrong with that?
[2:24:36] nobodybodon: James Randal is just a silly little guy
[2:24:41] JoeayIV: i didn't say tell him to stab people
[2:24:41] nobodybodon: he would only defend himself
[2:24:51] nightscout: Bike race
[2:24:55] nightscout: Thats always an easy idea
[2:25:00] brikbeans: moped type beat
[2:25:13] blackpilIed: JOUSTING YESSSS
[2:25:19] wtfrank_: You can get scooters from senior buns deliveries, if it's allowed
[2:25:19] Blunderbusses: could get a bunch of bikes from paleto
[2:25:27] brikbeans: like that n64 game road rash er whatever
[2:25:29] nightscout: That is true @wtfrank_
[2:25:37] ReiSundae: Bike races, could look like they're galloping with the trick people do with bikes
[2:25:41] charlestic: Can you hold the rbeesJericho on a bycycle?
[2:25:55] FreshayAU: KonCha TPFufun
[2:26:26] nightscout: I'd say partner with tow or senior buns, ones an obstacle course and the other for their mopeds
[2:26:49] nightscout: Because you can keep their scooters out until you drive it back, and if they're okay with it your still above board
[2:27:08] blackpilIed: do you ever hear some of the crazy things locals say
[2:27:22] brikbeans: secret modped rental would go huuuge
[2:27:54] Grimz92: nakkiLoveBlue nakkiLoveBlue
[2:28:18] blackpilIed: im sure you could ask someone with a lockpick to get you a few mopeds
[2:28:50] brikbeans: so wise
[2:28:51] jimothy64: Always some "community" bicycles in paleto but then you've got to ferry enough down without any despawns.. not happening
[2:29:05] blackpilIed: ahhhh okay yeah that‚Äôs understandable
[2:29:47] JoeayIV: try the give version
[2:29:48] brikbeans: full sustainability horse larping
[2:30:03] JoeayIV: oh neat
[2:30:36] footmunched: I mean, all the contestants have access to their tow truck, right?
[2:30:56] TheGuiltyPleasure: can you place it on the bike?

[2:36:23] jimothy64: Maybe the dirt roads with the mines? I don't think there's lions there
[2:36:51] QuesoCommander: might be weird in "horse" race but some task or challenge in the middle could make it more fair

[2:43:37] ReiSundae: What about the griddy with the horse out?
[2:43:40] nightscout: Thats a fair point
[2:44:00] ReiSundae: Awww
[2:44:02] charlestic: I wonder does the position of the horse change per type of bike?
[2:44:19] JoeayIV: im so sad they removed the griddy low
[2:44:47] nightscout: With or without tackling?
[2:44:57] JoeayIV: WELL
[2:45:00] QuesoCommander: yeah I saw that too
[2:45:01] JoeayIV: TIME TO LEARN
[2:45:18] jimothy64: In before Tessa's first event somehow crashes the server in a new and spectacular way
[2:45:34] nightscout: @jimothy64 Thats how you know its a good event

[5:36:47] JoeayIV: Tiny DinkDonk
[5:36:59] JadedHopeful: @stephber forever 25
[5:37:00] DJayEnzyme: @nobodybodon what age do I become "old". if 30 is really old. I'm now concerned
[5:37:11] retrowolf0498: Maybe go find a spot to grow the seeds you have?
[5:37:17] stephber: you just become 29 multiple times
[5:37:49] JadedHopeful: it's OK Nakkida, you don't have to call me old. My body did that.. because the moment I hit 30 my body decided it was over this shiz
[5:37:50] QuesoCommander: tell the group you sold the extra materials they left for some nice side panels and see how it goes
[5:38:07] macman385: summits been 27 for like 8 years now so...
[5:38:19] evergreentyr: I'm aging like a fine wine... that's turned to vinegar over the past few years...
[5:38:34] retrowolf0498: I started getting those random pains at 23
[5:38:38] stephber: i've gotten used to my knee going "click"
[5:38:39] nobodybodon: @DJayEnzyme 20 nodd
[5:38:42] QuesoCommander: that's not normal DESKCHAN
[5:38:48] JoeayIV: bruh im afraid of getting older, every time i see a student doctor before my actual doctor comes in they have this look of mild concern
[5:38:50] alphawolfgrave: I still have the GTA sub token
[5:38:55] DJayEnzyme: @nobodybodon fuck im old then
[5:39:03] alphawolfgrave: Just don't know how to use it
[5:39:11] nobodybodon: gotta do more squats
[5:39:13] nobodybodon: or less squats
[5:39:15] nobodybodon: who knows
[5:39:18] brikbeans: 29 and just had an extended hammer toe surgery and before that i was like never aging but a year of not walking aged me 10
[5:39:20] JadedHopeful: gurl my bones creak when I sit up in bed. Or toss and turn. It's crazy. when I wake up my body becomes a percussion set
[5:39:21] nobodybodon: barrel
[5:39:22] retrowolf0498: @alphawolfgrave gift subs. You'll have an option to use it
[5:39:25] dancingisraeIi: mine went away in my ankle after taking progesterone
[5:39:28] stephber: was on the rowing machine and i was clicking away yesterday
[5:39:32] jimothy64: I don't feel like my knees have ever not clicked
[5:39:45] JadedHopeful: 'drumroll please? sure lemme just.. turn over'
[5:39:46] stephber: maybe i should just watch more GTARP instead of exercising....
[5:40:25] annonym69: It gets bad when you turn 40 üòà
[5:40:49] brikbeans: @stephber based. try a foam roller or lacrosse ball lol could help im a pt and a pt... lol
[5:40:59] JadedHopeful: I also like.. struggle to breathe when I wake up, because Covid decided I didn't need to breath like.. 8-9 months ago
[5:41:17] JadedHopeful: breathe*
[5:41:41] JadedHopeful: ever since then it's like waking up with small bladed cobwebs in my lungs
[5:42:03] JadedHopeful: BARREL
[5:42:20] retrowolf0498: @JadedHopeful Yikes. Certain strains of Covid are rough. I was lucky and got the sinus infection style variant.
[5:42:40] stephber: @brikbeans NODDERS need to stretch more before doing that stuff - have tight hamstrings which doesn't help
[5:43:12] JadedHopeful: @retrowolf0498 it SUUUCKS
[5:43:30] JadedHopeful: I also blame that on my being in my thirties so
[5:43:38] retrowolf0498: @JadedHopeful One of my friends I know IRL got it twice in a year. I know
[5:44:03] DJayEnzyme: @retrowolf0498 i got it 3 times in the space of 10 months
[5:44:10] Brumorin: a tv on that lip would actually be lit
[5:44:16] Brumorin: the wall lip
[5:44:31] alphawolfgrave: 2 bed for sleep over to prank
[5:44:35] retrowolf0498: @DJayEnzyme you have earned the title of the unluckiest person I know currently
[5:44:36] JoeayIV: ah yes, the classic go to bed from fallout 4
[5:44:44] CatGotYourKeyboard: My husband and I still haven't had it. Everyone else in our families have had it more than once.
[5:44:50] alphawolfgrave: Malachi
[5:45:29] JadedHopeful: Also, unrelated to my body deciding its done with stuff. I got called pregnant my a customer last week. I'm very much not and physically can't get pregnant but it DID make my day. Especially as I know the lil ol lady didn't mean anything malicious by it. I didn't have the heart to correct her in front of an entire queue of folks so I just.. rolled with it when she asked how my pregnancy was coming along.
[5:45:45] DJayEnzyme: @retrowolf0498 Yeah my company allowed people to come back to work if they felt "well enough" which was the most stupid decision as they are a sterile manufacturing site
[5:46:09] JadedHopeful: 'yeah it's going alright! some days are rough but I'm getting there'
[5:46:10] stephber: huuuuuuge TV
[5:46:32] retrowolf0498: @DJayEnzyme Yea. I work in a USDA plant and it's the same policy. No wonder it spread throughout the plant in 2 weeks...
[5:47:04] jimothy64: That screen at that distance, she can *try*
[5:48:12] jimothy64: Drawers under the overhang
[5:48:28] stephber: yes, a built-in

[5:49:18] JadedHopeful: PrideWingL PrideSaba PrideWingR
