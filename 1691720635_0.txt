[1:04:51] omaha_haha: nice viper
[1:04:54] papajohn_67: sell it
[1:05:05] ZaTaco: It's free but there is a 100 person que i believe and they have usually 50 more people waiting to get in so you either got to wait in that line until someone leaves or disconnects or you can pay to get a higher priority 150$ is the max 1 that gets you to the top ten list to fly in the city.
[1:05:12] favianayala97: Go to 134
[1:05:19] justinlacen: @chezzurbreadking they got banned

[1:07:10] ZaTaco: @justinlacen it is just because you dont kill someone doesnt mean its not vdm people can crash into your car purposefully and its still vdm
