[0:26:02] somegoya: people find comfort in being miserable sometimes
[0:26:03] USSJ2Iraija: @t1m916 yugHeyy

[0:26:21] nutbustar: wise
[0:26:21] tonyzeta: yugHeyy tim
[0:26:25] papooking: Gotta be careful with that wish. Some people's happiness is causing others suffering.
[0:26:33] rocket_monkey: yugHeyy
[0:26:38] TaleOfTwoWolves: you can't make ppl happy. Jesus Christ and Buddha couldn't do it. I gave up realizing that. But who am I to stop anyone from trying to do it. #change_the_world

[0:27:51] JustAGuyDrawing: yeah that's true
[0:28:02] papooking: But that's because you're a good person. If you think of human suffering, who causes it usually, other humans.
[0:28:03] TMKdk: yep love your self before others

[0:29:20] tonyzeta: Hmm
[0:29:22] TaleOfTwoWolves: If I give something, I don't expect anything in return. even a thank you.
[0:29:22] JustAGuyDrawing: that's interesting
[0:29:23] sshikke17: Like the movie The Menu

[0:29:52] BebopShock: @sshikke17 that was a good movie
[0:29:56] rocket_monkey: selfless
[0:29:57] redfalcon1000: I am not sure people choose to be givers or takers, although they can try and adjust their patterns, to some extent
[0:29:59] TaleOfTwoWolves: expectations are path to disappointment.
[0:30:00] tonyzeta: how much does jeff bezos give? Hmm
[0:30:04] TaraLovesSushi: I used to be like that
[0:30:20] inti_mate: people pleasers get taken advantage of people sometimes. sadly

[0:31:13] JustAGuyDrawing: 50 50 can also be bad
[0:31:21] TaraLovesSushi: Same
[0:31:40] TaraLovesSushi: Weed
[0:31:44] JustAGuyDrawing: it's when you start expecting something for everything you do is when it becomes bad

[0:37:23] TaraLovesSushi: As long as no more nukes
[0:37:25] TaleOfTwoWolves: i think it already exists to a degree. Malcolm X says you can still be free even if you're held in a prison. There's truth in it.
[0:37:35] somegoya: i think humans need to evolve past our instincts for that
[0:37:37] tonyzeta: it only takes one bad apple to ruin the bushel Shruge

[0:41:19] Aiwoo: it's stimulating the economy
[0:41:36] tonyzeta: OkaygeBusiness overpricing the cultural activity to put some in their pockets
[0:41:39] tonyzeta: Classic

[0:47:04] dero_: dont go there please
[0:47:09] TaraLovesSushi: Wouldn't ther3 be some sort of corruption among them since they dont make enough money?
[0:47:16] somegoya: it's like a gordian knot, an unsolvable puzzle
[0:47:20] TaleOfTwoWolves: it's fine. korean society don't really care imo. they support conformity; you can tell by their everyday living. same clothes.
[0:47:24] tonyzeta: the high ranked politicians
[0:47:25] dero_: fucking liberals are gonna clip this
[0:47:27] somegoya: too complex to possibly be successful

[0:48:19] trainedbuns: @aiwoo  yes
[0:48:20] rocket_monkey: thats how it works sometimes
[0:48:20] pach1nko: thats how it works
[0:48:23] Aiwoo: yugG
[0:48:29] TaleOfTwoWolves: yep in some way it's nepotism for the rich.
[0:48:50] JustAGuyDrawing: yeah that's how it should be
[0:49:15] TaraLovesSushi: All governments are corrupt for private interests
[0:49:18] shut_up_pickle: Did they finally Ban you from Korea? mwkEKW
[0:49:28] TaleOfTwoWolves: go to SINGAPORE. the gov't puts ppl over profits. they're the one of the richest nations per capita.
[0:49:30] somegoya: there should be checks and balances to ensure that happens.  it's difficult when the people in charge don't want that though
[0:49:42] TaleOfTwoWolves: SINGAPORE does have lots of strict laws though.
[0:49:48] tonyzeta: sadly, many politicians want these high positions for their own benefit
[0:49:53] USSJ2Iraija: Apparently it's to thicc for them to think that way
[0:49:55] who_vxm2: bc u can make more profit in gov't
[0:50:13] heng82: yes profit but own profit
[0:50:14] TaraLovesSushi: In america our supreme court justices are Gods. They rule all

[0:50:21] somegoya: power for the sake of power
[0:50:24] shut_up_pickle: Just come to the US and become a billionaire yuggie lol
[0:50:30] TaleOfTwoWolves: if I could afford Singapore, I'd move there for 5 years then retire.
[0:50:37] rocket_monkey: i guess they dont see it that way
[0:50:46] who_vxm2: their only job is to get reelected (sorry its true)
[0:51:05] heng82: they care their own pockets first
[0:51:07] rocket_monkey: yeah most just want to stay in power
[0:51:08] eestiteine: true
[0:51:12] TaleOfTwoWolves: if you want change, become the rich and then buy ppl. that's realistic.
[0:51:13] Briskhido: if the governments managed money like they do in companies they would be fired pretty quickly
[0:51:14] JustAGuyDrawing: LUL feels like that sometimes

[0:51:46] heng82: nv is enough,human are greedy
[0:51:51] rocket_monkey: its called greed
[0:51:53] eestiteine: good people dont go into politics
[0:51:57] USSJ2Iraija: It's a reason why politicians are called paid actors
[0:52:02] tonyzeta: when you're used to their lifestyle, it doesn't seem enough
[0:52:02] TaleOfTwoWolves: @tonyzeta ^^ @tonyzeta

[0:53:20] redfalcon1000: pool streams, hanbok cosplays
[0:53:26] TaleOfTwoWolves: gov't sometimes has separate agenda from its citizens
[0:53:39] trainedbuns: Just ask parliament what they do with your money
[0:53:41] USSJ2Iraija: They have a different agenda
[0:53:55] therebel_0: @TaleOfTwoWolves that‚Äôs an always thing.

[0:54:18] TaleOfTwoWolves: I'm trying to exist out of the system. work outside its influence. emphasis on trying.
[0:54:31] JustAGuyDrawing: that's a generalisation
[0:54:34] rocket_monkey: NODDERS

[1:00:10] JustAGuyDrawing: it does wound nice
[1:00:11] TaleOfTwoWolves: @shut_up_pickle oh
[1:00:14] makewarnotbabieszzz: utopia would be beautiful if humans could know all the answers of why life exists and how everything in the universe started drakeYes
[1:00:21] rocket_monkey: NODDERS

[1:00:36] rocket_monkey: would be cool to know
[1:00:51] TaleOfTwoWolves: Google 7th dimensional physics
[1:00:55] USSJ2Iraija: @who_vxm2 WeSmart
[1:00:58] Briskhido: we‚Äôre in simulation MrDestructoid
[1:00:59] TaraLovesSushi: Plz no religious debate DIESOFCRINGE
[1:01:01] JustAGuyDrawing: I think so
[1:01:01] shut_up_pickle: Lol Tell us about the yuggiverse
[1:01:02] rocket_monkey: probably
[1:01:15] tonyzeta: a random chemical reaction made us YEP
[1:01:20] Michael_LD25: KEKW

[1:01:43] PavelPatzelt: I agree
[1:01:52] Michael_LD25: HUH
[1:01:57] shut_up_pickle: Have you tried ravioli lasagna before?
[1:01:59] tonyzeta: bUrself
[1:02:08] TaleOfTwoWolves: Some entity will at some time in existence will be able to manipulate and control 7th dimensional physics. They literally could change the world to their conception.
[1:02:08] USSJ2Iraija: Surely, we all got a purpose to exist. When we have no answers and try to get into the deep depth of it, it makes it confusing yugThink
[1:02:17] redfalcon1000: bees are now in danger because of pesticids lobbies
[1:02:18] who_vxm2: the bees are in trouble yugNodd
[1:02:19] Aiwoo: goitn extinct
[1:02:20] Aiwoo: going

[1:02:25] Briskhido: without bees we would die Aware
[1:02:26] who_vxm2: yeah close enuf
[1:02:28] Ace_Lets_Go: I don't know singularity, doesn't actually make sense how the big bang or the universe exists. So best to focus on being kind while getting the most out of life.
[1:02:29] TaraLovesSushi: Hmm
[1:02:32] rocket_monkey: all die out
[1:02:33] shut_up_pickle: Going extinct

[1:02:34] USSJ2Iraija: extinct
[1:02:34] apexkilla20: Extinction ye
[1:02:42] apexkilla20: Bees are very important
[1:02:43] tonyzeta: bees are important for many plants to reproduces NODDERS
[1:02:48] PavelPatzelt: We have laws protecting bees
[1:02:51] USSJ2Iraija: Bees are important
[1:03:02] shut_up_pickle: Se
[1:03:12] USSJ2Iraija: Bumble bees are barely around anymore
[1:03:13] apexkilla20: Re populate basically
[1:03:17] JustAGuyDrawing: yeah they build their hives anywhere
[1:03:17] shut_up_pickle: Some bees are assholes
[1:03:20] TaleOfTwoWolves: Humans so far can only affect not control 4th dimensional physics/time manipulating gravity/5th dimensional physics.
[1:03:21] heng82: yea she moved them to a wooden crate
[1:03:24] rocket_monkey: relocate them?
[1:03:46] rocket_monkey: Modge
[1:03:49] eestiteine: Modge

[1:04:06] JustAGuyDrawing: yeah that is pretty cool
[1:04:06] tonyzeta: Hmm
[1:04:10] rocket_monkey: NODDERS save the bees
[1:04:16] TaraLovesSushi: Damn i wasnt reading chat
[1:04:37] apexkilla20: I'm not gonna lie when I was young out back shooting hockey pucks I used to wack the shit out of bees with my hockey stick, not knowing they're very important
[1:04:37] USSJ2Iraija: Like a role?
[1:04:37] shut_up_pickle: Lol
[1:04:41] therebel_0: national healthcare, minimum 2 year of free college, public housing paid for by the government, meaning, no more homelessness. focus on eradicating illnesses of all sorts such as cancers with no more tolerances, bullet trans to rival airliners so they can compete with each other, then we‚Äôll all win in the long run along with other upgraded trains. i can go on
[1:04:44] USSJ2Iraija: yugHmm
[1:04:45] apexkilla20: I'm stupid for that ngl
[1:04:52] Sizzlaa: yugCozii TeaTime

[1:05:41] VG2dGod: yugNotee got
[1:05:44] VG2dGod: it
[1:05:45] dero_: are you confusing meaning with purpose
[1:05:51] TaleOfTwoWolves: less than 10% of all bees can produce honey.

[1:06:46] Briskhido: yugHeyy hi Scivar
[1:06:46] somegoya: meaning and purpose are interchangable sometimes
[1:06:48] apexkilla20: My stingers in her flower I hope she let's me pollinate -childishgambino
[1:06:49] rocket_monkey: yugFat sounds like a good life
[1:06:54] USSJ2Iraija: @therebel_0 It's not so easy because there are many scientist, known and unknown, who try to eradicate such illness and sometimes get forcefully "logged_out" at a moments notice yugThink
[1:06:56] JustAGuyDrawing: yeah it's a purpose
[1:06:56] TaleOfTwoWolves: I love donuts until I ate a whole donut.

[1:07:37] shut_up_pickle: Have you tried to make them homemade since you watched those tutorials the other day?
[1:07:41] Ace_Lets_Go: Purpose and meaning are kind of Synonym in this context.
[1:07:43] JustAGuyDrawing: there can still be meaning in purpose though
[1:07:44] USSJ2Iraija: You can make and cook food for the homeless as a business and still feel that sense of fulfillment
[1:07:51] shut_up_pickle: I really think you can do it
[1:08:03] therebel_0: @USSJ2Iraija wawaShrug do we the people want that to stop? just asking.
[1:08:08] apexkilla20: U have to feel super blessed to be alive plain and simple, which most ppl take for granted
[1:08:16] tonyzeta: it could be the meaning of your own life, but not life in general Shruge
[1:08:16] Sizzlaa: smoke in the sky got me feeling so blue yugExcite
[1:08:18] USSJ2Iraija: In that sense, it can be a sense of purpose and meaning
[1:08:20] TaleOfTwoWolves: @Ace_Lets_Go I agree. Semantics I wouldn't want to argue the point if any difference.
[1:08:24] dero_: for me purpose is why do i continue, meaning would be why am i here
[1:08:26] apexkilla20: Shit my mom had like 3 miscarriages I feel super blessed

[1:09:06] TaleOfTwoWolves: I'm okay if I have different thoughts. Everyone is entitled to their belief and opinion just don't tread on mine.
[1:09:07] Briskhido: LifeTogether
[1:09:12] tonyzeta: what if you make your purpose the meaning of your life PepoThink WAYTOODANK
[1:09:15] apexkilla20: The chances of you being born are insane, actually insane

[1:09:54] rocket_monkey: yugHardTink
[1:09:58] USSJ2Iraija: @therebel_0 Of course. But there are things that's above higher power that's used. Gotta be careful with this topic though
[1:10:02] TaleOfTwoWolves: that used to be mine. then I babysitted. quickly changed my mind about having a family.
[1:10:02] shut_up_pickle: What's your utopia?
[1:10:23] somegoya: we're just the result of cyclic energy systems getting more complex over time, i don't think there's a meaning to the development

[1:12:44] Briskhido: MrDestructoid ‚ÄúThe meaning of life is a deeply personal and philosophical question that varies from person to person. Some find meaning in relationships, others in personal growth or contributing to society. Similarly, the purpose of life is subjective; it could involve finding fulfillment, pursuing passions, or striving for spiritual enlightenment. Ultimately, it's about discovering what brings significance and fulfillment to your own existence.‚Äù - ChatGPT Essaying

You've unknowingly become a beacon of warmth in my life, and I just wanted you to know how much it means to me. Keep being hot
