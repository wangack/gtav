[0:20:38] luig1i1: Maybe it matters more once you're at 100%?
[0:20:41] imSyndrine: use*
[0:20:43] perox89: moving zaza out of cypress takes a big total % away too, if it works that way
[0:20:43] tharomeyrome: @charzak Not all but some yea.
[0:20:45] babsie: do you think its because their people is on the same app as the strains thats why they can get their rep faster?
[0:20:47] Weekendrageguy: Anti cconflict but is out hubting cops
[0:20:48] kay0tic: yoru a family not a gang though ... no ?
[0:20:53] HealzonWheelzY: Hi sayeed how are you today? :D

[0:21:53] itsabitnutty: eco system
[0:22:01] hollywudsmkn_hogan: I wonder if rolling papers exist or if it's a blueprint or a unlock for weed selling @sayeedblack
[0:22:06] kay0tic: they are pushing anita on all apps i think.
[0:22:28] mogambo_khushhua: they changed zaza to sandy so the amount of zaza bags pushed are now being counted towards the turf rep in sandy @SayeedBlack
[0:22:31] kay0tic: anita gets the most $$ in sandy soo everyone is pushing anita I think.
[0:22:37] iLLuSi0NN: Did you talk with flash?
[0:22:40] elTigre_24: sayeedW
[0:22:51] VeteranClacky: watch harry start selling later and the bike cops get him LUL
[0:22:58] BEAN_PoWer: @mogambo_khushhua no it dont work like that for the turff rep

[0:23:47] reichenbachs: ooh
[0:23:52] hungarian_potato: is weed good money?
[0:23:52] GordonDavidPerry: could you grow a second strain for cypress?
[0:23:55] Dioxinn: Would be great to get another group up here and simply sell them bricks/baggies of scooby at like $750/brick and they keep the profit. EZ profit
[0:23:55] umathys: Hell yeah
[0:24:02] JuiceMayne: marty and larry will def be good pushers even harry if he can commit to it

[1:02:11] TyrantFPS: ilya shoud be promoted to like a soldier or something def not captain
[1:02:11] AdLib_24: Captain would be leading a crew, no?
[1:02:12] HallJams: octo doesn't oversee anyone
[1:02:14] KrazenSG: Octo doesnt have a crew, does he?
[1:02:15] splashhbroth3rr: captains have a side crew that they lead, nobody but Teddy does that
[1:02:17] Daemon_Hood: Poor tony man KEKL

[1:06:49] Deathchampt: so sefo no snakeing

[1:06:51] LuciferSpirt: abdul would go crazyt
[1:06:52] gurditn: There is no kick back on first 25k if kick back is in dirty money

[1:07:06] dark16sider: Abdul selling weed KEKW
[1:07:07] skaybe_: @jporte36 bro he is the top earner of the crew
[1:07:07] ZG3D: @jporte36 but he give the money to the crew
[1:07:11] nixi992: @IvyOlive don't you remember first week he was complaining about speedy's numbers and asked gigi to double check
[1:07:12] tripletuner: @jporte36 Say it louder PepeLaugh
[1:07:15] Flyty75: def need more grunts aka low level pushers @sayeedblack people hold block down for other crews to know this your turf
[1:07:16] LuciferSpirt: gonna be spicy when people dont bring 25k
[1:07:17] FloweryShirtGuy: @jporte36 Cause he pays his kick up every week like everyone else
[1:07:17] babsie: Lang is cooking.
[1:07:21] EhnOhSee: 25k test could make it spicy
[1:07:22] TyrantFPS: it depends if everyone has the 25k or not
[1:07:24] reichenbachs: @jporte36, he gives money to the crew wdym
[1:07:24] pqm11: @matt7x7x thats on luciano all the dons can operate how they want with non bought in people
[1:07:25] umathys: @Babushka_82 then you've been sleeping, cause the chat was filled with meta :D
[1:07:38] TropicalToucan: I think Abdul selling from his taxi would be hilarious 😂
[1:07:40] jekian33: i bet everyone can pay the 25k except for tony
[1:07:46] Foxxera_tv: Harry is the smart guy XD Always scaming
[1:07:56] temespeti: Harry brings in money he is just shnakey about it lmao

[1:08:31] chelle_mx: geegaEvil
[1:08:41] Sehpron: just a bit of trading
[1:08:42] tubbymantj: its in speedy's nature to be a bit of a snake tho its one of his traits haha

[1:08:56] redhoodsquad: LUL
[1:09:00] lunorx6: that not snaking that just proactive
[1:09:08] fenixblac: the only one that ever catches speedy is Lang eventually
[1:09:08] TyrantFPS: speedy a hustler not a snake
[1:09:09] C1st10b: min max life
[1:09:10] IvyOlive: not snaking just working hard
[1:09:13] jekian33: marty was right the system all along LUL LUL
[1:09:13] ZG3D: I think if 30% goes to the crew then there is nothing wrong with it
[1:09:15] the_whitz: I think bought in members need to have clear expectations. like they need to be either cleaning money or bringing in dirty money instead of only showing up on Fridays and paying dues then nothing else
[1:09:15] pqm11: ur a don u can don what u want
[1:09:20] kkillimanjaro: Yeah lol that's not even snaking ..
[1:09:46] SkyBlueSD: @jekian33 lol
[1:09:46] Moobot: Show some sayeedLOVE for the Speedy song sayeedTell sayeedTell sayeedTell https://soundcloud.com/outtotunetyrone/imtellinyou

[1:09:50] ruttystar: omg yo @sayeedblack I didn’t know u still stream my brother
[1:10:23] jporte36: Lang is really who needs called out.... How much money he make off materials? He got his start off all the guys and never really gave them anything.
[1:10:41] reichenbachs: @jporte36, he bought the house with his own money???
[1:10:53] umathys: @jporte36 mf... he has spent 250k on furniture ALONE yet alone all the other shit :D
[1:10:58] temespeti: he is hustlin outside of crew
[1:11:02] jporte36: @reichenbachs and he wants the money back LOL
[1:11:04] tivolimine: @jporte36 he just bought a house
[1:11:06] kkillimanjaro: It'd be stupid to call out Lang KEKW, esp if you're in the crew
[1:11:08] lelouchv200: @umathys true
[1:11:11] Maatch: lang is always crew first what is the guy saying lol
[1:11:19] jporte36: Lang wants the money back though... it wasn't good will
[1:11:21] reichenbachs: he used his money to buy GPUs, floors furniture and storage.
[1:11:22] jambag00: i think anyone can do anything once they pay up the 25k?
[1:11:23] TyrantFPS: lang has probably put in 750k into the crew
[1:11:24] togusaa: lang needs to be called out but dropped half a mil on a house and built most of the racks on his own time until the recent juice
[1:11:28] gurditn: Lang is providing mats to the crew at cost and losing money
[1:11:28] togusaa: okay chatters
[1:11:30] pqm11: lang literally does the bitch work in the crew lol
[1:11:31] KrazenSG: NGL @jporte36 your hatred is showing.
[1:11:31] splashhbroth3rr: @jporte36 he buys all the wood and walls and never got paid for it, you are delusional
[1:11:33] Icyywinds: lang has donated most of the time and money to the house and GPUs
[1:11:40] Foxxera_tv: lang empty is account for the 3 house what you saying my man XD
[1:11:40] Babushka_82: @jporte36 true he just paid to claim it but then need the money back sayeedPepe scheeming
[1:11:42] kkillimanjaro: As Speedy says - Lang is the leader
[1:11:48] watermelontoboggan: Lang has poured half a million into the crew and drives a van. Lol
[1:11:49] Darryl54321: All of thos gpus
[1:11:54] Slice0fBread: Lang made all his money by being smart and flipping materials
[1:12:01] Dioxinn: You guys really should up the number of people that do VU deposits. So much rolled cash sitting around.
[1:12:04] tripletuner: without Lang this crew would still operating at 20butc/day PepeLaugh
[1:12:09] its_neal: shpeeeeedy
[1:12:13] jambag00: i love that lang says hes not the leader when he clearly calls all the shots.. tis the control freak personality trait
[1:12:16] jekian33: Marty was right, lang is THE leader. I
[1:12:16] legion0222: It's just draining for him
[1:12:18] reichenbachs: but he doesnt want to be the leader but he's controlling KEKW
[1:12:18] jotello10: In my mind Arush is the leader.
[1:12:20] jporte36: Lang also took ALOT of crew money to build the house.... There wasn't good tracking then. Plus he does it all off stream, yall don't know how much money he spends LOL
[1:12:21] kkillimanjaro: And he is lol. He's pretty much the driving force/voice of the reason in the crew
[1:12:21] temespeti: arush is 2nd in command anyways
[1:12:27] Babushka_82: @krazensg chillllll
[1:12:30] TyrantFPS: every time lang tries to not be the leader but in reality is defacto leader
[1:12:33] its_neal: makes sense
[1:12:34] splashhbroth3rr: @jporte36 that just isn’t true LUL
[1:12:36] ozdemiir: Speedy should take 5% cut from his own new pushers take a cut like snr buns
[1:12:37] lunorx6: not the same timezone too
[1:12:38] IvyOlive: but Lang’s hustle is a good thing but Harry’s hustle gets called a scam
[1:12:39] chelle_mx: geegaNODDERS
[1:12:43] cabv10: cabv10 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 3 month streak! there is only one true kush king and that’s el jefe speedy

[1:12:48] its_neal: Lang is Lang
[1:12:52] jotello10: But seriously I think Gigi is the real leader. I'm telling you.
[1:12:52] reichenbachs: @jporte36, you're wrong
[1:12:57] splashhbroth3rr: @jporte36 the treasurer would see money missing, are you dumb?
[1:12:58] Slice0fBread: @jporte36 just admit you're a Lang hate watcher bro
[1:12:58] watermelontoboggan: @jporte36 sounds like you don't know and are assuming other people don't
[1:12:59] dark16sider: The crew structure and kick back system is intresting and new
[1:13:01] halfstepmadness: we couldn't know you if not for the boys
[1:13:04] Foxxera_tv: I think everyone is on the crew thinks like you tbh XD
[1:13:04] qvbxx: @jporte36 langs HUSTLE is mostly clean money if not ALL
[1:13:07] ozdemiir: @sayeedblack  why dont Speedy should take 5% cut from his own new pushers take a cut like snr buns?

[1:13:13] GordonDavidPerry: lang is the glue
[1:13:18] barer666: In the way that you guys structured the crew you can do that though can't you?
[1:13:19] Icyywinds: i think gigi is great but not leader material definitely boardmember/don vibes tho

[1:13:33] argonize: NODDERS
[1:13:35] martymagoo78: same with everyone is day… without lang Tony/Octo would be racing, Luci would be in the Italians and Harry would be on his own I think
[1:13:36] KrazenSG: @Babushka_82 I am chill. This guy is just hating on Lang no matter what. Thats all I pointed out. No being upset over here
[1:13:37] reichenbachs: please!
[1:13:37] pqm11: does speedy know marty hit 100%?
[1:13:38] legion0222: Marty about to be ready to push the block
[1:13:40] jporte36: actually, I love Lang, I just wonder how the crew doesn't call him out EVER.

[1:13:49] temespeti: poor Martin called Lang a leader too lmaoo
[1:13:51] halfstepmadness: Speedy marty larry is the same page
[1:14:05] its_neal: shpeedy do you miss old weed runs with lang and scuffed escape without octo
[1:14:09] splashhbroth3rr: @jporte36 bc nothing you said is true, call Lang out then what? he is the reason they have guns and heist progression
[1:14:14] zxJroc: @jporte36 they don't have the resume to say shit
[1:14:14] Babushka_82: @slice0fbread chilllll
[1:14:15] kkillimanjaro: I've been waiting forever for a proper convo between Marty and Speedy
[1:14:23] SkyBlueSD: Marty and Larry missed speedy so much
[1:14:30] legion0222: What sucks is marty and larry are more degen usually.  Not a ton of time overlap
[1:14:34] pqm11: feel like larrry is shy to call people
[1:14:35] reichenbachs: true
[1:14:37] kay0tic: anything that involves a war of number will be lost in the current format. Rust, EX-BSK and Seaside - all grinder crews.
[1:14:38] jekian33: @jporte36 Arush is the only one who has the balls to call out lang
[1:14:41] mogambo_khushhua: lang wanted to recruit him
[1:14:44] dome4days: Yeah Bubblez is still around
[1:14:48] EhnOhSee: i thought larry mentioned about him
[1:14:50] style959: flash as well
[1:14:53] jporte36: @jekian33 Exactly!
[1:14:55] matt7x7x: Larry was trying to get him in the crew
[1:15:03] ozdemiir: @sayeedblack why dont Speedy should take 5% cut from his own new pushers take a cut like snr buns??
[1:15:03] KidChameleon_: Baby Loco LUL
[1:15:15] Babushka_82: @jporte36 you good, not hating or nothing just giving opinion
[1:15:19] TyrantFPS: lang didnt reaize that was baby loco cuz he mixed him up woth carlito
[1:15:27] pqm11: i miss apple
[1:15:38] Suleman_aftab: lang wouldnt mind flash in the crew since hes pushing
[1:15:42] sid9002: The clean kids
[1:15:49] temespeti: but if you choose one, flash is great
[1:15:52] Puk3s: What's apple been up to
[1:16:00] ProphecyEU: Mix of old & new people NODDERS But Flash been earning his bones already with the boyz; Lot's of good people everywhere
[1:16:07] kidsuper05: Yahya Sadge
[1:16:10] snowmugs: yaya NOOOO
[1:16:12] jporte36: @Babushka_82 all I am saying is all that money he got and spends on house etc came from somewhere..... The beginning when he was keeping ALL materials from runs and not paying it out.
[1:16:19] Maatch: from weed they might be bought in who knows
[1:16:21] Lazzy_419: flag is my fav he’s such good vibes
[1:16:23] bigpharmaa: holy Chatting

[1:16:31] kidsuper05: Flash is amazing
[1:16:32] f2pOH: Chatting
[1:16:33] Lazzy_419: *flash

[1:16:49] shazzammxx: *gigi
[1:16:56] ozdemiir: Give them the 50% cut and take 5% cuz it's under your name/crew
[1:17:02] PedroTaco: pay decreased for grime?
[1:17:04] kidsuper05: Every single don has their people in the crew doing something idk you dont recommend people like flash who are such hard workers tbh
[1:17:19] KrazenSG: @jporte36 and you are failing to understand the situation. It is his clean job. Is speedy required to put his Grime money into the crew other than the kick up?
[1:17:20] jekian33: @kidsuper05 Facts.
[1:17:22] DuhJeezus: Buddha did say he missed the crew y’all had at the end of 3.0
[1:17:22] mogambo_khushhua: materials owed still
[1:17:26] watermelontoboggan: @suleman_aftab Only reason they are hesitant about flash is they want to have as many new people as possible. Flash would be in otherwise
[1:17:45] reichenbachs: LETSGO

[1:21:53] martymagoo78: and they will be paying with clean money so that is a big saving not cleaning
[1:21:57] DeejaysCrib: How can you lose profit of something not being sold LUL
[1:22:02] INSANE_SX: how many bags you get from a brick ?
[1:22:03] lightstormclaw: @mogambo_khushhua just instead of going to individuals it would all be going to the crew
