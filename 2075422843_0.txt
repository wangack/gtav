[5:06:20] Kthanid: All you can really do is raise your concerns and see where it goes I guess. katesShrug
[5:06:22] laxwall11: I mean even if this is how it's supposed to be, they need to rework it
[5:06:28] Insaif: I can't imagine you should have that much trouble, unless it really improves once your rep is high enough.
[5:07:10] doc_sharon: and if we are experiencing this in Sandy, other groups are too NODDERS
[5:07:14] mohler_47: it is just very touchy. Wade seems to have fewer problems, but I don't know what he is doing diffrently
[5:07:31] laxwall11: I also understand why the HOA stopped with weed as well
[5:08:00] kangg: so pulling the wrench caused the locals to either run away or attack every time?

[5:49:22] Ms_LadyMix: It's a sensory nightmare
[5:49:26] Shandercy: Wind pisses me off. It's my least favorite type of weather.
[5:49:30] brainbosh: Its a spectrum
[5:49:41] Ms_LadyMix: I hate the wind for the same reason, it makes me so horrifically grumpy

[5:51:46] laxwall11: I don't think anyone here that really watches you would think you are making a joke about it in a bad way
[5:51:51] Derkatronic: I don't mind swimming in a pool but swimming in ocean makes me madmad.  Thanks for the insight as usual

[7:55:39] doc_sharon: code of conduct violation KEKW
[7:55:48] laxwall11: As chaplain I think fucking the prospect is even worse.
[7:55:54] KarnEvil: katesSip
[7:56:02] tyrelrahl: Club above everything makes sense

[7:57:19] samflamen: katesStir
[7:57:20] Crafty_Crystal: I mean the same thing could happen with a President and their old lady. or a friendship in a club where they sleep with a club members wife. Relationships drama happens.
[7:57:22] KarnEvil: like a few weeks ago
[7:57:26] zemoj: so rue for chaplain when? :3
[7:57:29] Insaif: @AziraphalesShop Nope, this is all just lore and 4.0 events. Raiders didn't exist in 3.0.

[7:58:23] AlliLovesGiraffes: A loophole clause?
[7:58:26] CranApple_Juice: ok im back to being beyond confused again
[7:58:32] Insaif: Good thing that's something Maxx has zero interest in. katesSmile
[7:58:54] Crafty_Crystal: okay but not allowing relationships in something you have to be blooded out for is unfair if people do fall in love.
[7:58:59] laxwall11: Time to kick the baby
[7:59:00] doc_sharon: well they all think it's read katesMadge
[7:59:05] doc_sharon: * real

[7:59:53] lorddracnor: @laxwall11 don't kick the baby!
[7:59:56] A_Humble_Wooper: Or that, good point sharon. There are lots of other clubs where relationships are permitted.
[7:59:56] Kthanid: You just. DON'T
[7:59:57] Crafty_Crystal: because that’s something people can help katesGiggle

[8:00:35] Hoocairz: Being attracted to someone doesn't mean you have to act on it
[8:00:49] hanofearl: I’ve seen breakups tear apart friend groups, it can be really awful
[8:00:53] A_Humble_Wooper: You may not be able to help catching feelings, but you danged sure can help whether you ACT on those feelings. If you don't have that much self control, there's bigger issues than the feelings.
[8:01:05] doc_sharon: you don't have a romantic relationship with your family

[8:52:26] witchmina: NODDERS
[8:52:30] A_Humble_Wooper: Yesyes
[8:52:34] pickleviiiic: Tom fully fucked up.
[8:52:34] laxwall11: Many times
[8:52:41] Insaif: Oh, he knew ALL the things he should have not done, and did it anyway.
[8:52:42] kangg: that’s how the cookie crumbles barbKEKD
[8:52:46] lorddracnor: Tom swan dived on to a minefield of his own making
[8:52:50] doc_sharon: it's like he did not listen Madge
[8:52:55] AziraphalesShop: I have sympathy for Tom, but Maxx is right.
[8:53:09] doc_sharon: Man needs to work on his confidence katesMadge
[8:53:22] Insaif: I appreciate that about Wade.
[8:53:23] doc_sharon: and that is why we love Wade katesL
[8:53:27] laxwall11: Nope and that's why he is great
[8:53:30] kangg: nope
[8:53:31] Kthanid: All Wade will care about is if causes a club issue.
[8:53:31] IchibaToll: Yeah, Wade may actually have no idea about any of it, and wouldn't say anything if he did.
[8:53:33] AshuraX13: We love Wade for that
[8:53:39] arbucklezero: It's always grind time
[8:53:42] jedi_raccoon: Wade is a homie katesL
[8:53:53] A_Humble_Wooper: I would too, in her shoes.
[8:53:55] Kthanid: Understandable.
[8:53:55] laxwall11: Yeah I bet
[8:53:56] DirectorStephanie: Wade is my home katesL
[8:53:59] A_Humble_Wooper: I think almost anyone would.
[8:54:01] doc_sharon: especially right after getting command katesMadge
[8:54:01] tyrelrahl: Genuine question:  Will Maxx withdraw from the club at all due them being apart of this?
[8:54:03] Thorn104: I wonder how Wade would react knowing what Maxx did after that chat at the bar before they met back up in Los Santos..
[8:54:11] AziraphalesShop: I love that we've come from Beard  vowing to take down Vault Tec, to here
[8:54:12] kangg: katesJuice
[8:54:13] DirectorStephanie: I would be mortified too, poor gal.
[8:54:20] Hoocairz: Wade is the perfect homie to roll with after that
[8:54:33] doc_sharon: Maxx is still who she is, she does not need to change NODDERS
[8:54:33] laxwall11: He opened his mouth
[8:54:34] Denetti_: Maxx to Wade, "he's taking some me time", Maxx to Lane, "it's dealt with", Did Maxx kill Tom? katesGiggle
[8:54:34] ThomasTheDestroyer: The funny thing to me is that if Tom had tried to tell Wade, I feel like Wade would have been the one to respond with "Why are you telling me this? Tell her."
[8:54:44] tyrelrahl: I meant emotionally.  Not from the Raiders as a group
[8:54:47] Kthanid: Hell, she's pissed at Tom, but he's still a club member.
[8:54:47] CranApple_Juice: i forgot to order my cheeseburger xdd
[8:54:51] 4taog: yeah, Mason and Wally at least seemed to keep it to themselves. Rue was the one stirring.
[8:54:56] fattydelrey: killed him emotionally
[8:54:58] A_Humble_Wooper: @Denetti_ he's just walking back from the mountain they had a talk on.
[8:55:09] Hoocairz: @denetti_ just his hopes and dreams
[8:55:12] Denetti_: @A_Humble_Wooper I know I'm just kidding
[8:55:15] doc_sharon: Smadge
[8:55:19] sharingiskaren: @4taog and Bev
[8:55:30] laxwall11: Just a week after being made RC too
[8:55:30] arbucklezero: That's like 3 whole emotions!
[8:55:38] Kthanid: Time to Fort Knox this bitch.
[8:55:38] doc_sharon: closing those doors tighter katesMadge
[8:55:44] AziraphalesShop: He'll probably call Mason or Wally for a ride
[8:55:53] witchmina: great stuff for the story katesJuice
[8:55:55] IchibaToll: Is that his hacker fit?  Because the bow tie is not what I expected.
[8:56:01] doc_sharon: Bev katesSus
[8:56:02] IchibaToll: LUL
[8:56:06] Insaif: It's a shame because everyone needs someone to be able to confide in, and I don't think Maxx will get that again.
[8:56:13] KarnEvil: KEKW
[8:56:16] A_Humble_Wooper: I feel like most people have walls around their feelings... Maxx has a 20 foot thick concrete nuclear bunker shell over hers.
[8:56:21] doc_sharon: 2 days to the 29th, Bev MaxxRoll SmokeTime
[8:56:36] laxwall11: Lots of drinking for Maxx in the future I see

[10:34:30] Kthanid: Valid.
[10:34:31] laxwall11: Yup
[10:34:33] doc_sharon: yeah, it because a trust issue so fast NODDERS
[10:34:40] Pleasantmsp: Understandable
[10:34:46] Insaif: Do you think there's any chance for redemption at all for Tom in Maxx's eyes?
[10:34:50] rickbuh: and it can't be a secret thing if he already told everyone
[10:35:04] doc_sharon: yeah it was already not secret KEKW
[10:35:23] GenuineMind: I honestly like this more. This feels more unpredictable about the future than just being together until everyone finds out.
[10:36:10] laxwall11: Maxx has no money Lane lol
[10:36:17] nvrsmc: what’s the tldr on the Tom situation? I missed it
[10:36:41] Hoocairz: I think this is the much more interesting route
[10:37:03] KarnEvil: picks are so pricy for how few uses they have.
[10:37:04] doc_sharon: BLESS KEKW
[10:37:29] KarnEvil: can bikes have turbos?
[10:37:43] doc_sharon: this way, you can focus Maxx on the club, not on relationship drama with chat.  Yesyes
[10:38:01] doc_sharon: totally MaxxRoll
[10:38:04] Kthanid: Maxx has a few targets to pick from with her anger, Tom, Bev, Rue, etc.
[10:38:23] abblepiewit: if he was properly nice he'd respect boundaries and not yap so much, tbh
[10:38:24] kay_bs0919: I’d love to see the character development that would come from Mac trusting someone to be in a relationship
[10:38:25] GenuineMind: The only downside to not having these two in a relationship is that we can't use the ship name Toxx
[10:38:28] UppyFF: Tom tried to fly into the sun and was suprised he got burnt pearbrSuffer
[10:38:40] Shandercy: I remember saying "Poor Tom" once, and it was specifically because he was being fucking dense. It was my version of a Southern "Oh, bless your heart" KEKW
[10:38:57] Jorsh029: We love the spice, even when it hurts sometimes pearbrL
[10:39:01] doc_sharon: yeah, this way, Maxx has shut herself off pretty tightly NODDERS
[10:39:11] A_Humble_Wooper: Nothing's impossible, but if Tom ever wants to rebuild that bridge he's got a long STEEP hill to climb.
[10:39:16] Carbonfated: @UppyFF or flew too close to a black hole and was spaghettified
[10:39:23] Pleasantmsp: I like this option more but that's just me. And I've been jokingly open about not really being into Maxx/Tom as a couple. But I do recognize that seeing a relationship bt them would've been very spicy NODDERS
[10:39:36] Jorsh029: @a_humble_wooper so your saying a Sisyphean task? katesGiggle

[10:41:19] abblepiewit: most of the meatballs (options) would be spicy, yeah.
[10:41:23] Pleasantmsp: Plus, if Maxx ever does get into a relationship, it'll be that much more impactful because of everything she's been through not just in her past but also in the city

[10:42:01] doc_sharon: And if Maxx does not ever get in a relationship, that is fine too Yesyes
