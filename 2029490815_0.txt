[5:22:16] searlesbarkleyk: seems obvious they'd need a warrant to read the book. It's not like cops go into peoples phones when they get arrested its the same shite
[5:23:04] ProngsAedan: Usually head kill ruins the trophy but it does mean good pelt and meat. Heart kill is cleaner.
[5:23:14] 3hops: Phones are locked and have an expectation of privacy

[5:25:03] mortaldictata117: @ProngsAedan doesnt multiple body shots irl make the meat go bad quicker bc release of hormones and whatnot?
[5:26:53] ProngsAedan: @mortaldictata117 Yup 100% that is why it's always a single sure shot to the heart and head if one does not care about the trophy.
[5:27:30] locknessloser: Does anyone know what the guy in sandy is for that Tony found week 1?
[5:28:00] turbodyrock: in the wrong chat buddy
[5:28:11] badguyzrules: Cat bait would be a good idea
[5:28:31] badguyzrules: Get this fuckers back
[5:28:36] searlesbarkleyk: maybe can make dog food
[5:28:44] mortaldictata117: @ProngsAedan thought so, I either read or heard that somewhere, which makes sense
[5:29:21] ishouldprobably: I'm tellin ya the heads and carcasses are going to be used to make senior nuggies and hot dogs

[5:31:52] OriginalGibsta: No way that will be abused right? Right?? oop
[5:31:53] badguyzrules: Masks next maybe?
[5:31:59] ProngsAedan: @mortaldictata117 It's vital organs like I said. Brain, Heart, or double lungs. Lungs mean better blood trail, but that is so messy and again makes them scared and might ruin the meat if the shot wasn't clean. So the heart is the best option. :D
[5:32:15] zachpresident: now can you recycle bad weed bricks or bags? easy clean up of illegal goods! call Harry today LUL
[5:32:43] SekretAznMan: KEKLEO

[5:32:50] yujiiro18: classic
[5:32:51] TripleDekeConway: What the hell is a Wally?
[5:33:02] BakoStoner661HD: @mortaldictata117  not true most hunters for stags don't shoot in the head and it's not for meat its for accuracy and to ensure a kill rather than a knick/injury, if you bleed it right it will be fine regardless
[5:33:05] goodtimes54: @mortaldictata117 yeah but the odds of success are much smaller. i've never met a hunter that aimed for the head cause they might save a lb or 2 of meat
[5:33:12] frank_knutts: wally is an idiot
[5:33:20] unclefester1112: lol

[6:00:32] EncryptiiiC: @blazin_4 its 10k so it would I guess
[6:00:34] BaldScooter: surely that’s a one time fix for taxes not being on the purchase right?
[6:00:35] Mr__Muggles: why is tax coming in the middle of the month too
[6:00:59] tzloaf: "this meeting could've been an email"
[6:01:07] Mr__Muggles: oh yeah it might be the tax from purchase that was missing
[6:01:10] blazin_4: oh I didn’t know they were doing 10k now

[6:01:57] scotty2thotty18: I hope they won't have asset tax
[6:02:56] AdRoKa_: Guess it's cool they don't make you pay that up front
[6:03:21] mortaldictata117: asset fees didnt really work during 3.0 so hopefully the staff  and devs figured out how to regulate that
[6:03:29] goodtimes54: 76
[6:03:29] lamby478: harrWiggle

[6:05:50] mortaldictata117: @scotty2thotty18 yeah I know, but hopefully they consulted an economist on how to hypothetically keep the server economy in check without it being too real OMEGALUL
[6:05:59] EnzikFires: i hope not paying house tax etc lets them repossess assets on the server, keep it healthy
[6:06:18] pootie2goood: Wonder if Teddy has ever done anyother jobs around the city
[6:06:35] pootie2goood: Or just started on Sani and never switched

[6:13:37] Mr__Muggles: otherwise people can move like 150kg of weed which is 150,000 bags
[6:14:22] RoddBlack: @Mr__Muggles Think we just have to think about weight differently from real life
[6:15:40] Niktory: if it was like .5 of an ounce a bag could be 14g and then you could have like 9 bags to be under 130 that would make sense

[10:24:39] chilibeesechurger: is there different types of seed?
[10:24:46] Bupiniak: Why does it remove "drug seeds", it should say "weed seeds", no?
[10:24:53] TastyKudzu: I'm a bit behind. Did Harry ever discuss suing over his 4th amendment right being violated when they searched his papers without a warrant?
[10:25:33] shyness_1: not raining today
[10:25:42] DeadAssYeetOnEm: maybe since its out in the wild, It wont ever be consistent. Maybe until like grow ops inside a house will it be more consistent/better
[10:25:52] BreaKereN: They cant use it against you, but do they still "have" the knowledge of what was in it
[10:26:06] KrisCat: @BreaKereN yeah, they can't remove that unfortunately lol
[10:26:08] TastyKudzu: That's interesting. Must be because Nopixel is different from the US law then. Because in the US what they did was an actual constitutional violation of your rights. They can shake out the book to check for drugs or weapons but they can't read it without a warrant.
[10:26:36] SergeGray: The map looks lovely
[10:26:42] EKANA_STONE: They can maybe put a gag order on it, remove it. Make it inadmissible
[10:27:32] KrisCat: @TastyKudzu yeah, they've never had it regarding notebooks because most ppl kept secret group stuff in the phone documents that cops could never access.
[10:27:44] EKANA_STONE: But obviously that won't take harry off the polices radar. Any cop that knows will have it in the back of there mind
[10:28:35] TastyKudzu: @KrisCat Gotcha. That's literally the "papers" part in the 4th amendment so it's just a NP thing then. No matter what happens I'm really enjoying seeing the boys use Ramee as a lawyer.
[10:28:53] quote_me_if_horsen: i hope fishing is soon. the grow spot is good for fishing
[10:29:11] KrisCat: Ramee is a great lawyer
[10:29:21] blacksmith1095: So if you hit a deer with that car does that mean you clubbed it to death
[10:30:03] TastyKudzu: @blacksmith1095 in a similar vein, if you take a girl for a ride in the car could you tell people the two of you went clubbing?
[10:30:18] blacksmith1095: LUL

[12:08:02] TastyKudzu: That's like a gallon ziplock bag.
[12:08:03] CyanMig: 500g is a huge amount for a baggy
[12:08:04] Benson_666_: that would be a pound
[12:08:04] SergeGray: does this mean you've got 50kg bricks lol

[12:08:16] ferlUno: bag*
[12:08:18] timesealer623: That's a big bag LUL
[12:08:21] budogorilla: 28.35
[12:08:23] Coolrey3: 112 g a quarter pound
[12:08:23] xRuntZzz: 500g is rappers weed LUL
[12:08:28] dort420: trash bag?
[12:08:29] ecks_queue_see_l: that's a fat bag of schwag
[12:08:37] SchlepRock99: thats like 18oz per baggy. lol
[12:08:39] cosnik: silly devs not knowing the streets
[12:08:45] Bill_Collector: Yes
[12:08:54] timesealer623: Half a kilo of weed is a shit ton
[12:08:55] Idejder: that means one plant make 100 lbs of weed? lol
[12:08:59] choppajog: who buyin half a gram
[12:09:00] CyanMig: 50 bags would be 25 kg of weed, lol
[12:09:06] xxTOPPExx: None of these devs have dabbled in the devil's lettuce I see
[12:09:09] feralpancake_: tell to the devs not judgem probbaby mistake
[12:09:29] Bill_Collector: More than one bag is a felony right?
[12:09:29] cosnik: realistically thatd be round 7g
[12:09:31] slapch33ks: @harry keep in mind the runs are to dealers not like cornering to individual customers
[12:09:31] timesealer623: Probably for balance cus of weight
[12:09:41] childgoose: Probably just there so people dont hold too many at once
[12:09:45] garythesistafista: @Harry 28g = 1 oz, 4 oz = 1/4 lb so 112g = 1/4 lb
[12:09:47] HallJams: I think they're developing laws so maybe it'll get worked out after elections
[12:10:00] naruuth: maybe it just meant to be the weight it occupies in your pockets as carrying capacity, but not the literal weight of the baggy?
[12:10:01] Zmanic: the weight is probably for inventory the law should base it on quantity not weight
[12:10:03] Bill_Collector: I understand law makers just keeping it simple by saying more than one bag is obviously intent to sell
[12:10:08] budogorilla: I was watching cops yesterday, 116g is felony amount
[12:10:09] Idejder: @slapch33ks Even then, the way they buy multiple bags that means one person is buying SEVEN POUNDS of weed?
[12:10:12] BasedBruh: Ye but its not a law issue, its a description issue.
[12:10:22] SergeGray: your honor its only 28g of weed, its just the plastic bag is very heavy
[12:10:28] spectre007_endplease: What's the weight of a dried bud and divide it by 50
[12:10:28] SchlepRock99: 500g is like 1lbs
[12:10:43] Idejder: oh that makes sense
[12:10:45] timesealer623: YEP
[12:10:54] slapch33ks: @idejder don't disagree with the weight but these aren't individual baggies, they're dealer deliveries
[12:10:55] skyyPIE: Probably easier for them to change the written law than adjust the weight and balancing that
[12:10:57] RocketNova100: harrNODDERS
[12:10:59] ItsHicham_: yeah so in law, it should be quantity, not weight
[12:11:08] Bill_Collector: @skyypie yeah
[12:11:09] PrismaPalma: 0.5kg its a lot of weed
[12:11:20] Zmanic: yep law should be quantity
[12:11:22] Idejder: @slapch33ks what harry just said makes total sense. It's weight is there as a balance mechanic so you cant carry around 6000 baggies on you, but it conflicts with the whole justice department
[12:11:32] timesealer623: Harry bug reporting left and right, full on wildlife expert at this point LUL
[12:11:36] AlexanderMichael: "weed bag weight breaks mah immersion"
[12:11:38] Bill_Collector: The law should definitely be quantity instead of weight since the weights are consistent
[12:11:42] xRuntZzz: Maybe its meant for inventory weight?
[12:11:57] asimoviic: F8 window if bossible OMEGALUL
[12:12:05] mosi0098: maybe its 450g of bag and 50g of weed
[12:12:08] slapch33ks: @idejder for sure the published law as written is not consistent with the mechanics
[12:12:52] naruuth: should probably be no more than 2 baggies on your person at a time. or just possession
[12:12:58] Idejder: lmao @mosi0098  that would be a hilarious tooltip for the devs to add.  "1oz of weed, 470g of bag"
[12:12:59] despicablewebb: go ask them Hmmm
[12:13:01] RiS1bLe: precedence
[12:13:16] museumpiece: no other indica's er um indices
[12:13:18] xxTOPPExx: I'd say find out in rp buddy...lol jk jk
[12:13:22] HallJams: it's based on law not police sop
[12:13:24] TastyKudzu: You should be able to look up the law for it at city hall no? You can't have secret laws and hold people accountable.
[12:13:24] despicablewebb: find out in rp YEP
[12:13:26] ItsHicham_: but shouldnt that be public knowledge
[12:13:32] feralpancake_: 500 gram bag is just too big, you can't carry 100 bags on you like you do. And it's worth more than 100 bucks
[12:13:33] kSwong9: Maybe get a judge or lawyer to look into it?
[12:13:35] obscurewill: imo better to find out from a law than from a cop lol
[12:13:43] TabbyRoom72: I wouldn’t but report it until the new laws come in
[12:13:48] Zmanic: are the laws not public like before?
[12:13:49] TabbyRoom72: bug*
[12:13:49] potatowarrior411: maybe but it doesnt hurt to report just incase its an oversight
[12:13:53] PrismaPalma: 10 bags is 5 kg irl this a lot lot
[12:13:55] yahmobethere: They would go by the weights in the law
[12:13:56] lordcooterkilla: mist be something for the council to decide on, plus the legality of weed in general.
[12:14:10] Nigel___Thornberry: what’s the lasted with your case? earlier ramee said there’s been updates and was setting up a meet?
[12:14:10] CruelSally: it is an exorbitant amount
[12:14:14] Bill_Collector: They might see the report and think of a way to clarify it in the UI yeah
[12:14:20] Idejder: @PrismaPalma it also means each brick of weed is 100lb of weed
[12:14:23] Idejder: which is an insane amount
[12:14:25] Bill_Collector: Makes sense to increase immersion
[12:14:26] chilibeesechurger: maybe you’re supposed to put it in smaller baggies
[12:14:26] xero_out: How much does a brick weigh for comparison?
[12:14:27] Coolrey3: you could fill a room with that much
[12:14:31] rhythmkiller: thats a fuck ton of weed lmao
[12:14:32] RagingSantas: Should mention that brick is a misdemeanor
[12:14:34] TastyKudzu: Sometimes the weights are just wacky. How many hundreds of kilos of wood were used to make the very small computer desk?
[12:14:44] Bill_Collector: The wood is hilarious
[12:14:47] PrismaPalma: @Idejder do you know how much that is in kg?
[12:14:58] budogorilla: With how heavy your bags are you must be supplying the neighborhood dealers
[12:14:58] ktothec99: Just point out the inconsistency between bags and the other form factors when it comes to weight and the law.
[12:14:58] PrismaPalma: @Idejder like 40kg?
[12:15:05] Scaz675: Chatting
[12:15:07] Bill_Collector: Need half a forest to build a desk
[12:15:11] asimoviic: Arent all the deer hunting stuff super light
[12:15:14] juicexgx: yeah a weed baggie weighing over 1 pound is a little weird
[12:15:24] PrismaPalma: @Idejder that an entire farm KEKW
[12:15:35] HallJams: weight of inventory item vs weight of substance
[12:15:37] BasedBruh: A brick would weight less than the bag LUL
[12:15:45] Idejder: @PrismaPalma 500g (each bag) is ~1lb. That means each brick is 50,000g, or 50kg of weed at least
[12:15:46] kSwong9: Yeah a description saying contains x amount of weed is probably any easy fix
[12:15:55] TKanjii: 500g of weed is mad money irl too
[12:16:05] rhythmkiller: as a software dev i prefer my qa to make a useless bug report then no bug reports
[12:16:13] juicexgx: if a weed baggie really is a whole pound you should me making more money haha
[12:16:19] juicexgx: be*
[12:16:23] Bill_Collector: It's a pound of dirt weed
[12:16:25] PrismaPalma: @Idejder Jesus that is a lot KEKW
[12:16:46] jerrod0504: @juicexgx facts irl haha
[12:16:53] asimoviic: Solution could be adding 5g to the weed back icon

[12:38:55] Coelacanth88: Mans is scooting
[12:39:01] TastyKudzu: So when you were talking about striking at sanitation the other day I realized that you only need 7 people to shut down sanitation. They each queue as their own group, accept a job, then just sit on it for the full 45min. Even if you beat them down they don't lose the job. It's actually crazy easy to shut down the whole job.
[12:39:05] azorott: I think just me nvm
[12:39:46] Vakarius: @TastyKudzu You need 14 people, you can only start jobs as 2 person crews or more
[12:40:02] quote_me_if_horsen: cant do 1 man now?
[12:40:18] iOnlySMOrc: Pog soda machine
[12:40:29] mechabananas: never thought i would hear those words again
[12:40:33] TastyKudzu: @Vakarius Oh I didn't know that. That's at least more people but still not a whole lot to shut down the entire source of mats for the city.
