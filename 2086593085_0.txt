[3:50:22] yearzzero: but it’s been days ago
[3:50:28] MountainMAN1990: No one has had that talk really...
[3:50:35] tuvix2: Has Raymond forgotten JP told them he was going to rob the company?
[3:50:40] retrolyk: there is really no need for all project managers to go inside the main house
[3:50:41] bordado123: Will you plot something to JP in the future?

[3:50:56] MountainMAN1990: A year hooooly
[3:51:06] MountainMAN1990: HE WAFFLED MANY TIMES
[3:51:08] jackthedazzle: @Ray__C tbh, jp been hang out cg a lot but he doesnt around for many days anymore because he just wake up depend days
[3:51:16] rielarienz: Yeah he did say that
[3:51:18] gateloz452: Only Perez, kj and breakers use the house. You guys could give them keys but not furniture and wall off the racks since u guys aren't expanding anymore
[3:51:22] tuvix2: Lol, you still trusted him when he had a plan to rob you all
[3:51:24] StreamElements: Ray has an active Insta that you can use to stay up to date with him! raycHypeInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/raycgaming/

[3:52:04] MountainMAN1990: @jackthedazzle he has no goal in RP anymore is why he needs a new rainbow dongle puzzle
[3:52:07] yearzzero: I hate how Raymon is being negative t a boss ….. call the shots
[3:52:22] jackthedazzle: @MountainMAN1990 yea not just jp, all of ppl
[3:52:24] eruhen17: @ResseL Yeah, you would never forgive anyone for doing that
[3:52:43] Bleepinbloopin: peepoHigh love it
[3:52:48] jackthedazzle: @MountainMAN1990 because lot rpers and gang waiting new stuff
[3:52:57] tuvix2: Being betrayed by someone who told you they were going to do it is no reason to distrust current loyal members of the company
[3:52:57] theenyyy: !Schedule
[3:52:58] RaycBot: New schedule pog around 8am PST Tuesday to Thursday! raycHype Weekend times are RST BUT possibly longer streams raycHype Join the !discord for accurate times!
[3:52:58] MountainMAN1990: @jackthedazzle yeah but the really good RPers dont need that ultimate goal
[3:53:05] ResseL: @eruhen17 well.. forgive maybe. but forget? never
[3:53:22] jackthedazzle: @MountainMAN1990 i mean we could see toonyShrug but now you only doing grind money
[3:53:25] JellyCraven: LUL
[3:53:44] tuvix2: Ok,  we disagree on this i guess
[3:53:45] prayge_: Why give keys if they have no need for them. I dont get it.
[3:54:01] Mr_Jhin4: daily reminder : characters can lie
[3:54:01] L0KIDota: any tv shows you watching lately @Ray__C
[3:54:05] isaias_lion: Rather then disagree I think it's just "I want my streamer to have access". It makes no sense for the 4 of you to share your only safe place. It is impossible to trust anyone fully ever again.
[3:54:16] itzyoumanz: worst part, set jp down a bad path
[3:54:17] tuvix2: My point is that you should trust current loyal members
[3:54:37] nckap1: its all RP at the end of the day good content.
[3:54:45] JusticeDredd_: COOKED
[3:54:48] rdkni: @prayge_ because of expanding group if you dont want give keys that mean you dont trust ppls and you will be forever alone
[3:54:50] retrolyk: the conversation at legion park when yuno left too, JP showed them he really wanted to lead
[3:54:52] MountainMAN1990: @tuvix2 it's not about the managers..... it's not even about JP really. It's about Ray "letting it happen" and hes mad
[3:55:13] johnsimmons9: sly was hyped because it meant he could craft guns for BSK
[3:55:16] yearzzero: ray walk in tomorrow in the meeting and say what you have to say but bring up the idea of  being the ceo for at least a day so they can see how things change with you as ceo
[3:55:17] olmsarat: a second house with them solves everything tbh
[3:55:17] maxster_ttv: that is trust to an extent
[3:55:19] rdkni: ppls will never give to the company 100% effort if the dont have keys
[3:55:23] inso17: they do need keys tho
[3:55:27] gateloz452: There isn't really anything in the house ppl need access to. It came up when OTT said brekkers should get a key because he's the closest project manager to a board member
[3:55:29] JusticeDredd_: Its early days with the Project Managers, so it will take time for these things to happen... sit back, chill and enjoy the RP
[3:55:31] johnsimmons9: 3-1 buddy
[3:55:32] pierrot9998: when are you going to buy this house
[3:55:35] moneybroskis: @johnsimmons9 he can do that without being in the house tho
[3:55:54] StreamElements: Ray now makes 3 WEEKLY Youtube Vids - Subscribe to support your streamer raycL - Main Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/raycgaming
[3:55:57] xcond1: didn't raymond say something that only perez is good to get keys?
[3:56:03] yearzzero: it’s time for Raymond to play his part
[3:56:04] Th3GalacticTV: Well the goal is to get a Warehouse as an open Company HQ for everyone anyway
[3:56:11] RajinKatakuri: kj’s probably the only that needs of all the managers
[3:56:16] gateloz452: Perez is trustworthy
[3:56:18] rdkni: buying 500k house just for the scare of give keys for 2k $ LULW
[3:56:33] itzyoumanz: a lock for room doors would be great
[3:56:36] jackthedazzle: remember 2 month ago when x choose cypress for weed seller the company. I feel like we still ongoing legacy since x left even established name back at early december @Ray__C
[3:56:36] RoSki_Bruhh: hi
[3:56:36] Bleepinbloopin: Perez seems to have given up on moonshine anyway
[3:56:37] moneybroskis: @rdkni Scared of a jp incident.

[3:57:40] terranausorous: And ray hasnt hang out with the other project managers that much compared to mickey or benji since most of them are awake in NA
[3:57:46] moru22: back to old schedule?
[3:57:49] moneybroskis: @rdkni brother take a chill pill
[3:57:49] veviico: I think kj needs it for the anita app, so he can add and remove weed ppl when yall aren't awake
[3:57:51] JusticeDredd_: dont make me raycBonk you lol

[4:03:39] gateloz452: Maybe project managers can vote like a jury and have 1 vote
[4:03:54] yearzzero: that’s to big
[4:04:11] Kidans_: @gateloz452 This is a good idea
[4:04:26] n0oxaskek: it should be 75% in 25% out as a basis
[4:04:29] yearzzero: for the board to vote for everyone is crash
[4:04:44] Th3GalacticTV: Project managers are kind of biased toward their respectiv ex gang leader tho
