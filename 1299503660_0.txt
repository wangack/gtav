[8:20:58] RVIV_: math gives me a headache
[8:21:05] AgeOfTheGeek: @c4itl4n Pls share LUL
[8:21:06] friedmombo: the abc change and the equations themselves change

[8:21:26] CplDarkeye: @dariuxas1393 oh apparently they change so fuck KEKW
[8:21:28] DubiousDelirium: Uh oh. Random number theory is making a mild reappearance. uhnKek
[8:21:29] JimJamGG: 4 keypads, 4 equations, maybe 4 different red lockbox sets each with their own ABC combo?
[8:21:41] shuffling321: @friedmombo yeah but the equations have common parts like A*B*C/A+B+C/A+(B+1/2 etc which you can pre-compute
[8:21:41] CloudComputing: @shuffling321 if you consider negative integers, in some puzzles there are aroung 800 possibile solutions
[8:21:49] wondervviener: Freddy would rather do the 8 hack in a row, than do math at this point KEKW
[8:21:49] TheGodfather2994: please no random numbers uhnSuffer uhnSuffer
[8:21:57] railhz: @JimJamGG pepeW thats a visual glitch
[8:21:59] space_jams: could be both lockboxs, middle ring number,  inner ring number in the order that the prompt puts them
[8:22:02] Lafayette74: uhnGiga All this math
[8:22:04] CplDarkeye: but then them doing 114 all the time would obviously give wrong answers like half the time anyway LUL
[8:22:06] CloudComputing: if the domain is Real numbers, the solutions are infinite
[8:22:06] RVIV_: is a heist a puzzle or an equation
[8:22:07] dariuxas1393: @CplDarkeye you ignore the equations and the one person on the computer just shuffles the numbers in the correct a b c formation and tells the others
[8:22:10] Veineless: I think the #1 problem so far in this heist is the lack of feedback, it just spawns so many super out there theories
[8:22:11] RVIV_: DW loves to cheese man

[8:22:33] Tweker: @shuffling321 no, because the a b c change everytime.
[8:22:35] CplDarkeye: DEAN DESKCHAN
[8:22:40] KylesLowT: different codes for each section would take foreverrr
[8:22:41] esrou: Unless there is a specific order for the key pads, then that would only be 24 different ways if there is feedback
[8:22:44] The_only_arghhh: What if nothing works when the power is back on
[8:22:46] Siners: KEKW
[8:22:50] shuffling321: @Tweker that's why you spam the prompt until you get abc you want
