[5:09:48] devilman4666: how could the vagos do this?
[5:09:57] RetributionZero: Well, imo: Jenny just needs some sorta demon sword, or silver bullets or whatnot.

[5:18:06] Marty85er: Looky-loos or hobbyists is my guess haha
[5:18:17] Sirus29: Members of the Norman Bones Fan Club?
[5:19:34] nikolegrnd: Pog
[5:21:07] syned77: wtf someone climbed into a pizza oven? xD
[5:21:42] casualgeekygirl: wait who said (I'm paraphrasing) someone has the answer? did Balto say it or Norman? i wasn't paying full attn?
[5:22:05] casualgeekygirl: ahhh ty
[5:22:14] nikolegrnd: LUL
[5:23:33] Sirus29: odds on the tugboat blowing up!? PepeLaugh
[5:23:44] casualgeekygirl: jenny is like "fuck this shit im out"
[5:24:48] nikolegrnd: being friends >>>
[5:24:55] tiryanos: I wonder what kinda deal Norman would try to make jenny take
[5:25:07] Marty85er: Jenny and Copper dipping, just need the Family Friendly 4-door
[5:26:20] Marty85er: Yeah, basically "Damn, she won't be easily manipulated. Oh well, just a chat then"
[5:28:32] Marty85er: Was a lot of "I just want to hear what they say"
[5:31:05] nikolegrnd: NODDERS
[5:31:15] casualgeekygirl: truuue
[5:31:16] Marty85er: 100%
[5:31:51] thatclubdj: flop suggested sai and sounded like he wouldnt bat an eye at it
[5:31:52] Marty85er: Kinda feel like name dropping who owned the white bird wasn't the best move either
[5:32:11] ElMark998: who's mark?
[5:33:15] casualgeekygirl: @marty85er yes & no. you saw how ppl didnt wanna say something. it proved ppl werent gonna share easily
[5:33:40] MattThrower: I mean, could you imagine Pred getting a deal? he would not hesitate :D
[5:33:53] mikese365: yeah the norman bones story has only really (or really ) had a perma which was cleo
[5:34:07] RetributionZero: @MattThrower He'd also reneg on the deal, and try to kill norman LOL
[5:34:15] Marty85er: @casualgeekygirl True, but feel like pointing a big finger at someone who wasn't there was like putting out a target for anyone who wanted to offer something valuable to Norman
[5:34:35] Obi_Wan_Jabroni: norman told kyle and a few others to go fuck themselves on halloween during the event LUL
[5:35:13] casualgeekygirl: ppl also assume the consequences mean purgatory or death
[5:35:20] nikolegrnd: monkaW
[5:35:22] mikese365: @MattThrower **** is currently trying to save them 2
[5:35:28] syned77: The perma that really caught me off-guard was Winchester in 2.0. Ray had the perma condition "gunned down at a traffic stop" and it took so long to happen it almost seemed as if it never would
[5:36:27] mikese365: @MattThrower i defo only think kyle would only do a deal for jenny
[5:36:45] RetributionZero: I hadnt heard any of this norman stuff until today, so im still super confused what's happening? Norman was... a serial killer who got executed? ANd then what?
[5:36:52] RetributionZero: Became the reaper...? MAybe?
[5:37:10] casualgeekygirl: pretty much
[5:37:11] MattThrower: i meant, if Pred got told to kill someone or some illegal stuff... he would do it :D
[5:37:27] mikese365: @MattThrower likely yeah
[5:37:29] RetributionZero: Thats also True. Pred would just find someone he hated and kill him. Maybe Baas KEKW
[5:39:08] casualgeekygirl: @retributionzero reaper is one way looking at it. Only ziggy really knows "what" Norman is. Everyone else is just coming up with theories or titles to wrap their heads around it
[5:39:39] RetributionZero: okay understand.
[5:39:40] mikese365: great stream :)
[5:39:42] 07racingchris: not an has told others he's death
[5:40:00] MattThrower: i enjoyed it
[5:40:00] ProHanzee: Ty for strim !
[5:40:07] Obi_Wan_Jabroni: no worries, that was interesting to say the least
[5:40:08] RetributionZero: Thanks for Streaming! :D I hope you had fun!
[5:40:11] nikolegrnd: it was cool!
[5:40:20] mikese365: oh know
[5:40:22] rhuscher: monkaW
[5:40:26] 07racingchris: Norman autocorrect changed it to not an lol
