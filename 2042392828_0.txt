[1:31:51] BLazOR_Prime: @Westlove_ disagree, Auto's shift so much faster than manual right now
[1:31:51] Donkey__Rhubarb: pdk transmission

[1:32:16] Janizki_Fin: You should make a 59 70 and a 88 do a drag race? ask if you can upgrade more cars for testing?
[1:32:22] Westlove_: @blazor_prime faster doesn’t mean better imo

[1:32:31] not_uniq: you think peanut is just in hiding and letting others do shit for him?
[1:32:42] tobbetoto: Automaci dont gett to much effect from turbos Manuel gett much more effect from the turbos

[1:32:49] LCK_K: LULW
[1:32:52] Winttyrr: irl, manual is more fun than auto, but new auto's are significantly faster than manual. humans will never be as fast as modern computers

[2:05:21] Cthyllah: yeah it doesnt make any sense it sounds dangerous
[2:05:22] zetjex: it might be cuz he consented to the raid it was not a warrant
[2:05:22] eatcheese0: not really a raid right? its a search of a property

[2:14:37] BLazOR_Prime: @VegaGGz i dont think so, because youre not playing with a bunch of people at once, its smaller groups of people
[2:14:39] VegaGGz: @fur3x look up what MMO stands for.
[2:14:40] steven_even853: @devvastate oh damn, that sounds crazy

[2:56:01] PerronC13: break off??? what kind of snowflake PD
[2:56:01] BLazOR_Prime: @earldabster mcnaulty wouldnt either
[2:56:02] Rivath: @Kaztiell nope, maybe letting cops actually catch bad guys instead of handicapping them to farm revenue?
[2:56:02] Phfreal: cops only good at talking for 12 hours
[2:56:04] Spliphos1199: :

[2:56:12] DeoNone: I mean it will take them 50 minutes to catch them just for them to switch cars and it will keep happening over and over
[2:56:13] Wubsian: good driving Logan OKEY
[2:56:13] 2silentt: they got plate and identities so you break it off and find them later ultra realistyc

[2:56:33] CDowg1: Classic why have fun when you can have realism 󠀀
[2:56:33] Khyber_GT: liberal snowflake PD
[2:56:35] blackmar14: @PerronC13 i mean they got the plate and they can identify the suspects so they can just get a warrant
[2:56:35] Prodigy46: PD cars are so shit kekw
[2:56:37] Kaztiell: @VivaLaValle you and 2 cop streamers thought so then xd
[2:56:37] Makemepurr: Breakoff after first pit. Nice job
[2:56:40] bar10dr: Might be more realistic but its also less entertaining :D
[2:56:43] zigzagg88: Cornwood and andrews would of shot those tires out
[2:56:45] maravisz: @puppietreats mhm
[2:56:47] steven_even853: it's not that bad, guys. It was going to be very tough to win that one against those cars
[2:56:50] puppietreats: @bar10dr maybe if you’re 3
[2:56:51] condor2104: cops in IRL do call off chases if they see that it may get to dnagerous
[2:56:53] Van_1912: the crims able to ping echother on map for pickups is all complete BS
[2:56:56] iwannanuhh: dont understand the point of initiating an chase if its non violent crime since they wont stop once it starts so why even begin the chase?
[2:56:56] rickyred66: Yeah that wouldn't happen in real life. I'm a former officer I know lol
[2:56:59] eliteone11: @steven_even853 yeah but play it out
[2:57:00] MadderHatter: I've seen cops call off chases but usually they have a chopper following them
[2:57:01] Atario: is andrews still playing?
[2:57:02] Connorbrow: Need air 1 to allow for safe breaks without letting them free
[2:57:06] Smiley9998: @eliteone11 i dont think its ever a time to traeat rp like real life

[2:57:07] GFEGlory: @rickyred66 Nerdge
[2:57:07] Dream_Canceled: @eliteone11 yes; Irl cops call of chases if 1. speeds reach too high and 2. if there is heavy traffic/in a heavily populated area
[2:57:07] neft39157: true the newer pd cars  would be better on these types of chases
[2:57:07] M80_Osm: need AIR 1
[2:57:09] jacksmithcje: lets be real guys if they started to get dundee the other two cars join more it gets into a mess comms go nuts and people start shouting anyway
[2:57:09] throat_pump: it’s not even realistic though lol, cop chases have gone hours for less
[2:57:12] VivaLaValle: @VivaLaValle okay boss. fingle, mel and dundee fans beg to differ
[2:57:12] bar10dr: @puppietreats You're watching people roleplay on the internet, what are you talking about KEKW
[2:57:15] MahanGM: bobby -> dentt
[2:57:15] BlazeAndConfuse: shouldn't the other chase have been called first since that one was going longer?
[2:57:18] puppietreats: has0head wait wtf cop L there was no chase
[2:57:18] n0oxaskek: @steven_even853 it's not about winning, it's about dominating
[2:57:19] BLazOR_Prime: every time cars get pulled over then drive off, why even chase if its gonna get called off
[2:57:21] BlakeChaos: Making the report will take longer than the chase was, lol
[2:57:21] SacreDiablo: donkJam

[2:57:38] Kaztiell: @VivaLaValle im a kyle fan so I hate chases
[2:57:38] CDowg1: PAPERWORK time
[2:57:40] Golden11: @throat_pump it is realistic actually, cops will end pursuit if it becomes dangerous for the public
[2:57:41] supaiiii: i'm a real cop, we would've used stinger rockets on them Kappa

[2:58:05] Dream_Canceled: @throat_pump it is though unfortunately. I have family who are police and they have had to call if chases due to things like the car reaching speeds over 130 and it heading into a heavily populated area
[2:58:05] Sillyanne: chat be nice to each other Stare
[2:58:05] spazticbull: All I'm saying is I haven't seen one good police chase since watching 4.0, this is the most boring rp ever

[2:58:54] Cfcampbell24: am sure we'll have rocket launchers for next chase chatter lol
[2:58:54] Mortalized: HUH
[2:58:55] Flip25k: I think the rate at which police pit need to be quicker if they are going to bail on the chase all together.
[2:58:57] mattchutt: once we get that 25kill streak we’ll have that nuke
[2:58:59] MahanGM: bobby dentt
[2:59:05] shikari07: Chat just mad when the cops don't instantly pit and go for lethal
[2:59:06] VivaLaValle: 4.0 is such shit compared to all other versions, thank god for shitlording
[2:59:13] Prodigy46: LANG HAS NUKES SCHIZO
[2:59:13] Mouso9: If you has permission to pit earlier you would have had a really good chance
[2:59:16] n0oxaskek: they didnt even make an attempt to pit them :(
[2:59:20] iwannanuhh: calling of the chase may be the rigth thing but for content its a huge L
[2:59:22] maravisz: Chat RP isnt about mindless chasing playing cops & robbers all day.
[2:59:22] cuzion: Hello Forsen
[2:59:26] thegummibearmassacre: @VivaLaValle HUH
[2:59:29] judge_hat: they are only allowed to pit when the suspect's car is below 60 mph i think
[2:59:31] MahanGM: where is Archer tho Susge
[2:59:32] TheBull14597: do they ever catch someone after chases
[2:59:37] CodeEditor: 4Head
[2:59:39] 1Tesla1: the officers are doing pretty good jobs chasing with what the got. the rules from higher up are bad though
[2:59:41] supaiiii: 4Head
[2:59:42] Vallhan: If you don't like watching 4.0 then leave.
[2:59:42] bigwizardo: What are the Rules of Engagement for police? What does it take to happen before they start shooting?
[2:59:46] SirHexalon: @iwannanuhh tru
[2:59:47] Sadisticmedic: Just Chase Dundee
[2:59:51] KissMyAsthma_69: Archer Susge
[2:59:51] MadderHatter: @maravisz Yes it is, if you've ever watched a rat chase it's a thing of beauty, it's still a game
[2:59:54] puppietreats: @bar10dr cries over a chase not happening, isn’t 3
[2:59:56] n0oxaskek: @judge_hat that's exactly what liberal snowflakes would do
[3:00:04] Sadisticmedic: going it circles in motor pool KEKW
[3:00:08] MadderHatter: @maravisz The rats know the city like the back of their hands and the cops that study them, it's rp to the highest degree
[3:00:13] puppietreats: @madderhatter no it’s not
[3:00:14] Prodigy46: @bigwizardo crims need to shoot first I think
[3:00:17] MoohamedAlii: Should 've o
[3:00:20] EvilCoatrack: If they pit a cop, you end 'em
[3:00:26] Lofty916: It's always lame when it gets called off
[3:00:26] bigwizardo: If they start to pit, police should be able to BLAST THEM. A car is a DEADLY WEAPON.
[3:00:30] femboysthighs: calling off every chase just promotes people to run for every crime if they wont be pitted or punished, even if pitting officers
[3:00:31] cqmer0n_193: should've ended the other one
[3:00:32] SargentNavi: -------- }>==+
[3:00:35] BLazOR_Prime: lol ruth called off a hostage chase
[3:00:36] panhever: you need to roughup asap , start fkin blastin em mofos, cuz this is way too easy for crims
[3:00:37] CDowg1: mhm no no call off all chases it is too dangerous
[3:00:39] Vallhan: I mean if the casualties are locals LULW
[3:00:42] supaiiii: NODDERS shoot them all
[3:00:42] average_joe_64: wanna join this serverI
[3:00:44] KYslippy: crim was just trying to get home to his sick momma with the medicine he couldn't afford
[3:00:44] n0oxaskek: @EvilCoatrack the cops pit themselves KEKW
[3:00:45] kyleeeeeee_: the rain wasnt helping too
[3:00:47] TheGhostlyOnyx: @bigwizardo problem is that leads to desync being abused  and cops might just shoot
[3:00:49] Archangel3003: It might encourage them to pit more knowing that you'd back off and let them get away maybe?
[3:00:50] Thy_Panzer: if you pit an officer kill them or paralyze them awakenjj
[3:00:52] MadderHatter: @puppietreats if you can think that you haven't really watched good rp
[3:00:54] bigwizardo: @TheGhostlyOnyx A fair point
[3:00:54] BLazOR_Prime: ruth called off a hostage chse and the hostage ended up dead
[3:00:54] TheBull14597: @femboysthighs yip
[3:00:55] 1Tesla1: switch to lethal and take tires out at that point
[3:00:56] Janman88: if they start to escalate it u cant break it of?
[3:00:59] neft39157: he did do the right call but with all the rules, it's hard to make the right call if you know what I mean
[3:00:59] rickyred66: Cornwood jumped a car hit a bridge and then fell on a propane tank. But a pursuit is to dangerous lol
[3:01:02] Prodigy46: shoot all crims that go over 60mph ReallyMad
[3:01:04] MahanGM: shoot them even before that Evilge
[3:01:10] MakingMischiefs: as soon as they started ramming and putting g you guys I think you should have the authority to start being more aggressive
[3:01:10] Rebsdorf_TFT: 3.0 you could shoot them if they pitted you, in 4.0 you get a dap for keeping up the chase
[3:01:13] TheMah1337: just cause they don't catch them doesn't mean the chase wasn't good
[3:01:15] complexlalo: It’s three cars pitting that’s like a meth run chase level lmao
[3:01:16] maravisz: @MadderHatter I'm just critizing the complaints about not chasing further when they got all the information they needed. At that point it would be a pointless chase, doesnt make sense for roleplay.
[3:01:17] azmer1987: Pitting is dangerous to the locals
[3:01:19] steven_even853: I think cops should install grappling hooks to the front of their vehicles
[3:01:20] the4th_gamer: shoot tires, or anticipate and set traps
[3:01:22] neft39157: mount maxhjne guns to the cop cars
[3:01:23] bigwizardo: Police should be able to indiscriminately shoot repeat offenders
[3:01:23] afkbrb: @Rebsdorf_TFT OMEGALAUGHING
[3:01:28] TheBull14597: @BLazOR_Prime no way, did she know about the hostage?
[3:01:30] Vallhan: Crims have way to much control
[3:01:36] Cfcampbell24: where's the swat truck just ram them with that lol
[3:01:36] BLazOR_Prime: @TheBull14597 yes
[3:01:42] femboysthighs: OMEGALUL
[3:01:42] marczm4n: hard disagree
[3:01:43] Flip25k: I agree that if the robber evades for a set time they should get away. but the idea of civ safety so you don't pit doesn't hold water, if the police just bail.
[3:01:44] TheLlamaTrainer: How to evade police on FiveM? Simply drive more recklessly. The cops get scared and call it off lmao
[3:01:45] younghof27: kek music
[3:01:46] Prodigy46: @BLazOR_Prime LOL
[3:01:54] Sweet_BabyJeebus: You can pit back right?

[3:01:59] Mortalized: SCHIZO
[3:02:00] condor2104: u need mounter machine guns in front of every police car

[3:02:07] KnightyGaming: TheVoices
[3:02:07] Redtwintails: while I agree for realism it can be dangerous to follow, but crims seem to not have any fear of deat and get away with too much imo
[3:02:07] BermTri: Cop RP is just paper work
[3:02:08] judge_hat: when the pd fills up, they would stick to chases more often
[3:02:09] TheGhostlyOnyx: @MahanGM Concerned

[3:29:51] dayvklar: Clueless 🤙 CLUEEEEEEEEEEEE
[3:29:51] azmer1987: Esfand is based
[3:29:55] mrwriii: just cause ur juicer gets arrested ONCE doesnt mean that pd isnt down bad Clueless
[3:29:55] BlakeChaos: DUde, kids just robbed a bank, pitted cops and the cops just called it off. They are down bad.
[3:29:57] Dicejr7: you can still be tazering
[3:29:58] EuBeans: Its the same thing for crims... they are just as down bad lmao
[3:29:58] Pibon1: "they are going 100mph? ok we cant get them"
[3:29:58] PsychoJoker: @Mayorthis555 those were locals
[3:29:59] crowgoes: the crims have no way to make money though
[3:29:59] Spillmaker: TAKE THE SHOT CYRING
[3:30:00] SoLDiER510: Picking cuffs seems more realistic
[3:30:01] MrOfficeGuy: even xqc was talking about how pd is down bad right now
[3:30:02] JO3Y_C: Clueless HOLY
[3:30:03] DmSoldier: Im a crim fan but ya cops been handcuffed
[3:30:03] loveandsupply: cops are belong way too many rules. as a viewer we can predict what the next move would be, which is usually nothing. cornwood makes pd fun. that’s why they didn’t want you as mayor lol
[3:30:03] smalllittleisaac: shoot em all
[3:30:05] dayvklar: HOWDY KKonaW 7 America CUNGUS KKona KornKool banjoTime KKool GuitarTime KKool esfandCOPS esfandHowdy KKornwood esfandPPF KKornwood 10-41 KornKool America SHITSHOW
[3:30:06] Vikairius: The cars have been the most noticable cop problem
[3:30:07] zigzagg88: Yea hurts to watch some time cause convicts dnt have guns and hard fot u guys to judge to shoot not to shoot
[3:30:09] dayvklar: CORNMAN
[3:30:10] smalllittleisaac: like pokemons
[3:30:11] Mayorthis555: @Mayorthis555 hell they deserved it
[3:30:12] cheebah710: smokee mhm
[3:30:15] littleterp: cars suck 1. 2. ant use force PD is down bad
[3:30:17] sunmantv: I think it was fair the first few weeks, but now PD is just super nerfed compared to crim
[3:30:17] Capn_Stew: Just shooting all the time is makes for boring rp imo
[3:30:18] crowgoes: the ones up good are civs really
[3:30:18] asap_c0lt45: i love to see no guns in gta, gta online on console is just people killing each other its sooo boring
[3:30:19] abnormalu: mhm
[3:30:21] LutinV: when they are running away from you on foot, can you not love tap them with your car to make them fall over so you can arrest them?
[3:30:23] mailisforchumps: It looks really frustrating to be a cop. Just like real life
[3:30:23] jdg_kalista: Cronwood is based esfand is too forgiving and thoughtful
[3:30:24] Erratikan: what happened to spike strips
[3:30:25] blueboats12: @esfandtv what are the rules on shooting out tires
[3:30:27] Waycaps: The clowns were right! The PD needs to be able to show teethe
[3:30:27] SlimTDC: driving a car into the scene is major fail rp
[3:30:29] Vikairius: Second would be the court cases
[3:30:31] Insaneoptimus: PD needs less daps more taps
[3:30:32] Buster_Buster: is that because of the decisions of captains or is it 'outside' reasons for why PD is SO down bad
[3:30:34] Bennji95: is drive by shootings bannable?
[3:30:39] DismalShark: the most annoying part I've seen is other characters interfering with active investigations.
[3:30:39] Damnitben: Just set the scene.  Roll up, drop 3 people.  Drive away, say nothing.
[3:30:46] greenburg22: @slimtdc true
[3:30:46] Sizzlaa: just the tires yyjBloodTrail
[3:30:48] Mouso9: So you should have shot the cars pitting cops
[3:30:52] n0oxaskek: just shoot ask questions later
[3:30:55] nocherlas: you need a crim to help the PD in RP to arm themselves
[3:30:56] Marcobeste97: Yeah the internal structure itself is not good but compared to how crims situation is it's not bad imo
[3:31:01] Gallyy: seeing crims use cars to swoop in and rescue their boiis is hard to watch tho. PD never seems to be able to control a scene
[3:31:02] greenburg22: with no rp yes it’s rdm but with rp it’s good
[3:31:05] meeshAKAsketh: Depends yah
[3:31:05] Kitten_McNugget: Then how come when theyre running in a chase and swerving the pd doesnt even try to pit?
[3:31:08] sunlitebro: paperwork Pointless SmokeTime
[3:31:10] Gurch: If it's 0 RP around it it's bannable
[3:31:12] Bushwick78: depends on the situation
[3:31:14] KAERNK: Didn't cops shoot the tires on previous versions?
[3:31:14] KylianMfrappe: hire an assistant to transcribe your statements
[3:31:14] shmiitay: the plankton breakdown after mask removal yesterday ICANT
[3:31:15] Ray__C: did you see the taser damage btw? it breaks every bone in the body nearly
[3:31:17] DonnieRockettt: some situations when they try to use their cars as weapons you should be able to shoot?
[3:31:19] grimnasherr: that real rp is what it is lmao
[3:31:20] yuh_boi77: if you call before and threat i think that would be cool
[3:31:21] dallkionn: cops cant shoot crimms?
[3:31:22] freen87: @esfandtv did you find out how the heck Bonnie got locked in a closet yesterday
[3:31:23] Exotic_Soul: it depends, if its rdm then yes its bannable
[3:31:27] ArtificialHelix: What if its not a shitty RP and its just a murder's MO?
[3:31:28] Dicejr7: you should add paintball guns f
[3:31:29] bored5000: Tasers are so op rn
[3:31:30] zigzagg88: How is it shitty..you gotta catch u murdered..maybe he likes to kill in game
[3:31:30] Thraxton1: IRL if someone drives at officers on a crime scene they got magdumped real quick, I get that this is different but still...
[3:31:31] dayvklar: @StoryBookHD, WORDLE ON 6 Saved monkaOMEGA
[3:31:33] Sadisticmedic: I think it goes against server rules Drive by
[3:31:33] thegummibearmassacre: @Ray__C @EsfandTV
[3:31:34] PlaybookTV: I feel like a good RP driveby would be to deliberately miss 99% of shots, just do it for effect
[3:31:35] greenburg22: @ray__c Jesus
[3:31:36] smalllittleisaac: man, i hope that in todays episode we get an Archer and/or Andrews appearance.
[3:31:36] SmileyFaceiNchat: rp > shooting
[3:31:40] Janizki_Fin: @Ray__C thats craazyyy
[3:31:40] StoryBookHD: @dayvklar, monkaS PepeLaugh
[3:31:41] Sizzlaa: liar, liar esfandPls
[3:31:45] PsychoJoker: It was, Yall got plates of 2 cars and confirmed 2 suspects
[3:31:46] omascas: Breaking off sucks tho
[3:31:47] loveandsupply: cops are boring. the RP is too predicable. as a viewer we know you can’t do anything.
[3:31:49] marczm4n: you can’t stop a chase
[3:31:51] jonfett: Not breaking off
[3:31:51] Damnitben: @Ray__C Those batons can 1 tap like 5 people in a single swing
[3:31:53] ltl_wackman: @PlaybookTV yea guns are kinda accurate, you have a point
[3:31:54] vicious_pen: what confuses me is like......you guys can't really stop the cars.  they just slip out no matter what.
[3:31:55] Techno_Plumber: @esfandtv any coment on graycens ban?
[3:31:55] Grumplestillskin: Susge a little too perfect
[3:31:57] killaton: esfand stoned playing RP would be something to watch
[3:32:04] n0oxaskek: i dont understand why cops breaking off he pursuit after 5 minutes if they go reckless. isnt the point of a pursuit to stop reckless behaviour?
[3:32:05] spansonite1: <3
[3:32:07] microplasticbrain: I think you're ready to be a real cop
[3:32:07] rickyred66: 2 minute chase = 5 hours of paperwork
[3:32:07] Ray__C: true based take NODDERS
[3:32:09] Snackkbar: L cops Sadge
[3:32:10] MadderHatter: it's strange there's no choppers
[3:32:10] PsychoJoker: W and L Chatters Classic
[3:32:11] Ray__C: losing leads to RP
[3:32:13] dayvklar: Hmm
[3:32:16] Ibiffo: and to each other
[3:32:17] Waycaps: The big story right now is the Cornwood Landlord RP
[3:32:17] Spillmaker: if you wanna win, go play regular GTA LuL
[3:32:18] vicious_pen: you guys have them boxed in and they always slip out.  shouldn't there be a way to stop them?
[3:32:19] CaptainWilly: Story? I want moon2W bro
[3:32:19] Lizymarie: It's like Reno 911. Well. Cornwood 911.
[3:32:20] Snackkbar: ddue the shiesty ruth shit is sooooo good
[3:32:22] Dreadwolf777: retarded W and L juicers Classic
[3:32:22] Mayorthis555: @Ray__C its taser time then, maybe just one leg or somthing but damn
[3:32:24] Zarniwooper: @EsfandTV are you not using the gun crosshair for rp reasons?
[3:32:28] Sch1ey: Rp is about the moments not wins or loses
[3:32:28] Bushwick78: this isnt Apex chat
[3:32:28] Fozenoh: Remember chat they're trying to make RP not win every encounter NODDERS
[3:32:28] reaper2204: the story stacks up, build charges on crims who will keep doing crim things and it only gets bigger and bigger
[3:32:30] ActuallySupremacy: Winners are losers this aint street fight fool
[3:32:31] jonfett: On Denzel and on Cornwoof (Ruth)
[3:32:33] TimmayHS: Den deserves better (his character)
[3:32:34] Zolcix: peepoTalk
[3:32:35] Raja_Banhammer: L
[3:32:37] average_joe_64: The getaway cars coulda slowed down so it looked like an epic car chase
[3:32:37] DrWetbone: BIG story is archer the crim
[3:32:37] Capn_Stew: @Ray__C That's nuts! I feel like they should do little to no dmg.
[3:32:37] Ns38: Bring in a union to protect the employees. Have cornwood in negotiations with the captains
[3:32:39] thegummibearmassacre: @EsfandTV Tasers apparently break all their bones now D:
[3:32:40] lawlkat: @EsfandTV fun story. but if he gets fired, Deansocool could actual lose viewership because he can't cop
[3:32:40] crescenterra: sure but the crims need to take some Ls as well no?
[3:32:42] Gurch: Noone can get guns pd has to be slightly handcuffed
[3:32:44] ilmarcusil: UltraMad chase the W
[3:32:48] NautMe: i mean i love the RP between the report sessions
[3:32:52] greenburg22: police union
[3:32:54] Ray__C: @Capn_Stew yes, tasers nearly kill you
[3:32:54] DonnieRockettt: Ruth is on Shiesty and Cornwood pityscNod
[3:32:55] Fozenoh: xqcL ?

[3:33:07] Waycaps: xqcL
[3:33:08] B__M__C: I LOVE the drama and RP that comes through, but on some level I still want to see the cops catch a criminal once in a while
[3:33:09] Spliphos1199: finish the report HDMI
[3:33:09] KylianMfrappe: +1 dap for that statement
[3:33:09] Janman88: i only know myth
[3:33:10] TimmayHS: I don't shit on him for his RP, I shit on him for his IRL.

[3:33:20] dayvklar: KKonaW GUN
[3:33:21] capitanseven: Yeah that is some bullshit. Remember when Jason came so cops could help him? They couldn't do anything. They honestly only good to arrest people who robbing locals
[3:33:21] loveandsupply: cornwood makes PD fun, without you it feels like going to an actual job and not RP. that’s why PD didnt want cornwood as mayor so soon.
[3:33:22] underwaterlurker: the best characters take plenty of L's RP>PVP
[3:33:23] average_joe_64: no idea

[3:33:36] AngeloJulius: peepoHappy i love xqc
[3:33:38] OminousEinherjar: He has become a lot better
[3:33:41] dayvklar: @AngeloJulius, xqcL
[3:33:42] average_joe_64: is XQc a person?
[3:33:44] Marcobeste97: Yeah situations always end up ending in nothing and it's pretty boring
[3:33:47] whereisgravel: xqc got me INTO rp
[3:33:49] ltl_wackman: oh yea that was actually interesting
[3:33:49] CrystalDimension: New Interceptors for 4.0 Pog https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYEnFNttQcw
[3:33:49] microplasticbrain: the problem with xqc is you always know its xqc
[3:33:50] TheGhostlyOnyx: it was funny as hell and good rp
[3:33:50] Janman88: X knows how to drive forward a story yes
[3:33:51] stonedfrosted: yeah he made 10x more rp
[3:33:52] squiderp_: real
[3:33:53] loveandsupply: xqc too OP to hate on
[3:33:55] SMStephanie: that was myth though
[3:33:56] meeshAKAsketh: He has gotten better I agree
[3:33:58] Waycaps: FirstTimeChatter
[3:33:58] afkbrb: NGL he's RPing better this time around than 3.0
[3:33:59] SwaggWaggon: X is a very good RPer
[3:34:00] azmer1987: That's why deleted tho. No evidence so early to base server law precedent
[3:34:05] Brundeen: FirstTimeChatter
[3:34:06] thegummibearmassacre: The worst part about Xqc is his viewers. Hes entertaining.
[3:34:06] soul00001: And the outcome was?
[3:34:06] TimmayHS: I agree, Myth is super good at RP
[3:34:14] dayvklar: forsenhobo
[3:34:16] chill_muffin19: TRUE
[3:34:16] AngeloJulius: he generates tons of drama
[3:34:17] dayvklar: peepoGiggles
[3:34:20] samaelulu: Classic Myth
[3:34:20] YaBoyNoskii: Agreed, that was a great watch and the judge was awesome
[3:34:23] moe_ron: @SwaggWaggon u mean myth, right? LUL

[3:34:37] Thraxton1: the problem with JP is not even xqc, it's that there's always like 10 orbiters and cloutchasers that are always ready to help him whenever he gets in trouble. JP's shitlording is funny on its own
[3:34:38] aimsbadsoirun: that was amazing to watch
[3:34:39] wavy__________________: with positive GSR
[3:34:42] NoMahney: What happened with that scenario? I can't keep up with all these characters?
[3:34:43] Marcobeste97: Yeah that rp about the judge and the gun was pretty good
[3:34:48] azmer1987: It is back in the docke
[3:34:50] TheMah1337: That chase with XQC a long time ago where Cornwood and Andrews cuffed eachother was hilarious
[3:34:50] Eeyley: if you make a crim do you want to hang around little texas or the city?
[3:34:51] marczm4n: why did the judge get perma’d?
[3:34:53] jonfett: Shame the judge thing rp got forgotten
[3:34:55] greenburg22: my fav was when 4 ppl found him in the middle of the open ocean in a row the other day
[3:34:56] YaBoyNoskii: the judge was great about it
[3:34:56] Raja_Banhammer: To be fair you have to have a very high IQ to understand... esfandExplaining
[3:35:02] mattchutt: all the rp this 4.0 has been so amazing
[3:35:04] afkbrb: @marczm4n he's not?
[3:35:07] Janizki_Fin: The report poofed
[3:35:07] evilmoose__: The Clowns winning RP wars right now.
[3:35:11] Janizki_Fin: MDT bugged out
[3:35:13] thegummibearmassacre: @EsfandTV Ray said tasers break all your bones now D:
[3:35:14] AivHell: report got scuffed
[3:35:16] Marcobeste97: That was a really good a idea that could have ended up with a nice law change
[3:35:19] azmer1987: PepeLaugh things happened to with that case lol
[3:35:19] TimmayHS: JP does seem kinda untouchable with all the help, but it's funny as shit
[3:35:20] Rangless: Do you like BoggDans level of RP? or is it too silly? @EsfandTV
[3:35:21] marczm4n: no the streamer
[3:35:22] CodeForTea: suspended with pay
[3:35:26] Im_Creativ: whyd he get suspended
[3:35:26] dayvklar: hmjj
[3:35:28] hannah_grace0823: what about the Rat King situation?!?
[3:35:28] marczm4n: not the judge
[3:35:28] Janizki_Fin: Report dissapeared from the m d t
[3:35:33] sp0rkehNW: xqcL I agree myth is the greatest esports RP player of all time
[3:35:35] Im_Creativ: no
[3:35:39] Acrael: was he a good judge or kinda meh?
[3:35:39] offbrand: does bobby have painted fingernails?
[3:35:40] zigzagg88: I have seen other cities that are poppin..you would be good else where cause u are good at your job and game and a cop
[3:35:41] JazzPimp: murphys been down bad between xqc and moonmoon
[3:35:41] Capn_Stew: He does have a ton of "interns"
[3:35:41] Bushwick78: funny??
[3:35:41] TheGhostlyOnyx: OMEGALUL
[3:35:43] tak0g0dz: moon2Y TOOK MURPHYS GIRL
[3:35:43] Im_Creativ: he is not untouchable
[3:35:43] Sizzlaa: lol
[3:35:43] Mouso9: The big problem I see is there's no benefit for victims.  They just except it and move on knowing the same people can rob them again tomorrow
[3:35:44] maravisz: xQc has actually been disliking the behavior his own chat recently because they still cant understand its RP.
[3:35:46] vicious_pen: Okay but at the same time.  I think people try to serve the RP too much.  Treat it like it's the Prime thing of import, and it's not.    It shouldn't be.  People should matter. and there are times where the people pay the cost for the RP.  Sayinng you lose if you can't roll with it.  I don't feel is responsible or fair
[3:35:51] Hiatuz: Jean paul shot 2 people infront of cops the other day. Yeah hes kinda untouchable
[3:35:52] Sizzlaa: knxHIT jokrdAmeno
[3:35:55] Alkemiee: he is untouchable
[3:35:55] Kota216: I did watch him ask for a ride, car was full. 3 peopole jumped out and said ill walk you can go. THAT would nto happen to reg joe lol
[3:35:55] Marts1: he iis creating alot of RP atm I feel, many scenarios
[3:35:59] Vikairius: I think once there are enough cops and the captains don't have to train as much, PD and cases will get handled much faster
[3:36:02] Sch1ey: Real gang leaders are kknd of the same tho
[3:36:03] Marcobeste97: Why untouchable, he gets his ass handed to him a bunch of times
[3:36:04] ilmarcusil: Chatting
[3:36:05] Janman88: within the RP there is no actual reason why everybody sticks with the most crazy person in the city LUL
[3:36:06] distracted_24_7: He got that plot armor
[3:36:08] ilmarcusil: hackerCD
[3:36:08] timtheboneman: big streamers always get benefits, cornwood gets less daps (after that first barrage) bc in the back of their mind they don't want to lose 30k eyeballs on the PD
[3:36:09] Dicejr7: real Police RP should be modeled by "Team America"
[3:36:12] Rangless: Do you like BoggDans level of RP? or is it too silly? a lot of cops just shut him down straiight away @EsfandTV
[3:36:20] TimmayHS: @maravisz KEKW shocking
[3:36:20] greenburg22: when ray and x shot up jasons house they slowly walked to their car when the cops actively pulled up on scene lmao
[3:36:22] dayvklar: SHITSHOW
[3:36:25] justgam3ing: one badass in the city that always seems to get away is cool for rp
[3:36:25] itisacar: the way cornwood reads and writes his reports warms my heart
[3:36:25] omascas: I have my issues with xQc but him has JP it's a good job. It's funny to see both streams when there's issues because it's literally you and xqc arguing with chatters trying to pit you against each other, while you explain the scenario and irl friendship
[3:36:25] Sizzlaa: shibuy4Aqua
[3:36:27] Im_Creativ: jean paul might be the main character, but he's not immune
[3:36:31] damroyalty: xqc has a entourage of help, just like in WoW
[3:36:31] 1CaptainRedBeard1: I do think the PD is at a point where the fines need to be more punishing to the crims to actually "prevent crime." People are legit not caring about the cost at all anymore - prime example being Dex the yesterday.
[3:36:33] Zolcix: Chatting

[6:12:17] taraannee: @drewtly i was jokingly talking abt osvaldo bc the lawyer said “he did what he was legally obligated to” which is false LUL but esfand has said no, it’s too much for a pd officer to also be w crime

[6:12:21] Drewtly: @HashtagSoBlessed i play on nopixel blue and i swear i see dirty cops

[6:12:25] MackPlays: @Wandering_Ranger oh yeah? name them all
[6:12:26] Collectormat: true

[6:12:37] DatDudeLARKIN: What was the event? I missed it.
[6:12:38] Kelborn: hes holding an event on train tracks, there is no way this guy is serious
[6:12:40] Ferozius: EMS must be present before starting
[6:12:40] Real23Phil: he can't predict EMS won't be busy
[6:12:46] Vlasvilneous: Reckless endagerment doesnt count if you have a signed "I agree to be recklessly endagered. LUL
[6:12:48] Van_1912: dont do the event at all...wtf?
[6:12:48] Brakon: Sounds like there is not a proper process for organizing events also
[6:12:50] Smapdi_Flaffermann: Is there a non-Reckless Engangerment?  Reckful Endangerment, maybe?
[6:12:50] Freddiepines: hi, we're going to all shoot guns at each other but we told EMS WICKED
[6:12:53] Drewtly: @taraannee that makes sense to me, cornwood is a great cop PD would fall apart if he became dirty
[6:12:55] mukiwa18: you can't go do something reckless even though you told someone you are going to do it LOL
[6:12:55] BigBlue31: this would be an interesting trial
[6:12:57] doc_jade: its reckless because they were in an unsafe environment
[6:13:01] DFresh015: how can it be reckless when, what else are you supposed to do
[6:13:01] suzzanne___: free james he can't help himself he is no danger sajjbutluvv
[6:13:02] Ancor_: It's not an official event and EMS could have other calls
[6:13:03] xxlonegunmanxx: This is a Trial case
[6:13:06] Ricanelite: this is a yuckey situation
[6:13:08] HashtagSoBlessed: @drewtly Hmm maybe they just enforce it stricter on this server. Wasn’t allowed in 3.0 at least but it’s kind of a gray area
[6:13:13] doesvoodoo: HUH
[6:13:18] contentcory: is there not a DA or ADA to help with this?
[6:13:20] nabstonekido: Is ems supposed to follow them everywhere
[6:13:25] DFresh015: he is
[6:13:30] Grilbur: No shot he's right

[6:13:36] Real23Phil: no shot
[6:13:36] ltl_wackman: Susge archer
[6:13:38] taraannee: calling in a bomb threat before dropping a bomb wouldn’t be “doing duediligence beforehand” LUL what bs argument is that
[6:13:39] Van_1912: no way
[6:13:45] BarcaSants: Did the victims sign a liability waiver????
[6:13:47] Ricanelite: cops have a big pickle in there hands here
[6:13:48] Rockshock: Event organizer is most deff accountable for anything that happens during their event no matter what
[6:13:50] dudemanbroo: law isnt generally right or wrong, its about who can argue their case better.
[6:13:53] Van_1912: im gonna shoot someone.  but i called the ambulance first.  its OK!
[6:14:02] dilatata: making charges stick is the most infuriating thing irl
[6:14:02] suzzanne___: james has dementia
[6:14:05] Vikairius: This needs to go to bench imo
[6:14:14] Drewtly: @HashtagSoBlessed that would be a valid point, but im pretty certain the rules are the same for each server- and i think what you laid out is probably the valid rule
[6:14:14] WeijiBeng: Justice for Danny Zellen Shiesty
[6:14:19] Grilbur: Holding an event on active train tracks is showing disregard
[6:14:20] KYslippy: lawyer spun em LUL
[6:14:20] Ancor_: You can't just call EMS as an excuse
[6:14:21] taraannee: he did by continuing to do it despite stating it caused harm
[6:14:24] mukiwa18: but can he prove that?
[6:14:30] bigpoints101: Is there an EMS report?
[6:14:35] possibly_ed: @Grilbur literally this
[6:14:42] sholland: Did he pay the EMS wages while the event was going on? The city is not responsible for those wages on events
[6:14:44] puppietreats: OMEGALUL
[6:14:46] Real23Phil: they are emergency services, they might be busy
[6:14:50] JikaQc: So EMS and Cop knew before the event
[6:14:52] derkyturkey: ufc knows people gonna get hurt LUL
[6:14:57] derkyturkey: and they invite people
[6:14:58] MackPlays: @EsfandTV was the event in a safe place?
[6:14:59] humanhere2: he didn't have to host this event...
[6:15:04] Wandering_Ranger: did he continue regardless of if ems attended?
[6:15:21] doc_jade: it doesnt matter if he did that, its still putting on an event that puts others lives in danger
[6:15:23] Grilbur: If he called the train company and got it stopped then sure, but just getting medical ready for after is not enough
[6:15:26] KYslippy: that makes ems crims
[6:15:27] the_bucket_plays: james shouldnt get away with anything he has been hiding behind his characters age for way to long
[6:15:28] Vikairius: UFC is a sanctioned business
[6:15:29] realitywolfdog: Jay Walking
[6:15:29] xZiggyTV: jaywalkin lol
[6:15:37] Vikairius: Not casual citizens
[6:15:38] ox1muspr1me: felony jaywalk
[6:15:39] Sxe_Ben: the event being dangerous is what makes it reckless imo, this would be great to see in trial
[6:15:39] CARPExxDiem: Classic jaywalking
[6:15:40] HashtagSoBlessed: @drewtly True, and there can be cops that regularly break the law (Cornwood) but aren’t technically dirty. Just play on the edge a bit
[6:15:41] flappyskin: slap him with jaywalking
[6:15:42] Ancor_: It's not an official event and EMS could be busy
[6:15:50] Mouso9: James said that Oswald was the one who told him to call in the bomb threat.  No way to prove but interesting other angle
[6:15:51] puppietreats: @the_bucket_plays it’s not that serious
[6:15:53] DatDudeLARKIN: "People will definitely die from this... but I called for a doctor to come sit on the side so he can maybe save one, so it's all good."
[6:15:54] Flatline_: he doesn't own the train station, he doesn't have the right to set that up
[6:15:59] Rebsdorf_TFT: Failure to use blinkers
[6:16:07] realitywolfdog: Drop everything if they are willing to plead guilty to Jay walking
[6:16:11] taraannee: no way he’s getting off w just jaywalking…
[6:16:13] BeaverCiv: and Jaywalking is a gateway to terrorism of course
[6:16:18] floppyjimmiesnumber1hater: Breathing funny 10 year minimum
[6:16:20] Grilbur: And they wonder why people think the pd don't do anything

[6:16:32] Faedrik: @BeaverCiv Taroism, yes.
[6:16:33] realitywolfdog: @taraannee yes, just Jay walking
[6:16:35] doc_jade: dude push this charge, he put on an event on the train tracks, no matter what other precautions he takes, its reckless
[6:16:41] puppietreats: OMEGALUL chat actually  mad over james randal

I don't think they'll fire anyone who's actually trying to RP as a good cop.  But for like corruption, or not actually putting in the effort to learn cop RP could lead to firing.  But I don't know for sure.

[7:48:18] emery_steele: throwing someone off a roof is attempted murder

[7:48:42] classytaco_: did he shoot someone
[7:48:44] jessielight: Is it because of daps? Is that effecting decisions?
[7:48:44] Brisk_Avocado: @JonnyVulture thats when tasers come out
[7:48:45] BusterAces: nightstick for someone throwing an officer off a building sounds crazy that should warrant gun
[7:48:48] RoninSisu: @Bigrussianshrek I see
[7:48:50] KYslippy: Only time Cornwood yells is when you do "good shit" like Duncan running over a crim at lethal speeds

[7:49:01] TheMah1337: archer being nice to a criminal
[7:49:02] Icestruggler: they knew there were more ppl on the roof but never said that on radio which is a bad
[7:49:02] CaribbeanWolf: who’s writing the sops anyway
[7:49:04] Grilbur: @sillyanne he did that because its an order from a senior officer, he'll debrief after
[7:49:06] BackStageDoor: get back into the RP

[7:49:25] 1FusterCluck1: @palewhiteshadow Classic
[7:49:28] Kalious78: Gi ingredients the order doesn't mean you should take an unclear shot where you don't know what or who your aiming at
[7:49:31] ArdentCause: @k9_goliath hasn't been discussed yet
[7:49:32] Allegiance86: Guns were called because he made a bomb threat and he's resisting arrest. They can't assume he's not strapped with a bomb at that point.

[8:23:46] HistoriesPiston: These Disciplinary Action Points do not promote positive reinforcement. Instead, they instill fear of the DAP itself rather than focusing on its intended purpose of fostering long-term improvement.

[9:04:43] PewbesSalad: andrews is a legend
[9:04:43] NasrulAshr: Andrews slacking doing real job instead of RPing

[9:05:01] ArdentCause: When andrews went full IRL cop I was like holy crap
[9:05:01] jinnytolls: The PD lacks positive reinforcement for good work, everyone is stretched thin and learning opportunities dont exist when officers make mistakes. Its so easy to make a mistake as a cop and how you just talked through things real quick is so simple and avoided Daps for everyone @EsfandTV
[9:05:02] nmps_second_born: @brimstonegusher HUH
[9:05:04] Drewtly: @itsdubbz710 any idea who it was in 3.0?

[9:06:08] Drewtly: @MrActivated like honestly
[9:06:10] brimstonegusher: @brimstonegusher I copypasta things I see in chat during streams for later use Evilge
[9:06:11] s0ggybreads: Susge missing Archer
[9:06:11] 1CaptainRedBeard1: Drama is good for RP. But I think this is going to lead into some problems.
[9:06:11] smokeweedeverydad: Ah K gotcha Nodders
[9:06:12] Sweet_BabyJeebus: it is GTA after all
[9:06:12] Krovix: at that point, play a simulation game, not gta rp
[9:06:12] ilmarcusil: ReallyMad RP IS REAL LIFE
[9:06:13] im_ryebo: yes, its a game at the end of the day
[9:06:13] phaden_: @kasded YEP
[9:06:14] ArdentCause: I think the reason they are being so strict and driving that foundation and fundamentals is because they dont want the same ending as 3.0
[9:06:15] MothyNZ: GTA 6 RP is going to be wild
[9:06:15] WildWolfX: needs more Reno 911 KEKW
[9:06:15] Gallyy: crims are able to do that but pd can't
[9:06:16] Noice_Noicee: its like a live GTA sitcom as it is now it's great
[9:06:17] s0stin: if i wanted real cops tho ide watch COPS. im here to watch pretend cops shoot old men down for no good reason because its hillarious
[9:06:17] cheebah710: mhm
[9:06:18] Westlove_: sometimes if feels like people are trying to hard to make it cop simulator and not fun RP
[9:06:18] SavageTarzan: peepoComfy I've just been watching chat get so feisty and that's entertaining for me
[9:06:23] magnets_: YEP
[9:06:25] MacVane: yeah its stressing me out and i'm just watching
[9:06:25] Alphawins: why is the pressure there?
[9:06:26] AeionZen: if it becomes too real, it will be uncomfortable and stressful...like real life is lol
[9:06:26] MacVane: I hate it
[9:06:27] PrimaPally: i think there is just entirely too much red tape to deal with considering this is a game and it's supposed to be fun and wacky and crazy @EsfandTV \
[9:06:27] zyzzzo: it's becoming cringe
[9:06:27] nanitheheck: if we're going off of gta, the cops in gta shoot if you look at them wrong
[9:06:29] Astral_Rage: its just too much
[9:06:29] Caeros: @jinnytolls i think it was the compliments corn gave, slacks isn't appreaciated enough LuL
[9:06:29] PewbesSalad: ya andrews as cheif would be cool but idk if he would have the time
[9:06:29] BLazOR_Prime: its changing from RP to simulation
[9:06:30] party_buffalo_: let me be chat for a moment #ITS FUCKING REAL"
[9:06:30] Fusegate: When Dean can't sleep because he's worried his character is getting fired then its going too far
[9:06:31] LeZenon: agree
[9:06:31] OO7MI6: esfandL
[9:06:31] ZuldeadTV: i think you need to have some boundaries but at this point everything is just daps and daps
[9:06:32] Logyxxx: This is starting to feel more like a soap opera than a satire
[9:06:34] arcticbearx: i feel like there is a lot of stress in the PD
[9:06:34] sendemup: its such a deterrence
[9:06:35] 1CaptainRedBeard1: @MacVane That's how I feel.
[9:06:36] DrDoomie: Seeing Andrews character development from when he first met Cornwood to now has been amazing
[9:06:36] MahanGM: nopixel has always been like that, some people want serious rp and some want fun rp
[9:06:37] nmps_second_born: @brimstonegusher you evil bastard nmpLUL
[9:06:37] infintitedream: it’s gonna burn people out
[9:06:37] FaramirRat: Its getting over-bearing
[9:06:37] Jayaos: they're gimped
[9:06:37] Brakon: seems they are over compensating for 3.0 mistakes
[9:06:38] Afterman_: it shouldnt rid the game of the fun of  it
[9:06:39] salty__dawg: the fun
[9:06:39] Aelgagar123: I do think andrews did a really good job in 3.0 of setting the bar for what's too shitlordy and what is too serious
[9:06:39] SpungoWungo: its kinda hurting the rp
[9:06:40] Jrey000: Daps are just bad LULW they need to come up with a new discipline system
[9:06:40] kcinna: waiting
[9:06:41] slatt5: Disciplinary Caricature Points Sadge
[9:06:41] ITZxJeff: the rp
[9:06:42] JO3Y_C: Its overtaking the fun of RP and the game
[9:06:42] ZachFromChat: Thats what makes the DAP system so lame. it threatens your RP and your entire character
[9:06:42] aniki_math: the RP
[9:06:42] Shaphilly_: its gonna bring down the RP, people are gonna start to get tired of the stress
[9:06:42] Icesevage: so tense to be a cop
[9:06:43] doc_jade: it kills the rp
[9:06:43] s1cKNation: Andrews needs to fix the PD
[9:06:45] offbrand: denzel is a perfect example
[9:06:45] hyotee: the rp
[9:06:45] hereforff9: i just feel like im always waiting for something to happen
[9:06:46] The_Endymion: Overtaking fun
[9:06:47] MrDher: Andrews is a FTO IRL and Coughlin is a LEO IRL
[9:06:47] limerick2018: If that was Ruth let’s be honest your fired
[9:06:47] MacVane: killing RP
[9:06:48] aniquilattion: @blazor_prime fr

[9:06:50] iwannanuhh: Like dean
[9:06:50] smpies: its kill rp
[9:06:50] albakrut: @EsfandTV Too much seriousness and not enough freedom for character development
[9:06:51] shin5sato3: it's getting borderline too serious
[9:06:53] Utschig: Sadge PD too serious
[9:06:53] yeti_machette: ultimately it’s a video game. it’s supposed to be fun
[9:06:53] Scarecro0w: Pause
[9:06:54] BLazOR_Prime: this aint police simulation, its RP
[9:06:54] Haleos_x: people are just gonna stop playing
[9:06:55] killaton: heres 7 daps and a promotion and 1 more your fired lol
[9:06:55] Afterman_: it should ALWAYS be fun first
[9:06:56] ArdentCause: Entertainment is being hindered due to that
[9:06:57] magnets_: you can tell the admins have cracked down on the seriousness of the pd after all the complaints from 3.0 @EsfandTV
[9:06:57] imtooepic7676: Its over shadow of the whole fun and people lose it
[9:06:57] nocherlas: people are definitely getting affected in real life by the RP lol
[9:06:57] Switchblade142: It's expecting people to be have like real cops in a video game, it's just a huge ask for a lot of people playing a game
[9:06:58] Westlove_: this shouldn’t be so serious imo
[9:06:58] King0fKhaos: yeah den.. for sure
[9:06:58] RicoLoco52: the cop punishments seem to be very unbalanced next to the crim punishments
[9:06:59] BigBlue31: its too serious for sure
[9:06:59] OminousEinherjar: Seems like some are
[9:06:59] brimstonegusher: @brimstonegusher some of this shit is absolutely foul KEKW
[9:06:59] vicious_pen: That is exactly what is happening
[9:06:59] MacVane: Literally stressed right now

[9:07:00] mackyc00l: it is not being fun
[9:07:00] aniki_math: it's already happening.
[9:07:00] s0ggybreads: DAP's are a little to much for a game so not be as serious
[9:07:01] Drewtly: youre handling it really well tbh dude ive seen you stress in some games and over chat but youre a champ through this
[9:07:01] HashtagSoBlessed: RP shouldn’t be frustrating or stressful
[9:07:01] gonkfan: Positive reinforcement type beat
[9:07:02] 1CaptainRedBeard1: Dean was absurdly stressed. Poor dude.
[9:07:02] CrystalDimension: they do. It ruing RP for others
[9:07:02] joewelch29: @esfandtv dean has been getting stressed irl
[9:07:02] phaden_: It was really interesting at first but now we need stuff to be fixed, or heading that direction. Feels like the same drama again and again.
[9:07:03] laaazylemon: slacks does not understand that DAP punishment does not work the way he wants it to work.
[9:07:03] wooltrees: is it like this everytime with the PD or is this unique to 4.0?
[9:07:03] Hypersteed: Paid reactor actors xqcHead
[9:07:04] JakeStratic: They handled the growing pressure by reprimanding, doubting, and threatening more daps. Literally after that entire talk Slack threatened a dap if you talk to him :( @EsfandTV
[9:07:04] Acheron13: New pd?
[9:07:04] kasded: Sadge
[9:07:05] Leafyerick: Dean Anxiety Points Sadeg

[9:07:06] yuzurerror: daps almost make it feel competitive
[9:07:07] MahanGM: yeh Sadge
[9:07:07] belgianswaffel: dean was saying that
[9:07:07] izahkiel: It's overtaking the aspect of RP and the fun RP is supposed to follow through
[9:07:07] MacVane: its not fun at all to watch
[9:07:08] AngeloJulius: Sadge
[9:07:10] Stromie00: not fun
[9:07:11] TheKingOfWit: I think Denzel might, he talks about DAPs OOC and it's like half his stream sometimes
[9:07:12] party_buffalo_: u lose 2k viewers
[9:07:12] ChocolateMassage: just play ali
[9:07:13] KYslippy: the weight of irl logic for some things and not others is frustrating for sure
[9:07:13] NotoriousEss: Sadge
[9:07:13] ImStuckInATreeDud: damn liberal pd KKonaW
[9:07:14] Fusegate: It absolutely is getting that way for Dean
[9:07:14] bertacharm: after the meeting today dean said he could finally sleep tonight
[9:07:15] jakob125: Sadge
[9:07:16] chivvyy: that just means ppl are getting over invested
[9:07:16] R0Rty_: denzel definitely does get irl stressed
[9:07:16] NoBananaSuits: i knew it was RP but I was still getting stressed over the Denzel situation today lol
[9:07:16] MaddPursuit: yeh Sadge
[9:07:17] kylef_: yeah it's not fun for the streamer or the viewers
[9:07:17] SpungoWungo: it gets too serious
[9:07:17] williamwildcat: definitely. the cops are being harder on other cops than crims are with like. 150k licks and backstabbings.
[9:07:17] crunchwastaken: @joewelch29 it showed in his latest stream
[9:07:18] PacGamer: The IRL days for DAPs would stop me from ever playing this
[9:07:18] cbillaz: Same with Moon
[9:07:19] Xen_Crypt: it does feel like more and more of the RP is PD with other PD, rather than with everyone else
[9:07:19] ZachFromChat: Thats what makes the DAP system so lame. it threatens your RP and your entire character
[9:07:19] ChaoticSanity: it may be role play but you're role playing real life situations often
[9:07:20] xblasphemye: im not gonna lie, some of these interactions stress me out
[9:07:21] xDeadxRabbitx: dean is definitely getting stressed on stream about these daps
[9:07:22] kiolkjm: meeting with max to get laso going faster is needed to save denzel lol
[9:07:22] Cthyllah: i think everyone needs to remember this a video game, and a show, and it should still be fun, and entertaining, not lame and draining
[9:07:22] capitanseven: Yeah RP could get like that
[9:07:23] StreamElements: Join Esfand's discord! https://www.discord.gg/esfandtv

[9:07:24] charminherman: It's like they're trying to be an example of what they think actual police should be like
[9:07:24] kikisocial: the serious RP is a little off though because the DAP system IRL would have already set off a ton of HR alarms
[9:07:24] decentenuff: Yeah and no one's gunna be on the PD in a month of this shit continues
[9:07:25] Ruttiger64: damn shelly

[9:07:28] crunchwastaken: literally being wayyy to stressed
[9:07:30] science_envisions: well now you can switch to another charater
[9:07:30] GottaJhett: not that they’d care, but none of the viewers like daps at all
[9:07:31] Sweet_BabyJeebus: it feels like cops take it way more serious than the crims
[9:07:32] Scoo73r: Dean is stressed. I feel like someone needs to talk to him IRL. I though part of RP was making sure it was fun or at least not painful for everyone involved.
[9:07:32] Claxman2000: dean is IRL stressed out of his mind
[9:07:32] itisacar: im not gonna say shit, other than there is a whole storm brewing

[9:07:37] Deadguypov: that’s why moon plays dab over Lenny
[9:07:37] sniipps: exactly
[9:07:38] CrystalDimension: @EsfandTV PD  should have ppl who go ONLY to court cases for PD
[9:07:38] AngeloJulius: liberals will ruin every good thing
[9:07:38] xblasphemye: the RP is kinda too real, and its kinda not cool how some of these people are
[9:07:38] MacVane: it makes chat act weird it makes streamers change their character in RP
[9:07:38] vicious_pen: RP isn't supposed to be this intense on people
[9:07:38] Rivath: It's insane that they want cops to hardcore RP the job while everyone else just messes around
[9:07:38] Orbilion: YEP
[9:07:39] killaton: 5 of 20 characters jeez esfand what you been up too off stream

[9:07:41] Vikarious_X: Thing blue line between RP and LARPing
[9:07:44] pyromaniac_vv: So much realism, and rules, with long reports, takes away from the funny moments
[9:07:44] MacVane: its ruining the fricking fun
[9:07:44] Drewtly: your ability to RP through it and laugh it off is amazing, way too many POVs of people just mad
[9:07:45] k1nneDECIR: <3
[9:07:47] OskisOG: Susge
[9:07:47] MrActivated: Are there any real criminals that play RP ? omE
[9:07:48] ZilzGaming: i think its crazy its so strict and they think it'll become more laxed over time when most laws and stuff become more strict over time
[9:07:49] Westlove_: I agree that it’s starting to lose its appeal and fun. watching crimes is often a lot better.
[9:07:49] YEP46: YEP

Its so easy to make a mistake as a cop and how you just talked through things real quick is so simple and avoided Daps for everyone @EsfandTV
[9:10:47] arcticbearx: maybe there should be an ooc talk?
[9:10:47] bertacharm: after the meeting today dean said he could finally sleep tonight

[9:10:47] azmer1987: Daos are fake. Only your rp will get you fired
[9:10:48] ecstasy_1000: there are too many daps.. that just get rebuffed easily
[9:10:48] Jrey000: I think what might happen is they will move to Onyxmaybe

[9:10:51] ozieman3o5: GOOD STREAMERS CAN MAKE ANYTHING THEY DO ENTERTAINING TO WATCH
[9:10:51] salvoneth: can you make another cop?
[9:10:51] TodBobertson: Why do people keep saying "washed cash"? What does it mean?
[9:10:51] leviathan297: But if they get fired they could still continue the RP in some way
[9:10:52] Phunbaba: tbf ur really fun to watch as cornwood but i would just as happily watch you as ali ur just funny
[9:10:52] Gachiguru: EONS OF DAPS

[9:11:07] ArdentCause: I see it that was as a viewer - sure you get a day off but its still crappy. It's one day of you not being there for your community because of rulesets that are created against entertainment
[9:11:09] DJGUNDAM_: you don't need to be avg 100 viewer stream to do it full time either small sub 100 viewer streamers got some good communities

[9:11:11] williamwildcat: the system should be more grace until the proper tools are in place, not less grace because here are no tools.
[9:11:12] charminherman: Once the sheriff department becomes a thing honestly all the RP with be gone from the city
[9:11:14] BigBlue31: OMEGALUL

[9:11:21] Wild_Shiny_Absol: LULE
[9:11:22] Folterun: LUL not enough cops to fire ppl
[9:11:26] ilmarcusil: Dean seemed stressed Hmm

[9:11:56] doggensteinn: @TheLadyCupcake good point
[9:11:56] mensrea123: pd vs criminal = worse punishment and no due process
[9:11:56] RicoLoco52: archer doing Susge med deals
[9:11:57] Rascal_PM: loses sponsorships if he loses viewership
[9:12:01] azmer1987: Daps are literal RP you'll get fired if server rule break or terrible RPbothereise Daps are literal content makers
[9:12:03] Hysp0: Archer Birthday Susge

[9:12:11] MrDher: Susge
[9:12:12] condor2104: Archer's Bday?
[9:12:12] party_buffalo_: thanks for the you tube subscription
[9:12:14] Astral_Rage: an OOC conversation needs to be had about this stuff
[9:12:15] Smishhh: small streamers have less of a buffer to fluctuations, could potentially not be able to pay bills or something
[9:12:15] smpies: true\
[9:12:15] Leafyerick: Susge
[9:12:16] s0ggybreads: Susge trading of medical supplies
[9:12:17] ZilzGaming: those 100 viewers prolly just watching for teh PD RP
[9:12:17] Switchblade142: Yeah and even for the bigger streamers they get so much exposure by interactions with them that they won't be getting otherwise.
[9:12:18] Lite_Ice: fr
[9:12:19] SumDee_LumDee: Susge why would she be in trouble
[9:12:20] Peppermint_Wizard: @EsfandTV I'm glad you're talking about this because people are quick to say 'its just RP' but it's getting a bit stressful especially on deans stream
[9:12:20] vicious_pen: RP just shouldn't be this stressful and intense on people.  This is not REAL police
[9:12:22] Tenhalla: Susge
[9:12:23] WildWolfX: Susge
[9:12:25] minich4rmander: yea it should not be that easy for characters like ruth to dap people for like very small mistakes. she clearly abuses it and the problems that creates irl is too much
[9:12:27] xDeadxRabbitx: yall need a union
[9:12:28] phaden_: Did the ooc meeting not address any of this @EsfandTV ?
[9:12:28] Pee_aRe: Kit is always in trouble
[9:12:28] the_bud_spud: need a police union
[9:12:28] jinnytolls: The PD lacks positive reinforcement for good work, everyone is stretched thin and learning opportunities dont exist when officers make mistakes. Its so easy to make a mistake as a cop and how you just talked through things real quick is so simple and avoided Daps for everyone @EsfandTV  󠀀
[9:12:29] bliffy___: Susge where did she go
[9:12:29] Rivath: Archer super Susge
[9:12:30] blackmar14: Aziz was talking about setting up a cop union which i think is a great idea
[9:12:32] Jrey000: yea Criminals at most get a slap on the hand LULW
[9:12:33] Spired12: its like you need a lawyer present when getting dapped
[9:12:35] DonnBeach: Yeah the emphasis on reports leads to boring content
[9:12:35] TheLadyCupcake: crims = pve, all they do is interact with npc's LMAOOOOOOOOOO
[9:12:37] Chok679: im new to this what is a DAP?
[9:12:37] ebos22: PD is 100% more stressful then crim
[9:12:37] cboys41: crims are punished more often its just the cop punishment is 60 DAYS
[9:12:42] Jeremyohno: Daps are good one at a time, not 4 at a time
[9:12:42] oengeesa: Why don't they have like an evaluation for captain where each shift has to evaluate the captain that was in charge of that shift
[9:12:43] zyzzzo: you are one of them
[9:12:44] yxng_paige: i really hate that cops punishments are 60 real days when crims get minutes its silly
[9:12:45] frostflakeheron: where is archer Susge
[9:12:45] coldan01: I feel like dean would be stressed if suspensions were shorter
[9:12:46] Scoo73r: DAP timeline should not but such a large OOC timeline
[9:12:47] Tenhalla: Susge where did archer go?
[9:12:49] smpies: i think you should give feedback to dev
[9:12:49] RicoLoco52: @jinnytolls this
[9:12:49] party_buffalo_: mee to
[9:12:50] arcticbearx: the DAPs are too much atm
[9:12:50] ecstasy_1000: companionship is my dream
[9:12:51] ArdentCause: Especially if it feels that its targeted - even in the viewers eyes
[9:12:51] GlitchyGunZ: in your case I think if you lost your police job you could reroll a crim and people would still watch. you’re just that good @esfandtv
[9:12:52] Mijnboot: Susge kit
[9:12:52] Architank: It's not RP when people stop having fun
[9:12:52] KYslippy: rules being soo heavy this early on is bogus. give em some time
[9:12:53] StreamElements: Post top tier content to my subreddit https://reddit.com/r/esfandtv
[9:12:54] Jrey000: but I this point is not just rp LULW
[9:12:54] brimstonegusher: ARCHER SNEAKY
[9:12:55] rizaus: Burn out is real and stress is the leading cause of it.
[9:12:55] woolfdesign: You need to RP around real life mechanics
[9:12:56] coldan01: wouldn't
[9:12:57] amigaran: wacthing ssaab's stream he clearly enjoys the power trip
[9:12:59] mrjuicypanda: Are you going to the Streamer awards?
[9:12:59] nationas: lies and politics drama is a lot of fun and even daps but it can be too much
[9:12:59] doggensteinn: i respect the RP, but at this point it's going a little too far. Slacks wasn't really reasoning with you which is surprising
[9:13:00] vicious_pen: I think we can all agree the DAP system is flawed
[9:13:00] xFibonacci: thought u were typing report
[9:13:01] party_buffalo_: no wait im not
[9:13:01] Scarecro0w: @ZilzGaming yeah, kinda sucks if you are on the pd and then you get fired and people don't want to watch your character doing something else
[9:13:02] BenthamBestBoy: Susge
[9:13:02] ch3kd: pd needs a union, cornwoods nightmare
[9:13:02] iwannanuhh: Spelling something wrong in a report and it hangs over you for 2 months IRL. Commit terrorism and you will be back on the streets in 2hrs
[9:13:02] MacVane: viewer here literally debating if i can watch COP RP anymore
[9:13:04] AnusReaktorMan: Susge

[9:13:04] Smishhh: @jinnytolls sounds like a lot of actual police departments irl lol
[9:13:05] RedpiII: True
[9:13:07] Architank: powertripping as "RPing" is not good content
[9:13:10] limechair: love the rp, munchkins can drown
[9:13:10] jakob125: Susge 󠀀
[9:13:11] Wibze: there should be different forces that way if you want to be a strict cop then be one.
[9:13:12] TheLlamaTrainer: DAPS are a good IRL concept. However at the end of the day this is a game and should not have people stressing IRL over a fake in game job
[9:13:12] claptil: It would suck to have him go
[9:13:13] TimmayHS: yea but if you get fired you wont lose your irl job
[9:13:13] minich4rmander: denzel is a fantastic cop. ruth is a c*** LUL
[9:13:13] poisonousbagels: character bleed is real NODDERS
[9:13:15] Trepko: Need a cop union or IA to keep Captain's in check
[9:13:17] taraannee: i cant imagine dean is having fun in 4 hr meetings being yelled at in gta lmao
[9:13:18] Dreadwolf777: if cops get literal suspension for days then crims should get real life days of prison time or both shouldnt get punishments that bad
[9:13:18] MuckyWut: are you excited for GTA 6 RP? if there is one
[9:13:18] DetoxBKG: Can't you guys talk on Discord OOC to coordinate storylines for everyone in the PD?
[9:13:19] heftylefty_prime: It seems like a sim more than RP at this point unfortunately. At least imo
[9:13:19] ebos22: Dean is great
[9:13:19] DiscretionaI: Craftmanship and wit
[9:13:19] ImStuckInATreeDud: WutFace lack of emoticons
[9:13:20] arcticbearx: Dean streams are great to watch
[9:13:20] brimstonegusher: BASED FirstTimeChatter
[9:13:20] xDeadxRabbitx: his chases are the best too
[9:13:20] Brundeen: FirstTimeChatter
[9:13:21] Ricanelite: esfand so what makes your day as a successful stream at the end of the day. Even if it's not just RP. Like when you do other games.
[9:13:21] TheKingOfWit: I think removing the suspension or making it less time would remove a lot of the stress
[9:13:21] mossbergswerv3: you keep saying Ruth is just Rping...its becoming more and more personal for her.
[9:13:21] bobbybeee: now it's low key and scared
[9:13:22] Jrey000: yea I was so mad when he got dapped for getting NUNU... that was such good content LULW
[9:13:24] capitanseven: Cops rules are too strict, you get shit on for literally everything
[9:13:24] blackmar14: he gives the crims content by engaging with them
[9:13:24] party_buffalo_: can we do a 5 word max in ur chat?
[9:13:25] GottaJhett: Once you’re running Little Texas just run that area with all the suspendees lmao
[9:13:25] Krovix: sadly for some it's more than just RP. they take it super seriously
[9:13:26] Rebsdorf_TFT: There is Bad rp and Good Rp, one breeds content, the other kills
[9:13:26] SpungoWungo: Its fun when cops are not just robots
[9:13:26] BoogieAnimal: What?
[9:13:26] captain_steve_420: The number 1 rule of RP is that everyone has fun
[9:13:28] ecstasy_1000: everyone around me are not real people
[9:13:29] doc_jade: DAPs should be for super serious offenses
[9:13:29] lankybreak: dean is so damn good
[9:13:29] DezalbM: he has the perfect cop comm voice
[9:13:30] sendemup: den is the MOST FEARED officer atm imo
[9:13:31] noah_a_104: esfandTonys esfandTonys esfandTonys esfandTonys
[9:13:33] COREYT0WNS: Firing Cornwood or Den Zel would be all-around bad for the GTA RP community.
[9:13:33] zyzzzo: the captains are barely taking leads on the situations so they never make mistakes
[9:13:35] reetz99: denzel still getting daps after meeting smh
[9:13:37] thesmoogers: You have to have them here or there.
[9:13:38] BradleyKalani: All of this is great content. Even how invested chat gets (except when they take it too seriously lol)
[9:13:40] coffeecatsbrains: is the streamer life just a guessing game though? how do you plan where to go next in a way that keeps viewership high?
[9:13:40] Drewtly: @MacVane what upsets you the most about the content?? ive watched alot of PD POVs and esfand smiles through it unlike the rest
[9:13:41] itsdubbz710: nah
[9:13:41] PeyotePillar: like getting in crims cars KEKW
[9:13:42] WildWolfX: need that Antagonist
[9:13:43] walk1ng_v1rus: not when denzel does it ALL the time
[9:13:43] Architank: Nah
[9:13:43] Acrael: that's literally moon's stream
[9:13:44] coldan01: YEP
[9:13:45] crunchycheeto99: Is it clear to Rpers if they can actually get fired from daps? If not it should definitely be clear to them
[9:13:45] thesmoogers: You can't have 100% people that are power hungry
[9:13:45] Mijnboot: YEP

[9:13:52] Gachiguru: https://7tv.app/emotes/65b1db88babbbe4e8f24cd7e AAAA
[9:13:52] claptil: The elevator was so funny OMEGALUL
[9:13:52] 1CaptainRedBeard1: I think the powertripping is great, but the problem is the DAP system that goes along with it cheapens it A LOT.
[9:13:54] ecstasy_1000: this is what the system did to everyone in my life
[9:13:54] redrum359: COP TAKE
[9:13:54] itsdubbz710: thats like a bad DM not letting the players play in DnD ruth is just a bad DM
[9:13:55] scopedin07: i think Ruth needs to get off her high horse
[9:13:55] party_buffalo_: ur right
[9:13:56] pallywacker117: Feels like it's actually becoming stressful to rp as a cop now... a little too much
[9:13:56] AngeloJulius: YEP DRAMA
[9:13:56] Zeronogo: the impact in the game is amazing

[9:14:04] yxng_paige: ruth is an amazing character for story
[9:14:04] zyzzzo: it's annoying imo
[9:14:04] kikisocial: Cheever RP is amazing
[9:14:04] taraannee: ya BUT it clearly is leading to too many issues thats stressing ppl like dean out irl
[9:14:05] gillyp01: Susge
[9:14:05] bladeezz1816: Can’t get suspended if u start lil Texas LUL
[9:14:06] bygodwest: the fact that she makes people as mad as she does tells you how good she is
[9:14:07] limechair: do you ever read these after the game?
[9:14:08] vicious_pen: @esfand you are only wrong in that it CAN be good RP.  But it isn't always.  It can be toxic.  It can very easily go toxic even unintentionally
[9:14:08] jtm0516: ruth is a reason why everything is so stressful though

[9:14:34] FelipeLLs: IFISPEAK
[9:14:35] stealthy__one: it should be up to the point of getting fired though, unless someone is truly ruining rp

[9:14:46] Mijnboot: FirstTimeChatter

[9:14:48] FelipeLLs: IFISPEAK
[9:14:48] rickosaurus_rex: yeah but she still lied about Den, as a cpt you shouldnt be rping that way, ei she aid he wouldnt answer her questions, she said that to turner
[9:14:50] slymox: I think the situation sucks for Den and PD morale is shit, but I love the content. Everyone involved is doing great RP
[9:14:51] R0Rty_: Wait is andrews a self insert
[9:14:52] MacVane: @Drewtly the hammer looming overhead with DAPS, the fact that PD is undermanned and under supplied and the outcome is almost predetermined its just not enjoyable like 3.0 was it feels like I leave work and show up to work again
[9:14:52] loganstaygolden: both jp's lmao
[9:14:54] Krovix: moon2M i'm not a self insert chat

[9:14:56] AngeloJulius: @wysoft 100
[9:14:57] yxng_paige: if you think cheever is actually like that you need to watch from her pov shes very sweet and entertaining
[9:14:57] Doqx42: It would be better content if DAPs could lead to minutes/hours of suspension vs days of IRL time.  So then the Cop could stream off duty suspension time and then still come back on the clock and RP about all that occured while they were suspended.
[9:14:57] ebos22: The lying is what's making alot of people mad
[9:14:59] gillyp01: Is old LUL

[9:15:09] icup702: oh like Nck kekw
[9:15:11] kasded: @R0Rty_ Nope hes memeing 99% of time as COP in RP
[9:15:11] CrystalDimension: @EsfandTV it is OK but NOT when it leaks into IRL CONSEQUENCES for streamers (loosing job -> loosing viewers)
[9:15:12] jakerel: Vivek inserted himself KEKW lol
[9:15:12] magnets_: YEP

[9:15:35] xDeadxRabbitx: @r0rty_ definitely not.. he messes around on RP cuz he can’t irl
[9:15:36] MacVane: @Drewtly maybe I'm just missing the super fun shit while i'm at work or when i have to go to bed I just see paperwork and punishments over and over and over and it sucks
[9:15:39] vicious_pen: Dean will play it off cool but you can tell he's feeling real stress
[9:15:39] Drewtly: @MacVane thats fair, 3.0 had alot more command officers and i think that helped out alot. never saw so much copstacking in 3.0
[9:15:39] swampran: he's a caricature

[9:15:53] minich4rmander: powertripping characters are only fine if the punishment for the people under those powertrippers doesnt impact irl a lot. thats the problem with pd right now. ruth can literally fuck peoples irl up by being a cunt @EsfandTV
[9:15:53] Scottmayonaise: Andrew’s a parody @esfandtv
[9:15:54] GIGA_USER_: This one day haha i caught my sister having xes with our golden retreiver i of course made a video of it and posted it in our family whatsapp group, can someone tell me why shes angry about ME when shes the one who did it?

[9:16:01] blackmar14: extreme self insert

[9:16:02] Smishhh: andrews uses the chance to vent and talk shit when he couldn't irl
[9:16:02] Rascal_PM: the problem is putting RP cops at real cop standards. you can do it but then it’s not fun or a game anymore
[9:16:02] dhanurasana: miss that guy
[9:16:02] BleepBloopBloop: ooo that sounded nice
[9:16:02] dapyman: At times it feels like their is an OCC battle between folks who are RP only type people and streamers who do it for content and fun.
[9:16:02] Scoo73r: Your RP should not cause someone else IRL stress.
[9:16:03] Mijnboot: FirstTimeChatter
[9:16:03] DetoxBKG: a cop mutiny against the captains would be incredible RP
[9:16:03] rorro_narvaez: is squeex a self incert
[9:16:05] He_Who_Shall_Not_Be_Named: I think the best part is if you ever watch either cheever or xice streaming, you can hear them laughing and joking, total opposite of their characters
[9:16:05] kasded: @taraannee They all do they are spread to thin

[9:16:15] slymox: Most of the characters in 4.0 are. See: Cyr comments
[9:16:15] Neekapkilla: I think Andrews was having less fun because with the DAPs and talks this is feeling like his real job and not as much fun
[9:16:16] muricapewpew: does andrews still stream?

[9:16:25] Scrando: kekw
[9:16:26] AnusReaktorMan: People being sent to prison for 10 IRL minutes for violent felonies and DAPs lasting 60 IRL days makes zero sense

[9:16:27] laaazylemon: how do you feel about lies in rp, especially if they dont get resolved?

[11:58:52] Irry_: HUH
[11:58:55] meeshAKAsketh: Not for handling in city
[11:58:58] iwannanuhh: they have bigger engines they need big ones
[11:59:05] Rivath: the 59's aren't much slower and have way better traction
[11:59:13] bigpoints101: You have 3 88's
[11:59:19] ben_v_art: no for city they will be good, interceptor can handle the highway stuff
[11:59:24] FaramirRat: Mix the cars up and see what seems better
[11:59:24] evilmoose__: They dont all have to be the same.
[11:59:28] meeshAKAsketh: Most chases are city so I'd go for 50s
[11:59:29] Smoogol: mhm
[11:59:30] MrPersevere: Turdbos;?
[11:59:36] sKingNA: This is the best size for drivability and speed
[11:59:40] bigfaiz: turdbros...
[11:59:40] slatt5: it might be a power to weight ratio thing & putting power to the ground rather than the wheels with the small gear rations @EsfandTV

[11:59:57] Joongi_: YEP
[12:00:06] egoegox: yeeeeeeeeeeep
[12:00:08] daddyhardtears: YEP
[12:00:13] meeshAKAsketh: mhm yah city is more important
[12:00:16] Karter6t: Why dont you have different turbos for different cars? Why do they all need to be the best
[12:00:16] SlimTDC: kind of true
[12:00:17] DiscretionaI: +1 PTB within RP lol
[12:00:19] catfish_quackenbush: let slacks play around in the 59
[12:00:25] daddyhardtears: true but handling is a big issue too
[12:00:26] RexPappa: Could you make a simulated chase, someone with an interceptor getting chased by the turbo cars?
[12:00:29] rickyred66: Why not mix it up between shifts?
[12:00:32] xktpopx: Did I miss tarot
[12:00:33] dapyman: Need low & mid range power

[12:00:46] cheebah710: esfandVIBE esfandVIBE
[12:00:51] bluej255: need superchargers
[12:00:52] Toastedgamer03: gotta let slacks try the 59 since he only used 70 and 88
[12:00:53] reaper2204: they should have 1 tuned for top speed for every 2 tuned for handling then. there will be chases on the highways and out of the city too
[12:00:58] sping2: testing 20-60 is the sweet spot
[12:00:59] ChaoticSanity: gap closing
[12:01:04] getnthere: Have you tried with a manual transmission and the turbos? Because the turbos are suppose to make a huge difference in manual transmission cars
[12:01:05] Metalcalfe: Slacks was still beating you in turns with the 88
[12:01:07] Doqx42: do multiple U-Turn testing
[12:01:13] HistoriesPiston: Does Bump Boosting Effect the cars on NP?
[12:01:16] greenburg22: go do a chase in city @EsfandTV
[12:01:16] stillbaALin: @EsfandTV I think you might be onto something with your charcs parvo too worth swapping vehicles and giving it a go with Slacks
[12:01:16] slatt5: smaller boost is better for small gears its bottlenecking like a huge gpu for a small cpu
[12:01:17] Craxxbones: Def need a few 88's and the rest 54's
[12:01:17] eexile_: have him turn on top speed
[12:01:18] nabstonekido: I think 88 is pretty good
[12:01:22] Toastbane: should throw a repair kit on this car, maybe there's a big difference between 69 and 71, could be brackets
[12:01:22] Vangard__: Do a rolling start drag race
[12:01:29] DrWetbone: you normally only lose cars on straitaways
[12:01:31] bluej255: try snake around hangers
[12:01:45] MackPlays: @getnthere the whole PD would have to relearn to drive, not worth
[12:01:47] mosjefftv: Do a mock chase with both turbos
[12:01:49] ben_v_art: EZ
[12:01:51] Soap__64: keep in mind that everyone's driving ability is different too. balance should be factored in as much as top speed
[12:01:54] Ross_McD: 10 mins brother
[12:01:55] bigfaiz: turbos in the interceptor PagChomp Pause PauseChamp
[12:02:00] Kalious78: Just have a mix, if there's 3-4 cars in pursuit you'll have a few of each for both scenarios

[12:37:07] NLRubberDucky: Ruth is normally the only captain at the early meeting and she comes in and tells every to hurry up and leave
[12:37:20] HistoriesPiston: That'd be cool
[12:37:22] Rhevolution: @grilbur nahh. Look at the stats for the year. Ravens rushing has been great. I like Pacheco, but he can't do what the ravens eush are doing.
[12:37:27] crippledd_yoda: @rhevolution nah not Calvin cook lmao Lamar will rush for more than him in the first quarter alone. And I still remember giants were horrible in 2011 and beat the pats I like mahomes chances. I won't be mad if ravens win they got more to prove though

[13:14:49] JenniferX: your car needs a cool air intake. a NOS fogger system and a T4 Turbo, and direct nos nitrous injection.
[13:14:50] TheSlike123: not as a big burnout at the start tho

[13:15:34] earldabster: @puppietreats well not really but i kinda wish i did lmao

[13:15:54] Chem_40: hundreds of crimes happening , while cops are just messing around with car mods
[13:15:57] KYslippy: as long as you can power out of the turns
[13:16:03] PWRslide2: that is slower
[13:16:03] Evsta99: Hmm
[13:16:06] earldabster: @puppietreats 25 and too old for cocaine? bro thats when everyoen starts lol
[13:16:06] chron_bombs: you have to "charge" a turbo up with exhaust gas
[13:16:10] decentenuff: If you want instant torque you need a supercharger. @esfandtv does the mechanic sell superchargers?
[13:16:10] TacoBellKing: This is slower
[13:16:14] KaoticAus: taking longer to sppol
[13:16:15] rikaus69: This one is definitely sliwer
[13:16:16] SouthPaw1724: @Chem_40 More like thousands... Get it right

[13:16:32] JenniferX: turbos require lemonade.
[13:16:35] GlitchyGunZ: what’s making this experiment tough is the engines are so bad
[13:16:40] geckoguy69: can't wait for Cornwood to install Turbo Anti-Lag so there's constant gunshots when he drives

[13:16:48] PWRslide2: there didn't seem to be a traction penalty for the small turbo

[13:17:11] slatt5: the automatic transmission in video games are usually based time & not traction Sadge
[13:17:11] decentenuff: @grilbur still has realistic turbo mechanics/car mechanics
[13:17:22] puppietreats: @lilkindbisshhhh you should tell them that yourself

[13:36:40] OGprodigy: @imSteffin in our eyes but prolly fine for them
[13:36:41] Dricera: Does the gear not activate at all until you hit the speed level?
[13:36:44] BoldSlowbro: i think that the low turbos are not utilized because the handling is so poor, it feels unstable with the 29
[13:36:44] chirsg: how's fud? is it gud fud dud?

[13:37:31] kountz: isnt the 88 on you thought you were taking them out

[13:49:06] earldabster: like crims got 10 fold adv
[13:49:09] redrum359: @puppietreats it seems that just barely. the engine is the real difference, just w the bigger turbo a little more torque but handling is gone
[13:49:11] BoldSlowbro: think once the fresh engines hit the 56mm turbo will be the play
[13:49:14] icelander95: @kngrsm yeah so the Police arnt op
[13:49:16] bassoonerorlater: I’d love to see Cornwood learn to pilot a police helicopter
[13:49:25] Lanolinlol: my personal opinion is that devs are either lazy (doubt) or just trying to keep the balance in line
[13:49:28] Czechstasy: @Farmerr_ but then thats the result of taking the corner too wide, and not a factor of the performance
[13:49:31] wildarrow88: Slow your roll Maple. ARs 1st priority
[13:49:38] earldabster: there should be like one or 2 OP cruisers and the rest should be beefed up a little bit more
