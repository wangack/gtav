[0:46:05] QuesoCommander: would it?
[0:46:29] QuesoCommander: trying to think of what charges you'd get
[0:46:40] jimothy64: I guess having the keys would inherently link all of you together like a shared radio, if the keyholders don't show on MDT, that is.

[1:05:54] cdscarn: nakkiLurker
[1:05:56] CrisKross99: I wonder if that means you can’t get a ticket for running a red light because the cop would have to watch you stop to pull you over
[1:05:57] darthdin: was the vote 8-0 for it?

[1:06:57] CrisKross99: let’s just make all the intersections round a bouts and see what happens
[1:07:12] jimothy64: It just feels so... idk. Its the 3rd legislation that feels weirdly anti-rp to me personally
[1:07:16] FattyMatty1996: .... Why though?
[1:07:19] L2_Sentinel: I bet Tessa could win mayor if she wanted to
[1:07:21] peajay: Max said it was for people who do obey traffic laws so that they don't have to sit at red lights forever anymore. But it is a bit silly yeah
[1:07:29] RedBear_Beware: This and the adoption stuff is profoundly silly to me. Plus now you can't work at night? so weird
[1:07:46] tehhguyy: lebowski reference impheeWigl
[1:08:01] Pandrax86: If the stop lights worked better, it wouldn't be an issue. lol
[1:08:08] FattyMatty1996: I understand what they're trying to do but then why even have speeding laws?
[1:08:12] Sad_Lonely_Monkey: yah they made it a stop and go state
[1:08:15] ApocAFK: I mean, all this does is make it infinitely harder for PD to give out traffic light tickets right? Because the defense will always be 'I stopped for a second'
[1:08:19] QuesoCommander: as someone who prefers to drive legally, you are one of the very few who'd actually benefit

[1:09:48] Mang0_Mixer: tessa about to go broke for how many people say she’s their mum
[1:09:51] jimothy64: The adoption thing feels like "I don't like how you guys were doing RP", the months to minutes thing feels just straight immersion breaking, the traffic lights thing is stupid and just shuts down a bunch of non ping based PD interactions.. those three things I can't stand. Everything else is fine.
[1:10:00] JoeayIV: i mean
[1:10:03] JoeayIV: make it a whole thing

[1:10:49] RedBear_Beware: @ApocAFK I do too, but why limit it?
[1:11:00] IosefSerov: That adoption thing is just weird as heck to me

[1:12:14] Mang0_Mixer: she just adopts who ever is the favourite
[1:12:23] jimothy64: People have always been weird about family stuff in NP, and it never made sense to me. Same energy as "why are you upset I shot your pixel dog".
[1:12:51] darthdin: i miss pillbot

[1:13:47] Mang0_Mixer: baas would be struggling nowadays
[1:13:49] jimothy64: It just didn't need legislating. There was legislation saying the state didn't recognise wills and inheritance, that's all that was needed
[1:13:49] JoeayIV: no text back
[1:13:50] IosefSerov: We are in a holding pattern dave
[1:14:00] baircs: we need a command for the cornwood stuff lol

[1:14:27] cdscarn: DARTH buffpupHug
[1:14:32] Mang0_Mixer: na baas would be fighting it for his 7 kids
[1:15:15] jimothy64: That already was a legislation thing in 3.0, written by Crane, they just had to carry it over. .   Let's be honest. If Hon ever came back and was told Tessa wasn't his mother, that legislation would mysteriously disappear overnight.

[1:17:02] RedBear_Beware: You can't even claim your biological adult children as dependents unless they ARE dependents

[1:17:04] CrisKross99: depends on more than just being family.

[1:18:05] FattyMatty1996: again I ask.... why even have the wallet
[1:18:15] CrisKross99: right and even if they don’t fit into that, they might still be a qualifying relative (which is where you could have parents as dependents)
[1:18:16] doctorawesomus: my dad’s an accountant, ama
[1:18:17] RedBear_Beware: Yes, it depends on the state but essentially you to have to be disabled physically or mentally to be an adult dependent.

[1:44:49] StreamElements: nakkiToxic Every day, I must don my biohazard mask before I log onto Nakkida's stream. I do not know for what, anymore. Maybe it's the multitude of sheep that give me comfort. Maybe it's the various people in Nakkida's chat that makes it all worth it. But, being oppressed under the thumb of Twitch's most toxic streamer, Nakkida, it is not an easy life. I fasten the mask, and I go into the chat. Whether I will return alive, I do not know. nakkiToxic
[1:44:53] QuesoCommander: she's a Hufflepuff there's a reason she doesn't know what Ravenclaw's animal is

[1:47:04] Rekonin: They aren't evil, just their actions!
[1:47:09] ApocAFK: But all squares are Gryffindors
[1:47:14] jimothy64: Said Hufflepuff, "I'll teach the lot, and treat them just the same"
[1:47:18] Mimsy34: i found out recently that Delores Umbridge was slytherin.

[1:48:31] jimothy64: But the same poem that says hufflepuff will take anyone, specifically says Slytherin only takes those of the purest ancestry, so yknow... not *evil* but definitely.... yeah

[1:51:40] jimothy64: And then Cornwood spent the next time he crossed paths with Tessa defaming her in front of his superior without consequences
[1:51:48] molotov_michelle: True, never thought of that till now

[1:52:58] macman385: the choice is simple, time to nail his butt to the wall
[1:53:07] jimothy64: No, but it is a witnessed event that shows his character
[1:53:13] Codingale: poor camel's back
[1:53:14] molotov_michelle: Is animal cruelty even a charge yet in 4.0?
[1:53:17] OrestesTheSloth: Avery arresting Tessa  would be good. She'd be heartbroken

[1:57:20] nobodybodon: I THINK HE'S USED TO IT
[1:57:48] fartonthebox: they might raid him
[1:57:48] Codingale: I think it's more about bringing him along just for him to be caught
[1:57:51] darthdin: Were you nervous when Mary killed 7 times?
[1:57:56] nobodybodon: ok, and you say that like even if thats true, he wont have more on his record a month from now

[1:58:26] jimothy64: Last I heard he was appealing things, but he's been doing crime and escaping the whole time so.. he's got solid odds, even if it isn't a done-deal
[1:58:35] jimothy64: A new beginning
[1:58:49] ApocAFK: Right now, it's less serial killer, and more being a vindictive criminal
[1:58:57] dopamii: seeing someone drive the speed limit is shocking
[1:59:00] OrestesTheSloth: it's the rise of the Tessa crimer phoenix

[2:01:31] Officer_Jim_LaheyTPB: Will his 10-13 go off
[2:01:34] jimothy64: Los Santos is funny. Hundreds of AMGE on your record? That's chill. 3 dramatic kills? That's too far, life in prison! Lol

[2:02:03] OrestesTheSloth: If you got caught, randomly singing it to yourself in the cells could be fun
[2:02:05] Codingale: Oh wait they changed it?
[2:02:27] Codingale: I never thought about them having an off-duty 13a
[2:02:28] QuesoCommander: Tessa humming the song to herself at an intersection while Cornwood pulls up is more appropriate usage, it's like a teaser scare
[2:02:32] molotov_michelle: I thought the song name was the Hearst song?
[2:02:46] senatorsoup: what did I miss in last two hours y’all nakkiShy
[2:03:12] darthdin: last time was the ghostface  campfire for the song?

[2:18:04] jimothy64: Night hunting is explicitly illegal in many places
[2:18:29] FattyMatty1996: That's so stupid... like even towing and mosely's? because cars never need servicing at night right?
[2:18:54] jimothy64: PD scenes with abandoned cars never happen at night.

[2:21:12] FattyMatty1996: it's like the government wants to push people to crime...
[2:21:12] zalgo2028: What
[2:21:27] macman385: something is seriously wrong when real life guns are far cheaper than video game ones

[2:23:48] jimothy64: You would think they'd learn the lessons from 3.0; limiting civ activities to day/night cycles just kills those activities
[2:23:56] CatGotYourKeyboard: NODDERS
[2:24:12] senatorsoup: I did hear about those raises
[2:24:31] jimothy64: @landarokz you could do that anyway. It doesn't *let* you do anything, it forces you not to do things.
[2:25:41] sage40k: could call everybody to make the logs muddled lol

[2:52:27] StreamElements: Mary Wolf is Tessa's violent alter ego. Tessa Blacks out when Mary takes control and has no memory of what Mary does. Mary tends to be triggered by the senseless murder of aminals. Recently Mary has come to realize that nearly everyone is guilty in some way and wants to use the PD as a means to enact the justice that she has been craving. Typically, any time Tessa pulls the trigger, it won't be Tessa.
[2:52:40] IosefSerov: !tessa
[2:52:40] StreamElements: Tessa is no longer a cop in 4.0! Nakkida might make a new character to be a cop later, but for now Tessa is trying to find a new path.
