[0:24:04] LilMaGooby: It's the most nuked location on earth
[0:24:09] spazzles: so when the USSR fell, the Russian Federation were terrified of the debts of the old Soviet Russia, so they bulk terminated old contracts and things.  basically they claimed that there was no governmental continuity between Soviet Russia and the Russian Federation.  that would have nullified the NDAs from a legal aspect
[0:24:14] AziraphalesShop: There's a fascinating documentary called The Babushkas of Chernobyl about a group of old women who moved back to their houses near Pripyat inside the exclusion zone because it was home.

[0:50:59] tyrelrahl: The finding new doors adds to the moonshine run.  It adds an element
[0:51:23] KarnEvil: yeah, if they make a crap batch probably just dump it instead of running it.

[1:03:52] KarnEvil: Fricc cold butter
[1:04:02] MyNameisTiff_: Cold butter is bad.
[1:04:04] Kthanid: Might as well place a lump of ice on your bread.

[1:04:20] kaiguy6d9: cold butter plus hot bread though
[1:04:32] laxwall11: What's the positive of cold butter? I am open to hearing if they are any
[1:04:36] Ms_LadyMix: Cold butter on hot bread is only good because the bread warms it up
[1:04:44] VTMonster: I mean if you're just eating a stick of butter it's better if it's cold
[1:04:47] iamsickntwisted: cold butter makes hot bread colder, which is a no from me
[1:04:51] KarnEvil: butters gonna melt anyway.  might as well start with softer butter
[1:05:09] AdventurousEmma: I also love a butter bell but my house gets really hot in the summer and it melts out lol
[1:05:19] Insaif: Or at least just leave them in the glove box.
[1:05:23] ThomasTheDestroyer: I just have a stick in a container on the counter. Why make spreading butter harder than it needs to be?

[2:04:38] Denetti_: it seems very consistent. 5() sales regular then, 2's show up
[2:04:52] lorddracnor: Can you charge somebody with accomplice if the main person (Floki) get's an immunity deal? Or do they still need to charge the main person?

[3:42:10] sharingiskaren: um dating a cop isn’t a reason?
[3:42:31] doc_sharon: the bad things she has done outweigh any personal connection, at least to me
[3:42:31] Siirika: But Lane's experience with her shouldn't blow back on the club as a whole, which is the biggest risk with it all rn
[3:42:31] lorddracnor: We don't know what she's told McNutty about the Raiders when she clocks off.
[3:42:44] doc_sharon: would be so spicy Hypee
[3:42:44] AshuraX13: It would be so spicy
[3:42:47] Kthanid: It'd be nuclear levels of spice.
[3:42:52] BedBones404: the biggest thing i think of is that she's put herself in a position to constantly have people second guessing her with the cop stuff. O gotta fix that
[3:42:55] Insaif: Fair enough.
[3:43:07] blazinbanshee: Can I share a funny clip from admc?
[3:43:08] IchibaToll: Not mistrusting her motives may be fair, but this is more about mistrusting her judgment, IMO.

[4:15:21] MyNameisTiff_: KEKW
[4:15:29] if0rg0t2remember: because the acronym isn't originally english
[4:15:32] sharingiskaren: It's French
[4:15:34] pickleviiiic: AAAA
[4:15:49] doc_sharon: if he had a mojo dojo casa, it would be all about ISO NODDERS
[4:15:52] shamgar600: ansi all the way
[4:16:09] sharingiskaren: honestly we use it in manufacturing a lot
[4:16:15] AziraphalesShop: There are ISO standards for office practices
[4:16:21] frsttyyy: Although one might think ISO is an abbreviation for "International Standardization Organization" or a similar title in another language, the letters do not officially represent an acronym or initialism.
[4:16:24] lalablacksheep9: I just got done picking up my groceries and I am laughing so hard listening to this KEKW
[4:16:35] Count_Nodonora: I mean, part of my work is to make sure the company I work for is compliant with the ISO 27001 standard and it's a LOT of work. I know Nikez also does something similar for the company he works for so I understand how it could have taken over his life.
[4:16:36] KarnEvil: Yep, gotta pay to get a copy of the standard
[4:16:41] zemoj: oh yeah, you always gotta buyt the standards books

[4:16:55] BedBones404: the new nft scam

[4:17:13] sharingiskaren: it's really for businesses lol
[4:17:44] shamgar600: My company gets audited regularly to retain our iso certification
[4:17:50] Karleesi: https://clips.twitch.tv/CrazyWonderfulSowKAPOW-p0NBSzG8q1Ty1Guz
[4:17:53] AshuraX13: This was his plan all along! To make Kate advocate for ISO KEKW
[4:18:04] zemoj: the great thing about standards is there are so many of them xD
[4:18:06] sharingiskaren: Just two MC women discussing ISO
[4:18:06] Count_Nodonora: I'm starting to get concerned for you Kate.... You're becoming a little bit too knowledgeable about ISO standards, I think they're starting to take roots.
[4:18:25] sharingiskaren: yep that's a thing
[4:18:28] willowfennec: yes my company does for even our process plans
[4:18:30] kangg: barbKEKD
[4:18:46] doc_sharon: katesSmile
[4:18:51] willowfennec: it's an industry standard in many businesses

[4:19:47] KarnEvil: gonna need like 5 sewer trips a day if you keep up this many chop jobs.
[4:19:58] CozyTeaSipper: It's because of french. They didn't want to have an acronym that's different for the languages, like NATO, which is OTAN in french.

[4:20:01] Nightbot: Follow Kate on Instagram! instagram.com/kate.ttv

[4:20:42] Insaif: Everything is just stuff people made up. katesShrug
[4:20:43] Count_Nodonora: @sharingiskaren What they said. If the company I work for isn't compliant with ISO 27001, we wouldn't have customers because they wouldn't trust us with their information security. We have to renew that certification yearly and it takes weeks for the audit as well as constant tasks throughout the year.
[4:20:49] UppyFF: money isn’t real
[4:20:59] pellet5: Rue needs to read The World is Flat
[4:21:04] AshuraX13: Same way you renew licenses katesShrug
[4:21:05] KarnEvil: @MxPlumbean yeah, USB has its own governing board.
[4:21:09] DirectorStephanie: Why do I feel like we're getting way into the weeds?

[4:21:51] Insaif: That was an oddly specific example, Rue. KEKW
[4:21:54] Siirika: katesGiggles It's actually a VERY generic and not great tasting tea
[4:21:56] LilMaGooby: There's also an ISO standard for chocolate chip cookies, and it is AWFUL
[4:21:57] wonderifuwonder: Tom Scott did a whole video on that, well worth watching. TL;DR it's not a perfect cup of tea, it's a standard cup of tea, which you need for various types of testing.
[4:21:59] mohler_47: what does Rue think about the metric system?
[4:21:59] Count_Nodonora: Tom Scott made a video about that tea standard and said it's not that good, it's just standard. The purpose of the standard is to compare other teas against it.
[4:22:00] Kthanid: Well...they did, Rue.  They did.
[4:22:10] KarnEvil: KEKW
[4:22:14] Hoocairz: It may not be the best for each person BUT it's as perfect we can create an average... A standard
[4:22:19] ElectronicChaos: It's not meant to be a perfect cup, it's just... standard so you can compare different types of tea against each other

[4:29:47] willowfennec: the difference between broth and stock is broth has bones stock has veggies but doesn't contain bones
[4:29:51] Insaif: Kind of. You can get chicken based bone broth.
[4:30:02] lorddracnor: Yes, but bones come out of chickens, so... kind of
[4:30:02] Nightbot: Follow Kate on Twitter! twitter.com/katestark
[4:30:03] shamgar600: it's like rectangle square
[4:30:05] LilMaGooby: Nope, same thing, but bone broth can also be beef
[4:30:16] Insaif: @LilMaGooby Or pork.
[4:30:27] KarnEvil: they're pretty similar, but chicken stock/broth will have more than just bones when making them like veggies and shit.
[4:30:32] Kthanid: The only real difference is bone broth has all the stuff of reg broth PLUS it's made with the roasted bones of the animal.
[4:30:43] Nightbot: If you have Amazon Prime you can subscribe via Twitch Prime, FOR FREE! See https://twitch.amazon.com/prime for more details.
[4:30:50] IchibaToll: If you buy a box or can of "Chicken Broth" and it doesn't say "bone broth," it's different.
[4:30:52] sharingiskaren: yeah if it doesn't say "bone" it's not bone broth
[4:30:55] LilMaGooby: The process of making them is the same, one just has more actual chicken on the bone when boiling
[4:31:06] Camiigwen: Yeah like bone broth is chicken bones. Chicken broth is chicken bones and carrots and onions and celery
[4:31:11] Nightbot: Follow Kate on Instagram! instagram.com/kate.ttv
[4:31:14] doc_sharon: it might be multiple trips even with more people NODDERS
[4:31:16] DirectorStephanie: "Bone broth is different from chicken broth. It is a liquid that has more protein, collagen, electrolytes, vitamins and minerals than chicken broth. Chicken broth may be ok for cooking, but bone broth is much for concentrated and delicious. Bone broth also gives you nutritional benefits, while chicken broth does not." - as per Google

[4:31:36] Camiigwen: lol I wouldn't say that chicken broth has NO nutritional benefits
[4:31:53] Camiigwen: Calories themselves are nutritional benefits
[4:31:57] LilMaGooby: Powdered has next to no nutritional value
[4:32:10] DirectorStephanie: True. But I'm just copy-pasta'ing what I found so ;-;
[4:32:20] Camiigwen: Oh yeah, I'm commenting on Google, not you!

[4:32:40] doc_sharon: NODDERS
[4:32:44] AshuraX13: Yesyes
[4:32:53] ThomasTheDestroyer: My understanding was that bone broth and stock are the same thing. Is that right?
[4:32:54] Camiigwen: My mom makes chicken broth every time she buys a grocery story roast chicken
[4:32:56] LilMaGooby: Ya, it's essentially the same process, but with different additions
[4:33:05] lalablacksheep9: the flavor profile is different bc of the ingredients. I make my own and pick everything off the carcass, roast it until caramelized and then make broth with it. I skim off a lot of the fat but there’s a ton of collagen and stuff from the skin and joints.
[4:33:35] Insaif: I wish I could eat ginger more. I love the flavor, but raw/potent ginger tries to mess with my breathing. katesCri
[4:33:39] doc_sharon: I feel like next time we run into McNutty, we should ask him about bone broth katesGiggles
[4:33:46] Hoocairz: Chicken broth is cooked over a few hours, Bone broth is 12-48hr. It takes down the bones more.
[4:34:26] doc_sharon: ya I'd love to hear his take some time
[4:34:27] teacupcryptids: Yall are just too efficient
[4:34:32] Insaif: I just realized: you never did the photo shoot, did you?

[4:35:11] doc_sharon: katesBongo more market time
[4:35:20] Hoocairz: That looked really painful, ngl
[4:35:24] ThomasTheDestroyer: Okay, so if bone broth is the same thing as stock, then those of you who make your own should try finding chicken feet the next time you make it.  They are insanely good for getting even more collagen in your stocks.
[4:35:27] doc_sharon: nice!
[4:35:54] A_Humble_Wooper: OOOO
[4:36:00] Camiigwen: I seriously debated picking up chicken feet for my dogs last time I was exploring new treats, but as a vegetarian I couldn't handle the idea of picking up the chewed on feet

[5:15:20] AshuraX13: katesNoted

[5:15:31] flathaed: 1 Door = 35
[5:16:16] hecktobreakfast: HVAC: 45; Tire: 35; Door: 35
[5:16:18] A_Humble_Wooper: So all car parts are 35 each.
[5:16:19] Insaif: Car parts = 35 each.
[5:16:31] KarnEvil: chop parts are 35, hvac are 45.  EZ
[5:16:47] Insaif: HVAC is 100% the way to go, then.
[5:16:49] doc_sharon: katesJam katesHypers
[5:17:27] AziraphalesShop: But can you get a higher number of car parts more quickly?
[5:17:33] ThomasTheDestroyer: So, yeah, car parts are fine, but HVAC is better. Because you get, what, 8 or 9 car parts per run?
[5:18:01] arcaneskies: what does being at 100 rep get you?
[5:18:01] doc_sharon: esp since chop parts are big for rep NODDERS
[5:18:01] KarnEvil: @Insaif oh for sure, but when chop is so easy to get a job vs roof it works out to be worth the chop weight imo.
[5:18:02] Insaif: 5 trips.
[5:18:08] A_Humble_Wooper: She'll get a good jump start with this trip, it's a big one.
[5:18:26] Insaif: @KarnEvil Yes and no, they are getting more than enough roof jobs and get more parts per job in many cases.
[5:19:02] A_Humble_Wooper: And hvac parts are way lighter, so they can carry a lot more in a single sewer run.

[5:24:15] lorddracnor: @Insaif I wouldn't be surprised, Lang's Talon armor was based on Shredder katesGiggle
[5:24:18] Insaif: I think the head injury also makes you lose health faster.
[5:24:30] doc_sharon: have a few days of rubs NODDERS
[5:24:42] AshuraX13: I imagine you have a mountain of jewelry parts

[6:00:33] AshuraX13: That was nice Yesyes
[6:00:41] Insaif: If radios were even half the price, or had a longer battery life/better range, it would be worth it. katesShrug
[6:00:42] kay_bs0919: that would be like $30,000 per month on radios
[6:00:43] doc_sharon: katesCheer Rub time
[6:00:56] firefrye: I wonder if radio balance is intended for one per "group" rather than one per person?
[6:01:00] BedBones404: i would hope theres a mechanic that allows you to recharge them or something at a house
[6:01:06] A_Humble_Wooper: 30k per person per month, even.
[6:01:12] Insaif: @kay_bs0919 And that's assuming an average usage and not burning through the battery faster by usage.
[6:01:13] tyrelrahl: As long as the club follows the Maxx run to the car idea this should be ok
[6:01:21] hecktobreakfast: outside of battery life and cost, what else do we know about radios? is it a matter of finding a blueprint? we don't know?
[6:01:25] Kthanid: SO 30k or 21.5 pawn rubs. KEKW
[6:01:26] Insaif: It definitely forces you to preplan or coordinate better.
[6:01:32] AshuraX13: Saususge
[6:01:34] firefrye: or if radios are supposed to be for "big events"
[6:01:35] lorddracnor: I like the idea that they are for faster jobs, like heists and stuff.

[6:01:46] doc_sharon: katesGiggles
