[0:24:40] dragon_lord201: If I want to check out a game I go to what states on Steam then I have a look on YouTube people who do reviews on there and then I go watch it on Twitch and there'll be my final thing to see if I want to get it or not
[0:25:02] solid_swede: There used to be a service in the UK called boomerang rentals where you could rent a game for a week to test it for a small price before committing to it. I miss those services. @uhsnow

[0:26:10] xXxEV0xXx: Pretty sure you used to be able to rent games with netflix too i believe. Back when you got the movies and games in the mail and had to mail them back to get new ones.

[0:26:39] Beopuppy85: Games are subjective. Some people love a crap game and others hate it. If people dont have the same tastes a review means nothing essentially

[0:26:42] MDM4ever1986HD: haters got to hate

[2:55:47] Bot_Frank: Wait so hitting you with a missile is just battery
[2:56:03] FlGJAM: There's laws for beach properties and parks for excessive littering of food to feed wildlife, like seagulls and what not "Don't Feed The Animals"
[2:56:03] DizSpartan: reminds me of come fly with me when they're the security and they test the drugs to inventory them LUL
[2:56:21] Ray308win: the food is government-owned property kinamaHmm
[2:56:29] SentryBuster44: Does the food have the tray still?
[2:56:35] BfAleTitan: Cornwood was stockpiling prision food on himself for most of 4.0 so far
[2:56:35] AnalgesicPM: They'd get the shit beaten out of them
[2:56:40] zap_rowsdower_42: being werid
[2:56:42] crazyredneck118538: why would u want to take jail food cuz it f^^^ sucks
[2:56:43] Breo_McGuinness: My father went to school with Mr Legal expert and he said this Sussy
[2:56:44] BfAleTitan: but it started going bad lol
[2:56:47] felarinnil: probably theft?
[2:56:48] darkhouse54: Theft
[2:57:01] MacL0ven: DOC was talked about during the meeting the question was asked tally up how many people are in prison at a time if its higher than 1 then maybe we can talk
[2:57:03] mallonthesheep: unsmuggling
[2:57:03] Hibob222: it was theft
[2:57:14] crazyredneck118538: it would be actually category that stealing from a government
[2:57:14] monkeymitch332: in the British army its illegal to sell official ration packs 😂
[2:57:21] zap_rowsdower_42: i think cornwood took a bunch once
[2:57:22] Warsore_RH: I thought they made prison food expire after Cornwood was stockpiling
[2:57:23] DrDandelion: I don't think that exists IRL
[2:57:33] fourty6n2: Wouldn't it be the same as stealing food from a restaurant?
[2:57:36] infectious37: is prison food outside the prison contraband? prob not
[2:57:42] FD1793: if the prison is state run is it theft of gov property?
[2:57:43] SpectralChimp: would it fall under some kind of unlicensed food sale law?
[2:57:48] Arby91: I'm a corrections officer and yeah I agree it probably would be theft
[2:57:52] Jimmysqueeker: Could you take them to a.. Food Court LUL
[2:57:58] Rcdagov: If its intended to be free and being sold theres technically a case for fraud but thats grasping at straws
[2:57:59] Ray308win: I am totally lacking knowledge on 4.0's legal definitions but if food is a government-provided service "paid for by taxpayers" then it could be embezzlement govt
[2:58:02] DizSpartan: it'd probably be like a federal smuggling goods?
[2:58:10] Juicyfruitgum: Or maybe just limit the prison food will fix
[2:58:10] Bot_Frank: Wasnt there a story about prisoners smuggling crisps from the prison commissary out of prisons because that's the only place you can buy em?
[2:58:23] zap_rowsdower_42: NVL? haha
[2:58:25] mr_punx_204: @felarinnil  its not even close to being theft you are able to get this food for free you should be able to take it when leaving
[2:58:28] MacL0ven: Lawyers are doing a good job of keeping people from getting sent really atm because they usually have time served for staying in the cells
[2:58:29] DrDandelion: I'm a former prison guard and honestly they wouldn't care if people took things out of a prison. They only care about things going in.
[2:58:30] AnalgesicPM: operating without a restaurant license
[2:58:49] B_Elkjaer: Just find a price for the food, and if they don't have a receipt, bill them for what i would have cost
[2:58:57] Ray308win: It's totally the kind of thing I'd just arrest someone for and throw out a wild articulatabley-petty charge and take it to court kinamaLUL
[2:59:20] MacL0ven: Yeah I agree unless they need a timeout KEKW
[2:59:23] Gigass: higher fines lower times is the best
[2:59:30] Hibob222: its petty when its a small amount when you do it. in a mass amount to the point  of cutting out a sr. buns in this case.  its a problem
[2:59:37] darkhouse54: Real life it would probably be charged with something like unauthorized sale of food to the public ...something health and food related
[2:59:43] AnalgesicPM: I think a server with an intense prison scene and high functioning DOC could be sweet - but NP ain't it
[2:59:50] AnalgesicPM: IMO
[3:00:07] MacL0ven: I like how much felonys hold weight atm its great for pleading down for a lesser charge
[3:00:12] Bot_Frank: Higher times to me punishes the player not the character if that makes sense
[3:00:20] DrDandelion: That's just weird RP lol
[3:00:43] MacL0ven: yup ive done it like 10 times so far
[3:00:46] Hibob222: doc is good but it takes a bit to fill up the jail to have a need for doc
[3:01:14] DrDandelion: Throwing food out of prison is weird RP
[3:01:20] sunding88: i dont think theres anything wrong with saying : i suggest u get a lawyer. like.
[3:01:25] Terr0rBytes: Could just repeat and ask if they want representation?
[3:01:25] B_Elkjaer: What if someone just figure out a price for the food, and if they don't have a receipt, bill them for what i would have cost

[6:56:06] Sonicfear: Xavier is one of the best.
[6:56:30] Sonicfear: He is big on decorum when it comes to these convos.
[6:56:41] Silent: I'll give you alll the evidence give her full time full fine
[6:56:42] PoOdged: Good thing king won't be able to be questioned at the bench trial :)

[6:57:23] brunop83: Xavier serious and good lawyer. Ramee terrinle
[6:57:29] nebxhelix: Going to court can set a presidence
[6:57:38] brunop83: Rammee terrible lawyer and funny
[6:57:50] Sonicfear: He gonna do his thing in Bench, is it really worth the time and energy...This is her first offense.
[6:57:59] BakinPacman: bench trial = no precedent LUL
[6:58:07] TheDoubleF: I think she means negative precedent?
[6:58:08] dreamquest1989: @brunop83 Ramee is awesome as alwyer. he fights for his clients. and goes hard against the PD bullshit lol
[6:58:27] Sonicfear: Xavier has a good record with these.
[6:58:38] hippieh8rlol: Ramee as a lawyer is good in different ways. on actual law... not the best.  but loopholes and sneaky stuff he can sell to get his clients some help
[6:58:43] Virtux_: Wouldn't opening the safe or breaking the washing machines be intent to rob? Or would you need to know what was taken from the safe?
[6:58:52] BakinPacman: what set the alarms off i wonder
[6:58:59] StageName: nope
[6:59:14] StageName: they were just hitting the machines
[6:59:22] brunop83: @dreamquest1989 well... you have a point but.... he is better than xavier. In my opinion no but is funny asf thought
[7:00:17] Silent: Didn't really think about how hard it could actually be. How can you prove the difference between vandalism and robbery
[7:00:20] Sonicfear: And?...she keeps riding on circumstantial and non-specific facts.
[7:00:26] StephyFace: all comes down to proof
[7:00:45] StephyFace: doesn't matter what you k now if there's not proof
[7:01:02] mardukwow: @brunop83 they do lawyer in very difrent ways, rammee destroys the prosecutor to win his cases while xavier pushes law
[7:01:04] DanLGG: yeah proving it is extremely difficult when the burden of proof is beyond a shadow of a doubt.
[7:01:20] BakinPacman: the fact that theres no physical evidence is huge in a court
[7:01:36] Sonicfear: And what was robbed?
[7:01:39] Bakemaan: what
[7:01:41] Sonicfear: Specifically
[7:01:42] Eemelii: sntSuffer
[7:01:47] joe01522: doesnt matter in a court of law Kappa
[7:01:51] kerndeezy: NotLikeThis
[7:01:53] StephyFace: probably a good one to go to bench trial just to settle the argument honestly lol
[7:01:58] Eemelii: NotLikeThis
[7:02:07] Silent: how can they prove its a robbery and they didnt just go destroy the place
[7:02:18] Sonicfear: Sure, ever heard of the knife play defense? LUL
[7:02:19] TheDoubleF: "So what", aww ma gahd
[7:02:25] salveck: people were DAPed for that
[7:02:26] DanLGG: if you fail the robbery is it still robbery
[7:02:28] BakinPacman: this is why vandalism was good charge someone else did
[7:02:36] hvanity: Easily could be mayhem and vandalism, interesting they can't see it
[7:02:47] brunop83: @mardukwow brilliant .I agreed on that 100%
[7:02:48] Sonicfear: This officer is about to be embarrassed in court.
[7:02:53] mstet7: they are good cops but if this was the first time someone heard them say this stuff you’d think they were awful
[7:02:59] Eemelii: i hope this goes to court
[7:03:07] salveck: they vs she
[7:03:09] BIumenT0pF: isnt the burden of prof on the pd ? so the story doesnt matter

[7:04:31] Sammazing: Its a special day!
[7:04:36] BakinPacman: judges dont like dispatch cards but a call might help but it would have to be very specific wording i guess
[7:04:38] bmrobirts35: @uhsnow this has been fun to watch

[7:05:13] StephyFace: I think this is a good bench trial, just purely b/c there's a divide on opinion within officers of the charge vs proof
[7:05:13] Bakemaan: yeah it really depends on the judge at this point its 50/50

[7:05:51] Veixa: The world would be a weird place if you didn't have to prove someones guilt, you just had to assume it

[7:06:17] StageName: How much weight does a ping hold?
[7:06:23] BakinPacman: anyone could make a fake call
[7:06:30] DanLGG: I think it’s more than likely they robbed the place but the burden of guilt is beyond a reasonable doubt.
[7:06:32] BakinPacman: is the general response
[7:06:35] salveck: no
[7:06:54] Bakemaan: @DanLGG thats where they are stuck, they know they robbed the place, but they cant prove it.
[7:06:54] StageName: exactly
[7:07:03] cmcdonald22: yeah, its a tricky situation.
[7:07:04] mardukwow: im not gonna comment onm how i think this would go because ive watched almost purely lawyer RP in 4.0
[7:07:08] caladan13: Thought this server treated those as suspicious grandma calling 911.  could just be a jogger, etc.
[7:07:20] KillnMeSmlls: and it sucks because the burden of proof is on the state. The police/DA has to be able to prove the crime took place. If they can't, there's no case.
[7:07:29] Sonicfear: This case is one piece to the puzzle but it's not the last piece.
[7:07:46] cmcdonald22: i always enjoy watching these discussions.

[7:11:01] awful_oracle: 100%. Is the issue that the machines don't give an item that you can't point at as the stolen goods?

[7:17:37] sunding88: he always says he is going. then something happens in rp and he is still there hour later LUL
[7:17:59] DanLGG: I think it needs to be presented to a judge for future situations just like this
[7:18:28] BakinPacman: isnt court like reasonably guilty more than not like 50/50 is too conflicting but something like 75/25 is more likely than not
[7:18:38] BakinPacman: from something i remember crane saying in the past
[7:19:16] kenichi_ricci: Property damage?
[7:19:20] Eemelii: Smadge she must have stolen peoples laundry

[7:20:21] DanLGG: would it not still be robbery if the machines were empty? just curious
[7:20:36] quimmers: love the boomer facebook pic camera angle
[7:20:46] PoOdged: They might just not like washing machines
[7:20:46] StageName: also who says the machines were full

[7:20:49] esoogyerg: sounds like you have proof of destruction of property at best LUL
[7:20:52] MDM4ever1986HD: the evidence falls from the sky they think
[7:20:55] BakinPacman: @sunding88 theres give and take on both sides due to GTA itself
[7:20:55] StarWhistle517: uhsTea
[7:20:59] twymanos: If there's no evidence of something stolen it feels like Attempted Robbery at best
[7:21:00] KillnMeSmlls: whether or not a robber took place is not the issue. The issue is whether or not you can tie the crime to the suspect
[7:21:01] Eemelii: ashlolSip
[7:21:02] sunding88: if its not a given then why break it. i mean. couldent u press something like vandalism.
[7:21:03] Chrissy1337: here is the problem guys, there are no mechanics to get any evidence, no witnesses to ask, no shop owner
[7:21:05] Walla_x: You're still robbing something, even if it's empty. But it's up to them in RP to prove the charge. Let it play out chat

[7:22:09] NinjaL1nk: I think a better question is, is a failed robbery still a robbery?
[7:22:17] sunding88: that would make the 911 calls too powerfull wouldent it?
[7:22:20] ihateonions: can the hostage be eye witness of them taking stuff from the machines ?

[7:22:58] BakinPacman: they would have to see money being handed around right?
[7:23:07] BakinPacman: that could be interesting
[7:23:10] sunding88: ive had a server with similar 911 calls. and we purposfully deleted info on those calls. cause its too much info at some point.
[7:23:17] mstet7: 1000% shouldn’t be pushed
[7:23:20] Eemelii: nodd
[7:23:24] Sonicfear: A decent lawyer could cull past 911 calls and bring a myriad of calls that were designated one thing and turned out too not be the designated call.
[7:23:38] BakinPacman: 911 calls remind me of the idea of SWATTING

[7:35:06] sunding88: dna should be hard to take. cause its such a powerfull tool with the ingame mechanics.
[7:35:18] DanLGG: I think it’s 5050 just based on evidence alone. With Xavier not being the prosecutor for pd but rather the lawyer for the defendant. 30/70
