[2:20:32] Bonafideone: maybe going uphill
[2:20:33] Zophory: @EsfandTV Cornwood needs to stick one leg out and kick to go faster

[2:21:36] iwannanuhh: 4 cylinder corverete
[2:21:37] SteveAdeptus: @burlykomododragon The dev straight up told Cornwood that the only reason they can't add turbo is because they are rentals, they can have turbos added after they are purchased. Esfand forgot though lol
[2:21:38] Killa_Clown: A 3 minute ad right as he's responding to my comment is crazy.

[2:21:47] Kayhas: easy to handle when you're going slow :P
[2:21:48] omgnerf: I think with a turbo it will be insane its just not redlining to switch gear turbo will push it overbthe top

[2:22:06] platty1_: whichever car moon was using yesterday seemed pretty good
[2:22:08] chives4523: they need an automatic with paddle shifters transmission to be able to get to the higher gears
[2:22:09] burlykomododragon: @SteveAdeptus oh shit thats really dope
[2:22:09] sphugetteh: Is it emanuel?

[2:22:11] repivv: Probably intential
[2:22:13] Killa_Clown: lol yeah
[2:22:14] MrDireVT: I don't get it, if anything cop cars should be fast with poor handling because losing cops by pulling away in a straight line is way more boring than beating them around corners
[2:22:14] Thozel: but how it works with other people? does your char brick the car like othet before?

[2:34:35] Wandering_Ranger: @slomojosh yeah unfortunately that fact makes it a premeditated action, I get it now
[2:34:37] LogicWeasel: it is not becomming of an officer to get in a fist fight
[2:34:39] seethelight: @Ahs0kaTano was just thinking this LULW
[2:34:39] condor2104: so you fire a person for that? lol

[2:34:45] xnightshift2658: open hand and close hands are the same thing
[2:34:46] side_ofbeef: tackle and grapple
[2:34:46] Mic_Stargazer: What sucks the most is that this came from an accidental deskpop, K didnt even mean to hit him but he played along with it
[2:34:47] Wintyer2: Sounds like a Dap not a fire though right
[2:34:47] lowkey5arah: so he shoulda slapped K instead
[2:34:47] reverserakesh: To subdue?

[2:35:20] Mic_Stargazer: A baton is 100% higher th an a fist lol
[2:35:21] RicoLoco52: but it's still at the officer discretion.
[2:35:22] kylef_: why not daps
[2:35:23] Caeros: the question is the termination not that he did wrong

[2:35:31] ShadyMashX: If he got closed fist then he got hit with lvl 5

You just finished some Marxian historian, Pete Garrison prob'ly, and so naturally that's what you believe until next month when you get to James Lemon and get convinced that Virginia and Pennsylvania were strongly entrepreneurial and capitalist back in 1740. That'll last until sometime in your second year, then you'll be in here regurgitating Gordon Wood about the Pre-revolutionary utopia.

[3:16:37] imSteffin: forsen
[3:16:37] ComradeGreetingCard: no one wants to work with a guy who sues them
[3:16:38] TheKingOfWit: suing someone to work for them will just make them find another reason to fire you
[3:16:39] Brakon: HE needs to play this out or make a new cop character
[3:16:40] Zarniwooper: @cheesymarine12 He was actually upset OOC yesterday for losing his long time cop character
[3:16:41] BattleAlpaca: top speed is now 155
[3:16:42] Thozel: ask him to top it
[3:16:42] jessielight: when I watched Slacks they (being Snr officers also) agreed to daps, Ruth and a couple snr officers upped it to termination then it had to be voted on. Firing wasn't considered till Ruth
[3:16:43] Firehead94: u cant sue your place of work and then expect to work there all hunky dory
[3:16:43] M__Wolfe: He cant be a cop anymore because the Captains dont give a shit and its their word only
[3:16:44] Smoogol: IFISPEAK <- me for the past hour
[3:16:46] comrade_raptor: he should go suck slacks dick and see if he can get his job back that way :)
[3:16:47] NickMastaFlex: if hem sues them he cant be a cop anymore
[3:16:48] Gachiguru: Apologizing admits guilt and he didnt do anything wrong so he should NEVER apologize.

[3:16:57] tys0nnnnn: sueing the police force probably isnt the best course to being a cop even if he gets his job back he will be outcasted
[3:16:59] Mic_Stargazer: @endokei It depends on the context of the conversation. It can be if it's one made in public.

[3:17:09] syyyrp: i feel u

[3:17:16] Gamer9281: from what I heard he didn‚Äôt violate any use of force policy
[3:17:17] BattleAlpaca: he did not intend to lie he did not explain that well he thinks he did nothing but they wanted him to give more detail @EsfandTV
[3:17:17] Joongi_: I genuinely believe going to war with Ramee is NOT how you get your job back LULW
[3:17:21] RadarRotator: @Phindrius kekw
[3:17:21] Lite_Ice: how can he possibly do that when the captains say no

[3:17:24] Advenum: The swede rips corners
[3:17:25] RietArtwork: i'ts glued to the ground yes
[3:17:26] EWDijkstra: it's great RP all around, but yeah, his character jumping into a lawsuit is just burning a bridge

[3:18:03] comrade_raptor: doesnt winning a wrongful termination case get your job back???
[3:18:04] Whiezy: it comes down to do you want genuine or fake expressions for him. judical action = upset coworkers. genuine action = understanding co workers
[3:18:05] jessielight: its great rp for wrongful termination
[3:18:07] Xiraken: Wouldn't it be a good thing if he sues and gets the dap system changed. That would be a good outcome

[3:18:39] Astral_Rage: pepeW no it doesn't you just get money
[3:18:39] Felrane: get your job back but they will put you on shit duty and watch you like a hawk
[3:18:39] Claxman2000: if you sue for wrongful termination and win, you don‚Äôt get your job back. you get a monetary payout.
[3:18:40] EvilCoatrack: Winning wrongful termination means you get paid, that's it

[3:18:44] imSteffin: If you try to get your job back by force you're going to be greeted with force when you get back.
[3:18:46] MaNSoN6649: They should have made it go 150
[3:18:47] PoisonDart11: winning a wrongful termination doesnt mean u gett ur job back kekw

[3:18:51] Raja_Banhammer: fors
[3:18:52] ummjupie: slacks would definitely try to get his job back, but the question is do the other captains want that
[3:18:53] grrgoyle: Dude's complaining about tire grip... lol
[3:18:54] Smoogol: IFISPEAK

[3:19:16] zfalcorz: just make LASO already 4Head Kappa
[3:19:17] RietArtwork: i like that too
[3:19:17] Toastedgamer03: winning a court case to get your job back can make your work life hell due to personal feelings of the boss being as critical of you as possible
[3:19:17] Thozel: Rally driving
[3:19:18] Acadian7: lawsuit may set a precedent, but it is 100% a guarantee of never getting your job back
[3:19:20] marneraiders: Let him try the VSTR
[3:19:24] StormiNyan: sueing them would get u compensation maybe but not your job back ICANT
[3:19:24] Vikairius: They wouldnt rehire, they would just have to compensate loss of wages

[3:19:31] ZachFromChat: @comrade_raptor so you roleplay based on what... real life?
[3:19:32] Smoogol: IFISPEAK  Û†ÄÄ
[3:19:32] M__Wolfe: If Johnson did not tell the truth unintentionally, then his only case is to sue because the captains are tyrants
[3:19:32] imSteffin: Yeah they usually go for monetary compensation rather than getting their job back
[3:19:32] JakeStratic: Honestly it sounds like Johnson already has 0% chance of getting his job back and it is over. They won't let him back in. Which is why sueing, while bad is the only option.
[3:19:33] Chronic1diarrhea: slacks was fired?
[3:19:33] Mic_Stargazer: It feels like he doesnt understand OOC he needs to RP it out tbh
[3:19:36] GLSMarbles: Wrongful termination lawsuits are usually for people who don‚Äôt want to go back to that job
[3:19:36] wewill17: I want a turbo in that car
[3:19:37] jessielight: that is such a cool ride

[3:19:42] theshoover: What about my Johnson?
[3:19:42] Pandrax86: @Toastedgamer03 That's called retaliation and is illegal irl in governmental positions.
[3:19:43] LHaxorP: if he won that wouldnt slaks prbly have to get demoted that would be wierd
[3:19:45] imSteffin: It's confusing to sue your ex-employer for a seat in.
[3:19:45] Claxman2000: @toastedgamer03 you don‚Äôt get your job back, you get paid a sum befitting of the damages
[3:19:46] Astral_Rage: If the goal is money: Sue If you want your job back: Don't sue
[3:19:47] Darothane: @Toastedgamer03 that's why you get your job back and then quit on your terms
[3:19:49] Xtendid: @chronic1diarrhea no bruh‚Ä¶ Gregory Johnson
[3:19:51] Gachiguru: He could go for wrongful termination and then apply for BCSO
[3:19:51] adaa12345678: what'll happen with a winning lawsuit is Ramee gets paid xdd
[3:19:53] Joongi_: Gets his job back -> Says hi in a weird way -> Ruth gives him 9 DAPs kekw
[3:19:53] TheKingOfWit: If I'm Johnson, I'm making a new character
[3:19:55] Firehead94: @comrade_raptor but its RP, what kinda of attitude will captains or any leadership have towards johnson moving forward if thats how it played out
[3:19:57] matanzlatan2000: @Toastedgamer03 irrelevant, justice has been served and you got your job back, what angry people think isn't relevant and if they do some shit to you again they'll lose in court again
[3:19:58] jeremyks9: Problem is no human resources or IA for the police department. Who does the captains answer to?

[3:44:53] Clodhoppr: i agree with your sentiment, but i also think IC he should play his character how he chooses, he's RP'd for a while
[3:44:53] Janman88: growth
[3:44:55] Wintyer2: Johnson Made a video that really bad about slacks he F'd never coming back
[3:44:56] Booyal: not to mention if you get your job back through suing, co-workers won't really dig ya
[3:44:57] TheRoseForce: Gotta get in at the start
[3:44:57] itisacar: cornstuck
[3:44:59] Mic_Stargazer: in character its just an overall bad decisino to try and sue PD UNLESS his actual goal is reform and not getting his job back, but it isnt
[3:45:06] Ancor_: you just unlocked that
[3:45:08] Kaiyo_exe: @EsfandTV Ramee also seems to like stirring up drama
[3:45:11] LowKiiiTV: @TheRoseForce Holy fuck

[3:45:31] FinnMurtons: mayor max said jail food meta will be ending
[3:45:31] ZachFromChat: why doess everyone expect cornwood to solve all their problems though?
[3:45:32] imSteffin: monkaSTEER
[3:45:33] Smoogol: uhoh
[3:45:35] TheRoseForce: @LowKiiiTV Yes mate! Restart is the time to get in
[3:45:41] typicaluser777: I think Johnson also just has a hard time understanding things, that's what Ruby explained, he doesn't get the points being made which make it much worse
[3:45:42] M__Wolfe: Yeah but if what Johnson did isnt wrong (making a mistake) then why let th Captains roll over you
[3:45:42] plzhateme: sunny said nobody goes to snr buns anymore lol
[3:45:46] MackPlays: Who cares about speed when you look badass
[3:45:48] omgnerf: Prison food change incoming soon

[3:45:54] PsychoJoker: Cornwood is approachable
[3:45:54] GYNECHIATRIST: SAJ buy him a house
[3:45:56] LowKiiiTV: @TheRoseForce I tried but it kept giving me an "unable to connect" error
[3:45:56] Neekapkilla: What do you think about Mr. K and Ramee calling him a dumb fuck every time they see Johnson. Like stuff can be funny but it seemed pretty bad faith after the 100th time
[3:45:57] Zakuras: because they know you will
[3:46:00] CHEATERS_UNITE: noticable
[3:46:01] Maz0hyst: @Sam92 Strap em to the roof
[3:46:01] condor2104: Cornwood has a good aura about him
[3:46:01] Khaosshinobi: LULW
[3:46:03] TheKingOfWit: well you listen and solve problems, so this is what you get
[3:46:04] Kingbunsz: Yea he went to him
[3:46:04] PacGamer: I think it's because Cornwood is the most consistent and on all the time LUL
[3:46:06] puppietreats: it would be funny if he started a new cop char, and johnson turned into a crim like ripley did
[3:46:07] Verion: kekw always getting interrupted
[3:46:08] Beerbuddie: because cornwood gives his personal number to everyone and tells them to call him when they need him lol
[3:46:13] bobdang07hd: Because people need the RP so they love to yap
[3:46:17] Inz4ne_: you could be a little more harsh sometimes in character so they wouldnt do it always LUL
[3:46:17] blahder: But it's also good for growing rep on the server.
[3:46:18] spicyville: cornwood too helpful -1
[3:46:28] fellathedude: This cadent doesnt let Esfand talk LUL
[3:46:32] Ikilledkenny91: @zachfromchat cause he is always on so everyone knows they can get ahold of him
[3:46:35] sterred: @bobdang07hd PopNemo PopNemo PopNemo
[3:46:38] Mic_Stargazer: @isaacnewton5 Because that's kind of how it goes sometimes. It sucks OOC but even in the real world you have to sometiems just bite your tongue and say sorry
[3:46:41] SgtKellogg: where this vette come from?
[3:46:41] Rockshock: Could just tell people to follow chain of command as they should be doing
[3:46:44] Vikairius: Cornwood feels like he just wants to genuinely help despite how thin he has been spread.
[3:46:47] DieterK: @EsfandTV cornwood being a lawyer will bring more of that though...more phone calls
[3:46:50] Kaiyo_exe: @EsfandTV Do you feel it's partly your fault for people always coming to you ?
[3:46:50] MaNSoN6649: Ive seen a lime green tow truck
[3:46:53] Smoogol: WideHardo CLEAR CHAT
[3:46:54] ZachFromChat: Hes just never  been given the actual power, they just expect him to go through the effort into fixing it
[3:47:00] xseaka: is esfands radio off?
[3:47:01] greenboy420: idk i get its RP and i love cornwood but and the end of the day its game
[3:47:04] droksid00: cornwood is a force multiplier. he's good at rp so their rp is better. he's a central character. he's on all the time. he listens
[3:47:05] luxxen1: Also it's funny their viewers think Ramee and MrK are being "good" guys, when they are the ones who caused most of the problems LUL
[3:47:05] cashcody69: this other dude likes to talk about meatballs
[3:47:07] smok3mjane: did the cops finally get new cars
[3:47:11] CHEATERS_UNITE: forsenPossesed reeelyyy
[3:47:12] Toastedgamer03: cornwood being on all the time and being good to the community is what will help him become sheriff NODDERS
[3:47:12] Beep_Cx: Hi chat peepoLegs esfandCozy

[3:47:18] panda_snack: It‚Äôs because cordwood gets things done
[3:47:20] ZachFromChat: hi beep esfandL
[3:47:21] grrgoyle: The Swede's not sounding so depressed. Cornwood, a balm for depression.
[3:47:23] LogicWeasel: Cornwood is like everyone's therapist, he's an ear for them @EsfandTV
[3:47:23] samanthaxo92: if Cornwood could, then Cornwood would!
[3:47:24] Cerkins: peepoHey beep
[3:47:24] MackPlays: Cornwoods got a problem setting boundaries

[3:47:26] Beep_Cx: peepoWave
[3:47:26] MikeAvoo: Therapist Cornwood
[3:47:27] RhalArda: best advice he can give is "don't do crime"
[3:47:27] condor2104: yeah, sometimes people need good advice
[3:47:28] TheRoseForce: Cornwood the mediator
[3:47:29] Maz0hyst: @Beep_Cx peepoWave
[3:47:30] pontifux: But if corn could then cornwood
[3:47:32] SmugPls: Sure everyone else on PD does their job, but cornwood enbodies the law. He is the spirit and the glue. He is the one who is passionate about the city, where as the perception is everyone else is just regular workers
[3:47:34] spaghuet: if cornwood could, cornwood would
[3:47:37] Beep_Cx: saabWave
[3:47:43] Dynomyth: He can give bud fud dud
[3:47:43] Lucsvm: thats not fun
[3:47:45] EnochBlanche: He also gave him higher prio
[3:47:46] Mac_Parts: Oh really?
[3:47:47] Neekapkilla: Yeah but if you got fired on Cornwood would you make a new cop character?
[3:47:50] Mic_Stargazer: he even gave him prio then moon gave him prio too lol
[3:47:50] typicaluser777: Yeah Ssaab and Moon gave him T3 Prio apparently
[3:47:51] Gachiguru: so that means he cant ever be a cop again on johnson
[3:47:52] PeterPanTheKing: But that ruins the point og RP?
[3:47:57] claptil: It really isn't the same tbh
[3:47:57] Kingbunsz: @Neekapkilla he would not
[3:48:00] faroeislands_: But on the other hand, I can see how it can be misconstrued as witness tampering
[3:48:00] ZachFromChat: Okay so he's just RP'ing it out. if he want THIS character to be a cop he needs to put in the work
[3:48:01] zuperman270: he wants the rp though
[3:48:05] Gachiguru: he wants that character
[3:48:05] BigBlue31: we fucked you but here's prio btw
[3:48:05] MackPlays: People call Cornwood as 311/911
[3:48:08] IKEA_DOG: saab gave t2 prio moon then improved it to t3
[3:48:09] WineNot: that just ruins the rp lol
[3:48:13] Kappawaiixd: ye moon gave him prio
[3:48:14] Zendorea: Max gave him Giga Prio
[3:48:17] Brakdin_: @Gachiguru Where did they say that?
[3:48:17] CHEATERS_UNITE: forsen6UG dass crazyy
[3:48:21] ZachFromChat: he just needs to put in the work
[3:48:22] yungcrypt0: ayo when did we upgrade cop cars!?
[3:48:24] Beep_Cx: The long way esfandCOPS
[3:48:28] offbrand: the LONGWAY
[3:48:29] Eraborea: But if this is the way he wants to RP why force him to make a new cop character to get back in the PD ?
[3:48:29] Clodhoppr: its his choice in the end
[3:48:29] imSteffin: The long way = RP it out.
[3:48:30] condor2104: that is not bad, he should do it
[3:48:32] LogicWeasel: hopefully Johnson wants court RP, cuz that's the path he's on now
[3:48:34] Seve82: why do it the hard way when he could do it the LONG way
[3:48:36] Kilanii: thats actually dope though
[3:48:36] Kingbunsz: who got mega prio?
[3:48:38] Beep_Cx: peepoLegs Jamgie
[3:48:39] PacGamer: esfandCOPS üåΩ
[3:48:40] Mic_Stargazer: There's no downside to trying to reform Johnson for a week or something and asking, like why wouldn't you do the RP route?
[3:48:42] LogicWeasel: Ramee will turn it into good RP and a show, but PD will be pissed in-rp
[3:48:42] panda_snack: how does he even come back at this point?
[3:48:45] Gachiguru: @Brakdin_ telling him ooc to make a new character means johnson aint gonna be a cop ever again
[3:48:45] Kfoo_: Joker arc on this guy and then have his cop guy have an ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny
[3:48:48] Beerbuddie: if that's the truth... maybe they want the RP of the court case...

[3:49:03] Brakdin_: @Gachiguru That's not waht that means. If he wants to be a cop now he can remake or he can play it out in RP and earn it back.
[3:49:03] natalieb424: I rlly think ramee is gonna get in his ear and hes gonna go the court route
[3:49:04] Evilzanz: ramme metagames it feelike

[3:49:10] Janman88: ramee ofc trying to force it as he do YEP
[3:49:10] Mic_Stargazer: i'm said Rivers dropped his Joker Arc he started brewing once the PD fired him lol his char went schizo for a day or two there
[3:49:10] Eraborea: He feels he was wronged, so whats wrong with him pursuing this route
[3:49:11] justinienina: hi esfand!!!!!!!!!!!!! :D
[3:49:11] GYNECHIATRIST: he finna sue the PD cuh ong frfr
[3:49:12] nomad_hk: does prio carry through/
[3:49:14] Janman88: i mean thats him
[3:49:15] matanzlatan2000: nah, johnson should go to court and if hes proven right he gets back to PD, its justice.
[3:49:19] Kfoo_: Ramee just wants to dunk on Ruth
[3:49:19] condor2104: good point, maybe they want to RP the court case, more work for Ramme
[3:49:19] MackPlays: Lets just skip ahead to the endgame of 4.0 and allout war
[3:49:21] sterred: move on everyone, JOHNSON knows what needs to be done  esfandOkay
[3:49:22] BoogieAnimal: The player is attached to the character that is one of the factors @EsfandTV  not to get too chatty
[3:49:22] PsychoJoker: Ramee just wants money lets be real LUL
[3:49:23] LogicWeasel: well yeah, classic ramee
[3:49:24] Xen_Crypt: surprise surprise
[3:49:24] mwcarroll: the way ramee is doing it doesn't make sense - you don't sue to get your job back, you sue for lost wages
[3:49:24] imSteffin: or just sue him on Johnson, create new cop and join the PD force. best of both worlds Kappa
[3:49:25] CHEATERS_UNITE: forsenSwim
[3:49:25] quaylewastaken: They're mad because they told Johnson MRK reported him...
[3:49:28] robotjj: he would brun bridges

[3:49:29] Verion: Classic ramee
[3:49:30] ShakeShakey: YEP
[3:49:30] komplike: just rp bro
[3:49:33] droksid00: wait. wait. what if he killed off gregory johnson and his twin brother regory johnson showed up to take his place like in beerfest.
[3:49:33] Lucsvm: thats something he need to find by himself
[3:49:33] hipster_doofuss: johnson getting kicked in the johnson
[3:49:35] GorSTL: agree'd 100%. Burning bridges
[3:49:38] justinienina: have a great day mr. esfand : D
[3:49:39] Toluen090: You would need to meta and watch the interaction with slacks and Johnson last night to understand the chance he had on Johnson
[3:49:39] Najb0lji: what does prio mean?

[5:29:38] Eeyley: I think that criminals commit crime regularly and police are in charge of stopping that. I think the RP that comes from criminal interaction is acceptable for the continuity of the server. Even though crime is illegal, the criminals still commit crime. Without knowing any better I would expect police to handle that.

[7:35:59] lord__hydra: is that what he DONE
[7:35:59] JasonVoorhees71: nailed it right on the head rt sir
[7:35:59] suoicil: All he had to say was i‚Äôm sorry and it won't happen again, instead he doubled down. they gave him so many outs. I still don‚Äôt think he gets it. that‚Äôs the main issue.
[7:35:59] 2F1lthyCS: lol
[7:36:00] ZCrimes: tbh, he was just not getting it. but yes, he did not lie at all and was ok

[7:36:33] Gachiguru: HE DIDNT LIE
[7:36:33] Mic_Stargazer: The "lying" thing was weird in everyone's defense. One male officer at the scene claims he todl him to stop. That's not true. The female officer claims she did and she TECHNICALLY did but you can't hear it from multiple POVs
[7:36:33] galidorn269: yup you‚Äôre right

[7:36:35] RhalArda: he's not taking accountability and it was a trend in his behavior
[7:36:35] typicaluser777: That's one of the reasons they fired him, no accountability
[7:36:35] marczm4n: Johnson didn‚Äôt do anything wrong
[7:36:36] Takuto819: idk
[7:36:36] PacGamer: I can't tell if this is the character direction or ooc stuff

[7:36:39] hereforff9: integrity
[7:36:39] Neekapkilla: So in character he was asked about the situation and thought they were going to be charging Mr. K, he didn't know they were asking about his own actions.
[7:36:39] ScyThE619: yes
[7:36:39] HeyMeghan: YES
[7:36:39] PokeMom019: This is insane

[7:36:44] Jimmy_Tha_Quad: right
[7:36:45] oh_discordia: cant help people who wont help themselves
[7:36:45] SurelyBaked: yeah slacks is huge on accountability
[7:36:45] magnets_: @Gachiguru he did tho. he lied about how the fight started
[7:36:45] AfroAltruism: It's not clicking in his head for sure
[7:36:45] DrWetbone: the high command was keeping a file on Johnson with many complaints
[7:36:46] taraannee: YUP literally slacks TOLD HIM THAT

[7:36:47] Haretic: sound slike criminal behavior
[7:36:47] RedpiII: exactly
[7:36:47] TheLlamaTrainer: Yeeah I was on Johnsons side but the more this drags out he making himself look bad
[7:36:47] RicoLoco52: wonder what talking to York and McNulty would reveal
[7:36:48] Iron_Bjorn: 100% correct
[7:36:49] Switchblade142: They fired him for lying, but the problem is they're acting as if misunderstanding/misremembering a situation is lying
[7:36:50] jmangaman: i still think he doesnt get it
[7:36:50] Bosweny: tell him
[7:36:50] Viske: yeah 100% exactly what hapened
[7:36:50] BeatsSaid: tell him cornwood

[7:36:52] VRBApathyy: longest 20 minutes lol
[7:36:52] KillergamingsTUFF: can you blame him?
[7:36:52] JPhilly1205: he took accountability for the fight , but he said he didn‚Äôt lie
[7:36:53] prilemtwo: slacks said that
[7:36:53] Speeddevilx: slacks said only reason he was fired is for lying and show integrity @EsfandTV
[7:36:53] Wibze: he was telling at him too
[7:36:54] Vyntric: wait was duncan fired as well?
[7:36:54] HeyMeghan: slacks even told him to take accountability and he kept doubling down
[7:36:55] ZachFromChat: he literally does not understand what hes doing
[7:36:55] pontiicus: yep
[7:36:57] Karter6t: Sheriff sees what slacks sees
[7:36:57] RobRoads: He got hit by a car. He's mad as hell.
[7:36:57] claptil: Tbh he did say he was wrong to fight him I believe
[7:36:57] OldwisePaly: 100% all slacks wanted was him to take responsibility
[7:36:58] ManySadPandas: Bruh, there's a reason he has like zero reports in the MDT. He doesn't actually do the work
[7:36:58] 2F1lthyCS: For my mother, they worked so hard
[7:36:59] dudemanbroo: i think part of the issue is that some of the stuff they accused him of was false
[7:37:00] jaymass19: yea but couldnt have they suspended him first?
[7:37:00] Syn1285: hes slimy AF talking with a voice changer
[7:37:01] AngelRunz: he gone then RIP
[7:37:01] JasonVoorhees71: he just loops round the same things all time
[7:37:02] 2F1lthyCS: for money
[7:37:03] Berserake: He was using the pitting incident as becoming a victim of the PD instead of being accountable for being fired
[7:37:03] MDM4ever1986HD: tell him
[7:37:03] Joongi_: Johnson o7
[7:37:05] Buster_Buster: he could of just got 4 daps, had a conversation about what happened, learned from it and still be a cop
[7:37:05] Mic_Stargazer: He and other officers misremembered the events that occurred but their stories happened to match so he looked like a liar
[7:37:05] ryothfps: It sucks because there is lies on the report about what happened but he didnt say everything so it fucked it up @EsfandTV
[7:37:06] Nerdversity: @EsfandTV ssab said with everyone who has been DAPPED, they have always owned up to it, Johnson didnt OWN UP TO IT, and therefore was terminated
[7:37:06] Vikairius: Johnson is a liability. slacks did the right thing
[7:37:07] taffletv: you cant help someone taht isnt ready to accept the help
[7:37:08] pontiicus: this voice tho esfandLUL esfandLUL
[7:37:09] YEP46: Hmm see how cornwood can lead johnson to get slacks trust
[7:37:10] ItsSloth24: He refused to accept that what he did was wrong both with the fight and purposely omitting the parts of his statement that shows he bandaged took his vest off then attacked K again
[7:37:10] 2F1lthyCS: and happines and it was needed
[7:37:11] KillergamingsTUFF: can you really blame the man
[7:37:11] spongefrank: You should still defend slacks, hes d9wn talking your captain lol
[7:37:11] Toluen090: Yes and was given a chance
[7:37:13] M__Wolfe: PD need a union unironivalky and I hate unions
[7:37:13] a2th3vi: because you got into a fist fight lmao
[7:37:14] intoxicologistt: slacks gave the same treatment to penny, he asked her to tell the truth and she did,   but he didnt he lied and got mad
[7:37:14] salveck: flipping on others only
[7:37:15] RicoLoco52: @Vyntric suspended
[7:37:15] GorSTL: there are things that Slacks got wrong but Johnson lied about the lies
[7:37:15] 2F1lthyCS: but no longer
[7:37:16] Zanduin: Duncan was told to tame day off
[7:37:19] GYNECHIATRIST: why don't you ask in character if he takes accountability for anything Thinkge
[7:37:21] Firsthandpower: It's not about the excessive force!!!!!! Its about accountability and integrity
[7:37:24] Marthentic: Yeah Slacks gave him a chance and he burnt the bridge Sadge
[7:37:26] Syn1285: what
[7:37:27] Bano12345: Johnson is super reactionary it‚Äôs unfortunate
[7:37:28] Joongi_: Chat his lungs are messed up, leave him alone SAJ
[7:37:29] usakobun: im bored of this and shit of his stupid voice changer making my ears hurt
[7:37:30] judgement_12: he omitted information, that he doesn‚Äôt think was significant, so he can‚Äôt trust him basically because the omission could be purposeful or not but they can‚Äôt tell
[7:37:33] taraannee: slacks told him ‚Äúi was gonna give u 4 daps & 24hr suspension but u haven‚Äôt said sorry, or taken accountability & ur doubling down so you‚Äôre fired‚Äù
[7:37:33] 2F1lthyCS: we have the resources to share and live and work out of passion
[7:37:34] YEP46: Duncaning im just taking day off
[7:37:35] axm313: slacks kept saying he lied, thats what he couldnt get over
[7:37:36] Dreamdreams7: dadgum voice
[7:37:37] iMoore_: my only voice changer issue is I can hardly understand him
[7:37:38] jacksmithcje: that‚Äôs wild from maple haha
[7:37:38] 2F1lthyCS: and share out of love
[7:37:40] hereforff9: mcnulty ruby and slacks talked about it in depth
[7:37:41] slomojosh: @esfandtv it‚Äôs also complicated because in the 2 officers statements they told him to stop but on the bodycam they  never did so he‚Äôs technically not lying
[7:37:42] ZachFromChat: He refused to take accountability and then doubled down RIPBOZO
[7:37:43] Lord__Gen: tell him to sack up, and listen to your punishment like a soldier. accept it and shut your mouth
[7:37:43] MastaRasta420: the report is in the MDT in announcements
[7:37:44] AnusReaktorMan: slacks told him ‚Äúi was gonna give u 4 daps & 24hr suspension but u haven‚Äôt said sorry, or taken accountability & ur doubling down so you‚Äôre fired‚Äù
[7:37:44] rhaziaa: Johnson took it all too personal.
[7:37:47] HeyMeghan: he burnt it TWICE dude.
[7:37:50] spongefrank: He is aggressive right now lol
[7:37:51] pontiicus: mizkifComfy esfandCozy mizkifComfy esfandCozy
[7:37:51] Speeddevilx: slacks said only reason he was fired is for lying and show integrity @EsfandTV
[7:37:52] Syn1285: cornwood cant hear this?
[7:37:54] 2F1lthyCS: we dont have to a a paper representation
[7:37:56] ilmarcusil: Even though johnson was lied too, he should say sorry and own up to the lies???
[7:37:57] ImStuckInATreeDud: WAYTOODANK TOO MUCH TEXT
[7:37:58] masontheartist: Think he lied by omission of details in his report
[7:38:00] jy33130: There was a second incident with Mr k
[7:38:01] they_call_me_staceey: @psychojoker thank you. Trying to remember who that is but appreciate you
[7:38:02] zilaprime: JFC the voice changer is fine
[7:38:03] Firsthandpower: Yeah Johnson is playing victim when he did shit wrong
[7:38:04] jacksmithcje: maple said he needs anger management which just from maple is funny
[7:38:04] SavageTarzan: nakkiHm
[7:38:05] PandaNomsBamboo: bad integrity fired
[7:38:06] infintitedream: He‚Äôs in the right for his case but he needs to be accountable. Captains sucked during this but so did he. It‚Äôs a lose lose
[7:38:06] Neekapkilla: Okay but honest question esfand, why did derola not get a big punishment for lying in a report about Denzel? That's the issue I have with this.
[7:38:08] pontiicus: I can‚Äôt esfandLUL
[7:38:09] Mic_Stargazer: @slomojosh from one POV you can kiiinda hear her say "no" as if she hit her push to talk half way through the word but its a fuckup all around
[7:38:10] 2F1lthyCS: like how the number 0 is nothing
[7:38:10] cherochero: maple was told to find a therapist for him, they were going to tell him about it in the meeting he got fired
[7:38:13] oddesys: the ff7 music in the background
[7:38:14] 2F1lthyCS: is it nothing?
[7:38:14] the_main_burt: @spongefrank passion ad aggression is a fine line
[7:38:15] RhalArda: all he had to do was say something like "i apologize that i omitted that information. i didn't realize it was pertinent and that's my fault."
[7:38:15] RicoLoco52: The captains don't seem the best at explaining reasons for the decisions they make
[7:38:16] Karter6t: He has so many accident reports of assaults cause he escalates things. Didnt this all start with a Mr. K fight?
[7:38:16] rocker22_: still crazy this all spawned off a mis click by mr k for the punch
[7:38:17] BeatsSaid: he need some tough love
[7:38:18] JasonVoorhees71: need slow mode lol
[7:38:18] jy33130: Pulled him over goin 56 in a 55
[7:38:19] AnusReaktorMan: @esfandtv slacks told him ‚Äúi was gonna give u 4 daps & 24hr suspension but u haven‚Äôt said sorry, or taken accountability & ur doubling down so you‚Äôre fired‚Äù
[7:38:22] joesfarm: Slacks told Johnson, Mr k filed a complaint against him which started this but its a lie, Mr k never did
[7:38:23] 2F1lthyCS: or is the word nothing, nothing?
[7:38:24] quaylewastaken: Watch KingJayClouted with me on Twitch! https://www.twitch.tv/kingjayclouted?sr=a
[7:38:24] AndreSays: It's not that clear @esfandtv the statements don't match up
[7:38:26] ZachFromChat: lookUp  uh oh chats being weird again
[7:38:26] HeyMeghan: he still doesn‚Äôt get that you don‚Äôt punch back. imo I wouldn‚Äôt put him in the LASO either bc he still can‚Äôt take accountability.
[7:38:27] MDM4ever1986HD: EMOTE ONLY WideHardo EMOTE ONLY WideHardo EMOTE ONLY WideHardo EMOTE ONLY WideHardo
[7:38:27] diezul_1: whole stream about this?
[7:38:30] SavageTarzan: lookUp
[7:38:30] 2F1lthyCS: nothing is nothing
[7:38:31] Ma1o: Saab seemed confused on why he took this route
[7:38:32] SurelyBaked: yeah he keeps going into the incident when the whole time slacks clearly said the main issue was how he communicated after the fact
[7:38:36] iMoore_: i think my ears are just bad... i have a hard time understanding and following along the voice changer
[7:38:36] slomojosh: @mic_stargazer yeah but during the fight she was just screaming Johnson
[7:38:36] Maz0hyst: SCHIZO

[7:38:41] taffletv: Its kinda a shame... Cuz he is really good at the RP
[7:38:43] Nico_47: So he did get talked to about it before daps
[7:38:44] kikisocial: some people need to be told explicitly where they are wrong
[7:38:44] dapyman: McNulty & Ruby recommended the anger management
[7:38:45] Marthentic: UltraMad
[7:38:45] SavageTarzan: Waiting peeTime
[7:38:48] Joongi_: Oh Jonhson kekw
[7:38:49] jaaayteeeh: he hit someone else before k
[7:38:49] EthanGinger20: esfandThirst
[7:38:51] StormiNyan: Hmm
[7:38:52] imbruhhmann: @joesfarm and boom so slacks lieng off rip tog et him to tell on himself .. slacks cant be trusted either
[7:38:52] permacool: that was the class
[7:38:55] taraannee: i watched the clip & k punched him ONCE and johnson beat the shit outta K it was so unhinged
[7:38:56] Syn1285: just leave, this isnt the Johnson u know
[7:38:57] kid93: how is he angry LUL
[7:38:58] AnusReaktorMan: @esfandtv slacks told him ‚Äúi was gonna give u 4 daps & 24hr suspension but u haven‚Äôt said sorry, or taken accountability & ur doubling down so you‚Äôre fired‚Äù
[7:38:58] slomojosh: TBH this is just wasting time for you cause you‚Äôre not high command
[7:38:59] magnets_: slacks gave him to maple because the seniors suggested delegating johnson to another FTO cos slacks was so busy @EsfandTV
[7:38:59] Mic_Stargazer: @slomojosh yeah exactly. i think its something that actually shouldve been handled OOC but this RP is good too kekw
[7:39:01] HeyMeghan: he needed anger management for his anger issues on scenes with people.
[7:39:02] 2F1lthyCS: but 0 represents nothing so we can talk about it
[7:39:03] B15C_: Hmm peeTime
[7:39:05] TeeRiot: you gotta keep it real with him
[7:39:05] jacksmithcje: I get he‚Äôs taken no accountability but he also probably felt like it came left field which o get
[7:39:07] pakss_14: why dose aziz look diffeent all the time?
[7:39:09] Switchblade142: They fired him for lying. Where I disagree is that him misremembering/mishearing a situation is not the same as lying
[7:39:09] ItsSloth24: Slacks really didn't like how he omitted a lot of detail from his statement, ie. telling a half truth. Slacks saw this as lying on his statement and when confronted johnson doubled down.
[7:39:10] aant02: the pd fucked up lmao
[7:39:11] 2F1lthyCS: because we have faith
[7:39:12] BeatsSaid: tough love cornwood
[7:39:12] GYNECHIATRIST: Thinkge
[7:39:14] Bano12345: Johnson got screwed over though it‚Äôs just politics
[7:39:14] RicoLoco52: @dapyman this. because of other incidents besides just the Mr. K thing
[7:39:15] 2F1lthyCS: we know it exists
[7:39:16] 2F1lthyCS: nothing
[7:39:19] Leafyerick: The problem is Slacks kept telling him he lied but in Johnson's mind he didn't lie and Slacks never clarified
[7:39:19] FunkBish: pepeLaugh

[7:41:47] 2F1lthyCS: I use drugs, but only cuz I have faith.
[7:41:48] rossetk: slacks was talking about escalation from him
[7:41:48] Jimmy_Tha_Quad: honestly Johnson messed up by even being at Mr. K‚Äôs house

[7:42:08] DamnitAngel_: it should only ever be clearly self defense of ones life
[7:42:08] stuey_drake: the worst thing about this whole situation is. K did not mean to hit him and they both RP it out instead of doing there Oo I didn‚Äôt mean to do that thing that everyone does. it is crazy you can get fired for +1 RP
[7:42:08] HazyHung: You don't need to warn if he punched you already lol
[7:42:11] jy33130: It was supposed to be a hats off convo, but the bother officers have to cover their asses

[7:44:00] dudemanbroo: LOL
[7:44:02] Switchblade142: @taraannee Yes, but he was only fired for lying, he would have just been dapped for that stuff. Failure to articulate is not lying. Lying requires intent and he did not intend to lie.
[7:44:07] JasonVoorhees71: pepeSmoke

[7:44:29] soosmaz74: im starting to think pd is scared of mr k
[7:44:30] SarahFlare: @b2a80 I think mr k was purposely provoking Johnson, but I don't know 100%
[7:44:30] MsKibitzer: This started with a 3rd degree traffic ticket btw lol.. earlier in the day between Johnson and K/Ramee lol.
[7:44:31] PacGamer: I think he already went too far with the hasSlam RP if he actually wanted to get the job back on this char
[7:44:32] slomojosh: Johnson‚Äôs communication skills are just poor
[7:44:32] SephirothPhenyx: GRANDMAMA
[7:44:33] oofinside: @SavageTarzan TriHuggo DankL
[7:44:35] JasonVoorhees71: he beat th sht outa him not punch back lol
[7:44:35] Lord__Gen: esfand2 esfand2 esfand2 How does Cornwood convince Johnson to accept the lesson at hand? esfand2 esfand2 esfand2
[7:44:35] franzaoe: He doesn't understand lying by omission lol
[7:44:37] GorSTL: he did lol
[7:44:38] SephirothPhenyx: HAHAHAHAHAHAHHA WTF
[7:44:40] ComradeGreetingCard: communication is not the pd's strong suit
[7:44:40] magnets_: he got fired because he stepped back and healed and took his vest off and didn't mention that in the report
[7:44:41] sirbombabba: I saw the clip a while back lol
[7:44:41] Sizzlaa: Smokege
[7:44:42] GorSTL: that is a lie
[7:44:42] julho94: he did tho
[7:44:43] Motokid600: He lied because he was leaving out the large amount of time between the first and second punch.

[7:44:46] jy33130: Doctors report k said it was mutual combat
[7:44:46] bmrobirts35: why the voice changer
[7:44:48] HeyMeghan: @skingna he unfortunately burned this bridge to ashes. I feel bad but he could have just walked away and took the daps. he chose to lose his mind on them and then continue to not take accountability and blame ruby.
[7:44:52] claptil: Yeah calling him out for the Grandma thing is crazy
[7:44:52] Saggitari0: Johnson literally said before punching Mr.K "Im probably gonna get fired"
[7:44:53] Switchblade142: @taraannee Being wrong and misremembering/mishearing is not lying.
[7:44:53] EvilCoatrack: he left out that he paused long enough to remove his vest
[7:44:54] bladeezz1816: Syp

[7:44:58] masontheartist: his statements paints his actions in a different light
[7:44:58] taraannee: johnson blamed ruby to her face for ‚Äúnot asking him detailed enough questions abt it‚Äù LUL
[7:44:58] magnets_: he's leaving out so much here
[7:44:59] RicoLoco52: think people are missing key aspects of everything that went into slacks' decision.
[7:45:03] Joongi_: Siobhan: peepoSitCowboy
[7:45:03] StormiNyan: wouldnt this whole situation been avoided if johnson just admitted he made a mistake and fucked up?
[7:45:04] SephirothPhenyx: LOLOLOL
[7:45:04] Wallsh_: waiting at MRPD
[7:45:07] RhalArda: his report made it seem like he was hit and instantly swung back, which isn't what happened.
[7:45:07] microplasticbrain: @MaRiNexICEx right
[7:45:08] bullbabear: this voice changer hurts my brain
[7:45:09] smalllittleisaac: why he sound like that?
[7:45:10] AndHaka54: he right but not really
[7:45:11] Mic_Stargazer: He DID say it but he implied to slacks he didn't mean to say it out loud, it was a push to talk mistake
[7:45:13] wildarrow88: "My grandma don't even hit me like that" üòÇüòÇüòÇ

[7:45:21] w111iam1: yeah Esfand tried :(
[7:45:21] Joongi_: Siobhan at MRPD: peepoSitCowboy
[7:45:21] oofinside: APU mutual combat need a judge as a spectator
[7:45:21] AfroAltruism: it boils down to mis coms and lack of clarifying statement
[7:45:23] 2F1lthyCS: I see bad things such as rape or pedophelia or religion extremesits of any kind just dont understand why they are being showed these things. so they can help get rid of them as a communnity
[7:45:23] Valail: sounds like he is digging his own grave
[7:45:23] Wallsh_: cant understand 1/2 what he says
[7:45:24] hereforff9: hes not doing a great job of advocating for himself here imo
[7:45:24] narthell: why is he using a voice thingy
[7:45:25] s0stin: its not even about the fight. thats honestly good rp. he wont admit any fault and just gets angrier and louder.
[7:45:25] f1rst_f1re: a cop should know every detail, if you cant thts why youre fired. E
[7:45:27] PsychoJoker: Mutual Combat takes place in the courtroom i believe

[7:45:31] SephirothPhenyx: IIM FRIED
[7:45:31] GYNECHIATRIST: @StormiNyan ofc, but more RP this way xdd
[7:45:32] JasonVoorhees71: he still leavin sht out lol
[7:45:33] taraannee: @ricoloco52 YUP and it was crazy bc ppl were giving slacks in rp shit but ppl went into ssaabs chat giving him ooc hate NotLikeThis
[7:45:34] Syn1285: hes making it hard, fuck him
[7:45:35] slomojosh: that parts true
[7:45:39] BraerHZ: so many things wrong with what hes sayin
[7:45:39] stuey_drake: chat he didn‚Äôt say it, he said that grandma stuff and the im gonna lose my job for this stuff all in his head! that was not said out loud
[7:45:39] Neekapkilla: It's true they didnt' even say anything to Mr. K
[7:45:40] dapyman: He is focused on the wrong things
[7:45:41] SephirothPhenyx: THATS A CRAY CRAY CRACKHEAD STIRY
[7:45:41] hollowrust: yeah he exhibited a bad judgment call by pausing and removing vest
[7:45:41] f1rst_f1re: this is shitty RP
[7:45:42] Sizzlaa: yenomvPunch dont
[7:45:42] Switchblade142: @f1rst_f1re Then the entire PD should be fired because they've all done that.
[7:45:45] Saggitari0: Johnson literally said before punching Mr.K "Im probably gonna get fired"
[7:45:45] danielisgr8: NOOO

[7:45:51] StormiNyan: @GYNECHIATRIST I mean, you are not wrong. but he can still admit he fucked up
[7:45:52] Saggitari0: Johnson literally said before punching Mr.K "Im probably gonna get fired""
[7:45:53] w111iam1: yup
[7:45:53] Sizzlaa: YEP
[7:45:54] Nico_47: Yep he doubles down and blames everyone else

[7:46:03] EnochBlanche: He is in the wrong
[7:46:04] AndHaka54: he cant admit he did wrong either
[7:46:04] Snackkbar: does he ooc think hes right? or is he just rping?
[7:46:05] JasonVoorhees71: yeh but he cant or wont see it @EsfandTV

[7:46:06] Perterter: ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ what a waste of time
[7:46:07] jermslio: DAP not fired imo
[7:46:07] rhaziaa: His only defense is that he was concussed when Slacks interviewed him about the event and that's why he was argumentative.
[7:46:07] PoisonDart11: tough situation
[7:46:07] DismalShark: it's a tough one man
[7:46:08] the_main_burt: just be straight up man
[7:46:08] SurelyBaked: he's not doing himself ANY favors, even with so many people trying to help
[7:46:09] Van_1912: 2 other cops there did nothing.
[7:46:09] Karter6t: 4 bald people for a liar.
[7:46:09] WEB3curry_: he cant never be a cop again
[7:46:10] Nerdversity: @EsfandTV its all CAUSE, he didnt OWN UP TO ANYTHING, like its just say you messed up and move on, thats all slacks wanted
[7:46:10] Gachiguru: he is in the wrong but didnt lie and shouldnt be fired
[7:46:10] tonecomms: This isn't why he was fired either
[7:46:10] AnusReaktorMan: @esfandtv slacks told him ‚Äúi was gonna give u 4 daps & 24hr suspension but u haven‚Äôt said sorry, or taken accountability & ur doubling down so you‚Äôre fired‚Äù
[7:46:10] sKingNA: Hes wrong, but prolly shouldnt lose his job
[7:46:11] eskimojack32: but is that worth firing him over ?????
[7:46:11] misterboaty: He didn't get fired for the incident
[7:46:12] Puns_for_days: Kornwood would do some tough love
[7:46:12] Gr1zzz: the firing part is ridiculous
[7:46:12] typicaluser777: He is in the wrong that's what we're agreeing with haha he DOESNT get IT. RUBY of ALL people xplained it so nicely and he deflected
[7:46:12] julho94: he is in the wrong but i dont think he should be fired
[7:46:13] Sizzlaa: yenomvSideeye
[7:46:13] 2F1lthyCS: this is awesome
[7:46:13] slomojosh: exactly
[7:46:14] revengeitself: he cant step back and then swing again
[7:46:14] EvilCoatrack: Got hit.  Paused long enough to remove his jacket.  Then attacked.  100% in the wrong but it'd be okay if he admitted he was wrong.
[7:46:14] M4zzle: and get gaslighted that he is right LUL
[7:46:14] KizzyTwitchTv: hes so emotion invested in that character lol
[7:46:14] GYNECHIATRIST: @GYNECHIATRIST guess the character doesn't have it in him Thinkge
[7:46:15] nimbleop: he is in the wrong. But isn't that a dap? not fired
[7:46:15] myragome: Does the fact that K is on his side help at all?
[7:46:16] tpainbuyindranks: the lying
[7:46:16] microplasticbrain: still shouldnt be fired
[7:46:17] Nsan7: yeah he was Sadge
[7:46:17] Leafyerick: @EsfandTV He's in the wrong for the scenario but that's not why he was fired
[7:46:17] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: but Ramee and k want him to still be a cop
[7:46:17] sirbombabba: i dont think hes in the wrong
[7:46:18] Cloaked_in_Fiction: Well, he did admit he shouldn't have done it
[7:46:18] Lonestar_64: he was wrong for fighting
[7:46:18] MsKibitzer: Its his attitude btw..
[7:46:18] Mic_Stargazer: Lovesick lied on his report too if this is about lying
[7:46:18] hereforff9: he coulda just taken the initial daps L and been fine
[7:46:18] magnets_: he was in trouble for the fight but he was fired for leaving out large chunks of what happened @EsfandTV
[7:46:19] LHaxorP: @s0stin yea i dunno why he keeps going in this circle... Im mean its hard rp if hes holding to that "hard" character trait
[7:46:19] RhalArda: it's the integrity from the report
[7:46:19] albakrut: What is about?
[7:46:20] ScyThE619: YEP slacks fights for hiss ppl bro he really does
[7:46:20] Snackkbar: the fighting was fucking hilarious
[7:46:20] WEB3curry_: he should just rwtire
[7:46:21] Motokid600: They are
[7:46:22] stuey_drake: @saggitari0 ye but he said that in his head
[7:46:22] thebigchinballs: Why cant he understand that they care about him not saying all the details
[7:46:22] Mic_Stargazer: EXACTLY
[7:46:23] BaconHouseFive: siobahn is starving in MRPD lobby
[7:46:23] SephirothPhenyx: BLACK ON BLACK MURDAHHHHHHHHHH IN KANYE SINGING VOICE
[7:46:23] dudemanbroo: its not about what happened its about how it was handled by leadership after
[7:46:24] itsxavierrrrrr: Firing him seems too much though
[7:46:24] AndHaka54: yup
[7:46:24] Joongi_: @Van_1912 That's the thing, he was not going to get fired, but he doubled down :/
[7:46:25] 1CaptainRedBeard1: They definitely are.
[7:46:25] SurelyBaked: YEP
[7:46:25] Bushwick78: right
[7:46:25] Connorbrow: He is in the wrong, but he could have prevented himself from being fired by reacting differently
[7:46:25] masontheartist: You fully understand now ye.
[7:46:26] infintitedream: YES.
[7:46:26] Jimmy_Tha_Quad: unfortunately, for Johnson, I think his ship has sailed
[7:46:26] randyrandoe: It's fine he's in the wrong but he didn't need to be fired for it
[7:46:27] AndreSays: It's not enough to fire him over it tbh.
[7:46:27] claptil: Tbh all of them about to get fired
[7:46:27] RexPappa: fire them too then
[7:46:28] lowkey5arah: they are
[7:46:28] typicaluser777: YES EXACTLY
[7:46:28] juanelemichele: Is it fire-able though?
[7:46:29] taraannee: ya man, ruby, mcnulty, slacks & the captains and all the senior officers agreed with his firing so
[7:46:29] jy33130: Yea they trying to save their own asses
[7:46:29] davidpeck_: I think there watching daps too
[7:46:30] jmangaman: EXACTLY
[7:46:30] magnets_: the other two were punished too @EsfandTV
[7:46:31] eskimojack32: is what they did not worse?
[7:46:31] GorSTL: i love his character, really sad about this. His channel has the clip so he has to be RPing this
[7:46:31] AnusReaktorMan: DESERVED TBH
[7:46:31] Hitmehn_: doesn't deserved to be fired though
[7:46:31] CraigsWorldHD: His voice changer is crap can barely understand him
[7:46:32] the_main_burt: GL getting round this one LUL LUL
[7:46:32] TimmayHS: shouldnt he just get 3 DAPs and a 24hr suspension? @EsfandTV
[7:46:32] 2F1lthyCS: Yeah all are equal
[7:46:32] MsHollyyy: I mean I think we all know he was in the wrong but Slacks also in the wrong too lol.
[7:46:33] ManySadPandas: Even when you're giving him the opportunity, he is still playing the victim and taking no accountability
[7:46:34] snusge: more like WRONGson
[7:46:34] alexshaw: #Justice for Johnson
[7:46:35] SephirothPhenyx: COTDAYUM
[7:46:35] JasonVoorhees71: th other 2 cops said stop tho lol
[7:46:35] Hero_g: it aint a firable offence my doo
[7:46:36] Joongi_: Siobhan at MRPD: peepoSitCowboy
[7:46:36] Karter6t: Duncan was fired.....
[7:46:37] complexlalo: difference is if he will accept it which is hard to be fair
[7:46:37] WEB3curry_: boogey man its over
[7:46:38] Vikairius: That whole situation is a mess and all of them discuplined
[7:46:38] kikisocial: he thinks it's about the fighting which is the communication problem
[7:46:39] Motokid600: The other two cops failed to physically intervene.
[7:46:39] Breakduhlegz: i lub Dainish
[7:46:40] Minokawa_82: wrong chat? what yo mean
[7:46:40] haydenhw: for sure in the wrong but Fire him for it no suspension?
[7:46:41] HeyMeghan: the other two followed the chain of command properly but he isn‚Äôt saying that bc it makes him look bad
[7:46:41] RietArtwork: It's about not accepting being on leave for awhile
[7:46:42] SephirothPhenyx: JOHNSON DONE DIRTY DOE
[7:46:43] TacoBellKing: That's his main issue. It's their word vs his and they were also in the wrong, so why is he the only one being punished
[7:46:46] Nico_47: Yep he cant understand how he is in wrong, thats why spacks fired him
[7:46:46] huhddee: Everyone mad for different reasons
[7:46:47] SephirothPhenyx: LMFAO
[7:46:47] EthanGinger20: @florsema me neither man im just enjoying the show baj
[7:46:47] Puns_for_days: Siobhan
[7:46:47] Yevonai: This guy is always a victim
[7:46:48] Sizzlaa: that still has consequences
[7:46:48] ilmarcusil: @EsfandTV let him know what would just said?
[7:46:50] P4K_Little: it‚Äôs hard to get down to the details when he keeps talking about a bunch of different things.
[7:46:50] bertacharm: one of the big things was leaving out taking off his vest
[7:46:51] SephirothPhenyx: DANGGGG
[7:46:51] cheebah710: HypeDisguise
[7:46:52] Joongi_: @Karter6t Duncaning *Wasn't fired*
[7:46:54] jy33130: LUL
[7:46:54] Switchblade142: He was fired for lying, not the fight. He just didn't remember the entire situation and misremembered some things. That's not the same thing as lying imo.
[7:46:54] RedpiII: slacks said they will be dealt with
[7:46:55] ZoneHawk: He's a cadet though
[7:46:55] Crimson__Badger: how is he is the wrong though? he was punched so he should be able to use up to a baton in retaliation right?
[7:46:56] Yevonai: Victimizes himself
[7:46:56] cheebah710: well HypeDisguise
[7:46:56] WEB3curry_: just cooked
[7:46:57] nimbleop: susention but not fired
[7:46:57] slymox: JUSTICE4JOHNSON
[7:46:58] taffletv: Slacks said they ate dealing with the other 2 as well
[7:46:58] MsKibitzer: All of them are in the wrong getting personal vs RP in the arguing. J, K, Ramee, Slacks..
[7:47:00] SephirothPhenyx: LOLOLOLOL SNUCK IT IN
[7:47:00] Mogvvai4Sale: It's how he handled and is handling the scenario professionally
[7:47:01] MatmatikOfficial: Cornwood is late for his meeting lol
[7:47:01] Fozenoh: @Minokawa_82 "...wrong, chat"
[7:47:02] microplasticbrain: she began to WHAT his ass?
[7:47:02] jacksmithcje: i don‚Äôt think he realised he could have taken the small L tbh
[7:47:03] Buster_Buster: think he needs to understand that he didn't get fired for the use of force
[7:47:03] EclecticMotives: its just RP LUL
[7:47:03] MakiWind: he just need to admit it he did wrong and i dont think Slacks wanted fire from the start.
[7:47:04] Mic_Stargazer: @GorSTL with the fired/grandam thing he mentions to slacks when he asks and heavily implied it was a push to talk misclick, like he was saying it to chat
[7:47:04] CraigsWorldHD: @huhddee iam mad cause u can't understand what he's saying
[7:47:05] typicaluser777: He's trying to save himself
[7:47:05] StickOfMilk: cornwoods such a good listener
[7:47:06] crowgoes: He was definitely in the wrong but seems like a suspension could have worked instead of just out right fired
[7:47:06] SavageTarzan: WideHardo lock us up
[7:47:07] 2F1lthyCS: in the past
[7:47:07] Hero_g: 5 daps max
[7:47:08] spongefrank: All i hear is whining, instead of just taking it up and try to go forward
[7:47:08] SephirothPhenyx: GETS BEAT AND WANTS TO SMASH
[7:47:09] sunding88: Problem now is also that. he goes around speaking to everyone trying to redo the captains decision.... why bother with that twice if they take him back and stuff happen again..... dont stir the pot like that. accept the decision. leave it be.
[7:47:09] Sizzlaa: lol
[7:47:09] JasonVoorhees71: he fkd up, end of bruv lol
[7:47:10] ShadyMashX: every 1 is wrong but he only got fired
[7:47:11] rhaziaa: The problem is that he doesn't realize he's wrong.  Fighting K was obviously against the rules, and the fact that Johnson doesn't understand this shows he isn't up to the task.
[7:47:11] Syn1285: hes cuasing shit when hes al;ready fired
[7:47:11] my69thaccount: #JUSTICE4JOHNSON
[7:47:11] JPhilly1205: he honestly doesn‚Äôt think he lied to slacks.
[7:47:11] RexPappa: the issue is the firing, give him 9 fkn DAPs, making hang on for his life, but dont fire the guy for one bad incident
[7:47:12] icephrogg: its all because he lied and hes stil lying about not saying grandma etc when he did
[7:47:13] slomojosh: theres also an area for coaching BUT him doubling down doesn‚Äôt give room for help cause he‚Äôs so aggro
[7:47:13] PandaNomsBamboo: Johnson got rocked and lost his mind lol
[7:47:14] codezman: Just tell him straight up
[7:47:14] SephirothPhenyx: LULZZZZ
[7:47:14] soosmaz74: well it became about the fighting because he is upset why they are taking the side of the person who aassualted him
[7:47:14] eyeoin: Siobhan..
[7:47:14] suoicil: literally just had to say "Im sorry it wont happen again."
[7:47:14] 2F1lthyCS: the present is now
[7:47:15] thebigchinballs: I dont think he knows that he was lying just forgot
[7:47:16] Toluen090: It was explained that way to him that the fighting is separate but omitting in the statement is the lying
[7:47:16] HeyMeghan: he really was fired for lack of integrity.
[7:47:16] Valail: He needs to stop talking lol only hurting himself
[7:47:16] Jomuse92: her beginning to beat his ass statement was kinda funny no lie lmao
[7:47:16] LewdMoonCake: @Yevonai, yea mans got the record for getting his ass beat as a cop
[7:47:18] HibikiHikariVT: you're gonna have to tell him no?
[7:47:18] infintitedream: Again not about the fighting. it‚Äôs about the leaving out information they are worried about
[7:47:19] thysiastery: womp womp
[7:47:19] slymox: sounds familiar
[7:47:19] Lord__Gen: Slacks knew he was in the wrong, but still wanted to help him out. But.....Johnson isn't willing to treat it as a learning experience
[7:47:20] magnets_: OMEGALAUGHING
[7:47:21] sirbombabba: facts spit king
[7:47:23] 2F1lthyCS: You are fine
[7:47:23] SephirothPhenyx: LMFAOOOOOO
[7:47:24] magnets_: this dude is lost
[7:47:24] RhalArda: honestly the way he's acting, the fact he doesn't get it, just adds more support to why he was fired.
[7:47:25] spicyville: CHAT SLOW DOWN I CANT READ EVERYTHING
[7:47:27] WEB3curry_: anger problems
[7:47:27] ItsSloth24: @Gachiguru He ommitted alot of important details from his statements, specifically the parts the show he attacked K after steping back bandaging and taking his vest off, thats a half truth which slacks equates to a lie.
[7:47:27] SephirothPhenyx: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
[7:47:27] SelectBttnGames: @SavageTarzan True!  DankL
[7:47:27] L_a_z_o_r: essaying
[7:47:27] Connorbrow: TimmayHS For the fight, yes. But not admitting fault and being argumentative to the investigation is what got him fired.
[7:47:28] 2F1lthyCS: have a good time
[7:47:29] GYNECHIATRIST: YEAHHH you're not getting anywhere with him LULE
[7:47:29] ilmarcusil: @EsfandTV you can just tell him what would just said
[7:47:30] Bright_san: hes a villain now.
[7:47:31] Sizzlaa: jdcrD2 me too
[7:47:31] taraannee: slacks literally said to johnson ‚Äúyou went from being the victim to being the aggressor‚Äù so he just wants to play victim at this point..
[7:47:33] fugglesnaff: the point is intent. From his view he wasn't intending to omit anything he just skipped to the point. In slacks and Ruby's view he intentionally omitted details. That's why it's difficult

[7:47:34] huhddee: I'm very humble
[7:47:34] M__Wolfe: Derollo directly lied to a CO, Johnson omitted info. Omission is not lying. Derollo is still a SO amd Johnson is fired. Johnsons only route is sueing
[7:47:36] SephirothPhenyx: KEKW
[7:47:36] MsKibitzer: umm
[7:47:36] josh1832000: I don‚Äôt see why he was fired that‚Äôs what dap points are for

[7:47:37] Iron_Bjorn: so humble
[7:47:37] sirbombabba: GOAT
[7:47:37] AndreSays: How is he fired over forgetting details tho??
[7:47:38] 2F1lthyCS: make it make sense
[7:47:38] Switchblade142: @icephrogg But why is it not possible that he just misremembered that?
[7:47:39] stuey_drake: ye the way he is doubling down is wrong but he is a cadet! he should be put on a short lead for a bit and have to go round with another officer. not fired

[7:47:55] comrade_raptor: sure he is in the wrong but he shouldnt have been fired
[7:47:55] Kaisenjin: @isaacnewton5 That's a good point
[7:47:55] PacGamer: Classic phone call out
[7:47:56] P4K_Little: he has blame in the situation as well as the other officers. if he was fired for that and not because of him challenging and elevating the issue with his superior officer then it‚Äôs kinda fucked tbh
[7:47:57] 2F1lthyCS: Hes good
[7:47:57] Liloxcj: @ItsSloth24 that does not warrant be firing ffs
[7:47:58] GYNECHIATRIST: peepoRun
[7:47:58] BeerRun204: He did not follow his use of force, he acted like he is allowed to street fight as a cop and that's not allowed
[7:47:58] iMoore_: victim mentality
[7:47:59] AnusReaktorMan: @esfandtv slacks told him ‚Äúi was gonna give u 4 daps & 24hr suspension but u haven‚Äôt said sorry, or taken accountability & ur doubling down so you‚Äôre fired‚Äù
[7:47:59] VanityR: other 2 were covering themselves for not de-escalating either, and slacks took their statements over his regarding 'integrity'
[7:47:59] ZCrimes: he doesn't seem to get he did wrong, but he serious roleplay, he can't admit/say the punch at him was a mistake, they rp'd it out as intentional.
[7:47:59] Takuto819: @ItsSloth24 problem he said he needed.... to put a quick statement in by McNulity at the incident
[7:48:00] Lordrune13: yeah the 2 cops that were there are in the wrong too

[7:48:04] EthanGinger20: lookUp
[7:48:04] clemson0607: The problem is‚Ä¶ he literally can‚Äôt be hired back because of his lack of understanding why he can‚Äôt do this.. he is a loose cannon.

[7:49:58] claptil: I think it's not enough to be fired
[7:49:58] Jerti_: you dont need to solve ll problwms
[7:49:58] rhaziaa: All Johnson has to say is "I was in the wrong when I fought back against K"
[7:49:59] danmago89: He just keeps on lying
[7:50:00] evilmoose__: @esfandtv Explain why to him.
[7:50:01] GYNECHIATRIST: i kinda get where slacks is coming from now LULE
[7:50:01] sirbombabba: I see both sides but Jhonson isnt wrong imo
[7:50:01] JasonVoorhees71: he lied twice when slax asked him about it
[7:50:01] neptunesstorms: thats not enough to be fired though LUL
[7:50:01] SavageTarzan: Classic
[7:50:02] s0ggybreads: it unfortunate but its conduct unbecoming of an officer
[7:50:02] Gachiguru: @EsfandTV he got punished for sbs
[7:50:03] Aerodith: but should it be enough?
[7:50:03] Joongi_: TRUE OMEGALUL
[7:50:04] Neekapkilla: You were in the wrong at the base and should be fired
[7:50:04] vozalth: Lie by ommission
[7:50:04] ilmarcusil: but is it enough to be fired?
[7:50:04] PoisonDart11: @taraannee exactly, people dont understand that he wasnt even supposed to be fired kekw
[7:50:05] MsKibitzer: Say that to him
[7:50:05] vmark99: Tell him that and ask him to apologize
[7:50:07] TikiSmash: yeah :/
[7:50:08] Karter6t: Sheriff time to hit him with the hard truth
[7:50:09] jacksmithcje: I just think he didn‚Äôt realise he had an out and messed him up
[7:50:09] jburke23: It's pretty clear he was wrong and then the fact he doesn't own up to it is why he was fired
[7:50:09] magnets_: YEP
[7:50:10] MsKibitzer: give him tough love and be a friend
[7:50:10] spongefrank: Just tell him
[7:50:10] DrWetbone: Johnson from old dept he doesn‚Äôt get that cops take it on the chin more now
[7:50:11] Gr1zzz: wehat he did was wrong but the situation was handle as badly as possible
[7:50:11] 903gaming: guilty till proven innocent...
[7:50:11] Eeyley: @imbruhhmann yeah that's a part of the joke haha
[7:50:12] Minokawa_82: confront him
[7:50:12] EnochBlanche: he did tell you "to the best of his knowledge"\
[7:50:12] Lord__Gen: exactly
[7:50:12] EclecticMotives: then why does it matter?
[7:50:12] Mogvvai4Sale: mhm tru
[7:50:14] krosswynd: but that‚Äôs a dap not firing offence
[7:50:15] MericanRoundEye: he almost did
[7:50:15] nimbleop: He did, But he shouldn't be fired
[7:50:15] KMGP_Outlaw: need a second chance here somehow
[7:50:15] Leafyerick: @EsfandTV He doesn't understand
[7:50:15] bajbae: i still don't understand what he lied about
[7:50:15] PandaNomsBamboo: yep lying as a cop will get you fired and take accountability and say sorry
[7:50:16] 1CaptainRedBeard1: If he took some accountability he could legit get his job back.
[7:50:16] ScyThE619: that IS the problem
[7:50:16] Rapanui_: @EsfandTV Johnson ADMITTED he was wrong for attacking K
[7:50:16] HulkDiesel: @esfandtv bro so tell him that
[7:50:17] zilaprime: Sheriff shit
[7:50:17] Alkemiee: yea, playing pure victim
[7:50:18] theblackdog808: giving me a migraine
[7:50:19] permacool: hes lying to himself Sadge @EsfandTV
[7:50:20] iMoore_: 100
[7:50:21] danmago89: Cant save them all Big C...
[7:50:21] ilmarcusil: enough to be fired but NOT suspended?
[7:50:22] AnusReaktorMan: @esfandtv slacks told him ‚Äúi was gonna give u 4 daps & 24hr suspension but u haven‚Äôt said sorry, or taken accountability & ur doubling down so you‚Äôre fired‚Äù
[7:50:22] 1CaptainRedBeard1: But man...
[7:50:22] sweetbabymango: is this johnsons character speaking or him?
[7:50:23] clemson0607: Slack made the right call‚Ä¶ tough decisions were made‚Ä¶ he won‚Äôt accept it‚Ä¶ people will move on.
[7:50:23] Kylmao: hes acting like a child lmao bro needs to learn to take accountability
[7:50:23] AndreSays: How is he not taking accountability. They were trying to have a man to man fight I don't why that's such an issue
[7:50:24] 2F1lthyCS: it is what it is. let him go. you arernt a real cop its a game.
[7:50:24] Gachiguru: If he gets fired, the other two cops need to be fired
[7:50:24] gimmedacheekz: CAP
[7:50:25] HogballTV: CORNWOODS accountability is OP
[7:50:25] 2F1lthyCS: lol
[7:50:26] Syn1285: he sounds totlly different
[7:50:26] magnets_: slacks made up his mind to fire him in the meeting with him once he realized johnson wasn't taking any accountaility
[7:50:26] Wintyer2: with Slacks its not about what he said its about how he said it the aditude and lack of care and remorse of what he did after he did it
[7:50:27] viperz152: idk if he gets ooc that if he just takes the punishment he can come back the struggles is creating a divide
[7:50:28] SurelyBaked: he's in wrong because he's trying to have a job that is held to a specific standard and the fact that he's not willing to hold himself accountable is a character flaw they don't want in the PD
[7:50:28] MDM4ever1986HD: @albakrut he punched Mr K and now he's complaining to PD
[7:50:29] MrBASins: he shouldn't have done what he did
[7:50:29] Mic_Stargazer: He was wrong and the officers on scene were wrong. If "lying" isthe issue, which is really just MISREMEMBERING fire all three then
[7:50:31] StevenMcBurn: dude just has a bad memory but can't admit it lol
[7:50:31] BiZARGoN: i honestly dont think he intentionally lied by omission, he just used his own words to describe the altercation
[7:50:31] P4K_Little: why not suggest he take accountability @esfandtv for the fight and for the argument with slacks ?
[7:50:31] revengeitself: he also left out information during his statement like the taking off his vest part
[7:50:31] verysoggytoasts: I think he thinks he did nothing wrong
[7:50:33] PoisonDart11: @krosswynd he doubled down, he wasnt gonna be fired
[7:50:34] vicious_pen: wtf with his voice?
[7:50:35] Nerdversity: I mean its crazy, Ssasb was getting destroyed during this, when people didnt understand it was all about ACCOUNTABILITY @EsfandTV
[7:50:36] masontheartist: ye you're right; you should see if you can tell him why he was in the wrong; but he needs to cool off
[7:50:37] quaylewastaken: SLACKS  LIED THAT MR K REPORTED HIM. AND HE WAS DOING TRAINING DAY RP. AND IT WAS NOTHING SERIOUS
[7:50:37] HeyMeghan: @raytona650 if his RP is that good he should be able to RP through this.
[7:50:37] Cwarush: All he had to say was he saw red when K punched him and he doesn't remember what he said he just fought back
[7:50:38] Sizzlaa: knxHIT beansHood
[7:50:39] spicyville: AAAA opinions
[7:50:39] imbruhhmann: @SarahFlare i aint seen it yet if he did
[7:50:41] 2F1lthyCS: all things are fun with good intent on helping others mental and life
[7:50:41] M__Wolfe: I hope Johnson wins his case so something might get Slacks and Ruth out of their positions.
[7:50:42] soosmaz74: i mean he got assaulted in front of everyone and no one said anything so he is upset
[7:50:42] SarahFlare: being in a place of leadership fucking sucks because sometimes you just have to suck it up and take the L and apologize/take accountability.
[7:50:42] Bright_san: he'll turn to crime
[7:50:43] taraannee: @poisondart11 YUPPP but ppl just like him so they‚Äôre assuming shit & it sucks bc they‚Äôre giving slacks shit when slacks was so upset that he had no choice but to fire him
[7:50:44] Rapanui_: Why does everyone keep ignoring Johnson admitting attacking L was wrong, and saying he doesn't take accountability?
[7:50:45] honestnandaba: he doesn‚Äôt seem to realize the threat has to be active to warrants reaction
[7:50:46] 2F1lthyCS: just start from here
[7:50:46] jinnytolls: He really needs help in terms of RPing out this situation
[7:50:48] GamingWithGardenGnomes: I've been somewhat following it since it happened and I just can't see anyone in the right here. Everyone's kinda dropped the ball here
[7:50:48] WhatIsTOS: esfandKiss esfandBust CORNMODE
[7:50:48] Nsan7: I like his character but he missed up and hard
[7:50:48] iJerrBear: Johnson omited facts when he was giving York his statement and is wrong for fighting with K when K didnt continue attacking after the punch
[7:50:49] heavyd834: he would've been ok if he just admitted he was wrong and apologized and took the suspension
[7:50:50] Silvertap: mAn i was watching the video of his firing, and it is BS
[7:50:53] 2F1lthyCS: everyday is a new day
[7:50:53] neptunesstorms: slacks did lie about mr k reporting him
[7:50:55] taraannee: HE DIDNT CHAT OMG
[7:50:55] Takuto819: so you take accountability of being a liar lul. I think he felt his character was attacked i guess.
[7:50:55] RicoLoco52: @Switchblade142 Then it's still Slacks' decision in the end. and it isn't just the K incident.
[7:50:55] davideil: Chatting
[7:50:56] jinnytolls: He really needs help in terms of RPing out this situation @EsfandTV
[7:50:57] TheDaghda: @s0stin he did to johnson
[7:50:57] laniatx09: He did
[7:50:58] Bright_san: slacks is a bit too serious to "lie"
[7:51:00] MakiWind: yeah if he did that he probally wouldnt get fired
[7:51:00] KMGP_Outlaw: this is the perfect Cornwood mobile
[7:51:01] AndreSays: Mr K didn't report him
[7:51:01] rhaziaa: Slacks even told Johnson he could come back if he can prove he can learn that he was wrong.
[7:51:02] my69thaccount: SLACKS LIED PEOPLE DIED
[7:51:02] MsKibitzer: he did lie about Mr K filing a complaint lol. We are watching it.

[7:51:32] Mic_Stargazer: He 100% lied about Mr. K filing a report. THat's a lie. Slacks will admit it
[7:51:32] TheRealTarrjue: It's true he needs accountability but also could a case be made that no DAPS straight to fired indicates a gap in training and guidance by leadership?
[7:51:32] Lordrune13: Johnson fired 100% bs
[7:51:33] k1nneDECIR: I love Captain Slacks. He gave him a chance brotherman. He did the right thing. o7

[7:51:39] SarahFlare: yeah fucking sucks
[7:51:40] quaylewastaken: its the way he police
[7:51:41] MsHollyyy: @EsfandTV Yeah but the thing is is that Mr. K validated Johnson and even said he had witnesses to prove against the 2 cops but Slacks still went with their say
[7:51:41] 1CaptainRedBeard1: Yeah
[7:51:41] Vikairius: This proves why an HR department is needed
[7:51:42] JPhilly1205: @esfandtv do you think he should have been fired for that?
[7:51:42] taraannee: ppl were going into ssaabs chat & giving him OOC shit it was ridiculous
[7:51:42] jakqc: yea he should of just cop stacked at mrpd then he wouldbe been fine OMEGALAUGHING
[7:51:42] magnets_: YEP he has no accountability
[7:51:43] BigBlue31: but the other officers that did nothing and lied won't get punished
[7:51:44] Firsthandpower: 100% true Johnson is in the wrong
[7:51:44] infintitedream: @esfandtv you are building on cases and him omitting truth is going to hurt the PD
[7:51:45] Sizzlaa: oh
[7:51:45] vicious_pen: well Esfand in fairness most cops in real life aren't like Andrews.  and they're  not like this PD.
[7:51:45] Talker100: Johnson keeps playing the victim card
[7:51:45] HolyNoley: Being mad at slacks is rp chatter meta
[7:51:46] EthanGinger20: @Firehead94 kekw true

[7:51:55] soosmaz74: so he needs to take accountability for defending himself
[7:51:55] vmark99: But have a talk and explain why he is in the wrong
[7:51:56] Itztehginger: it doesn‚Äôt matter if slacks just went by what he was told, the way he said it was completely wrong. if k didn‚Äôt file a complaint, don‚Äôt say he did
[7:51:56] underkeeper621: wait who getting fired just got back?
[7:51:57] nimbleop: he did it too himself soo

[7:52:29] clutchbucket_: what hes not recirprocating is that he was never told he was giving a statement. the girl said it in a casual conversation manner asking "what happen" thats why he didnt lie, nor go to an extensive detail. thats what ive gathered anyway, and where the confusion is resonating from
[7:52:29] TryggrTrix: The police department is suffering from paralysis by analysis
[7:52:31] Kelborn: whether he filed a complaint or not is irrelevant, he wasnt fired over the complaint anyway

[7:52:49] PoisonDart11: he took 0 accountability, he aint coming back
[7:52:50] HeyMeghan: @jasonvoorhees71 and was even gonna let him off with just daps. then Johnson screamed and blamed others still. and he still doesn‚Äôt get it.
[7:52:51] SephirothPhenyx: IM EDIBLES
[7:52:52] 2F1lthyCS: fuck yeah
[7:52:53] vicious_pen: I think something like this should be worked out in OOC chat
[7:52:54] pakss_14: dose he don"t know or in rp he dosen't understands it?
[7:52:54] AndreSays: I never watched Johnson stream but I like his character. He was having fun with Mr K by getting into a man to man fist fight. Only because the other cops wanted to be serious @esfandtv

[7:53:05] ZuldeadTV: if he doesn't get it, he'll get fired again eventually
[7:53:06] SurelyBaked: the only way he can come back is if he takes accountability to the captains, literally the only way
[7:53:06] Mic_Stargazer: @Kelborn it 100% matters. Integrity. Honesty. LYING, which is why he was fired. Slacks LIED abotu the report. Was it intentional? No, the same way all 3 officers misremembering the situation was unintentinoal.
[7:53:06] RhalArda: lol
[7:53:07] Lord__Gen: Honestly its a good life irl lesson. How do you put that on someone though
[7:53:07] Cwarush: He got dapped for the fight, he got fired for lying on his statement about the fight. Its as simple as that

[7:53:08] masontheartist: He has to realize what he did. And why it's imortant
[7:53:09] SarahFlare: Anger Management, therapy I think is probably a start to come back
[7:53:09] SavageTarzan: HUH

[7:53:09] Toastedgamer03: honestly him becoming a crim could be good for rp also
[7:53:09] heartsonlysoren: Crane is the best
[7:53:10] HogballTV: @EsfandTV He needs to reapply in a few weeks and go back thru academy
[7:53:10] Jrey000: I think the only has two diffrent paths... either apologize and understand what he could do better or make a new characeter
[7:53:11] Peetus_: He needs to admit he messed up at the least @EsfandTV
[7:53:11] bertacharm: OMEGALUL
[7:53:11] Firsthandpower: Slacks just wanted to give him a chance to own up and tell the truth. He can't come back if he is stubborn and not admitting his faults

[7:53:46] Nerdversity: @EsfandTV you can only do so much as ESFAND and CORNWOOD man.
[7:53:48] josh1832000: what you should do is give them two scenarios one the wrong way and won the correct way to handle that issue
[7:53:48] Sizzlaa: sgreyCoffee sgreyNeutral

[7:54:00] Leafyerick: @EsfandTV Tell her she looks like Ripley in Aliens 3
[7:54:00] Mic_Stargazer: The "lying" was misremembering, it wasn't lying intentionally.
[7:54:01] albakrut: If the management cannot clearly explain what the employee‚Äôs mistake is, so that he understands, and does not give him paid leave after 2 attempted murders. The problem for me is them

[7:54:12] StormiNyan: Pog missions
[7:54:14] ryothfps: The "lying" was misremembering, it wasn't lying intentionally.
[7:54:15] Silvertap: In resume Jhonson omited in more than just one report some aspects of how he react to provocations. Slackes believes that is lying or falsifying reportas and feels that is dangerous to PD, he believes that is uncurable... i disagree but i am just a viewer lol
[7:54:17] randyrandoe: He needs some tough love
[7:54:18] HeyMeghan: @albakrut they DID he didn‚Äôt LISTEN!
[7:54:18] Crimson__Badger: can you explain more why he was in the wrong?
[7:54:19] vicious_pen: well frankly the whole K hit him and he should use a baton instead of hitting him thing seems completely whacko to me
[7:54:23] 2F1lthyCS: its all the same. and needs to be
[7:54:23] SavageTarzan: PepoG
[7:54:24] TheRealTarrjue: @esfandtv could you convince leadership they dropped the ball on gudiing and training johnson and that's why he made the mistakes he did?
[7:54:24] DaeTonator: In all honesty though, it's a good RP to have Johnson not being able to understand the PD integrity and not knowing what he did wrong. When things are too linear it gets boring and this is muddle and complex. It's a good drama and it even drags in chatters. Chatters that are so invested and don't know how to stay out of drama themselves. This RP is drama inception.
[7:54:26] Alkemiee: yea
[7:54:27] DevilDogTash: you also aren‚Äôt really giving your perspective. you just say ‚Äúyou all don‚Äôt understand‚Äù so explain your perspective

[7:55:02] guilt_: Of course that's your contention. You're a first year grad student. You just finished some Marxian historian, Pete Garrison prob'ly, and so naturally that's what you believe until next month when you get to James Lemon and get convinced that Virginia and Pennsylvania were strongly entrepreneurial and capitalist back in 1740. That'll last until sometime in your second year, then you'll be in here regurgitating Gordon Wood about the Pre-revolutionary utopia.
[7:55:04] RicoLoco52: oh, god Bobby
[7:55:04] hereforff9: youre allowed to make mistakes, but you cant make a mistake, not take accountability, get angry about it, tell somebody else its their problem, and then expect nothing to happen. very unfair way to put it, but yeah

[7:55:31] GamingWithGardenGnomes: I do question why it wasnt a suspension prior to a dismissal tho. Like if they'd given him 72 hours after the we need to talk conversation. Take this time, review your actions, and we will discuss this.

[7:56:07] PoisonDart11: @thedragqu33n it was supposed to be a suspension, but he doubled down after and so he was fired.

[9:56:27] DaelinT: On the other hand, they do want crims to have fun, so like I get that they have to be a bit lenient at times.
[9:56:31] slight621: @JimmyJelqer Then go away.
[9:56:32] Recon_XoX: @Surragard Same
[9:56:32] Alkemiee: @Afterman_ ahh, ok
[9:56:32] Vertigo_GG: @JimmyJelqer how mant times you want to say this shit?

[9:57:07] Leafyerick: @EsfandTV He might not be confident and think it's bad RP
[9:57:08] MrActivated: i guess its not very RP
[9:57:08] Berserake: Maybe it doesnt work without sim?
[9:57:08] Afterman_: maybe the g6 stuff is connected to their sim card? no idea how that works
[9:57:08] WayILive: he probably didnt have sim or didnt know what to do
[9:57:09] SlurpyJones: That phone doesn't have his info on it -1
[9:57:11] ManySadPandas: Do they have to have their Sim card?

[9:57:16] Toastedgamer03: since g6 truck probably needs to log into g6 which mr k needed a tablet or a phone with a sim card

[9:57:45] Vertigo_GG: What're you eating @EsfandTV snack cam
[9:57:47] sevenevilmuffins: track my iphone
[9:57:48] 55Hoes: hey mister K haters
[9:57:49] bertacharm: Hmm
[9:57:49] Cheexur: I mean twatter is different than locating a truck
[9:57:49] DaelinT: when Mr K was doing it, it was to sign into a job. Its different
[9:57:53] WayILive: the crims expect them to do that, hence taking phones
[9:57:54] Syneios: Was just testing that PD coquette mod.. If the suspension is lowered it will turn into a drifter.
[9:57:57] dudemanbroo: SIM card scuff!!!
[9:57:59] SneakyxOctopus: Jenova?
[9:58:01] the_main_burt: true
[9:58:02] wutangstyle613: those are 2 wildly different scrips tho... twitter and tracking

[9:58:08] Recon_XoX: sniffthenewchatter
[9:58:10] omn___i: no one hates mr K here Maj
[9:58:11] chatatonic: log in in character
[9:58:13] SlurpyJones: Why would that random phone have a g6 vehicle tracker app pre installed
[9:58:14] vmjama: @daelint there‚Äôs being lenient and there‚Äôs having everything crim‚Äôs way. I‚Äôve been watching crims a lot, its getting boring as they IC do the crimes knowing they‚Äôll easily get away.
[9:58:17] agnosticbishops: Sounds like a salad? Hmm
[9:58:17] RnG_Qwik: But the tracking app is connected to a sim or actual phone not via login right?
[9:58:18] infintitedream: G6 just needs to be better with their SOPs
[9:58:19] zilaprime: And now I fall asleep to Cornwood, as it should be. Night chat.
[9:58:21] gadget_t: It's up to them if they think it's bad RP
[9:58:22] woolfdesign: Mr K is awesome.
[9:58:23] MrBASins: maybe it a underground thing and some gruppie 6 drivers are a part of it
[9:58:24] Leafyerick: @DaelinT It's not different. Phones are tied to the person currently using it not whoever's it was
[9:58:26] slight621: Mr. K helps make the RP
[9:58:28] docterstrange_: if the vitcim sits in your car it will be so easy to track him
[9:58:29] Cheexur: locating a truck is power gaming twatter is just banter
[9:58:30] SurelyBaked: esfands chat likes 99.9% of RPers
[9:58:31] this_is_justin: Mr. K my beloved esfandL
[9:58:32] TheGodmother: mr K is awesome 4WeirdBuff
[9:58:33] Prometheus_alGhul: it can be like logging in to a an app that tracks your phone
[9:58:34] ilmarcusil: I hate Mr K UltraMad
[9:58:34] bertacharm: i guess you could argue both wifi shits
[9:58:35] tonecomms: RP wise, they both would just be "log in to your account"
[9:58:35] ToyzinN_: @DaelinT yes, but he used it to post on twatter
[9:58:37] Vious10: K = RP
[9:58:37] LogicWeasel: Speaking of Mr K RP @EsfandTV https://clips.twitch.tv/PoliteHonestOilResidentSleeper-2HOh9NXuCu9bPAig
[9:58:37] Zarniwooper: Timo was using the phone to twat without a SIM at prison all the time before he got one.

[9:58:42] jd2881: Yall need to set up some fake groppe 6 drops.
[9:58:45] jwells302: they make the corvette faster yet ?
[9:58:46] Sylist13: Mr K is an RP creating machine
[9:58:47] skuff3d: thats how i usually play it when i get robbed. If they don't take my phone it is fair game
[9:58:48] 33jona: crunch is wt makes me watch mukbangs
[9:58:49] WayILive: the grinders are just getting grinded a bit :)
[9:58:50] Berserake: Is he eating corn
[9:58:50] 55Hoes: kebunWTF kebunWTF kebunWTF kebunWTF
[9:58:51] crowgoes: The crims expect them to do that. They know they only have a short time before they track on someelses phone
[9:58:52] Wintyer2: @TacoBellKing yes
[9:58:55] wutangstyle613: yall have probably the only balanced Cop POV chats tbh :P
[9:58:56] Geek_Mode_Gaming: i hate Mr.K he keeps stealing all the ladies
[9:58:57] slight621: @TacoBellKing All day today
[9:58:59] Athbreith: @EsfandTV Whose your favorite cop on each shift if you had to choose one peepoCute
[9:59:10] superbear922: @esfandtv I've been watching every day after work from like 4pm texas time to when I fall asleep. I watched back in the day too. When you said earlier that you're sorry for the secondhand stress I felt that, but that's part of it and I absolutely love the RP. Keep it up even if it's hard. It'd amazing.
[9:59:10] KronnNZ: wouldant have MFA on your phone :D
[9:59:11] usersoda: TheIlluminati
[9:59:15] Recon_XoX: No problem with that at all
[9:59:15] MsKibitzer: Were all adults.. different opinions lol.. lets debate civily.. without insult
[9:59:17] chatatonic: nah they dumb
[9:59:18] MrBASins: unless they are apart of it
[9:59:19] ToyzinN_: yea they just log into the security website
[9:59:20] msdeell: if it has the capability , it's good rp
[9:59:24] sevenevilmuffins: Its literally just Track my iphone
[9:59:24] DaelinT: @vmjama I remember after one chase, people in chat told Esfand the crims were confused why the cops didn't chase longer or start shooting.
[9:59:27] cjdudeman: It's like signing into your AAA on another phone to get car info
[9:59:31] Gachiguru: go to the cells ReallyMad
[9:59:33] Recon_XoX: @AsTroMaN432  sniffthenewchatter

[9:59:35] msdeell: yep
[9:59:36] wutangstyle613: in the scope of what does the SCRIPT allow
[9:59:37] JumpShotHD: i think they need their personal phone sim to track the work truck
[9:59:46] SharkzGG_: @DaelinT that happens often still tbh haha
[9:59:46] coldan01: @AsTroMaN432 RIPBOZO
[9:59:48] Mr_Jaffs: @AsTroMaN432 fuck off
[9:59:48] bumstothesky: you avoided a headache though. the crims wouldve complained, cuz they took their phones in order to prevent that
[9:59:49] infintitedream: I don‚Äôt think the crims like losing you right away
[9:59:51] ellzztv: totally agree more chases and robberies
[9:59:58] Gachiguru: go cop stack in the cells and take a break ReallyMad
[10:00:01] wutangstyle613: like does the script for the twitter n stuff even work the same as the one for tracking
[10:00:01] gadget_t: That's up to the RPer.
[10:00:07] tonecomms: "log in to your account"
[10:00:07] skuff3d: they can, they have to go back to the store and buy a new phone AND sim card
[10:00:08] jwells302: I think the 4.0 update has made it so much better both ways RP and gameplay
[10:00:09] afkbrb: @AsTroMaN432 MODS crush his balls
[10:00:10] TTLcute: its not even bad rp. they are just logging into their work app from another device.
[10:00:13] SharkzGG_: @bumstothesky crims will complain about everything anyways though :)
[10:00:13] Spartoriius: up to the rper
[10:00:14] Baileh_: bigrob22STURRIDGE
[10:00:15] Helemok: @AsTroMaN432 nah

[10:00:17] jwells302: where gameplay isn‚Äôt OP
[10:00:19] skuff3d: the sim card is what makes it weird
[10:00:19] dudemanbroo: bringing a victim into an active chase. PD should be able to track gruppe 6 vehicles with the same app. @esfandtv
[10:00:20] GrimCucu: you can track cars on any phone lmao
[10:00:20] irascible23: New car Pog

[10:00:26] IIIIllIlll: @AsTroMaN432 NOPERS
[10:00:27] sevenevilmuffins: I keep an air tag in my car for that reason
[10:00:27] Toastedgamer03: i was thinking that it was they needed to use the g6 app to track the car and i remember mr k needed a tablet or phone with sim for logging in
[10:00:28] Prometheus_alGhul: yea i see it as logging in to an app
[10:00:29] JoeSizzle7: IF you remember your password for the app but we all use saved passwords
[10:00:30] blackmar14: chat has clearly never bought a new phone in their lives
[10:00:31] infintitedream: some chatters are just way to real with this shit
[10:00:32] Leafyerick: Probably just didn't feel comfortable doing it or there was scuff
[10:00:33] KronnNZ: @tonecomms MFA? bank app wouldnt be just secured witha  password :P
[10:00:33] mr_turnips: @AsTroMaN432 N OMEGALUL
[10:00:33] Avery579: I mean, wouldn't a cop IRL do that so they could find the vehicle?
[10:00:33] LogicWeasel: I guess that G6 guy didn't want his truck back?  4Shrug
[10:00:35] Simplechoices: Eat faster
[10:00:35] xBoozex: Clearly lo-jack and air tags don't exist
[10:00:39] Afterman_: yeah maybe pd needs to be able to track g6
[10:00:42] hg_redemption: still test driving this car?
[10:00:46] MrActivated: he also said that he dropped so they never stole it omE
[10:00:47] omn___i: who cares
[10:00:47] JumpShotHD: yeah cause thats their new phone you handed him your phone with no sim in it so it wont work right
[10:00:49] DaelinT: @JoeSizzle7 I have 5 different passwords for work, all different, I remember them all
[10:00:50] KronnNZ: maybe they can make tracking tags or something?
[10:00:52] permacool: THATS WHAT IM SAYING
[10:00:53] Orbilion: YEP

[10:46:00] Vizumn: @oofinside Exactly, he just needs more mods. Nobody in their right mind can work this chat 13 hours a day
[10:46:03] Toastedgamer03: it is amazing how we get rentals to help solve the pd car problem, but they are all worse than the cvpi
[10:46:03] Jomuse92: yeah it's rough. My niece's ride-on is more durable at this point
[10:46:06] Kelborn: @EsfandTV the CVPIs are IRL too, I got hit in mine t-bone at an intersection and the car saved my life, other vehicle was in pieces
[10:46:07] TwoHandedBells: ElenaBerry true and real
[10:46:08] Revolt_vR: theyre all shit but they can swap at any time
[10:46:09] Fozenoh: There should also be damage for when they do jumps and shit NODDERS
[10:46:10] Firehead94: Ram bar should be xfering damage to frame instead of engine and other shit
[10:46:11] itsRauzy: but isnt it always the front of the cop hittin the back of the crim
[10:46:11] bobdang07hd: youve been doing the testing no? get it changed
[10:46:13] DatguyBK: this server is 100% tailored for the crims.
[10:46:13] Sizzlaa: pushups complete
[10:46:17] Acebravo_nz: Car -> Bike -> Escape
[10:46:24] TimmayHS: crims have figured out how to escape PD chases, they have a few really good drivers
[10:46:25] Zarniwooper: Crim gameplay needs to be a bit buffed so it makes sense
[10:46:27] StormiNyan: Prayge new whips soon
[10:46:29] OniZetsumei: cops cars should just be livery only
[10:46:30] sirnigelthornberry: Yeah- they need to step in with some updates to reign in crim power
[10:46:31] Afterman_: fuck it start shooting tires
[10:46:35] bluej255: imo i think they nerf cops, that way crims wont cry as much
[10:46:39] DaelinT: @itsRauzy I think this is a good point, the front getting damaged is much worse then the back
[10:46:47] FelipeLLs: KKonaW why not
[10:46:50] pontiicus: lol
[10:46:52] Deviii_: 3 car swaps into a bike swap, just another day on the job Classic
[10:46:52] Afterman_: even if they get warnned multiple times? dang

[10:47:04] avaell_: KKonaW What if they're protesters blocking traffic
[10:47:07] Sillyanne: kkona

[10:47:09] eyeoin: Cornwood's done that
[10:47:09] DonDarbster: what is maple's twitch nam,e?
[10:47:11] Toastedgamer03: @bluej255 i don't think that is it since crims aren't happy with it also
[10:47:14] itsRauzy: @itsRauzy true, but i think the cop front bumper rail is a cosmetic lol it should provide more proteciton
[10:47:19] Zarniwooper: @Foundwars someone just said its unbalanced
[10:47:21] StormiNyan: cmonnn rock time
[10:47:21] Naruto_AMV_from_2007: help me step officer i'm stuck
[10:47:24] neft39157: i feel like if a chase is going for a long time in a g6 truck, there should be a protocol to shoot tires
[10:47:30] Jomuse92: Now it would be funny af to see a crim just get a tire popped and ragdoll out of existence xD
[10:47:35] Sizzlaa: your life is on the line PJSugar moon2SNIFF

[10:51:30] EclecticMotives: Chatting
[10:51:32] Zarniwooper: @Foundwars But if the cops are better, it would make crim gameplay not worth it. They need to be able to escape most of the time.

[10:52:05] DaelinT: @Zarniwooper Shouldn't it be 50/50? at the least?
[10:52:06] Foundwars: Exactly
[10:52:06] MDM4ever1986HD: @Jomuse92 YEP
[10:52:06] AceOfStearns: no, it needs to be balanced
[10:52:06] itsrosellie: the rewards are pretty low right now tbh
[10:52:08] YYZerro: yo @EsfandTV yo chat
[10:52:11] Sizzlaa: cook the product esfandCOPS
[10:52:12] TimmayHS: the risk doesn't seem very high tbh, they have better EVERYTHING
[10:52:13] ArtificialHelix: They don't need to add cop super cars, just add in the EMP
[10:52:13] quaylewastaken: like what theyere doing
[10:52:13] heartsonlysoren: i havent seen many successfull police chases
[10:52:14] fishmeatx: i agree but people need content
[10:52:14] ElDRojo: it should just play out naturally
[10:52:15] LogicWeasel: what's the bigger issue rn,  not enough PD or the cars?  @EsfandTV
[10:52:15] kyleeeeeee_: PD equipment sadly cant keep up @EsfandTV cars esp
[10:52:16] bluej255: more crims=more crying
[10:52:21] Sizzlaa: mayday mayday when is payday
[10:52:22] Galileothe1: no risk all the reward EZ
[10:52:24] emery_steele: they never get caught in chases
[10:52:24] Foundwars: And atm crims can so whatever they want
[10:52:25] Zarniwooper: But you also get slapped with fines like 100k when you get caught
[10:52:27] droksid00: i thought it was about drive and about power?
[10:52:28] MDM4ever1986HD: true
[10:52:30] Ross_McD: Getting caught they have to sit in jail for like 5 mins then they get out
[10:52:32] Afterman_: Afterman_ is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to EsfandTV's community! They've gifted a total of 1 in the channel! 
[10:52:32] RetPaladinBot: @EsfandTV - Afterman_ has gifted 1 Tier 1 subs Pog
[10:52:32] Afterman_: Afterman_ gifted a Tier 1 sub to purus0! 
[10:52:33] Mr_Jaffs: do it
[10:52:33] papadooskie: it should depend on the crims and their strategy and driving ability. in a perfect world like 50/50
[10:52:35] xnightshift2658: Shambles
[10:52:37] TwoHandedBells: based
[10:52:38] SimpOnMyShrimp: Notmuch cash for criminals
[10:52:42] TimmayHS: Just wait another week till they have automatic weapons
[10:52:44] Sillyanne: fines are way too low
[10:52:45] Puns_for_days: Ragestrike he should make a power point about how having the little allamo would be as good as have pie allomode
[10:52:49] DismalShark: I think the penalties, jail time, is kind of insignificant. They probably don't even think about when doing crime
[10:52:49] DrWetbone: even caught criminals get off Scott free so they really should make cops have an advantage
[10:52:53] LogicWeasel: @Zarniwooper  the avg crim gets hit with like 4-7k max in fines
[10:52:54] AGGavin: they gave the PD KiT cars tbh big disadvantage
[10:52:55] Leafyerick: @EsfandTV Biggest thing right now is big crime is limited so you have a scenario where all the big crime is essentially only available to the best/most epxerienced crims
[10:52:56] dreggy69: such little risk its a joke
[10:52:59] Freddiepines: time served WICKED
[10:52:59] Frankendoink: they never paid you for the turbos so you can do whatever u want with em
[10:53:02] Berserake: I dont know why they dont scale the fines over time
[10:53:02] Biggysnipes: not the adoption fine
[10:53:03] Vikairius: Murder and assault is nothing
[10:53:03] Gio_Dtavio: you should take out turbos to prove a point to the city
[10:53:05] Gachiguru: and crims can just have all their cash in their house and have a negative bank balance
[10:53:07] s1cKNation: But the jump is not realistic Kappa
[10:53:08] Taykum64: Fines definitely need to get increased now that people have had jobs for a while
[10:53:08] kyleeeeeee_: ngl u buying those turbos with your own research and money is crazy without u wondering where the regular cruisers be
[10:53:12] Sillyanne: but my 10min BabyRage
[10:53:13] itsRauzy: that adoption fine tho forsenCD
[10:53:14] belgianswaffel: adoption fraud tho lol
[10:53:14] Jomuse92: they can keep complaining RIPBOZO
[10:53:15] Gachiguru: negative bank balance doesnt matter to crims
[10:53:16] Toastedgamer03: "oh no now i gotta just sit in jail and talk to chat for 10 minutes"
[10:53:16] bygodwest: idk stuff is pretty epensive. Radios only last a day and they are 2k each
[10:53:17] Gallantan: 4 hours complaining for 5 min jail
[10:53:19] charminherman: Why do the cop cars get knocked around so easily when you try to box?
[10:53:20] FelipeLLs: essaying
[10:53:20] TimmayHS: oh yea that's the other thing, if you do get one they act like entitled brats, whining in the cell, asking for Ramee lol
[10:53:21] MDM4ever1986HD: you need to find a balance
[10:53:22] krosswynd: @esfandtv you think criminals should be able to do g6 jobs?
[10:53:29] sunding88: @EsfandTV i get the point of going paralell. but... in most chases the same roads are used. why is nobody never setting up at a few "hotspots" ready for spiking as soon as there are pursuits????
[10:53:34] DrWetbone: the advantage cops have is a gun and they can‚Äôt use them
[10:53:34] BattleAlpaca: can you shake that shit in a circle
[10:53:38] LogicWeasel: facts
[10:53:46] hollowrust: nope now doctors

[10:53:54] ihhunt3r: g6 gonna have to start getting police escorts
[10:53:55] sevenevilmuffins: YES
[10:53:56] AceOfStearns: but what does getting caught do at the end of the day? 5 min in jail and $100 big deal they get out and right back to it
[10:53:56] droksid00: can still work VU
[10:54:02] lilbmurph: its 3k an hour

[10:54:14] PsychoJoker: @ihhunt3r its already happened
[10:54:14] sevenevilmuffins: The consequences for crime need to be way higher
[10:54:20] humanhere2: the fines for a reg illegal gun is less than speeding fines lol
[10:54:20] TheEmmorf: Should take out the turbos so its even more obvious the cars arent balanced
[10:54:24] FelipeLLs: essaying
[10:54:25] Gio_Dtavio: i understand that but it's also a video game.
[10:54:28] MahanGM: there is no classification between civs and cirms tho LULW
[10:54:28] quaylewastaken: sarcasms get lost sometimes and most of the time there busting balls
[10:54:28] LogicWeasel: crim side jobs should only be snr buns, tow, or grime.
[10:54:33] PsychoJoker: Jordan Pog Coming in clutch with food
[10:54:37] Sillyanne: that car is uh smoking
[10:54:38] BattleAlpaca: is anyone on that knows samuel jackson
[10:54:38] xnightshift2658: It would prove a pointr
[10:54:40] PicklemanJaro: def should
[10:54:41] friscokris: @sevenevilmuffins agreed. let all society work for criminals
[10:54:41] DaelinT: Not on WL, but in Public the civ jobs pay way better than most crime.
[10:54:43] Foundwars: There is No "comsequence" Part in this whole Thing atm
[10:54:44] Berserake: Take out all the turbos so they can buff all the cars
[10:54:44] Kelborn: there are some viewers who dont understand that you do not HAVE to do crime in GTARP, they act like crime is the only way to make money
[10:54:45] fishmeatx: Just to make a statement
[10:54:45] loudpack2311: take them all but your car
[10:54:48] Gachiguru: crims SHOULD NOT be in tow

[14:41:28] Toastedgamer03: @Erohw666 depends on the area in america you can search it up and you see florida and california at least do take dna of a baby when born

[14:42:26] Erohw666: @Toastedgamer03 That's not how getting DNA works lol... You need a warrant to get the info, if you get arrested for petty theft, they cannot go and search those records for your DNA....
[14:42:27] IanDooleyTV: @Toastedgamer03 That's wild. How does a baby consent to that?
[14:42:51] chillaxinvibes: @Wandering_Ranger that's what i thought so Romanov may not be connected to the kidnapping (or been kindapped?)  i'm just confused.  LOL
