[1:29:54] neonsloths: idk i think serializing everything  also makes rp be hindered as well
[1:30:00] nickgmiller: it should probably take more time to take out a turbo
[1:30:00] reydedark: they need to remove turbos all together it's creating a problem that shouldn't exist
[1:30:03] jollypnda: I would agree but there should also be a why to alter it.

[1:37:58] ItsMavray: Brick would be a great actor this PD academy thing
[1:38:15] TheShaunDon: to fix the turbo probly, PD cars should only be accessible in MRPD garage. have a pd mec or just call one over... dont go to Mosley for anything but repair.
[1:38:21] Felli: he's also a former cop too @ItsMavray
[1:38:44] Juggerit: Going to Mosleys alone is also a way to help stop that lol
[1:38:58] Lexyz130: I feel like Cornwood should just be the PD mechanic at this point
[1:39:02] Sparrowxz: installing/uninstalling turbos should take way longer
[1:39:08] just_james69: Fake firing pat downing would be funny  LUL LUL

[1:44:38] just_james69: Is this the same person who plays Jane Randal? Cos she's hilarious
[1:44:41] shoootamcgavin: Lol. Just hide a cop in every trunk and just have to wait until the car gets hit
[1:44:42] garbagoo: have a squad under the car waiting and when the stroll in fuck em up
[1:44:43] Lexyz130: ....COULD we do car alarms?
[1:44:45] ProdigyGamesx: Would setting a bait car with someone in the trunk be entrapment?
[1:44:48] cyan0sis: lean on larry
[1:44:48] Crooked_knub: dress undercover as a mechanic and leave a cop car there.
[1:44:51] robertsmithjr: so if someone lock picks a car, if the car is put away do they lose the key, just curious, because that happened in 3.0 right?
[1:44:56] rclemon_: @ProdigyGamesx no
[1:44:58] layla109: @Wort3xx Not much of a RP thing having turbo's stolen with no way to track or investigate the theft neither but I see what u mean too.

[1:50:30] layla109: @Wort3xx  Being able to snatch a turbo out of the vehicles with no handicap or added risk of getting caught doesn't provide or improve RP because theirs no way to know who did what. RP mechanics should serve both cops, civs and crims and not wildly swaying in favor of one side IMO. We'll see what happens in this case.

[2:12:51] Luthercorpz: Lyin Knight

[2:13:20] LoneSoldier021: The devs are already making the process longer to install and remove turbos
[2:13:23] SecretChiley: @BKBiggy Mr K's DNA isnt issue. As long as it has Cornwood's DNA, they can say it was stolen
[2:13:34] 123fudgegamer: police academy chat?
[2:13:35] docterstrange_: state id for those who purchased
[2:13:46] krom01001: need those ink cartridges that they put on clothes LUL
[2:13:48] Switchblade142: @BKBiggy yeah they'd already know since he's the one selling them that he had it
[2:13:51] steve_more: add a "computer" into the turbos, that logs every car they have been in VIA license
[2:13:55] BKBiggy: @SecretChiley cornwood talks to a lot of people and touch a lot of different stuff.

[2:14:31] bangsssss: 12 cadets holy
[2:14:33] SecretChiley: @SecretChiley But the point is, Cornwood is only one touching Turbos and knows who he gives them to.
[2:14:34] TheMah1337: put trackers in them like how cars have and if you want to sell it you can sign over ownership like cars
[2:14:38] condor2104: LOL
[2:14:38] bangsk33t: @SecretChiley The only counterpoint is that selling the turbo to cornwood or slacks would that introduce their dna back onto the turbo now?

[5:13:29] p0tion_x: he's trolling it's not that serious lol
[5:13:32] mcstanky_steven: to be fair at least cornwood isn‚Äôt selling stolen ones LUL
[5:13:33] robertsmithjr: what
[5:13:52] Froggopop: @andrestoga why would he sell at cost when he's spent so much on the pd already
[5:13:55] deadwoodd_: but at the same time, if he does sell them and they get stolen, the PD is fucked. it's a double edged sword - drive without turbos or potentially risk all of them being stolen
[5:14:01] Aces_o: @baxsm yes, pretty sure i said unlucky as well
[5:14:04] sspungg: an the pd knows he stole the turbos from the pd lol well I don‚Äôt think u guys fully know but hell I‚Äôd pay less to lmao
[5:14:33] Lexyz130: ...Bricks in jail and Siobhan isn't down here......
[5:14:49] kuroyasha3: damn no chill LOL
[5:14:50] robertsmithjr: @deadwoodd_ either way their driving without them
[5:15:05] layla109: @Froggopop Cornwood spent on the PD himself. He didn't sign a control nor did anyone force him to. It seems like it was a willing donation on his part. I think Slacks say he would pay him back.
[5:15:05] JoshDaDad: that‚Äôs a dangerous game if the hostage can just say it was a joke lol
[5:15:16] Froggopop: @sspungg how can he steal something he owns

[5:18:54] robertsmithjr: @deadwoodd_ well i feel like he should give slaxks one, he pitched in 25,000 bucks, they dont do a lot of good sitting in a locker, he keeps saying how much pd owes him, if thats true, then they belong to pd anyway, otherwise they dont owe that much, i dunno

[7:23:55] Chaoszero_goc: the robbery of law enforcement covers all of it

[7:24:03] WildWillie419: This is gonna take longer than court saabKEK

[7:24:08] Lexyz130: oh ya, it definitely sounds like K is just trying to piss everyone off right now
[7:24:16] duranggo: Robbery only covers the act, its why the Poss Gov Firearm is 100k and robbery is 10k

[7:25:32] HallJams: the car was in his possession so the gun was at a point in his possession saabFat

[7:25:54] Chaoszero_goc: I agree with you for once, stop yelling at us
[7:26:02] buddha_hands: yeah

[7:26:16] Moobot: Thank you for subbing, AlleyP_! Welcome to the Saabscribers! saabH
[7:26:16] Kevz95: you're right slacks. its an umbrella charge for a reason. adding more charges for robbery of equipment would be stacking

[7:26:31] layla109: ur right
[7:26:35] TeaOnline: then you should be also charging for the spikes by that logic
[7:26:59] ixidakonixi: he should still get the gun charge
[7:27:04] Zinnabunz: KEKW
[7:27:09] xolision: it would be the same as robbery of a financial institution, you would NOT charge again for stolen cash @Ssaab
[7:27:10] issues_i: Then remove Cletus
[7:27:10] robertsmithjr: could dna test it
[7:27:23] HallJams: he's not wrong
[7:27:25] rhaydenz: Do you not take DNA for these charges to see if he was in possession of the firearms?
[7:27:26] lightstormclaw: his dna is on it
[7:27:31] a_ato: true

[7:28:10] Guielme: @Guielme 7th time
[7:28:11] teknowledgy404: this really seems like a not in front of the perp conversation
[7:28:11] geo_logic_: is the cop car considered pd equipment. that seems like enough lol
[7:28:12] duckhunter_88: robbery means steal
[7:28:13] AlleyP_: If it's found on him. He gets charged with it. I don't get the argument
[7:28:13] lvlagg: bruh the gun has his dna, the gun was stolen an hour ago which means it belongs to Mr.K, so it has to be possession as well.
[7:28:14] inndur: Guys, its IN THE SAME CHARGE ... he is getting hit with the gun under the charge
[7:28:15] KoppaVRP: Possession is just that, K didnt have it in his possession so he would only get charged for the robbery

[7:28:20] HallJams: k isn't wrong victim shouldn't be pressing charges saabCringe
[7:28:20] rhaydenz: Why is the charge way more for possession of a firearm vs robbery? Shouldn't robbery be at least the same?
[7:28:20] fellathedude: Cornwood always takes like 2 hrs to do charges. just push it and be done with it
[7:28:23] Lexyz130: I feel like this coulda been decided without K in the room to frustrate y'all lol
[7:28:27] issues_i: DNA on a gun in the river...
[7:28:29] DucK_zy: The charge is for the act of taking it, not posession??
[7:28:38] TimmayHS: y'all gotta get a training class going for something like this, it's hard to watch
[7:28:41] buddha_hands: even without DNA, constructive possession probably covers it lol but if they don't want to charge it, they don't want to what can ya do
[7:28:42] jersey_jesus: The PD gun is Cornwood's it's inclusive of the scenario of the single charge OMEGALUL
[7:28:43] robertsmithjr: true, he made cleetus put the gun in the glove box, andhe had the gun, then he is liable for anything in the car
[7:28:44] p0p19: wait so if a criminal just dumps a gun before they get arrested they cant get a possession charge?
[7:28:45] RomanNumera: Ssaab, you're definitely right. That charge includes stealing pd equipment and weapons. It doesn't matter if he did have it, it is still included in that charge.
[7:28:47] jaaayteeeh: it‚Äôs an umbrella charge that covers both
[7:28:47] WildWillie419: Why does Cletus want to keep adding more charges? It‚Äôs never going to be entirely consistent across all officers

[7:30:26] RealistReason: Maybe have this conversation not in front of the criminal?
[7:30:32] TheGleeb: so if you drop a gun you can't prove possession?
[7:30:36] hopalong92: I get where Cornwood is saying but in the end it was not found on k
[7:30:40] just_james69: Whatever you all decide this RP has been incredible! W <3
[7:30:42] KingDekar: @Eddie1225 i want you to know, im trying hard here
[7:30:44] eqnjn: Bro Mr.K's DNA is on the gun, Cleetus says his gun was stolen off him by K. It is so easy to articulate the gun was in Mr.K's possession during the pursuit. Push the charge and let the courts decide
[7:30:51] KingDekar: LuL

[7:30:54] budogorilla: He did possess them after the robbery
[7:30:54] geo_logic_: does him having cornwoods phone mean its robbery of a government employee? or because a phone isnt pd equipment it doesnt count
[7:30:57] DanLGG: I think this conversation needs to be had honestly
[7:30:59] issues_i: DNA on a gun in the river is ....
[7:31:00] fellathedude: it's gonna take till storm at this rate
[7:31:02] RomanNumera: Would spikes and the gun both just fall under that robbery charge? That's how I read it.
[7:31:03] xMike6: Chat he hasnt put his dna in the mdw yet
[7:31:06] timedoggg: @eqnjn it was recovery in the same incident
[7:31:18] Horikuuu: Just remember theres no recording
[7:31:25] Chaoszero_goc: can you explain to cornwood again, I think hes confused
[7:31:27] layla109: I'd say run the DNA to clarify
[7:31:29] inndur: @eqnjn also saab is doing the thing called RP and a damn fine job of it by taking into consideration that the gun was found under water which would remove all dna
[7:31:37] ProSpeakman: The fact that the charge describes everything entailed means that there shouldn't even be a discussion on it
[7:31:38] xolision: cornwood wnats that 10% KEKW
[7:31:42] titanvol29: Cooking lol
[7:31:44] TeaOnline: why would they make 1 charge for it if the blanket charge for it is 90k less
[7:31:47] WildWillie419: If it‚Äôs this debatable, seems not worth charging
[7:32:05] KingDekar: whos interrogating who? OMEGALAUGHING
[7:32:15] Chaoszero_goc: @TeaOnline the gun wasnt found on his person
[7:32:15] buuutty: no recording thats a DAP

[7:32:54] xolision: LYING, NO INTEGRITY LUL
[7:32:56] xMike6: This is the first time ive seen cops being interrogated like this when discussing charges between officers LULW Mr K knows hoe to do it
[7:32:58] jersey_jesus: HUH
[7:33:02] Wort3xx: never told him his rights to i think :S
[7:33:04] magnets_: so suddenly K does know what was in his car lmfao
[7:33:08] Eddie1225: its almost like its RP

[7:34:25] layla109: Cornwood is splitting hairs
[7:34:26] rhaydenz: I think the issue is robbery of a law enforcement officer should be a higher charge.

[7:34:35] Horikuuu: @Ssaab As a captain can you overturn charges that Cletus adds/says ?
[7:34:35] AlleyP_: Now we talk outside lUL
[7:34:36] Wynter282: you have got literally zero information out of K
[7:34:43] Wynter282: for the last hour
[7:34:55] jersey_jesus: Cornwood want that 100k EZ
[7:34:58] cptburritobeard: Why is k getting treated like he's different from POS crims
[7:35:08] wafiy637: cornwood smoking crack ? KEKW give him DAPS again ..
[7:35:10] mirin313: @cptburritobeard cus he is
[7:35:20] geo_logic_: are you arguing the same thing?
[7:35:24] cary7: OMEGALAUGHING
[7:35:29] cardztide: what the shit. how does he not get possession for guns AND spikes?
[7:35:40] RomanNumera: But that's included in that charge. He might not have read the robbery charge.
[7:35:42] CuBanMumzy: def had possession
[7:35:44] kheg_: P O S S E S S I O N
[7:35:47] ExoticMeats: Someone needs a nap
[7:35:52] allenog03: yea, what is the fair charge
[7:35:52] RonJon: possession of a stolen gun
[7:35:55] focustft: @geo_logic_ seems like they're arguing the semantics of what possession means
[7:36:01] inndur: @cardztide because is covered in the umbrella charge
[7:36:03] cptburritobeard: Cornwood literally a victim of Stockholm Syndrome he needs to be taken off this asap imo
[7:36:06] smo_ot: isn‚Äôt the charge 1400 minutes?
[7:36:16] buddha_hands: theres like multiple layers of him possessing it OMEGALAUGHING whoever's lead can make a choice & deal with w/e happens tho Shruge meh
[7:36:16] zeldaspirit: Just get a prosecutor, jeez lol
[7:36:17] duckuru: he could take it and put it back, does that mean i possessed it lol
[7:36:17] issues_i: Cornwood is wrong here I think.
[7:36:23] RonJon: he's the other person
[7:36:25] texasmade222: so in cornwood way would that not be 2years and 200k in fines for just that
[7:36:28] ProSpeakman: Is he just unaware of the charge's exact description
[7:36:29] jaaayteeeh: I love cornwood but I agree @cptburritobeard
[7:36:31] TeaOnline: Saab if you‚Äôre chasing someone and they throw weed in a bush can you not charge them for possession?
[7:36:32] Horikuuu: Yeah Cornwood is getting too personal with this case
[7:36:38] TimidPineapple: if he puts his thumb on the gun does he possess it?
[7:36:52] magnets_: i think cornwood just doesn't understand that possession would be wrapped up under the robbery
[7:36:53] plzhateme: hes wrong
[7:36:53] couchconner: So letter of the law if u have possession, you get charged with possession. But if you arent in possession when arrested, you still get possession?
[7:36:55] just_james69: Ramees charge took like an hour less yesterday LUL
[7:36:57] HallJams: robbery covers the action of robbing... then at that point he possesses it
[7:37:01] gatsymphony00: Seems like a aweful lot of overstepping for  PPO not to mention the victim
[7:37:01] hueyjets: nathankb_ pls help who is right here
[7:37:01] RonJon: that doesn't umbrella every single thing in the world is what he's saying
[7:37:03] julho94: What
[7:37:07] Moobot: Thanks for subbing, Thanskiii! Welcome to the Saabscribers! saabH
[7:37:08] layla109: WHAT
[7:37:10] justind33: The DNA shows that he had handled the gun but at the time of the arrest he was not in possesion if the gun.
[7:37:12] teknowledgy404: he's saying if you don't charge it then any criminal can just drop the gun and say "I didn't posess it you can't charge that"
[7:37:15] Thanskiii: Thanskiii subscribed at Tier 1. 
[7:37:17] wafiy637: bro im lose KEKW
[7:37:18] RomanNumera: How does he steal it without ever having it?
[7:37:21] ComradeGreetingCard: constructive possession
[7:37:22] joshcreed1: HAD it
[7:37:22] cptburritobeard: I love cornwood too but K is obviously taking advantage of him. K is in cornwoods head right now
[7:37:22] judgement_12: He is arguing that the DNA proves possession
[7:37:26] MyDoSe_: If there is no evidence of him having it how would you charge him for stealing???
[7:37:33] xolision: there is no law for having possessed a gun @Ssaab
[7:37:38] Chaoszero_goc: If they saw him throw it I think maybe
[7:37:42] Thanskiii: he‚Äôs trying to have that charge added because at one time he possessed the gun, even though it wasn‚Äôt in his possession at the time of being taken in
[7:37:43] arcticOP: @MyDoSe_ dna on the gun?
[7:37:45] RonJon: he's arguign that it does
[7:37:45] inndur: @Ssaab you are very correct
[7:37:51] magnets_: yeah you can't rob someone without possessing it
[7:37:52] cptburritobeard: He'd throw PD under the bus for K right now he's compromised IMO
[7:37:53] jaaayteeeh: isn‚Äôt cornwood conflicted because he‚Äôs the victim?
[7:38:01] xolision: possessed vs possession, it aint sticking @Ssaab
[7:38:01] XenonL4: he is going to be pissed and then not want to work with you
[7:38:04] khrow: Is it a stack? Is that the issue?
[7:38:04] geo_logic_: ill be honest, im too high and ive lost the plot
[7:38:05] WildWillie419: If him possessing the gun got pardoned by Crane, then him not possessing the gun is gonna be Susge
[7:38:05] duranggo: @inndur its constructive possession. he 100% should be charged on the table
[7:38:09] The_Keenan: Hes trying to light the city on fire
[7:38:09] Wynter282: how did he steal it and end up not possessing it
[7:38:14] layla109: Cornwood is conflicted tho
[7:38:16] Ezkblo: Sorry if this is a stupid question, but isn't Cornwood literally the victim, thus giga conflicted and him being there risks the entire case in court?
[7:38:17] jersey_jesus: I can see what he's saying, stack and then plead down
[7:38:25] Skyler56: girl wants him in jail for life
[7:38:26] HallJams: he can't fight it though
[7:38:27] Abester47: He wants to stack any charge that can tick, then work down a deal.
[7:38:27] xolision: possessed vs possession
[7:38:30] timedoggg: I don't agree with the possession charge if it got recovered in the same incident
[7:38:30] Horikuuu: The menu was already given what
[7:38:34] Wynter282: yea dont take cornwood back in hes throwing the whole thing lol
[7:38:35] fishnchips333: this was covered by captains before with cornwood. you cant charge possession over dna because then anyone who touched it would be possessing the item and you cant charge everyone with that. its whoever holds it
[7:38:35] RonJon: @ssaaab he's saying that by your logic you finding weed next to someone with their DNA on it you can't charge them with possession of weed
[7:38:40] wafiy637: facts .....
[7:38:44] allenog03: HE IS GOING TO WIN
[7:38:45] Thanskiii: LEGIT - he‚Äôs trying to have that charge added because at one time he possessed the gun, even though it wasn‚Äôt in his possession at the time of being taken in
[7:38:45] just_james69: I agree with rowan
[7:38:45] RonJon: ARE YOU HIGH?
[7:38:50] DanLGG: he could argue it in court and say I put the gun in the glove box
[7:38:52] duranggo: @layla109 no he isn't, conflicted is in a position in opposition but cornwood is isn't in opposition to the PD
[7:38:53] inndur: @duranggo the incident is robbing and kidnapping an officer. The charge which is Robbing and kiddnapping an officer which is ONE umbrella charge is what happened in this case
[7:38:54] reezyy92: slacks needs to go 10-42
[7:38:58] Wynter282: and since you let him go in there you spent the entire time arguing with each other instead of interrogating the actual criminal
[7:39:06] Thanskiii: they aren‚Äôt understanding the difference between possession and possessed
[7:39:08] Saxon217: this cadet icant
[7:39:09] alexleon540: Your right 100%
[7:39:11] RomanNumera: It's not leniency, it's the wording of the charge. Stealing PD equipment includes possessing the equipment already. It definitely fits under that charge.
[7:39:13] TimidPineapple: he can just argue he spit on it and thats where the dna came from
[7:39:14] cardztide: this is why you always lose every single court case LUL
[7:39:15] cptburritobeard: Cornwoods compromised he shouldn't be taken serious right now
[7:39:19] allenog03: The jumps in evidence to conclusions once surfaced and fough in court in good faith does not uphold for most it really, seems
[7:39:19] MsFreya_x: What are yall yapping about
[7:39:22] Baileybrad: Slacks is right here
[7:39:25] ykicka: they need crane in there for this
[7:39:25] arcticOP: someone go find a lawyer my god
[7:39:28] duranggo: @inndur its the *act* of robbing, it only covers the act not what is taken, the items taken are separate possession charges.
[7:39:29] allenog03: Will the charges stick
[7:39:29] fraudiola9: yo morning saab
[7:39:31] xolision: possessed vs possession, you cant go back for everyone who touched the gun, its the person who was found with it at the time.
[7:39:33] RonJon: @Thanskiii they're saying that in this instance it's so soon and found right next to him where he was that you can argue actual possession not just past tense
[7:39:34] buddha_hands: DNA, testimony, it being right near the only suspect's body peepoGiggle
[7:39:38] seniorbunss: what a mess
[7:39:39] Aye_Snow: hows putting the right charges being lenient lmfao
[7:39:39] ZoiraX: Dna does not mean he got the gun
[7:39:44] really_tired10: If all the fellow officers are against you, maybe you are in the wrong here?
[7:39:45] Wynter282: you literally have one of the best prosecutors as a cadet why isnt he here
[7:39:47] Chaoszero_goc: if anything the umbrella charge just needs a higher fine
[7:39:49] alexleon540: Slacks is 100% in the right
[7:39:51] issues_i: Slacks is correct, Cornwood seems on the edge of an emotional breakdown.
[7:39:53] Skyler56: was
[7:39:56] KingDekar: LULW
[7:39:58] joshcreed1: WAS
[7:39:59] Witzz_: WAS
[7:40:02] DeadAssYeetOnEm: OMEGALAUGHING
[7:40:03] ZoiraX: Was
[7:40:07] MyDoSe_: Was
[7:40:08] reezyy92: slacks is compromised
[7:40:08] Thanskiii: @ronjon but the city shows no timeline on how long dna stays on something
[7:40:09] ThreeNPink: whould the dna wash off with it being in the warter?
[7:40:10] hopalong92: Letter of the law states it has to be on his possession, it want found on him
[7:40:10] joshcreed1: not IS
[7:40:11] MarsCons: But it was in the river?
[7:40:12] militarygamerphil: Mr K Fan here and slacks fan, just wanted to say thank god you and Cornwood are here because this RP could go completely different. just wanted to say love you slacks and respect you as a RP cop and streamer
[7:40:12] TimmayHS: Cletus and the PPO are right
[7:40:16] ExoticMeats: But you just got that information
[7:40:17] DanLGG: His dna being on thr gun does not prove possession.
[7:40:17] fishnchips333: i hate slacks....but he is right here lol
[7:40:19] msdeell: true
[7:40:21] CuBanMumzy: please ask a  lawyer
[7:40:21] inndur: @duranggo no literally go back in the vod and read the charge it LITERALLY says AND/OR taking equipment off of them literally verbatim
[7:40:22] reezyy92: slacks compromised just trying to avoid a hell week
[7:40:25] Chaoszero_goc: my 7tv is broke, I cant see all the deleted tea BibleThump
[7:40:25] fellathedude: Wut is he talking about
[7:40:28] cptburritobeard: +1 Cornwood for RPing Stockholm Syndrome
[7:40:29] RonJon: @Thanskiii in the machine it shows how long ago the dna was added, they do know
[7:40:31] Landarokz: Ssaab is right imo. If you charge everyone because they previously possessed a gun in a situation, then you could have 4 crims all charged simply by playing hot potato with a single weapon.
[7:40:36] lorenzozz_zz: does dna not wash off?
[7:40:36] MyDoSe_: Cornwood, isnt listening.
[7:40:39] xolision: possessed vs possession
[7:40:40] inndur: @duranggo literally go read. its verbatim
[7:40:41] fraudiola9: bitched by PPOs AINTNOWAY
[7:40:42] baasbovenbaas27: timmacCLAP
[7:40:46] KoppaVRP: I love cornwood but mans not grasping the difference between was in possession and is in possession
[7:40:47] layla109: @duranggo Oh i see. Thx. Got definitions mixed up. I don't think corn needs to lead in processing the guy that kidnapped him tho.
[7:40:48] ExoticMeats: He was assuming before hand and sorta arguing mechanics
[7:40:49] MarsCons: Active possession vs once touched it
[7:40:50] Zhang_1888: @cptburritobeard lmao
[7:40:51] Phoenix_Avaa: letter of the law
[7:40:54] TimmayHS: there's DNA evidence that he possessed it
[7:40:54] joshcreed1: WAS in possession is diferent to IS in possession
[7:40:55] WildWillie419: How is he arguing that added an extra charge is helping out the crim? saabKEK
[7:40:57] awildpog: objection Weirdge
[7:40:57] XenonL4: possessed vs possession
[7:40:59] duranggo: @inndur yes I read the charge, the charge does not cover the possession just the act of robbing, you should read it carefully. They talked about it stacking when they made the charge
[7:40:59] poicebringer: why not just ask a judge
[7:40:59] hopalong92: Cornwood ready for a bench trial tonight?
[7:41:01] Brewday445: Does cornwood not understand that the captains talked about this before because it could lead to a lot of issues
[7:41:01] cary7: Then have him appeal it LULW
[7:41:02] arcticOP: constructive possession......
[7:41:08] WildWillie419: objection weird
[7:41:12] layla109: call a judge PLEASE
[7:41:16] deadrise123akahashiramav1: K said he was looking threw the glovebox so he could of touched it
[7:41:19] titanvol29: Damn is it worth this
[7:41:20] dakota22446: !backseat
[7:41:20] StreamElements: Do not try to influence Saab's actions or direct him to do something.
[7:41:21] Thanskiii: @ronjon again it‚Äôs the difference in what is written on the code because of possessed vs possession
[7:41:22] Lexyz130: if only we knew a judge we could ask
[7:41:22] betrue2urself: mehdiH mehdiH mehdiH
[7:41:23] RealistReason: Crane saabDink
[7:41:24] ZoiraX: You right
[7:41:24] SGisMe: HmmCouncil hoppers rn
[7:41:25] fishnchips333: @Ssaab nah you right
[7:41:26] judgement_12: That isn't the point being argued
[7:41:26] dakota22446: saabOwo
[7:41:26] titanvol29: You're right
[7:41:28] gamesbychaz: youre right sir
[7:41:31] Scrando: As a cornwood viewer, I think you're 100% right
[7:41:31] cptburritobeard: Why is cornwood even on this case lol
[7:41:33] realmarkwayne: ur right
[7:41:33] layla109: We KNOW Ssaab!
[7:41:34] Wynter282: just get xavier in here hes literaly a prosecutor
[7:41:35] Purecrew: @Ssaab Is 100% right, Possession is 9/10th of the law, The penal code states you have to have possession of the gun.
[7:41:36] WildWillie419: K is gonna have time served at this rate saabKEK
[7:41:39] Hendrics: im surprised its not already a drawn out rule about the DNA mechanic
[7:41:39] ExoticMeats: Los Santos laws are not the same as Irl chat
[7:41:40] buddha_hands: doesn't sound like he's arguing it anyway lol
[7:41:41] just_james69: Finally a judge haha
[7:41:42] jollypnda: this level of thought leads to cops being shot at traffic stops
[7:41:42] MyDoSe_: Possessed vs possession slacks is right
[7:41:42] issues_i: Have Corn reread the law.
[7:41:48] duranggo: It does not cover possession just the act of robbing
[7:41:51] RonJon: @Thanskiii and again, they're arguing actual current possession because he JUST droppped it, just like everyone who ditches weed running
[7:41:53] anthonyg729: so as long as they drop the gun before getting arrested they avoid that charge?
[7:41:53] Chaoszero_goc: yo we get it, you have to convince cornwood
[7:41:55] espeiranza: the fact that he drop the gone 2 second before he get caught doens'nt meen he doesn't have it
[7:41:58] inndur: NO Evidence proves that he ROBBED cornwood of the gun
[7:41:58] Skyler56: ya its 1440 months for a reason
[7:42:01] xolision: 100% correct, you are the captain, call it @Ssaab
[7:42:02] RomanNumera: You should re read it to cornwood lol, it's pretty clearly worded.
[7:42:04] LoneSoldier021: So if I was walking down the stairs and touched the railing on the way down, I'm in possession of the railing?
[7:42:07] xMike6: Hes not gonna talk anyway
[7:42:07] titanvol29: We get it cornwood doesn't
[7:42:11] inndur: He did not posses the gun when captured
[7:42:14] Gabilonski: the robbery charge implies possession aswell
[7:42:16] MarsCons: @lonesoldier021  lol
[7:42:21] inndur: The DNA is on the gun because he ROBBED cornword
[7:42:23] Lexyz130: why is K dictating these terms lol
[7:42:24] xolision: isnt cornwood a PPO LUL
[7:42:25] hopalong92: All DNA shows is he possessed it at a point but he was not in possession of it
[7:42:27] cptburritobeard: Cornwood's 100% mind controlled right now
[7:42:32] jersey_jesus: Robbery of law enforcement is like robbery of financial institution back in the day
[7:42:38] judgement_12: @Purecrew Cornwood is saying the DNA proves the possession because it can be there without him having it
[7:42:40] cptburritobeard: And K is so smug about it
[7:42:46] espeiranza: @inndur he droped the gun in front of cop running at him
[7:42:47] judgement_12: @judgement_12 can't*

[7:42:48] postAmongUsist: @LoneSoldier021 if you ripped that railing off the wall and took it with you, but dropped it somewhere later, yes
[7:42:51] just_james69: I just don't think I should  be there to sway your decisions
[7:42:51] yayoyoda: Cordwood's bar license is playing with his mind lol. he is acting more of a lawyer than PD. Give K like 3k hours but don't compromise the whole case by adding bs charges that will affect the court's decision
[7:42:56] Cyno_R: As a cornwood viewer... I agree with ssaab. Letter of the law is 100% here
[7:42:56] BobFromAccounts: I don‚Äôt get it. Cornwood can‚Äôt prove that he was in possession. K can say, oh Cornwood asked me to pass him his gun out of the glovebox

[7:43:07] just_james69: K*
[7:43:11] inndur: @espeiranza no he dropped the gun in the water but they don't know that in RP so invalid
[7:43:17] dakota22446: I think slacks is wrong actually
[7:43:18] jdotno: Crane made a mistake by giving just cornwood a bar license.
[7:43:18] anthonyg729: everyone is just gonna drop stuff before getting arrested to avoid possession charges
[7:43:19] magnets_: yeah you're right
[7:43:19] cptburritobeard: Corn would throw PD under the bus right now
[7:43:21] Purecrew: The only thing that proves is he possessed it not possession of it.
[7:43:24] MyDoSe_: @BobFromAccounts Yea that is more than enough evidence.
[7:43:24] allenog03: Clap this rp
[7:43:25] dakota22446: (I haven‚Äôt been watching)
[7:43:31] magnets_: you can't rob someone without possessing it

[7:43:35] magnets_: @dakota22446 OMEGALAUGHING
[7:43:36] hopalong92: Cornwood is the victim I don‚Äôt think he should even be involved with this. Wouldn‚Äôt that make it seem like he trying to over charge him
[7:43:38] Hendrics: full menu
[7:43:40] MyDoSe_: @MyDoSe_ enough reaonsable doubt*
[7:43:40] dakota22446: Tomfoolery
[7:43:47] zodiaccmx: your right here  cornwood is thinking of the fine here
[7:43:48] RealistReason: @anthonyg729 Thats the problem. Shot a cop in their face, throw the gun down, EZ
[7:44:02] ExoticMeats: People forget it's rp
[7:44:02] allenog03: theres sm layers to figuring out if Mr K gets away with no charges or, charges KEKW
[7:44:11] xolision: LUL cornrool
[7:44:12] issues_i: Real, you still get Murder, not possession.
[7:44:14] LegendOfAiur: so he was possession of the car, which makes him possess the contents of the car
[7:44:21] buddha_hands: and drivers are responsible for contents of vehicles or else there'd be no point searching cars lol
[7:44:24] layla109: Wait didn't cornwood go down? K should be gsr tested maybe
[7:44:25] MyDoSe_: Yea that is a lot of reasonable doubt, no way possession could stick.
[7:44:28] RomanNumera: You'd still get attempted murder.
[7:44:29] teknowledgy404: turns out cornwood was 100% right lol
[7:44:34] xMike6: If u drop the gun before u get cuffed chat, u cant get charged with posession EZ
[7:44:42] cardztide: Judge Gatsby already said you're wrong to Cornwood LUL
[7:44:44] Wynter282: what are you even negotiating for what is he giving lol?
[7:44:48] cptburritobeard: @hopalong92 it's highly unethical, and this is a clear example of why it's not allowed. Cornwood is clearly compromised right now
[7:44:49] espeiranza: @inndur they know by the fact he took it from cornwood do you have a witness plus they passed a dna test with positive result and the gun is like 5 meter from him
[7:45:07] duranggo: why drop anything?
[7:45:08] BobFromAccounts: Possession is the act of having something at present time or being in control of it at present time. when he was arrested he did control it or have it on his person
[7:45:08] Lexyz130: HUH
[7:45:09] buddha_hands: @Wynter282 good question lmao hasn't provided any info at all
[7:45:12] AlleyP_: HUH
[7:45:15] allenog03: dr OMEGALAUGHING p all of it
[7:45:27] cptburritobeard: "Let's drop everything" like he's calling the shots... wtf is this
[7:45:30] BobFromAccounts: Ssaab is 100% right here. Cornwood overthinking it
[7:45:34] yayoyoda: F it chief Stacks hit em with all of emüòÇüòÇ
[7:45:36] inndur: @espeiranza but they can't prove that the gun did not get washed out of the vehicle in RP... he did not have possession of the gun, he only robbed it. The dna only proves that he ROBBED the gun
[7:45:45] inndur: Literally that simple
[7:46:00] Lexyz130: I feel like he's gonna negotiate all this down, then still plead not guilty cause he has Ramee and Siobhan in his pocket
[7:46:19] just_james69: Bros having too much input here on his own case against him LUL
[7:46:22] Wynter282: @Lexyz130 neitehr of which are lawyers
[7:46:26] espeiranza: @BobFromAccounts so if crim drop a stolen thing 1 second before he get in cuf then he did not steal anything right ?
[7:46:32] reezyy92: slaacks ur wrong buddy
[7:46:33] RonJon: @BobFromAccounts if you ditch something running from the cops you can still be charged with possession of it even if you don't have it when they grab you
[7:46:37] LastBreath05: hey sanitation workers we caught the guy who keeps robbing you but we dropped the charges so the eagle act is useless
[7:46:51] cptburritobeard: They literally caught him in the act??
[7:46:54] xMike6: @lastbreath05 civilian lives dont matter
[7:46:54] AlleyP_: giveme32Facepalm
[7:46:56] layla109: K's just jerking the PD around and making them doubt themselves to drop charges that would kick them hard in court
[7:47:01] inndur: @espeiranza no, if they SEE him drop it.. thats different. They did not see it. Again the point is PROVING what happened and they cannot in this case.
[7:47:10] LegendOfAiur: he was held hostage KEKW
[7:47:13] inndur: @espeiranza literally... what you can PROVE vs what you can't
[7:47:18] buddha_hands: did he just argue cornwoods point FOR him? lmaooo

[7:47:43] PolygonStatic: LUL
[7:47:46] Wynter282: before you sent cornwood in here you were literally like "WE ARE PUSHING ALL CHARGES IF HE DOESNT GIVE US ANYTHING" then now hes negotiating his charges but hasnt given you a thing what the heck lol
[7:47:50] allenog03: whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat

[7:55:31] inndur: Chat of course his DNA was on it... he robbed it... like good lord. Of course his dna was on it. DNA doesn't prove that he didn;t put the gun down in the car and it washed out of the car. It doesn't prove that
[7:55:31] max6speed: Wonder what else the DNA matches
[7:55:32] vNotoriousOG: @woolfdesign yea i could be wrong just dont think they should be spending this much time arguing about it. Multiple ppl can have dna on the pd gun cant just charge possession on all of them

[7:55:41] salvi9: he did the crime though

[9:51:45] mylefts: is slacks happy about how the charges are?
[9:51:45] HARM0N: I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any problem with the charges but putting a guy there for 3 days without a working prison system is a lil fucked but all love kebunCG rameeLove kebunCG rameeLove kebunLuv
[9:51:47] luna_purple94: adding that charge or not wouldn‚Äôt have made a difference, K was already gonna talk but it did get messy by adding it & then removing it for him to talk
[9:51:48] MarsCons: Timthetatman could attest lol
[9:51:49] ens0mniac: @neonsloths nah, if K isn‚Äôt able to bullshit slacks into a corner he‚Äôs gonna just pull an ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt give a fuck, I‚Äôll just kill people‚Äù thing
[9:51:51] twotgobblen1: No, the reason moon is bald is because he is filled to the fucking brim with testosterone, he used to be fucking jacked but had to stop working out just to keep the little hair he has left

[9:52:55] MsFreya_x: dont backseat
[9:52:56] msdeell: but he was pushing to get charges straight away
[9:53:05] Kurakita: You forgot to charge him with Kidnapping as well....lol
[9:53:06] ens0mniac: @killamontage22 yeah attempted murder should be way more punishing than it is
[9:53:09] Zinnabunz: !backseat

[9:53:24] ChirithyChi: Why's the server in Silent Hill mode?
[9:53:44] AidenFenner: for role play reasons it should be pushed
[9:53:44] Marthentic: @Kubiboi agreed
[9:53:53] feeltheshaft: K isn‚Äôt OOC mad. respect to you for great RP
[9:54:01] retro_redesign: @Kubiboi 100%
[9:54:02] iGreffer: Sooo turbos are a 1400 as well?
[9:54:09] Lukeyguy: @killamontage22 don't think many would disagree. There defo few ? Times/fines
[9:54:16] Zinnabunz: kokCampfire hot
[9:54:20] Saxon217: @Marthentic yeah a tracker should be a physical item imo
[9:54:26] HeyItsChe: I think the issue was the fan in that room was going way too slow so everyone got heated...blame the fan guys
[9:54:31] buddha_hands: tried helping him out & he refused to help himself, so got railed Shruge
[9:54:40] Marthentic: @Saxon217 that would be so sick tbh
[9:54:41] LXXELIFE: good job boy let‚Äôs go slap ass in the locker
[9:54:49] GoldOv3rdose: the posession charge is out of hand
[9:54:53] DESHAWNTE: @Saxon217 it was in 3.0
[9:55:00] fancylol: @feeltheshaft im sure saab knows that but slacks is a different story he just dealt with and heard the worst for a captain
[9:55:00] tonethemoan: he didnt ‚Ä¶ he claimed he put them on the seat !
[9:55:01] deathhhstrokee: The charges she be pressed but the time 8s redicu
[9:55:05] Night_Owl36: no way to clean dna is kina wild imo
[9:55:14] Baileybrad: For an rp server finding DNA on a gun in the rapids is kinda nuts
[9:55:15] Leetween: Leetween subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! I hace a question @Ssaab isnt possession built into the robery?  when you rob someone  you automatically posses their items.  that is why the time and fine are high?
[9:55:18] kid93: :c
[9:55:32] Newname_5: @buddha_hands "helping" when the goalpost got moved in the opposite direction LUL good one
[9:55:33] johnnytruel0ve: this guy didnt charge the lawyer with the pd gun how is he agreeing
[9:55:34] TMomenTzG: and thats the problem. spirit > letter, not letter > spirit
[9:55:41] BurningFlag: peepoPls peepoPls peepoPls peepoPls
[9:55:41] skimomoula7: Letter of the law is the ultimate cap
[9:55:44] connor_flynn: I‚Äôm a Massive CG watcher, For all the hoppers. it‚Äôs RP all the negativity needs to throw out.  touch grass and let the streamers stream.  Slacks and all the officers and Kebun,  good job on the RP!!! keep it up! ü§òüôÇ
[9:55:46] krooksoner210: Why talk about it if you agree?
[9:55:49] weeeeeeeedman: DNA on a gun found in a river
[9:55:49] skedat: @baileybrad EXACTLY WHAT IM SAYING!
[9:55:51] tonethemoan: he said he threw them on the seat he never ever said glovebox about the guns
[9:55:53] Its_Harveys: so what about the lawyer who was GSR positive and had a pd gun on her?
[9:55:54] giibby32: I thought this wasn‚Äôt real life LUL
[9:55:57] Daddy__Winston: i feel the blanket charge should have covered both in RP. 3400 months is just to much
[9:56:05] fishnchips333: @GoldOv3rdose possession really needs to be worked over DoJ. they argue textbook possession is having it on you but then have constructed pos that you just need to be able to posses it
[9:56:05] repomanhotcars: Some of these characters take their position a little too much
[9:56:06] Eddie1225: some of yall cant be serious LMAO
[9:56:08] Brandonhipster: Do you think there should be a way to wipe DNA off a item?
[9:56:09] deathhhstrokee: The charges she be pressed but the time is ridiculous. It's basically a ban bc doj is nothing at this point.
[9:56:11] KEY05: no way for crims to combat DNAis ruff
[9:56:14] PolygonStatic: LookUp
[9:56:19] King_Drew_: With setting standards, should the PD go back and press charges on the legal aid that was caught with a PD weapon?
[9:56:20] Vesuvius______: I‚Äôm a CG watcher, k especially, the lack of clarity with exactly what the charges were is the issue. from an outside perspective
[9:56:21] rdc7: @giibby32 lol
[9:56:21] Waltz_Disney: wtf it charged me for that emote and i didnt even want it
[9:56:22] kreljos: Eddie1225 scary thing is they might be :/
[9:56:23] BBCapitalist: can anyone tell me why justin got 21 days?
[9:56:25] voidptr01: the TLDR is, they gave him charges that were reasonable‚Ä¶. then waisted his time for 3 hours added a bunch more charges and then pretended they were doing him a favor‚Ä¶ but it is what it is..  RP for another day Kappa
[9:56:27] BurningFlag: @Eddie1225 they just joking Kappa
[9:56:30] arcticOP: @Daddy__Winston why is the blanket charge 10x lower than the possession charge. its not a blanket charge
[9:56:35] KiLLaMontage22: Wouldn't DNA get washed off in the water
[9:56:42] yaboizelda: the line‚Äù the gun floating away‚Äù was pretty good ngl
[9:56:44] MarsCons: @king_drew_ yepp
[9:56:50] GoldOv3rdose: @fishnchips333 if u ever touch something, constructive possession for an entire day
[9:56:50] KevinnTCG: @KiLLaMontage22 no
[9:56:54] ExoticMeats: Flop we just spent 3 hrs talking about this, please
[9:56:57] harrytitsmitchell: hammer fucking down
[9:56:58] Daddy__Winston: @arcticOP they both are 24hrs
[9:56:58] GoldOv3rdose: its def Strong
[9:57:02] KevinnTCG: @Robert_Paulson1 2 days i think
[9:57:05] Soee1337: Im curious - wasnt the "conversation" with Nathan (chief justice) OOC?
[9:57:06] Elmond: that damn adhd
[9:57:06] inndur: @KiLLaMontage22 people believe in mechanics not RP for things like that
[9:57:10] Lambo__TV: as a CG viewer watching RP - it is also kinda crazy finding ‚Äúdna‚Äù on a gun in the river lol that‚Äôs the only thing I think is crazy in all of this
[9:57:11] officialchode: @feeltheshaft he‚Äôs not OOC mad at the cops. it‚Äôs more the punishment for doing RP. He‚Äôs pretty much soft banned for 3 days for a scenario Tessa (admin) set up.  It‚Äôs better to shoot a cop than rob them with how the system is set up.
[9:57:11] Soee1337: So does that count? KEKW
[9:57:15] mstet7: flop is saying yes he should be charged but he let the legal aid that was gsr positive and in possession of pd gun go ü§î
[9:57:17] 95sg: if it‚Äôs letter of the law, why didn‚Äôt the legal aid get charged instantly ?
[9:57:19] RegulatorTTV: love that a captain Is taking a vote heheh
[9:57:20] Legends_333: @ExoticMeats facts, tbh we're probably going to hear this so many times over LUL
[9:57:22] DESHAWNTE: @Saxon217 nvm i was thinking about the Panic button. ‚ù§Ô∏è
[9:57:23] psicosmoker1979: yeah 3 days in jail doesnt cause any problem, from the same guys that cry about daps
[9:57:24] WheresMyVodka: LETTER OF THE LAW PUSH THE CHARGE KEKW
[9:57:27] fishnchips333: @KiLLaMontage22 in the past cornwood has had a case where he said it washed off a knife when suspect went into the ocean but now he says it wouldnt
[9:57:30] AwesomeAaron15: Gun in the glovebox of a car you are driving is possession.
[9:57:30] Bill_Collector: The cops don't write the laws, period. If people think it's a soft ban that's a problem with the city government
[9:57:33] giibby32: LUL
[9:57:35] DESHAWNTE: pog

[9:57:45] Newname_5: @Soee1337 yeah but shit is a server health issue so justified

[9:57:54] xLesbiHonest: the letter of the law, says we gotta do it. RP doesn't matter
[9:57:54] xLyric_: Why hasn‚Äôt it been pushed then?
[9:57:54] TMomenTzG: why is the server taking the philosophy of letter of the law > spirit of the law
[9:57:55] skimomoula7: Not letter of the law anymore
[9:57:59] dakota22446: make flop fly YUMP
[9:58:00] buddha_hands: well thats what discretion is for, which crane said that one night when reviewing the murphy case
[9:58:04] TCGK_SUBZERO: essaying HOLY

[9:58:15] hasbro3210: don‚Äôt cops have opinion or  bring up charges to the judges?
[9:58:16] harrytitsmitchell: shoot his face off his face

[9:58:19] MarsCons: JD and law is strict and doesnt seem like the server rp is that way right now
[9:58:20] fishnchips333: @AwesomeAaron15 in that case we gotta hit him with like 5 guns because cornwood had multiple guns in the car lockbox lol

[9:59:21] TimmayHS: You're right about the judge thing, but don't use it as an excuse for going out of order in the process and giving reduced charges first before giving them all the charges. PD needs training on how the law works and how charges should be presented.
