[1:14:45] SharkzGG_: @IanDooleyTV its better to appear united at the top and deal with their issues away from the officers, he's doing it right
[1:14:45] zZeliel: captains so dumb lmao no wonder it's a shitshow they all have the same mindset
[1:14:45] Vikarious_X: 40kgs of weed? Well anyway...
[1:14:46] WhoIsD33z: guys slacks is trying to tell them that the mechanics is bad because the weight doesnt make sense be cause so far everyone basically has a felony charge as long as they have like 1 bag of weed

[1:15:33] SunkySplash: that guy is the worst cop
[1:15:34] nickdrawsstuff: Ask Slacks if he's sleeping with Ruth
[1:15:34] SharkzGG_: @IanDooleyTV oh 100% agreed I'd be sus too haha
[1:15:34] slatt5: the law changes so much to be punishing people so early on for figuring out how to do things imo
[1:15:36] loldoodlol: SHITSHOW
[1:15:39] doggensteinn: @iandooleytv if slacks turns out being corrupt that like Danerys killin everyone on her dragon. to me doesnt fit his character
[1:15:40] WHATtheINTERROBANG: Slacks is wrong
[1:15:40] Edszyer: Wtf Andrews is a real cop...
[1:15:40] joewelch29: andrews is the real cop here
[1:15:43] Zolothan: ok but this isn't a real issue
[1:15:45] xxx_SIG_xxx: bc he’s in possession
[1:15:47] SumDee_LumDee: imagine arguing with a real cop
[1:15:48] risingmafia_: lol this RP is great!
[1:15:48] Gio_Dtavio: are they telling a cop in real life he's doing his job wrong what the hell lol.
[1:15:49] CARPExxDiem: Hmm
[1:15:49] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: what lol
[1:15:49] Ikilledkenny91: This subject just needs an ooc convo lol
[1:15:51] StreamElements: https://gamersupps.gg/otk Use code “OTK” for 10% your purchase!
[1:15:51] octagonner: this isnt real life
[1:15:55] Chickenplucker26: Possession of stolen property is a crime
[1:15:58] gobbagooey: Andrews is about to run laps around him
[1:15:58] Vikarious_X: Man this is more about paperwork than policing lol
[1:16:00] Neekapkilla: Lol he is probably trolling Andrews for RP
[1:16:00] bruiseter: @joewelch29 do you think real cops know most laws?
[1:16:01] iyaoniichan: rp policing is different than irl because they need to allow for rp to happen
[1:16:02] AndHaka54: its interesting getting andrew point of view on irl cop protocal but yea gta rp rules arent really following it to a T
[1:16:02] Lite_Ice: whats wrong with sending a search warrant to get approved ?
[1:16:02] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: fake laws lol
[1:16:04] jasonbriggs: corrupt cops
[1:16:05] WhoIsD33z: people using "andrews is a real cop" when its in gta rp LUL
[1:16:05] kyleeeeeee_: MAX LULW
[1:16:07] MacVane: @octagonner it is when the captains tell them to write up a report
[1:16:09] yobson: if you find someone stood over a dead body with 12 stab wounds holding a bloody knife how do you know he's the one who stabbed him? he could've just picked up the knife and slipped in the blood
[1:16:11] lilbuddy__: Taykum?
[1:16:13] lajmenno: @joewelch29 yeah but this aint real life, so it's different
[1:16:13] lilbuddy__: Taykum?
[1:16:13] IanDooleyTV: @doggensteinn I agree. He's a pretty straight character. He's playing this role well. I just think if I worked for him, I'd be sus right now, personally
[1:16:15] HeyMeghan: damn. this DOJ loves cockblocking the officers
[1:16:15] Violetbonees: esfandAK
[1:16:16] sugoimm: Ask chatgpt
[1:16:17] Largely_Sauce: It doesn't have to be real life, he's just talking about what makes sense in this situation
[1:16:19] WHATtheINTERROBANG: this might be the 1st time i think Turner might understand this right away
[1:16:19] octagonner: @MacVane it actually still isn't real life
[1:16:20] taraannee: well f the hypothetical this man had 90lbs of weed, irl solely the amount would get AT LEAST intent to distribute
[1:16:24] BoogieAnimal: what if he is the mule though?
[1:16:27] FreakTheMedic: that’s when you specifically write a search warrant for pd items Cheer100
[1:16:27] TheCombatantWombat: Slack is playing the devils advocate, he's going to try and disagree with everything chat
[1:16:28] lucidifous: @bruiseter I think they have a pretty good idea of what it takes to get a search warrant
[1:16:28] unanimous_night: Ssaab knows Five0 is a cop, Ssaab is prob RPing slacks being mistaken, it's ok
[1:16:30] yeem22: Andrew's was spitting 100% fax let him cook
[1:16:30] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: RP a cop should be real then not fake 🤷🏻‍♂️
[1:16:31] pkwhiz: multiple keys of weed...... lol
[1:16:32] MacVane: @octagonner i'm saying they want them to RP like it is during reports but then they do this
[1:16:32] SmugPls: yes but raiding is also rp, just because it doesnt facilitate more crime directly for that person doesnt mean its not rp
[1:16:39] Joongi_: Of course LULW
[1:16:42] omascas: 40 fucking kilos isn't multiple things?????
[1:16:44] GladMit: this isnt suppose to line up with irl laws chat every1 breathe
[1:16:44] loldoodlol: chat confusing real police with RP police? impossible Pog
[1:16:45] Kettopossum: monkaW
[1:16:46] Cowlowries: +1 rule
[1:16:49] Zolothan: if you're done talking about ruth, might as well patrol
[1:16:49] modooc56: @WhoIsD33z True this is not IRL but ruth is acting like it is sooo...
[1:16:54] beefydrapey: 42 kilos is insane lol
[1:16:55] pawneefour: chat is dumb. You can't just use the fact that Andrews is a cop irl as a reason to do whatever he says in RP
[1:16:55] HoneyBK: these current captains are idiots
[1:17:03] DViousGaming: Do they need a warrant to do the raid?
[1:17:05] doggensteinn: @iandooleytv i feel like theres more crumbs that lead me to believe ruth is corrupt. erratic behavior lately
[1:17:07] IanDooleyTV: This shift is understaffed and we got 5 LEOs on a Rooftop. XD
[1:17:08] thegummibearmassacre: hmmMeeting  󠀀
[1:17:09] MacVane: @pawneefour thats not what people are doing
[1:17:11] risingmafia_: chat iot RP not real life this is going to still play out in to something cool
[1:17:11] WhoIsD33z: @WhoIsD33z no she is not bro that is literally her whole character
[1:17:12] latexcatfish: “fruits of a poisonous tree”
[1:17:16] OutlawStar_x: pepeSmoke
[1:17:22] lucidifous: @pawneefour No one said do whatever he says
[1:17:23] WHATtheINTERROBANG: warrants are lower bar for sure
[1:17:23] Cthyllah: You guys know that real life laws do not equal RP Server rules, laws, and mechanics, right ? okay. it might seem obvious and simple to have answers to, but its not.
[1:17:23] singsyng: I want to hear Slack's scenario where a search warrant WOULD be permissible here on NoPixel
[1:17:24] missbuttins: someone human & beige @esfandtv
[1:17:26] Chickenplucker26: Possession of stolen property is illegal. The only way to clear your name is to give it back to the owner and to confess who you got it from.
[1:17:26] ens0mniac: this analogy of PD equipment doesn’t really make sense for the weed thing
[1:17:28] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: then they are RP fake cops? if it’s RP cops it should be real not made up lol LOGIC
[1:17:28] wavy__________________: slacks to busy with relationship rp to be a captain
[1:17:28] zyzzzo: Classic DAP for asking for warrant
[1:17:30] Xierany: Listen to the IRL cop, he knows
[1:17:37] IanDooleyTV: @doggensteinn oh dont get me wrong, i dont think slacks is like corrupt or anything. I just feel like he's siding with her a LOT right now.
[1:17:38] mclovins1g: peepoPopcorn peepoPopcorn peepoPopcorn
[1:17:44] omascas: Side tracked? 40 kilos is not sidetracked
[1:17:44] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: irl cop knows his shit.
[1:17:47] gobbagooey: I mean Andrews was one of the highest on command in 3.0
[1:17:48] cixsion_98: @zyzzzo what does DAP mean
[1:17:48] whatdoooing: Lmao chatter calls chat dumb bro ur one of us OMEGALUL
[1:17:53] Androzin: Did they talk about ruth stalking them off duty? lmao
[1:17:56] zZeliel: Corrupt captains sticking with each other OMEGALUL

[1:17:58] cixsion_98: @cixsion_98 new to rp
[1:17:59] offbrand: this is not real life its based aropund game mechanics
[1:18:00] JefeVergas: rp cop Slacks vs real life cop Andrews who’s tryna actually tell him how it’s supposed to be conducted lol
[1:18:01] thegummibearmassacre: D:
[1:18:02] qrs_complex: @EsfandTV you need more arrests to meet quota
[1:18:03] zyzzzo: cixsion_98 Decisive Action Point
[1:18:07] WHATtheINTERROBANG: yea him saying colluding is wild
[1:18:09] PokeMom019: Oof
[1:18:14] HoneyBK: she’s the one that was spying on YOU ALL
[1:18:14] JustSomeAsianGuyWithADog: lookUp
[1:18:17] miketwng: ayo this drama is juicy
[1:18:18] Vikarious_X: @cixsion_98 Disciplinary Action Points
[1:18:18] beefydrapey: @cixsion_98 disciplinary action point maybe
[1:18:18] dreggy69: @IanDooleyTV slacks seems like hes going super passive considering hes had his own complaints about ruth
[1:18:20] cixsion_98: @zyzzzo ty bro
[1:18:20] doggensteinn: @iandooleytv i agree. he’s playing devils advocate kinda. turner is really against ruth now. slacks is the voice of reason tho.
[1:18:22] DViousGaming: Even if the warrant were to get denied, why would it be an issue?
[1:18:23] rickosaurus_rex: can you ask to talk about this OOC so you guys can 100% say what you need to?
[1:18:26] Xierany: @doggensteinn They are all the same rank so he can't go against her to hard, has to be diplomatic
[1:18:27] zyzzzo: cixsion_98 (Disciplinary Action Point) < real one
[1:18:27] jdotno: bad captains will have a wide impact, doesn't mean they are colluding
[1:18:27] MacVane: @offbrand clearly not because Slacks is saying its IMPOSSIBLE to carry that much weed when its literally in the game
[1:18:27] loldoodlol: video game??? not real life??? whoooaaaa Pog
[1:18:31] chrollolucilfer741: Ruth is an incompetent bully :
[1:18:37] k9_goliath: Police Strike and Picket
[1:18:39] lucidifous: Slacks just trying to hold things together
[1:18:39] Nataweenie: slacks is a captain, he cant just talk down on his fellow captains. thats why he's trying to hear them out but also letting them know where she comes from as a captiain
[1:18:39] jhopps12: @rickosaurus_rex it's RP
[1:18:40] lajmenno: Chat, remember it's not real. It's a fictional world, within a game.
[1:18:41] singsyng: andrew's sounds confused irl
[1:18:42] modooc56: Small Kappa
[1:18:45] nickdrawsstuff: @Xierany He can go against her if he has the backing of pd majority
[1:18:49] Zenysa: they should do a team building boot camp!
[1:18:50] ethanmn1280: I wonder what hes gonna say about ruth being off duty spying
[1:18:50] Brakon: cop punishment is way to harsh when you do something small wrong ppl getting daps
[1:18:51] redmistintheair: that rock needs to fall on ruth o7
[1:18:57] offbrand: @MacVane youre absolutly right about that and i think slacks is wrong on trhat point
[1:18:58] risingmafia_: her RP is going to be so great i cant wait to see it unfold
[1:18:58] ultramicdo: people in chat don't understand leadership in general, and why Slacks can't just be like "you're right I hate her too"
[1:18:59] bobdang07hd: Funny to see how overly invested people get, go outside and touch grass. If theres snow dig until you find grass
[1:18:59] Orbilion: CoolStoryBob
[1:19:00] WhoIsD33z: @MacVane thats the point he is saying its impossible because he is trying to acknowledge ooc that it is a game mechanic issue that they need to fix
[1:19:00] MackPlays: Does he know she’s following you guys?!
[1:19:00] Vengy: NODDERS
[1:19:01] pawneefour: @macvane literally what chat is doing
[1:19:02] ViciousRumor: Chat, what happened this morning with the PD presence on Grove St this morning at Mr K's house?
[1:19:02] guilt_: sheisty talks too much lmao
[1:19:02] icephrogg: are yall going to mention she went off duty to spy on yall
[1:19:03] Loco_Cubano: what about Ruth following you guys off duty in a cruiser? o.o
[1:19:05] satanicstrike: Hes crooked or he wants to be chief
[1:19:05] IanDooleyTV: @doggensteinn Slacks and Turner are easily some of my favorites. I think Esfand is absolutely killing it. I think Cornwood is the main character to me.
[1:19:05] Solrest: Ruth being the heel is pretty interesting really
[1:19:06] tenacious_xd: KEEP UT ANONYMOUS
[1:19:06] RumPilot: mmhmm
[1:19:06] AbeFroman2: remember rpers can also put in emotions
[1:19:07] M__Wolfe: bring up ruth of duty in the cop car
[1:19:07] doggensteinn: @xierany it fits with slacks character. reasonable and sympathetic at the same time
[1:19:09] mclovins1g: OOOO
[1:19:10] Loco_Cubano: oh here we go
[1:19:11] PAJAMA_MONSTER: here we go
[1:19:12] Unholy13: Does andrews stream?
[1:19:12] rickosaurus_rex: some of it is, but some of it isnt. Esfand said that before, abotu people losing the  passion and not showing up
[1:19:12] lucksdead: We investigated ourselves and found no problems Kappa
[1:19:13] KrazyKefka: PepeLaugh
[1:19:13] daddyhardtears: tbh I bet Turner would be more on deck to help than Slacks is at this point lol

[1:19:17] zZeliel: OOOO
