[1:20:18] DeltacEU: probably
[1:20:18] kevinzhao7: light trucks are banned or is it small trucks only why they made suv
[1:20:21] lb215: its emissions basted
[1:20:21] rc48636: worst challenge u have done?
[1:20:23] pine4pplepizz4: NODDERS
[1:20:24] Ronja_Piratentochter: luckily i love in germany and can walk most of my duties
[1:20:24] ollie21c: big cars are sick
[1:20:27] BobTheMartin: @DarkViperAU It's not that they get more money, they don't need to meet emission and safety standards, also it has been like that for 30 years in US and you see cars in GTA V
[1:20:27] JAR_s_: Tbh it can be bad but not really
[1:20:29] mantuxxltu123: driving a small car is much more fun
[1:20:31] X6UR: its quite a trend in the uk as well, most cars are either suvs or hatchbacks
[1:20:32] gio_back15: no jump is crazy
[1:20:33] GameRollGTA: There’s like 10 huge vehicles in the trailer lol
[1:20:34] Alrow__: matto only needs a dumptruck…. arse

[1:20:36] MrSmooth360: good thing gta 6 still has old and new cars alike
[1:20:38] nutricious_secret_admirer: gta will have just as many super cars, its what people like
[1:20:40] matthewoher69: Womp womp
[1:20:42] Shpluj: SUV = Super Ugly Vehicle
[1:20:43] intelati: The high hoods just piss me off
[1:20:44] TheSovietLord: yeah they made that thing with larger cars class as trucks or whatever so they can have higher gas emissions
[1:20:46] BobTheMartin: @DarkViperAU It's not that they get more money, they don't need to meet emission and safety standards, also it has been like that for 30 years in US and you see cars in GTA V
[1:20:48] PurifiedShino: Americans just over compensating
[1:20:49] mikturnal: we even get them here in europe, its so stupid

[1:20:54] arnav_pundale: doesnt Trevor kill the plot after woards?
[1:20:54] JackOzy: amen
[1:20:54] Hey_Left: and hit bikers
[1:20:54] WackyFolf: @kevinzhao7 Light trucks, which includes pickups and SUVs, don't have to meet certain EPA standards.
[1:20:56] DeltacEU: they are so sick that people are willing to die for them, bad joke i know
[1:20:56] SKC_Car: @DarkViperAU Florida has no vehicular inspection; unlike other states which requires every 2 years; u can quite literally drive anything on florida
[1:21:00] SanamLP: I also take up space and pollute
[1:21:04] axhov: Assuming you saw that video "these stupid trucks are literally killing us"
[1:21:07] g1steezy: @shpluj Accurate
[1:21:10] BobTheMartin: That's what I wrote LUL
[1:21:12] X6UR: matto doesnt want to be seen as a soccer mom
[1:21:13] KaajSaap: The trucks are cheaper to make
[1:21:14] MintyRiver1: they acknowledge the change but I don't think they will. The game would just be too boring
[1:21:14] rc48636: the hardest challenge u have don’t?
[1:21:16] BobTheMartin: Well ye
[1:21:17] arnav_pundale: the cars were just drifting
[1:21:17] SKC_Car: There's no safety/emissions inspection in florida
[1:21:18] deanothebeano69: are you 100% this?
[1:21:21] lb215: austin mini is the best car. small and is like a go cart on tracks
[1:21:22] mikturnal: matto only reading the headline LUL
[1:21:24] safsaf998: Same could be said for 99% of cars out there
[1:21:31] mantuxxltu123: @SKC_Car thats crazy that a developed state does that
[1:21:33] DeltacEU: @mikturnal we do? modCheck not in estonia yet
[1:21:35] pablothedawg: have you played all gta games?
[1:21:36] BobTheMartin: You don't school me on automotive Matt LUL
[1:21:37] mikturnal: great channel in general
[1:21:39] RisingProtostar: I like my crossover, and it doesn't use much more gas than a sedan. Easier on my knees and is about the same size.
[1:21:40] Alrow__: how do i become darkviperau
[1:21:44] JackOzy: matto Orange pilled I see
[1:21:44] ryse99: only suv car i like is the new Mazda cx60 n 90
[1:21:45] Wryfrost: Video in question: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN7mSXMruEo
[1:21:52] ThirdGen87x2: I can understand the stance but the average cruise ship emits the same emissions per day as 1,800,000 cars running all day long and no one bats an eye
[1:21:57] MrSmooth360: @BobTheMartin dviperLUL
[1:21:58] ryse99: tho I have jdm wagon Xd
[1:22:00] mikturnal: @DeltacEU i see them rarely parked in my city. blocking all the sidewalks Daijoubu
[1:22:01] loburyakaua: Matt when speedrun GTA London 1961?
[1:22:06] SanamLP: Matto I thought you were gonna wear shirts more often?
[1:22:09] X6UR: can we instead talk about how electric vehicles are larger pollutants than any other car with a combustion engine?
[1:22:10] yellowbullet100: @Wryfrost thanks for sharing
[1:22:12] SKC_Car: @mantuxxltu123 Don't believe neither the FL current gov wants to change it neither their inhabitants
[1:22:13] pablothegoat661: dviperWave what was the game you were playing yesterday
[1:22:14] icymeltedmini24: These big ugly numbers get advertised so much in Scotland it's horrid
[1:22:16] WackyFolf: If I recall correctly, the EPA pushed regulations around the 70s because of the oil crisis to push auto manufacturers to make smaller cars. Light trucks, which includes SUVs and pickups, were exempt, however, so automakers have just been making more of those since then.
[1:22:18] anikun2k10: @SKC_Car how else is the mythical florida man supposed to exist?
[1:22:19] BobTheMartin: This streamer never gapped a spark plug in his life Kappa
[1:22:20] HACCAHO: @DarkViperAU hey Matt, what was your old car? that one before current
[1:22:21] INTRLINKD1: like you matto
[1:22:26] kevinzhao7: large vehicle for storage space
[1:22:30] Alrow__: where can you play gta 2?
[1:22:31] mantuxxltu123: cruise ships are inferior way of transport
[1:22:38] natehascrashed: all cars look like range rovers, i hate it
[1:22:40] jamesmca420: big car go voom voom
[1:22:52] DeltacEU: @mikturnal go to croatia, all the sidewalks are just cars dviperLUL
[1:22:58] PurifiedShino: Everything has to be bigger in the US for some reason.
[1:22:59] arnav_pundale: how did Oil not rub out until now?
[1:23:02] BobTheMartin: @DarkViperAU Did you know import laws are screwed because of Bill Gates LUL
[1:23:03] PushyMcButtons: there *is* and incentive to be the bigger/heavier vehicle in a collision
[1:23:06] arnav_pundale: *run
[1:23:10] mikturnal: @DeltacEU monkaSHAKE
[1:23:11] X6UR: @natehascrashed theyre more reliable than them tho
[1:23:11] WooFerNando: Why is this guy talking over the cutscene? How rude
[1:23:11] Kevingh92: The Maibatsu Monstrosity!
[1:23:16] WooFerNando: Ive never seen this before
[1:23:16] nanuqsaurus_: Suv like that can't be drive on most franch's road, a youtuber tried, they thought they hae accident at each car encounter
[1:23:22] kevinzhao7: now w/ ev is worse
[1:23:25] MidnightDelusion: large cars make people feel "safe"
[1:23:25] Alrow__: these large dumptrucks
[1:23:26] safsaf998: The Hummer EV looks nice
[1:23:28] shady_tribal: people I’m Europe love their small cars lol
[1:23:28] kyle_mbAU09: I happy that Australia is getting all the big us cars
[1:23:29] MostSane: I have a large truck and a small truck, sounds like a personal opinion
[1:23:32] SKC_Car: Actually in the states u buy a bigger car when u have a family; since everyone drive huge bricks; if u get in a crash u are safer on a bigger car; even if u have only 1 kid
[1:23:33] PushyMcButtons: large cars and bottled water
[1:23:37] kyle_mbAU09: and not crap Chinese stuff
[1:23:39] nibbalis: LightViper
[1:23:40] INTRLINKD1: bigger truck = better luck in gta speedruns. this has been scientifically proven
[1:23:42] arnav_pundale: in India, the cars are all smaller than the cars in Europe
[1:23:47] Eddd: hey, have you thought about grinding for a WR in this game?
[1:23:49] WackyFolf: @SKC_Car Unfortunately it's a negative feedback loop
[1:23:49] PurifiedShino: Have you seen their portions  sizes?
[1:23:49] HACCAHO: Sadge
[1:23:54] Wryfrost: It's a bit more nuanced than that but still
[1:24:04] anikun2k10: @SKC_Car you buy a bigger car to protect yourself from the bigger cars
[1:24:05] gameoholic101: in England trucks are rare because of the narrow rounds due to not a lot of land, but in America there’s loads of land
[1:24:06] shady_tribal: it’s the new meta matto it will make u slightly better than average
[1:24:08] outlander619: suvs are everwhere even in europe redsDespair
[1:24:09] escrow3: @arnav_pundale there are trucks everywhere in the city what do you mean
[1:24:12] PanCakeIdiot14: those cars are only good for big families who travel a lot i.e. my family
[1:24:15] FluxOxklint: @DarkViperAU How long are you planning on streaming today?
[1:24:18] Alrow__: matto loves europe confirmed?
[1:24:20] kevinzhao7: How Big Will the car be overtime?
[1:24:23] DeltacEU: NOPERS they are just compensating
[1:24:25] lgfrazer: The perfect solution- government subsidized electric unicycles for everyone!
[1:24:25] arnav_pundale: are you gonna kill the guy?
[1:24:26] Hey_Left: thats a nice ramble
[1:24:28] lb215: bigger cars are a status thing too
[1:24:29] Gruftmade: Never understood these SUV abominations. Even with your usual family a station wagon would be enough.
[1:24:31] BobTheMartin: Wait are you telling me solution to climate change are not 3 ton electric vehicles piloted by people who are trained in a small shitbox?
[1:24:32] Abdiel_Kavash: If you have a smaller car it is easier to dodge though HahaThink
[1:24:33] GOTOKART: Saying that they arent practical makes no sense maybe for some people but for big familys its very practical @DarkViperAU
[1:24:35] cattogun97: But I am tall, I need more leg room
[1:24:37] X6UR: @gameoholic101 theyre mainly owned by farmers or people that think are hard
[1:24:38] WackyFolf: @PanCakeIdiot14 Even then, minivans are lighter vehicles than can do the job just as well
[1:24:40] Man__toy: It has been a status symbol as well. Everyone is showing off the big TVs, big vehicles, big houses
[1:24:43] Ronja_Piratentochter: small cars for the win. give me a mini cooper, a fiat 500 or so and i'll be happy like a kid in the candy store
[1:24:45] KaajSaap: In Europe there are so few of those trucks, because we even have higher road tax
[1:24:46] BobTheMartin: D:
[1:24:47] DeltacEU: OMEGALUL
[1:24:48] kevinzhao7: Them door

[1:24:49] DeltacEU: they chances
[1:24:49] sixtyshadesofpaulandjeff: WHAT
[1:24:51] INTRLINKD1: are you saying pickup trucks are in a cold war rn?
[1:24:55] BenniCubed: explosive doors
[1:24:55] Shpluj: there goes the door
[1:24:58] ben_games08: F
[1:24:58] angryginge28: I have school in 6 hours should I go to bed or keep watching this?
[1:25:06] MZTC6293gg: i always wanted a motorcycle and i wont change my mind even if it will be hard to get
[1:25:06] MrSmooth360: I understand those who have businesses/ work in industries where they need a larger car... but no one needs a pick-up truck as a grocery-getter
[1:25:07] BobTheMartin: Footage ruined dviperSad
[1:25:09] arnav_pundale: @escrow3 which city do you live in in India?

[1:25:28] angryginge28: I will stay
[1:25:31] Wryfrost: @angryginge28 Set volume to minimum and go to sleep
[1:25:33] pablothedawg: more weight handles snow better
[1:25:33] WackyFolf: ANY 2WD car on snow tires will outperform an SUV on all-seasons in the snow
[1:25:34] SKC_Car: Actually SUVS have less interior space than a hatchback
[1:25:35] kyle_mbAU09: silly matto
[1:25:36] DeltacEU: dviperSmart get a snow mobile
[1:25:36] koen_05: Ground clearance?
[1:25:36] mantuxxltu123: it depends on the tires and the suspension mainly
[1:25:36] PushyMcButtons: with a higher center of gravity
[1:25:37] peterlepancake: I feel like that’s not correct lol
[1:25:39] BobTheMartin: A tiny vitara will do better than big fucc SUV
[1:25:42] arnav_pundale: you need a 4 wheel drive for the sno
[1:25:43] MrSmooth360: I have a 2 door with AWD that does just fine in the snow
[1:25:44] TakeNoShift: More weight, bigger tires, more traction. ???
[1:25:45] tomo2016tomo: Most SUVs are 4 wheel drive so will be better for snow
[1:25:45] pablothegoat661: when is the next chaos run ???
[1:25:45] Fossabot: @pablothegoat661 Chaos is streamed approximately once every week. You can watch previous episodes here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAnJ4ZuTYaeGnAUfO_PnRaWmWyLcuyzoX
[1:25:46] kyle_mbAU09: and sedan will do worse that a sub
[1:25:48] nanuqsaurus_: on SUV, is the gravity center too high so it is risky??
[1:25:53] GOTOKART: Most SUVs have AWD An in most cases AWD helps alot in the snow
[1:25:54] safsaf998: Bigger cars = bigger wheels = better traction
[1:25:57] SKC_Car: If u need something bigger for any reason; Crossover > Suv
[1:25:58] gerradynn: an audi a series with snow tires will out perform any SUV in the snow
[1:26:02] PanCakeIdiot14: @PanCakeIdiot14 yes and no, we had a minivan but used our suburban more because of its small differences, either way i agree that 99% of people would be more than fien with a minivan at most
[1:26:02] adamx79: how do you feel about people who say Michael used Franklin? I think that’s not true at all after all Franklin went to his house after complications
[1:26:04] xXHinjaXx: just ride a bicycle

[1:26:11] ThirdGen87x2: I’m assuming you’re excluding commercially necessary vehicles in this opinion. also have you looked at the average traffic in North America? not saying half ton trucks aren’t over populated but most dry smaller crossover suvs
[1:26:13] arnav_pundale: @pablothegoat661 he just finished season 7, so not for a while
[1:26:15] mantuxxltu123: suv's are just road cars disguised as offroad trucks
[1:26:21] ollie21c: most suvs are 4wd and better ground clearance though
[1:26:21] BobTheMartin: Source: It was revealed to me in a dream
[1:26:22] marvinprince: them small cars be sling though
[1:26:24] koen_05: @xxhinjaxx Are you Dutch?
[1:26:27] natehascrashed: the other way round if anything
[1:26:30] marvinprince: sliding
[1:26:31] Wryfrost: Being an SUV instead of some other car doesn't make it better in the snow. That said, SUVs tend to be All Wheel Drive, heavier, and have higher ride heights, all of which DO help with snow. There are better ways of dealing with snow than getting a bigger car but I digress
[1:26:33] xXHinjaXx: sure
[1:26:33] MrSmooth360: the size doesn't matter, the drive train does
[1:26:33] deanothebeano69: is this 100%
[1:26:35] DeltacEU: @BobTheMartin ok i trust you
[1:26:37] thomas579: I like minivans, because it means that my bigass family does not need to take 2 cars to go anywhere
[1:26:38] StaticMan83: i have a super tiny 2 wheel drive car that handles snow easy cus it rides on top rather than pushing it out of the way
[1:26:45] tertl75: I have a truck and a little car. I prefer the car in winter. The truck tends to slide more when slowing down on snow and ice.
[1:26:45] regynate: hi
[1:26:46] KatzeRegi: Most SUVs are pretty crap at offroad and adjacent stuff
[1:26:46] ollie21c: australian talking about snow btw lol
[1:26:47] tomo1612: That's wrong: SUVs don't absorb energy and crumple so the passengers of SUVs take all the damage and die more, and it is incompatible with smaller cars so they get crushed instead of softening th blow
[1:26:47] GOTOKART: also saying that they arent practical makes no sense maybe for some people but for big familys its very practical more people more seats @DarkViperAU
[1:26:50] MZTC6293gg: just drive a monster truck

[1:27:07] Man__toy: Heaver vehicles means more energy to stop, meaning faster speeds during collision, meaning less safe
[1:27:08] harvest_yes: i have a 4 door sadan perfect dont want anything bigger
[1:27:12] tomo1612: SUVs are'nt safer for no-one, they aren't designed to crumple and smaller cars are designed to but the SUVs aren't so they just kill everyone

[1:27:33] kyle_mbAU09: you car won’t be as good in snow then a Mercedes suv the suv has awd more grip and trucks can be safer matters in what circumstances because to the person in the truck they could go over some little car matters the situation
[1:27:33] mascahui: Truck are good in dealing with accidents once they happen but very very bad at avoiding them...
[1:27:33] mikturnal: lets get back to the game chat dviperComfy
[1:27:35] BobTheMartin: @nanuqsaurus_ Cybertruck is safe only if you don't have bones

[1:27:48] Shpluj: SUV just ran michael over

[1:27:53] DeltacEU: look at that tree chat
[1:27:58] arnav_pundale: that were some great fysics
[1:28:00] MrSmooth360: @fort_gamerau some smaller cars have AWD as well
[1:28:00] kevinzhao7: suv are easier to see but when close is harder
[1:28:01] Hey_Left: and you got a hella bigger hood
[1:28:01] DeltacEU: it's so beautiful
[1:28:02] cattogun97: You mean we have the high ground in an SUV?
[1:28:08] marvinprince: no, sedan too run you over
[1:28:10] cold_play1278: Nightsticks are now in stocks
[1:28:13] boneking1111: if all cars were the same size then everyone would be safer but just the people in the big cars are safe
[1:28:16] shady_tribal: that’s why bigger cars have blind spot warnings
[1:28:16] MostSane: OK?
[1:28:16] MZTC6293gg: or a realy fast vechicle that cant stop on time  so lets just not drive cars
[1:28:16] ChrisOnA6: which would make the person driving safer
[1:28:17] regynate: I know a perfect solution: buy a tank dviperNod
[1:28:17] deanothebeano69: no it's harder for things to slow you down
[1:28:19] mascahui: Truck are good in dealing with accidents once they happen but very very bad at avoiding them...
[1:28:19] MidnightDelusion: SUV is likely to hit smaller beings
[1:28:22] ollie21c: bigger always better
[1:28:24] KaajSaap: You can never convince people who like BIG cars that they are objectively worse for 95% of people
[1:28:25] huskymaddog: Higher driving position feels nice though
[1:28:25] Lenny_R6: if everyone drives an SUV then all of this will be solved Kappa
[1:28:25] big_w4ter: Never do you see motorcycle kills family of 4
[1:28:27] retrolendo: More fast moving Mass ist not saver. It is physics
[1:28:28] WackyFolf: @SKC_Car Those "SUVs" are crossovers. The definition of an SUV is a wagon-like body on a pickup frame, like the Ford Expedition or Lexus LX like you mentioned.
[1:28:30] ThirdGen87x2: I don’t think you’ve checked the stats in the proper locations for this one matto
[1:28:31] StaticMan83: big cars suck in all ways imo
[1:28:32] SKC_Car: @MostSane how Im I wrong, most work trucks are body on frame; most "city" suvs are unibody
[1:28:33] cattogun97: "It's over pedestrian, I have the high ground"
[1:28:33] OversampleReality: dviperWut nymnCorn
[1:28:36] dengostolemybaby: These people are confusing ur own safety with general safety. You are dafer sitting inside but everyone else is mkre likely to get injured
[1:28:37] JAR_s_: Nah a bike is going to demolish an sure
[1:28:39] Alrow__: junk in the trunk
[1:28:40] arnav_pundale: i think SUV's are great, and a SUV is gonna be my first car
[1:28:41] DeltacEU: oh boi chatto is in chaos now
[1:28:41] safsaf998: @ollie21c that's what she said
[1:28:43] mikturnal: @cattogun97 LUL
[1:28:43] nanuqsaurus_: like i said, some SUV are most tanks than cars
[1:28:48] jonathan001x: F=ma
[1:28:48] WackyFolf: I'm excited for this rable
[1:28:48] KatzeRegi: When you park people trying to cross can't see stuff
[1:28:49] angryginge28: suv better as more chance to hit and run
[1:28:49] anikun2k10: this is the most heated i have seen chat in a hot minute
[1:28:52] PurifiedShino: We can now tell who the Yanks are in chat. 😂
[1:28:53] deanothebeano69: there's rambles tonight?
[1:28:54] BobTheMartin: @DarkViperAU Just tell them if everyone drives an SUV you are not the safe just cuz you have one
[1:28:57] DeltacEU: The gate opened Pog
[1:28:58] trims3: Get a helicopter!
[1:29:00] FluxOxklint: @DarkViperAU I got a feeling this is gonna be a hard mission...
[1:29:04] pine4pplepizz4: 😂
[1:29:04] arnav_pundale: do you do rambles every stream?
[1:29:06] ChrisOnA6: Matto has 14 pages for us by the sounds of things
[1:29:10] lefthandlance: he can’t see you typing in YouTube chat stop typing keven skinner
[1:29:11] mascahui: Truck are good in dealing with accidents once they happen but very very bad at avoiding them...
[1:29:11] SKC_Car: @WackyFolf well if see it that way, but most suvs nowdays are not suvs; they are clearly an oversized hatchback
[1:29:11] Alrow__: I’m not a Yankee
[1:29:12] jamesmca420: will someone please think of the children dviperPats
[1:29:12] microtransactivision: If you ever buy SUV I'ma have to unsubscribe
[1:29:12] MostSane: @skc_car your trying to stick "unibody" to "suv"
[1:29:15] darkj_ev: hmm do you already know in your head when the next big obstacle will come or are you just going along until it comes
[1:29:15] TakeNoShift: Higher weight, larger wheels and therefore more traction. A heavier vehicle with appropriately sized tires is going to carve through the snow better than a lighter vehicle.
[1:29:16] mantuxxltu123: and the cars will only get heavier because of the batteries
[1:29:18] Gruftmade: Yeah, SUVs have all-wheel frive...so what? You can get normal cars with all-wheel drive too. Should be more than enough for the normal-use case.
[1:29:19] nanuqsaurus_: hey you need to climb on this one!!
[1:29:27] doejoey: trucks/suvs are only safer for the people that driving in them. and it puts everyone who are NOT in suvs/trucks in more danger. society would genuienly be better if not for these big SUVs and trucks
[1:29:28] MrSmooth360: @BobTheMartin If everyone is a super, no one is dviperNod
[1:29:30] SKC_Car: @MostSane arent most suvs unibody today -.-
[1:29:32] BobTheMartin: @DarkViperAU Just tell them if everyone drives an SUV you are not the safe just cuz you have one LUL
[1:29:37] PushyMcButtons: now, *vans* on the other hand......
[1:29:39] DeltacEU: NODDIES not just bikes is a good channel
[1:29:40] angryginge28: don’t you need to go up the ladder in this middiom
[1:29:40] WackyFolf: @SKC_Car Most of the things marketed as SUVs are crossovers, which are bigger cars made on smaller car platforms, like you said
[1:29:44] kyle_mbAU09: @mantuxxltu123 perfectly said
[1:29:47] Wryfrost: Yes!
[1:29:48] tomo2016tomo: You have greater force, so will have a greater chance of ploughing through what you hit, rather than stopping, so the decceleration will be slower, so more likely to survive
[1:29:50] Wryfrost: That's exactly it!
[1:29:53] outlander619: Can somebody link the Video?
[1:29:57] tomo2016tomo: And I hate SUVs
[1:29:59] ThirdGen87x2: if you’re applying any amount of bias due to the YouTube trend of whistling dips**ts it won’t be properly argued.
[1:30:01] INTRLINKD1: in texas you basically have to learn to drive or stay home lol
[1:30:02] EminGTR: That is a good video
[1:30:03] DeltacEU: how will you get up dviperHmm
[1:30:05] natehascrashed: can you bike wall climb for this mission please :D
[1:30:06] Hey_Left: oh no, climb
[1:30:07] MintyRiver1: SUVs suck. At least trucks do serve some purpose in shipping and whatnot. SUVs are there to do the exact same thing as regular smaller cars but only making the road much more dangerous for the majority of other people
[1:30:07] kevinzhao7: F
[1:30:07] BobTheMartin: LUL
[1:30:08] SKC_Car: @WackyFolf yeah that's what im saying, most suvs are not suvs, but since they are suvs they do a terrible job being a suv, since they are mostly unibody
[1:30:10] Wryfrost: Video in question: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN7mSXMruEo
[1:30:11] JAR_s_: Oh no
[1:30:13] OversampleReality: dviperHmmm
[1:30:16] JAR_s_: dviperSad dviperDead
[1:30:16] b3ntl3y0_0: Ho no
[1:30:16] sixtyshadesofpaulandjeff: lol rip
[1:30:17] ollie21c: Lets settle this: SUVs are sick crossover SUVs are not
[1:30:18] DeltacEU: can you drive into it?
[1:30:18] Alrow__: Americans are nice people
[1:30:18] xxzombotechxx: How hot it is in AU today ?
[1:30:19] nanuqsaurus_: here come the fun!
[1:30:21] kevinzhao7: Crash with car
[1:30:23] JAR_s_: dviperDead dviperDead dviperDead dviperDead
[1:30:26] GameRollGTA: smash through it with a car
[1:30:26] arnav_pundale: hah, you cant jump now

[1:30:30] luke11500: dizzyThink
[1:30:32] kyle_mbAU09: @tomo2016tomo why don’t hate suvs
[1:30:33] PurifiedShino: Hmm
[1:30:36] kevinzhao7: Helicopter?
[1:30:37] Gruftmade: And as demonstrated by some of the comments: The sense of higher safety (better in snow, better in collisions etc.) will probably lead to more accidents XD
[1:30:37] MrSmooth360: this is Mr. Richards
[1:30:41] Wryfrost: @luke11500 Cat!
[1:30:41] puptime: miikarBomb mslpBean themffCool swirreSip maicaWoah
[1:30:42] DeltacEU: dviperLUL matt was so zoned in on the conversation that he forgot
[1:30:46] WackyFolf: @SKC_Car They're bad at both being SUVs and being passenger cars, yeah
[1:30:48] arnav_pundale: why leaave the mission?
[1:30:48] shady_tribal: in the uk only big vehicles are 8 seater cars or vans (smaller business own the vans)
[1:30:49] b3ntl3y0_0: NotLikeThis
[1:30:49] cold_play1278: mom thinks I'm sleeping
[1:30:50] kevinzhao7: get a small one
[1:30:50] JAR_s_: Well time to quit this challenge imposibke dviperDead dviperDead
[1:30:52] natehascrashed: dont keep using copters, boring lol

[1:30:56] Hey_Left: heli is too ez, try bike Kappa
[1:30:57] MrSmooth360: Matt, this is not ballad of roccco
[1:30:58] GameRollGTA: does the fence not break if you crash into it?
[1:31:02] mikturnal: blimp dviperCheck
[1:31:03] PurifiedShino: Blimp strat?
[1:31:05] GOTOKART: Yeah i agree but saying that they arent practical is kinda ignorant
[1:31:07] deanothebeano69: dviperGib
[1:31:11] DeltacEU: @MrSmooth360 he would still have to get over the fence
[1:31:11] INTRLINKD1: an SUV would smash through ez
[1:31:12] BobTheMartin: @DarkViperAU Just tell all the KKona s in chat if everyone drives an SUV you are not the safe just cuz you have one LUL
[1:31:13] kevinzhao7: Big oof
[1:31:16] PushyMcButtons: ... anyone know where there's two dviperHmmm dviperHmm ?
[1:31:19] MrSmooth360: this is Mr. Richards
[1:31:19] mantuxxltu123: wont the heli spook the guards?
[1:31:20] shady_tribal: parachute?
[1:31:21] trims3: What if you don't activate the yellow dot whilst inside the heli?
[1:31:24] robln_dabank: Use cheats matto
[1:31:25] darkj_ev: infinite glide start from mount chilliad?
[1:31:27] nanuqsaurus_: so a car on the fence alert guards, but not a f**** chopper??

[1:31:38] arnav_pundale: youtube is really taking pay back for people using Ad blockers
[1:31:41] INTRLINKD1: just grow a pair and phase through i tlike a real man
[1:31:46] yellowbullet100: im suprised theres no blimp emote
[1:31:48] MrSmooth360: @DeltacEU yes, but he said the wrong mission name which is important for the video
[1:31:49] SKC_Car: @WackyFolf Nobody needs a SUV; most people that "need an SUV" in reality need a crossover; if u need all terrain; buy a damn pickup truck
[1:31:50] X6UR: On the topic of cars. Electric vehicles have been producing more pollution than any other vehicle with a combustion engine because of how much lithium has to be dug out. The batteries in electric vehicles are not recyclable or able to be used for anything else.
[1:31:53] PurifiedShino: Doing this challenge really goes to show two mechanics we greatly overlook actually is a big deal.
[1:31:53] angryginge28: Michael crazy
[1:31:53] BobTheMartin: Still might be there
[1:31:57] Hey_Left: @darkj_ev did he tried glide strat so far?
[1:32:01] afonso_111: Its Always in the  supposed "easy" missions
[1:32:03] aodegard132978: darkViperAu almost like DarkScrewYou
[1:32:04] DeltacEU: @MrSmooth360 NODDIES true, try to make him notice
[1:32:13] LividGreaser: try finding buzzard at noose facility
[1:32:16] turtlesarebeast: turtlesarebeast is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to DarkViperAU's community! They've gifted a total of 1 in the channel! 
[1:32:16] turtlesarebeast: turtlesarebeast gifted a Tier 1 sub to justgeorge9300! 
[1:32:18] shady_tribal: just teleport we won’t tell YouTube
[1:32:20] mikturnal: @X6UR thats just wrong lol its not 2013 anymore
[1:32:21] ChannelMiner: The first time I swapped to trevor after this mission blew my mind
[1:32:28] DeltacEU: Soub dviperGift

[1:32:49] darkj_ev: @Hey_Left noo not in this run at least. I don't know if he has ever tried it
[1:32:49] ttvctpg: will you do more interactions with Twitch chat kind of like DougDoug
[1:32:52] tomo2016tomo: @fort_gamerau Most are ugly, and a lot of people buy them for status. I find them quite pointless, if you need 4wd, buy a an offroader. If you want space buy an estate (station wagon). If you're a builder/ farmer buy a truck. If you want style buy a sports car. SUVs  and their owners irritate me.
[1:32:56] Hey_Left: theres already a heli there lmao
[1:33:02] regynate: okay back to sleep dviperTired
[1:33:03] icymeltedmini24: Cos this game was programmed by children

[1:33:13] abrahamstinkyham: Use a suppressor on your gun and take out the 2 guards then drive your car through the fence
[1:33:13] BobTheMartin: To all the SUV fans in chat. If literally eveyone drives SUV, you are not super safe for having one too
[1:33:16] arnav_pundale: i love the look and design of a SUV
[1:33:21] PushyMcButtons: @icymeltedmini24 tweens*

[1:35:09] PotatoeHX: qtcSpin
[1:35:10] kyle_mbAU09: @tomo2016tomo they are the most invalid reasons heaps of people don’t get them for status they get them for practicality a suv holds a family has good stalemate better ground clearance than a sedan of wagon
[1:35:15] X6UR: @mikturnal It may not be, but look at where the US get their lithium ion batteries, China. And then the batteries have to be transported to the US. driven to the location and then put into a car. Its all the same for European car manufacturers
[1:35:15] DeltacEU: @MrSmooth360 dviperSit ok, i just thought i could waste some points for good
[1:35:18] rachelphoenix23: dviperGain dviperGain dviperGain

[1:36:48] trims3: Isn't a helicoptrler a bit cheap tho? Try it without
[1:36:49] alexduro_99: did you had to jump or climb at any point already???
[1:36:51] X6UR: @fort_gamerau A 7/8 seater wagon would look weird since they're basically sedans with a rear of a hatchback, and theyd be quite longer than usual
[1:36:53] billboshane_833: are you allowed to climb ladders
[1:36:58] Fossabot: dviperWave Have Amazon Prime and want to sub for free? Link your account to Twitch at twitch.amazon.com/prime and subscribe here: twitch.tv/subs/darkviperau dviperHappy
[1:37:00] PurifiedShino: This challenge really goes to show how important small mechanics like jumping & climbing really get taken for granted by us as gamers.
[1:37:04] natehascrashed: @alexduro_99 he had to climb once
[1:37:06] Longshanks_1690: @billboshane_833 Noooo
[1:37:06] arnav_pundale: @BobTheMartin Volvo is chinease? from when?

[1:37:18] GameRollGTA: CyberTruck’s are the culmination of everything wrong with SUV’s

[1:37:40] MZTC6293gg: than batman was a serial murderer

[1:37:51] lucksasul: @BobTheMartin yeah i know that broski. thats unfortune, buttttt they are still very safe. even newest ones
[1:37:54] mantuxxltu123: it depends how long is the from of the suv
[1:37:54] 9ach: U have a lot of blind angles
[1:37:54] retrolendo: The Mass is the Problem
[1:37:57] PurifiedShino: Ever sit on the second level of a bus and it looks like you're going to crash?
[1:37:57] icymeltedmini24: I think this calls for ms paint matto
[1:37:58] pierrecto: The first time the team dviperSad
[1:37:59] angryginge28: who tf actually cares about hitting people
[1:37:59] PushyMcButtons: @cattogun97 that's not better than directly seeing the road
[1:38:01] X6UR: @arnav_pundale Its a swedish brand but owned by a chinese company
[1:38:04] iCriEvreTim: It's criminal that regulations encourage SUVs
[1:38:06] microtransactivision: They kill more because you always run them over when you hit them
[1:38:07] ThisSilverSpoon: we should drive and replace all vehicles with hot wheels
[1:38:10] MostSane: If you drive it with no common sense, yes
[1:38:10] SKC_Car: @DarkViperAU most people that "need an SUV" need a crossover in reality
[1:38:10] 613jord: true it’s a big difference
[1:38:12] finjer_gamer: yea yea take for example trucks their wayy high and ya just cant see all the way down forward
[1:38:13] Wryfrost: The car is higher up, there's more stuff blocking your line of sight, and the cars are so tall that they push people UNDER the car instead of up onto the hood
[1:38:18] pine4pplepizz4: Tru
[1:38:23] tomaskobra: but maybe small cars dont kill as many people only because they do less damage?
[1:38:24] KaajSaap: It also applies to children, there are instances of people running their own children over in their driveways
[1:38:24] safsaf998: Do u have data to confirm that claim
[1:38:27] angryginge28: suvs look caller tho
[1:38:27] shady_tribal: larger vehicles like trucks literally have warning signs so people be careful due to blind spots
[1:38:29] tomo1612: @DarkViperAU did you hear of the time Mark Rober put toy animals on a road to test who would run them over and 83% of SUV drivers swerved to hit them
[1:38:31] luke11500: makes sense
[1:38:32] BobTheMartin: I can see more out of a work truck than new SUV LUL
[1:38:33] arnav_pundale: @BobTheMartin i knew MG was chinees, but i didnt know volvo was
[1:38:33] Techno_Fred: whats the source for that claim that deaths have risen equally as suvs got  popular
[1:38:38] SKC_Car: @safsaf998 yeah, tons actually
[1:38:41] Spect3r777: @x6ur 7 seater wagons already exist, they have rear facing seats in the trunk. The mercedes eclass wagon is the only one that still offers it tho
[1:38:42] VojtechStrnad: don't forget to save
[1:38:44] nutricious_secret_admirer: correlation = causation LULW
[1:38:46] retrolendo: SUV drivers have small pepe
[1:38:46] PurifiedShino: Find a Sandking XL & prove it in game. 😂
[1:38:49] X6UR: Matto, it all depends by what suv youre talking about, there are small, mid and large suvs
[1:38:50] koen_05: Save
[1:38:51] icymeltedmini24: Oh it's almost like 1am i should probably sleep or something
[1:38:54] mantuxxltu123: they push people under the car
[1:38:57] aodegard132978: @natehascrashed it’s not the same
[1:38:58] kylemsguy: New sedans are also way bigger than they used to be...
[1:38:58] ShadowFB_: wtf where is you data comming from? because SUVs were only 3rd leading auto deaths so wtf lol
[1:39:05] plasmap0wer: i actually remember someone on twitter strawmanning someone's concerns about big trucks and suvs causing child deaths by saying that theyre just trying to excuse lazy parents
[1:39:07] ryse99: sounds some of y’all haven’t driven an suv and it shows
[1:39:07] DeltacEU: no one eat the chopper this time dviperPoint
[1:39:20] angryginge28: who tf genuinely cares about hitting people maybe they shouldn’t be in the road
[1:39:32] andrewlee816: bro did someone actually say that LMAO
[1:39:33] Sereiya_: @nutricious_secret_admirer The causal connectio is obvious in the statistics as it is the SUV drivers who drive over people. There were tests too.
[1:39:34] g1steezy: Like the government having a legal theft system
[1:39:35] pixelatedcorgi: save game
[1:39:39] X6UR: @spect3r777 I know but if were talking about comfort it wouldnt be as good, the only good 7 seater wagon i remember would be a mercedes e class w211
[1:39:39] Reloe: @DeltacEU but I'm hungry
[1:39:40] Wryfrost: @angryginge28 Ah yes, if people don't want to die, they shouldn't exist in public :|
[1:39:40] andrewlee816: i’m gay and that’s funny
[1:39:40] microtransactivision: If you drive a normal car and hit someone with it, they will usually fall onto the windshield or the hood, depending on speed
[1:39:42] jspiscool: AMERICAA 🇺🇸🦅🦅
[1:39:47] arnav_pundale: @DarkViperAU i think SUV's are great as a family car, and if you know how to drive you wont hit a ped
[1:39:48] pixelatedcorgi: nice
[1:39:49] andrewlee816: why did somebody say that
[1:39:50] mantuxxltu123: a lot of suv's in gta iv
[1:39:51] koen_05: I like sedans the most
[1:39:52] Fatcat411: @andrewlee816 they need to catch up to the times lmao
[1:39:54] Bamb00z: lost and damned makes no sense. the whole script is like it's written by an intern or a kid
[1:39:56] shady_tribal: @andrewlee816 the internet is a strange place
[1:40:00] yellowbullet100: dviperAlive dviperAlive
[1:40:04] PushyMcButtons: to be fair, there are low sports cars with long front-ends - similar visibility issues
[1:40:06] DeltacEU: @Reloe but there's so much more yummy food
[1:40:10] doejoey: are you gonna put "suv hater" in your twitter bio?
[1:40:10] MostSane: BabyRage it's not a electric hybrid 2 door with 14in rims
[1:40:12] kyle_mbAU09: @x6ur Mercedes are probably the best cars sometimes
[1:40:15] trims3: Don't activate the dot whilst in the heli?
[1:40:18] mantuxxltu123: coups feel the best to drive
[1:40:18] licensetodraw: Why is SUV pronounced by saying each letter out loud, why isnt it pronounced 'soov' or something
[1:40:22] JAR_s_: @yellowbullet100 nuh uh dviperDead dviperDead
[1:40:24] big_w4ter: Public transport would be safer anyways
[1:40:29] BobTheMartin: @arnav_pundale average person doesn't give a fuck about driving and all of you have lower visibility
[1:40:29] natehascrashed: pls can we stop with car chat now
[1:40:31] safsaf998: Google says that smaller cars kill far more people than bigger cars
[1:40:32] Wryfrost: @big_w4ter Amen
[1:40:36] WackyFolf: I’ve driven everything from a little Hyundai Accent to a Ford Expedition. SUVs undoubtedly have a visibility disadvantage
[1:40:37] retrolendo: SUV are Shit. No room in the Trunk. Needs more space and Benzin. And to much Mass. Where does the Energy Go in the Crash?
[1:40:40] Spect3r777: @x6ur true, but realistically people who need the space should just drive minivans rather than huge suvs
[1:40:50] ThisIsTME_Guy: helicopter battke
[1:40:52] kyle_mbAU09: @licensetodraw because it’s an ebriviation for “sport utility vehicle “
[1:40:53] Sereiya_: @big_w4ter Cheaper, more social and healthier too.
[1:40:54] Reloe: @BobTheMartin average person is also just a bad driver LUL
[1:40:55] PushyMcButtons: @natehascrashed gta - gonna talk autombiles?
[1:41:02] shady_tribal: @big_w4ter some countries should invest in it since in London public transport is pretty big
[1:41:05] DeltacEU: and then matt realizes he is on the wrong mission dviperSmart
[1:41:14] makkerone08: just buy a bicycle guys
[1:41:15] X6UR: @fort_gamerau I've got to agree with you on that one. one other company i'd say is pretty good would be Audi
[1:41:17] licensetodraw: @fort_gamerau abbreviations are pronounced as words. Like Radar or gif
[1:41:18] colocolo91_: Is ragdolling allowed?
[1:41:19] owen13847: hi matto
[1:41:20] PurifiedShino: plant c4 before hand?
[1:41:25] tessytessyy: I personally think everyone should just drive a cement mixer
[1:41:27] kyle_mbAU09: @spect3r777 minivans handle shit compared to a suv
[1:41:28] ThisSilverSpoon: boooo, rockstar why :c
[1:41:32] koen_05: Toyota Camry / corolla all the way 😎

[1:42:55] natehascrashed: @licensetodraw not always
[1:42:56] tomo2016tomo: @fort_gamerau But they aren't practical or fuel efficient. most 4x4s can hols a family comfortably. SUVs are the most pointless of all the cars. You've missed the point that if you want ground clearance, then get a 4x4. And a lot of suvs have less room than my volvo, and aren't as fast or efficient. They are rubbish. Why would you need ground clearance in a city? WHich is where suvs are suited for
[1:43:02] angryginge28: can you not just get out of the helicopter get into another car do the cutscene the get back in the helicopter

[1:45:46] angryginge28: I’m having a nut during the stream
[1:45:51] X6UR: @fort_gamerau SUV's have got to be one of the fastest body styles to become popular amongst families and other people

[1:46:06] owen13847: hello matto

[1:47:01] kyle_mbAU09: @x6ur thansk for proving my point more
[1:47:05] WackyFolf: it’s because they don’t sell anything else anymore. Ford doesn’t sell any passenger cars other than the Mustang

[1:50:07] PurifiedShino: You know who's a yank in chat because they're trying to defend SUVs.
[1:50:08] safsaf998: Kids not playing outside is probably a blessing, u don't have to deal with the noise
[1:50:10] slimboyphat: Yoo you got the new Fort Child crusher 3000?

[1:50:26] arnav_pundale: imagine if this works
[1:50:27] Liyo17: American buy Ford F-250 and use it for what its for like twice in its lifetime

[1:50:33] intwothevoidd: on the bridge?
[1:50:34] Assassin_frogo02: Do it closer
[1:50:34] Zoroxus47: I hope it de-spawns for my Lurk coins
[1:50:37] sentinel_2294: buzzard time
[1:50:37] mikturnal: delta heavily invested in this heli GoldPLZ
[1:50:37] Reloe: I'm following some channel that streams police car chases in the US and there's basically a broadcast daily 4Head
[1:50:38] tomo2016tomo: @X6UR Yes, but not many places snow enough to or at all to need 4wd, and still, get an offroader rather than suv as they are better in snow than suvs.
[1:50:40] Bamb00z: meanwhile i get made fun of for driving a smol city car / motorized shopping cart dviperShrug
[1:50:42] xiaplinger123: DEspawn now
[1:50:42] MrAlexCapone: I been looking what to eat with salmon while I watch you lol
[1:50:45] angryginge28: help it’s staining the bed sheet
[1:50:46] DeltacEU: @mikturnal NODDIES
[1:50:48] arnav_pundale: i think it will despawn
[1:50:48] bravopjeshkeman: was it yes it despawns or what cant remember
[1:50:50] Sereiya_: As european I'm always baffled at US "infrastructure". It's just blocks of either houses or one big supermarket or some industry, often without sidewalks even. No busses, no trains… hard to imagine living there, it looks almost dystopian.
[1:50:51] ohhitsaryan: lets see
[1:50:56] X6UR: @Liyo17 they usually just lift it, put underglow under and put on some chrome wheels
[1:50:57] weenie_69: wouldnt helicopters be a good strat for pacifist?
[1:50:58] comp_91: it dinidn't despawn
[1:51:03] DeltacEU: @mikturnal And i made bank

[1:51:21] comp_91: good
[1:51:25] djsalame: noo my points
[1:51:28] PanCakeIdiot14: @Sereiya_ it basically is a dystopia here shayyPain

[1:51:36] makkerone08: i won money thx matto for teaching me how to gamble properly
[1:51:37] Longshanks_1690: I should have gone all in lmao
[1:51:38] Liyo17: @Liyo17 And now its unusable for what its for, even better
[1:51:38] X6UR: @Sereiya_ I agree
[1:51:39] DeltacEU: dviperLUL My plan was to waste points during this stream
[1:51:39] Spect3r777: @sereiya_ The issue is that our cities grew in the 40s which is why they are centred around cars rather than people
[1:51:44] Zoroxus47: Glad it despawned that time
[1:51:51] mikturnal: @DeltacEU and how is that working out for you LUL
[1:51:57] arnav_pundale: i got 37 cp extra, was it worth it?
[1:51:58] MegaF1: Hi CuteDog
[1:51:58] PurifiedShino: Mods letting us Gamba? Let's go!
[1:51:59] Assassin_frogo02: Why Park it on the yellow circle
[1:52:01] natehascrashed: stop with car talk pls
[1:52:05] DeltacEU: @mikturnal +130k OMEGALUL
[1:52:06] MrSmooth360: My thoughts to the original question you brought up as to whether or not gta 6 is gonna have more large cars due to the shift in the u.s. is no, not really... since gta doesn't just have new cars, they have older cars as well
[1:52:11] Shpluj: whats a car
[1:52:12] trims3: Youre putting it way too far away
[1:52:18] ez__razer: dviperPolice
[1:52:18] X6UR: Matto what car do you have? I think ive watched a video of you showing it off once but cannot remember.
[1:52:19] andrewlee816: yes
[1:52:19] Zoroxus47: I got lurk coins
[1:52:20] BobTheMartin: They are gambling lurk coins matt
[1:52:23] Milk_FGC: I got like +200
[1:52:25] Longshanks_1690: We have points riding on it so yeah :p
[1:52:35] arnav_pundale: did the poll go live on yt too?
[1:52:35] xiaplinger123: dviperDead
[1:52:36] marvinprince: me have short term memory
[1:52:36] mantuxxltu123: park it next to the dot like the last time
[1:52:42] tomaskobra: I was saving 10 thousand points for a while, so I will use this opportunity to say that
[1:52:43] Dan45_5: NOT the lurk coins
[1:52:43] ez__razer: dviperPolice dviperPolice dviperPolice dviperPolice dviperPolice dviperPolice
[1:52:44] DeltacEU: the big question is. Will gta 6 have traffic jams
[1:52:44] BobTheMartin: LUL
[1:52:46] Zmonnk: have you tried asking it to not despawn
[1:52:46] NOTABISONORASNAKELOL82: Hey solomon
[1:52:49] owen13847: how you doing today?
[1:52:53] Sereiya_: @spect3r777 Yeah I looked at the history of it a while ago since it's a huge fight here in Germany all the god damn time. Our car lobby want's the very same.
[1:52:54] Nebe0719: yeah cant you save after landing the heli
[1:52:54] arnav_pundale: Twitch is like a gambling website
[1:52:59] makkerone08: chain it to a pole
[1:53:00] lilsad1312: just cheat matto XD
[1:53:03] tertl75: Um, strimmer, why don't you try parking it in the exact right spot?
[1:53:05] calzone2010: you should try beating this new thing where you beat the game as fast as possible
[1:53:12] notreallybread123: kuruW kuruKillMe kuruKillMe
[1:53:12] andrewlee816: i wanna gamble
[1:53:13] Bugkiller1: Put the helicopter in your pocket before stepping in the yellow circle
[1:53:14] Assassin_frogo02: Hope is well though been awhile since I've watched you live
[1:53:15] Eonyears: I didn't know we are betting
[1:53:15] PurifiedShino: Imagine if you got a Sandking XL in game and proved your point in this 11 year old game 😂
[1:53:16] Liyo17: @Sereiya_ As an American, I agree, it's incredibly annoying and inefficient. If you don't have a car your f*cked, which is litterally everyone under 16 years old
[1:53:16] bellar0516: I wonder if gta 6 will have speed bumps
[1:53:22] notreallybread123: dviperHappy dviperHappy dviperHappy dviperHappy dviperHappy

[1:53:47] andrewlee816: dviperDeaddviperDead
[1:53:48] calzone2010: what are you trying to do
[1:53:50] X6UR: @Liyo17 I think thats why some states allow 14 year olds to apply for a car license, which is crazy
[1:53:54] INTRLINKD1: save
[1:53:58] natehascrashed: can we ban the word SUV
[1:53:58] mantuxxltu123: that suv

[1:54:46] MayconFrr: push the heli with car after yellow dot?
[1:54:46] DeltacEU: @arnav_pundale he is doing a strat now that almost certainly spawns the heli so kinda pointless
[1:54:46] BobTheMartin: What if you push the Heli away from pole
[1:54:49] DisGracefulMoi: use a bike
[1:54:50] xyz_lloll: try plane
[1:54:51] logan2011567: dviperWave
[1:54:54] FumigatorGTA: after the cutscene move the helicopter with a car before entering it
[1:54:58] PurifiedShino: Hold up. There was a glitch with online where if you places C4 on an object it wouldn't despawn. I wonder if it will work in Story?
[1:54:58] cattogun97: dviperDead dviperDead dviperDead dviperDead dviperDead

[1:55:25] andrewlee816: go to the noose building
[1:55:26] INTRLINKD1: can u not steal a firetruck, climb it and jump over
[1:55:27] logan2011567: hi matto this is my first time watching you live dviperWave
[1:55:27] Dominik99: Because of its shape and health maybe a cargobob works ?

[1:55:32] Sereiya_: @Liyo17 I'm over 30 and don't even have a drivers license, never needed it lol. Can get anywhere with public transport, even in the current underfunded state it is. My dream is to have a really nice 50kmh E-Bike more on the countryside here. dviperDerp

[1:55:42] abrahamstinkyham: Trevor!!!!
[1:55:42] PushyMcButtons: dodge
[1:55:44] Liyo17: @Liyo17 14 years old is crazy, far from being mature enough. You have absolutely zero alternatives to cars, public transportation is terrible and walking is out of the question.
[1:55:46] angryginge28: cargobob will work
[1:55:47] arnav_pundale: make it longer and safer
[1:55:49] BobTheMartin: I forgot, is there a leave radius for that checkpoint?

[1:56:22] natehascrashed: buy it with trevor
[1:56:22] X6UR: Is matto gonna do a millionaire run on here just to get a heli?
[1:56:22] arnav_pundale: buy a buzzard
[1:56:23] Spect3r777: @sereiya_ interesting, never know that was a problem in Europe. Too bad that money is always the focus for guys in power
[1:56:24] mantuxxltu123: what if you wait for the heli to merge out of the ground
[1:56:25] corpsemaster666: check the noose building

[2:19:55] natehascrashed: you can get in a car and drive out
[2:19:56] MrHarlz_: isn’t there a mandatory jumping part to minor turbulence?
[2:20:00] dr_halsey_: in 2030: Gta 5 without walking

[2:20:10] porter1818: Its suprising how many streamers dont seem to think about a UPS untill its killed multiple streams

[2:20:22] mikturnal: is a ups just for battery backup?
[2:20:29] Fossabot: @bravopjeshkeman, Please turn off CAPS-LOCK. [warning]
[2:20:31] anikun2k10: depends on the capacity of the UPS
[2:20:32] maybeitsjayy: a UPS is jut like a little box that stores power that
[2:20:33] DeltacEU: 20 minutes to finish the speedrun
[2:20:37] maybeitsjayy: that'll last like 20 mins
[2:20:38] mikturnal: dviperNoted
[2:20:38] Roland__Deschain: do you have many haters?
[2:20:39] maybeitsjayy: once power goes out
[2:20:40] natehascrashed: @mikturnal it protec ts against surges
[2:20:40] PushyMcButtons: gives you more than enough time to proper shut-down

[2:20:56] Fossabot: Follow me at https://twitter.com/DarkViperAU for cute animal pictures, inane prattle and politics.
[2:20:59] MrHarlz_: @shady_tribal well it’s more a climb, when you need to climb the ladder in the plane
[2:21:01] DeltacEU: so it's a chonky battery
[2:21:05] sonicred09: Hopefully the song doesn't play that killed your run again
[2:21:06] PushyMcButtons: a battery inside a powerstrip
[2:21:13] arnav_pundale: oh no, not this mission
[2:21:18] mikturnal: whole house has a battery backup so i guess i dont need that LUL
[2:21:20] shady_tribal: @mrharlz_ oh yeah that may be an issue
[2:21:21] bravopjeshkeman: matto stack c4 to climb the ladder u said to remind u on pacifsts 2.0 stream
[2:21:23] IT3DDYl: It also Cleans up messy Power aswell
[2:21:24] charlie_chazzo: Matt, I think someone should make a mod where all the lines from gta is swapped with your funny catchphrases
[2:21:24] maybeitsjayy: god I hate this mission
[2:21:25] kevinf100: They don't hold a good charge for phones. Better ot buy one for that reason
[2:21:26] porter1818: UPS is a battery backup, but its instantaneous switches to battery therefore the name uninterruptible power supply
[2:21:34] PushyMcButtons: well, a very chonky powerstrip
[2:21:34] neonulled: I thought you were talking about the delivery service
[2:21:37] CrimsonCasualty: It only turns on when it detects the main power going off right?
[2:21:41] lilsad1312: dviperGun dviperDead
[2:21:42] bravopjeshkeman: matto stack c4 to climb the ladder u said to remind u on pacifsts 2.0 stream!

[2:22:24] Bamb00z: my laptop + router combo could run for something like 6 hours on my smol UPS. my main PC? 20 minutes
[2:22:25] Wryfrost: My UPS lasts like half a second. It's not even worth having lmao
[2:22:26] Dan45_5: @natehascrashed ok
[2:22:30] natehascrashed: @mikturnal ikr, hey can i whisper you a question?
[2:22:30] mikturnal: thats pretty long

[2:22:33] Cold_War_Goat: that seems quite short
[2:22:34] Uncle_Reeko: also the batteries degrade over time, have to replace occasionally
[2:22:35] unknown_mouse7249: @x6ur oh crap yeah
[2:22:35] mikturnal: @natehascrashed sure
[2:22:40] TheXiled00: they're designed for a safe shutdown after an outage

[2:23:09] bellar0516: Idea: kifflom%
[2:23:10] DeltacEU: oh no my valorant game closed Kappa
[2:23:17] MrRubberToe69: 150$ - 200$ will buy a high quality UPS for a PC
[2:23:19] porter1818: @arnav_pundale like he said it depends on what you buy and what devices you have attached, for $50 you can get 15-20 minuets for the average pc, or for 10's of thoustands you can keep entire server racks running
[2:23:20] charlie_chazzo: matt do you have a charity that I could donate to since my dad recently passed away and I want to do something good
[2:23:26] PushyMcButtons: so I should first invest in a UPS before paying the utilities so I'm safe when they cut the power?
[2:23:31] kevinf100: I got one that will turn my PC off after a few mins incase I'm away
[2:23:35] maybeitsjayy: matto what do you think is the best way to advertise yourself as an editor? I'm struggling to find clients and dont know where to promote myself yk
[2:23:36] billboshane_833: i use to hate facual hair...then it grew on me
[2:23:36] Bamb00z: simplest way to think of it is "a laptop's battery... just for your desktop"
[2:23:45] DeltacEU: so how are you getting up the ladder?
[2:23:46] natehascrashed: @mikturnal thanks man dviperLove
[2:23:46] GameRollGTA: What mic do you have?

[2:44:35] KAREL99: wall bang
[2:44:36] Dan45_5: @itzcakiee I'm pretty certain you can't
[2:44:43] darkj_ev: in online you could teleport in the plane while standing on top of it by pressing the go in button but don't think the game recognizes the plane as a vehicle right now
[2:44:51] darkj_ev: maybe i remember wrong
[2:44:55] Dominik99: He probably died because of ur rockets ?
[2:44:58] arnav_pundale: he wont die

[2:45:27] Bamb00z: just a brainfart: could you save ontop of the plane? or does the game put you back in

[2:45:57] Doodieboy99: What?????
[2:45:59] Dan45_5: @MiksMoi That fails the mission
[2:46:01] edwardreaver: Did he try throwing the C4 up the ladder, then glitching with the RPG and then activating the C4 to kill the pilot?
[2:46:02] milaggy: try the thing where you jump and ragdoll on the roof
[2:46:03] aka_retr0__: Roll?
[2:46:12] Sidobamba4: roll
[2:46:13] opcertainty: the mission marker must be broken, no way its that low
[2:46:18] finjer_gamer: would taking cover work?
[2:46:18] Eddiefishie: @milaggy no jumping run
[2:46:20] jempel993: do a roll
[2:46:21] MrHarlz_: @darkviperau could you not try levitation glitch with the cars in the plane at the start to get up?
[2:46:23] Murphimself: roll is the jump button Kappa
[2:46:24] KAREL99: is not possible right ?
[2:46:25] gwr1000: just got here why cant u just go or be in the plane
[2:46:28] DeltacEU: dont think rockstar was that bad at placing waypoints
[2:46:28] X6UR: theres no point of doing this strat if it doesnt work, you need to get to the checkpoint before getting into the seat
[2:46:32] wolfman019: is the dot at the base of the ladder?
[2:46:37] leonkodheli17: It's easy, all you have to do is
[2:46:38] darkj_ev: :/
[2:46:38] MiksMoi: do u even know if it works

[2:50:31] mikturnal: bigshawtyblue go bed dviperGun
[2:50:35] bigshawtyblue: @deltaceu ahhh
[2:50:39] trims3: Levitation glitch with a truck? (joking)
[2:50:39] vaporwaved: maybe you have to put some behind you as well to straighten up the trajectory
[2:50:40] opcertainty: very doable
[2:50:40] mikturnal: LUL
[2:50:42] KAREL99: ALMOST
[2:50:43] marvinprince: close
[2:50:43] cattogun97: almost there

[2:50:50] exxrich: Cummies
[2:50:51] MiksMoi: have u tried climbing the ladder
[2:50:54] EliteTM23: just curious Could u use the rpg then set off the c4
[2:50:56] absolute_carnage: gotta be further back i think
[2:50:58] opcertainty: maybe run into the ladder after exploding?
[2:50:59] darkj_ev: this is so fakin cool
[2:51:02] afonso_111: its hard to find the perfect line
[2:51:04] bigshawtyblue: @mikturnal good to see you too! dviperLove
[2:51:04] Eddiefishie: @MiksMoi hes trying not to climb ladders lol
[2:51:05] DeltacEU: @mikturnal @bigshawtyblue why are we all awake aaaaa
[2:51:08] GarryGREY: Killing yourself is probably faster than jumping off every time
[2:51:11] charlie_chazzo: maybe try put one on the wall and angle yourself
[2:51:12] X6UR: what if you get into the cockpit area and trevor ragdolls down the ladder?
[2:51:14] INTRLINKD1: you'll do it and then die to the guy uptop bc you forgot to shoot him
[2:51:17] PurifiedShino: Could you activate the yellow dot from underneath from doing this?
[2:51:21] bigshawtyblue: @deltaceu as if it ain’t 4 am for you dviperPoint
[2:51:24] exxrich: dlneroH dlneroH dlneroH dlneroH dlneroH
[2:51:24] chrissy_whissy: dviperLost
[2:51:25] opcertainty: angle your body against the ladder so it forces you up
[2:51:26] mikturnal: @DeltacEU because good content dviperNom
[2:51:32] chrissy_whissy: dviperLurking
[2:51:33] DeltacEU: @bigshawtyblue that's why i said we
[2:51:43] alex122333456: Why wont u just skip this part by dying 3 times?
[2:51:43] opcertainty: Face the ladder Matto
[2:51:49] nanuqsaurus_: it is like minecraft tnt launcher xD
[2:51:52] ttvctpg: can you stick them on the ladder
[2:51:54] uzsiiee: this is gonna require some insnae rng dark viper doesnt have\
[2:51:54] PushyMcButtons: i think the placement was good until you shifted left at the end
[2:51:55] aka_retr0__: The angle is tricky
[2:51:56] pixelatedcorgi: the problem is the ladder is so narrow so theres not much room to work with
[2:51:56] KaptnOnTwitch: spawn Franklin, then make him drive into you and boost you
[2:51:56] DeltacEU: all under you dviperSmart
[2:52:01] bigshawtyblue: @mikturnal @deltaceu I’m here so I have background noise to fall asleep to.. bc if I don’t have that I’ll get nightmares
[2:52:01] PushyMcButtons: @ttvctpg nope
[2:52:02] KatzeRegi: Throw from behind the ladder?
[2:52:02] woobnstoobn: when you touched the ladder the dot moved to above you. but when you launched the dot shows below you.
[2:52:03] charlie_chazzo: put one on the wall and angle yourself
[2:52:11] veljkoj123: Maybe put one sticky firstly on the celing to bounce u down more then activate down ones
[2:52:12] nervinated: i think you need to center them a little better
[2:52:16] alex122333456: Why dont you just mission skip this part?
[2:52:17] PurifiedShino: C4 + RPG?
[2:52:17] X6UR: what if you shoot the rpg at the c4 once you throw them down?
[2:52:18] GenCartridge: you seem to be going semi-consistently to the left. maybe go to the right?
[2:52:18] PushyMcButtons: @PushyMcButtons nor that panel on the top part
[2:52:20] Wryfrost: It compounds with cars, ik that much
[2:52:23] JAR_s_: Use the jeeps?
[2:52:24] cxz_cxz_v9: wat if you make like acircle around you while being stuck on the ladder
[2:52:26] seals_victorious: Stop running out of plane just rpg yourself @darkviperau
[2:52:28] DeltacEU: @bigshawtyblue go away nightmares dviperPoint
[2:52:28] 39glitched: shoot the pilot first?
[2:52:28] ThirdGen87x2: dviperLurk dviperLurking
[2:52:29] cxz_cxz_v9: so you dont fall to the side
[2:52:35] MegaF1: the ladder have no physics chat
[2:52:35] opcertainty: wow
[2:52:37] darkj_ev: oh that was so close
[2:52:37] JAR_s_: Use the jeeps
[2:52:38] X6UR: way better
[2:52:38] evballss: Better
[2:52:40] unknown_mouse7249: Ye
[2:52:40] Techno_Fred: looks better
[2:52:41] PushyMcButtons: damn that was close
[2:52:43] bigshawtyblue: @deltaceu told them but they’re stubborn
[2:52:43] opcertainty: I think it was more controllable
[2:52:43] bravopjeshkeman: Matto i just noticed u keep JUMPING out the pane it does the jump animmation too
[2:52:43] mikturnal: @bigshawtyblue some people prefer whale sounds, you prefer matto sounds LUL
[2:52:44] GameRollGTA: definitely more directional
[2:52:45] MrHarlz_: I mean you diddnt get flung into the side
[2:52:45] nanuqsaurus_: WWAAYYYY better way way better
[2:52:45] INTRLINKD1: better
[2:52:46] fadoalanzokaaa: seems betteer for aiming
[2:52:46] Murphimself: it was more accurate
[2:52:46] dumb_penguin3: yes
[2:52:48] unknown_mouse7249: Wayyyyyy better
[2:52:50] Reloe: more controllable but height harder
[2:52:52] ch0sen01ne: seems same dviperShrug
[2:52:54] h0xhi: More consistent maybe
[2:52:54] evballss: See stacking does work
[2:52:54] PurifiedShino: It's more controlled
[2:52:56] Dominik99: Looked a bjt better
[2:53:01] pixelatedcorgi: would using an rpg to blow them up get you higher or is it the same as a gun
[2:53:02] classix106: gn matto gn chatto, time to lurk and sleep dviperLove
[2:53:04] X6UR: put 8 in the same spot you just put them in and then 1 just under the ladder
[2:53:05] trims3: Def moe accurate
[2:53:06] Abdiel_Kavash: Trevor Space Program LUL
[2:53:07] 39glitched: what if you put one c4 behind the ladder?
[2:53:07] pixelatedcorgi: or does that not even work
[2:53:08] INTRLINKD1: place closer to ladder
[2:53:10] cxz_cxz_v9: wat if you blow up the c4s with rpg
[2:53:10] PushyMcButtons: any chance first person would make a difference?
[2:53:13] MostRoyal: can you place C4 along the steps of the ladder?
[2:53:15] ThirdGen87x2: dviperChecking dviperBlueball dviperChecking
[2:53:16] PurifiedShino: C4 + RPG?
[2:53:19] alex122333456: shoot the c4 that u want to explode first instead of just clicking on the button that makes it so that it blows up the first one u dropped on the ground
[2:53:24] Fossabot: dviperWave Have Amazon Prime and want to sub for free? Link your account to Twitch at twitch.amazon.com/prime and subscribe here: twitch.tv/subs/darkviperau dviperHappy
[2:53:27] DeltacEU: @PushyMcButtons yes, it would make it unwatchable
[2:53:33] opcertainty: bad angle
[2:53:33] leonkodheli17: Matto, just try to
[2:53:35] Techno_Fred: doable
[2:53:36] JAR_s_: Jeep
[2:53:37] jempel993: Next challenge idea only jumps no walking
[2:53:38] bravopjeshkeman: Matto i just noticed u keep JUMPING out the pane it does the jump animmation too?
[2:53:41] logan_blob: just no clip duh
[2:53:43] PushyMcButtons: @DeltacEU dviperLUL
[2:53:44] ttvctpg: try sticking c4 on ladder
[2:53:44] evballss: Go a little more to thr right
[2:53:50] MrHarlz_: put one inside the cockpit as a finale C4 to launch u up
[2:53:50] INTRLINKD1: a little closer to ladder matto
[2:53:51] nanuqsaurus_: more precise but lower
[2:53:55] JaniJohnny: Poor Trevor lmao
[2:53:56] LutriTink: c4 a tiny bit closer to the ladder?
[2:53:57] itsriley0011111: run towards the ladder and detonate it
[2:53:59] alex122333456: The car explosion can count as a extra c4 yknow
[2:54:00] opcertainty: rocket at your feet, aim at the bottom of the ladder, all C4 at same spot
[2:54:11] Dan45_5: Does C4 have to be set off by a gun? Is there any other explosive that doesn't require the gun?
[2:54:15] exxrich: @janijohnny  1 gazillion Trevor's have been sacrificed
[2:54:20] TorontoGeorge: what if you use the Jeep and c4 from that
[2:54:21] alex122333456: Use the car as a extra c4
[2:54:27] noisyai: right under the ladder
[2:54:31] nervinated: i think the angles is not steep enough
[2:54:35] opcertainty: almost
[2:54:39] DeltacEU: a bit too right
[2:54:43] Techno_Fred: face the ladder bro
[2:54:49] aka_retr0__: Not high enough
[2:54:53] mattmike15: Matto do a stack and 1 on either side and shoot the middle ones
[2:54:54] opcertainty: you need C4, that looked lower
[2:54:57] miinty254: what if you make like a U shape
[2:55:02] Murphimself: i would actually move away from the ladder, you seem to hit the ladder and bounce away
[2:55:04] Hey_Left: this is true rocket science
[2:55:06] alex122333456: How is trevor still alive after getting blown up 500 times?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
[2:55:07] 39glitched: chaining better ye
[2:55:09] mattmike15: Controlled explosion
[2:55:10] GameRollGTA: grenade launcher?
[2:55:11] KatzeRegi: The ladder has no collision, so you could throw the c4 from behind it?
[2:55:12] JAR_s_: Try usesing the jeeps
[2:55:13] nanuqsaurus_: it might be optical illusion ^^'
[2:55:16] DeltacEU: @alex122333456 meth
[2:55:17] JaniJohnny: Gotta be higher 😏
[2:55:23] makkerone08: C4 is definitely the way
[2:55:23] 39glitched: @alex122333456 any methhead can survive that
[2:55:25] INTRLINKD1: do a circle of c4 infront of ladder and stand closer to ladder
[2:55:25] X6UR: teleport gun would be useful right now
[2:55:27] mikturnal: pepeSmoke
[2:55:32] exxrich: This might be a wash
[2:55:33] Techno_Fred: put a bunch of C4 on the same spot directly under the ladder, and then face the ladder and make sure your in line with it, then look straight down and shoot the C4 with a pistol
[2:55:34] GenCartridge: can you clip into the ladder from the backside? so you clip upstairs?
[2:55:34] JAR_s_: Try the jeeps
[2:55:40] Nokipankahfer: can the movement of the plane impact ragdoll
[2:55:40] dumbbeast7: bruh i dont get it
[2:55:45] mattmike15: Place a stack and 1 on eirhwr side then shoot the middle matto try it
[2:55:51] BraveMicrobe38: yes
[2:55:53] PushyMcButtons: i'm holding out for levitation trick
[2:55:53] exxrich: I don't
[2:55:53] DeltacEU: we can't even give up because it's doable
[2:55:53] xtownhell: Why do you do this to yourself
[2:55:54] SquishyVicky: Let the voice of love take you higher
[2:55:55] itsriley0011111: get onto one of the jeep’s using c4 then use another to launch yourself up?
[2:55:56] afonso_111: the first time with chaining, went higher
[2:55:59] logan_blob: why don't you just climb the ladder dviperHappy
[2:55:59] X6UR: No
[2:56:01] finjer_gamer: try it
[2:56:04] Hey_Left: stack em at one spot
[2:56:05] jasvvy: seems cheaty
[2:56:05] kingmirjuno: LOL
[2:56:06] alex122333456: Well you are hanging not climbing so it doesnt count
[2:56:08] PushyMcButtons: touching the ladder has counted so far
[2:56:09] Techno_Fred: dont spread themaround
[2:56:26] opcertainty: rather than jumping out the plane, just explode yourself Matto
[2:56:26] lit__mas: Hello
[2:56:27] jempel993: just blow the car under the ladder the u blow u self up the car and then up the ledder
[2:56:30] nanuqsaurus_: i still think you should use the car, set it behind the ladder adn stick c4 on it.
[2:56:33] hokiboi: try like 3 3 3 formation
[2:56:35] alex122333456: Shoot the rocket at the car making it to explode the c4 aswell
[2:56:37] DeltacEU: and we will
[2:56:38] Hey_Left: focus the explosion
[2:56:43] PurifiedShino: Or do it right at the start of the animation before power turns off?
[2:56:48] X6UR: i dont think this will be as bad as the jewellery store
[2:56:49] mikturnal: im down for a 1000h stream dviperComfy
[2:56:50] leonkodheli17: Exit mission, then get more
[2:56:52] tomo2016tomo: could you test with more c4?
[2:56:52] vaporwaved: @nanuqsaurus_ car isn't accessible
[2:56:58] GameRollGTA: is a grenade launcher any more powerful or is that a waste of time?
[2:56:59] taikusuna: Maybe using the boxes to get higher?
[2:57:09] RAINBOWCREEPERKING: !gtavhours
[2:57:10] Fossabot: @RAINBOWCREEPERKING Matt has played GTAV for 10976 hours
[2:57:11] andrewthebishop: Maybe explode the vehicle so it’s at the base of the ladder, explode yourself on the vehicle, and explode up from there?
[2:57:13] makkerone08: put the first in front of the ladder and the second behind it and so on going back and forth, it should push u vertically in a more accurate way
[2:57:13] nanuqsaurus_: @vaporwaved move with explosive ^^'
[2:57:14] alex122333456: Just exit the mission and go to a gunstore i mean you have the time of your lifetime on this speedrun
[2:57:14] cold_play1278: at least in gta online u can hold 30 max grenades, c4
[2:57:15] rilster2010: try standing on the c4
[2:57:20] samesp96: Leave the mission and buy more C4 then
[2:57:21] gabriel_4020_: Go buy more C4 we can wait
[2:57:24] lit__mas: I watch you on YouTube and now I see you on twitch

[3:06:09] X6UR: why not mission skip? we never said you cant skip it
[3:06:11] huskymaddog: Still no jumps at least, just 2 climbs so far
[3:06:16] leonkodheli17: This is a miner problem
[3:06:19] PushyMcButtons: try once more to go down the ladder, but facing forward this time?
[3:06:28] DeltacEU: from now on lets cheat before trying to do stuff legit
[3:06:29] BenniCubed: but perhaps you could still fall back down to "undo" the climb and then try to oob taking over the controls?
[3:06:42] Hey_Left: rip
[3:06:44] PushyMcButtons: @DeltacEU but.... content
[3:06:44] makkerone08: this is so sad
[3:06:47] Hey_Left: i was not here
[3:06:47] looshHD: looshHD subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! What if you start climbing from standing on top of the car so you dont have to climb that much, or maybe just have to touch the ladder?
[3:06:48] Fossabot: Helllll Yeeaaahh dviperHappy

[3:07:42] PurifiedShino: What was the point in Dead Man Walking?
[3:07:42] Longshanks_1690: @brovengerful The mission where Michael has to pretend to be dead. You can only escape the building by climbing out a window
[3:07:42] PushyMcButtons: @X6UR i was curious if the mechanic was even in place - the top rung was lower than the opening in the floor
[3:07:48] Radnick: play the song!

[3:09:11] Spect3r777: If only there was a timer under your cam
[3:09:12] unknown_mouse7249: I had an alarm for 12 as in 00:00 and my stupendously stupid self set it for 12 in the day I only just realised its way past that time

[3:12:02] chugging_beans: is it scripted?
[3:12:02] pixelatedcorgi: uh oh
[3:12:03] Abdiel_Kavash: Is the plane actually moving during that? Does getting out early drop you more towards the land?
[3:12:04] Longshanks_1690: If you get out of the car now, you aren’t jumping
[3:12:05] 39glitched: dont think its possible
[3:12:10] darkj_ev: if you do lean forwards in a certain angle you gain extra distance. thats what car stunters use
[3:12:10] makkerone08: isn't parachuting just stepping out and falling?
[3:12:11] WooFerNando: Isn't he literally jumping from a plane right now??

[3:12:25] shtbox_canyon: @eddiefishie but he’s jumped from helis in the past
[3:12:25] alex122333456: Jump off the plane when its almost stable

[3:12:25] wolfdendoyz: Nah that's wild
[3:12:25] woot112: So close dviperDead

[3:12:33] silo2144: viper what advice could you give when going through a rough breakup?
[3:12:36] leon_hillen: is exiting the vehicle after it has left the place allowed?
[3:12:38] Murphimself: i mean i wouldnt call getiing out of a falling car a jump
[3:12:39] GarryGREY: I think it's scripted. You don't die by landing a car in the water normally
[3:12:40] ThirdGen87x2: @lzyelephant yeah, it’s rockstars fault dviperNod
[3:12:40] X6UR: yes its scripted as youre supposed to land it on land to comlete the mission challenge
[3:12:49] leonkodheli17: Try break boasting
[3:12:49] l_studios123: use Franklins ability dumbass
[3:12:50] MrSmooth360: you cannot survive in that car, it is indeed scripted

[3:12:58] chrispaulsburner: no
[3:13:01] alex122333456: tbh its falling out of a plane not jumping so you can fall off the plane
[3:13:01] MostRoyal: why not park your car on the edge and simply "get out of the car"
[3:13:02] PushyMcButtons: on the map you're clearly not
[3:13:03] atomictoasted: ITS IMPOSSIBLE
[3:13:04] evballss: No

[3:13:05] shtbox_canyon: get out of car last second
[3:13:05] Eddiefishie: character swap when u get close
[3:13:06] nervinated: it seems off that you die from it, so it might be
[3:13:08] chugging_beans: @l_studios123 not franklin tho
[3:13:10] LukesterGaming: radar*
[3:13:12] makkerone08: I think the game prevents you from going forward a certain distance
[3:13:12] maybeitsjayy: alt strat
[3:13:13] darkj_ev: f you do lean forwards in a certain angle you gain extra distance. thats what car stunters use
[3:13:18] kevinf100: Use your power and blow yourself out
[3:13:19] MrCallumX: dont go back maybe?
[3:13:20] leonkodheli17: Break boasting
[3:13:20] 39glitched: cant you rpg off of plane with ability

[3:13:22] X6UR: get a run up
[3:13:23] GarryGREY: The minimap doens't move at all. You're glued to that position
[3:13:24] INTRLINKD1: cant u just fall out of the plane
[3:13:24] ch0sen01ne: see the map u were not moving forward

[3:14:12] X6UR: you need to get a run up, reverse to the front of the plane and then drive out
[3:14:13] Longshanks_1690: Can you try reaching the other side of the lake instead?
[3:14:14] imnotarealhamster: Maybe reverse out
