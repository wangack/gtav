[1:57:02] ComfyAura: 109 on highway is pain rental is faster
[1:57:03] CopperKat: according to the mechanics only a 60-70 turbo works on this car but who knows
[1:57:10] CopperKat: thats what vinny said

[2:05:34] BlastedRoyal: PepeLa
[2:05:38] CopperKat: @ltl_wackman, believe it or not I think the moonshine is the precursor mechanics to making your own drug/meth. Every mechanic so far has been introduced by a lower level crime and then been part of the higher tier crime. I think the formula stuff is how drugs are gonna work.
[2:05:41] NikTw1tch: LMFAO
[2:05:44] Photocomfort: PepeLa
[2:05:49] 7las: Clueless harder

[2:06:03] vahtu: nah 4head dumb, easier now
[2:06:06] ltl_wackman: @CopperKat that totally makes sense. like moonshine itself doesnt seem that lucrative or interesting so i bet you're right
[2:06:06] i1_Ghost: x told devs to fix it
[2:06:07] Me4onyX: Damn it dont leak
[2:06:07] WeebRemover: it is

[2:06:10] Sparrowxz: it is
[2:06:10] ViaNaXTN: it is
[2:06:11] hemmorj: its easier
[2:06:12] sweetymonkey: they look easy now ye
[2:06:12] SameAsEveryOtherDay: It's larger, but you have more time
[2:06:13] Phoenix__08: yeah its easier
[2:06:14] themenk: there's no impossible ones anymore
[2:06:15] zemog_01: It is but he thinks its harder
[2:06:16] coolwhipice: It is 4head is just dumb
[2:06:16] mrozzyoz: 4head was doing ok by just spam clicking
[2:06:16] Mitashkii: should be less punishing
[2:06:17] ValuableBoring: youre less likely to get one that isnt solvable now

[2:06:19] 1evilshark: it is easier its just 4head
[2:06:20] numb3r13: more room for mistakes
[2:06:22] Mama_Mercy_FFXIV: It is. 4head is just dumb
[2:06:23] cxnt: More but it's 100% possible each time
[2:06:24] kleric1: @GrajciePacholy not easier lol
[2:06:24] RU8H: it doesnt seem as impossible any more
[2:06:26] linkitcraig: the old one had impossible ones
[2:06:27] prmanu: You can check
[2:06:29] BlastedRoyal: they made it less impossible
[2:06:31] hemmorj: 4head foheadDent
[2:06:31] DarnComputer: yeah and it seems like you get more time
[2:06:32] mandypyro: less chance of them being  impossible atleast
[2:06:35] Beafour: That does makes sense, more chances to fuck up without fucking the whole grid
[2:06:36] 2hopp: because its bigger more possible solutions
[2:06:36] Zhachi1250: Old system 1 mistake = fail, now you have chances to fix your errors
[2:06:37] bjerre6969: as long as it is only 3 colors it should be easier
[2:06:37] SpaceMetaFighterXD: I think it's supposed to make it less impossible
[2:06:38] CopperKat: @ltl_wackman, Yeah I think the idea of each person having their own recipe they have to figure out will be part of the drug making mechanic.
[2:06:39] 7thLettter: it looked easier
[2:06:40] Ciaaattt: i think its gonna be easier for you
[2:06:41] GrajciePacholy: @kleric1 it is, coz before they were impossible ones
[2:06:47] v6r_: @mandypyro YEP
[2:06:48] Pashinko: Almost no chance of impossible ones
[2:06:52] 2hopp: bigger area = more solutions
[2:06:52] djihtrax: @Zhachi1250 ^
[2:06:54] Celascion: it's easier, but the time factor remains the same, so less time to think
[2:06:54] 2hopp: not jus 1
[2:07:00] bjerre6969: do a bug report maybe?
[2:07:07] ibraas11: 130?
[2:07:17] ltl_wackman: copperkat imagine if there were specific optimal recipes linked to your character so no one could cheat. like i hope there really is genuine discovery like you said
[2:07:17] minich4rmander: try a turbo now?
[2:07:21] skedaddelr: i think this car would go 160-170 with a properly working turbo
[2:07:21] hemmorj: @ibraas11 bumps
[2:07:24] xx_josh0_xx: wtf its faster without the turbo
[2:07:29] BlastedRoyal: its hella dumb

[2:07:38] ComfyAura: mhm

[2:08:27] SameAsEveryOtherDay: Marty was suggesting a trade, I wonder what for.
[2:08:31] CopperKat: @ltl_wackman, Yeah I think Vinny and his people and Tuggz are the ones trying to crack the moonshine recipe and they'll have a big headstart on understanding the drug/meth mechanics.
[2:08:37] Zhachi1250: Either of you but in bug reports? If they aren't aware of it, how they going to know to fix it
[2:08:50] ComfyAura: classic stab city

[2:10:35] Gizmo_Johnston: did money runs change?
[2:10:36] CopperKat: @ltl_wackman, I think you're right that the recipe being custom to each person is so people can't cheat. I didn't even think of that but it makes perfect sense. Everyone has to do the same work to figure it out.
[2:10:38] MingsPrio: ming and fanny money runs
[2:10:42] kaexium: @Zhachi1250 so its a clean slate? wouldve though they would recycle the old bug fixes and old foundation unless it was too spaghetti'd
