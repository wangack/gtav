[0:45:23] TheRealStanchez: from what I've seen, most people don't specifically ask for a master mechanic, they just hope someone is on duty and available to do repairs and then pays whatever ends up being charged
[0:45:46] eborcurean: @TheRealStanchez well mosleys only allows master mechanics to work, but that doesn't mean everyone does.
[0:45:51] TumNarDok: what if for a vehicle strike you take their turbo XD
[0:46:03] TheRealStanchez: @eborcurean ah, that makes sense.  That was a critical piece of info I wasn't aware of
[0:46:28] eqnjn: @TumNarDok Actually genius to take turbo/transmission for VAF points

[0:47:23] TeraKIN: Mary set the repair cost to ensure that the guys at Moseley's can actually make a profit for their time and effort
[0:47:29] eborcurean: Also cars repair at diff amounts, so the taurus takes more parts than a cvpi. There's a lot of variables.

[4:15:43] JohnieP: Probably the best reaction I've seen to LEO taken hostage is the Angel/Stubble thing in 3.0 where Angel told Stubs over radio to hit the deck while PD opened fire on the offender(s). But that's imo.

[4:23:18] LSSJBen: curvyeHi @jordxnfair
[4:23:26] RobotsAndMaltLiquor: @random_viewer_55 The argument is that Brady disclosure, like qualified immunity, is not written into los santos law and thus if it must be written to apply, then there is no brady disclosure
