[5:11:17] simmeringteapot: what blueprints do you get from towing?
[5:11:21] almosteaster1: civ gangs biggest problem seem to be not moving information efficient and not jumping on their cards
[5:12:03] Ginoveli: garbage gurl and bin boi is a good combo name lol
[5:12:10] 42arc: @almosteaster1 they are not in a rush anyway, just doing 9-5 job
[5:13:07] justCoopp: who is the other girlie there?
[5:13:24] SyNxChaos: Is Towing and Sani two jobs that you can't work together that screws your rep?
[5:13:25] almosteaster1: @almosteaster1 depends on their goals. If they want a piece on some marked they have to get in as early as possible right
[5:13:26] 42arc: @justCoopp juliet
[5:13:45] simmeringteapot: ask for her number in case you need someone to run sani with
[5:14:03] N0Ne123: he can rob you to look
[5:14:04] Ginoveli: WDYM
[5:14:16] Shivie78: Civ gang wants to work towards stuff, but they also take time to have fun and fool around.

[5:14:53] FRAlex010: you only can do tier 3
[5:15:05] FRAlex010: go tow
[5:15:17] Bags94: better to start now tho eventually you'll have it over time
[5:15:33] Ginoveli: i think you started a trend with sani
[5:15:36] Ginoveli: so many workers now
[5:15:45] Hollowshaun: acieWADDLE
[5:15:47] almosteaster1: @almosteaster1 why
[5:15:56] 42arc: sani is very important, towing can be done by nunu eventually
[5:15:58] riccorohl: What do you need the rep for anyways?
[5:16:00] Bags94: you wont need it later ever?
[5:16:13] Ginoveli: kind of the meta currently i assume?

[5:19:26] j_pandy: @42arc you definitely need a partner (who doesn't want rep), the rep goes so much faster
[5:19:28] 42arc: 2 ppl jobs are bad for rp, it gets boring, 3 ppl is much more fun
[5:19:34] Shivie78: Good thing about sani is. There will always be a need for materials. They will always need stuff to build things.
