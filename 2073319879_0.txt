[0:26:16] CaptainFlapjack80: Crane is the voice of reasob
[0:26:19] Xierany: Crane is the main reason Max hasn't fired the Captains I'm sure
[0:26:20] MDM4ever1986HD: Denzel was fired before bike patrol
[0:26:26] CaptainFlapjack80: Reason
[0:26:27] ArenaKrusher: @TheShaunBro so much but tdlr - a commisoner is gonna get choosen to keep captains in check
[0:26:41] SeaOfEmpty: I mean that's how crane acts, not that he is

[0:27:54] MDM4ever1986HD: they could have highlighted it in another colour
[0:27:57] krisholborn2024: Ruth actually did earlier in the meeting with slacks and turner guess they both forgot
[0:27:58] jojaha: I look forward to Max going out with a bang, it will be so good. no idea what he plans but will be spicy

[0:29:14] Spec_GG: ^

[0:30:45] Picklz: i remember when they had eugune lure you down prune street and ambush you frm the roofs it was wild
[0:31:06] evil_bullett: it started a few months into 2.0

[0:32:52] Lord_Legolas: Angel would be good for watching PD as well
[0:33:01] Tritonesubstitution: Hmm
[0:33:08] Panos_97: Oh he's talking about the excessive force DAPs
[0:33:18] BfAleTitan: like you shouldn't get 5 daps for shooting a 1 life character
[0:33:35] MDM4ever1986HD: I love that channel perk
[0:33:39] DrDandelion: CaughtIn4K
[0:33:43] SeaOfEmpty: The zoom always gets me
[0:34:00] CaptainFlapjack80: I was hoping max would turn to snow to help shape the new pd just to bring it full circle lol
[0:34:06] krisholborn2024: I mean 1 lifer is still civ
[0:34:10] krisholborn2024: so they get treated like such
[0:34:12] MartMonster: a funny clip from the meeting last night https://clips.twitch.tv/RoughAttractiveLegMikeHogu-0NyrLeeIqGi_IVSY
[0:34:25] Spec_GG: which they have changed i think
[0:34:26] Sanivay: I think he wanted lesser and ya 60 days is way to much
[0:34:29] ManakinEU: 60 days is kinda crazy ngl
[0:34:31] lukievondukie: time to check the changes then
[0:34:32] Boylez: I find it so funny how cornwood is so deeply involved in this stuff too. So good
[0:34:32] MDM4ever1986HD: how can you dap someone who is a one-lifer? Donald Bush XXIV wanted to die
[0:34:33] miketwng: i blame Mr.K it all started with him
[0:34:37] Cujo71_: I think what Max is doing will be a good thing. Going to be a fun arc to watch
[0:34:41] Albert_Fn_Wesker: ugh

[0:34:52] ar0jit: Saab is very good but not pd running in this situation
[0:34:53] krisholborn2024: I also hate the “sbs” should come with less punishment
[0:34:55] Galileothe1: only a ping 3days alg EZ
[0:34:55] krisholborn2024: that’s also dumb
[0:34:58] StarWhistle517: i toasted my lemon poppyseed muffin mmmm
[0:35:04] NGVtv: Do you think the DAPs last to long? Just a question
[0:35:25] MDM4ever1986HD: @StarWhistle517 that sounds so nice
[0:35:27] vnxshh: I think that the only problem with the DAP stuff is straight to indefinite suspension, think it should have a few day suspension and if you dont learn then unlucky
[0:35:38] NGVtv: oh "yes" LUL
[0:35:44] krisholborn2024: the truth is HC can never win 3.0 no dps people complained 4.0 punishments they complajn
[0:35:45] Xierany: Since PD is struggling with the economy, say you could remove 1 DAP per 10k to the budget
[0:35:47] krisholborn2024: complain*
[0:35:49] StreamElements: Join Snow's Hotbox! https://discord.gg/Snow

[0:36:03] NGVtv: MASSIVE*
[0:36:06] NGVtv: o
[0:36:12] Sanivay: Arent they going to have to redefine major to minor?
[0:36:14] Panos_97: Too bad that two people had to be indefinitely suspended/fired for this to be enacted
[0:36:16] NGVtv: IMO 45 MAX idk.
[0:36:18] Xierany: Should be 15, 30, 45 imo
[0:36:19] Picklz: the major ones are prettty big issues tho
[0:36:20] Lord_Legolas: 20/40/60
[0:36:21] StephyFace: yeah
[0:36:21] FowlBirdman: what's the moderate to minor threshhold?
[0:36:22] ViewbotReportingforDuty: 15 - 30 - 45 is better proportion
[0:36:23] BaldHermit: It's all perspective based, 5 daps that last 60 days for any situation is crazy though, that 2 strikes and suspended. Think his big point is the RP punishment isn't in line with the OOC effect those punishments have
[0:36:23] cuccumberz: As someone who has been around the PD for a bit is the current state that bad compared to where it was in 2.0 and 3.0 around the same time?
[0:36:23] ManakinEU: 60 is so wild considering how the rest of the server is right
[0:36:23] DrDandelion: PepoDance dabs
[0:36:23] SmugPls: 60 is jsut too much, RP happens so fast
[0:36:25] miketwng: that's longer than the statutes of limitations loool

[0:36:45] H3nry001: classic
[0:36:46] quimmers: I'm thinking something like time off for good behaviour in prison, if you change during those 60 days that should be considered
[0:36:47] Sqwidlet: KEKW
[0:36:48] MDM4ever1986HD: moonmoon said it right https://www.twitch.tv/moonmoon/clip/TangentialResourcefulLattePogChamp-rYr71Gdh2HQPpQRL?filter=clips&range=7d&sort=time
[0:36:55] Skylert: fun fact Your lips only touch for 4 letters of the alphabet, until we meet again
[0:37:00] Alonelyhawk: I still havent airborneAww
[0:37:02] Cujo71_: 60 days is a really long time. COuld make people on the cusp not clock in until the end of the 60 days
[0:37:06] FowlBirdman: KEKW
[0:37:07] CopperKat: I still think an even simpler solution would just be for DAPs to fall off based on X amount of hours on duty. They already track hours clocked in - it could be entirely automatic. IRL days only encourages staying off duty. @uhsnow
[0:37:13] SeaOfEmpty: A "day" should be 4 hours on shift
[0:37:14] twisty_mc: dont need to look at SoPs when you written them before KEKW
[0:37:21] Flugger1: Is it a rule you can't show SOP's?

[0:37:49] StreamElements: There are bots currently going around Twitch whispering you about giveaways. These giveaways are a scam. DO NOT CLICK ANYTHING, just report them to Twitch and block them!
[0:37:52] Senna_Minxy: 1 dap per bullet
[0:37:55] NGVtv: That would be kinda poggers
[0:38:02] twisty_mc: be worth it for 1 dap imo wikked
[0:38:10] Dtakul: Hi Snow, How's going ?
[0:38:13] miketwng: depends on which Capt you get dapped according to the flavour
[0:38:20] MrSpiny: kivaNotes
[0:38:21] quimmers: Chatting it was less lethal, he was already dead
[0:38:24] Senna_Minxy: Would it count as a trick shot? wikked
[0:38:52] MDM4ever1986HD: moonmoon said it right snow https://www.twitch.tv/moonmoon/clip/TangentialResourcefulLattePogChamp-rYr71Gdh2HQPpQRL?filter=clips&range=7d&sort=time
[0:39:00] Sieber13: A shift should represent a day. 8 hours = 1 day. If that was the case, guys like Den and Cornwood would likely have been fine.
[0:39:01] CopperKat: What do you think about DAPs falling off based on X amount of hours on duty? Encourages being on duty and corrects the issue of people who do long shifts being at higher risk for suspension even if they make equal mistakes to someone else who spreads out their shifts over 30-60 IRL days
[0:39:05] BurningFlag: @Senna_Minxy that is the right question NODDERS
[0:39:23] Kaiyo_exe: Should excessive force post fatality count as lethal or less lethal because they're already dead
[0:39:42] StephyFace: lmfao
[0:39:48] Firasputinv: It is such a silly change OMEGALAUGHING
[0:39:51] BfAleTitan: like Vinny the other talking about "can't wait to shoot an officer and go to jail for an hour"
[0:39:53] quimmers: the biggest most influential troll KEKW
[0:40:02] MDM4ever1986HD: KEKW
[0:40:07] Senna_Minxy: He's the new jesus wikked
[0:40:08] BaldHermit: Dap drop-off should be based on in-game hours onshift, the same way criminals time in prison is related to in-game time too. The maximum daps per situation should be 3 - with anything massively 'bad' being escalated to 'the state'
[0:40:08] Kangaro0: everyone’s reaction to when you say minutes is so funny
[0:40:08] CopperKat: KEKL
[0:40:12] DrDandelion: what if instead of days, they did on duty time. what stops people from waiting it out on another character?
[0:40:13] lukievondukie: silly change in a silly world
[0:40:30] CarolineSwitched: Old Dab
[0:40:45] ArenaKrusher: just as long as you use the ISO system NODDERS

[0:42:51] dukegummybear: daps were good as a start but I like that they're thinking more deeply about it
[0:43:45] FetchLong: I think it should be moved from DAPs to immedeate punishment like foot patrols, paperwork, cleaning , doing laundry, etc. Severe wrongdoings = suspension or fired

[0:44:35] Xierany: That is the best option though, seeing as you can get stupid unfair DAPs like Shiesty did and get fired
[0:44:43] BfAleTitan: unfortunately there are people that are worried about getting on duty and getting dap'd for "doing their job"
[0:44:53] Sqwidlet: You would never burn someone in a prison

[0:45:01] SeaOfEmpty: Well if they do have feelings I would hope others would care and not be dismissive
[0:45:03] Senna_Minxy: @uhSnow Similar thing would happen with criminals who got multiple days in Jail no? I understand jail is smaller ofc but they'd just not play that character
[0:45:05] bbotaa: circumvent the system, makes the system useless
[0:45:07] Christian2920: It was a riot Sqwidlet Kappa
[0:45:07] Circassa: exactly. in the end its still RP so a RP "punishment" should be given, not suspension right away

[0:45:18] MDM4ever1986HD: I mean Dean didn't want to play as Denzel because he didn't want ruffle more feathers
[0:45:34] Silverheart59: DAP = Doing Actual Policework points
[0:45:39] Sqwidlet: @Christian2920 my bad Kappa
[0:46:03] Circassa: @Silverheart59 so you're saying only a handful of cops will get DAPs? LUL
[0:46:10] batperson: DAPs should fall off based on active hours logged
[0:46:20] dukegummybear: i miss boat patrol
[0:46:24] CopperKat: Cornwood had 0.0039% DAPs per hour, he actually didn't fuck up often at all. But because it's based on 60 IRL days he hits suspension thresholds sooner than someone who might be making more mistakes but just spread out their hours more.
[0:46:27] Prollos: vault patrol to protect G6 KEKW
[0:46:28] Silverheart59: @Circassa I didn't say that but I'm also not saying that~
[0:46:28] robertsmithjr: i feel like it really shouldnt be that hard to just not do the things that get you big daps, that way that occasional 1 dap here or there isnt an issue, daps would most likely start falling of before getting close to 10

[0:47:12] DrDandelion: peepoBrick
[0:47:18] Silverheart59: @ManakinEU All 3.0 people were clamoring for PD accountability.
[0:47:20] dukegummybear: i dont like the 10 equals firing because context of the 10 should matter.

[0:47:26] batperson: @MDM4ever1986HD otherwise you're incentivized to play as little as possible during those 60 days

[0:47:44] ManakinEU: @Silverheart59 there should be but you could be more creative with it
[0:47:57] lovelee___: one of my favorite punishments from 3.0 was when Byson had to stand at the CG cubby with a stop sign and they kidnapped him for a meth run
[0:48:01] Silverheart59: @ManakinEU To be fair, I've seen punishments like picking up trash for 30 minutes.
[0:48:10] Lady__ETTV: we have a cam!!
[0:48:11] CopperKat: If the response to hours on duty as a metric is 'Don't get DAP'd' then the system has failed as a way to help people learn from mistakes. Everyone should be expected to get DAPs because no one is perfect.
[0:48:18] MDM4ever1986HD: @batperson I mean it's little OTT
[0:48:28] Senna_Minxy: Are the Torus the new Chargers this wipe?

[0:48:48] Silverheart59: The PD has a pendulum problem. 3.0 there was no accountability. In 4.0 they're holding cops so accountable they're afraid to do their job.

[1:51:33] Hibob222: allow
[1:51:33] Circassa: nah, just a RP punishment would've been fine. i respect the decision taken but its harsh for sure
[1:51:33] Xierany: It's weird saying 24 bullets is okay, but the extra 1 is excessive enough to give 5 DAPs
