[0:24:12] xnightshift2658: Hate the character not the streamer
[0:24:12] buddha_hands: she's fantastic
[0:24:14] dakota22446: wideduckass
[0:24:15] BKBiggy: I mean goes with how the RP has been it went fast. things litteraly goes with how the RP has been and I've been loving it. honestly the hate in RP ok but ooc doesn't belong
[0:24:15] Alekdk1: Are people actually sending hate to Cheever herself?
[0:24:16] robertsmithjr: agreed cheever is amazing
[0:24:18] ImOome: yueah cheever is a boss for all of those rp ttbh
[0:24:18] cozyjozey: rp'd too good
[0:24:20] mad0monk: I think she should go villain arc and start her own militia and start doing wild shit
[0:24:23] DiscretionaI: True. No one did wrong technically. Just HOW situations were tackled based by culture vs culture
[0:24:24] LamePuf: the RP hoppers are insane, they are playing characters :|
[0:24:30] robertsmithjr: like you said she does a lot of the paperwork stuff
[0:24:31] TogetherAlone: Some people have a hard time separating the character from the player.
[0:24:34] walkgleesh: people dislike the character, not the streamer
[0:24:35] Dee__1__: PD would've been boring without her
[0:24:37] Artsii1994: Its just stupid of people to hate in a charecter they dint know a side of
[0:24:38] milkbagzz: I loved River cheever back in 3.0

[0:24:49] BKBiggy: Organic RP always ends up as the best
[0:24:49] sharkjax: Esfand constantly says how good she is, especially with the behind the scenes discord stuff.  People have to learn to seperate characters from the people playing them.
[0:24:51] DanLGG: I really wanted to see Cheever on blaus podcast so viewers could get know her cause she’s great. rather than hating her for something she’s doing a great job at
[0:24:52] ImOome: arguably Cheever has had one of the best characters in RP to stir everything
[0:24:56] KimgamingFB: Ssaab she only cought the wrong guy, if it wasent X or MR K it wouldent have been like this att all
[0:25:02] roundishh: There should be two police departments, one for the serious rp and one for the more outrageous rp
[0:25:03] SG8970: I feel like I've seen you get your fair share of those people. It's been ridiculous

[0:55:44] dragonskeld: 0 daps just means you dont take chances EZ
[0:55:47] sonadapop: @jesusgvg it’s not always about “more cops” being like that. it’s about how you relay that information
[0:55:48] fellathedude: <3
[0:55:52] GustavoK___: @MintJoint he got a dap offline ReallyMad
[0:55:53] SpilledNuts: I'm sure this has been said but I think the majority of "DAPs" really are just training moments, and a lot of people felt liek it was punitive instead. When in reality, people just need some correction and direction, and then encouragement.
[0:55:54] robertsmithjr: i know im being a smart ass @Ssaab

[0:56:05] Paniagua64: that was a great conversation you had with her keep up the good work
[0:56:08] BadRabbits: I been thinking that the only issue with daps is the threat of being fired. If being fired was last case, after retraining, demotion, punishment details etc then daps wouldn't strees officers out, just be a learning tool.

[0:57:30] dakota22446: I disagree, I think daps weren’t hard enough Tomfoolery
[0:57:32] darkblad3s: @Ssaab do you like star wars?

[1:47:47] riftshadow: Welcome to having authority
[1:47:47] thewarth0g: needs reassurance
[1:47:47] buddha_hands: there IS a ton of politics already OMEGALAUGHING but there shouldn't be
[1:47:49] Eddie1225: bones just wants to wear his corcs sad
[1:47:52] Zyphamon: @ryancotter78 yes
[1:47:53] Bill_Collector: I mean slacks is proof you barely ever have to say the right thing to get promoted
[1:47:53] VonBonvo: @thewarth0g  true
[1:48:08] KaIista_: And also the crocs
[1:48:29] limerick2018: Bones is on his Duncan arc
[1:48:42] ryancotter78: @zyphamon what his twitch name
[1:48:46] Bill_Collector: That's true Duncan might need to mentor this guy
[1:48:49] taraannee: snrs also recommended him, maybe he'd feel more confident to know they wanted him as the same rank too
[1:48:56] layla109: @limerick2018 To be fair we all have our duncaning arc XD
[1:48:56] TheShaunDon: bones needs to train his talk no jutsu indeed

[1:49:49] taraannee: WOAH WHAT? what did i miss w tips wtf
[1:49:54] Thebreadlord: Every time Bones shows up to a chase, Alice In Chains should play
[1:49:57] DaZooKidd420: It's definitely political,  anytime there's rank and power involved there's always going to be people who want that power and will do whatever and screw over whoever they have to to get there. Not everyone but always a few people
[1:50:03] riftshadow: What telling a prisoner you are going to beat the DNA out of him is bad??

[1:50:36] VonBonvo: He's out of his element which is regular patrol. But the fact that he was here having this convo shows he has a mind for "politics" he's just worried he's not doing it right
[1:50:43] Jackieboicuz: should do a audit on the amount of food he takes
[1:50:44] ryancotter78: I did try to find it
[1:50:54] Zyphamon: @taraannee he played too much with a 95. he sent them, then realized he should have taken DNA and took actions
[1:50:56] Bill_Collector: The politics is a result of the captains slow rolling promotions. It's created a bucket of crabs with everyone being senior right now
[1:50:56] Stenicus: Great RP
[1:51:02] Moobot: Thanks for subbing, bjchan54! Welcome to the Saabscribers! saabH

[1:51:49] KaIista_: Also it's Bones' self discovery in a way*
[1:51:52] StreamElements: Please do not meta in chat, which means do not tell Saab stuff happening in RP that his character would otherwise not know.
[1:51:54] M3disyn: WTFF

[2:10:48] magnets_: @moodymellow yeah this was 100% an example of that. he coulda got out of it with an apology and a couple daps max
[2:10:50] qHaydos: how could it only be 2 daps for going to prison, beating him down and grabbing his dna on ground then paying him off

[2:12:17] wavep987: @TheProducerShadowZz Johnson got fired for his terrible attitude and lying on his report. Tipps didn't lie on his report and accepted the talking to.

[2:12:51] layla109: Oh danm
[2:12:51] taraannee: i feel like for someone else that could get them fired like thats one of the worst situations ive heard so far
[2:12:57] TheProducerShadowZz: @wavep987 both officers didn't mention this incident in the report, nor the 4k payment, so yes, they lied, about corruption
[2:12:58] Marthentic: oh shit he gone o7
[2:12:59] Rare__Potato: Maybe he should've have done dumb shit then OMEGALAUGHING
[2:13:00] buttersfrfr: rip then my brother o7
[2:13:04] qHaydos: u shouldnt base daps on how many he already has??
[2:13:06] moodymellow: I thought they do roll off now?
[2:13:10] riftshadow: Its ok Frost gave him the Long stick of the Law.
[2:13:13] cadbeaver: i like how viewers complained about giving too much daps and now are complaining there is not enough daps lol.
[2:13:14] Zyphamon: exactly, do dumb shit get dumb prizes

[2:13:25] FLORIDaPKER: introduce decimal system of .5 MiniK
[2:13:28] wavep987: @TheProducerShadowZz My man shouted at the captain and berated other captains.
[2:13:32] Eddie1225: its cuz its not there streamer OMEGALAUGHING
[2:13:36] skimomoula7: Shouldn't worry about previous daps for a New one
[2:13:41] htran__: @Eddie1225 mhm
[2:13:41] WHATtheINTERROBANG: thats bribery i agree with bones
[2:13:45] Bosweny: why would you save him? you didnt save den or corn
[2:13:52] Buffalohed: nobody saved johnson
[2:13:54] TheProducerShadowZz: @wavep987 Shouting at captain > bribery anbd corruption, good one
[2:14:00] HogballTV: you guys didn’t save cornwood give him what he deserves
[2:14:00] moodymellow: If an officer is bribing then they should be fired, not going to lie. I feel like a bigger investigation should happen.
[2:14:00] RobialT: Ask a bunch of lawyers to pursue charges also
[2:14:02] qHaydos: thats unbelievable that hes not getting 3 daps at least just for bribery
[2:14:06] Kunarklive: anything past 3 daps should just be automatic training session or take the 5 daps
[2:14:10] SG8970: BABBLING did you hear
[2:14:11] oldwrldblues: @Buffalohed johnson lied
[2:14:11] Chaoszero_goc: den zel should get dapped out of this, there has to be a way
[2:14:14] Rare__Potato: Fire the whole PD ReallyMad
[2:14:19] taraannee: im so confused as to how this isnt being viewed as more serious by them
[2:14:20] suzibaguzi: it’s unfortunate that the captains want to dap for everything instead of allowing a mistake and learn from it
[2:14:22] qHaydos: bribery would lead to firing normally, thats unbelievable hes getting 1 dap for it
[2:14:24] Joebowlr21: Can i take your Dna? No. "Wack!" can i now take your dna? thank you for being complient EZ
[2:14:25] el_cappo22: 3 daps

[2:14:42] htran__: FirstTimeChatter
[2:14:45] Lupusdeus: Can we somehow implicate Cornwood in this @ssaab , there has to be a way right? Kappa
[2:14:45] wavep987: @TheProducerShadowZz Tipps didn't bribe, he thought it was a verbal settlement. The guy literally said "settlement".
[2:14:50] refi3xy___: @qhaydos  tru
[2:14:57] Joebowlr21: chill out chat we just being "goofy" EZ
[2:15:00] aye_see: its the same as the den zel situation, can't take the current number of daps into the punishment.
[2:15:01] Virtux_: @oldwrldblues He didn't lie, he just didn't tell the story detailed enough
[2:15:03] TCGK_SUBZERO: @suzibaguzi what do you think the point of daps are?
[2:15:08] Marthentic: KEKW
[2:15:17] layla109: @qHaydos I agree. That's what corrupt officers would look like to many. I personally would've given 3 daps for that. IRL you would be fired. Lol
[2:15:18] SG8970: whole department smoking now. Everyone's losing it Sadge
[2:15:21] keslindl: with the medical report could that be excessive force?
[2:15:27] RobialT: @Virtux_ Almost like the exact same thing that happened here
[2:15:31] taraannee: i cant believe for once im the one wanting a harsher punishment LUL
[2:15:34] Chaoszero_goc: I liked the classes idea for retraining
[2:15:35] Rare__Potato: oop that's a bit of an issue
[2:15:39] Yerps2g: ill be honest sounds like the PD needs to train officers better
[2:15:41] magnets_: yeah frost needs some polishing for sure
[2:15:45] Marthentic: they should have Ocean Dumped him EZ Clap
[2:15:48] htran__: oh shit catServing30YearsInPrisionForFirstDegreeArson
[2:15:49] riftshadow: If they needed the DNA could they just not get a warrant and go get it legaly.
[2:15:56] DanLGG: no one has time for classes
[2:16:01] DaltonIRL: Bones PainChamp
[2:16:02] TheTourist_: catServing30YearsInPrisionForFirstDegreeArson
[2:16:04] el_cappo22: 3dapss
[2:16:08] KaIista_: 2 is good too I think
[2:16:10] qHaydos: 2 daps is absolutely rubbish
[2:16:10] jd2881: Could she just have assumed Tips got the ok to do it.
[2:16:11] Virtux_: @RobialT idk, i just got here
[2:16:22] Eddie1225: OMEGALAUGHING
[2:16:23] DanLGG: Who was against it?

[2:16:27] magnets_: BONES LMFAO
[2:16:29] riftshadow: Honestly they should have just Oceaned the guy and not given him the 4k
[2:16:31] downtowncrownn: OMEGALAUGHING
[2:16:32] DaltonIRL: Bones has 0 self awareness LOL
[2:16:32] magnets_: he's coming for ruby KEKW

[2:16:39] SG8970: BABBLING
[2:16:40] HustlerOneX: let it all out
[2:16:42] layla109: LUL
[2:16:43] TheProducerShadowZz: @wavep987 You're not getting it. You're using meta knowledge, slacks doesn't know this, from slacks pov there is a victim saying he had 4k forced on him, frost saying she doesnt remember, and tips who didnt mention this to anyone, and now has a story that he never mentioned to a senior
[2:16:46] DanLGG: It’s a good argument. Iron out these issues now.
[2:16:48] Immortallisk: KEKW
[2:16:51] TheTourist_: LETHIMCOOK
[2:16:52] Ikilledkenny91: You opened this wound slacks @ssaab
[2:16:54] hvanity: Beat down and bribery - give em all the daps
[2:16:57] Zyphamon: he should bring this up. It's absolutely nutless rn
[2:16:59] neonsloths: let em go
[2:17:05] htran__: let em dialouge it out
[2:17:07] moodymellow: Lack of knowledge shouldn't be a dap, it should be re-training and demotion, then after re-training if this happens again then a dap should be in place.
[2:17:11] Haw2424: I’m liking this better… seems more fair..
[2:17:11] SG8970: Rain down Dap-fire Evilowo
[2:17:13] ItsMavray: let the kids fight  LUL
[2:17:15] Bosweny: why are you trying to give someone less daps to save them when you haven't before?
[2:17:15] jollypnda: @ssaab this is a classic case of good initiative but bad judgement
[2:17:17] wavep987: @TheProducerShadowZz Slacks was just told that there was no corruption involved.
[2:17:17] layla109: Come on Bones. COOK!
[2:17:17] KaIista_: Yeah it's good for the seniors to discuss this
[2:17:18] Chaoszero_goc: bones and ruby dont get along for real? has to be a misunderstanding idk
[2:17:18] neonsloths: they need to learn how to find their way to resolution without you there, but you overseeing is good
[2:17:25] FSouza_01: LETHIMCOOK
[2:17:26] taraannee: im shocked bones is the senior taking this the most seriously, am i smoking crack bro LUL
[2:17:32] htran__: mhm
[2:17:37] DaltonIRL: Ruby gonna be Bone's boss soon
[2:17:40] DaltonIRL: KEKW
[2:17:41] qHaydos: he should be thankful hes not getting fired??
[2:17:46] magnets_: yeah tips will take it on the chin
[2:17:50] Lupusdeus: McNulty could not give a fuck, he just wants to get out on patrol LUL
[2:17:58] TheProducerShadowZz: @wavep987 Yes, based on those 3 testimonies, none support one another, slacks read the testimonies yesterday with turner, there is no new information
[2:18:14] taraannee: so youre giving him 2 instead of 3 daps just so he doesnt get fired?...
[2:18:15] FSouza_01: Bone stepped up a lot, he sounds locked in
[2:18:15] layla109: Training definitely seems like an issue in the PD if stuff like this is happening.
[2:18:20] FSouza_01: Bones*
[2:18:30] Lupusdeus: "He's just a goofy guy" LUL
[2:18:36] el_cappo22: lol
[2:18:37] wavep987: @TheProducerShadowZz If Slacks thought it was corruption, he would have been fired already. Corruption is a fireable offense.
[2:18:39] KaIista_: @taraannee 3 wouldn't mean fired, just suspended
[2:18:41] robertsmithjr: whps he talking about
[2:18:47] Bugszy: who we talking about
[2:18:49] robertsmithjr: whos
[2:19:00] RobialT: @KaIista_ Pretty sure PPOs get fired with 5
[2:19:02] neonsloths: tiggz or tibbz something like that
[2:19:03] downtowncrownn: chat the difference is tips was honest
[2:19:04] TheTourist_: "just a goofy guy" has saved me from a lot of chat timeouts, it's a valid strategy mhm
[2:19:10] layla109: @Lupusdeus Out of all three Mcnulty is my favorite senior but for commissioner, I think it's gotta be Ruby if not one of the captains.
[2:19:11] KaIista_: @RobialT Oh shit, was unaware
[2:19:14] Bugszy: @neonsloths cheers
[2:19:16] TheProducerShadowZz: @wavep987 That's my point though, feels like everyone is intentionally ignoring it jsut to not fire his character
[2:19:18] HolyMalice: Is this about that bribe situation and the dna?
[2:19:24] robertsmithjr: ahh ok ty
[2:19:26] taraannee: ok that was just the way it came across since slacks went from 3 to 2 so i didnt know why
[2:19:42] DaltonIRL: now people want more DAPS as if the PD isn't allowed to adjust based on recent events lol
[2:19:43] daru_89: Having them debate it is a great learning experience for them
[2:19:46] Lupusdeus: @layla109 100% agree, can already hear McNulty saying "Fock dat paperwork shite"
[2:19:46] DanLGG: He’s a PPO so he is 1 unlucky pit away from terms?

[3:44:36] PsychoJoker: @DanLGG he was innocent but he made the guy feel like he had to plead guilty and called it no contest
[3:44:37] Bill_Collector: Maple didn't explain it that since he wanted no contest it should be not guilty, it's just kinda bad faith
[3:44:39] gmdwyer: are you ever going to meet with Cornwood?
[3:44:45] AfroAltruism: @Latertoyl It'd be a good test no? but you have a point
[3:44:51] ChiefZBP: @Tarushaffxiv Means your not fighting the charge but your not pleading guilty either

[3:45:26] DaZooKidd420: Cornwood took care of it 3days ago other than the fact he did 300+ months
[3:45:34] taraannee: i’m still so confused bc where it was left it seemed he hadn’t been reimbursed & there was no indication in report of talking to a judge right??
[3:45:48] Bill_Collector: The fact that cornwood had to handle it isn't a good look probably
[3:45:50] RonJon: omegalul1

[3:48:36] aspectofdaze: pepeW
[3:48:38] Latertoyl: the difference for no contest is the admittance of guilt, no contest means you are accepting the punishment without admitting any guilt

[4:09:49] ADK_MtnGamer: they gotta do something to make it harder to resist arrest… it’s crazy how easy it is to
[4:09:49] netokun666: NotLikeThis
[4:09:50] EndyEnderson: Demon time
[4:09:52] postAmongUsist: monkaTOS
[4:09:53] PandaNomsBamboo: body count
[4:10:11] jollypnda: I mean it’s meta to tell you why there are so many dead people there
[4:10:16] Pee_aRe: who the fuck stacking all them bodies
[4:10:17] taraannee: imo should be a limit of times
[4:10:18] layla109: cuffs are too easy to break
[4:10:23] Skycoh: after a 2 minute foot chase, taser should be authorized.
[4:10:24] Tueur562: its so slow, if they miss they deserve to get caught lol
[4:10:28] Drexb: I feel like third cuff should be 100%
[4:10:29] nekodon1: i gota know why all the bodys
[4:10:31] layla109: Don't get kidnapped
[4:10:31] wriggless: its easier now since you only have to press e not a number 1-4
[4:10:31] joel_alex: Remember catching them can end their entire career in RP.
[4:10:33] TCGK_SUBZERO: hope the devs fix the taser issues soon, bit too buggy
[4:10:34] nekodon1: whos colleting them
[4:10:37] prabs__: that was almost 3-4 blocks of run
[4:10:38] HuhWei: maybe just gets harder each time
[4:10:42] jakebird_: I wish it was a skill check on both sides... like who can type the 5 letters the fastest
[4:10:45] TheGradius: What's the drink of choice tonight?
[4:10:53] sinisterschwag: i honestly feel like the simple solution would be that if they break cuffs harsher fines. but i know nothing
[4:10:56] Kid_Vicarious: that was a big worde for bones
[4:10:59] WildWillie419: Or maybe the cop could have a counter mini-game?
[4:11:00] shotzsausagefingers: considering theres litrually no other way then a cop uncuffing it being a bit easy is an upside
[4:11:08] SPxTDG: Waiting
[4:11:11] Darothane: @sinisterschwag it should be resisting
[4:11:34] joel_alex: I think the breaking cuffs is fine for this early RP. No one wants a city of felons incapable of working and driving.
[4:11:45] Drexb: Watch the turbo be stolen
[4:11:47] DanLGG: ^
[4:11:47] StreamElements: What they said saabThat
[4:11:56] DonnieRockettt: PD can't shoot tires??
[4:12:04] Bill_Collector: High speed pit them pls
[4:12:05] Rare__Potato: monkaSpeed
[4:12:09] Stenicus: that car be fast tho
[4:12:12] sinisterschwag: @Darothane but dont those usually get dropped. i dont get to watch as much as i like
[4:12:12] DanLGG: Can’t steal turbos outside garages anymore I don’t believe
[4:12:19] PSturtle: It would be interesting if the cuff timing gets harder for each successful try. Or it get harder if you are low on stamina or some shit
[4:12:20] joel_alex: Also the cost for getting caught is not small depending, so I think giving them more chances improves RP on all ends.
[4:12:27] DonnieRockettt: Slacks and the Furious
[4:12:36] reagadin: who is the best driver in the current PD?
[4:12:39] DonnieRockettt: traumzSteer
[4:12:43] ShinJiHun: yoink
[4:12:45] Rare__Potato: classic not prepared for a chase, +1 DAP for Slacks
[4:12:55] raahnur: @WildWillie419 They talked about that in blau's podcast, desync would be an issue
[4:13:25] Bill_Collector: +1 parallel
[4:13:30] ScullzyTrolly: @DonnieRockettt Instant job loss if they miss and hit them
[4:13:38] greenburg22: GOOD GUESS
[4:13:41] Rare__Potato: SHEESH who is this guy
[4:13:42] Stenicus: This is my cop
[4:13:48] Skycoh: god damn, GREAT driving.
[4:13:49] jetstargirls: afternoon captain
[4:13:53] postAmongUsist: DESKCHAN the gates
[4:13:55] ShinJiHun: o7
[4:13:57] Artsii1994: This guy is flying
[4:13:59] Rare__Potato: o7 lots to a fence
[4:14:13] joel_alex: Ramee’s lawyer arc for instance was great RP for all parties. One felony ends that RP and forces them down a criminal RP. Less contact with multiple people outside their click.
[4:14:14] BlazingVollk: blind LUL
[4:14:17] Stenicus: fuck...
[4:14:24] jetstargirls: I want to apologize for how I acted during your last stream and will now behave myself from now on
[4:14:25] riftshadow: PD needs to hand out more tickets to get a helicopter.
[4:14:30] DonnieRockettt: @ScullzyTrolly thought since they were close up, but understood
[4:14:31] layla109: Faulty PD gear is a big issue.
[4:14:31] NSAne93: so can flip a car over, and use a gat eto get away. feel like thats bad RP

[4:15:13] PSturtle: What did they do?
[4:15:14] reagadin: 150ish i think @stoynk

[4:15:37] Flailuid: Every time cg gets away with there gun a civ dies lol
[4:15:37] jollypnda: ain’t no way people asking for air 1 against a car that goes 100 mph
[4:16:01] Stenicus: @Ssaab when is the PD getting Air one?
[4:16:15] TCGK_SUBZERO: just got bike cops, air 1 still probably long time out
[4:16:18] crazyfr0gtv: next PD JETS CALLING IT KEKW
[4:16:26] sealingfann: chat actually wants air one for this?
[4:16:32] adshotta: Pd never used air 1 for 80s
[4:16:35] Bill_Collector: PD hellfires when
[4:16:35] layla109: Yes
[4:16:43] ScullzyTrolly: @Flailuid Honestly I think every time a bad DOJ court ruling happens a LOT of people die lol
[4:16:44] pepedoot: AC130
[4:16:47] xJusahog_: these cars are basically jets already
[4:16:52] Krimson07_: air1 for this?
[4:16:54] Krimson07_: weird
[4:16:57] morgado_4: they used 2 cars one goes 80mph and the lampadati is 100 mph
[4:17:00] joel_alex: Air None.
[4:17:11] pepedoot: those crim cars go 100mph they just turn and brake so good
[4:17:13] Stenicus: right they use b-52 bombers for 80d
[4:17:28] crazyfr0gtv: sounds generic
[4:17:36] ScullzyTrolly: @pepedoot its the limpdaddy, best car to lockpick right now
[4:17:37] interp_tv: 10 ppl at pd lol XD
[4:17:40] PSturtle: Damn send them to WORK!
[4:17:41] onlycrazyone: they dont need air 1 they have 6  cars on 1 car
[4:17:47] limerick2018: Not trying to be weird or anything but has woman ever led pd in no pixel history

[4:17:58] TCGK_SUBZERO: right
[4:17:58] layla109: LUL
[4:18:02] jollypnda: using air 1 for cars that a cvpi can keep up with is a quick way to have crims start ambushing cops
[4:18:03] Pee_aRe: there was no one on there
[4:18:03] ScullzyTrolly: @onlycrazyone and they had a free flip too
[4:18:04] mixersuxs: Yo who that cutie patootee on the top left? swizzmBINO swizzmBINO

[7:31:34] Istaf_SC: moon2SPY ban all these moon subs. They're being cringe
[7:31:41] infintitedream: Nah that self incrimination if he does. i
[7:31:43] dioni: emote only?
[7:31:44] dollar_25: peepoAds peepoRiot
[7:31:47] Eddie1225: @Istaf_SC true
[7:31:53] DanLGG: You could admin approve a vod review In court that way everyone can watch it LUL
[7:31:54] Rare__Potato: ABOBA
[7:31:54] ExoticMeats: @danlgg they forget it's actual people behind the character
[7:31:55] DeeterDo: right !  the streamers are making such great content is insane
[7:32:19] CuBanMumzy: you guys talking after is under question? isn't that personal conversation?
[7:32:38] DanLGG: I’ve watched the clip several times and I don’t know the exact verbiage
[7:32:40] buddha_hands: I remember that moons acting was amazing during it more than I remember what he actually said OMEGALAUGHING
[7:32:51] DanLGG: ^
[7:32:51] StreamElements: What they said saabThat
[7:33:16] Pee_aRe: I wonder if Slacks remembers the talk that Miss Captain R said while yall was walking up into the office
[7:33:20] ExoticMeats: Just refer to the script, 4 head
[7:33:23] ClipsBott: {Use ' !clip  [title] ' command to create a clip that is automatically sent to the #twitchclips channel on Discord ClappyHype }
[7:33:28] bahubaker: @DanLGG same, i remember him responding to them but i dont remember what was said it was a week ago and i dont remember what i had for lunch yesterday
[7:33:53] rclemon_: OOC how are you going to sleep at night knowing that you let Ruth walk away from treason. I would never have a good nights sleep if  i was you
[7:33:56] JesusGVG: there isnt LULW
[7:34:01] Moobot: Thank you for subbing, Ficktions! Welcome to the Saabscribers! saabH
[7:34:02] elkeffe: no
[7:34:02] buddha_hands: not even remotely close lmao
[7:34:05] gadget_t: No :)
[7:34:07] Blanketslol: no
[7:34:08] ITZxJeff: has she said something like that before in like captains only meetings?
[7:34:09] urkuri92: there's none lol
[7:34:10] layla109: There isn't
[7:34:11] buddha_hands: it's like a chess play
[7:34:11] Alexqc19: Nah its all malicious OMEGALUL
[7:34:16] duranggo: what does the charge say...
[7:34:23] ExoticMeats: The amount of stuff characters go through daily you have to try and remember everything
[7:34:23] Rare__Potato: @Eddie1225 gotta get Saab to get the same shit Moon's mods have so y'all can put shit up on stream OMEGALAUGHING
[7:34:24] ComradeGreetingCard: the charges don't convey intent
[7:34:25] Ficktions: I believe it could be found as treason with the way she phrased it
[7:34:26] monkz89: @rclemon_ they really need to dissolve the LSPD for this, this simply cannot stand
[7:34:27] TryAtomic: @buddha_hands It was really good
[7:34:30] Moobot: Thanks for subbing, whaleownage! Welcome to the Saabscribers! saabH
[7:34:31] throat_pump: the treason would have been what she said later, but if slacks the character doesn’t remember, then he doesn’t remember
[7:34:31] bahubaker: its not, there is other meta going on about it tho
[7:34:33] mad0monk: Stop covering for anyone Slacks, the other captains aren't as involved or as good as you at all of this, just give the story best you know and let the other captains fall on their own swords
[7:34:37] Eddie1225: @Rare__Potato yea in 10 years
[7:35:10] buddha_hands: DAYUM
[7:35:17] Rare__Potato: Chatters trying to talk to a character in a video game classic
[7:35:29] DaymanF0TNM: is that really even up for debate, I feel like it's no where near treason
[7:35:47] Tsilin: If there were any further actions to further the statement they might have something, but I doubt that.
[7:35:48] buddha_hands: if this did actually hit court, it'd be interesting for the note that he refused to work with them to be said publicly LuL
[7:35:53] mad0monk: @Rare__Potato yeah cause we watch and enjoy the RP so we like to chat about it, get off your high horse
[7:35:55] focustft: chatting
[7:35:59] Blanketslol: it's too bad moon isn't going to play another term, max has been so good over what he did as dab, there's so much more he can do in another term
[7:36:00] ArdentCause: LOL top left
[7:36:06] CuBanMumzy: why is he embellishing  that they were talking after while they were leaving? Isn't it in question what she said in the meeting? Am i missing something.
[7:36:11] DanLGG: If he doesn’t remember he doesn’t remember. It’s kinda like iron man dying In the last avengers movie. We can’t change it we can just watch
[7:36:16] Istaf_SC: hmmm
[7:36:23] ArdentCause: hmmmmmmmm
[7:36:42] ITZxJeff: hmmmmm
[7:36:47] rclemon_: I know what happened
[7:36:49] Eddie1225: even then
[7:36:52] Eddie1225: it doesn't matter
[7:36:55] mad0monk: https://www.twitch.tv/ssaab/clip/AssiduousCulturedCarabeefRickroll-X62TKzefNJJflS_K?filter=clips&range=7d&sort=time
[7:36:55] rclemon_: Slacks wanted to assassinate the mayor
[7:36:57] ITZxJeff: anyone else drunk while watching this?
[7:36:59] mad0monk: Halls clip
[7:36:59] Eddie1225: max has zero to do with that OMEGALAUGHING
[7:37:01] Ficktions: I could paraphrase what was said in the halls, but I don't want to meta, so I'll keep to myself :)
[7:37:03] JesusGVG: mfs got the clip ready OMEGALAUGHING
[7:37:03] ArdentCause: does it count as metagaming for your character if you go back and watch your own vod ?
[7:37:08] Istaf_SC: I know moon2SPY
[7:37:11] Zhang_1888: yea that was just banter in the halls
[7:37:12] DeeterDo: They just want to make sure the report wasnt changed from the public one, that's his golden ticket
[7:37:13] dommeka: I know what happened
[7:37:15] mad0monk: Yeah but you are the sensible one out of it all is all im saying
[7:37:15] Rare__Potato: Bet most Chatters couldn't even tell you what the Treason charge reads OMEGALAUGHING
[7:37:16] urkuri92: LMAOOOO
[7:37:18] khrow: slacks said he would kill max NODDERS
[7:37:18] fellathedude: you did ask for it!
[7:37:24] buddha_hands: @CuBanMumzy yeah whatever they said during the walk, dab wouldn't have heard anyway right lol
[7:37:26] Istaf_SC: moon2Y fire her yo
[7:37:30] monkz89: "why don't you RP the way I want you to RP"
[7:37:30] Gygosan: please go against R uth for us please
[7:37:34] Ned15: Why is that important
[7:37:37] Istaf_SC: @monkz89 TRUUUUUU
[7:37:46] CuBanMumzy: oh the chatters  are talking about something that only luth tuner and slacks heard. OMG.
[7:37:50] GreenMonk: too be fair, you said show the receipts of the treason and then ignored it when the clip came
[7:37:54] Moobot: Thank you for subbing, duranggo! Welcome to the Saabscribers! saabH
[7:37:55] Ficktions: Does Slacks see why they're asking about who made it private?
[7:37:55] Gygosan: handing over meta WCop
[7:38:05] CuBanMumzy: @buddha_hands exactly!  reminds me of the brick incident.
[7:38:16] mad0monk: I think the clip shows the other captains saying we aren't gonna do that and Slacks saying that's treason and we have to
[7:38:37] rclemon_: So many monks Hmmm
[7:38:38] JesusGVG: he is still talking about the clip ICANT
[7:38:38] mad0monk: I'm saying you didn't agree with them
[7:38:40] Ned15: Why is Cornwood putting it that way LUL
[7:38:43] DeeterDo: @Ficktions maybe but they are making sure he wasn't the one who 'edited' it
[7:38:44] FizzDidThis: Saususge monks
[7:38:48] rclemon_: sus
[7:38:56] scaredsquid: sgtaMunch
[7:38:57] layla109: @mad0monk He wasn't talking to you lol
[7:38:57] rclemon_: Wheres the monastery sus
[7:38:58] monkz89: I am the real monk
[7:39:05] buddha_hands: people were talking about it but I don't remember the announcement being significant anyway OMEGALAUGHING
[7:39:12] Ficktions: @DeeterDo Exactly, because they're trying to help him not be an accomplice
[7:39:14] mad0monk: damn
[7:39:19] mad0monk: too many monks lol
[7:39:28] foxylady48: Cornwood is protecting Slacks, I dunno why some people don't it
[7:39:28] DeeterDo: yep, you got it
[7:39:31] mad0monk: I am the maddest of monks
[7:39:32] magnets_: yeah i truly don't understand the significance of the reports.
[7:39:47] Ficktions: @magnets_ Because making it private is hiding it... Hiding evidence lol

[7:40:06] Ficktions: @zenyatta I see what you did there LUL
[7:40:08] dakota22446: PotFriend
[7:40:09] Blanketslol: the report would be for the prosecution to try to push for evidence tampering I think
[7:40:16] DeeterDo: they being the prosecutors
[7:40:16] buddha_hands: probably because he has endless high-importance convos every single day OMEGALAUGHING @abdirahmanmomo
[7:40:20] Blanketslol: because they 'removed' it from the public
[7:40:21] foxylady48: Cornwood is protecting Slacks, I dunno why some people don't see it*

[9:26:24] m1tchole: You know they say that all men are created equal, but you look at me and you look at Duncan and you can see that statement is not true. See, normally if you go one on one with another captain, you got a 50/50 chance of winning. But I'm a genetic freak and I'm not normal! So you got a 25%, AT BEST, at beat me.
