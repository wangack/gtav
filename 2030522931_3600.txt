[3:26:55] nati204: Great video, then the game is.....
[3:26:59] zajima: True LUL
[3:27:00] avisern: @Strippin the idea is every time trynd ulties hes always fighting kindred to stay alive
[3:27:02] Rejnols: @Strippin The idea is Trynd is always almost dying (his ult) so i suppose in lore everytime he goes berserk he has to fight off Kindred because they are death
[3:27:02] 45pringles: actual
[3:27:07] Zaelsus: Yup
[3:27:08] WanCloud: Each and every one NODDERS

[3:29:15] Hobo1001: its just a very tiny little thing in all of them till Trynd
[3:29:17] Splargles: The point is kindred is always there, waiting
[3:29:21] Zaelsus: Can't claim Aatrox Sadge
[3:29:23] Plasmafenix: Aatrox is a sword
[3:29:23] Dasporo: CoolStoryBob

[3:29:37] Eburi87: Do you think they'll bring this level of cinematic for their MMO? Do you think they'll bring their MMO in our lifetimes? yuumiCry
[3:29:38] Voljindalari: Yasuo 1 is more obvious
[3:29:46] Velxir: Yasuo with stick
[3:29:55] WanCloud: Kindred is death, Aatrox can't die, so she watches him go back in his sword
[3:30:00] 45pringles: music is so good AAAA
[3:30:03] Hobo1001: its the tornado and then the arrow iirc right?
[3:30:03] Stickiler: @Eburi87 Maybe? And yes :)
[3:30:15] Rejnols: in the Yasuo scene, after he fires the tornado you can see wolfs eyes in the trees and the arrow that "kills" old man yasuo is kindred.
[3:30:16] T_blazian: @WanCloud he's a sword?
[3:30:36] opticalmouse100: Has Sam seen the stuff for Smite 2?
[3:30:43] Rejnols: @T_blazian Sealed in a sword, he was a former Ascended like Nasus and Renekton that got corrupted fighting the endless terrors of the void. So they become darkin
[3:30:45] Fransicko_: the wolf
[3:30:46] Plasmafenix: woof
[3:30:47] SciFiCHiCKtv: i seee

[3:31:15] T_blazian: @Rejnols Cool
[3:31:22] Rejnols: @Strippin can you find Kindred in this scene or do you need some help?
[3:31:24] Src248: So, Soul Calibur?
[3:31:29] Niethil: @Strippin neat part here is whenever Wolf attacks that's just a bandit
[3:31:30] MelliorBon: cant find kindred in this one

[3:31:34] Tyge11: @Rejnols LUL
[3:31:38] Falris: The Wolf goes after people that try to escape death, and The Lamb will shoot those that accept their death to grant them a swift and painless one
[3:31:47] Tahala: I also love the trynd fight cuz kindred is so confused
[3:31:58] Hobo1001: wife kills the lat of the people hunting him so he isnt in danger
[3:32:01] pandalisk9: NODDERS aatrox is a darkin, alongside kayne's scythe - rhaast and naafiri

[3:32:44] MichelleHemora: if only the game had an actual story
[3:32:46] Rejnols: @T_blazian yea so death split himself because he was lonely basicly
[3:32:48] Hobo1001: T_blazian Kindred is both lamb and wolf together
[3:32:56] T_blazian: Oh cute
[3:33:02] Tahala: who will win in a fight; the literal manifestation of death or one angry man
[3:33:05] Hobo1001: yep death was a Sadge boi so he made himself 2 to have company
[3:33:09] CthuhluIsNice: Still waiting on arcane season 2 man tomatoSad
[3:33:09] PinkRathian: @T_blazian think it was a 'im so lonely as an immortal so i tear myself into 2 people' thing
[3:33:11] DangerousLarry: trynd is fighting the guys surrounding him in the beginning, the fight with kindred is just a metaphor
[3:33:12] 45pringles: roit is really good at animation i feel
