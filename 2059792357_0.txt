[3:24:41] suijay: this is going to be like drying weed lol
[3:24:56] Weekend_fun: @jonathon_026 real life moonshine once its out of the still its good this just seems like an ingame mechanic to make the process longer to slow down grinders
[3:24:59] rexusmaximus: he left it in the still, not his house
[3:25:04] Rcninja6r: Barrels?
[3:25:06] Z0lVlBY: He kept in the distillery for 2h

[3:27:41] PwnUWithEz: What if its a rep thing where eventually you go from unrefined to high quality?
[3:28:17] zZEROo77: I would think that refined would be pulling out the bottles and using them in another cook

[3:39:11] woodywiththehoodie: What props you like
[3:39:17] ThreeNPink: @ThreeNPink that is what i was thinking becouse the new xpack for it on PS5 will be out on the 21st i think
[3:39:21] Takima80: enshrouded I heard takes less then 24 hours to beat
[3:39:33] gavinjames920: yep im going through them all now woody, there are a billion of them haha
[3:40:00] ThreeNPink: @Takima80 that is if you just do the main story stuff and dont explore every where
[3:40:28] woodywiththehoodie: Kittle over 3.5 receptions and kelce over .5 touchdowns
[3:40:30] Takima80: @ThreeNPink true but still that pretty meh for main content in my opinion
[3:40:35] sshineysean: leaving it sit wouldn‚Äôt really ‚Äúrefine‚Äù it‚Ä¶ running it through a filter (maybe)‚Ä¶ or as an ingredient in another batch would make more theoretical sense

[3:40:52] gavinjames920: i think there are 3 MVP bets I want.  The Mahomes price is a joke, so CMC, Pacheco, and then maybe like a Deebo

[3:41:22] MatthewLawrenc3: I like the idea of running it again in the still.  The do that irl to raise the proof
[3:41:25] TeiichixiXea: yea
[3:41:26] gavinjames920: Pacheco 30-1, if he rushes in 2 TDs for the Chiefs, and Mahomes maybe only throws 1 or has a couple picks, 30-1 could get there in a chiefs win
[3:41:33] lomgonecold: you never know  lol
[3:41:34] ThreeNPink: whole*
[3:41:35] BikeLife423: you could try to distill it again some people do that to make it smoother or to help the proof @shotz
