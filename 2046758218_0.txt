[1:59:13] kronogotthis: right now 2.5k butcoin is a good price
[1:59:13] mahtamsam: no one called about 5k GPU racks lmao thats 2.5k each butc and no one cares
[1:59:14] nik488: Lol
[1:59:14] hashir_tayyab1: there is no way 1000
[1:59:15] little_birdie27: Jammies

[1:59:17] Dark_Eyes32: hup
[1:59:17] Kitsoooooooo: classic
[1:59:18] luckerooni: you're still not dumb because the imaginary future app costs 1000 butc in the future not now
[1:59:18] SadPeypey: o7 band for basic math
[1:59:18] wyyndia: o7
[1:59:21] bleualtair: its obviously reliant on BUTC uses cases in the future.
[1:59:21] s1ipshod: 300k to buy what tho?
[1:59:23] dyds_samet: o7
[1:59:25] slurpy824: next app maybe 50 max

[1:59:27] I3ailey: cant hold on forever in hopes an update makes it go up
[1:59:28] thapeage: I think 2 to 3 is decent
[1:59:28] Bruno530: docnotL
[1:59:29] Hentai__Dad: the mining doesn‚Äôt get harder as time goes on, so it‚Äôs always going to be a race to the bottom price wise
[1:59:29] Naihz__: You calculated 283 per btc for a month from now. Not current price
[1:59:29] kronogotthis: BAND for basic math
[1:59:30] EsbrohBaby: o7
[1:59:31] NoTaGain15151: @DAIN5LEIF I can understand that but it might be meta because marty might not know
[1:59:31] InvestorP: they really need to fix the lag
[1:59:34] shmood19: yo omie how did you feel shooting guns with x. did you like shooting?
[1:59:34] Tee__Gee_: doesnt have to be the app
[1:59:35] Xernique: thats an insane gamble mto make
[1:59:35] cyracer1: idk if its unreasonable to assume itll be near 1000 coins
[1:59:35] farrq_mf: yeah but its all if and buts @omie
[1:59:36] excaliburgrog: 100
[1:59:38] Xernique: its 50 max
[1:59:38] mishdabeast: could be
[1:59:40] InvestorP: the lag is getting out of hand
[1:59:40] kallert_: next app is 50+ prob
[1:59:41] BlacKnight2514: yea but OOC you know devs aint making the apps worth more than 10 BC @omie

[1:59:44] slurpy824: 20-50
[1:59:44] Pure36: @omie you could just call up the company and make a deal
[1:59:45] daha1e: did you make profit tho
[1:59:45] thumbs_again: maybe 50ish
[1:59:45] farrq_mf: exactly
[1:59:46] luvvkoa: i could see 100
[1:59:46] buyremdesivir: you've made the right decision Marty, I will expect buttcoin to be $1k soon
[1:59:47] Tee__Gee_: could be something you buy via drone like he said
[1:59:50] splooshtasticals: I hope they put in a coin with liquidity behind it then shit gets crazy good
[1:59:51] BlueAndTheGray: It's worth whatever people are willing to pay for it
[1:59:51] bike_rider99: 100 for sure

[1:59:53] krilosrs: crime just down bad right now
[1:59:53] masiaxo: if theyre giving so much time to farm it it must be high
[1:59:56] Xernique: KEKW
[1:59:57] BlacKnight2514: nope
[1:59:57] curshew: i would assume the robberies thing will be like 20 to set up and maybe 5 per run
[1:59:57] Board2Dank: i think its the robbery contracts that are gonna cost alot
[1:59:58] Shadowdott: Shrug oh whale
[1:59:58] rs_xspartacus: 100 +
[1:59:58] cyracer1: ok yea
[1:59:58] BlacKnight2514: KEKW
[1:59:59] blarticuspaul: Clueless lil bro doesnt know next app is 2.5m BUTC
[1:59:59] Kitsoooooooo: ‚ò†Ô∏è
[1:59:59] Basmage: I mean if its 1k it will be even worth less cause it would be too expensive otherwise
[2:00:00] Thejokerfai: If the robbery cost 50, and the profit is like 50k from the robbery they got scammed
[2:00:00] hashir_tayyab1: KEKW
[2:00:02] luckerooni: it's almost guaranteed this butc market inflation will almost definitely be solved with contract auctions until everyone uses all their butc
[2:00:03] chefezbake: glad u up little bro at that point just run it with a group have them buy ggs. didn‚Äôt have malice towards u I enjoy your streams @omie
[2:00:03] imylgu: even at 50-100 its a easy 5x in price
[2:00:04] PhantomZihaa: @omie langs house plus Larry‚Äôs house is like 70 butc a day anyway
[2:00:04] EsbrohBaby: Sure
[2:00:05] nik488: 50 max
[2:00:05] ItsSkaara: Maybe some plans for a mega heist
[2:00:06] cjohno20: You're completing omitting the value in spending buttcoin on robberies. If 50BC gets you a chance at 100k from a bank, that's an extra 2k in value immediately @omie
[2:00:06] Maxwon: i think contracts gonna cost BUTC
[2:00:07] OrangesArePurple: Even if its 50 he has it in 3 days
[2:00:08] BoywithVIP: omieDanse omieDanse omieDanse omieDanse omieDanse
[2:00:08] Shadowdott: YEP WHY NOT I GOT THERE 1st
[2:00:08] ozzenzo: Remember Lang selling at $500 Dentge
[2:00:10] TheAsvin: the next app that wont work for 2 weeks
[2:00:10] 11_Brad_11: there's just zero demand in a week once everyone has racks
[2:00:10] thapeage: think it‚Äôll be a auction for contracts
[2:00:13] bleualtair: if BUTC is used for boosting like GNE used to be it‚Äôs gonna skyrocket in price
[2:00:14] Va1ar_Morghulis: Robberies fitting to be ButtCoin Bid wars.
[2:00:15] sh4gun: watch the next app be something stupid like instagram or something KEKW
[2:00:15] Tistover: omE
[2:00:17] Pure36: Depends what the app does
[2:00:18] Tee__Gee_: wouldnt just be an app obviously
[2:00:18] EsbrohBaby: TRUEING
[2:00:18] HealzonWheelzY: app before HQ was 3btc, next one will be 30
[2:00:19] Disihe211: üíÄ house money for a google play app
[2:00:19] hashir_tayyab1: Kappa
[2:00:19] JustCallMeBoss: what if robbery contracts are bids? @omie
[2:00:20] InvestorP: i hope the app is 100 but
[2:00:23] Shadowdott: YEP WHY NOT I GOT THERE 1st I MAKE VALUE
[2:00:23] little_birdie27: Jammies Jammies
[2:00:26] TropicalToucan: People need to think about who actually has that money in the server LUL
[2:00:26] kingslayer1007ba: wait u have 400k ?
[2:00:27] imylgu: lol ph damn you really did change
[2:00:27] thatguyfisk: Just the hq app was 10, 100% they're going to be higher than that
[2:00:28] excaliburgrog: for sure contract will cost butcoin
[2:00:29] SadPeypey: mhm
[2:00:30] silentwinter99: PopNemo
[2:00:31] purthsk: if you dont have a house by now you aint doin shit anyways
[2:00:32] Rhysing: @HealzonWheelzY was 10
[2:00:33] BlacKnight2514: yep
[2:00:34] iDyex7: I think in the future there will be apps jobs that u can buy with buttcoin it will also be cool if Gun BP where purchase with but. u are being smart do
[2:00:34] shmood19: omie i wanna kiss you mane
[2:00:36] ohwoah1: HODL
[2:00:37] Just5abL: I don‚Äôt think it would be 1k cuz this ain‚Äôt Xcoin , the farming method is longer.. might be 100 bc tho
[2:00:39] mano_eu_desisto: but bro just think on all effort to have a set ut to farm a btc and you "have" to sell 200 per because its "basic math", it's kinda shit
[2:00:40] BlacKnight2514: PREACH omie
[2:00:41] splooshtasticals: Peeps thinking too LUL They played it smart
[2:00:42] Pure36: @omie if the app gives access to bank robberies than it might be worth 250k
[2:00:43] davids0p: next app will be 50 coins minimum
[2:00:43] Shadowdott: NODDERS
[2:00:45] armomammer: only way the company make back their investment is if the robbery contracts are based on bidding
[2:00:48] Xernique: yeah, there are so many groups, on all timezones
[2:00:49] farrq_mf: bro houses are a good play atm mainly coz they cant get touched @omie
[2:00:51] IcyMurd3rn0va: @omie make sure to save up some cash for the inevitable power bill
[2:00:52] kronogotthis: a lot of people are farming butc
[2:00:56] buyremdesivir: auctioned contracts would be sick
[2:00:56] s1ipshod: yeah now you, Lang and his dogs have sold btc for nothing everyone is closer??
[2:00:57] BigChocollate: If the devs weigh how fast things progressed on the first round of apps, i can guarantee they will raise app/bp requirements next go around
[2:00:58] DatKyler: The companies farming is ridiculous, they should sell for 1k, they have wayy to much coin
[2:00:58] Pinorthead: well at $250 a coin then 50 but for a new app would be reasonable right
[2:00:58] wilboyx: @omie your voice does something to me...
[2:00:59] bonewp: OMEGALUL AND ONE POINTS ALSO THAT IT DOESNT MAKE SENSE EITHER IS BECAUSE IN 4.0 THEY TRYING TO STABILIZE THE ECONOMY SO 250K FOR NEXT AP I DONT THINK SO KEKW
[2:01:03] Rhysing: people also hardly need that many coins, right now, what are you spending them on
[2:01:04] mano_eu_desisto: but bro just think on all effort to have a set ut to farm a btc and you "have" to sell 200 per because its "basic math", it's kinda shit Û†ÄÄ
[2:01:04] ya__zz: some people need to use their brain sometimes and realize your right
[2:01:06] brayy_dee: there are so many people farming that shit lol
[2:01:07] marzisrippin: yeah they think it‚Äôs 3.0 still with the economy
[2:01:08] SadPeypey: @Pure36 then the robberies would have to yield more thatn 250k omE
[2:01:09] I3ailey: id like to see how much butc actually moves a day, like i feel like there are 0 sales and people are just spouting out numbers
[2:01:10] Just5abL: with the lumber 30$ bs , there a lot of money moving around lysO
[2:01:11] cjohno20: You're completing omitting the value in spending buttcoin on robberies. If 30BC gets you a chance at 100k from a bank, that's an about 3k in value immediately added @omie

[2:01:13] kingslayer1007ba: how much money u have
[2:01:16] luckerooni: i would guess theres at least 4 groups in each time zone separately farming 20+ butc
[2:01:17] Shadowdott: Dentge MUST SPEED RUN Dentge
[2:01:19] 69yoloswagmaster420: marty starting the power union

[2:01:27] farrq_mf: o7 power bill

[2:01:32] slurpy824: ????
[2:01:33] mirasghost: eventually one of the apps is gonna have a butc sink where u can use all the extra but
[2:01:35] Kitsoooooooo: bro
[2:01:36] slurpy824: 3k lmao
[2:01:36] KamyabGOAT: Chatting Û†ÄÄ
[2:01:37] luvvkoa: @farrq_mf houses are good because with each house bought the price goes up. so if u buy early ur house will be worth more
[2:01:39] chefezbake: there are many farming butt but not at an obsurd amount like lang and company
[2:01:40] mano_eu_desisto: but bro just think on all effort to have a set ut to farm a btc and you "have" to sell 200 per because its "basic math", it's kinda shit Û†ÄÄ
[2:01:41] SadPeypey: ALL OF YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT HYPOTHETICALS omE
[2:01:42] Stealthy_Giraffe: i feel like early progression usually does cater to only a couple groups
[2:01:44] lowvr6tj: not true, look at luxury cars and homes in real life. unrealistic prices but people will buy
[2:01:45] Rhysing: the value of coins should tank if their only current use is just scaling their own collection
[2:01:45] splooshtasticals: pokeHmm
[2:01:47] little_birdie27: catsittingverycomfortable
[2:01:49] cakewalkz: the future will be Butc = heists
[2:01:51] Bruno530: every mf would be farming like 50k a day just from buttcoin with no work at all
[2:01:53] Tee__Gee_: if its an auction then not really
[2:01:54] Dark_Eyes32: bro I‚Äôll say this man, this is some really cool rp man
[2:01:55] luckerooni: why are people theorycrafting the future value of butc that doesn't exist while today people are farming butc and it's sitting on a pc doing absolutely nothing
[2:01:55] DatKyler: I think you might have to bid on contracts. That'd be interesting
[2:01:56] 11_Brad_11: that assumes people NEED butc, everyone has it
[2:01:57] RandomNicknameYep: It's obvious the app will give access to something crazy. Selling that low sounds crazy
[2:01:57] k0pite: k0pite subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months! buh

[2:02:02] purthsk: @Stealthy_Giraffe GrinderW
[2:02:05] Futendoji: the thing is, the stuff has started to not only cost butcoin, but $ too
[2:02:05] BoywithVIP: most ppl only see Company ,CG and Lang group only ones in the city catSmash DIESOFCRINGE
[2:02:07] Xernique: yeah we in the building stages still, gotta focus on that
[2:02:07] krilosrs: crime just sucks rn, and X cant even do a job like g6 so selling computer stuff is his main income
[2:02:08] rs_xspartacus: @omie down the line u cant buy more racks

[2:02:15] TemplarT1: buh
[2:02:15] bbboi7: tbf rack description says limeited
[2:02:15] Basmage: If the racks are limited it changes the whole game tho
[2:02:16] atramentum_: Nerd ok smart guy can you rob a bank already ???
[2:02:17] dambabygurl: Dentge yes people aren't thinking
[2:02:17] darkzxy0: buh
[2:02:17] AyoMIXES: bro what happen to ur car üò≠
[2:02:18] common_idiot: ain't no way the buy in is equal the payout. that would be stupid, why take a risk just to guarantee a loss
[2:02:18] s1ipshod: the value has tanked because you and Lang have made the entry cost wayyy too low
[2:02:18] Bruno530: buh
[2:02:20] Just5abL: DID YOU ASK A DEV FOR CAR FIX? gravCry
[2:02:21] NoTaGain15151: @RandomNicknameYep it's mass production is so easy not need to invest too early
[2:02:23] luvvkoa: @iDyex7 they arent
[2:02:23] thatguyfisk: Racks are limited though no? Thought they're eventually going away. So down the line won't work if they gone
[2:02:23] excaliburgrog: I think that in the future u will need butcoin to buy pieces to make gun
[2:02:24] ozzenzo: Hows the casino going?
[2:02:24] iDyex7: it‚Äôs says in the app they will go away
[2:02:24] Lesbifriend: @luckerooni bc there's nothing to do with it but farm it and buy apps
[2:02:24] analysislover17: no but omie you forgot about buh
[2:02:25] Naihz__: (Meta) im a dev the next drone purchase will cost 1000 buh
[2:02:25] nezzbear: there should be a max on racks
[2:02:25] Pure36: @sadpeypey its not about yielding 250k its about the fact that if you have that access over other groups than they have a monopoly on easy money
[2:02:25] sh4gun: but what does ja rule think about the price of butt
[2:02:29] 3lonpich: On the description of the BPs, it says its available for limited time, I wonder if that will really be the case
[2:02:30] brooksreaper123: am I wrong or would they not buy like 10 off you then start there own operation
[2:02:32] chefezbake: are u gonna buy a cool car soon @omie
[2:02:33] piyu20031: yeah if there are bid on contracts company will probably get every single one

[2:03:06] Jonk: EZ
[2:03:08] DatKyler: Thats actually the only way the companies farm pays off is if you have to bid for contracts and highest bidder of butcoin wins
[2:03:09] Blueypug: nico got 4head on yo ass
[2:03:10] lowvr6tj: 4.0 seems like a great change, but a speedrun and everyone wants everything NOW , the process of ‚Äúleveling up‚Äù seems gone , diminish the price and value of things so we can have them NOW, instead of working and grinding them out
[2:03:11] yungsamd17: EZ

[2:03:17] farrq_mf: @farrq_mf yeah exactly its the things ppl NEED that will go up not wants, also buying a good car n renting it out could be a play

[2:03:42] andrewibrah1m: youre welcome
[2:03:50] Chroni9: -15 for cyd
[2:03:51] cjohno20: the point is that Buttcoin has utility that increases its value beyond its mining cost. If racks are limited like the app says, people won't be able to infinitely scale
[2:03:53] OrangesArePurple: Did you account for cyd -15
[2:03:58] WinkCLtv: morto banko
[2:04:01] krilosrs: @Xernique I mean he maxed his fence rep fast af and its been useless, all crime has just sucked LUL he is bored af with the current jobs
