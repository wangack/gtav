[8:01:10] boogie1337: @4HEAD (sorry wall of text) "null" is a special value in programming what means no value. I assume issue is that developers didn't add any validation, so you pretty much named it as "null" by mistake (someone did). If it was coded properly, validation would not let you name that. "Null" name can cause different issues, like you see other texts, blocked options, because code is checking often someThing == null -> then -> disable something etc.
