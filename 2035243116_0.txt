[8:17:04] alanmc30: you’re going to get your pp slapped
[8:17:22] mosthatedlayla: Heyy
[8:17:35] Athasin: You reference it so that they don't have to scour the evidence tab looking for the evidence you're talking about
[8:17:43] EGGZOLENTZ: @jexjex1 Aziz is right, even if its a picutre of it. You write it as well even if it sounds stupid and extra stepps to do so
[8:18:03] xypher85: it does make sense
[8:18:10] xtrainhobo: Just do it to cover your ass
[8:18:15] momzzyy: bro dont fumble another report G take the help
[8:18:16] EGGZOLENTZ: @deansocool if someone reads it, it should tell the m what the picture os of
[8:18:25] dubbini: Eyyy if ruth says it makes sense itll make sense
[8:18:28] jonski1220: learn from Aziz just do it
[8:18:30] StrawHatShaneo: Personally I don't think it sound stupid, but I can understand why you think it does
[8:18:37] xtrainhobo: what harm is there in doing it, vs you getting yelled at for not doing it.
[8:18:39] jexjex1: yes, just to get a better flow in your case
[8:18:43] EGGZOLENTZ: So a 3 year old should be able to read it and understand basically
[8:18:48] Athasin: It's like a paper, where you quote something and in parenthesis you put the name and page of the quote. And that reference coincides with a "works cited" page.
[8:18:48] xsilas43: yea still gotta articulate it even if theres a picture
[8:18:49] kb420ps: Aziz is right. You have to be very THOROUGH in your reports.  You need to write them as if Captain Ruth is going to examine them with a microscope.
[8:19:02] Athasin: Yeah, do that
[8:19:02] alanmc30: you’re going to have a sore little pp deansoSmoke
[8:19:04] EGGZOLENTZ: As a lawyer you can say its a different car

[8:19:21] detoksi: your eplaining what the evidence is with your statement
[8:19:23] kb420ps: Because,  Captain Ruth is examining your reports with a microscope.
[8:19:27] marneraiders: I think he means the „Vehicles“ section
[8:19:27] daboytay: u need to type everything

[8:19:47] EGGZOLENTZ: LUL LUL
[8:19:53] kb420ps: Ruth likes Aziz reports.
[8:19:56] detoksi: cant just have random evidence and not tell in the report what the evidence is
[8:20:05] jas3370: you need to reference the specific piece of evidence in your writing because it is directing the reader to view the evidence section
[8:20:18] xsilas43: even if you got a video you still gotta articulate it Shruge
[8:20:20] Athasin: @kb420ps "Judges" like Aziz's reports.

[9:21:18] Real_Bugz: Denzel got 2 officers who offered to help/do his reports and still doesn’t reach out.
[9:21:22] Xellwrath: @kingscarycow yes of course haha. only when there is a chase or an active scene, i'm actively watching. otherwise its just 2nd monitor content while I game on my main monitor
[9:21:25] Athasin: @xypher85 And then DAP'd him for performing a sting she approved of and not waiting for EMS to drive up north
