[4:16:44] Nidgarm: paying money to watch a hot tub stream VOD so it isn't even live.. cmonBruh
[4:17:04] skoton: @are_sea thats why i can see what you mean, but i also think if its her disc she kinda has the say, the sub makes her know the person is "committed" and not just a troll
[4:17:06] oneALMONDMILKplease: yes and it's unfair
[4:17:07] skoton: nah
[4:17:09] HappysFunPalace: makes sense
