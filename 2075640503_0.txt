[2:31:20] Rozmere: Cara Korvus has her snakes on her channel occassionally and everybody loves them but they aren't the main focus of the channel
[2:31:52] jimothy64: I feel like, because you wanna make the geckos into a distinct business, a separate channel might prove more useful in the long run
[2:32:03] ApocAFK: And could always eventually transition to a new channel as well, get a little bit of the audience over to a new spot, if it ever became needed
[2:32:18] CatGotYourKeyboard: That's a good point, @jimothy64

[5:24:09] JoeayIV: and then match the other cord
[5:24:22] JoeayIV: so it lines up with the back racks
[5:25:25] JoeayIV: so the rack behind the latest one
[5:25:30] QuesoCommander: like you did the first one I think
[5:25:35] jimothy64: Copy them onto the three placed against the wall, then drag them forward, rather than laterally
[5:25:37] JoeayIV: you'd copy the cords and then just have it match the 2nd row
[5:25:59] JoeayIV: i think its Y that you copy from the 2nd row?
[5:26:35] JoeayIV: probably yea
[5:28:45] QuesoCommander: now to make an optical illusion that hides the racks when you walk in so that Jay has a heart attack
[5:29:18] dragonesk22: finally someone setting up racks as batteries and. not wallpapers

[5:30:19] QuesoCommander: or subtract I guess cause max is 180 I think
[5:30:30] JoeayIV: um
[5:30:36] QuesoCommander: -136.43?
[5:30:37] DJayEnzyme: 223.57
[5:30:39] jimothy64: Lighting suggestion; blue tube lights either in the floor or ceiling.. give it that sci-fi server room feel
[5:30:43] JoeayIV: whats the starting number?
[5:30:47] Jen848: I'm glad you guys are good with the numbers
[5:30:57] silverarrows47: saabWiggle

[5:32:30] jimothy64: Try the railings from Flop's
[5:32:31] JoeayIV: someone said railings i think
[5:32:46] JoeayIV: idk
[5:33:04] jimothy64: Flush Along the bottom, purely decorative

[5:36:49] JoeayIV: needs to come down
[5:36:51] JoeayIV: a tiny amount
[5:39:21] six_slayz: put the 857 pokey sticks on the wall 🫢

[5:55:51] jimothy64: The furniture was very Scandinavian in the showroom he liked.. looked exactly like an IKEA chair I have lol
[5:56:23] KenobiiCrafts: idk why from an engineering standpoint wall are not entered as vectors so you can just make the custom shape and size you need and not do this kinda hookie wall janga.
[5:57:18] nobodybodon: this isn't the sims, its modded GTAV
[5:58:06] JoeayIV: MORE TVs
[5:58:13] JoeayIV: DESKCHAN
[5:58:22] nobodybodon: I'm sure its TECHNICALLY possible to create custom wall sizes like that, but at what cost?
[5:59:48] KenobiiCrafts: @nobodybodon right 100% get that but i've done work with 3d development and i see the walls being a huge function that would improve life, b/c then you can move the feature/component over for walls etc. But i'm not taking away the coolness the NP dev have made.
[6:00:07] KenobiiCrafts: @KenobiiCrafts floors*
[6:03:19] KenobiiCrafts: @nobodybodon so the dementions are set right to a default(s), so you would be able to chance or add your own as needed and if it got really fancy you could add in svg import that wrap the wall so you can bring in your own styles ect. But if your talking processing cost, it would be minimal, or do you mean is the time/effort put in not better spent else ware from a dev/production stand point?
[6:03:31] two_time_jimmy02: The dragon is ruthless right now kebunCG
[6:03:57] Crazyman114: can those pony's become people?
[6:04:26] nobodybodon: @KenobiiCrafts yeah I meant how much work would you need to put in to get that to work VS things that benefit a lot more people. decorating is pretty niche.
[6:04:27] KenobiiCrafts: @KenobiiCrafts sorry if im being a little to "extra" on this, i can get carried away with stuff like this

[6:05:36] nobodybodon: @kiriel09 not being a good driver is a pretty good excuse to not be baby driver
[6:05:40] nobodybodon: just saying
[6:05:40] Bi0_: I heard Tessa moonlights as the get away driver for CG.

[6:06:00] kiriel09: @nobodybodon nah, NAH I say
[6:06:02] KenobiiCrafts: @Bi0_ is she replacing Chawa as the CG driver?!
[6:06:26] Bi0_: @KenobiiCrafts Na, just a replacement when Chawa isn't available...but arguably better. cahlaVVV
[6:07:02] Bi0_: I mean look at that skil weaving between traffic.

[6:07:13] JoeayIV: FOR FEAR OF DEATH
[6:07:22] KenobiiCrafts: @Bi0_ not gunna lie i saw chawa run over a cow once and i think CG needs a driver who is amazing but ALSO respects animal life
[6:07:47] boggrt: COGGERS
[6:07:47] Bi0_: @KenobiiCrafts Wow...Chawa really has fallen.
[6:07:53] Bi0_: Look at that pro 360

[6:09:16] retrowolf0498: It's because of U-Tool.

[6:11:08] KenobiiCrafts: @Bi0_ she is speed
[6:11:28] Bi0_: Might be the fastest car and driver on the server tbh.
[6:11:54] Bi0_: Look at that, I bet Shawa would have wrecked right there.
[6:12:25] KenobiiCrafts: @Bi0_ true true, his nickname is crash Johnson don't ya know

[6:16:23] Jen848: nice one, @kiriel09 Any particular kind of peppers? I love them
[6:16:51] KenobiiCrafts: @Bi0_ thats like telling the sun not to shine, her speed is to prevalent, tbh
[6:17:14] Bi0_: I mean look at the shirt and car....they are shining as bright as the sun.
[6:18:11] KenobiiCrafts: @Bi0_ its almost too bright, OR is she sooo fast she is attracting light and thus only looks like its yellow from the light

[6:59:03] kiriel09: Goddamn dystopian IKEA future
[6:59:05] Jen848: It's just decorating ffs
[6:59:17] natas_ttv: 10$ per mat?
[7:00:04] OldCatLady: napkin math is confusing
[7:00:16] kiriel09: Just charge a service fee on top
[7:00:25] silverarrows47: Naw they can charge for the labor
[7:00:28] silverarrows47: KEKW
[7:00:31] kiriel09: So way cheaper but still getting money
[7:00:39] Bi0_: You charge for your knowledge and labor though.  o.O'
[7:00:56] natas_ttv: he is telling u he needs money without saying it
[7:01:27] Bi0_: So cahrge for that, not the mats. no?

[7:02:28] silverarrows47: What company is that? Not Nikea
[7:02:43] Bi0_: So if you do all mats. Then they do like 10k that's profit for them w/o mats, no?
[7:03:10] silverarrows47: Oh wow..furniture actually should be more expensive
[7:03:31] dbuana: Nikea is better
[7:03:39] Bi0_: Tessa the pot head.  =3
[7:04:31] Bi0_: he's basically ready for war.
[7:05:00] kiriel09: They need to look at how mechanic shops price. Cost of labor plus cost of materials. You can still make an easy profit and charge a tiny fraction

[7:06:23] natas_ttv: lol
[7:06:37] Bi0_: so sideboard is 5k.
[7:06:40] kiriel09: So then add a cost per blueprint use and add that. The econ major in me is just dying inside
[7:06:44] nobodybodon: WHY IS A RAILING 1k
[7:06:49] nobodybodon: nakkiNLT
[7:06:55] natas_ttv: ya two railing it what they are giving tessa
[7:06:58] nobodybodon: a whole ass wall is half that
[7:07:01] Bi0_: @kiriel09 this
[7:07:13] OldCatLady: I mean it looks like a lot of their profit goes right back into the business. lots of benches right there alone
[7:07:38] dbuana: ....
[7:07:41] jimothy64: It sounds like all these items use far too many materials, which is then compounded by the current insane material prices..
[7:07:44] silverarrows47: @kiriel09 That's what I'm saying. The blueprint degrades the same if they are making a piece with their own materials or without
[7:07:56] silverarrows47: OMEGALUL

[7:08:43] jimothy64: Why is a basic chair 2k ffs
[7:08:54] natas_ttv: who sets their prices
[7:08:59] kiriel09: Obviously I'm an old lady so this stuff seems super obvious to me, but I get that it might not be clear to them. Game developers literally hire PhD economists to design in-game economies
[7:09:15] silverarrows47: Heck might as well buy the railings KEKW
[7:09:20] nobodybodon: I mean, you're also assuming the reasons why
[7:09:32] nobodybodon: we haven't seen their math or how the calculate these prices
[7:09:36] StreamElements: Feel free to join my Discord flock, 5000 members and growing! https://discordapp.com/invite/nakkida

[7:10:49] nobodybodon: since the high quality graphics cards cost 500 circuit boards, if any of the other stuff is a similar amount thats 5k of just materials. he said 10$ each earlier.
[7:10:57] jimothy64: Remember when materials were $3 per?
[7:12:14] jimothy64: Everyone grinding for circuit boards, everything else falling by the wayside.
[7:12:58] OldCatLady: I think it's exactly that, jimothy
[7:16:07] jimothy64: Only one real source of mats, and it's all pouring into GPUs, so everything is inflating. It's the old recycling centre dilemma but self-reinforcing
[7:17:04] nobodybodon: the dog bed comes with a dog tessaShocked
[7:17:21] WaffleHaaze: Zero explanation lol
[7:17:23] Jen848: at least a deal is possible
[7:17:50] nobodybodon: mats being 10 each + blueprint rarity + crafting time was my takeaway
[7:18:26] OldCatLady: also the time spent to get wood cutting reputation up
[7:19:13] JoeayIV: good on you chat
[7:19:15] JoeayIV: no one said a thing
[7:19:21] jimothy64: Just need the GPU bubble to burst so things other than circuit boards are available in decent quantities.. get the prices down
[7:19:22] retrowolf0498: I'm surprised that's all still there

[7:21:29] jimothy64: Everyone wants circuit boards so everything else basically doesn't exist in the market
[7:21:40] Bi0_: new job...mining.  =P
[7:21:52] syedamaheenali: lysPopcorn lysPopcorn
[7:21:57] wavep987: I think the way mats market can be fixed is by taking away the recylables. Everyone converts it to circuit boards.
[7:21:57] silverarrows47: I wonder how the big boys can keep up with material gathering demands?

[7:23:46] SharkBait_1410: if you earn more from sani then there would be more people doing it so there should be more material
[7:23:50] sage40k: people grinding the anti grind stuff? lol
[7:23:56] dbuana: Those guys are scammer better buy from nikea
[7:24:20] zalgo2028: nakkiLoveBlue nakkiLoveBlue nakkiLoveBlue nakkiLoveBlue nakkiLoveBlue nakkiLoveBlue nakkiLoveBlue nakkiLoveBlue nakkiLoveBlue nakkiLoveBlue
[7:24:42] JoeayIV: gotta skim a little off the top every grind and then unload and sell to someone
[7:24:55] Bi0_: yeah just seemed like a smart business move for them is if you bring mats, we want say blueprint cost plus idk 50% or something for labor/time/knowledge.
[7:25:21] JoeayIV: and add a nice TV to the server room for L I G H T I N G
[7:25:38] baka_baka_vinny: Enjoy your rp! Thanks, Nakkida!
[7:25:56] Matrix8369: Are you still an admin in 4.0?
[7:26:07] TheJRoller: i think groups are supposed to be self sustaining and have people in all jobs but to me it seems like people are hyper focusing trying to get ahead in one facit on the ratrace
[7:26:11] Bi0_: woodworker tessa!  lol
[7:26:40] jimothy64: Blueprints seem like a delicate balance, but the only way to bring material prices down is to disincentivise turning everything into circuit boards.. which doesn't sound easy to do either
[7:27:06] solowanderor: imo there is a lot of new so super high demand i think it will level out
[7:27:14] sage40k: i live near sf, sounds about right nakkiTired
[7:27:28] KindaTru: The bench alone to make furniture is 25k, i don't see 20k being too much
[7:27:36] silverarrows47: I'm curious..how do cops survive in 4.0? I don't think they make that much money and have to pay for everything PD related. Good luck to them getting houses/etc unless they do side jobs
[7:27:43] jimothy64: And no other source of mats meaning we're basically in the same spot as the recycling centre
[7:27:47] TheJRoller: is there a limit to the amount of racks that can link together?
[7:27:51] wavep987: wood is also a bottleneck, boring to chop, cumbersome utility, difficult to store. Add materials and its a depressing picture.
[7:28:49] retrowolf0498: I think PD is one of the better paying jobs outside of Mayor's office/cabinet.
[7:28:53] Jen848: I've seen some cops doing gruppe 6
[7:29:35] baka_baka_vinny: If ya nudge Jack tomorrow, he'll likely be able to break down the costs to a tee for ya and likely cut a deal too for Tessa

[7:30:07] Matrix8369: the main bottle neck is you have to have friends to progress
[7:30:12] Jen848: house spawn weeeeee!
