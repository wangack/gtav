[0:30:44] Ryyo_: oh, thats cool
[0:31:01] PeachTwirl: yep. Means it's not just copy and paste for people
[0:31:37] uitzui: i have a question, do we think it's possible the second slot could be also HI or mQ?
[0:31:59] Thrath: @uitzui Its possible to have multiple I would assume
[0:32:41] Madam_Orange: KEKW
[0:32:44] RezaQ8: KEKW
[0:32:46] uitzui: i guess we will see, if none of the 3 batches hit average it might be hi or mq kivaSus
[0:33:13] Thrath: Yeah and if what Rod said its possible for a coarse element to be in your recipe too
[0:35:52] RadahTatTat: kivaHi kivaTrash

[0:36:53] Madam_Orange: @Thrath yeah, but rod also said one of the all the same could be average, so maybe his recipe was a bit different of a journey kivaSus
[0:37:09] RadahTatTat: @madam_orange kivaTrash kivaFlower
[0:37:24] Thrath: @Madam_Orange Yuh just gotta see how Ant's recipe progresses so far I doubt there will be a coarse element tbh
[0:37:46] Madam_Orange: SCIENCE
[0:37:52] RadahTatTat: kivaNotes
[0:38:03] uitzui: i just had an idea for optimizing the process a little bit, what if there were labeled and sectioned off spaces in the house for the different areas that the runs go to kivaSus
[0:38:18] uitzui: so when they get sorted the order persists through storms
[0:38:48] space_cowboy_69_: kivaCozy
[0:38:54] RadahTatTat: since numbers hurt my brain i will just nod and look at my new fave emote Gladge kivaTrash

[0:43:40] Thrath: nns actively adding sliders right now EZY Clap
[0:43:55] RezaQ8: Casino was a fever dream
[0:44:10] uitzui: but what if you had to do sani to get parts so you can build stills kivaSus
[0:44:20] GalovicV: kivaCozy
[0:44:28] Thrath: Probably 125ish
[0:44:32] uitzui: never you just hit the point of not enough stills
[0:44:34] Anrisacia: When your bags are full NODDERS
[0:44:47] RadahTatTat: I realized that y’all have the perfect cars for Dukes Of Hazard themed moonshine runs kivaLUL
[0:44:52] RadahTatTat: Daisy Dukes outfits for all NODDERS
[0:45:00] Random_Slacker: I mean worst case you could probably start selling batches of materials, ez money
[0:45:11] honor234567: you need butcoin for the bulprint for the stills and need sani parts to make them kivaLUL
[0:45:23] RadahTatTat: @random_slacker NODDERS sewer grocery store
[0:45:31] RezaQ8: Basically the pain was people not understanding the math
[0:45:35] RezaQ8: and trying to brute force it
[0:45:50] RezaQ8: So they were brute forcing 3 sliders that had 100 values each
[0:45:55] RadahTatTat: maybe too many combo options kivaWhat
[0:46:00] uitzui: ye Glorion was the first perfect one because he just mathd it
[0:46:07] imdeatht1: Yeah gloryon found the algorithm for it
[0:46:27] PolishFalcons32: 3 sliders with 100 values instead of the 5 "sliders" with 10 options
[0:46:32] RezaQ8: With math you could get to the perfect one in 5 cooks
[0:46:32] DJ_4point0: It's like an order of magnitude more possibilities to moonshine
[0:46:39] uitzui: but there was also a mechanical suffering because the sliders kinda sucked, especially in the very beginning, and you had to be very particual in how you moved them to actually hit the values you wanted to use. Got a bit better over time but still
[0:47:45] uitzui: yeah all the systems in NP generally get improved with each big patch cycle. Same for hacks, 3.0 was infinitely better than 2.0 minigames
[0:48:13] Thrath: 2.0 ddr was insane KEKW

[0:48:54] yungVDD: You're blue now! kivaHype
[0:48:57] Thrath: 2.0 ddr was so laggy that some people had to start capping their framerate at 30 for it to be smooth
[0:49:03] inus2: sliders were only a part of the meth suffering though, the meth discords were another big part and then all the in-character drama over it at the start of 3.0 kivaLUL
[0:49:17] AdamElJefe: Basically yeah, that's my approach to devving at least
[0:49:24] uitzui: yeah not even just framerate there were players who changed their resolution as well so they could do it KEKW
[0:49:32] AdamElJefe: Throw something at the wall, then refine it
[0:50:08] uitzui: of the fact that the paleto heist was so scuffed that they never got the gate inside the mini vault to open so it was just standard practice people used to "sit" through it with an emote
[0:50:34] DJ_4point0: And even when you try an idea, it might just never be fun no matter how refined. So you just gotta try something else
[0:51:37] RezaQ8: I really thought they would put in a wordle minigame at the height of that craze
[0:51:43] RezaQ8: Would have been pretty easy and funny
[0:52:13] imdeatht1: gta geoguesser hack
[0:52:31] RezaQ8: gta geoguesser would be funny
[0:52:44] DJ_4point0: And if the answer was the same for every that day, the first people who solve it could sell that info.
[0:53:46] uitzui: it would be funny for a hacker to run into their hacker friend and both complain about how odd the contexto that day was
[0:54:04] Ryyo_: kivaJammies
[0:54:29] ashton_ak23: it’s probably not the safest but I use a knife to scratch my back
[0:55:03] RezaQ8: @ashton_ak23 I like how you said "probably" ...

[2:51:09] Madam_Orange: so about $4,772 made today kivaNotes
[2:51:13] Madam_Orange: so far
[2:51:43] Madam_Orange: probably more tho cause i did a low average for all the below average ones
[2:51:53] Vizi797: So there's a chance the top end is 100 for that batch, just got unlucky with the drop offs kivaSus
[2:52:03] Thrath: kivaSus I have a feeling mQ is not in the perfect slot just yet
[2:52:22] Anrisacia: Or one of the last two are just dragging it down really hard
[2:52:22] uitzui: it's possible
[2:52:41] uitzui: but being in average land is already really good
[2:52:51] Madam_Orange: can switch it around later NODDERS
[2:53:28] Thrath: Yeah I think those 3 elements got the average and once you are around 115 you can micromanage the slots
[2:53:44] uitzui: i mean they didn't really tilt it on their own, mQ was pushing anything to below average on it's own before that
[2:53:58] uitzui: but once we see the data of the last to gamba slots it will be easier to tell
[2:54:17] Thrath: Unless there is a dupe element in there somewhere
[2:54:22] Madam_Orange: figure out the last 2 and then mess with it NODDERS
[2:54:48] Thrath: But the 10 per sale jump is super useful
[2:54:55] Thrath: So the process is working really good
[2:57:16] Madam_Orange: once you get to the like $120 range, can start just making 5 or so batches of it while experimenting with the other stills kivaSus

[4:40:42] uitzui: if they all end up being equal you can still test HI mZ and mQ for 4th
[4:42:44] lblvckmvgicl: VD best one Prayge
[4:43:30] Anrisacia: Odd kivaSus
[4:44:17] uitzui: impossibru Sadge
[4:45:35] Thrath: Yeah its possible you have a dupe
[4:45:38] uitzui: yeah
[4:46:44] zeman94: Could be a duplicate letter
[4:46:46] uitzui: but you can also try to pick one of the results from this turn and just run 7 batches with a 5th number
[4:46:55] uitzui: and hope you go up and refine from there
[4:46:55] Thrath: ^
[4:48:22] Madam_Orange: could try each of the 3 in that slot of just try and find a 5th kivaSus
[4:48:38] uitzui: yeah that is an option too
[4:48:53] Madam_Orange: or even just move one like, mQ all around to see where it is best kivaSus
[4:49:07] uitzui: like do 3 cooks, HI, mZ, mQ for 4th slot and just to testers for 5th with the other stills because you have to do that anyway
[4:49:13] zeman94: Or do 3 batches with the duplicates and 4 others
[4:49:34] Madam_Orange: ye
[4:49:39] Anrisacia: I would say testing for the chance of a duplicate in the 4th slot at least exhausts all options there before moving anywhere else
[4:49:40] uitzui: because then you will have completed all 10 for 4th and already collected data for 5th
[4:49:54] inus2: yeah would definitely try the duplicates first since that can be done in a single run
[4:54:11] uitzui: better info than expected at least
[4:55:25] uitzui: ye i think this is fine
[4:55:33] Anrisacia: NODDERS still on the right track
[4:55:37] uitzui: honestly if you had the ability to sustain 10 stills would be optimal for this
[4:55:49] uitzui: but that is too much for one gatherer
[4:56:10] Thrath: As long as they continue to pump out at average its still going in the right direction
[4:56:19] uitzui: ye
[4:57:12] squoogelol: could just slot 3 gamba
[4:57:26] Thrath: In theory the next big jump could just come from the 5th slot and it means that positions need to be looked out but thats not too bad to figure out
[4:57:34] uitzui: that you can only start doing once you have established your highest with all 5 slots, which is why you should test all 10 possibilites for every slot regardless
[4:57:55] Madam_Orange: shine made today so far by andi is worth ~$500 more than what she made yesterday
[4:58:03] Madam_Orange: like total
[4:58:18] inus2: yeh what zui said is what I was thinking, need to test 4th and 5th before tweaking 3rd if 3rd is wrong
[4:58:37] inus2: either way testing 5th should increase the count and give the data to fix 3rd if it is wrong
[4:58:45] Madam_Orange: its been like half the time tho kivaLUL
[4:59:12] Anrisacia: EZY Clap doubling production
[4:59:18] zeman94: Well if you have 7 stills couldn't you do both plans?
[4:59:36] wizardiis: NODDERS
[4:59:49] zeman94: Use 3 for duplications and 4 to run the other ideas
[4:59:50] Anrisacia: Just gotta keep to the method NODDERS

[5:00:55] Anrisacia: It will be easier to keep track of to keep them separate

[5:04:35] Madam_Orange: his game keeps crashing too
[5:04:37] uitzui: if you have so much excess you could buy 3 more stills just to do all 10 possibilities for 5th slot in one go
[5:04:43] Madam_Orange: having a rough go of it
[5:04:49] uitzui: you will need them anyway and it would make testing really clean
[5:05:27] uitzui: before tax yep
[5:05:27] Thrath: before tax yeah
[5:05:35] Madam_Orange: 1400 with tax iirc

[6:13:27] uitzui: yeah you won't get stuck anyway
[6:14:12] Thrath: NODDERS
[6:14:12] Steambottom: do we know what the high quality prices look like?
[6:14:18] uitzui: yeah
[6:14:35] Madam_Orange: NODDERS and then you can go back and try different 4th or change the 3rd for science
[6:15:06] Thrath: I think you can get it done today
[6:15:27] Anrisacia: Yeah you would just do one run with one option for 4th slot and all 10 options for 5th, then another run for the second option for slot 4 and all 10 options for 5th NODDERS
[6:15:41] Madam_Orange: its just a matter of how fast kermy can run the next 10 tbh kivaLUL

[6:26:22] Anrisacia: Well it's not terrible. Means only two options for 4th
[6:26:27] Madam_Orange: ok ok
[6:26:38] Madam_Orange: so which one gonna use for 4?
[6:26:49] Madam_Orange: Huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
[6:27:03] Phenomenem: kivaNotes
[6:27:39] uitzui: maybe yeah

[6:28:03] Madam_Orange: just gotta pick one NODDERS
[6:28:09] Anrisacia: NODDERS very possible that with Hu it was really good in 4th but god awful in a couple others

[6:33:22] uitzui: maybe HI is so solid it occupies 1st and 5th
[6:33:51] zeman94: So if this give you $130 you won't have to do the next 10 right or will you anyways to fill the sheet?
[6:34:05] Madam_Orange: could have kermy test the duplicates last kivaSus
[6:34:23] uitzui: if she hits 130 she is done
[6:34:48] Madam_Orange: the rumors are the max is like 135-140 iirc
[6:34:52] uitzui: but it's sort of unlikely that she jumps from 105 to 130 with just this slot, but hopefully there will be a big jump with one of them
[6:35:13] Thrath: Yeah at max this should jump to a max of 120 if lucky
[6:35:22] Madam_Orange: NODDERS
[6:35:39] Thrath: Well range of 115-120
[6:35:46] uitzui: but even then fine tuning will already make so much money that whatever she produces during the last part of the process will be super valuable
[6:35:58] Thrath: Exactly NODDERS

[8:29:17] wizardiis: kivaDed
[8:29:20] uitzui: i also think while that generally is true none of the cop crim pairs have a woman in a crim leadership position and just Andi being Andi Jones i could already see her catching so much shit for being with a cop IC and OOC probably
[8:29:41] yungVDD: I like seeing relationship RP but the people it does bring are some of the worst
[8:30:37] Jeycoil: the shenanigans are more important NODDERS
[8:30:44] Madam_Orange: i just like characters having close relationships, whether romantic or not
[8:30:50] Conasht: characters getting to know each other is always fun to watch
[8:31:09] inus2: It was great on some povs at start of 4.0 cause it was pretty much the only non-grinding rp going on for a while kivaLUL
[8:31:22] Madam_Orange: @Conasht characters getting to know each other is v fun to watch NODDERS
[8:31:47] uitzui: i have a question actually, what would happen to Andi and Yaegar if Andis scorched earth moment with the guild happens
[8:32:22] Conasht: I also love Andi talks with different characters so anything that gives more of that I look forward to no matter where it leads
[8:32:54] uitzui: that would be really interesting true, but idk if that wouldn't lead to the same people reactions and blame her for whatever you know

[8:43:04] zeman94: So hi in the last spot falls between rb and the other one
[8:44:12] Madam_Orange: yeah
[8:44:15] uitzui: ye probably
[8:44:37] uitzui: kinda have to wait for the end of the testing round
[8:45:15] zeman94: And mq can't be first or second because of hi and wz
[8:45:37] uitzui: its possible
[8:45:40] Madam_Orange: yeah
[8:45:41] Anrisacia: Good question
[8:45:50] Madam_Orange: and then you could try switching mQ out after that
[8:46:06] uitzui: you could technically cook that one right now
[8:46:29] uitzui: moar data kivaCheer
[8:47:29] uitzui: i never quite got why you started to doubt mQ so much more than hi and mz
[8:47:45] Madam_Orange: cause mQ was never cycled through
[8:47:46] uitzui: because mq was super solid from the beginning and hi had a crazy price jump
[8:47:47] zeman94: So hi wz and mq are correct it's just the last two slots
[8:47:52] Madam_Orange: ye
[8:47:56] uitzui: so if anything in my mind mz was the weakest of the first 3
[8:48:02] Thrath: Yeah purely because mQ was just a control element
[8:48:48] uitzui: *wz yeah
[8:49:47] uitzui: Nicooo Kantoo kivaCheer
[8:49:48] Madam_Orange: but the only things not tested in place of wZ are HI and mQ zui
[8:49:58] uitzui: true
[8:50:34] uitzui: but my point still stands that doubles are possible so it could end up Hi Hi mQ
[8:50:44] Madam_Orange: tried everything for the 4th slot
[8:50:56] uitzui: and wZ was just strong enough to make it average
[8:51:22] Thrath: Yeah I still have a feeling its possible that a dupe is gonna be in the end recipe
[8:51:27] Madam_Orange: tried all the below average for the 1st slot, tried all but HI and mQ for slot 2, only tried mQ for slot 3
[8:51:29] uitzui: but i think that is a theory that should be explored once the data from this testing + the extra batch is in
[8:51:43] lblvckmvgicl: ive kinda been in and out of stream but has the idea of having multiple of the same one in the equation been tested ?
