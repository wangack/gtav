[1:43:49] DeviousBOT: yous
[1:43:56] DeviousBOT: KEKW
[1:43:56] Louwi_: moonshine is just making some low % alcohol and distilling it
[1:44:00] truni__: its a chemical reaction where yeast or bacteria react with the sugars in the other ingredients to produce ethanol (the alcohol in the drink) and carbon dioxide
[1:44:23] Takima80: beer gets more yeast and hops while wine gets more sugar.. the stronger the alcohol content the more sugar you want

[3:03:52] RandyC4: what are the actual approved colors cuz if those are the ONLY ones that bullshit

[3:03:53] deadeyedarrell: that's wild you weren't aware of that on signing tbh
[3:03:54] Zenotetsuken: @Dtakul The HOA is basically a collective agency that owns the land that all of the houses are on
[3:03:54] IIDeSyncII: i would have a restraining order agianst HOA
[3:03:54] DickyBird1912: @FL_Hockey house prices always go up thats a bs argument for a hoa to exist
[3:03:58] marczm4n: yeah that‚Äôs understandable
[3:03:58] xxteeko: tell them to fine you and then tell them to get bent

[3:04:24] Kevo313131: if you want that mf highlighter yellow you should be able to do it
[3:04:29] pheaturelol: now just wait til you have to deal with Mr. Karen and his in game HOA ur gonna have a real blast
[3:04:33] Dtakul: but if u buy the house "the land" under the house and few m around it belongs to u as well no?
[3:04:37] Uf0s8mycat: this is why i got out of HOA when I moved LUL got sick of paying people to restrict my house
[3:04:42] GETAFlX: @Shotz i cant believe u would disrespect your community by getting the wrong shade of grey like that man its disgusting tbh
[3:04:44] A_Mad_Boar: Is there a way you can separate from the HOA?

[5:36:27] LywoodTy: @bryanwrightguy facts
[5:36:28] FatGirlDrunk: The concerning part of convo ... "Even if she is a snitch, I cant just turn on someone I have history with" basically saying he condones snitching and possibly is one since "everyone does it"

[5:36:38] Palsie: @Nzlaten Ahh okok i gotchu i didnt know all the history with Flip and Vin
[5:37:05] bryanwrightguy: Vinny "petty" Pistone.. new title..
[5:37:06] itzalfie01: what flippy said about that situation of oh I‚Äôve never had a problem with her, that basically means that cg should‚Äôve said no when they asked cg for help with the Simone shit, can be said both ways, vinny just saw where loyalty lies
[5:37:10] shweebee: shotzLw shotzLw
[5:37:10] novawingz: snitching lost all meaning because many people including cg do it so making a big deal out of it kinda hypocritical
