[1:35:22] Ryaht: most of the officers is handcuffed, why would the crims respect them at all then
[1:35:23] eeDrix: exactly what I was gonna say
[1:35:25] Fabushki: the people not respecting the PD is not because cops are soft, its because theres no consequences, no one gets perma'd or jailed for days for doing heavy crimes
[1:35:37] benjasi1: well, unfortunately not. It seems like it's just cops vs crims
[1:35:37] TheLadyCupcake: need noise pollution charges for snr buns NODDERS
[1:35:38] woahdudewhat: SlapAHomie
[1:35:41] merger3: a lot of crims want it to be regular GTA with really good NPC
[1:35:45] eeDrix: the rp nerds get crazy mad cos someone playing as a civ “snitches”
[1:35:54] wavy__________________: except for the one streamer that snitches on everyone
[1:35:54] Neekapkilla: Hell andrews said he doesn't even want to stream because people come in and talk shit if he polices the wrong person
[1:35:56] KnightyGaming: Snr Buns a SHITSHOW
[1:35:57] coatzul: moon2Y Yung snitch
[1:35:57] ArdentCause: adam working snr buns lmfaoooo
[1:35:57] Smypher: uh oh it's Adak
[1:35:58] Arza_: When Nick was robbed cops came and asked him "what did you do? you must have done something to deserve that"
[1:35:59] krenblaylock: protected? but isn't part of the entertainment is making sure that people don't exactly feel protected?
[1:36:05] AWPhobic: long jail never work on nopixel, it always end on hell week
[1:36:07] Gachiguru: Kapp 󠀀
[1:36:10] ArdentCause: doctor and cashier
[1:36:11] Seinfelduh: @Arza_ BASED cops
[1:36:12] detoksi: you get fired from the civ jobs if you do felonies so there is consequienses
[1:36:14] ShowHatez: the majority is grinders
[1:36:15] Rennat47: Pokes pilots
[1:36:16] aCaptainPotato: ~3 days jails wouldnt be that bad I think?
[1:36:16] Bright_san: civilian life
[1:36:20] arva__: hard to balance against grind people that almost not rp at all
[1:36:20] gHEEg: npcs?
[1:36:22] oscar_n_t: well, theyre all j walkers so..
[1:36:25] DezalbM: lol in your eyes maybe
[1:36:25] pickles010: you should rp as a civ to broaden your horizon and get a new perpective
[1:36:25] kingkoolkattz: @SleiFever shareX is the exception not the rule, they're trying to remove away from using clips for evidence, local recordings is also iffy but that was used for the Vivek and Bobby case, its a little wishy washy but def 100% moving away from using clips as body cam evidence
[1:36:31] steven_even853: I wouldn’t go that far, it’s probably 30% civs
[1:36:33] sevenevilmuffins: the crims tend to treat it likes them vs us instead of them playing a certain role
[1:36:34] Aaron__CS: COP STACKING docSmash
[1:36:34] KYslippy: is there a three strikes law in los santos? delete character after too much shit
[1:36:34] cynvaldo: lmao just get 1 dude to stay guard 24/7 lol hahaha
[1:36:35] Valagore: if all you see are crimes and cops, thats all you are watching..
[1:36:37] krenblaylock: fair point
[1:36:38] svan223: shit will change when there will be 20 cops
[1:36:44] OminousEinherjar: @eeDrix Yeah, it's so dumb when a CIV informs the police, people call it "snitching".
[1:36:48] JustinBeaver_: @acaptainpotato ppl would quit playing
[1:36:51] Xen_Crypt: its not like a utopia being fully safe, but doesnt need to be lawless wild west either
[1:36:54] TheLastRace: Prison has some good chanes for RP if there were people "stuck in there" but I get not wanting to force people in there for too long
[1:36:56] jinnytolls: Dr, EMS, Restaurant, G6, Mechanic, Garbage, Taxi Driver, Tow Truck Driver, Lumber and Hunter are all Civ jobs
[1:37:00] xCheekz: the problem is shitlords dont know how to do anything else but shitlord
[1:37:01] Scrando: if civs always feel unsafe and can’t do their jobs that’s not fun
[1:37:03] hamslice5: 100%
[1:37:03] LOW___________: anything that "slows ur content" someones gonna bitch about
[1:37:05] redeyeisac23: needs to be jail time like Leo was jailed lol
[1:37:06] greedybuglord: are you riding with any one?
[1:37:07] jonfett: crims are going as hardcore as the mechanics allow right now. Cops are nerfed by the PD culture
[1:37:08] evilmoose__: Wasnt she trying to tell you in RP that its going beyond the acceptable levels and no one is doing amything.
[1:37:09] MysticCasey: Everything is still setting up for the long game right now
[1:37:09] PWRslide2: random chaos can be good, just can't always be against the same people
[1:37:09] Mistrfeelgood: people think that's only crims and cops because that's all they watch
[1:37:10] steven_even853: if a civilian asks the police for help, it’s your responsibility yo take care of the issue
[1:37:12] iwannanuhh: I feel like if you watch a cop role player you will most likely think everyone is a crim.... because they literally focus on catching crims haha
[1:37:12] JonTheYeti: @EsfandTV ride with den plzzzzz
[1:37:15] layziep: This really is an ecosystem of its own. Hard to keep it balanced I imagine.
[1:37:16] stekie: I think opening another eating place is a good start. Having only one place for food where everyone has to go to is always going to cause issues
[1:37:16] younghof27: just put 300 cops at SNR buns
[1:37:17] HyperPerky: Much cops so you could play ali KEKW
[1:37:18] Verion: cop stacking Madge
[1:37:19] sheepexpert: 6 cops at snr Classic

[4:33:17] MisterParry: It's very likely Peanut's, but it would need to be confirmed
[4:33:18] Kekema: normal to take him in to test
[4:33:19] Thraxton1: yeah but it has to be proven to a court, otherwise it's just Kit's word that noone else touched it

[5:50:16] guilt_: To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand WeeWee. His communication style is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical RPer's head. There's also WeeWee's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance.

[10:46:27] icecubedude_: just have everyone whisper in there so everyones not talking over each other?
[10:46:28] Zolothan: this conversation is torture

[10:47:09] Happyface615: Why's that dishwasher got on a yellow shirt and talking in the lobby? KKona
[10:47:12] cuspeli: its literally just too small, make the food lobby like 4x as large and you can run 3 registers & make the food prep area 2x as large EZ
[10:47:14] Duval904jax: @Zolothan its turning into a feedback loop

[11:08:02] Winston_Moriarty: @EsfandTV he abused the management system to fire people, this is a little beyond rp
[11:08:02] SweeneysWeenies: theyre both right i guess. but hes going into the back when hes not working and causing a disturbance she saiid on call i think

[12:14:50] Utschig: In an unexpected turn, batons prove more hazardous than guns due to their deceptive versatility. With an uncanny ability to transform into unpredictable forms mid-swing, batons become unpredictable and harder to control. Meanwhile, guns, with their straightforward projectiles, provide a more predictable and manageable means of self-defense.

[12:29:52] geckoguy69: @EsfandTV Your stream IS washed out. When you first set up your OLED you changed the Gamma & NVIDIA settings. Compare your stream to other streamers. Chat is super low IQ and doesn't know what it's talking about when it says it's "fine". Take like 20 minutes to fix it, ask other streamers
