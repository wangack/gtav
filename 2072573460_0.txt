[5:59:40] USMCSapper: With what you spend on delivery food have you thought about a private chef? They will buy the groceries come to your house and cook the meals for a week for roughly the same or less than what you pay for a week of dash food @timmac
[5:59:44] ccoolracer128: you bread is up top
[5:59:51] ccoolracer128: your*
[6:00:22] Kkaedal: once a week, cook for the week

[6:00:44] USMCSapper: Once a week stock your fridge pre portioned meals
[6:01:07] Kkaedal: that shit would be nice
[6:01:30] JenAndGame: @USMCSapper Will they do two meals for the week? Like a breakfast and diner?
[6:01:45] Kkaedal: I have a weird thing, I am never hungry, I just feel weak if I forget to eat
[6:01:54] grimyoulater: eat bread
[6:01:54] Lepaca: time slows down when you're waiting for food, it's an universal law

[6:02:30] JenAndGame: @Kkaedal That's fine, I wake late hah. Do you have the name of a company or two I could look into?
[6:02:37] fiction12211: 53 water damn
[6:02:55] JenAndGame: Amount of meals in the day, I assume
[6:03:01] USMCSapper: Meals per day @timmac
[6:03:02] Kkaedal: @JenAndGame I am in France, so no idea about america
[6:03:10] JenAndGame: Like a week of lunch and a week of dinner
[6:03:15] Kkaedal: should say US* mb
[6:03:15] JenAndGame: Or only a week of diner
[6:03:29] JenAndGame: @Kkaedal Damn EU doing better things dizzyAngry
[6:04:12] JenAndGame: @Kkaedal Transportation, gas, and groceries are SUPER expensive right now. I imagine it's a lot more costly for a person here than in France
[6:04:37] Kkaedal: @JenAndGame Oh I don't have that for myself it's just a service I looked into a bit to see the cost and if it was worth it but it's only worth if you have extra income or only order food
[6:04:59] JenAndGame: @Kkaedal <- bad ordering food habit
[6:05:16] Kkaedal: @JenAndGame Depends on the state in US and I live near Paris so it's not cheap but it's OK
[6:05:56] JenAndGame: @Kkaedal I'm just outside NYC (:
[6:06:05] JenAndGame: @Kkaedal $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
[6:06:40] Kkaedal: NYC is so stupid, went there once as a kid it was already stupid expensive
[6:06:48] JenAndGame: When I travel, "Wooow this is so cheap!"
[6:07:05] Kkaedal: The best thing in france is mostly the free healthcare

[6:07:21] JenAndGame: @Kkaedal I found the trick to living 35-40 mins outside it by train I can walk to in a good area. That helps
[6:07:29] JenAndGame: @Kkaedal I can only dream
[6:07:44] KingJester: Gomer becoming one with the sewers now?
[6:07:47] Kkaedal: I think you guys have way cheaper gas but we have way better public transport
[6:08:06] JenAndGame: @JenAndGame Still pricey, NY pricey, but not NYC pricey where I'm living
[6:08:20] JenAndGame: Even where we're not sprawled, most of our public trans sucks
[6:08:53] curt_macklin: Has Gomer talked to Tuggz about shine?
[6:09:07] Kkaedal: I mean in big cities, like I can get to anywhere in France in about 5/6hours by train and it's pretty cheap and they often offer deals for certain cities week to week
[6:09:08] KingJester: Public transport is almost non-existent where I am
[6:09:16] Ord1125: Dang...i literally went and took a 4 hour nap....when you were still in here...and i come back and you still here lol
[6:09:48] mackbo1an: was afk for a bit. did you check your rep recently? just curious
[6:09:52] JenAndGame: @Kkaedal So it's whatev about expensive gas if you're not using it often.
[6:09:59] Ord1125: oh i  know for sure...the grind is real
[6:10:23] USMCSapper: @kkaedal  we have some places where a 5-6 mile drive to just get groceries let alone mcdonalds
[6:10:39] Kkaedal: @JenAndGame Yeah I don't drive, public transport is OP
[6:10:51] JenAndGame: @USMCSapper I hate those places during roadtrips lol
[6:11:07] Ord1125: i mean anything you do in the city no matter what job/activity you do is going to take time/energy  but your right if you can remove the middle man for this the payoff is greater
[6:11:12] wheeziie: Public transport in the states is just ass. I wish we had better trains.
[6:11:16] JenAndGame: @Kkaedal I don't either because of strategizing where I'm living lol
[6:11:16] Kkaedal: @USMCSapper Same in the countryside
[6:11:18] USMCSapper: 5-6 hour drive not mile
[6:11:31] wheeziie: If we had better trains. I would travel more often
[6:11:43] mackbo1an: i was gonna say 5-6 miles isnt very far lol
[6:11:52] Raylorb: @xJOKURv TY for the sub a while ago
[6:12:07] Kkaedal: @JenAndGame My Uni has a train stop attached to it and I live a stop away and 15mins away from Paris

[6:12:42] JenAndGame: @Kkaedal Always about location, location, location.
[6:13:04] JenAndGame: Are there rare or really good items occasionally?
[6:13:18] Kkaedal: @wheeziie You guys actually have a bunch a rail systems in place but they are for goods and are privatized
[6:13:54] JenAndGame: @Kkaedal They're not too good. Lots of derailments. But, they also demonstrate what the priorities are here
[6:14:12] wheeziie: @Kkaedal We do have public trains. But their old and slow. I wanted to go to a few states south. And its a 15 hour train ride.
[6:14:21] Lordbidwell: Alot of people
[6:14:41] JenAndGame: @wheeziie Ye, I know we do. They just suck or are non existent in many places.
[6:15:01] Kkaedal: @wheeziie When you look up best railroad infrastructure in the world, the US is above France
[6:15:02] Lordbidwell: That was today for me
[6:15:03] wheeziie: @JenAndGame Very slow and bad. LUL
[6:15:21] USMCSapper: I have a friend in alaska who has a 3-4 hour flight to go buy food
[6:15:28] JenAndGame: @Kkaedal That's not a good thing Kkaedal LOL
[6:15:39] ElGenki: fast food coupons are important
[6:15:46] Rambler: timmacRC
[6:15:47] wheeziie: @Kkaedal LUL I'm shocked at that. We have old slow trains. We don't have fast transports like Japan.
[6:16:13] Kkaedal: But since ours is state owned, they regulate and make it so almost everyone can use it
[6:16:13] JenAndGame: @wheeziie I've used them in Japan. So pleasant and calming
[6:16:43] wheeziie: @JenAndGame Sadge I havent been. But I people talk very highly of them.
[6:16:58] Kkaedal: @wheeziie Biggest railroad system in the world covering 250000km but only 35000km of it is for passengers LUL

[6:17:41] JenAndGame: @JenAndGame I've also done the Tokyo rush hour subway. It was just like NYC fidi rush hour subways,but better tech. Crowds didn't both me, it's the same here.
[6:18:17] JenAndGame: @JenAndGame *bother
[6:18:26] wheeziie: @Kkaedal Its ass. I hate flying. Only because of how early you got to get to the airport to get somewhere. If we had fast trains. It would be fun to travel somewhere and come back that night. After checking things out.
[6:18:30] USMCSapper: @jenandgame  a
[6:18:42] JenAndGame: @wheeziie Tokyo was a cleaner NYC with less varied culture. It was fun, but it was too similar for me. I adored Kyoto
[6:18:52] USMCSapper: @jenandgame  faster, cleaner and more orginised
[6:19:07] JenAndGame: @USMCSapper mhm
[6:19:14] Kkaedal: @JenAndGame No crackheads is a plus
[6:19:33] JenAndGame: @USMCSapper Though NY has unwritten organized rules. Tourists just ruin it dizzyKek
[6:19:58] USMCSapper: @jenandgame i was stationed in japan for 3 years in the late 80's
[6:20:04] wheeziie: @JenAndGame Japan>us. lol When it comes to keeping their streets clean. I love the small restaurants. Where you can barely sit and eat. Its so fascinating to me.
[6:20:05] JenAndGame: @Kkaedal Mostly mentally ill as opposed to addicts now. And just no housing people because shortage + expense
[6:20:22] Bakemaan: gomer is gonna be the rat king by the end of the day
[6:20:23] duckhunter_88: how are you doing
[6:20:39] JenAndGame: @wheeziie Depends where you are in the US. The bougie town I'm on the border of if is incredibly clean
[6:21:10] Kkaedal: @wheeziie In France, we are know for the "TGV", high speed trains, like 3h train ride and I get to the south coast while it's 500 miles away
[6:21:13] wheeziie: @JenAndGame I'm in Indiana. Its pretty clean. Indy is hit and miss.
[6:21:29] USMCSapper: Easiest way to meet girls was to act lost in the subway in tokyo everyone wanted to practice english or had white fever
[6:21:34] wheeziie: @Kkaedal That would be sick.
[6:21:41] JenAndGame: @wheeziie Indiana was redneck barf land when I would visit. Border of Kentucky, I forget the area name
[6:22:07] JenAndGame: @USMCSapper Indifferent when I went LOL

[6:23:40] wheeziie: @JenAndGame Oh cool. I never wanted to go. LUL I have family that wants to go. But I'm good.
[6:23:46] ccoolracer128: you are almost maxed weight
[6:23:57] Kkaedal: And I just checked it's only 29‚Ç¨ with a good deal, so 3 hours and 29‚Ç¨ later, I am in Marseille
[6:24:04] JenAndGame: @wheeziie Never do the tourist shit. You need a local friend for a really good time.
[6:24:35] JenAndGame: @wheeziie Locals fucking hate Times Square and avoid it
[6:24:38] NoahS116: you found something in  10/20 searches. just kept track
[6:24:59] wheeziie: @JenAndGame Yeah, not surprising to me. I enjoyed Chicago when my wives uncle worked there. He showed us around. But I have no interest going back without him there. And he no longer works there.
[6:25:02] NoahS116: so you‚Äôre at about a 50% chance to loot it looks like as of now
[6:25:18] JenAndGame: @wheeziie Maybe a friend will end up there

[6:27:41] wheeziie: LUL
[6:27:46] JenAndGame: @Kkaedal Did the Turkey cabs scam and overcharge you? I saw a livestream and ooof
[6:28:01] JenAndGame: @wheeziie Most locals also fucking hate it Lol
[6:28:33] IndeSyCiv: one mans garbage is an other mans treasure eh
[6:28:38] Kkaedal: I used their transport system since I did a lot of visiting and historical sites usually have a station
[6:28:44] wheeziie: @JenAndGame It's always full of people trying to take advantage of tourist. And thats just not fun.
[6:28:52] JenAndGame: LA friends are in the surrounding areas of LA to have a great time. They avoid inner LA
[6:29:15] JenAndGame: @wheeziie Friends say the same and also, "ugh" haha
[6:29:45] JenAndGame: @Kkaedal Smart. The cabs were so, so, so bad when I watched Autumn and Garrett livestream it
[6:29:58] xJOKURv: someone took tacos pawn shop lol
[6:30:06] Kkaedal: Like I visited a historical museum on the golden age of Muslim advancements in science and technology, it was great, I went twice, second time without my family because they didn't care

[6:33:47] ZeeMacNA: lol
[6:33:51] Kkaedal: My bad, I only saw the memes on white people being shown as black
[6:33:57] Rambler: @JenAndGame afaik its overcompensating based on the datasets being mostly white people so it artificially inflates the chance of other races, but it does so without knowing the context of the question
[6:33:58] JenAndGame: @USMCSapper I'm thinking they sourced wide and white is a very low percentage out there
[6:34:18] JenAndGame: @Rambler Do we know this to be true?
[6:34:23] Kkaedal: They generate multiple images, they can mix and have every race but they didn't
[6:34:30] USMCSapper: @jenandgame  the non white nazi was funny
[6:34:32] HoBoHiPpY2014: been using ai for art for last 4 years it wasn't best out there just the newest and on hype train

[6:35:56] JenAndGame: Tim, everyone sounds louder than you do. Idk if it's just me, and they're all cool, but I'm here for Gomer.
[6:36:17] Kkaedal: they had like a text saying they can't generate people based on race for white then it was ok for the rest
