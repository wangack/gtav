[3:33:32] Corvollo: So what you're saying is we need to bug Delaser to make a AI enabled bot that scans video content for your username and pings the discord whenever you're found?
[3:33:34] Devaleth: Ivan casually dropping like 60k in mats
[3:33:42] fraij: I only watch high rank valorant people, so that i could learn PepeLaugh
[3:33:52] deathyzz07: can't you buy 3 at the same time ?

[3:35:24] Bunnyfufu: says someone in that rank
[3:35:24] Xerthevia: The issue with silver is you have the people that dont learn movement but spent a ton of time thinking its their aim so they spend their time in aimlabs
[3:35:25] Fr0stwav3: Awkward but what if the people you match with are getting matched with people with throw
[3:35:26] ben0809: mhm
[3:35:33] Corvollo: It's like you can fight an assassin 1v1 all day, but fighting a 1v500 is impossible.
[3:35:37] Xerthevia: so they become godtier at aiming but dogshit overall so get stuck
[3:35:55] Xerthevia: Also I AM THE Yoru

[3:36:29] Xerthevia: I'll even battle sage Madge
[3:36:41] Fr0stwav3: so you're saying you need to just have a team to play with to rank out of elo hell nodd
[3:36:50] PatrickMaybe: @vatinius peeeetah remember the time I was a unit of measuring data?
[3:36:58] vividimaginations: As a League player I've heard people say that same thing for over a decade.
