[9:27:47] MontyGue: Makes sense
[9:27:52] Tandyman: Need NPCs to assassinate
[9:27:55] Glancing: I feel like thats down to the players themselves, but thats something hard to enforce unfortunately
[9:27:56] doctor420g: Yeah, it'd be like the repetitive singleplayer missions
[9:27:58] Riuzaku: Isn't boba the Jhon Wick of the server?

[9:29:45] RedtwoSB: go full MMO and have a quest asking for 20 oxy or something else for the grinders LUL
[9:29:56] Bigfredstallbeer: it would get overwhelmed with RDM. there'd be too many hits placed on people. it'd have to be an event sort of thing I guess.
[9:29:58] eiightbiitt: what about a grinder hit? Kappa
[9:30:00] doctor420g: Get the trash out the car DansGame
[9:30:01] wondervviener: KEKW
