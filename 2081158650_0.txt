[1:11:26] luzkenin: obsidian is great
[1:11:27] ImStuckInATreeDud: bg3 forgotten  Aware
[1:11:30] whimzyyyy: need to learn markdown
[1:11:33] KenThirteen: to start just use it like a normal notepad. The power comes from the ability to link notes to other notes
[1:11:34] widbar: It's great for creating links between topics, but there's a bit of learning curve
[1:11:35] slight621: What about using Notion with opacity set to like 10-15%?
[1:11:35] SquarePirate: just start typing and learn some markdown
[1:11:42] ExpectDragons: have you tried writing notes on a tablet?
[1:11:43] Stuart_Lethal: @Tera I bet they just want NoPixel to be open for everyone which would be a got dam shitshow

[1:11:59] SammytheQueen: google docs auto saves
[1:12:01] SavageTarzan: xdd I get that, but you gotta stop giving us dates and then not play
[1:12:02] KenThirteen: Imagine that you have one master compendium for your investigations and that links to individual cases. That's what obsidian can do
[1:12:03] OhMahGlee: any other hotmic povs?

[1:12:55] dolbyac3: Obsidian is great sine it uses markdown. I like it alot for taking notes at work.
[1:12:55] theshaolinpanda: PURGE WEEK
[1:12:58] taffletv: @EsfandTV steam notes can also be pinned to the screen so if you need to rememebr stuff its there

[1:13:56] RebornOffline: Hope he gets back to PD later
[1:13:56] widbar: @CarePhilNow i think it's different philosphy. With obsidian you just start taking notes and just search for it.

[1:14:19] PlummyOW: Wait who quit?
[1:14:20] danbelow: Obsidian automatically saves. And it helps organizing the notes. Because the in program structure reflects the folder structure and you don't need to think about it. Don't need markdown for basic use.
[1:14:20] WineNot: he was he was looking for a way out

[1:20:49] dapyman: Ruth comes back and takes over the prison from Bobby & Carmine could be a good arc

[3:29:31] FaramirRat: @Vikairius if the majority of cops from all the shifts had their own personal vehicle then that wouldn't be that hard to do for the captains.

[3:30:32] NilfgaardianSlave: @Filthypickle then the server dies
[3:30:39] FaramirRat: @Vikairius ya that is what the shared vehicles should be for and only for, new hires, every cops first duty should be saving for their own car.

[4:26:37] blastingbubba: When is the state going to start repoing vehicles used in crimes?
[4:26:38] droksid00: @Bigdan2140 its clearly a bug that a repair kit flips a car. exploiting a bug is power gaming. room temperature iq.
[4:26:39] TheNotoriousKEV: @EsfandTV def worth the try
[4:26:40] manfredalfredgernot: is reckless evading a violent felony chat?

[4:26:43] docterstrange_: whose dna was it
[4:26:45] wavy__________________: dang
[4:26:45] dazer0h: cuz your stack of 5 stayed
[4:26:49] mikelowery29: don‚Äôt know how any crimes would complain about pd vehicles.  Maybe you‚Äôre getting unlucky and getting dale Earnhardt ancestors drivers, but the speed and turning of the crim vehicles is insane. @EsfandTV
[4:26:50] cabelgurung: maybe repair kit thrower threw a clean kit
[4:26:51] LostAndConfused304: Why would u want the hamburgers dna
[4:26:52] 42arc: it's cow dna
[4:26:52] furious_Trance: could that be intentional RNG?
[4:26:52] JoshDaDad: the water DNA is legit tho
[4:26:55] Joongi_: @splooshtasticals I mean, in game, last time up north was the same, she got pulled and they were instantly surrounded by some vans going around and stuff LULW
[4:26:55] Rastafiki: i think its because you had 1 more repair kit on you when you grabbed it. you threw the stack of 5 but still had one more on you.
[4:26:56] papap00h: Yall crazy in here
[4:26:56] Sairaph117: It was still pretty hilarious (and frustrating) your ass got flipped.
[4:26:57] DavidKO9932: That's somewhat realistic, even if it's a bug.
[4:26:57] Wintyer2: did mings car still have the Turbo in it
[4:27:00] Smoogol: maybe it keeps the one with the highest/lowest durability
[4:27:02] Janman88: would interesting when it keeps it and when its loosing it
[4:27:04] MagicTheHydrated: @droksid00 you care more than the person whos car got flipped
[4:27:04] DannyL3tscher: prolly copies the properties of the one with less durability when it merges
[4:27:04] Bigdan2140: @Usahi_Light Throwing shit at a car to damage it is not power gaming it doesnt 100% flip a car every time
[4:27:09] Toastedgamer03: @EsfandTV i think it is because one repair kit had no dna and the second one with dna merged with the first one overwriting it with no dna
[4:27:10] Exotic_Soul: unlucky
[4:27:10] Rastafiki: YEP
[4:27:11] Beep_Cx: Sadge

[4:27:54] SgtNoRespect: @Nagini_Rowle_ you are hands down the dumbest person to ever walk this earth, I hope you fall on your neck going to school you little twink bitch
[4:27:54] Usahi_Light: @Bigdan2140 Correct, throwing shit at a car normally doesnt cause damage. The point is that the repair kit has a buggy collision thing on it and shouldn't have it. No other items besides rocks do that and the kit is worse which is why if it was intentional, it's powergaming. Its' a bug.
[4:27:54] manfredalfredgernot: is reckless evading a violent felony?
[4:27:55] MagicTheHydrated: @droksid00 you're right, sorry i assumed

[4:28:36] mercs99: Even if it's not power gaming its in bad taste because it will just become the "meta" and make every chase dumb as shit until the devs step in and change it and then nobody gets to have fun with rocks in harmless situations.
[4:28:36] Ross_McD: @lostandconfused304 Someone asked who new chief is. It is a character named Beric Johnson
[4:28:36] Bigdan2140: @Usahi_Light It has always caused damage though its certain things which is why they threw a bunch of random shit to see what would work. This chat spams power gaming anytime cops struggle its crazy

[4:41:38] Icestruggler: Gamba: Will the Burger end up in the Evidence locker or someones Tummy by the end of the day?
[4:41:39] IllusiOGnarly: you could fit a crafting table in that ghost room behid womens showers that you found during the haunting
[4:41:40] catfish_quackenbush: @docshaayy i mean from an RP thing this is a big hit, it would also unlock meta for crims to stop throwing shit out at cops
[4:41:41] Tortoise88: WHAT IS THAT?!

[4:42:18] argemvrgames: argemvrgames subscribed with Prime. 
[4:42:22] splooshtasticals: @splooshtasticals but the thing is people use personal & local cars. Recurring turbo abusers should never have privilegeds of having it. That's why i'd rather wait & see wat they cook up.
[4:42:26] Mickow94: I don't like the idea that the police and everyone doing everything themselves, kinda cringe imo
[4:42:41] choom_69: Holy, does Esfand sleep? I watch him RP when I go to sleep, and he is RPing when I wake up (not that im complaining) lmao
[4:42:42] docshaayy: @catfish_quackenbush willingly omitting DNA for personal reasons could be cause for firing too

[4:43:20] Itz_Slingshot: TWSS
[4:43:21] Gachiguru: At least have a room in the PD where the cops could setup a computer, mining racks, workbenches etc
[4:43:25] Usahi_Light: @Dash_O_Pepper That's not even a crim thing, that's a full server issue. There's no dependency on anyone if anyone can get a blueprint and make something

[4:43:50] catfish_quackenbush: @docshaayy yea i mean knoone will prob ask, he did report on radio he got a DNA hit, but nothing more. He though it was his own dna, but now, knowing it was Ramees, you would think he would report.
[4:43:54] Pyroder: esfandPrime
[4:43:56] Mickow94: @Janman88 ye, I mean that they need to change something(server) since the repair rp'ers will have nothign to do eventualkly

[4:46:26] EsfandTV: @imjaybirdy, sure thing
[4:46:29] Mickow94: @Janman88, Seems I'm out of touch then but I would figure that eventually everyone is a master mechanic and can repair their own stuff
[4:46:29] Usahi_Light: Plus the devs will make a job pay a bunch and 2 days later nerf it but refuse to modify the blueprints to help alleviate the Material economy. Mechanics have been shafted since the FIRST DAY the server opened
