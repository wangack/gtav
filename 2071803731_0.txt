[1:07:11] cbjester: I wonder if hacking is rep and progression based where the more you do it the more you can steal?
[1:07:12] n3syu: Gambaaaaa
[1:07:13] Zeust2000: hacker rep?
[1:07:15] hornet604: can you use binance to track what addresses just got butcoin

[1:07:46] gateloz: do u get hacker rep for chopping and ac?
[1:07:46] Pjosk___Bey__xD: @riftshadow probably never will people find work arounds fast.
[1:07:47] Adrianetc: more rep = faster to hack maybe ?
[1:07:59] xagious: disconnecting should cost 1 butcoin each time, or group will always disconnect and reconnect each time free of charge.
[1:07:59] geosvk: -17 butc
[1:08:01] akazplays: wasnt it 5 times?
[1:08:04] kilugradi: yeah but it tells the other people that you have butc
[1:08:04] riskemm: @adrianetc maybe more clues?
[1:08:05] detoksi: your stealing from other people so if you hack someone with 0 buttcoin no matter how much rep u have you get 0 buttcoin
[1:08:09] ibomb12: Pretty sure hacking rep is from roof running
[1:08:09] xEvolutions: or x5 more words
[1:08:21] akazplays: tier 5 would give u 5x words to figure out what the word is
[1:08:31] marz777: just use excel
[1:08:31] kilugradi: @Ray__C people will always target the ones with the more security
[1:08:32] xagious: and there will be pc to hack if people always disconnect free of charge.
[1:08:33] imatastypill: this isn't worth wasting Butc on

[1:08:55] SunflowerJessie: gotta remember to disconnect the wifi
[1:08:56] fdsfvdfgdfdvcdf: WHEN YOU START HACKING IT ALERTS THE PEOPLE YOU ARE HACKING AND YOU TOOK TOO LONG AND THEY DISCONNECTED THEIR WIFI BEFORE YOU GUYS FINISHED
