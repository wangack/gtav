[4:07:30] MAGGY23: my gut feeling is my research
[4:07:40] dopesickz: daytrading/ penny stocks are high risk high reward.. but super high stress.. not worth it.
[4:07:40] SkaldFKACC: yes same here! I aim around 3 years and growth for most. but I have some life-longers that'll pass down to next of kin essentially.

[4:08:04] Mavmar: I do Tarot card investing. the cards reveal all
[4:08:14] Krokzter: the strategy that works best for me is look into insiders buying their own stock, and then look into these companies
[4:08:22] senlash: stonko bought nvda based on nidas' vibes and look where he ended up LGiggle
[4:08:35] gostonko: technically its ro666erts fault
[4:08:44] gostonko: he said nvda would 2.5x!
[4:08:49] dopesickz: don't sell.. you're still young.. things like NVDA, ARM, AMD.. those things will just keep going up over time
[4:09:11] SkaldFKACC: Exactly
[4:09:15] 57oni: Cramer says it can go higher, we're screwed.
[4:09:21] slorebear: i heard ro666ert will be running the earnings call today
[4:09:31] Krokzter: tbf realizing gains just loses you money most times due to taxes and inflation

[4:10:55] tekudroid: in Sweden you can pay a fixed 1% tax on capital
[4:11:09] dopesickz: short term gains is 50% on US stocks, (internationally), long term is normal like 7-15%
[4:11:23] Conf1gs: @dopesickz holy shit you guys are getting fucked LUL
[4:11:36] fublian: Yeah ISK really removed all headaches, don't really need to think about taxes for it

[5:22:04] NemisizZ: it would be the same as danish and swedish i assume
[5:22:14] Casualtvip: zetarkCesareWiggle zetarkCesareWiggle
[5:22:14] NemisizZ: like the difference in it
[5:22:19] tundra_snake: it‚Äôs political, it‚Äôs a language‚Ä¶.but in china it‚Äôs a dialect
[5:22:25] Westoffer: yeah cantonese is a language. Its just easier to call it a dialect cause its part of china. Its mutually unintelligible from mandarin
[5:22:34] ModelWrong: @Westoffer this
[5:22:39] ghengis_is_love: the landmass known as modern day china was comprised of like 20 different states/countries
[5:22:43] mochipachi: It's a language, the sentence and vocabulary structures are different than Mandarin
[5:22:45] Dierseus9: yeh basically that
[5:22:46] NemisizZ: they got so many different from the different regions
[5:23:02] Leviwest: @Nidas i like a song they did but when i translate it to english it calls the song Landscape Group - Don't leave "Girl, don't leave, I'll sing a song to keep you here"
[5:23:02] robotsntele: CANTONIA
[5:23:13] ModelWrong: Only complicated if you're part of the Chinese Communist Party, TBH.
[5:23:15] Westoffer: Nope
[5:23:17] bootz_radley: That's where Pokemon come from
[5:23:17] tundra_snake: no
[5:23:18] ModelWrong: no
[5:23:21] mochipachi: Nope
[5:23:31] Dierseus9: exactly same family
[5:23:35] Scwl93: most people speak cantonese is all from hong kong
[5:23:38] tundra_snake: the written language is the same‚Ä¶more or less, pronounced entirely differently
[5:23:45] Ererior: if you are drunk enough, you understand all languages
[5:23:46] salandis186: Always thought it was similar to scandinavian languages?
[5:23:47] mochipachi: Yeah, subset is more accurate
[5:24:17] senlash: sus Krokzter
[5:24:19] senlash: susW
[5:24:23] Krokzter: Sadding
[5:24:33] Leviwest: this is the 1 i heard before lol
[5:24:45] ghengis_is_love: they're pushing mandrin as the main language. older chinese speak their regional language and mandrin
[5:24:58] ghengis_is_love: my dad spoke 4 languages from china
[5:25:03] brutalmoineau: peepoSad
[5:25:12] timbres: This is the song that brings me back to my days in Beijing as a kid Sadding
[5:25:13] tundra_snake: it doesn‚Äôt help that in Hong Kong they tend to use a different Chinese script than the rest of china, traditional vs modern
[5:25:16] NemisizZ: she prolly gets stock in the washingmachine to often

[5:32:24] brutalmoineau: because I wasn't there yet
[5:32:30] Silverheart59: They tried

[5:33:57] tundra_snake: The typhoon that knocked out the Mongolian navy that was invading. was called kamikaze
[5:34:00] NemisizZ: its kinda like Scandinavian history... just without the plague Kappa
[5:34:18] timbres: He was mean to Mulan in that one documentary
[5:34:29] NemisizZ: wasnt they the reason to the great wall got build as well
[5:35:24] Tokenias: just dont spread the plague, garbageman
[5:36:10] goodenow: The Dan Carlin - Hardcore History Podcast about the Mongols is amazing
[5:36:23] bonedead: unlucky
[5:36:26] Krokzter: in japan?
[5:36:27] McSmittty: If they were really smart they would've used Rods of God
[5:36:29] Mavmar: Japan put up a good fight
[5:36:37] Mavmar: @McSmittty this
[5:36:40] Silverheart59: Yeah, hordes don't do so well against nature
[5:36:42] Krokzter: when genghis died there was internal dispute I thought
[5:36:44] Tokenias: natural disaster but mostly when the khans died they all had to go home for funerals, that's what I remember from the hardcore history doc
[5:36:59] K4ZZD: far out man
[5:37:05] Locopapa: frfr
[5:37:16] Silverheart59: Everyone knows it's the water goblins
[5:37:33] Mavmar: who doesnt know some mongolians, am i right?
[5:37:41] McSmittty: That sounds like propaganda from Big Shower ReallyMad
[5:37:41] Leviwest: wait dragons aint real ? what nexts unicorns aint real D:
[5:38:16] pluisjesplukker: There was a chinese filosopher/wiseman who made some pretty cool accounts of his travels and meetings with the mongol kahn. on his way he found entire citys depopulated with only t he dogs howling
[5:38:22] goodenow: arrows from horseback
[5:38:26] pondu1q: i think the trading posts thing?
[5:38:31] Krokzter: I think they abused horse archers when they were op
[5:38:31] pondu1q: near the sea for ports
[5:38:33] StreamElements: Don't forget to resub Ogey https://www.twitch.tv/subs/nidas
[5:38:39] Tokenias: They used to use captured civs as the first line of attack
[5:38:44] pluisjesplukker: the rest murdered after they rebeled against him.
[5:38:45] Tokenias: moral killer
[5:38:47] brutalmoineau: they used meta, and aim assist, mongols were huge cheaters
[5:38:49] Silverheart59: I've never heard of anything particularly clever. Didn't they just have a shit ton of people and were really brutal?
[5:39:20] Galaxy_Gaming09: Hit and run tactics with horses I assume
[5:39:26] crowmane777: A lot of horses and extreme violence
[5:39:31] Tokenias: They absorbed alot of religions and cultures since they were nomads
[5:39:40] Krokzter: most tribes were probably not prepared for battle too
[5:39:47] Tokenias: didn't have a real ideology to preach
[5:39:52] tundra_snake: The Mongolians would offer you to choices, surrender, or be destroyed. The ones that surrendered were then combined with the Mongolian armies, and used as shock troops to their army, kept on getting bigger by using the resources of the people that surrendered.
[5:39:59] Tokenias: Thats why marco polo got to leave alive
[5:40:09] timbres: Nidas couldn‚Äôt be a nomad, he‚Äôs always mad
[5:40:17] pluisjesplukker: I listened to some podcast and he said that a part of their succes was finally uniting, for hundereds of years the chinese would play the different tribes against eachother and stir infighting so they wouldn't rise up. Ghengis was the first to unite the tribes
[5:40:30] Galaxy_Gaming09: Nidas have u watch the Marco poll show in Netflix? Is about kublai
[5:40:36] Galaxy_Gaming09: Polo
[5:41:20] Tokenias: agreed but dan carlin is a god at history podcasts and he cites his sources so you can get the books
[5:41:20] zolahr: Reading you kinda learn it at your speed
[5:42:20] pondu1q: i also rmbr something about trading post that they appointed their own members to and created a 'neutral' trading area... can t rmbr
[5:43:05] Galaxy_Gaming09: The empire was also so big cuz they invented a postal type of information in the silk road
[5:44:22] senlash: DESKCHAN
[5:44:34] Locopapa: Rinsed senlash
[5:44:35] tundra_snake: they collapsed into feuding parts after the great Kahn died, they couldn‚Äôt agree on a united ruler.
[5:45:15] pluisjesplukker: and having basically self sustaining mobile armies (all horses and herds, that would feed on the plains of grass combined with ranged arrows would mean they could move and attack where enemy weak, bait enemies into either standing their ground and take days of arrowstrikes till they were just exhausted or into going after them and falling into an even worse trap. The Mongols were not dumb brutes but  had really good logistics and tactics that the europeans had no answer too
[5:45:21] pluisjesplukker: sorry really long
[5:45:40] Tokenias: I visited a museum in germany on Samarkand (uzbekistan) that's how far alexander the great got in asia, alot of the way he absorbed local tribes mirrored mongols
[5:45:59] Tokenias: just less violent
