[0:14:02] martymagoo78: yeah, giving the guys an actual quota of 100 a day just makes them hit that and stop,
[0:14:09] spaceman0l0: I love ur rp man you and lang been great for my rp expierice over the  years tank man
[0:14:16] DeejaysCrib: KEKW

[0:14:49] DeejaysCrib: hahaha
[0:15:16] snowmugs: tony too KEKW
[0:15:58] martymagoo78: think Ilya seems to be one of those guys that you have to give him a specific amount to sell at a specific time and he will do it, but if you leave it to him to decide he wont do much
[0:16:08] imSyndrine: grimin instead of crimin mans got bills to pay
[0:16:17] martymagoo78: yeah, not a captain
[0:16:30] Sword_Scream: Ilya is ready for a sergeant role, not a captain
[0:16:38] martymagoo78: he can be a pusher who can also drop weed off to other pushers, not a captain
[0:16:44] PedroTaco: He also has a IRL job, so can`t be around much
[0:16:54] DeejaysCrib: Fax
[0:16:59] PedroTaco: does good work, just not enough
[0:17:07] martymagoo78: lang 100% has a yuno bias
[0:17:10] skaybe_: yeah gigi octo and yuno above
[0:17:40] Sword_Scream: Yuno often gets a free ride, because he's a genuinely fun guy to be around. Octo goes above and beyond every day, and Gigi is also a BRILLIANT worker, it makes sense for them to get keys tbh
[0:17:46] called_me_sona: there is no clear rank in the group except for don treasurer need to make it clear i guest
[0:17:46] lj_042: the amount of dirty money from selling weed and your grime money, you can easily pay the 25k
[0:18:05] moe0595: How mant houses now, 3?
[0:18:21] RaBbiTHeaD_: its crew's house maybe?
[0:18:28] martymagoo78: think it is because when he sells the south side house you font have an ‘operational’ house, so the new house is trying to do everything for now
[0:18:35] martymagoo78: *wont
[0:18:48] mokoto05: yeah the mirror park one should be the home of 5 dons + gigi
[0:18:54] HighToker: there star players yuno hacker, octo driver, gigi money

[1:04:17] WeeeeD: i feel like 1k a week is still too low
[1:04:33] vosje91: @dark16sider because people are so busy focusing om money that they forget to have fun
[1:04:39] dbuana: how are you going to recruit pusher? through snr buns?
[1:04:42] martymagoo78: 1000 is fair as they can break that up in small chunks, or even do it all in one day if they wanted to do in a big batch
[1:04:48] dark16sider: @vosje91 Meant the weed game
[1:04:48] SailorWS: everyone is swapping to moonshine
[1:04:49] WeeeeD: 300 a day should be minimum.
[1:05:00] its_neal: bank balance check
[1:05:24] imomoiro: low risk or no risk at all with moonshine
[1:05:28] realitijd24: facts
[1:05:32] DeejaysCrib: Yup
[1:05:42] Xernique: The way you can stack bottles is nutty
[1:05:42] JasmineWynn: Probably because it takes a while to gather the ingredients
[1:05:46] princessmadz7: but if someone finds it they can break it
[1:05:46] charzak: the materials is the bottleneck
[1:05:50] WeeeeD: maybe because moonshine dont have progression? since its not in the app
[1:06:04] baphometthegoat: @sayeedblack what u think of dune part 2 if they do messiah next that has to be spilt into 2 or 3 films
[1:06:04] martymagoo78: its not, cause on your own you cant gather ingredients quick enough to fill all those stills
[1:06:05] lyfmobile: probably with squad
[1:06:15] the_juggernort: in a 12hr storm you could make easily 50-70k.. but getting ingredients is super tough.
[1:06:20] postAmongUsist: also its only 1.2k a still, its not even a big loss
[1:06:21] dark16sider: Time to start war in the sewers
[1:06:28] lolSMCballs: @baphometthegoat dune 2 was fucking amazing
[1:06:36] ty_136: if teddy is growing only once a month its kinda crazy if the gang is trying trying to stay competitive in the weed game
[1:06:39] martymagoo78: harry been doing moonshine full time for a month and he only has 100k… people exaggerate
[1:06:45] lolSMCballs: i havent even read a sungle dune book either
[1:06:47] st0rmblessed__: @SayeedBlack OOC moonshine doesnt need nerf flash house and trailer are with crew funds he didnt contribute more than 150k which any civ can do with grime
[1:06:49] lolSMCballs: single*
[1:06:50] WeeeeD: thoughts on you focus on weed seller while luciano on moon shine since harry is basically R & D on the crew as he jump from job to job.
[1:07:04] the_juggernort: Kaiba is making 50k a day for BBMC LUL

[1:07:42] Shuzan: I mean yea Yuno has 700k
[1:07:44] shazzammxx: i think the idea where you guys compete with all of the pusher is a great way to see who lacking and can give bonus too
[1:07:47] Slice0fBread: Hourly wise does moonshine make the most?
[1:07:48] Denisbog12: Bjorn made 100K in one day yesterday, he didnt produce it, only pushed but still its crazy
[1:07:56] the_juggernort: and harry probably selling shit quality, hasnt got his recipe perfect.
[1:07:58] WeeeeD: @Shuzan i mean yuno been doing g6 for 2 months

[1:08:15] JDwight: become a guber millionaire
[1:08:16] dittocp: Yup, Yuno was doing G6 when it was busted
[1:08:26] martymagoo78: i agree, thats what im saying, moonshine isnt op in relation to others.. its just that weed and sr buns are low compared to everything else
[1:08:29] postAmongUsist: @Slice0fBread moonshine is the best criminal job I think, but grime is the best overall
[1:08:30] baphometthegoat: Most of Harry's time is taken up running around sewers collecting stuff
[1:08:42] WeeeeD: i think that is the reason you cant do job at night anymore
[1:08:44] RizzOnez: Tony is the richest guy in the server rn

[2:20:10] martymagoo78: that’s how it works with  all dirty money jobs
[2:20:11] killa_karpenter: Harry scamming??
[2:20:11] charzak: the house takes cut of both
[2:20:21] kkillimanjaro: @killa_karpenter He's not
[2:20:21] princessmadz7: bc Harry’s the only one doing it that way everyone else is doing it the right way
[2:20:29] lyfmobile: @killa_karpenter nah
[2:20:38] RagingSantas: 24%?

[2:20:46] Deathchampt: Well Harry's knd of scamming his runners
[2:20:58] TibsJC: Harry is the only one not really following the system cause hes mostly flying solo
[2:21:05] dandaredus: @RagingSantas crew takes 30% of the runners 40%
[2:21:05] martymagoo78: a pusher can easily push 10-15k of product an hour…. that’s good money still
[2:21:22] RagingSantas: @dandaredus yeah that'll be 28%

[2:21:49] FRASB0: Harry doesn't just magic up moonshine, he has to sell it. He' spend 5 hours a day making it.
[2:22:00] drakhuuu: the way Harry does the crew will get 30%, Harry 42% and seller 28%, isn’t that it?
[2:22:06] lunorx6: gigi does the same but is giving the moonshine to the crew for free to push and sell for outside of the crew
[2:22:08] martymagoo78: then they both log their dirty money cut, same as Harry and Ilya are doing lol
[2:22:22] martymagoo78: yes @drakhuuu
[2:22:40] Sword_Scream: Because the time spent selling Moonshine is Logarithmic. For weed a baggie takes an average time, but the more crates of moonshine you label and sell at a time, the less time it takes per bottle. Unlike with weed moonshine has a lot of work with gathering, to cook 5 batches Harry has to gather mats for 45mins, which is the time it also takes to cook 5 batches, he has no downtime when pushing moonshine. But you can stack as many crates as you want to label and then sell at once.
[2:23:04] Yoomazir: oh shiii, you alive
[2:23:04] drakhuuu: @martymagoo78 why is it a scam them?
[2:23:10] martymagoo78: it isn’t
[2:23:22] maccystv: Let's go kush kush
[2:23:22] martymagoo78: 60/40 is. dry fair once you know the process
[2:23:30] martymagoo78: *very fair
[2:23:33] lunorx6: how everyone today ?
[2:23:47] StreamElements: Follow Boro on insta and Twitter! Also everyone can add boro on snapchat: Sayeedblack  Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sayeedblack/ Twitter: https://twitter.com/SayeeedBlack
[2:24:27] Sword_Scream: To cook moonshine you spend ~1 week to get your recipe perfected, then you spend 45mins gathering and 45mins cooking for 4-5 batches. But selling it takes the same amount of time if you sell 1 crate as if you sold 10, if you sort it well.
[2:24:33] killa_karpenter: does speedy got to pay the 25k this week @sayeedblack??
[2:24:33] OccasionalTryHard: @lunorx6 good mate how are you?
[2:24:44] martymagoo78: say if Harry spends 3 hours gathering and cooking to make 12 crates of moonshine…. a pusher can push that in less than an hour
[2:24:45] tuhinmalOW: FeelsStrongMan Clap

[2:25:39] everplayz101: yes
[2:25:41] WentToBuyMilkAgain: Yes
[2:25:45] TibsJC: Moonshine earns about 4x times more in the same amount of time
[2:25:49] RagingSantas: it's a cool feature opposed to weed
[2:25:54] knownlethal: everyone and their mama does moonshine and jewlery
[2:25:56] lunorx6: @OccasionalTryHard nice relax just wake up

[2:26:04] Tiilde: dont know who that belongs to tbh
[2:26:14] miiinggguuu: Are the old bois gonna have a crew house?
[2:26:19] mendog1: moonshine is just way better than weed
[2:26:23] WentToBuyMilkAgain: Yeah I think
[2:26:29] Sword_Scream: Grab a crate -> Go to NPC to get it labeled -> Each bottle has a unique label you have to go to (63 locations total) -> Bottles stack if it's the same location
[2:26:30] TropicalToucan: Weed in the hq app has to lead to something

[2:26:41] Suleman_aftab: weed local any good?
[2:26:41] martymagoo78: only the pushing part does @tibsjc the “growing” side takes longer than weed as you need to gather ingredients
[2:26:50] Sorabros: maybe too many people.  who knows
[2:26:53] nixi992: it will slow down once cops start paying attention to it or they change it so locals can f you up like when you sell weed
[2:27:01] miiinggguuu: @TempahDan they gonna sell the southside and mirror park is the don house.
[2:27:20] WentToBuyMilkAgain: I think you need 2 to get a job for crime stuff
[2:27:22] TempahDan: @miiinggguuu no, mirror park will become base of operations, people just have to earn keys
[2:27:27] ty_136: if the crew is trying to stay competitive in the wed game it looks like it needs a dedicated crew tbh
[2:27:28] buh___b: 21k ye

[2:29:49] WentToBuyMilkAgain: 21k
[2:29:52] pluxd: except if cops catch you, you lose 20k for the crew
[2:29:54] Zhingz: for like 15mins of work its nice
[2:30:00] martymagoo78: no cuts for anyone until they have given 25k
[2:30:07] WentToBuyMilkAgain: It's just 15mins
[2:30:11] ty_136: if you clean 21k you get 1050
[2:30:17] dittocp: most likely
[2:30:17] TempahDan: no, the dirty cash earned counts
[2:30:18] martymagoo78: 15k is used to calculate your kick back
[2:30:20] Tiilde: 25k clean or dirty
[2:30:20] Xernique: You get kickbacks from q5k
[2:30:21] 00Elite: no it counts
[2:30:22] flensost: 25 k is for the weekly and 15k u will get kickback for

[2:31:32] Teddsan: cuz then crew would lose money sayeed
[2:31:34] TempahDan: 25k is just the minimum amount you need to bring in, so after you've done that, everything else counts towards your kickback

[5:32:29] EddiestyleCZ: Susge

[5:34:12] beean1985: sell it for cheap so they make money and sell scooby on the block all day
[5:34:13] Foxxera_tv: Cost of 1 brick its 400/500
[5:34:20] lightstormclaw: @umathys sellers dont need to be on the main app
[5:34:30] umathys: Yeah the other deal is a nobrainer indeed, thats speedy cooking that 5 star recipe
[5:34:36] Karnall: would need to adjust grower pay for sold bricks

[5:38:25] somerandomguy_97: How many growers  do you have?
[5:38:27] Karnall: grower gets paid based on 19/bag so would have to adjust for the lower sale price
[5:38:31] Rafael_Trujillo: can you sell scooby on any turf? if so, would it effect anything?
[5:38:37] castusartoriuslucius: lol

[5:39:18] beean1985: yup everyone is on a even playing field basically
[5:39:21] WentToBuyMilkAgain: Yeah everyone is equal at this point
[5:39:25] Joenips: @rafael_trujillo it won’t effect Scooby strain but it might begin to push up the other turf
[5:39:25] temespeti: Cousin would clap all of them and stay clean
[5:39:27] pewpewll: CG robbed luciano twice and they did nothing about it
[5:39:34] TyrantFPS: @rafael_trujillo the o ly thing it would do is it wouldn't help cypress rep
[5:39:36] mrdumpling420: KJ v SPEEDY
[5:39:45] clumsytom: @EhnOhSee but its clean easy money. 600 to growers, 300 to the house for example
[5:39:45] a_ou1: to not be scared of nobody you need an army of solders that are not afraid of waring

[5:40:11] Malark3y420: I wish the 100% turf rep actually meant something
[5:40:13] fenixblac: 😜 in the middle of moving… hahaha
[5:40:14] castusartoriuslucius: can't do anything when they have guns
[5:40:15] beean1985: @pewpewll it wasn’t personal though….everyone is getting robbed by them.
[5:40:18] Sl33pyJinn: cuz they didnt have magazines
[5:40:28] marzisrippin: some things aren’t worth the retaliation imo
