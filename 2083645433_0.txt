[3:01:50] jinxedluck: 2 apps 1 strain mhm
[3:01:56] Spacely_Man: you just dont need to be on the app to push the strain
[3:03:13] swankytiger942221: You can have an app without having a strain
[3:03:40] dripydryp: is the company first?
[3:03:42] maxlbon: wtf is he saying

[3:03:52] maxlbon: no way thats not allowed
[3:04:06] Fluxsworn: @maxlbon they are trying to not meta by saying he's going to ask devs or something
[3:04:08] TheDev97: @maxlbon nidas is an admin, he is not sure if they intended to make hq apps work like that, so he double checking rules
[3:04:09] swankytiger942221: Pretty much wait for no reason
[3:04:12] reezyy92: hes saying even tho other people use multiple apps bcos

[3:05:09] Phoenix__08: mhm
[3:05:16] StrawHatGerry: mhm
[3:05:19] Spacely_Man: more worth to save up for ammunation and bps
[3:05:22] Devbringer97: @Phoenix__08 depends on the situation and if they wann do heist rp why not its fun
[3:05:22] buy_back_jay: Maybe it's cos your borth in the same car that's why the car did not show up
[3:05:23] Eatchy_: at least its good to know you can have the same app be the weed strain and turning dongle in
[3:05:25] swankytiger942221: If it's a problem they would just say. I'd just do it and if they don't like it they woulf tell you it
[3:05:28] bigpune: look guys im the head admin in my head so what i say go

[3:05:42] Eatchy_: can you sign in without buying that turf tho?
[3:05:51] swankytiger942221: You don't need a strain on the app.
[3:05:52] FlyingScotsman__: the app will need to have the turf to be able to sell on it tho no?
[3:05:53] ComfyAura: wheres chickentikka when you need him LMFAO
[3:06:06] svan223: @whitecut1 4head said the exact same thing ming is saying but than AK said he needs to check with devs to see if thats how they are intended
[3:06:08] Eatchy_: the weed sellers on the 2nd app
[3:06:12] nikkomanii: @whitecut1 how is asking an admin holing his pockets?
[3:06:20] Phoenix__08: mhm 󠀀
[3:06:20] 4HeadsDustyGun: To sell weed, you need to sign in with turf guy
[3:06:21] Athasin: @whitecut1 Some people like having a sounding board instead of being arrogant enough to think they know everything
[3:06:25] maxlbon: yes
[3:06:27] juneOT: u just need a strain
[3:06:33] drharls97: you’re saying new app for the heists right ?
