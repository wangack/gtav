[5:42:32] ultranostalgia: Doing nothing related to my degree lmao
[5:42:32] ShiffTM: i mean its a scam but sure
[5:42:33] hydrophoeniix: Nope
[5:42:34] estupidhigh: college is fun
[5:42:35] Diealated: I went to enough college to get student debt
[5:42:37] Diealated: not worth
[5:42:37] estupidhigh: it’s different
[5:42:41] GoldenHusky458: It's alright
[5:42:42] onxly_jj: i’m kinda excited for it

[5:42:59] ThrownStone: You learn to learn fast.
[5:43:00] VaRcTiCx: wish I went for the experience but I came out alright
[5:43:01] Kingoftherandos: Def worth only for certain professions. Most though you don't need the debt
[5:43:02] CRlCK: @Acie you didn't miss out on anything trust me
[5:43:04] GoldenHusky458: hate travelling 2 hours for college :)
[5:43:09] cutz28: with no expenses paid for
[5:43:10] WhiteLotus04: it’s dope for building social skills partying and having indiscriminate s3x but very expensive
[5:43:14] ShiffTM: unfortunately im in it for game design and with AI growing i literally wont need to exist soon
[5:43:15] ultranostalgia: It really depends on what you study and what you do with your time there
[5:43:17] ShiffTM: but its whatever
[5:43:21] ultranostalgia: Everyone will have a diff experience
[5:43:22] ShiffTM: i have lots more skills

[5:43:34] BleachDrinka: im a math major. it stinks sometimes
[5:43:41] HeyElora: Definitely depends on the country. I hear people talk about their college experience in the US and sounds way different to mine in Europe.
[5:43:51] Clodhoppr: I get that
[5:43:56] Kingoftherandos: Having to do classes you did in highschool again (English / math) is the biggest scam
[5:44:02] cutz28: AI is the only major u need now
[5:44:08] CRlCK: i still don't have that experience
[5:44:11] onxly_jj: i’m going for pr, and i feel like that’s so silly to major in
[5:44:12] WhiteLotus04: in America Fafsa pays for majority of tuition if your parents make below a certain bracket
[5:44:16] strangemrgamer: what would you go for then?
[5:44:24] DevWare: the dorms sucked
[5:44:28] morgiepattie: @kingoftherandos literally
[5:44:32] cutz28: everyone will have to learn it soon
[5:44:33] crazyiitopii: PayWall education seems pretty messed up don't ya think in general
[5:44:34] binks_24: school is overrated and puts you in debt. I have a paper that cost me 55k and I’m not even working in the field I studied smh
[5:44:39] ThrownStone: Worth it
[5:44:47] cutz28: how to fix an program robots
[5:44:47] DevWare: my roommate was a nightmare and flooded our whole dorm :) then got sick all over the floor
[5:44:54] TinaBelchh: i am living for your ass girl
[5:44:56] RenOfficially: @sahilzack idk I’d want a doctor that went to school over one that learned it for “free”
[5:45:02] ShiffTM: that gyaaaaat saving lives

[5:45:07] TinaBelchh: i wish the server i was on had booty like that
[5:45:18] WhiteLotus04: college in the states is essentially an all expenses paid s3x resort, a lot of fun
[5:45:24] ultranostalgia: But a big uni would be a diff experience probably idk it’s all different
[5:45:37] CRlCK: i like college cus it helped me realize that people suck
[5:45:45] cutz28: what does the character do when ur not playing
[5:45:46] ShiffTM: you needed college for that babe?

[9:51:32] niteflyeruzi: @Clodhoppr Because it chills your vocal cords and makes them tighter
[9:51:44] mariannsp: danceee
[9:51:47] DaltCL: @apexkylie glad to hear you are good. hope you have a great night and great rest of your week! <3
[9:51:57] UtokaKat: Does anyone have a recommendation for a server to gain experience in? No applications...
[9:51:59] duke_kurogami: Helium is a less dense gas, which helps the vibrations of your vocal cords to move very quickly, so they emit a high, squeaky sound.

[9:52:11] Clodhoppr: @niteflyeruzi shhhhhh KEKW
[9:52:12] j_pandy: @niteflyeruzi no
[9:52:20] Moochinnn: The speed of sound in helium is nearly three times higher than that in air, which makes the sound waves shorter in length, and increases the frequencies the resonators produce. making your voice higher sounding
[9:52:22] whyminton: u can also sit with raia on arm
