[0:20:55] pinewood_mist: @39SaltyCookies so how are videos sorted when there are tie votes?
[0:21:34] NuclearSlayer52: @39SaltyCookies are the videos stored as some form of list, to effectively allow a bruteforce check for if videos need to be removed? also, if a series is a majority of a redacted person, should episodes without them also be reported?
[0:22:35] 39SaltyCookies: @ethereal_17 I believe that the video is chosen randomly from the tied options.

[0:26:13] 39SaltyCookies: @NuclearSlayer52 They are stored as a list, and we also have a list of banned videos in the backend of cinema, which are added manually, so I don't think there's an inbuilt feature to check if a video needs to be removed. As the list is itemised per video, I don't believe that series episodes without redacted individuals need to be reported.
[0:26:47] 39SaltyCookies: Hopefully that helps
[0:28:55] NuclearSlayer52: i think so yes, thanks zoeyWub
