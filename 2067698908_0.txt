[2:01:16] Gucio37: Good test would also be - 1 bottle from batch delivered by you Harry, 1 bottle from the same batch delivered by someone with lower rep, to see how much rep affects it
[2:01:18] blouse_92: whats more profitable right now weed or moonshine?
[2:01:30] KcsBack: nah theres a 130 around the corner COPIUM
[2:01:34] FiniteResources: Hmmm  ah yes the bis
[2:01:38] Eoghan_OMalley: I was about to ask if rep could also boost price but I guess that lower price confirms it for me that it doesn't
[2:01:44] tannerrobbz: This shit is interesting

[2:02:13] jayrowzy: Sadge

[2:04:13] eachrare: @Harry what have i missed did you guys have meeting yet?
[2:04:45] Eoghan_OMalley: @gucio37 true but its not like one price for all average bottles, there is a scale to it in each grade

[4:24:09] ronnie7232: is all the average same proof or is there a range?
[4:24:32] Sword_Scream: @1Shortbus1 Yeah, if it works multiplicative it would make sense
[4:25:35] dogma4202112: I think it is different for every person, so it probably has nothing to do with real elements
[4:26:20] mecryfull: are you sure the 2 dollar increase is formula and not rep ?
[4:26:45] Gucio37: Looking from a software developer perspective, I would either generate all permitations and then gvive them random modifiers (bad for gameplay because there is no logic to discover), or give some multiplier to each ingredient
[4:26:53] mecryfull: like there is a rep for sellign the moonshine ?
[4:27:17] Gucio37: The ordering and cancelling out just sounds like nightmare to code, and this is my only reason that I don't think it's true

[7:56:39] Sablotron: Martin 1000% would hit the moonshine trap and spiral into spreadsheet void.
[7:57:10] ryuudrg: so moonshine is paying more them weed already?
[7:57:12] Tamzim: when crim jobs are safter than  civ job
[7:57:34] f2pOH: @Tamzim Gotta be a thief to receive that honor amongst em

[7:58:00] tannerrobbz: Hopefully that water doesn‚Äôt go bad
[7:58:30] Sword_Scream: @ryuudrg Moonshine is also a bigger investment. You have to be sewer-specced. If you do anything above ground your sewer rep drops. You're looking at a 10hr investment before you can get mats at a decent rate, then you're looking at maybe 1-2 weeks of getting garbage money cuz your formula is bad
[7:58:40] Sword_Scream: Where as weed you can function normally at any point

[8:00:47] EyeScraem: @Sablotron yea pawn rep is so slow
