[1:29:00] EdarZhar: do not fucking blame you for that tbh
[1:29:17] GamesBeTripping: fair enough...
[1:29:33] Richabus2: pumpkaaPat
[1:30:03] Khaza_: Yep
[1:30:04] Nightbot: YEP COPS
[1:30:21] FLIGHTL355: Absolutely love your RP, you are an amazing person and an inspiration. Truly a hero.

[1:35:13] retrojay75: how long did it take nopixel to get a server up and running on gta V ?
[1:35:21] ItsMavray: only LSPD
[1:35:23] Abuuts: anulLove anulLove
[1:35:59] MarinoV1: it's definitely strange how it's been handled
[1:36:01] DyingHappy: @retrojay75 3.0 and 4.0 had about a years worth of work put into them by the dev team ahead of time
[1:36:14] retrojay75: ahh ok cool
[1:36:44] Issillien: PD has always felt like an afterthought on NP to me
[1:36:46] GamesBeTripping: uhm...
[1:36:54] retrojay75: was just wondering for gta 6
[1:37:03] AvantGaunt: The skeleton crew pd were "encouraged" to make new characters. But several didn't.
[1:37:17] Richabus2: "My favourite streamer went to fight in Ukraine,and all I got was this lousy t-shirt" freyzLovethat
[1:38:41] MarinoV1: inexplicably though there's a few cops that *are* the same character as before. it's very inconsistent.
[1:38:47] Normal_Bates: Yep
[1:38:47] Nightbot: YEP COPS
[1:38:52] Richabus2: pmelPikadance iceyayPep nihmunLaugh
[1:39:14] MarinoV1: for example, Rhodes is the same.
[1:39:22] doffmeistah: Brian Knight
[1:39:31] Keku89: Hii Cath and chat! cath4L
[1:39:41] Normal_Bates: And the players are the same
[1:39:44] Pixelz: I think they're trying to make the PD less serious
[1:39:51] doffmeistah: yep
[1:39:51] Nightbot: YEP COPS
[1:40:16] Khaza_: @Pixelz To the point no cops know the law and are all sbs? LUL
[1:40:36] SnakyAxe: @LordTomoyoshi wrangler is on onyx
[1:40:36] kingshwing: not less serious. they're trying to hold PD more accountable
[1:40:38] MarinoV1: people should be scared
[1:40:42] ItsElnari: hard agree, v low stakes rn
[1:41:23] Richabus2: cath4KEK
[1:41:23] Nightbot: cath4KEK
[1:41:35] AvantGaunt: There's no reason to be act subtly as a criminal with no police presence yeah.

[1:42:51] Normal_Bates: Considering who's in charge, I'm not surprised about the state of the police
[1:42:55] Nobbleberry: NODDERS
[1:42:56] MarinoV1: at some point, nothing matters
[1:43:11] Yfrag: is the eye tracker laggy for anyone else?
[1:43:14] Nightbot: Yes
[1:43:33] Pixelz: I think they're trying to make it less serious and more "content"
[1:43:58] Pixelz: that's what they were trying to do with pred & wrangler in 3.0 as well imo
[1:44:23] Pixelz: more like a police parody kind of thing
[1:44:32] Quru: ew roleplay
[1:44:37] Pixelz: I'm not disagreeing with you
[1:44:37] davidayotte: less serious means he don’t want rp
[1:44:38] tenGreg: Idk if grindfest that is 4.0 so far is content
[1:44:39] dukegummybear: criminals widely complained when cops werent being serious in 3.0 as well did they not?
[1:44:40] niNjaAkuma: maybe the slow start (regarding cops) is so that the brand new viewers can see something evolve rather than theres already something efficent there
[1:44:43] Khaza_: Having competent cops chasing you is even better content
[1:44:45] Quru: hey!
[1:44:46] Richabus2: cath4Wiggle
[1:44:48] StepPogger: the 4.0 boom will be short, variety guests will leave an the lregulars will get bored
[1:44:58] thechosenpie: I've gotta go for now. Thank you for being a lovely human cath4L
[1:44:59] Quru: i'm good, hope you're doing good too
[1:45:04] Quru: glad to see you back
[1:45:05] retrojay75: does it feel like things are slowing down a bit with 6 coming next year?
[1:45:06] Nightbot: No
[1:45:10] Ara_Memnoch: most of the big cops are weekday only streamers
[1:45:12] astro_orbiter: @tenGreg not content you enjoy but it's content none the less
[1:45:24] dukegummybear: I remember them saying something to the effect of "Dont be tabbed out playing other games during bank hold outs"
[1:45:29] Nightbot: Join us on Discord! We have cat pictures, memes, and a bunch of really cool supportive people. https://discord.gg/cathfawr
[1:45:29] PsychoUK666: i think the problem is going to be that a few of the consistent serious cops have moved on either no longer wish to be a cop or have other things going on and they would need to rebuild that with new people
[1:45:33] FLIGHTL355: Personally I loved seeing investigations and consequences.
[1:45:47] MarinoV1: @retrojay75 GTA6 doesn't even have a PC date yet. Most likely a year after consoles if Rockstar's history says anything.
[1:45:50] Richabus2: Hey Cath I'm going to Anime Con next month,do you think I should cosplay,or do you think going in streamer merch is enough?
[1:45:50] tenGreg: 3.0 made cops be basically AI already
[1:45:56] tenGreg: seeing PD atm is painfull to me :D
[1:46:31] kingshwing: @LordTomoyoshi Ssaab, Xiceman, Cheever7. Baass, Bayo, and Aurora from 3.0. all playing new characters
[1:46:43] retrojay75: @MarinoV1 thought was announced middish 2025?
[1:46:44] RoyLeeTV: Truuue
[1:46:49] retrojay75: or was that console only
[1:46:53] Khaza_: @retrojay75 GTA 6 won't release on PC until 2026 at the earies, and RP probably 2027 at the earliest. Maybe even later. Shouldn't affect GTA V RP.
[1:47:02] dukegummybear: its a very gta online approach which is a bit odd
[1:47:02] MarinoV1: @retrojay75 only consoles officially
[1:47:03] Khaza_: *earliest
[1:47:12] retrojay75: ah got it
[1:47:13] Shayeta: how is the cop situation going on onx? I only watch Strippin RP his cop there every once in a while, idk what the mood is there
[1:47:16] allotras: i think they will introduce guns and heists when the pd is there but it is my opinion of course
[1:47:37] tenGreg: ONX PD = ERP bananza apparently so far
[1:47:46] tenGreg: But everyone says its great
[1:47:48] Shayeta: ye I saw the "car wash"
[1:47:49] tenGreg: is what i have heard
[1:47:49] Nightbot: No
[1:47:51] frogmario: cop shortage there too
[1:48:04] ItsElnari: im ONX cop hehe
[1:48:08] LordAndy316: I've been enjoying onx pd
[1:48:10] Khaza_: just "transfer" in ez Kappa
[1:48:11] Olyimpic1: Haven't seen you live in a longggg time
[1:48:15] RYJarnovk: Without meta-ing. The server is still missing mechanical essentials for PD to be ready to deal with crime too
[1:48:17] SlipStream0: didnt onx only just start taking on cadets?
[1:48:21] RYJarnovk: Nopixel I mean
[1:48:22] MsMcGoo: Myles is doing some great stuff with grapespeed PD
[1:48:24] EdarZhar: I watch a couple Vtubers who've been playing on ONX lately
[1:48:25] ItsElnari: @frogmario they had a hiring wave recently
[1:48:31] DamiarErse: they're doing academy right now on onx, so th e cop shortage won't be much longer.
[1:49:10] DamiarErse: I imagine they're wanting to get the cops up and trained, and then pushing more crime hopefully
[1:49:15] RoyLeeTV: Head Hunter cop Pog
[1:49:19] tenGreg: I always hated how much cops were arresting over fake plats
[1:49:22] tenGreg: plates*
[1:49:26] astro_orbiter: YES
[1:49:29] RoyLeeTV: Nope
[1:49:34] Normal_Bates: Not in NP
[1:49:34] Khaza_: Made sense for Vale not to go into investigations etc. because Summer knew so much on the crim side
[1:49:39] tenGreg: It was always like "Traffic stop, oh you have a fake plate, you are going to jail"
[1:49:39] dukegummybear: not right now, there's too many growing pains right now
[1:49:56] ItsElnari: @tenGreg i got arrested over a dice roll KEKW
[1:50:01] tenGreg: It devolved into noone using fake plates cause it was more headache than anything else
[1:50:22] Khaza_: yeah
[1:50:31] MarinoV1: have you run into Flo (Dick) yet?
[1:50:44] lilpuma133: Sup, @cathfawr
[1:51:04] raeken88: cath4Hehe
[1:51:09] emanonion: That's why most hvtu are a gang/group now cause the 4.0 police department doesn't want this approach.at least for now
[1:51:12] frankbam: Hey Cath, are you fully back streaming?
[1:51:19] nerdypatty: it's very easy as cops to just grief people into the ground dealing with that on the current server I'm on atm
[1:51:35] tenGreg: @emanonion Just wait till everyone has guns, gang wars, constant robberies.
[1:51:37] ufowndwaldo: You and Fairlights cops where my absolute fav

[2:01:24] nerdypatty: but in the long run not having fucking integrity will fuck em later so fuck em

[2:01:59] Spelliepanda: good morning Cath and chat
[2:02:00] Richabus2: I've been playing Pokemon Violet again and chose the Grass type starter,right at the beginning of the game you can just farm exp by Leafageing Psyducks (not Buizels,their too tanky)
[2:02:08] Ara_Memnoch: if its all new people in the pd now, who's gonna run you off? peepoGiggles
[2:02:09] dukegummybear: more than likely a lot of them are just followers and one person said "cath bad" and they all just fell into line. thats usually what happens
[2:02:16] laertes1: When you are ready, I will say, I've been watching ONX cop, and they actually get to RP
[2:02:58] Ara_Memnoch: NODDERS

[2:04:29] RYJarnovk: Shift1 PD vs people like Yokai was the best content 3.0 had imo

[2:05:28] dukegummybear: detroit simulator
[2:05:29] Chicken9man: bronze PD vs radiant crims

[2:06:11] Khaza_: Might as well add the GTA Online NPC cops
[2:06:15] Nogiskits: will look sick on my youtube vid brah WICKED

[2:08:11] nyyankees1973: Long time no see. Missed you
[2:08:14] Ogichihollow: its more rewarding to get away from extremely competent cops in my opinion then non competent ones.
[2:08:16] Lammynatos: The trouble with more Ws is that it gets samey so quick.
[2:08:48] Ogichihollow: true ture
[2:09:13] Olyimpic1: Its soo interesting that this is the first conversation about cop RP I've listened to in 3 years i think, and its the same points again.

[2:10:11] RunnerFaith: NODDERS

[2:10:33] seniorbruelo: criminal group hiring a competent driver? no cry about Angel
[2:10:35] nerdypatty: RP? Nah they just added sprays we don't gotta RP anymore
[2:10:35] Lammynatos: These are the same kind of folks that want an easy mode in dark souls.
[2:10:38] Normal_Bates: no tackling for cops, nodders
[2:10:41] Khaza_: Yeah.. Cops shooting a crim sounds like an opporunity for court RP, not DMs and OOC firing
[2:10:57] Richabus2: *a subathon quote
[2:11:18] EkSpectre: If you're in that position you already fucked up lol

[2:12:03] ichijazz: harrB and then submarine harrEz
[2:12:08] MarinoV1: and then they removed cop tackling LUL
[2:12:27] Nightbot: Did you know? Subscribing to Cath instantly gives you up to 136 street cred. It also gives you some pretty bitchin emotes, ad free viewing, and access to a super cool discord channel. While stocks last. Your statutory rights are not affected. Tell your friends.
[2:12:30] Ara_Memnoch: court rp is fun with an incompetent police force
[2:12:33] Ogichihollow: i self imposed a limit of two tazes and i couldnt go past that cuase it didnt make sense to me to keep shrugging off tazes
[2:12:45] Ara_Memnoch: quite comical
[2:12:45] doffmeistah: only pogs and w`s
[2:12:50] grass3nthusiast: <3 <3
[2:13:07] ichijazz: and he probably got warned 7 times that they would be shot
[2:13:19] RYJarnovk: What about them making mechanical changes for things like animation canceling the tazer. Just get rid of those people, no need to code fixes for that imo
[2:13:25] Khaza_: I remember Summer came in hot to save someone LUL
[2:13:28] tenGreg: i have done some big interference pits and stuff
[2:13:32] Nightbot: Join us on Discord! We have cat pictures, memes, and a bunch of really cool supportive people. https://discord.gg/cathfawr
[2:13:40] tenGreg: But then i am like "Alrgiht now i gotta dip to calm them down"
[2:13:58] tenGreg: But then there are people who com eback 6 times after doing 100+ pits and are like "Oh why"
[2:14:04] ichijazz: like slumping
[2:14:14] ichijazz: they just dev'd that out
[2:14:18] crazeman87: Like people abusing the farmer market/dean world
[2:14:26] tenGreg: Oh i know
[2:14:38] Richabus2: cath4NOM brioche? PikaRamen
[2:14:38] Nogiskits: that's the onx mindset from what I've seen, they have powerful mechanics like the cinematic cam but they won't take it away, just ban abusers
[2:14:55] laertes1: That's why it was one of ONX key talking points when they launched that they wouldn't do that, would just ban.
[2:15:03] EkSpectre: I never liked Benny's repairing mid chase anyway
[2:15:10] D4RP4chief: Good to see you on, Cath. Off to lurk land. Thank you for the awesome stickers!
[2:15:25] MsMcGoo: the fact people were wipping all the cops so they wouldn't pick up evidevidence was horrible to watch
[2:15:25] MadnessQuotient: Do you think that will change now that people get injured so easily from car crashes?
[2:15:38] tenGreg: I have always been FAFO on cop
[2:15:48] beachyuknow: What's happening
[2:16:01] beachyuknow: Is she just driving around
[2:16:02] Nightbot: Yes
[2:16:18] beachyuknow: Ok I just joined
[2:16:43] kingshwing: did you like Bayo's cop RP?
[2:16:44] EkSpectre: It seems like current attitude is cops being their to enable RP by being pressure vs actual competition.
[2:17:25] tenGreg: I was so happy when Techas made cop
[2:17:28] kingshwing: I've been enjoying watching his Cpt Turner RP
[2:17:32] BlazeHDizzle: uhnBayo
[2:17:41] vasuba: yeah high command was mandatory new cops
[2:17:46] tenGreg: It was "Finally i have someone competent to chase people, who won't be scared"
[2:18:05] kryilce: essentially it boils down to NoPixel wants cops as props not characters
[2:18:43] tenGreg: Just break off the high speed chase KEKW
[2:19:00] bezley_snipes: GTA is fundamentally just cops and robbers. Can't ignore the balance - fails as a concept without that
[2:19:07] Nogiskits: "do your jobs", "wait not like that" LUL
[2:19:44] cagey87: riseblap was always good cop crim rp, perfect example of making rp out of taking an "L"
[2:19:56] Richabus2: Barbados' flag is Blue and Yellow too,I'm from Barbados but born in England
[2:20:06] bezley_snipes: yeah 100%, needs equal footing
[2:20:18] ichijazz: A good balance I saw was Suarez vs Lang at the end of 3.0, like Saurez was going hard but Lang had all the toys to get away
[2:20:18] Nogiskits: everyone is a super criminal terrorist who steals banks, deals drugs and arms and doesn't afraid of anything
[2:20:44] Hobbitbot: though honestly it's always kind of made me chuckle a little this whole 'cops going to hard' idea when the base game cop NPCs will shoot the shit out of you for looking at them for too long
[2:21:37] Khaza_: hmm
[2:21:38] cosnik: Molly is so good
[2:21:38] jerabet: @Hobbitbot I don't know anyone who would seriously RP in the base game tho.
[2:21:40] tenGreg: inbefore he has been following you this whole time Kappa
[2:21:44] bezley_snipes: I am also beginning to think that LUL
[2:21:59] theatlantic_ambassador: Half the thrill of being of crim comes from the cat and mouse that keeps things interesting. The changing of the tides for each side.
[2:22:18] Hobbitbot: @Hobbitbot No. But that's the world this is taking place in, where the cops are ridiculously aggressive.
[2:22:24] Nightbot: Join us on Discord! We have cat pictures, memes, and a bunch of really cool supportive people. https://discord.gg/cathfawr
[2:22:38] Hobbitbot: exactly
[2:22:39] Xzyreo: it's quite interesting seeing the different pov's of crims from start of 3.0 to now.
[2:22:58] Olyimpic1: Yo chat i haven't watched NoPixel li at all for a long ass time. Are there still big name crim chars that are not getting their hands dirty directly like Raja or Don or someone like they were?
[2:23:09] EkSpectre: Be competent without that being a fault?
[2:23:11] cagey87: yeah is no fun if there's no stakes
[2:23:18] Richabus2: Woo CathFawr!
[2:23:56] Issillien: I miss those cloak and dagger old QF days
[2:24:00] Khaza_: NODDERS
[2:24:01] mugcostanza: cath4Cozy
[2:24:03] Hobbitbot: That's what I'm saying. That's why it makes me chuckle. That the base world this is based in is a world where the cops are ridiculously aggressive. So it's always been kind of strange to me that cops being competent but far more restrained was a problem.

[2:34:58] astro_orbiter: gotta ramp that semi onto the roof to get up there lol
[2:36:44] NLRubberDucky: in rp its because the old pd "failed" with the sanguine war fiasco
[2:37:26] RYJarnovk: And what about the cop that essentially was the reason for it, Brian. I think he got hired back so that doesnt make any sense
[2:37:38] InJeopardyy: Stubble not getting hired back was criminal imo
[2:37:57] Ruzmuz: maybe they dont want cops remembering people like pred or wrangler but its still very dumb

[2:38:20] MsMcGoo: reno911 like cops
[2:38:21] gravitydefyingturtle: a force of Wayne Thunders?
[2:38:26] MarinoV1: @InJeopardyy he was part of the original skeleton crew...and then mysteriously suddenly not.
[2:38:50] Ruzmuz: his new cop on ONX is very serious
[2:38:52] gravitydefyingturtle: sorry, wasn't a jab at BD, I meant goofy cops
[2:38:59] RYJarnovk: @Ruzmuz But they hired Cornwood back for skeleton crew round 1. All these arguments fall apart at the first question about it (not directed at you personally)
[2:39:00] StepPogger: I remember in 3.0 when Vale was stalking someone and happened to see Lang go into a warehouse. And buddha saw Vale and his whole chat was monka for several days
[2:39:12] Khaza_: The rare competent cops are the "diversity hires" LUL
[2:39:16] Shayeta: but cath, bein careful and being intimidated that is some beta male shit. How is my alpha male streamer supposed to be his true self if he isn't mowing down the pd of goofbals?
[2:39:29] Ruzmuz: @RYJarnovk Oh yeah forgot cornwood got hired
[2:39:30] StepPogger: yeah
[2:39:38] ichijazz: Yup you burned his spot lol
[2:39:53] AbebeMo: Mrs Cath cuppyLove miss yah, long long time
[2:41:22] heroicomedia: No bad a#$ cop character in 4.0 Miss Cath?
[2:41:40] crazeman87: everyone making new characters would be really interesting
[2:41:46] thesoupacabra: they weren't even consistent about making people roll new characters either. I don't get it

[2:42:10] Khaza_: It's been interesting to see certain charactes go very different routes in 4.0, but it doesn't necessarily make sense
[2:42:11] Moriskar: Its been real weird not seeing Forcer since 4.0
[2:42:20] ichijazz: Cornwood is fan service
[2:42:27] Khaza_: yeah
[2:42:31] sunnyplease: @thesoupacabra wonder if they changed their minds at some point, noticed vivienne grey, louise campbell and rhodes are back now
[2:42:41] crazeman87: Corpa
[2:42:48] RYJarnovk: I know you're right. Just kinda sad it is that way but it is what it is

[2:45:10] laertes1: And that's what they are doing now again
[2:45:11] NLRubberDucky: Gym class RP
[2:45:12] ichijazz: Sadly I wanna say it's because viewers will be in chat saying "well this is classic X cop in 2.0 looks like they'll never change" but i don't know
[2:45:36] crazeman87: I hated how they fired a bunch of people that Libby/Dark wanted to keep just because of "reasons"
[2:45:46] Khaza_: "Where did all the good cops go?"
[2:45:47] BakinPacman: doing it now they are not trying to rush things at the moment still so it depends on how things pace out
[2:45:54] Nogiskits: 3.0 PD was consistently dismantled, especially when CPD's protagonism rustled some jimmies, it was sad to see as a viewer
[2:46:25] kryilce: they had 100s of PD applicants. No idea how many they actually accepted for academy
