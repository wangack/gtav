[1:35:23] imomoiro: @basicalIypotato Yeah. I think what they want is even if you donate...it will be counted as towards top earner so you will still have a kickback, and like giving money to just nothing...

[8:17:21] ochoa_18: I should have paid attention in chem class KEKW
[8:17:36] zer0cool1138: If wz was useless I don't see how having 2 in the recipe kept the average
[8:17:38] bigchimpo: Harry can add a touch of Neodymium magnets to his recipe?
[8:17:49] bigchimpo: Pog
[8:18:58] Sablotron: none of the symbols are chemiclas nor compounds, they're just inscriptions in dials of the still in "sewer language" so nobody will ever understand what they mean. counter COPIUM hypothesis KEWK
[8:19:37] zer0cool1138: I kind of have a alternate theory that the recipe might require finding "pairs" of elements that go together like building a compound.

[8:44:57] LarconReaper: monkaHmm
[8:45:02] LarconReaper: crack cocaine
[8:45:21] ChiefinIt: yea seems like there are other variables
[8:45:52] zer0cool1138: Yeah I assumed hu was important and then though maybe  abcde had something right and edcba had something completely different right
[8:45:52] guygavin: those 5 elements are average as long as the middle is the same
[8:45:59] eazypzz: im just hoping this master recipe is different for every player
[8:46:00] Kydoc: if everyones recipe is different, then its gotta be random, no?
[8:46:06] bird24287: you know who knows? Sincere lol
[8:46:18] imSyndrine: it hink theres a half reward for correct but inwrong position
[8:46:33] zer0cool1138: I think b b c d e being average is a clue.
[8:46:48] Sword_Scream: If Hu in the middle is your theory, and you've tried [A], [B], Hu, [D], [E] and [E], [D], Hu, [B], [A]. Have you considered that two of the [A], [B], [D], [E] might take mulitple spots?
[8:47:26] Niktory: @zer0cool1138 bbc hehe
[8:47:35] zer0cool1138: Yeah @sword_scream we also have  b b c d e as average
[8:48:14] eazypzz: 69 for water?
[8:48:18] LarconReaper: wtf xqcHead
[8:48:40] iDanwatch: trade him
[8:48:54] iDanwatch: if he can sell the other shit too he might take some
[8:49:36] OriginalGibsta: plus the materials NODDERS
[8:50:27] IvyOlive: so -$600 a batch if you pay $50 per water
[8:51:27] TastyKudzu: honestly buying all you can and cooking even if it's just break even or a slight loss is pretty good right now. Just get more and more data and record it and eventually you'll solve for 100%
[8:51:37] zer0cool1138: I think it would be interesting to look at building the compounds into a formula. Like "hu¬≥wz¬≤"
[8:53:00] TastyKudzu: even with 100,000 possibilities if you do enough cooks, even if it's a really complex system, you can solve it. So cooking more and recording the outcome is always good.
[8:53:45] CyanMig: imagine if the fruit and bread broke down into garbage bags, jackpot
[8:54:39] zer0cool1138: Yeah I agree @tastykudzu  it looks like alot of players are assuming above average is locked behind a mechanic and isn't in the recipe
[8:55:41] ridarizam: just played tekken for 8 hrs straight, goodnight yall

[8:57:02] catloafjr: EZ
[8:57:03] jedimindtricks82k: harryRAT
[8:57:15] Sword_Scream: 68 per ingredient, and you need 6 water, 3 of each other ingredient. That's 15 ingredients
[8:57:21] Sword_Scream: That's... 1020 for a batch
[8:57:27] Sword_Scream: Rat king is delulu
[8:57:31] cliffscorner: just don't do it with tony 80% of his runs end in scuff

[11:42:19] No_Sneezing: only 1 has 2 Capitals
[11:42:26] PaganHeart: Could be, but might have more to do with pairs, and which positions are primary might influence what secondary positions are better
[11:42:40] PaganHeart: that's how I'd program it anyway
[11:42:45] ichijazz: After seeing some ones setup I can no longer comment
[11:43:08] searlesbarkleyk: Norah Jones lol..
