[0:47:34] Retro_Crisis: I find it, along with other sports that I am not super into, is a pretty good social event.
[0:47:35] MyNameisTiff_: I enjoy that it's a single game rather than a series.

[0:50:01] TheHungryEntry: My team isn't playing   falcons but oh well  if things happen that are being said they will be good again someday
[0:50:15] laxwall11: then yeah yellow
[0:50:15] songislands: @Ponscus danke!
[0:50:16] Retro_Crisis: So it's safe to say we're cheering on the Cheifs?
[0:50:28] laxwall11: lol
[0:50:30] doc_sharon: I am rooting for Jason Kelce antics in the stands NODDERS so I will win no matter what KEKW
[0:50:30] AziraphalesShop: katesBlubbers katesGun

[0:50:44] doc_sharon: EZ CLap
[0:50:46] lesscubes: As a Seattleite, this is (a repeat of) the worst superbowl we weren't in. (KC used to be a rival when we were in their conference, and now SF is our biggest rival)
[0:50:46] DirectorStephanie: That's my team this year
[0:50:51] doc_sharon: It's a guaranteed win!
[0:50:57] doc_sharon: Hypee
[0:50:59] laxwall11: Raiders are black and its thier stadium so there you go
[0:51:00] songislands: generally i'm fine with the chiefs, but their fans do the tomahawk chop which is icky
[0:51:00] NotAMachine: Do you have any Taylor merch you can wear?
[0:51:03] mister_nibbles: im just sad that the Ravens offense choked in the playoffs AGAIN
[0:51:04] lesscubes: I can root for drunk Jason Kelce tho
[0:51:08] arbucklezero: Shirt off, helping some young fan enjoy the game
[0:51:08] DirectorStephanie: So do you have any green then, cause that'd be eagles colours. Green and grey/silver
[0:51:13] kangg: is there prop bets on o/u how many close ups of Taylor? lol
[0:51:14] LiveFaust: I sure as hell hope I don't have to go anywhere tomorrow. This city is gonna be wild.
[0:51:14] Tinostar11: as long as the commercials are good
[0:51:24] TheHungryEntry: I cannot remember if teams have been announced  like rugby is or on the day
[0:51:36] doc_sharon: @kangg yes there are
[0:51:45] laxwall11: Brads and Chads
[0:51:46] OutlandAsh: i have her 1989 cardigan and its the most comfiest thing

[0:51:53] doc_sharon: You can also bet on how many times Mama Kelce gets shown Yesyes
[0:51:55] arbucklezero: Women don't talk about Taylor Swift?
[0:52:00] kangg: a Taylor category for betting lol
[0:52:01] LiveFaust: 25 seconds?
[0:52:01] DirectorStephanie: The Steiner Math? katesD
[0:52:06] laxwall11: she was only on for 27 seconds i think
[0:52:06] doc_sharon: average of 42 sec a game
[0:52:06] OutlandAsh: it was like 30 seconds tops
[0:52:11] NotAMachine: Boomer Math
[0:52:11] AdventurousEmma: babies
[0:52:14] Pleasantmsp: I think it was 25 secs
[0:52:20] Alteritus: most of a football game is just standing around waiting for the next play anyway
[0:52:22] Jocke124: does that count how much they talked about her?
[0:52:26] Ponscus: i'd rather see a shot of taylor swift than a replay of a hand off that goes for no gain
[0:52:33] laxwall11: its like .00001% of the TV time
[0:52:34] ijustwanttosellout: Honestly the NFL should pay her for the publicity, I'm german and had never heard of the Chiefs before Taylor Swift katesGiggles
[0:52:38] songislands: specifically men who have profile pictures of them wearing sunglasses in their car
[0:52:48] kangg: complain about the tv timeouts not Taylor lol
[0:52:52] BennieThePlant: It's not like she asks to be shown
[0:52:52] lorddracnor: @songislands KEKW
[0:52:56] LiveFaust: Steph... katesGiggle

[0:53:21] zekefate: LUL
[0:53:27] Count_Nodonora: In a game where the vast majority of people watching are "Bros", I don't get why they'd complain about seeing a pretty woman for "minutes"...
[0:53:28] TheHungryEntry: I'm looking forward to the halftime show
[0:53:35] DirectorStephanie: @LiveFaust 141 2/3rds chance of a Half-Naked Jason!
[0:53:43] doc_sharon: FACTS
[0:53:44] nebbishHeretic: LOL
[0:53:46] nebbishHeretic: true
[0:53:48] laxwall11: There are so many old sport reports talking about how much they love all the new people talking to them about football cuz of her
[0:53:52] laxwall11: True
[0:53:52] carmens: trueee
[0:53:54] IchibaToll: Those dude are there to watch the dudes
[0:53:55] laxwall11: so hot

[0:54:26] songislands: tay tay prints money
[0:54:30] doc_sharon: She's helped get a bunch of new fans watching games NODDERS
[0:54:43] MyNameisTiff_: It's totally normal to cut to celebrities in the audience of pro sports games all the time. They do it in basketball, baseball, and hockey all the time. Taylor just happens to be super famous.
[0:55:05] songislands: taylor just happens to be more famous than football
[0:55:07] Alteritus: ngl, I find the current Taylor fixation very strange; not just because I find that level of fandom bizarre regardless (which I do) but because she's hardly new on the scene but now it seems she's just everywhere rbeeShrug
[0:55:12] hanofearl: people just love to hate her unfortunately katesBlubbers it’s been like that her whole career
[0:55:18] songislands: juzckyk
[0:55:18] Ponscus: that person
[0:55:19] laxwall11: They were so happy about it cuz they love the game and just want more people to love it as well.
[0:55:20] DirectorStephanie: Just watched Julian Edelmann's Last Meal on Mythical Kitchen and he welcomed the new fans. Plus he had his BFF necklace that his daughter gave him for when they went to a Taylor concert.
[0:55:20] mister_nibbles: you-schek
[0:55:23] TheHungryEntry: Taylor is so inclusive and inspiring for people
[0:55:23] songislands: or something similar
[0:55:31] LiveFaust: Juicebox?
[0:55:43] NotAMachine: katesJuice
[0:55:44] Count_Nodonora: Oh, you might have put your finger on the problem there..... maybe the "bros" DON'T want to spend the time watching the superbowl with their wives and daughters. I can see them going "This was my time, why are you disturbing this now"
[0:55:46] DirectorStephanie: Julian Edelman - my favourite player ever and now NFL commentator. <3
[0:55:49] doc_sharon: she does AMAZING custom stuff NODDERS
[0:56:00] doc_sharon: her husband was the BEST hype man Hypee

[1:00:08] Kthanid: Also did it to Ozzy and he put Kanye on BLAST.
[1:00:08] songislands: i don't think taylor really cares about kanye bbirbShrug
[1:00:12] AziraphalesShop: Ozzy Osborne just told Kanye where to stick it
[1:00:15] songislands: nor does most of the world these days
[1:00:17] AlliLovesGiraffes: Capitalizes on negative publicity
[1:00:21] 1Joeysmith: And he sampled ILLEGALLY Ozzy Osbourne's music and many others on his new album it got taken off of iTunes and Spotify.
[1:00:23] Nightbot: Follow Kate on Instagram! instagram.com/kate.ttv
[1:00:27] lorddracnor: yup

[1:01:07] DirectorStephanie: @songislands same. My mid-20s to early 30s are all about his music
[1:01:11] Julianhj1: I miss when Kanye said George Bush doesn't care about black people
[1:01:15] Alteritus: @lorddracnor 🤘
[1:01:19] Retro_Crisis: It's amazing how much business the Super Bowl generates. Like all the businesses that benefit from it.
[1:01:21] jotello10: Same and its so sad because his music is so nostalgic when i was younger
[1:01:25] 1Joeysmith: @doc_sharon he's not at all
[1:01:27] songislands: i just downloaded all of his music illegally so he never sees a dime bbirbCool (this is not recommended)

[1:02:08] Nightbot: ^
[1:02:09] songislands: my beautiful dark twisted fantasy was my favorite album on the 2010s
[1:02:13] lesscubes: I'm pretty sure he's always been bat shit crazy, it just wasn't as evident.
[1:02:14] kristian_fischer: And he's gotten waaaaaaaaaaaay worse over the past few years.
[1:02:40] jotello10: I don't think he was the same person with the same beliefs back then compared to what he is today? idk
[1:02:48] TKO552: i liked him when i was in college well over 10 years ago 808s and heartbreak also good
[1:02:52] Alteritus: wealth and mental illness is a dangerous combo
[1:03:01] TheHungryEntry: Worse then an ex president  I will not say?
[1:03:07] lesscubes: Imagine having a group of people around you at all times that enable whatever dumb shit you say
[1:03:17] fattydelrey: yup
[1:03:23] TKO552: his mom died when he was very young and probably didnt go into mental health check
[1:03:25] snooze__button: I saw him at a high school basketball game last year, his fake "academy" played a local team
[1:03:26] Retro_Crisis: He's got some deep rooted stuff going on.
[1:03:31] kristian_fischer: It's pretty much an open secret that he's sick. And you can't get better without taking the first step yourself. Which he won't.
[1:03:32] laxwall11: correct

[1:06:24] Koufaxmoose32: That immediately gets in my head no matter what katesGiggles
[1:06:26] kristian_fischer: Being trapped in a metal tube with other humans is nasty.
[1:06:28] doc_sharon: cause you are a considerate person, too NODDERS
[1:06:37] Alteritus: people rbeeGross
[1:06:40] doc_sharon: oh no KEKW
[1:06:43] DirectorStephanie: bring it on
[1:06:44] kristian_fischer: YOU? A WEIRDO?
[1:06:45] rustenskurk: Don't worry we knew
[1:06:45] songislands: bbirbEyes
[1:06:47] jotello10: Kate do you still have the HelloFresh code available?
[1:06:49] laxwall11: we already know you are one
[1:07:14] songislands: is there anyone in this chat who ISN'T a weirdo?
[1:07:14] doc_sharon: that's fair
[1:07:18] laxwall11: its the worst
[1:07:21] lorddracnor: I feel that
[1:07:21] flathaed: 100% agree to that
[1:07:24] MyNameisTiff_: I feel that.
[1:07:25] doc_sharon: people lose all sense of common decency there NODDERS
[1:07:25] TheHungryEntry: Agree
[1:07:29] Retro_Crisis: It's a super uncomfortable situation
[1:07:29] aideenx98: I have to ignore them
[1:07:31] kristian_fischer: They turn from individuals into a mob and IQ and consideration TANKS.
[1:07:33] Pleasantmsp: understandable
[1:07:34] DirectorStephanie: and as you should be
[1:07:39] jotello10: I guess you don't drive huh KEKW
[1:07:41] lorddracnor: People need to follow the rules, get in the metal tube and STFU
[1:07:41] lesscubes: no thats legit
[1:07:48] Count_Nodonora: You're not weird for that. Airport security has been designed to make everyone's life miserable and boarding attracts the stupidest behaviors.
[1:07:53] doc_sharon: people in those lines lose like 50 IQ points for some reason
[1:07:56] TheHungryEntry: I hate people on a plane that put luggage  in your row when the sit at the back of the god dam plane
[1:07:57] lesscubes: people STOP BEHAVING at the airport specifically
[1:08:02] laxwall11: nothing else makes it really clear that we are still animals then that
[1:08:02] Retro_Crisis: Just like driving. lol
[1:08:05] kristian_fischer: "The Oxford Dictionary defines "drooling idiots" as..."
[1:08:10] jotello10: driving is 1000% more rage than any airport human interactions
[1:08:14] doc_sharon: People IGNORE the rules
[1:08:16] garaboldi75: if you drove daily, you would have that feeling daily about humanity
[1:08:17] MyNameisTiff_: It's why I pay for the weird extras to sit at the front of a plane and TSA pre-check. So I can get through all that as fast as humanly possible.
[1:08:20] jotello10: true!
[1:08:25] KillerK0605: Yay, Kate is back 🙂
[1:08:27] doc_sharon: they think the rules do not apply to them for SOME REASON katesNo
[1:08:29] Tinostar11: shoes pff
[1:08:33] Tinostar11: off
[1:08:36] lorddracnor: YES

[1:08:41] Thorn104: the standing thing before being alowed to
[1:08:41] kristian_fischer: Laptop computor? Never heard of it.

[1:09:44] doc_sharon: it takes me longer to put my shoes back on NODDERS
[1:09:55] laxwall11: but i need my 7 different full bottles of liquids Kate lol
[1:09:58] songislands: also "taking off your jacket and/or belt" should not take any time

[1:10:32] kay_bs0919: on my way to Hawaii last year I had a man lean so far into my seat to reach the over head bin that I could have turned my head and bit his dick off I was appalled and physically wretching. My husband nearly screamed at him to back the f up katesPalm

[1:10:52] KillerK0605: Whenever I travel, I just wear crocs

[1:11:11] aideenx98: Its amazing
[1:11:12] doc_sharon: she angy katesMadge
[1:11:15] traviebear: As someone else who use to travel for magic the gathering and a deck of cards just shows up as a big black brick on the scanner that some security freak out about and make me open every container I wish it was that easy all the time.
[1:11:17] songislands: katesMadge
[1:11:19] lorddracnor: American TSA seize 18 guns A DAY because people are dumb!
[1:11:24] TheHungryEntry: Kate does it infuriate you when boarding a person puts there luggage in your over head locker when sitting on the back of the plane?
[1:11:34] aideenx98: Stoppppppppp
[1:11:39] aideenx98: Its awfullllll
[1:11:52] med1398: i cant go threw a metal detecter in a airport do to my fake leg
[1:11:52] doc_sharon: it's so bad
[1:11:57] lesscubes: BOARD BACK TO FRONT PLEASEEEEE
[1:11:58] holimoliguacamoli: yup
[1:12:13] songislands: the system for boarding a place is very bad and very broken (anyone else see that one cgpgrey video?)
[1:12:19] songislands: plane*
[1:12:24] doc_sharon: and the entitlement people feel that THEIR carry ons all have to get on the plane with them katesPalm
[1:12:27] Hoocairz: The entire time in an airport I'm having a constant panic attack until I'm sitting at my gate. Then I panic again during on boarding until everyone is seated.
[1:12:29] A_Humble_Wooper: Ooh, that'd be so nice.
[1:12:31] lesscubes: That'd be fine too
[1:12:34] aideenx98: People won't listen to that either KEKW
[1:12:36] lorddracnor: oh my god, they should!
[1:12:38] AdrianC_41: i think United said they’re doing windows first soon

[1:12:47] iisBunny: I’m always window and I’m always LAST. it’s so annoying.
[1:12:48] doc_sharon: I don't want to climb over people
[1:12:49] Hoocairz: Trains are so much better.
[1:12:50] holimoliguacamoli: middle seats are the worst
[1:12:55] sims_elsa: NODDERS
[1:12:57] songislands: funnily enough, southwest's system of open seating is faster than boarding with assigned seats
[1:13:04] willowfennec: outside in makes the most sense for weight balancing too
[1:13:05] KarnEvil: I've never flown anywhere.  so I'm totally lost in these stories of struggles of airports.
[1:13:07] snooze__button: Best boarding I ever had: they let people with NO CARRYONS on first. We all got through the aisle immediately!
[1:13:09] doc_sharon: My fat ass CANNOT squeeze past KEKW
[1:13:11] lesscubes: Southwest is actually the easiest to board that I've experienced
[1:13:11] rustenskurk: There's a fun little CGP Grey video on youtube about how stupid boarding systems are and how they could be better
[1:13:17] MystahRee: Lol just watched the Mythbusters episode testing plane boarding methods
[1:13:22] TheHungryEntry: Priority boarding is a money scam for airplane
[1:13:39] traviebear: Airports (Pearson mostly) is a lawless crazy place.
