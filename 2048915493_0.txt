[0:11:37] Morri89: so the flu shot contains 4 of the main strains. you can still get it, but it's much less symptoms
[0:11:42] Stealthkillah122: The flu jab can make you get the flu too and give you it bad. Thats why my mother refuses it

[0:12:05] NicolaFred: yeah I’ve not had a flu jab this year and I’ve been screwed. you can just go to boots online and make an appointment
[0:12:07] Prollos: the flu jab gives you a mild flu (normally this years strain) so your body is able to fight it off better for the rest of the year

[0:38:37] jojaha: guys assemble, it is 2 for 1 day
[0:38:42] vipslampy15: I still think people should try to abide by the myles style. Play your main like 4 days, and your fun alt once a week for a break. Kinda refreshes you to see different parts of rp.
[0:38:42] Not_Very_Good_Pigeon: Do you have plans for jackie?
[0:38:46] Phosphor83: I've only started watching RP since 4.0 started and GTA RP is surprisingly great to watch I didn't think it would be this entertaining.
[0:38:56] Asterixdx: @One_Nemesis outside of what cornwood wants its currently 1 dept
[0:38:59] JammyHerring1: @Phosphor83 same here
[0:39:08] HenryChase: except Captains, theyve told Cornwood not to bring it up, IC of course LUL
[0:39:10] Chrissy1337: they plan on electing a Sheriff and Chief at some point so there will be multiple departments again

[0:39:18] Poor_Scum: @uhSnow would you give us your take on ocean dumping in RP?
[0:39:18] the_black_hawk_34: man i wished trev never perma gunner man , gunner was the fucking memes esfandLUL esfandLUL esfandLUL
[0:39:20] moodymellow: I think 2 is great but no more, 1 for the north and 1 for the city. Any more may get too much tbh
[0:39:21] Purple_W0lf: any updates on the railroad
[0:39:22] iithum12: jackie is a forex trader
[0:39:25] sobradbro2: jackie snow isnt cop anymore?

[0:40:03] vipslampy15: Are things nominal?
[0:40:03] johnfrumx: what is ocean dumping?
[0:40:04] PD_Linnellenator: I feel like, you seem to have more freedom to adapt your character to cop RP in 4.0 with Albert, rather than carrying Jackie's history around with you
[0:40:04] Asterixdx: theres not many ways to make someone not remember what happened to them outside of ocean dumping
[0:40:15] rittlezzz: @TomatoPhalanges dumping someone in the ocean
[0:40:15] Asterixdx: @johnfrumx dumping a body in the ocean so it is unrecoverable
[0:40:20] RamboSlice: burns Kappa
[0:40:33] Maximilliarn: real role play tbf
[0:40:36] Sovereign_Doom: dude burn was rping as Rick Grinds earlier and he was straight up Rick Grimes

[0:41:05] moodymellow: someone knows too much --.--
[0:41:12] splooshtasticals: extra naughty moves = extra naughty response. Shit happens.
[0:41:13] AlexSamaAU: isnt it any situatin where you are forced to use the respawn button means they mforget the last hour?
[0:41:15] MDM4ever1986HD: I see some new viewers coming into 4.0 and the chathoppers it really bugs me they think it's okay to meta, chat shit to the streamer who they believe is causing the drama
[0:41:17] MattST62SC70: do you know of any good free RP servers we can play and start out on ?
[0:41:18] PD_Linnellenator: Ocean Dumping to send a message that they won't remember... KEKW
[0:41:23] Poor_Scum: @uhSnow just feel like a lot of people resort to ocean dumping in 4.0
[0:41:28] Not_Very_Good_Pigeon: It should be used for a dramatic effect.
[0:41:28] coreobs: KEKW
[0:41:29] HenryChase: Eugene had one, where X and them told him not to sell PC's, then ocean dumbed him, so he went back to selling them cause he forgot LUL
[0:41:34] sobradbro2: like the eugene pc selling situation LUL he got ocean dumped and went back to selling them

[0:52:41] Asterixdx: I am, but theyve already tested on and killed thousands of animals - obv im against the human element I think its being rushed way too fast for $ reasons
[0:52:45] BakinPacman: just hope they cant be hacked monka
[0:52:47] YellowFello: human testing would not start until is was safe, animals get the worst

[2:36:41] Asterixdx: The fact you have to get a licence to drive but not to get a gun that can mow down so many people is NUTS to me
[2:36:42] ForbiddenUK: switzerland have amazing gun control and do it well
[2:36:46] Hi_Im_Whitefire: Depending on where you live in the U.S, Texas you don't need one, Illinois I need to get approval and background checks to buy, there's also a whole separate ID for it
[2:36:47] curvyllama: @vipslampy15 LOL
[2:36:49] joshua_hickcox: Agreed.i am armed patrol in USA
[2:36:49] SneakyFoxtrot: You don't need a license in most states. You need a license to conceal carry.
[2:36:50] JammyHerring1: My brother in law owns a gun shop in my town, with a range. They have a bucket up front for people bringing in guns with one in the chamber, its full. Big mistake
[2:36:54] azmer1987: @curvyllama interesting Texas js basically its own country at this point
[2:36:59] MadManBehindWheel: 12 bore Kreygasm
[2:37:00] itsgettinmessi: I've shot a good number of guns, never found it too much fun. Enjoy collecting swords and cutting with those more

[2:37:21] ProNooblet: LUL
[2:37:23] curvyllama: another wild thing in Texas. they passed a law where you can carry with it a license!
[2:37:25] nathalas_: so do u own one >"<
[2:37:28] vipslampy15: @curvyllama what stops you from just like selling it? Is it that easy? Other than morals ofcourse LUL
[2:37:30] Bimzie: before 9/11 there were $250 AKs at gun shows. hundreds to choose from. then they all disappeared and prices bave been going up ever since.
[2:37:35] curvyllama: so you just can have a gun on your hip with zero license
[2:37:36] Hi_Im_Whitefire: Some places allow you to open carry without licenses
[2:37:39] l33tSandman: Trousers = Pants.  Bore = Guage, chat haha
[2:37:41] nathalas_: idk im asking
[2:37:47] MadManBehindWheel: YEP
[2:37:50] azmer1987: Tell chat yes
[2:37:57] Solidknight2112: I have a conceal carry, and they take gun safety VERY seriously when you go through the class.
[2:37:57] MICKMOUCHE: central cee
[2:37:58] GuardMoony: Hunters and such need a place to practice of season and before they get the license. So you will find a range in any country
[2:38:04] DanLGG: I live in Ky. I have a Glock on my hip and have no license.
[2:38:07] l33tSandman: lol I'm picturing a 12 Pig Shotgun now God Bless you Snu
[2:38:08] Mocefus: In Tennessee you have to take an 8 hour class to open carry
[2:38:16] hpc_young: you can have a 0.22 rifle lol
[2:38:18] JayyJayy31: its the same over here in Australia
[2:38:18] curvyllama: @mocefus wow

[2:38:30] jamessonjewmcgee: uhnGiga
[2:38:30] Hi_Im_Whitefire: For Conceal Carry, most places you have to take a 16 hour course (2 days) then about a 3 month waiting period for the licnese
[2:38:32] AnalgesicPM: Just move to that town from Hot Fuzz- problem sorted
[2:38:35] l33tSandman: What but if you call Guage as Bore than how do you say Double Barrell?
[2:38:35] Rajike: doesn't UK have antique laws for older guns that makes it easier?
[2:38:35] Emaykurrz_: Good.
[2:38:36] Stealthkillah122: You can own guns in the uk its just stupid strict. You need the gun cupboard    linked to the police Station. Need the the gun and ammo in separate rooms  too
[2:38:38] evil_bullett: that sound about right
[2:38:41] MadManBehindWheel: I can go to Mississippi and get one on my lunch break KEKW @uhSnow
[2:38:43] Sneaky194: thats good
[2:38:45] azmer1987: Open to conceal carry are two opposite ideas with separate rules is very interesting
[2:38:45] ByronLZA: Took me 8 months in South Africa to get my conceal carry license.
[2:38:50] curvyllama: god. I WISH Texas did that
[2:38:56] JammyHerring1: I feel like 85% of people that carry know how to handle, then the 15% like to show off and dont know how to properly carry
[2:38:56] solid_swede: Still easier than getting an assessment for autism. That's 4-5 years.
[2:38:57] curvyllama: SOME sort of regulation lol
[2:39:01] SneakyFoxtrot: @MadManBehindWheel Lies!!! I'm from MS you can'

[2:39:37] DanLGG: yeah I like UKs gun policy it’s just to late for the US to go that route. Everyone has guns

[2:57:29] another0ut: Let's go HASS
[2:57:30] MartMonster: I hope haas and williams are good
[2:57:31] vnxshh: I just want to watch a season where I dont have to pretend 2nd place is 1st to enjoy it because max is 10 seconds ahead after 2 laps
[2:57:32] Halik_TG: @Shoukaku_ijn first is the 5th last is 15th
[2:57:33] azmer1987: Nascar Kappa :)
[2:57:35] joe01522: max could probably win in fiat 500
[2:57:37] lord_dragox412: bleedPurple
[2:57:39] crazyredneck118538: and nascar is better then f1
[2:57:44] Halik_TG: @Halik_TG sorry 2nd
[2:57:47] Shoukaku_ijn: @Halik_TG ah cool
[2:57:50] Hellnolf: KEKW
[2:57:51] Volt_L3GACY: I'm hoping to see Mclaren come out hot to continue their success from last season
[2:57:53] Asterixdx: @Asterixdx yeah what @Halik_TG said
[2:57:53] Forser: Haas will be last until they are sold or give up
[2:57:53] StephyFace: lmao
[2:57:58] MadManBehindWheel: F1 is better because of the technical development that happens
[2:57:59] mikesaysno: @crazyredneck118538 SURE
[2:58:11] Asterixdx: I want oscar piastri to do well this year so bad
[2:58:13] Shoukaku_ijn: im a mclaren girl so lets gooo landoo and pisatri
[2:58:16] McWarfy: Thats awesome!
[2:58:17] JammyHerring1: damn thats badass
[2:58:20] SaintjimmyTV: I just wanna see Lando win a race. is that too much to ask?
[2:58:22] azmer1987: Kreygasm
[2:58:24] MadManBehindWheel: I want Williams to win one PepeHands
[2:58:28] getcarter80: @asterixdx they spent hours welding the manhole covers on the street so they wouldn't come off like it did underneath Sainz car
[2:58:40] KnightsWhoSayREE: Gladge Its all about Aston Martin this year
[2:58:46] KnightsWhoSayREE: COPIUM
[2:58:50] S1RVEL0: your dad knew what hosted means
[2:58:50] FlGJAM: proud dad moment lol
[2:58:52] IXICaptainIXI: I'm a Lewis fan, but I would love for it to be competitive for sure.
[2:58:52] Shoukaku_ijn: no
[2:58:54] MadManBehindWheel: No
[2:58:55] Hellnolf: Nah Alonso is still here
[2:58:55] McWarfy: no
[2:58:56] StreamElements: The new merch is here PogChamp Check it out: https://merch.streamelements.com/uhsnow
[2:58:57] Forser: Lando will get a first place this year for sure, McLaren has worked a lot on this years car.
[2:58:58] JammyHerring1: was that stewie griffin?
[2:59:02] Asterixdx: @getcarter80 oh thats what you mean - yeah I mean thew issue was that the structure they welded to wasnt secure enough, which wouldnt have been missed if it wasnt a massive rush imo
[2:59:08] S1RVEL0: hip dad.  respect
[2:59:08] MadManBehindWheel: Stroll needs to get his shit together KEKW
[2:59:09] jackyboii: I'm a redbull fan but i just like f1 overall
[2:59:09] jonondiscord: Putting the ass in aston martin
[2:59:12] getcarter80: Nope still driving
[2:59:19] Shoukaku_ijn: i hope lewis can take the fight to max this season
[2:59:19] Hellnolf: Id love for Lando to win a race this year, hes been doing so well.
[2:59:23] SaintjimmyTV: Lando had a contract extension as well
[2:59:23] Asterixdx: I want the fight to be Max/Lando/Piastri so bad
[2:59:45] RadiantOrbit: It’s just boring
[2:59:47] Hellnolf: If its just another Red Bull white wash it'll be a snoozefest
[2:59:49] JammyHerring1: I dont watch racing, maybe indy 500 bc its close.
[2:59:51] mikesaysno: i agree 100%
[2:59:52] Shoukaku_ijn: is logan sargent still at hass?
[2:59:54] fatwookiee: great take
[2:59:55] Asterixdx: Max is just addicted to driving. Dude is in iracing within an hour or two of a race ending
[2:59:55] MadManBehindWheel: We want 2021 back Madgeclap
[2:59:57] S1RVEL0: like the hamiton / max fight where the refs gave the chapionship to max?
[2:59:59] jackyboii: yeah i get that but merc won 4 and then 3 in a row so there need to be something
[3:00:05] Chrissy1337: sure but if he is the best driver in the best car
[3:00:07] AlexE42600: tbs I switched off last year become predictable same old bore fest
[3:00:16] getcarter80: Supposedly, Mercedes rumor is the W15 is ready to compete
[3:00:18] dianite_403: i watched lewis win back to back to back. i dont mind watching max do it. 2021 we were spoiled. but i miss head to head racing for a win
[3:00:21] Shoukaku_ijn: no we want the V8 or V12 engine back
[3:00:22] jackyboii: LUL
[3:00:23] Comis19: sadly I don’t see many changes until the new engines in 2026
[3:00:25] mikesaysno: KEKW
[3:00:30] Asterixdx: "toto, we went car racing"
[3:00:35] GordoUK: the drama
[3:00:36] MadManBehindWheel: They still didnt follow the rules
[3:00:38] Hellnolf: We didnt go motor racing though did we Madge
[3:00:40] sietze50: thats an very good masi impression xD
[3:00:40] twymanos: I'd just like Checo to have a decent season
[3:00:52] AlexE42600: ironic that happened when Netflix were filming LUL
[3:00:53] azmer1987: I only know Alexander rossi NAPA team lol
[3:00:59] joe01522: not like this michael
[3:01:03] MadManBehindWheel: They stop TP from contacting the FIA RD @uhSnow
[3:01:04] Shoukaku_ijn: rb isnt bad team the issues horner
[3:01:11] FlGJAM: Raven#43
[3:01:14] NukeTheJukebox: ello ello
[3:01:16] SaintjimmyTV: despite what you think of the outcome of the 21 season it was awesome to watch right down to the last race. I was at silverstone when Max went into the barrier
[3:01:21] MadManBehindWheel: I did
[3:01:27] NukeTheJukebox: good man, how are you
[3:01:30] jackyboii: I'm waiting for audi
[3:01:32] S1RVEL0: i thought it was absolute shit and i stopped watching f1 after it
[3:01:39] Forser: they disallow direct contact with  race director, teams can contact assistants which will relay it to race director
[3:01:41] vnxshh: I think the decision making was awful and they didnt follow the rules themselves
[3:01:43] Comis19: I did, only because it didn’t follow the rules and let all cars through
[3:01:44] AlexE42600: it doesn't just happen at F1, look at everything down to grass routes there are huge controversial decisions
[3:01:45] MadManBehindWheel: Cope
[3:01:45] Asterixdx: They should have made the unlap descision immediately and for all drivers, not the weird shit they did imo
[3:01:47] Hellnolf: Personally i thought it was a bad decision
[3:01:48] Halik_TG: @SaintjimmyTV it was a moment we all thought he was not getting out but glad he did even as a Ham fan haha
[3:01:50] Shoukaku_ijn: it was a travesty massi made a mistake letting that rb go when it did
[3:01:58] JammyHerring1: lol
[3:01:59] Leviwest: @uhSnow i think it was shit as much asi  did like the race betwen ham nad ver butthe ret ofthe grid someo f them were 50 seconds back when the race started more positions could of changed not just max ver
[3:02:00] NukeTheJukebox: dude the tracking footage was the best yet
[3:02:00] ssarmi: Snow Do you recall Montoya vs Schumaher era?
[3:02:02] Chrissy1337: the thing is Snow, in the end i want the best driver to win and if thats Max its Max
[3:02:09] dianite_403: should be consistant but a race should always end under green flag running
[3:02:12] BluGiant: I did stop watching after that. just seemed very very weird…
[3:02:16] zap_rowsdower_42: but finishing under yellow is cringe
[3:02:26] AlexE42600: Bose appreciated toto launching his headphones a few times Kachiing
[3:02:29] Shoukaku_ijn: @Chrissy1337 literally anyone but max will be a golden race
[3:02:36] azmer1987: Waiting for DeLorean to make a v10 c10
[3:02:42] Asterixdx: Oh for sure was done for entertainment/news purposes lmao. Everyone can argue that Hamilton/Verstappen wouldve won without some of their crashes but stuff happens
[3:02:45] SaintjimmyTV: @Halik_TG You never want to see a driver hurt regardless of who you support
[3:02:46] dianite_403: if lewis pitted for softs like max did. we woulnt be talking about the dicision
[3:02:49] MadManBehindWheel: But it would have been with in the rules NODDERS
[3:02:53] Comis19: they should have just red flagged it and restarted. knowing the situation
[3:03:02] bqnaan: the thing is though, technically masi didnt break any rules. It was only some time until AFTER the race the FIA modified the rules so that it wouldnt happen again, which means masi did it within the rules. Thats just how i see it though
[3:03:06] S1RVEL0: @dianite_403 lewis had no chance of pitting from what i remember
[3:03:16] ratmcfink: Get rid of cars unlapping and problem solved, plus way faster SC
[3:03:21] Chrissy1337: like if it was just the car Perez would have been second every race
[3:03:25] jackyboii: I paid £479 for my silverstone ticket and it's going to be worth it
[3:03:26] azmer1987: Need Nascar caution rules Kappa
[3:03:31] Forser: Only one to blame over Max winning are the other teams not being able to make a car that can compete with Red Bull. That’s not Max fault.
[3:03:34] dianite_403: @S1RVEL0 Lewis hadnt past the wrecked car yet. still had time to react seeing a car in the wall. but i dont think the team could have decided in that time
[3:03:40] Asterixdx: Not just the car, he spends more hours driving than anyone else. He literally is racing most of the time hes awake
[3:03:41] Volt_L3GACY: I think if you put max and lando in identical cars, lando gives him a run for his money
[3:03:47] SaintjimmyTV: Put Lando, Max and Ham in the same car and i think we'd have an awesome season
[3:03:54] RoohyCrossing: ooo my specialist subject :3
[3:03:54] Hellnolf: That red bull is insane, but as Chrissy1337 said, if it was JUST the car why wasnt Perez second every race.
[3:03:56] StreamElements: The new merch is here PogChamp Check it out: https://merch.streamelements.com/uhsnow
[3:03:58] S1RVEL0: @dianite_403 makes sense
[3:04:03] azmer1987: 1060 pogg
[3:04:03] getcarter80: But than why did Checo have so much trouble if Redbull is so good...
[3:04:14] getcarter80: Yeah 😝😝😝
[3:04:29] lord_dragox412: monkaS
[3:04:33] joe01522: monkaS
[3:04:38] Asterixdx: @Hellnolf exactly. the car may be developed for his driving style, but Perez' season is proof its not a slam dunk to just have a good car
[3:04:41] Forser: @hellnolf Checo ain’t that solid.

[4:23:00] SurfaceMC: btw fivem uses chrome/chromium to render ui so you're basically looking at a web page overlayed on top of the game. i dont think it's possible for the server to cause ui freezing since ui is rendered client side. if there were server side issues, the ui would still load all the static info (which your client obtained upon joining the server), but it would be missing all the dynamic stuff (like mdt report contents). anyway, server lag doesnt generally cause a page to freeze client side

[4:29:07] reesespieces17: I do consider RP an artform. It's writing (even in voice) and working in tandem with as many people that are in a scene or associated scenes, to create a story. It's a dance working together. SOmetimes it's magical, sometimes it's complete fail. But isn't that what makes it an art?
[4:29:53] BluGiant: HUH 󠀀
[4:30:08] azmer1987: @reesespieces17 lol too deep. Its like improv comedy
[4:30:32] Juan_Mortiz: Don't you think that because of the low population of the server, police perception is biased and way more intelligent than in reality because unconsciously you already have preconceived knowledge when you are dealing with someone or something. Maybe a good way to balance it is to intentionally look more dumb.
[4:30:47] vnxshh: jesus what is it with the gcse english essays

[4:47:02] Chrissy1337: it basically said "you should let my streamer win more"
[4:47:05] Juan_Mortiz: It was a more general remark it wasn't about that situation. Sometimes some good runs are ruined because of some silly and it makes it less fun that's it. Entertainment is key not realism.
[4:47:26] Chrissy1337: someone was behaving suspiciously so yes its totally normal for a cop to look into it

[4:50:41] Cinn7624: You don't have to defend your rp
[4:50:44] Chrissy1337: like i dont get the idea here, if a person tries to get to a certain spot over and over again ina stolen car, cops should look the other way?
[4:50:50] EmrysorMerlin: @jonasindenmark so it now has a laser gun?
[4:50:52] khlaah: Crims need good PD, so that the crims keep interest and entertainment, same as how PD needs the crims to be good for the interesting interactions and entertainment, it's all about the GOOD RP, which has been going on since day 1.
[4:51:12] Chrissy1337: mistakes are also part of the RP though
[4:51:29] JonasInDenmark: @EmrysorMerlin Thats sadly illegal in Denmark KEKW or atleast very heavily regulated
[4:51:29] blackmoofou: If the Crim makes a mistake though that's on them and that's all part of it
[4:51:30] khlaah: @Chrissy1337 100000000%
[4:51:47] RetroGravy: with choices come consequences
[4:51:49] ArenaKrusher: I mean crims will make plans, but other players and/or cops will react to those plans and it will have to be changed, its rp

[4:52:11] TheShaunBro: Sometimes mistakes can be good and you get great RP out of it
[4:52:16] Dinguz: I'd just go watch a movie if I wanted fully scripted roleplay, I actually really like the randomness of every situation that you all provide uhsLove
[4:52:17] Vinmir: It's all about situational context
[4:52:22] Juan_Mortiz: both. Veterans need to control the beginners more. I don't know how it can do it but sometimes it's become a battle of egos. I'm not trying to be negative or something  it's just a remark
[4:52:26] thermalnemisis1: The crazy thing is all the best scenarios happen when random interactions happen, ie a cop spotting a crim on a run, without cops ur just watching people grind on a server.
[4:52:36] blackmoofou: I don't know what happened anyway
[4:52:41] erika_hubbs: Good take
[4:53:02] azmer1987: Pulling back lol sorry. You didn't ask me
[4:53:13] khlaah: Bout to be an officer down lol
[4:53:35] Wynter282: even with scripted stuff the ending of breaking bad would have been pretty lame if walter didnt make mistakes and get found out
[4:53:39] jessielight: that emulates RL in so many ways
[4:53:40] Sempathyy: 4.0 so far is nothing but grind so far, for everybody, theyre just taking the start slower that way its not just insta mag dump and holdouts every 3 hours

[4:54:06] Juan_Mortiz: I'm just generalizing
[4:54:14] beastmodeup: i cant stand watching civs grind jobs all day.. i like cops and wild cards like chatty and extraemily more entertaining
[4:54:19] reesespieces17: absolutely the random turn out the best. I had a character I RP'd for 14 years. One random interaction and the only way to go was to perma that character.
[4:54:20] jessielight: unexpected events, running into people ect
[4:54:21] TheShaunBro: A good RP'r can roll with the randomness and all involved get something positive out of it
[4:54:52] MonosOG: I think people are upset that stories that have built up over time unraveled too quickly when sometimes that just happens. Its very rare, even in RP, that a story is gonna go perfectly in the viewers eyes
[4:54:58] blackmoofou: I only watch afro, Kyle and snow from time to time for the cop angle I don't like to know what's going to happen
[4:55:19] blackmoofou: And Kyle is on another server so that doesn't count
[4:55:37] Akumaunit00: I like sour cream on my tacos
[4:55:42] BoatMagee: Im a bit on both sides, some grind is good but the end of 3.0 was just all car chases and explosions.
[4:55:44] thermalnemisis1: Watching new people RP has been one of the great tings about 4.0.
[4:55:48] blackmoofou: Oh yeah Kyle is brilliant
[4:55:56] azmer1987: Sour cream on tacos good. Sucks anywhere else

[5:15:00] Lepakko: I feel nobody. Both have too much anti-air
[5:15:01] EmrysorMerlin: Neither it very ground based atm
[5:15:06] lenny1287: No one
[5:15:07] thejerrow: Pilots are being trained
[5:15:07] Havesomelove: 2025?
[5:15:10] SR_Ninya: they are training right now
[5:15:12] FearUS_28: still in training I think
[5:15:13] khlaah: this year
[5:15:14] trippinleftyHD: towardsa summer
[5:15:16] cooking4mama: not enough f16s are being sent to give superiority
[5:15:17] hugoorm: Nah we have Ukraines training in denmark
[5:15:18] FlGJAM: I think they are training yeah
[5:15:19] TheShaunBro: yeah
[5:15:31] ShaneOwens0: oh wow
[5:15:32] thejerrow: They won't have enough F16
[5:15:34] degeneratehermit: Doubt
[5:15:37] khlaah: the first few should be coming in theatre in probably 3 months or so
[5:15:37] vnxshh: off you go Kappa
[5:15:38] Damonoxide: air to air, probably Russia.  But Ukraine has a lot of anti-air options
[5:15:44] hpc_young: So snow is going to be a fighter pilot when his drafted
[5:15:50] Leviwest: @uhSnow scary fact is AA is very aadvanced flying a plane would be very scary
[5:15:52] azmer1987: LUL
[5:15:57] hpc_young: no
[5:15:57] JordonPick: you seen the clip of the two fighter pilots talking shit to each other after they shot each other down
[5:15:58] khlaah: no @uhSnow
[5:16:02] killscripts: the new electronics and jammers on an F16 will take care of things
[5:16:06] TheShaunBro: not in a turning fight
[5:16:06] fbrenha: They wont reach a dog fight tho
[5:16:09] trippinleftyHD: it depends on the pilot I would say
[5:16:13] viewgalaxy: to many anti aircraft systems to have benefits of aircraft fighting
[5:16:16] thejerrow: If the F16 pilots know what they're doing they'll win
[5:16:17] khlaah: the f-16 will be a game changer in favor of Ukraine
[5:16:17] SID84: dogfighting is not the issue, they are ultra rare
[5:16:18] AfroAltruism: depends, don't F16s have longer range
[5:16:21] newby_lt: Depends on how stripped down the F16s are that are provided
[5:16:23] StevenB79: they are supppose to be defensive aren't they
[5:16:23] AetherMana: im pretty sure the forums of that same game will tell you the info you need from leaked documents LUL
[5:16:26] Winston_Moriarty: after watching things that ISIS did I think I'm a bit desensitized to all this stuff
[5:16:28] EmrysorMerlin: Shame the UK got rid of all our tornadoes
[5:16:29] WonkeyDisco: you flown the eurofighter typhoon yet?
[5:16:29] CulturedPork: RU doesn't use IFF
[5:16:32] lenny1287: Close range F16 for sure
[5:16:32] amber_bijoux: don’t say that too loudly.. the government is listening and they will make you fly a plane
[5:16:42] SwitchBord001: dog fights aren't really a thing anymore.
[5:16:44] vnxshh: @Winston_Moriarty same here, seen some fucked up shit in them videos
[5:16:48] TheShaunBro: doesn't the weapons the F-16 can field have better standoff range?
[5:16:56] Matosere: man screw russia
[5:17:06] thejerrow: Most fights are BVR i feel like now a days
[5:17:14] jaxxhavick: The F-35 Lightning II will beat any Russian MiG hands down
[5:17:15] beakyreaps: NODDERS
[5:17:15] Kenderssss: right
[5:17:20] ben0809: nodd
[5:17:23] ArenaKrusher: a bad cock YEP
[5:17:23] SirTylerAlot: bends to the left cock
[5:17:26] azmer1987: Damn jets are so insane watching fly
[5:17:29] newby_lt: F-16s provided warnings of potentials snipers to ground forces when I was in Afghanistan so they have alot of capabilities
[5:17:30] Matosere: nah most of the russian population backs him its disgusting.
[5:17:30] BluGiant: cock YEP
[5:17:31] viewgalaxy: dude is a psychopath
[5:17:34] vnxshh: small and bent cock, just useless
[5:17:37] khlaah: Fuckin Putin and the Kremlin, they have fucked up Russia since the 1900's
[5:17:38] lenny1287: I'm amazed how much firepower an F16 can carry
[5:17:40] Trawls421: the type of cock with gonorrhea
[5:17:40] kerndeezy: DIDSOMEONESAYCOCK
[5:17:44] Nikez: @jaxxhavick in BVR, yes, but in a dogfight? no chance.
[5:17:45] Seanisms: Wouldn't the use of F16's increase the potential activity of SU-57's ?
[5:17:47] StevenB79: I'm sure those won't end up on black market
[5:17:57] thejerrow: Y'all remember the Ghost of Kyiv legend?
[5:18:05] AfroAltruism: I agree, F the Russian government as a whole. the people are somewhat complicit but they can only do so much
[5:18:15] ArenaKrusher: well he just jails all his opponents so EZ win
[5:18:31] TheShaunBro: 3
[5:18:39] khlaah: Russia can't even afford to use their T-14's in combat lol
[5:18:42] the_oracie: 5 and 3 probably don't even work
[5:18:47] jaxxhavick: @Nikez Even in a dogfight the F-35 is the most advanced fighter jet in the world
[5:18:48] Leviwest: didnt ukriane blow up 1 or 2 ?
[5:18:53] azmer1987: Russia has some insane shit though. They have missiles we can't counter
[5:18:55] trippinleftyHD: Russia is a paper tiger
[5:18:56] StreamElements: The new merch is here PogChamp Check it out: https://merch.streamelements.com/uhsnow
[5:19:00] FearUS_28: can't even form a singular air wing  LUL
[5:19:04] lenny1287: @Seanisms I doubt Russia will put an SU-57 even close to Ukraine. The embarrassment of one getting shot down would be too much
[5:19:07] EmrysorMerlin: @nikez true also depends on location
[5:19:12] thejerrow: I'm still upset about the AN225
[5:19:14] Nikez: @Nikez KEKW it's okay bro
[5:19:17] AfroAltruism: are you sure? im pretty sure one was hit at least recently
[5:19:17] viewgalaxy: their equipment is for looks and to scare not actually usable
[5:19:28] Seanisms: That is a fair point tbh, if an SU-57 gets shot down it'd be all over the news tbh
[5:19:29] azmer1987: Pause
[5:19:29] Kenderssss: lmao
[5:19:34] azmer1987: Lol
[5:19:36] TheShaunBro: I just looked it up and apparently 32 built so have 10 test 22 production aircraft @uhSnow
[5:19:42] Matosere: russia has the most overrated military in the world the only thing stopping they from being invaded is the amount of nukes they posess but what comes into doubt is how many of them are actually ready to use.
[5:19:45] Leviwest: @uhSnow it was on the ground i thnik
[5:19:51] TheShaunBro: no idea
[5:20:12] lenny1287: An SU34 was shot down recently
[5:20:21] mr_crispy: iran is spookier than russia
[5:20:23] ben0809: IFISPEAK
[5:20:27] Seanisms: No the 'SU-57' that was shotdown was propaganda the video was literally from ArmA 3
[5:20:31] hpc_young: Russia is always the same it wins wars by having more bodies then the other side
[5:20:35] azmer1987: I wouldn't call nuclear power over rated and supersonic missiles
[5:20:44] khlaah: yeah 5th or 6th i forget which one
[5:20:49] viper16: su57 stealth jet with visible rivets KEKW
[5:20:53] thejerrow: @Seanisms OH yea i remember the Arma 3 footage going around social media KEKW
[5:21:01] AfroAltruism: okay yh i was wrong, i was thinking of the A-50
[5:21:04] Matosere: yeah no unstable countries should have acess to nunclear weapons its a threat to the human race
[5:21:10] lenny1287: 4.75 gen
[5:21:12] killscripts: Did you know France has the 4th most Nukes in the world
[5:21:15] azmer1987: From u.s. they certainly seem the biggest threat
[5:21:21] thejerrow: Russian military has no structure, its been showing since the beginning of the invasion
[5:21:31] trippinleftyHD: soviet tactics
[5:21:40] beastmodeup: well if even 10 nukes work its a mjor threat
[5:21:42] Kenderssss: my opinion everyone thought russias military was better then it actually was
[5:21:50] ArenaKrusher: nukes are bad m`kay
[5:21:54] Cinn7624: Abort abort
[5:21:55] azmer1987: No solution to that though lol
[5:21:56] Winston_Moriarty: there is no turning back
[5:22:00] fbrenha: brave take KEKW
[5:22:06] azmer1987: No easy solution
[5:22:08] EmrysorMerlin: No country should have em but that never happening
[5:22:20] thejerrow: sadly that will never happen
[5:22:28] khlaah: I agree, and I'm an American combat veteran
[5:22:29] Danacky23: They are only good for Elon Musk who wants to Nuke Mars to build an atmosphere.
[5:22:29] ShaneOwens0: nothing
[5:22:34] evilmnkey4: weapons in general shouldnt exist...
[5:22:35] azmer1987: Mmmm
[5:22:37] ArenaKrusher: in armageddon it saved the human race NODDERS
[5:22:45] Matosere: japan asked for it.
[5:22:47] thejerrow: Nuked a country twice and now we have anime does that count?
[5:22:47] Leviwest: @uhSnow only good thing its a deterrent thats it no 1 can use them without the world ending
[5:22:48] Trawls421: chernobyl was a crazy movie...
[5:22:50] lenny1287: Ended WW2
[5:23:08] EmrysorMerlin: Apparently it wasn't the nukes that got Japan out
[5:23:15] azmer1987: It was awful. But we're rebuilt to highest tech
[5:23:22] Matosere: @EmrysorMerlin it most definitely was.
[5:23:39] thejerrow: @EmrysorMerlin Theres a lot of debate on that still happening, i doubt we'll ever truly know

[5:25:21] Matosere: they withdrawing was a business decision.
[5:25:28] EmrysorMerlin: @chrissy1337 mines not working ....
[5:25:53] thejerrow: @Matosere I believe it was the nukes combined with the soviet union declaring war on Japan
[5:25:54] batperson: drone warfare seems real interesting. everyone's probably working on all sorts of new drone tech
[5:26:24] BluGiant: !prime
