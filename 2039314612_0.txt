[2:46:37] filipe_vasconcellos_: just get someone to rob your truck and then get the 6k divided by 2
[2:46:38] Bruvverbean: he's saying rolls are 5 per
[2:46:40] sreylas: can you open the pallets
[2:47:29] stridro: someone wants chaos
[2:47:32] Bruvverbean: like mac was saying, chop would be 5k per car then
[2:47:57] minnmor: would just sell the pallets then
[2:48:19] minnmor: 1200
[2:48:20] frsttyyy: 1.2k?
[2:48:29] KirkHasselen: 40*30 (1200)*5 = 6k
[2:48:48] frsttyyy: why the x5?
[2:49:08] Bruvverbean: @frsttyyy rolls are 5 per apparently
[2:49:17] Bruvverbean: unconfirmed tho
[2:49:24] frsttyyy: aah ok
[2:49:35] minnmor: thats just stupid if its like that
[2:49:43] Bruvverbean: sell the job to crims OMEGALUL
[2:49:56] KirkHasselen: and take the abandon rep hit..
[2:50:05] Chritters: That'd be interesting
[2:50:06] filipe_vasconcellos_: KEKW
[2:50:13] minnmor: @KirkHasselen i dont think you get hit on your rep anymore if you lose stuff on job
[2:50:43] minnmor: and you guys sold someone a bag yesterday too
[2:50:53] KirkHasselen: ohh tht makes it even more profitable to do it like that.
[2:51:17] KirkHasselen: 3600
[2:51:31] filipe_vasconcellos_: if does lose rep just stay with 1 pallet and finish the job

[3:57:38] ImMcGuirk: is jenny rich since I went out for a bit?
[3:57:47] VoidedZReaper: just another thought, mick forcing the talk shows he's growing aswell
