[1:59:14] mCerti: But there’s a grow cost of $300 that goes to nobody. I think you’re right Harry
[1:59:17] SpilledNuts: @wasdanny they all look up to her right now lol
[1:59:19] Alexilalasismyuncle: number of bags sold is incorrect.  there is loss due to getting caught, jailed, etc.
[1:59:22] Aumilly: !coinflip DinkDonk
[1:59:23] Nightbot: heads
[1:59:23] TwitchesFishBowl: She’s right. Get the total first then subtract cost.
[1:59:23] civlaz: KEKW
[1:59:25] RenTheRock: The bag number or dollar amount logged is off
[1:59:26] sbarnard5: simple for speedy....braindead for everyone else KEKW
[1:59:34] modyobwoc: the grow cost comes out of company funds... Harry shouldn't be paying from his own pocket
[1:59:35] TheWitchAtWoolworths: she has a massive spreadsheet with allll the costs added in
[1:59:36] martymagoo78: she didnt subtracts the seed cost
[1:59:37] JessCee7: The cost of grow is taken from the treasure pile
[1:59:41] ForgetMidnight: of course its heads angy
[1:59:41] fambaa: @martymagoo78 the cut for seed etc is inside the cut for the grower...
[1:59:44] masterr3shi: giver everyone there own storage compartment
[1:59:45] rubano_01: So are Harry's assistants on the growing getting paid as well?
[1:59:47] tsebaka: @martymagoo78 Harry gets the money for ingredients from the treasurer. If not he tells her.
[1:59:50] martymagoo78: no it isnt @fambaa
[1:59:56] perox89: doesa harry get paid for bags not pushed though? i guess not
[1:59:56] LivingManiac: she isnt takeing the seed cost and stuff off before %'s
[1:59:59] bobbybedstains: they just aint mathing up
[2:00:19] OmegamonX: the ingredient cost does not matter
[2:00:19] jshwan: Chatting
[2:00:22] prenzbells: @Alexilalasismyuncle she is not talking about sells.  she is talking about general outputs
[2:00:36] ViableTV: @Nightbot madgeNOW
[2:00:37] roesslerm: Not having Langs number in the computer pushed the average price per bag up
[2:00:37] martymagoo78: she is paying the seeds upfront from the treasurer, but then not taking it out the profits when calculating the cut
[2:00:48] Alexilalasismyuncle: not all 5600 were actually sold.  some were lost.  does nobody realize this???
[2:00:49] TheWitchAtWoolworths: are you all taking into account how many bags were seized by cops?
[2:00:57] Iron_PTMN: PAYDAY INCOMING EZ Clap
[2:01:00] kazumadez: Is arush not calculating bags lost if they got arrested?
[2:01:01] Lepru: buddhaCheer
[2:01:02] TwitchesFishBowl: The payout to growers will be big as well. The growers get 15% of EVERY bag sold. Sellers only get 55% of what they sell.
[2:01:06] AlexanderMichael: Car #3 inc
[2:01:08] allknowing934: would yall just let them handle it and stop doing chat math istg lmao

[2:01:22] postAmongUsist: @Alexilalasismyuncle only si lost ~80 bags iirc
[2:01:24] Alexilalasismyuncle: @thewitchatwoolworths exactly
[2:01:25] wetterberg: chat math vs streamer math, FIGHT!
[2:01:38] wilson060: accountant larpers in chat OhMyPoggies
[2:01:40] modyobwoc: payout should be based on dirty money that comes in, rather than bags sold
[2:01:41] rubano_01: @twitchesfishbowl so when will Marty and Dougie receive their share
[2:01:56] idea_guy: Sayeed how so many catchphrases it's crazy
[2:01:58] jshwan: Chatting my math is right
[2:01:59] ianakaBoogie: LUL
[2:02:10] ViableTV: just gotta sell it to the sellers
[2:02:24] KumiXIV: is the money for growing coming out of the house funds?

[2:02:31] Udeadman: Does Marty get anything?

[2:04:03] rejpendeskejp: lookUp wtf
[2:04:06] shiifon: @tsebaka nah he has to pay the sani works
[2:04:10] wetterberg: @woolsCW and the tolerance to accept the input from everyone like this, holyyy.
[2:04:27] Sablotron: @Berge47 doing that kills "the cost" of the production from each "pie".
[2:04:29] DeadAssYeetOnEm: ye you chillin
[2:04:30] perox89: once its up and running gege will be chillling
[2:04:32] woolsCW: she's what they need for sure
[2:04:32] modyobwoc: does Speedy report dirty cash in or just bags out?
[2:04:33] Aumilly: wasnt sure if Harry knows that or not
[2:04:35] niceuuuuu: arush has made it complicated because hes taking out bags but putting in his depot for the previous set of bags
[2:04:45] ZG3D: @modyobwoc both
[2:04:50] Deathchampt: shes got it
[2:04:52] gadget_t: I don't know gigi's ooc skills, but it's basic accounting
[2:04:54] Lepru: EZ
[2:05:03] searlesbarkleyk: @niceuuuuu how else can he do it...
[2:05:07] zodlez: each step is accounted to prevent potential skimming
[2:05:07] OwGusson: As long it's tracked and the money comes in then it's a easy calculation.
[2:05:07] modyobwoc: @ZG3D ty. Should be all gravy then
[2:05:17] Hogie48: @gadget_t "basic account" is above 99% of peoples skill sets
[2:05:21] wetterberg: @gadget_t WHICH is a STRONG step ahead of the rest of the gang, no disrespect
[2:05:25] searlesbarkleyk: oh they pay for lost bags
[2:05:31] wilson060: PotFriend so tony why weren’t you here
[2:05:37] searlesbarkleyk: good lord pushing weed is dogshit money
[2:05:47] Sablotron: buddha lost it trying to do this exact same thing, and had chatters backseating the shit out of it LUL
[2:05:59] tsebaka: @shiifon @Khaos_The_Lock Its not a linear curve, his gains have been x2 weekly or close to it. after payouts he said to be sitting at 220k + his kick back for materials and sales.. gonna be sitting at 280kish probably. 500k next friday I think is a good bet
[2:06:01] Iron_PTMN: TONY-11K KEKL
[2:06:02] c000ls: lol
[2:06:03] Berge47: @Berge47 If you could make it specific to each revenue stream, you could then apply those cost and splits  more specifically.

[2:07:09] roesslerm: Lang told everyone at the buy in "cont worry if u cant make the meeting" LUL
[2:07:10] wilson060: OMEGALAUGHING

[2:08:39] Oni_mara: Tony always asking to be caught up KEKW
[2:08:53] searlesbarkleyk: Just by the numbers isn't weed turf price paid really screwed up at 17$ per bag? Like pushers are making at most $500/hr... and that's like the ceiling
[2:09:16] Eku007: @bobbybedstains Technically you saying it in chat doesn't do anything Chatting

[2:09:49] Xernique: this is just the first week
[2:09:50] its_ajc: yeah you gotta dumb it down
[2:09:51] niceuuuuu: shouldnt be paying based on bag count, should just be the dirty cash brought in
[2:09:51] woolsCW: that's why she wants the numbers on thursday night
[2:09:51] mCerti: I think it will get more structured in time
[2:09:52] Aumilly: chat try to think if harry would know this info before typing.

[2:10:01] tsebaka: @Khaos_The_Lock hehe, I'm still betting on him beeing close to 500k than 400k. He will be in between 350k and 400k counting the materials in invetorys value after pauing put teddy and cloak
[2:10:02] KrisCat: it's worth suggesting
[2:10:03] SteffyNikel: It's easy if u log it on Thursday
[2:10:05] Iron_PTMN: People just need to give her the numbers PRIOR to the Friday meeting.

[2:10:07] bruHoran: thing will get settled
[2:10:09] UnluckyPhil: for sure, she gonna get cooked
[2:10:09] martymagoo78: so what was the total the crew brought in this week? and what was the profit after all the payouts?
[2:10:10] itskvn__: @searlesbarkleyk Buddha said it is not supposed to be the highest paying crim job.
[2:10:10] niceuuuuu: bag count is for book keeping and checking if someone is skimming
[2:10:10] RedbullYoshi: with spreadsheets its easy lol
[2:10:11] ZG3D: itll work out excel baby
[2:10:12] SpilledNuts: The meeting shouldnt also be the pay time, she can pay on saturday or something and the meeting is friday

[2:30:05] YellsAtLife: 240K for the other house?

[2:35:19] tahoemac: this dosen'tound like tracy chapman, but who knows time might have taken a toll on their voice
[2:35:42] rejpendeskejp: @rejpendeskejp true, boys already did approximate kickbacks weeks back and it was meh
[2:35:58] bromz: the Grammy performance of this song was so insanely good
[2:36:04] sbarnard5: @tahoemac its a crime against the original
[2:36:10] scotty2thotty18: @tahoemac that songs been covered several times
[2:36:17] V01Dwitch: He should have negotiated that before he brought the guns in
[2:36:24] Bealzybub: @tahoemac its a cover by luke combs
[2:36:35] jshwan: @V01Dwitch true tho
[2:36:36] shortsaga: sounds like something the Don's need to talk about
[2:36:46] civlaz: also need to payback cousin
[2:36:55] Panoramic_Views: should be plenty of money you just took out over 200k to buy house
[2:37:00] Panoramic_Views: if that was still there youd be fine
[2:37:01] RainFire2: He's basically selling butc to the crew
[2:37:07] RainFire2: Via gun robberu
[2:37:14] tchai29: harrNom
[2:37:18] scotty2thotty18: Definitely need to increase the prices of everything. Margins are way too thin
[2:37:45] pnwgreg: Hey Harry don't know if you care but kinda cool the Seattle Seahawks just signed the first ever British Born Defensive Coordinator in the NFL.
[2:37:50] me_kNight_: You should pay people based of the money they bring back otherwise you might as well take 400 bags and say you sold them all
[2:38:14] slapch33ks: Make the pushers pay up front for bags at a wholesale price.  Problem instantly solved.
[2:38:20] RainFire2: @me_knight_ then how do the growers/cleaners get paid
[2:38:22] lumpimcdreck: ain't that an issue of the the dons taking care of their pushers?
[2:38:34] scotty2thotty18: @pnwgreg I hope he calls everyone knob heads
[2:38:36] Paupor: There's tax on the power bill? OMEGALUL
[2:38:43] FiniteResources: might as well steal everythin and start a new group Kappa
[2:38:50] Panoramic_Views: also all the other kickbacks are based off money coming in and unless you sell the gun the gun kickback would be pure negative money
[2:38:51] tarzandaking: The pushers should have to buy the bags like 100 bags for say 15 each they sell them at 17.5 something like that
[2:39:12] rejpendeskejp: @Paupor there's also tax on illegal stuff KEKW
[2:39:24] CourageTheCowardIy: hey Harry are you going to try any of the new things people have told you today? like moonshine?
[2:39:59] misfit_justice: gotta keep the cogs turning
[2:40:02] Sword_Scream: I think the "bottleneck" is kinda spread out. People are focusing on legal jobs cause they pay more now, or what pays the most for the least work, and it breaks the balance.
[2:40:05] bananawonka: would be so nice if the app kept track of each ones sales.
[2:40:06] GroundApple: when it happens it's going to be very sudden
[2:40:09] awannii: people shouldnt be working for the kickbacks they need to prioritize crew stuff and get the kickbacks as a bonus
[2:40:16] Ragnogh: but wasn't that only becasue of the house urchase harry?
[2:40:19] Jess17: I know it’s insignificant but also giving away bags to jack then the numbers won’t  add up for Gigi
[2:40:26] sbarnard5: running before you can walk
[2:40:48] OriginalGibsta: new house wasn’t really needed. just needed to transfer your name out
[2:40:50] mCerti: It’s so early in the process though. In a few weeks the account will grow. But it’s literally been a week and 2 days of this process
[2:40:50] jshwan: huge drain on captial
[2:41:06] lumpimcdreck: system needs backup on all positions then it should be fine.
[2:41:09] SpilledNuts: I think it'll feel a lot better next week, it was just a lot this week
[2:41:11] RodzillaSR: Chat what does a brick cost to make?
[2:41:16] scotty2thotty18: All of what you sell needs to go way up in price
[2:41:51] sbarnard5: tax on tax lmfao
[2:41:52] NoQox: tax on tax
[2:42:03] SpilledNuts: bills aren't a tax though, it's a utility bill

[2:42:33] 1994fordexploder: That's vile KEKW
[2:42:43] scotty2thotty18: @sbarnard5 they have been since the beginning
[2:42:44] difficultsleep3r: That should be included in the bill.
[2:43:26] hamsalad7: No way ther's a tax on property tax.
[2:43:41] V01Dwitch: taxes on taxes on taxes
[2:43:56] Sword_Scream: @hamsalad7 Next level government, infinite tax loop.
[2:45:32] Dekiyado: how much was electric bill or Harry not check?
[2:45:49] Dekiyado: that not bad
[2:46:10] Nywro: How many days were 0 though is the thing.
[2:46:11] lumpimcdreck: @Sword_Scream guess this is a real thing by another name
[2:46:12] wtflibelle: Is that monthly or weekly?
[2:46:26] Niktory: monthly
[2:47:12] difficultsleep3r: Big adjustments needed on payouts. The tax is burning through the excess cash.

[2:48:03] TheWitchAtWoolworths: the housing costs come out of the group money
[2:48:07] postAmongUsist: considering this week had a 200k purchase with the house, the system seems to be fine
[2:48:09] GroundApple: octo just blasting this luke combs song, driving fast...
[2:48:15] HHdrummer: harrWiggle harrWiggle harrWiggle
[2:48:19] Niktory: i mean you guys made a near perfect system w top tier communication , youre just low from the house and taxes , need some time to get rolling again
[2:48:28] scotty2thotty18: @difficultsleep3r they need to increase prices. Margins are trash
[2:48:48] TheWitchAtWoolworths: they're not even low they have like 200K in the group fund
[2:49:07] Hollaa1: cleanest cloths in the neighborhood
[2:49:07] normanberlin: I will never not hear "You got the fattest cock"
[2:49:15] weaseljuice84: is there bigger ones or no
[2:49:19] Niktory: @TheWitchAtWoolworths i dont think everything/everyone has been paid
[2:49:29] postAmongUsist: the motel/vu better unlock a new washing method because every1 in the city is running into this problem
[2:49:31] finsane1: this is a Laundromat lol
[2:49:34] ChiefinIt: yea hopefully you can get some bigger washers soon LuL
[2:49:35] CourageTheCowardIy: start buying machines for the don house
[2:49:36] officialqq: Wtf
[2:49:40] quadity2: As a business it's kinda pointless no? Since the VU barely takes a cut now
[2:49:41] 94dave: hahaha we're in the safe
[2:49:42] Ragnogh: Harry did you ever tell lang about that huge cash container you found the other night? might could keep cash off the ground
[2:49:47] Niktory: harry dont insert yourself into the safe
[2:49:48] mCerti: There will definitely be enough cash to kickback though in a couple of weeks though. Just stressful because the account was literally at 0 when the house was bought
[2:49:48] scotty2thotty18: Harry was extra safe
[2:49:50] Niktory: HUH
[2:49:52] TheWitchAtWoolworths: @Niktory who didn't get paid?
[2:49:52] difficultsleep3r: Should just increase capacity rather than keep adding more washers.
[2:50:07] Niktory: @Niktory teddy lang harry and someone else i think
[2:50:17] 7manutd: did they buy laundromat chat?
[2:50:17] sbarnard5: gigi and marty
[2:50:21] Niktory: idk speak to the treasurer

[5:12:17] TheWitchAtWoolworths: gonna be making prison wine with those ingredients
[5:12:57] bimotaracer: Bread is incorrectly thought to contain yeast for the pruno to ferment. Pruno originated in (and remains largely confined to) prisons, where it can be produced with the limited selection of equipment and ingredients available to inmates.

[5:13:35] bimotaracer: It can be made using only a plastic bag, hot running water, and a towel or sock to conceal the pulp during fermentation. The end result has been colorfully described as a "bile flavored wine-cooler".

[5:13:53] bimotaracer: Depending on the time spent fermenting (always balanced against the risk of discovery by officers), the sugar content, and the quality of the ingredients and preparation, pruno's alcohol content by volume can range from as low as 2% (equivalent to a very weak beer) to as high as 14% (equivalent to a strong wine).

[6:06:19] pogi_max: @yahmobethere yeah exactly, maybe its one you shouldnt use. There is probably incorrect chemical compositions in there.
[6:06:23] Fugeki: how many ingredients are there could possible solve it with x amount of samples
[6:06:25] functionalcokeaddict: Huh
[6:06:26] hippiehs: "Harry did you put your baguette in the brewer" Luciano asked calmly
[6:06:28] bennbenn22: do you think the names in the recipe "Nd, qL, etc..." are relevant ?

[6:09:25] tannerrobbz: The smartest thing to do is adjust one at a time
[6:09:34] mnfoxtrot: Starters changed, does the order randomize too? I didn't notice.
[6:09:35] porras1022: Do all letters repeat?
[6:09:35] ShreddedFPS: yeah but what is number 2 then for you when it randomly changes?

[6:10:05] antsinmaheyesjohnson: do a crazy one first then go to baseline

[6:10:46] Thunamin: 1/10,00 dice roll
[6:10:48] antsinmaheyesjohnson: @LongUserNameIsLol oh
[6:10:51] iProOzZ: gotta try random
[6:10:55] DarthRadonis: Hmmm
[6:10:56] rollindarock: I'd also maybe not particular care about the order across because that would be far tooo many options possible
[6:10:57] quote_me_if_horsen: VC is strange

[6:11:11] exo__23: imagine a mini heist or something for clues for the perfect formula
[6:11:14] tannerrobbz: Maybe smart thing to do is collect ingredients and come up with a game plan
[6:11:21] jberg987: Could have been a code at the bar or at the moonshiner?
[6:11:24] yahmobethere: then how do you know what ingredients you need?
[6:11:27] Jess17: what is 2?
[6:11:28] ShreddedFPS: its 10x10x10x10x10 = 100.000 Options

[6:11:53] Gyzmology: we don’t know if there is a way to verify the correct choices though right?
[6:11:53] ShreddedFPS: Chance 1:100.000 to get correct one
[6:11:59] Seosamh22: if nd is one scroll to to the fourth on all as you doing 4 of each?
[6:12:02] rollindarock: It could just be 5 best symbols in the recipe in any order as well though
[6:12:09] Hengarath: Hengarath subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 23 months! 
[6:12:12] da5id_h: @ShreddedFPS if there's only 1 correct option
[6:12:13] nakalimutanko100: i think all is correct its just your product and you are the only one knows the combination of the product
[6:12:16] yahmobethere: @mnfoxtrot are there 5? thought it was corn, bread, water, fruit
[6:12:16] jryan701: yeah interest in the feedback too
[6:12:17] Jords_FPS_HD: You need all Nd to get a base line , then move first to another letter and see if it goes up or down , if it goes up move to the next column and repeat
[6:12:20] socioxxl: Way more than 10 combinations tho

[6:33:32] roesslerm: @bruHoran 40 runs
[6:33:33] tannerrobbz: Oh that stuff yes
[6:33:34] EnLaHora: @bruHoran he made 10k from choping
[6:33:38] BasedBruh: Pawn shop should just be taken out and only deal with dirty money
[6:33:39] r6_ai: house should get less than 30%, they already get the buy ups
[6:33:41] BlacKnight2514: @grimblymcgoo bruh everything has risk KEKW, pushing is lowkey chill now sicne they own all of cypress
[6:33:52] ShreddedFPS: 30% on every action should be on the House, otherwise you guys can never stack money for group things
[6:34:04] koopasetic: are you growing tonight?
[6:34:05] EnLaHora: he made 2k from cleaning 70k
[6:34:16] 9Rux: mos def buddhaJAM
[6:34:18] grimblymcgoo: @BlacKnight2514 neat
[6:34:18] stpotato9: but there isn’t a way to separate weed dirty money from pawn money so the cleaners have to have the same percentage in both processes
[6:34:18] danng: Octo been doing chopn jewelry runs then cleans
[6:34:21] MitchXIII: !song
[6:34:21] Nightbot: The Current Song is Ms. Fat Booty by Mos Def
[6:34:22] tannerrobbz: Cleaner is more so just something that has to be done for the crew
[6:34:25] lamby478: harrWiggle harrWiggle
[6:34:26] OriginalGibsta: yeah he did alot work and really not better than grime
[6:34:28] tannerrobbz: sometimes money isn’t everything
[6:34:30] martymagoo78: anywhere were you can do large values in one run needs to reduce. but people who are bought in need to not get so hung up on personal returns, more needs to go into the crew imo
[6:34:31] zweii22: 10k at 5% he would have to clean 200k
[6:34:33] DrizzleLolz: Octo was saying he could clean 100k a day
[6:34:44] DrizzleLolz: Shruge
[6:34:49] iloverp_: what was your kick back
[6:34:50] KrisCat: @tannerrobbz it is when no one is motivated to do a task
[6:34:50] scotty2thotty18: @grimblymcgoo  pushers don't have all the risk. Harry almost exposed the whole operation growing it.
[6:34:51] roesslerm: 10k is 40 runs 5.7 runs a day sounds a lot
[6:34:52] mohawkdakidd: octo has really stepped up
[6:34:53] socioxxl: Should never have let the pushers of weed get 55% of sales Shpeedy snakin you LUL
[6:34:57] zazmania: it was hilarious nobody had the heart to fine Tony in the mental state he showed up in
[6:35:02] LuciferSpirt: the risk from cleaning/pawn run is way lower then like grow/selling cause of raids tho
[6:35:03] ezionile: they might have overdone the processes a bit
[6:35:04] bruHoran: Octo said he can clean 10k per hour
[6:35:04] jambag00: speedy gave out to tony for making "his own money" LUL
[6:35:08] RenTheRock: Octo is also the best driver in the city
[6:35:15] BasedBruh: @socioxxl bruh, pushers are making $750 an hour at 55%
[6:35:15] coldeveryday: @OriginalGibsta why compare legal and illegal though? grime is mind numbing
[6:35:18] TastyKudzu: Pushers deserve a big cut because it takes so long to push.
[6:35:20] Karnall: @socioxxl nah they were getting like 500 per hour at 40%
[6:35:20] HonourableOne: nah the pushers deserve over 50 for sure it's by far the most time consuming
[6:35:28] Gim0_: 5 k a run but tony and octo said they cleaned 20k each when they told you, and octo said 10k cleaned =1k kickback
[6:35:40] coldeveryday: @zazmania he has been scraping by lmao, bare minimum
[6:35:50] coldeveryday: YEP
[6:36:00] TyrantFPS: 10k is 500 in kickbacks now
[6:36:02] PteradactylJones: the transportation of grown weed from field to base is risky as well
[6:36:13] 1TrueTyrant: You also get paid in advance compared to the rest
[6:36:16] coldeveryday: @PteradactylJones low risk tbf
[6:36:19] tannerrobbz: Yeah I feel like the 15% is fair
[6:36:20] il_capitano91: yea look at SI already got raided for pushing KEKW
[6:36:20] TastyKudzu: The other thing is the more incentivized the pushers are the more you can grow. It actually still benefits you in the end.
[6:36:22] FLASHPOINTSS: fairry
[6:36:23] ShreddedFPS: they changed GTA Literally to Tarkov men KEKW Really nice, scavenging for items, to craft items, HP and Body Parts, broken Bones etc Devs did nice job ratJAM harrRat

[8:35:39] tannerrobbz: There just needs to be trust. I feel like everyone is slowly moving towards bettering themselves now instead of the crew
[8:35:43] EnviousNarwhal: deanWalk
[8:35:47] bruHoran: Then you may as well not have a crew lol
[8:35:47] RodzillaSR: I think it will boil down to your 'CREW" job = give money back "SIDE" Job = directly in pocket.
[8:35:48] Wordbeast: wouldn’t add up and they would be caught by the treasurer
[8:35:52] spudd710: arush not paying for the weed hes pushing but taking the profits basically at that point
[8:36:04] SqueezinWoody: harrLarry
[8:36:17] exo__23: this is such a jp song
[8:36:18] KingDekar: could start selling the weed to pushers
[8:36:20] redemer12: it’s not really about the product but the principal of the situation
[8:36:23] djerbis: i guess people wanna support what they believe in or something
[8:36:23] Xernique: if speedy does that with money from weed sales he is actually stealing from you
[8:36:24] il_capitano91: that is a big fine LUL
[8:36:25] zazmania: so hes taking kick back for money hes not putting in the pot?
[8:36:27] iamwillbur: @spudd710 nah the weed money is seperate to the crew
[8:36:29] ryuudrg: people slowling moving to their own pockets after getting rep benefits 100%
[8:36:33] woulf76: I think controlling turf is going to pay off. I hope it does.
[8:36:38] jellonaut: As long as you've done every step to getting the dirty cash yourself, I guess its not really a problem.
[8:36:50] papas_03: that’s fcked
[8:36:53] niceuuuuu: people getting greedy BibleThump
[8:36:55] difficultsleep3r: Never disrespect Speedy. Guy hard carried the crew for weeks
[8:36:56] Evo_Me: LOL
[8:36:58] Hendrics: matter of time
[8:37:02] tannerrobbz: All money should be going into the crew and he gets a cut like everyone
[8:37:06] argonize: its not all that diff then people doing civ jobs for personal cash though is it?
[8:37:07] Aumilly: RIP DMX
[8:37:08] lyfmobile: @difficultsleep3r yea
[8:37:09] paulaasc: I don't think that's bad
[8:37:10] Dasan_i: Crews breaking apart Sadeg
[8:37:15] iamwillbur: its not fked, its been a thing since day one if you do all the proccesses its yours at the end
[8:37:16] FockerTV: but hes running that all himself on his own to make money,  i think hes sick of senior buns
[8:37:17] iiidannyii: blackh4STEER blackh4JAM blackh4STEER
[8:37:18] Panoramic_Views: no different then Lang selling mats and keeping everything for himself not putting it in the group pot
[8:37:19] SailorWS: who is this?
[8:37:22] jfletcher68: I guess it depends if you want to do the money order thing ornot
[8:37:22] tannerrobbz: If Arush is doing that it sets a really bad example
[8:37:22] lunate87: on average its 30% to the crew right?
[8:37:22] papas_03: should bring it up next don’t meet
[8:37:23] Lepru: peepoJuice
[8:37:26] spudd710: but thats still part of the % breakdown just different avenue at that point right?
[8:37:27] papas_03: don*
[8:37:29] ClckClack: the schnake is back KEKW
[8:37:31] Aumilly: !song
[8:37:32] Nightbot: The Current Song is X Gon' Give It To Ya by DMX
[8:37:32] KrisCat: at this point, a lot of ppl are struggling for money, so it's naturally going to move to that.
[8:37:32] redemer12: that’s fine no? the crew is more for the people that don’t want to do certain things
[8:37:36] hmmidk17: Most people were asking how they could more for the crew
[8:37:37] KingDekar: true
[8:37:39] eazypzz: seems like hes planning before his 2 week vacation
[8:37:39] rob6002: Yea
[8:37:40] c000ls: YEP
[8:37:41] Xernique: yeah lang shooting himself in the foot
[8:37:42] KrisCat: Only one not struggling is lang tbh lol
[8:37:42] its_russo15: everyone was shitting on tony for suggesting this
[8:37:42] difficultsleep3r: Yes. I love it
[8:37:44] TheGleeb: exactly
[8:37:45] IvyOlive: who were the top earners for the crew
[8:37:48] austinw812: the reason he told you is probably because he was on green beer and didn't think about it LUL
[8:37:49] cactustime_: esp since arush carried the group early financially
[8:37:51] Hendrics: LUL feelings get hurt
[8:37:56] Xernique: think y'all need to decide on a saving goal. like a crew house. and have everyone want to contribute instead of it feeling like a chore
[8:37:57] 11_jakjak_11: Yeah Luciano as well lol
[8:37:57] garythesistafista: I just imagined lang saying "broke bitch"
[8:37:58] iamwillbur: @austinw812 true alol
[8:37:59] lunate87: arush carried the weed as well
[8:38:00] djerbis: i d give arush a pass cuz he did put 100% of his time to the crew
[8:38:01] tannerrobbz: Lang is just too ignorant to his people lol
[8:38:03] redemer12: so when you chop but don’t want to run sewage or do the money runs
[8:38:04] avb5545: So he is doing the entire thing. Stealing the AC>get jewelry>pawn it>wash it>money order
[8:38:04] lunate87: thats why he is broke
[8:38:06] FacetiousChrist: @cactustime_ good point
[8:38:09] spudd710: i mean i guess that can be viewed as personal activity up to the dons at the end of the day
[8:38:09] mCerti: Lang needs more awareness for those sort of things LUL
[8:38:13] Pancakehumper: does Arush still do Snr Buns?
[8:38:16] Nywro: Tally sheet is where it counts, as long as it is actually implemented - and the person cares about that side of things.
[8:38:18] leswes17: Lang isn’t doing too bad lol
[8:38:19] fraudiola9: @kriscat  well hes the only one  still work his legal job
[8:38:20] xiell: gigi is offline, shes recording something ooc
[8:38:25] iamwillbur: @Pancakehumper i dont tyhink so
[8:38:25] Aumilly: Gigi still crunching numbers??
[8:38:29] Big_Reeeeeee: I think she had something on no?
[8:38:37] iamwillbur: @Aumilly the crunching queen
[8:38:39] Tokaye: she had things she had to get done
[8:38:39] 11_jakjak_11: Lmao did Harry not go to the meeting?
[8:38:46] KrisCat: @fraudiola9 most of his money comes from buy and flipping materials tho, not running sani itself.
[8:39:04] lyfmobile: this is so cool tho
[8:39:06] fraudiola9: @kriscat  yeah but legal jobs jobs still gets you good money lol
[8:39:13] Pancakehumper: 70
[8:39:13] emiz0r: 70 Pog
[8:39:14] eazypzz: this is pretty dope ngl
[8:39:17] Iron_PTMN: 70 Pog
[8:39:23] GreasySlothKing: OOOO
[8:39:25] KrisCat: @fraudiola9 and ppl like speedy and luciano didn't have time to run legal jobs because they had to push a lot of weed for a while
[8:39:28] iamwillbur: this is pretty good money no??
[8:39:30] lunate87: oh 70 because rep went up?
[8:39:30] Aumilly: as long as she inputs the right formulas in a spreadsheet it will just be a plug and play. I’m assuming that’s what she is working on
[8:39:33] bygoneflygon: moonshines worth more than weed KEKW
[8:39:37] peepomi: yuno has 244k from doing legal jobs only pretty much
[8:39:42] eazypzz: sandy shores druggies
[8:39:47] c000ls: YEP 󠀀
[8:39:48] EyeScraem: hopefully
[8:39:50] C1st10b: FUCK LEGAL JOBS
[8:39:51] Foamed: I like that this job is pretty low-key.
[8:39:52] Evo_Me: yea fuck legal jobs
[8:39:54] lunate87: the legal front though
[8:39:54] quote_me_if_horsen: yep it will end bad
[8:39:54] EyeScraem: ppl are Deadge from grinding
[8:39:59] Xernique: yeah eventually crim work will be where its at
[8:39:59] antsinmaheyesjohnson: mat prices going up until then tho
[8:40:02] iamwillbur: oh yeah as things are still getting rolled out theres endless oppritunities
[8:40:03] wes2UNcanny: lol aint you broke?
[8:40:09] bruHoran: Aware
[8:40:10] EyeScraem: mat prices do be crazy right now tho
[8:40:12] AdLib_24: seems really lowkey
[8:40:14] CheffBoiRZ: earthwell is forever
[8:40:16] eazypzz: take over sandy shores and this shit will pop off
[8:40:18] franciscooo25: sani is great money now
[8:40:19] LuciferSpirt: 4.0 has a unique situation in which there are tons of options
[8:40:19] c000ls: illegal monies is tax free... lol
[8:40:20] EvilRobotNinja: A person could just hustle the kinds of runs all day
[8:40:21] difficultsleep3r: Mats at $7 is still too good to turn down
[8:40:22] peepomi: true
[8:40:24] plutr0nium: That's true
[8:40:26] ihawk5929: Did you read the % on the label????
[8:40:29] GlennTheWolf: 8$ per is pretty crazy though
[8:40:30] 11_jakjak_11: But the first part of the crew is keeping a clean job right?
[8:40:32] il_capitano91: how much materials do you get in  1hr?
[8:40:32] realitijd24: true
[8:40:39] chalkiewhite: gangstarr is undefeated
[8:40:39] rem87062597: As long as Buddha runs the mat market you can focus on things you want to move towards long term
[8:40:40] Iron_PTMN: $8 Mats is too good to pass up atm
[8:40:47] mel0yelo: i wonder how rich teddy is
[8:40:54] zazmania: do you know how much Lang has in his bank account in charachter
[8:40:55] ryuudrg: you are pretty much paying to do crim things
[8:41:05] CheffBoiRZ: teddy and cloak both have to be sooo rich
[8:41:06] iamwillbur: its so sick that you actually place the bottle down and they place the cash down haha
[8:41:15] EyeScraem: teddy and cloak going to be farming this wekk
[8:41:17] EyeScraem: week*
[8:41:22] MadAceHatter: is like dnd either you max at 1 class or do multi class but didnt ripe all the max benefit
[8:41:33] eazypzz: i just hope people dont burn out
[8:41:40] chechi_12: !song
[8:41:40] Nightbot: The Current Song is X Gon' Give It To Ya by DMX
[8:41:58] alaskan485: dont forget its all rep based
[8:41:58] FickleTickler: DMX got a weird voice mangoSmug
[8:42:04] quote_me_if_horsen: they are prob all conected
[8:42:05] EnviousNarwhal: connecting webs maybe
[8:42:09] EyeScraem: yea I don't think rep for most of the jobs matter
[8:42:10] goodvibezon: !song
[8:42:15] tarzandaking: He is like a middle man
[8:42:18] KrisCat: @eazypzz burnout is inevitable at some point. it's always been the case.
[8:42:22] GreasySlothKing: might just be a stepping stone
[8:42:27] redemer12: but some of that stuff might just be time locked right now
[8:42:38] iiidannyii: Maybe later you will get something
[8:42:38] eazypzz: DOORDASH
[8:42:40] rem87062597: Civ jobs are going to balance, crim jobs are going to open up. Easy choice IMO as long as civ jobs are covered by others.
[8:42:55] EyeScraem: maybe in the future they'll add more for higher rep
[8:42:55] MadAceHatter: shady moonshine deal
[8:43:01] normalbnt: Perfect car for it really
[8:43:13] Evo_Me: u like this car now?
[8:43:14] PteradactylJones: i really like that there are other crime jobs besides. like robber or drug maker
[8:43:17] KindaTru: Not all is ready in development and some things are ready but will hurt the economy, at least is what buddha said
[8:43:33] ryuudrg: the reps were pretty much just to get the default sani from 3.0 KEKW
[8:43:34] lopeadrian02: this stream us chill af
[8:43:35] EyeScraem: @PteradactylJones oh this 100% hopefully tho ppl in the middle get benefits for rep tho
[8:43:35] eazypzz: doordash, just leave it at the door
[8:43:36] Foamed: @GreasySlothKing for sure, the devs will improve on the system, create new jobs within jobs, and give it akll more depth over time.
[8:43:45] exo__23: the overheating tho Sadge
[8:43:47] Tamzim: no more over heating?
[8:43:49] iiidannyii: And it's quick
[8:43:56] iamwillbur: overheating aint to bad tbh
[8:43:57] MadAceHatter: somehow reminds me of early lang weed 3.0
[8:43:58] EyeScraem: @Tamzim its much slower to overheat
[8:43:59] plutr0nium: It's really good for checking out spots to rat
[8:43:59] arttention: so much better now that it doesn't overheat as much
[8:44:02] SpilledNuts: the overheating is so much better now
[8:44:04] Demeir: It doesn't seem like its overheating as fast anymore, thats nice.
[8:44:09] exo__23: really now thats nice
[8:44:16] JasmineWynn: maybe Mosley's will get a cooler that'll help with overheating
[8:44:17] stickeweenie: Are there  different battery options
[8:44:18] Iron_PTMN: EVs Pog
[8:44:19] SergeGray: It's got really good upsides, with acceleratuin and offroad capabilities
[8:44:20] oldwrldblues: they need a long distance battery mod
[8:44:21] DrakeNightbane: I feel like this with a 99mm turbo is just gonna be a juicer car. Cause it'll hit those top speeds near instantly.
[8:44:29] Foamed: catJAM
[8:44:33] mCerti: There was a time that Lang was not even paying Harry for his mats LUL just saying all that money will go to the crew anyway
[8:44:34] Evo_Me: this car in black would look sexy
[8:44:35] eli_churches: jammies
[8:44:37] arttention: harrSTEER
[8:44:38] EyeScraem: @DrakeNightbane cant put turbos in EV
[8:44:41] n8richards: good off-road,  good storage
[8:44:43] ishouldprobably: you're so far removed from sani 0 that you don't remember how bad it is. no recyclables, no recycler, can't specify individual mats from vendor. that's very valuable
[8:44:49] SpilledNuts: maybe don't sell it until you can get a van
[8:44:50] lyfmobile: yup
[8:44:50] DrakeNightbane: @DrakeNightbane Ah lame, still an insane car.
[8:44:51] EyeScraem: @DrakeNightbane its why the acceleration is so fast
[8:44:56] normalbnt: Sell the futo to Clem, she needs anything. Getting a van is going to take forever
[8:44:58] eazypzz: its reliable in terms of driving too
[8:45:01] MADxBACKWARDS: call Pidgeon back and be like 20k!
[8:45:01] Iron_PTMN: KKona
[8:45:02] Astereous: Sell it and get a speedo
[8:45:04] aaronisleepy: i think u can sell the futo and get a speedo
[8:45:07] EnviousNarwhal: gods moonshine
[8:45:08] exo__23: so does it get u from city to paleto with how much overheat
[8:45:08] n8richards: campinguyYee bruther
[8:45:11] Aynumi: Tony wants the futo
[8:45:16] saliromeo: @mcerti well, it did
[8:45:19] Evo_Me: one of those vans lang has is amazing
[8:45:21] Nywro: 66, fitting
[8:45:24] EyeScraem: might be worth to take a loss on the futo just to get rid of it
[8:45:29] Aynumi: harrSTEER harrSTEER
[8:45:29] SpilledNuts: so about $500 for one box
[8:45:30] yahmobethere: @Iron_PTMN you think that is kkona?
[8:45:30] CheffBoiRZ: $500 a run not too bad
[8:45:33] Foamed: Maybe Stag is home. Sadge
[8:45:39] BlacKnight2514: whats the pay like
[8:45:48] oldwrldblues: 59-70~ a bottle for this recipe
[8:45:59] Iron_PTMN: @Iron_PTMN HUH ?
[8:46:10] KindaTru: 58 to 70
[8:46:17] lyfmobile: need to crack down whole formula
[8:46:23] chalkiewhite: wait did x and Marty rob the company again? lol

[10:41:57] hasanviewer0801: @tetrafork dougie didn’t even get a chance when he was mad at lang he made dougie go against him instead of voicing concerns

[10:42:06] notpsychz: the best thing about gaslighting in RP is when meta chatter snitch they also sound like they are gaslighting so then streamer doesnt know who to believe and you can have an actual genuine reaction

[10:42:24] Jayroks: OMEGALUL
[10:42:26] TastyKudzu: The issue pretty clearly is that people who want to earn all their money through dirty means are always giving up 30% but people who are working clean jobs keep 100% and that feels unfair to those wanting to do exclusively dirty work.
[10:42:27] ZireaelXV: widepeepoJuiceSpin

[10:42:29] pillowlavaa: Classic

[10:42:33] AnomanderRake__: JUICE ME SOME ADS HARRY
[10:42:34] Ydomat: if you have a legit side hustle that is fine, if you have an illegal side hustle and don’t contribute any of it to the crew that’s no bueno.

[10:42:40] yubihunter: So can you only have a side hustle if it is a clean job like Lang?
[10:42:40] snshot04: so he juiced it YEP
[10:42:40] Nywro: Lang would drop 90% of that if he saw the sanitation building he wanted for sale in a second.

[10:42:46] dotsux_: does sani money go towards crew?
[10:42:48] eazypzz: flash told you this right????
[10:42:52] Oni_mara: we just need to have someone kidnap cloak again and all will be resolved
[10:42:52] Lazzy_419: so he has to slave at snr buns to keep his own money?
[10:42:52] myboiblu: can’t wait for the outcome of all this
[10:42:53] mysticmonkey321: @Aumilly
[10:42:54] g0m3rrrr: it is physcially impossible for Lang to hanve that much personal by the way. his personal is a bit wishy washy
[10:42:54] DampsHt: but tbf lang used his own mats in the pc's without cost
[10:42:56] Tiilde: KEKW

[10:43:04] DarthRadonis: How was your Moonshine thing you were doing earlier Harry?
[10:43:04] bruHoran: @tastykudzu then don’t be in the group
[10:43:05] KrisCat: @TastyKudzu well, they are required to kick up clean money each week. but that prob should increase at some point.
[10:43:06] SpilledNuts: The don's are also expected to focus more on crew
[10:43:08] Aynumi: What did he put in the VU?
[10:43:08] BlueShift_IV: Do you think gaslighting Marty will explode due to history with the company?
[10:43:09] hmmidk17: @its_ajc Isn't the first rule of the crew to hold a legal job?
[10:43:09] Xernique: @Joneszlive no, because they only agreed to bring dirty cash to the crew. they havent said anything about legal jobs
[10:43:12] KindaTru: So the only way to make personal money is clean hustle or clean work besides kickups
[10:43:12] yellownectarines: Isnt he using the crowbar from the crew tho?
[10:43:12] AnomanderRake__: peepoJuiceFast
[10:43:14] greatzky999: but lang will defend himself telling he ´s flipping and putting sweat n tears into it 14h a days when aroush did not

[10:43:34] NoblesseXXX: Octo, Yuno, Maty are Rich AF
[10:43:36] its_ajc: @hmmidk17 Yeah, but guaranteed none of them remember that lol
[10:43:41] The_Orange_Flash: Lang constantly pushing buttons on purpose. which is great for spice
[10:43:41] upsetgato: @hasanviewer0801 why do people keep saying that, when did he do that
[10:43:42] asileaux: VU time? lol
[10:43:52] Amine_MLC: this stream today is rp gigabuffed

[10:43:54] mysticpo0l: @xernique other than yuno tbh
[10:43:55] Lazzy_419: @kaozvi it is for the amount they get paid there
[10:43:56] zxJroc: classic juiced it
[10:44:02] ishkababbles: If you are only making dirty money then all that goes to crew, correct?
[10:44:02] juicexgx: @g0m3rrrr not really he buys everyone’s mats and upsells them. Harry could do that to but he likes doing the ratting and other info. he sees lang on the phone all day and he doesn’t want to do it
[10:44:06] lolmaiyaa: @joneszlive g6 for yuno is all clean money from a normal job, in this case it’s dirty money
[10:44:06] awolfinsheepsclothing420: @upsetgato he did he ain't wrong.
[10:44:07] joeymack57: arush cant make legal money. senor buns is not it anymore. he going 100% illegal

[10:44:17] KaozVI: @lazzy_419 then he should work somewhere else.
[10:44:17] Xernique: but I think a system where civ job grinders are encouraged to donate a part of their income is good
[10:44:20] sleepyeles: so a dirty money versus legal money issue
[10:44:21] CandleLit7: Yeah exactly
[10:44:21] upsetgato: @upsetgato no im not fighting it or arguing i just dont know what harry did
[10:44:23] redemer12: let’s gooooo
[10:44:24] g0m3rrrr: Lang is clever - he does not contribute 30% of the flipped materials to the crew
[10:44:26] DarthRadonis: Yea
[10:44:26] Miffmac: has the house bills been paid?
[10:44:27] simular: i feel that with arush
[10:44:31] Deathchampt: speed probably has invested to most but still
[10:44:33] joe_johnny: I'm banking on heads ez

[10:44:33] bruHoran: that simple
[10:44:34] AhgaBoo: It could be for the people who work9 +un.

[10:44:39] joeymack57: arush doesnt want to do legal work anymroe

[10:44:46] Tiilde: @joeymack57 yeah but he doesnt have a felony, he can work Grime and G6 and other legal jobs as well
[10:44:46] hasanviewer0801: @upsetgato it’s been a while that’s why dougie isn’t really with the crew. lang liked dougie and he was supposed to be one of the first in the crew but Harry did some fucked shit and made dougie out to be a bad guy
[10:44:47] uknwwhtshedidurhauntingd: JUICEIT

[10:45:00] FacetiousChrist: exactly that’s the problem arush ain’t doing legal job
[10:45:00] yubihunter: Does Brown feel that is fair? Seem like this system only benefits Lang. @Harry
[10:45:00] asileaux: aka Yuno
[10:45:02] lilqueso_: lang can do it but can't explain it to marty, oscar and larry lolo they pretty much only make legal money
[10:45:02] Moby1kanobee: look at cloak she proly has 300K
[10:45:04] pit0907: that’s how “mafias” work
[10:45:06] OneLegitTrue: lang is blind, arush gave money to get mats by buying, but now it's not cuz no one is selling. So Lang is making money from sani even if he makes 50cents. He hasn't bought for weeks
[10:45:09] Daemon_Hood: Everyone could do just like Octo and call it a night
[10:45:10] KingDekar: harry could have soo many cars
[10:45:11] kSwong9: Also people keep calling it kick backs but it's really just getting paid for the work they did
[10:45:13] greatzky999: but 10k legit and the dirty money income is not equal i guess
[10:45:14] Face_32: the weekly buy in is the tax on legal money
[10:45:17] mhmLuca: did brown get his kickback?
[10:45:20] its_ajc: @yubihunter huh the system is literally money for everyone lol
[10:45:22] joeymack57: he doesnt mess with the weed just the roof thing

[10:45:23] DarthRadonis: Exactly its fun watching you do all the other stuff
[10:45:23] zazmania: think how much money Teddy has
[10:45:26] Hendrics: Lang doesnt know about Harry doing moonshine?
[10:45:29] PkTwo187: you need to have fun, at the end of the day its a game

[10:45:54] DampsHt: yeah marty was told with luc
[10:45:55] Deathchampt: so can octo and tony earn side cash?
[10:45:56] Face_32: putting money into the group to help it grow is Langs hope
[10:45:59] Xernique: the kickback system only got estqb
[10:45:59] robertdoso: The problem with Langs of balancing things out is that no one in the crew will become a master at anything
[10:46:00] lolSMCballs: but the house does not onvest into legal operations, stuff like butc and weed is backed mainly by the crew money pool
[10:46:00] joeymack57: people doing 100% illegal work is getting penalized badly
[10:46:01] ModernMilk: Lang isnt wrong about Octo. He's got his shit together.

[10:46:11] iiidaaah: @rem87062597 to bring the crew forward, the crew mentality, why be in the crew if the person doesnt want it to go forward

[10:46:22] Panoramic_Views: yeah and although it should motivate others to hear everyones elses kickbacks might be better to do it in private
[10:46:23] snipesindasix: But how do you contribute if you don't do crims jobs for dirty bills??
[10:46:23] AdRoKa_: It’s like a pyramid

[10:46:26] Manupandey77: all people were suppose to hold a clean job but few people were 100% illegal
[10:46:30] Hoxter: I guess problem is people don't see the bigger picture of gathering money for the group
[10:46:30] Nywro: Crime doesn't pay, much.
