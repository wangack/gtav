[0:40:52] notdustinx: @AlexSnipess123 cornwood got fired
[0:40:52] amanmama: @alexsnipess123 fired
[0:41:15] fran_3494: its either 'in IRL...' or 'it's RP' cant be both
[0:41:17] Riqui__: @notdustinx suspended *
[0:41:21] Bulletbill13: @Minipx11 i dont know if i have ever watched his stream live. I am saying as an RP streamer he could not goto PD and he would be fine. I am not saying the streamer personally does not like PD. Sorry if i confused you
[0:41:21] TheLadyCupcake: den got fired, cornwood got suspended
[0:41:22] amanmama: Chat did he react to Cornwood?
[0:41:23] randyrandoe: For clarity and accountability cops should wear cams and mics for review
[0:41:27] miketwng: @notdustinx that's Denzel that got fired
[0:41:32] liljma_: man like dean whats good

[0:42:18] TheLadyCupcake: esfandCOPS i hate esfand but love cornwood esfandOkay
[0:42:20] Janman88: not appreciate the streamer instead of the char
[0:42:20] LeonardoDiCaprisun_: @athasin looool
[0:42:21] randyrandoe: Yah they think that the character and streamer feel the same about situations
[0:42:23] thatdonkeyy: Yea people are crazy with that. Can't separate character from streamer
[0:42:27] bosschar95: you can hate ruth and slacks but not SAab and cheever7
[0:42:27] 101toad: YEP
[0:42:28] FvmousAce_: it’s just rp
[0:42:29] Enoobrac: @GalaxyDoesTwich no he condemns but he doesnt condone
[0:42:31] Jethrq: @Lewz3k LUL
[0:42:32] eXceLenT_: even if you disagree with the decisions the streamer makes for the character, don't be an asshole NODDERS
[0:42:36] Athasin: @Athasin It was literally like if a butterfly flaps its wing on one side of the world it causes a tsunami on the other
[0:42:38] BDG_Toa676: Charles the dog is a asshole
[0:42:41] 101toad: Like tbh, we all hate Ruth
[0:42:42] yunginnine: u don’t condone or u condemn
[0:42:43] smokiiiiiii1: but in Rp fuck captain ruth
[0:42:47] Sparty071: I really hate shiesty
[0:42:47] badperson1234: Yeah only problem is some people are shit heads to the streamers with ill reason :/
[0:42:49] ZuldeadTV: and i think most people understand, but a few bad apples are very loud about it when hopping
[0:42:49] sal_ezzy: !server
[0:42:51] Serenati0n: wow sick G2 mask
[0:42:52] amanmama: Chat did dean hear the Cornwood news?

[0:42:58] 101toad: But Chevver is awsome for playing her so good.
[0:42:59] LeonardoDiCaprisun_: Its a game, i cant hate a whole person for how they play a game
[0:43:04] DaCrazyHun: @101toad fact

[0:43:14] BDG_Toa676: deansoPa
[0:43:16] Lewz3k: #fuckruth
[0:43:16] Bulletbill13: That is how I thought about Cpt Ruth, that it was just the character. But OOC her opinion is robot cops. she just clarified that over the last few days.
[0:43:18] macneutron: Saab is a G. Can't imagine anyone else listening to complaints for 5+ hrs every time he is on and taking the heat from chatters
[0:43:26] DaCrazyHun: But hopefully both cornwood and Den turn it around and make something of this
[0:43:28] randyrandoe: @undy97 Saab chat goes to emote only in a flash
[0:43:30] WolfOfWotan: LUL
[0:43:34] theblackdog808: Lol
[0:43:44] undy97: I bet @randyrandoe
[0:43:50] bosschar95: saab chat is wild lol

[0:43:58] georgiaassasin: Good morning Dean and chat
[0:43:58] LeonardoDiCaprisun_: Like just cuz i dont like how someone plays a game.. cant hate the whole person... dont make sense
[0:44:02] luis_king82: but without cornwood I wouldn't have found you... that suck!! ...
[0:44:04] Janman88: @macneutron yeah i feel bad for both of them for trying to make a good difference to then get so much flack

[0:44:21] TheFiku: ReallyMad  WTF
[0:44:22] Silvertap: RP or IRL whatever, what people hate to see (IMO) is seen the good guys loosing for ever, almost never getting a W
[0:44:31] miketwng: @amanmama brotha knows
[0:44:37] biffster42: ChrisTombstones chat went emote only too for awhile. it was wild just a few hours ago.
[0:44:40] Bulletbill13: viewers want content first and RP 2nd... thats why saab gets their current lvl of hate
[0:44:41] caligirlbeaches: Morning D
[0:44:43] BDG_Toa676: Damn Xypher gotta let mfs know there was a flip dawg

[0:45:29] Athasin: @tukidi_ Nah he's security
[0:45:30] BDG_Toa676: deansoP deansoP
[0:45:32] badperson1234: W or L as long as the streamers getting good attention is the important thing

[0:45:52] lowkeyOP_: FREE DAPZEL
[0:45:53] BDG_Toa676: nods
[0:45:58] Architank: @Bulletbill13 I mean if I wanted to watch real cop and criminal interactions I would watch Live PD or other cop shows.
[0:45:58] ezrem2: @amanmama What was the cornwood news?
[0:45:58] Lewz3k: maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan
[0:45:59] Athasin: @onlyicxrus People who actually like to RP

[0:46:28] froogo0: DAPzel no more! Technically, he's down to 0 DAPs LUL
[0:46:31] Bulletbill13: @onlyicxrus exactly, thats why people are annoyed at saab and dislike Ruth. They are not great content right now regardless of if it is good RP or not.
[0:46:31] Athasin: He knows your heart lies with Denzel
[0:46:33] Jethrq: deansoZ
[0:46:43] onlyicxrus: @Athasin Rp comes from content, if you keep repeating same shit 24/7 it gets boring and that's what rp is if there's no content
[0:46:46] liljma_: what are you plans with dean quincy
[0:46:47] Athasin: @froogo0 It's Donezel now
[0:46:55] Alipopscar: @bdg_toa676 woa
[0:46:56] Janman88: also mad props how u handle the denzel situation brother @Deansocool other streamer would not tank it like u

[0:47:30] chmbrs: solid content
[0:47:30] Athasin: @onlyicxrus Nah. There is a reason why so many streamers are not RPing with their "eyes off" because RP in itself is enjoyable.
[0:47:31] Belial2k: cornwood xdd

[0:48:17] reactseu: LUL
[0:48:17] onlyicxrus: @Athasin of course. that's not the point. Lively hood of streamers and content creators is based on "content". If it's a drywell nothing comes out of it

[0:48:57] Clivent: LUL
[0:48:58] Athasin: @onlyicxrus It is the point since you're saying content only is how RP should be.
[0:49:00] Clivent: :)
[0:49:01] Janman88: cant wait for NMP to finally pull the trigger on cop LUL
[0:49:02] rhaziaa: Hopefully LASO/BCSO gets set up by March, then just become insta officer there w/ the blessing of Sheriff Cornwood
[0:49:04] FvmousAce_: Barry MeCockner?
[0:49:04] eddiesky21: just saying, you could not have handled everything after the suspension better, and still got fired. that just rly sucks man
[0:49:07] Haider_Mcfc: g1ngeBoogie￼ g1ngeBoogie

[0:49:41] Athasin: @thomas123456789012345677 Fired
[0:49:41] Janman88: afaik too much OTK planning and stuff going on
[0:49:42] bigak97: Dean Quicy >> Den Zel Shiesty
[0:49:42] fideito__: fideito__ subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! 
[0:49:43] draxler077: Nick with his goldfish memory om
[0:49:47] BDG_Toa676: 12 Ws deansoShake
[0:49:47] onlyicxrus: @Athasin that's not what I said at all. I said content should be above rp, but they both support each other. If you cut off the content the rp cant fluorish and if there is no rp there is no content. its symbiosis
[0:49:48] m4l1kkk: Dean will look like a grown ass man in kindergarten 😂😂😂
[0:49:49] BDG_Toa676: deansoP deansoP
[0:49:56] miketwng: @thomas123456789012345677 probably quit playing
[0:49:58] eddiesky21: @chmbrs he talks about it sometimes but it will never happen i think
[0:49:58] captain_steve_420: We gonna see Denzel and Cornwood off duty together? @Deansocool
[0:50:02] toasturuu: I think their gonna hoe u at the Academy gonna make an example
[0:50:03] himalayanre: nopixel PD in shambles, just saw the cornwood clip
[0:50:08] Shredwerdd: cornwood was pissed af last night. straight up calling for Ruth to be fired. never saw him that heated
[0:50:20] m4l1kkk: Dean will look like a grandad amongst children in Academy
[0:50:24] bigpharmaa: you taking this too well but tbh im glad you not stressin over rp like that
[0:50:26] SoggyM0uth: Took good for academy
[0:50:30] BDG_Toa676: @onlyicxrus symbiosis una I like that
[0:50:30] ezrem2: cornwood clip was real
[0:50:46] MakiWind: Ruth probally said make excempel of i just but i dont fired and give you a new chance why dont suspend you until ure dap is gone.
[0:50:55] LeonardoDiCaprisun_: He only streamed, cuz he was playing games watching streams in his sparw time, like shiiiit, I could do the same.
[0:50:58] m4l1kkk: Civ Gang would get yoinked 😭
[0:50:58] draxler077: Clueless
[0:51:04] toasturuu: Civ Gang loaded omE
[0:51:05] Bulletbill13: lol he said they are gonna give out civ weapon licences
[0:51:09] Athasin: @onlyicxrus And I disagree, RP came before the content, and RP will survive without it just like it did before.
[0:51:13] miketwng: Slacks and Ruth prolly slept together
[0:51:14] Acheron13: Civ gang has a shit ton of money
[0:51:22] amanmama: Denzel can do academy with Cornwood
[0:51:23] Shredwerdd: Esfand was right tho. this shit affects peoples actual streams and livelihood. over a fucking game
[0:51:37] LeonardoDiCaprisun_: @miketwng woag, that came out of left field 😂😂😂
[0:51:53] onlyicxrus: @Athasin we can agree to disagree with that, but it wouldn't stay so big if there is no content
[0:51:58] amanmama: @shredwerdd did you see ruth's take?
[0:51:59] miketwng: @leonardodicaprisun_ oops
[0:52:06] Puncake: @miketwng you just wake up n decided to smoker crack my man?? AINTNOWAY
[0:52:07] osamaspinladen_1: nah denzel got fired nahhh
[0:52:20] Shredwerdd: @amanmama nah got a link?

[0:52:37] Lord__Gen: @amanmama what did she say
[0:52:39] PeterPanTheKing: 2 per tsunami every 2 weeks or sm like that
[0:52:45] miketwng: @puncake uh that thought crossed my mind when i watched the clips
[0:52:54] Puncake: damn
[0:52:59] amanmama: @shredwerdd watch puse on YouTube
[0:53:02] omar_imp: yea spread it out fairly
[0:53:07] Athasin: Ahhh so 6 crates and 2 per tsunami
[0:53:10] Adamsm003: Adamsm003 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! 
[0:53:14] Athasin: That seems fair
[0:53:16] LeonardoDiCaprisun_: @athasin nah content over rp, without throwing away the rp... nopixel is successful because of the content... theres otber servers that have better rp, but they arent as successful
[0:53:17] BreadPitt___: I think 3 a week
[0:53:20] badperson1234: They should lock them out so they can't just rip them 30 mins before tsunami
[0:53:26] Athasin: CG won't be able to do it LUL
[0:53:38] Charmeer: they did it
[0:53:38] pilhass10: @Athasin he doesn't know PepeLaugh

[0:59:10] m4l1kkk: Slacks chooses 😭
[0:59:11] FvmousAce_: run for under sheriff
[0:59:12] Murrig: probably not on NP
[0:59:12] badperson1234: Ruth for sheriff esfandHappy
[0:59:12] Athasin: IRL it's city vote
[0:59:13] cwasrightt: when pred was first picked it was pd vote

[0:59:16] undy97: that what nakoda said PD decide
[0:59:19] jonski1220: think pd vote
[0:59:22] thumeknight: new legislation i thought
[0:59:23] undy97: according to crane
[0:59:24] macneutron: They could f*ck him over with the requirements to run
[0:59:25] Murrig: they know if it's city, cornwood will get it
[0:59:26] pathasahat: rUTH WANTS ONLY cAPTAINS TO BE ELIGIBLE
[0:59:26] knowlightnofear: Cornwood immediately suspended because of Dean's one life character. Nuts
[0:59:30] Architank: In real life you vote for sheriff I don't know about RP
[0:59:30] tinstarfish99: They're working on changing the legislation tho
[0:59:30] pathasahat: sry caps
[0:59:33] GlitchyByte: i had to go to sleep last night didn't catch the meeting after tsunami. i miss slack cornwood meeting
[0:59:34] luis_king82: ithey want Ruth ...
[0:59:35] Athasin: Yeah if it's PD vote...
[0:59:39] walkgleesh: depends
[0:59:40] mmmurple: You don't think cornwood gets it with pd vote? seems like he would be the favourite
[0:59:43] omascas: nope lol
[0:59:44] toasturuu: IRL sometimes it's a public vote or elected officials vote
[0:59:45] onlyicxrus: there's confusion about it since counsil thinks they can do it but the captains dont want that
[0:59:46] MexiBrent: Depends on who gets to run for it, they come up with some kinda DAP rule
[0:59:48] Bulletbill13: idk if pd would vote since many would leave lspd for bcso
[0:59:49] ramsin50: but doesn’t the sheriff has to be an officer first
[0:59:51] Athasin: If you were fired he's getting fired
[0:59:54] illuminat4242: Ruth is head hunting him
[0:59:56] FvmousAce_: When does corn meet with panel?
[0:59:56] Silvertap: Lawyer Arc
[0:59:56] Gmoneyusmc: that's fucked up if he keeps his job but you didn't though @Deansocool
[0:59:57] n8dogg03: Cornwood's a lawyer too.  he has options
[0:59:57] SarahFlare: the mayor sent slacks and cornwood a new document in development so that the mayors office has more control over PD
[0:59:58] himalayanre: corrupt PD
[0:59:59] VincentsDeath: however it could change, moon is making a lot of new moves never before seen in 3.0
[1:00:03] theblackdog808: I think they'll fire him too going by the rp direction LUL
[1:00:03] Reuschel: he won’t if Ruth has any say. she wanted him charged with murder.
[1:00:04] condor2104: If new legislation passes it will be upto the myaor's office
[1:00:04] Murrig: @mmmurple i think probably with pd vote, but even more likely if city vote
[1:00:05] soulshade: mayor is pushing for sheriff office with cornwood
[1:00:13] Jethrq: "if Ruth becomes Sherrif, rain shall fall upon the pd"
[1:00:15] LeonardoDiCaprisun_: Even with a pd vote i still think cornwood wins... unless they veto behind the scenes
[1:00:17] cwasrightt: I think if you have daps in last 30 days you are ineligible to be sheriff
[1:00:18] tinstarfish99: If it stays within the PD the captains might not choose someone who has been suspended or has daps
[1:00:19] macneutron: Chief of Police might happen sooner than sheriff
[1:00:22] ramsin50: what panel they just give a decision
[1:00:24] illuminat4242: And no the Mayor wants to change how sheriff is Elected
[1:00:25] j0Ity: im interested to see what sorts of shenanigans off duty cops get up to tbh
[1:00:32] GlitchyByte: according to (earlier in the day) slacks that people with daps would not be eligible to being elected
[1:00:40] luis_king82: They are going to give him his job back but they are not going to let Cornwood participate in the election... the excuse, he was suspended @Deansocool
[1:00:44] Athasin: @tinstarfish99 If it's PD then it won't just be up to the Captains
[1:00:50] MexiBrent: i mean you accidentally hurt some one, he purposely shot someone extra, kinda not looking great
[1:00:51] onlyicxrus: @cwasrightt its not a rule yet but slacks wants it to be
[1:00:54] ultimategamersan: there is some secret document I won't detail it but ruth is on to something
[1:01:05] gmuny__: Hope you are well Deano deansoHeart deansoHeart
[1:01:12] VoxQuantum: whos got daps
[1:01:12] kylemacs: seems like you Denzel and Cornwood  got punished for having fun every once in a while. (because it’s a game at the end of the day)
[1:01:15] chmbrs: i think cornwoods hard work for the pd out weighs his mistakes so i think hes gonna be fine
[1:01:21] VoxQuantum: cause they are gonna fuck over anyone with daps
[1:01:25] Murrig: PD will rig it if they can
[1:01:26] froogo0: Aziz is on the list to gettin DAP'd out

[1:01:46] jonski1220: aziz also has DAPs
[1:01:46] ramsin50: the will say aaiz can’t because he has daps
[1:01:47] bigak97: @chmbrs not how they see it but you right
[1:01:48] Juhoze: I mean mayor is now the boss of the PD so i think he will rig it for cornwood
[1:01:50] Jethrq: EVERYONE IS GETTING DAPPED deansoSad
[1:01:56] pr0digy_1: oh he dont know
[1:02:03] Silvertap: Hey Aziz has guts...
[1:02:03] Athasin: @chmbrs Agreed, he probably wouldve gotten Mayor if he hadn't dropped out
[1:02:04] illuminat4242: The mayor wants to change how Sheriff is elected to where people put their name in the hat  and the state chooses who it is
[1:02:04] froogo0: It's like the PD higher ups wants to DAP out Denzel, Cornwood, Forte, then Aziz monkaS
[1:02:07] kb420ps: The only way that the sheriff's office will be fun is if they are completely autonomous from the LSPD.  If the LSPD has control,  it will be the exact same BS.
[1:02:12] MexiBrent: @Juhoze hes going to purpose that, its not a thing yet
[1:02:13] fishiegoblublub: I can’t wait to see slacks get spawn camped for a week, dude is a seminal clown ass

[1:19:30] Athasin: @amanmama Lord Kebun accidentally hits his keys and Cornwood gets suspended
[1:19:31] MrSirDudeGuyBro: i think he got 11
[1:19:34] Architank: 1 DAP for every entry wound LUL

[1:19:37] P51F144: yea I saw the clip he should have gotten 5 for shooting dean that was over kill
[1:19:43] BDG_parth28: Cant lie I been winning all today
[1:19:45] KNGRSM: Esfand is going to RP the shit out of this
[1:19:53] GalaxyDoesTwich: @xypher85 Nah man this is too much im scared now
[1:19:53] BDG_parth28: Whoever is flipping is goat
[1:19:54] xypher85: @BDG_parth28 now you lose
[1:19:59] MDM4ever1986HD: https://clips.twitch.tv/ShakingSwissHyenaUWot-BbtLGlrXSRWOqIW3
[1:20:01] samaelulu: @MrSirDudeGuyBro yeah he has 11 now, because Slacks gave him 1 because he felt insulted PepeLaugh
[1:20:01] MakiWind: 1 was for knight lying saw the stream, 5 points for shooting 1 extra shot for Bass
[1:20:02] BDG_parth28: Stfu
[1:20:08] pallywacker117: Technically, isnt it retaliation to DAP Cornwood for going over CoC is the Mayor is really part of it.
[1:20:10] Blizzard5050: Esfand thinks of the content first, but not everyone agrees, and hence this major clash
[1:20:12] grntcr: Crazy that Johnson getting fired led to all of this. You wouldn't have hit him if he wasn't off duty, then cornwood wouldn't have mag-dumped donald bush if you hadn't been suspended
[1:20:13] KingJayClouted: sooooo
[1:20:16] MrSirDudeGuyBro: @Eduard_LuLu yh
[1:20:16] xypher85: Tails Praygi

[1:20:42] KNGRSM: @Blizzard5050 good content as well, never any malicious intent but still isn't good enough, a word doesn't count anymore
[1:20:43] samaelulu: all the captains are pushing against that tho
[1:20:52] KingJayClouted: I mean tbh u not fired soooooo
[1:21:02] KingJayClouted: u still got ur job sooooo yea
[1:21:04] DonNiko99: oh my lord just saw what happened to cornwood last night
[1:21:04] tukidi_: My internet fuck
[1:21:05] Bulletproof_santa: its not happening
[1:21:05] Architank: North part of the map is for "content" and the city part is for "RP" Kappa
[1:21:09] MakiWind: Other problem is that cops bring problem to each other when not palying on main char
[1:21:09] iMoore_: the knight one was ridiculous to get a dap and without it he wouldn’t be suspended yet… just my opinion obviously
[1:21:10] m4l1kkk: He is fired LUL he has to start again
[1:21:12] RobRoads: I don't think Corn can run now becasue of the Suspention. Slacks was talking about requirements lastnight. I might be wrong
[1:21:16] MrSirDudeGuyBro: he lost his callsign
[1:21:19] j0Ity: getting suspended is one thing, getting fired, no one expected that
[1:21:22] Ebonhawke7: need turner back
[1:21:25] FvmousAce_: coinflip rigged? deansoZ LUL
[1:21:26] crystalinewolf: did the mayor make a paper whatever last night after cornwood as suspended?
[1:21:28] KingJayClouted: no Johnson is fired
[1:21:29] Athasin: Someone might snipe triple one
[1:21:29] getanime: @KingJayClouted he is fired
[1:21:30] Dominikun: You and Cornwood should start a Private Military Company in the north
[1:21:30] chmbrs: and the call sign Sadge
[1:21:30] fishmeatx: seems so biased bro
[1:21:32] SoggyM0uth: No more 111 Sadge
[1:21:33] twitchprimeis4free: revenge arc where den zel gets to captain and takes ruth's spot? omE
[1:21:36] froogo0: Doesn't all that depend on what the Mayor chooses to do?
[1:21:36] KingJayClouted: dean gotta job still
[1:21:41] xypher85: BRO FLIP
[1:21:42] numbuh34: moon2Y
[1:21:43] Redtwintails: Prayge believe in the mayor and co
[1:21:43] khlaah: I think Den Zel is the last one to get fired, I think from here on out, unless a cop does something way out of line, no more are getting fired
[1:21:46] jgans2: https://clips.twitch.tv/ThankfulDoubtfulLyrebirdPMSTwin-l5O2e77fKoH9Hej1 wow
[1:21:47] amanmama: Johnson Fired all of you back lol

[1:21:51] SoggyM0uth: Who u think is gonna take 111 now ?
[1:21:52] cwasrightt: denzel is fired johnson is in the shadow realms
[1:21:54] KNGRSM: Feels like Slacks has a problem with sheriffs office because he knows it would split the already divided PD even more
[1:21:54] Skycoh: i WANT to see the Sheriff's office open up, LSPD and BSCO existing simultaneously with different culture and leadership...and a governing almost Chief of Police like factor. that would create content for sure.
[1:21:55] chmbrs: @xypher85 not after you lil bro'd me cuh
[1:21:57] Dominikun: People have called him and wanted to pay him 500$ to protect them up there
[1:22:00] BDG_parth28: @fvmousace_  its rigged only when moe flipps
[1:22:01] samaelulu: @khlaah Clueless
[1:22:03] crystalinewolf: ooo
[1:22:04] xypher85: @chmbrs DESKCHAN
[1:22:13] jj__walker: Didn't Crane say that the mayor has no power over the PD?
[1:22:14] MrSirDudeGuyBro: @cwasrightt lol
[1:22:16] bdg_hyu: Trash duty or dap is crazy
[1:22:17] xypher85: shall i rig it chat MEGALUL
[1:22:22] GalaxyDoesTwich: @BDG_parth28 TRUE
[1:22:22] Bulletbill13: currently against the law to start a protection company... the counsel made legislation about it already
[1:22:23] belgianswaffel: i just hope esfand does something with cornwood as a civ and not just play something else
[1:22:24] khlaah: @Eduard_LuLu did you see what Aziz and Cornwood did after Den got fired?
[1:22:24] Blizzard5050: @jj__walker for NOW
[1:22:25] KingJayClouted: at least he has a chance to come back could be so much worse ya know ?
[1:22:33] amanmama: @jj__walker he has a big say in legislation
[1:22:35] samaelulu: @khlaah yeah i saw the COB union
[1:22:36] jesscdcc: @KingJayClouted hey man
[1:22:37] ezrem2: aziz and cornwood walked out after den was fired
[1:22:41] chmbrs: @xypher85 count it down cuh
[1:22:47] amal99jacob: @khlaah what did they do?
[1:22:47] iwannanuhh: the way Slacks and Ruth are role played lowkey killed my enjoyment of watching pd RP. they just power trip non stop it’s not fun to watch anything with them in it
[1:22:48] xypher85: 5
[1:22:48] Architank: @Skycoh That would be great but I don't see the current PD leadership letting the Sheriff's office slip out of their control.
[1:22:49] xypher85: 4
[1:22:51] xypher85: 3
[1:22:51] BDG_parth28: Bro @xypher85  for once I'm Winni g plzzz

[1:23:04] XenonVIII: wassup dean!
[1:23:06] chmbrs: !flip
[1:23:06] Fossabot: The coin landed on  Tails
[1:23:06] StreamElements: ‘Tails!’
[1:23:06] JakeStratic: @KNGRSM Slacks just doesn't like his authority being challenged is pretty upset that people don't want to go to him because Cornwood is better to deal with and more understanding.
[1:23:08] m4l1kkk: Cornwood is the only hope left if he gets the office
[1:23:08] seb_thecrab: FUCK
[1:23:09] KingJayClouted: I pray he does
[1:23:09] chmbrs: Pog

[1:23:28] Zarniwooper: Den Zel needs to meet up with Cornwood today
[1:23:28] khlaah: @Eduard_LuLu I don't think anyone who signed that COB can get fired unless it's like real bad ya know?
[1:23:29] crystalinewolf: so much has been built for cornwood. and ppl will challenge the most available captain
[1:23:30] MDM4ever1986HD: https://clips.twitch.tv/InquisitiveBreakableEmuBloodTrail-WuxuWxUtu3xoQVHz
[1:23:33] Gundaree: Cornwood is the only oen deserving it, Mayor will also make it happen and overrule all.

[1:24:04] 1UPRo: If the new laws with the Mayor having control of the PD, He will 100% will get it bc of his relationship to Max.
[1:24:04] m4l1kkk: @xypher85 i flipped 44k into 90k before this one, buddy

[1:24:15] chmbrs: not a scammer :D
[1:24:16] jgans2: what time we doing it sorry to ask
[1:24:18] Dominikun: If they fire CW before the election or if he gets a felony while running around off duty, that's it
[1:24:20] amanmama: This is the perfect time to ERP Dean
[1:24:20] samaelulu: @Bulletbill13 he only brought Lenny back because Esfand begged him ooc
[1:24:22] thimer4: @ezrem2 5daps for 1 bullet is crazy
[1:24:23] MrSirDudeGuyBro: @KingJayClouted are you allowed to make another character for pd or its over over?
[1:24:37] samaelulu: @Eduard_LuLu well... beg is a strong word but you get it
[1:24:39] ezrem2: @thimer4 Yeah I was saying cornwood deserves being sheriff, not the daps
[1:24:39] shards14: shards14 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 31 months, currently on a 31 month streak! Hello
[1:24:41] Tsithik: yup the mayor is all in

[1:25:02] KingJayClouted: like I feel like I’m being black balled ngl
[1:25:04] illuminat4242: Did you see what the mayor wants to do? the email he went to cornwood and slacks.  And that Slacks is worried because the mayor wants leadership change
[1:25:05] TitaniumPrime7: time to get Clay arrested o7
[1:25:07] MakiWind: you can be a para legal to cornwood
[1:25:07] Bulletbill13: @Eduard_LuLu makes sense they are a match made in RP heaven
[1:25:11] iwannanuhh: listening to Slacks gaslight Cornwood for 3 hours was so painful
[1:25:17] Dominikun: Imagine someone pulling over Cornwood and just making up a felony.
[1:25:18] 1UPRo: waziz is going to go demon mode today once he figures out everything LUL
[1:25:18] amanmama: Damm Johnson down bad

[1:25:39] belgianswaffel: cornwood and den in the court against PD lmao
[1:25:40] badperson1234: Sadly the extra bullet being taken in rl standards is what gave it 5 daps
[1:25:43] Villenthessis: EZ
[1:25:50] Skycoh: extra heel muscle
[1:25:56] macneutron: TheIlluminati TheIlluminati TheIlluminati TheIlluminati

[1:26:10] iwannanuhh: no fun in the pd or else
[1:26:11] Bulletproof_santa: lets be real he just wanted cornwood out because cornwood was the only one that would talk back
[1:26:13] MDM4ever1986HD: https://clips.twitch.tv/AgileBillowingChimpanzeeBabyRage-zuW_URB1gB5F7W2C
[1:26:25] Zinzio: @iwannanuhh 100%. Slacks needs to take his own advice and look inwards. I don't think he is capable of that though.
[1:26:27] Leafyerick: @badperson1234 If they did everything by rl standards 90% of the PD would be fired
[1:26:28] amanmama: Slacks worried about his position now instead of the PD
[1:26:30] Money2Much: big boy sk
[1:26:48] chmbrs: clip queue is still open chat! :D
[1:26:50] fleshhy: Without cornwood and denzel as cops I guess I'll just watch crims again Sadge
[1:26:50] Gundaree: @amanmama he should be with the decissions he is making
[1:27:07] P51F144: Buddha not gona hurt SABB streaming career no matter how dumb he is as a captain
[1:27:09] amanmama: @gundaree yeah the mayor ain't happy with him
[1:27:10] ezrem2: this is an iconic clip  https://clips.twitch.tv/AgileBillowingChimpanzeeBabyRage-zuW_URB1gB5F7W2C
[1:27:12] Architank: @Leafyerick Actually if they did it through the RL standards the PD would investigate itself and find no evidence of wrongdoing LUL
[1:27:19] nogr123: did denzl get fired
[1:27:27] jgans2: clips are open guys
[1:27:30] jgans2: we need some
[1:27:32] NoBluez: @leafyerick that’s where the consistency standard isn’t held. some are dealt with rl standards. some are just excused by “it’s a game”
[1:27:38] amal99jacob: is dean with the besties?

[1:27:42] badperson1234: @leafyerick  they are pushing harder than rl standards on some things I've heard
[1:27:42] illuminat4242: @Zinzio No he cant.  He see's it as and this is my opinion that he and the other captains are all that they need and refused to listen to what cornwood was tryin to tell him. When cornwood was saying they had too much on their plate
[1:27:48] m4l1kkk: 220k is insane

[1:57:17] bubblegumx3: @Deansocool honest question, are you IRL stressed about the firing etc thats going on in RP? or does it all stay in character?
[1:57:35] Maximilliarn: @daboytay 5 Daps for shooting one extra bullet into donald bush 23rd
[1:57:39] MDM4ever1986HD: https://clips.twitch.tv/GenerousSourSandstormPeteZaroll-r0oDJzDrYAkDRaFq
[1:57:42] samaelulu: @daboytay he got 6 daps for the shooting and the Knight report and 1 more for "insulting" Slacks so he got 11 total so indefinite suspension
[1:57:43] Bigeyez: Cornwood likely getting fired imo. If Denzel got fired Cornwood getting the same treatment
[1:57:45] heartsonlysoren: they did make the cop union before: Collective Officer Bargaining C.O.B.
[1:57:53] b00st3d_aud1: Prayge cornwood the bounty hunter “You get the wood and the business”
[1:57:58] SlickWillLay: Ramee will probably do cop later on, but not for too long...his crim character is too big/important
[1:57:58] Landoram: has it impacted your viewership?

[1:59:16] fishmeatx: Tru man

[1:59:18] ClutchMoses: They shouldnt  even be handing out more than 1 DAP at a time anyway.

[1:59:28] Oronyx: ruck futh

[1:59:47] Vildux: there has to be more accountability from the captains
[1:59:50] MDM4ever1986HD: @amanmama I wonder how many there is?
[1:59:51] ajay311: It should be 20 daps
[1:59:58] angel0fdeath2k: at least y’all got corn on the cob now
[2:00:00] Zinzio: DAPS should be given by an oversight board or something. The captains 100% should not be in charge
[2:00:01] UchihaJesus: who in there right mind gave Saab a leading role in the PD again XD cause that worked out so well last time. Imagine giving dabs cause ur feelings got hurt
[2:00:01] XenonVIII: when he said about welfare checking you, you should have bought up 4head robbing you and no one doing anything about it🤷🏼‍♂️
[2:00:01] 1vivy: @riqui__ true COB, mayor, so many directions

[2:00:24] Bigeyez: @viewbotreportingforduty esfand doesn't know if cornwood will be allowed to do that. He is worried cornwood might get fired if he presents while being suspended

[2:52:36] red_eyed_jed1: I'll probably be timed out for this, but I think saab wants to farm den zel for content. willing to fire him to do it. twice he talks about welfare checks and how the streets want blood from den essaying
[2:52:39] Eyedea67: Cornwood needs to start the PD in little Texas

[2:55:45] crowquillz: her original character was basically just extra emily, some of it just a holdover from that i think
[2:55:46] afkbrb: isn't her character RPing as Extra Emily? TwitchConHYPE
[2:55:48] BDG_Toa676: Ahh
[2:55:51] Athasin: Idk I hear Dora the Explorer when she speaks
[2:55:55] BDG_Toa676: deansoPa
[2:55:56] macneutron: @red_eyed_jed1 He is trying to avoid 3.0 drama, where people complained cops didn't get consequences from fuckups, at one point it was called copixel
[2:55:59] theblackdog808: Jesus
[2:56:00] HajileX: that was some final destination shit rofl
[2:56:00] nathanarmstrong0: Tbf Deans old enough to know how they talked back then
[2:56:02] catfish_quackenbush: @Mystikalrush vigilantly, or civilian task force, or maybe security company
[2:56:05] MDM4ever1986HD: jheeeze
[2:56:10] tinywulf: why does that happen\
[2:56:18] DonnieDarkoTheD: As someone with a south Florida education  dean I feel like they did you dirty
[2:56:21] CrazyCrotch: She speaks like a Disney character lowkey from the old shows
[2:56:22] mattlau95: Swedish lady with yellow braided pigtails saying “yoohoo!!”
[2:56:24] MrSirDudeGuyBro: @tinywulf car was still there
[2:56:25] ramsin50: did she pay for the turbo?
[2:56:39] crowquillz: afkbrb yeah she decided to change the character when the real extraemily decided to RP, but kinda kept the speech patern
[2:56:42] catfish_quackenbush: i really cant wait to see what happens when Aziz finds out
[2:56:51] MrVitch: What all went down after the strike last night couldn't stick around to see what happened?
[2:56:57] afkbrb: @crowquillz HmmNotes

[2:57:29] longhorns2565: doctor arc
[2:57:30] Athasin: Yeah and he totally did that LUL
[2:57:31] catfish_quackenbush: lol Denz also told COrnwood to chill and we see wehre that went haha. but tbf, he was already being suspended
[2:57:31] BrockLeeSwag: he shouldve took all the turbos out
[2:57:35] ReflectionX: The PD Captains have decided that RP situations need to be handled the same way every time. Pretty lame if you ask me
[2:57:37] Mystikalrush: Dean told corn to chill and look where he's at now
[2:57:38] Kindunax: cornwood is gonna be a judge LULW
[2:57:42] kevez83: @BrockLeeSwag i think he did
[2:57:44] blamhim398645: does conwood even have clothes for his ped out of uniform?

[2:58:17] bluecheeeeeese: COPIUM
[2:58:19] BrockLeeSwag: @BrockLeeSwag I litterly went to bed it was too late then it all went to crap Sadge
[2:58:19] Athasin: Pollo already said if Azi gets fired he might become a lawyer to take down the PD
[2:58:21] catfish_quackenbush: yea its sucks that esfand was doing that to a 1lifer, just for the joke and such, but then the surrounding cops, didnt see it that way
[2:58:21] BDG_Toa676: deansoSpin
[2:58:22] R5F_: The DAP Squad has fallen
[2:58:24] tinywulf: imagine cornwood quits too
[2:58:28] alienx420x: 5 daps for 1 bullet is sus
[2:58:31] ArtificialHelix: If anything Azis is waiting for Sheriffs office to open
[2:58:33] washreyacolmsatt: when is the clip time
[2:58:44] insqnemagic: Cornwood, Sheisty and aziz needs to join the coming sherrif department
[2:58:50] iwannanuhh: @catfish_quackenbush No Fun Allowed
[2:59:02] ramsin50: @alienx420x it was because he kept mag dumping after he was down
[2:59:02] purplepoodle89: @ReflectionX at this point there's no way it's not intentional to make themselves the main antagonists, that was obvious with Ruth from the start, but now we've seen Slacks on that same shiit
[2:59:04] Athasin: Gotta catch Abdul
[2:59:12] MrSirDudeGuyBro: LUL
[2:59:17] Puncake: KEKW 󠀀

[2:59:27] Leafyerick: @ramsin50 It was specifically for the one extra bullet
[2:59:30] MrSirDudeGuyBro: snr buns take too long to make money
[2:59:32] Landoram: THey're striking for Cornwood..burger sales have fallen!
[2:59:33] RawerPower: Bush 23rd got revenge on Cornwood
[2:59:34] slight621: PD closed.... now this???
[2:59:38] Mystikalrush: Liberals took over
[2:59:40] catfish_quackenbush: @iwannanuhh yea the whole time he was saying to his chat, no way i get in trouble for that, its a 1 lifer, at some point, its about the content and just making it fun
[2:59:45] captain_steve_420: I predict Aziz will quit today. Forte and Leonard might too. Archer I could see quitting too, she was already thinking about it.
[2:59:49] thebogeym4n: I mean, at least cornwood has the civ firearm license
[2:59:50] purplepoodle89: @Smokay17 naw the PD is worse
[2:59:51] tinywulf: server be goin down
[2:59:52] Athasin: People eating rotten food in the sewers
[2:59:55] afkbrb: PepeLaugh jail heists
[3:00:03] iwannanuhh: The issue with the 5 daps is that there have been multiple excessive force cases so far and no-one else gets the daps for it. So it just reinforces the subjective dapping from the captains
[3:00:05] macneutron: @catfish_quackenbush Thats a bit of grey area, might f*ck them later if they let that slide, but maybe the 5 DAPs was too much
[3:00:16] Sneakystinkyratman: Turn Snr buns into a soup kitchen KEKW
[3:00:17] BDG_Toa676: @captain_steve_420 who plays Leonard again

[3:00:29] captain_steve_420: @BDG_Toa676 im not sure
[3:00:30] DanLGG: how did Cornwood manage to make out with a civ firearm license?
[3:00:32] thumeknight: what happened to snr buns for real?
[3:00:42] DonnieDarkoTheD: What's lame is that when the captains talk to people who are getting disciplined the best out come is that they don't get in more trouble. Theirs nothing that can say or do to make the outcome better.
[3:00:43] GalaxyDoesTwich: make your own order LMFAO
[3:00:47] Smokay17: Let's see if the fries work LUL
[3:00:52] BDG_Toa676: @captain_steve_420 Lenny hawk?
[3:00:53] slight621: @zla__ If that... might only be captains lol
[3:00:54] thebogeym4n: @DanLGG Crane just gave it to him
[3:00:55] Velehoh: @DanLGG beta tester for the civ weapon license
[3:00:58] catfish_quackenbush: @macneutron oh i def agree, he needed pusnishment, but like there is a time and place to do that type, but 5 daps yea
[3:01:03] Freddiepines: Leon aka Leonard is TheBigMeech
[3:01:10] Freddiepines: He's also Pilbis
[3:01:14] afkbrb: @thumeknight people yeeting jail food over the fence cos it's free
[3:01:14] captain_steve_420: @BDG_Toa676 Nah I see Lenny going out in a blaze of glory, trying to get daps lol
[3:01:14] Athasin: Know what's gonna be stressful, when you're a Probie who can't get 5 DAPs or you'll be suspended @dean
[3:01:15] macneutron: @DanLGG I think crane gave him to use when he is off duty
[3:01:26] BDG_Toa676: Oh thanks Freddie
[3:01:30] catfish_quackenbush: @DanLGG lol and a lot of 99/88 turbos he can resell on the open market for bank
[3:01:36] iwannanuhh: @DonnieDarkoTheD Slacks argued with him for 3 hours then at the end says "Welp we already all decided what is happening so heres 6 daps." Why even talk if thats the way they handle things
[3:01:37] red_eyed_jed1: damn $36 for cheese on bread
[3:01:42] BDG_Toa676: @captain_steve_420 that guy is jokes
[3:01:42] eliteone11: I think ya'll should burn the PD down. It would be great RP and its actually neede
[3:01:47] ArtificialHelix: No crim employment?
[3:01:55] MrSirDudeGuyBro: takes to long to make money probaly
[3:02:00] ajay311: Everybody tired of getting shanked
[3:02:02] ghettojokerr: lmao why just cheese bruh
[3:02:05] ghettojokerr: LUL
[3:02:07] condor2104: Cornwood suspended and no crims out lol
[3:02:10] Freddiepines: OKAY
[3:02:14] applejakxx: Did Denzel get fired??
[3:02:14] captain_steve_420: But yeah, the captains are enforcing "no win" rp whenever they decide to hand out daps. Bad RP. Toxic RP
[3:02:16] Athasin: @iwannanuhh Dude Slacks made Denzel wait 3 hours, took his food, and fired him.
[3:02:17] purplepoodle89: @iwannanuhh it's tooooootally subjective
[3:02:24] RawerPower: If SOPs say 5 DAP you can't negociate 1 or 3
[3:02:28] chmod_R_777: what happened to Speedy chat?
[3:02:32] nosebeersx: damn bro the buns is a fucking ghost town
[3:02:34] tehshoe: NAHH

[3:02:48] BDG_parth28: @chmod_r_777  on vacation
[3:02:55] red_eyed_jed1: it was pre-decided, you were right
[3:02:59] chmod_R_777: thats why Snr Buns is dead
[3:03:01] nosebeersx: they need to buff the burgers in here or something
[3:03:07] mattlau95: they need Ruth to manage Sr buns
[3:03:11] captain_steve_420: A Slacks redemption arc would be good content. But I have no faith in Slacks rn
[3:03:11] RawerPower: Are you ready to do Academy with Parmezan and Emily and fail?
[3:03:11] iwannanuhh: Slacks thinks the definition of disrespect is having a different opinion then him
[3:03:14] catfish_quackenbush: yea in IRL, its understandable, in RP, it looked really bad, waiting, then your shift captian didnt even show up,
[3:03:17] VioraX: why even fire denzel if he gets back in 2 weeks just disrespect
[3:03:18] CheeseMongerJet: that podcast was ooc, the waiting, taking your food and firing was all ic he fucked you there
[3:03:20] GalaxyDoesTwich: senor buns
[3:03:27] MrSirDudeGuyBro: i sat 3 hours on green with out the crew talking to eachother lol
[3:03:27] ramsin50: how's the snr buns stock looking like
[3:03:33] purplepoodle89: @mattlau95 she'd be stabbed within her first hour
[3:03:42] RawerPower: what if you fail Academy?
[3:03:46] slight621: Slacks had his priorities in order.. 1. podcast, 2. steal Den Zels food, 3. Fire Den Zel... (but not before robbing his food)
[3:03:57] thejain: Does Dean know that Cornwood got suspended? has seen them clips?
[3:04:00] Defonicx: surely
[3:04:03] cirocski: You could if Ruth's in charge of it
[3:04:05] ramsin50: you need to study the SOPs
[3:04:05] Belial2k: Clueless
[3:04:17] kevez83: @Deansocool did you take your omega 3 -6 - 9 fatty acid supplements today?
[3:04:19] ghettojokerr: 🍔
[3:04:23] DanLGG: In the long run I think this will be a good thing for pd and Denzel honestly. They show pd will have consequences. Denzel gets to come back with a fresh start. NO DAPS and no longer in shift 2
[3:04:24] tinywulf: Senior Buns, feeding the world
[3:04:27] captain_steve_420: MAKE SNR BUNS GREAT AGAIN
[3:04:29] BDG_Toa676: Doing America Great 2024
[3:04:35] thejain: personally, i always loved the vibes of Dean on the server!  <3 <3 hope he gets to RP the way he wants
[3:04:37] BreadPitt___: ?
[3:04:38] Sneakystinkyratman: Did cornwood ever tell what his master plan was he was hiding
[3:04:40] TheHoll0w: will you play Denzel in the next week? I feel there will be some spicy rp
[3:04:53] macneutron: @DanLGG *shift 1
[3:04:55] slight621: @DanLGG Den Zel wants shift 2... no more Ruth(less)
[3:04:55] purplepoodle89: @thejain i fell asleep listening to Cornwood telling slacks how the pd could be better and Slacks responding by getting personally offended
[3:04:56] hasan12q8: same
[3:04:56] ramsin50: they need to give snr buns employees a pay raise
[3:04:57] captain_steve_420: @Sneakystinkyratman I think it was the turbo thing
[3:05:04] Sneakystinkyratman: @captain_steve_420 YOINK
[3:05:05] blamhim398645: nice

[3:05:12] kevez83: off duty cornwood and denzel????
[3:05:14] Vorpalwarp: Den and Cornwood civ streams would be dope
[3:05:18] blamhim398645: oh right now
[3:05:19] Fabushki: but denzel doesnt know @Deansocool
[3:05:20] ChocolateMassage: ruth
[3:05:23] Vorpalwarp: but yeah not right now
[3:05:24] DanLGG: yeah y’all know what I mean. out of 1 into 2.
[3:05:25] captain_steve_420: Cornwood will be on in a couple hours
[3:05:26] mizzikk2401: denzel together with cornwood off duty
[3:05:27] chmbrs: cornwood isnt awake lol he went to sleep 4 hours ago
[3:05:29] Redoxok: Ruth bestie
[3:05:31] thejain: @purplepoodle89 well! there is so much stuff about PD that doesnt make sense, i dont even know what to think of Slacks! hmmm! tiring

[3:14:44] CyboargTV: It's gotta be at the top

[3:15:10] CyboargTV: If the Sheriff's Office is open, it'll have all of the most fun people there
[3:15:10] BDG_Toa676: COB
[3:15:11] pervertsniffer: this whole thing makes no sense considering Lenny made one of the worst pits I have ever seen and he was made to pick trash up for 30 mins
[3:15:11] Gundaree: @ReflectionX I think so too, and they can be captains of an empty PD then cry everybody left
[3:15:11] thumeknight: Conan
[3:15:15] anovergy: anovergy gifted a Tier 1 sub to mizkifsrecedinghairline! This is their first Gift Sub in the channel! 
[3:15:16] DanLGG: I mean slacks has already made changes and adjustments to daps because of how you got dapped

[3:15:27] duckkyyducky: PD needs a chief ASAP
[3:15:27] Freddiepines: They will absolutely can his ass
[3:15:27] thebogeym4n: Clueless
[3:15:28] mizkifsrecedinghairline: I think Cornwood is 100% getting fired after last night.
[3:15:30] thejain: interesting
[3:15:30] doggensteinn: i stayed up til like 4am watching. slacks is a brick wall. cornwood def getting fired
[3:15:31] kb420ps: I really wish the Sheriff's office opens with Cornwood leading,  and NO INTERFERNCE from the LSDP.  Let the sheriff's office be COMPLETLEY AUTONOMOUS.
[3:15:32] numbuh34: moon2Y mayor max will save the day
[3:15:32] hoanzlgoas: Remember the Times when Joe Parmesan was the biggest Problem for PD? :D
[3:15:36] zekonja17: cornwood will be fired
[3:15:36] bigpharmaa: he doesnt Know Aware
[3:15:37] Gundaree: Cornwood definatly gets fired there was no friendliness
[3:15:37] BDG_Toa676: Yep
[3:15:37] purplepoodle89: Last time crane came and saved the PD from Slacks after Slacks was killed (shot in the head) but then crane left 2 days later and the PD went back down in flames
[3:15:37] LogicWeasel: mhm  truuuue
[3:15:38] catfish_quackenbush: I honestly think Cornwood will get the boot, but i also think there will be a lot of change in the PD structure and someone in goverment over the captains
[3:15:38] JustinBinder: Belov officer cant run for it
[3:15:40] TheOGWombat: will esfand stay long term if he gets sherrif or eventually leave for variety?
[3:15:41] iwannanuhh: Nah he 100% will get fired
[3:15:42] RoyalShield99: I think Cornwood burned some bridges last night
[3:15:44] BDG_Toa676: Expeditiously
[3:15:44] d_o_g_o_: you dont have a job
[3:15:44] thejain: I personally dont want the PD to lose a good one like Denzel
[3:15:44] ToxicTaco11: YEP
[3:15:46] ninjamonkeypwm: You are jobless
[3:15:46] htran__: sad but true
[3:15:46] Zedowel: Johnson 2.0
[3:15:46] CazeyTV: true
[3:15:47] Leritt: !meta
[3:15:47] Fossabot: Don't tell Dean information about other characters that he does not know in game. He cannot do things if it is said in chat and he sees it. Sit back and just enjoy the rp.
[3:15:47] Paranti: Den is jobless?
[3:15:47] aman_afk: TRUEEEEE
[3:15:48] Eliminator_V: YOU ARE JOBLESS LUL
[3:15:49] tehshoe: i think esfandCOPS is fired tbh, dude went hardwood on slacks

[3:15:50] VenomVeinZ: arnt you already irl and in game @Deansocool
[3:15:51] lapte_lapte: absolutely
[3:15:52] salvoneth: if they fire cornwood they’ll fall apart he owns all the turbos in all the cars
[3:15:52] kaykay569: I think both if y be AT thé academy, it would be great
[3:15:52] Evezh_: @lemmytunngainus 12 hours 20 mins ish the talk on the roof
[3:15:52] nizmo_ttn: den zel kept his job for being a bitch fr
[3:15:52] theblackdog808: Yeah you did the right thing
[3:15:52] azncheesy: Johnson stood on business LUL
[3:15:53] jakeeighty: i yelled at my boss once irl and I got fired that same day so do not do that guys
[3:15:54] ErenSakura: Did you see the new police contuinity plan regarding mayor office reigning the police department ? @Deansocool https://www.reddit.com/r/RPClipsGTA/comments/1ax3d06/police_continuity_plan_maxs_plan_for_mayoral/
[3:15:54] ookz: Wait till Siobahn and Yung Dab hear Cornwood got suspended, its gonna be a shit show
[3:15:54] nathanarmstrong0: You are
[3:15:54] Superhank: if denzel had a backbone hed been out before johnson
[3:15:56] lemmytunngainus: nah you'd rich af doing crime
[3:15:56] REAPER_Replicator: Cornwood as sheriff , Conan and Tessa as Lt
[3:15:56] DanLGG: FACTS Because you say yes sir no sir.
[3:15:58] heftylefty_prime: Pray for Soze traumzPrayge
[3:16:00] CrutonArt: cornwood’s suspension is a slap in the face knowing he does the absolute MOST out of everyone at the PD
[3:16:00] not_rahk: @CazeyTV BONE SAJ
[3:16:00] Sir_Beardsley: you ARE jobless wtf
[3:16:03] Skycoh: Den Zel as 1st shift Commander for the BCSO. Captain Den Zel Sheisty. @Deansocool
[3:16:03] mizzikk2401: I am sure Ruth wants Cornwood gone
[3:16:06] kb420ps: @RoyalShield99 I think the Captains are the ones burning bridges.
[3:16:07] catfish_quackenbush: Lol Slacks said that last night that Denz conversation and Cornwoods conversation were complete opposites
[3:16:09] ReflectionX: No offense to you twitch streamers, but its blatantly obvious which ones did not play sports growing up (the captains LUL)
[3:16:09] turkey74420: true
[3:16:10] DeporeMX: like johnson
[3:16:11] FlyingBrains: curious @Deansocool  as a adult, did you ever think the decisions you have made would lead you to watching a video of another adult educating adults on the backstory of fictional ponies? :D hope you're well brotha
[3:16:14] BDG_Toa676: Yep
[3:16:15] jakeeighty: i yelled at my boss once irl and I got fired that same day so do not do that guys... be nice to your superiors
[3:16:16] NemoBlu: does Cornwood getting suspended affect his changes at LASO
[3:16:16] tinywulf: its bullshit that you have to walk around on glass
[3:16:17] nosebeersx: https://clips.twitch.tv/AntsyTenderYogurtPoooound-loCtq7Y6VuZUt95f
[3:16:18] Rascal_PM: honestly who even decided on these three captains? they accepted these roles but were nowhere near ready to be leaders. one of them is a teacher, doesn’t even have manager experience
[3:16:19] iwannanuhh: Cornwood will be gone because of that fact
[3:16:21] thejain: Denzel makes it fund interesting and good in the PD scene for everyone! i hope he gets back ! prayge
[3:16:21] coldbleb: NODDERS  Cornwood didnt do that
[3:16:22] MakiWind: She lied
[3:16:22] LogicWeasel: it's messed up how much Denzel had to bend the knee and say "yes sir may I have another"
[3:16:23] mizkifsrecedinghairline: Cornwood got an extra DAP for insubordination  LUL
[3:16:23] JustinBinder: @Deansocool they will find a way to make him not be able to run for the position
[3:16:23] blowaways: if they dont recognise where the problem is this time, there's no hope
[3:16:25] lemmytunngainus: @Evezh_ thanks cuh
[3:16:26] Frvnkzy: fight for your job- fired
[3:16:26] itsjonathanfl: you were fired dumbfuck
[3:16:27] theblackdog808: It's smart cause you're incgood standing while others do the beefing
[3:16:30] htran__: essaying
[3:16:32] keemotherapi: thats exactly why
[3:16:36] zekonja17: cornwood didnt take well suspension and thats why slacks will fire him
[3:16:36] macneutron: Get ur Clout up bro
[3:16:37] Blizzard5050: That whole interaction with Slacks Crane Esfand and Max was classic - when Max showed up with the legislation
[3:16:37] korporaal_langslang: It also works against you, Slacks used the fact that you didn't stand up as justification that he was right to fire you
[3:16:39] LogicWeasel: EZ you know it
[3:16:39] slight621: If they don't all quit by then
[3:16:42] doggensteinn: cornwood respectfully countered every argument slacks made, but he still got suspended
[3:16:44] Nights_98: You getting fired after serving the suspension doesn't make sense. Didnt the captains admit that Denzel was improving and learning from mistakes
[3:16:44] tinywulf: Aziz needs his back scrubber back
[3:16:49] reveryrevere: what if he gets rejected
[3:16:51] mathln: maybe collab w. Cornwood until Mars?
[3:16:51] Fabushki: imagine ruth changes to shift 2
[3:16:52] Spikedav: At least you are back to 0 daps now
[3:16:52] Fabushki: xdd
[3:16:54] Gundaree: nobody wants to deal with this shit, ppl acepting as they have no alternative but with a sherrif department they wiill jump ship
[3:16:56] Rascal_PM: they aren’t gonna hire you bro; they are being haters to you directly
[3:16:57] DanLGG: @deansocool you know that first statement Slacks said about Denzel being respectful etc came from Ruth
[3:16:58] kaykay569: Condude and Denzel AT thé academy gonna be intresting
[3:16:59] cody38544: I heard that cornwood might not be able to run because of DAP points
[3:16:59] kCblol: eh nothing will change if leadership doesnt
[3:17:02] azncheesy: xdd Aziz up next after cornwood
[3:17:04] coldbleb: Mlp is exactly what we need in the server today xdd
[3:17:04] kb420ps: The irony is that,  before all of this happened,  I would bet that Denzel and Cornwood have more hours in than Ruth, Slacks, and Turner combined.
[3:17:08] Redtwintails: @korporaal_langslang what did the legislation say ?
[3:17:11] mizkifsrecedinghairline: Poor Aziz.  Nobody left to scrub his back after a long day of work.
[3:17:12] Zedowel: Denzel's personality will make academy a cakewalk
[3:17:13] chmod_R_777: power tripin
[3:17:14] garageproject: @deansocool Real talk though is in do they not worry about how it could effect income in irl
[3:17:14] UchihaJesus: ifhe acts like a robot he might be back XD
[3:17:16] not_rahk: Had to uphold the system they put in place
[3:17:19] TheOGWombat: what i ooc don’t understand is why daps don’t expire based on hours on duty vs calendar days.
[3:17:19] purplepoodle89: this whole Tessa arc yesterday was HILARIOUS
[3:17:19] BLazOR_Prime: @doggensteinn cornwood was right when he said he rather talk to a wall
[3:17:20] CyboargTV: FTO's testing you in the ride-alongs gotta feel a lil insulting LUL
[3:17:20] BlindFlapjack: wait till Ruth changes to your shift xdd
[3:17:22] DanLGG: The only reason he got fired is because he was the first to 10
[3:17:24] RiasGremoryLoveHer: i mean you will still get bitched around by the incompetent captains
[3:17:24] ReflectionX: they fired you to scare the rest of the PD. Probably the worst decision they've made
[3:17:24] coldbleb: Moon was roasting turner yesterday KEKW
[3:17:25] MakiWind: All your Daps has lead to SOP
[3:17:25] blowaways: there's literally 0 point in firing you if you come back the week after for academy
[3:17:26] pervertsniffer: this whole thing makes no sense considering Lenny made one of the worst pits I have ever seen and he was made to pick trash up for 30 mins
[3:17:28] rohan_t8: @kb420ps facts all capt are useless
[3:17:30] cody38544: @kb420ps yup, 100%
[3:17:30] nosebeersx: https://clips.twitch.tv/PrettyStrangeGoshawkOSfrog-yk4dEZbpls4ODQNJ
[3:17:31] Silvertap: @Deansocool funny thing, u got more DAPs because u spoken respectfully, and captans thought u said the word respectfully to a senior oficer
[3:17:32] Riqui__: https://www.twitch.tv/esfandtv/clip/AffluentAliveRuffPupper-WlDcvS2PKDuFdstG
[3:17:32] aramel_blush: Turner coes back all PD gone xD
[3:17:34] doggensteinn: @BLazOR_Prime 100 percent
[3:17:34] dan1shb: LMAOOOO
[3:17:34] CyboargTV: Turner should have had a interm captain
[3:17:34] captain_steve_420: When Turner gets back I cant wait to see his reaction
[3:17:36] iwannanuhh: @korporaal_langslang Slacks practically said "Now Denzel took it bending over, now thats a man with respect for the captains" LUL LUL LUL
[3:17:37] LogicWeasel: Sadge  slack's PD
[3:17:40] BDG_Toa676: deansoPopcorn deansoPopcorn
[3:17:41] aman_afk: ABSOLUTELY
[3:17:42] nickdrawsstuff: Slacks has a great name because he's always fucking slacking
[3:17:49] ihannibal: DEAN STAND ON BIDNESS
[3:17:49] nebxhelix: slack was annoyed Cornwood was speaking to the mayor on behalf of the pd
[3:17:50] thejain: IC, does Slacks not like Denzel or is he just Ruth sided?
[3:17:52] Zealzeal: We need Turner back as soon as possible
[3:17:54] Leritt: not for long dw
[3:17:55] lawlkat: it's weird how brain broken slacks is
[3:17:56] purplepoodle89: @BlindFlapjack she's on duty 3 hours a week i wouldn't worry too much
[3:17:57] JustinBinder: And Slacks sucks up to Ruth cuz ppl dont like her
[3:17:59] macneutron: Den will have to write all the reports and do the grunt work as a cadet
[3:18:00] kCblol: Dean politicing like a stud... reality is theyre being dicks
[3:18:05] Egoisten: Did Ruth get demoted ?
[3:18:07] lawlkat: slacks is just a moron
[3:18:14] thebogeym4n: Slacks is a fkin brick wall
[3:18:14] Leafyerick: Slacks just givesd Ruth whatever she wants
[3:18:16] BLazOR_Prime: crazy how the mayor and the council rather go straight to cornwood rather than any captains
[3:18:17] theblackdog808: Yup
[3:18:18] Reniiiowo: People pleaser
[3:18:18] LogicWeasel: slacks spreads himself thin and thinks he's right
[3:18:18] tinywulf: i like slacks at first now i pretty much got no respect for him, and ruth i hate, lol
[3:18:21] grntcr: It really feels like OOC Ssaab doesn't get it though
[3:18:22] JustinBinder: and plasing the wrong ppl
[3:18:22] rohan_t8: hes making it 3.0 cops
[3:18:22] thejain: ok
[3:18:22] aman_afk: YEP
[3:18:23] slight621: I think Slacks is crooked tbh
[3:18:24] Rascal_PM: Slacks just wants to protect himself
[3:18:24] coldbleb: Hmm  sounds like what Baas would do
[3:18:25] Gundaree: Slacks only gets heated when Ruth is critized or his own actions
[3:18:25] kb420ps: @rohan_t8 If you look at it,  not from a RP perspective,  but from an IRL perspective,  that's COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS!!!!!!!!!
[3:18:26] pervertsniffer: too easy manipulated
[3:18:27] aman_afk: YUP
[3:18:27] tarun_21: Where was this energy on Den Zel
[3:18:30] lemmytunngainus: Slacks likes to be a nice guy when he need to be strict and pick a side YEP
[3:18:32] duckkyyducky: Too many people=Ruth
[3:18:32] RawerPower: It's not Ruth cmon! How both Den and Cornwood not realize how daps work by now? DAP are voted 3-0
[3:18:32] CyboargTV: I think the captains are being way to serious for a not so serious server
[3:18:33] thejain: yeah! it makes him look bad too!
[3:18:36] chmod_R_777: on DeRolo's pocket
[3:18:37] DanLGG: Ssaab gets it.
[3:18:38] ceeweezie: And that was Baas' demise in 3.0 no?
[3:18:40] zachmcbridle: I notice slacks won't take accountability for anything aswell
[3:18:40] Rascal_PM: nah he just doesn’t want to be the one to mess up
[3:18:42] rohan_t8: @kb420ps ok
[3:18:43] mizkifsrecedinghairline: Slacks is the attack dog and Ruth holds the leash.
[3:18:44] lawlkat: @Leafyerick @Leafyerick won't stop fucking my dad
[3:18:44] UchihaJesus: incompetent
[3:18:45] Freddiepines: 2 of the 3 captains are shit leaders Shruge
[3:18:45] theblackdog808: Good intentions with potential consequences
[3:18:48] hippieh8rlol: Ssaab himself is such a big teddy bear that it's tough for him to play a hardass like Slacks.
[3:18:49] YoshiTheDeeno: @Deansocool captains wouldnt be captains for long mayor is pushing legislation
[3:18:50] Leritt: @grntcr ^
[3:18:50] kroncman: so slacks is a ball fondler Hmm
[3:18:53] Blizzard5050: I just find him a bit too stubborn, and it can be hard to tell if it's in or out of character
[3:18:56] ihannibal: turner is the best of the 3 captains imo
[3:18:59] Leafyerick: @lawlkat true

[3:19:11] Doc_Shadow_MD: @CyboargTV they are playing cops and everyone else is playing Reno 911
[3:19:11] Nights_98: Yeah basically unjust. It sets a precedence.  Now others should also get fired after suspensions as well even if they dont deserve it
[3:19:12] Navigator_Nav: Did you read the new Police continuity plan? @Deansocool
[3:19:12] iwannanuhh: I think people give characters more credit then they should get because they dont want the streamer to get hate.... at the end of the day that just makes the character more hatable
[3:19:13] lawlkat: @Leafyerick major alpha move
[3:19:14] kCblol: theyre trying to be hard on the force, while not holding themselves accountable
