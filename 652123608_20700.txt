[8:34:02] LazySlothKing: @UberHaxorNova these plugins are meant for public servers, which usually have ranks set up and probably that the default rank that everyone else is set to doesnt have permission to use the commands

[8:47:21] EvidentlyNova: @uberhaxornova I've linked a plugin in Discord for you to check out, it's a permissions plugin that Nucleus recommends to alter the base permission; nucleus.rtp.base and set it to everyone instead of admins only, that's why you can RTP freely but others can't.

[8:50:28] SpencerSx: @EvidentlyNova monkaHmm as far as I remember ftbutilities which is part of the modpack has its own permissions/rank setup, wouldn't that work?
