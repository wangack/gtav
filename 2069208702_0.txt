[3:59:52] undef1ned__: Okay, fair point. But how does a  different colored house half a mile away from me impact the value of my house. That's something I can't wrap my head around.
[4:00:05] undef1ned__: Just because we're in the same neighbourhood
[4:00:29] undef1ned__: Just curious
[4:01:03] MysteryFran: I suppose we have similar things that give value to the houses in certain areas..but it‚Äôs mainly based on other things eg crime rate. not what colour you paint your house
[4:01:30] undef1ned__: @MysteryFran same here. I couldn't care less if my neighbour has a brown or white house LUL

[6:04:44] Shadow42020: you got tazers for a reason tho no?
[6:05:03] n1_majorlavon_: tazer immunity after 5 secs AINTNOWAY

[6:05:48] Aufan08: so it helps then
[6:06:15] maggiras: also that you taze people like 100 times and they still run and try to evade
