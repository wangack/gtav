[0:23:59] BoxFan112: It's fair though, you'd take a murder charge for anyone in the company, and get raided, you're loyal to a fault, you'd kill to help, it's maybe safer with someone else
[0:24:00] enigma23j: ott most sensible person in the company
[0:24:00] joedlrt_: ray the boys are making moves with this new house coming @Ray__C
[0:24:01] xgspidermonkey: OTT has put like 90k into the company, which is more than anyone, but I understand Ray's point

[2:47:37] socialistchris: Random and apologies if you've addressed this in the past, but given Raymond started a whole gang war for Ray Mond and it still didn't workout, do you ever envision an RP arc where Raymond turns on her? I know that's hard since you fuck with Rae the streamer, but it could be great RP if fleshed out a bit. I mean, look at the rooftop chat with April, Rae has shown she wants to really dive into RP this time around.

[9:05:29] JaiLotus: yup
[9:05:29] SageAzrael: yup
[9:05:30] INSANE_SX: @Ray__C But you also sell each part 8.5K . 7$ per circuit board = 14K which provides him 4 parts=34K and you only get 10K to make them. 34K(8.5K x4) -14K(7$ x 2000)-10K(amount Charged).So you are losing atleast 10K to be honest is huge. Make it 3.5-4K a part that way you would still be pretty good .

[17:59:43] T7Maikeru: ITS THE Z AXIS
[17:59:44] alexisofficiall: it’s the shadows
[17:59:45] bajbae: try increasing z by 0.01 on one of them so the meshes dont overlap
[17:59:45] SyncXmA: the textures are overlapping, so u need to differentiate the height by like 0.1
[17:59:45] Luxzie_: Copy the other floor?
[17:59:46] duckzsellquack: the z position needs to be changed
[17:59:46] becoolone: funny thing is jp will re do all of this lol

[17:59:58] stelexx0: Lots of ppl use smaller floors
[17:59:58] soluxxxxx: try decreasing one of the y values by .0001 @Ray__C  󠀀
[17:59:59] 1NF1N1TE_TV: Overlap objects scuff the lightning
[17:59:59] annoyedadhoc: !backseat
[18:00:00] RaycBot: backseat gaming gets annoying and may result to accidental !meta. This includes telling Ray how to RP and what to do next. Excessive backseat gaming may result in a timeout or ban without warning. So chill and enjoy the show. Thank you. STFU
[18:00:00] profYapper: @Ray__C make Z 26.02 for one of them
[18:00:05] Rational_Psycho: GIGACHAD Ray
[18:00:05] MrGoatsy: @Ray__C this is literally not a backseating thing my dude
[18:00:08] f4tihxyz: telling the fix = backseating
[18:00:10] Oozy24: i think it’s just the internal lighting properties. I’ve had this happen in applications. this is just a plug in that’s having issues @ray__c
[18:00:10] v0ided_2: Its the Z change it by .01
[18:00:11] superaimnova: maybe bcus its outside?

[18:00:22] khrow: what if you just put the stairs over there instead, then you dont need to worry about it
[18:00:23] cartheginian: go under
[18:00:25] flavouredsandenjoyer: maybe make one like 1cm taller
[18:00:25] SmoothCriminal0110: @oozy24 exactly that
[18:00:25] Fungool65: doesn’t read backseat chat*
[18:00:28] LoStupidoBannato: Probably a temporary visual bug
[18:00:30] Phoenix__08: Ray C Chat loves you (Backseat)
[18:00:30] IcyTimothyT_hitchthebest: It’s the light from outside the window ray
[18:00:31] shabibby: Good morning Ray, you still at it???
[18:00:32] floridadog: its because you have 2 reflective surfaces overlapping so close to the light
[18:00:32] cartheginian: lighye
[18:00:34] pacanaz: move one floor down by 0.0001 it will fix
[18:00:35] Hinatainn: overlapping plane clash each other. unless its solid color
[18:00:35] cameowanz14: It's the two lights you left below maybe?
[18:00:36] soluxxxxx: decrease the value by 0.0001 and it will fix @Ray__C i know what im talking :)
[18:00:37] karllee989: YEllow light
[18:00:37] zorbious: maybe delete save and then rebuild it @ray__c
[18:00:38] adst: it’s the light under the floor causing that
[18:00:39] cartheginian: lights
[18:00:40] aimsbadsoirun: dear ray, please read my backseat specifically. i am important. i am 1 month sub on a gifted sub. pls.
[18:00:40] MrGoatsy: @Ray__C add .01 until it is fixed, it is a common dev issue and that fixes it
[18:00:42] xEweman: rotation x 90 y 0 z 45
[18:00:43] ImpulseSpoon646: ohh is it the bottom lights that you tested? 󠀀

[18:00:46] s0liid: it'll probably go away by itself
[18:00:47] declancarter1999: MESH OVERLAP. U NEED TO RAISE THE ONES OVERLAPPING @Ray__C

[18:00:50] bran514: backseating = giving potential solutions D:
[18:00:51] mattress734: Still going holee
[18:00:51] blankedzodd: If you move the right down flush with wall should work
[18:00:52] cartheginian: yes
[18:00:55] soluxxxxx: decrease the value by 0.0001 and it will fix @Ray__C i know what im talking :) 󠀀
[18:00:55] K1SSEKATT: why do you use the xxl flooring?
[18:00:56] pacanaz: 1. Either move the floor so it doesn't overlap, or move it down by 0.000001
[18:00:57] sharkkiller007: It's the floor material
[18:00:57] fatalfoo_fn: @pacanaz This
[18:00:58] Codiak416: @Ray__C put the stairs in the dip where you wanted the kitchen, instead of the scuffed spot near the door.
[18:00:58] mattress734: White looks alot better
[18:00:59] nickdog320: kickstart my heart
[18:00:59] ZALATORAY: overlapping in engines causes this buy

[18:01:01] Gubbis_db000: ye
[18:01:01] zorbious: delete floor and rebuild it @ray__c
[18:01:01] LOLolsen: It's z fighting
[18:01:06] T7Maikeru: it’s called z fighting when the same floor is on the same z axis pls read it’s not the lights @ray__c
[18:01:06] ChillTyme: center the light sources
[18:01:06] LOLolsen: Google z fighting
[18:01:07] RibsGaming: change the z value by 0.000001 first. just try that
[18:01:07] calmcity: Yep
[18:01:08] MrGoatsy: @LOLolsen yup
[18:01:09] IndigoKaede: sims rp
[18:01:10] ItsJordanGM: @K1SSEKATT covers more area :)
[18:01:11] IcyTimothyT_hitchthebest: It’s shaders colliding with natural light from outside window
[18:01:12] Ivanoffz: i think its the overlapping
[18:01:13] jaysonletra: Place long table for meetings
[18:01:14] goofyfps: remove shader 1s
[18:01:15] pacanaz: move one floor down by 0.0001 it will fix
[18:01:16] flavouredsandenjoyer: its both floors reflecting the lightning @Ray__C
[18:01:16] HalfEsse: yeah having the lights all be baked rather than runtime would definitely keep things consistent
[18:01:17] SmoothCriminal0110: it’s a graphics problem with shaders and light
[18:01:18] MrGoatsy: @LOLolsen but he doesn't want help, he calls it backseating Sadge
[18:01:19] S1lVeRSaM: X will flame you for using this floor he said he hated it
[18:01:19] ragamuffen: Damn the house is looking sickkkk

[18:01:22] BigHomieLeek: white or the cream color best ones
[18:01:22] cartheginian: move lights and see?
[18:01:22] ZachTriesTooHard: i think the LED  is glitching through the floor
[18:01:24] reee_d: nah this happened to X yesterday. the floors can’t be on top of each other
[18:01:25] roamingrefugee1: prob overlapping
[18:01:28] mcrluvr20: can cyd help?
[18:01:30] floridadog: @Ivanoffz FirstTimeDentger
[18:01:32] FlowermouthFilms: remove yellow tube light
[18:01:35] F9Gamez: i mean really you need to use the smaller flooring, without overlapping, this is a common 3d texture issue, but offsettings by slight Z values may fix it
[18:01:36] kazylab: @Ray__C move one floor down by 0.0001 it will fix
[18:01:37] flavouredsandenjoyer: do like 0.00001
[18:01:37] Gumeet: 26.011
[18:01:38] pacanaz: make it even smaller
[18:01:40] pacanaz: 0.000001
[18:01:42] solarsky_0: ye
[18:01:42] cartheginian: its ok
[18:01:43] icecoldgold773: more decimals
[18:01:44] Zezinas: I think its because 2 floors are over lapping + light is casting a shadow (just a guess though)
[18:01:44] ChaoticSanity: doesnt help that if 5 people walk into a house, they see 5 different things
[18:01:45] MrGoatsy: @Ray__C change it to .00002
[18:01:46] imgalad: do 0.0001 @Ray__C
[18:01:47] tb007007: move the others

[18:02:06] picklegenetics: @Ray__C what state are you from?
[18:02:06] soluxxxxx: you just need to tweak like .0001 so it soend have the same rendering value
[18:02:06] cartheginian: bad flooring job KEKW
[18:02:08] reee_d: it can be the same height, just needs to not overlap as much
[18:02:09] profYapper: 000001
[18:02:09] beedoz01: 26.0001
[18:02:12] adst: It’s simply the light under the floor
[18:02:12] senitor_12: deffinetly lighting
[18:02:12] afooty1235: maybe the lights fk it up
[18:02:14] Zanbar: @Ray__C more decimals

[18:03:36] NickyG_17: fell asleep & then woke up & you’re still doing renos!
[18:03:37] LOLolsen: It happens when two meshes overlap within the same space, and the textures constantly phase through eachother called z fighting
[18:03:38] BlazingVollk: check PLACED and see if its still there but scuffed
[18:03:38] Pixels_name: @Ray__C look for a kitchen that fell off the map?
[18:03:38] FictionK: Put the kitchen and remove again maybe
[18:03:38] bunnycups1: @Ray__C Maybe Kitchen means you can make Drugs
[18:03:39] NightcoreCEO: @ray__c house stuff is so fun to watch, pls more of it :3 but do u really need 3 floors? i think it would look sooo much better with only 2 floors and without the height scuff and shit
[18:03:41] SurvivorPlayz999: CHECK PLACED?
[18:03:41] recrewt_: it's in the ether of your inventory
[18:03:42] fRodyy_: bottom flooring is a disaster JP
[18:03:42] SurvivorPlayz999: oh
[18:03:43] bajbae: i mean if it doesnt blow up then you know you can use 230
[18:03:44] Technijin: the yellow light, not the floor.
[18:03:49] xeoslugs2003: over lapping is causing it
[18:03:50] F9Gamez: move it in to the wall since it won't be seen since it's underground anyway, prevent it overlapping other floor parts
[18:03:50] cartheginian: bug
[18:03:50] bunnycups1: @Ray__C in GTA RP
[18:03:54] ahhjoshy: @Ray__C there might've been an update to mining rigs using more power and by refreshing it you updated it
[18:03:56] RapidIQ: check if it's 231 for your eyes
[18:04:01] Dooki3: MIGHT JUST NEED NAP
[18:04:01] NoDont: try putting it down and see if it goes above 231

[18:04:13] solarsky_0: @QuimS2 it would make sense wouldnt iot
[18:04:16] helixpyre84: Maybe its lights that are drawing more power?

[18:04:38] ali_alsaadi99: you can make the first floor up more
[18:04:38] declancarter1999: remove the layer tweaking, save, then go back and redo it @Ray__C
[18:04:38] Pixels_name: is there small floors?
[18:04:40] ThatBritMan: @Ray__C Might be able to add something which uses power and remove it again to 'force' a recalculation of power
[18:04:41] pacanaz: move the floor so it doesn't overlap to outside it won't show anyways
[18:04:42] jojo_s93: live 18 hours, probably awake for even longer

[18:04:47] NightcoreCEO: @ray__c house stuff is so fun to watch, pls more of it :3 but do u really need 3 floors? i think it would look sooo much better with only 2 floors and without the height scuff and shit
[18:04:48] ZachTriesTooHard: @mp3danger OMEGALULiguess
[18:04:49] jxonas_: They should add a tool where you can change the size of floors and stiff so it doesent clip outside
[18:04:49] man_bear_pig: maybe try placing again and seeing if it goes up ?
[18:04:51] fatalfoo_fn: it's called Z fighting, when assets fight over the same position

[18:17:24] SageAzrael: mhm
[18:17:25] RevMeerkat: it's power consumptions, it's a bill, like normal power

[18:17:31] MilkMeSenpai: Fighting over bill costs could be funny lol
[18:17:31] GloGangAbel: Yean an electricity bill
[18:17:32] RevMeerkat: power dosen't make anything blow up

[18:17:42] Foreex7: u guys barely have anything in the house
[18:17:43] Fishdoll_: or just power outage, shit won't blow IRL lol
[18:17:44] recrewt_: FANS
[18:17:46] edfed420: @Ray__C i think the power just has a limit where it will stop working after going over
[18:17:49] EsbrohBaby: where did the idea of the house exploding come from just curious
[18:17:50] recrewt_: FOR COOLING FANS
[18:17:50] Aaalmost: considering how early into 4.0 it is i'd be surprised if power even becomes an issue until 500+ at least
[18:17:51] wagtash: how do you know its a blow up situation ? @Ray__C
[18:17:53] ItsCas3: @RevMeerkat thats what i been thinking
[18:17:53] ropdriver: lighting is so scuffed
[18:17:56] obrogames125: To be fair it doesn't make much sense for a house to explode they would just cut you off if anything
[18:17:56] whosnext0: could also have a max power where it causes a blackout
[18:17:58] marshyq: there’s no shot they blow up. the whole city would be in ruins in no time KEK
[18:17:58] M4XIAC: !song
[18:17:58] Ceasaa3: X is just SCHIZO thinking shit will blow up from 70 power in a big big house
[18:17:58] Nightbot: The song currently playing is - Frankenstein (feat. A$AP Rocky) by Swedish House Mafia - @M4XIAC
[18:17:59] I_Gryffin_I: @RevMeerkat they are thinking maybe you can get raided if your powerbill is INSANE
[18:18:01] Scoobymane: venting system looks so sick bro
[18:18:02] coopermcarthur: @revmeerkat they do be overthinking it a bit maybe
[18:18:06] ATOHIDAN_: @EsbrohBaby guess from who LUL
[18:18:09] MilkMeSenpai: I think a fire could happen tho
[18:18:15] Nejider: was someone going to design the interior?
[18:18:18] elviz_u: Sensor lighting
[18:18:25] s0liid: try doing yellow lighting
[18:18:26] Danacky23: @Ray__C In a "normal house" it would just cut the power instead of blowing up? - How do you know it'll blow up though?
[18:18:29] RevMeerkat: <- electrician , cops dont give a shit of how much power you use @I_Gryffin_I
[18:18:30] TacoGaming_tv: DonoWall OTT
[18:18:32] whosnext0: Dance

[18:20:15] ATOHIDAN_: guys you have 100 lights
[18:20:16] tsinks: White walls look so good nice
[18:20:17] Ceasaa3: @JCerris yeah thats what I mean, if a kitchen alone takes 100+ then it isnt reasonable that anything would happen at 100
[18:20:17] coopermcarthur: exactly because there is no mayor
[18:20:18] Millionaire2K: city should tell people ngl
[18:20:23] RaycBot: Follow the insta  https://instagram.com/raycgaming
[18:20:35] Danacky23: @SageAzrael Hmm, unless he seen it in the dev notes. Pretty sure it'll just cost more or even turn off.
