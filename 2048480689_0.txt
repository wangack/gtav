[2:43:37] additiveinturds: hotdog shit
[2:43:38] ForgottenColeslaw: I love RDR2 but sometimes the characters control like they have weights on them
[2:43:40] 87morpheus: "It's realistic"
[2:43:41] Nokturn_: I have never had an issue with rockstar games
[2:43:44] CyberHallway: it

[2:43:53] MrSilentBard: Nah Rdr2 fucking suck, Too many buttoms KEKW
[2:43:53] topsyturdy: it's like your buttons inputs are suggestions instead of orders
[2:43:58] AlizarinRed: because of big dumptrucks the characters have /s
[2:44:00] Dogbot3000: It's never been good chat
[2:44:01] DomunDomunDomun: Dumb euphoria physics engine.
[2:44:01] hugglebuggs: it's because you're built like a tank
[2:44:03] punchtiger: pressing a button and accidentally curb stomping an old woman npc
[2:44:08] antichristianne: chatter never ran their horse into trees LUL
[2:44:09] Despayeeto777: bro is on keyboard
[2:44:09] RosstheBossy: Time to starve to death before we even get there
[2:44:10] Cornjeebus: death stranding did walking great
[2:44:11] BlulesBlue: if the character instantly turns to another direction like mario its "less realistic"
[2:44:15] ppstainedgamerjorts_: they managed to fit tank controls into modern games CLUL
[2:44:16] basedpilled_chatter: Idk why but i love it and RDR2 is great, suck my nuts GLUCKTWERK
[2:44:22] MoonlightSteps: it is
[2:44:22] vanitynotpride: true
[2:44:22] borrelias: in rdr2 i'll press "w" and he will go a certain distance regardless of how long i press it. like he drifts
[2:44:23] itz_soki: bro is faded fr fr
[2:44:24] kkangstar: it plays like the center of mass is on player's head
[2:44:26] dungna_: Yes it is
[2:44:27] MangoJuiceDLX: you'd be hearing a thbthbthbthb sound if you had a flat
[2:44:27] Dogbot3000: It really isn't KEKW
[2:44:32] FecalSac: i haven't had an issue with it ever tbh but i get the sentiment with 5; 5 sucks in general
[2:44:36] LeehamAndEggs: you should torch the car in an alley
[2:44:38] IsaacMalus: You have gears in the bottom left over your speedometer are you sure you're not manual?
[2:44:39] kaiser_fecalfunny: I am of the firm opinion that rockstar games are mid. gorgeous enviroments, but everything else is mid
[2:44:40] osokamu: I love the way snake controls in MGSV
[2:44:41] Nokturn_: I hate how floaty other games feel compared to rockstar games personally, I like the weightiness
[2:44:43] borrelias: they feel like they have so much fuckung mass on them
[2:44:45] Nevercanth: human beings with the carrying a 4 gallon jug of water inertia
[2:44:46] FecesEatingGrin3125: YES IT FUCKING IS BETTER LOL
[2:44:50] Dogbot3000: Chat, just because you're used to it doesn't make it good
[2:44:50] Reverend_Poopsax: yeah, it's almost better on keyboard because you can at least aim properly with the mouse
[2:44:52] BigRaymcnd: tank controls CHUGLEPSY

[2:45:09] Meme_exe: YEP
[2:45:12] kkangstar: jmikeIsright
[2:45:13] BigRaymcnd: jmikeIsright
[2:45:14] RorBoy: GTA4 driving was UNPLAYABLE
[2:45:18] borrelias: its abhorrent that they havent improved on them
[2:45:22] RorBoy: no seatbelt was madness
[2:45:26] foxipepin: it's very weird at first, at least for rdr2
[2:45:30] OboroDigital: rockstar games control like everyone has just freshly dropped a deuce in their pants
[2:45:33] torgo_master: The floaty cars and weird momentum ruined the modern GTA games for me
[2:45:33] basedpilled_chatter: @dogbot3000 But its good though, seeing arthur tumble over and die is comedy gold KEKW
[2:45:34] RakanishuFoo: Is he using a controller like you're meant to?
[2:45:36] grimep_00: @Jabroni_Mike you think gta 6 will improve any of it?
[2:45:39] autofecalectomy: fuck you gta4 driving ruled
[2:45:45] topsyturdy: LUL
[2:45:45] Reverend_Poopsax: it feels like they prioritized animation smoothness over being able to move the character properly
[2:45:47] waldosmilksnake: LUL
[2:45:48] kkangstar: YEP
[2:45:48] CyberHallway: can't wait to mash the button to sprint in gta6
[2:45:49] AlizarinRed: Yeah, the controls for the character SUCKS ASS. There walking basically has SMOOTHED walking which is REALLY bad for small areas an turns.
[2:45:49] MollyThreeTails: Rockstar games move like soup
[2:45:50] veilsnow: No GIGACHAD
[2:45:51] foxipepin: hell no
[2:45:54] kaiser_fecalfunny: it will probably make it worse
[2:45:54] Dogbot3000: @basedpilled_chatter Just because you're right doesn't mean you're correct OMEGALUL
[2:45:56] Sonicplys: Skill Is
[2:46:00] sol_p_b: gta 6 will be the same shit, i could be wrong but i will not be surprised
[2:46:00] FecalSac: @autofecalectomy I know it's mega unpopular but i wish 4 driving became the standard
[2:46:00] Vicho_bocho: thye like it that way
[2:46:01] RorBoy: if RDR2 is any indication, it will be worse
[2:46:04] pixelminstrel: Will you still play 6 though?
[2:46:06] peachy_froggy: hey at least its not mario sunshine
[2:46:06] basedpilled_chatter: @dogbot3000 OME
[2:46:17] amidtheroar: hey mike i just wanted to say we apreciate u
[2:46:19] Vicho_bocho: @peachy_froggy what=
[2:46:19] Wonder_Punk: they add in a bunch of animations that make it feel like you're not in control
[2:46:20] Coleycow: many people are saying this
[2:46:24] BlulesBlue: again, they make the character slow on everything to be "realistic" they don't turn instantly, they have to slow down and shit like that, i don't like it too
[2:46:25] borrelias: trying to face one specific direction and arthur morgan will looks 25 degrees to the right or left but not the actual direction
[2:46:26] 87morpheus: Didn't Witcher 3 have something similar and CDPR had an option to fix it?
[2:46:28] topsyturdy: they're scared it would look "unrealistic" if you could turn on a dime
[2:46:33] ppstainedgamerjorts_: I will perpetually be angry at rockstar for not giving rdr2 a director mode Madge
[2:46:33] Nokturn_: It's intentional, they're not going to change it
[2:46:36] grimep_00: but mike, realism
[2:46:43] larimarrr: many such cases
[2:46:44] speeedra: rdr2 also has super inconsistent movement speeds
[2:46:45] peachy_froggy: @vicho_bocho sunshine controls feel like buttering corn with your penis, as vinny once said
[2:46:45] osokamu: many such cases
[2:46:47] kkangstar: jmikeIsright
[2:46:47] CosmosCellars: I'm playing Red Dead Redemption 2 right now. My character and horse will regularly go in the opposite direction despite me forcing the controller
[2:46:48] 87morpheus: jmikeIsright
[2:46:49] M_uT3: Mike is right
[2:46:49] chewyrock: modCheck
[2:46:50] BitzyMouse: jmikeIsright
[2:46:51] hypn0toad5: deadass
[2:46:52] bouge1085: mike is right

[2:46:55] Vangoatt: YOu got jmikeChatoid s agreeing :)
[2:46:55] veilsnow: jmikeIsright jmikeIsright jmikeIsright
[2:46:55] punchtiger: mike is absolutely right
[2:46:56] stukamod: People are tend to be wrong
[2:46:56] ed3800: have you tried first person? it's still loose and floaty but it's an improvement over 3rd person
[2:46:58] CoalTen: mike has never been wrong once on stream
[2:46:58] dwengz: it's true, it's too tight
[2:47:03] hoytess: no u
[2:47:03] vanitynotpride: monkaS
[2:47:07] BlulesBlue: i don't think the controls are bad but i hate them, so mike is right
[2:47:08] AlizarinRed: Like, if you need to turn left you don't NEED a full ass fuckin Tractor Trailer Wide Turn.
[2:47:12] roboticrocker707: mStare
[2:47:13] 8bitbeetle: Stares

[2:47:16] jovies_99: what what does a kiss taste like?
[2:47:17] 87morpheus: Brother
[2:47:23] AinsleyFaceXD: Marnie's buying stolen goods now?
[2:47:23] foxipepin: she gave a lil kissy poo
[2:47:24] borrelias: rockstar games feel less like i AM the character and more like i am a parasite in the characters brain struggling for control of the body
[2:47:24] Vangoatt: But you would like GTA SA controls, your player has no momentum like in this
[2:47:24] peppermint_rain: even if jmikeIsright I don't mind it too much
[2:47:27] Nevercanth: it's just weird that human characters not on mounts or in a car play like that damn horse from shadow of the colossus
[2:47:27] MangoJuiceDLX: @ed3800 first person changes your character's stance, it's hard to RP like that
[2:47:28] Vicho_bocho: @peachy_froggy BUH
[2:47:40] basedpilled_chatter: KEKW
[2:47:42] Cackeyee: maybe you're just a bad driver
