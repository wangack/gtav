[4:10:25] marcsfat: @TwhyLer14 I believe he got to the next intersection, and I'm guessing the aliens are because of the bags that actually have stuff in them

[4:11:30] TwhyLer14: @marcsfat I was kinda wondering if he was directly below the courthouse/south side area or if it’s actually the trash. server having major issues rn
[4:11:31] marcsfat: For no reason in particualr, what is your sani rep?
[4:11:31] 3_A_B_C: @st0rmblessed__ https://open.spotify.com/track/2Guj4HKiwv4P9F2N1rpeWL?si=c1ae997429734e42&nd=1&dlsi=d30ff8bb935a4601

[4:12:16] PulsarPuppy: would be cool if you got enough sewer rep or something that you could get an item or a bp that makes it easier to survive the sewers
[4:12:17] VengeanceUM: hey doc i need medical attention i broke my chest Sadge
[4:12:24] suebae: They'll probably adjust it next storm or something I think the DOT damage is stacking
[4:12:25] marcsfat: @TwhyLer14 I think since this was just added, its the problem. My bet is the stuff in the sewer is directly below the southside
[4:12:25] iiihitman47iii: sewers = rad town from rust

[4:13:27] TwhyLer14: @marcsfat was the sewer stuff there yesterday? i know there was some major headpops by the courthouse yesterday too but maybe that was something to do with the house bills being added
[4:13:28] Regis025: some people can’t load nopixel like sykunno

[4:14:24] Zezoww: halloow
[4:14:25] woulf76: If they doubled doctors' pay, it wouldn't be enough.
[4:14:25] marcsfat: Southside is causing massive headpops, and I think deeper in the sewers is under Southside. Sykk couldn't get back on after he crashed
