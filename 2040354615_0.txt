[7:42:00] Tur4no: If Tony and Lang start to do stuff together will the scuff exponentially grow or will it cancel? hmmMeeting
[7:42:00] CYDERVERSE: @MAZM0L The race times vary from time to time. It's usually confirmed by The Driver an hour or two before it happens. So a command wouldn't always be accurate
