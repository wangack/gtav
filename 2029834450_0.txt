[0:20:20] rextenisonx_x: Cheer100 Cray i wanted to say also a thing to you. I have seen you talk a lot about your mom and how important she is in your life which got me thinking a lot. I met my love life and she is a black. She and mom did not get along and she doesn't want me to marry her because of her skin color. Don't get me wrong i love my mom a lot and she is a nice person but i don't know what kind if idea she has in her mind. How would you react if you were in the same situation.
[0:20:27] rsyncd: hottub streamers mhm

[0:21:27] bear11k: facts
[0:21:38] CrimsonCarnotaurus: @mariokartproo you must remember there are different appeals to different streams, some may like the community aspect and engagement of Twitch so a smaller and medium sized streamers would be more appealing
[0:21:38] double_twoseven: Fax

[0:22:03] tthugnasty: twitch turbo is 10 dollars a month and gets rid of adds across all streams
[0:22:03] BurlapSackss: The ads ruin the momentum of the stream
[0:22:05] its_c29: ads on twitch take away from the streamer I agree with what your saying

[0:22:28] thatmetalhead9000: death of thousand of cuts
[0:22:29] mellonhead97: I think part of it might be there's nothing like a like button or heart like on a lot of other social media that's a quick sign of good reccomendations for the algorithim, twtich only has subs to go off of so i feel like they don't have a good way to tell what streams they actually enjoy other than subs
[0:22:35] Daen25: Angel, bear Yo

[0:23:44] S1llyWomen: the follow age doesn’t work:(
[0:23:45] SuaveCeelos: do you think it’s also that twitch has their hands tied because of Amazon ownership and they cannot prioritize discoverablity because they need ads to push product and subscribers @crayator
[0:23:51] xxDentwitchxx: Did u see YouTubers are quiting now days @crayator
[0:23:52] its_c29: or like with YouTube memberships I hate it bc I don’t want to have to pay to watch more videos of my subscriptions bc I feel like it’s unfair yk

[0:26:01] YaBoyNoskii: @drkangel___ the FYP isnt a right if you're a big creator, you still gotta make good videos which allows smaller people to be discovered also

[0:27:18] CrimsonCarnotaurus: Maybe you should experiment with a YouTube stream and see how the numbers look when you gain some momentum from video uploads. Some who do both seem to be getting decent comparable numbers to their Twitch stream
[0:27:18] torokefe: this is the 3rd time ive come from instagram and always disappointed
[0:27:20] georgetechlive: but you still need to convert them to twitch viewer.
[0:27:22] MoneyTwit: they become the biggest fuck head for not doing it right ok
