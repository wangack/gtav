[0:28:44] Thallo_Auxo: The laws in NP are usually written with an element of vaguity to allow for appeals/court RP. If the laws were written like IRL laws are, that leaves little discussion or debate. Then the laws can be updated and case laws written peepoHappy

[1:36:12] gingerbeardproduction: im less than a year type 1 its rough hope i get a pump

[1:41:00] gingerbeardproduction: @the_androids trying bro nhs moves slow
[1:41:15] Thallo_Auxo: How do you get tegaderm, patches etc to stick for longer? I'm not diabetic but I have to have tegaderm on my arm covering a 7 day patch and I'm struggling to keep it on for more than 4 days.

[1:42:24] gingerbeardproduction: its free sure but a pain sometimes
[1:42:41] The_Androids: @Thallo_Auxo Skintac helps. Both my pod and cgm have extra patches to help keep it stuck. Also I sometimes if its an arm site, wrap with bangage wrap when its really loose

[2:15:29] Celesia: Someone said Cornwood brings the scuff
[2:15:31] original_khawk: christoWait
[2:15:34] Celesia: So the scuff went from Buddha to Cornwood?
[2:15:52] Thallo_Auxo: Its the gravitational pull of his belleh

[2:17:26] Celesia: I wonder if they did some updates Hmmmm
[2:17:29] yaboizelda: @yeslewd nah that sever that garage is scruffy as hell
[2:17:57] yaboizelda: it‚Äôs been having headaches since 3.0 the garage they were at
[2:18:01] SilentStormAU: it took xice (whose doing PD interviews) a few trys to get back in NODDERS
[2:18:43] jamieddd: @SilentStormAU yea benji was struggling to load serve too.
[2:18:48] Celesia: That guy looked like he was flapping his arms to fly

[2:21:11] Celesia: Hmmmm They listed teh cat blapping emote as unsafe.
[2:21:29] DangersClose: @SilentStormAU Curious to hear what Rhoades thinks on it he a OG cop.
[2:21:33] Kasvar: TRRRRRRRRRRR take the shot
[2:21:36] Thallo_Auxo: @Celesia Too powerful NODDERS
[2:21:36] nbunara: For some reason I thought the emote was something like cat with a gat, but I don't think that's right KEKW

[2:22:26] original_khawk: ziggyjWait
[2:22:27] yeslewd: Sadge
[2:22:27] wrucewayn3: so a statement from a victim can lead to police shooting perpetrator?
[2:22:40] EntiNZ: they saw the gun
[2:22:54] DangersClose: So they would of had to negotiate for no shooting to not get shot here?
[2:23:05] wrucewayn3: they did
[2:23:05] BakinPacman: gunshot wounds means they most likely have a pd weapon this early on
[2:23:06] Celesia: No one will ever negotiate for that
[2:23:17] Celesia: Safe passage is not "no shooting"
[2:23:25] Celesia: Safe passage is "Don't shoot our asses as we get into our car"
[2:23:25] ShazerGaming: as soon as the hostage is safe the bargaining is void
[2:24:04] DangersClose: I agree 100% in RP. But OOC for server health shouldnt there be certain rules, because now what will happen next time, negotations will never be beleived?
[2:24:17] Zhachi1250: The los santos special
[2:24:23] Akizakiz: @wrucewayn3 they saw a victim jump from water tower and slack talk to victim confirm they force him to jump or get shot. then the shot to kill was made
[2:24:28] BakinPacman: but a robbery usually meant the hostage was not already shot
[2:24:28] DumboTheWise: Free spike strips no passage NODDERS
[2:24:39] Thallo_Auxo: Free pasta! No spices!
[2:24:43] AloofMango: @DumboTheWise classic dumbo
[2:25:05] Celesia: Sometimes criminals will even be like "Hey, we won't use motorcycles if you guys don't do X"
[2:25:44] BakinPacman: the criminals have to "TRY" basically
[2:25:52] Mitashkii: noted, always carry spare hostage in the trunk Kappa
[2:25:54] Switchblade142: the negotiations were also already honored, they gave free passage which was what was given
[2:26:02] DangersClose: Nah i agreew with you makes sense 100% in RP. I just think from now on if they have already hurt a hostage before police arrive they will never try to negotiate again
[2:26:08] Zhachi1250: @DumboTheWise Sounds like the 4head special, nah dog I want you to spike all my tires before we start the chase
[2:26:20] yeslewd: then dont hurt one
[2:26:24] BakinPacman: they should not have stayed so close to the scene to be honest KEKW
[2:26:27] smallboysaige: Well yeah thats just a part of rp
[2:26:42] BakinPacman: the cops will circle outwards from the scene
[2:26:45] DangersClose: But its not a bargaining chip if they know as soon as they hand them over they will get shot because of the other hurt hostage
[2:26:46] Switchblade142: @dangersclose But they already did negotiate and they wanted free passage, and they were given free passage. I don‚Äôt understand what part of the negotiations wasn‚Äôt honored.
[2:26:56] DumboTheWise: @DumboTheWise Nah... 4head just try to sell Rhodes whatever he got
[2:26:59] Fishnet83: In this case they wouldnt have gotten to the car if they did SHRUGGERS so they did get something out of it
[2:27:05] ShazerGaming: The only difference is the judgement call they made to throw the guns out of the window
[2:27:08] BakinPacman: its possible
[2:27:13] drvinnie_boombat: Just let all criminals go please. Kappa
[2:27:14] BakinPacman: its just supposed to be hard
[2:27:22] DangersClose: yeah it was dumb af to be that close for real
[2:27:30] Zhachi1250: @DumboTheWise RPG for 10k is a hell of a deal, what can we say LUL
[2:27:33] BakinPacman: they shoulda been in paleto etc
[2:27:34] BakinPacman: LUL

[2:28:25] StreamElements: Come join CurvyElephant's Discord at http://discord.gg/curvyelephant and his Twitter at https://twitter.com/CurvyElephant
[2:28:36] ShazerGaming: they also threw the guy off the tower right in front of cops
[2:28:47] BakinPacman: yeah throwing the guy off was oops
[2:28:56] CustomGoods: shooting is lame tho i understand why some chatters get salty i dont agree with spewing hate tho
[2:29:04] Mitashkii: @ShazerGaming the guy jumped himself Kappa
[2:29:15] BakinPacman: the fact that crims have guns this early is the other issue
[2:29:26] yeslewd: they are stolel pd guns
[2:29:30] yeslewd: prob
[2:29:34] Thallo_Auxo: Stern words NODDERS
[2:29:38] ceego: I mean even if part of what dangers says does happen and they dont negotiate it just means the rp goes a different route and thats just how it be

[2:30:13] BakinPacman: i wonder how the pd would handle it if they offered to give up the guns before the chase started
[2:30:14] Celesia: I think it was a lowkey dig at cops, Meego

[3:47:46] JediChickens: @slowixe shooting cops is not against server rules, just need to live with the consequences within the RP
[3:47:49] thatclubdj: All this is really subtly implying is there's prob a different gun to investigate him for lol
[3:47:49] StephyFace: lmfao @ this chatter saying cops can never shoot LUL
[3:47:49] mrperson1234: @luscinii Counter to what? Police are putting hostages in danger because of this shit situation. Before this police could get hostages completely away from dangerous criminals. Now hostages have to be taken with the criminals and if cops fail to catch them the hostage dies. It is a fuck up on the Pd's part there is no way around it
[3:47:52] reelodintv: Hi curvy <3
[3:47:53] Arujon: @aiiiR_ but if the grounds he shot at least once before throwing away the gun, would it affect the test?

[3:49:11] Celesia: Honestly at this point, Jean Paul doesn't need a lawyer. The lawyers are just an audience at this point
[3:49:13] tobs74: JP forgetting he called slacks and said the hostage would die LUL

[3:50:52] imhughamongus: @celesia it's reasonable to assume you won't get shot at, the circumstances changed rightfully so and he can't see that. He is bricked into thinking cops always lie cuz in RP well they do

[3:51:39] nationas: he has no gun charge LUL
[3:51:40] innoculant: wow these chatter are fucking braindead
[3:51:42] mrperson1234: @luscinii They had a hostage they let the hostage go because they were told they would not be shot at. If they knew they would be shot at they would have forced the hostage into the car and then killed her after espacing
[3:51:48] hollowrust: im a bad egg
[3:51:54] miketwng: free passage is not a pass to be free
[3:51:55] Celesia: Not a bad egg curvyeShocked
[3:52:02] thatclubdj: @celesia if the crazy 1% didn't exist life would be boring lol
[3:52:09] Celesia: Free passage isn't a get out of jail free card. That would be sooo awful.
[3:52:11] TropicalToucan: No one is charging him for that murder LUL
[3:52:20] Vlasvilneous: good luck

[3:52:44] am_kuro: KEKW
[3:52:44] mrperson1234: @Janizki_Fin Yes, which puts future hostages in danger

[3:53:30] wafiy637: all the pic hahaha
[3:53:32] hollowrust: yaboizelda didnt he have 3?
[3:53:35] TheJubJubBird: Guy just wanted to take the quick way down, who could blame him.
[3:53:41] yaboizelda: @hollowrust I thought he had 20
[3:53:44] yaboizelda: LOL ngl
[3:53:45] luscinii: @mrperson1234 yes and they couldve bring the hostage with them so PD can't apply lethal force. You are arguing RP situations here, don't blame cops if these crims can't think that far
[3:53:54] Celesia: Multiple people tested positive for GSR, with the power of deduction, that means there were multiple guns
[3:53:54] modooc56: just go and search the area then right?
[3:53:54] Janizki_Fin: @hollowrust no and also this is getting metaiy
[3:53:55] mrperson1234: @uhSnow Hostages are definitely in more danger being taking into an escaping vehicle than they are by being released before the chase in exchange of not being shot at.
[3:53:55] AnticrosslandDraws: So, how hard has he implicated himself in the however long time span this has gone on?
