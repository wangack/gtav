[6:57:11] harmonyg95: This might be a really dumb question but can you, the streamer/player, go and search up the periodic table to find out what the symbols are or is that meta gaming in a sense?
[6:58:02] tyronethebigg: Vd...
[6:58:20] hinksy2343: not there
[6:58:20] tyronethebigg: He's got no clue what any of those words are
[6:58:32] BarefootCvntessa: never heard of it
[6:58:58] EpicTaffy1: might not be the periodic table
[6:59:12] tyronethebigg: It might be a compound so not a element
[6:59:22] ph1995: Vanadium is V and top left in the violet section
[6:59:34] ph1995: third at the top violet row
[6:59:39] BarefootCvntessa: its V not Vd
[7:00:53] Aardapple1991: moonshine is ethanol and the formula is ch3chh2oh - google helped here
[7:01:25] PhaseLord773: vandium is not VD
[7:01:42] BarefootCvntessa: alchohol is orgnic chemistry so would not contain metals in the first place
[7:01:42] tyronethebigg: Vanadium is V
[7:01:43] ph1995: the 50 and 51 is not the atomic number
[7:01:51] tyronethebigg: @barefootcvntessa ^
[7:01:51] StreamElements: ^
[7:02:03] rexyyyy_: just get a periodic table LMAO
[7:02:03] exr_vivid: @BarefootCvntessa ^
[7:02:04] StreamElements: ^
[7:02:09] ph1995: 23
[7:02:22] PhaseLord773: because its not a vd its just a v
[7:02:23] ph1995: Vanadium is V not Vd, and its periodic number is 23
[7:02:34] rexyyyy_: o I haven’t been paying attention icl LUL
[7:02:52] ph1995: Nd is at the bottom blue row, 3rd from left
[7:02:53] BarefootCvntessa: V is right there above Nb
[7:02:55] EpicTaffy1: Vd might be an acronym for something like Vapor density
[7:02:56] elitewarrior579: try alphabetical order
[7:02:58] ph1995: atomic number 60
[7:03:30] tyronethebigg: Is it Vd or 2 capital letters because if so that's 2 elements
[7:03:43] ph1995: V for Vanadium is basically straight up, and number 23, but there's not a Vd
[7:03:49] BarefootCvntessa: @EpicTaffy1 ^
[7:03:50] StreamElements: ^
[7:03:51] EpicTaffy1: VD or Vd
[7:03:57] tyronethebigg: ^

[7:13:59] exr_vivid: @HoneyKittyBooBear Can confirm
[7:14:04] phatquavers: I had moonshine once and after like 4 drinks I couldnt remember anything aha
[7:14:07] ollie_draper: moonshine is ethanol
[7:14:10] mfammoney: if moonshine is made the wrong way it will make you blind
[7:14:13] HoneyKittyBooBear: knew stevie wonder was an alchy
[7:14:29] ollie_draper: just purified to a different level depending on quality
[7:14:31] J_Harris18: LUL

[7:17:15] ollie_draper: Matt ethanol is made of carbon oxygen and hydrogen in a 6:2:1 ratio
[7:17:28] tyronethebigg: Since when did you put mouldy sweetcorn cobs in a moonshine recipe
[7:17:55] ollie_draper: @susanorvarlo sugars to ferment innit

[7:19:36] ollie_draper: 6:2:1 is ratio of hydrogen to carbon to oxygen for alcohol

[7:23:13] elitewarrior579: try 2 water 4 bread 2 fruit 4 corn because when making alcohol you want to have starch and the
