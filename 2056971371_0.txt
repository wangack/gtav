[0:33:13] Remizzle: + onx have ¬Ω of the old PD

[0:33:49] Astral_Rage: Cornwood would never respect crims KKonaW wtf
[0:33:49] Mogvvai4Sale: Sometimes that respect becomes an implied nod or wink though.
[0:33:50] goodtimes54: its weird how 15 year old game has changes a number of streamers life in a major way
[0:33:51] Vexamas: And I think this is why people have rough patches with xqc, because sometimes x will just lash out irrationally (even with personal connections OOC)
[0:33:53] evilmnkey4: who is cyr Kappa
[0:33:54] TheLadyCupcake: kappa
[0:33:54] EWDijkstra: makes it more fun for the streamers too when they're watching clips and seeing what's going on OOC
[0:34:00] LogicWeasel: you don't have to worry about covering your ass if you know Ramee won't try to screw over cornwood in bad faith
[0:34:01] EsmanTV: Seatbelt Classic
[0:34:03] slatt5: good faith RP is great for stream/the server it seems
[0:34:11] roshamb09: the goal should be how to make it more fun for everyone

[0:47:49] sammelweis: Ramee was the lawyer on this case - he played them so hard in the cells lol
[0:47:54] play_x_play: you can‚Äôt charge people for something that happened prior to a law going into effect

[0:48:06] StreamElements: Watch my latest video: Cornwood Goes "Undercover" - https://youtube.com/watch?v=Y15LQQdKfY0
[0:48:08] Vexamas: It's not double jeopardy, just retroactively enforcing a law, which is a huge no no and even the thought of it is 'powerful' and weird
[0:48:10] destinygun: @EsfandTV Look at firearm charges

[0:48:19] Connorbrow: @RnG_Qwik Yeah, exactly!
[0:48:20] BlakeChaos: having the parts should charge for manufacturing
[0:48:21] sammelweis: @RnG_Qwik same situation = same crime
[0:48:22] SewSt00pid: Anyone in chat know what time SoD is released?
[0:48:23] eaglezFly: if you wanted to wait for it to become illegal wait 30 days to press charges
[0:48:25] TheUglyOne: @play_x_play You can let them know the law has changed and the items they have are no longer ok to have.
[0:48:28] miketwng: a new precedent needs to be pushed

[0:48:39] MothyNZ: ISnt it still possession of stolen goods?
[0:48:49] purplegion: You'd need the bench with blueprints in it which will be hard
[0:48:52] charybdes: and the weapons workbench
[0:48:52] Freddiepines: Most of the original laws in 4.0 are paper tigers
[0:48:56] YakOnFire: just action it once its legal going back is weird
[0:48:56] Connorbrow: @BlakeChaos If you don't formualte things correctly then nothing will stick in court
[0:48:58] Entropystachio: is there a need for an "intent to manufacture" disambiguation

[0:49:13] EnochBlanche: is that pistachio?
[0:49:13] THE_GIGACHAD_OF_TWITCH: @khrow any charge with a red banner over it is a HUT/9's charge, yes. Otherwise known as a capital offense
[0:49:14] miketwng: @purplegion psst the crims have it
[0:49:14] play_x_play: @theuglyone all the crim has to say is oh I don‚Äôt have those anymore

[0:49:22] BelllGoR: KEKW
[0:49:27] quaylewastaken: It's stolen property how you gonna give them back
[0:49:28] Naphtax: would possession of a gun not for sale in ammunation be enough to assume weapons manufacturing?
[0:49:37] DrWetbone: double jeopardy prevents an accused person from being tried again on the same (or similar) charges following an acquittal or conviction
[0:49:40] BlakeChaos: @Connorbrow Guy was coming from a weapons crate robbery, has weapons parts on him that aren't available anywhere else in the city.. how is that hard to formulate?
[0:49:45] eaglezFly: no taurus on seminole NODDERS
[0:49:46] ayylmaopp: Clueless surely the PD can read
[0:49:48] sammelweis: @Doqx42 it wont change after the fact - he got charged when it was the law. look at marijuana IRL - people arent just being released

[2:58:15] guilt_: Of course that's your contention. You're a first year grad student. You just finished some Marxian historian, Pete Garrison prob'ly, and so naturally that's what you believe until next month when you get to James Lemon and get convinced that Virginia and Pennsylvania were strongly entrepreneurial and capitalist back in 1740. That'll last until sometime in your second year, then you'll be in here regurgitating Gordon Wood about the Pre-revolutionary utopia.

[4:11:32] Mac_Parts: @EsfandTV When my Dad was Chief of Police his primary curser was an SUV. That was the one he brought home with him every day. The reason he had that though was because he was not going to a seen or getting in chases. It to allow he to show up somewhere and show his presents. The Portal Officers were using high end sedans. Ask Andrews he might have the same prospective.

[4:42:16] YUPImMcLovin: when can I be a cop
[4:42:22] PsychoJoker: @DatDudeJakeC because ssaab doesnt wanna hire a bunch of old pd officers so they are forced to make new characters. Like TJ Mack is now MacMahon etc
[4:42:22] greyjulian: @xen_crypt they just want new people and new characters - old cops help to fill in the training ranks needed for newbies

[4:42:57] TheKingOfWit: Ssaab has said OOC he wants new characters and doesn't want to rehire all the same character, not people but characters
[4:43:01] SmugPls: The goal of 4.0 was to try and push all new characters, omly the PD is being held to that though.
[4:43:03] BLazOR_Prime: He didnt read the announcement
[4:43:16] Thraxton1: new storylines is nice

[4:45:00] BLazOR_Prime: report 1804, not the announcement
[4:45:06] FilzG: @MagicTheHydrated they are, but what people are saying is that they continued history from 3.0 while the PD didn't. So PD is behind as hell not as organized as crims
[4:45:09] itWyrm: @SmugPls thats Classic Ramee
[4:45:18] BLazOR_Prime: you gotta do it in the Shift 2 registery
[4:45:24] greyjulian: @magicthehydrated yes, it was more hyperbole about PD being held to a wildly different standard having them be even more behind the curve
[4:45:37] EmDuBB13: @SmugPls is he really?!? ya kinda sucks but i could see it being miserable at times

[7:21:51] fishnchips333: prio doesnt fix a dead character story lol but it helps
[7:21:52] bertacharm: thats 9
[7:21:53] FelipeLLs: @FelipeLLs god damn it stop esfandPains
[7:21:54] Alphawins: cornwood looks like he is the umbrella
[7:21:54] AddyAdam: that was rough to watch. They dont bring that kind of energy to Ruth, just officers like Denzel and Johnson.
[7:21:55] ImStuckInATreeDud: back 10-8 mhm
[7:21:56] Mojorsin: @fkingjagaloon They did said cuz he lie. But he didint lie, was a shitshow to be honest.
[7:21:57] Motokid600: @GlitchyGunZ - He didnt defend himself at all

[7:22:08] slomojosh: does Cornwood know yet?
[7:22:08] TheXenoNox: OOC - general question to understand the Johnson issue. Slacks omits details in his reports as well no? i.e leaving statements out of reports? is that not the same thing or is that different?
[7:22:09] ShultzFPS: LULW Û†ÄÄ
[7:22:10] tinywulf: are those roaches?>

[7:22:11] KenKardashian: Stare
[7:22:12] Firehead94: @GlitchyGunZ long story short, he got into a fist fight with mr k while on duty. mr k provoked it but johnson took the bait and then tried to defend his actions as in the right
[7:22:12] thegummibearmassacre: modCheck
[7:22:18] cuspeli: cornbrella
[7:22:21] StormiNyan: a hwhile 2TONNING
[7:22:22] CowWizardMoneyGang: @TheXenoNox cornwood does not know why do you come here to ask?
[7:22:24] Motokid600: @infintitedream - "fired"
[7:22:24] cheebah710: cohhNODDERS cohhNODDERS cohhNODDERS

[7:22:41] Auhreliam: @a2th3vi Yes
[7:22:45] crunchwastaken: @GlitchyGunZ unlucky
[7:22:48] thatguydancingintheclub: its all good RP though boys and girls
[7:22:54] a2th3vi: @a2th3vi very Pog
[7:22:56] ArdentCause: @TheXenoNox I think the difference is the demeanor of an officer - they have made a point of being respectful etc
[7:22:59] GlitchyGunZ: @firehead94 long story short I was watching it live. K hit him first and he wasn‚Äôt in the wrong. You fucking dweebs are unbearable
[7:22:59] lawlkat: chat. does anyone know what happened with johnson?
[7:23:04] fishnchips333: @CowWizardMoneyGang ugh fyi ooc means out of character. so esfand not cornwood
[7:23:09] GlitchyGunZ: crazy
[7:23:11] MetalNbonez: double barrel that cocks huh LOOOL
[7:23:13] humanhere2: so many bugs on the ground....
[7:23:16] smokeweedeverydad: Essaying in chat Pog
[7:23:17] Motokid600: Johnson was punched, enraged. Started stripping for a fight stating "im loosing my job" He then lied on that statement.
[7:23:17] spicyville: if he he creates another PD character he would be let back in in a heartbeat
[7:23:18] CowWizardMoneyGang: @CowWizardMoneyGang why would esfand know either? OOC means literally nothing in a chat message.
[7:23:30] Caeros: @Firehead94 AND there were mismatching statements, but Slacks just says "lies" over and over. Like the Denzel situation
[7:23:30] Smoogol: arnoldHalt chat
[7:23:31] Verion: @Firehead94 in the report/announcement from Slacks it says that Johnson lied in a report which is the reason for being fired
[7:23:31] gangstarofgamez: But he did
[7:23:33] khrow: xqcSmug
[7:23:38] ilmarcusil: @hereforff9 think there's 2 Johnsons in the PD
[7:23:39] Clodhoppr: chill chat
[7:23:39] T_Bricko: its gotta be wild i feel like
[7:23:40] le_bingus_: when he says 'its been 6years' is that literally?
[7:23:40] Lovin_Machine: chat let him find out in RP
[7:23:40] RietArtwork: or they want it for RP
[7:23:42] GD_Rep: slacks hired him too, slacks tried hard to keep him
[7:23:43] EPiQ: also...getting fired on the spot...is RP
[7:23:44] fraudiola9: He can be hires on another character right away chat
[7:23:46] RobialT: It was weird cause apparently he used something he said in VOD but not char when questioning him?
[7:23:46] StormiNyan: Hmmge we shall know soon tm
[7:23:47] a2th3vi: slacks would get every side of the situation too
[7:23:47] Lord__Gen: He got in a fist fight with Mr. K
[7:23:49] CrystalDimension: @EsfandTV well he's suspended so he's not fired yet
[7:23:49] ManySadPandas: they gave him like 7 DAPs last weekend
[7:23:50] gangstarofgamez: Johnson didn't lie tho
[7:23:50] CodeForTea: sketchy firing in my opinion
[7:23:50] GD_Rep: slacks hired him too, slacks tried hard to keep him @EsfandTV
[7:23:52] taraannee: i didnt know what happened, and when i watched that clip of the og situation, it was even worse than ppl said, it was 100% deserved
[7:23:53] Switchblade142: Apparently misremembering or mishearing = lying I guess
[7:23:55] spicyville: he gave him prio
[7:23:55] Teckinn: he said he could make another cop
[7:23:55] ethanmn1280: ssab gave him prio
[7:23:55] GlitchyGunZ: you talking about the same guy who didn‚Äôt understand your take on treating officers all differently based on their actions? @esfandtv
[7:23:56] the_real_jfk: it was pretty rough
[7:23:56] ArdentCause: yeah 100%
[7:23:56] MexiBrent: her told him he couold make another cop
[7:23:57] Motokid600: @GlitchyGunZ - Police dont start street fights. Johnson backed off, PREPARED for a fight. Instead of going for an arrest.
[7:23:57] NasrulAshr: Is firing the same as perma? , need the player aproval?
[7:23:58] icecubedude_: so many roaches by the trash can
[7:23:58] boozncruise: he already told him to make a new cop charaacter lmaoo

[7:24:06] sourdoughcookies: fired in february? Sadge
[7:24:07] djSimSi: @EsfandTV Saab gave him Prio
[7:24:07] ArdentCause: ssaab took it rough too
[7:24:08] Firehead94: @TheXenoNox its a bit different as its seen as more malicious by the capt/snr's to defend his job.
[7:24:08] yogaisdank: leave them hanging how @EsfandTV
[7:24:08] Jessimi: Saabb helped bump his prio after.
[7:24:09] sharrkuu: he gave him prop and said he can use another cop

[7:24:12] Jrey000: Chat tldr what did he do?
[7:24:12] Motokid600: No attempt at an arrest was made
[7:24:16] tellos0: Saab did him good, no worries about that ;)
[7:24:16] Smoogol: arnoldHalt
[7:24:17] TheMah1337: its fine he will make some good rp out of this, apparently they gave him prio
[7:24:17] Connorbrow: He definitely didn't outright lie though, he lied by omittion at best, and at worst it was a heated situation and he just forgot details
[7:24:18] icephrogg: if he lied and thats why he was fired i think sonya should be fired to
[7:24:19] Brandonhipster: Saab gave him prio also chat
[7:24:21] supaiiii: yea he got prio with the firing

[7:24:26] mad0monk: money on Johnson joining CG and getting revenge
[7:24:26] hoopyfrood12: surprised esfand isnt playing sod
[7:24:28] Lord__Gen: Saab gave him a chance, but he double downed on lying about the situation to cover his ass.
[7:24:28] PandaNomsBamboo: bad integrity gotta be honest
[7:24:28] Daehv: who got fired?
[7:24:29] MistaMista: i gave him prio

[7:24:39] viperz152: no I have him prio
[7:24:41] Nerdversity: @EsfandTV they also told him in message, that he can recreate another cop and apply to the PD and they would let him
[7:24:41] the_real_jfk: he would have been fine if he didnt try to fight it and double down
[7:24:42] Gachiguru: He didnt lie LULE
[7:24:43] bertacharm: saab said he told him he could make another i think i heard him say
[7:24:43] RobialT: He didnt give all the details in his report but the other officers acvtually lied in their reports TBH
[7:24:43] LamePuf: just too much hoppers in slacs chat making him angry Sadge
[7:24:44] tinywulf: still dont like the way this pd is run too uptight still oh well
[7:24:44] frickjerm: he gave him multiple chances to not get fired
[7:24:46] gimmedacheekz: I missed out who got fired
[7:24:46] Motokid600: The other officers were in the wrong too. They too made no attempt at an arrest and gave Johnson ample time to go back in for a fight.
[7:24:47] M__Wolfe: What happened chat?
[7:24:47] BattleAlpaca: Yeah he didn't explicitly lie but omitted details but didn't think he did because he would have added more if he thought he needed too, just bad roll of dice
[7:24:49] Raja_Banhammer: HUH
[7:24:49] GlitchyGunZ: @motokid600 just stop replying to me you‚Äôre braindead I get it
[7:24:50] fishnchips333: i gave him prio too
[7:24:50] Switchblade142: @Lord__Gen But misremembering/mishearing is not the same thing as lying.

[8:04:20] GYNECHIATRIST: Hmm
[8:04:20] Switchblade142: @RsMadeMePhat Johnson, the loud cop. He misremembered some situations and misheard somethings and they counted that as a lie.
[8:04:21] Nerdversity: agree you right

[8:04:29] Ibiffo: yeah awesome rp to be honest. The character just needs to not omit details when providing a statement
[8:04:30] jacksmithcje: it just reminds me of the two cops saying cornwood waved a gun when civs said he didn‚Äôt yet they also were on duty and didn‚Äôt stop the lady on stage
[8:04:31] 1FusterCluck1: @fulladelphia he said it was in self defense. it wasn‚Äôt

[8:04:38] d4rk3nergy: wait who fired?
[8:04:39] dudemanbroo: prolly because the mega crims in the city were hunting him lmao
