[2:49:29] fur3x: Theres a texture budget limit u can increase might be that
[2:50:05] illifis: Texture budget might be set a bit too high. Not sure though
[2:50:13] OhHeyRad: I had to decrease my texture budget the other day to make things less framey
[2:50:21] fur3x: hmm yeah might have to lower it if ure stuck with 8gb vram
[2:50:30] illifis: It doesnt need to be all the way AFAIK
[2:50:38] GordoUK: like 70% i think
[2:50:41] fur3x: I remember getting those stutters when my gpu was running out of VRAM

[2:57:36] BlightSpeaker26: Do you have an AMD CPU?
[2:57:40] OhHeyRad: that's what makes me suspect the extended texture budget. Like the VRam is full but its still trying to load stuff
[2:57:47] DEAD_P1XL: AMD or NVidia GPU?
[2:58:03] Khaza_: hmm
[2:58:06] fur3x: do u have MSI AFterburner or something that shows u how much VRAM is being used?

[3:20:20] Corvollo: my 3080 has been crashing occasionally. Setting the extended texture budget to full and taking quality down to medium helped quite a bit. I'm trying some other recommendation but finding the "sweet spot" has been a pain.

[3:48:20] DEAD_P1XL: That's what I thought
[3:48:49] DEAD_P1XL: Those loitering munition drones are pretty scary
[3:49:04] Shayeta: How is the russian EW? Are they still just jamming everything or did they start to adapt to selective jamming?

[3:49:38] werpeu: What would you say the largest misconception about the war people have?
[3:50:04] Corvollo: EW was falling off for a bit there, Drone revived it's need in a HUGE way -- I did SIGINT
[3:50:36] Nightbot: Join us on Discord! We have cat pictures, memes, and a bunch of really cool supportive people. https://discord.gg/cathfawr
[3:50:38] SteelyDan68: 30 years ago, FLIR tech was astronomical. Today, it's in your phone.
[3:52:00] Corvollo: Russia had a GIGA brain drain.
[3:52:23] Corvollo: That's a BIG issue with the media. They show Kyiv in relative peace and say "Nothing going on in ukraine" or "Ukraine is blowing the aid on {{Not the war}}" like what do you expect people not on the front to do? Shelter in place and wait to die?
[3:52:44] StepPogger: you see it with you too, "why are you on twitter"

[3:53:16] Corvollo: It becomes the Status quo, as morbid as that is.
[3:53:40] Khaza_: Wow, people having internet access in 2024?
[3:54:16] mugcostanza: cath4Math
[3:54:52] DEAD_P1XL: Ooh that sounds awesome
[3:55:00] Corvollo: Way too attached to the "War is hell" mentality. War is hell while bullets are flying but like you said, that's maybe 3% of the time in modern/guerilla/skirmish warfare? 3% itself is almost an overestimate in my opinion.
[3:55:01] GerritS1995: Also really expensive probably?
[3:55:06] GerritS1995: Yeh LUL
[3:55:25] Sablotron: think there's a smartereveryday video about how those work.
[3:55:47] DEAD_P1XL: I think it was a recent veritassium vid that covered light amplification night vision
[3:55:51] Shayeta: Yea, that was also kind of a thing here in Croatia during the 90s. Here where I grew up in the west of the country life went on, as it did in the east of the country where there was fighting. Humans form anywhere are more capable to adapt to hard situations than they think
[3:56:04] michael_paul__: Strange that termal optics goes by volunteers to soldiers and not by gov issued exuipment
[3:56:10] Corvollo: True, I'm much more Middle-Eastern fighting a un-uniformed enemy experienced than you who is actually in two nation war.

[4:27:04] MooseSyndrome: bet the clutch smells burnt a lil bit
[4:27:17] raeken88: it might be the courthouse, the building is crazy
[4:27:22] Hobbitbot: Murphy was having issues that looked similar, I'm not sure if it's actually the same issue your having because his were pretty much everywhere. But it had something to do with one of the resolution settings I think lowering one of them seemed to help.
[4:27:31] RYJarnovk: Might have to relog before you see it
[4:28:09] illifis: @RYJarnovk Not for this one. There is a tiny meta to this.

[4:34:51] Corvollo: The interesting trade off -- The visual mod is so intensive that you have to downscale it until it looks worse that vanilla --
[4:34:59] Corvollo: than*
[4:35:33] Khaza_: Vanilla looks great for a 10 year old game
[4:36:11] GamesBeTripping: yeah it does...
[4:36:13] TabletopMinions: The trees look odd.
[4:36:13] Ogichihollow: yeah my 1080 isnt happy with the current server lol but i do need to update that card
[4:36:31] KillaKwik: without a god tier pc…
[4:36:35] Ruzmuz: yeah it looks so bad when you have to use settings this low
[4:36:40] raeken88: nve in general causes stuttering
[4:36:55] KillaKwik: flomcSk flomcRr flomcRt
[4:36:59] Corvollo: too much focus on palette, not enough on texture optimization. The colors are a lot more vibrant imo and that's about it.
[4:37:36] raeken88: cath4Pls
[4:37:36] Corvollo: The Jhook to hide behind the median was pretty slick
[4:37:56] Deerboy2080: omg your back
[4:37:56] Corvollo: next slide please!
[4:38:39] Muddr: probably the apartments
[4:38:47] Corvollo: Have you ever just sat close to the apartments. Whenever someone opens a damn door you get a microstutter while their room renders into the outside world.
[4:38:52] raeken88: how did kylie fix hers @Corvollo
[4:39:14] Corvollo: @raeken88 I think she has a dual pc set up, and a giga pc of hell to run the game. Taking as much load off the CPU as humanly possible.
[4:39:33] mugcostanza: cath4WICKED
[4:40:00] Corvollo: and you're still having these issues? Goddamn
[4:40:05] MrGoodkatGaming: kariFINE
[4:40:30] BladedBuzzer: i think the issue kylie was having at the apartments was the server and was a dev fix
[4:40:50] Hobbitbot: I think Murphy fixed a similar looking issue by adjusting one of the resolution settings. It wasn't the overall resolution of the entire game, but there was another resolution in settings that he lowered that seemed to help the issue at least, if it's the same issue.
[4:40:54] KillaKwik: server has issues, regardless of personal setup…
[4:41:16] raeken88: @Corvollo she uses a different pack made by tobii
[4:41:55] Hobbitbot: that sucks
[4:42:11] Khaza_: hmmm
[4:42:19] LiamJS_: snow had issues while tow trucking where it would stutter he relogged and that fixed it
[4:42:23] Impulse_9: Local pc stutters? (not looking to deep dive on it on stream)
[4:42:32] bluepike: Holy shit, hey Cath! Good to see you again.
[4:42:42] Scab_: VRAM?
[4:42:47] illifis: Makes it sound like there is some simple setting that is just messed up
[4:43:13] SweetWheat_: Some others were having similar issues and it ended but being GPU drivers needing to be updated
[4:43:17] raeken88: i would ask kylie or ask tobii for the pack he made @CathFawr
[4:43:30] Khaza_: @SweetWheat_ yeah, drivers might help
[4:43:35] FreefireHS: maybe it stops when u are done downloading new shit..... just need to drive around to pick them up?
[4:43:35] bluepike: Resizable BAR enabled in BIOs along with the 4G setting?
[4:44:14] Wafawel: lol
[4:44:27] Wafawel: Gay?
[4:44:27] Nightbot: Gay?
[4:44:53] Khaza_: Prayge it's a bit better after driver updates
[4:44:57] Ogichihollow: cath if you do find out what it its let me know i get similar stutters
[4:46:06] JibJibFlutterhous: iiiiHug y'all cutes best have a wonderful day, ok?
