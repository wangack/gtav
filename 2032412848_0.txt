[6:35:56] cakedupdadjeans: @sgt_rubberducky9 not surprised with how much of a bottleneck it is. I hope they add in another way to get mats.
[6:35:57] Fugeki: materials rule the economy everyone is trying to establish themselves in sani since it’s the main material source
[6:36:45] cakedupdadjeans: Maybe if they let tow drivers break down vehicles or something
[6:36:58] sgt_rubberducky9: 🫠 I should sleep but fck.... im not tired at all
[6:37:31] Fugeki: I like it that sani is the only way to get mats but I also agree that if materials are split it should be so that every job gets some sort of resource that they need to sell
[6:37:37] LavaPhoenixT: @Fugeki Oh yeah, I forgot I was given pills but I can't take pills whatsoever. I have since changed my diet and lifestyle since it was mostly attributed to my weight and sleep. That's just me. I hope it gets better for you.
[6:38:10] cakedupdadjeans: Ruthless
[6:38:33] Fugeki: @lavaphoenixt yeah I only got acid reflux after u got Covid it sucks but I also changed my eating habits sucks that I have to avoid so many foods though
