[5:06:50] dudeenoch: iirc i didnt see X or Dundee shoot till after the dundee sacrifice
[5:06:50] snurphles: @TheDarkRedbird Didn't cops shoot first at tires, and then crims shot?
[5:06:51] Kappsule: good call for baas to have air 1 go fuel
[5:06:59] h0neybadgerz: @dudeenoch Cop SOPS gives the ability to shoot the tires of bikes when they aren't mobile and a cop called out that a gun was pointed at them
[5:07:07] Kyndagh: Baas's refuel call was amazing
[5:07:30] Ownager: Does someone know why they usually use Crown Vics instead of other models?
[5:07:37] 0xygenhomie: like if bayo directed the back cars to parallel, they wouldve done it. but they wouldnt think to do it on theirown
[5:07:45] dudeenoch: honnestly that  double comet bit had me a bit confused in the momment and thats when the shots started
[5:07:49] kuro_xvi: @Ownager no cops have the money to buy it + other models are still being worked on
[5:07:54] TheDarkRedbird: @snurphles They said they could start shooting the tires if they were a standstill, but Idk if they actually did from Air 1's POV though
[5:07:57] UsicMusic: @Ownager the crown vic is the only custom car for PD right now but more models are in the works
[5:08:01] raydryak: Crown vics just an iconic police symbol tbh

[5:08:07] leightones: @kuro_xvi well, seems peaceful, unless mods have fast fingers
