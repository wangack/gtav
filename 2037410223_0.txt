[3:11:01] yellowhammer26: no shot they would be petty right?
[3:11:01] RogueBear: i think when you were taken in they specifically said you were being charged with "Felony Possesion with intent to Distribute" but nothing was finalized because of the raid

[3:12:51] lilsapphirepanda: ezz sxnchez
[3:12:58] Chanceemergency: It's not a raid if you know about it
[3:13:13] DanteEverlight: it’s an investigative hold so they in theory can still charge and send you up because it’s really only supposed to be used if they can’t hit charges yet due to warrants. however you should have been told once they got the warrant and searched your property since they have to provide you with a raid receipt
[3:13:21] lilsapphirepanda: essaying oh my

[3:15:06] neptune19zuma87wolf: The 24 hour hold is for investigation purposes
[3:15:07] boggrt: They havent been raided yet, right? You have to be present if they want to raid ? (Coz your appartment despawns )
[3:15:14] jeekstapose: time to lawyer up
[3:15:15] blahblahem: that's how it works irl lmao
[3:15:17] Waxcorefish: @Chanceemergency OK, then I know

[3:15:55] antosbla: i think your supposed to go to the pd after ur out
[3:16:00] DanteEverlight: yupp. they can request a continuance if a judge never responded but that’s been rare

[3:17:30] blahblahem: @drbear__ think it's the same irl where you can only hold someone without charges for 24 hours but they can be charged after and kept under hold again
[3:17:35] alphaKenDoit: Is that frynaut?
[3:17:43] CMYKHalftone: I miss Kratos
[3:17:51] ingridktravels: Yes it is frynaut

[3:18:29] boggrt: @Phoenix_Rising25 but they have to charge him within that 24 hours i think (?) Not sure
[3:18:39] Phoenix_Rising25: hmmMeeting
[3:18:48] tom_artist: if they don't find anything in 24rs you walk free, pending new evidence, if they get new evidence they can hold or charge again. if theres nothing new there should be no charges.
[3:18:49] Corvis_glyph: MrDestructoid voice sounded like avtuber
[3:18:52] drbear__: @blahblahem I see. So the hold is only like giving the PD time to gather more evidence?

[5:12:36] Fossabot: the PMBU, or the professional make believe union is union consisting of GTA RP streamers under 1000 viewers. The union dictates that streamers over 1000 viewers shall shout out the smaller roleplayer 5 times, as well as gift 100 subs to the streamer in order for them to be interacted with. Lastly, they will need to raid you at the end of stream.This applies to ever time that the smaller streamer is interacted with. Contact @KristoferYee to join the union.

The union dictates that streamers over 1000 viewers shall shout out the smaller roleplayer 5 times, as well as gift 100 subs to the streamer in order for them to be interacted with. Lastly, they will need to raid you at the end of stream.This applies to ever time that the smaller streamer is interacted with. Contact @KristoferYee to join the union.

[5:41:13] mcDeRose: jay would snitch and get dundee to go to war if he needs it om
[5:41:14] silverarrows47: a lot*
[5:41:17] AgentOrange666_: Make it a one time snitch not a long time as he wants
[5:41:18] Phoenix_Rising25: Roll for snitching with advantage DC 14
[5:41:21] sanzonw: Don't snitch they have the book anyways
[5:41:22] MayaisAqt: jay loses everything
[5:41:22] kitoisblooming: wait are we talking about jason and raia? they wouldn't clap back i think
[5:41:27] GoldGuardianX: Hell cops treated Jay with more respect than the groups he was in
[5:41:33] chinbinchin: i mean JJ was there as you were getting dragged across G6 Shrug
[5:41:33] mcDeRose: @kitoisblooming no this is something else
[5:41:33] doritoes1234: Do it. It makes sense in RP
[5:41:34] LittleTwurtle: mhm 󠀀
[5:41:37] Frank_282: I think not only KC, but other crims as well
[5:41:43] kitoisblooming: oh
[5:41:43] maelroth: I haven't heard of kaneshiro
[5:41:46] TEKYTECH: They didnt care sbout jay so oh well
[5:41:50] ShadowDeathStrike: But it's good for RP though
[5:41:51] sandeep_bs: I would want Jay to be around nodd
[5:41:51] mcDeRose: roll for it
[5:41:52] MsTeamKK: fuckem they kicked Jay out. but also couldn’t you feed him fake info?
[5:41:53] boggrt: you already kinda snitched with the book, they are going to find out neways as pd will act on it somehow
[5:41:54] Phoenix_Rising25: Cheer100 roll for it?
[5:41:54] Fossabot: Phoenix_Rising25 just cheered 100 bits! HYPERS
[5:41:55] owl______________________: I think it's worth the risk
[5:41:55] viruszwerg125: how long would you serve
[5:41:55] jeerlang: OOC fallout
[5:41:57] mcDeRose: roll a d 20
[5:41:58] Zoeper: Jay next cop enrolled
[5:41:58] silverarrows47: @kitoisblooming This is WAY bigger than Civ Gang
[5:41:59] MayaisAqt: I see your point Kris
[5:42:00] jerabet: @Frank_282 I mean yeah, once your character is labeled a snitch it's usually done in the criminal world.
[5:42:02] Stargazeio: Shrug jay lost everything already but its up to u
[5:42:02] sxnchez: yawN
[5:42:03] Vivaciousx3: ask for assurance your name wont come up?
[5:42:03] btc718: rolll
[5:42:03] jojoppa: ariaHmm
[5:42:03] MadSertep: make a poll ?
[5:42:06] JohnieP: Is there a way to give them enough info without implicating Jay as the snitch?
[5:42:08] maximusormous: FOR THE CHARACTER riott
[5:42:08] Linds_Brohan: Kinda sucks that you can't go with the pure RP choice
[5:42:09] AresUchiha: ask the magic conch
[5:42:10] Frogsgoboo: d20
[5:42:11] FreedomSock: I don't think the rp is worth the hate tbh
[5:42:12] AFFABLE__: they will payoff a cop or judge and find out and jay will get ocean dumped
[5:42:14] slashoverzone: DO IT, do it, Do it, dO iT,
[5:42:15] chewienutz: magic conch?
[5:42:15] neybersaber: shouldn't Jay also think about future group?
[5:42:17] chinbinchin: PauseCat
[5:42:17] HotCocoaGamer: I can guarantee the only ones who will be weird with it all is viewers.
[5:42:18] rien_d: would jay care about getting the rep of being a snitch throughout the city?
[5:42:19] Corvis_glyph: if Kris was huge streamer he could maybe do it

[5:42:22] MisterChowmein: take the charge, say the book is fiction
[5:42:22] MrLebowski_: whos gang is that?
[5:42:23] renimation: we need the spice
[5:42:23] cen0wy: its hard man, when the RP tied with the OOC feeling
[5:42:24] ingenus: I mean at the end of the day there's a point to nopixel and it's not streamer politics tbh
[5:42:24] Harkzie: snitching on pure crim mechanics is what is bad. Being a ci for rp reasons shouldn't be an issue but sadly reality isn't as easy :(
[5:42:24] Realzman: I'm going to be honest in a perfect world, jay does it and has great spicy RP. But people "Finding out" or other things that may happen along with it ooc might be alot
[5:42:27] btc718: do it
[5:42:27] CMYKHalftone: Curious if Jay has a better shot being a cop after this?
[5:42:28] RID__O1: keep yourself safe
[5:42:29] ShadowDeathStrike: Smol Pp
[5:42:29] justyxgaming: Tbf you said the other night you were kind of done with Jay and how hard other ppl fuck him over. Moght as well go out with a blaze if anytjing
[5:42:30] chinbinchin: OOOO OHSHIT
[5:42:30] MsTeamKK: can’t you feed him fake into? @kristoferyee
[5:42:30] klaunns: the moment Jay walk away free, they would figure out Jay snitched
[5:42:32] Zarniwooper: He probably would
[5:42:32] oAesthetic_: who is he snitching on?
[5:42:35] TheMarfl: Fair enough Nick only did it because he's huge on his own
[5:42:35] Phoenix_Rising25: is there any RP reason Jay wouldn't?
[5:42:36] L7_Imagin: @KristoferYee ASK THE MAGIC CONCH
[5:42:36] mcDeRose: plus people already hate you on the subreddit om
[5:42:38] Sunhwa: will it burn jay for the future? being known as a snitch if found out?
[5:42:38] maximusormous: rolling for it does clear k nd on what u want
[5:42:38] chinbinchin: ohShit ITS GONNA GO DOWN ohShit ITS GONNA GO DOWN ohShit ITS GONNA GO DOWN
[5:42:40] EyeScraem: dumb question would you ever consider permaing jay off this?
[5:42:40] rotten02: snitch time FRICK them
[5:42:41] rubberdebugger: sucks that ooc gets in the way of rp so often
[5:42:41] sandeep_bs: Jay would but kris doesn't want to nodd
[5:42:41] lankyCRAIG: PausersHype well the cops have the book and depending on you say is what on top is the only thing people can be mad at kwis
[5:42:41] drbear__: yee7 yee7

[5:42:45] MayaisAqt: @realzman I agree Zach
[5:42:45] bbcherry24: I think snitch RP for revenge is interesting what isn't interesting is just snitching for money
[5:42:46] XXMu93nXX: i feel like they are going to retaliate IC whether you do or don't, b/c they are gonna assume you did
[5:42:47] TEKYTECH: But get the deal in writing
[5:42:48] Frank_282: No more Jay crim o7
[5:42:51] 5ynchr0nize: Are you going to wake up Jay to face the consequences?
[5:42:54] Lucsvm: no
[5:42:54] rien_d: @MrLebowski_ mary mushkin
[5:42:55] MisterChowmein: say the book is fake info
[5:42:56] AFFABLE__: Jay has no reason not to and all the reasons to do it.
[5:42:57] indigodream_: it’s better to do it now that it’s hard to get guns

[6:07:33] Fossabot: the PMBU, or the professional make believe union is union consisting of GTA RP streamers under 1000 viewers. The union dictates that streamers over 1000 viewers shall shout out the smaller roleplayer 5 times, as well as gift 100 subs to the streamer in order for them to be interacted with. Lastly, they will need to raid you at the end of stream.This applies to ever time that the smaller streamer is interacted with. Contact @KristoferYee to join the union.

[6:26:41] DanteEverlight: the only bad scenario I can see come from the interrogation is if PD wanted a CI on KC but then you have to tell them you got kicked out and then they go back and still charge you the felony and Jay gets little to nothing out of it

[6:30:50] Fossabot: Metagaming is providing a streamer with relayed information that was learned outside of the immediate stream and is against the rules of the NoPixel server. This includes telling where other characters are and what they have done or are doing. tiny.cc/metagaming
[6:30:52] DanteEverlight: Kris have you seen the steam trailer for palworld? it’s a good watch
[6:30:58] lankyCRAIG: @justyxgaming like two hours

[6:31:06] Chanceemergency: @mcderose I know who Zach Martin is lol
[6:31:07] dontbeshellfish: the jail time is not the issue
[6:31:11] mcDeRose: yep take the felony and play ka chao om
[6:31:12] silverarrows47: I wonder how Jay expects to get back inside KC as an informant
[6:31:24] maelroth: so they gonna do you 24 hours then another 2 hmm
[6:31:26] xxwolfie9xx: @mcDeRose already time served
[6:31:32] SpartanPikmin: would jail time count right now? meaning would your hold here be ticking that time?
[6:31:32] sandeep_bs: Kris wouldn't Jay get another felony anyways tho if he dodges this one Hmm
[6:31:37] AnArousedHippo: so 150 months sentence is worst then a 24 hour hold thats sick
[6:31:39] mcDeRose: @Chanceemergency well i saw him this last weekend. the owner is ready to fire everyone
[6:31:56] Alsefixx: What kind of character is Jay?
[6:31:58] AnArousedHippo: is not as bad *

The union dictates that streamers over 1000 viewers shall shout out the smaller roleplayer 5 times, as well as gift 100 subs to the streamer in order for them to be interacted with. Lastly, they will need to raid you at the end of stream.This applies to ever time that the smaller streamer is interacted with. Contact @KristoferYee to join the union.

[15:13:10] bl0ved: long jump
[15:13:15] kevinth3panda: long jump
[15:13:19] sleepysuzu: how many sports would you win if you had an air dash?
[15:13:32] ingenus: imagine mfs pole vaulting and just jumping again after boosting as high as they can
[15:13:37] kevinth3panda: volleyball would be helpful
[15:13:40] sir_somelongname: Double jump. Jump of a plane and at the last second hit the double jump ez stunt money
[15:13:41] Stargazeio: pole vault, long jump, maybe hurdles Nerd
[15:13:41] Mars_nights: anything that needs speed
[15:13:41] ser_loony: you would probably be the best athlete in 50% of all sports
[15:13:43] Chanceemergency: @yammers8 haha yeah. I know it gets shit on but I love SAO especially the last couple seasons
[15:13:49] bl0ved: i still think airdash has more utility
[15:13:50] yammers8: yeah but what if it’s double your current jump? how much would that actually be
[15:13:50] ingenus: stealing RP from chat -1
[15:13:59] tripleduck: if you take air dash, you'll dash smack into a wall, ICU time. if you take double jump, you break your legs landing, ICU time. both suck ass
[15:14:00] sleepysuzu: OMEGADANCE
[15:14:14] bl0ved: no fox metal legs
[15:14:21] Stargazeio: Hmm is fall damage nullified or not

[15:14:52] Hsuperman18: short king yee7
[15:14:55] CMYKHalftone: How they never know... Can't they see you?
[15:14:58] Stargazeio: volleyball would be good with a double jump
[15:14:59] Crystalcoconut1: Hmm it depends if the air dash resets fall damage
[15:15:05] baggjie: 10cm+10cm jump....
[15:15:06] sleepysuzu: Fall damage kicks in at heights about 1.17x your max vertical double jump
[15:15:18] yammers8: @chanceemergency lol yeah I respect it. SAO season 1 and 2 on Netflix made me go down the rabbit hole of becoming a true weeb. so it has a special place in my heart

[15:15:41] chinbinchin: i forgot how good BF1 was
[15:15:43] GoldGuardianX: In basketball, double jump means if you have a short jump you can dunk. Air dash would mean if you have a good jump you can dunk from 3 point line
[15:15:44] sleepysuzu: i meant to put 1.75 but i'm high
[15:15:55] chinbinchin: oh my lord where did battlefied go wrong

[15:41:03] yammers8: season 3 of shield hero is partially redeeming
[15:41:03] Syntai_dev: Frieren is like the season 2 of vinland saga. It's more about personal growth. Almost no action.

[15:41:10] claerwinter: After the turtle fight it gets better on season 2

[15:43:06] Syntai_dev: @KristoferYee Most annoying anime trope?
[15:43:12] bigjohnbriggs: JJK though, I teared up towards end of second season it was just that well done

[17:03:42] ShadowDeathStrike: Did getting a lawyer f things over with what the cops wanted to do?
[17:03:43] chaosgeek1: I mean, boring or not (and I don't think it's boring, just chill) grinding to a certain extent is neccesary to have the money to do the more eventful stuff
[17:03:47] muffinplaysgames: Is it bad of me that I wanna see this truck ram a cop car? @KristoferYee
[17:03:47] batexcali: house security is improving some

[17:04:26] s13epy: It's Yeagers cousin
[17:04:27] Chanceemergency: @alaineman giving up information about the Clan Jay was in before
[17:04:43] RebornStratos: @notagain15151 she had like 20k ready for yuno
[17:04:50] chaosgeek1: @sausagimiagi exactly, so people need to make money, and grind to a certain extent tohave the resources to do the cool stuiff that will be coming up
[17:04:53] miketwng: @RoyLeeTV aww man
[17:05:09] Fossabot:  Hey! See something funny in the stream? Clip it! Helps grow the channel :) share it on #stream-clips on !discord
[17:05:13] RebornStratos: whenever I see raia she grinds Snr buns
[17:05:21] AFFABLE__: Free the car DinkDonk
[17:05:30] RebornStratos: it’s practically a family business lol
[17:05:35] Lonext: wow jay hacks so fast
[17:05:38] Syntai_dev: @RebornStratos Ive watched her a lot recently and tbh she isnt grinding that place that often
[17:05:42] Fossabot: Metagaming is providing a streamer with relayed information that was learned outside of the immediate stream and is against the rules of the NoPixel server. This includes telling where other characters are and what they have done or are doing. tiny.cc/metagaming
[17:06:09] tarrasski: @affable__ he needs to wait 5days
[17:06:20] RebornStratos: @syntai_dev she’s selling computers now right?
[17:06:33] RebornStratos: sounds like a Yuno job
[17:06:46] Mars_nights: It still fees super weird seeing jay getting inside the vault and putting money in yeeBusiness yeeBusiness yeeBusiness yeeBusiness
[17:06:46] Syntai_dev: @RebornStratos She did stuff with her family, was hanging arround with Jasons group, did a bit of snr buns, was arround with yuno + timothy, does pc
[17:06:47] chaosgeek1: @sausagimiagi But thatw as AFTER most inresting and xpensive stuff legal and illegal was introduced
[17:06:48] Syntai_dev: all over the place tbh
[17:07:00] muffinplaysgames: I mean that would be an incentive for crims to not rob g6. So they can rob MORE from the bank
[17:07:03] Hikamari: isnt there some back access ? loading from the front seems weird
[17:07:04] TimePeace49: yeah someone else is starting to get her to work for them wont say who
[17:07:32] RebornStratos: lol robbing g6 for a dongle or something lol
[17:07:39] bahbus: hopefully the cooldown on robbing the bank is proportionate to the number of G6 people filling them back up
[17:07:40] indigodream_: @Alaineman if jay helps the cops he at minimum wont receive a felony. i can't remember the exact deal, it might even be no charges at all. and he'll get a fake charge i believe
[17:07:47] sandeep_bs: Kris how much have u made this Storm ? Hmm
[17:07:55] Alaineman: Wish they'd have a system to load the pallets onto a cart and push them to the vault instead of putting them in backpack/pockrts
[17:08:16] s13epy: It would be interesting if a crew had to steak out the vault for for a wave and wait for g6 trucks to carry money in so they can have a fat payout
[17:08:20] chaosgeek1: That would be a cool mechanic
[17:08:20] Mars_nights: The trailer had people chasing after the g6 t3
[17:08:24] Chanceemergency: @indigodream_ it's all charges dropped and a fake charge on his record in case anyone asks questions
[17:08:39] tripleduck: eh... that would also means there's a limit to the amount of g6 vault jobs
[17:08:45] tripleduck: so maybe not
[17:09:03] RebornStratos: like chop
[17:09:07] ithurtswhenlP2: Why not capitalize on both sides and rob you money you’re depositing after you’re finished …
[17:09:08] RoyLeeTV: Vault Friday would be way more hype
[17:09:25] RebornStratos: hahaha jackpot
[17:09:30] tripleduck: if you skip a hack by robbing a g6 employee of the keycard...
[17:09:50] isp1337: and crims would race to get the least money early from the vault :D
[17:10:34] Alaineman: This t3 is fast af
[17:10:40] RebornStratos: lol for heist they may even make it to rob the vault you need an inside man in g6
[17:10:53] argonize: what if you need an inside g6 man
[17:10:55] RebornStratos: lt would be funny like learn the bank system to rob it
[17:10:55] chaosgeek1: This truck must be pretty fun to drive, cause everythiong just bounces off of it
[17:10:55] muffinplaysgames: he hit A COP
[17:11:27] ChaoticRq: It would be cool if it alerted the hackers when you accept a job as a G6. That way there is a sense of urgency and not always guaranteed.
[17:11:27] drvinnie_boombat: Ya

[18:15:59] RebornStratos: why they thinking bags will give them dongles maybe
[18:16:11] Mundosaysyourfired: you get 10 dollars per bag
[18:16:14] itsissun: @Smurffyy7 does js mean just
[18:16:20] Mundosaysyourfired: and exiled from gruppe6

[18:16:47] MidKnightRider: https://imgflip.com/i/8czled
[18:16:48] GoldGuardianX: Did they scuff and try to steal bags instead of buying it like you did
[18:16:50] xxwolfie9xx: @Mundosaysyourfired fence rep
[18:16:55] SpellCooldown: Fuel
[18:17:08] Hexcart: @MidKnightRider om
[18:17:21] RidicUlust: Oh sheet this old man is still streaming
[18:17:31] Mundosaysyourfired: @xxwolfie9xx fence rep gives you nothing(?)
[18:17:39] Mundosaysyourfired: @xxwolfie9xx better off chopping than stealing gruppe6 bags
[18:17:44] RebornStratos: people will most likely steal the tier 3 pallet thinking it will lead to future things
[18:17:50] SonMontu: @MidKnightRider om
[18:17:53] Mundosaysyourfired: @xxwolfie9xx it's weird, hard criminal life right now
[18:18:25] MayaisAqt: yeah tier 3 would be tilting
[18:18:27] maofinn: @MidKnightRider good one
[18:18:30] Fossabot: Confused about all these random words such as peepoSit and Chatting ? Go download the FFZ browser extensions at frankerfacez.com . Then enable 7tv and BTTV in the settings. If you are still confused watch the video on !emotehelp
[18:18:35] RebornStratos: pretty sure at least one run of them has been stolen by now
[18:18:38] xxwolfie9xx: @Mundosaysyourfired for now.....it won't be nothing for long
[18:19:21] Mundosaysyourfired: @xxwolfie9xx because things are slow rolled or they are still deciding on how to roll crim stuff out, really any crim character is handicapped pretty much because they are spending so much exploring crim paths and ending up with no reward. It's better off at least financially if they just grinded a civ job
[18:19:44] Hexcart: yeeSip
[18:19:45] Smurffyy7: @rebornstratos check the rp channel in kriss discord PepeLa

[18:20:14] 5ynchr0nize: Malakai is him
[18:20:17] snikiturtul: because that rp earlier on in the stream would've worm me out emotionally Hm
[18:20:17] MidKnightRider: Dont be puss puss meow  like Jay
[18:20:19] maximusormous: wait i have heard this song
[18:20:20] pali1591: i mean stealing is stealing it dont matter if its 70 dollars or 1000
[18:20:22] maximusormous: what was this
[18:20:28] MAC_StriKer: mawakai peepoShy
[18:20:35] xxwolfie9xx: @Mundosaysyourfired crim stuff hasnt really happened yet. the only thing is the dark web
[18:20:38] MayaisAqt: malakai always been HIM
[18:20:38] Mundosaysyourfired: @xxwolfie9xx there's really only one crim job but requires you to have so much stuff to even do it and that's chopping
[18:20:52] 5ynchr0nize: don't be like Jay
[18:20:59] s13epy: Malakia is actually such a underrated character the dude is always just here to have a good time and enjoy RP
[18:20:59] Mars_nights: He is not wrong
[18:20:59] RebornStratos: they heavy though wonder where they gonna store them
[18:21:02] Mundosaysyourfired: @xxwolfie9xx you can say there's one crim occupation - chopping vs the other 7 or 8 civ occupations
[18:21:12] pali1591: he stole 70 now next time it will be 200
[18:21:12] GoldGuardianX: @pali1591 yeah but at least with the higher money there's a goal. The small amount shows its just to steal
