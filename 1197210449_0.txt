[4:05:27] djmonk3y1: Ya
[4:05:27] Encryptoh: @lobotomyblues ah thats good then probably still feels relatively fresh
[4:05:35] bacon_killer_: Has he given his opinion on the game?
[4:05:37] Mrjarquell: uhnMom *
[4:05:39] isDall: @DudleyIsDumb to me idc much about the combat of elden ring being "different", as long as they're able to keep it fun in the game. I wouldn't expect bayonetta level combat in it
[4:05:39] Francis5795: eww escort mission
[4:05:40] holydougdimmadome: the zombie map isn't even complete lol
[4:05:40] DudleyIsDumb: This is probably the saddest attempt at zombies I’ve seen from them yet, which says a lot
[4:05:44] KingpinKza: this is just pre-season lol
[4:05:48] 0xygenhomie: people paying $60 for this.. Sadge

[4:06:04] ohmygawww: 60 bucks for an unfinished game KEKW
[4:06:04] WhoisDamian: wait so im confused is this game even out yet or is it like early acesss KEKW
[4:06:06] Vitrykn: Zombies but an appetizer
[4:06:11] BL4K_RXZE: Onslaught
[4:06:12] Encryptoh: @brodizzleee wrong person srry chief
[4:06:19] Brodizzleee: np
[4:06:21] PrettyGoodSamuel: so this game mode is still in beta basically
[4:06:24] lobotomyblues: this wimpy knife sound tho
[4:06:31] GunsMann: Zombies aren't even something to be feared in this, they're just fodder
[4:06:34] Halakino: that melee hit sound KEKW
[4:06:34] DudleyIsDumb: @goldilicious I don’t expect it to be hugely different either, but it’s the exact same as souls. Like I said a hybrid between sekiro and souls would have been preferable
[4:06:46] Alectr0lytes: Yeah this was definitely rushed BibleThump
[4:06:51] mistermeowzersz: hello friends!
[4:06:51] lobotomyblues: @GunsMann WaW zombies scared me as a kid ngl

[4:07:52] Nuke_Liar: it is horrible
[4:07:56] Vitrykn: That dude is still kicking?
[4:08:08] Vitrykn: Haven't heard that name in years
[4:08:12] RinTempest: @colgatemp3 from fo4?
[4:08:25] DudleyIsDumb: @goldilicious exactly. Faster paced combat, more mechanics involved, smoother combat as well. It’s just the same system as their older games, even though sekiro shows they are capable of so much more @goldilicious
[4:08:27] HarrysonNorf: To me to put it blankly. Theres too much but those things arent fleshed out enough so its all just a bit of meh everything
[4:08:28] colgatemp3: Yeah, or at least it sounded like it
[4:08:30] GarrettTheCRUST: That’s exactly how i feel it just isnt zombies LUL

[4:10:01] isDall: @DudleyIsDumb sekiro came at the cost of limiting RPG elements of the game. they cant make movesets and interactions with multiple weapons with the same complexity as sekiro
[4:10:05] holydougdimmadome: a zombie with a gun?
[4:10:08] PrettyGoodSamuel: KEKW

[4:10:53] DudleyIsDumb: @goldilicious I know that, which is why I said they should have combined elements from both. The combat in Elden ring will be dated. I will still enjoy it but it will be dated.

[4:13:03] HarrysonNorf: @augish LUL LUL
[4:13:05] isDall: @DudleyIsDumb lol maybe i guess. I mean demon souls was released 10 years later, and that doesn't feel dated besides a few features.
[4:13:11] supernovaqqr: so they remade shino numa this time?
[4:13:15] Vitrykn: Don't worry it's an appetizer, not real zombies Kappa
[4:13:16] Brodizzleee: no more areas
[4:13:23] BolbiBaggins: @ShinyVagikarp that's because he used the sacrifce thingy in the middle of the map
[4:13:29] lobotomyblues: so im better off sticking with black ops 3 and cold war if i wanna play zombies?
[4:13:31] Brodizzleee: portals now repeat objective
[4:13:41] andyjet2000: He's not healing from the teeth buff, that seems to be extra crit damage. He's healing from the passive he has in the bottom left, next to his health.
[4:13:51] Brodizzleee: @lobotomyblues for now. This will get better as the year goes on, can't get worse :L
[4:13:54] EddieEXP: loving this knife gameplay, pretty uhnCozy
[4:13:59] Time2gam3: This game makes cod ghosts extinction look godsent
[4:14:00] Uriell197: This is like the fast zombie mode on Cold War.
[4:14:00] DudleyIsDumb: @goldilicious yes, the combat in demon souls felt dated, but people love dark souls still. The combat in them is dated as fuck, but the full games are fun.
[4:14:03] supernovaqqr: @lobotomyblues tbh just stick with bo3 bo2 and bo1
[4:14:05] lobotomyblues: @Brodizzleee Copege
[4:14:09] ShinyVagikarp: @BolbiBaggins gotcha I havent played zombies in a long time tbh

[4:15:04] dreadccc: On a positive note, forza horizon is amazing though lol
[4:15:06] DudleyIsDumb: Like I said, Elden ring will probably still be great but the combat being the old style from souls sucks.
[4:15:19] Lowkey1mLoki: @Time2gam3 I unironically had alot of fun with extinction, still preferred zombies obviously but I thought it was pretty decent.
[4:15:24] junglemints: uhnCozy
[4:15:31] Time2gam3: Extinction was great imo also
[4:15:35] ThatBoySasuke: The zombies in this game looks like a fever dream
[4:15:37] Brodizzleee: the portals repeat now
[4:15:50] datwrestlingguy: i miss wat black ops 1 2 and 3 zombies there i said it
[4:15:56] lobotomyblues: oh
[4:16:01] chocodreamzzz: this feels like they tried to add CW zombies stuff in to a updated version of COD zombies 3. but it just failed really hard LUL
[4:16:10] Time2gam3: Extinction actually properly executed an objective based mode well
[4:16:17] Aeg_Chief: bruh there's not even a rez animation uhnHead
[4:16:18] IPickRam: Melee only JamesPog
[4:16:24] Francis5795: KEKW no more revive animations

[4:16:45] lobotomyblues: PISS CHALICE
[4:16:47] supernovaqqr: @Time2gam3 i miss extinction mode
[4:16:48] Brodizzleee: @DatHomelessWrestlingGuy Cold War was pretty good. I took a break from zombies after 2 cuz dlc exclusivity. Think it did wonders tbh, I was, like a lot of people overly attached to the OG cast of characters
[4:16:56] DudleyIsDumb: I’m glad you played this so I didn’t waste 60 dollars @uberhaxornova
[4:16:59] Ultra_A136: more damage with headshots
[4:16:59] steezeRNG: hmm
[4:17:01] 0xygenhomie: anyone else trying out the lost ark beta?
[4:17:05] mercilessmemes: @time2gam3 literally the only thing that executed objectives properly

[4:17:32] lobotomyblues: 😬 this accent
[4:17:33] DeviLRy64: playing warlord rn.
[4:17:41] Uriell197: It sounds like dead shot from Cold War the cup animation is cool tho
[4:17:41] Time2gam3: Lotta people dont give extinction its props lol.. this cod could’ve learned a lot from it
[4:17:46] steezeRNG: ERW
[4:17:47] steezeRNG: EW
[4:17:48] Time2gam3: Objective wise
[4:17:51] julliethecutie: Purple is usually better than blue
[4:18:05] ikrjasy: I think the yellow perk does lifesteal as well
[4:18:06] lobotomyblues: what if i put a demolition charge in my ass
[4:18:11] DudleyIsDumb: @time2gam3 extinction wasn’t bad gameplay wise but it didn’t have longevity like zombies
[4:18:15] Jcal_pj17: I’m so confused they said it wasn’t round based but it says they’re round 7?
[4:18:29] dsiOne: KEKW
[4:18:32] Francis5795: KEKW
[4:18:34] isDall: @DudleyIsDumb well yeah the dream always was having Devil May Cry level complexity with Dark souls level variety, but obviously that's just a dream lol
[4:18:35] pteeepot: lmao
[4:18:36] Brodizzleee: @Darkblade164 nope. Just headshot damage. He has a "covenant" (bottom left icons), that gives him heals on melee
[4:18:38] supernovaqqr: @DudleyIsDumb people were turned off by aliens instead of zombies
[4:18:40] ShadyPCE: KEKW

[4:18:54] baked_flakes: you mounted it to the ground
[4:18:57] Time2gam3: @dudleyisdumb  true with a story like this they can honestly pull anything out of their ass and it’ll make sense in this game
[4:18:58] Brodizzleee: demo charge is just a C4
[4:19:00] PappyJayson2: James uhnKek
[4:19:01] Uriell197: It’s c4 hahaha
[4:19:05] DudleyIsDumb: And that’s one thing BO2 and 3. Zombies took from Extinction, which was progression to boss fights through Easter eggs @time2gam3
[4:19:07] isDall: @DudleyIsDumb in the meantime, we do have games close to that- if you want u can check out God hand
[4:19:25] dotzaq: He has 1.2k bullets on one gun in zombies wtf is this lmao

[4:19:45] Francis5795: oh ok
[4:19:47] DudleyIsDumb: Yeah wait why do you have unlimited fucking ammo
[4:19:48] Brodizzleee: @liquidrtlol was the same in Cold War with certain guns and attachments combos
