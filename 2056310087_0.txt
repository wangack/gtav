[0:15:32] KingJester: A week?
[0:16:02] garett789: No profit from the houses after paying investors even monthly
[0:16:05] MrYeOLDsNIPeR: lol, you didn't know you were paying rent to the state?
[0:16:17] CasualStoner: you live there for 2 months and payed more in taxes than the house itself
[0:16:23] tacos4daysz: Now I don't feel bad about people just paying cars and not houses
[0:16:30] Kdkuiper: may as well sell off the houses
[0:16:37] RyanTheeBook: server trying to keep the grinders in check and it's hurting the RP businesses
[0:16:56] Kagpirate: lol, at this point, it's not even worth to own a house
[0:17:02] kronostw: Gotta sue the government. I think it'd be an easy W. Cant continue to add in taxes and costs post purchase.
[0:17:03] cybigil: I guess nopixle wants the sever to be a grinding only server.

[0:17:49] Kdkuiper: it‚Äôs making doing the section K rp almost impossible to do
[0:17:54] nickh1981: i wouldnt be putting anymore money into it
[0:18:09] nickh1981: if you arent getting no money out of it
[0:18:48] natur666: then of top of that you need to pay 12% for selling where is the profit?
[0:18:57] natur666: on.
[0:18:59] Kdkuiper: so it‚Äôs asset fees again
[0:19:08] mextil_01: why no RP installing solar power free light bill
[0:19:26] Kagpirate: @Kdkuiper yep,
[0:20:04] Lepaca: don't forget to steal cable, the true american pastime
[0:20:26] kronostw: Really only screwing Section K. I doubt anyone else is being screwed by this because no one else is doing real estate.
[0:20:31] Kdkuiper: you have to increase rent
[0:20:33] garett789: add it to the power bill
[0:20:37] garett789: for the renters
[0:20:39] nickh1981: Investors are going to pull out lol
[0:20:50] Sp0rtsjunki3: Property tax shouldn't be more than 0.5%. And you don't charge sales tax on real estate
[0:20:52] nickh1981: they arent getting any money
[0:20:58] Kdkuiper: that reit pay out is fast approaching too
[0:21:02] Sp0rtsjunki3: Glad I don't live in that economy
[0:21:12] therealdankmoody: they trying to keep every one beat down poor cause they dont have any actual progress in what you can do for banks or crime so keep ya grinding shit like grime and cluck n bell. Devs lacking content so they beating peoples RP down instead.....
[0:21:19] 0Trish0: @kronostw tho some ppl said they got 500k power bill?
[0:21:28] Just_too_ez: They sort of made it the ultimate grinding server

[0:22:11] ItsEdBoi_: There is not tax evasion charge btw
[0:22:13] SFGMOD: its a random ass number
[0:22:24] RegulatorTTV: they should have some type of grandfather clause for this type of stuff
[0:22:25] darkdemonwiz: In no legislation does the state have authority to tax
[0:22:40] kronostw: @0Trish0 lol really. thats wild. lol I guess im more referring to property taxes and other random additives.
[0:22:41] RoronoaZoro: it‚Äôs just the same as asset fees in 3.0 it‚Äôs just gonna be a monthly bill on things

[0:29:19] RoronoaZoro: man since they brought back asset fees for houses I wonder if car asset fees are coming back too
[0:29:54] ItsEdBoi_: Sent u the quick math on disc
[0:30:01] ItsEdBoi_: % doesnt line up
[0:30:06] ItsEdBoi_: idk what its based on
[0:30:47] RoronoaZoro: @itsedboi_ are you talking about the new tax they are worrying about?
[0:31:03] ItsEdBoi_: Yea
[0:31:24] LavosTRD: Yes, Sean Tinker
[0:31:46] RoronoaZoro: @itsedboi_ pretty sure it‚Äôs just asset fees from 3.0 which kinda worked in a weird way
[0:31:55] irishmf_24: UNLEASH GOMER
[0:32:16] mikedav17: techincally all of gomers family are dead arent they?
[0:32:24] ItsEdBoi_: @RoronoaZoro What was it based on?

[0:33:00] RoronoaZoro: @itsedboi_ well for cars it was based on the class of car and how many you had multiplied it
[0:33:51] ItsEdBoi_: @RoronoaZoro So like the % varies by house??? that makes no sense, property tax should be a steady %
[0:34:03] LavosTRD: null and void
[0:34:12] boss_waka: @mikedav17 nah buck is still around once in a while
[0:34:41] RegulatorTTV: the state invalidated the agreements so you rewrite them or they are trashed
[0:34:41] ItsEdBoi_: only thing i can think of is the length of the house makes the % messy cause its like prorated
[0:34:46] TTNuge: time to go scorched earth
[0:34:49] mikedav17: @boss_waka i thought cinamon killed off bucky
[0:35:18] SFGMOD: screw everybody KEKW
[0:36:07] RegulatorTTV: could pay out the minimum contract obligation and start fresh
[0:36:17] internalin: that can't work. that means people can get out of any contract they want now
[0:36:49] MasameC: gomer, keep up the good work Clap
[0:36:49] SFGMOD: I mean, its literally in the laws
[0:36:53] RoronoaZoro: @itsedboi_ it‚Äôs weird because they don‚Äôt call it a tax or at least didn‚Äôt in the past it was just called asset fees and they only put it in the server to keep people playing and having to spend money lol so it got changed a lot in 3.0
[0:36:57] boss_waka: @mikedav17 nah he popped in 4.0 for a bit and dissapeared
[0:37:02] SFGMOD: you can just cancel all the contracts and keep the money
[0:37:09] SFGMOD: all the investors be screwerfd
[0:37:42] GamerGoat007: Common sense in Nopixel 4.0 timmacLUL timmacLUL timmacLUL timmacLUL

[0:37:48] ItsEdBoi_: @RoronoaZoro Thats crazyy lmao, different rates based on the specific house???
[0:37:54] RegulatorTTV: maybe notify the investors that the state nullified the contracts and have them go harass the city hall
[0:38:06] SFGMOD: blame the government for putting such an open ended law into effect
[0:38:16] SFGMOD: where you can screw the people under contract
[0:38:43] Rothnarge: K is gonna go off LUL
[0:38:52] ccoolracer128: its time to close all the houses take everything out and sell the houses lol
[0:38:54] RoronoaZoro: @itsedboi_ like for cars it didn‚Äôt multiply at first based on how many you had and what class so it wasn‚Äôt that expensive so they added that it multiples just to charge people more
[0:39:34] RoronoaZoro: @itsedboi_ which is probably why they called it asset fees instead of tax because it doesn‚Äôt exactly make the most sense
[0:39:39] Kdkuiper: look at number 5, you get free appt but then pay taxes on them?
[0:39:52] GamerGoat007: When is the new vote coming up. Vote these ppl our asap timmacLAUGH
[0:40:06] RegulatorTTV: can use that against other people as well
[0:40:09] WhoNeedsBullets: this is from judges ie no voting
[0:40:12] internalin: and what constitutes a group?
[0:40:14] RoronoaZoro: @kdkuiper you don‚Äôt pay tax on appt you pay for the utilities
[0:40:19] ItsEdBoi_: @RoronoaZoro I get what ur saying, those numbers need to be listed somewhere though
[0:40:29] RegulatorTTV: false reports incoming haha
[0:40:40] ItsEdBoi_: Or how are u supposed to do any actual math business wise
[0:41:14] Kdkuiper: @RoronoaZoro haha well the wording is really poor it says free housing, so people could fight that to include utilities as well
[0:41:18] Rothnarge: KEKW called it
[0:41:35] internalin: better only kill the council all at once
[0:42:16] RoronoaZoro: @itsedboi_ oh I agree I could be wrong and it could have a percentage but at least in 3.0 it didn‚Äôt seem as straightforward
[0:42:35] ccoolracer128: dont forget all your stuff at the courthouse

[0:43:32] RegulatorTTV: so does this mean K doesn‚Äôt owe you or anyone else money for the investments?
[0:43:33] Ryan_McDaniel: Sounds like the govt is taking a lot but what are they giving?
[0:43:57] Lordbidwell: A headache
[0:43:58] JenAndGame: Do you ever accidentally slip into Gomer voice irl, or use it on purpose irl?
[0:44:04] RoronoaZoro: I mean the government is barely even set up yet
[0:44:09] ccoolracer128: i think the money just disappears
[0:44:16] ItsEdBoi_: They made the paycheck come out of the state account i believe
[0:44:16] JenAndGame: Tax is a money sink
[0:44:24] JenAndGame: So the econ doesn't get too flooded
[0:44:30] JenAndGame: Power creep prevention
[0:44:34] ItsEdBoi_: idk if its just govt checks or all working checks
[0:44:38] ItsEdBoi_: yea its crazy
[0:44:56] drewkillsu: What's funny with this contract situation you guys can also keep collecting rent and not sign the house over in the end and evict tenets
[0:45:01] boss_waka: grab your car?
[0:45:06] RoronoaZoro: I mean 6k a month really isn‚Äôt that much for a house imo
[0:45:18] ItsEdBoi_: my theories is if its monthly its fine, or it might be back taxes based on time missed
[0:45:46] JenAndGame: This might be a test run and they may later reduce
[0:45:47] ItsEdBoi_: The math on it not being anywhere is ridiculous
[0:45:47] DavidLeeRussell: @roronoazoro that is not the tax rate anywhere in America that‚Äôs for sure and the economy seems even tighter in game
[0:46:04] LordOnslaught: crashing the economy early?
[0:46:15] ItsEdBoi_: @DavidLeeRussell a month in gta is like a year irl though
[0:46:22] harp3r861: hitting people with random taxes will put a lot of people off doing anything especially if they dont even warn about it
[0:46:41] ccoolracer128: so whats new at grime?
[0:46:42] boss_waka: agreed its bs
[0:46:45] JenAndGame: They also may want to take a chunk of money circulating out of the economy first, then they'll lower taxes to keep it at a slower growth
[0:46:54] MrNess47: only thing it does is hinder the people who want to facilitate roleplay that way
[0:46:59] 8R00KS: They need to announce these changes then implement them
[0:47:02] WhoNeedsBullets: aren't they taxing apartments as well? did the guy earlier say he had 1k tax on it?
[0:47:06] 8R00KS: not just slap more and more fees
[0:47:07] harp3r861: its almost the same as getting shot without any interaction
[0:47:12] RoronoaZoro: @harp3r861 it‚Äôs the same as the asset fees from 3.0 not saying I agree but the goal according to koil and devs is to keep people playing and stop people from getting too rich
[0:47:22] ItsEdBoi_: Like at least a weeks notice on that and the percents should be public

[0:47:54] DavidLeeRussell: @itsedboi_ that‚Äôs an arguable point I guess
[0:47:59] mordhaustv: 's like you're only allowed to make money if you work for group 6 or senior buns. not allowed to make money doing your own thing. have to work for the state or be broke.
[0:48:03] LordOnslaught: teleport
[0:48:19] Lorresnorre: If they are going to have high taxes. They also need actual politicians in the game... that acts corrupted and enrichen demselves from policy, tbh xD Then it makes sense. xD
[0:48:55] ItsEdBoi_: @DavidLeeRussell its not even arguable, its debatably illegal not publicly disclosing the process
[0:49:36] ItsEdBoi_: like power bill wtf is that based on, there should be a $ amount for every point on ur gauge
[0:49:47] ItsEdBoi_: and that needs to be disclosed
[0:49:54] harp3r861: can be planned for that way too
[0:49:57] Ryan_McDaniel: The citizens usually vote on the tax levees, why is this different.
[0:49:58] LordOnslaught: how much is the tax on vehicles and property?
[0:50:04] DavidLeeRussell: @itsedboi_ I wasn‚Äôt saying argue that I was saying the 30 days to a year deal
[0:50:13] boss_waka: oh god k is in demon mode
[0:50:26] Lordbidwell: Economy sim is great timmacTHUMB
[0:50:32] RoronoaZoro: @lordonslaught the tax on vehicles and property are different than the amount you gotta pay months for the fees so it doesn‚Äôt add up lol
[0:50:39] hippieh8rlol: It's really something that should have been brought up to you guys OOC or something. Like hey we see you're doing real estate rp and there a lot of systems not activated
[0:50:39] StreamElements: timmacHI
[0:50:40] spoobie09: 10k light bill is stupid I don't even pay 10k in a year
[0:50:41] ItsEdBoi_: @DavidLeeRussell oh my b thought u were refering to another msg
[0:50:56] DavidLeeRussell: @itsedboi_ they still seem high but I guess if that‚Äôs how you‚Äôre working it then 6k would be ideal on a $300k house that‚Äôs like 2% which is the highest in the us
[0:51:21] Lordbidwell: At what point do we say this is a game timmacBEG
[0:51:31] ItsEdBoi_: @DavidLeeRussell my napkin math is its like 2-4% of the house value

[1:44:53] spoobie09: Btw if you guys rent to own the house the cops lived in then you guys should throw another 40k on top of everything else for the floors walls and everything you put into it to decorate it

[3:00:39] ccoolracer128: if you guys brought the trailer for weed and get a cash storage for the place than you can be the cleaner that way too
[3:00:46] cybigil: It would definitely take a little while to get things going, but I think this is a good move to advance the weed game.  It will also get more people involved
[3:00:59] mskazzeboy: timmacPRIME timmacPRIME timmacPRIME
[3:01:23] unpainted4810: What's the end goal for the weed game? Do they end up making more money? Pushing on turf didn't seem like it made much money
[3:02:05] cybigil: Please make sure the trailer isn't in K or Ramme's name.  It needs to be in your name or Chodie's name.
[3:03:57] ccoolracer128: yea that trailer would be a 9s place if it got a raid on it lol

[10:25:42] toal2892: @niw18 I know, I was curious if they gave a reason when they asked him to
[10:25:49] Addyct: so the wooting wouldnt work either for that
[10:25:59] RavageFlame: yeah but after 30seconds he went back to KBM
[10:26:10] azmer1987: It felt like they hired some 24 year old marketing "genius' that was all hyped with a bunch of guidelines lol
[10:26:35] The_Smarticus: I tend to use controller for driving and flying on gta just so much easier
[10:26:47] wowdunni: why are legit all the lights red when u first get to them
[10:26:47] SmugPls: @toal2892 the goal of the reset was to try and get people to make new storylines/characters. The push was for everyone to sort of do so. But only the PD is really being held to that.
[10:26:51] Lepaca: is there a ISO standard for collecting trash? LUL
[10:26:59] LuckyCharmsForBreakfast: a lot of injured persons this morning
[10:27:08] komplike: thats weird, i remember they testing controller at the beginning and it was just full accel or none 1/0
[10:27:10] GeoTru: @The_Smarticus That's how I am in pretty much all PC games. Controller sits on my lap for when I'm in a vehicle, KBM otherwise.
[10:27:45] Lepaca: trash day uhsDink

[10:48:59] LuLoc: NODDERS
[10:49:01] GeoTru: I just picked up the DLC, started over my first character to play it
[10:49:08] Lepaca: scriminal cumbags
[10:49:10] jayc0nn0r: never played it
[10:49:14] a_breadcrumb: yeah its one my faves
[10:49:20] GeoTru: I hadn't played since before all the cyberware updates
[10:49:23] Pikes37: sequel already leaked
[10:49:26] GeoTru: Oh yeah, intro felt identical
[10:49:31] toal2892: my only playthrough, I accidently got skippy stuck in limb firing mode, and wanted to cry for the rest of my life.
[10:49:31] Null_Value: DLC is pretty fun. Its going to be pretty same-y for the most part until you get to the DLC and the story around that picks up.
[10:49:32] staslist: first few hours are similar but its much better as a whole
[10:49:40] LuckyCharmsForBreakfast: cyberpunk is severely underrated
[10:49:43] nox503: dogtown ads new skill tree and quest to do

[10:49:51] ParashootTV: I did a new playthrough after the DLC and it felt great. The intro was the same you're right. I ended up putting 120+ hours into the main story though, it's worth it.
[10:50:09] nox503: adds
[10:50:13] staslist: Pacifica
[10:50:21] staslist: When you reach pacifica in main story *
[10:50:28] Pikes37: you can skip to it when starting new character
[10:50:30] Null_Value: Mid to late play-through you'll get to it. After Pacifica stuff usually.
[10:50:38] nox503: follow the goro quest line
[10:50:45] GeoTru: You could probably rush the main story and get there pretty quick
[10:50:51] staslist: ~10 hours? depends on if you rush main story
[10:50:54] leo_bwo: @toal2892 same lmfao but that was when the game first dropped. havent played since
[10:50:59] Null_Value: If you rush, you could probably do it in 10 or so but not sure on that.
[10:51:01] ParashootTV: DLC you can start doing in Pacifica, it's probably around halfway through the main story. If you rush it, 20-30 hours maybe less? I'm a completionist so my time is way off on that stuff.
[10:51:01] SwollenPlastic: Around the Voodo boys quests. Like 10hrs?
[10:51:04] SneakyBastrd_: Gomer stole a PD cruiser? Pog
[10:51:06] a_breadcrumb: yeah if you rush it should be pretty quick
[10:51:13] toal2892: @leo_bwo The pain is real
[10:51:18] leo_bwo: He just flip you off? lmfao
