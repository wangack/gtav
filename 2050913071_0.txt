[3:30:54] npr3333: it's all about leverage you lost it when you remove the accessory charges
[3:31:10] minich4rmander: @Paxipher the devil is often in the detail. just because a few officers saw something doesnt mean a charge cant be fought
[3:31:14] theredfrosts: Damn
[3:31:21] volibearrr28: @stellar49 he was clean before, maybe wants to do legal business who knows?
[3:31:23] enser27: : to shake or wave (something, such as a weapon) menacingly. brandished a knife at them. 2. : to exhibit in an ostentatious or aggressive manner.
[3:31:30] combattingjosh: @minich4rmander At the end of the day. It's hearsay
[3:31:30] analzuchini: @paxipher even if he does win it he‚Äôs literally going to spend like 10x the initial time trying to fight it

[3:32:15] Paxipher: @minich4rmander correct, but something like this when there was an admitted guilty stabbing, and others admitting guilty, is a waste of time completely. this is guilty by association and also witnesses
[3:32:20] DECD: its ruth Gazing
[3:32:22] Athasin: @enser27 Keep in mind the server has their own definition for charges that might not coincide with the dictionary

[7:53:01] PSturtle: Doing illegal shit -> Rolled Cash -> Washed Cash -> Money Order So having rolled cash implies they did some illegal shit to obtain it, but a money order just implies they would just have washed cash. It's not illegal to wash cash, and you take normal cash and wash it. So it's going to be extremely hard to prove that money order is illegal

[9:11:28] syed997: he had a mask on in game but was scuffed
[9:11:30] marneraiders: Ming too good, perfect car for that escape route
[9:11:35] minich4rmander: @Dylan658658 his mask scuffed and they id him
[9:11:40] ramsin50: @strawhatshaneo chill man don‚Äôt go there
[9:11:43] purplepoodle89: @mizzikk2401 framejob
[9:11:43] Wyczolek: @Dylan658658 they do he's mask poofed
[9:11:43] nick_dr1ft: @Dylan658658 apparently
[9:11:44] fartybum: mask scuffed : L but great job DEAN on not metaing i think in those situations mods need to swap to emote super early
[9:11:48] Tiltkrille: How do you know its mr K? His mask got scuffed/bugged
[9:11:50] xypher85: @Xxfoxy10 you still here bitch?
[9:11:56] m4l1kkk: Why doesn't anyone put their names in the glove box or trunk?
[9:12:02] Diaz10gtg: @Tiltkrille how do the police know that?
[9:12:05] Rascal_PM: You did good Deano, called out exactly what happened without being too specific
[9:12:08] MDM4ever1986HD: those metagaming your mum should have kept her legs shut and you dad spunked on her tits
[9:12:09] Wyczolek: @Tiltkrille you have to roll with it
[9:12:12] nick_dr1ft: ye poofing mask's is kind of scuffed, but glad they just play it out
[9:12:13] combattingjosh: @Tiltkrille Dean didn't know that OOC. Could see his face
[9:12:13] Dylan658658: oh ffsü§£ scuffing ruining the RP
[9:12:22] xxxelfie: @Tiltkrille you literally just answered the question yourself
[9:12:23] troyofathyns: well even if you saw him you can't prove that it was him because you didn't take a photo
[9:12:26] marneraiders: They should really add personalized parking spaces
[9:12:29] syed997: tbf dean doesn‚Äôt know his mask was scuffed but they should deffo not put warrant
[9:12:34] sterred: So many chatters with an US vs THEM mentality for the streamers they prefer, just accept all these RPers are doing an epic job and enjoy the situations. None of this would work without the other parties whether its crims or cops. Your chat hopping info ruins the RP, ya helping no one, especially not the streamers you claim to support
[9:12:34] L7TRIP: @troyofathyns not how iut works sadly
[9:12:36] J05l4H: They only have resisting arrest its not that deep
[9:12:39] ruttdog21: @xypher85 KEKW hes probably gone back to hate watching K
[9:12:40] Zunnun: @tiltkrille everyone saw his face ooc not deans issue that it was scuffed

[9:12:46] palle322: yes
[9:12:47] desleeplays: yea
[9:12:47] xfreshdash: could they identify the suspect?
[9:12:47] emma_louise2212: yea

[9:12:55] jas3370: thats too bad RP it out
[9:12:56] grntcr: yeah he took it off and it disappeared
[9:12:58] Rascal_PM: All the chat hoppers "yea"
[9:12:58] elliottq4: yes
[9:12:59] Zunnun: I guess idk
[9:13:00] m4l1kkk: Unidentifiable unless someone snitches
[9:13:01] mattyicelb: yes fully lol it disappeared
[9:13:02] Alkemiee: his mask was off
[9:13:02] ramsin50: it wasn‚Äôt scuffed he took it off and it disappeared i think
[9:13:04] xsilas43: lmfao the hoppers
[9:13:07] heftylefty_prime: @Tiltkrille How are they supposed to know its scuffed? Especially if he doesn't come out and say "my mask scuffed".
[9:13:11] desleeplays: it was scuffed
[9:13:13] combattingjosh: roll with the punches
[9:13:19] marneraiders: a murder‚Ä¶.
[9:13:21] Zunnun: They saying he took it off once deano
[9:13:22] OiAM_Paka: If your gun jam how is that my fault tho
[9:13:23] TummyD: @ramsin50 that is scuff then KEKW
[9:13:29] Tiltkrille: @heftylefty_prime K is playing it out as he should
[9:13:29] minich4rmander: @heftylefty_prime thats what chat is for
[9:13:30] BabyJoker: had a mask for the crime but not when seen so thats why itll be a real iffy warrant. matching clothing will not be enough
[9:13:31] Zunnun: And it dissappeared after
[9:13:31] iiamrenegade: she really shouldnt have seen him
[9:13:38] Tiltkrille: He doesnt care
[9:13:40] nick_dr1ft: @heftylefty_prime he cant see, for him mask was on at the end
[9:13:40] stellarnaut: the thing is PD is expected to roll with scuff but not crims LOL
[9:13:41] xypher85: @fartybum our chat is usually well behaved, we cant guess who's the other player on the other side so it takes time for the hoppers to hop
[9:13:41] xsilas43: he took it off lmao
[9:13:47] Jochem0000: @Zunnun took it off tried to put it back on and it scuffed
[9:13:49] combattingjosh: @iiamrenegade in a third person game? No way
[9:13:52] Sparty071: It is what it is
[9:13:54] SeaOfEmpty: He knew he didn't have one, but didn't know where his mask went or why. So yeah, it was kinda bugged and he should have had a mask
[9:13:57] nick_dr1ft: K will roll with it tho if they do
[9:14:03] Diaz10gtg: u guys acting like everyone have to know when things scuff or something xdd
[9:14:05] MDM4ever1986HD: @fartybum true
[9:14:05] BabyJoker: chat hoppers dont realize could crossban
[9:14:15] Iam_VKA: @iiamrenegade Bro stop.
[9:14:17] syed997: k always get screwed by scuff game ü§£
[9:14:21] SixSidedSquare: @stellarnaut I agree, can you gift me a sub to adeptthebest.
[9:14:21] FLEETGOD1: took it off and it just disappeared in his pockets like 15sec before he was spotted.
[9:14:22] Tiltkrille: @stellarnaut calma .. K is playing it out he doesnt care lol... Its the chathoppers
[9:14:24] minich4rmander: but lets be honest here if he gets a attempted second degree murder charge for wearing black and he was like 2 miles away from the scene. i dont know.
[9:14:35] MDM4ever1986HD: @iiamrenegade stfu bro
[9:14:38] Zunnun: @jochem0000 yeah but the issue is that kebun should've ooced it then when they where id him cause how would the officers know
[9:14:48] Alkemiee: Mary's always clear?
[9:14:57] xsilas43: @minich4rmander, he was chased from the scene lil bro
[9:14:59] Zunnun: People saying it was scuffed it is still meta/backseating
[9:15:00] stellarnaut: @Tiltkrille im talking to the hoppers Mr K is fine im sure he doesnt care
[9:15:03] Rascal_PM: WHILE YOURE HERE CHAT HOPPING AND COMPLAINING, HIT THE FOLLOW BUTTON

[9:15:06] Diaz10gtg: @xsilas43 not really
[9:15:07] Jochem0000: @Zunnun yeh for sure i think he just does not care because you cant prove it in court anyways
[9:15:07] cmnylHD: So really what you saw, did and knew at the time is what happened for Denz. Don't let chat meta or chat hoppers get in your head Dean. You're doing great <3
[9:15:16] Iam_VKA: @minich4rmander lil bro thinks he's a Judge and giving convictions here in chat.
