If you use something called “NordVPN” you can use an app to tell netflix a goofy little lie and tell them that your IP is actually based in a different country, so if you want to watch The Office (Which is only available in UK) You can use NordVPN to change your IP to somewhere in UK [Temporarily] and then access region locked shows!

[2:38:59] KAETNN: same here
[2:38:59] IAmKayli123: its hard being a new twitch streamer because the trend is the "latest game" and people watch it and I cant afford buying the new games and so no one is bothered with you....
[2:39:00] The_C2G: Me too Sadge
[2:39:02] jester1256hd: i wannaget ps4 dayz gone

[2:39:19] xcornpops: same Sadge
[2:39:23] siryork1: could the attention span with games been because of the sleep apnoea?
[2:39:26] KingKova: I’m the same.
[2:39:31] bluefatcrab69: Same BibleThump
[2:39:33] PersistentGoat: Nothing matches the dopamine of rp interaction
[2:39:35] EthMage: how about god of war?
[2:39:36] lowren78: and yeah, crime brûlée in the tunnel next time Mike and Tomathy are on.
[2:39:44] Juicewisdom: axeumSip
[2:39:52] TheDivinos: gotta grind a niche
[2:39:58] TheDivinos: then expand
[2:40:00] BillNyeTheSauceGuy: do something you're good at or can be entertaining with
[2:40:01] im_jennifer_81: Dr. Mario 💊💊💊💊
[2:40:11] Nightbot: internet social interaction: https://twitter.com/imaSpaceboy

[2:41:01] DuckmanGamingLive: facts
[2:41:01] BillNyeTheSauceGuy: now do something like Mordhau

[2:41:10] BillNyeTheSauceGuy: with nobody streaming it lol
[2:41:10] h_u_r_k_: thats me lol
[2:41:18] EwaldBrosodi: yeah no shit lmao
[2:41:23] Nightbot: if you are subbed and still receiving ads, try disabling adblock. idk why but apparently it works. subs should NOT get ads
[2:41:29] Guruguy69: Kingmaker slots baybee
[2:41:31] Monopally: not wrong
[2:41:37] DuckmanGamingLive: truth
[2:41:49] hazel_m_: does anyone else love watching gamers but hate gaming?
[2:41:50] Nightbot: we know you don't like ads and we don't care how many you got please stop updating us we're all in this together
[2:41:55] SkaldFKACC: that's kinda smart right there.
[2:41:58] Ziaoko: true some niche game you have an interest in will always have someone else who'll be interested
[2:42:02] IAmKayli123: thats good advice thankyou :)
[2:42:09] the_fuddy: Also a good thing to do is play games you love to play, if the game bores you it's not going to be enjoyable to watch
[2:42:22] Saumz: NODDERS
[2:42:24] Stealthkillah122: For me any channel with follow only as i enter is instant nope
[2:42:26] AlteredSoul_: plus working with other platforms to get more people because twitch discoverability sucks
[2:42:37] loshebro: as a viewer. I do the same thing you just did lol
[2:42:39] raver31: skyrim rp

[2:42:52] TheoneLOLA: Advice for people who struggle being entertaining?
[2:43:07] kaylaruki: Lmao the pants 😭😭
[2:43:09] KingKova: once I grew up and got a job, I bought every single game I could just because I couldn’t afford them growing up. I ended up playing less than half and quite a bit still had wrappers on them. it’s hard to find me a good game that I throw hours in. I’ve been playing Subnautica…any game I never wanted to play when I was younger. loving those kind of games
[2:43:16] SkaldFKACC: people also seem to like watching people play games that will eventually make them cry, if YT is anything to go by lol
[2:43:18] KashiCraze: I would love to see James Randal Skyblivion RP
[2:43:19] Stealthkillah122: @stock1979  metal gear solid 3 was mine. Glad there remastering
[2:43:20] Donnie_Draccoo: oh my glob so motivation

[2:43:46] Donnie_Draccoo: just be better that’s all
[2:43:54] AnonymousVodka: just had a phone call from simon cowell he wants his pants back james
[2:43:56] stock1979: Metal gear was also really good
[2:43:56] BillNyeTheSauceGuy: i only watch YT pretty much, so it's cool to see what you talk about in your down time
[2:43:58] raver31: life is strange as a watch
[2:44:00] tailerNOTtrailer: exactly
[2:44:07] TheDivinos: u can only go up

[2:44:12] BillNyeTheSauceGuy: do it for fun
[2:44:15] b2a80: do it for fun
[2:44:18] yaboigorn: the odds ARE gainst you, but fuck those odds, do what you want
[2:44:20] tailerNOTtrailer: it’s all about having fun as a small streamer for sure
[2:44:23] BillNyeTheSauceGuy: @b2a80 clone Pog

[2:44:30] Ziaoko: if you go in for the money and success you'll never get it
[2:44:33] siryork1: you should not hinge any bet on succeeding on twitch, get a job, carry on as normal, if twitch takes off great, if not oh well
[2:44:36] Brutus_Antony: Don't do it to make it big, do it because you enjoy it.
[2:44:39] Stealthkillah122: I still remember your irl bad pizza streams with cyr xD
[2:44:48] KingKova: doing it because you want to. you’ll naturally do better at it and burnout will come slower
[2:44:54] T_Fuzzy: thats a mindset i try and use day to day. "expect the worst, hope for the best!"

[2:45:04] worldofkaykan: jump grandpa
[2:45:07] z1r0_sn0w: Idk if this helps, but I find that I'm drawn to people who very much enjoy what they talk about if they're talking about anything as well while they game or rp. Even if it's just random shit. It's probably why I just don't watch a lot of streamers outside of spaceboy.
[2:45:24] passh1: spbComfy
[2:45:26] z1r0_sn0w: Helps if you love what you're doing and it shows, basically.

[2:46:27] fleek008: DO A FLIP
[2:46:43] Ziaoko: Any advice for people wanting to start streaming but have too much anxiety from their family?
[2:46:45] worldofkaykan: 1
[2:47:01] BillNyeTheSauceGuy: drama
[2:47:15] yaboigorn: like lord kebun?
[2:47:15] TheDivinos: 10k+ streamers cant even play games normally
[2:47:15] LoganLive: Yeahhh that's way too much stress
[2:47:18] VR_NULL: chat goes too fast in there for me
[2:47:18] Ebbs_69: the way I see it, if you’re someone who enjoys playing video games and you think you can make something out of it, give it a go. if in the end it doesn’t work out, no harm.
[2:47:20] TheDivinos: they get sniped in every game
[2:47:21] EmMazingRP: I met you for the first time the other day in the server, you are hilarious 🤣
[2:47:22] tailerNOTtrailer: I found you from tiktok and I’m just glad that the vibes are as good here as I thought
[2:47:23] AeroSpaceWill: any advice for someone going through competitive job interviews in the middle of College and struggling to mentally relax?
[2:47:32] AKtion__47: i like the james inside jokes that only the community knows. mainstream is overrated
[2:47:45] goose_with_socks: rather be the “niche internet celebrity” less stress
[2:47:46] hiperfin: This is gonna be (kind of) random, but I want to thank you for talking so openly about your CPAP use the other day. I gave up on using mine a while back because I couldn't get a good seal and kept waking up with cotton mouth, but I used it last night and woke up feeling so incredibly rested. I hate myself for giving up on it.
[2:48:28] BillNyeTheSauceGuy: is content with what he has Chadge
[2:48:30] leavethegnome: concert time lets gooo
[2:48:37] TommyPolo: Yo Soaceboy been a long while since I’ve been able to pop into stream but I see you’ve been killing it, keep it up brotha

[2:49:42] pillbug: is that shit expensive sometimes
[2:49:43] LoganLive: When I streamed full time for 3 months like 4 years ago, I did it with no expectations. I ended up having one guy that came into every stream and hanging out the whole time. That one friendship made streaming all those hours worth it. It's all about your perspective and why you're doing it.
[2:49:44] StreamElements: twitch chat is a group of people if ur one guy and filling the chat with ur own messages one after the other really fast please don't lmao

[2:50:01] DavidGreenz: instead of AutoZone its SpaceBoyZone lol
[2:50:07] VR_NULL: he's avoiding a lot more that people
[2:50:07] justjames126: i always put my expectations low so if i dont do a lot its whatever if i do more then i was expecting it gives more gradification for me atleast
[2:50:11] Red_Rune: his chat is a jumbled mess lol
[2:50:23] worldofkaykan: xqc from quebec he just hates it here 😂

[2:53:41] HOLEMEDIA: also kind of a lazy response
[2:53:44] VECTORIUSpt: its the "just endure it bro"
[2:53:45] beckerson_: reminds me of doctors being like "ohh bad cramps? that's just part of being a lady!" and then it's a severe disease
[2:53:50] beckerson_: why can't doctors do their jobs
[2:53:51] dexidinosaur17: James be careful

[2:55:45] hiperfin: I wish I would have learned about sleep apnea years ago, but it wasn't until I was 30 that I finally got a sleep study. My family used to call me a "jungle cat" because of how loud I would snore. When we'd go on vacation they'd literally put me in a separate hotel room so they could all get sleep LUL

[3:51:10] im_jennifer_81: spbPictureOfOldMan
[3:51:11] AleisterPheles: I feel very immersed in this police rp
[3:51:12] M3NT4LIST: @sirbombabba & flirting with doctors :p
[3:51:22] sirbombabba: @M3NT4LIST Insane
[3:51:22] keebwee_: if only the police had been there maybe the crisis wouldve been averted </3 rip
[3:51:23] BillNyeTheSauceGuy: @justjon2099 might as well make it an arena at this point
[3:51:33] dragonlord07jv: This police rp is so realistic
[3:51:35] Cabbagepatchclown_: snr buns gladitorial combat arena
[3:51:35] pthekid: Andy prob just dressed as a baby and wondering where you go

[3:51:45] justjames126: police in america be like
[3:51:47] Snackclip: Kappa Kappa
[3:51:47] BitterNine: would James Randal say it manhole or man’s hole?
[3:51:51] forzafan354: @spaceboy if you had 60k to buy a sports car what would you get?
[3:51:54] ceige48: what’s worse no response to a terrorist threat or gunning down a surrendering old man in the hospital
[3:51:58] sirhomelessjoe: Seems like a ghost town or James is in purgatory
[3:52:05] frobllin: frobllin subscribed with Prime. 
[3:52:12] Nymphadora18: Nymphadora18 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[3:52:42] jawshpalm: This is very sombre
[3:52:51] justjon2099: Will we get Officer James Randal?
[3:52:51] slider_21: why no car
[3:52:56] Minato_in_Texas: @slagathor70 I'll call all the men Daves and the ladies Debbies.. Oh Cool Debby is my real name... Then if fairness to the other students I'll name you Slagathor...
[3:52:57] womengetter: post terrorism shennanigans
[3:52:58] frobllin: First ever stream I could catch, on those EU times. Always watch the videos. I love them :)
[3:53:00] confuzionfv: theres probs alot of people at this concert aha
[3:53:01] pthekid: If James is saying slowly, its gonna be REALLY slow
[3:53:02] dylanconlon6: James needs to see cornwood off duty
[3:53:03] static_nacho: the middle is the safest
[3:53:03] sirhomelessjoe: Purgatory James forever without burger
[3:53:15] lamknot: baby smuggling time?
[3:53:18] forzafan354: @spaceboy if you had a budget of 50,000 or lower what kind of car would you buy?
[3:53:21] raz_c0la: Cornwood wouldn't have come anyways if it was sr buns, he hates those calls

[3:53:38] Minato_in_Texas: @slagathor70 Scrubs reference?
[3:53:56] idol_spork: LUL  Perfectly NORMAL day..
[3:54:06] justjon2099: I swear the cops don't respond to half the city at this point.
[3:54:08] pancake357: @pthekid i think so
[3:54:32] BoatSquad: Cops just showed up lol
[3:54:40] BillNyeTheSauceGuy: what's even happening there
[3:54:46] LilMaGooby: Cops were extremely active a few hours ago
[3:54:54] beastly100: @boatsquad i’d say meta but holy fuck LUL
[3:54:54] StreamElements: don't tell spaceboy what's happening in other roleplay streams let him learn organically
[3:54:56] pthekid: So everyone must be senile
[3:54:59] Nightbot: if you are subbed and still receiving ads, try disabling adblock. idk why but apparently it works. subs should NOT get ads
[3:55:02] iithum12: no more bombas till more cops
[3:55:02] BitterNine: low numbers and morale
[3:55:07] Cabbagepatchclown_: its not low numbers, theres other stuff goin on too
[3:55:08] 1nk_edd: james cop ark
[3:55:13] bigbudonky: Easy time to join
[3:55:13] jerry_lucifer: they just need pat back on
[3:55:15] BillNyeTheSauceGuy: like everyone commits crimes
[3:55:15] Jaritoh: doesnt help that they just fired den quincy
[3:55:16] AvaLouiseismee: i went away for 30min i come back and you're still running oh god
[3:55:20] sirhomelessjoe: @confuzionfv !!!!!
[3:55:22] iiqwertz_: I think the number of cops has to do with the leadership style
[3:55:24] devilemoni: @Jaritoh WAIT WHAT
[3:55:26] devilemoni: ON TWITCH
[3:55:26] nate2l8: they suspended so many cops over little things
[3:55:27] Rebsdorf_TFT: Drama, standards, new sops
[3:55:28] devilemoni: OR NP?!
[3:55:28] bigbudonky: Ive been waiting for james to be a cop
[3:55:28] BDG_ScubaSteve: low numbers morale thers a lot going on in PD rp wise right now too
[3:55:29] Nymphadora18: james as a cop would kill me XD
[3:55:30] confuzionfv: @sirhomelessjoe Helloooo
[3:55:31] JacksonCTV: it a combination of a lot of things
[3:55:32] lilebae: pat on the back
[3:55:32] MeatyLuis: I think they're doing more RP than PD now, and I like that
[3:55:32] Murader420: its time for james to become PD
[3:55:35] BenG_1802: would help if they weren't firing everyone lol
[3:55:37] jawshpalm: They really need a wake up call
[3:55:39] Cabbagepatchclown_: not too busy, like low morale caused by drama causing officers to protest pd
[3:55:41] Cabbagepatchclown_: etc.
[3:55:41] lovelee___: low numbers is the main issue along with lack of leadership
[3:55:43] pancake357: patdowning?
[3:55:44] MeatyLuis: but a lot slips through
[3:55:45] Nymphadora18: pulling people just to mess with them
[3:55:50] VECTORIUSpt: 1 minute RP = 30 minutes writting essays from the cops, that could be a bit revamped
[3:55:51] idol_spork: They need a good father figure..
[3:55:53] GremLynneXO: JamesSalute officer james when
[3:55:54] Blaze_sontagami: Pat Vigilante time
[3:55:55] BillNyeTheSauceGuy: to be fair, it is from james lol
[3:55:59] BenG_1802: Yeah there's a lot of drama with the PD at the minute
[3:56:01] BDG_ScubaSteve: there's a big ass rift in the PD right now to put it simply
[3:56:02] pthekid: That aint no baby
[3:56:04] LilMaGooby: Morale is fine aside from a couple vocal officers who are being problematic anyway.   There is a lack of leadership right now though
[3:56:05] Rebsdorf_TFT: prob 1 more month before they get a new pd chain of command
[3:56:07] Jaritoh: @devilemoni yea he was suspended for like 3-4 days? and then they made him wait like 4 hours for a meeting and then the capt dragged out the meeting and ultimately fired him off the force
[3:56:10] BillNyeTheSauceGuy: the james who cried 911
[3:56:10] raz_c0la: Lunatic
[3:56:11] toddicus: lol
[3:56:14] beastly100: bebè
[3:56:15] grasspuppies372: ooomy
[3:56:16] budda1026: the Pd Needs Pat
[3:56:16] sirbombabba: Nobody wants to do anything because captains just dap for everything
[3:56:29] pthekid: He's got his little toesie woesies out
[3:56:49] Rebsdorf_TFT: xdd
[3:57:03] Jaritoh: i think aziz and cornwall got suspended
[3:57:06] BitterNine: it’s also self feeding with low numbers. low numbers lower morale, morale lowers the numbers. idk how much that applies here thi
[3:57:07] PlayerDee: his body was so contorted lol
[3:57:07] pancake357: it may be a mix?
[3:57:08] Blaze_sontagami: I’ve seen cops get Dap’d for roleplaying situations out instead of doing it by the book
[3:57:09] wackywithwoodz: James is an elderly Truman in the sequel of the Truman Show
[3:57:10] lemonbuttons: i think they're trying to get too structured for "fun" cop rp
[3:57:11] Cabbagepatchclown_: @Jaritoh, aziz didnt
[3:57:20] idol_spork: googoo gagas
[3:57:31] Cabbagepatchclown_: @Jaritoh, denzel got fired and next day cornywoo got suspened indefinitely
[3:57:39] bazooka_brainz: who plays andy?
[3:57:40] StreamElements: plays Check to see if the character you're looking for is currently live: https://nopixel.hasroot.com/
[3:57:48] iiqwertz_: the cops who want to be cops want GOOD rp but leadership doesn't allow for GOOD rp, it's very serious rp the leadership go for
[3:57:56] xtrainhobo: I think they need to loosen up on the strictness of how PD is currently
[3:57:57] Minato_in_Texas: Bubbles the clown

[3:58:19] ceige48: I left to osvoldos stream to see what was happening and I just come back to “it’s a sexual thing” spbMUL spbMUL spbMUL
[3:58:27] Dantares24: serious cop RP seems fine when they are well staffed, but when its like this with low numbers they should probably be able to get away with a few more things without always getting a dap
[3:58:37] idol_spork: PLEASE.. My bebe is hungry.. where's windsong? LUL
[3:58:57] pthekid: Bringing a baby to coachella challenge
[3:59:00] LevelUpMindy: Whoa this gonna cause drama
[3:59:01] VECTORIUSpt: extra spicy
[3:59:02] Saumz: CurseLit
[3:59:06] LilMaGooby: Hiring will help
[3:59:10] loganlogo57: James gets an elderly discount and baby gets in free it's the perfect plan
[3:59:11] ripley_eight_: Too far
[3:59:11] babypunch92: youre "spacey" take
[3:59:12] justjon2099: Cornwood would have shown up
[3:59:12] qtip126: you aint wrong. it'd filter out the riff raff to the riff raff
[3:59:17] rouemu: LUL
[3:59:18] AleisterPheles: they've gotta keep them, too
[3:59:19] SuspiciousDeli: I see it as roleplay vs ruleplay issues. They want cop characters, not character cops. It makes it hard for people that have good RP reps to make/build stories vs just responding to them.
[3:59:26] Donnie_Draccoo: I’ll laugh if most are at the concert
[3:59:46] pthekid: That's a'more?
[3:59:48] PrickBehind: I could see them having to be at the concert for “security”
[3:59:49] Foreverdead3: The backend stuff since 4.0 has seemed a bit... "weird"
[3:59:51] jorrdynrenee: yeah they’re aren’t many so why fire the ones they do have LUL
[3:59:55] MonoclePig: +1
[4:00:11] iiiankao1215: spbWyd
[4:00:18] Foreverdead3: Just saw the governement changed prison sentences to be "minutes" instead of "months"
[4:00:20] pthekid: And there's Da
[4:00:24] Cabbagepatchclown_: @Foreverdead3, ya some stuff has been super exelerated while other stuff is stuck in the stone age
[4:00:31] nate2l8: boss baby mode
[4:00:31] Cabbagepatchclown_: made progression weird
[4:00:37] pthekid: and BossBaby
[4:00:42] TheSweetTatertot: Lil' Baby
[4:00:46] SneakyxOctopus: RDR2 Morag was great!
[4:00:48] Cabbagepatchclown_: KEKW
[4:00:51] MercuryShore: Imagine Randal at the Wuchang concert.
[4:00:51] ashtern_: @foreverdead3 I hate that so much, minutes is too cursed
[4:00:52] LilMaGooby: Character cops can exist, but they have to be able to dial in at any moment. McNulty is the perfect example of a character that perfectly handles the balance of silly and serious
[4:00:57] The_C2G: babytron KEKW
[4:00:59] budda1026: there’s Dababy
[4:01:01] Deakula: There's mimi rappers, and then there's honk shoe rappers
[4:01:05] static_nacho: there is also Da baby
[4:01:06] itsmelonsworld: is he running to the concert? lmaoooo
[4:01:08] BitterNine: where is the concert?
[4:01:11] spookyspookyliz: baby driver
[4:01:14] LaikaInMyDreams: I'd love to see a cop rank for fun cop rp, aimed at community stuff instead of having to chase heists all day. Like a beat cop rank.
[4:01:23] pthekid: Shakespearean mode
[4:01:31] Deakula: spbMUL That's a James move
[4:01:46] Blaze_sontagami: Cornwood wanted the sheriff office open again
[4:01:51] itisTeddy: @laikainmydreams the old bcso
[4:01:53] williamr754: what is scamba?
[4:01:57] Foreverdead3: @Blaze_sontagami and then just got suspended
[4:01:57] DwightFistmore: will pat come back one day?
[4:02:00] dragonlord07jv: Chat kinda slow today
[4:02:07] goober_pocalypse: Still think the Patrick Downing Security Office needs to get going
[4:02:11] pthekid: @dragonlord07jv Who you callin slow
[4:02:14] qtip126: early but not
[4:02:15] dragonlord07jv: You
[4:02:19] Dbanusa: Does James ever knows where the concert is?
[4:02:20] BillNyeTheSauceGuy: has james ever played a videogame
[4:02:22] JakobCP: think its still just growing pains
[4:02:24] AzmithMiller: Will you ever play Mel again?
[4:02:26] crewvscrew: I feel like PD lacks a character that can create large PD arcs, raises morale when an entire PD feels like a part of something like that imo
[4:02:30] goober_pocalypse: I just want Pat's security company to be called the PDSO LUL
[4:02:31] BitterNine: if they simply let James be the chief we wouldn’t be in this situation
[4:02:32] Blaze_sontagami: @foreverdead3 yeah he wasn’t happy with Den getting gone and then boom :/
[4:02:39] pthekid: Greg Heffley? He has a nice diary
[4:02:49] woolfdesign: @crewvscrew ding ding
[4:02:58] SneakyxOctopus: civ crim is expanding... cop is imploding.
[4:03:13] Cabbagepatchclown_: WICKED
[4:03:14] raz_c0la: Darn racists
[4:03:14] nate2l8: they also made alot of people do academy again like Tony had to make a fresh char and do academy despite being a veteran rper
[4:03:18] BluemoonXIII: Cars are for transport only
[4:03:23] BitterNine: implode and explode. what ever happened to just regular plode
[4:03:27] rouemu: does 4.0 james fug cars
[4:03:31] slider_21: why you guys running
[4:03:33] Foreverdead3: @Blaze_sontagami Prob gonna sound like a cop hating crim viewer but just the PD since 4.0 hasnt seemed good
[4:03:39] slider_21: all this way
[4:03:39] BillNyeTheSauceGuy: @crewvscrew james must fill the role
[4:03:44] Minato_in_Texas: !flip
[4:03:45] Nightbot: Heads
[4:03:45] Foreverdead3: and then they suspend some of the good ones which is just weird
