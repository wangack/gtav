[7:36:49] despicablewebb: rockstar stopped caring about gta5 like 5 years ago LULW
[7:36:54] scotty2thotty18: @mlibby2020 Rockstar develops the game itself.  RedM is just to have private servers that you can mod and RP in.

[7:40:05] badguyzrules: The phrases harry
[7:40:07] plutr0nium: @mlibby2020 your question was confusing because you asked who developed the graphics. Most RP servers don't "develop the graphics"

[13:25:02] Bill_Collector: My used office supply leap was perfect lol, you probably to there and it's a room filled with them and you pick one
[13:25:02] Joeheme: Herman Miller Aeron is fucking amazing i can say from experience
[13:25:28] juicexgx: Harry I got a fitmax gaming chair for $250 it has a leg rest, head rest, and a plug in massager for the lower back. it’s lasted me three years now with no problems. great bang for the buck
[13:25:32] ethameta: i got mine brand new through an office deal. they expect to sell you like 40 of them so the first one is an easy instant 60% off
[13:25:33] Bill_Collector: I prefer the leap over the aeron imo, different flavors. Leap is softer
[13:25:45] Dark_Eyes32: Dark_Eyes32 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! Random, but Luc brought up Don aliases for notes and shit the other day. Any thoughts of an Alia’s for Harry?
