[7:42:49] draxosh: Water Benji. Earth Benji. Fire Benji. Air Benji. Long ago, the four Benjis lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the Fire Benji attacked. Only the B, master of all four elements, could stop them, but when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years passed and my brother and I discovered the airbender named B. And although his airbending skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone. But I believe B can save the world
