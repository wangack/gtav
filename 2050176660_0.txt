[1:51:16] TropicalToucan: KEKW 3.2K
[1:51:32] JohnMowgli: How will the growers get paid? Do they share with the pushers?
[1:51:59] TropicalToucan: People will have to start using the group message app on the HQ app because not everyone has keys to the house
[1:52:02] thepwnographer: thats why everyone has their real jobs
[1:52:06] TropicalToucan: ^
[1:52:16] bobbybedstains: but they also are some of the better getaway drivers

[1:54:19] bobbybedstains: hes been gone and was told weeks ago to FENCE
[1:54:21] RobMeadow: Why not just make civ jobs for yourself and ALL criminal activity towards the crew. Track what everyone brings in and then pay out accordingly
[1:54:23] ld_lucky: Gege will keep in line
[1:54:27] difficultsleep3r: He maybe does an hour a day.
[1:54:32] OmegamonX: did someone make the math how much money harry spent to buy the stuff for fence rep?
[1:54:41] dootadoo: Harry found away to chop nouCheer
[1:54:41] OriginalGibsta: I mean chopping is a ton of steps. You have to chop, take it down to fence, pawn run for dirty cash, wash in the washer and do a cleaning run LUL

[1:55:18] TropicalToucan: @OriginalGibsta He doesnt have to do all the parts at once. He can just chop and do fence. Chop and fence.
[1:55:19] Yetiee: Tony has a "son" that takes up his time too
[1:55:21] legendhasit24: @originalgibsta that is what is crazy!

[1:56:27] Rool_Gonzalez: what I liked about 3.0,that everypone had their own line with trading card for Own stuff in Storage
[1:56:46] bobbybedstains: @Tuccbag would solve and make shit easier
[1:56:56] legendhasit24: who took all those g6 bags down?
[1:56:57] its_ajc: lockers? they have their own apartments KEKW
[1:57:18] digital_prince: 50/50 until they hit partner plus level, then 70/30 but only if they can contribute 300 rep points per month for 3 months
[1:57:19] watermelontoboggan: I don't think Tony grasps that there 1 million in assets in the house he is going reap the rewards of

[1:57:48] Stuckness: Sucks to be a grower in this situation too since no locals are handing you money
[1:58:12] TropicalToucan: Tony just hates Frank
[1:58:17] bobbybedstains: as in put a set amount in theose said lockers for tony and octo to clean see how it goes
[1:58:34] ld_lucky: Tony doesn’t do paperwork
[1:58:41] OmegamonX: how would that be split between grower and seller
[1:58:51] EyeScraem: tony didn't work for anything in 3.0 just took loans and never paid them back
[1:58:52] EyeScraem: LUL
[1:59:00] EyeScraem: also got forgiven on all loans
[1:59:02] bobbybedstains: lockers dont need paper

[2:00:29] Badd_Boi: LUL lang is literally describing a pyramid scheme
[2:00:37] ImKBAR: Build the pyramid one block by one
[2:00:37] il_capitano91: what it sounds like its only tony that has a problem

[2:00:55] chazzatron__: NOTED
[2:00:57] difficultsleep3r: Tony is already running a ponzi scheme. This is too funny
[2:01:13] zap_rowsdower_42: this is all great, but who is going to keep track of all of this
[2:01:25] legendhasit24: having this conversation without Tony is kind of crazy
[2:01:26] Nightbot: If you have Amazon Prime you can sub to Harry for FREE, just go to https://twitch.amazon.com/prime activate it, come back and subscribe free of charge.
[2:01:27] stpotato9: I think Gigi has a system
[2:01:31] Niktory: the communication within this crew has been so amazing i love it , they are so organized and thought out
[2:01:48] PsychoSheepp: illegal is crew, legal is yours
[2:01:48] EyeScraem: idk it seems like the way things are works
[2:01:51] EyeScraem: tony is just lazy LUL
[2:01:58] emiz0r: ^
[2:02:00] aldrichsea: Yall need a logistics person for this system and it needs to be from one person lol
[2:02:00] MADxBACKWARDS: No way
[2:02:04] washed_up_wapiti: if the person’ earnings is only from criminal sruff?
[2:02:07] mike9904_: LUL figuring out how to actually launder money right now
[2:02:22] Niktory: keep dues , dons track money earned , 25-50% kickback
[2:02:25] Tasty_Pixel: Yup
[2:02:26] me_kNight_: You definitely need a Google doc or something with the whole process of how this money stuff works cause it will definitely get confusing if everything is based of a verbal promise for some people, maybe he just does not understand it when you guys tell him he needs it on a PowerPoint
[2:02:33] Sicario_: Gege was tasked with creating a whole system and solving this and Lang is just cooking up random ideas LUL
[2:02:35] KrisCat: @waahedupwapiti that's why they all agreed from the beginning that they would have a legal job...
[2:02:41] pecannepie: thats so complicated
[2:02:42] bruHoran: @me_kNight_ Gege is working on it I think
[2:02:45] Jakieran: Thats more complicated
[2:02:47] joesrx: how much is the chopping gadget and has tony been paying out of his own pocket for it or taking from main stash?
[2:02:48] MADxBACKWARDS: I think the system now is fine until the crew gets big enough then just do percentage splits or do this conversation then
[2:02:48] DominoEFXTV: Gigi save us
[2:02:51] pokerfacezz: why change whole system for one guy?
[2:02:51] bobbybedstains: LuL
[2:02:58] pecannepie: gigi help them lol
[2:03:00] OmegamonX: @pokerfacezz good question
[2:03:02] Jakieran: Its not hard to just earn 5 or 10k
[2:03:05] dagonr11: how would that work if someone grows the weed and someone else sells it
[2:03:06] dootadoo: Keep dues and raise them as the economy gets better. 10k to 11k
[2:03:07] Tuccbag: Keep track of what you bring in and then you get a specific percentage back based on your position in the crew
[2:03:08] quassaarr: if u have minimum, people will do minimum
[2:03:12] zRikyy96: what about people like gigi that are more or less clean
[2:03:12] bobbybedstains: yea just do more
[2:03:13] TropicalToucan: my personal opinion splitting his time on 3 characters, Tony, AJ, and now recently Copleone is going to burn him out because He is going to do 18 hour Grime sessions.
[2:03:13] Gratitude: im lost on how the grower and cleaner bring money in
[2:03:16] franciscooo25: But what about the growers?
[2:03:17] Yosamita: the more you use the house the more you end up paying
[2:03:17] Stuckness: RIP growers
[2:03:18] bruHoran: @pokerfacezz the system is not great tbf
[2:03:21] Shottgunner: Wasn't this working, just Tony isn't paying?
[2:03:28] emiz0r: the system works for everyone, but tony LuL
[2:03:28] il_capitano91: that will be less money to the crew
[2:03:29] EyeScraem: 10k dirty per week is a tony considering how little you guys have actually had dirty so far
[2:03:40] EyeScraem: is a lot*
[2:03:46] chazzatron__: @zRikyy96 she can buy dirt rolls from the dirty guys i guess
[2:03:51] legendhasit24: this isn’t even about the weekly buy in. how did we get there?
[2:03:51] iiidaaah: But the grower don't generate any money. Unless it's counted twice or thrice
[2:03:52] SwaxwellSilver: let’s make it even more complicated lol
[2:03:54] jasongembright: In the real mafia you pay up to your direct supervisor. The more you pay up the more clout you have
[2:03:55] URABadMonkey: So everyone has to clean their own money?
[2:03:56] MADxBACKWARDS: your losing money then no? it just the crim things bringing money in
[2:03:58] bruHoran: This is the convo y'all should deffo had with Gege LUL
[2:04:01] Sablotron: overcomplicated, meh
[2:04:07] dagonr11: and what money do frowers generate?
[2:04:08] bobbybedstains: i mean tony did clean like 15k the past couple days
[2:04:09] emiz0r: NotLikeThis
[2:04:10] odd_frost: If you can only clean your own dirty stuff then isn't it just giving 10k clean easier
[2:04:10] nahoopii: It was simple and it didn't work. Now it's complicated.
[2:04:10] morulanvr: thats way too complicated
[2:04:11] civlaz: LUL
[2:04:13] aldrichsea: too much brainstorming lol
[2:04:16] me_kNight_: @bruhoran good to know hope it's ready fast before it goes sour between the guys
[2:04:20] hippiehs: they are overcooking this so much LUL
[2:04:21] bygoneflygon: overcooking
[2:04:21] Im_Bennn: Seems like a much more complicated system KEKW
[2:04:22] reichenbachs: but cleaners wont get money... ?
[2:04:23] Yosamita: yeah wayy to complicated lol
[2:04:25] emiz0r: lost in the sauce
[2:04:25] khumaini710: i think just keep old system..need tony to step up and not scammaz and motivated
[2:04:26] il_capitano91: the system you had now is much better
[2:04:26] MADxBACKWARDS: yeah thats way to complicated
[2:04:27] badbrainsss: cooked
[2:04:29] dootadoo: @bruHoran Gigi is not made yet
[2:04:29] Yosamita: but yeah i like the idea
[2:04:29] pokerfacezz: overcomplicating system for no reason.
[2:04:30] rhythmkiller: bruh this is too complicated
[2:04:31] mike9904_: harrNODDERS
[2:04:32] r6_ai: Some of the jobs don't generate money directly. Weed Growers, money cleaners
[2:04:32] EyeScraem: way too complicated easy is better NODDERS
[2:04:36] LazyMike: NotLikeThis
[2:04:37] DominoEFXTV: We need da general geegaSalute
[2:04:41] legendhasit24: change nothing, track what do you. easy
[2:04:41] tsebaka: How is this a good idea? White money earned much faster then  that dirty cash, no? It will give people a good reason to buy dirty rolls
[2:04:42] eckotips42: geegaPien
[2:04:44] finsane1: 20k dirty pays the dues. every more is yours
[2:04:44] bruHoran: @me_kNight_ yeah.. I hope so
[2:04:45] giacobbogiacobbi: 10k a week is so easy, why overthink the situation?
[2:04:53] bobbybedstains: nobdy keeps tracj
[2:04:54] TropicalToucan: No way Arush is doing any of this as the treasurer. Where is Gigi LUL
[2:04:55] difficultsleep3r: Tony stealing the groups G6 money was prime comedy. It has to be intentional. No one can be that dumb.
[2:04:57] reichenbachs: no one would clean money
[2:04:59] OmegamonX: this is such a slippery slope that will lead to percentage contribution towards dirty money based on who did what and how it was generated. f.e weed selling
[2:05:01] IrSleepii: changing the whole system just for tony KEKW
[2:05:01] bobbybedstains: nobody keeps track
[2:05:03] Aledz_: I imagine the Julia Roberts meme with the formulas and math here
[2:05:07] NoQox: just keep track and pay your dues easy
[2:05:11] IvyOlive: the only thing that sucks is that the growers don’t generate money
[2:05:12] MADxBACKWARDS: but he can bnring in clean cash he just doesnt
[2:05:16] Cambymamby: what about getting paid for growing
[2:05:19] Cambymamby: just time wasted?
[2:05:20] yuziphantom: FeelsDankMan
[2:05:24] civlaz: yea true
[2:05:28] bobbybedstains: tony does 5k money runs as much as he can
[2:05:29] giacobbogiacobbi: No shot yuno keeps track to how much he earns and spends LUL
[2:05:30] EyeScraem: wasn't the clean front important?
[2:05:30] BaldScooter: So does arush get a percent of dirty money then octo get a percentage of that same money because he cleans it?
[2:05:31] dagonr11: how would the growers bring in the dirty cash?
[2:05:33] bygoneflygon: because you're growing the weed
[2:05:38] The_St33d: Feels bad for the grower
[2:05:45] MADxBACKWARDS: but then he doesnt get a kickback no?
[2:05:48] OmegamonX: OMEGALUL what about before
[2:05:53] Cambymamby: growers get shafted?
[2:05:59] finsane1: it’s his
[2:06:00] nahoopii: The seller is selling the growers stuff.
[2:06:00] SwaxwellSilver: @the_st33d this what do they get?
[2:06:03] Stuckness: I guess you just decide on a value for each plant
[2:06:04] KrisCat: so it should be more about how much work everyone is doing for the group and not necessarily how much money they bring in
[2:06:17] Jess17: their using your product to pay the dues.
[2:06:17] IvyOlive: rip the growers
[2:06:18] Daemon_Hood: Growers get no value unless it's taken into account in the system somehow
[2:06:21] The_St33d: @SwaxwellSilver roleplay :)
[2:06:23] brianm513: 2024 Cumstacking
[2:06:24] Sablotron: it's missing the part of "where" do they get that dirty from. It doesn't come from thin air, someone had to put clean money down to generate that dirty at the end.
[2:06:27] iiidaaah: @nahoopii and cleaner is cleaning the sellers stuff. So who's money is it LULW
[2:06:31] Jingus20: what about people who clean do they just not get cut in?
[2:06:33] SwaxwellSilver: lmao
[2:06:38] TropicalToucan: Arush LUL
[2:06:43] morulanvr: that shit is cooked
[2:06:46] bobbybedstains: also whos taking money from the stacsk
[2:06:49] reichenbachs: what about people who clean money tho
[2:06:53] nahoopii: @iiidaaah exactly
[2:06:57] cochorus: cant there be an issue of double accounting. for example brings in dirty cash. but then someone counting them cleaning the dirty case as a "job"
[2:06:59] yaPPer808: but what about growing the weed
[2:07:02] alex61043: what about the growers?
[2:07:08] franciscooo25: is not the same as the dirty requires to pay for everyone in the process of getting and cleaning
[2:07:09] OmegamonX: this makes no sense
[2:07:19] reichenbachs: WAYTOODANK
[2:07:27] seniorbunss: Should be more because dirty is more of a process
[2:07:31] MADxBACKWARDS: tony has no way to get 10K in dirty cash though, he wont work the fence like that and he doesnt sell weed
[2:07:32] bobbybedstains: this is a circle jerk going not far
[2:07:39] ironzackpt: grower - dryer - seller - cleaner
[2:07:41] EvilDeadHead_: Dons got one guy'd
[2:07:42] Cressiduhhhhh: x percent of all the money gets kept by the group ez clap
[2:07:44] gadget_t: The kickback doesn't make sense, you just owe a % of your earnings to the crew
[2:07:47] mike9904_: harrNom
[2:07:48] il_capitano91: that is less money for the crew because now you have clean and dirty money to the crew
[2:07:54] Gratitude: If selling weed counts, aren't the crew losing money? That weed is already going to be sold.. This is so cooked
[2:07:54] tz223: The complication is the money coming in is touched by multiple people, so $1 can be claimed by three people
[2:07:55] reichenbachs: shouldnt tony be here
[2:07:57] izzygus333: so what happens with the growers
[2:08:00] Cambymamby: this sounds like a bad idea lol
[2:08:03] martymagoo78: but then… growing weed actually brings in no money… only the seller does, so how do you value that?
[2:08:04] zRikyy96: yeah there are roles who don't get money directly, but there are still needed, like grower, cleaner, soldier, enforcer
[2:08:07] MADxBACKWARDS: Yeah this just seems like extra steps for less money
[2:08:16] OriginalGibsta: weed is grow, push, clean so 33% per step? those gotta be valued
[2:08:16] legendhasit24: I think where it gets complicated is the cleaners
[2:08:21] xprnstr_twitch: langs system is more for the future
[2:08:22] mCerti: Should be a 50% cut on everything above the dues. Like a tax bracket
[2:08:40] bobbybedstains: just keep track of the damn money
[2:08:46] aldrichsea: that sounds like what Gigi was planning
[2:08:48] bobbybedstains: if you cant then get a finme
[2:08:53] xy02x: so what's the value of someone selling cypto coin
[2:09:10] dootadoo: Maybe everybody in house gets their own safe too. like a locker or something. and it would solidify Team Cypress
[2:09:36] djerbis: the problem iwth that is if like someone gets caught and looses like 200 bags, or someone gets robbed
[2:09:54] bobbybedstains: cleaner fees
[2:09:55] turbodyrock: Chatting yo hers my opinion
[2:10:02] Yosamita: lol
[2:10:03] Nywro: How much is your time getting circuit board mats for tech folks to flip it.
[2:10:04] mike9904_: LUL
[2:10:05] OmegamonX: exchange rate for dirty cash needs to be established lets buy swaps later
[2:10:13] OriginalGibsta: power bill costs too? this is harrCooked2
[2:10:25] stpotato9: this took forever
[2:10:28] dagonr11: that is crazy complicated
[2:10:28] legendhasit24: first we need to figure out a tracking system, that’s the biggest thing
[2:10:37] cliffscorner: New name for the group: SpreadSheet Bois
[2:10:41] tz223: KEKW underlying thing is everyone still needs to keep track

[12:10:27] nphect_: u have the right to do it honestly. u been grinding so much
[12:10:29] reichenbachs: luciano tbh
[12:10:30] yellowtristan: @yushers agreed or octo
[12:10:31] nick_richard22: woah
[12:10:31] arteries_: tony at this moment is just a worse October in terms of usefullness
[12:10:33] GlitchyByte: i think tony wants more theater rp situations, but the city right now is very grindy and it's taking its toll on him
[12:10:34] shiifon: Has to be Luci cause Lang doesnt want to do it aswell KEKW
[12:10:34] coldeveryday: @KinGhidorah yeah that's their plan
[12:10:35] retrenity: gigi
[12:10:36] Eku007: Arush can be a bit strict too when he's in mood
[12:10:36] sleepyeles: Pog whoa
[12:10:40] eazypzz: all the conflicts at the end of 3.0 were blamed on Harry and not lang
[12:10:41] BlacKnight2514: check apps
[12:10:46] Yushers: @yellowtristan, octo cant bring that up to a don, bad precident
[12:10:47] coldeveryday: @shiifon but luc is too nice to tony LUL
[12:10:51] ryedbread: !bsg
[12:10:51] Nightbot: Please don't backseat. Harry will make decisions as he sees fit! RPDirector NOP
[12:11:02] Drmarshmelluw: @shiifon nah luci sugar codes it to much
[12:11:07] buuutty: any hope to see lil kev soon?
[12:11:08] currykeiki: !song
[12:11:08] nphect_: new walls
[12:11:09] Nightbot: The Current Song is I'm Not A Player by Big Punisher
[12:11:16] Yushers: @Drmarshmelluw, its sugar coats
[12:11:18] Mixcy9: @yellowtristan why would a non don bring that up?
[12:11:29] DEagleEye: @coldeveryday nah luc is fair to tony cause he tries to see both sides
[12:11:39] RivenSenpaii: arush doing it will be glorious
[12:11:40] Drmarshmelluw: @Yushers i was in-between both honestly
[12:11:41] ProngsAedan: Its also everyone needs to talk and not just Lang. Because if Harry talked and explained how he has never pocketed money from doing illegal stuff and only does that for rep and betterment of the crew. Tony will get it. He probably thinks everyone is doing their own thing and getting a cut?
[12:11:58] kuaci1: what happened with clem earlier
[12:11:59] coldeveryday: @DEagleEye true, but doesnt he do it too often, he never likes to take any sides
[12:12:07] yellowtristan: @yushers true but may be the only way, Tony looks at octo like a don, and if every din can’t make it make sense it may be the last option.
[12:12:08] pnwgreg: Gotta be honest the skin colored ran mask scares me a bit
[12:12:13] pnwgreg: Rat
[12:12:15] DEagleEye: @prongsaedan nah he dsnt think anything he just floated an idea and its been blown waaaaay out of proportion
[12:12:16] BoatMagee: I think every crew has had this issue in 4.0
[12:12:16] tz223: 4.0 and 3.0 are way different and I think Tony just hasn't woken up to that yet
[12:12:16] Drmarshmelluw: luci is a fence sitter lol
[12:12:16] jedimindtricks82k: harryRAT welcome Lord Harrington harryRAT
[12:12:19] coldeveryday: just gotta respect hierarchy
[12:12:22] the_brandolorian: what did tony do exactly?
[12:12:22] Eku007: harrRat
[12:12:29] Yushers: @yellowtristan, tony doesn't look to octo as a don, he just wants him to be one. difference there
[12:12:32] mokoto05: yap
[12:12:35] NoTaGain15151: how many now 15?
[12:12:35] bigchimpo: yeah some of these problems are being discovered by Corleone not created
[12:12:37] coldeveryday: YEP
[12:12:39] nphect_: yeah but atleast the dons have to be all in the same page
[12:12:41] lunorx6: yep
[12:12:42] reichenbachs: YEP
[12:12:44] Jjiano: @the_brandolorian thats the thing. Tony barely does anything
[12:12:44] DEagleEye: @coldeveryday i mean thats his character, its rp bro
[12:12:49] Mixcy9: @yellowtristan Octo himself said that he don't want to be a don
[12:12:56] retrenity: NODDERS
[12:12:57] seniorbunss: NODDERS
[12:12:57] BlacKnight2514: thats why you need meetings with everyone and not just the dons, to many only don meetins
[12:13:01] Yushers: @yellowtristan, can't have a non-don have that convo with a don. Ruins the whole structure
[12:13:02] The_Northern_Monkey: you can leave notes on the pc though, could help for missed meetings
[12:13:04] MustBeTheGreatest: casually 15-20 people all trying to stay in sync
[12:13:06] broxx1: @yellowtristan Octo can't be don or they would need to bring another 7th don for the tiebreaker
[12:13:10] coldeveryday: @DEagleEye i know, im saying that's what the char does
[12:13:22] yellowtristan: @yushers there really isn’t a set structure
[12:13:22] jenniferoz1: that’s why they have meetings every Fridays
[12:13:29] BlacKnight2514: aint that deep and serious also at the end of the day
[12:13:34] misfit_justice: yea honestly, I hope PD gets things sorted sooner rather than later
[12:13:41] Yushers: @yellowtristan, the only structure is that there are 5 dons above everyone else. break that, break the whole system
[12:13:43] NoTaGain15151: @broxx1 I m pretty sure octo doesnt want to be a don
[12:13:44] HoronXI: i think 7th don a bit too much, 5 is a good number
[12:13:46] coldeveryday: @misfit_justice cops need a major buff
[12:13:46] DEagleEye: @jjiano thats just false he chopped solo for 3 hours while cleaning money and doing jewellery runs and solo running stuff to the sewers last night cause arush and marty didnt want to help (nobody else was around)
[12:13:49] No_Sneezing: NODDERS
[12:13:54] lunorx6: yep its gonna take time
[12:14:01] jenniferoz1: this song DinoDance
[12:14:09] Firepokachu: i mean if you look at redline's history most of that crew viewed octo a bit higher than tony
[12:14:13] broxx1: @broxx1 yeah he never has shown interest in RP
[12:14:14] Yushers: @yellowtristan, kinda like whats happening with PD, there are 3 captains and those under the captains are questioning one captain. If the other two captains put weight to that, it all comes crumbling down
[12:14:16] Firepokachu: despite being joint leaders
[12:14:17] simplysavvy793: I think once Gigi presents the structure for finances a lot of confusion will be solved
[12:14:21] dronthego: lebronJAM
[12:14:22] lunorx6: how was your day harry
[12:14:33] buuutty: even though there are 5 dons it still seems like llang is the leader with the way he talks to everyone
[12:14:33] davelavio: welp
[12:14:34] jedimindtricks82k: harryRAT + ⭐ harryRAT
[12:14:35] Teddsan: jesus
[12:14:36] Bdog75: it’s just going to take time hopefully but it’s not to bad. when you do this for a living tho it could suck
[12:14:36] bigchimpo: LUL
[12:14:40] ishouldprobably: its damn near impossible to hold people accountable when there isn't a real SOP to follow and it's rewritten in half full meetings everyday. so leeway is afforded
[12:14:46] vrYasu: still 1 every 5 seconds
[12:14:49] vrYasu: Sadge
[12:14:52] ProngsAedan: ProngsAedan subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! In an alternate world your guy's crew can run the PD. Like the structure and progress is so impressive.
[12:14:54] coldeveryday: does separating into multiple slots not help? prob been asked
[12:14:57] Yushers: @buuutty, he keeps pushing for other dons to speak up tho so its a process
[12:15:01] Nickknows: avon Madge
[12:15:01] bigchimpo: buddhaMonka
[12:15:01] illestLUL: monkaW
[12:15:02] misfit_justice: does splitting not help with the conversion?
[12:15:04] lunorx6: LUL
[12:15:06] DEagleEye: @coldeveryday they fixed that
[12:15:08] lumimosh: @DEagleEye that's one day when they other guys have been working like that every day since day one
[12:15:09] vosje91: Damn Clem must have been here a long time since she is immune
[12:15:10] dronthego: monkaS
[12:15:14] lifeguard4lyfe: Tony should run an underground racing and chopping ring with octo
[12:15:16] bigchimpo: COPIUM
[12:15:17] jshwan: @buuutty maybe a reason why he wants people to step up so its more even
[12:15:20] coldeveryday: OMEGADANCE
[12:15:25] exo__23: we bouta start getting his TTS
[12:15:31] KinGhidorah: i find it interesting that this npc is different than what Dundee sees
[12:15:40] DEagleEye: @lumimosh its not 1 day though hes doing stuff every days, what do u think hes doing on the server twiddling his thumbs LUL
[12:15:42] BlacKnight2514: need more crime and tony wil be back at it, especiallly shit with cars adn racing
[12:15:45] jenniferoz1: that’s why there are 5 dons, so there isn’t one leader.
[12:15:45] simplysavvy793: @firepokachu that’s partially because Tony always had to be the bad guy during situations because Octo never stepped up in conflict
[12:15:47] apache78: Gotta find a TI-84 for Antoine lol
[12:15:48] ErraticSwami: @KinGhidorah he has like 4 of them
[12:15:51] misfit_justice: it's weird, cause splitting works so well and smoothly for the hunting items
[12:15:56] coldeveryday: harrNODDERS harrNODDERS harrNODDERS
[12:16:04] dqwiuhejkw1qhenjklw1qn: NO
[12:16:08] tz223: Just do drug production stuff
[12:16:10] ishouldprobably: good at delegation
[12:16:11] coldeveryday: @misfit_justice yeah that's what i was thinking
[12:16:12] yellowtristan: @yushers I get what you’re saying, but if I had to guess Tony’s perspective, he holds octos word to the same weight as the other dons, so if he were to tell him he’s wrong it may hold a different weight, being his best friend. just my opinion though.
[12:16:13] Praxism: gaffa
[12:16:14] Jjiano: @DEagleEye yea tony does some things. but if you equate him to other dons, he does barely anything
[12:16:17] eazypzz: Harry the gaffa
[12:16:20] evil__hag: lebronJAM
[12:16:21] coldeveryday: the gaffa
[12:16:22] KinGhidorah: @KinGhidorah ohh ok
[12:16:22] its_ajc: i think just having a don handle a department will help sort things out
[12:16:23] MindlessMannequin: i remember when you were bane LUL
[12:16:25] decrepit_monster: Mid management
[12:16:25] Eku007: @dqwiuhejkw1qhenjklw1qn FirstTimeChadder
[12:16:27] RivenSenpaii: middle management brown
[12:16:28] arcanejr: make a crew under dons
[12:16:33] pnwgreg: Are you like Brown irl?
[12:16:35] AloofMango: FirstTimeChadder
[12:16:38] temespeti: good at recruiting too
[12:16:38] jshwan: rat boss RatgeLurk
[12:16:45] jenniferoz1: that’s the point of dons no?
[12:16:48] Yushers: @yellowtristan, totally fine for octo to say that to him but as a message from the crew, it has to come from the dons
[12:16:51] Hyperion57: FirstTimeChadder no
[12:16:54] ProngsAedan: 100% Roosters Reef existed and thrived because of Brown
[12:16:55] Eku007: AloofMango harrWave sup
[12:16:55] MustBeTheGreatest: browns the best recruiter in np dont argue w me lol
[12:16:57] luscinii: voices like you are needed in a group Harry, or else it will be another yes man company situation again
[12:16:58] joshiek_: @jjiano just because he doesn’t do weed doesn’t mean he doesn’t do anything
[12:16:59] Fugeki: I don’t see a boss all I see is a harrRat harrRat harrRat harrRat
[12:17:00] DEagleEye: @jjiano they have that opportunity via sani though, grime leads nowhere neither does chopping or fence (yet)
[12:17:03] eazypzz: plz no more hard vouches
[12:17:04] lumimosh: @DEagleEye getting his funny up
[12:17:11] reichenbachs: Octo can't be under Tony's supervision since they both lead a crew imo
[12:17:15] jenniferoz1: 5 votes 3-2 right
[12:17:17] reichenbachs: In 3.0
[12:17:21] Mixcy9: @lifeguard4lyfe Octavio hate chopping , he do it because it was asked from him
[12:17:24] Jjiano: @DEagleEye not that there's anything wrong with it tho. he can do what he wants. the whining/super defensive thing is just it
[12:17:32] Dythronix: BOOMIES
[12:17:34] MrFNZero: Can someone give this guy a calculator already
[12:17:36] AloofMango: @Eku007 peepoHey  sntSwoon
[12:17:37] coldeveryday: @reichenbachs they want to leave most of 3.0 history behind
[12:17:39] Yushers: @reichenbachs, 3.0 is dead and gone for all these characters at least
[12:17:44] Bdog75: HUH every time I’ve tuned into Anthony’s stream he’s in a pounder
[12:17:44] yellowtristan: @yushers yeah I agree. we just know, as it’s a meme, that comms are notoriously bad amongst the dons KEKW

[12:18:21] fublian: Did we end up not having any power bill?
[12:18:22] HighToker: large weed rack soon
[12:18:26] coldeveryday: @Danthemann24 real
[12:18:28] DEagleEye: @jjiano well, firstly is rp in character so it is what it is, secondly when arush says he "caught tony swapping " cause he floated the IDEA of it, ofc he gets defensive hes getting accused of something he didnt do
[12:18:28] Jjiano: @joshiek_ i never said anything about weed. im talking purely in terms of effort the other dons are doing. literally busting their asses off.
[12:18:48] jokerj17: they need a suit or something so u don’t take damage
[12:18:49] tripletuner: holy essay chat RP WutFace
[12:18:57] MustBeTheGreatest: @Atomicpredator avon lang speedy etc are adjusted in ame peds, before they created their peds they used the in game ones
[12:18:58] Yushers: tbf there's no one to replace tony so its better to work out the issue
[12:19:00] magnetstrolldespair: where is he going OMEGADANCE

[12:19:35] magnetstrolldespair: Damn Frank turning Gangster
[12:19:35] reichenbachs: @coldeveryday more like tony sees octo as his equal because they're best friends etc
[12:19:35] pnwgreg: Facts
[12:19:37] SEINA6: true
[12:19:40] coldeveryday: would be good for content
[12:19:40] RevolverBoss: Yes
[12:19:41] lightstormclaw: @DEagleEye okay but if tony wants to swap or whatever why not just get washers in his own apartment and not bring it to the group house where everything is there for the betterment of the group
[12:19:47] Yushers: anthonyz wont take it personal nor will anyone else
[12:19:49] RFA__Triple: Let’s be real, Tony isn’t on near as much as everyone else and he had a week in NY and He likes to RP different and it just isn’t in the form of grinding. Not that it’s right or wrong, just how he is. I love his RP but he does need to grind a little more for the rise.
[12:19:49] temespeti: bring the spice

[12:20:12] shiifon: yeah kinda surprise Brown is the least hot headed out of the 5 dons
[12:20:18] MustBeTheGreatest: the occasional wall harry
[12:20:18] fenixblac: Hard Nosed Unhinged Harry BrownEye!!!
[12:20:22] Jjiano: @DEagleEye oh i aint talking about swapping or any of that brother. to me its just work ethic as a don. which is honestly nigh irrelevant to what he wants to do as a streamer
[12:20:25] DEagleEye: @lightstormclaw right but if the group decides thats not how they want it to work why wld he do that, thats why you float the idea and have a discussion about it
[12:20:31] nosebeersx: Chatting
[12:20:32] MustBeTheGreatest: hadnt seen the wall in ahile till the mickey meeting
[12:20:35] redemption2094: @deagleeye you are defending tony so much but the man doesn't love any jobs, no commitment. And it doesn't help that he took 2 vacation already. The dons just want him to step up.
[12:20:47] lightstormclaw: @RFA__Triple can still make money with out mindless grinding by hustling which he doesnt do either
[12:20:49] hypnomaze: @reichenbachs its not just that, he sees octo's potential and the group is starting to seeing it too, tony has way more experience tho
