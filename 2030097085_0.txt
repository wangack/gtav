[6:43:35] Jako9999: We are always annoying :)
[6:43:36] Broosh: Lenny isn't in copium, I just think the character of Gary would definitely go with Lenny.  But I think Graycen has a certain idea for his arc in mind, but Gary isn't strong enough to stand up to the Vagos yet lol.
[6:43:56] Spazzytuna: yeah it is an interesting storyline for sure

[6:46:04] ernestjevs: vagos not keeped word why they want everyone else will keep
[6:46:13] SynistorTV: its not sucking dick though. think of it more as manipulation. outsmart them in the short term and keep grinding/growing and make them pay long term.

Colleges tend to be smaller and focus on a specialized field of study. Class sizes and student populations are typically smaller than at a university.
