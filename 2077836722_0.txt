[3:45:15] Senna_Minxy: Closest I've seen to bagged milk in the US is when I put the Milk carton in the plastic bag after I buy it
[3:45:17] Oh_no_melon: Bagged milk is better... Rather than constantly opening a gallon, you have it split into 3 bags... It lasts longer
[3:45:35] Thallo_Auxo: @ratmcfink mine never did...? I liked them but I prefer bottles for recycling
[3:45:40] DrJonez: so when you drink all the milk then you use the straw to blow up the bag, then when it's full of air you stab the straw the rest of the way through to seal it... so then you take the bag full of air, press a dent into the plastic, then squeeze the bag to force all the air into the dent and it would pop loud enough to scare the whole lunch room KEKW
