[0:09:57] k1llab33z: Yooooooo
[0:10:05] chatty_patty93: Once u find the number associated with gta, then you'll find the gta.exe
[0:10:06] LoboYue: you need that in order for fivem to work because it needs to verify you have a legit copy you paid for
[0:10:06] cymetry: You need Rockstar bro
[0:10:23] LoboYue: yes
[0:10:45] k1llab33z: Noko RP oh god the fk9ng content thats about to un veil
[0:10:45] LoboYue: im wondering what info you gave to be whitelisted because it seems like they whitelisted a random person
[0:10:47] LoboYue: LUL
[0:10:53] chatty_patty93: Be a jerk
[0:10:56] ciaruhh_: just do your voice....
[0:11:02] Orchie: Tony Soprano
[0:11:03] zor0_139: do you know which server your joining?

[0:11:10] k1llab33z: Nah Australian
[0:11:12] Cashx: Do a sqeeky voice lol
[0:11:16] ciaruhh_: trueeeee
[0:11:17] Nayib13x: can you sound like fuse?
[0:11:17] friendan1: the country/southern accent would be funny too
[0:11:25] SharkTemplar: What section of England?
[0:11:29] surgical_scope00: Use an accent you can keep with minimal effort then as things progress you may need to use different voices
[0:11:37] cymetry: Depends on your RP honestly whatever fits your character
[0:11:41] SharkTemplar: Like, low-class cockney, upper crust?
[0:11:43] chatty_patty93: New rpers over think it
[0:11:47] SharkTemplar: Birmingham?
[0:11:48] zor0_139: Boston accent
[0:11:54] SharkTemplar: We need Shauna here
[0:11:56] chatty_patty93: The more natural you are the better
[0:12:02] LoboYue: tbh even if you had this situated the tsunami is in like 2 hours either way
[0:12:03] Deschit: RUDE
[0:12:08] friendan1: go full peaky blinders
[0:12:13] SharkTemplar: So rude!
[0:12:23] chatty_patty93: It's going to be hard to keep up a drastically different persona
[0:12:33] LoboYue: how were you whitelisted with no rockstar or fivem account @Noko
[0:12:34] SharkTemplar: Talk like Ozzy Osbourne the whole time.
[0:12:42] k1llab33z: Yeah @noko if someone ask you what part of england are you from so we need to do some research @noko
[0:13:06] StreamElements: Hey chat did you know that unlike on twitch you can subscribe to Noko's YouTube channel completely for free youtube.com/channel/UCE1bMN7FSCRO6BHFHnAl0JQ
[0:13:35] surgical_scope00: Drunk accent?
[0:13:36] LoboYue: please no accent
[0:13:39] SharkTemplar: England has soooooo many regional accents.
[0:13:40] surgical_scope00: Wtf is that
[0:13:40] chatty_patty93: An English drunk?
[0:13:48] SharkTemplar: He still sounds like that.
[0:13:55] SharkTemplar: Take it from your local metalhead.
[0:14:01] LoboYue: you will end up hating yourself if you have to use the same accent for hours
[0:14:08] marty3763: sharonnnnnn
[0:14:16] strategicruin: Do a cockney accent
[0:14:19] Cashx: Dam, you were spot on
[0:14:35] SharkTemplar: That was quite good, TBH.
[0:14:43] Psykomantis86: jamaican
[0:14:48] luminet_gaming: NAAH NAAH NAAH! no way my boy is playing GTA 5!  i am literally halfway through the story mode. playing it for the first time.. 10 years after the release
[0:14:57] chatty_patty93: @loboyue I agree, I think new rpers overthink it... Acie named herself Vee jj...
[0:15:14] LoboYue: @chatty_patty93 ngl i love each time someone asks for her first and last name
[0:15:16] LoboYue: LUL
[0:15:34] ReFLexX_ii: Oh I can't wait to watch this. Feel yourself as a character that your gonna love using non stop but also do all the bank heists!!!
[0:15:36] Deschit: do streamers have to do quarterly taxes or only yearly?
[0:15:58] SharkTemplar: $450 per month??? Holy shit, how fucked up are your finances? I pay that much once a year for my taxes to be filed.
[0:16:02] chatty_patty93: @loboyue but I don't think their laughing with her... their laughing at her, maybe I'm wrong
[0:16:07] zor0_139: oh nah
[0:16:16] strategicruin: SCAMMED!
[0:16:18] Deschit: HUH
[0:16:21] Nayib13x: uhhh
[0:16:26] Cashx: 450 a month? gaddam
[0:16:40] surgical_scope00: I'll do it for 300 a month  Kappa
[0:16:47] SharkTemplar: @Deschit As independent contractors, I would assume quarterly.
[0:16:53] geefunk01: That's their fee?
[0:17:10] Deschit: @SharkTemplar that's what I thought
[0:17:30] SharkTemplar: @Deschit I work for myself, so I know a little about that, at least.
[0:17:48] VinnycentLive: use the same CPA as Wigg
[0:17:59] MikeyDunkz: I came here cus I heard you were struggling in FiveM LMAO
[0:18:06] StreamElements: Watch Noko's latest YouTube video: The future of my channel - https://youtu.be/wLrVSfiXdTk
[0:18:12] SharkTemplar: $5,400/year for accounting? Jesus, my dude, you must be rolling in it! nokoHype nokoHype
[0:18:23] zor0_139: the taxes life outside a W2 is crazy
[0:18:37] strategicruin: Find a CPA that has done jail time, they will make sure you are covered cause they need to cover their ass
[0:18:56] SharkTemplar: It's not really that hard, @RacketyGnome300, just get your 1099s and pay your quarterlies.
[0:19:03] Orchie: @MikeyDunkz lol
[0:19:06] SharkTemplar: Wow, that feels usurious to me.
[0:19:12] VinnycentLive: Taxes just suck
[0:19:18] Deschit: @SharkTemplar yeah my sister does the same, but and my dad is an accountant and has helped us out for years on filing correctly. I had a feeling streamers were contractors, but was curious what the tax situation is with twitch specfiically
[0:19:20] MikeyDunkz: No, you dont need to enable anything for rockstar/gta you need to just download GTA, get fivem and open fivem. u dont need to do anything in gta
[0:19:24] zor0_139: @SharkTemplar but its expensive... W2 you just use turbo tax
[0:19:27] geefunk01: Stop getting ripped off
[0:19:32] marty3763: and even if they’re going to charge you an additional 2K to file, that just seems excessive. I understand your taxes are more complex than many, but that seems like a lot in relation to what I presume your income is around
[0:19:34] MikeyDunkz: nope
[0:19:37] BigBodyAnt: YO YO you should look into LiquidRP
[0:19:39] BigBodyAnt: great server
[0:19:39] chatty_patty93: H&R block is out of the question?
[0:19:42] LoboYue: not really unless you play storymode
[0:19:58] SharkTemplar: I cannot get my head around them charging you that much, but it may be because of how you earn your money as a streamer?
[0:20:01] VinnycentLive: is there a CPA that only helps a lot of streamers?
[0:20:01] MikeyDunkz: Guys let him experience RP before anything. Hes gonna be hooked ONG
[0:20:13] Cashx: How about Puffs Noko
[0:20:29] KSleazy24: shaftsly swingswell
[0:20:31] MikeyDunkz: Chris remember the first time you play WoW? this is how RP is going to be. GL
[0:20:40] marty3763: @sharktemplar his taxes aren’t nearly as simple as most who input their w2 and any other sources of income
[0:20:49] esmean01: Morning Noko
[0:21:08] Cashx: Do an Islander accent lol
[0:21:13] marty3763: even if you own a small business, if you manage your books  throughout the year it isn’t insanely complex
[0:21:19] geefunk01: Are there any details already available?
[0:21:21] Orchie: Christopher Moltisanti
[0:21:22] MikeyDunkz: Just do a normal voice. itll be easier when ur not feeling it trust me
[0:21:28] LoboYue: ^^^^
[0:21:32] SharkTemplar: I am sure that's true, @marty3763, but it still feels pretty usurious.
[0:21:36] iSleepyk3: gtarp first day hellsyeah!!! so excited luvelyPunch luvelyPunch luvelyPunch
[0:21:45] MikeyDunkz: U AINT EVER RP'D GET EXPERIENCE first llo

[0:21:59] VinnycentLive: challenge accepted
[0:22:11] MikeyDunkz: Ok, give us options
[0:22:13] luminet_gaming: Australian Noko is one to cherish
[0:22:18] zor0_139: I like when streamers do accents cause its easier to tell when they're talking to chat and when they're talking in game
[0:22:18] VinnycentLive: whats your best one
[0:22:25] DarkMetaphor: YUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUR
[0:22:27] MikeyDunkz: Be a NY MOB dude. im with it
[0:22:28] Cashx: Do Thralls voice from WOW
[0:22:29] marty3763: @sharktemplar I agree it does feel excessive to charge 6-8K, but I have no reference
[0:22:30] KSleazy24: can you say I did not have sexual relations with that woman - Bill Clinton accent
[0:22:43] MikeyDunkz: Christopher Moltisanti
