[4:33:49] lxz_ll: I‚Äôm Brazilian and I‚Äôm trying to learn English, I already understand a little, but do you think if I keep watching Lulu I‚Äôll learn a lot by listening to her?
[4:33:58] babelonian16: @Tazzie_T yea i bought a 6" 9/16ths spark plug socket plus i have a 3" socket extender so i don't think its length. but it doesn't feel like its gripping when i try to twist out the spark plug
[4:34:50] JoshuaBR_: @lucas5676l I am brazilian too, and you learn a lot by talking to people. You need to read stuff in english as well or translate texts to have a good vocabulary. That is my advice
[4:34:53] wikxy_: its nice coz max is like full immerssion
[4:35:30] Tazzie_T: you can always check online with the year make and model vehicle and it will tell you but generally all spark plugs are the same, UNLESS someone stripped the threads when they put them in worse case scenario use the socket with a breaker bar/ torque wrench
[4:35:35] wikxy_: butt imprimted seats sign of it broken in
[4:35:36] SwissDiss155: very much so LUL love it
[4:35:50] DakaraJayne: I want max to say cool whip üòÇüíú

[4:36:34] EduMyst1c: @JoshuaBR_ Good advice, It's nice to see another Brazilian here! KEKW
[4:36:53] JoshuaBR_: @lucas5676l Also, yes. Always watch english stuff. like streamers or tv shows and movies. Don't watch dubbed ones.
[4:37:06] wikxy_: does she want employment at liquid lib?
[4:37:24] babelonian16: @Tazzie_T omg ok well i guess i could open up another one and see if the 9/16ths fit and if it does it may be the threading. all the YT videos i watched used this size on my car type and year
[4:38:35] Tazzie_T: sometimes you can use a rubber mallet to tap the socket into place to make sure to get a snug fit before putting in the wrench also,
[4:39:06] wikxy_: its so finesse how they think of diff things to say to stay in rp hahaha
[4:39:29] EduMyst1c: wait, what was that? KEKW it was Harry Potter's Wall
[4:39:36] babelonian16: if i don't have a rubber mallet could i pad the socket with a towel or something to help cushion the blow?
[4:39:50] ubesarap: hi
[4:40:05] wikxy_: you should ask him to take his shirt off >.>
