[4:55:53] Ryflamer: If it's tied to phones it definitely seems like it could be interesting
[4:55:54] nekotinefemboy: It would be great for Bail and parole rp
[4:55:54] souper1: works both ways NODDERS
[4:55:55] KikiG4mer: @PENTA it would be better if it gave you a general area instead of exact locatiuon
[4:55:55] ForeheadSkin: if its not abused its probably fine
[4:55:57] BowlOfRice831: If you steal someone's phone, can you track everyone they have tracked?
[4:55:58] Snooch0: you know that everyone is going to abuse it
[4:55:59] mickflatley82: yeah, you can bait all 7 of them
[4:56:00] AWildChocobo: You should be able to disable it when u steal someone's phone
[4:56:00] CaptainKoma: There should be a limit 100%
[4:56:02] drippin_taco: It's too easy for anyone to use it
[4:56:03] TheDeafListener: @Morothemic twenty something dawg

[4:56:11] captainlucha: should always have to accept
[4:56:11] TheDeafListener: Life360 type beat
[4:56:11] StoneRanger: turn on your VPN

[4:56:12] NomadDee: The Ocean dump is dead
[4:56:12] The_Bob_Guy: @PENTA SLEEP on THIS 👉 🛏️
[4:56:13] ArticKong: 1 max would be good
[4:56:13] Pramado: You can just steal the phone and stop the tracking @PENTA
[4:56:13] boolove: you also shouldnt be able to accept a ping if youre like held up or kidnapped
[4:56:13] PillTheBomb: Do they have to accept every single ping request?
[4:56:14] forgotpassword: heckingDaisy  💕 pentawJ  4eva

[4:56:14] TheDeafListener: in case i get kidnapped
[4:56:17] 0ctember: rule of 4 tracker limit
[4:56:18] Eaglesgamer33: i could see it as cop baiting or crim baiting which could be really bad
[4:56:18] gunklobster: it's pretty dope i can't wait to see how it's used
[4:56:18] MisterTohru: is it unlimited? it should be 1
[4:56:23] YoshiTensho: Its a real thing IRL. Why is this so shocking?
[4:56:24] Dart44: I will accept this IF AND ONLY IF you can attach a phone to a dog and it'll run around and fuck with people LUL
[4:56:24] KALI_YUGA_ENJOYER: hmm
[4:56:25] BionicFireman: I'm gonna use that tracking stuff for Bail Conditions.
[4:56:25] xkevxxr: ya it needs a limit
[4:56:27] NumbFootToiletTuesday: maybe better if cops can see but not everyone
[4:56:28] prisonmike_: si
[4:56:29] stochasticdev: @PENTA honestly it kinda balances the phone stealing mechanic, which is pretty great for crims
[4:56:30] GreatAmericanTotalEclipse: c c
[4:56:31] AWildChocobo: Just remove the ppl listed when u steal it
[4:56:33] VideoBite: cops going to track every citizen LUL
[4:56:33] Fenix_Hero: Give their phone to someone and that person goes the opposite direction and ditches it in a bush lol
[4:56:40] WaterChampsoowoo: @YoshiTensho this is a video game
[4:56:41] StoneRanger: VPN fakes location
[4:56:43] robin1904: @BionicFireman OH GOD NOOO
[4:56:45] rykoxd93: gonna kidnap someone and then a search party of 10 are going to come looking for them because of the app

[4:56:53] TheDeafListener: @WaterChampsoowoo Weak mentality
[4:56:53] glazedscronut: if a ping requires to pull phone out, i don't see why it's bad
[4:56:53] Ele_Underscore: steal a phone and force anotehr hostage to take it KEKW
[4:57:00] Suhlurpy: Can use that for deaddrops now
[4:57:01] Cordis2Die: You can probably just dismiss everyone who tracks the phone in the app Shruge

[4:57:16] partyn4ked: pentawICKED
[4:57:16] Loremipsum21: It's gonna be aids when every member of a gang is tracking every other member of their gang at all times
[4:57:17] ThePurging: they were talking about using it for house arrest rp
[4:57:17] AzureMarquis: Yes
[4:57:18] Oced: could be fun to get someones phone and track their friends
[4:57:18] Anubix32: It looked like you can turn it off

[4:57:37] YoSupPAtruck: ohhhhh
[4:57:37] K31ma: aw
[4:57:37] Tzazi: You could give the phone to another goon, and have that gun hide in the maze or some shit
[4:57:38] AzureMarquis: you can't just keep tracking people
[4:57:38] thedirtyderk: Deadge

[4:57:49] Dart44: Oh dude you need to be able to just power off someone's phone and turn all that shit off
[4:57:54] TonkaTush: and if you forget to make them disable it, it enables more rp
[4:57:54] CrystalCoder: @its_giroux lol
[4:57:57] TheDeafListener: that mechanics hype
[4:57:57] TheeYeti: talk to the devs and find out how it works

[4:58:07] ramen_heada55: @the_spider_jesus sounds like it only works in a player's inventory
[4:58:12] ThatLittleRedBird: @the_spider_jesus groovy just said it only seems to work when it's on someone
[4:58:13] CaptainKoma: Yeah
[4:58:13] Eaglesgamer33: TRIE
[4:58:13] ButterKnife09: couldn’t cops just track crims
[4:58:13] early_retirement: or take battery out mechanic
[4:58:15] Uncus23: kinda makes it so that everyones getting their phones taken now
[4:58:15] Eaglesgamer33: TRUE

[4:58:19] BrockSamson66: Easy tracking is a very real modern thing
[4:58:20] homelessdepott: @PENTA elden ring? :(
[4:58:21] sneakynu: police take your phone when arrested, then allow tracking on it :|
[4:58:22] Snooch0: just track the whole city
[4:58:23] vjjsnakes: dude Chief playing Penta in UFC game last night was so damn funny…he seemed very drunk
[4:58:24] fuuhhzz: rule of 40
[4:58:25] Glumjee: PepegaPhone IM BEING TRACKED BY 7 ITALIANS

[4:58:34] IHITHOMERS_: @ButterKnife09 I think you have to accept the track
[4:58:36] mickflatley82: Daisy and Biggs tracking down Jordan 24/7
[4:58:38] Vanderic: like your top 3 contacts or somethin
[4:58:39] early_retirement: cuz the password might screw u
[4:58:41] brakfrog: turning off phones would be a cool mechanic
[4:58:42] Crimian7: Feel like this might be parking meters 2.0 somehow, like some good shit comes out of it
[4:58:43] K31ma: phone charge could be a cool thing to add
[4:58:46] Seetherrr: @Trufflecakes it can only show 1 at a time and you select the one you want
[4:58:48] Cordis2Die: NODDERS
[4:58:48] NomadDee: Is it you have to continuously request location updates or does it update itself.
[4:58:51] FattyPneumonia: oh shit its gonna be great with daisy
[4:58:54] Loremipsum21: It probably takes 2 seconds to open that app on their phone and click the x's on the names
[4:58:55] KidKickingRobot: yeah i get it
[4:58:56] early_retirement: fair
[4:58:58] ramen_heada55: @Trufflecakes i think it only shows 1 ping on the map at the time. whoever you clicked on
[4:59:02] Ele_Underscore: getting their radio KEKW
[4:59:05] Clairion: Steal someone's phone and track their friends NODDERS
[4:59:08] Dart44: I also like it because forcing them tod rop the phone leaves evidence to follow for cops
[4:59:09] Trufflecakes: @Seetherrr ohhhhh that makes sense. Would be funny if it was chaotic like that though.
[4:59:10] taeped: or just steal their phone and drop it
[4:59:11] hamburgsloz: I just realized all 4 of you got out of that
[4:59:22] Evanjuleen: vadeThink drop all of their phones

[4:59:32] AzureMarquis: It's not as good as it sounds. Still takes time for people to accept it and what not
[4:59:38] Breeconnaissance: think of the ambush/trap potential tho
[4:59:38] nekotinefemboy: NODDERS it has good bail and parole potential
[4:59:39] stochasticdev: nice having a proper goon
[4:59:40] Cordis2Die: @angryseesaw Same LUL
[4:59:45] Uncus23: this is a hold up, everyone drop your phones!
[4:59:47] FattyPneumonia: how the fuck did abner free tupac thats insane
[4:59:52] AzureMarquis: It's just a quick ping to people on your phone list.
[4:59:53] anextremeemo: waiting for Jordan to figure out how Daisy is tracking his ass is gonna be fun
[4:59:56] Seetherrr: @FattyPneumonia iced a cop

[5:00:04] Ele_Underscore: 50/50
[5:00:10] kleevedge: Would be cool to have multiple phones set up on tracker and just hide them in the trunks of your enemies vehicles
[5:00:11] Dart44: It also makes stealing phones potentially dangerous
[5:00:14] FattyPneumonia: the helmet guy
