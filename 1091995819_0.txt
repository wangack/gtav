[4:44:34] tombovard: OMEGALUL
[4:44:35] marcusi23: the problem with the cops is command or knowing when to break off. all cops could show up to a B class car but once your there someone should delegate we only need 2-3 cars on chase

[4:45:13] Luthercorpz: Cops don't want to breach bobcats so they like fk it LUL
[4:45:17] VTM___: I think the problem might be that cops get instant pings, when in real life between dispatch and low numers, it takes 5+ minutes for a response usually
[4:45:21] MapleCrusade: Do the cops have finite resources they can spend before it gets reset or do they have infinite supplies?
[4:45:22] Hento: Kyle is only EU lol
[4:45:26] RekkaPK: Rob the vault? I sleep. Joyriding? Real shit.
[4:45:28] buddha_hands: past announcements about going to calls (in part) comes from there being like mass murders, vaults, etc while ppl are chillin in PD or investigating off radio lol
[4:45:28] tiarimoore: do you think they maybe using all resources because they dont want cops to get bored and stop logging on? Honest question crmHmm uhnCozy uhnHug
[4:45:29] The_Butterfly_Man: so what really is booting drive the car around or to a place and get GNE?
[4:45:33] BlackManzHand1: the pd honestly needs a priority list for each shift
[4:45:37] marcusi23: @InfinityDigits well kyle is just lazy
[4:45:38] 0xygenhomie: i thought interceptors were for illegal racing.. not a d class stolen car
[4:45:42] graydaemon: @xzero314 They have a budget
[4:45:49] bmr236: Overall I just think that the PD needs to realign their priorities and actually set in stone what is a priority and what isn’t when certain things are going on. Someone boosting during a vault? That’s fine the fault is more important let the boosting go you know what I mean?
[4:45:54] wutangstyle613: you got off cop right around when things turned into a shit show, its all power tripping now
[4:45:57] cassdoodles: grab the interceptors + air 1 this man has a sandking OMEGALUL
[4:45:57] kromestyle: Yea cop numbers have been low for a while
[4:45:59] KingPresiden: @tiarimoore no
[4:46:00] superpat50: it's like they were using sops instead of pure aggression
[4:46:03] MapleCrusade: @graydaemon ty. It sounds like they should make the interceptor more heavy on that
[4:46:03] graydaemon: @xzero314 But their armory (supplies you have to buy) are limitless. So you have a spending limit and can't get over the top
[4:46:11] Hento: its in a bad space right now
[4:46:13] LarryFTW: What ever happened to the idea of dispatch being the ones to delegate who goes where?
[4:46:16] Luthercorpz: Problem recently has been so few cops on at a time too
[4:46:17] giiiiiinger: i just want to check fishing licenses for god's sake
[4:46:30] TheRarePotato: I wish the ping for D-B classes would be a little late
[4:46:37] Groovyg4u: so many issues with cops vs crim rp i woulnt even know where to start to try and fix it
[4:46:37] graydaemon: @xzero314 Repairs do that for the Interceptor. But they've become a bit smart about utilizing the budget for it I believe, which is what they should do.
[4:46:39] wutangstyle613: yeah negotiations only reallly work now when its Rhodes LUL

[4:47:04] marcusi23: people didnt want to follow dispatchers call outs

[4:47:34] tman610101: Walk in the police stacion and give them a peace of ur mind
[4:47:35] marcusi23: dispatchers could have had shit running smoothly i think.
[4:47:38] nosewiper69: "They bumpin/ our boat!"
[4:47:38] The_Butterfly_Man: they keep trying new things like a limit and stuff but they always stop after like a day like with dispatch delegating calls
[4:47:39] graydaemon: @Groovyg4u Add more cops in different time zones, make sure current cops have a period of time to refresh their memory and retrain a little bit (Opt in program), more negotiators on hand to deal with crim situations (more RP)
[4:47:44] ThePressedMan: james spittin facts
[4:47:45] OobiDoobiDoo: it was funny when you specifically asked for Rhodes cause you knew he'd want the chase OMEGALUL
[4:47:47] sharkyx619: makes sense
[4:47:47] veteran_porkchop: I’m kinda on the fence with the new negotiations too, like the point should be to de-escalate and it kinda expose the whole crim plan
[4:47:52] tombovard: @graydaemon just add more cops 4Head
[4:47:54] mobilemickey: 100% The PD needs more day to day delegations and direct leadership. its too bad dispatch giving direction didnt work out

[12:49:15] stylizedcorpse: one more loan moon2PAIN
[12:49:17] CannibalPuppies: @Russiah That's more dependent on how much he is approved for overall and ofc time. Credit score takes time to build. Actual months at most so. Took me a bit but I was able to get 740 in my 5 year journey with Credit. Some people get that faster. Just depends on your overall amount you have been loaned from all companies. Sorry for paragraph whipSip
[12:49:22] no_juic3: @willovip There’s people that say that credit cards are worth it because of the fact that if you get that card stolen or your account hacked then you are able to be compensated because it’s not ur money
[12:49:25] autobotashley: @Vladware I suggested that to him but he doesn't want to throw the $200 something down on a secured credit card to build credit, which I mean if your credit is high enough to cosign on a home loan I would say it's probably a decent score for a credit card IMO
