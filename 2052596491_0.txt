[0:36:40] b_goodhue: Made it can't dry cuz of the big open space
[0:36:55] hopalong92: I wonder if the weed has to be dried on the owned turf, like the house has to be where you own it?

[0:38:26] hopalong92: @itsedboi_ true, either it is scuffed or something or some step is missing
[0:39:18] zypher01: Chodie very consistent. Talk to him for sure but dont think a second grower would really do anything
[0:39:24] zypher01: drying and selling are the bottlenecks rn
[0:39:26] Klammath_: Goodness.
[0:39:29] MrCythe: hopefully they can fix that on the backend somehow
[0:39:31] tim_schu: this feels like a full headpop situation
[0:39:37] tinydemian: imagine this is where he got shot
[0:39:38] zypher01: ow
[0:39:48] ItsEdBoi_: @hopalong92 Well they ripped the racks out cause of the raid, so that reset the timer but yea idk ive heard some ppl say 2 days and others say 4 days so who knows how it actually works
[0:40:22] sandyg3: Lots of scuff all day it seems.

[0:43:09] killogic916: and not care to evenm help out with getting them back
[0:43:23] tim_schu: Growing ain't that bad if you aren't as paranoid as Chodie. Just plant it and go do a Grime run and then go pick it up.
[0:43:29] painkiller2828: Hi chat
[0:43:30] StreamElements: timmacHI
[0:43:45] zypher01: @killogic916 facts
[0:44:07] zypher01: The one time chodie didnt babysit his weed it got stolen
[0:44:15] MrCythe: he deleted 20 plants??
[0:44:17] zypher01: i think he has a reason to be paranoid lol
[0:44:18] MrCythe: oh my
[0:44:32] tim_schu: lose the plants or just reset the timer?
[0:44:39] killogic916: deleted the plants
[0:44:47] killogic916: by pickin up the rack before emptying the rack
[0:44:55] tim_schu: oh damn
[0:45:06] ItsEdBoi_: The raid didnt even happen till the next day too
[0:45:07] b_goodhue: Mr k did go with chodie when it did get stolen most likely it could had gotten meta
[0:45:24] killogic916: I wonder if he put in a tiucket for that even
[0:45:31] killogic916: or if they said to bad u fucked up
[0:45:56] hopalong92: @itsedboi_ yeah that kind of sucked how that happened. The boys will get it figured out
[0:45:59] tim_schu: 400 a plant?
[0:46:03] tim_schu: to grow
[0:46:06] zypher01: on turf its quite a bit
[0:46:20] killogic916: Chodie also said about 20k yeah
[0:46:32] 0rder613: Do you think that was like the washing machine scuff where you just had to take out and put back in?
[0:47:05] zypher01: Cleaning money will be very important
[0:47:22] zypher01: going to get so much washed cash from turf
[0:47:22] ItsEdBoi_: @hopalong92 Yea it aint that big of a deal its funny watching Ramee over react to the smallest of things though
[0:47:24] hopalong92: There was a lot because the racks were the medium sized ones right?
[0:47:27] j0nnyfiver: with all the houses in K’s name it’s probably smart for you guys to be drying in your apartments instead

[0:49:33] fiction12211: can have 8 in the house too is it worth buying 4 more
[0:49:47] hopalong92: Can K put the house in someone else’s name so when he is on his demon arc they have a stash spot?
[0:49:54] tim_schu: 8?! I heard increased to 6
[0:49:56] fiction12211: I think they did
[0:49:59] zypher01: They changed it to 6 at some point
[0:50:00] fiction12211: or 6
[0:50:03] killogic916: @hopalong92 yeah, he def should put them in som1 elses name
[0:50:20] jasonquinn2022: change the washing machines to the small ones and put 8 in
[0:50:33] spoobie09: You can have 8 to 10 small ones
[0:50:43] killogic916: @jasonquinn2022 why would big vs small make a diff on how many u can have?
[0:50:58] cybigil: Definitely get the packer before spending on anything else.
[0:51:09] timedoggg: random topic, what happened to the mechanic shop in prodigy? who took over
[0:51:16] fds_2: it would be easier if only one person bought and cleaned all the money from the people in the house
[0:51:18] zypher01: Washing the cash going to be the biggest bottleneck

[2:17:55] Steelhuf: ask you might be able to bring mack back
[2:17:56] mystic_mic: no uh-oh factor
[2:17:56] awww_peaches: Cornwood spent 120k of his own money for the cars wtf
[2:17:57] VirtualVoyager: Cornwood said something today about calling Mac back
[2:17:58] zypher01: Mack was too strong for this PD
[2:18:00] Galacticowboy: why do they arrest victims, the world will never know
[2:18:05] zipcodelive: same happened to snow
[2:18:07] LittleDuckiez: interesting
[2:18:09] VexV1: when did you make the new character cuz i think they changed their mind recently
[2:18:11] ghostman16: you could kill this one and bring in Mack LUL Kappa
[2:18:16] Lavitzboss: I think they wanted to "change the culture" so old characters didn't revert into old 3.0 stuff.
[2:18:18] TyrantPirate: i think cornwood is pushing to get mack back
[2:18:19] hopalong92: I get they want to make it new, but there were tons of great cops in 3.0 they could have in 4.0
[2:18:22] TheCarnifex: Caornwood was trying to get you back in.
[2:18:24] NoahS116: I feel like having old characters is needed because they already have the respect of these crims. Problem now is no one respects the cops
[2:18:28] BiGGHydro: Its BS
[2:18:32] 5nthony: nah Mack was just simply THAT GUY
[2:18:33] iTents: I think they are playing off of the lore that the Old PD is the reason why Los Santos failed, which is why no old PD are round
[2:18:33] Pazz: hummmm
[2:18:39] bigg504: Bryan was strong but he has his same character
[2:18:41] Lavitzboss: I think they wanted a culture change
[2:18:41] Steelhuf: Cornwood said to reach out to Mack they need seasoned officers that take no trainer
[2:18:43] MONSTERSbruh: I think it was partially story driven. They were going with the "Failed PD from 5 years ago" angle
[2:18:46] Momodanix: only difference is Mack had 3 years background on this server as cop
[2:18:52] getyourownjeeves: do you know your taser from your glock asking for a friend
[2:18:53] Lavitzboss: so new characters give chance for change
[2:18:54] zipcodelive: bones 100% was
[2:18:59] internalin: there are so many old cops
[2:19:05] dmaff15: they need to light up the Mack signal
[2:19:11] Lavitzboss: i dunno its really inconsistent
[2:19:18] jimmycobra: did you make trooper
[2:19:20] jjb4d: I saw TJ Mack’s name on a list to bring back from Cornwood
[2:19:24] Steelhuf: Cornwood said to reach out to mack
[2:19:24] Pazz: lol
[2:19:25] VexV1: angel made a new character
[2:19:28] GrandGuy95: its not like mack was super crucial in a way that he wouldnt be back
[2:19:40] mainmandaryl: Cornwood is trying to get alot of the old cops back as ftos
[2:19:42] Lavitzboss: I liked the idea though of having a new fresh set to set a new PD culture, but they didn't enforce it for everyone
[2:19:52] krustymcdoogle: I did only cop I watched
[2:19:57] Galacticowboy: I bet it was Ruth's call not to bring mack back LUL
[2:19:58] MarkusC12: why not just ask again if you can go on  MAC?
[2:20:02] GrandGuy95: well mack got screwed multiple times hows that really someone you wouldnt want back lol
[2:20:04] zipcodelive: @Lavitzboss and thats the issue
[2:20:13] Lavitzboss: yea thats the biggest problem
[2:20:15] cmerk_: The "failed cops" weren't the problem. It was exploding at the top that caused the downfall
[2:20:15] Lavitzboss: it wasnt consistent
[2:20:15] Splitcookie713: very hot or cold
[2:20:16] MONSTERSbruh: Kylie intro'd her Letty character in the last few months of 3.0. She's awesome
[2:20:18] internalin: mack's policing style would fit in just fine now too
[2:20:28] 723havok: Mack seemed to be mostly respected by crims
[2:20:38] Cruzier2012: lol ruth
[2:20:39] SailorWS: Ruth Madge

[6:01:04] Whatshisface117: I don't think there's any precedent set for it yet
[6:01:09] xtopspotx: it’s a worth a shot
[6:01:20] bluhnts_h: especially if ramee takes the case youd be FUCKD BUCKO lmao
[6:01:28] Splitcookie713: let’s apply that type of logic with Ks raids. He should be protected from his tenants but technically wouldn’t be
[6:01:29] IMW_Survivor: if your house gets raid bc of a "roommate" or tennent thats on the owner of the house
[6:01:33] bluhnts_h: lol
[6:01:35] jay2seam: pictures of suspect on the property maybe?
[6:01:58] Lepaca: if the owner is a known associate of KJ, there is plenty of RS for further investigation

[6:02:47] Splitcookie713: I see it going either way. That guy could be house sitting for all we know. K should try to sue and maybe set a precedent. would be cool to see
[6:02:51] soloaire: perhaps if they have the key on them, cause being on the panel doesn't mean they can open the door
[6:02:53] kitkatmollywhop: ahh gotcha
[6:03:04] soloaire: also designers have panel access
[6:03:13] xtopspotx: true
[6:03:14] QuenchingTurtle: maybe if you search him after he leaves the premises and find weed on him, theres probable cause
[6:03:17] iamforever89: having body cam would be good
[6:03:22] Splitcookie713: and what about interior designers
[6:03:42] soloaire: everyone on panel can say they were helping with furniture lol
[6:03:47] mainmandaryl: Yes
[6:04:06] xtopspotx: yeah I think if this happens the precedent will be set and the pd will see if they can do this or not it hasn’t been done before
[6:04:26] MetalicJive: @iamforever89 yeah but "body cam/dashcam" footage has been very touchy and not really allowable in the courts
[6:04:31] mainmandaryl: Yeah he said you were riding with him
[6:04:49] Splitcookie713: I think it would be fun to watch Ramee argue against it in court
[6:04:50] xtopspotx: it’ll piss people off for sure
[6:05:49] xtopspotx: find an irl case with this and you’ll find out the result if it’s argued correctly in rp
[6:06:32] xtopspotx: obviously they are in rp and have to learn that way

[6:27:45] xtopspotx: I understand it’s rp it’s rp just curious how these rules and protocols are established
[6:28:31] ThePatKing: @xtopspotx it’s RP but in a game. rules are made based on game mechanics. not everything that can be done irl and be done in game.
[6:28:49] xtopspotx: I understand that still curious
[6:28:52] Lairend: @xtopspotx nah they would if it was the amount the people are carrying in the city. mfs got bricks on em sometimes lol
[6:28:55] Splitcookie713: They were given 48hours to turn themselves in. There’s nothing in that house.
[6:29:10] xtopspotx: trueeee
[6:29:12] Shadyslim: well if someone has 500g of weed on them irl i would think a search warrant of their house would not be outragous
[6:29:17] Lairend: @xtopspotx also olds days nowadys think its all dicriminalized
[6:29:24] mordhaustv: so, if you had cop and crim characters, how would you play off having your cop character being focused on catching your crim character?
[6:29:43] Shadyslim: they tend to keep them seperate mord
[6:29:43] xtopspotx: that would be hilarious
[6:29:53] Elfmylife: ayy timmac on cop PogU
[6:29:55] IsetfireIzetfire: @mordhaustv You cant play both at the same time... Unless you're whippy that one time in 3.0
[6:29:56] xtopspotx: Liam going nits that he can’t catch gomer
[6:30:51] mordhaustv: ment to be a hypothetical, like, how would you do it.
[6:30:59] Noomad: gomer always one step ahead LUL
[6:31:01] boss_waka: @mordhaustv its confict of intrest so they don't,
[6:31:05] Shadyslim: if a player has a crim thats deep into the cocaine game and then on thier cop character they start catching things having to do with cocain they tend to pass them off to other offercise cuase of confliction
[6:31:05] xtopspotx: it would just be funny
[6:31:05] iGotP1nched: @mordhaustv usually a primary cop isnt your cop character
[6:31:23] iGotP1nched: @mordhaustv like the primary cop taking care of the investigation isnt your character
[6:31:39] IsetfireIzetfire: @mordhaustv Whippy had Croc arrest dundee in 3.0 once i think if you search it up you'll find it
