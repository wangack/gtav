[0:17:00] rayhxxn: They'll probably implement stuff from rp into gta6
[0:17:02] Athasin: @Vestfolding Rockstar was making a joke about how Cali/LA is full of models and men with Napoleon complexes. So they made the GTA Online female character tall and the male character short.
[0:17:03] lluiss__: they watch RP and i bet tehy took Ideas from devs to put in the GTA 6
[0:17:13] captainuzumakiv2: honestly gta rp is the only thing that makes  it seem fun anymore
[0:17:16] j_dizz19: Dean‚Ä¶how you feeling about Arsenal title hopes for second half of season??

[0:17:50] lluiss__: @mahad794 y
[0:17:54] Mishkamaul: I thought they bought 5m because of the popularity of RP and also hired some of 5m developers.
[0:17:59] FunChatt: @mahad794 yh
[0:18:00] Vestfolding: @aydanp16 All of them? Even the PD and Ems?

[0:19:06] TheOnlyCraved: "ockstar Games purchased the group in August for an undisclosed fee" talking about FiveM, GTA 6 gnna be crazy
[0:19:20] xGotNoClout: o7
[0:19:35] Lord_Legolas: despite Rockstar own fiveM, I don't this they are super involved, and just let fiveM do they thing, and fiveM devs are 100% watch a proggression and bugs
[0:19:38] BDG_parth28: Hmmm
[0:19:39] adrian_md46: Shruge
[0:19:41] handgunhartz: A good amount, there's no doubt
[0:19:41] TheS1lentPuppet: I'd say 2 mil
[0:19:41] BDG_parth28: I don't
[0:19:41] getanime: billions probably
[0:19:44] joaozinho___: are you beeping at the shutters to open/close ?
[0:19:47] Mishkamaul: 7 figures I bet
[0:19:47] samjack007007: gotta be at 7 figures
[0:19:52] BDG_parth28: 10Ms
[0:19:53] TheOnlyCraved: 2 mill crazyy low
[0:19:56] xGotNoClout: Billions LUL
[0:20:00] itsmo_h: 10 20 mil
[0:20:00] rayhxxn: Around 100 mil probably
[0:20:01] brook_cs2: i reckon maybe 10ms
[0:20:01] handgunhartz: 7 figures is a good guess
[0:20:01] TheOnlyCraved: in 10s of millions maybe 100s
[0:20:01] lordevileye: 2-5m
[0:20:04] qackoz: $1
[0:20:05] theslip: Def more than 10m
[0:20:05] its_me_mpyy: around 100mil maybe
[0:20:05] MDM4ever1986HD: 5m
[0:20:07] DrShreyWay: 5million
[0:20:12] Athasin: @Mishkamaul Hopefully. Or they did it so they can curb modding when GTA 6 online comes out for like a year (to get that shark card rev) and then allow it when PC releases.
[0:20:13] samjack007007: GTA6 RP will be mad
[0:20:20] MDM4ever1986HD: ^
[0:20:22] TheMagnificentBastard: Dean you ever had that good savings grocery shopping feeling. I'm having that now
[0:20:22] hippieh8rlol: 7 figures plus the peace of mind of not being closed down/sued
[0:20:25] ClutchStache: who got paid?
[0:20:25] Athasin: Isn't that what Twitch does?
[0:20:26] tito23q: not much tbh I reckon they strong armed them or else they‚Äôd shut it down
[0:20:30] theslip: nopixel in gta6 will be interesting
[0:20:30] Tsithik: Tbf it really aint our business
[0:20:36] FunChatt: They have top tier lawyers
[0:20:37] ihavegoodluck777: deansoFro big shiesty
[0:20:39] brook_cs2: thats how it should be doe, like every game out there getting leaked, people that leak gta get life, thats how you keep hype
[0:20:46] TheS1lentPuppet: What's the plan for today
[0:20:46] hhimy: Is it harder to play a cop than being a criminal?
[0:20:47] XSkyKingdomX: good morning Mr dean
[0:20:47] synzzo: when VI releases on PC day one rp gonna go crazy
[0:20:53] MDM4ever1986HD: we all want to know
[0:20:54] khlaah: I really need to reinstall and get going learning the game, so I can do RP somewhere just looks fun
[0:20:59] theslip: @hhimy yes but he wont have to worry about it for much longer
[0:21:02] xGotNoClout: @Deansocool How long into GTA 6 do you think we will get a RP server. Surely it will take a long time until they get it modded enough to be worth while
[0:21:05] hestonfamily: they threw a guy in jail for life for hacking there game because he said he do it again
[0:21:10] scootypebbles: @synzzo RP probably won't be available on GTA 6 until 1-2 years after release
[0:21:33] MDM4ever1986HD: @hestonfamily wasn't he in a hotel room or something?
[0:21:37] hhimy: @theslip is he leaving?
[0:21:43] Panos_97: Who owns NoPixel btw?
[0:21:45] sonadapop: mornin Dean
[0:21:45] theslip: @hhimy nah but he getting fired
[0:21:47] brook_cs2: i dont think it will take too long since fiveM is part of rockstar and they know how popular RP is
[0:21:52] hippieh8rlol: hoping Rockstar buying 5M will make it easier since they'll be willing to release code and all of that
[0:21:53] brook_cs2: i reckon it comes out with online
[0:21:55] MDM4ever1986HD: @panos_97 Koil
[0:22:00] mynameismikeyd: did you hear about T-Pain being told by Rockstar that he can‚Äôt stream or play on GTA RP as he is working on GTA6 music, then like a week later they bought FiveM and he was hella confused
[0:22:01] coo_chi_chi: pocket watching is my favourite activity Pog
[0:22:04] SlyyZA: smh, where is lovemore
[0:22:05] kriss_jm: if the PC version is not launching the same year then RP won't even be out till way later
[0:22:05] Panos_97: Oh I see
[0:22:06] Khosi7: 5.0 will be in gta 6 :P
[0:22:08] JeePecks: @scootypebbles true, probably no GTA 6 RP until a few years
[0:22:15] md783: koil 50%, x 25% and buddha 25%
[0:22:15] MDM4ever1986HD: isn't Koil the main and Buddah the co owner?
[0:22:16] VioraX: @theslip why he getting fired?
[0:22:20] BDG_parth28: 4 no , there is 1 another person

[4:39:51] Athasin: What happened in the court is evidence, so you can charge him later after you get hard proof.
[4:39:52] BadRabbits: My experience with Purjery is that you have to have material proof (not just testamony) that someone has knowingly lied under oath. once you got that it's game.
[4:40:01] Crispy_Auto: @Bounty4321 nope
[4:40:02] Dypadl: just take your time make sure speedy didn't rehire him or something, it's not a misunderstanding, collect all the shit, cause he was lying about more stuff

[4:46:56] AndreSays: @Deansocool you have to take into account they do transcoding too
[4:46:57] DevilDF: Monthly
[4:46:57] avoidschickens: several millions montyhly
[4:46:59] nickbane20: google says 5 mil/month
[4:47:00] BIumenT0pF: thats not smth chat can reliable answer
[4:47:01] caknorriz: rented
[4:47:01] imarainbowsixnub: @tvsA9 makes sense makes sense
[4:47:02] xprnstr_twitch: what are we waiting on
[4:47:02] ShinJiHun: @Deansocool Imagine all the storage it takes to save vods of every single vod from every single streamer including 0 viewer streamers
[4:47:02] eiyzen: bro we just watch twitch cuuuh
[4:47:03] v3x_75: DAMN
[4:47:04] avoidschickens: but at cost, since owned by AWS
[4:47:05] SuuWasTaken: A lot, it's not just thousands (ten thousands of servers) it's also infrastructure to the datacenter and the actual building of datacenters @Deansocool
[4:47:06] abaccibear: at least $1
[4:47:07] Dbalense: i mean you guys talk about servers but storage capacity for  every vod for every streamer.
[4:47:07] theslip: 5mil/month
[4:47:07] eiyzen: how we supposed to know
[4:47:07] ixpops: employees are probably the largest cost after servers
[4:47:07] Noah_: yes a day
[4:47:09] rayhxxn: Depending on traffic
[4:47:10] psylongti: Each streamer, each viewer costs
[4:47:10] usinatlanta: asking twitch chat LuL
[4:47:12] shockingriley: yeah it‚Äôs also egress (bandwidth)
[4:47:12] YungKingUtch: no not a month
[4:47:13] ObeseBodybuilder: my old job had a service(many services run on a server) which cost around 100k a year to just run
[4:47:13] lemmytunngainus: nah chat be tripping hard
[4:47:15] raqsypoo: they buying the servers as a service, thats why also
[4:47:16] devlin0221: The bandwidth they must be paying for is millions a month too
[4:47:17] Viotoz: they own the sservers ? how they lose money LULW
[4:47:18] YungKingUtch: I mean day
[4:47:18] avoidschickens: twitch is hosted on servers from their owner
[4:47:19] Î∏åÎ†åÌä∏: They made ~3 billion last year and that wasnt enough to break even @Deansocool
[4:47:20] raqsypoo: renting not buying*
[4:47:21] Raccoonuary: AWS is seperate from twitch though both part of amazon so twitch still has to pay AWS as far as i understand.
[4:47:22] NobleNate: 4-6m per month
[4:47:24] WeirdBeardPlays: $4,000,000 ‚Äì $6,000,000 every month for the Data traffic
[4:47:26] edfromwork: twitch‚Äôs monthly costs are around 7 million a month
[4:47:28] rchouse: on law bouseCuh
[4:47:29] blackhippie_7: but Amazon owns twitch and AWS, are they charging themselves??
[4:47:30] ffriedegg: Twitch also gives away a ton of games.
[4:47:31] Jay_B06: the owen of twitch probably get like 200mil in bonuses yearly
[4:47:34] improvisablex: @Deansocool Facebook spends around 20 million a year on just the buildding for servers
[4:47:35] Mickeychr: He pleaded guilty to possession at the beginning, thanks bro LUL
[4:47:35] ArchReaper7: @Raccoonuary correct
[4:47:35] nickbane20: how the FUCK can they spend 1B in a year?
[4:47:36] kingceejay90: that is correct @Raccoonuary
[4:47:38] rayhxxn: @viotoz servers don't run for free
[4:47:38] blizard_lbd: nopixel 3 was ¬£120k a year for like 20 people on it‚Ä¶.
[4:47:38] Athasin: @Deansocool Just think about how many VODs you have saved on your channel alone and multiple it for every Twitch user that has a sub button
[4:47:40] Flamezez: By simple calculations we can assume that Twitch may spend around $4,000,000 ‚Äì $6,000,000 every month for the Data traffic and $771,000 on top of that for servers.
[4:47:40] f0rbin: just because amazon owns the servers, doesn't mean twitch is getting bandwidth for free
[4:47:41] tvsA9: @Raccoonuary pretty sure they have a disount. else amazon would be ruining its own subsidiary
[4:47:41] slatt5: it all sounds like yappanese to me
[4:47:43] jinnytolls: @Deansocool I worked at meta and a smaller tech company, our aws bill is in the millions annual. At their scale its probably 100+ mil especially since they do video + storage live
[4:47:43] armedgolem01: twitch wants go woke they have been going broke for it ever since lol
[4:47:43] AndreSays: @Deansocool Twitch faces steep operating costs to support livestream content at such a large scale. In a 2022 blog post, Clancy stated that each high-volume streamer on Twitch costs the company about $1,000 per month, citing Amazon Web Service's interactive video rates.
[4:47:46] KillaKH0le: Data storage also for all the vods
[4:47:48] tenaja22: damn, start watching and Denzels in court. you got a bed there yet? @Deansocool
[4:47:51] m4l1kkk: Employees, hosting servers, R&D, offices and paying off debts
[4:47:51] Didact94: amazon the online shopping front isn't profitable. AWS is the biggest web hosting service on the planet. I build data centers for AWS and you wouldn't believe how much they pay in rent.
[4:47:53] ArchReaper7: YEP a fuckton
[4:47:54] NobleNate: @blackhippie_7 the servers cost money to run, doesn't matter who owns it
[4:47:55] xBobbie_: rameeHaHAA
[4:47:55] Mikal_Humblebutter: they make a lot of add revenue
[4:47:56] nabstonekido: No
[4:47:57] Roxxitensai: kekw
[4:47:57] Athasin: Nah because AD block
[4:47:57] DevilDF: No ads on VODs
[4:47:58] MDM4ever1986HD: HUH
[4:47:58] Fallen_Mist: everyone gotta eat
[4:47:59] Dypadl: "TWITCH OVERVIEW Revenue $228.9M Employees 1,146" from a random site
[4:47:59] Grizzalopa: XQC asked chatgpt @Deansocool Watch that video XQC asked chatgpt @Deansocool Watch that video XQC asked chatgpt @Deansocool Watch that video XQC asked chatgpt @Deansocool Watch that video
[4:48:00] susge1: nah
[4:48:01] SuuWasTaken: #KYJelly #Ad
[4:48:01] ImOome: those ads dont pay as much
[4:48:02] BadRabbits: nono adds don't cover the data costs
[4:48:03] improvisablex: Not enough. Ads are getting less profitable
[4:48:03] chaosproductions: not enough. thats why ads are crazy
[4:48:05] djdd_: they take money from subs as well
[4:48:05] CowZ_Moo: ads don't pay for the servers
[4:48:06] brook_cs2: but you also need licenses to pay for certain ads
[4:48:06] tvsA9: damn, xqc with his streams must be fukin twitch up
[4:48:09] chmbrs: dawg
[4:48:09] xDeadxRabbitx: deansoF deansoF deansoF
[4:48:10] Raccoonuary: it's kind of like in the army how your unit used funds to buy from army (maybe not exactly)
[4:48:13] amanmama: But the user base is not that huge compared to other social media
[4:48:13] AndreSays: each high value streamer costs about $1000 a month
[4:48:15] Grizzalopa: It was like 9 million per month for xqc hosting or some shit
[4:48:15] ally0002: 07
[4:48:16] Drkdream: the problem is that hey are spending more than they are earning @Deansocool
[4:48:16] tenaja22: Those are targeted ads towards you Kappa
[4:48:16] reichgeist: cyber security isnt cheap they spend millions on millions on that too
[4:48:16] Superhank: twitch will probably pay AWS all the potential they couldve made with some weird tax laws and paying yourself kinda bullshit
[4:48:17] CutestHamster: @Deansocool twitch makes way less than youtube on ad rev because they cant target ads, no user data
[4:48:20] susge1: you get more per person than per company
[4:48:22] YungKingUtch: condom ads who you been watching on twitch
[4:48:22] Jaxuhali: condom ads for gamers PepeLaugh
[4:48:25] Bra1nfarts: Maybe twitch is running like Twitter did before elon came to power LUL
[4:48:25] StrawHatShaneo: There just sooooo many streamers as well
[4:48:26] Juvraj: also twitch prime probably looses money
[4:48:27] kevin_2k0317: prediction
[4:48:27] batsonnc: 40% of twitch users use adblocker too
[4:48:29] Athasin: No because of AD block. Also remember subs don't get ads including prime subs @Deansocool
[4:48:30] pluck_it: @Deansocool  viewership spiked a ton during covid since everyone was home, so now they cut a lot due to downward trend
[4:48:30] NobleNate: twitch has the lowest ad cpm in the market space
[4:48:32] Cosm1cChaos1: The only company that's profitable in live streams is youtube but yt is super strict because they have to please ad buyers
[4:48:33] oven_obeun: legal teams as well
[4:48:38] Mikal_Humblebutter: i don't think twitch chat is the place to learn about this stuff FeelsGoodMan
[4:48:38] Blavod: They don't have automated ad sales like YouTube does
[4:48:39] tvsA9: Personalized ads
[4:48:40] Zayrow1: i feel like twitch turbo really fucks them
[4:48:42] kingceejay90: 10%
[4:48:43] VioraX: ofc
[4:48:43] BadRabbits: yeah
[4:48:43] rayhxxn: Yes
[4:48:44] Superhank: too many people use adblock on twitch too
[4:48:44] kingceejay90: 100%
[4:48:44] sitibaba: of course
[4:48:45] brook_cs2: yes
[4:48:45] sibevh: yeah
[4:48:46] chrisrox22: yes
[4:48:47] Noah_: yes
[4:48:47] SuuWasTaken: DATA = $$$$$$$$$
[4:48:48] AndreSays: advertisers pay more
[4:48:48] zjdvvvv: yeah obv
[4:48:49] Vision_ZA217: yes
[4:48:49] dylan_ivy: personalized ads yes
[4:48:49] Grizzalopa: Just hosting xqc's stream alone costs twitch millions per month @Deansocool
[4:48:49] Roxxitensai: for sure
[4:48:50] BadRabbits: targeted adds make way more money
[4:48:50] Fallen_Mist: you dont waste ads on ppl that wont buy
[4:48:50] patters___: They spent to grow and then didnt grow so costs are high
[4:48:51] charmelli: ye
[4:48:52] Morgaaann: massively
[4:48:52] chaosproductions: it benefits the ad companies, so you can get paid more
[4:48:52] Cosm1cChaos1: You can sell it
[4:48:52] Ahs0kaTano: yeah because they direct certain ads to people
[4:48:54] kamish233: @Deansocool i found out they spend 6 mill. on data traffic and 771k on servers, but dont know if its true
[4:48:54] Slouii: you can ask for my from adverts
[4:48:54] YungKingUtch: yeah targeted ads
[4:48:54] kevin_2k0317: predictions mod so we can make some money üòÇ
[4:48:55] chrisrox22: data $$$$$$$
[4:48:55] SuuWasTaken: law
[4:48:56] KillaKH0le: Asa company it benefits them as they get more clicks from ads
[4:48:56] Roxxitensai: more money
[4:48:58] chrisrox22: law
[4:48:58] CutestHamster: people would just lie when asked
[4:48:59] BadRabbits: Google spent billions setting up that system
[4:48:59] Î∏åÎ†åÌä∏: EU law
[4:48:59] EPiQ: They can sell the data, or use the data and treat the gaining of the data as a cost.
[4:49:00] mavericks312: honestly twitch needs to drop the prime sub there losing millions off that alone
[4:49:00] Didact94: 90% of amazon money comes from AWS because most every company hosts services with them. Just like Kick uses AWS servers to host their streaming service
[4:49:01] Dypadl: privacy stuff
[4:49:01] ScreenFresh: yes, you target more people who are more likely to buy products
[4:49:02] Xen_Crypt: Losing money is kinda a bullshit metric, part of the idea is to invest in growth. Make money later, not now
[4:49:02] Juvraj: its hard
[4:49:02] MexiBrent: there isnt relally away
[4:49:02] Grumplestillskin: prob their young audience
[4:49:03] susge1: they can't collect enough
[4:49:03] Vision_ZA217: legality
[4:49:04] m4l1kkk: They can target ads via categories and IPs
[4:49:04] Superhank: GDPR
[4:49:04] lisamkor0u: how you be streaming and you ask us chatters the question
[4:49:04] sibevh: companies pay more for user targeted adds
[4:49:04] sitibaba: how they gonna get our all info
[4:49:05] rayhxxn: You have to pay for data protection
[4:49:06] jinnytolls: @Deansocool I worked at meta and a smaller tech company, our aws bill is in the millions annual. At their scale its probably 100+ mil especially since they do video + storage live. They also have way smaller ad revenue as their audience is smaller and alot of streamers are straight up brand risks.
[4:49:06] Blavod: Amazon doesn't have the tech for it
[4:49:06] brook_cs2: expensive plus laws
[4:49:08] skinnylegend000: the legal on that is hella expensive
[4:49:09] charmelli: you can sell it
[4:49:09] avoidschickens: that can be a terms violation
[4:49:10] rchouse: data can be sold in bulk for a lot of moneyu
[4:49:10] xDeadLife_RS: @Zayrow1 Turbo makes them way more money than the ad revenue.
[4:49:11] Athasin: That requires them to take people's data.
[4:49:12] psylongti: Low viewcoount streamers also cost a ton, still have data but no ad revenue
[4:49:13] Encryptic: Don't forget, they have to build and maintain this platform, hire people to do that. Even advertisements don't happen free, they hire people to call up companies and get them to advertise.
[4:49:13] chaosproductions: because livestreams are harder to classify... too many variety streamers
[4:49:13] batsonnc: sell your info like data?
[4:49:13] Superhank: google paid like 2bn or something in fines
[4:49:14] SuuWasTaken: Especially EU Law is INCREDIBLY strict
[4:49:14] tvsA9: ppl hate
[4:49:15] connorcrow15: too many anon
[4:49:16] JIGACHAD123: what data can they collect from us here lol
[4:49:16] xprnstr_twitch: time for a verdict before tsunami
[4:49:17] captain_steve_420: isnt the storm coming soon?
[4:49:18] kingceejay90: think about it Dean, have you ever thought about something or clicked on a website and then you get an ad for it on youtube or any application? @Deansocool
[4:49:21] unstoble1337: is this court cuz of the mizkif thingy?
[4:49:21] zjdvvvv: It's harder to track on a website like twitch
[4:49:21] armedgolem01: the problem with twitch is they have to 3rd party almost everything they do so a company that has no middle man will always be ahead
[4:49:22] chmbrs: youtube needs to make a Live tab like they did with YT Music. the amount of people that would switch is insane.
[4:49:22] SantaSkaarr: google = lots of data. google owns youtube.
[4:49:23] Jay_B06: the law be hitting them
[4:49:24] Grizzalopa: Just hosting xqc's stream alone costs twitch millions per month @Deansocool
[4:49:25] amanmama: Google has the best system for it and also meta
[4:49:28] wafiy637: o7
[4:49:31] MexiBrent: they can maybe do it by age and sex to target adds but not by waht you search
[4:49:31] slatt5: keep twitch unprofitable maybe we‚Äôll finally all go outside if it crumbles LUL
[4:49:31] tzloaf: when they got twitch prime users they have user data from Amazon purchases
[4:49:33] Matsus92: Verdict time
[4:49:33] kingceejay90: thats Personalized Data
[4:49:35] woolfdesign: These companies are going to figure out how to get rid of Ad block soon
[4:49:35] zjdvvvv: Google is massive Twitch is tiny
[4:49:37] ZP_Marshmallow: o7
[4:49:37] Vision_ZA217: true
[4:49:37] tvsA9: Google owns everything about you. Twitch doesnt
[4:49:38] ArchReaper7: any remotely 'big' streamer, in a vacuum, is profitable for twitch. the problem is the thousands of <10 viewer andys
[4:49:40] SecretChiley: EU law is very strict in Internet privacy
[4:49:40] lemmytunngainus: here comes the ruling xdd
[4:49:40] scairyterry: nah they ain't collecting my MW2 Xbox Party Comms
[4:49:41] tr0kgaming: investors also expect not just good money they expect ridiculous amounts of money or they go somewhere else
[4:49:41] chrisrox22: LOOOOOOOOOL o7
[4:49:42] auto_wow: small streamers with no viewers are taking up massive amounts of server space with very little revenue @Deansocool
[4:49:43] charmelli: KEKW
[4:49:44] qats: lets get this dub!
[4:49:44] grntcr: a leaf blow dryer?
[4:49:45] SuuWasTaken: LOCK IN CHAT
[4:49:45] Mickerson2: just read they spend about 6 million on data and 800k for servers per month
[4:49:45] SCPFFFF: twitch does not spend that much on data traffic and servers, amazon would be fronting the cost of that supstanially for the use of their aws
[4:49:50] SuuWasTaken: Gazing Gazing Gazing Gazing
[4:49:51] NobleNate: why you blow drying your leafs?
[4:49:52] RonJon: PauseChamp

[4:50:41] Diaz10gtg: how did x got charged with the gun and he gets away with this lol
[4:50:42] devlin0221: Local Lives Dont Matter
[4:50:42] woolfdesign: oof
[4:50:49] ezrandir: He should not have pleaded guilty to the pot charge
[4:50:51] devlin0221: Local Lives Dont Matter LLDM

[4:51:01] jpdubs3: LLDM

[4:51:02] chaosproductions: thats crazy.... if the rental was registered to him
[4:51:03] shockingriley: oop
[4:51:04] Blavod: X was just possession basically
[4:51:05] jinnytolls: @SCPFFFF Just because they share parent companies doesnt mean its free. They are seperate companies and the business units need to recover costs from one another
[4:51:07] charmelli: o7
[4:51:08] Athasin: @Diaz10gtg Because Judge Murphy as on one, and now he's paying the price.
[4:51:15] Î∏åÎ†åÌä∏: he plead guilty to felony possession
