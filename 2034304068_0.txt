[2:08:14] 0Laetitia0: and she doesn't run anymore
[2:08:16] Raazetko: Michael and jenny has had major character growth
[2:08:16] jimmymr1988: I still felt bad for Michael the other day when he told Jenny he feels left out of the family
[2:08:18] Chritters: Jenny is being vulnerable and not being defensive.
[2:08:21] nomaddepths: "MOIST!" "HUH" is the only way i see things happening
[2:08:22] Chritters: Chat is just being stupid.
[2:08:33] filipe_vasconcellos_: @Chritters  NODDERS
[2:08:37] colacubes1: yeah I haven’t seen Michael turtle often
[2:08:49] erinord: They have been communicating effectively NODDERS

[2:10:05] minnmor: The Family really needs to talk more with each other together.
[2:10:06] Bruvverbean: @filipe_vasconcellos_ KEKW
[2:10:23] nomaddepths: Poor guy gets so excited when jenny praises him and then gets shit on by everyone else and then he turtles from them but not to her
[2:10:23] Raazetko: oh yes. the list that he had KEKW
[2:10:55] Bruvverbean: but Jenny has had that work pressure before, he's not

[2:11:33] ZalenaStar: Im really enjoying watching you both grow
[2:11:47] Bruvverbean: oh that was a huge help, everyone was bored and wanted to stir something
[2:12:37] nomaddepths: Being told she did good cuz its her isnt even a compliment if anything that eould add pressure
[2:12:56] nomaddepths: Cuz shes expected to perform at a certain level
[2:13:22] 0Laetitia0: it doesn't recognize the work and effort behind the success

[2:15:23] elenafae: I think a 2nd love language for Jenny (to jenny not from jenny) would be Gift giving. because jenny appreciates when someone thinks of her enough to get her something she would like, maybe?
[2:15:27] sreylas: He came to Jenny's defense, and jenny punched him
[2:15:32] minnmor: quality time together in chopping cars after mick doesnt get even debuty mayor

[2:18:59] filipe_vasconcellos_: for votes
[2:19:13] minnmor: "hey wanna come with me to see cops, they want to get more old cops to be with them?" :)
[2:19:35] erinord: I actually think he would
[2:19:43] Raazetko: " Hey wanna go see the cops you bombed 5 years ago? "

[2:22:44] filipe_vasconcellos_: who cares
[2:22:48] ImMcGuirk: That mac money would really help with a bench ffs Nick nikkisRiot
[2:22:57] Bruvverbean: @ImMcGuirk nikkisGiggle
[2:23:16] sreylas: I would think the bench would put Dahlia on same footing as Mary then fucking her over
[2:24:00] csplisskin: classic LS
[2:24:25] Bruvverbean: I don't think it would fuck with Mary if you worked together
[2:24:53] nikolegrnd: nikkisSip
[2:26:16] filipe_vasconcellos_: Kareem is a source
[2:26:27] nyx_constellation: hiroDeb kareeeeeem
[2:26:30] Bruvverbean: but that's her deal not Dahilas monkaHmm
[2:26:36] minnmor: if its not the same line?
[2:26:46] sreylas: fuck mary then
[2:26:58] ImMcGuirk: oh well business has to be dirty at times
[2:27:04] Bruvverbean: wait she still doesnt get cost KEKL
[2:28:12] minnmor: i think she should get them cheaper than the other mechanics if she did put money in the marys business
[2:28:33] nyx_constellation: That seems wrong
[2:28:34] csplisskin: nikkisSip
[2:28:35] Colayyyy: The way she mentioned Michael, I think she's only loyal to Mary for Michael
[2:28:43] filipe_vasconcellos_: if she got the parts only for her and another contact for materials she wouldn't be fucking mary
[2:28:47] Bruvverbean: depends if the loyalty is a two way street
[2:28:57] mrtrumjm: It sounds like they've been mugged off.
[2:29:39] nyx_constellation: Well she wouldn't buy from Mary anymore. Wouldn't be reliant
[2:29:54] KirkHasselen: even if she only gets a few sets a day that purely her own profit it makes a difference.
[2:29:54] minnmor: time to get that bench, get blueprints, get supplier and make own parts ;D
[2:30:34] minnmor: @KirkHasselen ^
[2:30:42] KirkHasselen: they have the bluerprints.
[2:30:58] colacubes1: I mean they might be able to get Kareem as a supplier ?
[2:31:08] Bruvverbean: if she made her own parts she'd be doubling her profit (going from the twatter war prices)
[2:31:18] colacubes1: oh fair
[2:31:27] sreylas: think all they have to do is open up supply line with union
[2:31:29] nyx_constellation: Maybe notHOA can help
[2:31:33] minnmor: i dont think its enough to have one supplier, need more than one person
[2:32:06] nyx_constellation: Right now Mary has a monopoly, of course she likes that better
[2:32:17] colacubes1: I’m guessing brick is union lol

[2:43:47] stridro: if he comes 2nd to max he going hate it
[2:43:51] Chritters: The Deputy Mayor position is going to be interesting how it works out. It's either going to thrive or it's going to hamstring that person with not much to do but restrictions.
[2:43:53] Bruvverbean: Max and Michael rarely meet aswell nikkisGiggle
