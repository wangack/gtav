[2:14:38] Nightbot: abdoss Do not share in-game information regarding other players/content creators. Nora doesn't want to know and this can instead harm in-game decisions. This may result to a time out or ban without warning. (Meta-gaming is when you tell Nora what a different streamer is doing on the same server) Thank you. noraexPog
