[0:38:12] Akkara_: Why buying GW books when you can listen to Ben giving a summary :D
[0:38:15] Ex_Libris85: it will never be mentioned again
[0:38:16] SixTonTitan: Angron got a HUGE dub for Chaos in his Arks book
[0:38:21] Tureallious: Knowing the plan requires, GW know the plan...
[0:38:24] settle3m: With that shirt, Tom is the Lion's half brother.
[0:38:27] Imperator_Benny: @indianajason the ol' dirty bza

[0:38:50] Dsungaripterus: Don't upset Khorne, its 8 weeks 8 days! boupheGrr
[0:38:55] MahonsTV: @alexJaMeg yeah but he did not truly die
[0:39:03] SoaringTurkeyVulture: angron is red, angry, and comes around every few weeks? Sounds familiar
[0:39:05] Thirianna: it's probably in the novel
[0:39:05] Cetsuo: wait for the novel Kappa
[0:39:07] TheAatar: Anton appears every month, like a red tide
[0:39:09] Cobwebb96: Vashtor gonna reassemble cadia for reasons

[0:39:11] osici: I think that's the novel

[0:40:33] Yyerthen: Yeah all set up.
[0:40:34] Cobwebb96: Tom is GW toady
[0:40:36] MahonsTV: If we only have setup we can keep milking the setup
[0:40:43] hazari13: The three items combined also give chaos access to the webway now don't forget
[0:40:48] from_somewhere: GW are kings of the narrative equivalent of the mario infinite staircase.
[0:40:57] mothrux: toom and boon POGGERS
[0:40:59] sirpickleboy: don't you just love five whole books that never have a climax
[0:41:00] ansonhax: Chaos vs Tyranids YES
[0:41:01] voltzzzzzz36: Isnt a book series like this supposed to be the catalyst for the next editions?
[0:41:05] SmellyFishHandsDurian: @mahonstv ah yes, the edging marketing model
[0:41:06] from_somewhere: Shadow in the warp

[0:41:35] badspoons: If they win, we all lose
[0:41:37] ManicMolesa: Hive Fleet Maguffin
[0:41:40] Cetsuo: im ok with that
[0:41:41] geekaylee: The 40k writing is getting more and more like WWE wrestling
[0:41:44] squeaky_s: And that mega bomb also mends the maledictum rift
[0:41:46] Benersan: I dunno they wouldn't do a rivalry that doesn't have the imperium
[0:41:48] beatlesanders: Chaos saving Terra is a wonderful idea
[0:41:52] ansonhax: Actually it'll be the Primaris-er Marines that stop the Tyrandis
[0:41:54] VoynichArchitect: @Dsungaripterus I think you mean Amazon Fulfillment Center
[0:41:54] Heroically_Average: Have they tried just killing the Tyranids? Are they stupid?
[0:42:03] Tomix1199: so whos Turanid Link?
[0:42:04] Dsungaripterus: So it's Slaan tech? Kremol returning? OOOO
[0:42:07] MahonsTV: opening the webway in the imperial palace?
[0:42:07] Tomix1199: Tyranid*
[0:42:12] Dsungaripterus: *kremlo
[0:42:13] ansonhax: They're going to announce the Primariest Marines
[0:42:16] ManicMolesa: crack open the door on terra again
[0:42:22] sirpickleboy: They'll probably use it for the webway portal on terra, old war in the webway part 2
[0:42:23] claimtrooper: abaddon, the alarm clock
[0:42:25] Yyerthen: Also Vashtorr won but is not a god yet?
[0:42:27] ansonhax: Russ next??
[0:42:31] Goblocker: oh maybe the Khan will show up
[0:42:31] Diamon_Boots: Invading commoragh?
[0:42:31] lamashdeux: In that case then it'd be nice if Harlequins got more stuff if theyre getting involved.
[0:42:33] antecave: they will tunnel up into the emperors ass from below in the webway, obviously.
[0:42:36] SixTonTitan: I mean, if they can just open new doors in the Webway they could pretty much just immediately appear anywhere they want in as many numbers as they want
[0:42:42] ignisglaciem: if I had a nickel for every time I accidentally released a primarch
[0:42:42] CoolafEvan: Give me Fulgrim
[0:42:44] Heroically_Average: Russel Crowe next?
[0:42:46] Benersan: Maybe Corax?
[0:42:47] Fipse: Khan
[0:42:49] ansonhax: Kremlo is the secret weapon that Vashtorr is looking for!
[0:42:49] from_somewhere: Is there any 'aftermath' stuff?
[0:42:50] ManicMolesa: naw it'll be corax
[0:42:51] MahonsTV: VULKAN LIVES. STOMP. STOMP
[0:42:52] Petranomicon: Hes gonna go into the webway and jagatai will be waiting for him
[0:42:53] TheAatar: Khan and redo Dark Eldar
[0:42:59] SST_2_0: Stole a bone, Russ wakes
[0:42:59] EsotericFish: I kind of like the idea that whenever Chaos wins, it wakes up something to counter them
[0:42:59] AurorGlow4698: dreadnought Ferrus Manus
[0:43:04] SixTonTitan: VULKAN LIVES [STOMP STOMP]
[0:43:08] CommonButPosh: Jaghatai Khan would be amazing
[0:43:09] from_somewhere: Pacman
[0:43:12] hazari13: There was also that tease of that inquisitor at the end of the book
[0:43:16] dave7118: LUL
[0:43:18] pils723: Bring back Ferrus. If we're not explain how people come back that'll be funny
[0:43:20] ShiningLlama: Screw it, bring back old Metal Hands
[0:43:21] afeeney959: The khan isn't marketable enough I don't think
[0:43:23] LTKiinG: it's an ever running series of wacky races
[0:43:24] Oathforge: It's Rainbow Road from Mario
[0:43:26] Juravil: AUTOMATICO
[0:43:26] chironicle: KEKW
[0:43:27] ansonhax: Does the Khan have a jetbike or normal bike?
[0:43:28] geekaylee: Ferrus Manus Robocop 2 style dread would be coll
[0:43:32] lord_dain_denta: They are going to use it to open a Web way portal to a star and funnel the Tyrants that way, that is my guess
[0:43:32] SamWise2450: Tron but its the Khan
[0:43:33] SuperCaffeineDude: Sanguin gets eaten by nids and become kerrigan from starcraft
[0:43:33] from_somewhere: Jaghatai is just a ghost from pacman
[0:43:35] DomunDomunDomun: Honestly it probably IS like that.
[0:43:37] AbsurdityMatrix: My framerate! Ahhh!
[0:43:38] notangusmcsix: Who's gonna be a Games Night member?
[0:43:39] SmellyFishHandsDurian: I imagine it as a Scooby Doo hallway scene
[0:43:44] AurorGlow4698: @ansonhax several of each for sure
[0:43:46] mroceanflower: Jetbike Centaur Kahn for 11th edition?
[0:43:49] SonicShrubbery: Corax and Lorgar eavPray
[0:43:56] Xanthanarium_: But Ben, what about the sitcom-esque situation of Imperium Secundus V2 with the Lion, Roboute, and Sanguinius' ghost all fighting about what to do with the Imperium?
[0:44:01] EsotericFish: Bring back freaky Corvus!
[0:44:04] Diamon_Boots: Rad races in Commorragh
[0:44:10] Xanthanarium_: Wouldn't that be great?
[0:44:13] nerdcave_justin: I like the idea of Russ and Isha returning at the same time. Progress the imperium story and the eldar
[0:44:16] sirpickleboy: we've had a sever lack of orks
[0:44:17] ManicMolesa: trapped in 10,000 years in GTA Races, no prox-bombs
[0:44:20] Patricius_R: What did farsight have to do with this?
[0:44:25] EllbowsDeep: they did him dirty
[0:44:29] SST_2_0: Ghaz being awesome doesn't sell marines
[0:44:34] dave7118: waht?
[0:44:39] Dsungaripterus: @Patricius_R He was there too! Somewhere
[0:44:39] ansonhax: ??? How
[0:44:43] osici: good thing he's got the emperor's shield
[0:45:03] ansonhax: Does he throw his three little buddies in the way
[0:45:04] EllbowsDeep: the emperors shield is trash as well
[0:45:05] sirpickleboy: They went the complete opposite direction
[0:45:06] SixTonTitan: Though, is he tuned for 10th Ed rules we don't have yet?
[0:45:09] from_somewhere: Who cares he's going to have new rules in a month
[0:45:10] osici: pretty clear why the emperor didn't want it
[0:45:11] hazari13: Well he may be able to join a squad of units in the next edition for protection
[0:45:12] ansonhax: Well the Emperor's Shield didn't work against Horus so....
[0:45:13] claimtrooper: it's a decorative shield, made of plaster
[0:45:14] ManicMolesa: Lionel Jonson is kinda a chump
[0:45:28] Manxy: Does he loose to Farsite because if he looses to Tau that is hilarious
[0:45:30] RoblolGames: The shield is a red hearing. The Emporer never used it
[0:45:31] MahonsTV: It is a throwable shield
[0:45:33] EsotericFish: Yeah, he might be tuned against 10th ed
[0:45:34] Dsungaripterus: The intern did the stats
[0:45:36] Heroically_Average: Lame-l Jonson
[0:45:36] hazari13: Maybe he will be able to join units of blade guard
[0:45:37] benjambles: @SixTonTitan that would be pointless, they're indexing the whole lot.
[0:45:40] settle3m: He's got the spine of a pensioner
[0:45:41] geekaylee: Emps didn't need a good shield though, he's practically a god, so the shield is decorative
[0:45:47] Sazzaran: helloo, did I miss anything big?
[0:45:48] crackhammr: they know noone actually has the model
[0:45:51] Cindipool: They heard about this thing called "balance", still working out how to use it properly.
[0:46:00] from_somewhere: Might have been spooked to make stuff broken since Votann
[0:46:01] KuroShishi_Art: less winging for a buff than a nerf
[0:46:02] VoynichArchitect: wait... are they using windows 11?
[0:46:08] Krolose: Big E was a wizard. Who ever heard of a wizard with a shield?
[0:46:09] Dsungaripterus: @Sazzaran Just some 'news' about Arks of Omen
[0:46:18] claimtrooper: sadge
[0:46:25] sirpickleboy: @settle3m True, no stasis field or milk for 10,000 years will do that to yah
[0:46:26] ansonhax: So always charge the Lion?
[0:46:28] Benersan: Well done GW

[0:46:43] ansonhax: That feels counter intuitive
[0:46:46] Manxy: They already have dumb rock paper sizzers way of ignoring the wound cap
[0:46:56] ansonhax: Shouldn't people be running away from him and his sword
[0:46:58] Dsungaripterus: You could proxy though
[0:47:01] Dsungaripterus: With a lion
[0:47:01] from_somewhere: Don't even trip
[0:47:01] Cindipool: Is 40K Lion flimsier than Heresy Lion?
[0:47:04] claimtrooper: old news !
[0:47:04] Rabdar: yeah buddy
[0:47:06] Diamon_Boots: To be fair he IS quite old
[0:47:07] SixTonTitan: Why even release rules for him then, is my question
[0:47:10] Rabdar: new base sizes
[0:47:14] SST_2_0: Lol sounds like they were trying to make him a Lance knight
[0:47:15] Dsungaripterus: New bases sizes! boupheYay
[0:47:20] Ex_Libris85: rip all my 20mm bases, ill have to get movement trays
[0:47:24] ansonhax: @SixTonTitan Otherwise they can't sell the model I suppose
[0:47:27] Manxy: anyone who has damage cant be negated ignores the wound cap
[0:47:37] claimtrooper: how dare they ?
[0:47:46] hazari13: Makes sense tbh
[0:47:47] Benersan: Square bases?
[0:47:57] tectonicbg: yeah it was
[0:47:58] Wise_Crak: have Tom and Ben heard that their favourite power rangers bad guy snizzard is back in the new 30th anniversary episode????
[0:48:00] SketchThisWave: yeah it was horrendous
[0:48:01] dave7118: yes that was a pain
[0:48:02] from_somewhere: Ranking sucked
[0:48:05] Jammiy: if they rank up better its a good idea
[0:48:08] tectonicbg: squads of 40 clanrats
[0:48:08] antecave: skaven tails and spears, urgh
[0:48:16] claimtrooper: old figures will need new bases .
[0:48:17] Nummi_: The lizardmen were the worst because of their hunch and tails

[0:48:56] Ex_Libris85: yeah my Undead army is not getting rebased LUL ill just buy new trays
[0:49:04] Cindipool: Glue the bigger base under the smaller one.
[0:49:07] SST_2_0: Why not just a 5mm rim?
[0:49:08] DomunDomunDomun: Someone's already done 3d printable movement trays for that.
[0:49:10] Jammiy: thats what they say in the article, just use movement trays
[0:49:11] claimtrooper: big boys
[0:49:14] Commander_Jack: LUL
[0:49:15] from_somewhere: They say in the article they're going to release special movement trays.
[0:49:16] hazari13: They say to use new movement trays
[0:49:25] Lanyro: They recommend movement trays for old models so you don't have to rebase iirc
[0:49:27] benjambles: new IG are 1mm taller, Kasrkin are 2-3m though
[0:49:36] sirpickleboy: Yeah and if they want to sell the new models they have to make them bigger
[0:49:39] benjambles: they're much skinnier though
[0:49:40] Cetsuo: they said movement trays is good enough instead of rebasing
[0:49:49] benjambles: I've got plenty of old and new
[0:49:50] Nspector_Spacetime: the traitor guard though are about the same size as old cadians
[0:49:54] Tureallious: They're totally going to inflate the sizes

[0:51:38] lamashdeux: Catachans were nicknamed "Baby Ogryns" because they were so hench.
[0:51:42] LTKiinG: turns out the death of cadia was a good thing, look how healthier in shape their guardsmen are!
[0:51:42] Jammiy: cadia must have been high gravity, now it's gone they can get taller
[0:51:43] Nspector_Spacetime: not big enough
[0:51:50] Wise_Crak: have Tom and Ben heard that their favourite power rangers bad guy snizzard is back in the new 30th anniversary episode????
[0:51:54] hazari13: They might just make them better proportions.

[0:55:29] Dsungaripterus: The thing that always put me off Tomb Kings 10 years ago, was the skellies
[0:55:29] from_somewhere: I'm worried it will scupper the game if they do that
[0:55:29] LTKiinG: they look like they're having a good laugh
[0:55:32] benjambles: They've all got rickets
[0:55:34] Thirianna: There's no way they would print old sculpts.

[0:56:05] afeeney959: I collected those skeletons in primary school... I'm turning 30 soon. It can't be the same models
[0:56:07] Cindipool: Upgrade kit for modern skellies, maybe?
[0:56:08] Leoghann: In the article you just showed it states that new models are more dynamic and that's why the bases get bigger
[0:56:09] Ex_Libris85: try 30 LUL
[0:56:11] hazari13: I doubt they would.

[0:57:16] voltzzzzzz36: Why did Tomb Kings even keep their skeletons back in Fantasy when Vampire Counts got a new kit they made into Tomb Guard?
[0:57:18] ArhTolth: 2002 i think
[0:57:21] horsewithwings: horsewithwings subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 125 months, currently on a 125 month streak! Oh yeah, these came out when I subscribed.
