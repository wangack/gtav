[9:01:19] Firehead94: @zenya yeah thats going to me along the lines of server limits. They pay attention to what the average queue and playtime is of the players and allow/deny apps based on that. Best time to apply is probably at the beginning of a sub cycle or during the "off months" when the servers are so heavily populated. Its also good to start a char on public and get to know the game/people as they do recruit from there when needing specific things like police/med and other gov overseen jobs

[9:07:51] bigcountry555: anyone ever notice cornwood always uses the furthest door in the carpool from where the car was parked to leave the carpool lol
[9:07:52] Totikki: he isnt really wrong
[9:07:52] holyknightfran: his reasoning block people rp
[9:07:53] Brakon: Think he has a point
[9:07:53] xTiLkx: hes right
[9:07:54] LamePuf: it is true, waiting 5 days to be picked up once is paint
[9:07:54] holyknightfran: imo
[9:07:54] madhatterui: he's 100%
[9:07:54] DazedenConfused: hes not wrong in the sense more FTOs are needed
[9:07:54] driver1036: He may be right
[9:07:55] bluej255: FTO problem
[9:07:55] GILx87: So… he doesn’t want to hire anyone?
[9:07:56] funkie: Everyone start from somewhere but they need to be handheld
[9:07:56] MahanGM: FREEDOM SNEAKERS KKona
[9:07:56] BerryG_333: Duncan hasn't been in PD to know how things will work best
[9:07:57] Athbreith: HOLY SHIT WHAT
[9:07:57] Toastedgamer03: like this is literally how training is irl
[9:07:58] claptil: He's right about Ftos not taking them
[9:07:58] Haffsack: i thinks he isnt open to actually training new people
[9:07:59] Silvertap: They will evetually get the gist of things, if they really want the job
[9:07:59] heartsonlysoren: If you don't follow through he could be right
[9:08:00] alpine_ibex2: KKonaW nice boots
[9:08:00] squirtlehermit: shrujj it's tough to bring in so many green at once but a few at a time is good
[9:08:03] soggey_waffel: he’s got a point
[9:08:03] timpreston187: he is so neurotic
[9:08:03] brikbeans: no im confused what does he mean
[9:08:03] codysucks: he’s right tbh
[9:08:04] abadhorse: you need more meat
[9:08:04] Sorrin_Markov: NFTs and now sneakers made in china…
[9:08:04] quartercabin: Duncaning I gave slacks a list of my friends to hire last week and he hires noobs... wtf
[9:08:04] zellitan: he has a good point but the problem is nothing will change without all three captians being on the same page
[9:08:04] LHaxorP: yea but thats how you find out if a new person really wants to do it @EsfandTV
[9:08:04] claptil: Retention is the main issue
[9:08:05] RicoLoco52: still not enough people to turn down recruits for being green
[9:08:06] rohnj: like he is right but u need cadets right now
[9:08:06] shmeeso: Cadets do get sick of waiting
[9:08:06] throat_pump: they definitely needed to hire fto material people before greens
[9:08:07] Vengy: I mean it sort of happened already so he's not wrong
[9:08:07] bonkvpg: i feel like it just depends on each person
[9:08:07] TheUberDork: Duncaning
[9:08:08] comrade_raptor: you have to suck before you get good….lol
[9:08:08] lopololoko: he wants it to be to easy and not actually train people up
[9:08:08] iSplitSeas: invest your time in new people. mold them to be better
[9:08:09] nhqnhq: Duncaning I still don't know what he is trying to convey
[9:08:10] jeffrey778: it depends on the people that want to train as well
[9:08:12] MaSTerSOra701: its does block a lot of newer people to RP as a police officer
[9:08:13] DezalbM: i agree with both points lol
[9:08:13] w111iam1: Both are right but it's necessary to find new people at the end  of the day
[9:08:13] Zakuras: Being green isnt a bad thing, if theyre are willing to learn
[9:08:13] Toastbane: But its not up to you 2, so it's kinda deal what they throw your way
[9:08:14] minothorx: He has a point but what you said is right people do improve
[9:08:14] Tamaroc: cadets should be in a rotation not based on experience and skill
[9:08:15] furious_Trance: i think you need some fresh blood, otherwise u r going to run out of ppl. but not so many as to overload FTOs
[9:08:15] tiden5725: good personalities and cultrue is always better than reguarless of their skill level
[9:08:15] PsychoJoker: Duncaning im cooking but being quiet
[9:08:15] Cabs_Gaming: you need folks to facilitate new ideas training is always shitty but you cant count on this force to always be there all the time
[9:08:16] LoudPackNoReefa: he’s wrong how is it a waste of time when they get it eventually
[9:08:17] horsegirldotca: people just need to be aware they might not get picked up as much for being as green i they wanna stay
[9:08:17] Orbilion: Stare yeah
[9:08:18] Cloaked_in_Fiction: Isn't duncans point is that the FTOs are getting burnt out so that causes cadets to get bored waiting in limbo?
[9:08:18] Angelumortis: not completely wrong, but they have the potential to be better, and does the PD have the flexibility to not have more people?
[9:08:18] InvictoNZ: A is a problem and B is a problem, just do it
[9:08:20] Vikairius: He is right about there not being enough FTOS for the greenhorns
[9:08:20] Agony099: Duncaning imagine the color wheel
[9:08:21] Shonuff_: that's what happened to bonnie, she almost burned out during cadet phase
[9:08:21] a2th3vi: If a couple out of the bunch become solid police officers then you've done your job
[9:08:21] guilt_: he's not wrong but he's overthinking the shit again
[9:08:24] sirsalem13: Wasn’t Duncan an FTO who never trained anyone?
[9:08:25] Austin7x3: you cant gatekeep the PD
[9:08:29] iSplitSeas: he's clearly never been a leader
[9:08:32] ComplexPandaSinger: but everyone was green
[9:08:33] Ieestring: this chat Chatting
[9:08:35] soggey_waffel: but the FTO’s arnt there yet
[9:08:35] Toastedgamer03: like ftos needs a day off so they don't get burned out sure but they signed up for this KEKW
[9:08:37] Alpha___0_0: Duncaning
[9:08:37] Firehead94: @EsfandTV everyone who has half a brain should atleast be given the opportunity even if they dont seem too great out the gate if you want to find the diamonds in the rough
[9:08:38] EPiQ: I mean, you have to essentially zerg training. You need lots of cadets to fail out and lots to be persistent...so you can eventually get more officers and more FTOs. There's no magic solution to "lots of trained officers"
[9:08:39] holyknightfran: his reasoning is bad for rp imo
[9:08:40] skinnylegend000: an all A team PD all the time is boring content.
[9:08:41] Xanisselis: FTO who ain't willing to train new candidates are they are really wanna be fto
[9:08:42] RexPappa: too cynical, you never know when someone is going to step up.
[9:08:43] itsRickus: Then they shouldn't FTO.
[9:08:44] Maz0hyst: Duncaning Listen Cornwood we can't hire someone that has a better mustache than me. I need to be the only one cooking
[9:08:45] TexasToast77: thats kinda how my work is rn
[9:08:47] uboozeru: I hate when people do this how do you expect people to have experience if you don't give them experience
[9:08:49] Xierany: It does sound like a good idea to FTO green cadets together with a more experienced one, instead of having an FTO solo train a green one
[9:08:50] TexanRampage92: kinda if they arent dedicated
[9:08:51] soggey_waffel: you need to get more fto
[9:08:51] dudemanbroo: @EsfandTV There needs to be a balance of new and experienced people coming in.
[9:08:51] StreamElements: 22% OFF YOUR PURCHASE AT GAMERSUPPS.GG when you use code "OTK"! NOW UNTIL 2/9! GET ON NOW, GIT!
[9:08:52] nabstonekido: Shift 2 got a lot of FTO
[9:08:52] Lucid_Jaydee: Yall dont have enough FTOs to have enough greenhorns
[9:08:53] Agony099: FTO-wood mhm
[9:08:54] Ieestring: Chatting holy
[9:08:59] DismalShark: 4.0 PD's standard is so high, it's going to be hard to recruit "good" people
[9:09:03] CuIdra: Both points have merits but until you try it like this, how will you know if it fails or not
[9:09:05] LoudPackNoReefa: you could ask Duncan the color of the sky and he would answer grass
[9:09:05] Tamaroc: sounds like hes gatekeeping be cause people dont have a lot of experience coming out of the gate
[9:09:07] Alpha___0_0: Duncaning Listen Cornwood
[9:09:10] Wintyer2: gota cut the joeys sooner
[9:09:11] LoudPackNoReefa: LUL
[9:09:11] ItsLucuss: Having a group of complete newbies will be good because it'll give you a base level of how long it takes to train a group from scratch
[9:09:16] BeerRun204: When is the last.time.Duncan actually patrolled and made.an arrest?
[9:09:17] holyknightfran: ???
[9:09:18] brikbeans: HELL WEEK
[9:09:18] tdport92: Don't let FTO choose who they train so no one gets left behind. Make it an order list
[9:09:20] RicoLoco52: having issues like this possibly the impetus of good change
[9:09:21] MahanGM: Duncaning  SHEESH
[9:09:22] DeoNone: yep
[9:09:22] mrwriii: Duncaning im so turned off
[9:09:28] holyknightfran: they must learn tho if they dont they can leave rp wise lol
[9:09:29] panchoxidado: to be in shift 2 you need to start in shift 1
[9:09:31] Angelumortis: can you be so selective if you're already spread thin
[9:09:32] Agony099: @BeerRun204 while cornwoods asleep LUL
[9:09:32] Dantesaur: gates open come on in
[9:09:33] Zakuras: Throw them in the deep end, see who floats to the top
[9:09:33] HeyMeghan: Duncan literally quit FTO
[9:09:34] iSplitSeas: expecting people to be 100% at the beginning of recruitment is a bad standard
[9:09:34] ToyLetTreat: just higher the cop twitch chatters they know all the call outs
[9:09:36] holyknightfran: I don't see the problem xD
[9:09:36] lexipro13: this is really relatable when i worked at an amusement park.
[9:09:36] ChocolateMassage: so whats his solution ?
[9:09:36] heartsonlysoren: gotta dedicate FTO time
[9:09:37] jedi_sage_: Well we cant expect to only find cops with experience
[9:09:38] claptil: He's trying to stop discouragement
[9:09:38] Toastbane: @tdport92 FTO's burn out fast
[9:09:38] squirtlehermit: you do need new people tho. probably just not so many at once that it's overwhelming
[9:09:42] DeLosFritos: FTO has always been like that.
[9:09:43] fracturedseas: youre only gonna have so many cops if you only hire past cops too though
[9:09:44] shmeeso: Isn't that his point somewhat? Everyone feels like they don't have the time and energy
[9:09:47] w111iam1: You should use them as assistants
[9:09:48] Sad_Duckies: new to esfands stream but i love your character!
[9:09:51] Toastedgamer03: @Tamaroc i think it is more of this server is full of streamers who don't realize how boring training is but needed and they signed up for something they don't really like KEKW
[9:09:52] Totikki: he want more ppl that know their stuff first and newer later it sounds like, which kinda make sense
[9:09:52] Jrey000: @Tamaroc yea he is not gatekeeping he wants it so when the gates open they can have fun and actully be able to learn
[9:09:53] AardvarkAndDedication: Duncaning He's really trying to focus on finding the right people I think
[9:09:56] jukla12: FirstTimeChatter

[9:10:39] ToyLetTreat: eh need some new blood man
[9:10:39] Toastedgamer03: but yeah ftos do need a break once in a while so hopefully you can get some new ftos in a couple months so people can take proper breaks

[9:11:25] iSplitSeas: anyone with a brain could see you have to be a good leader to recruit and mold people to be good enough for the role
[9:11:28] shikari07: I think they want people who have not been in a pd before
[9:11:36] HeyMeghan: omg Duncan is actually on duty for once.

[9:13:43] thesonofbean: @xsonofjechtx no one cares
[9:13:50] Zenysa: @grimbellz make sure that if you go thru the process of applying and give the $30 as part of your app, that you write a really, really good profile for your RP character. make it lengthy. if they reject you, then you don't get your $30 back and gotta wait 30 days +$30 more to apply again

[9:28:27] Xierany: I wouldn't say those 4 doors are in good faith, it's more about stealing something available enough with 4 doors. And they want faster vehicles for swaps so you start off with the CVPIs

[9:29:57] RonJon: @xolision 2 vehicles just shouldn't be allowed it allows for too much
[9:29:57] ihannibal: @Neekapkilla they chased 1 car so wats the difference
[9:29:58] ikky___: @van_1912 they got nothing. It was all scuffed

[9:30:08] giggles5502: There job scuffed out
[9:30:09] Mindhysteria: at the start of 3.0 it was 4
[9:30:09] HiHauru: what exactly is that?
[9:30:11] Aitchemdee: you have to have 6 people for that job can’t even start it without 6
[9:30:11] ToyLetTreat: @Aitchemdee technically they dont HAVE to do anything
[9:30:14] Creative145: whats the rule of 6?
[9:30:14] Sup3rU: 5 it is ok
[9:30:14] ben_v_art: yea too much for the early game
[9:30:14] MysticCasey: Classic Crims have it better
[9:30:15] BLazOR_Prime: and not even enough cops to chaise both cars
[9:30:16] Xierany: @Xurkan They don't have endless officers on duty. 2 cars is way too powerful atm
[9:30:17] cjohno20: PD was supposed to be capable by now tbh
[9:30:17] Pee_aRe: i rather yall give them a 6 mag dumps each
[9:30:17] mavericks312: if they were gonna do 6 they should have let you use lethal sooner
[9:30:17] captain_araujo: 5 is perfect i think
[9:30:19] Descrete1: I think rule of 5 is better.
[9:30:19] MahanGM: should  be 4 crim 4 cop
[9:30:20] minich4rmander: @EsfandTV cant coordinate who chases what with 5 vehicles?
[9:30:21] cboys41: @SubDemon huh?
[9:30:21] jdstaun: they shouldve reset it to 4
[9:30:23] hachi86roku_: drive better mayb
[9:30:23] tyler24199: Sup
[9:30:23] budogorilla: It made sense for the big heists in 3.0 they're not there yet in 4.0
[9:30:24] Gachiguru: crims are progressing extremely fast
[9:30:25] Antttsss: the less the easier
[9:30:28] Antttsss: for them
[9:30:28] TakeAChance: Why 5?
[9:30:29] SharkzGG_: rule of 6 was great when it came out in 3.0 but it should have been reverted for 4.0 start
[9:30:29] LoudPackNoReefa: are there 6 seaters in the server still?
[9:30:29] bart_ruckel: they never robbed anything anyways
[9:30:30] Xurkan: @Xurkan So you have to bring the whole PD because they are entitled to 2 vehicles?
[9:30:30] Toastedgamer03: they probably thought they shouldn't go lower because 3.0 for a while was 6, but that did mess up progression
[9:30:30] Starscream1379: That’s fine, but that’s a admin thing. Cops trying to limit it doesn’t make sense
[9:30:32] cjohno20: PD was supposed to be bigger by now
[9:30:32] OkaAnt_: the problem is lack of pd
[9:30:33] simplynonexistent: true
[9:30:34] logiczxd: pd down bad lmao
[9:30:34] giftmecase: @Aitchemdee That is not true
[9:30:35] icephrogg: they didnt get anything from the robbery lol they were scuffed
[9:30:36] teknowledgy404: yeah 6 should really have been just really big jobs
[9:30:37] Chaoszero_goc: cops just need to hire more people and stop slow rolling
[9:30:37] Antttsss: KEKW
[9:30:39] Cagz070: should be 4 with low cop numbers
[9:30:39] immunecaptain: nah the problem is its a 4 man heist and they are bringing 6
[9:30:39] woolfdesign: Has the crim progression been slower than previous times?
[9:30:42] simplynonexistent: and like pilot license and classes and shit
[9:30:42] LoudPackNoReefa: 4 is better to watch too
[9:30:43] LawarBali: can you RPG the copter?
[9:30:43] azncheesy: Bikes will be first
[9:30:43] trebekcansuckit: agreed
[9:30:43] trez1199: the car u chased u guys lost in like 3 mins tho lol
[9:30:44] Voidz_xx: Or let 2 people in the trunk
[9:30:44] gatsymphony00: surely people will be civil when PD gets OP shit soone Clueless
[9:30:44] DemonDam: they technically dont need 6 to complete the heist. They can have 4 inside and 2 on standby
[9:30:44] PsychoJoker: @dwezal no but honestly hes only out 10k in all reality. Regardless the pay to them was 10k because he wanted the audio fixed in the PD the dispatch just thought he had stolen the 10k back
[9:30:44] RicoLoco52: 5 can fit in a single vehicle
[9:30:46] jollypnda: you need more available units and way better parrelling
[9:30:46] sssacrifixe: you still lost the one car you were after tho
[9:30:47] Firehead94: The only thing that went slow was the PD, there were no controls on the other things to make the crims or other events slow
[9:30:47] OkaAnt_: 6 is fine if u have more than 8 cops at ttime
[9:30:47] shadow__rain: well respectfully most of the owners main crims so it makes sense
[9:30:48] nimbleop: only allow one car free passage??
[9:30:50] puppietreats: @aitchemdee that’s such bs lol, yuno did a robbery with 2 other people
[9:30:50] Laura_Palmer_: wrong, rule of 6 always worked fine
[9:30:51] flash9807: @EsfandTV xqc said yall should already have helis
[9:30:51] d4rk3nergy: but didn't you guys were following only 1 car?
[9:30:52] w111iam1: Duncaning
[9:30:52] lookachef: helicopter should already be a thing
[9:30:52] DezalbM: the heli aint happening trust
[9:30:53] captain_araujo: 5 is good , 4 people can rob and 1 for getaway
[9:30:54] LogicWeasel: the PD staffing numbers just too damn low.
[9:30:54] MahanGM: Duncaning
[9:30:54] Maz0hyst: Duncaning SHEESH Lemme cook
[9:30:54] Creative145: whats the rule of 6 chat?
[9:30:55] Van_1912: council said PD has to pay for it.   goodluck
[9:30:56] headsetofdoom_: Duncaning
[9:30:58] TwistzZera: 3.0 have 6 cuz there are 20 cop on duty, but 4.0 not KEKW
[9:30:58] cshproxy: heli is definitely needed with the current state of the pd imo
[9:30:59] slymox: Duncaning "Let me ask you something"
[9:30:59] Hdotkayy: @immunecaptain you can have 6 in a group on the app for a reason
[9:31:00] MahanGM: Duncaning  so let me continue
[9:31:00] god__turkey: if the captains would stop firing the entire police force
[9:31:02] HeyMeghan: oh my goddedddd
[9:31:02] Mr_Mikah: Or you need 8 cop vehicles at every heist
[9:31:03] trez1199: even if it was one car they wouldve gotten away in 2 minutes anyway LUL
[9:31:03] captain_araujo: 6 is too much
[9:31:03] BrainOnAutopilot: Duncaning let me ask a you a question
[9:31:04] P_Herbo24: PD was probably supposed to be more equipped by now yeah ?
[9:31:04] Chaoszero_goc: 6 is fine, hire more cops
[9:31:04] fishnchips333: honestly once dna is taken chases and stuff wont nmatter. just gonna be easy pd wins
[9:31:04] suijay: @icephrogg they will get reimbursed
[9:31:05] zeltaxx18: theres a shit ton of cops theres no reason you cant chase 2 cars simultaneously
[9:31:08] quroxll: is it really the crims fault for the cops not following one of the cars LUL LUL
[9:31:08] omn___i: essaying
[9:31:09] DeoNone: tyler peters u did
[9:31:09] lestermatthew: you can't bring in a hili for a laundromat I don't think slax will go for that
[9:31:10] tsotmo: Duncaning
[9:31:10] Esbjornnn: Duncaning
[9:31:11] giggles5502: It sucks that there job scuffed out
[9:31:15] Onyo1337: @Laura_Palmer_ not with a new PD lol
[9:31:15] jennyindisguise: Duncaning lemme ask u somthin. Do you got 4 hours to talk?
[9:31:15] docshaayy: I feel like when your actively cuffing someone and there is a car parked next to you waiting for them to break cuffs and hop in other officers should be shooting tires.. no?
[9:31:18] Xierany: @Laura_Palmer_ 2nd half of 3.0 yes, but not in 4.0
[9:31:21] BerryG_333: Would you rather have 4 on scene + 2 for chase?
[9:31:21] taraannee: progression is faster w 6 imo bc its impossible to catch both cars, crims get away every time & progress faster than pd
[9:31:22] OreynXD: Duncaning so anyway I was sayin
[9:31:25] Xurkan: 5 is the sweet spot 4 robbers 1  getaway driver
[9:31:26] U62charlie: I mean, Cops don’t have limits on how many they have sooo
[9:31:27] miketwng: Duncaning but you dont wanna
[9:31:31] evilmnkey4: oops
[9:31:31] UtmostAxe: UtmostAxe subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months! 29 months with the GOAT CORNMAN
[9:31:33] PsychoJoker: Duncaning we are cooking together cornwood
[9:31:35] carefreespreee: does duncan do actual pd work ever?
[9:31:37] DESHAWNTE: @MahanGM i wish but that will never happen
[9:31:38] Gachiguru: @P_Herbo24 its hard to keep people the SOPs are rough
[9:31:39] w111iam1: Cop cars are too slow compared to civ ones
[9:31:42] Laura_Palmer_: @Laura_Palmer_ cool, then hire more cops and a heli
[9:31:43] flash9807: @docshaayy no they wouldnt do that in real life
[9:31:43] Toastedgamer03: @DemonDam yeah but then that leads to less things crims can do for their plans and can piss off people
[9:31:45] UtmostAxe: oh i forgot too, WideHardo
[9:31:46] poolking420: ya thats weird
[9:31:46] xtopspotx: it was in good faith
[9:31:47] MahanGM: @DESHAWNTE yeh xdd
[9:31:50] TAKICHIHOS_luv: 6 people dont fit in a 4 seater
[9:31:50] not_uniq: 1 hostage = 1 negotiation
[9:31:50] rikaus69: Driving skill of crims is just better clearly
[9:31:50] DarkFalconTV: look im a crim watcher but the server needs to implement 1 car policy in those situations
[9:31:58] Van_1912: the "hostage" is a crim and part of it anyways
[9:31:59] TakeAChance: @docshaayy Nah they have a force matrix. They're not allowed to use excessive force
[9:32:00] DevilDogTash: that depends on how many cops
[9:32:00] Toastedgamer03: better just to have it 4 man groups unless it is a huge huge heist
[9:32:00] KillerKolsch: yeah but you only chased one car and still lost it
[9:32:01] x_Gordo: well all the cops chased 1 car and they still got away .... so 2 cars didnt matter LUL
[9:32:01] LogicWeasel: make them bring a bigger car?
[9:32:02] EhBud: They gonna get away in a bus lol
[9:32:06] jdotno: In this case it wouldn't have mattered cause they lost you anyways
[9:32:06] AardvarkAndDedication: Limo getaway tune'
[9:32:06] Starscream1379: are there 6 seaters available?
[9:32:08] squirtlehermit: like an suv or something?
[9:32:09] LogicWeasel: they'll need an escalade
[9:32:09] RicoLoco52: usually requires 3 cop cars to box a single vehicle
[9:32:10] aleevip: cop cars are faster lol what
[9:32:11] m4rshan: maybe 6 is too much for a laundramat
[9:32:12] SkyMason21: @Starscream1379 no
[9:32:12] Stinkytool: still don't make any sense
[9:32:12] Toastedgamer03: but too late to reverse the rule of 6 without backlash
[9:32:13] You_wont_no_balls: @x_Gordo fax OMEGALAUGHING
[9:32:13] lovenapkin: 2 vehicles will be the new meta...
[9:32:14] jojosplug: @Van_1912 that's against the rules of the server ur clueless lmao
[9:32:15] trez1199: i dont think they use 6 to use it to their advantage its more so they dont wanna kick ppl out of the group
[9:32:17] Hdotkayy: @Van_1912 they found him on the street what are you talking about OMEGALUL
[9:32:18] BerryG_333: Back to rule of 4 on scene seems like a must
[9:32:18] fcdiego_75: just drive better
[9:32:18] DemonDam: @Toastedgamer03 Well they can still do the job with 6. Just have 2 on the outside on standby. They dont need 6 inside the laundromat
[9:32:20] taraannee: @aleevip no they arent
[9:32:21] ihannibal: you all chased 1 car anyway no?
[9:32:21] maestro__21: I just think cops aren't good enough 🤷‍♂️
[9:32:21] Datursa: @Starscream1379 no
[9:32:22] Maz0hyst: @aleevip They're not actually KEKW
[9:32:22] cloudy_charles: or the fact you stink at driving
[9:32:22] Gachiguru: you need 12 cops to 6 crims
[9:32:23] zemondombie: just make them take 2 hostages
[9:32:23] lestermatthew: a lot of jobs require more than four
[9:32:25] Alaciya: I like 6
[9:32:26] U62charlie: just need to lead and organize, draw up a SOP on how to handle 2 cars
[9:32:28] minich4rmander: cant chase 2 cars with 6 cars Sadge
[9:32:29] pooped: yeah the heist allows them to enter 6 people so not much for them to do
[9:32:29] Xierany: @DarkFalconTV Worst take, lol. Even with 3 cars per vehicle the crims win most of the time
[9:32:30] Crazyoldfool: @aleevip tf are you smoking? LUL
[9:32:31] Chaoszero_goc: hire. more. cops.
[9:32:32] TylerWootten: I think they need a lot of people for it
[9:32:32] Usahi_Light: dundee did with with 2 and no hostage lol
[9:32:32] holyknightfran: true
[9:32:33] nlwatcher: they called you a senior. did you get a promotion? or did they mean by age
[9:32:35] anaIbeadbatista_: respectfully they only chased one car and lost him in 30 seconds.
[9:32:35] EZScuderia: DonoWall
[9:32:36] mrperson1234: Maybe force one person to be on a bike?
[9:32:36] w111iam1: It's too late
[9:32:37] BerryG_333: + 2 with a chase
[9:32:38] MahanGM: ignoring duncan D:
[9:32:38] L_a_z_o_r: DonoWall
[9:32:39] EPiQ: Most of the groups already ahve more than 6 anyways.
[9:32:39] LoudPackNoReefa: every car being 4 or 5 seater with rule of 6 is crazy
[9:32:40] weggeddude: That's less rp with 4
[9:32:40] Dimitris_Hc: They going to be 6 people car soon
[9:32:41] flash9807: @EsfandTV force 5 people in one car then just chase that car
[9:32:43] dankNbeans: @lovenapkin wait until they show up in three 2-seaters lol
[9:32:43] anoobmove_twitch: well then you get rid  of the free pasage or spilkes?
[9:32:44] Switchblade142: Maybe tell 2 people to leave and full search them and confiscate anything if they want to try and bring 2 vehicles that dont fit 6
[9:32:44] DevilDogTash: How many cops were there for the chase?
[9:32:45] combattingjosh: @Chaoszero_goc they are. They need more FTOS
[9:32:45] holyknightfran: esfand is a wise rper YEP
[9:32:46] imSteffin: If you swap rules now it's too late. You fuck up RP and peoples friend groups.
[9:32:46] strawberryraye: aweee booooo poor criminals having to tell 2 people no
[9:32:46] nimbleop: Then cops need a new rule then
[9:32:47] texasmade222: there is not enough 5 seaters in the city
[9:32:47] PsychoJoker: Duncaning we are talking cornwood quit paying attention to comms
[9:32:48] rubberbreaker: If the group allows 6 people I'm assuming the server admins want it at 6
[9:32:48] UtmostAxe: 4Weird not cool
[9:32:49] AardvarkAndDedication: Too late basically, or a 2 week notice for 5 maybe?
[9:32:49] KillerKolsch: @anaIbeadbatista_ this
[9:32:49] DeoNone: but they won't kick they will swap places sometimes
[9:32:50] axbob: Duncaning
[9:32:51] You_wont_no_balls: HIRE MORE COPS, STOP DAPing COPS :)
[9:32:51] dudemanbroo: 6 for a group but 4 on an active job?
[9:32:51] khrow: life isn't fair sometimes, for the health of the sever
[9:32:52] BYRDGAMING: w take
[9:32:53] WHATtheINTERROBANG: Rule of 5.5 is perfect
[9:32:53] ImStuckInATreeDud: Duncan
[9:32:53] Xurkan: why 4 or 6 and not 5, 5 makes more sense.
[9:32:55] sholland: do a box van. Gruppe 6 truck will fit 6 technically
[9:32:55] splooshtasticals: ease it onto people somehow then. Peeps must adapt
[9:32:57] shadow__rain: ooc Mr k has an 8 seater but you can’t rent or steal one often
[9:33:01] CountDrax: Why do I see others do it with less people?
[9:33:02] yo_who_asked: uhm
[9:33:02] Van_1912: they rob the same laundry 3 times a day,  why isn't a cop just sitting in there?  staking it out
[9:33:03] DarnComputer: its either 2 vehicles from the start or one person waiting with a car swap
[9:33:03] AlexanderPethrus: Just bring them a van
[9:33:03] BushWookieeGaming: Should be if they want 2 cars that’s the deal.   They can’t have no spikes or other thing to help them.
[9:33:04] avonwg: pd just needs to get their shit together and get more numbers
[9:33:05] Entropystachio: Duncaning
[9:33:06] HeyMeghan: is he dumb
[9:33:08] Gachiguru: theyll ask for 6 cars LULE
[9:33:08] PewbesSalad: who made these stupid rules anyways XQC?
[9:33:10] MaNSoN6649: So if it starts on 6 will it end on 12 AppaK
[9:33:10] TakeAChance: @docshaayy And in the context of RP, shooting could easily kill one of them or someone else.
[9:33:12] Drackaine: @EsfandTV give free passage to 2 of them with a "frisk" only for the heist stuff, then have 4 on the main pursuit and the other 2 can join in another car mid chase
[9:33:12] lestermatthew: I don't think it would ever get to three
[9:33:12] xtopspotx: they didn’t swap to be fair
[9:33:12] GoofyMaskedGoober: @Xurkan why not 10
[9:33:14] MahanGM: Duncaning  realizes the problem
[9:33:14] dankNbeans: safe passage for six motorcycles!
[9:33:14] holyknightfran: rule of 30 when? GIGACHAD
[9:33:15] UllThankMeL8R: ??
[9:33:16] yo_who_asked: how to stop crime: let it happen
[9:33:17] tsotmo: just fill the parking lot with cars
[9:33:18] EhBud: You couldn't follow 1 car whats the difference lol
[9:33:18] steez_irwin: ?
[9:33:18] lestermatthew: bring more cops easy solution
[9:33:18] jeffrey778: cant take away convenient stuff once its put in
[9:33:19] SarahFlare: just spike the second car. kekw
[9:33:19] Zenysa: they can glitch the trunk to take 2 people, right now. they just have to both go in at the same moment. the code could change to make 2 in the trunk legit, then cars fit 6
[9:33:19] ToyLetTreat: lol i need some of his weed what the hell
[9:33:19] amavadin: solution is just let them take them money and go home
[9:33:20] LogicWeasel: duncan, wtf dude
[9:33:21] cboys41: LETHIMCOOK
[9:33:21] tiden5725: can yall identify them when they are in the laundry?
[9:33:22] Esbjornnn: Duncaning
[9:33:22] pooped: @PewbesSalad they were made in 3.0
[9:33:22] m4rshan: wat?
[9:33:23] SharkzGG_: @PewbesSalad XQC has nothing to do with this LUL
[9:33:24] x_Gordo: @shadow__rain aint no one using an suv for getaway lol
[9:33:25] AlexanderPethrus: If u get them van they fit 6
[9:33:26] GoofyMaskedGoober: @holyknightfran LETHIMCOOK
[9:33:26] snoo7e: The thing is the job is intended for 8 people
[9:33:27] LogicWeasel: WHOLETHIMCOOK  duncan
[9:33:27] Mehscope: instead of 2 cars, how about 6 bikes EZ
[9:33:28] ComradeGreetingCard: they get two cars anyway if they stage a car not so far away
[9:33:28] M_R_1100: let 2 walk for free lol
[9:33:28] DESHAWNTE: @DarnComputer true
[9:33:29] Usahi_Light: @Van_1912 because they have a hostage, it doesnt really matter
[9:33:29] MysticCasey: I think he means they'll stop asking and you can get them on the technicality @EsfandTV
[9:33:30] lexipro13: yeaa
[9:33:32] Dolgovata: What a GREAT idea...
[9:33:32] khrow: @PewbesSalad nice try, it was at the end of 3.0, x wasnt even playing
[9:33:34] Laura_Palmer_: @PewbesSalad tell me you are new to nopixel without telling me KEKW
[9:33:34] yo_who_asked: WHOLETHIMCOOK
[9:33:34] combattingjosh: Duncaning something something
[9:33:35] Gachiguru: comms on chasing 6 vehicle LULE
[9:33:36] Maz0hyst: @aleevip Someone's been passing that around for some reason. But cop cars top out at like 120 with the one he's in and that's with turbo. Civ cars can max at like 140+. Cop cars are also like paper for some reason atm
[9:33:38] ogbrowniettv: does he think they will forget to ask about two cars?
[9:33:38] CuIdra: give them an inch and theyll take a mile
[9:33:38] nimbleop: 1 car per hostage
[9:33:38] m4rshan: he cant possibly think they're that guillible
[9:33:38] U62charlie: just plan who is going after what car better
[9:33:39] tabslyy: Kappa
[9:33:39] Toastedgamer03: @DemonDam i know but then you have backlash of crims being like "well this ruins rp because less things we can do, like if our group decides to go ham in there and just get in and out can't do that as well now" or whatever other thing they would complain about
[9:33:40] Agony099: 2 demands per hostage mhm
[9:33:40] Van_1912: they get all the demands they want everytime?  that seems fair.
[9:33:41] RicoLoco52: @demondam I’ve seen this at least once
[9:33:42] papus1983: The problem is also on gun fight after..4 ppl vs 10 police officers is too much
[9:33:42] eexile_: just let one person drive the one car
[9:33:43] lookachef: just don’t even chase them
[9:33:44] cboys41: WHOLETHIMCOOK
[9:33:45] Gachiguru: no they wont LULE
[9:33:48] GoofyMaskedGoober: I am in support of rule of 30 only LETHIMCOOK
[9:33:48] SharkzGG_: rule of 6 was for the Casino heist in mid 3.0
[9:33:49] splooshtasticals: Yup. that's wat im thinking
[9:33:49] tommacca26: could be worse they could be bringing 2 cars what go 190+ the cars only go 120 max
[9:33:50] EhBud: Should let one guy walk away empty handed lol
[9:33:51] Latded: yeah, give them 2 shit cars
[9:33:51] endokei: duncan having too much things in his mind
[9:33:51] ToyLetTreat: maybe they only get 1 demand
[9:33:51] TheyCallMePoki: Duncaning Just give them six cars
[9:34:00] ToyLetTreat: either 2 cars or no spikes
[9:34:01] lookachef: give them the money and lunch
[9:34:02] lestermatthew: that falls on PD though
[9:34:03] minich4rmander: has nothing to do with the cops drivin skill. thats for sure
[9:34:04] Mawkatz: Frost <3
[9:34:04] SharkzGG_: Classic frost
[9:34:04] BerryG_333: Setup spikes around second car, they can't drive it
[9:34:05] Atrix646: another weeb cop LUL
[9:34:05] juudn: Ofc they ask for 2 cars when they are 6 ppl
[9:34:06] PsychoJoker: OMEGALUL
[9:34:12] ShaneOwens0: AYAYA ?

[9:34:20] PewbesSalad: LMAO i love the responses
[9:34:21] trez1199: they kinda got fucked
[9:34:21] Toastbane: @lestermatthew It falls on who's in charge of PD
[9:34:21] DieterK: @EsfandTV shit's getting to depressing to watch, sheriff's office got denied as well
[9:34:23] kylemacs: yappin frost
[9:34:30] Chaoszero_goc: they could have had one person in that chase and they still lost the car in the chase
[9:34:32] rubberbreaker: Why would the app allow 6 people if the server didn't want 6 ?
[9:34:36] BauR: peepoShy Frost
[9:34:37] Atrix646: @existinne she speaks French,she might b French canadian
[9:34:37] coldan01: frost GIGACHAD
[9:34:38] scallopppp: The headaches for all the chases are terrible. I hope they can fix that
[9:34:39] PsychoJoker: Frost is always excited to talk to cornwood i like it
[9:34:40] Darthsayver21: shadow clone jutsu? PogChamp
[9:34:41] jeremyks9: yall should chased both cars and when one got away try to get other car if the other units didn't lose it
[9:34:41] SharkzGG_: @DieterK dont get depressed watching something :)
[9:34:42] manju3010: Hole city is  scuff
[9:34:43] DieterK: HDMI
[9:34:47] splooshtasticals: polish thy self miss NODDERS great works
[9:34:47] Waterbottels: @DieterK sheriff office officially got denied?
[9:34:48] timedoggg: @rubberbreaker meta
[9:34:48] IronRosco: Don't even know I'd u could charge robbery if they get nothing and it's scuffed lol
[9:34:49] spicyville: I think slacks has said you can’t give them 2 cars but I don’t know what he expects when there are 6 people
[9:34:50] Toastedgamer03: @DieterK did they say why it was denied?
[9:34:51] ToyLetTreat: i guess 2 demands safe passage obviously then either 2 cars or no spikes
[9:34:52] IIIIllIlll: How is that fun for crims? Basically no chase....
[9:34:53] anoobmove_twitch: Get rid of of free passge or spikes for the second car.
[9:34:54] disruptedorder: Duncan just brings the mood down
[9:34:54] d3monical: and I thought the streamer awards were cringe...
[9:34:55] imSteffin: i hate when her mic cues cause it pops for some reason
[9:34:56] greenburg22: @DixonGE1 pretty sur eit was 4 before the casino was gettin gready
[9:34:59] eexile_: what if you let 1 person drive 1 car that way he don’t have help
[9:35:01] mrperson1234: ?
[9:35:04] existinne: ahh thanks always wondered @Atrix646
[9:35:05] thebigshabam: howd laundry go i missed it
[9:35:06] U62charlie: either focus on one car or organize your officers into two squads (one for each), not hard
[9:35:06] Gachiguru: theyll never stop asking for two cars
[9:35:07] Puns_for_days: Buncha panty thiefs
[9:35:08] Vikairius: @Guielme Insane
[9:35:11] kylemacs: if you don’t give it to them they will just park one nearby
[9:35:11] splooshtasticals: hmmMeeting
[9:35:12] pinksparkly11: @Gachiguru true
[9:35:13] DESHAWNTE: they had 4 in 3.0 until they changed it to 6 ❤️
[9:35:14] BigglesVII: May have been slightly better with all single crewed cars instead of 2 in a pd car.
[9:35:14] khrow: @EsfandTV nah man they should have to use a van or something. Tell them 1 car
[9:35:17] weggeddude: 2 cars more cops
[9:35:17] taraannee: these heists are kinda weird, same every time, pd gives free passage, takes hostage, crims get away
[9:35:20] kylemacs: but you can’t leave 2 guys within a car..

[9:36:39] taraannee: i think a lot of ppl are just gone this weekend for obvious reasons...
[9:36:40] kylemacs: how do I apply
[9:36:41] Van_1912: if they get 2 cars and no spikes , safe passage...why cant PD get anything?
[9:36:43] khonco: alot of them that were good cops also got run off by "captains" cough moon2HUH
[9:36:47] lovelee___: Duncaning
[9:36:47] Toastedgamer03: @Gachiguru i think the cop progression not going well has a big part in that also

[9:37:51] SharkzGG_: @FarmirTv 20 hours

[9:38:15] Vizumn: just finished
[9:38:15] Gachiguru: Its simple, the people who play both are only gonna play crim because crim progression is too important to play two characters
[9:38:15] thebigshabam: they need to give cornwood the northern office and have him recruit people with similar personality types
[9:38:16] LogicWeasel: Sadge  this PD has no freakin numbers
[9:38:16] dotslashdata: duncan campaigning for undersherrif

[9:38:21] StreamElements: NO META GAMING. If you do so, don't be surprised when you get BANNED.
[9:38:21] U62charlie: use the ICS system…… split into two task forces - one for each car, instead of having all cars on one person…
[9:38:21] HeyMeghan: the problem is Duncan thinks his solution is the only solution
[9:38:21] funkie: 1 person per car 6 cars for laundry to be able to box 2 cars
[9:38:23] kylemacs: @taraannee no just liaison but him and crane are doing an investigation into PD issues with not having enough ppl on duty and staff
[9:38:23] BigglesVII: Yeah council meeting done

[9:38:42] Esbjornnn: Whole day Duncaning

[9:38:59] Maz0hyst: Duncaning What if we had a day, where we found the Cleetussy. Now let me cook, imagine if it was a portuguese dog dressed as a man
[9:38:59] EvilCoatrack: Duncaning but what if we just spent two months talking about this like we just did, but keep going over and over and over again?  Duncaning
[9:39:00] flugel_binder: we can fix everything KappaRoss LUL
[9:39:01] Acebravo_nz: Ducaning PopNemo

[9:39:08] squirtlehermit: you're right. captains have had meetings like that, but you and duncan aren't in that position yet
[9:39:10] leviathan297: Duncaning just let the city burn for a day
[9:39:10] Toastbane: Can talk all you want, but captains hold all hte power
[9:39:12] WHATtheINTERROBANG: Duncan can't say no or yes in 15 min LuL
[9:39:12] LogicWeasel: need to make PD more fun, it's no wonder people pick crim over it.
[9:39:13] taraannee: @kylemacs ahhh ok, thats kinda counter intuitive on their part tho since now pd salary comes from city budget..meaning they cant just hire a buncha ppl..
[9:39:14] clemson0607: it got shot down :’(
[9:39:15] splooshtasticals: Ease into it on ur own. Cpts don't seem to be brainstorming as much so we need to fill in wat they don't.
[9:39:16] Ragestrike: crash the council meeting
[9:39:17] w111iam1: Esfand should have a leadership role honestly
[9:39:19] imSteffin: @timedoggg, thats not even what they're talking about lol
[9:39:20] ZachFromChat: less people at the meeting is not the solution lol
[9:39:22] captain_araujo: i think we need another rank below captain no? 3 captains can't manage 7 days a week
[9:39:25] Orbilion: 4Head
[9:39:27] Toastedgamer03: @Van_1912 yeah but 2 captains have important irl things happening and the other is overworked as the result as that and needs a weekend break
[9:39:31] DieterK: @EsfandTV no caps ever on duty kekw
[9:39:31] Agony099: @w111iam1 not wrong mhm
[9:39:32] itsrambo: @Maz0hyst Clussy milks better
[9:39:33] Van_1912: how is cornwood not even a senior? thats whats nuts.
[9:39:35] LogicWeasel: Duncaning  what if I talked and then wrote things down.  that'd fix it right?
[9:39:35] Acebravo_nz: Ducan Duncaning OMEGALULAUGHING
[9:39:39] noah_a_104: talk to the mayor
[9:39:43] Chaoszero_goc: tell him to go patrol before the daptains get him again
[9:39:44] Mindhysteria: maybe need a sergeant to hire people and interview
[9:39:44] nimbleop: Primary on each car and split radios
[9:39:44] BLazOR_Prime: captains dont have a unified vision, they argue every captainsmeeting
[9:39:44] flugel_binder: I fixed the pd Jebaited
[9:39:45] cedemusic: Duncaning maybe instead of sending people to prison, i can just talk them to death
[9:39:45] SharkzGG_: @FarmirTv no they want a minimum of 20 hours a week when you get hired to PD, obviously IRL shit happens and its understood but the application says 20
[9:39:47] Supernopie: test
[9:39:47] taraannee: @SharkzGG_ ya ik he clearly hasnt learned & it was fair feedback slacks gave him, came from multiple pd & srs
[9:39:51] TodBoberts: Just walk away slowly, don't say shit just bail casually...
[9:39:54] alpine_ibex2: Duncaning
[9:39:56] Supernopie: no nascar and you still wrecked the car
[9:39:57] LogicWeasel: @cedemusic OMEGALUL True
[9:40:00] Wheez_3D: Duncan is delusional all talk no action
[9:40:00] CountDrax: Question, If you do not have the unit's Laundry chase, why not just get the hostage and do not chase. This could lead the crims to complacency and the get them off guard later?
[9:40:02] PsychoJoker: Duncaning
[9:40:02] Jerti_: Duncan
[9:40:05] Wallsh_: Duncan should be DOC.  and just talk to prisoners

[9:40:13] itsrambo: DAPS are coming
[9:40:15] Asleepenn: they need to start promoting people in pd
[9:40:20] BeerRun204: Duncan riding Cornwood stream audience to be more recognized
[9:40:21] splooshtasticals: Exactly LUL that's a problem right there. How do u grow from shiz like that. Closing doors doesn't work
[9:40:21] Gh0stZer0Phant0m: Wtf I just saw you on Streamer Awards?  How tf are you live?
[9:40:24] Xanisselis: When the captains are not the most active players, it becomes a shitshow
[9:40:25] krom01001: Duncaning
[9:40:27] IndeSyCiv: also if someone bring up federal govenment in a meeting and someones asks who is representing the federal government, they shouldn't be silenced
[9:40:27] Toastbane: @Wheez_3D Captains hold all the power, people can't change anything
[9:40:32] Asleepenn: captains are gone and they dont know what do to
[9:40:42] puppietreats: @beerrun204 it’s not that deep
[9:40:44] coppertec: I think maybe creating a PeeWee police force to train recruits in a low risk dept. that way they are trained and recuited in bulk. like a group of mall cops
[9:40:47] itsrambo: @Gh0stZer0Phant0m bruh he has been AI streaming since 2023

[9:53:13] Toluen090: Max was all for it. Nakado basically just re said what the captains said
[9:53:13] horsegirldotca: wtf is with the anti sheriff office thinking

[9:53:27] thegummibearmassacre: @DeoNone HUH
[9:53:28] GoofyMaskedGoober: But @EsfandTV isnt it a good incremental step towards the right direction. Atleast the state of the PD will improve no ?
[9:53:28] Icestruggler: this is gonna be funny because that ammunation thing will ahve multiple spawn up north with the next 7 containers

[9:53:50] shadow__rain: the plot twist would be  the PD liaison is corrupt @esfandtv
[9:53:51] BLazOR_Prime: @puppietreats Nekoda said he doesnt notice crime up there and Crane said is that because you only patrol the city and not up north to know

[9:53:58] Alexqc19: Mayor thing he has power OMEGALUL
[9:53:59] Bojabes: maybe miscommunication ebtween opening the LASO vs having it as a place to process happened @EsfandTV
[9:54:00] Kota216: hahaha so many people arguing about lore then one guy asking chat if taste buds come back from COVID. im crying.
[9:54:00] izahkiel: I was hoping for LASO too Cornwood, it's a bummer dude.
[9:54:01] SarahFlare: wait didn’t nekoda say he would be super gunning for you to become sheriff or was the rip?

[9:54:10] mandelblot: is it a ssaab decision ooc?
[9:54:10] AlexanderPethrus: They might be scared to let u leave city duty and bring in new recruits.. Maybe taking a bunch of the recruits under your wings in the north with 5-6 trusties would work
[9:54:10] RobialT: Cornwood gotta keep pushing
[9:54:11] Mastodonian: It's just the scapegoat excuse
[9:54:11] RebornOffline: They just don't understand

[9:54:25] rdogg79: Cornwood strike. Just civilian fir a few days

[9:54:28] bigcountry555: can't you just patrol up there anyways
[9:54:30] slomojosh: they keep running with opening another department would kill the PD line
[9:54:30] julho94: They want more cops
[9:54:30] Bromorin: Not enough cops though, you've said it yourself when you patrol alone
[9:54:31] aros603: he just said he wants it open and if it doesnt talk to him
[9:54:31] Raja_Banhammer: Wokege
[9:54:31] ShadowDragonv78: nicoae1DRACARYS nicoae1DRACARYS nicoae1DRACARYS
[9:54:31] nimbleop: Having the other place would make more police happen
[9:54:31] Xierany: At the start it would with transfers, but once you start recruiting on your own it increases the amount of cops
[9:54:32] DeoNone: Adam Sendler B)
[9:54:32] CAPONE66420: need LANG as mayor lol
[9:54:33] comrade_raptor: the people running the PD are going to tabl the server lmao its been obvious for a few weeks
[9:54:33] LogicWeasel: this PD leadership looks broken to the mayor
[9:54:34] Switchblade142: CHAT should i get wendys or taco bell
[9:54:35] dudemanbroo: put things in your own words and bring the proposal forward
[9:54:35] WhaleBlast: we need a true detective style police station not this big ass sherlock holmes style
[9:54:35] soggey_waffel: all good things come to those who wait
[9:54:35] Van_1912: said not enough crime up there.  BUT ...how does anyone know...if no cops are there?
[9:54:36] claptil: It's gonna take like 4 months at this rate
[9:54:37] Jaybye: its a bunch of miscommunication imo, the wrong people are going to these meetings
[9:54:38] YUPImMcLovin: Stare
[9:54:38] salvi9: When asked about crime, Nekoda said more crimes happen in the city than the north so that’s were the priorities should be
[9:54:38] AndHaka54: nothing can be done if they think its too soon
[9:54:38] dzztta: Is this WOW?
[9:54:38] bygodwest: I think they think that as soon as it's opened everyone is just going to leave LSPD
[9:54:39] LoudPackNoReefa: @esfandtv not something u can do in RP unfortunately, this stuff is just up to management
[9:54:41] ImStuckInATreeDud: o7 another 3 months
[9:54:42] jherrera154: Stare
[9:54:42] BLazOR_Prime: Crane and max agree theres a lot of crime up north they dont now if they have the power to start sheriff alone
[9:54:42] SeriousBeardCPC: time will prove you right
[9:54:42] toaster_strudes: Why not have two departments hiring at the same time that way there's double the leadership getting people trained up
[9:54:43] jinnytolls: Theres a big difference between making the building usable for LSPD vs opening BCSO. Everyone seems to just think that opening the sheriffs office = opening the bcso @EsfandTV
[9:54:43] blahder: Can't the facilities be opened before the department?
[9:54:44] aTsDiesel: I believe they think opening up another office wiill just divide the police officers
[9:54:44] Agentdolly: Maybe get the CoP position instead?
[9:54:46] ghostpuff__: i’m sure it’ll happen soon enough
[9:54:47] Maz0hyst: @Switchblade142 Wendys. TB's been kinda mid with their lack of menu
[9:54:47] IndeSyCiv: to many hotdogs LUL
[9:54:48] 98noir: arent there days where theres not enough people to handle all the chaos tho? feels like pushing for more cops or else open the sheriff could be a way to approach it
[9:54:48] thesonofbean: the problem is pd command
[9:54:51] greenburg22: @Chaoszero_goc esfand singleman hellw eek
[9:54:52] MrActivated: So no Little Texas??
[9:54:52] YUPImMcLovin: Cornwood just appears in front of people pepeLaugh
[9:54:52] Ragestrike: CHAT YOU WOULD GET MORE COPS IF YOU HAS LASO OPEN UP WHAT IS SO HARD to understand about that?
[9:54:54] Triist0ne: @bigcountry555 point is to have the office operable to be able to process from there to make patrolling north easier and more streamlined
[9:54:54] slomojosh: ITS LITERALLY THE FUCKING COPS THAT ARE WORKING AGAINST THIS LMAO
[9:54:55] BigglesVII: Next week is going to be interesting once the captains are around
[9:54:57] ncs_310: don’t worry LASO will open in 3 months when the sever becomes dead
[9:54:59] SteveAdeptus: Moon's been on the war path today
[9:55:01] Agentdolly: Get CoP and then open up the LASO then..
[9:55:01] flugel_binder: Esfand has heart man just wants to help people
[9:55:01] greencurtain: just arrest the captains and claim the PD as your own ;)
[9:55:03] AlexanderPethrus: Say u and 5 trusties go up north, and they bring in new cops in the city, it would suck for them in the city
[9:55:08] Sathure: Council seems fed up with the progress rate of the current PD command
[9:55:08] soggey_waffel: you are correct tho
[9:55:08] fixer_18: Crane said it is up to the devs. captains need to push for it harder
[9:55:09] Wallsh_: RUTH KEKW
[9:55:11] comrade_raptor: the people running the PD are tanking the server
[9:55:11] Ashcheeksx: They dont get that faster processing time will come a better life for the cops. so why wait to open it????
[9:55:11] Gachiguru: @BigglesVII if LMAO
[9:55:13] afghanpsycho: Nekoda keeps sabotaging it, you need to talk to him
[9:55:13] RobialT: PD shooting itself in the foot since DAY 1!!!
[9:55:15] Kota216: THE LAST thing the mayor said was that he told PD they better get a sherif office open because of crime.....
[9:55:16] Joongi_: "We need 332458454 officers to even start thinking about opening the Sheriff office" pepeW
[9:55:18] TimmayHS: chat, i love y'all, but some of you have some really cooked takes

[9:55:25] holyknightfran: @Ragestrike there is no point some don't understand that
[9:55:27] IndeSyCiv: all though after meeting with the mayor and the fake irish chick I[d wake up puking too
[9:55:27] BigglesVII: @Gachiguru HAHAH Cant argue that
[9:55:29] Kota216: how am i the only one to hear that
[9:55:30] SmellyGoatZ: pepeLaugh @TimmayHS very true
[9:55:30] splooshtasticals: North is gna be an eye opener 4 sure pepeLaugh just u wait
[9:55:31] HeyMeghan: I also think he basically just said captains are about to lose their jobs
[9:55:32] EPiQ: Its because 99% of the conversations have been about another department to help with numbers...not another office to process people for the time being. The entire "pitch" hasn't been organized.
[9:55:33] Maz0hyst: WideHardo LACK OF CAPTAINS WideHardo
[9:55:34] thegummibearmassacre: Captains NotLikeThis
[9:55:37] Atrix646: more people who can do shift 1

[9:55:39] Agentdolly: Yea nekoda seems to be the "rotten egg" it seems.
[9:55:40] 1manpizza: modCheck captains
[9:55:41] FauxReal__: PD feels like it's been stuck in the mud for a month-plus and ideas to help get things in motion just get put on the backburner. SAD!

[9:55:43] Wintyer2: Corwood cant be CoP it would look like an overstep
[9:55:43] ChaoticSanity: theres a cadet right there that could work the sheriffs office and you guys keep leaving them hanging in the wind...
[9:55:44] Craxxbones: Bruh, just play crim for a while
[9:55:44] Joongi_: 2 months kekw
[9:55:47] EliasRR_: @EsfandTV basically the decision is that the captains are the ones who have to push the devs for a BCSO, so talk to slacks
[9:55:47] Atrix646: AINTNOWAY
[9:55:48] TimmayHS: Nekoda isn't really an ally, isn't that Ruth's lapdog?
[9:55:48] PsychoJoker: Thats exactly what Max was saying
[9:55:48] Kota216: THE LAST thing the mayor said was that he told PD they better get a sherif office open because of crime.....
[9:55:49] TinyTimmy365: @HeyMeghan yup
[9:55:50] WhaleBlast: tell them what needs to happen cyr
[9:55:50] robertsmithjr: nekoda never said he didnt want him sheriff, its more that quite often there are less then 10 cops on, any given shift

[10:10:13] BoldSlowbro: The immediate establishment of LASO arises from a pressing need for a law enforcement presence in regions where criminal activity has seen a rise  due to the absence of effective policing. Areas such as Paleto Bay and Grape Seed have suffered from a lack of law enforcement resources, resulting in increased criminal incidents and a sense of insecurity among residents. LASO's formation addresses this urgent need by deploying highly trained officers to these neglected areas.

The story trends on Twitter. Esfand turns down talk show appearances. His septic tank fails. People form a cult. His toilet is finished.

[10:44:18] bbbrabbit123: you should be the chief of police for awhile until turner is active enough to perform the role
[10:44:18] Gr1zzz: Yes, definitely a betrayal since he literally let him to believe he would take it to them and support it. And as a double doofus move borrowed 15k earlier today

[11:05:35] Marl33: I’ll be the bbq guy of the office
[11:05:35] psybeast818: @DappsTV the perfect shift
[11:05:36] Gachiguru: way more than 10 needed
[11:05:36] coppertec: how about rotating shifts? everyone has to/gets to do a weekly tour of the satellite
[11:05:36] existinne: 8-10
[11:05:38] lookachef: @clutchstache lots of cringe, and the nominations were obviously bot driven.
[11:05:40] ToyLetTreat: 2 cars and 1 heli so its literally a skeleton crew
[11:05:42] smpies: 3-4 patrol car per shift is good tbh

[11:06:03] ChaoticSanity: @EsfandTV in all honesty, the way you get this done is by getting your ass up north and making some arrests
[11:06:03] bertacharm: how many expendables are we looking at Duncaning
[11:06:04] Gachiguru: @smpies its 4 cars per 80 so only one scene at a time
[11:06:07] izahkiel: @PWRslide2 10-40
[11:06:08] ROC_Cronica: @T0pher_C lol you must be fun at parties.

[11:06:09] PsyOctopi: esfandTV
[11:06:10] PGMuNrOe: realistically you can start it with 2, basically 2 guys online during whatever time to police the north
[11:06:11] SurelyBaked: tbh cornwood could bring all new bodies in he just needs an experienced advisor and command
[11:06:13] Zarniwooper: Why is he so obsessed with the numbers, just have enough for at least the active hours

[11:06:50] BradySafety: peepoTalk
[11:06:56] badichy: even if your short on shift they can always wander up north to help you out. Atleast 2 per shift. and if you guys are doing a ton of arrests/cites you request more
[11:06:56] Mastodonian: You don't need perfect shift coverage tbh, it's better than having it be 0 like it is now
[11:06:57] ROC_Cronica: @T0pher_C You can always hit the  x at the top right if you dont like it.

[11:48:01] greyjulian: @psychojoker i get irl stuff happens, but when you only have 3 captains and 2 of them can’t be around, the PD needs leadership of some kind
[11:48:02] HeyMeghan: @greyjulian he literally got dapped for not working and he still doesn’t work. he spent his entire time on shift today yapping
[11:48:08] NasrulAshr: flop and duncan should be high command if it happen
[11:48:11] Cthyllah: it doesnt even have anything to do with numbers, the whole point is to hire more people and build it out, the same way they did with pd. they arent trying to split up the current officers

What is 'twitch' getting? if you view twitch as the viewers of twitch. Also, as for "twitch" you're basically creating a pseudo-union. Not sure how OTK is doing anything other than view sharing for profit and self-profit of sponsors.

[13:09:39] Kfoo_: @happensinthegame yes.   objectively good quality.  maybe a little expensive compared to what you can build on your own but it's a prebuilt so you have to expect a little premium there.

[13:10:11] minich4rmander: @meathead_48 its not a valid point. a scene can move buddy. so tellim them they cant say "i arrived at scene" and then "where is the scene" after, is bs
[13:10:11] taraannee: @fiveftoffun i’m such a fiend for that type of shit i feel like esfand wouldn’t care the format but i’m like ok u want like roman numerals, MLA, bullet points LUL i’ll probs post multiple options

[13:12:03] ZuldeadTV: FirstTimeChatter yes, cornwood is the priority, RP'ing esfand is second
[13:12:07] GoofyMaskedGoober: @drmenac He's been fucking yer mum as a side hustle too. c:
[13:12:15] Kevz95: @minich4rmander scene moving should have been called out on the radio. in which case dispatch won't be confused. she's just trying to do her job properly. it's not a big deal to anyone but you.

[13:12:32] traemblz: RP is love, RP is life
[13:12:32] minich4rmander: @meathead_48 no. i have a point. u cant tell people not to use those 2 codes in a row, if those 2 codes dont contridict each other. thats just wrong
[13:12:33] splooshtasticals: complacency will ultimately screw them in the end. They see u coming but they're only trying to stop progress
[13:12:35] jesscdcc: @drmenac thats crazy man, hes a grown ass man, he knows his own body and limitations, even if you think its crazy for you to do that doesnt mean the same for esfand

[13:47:21] CodeForTea: when can you get a new liaison?

[13:47:27] blahder: Called it
[13:47:30] splooshtasticals: Pretty sure the corrupt PD peeps know the jig is up & they're only trying to gaslight/divide. Talking to nekoda will set the precedence.

[13:47:49] Kfoo_: @Recon_XoX there's debate as to whether or not the LASO would fall under the LSPD and thus under the captains

[13:48:04] bluej255: point to cornwood lol
[13:48:04] Kingzro: @killerpvm his pretty much right, but Nakoda said he still needs captain approval. And even Crane said the council doesnt really have the power to control PD
