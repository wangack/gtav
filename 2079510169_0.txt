[4:06:55] BowlOfRice831: American Towing League?
[4:06:57] boolove: i dont think theyre worried about jordan - they probably want to track randos that are working out of the lot when hes not around
[4:06:59] goshdanghecker: Susge
[4:07:02] ThatLittleRedBird: @boolove if there's no garage, there's nothing to operate, they just RP it out, but maybe that's overlooking something
[4:07:04] CrackThatBrokeYoMommaBack: why he still got that
[4:07:07] mrscoops420: I <# thw marabuntas

[4:07:36] CaptnCrafty: Probably dont want other players to get confused on where there car got taken too
[4:07:36] slurmy: could do it so you can log it without despawning it
[4:07:37] alottashartz: they should just investigate
[4:07:39] Fenix_Hero: They could technically log them themselves though?
[4:07:40] granddemon: I think they think there HAS to be a mechanic involved and that people can't RP it. Like how they fucked Tusk's entire chracter with the meters when his RP with fine over the mechanics
[4:07:40] Bluehanded: The cars will still physically be there
[4:07:42] klaatuNaatu: @boolove Maybe but they also had a stipulation of like 5 employees max
[4:07:43] Bradgor: Its a private business they wouldnt have free access to the logs anyway
[4:07:43] cedrickdbz: ZAZA
[4:07:45] Hindar23: just delete the log discord dog
[4:07:45] Atraboule: Lot Q had nothing like that and it worked

[4:07:48] FGradePlay: it's fucking towing on an RP server it doesnt have to be that serious LULW
[4:07:48] ThatLittleRedBird: 100% they want it for paperwork
[4:07:49] EmpressJade: we'll see what Mantis says
[4:07:51] early_retirement: look at how ppl freak out about Jordan tho LUL
[4:07:51] dalthun: eat something fatty
[4:07:52] wastewater_: I agree 100% but it seems like something they want to push for so they can have legal documentation
[4:07:52] OtterFightingClub: @CaptnCrafty you can track it
[4:07:53] BWV861: i care Smadge
[4:07:53] fuuhhzz: BenchPEPW

[4:07:58] TheeYeti: if they want logs then they can write up a warrant
[4:07:59] Bnooru: another meter incident Sadge
[4:07:59] roguegunslinger1: they will just finally take it on a random tow where you accidentally run someone over
[4:08:01] furiousfurioso: yea it's gotten over-regulated to the point where they feel they need all that
[4:08:02] jack51o_o: is that a reeses easter egg you just unwrapped
[4:08:02] granddemon: @NikkiFromNirn Oh no...
[4:08:03] boolove: CANDIII the paperwork
[4:08:03] captainshtbox: we think this car was illegally tow'd can we see the picture? is that easy
[4:08:04] BigMAK3K: is that a Hall's?
[4:08:05] wiz1: I agree
[4:08:10] GreatGrandma: I get having the pictures for the grinders who RP towing, but the people that work for the business will have a lot more oversight already
[4:08:15] dP_Lo: do you just have to RP all the symptoms of a dirty fuckin pill fiend bitch?
[4:08:16] goshdanghecker: if they want logs they can look in my toilet a haha
[4:08:17] gambit_: there she is
[4:08:20] tosfriendlyname: Why not take the lot and do it your way untill someone tells you to stop and then challenge them on it
[4:08:21] effeffess1: where is tommy :(
[4:08:23] Toum_X2: So what if an employee get caught doing illegal shit with the impound lot ?
[4:08:25] BobRossSaladToss: HotBois
[4:08:29] Reptar1025: Sadge
[4:08:32] CrazyLikeSwayze: Sadge
[4:08:34] Pexterra: impound logs for state is fine because its on a per person basis, for private the business is done for if you get caught
[4:08:37] fartsmellsg00d: Dont worry mantis will fix this
[4:08:38] Reptar1025: mantis that fucker
[4:08:38] The_Nixon_of_NASCAR: if they want paper work just make a filing cabnet @PENTA thats all they have to do lol
[4:08:39] ThatLittleRedBird: how about a log mechanic for the tow, but it just doesn't valet it ??
[4:08:44] Hindar23: Just make it so you have to take a picture to tow. Then use that in court if needed. What's the issue?
[4:08:52] glazedscronut: @Toum_X2 by who? the cops could just charge them
[4:08:57] DirtyDanFromDiscord: why cant they just have the procedure be showing the impounded cars owner the picture?
[4:09:01] effeffess1: does mantis even know who you are and what you're about
[4:09:03] VakiTV: I think it's how would you know which lot towed your car
[4:09:04] CaptainKoma: Yeah
[4:09:08] badonkaboots5: yep
[4:09:08] fuuhhzz: yep
[4:09:09] alottashartz: it’s already pretty strict if u want to own a business, too much red tape is gonna discourage people from creating shit

[4:34:32] RektangleTV: 2 was def harder
[4:34:32] Wolfstriker121: ds2 is the hardest
[4:34:32] lemonboy1351: DESKCHAN Mantis
[4:34:34] dP_Lo: dark souls 1 is way less linear than Elden ring imo
[4:34:34] DarkOne253: Easiest one except maybe demons souls

[4:34:40] granddemon: @boolove You okay? Who hurt you
[4:34:40] Reggaejunkiedrew: A lot of what makes Dark Souls 1 is fuck you design, shit that will kill you if you dont know its there or how it works. I think Elden rings a little harder, but it has less of that type of stuff

[5:38:42] Ol_Geiser: thats the type of shit that the Repo Man has to do, i think its immersive @PENTA
[5:38:43] mrsploogerson: spam punching is running and punching at the same time abusing a fighting mechanic
[5:38:47] sterowentUS: @renleve monkaS imagine the spaghetti code
[5:38:48] Twatypus: repo towing guys get shit on the hook and out the driveway faster than it takes to prep the hooks on onx
[5:38:48] ZyberFox: Otherwise it would mess up the car LUL

[5:38:51] volazal: if they wanted towing to take longer it can be changed spam punching is not intended
[5:38:51] sin_ikle: are the new tow trucks still getting worked on?
[5:38:54] doogar: even if it meant the time of it getting on the back is longer
[5:38:57] boolove: the hooks would be so good but i dont think its possible - it just adds an extra layer of deysnc
[5:38:59] tosfriendlyname: i remember on the other server once marked for impound people couldnt get into their car for a while
[5:39:01] assassinm3: you should be able to buy and upgraded tow truck that can do that
[5:39:02] AerialAce94: needs to deal damage to the car if they drive away or something after "hooks" are on
[5:39:05] sneakyysaddam: bro irl the tow trucks will have your shit gone in like 20 seconds no lol
[5:39:06] oddlighting: watching the progression of a server is Kewl!
[5:39:12] Cory1750: its already hard enough to tow without worrying about "realistic truck positioning"
[5:39:13] th3killin: @PENTA towing is just soo bugged, fixing that will solve soo many issues
[5:39:16] Meatyfrog: @KidsSeeeGhosts it apparently started seeing issues from the server meshing stuff, and dev priorities have been different
[5:39:17] ZyberFox: @AerialAce94 I was thinking the same NODDERS
