[1:15:08] Fossabot: Don't tell Dean information about other characters that he does not know in game. He cannot do things if it is said in chat and he sees it. Sit back and just enjoy the rp.
[1:15:17] quinnntino: what's the cops name who's talking rn
[1:15:26] c0rrexx: @bobdang07hd fr, shes doing papework in the station all the time, but apparently now shes "in hiding" deansoP

[1:16:18] bobdang07hd: @c0rrexx agreed, shes 1 of 3 captains dealing with a shit show of a PD sometimes. Her being rent free in all these peoples heads means her character is doing great
[1:16:27] Wiidiis: You should kinda be required to stream if your gonna be captain of the PD
[1:16:31] m4l1kkk: Den is so nervous ü•∫

[1:17:01] ahemh: So the victims are in cuffs and the attackers are free ones again KEKW
[1:17:04] buddhaPJS: that isnt self defense
[1:17:05] scafuri0us: 3 x in passed 30 min 1of 8
[1:17:05] AsuniRS: no one should be required to stream because a large portion of rp viewers cant behave
[1:17:08] FatGirlDrunk: If its in the witness of a felony?
[1:17:09] hemmorj: no offence but why is dean being a good boy infront of these officers ? BRUHMM
[1:17:11] Gachiguru: no time served for violent felonies
[1:17:14] EGGZOLENTZ: @wiidiis i think she does more high command stuff honestly. I seen her on SSabbs stream. They were talking about fixing stuff
[1:17:18] Qwrtymuad: @wiidiis disagree, captains or anyone in high positions are trusted
[1:17:23] officialChicoB: She streams, i have watched her stream before

[1:17:50] Wiidiis: @bobdang07hd no Ruth‚Äôs character is not doing great, she‚Äôs a horrible officer on the streets and should not be leading a department IMO
[1:17:51] Qu_ad: @TemporaryEvil barely anything qualifies for self defense
[1:17:55] Fossabot: If your enjoying the stream smash the DAMN follow button! I mean shit its just a click away... Might see your name on screen ;)
[1:17:56] EGGZOLENTZ: @ahemh if ppl would tell the truth they'd not have this issue
[1:18:06] rollesaurus: the manager shoud get charge
[1:18:10] xypher85: chat its morning i beg allow it peepoBrick
[1:18:25] MDM4ever1986HD: @bobdang07hd I agree Ruth is doing her job and showing that even though she's a villain in-game doesn't mean she doesn't deserve shit on stream when she does
[1:18:40] Cheexur: snipers this early?damn
[1:18:45] RonJon: @TemporaryEvil self defence requires you to take the least violent method possible to neutralize the threat
[1:18:49] skengblazer: Covid talk in 2024 btw
[1:18:50] MDM4ever1986HD: RP isn't that deep chat
[1:18:51] bobdang07hd: @Wiidiis lol charcaters doing great if everyone cant stop talking about her. What about slacks giving daps? No one cries about that. Get a grip
[1:18:53] DanLGG: Self defense is actually really hard and really easy to prove. you just can not be the aggressor. if there‚Äôs a chance to leave you gotta take it

[3:29:34] Athasin: @Janman88 She tased him against SOPs, you're suppose to tase unless they tackle, do too many car swaps, or pit a cop,
[3:29:35] eqnjn: You could give the passenger accessory to a felony so they're both technically fleeing felons to justify the shooting
