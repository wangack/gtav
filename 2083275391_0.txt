[0:26:39] Chiracho: my immersion! Kappa
[0:26:43] jimothy64: I mean all that means is she did it later when there were less prying eyes

[0:27:07] JoeayIV: its better this way anyways
[0:27:22] NoobEmployee: Or maybe the memory was altered nakkiMary
[0:27:31] JoeayIV: cuz it changed the whole "its just tylenol 3" she was taking from the bottle
[0:27:49] jimothy64: She took the oxy, got dosed up and forgot taking it until she was super drunk later :)
[0:27:51] JoeayIV: do you want the clip?

[3:20:05] StreamElements: Mary Wolf is Tessa's violent alter ego. Tessa Blacks out when Mary takes control and has no memory of what Mary does. Mary tends to be triggered by the senseless murder of aminals. Recently Mary has come to realize that nearly everyone is guilty in some way and wants to use the PD as a means to enact the justice that she has been craving. Typically, any time Tessa pulls the trigger, it won't be Tessa.
