[3:57:53] No_bull_shet: so he gets parsons then?
[3:57:58] taraannee: in rp it’s not the same but he is fit to stand trial bc he understands consequences to actions, he’s just not fit to testify. he also wouldn’t fit for a 5150 LUL LUL
[3:58:04] ItsMavray: 5150 for life
[3:58:10] dapyman: Only ask question that are open ended
[3:58:11] crazyfr0gtv: NOT FIT FOR TRIAL EZ IRL
[3:58:11] Trepko: He told Cornwood no once LUL
[3:58:14] killaton: bro he would end up in federal prison like the green mile
[3:58:15] No_bull_shet: hes a massive liability to all free citizens

[3:58:18] FinexLive: I would try to determine if he could be dangerous to others
[3:58:26] Xethra: I mean he's asked you to ask him open ended questions saabShrug
[3:58:26] Ned15: I mean saying yes is one thing, his actions another
[3:58:37] WildWillie419: He just says yes
[3:58:39] wolfears4: not mentally competent to stand trial, remanded to parson's until such time that he is
[3:58:43] Rare__Potato: classic
[3:58:43] walkgleesh: the moment he gets a mistrial sonya will make him do crimes again
[3:58:44] DanLGG: oh no
[3:58:44] Ned15: She asked open ended what,who,when and he answered
[3:58:47] ShadowFennixx: convenient
[3:58:51] layla109: Did ramee forget how trials work. He wouldn't be testifying.
[3:58:56] DanLGG: Well that’s on them
[3:58:56] Wort3xx: barkyWait
[3:59:03] BigglesVII: Eval report will have to show he knows right from wrong, if he does then he is fit to stand. Just have to be careful with questions.
[3:59:05] dapyman: Yes/No questions should only be not used as testimonials evidence
[3:59:05] ShadowFennixx: its funny it was 3 weeks ago
[3:59:08] taraannee: what qualifies as “not fit for trial” in no pixel isn’t the same irl so i got no idea NotLikeThis
[3:59:08] will_ball: honestly idk how you handle this guy
[3:59:09] LowKeeLoki: he understands the consequences, he is mentally fit.  he just can not physically say the word no.
[3:59:12] seamus_souleater: @Ned15 Not true, if he doesn't have free will then when someone tells him to do crime he isn't held accountable.
[3:59:14] walkgleesh: OMEGALUL

[4:00:22] FinexLive: DonoWall
[4:00:25] robertsmithjr: unfit to stand trial doesnt mean he is absolved of the charges , so its interesting ramee is pushing for it

[4:01:13] talamah: LULE
[4:01:14] Eddie1225: yea i think thats what kanter is trying to figure out
[4:01:18] taraannee: his rp “condition” is only that he can’t say the WORD “no” not that he has no free will LUL
[4:01:21] FinexLive: OMEGALAUGHING
[4:01:23] Kevz95: OMEGALAUGHING
[4:01:24] lynnchesque: you have to test him, give him a gun and say, 'shoot me' ... either he has a choice or not
[4:01:29] Eddie1225: he can say yes but does he have the free will to actually do it
[4:01:32] seamus_souleater: @seamus_souleater that's not the point, if he has a mental condition that makes him follow instructions given to him then he doesn't have free will. There is actual case law for this.
[4:01:46] BigglesVII: its actus rae and mens rae in rl
[4:01:57] taraannee: @seamus_souleater but that’s not the condition he has, he just can’t physically say the word “no”
[4:02:12] taraannee: also it’s not even a real condition so no there’s not case law for it LUL

[4:03:27] puhctek: @taraannee, it definitely seems like he is compelled to do whatever is asked. it's not just that he cant say no, he actually does what he is told to do when he says yes
[4:03:32] Kevz95: i don't even understand the argument in chat right now. he can say 'yes' but not actually do the thing KEKW
[4:03:36] mochalex: LUL I know
[4:03:37] ExoticMeats: He ain't lying
[4:03:44] di_zzzyy: @puhctek Yea he always follows whatever he's told to do
[4:03:49] puhctek: yes that's the issue
[4:03:53] Kevz95: everyone's waiting for you
[4:03:57] taraannee: @puhctek noo.. he’s stated many times he just can’t say the word no
[4:04:01] BohLTss: !dap @Eddie1225
[4:04:01] StreamElements: BohLTss just Dapped @Eddie1225. This user has been dapped 4 times.
[4:04:03] seamus_souleater: there is related case law, like forcing someone who has Down syndrome to commit a crime. If they are coerced into an action they aren't held liable in court.
[4:04:03] mochalex: Beric and Pixie
[4:04:05] knowlightnofear: Ramee is getting the doctor as a character witness

[4:04:13] talamah: LULE

[4:05:53] dakota22446: saabOwo
[4:06:06] seamus_souleater: It's not though... I'm arguing the merits of a defense that states if he can't say no and has to follow actions given to him he no longer has free will and can not be held accountable for his actions. Instead, those charges would actually go onto the person who coerced them to do the crime.
[4:06:10] msdeell: you got this
[4:06:18] BigglesVII: The psyc eval should determine if he knows right from wrong and the extent of the condtion on his actions. Does he always carry out actions when saying yet. Just in this scene he has said he wants to blow up the court house but he didnt do it etc...

[4:06:57] crazyfr0gtv: !meta
[4:06:57] StreamElements: Please do not meta in chat, which means do not tell Saab stuff happening in RP that his character would otherwise not know.
[4:06:57] Kevz95: @seamus_souleater you're assuming he's coerced, but his condition is just that he has to say yes. he still has the ability to NOT do the crime. idk where you got this assumption.

[4:09:24] cobracraig: can u? lol
[4:09:27] seamus_souleater: Actually, that's a huge example of him not being able to control his actions. He gave 2k to Chris King like a month ago.

[4:09:38] celestedgaf7: this argument was gonna happen eventually for this guy
[4:09:40] di_zzzyy: @taraannee He understands the consequences but from what I've seen he does whatever he's told no matter what
[4:09:43] seamus_souleater: @seamus_souleater No he has been asked IF HE WANTS to do crime, not to do it.
[4:09:54] seamus_souleater: that is a big difference

[4:12:37] seamus_souleater: @taraannee He asked if he WOULD, he did not ask him to DO THE CRIME. Please get it through your head, the syntax of the question is important in this case.
[4:12:37] walkgleesh: he will just kidnap someone again
[4:12:38] killaton: they just repeated what slacks said

[4:15:36] DevilDogTash: you aren’t asking the right question… just because he only says yes does that make him do the action?
[4:15:45] top_flamingo: regardless, watching you and ramee in court is always enjoyable

See, normally if you go one on one with another wrestler, you got a 50/50 chance of winning. But I’m a genetic freak and I’m not normal! So you got a 25%, AT BEST, at beat me. Then you add Kurt Angle to the mix, your chances of winning drastic go down. See the 3 way at Sacrifice, you got a 33 1/3 chance of winning
