[5:28:01] csplisskin: NOPERS not lazy, NODDERS too much of a hardship nikkisSmile
[5:28:03] Bruvverbean: yea, just do the jewelery job NODDERS
[5:28:10] GrumpyMark01: I think Michael just wants people to do crime
[5:28:27] bluesfan77: G6 should really give a stipend for repairs.
[5:28:34] Bruvverbean: already piled shit on G6, time to pile more KEKW
[5:28:38] colacubes1: what about ambulance or does the government pay for that
[5:28:40] minnmor: @GrumpyMark01 i think its more that people would be realistic rp
[5:28:52] nyx_constellation: I think he often thinks very idealistic
[5:28:54] EternitysRaven: I understand why he wants to make this law, I get it's immersion and all but it's just a bit over the top
[5:29:22] ThoughtfulWalrus: So whose going to police the PD vehicles to keep them in good condition
[5:29:51] stridro: g6 pay for our repairs
[5:29:59] clumsyjoe_: never forget the - not in my eyes argument

[5:31:29] colacubes1: if they don’t get robbed lol
[5:31:36] EternitysRaven: Yeah your passenger can literally knock your door off just by stepping out of the car
[5:31:38] bluesfan77: If they're going to have this, then provide repair kits at city hall or something?
[5:31:54] NuTr1x: nobodys doing an 8 hour g6 shift
[5:31:58] minnmor: you pay fuel and repairs too...
[5:32:02] stridro: true its all if you dont get rob
[5:32:13] bluesfan77: City buys kits from local businesses so they don't lose money.
[5:32:23] csplisskin: NODDERS
[5:32:30] clumsyjoe_: so you need a buffer of cash, before you start a job, with a perfect vehicle
[5:32:55] Jillibean20: My question with this is I thought that repair kits degraded the parts a little. So if you're using a repair kit to just repair body does it still degrade the parts thus costing more when you go get a full repair?
[5:33:10] jamm0302: in a realistic world its reasonable this city is not reasonable
[5:33:15] minnmor: ^
[5:33:15] Nightbot: ^^ What they said nikkisSmile
[5:33:34] bluesfan77: So then cops start setting people up by ramming parked cars and then pull them over for being damaged.

[5:33:57] ThoughtfulWalrus: Time for vehicle insurance then. Start claims LUL

[5:36:25] GrumpyMark01: Perhaps just let this happen and see if people keep doing G6?
[5:36:33] jamm0302: i feel he views it from a view that does not take into account the way the city is
[5:36:35] minnmor: surely...
[5:37:09] Symbiontey: NODDERS
[5:37:33] stridro: NODDERS how much is it close to real world
[5:37:52] bluesfan77: Not sure if with the cop RP if they track number of citations, etc. but could see where they could really manipulate this to entrap a ton of people.

[5:42:09] ISkeenssI: I think telling people with 60% parts to go get their shit fixed is fine. If they dont do it and get caught again fineing them is also fine imo

[5:43:11] Chritters: I don't think this is a bad idea. I just the timing is unfortunate.
[5:43:14] naturewise17: after 2 months in the city full grinding this might bring city morale to 0
[5:43:17] Chritters: It's gonna kill people's desire to do anything.
[5:43:22] jamm0302: as said it just seems like something that does not fit the way the city is
