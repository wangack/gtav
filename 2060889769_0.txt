[1:34:32] Jack_Rang3r: its also more tempting to rob g6 because more likely they are a civilian not in a gang.
[1:34:33] r_troglodyte: Just makes the civ grinders need to diversify their grind. Run out daily g6 then go do other grind

[2:30:35] KOZCO: now I just want Kevin in BBMC because he is looking for a boat already AAAA
[2:30:51] DOWNBAD_ELLY: Dee was on full health so its kinda eh. Jason was prob low
[2:30:59] teenywren: it's pushing it but like you're literally facing years in jail people would do some crazy shit in that situation
[2:31:00] pepe_silvia_as: people high dive all the time
[2:31:01] Lunar_Delta: @knowlightnofear Dundee survived but Jason died. Id leave it to mechanics
[2:31:08] subehh: kinda one of those gameplay over realism moments imho
[2:31:10] el_gato_64: Jason said he was low
[2:31:15] Dumpy5: Did you bellyflop or dive correctly.
[2:31:18] sao_mito: People also dive 100ft in real life
[2:31:19] Nomad_Ninja: Jason's prob was he wasn't 100% health when he jumped
[2:31:21] Outraise_: nvl?
[2:31:23] Max_Mckayful: Whippy breaking it dow
[2:31:27] rivaldo_33: I feel like its fair
[2:31:27] yolfiic: what if they make it a random mechanic where you have a chance of dying
[2:31:28] datsyukiandekes: high dive competitions are a thing
[2:31:32] el_gato_64: Roleplay > ruleplay
[2:31:35] Sigfred42: But you could die eatting a Sandwich on a Wednesday.
[2:31:35] ruthlessthered: I feel if cops are shooting at you... Jumping sounds like a good idea
[2:31:39] Lord_Machiavellian: Cops were shooting at him right, better to take the chance with the water over the bullets
[2:31:39] iamloyaltytv: Jason could of been shot on they way down and wasnt 100%
[2:31:39] Gouldiekun: i mean. dundees jumped off the bridge many times. one would think hes became a professional at that spot specifically :D
[2:31:43] someonecreepin: pretty sure real peopple have done that and survived
[2:31:48] dragonesk22: bro was about to get shot
[2:31:51] JohnnyBThunders: Dundee seems like the type of dude to jump off a bridge
[2:31:52] Thanlen: Someone could believe they wouldn’t of died doing that
[2:31:55] ZMHunter: is dundee back to the game or far behind still?
[2:32:01] subehh: dundee also isnt an entirely sane character LOL
[2:32:02] knowlightnofear: I agree its grey area for sure. Good shit either way. made for a good clip
[2:32:05] rivaldo_33: Maybe he had a panic attack mid air? Natural cause of death...
[2:32:05] dragonesk22: custard gave the orders to shoot him
[2:32:07] xviperr: the cops DID threaten to shoot you
[2:32:09] snowbydu: my interpretation of why it is not "nvl" is that if you are slightly damage you becom incapacitated. but that is a liked bank escapeplan route
[2:32:09] ikeidine: i mean trying to pit a semi is deadly in a cpvi
[2:32:12] OpyPhupapy: Fleeing anyone can try to jump down from a high roof or bridgr IRL.
[2:32:15] Mic_Stargazer: NVL is vague as hell. Not stopping when the cops shooting is technically NVL right? But obviously no one ever doea
[2:32:19] skutza: it's water, if it was buildings/concrete it would be a different story - you are fine don't overthink this. whipLove
[2:32:21] DOWNBAD_ELLY: I see it as Dee was full health so it made sense at tat point. Jason had just been shot so it was an o7 for him Saddies
[2:32:22] SlashThePriest: If the cops were shooting or threatening to shoot I would def consider it warrented
[2:32:26] Nomad_Ninja: if jumping off a bridge is NVL, the driving off the pier is definitely NVL
[2:32:27] BloomOnline: I think the idea that "you could survive" means It's situational and you should consider as the very last ditch effort.
[2:32:28] Max_Mckayful: I can't get over Jason still just in a coma out there in the water, lol
[2:32:32] teenywren: I think doing risky stuff is fair when you're running away from years in the clink
[2:32:35] MixoligistMajor: if thereis  a chance of survival then u r valuing ur life.
[2:32:38] ivanreq: the cops did threaten to shoot as a negotiation shxtouKek
[2:32:39] fadebruhhh: Can u make it blue?
[2:33:04] alienslx: It all goes back too being a game. So NVL is objective
[2:33:09] nummento: air -1 PTSD kicking in AAAA
[2:33:09] Xellwrath: @skutza impacting the water at high speeds makes water behave no different than concrete. It's pretty much a done deal if you hit water at terminal velocity
[2:33:10] romfi: Sneak
[2:33:21] pepe_silvia_as: has air 1 even come out in 4.0?
[2:33:21] Thanlen: Do they have Air 1?
[2:33:28] snowbydu: metal gear dundee
[2:33:32] Mic_Stargazer: In the same vein running from a guy with a knife IS valuing your life, it's a weird standard tbh
[2:33:32] MixoligistMajor: now it’s cannon u can survive the fall so they should allow it.
[2:33:56] pepe_silvia_as: your best escapes though were running away from air1
[2:33:59] alienslx: Air 1 will probably return with banks
[2:34:01] pepe_silvia_as: they are legendary
[2:34:08] SlashThePriest: Yeah, if they need to buff the PD they're better ways of doing it than air1
[2:34:15] Fossabot:  whipStinky Please do not tell streamer what to do or how to do it unless specifically asked by streamer, even if he forgets or doesn't see something. Back-seating acts as an unwanted external influence to the roleplay.
[2:34:22] h1tman87: do we have croc up and running yet or you not bothering with cop this time round?
[2:34:23] IronicViking: air one is  cool for races or events etc, but not for every event
[2:34:31] Ughers: Cops probably didn't dive in because of how fragile people are nowadays
[2:34:36] DieMrCupCake: Air 1 should only be for the worst of the worst crimes
[2:34:36] Mic_Stargazer: PD can spawn boats at docks, if they wanted to look they'd be looking lol
[2:34:39] silvershad0: air1 needs more drawbacks this time around
[2:34:40] yolfiic: i feel like air 1 should be used for major crimes
[2:34:42] Sigfred42: My biggest issue with Air 1 was when it left to refuel your window of getting away was not long enough
[2:34:45] fadebruhhh: This reminds me of a mission from Gta Sandreas
[2:34:46] Thanlen: they need to nerf it if they do bring it back
[2:34:47] snowbydu: air 1 vs bikes, toughts?
[2:35:12] ivanreq: WHOOP WHOOP shxtouCheer that’s the sound of Dundee
[2:35:13] pepe_silvia_as: you still escaped from it though, maybe just reducing when they use it
[2:35:17] al_ex: momentum
[2:35:17] romfi: AAAA
[2:35:18] nummento: Dolphin Dundee
[2:35:20] Nomad_Ninja: Air-1 should only be used for high-profile crimes, like the vault, maybe some banks, but they used it for EVERYTHING when they had the chance

[5:32:03] DOWNBAD_ELLY: Arent the gems 20,500?
[5:32:04] superallig8r: If u sell the jewels cant u just spend the time getting more cash?
[5:32:04] pepe_silvia_as: thats a big loss tbh
[5:32:04] m0rtified: if you can wait for crypto to mine you can wait for cash to wash
[5:32:05] Lordicon: Wait for right person to sell to or find other ways of getting rid of it
[5:32:05] coolboarder5: Week, it will change
[5:32:10] ShaqMaker: I think main concern is the money so sell now save later
[5:32:10] BloomOnline: i do not vote
[5:32:10] yolfiic: idk u do u thooo
[5:32:12] Kinson1: Do it ALL yourself and you get the full 21k
[5:32:13] darksidezzzzz: sell and have more time for more licks
[5:32:14] kacperthe3: your makinging more money per hour selling now
[5:32:14] BurningCrows: can you make $4k doing other shit?
[5:32:15] Valroz: so in a week you will have a month to wait
[5:32:15] MDCproject: Ask Kelly? He is a bit of a degen.
[5:32:15] Krisgadgets: when the casino open
[5:32:16] geckoZen: don't sell it, prove us wrong PepeLaugh
[5:32:16] sao_mito: I would do everything to get the 21k
[5:32:18] pepe_silvia_as: find a better buyer maybe?
[5:32:22] Kronzo: I'd sell it now, cause realistically 3 days is a long fuckin' time when you can gather x2 that amount of jewels in that time
[5:32:23] ReaperUK: @Whippy Do 3 runs and keep em going, and sell excess 10 runs
[5:32:27] skutza: do it yourself whipSlam
[5:32:27] 58winterking85: meet in the middle 5.5!
[5:32:28] lodropna: oh no 3 days of something sitting there that u dont lose
[5:32:29] thebradshaw6: how much more could you get in three days?
[5:32:30] AsmoStyle: Definitely offer 5.5
[5:32:31] jschrage10: meet in middle and try and maximize profit and sell as jewels
[5:32:34] C4leb0rn: how often can you make that many gems
[5:32:34] DontTellMyFriends: how much MORE could you make in three days?
[5:32:37] kyse2: sell now cuz if u not cleaning all the time what is the point
[5:32:38] vinchenzo_88: How quickly can you recoup the 4k?
[5:32:40] Krisgadgets: ask kelly
[5:32:40] AsmoStyle: F.... 3 days
[5:32:43] a_whole_lotta_nope: dont think of it as 3 days, since you get more each day, think of it per day
[5:32:44] pepe_silvia_as: maybe someone can do better than 5
[5:32:44] ImALiar: you can make more in the 3 days getting more jewelry to sell than the 4k
[5:32:46] xvintagearrowsx: you make 4 k over 3 days or make 13k right noe
[5:32:46] niteflyeruzi: You lose about 25%
[5:32:47] alienslx: we need those 3 days to catch up
[5:32:48] jschrage10: he offers 6 say 6.5 or 7
[5:32:49] ShaqMaker: But can you afford to wait 3 whole days
[5:32:51] ruthlessthered: Selling it is not a loss, if you clean it all you lose money because you can't do other shit
[5:32:51] Lunar_Delta: Dont sell all of it.
[5:32:52] voodookangarroo: HUHH BALD
[5:32:52] DOWNBAD_ELLY: Isnt the jewelry 7.5 each??
[5:32:57] lodropna: lazy.....
[5:32:57] ItzKlownie: Is it 3 irl days?
[5:33:03] Thanlen: And, you wouldn’t have to stay active 24/7 for those 3 days and making sure you get in after each storm
[5:33:08] JAYTAZZY: I don’t think 4,000 is that much when you can make that quicker doing more licks
[5:33:13] CamJustVibe: You would make more money selling to him now bc it won't waste all ur time
[5:33:15] voodookangarroo: AWOOGA BALD BALD BALD BALD
[5:33:18] Kinson1: 85 cents on the dollar
[5:33:23] sao_mito: But @whippy if you did everything you would be losing 8k
[5:33:44] lodropna: exact problem dundee did some math KEKW
[5:33:51] Lunar_Delta: Dundees done some math. Thats the problem.
[5:33:57] Kinson1: @ItzKlownie It would take 70 hours to clean the cash. 72hrs = 3 days. So with rounding, yes, would take 3 IRL days
[5:34:11] General_jainobi: Dundee remember Kelly is waiting on you whipSlam
[5:34:14] voodookangarroo: @Lunar_Delta YesYes
[5:34:17] 2Kodak: omg what happened to Dee
[5:34:28] voodookangarroo: @General_jainobi DonkBonk no elp
[5:34:39] C4leb0rn: @2Kodak cops arrested his mullet
[5:34:43] SlashThePriest: 3 irl days, but it's mostly passive
[5:34:45] voodookangarroo: @C4leb0rn D:
[5:34:46] NamelessRumia: whipDerp
[5:34:48] Kinson1: @2Kodak Hiding from a warrant
[5:34:54] 2Kodak: Not the mullet
[5:35:09] ItzKlownie: @Kinson1 Ah ok didn't know if it was by real or game time

[5:36:27] romfi: AAAA
[5:36:38] lone_duck: AHHHHHHH DUNDEE IS BALD
[5:36:42] Kinson1: @ItzKlownie Takes 1 minute to turn 1 rolled bill to 1 cleaned dollar. So that is 60 Cleaned bills an hour, with 5 washing machines, is 300 per hour. If he had 21000 rolls, divide by 300 means 70 hours
[5:36:48] voodookangarroo: AWOOGA BALD
[5:36:59] Fossabot:  whipStinky Please do not tell streamer what to do or how to do it unless specifically asked by streamer, even if he forgets or doesn't see something. Back-seating acts as an unwanted external influence to the roleplay.
