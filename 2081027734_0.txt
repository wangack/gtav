[1:23:44] jvela2123: shift 1 is full of ruth cucks
[1:23:45] Athasin: This convo right here is why I say Denzel going back to shift one is bad idea. Just because Ruth is gone doesn't mean her influence is.
[1:23:46] the_bucket_plays: apparntly not to these two guys
[1:23:47] sonadapop: and he's allowing cops to do bike patrol

[1:24:25] Janman88: well shift one beeing more a "routine" shift with only smaller stuff happening, makes sense
[1:24:27] thebogeym4n: Man, culture in shift 1 is something else
[1:24:28] himalayanre: Kapp
[1:24:31] shosher: I wonder why ruth resigned. because they were pushing charges on her or just because she didnt want the drama
[1:24:32] Zanduin: @quaylewastaken thats actually wrong
[1:24:35] captain_steve_420: Aldo hasnt done anything in 3 days lol

[1:24:41] zoeypeach: Fire shift 1 let the crims have it deansoEvil
[1:24:46] JTheHuntVal: I feel like there are so many new RP viewers who think shift 1 hasn't always been like this. Like this is not a new attitude for 4.0, this shift historically is like this
[1:24:47] CheeseMongerJet: @shosher irl issues
[1:24:48] Athasin: @quaylewastaken Nah they were gonna remove Cornwood's DAPs if he came back unsuspended (Ruth wanted them dropped to 5, but Turner and Slacks said zero)
[1:24:50] combattingjosh: @shosher Wrong. OOC reasons.

[1:24:53] lovelee___: bones would be an awful chief
[1:24:54] LoneSoldier021: Did they have a say in who was promoted to shift 1 intern captain? I don't think so. What makes them think they can vote who's in leadership position

[1:25:35] sophjoestar: A chief should be good in the office not the field NotLikeThis
[1:25:35] Bigeyez: @shosher her in character reason is because she views Berric as a mayoral puppet for investigating her and she won't work for the PD with him as chief. OOC she has family stuff going on.
[1:25:36] Cultivated: LMAO HES SAYING THAT
[1:25:38] lovelee___: it’s an OFFICE job tho????
[1:25:38] mrdudestar: bones has done too many chinese fire drills for chief

[1:25:49] DoktorHealz: yeah give Bearic a chance moron
[1:25:49] garowan: What is he saying?
[1:25:50] Zanduin: field leader = chief of police in a world that never has detectives, bike police, forenscic scientist, etc
[1:25:50] Caml0st: beric denied higher roles in the past
[1:25:50] Dr_Epica: WHAT AINTNOWAY
[1:25:50] Cultivated: gIVE BERIC A TRY THEN
[1:25:51] its_huff_man: it so does Beric, Beric is phenomenal in the field. also bones straight up said he didn’t want to do it
[1:25:51] Chaoszero_goc: What do they think about ruby?
[1:25:53] shosher: you can give him a chance as sergant NOT CHIEF
[1:25:53] TeeRiot: Bones can barely type fast lol
[1:25:53] 2jay_c: this is a communication issue. was meant to be Commissioner, which would’ve been appointed by the Mayor and I think would’ve been a member of the Council. They changed the position to be CoP last minute. I think the intent is for future CoPs to be voted on by RaF cops. Sync the terms with the Mayors and eventual Sheriff.
[1:25:54] zerzz24: BRING BACK KYLE PRED FeelsStrongMan
[1:25:54] thebogeym4n: How does he not know that there were recommendations made by cops being interviewed KEKW

[1:27:17] jvela2123: understandable but he should listen to himself
[1:27:18] XPixelartX: Bones came in 3rd on votes
[1:27:18] OldOhana: only reason he didn’t get a say though is because the PD wasn’t doing it themselves
[1:27:18] lovelee___: they haven’t been around so how would they know
[1:27:18] sophjoestar: LUL LUL
[1:27:19] II__LuKaS__II: Maybe seniors would have a say but other than that a simple foor patrol is to low in the ranks to tell

[1:27:21] Janman88: i mean had shift one ever had alot of pressure? @Deansocool it was usually only tickets and small times shits
[1:27:21] Athasin: @2jay_c It was suppose to CoP, but Dab liked the sound of Commissioner better so during the audit they were calling it Commissioner, then they corrected it back to CoP when Beric was chosen
[1:27:22] sendu6666: @FilzG indeed

[1:28:25] zoeypeach: Bikes ? LUL
[1:28:31] Athasin: @Janman88 Hence why Denzel was doing most of the patroling
[1:28:32] Zanduin: the state mandated the wording change because a commissioner is a mayoral link and a chief of police is someone that the state needs to own
[1:28:35] Cultivated: @TeeRiot Literally three of them were on bikes

[1:43:35] duck_puck1: its not 300k , they didnt use all of it .-.
[1:43:36] Mindhysteria: they already got fucked its just bonus
[1:43:39] TeeRiot: @xXxEV0xXx he did this leon dude knows nothing
[1:43:41] DanLGG: In my opinion Slacks screwed PD over. He knew from day 1 there would be no assistance from the state
[1:43:43] Basard21: leon should really go to meetings
[1:43:43] kCblol: because the 300k was embezzled... LUL cmon supposed to be officers here
[1:43:44] Kelborn: Slacks said they only used 25k
[1:43:51] AsuniRS: This is why people shouldn't miss meetings smh

[1:44:03] DoseofDewey: they only got to pay back 25k
[1:44:04] captain_steve_420: Nekoda screwed up too by asking Etta for the 300k
[1:44:05] howyaben: @Kelborn Then Turner said they used more than that and didn't say how much
[1:44:06] LogicWeasel: @chmod_R_777 Facts
[1:44:07] mrginger101: Nice try there
[1:44:12] Clivent: D:
[1:44:13] spoonsnforks: I don't think anyone has actually told them that it's the State that wants the PD to be self-sufficient.
[1:44:13] Mindhysteria: @Zendorea now that would be content
[1:44:17] Dee__1__: Sanitation cops
[1:44:19] Tsithik: i kinda see this 300k challenge as like a team building exercise for the PD and a test of current CoPs leadership skills
[1:44:20] kahlilgo: the city is down bad
[1:44:21] shadowpuma23: Yea Crane called slacks out in that PD meeting about asking Etta for money after being told no by the state
[1:44:23] Cultivated: They literally being payed for doing completely nothing and they're complaining
[1:44:23] DoseofDewey: cornwood said this yesterday in the meeting lol
[1:44:27] sokjuice: PepeLaugh
[1:44:27] ttdmortality: They should go talk to the mayor to address their concerns or nikota
[1:44:46] searlesbarkleyk: Blaming the state is like blaming admins makes more sense to blame mayor
[1:44:48] marneraiders: Honestly foot patrol isn’t that bad
[1:44:49] chmod_R_777: Classicc SKILL ISSUE... stop crashing your cars
[1:44:51] iSplitSeas: the mayor was pretty much saying if g6 and grime workers pay for. their own upgrades and cars, so should the PD
[1:44:52] ImOome: not realising they have gotten multkple pay raises lol
[1:44:53] judgement_12: @tsithik it isn’t even 300k like 25k was all that was spent

[1:45:13] ClutchMoses: @Cultivated You mean lawyers?
[1:45:13] xXxEV0xXx: @spoonsnforks Them as these guys here? Or pd in general? Cause both the Mayor and Crane went up and said it wasnt up to them it was a state decision.
[1:45:19] ryanrobbo02_: when is acadamy ?
[1:45:20] Clivent: soon TM
[1:45:24] captain_steve_420: Shift 1 leaders havent been keeping them in informed at all
[1:45:26] DanLGG: I told you shift 1 needs you.
[1:45:27] the_bucket_plays: doesnt the council refer to nikota as nikota no balls
[1:45:29] 1CaptainRedBeard1: Got to have a Union, fight for higher pay by threatening strike, take the union dues to fund the PD.
[1:45:32] DanLGG: The morale is down bad
[1:45:33] Happou: No shit they lack some information, it's RP, they don't read meta chats you dumbasses.
[1:45:34] F1ccDaddy: they should learn how to drive, wouldn’t be as expensive 😂
[1:45:35] karaskyee: they major and judge crane were firm about their decision
[1:45:35] marneraiders: Have you talked to the Chief yet ?
[1:45:41] Money2Much: u can just get rehired by asking the mayor like corn wood did
[1:45:44] Astavexa: So state means admins want pd to be self suficient?
[1:45:47] Cultivated: @ClutchMoses I mean thats also true lol I just mean as of right now foot patrol / bike patrol basically useless

[1:45:56] yungnams: the temu special
[1:45:56] combattingjosh: Watches from Wish

[1:46:04] ryanrobbo02_: @mdm4ever1986hd cheers bro
[1:46:04] sokjuice: @Astavexa higher than admin. State in this sense means management/owners
[1:46:07] xseaka: @1CaptainRedBeard1 OOC there will never be a PD union or strikes, they will just get removed
[1:46:08] Athasin: @Cultivated Yeah, interestingly enough it's because of Ruth. No pursuits means no fines, no fines means no 15% commission which means shift 1 is poorer than shift two
[1:46:10] ObnoxiousNinja7: jfc ya'll are still walking
