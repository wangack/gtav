[0:52:19] Metric: Why are they setting a cool historical film as a basic bitch action film
[0:52:24] SkaldFKACC: did guy richie and madonna split up?
[0:52:25] OwenSeven: God these trailers are just so fucking long and there are so many huge moments in here as well like what did we miss? 90 minutes of dialog? I think we just saw 80% of all the action scenes and 1 liners
[0:52:35] SkaldFKACC: is that an over thing now? lol

[1:32:53] timbres: I think being a Nidas viewer is the real hardest job you can have
[1:32:55] EnticingKey: tougher than flying a helicopter?
[1:33:14] rodkorpen: and as a streamer you only sub with sub money, resulting in twitch taking like a 75% cut. quick maffs EZ
[1:33:30] OwenSeven: but honestly it can be if you let it. Its really mentally stressful with inconsistent income and fluctuating viewership with content trends and shit. Is it harder than a real job? no. Is it mentally taxing? ya it really can be
[1:33:46] JackLDN27: @OwenSeven nidasBaby
[1:33:48] ro666ert: yeah after a day watching nidas i can't stand hanging out with friends or family
[1:33:51] EnticingKey: Pog Owen take
[1:33:59] gostonko: wtf is this thought out take
[1:34:00] timbres: Oh cry me a river, we all know you’re both millionaires, how dare you complain
[1:34:01] gostonko: ReallyMad
[1:34:35] OwenSeven: I also think a lot of streamers make it way worse on themselves than it needs to be. THey clock 12 hours a day doing the same shit they've been doing for months or years and is afraid of changing gears or trying new stuff or even just doing shit thats fun for you
[1:34:41] Mavmar: nidas thinks hasan says stupid shit. print it!
[1:35:05] OwenSeven: Like referencing people putting 10 to 15 hours in a day on RP when its clear they're not locked in for it anymore and are afraid of switching off it
[1:35:07] timbres: Shhhh guys don’t talk about Hasan, Gostonko is here

[1:36:44] OwenSeven: I think streaming is a very very easy job but its the time outside of the job that can be really tough if you don't have strong mental (I don't)

[1:41:39] antman059: i hate my job because my work visa confines me to it
[1:41:52] EnticingKey: my job allows me to watch Nidas, best job?
[1:41:55] OwenSeven: what if we all just quit our jobs and pursued streaming
[1:42:02] Mavmar: I do some work with Charities that gives it some meaning but otherwise it feels like work going into a blackhole honestly lol

[1:51:52] bndzor: put it on minus
[1:51:55] NemisizZ: should say + - at least
[1:52:01] Mavmar: it matters, i think. because you cant gave one attched and not the other or it fucks the battery iirc.
[1:52:09] FideICastro_: wait what was the question
