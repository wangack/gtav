[1:50:30] TeaWithBiscuits: They make them when they get to half health
[1:50:30] hunter21111: That happens when they lose most of their hp
[1:50:31] Alicheesy1: yh
[1:50:31] RavenCorp: it does when it gets to half life
[1:50:32] Hamback: yes, when the necrofex gets low on health

[1:51:16] bogex: Imagine being that crew, stuck inside of a walking ship monster
[1:51:18] Tim_Plumbstein: Did Tom just jack sparrow it ?
[1:51:26] LethalTurtle15: it was a thing at release for them
[1:51:26] Deivid2099: Deep down they were gobbos
[1:51:29] power_corveus: huh, I stand corrected. I never noticed it doing that tho
[1:51:31] MahonsTV: @ConfraGundz But I would say that it was not really the hype that killed the sequels since people were okay with the retelling of a new hope but they fucked it with the last jedi since it kinda ended the story because the big bad had been killed
[1:51:42] MillenniumKing: Wait is this a new campaign?
[1:51:43] The_Evil_Scot: The_Evil_Scot subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months, currently on a 6 month streak!

[1:54:34] Grimm_Thorne: How have I not?
[1:54:41] corpseemperorbiden: ya like dags

[1:55:18] TestBot140: @Yogscast "Just shoot them" - Ben, moments before disaster.
[1:55:20] MahonsTV: @ConfraGundz But that happens when you hire a director who does not think in developing a world and only thinks about telling a story
[1:55:22] Rshiel_: @the_snarkiest_hour And that info is probably specific enough that to anyone who cares, I may have doxed myself 😅

[1:57:00] The_Snarkiest_Hour: @Rshiel_ wow! that sounds mega interesting! I bet it was enjoyable to work on! ahahah, if I went any deeper details wise on mine I would 100% dox myself I reckon :L
[1:57:04] MahonsTV: @ConfraGundz Well I would say the most stupid thing about that sith lightning is that the senate got beat by the same move twice LUL

[1:59:23] Rshiel_: @dominosh The lab I was working at probably had around a hundred or so at least, and my supervisor’s theory was that domestication happened in China, so many samples was from there, iirc

[2:04:00] LethalTurtle15: @Yogscast as of the most recent dlc even if you gamble you won't gain or lose. Currently this is the case but ca knows about it. Same with Weapon Strength currently doesn't actually give you the increased damage you get from the buff etc
[2:04:03] Rshiel_: @the_snarkiest_hour It was a healthy mix of interesting and frustrating 😛 The theory and process was awesome, it balancing 32 pairs of nested PCR primers to produce equal amounts of product was quite tedious
[2:04:20] Dominosh: @Rshiel_ IMO your project is just cooler and more useful.

[2:08:59] davelister189: Informe inforyou infor-everybody-in-the-room
[2:09:08] sob590: @rufusomega Anchor them in a unit of syreens and they are one of the best front lines in the game. Especially if you back them up with the lore of vampires. I'd say only ironbreakers do the job better as a frontline for guns and artillery
[2:09:12] corpseemperorbiden: when in elf land
[2:09:15] Cindipool: It's very expensive to do it with fleet captains.
[2:09:16] georgehehheh: pedLaugh pssssh
[2:09:25] Sapathwa: what made you pick pirates again?
[2:09:25] paletuna: I remember last sword of khaine saga, that was a ride
[2:09:30] Cindipool: And they have a ridiculously long cooldown.
[2:09:34] ConfraGundz: The cursed sword is one of my favorite tropes ever
[2:09:35] Grimm_Thorne: I think that's called Durthu...
[2:09:47] Vanysh: The sword requires melee combat to recharge though, kinda not what you want on the collossus
[2:09:54] Khazaar: Do they have the 10% movementspeed? Toms sitting in front of it...
[2:10:08] SerLoinSteak: Colossus + Widowmaker = Better Durthu

[2:13:42] georgehehheh: yogREE FAK OFF
[2:13:42] Sir_Louis: Race law? monkaS
[2:13:42] MahonsTV: @SerLoinSteak I mean Count noctilus is ranged with the necrofex and to recharge the power you need to be in melee and since the grom the paunch bugs makes it so that weapon strength does not actually get increased or decreased the sword of khaine only has the ward save and the spell
[2:13:54] SeeingEyeSnail: morter to slap archers
[2:13:58] Darrullo: thanks @Faaafv
[2:14:06] sob590: @mahons12 The weapon strength bug is fixed on the beta
[2:14:21] MahonsTV: @sob590 I do not think they are on the beta
[2:14:22] sammjawr: of all the stats to get bugged
[2:14:31] solacepyre: Are either of you going to play Mount and Blade: Bannerlord? Would love a T+B stream of it

[2:14:58] MahonsTV: @solacepyre Tom played it on his twitch channel when it came out
[2:15:00] ground_to_air_potato: yep
[2:15:01] SerLoinSteak: @Mahons12 I haven't been in a position to get the SoK in a while so I didn't know it was bugged
[2:15:03] marthyuu: The great potato launcher!
[2:15:09] MillenniumKing: @ground_to_air_potato youve been an artiliary before right?
[2:15:21] sob590: @mahons12 oh that's a shame! I guess vampire coast are a pretty good faction to play without the beta though since they don't really rely on weapon strength bonuses very much
[2:15:30] Lazy_on_Twich: Bravely playing zombie pirates, +1
[2:15:33] MahonsTV: @SerLoinSteak it is not just the sword of khaine but ANY weapon strength decrease or increase
[2:15:33] Diamon_Boots: If there ever is someone with boots you know who to call TehePelo
[2:15:35] thehelpfulmuffin: murderface murderface murderface
[2:15:38] 0wlnix: Bloat death \o/
[2:15:45] Frooba3: Those Castrati look great!
[2:15:54] ground_to_air_potato: yes got killed last week @millenniumking
[2:15:55] sammjawr: there's only one army right? so if we had a unit already it is probably dead now? yogBog
[2:16:15] MahonsTV: @sob590 I will guess it does not affect ranged damage but only weapon strength
[2:16:18] The_Snarkiest_Hour: That castrati is superb! needs more veins though
[2:16:33] Venom52: their lord is only level 1 as well
[2:16:42] SerLoinSteak: @Mahons12 oh shit. I never noticed
[2:16:43] sammjawr: Noctilues looks very green and pink, like a fairy
[2:16:44] sob590: @mahons12 Yeah that's correct. Ranged weapon strength bonuses work properly
[2:16:46] BigGinger__: what is up fellow kids
[2:16:48] Aadam78692: Wait is this D-Day?
[2:17:00] Diamon_Boots: Are there any other types of zombies?
[2:17:07] MahonsTV: @sob590 So it only really affects melee lords

[2:17:33] TheMenister: man but when handguns start to outrange the elf archers with the upgrades, that's a FeelsGoodMan
[2:17:41] MahonsTV: @Yogscast You CANNOT get less
[2:17:42] commandermagpie: "I want to avoid and Elf War"...Two Hours Later...
[2:17:53] MahonsTV: @Yogscast It cannot change at all
[2:18:11] Khazaar: Use the woods for your shitty infantry to draw their fire, less damage
[2:18:14] Darrullo: @Yogscast no tom they are saying "dickhands" remember
[2:18:23] sob590: @mahons12 Anything that relies on charge bonus is affected too since you don't get the bonus weapon strength from charges on the live patch. Greenskins are hurt a lot by it too since a lot of scrap upgrades give weapon strength
[2:18:23] Cindipool: Who will you annoy instead of elves?
[2:18:36] SerLoinSteak: @Yogscast Mahons12 is right, it will never change when you gamble

[2:20:33] georgehehheh: LUL
[2:20:35] sob590: @mahons12 Yeah. I think it's also part of the reason why orc units felt a lot worse than they should. They rely a lot more on charge and weapon strength bonuses than goblin spearmen do!
[2:20:36] ConfraGundz: I would drink the shit out of a warpstone energy drink

[3:15:18] ConfraGundz: Its a group of inquisitors that work with devils to deal with demins
[3:15:18] HOBBKNACASS: I personally like the witcher version of fantasy, which is only a few people know how to use magic and such and the rest of humanity are just humans scared to even leave their village.

[3:54:09] mortition: @Lettsalta if I red ben's lips, there is a lag in the image compared to the sound
[3:54:10] Danny83uk: Do you guys plan to play the new Necromunda game?
[3:54:24] RufusTheHairyCatWrangler: and Throgg, iirc
[3:54:26] LoopStricken: The visual lag isn't huge, but it is offputting.
[3:54:28] Rshiel_: It was glorious in its doomborning
[3:54:33] power_corveus: Norsca was a stomping victory i'm pretty sure. Like, you beat chaos
[3:54:34] Ushotan: @mortition Yeah i have it as well, now refreshing doesnt work anymore either. There is an annoying delay no matter what i do LUL
[3:54:35] mrcoffeebeans_: LUL
[3:54:39] Rshiel_: But we had mammoths!
[3:54:42] smurgledwerf: bloat bois are great against the gates
[3:54:45] XanderOfBritain: LUL
[3:54:59] ColoradoBrownstain: Actually the real warhammer map is a tesseract, so you're just looking at different projections.
[3:55:01] ManicMolesa: i would sub for that
[3:55:06] power_corveus: maybe Im confusing it with my own norsca campaign wich was a complete victory
[3:55:06] smurgledwerf: use the bloat boi on the gate, it'll also damage units on top of it
[3:55:19] Erhard_: "Oh look, here Tom goes again, killing innocent animals"
[3:55:48] Ossac_: is it just me or are the voices out of sync with the mouths
[3:56:08] MillenniumKing: out of sync for me too
[3:56:12] RufusTheHairyCatWrangler: Welp, sounds like the storm has reached north London
[3:56:16] ManicMolesa: count choculus
[3:56:21] Erhard_: Yeah they are out of sync
[3:56:26] MillenniumKing: no its be nout of sync all strream
[3:56:27] pastabus_: Just going for a walk
[3:56:36] proflix: as useful as a bloato would be for the gates, if he gets shot it's just a wasted bloat
[3:56:43] honeybutterbread: tom and ben mouth/audio are out of sync
[3:56:44] viliah: Why not run the doggos around to the other gate to attacc it?
[3:57:04] honeybutterbread: just a tiny bit
[3:57:09] ManicMolesa: that's what the skaven ones do
[3:57:13] Cindipool: Just fire through your own lines, nobody important is standing there.
