[2:04:59] hakz5: much*
[2:05:23] luued: its hard to say what a good price is without talking to a bunch of people first about renting
[2:05:25] BayneGaming: them ppl gotta make 1k a day
[2:06:23] boomershow824: The people that can afford that rent will probably just buy their own house
[2:06:23] BayneGaming: lol
[2:06:57] mjtorn: also cops don‚Äôt have use for the houses, like crims or civs do, the benches and computer desks and such
[2:07:03] internalin: that's like 10 months of rent to buy the place
[2:07:18] mjtorn: so crims/civs they should be more willing to rent.
[2:07:22] Sp0rtsjunki3: Devs should incentivize people to move out of apartments. Maybe make their earning rate a bit higher or something
[2:07:26] boomershow824: Grinders are prob the best bet. Cops don't really need a house for anything
[2:07:33] NoahS116: I feel like people don‚Äôt realize how easy it is to make 5k a week. I know the cops make way more than that too so not sure why they are trying to be so stingy

[2:56:14] Jackmadman: Flooring cost of 30k and house price. Next 1 got be 35k+ might need be 40k

[2:57:41] WhoNeedsBullets: the problem is what does the average player on the server do KEKW
[2:57:52] Lavitzboss: I don't know how much money people have atm. You guys have been draining all the high net worth individuals in the city
[2:57:57] R3dl1nes: it was 169 with tax 202 but now it went up not long after k started ti 171 =/ insane
[2:58:14] tim_schu: @WhoNeedsBullets they do 3 packer runs to pay their rent? they work 5 hours at snr buns? in a WEEK
[2:58:15] Lavitzboss: Might need to wait some time before the next property to buy
[2:58:16] tim_schu: very doable
[2:58:28] ccoolracer128: i wouldnt leave that in there
[2:58:33] WhoNeedsBullets: @WhoNeedsBullets average players cant even access the packer
[2:58:49] ccoolracer128: if the server restarts you will lose it all that
[2:59:02] tim_schu: @WhoNeedsBullets then those players live in the apartments
[2:59:25] WhoNeedsBullets: @WhoNeedsBullets thats the problem. i'd say a high percentage of the server is that way
[2:59:27] deadzonegaming80: timmac with the sexy voice
[2:59:34] Jackmadman: So with tax you need like 18%-20% to break even on the house

[3:00:09] R3dl1nes: @Jackmadman plus any spent on building the insides too
[3:00:12] Blue_Walsh: Would "writing on the wall" who's money and how much is in there be enough for people to honor it?
[3:00:39] Jackmadman: @r3dl1nes oh yeah with 30k floor cost you double the %
[3:00:42] WhoNeedsBullets: @WhoNeedsBullets we see streamers on the cutting edge and assume most other people are the same... 75% of the server is doing what these guys did in the first 4 days
[3:00:58] Jackmadman: So 36% to 40% F
[3:01:19] R3dl1nes: that bare min tbh
