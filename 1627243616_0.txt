[1:58:04] mMRrAnderson: @Goldfish_Vendor most new arcade machines use emulators for obvious reasons
[1:58:07] elle_nero: mm, all you need is a license key from eBay (from a decommissioned machine) and call Microsoft to register it
[1:58:07] Best_CONFIDENCE: If you‚Äôd want to fix it you can install something like Linux and install retro pie. It‚Äôll let you play all those games and stuff and don‚Äôt have to by the copy. Will require some learning though on the settings
