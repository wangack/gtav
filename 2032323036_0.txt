[5:57:02] Rascal_PM: !iq
[5:57:02] TheGoatstare: GTA charge LUL
[5:57:02] Streamlabs: Dean says his Iq is 104 but he took a test on stream on Sept 5, 2021 and got 35. YES 35, he took another test on Dec 10, 2021 and got 121. He did another test on March 20, 2023 and got 107 (with a CALCULATOR) Pepega
[5:57:20] 8Bit_Cactus: depends on who you watch. @thatguydancingintheclub
[5:57:36] bobbybeee: charge was on wrong report
[5:57:42] AlienatedFL: Crazy that you get DAP 1 point for charge stacking cause that's a state attorney issue
[5:57:48] AlienatedFL: and they dont even have a DA
[5:57:53] Rascal_PM: I love that they sound like they agree with you, these are good people
[5:57:56] MOODYSARCASTICCNT: @thatguydancingintheclub sidemen get bare views on among us
[5:57:58] Fred_Leb2: your stacking DAP was from the GTA case you went to court for
[5:58:00] momzzyy: its a BS DAP
[5:58:06] pr0digy_1: except the gun
[5:58:21] FelQueen: Also Judge angel looks like she's corrupt, she has close relationships with snitches like ramsey

[5:58:44] tob0123: tob0123 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months, currently on a 1 month streak!

[5:58:49] Athasin: @momzzyy So was the DAP for not giving Nunu medical at scene when he was surrounded by 13 hostiles
[5:58:49] 1CaptainRedBeard1: That's nuts.
[5:58:53] mynameismikeyd: wait...... wasn't the daps for charge stacking and handing over the report to ramee without captain consent?

[5:59:28] Rascal_PM: @pr0digy_1 no, they are taking about the robbery of the police officer, and in court they can argue that the person exchanging money for the gun was admitting they had the gun
[5:59:33] momzzyy: @Athasin tru I think getting away from a hostile area then getting medical would be fine but guess not
[5:59:42] Athasin: @mynameismikeyd Nope, it was poor paperwork, and mishandling an appeal process
