[1:17:00] chadowen: Biggest difference between a cult and religion? One gets a tax write-off and the other gets busted by the feds.
[1:17:09] Baphmo: It can be a nice hobby but you gotta be realistic about it. I love demonology and old Celtic tales, I'd call that spiritual but I know it's just stories
[1:17:11] Drenh: religion is just a bigger cult socialy accepted
[1:17:16] Jam_Plays_Games: As a religious person the line is unfortunately very blurred
[1:17:22] kaiser_fecalfunny: Mormons feel far more like a cult than religion
[1:17:25] Czar_6996: More too life than things and money. People will form cults over shit like that
[1:17:26] 42mart42: @Rocker2999 basically yeah, they religions often shed their most cult like behaviours over time
[1:17:27] spamd0wn: @mcnuggernut which ones?
[1:17:28] SILENT_W4LF: religions are more of a socially accepted cult
[1:17:30] metricmeasurement: religions are just established through time. they all start essentially the same way

[1:55:55] LazySamurai: LC streams were one the funniest ive seen in years
[1:55:56] at_witzend: Lethal Comp just because it was good content constantly. Baldur’s gate was a great game, but I never saw it as a streaming game even though people have streamed it.
[1:55:56] DanneMM: BG3 i think ive watched 100 hours of the first act and nothing of the other acts.

[7:21:05] interiorcastle: i bet a lot of the doctors here were premed LUL
[7:21:18] KisaiTenshi: IMO, maybe the supplies have to be bought out of pocket, but you get a refund on the supplies you used when the "patient" pays the bill.
[7:21:19] trankesdello: Group wouldn't like that too prob
[7:21:19] javikaston: oh yeah doctorgang
[7:21:20] MrByte: Tech was a mistake. Return to cabin.
[7:21:24] jcara514: Geega really co-aligning with my interests in biology and tech
[7:21:30] Stone_Frostbrew: I'm interested to see how the management thing you talked to Lang about and his "God we need that" will work out.
[7:21:32] Battenhall: she probably bored LUL
[7:21:38] TheGunnyMac: Diversifying the gang skill set is cool. But forcing one to stay in a hospital for hours if you don't enjoy it is ookie

[7:43:46] Mr_Feyshade: A young sailor walks into a bar, and the only patron is an old salt with a peg leg, a hook, & an eye patch. The young man approaches and asks how someone gets in his condition. The old pirate says, "A cannonball took me leg when I was in the navy." "And the hook?" "After I left the navy, I was a pirate, and a fellow buccaneer took it in a bar fight with his cutlass." "That's amazing!" Says the young man, "What amazing thing caused the eyepatch?"
