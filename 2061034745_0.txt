[0:53:13] WinterForged: Did you sleep?
[0:53:16] nuudelz: 6g a truesilver bar LUL
[0:53:18] LifeisPogChamp: they need a reset for economy
[0:53:19] God_is_a_cat_girl: the funny thing about the Knight stuff is that no one points out Cornwood yelling he can't cuff and no one does anything, like bruh LULW
[0:53:19] Janman88: same will happen with nopixel PepeLaugh
[0:53:21] YoshiTheDeeno: what is sod @EsfandTV
[0:53:21] EclecticMotives: LUL
[0:53:22] hereforff9: In GTA5?
[0:53:26] thebigshabam: yea they spent wayy too long in p1 and the game is sht nobody streams it
[0:53:27] sunlitebro: SOD?
[0:53:27] sidewinder937_: yeah it doesnt feel like classic
[0:53:28] Vorpalwarp: in Wotlk in the vanilla world
[0:53:28] Angelumortis: Ehhh SoD has been kinda iffy, no urge to play recently
[0:53:31] sunlitebro: SOD is wrath?
[0:53:34] Dumpins1023: phase 2 is pretty Bedge for me
[0:53:37] Monksden: took too long, now I lost interest in SOD.  TBH I am not enjoying it
[0:53:38] HooShKab00sh: SoD is literally best WoW
[0:53:40] Kfoo_: SOD is classic +
[0:53:40] MormonJeezy: sounds like people Discovered it wasn't what they thought it was
[0:53:40] halfbakedcake: P2 is fine but Boomkins are absolutely busted
[0:53:41] finalfork: it is a bit much
[0:53:41] Mic_Stargazer: Like right now Mechanic as an RP job is worthless, allt he shops are losing money on repairs because of material pricing being better used elsewhere
[0:53:42] Frozen_Tundras: the quest gold was also insane. caused a lot of inflation.
[0:53:43] ZachFromChat: I have a guild called <Mage> on crusader strike and we just do 5x mage clears in like 5 minutes... gold is trivialized
[0:53:45] Fresh_Born: the new abilities give so much power, but people are still gear checking for stocks
[0:53:45] nuudelz: gameplay is great its just the other barriers
[0:53:45] smashkan: SoD doesnt have enough new, even like SM and stuff is the same. its lame
[0:53:46] Rebsdorf_TFT: YEP
[0:53:46] Perterter: 2000%. I quit because the economy is deaaad. You have to buy gold to actually play now
[0:53:46] pezboy1989: why the old car?
[0:53:47] Fakomi: some classes play  a lot like their wrath versions
[0:53:47] chiperd: Get a nice nap in lol

[0:53:53] MoohamedAlii: Are you talking about wow or gta? @EsfandTV
[0:53:53] sunlitebro: Hmm
[0:53:58] Xormas: i was never able to get into wow but im glad people  are still enjoying it
[0:54:00] GoofyMaskedGoober: @MoohamedAlii palworld
[0:54:01] NoGrave: think they are linking the 'lore' to War Within... With the Crystal in Hills
[0:54:02] Maclonie: I miss the wow streams ); full character immersion
[0:54:02] Orbilion: sbs > sod
[0:54:03] AvianOfKonoha: @EsfandTV did the bench trial for the stabber happen already?
[0:54:07] notColt45: At least they added a fun boss fight of Mimiron Light in Gnomer
[0:54:07] Janman88: @Vexamas hey that migh be true but he still played it alot at some point and as more "casual" its still a valid opionion
[0:54:08] jburke23: I'm going to be honest I think this PD is screwed. Was watching Saab's discussion and for an RP server shits way too serious
[0:54:09] heavyd834: yeah I hate what they're doing with SoD, I wish they would just tweak hybrid classes and leave the rest of classic alone
[0:54:12] SouthPaw1724: AYAYA
[0:54:12] Khaosshinobi: @thebigshabam because the state budget affects every thing now, it affects officers, EMS, businesses, etc, so the devs put price tags on cars and stuff and makes everyone have to work for the money to get new cars YEP
[0:54:12] MakiWind: Does cornwood now about D
[0:54:13] nesDk: @Kfoo_ I think its called Small Brain Syndrome

[0:54:19] GorSTL: at this point i have a hard time considering going back to normal classic wow after SOD
[0:54:20] thebigshabam: they have wayyy too many restrictions on p2 with profs and drops, although they are supporting shockadin as a viable spec this phase
[0:54:22] Jibkit: LULW As a none wow player all this is a little confusing, can't wait for them to announce "WoW Classic Classic"
[0:54:22] MoohamedAlii: AYAYA uwu

[1:25:17] Kelborn: @EsfandTV Its not just procedural. There is an element of RP courtesy that doesn't exist with some players. They don't think about the consequences on the other side of their roleplay decisions. They only think about the bottom line for themselves.
[1:25:18] SavageTarzan: lookUp

[1:25:47] TheLlamaTrainer: It also relies on crims crimming in good faith. WHen they get caught "I cant remember" something that happened 5 mins ago should be a guilty plea. They arent even arguing their case
[1:25:48] kylef_: wouldn't the sheriff's office not solve much if it's united with the pd? or would you still have more freedom

[3:24:10] TheKingOfWit: Lets go, readd the charges
[3:24:11] Switchblade142: @StillStormX I mean they were detained because they all said they were the person that was under investigation for a crime. Thats a legal detainment and gives him reasonable suspicion.

[3:56:30] MrViceNice: He cant 78 as he is proccessing
[3:56:30] greyjulian: @xgameshock but crime is going to get boring if there is zero risk, PD is so downbad that civilians don’t even dial 911 sometimes
[3:56:31] aztec8669: wtf you mean you guys lol  its 1 dude

[3:56:32] adaa12345678: they have been giving slaps on the wrist for weeks and the criminals have jsut been getting bolder xdd
[3:56:32] Jetrospect: Jason Polam would be proud of what Cornwood is pushing for
[3:56:33] Rastafiki: you 100% correct, keep up the good work.
[3:56:34] MakingMischiefs: This is why they can do what they want, punishments dont fit the crime
[3:56:35] joeseph00: sometimes u gotta be a hardass and people just gonna be mad
[3:56:35] Toastedgamer03: @Connorbrow i mean slacks is right charges wise just the charge needs a lot of a bigger fine
[3:56:36] EnReeKay_: Solution: give him the 9s
[3:56:37] TehDobster: Arrested for extortion then charged for extortion, whats the issue?? @EsfandTV

[3:56:56] PacGamer: OneGuy
[3:56:57] Bhasgreth: Chat. Fines/Prison Time don't match the crimes. Police have to do like 3 hours of paperwork, 3 hours of court over a $600 fine.
[3:56:59] freaking_nerd: you say that but it took you 1 hour to give him the charge
[3:57:02] Mastodonian: @OvenEnvironmental final fantasy 7

[3:57:15] PacGamer: YEP
[3:57:16] harrytitsmitchell: the best we can hope for is holding them as long as possible in this back and forth. that's what's really BASED
[3:57:16] Bhasgreth: have to make crime risky and worth police time to investigate
[3:57:22] arsenicpanda01: @EsfandTV Just lock everyone up and charge stack them all shits too crazy now
[3:57:22] OvenEnvironmental: @Mastodonian thank you!
[3:57:22] JakeStratic: Slacks doesn't 'change his mind' especially when his made a mistake. He NEVER does or will man. Not sure if it is his RP or what @EsfandTV
[3:57:30] dudemanbroo: important to note they were wearing masks as well
[3:57:34] Sun_Rah: GIGACHAD
[3:57:34] Crazyoldfool: the timed served stuff blows. its takes longer to process them than the sentencing
[3:57:37] w111iam1: @dudemanbroo yeah if they’re free make ‘em shitty lawyers
[3:57:37] VivaLaValle: fkn morons arent even accepting 14 month deals
[3:57:38] RietArtwork: it makes a lot of sense to me man, I think part of the chat is either trolling or are criminals
[3:57:38] bbfnotch: Hookem an bookem
[3:57:42] Mawkatz: @dudemanbroo not only are they expensive but they are immune to most things at the moment cause there is such a lack of people playing them.
[3:57:49] greyjulian: LEGOnardo Slack, emphasis on the ego part
[3:57:51] floccumate: you asked before and after detainment
[3:57:53] Dynomyth: You do RP right and the other RP pros know it, some chatters don't understand that
[3:57:53] prodigy746: @JakeStratic If you been watching yes its his character RP always has been
[3:57:58] bertacharm: Classic snr buns trip turning into hours
[3:58:08] EvilCoatrack: they were very insistent on obstructing justice
[3:58:12] Dumboodaking: @shojoblanket exactly, because the laws are so literal that anything can be argued and if you can't prove something without a reasonable doubt, they will get off completely.
[3:58:15] urbansquatch: they all said they were him like 30 times lol
[3:58:18] shojoblanket: y’all need bodycams lmao
[3:58:21] Mawkatz: @prodigy746 He does, but then he gets spiteful and actually daps himself
[3:58:33] ABirky: Didn't Cornwood have to go up to the farm a bit ago???
[3:58:36] Bhasgreth: @Dumboodaking pretty much the same thing IRL, evidence over hear say tbh
[3:58:45] UgotSNUKED: @shojoblanket body cam feature would be fire 🔥 actually
[3:58:47] dollar_25: @ABirky taxi got lost
[3:58:50] dudemanbroo: god I hate Oliver as a character 😂
[3:58:52] Dumboodaking: @Bhasgreth the difference is, the limiting factor is game mechanics not allowing them to actually do policing.
[3:58:53] ABirky: ah understandable
[3:58:55] zilaprime: Ramee in the back BabyRage BabyRage
[3:58:59] Connorbrow: @toastedgamer03 He could have had a possession charge. And should have had an obstruction, license and harrasment charge if Slacks hadn't taken lead on his charges.
[3:59:01] SarahFlare: after obstructing justice
[3:59:06] doesvoodoo: Susge cornwoods voice has changed
[3:59:06] Mawkatz: @Dumboodaking its way more than that
[3:59:10] BraerHZ: if he id's himself as vivek before you see the ID, then he was either lying or not in a clear state of mine
[3:59:12] Bhasgreth: @Dumboodaking true, i think they're slowly adding all those mechanics over time, just not at all once unfortunately
[3:59:14] TheKingOfWit: A judge would threathen to disbar this guy for his logic
[3:59:15] Cheechill: Like a well oiled machine
[3:59:16] ThronDon: this guys a cheech

[4:05:03] ComaToasted: doesn't the jail spoil faster though?
[4:05:04] JakeStratic: @Beerbuddie He let him off on a felony and wants them to go to jail for wasting so much time... i mean - it is good RP and a tiny win for the cops for all the BS

[4:05:07] dudemanbroo: @esfandtv los santos needs trial by combat
[4:05:08] sevenevilmuffins: Going to jail is part of the role play for doing a crime. It should be some horrible thing for the actual person playing to have to do
[4:05:08] Wintyer2: Crime just wasted an hour of Cornwoods time could have plead guilty and been out in 24 min
