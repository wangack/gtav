[3:43:24] Vvvviinnccee: it is
[3:43:24] ParaSocialVieweR1: 1 for 1 is bad, they don't gain anything
[3:43:25] scarface2769: 1 for 1 is fine
[3:43:26] AidenPNW: they dont benefit from the trade at all
[3:43:27] BoxFan112: @moneybroskis Yeah thats why they are only one away from completing lol like what?? haha

[3:43:29] moneybroskis: @BOOOMIC how did you manage to get mad at that comment I'm sorry?
[3:43:29] GigaChaaaaaaaaad: starting 2 for 1 sounds desperate
[3:43:30] waelynx7: you are demanding

[3:43:38] 11_cliff: They'll get excited for 2 for 1
[3:43:40] quietesfaye: LETHIMCOOK
[3:43:40] marz777: For small groups it is
[3:43:40] Gamatori: its a powerdynamics
[3:43:41] Deliciou5: it’s more that like a swap? they won’t have duplicates 😂
[3:43:41] Shaphilly_: @moneybroskis then move on and find something else to do.
[3:43:41] zeristt: micheys right

[3:43:59] alpasoup1: mickey is 100% not right
[3:43:59] VallarFax_: its only equal if they also have a dupe but if not then they are just heloing you
[3:44:01] ZK4i: either way with JPs group is bad
