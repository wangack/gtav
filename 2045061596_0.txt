[5:33:12] SlimShady899: @Pheyerus, The time isn't the biggest issue. It's definitely a big one for people who watch a lot of Twitch, but there's also the problem of pre-roll ads. They will play before you are able to view stream to check out the content and it causes many viewers to leave immediately. Plus the mid-roll ads constantly are very intrusive.
