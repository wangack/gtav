[0:26:47] Trauerdurst_TD3D: i'd say thats Hulk Hogan, not the rock tho but i'm also in my 40s so this might be a genarational thing
[0:26:59] UhThisIsNick: TNA over WWE
[0:27:11] Frozen_yakman: these days it might be Cena?

[0:28:09] owenwilliams367: I love his Instagram page
[0:28:10] SomebodyCalledNove: @imnot_mason cena has kind of changed from wrestler to movie star or whatever else he's done
[0:28:18] Waxed_Wing: He is such a good actor, I love how he gets into the role always
[0:28:22] bypha: Cena collaborates so much with the Make a Wish foundation, its insane
[0:28:26] baldguyenjoyer: To be fair, Cena is starting to get A-list Hollywood gigs, something Hogan never really did
[0:28:28] sp1rit_lol: okay, Cena's last insta is funny as shit.
[0:28:35] imnot_mason: @SomebodyCalledNove id argue the rock is more of a movie star than john cena
[0:28:37] owenwilliams367: His recent Instagram post LUL
[0:28:40] sp1rit_lol: The Rock would have been the entire movie if he had a cameo

[0:29:11] Xathz: What was that action series that cena was in? He did really well in that
[0:29:11] reii_o_o: You can't see him
[0:29:15] SomebodyCalledNove: @imnot_mason yeah, ok he was in a disney animated film for his start of his film career

[0:29:34] euphoriaticumpulses: There's the but.
[0:29:44] sp1rit_lol: this Rock vs Roman should have happened at the start of the Tribal Chief, not near the end.
[0:29:45] z1r0_sn0w: Truly, he really isn't doing anything worthwhile. He just needs to let it be lol

[0:30:32] johno27: As a marvel fanboy I wanted to hate peacemaker but Cena won me over in like 15 minutes
[0:30:33] sp1rit_lol: Triple Threats are over done atm
[0:30:33] bypha: @hunterengell thats just covid doing its thing dw
[0:30:40] surf_rose: The only good one was WrestleMania 20
[0:30:41] AJayyRP: Rock will be the guest ref to stop Solo interfering is my guess for sure
[0:30:43] CMMatero: He is doing what he couldn't do in the DC universe, putting himself in charge of the creative part, putting himself in the middle of the attention
[0:30:43] saveajoe: TLC?
[0:30:47] devilemoni: opinion of stone cold?

[1:01:56] faireous: Best I can do is $13.50
[1:02:00] RARA_cht: I think that criticism is for long term renters. I know of family friends that rented for 20 years. At that point get a mortgage and leave behind something for your kids lmao
[1:02:04] WtFShuk: Canada is fucked for housing i live in a 1millin shit box
[1:02:07] LeftyyOK: it makes no sense to rent where I am, I own my home, pay 886 a month.  When renting a house the same as mine, is 1800 a month, it's fucking bonkers.

[1:02:45] upoxygen: I think everywhere is in a housing crisis atm
[1:02:48] VoiceOverGrey: I think the negative Stigma around renting comes from the shitty landlords who charge $1000 a month for a one bed one bath apartment with no utilities and steals your security deposit
[1:02:52] mandonumberthree: Ngl, I want to move out of my parents house (I’m 18) but in Colorado the housing is ridiculous, even apartments are over priced, like a standard 4 bedroom house is 1 million here

[1:03:14] buchaboi: Didn't that dude go completely bankrupt from that house? Literally ruined his life. Whoever bought it probably got a really good deal
[1:03:15] SomebodyCalledNove: @k1eron29 now that is funny very funny

[1:04:38] Thred4: richard garriot aka lord biriths
[1:04:40] owain_the_comrade: Buying houses like that is an argument for higher taxes on the rich

[1:04:50] francisyuu: youre not missing much in a big city
[1:04:54] Hellblazer_Hawkman: @ArtisticAngler Happened in california too because those folks had their own personal fire fighter squads for their mansions
