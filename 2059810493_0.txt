[4:26:08] zenatr: SHe's going on about the journey but skipped 2 months of it to get to the gun destinaton
[4:26:13] MJ77seven: YEP
[4:26:16] BladedBuzzer: the city doesn't stop just cause you've not been arounds sadly
[4:26:18] mugcostanza: Kass could've prevented a lot of it
[4:26:19] dume5330: kass technically didn't even personally say she wanted guns
[4:26:25] noKaminari: The barrels in front of the house put in more work than May
[4:26:26] MaffieNZ: Kass not making it clear what she wants is another issue for
[4:26:28] Boltaction_Babe: yepp
[4:26:28] Tronno: kyliebSip
[4:26:31] SpectreUK: Kass and JJ talk to eachother about their issues but not to the people involved
[4:26:31] xshiva_: i think she wants to be with other people
[4:26:33] ewoudkoster: after saying we need to express feelings and then not talk about the feelings it was kinda weird ngl
[4:26:34] rubberrazors: it's Kass, the ying to JJ's big mouth yang
[4:26:34] KurtJames: Good thing May was never sworn in right?
[4:26:37] RoyLeeTV: cass is very cooperative , and non confrontational
[4:26:43] NotBetsy: yeah. I mean the JJ said some things were questionable, but Mary saw that part.
[4:26:43] tedium7: nodd very odd, journey should be enjoyable from someone who wasnt' even there
[4:26:43] Calgoesmooo: kass agreed that jj needs to be open and bottle things up but didnt herself
[4:26:44] darkestnight333: because the first meeting she didn't have to, Kass was told she would be over it and May would be working with her under her so she didn't need to pipe up
[4:26:45] AetherMana: Burnt out at the wrong time
[4:26:47] TheFightspit: She talked about the journey but she skipped it Kappa
[4:26:53] poppins1729: Kass speaking late is the reason why JJ had to take that stance, speech -100 but empathy +100
[4:26:54] spicychickenzz: sounded like JJ was speaking up for Kass
[4:26:56] Isen_Mage: JJ was focused on the journey regardless of what it ended at. May was looking for a destination first Shrug
[4:26:56] czhilli: May said it herself. In a gang her and JJ  are just going to keep clashing because of their personalities. Best they
[4:26:59] DaeDae87: Devil's advocate though, what are you meant to do in the case you miss out two months? What is she expected to do to be on the same footing as other members of the group that have been there?
[4:27:06] ViolentAkuma: The burden of leading a group. You had a soft spot for her when in reality you should have kicked her.
[4:27:06] czhilli: stay apart
[4:27:17] ibruticus: working under Kass and helping to eventually maybe be equals was the play but she just didn't want that so o7
[4:27:19] stylzo_: i think she was really entitled as kinmaru + marys sister that she just can demand it at least it felt like to me Hmm

[5:09:08] nimshot: Could something quick be made on the Mosleys billing "backend" where you simply post "notes"?
[5:09:12] ThePitfallover: we're using LSH as a catchall, we wouldn't need multiple discords to be managed
[5:09:17] Myki_Cameda: Is there a place in the Wbsite to leave messages for stuff like that?
[5:09:19] Fr0stwav3: just do it at this point, and if there is an in game alternative in the future swap to that nodd
[5:09:21] lagunavex: what is the difference between a website and a discord for the business? Would be my view
[5:09:42] stylzo_: @de5f on the pc yes but its a huge security leak since it requires the mechanics to have access to a house
[5:09:47] Vadoctrax: Putting it on the website could work for announcements.
