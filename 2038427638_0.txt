[2:40:32] 607snapperz: @Mandan0, crouching does not make hitbox smaller in gta
[2:40:35] WardenOfTheSwans: will the server room be too small very soon? is there a plan on how to expand it in the basement?
[2:40:38] maksschmidt2: @officialsadman yeah, but that assumes you have them perfectly aligned. which visually looks fine for those two but the error can accumulate over a long distance

[5:04:14] kingbeerx: Too soon people are broke even groups after buying cars and such
[5:04:14] ZippoMan18: who else would sell them?
[5:04:14] michelino19957: keeping it and stacking but is prolly more worth than selling for less imoù
[5:04:15] erquilene: its cuz everyone got cars
[5:04:15] iTzJboot: bro everyones buyying cars and ish. they got the money.
[5:04:16] fambaa: @Ray__C you could try selling just the BP for 20
[5:04:16] GoldBeastx: did you fix the racks room?
[5:04:16] Rimassik: If you think that's too much add something for free
[5:04:17] blackoutguru7: @ray__c DO FINANCING

[5:04:19] cSpiny: if they buy 2 give them a 22 deal
[5:04:20] WORLDSTARROCKSTAR: nah 25 is reasonable
[5:04:20] yellernanners: it costs 12ish butc to even have access to the bp
[5:04:21] deadeye_jr: !backseat
[5:04:21] RaycBot: backseat gaming gets annoying and may result to accidental !meta. This includes telling Ray how to RP and what to do next. Excessive backseat gaming may result in a timeout or ban without warning. So chill and enjoy the show. Thank you. STFU
[5:04:23] aro_1995: let them all grind lol
[5:04:24] kaemezeta: 20k is good too, 10k per butcoin @Ray__C
[5:04:25] unknown_do3: it triples their efficiency so 25k is good asf
[5:04:26] rauul7734: yes patience
[5:04:26] grifspdax: if they can afford they will pay
[5:04:26] PeterDragon: Thats a good price
[5:04:26] itsKiruki: 25k for just the rack or also full of gpus?
[5:04:27] poop_lol: If they go away they will be worth 50-100k, don't sweat it
[5:04:28] mattress734: If they don't buy fill them with gpus and stack butt
[5:04:28] Jochem0000: if you cant sell it for 25k its probably worth keeping
[5:04:28] here2exist: dad still chilling with X?
[5:04:28] bajbae: if nobody buys them then you profit more off btc later anyway EZ Clap
[5:04:29] yellernanners: 25 super reasonable
[5:04:29] gum1985: he do
[5:04:29] fouzman: they are buying time, time is more money
[5:04:30] wishmaker10: it takes 2 butcoin if you drop it to 20k that means the 1 butcoin is less than 10
[5:04:30] Mthrim: groups can always get the extra 5k from somewhere. price isn't the issue
[5:04:30] ProxyRn_: u are right about its the same price like a normal pc with all the stuff
[5:04:31] moonfairy__: i think people just need a couple days to gather money
[5:04:31] FeudalYak: I mean u want to keep the market up tho
[5:04:32] DisBeans: I mean what are you valuing the crypto at?
[5:04:32] pandutoxi: !pc
[5:04:33] soulxlis: If they dont buy them you can just keep them and sell them when they have money
[5:04:33] Basmage: I mean a shitbox car is 25k so I think its worth
[5:04:34] bobbyloco3: start at 32.5 and then go down to 25 instead of going lower than 25
[5:04:34] chillsley16: it depends if they think they can make their own soon?
[5:04:34] ShotofSalt: 25k prolly good but dropping it wouldnt be bad if they still buy 10s thousands worth of gpus
[5:04:35] orionn99_: I think u have a better chance with smaller groups that grind
[5:04:36] implicit8188: pc price changed cuh
[5:04:37] 7ulul: @Ray__C if man really want something they will find a way to get it
[5:04:39] flightsight23: Everyone bought cars so they're low on money
[5:04:39] Marcobeste97: 25k is honest, especially compared to full pc
[5:04:39] prayge_: Rack is worth more than pc
[5:04:41] redsprite0000: It's not worth selling for lower because each sale you're lowering the value of Buttcoin by helping others pump it into the market
[5:04:41] blackoutguru7: Offer financing and youd sell like crazy
[5:04:42] coolgamer6135: Did the lumber guy get back to you yet or nah
[5:04:43] Snaregods: 25k too much
[5:04:44] VADICKUS007: 25k is a price of the bench. not that much
[5:04:44] 3lonpich: sell racks full of GPUs

[15:13:06] afterlyfa: Nah 100 sounds nice
[15:13:10] cbjester: For realisms sake, each pallet of money should've just had a $20 and a $10 taped to it.
[15:13:10] sid9002: Something must be coming
[15:13:11] theoutcastboi: 200?
[15:13:12] StargateSGU: That pallet should be 1k per pellet

[15:13:48] MaNi_108_: i mean if the gruppe6 guys have better means of protection then ig they would increase the cash
[15:13:53] travellerpad: Sani pays dragon probably has 60k with everything company been buying
