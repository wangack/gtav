The director emailed me about my essay only having one lab now to work in, which  I don't want. The other faculty that I looked at have generally similar but not super overlapping with my research interests. They would extend me an in person interview if I continue through and rotate with others, should I go through with it?

[2:37:26] Mr_Feyshade: Apologies work great at deflecting tickets
[2:37:26] goluu: They usually stall a lot and stuff too for people to have a chance to RP
[2:37:29] DarthRadonis: Was that when your license was expired?
[2:37:43] OwlOfAvery: That's definitely true, but I think it's also because of the lack of police characters right now. They need all hands on high-priority calls
[2:37:54] FelysLefaye: what a time to run into cornwood
[2:38:09] Ketel_One: What type of crime will get you fired as a Dr.? Fellony?

[2:39:26] AleisterPheles: we'll fix it in post
[2:39:34] 1st_rank: I think they have to balance that way because RP can take mechanics anywhere

[2:39:40] Roe_the_Second: How hard was it to get into the server ik its mostly streamers and what not
