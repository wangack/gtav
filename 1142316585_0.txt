[0:29:38] KingPresiden: @lethal19sniper, meowfi1Sip the calendar was largely established by Caesar after seeing the Egyptian calendar. The Romans had a system where the pontifex maximus (him) would choose to add a number of days to the calendar, but because he was so busy leading a civil war the calendar had gotten fucked. So he made one that would mostly govern itself
