[4:09:24] globbobbbbbb: LUL
[4:09:27] 3spada_Grande: Other than serial killers I don't think Barry can investigate much with siz usually knowing so much
[4:09:28] h4x0z: Cause if you play only on Cop side then you're missing out on the meth stuff and other things
[4:09:30] ShadesAreGolden: I wish barry's health would cap at 50 uhnKek
[4:09:30] Luroloro: can imagine the vitriol if Barry finds lab 2

[4:09:48] h4x0z: Well you're right
[4:09:48] sleep_deprived_platypus: @JunJun1510 I think so. He's referred to Saab as his cousin when on Baas in the past I thinkn
[4:09:48] bebo_bobo: maybe Barry would be skinny
[4:09:50] JazzSociety: 🎃 😳

[4:10:16] Doctorofblank: The cousin is just to refer to your separate character. That's all
[4:10:17] SimplyJunJun: Barry goes dirty and helps out cousin Jiz lol
[4:10:17] KingPresiden: @stormcanon huh?
[4:10:17] bebo_bobo: @420thMagicMan well he's Siz's cousin so you do the math
[4:10:18] VirtualKissland: @420thmagicman Barry is siz's cousin
[4:10:19] AmusingNotFunny: @sleep_deprived_platypus everyone says cousin, as a way to talk about other characters tho
[4:10:20] StormCannonToGo: no eatin in lab
