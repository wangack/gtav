[0:18:16] bahartin: did you see ronaldos reaction after the crowd chanted messi at him
[0:18:18] bahartin: it was pretty funny
[0:19:07] swankytiger942221: I mean honestly streaming is easier on some ppl than other. Others get tired after 4 or 5 hours. It's just the way it is
[0:19:38] swankytiger942221: Some ppl can stream for 10+ hours a day and not get tired
[0:20:26] Fishnet83: Hassan being clipped out of context huh. WHAT no way

[1:58:14] Metric: A lot of people buy sm9bs and don't have preamps
[1:58:16] jambag00: you need a phantom power mic
[1:58:23] Metric: or something like a cloudlifter
[1:58:28] fknrando: analog is fun
[1:58:30] bybuckets: Precondensed?
[1:58:38] amazinghorze: is she a streamer too?
[1:58:48] EnticingKey: What's up playas
[1:58:49] brutalmoineau: goxlr do have a preamp I think
[1:58:54] EnticingKey: nidasAha
[1:59:02] timbres: @amazinghorze Its pokimane
[1:59:10] Metric: there are two types of mic, condenser mics and dynamics
[1:59:26] NemisizZ: i wouldnt get a goxlr at this point, its a product thats no longer supported or maintained
[1:59:32] bybuckets: Ahh I think you're combining 2 things, condenser mics need a 48v pre
[2:00:28] StreamElements: Like the content? We all lurk sometimes and forget to follow the channels we love to watch. Don't do that. Follow the channel.

[2:02:07] hadrian76: true shit
[2:02:23] timbres: What happened to the promise you made on Friday that you'd be playing 5 hours of Balatro today
[2:02:29] ObamaBinDroning: i hated that mic
[2:02:35] gostonko: the blue yetis are sooo ugly too
[2:02:38] NemisizZ: they are not as bad as many wants to make them out to be, what it ends out in is people not setting them up correct
[2:02:40] Metric: the bigger meme is that Blue actually make some good mics it's just the Yeti is a meme.
[2:02:42] orange51611: Has anyone tried the AudioTechnica M50xSTS with the little mic
[2:02:46] orange51611: its actually pretty good
[2:02:54] ObamaBinDroning: Shure and Senheisser make better ones and cheaper
[2:02:59] 0liver1891: i have friends that still have them old yetis
[2:03:21] gostonko: nidas bluetooth era classic
[2:03:28] NemisizZ: ppl often go fullblown audio elites for no particular reason besides chasing brand names
[2:03:30] ObamaBinDroning: classic
[2:03:30] orange51611: they combined it and somehow made it work well (imo)
[2:03:37] brutalmoineau: AT are usually doing good stuff for a decent price
[2:04:04] fknrando: osrs GIGACHAD
[2:04:13] Metric: the problem with the yeti is no one knows how to set it up and use it. It has too many settings for the clueless people who buy them.
[2:04:29] bybuckets: The yeti is basically a stage microphone in a fancy tube
[2:04:30] 0liver1891: and it has 0 shock absorption so you can hear every thing that touches the desk

[2:06:13] NemisizZ: you see the exact same happen with pc hardware
[2:06:18] CanuckDynasty: yea buddha said he just spent $3000 on his Mike and he just went back to his old one because he couldn’t get it to sound good
[2:06:28] StreamElements: Don't forget to resub Ogey https://www.twitch.tv/subs/nidas
[2:07:01] NemisizZ: like most people dont need a sure sm7b or whatever its called, waste of money, get a cheap mic like an at2020
[2:07:09] gostonko: 3k on a mic AINTNOWAY
[2:07:11] bybuckets: Audio quality is also very subjective and the differences are subtle
[2:07:12] orange51611: @NemisizZ you mean with the fiddling?
[2:07:26] FideICastro_: what ever happened to just buying a blue yeti
[2:07:36] gostonko: FideICastro_ go back to cuba, commie!!!
[2:07:40] Metric: not all mics can do all jobs, you can spend a lot of money on a really sick mic that sucks at recording voice and you shouting in RP
[2:07:43] brutalmoineau: I have good headphones and dac but I have a super cheap mic because I barely use it, no point in wasting money in that
[2:07:48] NemisizZ: @orange51611 no i mean with chasing brand names and the top of the line for no reason
[2:07:49] FideICastro_: @gostonko classic
[2:07:58] TheNilknarf: You’re right. That applies to most technology hardware. The higher quality it is, the more settings and setup it has and requires.
[2:08:18] gostonko: brutalmoineau SWOONER it sounded fine on party animals
[2:08:36] nsk_envy: Harry doesn't want to get a new mic, he's afraid he might sound different.
[2:09:02] brutalmoineau: @gostonko because I know how to use eq/compressors
[2:09:08] gostonko: EZ
[2:09:26] TheNilknarf: I don’t think Harry could change the way he sounds if he wanted to.
[2:09:32] NemisizZ: just take someone like PirateSoftware, dude uses a yeti, that he adjusted the eq in obs...
[2:09:42] gostonko: aww
[2:09:51] gostonko: just like your old shaders!
[2:10:26] timbres: Just came across a picture of a giant hog on twitter, about to post in discord

[2:12:46] NemisizZ: @brutalmoineau yeah, my point being that people dont need a 400 dollar mic and a 500 dollar mixer for the audio to sound good, it can be done for 100dollars
[2:12:57] cammypug: KEKW
