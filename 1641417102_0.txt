[0:31:21] Shaggymatt: Quite literally their job LUL
[0:31:23] mrPekken: did you sleep with her?
[0:31:25] RoliFromMars: that's literally what they're supposed to do because it's their responsibility if a person misuses their prescriptions
[0:31:26] souper1: Those questions are a part of talk-therapy, no wonder she just threw pills at you, you basically refused therapy.

[0:31:44] paulpeach_: You sound like the perfect candidate for therapy
[0:31:44] intransitt: Remember Kyle they have to think about if you’re just someone seeking narcotics
[0:31:45] the_skotts: But have you?
[0:31:45] Toolchest1: just need to educate yourself on how airplanes work and you won't be scared :D
[0:31:46] LookAtHippo: it's kind of relevant before they prescribe
[0:31:46] melomaniacjh: they have to ask that
[0:31:47] EnergyCrow: @el_presidente072 WICKED / moon2L

[0:32:02] el_presidente072: @EnergyCrow OOOO What's up bud
[0:32:07] theoldmiltbagger: @Kyle a lot of times it's about the medication because some can make different problems worse. It's super weird but they all kinda do it.
[0:32:07] IrishSausage: One of the side affects of anxiety meds is suicidal tendencies. So if you already have that they goota be careful
[0:32:09] jhonner1223: they need to be able to say why they want to sell you the most expensive stuff
[0:32:10] Rellies: i hate feeling like im dependent on medicine so i know what you mean Kyle
[0:32:10] Squints2Pee: probably thought you were lying to get pills
[0:32:10] kingthundah: me too
[0:32:10] Warhood: A lot of it has to do with gauging like side effects and if you are at risk
[0:32:12] Athrun_Zala7: you see the new Avatar trailer?
[0:32:14] highflight2k2: So I guess you wouldn't be interesting in flying in my single engine airplane then?
[0:32:14] Frakkles: It's about fixing what causes it
[0:32:15] filipe_vasconcellos_: Probe this wideAmogus Lady
[0:32:15] FlGJAM: your body is made up of chemicals
[0:32:15] TheGingerSammy: A lot of medications can increase those thoughts so they have to be aware to monitor risk
[0:32:17] EskimoBrather: so did you get the drugs in the end? KEKW @Kyle
[0:32:22] middy_92: some things they do have to ask. it's like doctors usually do the suicide question.
[0:32:22] bseebs: I didn’t either, but man it’s helped me so much.
[0:32:24] Sungare: They have to make sure you get the right medication or it could fuck with your head hella
[0:32:25] IM_GOING_GOBLIN_MODE: yeah but any drug addict could come and say its for airplanes etc
[0:32:25] mustardjello: she doesn't know you so asking questions is a good thing
[0:32:27] Daaraath: She probably just tried to find out if your fear of flying comes from something in your past or so
[0:32:27] IM_GOING_GOBLIN_MODE: they need to make sure
[0:32:28] kaceynlove: Relatable

[0:33:12] Mendiiiii: i took a xanex once, and i drank a beer without realizing and i blacked out
[0:33:13] ChrisInDC: Yeah they want to know the kind of person you are/history before dealing with the problem.
[0:33:16] Code_J92: @Kyle at least you didn't go the John Mulaney route to get the zanies LUL
[0:33:16] bseebs: I took 4 different meds before it actually was something that worked.
[0:33:16] Laidback_Paul: xanax is strong af

[0:34:15] sigaty: I’m surprised they gave you Xanax… there’s others meds
[0:34:17] AlistairWMowbray: If you have ever seen those Flight Crash Investigation shows how could you not be afraid of flying
[0:34:17] Optimus_Mega: Tell it all to Twitch Chat. So what about your Home Life Hmmm
[0:34:21] Alkisen91: turn your webcam on and flex ur gym gains
[0:34:26] Eanee: hello
[0:34:27] manlyhandles: moon2HUH good to do your own research
[0:34:27] kingthundah: not every psychologist is the same
[0:34:28] Klobbix: Does driving in someone elses car bother you though
[0:34:32] juanmanualdriver: in control
[0:34:32] Brattmadley: private planes easy
[0:34:32] TheRealFolkBlues___: kPLANES
[0:34:33] Frakkles: HUH

[0:34:35] Maccy_Fergo: Maccy_Fergo subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! 
[0:34:38] SauceIRL: gues you just gotta be pilot now
[0:34:39] nezets_: Just become a pilot :)
[0:34:39] KennedyFnPowers: pentawHmm
[0:34:39] Droid_Sensei: your a control freak
[0:34:40] Laidback_Paul: maybe its the fact that you cant leave the plane once it goes in air
[0:34:42] SiemonSaid: are you fine being in a car with someone else driving? or a bus?
[0:34:43] bronn_7: so get a job as a pilot?
[0:34:44] transientWitch: thats anxiety ...
[0:34:48] RealJoseSuicidio: monkaFly 󠀀
[0:34:48] morningdoo: become a pilot PogChamp
[0:34:52] Rellies: totally valid
[0:34:53] kinet007: and then you wonder why the therapist asked so many questions
[0:34:53] MrGunner95: that's anxiety
[0:34:54] TheRealFolkBlues___: time to become an actual pilot, Kyle
[0:34:54] Bloodshot91: just fly the plane then 4Head Kappa
[0:34:55] beerbo64: do you get that same feeling riding passenger in a car?
[0:35:00] ike44: so kyle pred is basically not rp KEKW
[0:35:00] Isundir: so fixing control issues do not revolve around talking about planes
[0:35:02] souper1: @kingthundah Psychologists don't prescribe meds, for starters.
[0:35:02] KingMcNastyy: @Kyle are you okay with other people driving you?
[0:35:02] JennaRad: prolly all in small cessnas too
[0:35:03] vitamin_bee: @kingthundah big pharma trying to cover up the psychologist clone operations
[0:35:03] Cosmic_Waves: we need complete control
[0:35:05] Rellies: true
[0:35:05] tanroy91: That is definitely a control thing. I had the exact same thing the last few years. It is an irrational fear but it really sucks in the moment
[0:35:06] basedsilly: NODDERS
[0:35:07] CARRYWURST__: NODDERS
[0:35:07] ViktorKiloTango: yeah, i love flight sims but planes are just sums of non flying parts, so that always gets in my head and I hate flying
[0:35:07] Astrodie: LUL
[0:35:09] Geedka_: i feel that exact same way especially when i went from LA to Australia was a rough 14 hrs
[0:35:10] SauceIRL: yeah. statistically its nothing to worry about but you still worry
[0:35:11] AztecKniight: I just get scared I'll puke while in the plane, even if I don
[0:35:11] perplexedparr0t: And you wonder why your therapist asked you i your homelife is good KEKW
[0:35:12] LaFleur_13: is this "control" thing present when someone else is driving a car for example, Kyle?
[0:35:13] EnergyCrow: Hmm
[0:35:17] transientWitch: Planes don't crash because of turbulence
[0:35:19] Th3L4stEmper0r: Swimming in the open Ocean scares the fuck outta me, I always think Jaws or a giant squid is gonna eat me
[0:35:20] brick_frog_: which is ironic because u would def crash if u were to fly a plane @Kyle
[0:35:24] Mulnerd: @kyle I'm scared of flying too but I just think hey at least it's a quick way to go if it goes wrong
[0:35:27] gunklobster: sorta like a phobia of kinds...
[0:35:28] Deetea86: OceanMan
[0:35:29] Arcahan: okay now I'm also afraid of driving LUL
[0:35:31] Meisterfolsom: go on a plane with a parachute
[0:35:32] Liucilijus: I just accept that I might die every time I go on a plane LUL
[0:35:32] Pur3bl00d_: 100% lose with a airplane accident lmao
[0:35:32] Morothemic: I just let go. I decided there was literally nothing I can do so I just enjoy it. I fucking zonk out now everytime
[0:35:32] FlGJAM: I put my trust in statistics, and mechanical engineering, and the pilots.
[0:35:35] TheCatzM3ow: NOOO
[0:35:36] Optimus_Mega: Stop learning from TikTok KEKW
[0:35:36] Albert_Fn_Wesker: the fact kobe was one of those ppl in 2020...wild
[0:35:37] Deetea86: BorisJam
[0:35:38] KingTheTurtle: I just put my faith in all the engineering and math gone into flight...Mathematicians haven't actually solved the formula for flight btw KEKW
[0:35:38] grimblymcgoo: The first 5 min of the flight are the most dangerous. Planes WANT to fly and they generally automatically land with a couple of button pushes
[0:35:40] johnniep: take pilot cert irl KEKLEO
[0:35:40] MrGunner95: are you nervous as a passenger of a car?
[0:35:42] Astrodie: just go tandem skydiving then you wont care about anything LUL
[0:35:43] oneoldbob: better not cross the street
[0:35:43] shiraihellfyre: that just means theres more chance I COULD be the next one
[0:35:44] tlv2020: Play Flight Simulator with Nick and Malena.  Could help.
[0:35:45] ViktorKiloTango: lol yeah just use your carryon as a parachute xD
[0:35:46] Isundir: do you always want to drive the car?
[0:35:47] TheGingerSammy: So you’re saying there is a chance kyleisS
[0:35:49] bronn_7: I'm guessing you don't watch Air Crash Investigation? love that show
[0:35:49] lorryy: Being in a single engine is just always going to be in the back of your head that if that 1 engine dies...
[0:35:50] haribohunter30: hey kyle, whats good
[0:35:50] pinkcandytroll: Facts and feelings are handeled by different part of the brain, it's a  common feeling.
[0:35:51] ineedtopooprightnow: Kyle maybe it’s not the flying you’re scared of but the take off
[0:35:52] Headss: Now compare them to car accidents
[0:35:56] Slesh5: yeah tell that to those 238 ppl
[0:35:57] henege: i have the same with laser eye surgery. the thought of going blind makes it scary
[0:35:58] fFaArRmMeErR: you are 100x more likely to die in a car then a plane/helicopter
[0:35:58] OptimusJon: Is the PD weapon price and stuff changing after the weapon changes in crims?  @Kyle
[0:36:00] l3lackmoses: once you except death it'll be fine :)
[0:36:00] joekahama: did you know 238 people out of 10 million who played GTA5 died last year
[0:36:00] TheRealFolkBlues___: "what if I become one of the next 238 people to die on a plane?" kyleisS
[0:36:01] NotNullable: yeah dont look up car crash statistics
[0:36:02] DazedGeniee: private jet/Heli?
[0:36:05] PAID_ACTOR1: being very controlling goes hand in hand with anxiety
[0:36:06] Axylth: that would be content
[0:36:07] JennaRad: but those small planes are the most dangerous ones LOL
[0:36:07] freebird1776: a lot of those deaths are most likely small engine planes
[0:36:08] Feic_: @tlv2020 Yes. Playing a game would help...
[0:36:08] gaellmoon: You gotta shop around for a new therapist, if u wanna deal with that
[0:36:11] densvam: pilots of commercial jets are so well trained im fully relaxed when on a plane, if shit happens fuck it I guess
[0:36:12] Fightn_words: fly to the land of Manga and anime
[0:36:12] DerbyDan: a couple of intro flights
[0:36:13] KennedyFnPowers: I have a pilots license irl :)
[0:36:13] campnowhere: luxury train rides KEKLEO
[0:36:14] EnergyCrow: Pog then you could stream flight sim and get a setup goin
[0:36:15] kingthundah: @souper1 yeah ik, but finding the right one is hard
[0:36:17] ULTIMVTUM: Flights fuck with me too. To me, it's the fact that you can survive car crashes. If a plane drops out of the sky, you're basically done.
[0:36:19] asisasis3: carmine is pilot irl @Kyle
[0:36:25] highflight2k2: Cell signals don't work below 3000 feet.
[0:36:31] ChrisInDC: And cats are on the ground

[0:36:39] Hourman: your brain is basically like "fucking planes, how do they work??"
[0:36:41] blaydes4486: I'll fly you around in a helicohelicopter
[0:36:41] TheCatzM3ow: NOOO
[0:36:41] NotNullable: Baltimore monkaW
[0:36:43] joekahama: i wouldn't feel safe either
[0:36:47] Isundir: so what about a taxi?
[0:36:47] Rellies: Greyhound?
[0:36:49] zchron1c: yikes
[0:36:49] JennaRad: thats bc the lightrail is dangerous in Baltimore lol
[0:36:51] FlGJAM: I don't like riding in a car, because I'm not in control and people drive like maniacs
[0:36:51] ChrisInDC: Bmore moonCheers
[0:36:52] Rellies: same with Pittsburgh, thats why
[0:36:53] mrPekken: bus trips sucks
[0:36:55] Headss: Just say it was the poors
[0:36:56] tlv2020: @tlv2020 It’s pretty realistic.  Learning more about the plane and process could help.
[0:36:56] JasmineWynn: one time i took a Greyhound and it actually got in an accident, it was crazy
[0:36:58] DazedGeniee: in a plane crash you're definitely dead, but car crashes don't lead to death most of the time
[0:36:59] beerbo64: so getting a license could fix your issue it sounds like
[0:37:01] Domre: My neighbor growing up was a flight instructor. Every year for my birthday from 12-18, he gave me flying lessons as a gift
[0:37:01] TheGladiator2212: you're scared of a train that goes choo choo KEKW
[0:37:02] KingTheTurtle: same lol I love having a personal driver
