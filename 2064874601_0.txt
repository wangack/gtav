[2:22:03] Divadeus: Does Benji know how to blood bend? Bloodbending is a specialized sub-skill and a rare variant of waterbending that allows an extremely advanced waterbender to take hold of and manipulate fluids within an organism's body, allowing the bender to move the person's muscles. This technique is referred to as the highest level of waterbending, as well as the darkest, most powerful, and most feared of all bending techniques, and it is the only art known to endanger the user's mental state.

[6:13:32] endiiiio7: In a display of financial prowess, Benji managed to sink -10k into what some might call a "questionable investment." üí∏ Meanwhile, a "friendly visit" to Ott's box resulted in some intriguing acquisitions. üéÅ Stirring the pot further, Benji inadvertently nudged Dundee towards a showdown with Hydra. ‚öîÔ∏è And amidst the chaos, our GPU production remained at a stagnant zero. üôÉ Stay tuned for more of Benji's bold decisions and the ever-elusive quest for success!
