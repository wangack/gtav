[0:59:50] VADICKUS007: + atms %
[0:59:51] theoil345: well it’s a Bank lol
[0:59:51] zangdahrr: all of this shit could have just be avoided just by 1 phonecall and both groups would be triving
[0:59:52] argonize: yup
[0:59:55] HoronXI: probably will get nerf like grime later
[0:59:55] eliteman56: They've been nerfed I think
[0:59:57] lunate87: + atm %
[0:59:57] Skiplinee: They need to balance it
[0:59:57] dan0py: so unbalanced
[0:59:57] MrTribal: 5k an hour
[0:59:59] 2emedy: I think they're about to get got pretty soon. The devs are fattening them up.
[1:00:02] lordcooterkilla: it has a cool down
[1:00:03] sunchipsz: the majority of g6 workers aren't even being robbed
[1:00:04] fredihwjr: for sure it will become a risk job with the robery contracts
[1:00:12] mihirantha: Surely it nerf soon
[1:00:13] broxx1: @zprosilent RIPBOZO KEKW
[1:00:14] VADICKUS007: 5k/hr. is crazy
[1:00:17] CyanMig: theyre getting ID cards and weapon licenses, theyre gonna be part of the heist system
[1:00:18] theoil345: 24 hours someone made 120k
[1:00:18] couteez: oi
[1:00:20] PersonalNemesis: G6 ruining the economy and not even worth robbing
[1:00:27] qvbxx: maybe to encourage more ppl to do it for the later heists
[1:00:27] Cebolexx1: Probably in the future the robberies will need group 6 and if they don't pay well no one will do the job
[1:00:30] arteries_: g6 might be the most nuanced job
[1:00:35] ohraidr: the amount u have to spend on g6 is crazy tho so it evens it out
[1:00:35] halfstepmadness: After other group see cyprus weed sale other group will not settle there
[1:00:37] argonize: ye g6 pays the most rn
[1:00:37] couteez: wolfaHands
[1:00:44] DrKamaKazii: you make the same as doctors
[1:00:51] nosebeersx: g6 is dogshit rp tho
[1:00:58] Louwh1sky: im wondering if u can go higher than a hundred% like gold stars
[1:00:59] gaabaage: Snr bunz has to be lowest to avoid afk andies
[1:01:00] rpaddictor: you can make 5k a hour on average, however every 3 hours  if you have big truck you can do a job that pays 2.4k one time
[1:01:01] quote_me_if_horsen: oh the sells are on the map
[1:01:02] DarkLight917: WHen g6 workers can protect themselves, i see them getting robbed alot more and much more hazardous of a job, Im sure the fence will pay more.
[1:01:07] TropicalToucan: @DrKamaKazii I think doctors make 500 an hour now LULW
[1:01:10] Bournsinner: I assume they were designed to get robbed often. they may get paid well for the risk
[1:01:12] DangersClose: @PersonalNemesis Yeah devs kind of fumbled how cool bank truck robberies could of been, who knows maybe it will be a proper thing later on.
[1:01:13] dan0py: I hear the Cumbria’s in the background lol
[1:01:21] dan0py: Cumbia
[1:01:27] MadVylan: I wonder how much the 30 butc contract will increase the hourly
[1:01:32] Louwh1sky: i meant to say wondering if u can go higher than 100%
[1:01:47] Koltary: @MadVylan no clue but im really worried about the snitching part

[1:02:20] mottarro: has the npc sold anything?
[1:02:27] eliteman56: I think they shouldn't nerf the money, instead buff the bags and pallets for crime stuff. That way they get robbed more to balance shit out
[1:02:28] fauxRothko: ApuChaCha
[1:02:33] TropicalToucan: @mottarro hasnt hired one because the war
[1:02:38] dstopian: monkaHmm
[1:02:46] theoil345: your out selling them
[1:02:47] TropicalToucan: I wonder if its you selling or its like rep decay
[1:02:49] gaabaage: Mby due to not selling ?
[1:02:49] shadowreaper199876: HeyGuys
[1:02:50] Xernique: maybe cuz you're at 100 and keep selling
[1:02:51] observer__ward: Could be they not selling based on time
[1:02:51] Louwh1sky: oh i see it has a cap
[1:02:53] negapanda12: maybe because they aren’t selling.
[1:02:54] CUSTOMS35: i want scooby dooby man
[1:02:54] ChrisPNutssss: youre contesting the same turf
[1:02:59] HoronXI: probably strain on turf
[1:03:03] Shunne93: It just shows all of em, but prob affects only the ones in the same turf
[1:03:04] nphect_: thats all the weed starins that exist probably?
[1:03:11] Hoxter: would it just be presence on the street?
[1:03:12] Hades_bz: could be scooby do 100% is goin up, so the % of zaza in going down in comparison
[1:03:12] rrr333: it's because the amount you are selling is growing, they are 56% of your amount
[1:03:13] virol0ne: Oooh I get what you saying
[1:03:13] MrTribal: maybe you can only see in the same turf?
[1:03:14] TropicalToucan: Its interesting you can see every strain not even ones pushed onyour turf
[1:03:17] theoil345: they haven’t grow yet
[1:03:20] CyanMig: its either turf specific or taking all turfs in aggregate
[1:03:27] Koltary: maybe cause only those two are on the same turf
[1:03:32] Xernique: no way no
[1:03:38] quassaarr: maybe is for whole city
[1:03:38] Amine_MLC: yeah obviously
[1:03:38] shamma656: i think those are strains in the city and their rep in city
[1:03:41] Foxxera_tv: tbh 56 % for them , without pushing thats admirable
[1:03:45] RabCrangoon: Sam Gaas OMEGALUL
[1:03:48] quassaarr: who sells most in city
[1:03:53] Louwh1sky: mmm it might be scuff but idk
[1:03:58] say0nara69: and 2 of them are company KEKW
[1:03:59] eliteman56: someone has 2 turfs?
[1:03:59] SoloManQ8: EZ JUST OWNERS HAVE REP
[1:04:00] MrTribal: no i mean you can only see the percentage each strain if its in the same turf
[1:04:01] Koltary: yea it shows everything overall but only those two are on the same turf because you know they are
[1:04:02] HoronXI: yeah dev will probably fix it next tsunami
[1:04:10] TropicalToucan: Speedy #1 Seller in city EZ
[1:04:11] MadVylan: yeah but this is the first time coin is directly related to monetary value. The research is important to calibrate the butcoin selling prices, and the number of coins to budget

[1:04:32] dan0py: leaked LUL
[1:04:34] negapanda12: didn’t you sell vagos weed on your block?
[1:04:35] rrr333: maybe they want a leaderboard for weed
[1:04:37] djerbis: yep, or maybe they still  drying it
[1:04:37] FrederichSwart: Perhaps when your strain isn't being sold, the boss see you're slacking so your strain goes down.
[1:04:40] SoloManQ8: ALREADY EXPOSED NOW
[1:04:48] difficultsleep3r: Did the company buy two turfs?
[1:05:00] 3lonpich: DOes the amount of weed you sell affect your competiton Reputation?

[4:11:45] TastyKudzu: I do think this war demonstrates what will be a big issue in 4.0: They want to have clean civs control businesses and stuff but the PD can't protect civs so they must turn to crime to protect themselves. Like a lot of those sani runners weren't crims at all before and now are doing illegal shit cause cops can't protect them.

[5:30:11] frailgolem: They can allow player house robberies if consequences are on par. Like if they catch you, it's 1000 months.  High risk high reward
[5:30:12] Xernique: war of attrition

[5:32:41] Mundosaysyourfired: @frailgolem house robberies failed or successful can be a bigger problem for the house owner than the robber. How do police make sure a robber isn't in the house anymore? they have to clear it. So if they clear it and see weed racks like in Lang's house. What happens?
