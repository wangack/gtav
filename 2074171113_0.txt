[1:19:19] zrussell93: You have any opinions on the police commissioner legislation?
[1:20:26] RoosterXXIII: appointed by the mayor
[1:21:09] zrussell93: From what I understand the mayor will appoint a Snr Officer (or higher) and then thats where the mayors power is "supposed" to end
[1:21:25] drewkillsu: I'm fairly certain the power of 8 or whatever is already approved that they just got to be appointed now I could be wrong

[1:33:41] udukhai: we call them Altaholics
[1:33:42] zrussell93: I think the worry about hiring experienced people is the worry that its going to be the same PD. Not saying I agree with it but I think that may be the worry

[1:36:10] Galacticowboy: @alvin___kamara where, elaborate
[1:36:20] Lepaca: @Galacticowboy which streamer are you parroting? she's on patrol almost every weekday
[1:36:30] Civrock: The TV does that on its own.
[1:36:41] Civrock: Screensaver, pixel shift, etc.
[1:36:43] stodd_: my misso is learning slowly to not leave a still image on the oled lol
[1:36:55] Galacticowboy: @Lepaca I'm not parroting anyone I haven't seen her since k's raid
[1:36:56] Civrock: So it doesn't do it while you're actively using it.
[1:36:56] taylomic: People always ask me "who's the best GTA roleplayer?" I always say "Timmac"
[1:37:14] Civrock: Just additional measures to avoid potential burn-in.
[1:37:19] dkota41: @Galacticowboy just because she's not around when K's around doesn't mean she isn't
[1:37:20] Civrock: Pixel shift you don't even notice.

[1:38:21] USMCSapper: Everything wrong with the pd begins and ends with the leadership, every DAP issued is a failure of the leadership (ie. The Captains) to properly train and lead those beneath them.

[1:40:32] drewkillsu: That right there say it louder for everyone in the back
[1:40:42] Simonrpfan: its like punishing those who are working more.
[1:41:51] Lepaca: FAFO
[1:42:01] Simonrpfan: Everyone is human, there will be mistakes made sometimes at the end of a 8-10 hour streaming shift.
[1:42:24] Morvicious: i think if you have a system (DAPS) that leads to handicapping people to be afraid of doing the job.It's a failed system. obviously need a little more balanced system
[1:42:26] Galacticowboy: or like someone getting a felony for stabbing a local
[1:43:26] RisKkeyy: Should be a review to remove them just like it is to add them

[1:44:42] drewkillsu: Esfand was on and said even If they remove his suspension today that he may request a longer time off he is enjoying actually being able to police without policing lol
[1:44:56] jaggedbowl420: the higher ups treat this too much like real life, at the end of the day it‚Äôs a fucking game
[1:44:56] StreamElements: The thing is, you're like a brother to me, but at the end of the day, when it's all said and done, business is business, and not for nothing, it is what it is and that's that.
[1:44:56] krustymcdoogle: I think playing cop after the mayor starts getting more involved will become  will be more relaxed
[1:44:57] GETAFlX: carmine though - he should be a cop
[1:45:09] Splitcookie713: Maybe instead of getting fired, you get demoted and forced back to ppo or non solo cadet. Can lead to different rp
[1:45:23] RisKkeyy: Cornwood is great but he did take it too far often
[1:45:31] Galacticowboy: @kayc_luv Commish Carmine and K and Ramee for civ oversight LUL
[1:45:34] Morvicious: There's also no oversight on the captains either. that causes problems too!

[1:49:03] Galacticowboy: there was absolutely doubt and the doj also dropped the ball
[1:49:26] Lepaca: K would still be arrested, he'd just have more cellmates if the cops handled it properly
[1:49:27] slymox: DoJ is hesitant to set any kind of precedent it seems
[1:49:52] Splitcookie713: The boys should have prepared somewhat at least
[1:50:06] BozzyGG: Everyone make mistakes, and alot of the times it is to make good RP from it, but fire good cops is a bit extreme
[1:50:12] Galacticowboy: @slymox they set the precedent that anyone can plant a gun and get away with fucking someone
[1:50:16] jaggedbowl420: if that‚Äôs the case Murphy should remain guilty as well
[1:50:22] RisKkeyy: Exactly, why take the soak if there's no sway from letter of the law
[1:50:23] CROSA71: oh I‚Äôm looking forward to see where today gets taken with the RP

[1:50:38] snorrow92: @Galacticowboy not anymore with DNA being added now
[1:50:42] GETAFlX: the only reason it went to bench was because K and club thought it was a cop fuckup.. but they lost anyway .. which was kinda odd
[1:50:42] RisKkeyy: The appeal*
[1:50:57] wytechocolate650: nope
[1:50:58] Simonrpfan: no. no one testified
[1:50:58] g33j4y: no
[1:51:01] Galacticowboy: no one saw him
[1:51:04] g33j4y: only got told
[1:51:05] RisKkeyy: The witness didn't show up
[1:51:10] jaggedbowl420: nope
[1:51:12] hoostiner: svenson said he did but withdrew it
[1:51:19] jaggedbowl420: heresay
[1:51:23] BozzyGG: No he never hold the gun
[1:51:24] Galacticowboy: @snorrow92 only ppl with a violent felony have dna on record
[1:51:26] Splitcookie713: I think it‚Äôs best for cops to follow the letter of the law and judges make interpretations of the law
[1:51:30] hoostiner: then didn't show up. bench trial
[1:51:32] USMCSapper: The said there was a 911 that stated k had a gun on him
[1:51:35] hoostiner: warrant
[1:51:35] Ecex93: cop testified that they stopped barry on a bike, and didnt follow protocol from there KEKW
[1:52:02] snorrow92: @Galacticowboy you can still try to match DNA found on the planted gun to the one that has it on him. if the dna doesnt match it more likely a planted gun
[1:52:25] sfbuckmaster69: my thing was u had judge Murphy overturn his case when he was gsr positive & found with pd gun. but because he was a judge they overturned it for him. but k was gsr neg claimed same allegations with a lot more of a case and he is found guilty? where does that make sense?
[1:52:31] Galacticowboy: @snorrow92 the moment it's planted it has his dna
[1:52:50] Lordbidwell: wtf paragraph chat
[1:53:01] snorrow92: @Galacticowboy doesnt it show dna of multiple people when pd scan it?
[1:53:12] Splitcookie713: I think Slacks did a good job initially but then the next day the warrant was pushed
[1:53:18] jaggedbowl420: @sfbuckmaster69 exactly, the double standard for how they treat government employees is crazy
[1:53:27] g33j4y: i dont think the case mattered tbh the council rejecting his real estate was the turning point
[1:53:43] hoostiner: absolutely @timmac i loved k's speech afterwards though. great stuff
[1:53:44] krustymcdoogle: I think everyone is aware is just trying to fix things through rp which takes a bit longer

[1:54:31] Galacticowboy: clear bias
[1:54:44] GETAFlX: remember though 4.0 was not a wipe. it was a 5 year gap. so people can remember things
[1:54:49] jaggedbowl420: it don‚Äôt look good for the server when everyone is supposed to have a fresh start, yet the cops still treat people like murderers
[1:55:04] Lordbidwell: Like you said they turned Mr K into the old him and unleashed demon mode , they messed around and found out timmacSHRUG

[1:59:24] Splitcookie713: Would be cool to see K sue civilly but won‚Äôt happen

[1:59:33] hoostiner: he was running for another warrant

[1:59:59] Ecex93: It's cool they are forced to argue in court, but the laws need adjustments quick
[2:00:23] Pazz: yeah it started as a violent felony was going to ruin the jobs but has now changed to all felonies
[2:00:24] 27quetzii: he has 2 votes yes
[2:00:25] slymox: Dab is pardoning under the notion that they should have set the precedent fir planted guns

[2:02:31] drewkillsu: Yeah knight has quite a bit sbs and I don't watch rhodes
[2:02:38] Ecex93: @drewkillsu the new cops thing was so cops wouldn't remember the crim pasts, but apparently it didnt follow suit for everyone
[2:02:48] NoGodNoPleaseNo: @simonrpfan oof, that scuba scuff was rough
[2:02:51] krustymcdoogle: but saab and snow along with timmac had to make new ones
[2:03:04] djdargie420: Yup that him

[2:03:14] Galacticowboy: thought glorion was the fat one
[2:03:20] DJSquashy: doesnt help that some of them sound the same
[2:03:24] djdargie420: Bajon is the big guy
[2:03:32] Splitcookie713: Zolo was so locked in. the scuba tank should have been last resort

[2:37:38] BozzyGG: Thats so wierd ngl

[3:24:40] SpaderELITE: Yeah, I bought my house in Washington for 195,500. Lived in it for 3 years. Sold it for 325k bought a house with 13ac in Michigan for 95,600. My house is now worth 176,400. SeemsGood
[3:24:41] s_bell: that‚Äôs crazy expensive
[3:24:50] Kkaedal: like 9% of American adults says they have some type medical debt
[3:24:50] karly_ann00: Ubers are way cheaper than ambulances lol
[3:24:53] sychotixx: Actually, ambulances aren't usually tied to hospitals or the government. John Oliver did a great video about them
[3:25:04] karly_ann00: if I break my leg I‚Äôm taking an Uber
[3:25:17] Pazz: $32k for a 13 block ambulance ride.. the accident was in the same road just down about 2 miles
[3:25:23] s_bell: hey I‚Äôll drive myself to the hospital
[3:25:26] Kkaedal: @SpaderELITE Good stuff but don't you get fucked by capital gains tax or some shit ?
[3:25:28] ttvsaucefeed: @spaderelite Michigan and Ohio are the two most slept on states when it comes to buying houses for cheap tbh
[3:25:30] sychotixx: Yeah, absolutely should be.
[3:25:44] Viperprime: but I pay $600/m for Medical with VA back up
[3:25:50] MetalicJive: Yeah... ambulance rides are ridiculously expensive
[3:26:00] WhoKnowz21: we pay for it in property tax, no?

[3:26:13] Noomad: @Pazz monkaW
[3:26:15] lister_fiend: it would be awesome if twitch offered health insurance for streamers
[3:26:16] SwampThangRon: ambulances are starting to be done by privately owned medical transportation companies
[3:26:17] ggsz: @kevol33t same
[3:26:19] SpaderELITE: @Kkaedal Yeah, taxes the year I sold my house was not pretty. lolz
[3:26:21] Kkaedal: Also in France, you can know they price or the things you pay before hand or just by asking
[3:26:27] shnazzle: they can be owned by the hospital, the city, or a private entity, and sometimes they can be out of network
[3:26:43] ttvsaucefeed: @lister_fiend lmaoooo you think twitch will offer insurance that‚Äôs funny
[3:26:46] s_bell: hospital food is not bad tho
[3:27:01] s_bell: can‚Äôt complain
[3:27:01] Kkaedal: @SpaderELITE Damn, that's so stupid to get taxed cuz you did good with your money
[3:27:03] lister_fiend: @ttvsaucefeed i didnt say they would i said it would be awesome if they dud
[3:27:14] drewkillsu: @s_bell depends on where you live lmao
[3:27:14] Spagett: Are you still living down here until you get a crowbar lol
[3:27:21] SpaderELITE: @ttvsaucefeed For sure. A lot of nice properties on the cheap.

[3:28:14] Kkaedal: @SpaderELITE The thing about the money getting taxed every step is crazy especially when you don't what they use it for
[3:28:15] Viperprime: LOL don't get started on NMS lol

[5:43:12] Nitrostealth: Saves me shits ton of money
[5:43:18] Lordbidwell: Yes
[5:43:23] DrCached: I consume like 6000 calories a day so food is just a fleeting thing for me, I ate a whole panda express family box in 2 days KEKW
[5:43:33] Galacticowboy: I just can't eat the same thing over and over blech
[5:43:46] Nitrostealth: I mean, I'm single and only spend about $300-$400 a month on groceries
[5:43:51] Lordbidwell: You do but you stay in shape
[5:44:08] Mr_Jhin4: for carbs i do 2 types of potatoes and 2 types of rice and i just diceroll every meal , and i do same with the meat KEKW
[5:44:19] DrCached: I'm on that skinny man runner diet. KEKW
[5:44:27] salinas9944: same brother

[5:44:53] mediocre_pwnage: i eat once a day for about 1k calories and bulletproof coffee twice - under 5 grams of carbs a day
[5:44:57] Digital_Malice: Chili is a great one for 4 or 5 days, can do a lot to it for each meal, can make dip or nachos with it. It's high in protein and fiber.
[5:44:57] mediocre_pwnage: never felt better
[5:44:59] mediocre_pwnage: carbs are bad

[5:52:45] Nitrostealth: @coopdaville peepoCheer
[5:52:49] D4AprilFools: fresn n lean and instacart :D then gas stations for vape kinda suckds
[5:52:52] Nitrostealth: Vape stuff is so fucking expensive
[5:52:52] Erohw666: i just roam around costco and eat samples all day so i don't have to spend money on food.
[5:52:56] GammaGuy20: costco in the uk isnt that much cheaper either even for bulk stuff
[5:52:58] Mithu: yea that is odd
[5:53:00] Digital_Malice: Elementvape
[5:53:00] Nitrostealth: I was thinking of switching to Zyn's

[5:53:18] Nitrostealth: But idk what is worse that for your gums or vaping
[5:53:18] OneOfAKindPanda: waters and drinks so u dont gotta carry everything and they drop it at the door but thats cuz my house has like 20 steps up from the sidework lol
[5:53:24] Digital_Malice: I get it, just takes like a week to get here.

[5:53:28] hellenkeller_sidepiece: you can order alcohol but not vapes is crazy
[5:53:29] MonsieurMiquail: all the vape shops in my area deliver, they have their own drivers
[5:53:31] SpaderELITE: Costco also has some very good cuts of meat in bulk as well. Nice inch and a half ribeye, prime rib cuts are large too.
[5:53:44] BiGGHydro: It's a weird tax issue I bet but they do alcohol so idk
[5:54:00] SpaderELITE: Throw those bad larry's on a smoker. mmhmm.
[5:54:09] Galacticowboy: @OneOfAKindPanda they get docked on the tip
[5:54:57] drshagnastyy: I used it for things like toilet paper, paper towels, dish soap, laundry detergent, garbage bags. Stuff that me and all my roommates used so we were going through it all fast.

[5:58:01] Osean13: yeah he got it from johnson
[5:58:11] mediocre_pwnage: wild part of peanut/aziz is that grinder voice ID peanut when he had mask and different voice
[5:58:23] Jasonam8: Ammunation via johnson

[5:59:15] beemo_plays: https://clips.twitch.tv/ArtisticArtsyRadishCoolStoryBro--YP6vBWv1wRHnOFR
[5:59:22] Jasonam8: @mediocre_pwnage peanut did rob him before so the mechanic at least had a reason to be skeptical
[5:59:43] mediocre_pwnage: @Jasonam8  it's one thing to be skeptical, it's another to positively ID someone based solely on voice

[6:01:00] Jasonam8: Part of it was cornwood specifically asked if it was peanut. That's why I don't know if peanut was a legit suspect from before. I have a feeling peanut gave his real name to that mechanic in the previous theft. Not sure though.
[6:01:15] Lordbidwell: Yeah already posted
[6:01:39] VexedVarianT: his laugh is so contagious tho lmao
[6:01:45] Galacticowboy: YEYE
[6:01:46] BucFanJKE: Love his laugh tho
[6:01:47] Jasonam8: His laugh is awesome
[6:02:06] mediocre_pwnage: @Jasonam8  he asked if it was peanut because the mechanic said it the first time to another cop
[6:02:11] drshagnastyy: You can tell he is experiencing pure joy playing Tuggz though, i love it.
[6:02:47] Jasonam8: @mediocre_pwnage gotcha and I think I understand that by the rules he can't assume this new guy is also peanut
[6:03:15] BloodTiger_: I miss Hutch playing Bustin, shit was gold lol
[6:03:18] mediocre_pwnage: @Jasonam8  you can say you think it might be, but not 100% certain that it's him unless you have proof

[9:44:44] Kkaedal: 41-46 range
[9:44:51] Sweetest_Ex: is a rolled bill equal to a single dollar or
[9:44:57] Kkaedal: 40-47-

[9:45:13] Torrok: fat_dabber no
[9:45:26] Azzarill: for cash
[9:45:29] Sweetest_Ex: i would assume the higher quality your stuff is the better pay per bottle right?
[9:45:59] WikiDic: yep high proof avg qual is about 135ish
[9:46:03] Azzarill: just to see the spread ?
[9:46:06] BozzyGG: @azzarill the recept are unique per player, so they dont have the same
[9:46:40] WikiDic: @Azzarill everyones recipe is different
[9:46:41] TheKhanGreen: @wikidic I thought max was 130
[9:46:46] Kkaedal: But there is a difference within the same quality, like average the top is around 130 from what tuggz say but can go down to 100 I think
[9:46:49] WikiDic: at what will produce the best when they make it
[9:47:15] Azzarill: @WikiDic i get that the cash spread should be about the same no ?
[9:47:34] grimyoulater: 46 was nice
[9:47:50] WikiDic: every diff batch will produce diff or stack
[9:47:57] grimyoulater: the 1$ might be rep
[9:48:01] fat_dabber: i guess you have to sell em all and record the highest price for that batch
[9:48:07] Sweetest_Ex: maybe diff areas offer diff payout or maybe raising rep also helps pay
[9:48:17] loooooney: You need to save for a car
[9:48:21] TheKhanGreen: @grimyoulater no from what tuggz said
[9:48:43] gamma_smash: need chodie to be your other bootlegger
[9:48:57] Sweetest_Ex: rain is such a vibe
[9:48:58] Kkaedal: They said it was a range of 5 bucks per case like 125-130 whitin the same batch

[9:50:00] MasonDesigns: Wasnt it 43
[9:50:01] TheKhanGreen: @gamma_smash tuggz and Ellie have been doing it so with gomer I think they have 3 runners
[9:50:09] Kkaedal: Maybe 43 i am not sure
[9:50:29] WikiDic: i wouldnt bother doing the paletto ones.
[9:50:33] WikiDic: so much extra time
[9:50:36] fat_dabber: cant you rent a car before you start the drops and it use that?
[9:50:40] WikiDic: for the test phase
[9:50:48] gamma_smash: @TheKhanGreen tuggz runs his own and ellie and vinny run there own
[9:51:15] WikiDic: the cost in gas and time there and back for just test not really worth it
[9:51:23] WikiDic: u got a variety and the 5 figure gap
[9:51:36] TheKhanGreen: I‚Äôd just save the bottle until you get more in that area then drop it off
[9:51:44] Torrok: WikiDic gotta spend money to make money
[9:51:58] WikiDic: yeah i didnt mean turf

[9:53:49] Kkaedal: Weird

[10:30:30] WikiDic: (not really 10k each run) but it avg's to 10k a run

[10:31:01] WikiDic: and they do cross over each other

[10:34:07] TheTruffleShuffle: maybe if two stack that may give you your next one
[10:34:40] WikiDic: what he means by 2 stacking was the 2 diff recipes stacked before labelling
[10:35:16] WikiDic: so their overall quality/proof mixture was the exact same.

[10:50:20] TheKhanGreen: @timmac I would just store the bottles somewhere because when you do have to go to those locations it‚Äôll be easy money since it should all be right next to each other
[10:50:51] WikiDic: nice
[10:51:00] ImRedmont: profits
[10:51:05] TheTruffleShuffle: that‚Äôs a keeper
[10:51:08] WikiDic: that just blew the rest out of the running so far
[10:51:09] KingJester: How long would it take to clean all that?
[10:51:43] OldKH: this is interesting, I'm hooked lol
[10:52:01] TheKhanGreen: @kingjester it‚Äôs slower now since he‚Äôs trying to find a good recipe but once it does they go pretty quick
[10:52:36] TheKhanGreen: because he then could stack addresses and organize bottles
[10:52:51] TheKhanGreen: to certain locations
[10:53:48] WikiDic: yep once he has his testing over he can pump all 6 unload em all and do it in stacks

[10:54:37] OldKH: yeah for science
[10:55:22] WikiDic: im thinkin so too
[10:56:09] OldKH: this car gear ratio is so bad LUL
[10:56:24] TheKhanGreen: yeah if stacks it‚Äôs most likely on the lower end so it wouldn‚Äôt be worth
[10:57:08] CWil2611: Might be good to have Chodie do the runs for you
[10:57:10] WikiDic: well the 3-10 wasnt lower end it was middle
[10:57:23] WikiDic: but it shares with something else so it isnt unique
[10:58:42] TheKhanGreen: you should see if you can borrow chodies civic for the runs
[10:59:18] HiimMoos3: 25?
[10:59:19] HiimMoos3: 26.
[10:59:40] HiimMoos3: Gotta take off my socks to do that math man
[11:01:09] OldKH: can you drink it
[11:01:13] WikiDic: sheesh
[11:01:47] ImRedmont: drink you best brews, thats what i always say
[11:01:54] ImRedmont: or i think thats what i say, lotta brews
[11:02:08] WikiDic: i shelf my best
[11:02:13] WikiDic: as they get better with age
[11:02:16] TheTruffleShuffle: maybe you get a dollar more if it‚Äôs a longer journey?

[11:06:05] WikiDic: well test phase one has paid for club rental
[11:07:04] TheKhanGreen: Did you see if chodie would let you use his car so you don‚Äôt have to get a rental
[11:07:19] WikiDic: well it has to hit high 50s
[11:07:25] WikiDic: to meet with the leader
[11:07:44] WikiDic: any mid to low 50s or less is below ur best
[11:08:02] fat_dabber: maybe load up with 1 bottle per batch then sell em all and see
[11:08:50] WikiDic: if u gunna rent a club for next run, i would say leave the rejects in this. as when u get the testing done u can offload all the large stacks
[11:09:00] WikiDic: if they havent degraded to nothing
[11:09:27] WikiDic: as it should still be thousands
[11:09:41] TheKhanGreen: @wikidic yeah have this car stashed up here for storage and use another car for the runs
[11:09:42] WikiDic: yep last single batch
[11:10:29] fat_dabber: just grab one of each and drop em off at the same time
[11:11:02] TheTruffleShuffle: use glove box?
[11:11:45] TheKhanGreen: @timmac I would use something as a divider so it doesn‚Äôt get mixed up
[11:11:54] flash_me_man: just do 2 out of each batch should be enough
[11:12:27] TheTruffleShuffle: are you best not carrying both when you sell?
[11:12:50] WikiDic: in the other city i live in i know someone who would pull out a rocket launcher on you if u took his fences out like that
[11:13:01] WikiDic: i play on public and another city all together
[11:13:23] WikiDic: the other city he is one of 3 ppl that know how to make rocket launchers
[11:13:33] WikiDic: 4yrs and only 3 have worked it out
[11:14:09] TheKhanGreen: @flash_me_man yeah exactly because if he only does one it‚Äôll always be + or - 5 of whatever it sells for

[11:14:39] ImRedmont: rip
[11:14:51] WikiDic: any from other batch at this spot
[11:16:15] eaglekidkid: it was three
[11:16:18] TheKhanGreen: do we know if ingredient order matters as well like if apple is first or last does it effect price?
[11:16:50] ImRedmont: Well thats good, only one perfect range batch
[11:16:50] WikiDic: so we have a clear winner
[11:16:52] TheKhanGreen: affect*
[11:17:12] WikiDic: yep
[11:17:35] WikiDic: may as well open all bottles
[11:17:38] WikiDic: for labels
[11:17:45] WikiDic: and stack em in trunk
[11:18:15] WikiDic: the reject stacks
[11:18:32] TheTruffleShuffle: I‚Äôd be tempted to cut a corner and do a batch with a ql then the four highest from what you‚Äôve just found out

[11:19:16] WikiDic: batch one was pure ql
[11:19:39] WikiDic: yep next wheel but last wheel goes nd
[11:19:53] WikiDic: your 1/5 of the way there
[11:20:17] TheKhanGreen: does ingredient order matter chat as well or no
[11:20:21] WikiDic: ql ql ql ? nd
[11:20:50] WikiDic: @TheKhanGreen cant confirm or deny, but most likely
[11:21:05] WikiDic: otherwise it will be too easy to get ur specail one
[11:21:30] WikiDic: instead of 100k possibilities it would be 20k
[11:23:35] TheKhanGreen: @wikidic I mean irl it wouldn‚Äôt matter because all of the liquid comes from the steam but it‚Äôs a game so‚Ä¶
[11:24:13] WikiDic: @TheKhanGreen irl it would matter, as adding in ingredients in different order will cause it to mix in different ways
[11:24:19] WikiDic: science
[11:24:57] WikiDic: otherwise you wouldnt add brandy to port at end you would add with everything else to make tawny port
[11:25:10] WikiDic: but no it just turns out crap if added too soon
[11:25:26] ImRedmont: Sewers?
[11:26:05] TheKhanGreen: but you get moonshine from all the steam of the ingredients so it all gets boiled no matter what
[11:27:36] ImRedmont: What causes it to go down?
[11:27:47] WikiDic: being above ground
[11:27:55] TheKhanGreen: @imredmont being out of the sewers
[11:28:08] ImRedmont: thats a neat concept
[11:28:11] WikiDic: 2 different realms
[11:28:20] WikiDic: mutants and normies
[11:28:44] WikiDic: normies efeected in mutant realm mutants effected in normie realm
[11:28:46] fat_dabber: honestly if it tanked super hard it would be dumb cuz you would never be able to go rp with people just stuck in the sewers all day

[11:30:11] WikiDic: so it could just be it being annoying
[11:30:23] WikiDic: they all new
[11:31:06] WikiDic: still put it there as that could be the correct one
[11:31:13] WikiDic: but u already got its price
[11:31:44] WikiDic: as it may be the one to continue onto next batch of tests
[11:31:58] WikiDic: could be why the huge leap between it and the one before
[11:32:04] WikiDic: as it could have 2 correct
[11:32:59] WikiDic: just dont need to run it again as such because it has been run
[11:33:34] WikiDic: it could be ql nd as the last 2 wheels

[11:35:13] WikiDic: @TheKhanGreen thats what i was saying, but still bring its results down in the table
[11:35:27] WikiDic: so it can still be a comparrison
[11:35:31] TheKhanGreen: @wikidic yeah true
[11:37:14] TheKhanGreen: I would also add a gap between each batch run so it doesn‚Äôt look all clumped up imo

[12:12:47] TheKhanGreen: that‚Äôs gonna be good money
[12:13:16] therealdankmoody: awesome! nice to get the crowbar, i know before i left you were hoping for one. making moves!
[12:14:39] TheKhanGreen: if tuggz isn‚Äôt using his stills can‚Äôt you double your progress or does he share his stills with other people?
[12:14:56] fat_dabber: do you have an apartment ?
[12:15:25] WikiDic: u know what would be a good discovery
[12:15:32] TheKhanGreen: @fat_dabber everyone one does
[12:15:37] WikiDic: if there was somewhere you could put water bottles leave em
[12:15:42] WikiDic: and they become dirty water
[12:16:27] WikiDic: or if it just degraded into old over time

[12:24:51] flash_me_man: your right toss everything that is harsh we are trying to build to average.
[12:25:05] TheKhanGreen: @timmac what if the proof goes off of your rep and the ingredients is what the quality goes off of
[12:25:23] flash_me_man: your right
[12:25:43] Armarthai: sell 2 only to check
[12:25:46] WikiDic: still worth unboxing and selling later with all the other rejects
[12:25:51] DJSquashy: ive been playing last epoch
[12:26:00] WikiDic: as still a couple k there
[12:26:16] flash_me_man: It just gets harder when it starts staying average and finding the best one.
[12:26:23] WikiDic: and worth double checking with at least one from each
[12:26:42] TheKhanGreen: @wikidic do you think he has even proof based off of his rep since it‚Äôs quality + proof like you said

[13:06:04] WikiDic: and 1 of them may be individually worked out as the proof
[13:07:25] WikiDic: its looking like your first below avg might be it
[13:08:06] WikiDic: yep when u run a batch and it throws the proof around, we know one wheel is locked to proof
[13:08:20] WikiDic: or they changed the way proof happens

[13:09:59] TheKhanGreen: open the other one you have on the ground see where it stacks
[13:10:31] TheKhanGreen: oh nvm because it‚Äôs a dupe anyway

[13:55:43] TheKhanGreen: yeah but why didn‚Äôt the two coarse ones stack but the other 3 did
