[6:02:18] openshowstv: @abdulhd so in this update everything started from zero? even previous history is vanished, like Abdul Mayor for example?
[6:02:20] unstoble1337: it only adds up problems sharing the house :D
[6:02:32] original_khawk: unless you really need the house because you really need the workbench like the people running the mechanic shop, there is no rush in getting a house NODDERS

[6:07:04] MrDevv93: Wait what happened to pusspuss?
[6:07:05] original_khawk: @openshowstv yeah, the lore is that the goverment collapsed after the end of 3.0, and its now 5 years later and people are slowly moving back into the city, but its a different government, so all businesses, assets, and everything is gone, and the PD is now under new leadership, so while some cops where able to get a job at the PD, its not a guarantee
