[1:29:56] hrafnagut: what about a CUM only diet
[1:29:57] D__Clone: @jenny12gauge the odds for it are so bad because they don’t tend to catch it early other wise it’s pretty treatable
[1:30:18] jenny12gauge: @Liriumn I could be incorrect but I think Penn Gillete went on a potato only diet to lose weight, he's still kicking

[1:59:36] AutoGuns: i miss Norm
[1:59:38] Dkacz05: Jo Koy makes me proud Macklemore is from seattle

[1:59:45] Liriumn: PainsChamp
[1:59:54] rando93: The woman before this dude was funnier... this one is kinda weak
[1:59:55] 1saint10: just let ricky gervais host for the rest of time
[1:59:55] Acco10x: STOP NOOOO
[2:00:04] SeanChristohper: edge master
[2:00:12] rando93: Good

[2:00:33] bekahbv: Ricky Gervais has said he won't host again.
[2:00:44] zenyatta: this guy is just having one of those nights where his jokes are either horrible or barely worth a chuckle
[2:00:47] Mezzedii: normie
[2:00:50] Resecure: WutFace normie
[2:00:52] Skythecow69: ok
[2:00:53] xMuxx: Norm was one of the best in history
[2:00:55] QuakerG: HOLY FUK as soon as you imitated Norm I heard beef
[2:00:58] ItsAmes1312: Beef at the comedy club when
[2:00:58] KingYamajii: Him blaming his , "joke writers" was wack. He should've just said, "sometimes you hti, sometimes you miss. hope ya'll just enjoyed who won. better luck next time."
[2:01:02] kingofmemesandcringe: He walked a fine line. Unlike some edgy comedians he usually walked that line where his jokes were edgy but not malicious
[2:01:07] zenyatta: i ask again could the GG not find another host
[2:01:11] soda_cero: where does this tradition of roasts in awards shows come from?
[2:01:11] rando93: Ohh i said good that he has a good Netflix Special cuz this is just edgy for no reason i think I agree with you edgy for the sake of edge is not funny
[2:01:12] SpilledBagofIce: Norm didn't seem like he cared if you laughed or not, which is what Gervais had going for him when he hosted...
[2:01:15] dooro7: Ricky gervais is really good in my opinion :)
[2:01:18] StreamElements: RESPONDED TO DAILY LIVE ON STREAM https://forms.gle/Fu9Yav7MLfik3msUA

[2:01:19] Mkay___: @hrafnagut @hamter_raptor good food, good company an assload of nostalgia & a lot of drinks. So much fun
[2:01:25] Dvicious012: This guy keeps punching down at writers who made movies instead of making fun of pretentious celebs right in front of him is wild
[2:01:30] Acco10x: British
[2:01:31] jenny12gauge: @zenyatta from what I recall, Jo was the first to say yes with 2 weeks left
[2:01:37] hamter_raptor: YUMP
[2:01:38] senpai_trapp: i got blind sided by saltburn LUL went into it not knowing anyhing
[2:02:00] HipsterSal: comedians cant go full regarded in 2024, there are so many snowflakes that their job is impossible to do @wakewilder
[2:02:01] scroatus: Tom hanks lol
[2:02:01] Rosiiwun: this is still soo good
[2:02:07] kingofmemesandcringe: This was the last time Ricky made me laugh. Much like Chappelle his shit is just hackey now
[2:02:10] scroatus: absolutely
[2:02:12] KingYamajii: yea for real
[2:02:13] alisoninaisle10: i thought ricky's bit was getting played out so he stopped doing it, like he shows up and looks down at everyone for being celebs it was good but can only do it so many ways
[2:02:31] jenny12gauge: mfer unironically using "snowflakes"
[2:02:34] 1saint10: i expect boomers to get mad at the sky
[2:02:37] WonderfuI: lmao
[2:02:39] dooro7: KKonaW the gawd damn snowflakes ❄️
[2:02:39] zenyatta: i legit thought tom hanks passed a few years ago wtf
[2:02:40] PANICBOMB_: nah its just that people figured out that punching down isnt tfunny
[2:02:42] senpai_trapp: @senpai_trapp it was really good, very unexpected and refreshing
[2:02:48] Rosiiwun: tom hanks had a really cool Last Meal ep that made me like him again
[2:02:51] ItsAmes1312: If you're comedy is all punching down, then you've lost the plot lol.
[2:02:56] Rosiiwun: but he has opp energy
[2:03:05] Rosiiwun: its soo good
[2:03:07] senpai_trapp: @senpai_trapp but all i can say its adult rated for a reason LUL
[2:03:10] josmone: idk how chappelle came back so hard and immediately got washed
[2:03:12] lush_puppies: last meal is an awesome show
[2:03:12] Mkay___: That last meal Ep was so good
[2:03:23] LizardBrainz: @themperorsnewgroove who determines what's down
[2:03:26] soda_cero: i feel like they just excuse "wokeism" when the problem is that the jokes are just bad
[2:03:28] Mkay___: Ramsay Last meal was also so good
[2:03:30] Dvicious012: It's funny how only older millionaire super famous comedians are complaining about not being able to be funny anymore and not young comics working circuits
[2:03:33] midzito: every single joke he has outside the trans stuff is killed
[2:03:37] midzito: killer*
[2:03:39] hamter_raptor: @Rosiiwun mhm i loved Hanks after his appearance on Craig Ferguson
[2:03:47] QuakerG: I think his first 2 specials after coming back are great, but you coudl already see some of the trans hate in there
[2:03:49] rando93: DAmn those dudes sitting there like they are dicussing a Hit that was ordered in the name of the Godfather KEKW
[2:03:49] midzito: ever watched louie? that shit is sooo good
[2:03:57] jenny12gauge: when the Louis CK stuff came out I was legit sad
[2:03:58] Acco10x: yuck
[2:04:00] kingofmemesandcringe: It's not even just about punching down. You can make edgy jokes at the expense of anyone, but if your base intent is malicious it poisons any attempt at pulling humor from situations
[2:04:00] twitchmemer1245: i love this!!
[2:04:02] freezerburn666: what did he do tie them down and tape their eyes open?
[2:04:04] xMuxx: its sad that Comedy movies are pretty much dead on arrival nowadays

[2:05:07] QuakerG: @gumboji Louie is some of my favorite TV of all time

[2:06:04] Rosiiwun: yeah fr
[2:06:07] Gringotts_: real and true
[2:06:13] Mkay___: Pretty inspirational that he came from goverment housing
[2:06:17] D__Clone: fuck

[2:06:20] Steinlagger: beefing

[2:07:47] 0_GamerMan_0: wake is a funny man to take someone like that and make it a joke
[2:07:48] Dvicious012: Louie was actually an insanely good Director and editor for his FX show he's crazy talented too bad he did some heinous shit
[2:07:49] LizardBrainz: your place of work is twitch
[2:07:49] LittleBlkDress: this is getting deep teenSIP
[2:07:50] alisoninaisle10: i think jo koy acknowledging his monologue is awful is worse for the reception of his monologue than it actually is but its funny to me

[2:09:57] boboshiv: why u feel aimed at hahha
[2:10:00] xMuxx: @wakewilder  that was kind of a bad comparison because it would be a 3rd party that would be throwing the person commenting on the lawyer out of the courtroom for disturbing the court room
[2:10:01] dooro7: @lizardbrainz your name holds true
[2:10:07] LizardBrainz: I didn't realize the vibes sir. I am sorry

[2:32:12] SleekDMC: "I'm spiritual" Hello
[2:32:28] bnsvnu: would someone that is just having fun with astrology answer they believe in it on a poll?
[2:32:44] gluuman: good question lol
[2:32:44] PWRslide2: If a chic mentions a "sign" within the first minute of conversation, I feel that is sus
[2:33:00] gluuman: do they self-identify as a “believer”
[2:33:00] SpilledBagofIce: Astrology is real because we live in a simulation & it's a way to save computational power, just assign certain characteristic to 1/12 different signs... LUL
[2:33:16] LegionerNero: Saying stuff like  "youre scorpio - so it's hard to make you talk" feels like it making a situation not about something between you two, but some determined on will of universe
[2:33:23] zenyatta: until you start wars in the name of astrology nobody will take it seriously
[2:33:26] SpilledBagofIce: (joking)
[2:33:34] Mezzedii: @zenyatta should we start one?
[2:33:35] MsErica: "if a chick"
[2:33:46] TwitchGurls: god is a concept created by man to control man....end of story
[2:33:54] Dvicious012: @zenyatta I wouldn't mind starting a world war to put those filthy Geminis in their place
[2:34:10] bnsvnu: maybe but astrology is arguably a lot more testable
[2:34:16] soda_cero: @SpilledBagofIce yeah you just cache that shit and it takes 0 effort, those servers arent paying themselves
[2:34:17] ImpendingAgony: @SpilledBagofIce We're stuck in a Bethesda game? docnotL
[2:34:25] QuakerG: I treat strology as other religions. Most people seem to engage in it casually, but if someone is hardcore into their beliefs is a bit of a turn off
[2:34:26] iAM_Duckyyy: but wake andrew tate told me its all bs
[2:34:40] boboshiv: how is it testable?#?.?
[2:34:40] gluuman: religion is a legitimate deal-breaker for persons on any side of the issue
[2:34:42] Acco10x: @wakewilder I think your Chinese zodiac sign is the dog
[2:34:46] D__Clone: when people are born in a year can affect a lot of things. there are many systemic things that are tied to your date of birth and these can influence your personality
[2:34:51] SpilledBagofIce: @soda_cero fer reals tho!
[2:34:54] MeatSoSmooth: I'd be equally skeptical of someone who brought up their religious prescriptions as a means of getting to know someone

[2:36:35] ImpendingAgony: @SleekDMC  🐰 SpringlesLong
