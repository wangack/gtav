[1:01:51] abraham8p: Why wouldn't they like it gives cops stuff to do like hunt down crims with warrants
[1:01:51] EvidentlyNova: It takes more effort to not wear a mask, then have to deal with the consequences of a warrant etc. That's literally the opposite LUL

[1:02:25] PyromaniacJoe: @yleciot, nakkiLove
[1:02:30] WhiteRoseAshes: i think no mask also creates more rp for cops because they can harass the people with the warrants
[1:02:35] squigglygoo: yeah aleks says it's cool pretty sure they just like to see some different idea thrown into the mix of regular jobs no mask season is just adding rp
[1:02:36] ginoxys: Nobody doesn’t like it, chat is just trying to stir shit
[1:02:44] TropicalToucan: I think they technically have 30 days to charge you with crimes so they could hypothetically stack like a week worth of crimes on you when they catch you
[1:02:45] HaterOfZero: Tobii hates that crims don't give a fuck
[1:02:48] QUOTE_IF_WINNER_POV: Yea
[1:02:48] DankPotate: voice sounds weirdly low
[1:02:50] ANDRO_core: you could argue that there is less investigation of actually finding out who the crim is but most cops dont even do that because crims would usually win in court anyway if they wore a mask and outlasted gsrt
[1:02:51] PeonCrotchski: coop is a troll, so of course he would say that.

[3:38:06] smore023: Meth = 9 lives
[3:38:09] Ghillied: Didn't it use to be 4v4
[3:38:09] toadloadmodechode: TRUE MVP Pog
[3:38:12] buttermode: Would you ever double up on meth or 1 meth 1 coke for shootouts? Or would that be to much
[3:38:12] TwistKid330: Mike needs a promotion
[3:38:13] pepsiplunge19: Crime should be hard
[3:38:13] jaylittyy: GivePLZ mike

[3:38:22] h0neybadgerz: @ghillied no
[3:38:23] RezaQ8: Nobody confirmed that ass meth got nerfed
[3:38:23] bumpa3: Dude you really think its fair when crims gets to plan everything and ambush if its 4v4 ?
[3:38:25] fisheye11: cause it would be the city against the police LUL
[3:38:27] mizar_and_alcor: Cops are reactionary, Crims get the initiative, that's probably why
[3:38:27] MattKnew: vagos ez clean sayeedTell
[3:38:28] CoCo11_: crims get the advantage of surprise and cops get the advantage of numbers
[3:38:28] LizardLunks: 🙂
[3:38:30] tiarimoore: I think Siz falling off of things is apart of his character at this point LuvPeekL
[3:38:33] placeholder2154: Complaining about the rules is what Chat and Reddit is for Pepega @UberHaxorNova
[3:38:35] RS_broody: mike the best meth head confirmed 4Head
[3:38:36] ryanstiIes: Crims have wiped PD plenty of times, so 4-man isn’t really an issue
[3:38:41] deltaoperative: it wouldnt be as bad if you could get rifles and such like before
[3:38:41] SpilledOrangeJuice: Its supposed to feel impossible, as if you were actually taking on a PD which would heavily outweigh any crew
[3:38:44] edgy_robin: Crims should be able to call back up in fights like this at least.
[3:38:45] cmSomber: Pretty sure mike killed everyone
[3:38:45] Yleciot: I think the main argument is because crim usually get to pick where the shootouts go down and set up
[3:38:49] its___Angel: @tiarimoore fr uhnKek
[3:38:49] ElCatrachoSamir: ji james
[3:38:50] lee_gandhis_nuts: Poop Pressured Mike is scarier than Tarkov Mike

[3:39:01] toadloadmodechode: @tiarimoore He slips and falls so much that by implication it is apart of his character uhnKek
[3:39:01] Yokota777: Yeah it makes it more challenging when it’s limited to 4. If anything it makes the crims better in the long run.
[3:39:01] afroman230: @moist_mail_man its acutal ass meth
[3:39:01] tiarimoore: @angelix101 uhnHeart uhnHeart uhnHeart

[5:28:21] oHazen_: People using it in jobs with personal cars was one reason
[5:28:26] mornelithevt: It's not even correct drip, it's not actually consuming NOS while it does that.
[5:28:31] YewW0TM8: KEKW
[5:28:33] thedeadwalkers: If you drip lets say your Lambo or RX7 it goes 330+ that is the issue people have with it @uberhaxornova
[5:28:35] Hazurdv: @invaderzim64387 Right. It’s hard to get and barely anyone wants to use it even with Siz trying to push it
[5:28:37] cloudboujee: @mornelithevt true
[5:28:58] CoCo11_: @demplantz the racers are the reason it got fixed, nos dripping ruined races and made certain cars crazy op
[5:29:07] bluefast123: dev should just make it so u can turn the drip off and have it take 1% every 30 seconds or something
[5:29:08] denracer: Is BS TBH if Grub can catch the Brawler is fine. the PD just complain about the buggy and Brawler being OP
