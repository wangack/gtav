[4:41:43] GonBonkin: @stellarnaut oh I thought you meant in custody lol
[4:41:44] Atokad2887: oh sorry didnt know we wernt allowd to have opinions about the some of the PD guys. ill stfu now XD
[4:42:18] Eddie1225: you just complaining about people showing up on streams and being a main character
[4:42:21] FinexLive: dumb shit probably LUL
[4:42:22] stellarnaut: its not a argument
[4:42:23] Eddie1225: thats not an opinion
[4:42:28] adod1111: THat person was responding to me I think
[4:42:30] GonBonkin: Different discussion from the deleted message
[4:42:38] stellarnaut: its not a argument i was just chatting with adod
[4:42:39] Atokad2887: no argueing. i was just stating im not a fan of cornwood is all
[4:42:47] Eddie1225: thats fine

[4:43:26] sendu6666: hes been too long?
[4:43:41] stellarnaut: @adod1111 lmao either way im not sure if its frowned upon but i think it shouldnt be
[4:44:08] OGprodigy: bobby's fingerprints were on it - timo's weren't but you said the pd would buy a better machine in the future
[4:44:16] Eddie1225: i like how every wipe

[4:44:37] adod1111: @stellarnaut I agree, just didn't know the general RP "rules" about it, I was wondering if they should send someone to hospital to wait for clowns or if that's like power gaming or whatever
[4:44:41] Alexqc19: Tbh hall was in 3.0 also
[4:44:47] Serakkis: So is this guy the PD attorney? Missed the start of it <3
[4:44:50] Icestruggler: Have they tested if an item has DNA after someone robs it from them? Since giving stuff doesnt produce it
[4:45:02] Hello_Kinnie: All the lawyers come out when ramees on break for the weekend xD
[4:45:09] Hello_Kinnie: Its refreshing
[4:45:10] Artsii1994: We knew he was a good one. I think I knew him from 3.0
[4:45:17] Atokad2887: i wasnt talking about the streamer. i was talking about the character itself. cornwood steals form the story alot, imo of course, like for example. lets say slacks, arhcer, and bobby are in a scene. the moment cornwood walks in it automatically becomes about him. thats what i ment. esfand as a streamer is an amazing person. i just wanna see more outside cornwood rp within PD :)
[4:45:17] urkuri92: @Serakkis he's been helping out a lot on PD cases

[4:46:48] stellarnaut: @adod1111 i feel like its not power gaming because the crim can recieve first aid and change clothes. PD should be able to wait at the hospital for you if your gonna show up wounded with the same outfit
[4:46:53] SoulYou_: boom

[4:50:25] vince620: Listen… In this world, whenever there is light, there are also shadows. As long as the concept of winners exist, there must also be losers. The selfish desire of wanting to maintain peace causes wars and hatred is born to protect love.

[12:37:45] Artsii1994: @jibry my brian is so fried I forgot what it said. I need to go back to the vod to read it again
[12:38:02] FrozenMexican2614: What happens when a character dies in RP? Can they not play that person again or do they just respawn?
[12:38:23] FleshSwag: When does this dude sleep
[12:38:25] Ned15: @FrozenMexican2614 perma means the character is ded ded, can't be played again
[12:38:30] lillukeii: mornin slacks
[12:38:33] Artsii1994: @frozenmexican2614 when a character permas there gone gone never coming back
[12:39:01] FrozenMexican2614: So basically it is a start over again for that player
[12:39:07] FrozenMexican2614: game over etc
[12:39:12] Artsii1994: @fleshswag the addiction is real. Crime never sleeps
[12:39:13] ClipsBott: {Use ' !clip  [title] ' command to create a clip that is automatically sent to the #twitchclips channel on Discord ClappyHype }
[12:39:20] lillukeii: @artsii1994 does that happen via Rp or can a character naturally perma
[12:39:54] lillukeii: like does the streamer decide to move on from the character or something
[12:40:05] xTurqeh: its the streamers decision
[12:40:16] lillukeii: makes sense
[12:40:18] Artsii1994: @knxghtstrykerr so that will be up to the player if they want to perma depending on the path they take in rp
[12:40:28] lillukeii: oh
[12:40:37] lillukeii: I’m new to the Rp scene
[12:40:39] AnusReaktorMan: Imagine throwing rock on this meeting om
[12:40:39] FrozenMexican2614: ohh okay that clears it up, thank you!
[12:41:41] Ned15: But then Leo didn't do it and Connor did hu
[12:41:51] Kasvar: sus duncan i know you're watching
[12:42:34] MDM4ever1986HD: like say the streamer is bored of the character or their voice blows because of the strain on their vocal cords they choose to perma
[12:42:51] MDM4ever1986HD: so how do they let the cops know they perrma?
[12:42:56] xBadMeowx: Is this the first Perma in 4.0?
[12:43:13] lillukeii: what happened I jus woke up
[12:43:14] Artsii1994: @xbadmeowx no this is not the first
[12:43:16] AnusReaktorMan: No
[12:43:18] Ned15: Well first of all they do it for their story LuL , they just let doctors know there is no pulse
[12:43:43] Ned15: no pulse, not responding, doctors ask if perma, they say yes
[12:44:00] Ned15: then doctor tells cops that they died
[12:44:02] MDM4ever1986HD: right but how do the cops know?
[12:44:14] MDM4ever1986HD: Ah okay
[12:44:16] Ned15: Doctor provides an autopsy
[12:44:20] xBadMeowx: @TheFMHatter1986 they do the text type thing to describe symptoms etc when ems or pd are attending to them
[12:44:21] surelyURjokingMrFeynman: Luigi was a troll/meme character so probably never intended to be long-lived
[12:44:29] Artsii1994: @thefmhatter1986 the player takes there character amd just does the story they want for their character and of they decide to perma they just go.to.the doctors and the doctors will inform cops that there dead.
[12:44:54] MDM4ever1986HD: right make sense I've not seen many perma characters before
[12:44:59] xTurqeh: or they could RP that theyre moving away or something if they didnt want to kill them off
[12:45:13] MDM4ever1986HD: I've seen one perrma but not characters that are well known
[12:45:13] xJusahog_: Luigi was my favorite because he could jump higher
[12:45:41] MDM4ever1986HD: do well known characters have been known to perma?
[12:45:53] Artsii1994: @christiannnnnnnnn yea they rp like there going to the airport if they want to move away. Got to rp it out
[12:46:09] AlienatedFL: I think we have a case of transferred intent
[12:46:18] AlienatedFL: they intented to kill leo it seems
[12:46:23] Ned15: LuL
[12:46:25] Ned15: plan gone wrong
[12:46:29] GlitchyByte: he orchestrated his own demise
[12:46:51] Omerhur: Andrews is gonna laugh when he finds out Luigi's dead KEKW
[12:46:52] GlitchyByte: foisted by his own petard
[12:46:52] HeyMeghan: RIP NeskRp’s (Duncan) other character.
[12:47:18] Artsii1994: So Luigi wanted to kill leo but tje tables turned and the murder went to Luigi instead
[12:47:40] StreamElements: Make sure to check out my Youtube Channel!  saabHype -  https://cutt.ly/SaabYT
[12:47:41] AlienatedFL: it should be premeditated cause the stabber had a guilty mind (mens rea) to stab leo but stabbed another :)
[12:47:46] GlitchyByte: yep
[12:47:52] JulianK120: Who is speaking?
[12:47:53] Artsii1994: Yea
[12:47:57] HeyMeghan: @artsii1994 what confuses me is why would he 911 that if he intended for Leo to be the one dead
[12:48:12] Artsii1994: @juliank120 penny lane new cadet
[12:48:34] lillukeii: penny lane Probaly one of my favorite cops
