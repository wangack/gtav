[9:36:17] chaosdunking: NotLikeThis
[9:36:18] beka2988: then fine money should come to the pd not the state

[9:36:42] skinnylegend000: congrats Beric your whole force just quit.
[9:36:42] HideAwayx: Ok so does the PD get the payout from fines then?, State has to pay it way forward by this logic
[9:36:43] RadahTatTat: but… what do ppl buy from the PD?? KEKW it’s not a business like GRIME
[9:36:48] kasper952: AWKWARD
[9:36:52] FlameReetardantPanda: can we just give the money back
[9:37:09] magnets_: god this is slimy as fuck

[9:39:20] VSDuck: AAAA
[9:39:21] yarddonky69: u o them now

[9:39:47] RadahTatTat: NODDERS yeah
[9:39:47] BluSphinx: Just give the money back
[9:39:53] barrbeequeue: For real, if the vehicles & equipment are property of the PD then none of the money from fines should go to the state.
[9:40:09] frsttyyy: why would pd bother billing people if, 85% of that goes to the state and pd dont get any of that money?
[9:40:09] dastardlywilko: Well.... time to slap red and blue lights on a Grime truck and drop parcels and criminals LUL
[9:40:14] Asmodean01: well only 25k was said to be spent, so it's not all that hard to pay back in a day or two
[9:40:15] Nts_man: Wait the fines don't go to the PD?
[9:40:15] Powercope: This is actually crazy
[9:40:16] skinnylegend000: just send it back and stop giving the state jail fine money.

[9:40:33] BluSphinx: @barrbeequeue I like that all fines go towards the pd budget
[9:40:41] SymbioAgori: patrol guy
[9:40:43] magnets_: i think they wanted to keep him on the streets
[9:40:44] themanwithanrx7: didn;t play the politics

[9:40:54] barrbeequeue: @BluSphinx Agreed
[9:40:56] SimplyOrt: so he picked a cop just to throw this at him? the mayor has been pretty weird recently
[9:40:57] MFaustus: didn't yap enough
[9:40:58] Asmodean01: Might have wanted him on the street more then paperwork king
[9:41:03] RadahTatTat: patrol plus beric played the politics HARD
[9:41:03] squonk513: youre a actual good cop
[9:41:06] themanwithanrx7: the politics aint worth it

[9:44:26] adzno: fl0mSmort
[9:44:26] ericalynn21: LOL

[9:44:29] ericalynn21: Dork

[9:45:26] SimplyOrt: it just seems like the mayor has been shoving his nuts in the pd face all week lol
[9:45:28] Kevin_D_Gate: So, are the police a part of the city/state or is it private?
[9:45:29] VSDuck: I understand them not paying for people to buy cop cars but for repairs? that doesn't make sense
[9:45:39] Bi0_: They want all jobs to pay for themselves like G6 has to buy their own gear/repairs, sani, etc... so they want pd to do it now too.................
[9:46:06] Bi0_: you'll never do it again.
[9:46:09] RadahTatTat: it doesn’t make any sense since the PD doesn’t sell anything, it’s not a company like Grime

[9:53:17] beehiveyourself: BUT, have you considered that if Mcnulty was chief, he could make it allowable to come into duty intoxicated
[9:53:24] etopplol: @magnets_ wait, where do you think that hourly pay of PD comes from ?
[9:53:24] amber_bijoux: does that mean beric can do all the interviews lol

[9:58:24] themanwithanrx7: ADHD act :D
[9:58:36] BooksBlanketsandTea: how the hell do they expect that to work when it's a known problem that lights can show differently for different people? Or all lights can be red at the same time?
[9:59:42] BooksBlanketsandTea: True. I suppose it's like the lines on the side of the road showing red for some people and yellow for others.

[10:03:57] xTurqeh: @SimplyOrt she did, she came back for the meeting
[10:05:20] SimplyOrt: @Christiannnnnnnnn well yeah but she wanted to 42 for the night yk what i mean
[10:05:36] xTurqeh: imagine what Aldo's reaction is gonna be when he finds out one of his best officers quit LUL
[10:05:49] chivvyy: o7
[10:06:03] squarejkl: which officer quit?
[10:06:06] Switchblade142: @Christiannnnnnnnn wait what? I just got here, who quit? Lovesick?
[10:07:01] BooksBlanketsandTea: Lovesick quit after being hit by PD crossfire. He was dealing with a war vet robbing a downed officer - he believed the vet needed help, PD shot, Lovesick AND the vet got shot (I believe)
[10:08:42] Nightbot: Come join the discord and fill up the ranks! https://discord.gg/PMrxK3F
[10:10:01] CoherentScreams: Is anyone going to bring up, should officers open fire if one of their own is in the line of fire?
[10:11:07] Najb0lji: what the hell why!?
[10:11:12] CoherentScreams: My bad if you were getting there and I jumped the gun not my intent
[10:11:30] TheBFG_01: Was it verbalised that he was de-escalating to taser?
[10:11:35] Panos_97: Panos_97 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[10:12:37] sukuna299: i fee llike there was no trust in this situation
[10:13:20] ctsblindsniper: i know its OOC but wouldnt that mean you know their animation locked and open fire on a person with a UIopen
[10:13:26] sukuna299: if fellow offisers cant trust that  some one can deescalate the situation help him not shoot directly at the same area he is
[10:14:05] VSDuck: @ctsblindsniper Doesn't really matter as that would be an OOC thing I believe
[10:14:17] sukuna299: this situation sounds fucked and tbh if my coworker shot at my direction as my trying to deesculate a situation i would quit too cause idk what that coworker would to me another time
[10:14:40] ctsblindsniper: @VSDuck OOC to acknowldge the UI but to Fire knowing that they are and treat it like its not Is kinda powergaming ain a sense
[10:15:34] Jerren: or run people over LUL
[10:15:54] lostsage540: "i know you are robbing this cop for their gun but can you cancel animation os i can shoot you?"
[10:15:59] VSDuck: @ctsblindsniper I mean yes and no I think that's a situation by situation basis because what happened the "being in UI" doesn't matter as they aren't really fighting you know? they are just being talked to
[10:16:05] VSDuck: I do get what you are getting at though
[10:16:32] skinnylegend000: the warning time is sufficient to get out of any UI issues and either flee or take cover or return fire or communicate.
[10:17:03] ctsblindsniper: @VSDuck 100% like im not tryna fight a arugment i Just mean it as If you know they are animation locked robbing wait a sec use verbal and then use action after animation lock is over?
[10:17:25] humanhere2: Wouldn't that still apply to the original situation?  hostage for the bank?  that's a violent felony
[10:17:30] lostsage540: getting caught robbing someone isnt an excuse to not get shot
[10:17:40] VSDuck: @ctsblindsniper OH I guess yeah you could but in terms of RP it doesn't matter
[10:17:51] lostsage540: otherwise you can get in a shootout and start robbing someone and go "powergaming!"
[10:18:21] SimplyOrt: in a shootout *pauses game* EZ
[10:18:38] JediJacob_: your honor objection: power gaming
[10:18:47] Defonicx: mechanics arguments saabCringe
[10:18:49] SoooooperSlam: jsut stay in the robbing ui till storm. get off free EZ
[10:18:57] lostsage540: being stuck in animation is what they call "caught lacking"
[10:18:58] Derkatronic: Your honor, objection, you weren't there, bro
[10:19:01] Seomiyo: OBJECTION, SKIP
[10:19:46] VSDuck: I think TvG needs to be fucking DRILLED into people heads at this point
[10:19:55] humanhere2: I think that's fine...largely because I think you can't have someone use that tactic over and over
[10:19:56] VSDuck: cuz holy shit it's like they don't know it
[10:20:16] ThomasTheDestroyer: PD doesn't utilize Tenn v Garner off the rip when the kidnapping to have a hostage at the scene of the robbery. So the same crime is treated differently in regards to use of lethal force. Sometime fun has to win over being literal as a cop on an RP server.
[10:20:32] mmajeter2: I’d love to hear the case law one more time please
[10:22:32] chivvyy: this case law is always weird in the city because pretty much every heist involves a hostage and could justify shooting
[10:22:33] VSDuck: Yeah 100% it should have just been "Hey stop robbing that cop or I'll shoot" (doesn't stop) Three shots to the chest ezpz done deal
[10:22:39] WarpIRL: KEKW
[10:22:45] ctsblindsniper: Is that IRL law and how its stated Or how its implied in the sever as alot of case laws dont tech apply in the city and have been overrulled?

[10:23:03] LogicWeasel: Prayge Brudder Turner.
[10:23:04] VSDuck: @chivvyy Yes and no The hostage has to not be in the line of fire for it to be used
[10:23:05] CoherentScreams: @mmajeter2 It is why today, every cop at every interaction endless screams, they are reaching for their waistband. Once they can establish someone is "reaching" lethal force is allowed and excused and they have qualified immunity for killing someone, even if later it turns out they were unarmed. If the officer "thought" they were armed or about to be armed, they can mag dump and get away with it...
[10:23:08] LogicWeasel: Hallowed be thy name

[10:25:04] tacopocalypse710: custyPinkJAM
[10:25:19] ThomasTheDestroyer: @VSDuck Right, but one they are in the cars, the cops could open fire and it would be justified in the eyes of the law. But that would be shitty and unfun, so they don't do it.
[10:25:20] mmajeter2: @coherentscreams makes sense in irl... to a certain point, in rp it is a little weird. I’m not sure about the laws in rp
[10:25:30] ericalynn21: @simplyort ohh interesting
[10:25:36] skinnylegend000: !meta
[10:25:37] Nightbot: Metagaming is giving Custard information that his character does not know. Metagaming is strictly prohibited in this chat. Any offenders will be timed out, and repeat offenders may be banned

[10:26:11] SimplyOrt: @ericalynn21 yeah moons chat was pissed lol they were mad at him for accidently messin with rubys head like that
[10:26:39] VSDuck: @ThomasTheDestroyer well no the reason they don't do it is because they negotiate for "Free passage" I guess that's the "Would be shitty and unfun" part of it but yeah I get what you mean
[10:26:56] warmachine89: I'm still gobsmacked about the money thing.
[10:27:06] Bannanabread04: Shit did I miss the baised chat about monies
[10:27:25] ThomasTheDestroyer: @VSDuck Yes, that would be the shitty and unfun part. There is nothing binding them, legally, to adhere to the terms of the negotiations.
[10:27:43] warmachine89: Dispatch MVP
[10:28:10] lostsage540: administrative?
[10:28:13] tacopocalypse710: almost overqualified?
[10:28:14] ThomasTheDestroyer: Max biffed the fuck out of the second half of that announcement
[10:28:17] WhosHumble: not a front runner
[10:28:20] Axcennts: like shes pro administrative ?
[10:28:28] Valagore: moonmoon flubbed big time, he didn't mean it the way he said
[10:28:31] skinnylegend000: she’s the best driver on the force idk what he’s on about.
[10:28:33] TheBFG_01: he said he didn’t think the PD needed an administrative Chief

[10:29:17] Axcennts: that's a W
[10:29:21] VSDuck: @ThomasTheDestroyer is there really nothing Legally about trying to get the Hostage out safe? and wouldn't that fall under adhering to the negotiations? (genuinely don't know and curious)
[10:29:28] mmajeter2: rightfully so
[10:29:37] SimplyOrt: they whole money thing is bugging me lol not even bc the pd has to pay but the underlined meaning of it

[10:30:17] thedeagie50: missbo10LOVE missbo10LOVE
[10:30:20] ThomasTheDestroyer: @VSDuck Once the suspects are in the car and the hostage is out of the way, nothing legally binds the officers to honor the LS Special

[10:32:03] Axcennts: Mcnut really needed on the field
[10:32:04] Rivath: It's because Mcnulty hates meetings/talking/managing
[10:32:06] WhosHumble: I feel McNulty didn't show alot of the paper side of policing, not that he isn't good at it
[10:32:14] WarpIRL: COPIUM
[10:32:24] magnets_: Sargent coming next week Prayge
[10:32:27] wavep987: Ruby mentioned McNulty as the top people for Chief. His time will come by gradually rising instead of playing politics.

[10:32:50] WarpIRL: impossible
[10:33:07] TheBFG_01: I was really hoping that if McNulty was made chief, he’d implement a timer, and would walk out of meetings when the timer runs out

[10:38:01] Kevin_D_Gate: I meeeeeeeeeean
[10:38:11] WhosHumble: i mean just give all officers their own car

[10:41:52] jinnytolls: But then why should the state get 85% of fines?
[10:42:12] warmachine89: Because the PD is a city service that the city needs to keep running.
[10:42:17] Axcennts: Crane said it, 0% of the state account is for gov businesses
[10:42:17] BakinPacman: basically pd should track down serial offenders of not repairing and car usage
[10:42:18] lindsayisthecraic: in characper
[10:42:29] VSDuck: The state unless you buy one right?
[10:42:31] warmachine89: Frankly, PD, EMS, and Sanitation should ALL be city-funded services.

[10:44:00] Ehnita: IC cops making 5-10x less then other civ jobs is also kinda wack
[10:44:10] WarpIRL: just  like the time Sweets pulled over Nancy for going 1 mph over the speed limit
[10:44:25] VSDuck: State owned cars should be paid for by the state personal owned cars should be out of pocket
[10:44:36] warmachine89: @VSDuck 100%
[10:44:47] Mandrenn: yeah crims gotta pool makes sense pd should have to as well. especially since they have a lot higher numbers.
[10:44:56] xTurqeh: heres a question. what would they do if they didnt pay back the $300k? fire people from an understaffed PD?

[10:45:29] Kaelath_The_Red: D: the what
[10:45:42] VSDuck: @Christiannnnnnnnn No they put an interest on it so it'll just keep going up and up and up so when the PD can get money they won't get shit
