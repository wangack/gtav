[3:22:05] nasarat_blast: Oscuh needs to think about where weed leads to
[3:22:05] martymagoo78: of course they are, but that being a resource they can both use like butcoin, it would make sense to discuss first is all‚Ä¶ a hustle is cruelly bringing in money to the crew‚Ä¶ selling butcoin for yourself is not for the crew lol
