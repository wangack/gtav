[1:02:30] Bill_Collector: So speedy knows there's a system for weed but he doesn't know that same system applies to everything that produces dirty money?
[1:02:33] ChillTyme: serious isn't fun
[1:02:45] Poor_Scum: @SayeedBlack maybe have a big crew meeting and tell them how you really feel
[1:02:50] Pistol922: the people in the union also have good money
[1:02:57] twosix13: teddy cloak buddhaCheer
[1:02:58] mCerti: He got so much free shit so far KEKW
[1:03:13] Bill_Collector: Gigi gotta bust out the flow chart
[1:03:14] qHaydos: was shpeedy gonna run laundry with marty larry oscar and jp later? @SayeedBlack
[1:03:19] crownberriess: yea, Lang did say that
[1:03:19] versayanaa: @bill_collector they said if you your own resources you can keep 100%
[1:03:24] ChillTyme: @g0m3rrrr he has money from others too that he has yet to give from the one he has
[1:03:26] iiidaaah: @g0m3rrrr I mean that's straight up wrong just with math. Not saying he hasnt shnaked. But even if he makes just 1 dollar per material, which he did for long, selling 15k to mary every second day
[1:03:34] versayanaa: use*
[1:03:39] warkid123: @g0m3rrrr well, it's a volume game. 1$ per Material sale, but the volume was like guessing 200k+ (not even thinking about Circuit boards)
[1:04:03] khaled_5655: MISTAAA LANGGG
[1:04:34] mCerti: He will probably say that the crew have access to roof thing because of the crew
[1:04:40] ChillTyme: Chatting holy redditor essays
[1:04:48] HighToker: if you want nice things, you should use the money you get from kick backs not working jobs solo
[1:04:49] g0m3rrrr: another reality check - if you only do crime based jobs, 30% goes to the crew. if you do 'civ jobs' you don't have to kiick up
[1:04:54] Foenemn: sayeedK

[1:06:34] MattarChawal: Yeayhhh that’s Harry’s character trait IC. He was talking about Tony to Lang constantly but then acting like he has Tony’s back
[1:06:54] ProngsAedan: people are also not in the app to push on the turf.
[1:06:57] pluxd: the weed shit is dumb if you look that you make like 700 an hour and you have to also pay 10k a week while buying lockpicks/bandages etc
[1:06:59] VADICKUS007: I think Harry just doesn’t like Speedy
[1:07:00] WentToBuyMilkAgain: It's same as tony situation
[1:07:11] sighfye: I'm not sure if certain Dons should be Dons
[1:07:15] 0xD10DE: big true
[1:07:20] mCerti: Money and Lang
[1:07:20] ProngsAedan: facts
[1:07:29] Teddsan: ramone and stevie quit ?
[1:07:39] madsol_: thats kinda the point of a criminal organization tho
[1:07:39] twosix13: buddhaKEKW
[1:07:51] electroKellt: yeah Harry was saying the math for speedy kickback doesn't check out when it does LUL
[1:07:52] Blacklisted_: 18k also the only money made in the entire week
[1:07:55] anakinnotthekids: How much did Octo make?
[1:07:58] warkid123: The Harry line: "There are a lot of opportunities out there. Take them" and no word more KEKW
[1:07:59] NoTaGain15151: @MattarChawal i knw that's not the reason but it's meta to tell
[1:08:03] ProngsAedan: he never calls anyone and then says people don't call him KEKW as a Harry viewer that is like the funniest to me. He never calls you to update or anyone else.
[1:08:05] sm0keo: D:
[1:08:06] fumpingfump: octo made 11k iirc?
[1:08:10] jfelisario: 11k
[1:08:12] ChillTyme: gang shit
[1:08:13] mCerti: Does feel like Harry's loyalty is just to Lang, not the dons
[1:08:24] m0re_AL: m0re_AL subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[1:08:24] StreamElements: m0re_AL just subscribed for 3 months in a row PogChamp
[1:08:31] Pink_but: Hey just joined what is Speedy mad about?
[1:08:32] Disihe211: so octo cleaned 110k and got 11k?
[1:08:34] scarthy: how much did flash get paid out?
[1:08:40] electroKellt: @mCerti that's 3.0
[1:08:41] ChillTyme: Speedy slowly itching to El Jefe..... its a shlow burn
[1:08:43] acbr2001: Harry loyalty is to the CASH
[1:08:44] heysongr8: 3.0 Harry loyalty was to Lang
[1:08:45] WentToBuyMilkAgain: Harry just cares about his own money
[1:08:59] warkid123: i don't even think Harry ever thinks about "loyalty" - it's just not how he ticks
[1:09:05] mCerti: @electroKellt I am a Harry watcher. Feels the same LUL
[1:09:07] finsane1: only 2k in bank. carrying around 40k LUL
[1:09:09] jfelisario: @disihe211 he did other stuff besides cleaning, chopping etc
[1:09:16] blackenHH: HAHAhaha no choice
[1:09:24] ProngsAedan: so technically Speedy only got 18k and Harry was mad abt that... It's not 60k
[1:09:28] VADICKUS007: that’s so little. Poor ramone
[1:09:29] NoTaGain15151: @WentToBuyMilkAgain if he didnt he would just do g6 or grime , he mostly care about rep
[1:09:35] sighfye: Harry is defo on demon time in 4.0
[1:09:38] electroKellt: @mCerti same here and he seems much more selfish in 4.0 bit I could be wrong

[1:11:23] mCerti: Where you travelling to?
[1:11:25] sighfye: I think this system is bound to fail because as Long said it's based on trust.but as soon as people start pocket watching the trust goes

[1:33:59] warkid123: to be fair, that's your most solid defense

[1:39:57] quassaarr: pointless
[1:39:58] GCLladd: The irony of what Harry did by calling out what Arush is doing is that he is doing the exact same thing himself, I'm not 100% sure but I think he hasnt declared all the side money he is earning

[2:08:29] D3V1LCAZ: Pog
[2:08:46] error_code5: @reggatv pretty much harry said some stuff to lang when speedy was asleep and twisted some stuff so now people think speedy is snaking the crew
[2:08:46] samdz31: the meeting today will be spicy
[2:08:50] ChrisPNutssss: @lunate87 wait so is that true tho?
[2:08:59] itskvn__: @gclladd what does Harry do though?
[2:09:08] MattarChawal: Speedy is the most honourable guy lowkeyyy. If he’s shhhnaking he’ll tell you. 4.0 he ain’t snaked the boys attttttt all so Harry going around his back and portraying that imagine is fucked
[2:09:12] armzie33HD: ye went straight to lang told him after they spoke what was said
[2:09:18] Bilsk_: what time is the meeting happening?
[2:09:18] ChrisPNutssss: okok
[2:09:35] GCLladd: @itskvn__ Harry has side hustles in every criminal activity which he keeps to himself
[2:09:46] dd752: not all the time?
[2:09:54] MattarChawal: Imagine if Speedy told Lang that Harry is snaking with materials
[2:09:57] aut08blaster: Yes and no.... i think he didnt understand the difference between Speedy and Tony. When comes to money handling. In my opinon
[2:10:05] error_code5: @bilsk_ don’t know yet when lang is around and maybe the other dons
[2:10:12] ChrisPNutssss: interesting
[2:10:24] sighfye: I think everyone is in the wrong
[2:10:27] riadray: punch boss man
[2:10:31] lunate87: harry throws everything into the stash, then he realized today he can wash in vu then he started to overcook his ideas
[2:10:36] itskvn__: I honestly think it is just miscommunication.
[2:10:38] Dennis_VR_: call someone to buy
[2:10:38] Moobot: Show some sayeedLOVE for the Speedy song sayeedTell sayeedTell sayeedTell https://soundcloud.com/outtotunetyrone/imtellinyou

[2:11:22] Doctor_Smoker: tbh I think you all should get out of this downwards spiral, the negativity is high now...
[2:11:27] WHOISL1KEGOD: Point is Harry's snaking telling thing after speedys leaves
[2:11:33] Pajano255: Chat gotta learn to sit back and enjoy the rp
[2:12:02] redhoodsquad: Sounds like Harry is covering his own ass throwing Speedy under a bus
[2:12:02] Bilsk_: so essentially harry doesn’t have the balls to say it in front of speedy
[2:12:08] thinkachad: sorry chat joined late, what did harry snake about?
[2:12:08] slumvillager: chatters trying desperately to steer Speedy towards leaving the crew
[2:12:19] sighfye: @mattarchawal then why is Arush admitting Lang is not wrong?
[2:12:30] ShreddedFPS: ok but what i dont understand, even if speedy is washing his cash, whats the matter? you can do it. its your choise. as long as you also do crew stuff i dont see any problem in it
[2:12:37] WHOISL1KEGOD: And speedy take lang nagging of the washing machine LUL
[2:12:38] aut08blaster: You got a point, but Harry thinks out loud then over thinks 😅
[2:12:40] Larkkone: Hello speedy & chat
[2:12:44] riadray: I think speedy should ocean dump harry
[2:12:48] simplysavvy793: Essentially Harry talks about people when they are not around instead of having a open dialog with the person or in Don meeting
[2:12:54] kiwiTILT: this is some company shit lol
[2:13:15] itskvn__: Yeah
[2:13:21] hoopz21: Harry been throwing speedy under the bus for 5 years lmao
