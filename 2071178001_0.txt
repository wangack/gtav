[3:26:31] muzackx: sntLost
[3:26:39] lucho724_: so maybe they raised the price
[3:27:06] r3_clay: no more laundromat once you progress?

[3:27:50] Tillizz: did you do the laundromat on that pc so its on cooldown?
[3:28:04] milkydeew: Maybe worth buying it if it's a random drop?
[3:28:16] ss_dhillon: Ye maybe
[3:28:16] Estimationed: That would be my guess
[3:28:17] Eemelii: why would the other pc have a t2 tho
[3:28:32] r3_clay: would prevent 2 people from buying the same thing and not being able to hit is.
[3:28:33] manny_281: I guess i'm saying its suppose to show 2 of them but for now its only showing the tier 2 one
[3:28:34] uhhMrHappy: blobDance Hands on your knees blobDance
[3:28:35] lucho724_: t2 thing may just be devs raising the price
[3:28:43] ss_dhillon: sntHmm
[3:28:43] lucho724_: so ppl don’t hit it 3 times a storm
[3:29:28] ss_dhillon: sntSpin
[3:29:34] infinitemoon87: ashlolDance2 ashlolDance2
[3:29:41] xsgem01: @lucho724_ yea but why would they change it from tier 1 to tier 2?
[3:29:47] xStaticPulse77x: does the money guy have a tier associated with him?
[3:29:47] lucho724_: like the personal cooldown was new after ppl hit it multiple times in 1 storm
[3:30:03] turntablist_mk2: could be just a tag change
[3:30:37] manny_281: I'd bet we are dealing with world scuff and you should only be seeing T1 not T2
