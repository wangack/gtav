[1:30:23] TastyKudzu: My prediction is that everyone wants the tea but that no one wants to give up anything important they might have learned. Like why tell everyone else how to kill Norman if you know? Knowledge is power.
[1:30:31] AshuraX13: Sniper bullets are spiritual? katesLol
[1:30:43] Crafty_Crystal: What can Nancy even say. She doesn’t have a deal and he mostly just seems lonely and shows up. katesLol
[1:30:49] A_Humble_Wooper: Everything that has been tried was tried. That IS how that works, Flop.
[1:31:00] doc_sharon: well, RIP

[1:33:10] kangg: Isaac a good piece of info for nancy
[1:33:15] TastyKudzu: Could be interesting to tell everyone that Baas is the reason that Norman returned... Imagine the spice.
[1:33:18] ArlenArmageddon: Oh is that Tessa behind Collin?
[1:33:25] doc_sharon: chat, no confirmation of the guesses - would be meta

[1:40:27] HurricaneChapman: If you start every sentence with "I'm not _thisGuy, but.." people are going to think you're _thisGuy.
[1:40:46] oskarbaby: but norman reffering to we in his journal predates hime being death at all
[1:40:48] arcaneskies: HUHH

[1:41:15] SleepingSmurf: SleepingSmurf subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[1:41:19] doc_sharon: Norman is neutral in death, but the deals are all Norman.  Doesn't mean he's two people katesPlot

[1:41:54] lorddracnor: @mohler_47 I don't think anybody is going to expose real info because there isn't trust in this group for eachother.

[1:46:32] MyNameisTiff_: I'm convinced that Norman started speaking in the third person just to mess with everyone.
[1:46:38] TastyKudzu: Seems like she's hypothesizing that Norman isn't seeing over ALL deaths so maybe there's multiple deaths as opposed to a single entity?
[1:46:45] ScutiFruti: not just Norman that rules death tho..
[1:46:54] Count_Nodonora: Because there are other entities doing the job, it's teamwork
[1:46:59] Insaif: I get what she's saying, but it's hard to explain quickly.

[1:49:19] Insaif: @that_monkey Right now, the only soul left with the body is Cody.
[1:49:19] lorddracnor: RIP Dark
[1:49:21] Kthanid: @that_monkey there are no more seperate personalities, they all exist outside of each other now.
[1:49:21] Twaintoss: @skytramp Yeah, Andi even extended it because the deal is actually beneficial to her LUL
[1:49:21] abblepiewit: katesRip then

[1:50:37] luke_rp_: that*
[1:50:51] doc_sharon: people have tells
[1:50:51] Crafty_Crystal: Norman is still just a man endowed with powers from death. If he was actually death he would be impartial so it kinda makes sense if they’re both the same and separate.
[1:51:00] choochadoobie: who is standing by collin?
[1:51:08] skytramp: People who know what happened to Dundee know
[1:51:09] if0rg0t2remember: Tess

[1:52:17] fruzsi_na: Collin didn’t go through with it because someone else did it instead, no?
[1:52:27] if0rg0t2remember: Dundee arguably didn't and did follow through. So did TJ's
[1:52:29] skytramp: the thing is, Dundee didn't really uphold his deal in the end. He was stopped
[1:52:34] skytramp: its TJ's deal bringing Dee back
[1:52:46] CAYKE__: everyones deal is fullfilled so far.
[1:52:47] doc_sharon: facts

[1:54:12] A_Humble_Wooper: !what
[1:54:12] Nightbot: This is the "Council of Bones" aka BoneCon! Nancy, Collin, and a lot of other disguised people are meeting to... share info about Norman, and hopefully come up with a plan to deal with him? Supposedly. katesJuice
[1:54:35] if0rg0t2remember: Collin actually fairly talkative
[1:54:43] that_monkey: Now why won’t ppl actually say their deals. I’ve never heard a clause saying “if you say your deal you break the deal” so why not say them
[1:54:47] aideenx98: samee
[1:54:52] MamaSolaine: This feels like an Agatha Christie novel scene....like I'm waiting for the big bad to show up and the screams.
[1:54:53] tomwattschem: yeah hes talking more than i expected
[1:54:55] doc_sharon: he's making great points, though
[1:54:57] ArlenArmageddon: Or he just hangs out if you're Nancy and Andi katesLol
[1:55:00] Crafty_Crystal: Collin offered first katesSip
[1:55:05] JesTheRed: i mean he's right
[1:55:05] ThomasTheDestroyer: I feel like Collin is talking because Collin is tired of this shit.
[1:55:10] Insaif: Collin has a tendency to try to correct people, even to his own detriment, it seems.
[1:55:11] grrlfriday: he's too much of a leader to stay quiet
[1:55:14] oskarbaby: to be fair andi did beat him at his own game
[1:55:30] A_Humble_Wooper: Copper.
[1:55:33] skytramp: Cops who have long standing knowledge of him, yeah
[1:55:33] doc_sharon: true

[1:55:49] luke_rp_: Does it tho?
[1:55:52] recklessgallifreyan: Could be Snow Kappa
[1:55:53] Corlic1: I'm glad that Collin is. Can talk without disclosing information or key information.
[1:55:55] skytramp: Copper
[1:55:55] A_Humble_Wooper: Copper's intonation, and having that long a knowledge of Norman.
[1:56:02] skytramp: Copper's voice pattern is easy to hear too
[1:56:05] doc_sharon: yeah that is known Copper lore
[1:56:18] doc_sharon: yep
[1:56:22] ArlenArmageddon: Wasn't copper the one that said how many people Norman killed?
[1:56:27] Kthanid: AFAIK, ONLY Collin and Andi have made deals that don't directly involve taking the life of someone.
[1:56:35] doc_sharon: those are dots that Nancy could easily connect
[1:56:43] rachelkachel: katesJuice
[1:56:46] oskarbaby: its pretty easy to figure out who each person is

[1:59:13] Insaif: @skytramp CM has been known to at least show deference to Norman.
[2:00:03] Nightbot: Please don't share information that the character doesn't know in chat. It's more fun for everyone if she discovers things for herself, and makes for amazing moments. Thanks! katesLove
[2:00:11] AshuraX13: We know its recent. Norman said all this happened 4 years ago
[2:00:13] doc_sharon: not with that attitude, Flop
[2:00:31] Tresko87: its RP, if you believe hard enough you can be a flower
[2:00:33] skytramp: he was a psychotic serial killer
[2:00:41] Crafty_Crystal: Because he was mentally ill and kidding himself. Didn’t he basically say that to Nancy?
[2:00:46] laxwall11: If Norman shows up does that count as an uninvited person showing up?
[2:00:51] Insaif: I got here late. Has Nancy said anything at all since they started?
[2:00:57] skytramp: many serial killers see themselves as deities
[2:00:57] ArlenArmageddon: No
[2:00:59] aideenx98: nopw

[2:12:03] Oozlav: @doc_sharon The problem is someone will try this, but accidentally make a deal with him instead and like a bad phishing scam, rope like 3 other people into 3 more stupid deals

[2:13:00] swimer44: I think it's her cop

[2:16:08] TastyKudzu: That actually makes sense. Lennon having a bird named Hope which is anti-Norman.
[2:16:14] JYNexia: katesGun come on someone shoot him
[2:16:32] doc_sharon: this is turning into BirdCon KEKW

[2:17:12] Kthanid: Kinda hard for pezzcrow to show up when Cody is here, sadly.
[2:17:19] if0rg0t2remember: @that_monkey Pezz plays that bird IIRC and he's on Cody/Pez at the moment

[2:18:08] that_monkey: Circles on circles of no one wanting to give anything
[2:18:23] kangg: They want to believe the white bird will stop Norman
[2:18:26] WackyTommyT: Do we know who is in the black outfit directly across from Nancy?
[2:18:30] TastyKudzu: Repeating and confirming things is worthwhile though because it provides a second source.
[2:18:35] skytramp: @WackyTommyT Winston

[2:43:26] skytramp: @shadow_walker_2 norman took him out

[2:43:41] ellawasadopted: KEKW
[2:43:44] Crafty_Crystal: Nancy doesn’t have a reason to save anyone. People die every day. Death isn’t shocking or tragic to her unless it’s a loved one

[2:44:11] orangey_rng: cmon, I just need someone to make a new deal

[2:44:14] hecktobreakfast: @TheeForsakenOne I have but I don't count. FeelsRainMan
[2:44:17] A_Humble_Wooper: @TheeForsakenOne if they have, we haven't heard it.
[2:44:17] doc_sharon: Nancy found Andi because she was not supposed to be there.  Dark is supposed to be there KEKW
[2:44:21] TastyKudzu: This looks like a cult ritual killing. Everyone going to go to interrogation.
[2:44:22] Paganmonk: id call that Death/norman showing what hes really capable of.

[2:45:46] fruzsi_na: Does Norman’s voice count as voice from purgatory in bingo?
[2:45:47] stevenernest1: the northern lights
[2:45:59] 9ulz_: Who there could have the answers tho
[2:46:00] A_Humble_Wooper: @fruzsi_na sure, since we didn't see him.
[2:46:07] Nightbot: If you have Amazon Prime you can subscribe via Twitch Prime, FOR FREE! See https://twitch.amazon.com/prime for more details.
[2:46:19] skytramp: yeah, he could have dropped everyone
[2:46:22] RawShark1024: there's cutting tension and there's being a fool
[2:46:23] Kthanid: Yeah, understandable.
[2:46:24] baron_von_meijin: dripped dark far away from the lighthouse too
[2:46:25] fruzsi_na: @darth_wooper ty
[2:46:36] lizardsnapper: @skytramp holy shit I didn’t even think of that
[2:46:38] LilMaGooby: Norman said that someone had the answer,  it has to be Nancy or Andi
[2:46:39] krex36: Collin loves to antagonize Norman
[2:46:42] doc_sharon: katesPlot katesPlot katesPlot
[2:46:50] CAYKE__: he just proved a point
[2:46:58] A_Humble_Wooper: Probably really high.
[2:47:03] skytramp: @LilMaGooby I think Norman was lying to make people distrust each other

[2:47:30] doc_sharon: so there's some answers for the group KEKW
[2:47:42] krex36: Norman has dropped people many places before. including the billy
[2:47:54] heykorr: so that was rhodes that dropped?
[2:47:59] hecktobreakfast: THANK YOU ANDY
[2:48:01] hecktobreakfast: ANDI
[2:48:03] skytramp: Dark, Rhodes isn't present
[2:48:03] Lilliphus: @heykorr dark
[2:48:03] Crazith: I do agree that the main focal point is Andi and Nancy
[2:48:08] Twaintoss: "One of you has the answer; and either is unwilling to tell, or unbeknown to them" ---> It's NOT Cody that knows, cause he already left, and nobody knows more than Andi and Nancy.
[2:48:09] doc_sharon: people can fuck around, but leave us out of it KEKW
[2:48:09] vvatervvitch: ahahah
[2:48:12] GenuineMind: LOL

[2:50:06] lorddracnor: Damn, I missed Norman?
[2:50:18] skytramp: @lorddracnor just his voice
[2:50:21] A_Humble_Wooper: @lorddracnor a bunch of fog, and his voice.
[2:50:34] VTMonster: It's neat how you can tell who is who by speech patterns
[2:50:34] ArlenArmageddon: I wasn't speaking, says the guy who spoke a lot katesLol

[2:50:56] oneandonlyTJx: The other part was Collin just hates sitting quietly KEKW
[2:50:59] LilMaGooby: I don't think anyone had any meaningful info aside from Bryce and Andi
[2:51:15] Beertrain2k: I hear not-snackies !
[2:51:17] skytramp: And not kill, she said trap
[2:51:24] luke_rp_: 5Head
[2:51:36] lizardsnapper: Not to be that guy… Ads pepeHands
[2:51:40] doc_sharon: trap might just piss him off more
[2:52:02] lizardsnapper: As in that’s what bryce said then I got ads it looks shitty out of context AAAA
[2:52:08] skytramp: Cass has her own knowledge, but who knows if its accurate for this situation
[2:52:27] luke_rp_: Kate can we get this emote katesShy https://betterttv.com/emotes/5d6096974932b21d9c332904
[2:52:50] that_monkey: Wait if dark dies doesn’t that mean Ed has Roads to Himself??
[2:52:52] Crafty_Crystal: That can trap him but poor Cas is probably wrong since Norman himself said the person who knows has not said

[2:53:41] Crafty_Crystal: katesLol
[2:53:50] RawShark1024: famous Bostonian, Richard Dark katesLol
[2:53:50] BarrelGal: It makes sense that Nancy wants Collin close after some dropped.

[2:54:17] laxwall11: What if Dark did? oops
[2:54:17] l_meta: pahk thah cah in thah hahvahd yahd katesMega
[2:54:22] RawShark1024: but what's the question to the answer?
[2:54:30] doc_sharon: I think the answer is...don't make a deal in the first place
[2:54:43] AshuraX13: IF she does, she doesn't know it
[2:54:44] A_Humble_Wooper: If she has the answer, she doesn't realize she has it, I think.
[2:54:50] skytramp: i think norman's lying because the best way to mess with a group of people is say one of them is hiding something
[2:54:54] LilMaGooby: I think Nancy is part of the solution
[2:54:56] luke_rp_: We knew what would happen before lol
[2:54:57] Kthanid: Dark voided his deal by saying he wouldn't do it.
[2:55:02] VTMonster: you gotta fight Ziggy IRL katesLol
[2:55:11] Twaintoss: Nancy might HAVE the answer, but we definitely don't know about it. katesShrug
[2:55:20] Koufaxmoose32: HI KATE! Happy Hump day wednesday!
[2:55:21] luke_rp_: 5Head Just shoot Norman
[2:55:24] heykorr: did nancy ever tell anyone about how to kill norman
[2:55:27] Koufaxmoose32: CHat - hope youre having a great one!!
[2:55:30] Paganmonk: the deal involved all 3... killing 1 doesnt break a deal  chalupaMad
[2:55:32] jfreds807: katesNom katesNom
[2:55:33] heykorr: because he did tell her at the observatory
[2:55:40] heykorr: right when dundee died
[2:55:41] lorddracnor: Nancy knows the answer, it's don't make deals and don't fuck with him.
[2:55:49] if0rg0t2remember: who is that is pacing?
[2:56:03] arbucklezero: when Dundee died?
[2:56:05] Kthanid: The only information Nancy has on the transfer of "power" or killing death is Norman saying  "Death came for me and I came for death."
[2:56:18] TastyKudzu: Does Nancy want to kill Norman?
[2:56:25] if0rg0t2remember: no she does not
[2:56:38] heykorr: @Kthanid yeah and norman told her that he killed the last person who was death in purgatory and thats the only way that death can die
[2:56:38] skytramp: neither Andi nor Nancy wants to. Taking Norman out leaves space for something worse to take his place.
[2:56:39] Twaintoss: @TastyKudzu She very much does not.
[2:56:48] heykorr: @Kthanid and then that person becomes death
[2:56:56] doc_sharon: but Norman did not say how he killed death.
[2:56:58] heykorr: he literally told her this
[2:57:22] doc_sharon: it tells how he became death, but not how to kill him
[2:57:23] Kthanid: That's the result yeah, not the process.
[2:57:32] arbucklezero: so it has to happen in purgatory, but no idea what to do there
[2:57:34] KORPPIWORPPI: I love the accent Fey is using
[2:57:35] Koufaxmoose32: This is a sweet outfit you have on!
[2:57:42] skytramp: oh if its the answer to getting out of a deal that's Andi.
[2:57:42] abblepiewit: "Getting out of a deal" would imply Andi to me.
[2:57:43] ArlenArmageddon: He's also said that to multiple people, and here Norman said only one person knew the key
[2:57:44] doc_sharon: Hi @KORPPIWORPPI katesFlower katesFlower katesFlower
[2:57:46] heykorr: all i asked was if Nancy told anyone that
[2:57:52] KORPPIWORPPI: Heeey doc_sharon <3
[2:57:55] CAYKE__: hi korppi katesFlower
[2:57:56] if0rg0t2remember: several people know the answer on how to get out of deals
[2:57:59] nickyg_that_dude: I missed a lot, is Nancy in a cult now? Lol
[2:58:05] Crafty_Crystal: I think Nancy is a little indifferent and just likes the tea. Andi seems to talk to him the most and she doesn’t want him gone either
[2:58:08] doc_sharon: Hope you are feeling well @KORPPIWORPPI katesFlower katesLove
[2:58:08] CAYKE__: hope youre doing well katesFlower
[2:58:08] skytramp: !what
[2:58:08] Nightbot: This is the "Council of Bones" aka BoneCon! Nancy, Collin, and a lot of other disguised people are meeting to... share info about Norman, and hopefully come up with a plan to deal with him? Supposedly. katesJuice
[2:58:09] KORPPIWORPPI: CAYKE__ caiylaFlowerA
[2:58:10] Lulily: He has to die in purgatory, but we don't know if there's a specific thing or way he has to die
[2:58:17] laxwall11: I mean god fearing man there
[2:58:19] hecktobreakfast: pray norman away
[2:58:22] doc_sharon: that was a stretch for Collin
[2:58:27] doc_sharon: or maybe he was kidding
[2:58:29] KORPPIWORPPI: doc_sharon Appreciate you :3 I'm doing okiedokie
[2:58:30] HawkeyePierce: what about thoughts?
[2:58:31] The_Voices: says the man who thinks he might burst into flame if he goes into a church
[2:58:33] Paganmonk: payge the dead away. chalupaNODDERS
[2:58:38] baron_von_meijin: Nancy doesn't remember going into purgatory. Nancy has to learn how to control it so she can go in and out at free will to be able to kill Norman in purgatory
[2:58:42] skytramp: it also doesn't mean its true knowledge.
[2:58:50] Crafty_Crystal: It’s not an answer
[2:58:59] oskarbaby: just pray the death away 4 head
[2:58:59] Twaintoss: Yeah, we know the killing took place within Purgatory aka "death's domain" but we have no idea what exactly needs to happen, just that it probably has to happen in purgatory
[2:59:11] hecktobreakfast: But like, taking the job of death from Norman sounds like so much *work*. Ew.
[2:59:20] Crafty_Crystal: And it wasn’t how just where
[2:59:22] arbucklezero: we're just missing one extra sentence
[2:59:24] A_Humble_Wooper: And Norman didn't say HOW he killed the previous Death. He just said he killed them.
[2:59:38] JYNexia: Maybe he was referring to Andi because she figured out how he will let her out of the deal and stuff but its not a guarantee
[2:59:38] RawShark1024: hey! he's realizing his efforts are futile! that's growth
[2:59:45] Twaintoss: "Why did I even come" checks bingo card KEKW
[2:59:50] arbucklezero: "I killed death in purgatory by throwing it into Brick James"
[2:59:55] Koufaxmoose32: I love awkward things
[2:59:57] abblepiewit: I feel like Nancy and Andi got a little out of the meeting. The rest, maybe not. katesLol
[3:00:02] jfreds807: katesHypers katesHypers katesHypers katesHypers
[3:00:03] Nightbot: Please don't share information that the character doesn't know in chat. It's more fun for everyone if she discovers things for herself, and makes for amazing moments. Thanks! katesLove
[3:00:03] nickyg_that_dude: Is everyone here "dead"
[3:00:10] doc_sharon: peepoClap fun BoneCon, everyone /s
[3:00:10] lizardsnapper: Honestly not as many deaths as I was concerned about!
[3:00:14] Crafty_Crystal: He didn’t actually say he killed death. Just that he came for him
[3:00:17] HurricaneChapman: If nothing else, you all learned that going this far out of city does nothing to protect you.
[3:00:19] hecktobreakfast: peepoClap katesBusiness  good meeting, fam.
[3:00:24] JesTheRed: why is everyone so afraid to share informaton
[3:00:30] CAYKE__: Nancy learned some things, but very little, right?
[3:00:35] AnonymousTrace_: That meeting gave Norman a free kill KEKW
[3:00:42] skytramp: most of their "info" are personal weaknesses and secrets, why WOULD they share it?
[3:00:45] jedi_raccoon: True
[3:00:46] vvatervvitch: lmfao
[3:00:48] lorddracnor: People need to stop acting like Norman is a guy they can kill and start treating him like a force of nature.
[3:00:49] Stoffern: Learned about Hope and Lennon
[3:00:50] doc_sharon: yeah there was some good info from there.  Plus knowing who showed up was good
[3:00:50] if0rg0t2remember: Nancy learned about the white crow
[3:00:51] krex36: Nancy definitely learned things she didn't know about before
[3:00:52] slackerdee: well that's not exactly new
[3:00:53] Ererior: Who is fucking which idiot?
[3:00:53] Crafty_Crystal: Well she knew that
[3:00:54] arbucklezero: Was that a meeting that could have been an email?
[3:00:54] gingerbrettman: The people who could give the most insight and knowledge had no incentive to speak at this thing.
[3:00:54] JesTheRed: katesNotes  I think we knew that one
[3:00:55] CAYKE__: lol
[3:00:57] recklessgallifreyan: I thought she already knew that LUL
[3:01:08] jfreds807: katesNotes people are idiots
[3:01:11] Twaintoss: Well, we got some interesting new information. That being said, I am more confused now than before the meeting LUL
[3:01:12] RawShark1024: @Ererior Storm and Cody, each other
[3:01:22] doc_sharon: KEKW
[3:01:28] LilMaGooby: the white bird in conjunction with Nancy is my guess as to what the answer is

[3:02:35] Paganmonk: what if the person who knows how to get rid of Norman, has ZERO desire to get rid of him goldenlSip
[3:02:35] hecktobreakfast: if he is gonna insist on sharing literally every burp with the class, then he's gonna get burp ID'd.
[3:02:39] Beertrain2k: No voice changer can ever hide that burp or that scream....
[3:02:41] arbucklezero: so if Nancy doesn't know... who does?
[3:02:43] vvatervvitch: He just couldn't hold that burp in anymore. Tessa spooked it out him.
[3:02:51] that_monkey: Wait aren’t most of the people with deadlines Cops? As Finn would say “Phuck the dogs” let ‘em die
[3:02:56] Twaintoss: Tessa didn't say anything during this, and I have no idea why she even showed up to this... I second your concerns about Tessa
[3:02:59] gingerbrettman: everyone thought they could be smarter than him
[3:03:04] Kthanid: It really does feel like they're trying to solve a problem that isn't solvable just yet.
[3:03:07] Nightbot: Follow Kate on Instagram! instagram.com/katestarktv
[3:03:08] doc_sharon: also some people think they are smarter than they are katesPlot
[3:03:13] doc_sharon: katesLove katesLove katesLove
[3:03:19] hecktobreakfast: peepoClap  Notepads!
[3:03:22] MyNameisTiff_: katesLove katesHypers katesLove katesHypers
[3:03:25] HurricaneChapman: Even better, everyone goes in expecting everyone else to be an idiot and that they, themselves, are the one exception, and start pulling the finger pointing "you are all idiots" attitude NODDERS
[3:03:26] arbucklezero: so many deals!
[3:03:31] HawkeyePierce: that's a lot of deals
[3:03:33] Abadoss: Not so much Dark anymore.
[3:03:35] AshuraX13: No bingo for me katesCri So many marked squares
[3:03:37] Twaintoss: Lennon's Bird
[3:03:41] laxwall11: learned that we cant talk to Andi about the brother
[3:03:45] TastyKudzu: You learned who ADMITTED to having deals.
[3:03:51] IchibaToll: Assuming nobody held back...there could be more deals I guess.
[3:03:52] doc_sharon: true
[3:03:56] that_monkey: Isn’t Andy’s deal near finished
[3:03:59] Twaintoss: @laxwall11 true.
[3:04:12] arbucklezero: Is it an OOC can't talk to Andi or an IC?
[3:04:17] doc_sharon: we know he heard all that too KEKW
[3:04:20] krex36: he has a brother named Isaac that seems to be a sensitive subject for Norman kivaNotes
[3:04:25] abblepiewit: @arbucklezero IC
[3:04:33] A_Humble_Wooper: @that_monkey Nancy doesn't know what Andi's deal is, so she has no way of knowing if/when it'll be finished.
[3:04:41] Crafty_Crystal: That wasn’t much for Knight
[3:04:45] Crafty_Crystal: katesLol
[3:04:46] skytramp: and apparently incapable of taking Norman out himself
[3:04:59] A_Humble_Wooper: That's not news though.
[3:05:12] Carbonfated: @Darth_Wooper word
[3:05:12] Twaintoss: @that_monkey She extended the deal for now, because the wording of it also protects her Club. That is what Andi told us at least
[3:05:13] doc_sharon: Clap the devs
[3:05:15] LilMaGooby: storm was only there to pry for info
[3:05:18] A_Humble_Wooper: !devs
[3:05:18] Nightbot: The NoPixel devs are all absolute LEGENDS! katesHype WE LOVE THEM! katesLove Thank you so much for all you do for us. katesHug
[3:05:18] lizardsnapper: Clap
[3:05:18] gyldiir: PETTHEDEVS
[3:05:19] skytramp: Nancy knows Andi's deal with Norman is providing him something on a regular basis but Andi can't say what it is
[3:05:22] JYNexia: katesLove
[3:05:26] doc_sharon: that was INCREDIBLE and the setup was awesome!
[3:05:30] abblepiewit: !stan devs_and_Ziggy
[3:05:30] Nightbot: NODDERS In this chat we stan devs_and_Ziggy! NODDERS
[3:05:30] shadow_walker_2: Clap
[3:05:33] lorddracnor: @Darth_Wooper I thought they talked about it a couple of days ago?
[3:05:37] kangg: Nancy learned alot so mission accomplished katesHypers
[3:05:38] lorddracnor: on the beach
[3:05:39] Lea_NoAitch: Clap
[3:05:43] doc_sharon: katesLove Devs and Ziggy katesLove
[3:05:45] Carbonfated: and the fact it happend at night
[3:05:45] hecktobreakfast: @skytramp Okay but what if it was pizza...
[3:05:47] RodaLaxen: what about Tessa being there
[3:05:49] HurricaneChapman: I'm wondering if Pezz literally left so that he could run that
[3:05:51] MyNameisTiff_: You totally called it would happen at nightfall.
[3:05:55] doc_sharon: Honestly, that was fun!
[3:06:02] Crafty_Crystal: Cody with the biggest throw by insulting everyone
[3:06:03] f1r3al: That felt like Strahd's dinner party
[3:06:04] skytramp: @hecktobreakfast imagine, she goes to him like "what if, you spare the HOA and I bring you weekly pizza"
[3:06:13] ArlenArmageddon: @hurricanechapman Pezz isn't a dev or admin
[3:06:19] hecktobreakfast: @HurricaneChapman Pezz had to step down from being a dev to focus on family stuff.
[3:06:20] Siirika: Anyone Nancy is planning to talk to after all this?
[3:06:24] re_flect_ion: pezz isn't an admin any more
[3:06:25] hecktobreakfast: Er... admin.
[3:06:29] doc_sharon: katesHypers katesHypers katesHypers
[3:06:36] hecktobreakfast: katesNo katesNo katesNo
[3:06:37] HurricaneChapman: Ohhhhh I didn't know Pezz stepped down
[3:06:46] doc_sharon: That was worth it!  I would totally get merch from that katesLol katesHypers
[3:07:03] CAYKE__: Definitely a content server YEP
[3:07:04] HurricaneChapman: No more Yeti attacks I guess
[3:07:08] lizardsnapper: I thoroughly enjoyed bone con would go to bone con 23
[3:07:35] Floxxxie: 10/10. Would bone again.
[3:07:46] doc_sharon: also I think everyone did great with their outfits for BoneCon
[3:07:54] Carbonfated: *puts on tshirt* i got boned
[3:07:58] skytramp: except no-mask Ash
[3:08:00] IchibaToll: For sure, that was so great.
[3:08:01] ArlenArmageddon: Yeah that was great
[3:08:03] maka16: damn. I just missed it
[3:08:08] hecktobreakfast: It was very cool.
[3:08:12] AnonymousTrace_: I learned that Norman’s biggest strength is he specifically has a bunch of people who don’t like or wouldn’t trust each other so he just lets them do whatever.
[3:08:13] doc_sharon: agree
[3:08:18] abblepiewit: yup.
[3:08:21] hecktobreakfast: Fair.
[3:08:26] oskarbaby: where you able to id everyone
[3:08:32] RawShark1024: agree
[3:08:33] Natur3Gaming: Storm was on the phone the entire time too
[3:08:38] Kevsthabest: And we also know Cody and Storm don't have the answers, because norman only said the people at that table knew after he left
[3:08:47] BarrelGal: Well it certainly proved a lot of people have big mouths
[3:08:50] abblepiewit: Feels like Andi probably has the most information at this point. Like, actual information rather than rumor and gossip.
[3:08:53] GenuineMind: Cody just asking to be killed
[3:08:54] doc_sharon: someone had to be the villain at the meeting
[3:08:59] Koufaxmoose32: The outfits were awesome!
[3:09:06] Crafty_Crystal: Accused people of behaving in a way only he was
[3:09:07] lorddracnor: Jerk store called and it's all out of Cody
[3:09:13] oskarbaby: storm and cody got that main charecter syndrome bad
[3:09:26] skytramp: yeah, Pond held back and Cody didn't. It felt like she wanted to protect Lennon
[3:09:30] 9ulz_: Yeah andi has to be the one with the answers with all the questions shes asked but like she said, she doesnt care to put it together
[3:09:36] Abadoss: That seems like it will be a spicy convo between Cody and Pond later.
[3:09:38] CAYKE__: everyone was still VERY guarded
[3:09:38] A_Humble_Wooper: Yeah.
[3:09:42] grrlfriday: Cody took his ball and went home
[3:09:47] doc_sharon: Yeah major props to Pezz, Cody is a great character!
[3:09:54] arbucklezero: Cody is an absolute asshole. I want Pez back
[3:09:54] A_Humble_Wooper: Pezz is wonderful.
[3:09:56] CAYKE__: Cody is such the opposite of Pez
[3:10:01] Nightbot: If you have Amazon Prime you can subscribe via Twitch Prime, FOR FREE! See https://twitch.amazon.com/prime for more details.
[3:10:06] Ponscus: Pezz the human is awesome
[3:10:07] hecktobreakfast: DESKCHAN
[3:10:12] lizardsnapper: Miss the yeti days
[3:10:12] A_Humble_Wooper: Pezz katesLove Cody katesSuffer
[3:10:13] laxwall11: Its like Molly
[3:10:14] JYNexia: Every one was very respectful of each others stories except Cody
[3:10:15] oskarbaby: its cleo all over again
[3:10:17] jfreds807: katesBlubbers katesBlubbers
[3:10:25] DxDamn: you love to hate him
[3:10:32] grrlfriday: really showing his RP range with Cody. it's impressive
[3:10:33] doc_sharon: One day we'll have a character we can RP with him on katesCopium
[3:10:35] Natur3Gaming: The two ppl who probably have the most info didn´t share like any at all tbh
[3:10:36] Twaintoss: Yeah, Cody behaves like the smartest person in the room, then asks so many questions that you just realize how little he actually knows.
[3:10:37] Abadoss: The Petty Yeti?
[3:10:40] freakishone: The contrast is palatable.
[3:10:46] doc_sharon: katesHypers katesHypers katesHypers
[3:10:49] hecktobreakfast: At least we have Pezz as a crow.
[3:10:53] doc_sharon: Juno is fun!
[3:10:55] Beertrain2k: Megaphone Pezz was one of the gretest bits ever...
[3:11:00] blacksmith1095: that is the sign of a good roll player is you hate the character but love the player
[3:11:07] Aarek: Pezz is mandem crow?
[3:11:10] Crafty_Crystal: Cody-pile of shit Pez-a shitter Pezz-awesome guy
[3:11:11] Kthanid: I feel like Nancy will have a good rapport with Juno and I could see Juno and Mars partnering up a bit.
[3:11:14] hecktobreakfast: @Aarek Yes.
[3:11:17] GrumpyPanduh: chip jimmy pez sbs in hayes back in the day katesBlubbers
[3:11:21] doc_sharon: I have faith that something will come about over time katesBless
[3:11:24] oskarbaby: pez coming back?
[3:11:26] iNeroy: Juno is very fun
[3:11:28] hecktobreakfast: katesBless
[3:11:28] Dongolev: veronica does need some friends
[3:11:30] FuzZeeMuzZee: This boat is so slow lmfao 🤣 forget
[3:11:31] 9ulz_: Pezz playing cody is the equivalent to joffrey in game of thrones lmao
[3:11:33] Rossetto777: you might have to play Mars to rp with pez again
[3:11:34] FuzZeeMuzZee: Lmfao*
[3:11:38] Renoxius: and i love that the moment CPD happened, Juno became super respectful and friendly to Nancy. its like the RP green light turned on
[3:11:41] doc_sharon: katesBlubbers Jimmy I miss him
[3:11:42] Koufaxmoose32: What do you think was Nancy's favorite part of the meeting?
[3:11:42] arbucklezero: maybe Cody/Pezz eventually reconcile the two halves?
[3:11:43] VTMonster: I miss Pez the wheelchair menace
[3:11:47] Oozlav: Need something to bond over.  Like Norman's grave
[3:11:49] gyldiir: i miss the Hayes Boys
[3:11:52] Kthanid: We know!
[3:11:56] xl3ahamutx: you will be able to in nopixel 4.0 🙂
[3:11:58] abblepiewit: you're good! katesLove katesJuice
[3:12:00] ArlenArmageddon: katesHug
[3:12:08] Kthanid: I think chat legit just enjoys cop RP and wants it.
[3:12:15] lizardsnapper: @vtmonster AAAA Pez going on the wheelchair blacklist
[3:12:16] iNeroy: I don't think that's possible as long Nancy is with Collin though
[3:12:20] A_Humble_Wooper: @xl3ahamutx that's still ages away, though.
[3:12:47] Siirika: @Kthanid I think you mean a blanket ''Kate RP" katesLove
[3:12:51] GrumpyPanduh: @doc_sharon katesBlubbers
[3:12:54] ArlenArmageddon: @ineroy What's not possible?
[3:12:57] 9ulz_: Well at least nancy got some info
[3:12:58] arbucklezero: Nancy doesn't want Norman dead though, right?
[3:12:58] Renoxius: @Siirika this
[3:13:05] gingerbrettman: would Nancy ever try to get into pezz's purgatory to talk to him?
[3:13:12] Nightbot: Use the link https://amzn.to/3Q8NOdW when buying things from Amazon if you'd like to help support me! I make a small commission from purchases made through that link. katesLove
[3:13:20] Kthanid: @Siirika Obvs, but I know seeing it through Kate's eyes has given me an appreciation for it that didn't exist before.
[3:13:24] l_meta: nescarGo
[3:13:38] iNeroy: @arlenarmageddon Nancy getting on good terms with Cody
[3:13:49] doc_sharon: yeah that might qualify as a "fuck around" KEKW
[3:13:55] lorddracnor: @kate Has Andi talked to Nancy about her deal?
[3:14:04] abblepiewit: @Kthanid yeah, I gained that appreciation watching Potato, then even more from Custard and Kate.
[3:14:06] Nightbot: Follow Kate on Instagram! instagram.com/katestarktv
[3:14:12] oskarbaby: has nancy ever tried to talk to someone in purgatory without going there?
[3:14:12] kx07stitch: This is a very quiet boat ride back
[3:14:21] jedi_raccoon: Well at least I was able to at least catch the end, the table looked cool at night katesLol
[3:14:32] IchibaToll: It's also clear now that there are at least some things Andi CANNOT talk about.
[3:14:37] skytramp: Andi's already told Nancy she gives Norman something she won't disclose.
[3:14:42] abblepiewit: and Collin
[3:14:47] Abadoss: And Tessa.
[3:14:49] Stoffern: and Tessa
[3:14:51] CAYKE__: everyone is trying to decompress too
[3:14:53] hecktobreakfast: And Not Tessa™
[3:14:55] abblepiewit: and Tessa yeah, and I wanna say I heard Ash but that may have been earlier.
[3:15:05] oskarbaby: wherther its due to norman or other factors
[3:15:13] kx07stitch: Would andi and Nancy have another talk at a later date?
[3:15:14] HurricaneChapman: Is Cody on the boat? LUL
[3:15:20] doc_sharon: Yeah and Nancy gets that too
[3:15:36] HurricaneChapman: Right, so.. how's he getting back IC? LUL
[3:15:37] jedi_raccoon: Did anyone know that they were sitting on Cerberus chairs katesLol
[3:15:38] AshuraX13: She also said it's not something that would hurt Nancy and she would be safe
[3:15:48] aideenx98: At least you kinda know what she can't talk about now
[3:15:48] lorddracnor: that Cody doesn't have the answer?
[3:15:51] doc_sharon: Would have been interesting to see Cody's reaction to what happened to Dark
[3:15:52] hecktobreakfast: Me too! I had "Cody is shot" and I needed it for bingo, dammit! DESKCHAN
[3:15:59] NeedMoreGilmorel: Did Norman show up?
[3:16:09] skytramp: @NeedMoreGilmorel his voice did
[3:16:14] hecktobreakfast: @NeedMoreGilmorel Not physically. But in spirit and deed.
[3:16:17] abblepiewit: Storm left with Cody, yeah? So she doesn't have the answer either.
[3:16:18] Kthanid: I think kinda like TJ, Cody has the "I'm the smartest person in the room flaw."
[3:16:19] grrlfriday: Storm?
[3:16:27] recklessgallifreyan: Technically Cody could have the answer but someone at the table definitely does
[3:16:28] VTMonster: But does anyone know the question?
[3:16:33] abblepiewit: ahh, OK.
[3:16:41] Koufaxmoose32: Nice little boat ride
[3:16:53] Renoxius: and i think the person that walked by y'all near the end was Fey
[3:17:02] Nightbot: Please don't share information that the character doesn't know in chat. It's more fun for everyone if she discovers things for herself, and makes for amazing moments. Thanks! katesLove
[3:17:18] ScutiFruti: Dark was still there, he droped when Norman stopped talking
[3:17:21] LukeVonBismarck: Yeah Ive been thinking about that the whole time
[3:17:26] abblepiewit: Perhaps TJ was only of the mind of being there if no other BBMC were, or something.
[3:17:29] Oozlav: Huge fan of all the tug boats recently.  I don't know why people suddenly started using them, but its a fun prop
[3:17:33] RawShark1024: maybe he just wanted to sponge info and figured Collin could just relay info?
[3:17:36] haleyyyp: I mean TJ is naturally secretive, makes sense why any hint of him at this where people talk is something he would actually hate.
[3:17:42] IchibaToll: It may be that TJ was intending to talk a bit, but knew with Collin there that he couldn't share because it could be seen at sharing gang secrets.
[3:17:52] ArlenArmageddon: Dark was there, Norman dropped him after
[3:17:55] LukeVonBismarck: I was like "Is TJ annoyed that Collin "Possibly" blew his cover?"
[3:18:00] RawShark1024: well.. Nancy could relay
[3:18:06] luke_rp_: Collin is not in a gang Ms. Drew he is in a Club katesSip
[3:18:10] ArlenArmageddon: Yeah
[3:18:13] verityskye: maybe tj didn't want collin knowing what he was going to reveal?
[3:18:19] clementinecake: Sorry I know this is off topic, but I know Colin is scared of Tessa, but Nancy likes Tessa right?
[3:18:48] krex36: or... maybe TJ only showed up to let Andi borrow the Tugboat
[3:18:50] arbucklezero: why is Collin afraid of Tessa?
[3:18:59] Koufaxmoose32: whipBongo whipBongo katesBonk katesBonk katesBonk hope youre doing well chat <3
[3:19:00] JesTheRed: @arbucklezero why is he afraid of her?
[3:19:07] lizardsnapper: I know it’s so much easier when you’re watching it on stream but watching Collin try to relay information is hilarious sometimes
[3:19:08] skytramp: She's spooky, that's Collin's only reason
[3:19:08] HurricaneChapman: Dark was there? But according to that one guy, Dark wasn't there. Over and over, in fact LUL
[3:19:22] melllydee: !what
[3:19:22] Nightbot: This is the "Council of Bones" aka BoneCon! Nancy, Collin, and a lot of other disguised people are meeting to... share info about Norman, and hopefully come up with a plan to deal with him? Supposedly. katesJuice
[3:19:31] hecktobreakfast: Wow. Collin. Safety first.
[3:19:48] JesTheRed: @skytramp heh oh Collin
[3:19:54] ArlenArmageddon: Yep
[3:20:04] Kthanid: easiest way to deal with Norman, don't make a deal.
[3:20:10] grrlfriday: interested to see if he brings up what she did say
[3:20:13] A_Humble_Wooper: The only real info she shared, was that he's not the only one who can get people out of purgatory.
[3:20:20] NeedMoreGilmorel: Can Nancy kill Norman?
[3:20:24] arbucklezero: taking Norman out potential just gives someone else the power, right?
[3:20:28] ArlenArmageddon: katesLol
[3:20:35] Aarek: that is some good spice
[3:20:39] aideenx98: And that's Nancy's thing too
[3:20:39] i_want_an_avacado: bazzSpice
[3:20:43] Twaintoss: @NeedMoreGilmorel possibly. But it doesn't really matter to her
[3:20:50] hecktobreakfast: @JesTheRed If I understand it correctly, he thinks she's spooky and he blames her for the yeti attacking them several months ago.
[3:20:50] Crafty_Crystal: I want clips of people talking as she walk away
[3:20:53] lizardsnapper: If anything that’s beneficial to Norman right? Means they don’t have to go after him?
[3:21:03] CAYKE__: that felt like Nancy was frustrated with the tables stupidity and gave them a tiiiiny bit of info
[3:21:09] The_Lesser_Gatsby: The invitation did say no bird allowed
[3:21:11] Crazith: it is strange how everybody forgets Nancy is wrapped into this arc
[3:21:13] hecktobreakfast: Maybe the crows were looking for a New World?
[3:21:15] lorddracnor: Tessa is like a Grasshopper Mouse, tiny, but feeds on spiders and snakes.
[3:21:15] arbucklezero: It was BoneCon, not CrowCon
[3:21:17] blacksmith1095: I honestly don't think Norman can hurt Nancy but can hurt the ones she loves
[3:21:19] who_chang_records: !uptime
[3:21:19] Nightbot: Stream uptime: 3 hours 21 minutes 25 seconds
[3:21:33] grrlfriday: I was sure as soon as Cody dipped a crow would appear, but alas not
[3:21:34] Renoxius: its always annoying to me that people are like: "We're here to discuss a god of death." but then are sceptical about other supernatural stuff
[3:21:37] AshuraX13: Andi did say she saw Ghost. But I would have loved for all the ones Norman has to appear
[3:21:39] Xed_Regulus: How did everyone get invites to BoneCon?
[3:21:41] Koufaxmoose32: Amazing balance
[3:21:58] Cojatronic: Birds?
[3:22:00] HurricaneChapman: I'm just imagining one person on the boat looking very disappointed because they completely misinterpreted what BoneCon was going to be about.
[3:22:01] Xed_Regulus: Ah, okay
[3:22:03] skytramp: Dark mostly was inviting people, he had Andi help, Andi had nancy help
[3:22:05] xl3ahamutx: this subtle music is giving me raft vibes
[3:22:08] Koufaxmoose32: Danggggg that's sweet lookin!
[3:22:19] grrlfriday: I was super surprised neither of them was there
[3:22:26] arbucklezero: did they not get the invite?
[3:22:28] 2Flower: "Get ready to bone down" might've lured them in
[3:22:29] xX_Before_The_Dawn_Xx: probably OOC too early
[3:22:31] IchibaToll: They may have had OOC conflicts or something.  I don't think Bundy usually starts streaming as early as this.
[3:22:33] LilMaGooby: I feel like they want nothing to do with what Cody and Storm are dragging people into
[3:22:33] skytramp: Andi gave Lennon an invite last night
[3:22:37] abblepiewit: @arbucklezero they did. Nancy gave Lennon one for sure.
[3:22:38] moose311: how much of that is OOC stuff though?  Neither of them usually stream this early
[3:22:44] Abadoss: @skytramp Nancy did.
[3:22:50] ArlenArmageddon: Nancy gave Lennon the invite
[3:22:52] Elzcea: Might have just been a timing thing
[3:22:56] luke_rp_: Maybe they don't want to deal with Norman anymore after Cleo katesShrug
[3:22:58] skytramp: @Abadoss literally what i said lmao
[3:23:04] skytramp: oh i typoed yest
[3:23:08] Nightbot: Follow Kate on Instagram! instagram.com/katestarktv
[3:23:14] orant1335: I'm still curious about "the powers" Norman told Nancy they wouldn't like her bringing people back
[3:23:17] Crafty_Crystal: Did Nancy ID all the women there?
[3:23:23] lorddracnor: I don't think they want anything to do with Norman anymore.  They already lost their whole family because of this stuff.
[3:23:30] abblepiewit: Nancy ID'd pretty much everyone there @Crafty_Crystal
[3:23:33] MahshieMayhem: will Nancy ask Norman about anything that was brought up during the meeting?
[3:23:59] lorddracnor: can mods delete what I just posted, it's a little metay
[3:23:59] LilMaGooby: Ash?
[3:24:02] ijustwanttosellout: Ash
[3:24:20] ijustwanttosellout: But Ash was pretty to ID considering she wasn't disguised katesLol
[3:24:21] Abadoss: Balto
[3:24:26] LilMaGooby: after dark was flop
[3:24:33] Tinostar11: im pressed you can voice id so many of these folks
[3:24:37] MarinoV1: Forcer's voice is unmistakeable pooLul

[3:32:35] IchibaToll: It may be there's some understandable explanation that we just don't know, but as of now, we're only left with questions.
[3:32:36] arbucklezero: was he also in disguise? disguise not really necessary if you're just giving keys
[3:32:43] Twaintoss: Yeah, he wouldn't have disguised in the first place if he didn't intend to take part
[3:32:48] Kthanid: @krex36 they're also acting on the information in character and not jumping to the meta answer of  "Person needed a boat for RP"
[3:32:51] grrlfriday: and Andi has her own boat, she wouldn't need TJs

[3:50:11] picklewich69: this reminds of the aircraft carrier day during Denzel's mayoral campign
[3:50:21] Skarra365: NASDAQ and other stock groups like that are a bunch of different stocks traded together, and you make or loose based on the average. OR something to that effect, I've never looked it up specifically.

[3:52:17] A_Humble_Wooper: Quite chuffed, even.
[3:52:22] IchibaToll: Andi is very smart.  If people did clock that it was Nancy, her having dropped the fact that Norman's not the only one who can get people out of purgatory is probably highly of interest.
[3:52:30] Aarek: NASDAQ is also a composite index  that can be used to measure general performance

[3:53:52] Lulily: katesSip
[3:53:56] coherentdreams: more sepcificly NASDAQ is a "newer" stock index that often has newer or techy companies in it, wheres as other indecies are composed of older or "blue chip" stocks, Like NASDAQ, so the rookie draft pick as opposed to the old-timers maybe. In theory higher risk/higher reward to a degree.
[3:54:13] coherentdreams: ^NYSE
