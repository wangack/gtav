[2:04:55] mattthetrucker95: your just too good for him
[2:05:59] MadChemistTHC: with your own printer?
[2:06:31] mattthetrucker95: my neighbor is the son of thr ceo of swift trucking and hes super into 3d printing
[2:07:03] CensoredTH0ughTs: chat gpt, might be a good place to start, give it some parameters of what youre working with and it will guide you, learned a computer language (half-assed) using chat gpt
[2:07:14] johnny_jayy14: YEEEAAAHHH travpiDhead
[2:07:49] MadChemistTHC: i just know theirs people you can send the file to and they will print it for you
[2:08:16] FatBored: I used CURA before I got my BAMBU printer if you're talking about a slicing program
[2:08:35] mattthetrucker95: i could ask him for tips and shat not on software when i gry home
[2:08:55] FatBored: Not that I know of
[2:09:06] FatBored: everyone uses either CURA or prusaslicer basically
[2:09:20] FatBored: unless you have a specific printer that works well with a specific software
[2:09:21] MistaJingles: i got a solidworks certification in high school and that shit take s some time to learn as far as designing things
[2:09:31] EnigmaQuip: 3d modeling software? because 3d printing software is just a slicer that converts a 3d image into machine code
[2:09:45] FatBored: Yeah if you're talking about 3D modelling that's different
[2:09:55] FatBored: I use blender
[2:09:58] EnigmaQuip: fusion 360 and blender
[2:10:05] EnigmaQuip: adobe does have something though
[2:10:24] EnigmaQuip: Adobe Substance 3D
[2:10:34] FatBored: Blender is more for modeling by eye i would say, and cad focused stuff is more for engineering
[2:11:13] CensoredTH0ughTs: start simple, learn how it works, i use cad software for work and it took me only a couple days to pretty much fully master solid works and pro engineer
[2:11:38] FatBored: I always found fusion360 more difficult than blender but that's just me
[2:12:32] FatBored: also blender has a crazy amount of shit that is completely unnecessary to learn if you just want to make models and print them
[2:12:43] EnigmaQuip: never actually heard of anyone using it, but since you like the adobe ecosystem https://www.adobe.com/products/substance3d-modeler.html
[2:12:51] CensoredTH0ughTs: i was gonna say seems overkill @FatBored
[2:13:12] FatBored: @CensoredTH0ughTs yeah but if you just use it for modeling it's pretty simple
[2:13:18] FatBored: 3D rendering is an entirely different discipline than 3D modeling
[2:13:57] CensoredTH0ughTs: im of the mindset stick to software that does one job extremely well instead of a bunch of stuff mediocre
[2:14:40] FatBored: It really just depends on what you want to make, because if you want to hand sculpt something in fusion360 have fun
[2:14:44] CensoredTH0ughTs: although, i know blender is very good @FatBored
[2:14:51] MadChemistTHC: those tablets are cool
[2:15:33] FatBored: if you want to make gearboxes and shit yeah CAD is great

[2:17:24] NemisizZ: those are easy to make
[2:17:24] MadChemistTHC: you could also carve them from balsa wood, and make molds
[2:17:34] NemisizZ: both model and mold
[2:17:56] hauki78: check out epic bait molds
[2:18:24] FatBored: Yeah what you're describing is exactly what I do for my small business lol, only we do keycaps instead of bait
[2:18:25] hauki78: nice
[2:18:31] NemisizZ: get blender, and start doing tutorials
[2:18:51] NemisizZ: i wouldnt even use a cad for this, since the measurements doesnt need to be super accurate
[2:19:11] NemisizZ: you should also think about what you wanna print, as in type of filament
[2:19:13] FatBored: there's actually a lot of bait files on thingiverse
[2:19:28] NemisizZ: both free
[2:19:31] CensoredTH0ughTs: https://youtu.be/Co3SlgpUz5o
[2:19:31] FatBored: you could work from there
[2:21:07] mattthetrucker95: going for meta you got a phone call
[2:21:07] CensoredTH0ughTs: @travpiper there's a video showing you how to make it in fusion360.
[2:22:44] NemisizZ: in regards to a 3d printer, def think about what types of materials u gonna be printing in, and if you need a printer thats enclosed or if that doesnt matter, one thing is sure if you wanna print something like TPU, u would need a filament dryer since its super hydrophobic
[2:23:07] FatBored: @NemisizZ if he's just printing masters i don't think it matters much
[2:23:37] FatBored: But with TPU you could actually print the bait that might be cool
[2:23:41] NemisizZ: def would matter, some materials warp if its not being printed under the right environment
[2:24:04] hauki78: you can always carve one and then mold it
[2:24:11] NemisizZ: most printers can do that
[2:24:20] hauki78: sweet
[2:24:28] Plosion_: Wow thats cool
[2:24:34] FatBored: @NemisizZ PLA won't warp unless you do something wrong
[2:24:46] NemisizZ: yeah but pla is also brittle and hard
[2:24:53] FatBored: For masters, it isn't an issue.
[2:25:02] CensoredTH0ughTs: piper baits on the market soon
[2:25:05] MadChemistTHC: you can use a putty or balsa wood
[2:25:20] FatBored: yeah platinum cure silicone is a bitch you gotta be careful with that
[2:25:21] NemisizZ: master baits by trav piper Kappa
[2:27:00] NemisizZ: pvc
[2:27:20] NemisizZ: def wear gloves and mask when u work with that lol
[2:27:32] CensoredTH0ughTs: when you design molds you have to keep in mind that nothing can overlap, otherwisegetting it out of the mold can be a pain
[2:27:54] NemisizZ: lol
[2:28:09] FatBored: jesus lmao
[2:28:24] NemisizZ: a lot of those soft plastics isnt exactly healthy
[2:28:28] FatBored: I don't fuck with injection molding, just casting with epoxy/silicone
[2:29:13] slorebear: welcome back buttnerds.
[2:29:51] NemisizZ: if ur doing injection u might wanna get some support for the molds if its in silicone
[2:29:59] vewybig: Ming has to restart to see rep move
[2:30:14] slorebear: could be a ui r thing or some shit
[2:30:16] NemisizZ: like something you can put the mold into so its kept in place and wont warp
[2:30:24] FatBored: @NemisizZ yeah most of the time people don't use silicone but maybe if you had a hard enough silicone it would be ok
[2:30:43] Nightbot: stay up to date on shit - twitter.com/travpiper | instagram.com/travpiper

[2:31:36] Nightbot: check out my merch at https://dotexe.com/collections/travpiper
[2:31:38] FatBored: You could probably get some of the extra hard shit, like car tire hardness and it would probably hold up
[2:31:53] NemisizZ: yeah
[2:32:05] NemisizZ: altho silicone molds is known for breaking down over time
[2:32:12] NemisizZ: especially if its something thats hot
[2:32:35] FatBored: Yeah probably why people get the molds cnc'd
[2:32:50] NemisizZ: but they do tend to get brittle and start to crumple and fall apart if its something thats used a lot
[2:33:17] NemisizZ: but u should be able to make like 50-100 casts pr id say before you gonna see wear
[2:33:31] NemisizZ: maybe even more if the shape isnt that complicated
[2:33:58] NemisizZ: yeah 100% test first, and do it in cheap materials
[2:34:00] FatBored: yeah once you get comfortable with your designs you get the molds cnc'd out of metal for sure
[2:34:12] NemisizZ: u also learn a lot with the process by doing that
[2:34:12] Nightbot: IMGONNACUM
[2:34:32] NemisizZ: PCBWAY, they got a service like that
[2:34:42] NemisizZ: yeah its just to finetune the model
[2:34:46] NemisizZ: rnd basically
[2:34:49] BallForceOne: Are you trying to market this or is it personal?
[2:34:59] CensoredTH0ughTs: cnc for that is going to need multi axes, might be pricy
[2:35:27] NemisizZ: depends, there is companies that specialize in doing prototypes
[2:35:30] T_R_i_X: anal probe?
[2:35:32] NemisizZ: which is fairly cheap
[2:35:44] FatBored: that's not too bad
[2:35:51] NemisizZ: thats not to bad
[2:36:04] MadChemistTHC: yea its not bad if it turns out how you want it
[2:36:06] T_R_i_X: thats not too bad, for an anal probe
[2:36:47] CensoredTH0ughTs: 200 dollars is like 5 hours workfor some of the machinists i work with, not including spindle time, thats a great deal
[2:37:02] NemisizZ: yeah just pay for the materials kinda thing
[2:39:05] NemisizZ: lol
[2:39:10] NemisizZ: welcome to my world
[2:39:25] NemisizZ: fckn meds doesnt even work on me ,-, so stopped with that
[2:40:31] FatBored: yeah that seems pretty cheap for something that complex
[2:40:31] NemisizZ: i wish i knew about the prices on pcbway, because they got all that shit to make that, even if you want an actual injection mold made in tool steel
[2:41:00] FatBored: short of just getting to know someone at a local machine shop lol
[2:42:19] shyguywy_2420: i was just at LAX. shit is a damn nightmare
[2:42:24] CensoredTH0ughTs: then you have setup for the machine, custom fixturing, materials, it adds up real fast
