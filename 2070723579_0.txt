[1:54:08] Thrath: I hope at least if there is any conversation between Ant and Flippy it doesn't have Siz attached to it because it just has a higher likely hood of rerunning the same thing again
[1:54:49] Thrath: Like amicable at most unless Flippy is wanting to bend over to fix things
[1:55:20] 420thMagicMan: things were never the same after that conflict, HOA never actually recovered and in many circles is still hated across the city
[1:56:34] Thrath: I don't think its even bad to have the caution Ant having caution with stuff has saved them much more than causing issues

[1:58:20] floralwaves: kivaLove
[1:58:55] Vizi797: There's nothing wrong with Andi's POV. The wipe at best resets really bad relationships back to zero kinda right. So trusting Flippy is effectively trusting a new person that you have no relationship at all with for Andi. Sorta maybe?

[1:59:57] 420thMagicMan: if Siz and Erin arenât around itâs not just Andi that hydra would fuck over, they would fuck over all the other members too
[2:00:16] Thrath: I could be wrong on this but Siz is somewhat influenced by Erin on this and Erin is so out of the loop in this

[2:04:04] monstersbelow: I donât think bff gangs in current server meta is even a possibility
[2:04:40] Vizi797: I'm curious how there ended up being another dongle offer after the prison conversation. I kinda thought it was a definite no at the end of that convo with Flippy.

[2:15:20] honor234567: everyone would have went there seperate ways if not for you
[2:15:27] Thrath: Siz and Andi meeting again in 4.0 is what started it again
[2:15:37] Jerco2020: Am I crazy or is this like a new sani truck
[2:15:37] Exedos094: 0 chance HoA would last through 3.0 without you (imo)
[2:15:39] NoManners: the only the only reason the group got back together is cause you and siz started talking about it
[2:15:39] honor234567: yep
[2:15:51] Vizi797: yea, itâs kinda just the truth.  I donât think the reformation would have happened without Andi

[2:16:34] yungVDD: I always remember the conversation that Paddy had with Ant and said that when people think of HOA they don't just think "Siz" they think "Andi and Siz" I think Ant is definitely influential kivaCozy

[6:24:07] SadButRad1_: Ant and Micheal make their own group since they both feel the same way about their current groups
[6:25:29] zeman94: Would ant leave for a bit and hang with different people for a bit or would you make a new character?
[6:28:17] Sapphire_Tears: Ant deserves some rest

[6:32:38] Sapphire_Tears: some are working harder even outside their lanes and others using the stay in lane excuse and doing little to nothing
[6:33:48] DJ_4point0: It's weird because they made the mechanics to encourage collaboration, but at the same time, people feel the need to be independent. Unsure what's causing the latter.
[6:35:45] Thrath: Think at least talking properly with Siz about everything could be good like all cards on the table to try and root out the problems
[6:36:10] Thrath: But as you said its more if Andi would want to waste the breath so to speak

[10:36:18] Suska90: Suska90 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 32 months!

[10:41:36] Thrath: I'm kinda curious though is the system setup then that each tier gives a different color but wasnt active yet so tier one is just random out of the selection
[10:42:41] Madam_Orange: just Prayge itâs rng based and not locked out of tier 1
[10:43:02] fundead121: I just don't know.... what this is supposed to solve. Especially with it happening now.
[10:44:23] Madam_Orange: yeah the people rushing it likely already have it so if it was changed to this itâs a little late
[10:44:51] Thrath: Yeah just wonder what causes the tier to go up

[10:45:49] lblvckmvgicl: kivaTired
