[2:23:12] JesseP98x: Benji 'You know what I mean' merch when? Susge
[2:23:12] JushinUchiha: I think the only extenuating circumstance is the current chaos. maybe once things settle and stuff has been established it will be ironed out
[2:23:12] Stevie123123: its like when your homie has to tie his shoe and you wait for him

[2:23:13] Homonoha: Meti0X7CB 28k
[2:23:13] Irradiated7: waiting makes no sense, it‚Äôs not just an In game thing, streamers want to get their content and it makes no sense to force others to wait for unknown amount of time

[2:24:29] DarkBloodRevival: @Lysium company needs to upgrade the comms
[2:24:30] Rafayv: Chat, where is RAY?
[2:24:31] auuunt: but also everyone has put in effort and FOMO will keep the group wanting to log on instead of playing the waiting game
[2:24:32] Homonoha: Meti0X7CB before the robbery tho it was 400, idk if its taken into consideration
