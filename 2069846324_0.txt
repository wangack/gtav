[6:13:58] boobaisgood: Water. Earth. Fire. Meat. Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only Benji, master of all four elements, could stop them. But when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years passed and my brother and I discovered Benji, a meat bender. And although his meat bending skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone. But I believe Benji can save the world.

Only Benji, master of all four elements, could stop them. But when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years passed and my brother and I discovered Benji, a meat bender. And although his meat bending skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone. But I believe Benji can save the world.

[7:15:09] KEZERZ: 1K BUTc gun BP
[7:15:09] giga_mex: How about a roulette system
[7:15:09] legendstc: like ebay
[7:15:10] xjaesix: bidding is better
[7:15:10] Tueur562: Honestly it should be groups opt in and then in can go to a random app, if you lose, you get a bonus for the next roll.
[7:15:10] Hezi9s: @Lysium 50 BUTC is too cheap for that job
[7:15:10] DemonDam: Bidding promotes people just grinding even harder to farm butcoin.
[7:15:11] DarkZizou: The devs realised they fucked it up so gave X, Mary and the Co. 3 links instead of 2
[7:15:12] miisuu9: yea
[7:15:13] hellenaq: Bidding and a mini game to unlock
[7:15:14] elviz_u: Just do it like laundry matt
[7:15:15] LoStupidoBannato: blind bidding

[7:15:23] yyonniepz: bids cost but just to bid
[7:15:23] NorthWestDork: there was bidding on the 3.0 boosts contracts
[7:15:23] SkarredBlue: and if you bid high on first, you cant buy all of them, bidding is the way
[7:15:24] Tueur562: Or Charge a ton of BUTC to deter
[7:15:24] Krakonator: also should be only one crate per HQ app
[7:15:25] Jenovaux: should be silent auction
[7:15:29] wavyykayyyy: ray didn‚Äôt understand the clip
[7:15:30] rodamaal: 1 opportunity per group
[7:15:30] samlecs: ya if u want more u gotta do more
[7:15:31] lifelinememes: it should be one per group per two weeks you get one you on cd
[7:15:33] itzyoumanz: or lottery, blind auction, so no
[7:15:33] luvnetorare: Hack race was pretty awesome
[7:15:33] Mubbsy: 2 gangs trying to outbid eachother in a war to get guns would be hilarious
[7:15:33] venusthepimp: TIE MING
[7:15:34] Prometheus_alGhul: yea true
[7:15:34] Daelaron86: what?
[7:15:34] phantomguyyy: it's not fair for everyone
[7:15:35] dubv_Baji: i think everyone buys its spins wheel and you only get one per week
[7:15:36] GotMilk30: Yeah but people will purposely over bid to screw other groups over, Then that would be a problem
[7:15:36] Eaddok: Yeah and you can't buy everything cos it cost too much
[7:15:36] DarkZizou: Civvie gun licenses are coming out soon so 50 is a lot
[7:15:36] dobbersp: I think a lottery, and the losers get their btc refunded would be good
[7:15:36] owowowowen: Thai Ming
[7:15:36] thestreetsarewatchin: he watched the clip and still didn‚Äôt realize he could buy it he‚Äôs cooked
[7:15:37] Grioghar182: It like camping for a notorious monster in Final Fantasy 11 and knowing the timing, its such and old concept
[7:15:38] CreamIceCream414: mhm

[7:15:43] jimmy216: @lysium with a bidding system how much gun parts are really worth to people
[7:15:43] p0p19: ok but its wrong to knowingly doing it
[7:15:45] KunDares: it should be 300 BC
[7:15:46] mottarro: 50 but for 3 guns is way to cheeap
[7:15:46] alihaiy1: maybe add bidding system?
[7:15:52] erquilene: not timing.. it is the Ping issue.. you not gonna win over that
[7:15:52] yyonniepz: its beta testing
[7:15:57] arteezydoppelganger: cooked
[7:16:01] spunkydp: Bro yapping

[7:16:04] noctis_crescent: true
[7:16:04] jinhoo_gix: cooked
[7:16:04] leiru1234: @neroken231 I think this is what he did
[7:16:04] DOWNBAD_ELLY: Bidding would actually be 5Head so it motivates people to get more buttcoin and lose a bunch. It could be good
[7:16:06] iYeezuz: that clip is meta
[7:16:07] Night_Affinity: I like the GAMBA idea with a wheel that spins
[7:16:08] zodiaccmx: bidding only allows like 5 crews to horade tho
[7:16:11] submarinesix: What they can do is retract the progress and do another fresh round
[7:16:12] METAatemp: @mottarro not when a clip is 50 butC
[7:16:13] imacableguy: did he play breckers CG diss rap?
[7:16:14] hammamer: make it 300 for job will fix eveything
[7:16:14] rodamaal: It should be: if one crew already get in one contract, That's it
[7:16:14] Dirtyriver: @mottarro just for the parts way more for a complete gun
[7:16:15] mottarro: biding system or a hack to do
[7:16:15] p0p19: there is a rule against abusing a bug and they did it for their own gain its wrong
[7:16:19] gateloz: if there's a cooldown, you not being on the job is good no?
[7:16:19] zzjing: @erquilene what's their trick?
[7:16:19] ghostlikedevil: it‚Äôs abuse when they used it to get two contracts and trying to use zaceed to get another tho
[7:16:22] DarkZizou: It's 50 to get parts but 300 for bp 50 for ammo 50 for mag and extra attachments that's a lot
