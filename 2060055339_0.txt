[21:19:01] DabbyMcDabbers: Swan way tooo cool!
[21:19:14] Rahjoth: @luischeeks97 Haha! It's not even needing that much time for me, just the cost versus any time I would put into it. I think you have to support them to get your app considered. That's fine, but for the few hours here and there, not quite worth it for me. As much as the RP is solid...
[21:19:34] Rahjoth: @DabbyMcDabbers crystWave crystCool
[21:20:15] luischeeks97: @rahjoth yeah that’s kinda what I was aiming at as well, like if I’m putting this much $ to try to get in then I’d want to grind it to make it worth it
