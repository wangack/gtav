[5:21:54] NinJaHaK: put ‘‘em on a tshirt for my woesss
[5:22:02] sleeplesswolf94: @thedrakmer69 probably something devs are trying to figure out due to post they made about theft/robbery  of property keys and properties are not allowed until further notice
[5:22:02] DocRavage: having to hack the door if you aren't on the panel is pretty good
[5:22:07] emrejonson: so is breaking and entering allowed now?
[5:22:11] tommacca26: question is does the owner get notified
[5:22:17] x_Gordo: @raz_the_uber think the lockpick mechanic is so alarm doesnt sound when you have key

[5:23:28] Skrimzee__: do you have to have a key on you to be able to lockpick it?

[5:23:47] TheMonkSeal: he only does that to see the utilities
[5:23:47] Mordis_: He only removes them so he can see the power usage at the bottom
[5:23:49] x_Gordo: its because the list doesnt scroll
[5:23:50] sbit: K has to remove people because there is no scrolling on the interface, so he has to remove people to see utilities
[5:23:52] CasualStoner: Mr k has to do that only because of UI glitch, if you have too many you cant see utilities
[5:23:54] DESHAWNTE: @redskymaster true

[5:24:05] StreamElements: Make sure you are following the stream and have notifications on to know when Shotz goes live.
[5:24:18] outsideinsiders: k only has to remove people because of a UI bug that prevents him from being able to see the power metrics @shotz

[5:24:50] emrejonson: drop crowbar?
[5:24:51] CasualStoner: try without the key
[5:24:53] Skrimzee__: see if you can lockpick it without a key
[5:24:53] RycoFury: Best to make it a double door system now
[5:24:53] Bali_d: cant get easier than this KEKW
[5:24:55] Nzlaten: Drop the key and try?
[5:24:59] x_Gordo: seems that its there to disable alarm
[5:25:00] Itz_CIose: give the key to them and see if it lets you lock pick attempt?
[5:25:00] BiggJ317: Soooo does this mean house robberies are a thing now?
[5:25:00] 7thLettter: so it’s a lock pick for a key and no panel access
[5:25:06] DartTheBarefootDodo: Using a CC
[5:25:06] Splitcookie713: Lock picking with a knife
[5:25:10] bigbean24: you probably need the key

[5:26:29] Itz_CIose: you need the actual key on you to attempt the hack
[5:26:31] 7thLettter: it’s cause you had a key

[9:19:01] crazyredneck118538: @Shotz  where did the timer go
[9:19:20] azhobbit_: Don't do too much because you can't give away many keys
[9:19:20] liljayb_: Ello
[9:20:04] killogic916: can you put as many poeple on keypad as you want?
[9:20:09] killogic916: or is there a max
[9:20:31] Morfius53_: Don't think there's a max
[9:20:35] drabzzz: arrowhead its been 4 the shop a lot i think he deserve a invite too
[9:20:55] Morfius53_: But if you put too many, you can't see the utilities
[9:21:26] killogic916: With 20% down and 4 week payment you are looking at 57k a week (assuming 20% investor profit)
[9:21:33] killogic916: obv 1/2 that cost if its 8 weeks
[9:21:35] StreamElements: Make sure you don't miss updates about the stream, team, and much more! - https://twitter.com/TR_Shotz

[9:27:29] Nodontstop: with all those people rent should be fairly cheap
[9:27:37] killogic916: 8 weeks would be better for tax deductions (if that works), it would be around 28k a week ballpark (with 20% down).
