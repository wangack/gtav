[4:02:03] JoeayIV: i mean
[4:02:16] JoeayIV: you might have made that meeting easier already since Divine knew about Tessa supporting Max
[4:02:52] KingMcNastyy: Ive always wondered, does Tessa remember stabbing Max in the tunnel in 2.0? I know max obviously doesnt but not sure what happened to that through out the renditions

[4:07:19] nobodybodon: at your last location?
[4:07:31] nobodybodon: were you expecting something else? Hmmm
[4:08:50] jimothy64: @nobodybodon to be fair, some guy in ooc woke up in the sewers after crashing in the southside so..
[4:09:17] JoeayIV: can you give him platform shoes?
[4:09:21] JoeayIV: so he can kiss?

[4:11:23] JoeayIV: like a cartoon
[4:11:58] JoeayIV: more bushy
[4:13:58] thegrandgeneral3: Does crashing mean you need to put up the ad again or does it stay now in 4.0?
[4:14:11] JoeayIV: i think since shes backed up on ducks shes fine

[4:23:12] retrowolf0498: With money for prio
[4:24:53] Jen848: Juno comes up with weird issues
[4:25:19] rowbees: Even the smallest crack will eventually break a dam
[4:26:08] jimothy64: Juno been putting the entire family second to help Max.. not sure what he's worried about. But also it's Juno so solid chance she's making mountains from molehills
[4:26:40] IGWolfPack: I finally get to watch of stream of tessa!!!
[4:27:07] Mister_RebelHD: nakkiPopcorn
[4:27:14] thegrandgeneral3: Tessa did warn Juno of something like this at the start right?
[4:27:48] soiledmypantss: Tessa probably thinking this is classic repeat behavior
[4:27:50] soiledmypantss: lol
[4:29:58] JoeayIV: i mean, future mayor kind an important person to know
[4:30:04] KidAJoe: he wants to campaign
[4:30:33] afran25: @KidAJoe not really
[4:30:46] KidAJoe: well partially
[4:31:12] retrowolf0498: He's over thinking really badly
[4:31:23] jimothy64: People needs to meet him as individuals. He knows there's people with serious influence over his would-be chief of staff, of course he wants to understand those influences
[4:31:26] rowbees: He know that the family are a larger group of votes. He definitely want to introduce himself and get on their good side. Theres no malicious intent
[4:31:31] KidAJoe: obviously he wants to make this work too
[4:31:42] nobodybodon: I don't think he's necessarily wrong, Dab probably WOULD love to gather info on whos who in the familly
[4:32:00] Jen848: seems like the meeting with Vito would be sufficient
[4:32:15] SiIky_Smooth: Given tessa's history with him does she have a negative view of max?
[4:32:24] rowbees: But does Vito decide what everyone else in the family want?
[4:32:59] MrWaddlington: there is no friction, Vito said, angrily
[4:33:00] MajorPorky: so a group?
[4:33:00] MrWaddlington: Kappa
[4:33:05] thegrandgeneral3: Ah its a secrecy thing.
[4:33:50] sqqssq: cant anyone drive down to vespucci and accomplish that without a meeting
[4:34:48] Rhizwynd: Max wants to know what each person knows, not what the group wants. It is what seems to me

[4:35:43] KidAJoe: Vito seems to want to control that
[4:35:50] Jen848: that's what I was thinking @doeboy201

[4:36:28] doeboy201: @jen848 right lol
[4:36:34] SiIky_Smooth: sure people say its in the shadows or secret but at the end of the day the family does security together, trash together, events together. Like, its no secret who the group rolls with
[4:36:45] kelpklepto: guys i think we've entered one of those "circular arguments" where people keep saying the same things
[4:37:13] Jen848: atinyhLoopTalk
[4:37:57] jimothy64: I mean.. how was he supposed to win votes if he's not allowed to meet with them?
[4:38:08] JoeayIV: Tessa's translation service
[4:39:16] QuesoCommander: kinda sounds like he's not interested in having influence in the mayor's office
[4:39:25] JoeayIV: classic
[4:39:30] Macross916: Macross916 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 26 months! 
[4:40:15] jimothy64: Probably wants to know the interests of the group directly influencing his Chief of Staff
[4:42:05] thegrandgeneral3: Maybe Tessa should invite him to talk instead LO.
[4:42:42] MrWaddlington: nakkiWait
[4:43:41] JoeayIV: i wonder if Juno was like
[4:43:45] JoeayIV: mega cryptic about shit

[4:45:03] nobodybodon: KEKW
[4:48:03] JoeayIV: how bad would it be to crack open the tablet to start drawing
[4:48:41] JoeayIV: probably denied too hard OMEGALAUGHING
[4:49:36] joxthejoker: So max is worried that his right hand might have ulterior motives and might be using him, and now they have to convince him that's not true even though that's exactly what they are doing
[4:49:42] sauslol: I dont get why people think Max would accept Juno being part of a shadow group while being CoS.
[4:49:58] jimothy64: There's a reason why I'm panicking. That reason is that I'm Juno Sweeney and I'm returning to my default state.
[4:50:53] nobodybodon: @joxthejoker I mean, the ulterior motive isn't deceptive or harmful to max
[4:51:15] nobodybodon: she's not trying to use him, she's trying to make connections and work WITH him
[4:51:37] Jen848: dangit Juno, don't rule us out of the conversation. I'm selfish and want to hear it lol
[4:52:30] phattyd: were you the rat that was in burger king
