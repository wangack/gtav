[1:48:33] Ned15: Yeah what if that person comes in asks for PD gear because people have no idea
[1:49:05] Alekdk1: @buddha_hands i also normally watch Cheever when she plays normal Ruth and not Ruthless

[1:59:06] Baileybrad: maybe thew officers feel like they arent being listened to
[1:59:16] King_Rexy: @MSif7 ????? he didnt say he couldn't
[1:59:19] h8h8h8h8h8h8h8: but he's experiencing it, it's his perspective, they feel like Ruth is hunting them down w/ Denzel systematically

[2:00:11] Alekdk1: Did he just tell you to shut the fuck up Slacks. WAOW
[2:00:16] magnets_: Aziz is an amazing LEO but everytime he gets dragged into den's shit he turns into speculative nature
[2:00:29] ForgottenJones: what did i miss ? whats going on ?
[2:00:32] buddha_hands: @MSif7 it comes off like he's deflecting from his own actions lol at least that's how I'd take it as a superior

[2:01:26] magnets_: right it's the getting into the back of a truck without telling anyone
[2:01:28] buddha_hands: yeah none of this should've been a big deal if they just notified people what was happening
[2:01:28] magnets_: and having guns out

[2:02:02] chaosproductions: officers take on risk everyday. they should be trusted to assess the risk they are in
[2:02:03] 1CaptainRedBeard1: It's pretty bad when Cornwood also says they should have let people know. Kappa.
[2:02:16] Cyrical: that was great
[2:02:21] magnets_: yeah even cornwood told den he fucked up
[2:02:25] 1CaptainRedBeard1: BUT, 3 daps? 3 daps is rough for sure.
[2:02:25] Alekdk1: @forgottenjones okay you have a lot to catch up on I think artsii uploaded the clip in the discord
[2:02:46] h8h8h8h8h8h8h8: yes, they definitely fucked up on that – but getting that attitude from Ruth's senior is spiralling them into speculation on the pattern that repeats again and again
[2:02:50] 1CaptainRedBeard1: It feels like a warning/1 dap situation but a stern, "If you do that shit again, that's 3"
[2:03:08] Artsii1994: @alekdk1 dude im so behind on clips cause saabs been streaming for 15 hours a day my sleep schedule is messed up
[2:03:15] Krimson07_: GIGACHAD de rolo

[2:03:31] ForgottenJones: @alekdk1 thanks
[2:03:39] MSif7: she's created an atmosphere that is toxic
[2:03:46] 1CaptainRedBeard1: @buddha_hands Yeah, Rolo deserves some serious shit.
[2:03:50] lookingfornothinghere: i do udnerstand how ruth feels a bit since the cops she wants to punish are asking other cpts and it feels like she isnt trusted to handle it
[2:03:50] Alekdk1: @artsii1994 i thought I saw a clip from the situation that you uploaded. LMAO. You are doing gods work either way
[2:03:55] Krimson07_: veryFors
[2:03:59] foxylady48: 10 daps doesnt mean its over yet, let the RP play out
[2:04:00] totnumbb: Why put yourself in that situation
[2:04:09] h8h8h8h8h8h8h8: @MSif7 Slacks did not, but ultimately yes, for them it's an all out hunt for their badges
[2:04:19] ForgottenJones: I didn’t get a twitch alert saabHands
[2:04:28] h8h8h8h8h8h8h8: especially that convenient request of 3 DAPS when he's at 7

[2:05:21] Alekdk1: @king_rexy it could be worse
[2:05:32] King_Rexy: @Alekdk1 true LUL

[2:10:40] buddha_hands: it's true aziz doesn't seem to have a pattern of doing that, but if sonya has a pattern of doing stuff to HIM, he needs to be documenting+bringing it up when it happens right
[2:10:41] RonJon: i mean if he thinks he's right i wouldn't take this L either

[3:29:34] buddha_hands: that one is pretty bad OMEGALAUGHING
[3:29:38] TimmayHS: yea honestly I think this is a little unfair to Den in this case. Ruth has it out for his ass and he was trying his best
[3:29:43] fkingjagaloon: ooooo demotion

[3:31:02] TimmayHS: @lora1969 yea same, it's rough - the whole thing should be defined and Ruth should be clapped back at instead of Den getting clapped up for it
[3:31:06] ForgottenJones: only aziz
[3:31:15] devintalktech: @1CaptainRedBeard1, it'd be great RP, but I used to do union rep for people, and I woulda had a field day with things like this. I woulda chewed him after for doing it, but no show I would let him get daps for this
[3:31:22] TehDobster: I feel like the only thing that will be ran worse than the pd is a pd union...

[3:32:54] King_Rexy: !meta
[3:32:54] Ssaab: Please do not meta in chat, which means do not tell Saab stuff happening in RP that his character would otherwise not know.

[3:33:59] devintalktech: I will say the senior should be demoted based on her conduct, even in the heat of the moment. You can't tell subordinates to "fuck off" and "fuck all the way off" behind closed doors, let alone on a scene with other officers/bystanders

[3:35:53] devintalktech: He should get 1 for the lapse in judgement, aziz fucked up, 4 seems fair, but sonya needs at least 3 and a demotion. The seniors are supposed to set the example, and if that is the example the PD will be a mess
[3:35:59] ForgottenJones: until next week  den lol

[3:36:14] 1CaptainRedBeard1: Yeah, proving lies is pretty tough tbf.
[3:36:25] TimmayHS: i guess he could just do 1 shift a week until the daps fall off. That would be the safest way not to get fired at this point. Or only work when ruth isn't there
[3:36:29] ArdentCause: you have to set an example for officers and to be set at a higher standard

[3:49:34] Gnomeunknown: Denzel and aziz can never admit when they are wrong
[3:49:34] Snipe3pt0: gonna be rough how things go with the civies haha could be lies and cause so much more issues
[3:49:35] sendu6666: REAL true comes from body cam but you cannot use it ?
[3:49:35] ebos22: If Dean gets fired that would be messed up
[3:49:36] luxxen1: But someone could get fired before the truth comes out right?
[3:49:37] ArmyOfFutsak: it needs to come out quick if somebodies job is on the line
[3:49:37] Randog__: Aziz 3 , Derollo, 2 , Den 1
[3:49:37] OO7MI6: de rollo and ruth target people they dont like
[3:49:37] orgwhitewalk3r: the truth is pd is fucked right now, alot of  problems in it lol
[3:49:40] sonofdamien: Good RP but if people get in trouble from others lying its weird
[3:49:40] h8h8h8h8h8h8h8: Slacks was dropping bombs today – great RP saabSalute
[3:49:40] xHavOc19: this rp is great
[3:49:40] BobFromAccounts: 3 DAPS Aziz, send Denzel to academy, De Rolo 3 DAPS + temporary demotion

[3:49:42] marneraiders: oh oh
[3:49:42] aniquilattion: FIRE DEROLOOOO
[3:49:43] loudpack2311: also ruth needs to be punished
[3:49:43] captain_steve_420: DeRolo should be demoted for sure and Ruth needs to be put in place
[3:49:46] lora1969: !dickcam
[3:49:46] Ssaab: https://streamable.com/5qr16
[3:49:47] mutaint: send them all back to cadet and make bobby plembins chief of police
[3:49:48] TheTourist_: the t-Ruth will win, chat in shambles
[3:49:49] McMillvn: Also Den has a point thay he always gets daps without any guidance before hand
[3:49:49] BBAstronaut: the acceleration
[3:49:51] Adznkylie1: Ruth has it out for den and Turner and slacks cower to her has officers have been to speak to you about her and still nothing has been done
[3:49:51] npr3333: great show!
[3:49:51] neft39157: it's good story line for Ruth and Denzel's fear of her and daps stuff
[3:49:52] psylongti: Denzel vs Murder Cat death match to decide
[3:49:57] YaoHosen: reduce De Rollo to cadet for one week and have her ride with Denzel and Aziz Kappa
[3:49:58] arkkadon: @captain_steve_420 hard agree
[3:49:59] Kingbunsz: i think you guys need body cams
[3:50:00] throat_pump: I would say it all depends on how it’s being taken out of character. if Ruth is forcing Denzel in rp he doesn’t agree with, it can be bad. if they agree though, it’s good
[3:50:02] aniquilattion: @bobfromaccounts why would aziz get 3?
[3:50:03] JustinBinder: @Ssaab den left the door locked but open so the bug happens then
[3:50:03] lbowen7: Ruth abuse of power
[3:50:07] EmilTuT: it does feel like a movie tbh ahha
[3:50:08] iwannanuhh: I think giving daps to den over this will set a very bad precedent while moral is low and officers are already scared of doing their job
[3:50:08] eqnjn: DeRolo 'getting away with it' is gonna cost Den his job though.
[3:50:09] SkyMercury: Body cams solves all issues
[3:50:09] lighthawkd: 1 dap for den seems appropriate to me, i think it was a misunderstanding by the snr ofc
[3:50:09] lora1969: TheTourist_ KEKL
[3:50:09] RhalArda: if de rolo lied in her report about this, what else has she lied on?
[3:50:10] neckyourpint: denzel been violated multiple times for things others get away with tbf
[3:50:11] Chrisg2142: one bad apple in the higher chain of command
[3:50:11] Faildude: ruth report on what den said was messed up she made up stuff
[3:50:12] Caeros: "IF THERE'S A LIE IT'S BIGGER" that's what aziz was trying to tell you!
[3:50:12] gardangar: DeRolo should be demoted
[3:50:14] chaosproductions: RUth is Dap happy
[3:50:15] Kaztiell: @Kingbunsz then why even rp
[3:50:17] surelyURjokingMrFeynman: @Lorflin yeah that's my thing, it's good RP for De Rolo to lie but it would be nicer if the victim was more on board with it OOC
[3:50:17] neft39157: it's funny though how cornwood is working hard though for that sheriffs office
[3:50:18] 1Tesla1: cornwood has been testing turbos
[3:50:22] 406scott: would the dap be a reason to be demoted
[3:50:24] timedoggg: don't forget to talk to jason @Ssaab
[3:50:24] AndreSays: Don't forget Jason
[3:50:25] ShrewOfNietzsche: De Rolo has some anger issues along with Ruth.
[3:50:29] laaazylemon: as soon as you said "just wait, it gets better" and jason beeing awake this late. I know exactly whats up now, you sly dog :D
[3:50:30] lbowen7: Ruth dap happy
[3:50:31] Ssaab: Please do not meta in chat, which means do not tell Saab stuff happening in RP that his character would otherwise not know.
[3:50:34] ebos22: Ruth character is good for RP.....but RP can be toxic....and this is that
[3:50:35] ShinJiHun: !backseat
[3:50:35] Ssaab: Do not try to influence Saab's actions or direct him to do something.
[3:50:36] lelyk1: dean blasting sad music rn

[3:50:48] Eddie1225: lmao
[3:50:53] justind33: I think all 3 are wrong but Aziz and De Rolo more than Den but I feel Ruth is rushing it however its intresting how its panning out
[3:50:58] dakota22446: LULE
[3:50:58] MSif7: @Ssaab The whole thing is a hand grenade that could fuck shift 1 badly. Aziz stated he was done with Shift 1.
[3:50:59] Eddie1225: its not that hard to not meta and backseat
[3:51:01] Cyrical: if we talk about what we think he should do is that influincing him

[5:31:32] OO7MI6: saab10
[5:31:34] buddha_hands: it does seem kind of absurd if the guy is getting dapped for stating SOPs & trying to de-escalate lol
[5:31:35] dotslashdata: NODDERS
[5:31:36] BayAreaBuggyBoo: I think personal the senior officer is massively wrong for lying on the report

[11:38:22] 1galenhs: @Nitewinds Yeah, you are right, but at the same time, they believe what they are saying, like Slacks should at least know "matching energy" with crims is not what you do as a cop.

[11:38:40] Eddie1225: he can do what he wants

[11:41:45] Nitewinds: I think it's okay to want professionalism but it's also okay to realise that this is RP, it's not gonna be perfect and it shouldn't be because in the end it's entertainment so stay chill
[11:42:26] Eddie1225: once you learn about the Yes And? part of RP

[11:42:50] Rascal_PM: @rockshock portray is not the exact same, police in real life go through much vigorous training, resources, and years of exp. that’s like asking Saab to be an officer for 15 years irl to be a cpt in RP. mistakes are made in games, they can respawn
[11:42:56] 1galenhs: @Eddie1225 Saw right away that you probably found something I said to be disturbing to you or hit a point and now you needed to say something more and needed to bring out some power tools.
