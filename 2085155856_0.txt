[6:04:27] JadedHopeful: I have a question Nakkida, if Tessa sees Cornwood, would she jump him and kill him herself?
[6:06:54] el_gato_64: @Nakkida please come to SE michigan as tessa and quietly explain why responsible and non cruel hunting is for the best of the aminals
[6:09:03] RedBear_Beware: hi, Lily chatterboxWaving

[6:09:14] muzdiema: is she cramp or what
[6:09:19] retrowolf0498: For real @el_gato_64. The amount of times I've had an animal be suicidal while I'm driving is insane.
[6:09:21] WalaStika: lol why is tessa standing like that
[6:09:27] IosefSerov: Tessa is CROOKED
[6:09:33] WalaStika: does she have to poo?
[6:09:34] jimothy64: Injured @walastika
[6:09:43] WalaStika: KEKW
[6:10:11] retrowolf0498: She may or may not have faceplanted at the bottom of the stairs in their house earlier

[6:10:55] JoeayIV: years spent being crooked
[6:11:03] JadedHopeful: Nakkida, if Tessa sees Cornwood in the wild, would she jump him and kill him herself??
[6:11:04] rolldmg: Tessa is more injury than human these days
[6:11:49] JadedHopeful: Yeah that makes sense, won't be as badass
[6:12:01] WalaStika: D:
[6:12:08] sage40k: revenge is a dish best served with fries

[6:12:21] Brettley67: Geezus JAY!!
[6:12:34] geebs_wee: ... I'm so out of the loop, but why would Tessa do that? nakkiCB
[6:12:35] QuesoCommander: wait I've heard this solution before, you're supposed to go up to him and say "Go 42, pussy!" that'll get him off duty
[6:13:09] jimothy64: Honestly there's a non-zero chance K will still pull it off out of pure spite at this stage
[6:13:57] vipersummer: to be fair he caught two charges that shouldnt stack because of bad communication
[6:14:10] retrowolf0498: I have a feeling it was going to be a matter of time until he got that type of fine anyways.
[6:14:17] DJayEnzyme: the time and fine for the police robbery seems a little excessive
[6:14:39] davelecook: 156k $ fine hurt
[6:14:39] WalaStika: OMEGALUL
[6:14:45] smittyo0: If you got a hostage, maybe a cop, and told Cornwood to sign off duty and come alone or the hostage gets it?
[6:14:52] Brettley67: nakkiLaugh nakkiLaugh
[6:15:01] JadedHopeful: It definitely would be infinitely cooler if someone captures Cornwood and brings him to Tessa while she's sat on some sort of throne or chair 'I've been expecting you, Cornwood..'
[6:15:09] JoeayIV: days later she'll be paralyzed from the neck down
[6:15:27] vipersummer: he is going to get himself killed
[6:15:59] davelecook: say that to Tessa with 2 clowns in the room nakkiDerp
[6:16:00] JadedHopeful: she needs a cat to pet as she says it too
[6:16:05] jimothy64: Yeah I mean, per what limited information K shared, you might avoid the worst of the fines by just making an officer toss their weapons into the bushes or something.. its definitely still doable.
[6:16:06] vipersummer: if he had done or said that in front of Chatty nakkiNF
[6:16:50] davelecook: chatty might end up hearing it from those 2 clowns
[6:16:53] DJayEnzyme: @jimothy64 i would worry about a raid though if they dont find the weapons and know it was tessa as she planned to not be masked
[6:17:01] Chiracho: Jays daily shower
[6:17:16] Valcryst_: pogg his yearly shower
[6:18:02] nobodybodon: @DJayEnzyme I mean he'd tell them his weapons were tossed, if he's conscious and making a statement that it was tessa.
[6:18:08] jimothy64: @djayenzyme if officer testimony is enough to say a suspect robbed the officer, its enough to say they ordered the officer to toss it..  certainly wouldn't be enough for a raid
[6:18:42] nobodybodon: you'd be insane to sign off on a raid on a person you KNOW never had possession of the weapons KEKW
[6:18:43] StreamElements: Feel free to join my Discord flock, 5000 members and growing! https://discordapp.com/invite/nakkida
[6:19:02] OrestesTheSloth: If you then take it, yeah?
[6:19:18] jimothy64: I'd say no. But check the charge. It'd be like... extortion
[6:19:30] Valcryst_: make them drop it in their own vehicle? hmjj
[6:19:41] DJayEnzyme: i think you get the robbery charge if you do. but if you don't handle you wouldn't get the possession charge if you never touch the weapon
[6:19:48] rotten02: meeting number 21 hmjj
[6:19:49] rolldmg: I can answer that, but It's slight meta of what K did
[6:19:57] JadedHopeful: anyway I need to head to bed, I'm REALLY tired for some reason. I'll keep the stream playing because VIEWERSHIP. Night all!
[6:20:18] jimothy64: Also yeah, have them stick it in their car then it technically never leaves his possession
[6:20:21] JoeayIV: no no
[6:20:23] JoeayIV: that was bad
[6:20:28] davelecook: just give him a message

[7:13:16] QuesoCommander: it definitely ended the conversation, but really only because it made Dexx realized what the conclusion was going to be
[7:13:23] jimothy64: Literally exactly what Tessa has always had at her side.. Riley fits perfectly imo. The person who just cuts through the chaff and says what's on their mind
[7:14:17] vox_xxxx: My ass
