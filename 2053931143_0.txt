[0:11:21] NemisizZ: @dyll3 u can get sedans or something thats smaller, a suv just doesnt belong in a large city, its an offroad vehicle lol
[0:11:25] 9Rux: sup chat PotFriend
[0:11:28] Metric: that's the idea, they don't want people to have cars in the city
[0:11:31] JackLDN27: It's like £20 a day just to drive in central London, let alone parking

[0:11:57] Eku007: @NemisizZ Tell that to people with kids.. You know how much stuff you need all time
[0:12:09] RippoZero: I guess the fairness depends on how available public transport is
[0:12:14] rikzoo: AlienRave
[0:12:15] ky05uk3: Chicago is the Paris of USA for parking. An arm of the UAE owns the metered parking rights for Chicago for 75 years
[0:12:19] GCLladd: They introduced low emmision zones in my city recently ReallyReallyMad
[0:12:33] Metric: London for example has a huge tax for cars driving into the city becaause they want people to use public transport.
[0:12:35] gostonko: if you have a big family
[0:12:44] NemisizZ: @Eku007 sounds more like a luxury problem than a problem of being able to fit your kids into a sedan lol
[0:12:51] ro666ert: @NemisizZ maybe the government doesnt want more kids PepoThink

[0:22:02] Qu_ad: sounds like some ai generated school project
[0:22:06] Popovzky: feels like they account for things that increase happiness as a marker without actually measuring happiness itself?
[0:22:27] bonedead: just ask every citizen EZ
[0:22:34] dyll3: Happiness is perspective  no ?
[0:22:39] NemisizZ: social safety nets usually plays in a lot

[0:34:08] jay_jaymann: I’ve never felt unsafe just area’s that make you more aware of your surroundings
[0:34:12] CuppaTea: Good morning Nidas and chat. Hope everyone is having a great day!
[0:34:15] NemisizZ: apparently NY is taking a hard dip atm
[0:34:15] dyll3: I live in south Africa so I know  unsafe and US is not that bad
[0:34:18] GoutOfWar: nyc always feels like a police state, cops everywhere

[0:34:42] GCLladd: @rarigirlsick yeah its quite bad in the bigger cities here
[0:34:49] yourlocalstadtrat: @rikzoo shure lil bro, I once did a practical semester with the German Chamber of Foreign Trade in San Francisco and I got robbed on broad daylight.
[0:34:58] ProngsAedan: New York is scary at night too and they call it the city that never sleeps. it was hella dirtier too.
[0:35:04] NemisizZ: yeah same here in cph, but its not like im scared shitless to walk in those parts, but i would avoid them if i was a turist for sure
[0:35:18] rarigirlsick: @rarigirlsick cant believe people stilll using spice, i thought it would of been done with by now wtf

[0:35:52] Brodoswagings: yea but thats just your swedish instincts Kappa
[0:35:52] gostonko: trolls everywhere Saususge
[0:36:03] jay_jaymann: I’ve never had an issue in the unsafe areas because people know who are the targets and they won’t go after you if you look like you can look after yourself
[0:36:04] coolwhipice: Sup nidas
[0:36:06] NemisizZ: which part
[0:36:14] ThroxxRP: I agree about Copenhagen as a Dane. But really depends on where you are
[0:36:17] epic_smee: I never thought copenhagen was sketchy lol. But i am used to Berlin at night
[0:36:44] CuppaTea: Anytime people say they want to visit NY I usually tell them to avoid the city. Stay outside the city and take a train if you want to visit. NYC has gotten disgusting.
[0:36:47] rarigirlsick: i went trinidad last year which is now level 3 danger warning lol
[0:36:52] N0lan_playz: ive walked through Stockholm at 3 am and it seemed cool vibes
[0:36:56] yourlocalstadtrat: Rome is also kinda scary at night in some places. But its also because I am living in Munich and there its pretty damn safe, so most other cities are kinda a culture shock
[0:37:00] NemisizZ: theres a street right behind the central station where junkies and hookers and that shit hangs out a lot
[0:37:03] rikzoo: CuppaTea yep NODDERS
[0:37:10] Ruppster_: Almost as if you use taxes for the right reasons, bigger cities can be pretty nice
[0:37:39] epic_smee: @yourlocalstadtrat munich is basically dead at night. Let's be real lol. But safe

[0:42:24] Zardete: Should just buff civ jobs IRL
[0:42:25] skuts: The most cringe shit is the acid attack, just spraying innocent people who live in the wrong zipcode
[0:42:30] yourlocalstadtrat: the safest city in my opinion is Reykjavík

[0:43:06] rikzoo: Okayeg 👍
[0:43:12] Ruppster_: @Nidas  I wish most people outside the US understood just how easy it is for damn near anyonee to buy a gun...  People just selling each other guns... no paperwork... it's nuts
[0:43:16] ro666ert: mostly gang on gang
[0:43:17] tsebaka: They shoot alot but are not good at aiming!
[0:43:18] IKEA_DOG: PEPW It used to be low
[0:43:32] gostonko: ro666ert which gang r u in
[0:43:35] IKEA_DOG: Didn't we get dubbed the murder capital of europe for a bit or some shit like that
[0:43:54] ro666ert: @gostonko  drainGang
[0:44:02] gostonko: ro666ert nidasAha
[0:44:02] Xpatrol: Most western europe are at 1 / 2 homicide per 100k pop.
[0:44:08] GoutOfWar: annual homicides in stockholm is probably a really bad weekend in memphis or st louis
[0:44:10] Mavmar: murder capital goes hard
[0:44:14] ProngsAedan: 100%
[0:44:15] dyll3: Hmm
[0:44:18] SacredEel: we arent top 10 in eu
[0:44:28] ky05uk3: like to point at it ye
[0:44:29] CuppaTea: Just get yourself a dog. If someone came to my apartment with a pipe bomb my dog would just roll over begging for belly rubs. It would immediately stop them from using the bomb.
[0:44:31] IKEA_DOG: Not false
[0:44:31] gostonko: true story i was playing geoguesser and i thought i was 100% in a third world country. turns out it was berlin BebeLa
[0:44:31] rikzoo: YEP
[0:44:43] bluddee: All countries do that when their own county is criticised.
[0:44:45] scr4ppy__: "Hey, I guess they're not that great, we can rest easy" type of mentality
[0:44:58] Mavmar: tbh its like that with the US.... living here for the most part is fine but anything wrong gets put under a magnifying glass
[0:44:59] NemisizZ: they thrive for those AHA GOTCHA moments
[0:45:00] yourlocalstadtrat: Sweden has a homicide rate of 1.1 same as France, us has 6.4
[0:45:00] ky05uk3: the gotcha factor
[0:45:03] coca_clouds: its not just clickbait tho. you can watch the statitsics from before 2012
[0:45:03] Metric: I mean any opportunity to shit on other countries. Americans love talking about London and knife crime. Ignoring the gun crime at home.
[0:45:04] IKEA_DOG: Oh yeah I'm not saying sweden isn't safe
[0:45:07] yourlocalstadtrat: *US
[0:45:11] tarwe: In germany this situation has been used to push anti-immigrant/racist talking points rather than shitting on scandinavia
[0:45:17] dyll3: Yet ... MONKA
[0:45:18] skuts: Lizard journos trying to make a narrative is a gig as old as time
[0:45:24] Ruppster_: Yea... @yourlocalstadtrat  it be the wild west here sometimes :o
[0:45:27] gostonko: tarwe classic germans
[0:45:29] tarwe: "Look how bad it is in sweden" etc
[0:45:29] rikzoo: im not taking that murder rate bait
[0:45:33] ProngsAedan: crazy shit happens all over the world. it's more HUMANS thing than anything.
[0:45:42] smythdog1: like UK has a lower knife crime rate than the US
[0:45:44] IKEA_DOG: I still wouldn't go to tensta or rinkeby but I'd still call sweden very safe
[0:45:49] yourlocalstadtrat: @tarwe sure, and that's why we have a liberal, socialist green government KEKW
[0:46:13] scr4ppy__: It's like when a terrorism act happens in Europe and all Americans are like "When everyone has a gun, these terrorists can't run rampant like that."
[0:46:18] Madsouthafrican07: Bad news sells good.
[0:46:29] 1Bust: https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/murder-rate-by-country brazil must be crazy
[0:46:29] gostonko: COPIUM germanys goverment is socialist
[0:46:30] IKEA_DOG: We had a gang watch our football match during a tournament in tensta cuz one of the players in the other team was the little brother of the gangs leader
[0:46:36] GoutOfWar: rage bait
[0:46:40] bonedead: bad news sells
[0:46:41] dyll3: Not wrong
[0:46:46] MadeIine__: what's up nidas and chat
[0:46:46] ProngsAedan: these same mfers would call ny the best place to visit in the world....
[0:46:54] GCLladd: I dont watch the news anymore, I just get it from Nidas & chat
[0:46:56] Qu_ad: click farms Aware
[0:47:00] yourlocalstadtrat: @gostonko compared to the recent one, yes :D
[0:47:00] rikzoo: all news now is bad news
[0:47:02] gostonko: peepoHey @MadeIine__
[0:47:16] MadeIine__: peepoHey
[0:47:20] bonedead: also 24/7 news being normal is kinda fucked
[0:47:21] highrollergambler: information diet RalpherZ
[0:47:22] ObamaBinDroning: there is
[0:47:23] Ruppster_: Try and sit through 30 mins of Fox news in the US, and it's just sad... terrible things 90% of the time.   It's the worst
[0:47:24] sychotixx: Negativity drives engagement
[0:47:28] 1Bust: twitter is the worst for that
[0:47:28] scr4ppy__: it's so easy to be negative
[0:47:33] gu_bo: us humans werent made for this many inputs
[0:47:38] GoutOfWar: if it bleeds it leads
[0:47:41] tarwe: Its the 24/7 news cycle
[0:47:44] MadeIine__: it's not healthy at all

[0:48:01] GCLladd: Illuminati need to keep us controlled
[0:48:02] CuppaTea: I avoid watching the news. It is nothing but doomers on the news. I judge what I see and form my opinion on that
[0:48:03] ro666ert: top tip: if you're feeling down and sad watch crazy frog on youtube and you'll 100% feel better
[0:48:13] gostonko: ro666ert good advice
[0:48:15] jay_jaymann: it’s because news has become a profit based business and bad news sells
[0:48:29] NemisizZ: funny u say that, because thats how i feel a lot of people is outside scandinavia, like they try to find those gotcha moments
[0:48:36] smythdog1: that's true if I read UK news it's depressing but I'm doing good I don't want to worry about a dull future they're telling me I'm going to have

[0:50:48] IKEA_DOG: Yeah but then u realize it is pointless to try to prove how dumb someone is/was being
[0:50:49] numb3r13: das right
[0:50:54] skuts: Lowering yourself to someone elses reality is a Tier 8 thinkers take

For example if you're watching another stream at the same time and telling Nidas things that are actively happening on the other persons stream. Doing this will get you timed out or banned.
