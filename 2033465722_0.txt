[2:40:32] imSteffin: @AndreSays, no
[2:40:34] devintalktech: @EsfandTV, shes absolutely crushing this character, the power hungry angle is amazing imo, top tier RP
[2:40:36] 1CaptainRedBeard1: I'm going to bet it gets to Slacks and Turner anyways even if you day nothing. Denz was pretty shook
[2:40:40] 4150706925: Wiver pentawHappy
[2:40:41] DrShreyWay: what cruiser was the green blip on GPS

[2:40:42] azmer1987: Ruth can solo beat down entire snr buns. She is a bad ass
[2:40:45] Cthyllah: @catfish_quackenbush okay, well im now im trying to figure out why she wouldnt book someone for the 90 pounds of weed. like how does that fit in to her being power hungry if its not her being corrupt, ya know.
[2:40:45] AndreSays: @imSteffin ?
[2:40:45] KaneSmash: whats ruth's stream?
[2:40:46] devintalktech: @imationRip, yea
[2:40:46] Dagda45: She streams, but has been very sick recently (and has little kids running around)
[2:40:48] Capn_Stew: @Sweet_BabyJeebus Slacks was talking about wanting to hire some dispatch.
[2:40:52] jonfett: @AndreSays yeah, Ruth hates both Slacks and Turner. They're divided right now
[2:40:53] randybobndyphone: What's Ruth's stream
[2:40:53] the_black_hawk_34: bet she hates cornwood and andrews since she hates the old PD Susge

[2:41:06] Ragestrike: @esfandtv theres some good drama going on with slacks and turner vs ruth, i think it be best for the story to bring it to them
[2:41:07] Mac_Parts: Was she streaming during this? I would be interested to see her view during that.

[3:42:45] guilt_: To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand WeeWee. His communication style is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical RPer's head. There's also WeeWee's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance.
