Everything else since isn't something that's more than a misdemeanor charge. She only did actual stuff you can be charged criminally for (except that 1 time in 2.0) till after her 2nd mayoral term.

[8:15:08] TheRarePotato: I still don't get the weird gatekeeping
[8:15:20] MontyGue: I dont get it. Freddy likes to try for fun and the gatekeeping is for stupid cock measuring of who can do it first.
[8:15:21] Purplevivid: Its just how the city works chat
[8:15:22] moonnthelurker: its not about clearing it first its about doing it with the gang, doing it with the boissssss
