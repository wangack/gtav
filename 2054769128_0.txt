[1:42:49] ErraticSwami: @alvinug its tug of war. if one strain is at a 1000 bags they will be 100% and in order for new strains to get there they have to push equal amount. so eventually you can get 2 strains on 100 and 99 but only one will ever be 100

[1:56:10] eliteman56: @kalanw420  Speedy was doing the AC unit robbery. Got uncomfortable from the alarm and moved to another spot. Found an AC unit on the street/ground and deciced to get it but failing the puzzle square colored thingys. An NPC security guard pops up and hits Speedy while a cop pulls up and watches everything. Arush manages to juke the NPC and got into the car and drove away. The cop was probably confused as hell
