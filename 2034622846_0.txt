[1:18:54] CuBanMumzy: @Tubbins28 i agree with him too
[1:18:54] zrynnn: @big_hern139 2 captains wanted 60 days, 1 wanted 30, so the 60 is staying probably
[1:18:59] marneraiders: @goingafk0 Jaywalk should be a Capital

[1:21:24] octagonner: @RabzKC i will disappoint you rn, all 3 cpts will have issues about officers having secret meetings not cpt trying to find out what the meeting is about
[1:21:27] buddha_hands: OMEGALUL the cap'n lookin to do da dap'n

[1:21:40] UseTheForcePhasma: daps for all lololol jk

[1:22:41] xCheekz: Does the amount of time on duty reflect the amount of potential daps? It seems like the officers who are on duty the most will have more daps because they have more time on to make mistakes?

[1:25:37] brvtyy: lol she has officers snitching on other officers
[1:25:38] Jessc1996: I do think the suspensions etc should be hours worked not set time. criminals can bring their time down but officers can’t
[1:25:41] Ned15: I agree that not every detail
[1:25:47] scootypebbles92: I think officers should know they were suspended but not know the reason
[1:25:48] xypher85: deansoWeird
[1:25:49] WATERMELONFRESH: everyone wants to sip the tea KEKW
[1:25:50] Vivaciousx3: but the people getting punished have a warped view on the punishment
[1:25:57] scootypebbles92: *sip*
[1:25:59] Jessc1996: like learning from mistakes that people have in work places
[1:26:02] buddha_hands: if the victim of dapping is fine with putting it on blast as a learning experience, may as well do it to teach lol
[1:26:09] fellathedude: @brvtyy She was spying yesterday on a cruiser off-duty yesterday!
[1:26:11] xCheekz: stand on business though lol its a family remember shittt
[1:26:12] lolfish_rs: People 100% should know when/if someone is suspended incase they need them for certain cases
[1:26:12] RoninGundam: sounds like ppl want tea lmao
[1:26:14] xCheekz: lmfaooo
[1:26:18] Ned15: What if a suspended officer does something
[1:26:20] jacksmithcje: but thats why we have the divide cos its one side telling something
[1:26:21] strawberryraye: they want the gossip
[1:26:22] Rascal_PM: from an HR perspective you cannot do that lol
[1:26:22] Thraxton1: not telling anyone is terrible, everyone will end up knowing anyways
[1:26:23] SharkzGG_: esfandCOPS
[1:26:23] pallywacker117: make a report only viewable to the individual being suspended, and give it to them. Allowing them to share the document if they wish too
[1:26:29] 123fudgegamer: it shows transparency
[1:26:46] McKibbo: unnamed officer performed such action, what was done incorrectly, actions put in place or lessons learned.
[1:26:47] MarsCons: what does dap stand for?
[1:26:49] KillerKolsch: our suspensions would show on work schedules, but no details
[1:26:51] Ned15: If a suspended officer gets information because people don't know they are suspended
[1:26:52] RedBeardsActual: there is such a thing as being too transparent
[1:26:53] magnets_: if den wanted people to reach out to him during his suspension he couldve brought it up himself
[1:26:55] buddha_hands: but if they then present to everyone a skewed version of their punishments...
[1:26:59] zrynnn: @MarsCons disciplinary action point
[1:26:59] Peppermint_Wizard: Cornwood said he just wanted it communicated that someone HAD been suspended
[1:27:04] CuBanMumzy: they want the tea
[1:27:16] MarsCons: @zrynnn ty!
[1:27:37] Sathure: Should at least be a public report/announcement that so and so was suspended and is off duty.
[1:27:57] slomojosh: Cornwood genuinely wants to take Den under his wing
[1:28:01] Drkdream: who ever gets suspended should be able to get their report Hmmm
[1:28:04] SherbertRL: anonymous person in this situation did this and got suspended
[1:28:07] TheTourist_: pepeCD
[1:28:10] MlCRO_: Have they talked about the issues that were brought up about Ruth on the rooftop last night?
[1:28:17] Ned15: If Shiesty gets suspended and goes mad, someone lets him in and he takes PD equipment jonbKEK
[1:28:18] buddha_hands: better if an accurate version of events is presented to people VS if someone is heated & telling incorrect info to their peers lol
[1:28:20] scootypebbles92: Clarity is important
[1:28:21] SharkzGG_: that's what they do at work when I get written up, I get a print out after a talking to
[1:28:24] 1CaptainRedBeard1: That definitely should be a thing.
[1:28:27] lookingfornothinghere: if you already spoke to them why do they need it on paper
[1:28:27] ForgottenJones: Hmmm
[1:28:28] robertsmithjr: who wants to have a mistake broadcasted through out pc, and then there is potential for it to go public
[1:28:31] strawberryraye: So duplicate work?
[1:28:33] brvtyy: its a good idea
[1:28:33] slomojosh: @mlcro_ the off duty spying? no.
[1:28:34] rclemon_: @MlCRO_ yes
[1:28:34] MarsCons: that sounds solid
[1:28:37] Klint03: in writing
[1:28:38] 1CaptainRedBeard1: Verbal is meaningless, written is gold.
[1:28:39] hyotee: that's a good idea
[1:28:40] robertsmithjr: pd^
[1:28:40] StreamElements: What they said saabThat
[1:28:43] EdgeNorton: Transparency
[1:28:46] meeto_tv: also to refrence later for learning
[1:28:46] NumbLee: It's just professional
[1:28:46] ForgottenJones: yes
[1:28:50] anthr00: Because if it's not written it never happened
[1:28:59] BLazOR_Prime: document their punishment
[1:29:01] dapyman: @numblee exactly
[1:29:04] Klint03: any discipline should be in writing
[1:29:04] Drizzle1390: literally what a supervisor does lol. written report of disciplinary action
[1:29:06] DViousGaming: Why make reports at all if you spoke about
[1:29:06] Ned15: You have to protect yourself as well
[1:29:06] symbul_: wait did Denzel get suspended on MLK day?
[1:29:07] soysauce_rice: if there's something to nitpick on then captains should make sure there isnt before they assign the DAPs
[1:29:08] BLazOR_Prime: they have proof vs what someone “said”
[1:29:10] MlCRO_: @rclemon_ What did she have to say?
[1:29:10] M__Wolfe: Wait its not recorded? its just word of mouth?
[1:29:10] ethanmn1280: maybe cause people are emotional in the moment and have a clear head to absorb it the next day
[1:29:11] SuuWasTaken: i mean the captain nitpick on officers reports too no?
[1:29:12] wulfqs: captains want to be bosses lol. they don't want anyone to challenge them xD
[1:29:17] buddha_hands: if there's a point of reference, it should be harder to color the story in theory
[1:29:17] slomojosh: @symbul_ no
[1:29:21] i_eat_big_cakes: PDF receipt after conversation is a really good idea and promotes transparency.
[1:29:24] anthr00: If high command asked for proof of punishment and you have bo paperwork? Come on
[1:29:24] Money2Much: here we go LULW
[1:29:31] marneraiders: poor Denzel
[1:29:34] scootypebbles92: Explain the violation and coach them how to be better.
[1:29:39] MexiBrent: @wulfqs captains are the bosses
[1:29:39] rclemon_: @MlCRO_ the vods up, it was about 15 mins ago
[1:29:42] lookingfornothinghere: they should make Slacks write every single receipt PepeLaugh
[1:29:43] BLazOR_Prime: every job has a documentation handed to the employee on what did wrong
[1:29:44] davidpeck_: they should have to sign it in acknowledgement
[1:29:48] garowan: Memory is not absolute, people can misremember a conversation
[1:29:52] robertsmithjr: @anthr00 their not saying to not have it documented for command, but they dont agree with giving it out to the rest of pd
[1:29:59] robinthyme_: @davidpeck_ i agree
[1:30:04] TheTourist_: mhm
[1:30:10] slomojosh: @blazor_prime they usually gotta sign it too with hr or the bosses exemNod
[1:30:12] 1CaptainRedBeard1: It's a good idea.
[1:30:15] buddha_hands: maybe also what they should have done instead
[1:30:18] ForgottenJones: yeah
[1:30:18] BadRabbits: "it provides a learning opportunity for officers"
[1:30:19] robinthyme_: when u get written up at work u have to sign to acknowledge
[1:30:22] soysauce_rice: seems pretty standard
[1:30:23] anthr00: @robertsmithjr no right now it's not even being documented and giving it to the person that got it
[1:30:24] Ficktions: That way, if you DAP them, but they complain about it to Ruth, she knows what really occurred
[1:30:30] BadRabbits: cadets can see what is bad
[1:30:30] DynamiteZeddy: DAP duration should be brought up. 60 days a is a long time in the game.
[1:30:32] Rivath: Denzel definitely hasn't articulated why he got daps well
[1:30:34] MexiBrent: maybe just record it
[1:30:38] neiro025: Sounds like people just want to tea sip LUL
[1:30:39] Ross_McD: Luke cletus said, correction not punishment
[1:30:43] BLazOR_Prime: @slomojosh yep, protects the employee and the company to have it in writing
[1:30:45] Klint03: no proof without paperwork
[1:30:46] pigeon_6417: Hmmm
[1:30:46] ArdentCause: most jobs will give you an email or written notification for anything you get in trouble for
[1:30:47] octagonner: they can't misrepresent it to other officers either
[1:30:49] LJD420: the reality is if the PD continues to go the way its going it will crumble plain and simple
[1:30:51] morelazymondays: hai hai xiceO
[1:30:55] JTB_099: Also will protect the capts from heresay in the case of a lawsuit
[1:30:55] WanderSky: LUL don't want it in writing so they can add bs?
[1:31:08] psicosmoker1979: and that help you if a MO is repeating
[1:31:13] ClipsBott: {Use ' !clip  [title] ' command to create a clip that is automatically sent to the #twitchclips channel on Discord ClappyHype }
[1:31:13] WanderSky: he said she said
[1:31:18] robertsmithjr: @anthr00 i'd imagine its probably in command communications
[1:31:21] Klint03: its for later when you forget
[1:31:23] 1CaptainRedBeard1: Ruth and Turner seem to be dodging accountability for daps they want to issue. Anything can be said verbally, written is set in stone.
[1:31:25] slomojosh: so go to trials with your employees?
[1:31:25] marneraiders: I feel like it’s always about “punishment and not correcting”
[1:31:26] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: deansoWeird deansoWeird deansoWeird

[1:34:19] anthr00: Yesh but it's documented and they have a copy they signed so it can't be lied about later
[1:34:19] Klint03: if its not in writing it never happened
[1:34:22] MiroBlaze: this is something a union rep would set up to protect the officers
[1:34:23] skedaddelr: @Ssaab it's about it being official words of a captain rather than he said/she said
[1:34:25] julieannxox: @xypher85 Stare
[1:34:27] Ficktions: I feel like it's just a good thing for writing. Like, if Ruth did it when she dapped Denzel, you'd be able to look at the report and see exactly why the DAP was provided... Not sure why it's argued

[1:36:48] danielb2705: Basically bulletpointing

[1:36:56] slomojosh: @tofuhai that’s on the captains to correct
[1:36:58] strawberryraye: just seems so unnecessary
[1:36:58] WanderSky: @eff_han true LUL
[1:37:00] srinath007: We used to do Five Why's and Root Cause Analyses, and file it so it acts as documentation of what's done, what went wrong and how we reacted, etc.
[1:37:07] garowan: Clarity
[1:37:09] BLazOR_Prime: something they can reference
[1:37:10] MarsCons: people are gold fish
[1:37:10] TheMah1337: That sounds fair to me, it also saves you from being sued if someone thinks they were wrongfuly punished
[1:37:11] zrynnn: some people might just be intimidated to talk in the moment
[1:37:14] SuuWasTaken: Captains want to rule PD black and white but dont want to explain black and white
[1:37:17] Ned15: They will not retain the information and be mad
[1:37:18] buddha_hands: people walk away with the wrong conclusions a lot of times
[1:37:20] schizz: It's why you write incident reports, documentation...plain and simple
[1:37:27] kryilce: it's also a way that they can be confident that the captain's have some accountability held to them
[1:37:28] FabTheDuckOut: 1.violation 2.explanation 3.corrective action
[1:37:28] doctorp_: same standard as for other reports
[1:37:29] i_eat_big_cakes: Something to reference and look back to when they want to review their DAPs.
[1:37:34] thatclubdj: You can use it as reference if a similar situation occurs and not rely solely on officer memory
[1:37:35] ForgottenJones: yup
[1:37:37] Peppermint_Wizard: @suuwastaken truth
[1:37:38] eaglezFly: Ruth being against Documentation is odd.
[1:37:38] Artsii1994: Keeping it simple and clean not a full on report just to clarify what they did wrong. But how will they take it in.
[1:37:40] Krimson07_: NODDERS
[1:37:42] ForgottenJones: Ruth is right
[1:37:43] wiglaf__: i mean if they can't articulate that, should they be giving the DAP in the first place? seems simple enough
[1:37:45] BLazOR_Prime: when they are mad and heated you may forget things or rememebe things differently but the paper covers it
[1:37:46] widbar: DAP points should go down based on time on shift instead of 60 days. Cornwood being on shift 14 hours per day is more likely to get DAP than someone that plays much less.
[1:37:48] Ned15: Hmmm
[1:37:48] xCheekz: cracking a cold one
[1:37:49] Ingenic: its meant to be a reminder of the conversation, no?

[1:37:53] RedBeardsActual: Brewski time
[1:37:54] colon___: is there gonna be mention of the spying?
[1:37:55] gman0425: y'all need HR department
[1:37:55] Artsii1994: Cause they may not react the same way
[1:37:57] lillukeii: she doesn’t want a paper trail
[1:37:58] yeovic: could just list the violations and nothing more
[1:37:59] eqnjn: Maybe save it for once you have IA to do the paperwork for you
[1:37:59] MarsCons: nice
[1:37:59] 999something: Cant expect them to remeber something over 30 days out
[1:38:00] AndroTTV: It's not for the officer they discussed it with, it's for other officers to refer to
[1:38:02] kiolkjm: i almost feel like you should lose 1 dap off your record per 7irl days would be pretty fair
[1:38:07] ArdentCause: true cornwood shiesty on shifts for 12-14 hours
[1:38:08] scootypebbles92: Speaking of the next dap *looks at Ruth*
[1:38:08] slabbyj_: cornwood will definitely hit 10 DAPs
[1:38:11] MordecaiTheBrown: make the officers that are getting dapped write the reports so the captains know they understand what they did wrong LUL
[1:38:12] neiro025: Ramee about to have those reports in less than 24 hours
[1:38:14] Alpha___0_0: bring up Ruth off duty spying
[1:38:17] anthr00: Suspended without documentation, yeah we'd be in court
[1:38:18] tofuhai: saab waking up early HOLY COPIUM
[1:38:28] buddha_hands: monkaW
[1:38:31] 1CaptainRedBeard1: @slabbyj_ He's 100% going to hit 10. lol
[1:38:32] Gewitters: Recording keeping to be used in performance evals and a records associated with improvement or a pattern of continued violation and lack of professionalism. Simple stuff. Convo's don't get remembered after 2 days
[1:38:33] th3gamingsquare: If you handing  out a dap you should be able articulate
[1:38:43] viciouswx: Is driving cruisers off duty allowed?
[1:38:48] slomojosh: no one wants to police I wonder why
[1:38:49] schizz: It's ironic that the example they are using is for someone who was suspended for poor report writing, and they can't understand why documentation of DAP points is required.
[1:38:50] DryIce06: DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance
[1:38:53] johnmalkovich95: 1 brave officer vs whole city CORNMAN

[1:39:07] viciouswx: esfandCOPS
[1:39:08] zrynnn: @widbar yeah if they want to keep the 60 day thing i think there should be like a -1 DAP for every 100 hours on duty with no daps. that way people that work long hours like Cornwood and Sheisty wont be afraid to go on duty and get fired
[1:39:08] BLazOR_Prime: @schizz exactly, how ironic
[1:39:09] TheMah1337: Cornwood
[1:39:12] morris_on_twitch: esfandCOPS mentioned

[1:39:44] widbar: @widbar Exactly. The 60 days IRL thing just disincentive playing as cop
[1:39:53] Krimson07_: he wants a master doc for all ppo votes
[1:40:08] tofuhai: u only ever get DAP for shit police work chat its very easy not to get any
[1:40:18] hyotee: @zrynnn fully agreed
[1:40:20] eaglezFly: @tofuhai wrong
[1:40:27] Artsii1994: So he wants a report of each report so they van make a vote based on there performance
[1:40:53] octagonner: no he just wants to change the title from "fto vote" to "promoted"
[1:41:00] Smypher: oh yeah Cornwood wants FTO
[1:41:09] Belvai: Its been over 30 days and only 2 peeps are close to 10 daps, 60 days is fine

[2:04:50] M4verick1986: it should be harder this is what happened with bass 3.0 he started off going hard on officers and then he went to a whole soft PD that could do anything they wanted
[2:04:51] jinnytolls: Amount of hours worked should matter here
[2:04:51] timtheboneman: especially when you dish out 7 at a time
[2:04:51] DannyL3tscher: it makes people not want to work LUL

[2:04:56] Thraxton1: 60 is actually ooc INSANE and I cant actually beleive the players of these characters are eeven considering it like it's not going to cause a lot of pd to just quit
[2:04:57] Jurgen___: she stays silence and then tries to give den 5 in 1 go though

[2:05:05] Ned15: You have to train them though
[2:05:05] anoobmove_twitch: wrong it makes them not work till it falls off xdd
[2:05:06] th3gamingsquare: Its like punishing who spend more time on shift
[2:05:07] Koll0: What about making it easier to make DAPs disappear with good work? Just like you get DAPped by doing bad work, make it possible to reduce them with good work
[2:05:07] garowan: toxic leadership
[2:05:09] Fozy15: How about 350 hours worked?
[2:05:12] marneraiders: great discussion
[2:05:13] Arkeren: 60 ooc is actually insane
[2:05:13] jacksmithcje: cornwood got 7 in  week then 900 hrs later can get rid of them

[2:05:25] dylanconlon6: den zel won’t do police work 😂
[2:05:26] xTyyuki: what is 60 days irl?
[2:05:28] tinywulf: it escalates way too quickly
[2:05:28] dains84: 60 days, increase to 15?
[2:05:29] srinath007: 15 daps before?
[2:05:30] bhawkins1302: ease the number of daps per time could be a suggestion?
[2:05:30] MexiBrent: youre only afraid if you didnt learn from your mistakes
[2:05:32] cello_gus: suspend at 10 sit them at 15?
[2:05:32] dapyman: 10 dap 48 hours suspension
[2:05:32] B__M__C: if DAPS are 60, months of jail time needs to be hours not 1 minute...
[2:05:32] dreggy69: they shouldnt be so egregiously different imo
[2:05:34] RebornOffline: 15 instead of 10
[2:05:36] zrynnn: like 10 is a 48 hour suspension, 15 is fired?
[2:05:36] 999something: Cornwood and shiesty because they do all the hours
[2:05:37] moodymellow: @xTyyuki it is 60 days irl time
[2:05:37] shramtots: they be DAP stacking its BULLSHIT
[2:05:37] DannyL3tscher: more milestones?
[2:05:38] casuallyeast: She took a police car off duty lmao why isn’t that a dap?
[2:05:38] NexusXXIII: desk duty
[2:05:41] ChrisTHS: At 4 and 8?
[2:05:44] xypher85: 12-14 hour shift compared to 5 hour shift, I dont think thats fair
[2:05:46] ItsSevenD: allow people to work overtime to get rid of points
[2:05:47] octagonner: 2 cops having this issue out of 60 is surely the systems fault, not those 2 cops KEKW
[2:05:47] Evilzanz: even if ruth says she aint out for cornwood she clerly is just listen to the way she brings him up all the time
[2:05:48] Eddie1225: @casuallyeast 1 she wasn't off duty
[2:05:48] jonwuk: 48 hour suspension at 10
[2:05:48] OldOhana: some stuff should be a suspension and not a dap?
[2:05:48] Eddie1225: 2
[2:05:48] zac4e: I think there should be some oversight on stuff like reports, this is RP. Not real life
[2:05:50] its_me_mpyy: @xTyyuki 60 days.
[2:05:50] Shastoos: cops literally not coming to work cause they scared lol
[2:05:50] Ned15: @xtyyuki  60 days LUL
[2:05:51] issues_i: Corn works 15 hours per day
[2:05:52] Eddie1225: shes HC she can do that
[2:05:52] markshev: base it on hours worked
[2:05:53] jinnytolls: Daps is a much harsher punishment than any crimes on the server
[2:05:55] Kfoo_: 5 dap, 24, 10 DAPs a week, 15 perma or something?
[2:05:57] B__M__C: 60 days might as well be character perma
[2:05:59] 1CaptainRedBeard1: @BMCkalip That's kind of the thing. Lol. Time is all over the place here. THere's more punishment for being a COP than a Criminal.
[2:06:00] bullet_soul24: I wish they'd explain the reasoning behind their stances and maybe I'd understand
[2:06:01] RexMophinos: 60 days for cornwood is 900 hours on duty, he does 15 hours a day
[2:06:01] Chaimander: 1 dap per incident then
[2:06:01] MlCRO_: 60 days is crazy
[2:06:01] neiro025: Cornwood and denzel just want to be able to fuck around without consequence LUL
[2:06:01] SwitchBord001: @casuallyeast Good question
[2:06:02] FabTheDuckOut: take the daps or get suspended 24hr per dap
[2:06:03] EdgeNorton: Cops need to unionize
[2:06:09] media_blitz: yo thats true 30 days statute of limitations but 60 for daps?!
[2:06:09] Gr1mR3afer: crims have 1month = 1min, if they had the same time they would spend this 3600 years for the sentence
[2:06:10] momzzyy: 60 days is wild,I've seen hienous criminals get like 100months=100mins
[2:06:11] M__Wolfe: Cops literally punished more than crims gd
[2:06:12] i_eat_big_cakes: 60 days is way too much. Cornwood and Sheisty accrued more than 5 DAPs in 30 days.
[2:06:13] media_blitz: messed up
[2:06:13] TheDev97: hm
[2:06:14] robertsmithjr: honestly is it really that hard to just not get daps
[2:06:16] Ficktions: Complaining about not having cops now - wait until people get to 8 daps and don't work for two months lol
[2:06:16] B__M__C: @1CaptainRedBeard1 absolutely
[2:06:17] MarsCons: 45 sounds good and could always change it
[2:06:17] Eddie1225: @i_eat_big_cakes then
[2:06:18] Ryaht: gonna loose players that way i think
[2:06:18] viciouswx: That's 2 of the best cops y'all have, not the worst
[2:06:18] barrdock: They spend the most time online though, so it's more likely they get a dap
[2:06:24] tinywulf: 45 days ruins her plans to fire people
[2:06:25] anthr00: That's almost 2 months
[2:06:26] anoobmove_twitch: I mean months are seconds in game.. so daps for 3 minutes?
[2:06:27] Eddie1225: dont get dapped
[2:06:27] lajmenno: staggered falloff? 4 gone after 30, rest gone after 60
[2:06:28] no0b_l0l: crystNom
[2:06:30] Eddie1225: its not hard
[2:06:30] Rascal_PM: easier to get suspended than a 24 hour hold lol

[2:09:07] 幸福考拉: Isnt the idea of good behaviour to remove bad things kinda a general thing anyway? dont you get redcued prison time for good behaviour and things like that?
[2:09:07] Grumplestillskin: losing DAPs based on WORK HOURS would be a good change
[2:09:09] dreggy69: ruth doesnt want to give them a way to make up for their mistakes like whaaaat
[2:09:10] moondropsoup: no
[2:09:10] UrsaMinor5432: the strike system was working pretty well by the end of 3.0

[2:09:13] ixpops: there are no incentives to being a good police officer

[2:09:14] GoutOfWar: @zyzzzo Chatting
[2:09:14] MlCRO_: It's RP in a video game. People need to be allowed to mess around a little.
[2:09:14] freen87: true because half of the streamers will not be playing past 30 days. the hdmi takes over
[2:09:14] dillzz21: or they wont do anything ?
[2:09:14] dreggy69: (and turner too)
[2:09:14] octagonner: it doesn't take you 60 days, you just don't accumulate 10 daps in 60 days LUL
[2:09:15] ForgottenJones: im with ruth
[2:09:15] Janizki_Fin: Not everyone is gonna be like that.
[2:09:15] xCheekz: nah they are gunna do less work in fear of more daps
[2:09:15] RexPappa: Some dude had a good idea, where at a certain number of DAPs you win a ride along with a senior officer
[2:09:16] ZobeyZobes: yeah she has a toddler
[2:09:16] Ned15: More training ajimmyGriddy ajimmyGriddy
[2:09:16] wulfqs: looks like ruth is more interested in punishment rather than correcting
[2:09:16] skinnylegend000: it’s like PD quest giving for improvement
[2:09:17] moodymellow: @Ssaab or they'll stop showing up all together
[2:09:17] buddha_hands: or stop waking up in a worst case lol
[2:09:17] moondropsoup: yes
[2:09:18] boppindolphin: yeh 10 in 60 days is a joke people are gonna start ghosting

[2:09:20] glumclaws: hi ssaab I found you through Mizkif
[2:09:21] squirtlehermit: I have seen it in my workplace. only punishment and no rewards leads to complacent workers
[2:09:21] slomojosh: OMEGALUL
[2:09:22] Not_Viable: max 1 dap per shift
[2:09:23] doctorp_: what matters more the punishment or the improvement
[2:09:24] Galfarionz: in 60 days theyy will urned out of rp tbh, its too much
[2:09:25] LSPXI: You would compare People Who are on futy 6hours versus 14hours
[2:09:25] Fozy15: 60 days is a long time for your 14 hour shift officers. Someone like Parmesan who is on duty once a month then yes 60 days.
[2:09:25] Rascal_PM: exaxtly, this is also a video game, not even real life cops have it this bad
[2:09:27] Antdavs24: crims get positive reinforcement but the cops cant that's the look unfortunately
[2:09:29] LeZenon: everyone makes mistakes soonner or later just to strict dap policy LUL
[2:09:30] Fusegate: hours worked should have an impact on removing daps. Cornwood doing 13 hours a days and is a lot more likely to make mistakes
[2:09:31] ilmarcusil: esfandCOPS uh oh
[2:09:31] lora1969: Chatting
[2:09:31] uCyberWolf: Whats the point of a prison sentence if the crime is always held over your head.
[2:09:32] hyotee: the problem is about playing hours, someone who works 5 hours a week is never doing as much mistakes as someone who works 50 hours a week
[2:09:33] Wynter282: daps are just handed out too much they should be limited to 2 per discipline action taken
[2:09:34] MarsCons: 60 is the too long if 30 days for statue of limitations. 45 seems fair middle ground
[2:09:35] God_is_a_cat_girl: cops will just do 2 jaywalk tickets daily and go off duty LULW
[2:09:36] xnightshift2658: Slack wants them to learn
[2:09:38] Krimson07_: yea people who get punished instead of learning from it, they double down LULW
[2:09:39] moondropsoup: mizkifHypers
[2:09:40] Neekapkilla: 60 days is 840 hours on the clock for cornwood
[2:09:40] zeike_nz: or they are just not going to do the work
[2:09:40] robertsmithjr: they are police officers though not children, at their age they shouldnt be that worried they will get in trouble
[2:09:41] jacksmithcje: cornwood got a dap for saying hes sheriff yet ruth says her office hows that work#
[2:09:43] H00TYWH0: if you cant stack charges you shouldnt be able to stack DAPs
[2:09:47] bhawkins1302: chat going crazy
[2:09:47] smbsocal: DAPs should be removed after X hours of duty not IRL days
[2:09:48] zyzzzo: GoutOfWar Chatting DAP this DAP that, "Improve" oh nvm DAP
[2:09:50] SherbertRL: ReallyMad Mizkif @glumclaws
[2:09:50] GoutOfWar: @squirtlehermit this is gonna blow your mind but this isn't real life, these are make believe cops and the punishments are fake
[2:09:52] Jibry: chat the captain can dap each other. each captain has a DAP already and I’m pretty sure Ruth has 2 herself so stop saying captains  don’t get DAPS LUL
[2:09:52] neiro025: @Fozy15 14 hour shifts is not a normal thing and shouldn't be built around
[2:09:56] dreggy69: rehabilitation vs punishment
[2:09:59] Drkdream: slacks speaking facts EZ Clap
[2:09:59] kryilce: Daps should be based on actual ingame time, not IRL time.
[2:09:59] i_eat_big_cakes: Ruth and Turner are more interested in punishing over rehabilitation.
[2:10:00] shramtots: @jacksmithcje BASED that one is crazy
[2:10:01] GonBonkin: Need an official dap contesting process, if the dap gets repealed the captain which gave it gets a dap for giving incorrect daps
[2:10:02] MlCRO_: @jacksmithcje Facts
[2:10:03] illuwe: Crims can murder 10 people and get out of jail in hours and cops are held resposible for 60 days
[2:10:04] srinath007: Opportunity to do better
[2:10:04] Nluages: @smbsocal yeah makes more sense too that's smart
[2:10:04] media_blitz: let captains dap eachother
[2:10:06] media_blitz: easy
[2:10:07] Real_Bugz: deansoSpin deansoSpin deansoSpin deansoSpin deansoSpin
[2:10:11] DanoeJW: big problem is the DAPs dont come instantly all the time like denzels was like 2 weeks worth of daps all at once so no chance to know something was up til it was too late
[2:10:12] lookingfornothinghere: you cant help people that dont want to be helped
[2:10:13] Ned15: Yeah
[2:10:13] YokaiJames: people are in jail for 20 minutes. cops have to be perfect for 60 days
[2:10:13] squirtlehermit: @GoutOfWar yeah of course, but they're RPing that it's a police office
[2:10:13] DannyL3tscher: @neiro025 that's why I think it should fall off with time played instead of irl time
[2:10:14] ArdentCause: yes
[2:10:14] itWyrm: no good, ONLY BAD Madge
[2:10:16] moodymellow: Yes

[2:10:18] seanlew123: i agree 60 days is to much

[2:10:26] scootypebbles92: Shiesty's failure is Ruth's fault
[2:10:26] LJD420: the reality is if the  60 day period doesn't get changed a lot of your officers will just stop showing up
[2:10:27] ALFE_: Without teaching and rehabilitation they'll do the same shit, I feel Slacks on that
[2:10:27] Chickenplucker26: Attitude and performance reflect leadership
[2:10:28] tinywulf: damn right leadership needs to hold trhemselves acountable
[2:10:29] MlCRO_: 30 days

[2:10:32] glumclaws: Is Turner the boss of the entire police?
[2:10:34] bertacharm: like how she wont ride with sheisty...
[2:10:34] ChillyIslander: i would never touch cop rp on this server, i'd be too stressed
[2:10:34] PluFF: Training for fixable mistakes
[2:10:36] xnightshift2658: Kinda hard ruth when you wont help when someone asks for it
[2:10:36] charybdes: you can take driving classes to remove points off your license, refresher training isn't a bad idea.
[2:10:36] Ryaht: it does start at the top
[2:10:37] 7_K_M: it should be every few weeks a couple points fall off rather then at 60 they all fall off hold them accountable for longer periods of time
[2:10:37] InvictoNZ: dangle carrots, make it so you cant progress ranks or certs or departments if you have any daps in the last 30 days
[2:10:37] zac4e: Let her fire everyone that dont meet her standars and let her stand alone hryLaf
[2:10:38] shramtots: @Yidz give them all 10 DAPS
[2:10:38] Maethra: LUL

[2:24:45] TurboDistrict: @GonBonkin I agree with this, just dont think its lieing, more like mismanagement?

[2:26:54] Artsii1994: YEAAAAAA

[2:27:13] Janizki_Fin: peepoHappy peepoHappy
[2:27:14] TurboDistrict: @GonBonkin yes for sure, he should be reprimanded for that, not for lieing
[2:27:16] KenThirteen: Does she want him to be guilty?
[2:27:17] King_Rexy: Stare
[2:27:32] ArdentCause: If the bill identifies as a coin then yes

[2:27:41] Kfoo_: Stupidity is actually a defense lol
[2:27:46] Drkdream: its based on what you believe no? Hmmm
[2:27:53] octagonner: no, she is saying he said there are no serial numbers but there are
[2:27:54] Ned15: it's hard because it's a game mechanic, rolled bills = dirty money so people assume
[2:27:59] ArdentCause: true just use the Ramee technique saying "IDK"

[2:29:16] uCyberWolf: You cant accusing him of lieing. Maybe he was just wrong
[2:29:17] Alekdk1: Slacks needs to eat or he’ll pass out
[2:29:20] TurboDistrict: oh shit she gunna shoot!

[2:30:42] Ned15: this is a tough one
[2:30:43] Moobot: Thank you for subbing, xd3licious_! Welcome to the Saabscribers! saabH
[2:30:49] Spired12: bobby lying? he'd never
[2:30:49] Nick_The_Mechanick: She wants Den Fired so badly
[2:30:51] ArdentCause: then the judge should have done a better job
[2:30:52] zenyatta: @Ned15 not really imo
[2:30:57] xd3licious_: Ask her to show you the rolled money and have he read the serial numbers
[2:30:59] 1CaptainRedBeard1: @Ned15 Its literally a mechanics issue. It needs to be just dropped for now.
[2:31:00] fellathedude: Ruth Lying!!!
[2:31:04] 1CaptainRedBeard1: Yeah, it's problematic, but eh.
[2:31:09] Ned15: yeah it's arguing how a mechanic works
[2:31:21] hiicks_: If she can see the serial numbers on it then she should be able to read them out no?
[2:31:22] uCyberWolf: you have to prove intent
[2:31:22] RoxyA87: @xd3licious_ good point
[2:31:22] Ned15: A dev should decide
[2:31:23] redmistintheair: LETSGO
[2:31:24] HaychSD: Uh oh Den 'zel in troubleeee
[2:31:33] HaychSD: @Ned15 thats  OOC though, no?
[2:31:34] Ned15: A dev says it has no serials numbers or is wet etc
[2:31:43] ClipsBott: {Use ' !clip  [title] ' command to create a clip that is automatically sent to the #twitchclips channel on Discord ClappyHype }
[2:31:44] moondropsoup: hmmm
[2:31:44] Ned15: Then officer says that
[2:31:49] zenyatta: lying implies that the person intentionally told an untrue thing, the intent can't really be proven if he was just going off what an informant gave him
[2:31:55] Ned15: @HaychSD that is why it's tough
[2:32:06] Drkdream: A
[2:32:08] Drkdream: AAAA
[2:32:08] zrynnn: monkaS
[2:32:09] ArdentCause: heres my question why is it that she is so pro perjury on him and slacks and turner aren't it shows a massive flaw in character (obviously not cheever) but RP wise
[2:32:11] Koll0: Holy fuck that was an aggressive No
[2:32:13] RoxyA87: woah
[2:32:14] King_Rexy: TheVoices
[2:32:15] HaychSD: @Ned15 I think it's down the IC to justify it
[2:32:21] lookingfornothinghere: pretty sure Den roleplayed out the money being dirty ie he said its wet and no serial numbers like saying when food item is past date and looks rotten in game it looks normal
[2:32:24] GonBonkin: He didn't lie, he just didn't do his due diligence
[2:32:26] zenyatta: at worst, it's failing to double check info
[2:32:35] dakota22446: wideduckass
[2:32:35] zrynnn: yeah i think he just said that as roleplay
[2:32:38] Ficktions: Under the definition of Perjury, they'd have to *intentionally* mislead the court.
[2:32:41] Drkdream: saabO
[2:32:45] Ned15: wideduckass
[2:32:50] TheTourist_: WideJigglin
[2:32:51] surelyURjokingMrFeynman: did shiesty ever see the bills?
[2:32:53] Artsii1994: wideduckass
[2:33:01] gadget_t: She is right about that.
[2:33:05] zumanesta: i think she is right on this one
[2:33:08] ArdentCause: @Ficktions  i dont think the MDT has the word though sadly so it kinda plays out differently
[2:33:11] lora1969: there has to be wiggle room for mistakes
[2:33:14] JustinBinder: ruth really wants den gone o7
[2:33:26] KenThirteen: imagine your captain arguing that you should be charged with a crime
[2:33:28] lookingfornothinghere: i mean can the judge prove those rolled up bills have a serial number?
[2:33:29] fellathedude: he had a whole investion about it
[2:33:30] Ficktions: @ArdentCause Do we know what the perjury verbiage is in the MDT?
[2:33:31] KenThirteen: crazy
[2:33:35] zenyatta: is there a reason ruth wants him gone so bad? i m,ust be missing lore
[2:33:44] dakota22446: Tomfoolery
[2:33:45] Krimson07_: Tomfoolery
[2:33:47] ArdentCause: @Ficktions yeah he just pulled it up but it doesnt say malice intent
[2:33:52] redmistintheair: raid all day
[2:33:55] Drkdream: 100%
[2:33:56] Ficktions: @ArdentCause Oof
[2:34:02] Ficktions: *Instant* raid. lol
[2:34:18] Ned15: it was not 42kg right it should be 920
[2:34:25] Kfoo_: I think that Ruth believes Shiesty lied, and that in her eyes is a fireable offense which I think is fair.  But she may not be right in thinking that he actually lied
[2:34:28] Ned15: 900 grams
[2:34:36] ArdentCause: I think it got updated last night
[2:34:42] ArdentCause: to 10gs a bag
[2:34:44] SanchoPanza49: 41kg is 90lbs
[2:34:47] tofuhai: weights already changed for weed to the correct amount so its iffy

[2:35:06] Ned15: @SanchoPanza49 bags are mislabeled showed .5 KG instead of 10 g LuL
[2:35:14] Phage_Cleaver: It does though
[2:35:14] zenyatta: @Kfoo_ thats just a little odd to not give the benefit of the doubt to one of her own officers but idk
[2:35:14] MSif7: @Kfoo_ I was watching during the stream, it seems it was more related to bad information.
[2:35:15] mikeysant69: RAID RAID RAID
[2:35:15] pluck_it: 1 lb of weed IS NOT THE SAME AS 80 LBS
[2:35:25] Kfoo_: @MSif7 fair enough
[2:35:29] mikeysant69: 1 pound = 80 pounds
[2:35:32] Drkdream: but weed its completely ilegal right now Hmmm
[2:35:34] mikeysant69: raid
[2:35:36] Ficktions: Wait, doesn't the verbiage in MDT over intent to sell say something like a large amount OR a pattern/large amount of money/etc.? Not AND?
[2:35:40] zrynnn: @mikeysant69 the math aint mathing
[2:35:43] WildWillie419: the real police do it all the time
[2:35:44] MSif7: He had a long stream going and if memory serves the whole court case was a bit of a hot mess.
[2:35:45] ArdentCause: 1lb of weed is still a shit ton- as an avid smoker I get 3 ounces a month and that is a ton
[2:35:49] KenThirteen: it’s still a violent crime though
[2:35:55] dakota22446: wideNessie

[2:36:28] dakota22446: raid THIS
[2:36:38] TheTourist_: saabWiggle
[2:36:38] Drkdream: @dakota22446 saabOwo
[2:36:39] King_Rexy: AAAA
[2:36:50] RandomShungiteCD: Is this a case of just because you can you should?
[2:36:53] Ned15: THIS
[2:36:59] dakota22446: GODDID
[2:37:04] Ned15: @RandomShungiteCD yes
[2:37:10] Fozy15: Raids need to be more quality based. If it's mid then leave it alone. Ain't worth it. LUL
[2:37:20] ArdentCause: I think it is the case but idk 92 little bags is still a ton
[2:37:24] M3disyn: FeelsDankMan
[2:37:26] lookingfornothinghere: yeah cops trying to connect the dots to locations where the drugs came from for a raid is literally better RP for both parties
[2:37:37] Ficktions: @RandomShungiteCD Yes, but the dude had *92* bags of weed on him. ONE person isn't going to be smoking that alone lol
[2:37:42] charybdes: wasn't the same as the other case.
[2:37:52] ArdentCause: regardless of weight its 92 bags like bruh
[2:37:58] ArdentCause: even snoop aint doing that
[2:37:59] Ficktions: Exactly lol
[2:38:03] Ficktions: LUL
[2:38:13] Ficktions: If you plan to smoke it alone, you keep it all in one bag.
[2:38:22] lookingfornothinghere: 4.0 props being able to be placed make raids with items on property way too easy so its good to investigate
[2:38:27] chaosproductions: a search warrant does not need 100% certainty, just RAS
[2:38:47] Ned15: @chaosproductions in the server you need way more for everything
[2:38:47] TheTourist_: SNIFFA
[2:38:56] octagonner: search warrants are usually the start of an investigation irl but in game it is a much bigger deal
[2:38:59] ArdentCause: Yeah I think cutting corners makes the RP boring, thats why I enjoy the cornwood shenanigans because he really does try to build it up massively
[2:39:07] MSif7: But, it's a water-intensive plant.
[2:39:07] Ned15: @chaosproductions people don't want to ruin RP
[2:39:25] Ned15: NODDERS
[2:39:28] charybdes: it was found on him and at the time 46kilos WAS the amount(you break rp because you knew the #'s were wrong) and it should have been a raid.
[2:39:35] MSif7: Is there water costs for weed ingame?
[2:39:36] chaosproductions: @Ned15 but if you need 100% certainty, then you have enough to convict and the search warrant isnt needed
[2:39:43] lookingfornothinghere: people need to realize this is a new problem that only exists in 4.0 because of the placable props everywhere
[2:39:49] MSif7: Like, do you need water for them?
[2:39:58] Nickomongo: did the big captain talk happen already? or is this it
[2:40:05] Ficktions: @MSif7 They gonna write water off as a business expense? LUL
[2:40:06] Ned15: @chaosproductions it is just the way the server works, cops have to work very very hard and provide long term rp
[2:40:12] Ficktions: @Nickomongo This is it
[2:40:18] lookingfornothinghere: PD investigating and trying to connect drugs to a location/stash is the way probably instead of instant pump
[2:40:21] Nickomongo: sheeeesh
[2:40:23] CuBanMumzy: so denzel perjured or not?
[2:40:24] ArdentCause: yeah gotta sep real life stuff and in game stuff - some of those things dont exist and its to hard to try and portray it- if were doing Real life RP cops- 99% of people would have been shot already lmfaoooo
[2:40:47] chaosproductions: @Ned15 totally understood. It is something that should use judgment calls. not a 1-size fits all rule
[2:40:51] Ned15: @ArdentCause the whole city would be in jail
[2:40:55] daenerhis: @CuBanMumzy ruth believes so. turner and slacks dont believe he intentionally lied
[2:40:56] surelyURjokingMrFeynman: never do two crimes at once
[2:41:06] MSif7: @Ficktions All manner of things can lead police to find weed grows like when people run heaters in their attics.
[2:41:11] Ned15: if we went by IRL law the whole city would have been convicted at least once LuL
[2:41:31] 0zarruu: what if you arrest someone with a glock for stabbing someone, you cant charge for possession??
[2:41:33] charybdes: Andrew's is irl cop, even he said wtf 46kilos, raid easy.
[2:41:34] octagonner: @ArdentCause the only issue i have is that court looks for real life level evidence for some crimes which is close to impossible
[2:41:52] ArdentCause: @CuBanMumzy if you watch him (not in a bad way) he 100% did because he has been told that you can't assume bench trials set precedent for the rolled bills- but he took his CI word and the prior case and used it as a reference knowing its not 10000% true
[2:42:10] MSif7: The biggest tell though for weed grows is power usage.
[2:42:27] YOUDOG2G: @MSif7 people have computers
[2:42:31] ArdentCause: @octagonner  i totally agree the court portion is kinda rough- because cops cant do their jobs and they are being required to do things that are out of scope
[2:42:41] ixpops: 10 grams in irl weed is like 100 bucks roughly
[2:42:44] Ficktions: Garden of Eatin' Doritos
[2:42:52] Ned15: @ixpops Susge
[2:42:57] Kfoo_: he's been makin' those jazz cigarettes
[2:43:04] ArdentCause: straight up 1 ounce of weed is like 90$ lmfao
[2:43:08] Capn_Stew: Cornwood and Den want to go swimming for sea "weed" LULW
[2:43:20] MSif7: honestly at this point i'd try and go after getting rolled bills identified as crim items compared to weed busts
[2:43:45] MSif7: contaminated money or something
[2:43:56] Nickomongo: eat fooood
[2:44:05] ArdentCause: Honestly some of these things could already be discovered but some RP-ers choose to ignore it because it progresses things a bit to fast when things aren't fully built up yet
[2:44:15] MSif7: @Ssaab you're gonna pass out, food
[2:44:24] Ned15: I can see the "Camping" allegations already LuL

[3:35:24] Andersxa: NODDERS good way to do it
[3:35:25] tinywulf: wow i feel like there is a line between rp and rl jobs.

[3:35:29] CuBanMumzy: is she the boss?
[3:35:31] Ficktions: @Vahyl__ IT's needed. It's been weeks since they've gathered.
[3:35:35] ItsSevenD: DISPATCH?
[3:35:36] Logic_Lab: RP rules between the criminals and pd are not fair at all
[3:35:38] woolfdesign: I object
[3:35:43] nick_cola86: @BaldPanda360 it seems like they're moving away from cops being RP content with all this strictness... they is literally as detailed as a real job. I just want good RP.
[3:35:44] MikeOochieStank: Ruth’s RP is great bc I hate her
[3:35:46] Ficktions: @CuBanMumzy Nope. All equal in power

[3:35:53] charminherman: Cornwood and Denzel never talking to slacks about anything again, just turned out worse for them lol
[3:35:54] limerick2018: Wait who is Cornwood actual shift he is listed on
[3:35:54] ScoresWest: @spired12 true he definitely does forget sometimes, just didn’t expect it to be THAT often
[3:35:55] Artsii1994: @missdolly2 oh yea for sure gotta keep it serious and have a bit of humor with it as well.
[3:35:58] MlCRO_: @mikeoochiestank Facts
[3:36:01] theaverage_joe4: @Logic_Lab What's unfair about them?

[3:36:21] Ficktions: @limerick2018 The dude's on duty for 13-16 hours a day. I don't know if there's one shift he's one lol

[3:36:22] davidlesan7: no one likes ruth
[3:36:24] TTUCROWN: @baldpanda360 I agree.  people play the game to have fun and have fun with their chat. what’s going to happen is they are going to run everyone off because they won’t want to put up with the BS
[3:36:28] BraerHZ: Ruth's RP is great but if she gets her way anyone RPing as an officer is going to burn out fast and hard
[3:36:29] lawlkat: @charminherman maybe cornwood will actually make the LASO happen instead of just talking about it
[3:36:36] TheBirdManHQ: @nick_cola86 i click off cornwoods stream a lot when he does a report which i feel like he does a lot
[3:36:37] rclemon_: @davidlesan7 i like ruth
[3:36:41] onlyicxrus: @limerick2018 Shift 2

[3:37:09] SoulYou_: was the issue of Ruth spying in PD car off duty addressed? KEKW
[3:37:10] ultramicdo: if you've seen enough ruth from different povs you realize she's great and start to like her
[3:37:11] dreggy69: play*
[3:37:12] BaldPanda360: @nick_cola86 yup. idk if you watch Cornwood a lot, but you can tell Andrews is starting to hate getting on. really like his IRL job now.
[3:37:18] charminherman: @lawlkat That would be great content
[3:37:20] GonBonkin: No pixel needs a chatgpt agent built in to write reports from shorthand descriptions LULW
[3:37:22] nick_cola86: @TheBirdManHQ right, i want more person to person interaction, less of this real-world paper pushing nonsense and punishment
[3:37:24] slomojosh: soulyou_ yeah it didn’t matter
[3:37:26] Ficktions: I think Ruth's got a good idea for some of her points. However, the limitations that officers have right now with equipment/vehicles/etc. make it hard to perform how she's wanting them to
[3:37:26] fellathedude: @spillatv yup
[3:37:28] Alpha___0_0: just make Cornwood  sherif KKona
[3:37:33] rclemon_: Dont start talking for other streamers plz

[3:37:39] lawlkat: I came in late. did they bring up ruth stalking her officers off duty?
[3:37:40] SageKingdom: cornwood asked for fto might be funny to see reaction if u talk about it
[3:37:48] TheBirdManHQ: @spillatv agree
[3:37:53] tinywulf: Slacks the teacher this gonna be good, he needs one of those old school hand pointers that he can wack the desk with.
[3:37:54] Ficktions: @lawlkat Yup! Pretty much just said she's allowed to do it
[3:37:55] MlCRO_: @lawlkat yes
[3:38:07] BaldPanda360: i told cornwood early, just use Speech to text in a notepad, copy paste to the report.
[3:38:07] complexlalo: @alpha___0_0 Cornwood is already captain he got promoted during the football game MiniK lmao

[3:38:25] Galactic_Tactics: happened to a crim I follow too

[3:39:29] Koll0: Okay anyone watching the police officers in action right now can thank ruth for the shitshow that just went down
[3:39:29] lawlkat: @Ficktions did turner or slacks say that this presents strong evidence to their claims that they're being targeted?
[3:39:29] GonBonkin: Didn't you guys just say you want people to sort their own issues?
[3:39:31] woolfdesign: its a joke homie

[3:41:18] IthoNic: KEEP DAPS for all, but there almost needs to be other roles that arent directly considered cops, but maybe more security officers, informants, and DAP reception that dont have as much power... but only for the greater good in accountability and efficiency with the whole situation.. just need to expand it to make it healthier, but that comes with more limits to all roles, so its tough.. not to mention how lawyers would interact @Ssaab

[11:40:11] magnets_: na i mean they were in there a bunch ramming cars around trying to scoop up the suspect
[11:40:57] TechToniic: Shoot tires max
[11:41:08] ParashootTV: @BiggieLOVDJazz The gym has been in the works for a year and a half almost. It's understandable that it's priority right now
[11:41:12] MrDher: @TechToniic Against SOP
[11:41:20] TechToniic: Ahhh, thanks
[11:41:33] Drkdream: they don't shoot tires
[11:41:37] Ned15: Was the SOP that you can hit people
[11:41:37] BiggieLOVDJazz: yeah that’s fair
[11:41:43] TechToniic: Yeah, makes sense
[11:41:46] Kaztiell: @Drkdream hopefully they can stop taht fast, it was even boring to watch from the crim side when ppl rescue eachother over and over
[11:41:49] slendom: warn them LUL ffs
[11:42:09] smashkan: They outskilled the tazer and the cuffs tbh
[11:42:12] AloofMango: Eat them EZ
[11:42:14] MisterParry: whenever an officer feels his life is in immediate danger and the only thing that can save lives is firing his gun, he is justified in doing so
[11:42:15] Ned15: Then they should have hit them for sure LUL
[11:42:18] succyogran: is he asking a admin or a pd captain ?
[11:42:22] leo_bwo: Cause they can what u mean?? they tazed him like 8 times he almost past out cause of it, broke cuffs countless times as well
[11:42:32] AloofMango: @succyogran captain
[11:42:37] Drkdream: They won't change the shooting tires prob tbh, right now sucks cus their cars are down bad, but later on they can keep up with better cars
[11:42:38] GunsmokeTV: the cuff was crazy
[11:42:42] eiyzen: tbh ray was 1hp and clutched up on those cuf mini games
[11:42:46] Squanchels: skill issue
[11:42:54] BiggieLOVDJazz: imagine prime Adrian Peterson crushing middle schoolers lol it’d be great
[11:42:57] GunsmokeTV: the cuffs were crazy fast
[11:42:58] eiyzen: 1 tackle and ray was dead
[11:43:07] GunsmokeTV: he was cracked
[11:43:11] ericmw: one of the guys did get tazed like 5 times, I couldn't believe he broke cuffs 3-4 times. that's hard right?
[11:43:28] MisterParry: yes
[11:43:32] magnets_: yeah i mean it's ray
[11:43:34] magnets_: he's goated
[11:43:37] TechToniic: Tom Brady lvl 99 awareness
[11:43:41] ericmw: kind of seemed like he earned it but I have no bias either way, it was an interesting scene
[11:43:46] eiyzen: yea ray clutched up I don’t think most people would do it 3 times
[11:43:46] Ned15: Well the SOP is to warn and hit the people with baton
[11:43:49] MisterParry: and he barely survived. He got out of there with about 1 Hp
[11:43:49] Jibry: ray is mechanically gifted
[11:44:14] cjohno20: cuffs have to be the way they are
[11:44:19] magnets_: yeah exactly
[11:44:20] Drkdream: HUH
[11:44:20] Nymsoft: It's real dumb atm
[11:44:21] Saxon217: @Jibry ray could uncuff with his eyes closed lol
[11:44:21] MrDher: KEKW
[11:44:22] slendom: breaking cuffs 3+ times is sweaty...
[11:44:23] succyogran: yhh
[11:44:26] Sebsrc02: move the suspect
[11:44:27] clowniusthe1st: X had a warrant
[11:44:29] silvershad0: the burden of skill was definitely on the crims in a situation like this
[11:44:36] ZerZom: they used fluffy cuffs
[11:44:38] modooc56: @Jibry its not even that hard lol
[11:44:41] magnets_: they coulda just car'd jp right away but mcnulty wanted to allow rp. not about w's and L's
[11:44:41] TechToniic: Shouldn't have chance to break cuffs every time
[11:44:42] Ned15: Not a bad idea
[11:44:45] leo_bwo: on the 5th cuff they cant brekk it but thats still alot of cuffs lol
[11:44:47] ericmw: I see lots of people cuffed the first time
[11:44:55] theancientones1: The cuffs should be buffed a lot
[11:44:58] Ned15: People wouldn't doubt themselves if they knew the scenarios
[11:45:02] MisterParry: the cuff mini-game should get progressively more difficult each time a crim breaks imo
[11:45:04] cjohno20: lots of headless chickens on scene
[11:45:12] Sebsrc02: get the suspect into the pd as fast as possible
[11:45:14] ericmw: I don't understand how Cornwood gets to shooting though, I mean other than his character will always say shoot because he's funny
[11:45:24] Snackboy898: @TechToniic at some point you cant break cuffs I think its like the 4th or 5th time its automatic cuff
[11:45:25] debacle_of_our_mullets: Make it so cuffing someone is a skill to get better at to?
[11:45:49] eiyzen: cuff with ping delay and lag is fair , don’t think much people could hit it 3 times like ra
[11:46:00] Sebsrc02: cuffs are fine, just extract the suspect as soon as you have them in cuffs
[11:46:14] hugz: lol
[11:46:17] slendom: its already like that
[11:46:19] ericmw: I don't see how cops could ever shoot in that situation when the crims never attacked a cop
[11:46:21] cjohno20: x got cuffed on first try. people don't remember when the crims fail cuffs
[11:46:22] StreamElements: Follow me on twitter to know when I go live and more! - https://twitter.com/SSaab45
[11:46:24] TechToniic: @snackboy898 in what timeframe, do you know?
[11:46:28] Buffedgiant15: no way someone needed to be shot in the situation. def beat down
[11:46:32] cjohno20: it's confirmation bias
[11:46:34] eiyzen: I think more should have tazered benji
[11:46:37] Drkdream: meow
[11:46:42] Kaztiell: its bad if only god gamers can break cuffs, but somehow it cant be too easy for god gamers either, its hard to fix
[11:46:43] slomojosh: meow
[11:46:45] ericmw: yeah beat down makes sense
[11:46:46] qats: needs to be harder the more times they succeed in breaking
[11:46:46] HAYNEZz: PettheCallie
[11:46:47] mitchgroulx1234: Meow
[11:47:01] Antaunik: @ericmw Vehicle ramming = deadly weapon, he is explaining it a bit different than when he asked turner
[11:47:03] TechToniic: Cause he was ramming at eyeball "30 mph"
[11:47:08] LazyAF: they will probably be able to lock pick the cuffs in the future so the cuffs can be hard
[11:47:10] slomojosh: BasedGod mods
[11:47:11] Ned15: Beat with a baton 100%
[11:47:12] Snackboy898: @TechToniic im not sure now but in 3.0 it was like if you cuff in like a 2-3 minute continous time frame the 5th cuff is an automatic cuff with no chance for the crim to break
[11:47:17] micfool: @qats it is currently
[11:47:18] jammer_fi: @qats it already gets faster when you get cuffed again
[11:47:22] TheLk7: Just woke up, surprised to see you’re both still awake
[11:47:36] Sebsrc02: It’s confirmation bias, they notice the one time someone breaks out of cuffs multiple times, but in the same situation they cuffed someone first time
[11:47:37] TechToniic: @snackboy898 thanks, appreciate info
[11:47:38] eiyzen: I think he just asking what to do to make the scene better which is fair, I think ray clutched up. if he failed that’s easy two arrests
[11:47:39] ericmw: @antaunik ah I see. from my perspective the vehicle was slow and never dangerous and once or twice. but if Cornwood feels like they were gonna kill him then maybe
[11:47:44] magnets_: yeah obviously putting jp into the car right away is "safest" but it allows better rp to let the situation breathe a lil

[11:48:17] clowniusthe1st: they take out guns, dont use them and get robbed
[11:48:19] ZerZom: cmon cornwood it was only one situation wait until you see crims with guns
[11:48:36] Antaunik: @ericmw From what I understood how he explained to turner, cornwood thought it was going to push cars into not just other officers but the suspect who was restrained on the other side of the car
[11:48:37] TheLk7: Are they doing a 24hr or just a late night?
[11:48:42] Jurgen___: when cornwood starts to doubt if he should shoot or not things are bad
[11:48:49] eiyzen: if the cops do excessive power for these small crimes, when guns come out it’s going to get wild
[11:48:49] Drkdream: if cornwood is not confident on pulling his gun, you know something is wrong saabKEK
[11:49:08] TechToniic: Right. No crims have guns. You could shoot in air and everyone would scatter.
[11:49:17] TechToniic: Not SOP I'm sure tho
[11:49:22] ericmw: @antaunik fair enough, that isn't what ended up happening though so it seemed unfounded. but it's not easy in the moment
[11:49:37] eiyzen: idk lol. cause when crims get guns it’s going to escalate
[11:49:44] clowniusthe1st: and the "i dont remember" defense
[11:49:54] clowniusthe1st: KEKW
[11:50:11] micfool: @Jurgen___ not really, because unlike 3.0 guns are very hard to come by currently, so  the use of gun is unnecessary most of the time tbh
[11:50:25] cjohno20: crims don't even have pistols yet. would kinda suck to jump the gun on escalation this early on
[11:50:26] mitchgroulx1234: Is that a clip of the capt meeting

[11:50:35] ser_ethan: i miss baas :(
[11:50:39] eiyzen: this wouldn’t be an issue if ray failed the mechanics
[11:50:53] Drkdream: most wanted arc monkaW
[11:51:15] ericmw: if you run that scenario 10 times the crim loses in 9 of them imho
[11:51:41] TechToniic: @ericmw exactly. Just take the L
[11:51:41] KUNComm: ^
[11:51:41] StreamElements: What they said saabThat
[11:51:42] eiyzen: @ericmw yeah for sure lol ray was 1hp as well
[11:51:43] OGprodigy: WeirdChamp
[11:51:53] Jibry: WeirdPaper
[11:51:58] alexskater5027: ray and benji mechanically played that perfectly to get X out. 99% of people all get caught in that situation
[11:52:10] Chaos_91: saabNom
[11:52:10] Urek808ph: It's not that deep - that's what she said
[11:52:10] Puk3s: Doing some of the more challenging situations would be interesting
[11:52:16] BiggieLOVDJazz: yeah ppl get strange quick lol
[11:52:20] OneManArmyh: But what if you modify cuffs. First time decently hard but the second time is really hard. So they cant just spam break cuffs
[11:52:23] TechToniic: Someone walk in plz
[11:52:25] AloofMango: Mechanically Nerd
[11:52:34] magnets_: it's not a ranked FPS game chat
[11:52:40] tim212_: I don’t see his issue?
[11:52:43] ericmw: if cops shoot there the crims lose 1000 out of 1000. though I get you can't base everything just on balance either
[11:52:46] KUNComm: @techtoniic Fr
[11:52:51] eiyzen: I think if more people tazered they would have won? no one got benji when he put x in the car
[11:52:56] Anonymousv8: @OneManArmyh it already is kinda like that
[11:53:09] alexskater5027: @AloofMango there are small mechanics that can make a big difference... always has been like that
[11:53:10] slomojosh: did they end up catching them?
[11:53:17] slomojosh: I missed this encounter
[11:53:19] OZZYROBBO: @slomojosh no
[11:53:22] hembloop: If thats the reasoning, Brandishing wouldnt be a crime
[11:53:23] cjohno20: it's good content if escapes are possible. Would suck if you just got shot down everytime
[11:53:26] eiyzen: @slomojosh they got away
[11:53:28] becoolone: ok MOD LUL
[11:53:28] magnets_: nope, active warrants out for benji and jp
[11:53:29] Sersha: @eiyzen won NotLikeThis
[11:53:30] slomojosh: peepoNotes
[11:53:30] KUNComm: Damn mods crazy here
[11:53:36] nebxhelix: Cops start shooting then crims will rob cops to shoot back... that crim mentality
[11:53:39] OneManArmyh: @Anonymousv8 I thought that its like easy at first then second break a bit harder and so on. So they can spam break like 3-4 times. Instead of it being more punishing if you miss the first break
[11:53:48] KUNComm: @becoolwan LUL
[11:53:55] magnets_: Chatting damn mods crazy here
[11:53:56] mitchgroulx1234: Watch meta chat

[11:54:29] MoistMouthMags: take your bets chat....will slacks die from hunger
[11:54:48] jack5mikemotown: federal trade comission?
[11:54:50] OneManArmyh: @Anonymousv8 Sure i know that but now it seems like they hit the first break they get cuffed again its still easy to break them right? It should be a bit harder after the first break i think
[11:54:57] AloofMango: @Ned15 curvyeHmm
[11:54:58] Drkdream: Federal Trade Commission saabKEK
[11:55:09] King_Rexy: @MoistMouthMags no he is going to pick up the food on the ground
[11:55:16] TrailerPark__: maybe devs can add like a limit allow crims 3 times to slip away from cuff
[11:55:29] jbombo: Wasn't as bad as he's making it seem..there was light bumping of cars and a crap load of tazing going on lol
[11:55:31] slomojosh: are Cornwoods cuffs still fucked?
[11:55:35] Leezus7: FTRP
[11:55:44] ashadee63: @trailerpark__ That is already implemented
[11:55:45] eiyzen: @trailerpark__ that might work but the mini game still good
[11:55:45] AloofMango: @TrailerPark__ there already is
[11:55:47] Jibry: @TrailerPark__ you get only 4 attempts to break. 5th is sinta cuffed
[11:55:56] alexskater5027: @TrailerPark__ there is a limit its 5 rn, and ray was 1hp from the tazers. if anyone touched him more he woulda went down. it was close af
[11:55:58] tim212_: @trailerpark__ there is one it’s 4
[11:56:00] TechToniic: Cornwood using toy cuffs lol
[11:56:02] Anonymousv8: @OneManArmyh it is a little harder and keep getting harder

[11:59:32] criquetRL: Cornwood BigDog
[11:59:36] ericmw: it was a fun scenario that could have gone either way, I'd be satisfied if the cops arrested the guy but it was also fun to see them miraculously beat the odds
[11:59:39] mitchgroulx1234: He not in the shower this time
[11:59:42] westkous: @micfool except esfand and 1-2 other cops all are top tier cops  agree
[11:59:42] aniquilattion: so cornwood is promoted?
[11:59:56] Chaos_91: slacks is starving

[12:01:00] wolfgang_86: True
[12:01:04] katerade38: yuppp
[12:01:07] alexskater5027: agree well said
[12:01:17] Chaos_91: makes sense
[12:01:17] magnets_: chat needs to remember that there are people who have been rp'ing crim mechanics for 4 years
[12:01:17] aniquilattion: you can do if they break cuffs 3 times u best them down
[12:01:17] H00TYWH0: Maybe an escalation after breaking cuffs after x amount of times
[12:01:18] criquetRL: NODDERS
[12:01:19] micfool: it really make sense that best crim are hard to catch
[12:01:22] Blokeowski: 100% agreed :D
[12:01:23] shady_malik: society should be designed for the dumbest people
[12:01:23] AnthonyStevens: Doesn't matter how hard you make it, someone will always find the way to bust it.

[12:01:43] katerade38: hell ya TwitchUnity TwitchUnity
[12:01:44] driver1036: so was captain slacks close to making a move earlier on the bridge?  what was he thinking
[12:01:46] Omerhur: there's no W or L, it's RP, either outcome enhances the storylines and this whole thing is like a TV show. people need to stop taking it so damn seriously
[12:01:47] ososo: yeah
[12:01:48] lookingfornothinghere: Yeah but you also shouldnt make PD have to warn people 30times
[12:01:49] ijoefromearth: saabHype
[12:01:50] mitchgroulx1234: Ur best at rp all cops r great
[12:01:52] westkous: there are well trained cops and there are cops sitting in the car, or spike not moving cars. same goes for criminals. LUL
[12:01:55] rclemon_: NAH ALWAYS GO FOR THE W ReallyMad
[12:01:56] alexskater5027: if cops win everytime its boring af

[12:01:59] wolfgang_86: I really enjoy the lack of guns also i will miss that in the future
[12:02:04] ELEGlGGLE: NAH ALWAYS GO FOR THE W ReallyMad
[12:02:08] King_Rexy: NODDERS
[12:02:15] fixer_18: The rules aren't the issue. Officers were just stunnded and didn't know how to respond. First crazy scenario for them in 4.0
[12:02:16] jack5mikemotown: crminals a good interaction matters more cause they only have one chance, if a crim get s away you guys get to go after another. losses hit way harder for them
[12:02:17] nightdivas: yea i agree
[12:02:18] Blokeowski: I love the way the PD is structured :D
[12:02:29] machineYearning: I also get where cornwood is coming from, it also seems a bit silly to sit there showing restraint while they're ramming with 2 ton automobiles and putting officer safety in danger
[12:02:33] LazyAF: but those really good crims start to snowball then in 6 months there is only 3 gangs in the city that everyone is a part of
[12:02:34] TechToniic: Some mech should be chance instead of skill. Like 4 cuffs in a row is frustrating
[12:02:46] magnets_: this was also the first crazy crim pick up scenario of 4.0
[12:02:50] MoistMouthMags: @Ssaab do you think the devs could add in some blank/paint ammo for the pistols for the training/fieldtrips?
[12:02:53] katerade38: fanfClap fanfClap fanfClap fanfClap
[12:02:58] mitchgroulx1234: And lay out of places
[12:02:59] alexskater5027: yea i think cops were more unprepared for the scenario vs benji ray and X have escaped 1000 times from ridiculious scenarious
[12:03:00] aniquilattion: you can do if they break cuffs 3 times u beat them down! @ssaab
[12:03:02] Bill_Collector: Punishing folks for being good at the mechanics is tough
[12:03:03] zzayf: WhatDoYouMeanByThat
[12:03:04] quote_me_if_horsen: i feel using cop car to block the suspect is super important
[12:03:04] fixer_18: Yea training will fix it in my opinion
[12:03:08] ericmw: wait someone was spiking unmoving cars? I didn't see that
[12:03:10] Eddie1225: idc
[12:03:14] Eddie1225: bring back magdump season
[12:03:16] Darj: the result was a coinflip anyway and a good chance for PD to learn and improve SOP, and also resulted in some amazing RP on both sides
[12:03:19] Eddie1225: Kappa
[12:03:27] Sh4rkill3r: just because a criminal escape is not an L for the cop. all the content in the chase is a W. some push the jail rp too much
[12:03:29] ELEGlGGLE: BREACH SEASON AINTNOWAY
[12:03:31] slendom: 'warn them' is extremely pushover
[12:03:31] magnets_: if you design sops around ray and benji's mechanics then no other crim would get away
[12:03:32] Omerhur: @machineYearning when i played GTA:SAMP on an RP server, if repeated the offenders would get an admin jail time for "cop baiting" etc. it wasn't perfect, but that's the thing. you want RP, you don't want to be the keeper of a kindergarten
[12:03:35] Drkdream: dam right Eddie KKona
[12:03:39] westkous: how long does a warrant last in 4.0?
[12:03:40] ericmw: magdump season one week, hell week the next, we can just alternate
