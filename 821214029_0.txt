[2:13:43] Kreiger: Would you look for the same people on post-wipe Siz? Julio/huck/Zelda/etc
[2:13:44] boolove: yeah that's the problem
[2:13:44] zantoch_: @reposaurus yes right after nook
[2:13:46] WYF_NA: In 2.0 people were supposed to forget everything before the wipe. People still had their characters, and permas were undone
[2:13:46] DRspector: gotta play a pachinko machine
[2:13:46] glennuendo: shooting of course
[2:13:46] 420thMagicMan: If the wipe is in January, would Siz still b fat or will the story b refreshed?
[2:13:47] Tuckerbonage: @uberhaxornova if its a total wipe would it be HOA legal route actually working with the cops?
[2:13:50] jimboslimbotime: twitch wipe
[2:13:50] dillpickle876: wasn't there already a full wipe ?
[2:13:51] zantoch_: boom*

[2:14:25] tombovard: @junglemints uhnHug
[2:14:28] Zaaltyr: there should be a way for people to takeover whitelist, but they'd have to earn it and have RP reasoning for wanting and ways to progress it. imo
[2:14:29] husstruss123: @JazzThaKid yeyeh still pretty dope
[2:14:29] theimplications: Chat I doubt its a memory wipe. The HOA has the tavern. CG has the museum. Its probably just bank accounts and vehicles
[2:14:31] bashuu128: kill the whitelister to take the whitelist

[2:14:46] Pinkhoney: I don't think they are doing a full wipe because alot of people have stuff coming in 3.0, from what i remember Nikez saying the taxes will be really high so it will drain peoples money
[2:14:49] tombovard: the police have been neutered for a year now Sadge

[2:15:47] tombovard: coke drops Sadge

[6:03:03] Donkeyshspittle: @UberHaxorNova some of my faovrite games ever are pretty hsort games
[6:03:04] colossalwreck: The person who said 175 hours is a playtester who tests for bugs guys. He literally spent hours trying to break the game, not beat it
[6:03:05] Lnfamouskaos: BuT BiGgER iS BeTtER Kappa
[6:03:06] LookAtThisTeam: Quality over quantaty

[6:03:09] FriedKhoi: NODDERS too long
[6:03:09] PunkkRatt: It makes it appealing to people who only get a game every so often and wanna make sure the games last tbh

[6:03:54] CannibalPuppies: @giiiiiinger same but it has to be refreshing new content, not just recycled garbage
[6:03:54] MroweTv: he just wants sponsorships
[6:03:55] Krypt1kKhaos: shit, 24 is long for me. I like bite sized games
[6:03:55] colossalwreck: They said it will be shorter than witcher 3 since they said less people than they wanted to finish it
[6:03:55] SacarioE: I watched you play some of valhalla and uninstalled it. lol
[6:03:55] RedtwoSB: it's like a good high quality meal over a mediocre buffet

[6:05:16] CarolusRex521: @uberhaxornova long games are a acquired taste to be fair

[6:05:20] ForeheadSkin: @ShawnD__ Really? im the exact opposite, the online is hard to get into. The single player story is great though once you get into it all
[6:05:21] theroyalblitz: @ForeheadSkin I totally disagree. Everything after Rhodes was a drag. It's just the same story arc over and over

[6:05:40] RedtwoSB: mama j with long hair looks nice
[6:05:48] colossalwreck: God of war (2018) was a good length
[6:05:50] ForeheadSkin: @theroyalblitz I can see that opinion, but to me it was about the character development rather than paying attention to all of their escapades.
[6:05:51] giiiiiinger: @Pointblankop13 It was a good game and story
