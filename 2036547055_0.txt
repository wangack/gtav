[0:20:17] Artsii1994: no
[0:20:19] Angel_ofMercy: no
[0:20:21] Juvraj: there is a machine in armory for fingerprints
[0:20:22] YoYo49111: its a marking
[0:20:24] KillerKolsch: fingerprints are skin oil
[0:20:25] itsElevatedd: fingerprint i heard

[0:20:27] Moobot: Thanks for subbing, RoninGundam! Welcome to the Saabscribers! saabH
[0:20:28] areolagrande__: they said skin cell residue i think?
[0:20:29] limerick2018: What if they were gloves and rp it out
[0:20:30] CuBanMumzy: no dna is usually from fluids or skin cells
[0:20:39] areolagrande__: when they throw it/dispose of the item

[0:20:40] CuBanMumzy: fingerprints are fingerprints

[0:20:44] debacle_of_our_mullets: Get Cornwood to fix some furniture LUL
[0:20:51] KillerKolsch: yep
[0:20:51] madman2233: they tested it today after the meeting, throwing from backpack does not work, but otherwise dropping stuff does work

[0:20:54] Valkner12: yes
[0:20:55] Yidz: and ruth said theres dead skin cells from the fingerprint
[0:20:58] Angel_ofMercy: no
[0:20:59] Artsii1994: Yes
[0:20:59] Krimson07_: its a print of your finger LUL
[0:21:04] psylongti: Pattern of swords on your finger
[0:21:05] BackStageDoor: nope
[0:21:09] sonadapop: It has been proven that DNA can be obtained even from a single fingerprint. However, there are several problems linked to a fingerprint sample as DNA source. One of the main problems associated with fingerprints is that only 30-35 % of fingerprints have been successfully amplified and typed.
[0:21:11] psylongti: Sworls
[0:21:12] JC_Lewis: Fingerprints are an oil pattern but your PD database matches prints to DNA anyway
[0:21:12] sonadapop: according to google
[0:21:14] 4win: pattern on your fingers
[0:21:19] Wandering_Ranger: no. Fingerprints are just unique to every individual so work similarly to dna
[0:21:19] areolagrande__: i'd guess leftover skincells are DNA by extention
[0:21:20] HagFaerie: fingerprints are just prints, if it had remnants of the skin cells then you could say DNA i think
[0:21:25] BulletENIGMA: just a marking. like using ink to take fingerprints of crims
[0:21:27] spennys: its a videogame
[0:21:27] anoobmove_twitch: i would think it would think it would be fingerprints. on items and dna if somebody is stabbed xdd
[0:21:30] JC_Lewis: you take both prints and swabs down at the lab anyway right?
[0:21:37] ms_INDER: no
[0:21:40] PeteSoSleepy: INB4 all the cars slacks want are sold out still
[0:21:40] BulletGorilla: you actually leave both

[6:58:07] BakinPacman: dirty money does not matter here tbh
[6:58:11] BakinPacman: its still cash
[6:58:41] Vorpalwarp: dirty money is vernacular to begin with
[6:58:53] ragner7488: its marked bills
[6:59:09] BakinPacman: rolled cash is not marked persay
[6:59:24] BakinPacman: its like having many 1 dollar bills
[6:59:43] BakinPacman: its suspiscious but not like a marked bill from a bank
[7:00:18] Sigfred42: Isn't this the same problem that kept arising over rolled bills in 3.0 and proving it was for drugs?
[7:00:20] bigg504: lays
[7:00:44] BakinPacman: the bills are not illegal in that sense
[7:01:00] brownsugarbiscuit: yea this rolled bills thing is such a headache
[7:01:14] BakinPacman: the only reason for seizing cash is because it can be inferred they got it from illegal actions
[7:01:21] Omerhur: might have to code in a "dirty money" item that works the same as regular money, but obviously can help out the PD identify crime.. and i'm guessing this would also help out a "laundering" system take place.. i used to play with a system like that and it was great in SA:MP both as a LEO and as a mafia boss
[7:01:21] BakinPacman: it does not make that cash itself illegal
[7:01:54] brownsugarbiscuit: thats exactly what exists omerhur
[7:02:13] Omerhur: @brownsugarbiscuit oh does it?
[7:02:17] InvictoNZ: dirty money is cash that has a known serial number before it was stolen and then recovered - cash from a handoff is just cash
[7:02:20] brownsugarbiscuit: yea that is what they are talking about
[7:02:34] dakota22446: saabOwo WineTime

[7:05:59] dakota22446: pleep
[7:07:00] BakinPacman: the rolled money is basically there as a way to generate a reasoning of why this might be illegal.
[7:07:33] ForgottenJones: NODDERS
[7:07:44] ForgottenJones: you need a link
[7:07:52] BakinPacman: yeah i can see it being a case of rolled cash may be seized on conviction.
[7:07:57] BakinPacman: and stored until concluded
[7:08:00] meeto_tv: do yall currently have alot of reports of rolled up money linking it to illegal dealings?
[7:09:24] charybdes: IRL - If a drug dealer is caught with drugs his money is taken, if he has a large amount his property's can be searched including seizing his bank accounts.
[7:09:27] BakinPacman: did mcnulty ask them to stop is the only thing that would change anything
[7:10:15] BakinPacman: if they try to leave after that point then its their own fault LUL

[7:13:40] budogorilla: Rolled cash alone should never be a charge by itself, only when accompanied by a crime and other proceeds of crime. More realistic that way, makes more sense
