[5:47:09] Linconi: you playing animal crossing at all?
[5:47:16] OneLegitTrue: @UberHaxorNova i don't think moneybags matter, i think it's all separate if Ian only getting 5.1k
[5:47:19] Tweker: he was at 8.1
[5:47:23] theimplications: uhnSun
[5:47:24] defective_candy: What was Ian‚Äôs rep?

[5:47:35] haramchampion: 8.1 2 days ago
[5:47:38] haramchampion: or 3

[5:47:59] Deadnoz: @ImSammers i gues si wasnt around for the exact numbers, im just going based on what i heard
[5:48:03] OneLegitTrue: @ShimazuRyozo so he got 5k with the bands?
[5:48:08] ununseptium117: that would be an expensive chance by planting drugs on them
[5:48:19] imSammers: @Deadnoz ah gotcha
[5:48:21] suspectk: Unless you fun it to him, like for all they know he's doing taco runs
[5:48:31] Tacoria1: maybe you handle the business of buying the bands instead of ian
[5:48:33] staticburst: how often does ian get taken hostage? KEKW @UberHaxorNova
[5:48:42] deadrise123akahashiramav1: @uberhaxornova don‚Äôt you think Wayne deserves to know about the box?
[5:48:49] Buzzabeel: planting drugs on ian and expecting no backlash KEKW
[5:48:55] DarthCheesus: Siz just be the middle man for Ian so he stays anonymous.
[5:48:58] DSrlaagyoenr: Just wait till Jordan Steele is back in the city, i feel like hell cause some chaos at the shop LUL
[5:48:59] esrou: Also only a few people know what the box is even less what is inside
[5:49:06] OneLegitTrue: @ShimazuRyozo if so, then Rep is all separate, for cooks, reg delivery, bands, and moneybags all separate
[5:49:08] TrigginFypo: @deadrise123akahashiramav1 he will find out when siz is max rep

[5:49:15] Delaantje98: I thought you had some moneybags since you tested it with them
[5:49:18] DarkLord1366: Also Ian is a civ so the police would probably believe him if he said stuff was planted on him
[5:49:22] pepsiplunge19: @deadrise123akahashiramav1 Hes gonna tell Wayne when his rep is max
[5:49:24] DovaLink: Give him an outfit

[5:50:03] DovaLink: Or a code name like moneybags or some shit
[5:50:10] OneLegitTrue: @UberHaxorNova if Ian only got 5k on bands, then rep is different for each job
[5:50:12] monster343: Really just gotta be careful of people like Sonya who would go after anyone associated with the shop
[5:50:22] gbellaphoenix: you guys may need to make a deal with dexx to protect ian
[5:50:23] PyromaniacJoe: uhnKek
[5:50:45] imdeatht1: Ian is well known enough to not be used as a hostage
[5:50:54] suspectk: actually that would make sense, just have dexx cover him. Just have him claim him as his guy
[5:50:57] OneLegitTrue: @UberHaxorNova so yea database for all the jobs so they can keep getting rep doing what they do and make more for their jobs
[5:51:02] suspectk: pay extra to dex?
[5:51:02] imSammers: @gbellaphoenix i dont think any deal really needs to be made, but tellin dex that his boys shouldnt stop ian is a good idea
