[6:59:04] fishtower404tv: I would probably be a feeder in that game LUL
[6:59:05] Gravity16: @EagleCore what about the league balance, do new players play new players in the low league after placements or is it a smurf fest?
[6:59:30] FilapTV: twitch and fiddle need to teamfight, and jhin split
[6:59:32] JackHardmode: @fishtower404tv idk these terms but im here to learnHmm
[6:59:39] EagleCore: before ranked as long as you dont play with other high level accounts you should be with newer players @Gravity16
[6:59:55] EagleCore: they have ok smurf detection

[7:00:53] fishtower404tv: I don't know the terms too well, but in other games, a feeder is when you get killed all the time and feed currency to the enemy as a result, so that they can upgrade faster
