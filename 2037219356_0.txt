[4:35:10] KirkHasselen: does the trucks cost the same?
[4:35:24] TheGlobGoblin: or grime you mean?
[4:35:33] GrumpyMark01: Maybe the different badge level might be needed for future heist?
[4:35:35] minnmor: its different now so might be bit more interesting to go if you get the big truck
[4:35:38] Givesumjuice: Mabe that's the way people can open vualt doors by robing the badges
[4:35:40] Crazith: my office used our badges as a key for doors so could be something? maybe?
[4:35:41] TheGlobGoblin: ooo maybe you get more money
[4:35:45] TheGlobGoblin: ahhhhh
[4:36:04] Bruvverbean: third truck went from 1400 to 2800
[4:36:06] TheGlobGoblin: Deez will be up good LUL
[4:36:08] traviebear: Higher payout with bigger trucks makes it worth it more.
[4:36:25] stridro: wonder if you ask lvl 1 see what their payout is for contract
[4:36:25] EternitysRaven: I wonder if the actual runs are different and if we will need to retime them
[4:36:31] Fennomania: If there's cooldown that means the other cars won't be useless
[4:36:34] VoidedZReaper: so now you potentially really need all 3 if the top ones on cool down for a while then you can only do the middle one
[4:36:39] Swarles_: why?
[4:36:43] TheGlobGoblin: Did you have to buy the badge? @NikkisARiot
[4:36:45] MAZM0L: you become a bigger target

[6:02:18] Chritters: Yeah, I think that might just be bad luck.
[6:02:24] BennieThePlant: You had 2 identical tier 2 jobs so I think it might have been a mishap
[6:02:26] warlord2k8: maybe they refresh every min or 2?
