[1:27:14] MsKatiie: is the motive not at all relevant evidence?
[1:27:33] BakinPacman: PD needs these x questions answered for public clarity
[1:28:11] ru1000: So JP has a clear motive
[1:28:42] thylootgoblin: he probably did it
[1:28:44] thylootgoblin: lmfao

[1:45:51] CouchCouchen: @FilzG I don't mind, but my rent might
[1:45:54] HavocusRex: lmao 100% gotta be duncan
[1:45:55] xTurqeh: Duncan
[1:45:58] random_viewer_55: @FilzG he would get +4 DAPs if he wouldn't be fired.
[1:45:58] shlbainu: Duncaning
[1:46:10] buuutty: not according to slacks he said if cops are caught lying it dont matter their rank

[1:46:14] FilzG: @CouchCouchen yeah the job itself is fuck it, youll get a new one, its the adulting that sucks
[1:46:15] nox503: towCopium could be anyone chat
[1:46:17] ItsEdBoi_: Maybe I dont really think it matters ppo vs officer, they were originally gonna do 5 daps with a suspension but fired him after the convo
[1:46:19] BakinPacman: YEah you have already made up your mind at that point
[1:46:26] FilzG: @random_viewer_55 this
[1:46:33] magnets_: PPO doesn‚Äôt mean *on* probation. it means you‚Äôre kept a close eye on and are still being trained
[1:46:53] shlbainu: If Duncan talked to a captain about that, he'd get punished
[1:47:02] CouchCouchen: @FilzG I deserve a better job. I'm one of the only ones that paid taxes, ya know? Anyway...
[1:47:10] FilzG: @magnets_ they RP as in probabtion, in LS laws there's actually no law that states that
[1:47:13] inaudiblecone: i feel katecSleep  gn everyone
[1:47:29] dingothe1st: If you cant handle the heat get out of the kitchen
[1:47:33] random_viewer_55: @magnets_ yeah, but you still get fired more easily. To get indefinite suspension when you are officer+ you need 10 DAPs but if you are PPO only 5 DAPs get you the indefinite suspension
[1:47:33] ItsEdBoi_: If anything PPOs should be given more rope as they arent expected to know everything perfectly
[1:47:39] FilzG: @CouchCouchen you'll get one soon brother, don't worry, rooting for ya!
[1:47:53] FilzG: @random_viewer_55 ^
[1:47:57] CouchCouchen: @FilzG rooting for you too bub
[1:48:03] lordgarty: I would off put in a track he didn't start the fire Tim lol
[1:48:04] CouchCouchen: or sis
[1:48:09] magnets_: yeah but he wasn‚Äôt fired for a daps number, he was fired for lying. a full officer woulda been fired for the same thing
[1:48:13] FilzG: @CouchCouchen brother ahah

[1:48:40] CouchCouchen: @FilzG ><
[1:49:10] random_viewer_55: @ItsEdBoi_ they are and they are not. They don't get blamed for some mistakes that would get full officers DAPed but at the same time they get indefinitely suspended more easily
[1:49:41] random_viewer_55: @magnets_ yeah probably. Or at the minimum demoted
[1:49:44] FilzG: i feel like they need to promote someone else to captain, it's not their fault but IRL they're dealing with shit that makes them not able to work the hours necessary to be a captain
[1:49:51] CouchCouchen: @FilzG rooting for you too

[1:52:50] FilzG: Kappa
[1:52:51] ItsEdBoi_: @NoahS116 kinda, it was "fast-track" they were marked as PPO but needed to be lowered to cadet just to be able to write FTO reports on them
[1:53:01] dingothe1st: Thats why i lurk in chats 90% percent of the time. I dont like the toxicity
[1:53:09] Lepaca: civ sees everything timmacS

[1:53:59] lordgarty: Listen timmac has skin like a rhino he is the biggest troll going ask him about cirkawit board lol
[1:54:03] dingothe1st: Ive watched LK for 6+ years so i just tune it out at this point or close the chat
[1:54:12] BakinPacman: wtf
[1:54:15] BakinPacman: LUL
[1:54:16] NoahS116: @itsedboi_ yeah I know that. what I‚Äôm saying is in theory, I think turner intended for McMahon to be processed quicker and have his 30 days start right away. he was never supposed to be a cadet
[1:54:17] TXCVulture: well jaywalking legal soo
[1:54:29] ItsEdBoi_: @NoahS116 yea for sure
[1:54:39] BakinPacman: KEKW
[1:54:45] FilzG: @NoahS116 but turner has been going through irl stuff so can't really be on top of that lately
[1:54:46] dingothe1st: But i watch alot of otger people when hes off
[1:54:54] dingothe1st: Other*

[1:55:56] FilzG: @ItsEdBoi_ ruby please, no?
[1:55:57] xTurqeh: @Sahil6255 like 220 or something like that

[1:56:16] ItsEdBoi_: @ItsEdBoi_ what shift is turner supposed to be?
[1:56:23] xTurqeh: @ItsEdBoi_ it'd have to be a shift 3 person
[1:56:24] random_viewer_55: @ItsEdBoi_ this one
[1:56:26] dingothe1st: @filzg if it isnt mr k i watch alot of cops too.
[1:56:32] FilzG: @ItsEdBoi_ hmm not sure, 3 i think?
[1:56:34] niw18: @BakinPacman how new law is that is true
[1:57:22] ItsEdBoi_: @ItsEdBoi_ Yea so it would need to be a shift 3 senior
[1:57:22] BakinPacman: @niw18 yeah its something about blocking traffic being a danger to the people you block LUL
[1:57:27] Azzarill: he's on pal / freeway
[1:57:58] xTurqeh: @ItsEdBoi_ fortunetly shift 3 is slow so they dont really need to promote someone
[1:58:35] FilzG: or maybe give seniors more power
[1:58:44] FilzG: of decision making
[1:59:09] ItsEdBoi_: @ItsEdBoi_ Except it puts a toll on slacks who needs to cover both
[1:59:13] FilzG: but interim captain would be better
[1:59:19] dingothe1st: @filzg im just curious what you mean by that
[1:59:39] FilzG: @dingothe1st by having a new captain?
[2:00:06] BigglesVII: At somepoint one of the capts will become chieft and a senior or two will be promoted.
[2:00:06] dingothe1st: Oh i thought you meant put more work on the current ones
[2:00:27] FilzG: its because I feel captains (except slacks) are goiing through IRL stuff lately and dont have time to actually be a captain
[2:00:38] FilzG: which makes slacks go overtime

[2:04:43] K00PAD00P: WICKED
[2:04:53] dingothe1st: @filzg i agree it just takes alittle time so its probably being talked about. Like lil texas pd as  a branch is probably behind the scenes a little as well as some roleplay to bring more cops and captians

[4:23:08] ilikethiccanimethighs: cuhh
[4:23:10] Lucasp6969: That all he knows to say is cuhh
[4:23:11] BakinPacman: they could be a fake hostage
[4:23:18] Pulveriser1: Just make him an accessory to the crimes he was the 'victim' of. That would be funny if you could get him charged successfully for it.

[4:23:42] THE6THtv: @Mui5hond stop, it's RP

[4:59:18] HavocusRex: I think in terms of US law the victim doesn‚Äôt have to provide id, the cops will take it if they‚Äôre unconscious or something.
[4:59:43] Famiglia__: disorderly too?
[4:59:47] HavocusRex: there is a stop and identify law in some states, but that is crime related only
[5:00:07] Vikairius: They were verbally detained for Investigation. So they can lawfully request ID
[5:00:08] deanb___: @HavocusRex in rp its different
[5:00:14] steez_irwin: is that ruth in front?
[5:00:30] Daddy__Winston: @deanb___ its not unless stated in los santos law
[5:00:43] HavocusRex: ^
[5:00:48] PoppinMastro: but the passenger of a vehicle doesn't have to ID right
[5:00:55] Zilinity: @havocusrex there are some states to where Stop and I‚Äôd is a thing. but some states added there has to be reasonable suspicion of a crime that they are about to, have, or already done a crime.

[5:01:23] deanb___: @deanb___ talking to the victim it is considered dteainment, i believe, could be wrong, but in detainment yu have to id yourself corectly
[5:01:53] crazyredneck118538: by the law the passenger has the right to tell u  know to showing u hjis id
[5:02:04] fluffycartel: It's gonna be fun when both groups are in prison together lol
[5:02:38] HavocusRex: the main point is that its enough of a grey area there needs to be los santos legislation on it
[5:02:57] deanb___: @HavocusRex im pretty sure there is though

[5:03:06] oofles_sadface: any financial investigation today?
[5:03:09] Daddy__Winston: @deanb___ only way an officer can demand ID is having PC of a crime being committed, has been committed, or going to be commited.
[5:03:16] Vikairius: Crane would 100% say it was a lawful order
[5:03:51] Phantroneous: Even more than that don't you need to ID them to make sure they are the people who were being held up?
[5:04:36] Vikairius: If they gave false information for the investigation it would lead to falsified information in the case and obstruct justice
[5:04:49] oofles_sadface: i just got here did you play any gomer today?
[5:04:51] Vikairius: That's why the ID is needed
[5:05:58] Daddy__Winston: @Vikairius it was a lawful order based on what tho. you cant just give lawful orders because you want to. civil rights trumps officer discression every time. you have to have criminal PC that can pr proven.

[5:11:42] Zilinity: RP law is similar but not exact actual US law. as Yk‚Ä¶. it‚Äôs a video game and very limited of what you can/not to
[5:11:43] ThePebbleGod: KEKW
[5:11:52] Zilinity: do*
[5:12:00] xXxEV0xXx: @Daddy__Winston Right? If anything, Mac started it by saying, ".. see you on the outside." The crim just replied back by agreeing with him.. :p
[5:12:25] xXxEV0xXx: mac gonna smoke him if he sees him back on the streets, cuh.
[5:12:42] deanb___: yeah, they were detained, have to id
[5:12:43] donsinkey: @johnnytwotimed oh i know, i was just countering his irl law with other irl u.s.a laws.
[5:12:48] adshotta: cops wouldnt id they would shoot KKonaW

[5:13:43] Vikairius: Crane, Lenny, and Frost are the shooters
[5:14:05] BakinPacman: this comes to fake paltes too if they come in the future
[5:14:10] BakinPacman: plates*

[5:14:31] Vikairius: The mask law is being pushed and might be in place after tonight
[5:14:31] deanb___: @Vikairius corn, recetnly, has been more bite than before
[5:14:35] BakinPacman: if they are in a government building or detained iirc
[5:14:43] SailorWS: ego?
[5:14:44] BakinPacman: check the bill
[5:14:51] deanb___: in govt buildining you have to remove mask or leave'

[5:16:24] xXxEV0xXx: Jesus Mac, why your taxes so high! Need more predictions to be able to afford that ish! lol
[5:16:25] Vikairius: @xxxev0xxx unsure why tbh, I think it's more a concern of escalation in the city.
[5:16:28] splooshtasticals: Obviously want to screw u over somehow
[5:16:29] donsinkey: @Timmac i know brother i came in at that part... i was just using irl counters to his irl points... no point using irl logic when we are talking ingame laws... so i was countering them using irl laws with other irl laws.
[5:16:57] xXxEV0xXx: Guess im stuck with Lurker Tax. :p
[5:17:29] donsinkey: oh you had full rights to id them.
[5:17:30] HavocusRex: innocents wouldnt mind giving up their id, it would be such a rare thing
[5:17:34] xXxEV0xXx: Hail.
[5:18:03] Azzarill: I wish you seen him put stuff in the bush he was next to lol
[5:18:13] StreamElements: SingsNote You can trigger audio alerts by cheering specific amounts of Bits in chat! List of sounds & values: https://imgur.com/a/Ew4C2QU SingsNote
[5:18:13] HavocusRex: it seems like police still need rs to require an id, maybe in this situation the hostages could argue what was the rs to demand id
[5:18:35] splooshtasticals: The demeanor alone set of the red flags 4 sure. All these new heads glorifying their RP was odd timing too.
[5:18:42] Vikairius: They were in a domestic dispute
[5:19:07] HavocusRex: yeah I think if you can articulate rs it‚Äôs justified
[5:19:13] Zilinity: damn. San Antonio got hit by a 4.3 earthquake
[5:19:17] deanb___: @HavocusRex i dont want to seem like a broken record, but, detainment equals need to id yourself
[5:19:21] fluffycartel: I'm still a little thrown off over the skinhead statement
[5:19:37] Vyzible: @Zilinity wait for real?
[5:19:56] donsinkey: going by what flop says they where "whitnesses" so no rs needed if they where whitnesses.
[5:20:16] Zilinity: @vyzible update actually. 4.7
[5:20:17] PGMuNrOe: They were involved in a crime. Police need to identify all those involved in a crime.
[5:20:27] sourdoughcookies: youd want to id witnesses for the same reason flop just said
[5:20:31] sourdoughcookies: to call back if it goes to trial
[5:20:36] caughtereyes: @deanb___  to be detained you have to have broken a law....
[5:20:41] Vyzible: @Zilinity damn i hope people are alright
[5:20:53] Vikairius: Untrue @caughtereyes
[5:20:56] deanb___: i dont think it needs to go farther than, you where a victim, you are being detained, you have to id yourself
[5:21:04] deanb___: victims can be detained
[5:21:11] BakinPacman: you specifically dont have to break the law

[5:21:13] Lepaca: google lawyers out in full force LUL
[5:21:14] sickayou: you just need RS to be detained, you dont need to have broken a crime
[5:21:21] BakinPacman: the police can detain anyone apart of the situation
[5:21:33] fluffycartel: No detainment is if anyone was involved in a situation all parties are held during active investigation
[5:21:40] TheGrayK: @caughtereyes No To be arrested you need to have been suspected of breaking a law you can be detained for many other reasons
[5:21:48] Vikairius: You have to break a law to be arrested though
[5:21:56] BakinPacman: ok ill charge your electronic account PepeLaugh
[5:22:03] splooshtasticals: @Lepaca funny how none of that works here though LUL
[5:22:06] Zilinity: @vyzible origin of the quake was Falls City
[5:22:07] illegitemi: @Vikairius NO YOU CAN BE ARRESSTED ON SUSPICIAN OF DOING SOMETHING
[5:22:13] illegitemi: scuse caps
[5:22:20] donsinkey: also rs being they where in the area of a crime as it happened so they have the rs to at least detain for questioning.
[5:22:23] deanb___: to be arrested you have to break a crime to be detained is different
[5:22:29] Atrociousnes: detained on sus sure
[5:22:32] illegitemi: probasble cause is a suspician, you think its happened
[5:22:35] Zilinity: I‚Äôm waiting for Cali to have another quake. feeling that 5.3 last year was kinda nuts
[5:22:37] Atrociousnes: but not arrested
[5:22:41] caughtereyes: @thegrayk true. They don't need to help the investigation though.
[5:22:52] BakinPacman: you can be cuffed on detainment but not arrested
[5:23:11] sourdoughcookies: that car needs to be parked to get rid of the ghost horn
[5:23:18] IsetfireIzetfire: is this your final clearance for liam?
[5:23:30] illegitemi: its literally you think they have done it, you have enough information that they might have done it == suspician by definition
[5:23:47] splooshtasticals: @Zilinity had a 5.0 in cali not too long ago in my area
[5:24:03] Vyzible: @Zilinity i hope yall dont have more quakes
[5:24:05] deanb___: i liked the second guy though he was just riding with his bro
[5:24:06] Phantroneous: Honestly If a witness says x person was being held up you need to confirm that the victims on scene are the people that the witness said were being held up. There might be more than one instance of people being held up, someone could be dead somewhere who knows what could happen between the time you got called and the time you arrived on scene.
[5:24:25] caughtereyes: @illegitemi is that a misdemeanor or a felony? Kappa
[5:25:15] PGMuNrOe: @Phantroneous They were not witnesses. They were partipants in an active hostage situation. They need to be identified.  Thats the R/S
[5:25:19] donsinkey: i see a bit of chat mixing up rs, and pc.
[5:25:27] PGMuNrOe: be it hostage or hostage taker
[5:25:32] splooshtasticals: the aritficial illusion of momentum through emotions is all they can really try. Shit is tiring when they get no results though
[5:25:35] Phantroneous: @PGMuNrOe no but the lawyer was a witness and called it in.
[5:25:39] Zilinity: not having that Guard gate there is such a good change
[5:25:42] illegitemi: either  \ or. you can be detained to further investigation
[5:26:04] Phantroneous: @PGMuNrOe they need to be identified anyways.

[5:26:22] deanb___: victim doesnt equal wetness
[5:26:46] Phantroneous: I think people aren't understanding what I was saying.
[5:26:58] donsinkey: @illegitemi once they have enough information it changes from rs to pc... so with the information your talking about it's more pc then rs.
[5:27:01] Null_Value: Its Brenda of course
[5:27:02] splooshtasticals: I thinks fine so workers can make cash anything lower is too slow imo

[5:28:06] splooshtasticals: The grind is already dreadfull as it is Sludge
[5:28:14] illegitemi: @donsinkey normally they wouldnt arresst till they are certain but it does happen especially if people dont cooperate or escalate it by resisiting etc
[5:28:38] Vikairius: Has to be a flop issue
[5:28:53] deanb___: you need the annoying crims tho, they hurt your brain but overall they add to rp
[5:29:28] splooshtasticals: Notice how it came after all the PD sucess
[5:29:54] caughtereyes: All I'm saying is irl the victims were further victimized by the cops and would definitely have a case for rights violation
[5:29:57] Vikairius: OOC, with Jesse Adler being involved and Siobhan being conflicted makes it interesting. Imma have to watch some vods
[5:30:53] deanb___: flop a real one

[5:31:49] sktbrdngdwgs: Flop is amazing.
[5:32:13] Vikairius: Is there actually no identification laws but SOP has identification case laws to follow?
[5:32:15] splooshtasticals: @caughtereyes I was thinking the same thing. As esfand said this is Reno911
[5:32:27] Zilinity: I‚Äôll test you. just to be an ass
[5:32:29] Vikairius: That is pretty frustrating as an Officer
[5:33:02] deanb___: @splooshtasticals +1

[5:40:40] BakinPacman: i feel like if they say that then come towards you later on you could feel threatened if they approach you without consent

If the person lawfully detained refuses to provide their name or identification during the investigation and there is insufficient evidence to establish probable cause that the person has committed a crime, then the person must be released.

[6:03:17] PGMuNrOe: @HavocusRex All people involved in a hostage situation are considered participants untill such time as they are identified and cleared. Failure for them to identify in itself gives more R/S on their potential involvement of commiting a crime.

[7:14:04] Bakemaan: dont*
[7:14:17] KryptSweetie: cost is 12 per now
[7:14:21] xtylaw: not really the mat ppl really fucked the market up with the price and then ppl mad it cost more to repair
[7:14:31] lordgarty: What about Cindy's place
[7:14:36] AfroAltruism: its very much a team effort now  when it comes to cars for PD
[7:14:37] 1_ncognit0: yea cause everyone wants circuit boards
[7:14:46] WIHEEILS25: with everyone going for gpu's sanitation is messing the market up
[7:14:49] lordgarty: Vinnys lol
[7:14:50] Vikairius: PD needs to higher a mechanic honestly
[7:15:08] Bakemaan: thats odd because someone got mats for 5 per last night
[7:15:30] Bakemaan: maybe it was a hookup
[7:15:39] lordgarty: Lang buddah pushing the price up lol
[7:15:44] Azzarill: there 7 per now
[7:16:02] Vikairius: A PD mechanic might be able to get state parts. Just a thought. Not sure what proper balance would be.
[7:16:04] Saxon217: Buddah really running a monopoly on the mats game now lol
[7:16:09] Bakemaan: so basically no one knows what the price is and the market is saturated

[7:16:27] KryptSweetie: Yeah most likely a hook up I know Patar was helping out when he can but not many are selling at 5-7 any more when it comes to sani workers
[7:16:45] carparker76: its wild that buying gpu's makes car repairs unaffordable.
[7:16:47] AfroAltruism: @Saxon217 its not an monopoly if anyone can work the job, it is price fixing tho

[7:36:52] deanb___: cornwood had possession of pd equipment and let i t slide
[7:37:14] lordgarty: I think he's had enough and wants to get caught so is taking more risks
[7:37:16] Bakemaan: according to google a lawyer can only lose his bar licence if the state revokes it, so I assume a judge would have too.
[7:37:17] TheGrayK: Ramee is so funny hell tempt fate say he doesn't care if he loses it and then when it gets close he freaks out about losing it

[8:01:32] Inox75: Did a judge authorised the creation of the list?
[8:01:38] dankNbeans: @swankytiger942221 you could literally just ask the streamer.  but ok.
[8:01:52] RetroGravy: Oh! It's Buck
[8:02:15] Sparbro2: not a illegal to investigate
[8:02:26] swankytiger942221: @danknbeans but that doesnt mean it's legal or right for them to think that. Some of these cops don't always do things by the book
[8:02:48] lordgarty: Shit just googled it it is a gas station what sort off degen life you living eating from gas stations dudes
[8:02:51] 2dollarmouse: when they trace a pattern of activity at a property, regardless of the owner - they can submit a warrant for that property
[8:02:56] deanb___: @dankNbeans @swankytiger942221 neither of you are wrong it doesn't 'prove' anything but its still worth while evidence to gather.
[8:03:12] 2dollarmouse: if you're dealing drugs out of a house and you get caught, and theyve been staking you out at multiple properties, they usually search ALL the properties
[8:03:22] dankNbeans: i don't argue with nonsubs, lol

[8:03:53] lordgarty: Going for the ball shot lol
[8:03:57] swankytiger942221: @danknbeans it's legal for them to do this BUT what I'm saying is you can't ASSUME because there is a criminal in the house that if a other car is parked there and the person is legal/a civil that doesmt mean they live there or are doing something wrong. That's all I'm saying bro
[8:04:22] lordgarty: It's intelligence gathering bro
[8:04:37] 2dollarmouse: yeah, theyd have to have probable cause to get a judge to sign off on a warrant
[8:04:48] swankytiger942221: @deanb___ Exactly. That's all I'm saying. That it doesmt prove anything really. It's just info. But MIGHT not be always right info
[8:04:49] Inox75: I think that the list is gonna get a lot a DAP distributed
[8:05:50] swankytiger942221: @inox75 most likely
[8:05:59] deanb___: @swankytiger942221 it's one of those misunderstandings that wouldn't happen if you were talking instead of typing to each other

[8:49:26] viewlessd: did u chase a blista yet? PepeLaugh
[8:49:27] Vikairius: I think when tires and other modifications other than turbos come into play it will change things better than just having car variety
[8:49:31] Luthercorpz: You'd figure your shit cop cars would at least be heavier but nope it's paper vs super cars LUL
[8:49:33] NotEverSober: I saw a criminal dinky little car get smashed into, drive head-on into light poles like 6 times last night and the car just kept on running LUL
[8:49:38] sealingfann: or just have the Taurus pit all the cvpi‚Äôs and take primary every time
[8:49:39] JDwight: is there a cap to how many cops can be on?
[8:49:39] theLastMooninite: Having 9F 220mph highway blasters 2.5 months into the server seems like poor balance
[8:49:55] lordgarty: The Taurus will become the cvpi in the near future
[8:49:59] rhydiaan: If they dont drip feed the same cars / class to both sides at the same time then it becomes heavily unfair for one side
[8:50:02] viewlessd: literally are cirmes are done it 150 mph cars KEKW
[8:50:06] deanb___: @NotEverSober civ/ crim cars are def more durable
[8:50:23] lordgarty: Yeah he's over aggressive
[8:50:31] theLastMooninite: Yeah Moonmoon's murder pits last night showed how strong the taurus is even though it has less weight than a CVPI
[8:50:41] Vikairius: Taurus driver been learning from McNulty and Lenny
[8:50:58] deanb___: @theLastMooninite HAHA TRUE he's getting dap'd for that shit though

[8:51:35] theLastMooninite: @deanb___ 100%, I'm a cop watcher and like seeing them get W's and be aggressive, but sending that lady into the ocean was probably too far lmao
[8:51:44] lordgarty: Cvpi like a steam train gathering speed
[8:51:46] dankNbeans: haven't seen that one in a while lol

[8:52:22] deanb___: @theLastMooninite im in the same boat but it was the, "maybe" 96 mph pit thats probably getting him the dap if not both
[8:52:36] Mr_Jaffs: Imaging the cars if Cornwood didnt put turbos in them...

[8:54:54] gateloz: o7 MEGALUL KILL THEM ALL
[8:54:56] WanderingElephant: and that voice was annoying
[8:54:57] SailorWS: They need to nerf the Knife and Wrench
[8:54:58] JFloUnknown: FortBush Bush strats
[8:54:59] NotEverSober: So, you cannot tase a guy after theyve wrecklessly evaded then crashed and ran out of their car and are holding weapons?
[8:55:03] n1_majorlavon_: nobody suspects
[8:55:05] llNoTToXiCll: i guess you got bushed?
[8:55:08] NotEverSober: Still have to go for tackle? LUL
[8:55:12] gateloz: @SailorWS balistic vest should block at least 1 knife
[8:55:12] Luthercorpz: Dayum they just straight killing cops
[8:55:15] Famiglia__: well no shit
[8:55:21] MetalicJive: jumps out of the bush and just yelled "die bitch die"
[8:55:24] LordNajeeb: Look like his down KEKW

[8:55:32] nuke_fla120: One shot knife and wrench dumbest thing on server LUL

[8:55:40] deanb___: good chase before hand
[8:55:43] purplepoodle89: to be fair, they telegraphed their plan when they pulled out wrenches in the tunnel; we got distracted with coms
[8:55:58] Mr_Jaffs: Why did they add a 30 sec delay?
[8:56:11] gateloz: @purplepoodle89 thats how people downed Lenny the other day by hiding around a corner with a knife

[8:56:14] Askicky: @Timmac lmao they couldnt shake you though that was some good ass driving, all those random jumps
[8:56:14] SailorWS: lock on, one shot knives/wrenches are crazy
[8:56:31] ThePatKing: I am dead bro
[8:56:38] TheKing0fCasual: @purplepoodle89 The hiding in the bush while distracting him while watching the others run in different directions was pretty smart but a poopy way to end the chase
[8:56:51] chronicfuels: @Mr_Jaffs my guess is for comms when ppl go down, limit the info ppl give once they go down in general. totally wild guess tho
[8:56:55] sunchipsz: @TheKing0fCasual how else are they supposed to get away really
[8:56:55] stoneysoul: @SailorWS oh so you can take multiple wrench shots to the head ? crazy
[8:56:57] Luthercorpz: Esfand been saying fk knives for awhile now
[8:56:57] gateloz: I feel like balistic vest should at least stop the knife 1 shot
[8:57:02] GreenMonk: that was a sick train dodge as well
[8:57:10] FilzG: takes a mag to kill them but one stab and youre dead
[8:57:14] Diaz10gtg: what happened with those that were on the red car?
[8:57:24] plaqboijuice: ..
[8:57:25] chronicfuels: @FilzG seriously lol
[8:57:26] budget5g: that was sick
[8:57:26] Askicky: that jump to the Bridge at cypress was sick damn lol
[8:57:27] deanb___: @TheKing0fCasual the 7 swaps the usually do LUL

[8:57:30] gateloz: Timmac cop Pog
[8:57:30] beastm0de423: that  was sick
[8:57:31] minhmd12: If wrench or knife dont oneshot, it should apply stun though
[8:57:32] SailorWS: stoneysoul you can get shot 10 times and not go down but a wrench one shots?
[8:57:36] Hey_its_Mady: Lets be honest, the funniest thing of this chase was "Looks like he's down" KEKW
[8:57:42] WIHEEILS25: yea that was a sick train dodge
[8:57:43] moneybroskis: hey sick chase brother. unlucky it had to end that way
[8:57:43] StreamElements: timmacHI
[8:57:47] dankNbeans: i thought you were gonna go for the HotWheels full loop, tbh lol
[8:57:50] Mr_Jaffs: chronicfuels i meant in 3.0 when they added a 30sec delay for 13a beeps
[8:57:52] moneybroskis: You hit that train dodge too damn
[8:57:53] jimmy216: It's good to see you back on cop <3
[8:57:54] Ch3zwiz: Fun chase <3
[8:57:54] pickle_peee: yeah it‚Äôs strange that the best stops bullets but doesn‚Äôt stop a knife 1 shot
[8:57:59] moneybroskis: <3
[8:58:01] jean_valjean: @timmac you actually popped off that chase well done!
[8:58:05] pickle_peee: *vest
[8:58:06] tuhinmalOW: GNOME ?
[8:58:09] stoneysoul: @SailorWS i agree that shots need more damage but complaining about knives/wrenches isnt it.
[8:58:11] dbnite: W CHASE
[8:58:12] WanderingElephant: the slow blade
[8:58:13] n1_majorlavon_: "it was mack" lirikSMUG
[8:58:17] IGotItFromMyMam4: @FilzG i saw one person got headshot and stood like nothing, from pd glock, ofc he bleed out eventually, but one shot from melee all the time Kappa
[8:58:18] MazOnline: any clips?

[8:58:29] budget5g: this guy PepeLaugh
[8:58:35] Tylerfosho: baldy PepeLaugh
[8:58:37] Askicky: the crim who was driving said "i hope they like dodging trains..." immediately gets sideswiped a train and Timmac comes out right behind em
[8:58:37] minhmd12: @stoneysoul imagine you miss 1 swing on cop, i think its done
[8:58:37] dbnite: MADE ALL THE JUMPS
[8:58:41] n1_majorlavon_: OMEGAKEKW
[8:58:42] Diaz10gtg: @SailorWS I think the problem is not the damage of the shots but the damage of the wrenches
[8:58:48] n1_majorlavon_: LMAO
[8:58:49] gateloz: they couldn't shake TIMMAC COP EZ
[8:58:58] Maxwell_07: best cop driver GIGAMACK

[8:59:05] SailorWS: Diaz10gtg i was saying that to someone who said the wrenches were fine
[8:59:12] stoneysoul: @minhmd12 swing on a cop and miss its ov you get lit up like its the 4th of july
[8:59:14] deanb___: wrench being more powerful than bullets is wild
[8:59:15] FilzG: vests should protect against stabs too
[8:59:26] ThePatKing: thats one cool thing about adding trains
[8:59:31] n1_majorlavon_: he nervous asf
[8:59:35] dbnite: GREAT CHASE
[8:59:38] stoneysoul: @Diaz10gtg bro let someone smack you in the head with a wrench and see if you still moving
[8:59:39] thatclubdj: That's a cadet ya?
[8:59:40] SailorWS: minhmd12 you shouldnt bring a wrench to a gun fight
[8:59:56] lordgarty: He didn't listen to the fucking directions
[8:59:59] gateloz: @Diaz10gtg if you can dodge a wrench you can dodge a dodgeball
[9:00:02] deanb___: @stoneysoul not wrong
[9:00:02] Askicky: @thatclubdj prolly
[9:00:03] SchudVhaze: great chase
[9:00:04] Diaz10gtg: @Diaz10gtg its rp not real life
[9:00:05] n1_majorlavon_: am i tripping or is she calling you mack?
[9:00:06] sunchipsz: bro 1 cop goes down and now everyones mad about melee weapons jeez
[9:00:11] WanderingElephant: shouldn't bring a gun to a wrench fight
[9:00:20] SchudVhaze: the terminator @Timmac EZ Clap
[9:00:22] dankNbeans: @stoneysoul ikr, lol, it's like five pounds of steel.
[9:00:26] gateloz: @sunchipsz i aint mad but it would be kinda cool if knife didn't 1 shot thru balistic vest.
[9:00:32] minhmd12: @SailorWS that even make sense, because that call a cheese move, it you fuck up your shot morelikely you go down
[9:00:35] ThePatKing: LUL
[9:00:37] DanLGG: He was about to turn around and let them go. what some timing
[9:00:40] dbnite: WIN/LOSE GREAT CHASE
[9:00:43] MetalicJive: @sunchipsz it's not the fact of it being a melee weapon or any weapon tbh it's that he hid in a bush to stab someone screaming die bitch die lmao
[9:00:57] stoneysoul: now if a cop has a gun drawn and they have a wrench they should have more fear for their life
[9:00:58] thatclubdj: Kekw

[9:01:47] us_ace: I've seen helmets make a difference when getting bonked in the head
[9:01:47] Vikairius: If an officer isn't vested it makes sense
[9:01:49] minhmd12: @stoneysoul so you said jeanpaul wrench cop in front of whole pd should be perma banned right LUL,
[9:01:54] dbnite: clips??
[9:01:54] ThePatKing: @Waltz_Disney they wanted new cop chars

[9:02:00] lookachef: should have shot
[9:02:04] Diaz10gtg: @sunchipsz u act like crims doesnt complain bout it lol
[9:02:10] DanLGG: That‚Äôs right. When Timmac is pursuing you gonna have to shank a cop cause that‚Äôs the only way you get out
[9:02:11] UpDownLeftRyght: timmac was great actual terminator
[9:02:12] swankytiger942221: What happened. I left for like 10min during the chase
[9:02:19] Waltz_Disney: @ThePatKing gotcha, I thought something happened lore wise lol
[9:02:20] Hey_its_Mady: The only thing bad was the other cops radio awareness LUL
[9:02:21] IGotItFromMyMam4: @stoneysoul that nvl or other rule, forgot its name, is slippery slope, kinda hate it
[9:02:24] gateloz: they need to add flashlight to the glock
[9:02:29] gateloz: you would've prob seen him
[9:02:30] Vikairius: He has no reason to shoot lethal and they were out of tazer range
[9:02:37] Vikairius: Plus he was outnumbered
[9:02:40] Askicky: @chat thats not really on Liam, he was the only one that was able to keep up with the car
[9:02:41] deanb___: flashlight and lazer to pd glock soon
[9:02:45] halos420: just preemptively shoot everyone, that way you never get hit with a wrench KEKW
[9:02:49] VirtualVoyager: it was a lot of fun to watch, but it toke a vey long timme for the pitting to start.
[9:02:49] deanb___: allegedly
[9:02:58] us_ace: should have rpg'd lol
[9:03:02] Excelsior_Espio: anyone have a clip of the bonking
[9:03:06] stoneysoul: i just want to be clear here. Liam did an AMAZING job. those crims were doing great until there was 3 of them and 1 cop and did that
[9:03:24] purplepoodle89: wrench bonk
[9:03:29] Manawa73: thought it was a wrench  but not sure
[9:03:46] stoneysoul: im pretty sure you go stabbed tho
[9:03:46] JFloUnknown: It should say the 'cause of injury' when incapacitated to help with the RP
[9:03:49] deanb___: think it was a wrench but it doesn't matter tbh
[9:03:50] lordgarty: He was in pursuit off two then one popped out from a Bush no chance to shoot anyway its a mute argument
[9:03:55] dbnite: it was dark, nonodys fault
[9:04:01] Vikairius: Honestly I'm not even mad about the bush. The "die bitch die" as he stabbed was cringe
[9:04:02] gateloz: @stoneysoul The cops were insane drivers man they did every trick.. And Timmac DODGED A TRAIN EZ
[9:04:10] stoneysoul: great scene, great chase. go work officer!
[9:04:12] dhanaz: i thought every melee is one tap from the back so doesnt matter which
[9:04:16] dbnite: TRAIN CLIP
[9:04:20] JFloUnknown: The train dodge was sick
[9:04:28] stoneysoul: good*
[9:04:30] GRaFFiC_: Im new here, But I like the way you handled that guy
[9:04:30] PanicSwitched: Tim is cracked as a driver, that was sick from both sides to watch
[9:04:33] Excelsior_Espio: @Vikairius  BatChesting
[9:04:41] lordgarty: Anybody clip the train dodge Tim play it back bro awesome dodge
[9:05:00] LetoaSKY: TBH, you did all you could perfectly Timmac. You were an insane driver in the chase, just a little disappointed that you were the only cop there with no backup.
[9:05:01] dankNbeans: mute argument saabKEK
[9:05:13] VirtualVoyager: Liamm MacMahon should apply to drive the taurus cop car
[9:05:33] Vikairius: Anyone know who was with Beric?

[9:19:34] lordgarty: Nice one sailor
[9:19:38] Vikairius: The cameras stacked. The lower durability got matched
[9:19:48] halos420: lockpicks do that too
[9:20:28] DanLGG: ohhh it stackdd on a broken one. yeah that sucks. I saw someone ruin a brand new lock pick by looking at someone‚Äôs low quality lock pick so it stacked and fked both lol

[9:22:48] NoT2BaDTV: are gruppe 6 allowed to shoot to defend the cash like real cash transit drivers do?
[9:22:57] deanb___: @NoT2BaDTV nope
[9:23:04] NoT2BaDTV: thats dumb
[9:23:05] halos420: @NoT2BaDTV they dont have guns yet, but they will be eventually
[9:23:08] Vikairius: I assume they will once fun licenses happen
[9:23:11] K00PAD00P: @NoT2BaDTV imagine killing someone for someone elses moneey LUL
[9:23:15] Vikairius: Gun*
[9:23:28] NoT2BaDTV: @Vikairius fun license means the same thing lol
[9:23:41] Vikairius: True
[9:23:53] deanb___: even with gun licenses it will prob be only if your life is threatened you can shoot
[9:23:59] DanLGG: They can defend their property from being stolen
[9:24:08] Vikairius: Honestly, if I had an armored vehicle like that, I'd have a 20 ton bullet to be honest
[9:24:08] dankNbeans: blocking the vault door is so simple it's kinda genius
[9:24:40] K00PAD00P: @dankNbeans almost as genius as pretending to be a trash bag and robbing sanitation

[9:26:13] dankNbeans: i mean, some G6 actually guard their trucks, and some speedrun it without a care in the world.  they gonna learn.
[9:26:17] lookachef: why couldn‚Äôt he have shot someone who ran from the police, held someone hostage, and put multiple people in danger.(including himself who ended up in the hospital)
[9:26:35] DanLGG: 2 seconds after Denzel is explaining it‚Äôs a tool to enable rp not to read so to speak lol
[9:26:41] SailorWS: lookachef RP reasons. Never fun to just start shooting
[9:27:00] deanb___: @lookachef just isn't how the rp works, have to be threating life to shoot
[9:27:08] lookachef: I disagree. I think it‚Äôs less fun to have criminals like that.
[9:27:24] DanLGG: It‚Äôs rp.
[9:27:32] SailorWS: lookachef look up magdump szn from 2 years ago. thats what would happen if cops started shooting ppl
[9:27:34] Vikairius: Crims will just escalate if they are getting shot at
[9:27:35] GamerGoat007: That would also mean that business accounts should be implemented
[9:27:37] evilmnkey4: laundered money LUL
[9:27:39] deanb___: @lookachef it can be from cop prospective, it's looks completly different form crim
[9:27:47] halos420: this dude knows alot without knowing alot lol

[9:28:13] lordgarty: Sailor your right I watched it all back then
[9:28:37] lookachef: I guess
[9:28:39] SailorWS: Granted magdump szn happened bc of a Mr K 9999 hold for some bs
[9:28:44] SailorWS: but its the same thing
[9:28:57] lookachef: thanks

[9:32:09] DanLGG: You have to look at it from both sides. If pd started shooting for less so will crims and getting shot down over a traffic stop sucks lol
[9:32:09] erquilene: the train is epic mechanic tho LUL
[9:33:14] erquilene: i cant believe you BOTH managed to DODGE that train by driving on wall
[9:33:20] erquilene: LUL
[9:33:22] JFloUnknown: NOOOO
[9:33:22] Zazun_: Trains like a natural disaster lol
[9:33:23] lookachef: they just stabbed a cop who was walking behind them.
[9:33:23] DanLGG: apparently the crim said I hope pd likes dodging trains then gets railed and sees you dodge it
[9:33:45] deanb___: economy is also super tough for crims rn, so many steps to clean the money and they can get caught evry step

[9:43:27] erquilene: what now tho.. why will move the guy? cuz all the pd have to do is just camp the spot
[9:43:44] erquilene: will they move*
[9:45:54] theLastMooninite: Seems like you gotta work your way down the chain and prove the bottom 'tier' of money is illegal, then you can justify that everything above it is illegal too
[9:45:56] DanLGG: pd won‚Äôt just camp the spot that‚Äôs no fun for anyone but That‚Äôs why they are talking in rp to try to piece it together with IC info
[9:46:01] deanb___: @erquilene it's kind of expected pd won't just camp the spot
[9:46:29] theLastMooninite: Moonmoon would camp the spot, he was staking out convenience stores last night lol
[9:47:14] deanb___: @theLastMooninite convince stores is differnt
[9:47:18] deanb___: imo
[9:48:05] theLastMooninite: Someone pulling up to the sewers in a 10-60 car is all you need

[9:51:28] deanb___: @theLastMooninite +1
[9:52:11] conorlad: does timmac still do gomer?
[9:52:20] simplyl33: Do locals drive clubs. If so blue is popular
[9:52:22] Vikairius: It's all felonies
[9:52:25] SailorWS: legislation would say?
[9:52:26] mainmandaryl: All felonies i believe
[9:52:42] deanb___: legislation does in fact say
[9:52:55] Rex2764: timmacDR timmacDR
[9:53:23] erquilene: not currently... that is a bit of stretch.. cuz they can fail run.. and taht moment it is illegal.. or when you have scuff run..
[9:53:34] BKBiggy: missapproproation of company funds
[9:54:00] Vikairius: It shouldn't be outside of a G6 vehicle tbh
[9:54:09] ghostman16: ^
[9:54:30] SailorWS: Possession of marked goods
[9:54:38] erquilene: @Vikairius people keep some spare when the run is scuffed.. otherwise noone would do it
[9:54:45] SailorWS: since grime trucks have goods that can be stolen
[9:54:54] ItsMagikzz: @erquilene they keep it in their vehicle though
[9:55:21] erquilene: @ItsMagikzz but ther eis limit how much that can carry no? were there not some runs that eat whole cargo?

[9:56:51] theLastMooninite: The fact that they're marked as G6 bills would justify it as stealing company property. You can't just take shit off the job because you work with it.
[9:56:58] slim_fadey68: Wsh
[9:57:14] DanLGG: That‚Äôs why they are having this convo and will take it to a city council meeting where they will try to sell it as illegal.
[9:57:21] fatboyfresh01: 100% gonna catch Richard doing this üòÇ
[9:57:37] Noomad: You don't really need a new law, you just need to have someone classify that cash as stolen. Since it's a state job would that be the mayor? timmacHMM
[9:57:53] Lordbidwell: making shit happen SeemsGood
[9:58:08] theLastMooninite: Oh yeah G6 money is supposed to be state funds. That'd be an extremely easy reason to justify why you shouldn't have it on you without supervision/on the job.
[9:58:58] livenotonevil_: monkaHmm
[9:59:44] mrfreetooplay: timmacTHUMB
[10:00:15] erquilene: @theLastMooninite by that logic they could book them for stealing/robbing a bank ... which was already set that should not be a thing ... wonder if this gonan be re-visited
