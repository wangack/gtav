[2:46:26] Luthercorpz: Like 15 mins after 2pm reset they were all sold out
[2:46:33] aston_ca: They have enough for 5 already I think
[2:46:37] treynrek: Which is scary. Everytime k has molotovs...you know what happens
[2:46:40] halos420: @treynrek I feel like it may be possible, but it's moonshine clearly so far.
[2:46:52] halos420: Yeah just don't give chawa a Molotov
