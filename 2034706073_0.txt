[8:30:29] divinitypm: wait so new gpu mines 1.2 per day and cost double?
[8:30:30] fhlol: it's worth it because you can just buy another rack
[8:30:31] slolucid: Not worth it
[8:30:31] MilkMeSenpai: @zettavion LOL
[8:30:32] zHira: @knowbodyrva actually 5Head
[8:30:32] dluo15: dont bother
[8:30:33] Volt0: can they put the 6060 inside the computer and not the rack
[8:30:34] Mehscope: 1.5k mats
[8:30:36] its_sisimarie: What about power?

[8:30:43] avaiano2: @Lysium maybe its worth to make a bunch
[8:30:46] iGoByMatt: its 1k for 4 EZ
[8:30:47] dragdance: @slolucid D company can work towards it and can set then up one by one
[8:30:50] shiverPK: too many mats
[8:30:51] Snackboy898: @Volt0 doesnt do anything
[8:30:52] imacableguy: maybe 6060 in pc and basics in rack?
[8:30:53] GoatNamedFeliciaa: 2 more racks full of cheap GPU for less than the cost of 1 gpu bLue print will get you more coin sooner
[8:30:55] bloodx_x: @Volt0 pc mines 1 a day no matter the gpu
[8:30:55] zzayf: 250 now
[8:30:55] avaiano2: its 250
[8:30:57] QuimS2: IT DID 250
[8:31:00] 234yh: 1250 boards for 1 butt per day
[8:31:02] Snackboy898: 1..5k
[8:31:04] inkaaa__: ye x got mad cause he spent like 200k on mats
[8:31:04] QuimS2: CHECK THE NEW PCS AS WELL FOR 3
[8:31:05] mktheassassin: yes
[8:31:06] iGoByMatt: 1500
[8:31:06] MaeyHam: how many racks can you make with 1 blue print?
[8:31:07] CeeJayySeven: damn they haven’t sold a pc in awhile
[8:31:09] imacableguy: it’s 250 per basic gpu.
[8:31:09] icoyskee: 1500
[8:31:09] QuimS2: IT IS#
[8:31:09] tidyee: Nooo
[8:31:10] 3lonpich: if you sell pcs and buy racks with old gpus, you are going to have more BTC
[8:31:10] avaiano2: @Lysium and thats 0.2 butcoin daily
[8:31:11] Niguyen_: blue print cost alot
[8:31:12] Mehscope: i think its more worth just saving for the better ones
[8:31:12] redsprite0000: That's worth it
[8:31:13] Ch3zwiz: yessir
[8:31:13] 00Nikh: @Lysium check drone it did say the blueprints were "limited" maybe it cycles new blueprints
[8:31:14] Killsbury_: 1.5 is great. use em till you sell em
[8:31:14] avaiano2: @Lysium its worth
[8:31:14] slolucid: @dragdance why not use that capital in getting the new GPUs
[8:31:16] lPacoTacol: its not
[8:31:16] harukakono: 15k
[8:31:19] GunsmokeTV: no
[8:31:19] Niguyen_: do it
[8:31:19] welvienu: worth
[8:31:20] anaadhi0: +1
[8:31:20] QuimS2: IT IS BOO
[8:31:21] imacableguy: did you borrow GPUs just for test?
[8:31:23] themonstaking: Then sell it when you replace it
[8:31:23] buyitnow89: Buy 2 bp
[8:31:24] tidyee: It's not
[8:31:25] fhlol: 100% worth
[8:31:25] welvienu: or sell it

[8:31:28] omgshroomie: worth it
[8:31:28] harukakono: 1.5k
[8:31:29] uqiv: x said it’s not
[8:31:31] iTzJboot: do it
[8:31:32] alldayerryday: lysYes
[8:31:33] harukakono: omE
[8:31:34] zettavion: 2?
[8:31:35] N0ttTurtle: worth it EZ
[8:31:35] knowbodyrva: yeah using GPUs from the extra PCs seems like it makes more sense
[8:31:35] Mehscope: how much do you get from the better gpu’s
[8:31:35] avaiano2: yeah
[8:31:37] buyitnow89: Do it
[8:31:39] N0ttTurtle: worth it EZ 󠀀
[8:31:39] GunsmokeTV: only big  gpu
[8:31:39] Fossabot: 🔥 The daily subgoal is at 200 subs.
[8:31:41] Ch3zwiz: the drone bps might expire as well
[8:31:41] 3lonpich: you then sell the racks full of GPU
[8:31:41] kevin_bop: OHHH
[8:31:42] avaiano2: @Lysium farm now and sell
[8:31:44] Killsbury_: @uqiv x is 100% wrong
[8:31:44] alaouskie: where can i find a recap
[8:31:45] ProxyRn_: mhm do it
[8:31:45] fhlol: you don't even need to sell the old gpus you can put them in a new rac
[8:31:45] iTzJboot: your cooking
[8:31:46] Yimmak: 3 days for smoke crack
[8:31:47] tidyee: Noooo
[8:31:47] RekterZA: xdd used mining gpus
[8:31:47] QuimS2: WORTH U CAN SELL THEM
[8:31:48] avaiano2: @Lysium actual 500iq
[8:31:49] anaadhi0: it works out yep
[8:31:50] 234yh: nahh am too cooked
[8:31:52] N0ttTurtle: worth it EZ
[8:31:54] tidyee: Nooooooo
[8:31:56] ziizazz: sell used GPU EZ
[8:31:56] Adberssson: Probably is your electricity house LUL
[8:31:56] ItsGibbzy: Wiat racks?
[8:31:58] welvienu: worth, pc or sell it
[8:31:58] QuimS2: OR PUT IN THE OTHER RACK ALWAYS WORTH
[8:31:59] Extra_Reckless: jp wants to stack mats?
[8:31:59] ItsGibbzy: GPU Racks?
[8:32:00] izar111: YES
[8:32:02] SimpOnMyShrimp: YEP
[8:32:03] cj122455: make them use them until u sell them @lysium
[8:32:06] uqiv: @killsbury_ i don’t think so LUL
[8:32:06] iTzJboot: figure out if its cheaper
[8:32:07] imacableguy: could build second rack and test 1 gpu in each?
[8:32:09] DangersClose: bro just sell the old gpu's in the rig and fill it with the new ones, so simple. Leave the 10 computers as they are
[8:32:09] blazerox: gpu blueprint is only 2 uses
[8:32:10] zzayf: its worth because you speed up the ability to buy blueprints for the bigger gpus
[8:32:11] Juice1g: your house is nice
[8:32:11] Optie: u need 4 more bp so 20 butts for full rack
[8:32:12] veggiebaka6: sell and if there is a percentage off sell as refurbished
[8:32:12] 234yh: i got math degree what you need
[8:32:14] alldayerryday: racks will sell for sure EZ money
[8:32:14] twitchisbaaad: Big gpu cost 5 butt 4 print
[8:32:14] Volt0: i mean if you plan on selling gpus any time the rack not being full is a waste
[8:32:16] mirasghost: if u wanna be efficient in terms of butcoin, buy regular gpus rn and fill up racks
[8:32:17] Shadowdott: power bill gonna be cooked soon
[8:32:17] avaiano2: putting 30k on those cpus is worth
[8:32:18] izar111: 2 rocks, 1 6060 1 old gpus
[8:32:20] buyitnow89: Gpu rack is op cuz mass produce basic gpu cuh
[8:32:22] redsprite0000: It's worth but yall gotta start selling your parts cheaper to get more liquid
[8:32:24] Sandeeptha: how much better is the new gpu?
[8:32:24] mirasghost: till u can build more new gpus
[8:32:25] fhlol: old gpus with racks is better, you're time gated by stacking new gpus
[8:32:25] rybohh: u can use then in the next rack too @lysium
[8:32:27] zettavion: Kinda miss the kitchen though
[8:32:27] welvienu: worth early
[8:32:28] Ch3zwiz: you don't have enough butcoin to fill w/ new gpus, so it's worth it till you reach that point @Lysium
[8:32:29] anaadhi0: you can sell gpus anyway
[8:32:29] RekterZA: x is 100% buying more boards anyways so worth it
[8:32:29] mlgasfuq: Super worth
[8:32:29] redsprite0000: Prices gonna tank
[8:32:31] RizenMuun: give it away for free
[8:32:31] divinitypm: how much does new gpu mine per day
[8:32:36] austinj30: Craft basic GPU and put in rack whilst trying to sell them
[8:32:36] RizenMuun: :0 :0
[8:32:38] 3lonpich: if you dont do that, others will catch up
[8:32:38] toofarbrothatwastoofar: can anyone explain why they been wasting 1 butc for scan everyday? cant u reuse the old Ips and mac?
[8:32:38] kevin_bop: @RizenMuun cooked
[8:32:39] CeeJayySeven: yall should sell the racks for 30-50k and get a nice car
[8:32:39] GGings1: how much are 6060s again?
[8:32:41] lPacoTacol: can the other pcs get smoke now? @Lysium
[8:32:41] i1_Ghost: 1500 boards plus need BPs
[8:32:41] iniblu: install em if you got em
[8:32:43] roodalele: its worth the only issue is selling the low gpus later on
[8:32:43] iTzJboot: company would be hyped on this
[8:32:44] dluo15: u need to sell ur gpus first at the high price before they drop
[8:32:44] koiiza: y’all need to hire an accountant for the company
[8:32:45] QuimS2: ITS WORTH CUZ U WILL ALWAYS NEED EXTRA GPUS FOR NEW RACKS
[8:32:45] GoatNamedFeliciaa: 2 more racks full of cheap gpu will get you 4 extra coin a day, that cost 4 coin. 2 big gpus for 5 coin only gets you .8 more coin a day
[8:32:47] Phoenix_Nectar: share the gpu you have with two racks
[8:32:49] Killsbury_: @uqiv They will get an extra 1.8-2 butc per day for 1.5k, that's easily worth it
[8:32:54] zzayf: yes
[8:32:54] TheGlobGoblin: yes
[8:32:55] avaiano2: prob
[8:32:55] themonstaking: no
[8:32:57] welvienu: put it or sell it
[8:32:57] SandHanitizer1: just transfer the gpu from newer computer to the rack
[8:32:57] mlgasfuq: u need 25 butcoin for 10 advanced gpu which is so not worth
[8:33:00] Granny_Juices: YEP
[8:33:03] anaadhi0: WORTH IT
[8:33:03] QuimS2: U RIGHT ITS GOOD
[8:33:03] On3LonelyPanda: worht it
[8:33:05] IzMuffinn: Yea
[8:33:08] knowbodyrva: having the GPUS farm btc on PCs that don’t have smokecrack is a waste rn, put them hoes in the big rack
[8:33:09] iGoByMatt: 2 more racks full of cheap gpu will get you 4 extra coin a day, that cost 4 coin. 2 big gpus for 5 coin only gets you .8 more coin a day
[8:33:09] Deity_oHw: raycNodders
[8:33:10] mirasghost: question is
[8:33:10] DangersClose: do not make any more desks
[8:33:10] YNGthay: an intern accountant would be hardddd
[8:33:13] mirasghost: how much cash do u guys have
[8:33:13] its_sisimarie: lysYes
[8:33:15] Ch3zwiz: worth it
[8:33:15] dragdance: @slolucid cause 10 gpu is only 2 BTC and it takes heavy amount of BTC to get them in the first place. You can get the same amount of BTC by adding more pc setup but will it take initial 4 days to get the app and transfer to main
[8:33:16] Shadowdott: buy some coin?
[8:33:17] tieten1234: do it
[8:33:18] crackersssssss: why are you locked for the next three days @Lysium

[8:33:23] izar111: More gpus will make it faster
[8:33:23] QuimS2: GET MORE ITS WORTH
[8:33:25] themonstaking: Those 3 new computers almost have 3 Butcoin
[8:33:27] KirinRamen: powerbills gonna cost like 20k PepeLaugh
[8:33:27] Lnerd_ratio_Lfelloff: make some moneeeeeeey EZ
[8:33:28] andyhlp: do math now
[8:33:28] Extra_Reckless: tomorrow more blueprints an more bigger ones
[8:33:31] 11_cliff: compute it rn bruh\
[8:33:34] fhlol: It's $8800 for 1.2 butt coin per day if you fill the rack
[8:33:34] zzayf: you could be making 2.4 butcoin on that one pc if you fill it with normal gpus
[8:33:35] welvienu: call intern KEKW
[8:33:38] avaiano2: @Lysium yeah so let each gpu farm 0.2 daily
[8:33:40] Phoenix_Nectar: or take one pc to your room in the apartment and add a rack
[8:33:40] andyhlp: wallet the newer pcs and buy smokecrack
[8:33:41] cisco_lav: 80k bill incoming
[8:33:42] IzMuffinn: How much is the power bill
[8:33:43] Soreyouken: calculate it asap
[8:33:43] anon1224v2: How much butc do the 3 new pc have?
[8:33:43] P369_: power bill will be fine if you take all the lights down ngl, computers only take 10
[8:33:44] avaiano2: oh that could be a problem
[8:33:44] omgshroomie: put gpu in rack
[8:33:44] mirasghost: ye legit the only issue is how much cash u guys have
[8:33:47] 2muchdarkness: @Lysium bro why even worry about power bill now?????? just deal wit that later
[8:33:48] fhlol: you just removed lights
[8:33:48] Killsbury_: @Lysium an extra 1.8-2 butc per day for $1.5k, that's easily worth it
[8:33:48] iTzJboot: youll be up
[8:33:50] blazerox: Or if the blueprints are no longer available
[8:33:50] ladyash101: get a loan to cover first bill EZ
[8:33:51] dragdance: Only 10 per pc
[8:33:54] alman22: bro your bill is going to be like 100k
[8:33:54] iTzJboot: company has more money
[8:33:56] Shadowdott: remove all the lights
[8:33:57] mlgasfuq: FUCK THE LIGHTS
[8:33:59] bumawze: The rack only takes 1 power no matter how many GPU in it
[8:33:59] divinitypm: all good then but coin price goes up

[8:34:03] Hypaholic: Buy more than one house and mine from both?
[8:34:03] monkeyman071023: power def gonna be 50k
[8:34:04] rybohh: the gpus don’t affect the power of the rack
[8:34:05] YNGthay: u need maximillian to drop the price of shit
[8:34:05] shiverPK: remove kitchen and lights
[8:34:06] CeeJayySeven: @lysium But coin is perma farmed. You gotta turn it into money buy using the coin to buy racks to sell for like 30-50k
[8:34:06] GoatNamedFeliciaa: Buying racks and filling them with small gpu gets you more btc faster for a lower btc cost
[8:34:06] P369_: computers are only 10 each all the lights are fucking yall
[8:34:06] Aldonaitorr: DID YOU GUYS SOLD THE TRAILER ?
