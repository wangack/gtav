[8:16:50] Phasehero: Just egos thats all Like Jason said " Everyone has massive egos in the city and wants to be main character
[8:16:50] IraqiWizard: I just love that Eugene has jack saved on his phone as "Jack the cunt"
[8:16:53] willowompoo: @bbuhbowler i should work on my tone LUL
[8:16:56] cristina217: @mr_tvi they don‚Äôt know what happened tho, serious rpers don‚Äôt even watch clips

[8:17:18] Amuze586: Sometimes you just gotta roll with it. Can't listen to 2000 opinions.
[8:17:20] AgadhiTheGreat: The sad part about this is that the girl ooc'd which means this story line should not exist but idk how you would hand this now that its progressed multiple storylines, I guess just keep going with it...

[8:17:40] jonty1998: did she mean glazing jason or nmp
[8:17:41] AddyAdam: thats why its kinda weird hes brining it all back up instead of just letting it go lol
[8:17:43] kalovec: report it then if it was that shitty, OOC mald in game is bannable
[8:17:46] narcosenjoyer: Ocean dumping isn't RP either.
[8:17:46] willowompoo: EZ cream her
[8:17:48] yessirski1710: Isn‚Äôt Jason going to call the cops
[8:17:50] kayfabedave: @IraqiWizard LUL

[8:18:00] Liink93: @madeuplol clip ?
[8:18:00] Fabio10296: PepeLaugh
[8:18:02] RodKage: no pun intended LUL
[8:18:05] dangwifi: the solution is obvious: rob the lumber union >:)
[8:18:07] BBUHbowler: @Acie what else does Vee think   happened other than them trying to set y'all up?
[8:18:07] ribs010: @kalovec I thnk Grandpa mightve
[8:18:11] qihk: @madeuplol when did that happen?
[8:18:15] theace8869: So if you OOC the storyline has to get dropped?
[8:18:19] DreamsPeek: @addyadam in the conversation he said he was representing the things he saw of his group that he doesn't want to get to Aubrey
[8:18:22] alexraxer1: acieGUN the puppy
[8:18:23] madeuplol: Sanni truck 8 hour mark
[8:18:26] Specter_Senpai: Just have jason go get wood om
[8:18:27] jaswho2: @theace8869 nah
[8:18:29] Divine_Saint: U need trunk space for chop
[8:18:30] MoogieCowser: peppo doesn't watch clips or other streams, he wouldnt know if anything weird happened
[8:18:30] iiidaaah: @theace8869 no
[8:18:30] boyboy242899: You going kill the dog? lol
[8:18:33] 42arc: @willowompoo that would be funny af, raia creaming her
[8:18:42] BupeHappy: tbh it's a reach that glazer is an attack at nora ooc
[8:18:43] kalovec: @ribs010 well good luck with that
[8:18:44] Phasehero: @DreamsPeek Yup, but Civ gang needs to own up for the robbing
[8:18:48] quadriplegic30: you miss so much rp b/c you talk to chat too much
[8:18:48] Crewcabanger24: you did rob them though right?
[8:18:51] willowompoo: YEP
[8:18:52] StreamElements: YEP COCK
[8:18:54] ribs010: @42arc OMEGALUL
[8:18:59] nicky_nr: the lady nvl'd and went ooc what would you expect nunu to do
[8:19:01] everyone1980: yeah I agree
[8:19:02] jaswho2: @Crewcabanger24 nope om
[8:19:03] catquickspider: @madeuplol its different cause nunu was joking...the wood girl was malding
[8:19:04] ArtemisRost: I wonder how they even know KEKW It makes no sense
[8:19:09] evkay: Yeh both sides escalated things in a way that made sense
[8:19:10] theace8869: For anyone that wants context. NORA has a clip of the ocean dumping on her Youtube channel
[8:19:11] Shikafrecko: relaaxxx chat please
[8:19:12] willowompoo: yall started the rp but the girl went south so that made it awkward
[8:19:16] MarkMakesArt: does anyone have a vod link or timestamp for the event we're all talkin about
[8:19:16] printerman22: @bupehappy she didnt even know nunu in game
[8:19:18] BonsaiZendog: Ocean dumping kills RP. It forces someone to not recall the event and ends stories, it is not RP. It should only be used in extreme occasions, not to just get away from petty crime.
[8:19:26] hangryzai: @crewcabanger24 they failed the robbery
[8:19:29] InfiniteLimitX: Its great RP better to have these kind of talks
[8:19:30] DreamsPeek: They could and it would be kind but
[8:19:31] 42arc: @Crewcabanger24 yes but they didn't have proof they did, just a said name, could have been any1
[8:19:32] girlballor: i do not think either vee or jason were involved with any of it
[8:19:32] ArtemisRost: I remember Vader even took down her ID in case it was to escalate.
[8:19:34] alexraxer1: is a dog eat dog world , you rob or get robbed in los santos acieGUN

[8:59:17] crookz_n_castlez: Stolen
[8:59:21] DreamsPeek: That to say no you don't personally have to do the grinding you just have to get connected and there has to have been someone somewhere who did that effort at some point before the time you get the unlock
