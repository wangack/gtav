[2:08:40] TheShaunBro: Visa Racing bulls livery is cool @uhSnow
[2:08:40] daLight: @Amandathecookie If it was up to F1 teams, they'd probably still all have cigarette ads
[2:08:40] StreamElements: Ads support this stream massively, sorry if ads popped up at the wrong moment. But you could always subscribe or get Twitch Turbo to avoid getting ads!
[2:08:59] Morri89: yeah thats why it's called kick
[2:09:11] Bakemaan: stake is crypto gambling so yeah probably banned in some countries
[2:09:16] Morri89: the team name
[2:09:16] Reudl_: My link didnt send but did you see the whatsapp logo on the merc wheel? for the ptt
[2:09:19] gimpling_: Livery will just change depending on the location
[2:09:24] Chinu959: yeah it will be called Kick F1 team instead of stake in countries where gambling is banned
[2:09:35] MrPhoNoodle: i thought the f1 team was called Stake but had to rename to Kick
[2:09:44] Cephyric: I'd honestly have thought that cigarrette companies are a generally slow death business with the amount of push against them
[2:09:50] Bakemaan: if Stake gambled in USD if would be fine
[2:09:51] Morri89: kick sauber because they couldn't use stake because of gamba
[2:09:54] Bakemaan: it*
[2:09:59] EmrysorMerlin: Probably don't think it worth the cost
[2:10:11] Cephyric: Especially in the UK with that whole "if you are under 16 now you will never be able to legally buy cigarettes" thing
[2:10:13] ArchDevi1: That would be a good battle if Twitch did sponsor a team

[3:02:55] Thebloc: cuz the romans couldnt count
[3:02:56] IdleElectric: correction of the time the orbit actually takes
[3:02:57] Hellnolf: Because the rotation around the sun isnt exactly 365 days i
[3:02:58] daLight: because technically every year should be a quarter day longer
[3:02:58] CeruleanBandit: An actual year is 365.25ish days
[3:02:59] SteelMintMedic: cuz a day isnt 24hrs
[3:02:59] Enceladus251: Cause one solar year is around 365,25 days

[3:03:29] BluGiant: Nerdge
[3:03:30] Huudini: Cause of Earth's Orbit and the actual amount of time for us to go around. We have to have the extra day to keep the calendar year on point
[3:03:31] CeruleanBandit: We also add a second here and there
[3:03:48] T3hTarget36: because there is 365.25 days in a year
[3:03:51] IdleElectric: One day every 4 years, unless it's a century in which case it isn't, UNLESS it's a millennium, in which case it is
[3:04:10] EmrysorMerlin: @idleelectric close it has to divide by 400

[3:51:51] TenseTokki: The USA probably has rods from God at this point
[3:51:58] StarWhistle517: space nukes be extra secret
[3:52:00] Breo_McGuinness: If there was oil on the Moon, we would already have a base there
[3:52:03] structief: Launching nuclear weapons in space is tricky, because at some point, you have to get it off the ground..without exploding anywhere close, right?
