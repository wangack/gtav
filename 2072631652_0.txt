[4:03:13] gon_freecssx: u can’t predict shit like that
[4:03:13] xxunicornxx99: Hmm
[4:03:13] upyours19: usually gang life is like u have to follow them if ur a hangaround theres like hierarchy stuff
[4:03:17] SnippetyHat: I'm not trying to argue I'm just saying
[4:03:21] gem02_: yeah i dont think gangs are for u, a heist crew would fit u
[4:03:22] Callisto3: Gang life is not for Elo I think
[4:03:23] ojubu: they aren’t here for the jokes when they’re doing serious business
[4:03:24] NightmareOptics: I like that about eli though. He isn't serious and I feel like his chaos can be utilized if the members know how to utilize it
[4:03:26] alcharvard: maybe not now, but at least test the waters
[4:03:27] DollKnivez: to be fair they’re being a bit unreasonable, it’s no one’s fault
[4:03:33] ditaleeno: dundees not very serious either, this gang though
[4:03:36] producedbyblu: they joke around but there is times where you have to be somewhat serious
[4:03:38] BluePhanttom: But every serious group needs that one person LUL
[4:03:45] spiritking1987: this the serious rp section not the joke rp type ellum people take this serious when it comes to this type ellum swimmin

[4:03:52] shivang1497: call carmella
[4:04:03] P_Herbo24: it’s for sure kinda not Eli’s vibes
[4:04:04] gem02_: yep
[4:04:05] alcharvard: u can be a perma hang around instead of a gangmember
[4:04:11] upyours19: gang life is supposed to be like hierarchy and have to listen to superiors and stuff yeah
[4:04:11] producedbyblu: civ gang might be for you, none of them are serious
[4:04:14] TaySands: chatterboxWaving chatterboxWaving chatterboxWaving chatterboxWaving
[4:04:16] hngryghozt: blaming you for getting robbed is crazy lol

[4:05:11] Chaotic13: yeah the vibes arent for u
[4:05:12] rayen_04: there won't be any hang around for eli if he joins
[4:05:34] upyours19: so u dont have to commit to one group
[4:06:02] gian_peachy: How about raia's team?
[4:06:08] upyours19: yeah u dont have to commit to just one
[4:06:16] gem02_: civ gang YEP
[4:06:17] DollKnivez: honestly them being very serious is a good test for Eli
[4:06:18] BabylonHunter: imma be honest with you man. Not many people can work with a character like Eli. the unpredictability is hard to match with

[4:15:10] dee_love16: wait what thing before? I missed a lot of what happened
[4:15:17] sunnythedrunk: Eli fits in with Civ gang I agree
[4:15:19] mrloso47: I understand
[4:15:25] clintonio_oxide: it's more meme-y which is good
[4:15:31] shivang1497: yeah makes sense
[4:15:33] spiritking1987: but dundee content SadgeCat
[4:15:33] xxunicornxx99: Understandable
[4:15:34] hngryghozt: Civ gang def seems like ur speed
[4:15:36] gem02_: yea than an actual gang
[4:15:36] alcharvard: at least u got to experience it a bit
[4:15:37] gian_peachy: Is Fiona with Civ gang?
[4:15:54] sunnythedrunk: That totally makes sense
[4:15:56] dee_love16: idk who’s in civ gang other than vee and Jason
[4:16:02] spiritking1987: it not hard to tone it down when rp[ing with them ellum SadgeCat
[4:16:08] sunnythedrunk: @dee_love16 Raia, Clayton, Nunu
[4:16:23] clumsytom: and learn
[4:16:25] xxunicornxx99: Fairs
[4:16:25] hngryghozt: @sunnythedrunk also Alexander rivers and Eugene
[4:16:26] dee_love16: oh more sani probably
[4:16:31] jamesluong123: Dundee does make a long of enemy
[4:16:51] P_Herbo24: where did the guy you took to hospital go lol
[4:16:56] gian_peachy: Raia's team is just so chill
[4:17:05] mrloso47: Who flops?
[4:17:18] sunnythedrunk: Yeah they are one of a few gangs that Eli could realistically be in. There's another one but Eli doesn't have the meta unlock
[4:17:33] kalonrose: DinoDance i luv this song
[4:17:34] jamesluong123: that makes sense
[4:17:40] dee_love16: rolling with Dundee will get you catching strays for real tho because they likely will get in another gang war. like you almost getting ocean dumped but this time you’ll actually deserve it
[4:17:45] clumsytom: I don’t think they take the day to day too seriously
[4:17:49] sunnythedrunk: no yeah when you said you didn't want to do conflict rp seriously I knew it would never work
[4:17:49] hngryghozt: it makes sense,
[4:17:56] spiritking1987: nothing wrong bein side character tho YEP
[4:18:01] emrhys95: civ gang is a lot of shootin the shit but they grind too so its a good balance
[4:18:14] shivang1497: yeah think civ gang makes a lot more sense for you
[4:18:19] jamesluong123: Dundee does have a tendency to make enemies with everyone
[4:18:22] jamesluong123: a bot
[4:18:24] clumsytom: I doubt you would mess up their storylines. you’d be very low on the totem pole
[4:18:32] xxunicornxx99: Oh for sure
[4:18:45] faybz_: you click well with Dundee as an individual but I think the crew is a little too serious for Eli
[4:18:53] dee_love16: yeah I think with civ gang you’d be able to still hang out with Dundee kinda sometimes maybe
[4:19:03] sunnythedrunk: yeah the issue is the only person you click with is Dundee
[4:19:34] producedbyblu: civ gang probs the best since Jason’s the leader and he doesn’t take things too seriously
[4:19:42] kalonrose: yeah thats fair
[4:19:53] dee_love16: agree yeah the gang is very different than what you give off. I like Dundee and Eli out of gang relationship
[4:20:09] xxunicornxx99: Same dee I agree
[4:20:39] dee_love16: I’m not sure you will get much of that same relationship with Dundee if you join. just saying
[4:21:02] xcamelinax: KEKW
[4:21:24] gian_peachy: Dundee works with any gang, so I think he'll also get ur relationship and interactions

[5:32:22] shivang1497: yeah but he is gonna be robbing a lot of your friends.. are you okay with that
[5:32:23] sunnythedrunk: You basically want crim lifestyle without gang shit
[5:32:31] castusartoriuslucius: option 2
[5:32:31] spiritking1987: chaos and a gettaway driver OOOO
[5:32:43] Ma_Crow: he did it with yuno already so he knows how it is lol

[5:33:06] DollKnivez: Dundee came in clutch
[5:33:26] Chaotic13: Dundee saved this so hard
[5:33:54] hngryghozt: W DUNDEE
[5:34:05] Chaotic13: @hngryghozt agreed
[5:34:27] clintonio_oxide: i feel like eli would want to hang with them but not be a 'hangaround' officially
[5:34:35] P_Herbo24: for sure the second option, Dundee is great for recognizing the situation and taking control of it to make Eli more comfortable
[5:34:38] DollKnivez: twinkl49Laugh twinkl49Laugh
[5:34:40] spiritking1987: the patience of dundee peepoGiggle
[5:34:49] hngryghozt: @chaotic13 he gets it. he’s a veteran. and he was in a group called “soy boys” with Benji and Yuno LUL
[5:34:51] xxunicornxx99: gigl
[5:34:53] alphavvulf: dundee is daddy i never had
[5:34:54] castusartoriuslucius: just like he did Yuno
[5:34:55] owlskitties: EMURSEEEE
[5:34:59] sunnythedrunk: I think Eli only wants hang with Dundee but civ gang suits him much better
[5:35:33] clumsytom: chat don’t backseat
[5:35:38] witness2nv: cold feet
[5:35:49] xxunicornxx99: !backseat
[5:35:49] Fossabot: Josh is moving through the game at his own pace. Please do not tell him what to do in chat, if he needs help he will specifically ask :)

[5:37:48] david199915: Join the company
[5:37:55] xxunicornxx99: NODDERS
[5:37:59] amcbabyy: Dundee is OG can gets the mentoring aspect, the rest of the gang just RPs more seriously \
[5:38:01] DOWNBAD_ELLY: Dundee WANTS you to mess up and learn NODDERS
[5:38:02] ebbubble: it’s a learning curve
[5:38:11] shivang1497: think you should ask civ gang first if you can be a part of it, also everyone is new there so everyone is in the same boat. And civ gang also does all the robberies
[5:38:11] buukakay: you'll the hang of it. just takes a bit of time
[5:38:13] clumsytom: your rp is their rp. dont worry about right or wrong
[5:38:19] sunnythedrunk: You def civ with crim aspirations not gang aspirations
[5:38:24] raysmodernlife: I think you can get that same crim experience in a group that fits you better
[5:38:25] xxunicornxx99: Agreed clumsy
[5:38:26] Valroz: BBMC is a lifestyle its up to Eli if he wants that life they will teach you just have to want to learn
[5:38:27] ozzyfnyt: No xx @downbad_elly     c.  c.         n
[5:38:40] buukakay: sometimes people can also press you but its just a joke. you'll find out what the RP ''social rules'' are LUL
[5:38:45] ViewerNo13: I think if all of them knew Eli a bit better, they would've all went easier on Eli because they would've understood that he's a lighter character than usual + that he's new. I don't necessarily think it's just a Dundee thing but Dundee did come in clutch to save the mood of the scene.
[5:39:01] rose_7673: yes yes but I think they get you’re a newbie
[5:39:04] spiritking1987: Hmm the timing of this call
[5:39:05] david199915: Lmao let's go they're need you t rob
[5:39:05] Villenthessis: PepeLaugh
[5:39:06] DMATT_3030: Everyone in civ gang besides nunu and Eugene is new..
[5:39:11] dyslexia_have: PepeLaugh
[5:39:12] ajustus2801: you got stop worrying about that so much, you messing up is not going to mess up their rp, you worry too much
[5:39:19] shivang1497: you dont have the money lol
[5:39:27] sunnythedrunk: yeah it does help that vic gang is mostly newbies
[5:39:31] sunnythedrunk: civ
[5:39:44] sao_mito: Can we send clips here whipFlower
[5:39:44] freakinfe3n: Love hopping from whippy <3 whippy is a veteran rper and dundee's nickname in the server is tutorial dundee and he knows what he's doing and risks of taking eli under his wing <3
[5:39:46] jamesluong123: I think it also important to think about your rp too not just there and if your style will fit with there
[5:39:52] spiritking1987: you do over think YesYes
[5:39:57] clumsytom: if anything you added to their rp
[5:39:58] Lord_Machiavellian: Don't feel bad. Dundee wants to train you.
[5:39:58] alcharvard: Are u sure its not because you feel uncomfortable ooc?
[5:39:58] david199915: I thought his gonna invite u in the heist lmao
[5:40:01] KeyriBee: Social anxiety 🫡
[5:40:03] myrinity_: i think take dundee at his word when he says its no big deal
[5:40:19] hellfire_6843: Is Eli a member of BBMC ?
[5:40:28] 04_KieranStyles: you alright brother
[5:40:31] amcbabyy: Eli is just a different style of character, nothing wrong with either style!!
[5:40:38] P_Herbo24: Dundee was a W for taking control of the situation and making it more comfortable for you. and he enjoys you and that’s why he offered you that second options and still doing crazy shit with him when you can
[5:40:46] kosheeko: u cant ruin it! its still a storyline
[5:40:57] ojubu: I think they also know you’re green and they’re trying to “teach” you but the way they’re going about it stresses you out
[5:40:58] moonhui00: is that Apple rotten
[5:40:59] Villenthessis: nodd
[5:41:04] alphavvulf: they have to think of you as a civ wannabee gangster
[5:41:05] ajustus2801: worried youre the jarjar binks of the group
[5:41:10] shivang1497: think you should ask civ gang first if you can be a part of it, also everyone is new there so everyone is in the same boat. And civ gang also does all the robberies
[5:41:10] kosheeko: yeah
[5:41:15] david199915: Don't overthink about it .. whippy probably don't give a f about it lmao
[5:41:15] clumsytom: it’s improv. their is no ruining RP
[5:41:16] castusartoriuslucius: Dundee is not that serious
[5:41:17] xxunicornxx99: Yeah
[5:41:20] shivang1497: def of civ gang
[5:41:26] freakinfe3n: You're all good mate <3
[5:41:27] Lord_Machiavellian: Eli should steal a car now to have something to ram a cop
[5:41:30] myrinity_: yeah you're good <3
[5:41:38] amcbabyy: @kosheeko !!! That "serious meeting" or confrontation added to their story for the day
[5:41:38] goodghostgirl33: just a learning curve
[5:41:39] shivang1497: you dont lol
[5:41:41] jamesluong123: just probably just feel out of
[5:41:46] P_Herbo24: that’s for sure a civ gang vibe lol
[5:41:48] clumsytom: ez ban
[5:41:48] yogi201672: LUL
[5:41:49] shivang1497: nah dont think thats allowed
[5:41:50] itschicobueno: Don't over think it
[5:41:53] xxunicornxx99: @freakinfe3n welcome in Heyge
[5:41:56] david199915: Dundee literally definition of free person don't feel about it
[5:41:58] alphavvulf: yuno is like that too he is a gangster thats never serious
[5:42:02] GhoStTaLoN_: what the house mlos like
[5:42:03] spiritking1987: you got robbed of course you got no money OMEGALULDANCE
[5:42:07] jamesluong123: probably something to think about it for another day
[5:42:07] xxunicornxx99: Please dont over think it <33
[5:42:17] DMATT_3030: What's also funny is Eli would've probably learned all the crimes civ gang has done if he'd just hang with them more LUL
[5:42:22] 04_KieranStyles: how are you today brother?
[5:42:24] hngryghozt: the only way I would see eli being serious is if one of his friends like Yuno or Lottie gets seriously hurt or betrayed and it clearly shows
[5:42:30] ojubu: can someone loan you some money?
[5:42:31] spiritking1987: respawn it the taco truck YEP
[5:42:32] jamesluong123: Dundee was Yuno mentor so he could probably see

[5:43:08] Villenthessis: NODDERS
[5:43:08] monsterh308: Yuno would never be a good mentor, He'll just make Eli do Crazy funny stuff
[5:43:13] alcharvard: Does eli want to be in a group?
[5:43:15] spiritking1987: Hmm but dundee chaos tho
