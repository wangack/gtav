[8:01:25] Amenorino: @Deansocool your metabolism slows down during your sleep
[8:01:27] AlienatedFL: @Sulton_ LUL
[8:01:27] Gimiix: its to do with digestion
[8:01:29] 00bimalicious00: it's better to digest before you sleep
[8:01:29] T_Singh99: @alienatedfl it’s really not, you sleep better if your foods digested and your belly’s not working as hard
[8:01:29] fableeee: bro i cant sleep if i eat too late bruh
[8:01:30] cirocski: To digest the food right
[8:01:30] twest2021: Your body needs time to digest food

[8:01:34] 1_hannahh: puts strain on digestive system when sleeping
[8:01:35] Trixcross: you should try to eat 5 hours before bed to avoid gaining weight when you sleep @deansocool
[8:01:36] chmod_R_777: Joe Rogan told me
[8:01:38] jimborat: I've never heard that eating late would be bad
[8:01:40] twitchprimeis4free: your body cant rest properly
[8:01:40] JakoLegend118: your stomach is digesting it instead of resting
[8:01:42] LilianaEyja: do you want acid reflux?
[8:01:43] Dinomims: it takes longer to digest
[8:01:43] theblackdog808: I used to have nightmares when I ate super late
[8:01:44] JumpStartMyFart: let me get my nutritionist buddy on the keyboard
[8:01:44] Footballcj1: digestion causes poor sleep I believe
[8:01:46] captainlunaa: body has to work that food down while also trying to enter rem sleep
[8:01:48] Caeros: cause you digest for that long, after that laying down won’t be an issue otherwise you get indigestion
[8:01:49] Laminator6935: 2-2,5 hrs before bed… trust me i’m a dietetian

[8:02:04] ekbutter: @chmod_R_777  me
[8:02:06] AlienatedFL: @T_Singh99 okay that's at least a point about sleep
[8:02:06] enajd25: Were do you live UK or US?
[8:02:09] 00bimalicious00: true, but when you're asleep your body needs a diffrent set of nutrients than when awake
[8:02:10] ashleighoc: When we eat late at night, we tend to store extra calories from food as fat, and we don’t use stored fat as fuel. Our metabolism slows at night, so we don’t utilize energy from a late-night meal well
[8:02:15] LilianaEyja: @deansocool do you want to develop acid reflux
[8:02:21] Fizban_The_Fabulous: deceDance

[8:02:50] 00bimalicious00: it's why pepto is so poplular

[9:31:44] eeem234: mhm** lol
[9:31:45] Thraxton1: If Turner hears that she said fuck off he will probably want to to demote DeRolo, he mentioned that any promotions can be taken back if they dont live up to the expectations
[9:31:56] TheMah1337: @Rascal_PM no your just dumb, aziz told denzel he was gonna all that they both had the same story how is denzel saying what happened gonna get aziz in trouble
[9:31:58] improvisablex: @sterred Or she barely talked to him because she is not going to DAP him.
[9:31:59] AbeFroman2: turner gonna put his fat cock down KEKW
[9:32:02] kb420ps: What they doin'?  They're smiling in your face,  all the time they wanna take your place,  the BACKSTABBERS..............."
[9:32:11] BoldSlowbro: ??
[9:32:13] m4l1kkk: @abefroman2 what 💀
[9:32:14] j0k3rhub: YO CLIP CHANNELS make sure cpt meeting is on yt for me when i wake up in the morning lmaooooo
[9:32:29] sterred: @improvisablex either way, she doesnt respect him enough to have a proper conversation
[9:32:41] Topking10: snr gone to her head
[9:32:44] Zunnun: @thraxton1 the word will probably be twisted so sadly nothing will happen but lets see how the rp plays out
[9:32:46] Trixcross: you told the captain that you said that 'she can't tell me when I can or can't see my CIs' @deansocool smh
[9:32:50] improvisablex: @improvisablex Or you know, she is tired and doesnt need much of a conversation. You dont know.
[9:33:00] DisConfused: L leadership tbh
[9:33:00] sterred: @sterred dpas or not, a good captain would give someone a platform to unload
[9:33:01] lillukeii: is there a capt meeting today
[9:33:04] surelyURjokingMrFeynman: it's a secure vehicle
[9:33:04] AbeFroman2: that should wipe your dap away
[9:33:08] CobeDutyFree: Yoo what’s up Dean and chat
[9:33:12] Rascal_PM: @themah1337 you can’t even write a full sentence, look at you. Denzel did not paint the same picture as Aziz about Sonya being upset from multiple situations. rewatch the vod and get your hair out of the dirt
[9:33:14] SleepingLikeZenitsu: did she make those sops up?? KEKW
[9:33:22] J05l4H: Chatting
[9:33:28] chapoop_: @Deansocool if they try to get u for entering a vehicle u can mention how u and captain slacks entered mr k's house 5Head
[9:33:29] m4l1kkk: Aziz, Den and Cornwood have no chance in PD. They'll be fired by March 😂
[9:33:30] UncleJinx: Damn man. What happened to roleplay over Ruleplay sometimes. They going hard hard for cops this season.
[9:33:34] Sonicfear: Patrolling...not Ride-along LUL
[9:33:34] kb420ps: Ruth will make this stick.  All of Denzel's DAPs were over paperwork,  and Ruth made them ALL stick.
[9:33:34] ArmyOfFutsak: cant you speak to the liason officer?
[9:33:39] znpcness: vehicle is the DAP for sure
[9:33:43] feraldog7: where would employed cops be notified of such new rules?
[9:33:50] iLL_sKiiLLz: new car/
[9:33:50] LokiTheElusive: It's an armored secure vehicle not exactly a civ car
[9:33:53] TheMah1337: @Rascal_PM jesus christ get a touch grass bro you are so dumb XD
[9:33:55] iLL_sKiiLLz: ?
[9:33:58] AbeFroman2: she only talked to 1 civ too
[9:33:59] AbeFroman2: LUL
[9:34:04] surelyURjokingMrFeynman: Aziz is a smart man
[9:34:04] Caeros: thats demotion worthy, but certainly a dap for her
[9:34:04] FLCK3R: i hope she also talked to jason because you can hear from him when she said fuck off,so that's 3v1 against her
[9:34:14] sterred: @znpcness yeah getting in the truck was a BAD idea
[9:34:14] kb420ps: There's NOTHING you can do now.  You have to just wait and accept the punishment.
[9:34:18] KissMyAsthma_69: @kb420ps tbf, all 3 captains voted for those 7 DAPs on Denzel and it was unanimous decision
[9:34:19] Cait__17: dannie60Derp
[9:34:22] lillukeii: @themah1337 chill dude and enjoy the strea.
[9:34:27] surelyURjokingMrFeynman: Jason has a goldfish memory though
[9:34:29] m4l1kkk: Jason didn't snitch when he actually needed to 😭
[9:34:34] scootypebbles92: @kb420ps Good thing there are 2 other captains who will disagree
[9:34:36] williamwildcat: @FLCK3R she said she already did cause there were only 2 civs there, and she didntk now clayton
[9:34:37] LokiTheElusive: @FLCK3R There's no way NMP would have the memory to recall it unless Ruth asked directly if she said it
[9:34:37] Rascal_PM: @themah1337 relax
[9:34:38] Sonicfear: @FLCK3R She admitted it to Ruth, it's not even a question.
[9:34:42] pok3tg0d: what is the name of the officer they argued with?
[9:34:45] wiglaf__: are you sure you're supposed to be driving this car still btw? KEKW
[9:34:46] spyrouly: jason is the most important witness, he was near her
[9:34:46] AbeFroman2: Clayton needs to come through Prayge
[9:34:47] eaglezFly: @kissmyasthma_69 just isnt true
[9:34:50] THETHING777: new cop car????
[9:34:51] UncleJinx: @knxghtstrykerr Lol what news you watching cause they smoking dick
[9:34:51] supmybrutha: Anyone got a clip?
[9:34:57] m4l1kkk: Jason snitches on everything but not to save Den and Aziz 💀
[9:35:01] KissMyAsthma_69: Might be meta gaming, but they all agreed on it in the meetings they had
[9:35:02] eeem234: trueee
[9:35:03] FLCK3R: @FLCK3R well yea but to have more people against her is good for den
[9:35:05] Caeros: truuu
[9:35:07] BoldSlowbro: i love the drama,, but 80's over everything. lets get some
[9:35:07] TheMah1337: @knxghtstrykerr look at our full conversation i am trying to watch the stream he is just trying to stir the pot
[9:35:08] lakis_myk: GIGACHAD
[9:35:09] DisConfused: facts
[9:35:10] surelyURjokingMrFeynman: yeah Ruth is writing the report
[9:35:11] FLCK3R: @FLCK3R KEKW
[9:35:13] kb420ps: @kb420ps True,  but remember,  just last week Ruth wanted Denzel fired for perjury.  She's not going to stop until she gets Denzel fired.
[9:35:14] FossilizedWalrus: too bad nmp OOC has the memory of a goldfish, probably doesn't even remember what he heard
[9:35:20] chmbrs: KEKW
[9:35:21] Amenorino: @KissMyAsthma_69 agreed on what?
[9:35:22] dan_f900: aziz is eloquent with it ngl
[9:35:22] jockstarraidz: @KissMyAsthma_69 JUST LIE GIGACHAD
[9:35:23] sterred: @wiglaf__ he may as well make the most of it LUL last chance tbf
[9:35:23] FLCK3R: did i just reply to myself again? o7
[9:35:24] williamwildcat: @m4l1kkk true
[9:35:34] surelyURjokingMrFeynman: it was so fucking unlucky she was even at the money pick up
[9:35:34] AbeFroman2: she still has to talk to Clayton
[9:35:34] moe1124: shift 2?

[9:35:38] ridertmzzz: YO WHATS GOOD DENZEL
[9:35:38] Sonicfear: @FLCK3R mehdiWEIRD
[9:35:40] hyotee: @kb420ps @KissMyAsthma_69 ruth wanted 5 daps on denzel on the last incident so not really unanimous

[9:36:06] FLCK3R: @Sonicfear how the fuck do i reply to that KEKW it doesn't let me
[9:36:06] m4l1kkk: Jason snitches on the most irrelevant stuff on earth, but fumbled on a little convo to save 2 careers 😭
[9:36:09] raqsypoo: its even funnier if you have watched ruth's point of view on the interviews :D not gonna say anything but some good character arc there to watch
[9:36:09] hopevs2: denzel about to flip some burguers at snr buns omE omE
[9:36:12] eaglezFly: @kissmyasthma_69 if they did its because she didnt tell them that she approved the first operation over radio and left out important details
[9:36:14] kb420ps: It's just a matter of time,  but no one is perfect.

[9:36:50] kb420ps: They're going to give you and Aziz 3 DAPs.
[9:36:57] znpcness: < 3**
[9:36:58] serioushustle: you wont get anything for the sanya thing, you will get 1 for being in the truck
[9:37:01] FLCK3R: @AbeFroman2 wait rly? bruh could saved him
[9:37:07] OriginalAntiHero: your at 7 now and 10 is suspension?
[9:37:08] Switchblade142: what she say fuck aziz for
[9:37:12] UncleJinx: LUL what is she says she never apologized saying you made that up
[9:37:19] stew3161: Character development, maybe time for Den to grow a pair lol
[9:37:29] mizzikk2401: tbf I think Turner should have taken the statements since Ruth promoted the officer
[9:37:32] SliceeLifee: After 5 round, the judges come to a unanimous decision. 10 DAP to Denzel!
[9:37:34] BKBiggy: man not gonna lie this makes content
[9:37:36] sterred: @OriginalAntiHero i think its sacked no?
[9:37:36] npr3333: shift change time
[9:37:37] kb420ps: She apologized for telling you to "FUCK OFF".  The DAPs you and Aziz will get will be for getting in the back of the G6 truck.
[9:37:40] hyotee: JAIL BREAK??
[9:37:40] hopevs2: excuse me mr denzel, i want my burguer without pickles omE omE

[9:37:54] AbeFroman2: clayton save den Prayge
[9:37:55] znpcness: @kb420ps, NODDERS
[9:38:06] EGGZOLENTZ: @kb420ps teue
[9:38:06] Sonicfear: @kb420ps Bingo, zero to do with who said what or CI's.
[9:38:12] Rascal_PM: @kb420ps that should only be about 1 dap though. Sonya wanted 3 for insubordination
[9:38:14] keaton1588: has doug told u about rolled bills?
[9:38:15] xDeadxRabbitx: you heard what cornwood just said? Teemo escaped from prison again
[9:38:15] Xellwrath: @stew3161 ha, you have a better chance of resurrecting the dead than Den'Zel standing on bidness or growing a pair.
[9:38:17] OriginalAntiHero: @sterred oh im not sure i was trying to find out lol
[9:38:17] Abdullah_8499: @abefroman2 how?
[9:38:22] sillybunbuns: o7
[9:38:23] Zunnun: Dose cornwood know about this? deansoPeepo
[9:38:25] Troytd: o7
[9:38:26] Switchblade142: Yeah I would stress that shit hard that it's not in the SOP's at all
[9:38:26] Calmleee: didn’t they have a captains meeting today?
[9:38:28] EGGZOLENTZ: @kb420ps true but she should be getting dapped for being unprofessional
[9:38:28] feraldog7: where would employed cops be notified of such new rules?
[9:38:29] 0x000b: Clueless
[9:38:30] AbeFroman2: @Abdullah_8499 she still has to question clayton
[9:38:31] RTMoney1986: Talk to the chief
[9:38:35] sterred: @OriginalAntiHero Im intrigued too!
[9:38:45] wiglaf__: it's kinda common sense to not leave your vehicle without telling anyone tbf
[9:38:57] hyotee: maybe 1 dap across the board?
[9:39:04] nationas: o7
[9:39:04] Abdullah_8499: @abefroman2 I doubt she will
[9:39:09] Eraborea: it was a good run last cop stream Sadge
[9:39:09] sterred: @Deansocool what happens at 10 daps dude? is it just a suspension for a bit? or you kicked out?
[9:39:11] nationas: you had a good run brother
[9:39:13] AbeFroman2: 1 dap for all would work
[9:39:16] SleepingLikeZenitsu: @wiglaf__ you gonna comm every single time you leave the cop car?
[9:39:19] kb420ps: @EGGZOLENTZ It's a "Chain of Command" thing.  The captains are going to back Sonia because she is a senior, and a newly appointed senior.
[9:39:22] Vince_dev_: 1 DAP each
[9:39:27] npr3333: it was too loud of a situation for 1 dap across
[9:39:28] Switchblade142: @sterred High command reviews the officer
[9:39:28] 0x000b: Clueless
[9:39:29] EGGZOLENTZ: @wiglaf__ not really if u have back up, you should be good
[9:39:31] talgach: @sterred HC discusses if the individual with 10 daps get fired or not
[9:39:34] xDeadxRabbitx: TEEMO ESCAPED PRISON AGAIN
[9:39:35] Rascal_PM: yeah 1 dap makes sense, but if you get 1 dap she gets 3
[9:39:35] nationas: you will get more daps than her calling it right now
[9:39:36] SuuWasTaken: +1 DAP is still a suspension for u tho
[9:39:37] znpcness: PepeLaugh
[9:39:37] Zunnun: @wiglaf__ i am playing deansoEvil but if i went to get food as a cop its o7 for me?
[9:39:39] DanLGG: Leaving the car unattended MAYBE but there’s no way y’all get punished more than her
[9:39:43] AUXY_1: @sterred Suspension pending review from high command, could result in firing
[9:39:49] dan_f900: no but Ruth said to@you about 3 needing to be approved by all captains
[9:39:49] Zunnun: @wiglaf__ cause i didn't tell anyone
[9:39:50] m4l1kkk: She needs a half dap too
[9:39:52] OriginalAntiHero: @deansocool also wondering what happens at 10
[9:39:54] aleman98: and she still gets to be a senior?
[9:39:57] dan_f900: why say that without meaning
[9:39:57] SuuWasTaken: every DAP after 5 is a suspension IIRC @Deansocool
[9:39:58] sterred: Ty chat for responses! <3
[9:39:59] II__LuKaS__II: yeah 3 sounds like a huge breach of SOPs
[9:40:00] Sonicfear: Literally departmental 101... Leaving Vehicle, RideAlong in a civilian vehicle with out communication or authorization and with implicit orders to do so.
[9:40:07] tyler__96: when do you start losing the first daps you got?
[9:40:07] AbeFroman2: no shot is Turner going to allow her to get away with saying fuck off in public
[9:40:09] aleman98: every dap after 5
[9:40:10] Citystar619: Common sense though why are putting urself in a vehicle and letting other officers know...G6 couldve said you set them up esoecially with that dirty money in the glove department
[9:40:11] EGGZOLENTZ: @kb420ps true but if denzel cussed out a cadet he would be in trouble and dappes. They cant play favorites in a situation lile thar
[9:40:12] Sonicfear: without*
[9:40:12] DisConfused: 8 Daps is crazay
[9:40:18] danielb2705: Has to be 1 dap you and aziz and 3 for her
[9:40:18] EGGZOLENTZ: Like that*
[9:40:27] wiglaf__: @Zunnun if you go to the docks from the southside to get food, yeah you should
[9:40:31] m4l1kkk: 8 daps is insane, you're beating Cornwood 😭
[9:40:35] npr3333: don
[9:40:36] AbeFroman2: aziz shoulda pushed that theres no SOP harder, den wouldnt of course
[9:40:41] monkz89: ruth will push 1 DAP for you for the truck sitting, 3 for AZIZ for gun and vest, and MAYBE 1 for sonia
[9:40:41] j0k3rhub: every dap after 5th its 24h suspension
[9:40:52] SuuWasTaken: yeah im pretty sure every DAP after 5 is a suspension
[9:40:53] wiglaf__: IM JUST SAYIN BRUH GET OFF MY ASS
[9:40:53] m4l1kkk: Most DAPS in PD - Den Sheisty 😭
[9:40:55] Diables: When u will be on crime? we got stuff to do xdd
[9:40:57] lajmenno: Think Ruth will try to articulate "They should know this is not to be done, regardless if it's written or not" kinda deal
[9:40:59] sterred: @danielb2705 She shouldnt be dapped, she should be demoted
[9:41:01] Dr_Darksnow: Dean stop thinking on how the situation went and think about how the captains think it went. thats how the daps will go
[9:41:01] Chaoszero_goc: If it was 1 dap could she just do it now?
[9:41:03] Xellwrath: If you get a DAP now, wouldn't that make you the DAP King? With the highest amount of DAPs? KEKW @Deansocool
[9:41:04] aleman98: @monkz89 noway he gets it for the gun
[9:41:10] ParashootTV: She should get a dap for sure or it's super fishy. If you gad said what she did then you'd get fired
[9:41:11] m4l1kkk: You've got the most DAPs? deansoP
[9:41:11] DanLGG: y’all also go great intel from showing them the g6 bill. they said oh yeah that’s what the crims get when they steal our loot
[9:41:13] chelseafc_93: Enjoy the car while u still got a job lol
[9:41:16] marneraiders: Can’t wait for turner reaction to the „Fuck off“ LUL
[9:41:18] AUXY_1: I think this is amazing RP. Gonna end up in some juicy conflict. Turner and Ruth already end up fighting or snapping at each other everyday
[9:41:18] Zunnun: @wiglaf__ ight i just wanted to know your thoughts that means everyone in pd should have daps deansoP
[9:41:20] kb420ps: @EGGZOLENTZ I'm telling you,  they will back Sanya.  The MOST she will get is a verbal warning.  They will let her slide because she's a new senior.  Watch how this plays out.  I'm not saying it's right,  but just watch how this plays out.
[9:41:31] Rascal_PM: go report that cvpi lol
[9:41:31] SuuWasTaken: Cornwood threw a 7-5 lead
[9:41:36] wiglaf__: @Zunnun they should tbf
[9:41:40] m4l1kkk: Bro is top 1 on the DAP leaderboard 😂
[9:41:43] monkz89: @aleman98 aziz might since sonia is saying he brandished, not den tho
[9:41:50] AbeFroman2: @kb420ps no shot Turner lets her get away with unprofessionalism as the king of professism.
[9:41:51] SuuWasTaken: Cornwood even beat a 7-4 lead
[9:41:59] adrian_md46: @Diables Dean joins peepoPolska ? Pog KEKW
[9:42:10] ItsSkaara: He hit the pedal real hard
[9:42:11] MisterBrojangles: run in without doing comms
[9:42:17] Zunnun: @wiglaf__ fr deansoF o7 pd deansoP
[9:42:18] m4l1kkk: PhD in Dapology, 8 daps in 1 month 😭
[9:42:25] EGGZOLENTZ: @kb420ps im sure, Ruth will more than likely speak in her favor, shes seems antiman NotLikeThis LUL
[9:42:40] Trixcross: @deansocool you said it wrong to cpt ruth, you didn't say that you said 'I don't think I need your permission to meet a CI', you told Ruth you said 'I don't think you can tell me when I can or can't meet my CIs' which is WAY worse
[9:42:51] EGGZOLENTZ: @kb420ps i wouldnt be surprise if she compromises herself for her
[9:42:56] Citystar619: Cornwood is working on it so you know you wont hear nothing
[9:43:00] m4l1kkk: Averaging 2.4 DAPs a week 😂
[9:43:02] kb420ps: @AbeFroman2 True,  but Slacks won't want to give ANYONE DAPs.  So it will be 2-1 in favor of Sanya.
[9:43:02] AbeFroman2: LUL
[9:43:09] moe1124: ??

[9:43:27] adrian_md46: expected Daps XDP LMAOO
[9:43:28] steven_even853: I don't think you will get any DAPs, Aziz and the senior officer might, though
[9:43:30] Chaoszero_goc: Turner will be pissed she said fuck off
[9:43:34] EGGZOLENTZ: @trixcross i dont think it matters to Ruth, the issue was them leaving their car
[9:43:40] AUXY_1: @kb420ps There is no way in hell Turner votes in favor of Sonya when he hears what she said
[9:43:42] nationas: LUL
[9:43:43] Rascal_PM: 2 daps for you, demotion for Sonya, 3 daps for Aziz
[9:43:43] the__misfit: TURNER WILL FIRE HER
[9:43:45] dan_f900: warning he says
[9:43:45] chmbrs: LUL

[9:44:07] Switchblade142: Yeah you really need to stress that to them that's important
[9:44:08] kb420ps: @kb420ps I agree.  Turner will not be in favor of Sanya,  but Slacks and Ruth will.
[9:44:08] Trixcross: you said the permission thing which is better, but you told Ruth the can or can't thing which is pretty insubordinate @deansocool
[9:44:09] dan_f900: they’ll just make it up though its Ruth

[9:44:18] marneraiders: Turner will Execute her probably DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance
[9:44:18] EGGZOLENTZ: @deansocool i think the biggest issue is she didnt even opp to educate yoy
[9:44:19] SleepingLikeZenitsu: true but she was real hardstuck in the you had no backup part Dean
[9:44:19] monkz89: ruth didnt even ask for claytons last name, shes gonna use the 1 witness who said he didn't hear shit and leave it at that, she gonna stack the story 100%

[9:44:36] LJD420: Turner is all about professionalism he won't be happy about this at all especially since it happened in front of civs 󠀀
[9:44:38] npr3333: she took the situation to 11 with the fuck off
[9:44:39] LokiTheElusive: I bet Ruth will cut out the part where she says "fuck off" and change it to "yells at officer shiesty" or something omE2
[9:44:40] Janman88: COMMS ?
[9:44:42] Strupset: there is a problem about you leaving the car and sitting in the civs vehicle i suppose
[9:44:42] Xellwrath: o7 Chase
[9:44:43] znpcness: not that you can't do it, but when you do you comms it
[9:44:47] JustinBinder: yeah you cant charge somebody with a charge that dont exist
[9:44:48] Switchblade142: You don't convict suspects for laws that don't exist should be the same for daps
[9:44:48] rayhxxn: That van moving
[9:44:53] AbeFroman2: she might have told you guys not to do it, she could use that as defense
[9:44:54] DanLGG: it 190% matters. The same as criminals being able to carry around dirty money because there’s no legislation for it.
[9:44:55] Rascal_PM: all this because you didn’t respond to Linkle
[9:44:57] wiglaf__: the cpts will say what i said, that it's ''common sense''
[9:45:04] m4l1kkk: The system is against you 💔
[9:45:07] Dr_Darksnow: you disrespected the senior and argued in front of others that what the captains know, thats the truth they know
[9:45:15] YungKingUtch: @EGGZOLENTZ I don't think she ever opted that way even after all the daps
[9:45:15] LustigCoder13: bruh i just happend to be watching both povs when this started up OMEGALUL
[9:45:18] znpcness: Risky maneuvers have to be comms'd so other officers can provide assist

[9:47:28] ItsSkaara: Good luck
[9:47:29] Xellwrath: o7 Goofy hahaha
[9:47:32] znpcness: omE
[9:47:34] moe1124: lmaoooo
[9:47:34] m4l1kkk: @zunnun he's averaging over 2 daps per week, it's inevitable sadly BibleThump
[9:47:36] Xellwrath: its nautreN
[9:47:42] Drmarshmelluw: o7
[9:47:42] AbeFroman2: @monkz89 no shot do the other caps let ruth only question 1 witness tho

[9:47:44] ahmedtak5224: is that ramee
[9:47:48] wiglaf__: is it goofy o7
[9:47:48] DanLGG: can Ruth give 2 daps without other captain input or are all daps reviewed by 3 captains
[9:47:54] Dunker: Just wait o7
[9:47:58] nizmo_ttn: This just shows its just the car frr
[9:47:59] EGGZOLENTZ: Why are they running again
[9:48:02] zaseroz: its goofy o7
[9:48:03] Sonicfear: @Switchblade142 They teach it in the ingame Academy, protocol as to securing of vehicle, when you leave the vehicle for what purpose, communicating location and activity in said location, seeking authorization for operatoins outside the norms of patrol.
[9:48:06] Rascal_PM: smaller vehicle for Copium
[9:48:07] akonv3: @DanLGG all review

[9:48:35] LJD420: @Rascal_PM no he isnt lol, Aziz has 0 daps and is articulating the situation very well without bringing emotion into the situation
[9:48:38] LokiTheElusive: How is no-one else out here NOOOO
[9:48:41] YungKingUtch: it was getting dangerous

[9:49:19] Rascal_PM: this is like the End of Watch for Denzel and Aziz, they about to get murdered
[9:49:30] kb420ps: Only a captain can initiate a DAP.   So,  Ruth will initiate DAPs for Aziz and Denzel.  She won't initiate a DAP for Sanya at all.  Then,  the other captains will vote on what to do with Aziz and Denzel.  Sanya won't even be in the conversation.
[9:49:33] EGGZOLENTZ: @natas_ttv no backseating fam

[9:51:31] feraldog7: when do all the captains meet to discuss this?
[9:51:33] TwoFaceHeavy: so crims change into bicycles now and they getw ? gotcha LUL
[9:51:35] Batmooooon: PepeLaugh surely speed matters when it’s goofy
[9:51:37] EGGZOLENTZ: @nationas thats not the point if she call denzel right after she already made her mind up and didnt even think about it
[9:51:39] B_Ro11z: Anything is fair with neutren
[9:51:40] n3zz1e: chase content not Ws
[9:51:57] RainDxM_: who was he chasing?
[9:51:59] kb420ps: @aleman98 That's just my point.  She's not getting a DAP.  Ruth won't initiate a DAP.  So,  one of the other captains would have to do it,  and I don't think they will because none of this happened on their shift.
[9:52:13] CourageTheCowardIy: buddhaW why’d you stop madafaka?
[9:52:17] wiglaf__: @feraldog7 when they're all online at the same time which might take days
[9:52:22] m4l1kkk: DQ, Vivek, Patar and Moses in 1 car would be an earache LUL
[9:52:23] CornrowKenny__: @RainDxM_ lang

[9:52:38] hosseinfel: who was it?
[9:52:38] AbeFroman2: @kb420ps if Turner can give 1 dap to sanya, hes going to, my bet is he would
[9:52:40] Sonicfear: @kb420ps Yea fact is, had they left their patrol unit and got into that civ vehicle without communicating it. The subsequent even would have occurred.
[9:52:41] improvisablex: !meta
[9:52:42] Streamlabs: Don't tell Dean information about other characters that he does not know in game. He cannot do things if it is said in chat and he sees it. Sit back and just enjoy the rp.
[9:52:42] Fossabot: Don't tell Dean information about other characters that he does not know in game. He cannot do things if it is said in chat and he sees it. Sit back and just enjoy the rp.

[9:53:24] scottbotsharp: I thought you had that car for an hour ?
[9:53:24] monkz89: @kb420ps not if ruth wants to keep up the "i only follow SOPs" persona. shes forced to at least consider DAPing sonya
[9:53:27] Sonicfear: @kb420ps Sorry, meant, "Had they not"....
[9:53:33] Topking10: as aziz should

[9:54:22] SkyMercury: @Lampro blue hair officer go reeeeee
[9:54:23] kb420ps: @monkz89 She's going to say that she addressed it one on one with Sanya,  and that she doesn't think she deserves a DAP.  The other captains will agree.
[9:54:25] monkz89: @RobotsAndMaltLiquor she already apologized to him, and even said she was out of line
[9:54:31] ItsSkaara: Sus

[9:55:50] DisConfused: HOOD ROBIN INCOMING
[9:55:59] kb420ps: @AbeFroman2 I'm not underestimating Turner,  but if it comes to a vote,  I think Turner will want to give Sanya a DAP,  Ruth won't want to give Sonya a DAP,  but Slacks is the difference.  Slacks won't want to give ANYBODY DAPs.
[9:56:12] AbeFroman2: yeah but he doesnt need the other caps vote for a dap

[9:57:18] kb420ps: @Zunnun Yeah,  but he's been riding the fence between Ruth and Turner.  Especially since that last meeting they had.
[9:57:20] Rascal_PM: I think this almost confirms the shift 1 spies suspicion Den had about Ruth right?
[9:57:21] adrian_md46: Denzel: "Permission to make content?" 💀
