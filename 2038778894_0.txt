[2:15:37] Deciousdark: Anything with Whippy is comedy gold hehe
[2:16:26] mystic_drewman: You have to be healthy to be on death row so eat up 😆
[2:16:32] Snow_Bow14: Its just so funny to see Crane giving 0 f's but Whippy getting actually gaslighted by him going full Smurf

[2:37:31] Kentuckybluegrass: honestly, getting a gang member to plead guilty to felonies would be good for investigation/case building
[2:38:51] Wizzdumb: Yeah other than the proof, there's no proof!
[2:39:29] Kentuckybluegrass: because the transfer of firearms is legal and untraced, I’m waiting for the “I lend it out every Wednesday” argument

[3:14:20] Holcrafter: this dam light house
[3:14:38] DeceitWithin: Did Nolan ever stare at a goat or two?
[3:15:26] Wizzdumb: The CIA back then were basically just big kids with lots of money and a sandbox lol
[3:15:33] Wizzdumb: Well and probably still now
[3:15:42] Kentuckybluegrass: yup… the CIA had a lot of interesting projects. They tried everything and anything
[3:15:46] recklessgallifreyan: Damn invisible irradiated water
[3:17:26] Kentuckybluegrass: “the men who stare at goats” is one of my favorite US military topics of just wild shit
[3:18:12] abstractDramatic: Just randomly dosing each other with LSD is one of the funnier things they did
[3:18:15] rachelkachel: very much a case of throwing things at the wall to see what sticks
[3:19:05] TheZyzyva: hey in ww2 i believe it was great britain had an actual stage magician making calls and came up with plans that saved the day on multiple occasions
[3:19:46] Wizzdumb: It wouldn't surprise me at all to hear that the CIA still learns basic magic skills for sleight of hand and what not
[3:19:50] Wizzdumb: Seems useful
[3:19:55] Samuraiyeti: ooh ww2 was crazy
[3:20:47] TheZyzyva: my favorite being when a base was going to be bombed, he built their exact light structure about a mile away, and had the base kill their lights at night so the enemy kept bombing the fake base at night
[3:20:59] rachelkachel: my favorite ww2 story is when they made a whole fake officer, found a guy who had died of pneumonia so he'd pass for having drowned, gave him fake invasion plans and dumped him in the ocean for the germans to find
[3:21:39] TheZyzyva: ww2 actually full of plans straight outta a DnD session

[3:28:53] DeceitWithin: Only the most devious of licks
[3:29:04] Wizzdumb: Bet it takes less than 2 minutes
[3:29:28] DeceitWithin: Not sure if it's just folklore, but apparently there's one coke plant in Mexico that still uses the original recipe, quokka AAAA
[3:29:49] DeceitWithin: Well

[3:43:23] Wizzdumb: Aliens! WutFace
[3:43:29] Wizzdumb: Ah okay
[3:43:38] Fastburn_: Miss kidkiki
[3:43:42] SilentRequiem94: There has to be a way to fix the issues caused by alot of people in one spot, right?
[3:43:56] SADSev: Mask on mask off usually fixes it
[3:44:27] Wizzdumb: The only issue with fixing it, is that there's no way to know if you're showing kiki face
[3:45:05] SilentRequiem94: No I mean like a server side fix. Its stability issue, FiveM servers  can only withstand so much per say
[3:45:12] SADSev: I think it's when a zone is over 32 players cause that's what a zone is meant to handle. Don't quote me but I think that's what it is. It's not pulling all faces
[3:45:12] rachelkachel: it also doesn't always affect everyone, sometimes you'll look fine to one person and kiki face to another
[3:45:35] Wizzdumb: Does it ever affect peds?
[3:45:48] rachelkachel: KEKW
[3:45:50] Wizzdumb: lol
[3:47:11] SilentRequiem94: @Wizzdumb The kiki face peds is whats hidden inside humane labs... the radiation is simply a coverup Kappa
[3:47:29] Wizzdumb: That's horrific
[3:48:04] SADSev: My low key favorite part of kiki face is the color changing har. Cracks me up
[3:48:14] Wizzdumb: Yeah that's good
[3:48:53] Wizzdumb: He's got drugs on him
[3:48:53] Fastburn_: Didn't Shovan get messed up like that on day 1?
[3:48:56] Wizzdumb: Looks worried
[3:48:59] SADSev: He's hoping ya'll don't find his weed stash xD
[3:49:15] rachelkachel: and then there's the invisibility glitch that nancy and a few others had
[3:49:17] Wizzdumb: SADSev read my mind
[3:51:04] Wizzdumb: Yeah the police SUVs...
[3:51:14] SilentRequiem94: So well I asked cause it seems some FiveM servers can handle more people in one spot than others
[3:51:15] SADSev: Built different
[3:52:40] Kentuckybluegrass: the chase started right next to the highway, so I give them credit for not just highway blasting lol
[3:52:50] Kentuckybluegrass: they’re taking a fun route at least
[3:54:46] Wizzdumb: LMAO
[3:54:59] Snow_Bow14: Nolans lines are better. Nice keeping up
[3:55:22] Wizzdumb: SUV has racing slicks on it or something...
[3:55:38] Wizzdumb: Hits the dirt and just stops
[3:55:47] rachelkachel: WICKED
[3:56:05] Snow_Bow14: Makes no sense that the muscle car has traction off the track though
[3:56:19] Snow_Bow14: The spinning out is logical, just the straight line speed is BS
[3:57:28] SADSev: Sabre kinda got some speed to it

[3:59:29] Snow_Bow14: True
[3:59:44] SADSev: Her heart do be tho after that taser xD
[3:59:48] theconvictedquokka: Nolan tackled a mfer so hard they died
[4:00:04] SilentRequiem94: Now they are a rock and rocks dont go very fast
[4:00:08] Wizzdumb: New bragging rights?

[6:09:18] theconvictedquokka: @silentrequiem94 breathe in the flavour ... all meat are lungs
[6:09:38] kannakamuilover: I always nearly crash the plane and by the time I’m done with a car it barely runs
[6:09:42] theconvictedquokka: @kannakamuilover I fly better then I drive
[6:11:05] kannakamuilover: but as Franklin I’m pretty ok just can’t control the throttle as well as you can with controller just gently tap and  the engine purrs
[6:11:51] theconvictedquokka: But then again after 5k hrs of arma and squad anyone is a great flyer
[6:12:09] thesupremepotato1: yep

[6:15:04] kannakamuilover: I know right, it makes controling the car so much smoother rather then just revving the engine

[6:16:45] theconvictedquokka: Helicopter is separate hotas
[6:17:03] rachelkachel: it's a shame you don't have a quota because you'd be nailing it
[6:17:08] kannakamuilover: cars are not a problem but the controls for flying on pc are a nightmare
[6:17:16] theconvictedquokka: Now we talk to Gerry about highway patrol
[6:17:42] theconvictedquokka: @rachelkachel I mean quotas are illegal as heck
[6:18:21] theconvictedquokka: I think the only countries with quotas for the popo is Indonesia China and Russia
[6:21:28] NewIronsides: I remember a few years back a local pd in Alabama got in trouble or was in the news for supposed quotas they had

[7:44:49] TheeForsakenOne: The VU been open most nights. LUL
[7:44:50] kannakamuilover: it’s good money Candii made a like a thousand in 1-2 hours
[7:44:54] kannakamuilover: lana
[7:45:05] kannakamuilover: not bambii
[7:45:53] adzno: OMEAGL
[7:45:54] Tensua_: LUL
[7:45:55] adzno: OMEGALUL
[7:45:58] theconvictedquokka: Gemma stripper by night serial killer by day
[7:46:09] rachelkachel: yep fair
[7:46:18] kannakamuilover: it seems it’s only good if there is a lot of people at a party
[7:46:18] adzno: Yeah I've avoided the VU since ONX and 4.0 opened with letting people work there
[7:46:42] adzno: I mean mechanically, a lockpick could last you until it naturally degrades
[7:47:07] adzno: I wanna say a week?
[7:47:13] adzno: Feels like most things in the server take about a week
[7:47:47] kannakamuilover: more then likely they were doing suggestive content and which is not just dancing Candii did no naughty things unless laying down on a bed and staring at the ceiling is bad
[7:49:21] HorribleHog: GTA, but not so often
[7:49:30] LoneWolfRacing77: does it wheelie?
[7:49:43] adzno: I feel like the 1000s of hours I have in rhythm games give me an unfair advantage when the lockpick gets harder LUL
[7:50:05] kannakamuilover: well she also has mature content labeled as mature content so that’s also a thing
[7:50:15] kannakamuilover: can’t be blamed for that can us
[7:50:20] kannakamuilover: ya
[7:51:05] theconvictedquokka: I really feel like if Gemma got a connections she wouldn't choose one gang but be a killer for whoever has coin
[7:51:49] Ohiosveryown: does not seem worth the 400 unless it goes to not having to buy Cabs, renting cars
[7:51:51] adzno: Oh lord is it rare
[7:51:51] kannakamuilover: that’s an assassin or bounty hunter which is a job I think
[7:52:16] kannakamuilover: but you have to be in the know with the rp shit and stuff
[7:52:18] HorribleHog: Very inconspicuous with the mask and long, vibrant green braid LUL
[7:52:21] rachelkachel: bounty hunter is a job, yes. you need a license
[7:52:26] theconvictedquokka: @kannakamuilover ooh bounty Hunter would be a good Gemma job
[7:52:34] modzyuk: Mr Dahmer, Collins reporting for  duty ;)
[7:53:06] Tensua_: so are the cops just getting a bunch of carjacking pings for this?
[7:53:10] kannakamuilover: ya but like he said she is a criminal not a vig
[7:53:23] kannakamuilover: like they care
[7:53:31] kannakamuilover: no one bothers with these anymore
[7:53:43] kannakamuilover: not unless it’s like a super expensive car
[7:54:00] kannakamuilover: maybe they pop by
[7:54:21] modzyuk: I've been very well my friend, real life hit like a truck after COVID, what about yourself? Keeping well?
[7:54:45] kannakamuilover: Collin you sound familiar
[7:54:52] kannakamuilover: were you 2.0 or 3.0
[7:55:11] rachelkachel: occamNote
[7:55:13] theconvictedquokka: I'm just happy here in Australia reptile rescue  is a mandatory job
[7:55:54] HorribleHog: do backpacks give extra inventory space?
[7:56:07] HorribleHog: Or just part of the outfits
[7:56:09] Ohiosveryown: not many ppl have printers,
[7:56:20] kannakamuilover: they should
[7:56:25] modzyuk: I feel like I speak for a lot of people with that sentence - Kanna, I've never actually played NoPixel, myself and Occam both met many many years ago on an old server, I trained as a cop under Occam when he was Sgt/LT there, very very good times indeed.
[7:57:06] kannakamuilover: your name rings a bell I just can’t put my finger on it
[7:58:01] Tensua_: i did not know apprised is a word and i've heard it like 4x today
[7:58:14] modzyuk: I'd say about 5 years now, you had been there for a few months longer than me
[7:58:29] modzyuk: back with the 32 slot servers LUL
[7:58:32] adzno: I'm super glad that GTARP Blew up as much as it did. I don't think I'd still be gaming these days if I didnt get sucked in myself into it all
[7:59:16] kannakamuilover: i remember a bombing on the highway and a Collin was supervising with another guy
[7:59:16] rachelkachel: that's gonna make it hard to steal their packages
[7:59:19] theconvictedquokka: I might be aging my rp experience but 32 slot servers were a dream when I started
[7:59:28] Ohiosveryown: yea no one will ever do delivery atm
[7:59:30] kannakamuilover: don’t know if it was you my bad
[7:59:44] kannakamuilover: like ya said it was like 5-6 years ago
[7:59:45] modzyuk: @theconvictedquokka I agree, everything felt a lot more personal
[8:00:17] modzyuk: All good Kanna
[8:00:27] LoneWolfRacing77: can you eat locals?
[8:00:52] theconvictedquokka: @modzyuk agreed I joined one recently but it was more I'm only promoting my friends and everyone else cab get bent
[8:01:02] Ohiosveryown: eveyrone just gets robbed and then fired
[8:01:03] theconvictedquokka: Can**
[8:01:04] kannakamuilover: people have been poaching them before they get delivered by grabbing them from the job and selling them
[8:01:30] kannakamuilover: their is a gang doing that I think
[8:01:46] kannakamuilover: no one delivers anymore
[8:02:04] kannakamuilover: rp is rp so ya
[8:02:10] TheeForsakenOne: Sounds like something Greco would go after.
[8:02:11] Ohiosveryown: if s1 sees someone deliveryng, they follow and rob
[8:02:22] Ohiosveryown: then if u get enough robbed, u cant take the job lol
[8:02:24] Ohiosveryown: vicious cycle
[8:02:25] Chiracho: roba cop and kill a bank?
[8:02:55] theconvictedquokka: Roba cop kill a hospital
[8:03:10] Chiracho: ot bad for a quick sani job
[8:03:13] Chiracho: not*
[8:03:14] rachelkachel: that's more than half a lockpick! occamLUL
[8:03:28] kannakamuilover: thing is this was an rp sting they did so I’m not sure if it was sanctioned but ya
[8:03:46] kannakamuilover: more then likely it was
[8:04:27] kannakamuilover: so then it’s already handled they just did a one time thing
[8:05:05] kannakamuilover: regardless this mayor election needs to happen like NOW, no one can make real money and stuff is getting more expensive
[8:05:39] kannakamuilover: only way to get money is gov jobs or events
[8:05:54] kannakamuilover: I have been watching a lot of streamers so ya
[8:06:06] Chiracho: man gold prices aint doing well in LS eh?
