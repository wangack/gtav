[3:29:32] Vidbel: I use a bipap
[3:29:32] jyefyog: 10 pm steak hits hard
[3:29:35] Zyteus_: Auto cpap, it changes pressures throughout the night
[3:29:36] DissidentzTV: Spaceboy, did they give you an AHI number? When I did my study I had a AHI of 83.
[3:29:36] BloodDemonDesh: PartyHat Happy Partner anniversary! spbDABESTWIGGLEONTWITCH
[3:29:36] dreaminghappy: APAP is like a cpap but it only is on when you are breathing in, so when you are breathing out it does not blow air
[3:29:39] horsingaround858: blaze it
[3:29:42] l0lz0mbi3: APAP is not constant air
[3:29:45] l0lz0mbi3: So y
[3:29:47] hugh6719: one pressure that changes itself depending on what your current apnea needs
[3:29:48] BloodDemonDesh: BloodDemonDesh subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 29 months! spbDABESTWIGGLEONTWITCH
[3:29:50] Zyteus_: Same thing but much better
[3:30:01] ricepuffer: yeah theres different types of CPAPs they work in dif ways
[3:30:05] glitch_250: Bipap is what I use
[3:30:17] Zyteus_: Yes
[3:30:17] RyleyD: They both work in a similar way, but the Apap is a bit more precise?
[3:30:18] l0lz0mbi3: APAPs are a lower than CPAP
[3:30:20] ricepuffer: yeah
[3:30:22] NibblerofWorlds: What is the Ferrari of the PAP machines?
[3:30:23] sammo84: when you mentioned micro sleeps earlier I was like yup that's me 100%
[3:30:23] Deakula: CPAP = constant pressure, APAP = pressure ONLY when breathing in. Yes, that's APAP
[3:30:26] PhantmK: Yeah, nearly all Modern CPAPs are APAPs
[3:30:33] Spaceman_Honkerton: BIPAP is a better CPAP.
[3:30:36] Zyteus_: I have the resmed airsense 11 which is an apap
[3:30:37] ngg12: My dad had that then lost a bunch of weight and no longer has needed it for years
[3:30:41] hugh6719: Most CPAP pressures are auto adjusting.  you may like 5-20 cmH20 better than starting at 4.  some people feel like they are starving for air starting at 4
[3:30:41] fatgingi: @Spaceboy there is Cpap (constant pressure) there is BiPap (just two levels of pressure, inhale and out) then there is auto, which is just variable
[3:30:41] l0lz0mbi3: APAP is auto. CPAP is constant
[3:30:45] mjohansen34: yes I have an Apap. it auto regulates the amount of air pressure throughout the night based on what your body needs. it‚Äôs so cool
[3:30:59] DissidentzTV: Yeah Resmed, I have a philips right now.
[3:31:04] SwedishCurry: @Spaceboy One tip of advice that im almost sure you already know, sleep under the influence of cannabis is a bad sleep, it disrupts the natural sleep-cycles even tho it might feel real good to fall asleep when baked ;) It really hinders the bodies functions for recovery during sleep, same goes for alcohol. When i learned this years back, i made sure i had no edibles/smoke 4-5 hrs before sleep and my life actually changed drastically. Anyways, just hope youll be ok <3
[3:31:12] NibblerofWorlds: Does the BiPap machine come in the proper rainbow colours?
[3:31:24] GrimAngel01: might seem obvious but make sure to clean with sterile water and not just from the tap. high risk of bacterial infection otherwise
[3:31:35] MrBroma_: I use the ResMed airsense 11
[3:31:50] Zyteus_: Distilled water is the best to use
[3:31:52] DissidentzTV: Distilled
[3:32:12] DissidentzTV: Its like 1-2 bucks for 4 litres and lasts like a 1/2 a month or more for me.
[3:32:24] theblackcanary9745: I had a dream that was similar to James running around with the box of babies but instead of the box it was a gonk droid
[3:32:28] NibblerofWorlds: ‚Ä¶ dude, the start of that sentence was kinda scary with you talking about having to go to the bathroom but when you were awake enough‚Ä¶

[3:32:46] RARA_cht: you ever wake up in the morning, sit up in bed, then fall back asleep sitting up? that's how I found out about my sleep apnea, kept happening. Well that + I felt like crap all the time
[3:32:55] bictious: @Spaceboy Do you have older relatives you've been around? Because James acts SO much like my grandmother did before she passed
[3:32:57] Volanii: My mom was told not to use filtered water and to only use distilled water for her cpap
[3:33:03] Deakula: Yeah, always go distilled for CPAP
[3:33:08] DissidentzTV: Yeah, only use distilled.
[3:33:09] VR_NULL: filtered water should not be used with a cpap
