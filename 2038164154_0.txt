[1:16:01] Spankinator: Yeah I've seen Myles trying to talk about/solve as much as possible IC instead of OOC command talks
[1:16:10] ritaribeiro0: Candice handing out strikes like candy was hilarious lmao
[1:16:12] rathan_reddy: conflict in RP DANKIES gets cucked in occ discord wolfaUgh

[1:18:02] Sylar996: OMEGALUL
[1:18:05] stianvn: I remember u saying command was so easy compared to what u did in an IRL job
[1:18:06] Fluffy_Violin: OMEGALUL
[1:18:07] happydaze86: thats management in rl too lmaoooo
[1:18:08] Dan_S__: command is literally managing a bunch of streamers/zoomers pretending to be cops OMEGADANCEBUTFAST
[1:18:08] Mr_Hipe: OMEGALUL
[1:18:11] InspectorBacon: so far ONX drama has been like non-existent from a viewer perspective so the admins must be very on top of things if there is anything happening

[1:19:28] RGeneral24: you will have to be more strict
[1:19:34] rathan_reddy: its restrictive for sure YEP
[1:19:34] Spankinator: I wonder how different command is on ONX mylesHmm
[1:19:39] Kheys_: you made it into character, it's kinda hard
[1:19:41] TheSauceShaman: the ONX sargeants feel very much like their own characters i've noticed
[1:19:42] SkiingGod: Sheriff Pred was famously by the book
[1:19:48] moo_of_doom: its easier when the character is in comedic terms "the straight man" where you are the oh no wtf are you crazy kids doing person
[1:19:55] happydaze86: onx feels so much more open to pd actually being full characters
[1:20:00] TheSauceShaman: people like Connie, Bloom, Orabelle
[1:20:18] magic_freak: NODDERS
[1:20:24] DarthVeigar: YesYes makes sense
[1:20:34] moo_of_doom: NP they were too often treated as game mechanics and not characters
[1:20:34] stianvn: did u get that "command" feeling when pred talked to Nova yday?
[1:20:43] OrangutansLibrary: It feels like the whole server focus really is on RP rather than specific commercial interests for the biggest streamers tbh
[1:20:43] RGeneral24: tbf Candice in her current state should never been even Solo with the amount the work she done LULW
[1:20:54] Dan_S__: sgt candice showed up a little OMEGADANCEBUTFAST
[1:20:55] magic_freak: Soon to be in command of the entire city wolfaM
[1:21:01] Spankinator: I've really been enjoying ONX PD peepoHappy less ping chasing all the time
[1:21:02] SkiingGod: For the greater good

[1:21:45] stianvn: Maybe underwood shows up again
[1:21:46] Kroykumzz: Pain
[1:21:46] RGeneral24: it will be a while until ping chasing happens
[1:21:50] Kheys_: Candice just feel the flow, it changes, why not
[1:22:04] OrangutansLibrary: can't wait for 'ouse cleaning; that petty crime stuff created a lot of RP
[1:22:09] TheSauceShaman: i've heard some cops be frustrated with not getting backup and people not being on radio
[1:22:10] jesi__viya: Among us
[1:22:13] MrRonald234: Bike unit NODDERS
[1:22:13] magic_freak: Bicycle unit

[1:22:16] kevsnor: Bicycle patrol
[1:22:17] Yuna08: Bycicle unit YesYes
[1:22:22] moo_of_doom: crime is so unprofitable that getting caught hurts too much for fun chases, but thats the problem with it being early
[1:22:22] MiskyeXD: air1 :)
[1:22:24] vortexTMG: air corps lead wolfaEZ
[1:22:29] RGeneral24: LULW

[1:23:45] ben0809: Hii belle and chat
[1:23:46] vortexTMG: Candice being the lead of the SRU equivalent on ONX would be poetic justice

[1:24:31] PattyIce3: and now you have the added factor of “she only got it because she’s an admin” which won’t be fun

[1:27:32] blacknightp4: I mean is a new server why not try new things
[1:27:39] Kheys_: Candice place seems good
[1:27:42] ritaribeiro0: i think the most enjoyable about   the server is that you legit meet so many new people instead of recycling the same old people. its great to interact with entirely new people and enjoy the rp without the baggage
[1:27:45] Sylar996: no point boxing youself in
[1:27:54] totonred: The RP developing organically has been good to watch
[1:28:13] OrangutansLibrary: run out of new things to try?

[1:29:21] UltamaZ: it feels less cliquey
[1:29:21] JohnJKnapp: not having Pings to chase has really opened up everyone’s ability to meet new people. i always felt like the long chasing kept everyone stuck in their cars and not seeing a lot of things
[1:29:24] moo_of_doom: i always say hi to people that walk by, stop for people running if they need a ride, pretty much always been a positive too peepoHappy
[1:30:00] mochahearts: Thats why I didnt play there. i felt like an outsider LUL
[1:30:03] ritaribeiro0: @UltamaZ def less cliquey and feels a lot less like theres already groups formed that you struggle to even try to interact with
[1:30:04] TheSauceShaman: its been kind of crazy to see how open every random person is to interactions
[1:30:06] magic_freak: The gang app was good mechanic but it k8lled so much interaction
