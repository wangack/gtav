[3:16:19] TheMah1337: ruth is a good officer but a bad captain, she has too many problems with the citizens and the officers, McNaulty should be the captain of mrpd, Cornwood sheriff, Slacks troopers, and turner chief or police

[3:55:41] kuroyasha3: making it better to turn
[3:55:42] yourfavoritekoala: ask him to reverse
[3:55:43] Dareka1111: wrong, manual is best for performance driving
[3:55:46] BDG_Toa676: Ay OG what's Zyn
[3:55:49] slikybender: I’m sponsored by ZYN
[3:55:51] blowaways: its more control, but its so much harder

[3:55:54] slikybender: it’s my job
[3:55:56] BadRabbits: hands on lethal

[3:56:25] matanzlatan2000: howdy
[3:56:28] tenaja22: nah its better for pursuit too, in theory. its harder, but if you can do it, you can do it.
[3:56:29] BadRabbits: also it's either manual with a clutch, or sequential with no designated reverse.
[3:56:30] hey_007: it will be hard to learn to master it but then it would be better
[3:56:31] Zev______: Aziz the real GIGACHAD
[3:56:31] Dareka1111: stopping, turns, accelaration, all faster will manual
[3:56:32] slikybender: everybody knows ZYN’s come on cuh

[7:58:10] mercs99: @mercs99 depends on the wording of the law, thats why i am asking. but if i were being assaulted and wanted to flee and saw a group of people i probably would run to them and ask for help or for them to move lol
[7:58:10] quinnio1412: lol
[7:58:14] stellarnaut: They both good but the judge has to consider if she wants people to stab other people after they get punched

[8:00:35] stellarnaut: @rascal_pm how could you articulate that your only choice in self defense against a un armed person is to pull out a knife and stab them lol

[8:02:33] Rascal_PM: @stellarnaut her lawyer gave her the opportunity to articulate exactly that but she admitted to there being 7-12 seconds of time between attacks, which is enough time for her to run away. at first Clayton had said her reaction was within a second or two which is why she pulled the knife and didn’t run

[8:04:09] stellarnaut: @rascal_pm my point is she can't say she has "no choice" as if she was compelled to stab the guy. It's more realistic to say she did not think of another choice in the time LOL
