[0:19:55] TossTheBomb: @anshu2907 yah
[0:20:02] re4mcore: Looked like organic chemicals
[0:20:08] DoctorLAW590: looking at the list, a lot of the compounds have alcohol as byproducts if you burn out the rest
[0:20:14] c000ls: or gotta binge watch Moonshiners
[0:20:22] UltimateWeirdo: @anshu2907 yeah
[0:20:22] glumpyblacksheep: "How to grow weed" "How to make moonshine" "What to do when the FBI kicks my door in"
[0:20:25] Zaicor01: it's a puzzle
[0:20:34] BobiHouzmeister: im sure there is something on reddit
[0:20:46] OriginalGibsta: have they determined if recipes between two different people are the same?
[0:21:16] RenTheRock: probably random seed stuff mixed with time put in
[0:21:17] EshaneDharmaPunx: @OriginalGibsta good question
[0:21:17] re4mcore: Gotta balance the chemical formula NotLikeThis
[0:21:18] Rool_Gonzalez: all the methyl/ethyl are alcohol
[0:21:35] DoctorLAW590: yeah, you have to actually balance the compounds to get the right byproducts
[0:21:40] YoDarrell: I think you just roll 1/18 6x and see what happens
[0:21:40] Rool_Gonzalez: etanool is baic spirit tho
[0:21:44] roesslerm: @OriginalGibsta yes. but i dont know if harry knows the answer.
[0:21:49] c000ls: LOL
[0:21:51] YoDarrell: roll a dice for each element lol

[0:24:14] DoctorLAW590: qL, mQ
[0:24:30] FiniteResources: maybe you're stripping out some ingredients and each variable is a step
[0:24:42] FiniteResources: like how you'd extract things out of weed
[0:25:00] Rool_Gonzalez: @DoctorLAW590 add the mto formula and see what outcome is and by products ;)

[0:26:40] DoctorLAW590: lots of strange things can help you make moonshine haha
[0:26:41] SchlepRock99: actually a still just boils out the alcohol already in the liquid you are cooking.  you aren't actually doing any of the fermentation in a still.

[0:27:08] KcsBack: Exactly it'll be rando
[0:27:11] crushedbybooks: Yep
[0:27:13] DoctorLAW590: how are you prohibited from using the same recipe?
[0:27:14] FiniteResources: damn NotLikeThis
[0:27:25] UnluckyPhil: exactly, the compounds is just bait LUL
[0:27:29] Rool_Gonzalez: have you seen movie called "The 51st State"? there guy too made narcoticum that i nTESTS showed good promice,but mixed together was harmlöess powder
[0:27:31] Korathor: Its basically meth but more sliders bit less amounts
[0:27:49] marthfool: makes sense most ppl who make moon shine have their own recipe
[0:27:51] mike9904_: harrNODDERS harrLIME harrNODDERS harrLIME harrNODDERS harrLIME harrNODDERS
[0:28:00] Sword_Scream: Also worth noting that people think too much about the ingredients. Like chemicals change properties a lot with other chemicals or states
[0:28:02] DoctorLAW590: are there other variables than the compounds?  like how much of old corn/fruit?
[0:28:06] jshwan: harrRat
[0:28:13] Rool_Gonzalez: noup,those are locked @DoctorLAW590
[0:28:22] osheryohanan: The way to make the perfect mixture is the same, but the ingredients and amounts are different, so you might be able to use logic. If it's just luck it's terrible
[0:28:23] DoctorLAW590: interesting
[0:28:34] Sword_Scream: I meant, chemicals, my bad :D
[0:28:46] Rool_Gonzalez: 5x5 varieables give you only like 3100isah combinations Kappa Good Luck
[0:28:58] idea_guy: be sure to add a lil apple and cinnamon to get the apple pie moonshine PogTasty
[0:29:00] jshwan: better that its static, would drive people mad if quantity was another variable LUL
[0:29:17] sbarnard5: harrRat harrRat harrRat
[0:29:24] c000ls: al those chemical are probably used for moonshine you just have to find the one that works for your character
[0:29:24] Rool_Gonzalez: then every nimber would make it more then 10x more variants
[0:29:30] DoctorLAW590: my copium tells me there's an inherent logic to it

[0:32:47] Rool_Gonzalez: 250 people on server,maybe 1/5 cooks moonshine so everyone testing one recipe per storm still get Weeks of try and error :D

[0:33:15] IGotItFromMyMam4: its a lot of grinding in town, but i like that there are a lot of different stuff to do for everyone
[0:33:26] abbylauren: how long does it take to make a recipe?
[0:33:38] Rool_Gonzalez: 5 seconds
[0:33:46] xxTOPPExx: Cook time as well
[0:33:57] goodtimes54: if everyones mix is different i wonder if thats the case
[0:34:13] crushedbybooks: If thats the case, I would leave out the inorganic chemicals, (chromium, vanadium, bromine)
[0:34:19] idea_guy: Can you use water from the weed grow as an ingredient?
[0:34:31] jbeazy850: if that’s the case of 5 bad and 5 good it would have to be different 5 for everybody since recipes are not the same?
[0:34:31] Mattyd777: @mike9904_ thanks
[0:34:32] mike9904_: LUL
[0:34:41] EshaneDharmaPunx: What if Rb needs to be mixed with a diff chemical to be good though?
[0:34:41] mike9904_: @mattyd777 of course blitzerPat
[0:34:42] thegavinator3000: 3125 combinations  if 5 are good?
[0:34:44] KCKingdom_: whiskeyriver1 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[0:35:04] LivingManiac: can u use 2 of a compound?
[0:35:05] PaganHeart: Did you ever check to see if position mattered? Such as shifting your whole recipe one to the left, carrying over the far left to the right? or just flipping it completely around or maybe just a pair around?
[0:35:13] Rool_Gonzalez: 50 cooks 2x in 24H is 30 DAYS of trying to test all recipes monkaMath

[0:35:35] OriginalGibsta: Maybe its not even order just the 5 ingredients

[0:35:55] jbeazy850: that’s what I was thinking too
[0:36:07] Rool_Gonzalez: exel
[0:36:10] PaganHeart: I still think order matters and certain pairs could mathematically, if they have like line intersect formulas or something
[0:36:13] Korathor: harrBOM harrWarry
[0:36:20] bike_rider99: 1 yaer min
[0:36:27] bike_rider99: year*

[0:36:43] OriginalGibsta: Try your below average in ingredients in a different order and see if you get a below average?
[0:37:04] Korathor: It would be funny if the order also matters

With this you don't have that, you only have a vague sense of whether you're in the 80th percentile or 40th percentile by telling you a general area.

[10:00:51] Aumilly: harrNODDERS harrRat harrNODDERS harrRat
[10:00:51] TastyKudzu: One thing worth testing would be 2 cooks with the same ingredients in different orders to see if order matters.
[10:00:51] PkTwo187: that was flashes strategy but marlo talked him out of it bc theres 100k+ possible combinations

[10:02:03] Aumilly: WeSmart
[10:02:04] jadedwrong: how many permutations again?
[10:02:12] TastyKudzu: If you can eliminate 5 ingredients you go from 100,000 combos to 3,125 combos.
[10:02:26] IvyOlive: the other issue would be is if the “bad ones” combined with other make the magic combo  alone could be bad but mixed could be right
[10:02:44] The_Howling_Wolf_ADAM: hey chat … been outta the loop for a bit. how is the moonshine working
[10:03:14] TastyKudzu: It's also important to figure out if order matters or if it's just the ingredients. So 2 cooks with same recipe but different order could be really valuable too.
[10:03:23] PkTwo187: ^
[10:03:29] MkMarkou: ^
[10:03:39] KcsBack: Trust the process harrPray
[10:03:57] eddieb0822: that’s a good point. it’d be like actual brewing because you add different things at different steps
[10:04:05] CaptainQuirkalot: I doubt order matters but worth testing
[10:04:24] mike9904_: I thought order did matter blitzerHmm
[10:04:38] PrismaPalma: have you tried doing one just with corn?

[10:06:18] Aumilly: Har scavenging for shine ingred in Swrs. Search for perfect shine recipe continues. Sunny call: saw the trash loot fliers har posted in Swrs & RatKing not happy, Har will remove them b/c they r useless & didnt work, told her hes not goin to fall in line behind RK just wants to get shine recipe & move on, she said >16 bottles on u is felony. Testin theory of brewing with set of single ingred to determine if naturally good/bad brew to eliminate use of bad ingred. Highest brew so far = below avg

[10:15:42] TastyKudzu: So as far as combination math: order matters & duplicates: 100,000 order matters & no duplicates: 30,240 unordered & duplicates: 252 unordered & no duplicates: 200

[10:17:17] eddieb0822: maybe the ingredients are a hint? it totals to 5 parts (2-water, 1-rotten orange, 1-rotten corn, 1-rotten bread) 2wz, 1rc, 1rb, and 1 whatever sugar is

[10:18:44] Aumilly: @mike9904_ LUL thats smart
[10:18:47] TastyKudzu: My guess is that each chemical component has something like 4 or 5 hidden values and you're combining them all to try to hit specific targets on those values. Imagine something like taste, purity, acidity, etc. If so that makes it much more difficult to solve then meth in 3.0
[10:18:54] PkTwo187: dont they call beer pisswazzer in gta?
[10:19:00] PkTwo187: wazzer? 🤔
[10:19:07] eddieb0822: well rb would be rotten bread
[10:19:09] xainho: wazzilion
[10:19:14] eddieb0822: rc rotten corn
[10:19:53] TastyKudzu: The main reason I think that is because it makes it much harder for someone to make a webapp that you plug 3 test cooks into and solves it for you.
[10:20:14] eddieb0822: can’t help but feel skeptical of all the chemicals since they’re all pretty outlandish. so maybe were overcooking

[12:35:23] No_Sneezing: small ones also easy to handle
[12:35:34] DEagleEye: @zer0cool1138 the grimes trunk is quantum entangled with its cargo
[12:35:50] zer0cool1138: gotcha
[12:35:50] DEagleEye: or atleast it was last tsunami
[12:36:42] zer0cool1138: it seems weird they added the weight limit stuff if you cant use the truck to smuggle. It's just to handicap civ workers lol
[12:37:03] DEagleEye: they fixed the weight stuff packer was back to 5k
[12:37:22] DEagleEye: and they fixed the scuff with the contracts showing incorrect weight
[12:37:33] zer0cool1138: ah
[12:38:02] DEagleEye: but mayors office is putting a legal limit afaik
[12:38:33] jshwan: LUL

[12:39:24] zer0cool1138: like goofy said it's just looks like a way to give cops a reason to stop you randomly
[12:39:40] Firepokachu: meanwhile a bison carrying wood is ok but not the giant truck
[12:39:50] Firepokachu: thats funny
[12:40:01] DEagleEye: @jrizzledoo well irl trucks go through weigh stations but in the absence of that it would make sense for cops to be able to pull trucks over just to check
[12:40:11] zer0cool1138: remember out checking storefronts storages went in 3.0 lol
[12:40:11] DEagleEye: wait and see what they do

[12:55:01] DEagleEye: the weights from the contracts were also wrong before
[12:56:09] grizzlybonk: WeirdChamp
