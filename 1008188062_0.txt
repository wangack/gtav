[0:44:32] friedmombo: make an even hundred and itd be easy to keep track
[0:44:32] cvaga: nah cuz then bronze and gold will be about the same rarity
[0:44:32] HyenaDip: I'd say just have "gold" versions to reduce the amount. and have them be a rare roll. but plausible?
[0:44:32] CplDarkeye: truuu @KingPresiden 4Head
[0:44:33] ChonkDonkulious: maybe its something dean can make to have it auto do it when they open a box or something
[0:44:36] ICEEJO3: imagine an employee having over 100 figures on them

[0:44:46] Drax_1X: maybe only a few cards have rarity?
[0:44:46] wtking21: Should make it weighted. Gold should be harder to gt
[0:44:48] ItsTrunzo: You could look at like how MTG does their rarity system with like commons, uncommons, rare, and mythic rare
[0:44:50] Tweker: rarity by number, not by odds KEKW
[0:44:53] StrawB3rriHime: @cyb3rflare thanks!
[0:44:55] phodell: You could then have HOA as the only true "PSA" graders of gold silver and bronze.
[0:44:55] Veldo0809: It'd have to be like 1 in 10 for Gold 1 in 5 for Silver
[0:44:56] bob_the_user: I had an idea of putting them in the top shelf at random just to have people buy top shelf
[0:44:56] xacktastic: then you could set prizes for bronze sets, silver sets, gold sets, and complete sets
[0:44:56] Valaphar: 1/6 for rarity or sth 6=gold, 5-4, silver, 1-2-3 bronze
[0:44:59] THRILLAZILLA: or something like with Pokemon where they have Alolan variants, it would just be "Mirror Park" variants uhnKek
[0:45:05] Cross0utlaw: shiny ant
[0:45:07] Tuckerbonage: @uberhaxornova atleast you know now that you can pretty much have over 150 now no problem
[0:45:11] dr_enthusiatick: @xacktastic he has one downloaded I think that the idea was to see the roll in game for suspence
[0:45:22] Niney_Who: @UberHaxorNova D6 could work better. 1-3 Bronze, 4-5 Silver, 6 Gold
[0:45:22] MStxnce: @UberHaxorNova maybe do like 1/6 1-3 for bronze 4-5 for silver and 6 for gold
[0:45:23] wtking21: Roll 1-9. 1-5 is Bronze, 6-8, is silver, and 9 is gold. or something like that
[0:45:25] MandalorianSpy: 1-15 (Bronze) 16-21 (Silver) 22-25 (Gold)
[0:45:25] jp_31a: Csgo knifes all over again
[0:45:27] Drax_1X: Maybe only like 10 cards even have a rarity? @UberHaxorNova
[0:45:30] Tandyman: The real problem is storage, you need them to add a storage case item that only works on merchandise
[0:45:30] jkimsleep: 1/6 for rarity or sth 6=gold, 5-4, silver, 1-2-3 bronze
[0:45:32] ASomewhatLargeBabyRhino: Roll out of 100 for rarity. <50 normal, 50-75 silver, 75-99 gold, 100 Diamond/Platinum @UberHaxorNova
[0:45:34] bigblast181: 1d20 with 20 being gold 13-19 silver
[0:45:35] WYF_NA: PepeLaugh
[0:45:37] Esseraf: It would be one in 240 to a gold
[0:45:37] jonahking24: James isn’t thinking like EA Sports or 2K lol they make it impossible to get the rare cards
[0:45:40] ChonkDonkulious: Maybe after all the numbers are in, you can give it to dean so he can make like a lootcrate that will pull one automatically so you dont need to keep track of 300 numbers lol
[0:45:44] prismbreak_: PepeLaugh 4
[0:45:45] steventheseagulll: you could do a secondary roll of 1-10. 1 -2 is gold. 3-5 is solver and 6-10 is bronze.
[0:45:46] DSrlaagyoenr: for rarity, a roll 20, 1-10 bronze, 11-17 silver, 18-20 gold, that way its weighted
[0:45:47] HyenaDip: You're going the Crazy Bones/Gogo's Route.
[0:45:47] ItsTrunzo: The dice rolling method seems like it would be an easier method
