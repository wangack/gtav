[1:31:28] Fossabot:  whipStinky Please do not tell streamer what to do or how to do it unless specifically asked by streamer, even if he forgets or doesn't see something. Back-seating acts as an unwanted external influence to the roleplay.
[1:31:32] Cleartrax: if you can sort it's not "powerful"
[1:31:33] NekoJPawz: you could check the destination on each bottle, its just a shortcut?
[1:31:35] Redoxxed: its just slightly less tedious
[1:31:37] OpyPhupapy: They are labelled
[1:31:39] T3nryuu: Is there no container with more slots where you can put those bottles in? Like 100 slots for 100 locations.
[1:31:45] woolfdesign: Doesn't seem exploit-y to me at all
[1:31:57] PartialBloom: everyone does this so if they don’t like it they will patch it right
[1:32:04] Valroz: If this was real you could see the addresses at a glance and sort them together
[1:32:15] Ushety: maybe they come with a note on them say "sell to X"and thats how cops know they are for sale
