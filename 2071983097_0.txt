[1:53:57] VojtechStrnad: this will take a while
[1:53:58] Cold_War_Goat: that‚Äôs quick weird‚Ä¶ why would jumping be the thing to progress out of all things

[1:54:42] mansgonemad: abseiling is technically climbing lol
[1:54:46] just_pop_off: jump times = 1
[1:54:46] imgoodwithusernames: called it
[1:54:47] m17bully: Why is there even a oxygen bar in this route if there ain't one in the other route
[1:54:48] VojtechStrnad: the rooftop approach
[1:54:51] jorglepiff: couldn't you have held the jump button the entire time to speed this up
[1:54:52] Fossabot: @KOOLKOLTEN, Please stop saying the same thing. [warning]
[1:54:56] CSGONobody: maybe down repelling down the side

[1:55:10] ch0sen01ne: dviperNerd walking is same as jumping
[1:55:11] CSGONobody: arent u being shot at thus having to go quickly?
[1:55:13] CursedS0uL: dviperHmmm
[1:55:13] galactichere: philosophical KEKW
[1:55:15] DraelTheGodEater: yeah technically all walking is just flat climbing
[1:55:17] obese_microwave2: stop using ur college major
[1:55:18] atomyess: Viper is it ok to drink expired milk?
[1:55:18] carltonseventeen: this is just vertical walking backwards
[1:55:18] ctrl_the_system: Matt getting philosophical on us
[1:55:19] bad4life: Technically walking is climbing wait
[1:55:20] trims3: You're litteraly just exiting the vehicle in the other one, like you've done earlier in this run

[1:55:21] lkzj1: hey matt i got a tip for you since youre a new player, if you press space then your charcter will actually travel upwards, hope this helped :) :) :)
[1:55:22] drdustmust: slowge
[1:55:22] tahoo14: so no walk challenge when
[1:55:26] seekingtreasure: wow so you failed the challenge before you even started the game smh
[1:55:27] neonel47: Lmao we going Einstein
[1:55:27] just_pop_off: misfit28DiggingIt
[1:55:27] KenseiBael: ts obvious that rockstar has a Time Machine and knew would do a challenge like this and coded the game so you can fail
[1:55:28] classix106: he's twerking with style tbh
[1:55:29] imgoodwithusernames: Walking = jumping
[1:55:30] TwistedxxFreedom: he's walking sideways with style

[1:55:58] LzyElephant: There was one no?
[1:55:59] m17bully: What is even the point of the Oxygen bar in this route?
[1:55:59] VojtechStrnad: Franklin has plot armor
[1:55:59] CondensedCanOfMeat: I like react content. Some kinds are objectively lazy, and its easier to make than other content, but the idea that it's stealing viewership requires significantly more data to prove. Right now it's just a bunch of conflicting anecdotes from people on both sides. And it being lazy doesn't really make me want to ban it. It ultimately comes down to axioms
[1:55:59] LzyElephant: Just now
[1:56:00] DraelTheGodEater: man theres gonna be so much rubble fallen beneath you by the time you get down
