[4:14:13] SmokyMcdope420: couple buttcoin per hot run would be great
[4:14:14] j0n_b0n: truu i thought that since the first day of the hot runs
[4:14:17] GimeDepusiBoss: LETHIMSCHIZO
[4:14:20] LudIkrIZz: so people like dundee can do crime too omE

[4:14:34] alex871012: to be different i guess shrujj
[4:14:39] SmokyMcdope420: yuno and ray were talking about bidding earlier as well its a great idea

[4:14:57] Snackboy898: @Titan911 tbh its first come first serve like once an hour so its not terrible
[4:15:06] austinj30: Practice roof running Prayge
[4:15:14] Shadowhaox: Bidding would never happen, that caters to the people with the most butc and isnt fair. two devs already spoke on that matter on their streams.
[4:15:28] imshade_x: Time Check
[4:15:41] jesscdcc: @Shadowhaox but they need a change, rn its just who has the best latency

[4:16:31] DarkZizou: Yh I think buttcoin bid will be fun and something new to trial rather than this failed method
[4:16:32] odie721: who’s car?
[4:16:45] Shadowhaox: @jesscdcc yeah Tobii and MoonMoon both talked about them needing to change the system and fix the scuffs of needing to refresh and such

[4:19:03] 234yh: @alex871012 well the choice has to be made, will devs cater to people who spend time on server or on those who doesnt, it may be cruel but prio exists for a reason

[4:19:49] 9kingsqillin: W Benji Moment
[4:19:50] Shadowhaox: @jesscdcc yeah..... its a big L but they are aware and want to fix it up. They might just make it like the Laundromat or cash exchange where its a lockout per HQ group and increase butc amount.
[4:19:50] alpasoup1: Wasn't cau a gang member
[4:19:54] china_whyte: "someone kicked it it doesnt work"
