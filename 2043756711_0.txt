[4:06:18] kyle8594: Dang I didn't think cut coins would sell for that much I feel like 2k max but people would end up buying it anyway at a higher price
[4:06:18] SadriiGaming: should do a subscription service for WiFi.
[4:06:40] Light1stNight: @SadriiGaming this is actually good
[4:06:42] juicexgx: @sirkilIalot the necessary one like smokecrack + more butcoins
[4:06:42] mrperson1234: @kyle8594 buttcoins are super hard to come by for the noob players.
[4:07:20] Bill_Collector: Buy high sell low
[4:07:24] kyle8594: @mrperson1234 I wouldn't think so cause don't you get 1 per day
[4:07:30] mrdumpling420: Did Marty decide against joining langs crew chat
[4:07:33] luckerooni: one thing im thinkin is if someone reliable will sell pre-installed apps then less people will even want to deal with massive server farms just to get crim apps
[4:07:34] Mehscope: @kyle8594 i mean you shouldnt devalue the price of butc just because you have a lot of it
[4:07:36] Light1stNight: the earlier the better
[4:07:38] kayneechan: This is
[4:07:44] am_kuro: Marty will join
[4:08:12] mrperson1234: @kyle8594 You get 1 per day and need like 25 to set up a crim network. Most people dont want to wait 25 days when they can spend 5k to cut that time down by a day
[4:08:16] kyle8594: @mehscope true they would be the first to sell it they can set the base price at whatever
[4:08:16] kayneechan: This business is gonna come clutch when police is going to start seizing shit.

[4:13:01] Swatifly: Jackass
[4:13:01] gunblade00: !backseat
[4:13:01] Fossabot: Do not backseat. Backseat gaming is telling Omie what to do or giving unasked for advice.

[4:13:08] khadka9860: nah jamal the smartest one
[4:13:19] Mehscope: i feel like in the end selling straight btc would be the way to go, probably later down the line
[4:13:20] Stepanov370: buh
[4:13:27] crownberriess: @settjungle1 joining and doing thier own thing that would help anyone join Lang grow
[4:13:38] isitreallynecessary: Marty and Yuno together on sales will be unstoppable
[4:13:59] gunblade00: @Mehscope would be nicer then if they jus had alot of racks and pcs.
[4:14:03] mrperson1234: @isitreallynecessary Yuno is a traitor he could never trust him

[4:15:23] lizard189: yuno has made like 40k on computer part sales alone imagine how much money this business idea can generate
[4:15:29] isaiahcpf: That's exactly what Yuno is doing right now. Like minds think alike.
[4:15:39] gunblade00: aaah whole the whole basement since the ground floor for casino.
[4:15:53] LDUBHUB: are we ever going to gamble ?
[4:15:53] mrperson1234: @luckerooni People act like it will be 1k per 1power. There is no possible way that mining buttcoin gains you less income than power costs
[4:15:54] talund: yuno giving away free wifi with purchase lol
[4:16:25] pizzapieninja: you should invite mama in the meeting so she feels involved
[4:16:47] Palizangetsu: @mrperson1234 Probably more like 100 per power
[4:17:08] chibi10011: The wifi is excess anyway, whether included for free or not nothing changes, it just mkes the deal more sweet

[4:17:42] revenueprofit: damn where are all the new chatters coming from rn
[4:17:44] TropicalToucan: @mrperson1234 hopefully its just a power bill and not like a power bill, a heating bill, etc. I dont think its like that but who knows
[4:17:47] JeenYuhsChris: Wait is it possible to track each person butcoin wallet so when you sell pre builts, you save the name of the person who bought it with wallet info so you know who wallet is who's for HACKERMANS later? @omie
[4:18:00] mateoHRV: omie can you erp now
[4:18:06] LDUBHUB: are we ever going to gamble ?
[4:18:18] revenueprofit: @JeenYuhsChris holy shit thats like collecting data
[4:18:21] mrperson1234: @JeenYuhsChris They could. That might be big brain tbh if later on you can hack into wallets
[4:18:24] CDabmaster: we'll know the true value of buttcoin when the first power bill hits
[4:18:39] thumphah: too many people involved no?
[4:18:41] chibi10011: @cdabmaster  true
[4:18:43] DangersClose: Whats the delay on the casino launch?

[4:18:54] Suleman_aftab: with yall joining with lang that means yall have 3 house
[4:18:54] mrperson1234: Need at least 80btc/d
[4:18:55] thumphah: Margins will be small
[4:18:57] penguin092: 100%
[4:18:58] luckerooni: the thing is this business will keep solving a problem that keeps coming up over and over again until every app is released
[4:18:59] isitreallynecessary: Yuno had a very similar idea so it definitely can‚Äôt be a bad one
[4:19:03] brokenbeam: worth doing a sample run for sure
[4:19:04] bonewp: yeah but you have to do it quickly because many people are starting to get they setup
[4:19:06] brikbeans: This is the best ethical scam since casino
[4:19:07] thumphah: also can‚Äôt the company just replicate what you‚Äôre doing too
[4:19:10] revenueprofit: its a good idea but i thought its been done already
[4:19:17] Antiph3d: its brilliant. it puts them towards the front as opposed to playing catch-up
[4:19:18] StorMN1: unfortunately a lot of people are still saving for houses and dont want to spend money on a computer
[4:19:20] salzye_: its technically selling butcoin
[4:19:24] allukka1: what does having 3 butcoin on a computer do?
[4:19:24] kayneechan: This idea is gonna come in clutch when the PD is gonna start seizing houses.
[4:19:24] gRi_in: well thats true, but now people have already invested in all that stuff?
[4:19:24] kyle8594: It's genius bro zaitoh10
[4:19:24] khadka9860: i bet u besties will be the one buying mining racks
[4:19:26] isaiahcpf: You can work together with yuno that's exactly what he's doing
[4:19:31] chibi10011: @thumphah  they are pre occupied with drama
[4:19:33] wigren98: if all the groups is starting to mine with 6+ racks they wont need it tho
[4:19:34] mrperson1234: LUL
[4:19:35] norebONyx: fix your sleep schedule pls au is too late
[4:19:38] brikbeans: Convenience is op
[4:19:38] luckerooni: ive heard people talk about this idea but not actually commit to it
[4:19:39] Blueypug: @allukka1 youre able to buy smokecrack so you can send coins
[4:19:45] james3149: someone will yoink LUL
[4:19:48] mrperson1234: People been trying to do this idea for a while but no one wanted to spend that much
[4:19:49] revenueprofit: okie

[4:20:01] LDUBHUB: are we ever going to gamble ?
[4:20:02] wigren98: if all the big groups already has 6+ racks etc they wont need it
[4:20:03] revenueprofit: @dbnite let him find out in rp PepeLa
[4:20:04] LJkAze: @thumphah Where they gonna get mats lol
[4:20:12] talund: and nobody will beat yuno connection. dude have the entire city on his friend list

[4:20:16] Nisl: smart
[4:20:16] kayneechan: @ljkaze lang
[4:20:18] salzye_: bro going to collect all the ip address
[4:20:22] jaxtapose: why not just send butcoin packaged with whatever parts they want tho?
[4:20:23] thumphah: I think you should find customers first before going all in
[4:20:24] mrperson1234: The Company has tried this for like 2 weeks but never got a sale because no one wants to spent 25k on an hdd
[4:20:24] Noxrif: omieFancy
[4:20:27] isitreallynecessary: Great idea to be sure
[4:20:37] isaiahcpf: How much are you planning to charge, that's pretty expensive?
[4:20:41] Akizakiz: @DangersClose most big group not the little guy
[4:20:44] revenueprofit: chat hes talking about NEW people trying to get into it
[4:20:49] james3149: @dangersclose there will always be new apps coming soon
[4:20:51] wigren98: yes but if most ppl have racks filled up they wont need a HDD
[4:20:51] revenueprofit: like smaller groups
[4:20:57] il_capitano91: I can't wait until you can hack other peoples butcoin KEKW
[4:21:03] thumphah: test the market and only start making after securing the deal
[4:21:06] ak47_dont: I got one irl
[4:21:07] oryeezy: 5Head
[4:21:08] Jee_Himself: an hdd with smokecrack at like 10k would sell very well imo
[4:21:10] luckerooni: the other cool thing is you end up doing geeksquad rp with people as you figure out their needs and figure out the best solution for them like you did in the apt
[4:21:18] revenueprofit: DATA COLLECTION 5Head

[4:21:30] Moby1kanobee: what if they already wne thru trouble of PC and just want a prelaoded HDD with like 15 BUTC? so they can just buy apps
[4:21:31] mrperson1234: @il_capitano91 Assume people will have an offline HDD that is only put in to add buttcoin into then the HDD is removed and put back into storage
[4:21:34] isaiahcpf: That would be great once the robberies come out on computers, everyone's gonna want them.
