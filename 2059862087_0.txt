[2:43:27] Roro_____: that looks like stolen car chop part LUL
[2:43:39] UrD3MONz: that 1
[2:43:50] Levitax: look out of place
[2:43:51] Crazyman114: maybe you need high quality tables?
[2:43:52] guzeriz: all wood just does not match LUL
[2:43:53] OhkE: that one isnt bad
[2:43:53] lubyou3000: I thought you originally had a higher quality table chosen for this roo,?
[2:43:59] M0hkofantti: Hunting mught be worth it now when hides are used in rugs
[2:43:59] OhkE: yea color is bad
[2:44:00] coolxb3ans: that doesnt match
[2:44:03] kriptom10: the wooden table looks more cozy
[2:44:06] drokoh: the glass is definitely better
[2:44:08] Taxike: i think tables are normal size, just couch is so huge ;D

[2:44:20] mishegas: a carpet would really tie the room togeather
[2:44:23] Levitax: looks a bit too "old" with the legs that it has
[2:44:28] guzeriz: that one glass is Pog
[2:44:36] guzeriz: this one is Pog
[2:44:38] iHarsh29: maybe exchange for high quality
[2:44:40] qwarie: 2 the same, can you just overlap them?
[2:44:44] crookz_n_castlez: That's nice
[2:44:53] guzeriz: YEP this is the best
[2:44:57] mooneriss: can't you move the tv and couch over a big so its more central to the room and then the table won't seem so squashed into the space?
[2:44:58] realJokoWidodo: AINTNOWAY
[2:45:03] julleka_: Yep
[2:45:04] StreamElements: YEP COCK
[2:45:07] UrD3MONz: yea thats nice
[2:45:09] guzeriz: small is good its just a coffe table @Acie
[2:45:13] cfbonde: with a rug then its so perfect
[2:45:15] 42arc: 1 is enough, it's a table, who cares
[2:45:15] BabyNeek: 1 is ok 2 might be hard to walk around
[2:45:18] ToTheSameHeights: yeah it’s ok if it’s a little small
[2:45:19] deviusdark: MONKA
[2:45:22] STONASESS: will all go together with  rug
[2:45:23] arkxpert: that looks a bit…..
[2:45:23] Roro_____: glas way too see thru, loooks invisible
[2:45:26] BoJackJohnsson: You have to think about hitbox to. It might look a bit sily but with hitbox you need to be able to walk around
[2:45:32] Genisyys_: wont be enough space to walk to the room then no?
[2:45:34] UrD3MONz: Yep
[2:45:34] StreamElements: YEP COCK

[2:45:57] Roro_____: thats a car part
[2:46:02] Shivie78: That black one fits the style the best imo
[2:46:04] khlcsl: this is better
[2:46:14] DragonSage2008: Could do 4 of the small ones. Though it would be nicer if the legs on it where darker.
[2:46:17] guzeriz: this one is just stupid no leg room from other side omE
[2:46:22] genn1_: A normal couch with 3 chairs around the table would look good tbh That way table won't be too small and will be proportionate with the space of that room
[2:46:25] cfbonde: People need space to walk also the smaller are perfect
[2:46:27] iHarsh29: put a vase on that
[2:46:28] fizzibility: do 2 square ones
[2:46:30] Mr_Stevex: i like the rounded one
[2:46:33] OhkE: one of the high quality square ones was big
[2:46:35] uwucandiice: can put two rectangles side by side

[2:46:48] improvedimpulse: Two rectangles then
[2:46:48] ToTheSameHeights: rectangle good enough
[2:46:50] Hillbilly_Hxck: overlap to the size you want
[2:46:53] Q_Erisa: i think its the sofa, its just too big. maybe try a different sofa?
[2:46:54] Mr_Stevex: double the rounded one?
[2:46:54] stopandrun: two rectangle ones
[2:46:59] DragonSage2008: do 2 of the rectangle ones to make it square.
[2:47:02] khlcsl: you could double this one, or just use any % of this curved one on the second one
[2:47:04] N3mEe: buy one more and put them together
[2:47:06] Crazyman114: GUYS IT'S PERFECT
[2:47:06] loekup: I would take the first one since it comes with props on it, and switch it out later for the high qual one
[2:47:06] qwarie: Overlap them girlie
[2:47:16] improvedimpulse: Four squares
[2:47:16] drokoh: legs on that are hideous
[2:47:19] Levitax: i feel like, if that would be my living room, that TV to couch distance is way to high. personally
[2:47:19] uwucandiice: getting told no by streamelements LUL
[2:47:20] Mr_Stevex: other onr?

[2:48:20] isp1337: That's what she said :(
[2:48:20] STONASESS: will all come together with a rug and some art and plants
[2:48:29] stopandrun: yea

[2:49:37] xZRAFx: u can make it closer to the bottom
[2:49:39] stopandrun: looks good
[2:49:40] isp1337: the TV side doesn't really need a table
