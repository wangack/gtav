[0:34:03] brjnoqo3kd: Though Rockstar has yet to announce the release date for GTA 6, let alone its pricing, we can assume GTA 6 will most likely cost $70—if not higher—at launch. The reason we could see GTA 6 costing more than $70 at launch is because fans have been waiting for the next GTA entry since 2013. FROM GOOGLE

[0:58:16] happyheals: happyheals subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[0:58:17] joshcheckers: lil bro "why would it matter"
[0:58:17] Decoyduck: so u keep it on ur wearing it down

[0:58:20] Galactic_Tactics: cata is full of dogshit zones and dungeons no one remembers
[0:58:21] massivewow: because you have like 9,000,000 background processes running if you leave it on

[0:58:27] Kamreizal: how about you overclock my cock
[0:58:30] BingoTingler: if your computer stays idle for 8-12 hours then it's better to turn it off regularly.
[0:58:33] stormshear: alien
[0:58:34] fossland: @Kamreizal HUH
[0:58:36] da_head: Because it takes 10 seconds for your p c to turn on these days with an s s d. No excuse t b h. This isnt 20 years ago with hard drives that took 10 years to boot

[0:59:22] RushTurok: You gotta keep your pc running at operating temp so the internals stay lubricated
[0:59:23] BingoTingler: no - not compared to sitting idle and running for 8+ hours
[0:59:25] fossland: never turn the pc on, thanks

[3:42:45] awhfy: is this graycen guy actually fr ?
[3:42:46] ErobbIsWhite: @Graycen I have a slight headache today can you please speak in a deeper voice today? FeelsWeirdMan
[3:42:48] Thomsan04: Kermit: graycen. Listen. We all know you're a known fence sitter. I get that you don't want to choose a side because you lack a spinal cord and therefore can't stand up for anything. But how about manning up for once in your life and putting them both in their place and choosing the gang
[3:42:48] HolySpiritActiv8: @Spoon2240 can't ban mods
[3:43:06] DecentlyGaming: that was almost as annoying as you
[3:43:18] Sun_Rah: baseg

[3:43:49] Its_Parker_Btw: oof
[3:43:51] Thomsan04: I just wanna stir the pot xdd
[3:43:51] crazyjoker961: there was nothing that cam did wrong really, pop is a child really not someone to be in a gang
[3:43:53] Trodenskjold: You really put Cam in his place when you were gagging on his cock buddy
[3:44:03] meathead_48: SLORPGLORPIN cam hes so emotional, youre so right
[3:44:04] IIIIllIlll: bruh that shit doesnt even sound like Kermit KEKW wtf
[3:44:12] Its_Parker_Btw: you better stick up for his emotional ass
[3:44:20] echoMOTN: Cam is the alpha
[3:44:29] MXLXMXR: popsocket carries cam squad

[3:45:51] Kotodama1: wait hes in the hospital again LMAOOOOOOOOOO
[3:45:58] Trodenskjold: Hospital streamer
[3:45:58] crucialhead: Cam Squad is virtually dead

[3:46:05] IIIIllIlll: classic
[3:46:11] pod67: @Thomsan04 fuck the group is boring without pop tho
[3:46:14] Slyzer: om
[3:46:14] Tony2362: Why did you buy a house when you live at the hospital?
[3:46:17] crazyjoker961: cam should go because he is a clean guy he should be kicked, and pop is emotional and he should be out of gang too
[3:46:35] Trodenskjold: Graycen spends more time at the hospital than the doctors
[3:46:51] Kotodama1: damn he called you gross and you let it slide ?
[3:46:56] Thomsan04: @pod67 content will pick up once gary gets a gun and can mug XQC

[3:47:26] smky187: I'm actually proud of Stuart telling him to fuk off and walking away from it all
[3:47:40] not_grieves: True and real
[3:48:01] not_grieves: And Gary is a fucking jackass don't forget
[3:48:06] Trodenskjold: When you got shot? Which time
[3:48:19] IIIIllIlll: ROACH OUT
[3:48:22] Thomsan04: You ideally want at least 1 person in the gang without a record
[3:48:23] crucialhead: I roll with 12 gangs
[3:48:46] IIIIllIlll: @crucialhead sounds exhausting lol
[3:49:01] masteroogwayx21: its all gary's fault
[3:49:11] SavingGrace: get archie and red back in at this point
[3:49:22] smky187: I seen what was said Stuart hasn't twisted anything
[3:49:53] smky187: Yal have a great night with the cam sukers.. ✌️✌️
[3:49:54] Trodenskjold: NoPixel is gonna be so much better when Graycen leaves
[3:50:15] MXLXMXR: cam is gonna miss that slorping in 5 days
[3:50:17] crazyjoker961: pop like to do stupid stuff not a person who would be in a gang, cam is clean and should do gang stuff if he want to stay
[3:50:20] Thomsan04: Pop definitely telling the story out of context to get people on his side
[3:51:05] Trodenskjold: Gary just follows the one with the biggest cock SLORPGLORPIN
[3:51:37] Thomsan04: @graycen who has the smallest wang in the gang
[3:51:44] crazyjoker961: exactly he is really sensitive  which is bad to have in gang
[3:51:57] AshnDoom: you guys are confused this is all graycens fault

[3:52:51] crucialhead: @erobbiswhite om
[3:52:59] SavingGrace: gary got lenny banned
[3:53:06] Trodenskjold: Dont worry. Cam will just buy a new with the money Gary is making him
[3:53:11] BerkTheLUL: he likes to play the victim. kinda yikes
[3:53:25] Nitewinds: yeah it's pretty cringe
[3:53:41] masteroogwayx21: pop only fuck with you , he dont hangout with other members
[3:53:42] HolySpiritActiv8: yet you're going on about it for hours
[3:53:42] Trodenskjold: Are you calling Popsocket your highschool sweetheart?
[3:53:42] Nitewinds: wants to be begged to come back by cam or some shit
[3:53:48] not_grieves: you never had a relationship in high school how would u know
[3:53:55] crazyjoker961: yeah exactly lol he is emotional and thinks he is in school
[3:54:09] TiggerKnowsBest: talking to us like we had in friends in high school FeelsBadMan
[3:54:14] crucialhead: Yet you betrayed him
[3:54:18] crazyjoker961: i love him but he is not good fit for gang
[3:54:24] XeohHD: lol
[3:54:31] Nitewinds: i'm just the kind of person who if i go to sleep mad about something i'll be over it when i wake up so i don't get it really
[3:54:38] Bluegent: what do you mean? he was married to wow
[3:54:44] Kotodama1: Everyone leaving for phase 2 anyway. He need a new gang. It works.
[3:54:44] crazyjoker961: cam clean guy should go
[3:54:47] Sun_Rah: ACTINUP he think he can leave just like that, time to blood him out
[3:54:55] crazyjoker961: v pushing to get rep 100%
[3:55:03] Nitewinds: yeeeah
[3:55:24] Trodenskjold: Lets be real. All this is really about Popsocket being mad that Gary is sucking off Cam way more than he is sucking off Pop
[3:55:25] Slyzer: Adam: You guys need Adam Sandler.
[3:55:45] bamboniiii: cause you actually didnt
[3:55:49] MXLXMXR: cam do something about it SLORPGLORPIN
[3:55:50] Nitewinds: to be completely serious and not troll for a moment, you're generally very easy going and cheerful and i don't see you get upset about much of anything so yeah
[3:55:52] Thomsan04: "Don't listen to Gary's side. He wasn't paying attention to any of it"
[3:55:55] IIIIllIlll: bro yall a bunch of dude with no leader.... everyone wants to be top dog, now shit getting stirred between yall.   IMO, of course. they each just wanna have last word.
[3:55:59] Tony2362: he probably left because he every one he normally rp's with is gone once sod is out
[3:56:05] Kotodama1: i was defending him. repeatedly called him emotional om
[3:56:07] Trodenskjold: Cam please defend me SLORPGLORPIN
[3:56:15] Nitewinds: that's fine, it's okay to have your own moral code and stick by it
[3:56:39] crucialhead: Watch the VOD
[3:56:43] bamboniiii: he phrased it differently
[3:56:44] Sun_Rah: om
[3:56:46] bamboniiii: you should watch your vod
[3:56:50] Trodenskjold: Cam did say that his totempole is in you
[3:56:56] Thomsan04: True. He said there was a hierarchy of who deserves to get paid back first.
[3:56:57] Sun_Rah: om 󠀀
[3:56:59] Nitewinds: popsocket heard what he wanted to hear.

[3:58:08] Daderlus: gary pls stop streaming i cant support this
[3:58:10] Daredevil_rx: he did say the thing about the totem pole, he literally replayed that part of his stream
[3:58:19] playdanksouls: W Gary

[4:57:54] Thomsan04: @epickkiller34_ so taking the criticism of the other people involved, admitting he had his own shortcomings, and being mature enough to take a step back isn't levelheaded?

[5:08:21] Thomsan04: @epickkiller34_ it isn't boyscout RP. They made a gang and wanted to make money. If pop was already asking fancy for cash 2-3 times, and then asks if he can take money from the group, why give it to him? He obviously can't make as fast a return as he was saying he would. You don't gotta cater to everyone's feelings just because one person wants one thing. Especially if a majority says no.

[5:09:19] Neonbonkers: @Thomsan04 Popsocket's whole ordeal of why he's upset is because someone was gatekeeping him after he felt like he put in a massive amount of effort and wanted just a little bit in return.

[5:10:36] DuckSmoke_: Regardless of if Pop should or should not have got the money, they were both being immature and emotional, but the main thing was that Cam was being disrespectful and dismissive of Pop, who in reality has more seniority in the group.

[7:05:20] Marks0nn: very emotional decision and if that’s the case then the house should’ve been out in fancy’s name if he wasn’t going to be long term
[7:05:34] DuckSmoke_: @relmo Cam is a sad boy now and "stepping back" from the gang stuff.

[7:06:47] Silvergorillia: that’s what they said this phase
[7:06:58] damroyalty: to be fair popsocket was quiet unless trying to make gary & cam see his perspective, other than that i really think cam was the only emotional one. pop just removed himself from the toxicity
