[0:34:37] Sazel2010: over a 5 year waiting list for adhd in the Uk & it‚Äôs hard to get on it, I‚Äôve just turned 50 and can‚Äôt get my doctor to listen
[0:34:50] DaniTheDeer: My doc prescribed me with too high if a dose of ADHD meds and they messed me up bad
[0:34:52] TRgaming1985: TER
[0:34:55] TRgaming1985: yer
[0:34:56] PimicTV: Ritalin is worse than Adderal I think
[0:34:57] FrozenReeses: isn't ritalin worse?
[0:34:58] oilbeefhooked: im in the uk and im on Concerta XL for adhd
[0:35:14] Stonehearted: Waiting paralysis?
[0:35:25] Briankerg: You don't have to be on medication but sometimes it's for the best trust me I went years without treating it and then I seen a doctor and it changed my life.
[0:35:29] oilbeefhooked: it's slow release over approx 12hrs
[0:35:29] Polaflex: I remember because It's the only time I leave the house Kappa
[0:35:30] Stonehearted: If I have an appt, I can't do anything
[0:35:31] Emstrogen: The way to treat ADHD is often.. taking a pill the same time every day. I find that hilarious.
[0:35:33] tangobish: i have reminders for everything on my phone now idk how i survived before
[0:35:36] PimicTV: That just sounds like a poor memory
[0:35:37] oilbeefhooked: helps me massively
[0:35:37] MrAnxii: that‚Äôs because it‚Äôs not at the forefront of your mind probs
[0:35:41] hastyle4: Ritalin is lighter than Adderall.
[0:35:48] MrSym: 100% sort the referral and go with it. Literally no reason not to, it'll only benefit you
[0:36:00] hastyle4: Adderall was too much for me
[0:36:02] tigerific_: you are not alone
[0:36:19] tigerific_: im having that also
[0:36:21] Briankerg: @hastyle4 me to.
[0:36:28] Stonehearted: yeah, don't sit and suffer. Looking back it destroyed my schooling and career
[0:36:34] Sazel2010: my son has been on the waiting list for the test for 3 years so far :(
[0:36:51] justjadewastaken: YEP
[0:36:52] hastyle4: Concerts is just Ritalin that is extended release
[0:36:52] Sazel2010: he‚Äôs in his 30‚Äôs
[0:36:54] justjadewastaken: ADHD be like that
[0:37:08] MrSym: ADHD is common. My daughter is going through diagnosis and as a result, my partner noticed she shared symptoms and got diagnosed too LuL
[0:37:08] MrAnxii: no sleep probs doesn‚Äôt help üòÇ
[0:37:18] PimicTV: Maybe ry some chamomile tea to relax youir mind
[0:37:34] oilbeefhooked: the concerta xl helps me massively, i didnt get diagnosed till my early 20s and it was life changing
[0:37:45] Polaflex: You can probably go private for faster testing right? Although it shouldn't have to be that way
[0:38:15] justjadewastaken: ADHD can come whenever and go whenever my ADHD has gotten better compared to when I was 5 to 10
[0:38:17] JefeRoss: age?
[0:38:30] MrSym: Keep in mind that when you were younger, it was far less common to be diagnosed with ADHD, especially in boys
[0:38:34] MrAnxii: Ellie has ADHD, think it‚Äôs easily diagnosed üëÄ

[6:55:17] MrSym: The voice is great gwiseKEKW
[6:56:14] MrSym: She went in and personally changed her own witness statement on the MDW?
[6:56:46] TruthHurtsSom3T1mes: @mrsym yes, because Baker didn't want to do the report.
[6:56:55] lipscartwister: soon peepoJail
[6:56:55] Ballarur87: @TruthHurtsSom3T1mes Yepp this LUL
[6:57:19] MrSym: That just doesn't look good at all, even if it's completely innocent
[6:58:42] TruthHurtsSom3T1mes: @mrsym why, tho?  Witnesses amend theirs statements all the time.  This isn't a cop changing a report, it's a witness statement being amended.  Baker, should have done the reporting, but she couldn't be bothered.
[6:58:48] TRAYVES: Looks like she was possibly trying to save herself, but I mean oop
[6:59:22] MrSym: @TruthHurtsSom3T1mes But witnesses don't usually have the ability to edit their own statement, they have to go through someone and officially record an update
[6:59:36] TruthHurtsSom3T1mes: @mrsym which is on Baker, no?
[6:59:50] MrSym: Both would be responsible imo
[7:00:01] TruthHurtsSom3T1mes: @mrsym that's fair
[7:00:14] Roobeman: NODDERS
[7:00:27] Adamantly_Adam: she technically could've gone to any other cop I think and say hey, id like to update my statement, no? wouldnt HAVE to be baker?
[7:01:18] MrSym: Yeah she could've gone to anyone really
[7:01:20] Ballarur87: @Adamantly_Adam they would probably just say "take it with the officer who is handling the report (baker)."
[7:01:51] Adamantly_Adam: at that point, thats that cop neglecting their duties.
[7:02:04] OvrGwn: @Adamantly_Adam Shes also the victim of the kidnapping, I believe victims can change their statement at any time before court.
[7:02:47] MrSym: The problem is less that her statement changed, but more how it was done

[7:03:26] MrSym: @justmarcus33 How so?
[7:03:38] ÂèØÊÑõÂèØÊÑõ: create an onx bill of right but it's just the bill of rights with the amendment numbers shuffled around to confuse everyone
[7:04:00] justmarcus33: it would be fruit of the poisonions tree sure... not used in court... but even that you can find collabroating evidence
[7:04:04] feugr76: Stare
[7:04:19] TruthHurtsSom3T1mes: That's kinda glossing over whet they said about her.  It was in public, in uniform, in front of a room full of civilians.

[7:16:21] M_dubU: sodaHmm
[7:16:56] GoofyGermanGirl: that looked really good
[7:19:04] Nejderz: when she say "use it", does she mean as evidence in court or use it as in read through the phone?
[7:19:52] Killeruk0: @Nejderz it means no information gathered can be used in prosecution in any way
[7:21:00] lipscartwister: woods rn residentCD
[7:21:47] Nejderz: @Killeruk0 thats what I thought myself. But I wonder if Candice realize that lightbulb moment herself
[7:22:15] Killeruk0: @Nejderz she is actually very knowledgable i believe.
[7:22:45] lipscartwister: NPCing
[7:23:54] MrSym: Equally, she should know that writing her own report is bad and refused to do it herself
[7:24:18] Killeruk0: several people...
[7:24:37] MrSym: Did she raise any complaints at the time about that?
[7:26:38] Nejderz: Its how you go about it. Subpoena if you have PC that this individual was involved in the kidnapping. Not steal something and claim it as evidence
[7:27:09] MrSym: So many points of error, what a shit show KEKW
[7:27:14] lipscartwister: oop
[7:27:18] MrSym: Not from just Candice
[7:31:09] haista3: didnt want to investigate but i wanted to crack the phone to investigate KEKW
[7:31:20] MrSym: oop
[7:31:24] RevilTheDevil: oop
[7:32:01] HAZEo_0: Shouldn't matter what kind of phone it is
[7:32:08] MrSym: Are 'transfers' afforded the same level of training as brand new cadets?
[7:32:56] InJeopardyy: MrSym candice was technically a brand new cadet iirc
[7:33:11] MrSym: She didn't come in as a transfer?
[7:33:24] InJeopardyy: kept the name but younger version who didnt know any police stuff
[7:33:32] Cryptic_Overload: She came in as a cadet @mrsym
[7:33:46] MrSym: Interesting Hmm
[7:34:23] TRAYVES: wtf
[7:34:35] MrSym: KEKW
[7:39:48] Nejderz: this is the training she actually needs
[7:41:27] zeabird: I would think in real life that there are ways to source who bought the phone through serial numbers and stuff
[7:41:52] Nejderz: Greco needs to type another notice from the beach of Hawaii LUL
[7:41:58] zeabird: so kinda like deliver the phone to someone who can do that without unlocking it or whatever
[7:43:14] MrSym: You can't blame it all on Baker though, as Candice should also know what is right and wrong Shruge
[7:44:06] gaavriel_: she isnt
[7:44:12] justmarcus33: @zeabird not irl pay with cash
[7:44:42] zeabird: @justmarcus33 but did they know that before tho?
[7:44:46] MrSym: Surely even if a superior says "write your own report" or something, you have the agency to know that it's the wrong thing to do
[7:44:47] MrSym: imo
[7:44:50] haista3: arnt they both officers
[7:44:55] RodHawkinson: why‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs face messed up lol

[7:45:26] MrSym: "By accident" is a bit of a lie
[7:45:27] MrSym: KEKW
[7:46:05] DaedrenSC: there is definitely a lot to learn from this no matter the outcome
[7:46:12] Nejderz: time to fake a episode Woods KEKW
[7:46:38] justmarcus33: @zeabird eh for me its a combination between what the laws in the city vs IRL are... if its based on IRL its not even any punishment
[7:47:01] MrSym: IRL laws don't come into it
[7:47:08] MrSym: So not really any benefit to consider it
[7:47:11] Nejderz: optics towards the public? Might need a good gesture or apology of some sort
[7:47:21] bluzkluz: I feel like Harold should just give the entire judgement
[7:47:29] bluzkluz: and whatever is understood stands
[7:47:31] Nejderz: from Candice or PD
[7:47:49] zeabird: I think harold should be the president tbh
[7:48:17] justmarcus33: I would vote for harold\
[7:48:56] tangobish: assuming candice is telling the truth on baker
[7:49:04] zeabird: anyone listen to new MGMT album? Hmm
[7:49:35] MrSym: @tangobish Very true
[7:49:55] kiba592: seems like multiple officers need training
[7:49:56] NomadNorth28: @zeabird noy yet but excited to soon
[7:50:13] TruthHurtsSom3T1mes: Sure she should?  Was she trained on it?  Who's fault is that?
[7:50:27] zeabird: @NomadNorth28 Its more lowkey but its great Okayge
[7:51:05] Ballarur87: he hates her soo much KEKW
[7:51:06] Ballarur87: LUL

[7:51:14] NomadNorth28: @zeabird nice! ive always liked their stuff
[7:51:25] MrSym: He does have a fair point
[7:51:56] InJeopardyy: thats still hearsay from candices POV tho?
[7:51:59] HAZEo_0: Kinda a fair point yea

[7:54:45] TruthHurtsSom3T1mes: How long should she wait to be helped after being kidnapped at gunpoint? FailFish
[7:55:40] Sazel2010: 5-7 days LUL
[7:55:54] kiba592: True
[7:55:54] TruthHurtsSom3T1mes: @sazel2010 apparently
[7:56:17] MrSym: Fire the Sheriff
[7:56:20] MrSym: NODDERS
[7:56:20] Kemli: Classic CID knew about this months ago
[7:56:42] kiba592: Then why is there no announcement what to do Susge
[7:56:44] Kemli: But there is a weird attachment
[7:56:48] MrSym: Burner phones are just another phone at the end of the day
[7:56:57] MrSym: They're not inherently illegal, right?
[7:57:10] Kemli: Perhaps they are
[7:57:22] TruthHurtsSom3T1mes: @mrsym that's an important question, which apparently no one knows, so...
[7:58:18] MrSym: Was Archie not meant to be taking part in the discussion of the outcome?
[7:58:24] MrSym: Or did I mishear at the start
[7:58:38] Sazel2010: at the end of the day she admitted to jail breaking the phone being the victim doesn‚Äôt excuse it, she‚Äôs a cop and should of known it was wrong to take/look in the phone
[7:58:49] ManakinEU: non solo cadet again ? oop
[7:58:51] gaavriel_: @MrSym if it came to a whole command thing about it i think
[7:58:58] MrSym: @gaavriel_ Gotcha
[7:59:03] Cryptic_Overload: @mrsym Lou didn‚Äôt want him to interject, but seems like Doakes wanted Archie involved
[7:59:18] MrSym: NODDERS
[7:59:37] Ballarur87: she did speak to faraday tho LUL
[7:59:47] Kemli: It could mitigate
[7:59:48] SanyaIV: It doesn't excuse, but it mitigates
[7:59:54] TruthHurtsSom3T1mes: how can anyone think Lou ISNT biased?
[7:59:55] Bulfwyne: yea she still did what she did
[8:00:06] MrSym: @TruthHurtsSom3T1mes His points are valid though
[8:00:18] TahKay: look at all this discussion and debate without toxicity. brings a tear to your eye
[8:00:23] kiba592: thats my sherriff
[8:00:39] sparta_fps: ^
[8:00:43] justmarcus33: @TahKay I agree I love it...its drama without drama
[8:00:43] MrSym: But equally, a little bias keeps it spicy

[8:00:46] Kemli: HypeCry
[8:00:50] Kemli: pentaw1
[8:00:54] Sazel2010: loving the RP :)
[8:01:03] TamiyaCowboy: does look like lou is being unbias
[8:01:11] TruthHurtsSom3T1mes: @mrsym but every point is taking a negative against Candice, regardless of the possibility of seeing both sides.
[8:01:27] Nejderz: She will most likely be fired IF the phone owner press charges civilly. Will be very spicy
[8:01:33] forgotten_soldierz: Who is the person
[8:01:35] Kemli: Civil is last
[8:01:53] Kemli: Thats just internal punishment
[8:01:56] MrSym: @TruthHurtsSom3T1mes He's looking at her failings as an officer, and there are MANY of them. I can't really fault him for taking the stance he is
[8:01:59] DominickPerrero: What if the owner of the phone happens to disappear ü§î LUL
[8:02:22] MrSym: @DominickPerrero That'd be hilarious, she just murders him to make it go away
[8:02:25] MrSym: PepeLa
[8:02:26] Nejderz: respect the judicial procedure
[8:02:29] TruthHurtsSom3T1mes: @mrsym True, but he is ONLY looking at her failures.  THAT is a bias, by definition.
[8:02:30] kiba592: you not the court lou
[8:02:32] Sazel2010: LUL
[8:02:33] DominickPerrero: LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL yes

[8:02:50] DominickPerrero: LUL kyleisHYPERS
[8:02:55] Kemli: Or its just being Judge Dredd
[8:03:09] MrSym: @TruthHurtsSom3T1mes I mean, she didn't exactly do anything 'correct' at any point so SHRUGGERS
[8:03:27] DominickPerrero: @ma_scynths maybe that's why she left......
[8:03:35] TruthHurtsSom3T1mes: @mrsym You think Candice has never done anything correct?
[8:03:54] MA_Scynths: @dominickperrero stripSpy
[8:04:03] MrSym: @TruthHurtsSom3T1mes In this situation, it's predominantly failures
[8:04:28] Bulfwyne: ^
[8:04:29] kiba592: Waow
[8:04:33] TruthHurtsSom3T1mes: @mrsym then I would say you are also biased, which of course is your prerogative. SeemsGood

[8:06:35] forgotten_soldierz: @gaavriel_ love you too
[8:06:46] TruthHurtsSom3T1mes: @mrsym You might be right.

[8:09:47] Nejderz: I think so
[8:10:03] Nejderz: Or she will be bored
[8:10:41] justmarcus33: lol oh Candice would be 100% bored with retraining

[8:20:06] Ohiosveryown: my opinion it is what it is
[8:20:09] MrSym: It's not about 'content RP'. Every officer brings something different. This is fantastic RP
[8:20:20] Bulfwyne: @Ohiosveryown ok ... but its wrong lol
[8:20:38] Ohiosveryown: How is it wrong ive seen a few officers that got fired based on violating rights or laws
[8:20:44] TruthHurtsSom3T1mes: This has been good, overall, for the PD
[8:20:54] Flirting_Scholar: although irl if a police officer was kidnapped even off duty all of this would go out of the window, PD would be on the war path
[8:20:59] Bulfwyne: @Ohiosveryown you should watch more than just a few then ... opinions can be wrong so its ok cuppaTea
[8:21:32] MrSym: Alright, keep the topic of conversation strictly about whats happening within RP NODDERS
[8:21:41] Ohiosveryown: its not about watching more streams its about seeing the officers get fired lol. so its facts that some got fired for violating rights or not knowing the law
