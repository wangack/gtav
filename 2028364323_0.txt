Personally, I am sick of people viewing the South and Southern-ers as stupid. I'm tired of turning on the TV and the only characters I see from the South are either white trash or stupid fools. The South is famous for its entrepreneurs who have paved the way into the future. We are not dense. We are not ignorant. And yet we continue to be wrongly perceived as inbred, backward hillbillies
