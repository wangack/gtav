[1:04:52] bonkiloni: NYAI
[1:04:58] acenterforants: There's a good chance it will be a problem. Not sure how Lang feels about dealing with double dipping in 4.0
[1:05:03] Jaagrat01: cousin is lokey as hell, he stayed a civ for all of 3.0
[1:05:06] Joesniff0_0: FirstTimeChadder

[1:05:50] lightstormclaw: @Jaagrat01 hes been a civ since 2.0 till now
[1:05:51] taylor2electricboogaloo: Yeah, it's why Lang wouldn't let someone new be the clean guy. They simply couldn't know what they were asking for
[1:05:51] seasonedwithsalt: Sykk will give people the unlocks for nothing, its very endearing.
[1:05:52] acenterforants: It's only gonna get more difficult as the cop numbers go up too
[1:05:54] manueI_: @Jaagrat01 bro he blooded out and killed 4 vagos in a day, he wasnt a civ OMEGALUL
[1:05:57] Signs89: there has never been a civ mayor
[1:05:57] Beetle: They have a really uhhh insteresting history PepeLa
[1:06:00] NYCharlie212: I think the thing is new people don't realize how much fun stuff are in the city that's all illegal.  So unless you know what it means to be clean it's tough getting a new player to commit to it
[1:06:01] 33kami: no one else can do it except cousin
[1:06:03] simplysavvy793: It’s been pretty funny having Gigi come in and be able to got toe to toe with Tony on a comedy level.
[1:06:09] Beetle: I think Rod and Tony had the most wholesome ocean dump of 3.0
[1:06:15] Heexxto: What's cousin's streaming name?
[1:06:17] DrKarate_: I can see it being interesting but it feels like being full civ is like playing half the game
[1:06:23] slumvillager: healthcare workers need a wage increase
[1:06:24] AleisterPheles: yeah, GTA RP kinda lends itself more toward cops and robbers in the long run
[1:06:25] rnAlsation: There are so few doctors and EMS now too.
[1:06:26] tacostarvedbeast: can you make a big scene if your fired as a doctor?
[1:06:27] imtwopie: upoooigh
[1:06:28] tofuhai: imagine if they had surgeon rep KEKW
[1:06:31] acenterforants: @heexxto her rarely streams I heard
[1:06:31] monarchkin0: I think in your group u have big problem that is not having group name
[1:06:31] NYCharlie212: If you think doctor pay is bad now, you should see what Doctor pay was back in 3.0 lmao
[1:06:31] Jaagrat01: @manueI_ civ as in cleanish record and doesnt wanna go bust banks and shit
[1:06:32] lightstormclaw: KEKW the love or not love ocean dump was the best
[1:06:32] Inox75: is EMS more interesting?
[1:06:33] seuta: mini games to "heal" or "worsen" injuries would be hilarious

[1:06:34] called_me_sona: why not try to be a Cop
[1:06:35] RenTheRock: the hospital is dead now after the pay nerf
[1:06:40] lunorx6: yeah flipping burger paid better
[1:06:41] qvbxx: they say a lot of mechanics are locked for reasons
[1:06:42] bonkiloni: we need a speedy and gigi arc where they go  on a killin spree after they get high on their own supplies just sayin LOL
[1:06:43] numbertwodooky: geegaGalaxy im waiting for a zombie virus arc one day for the doctors
[1:06:45] cakedupdadjeans: Good for spy network
[1:06:50] teenyassassin24: the doctors have always been screwed even in 3.0
[1:06:58] Chimpie360: for now
[1:06:59] Makagish: Man, doctors don't pay their own doctor doctors better?
[1:07:07] TheWitchAtWoolworths: oof
[1:07:15] seasonedwithsalt: @numbertwodooky That would be great rp
[1:07:18] Beetle: some doctors did some semi back alley stuff in 3.0
[1:07:21] spectre007_endplease: Doctors should get blueprints for bandages and stuff when they heal people
[1:07:21] NYCharlie212: They had the Block Doc arc for a bit in 3.0 but it didn't get a ton of dev support
[1:07:25] Beetle: like HOA had Riv as their doctor
[1:07:32] Jaagrat01: maybe in future they might allow "hood" doctors in the future
[1:07:33] clownpubes: CLOWN PUBES!!
[1:07:33] draftysnowman: i'm sure they'll add some incentives to be doctors but not till way after there's none left

[1:08:52] Comrade_Otaku_: @kitsone geegaHi
[1:08:52] Chimpie360: Buddha was talking about revamping the boring jobs etc so maybe something's down the line on the doctor side who knows

[1:09:06] Piperken: The hospital should always be the best choice
[1:09:13] PrushkaB: I feel like the thing with doctor pay is there's no mechanical reason for it to be super high. There's no risk compared to other stuff
[1:09:22] lunorx6: yeah
[1:09:25] rttSKAR: well, you can be cheesy and say you found it on the ground. as in, the person who stole it dropped it at some time

[1:10:33] yahmobethere: can you still be a pocket doctor for a group in the sense of not reporting bullets being taken out?
[1:10:33] Inox75: you can take to drugs or gun off your crew when they are treated, cops wait for the suspect to be heal before searching them

[1:15:15] yahmobethere: @zlblade_ thats a shame cause you get some good story lines out of a "independent" dr doing risky stuff

[1:15:55] Piperken: solidarity for the ppls
[1:16:01] yahmobethere: but at this point in NP4.0, what are you really gonna do with more money as a civ?
[1:16:03] Cebolexx1: exactly and it would be a doctor doing illegal things like irl. dealing with criminals etc.
[1:16:08] PrushkaB: Do you think they'd ever make the job require more intensive "education" to justify higher pay?
[1:16:08] Sivok: People got money and don't care about the upcharge on store food

[1:17:04] GaiGenX: Veterinarian would be good for that.
[1:17:06] Jaagrat01: there needs to be risk involed, like a mini heist foe docs to slowly steal supplies from hospital
[1:17:09] NelleKook: yeah, like grandma

[1:17:10] kingkoolkattz: having a normal job on the server was always fucked

[6:09:48] bruHoran: ooh that makes sense
[6:09:54] DarthRadonis: maybe need two computers with two HQ apps?
[6:09:55] roesslerm: the one with the grinder shouldnt be cleaning the container! he should just open the containers
[6:10:00] hector2597: door isnt locked
[6:10:14] hypnomaze: ya but the containers have the number on them
[6:10:16] HallowedHen: Animal Crossing mechanics....
[6:10:23] seniorbunss: Clap
[6:10:33] suebae: I think everyone should have a grinder and countdown and all open at same time
[6:10:50] DarthRadonis: is storage full?
[6:10:51] yinh101: whats the point of the conatinaer code then?
[6:10:59] ld_lucky: that shit is right by Cypress to...closer to homebase

[6:11:06] Livesies: Any  cliff notes as to what happened since they got the radios?
[6:11:12] slumvillager: yea
[6:11:16] Snootybooty: what if the container code was the one that triggers the cops Suske
[6:11:16] DrKarate_: Yeah it all depends on how much you get from the others
[6:11:17] Gastaftorz: bet the wrong code is empty or something
[6:11:18] xiell: Worth a try, the other ones might be empty
[6:11:19] kin_gdom: Should just get 2, probably the second one is empty
[6:11:25] JessCee7: Extra juice means more grinder maybe
[6:11:29] thrwy: 10 buttcoin per grindr? Snayge
[6:11:31] sauwu920: if u open 6 will the cop get 6 pings
[6:11:33] sakuravalley: 7containers and 7 missions?
[6:11:43] suebae: Maybe the others have a chance of having stuff
[6:11:45] disinterestedGhost: Or you get something like Jewelry?
[6:11:48] jaczzi: we are ahead of some groups woo
[6:11:49] Oshiball: @thrwy KEKW
[6:11:53] cael_camarada: I think opening other ones will just break the grinder
[6:11:53] mou__12: Imagine guards inside 1 containers
[6:11:57] roesslerm: that would be tooo many guns in the city if u could clean 6 containers 7 times a week
[6:11:57] absurdasparagus: maybe its other kinds of things
[6:12:00] snakeeyes_dadbod: Is there one container per contract hence why you get the code
[6:12:02] cael_camarada: Yup
[6:12:09] slumvillager: wondering what the failure consequence is other than getting caught by the cops
[6:12:18] splitpush: there is a limit to the blueprint most likely
[6:12:22] DarthRadonis: LETSGO
[6:12:31] Oshiball: not enough butt Binoculous
[6:12:33] derperles: Copper jackets are for ammo
[6:12:42] stardustSilhouette: @slumvillager  getting caught by the cops is a pretty big consequence tho
[6:12:53] Reishid: Is there robbery rep?
[6:13:25] Jookmaster: was there no ammo in the heist?
[6:13:28] derperles: Omg so many server racks in here and no A/C?! You should be sweating buckets.

[6:15:00] Hades_bz: 5Head
[6:15:01] roesslerm: u could verify this theory
[6:15:08] seniorbunss: what if they cant see that it was robbed LUL
[6:15:09] UwU_SweetSakura_OnO: Artificial inflation xdding
[6:15:09] splitpush: i dont think that would be likely, too many people on the server to limit it like that
[6:15:13] jumpingdonuts: geegaNODDERS that makes sense, tho its gonna be hot with the cops now

[6:15:47] Emeralblade: congrats on server first btw! (Cornwood got giddy when the call came over the radio)
[6:15:47] splitpush: you can ask marty to check his pc to confirm if thats true
[6:15:54] Nanbuw00: @splitpush no everyone can pay to do the contract.
[6:15:56] suebae: So does this mean only 7 crews can buy the gun blueprint then it's unavailable?
