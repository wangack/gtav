[7:33:46] BladedBuzzer: ALOO cazey
[7:33:54] Isen_Mage: you need like 2-4 repairs an hour just to kinda equal one pounder job. Not even the packer
[7:34:08] itspacecowboy: If they added a ticket system for mechanics, that might help.
[7:34:23] triggerpoint007: I'm starting to think mechanic was never meant to be a viable job
[7:34:34] Isen_Mage: AND there's a tonne more setup and cost going into the mechanic stuff than grime will ever have
[7:34:40] PsychoBKilla: o7 Trees
[7:34:41] Nohbob: So that was really great in 3.0 when they did it.
[7:34:42] ben0809: o7

[7:34:46] zippybln2: poggSpin free firewood
[7:34:47] Corvollo: I'd love to have more to do than just sit there when on the mechanic job. I've spent so many hours just sitting on that wall wishing I could fill the time with something other than Guber
[7:34:49] jaylop94: grime is cozy
[7:34:52] Archangelos1: o7 trees
[7:34:56] doccthunder: treeless, friendless, maidenless Sadge
[7:35:01] mugcostanza: kyliebList
[7:35:06] Nohbob: The Ticket system really helped a ton for viability, and also to even out slow/fast time.
[7:35:07] ben0809: oh wow
[7:35:08] Fr0stwav3: Yeah it's stand around for hours waiting for a wave of repairs, to make basically one grime runs worth of work
[7:35:11] neonishere32: your house is now nice and trimmed kyliebBlush
[7:35:15] Vadoctrax: new branches will form
[7:35:25] lagunavex: Lay out the full scope to make mechanic work profitable and keep it running vs Grime/g6 feels like the best way. Mosley runs don't make enough money as a side profit
[7:35:36] Archangelos1: depends on the tree and how old it is its good to trim them from time to time.
[7:35:54] PsychoBKilla: Chatting DEVGANG
[7:35:54] Harcini: I mean if they make part blueprints to be able to turn for cash as receipt system it will help with the trash they are generating and make mechanic work viable
[7:35:56] dume5330: it will be interesting when they try to sell business licenses for a job that doesn't make a lot of money
[7:35:59] ibruticus: Chatting
[7:36:02] Nohbob: The craziest thing to think of Mosley's gets the most interactions with Benny's, people doing Benny's jobs, Car Sales, and Tire pickup for Tow people.
[7:36:02] bwehn: Chatting
[7:36:06] Isen_Mage: I don't think a ticket system is the solution for mechanics. I think a better fix would be adding NPC car repairs to the mosley jobs. To provide a baseline of cars that need repairing and it can set a base labour payment as well
[7:36:08] ben0809: oof
[7:36:10] ben0809: KEKW
[7:36:12] Vadoctrax: KEKW

[7:36:19] Archangelos1: LOL
[7:36:25] Spelliepanda: did he fall asleep for a min
[7:36:26] doccthunder: jamil would not get the good payouts on euro truck sim
[7:36:32] Isen_Mage: let the master mechanics repair NPC cars nodd
[7:36:32] RoyLeeTV: just a though, KC should all get radios like actual truckers LUL
[7:36:45] Sonaro8: if basic repairs worked like bennys does, where you get a ticket and given parts and the crafted parts were for degredation, they could reenable degredation for more than just engine
[7:36:50] Isen_Mage: it provides a consistent income source for the mechanics
[7:36:52] SpectreUK: Yea fixing NPC cars to fill time yea
[7:36:55] bwehn: and it would get rid of materials from the economy NODDERS
[7:37:03] SpectreUK: and they could incorperate towing into that
[7:37:05] Isen_Mage: and it means players can't complain about the repair cost
[7:37:09] Wardiel_: Could do it with rusty parts and only make a little, or your own parts and make bank
[7:37:15] Isen_Mage: because they're competing with the NPC's for the repairs
[7:37:17] FIunkifer: Wouldnt those npc repairs eat parts tho?
[7:37:18] lagunavex: that job would run into the crafting time issue
[7:37:21] Isen_Mage: so have to pay equal or more
[7:37:21] itzsomepenguin: like you make some money if you buy from rusty but make more if you use your own
[7:37:25] SpectreUK: towing could bring the broken cars they get from their job to get fixed at mosleys
[7:37:44] Nohbob: Well Materials are another problem, it's not maintainable with all of the things being tied to crafting.
[7:37:55] RTHIRO: ye combining towing npc jobs with moselys would be sick
[7:38:09] PsychoBKilla: LUL
[7:38:13] Isen_Mage: if the parts are being used at a semi consistent rate that can be adjusted to fit @Nohbob
[7:38:16] ibruticus: KEKW
[7:38:18] Boltaction_Babe: i will die on the hill of less mats per part DESKCHAN
