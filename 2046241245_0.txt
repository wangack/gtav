[3:25:58] mr_deepsense_: Snowball the monopoly champ
[3:25:59] cloeyzoeymg: how do you rack up that much in fines?
[3:26:07] Seetherrr: @Kyle PD isn't supposed to give any time or fines off for people that have overdue fines now to encourage people to pay their fines, that might help a bit.  Doesn't change anything for the people that have massive fines though
[3:26:17] mlangcs: @cloeyzoeymg by shooting people and cops very quick into the server
[3:26:18] Schhwifty: @cloeyzoeymg Do a fuck ton of crime and serve jail time, then don't pay fines
[3:26:22] PurrplePepper: emstroNotes

[3:27:14] notparanoidbut: NODDERS
[3:27:16] JustAtopica: jail time only counts when they are online on the char
[3:27:16] Tr0LLach: shouldn't do that until Prison stuff is added and it isn't just a forced AFK session
[3:27:18] Schhwifty: Pal Gore at over 20k in fines now yeah? That only took about 2 days LUL
[3:27:21] Spikee439: Naw. If you go to jail....the fines should go off the record
[3:27:23] weazel1: @Kyle have a "credit score" and without high enough credit you cant buy cars, guns etc
[3:27:33] yoyomancoolman: I think extra time would hit people hard
[3:27:35] OrangutansLibrary: asset seizure
[3:27:37] DeliriousBeast: I dont see why people wouldn't just do community service and dont pay fines RN
[3:27:37] Papa_Shark: Something to make people scared to do crime
[3:27:37] Seetherrr: @JustAtopica that isn't how it works...
[3:27:37] ziindi: @JustAtopica ignite did that and it was fucking horrible
[3:27:37] PRONE: fines might be too high currently
[3:27:38] KennedyFnPowers: pentawBlock I ain’t never paying my debt on god
[3:27:38] Frakkles: Yes

[3:27:57] AntiFusion: YESS 762 lifestyle
[3:27:57] CannibalSnacks: I mean kinda LUL
[3:27:58] Bulfwyne: yeee which is why JFTV jr felt weird @Kyle cause then he'll take long breaks
[3:27:59] EmLTee: I feel like that's what the mayhem charge is supposed to be for
[3:28:00] Rem753: money has to be in your account to buy actual assets
[3:28:03] badmattress: pal block baby
[3:28:06] Spikee439: like extra time that takes away fines
[3:28:13] YoshiTensho: @PRONE Cant pay the fine? Dont do crime...
[3:28:18] SargeAngel: not when they’re 400 lol
[3:28:20] Slesh5: community service would be cool RP -having a group of ppl cleaning parks and doing shit around town
[3:28:20] mii_irl: there is a law that counters that but i dont remember the name. Chief was close to getting it
[3:28:21] Archaius: the root cause isnt really fixable bc the root cause is jailtime in RP is just not long and cant be long. ppl do crazy shit and are back the next day. unless they get caught for murder or some shit like that
[3:28:27] SKOL__Valhalla: graveyard
[3:28:37] dunn_: Lockpicks are 400$ he wont be able to afford that after Hat Carl gets him
[3:28:39] mrmoon_step_son: What crime is it even worth doing @yoshitensho
[3:28:40] Livelethal: Could do like drivers license suspensions or something for unpaid fines. RL traffic stuff will do that
[3:28:48] koni05: Or does BHunting better off later on the server timeline
[3:28:51] Livelethal: Kinda small but something
[3:28:52] Seetherrr: @YoshiTensho might be good in theory but doesn't make for a fun server if no one wants to do crime because the risk reward is terrible
[3:29:00] Herman_Miller_1114: are the pay phones marked on the map?
[3:29:01] Zac_NZ: they need to lower fines or increase money availability
[3:29:10] mlangcs: @Zac_NZ the fines have been lowered 80% already
[3:29:11] MrTraceer: Will businesses be taxed?
[3:29:15] QSmirkz: do you have to return the rental?
[3:29:18] mrmoon_step_son: @seetherrr exactly
[3:29:24] Zac_NZ: @mlangcs when did they do that?
[3:29:28] Tooots: Whats the Mayhem law/charge? Is it serial violent felonies or something?
[3:29:34] badmattress: here we go
[3:29:36] mlangcs: @Zac_NZ like 1st 10 days into the server occams lowered 80% of all fines
[3:29:39] ChasRover: @bootyslayer23 if he doesn't he'll have to chase himself down
[3:29:46] EmLTee: Honestly the best way to generate money is by giving crims more money, as they will spend it the most. But obviously you don't want to just flood the economy
[3:29:48] SKOL__Valhalla: xD
[3:29:49] Zac_NZ: @mlangcs ahhk

[3:58:05] Ramsis_Lion: yeah have to have someone watch them do it
[3:58:07] Tooots: Bounty hunter SOPs NODDERS
[3:58:10] zigzagg88: U should collect it
[3:58:11] Newezy: tracker
[3:58:11] bumpa3: Then you hunt them down and fuck them with jail time
[3:58:11] BoomerJungle: yeah a tracker like an ankle monitor would be interesting lol
[3:58:12] TonkaTush: Tags. Ankle tags @Kyle
[3:58:14] badmattress: the signatures just like real life
[3:58:16] UnNotStoppable: @kyle is Hat a Ravens fan?
[3:58:18] blackinvador: I'd imagine those people wouldn't stay around the server for long
[3:58:18] Livelethal: I think there needs to be a penalty, but just not sure debt is the way
[3:58:25] Shaggymatt: If I was that judge, I would have the cops raid his apartment and look for money after that comment LUL
[3:58:26] middy_92: debt that they work off?
[3:58:27] feenx__sama: Is the server against debt?

[3:58:30] Apostate911: @ScaryJerry94 NODDERS The pre-binge is important
[3:58:31] AntiFusion: Hat Bounty Agency soon
[3:58:31] 50_tiger: State should be paying Hat for the snag
[3:58:33] Guy__Montag: can u even work off fines irl? i think u still owe it
[3:58:35] Y0Frodo: maybe they go into debt but can still buy food and gas, increasing their debt of course, but they cant buy anything else
[3:58:36] sharkbawlzzz: Double backflip into debt
[3:58:37] zigzagg88: Need to fake death and collect the money on your head
[3:58:38] endelicato24: I mean the government would have to get the community service script to where they have to do it
[3:58:40] 11km11: Do you really need the meta MDW though? I like the investigating RP so far.
[3:58:41] Timmo001: if they go against the order they should just end up in debt or just never have a paycheck
[3:58:43] rayski56: this is phenomenal rp
[3:58:48] Slesh5: yes ankle bracelets so they can't run from community service
[3:58:50] TonkaTush: Ankle tags would be great for rp
[3:58:53] Newt921: Could you set up an actual garnish system. Like take 25% of wages toward fines?

[3:59:31] emi_the_friendly_potato: PTSD
[3:59:32] blackinvador: @11km11 well in real life people exist in the world at all times but in the server people can be logged off so the meta MDW just lets people know if they're logged in to know if they can interact with them
[3:59:33] HilariousNefarious: HAHAHA
[3:59:39] Axiom462: @Newt921 if we go the garnish route, i'd put a tax that went towards buying things as well

[4:05:25] bumpa3: 30 mins in jail for every 1k they own
[4:05:28] mrmoon_step_son: Because the only crim stuff you can do right now is Rob car and you'll always get caught because cops don't got anything else to do
[4:05:28] sal91q: kyleisNotes
[4:05:32] Archaius: its rough but honestly getting 30k+ in fines doesnt happen over night. he worked a lot to get into that shit it shouldnt be easy to get out of it

[4:05:38] dirty_10_jusclowning: I don't even bother being a crim yet tbh

[4:09:27] RyuShinden: @uphillzombie363 I was referring to only breakin in cars is the only crime in the city. Yes, there are currently no "big time" crimes right now, but there are other crimnes in the city, just petty crimes that is disproportional to the money you get from criming.
