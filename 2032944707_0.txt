[0:34:47] Fossabot: In role-playing games, metagaming is an "out of character" action where a player's character makes use of knowledge that the player is aware of but that the character is not meant to be aware of. Giving Moon information on what's happening in another stream facilitates metagaming and ruins the experience for everyone.

[5:08:27] chizilla_tv: It literally says seed on the app
[5:08:28] CaptenArc: plus rep
[5:08:28] osalittle: Maybe the car keys lead to a car that haas more
[5:08:28] SUPERSCHMINN: It asked you for a quantity

[5:08:44] Zedisalive: Todd did say the jobs aren't worth it yet
[5:08:44] xXlSHIFTYlXx: 1 seed could turn to 10 seeds
[5:08:44] Hafgren: Isn't that what it said?
[5:08:46] Paneras1999: is it building rep?
[5:08:47] soundOrbit: you typed in one, what if you typed more?
[5:08:53] tokyoghost_rs: is the icon still on the map?
[5:08:54] Cinalipples: Car job
[5:08:54] Talis_9: The icon is still there

[5:09:09] jaksmillie: jaksmillie subscribed at Tier 1. 
[5:09:10] rowdy_dog1: oof you did put 1 lol
[5:09:10] Seetherrr: it would have charged him 10 ruby per idk why people are saying he could have gotten more seed for the same price
[5:09:10] BrokeMFClub: Check GPS
[5:09:11] ShadowParadigm: People said it's a rip off for the cheaper stuff so far
[5:09:11] 6rey6kie6: Are those papers and keys a part of it too?
[5:09:12] stackedbrick: that can’t be it
[5:09:15] Ozzelot: symbol is still on the map

[5:09:21] ToastedRubber: seed with keys??
[5:09:21] notburry: Ide look around more
[5:09:22] UnleadedGames: I still think it's there
[5:09:23] tokyoghost_rs: check map
[5:09:25] Gwnquinten: moon maybe check on the map maybe there is other symbols like that spread out?
[5:09:29] mrmoon_step_son: I don't think you did it right
[5:09:30] Dead_Honcho: how many rubys he got now? did it take 10?
[5:09:31] ED_2o9_: icon still there...
[5:09:31] Thaang: moonFail

[5:10:29] General_Terrain: uwuLAUGH
[5:10:30] Wrimbles: start your own farm (of one plant)
[5:10:30] BrokeMFClub: Zoom in on it on the map
[5:10:30] CodeThirteen: Quantity: 1
[5:10:36] Carolinafan17: 1 order..
[5:10:38] Ozzelot: shouldn't the symbol disappear?
[5:10:39] Reverend_Phil: Can you pull in the garage and then pop the trunk?
[5:10:40] tokyoghost_rs: yeah it seems low af
[5:10:41] ak_franks: Maybe its a magic seed, some jack n a giant beanstalk shit
[5:10:41] B_dubz95: did it take 10 rubys?
[5:10:41] Thaang: are there commonly car keys in dumpsters?
[5:10:43] osalittle: Maybe it leads to a drop odd car and the registraton is so its not a stolen car
[5:10:44] Talis_9: 1 order makes more sense
[5:10:47] SpaceMarauderr: is that aleks?
[5:10:49] dr_b00ty: 1 weed please
[5:10:53] WarLyric: I don't think you got it
[5:10:56] iPissOatmeal: for sure look around more 1 seed is wild
[5:10:58] xtheoneandmany: did you spend the 10 rubies ?
[5:10:59] rowdy_dog1: if you picked it up you'd think the marker would be removed
[5:10:59] Wool_story: Buuut..maybe not because you get seeds grinding for the crypto too- Ye Goldie said it
[5:11:00] allthemarbles77: go back
[5:11:05] Seetherrr: is it the exact same description on the weed seed as the others?
[5:11:06] Cinalipples: 10 rubies for 1 seed is insane
[5:11:08] tokyoghost_rs: I'd check more thoroughly
[5:11:09] Fictshn: that said common seed not a weed seed
[5:11:09] syphalisdude: you should have written 100 and seen what happened as you wouldn't have enough Ruby for it anyway?
[5:11:15] BrokeMFClub: Theres a red box next to that thing on the map isnt there?
[5:11:31] WarLyric: What's on the roof
[5:11:37] rowdy_dog1: roof?
[5:11:40] wee_o7: It said milk blvd. Was that where that pick up is
[5:11:45] scavengerquack32: maybe the keys go to a car stash, it's a stretch..
[5:11:54] ToastedRubber: ^^^^^^
[5:11:54] 420CREAM: in the truck?
[5:12:00] Carolinafan17: @syphalisdude no.. its asking how many orders you want.. so he put in one order of weed seeds
[5:12:01] Fictshn: do the keys work for the car
[5:12:16] YazMp4: do it again and youll know for sure
[5:12:16] Wrimbles: yeah its gotta be one seed
[5:12:16] 2unami: Do it again
[5:12:17] Carolinafan17: @syphalisdude if he put 2, it wouldve charged him 20 crypto
[5:12:20] forgotten_soldierz: Maybe the car
[5:12:20] dr_b00ty: check the roof for the care package
[5:12:22] notburry: Key for car
[5:12:25] B_dubz95: try to do quanity 5
[5:12:25] Talis_9: Try it again and see if there's another seed
[5:12:26] BrokeMFClub: What are them stacked boxes?
[5:12:27] tokyoghost_rs: back doors?
[5:12:28] WarLyric: Teams over priced and then the icon not disappearing ...
[5:12:28] Conorwayne: it’s strange that the icon hasn’t gone though
[5:12:32] soundOrbit: try it again but maybe try typing in 2?
[5:12:35] WarLyric: Seems
[5:12:38] soundOrbit: moonDOTDOTDOT
[5:12:40] Thaang: maybe Finley knows
[5:12:41] Seetherrr: @soundOrbit would just waste 20 ruby
[5:12:43] syphalisdude: @Carolinafan17 one weed seed seems totally shit though surely?
[5:12:51] Wool_story: Agreed @Carolinafan17
[5:12:53] Hento: no one else can probably see it anyway
[5:12:55] Carolinafan17: @syphalisdude yeah, i dont think he's found it yet
[5:12:56] Talis_9: See if you can duplicate the process
[5:13:03] ToastedRubber: I don't think so either
[5:13:04] Cinalipples: Car job?
[5:13:09] BrokeMFClub: Open map and zoom all the way in and see if it shows anything?
[5:13:10] BCbuddahSMOKE: How do we know
[5:13:11] Seetherrr: Is the description on thee seed any different from normal seeds ?
[5:13:13] Hento: I mean if you NEEDED a seed I dont see a problem
[5:13:15] Fictshn: keys in the dumpster . do they work on the car around the corner ?
[5:13:16] Geowind: waste all our rubies mitchiLul
[5:13:17] CaptenArc: depends on how much rep it also gives
[5:13:21] rowdy_dog1: 100 By 10 seeds
[5:13:21] theLULnessMonster: LUL
[5:13:22] ManSludge: 10 bricks
[5:13:24] B_dubz95: but try 2 to see if it cost 20 and gives you 2
[5:13:27] Thaang: map zoom might help for real
[5:13:27] UnleadedGames: It'd take like 1000 rupies to get enough seeds for that though
[5:13:27] viva_la_ham: DinoDance moonKUMITE TwitchConHYPE
[5:13:28] JeebieBeebies: might need to plant the seed to get rid of the marker
[5:13:29] Hento: saves from grinding out cars, and who knows maybe you cant randomly find them soon
[5:13:32] BloodySinDrome: moonSURELY
[5:13:34] Ozzelot: hope Todd knows someone to confirm it
[5:13:37] Overcastdays: Why would the mark still be there?
[5:13:39] ShadowParadigm: The car job was like 180$ someone said
[5:13:43] theLULnessMonster: jnbDance moonDANCE2
[5:13:45] Doogli: buy another one fuck it
[5:13:45] ToastedRubber: You get rep for buying the seeds
[5:13:45] daveybama: we need Emmett he was the brains
[5:13:50] Cinalipples: Don't we have enough for another job?
[5:13:50] Seetherrr: @MrMoonsHouse Does the weed seed have the same description as the seeds you find in cars?
[5:13:51] Wool_story: It makes..sense right because you dig for seeds in cars, get cypto as a bonus..and as extra bonus can use crypto to get more seeds
[5:13:52] Bizzelz: unless they changed it
[5:13:53] soundOrbit: @seetherrr so if he typed in 2 would it cost 20 rubies?
[5:13:54] Wool_story: since they are rare..?
[5:13:56] jaktreequitter: hmm
[5:13:59] sammyk3000: buying weed seeds just saves time looking
[5:14:00] Seetherrr: @soundOrbit yeah
[5:14:06] Cinalipples: @daveybama coolioLUL
[5:14:10] ToastedRubber: You get REP for buying the seeds.
[5:14:11] B_dubz95: it said completed though right
[5:14:12] viva_la_ham: didnt u check 100 caRS WITH  no seeds
[5:14:12] osalittle: I saw another red dot on the map
[5:14:14] soundOrbit: @seetherrr ok gotcha
[5:14:15] Wrimbles: good news, the app works
[5:14:18] Ammugammu: Where is Milk Boulevard
[5:14:18] forgotten_soldierz: Feel the car and the keys are meant for something
[5:14:23] B_dubz95: whaat is MLK BLVD?
[5:14:23] Reverend_Phil: Pull in the garage, pop the trunk
[5:14:25] touchnova: red building south? 🤷‍♂️
[5:14:31] wee_o7: Look on milk blvd
[5:14:32] Wool_story: I wonder if something is missing, the icon still on the map is messing with my brain LUL
[5:14:35] Seetherrr: Ahh lame, i thought it might have been a special seed
[5:14:40] Cinalipples: There was keys there
[5:14:41] Grendelvult: You passed a car
[5:14:41] osalittle: Check your map
[5:14:46] Fictshn: grab the keys in the dumpster and try them on the car around the corner
[5:14:47] Talis_9: Doesn't make sense
[5:14:48] rowdy_dog1: the marker is following you
[5:14:50] theLULnessMonster: He out
[5:14:54] limpymcforskin: they make this shit too complicated
[5:14:56] viva_la_ham: i see mask on map
[5:14:57] BrokeMFClub: I feel like youre missing something?  It should clear from the map you would think.
