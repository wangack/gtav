[2:27:59] Lordbidwell: Yeah so you can make more and they can't pay it off sooner and you willl.loose money
[2:28:05] killogic916: Trying to lure poeple in by telling that another investment would get the 2% increase is super dangerous. They should only get the increase on the full reinvested 5 week return.
[2:28:46] killogic916: Some dude already said he was about to do 10k a week to get up his %
[2:28:53] nick_dr1ft: would be nice to also calculate the returns you have to give investors, so you can know how much Section K is earning pr. house right?
[2:29:30] Kdkuiper: @Lordbidwell if they cant pay it off, they can sell the house or rent to own with someone new and make everything back
[2:29:49] Lordbidwell: You have to be careful with them wanting to pay it off sooner and you will loose money that's why you did 8weeks
[2:29:49] Gashlex: probably need to cap their added increase. say they invest 10k first then after 5 weeks only allow like 2 times additional of what they put previously.
[2:30:39] sub_ohmu: You should have another sheet listing all investors and their %
[2:30:42] nick_dr1ft: yeah 1.1 total you ahve to give investors back including their 10k investments
[2:30:44] Gashlex: so it prevents the people from reinvesting the 10k for 5 times and to get 20% then drop 100k in. but the 2x limit still lets them grow
[2:30:49] marrinho24: Tax was 20% as well or K get the 4% back
[2:31:27] sub_ohmu: Yapp time

[2:44:37] BloodTiger_: I've really been enjoying palworld but man theres so super annoying bugs
[2:45:20] tread____: After watching Vinny after he got the house. People are going to miss a lot of payments the first week because of renters buying furniture gonna make a bunch of down payments back
[2:47:29] pustilence: late fees EZ money
[2:48:16] Nutty_Ballocks: it’s in the agreement
[2:50:10] Rigz007: timmacWIGGLE timmacWIGGLE timmacWIGGLE
[2:50:24] chill_lyn: timmacHMM
[2:51:26] zZEROo77: It'll be nice when you guys can open a company bank account
[2:52:58] DubbsG916: you have three closing parenthesis but only two opening
[2:53:18] C_G1: Do you have a list of the investors? It might be easier to reference a payout schedule per investor assuming 5 week withdrawal and input that cash flow into this
[2:53:39] Nutty_Ballocks: 1st week doesn’t go to investors right?
[2:54:08] Gashlex: issue is K used the downpayment to cover the house
[2:54:10] Gashlex: ya
[2:54:21] FizzyDrizzy420: yoooo
[2:54:37] C_G1: Exactly - you had to use the downpayment to pay the initial round of investors out- not the house
[2:54:38] Kdkuiper: youre prob always going to need to do that, going to be hard to get that much extra invested
[2:54:45] DubbsG916: @Gashlex could ended that statement after "issue is K"
[2:55:11] DubbsG916: Kappa Kappa
[2:56:03] Nutty_Ballocks: it will be a lot easier to track once the business account is in place
[2:56:20] Kdkuiper: where it will get real tricky is in 5 weeks youll need to have a lot of cash in hand to pay out investors their full amount back but wont have the house fully paid off
[2:56:22] Keiling1401: the only part of the whole thing that worries me is in 5 weeks when all these investors have to be paid back out their full investment amount, really makes it so that you have to keep getting people constantly
[2:56:34] C_G1: You realistically would need to get almost 350k of investments for this next house to cover the 1st houses investor payouts and weekly returns
[2:56:47] nova_rubio: Morning! How's it going so far TImmac?
[2:56:59] Gashlex: so with vinny rent to own your getting back 137k in rent so you still need to find 40k to cover the investor payback if they all take out
[2:57:37] C_G1: You have to assume everyone who invested will withdraw their money after the 5 weeks so you need 173k alone just sitting in case of withdrawals
[2:57:38] mrbiggies: K has 30 grand in the bank you should just have too cover the difference to get to 63, 000 to make it right

[2:57:40] pustilence: leveraged tot he hilt
[2:57:58] Kdkuiper: @Keiling1401 yeah excatly, when the house wont get paid off in 8 weeks, but the investment is promised to pay out in 5 weeks means more investments is needed to pay the old ones off
[2:58:40] GamerGoat007: Don't expect people to have the same vision as you and K in the long run honestly

[2:58:58] DickenXider: 5-10 reinvestments and you have a ponzi
[2:59:05] CopitoCAB: dont forget about the money from the rentals
[2:59:07] pustilence: people wil be interested once they see others getting paid out
[2:59:27] pustilence: and the hope is you get folks who invested 10k to put in even more now as well
[2:59:51] DickenXider: rto default and breech of contract is the true source
[2:59:55] Jasonam8: I sense some liquidations commanded by K a month from now
[3:00:30] mikedav17: Need more people like Murphy renting
[3:00:51] Kdkuiper: where itll pay off is if someone cant pay out their house and you can sell it or rent it out again
[3:00:52] YxtBomb: wouldnt it be x3 if its 5 week remaining?
[3:01:40] TheOne_TREYZZ: that 30 is towards next housse
[3:02:05] TheOne_TREYZZ: so already those contracts for that 30g started yesssterday for those clientsss

[3:02:24] doktou: Kate is the next house she has 55k ready to give as a downpayment

[3:02:35] CopitoCAB: u guys have money coming in from the rentals
[3:02:39] NoDeath: If K just sued the state for the backtaxes he would be getting around 63k

[3:03:07] EpicGriefer: he dead
[3:03:08] Kdkuiper: haha
[3:03:16] Hey_its_Mady: K paid him back his weekly
[3:03:28] YxtBomb: is he banned or dead lol
[3:03:51] EpicGriefer: perma i believe
[3:03:54] EpicGriefer: not sure
[3:03:57] sub_ohmu: yeah 25k in rentals
[3:03:58] Nutty_Ballocks: the first 2 properties
[3:04:01] EpicGriefer: ohh ban rip
[3:04:04] Kdkuiper: but the other properties all also have others needing to get paid out their investors
[3:04:19] sub_ohmu: 15k from cops then 2 renters at Wu Kang spot
[3:04:21] Kdkuiper: bc wuchang, he saying they will pay but not sure how
[3:04:23] NoDeath: K paid of a 29k and a 36k tax on the houses that was not declared when he bought them. He would get those back if he sued
[3:04:23] EpicGriefer: ohh yeah i remember now he was doin sketchy sht at snr buns
[3:04:31] redbeerdx: Wu chang just isnt paying yet, but it will be 15k from what i saw
[3:04:32] sub_ohmu: second spot is waiting for lolipop and more artist
[3:04:37] cbrooks51: 15 K a week from Couse 25K a week from Vinny’s house 10 K a week from wuchang house
[3:04:41] Nutty_Ballocks: wu Chang is in the 3rd unit in 2nd house
[3:04:43] YxtBomb: K only put the Armenians in there so far
[3:04:51] Hey_its_Mady: 15 + 10 since Wu Chang isn't paying anything yet
[3:04:57] TheOne_TREYZZ: 30k minus investors
[3:05:00] Gashlex: @YxtBomb not true he moved murphy in
[3:05:08] C_G1: 60-70% of that 30k weekly is investor
[3:05:11] YxtBomb: ohh word
[3:05:31] mrbiggies: You need to cover the difference of 33,000 of Vinnys down payment to make it right for the investers and start from 0 for Kate's house
[3:05:33] fuzzypeaches88: lol
[3:05:40] Hey_its_Mady: 6k
[3:06:04] DickenXider: minus material costs…. so you’re losing money for now until the empire exists
[3:06:07] YxtBomb: Do you guys charge a brokerage fee or is that just included in the markup?
[3:06:12] Kdkuiper: itll be rough for a while
[3:06:23] TheOne_TREYZZ: all that = K needs to get on that grind haha
[3:07:00] owenrogers10b: that’s not right, you own more than 20%
[3:07:02] Hey_its_Mady: You'll need new investors and some of your own to money to keep it rolling
[3:07:02] Kdkuiper: you and K have also given a lot of cash injection into these houses
[3:07:10] TheApatheticMike: there is someone willing to put down 100k for a downpayment for the next rent to own
[3:07:11] Yzma1: there is another rent to own on the way
[3:07:14] Nutty_Ballocks: the problem is the rent on rent to owns is going directly to the principal balance
[3:07:16] YxtBomb: i think transferring the police to 25k rent to own would fix some stuff
[3:07:19] fuzzypeaches88: K screwed the pooch with not over complicating in the beginning
[3:07:22] EpicGriefer: yeah  6
[3:07:22] C_G1: The first one you guys have 40% and second i think is 20%
[3:07:25] EpicGriefer: 2nd was 7
[3:07:25] doktou: 6
[3:07:34] cbrooks51: 6
[3:07:51] Kdkuiper: but if you eat c-dogs on both, that helps you a lot
[3:07:52] prxnce_rene: yh 2nd was 8 1st was 6
[3:07:55] EpicGriefer: ahh damn
[3:07:57] redbeerdx: siobhan did mention a refund for the taxes to K when its sorted
[3:08:07] owenrogers10b: you own 40% of 15k, then 20% of 15k
[3:08:14] owenrogers10b: you get me
[3:08:27] Yzma1: @YxtBomb i think they are only renting at the moment
[3:08:35] prxnce_rene: what does increasing rent do? right not each unit is priced at 5000£
[3:08:36] Cyno_R: This real estate thing can be alot of potential money
[3:08:50] sub_ohmu: Do you guys not have another spreadsheet tab with the list of investors, their amount invested, and date invested. So you can know exactly how much to buy back weekly/total?
[3:09:04] Kdkuiper: wont it be 50 and 30 if you guys dont pay out c-dogg?
[3:09:15] owenrogers10b: it’s gunna be lucrative in the long run just tight for a little while
[3:09:18] WhoKnowz21: ^
[3:09:19] DickenXider: you’re a g-d saint for making these tables and maths
[3:09:29] Kdkuiper: true
[3:09:51] prxnce_rene: contractually you still have to pay out big c dog
[3:09:53] EpicGriefer: how do you deal with C dog? since you only know OOC that hes gone, do you still have to keep paying out to him?
[3:10:16] owenrogers10b: I feel like you gotta pay him rent in case he comes back from ban, when it comes to sale of property you can work out whether to send him his cut
[3:10:27] nck_at_nite: comfort comes as you drop the percent that's investor funded
[3:10:29] mskazzeboy: ned 5
[3:10:39] prxnce_rene: can you afford to pay out all the investors right now?
[3:10:40] Kdkuiper: yeah you as "section K" have to keep injecting money yourself which is not helping either
[3:10:45] killogic916: in 5 weeks yall FUCKED unless theres like 2 more houses bought and being paid for
[3:10:52] killogic916: at least temporarly
[3:10:58] pattypump: kitty and ray mond want a rent to buy property
[3:11:18] killogic916: @pattypump getting poeple that want a house isnt the problem, tyheres like 10 poeple that want iot. Its the investors
[3:11:18] smokebreezy: Kate also
[3:11:22] nck_at_nite: fund investor payments with pounder runs lol
[3:11:24] YxtBomb: what how dont you get rent for them to move in?
[3:11:30] EpicGriefer: kate? also wants a house, just need the investors to buy it
[3:11:31] DickenXider: k collects deposit and a week from renters. unsure on RTO
[3:11:40] sym_biotic: I mean everyone wants to rent to own a property but theres not enough liquid investment out there
[3:11:44] YxtBomb: oh you dont get the inital rent payment on rent to own you only get down payment
[3:11:51] Jasonam8: I hope this temporary financial crunch leads to more of K hitting licks
[3:11:55] TheApatheticMike: does the 173 account for the 10% you guys promised throughout the 5 weeks too?
[3:12:06] owenrogers10b: you also gotta pay 10% back of that 30k too
[3:12:34] killogic916: You guys just need to hope like 75% of these initial investors want to reinvest so u dont have to cash them out.
[3:12:50] prxnce_rene: I think almost all the rent needs to go up asoon as the lease’s end
[3:13:16] Kdkuiper: yeah you guys need more bc in 5 weeks those first investments need full payouts and will hit hard
[3:13:46] EpicGriefer: anyone know if OTT ever invested?

[3:15:03] Spoober: @Rhizwynd Yeah he got 3 last night

[3:21:04] irishmf_24: As OTT said it's gonna be such a struggle for awhile before you see any return
[3:21:16] EpicGriefer: but would you get anything back if there was no law for it at the time?
[3:21:20] sym_biotic: you guys arent set to make a profit on the first two houses until the sale. Then with the new ones you dont make any money until the investors are paid after 6 weeks?
[3:21:45] Nutty_Ballocks: they won’t get tax free on the first two houses but maybe the rent to own
[3:21:50] fuzzypeaches88: come to jebus time
[3:22:01] TheApatheticMike: you would have to turn the 2 rent houses into rent to owns
[3:22:19] ronthebusiman: @killogic916 that’s even more reason to take your time and make sure it makes sense first, nobody else was going to do this so there was no rush
[3:22:26] prxnce_rene: probelm with rent to owns is its lost assets
[3:22:29] EpicGriefer: but going forward they should be tax free so more profits right?
[3:22:37] killogic916: You CANNOT let investers get 2% on new investments, only added % on the already invested money.
[3:22:38] sym_biotic: but you are locked with the police for 2 more weeks on that
[3:22:39] EpicGriefer: once law is passed that is
[3:22:40] Kdkuiper: you also need to set the max investment return to like 20 and no more
[3:22:50] AnnoyinMercenary: only way this works is if all the profit you do get, gets put back into buying more houses for rent to own
[3:22:51] Wyczolek: It's better to rent its free cash its not much but it will snowball no ?
[3:22:54] trader455: could prob convince the cops to rent to own
[3:23:03] killogic916: @ronthebusiman Its RP, going through shit like this is part of the content.... which ius reason to get iut going asap.
[3:23:14] ggsz: the police would probably agree to rent to own after the contract with them ends

[3:24:30] NoDeath: The first 2 houses are basically taxfree because it was never stated that there was tax when he bought them. K just needs to sue the state for 29k+36k
[3:25:13] tread____: All your problems get solved if/when K gets the taxes from the investment houses back
[3:25:27] Spoober: The rental units killed ya with the money to decorate
[3:25:29] EpicGriefer: that RP in court for the taxes will be entertaining
[3:25:35] tread____: That's like 60k
[3:25:59] NoDeath: Yeah unfortunately it seems like K forgot about it
[3:26:03] trader455: time to talk to k
[3:26:29] MissinMyTeeth: week 5 is gonna come around and ur gonna tell k you owe back investors 150k and he’s gonna be like what?! loll
[3:26:37] TheOne_TREYZZ: Sign investors for one house on one date, so contracts starts at the same time. Otherwise you sign investors, but there is no income for that contract for X time
[3:26:56] prxnce_rene: can you legally turn the 2 rentals into rent to owns without selling the houses first as per the contract?
[3:26:56] killogic916: @MissinMyTeeth huh?? u think K is that dense?
[3:27:08] iTzMeegra: incoming Ponzi scheme!!!!
[3:27:32] MissinMyTeeth: @killogic916 no he’s just gonna have to do a lot of looking back and see who paid what cause I don’t think he’s wrote things down
[3:27:35] ZeDank97: Its K's day off right?
[3:27:42] SFGMOD: @ZeDank97 no
[3:27:44] fuzzypeaches88: government housing loan
[3:27:46] doktou: no
[3:27:51] ZeDank97: Oh my B
[3:27:53] trader455: he’s around to
[3:27:54] killogic916: @MissinMyTeeth Its all in the contract folder on his phone
[3:27:55] iSTuBBZz: takes sat off
[3:27:57] notwowayzz: No he's off tomorrow
[3:27:57] tread____: The taxes on the houses is what's the problem it's like a 75k profit without them
[3:27:58] irishmf_24: He's on today
[3:28:02] eeikomS: @prxnce_rene once the rental contract is up yes
[3:28:06] sym_biotic: @MissinMyTeeth he has a contract for each person
[3:28:10] hippieh8rlol: hopefully the tax exempt stuff comes through. and maybe even some possible government housing deals
[3:28:18] fuzzypeaches88: bet you fab could hook it up with gov loan
[3:28:21] fuzzypeaches88: dab
[3:28:22] prxnce_rene: yeah just because the contract is very specific on selling the rentals and then paying out 10% so how would they just be converted to rent to owns
[3:28:33] killogic916: @fuzzypeaches88 there is no gov loans
[3:28:38] Keiling1401: def need a spreadsheet for all the investors, should get K to get all the info while hes around today so one can be put together
[3:28:39] iTzMeegra: Mr k is gonna be the new Berny Madolf
[3:28:46] arrogant_roleplay: It's gonna be even more entertaining sweating their balls off to a tax man, when they get audited IRL LOL. #DMCA #CORPORATE #ARPFUCK

[3:28:52] Rhizwynd: The thing is Mayor needs Treasurer approval to get the money, might be hard at this moment
[3:29:04] ZeDank97: I think you need 1 big shark
[3:29:08] ItsEdBoi_: I think missing in some rentals is gonna be key to have long term profits, flipping rent to owns are nice chunks but u lose the house after after
[3:29:12] iTzMeegra: only way to win is to get reimbursed for the taxes
[3:29:13] irishmf_24: Just talk with K when he's around and get him to make a spread sheet to keep track
[3:29:13] killogic916: Im p sure there isnt going to be gov loans in 4.0 at all
[3:29:14] hippieh8rlol: and are there asset fees or taxes coming?
[3:29:15] ItsEdBoi_: mixing*
[3:29:25] Hey_its_Mady: REIT legislation isn't passed yet. Once its approved you are excempt from taxes right?
[3:29:27] genericusernameuno: I feel like the original buying and renting was much better because you only had to pay when you had tenants or sold the house.
[3:29:43] tread____: Your only paying all the investors a total of around 20k so each house is like 65k profit
[3:29:49] eeikomS: @hey_its_mady if it gets approved yah
[3:29:54] Wyczolek: @genericusernameuno Yeah
[3:30:01] arrogant_roleplay: Why you stuttering bro?
[3:30:03] arrogant_roleplay: lmfao
[3:30:12] killogic916: Payback date
[3:30:17] eeikomS: @arrogant_roleplay ?
[3:30:20] EpicGriefer: is REIT legislation being voted on saturday or sunday?
[3:30:21] killogic916: so u know when u need their full cash by
[3:30:25] sub_ohmu: should do a check box too for each week paid back
[3:30:28] tread____: After 3 houses there's no need for as many investors
[3:30:29] sub_ohmu: 1-5
[3:30:35] arrogant_roleplay: @eeikomS #Arrogantfuck
[3:30:58] arrogant_roleplay: Peace Glizzy slingers
[3:31:09] YxtBomb: insert drop down

[3:31:24] eeikomS: @tread____ yah it’s gonna be tight  the first couple of houses
[3:31:54] irishmf_24: One thing I don't get is K gave 25% to OTT of the business but hasn't received a single cent from him to inject into the business
[3:32:13] SFGMOD: OTT hasn't done much of anything yet
[3:32:17] Blackhawk_TB21: to be honest...it's probably better to put a date rather than a check box for payouts
[3:32:33] hippieh8rlol: @irishmf_24 OTT is in the real estate game IRL. he brings a ton of knowledge and ideas
[3:32:43] sub_ohmu: @irishmf_24 Yeah, but OTT has also help with his expertise
[3:32:47] EpicGriefer: OTT helped quit a bit just hasent injected money
[3:32:49] Nutty_Ballocks: yeah OTT needs to put in money if he is a 25% owner
[3:32:55] eeikomS: @irishmf_24 pretty sure he gave k 20k two days ago
[3:33:00] fuzzypeaches88: agreed
[3:33:08] Keiling1401: OTT told K he had a guy doing 20k, and another that wants to do a Rent 2 Own with 100k down
[3:33:16] eeikomS: idk if that was his money or investor money
[3:33:39] prxnce_rene: gotta factor in the compound interest
[3:33:44] killogic916: @eeikomS that was an investor

[3:33:55] Wyczolek: I have one question if they put 10k in 5 weeks you have to pay them 10% it means 2.2k per week or 200dl per week and after 5 weeks pay back 10k or reinvest it for 12%?
[3:34:06] genericusernameuno: Real experience irl doesn't help because the time frames for rent to buys doesn't work in the city.
[3:34:14] sub_ohmu: need to change format to percentage
[3:34:18] ItsEdBoi_: D2*1+E2
[3:34:21] prxnce_rene: put 1.10%
[3:34:26] Blackhawk_TB21: D*E+D
[3:34:27] eeikomS: @prxnce_rene compound interest isn’t a factor until after week 5 right?
[3:34:30] JCAnderson1983: =D2+(D2*E2)
[3:34:32] ItsEdBoi_: yep
[3:34:34] prxnce_rene: no 1.1 and multiply them
[3:34:35] kingdizy_: D2* (1+E2)
[3:34:43] ItsEdBoi_: u need * not just ()
[3:34:55] killogic916: @Wyczolek 200 per week then their 10k back at the end of 5 weeks.
[3:34:59] Rhizwynd: easier to put rate at 1.1
[3:35:25] sub_ohmu: D2/5
[3:35:37] sub_ohmu: just d2/5
[3:35:55] nick_dr1ft: yup that seems right
[3:36:03] raalenn: @sub_ohmu that would be 20%
[3:36:21] ItsEdBoi_: Yea
[3:36:28] ZeDank97: Hope Gomer gets paid for the amount of work be puts in
[3:37:26] irishmf_24: K should start working a job like G6 or something to be bringing in money aswell 😂
[3:37:54] raalenn: not even streamers are safe from spreadsheets
[3:38:04] TheApatheticMike: no, just loss LUL
[3:38:09] marius_mac10: the redneck accountant
[3:38:11] sub_ohmu: Try =c2+7*(5)
[3:38:21] killogic916: @irishmf_24 K aint doing no civ job
[3:38:27] cbrooks51: A nice injection of cash from OTT would be helpful

[3:39:05] Rhizwynd: 28 days is 5 weeks
[3:39:07] sub_ohmu: that's the date, 7 days(week) (5 = 5 weeks)
[3:39:15] raalenn: 28 days is not 5 weeks
[3:39:24] sub_ohmu: 7 is the week
[3:39:28] reido__speedo: no its not lol
[3:39:30] sub_ohmu: 5 is the 7 days, 5 weeks
[3:39:32] KautoStars: K has a much easier time getting people to say yes to the investments than OTT thats for sure
[3:39:33] 3tonDoubleXL: Feb 1st
[3:39:34] Rhizwynd: oh right my bad
[3:39:40] ItsEdBoi_: Try C2+7*(insert what week ur calculating) - Today()
[3:39:43] reido__speedo: 35 days is 5 weeks
[3:39:46] JCAnderson1983: then minus todays date
[3:39:52] sub_ohmu: *(5) for 5 weeks
[3:39:53] prxnce_rene: power of n+1
[3:40:07] sym_biotic: @cbrooks51 tbh the best injection of cash would be the boys taking the weed money and then running that through the REIT to then gain 10% on top of that and clean it completely on the books
[3:40:07] doktou: OTT send you a message
[3:40:08] 3tonDoubleXL: KEKW 1900
[3:40:10] JCAnderson1983: change the format to number instead of date
[3:40:39] ItsEdBoi_: u need it to adjust based on the checkboxes of what week they are on
[3:40:39] reido__speedo: Today - c2
[3:40:47] killogic916: so 28 instead of 7?
[3:41:02] raalenn: 35 if its 5 weeks
[3:41:04] kingdizy_: 35 instead of 7
[3:41:10] reido__speedo: nevermind dont listen to me wouldnt work lol
[3:41:11] prxnce_rene: are you from Toronto?
[3:41:23] Spoober: waiting for the conditionals to turn it red when it is overdue
[3:41:33] raalenn: then you need a column for each payment no?
[3:41:41] killogic916: you want both the weekly payment dat AND the big payment date probablky
[3:41:45] Rhizwynd: week 1 6 days. week 2 is week 1 + 7 etc
[3:41:45] C_G1: So you need a weekly payout date column and initial investment return date column
[3:41:48] ItsEdBoi_: U need to do a complicated If statement based on if the checkboxes are true or false
[3:41:59] kingdizy_: weekly should be same date for everyone tbh. makes things way to complicated
[3:42:01] ItsEdBoi_: and adjust the weeks accordingly
[3:42:24] reido__speedo: are you looking for days until payment as final payment in 5 weeks or week 1 payment?
[3:42:36] ItsEdBoi_: Try C2+7*(insert what week ur calculating) - Today() < so that and insert based on if statement
[3:43:00] raalenn: the fi statement on the checkboxes is the most elegant but yeah requires the if statement

[3:43:36] sub_ohmu: week 3 just change to 3

[3:44:30] reido__speedo: C2 - TODAY() + 35
[3:44:30] Blackhawk_TB21: This works in Excel for days left to pay =DATE(2024,02,24)-NOW()
[3:44:36] Spoober: you shouldn't need a today if the date is there +days
[3:44:43] sub_ohmu: you need the brackets
[3:44:43] Blackhawk_TB21: If the due date was Feb 24
[3:44:52] BloodTiger_: I just joined in, can I get a quick TLDR, might be able to help
[3:44:57] reido__speedo: but do 7
[3:45:00] reido__speedo: 14
[3:45:02] reido__speedo: 21 etc
[3:45:06] trader455: easy solution don't pay the investors and go under a new name and move to a new country
[3:45:16] mwcarroll: =((C2+7)*[week number])-TODAY()

[3:45:22] kingdizy_: ((C2+7)*1)-Today()
[3:45:24] ItsEdBoi_: Work on something else ill work on it on my own sheet and get u the formula
[3:45:29] sub_ohmu: days*
[3:46:03] mwcarroll: change the C2 to C$2 if you want to copy/paste

[3:55:24] JCAnderson1983: I made a formula for Column D that will change when you check a box and recalculate for the next week
[3:55:32] ItsEdBoi_: Problem is that u guys didnt have enough investors to start the downpayment went to buying the house not to the float
[3:55:37] prxnce_rene: right now there’s no float, k put in all the down payment into buying to cover for lack of investors
[3:55:48] nova_rubio: It is cause K used the downpayment to buy the house
[3:56:18] kingdizy_: ott spot on lmao, right now its the start of a ponzi
[3:56:31] MrYeOLDsNIPeR: lol, maybe you'll get money back from Taxes paid on the 3 properties.

[6:00:15] Ryan_McDaniel: It's kind of like the mechanic shop. doesn't matter if the job changes, you're still doing the speadsheets :D
[6:00:37] Gashlex: so that means mirror park has higher potential over southside cause it would be 142% increase if you first in
[6:00:38] Ryan_McDaniel: It totally makes sense, just an observation.
[6:00:39] dailydoseofdylan: @ItsEdBoi_ yeah this is great, now we need to figure out all that have invested and most likely separate the initial investors for the 10%.

[6:01:01] ItsEdBoi_: @ItsEdBoi_ Yea they can just fill in the names
[6:01:33] Nzlaten: That'll be down the line rn it's all groups buying not individuals
[6:02:06] ItsEdBoi_: U also upsell the upfronting of the cost and they will recoup most of the value in the market price rising and the rest is for the service
[6:02:16] fiction12211: Mirror park house would be nice
[6:02:51] ItsEdBoi_: Was annoying to figure out but once u get one u just copy and paste

[8:10:18] Gashlex: if the quality of plant is based on who plants it. but anyone can get the rep from harvest that is great
[8:10:34] killogic916: @tim_schu They have bigger racks now so i dont think that a problem anymore
[8:10:55] killogic916: @Gashlex it isnt, its based on the quality of seeds/fert you use.
