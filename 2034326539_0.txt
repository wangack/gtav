[2:17:11] Wardiel_: or make it copyable, to put in a note maybe?
[2:17:12] ELTanqu3: Im excited to see you remember the ip address now KEKW @kyliebitkin
[2:17:15] moe_uwu: I mean can you not have both programs on the pc side by side if they are both installed on the pc ?
[2:17:15] prodiac: Based on his explanation, the two apps need to be built into 1, where you do the scan, and then you select one, you and you get to crack that one. The others go away
[2:17:20] ViolentAkuma: I think you have to pick one and that's it maybe
[2:17:25] Isen_Mage: it'd be such a simple change. Just randomize the lists again after 1 is successfully hacked so you can't repeat
[2:17:25] Qyuyu: so you do it with someone by your side with a notebook and you tell him the numbers?
[2:17:26] kingcloudii: unless it came from an admin i wouldnt believe it tbh
[2:17:29] KewlKittyProductions: won't have to remember it

[2:17:50] TriplSkipp: note papers?! in this economy?! KEKW
[2:17:50] Tronno: The IP is easy, it's the mac addresses
[2:17:50] candorus: having to memorize a mac address and IP address in 10 seconds seems a little crazy...but that's probably just me
[2:17:50] moe_uwu: Yeah you say the address out loud to be written IC or whatever
[2:17:51] Xergers_Lorak: you can do notes on the pc so
[2:17:52] Xistoid: showed a blurred list with the difficulty and when u click 1 it shows the adress and ip

[12:24:58] Harcini: JJ will be so excited
[12:25:01] mugcostanza: kyliebList
[12:25:02] eborcurean: 30k means 1.2k  per blueprint and then the costs on top
[12:25:04] Khul_Sardaukar: pity u cant just supplement mechanic work with car sales profit
[12:25:08] BakinPacman: the material price is pretty negligible at that profit amount
[12:25:09] dragonsfire027: there a lot of upsides to this deal
[12:25:11] ThePitfallover: JJ will go crazy in the AU with these
[12:25:11] Trawls421: need some backup so you dont get stabbed after transaction

[12:26:29] MurphyDH: Having the blueprint will help with moving chopped parts too
[12:26:31] fuga_sk: regardless this also pushes ppl in the group to chop
[12:26:31] ibruticus: Damn Mary gonna have a nice drop for Yeager tomorrow KEKW
[12:26:31] Darkri19: getting soliders to sell them aswell if they struggling to make 10k a week
[12:26:37] HotCocoaGamer: What if Vinny undercuts again lol
[12:26:38] mugcostanza: kyliebMwiggle
[12:26:41] Spelliepanda: @Anubiks peepoSigh ok you slep well and good for interesting stuff tomorrow
[12:26:42] eborcurean: 30k 5 at 5 is not the same
[12:26:45] Trawls421: where the hell is your soldiers
[12:26:46] Bairt_: also a deal with Sonya builds a bridge
[12:26:50] Jarathin: yeah selling some to him and selling at the same price would be big
[12:26:53] ThePitfallover: would the guild have issues with open selling on the market?
[12:26:56] arcticOP: well u cna do it and have jj sell on AU
[12:26:59] PsychoBKilla: Its worth it
[12:26:59] arcticOP: vinny isont on
[12:27:00] rmcgowan: If Vinny undercuts her, he basically undermines his profit model
[12:27:03] Thefat16: with guild doing sani they might be able to make some money while undercutting vinny for mary as well nodd
[12:27:03] spicychickenzz: nodd
[12:27:04] Myki_Cameda: 30 minutes each crafting
[12:27:05] TekEvolution: Vinny undercutting won't be able to run mechanic shop
[12:27:06] Xergers_Lorak: Just playing Vinny game uncut KEKW
[12:27:08] comfycathie: long term roi
[12:27:10] mugcostanza: kyliebList yuh, it works on couple levels
[12:27:10] Tronno: YEP
[12:27:11] bwehn: mhm

[12:27:13] BakinPacman: having good business relations with someone is good to
[12:27:14] shpuddie: YEP
[12:27:18] Kascade418: Making Vinny sell less crowbars and crowbars for less are both victories
[12:27:19] lSoltisl: don't sell them under mosley's, is better to have a third party sell them
[12:27:19] Tritonesubstitution: YEP
[12:27:19] macrotoad: also worth furthering the Sonya Crew trust
[12:27:20] PsychoBKilla: They wont be able to do their free repairs
[12:27:23] Thorsstar: only to sell 6-7 to make your money back at 5K
[12:27:25] itaraa1043: kyliebLul
[12:27:27] d1n0ni: What if they buy it all and sold it back at their own price
[12:27:29] greatmuta2: It's about the MESSAGE
[12:27:29] Trawls421: and Moselys will still be standing

[12:27:30] RuinedSpacer: As long as she gets 1.2k per, she breaks even
[12:27:31] jd51823: YEP
[12:27:32] Draxonus: exactly nodd
[12:27:32] Fr0stwav3: KEKW if Vinny and Chip undercuts again, it just lowers worth as a connection to the ADMC
[12:27:33] Darkri19: plus it also helps KC fund sewer trips
[12:27:34] Jarathin: this is big
[12:27:35] tedium7: nodd worth it just for that
[12:27:37] Watermeliton: nodd its good
[12:27:37] spicychickenzz: if it sinks his shop it helps the repair industry
[12:27:43] failzfosterz: its the smart play
[12:27:44] rmcgowan: Yeah. It gets her crew a crowbar. It gets her allies crowbars. It undercuts her primary business rival. Even if she LOST money on this deal, it's a huge win
[12:27:45] PsychoBKilla: nodd
[12:27:49] vishalpharate: hi how are you?
[12:27:50] comfycathie: great for the mechanics too
[12:27:51] darkestnight333: Yep this isn't about short term profit this is about knee capping the issue, before it can stand fully
[12:27:52] mikecrashes: you shorten the time frame to happy thoughts
[12:27:53] treeshark: It will hemorrhage the competition almost instantly
[12:27:54] BakinPacman: 30k is pretty solid this early
[12:27:55] bwehn: investing in your future NODDERS
[12:27:56] Xergers_Lorak: +1 with Sonya

[12:28:02] vishalpharate: good morning
[12:28:06] SrSlimey: @thepitfallover I believe they weren’t happy with it, Idk about now.
[12:28:06] BakinPacman: they can always change that price as the crowbars drop in price
[12:28:09] BakinPacman: etc
[12:28:10] Jakeman951: + quild rep
[12:28:11] Goldflux: can give one to yiggy too nodd

[12:28:27] SirRagnas: need a briefcase
[12:28:27] rmcgowan: With JJ around, you will sell through these so fast in AU
[12:28:28] cyphert3xt: House fund  - 30k
[12:28:32] Trawls421: you need some soldiers with you
[12:28:33] ThePitfallover: the frothing at the mouth on twatter tomorrow though pepeW
[12:28:36] BeRyce913: for the amount of griding it takes to get the bp
[12:28:40] Pyromanen15: to just get to sell crowbars, it's not the best deal, for all of the other benefits it brings, it makes a lot of sense
[12:28:43] Blake2493: also soon you might be taking irish and his boys away from popular too
[12:28:43] mikecrashes: side note you need on call backup
[12:28:46] BORAT_VERYNICE: it also shows you are willing to patch a relationship that was once a negative
[12:28:51] zachps: Wionel
[12:28:52] bwehn: Lionel protec NODDERS
[12:28:54] Jarathin: +1 rep for Sonya too.
