[0:13:01] alwaysthefriend_: well, imagine the cost of it
[0:13:13] apaceboldface: there like 500 a piece ain‚Äôt they?
[0:13:20] alwaysthefriend_: probably $40,000 in materials
[0:13:20] dr_rick16: k put flooring top bench maybe?
[0:13:32] darkdemonwiz: I would just delete the unplaced stuff, if you add all that stuff without doing rooms correctly it will just lag
[0:13:35] onilaa4: House designers are overcooking with the interior LUL
[0:13:54] cybigil: Yeah, seems exessive.  You are only missing out of 0.6 BTC over 24 hours.  Probably not that big of a deal.
[0:14:09] radadventures: I think large is $300 and extra large $500 each
[0:14:41] notdigink: think used on the rental house
[0:14:54] jross6481: he used it on the house next door

[0:24:00] apaceboldface: 6300
[0:24:05] sickbound: plus tax
[0:24:25] darkzoner: dont buy all in one go. probably wont fit in pockets
[0:24:29] MangoGioU: Make sure you have space in your inventory or they will poof
[0:24:41] g33j4y: yeah not worth
[0:24:47] theogbigg: cheaper way to do it but its meta

[0:26:45] theogbigg: we on the right path
[0:27:38] radadventures: walls are more needed to separate the basement out imo
[0:28:07] g33j4y: should probably only design with the parts u have
[0:28:16] dejus12: 1000% agree
[0:28:29] garett789: Truth
[0:28:31] sickbound: make sire you finalise it before you go off
[0:28:34] sickbound: sure*
[0:28:36] wavydiego1: they do it so K can check it out if he likes it or change stuff
[0:28:55] theogbigg: no one is willing to cough up the change or too poor to do so thats the problem
[0:29:09] Whatshisface117: The walls don't really degrade right. Should be getting that stuff first
[0:29:18] Sweetchilly7: I think 90% was there but k used it on the rentals:)
[0:29:29] 88eg: the rack might go elsewhere too since the other desk is moved
[0:29:39] dejus12: rumors are lil tuggz might be back soon
[0:29:55] theogbigg: Big day for mr.k
[0:29:55] notdigink: major investment day

[0:30:12] mmajeter2: huge day for section k
[0:30:18] NewFallout: It would be nice if you can set a Work Order like Old Benny where you Design the house you want, have a total material count needed for a building and people can go do deliveries to properties
[0:30:27] YaBroChad: it actually was a very good day for Section K stuff

[0:35:23] o0mpALoompA: I'd be worried about people scuffing through the floor when entering the house and seeing the basement.
[0:35:26] CreamOwww: a nice entrance would be like ramees room at the cubby like a small wall way and you need to press Q to slide in and you can also hide the small entrance with some carpet or towel
[0:35:39] g33j4y: yeah can easily cut down on that shit

[0:38:06] MangoGioU: Paris did the design but had no bushes so had to wait on Carmella
[0:38:07] ThreeNPink: wipe it all out and put the rack
[0:38:08] Galacticowboy: it's the new bushes
[0:38:10] NewFallout: Function getting put behind Design no good
[0:38:12] notdigink: that's why get the YP decorated down here
[0:38:18] g33j4y: i think someone needs to tell them they have to be more efficient
[0:38:30] Lepaca: not your headache if other people leave shit unfinished
[0:38:35] jasonquinn2022: Carmella just got the bush unlock yesterday
[0:38:45] darkk_2k: They want to finish that but someone wanted to rent the other house so they did that first to get them started

[0:39:48] ThreeNPink: ye
[0:39:53] Galacticowboy: somebody gotta finish it once and for all just to be done with it
[0:39:58] notdigink: the basement ground is soooo scuff cause of the trash bags
[0:39:58] irishmf_24: Ray Romanov is sick at doing these things
[0:39:59] o0mpALoompA: Calling it now, the basement's gonna look like a crackhouse forever
[0:40:04] darkk_2k: Its kinda obvious too tha\t its hiding something
[0:40:05] YaBroChad: That's what I was wondering, better to make the spot where it gets the most use look good
[0:40:11] notdigink: @irishmf_24 their house is insaneee
[0:40:12] Galacticowboy: k just wants the bushes then he doesn't care
[0:40:13] Hey_its_Mady: Honestly the girls are not doing any favours decorating houses. They spend too much time to decorate, Don't care about the cost and don't even finish their designs LUL LUL

[0:43:41] Galacticowboy: you just gotta get the supplies in the storage and click the button don't you
[0:43:43] NewFallout: Biggest thing that feels off is they slammed three floors in a two story building

[2:29:15] Null_Value: Grime might be worth if it handled something with the stores/businesses stock/economy.
[2:29:29] apaceboldface: it would tank his grime to 0
[2:29:34] FogRawGaming: Grime should have some utility. Maybe once business licenses start going out
[2:29:35] ClassifiedGnar: wat if u could get gun bp from the from the ammo packer run kekw
[2:29:44] LarBearTV: the atm shit is bad imo... you have to put your own cash and you make 5% at most so 5k off 100k
[2:29:49] Galacticowboy: na ppl gonna start robbing the shit out of G6
[2:29:49] itsTenVi: you know as soon as you did that they would change grime to have something pog and you would have lost so much rep

[2:29:53] LunarEffectt: Gomie is the CG ATM thats why he down bad
[2:30:16] oofles_sadface: it would be cool if the packer had like random "extra" packages that has some sort of sellable loot or something useable
[2:30:26] g33j4y: yeah some people didn't want to invest with K because they can just do a quick g6 for the same money
[2:30:29] Yonz: G6 has alot of player so more stuff got unlock but less player around grime so no unlock
[2:30:41] Yonz: that my way of thinkinganyway
[2:30:55] ItsEdBoi_: g6 got Nmp

[2:31:34] apaceboldface: Grime was more popular than G6 than they nerf it and everyone went to G6
[2:31:38] BakinPacman: its just probably the pipeline of stuff being released
[2:31:47] Rosco_RT: at least you have a sweet car!
[2:31:50] LunarEffectt: Did hunting ever become worth anything
[2:31:53] Am0nthegreat: At most, I would assume there might be Plane contracts after Packer maybe.
[2:32:07] ItsEdBoi_: Pounder is still great money, packers just seems so not worth the investment
[2:32:12] MrYeOLDsNIPeR: Grime is probably going to be big later on in the game.

[2:41:03] irishmf_24: The fact they force it for you to lose rep if you want to do other jobs which is so dumb should be allowed do other jobs without tanking your rep
[2:41:03] mattt210: yea people that run grime for 8 hrs straight
[2:41:08] Galacticowboy: so no more 3k runs?
[2:41:11] apaceboldface: maybe if they remodeled grime like g6 have tier contract
[2:41:15] tatteddads365: Just hate how it's almost encouraging this hardcore grinding
[2:41:23] MrYeOLDsNIPeR: The whole point was to keep people from Grinding over RP. Or am I way off with that?
[2:41:38] Lordbidwell: Sounds like it isn't a grime problem.  It's a money grinder problem
[2:41:41] mattt210: they should just limit it like chopping 1 a night cycle
[2:41:45] codfcbanter: i think it should be like 3.0 where there was a limit on the amount of runs you could do
[2:41:47] Ma1ne91: i think when no one drives packer dey cant fix the job
[2:41:55] WallyWeaver: ahhh MR k money bank is back ahaha
[2:42:19] Hey_its_Mady: But then other people are also no life grinding other jobs. You can't just put blame on people only doing grime
[2:42:23] MrYeOLDsNIPeR: have we made a High Box yet?
[2:42:29] Galacticowboy: ya seems way too grindy and way too nerf troll, I get they don't want ppl getting too far ahead but shit
[2:42:34] Teradactylman: Yeah the issue with grime is that it adds nothing to other sectors in the economy like sanitation and lumber jacker do

[2:44:28] apaceboldface: k selling Vinny 190k house before tax for 275k
[2:44:33] tatteddads365: The only problem with the real estate is that it's invest a lot now to make a shit ton 4 months from now
[2:44:35] Galacticowboy: Binny almost borderline not even cg he basically lives in another house
[2:44:41] Hey_its_Mady: Does sanitation affect grime rep?

[3:49:21] KryptSweetie: @Timmac 500 is really reasonable
[3:49:23] MrYeOLDsNIPeR: he's been fun to talk to
[3:49:28] Galacticowboy: $1 for a pallet of dirty money is fucked
[3:49:50] Galacticowboy: YEP
[3:49:57] Azzarill: it is
[3:50:03] NixusTV: It is
[3:50:04] TheWooD115: Yep
[3:50:04] apaceboldface: if fence was not in sewer for sure. yeah it a dollar
[3:50:05] cleanfijian32: it is
[3:50:06] MrYeOLDsNIPeR: $1 thing seems to be a scuff... just doesn't make any sense.
[3:50:08] Pazz: it‚Äôs 15
[3:50:12] ItsEdBoi_: think they changed it to 15
[3:50:14] tatteddads365: @kryptsweetie no I'm sorry to hear that. But you know you always got family here might be internet family but we're family
[3:50:19] BiGGHydro: 15 I heard but not much different
[3:50:25] xJOKURv: you can sell a wooden pallet with no money for more lol
[3:50:33] ItsEdBoi_: but still u can carry like 2 of them
[3:50:39] KryptSweetie: @tatteddads365 timmacH hossLove hossFlower

[3:50:49] TheWooD115: Gomers getting piiiiiiiiiiiiiisssssed
[3:50:50] ericmw: not even money,rolled bills, which you then have to wash and then clean
[3:50:57] BiGGHydro: LUL LUL
[3:50:58] StaticZapper: I'm assuming that's the point, to make it not worth to steal
[3:51:06] tatteddads365: @kryptsweetie timmacH hossLove shotzSl
[3:51:11] ItsEdBoi_: @ItsEdBoi_ Yep sooo good, while car parts are 120
[3:51:15] Galacticowboy: it makes no sense at all
[3:51:26] sychotixx: If they want it to not be worth it, why bother with the mechanic?
[3:51:30] Azzarill: to stop you robing them ?
[3:51:38] Galacticowboy: it's a trend I'm noticing in 4.0
[3:51:38] MrYeOLDsNIPeR: Shouldn't be able to steal it period if that's the case. "Don't make it an option"
[3:51:43] tatteddads365: @kryptsweetie oh I finished my business management and accounting degree from
[3:51:50] apaceboldface: plus it g6
[3:51:52] BiGGHydro: It has the be a rep thing as well no?
[3:52:14] ericmw: Buddha's stated plan to boost civilian activity is working well to be fair. make crime pay less
[3:52:16] StaticZapper: could be a bigger unlock yet to be known
[3:52:21] ItsEdBoi_: Grime boxes and normal g6 bags makes sense, but tier 3 pallets of money going into the main vault of the city should be worth robbing
[3:52:36] KryptSweetie: @tatteddads365 ooo congratulations !! Still have the tattoo shop going?

[3:52:44] ItsEdBoi_: U spend more on bandages going to fence than the worth of the items
[3:52:50] begixdxd: Robbing G6 is high risk with very low reward
[3:53:02] tatteddads365: @kryptsweetie yeah actually I have two shops now I'm in the middle of working on my back piece right now as we speak
[3:53:06] MrYeOLDsNIPeR: Gomer... you can't drive with him on your lap... it's not safe
[3:53:23] KryptSweetie: @tatteddads365 SOOO COOL !! happy for you my friend
[3:53:34] xJOKURv: 4.0 gonna be a civ server ? lol if they making crime be bad to do
[3:53:41] BanditWeazle: If that's the case then why is To deter from stealing, then why is just remove the mechanic of being able to sell the pallets or boxes
[3:53:51] tatteddads365: @kryptsweetie finishing up the stencil their appointment is at 10:00. Thank you very much
[3:54:36] ItsEdBoi_: I can see like jacking a whole truck being worth it kinda, but thats it
[3:54:47] BanditWeazle: Right you're not gonna get that with fifteen dollars a pallet
[3:55:00] MrYeOLDsNIPeR: here's a $1 for trying ... kekw
[3:55:09] Pazz: bahahahah
[3:55:36] Lordbidwell: All you get 8s a welcome to  grime post it note
[3:55:57] highway27: I know I've been watching less and less 4.0
[3:55:59] ItsEdBoi_: It should at least be worth the same as the g6 drivers get per
[3:56:03] begixdxd: 150 each would be a lot, iirc X & Ming robbed a full truck and there were 40
[3:56:34] BanditWeazle: The crime has to be more profitable than the fif you get caught
[3:56:43] maggiras: t3 grime is probably buffed .,. and noone knows because its so expensive to get there @Timmac
[3:56:43] BanditWeazle: Fine
[3:56:44] itsTenVi: I think they will give it a time of day when people start opening player businesses like new food places
[3:56:49] KryptSweetie: Highest you can go with group6 you can own a ATM too
[3:57:11] apaceboldface: I think you could get gun attachment from packer contract
[3:57:15] begixdxd: G6 is busted OP right now
[3:57:24] Lordbidwell: We know

[4:12:21] Bloob123: 4k and more scuff
[4:12:45] Lordbidwell: It's just a bugged mess of a truck that is made of glass still, so good luck
[4:12:49] ItsEdBoi_: g6 does have a good RP group thing going so rewarding that is nice, if grime could get trucker radios it would be so good
[4:13:15] Mr_Jhin4: they better hotfix that atm stuff cuz people been making 30k pasive a day on top of their g6 jobs that pay 6k KEKW
[4:13:17] 8R00KS: group 6 looks more interesting and more rp anyways
[4:13:33] Lordbidwell: As soon as you do they gonna nerf it the Gomer affect
[4:13:36] Albiwal: They should make it so the more g6 that is delivered the less they make within a time frame. How many money deliveries does a place really need
[4:13:39] evilgun77: as you swap the nerf it
[4:13:51] ItsEdBoi_: Meta slave
[4:13:51] Lordbidwell: Not wrong
[4:14:01] 8R00KS: There are lots of ways to improve grime its just getting ignored atm
[4:14:08] Lordbidwell: Always how it happens
[4:14:11] darkk_2k: It would make sense if they are already worth robbing
[4:14:18] ItsEdBoi_: g6 nerfs have to be incoming so many ppl are just grinding it
[4:14:21] Pazz: ott been timmacRAGE  also. lost 90 packages driving into the ground
