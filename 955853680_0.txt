[8:00:03] karrotkake0: Buy In? uhnSuffer
[8:00:04] YugenKNG: is oxy not as useful as 2.0 anymore or just that there's no need since civ rp so far?

[8:00:51] valorant_godlike: It takes too long and the risk is very big @UberHaxorNova payout is not a lot
[8:00:51] fckrobinhood: just cancel it and wait again
[8:00:52] DrZombieGamer: if you do as many runs as you can with one list, it is around 500 a run each buyin. im assuming you can get 6 per list roughfly
[8:00:52] TheRarePotato: @Nochaa no, I mean with the price Saaz selling it to Speedy they get 7-10k profit each
[8:00:54] DaJomz: lmao that suspension makes me nervous

[8:01:16] Nochaa: @therarepotato oh ok, thought you meant 1 cook is 7k, ty
[8:01:18] sapeur: i feel like most people will just wait around to rob people than rather do the work themselves which increases the risk to almost not worth it
[8:01:20] MurdocEd: I think houses are on a rep system also, get better houses with time
[8:01:22] S13M: it's 1k, good for about 3 runs

[8:01:50] YugenKNG: @3xevilx i see, why did they have to do that though? economy in NP is too rough atm to do crimes?
[8:01:52] DrZombieGamer: Vpn is a worthwhile investment even not counting the oxy runs i feel if your a criminal
[8:01:55] ubermorph1000: you killed those locals uhnCry
