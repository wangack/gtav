[0:50:53] mavericks312: now that civ jobs are paying well evenly, now they need to focus on crim jobs
[0:50:57] theace8869: Maybe Nunu should get her record expunged

[0:51:11] Tenivir: Eugene keeps his in apartment yeah
[0:51:15] Tueur562: Wouidn't making Graphics cards and selling them all profit more? Then use that money to buy more materials, etc, until you have enough to fill your racks?
[0:51:26] qihk: or have 1 crate for the boys and the other crate for girls

[0:51:47] kayleee13: @loekup it was her money
[0:51:48] Tenivir: loekup no she washed her cash from heists, not gems, if you dont know then why saying LUL
[0:51:49] mavericks312: @fralex010 tbf she wasn‚Äôt paid for any of the previous heists, this is why Eugene wanted payouts per heist and not house money
[0:51:50] Crewcabanger24: doing small runs is better than nothing
[0:51:50] 0livesleft: hmm

[0:53:27] CRlCK: @Sylik16 ALL LOTR PLEASE
[0:53:49] Tenivir: it is literally close to double the money to do the hot run
[0:53:51] TangiblePear: I feel like Crime would work better if you could just always be signed into certain crime jobs, and you just get offered jobs whenever randomly ( maybe tied to police online) But you can do other jobs at same time. Make crime 100% seperate
[0:53:53] Tenivir: for same amount of gems
[0:53:56] Nulltiply: KEKW
