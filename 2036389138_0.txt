[1:24:13] Baldweiser5G: Chatting
[1:24:13] khrow: its a bummer, the chat makes even good interactions weird sometimes
[1:24:15] Revdudeson: Oh I think that he leans into it sometimes. But largely I think he just wants to do his thing and his chat all wants to be a part of it IG
[1:24:17] HalfEsse: x is RPing really well rn; before he had a decent amount of trolling mixed in, but all of his gta rp content is right on the dot lately

[1:42:25] Drpopcorn: it's so funny all you had to do was RP with wrangler without being a dumbass and you'd get away with so much shit
[1:42:31] humanhere2: Wrangler always like to push things that would cause a big reaction.... that shouldn't cause such a big reaction a lot of the time.... and he'd just lean in.  Fun RP, IMO

[1:45:07] azmer1987: Satisfying ending for me only and always lol
[1:45:10] ens0mniac: the problem with Penta’s characters is that it always seems like him and his chat got off on making people break character and get OOC mad instead of how most people try to make people break by making them laugh @esfandtv
[1:45:11] TehJoker14780: @The_YellowMist whitelist removed because of personal beef with Koil

[1:45:20] Elmatron97: The "loser" can be the best content
[1:45:20] MrConfound: Rp is never about winning and losing. It is all about giving and taking.
[1:45:21] thewookie34: The only part of PD RP I dislike is footchases where it feels like you easily catch the bad guy but the mechinacs of GTA stopped you
[1:45:22] complexlalo: Good rp is getting both Ws and Ls but in the end everyone chased the W both sides
[1:45:23] slymox: @The_YellowMist He was removed from Whitelist because he owns part of another server that is currently filing suit against Koil.
[1:45:24] Lofty916: Wrangler refused to lose

[1:45:36] satchburnear: i support the long dick of the law
[1:45:37] FaramirRat: I thought the Wrangler Dynamic was great, people were actually afraid when they got pulled over by him or saw him when they were doing some crime. I remember Buddah and them lighting his ass up at the Casino they were so afraid of him.,
[1:45:38] SpaceCowboy94: Someone's gotta make losing cool

[1:45:45] suulxo: slay pixel golden hour
[1:45:45] guilt_: streaming nopixel strikes me like what would happen if people were allowed to comment on a tv show while it was being made - if people don't like the plot is going, they'll whine
[1:45:45] Grilbur: I think this chat is very middle ground
[1:45:45] disposable0219: dying sucks even if its rp it feels bad
[1:45:46] Poorly_Made: Remember when Moon did Lenny the cop.... he was hilarious
[1:45:47] TheBrinern: @slymox he lost whitelist because koil compared him to Rated and Penta responded back
[1:45:49] Shmoopee: you say this every night!
[1:45:55] TheKingOfWit: being boring and not entertaining can be 'good' RP. your character might be boring
[1:45:55] StreamElements: https://gamersupps.gg/otk Use code “OTK” for 10% your purchase!
[1:45:56] ChaoticSanity: just like you said there has to be pros and cons and thats what the Ws and the Ls are @EsfandTV

[1:46:08] wavy__________________: Squid1 Squid3 Squid4
[1:46:10] Utschig: idk how it is these days but going to prison back in the day could honestly be considered "losing" the gameplay/content was dead there most of the time
[1:46:11] slymox: @TheBrinern That probably also happened
[1:46:15] NSAne93: Wrangler was 3.0s version of Trooper Eli from the group before No Pixel
[1:46:17] satchburnear: the LSPD is pretty soft ngl
[1:46:27] KappaManJason: did you ever get that warrant signed?
[1:46:28] judge_hat: it felt like half of the time young dab was in jail
[1:46:28] DirtyQ505: Kill shots only
[1:46:35] St0rmyPl4ys: Ruth has everyone scared to use their firearms
[1:46:35] guilt_: @Grilbur a decent amount of chat are likely a little bit older and realize not to take the shit so seriously
[1:46:44] ohma330: ITS BC THEY DEFUNDED THE POLICE BRUTHER hasChud

[1:46:56] tokeyredeye420: Viewers get more hurt by streamers taking a L than the streamers do taking Ls
[1:47:05] LoxKR: one of pentas main issues was that he would keep people in cells processing them for sooo long, it wasn't uncommon to be stuck in a cell for an hour+
[1:47:05] Sweet_BabyJeebus: yeah but just get a DAP then
[1:47:05] DeeterDo: wait Cornwood doesnt have a fire arm??????

[1:47:08] Gachiguru: SOPs did say shoot
[1:47:08] satchburnear: the rules of engagement should be re worked to get some pew pew goin
[1:47:08] sincebeforetheinternet: All I know is the clown kidnapping game was like a diehard scenario and cornwood came out on top no gun needed!
[1:47:10] belgianswaffel: when with 2 one should tase and the other nightstick them
[1:47:10] Kaztiell: @St0rmyPl4ys Ruth only go against ppl who dont follow sops, if cops knew their sops they would be scared to use their guns
[1:47:17] Gachiguru: the chat hoppers dont know that LULE
[1:47:18] DMCknight: I think cornwood as a character works way better as a sheriff and a little more solo
[1:47:19] wavy__________________: Can't Cornwood put in the report that he is neutered through SOPs?
[1:47:19] sorsby_: baddies getting away from every chase is just bad for everyone, cant wait for the buffs

[5:35:25] Alphaj290: the state of being caught in or as in a trap: "the feeling of entrapment grows as the roads close and the power goes out" · "nerve entrapment often occurs in throwing sports" the action of tricking someone into committing a crime in order to secure their prosecution: "his style of investigation constitutes entrapment"
[5:35:28] chrjens: you told him to run over there tho :)
[5:35:29] joeneter: ooooh right
[5:35:30] KnightyGaming: cgunneSpy
[5:35:35] Vengy: Entrapment = Terrorism same thing as jaywalking.
[5:35:37] supaiiii: Dub_D noone told him to not use the pedestrian crossing
[5:35:37] GregaryLuks: lead, tell, encourage
[5:35:40] Squid1030: speed trap is not entrapment. However, they are akin to entrapment.
[5:35:41] ObiJUANcannoliii: entrapment is when a cop makes a person do a crime they wouldnt otherwise do
[5:35:41] doctamoose: That's what you are doing
[5:35:42] JamboBrenn: so creating the conditions doesnt count? just telling them to
[5:35:42] Dman423: @joeneter no, it would be like giving someone weed saying it’s legal, then arrest them for possession.

[5:35:44] KnightyGaming: MadgeRightNow
[5:35:44] 13nox__: he said to run to the courhouse, and to not do crime
[5:35:45] BoogieAnimal: Entrapment is defined as a situation in which a normally law-abiding individual is induced into committing a criminal act they otherwise would not have committed because of overbearing harassment, fraud, flattery or threats made by an official police source.
[5:35:47] jacksmithcje: just cos he said go over or run over its still up to him to cross it safely

[5:35:49] Freestar25: Yea you told him to run across the street
[5:35:49] TheyCallMePoki: 8t is technically entrapment because you anticipated him jaywalking and did not advise him otherwise
[5:35:49] sterred: @chrjens he didnt tell him NOT to use a crossing tho
[5:35:49] Leafyerick: @chrjens He told him to go to city hall and didn't tell him not to use a crosswalk
[5:35:51] GorSTL: how the fuck does everyone keep confusing that lol

[5:36:23] BoogieAnimal: ya its not the guy could have used the crosswalk but he chose not to
[5:36:23] dodecapus: isn't jaywalking only jaywalking if it is done unsafely?  like if there is no one coming, it is not jaywalking
[5:36:26] AbeFroman2: he isnt making them break the law
[5:36:27] RerQ: @sleepy_beagle no, they aren't telling them to do the crimes
[5:36:27] kreloril777: so just being a dick cop
[5:36:28] ebert42: you did say just run over there quick
[5:36:31] ConstyUK: Challenging someone to a race off the lights, then booking them would be entrapment
[5:36:31] Leafyerick: @kaaaanner He effectively didn't
[5:36:35] Lord__Gen: Go stand by the crosswalk, help the bro out

[12:39:18] cjohno20: I think the goal in 4.0 is to balance by adjusting consequences to crimes in the form of reputation hits and fines, etc. Instead of buffing/nerfing cars, cuffs, tasers @EsfandTV
[12:39:23] EvilCoatrack: I feel like they're trying to make civilian work early on more profitable than crime, which I like.  And then people get forced into crime

[12:39:36] azmer1987: @minich4rmander no. They arent allowed. There cars are basically the worst car in the city x5
[12:39:39] EPiQ: RP isn't about being a balanced competitive game. There's tons of RP trying to become competitive "in-fiction"
[12:39:41] sp0rkehNW: It always is on reset, til they hammer out actual crime, then it should balance out @EsfandTV
[12:39:42] Antidomeitic: I like the Crim doesn't pay out crazy well at least with cops being weak
