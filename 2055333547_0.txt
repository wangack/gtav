[4:19:54] Servv_: @xKoomer he did it offline bc of rp chatters and meta chatters, and to build a big story and make rp for alot of people bc its been stale in 4.0 so far
[4:19:54] RyliksBlackwell1: Or said he wanted to lose shot everybody ocean dump them and then Rob the house
[4:19:56] CaptainPriz3: If x stayed, the company would have been the group to have the gun bp and do the first robberies.
[4:19:58] enkacang: lysNoShot

[4:20:00] KTtheGhost: when ray comes on and hears the news he'll be so happy and it will be good content
[4:20:04] SkarredBlue: you can create something out of nothing in RP, thats the whole point of RP, therefore anything can be content, so true
[4:20:04] NotJavier69: mhm 󠀀
[4:20:05] 11_cliff: Offline raiding then proceed to stream the next day started streaming laughing for 2mins, then karma hits he malds KEKW
[4:20:07] karrotrp: mhm
[4:20:08] Eraser_3: Offline raiding is poor content

[4:20:47] Z3KL: chat hoppers would’ve killed the raid
[4:20:48] 234yh: lets be real if he didnt do it offline everybodys chat would be flooded with meta
[4:20:53] CaleJTT: pussy move imo
[4:20:54] lively021: Would you still ask X for a selfie in real life

[4:21:00] NotJavier69: LickYou
[4:21:00] JerryOH: yeah same
[4:21:01] riftshadow: If he had waited one day, he could have yonked the gun blueprint, and it would have been crazier... it was kind of lucky for the company. He did it when he did it.
