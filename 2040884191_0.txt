[14:36:07] WilliamBoshi: is it skill based or more random the fights in gta ?
[14:37:01] Weejeebird: both. but also ped models like 4t don't hit as hard as custom models.
[14:37:34] WilliamBoshi: really ? ooh
[14:37:42] forever_eber: birb do you have palworld?
[14:37:55] Weejeebird: oh god crystImfine

[14:38:19] forever_eber: detuneEyesa
[14:38:40] Weejeebird: uhhh. im not sure lmao. that's usually developer stuff
[14:38:52] WilliamBoshi: you meant like fighitng model or character model ?
[14:40:01] Weejeebird: character model. like, since swan is built from the ground up, her dmg per hit is normal. 4t, whose model was an NPC in the original game, hits so much softer than a custom one

[14:42:39] Shiny_Alakazam: crystLUL
[14:42:40] WilliamBoshi: I saw carmen do a bit of 3D modelling too I assume it's for gta
[14:42:57] Weejeebird: nopixel devs usually vet what gets put into the server so yeah, kevin is right crystOk

[18:59:58] forever_eber: what swan and ginger had a what?
[19:00:05] lazyyguy: @pronprimel i think so too, the most outstanding will get very close to the board and others will be full-fletched members of the company
[19:00:09] eiyzen: 😂 being x's intern would be crazy
