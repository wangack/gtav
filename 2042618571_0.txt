[5:09:15] re_quake: how many daps does cornwood have now
[5:09:18] Geralt_De_Rivia: READING = Bedge

[7:35:32] Ned15: HmmCouncil
[7:35:37] allenog03: thats why lasers to a airplane are highly illegal, lights at all do blind pilots Hmmm
[7:35:39] Ned15: that's not good LuL
[7:36:09] Doqx42: test chasing through the grass and see if the 88 turbo spins out to much
[7:36:12] xsilas43: cozney KEKW
[7:36:18] SmugPls: OMEGALUL
[7:37:07] BakinPacman: the bigger turbo can help with the wheel spin too though
[7:37:24] BakinPacman: its just testing
[7:38:05] BakinPacman: point to point testing could be a good idea
[7:38:15] BakinPacman: go x distance then u turn and repeat

[7:38:41] Kevz95: 7-8 hours ago, either right before or after slacks went on duty
[7:38:49] xTurqeh: i think it was when there were like 2 10-80s happening AND all the captains where meeting bc that was right around 5pm
[7:39:01] Agentdolly: Isn't Snr buns a government building LUL
[7:39:25] Lanterno: it was during the meeting with captains and while there was some chases and arrests going on
[7:39:25] Agentdolly: State run and all.
[7:39:27] NilfgaardianSlave: Yeah, idk how trespassing works with state owned businesses
[7:39:56] cjohno20: you should authorize snr buns managers to detain and cuff violent suspects on the premises KEKW
[7:40:06] FinexLive: alooo
[7:40:15] FinexLive: get a 97
[7:40:40] dakota22446: saabOwo
[7:40:59] Agentdolly: Nah the handling is Shit
[7:41:01] Xarisher: I mean cops are supposed to be OP in a way
[7:41:03] BakinPacman: i feel like you need some thing between the two
[7:41:05] Kevz95: 89 is only gonna be OP on highways
[7:41:06] Rare__Potato: I mean, have you seen some of the cars PD are chasing? OMEGALAUGHING
[7:41:07] Drkdream: hmm it might perform different during a chase
[7:41:07] cjohno20: crims would kill for this acceleration
[7:41:09] JEV0: the handling is gona mess you up
[7:41:11] SimplyOrt: i think cvpi's need a big ole v8 lmao
[7:41:22] Darkri19: you are also doing this on damaged cars so have to consider how good they will be when repaired
[7:41:23] psicosmoker1979: too much for vinewood
[7:41:33] mcstanky_steven: handling seems worse the bigger the turbo
[7:41:48] xsilas43: 59 seems like the play for all the tight corners
[7:41:51] BakinPacman: the bigger turbo stops the wheel spin at lower speed
[7:41:55] Rare__Potato: I know what they need wideCatStare
[7:41:59] xTurqeh: you just smoked him 0-60 though
[7:41:59] ImGenX: @Ssaab Most of the city cars are slow, don't need over kill speeds.
[7:42:05] StreamElements: Follow me on tiktok for stream highlights! https://www.tiktok.com/@ssaabster
[7:42:07] octagonner: in a few weeks you will deal with much better cars
[7:42:32] Veixa: 89mm for a small CV engine will take ages to spool and have a huge turbo lag
[7:42:34] BakinPacman: you can spin your wheels 1-60 faster but maintaining traction is key
[7:42:36] Rare__Potato: Fingle WideSusge
[7:42:37] Xarisher: Yeah no 100% 88s
[7:42:40] xTurqeh: fingle dan
[7:42:41] Drkdream: HUH
[7:42:49] cjohno20: I think cop cars should be just good enough to slowly catch up to most cars on a straight
[7:42:51] Artsii1994: Local fingle
[7:42:54] FinexLive: WHAT
[7:42:57] Antaunik: I would think a mix would be best so you can keep up on either the highway or make turns in the city
[7:43:06] sspungg: if u have to bust a u turn this car is perfect
[7:43:12] criquetRL: remember guys, Saabingle Dan this Saturday COPIUM
[7:43:13] msnzonegamingadvocate: how about a mix of them in the fleet
[7:43:31] sspungg: I think the intercepted needs the small one an everything be good
[7:43:34] msnzonegamingadvocate: doesnt have to be all one or the other
[7:43:40] killaton: but cornwood cant drive
[7:43:42] ummjupie: o7 interceptor
[7:43:46] Drkdream: it might perform a bit different specially with all the turns during a real chase
[7:43:47] Xarisher: That braking is crazy
[7:44:01] praetorianalpha: OP
[7:44:06] ImOome: looks 10x better
[7:44:11] cjohno20: it drives better than almost every non-chopping car I've seen
[7:44:13] FinexLive: @Ssaab why do they say the turbo number should be the speed it activate is it in the description or something?
[7:44:14] xTurqeh: i think the 89 is a step below the interceptor but also a large step above the 540
[7:44:15] Count_Brennuvarg: and it'll still get smoked by rental cars PepeLaugh
[7:44:20] Agentdolly: Yea somehow the turbo make the whole car better LUL
[7:44:21] sspungg: I think this car is perfect
[7:44:22] Sax850: breaking is something you really need, most moesley cars are fast but suck at breaking
[7:44:27] Lanterno: you should put it in the other car and see if it has to do with the vehicles themselves
[7:44:37] Lanterno: should flip flop
[7:45:11] sspungg: I think the intersepter needs a small one or the second one
[7:45:23] BakinPacman: need like a 69mm LUL
[7:45:38] FinexLive: HUH
[7:45:39] Xarisher: Nice
[7:45:45] PolygonStatic: nice
[7:45:53] M3disyn: HUH
[7:45:53] xTurqeh: 69 is nice
[7:45:54] Kevz95: KEKW
[7:46:02] bhudiekhal: bigger one also makes the car able to keep up when they goto highway to escape
[7:46:05] psicosmoker1979: 90 percent of the cars are 20 miles slow
[7:46:08] FinexLive: Hmmm it always is
[7:46:16] Kaelath_The_Red: wideHUH that ain't how a turbo works wut
[7:46:21] eqnjn: MM =/= MPH, it's just acceleration throughput, bigger really is better
[7:47:01] ImOome: damn flop got those lines down
[7:47:07] Kaelath_The_Red: Susge gonna log in and buy all the manual transmissions and sneak them into every cop car
[7:47:10] BakinPacman: cutting corners
[7:47:11] BakinPacman: LUL
[7:47:13] JimmyOppa: try a prius cop car Kappa
[7:47:15] DiscretionaI: Weather conditions may vary the study
[7:47:26] DiscretionaI: +1 PTB within RP
[7:47:29] Drkdream: yeah during turns you will suffer
[7:47:41] Drkdream: if you can go straight you make up for the turns
[7:47:47] Drkdream: so it balances it out kindof
[7:47:52] batperson: cutting corners
[7:47:58] Kevz95: so interceptors are better with handling and acceleration, but vapids with 89s have higher top speeds for highway chases.
[7:48:06] sspungg: I think it‚Äôs good your always in site i haven‚Äôt seen your car slip or spin once
[7:48:07] Drkdream: it might be strong for paralel pursuit tho
[7:48:33] M__Wolfe: Try this same test with the 50s
[7:48:37] catloyalist: Did they announce who got picked for Academy yet?
[7:48:46] M__Wolfe: 3 cars, 89, 50, and interceptor with the slalom test
[7:49:16] BakinPacman: they need to keep at atleast on straights
[7:49:24] BakinPacman: so just figure out the optimal max speed
[7:49:37] Kaelath_The_Red: WICKEDSTEER me being a cop owning a tricked out ZL1 1LE
[7:50:08] JEV0: moar power
[7:50:28] Xarisher: I honestly feel like 89 should be on interceptors, put 70s on vics
[7:50:35] Agentdolly: Yep 89 will turn into a Psuedo Interceptor..
[7:50:45] sspungg: I think the intersepter needs a small turbo
[7:50:53] Kaelath_The_Red: UHM But all the cars on screen are interceptors
[7:50:55] sspungg: an keep the turbo u got in yours
[7:51:11] xTurqeh: D66 got it
[7:51:20] dakota22446: sus elpers
[7:51:22] Xarisher: 69420 got it

[7:51:53] xTurqeh: KKona
[7:52:21] 5800x3d: Different on paper YAPPP Pursuit will be different YAPPP Taurus is better YAPPP
[7:52:25] PiiiNGOO: why not wait until city stops making changes to cvpi before setting turbo? not really fun to play with parameters when the base changes. @Ssaab
[7:52:35] Tarushaffxiv: i'm heading out night guys
[7:52:42] PiiiNGOO: Oh

[7:53:03] Kaelath_The_Red: NOTED PD can't drive
[7:53:20] autorocket: drive the smaller one to feel the difference yourself
[7:53:22] SimplyOrt: how about a smaller twin turbo setup in cvpi?
[7:53:27] dakota22446: PotFriend
[7:53:27] SimplyOrt: if thats an option
[7:53:31] autorocket: cornwood cant drive
[7:53:42] xTurqeh: ask flop about his truck on chilliad
[7:53:44] sspungg: I say if u put a small turbo on the intersepter would be good
[7:54:07] dakota22446: kkonaU put a jet engine on them
[7:54:55] sspungg: what turbo is in this car
[7:55:04] sspungg: or is there one in this car

[10:07:55] Eddie1225: listen
[10:08:01] ImOome: mistaken NODDERS
[10:08:02] Rockshock: Maybe cornwood got a different kind of fun in mind
[10:08:07] carparker76: each shift culture is very different
[10:08:08] Rockshock: I mean,It dependswhat the fun is
[10:08:09] Eddie1225: i dont hink cornwood knows how much leeway he actually has
[10:08:10] Eddie1225: OMEGALAUGHING
[10:08:11] Drkdream: I think it needs a little fun boost but yeah NODDERS
[10:08:16] xTurqeh: I think he wants ruth to bring some memes to the meeting like you o
[10:08:38] Nymsoft: I think he's worried folks are going to quick the game because the early shift is horrible, and folks already expressed wanting to skip it.
[10:08:39] Tuna_Chunks: Copy paste stabbing at snr buns
[10:08:42] Sandra_D: the shift 3 meeting is so different, maybe the other meeting needs some bits
[10:08:45] Artsii1994: Not everything has to be fun but just have it placed in there but not too loosely
[10:08:59] MothyNZ: Some officers are hovering in the background to sink other officers imho.

[10:09:14] Tuna_Chunks: KKona
[10:09:15] Luthercorpz: I don't think Corny is talking for or about himself. I feel like he's talking about everyone. Meetings are the best for PD  <3
[10:09:37] Drkdream: kkonaU
[10:09:50] ogspeacetv: @Luthercorpz part of me feels he misses the good ole days
[10:10:12] ogspeacetv: kkonaU
[10:10:18] buddha_hands: cornwood may be comparing right now with the nostalgia he feels from when he was last around, but the way to get to that point is very long+very difficult lol
[10:10:34] MothyNZ: @ogspeacetv I disagree, the good old days is what led cornwood to retire.
[10:10:41] Rockshock: Feel like the fun can easily go overboard though if not controlled right.
[10:10:57] Drkdream: I think its because shift 1 feels a bit more serious compared to the wild shift 2 KEKW
[10:11:05] ImOome: @buddha_hands nah, if you see the difference between the two meetings today you would get it.
[10:11:21] pranjal_kumar: chat what happened to the den situation i just woke up lol
[10:11:24] buddha_hands: which two @ImOome
[10:11:33] Rockshock: A lot of people find fun in seriousness when it comes to roleplay also. So it really deepnds to what extent of fun he's talking about
[10:11:35] ImOome: @buddha_hands The only two, both after the storm.
[10:11:47] Serakkis: @pranjal_kumar 2 DAPS, 24h suspension
[10:11:48] Artsii1994: Kkona @pranjal_kumar he got 24 hours and 2 daps
[10:12:04] pranjal_kumar: @artsii1994 suspension? o7
[10:12:13] buddha_hands: @ImOome the entire day has been meetings from this POV OMEGALUL
[10:12:14] Artsii1994: Yea
[10:12:20] pranjal_kumar: well he got saved atleast
[10:12:29] pranjal_kumar: tbh i thought it was going to be 1
[10:12:31] ImOome: @buddha_hands yeah you would have to watch other pov's to understand what cornwood is talking about.
[10:12:36] Drkdream: saabWiggle
[10:12:50] MothyNZ: Ruth is immediately combative or dismissive. hard for those not on her pet list to have frank discussion about officers she values.
[10:13:07] 8uky1: huge informations

[11:41:50] zac4e: Is that Dean Quincy hryLaf
[11:41:50] xGotNoClout: I think the DAPs are okay but 60 days until they are removed is a long time. 30 would be much better IMO

[11:42:19] Tuna_Chunks: i guess the dap system is more of a punishment tool, rather than a teaching tool KKona
[11:42:28] FluffyDK: got paid 30k, still refuses to pay mr. K the rent he's owed
[11:42:35] sti9_: True

[11:42:53] RYANizee: I agree cause now Denzel is one away for like 50 days üòÇ
[11:42:54] Artsii1994: @FluffyDK he did pay him through wire transfer the other day
[11:43:00] Belvai: i think theres only 3 peeps with over 1 dap?
[11:43:15] bnp_np: is ssaab alrealy folding with dap points lol been a good month i guess
[11:43:18] Eddie1225: yall need to stop with the

[11:43:38] Decimated_exo: ye why whole system is in question because of 2 officers?
[11:43:39] unshapeddiagram: I mean what happened to riding a desk? you could have them do reports. there‚Äôs plenty of options to lose daps
[11:43:40] xGotNoClout: @RJNoahh I think 3-5 of them are due to be removed in roughly 30 days
[11:43:45] uhSnow: I will never understand why viewers care more than the streamers LUL
[11:43:50] Eddie1225: @uhSnow always

[11:43:58] Rockshock: Watching people mad at Ruth is the funniest cause its' saod. Ruth mvp.
[11:44:00] meeto_tv: also getting 10 daps and getting fired can be good RP if you choose to make it good RP
[11:44:01] criquetRL: Shruge
[11:44:04] Decimated_exo: why 58 officers have no problem with the system and 2 are - system is the issue?
[11:44:13] Eddie1225: @meeto_tv bingo
[11:44:15] Eddie1225: but even then
[11:44:17] Frog69: whole event stemed from derolo ooc malding anyway

[11:44:24] Eddie1225: its a review OMEGALAUGHING
[11:44:27] Rockshock: System isnt the issue. Den is the issue. Getting 9 daps says a lot about the person

[11:44:43] flamingacegibbo: #justicefordenzel
[11:44:44] Sonicfear: The DAP works fine. The problem is perception, a few officers stack days up and word spreads. Leading to officers into the idea that they to can easily dapped and start checking themselves constantly.
[11:44:44] Artsii1994: rp is our life
[11:44:44] Eddie1225: mf gonna be on offstream OMEGALAUGHING

[11:45:15] Decimated_exo: @Frog69 classic chatter know who feels what ooc
[11:45:16] Chipset3: Is the DAP system actually fit for purpose, is it making officers learn from their mistakes?
[11:45:16] xGotNoClout: @Decimated_exo Don't get me wrong, Shiesty makes a lot of fuck ups that deserve DAPs. But he has also made lots of progress in regards to investigations that some should be removed for good work
[11:45:17] PuppetMa5teR: @Ara_Memnoch Ah ok, makes sense. Still sounds bad though lol
[11:45:18] energizergeyser: @Nurutooo dont compare
[11:45:19] rclemon_: what am i paying for UltraMad

[11:45:41] meeto_tv: @rclemon_ going back to netflix ReallyMad
[11:45:55] Rockshock: I think there need to be a better system of working away DAP's though. DAPs in itself is fine.
[11:45:58] energizergeyser: @Artsii1994 im sad i lost my vip badge Sadge
[11:46:06] uhSnow: like any punishment system it‚Äôll work as long as it‚Äôs consistent
[11:46:09] catloyalist: I think it punishes people who work longer hours worst than others.
[11:46:10] drypc96: Kappa
[11:46:16] ItchiNipl: I'm from the UK and Cornwood is the last thing I watch in the night and the first thing to get me ready for work :)

[11:46:22] Decimated_exo: @uhSnow Nodgers
[11:46:23] ip33fr331y: The dap system is like a bad idea in kindergarten.
[11:46:36] surelyURjokingMrFeynman: Cornwood is eternal
[11:46:57] DefunkdLimbic: Cornwood is awesome
[11:47:05] Mic_Stargazer: DAP points kinda feel like they stay too long, it seems scary af to get them lol
[11:47:23] xTurqeh: is frost ppo or officer?
[11:47:24] Sonicfear: I do believe the time it takes a dap to drop off, like it needs to halfed.
[11:47:25] flamingacegibbo: the dap system is good if it‚Äôs used fairly
[11:47:25] Frog69: @Decimated_exo rewatch the clip lol her voice is shaking
[11:47:29] aye_see: accountability and consistency are both important
[11:47:29] Rockshock: If people didnt get DAP PD would be a shitshow of shit RP
[11:47:32] xGotNoClout: @ItchiNipl Esfand no longer exists. His whole day is spent as Cornwood LUL
[11:47:39] uhSnow: @mic_stargazer isn‚Äôt it the same time as a criminal has to work off criminal charges?
[11:47:42] uhSnow: koilD
[11:47:45] criquetRL: @christiannnnnnnnn ppo, just made today
[11:47:45] Decimated_exo: @Frog69 touch grass :)
[11:47:50] ImOome: getting 3+ for one incident seems like alot
[11:47:53] Belvai: daps awarded so far  have been 100% avoidable
[11:47:58] catloyalist: I'm gonna keep asking. Has the new cadets been announced yet?
[11:48:03] TheRealTweex: Cornwood RPs as Esfand at this point
[11:48:06] ItchiNipl: @xGotNoClout Whos esfand, I don't know him
[11:48:07] moodymellow: Have you ever thought about making a in depth document with everything someone could do wrong and the punishment for it - that way every captain follows the same code ?
[11:48:12] crankyeggs: What officers have got daps?
[11:48:20] xTurqeh: @criquetRL gangPoggers
[11:48:24] xGotNoClout: @xGotNoClout Exactly LUL
[11:48:32] Sonicfear: 60 days for dap to drop is seriously to long.
[11:48:37] Chipset3: I suspect there's a risk that the Dap system will become very entrenched orthodoxy
[11:48:38] DefunkdLimbic: truth
[11:48:38] davidpeck_: United Kappa
[11:48:43] ogspeacetv: DAPfinitely DAP
[11:48:47] Mic_Stargazer: @uhSnow If you're a criminal having more charges really doesn't feel like much of a penalty, if you're a civ sure but not a crim

[11:49:28] meeto_tv: dogeSmile Sadge
[11:49:29] Rebsdorf_TFT: Ruth plays damn good, the dap system creates more chaos than good
[11:49:36] xGotNoClout: Ruth is great for RP. Her arc is designed to piss people off
[11:49:37] xTurqeh: that dog is DEAD
[11:49:39] Mic_Stargazer: You've got Slacks as the softy, ruth as the strict one and turner is super logical
[11:49:39] xTurqeh: D:
[11:49:43] Krimson07_: NODDERS
[11:49:44] Artsii1994: ruth is one of the best captains out there nobody may not agree with her takes shes still one damn good captain
[11:49:46] Eddie1225: NODDERS
[11:49:49] GhostPHD_: i love all the captains and everyone at the PD
[11:49:49] Chipset3: Nodders
[11:49:52] ip33fr331y: The dap thing really seems to run a risk of pushing away excellent officers.
[11:49:53] Artsii1994: and cheever is amazing at what she does
[11:49:55] moodymellow: Ruth being a hardass does a lot for RP - it's actually great
[11:50:00] Rockshock: Ruths character is great and her roleplay is great
[11:50:03] ip33fr331y: Double edged sword I guess
[11:50:04] Krimson07_: UltraMad aurora
[11:50:09] Hutkelm: hE l LO
[11:50:10] xTurqeh: @Artsii1994 facts, shes definitely top 3 for sure
[11:50:12] uhSnow: I‚Äôm a big fan of how Cheever plays Ruth. Feels like I‚Äôm talking to an actual Captain.
[11:50:14] surelyURjokingMrFeynman: when she misreports things is that deliberate? if so it's amazing RP
[11:50:17] Decimated_exo: wild rp cops being captains smh
[11:50:17] tim212_: if you don‚Äôt like getting daps they should think about doing their jobs properly and they wouldn‚Äôt get a dap
[11:50:19] flamingacegibbo: it comes across as she‚Äôs using them to push certain people she don‚Äôt like out the PD
[11:50:20] ogspeacetv: you rp'ed in wildrp too?
[11:50:25] Rebsdorf_TFT: yeah I feel like the dap system takes away a lot of moral
[11:50:28] Artsii1994: @ogspeacetv he has yes
[11:50:31] froogo0: How many Shiesty's and Cornwood's have to be piled up to that eventual confrontation!? PepeHands Only RP will tell.
[11:50:32] zac4e: NODDERS This whole situation has me more invested than GoT hryLaf
[11:50:35] foxweazel: @ip33fr331y if they were excellent officers, they wouldn't receive so many daps
[11:50:42] TheRealTweex: Ruth is meant to be power hungry. It is such a perfect role
[11:50:45] Belvai: i feel like all 3 captain cover 100% of running a police dept
[11:50:46] Decimated_exo: @ogspeacetv all 3 captains were in RDR2 Wild rp "law" system KEKW
[11:50:48] uhSnow: @flamingacegibbo that‚Äôs just morons assuming what they want to assume without getting actual facts.. super cringe
[11:50:52] Sonicfear: 60 days for an officer is 60 days. 60 days for a crim is 60 minutes, not the same.
[11:50:53] tim212_: @uhsnow 1000% but chatters will cry when their streamer gets a dap from doing dumb shit
[11:50:53] meeto_tv: as a new frog im sad i missed the reddead RP, that seems like it would be so good.
[11:50:54] lookingfornothinghere: DAP flop right now
[11:51:03] Krimson07_: ^
[11:51:03] StreamElements: What they said saabThat
[11:51:06] rclemon_: HEHE
[11:51:07] Artsii1994: the dap system is like a punishment but it makes you grow and reflect
[11:51:09] Silbullet: @ogspeacetv And I trained em on Wild xddwicked
[11:51:10] Rockshock: Wouldnt call Ruth power hungry, more a to the book serious Captain who takes her job seriously
[11:51:11] xGotNoClout: @zac4e I have been switching between rewatching GoT and RP LUL
[11:51:13] uhSnow: @tim212_ no one cares about pussy chatters though ya know
[11:51:20] AngelReborn_Official: Riuth is great. She is not one of the issues the PD is facing. PD got a handful problems which are not related to any roleplayer itself.
[11:51:22] Krimson07_: BasedGod snow
[11:51:27] PuppetMa5teR: Does PD have a reward system (besides promotion)
[11:51:28] Chipset3: It might be an issue with the application of the Dap system
[11:51:33] Eddie1225: you know whats funniest
[11:51:34] tim212_: @uhsnow oh 100%
[11:51:36] StreamElements: Don't forget to follow the stream if you are enjoying yourself!
[11:51:37] xTurqeh: maybe it wasnt meant to be Sadge
[11:51:40] Eddie1225: if all 3 captains didnt give any daps
[11:51:43] TheRealTweex: Turner is book serious Ruth is power hungry with the book serious
[11:51:45] Eddie1225: people would complain about that
[11:51:45] Eddie1225: OMEGALAUGHING
[11:51:52] RYANizee: is pushing that purgery charge on Denzel that was mentioned in the meeting a good idea because it‚Äôs kind of a weird one in my opinion
[11:51:54] uhSnow: true @eddie1225
[11:51:54] lookingfornothinghere: @uhSnow is it really still 60days for crime or did it go back to 30days i think ive heard cops mention 30days to charge
[11:51:55] ImOome: yep more problems are going to come because the character will be on edge
[11:51:56] Decimated_exo: oh for sure eddie
[11:52:00] Rockshock: PD's issue is more loose cannons doing dumb shit that earns them DAPs and then complain about the system rather than look at themselfs
[11:52:00] thewarth0g: 60 days a joke
[11:52:05] energizergeyser: eddie still being based as hell
[11:52:11] tim212_: if you have 9 daps after 30 days you should be fired
[11:52:16] Belvai: ruth is not power hungry at all
[11:52:17] ELEGlGGLE: why people mad in chat
[11:52:18] Decimated_exo: people would complain no mater what
[11:52:18] tim212_: @thewarth0g brother it‚Äôs the same as crims
[11:52:23] meeto_tv: the class RP is gonna be so good HEHE
[11:52:26] Ned15: @Eddie1225 People said Baas was a pushover now they want Slacks and the rest to be more lenient xddShrug
[11:52:27] DefunkdLimbic: doubt is bad
[11:52:29] tim212_: cops should be he‚Äôd to a higher standard therefore 60 is fair
[11:52:33] wildarrow88: That's fair
[11:52:35] AngelReborn_Official: @lookingfornothinghere What is the 30-60 days for criminal? I don't think I heard or am familiar with this system
[11:52:35] Eddie1225: @Ned15 its crazy OMEGALAUGHING
[11:52:37] uhSnow: @lookingfornothinghere it‚Äôs either 60 or 30.. I personally don‚Äôt care either way
[11:52:39] Rebsdorf_TFT: Sounds like a good direction
[11:52:45] jordanandersen5: You gonna run traffic?
[11:52:47] thewarth0g: crims go jail for 17 months and it lasts 17 mins
[11:52:49] Silbullet: @uhSnow For Statue of Limitations?
[11:52:49] Belvai: she dont want another downfall of the pd because of bad officers
[11:52:50] Mic_Stargazer: You can say it's the same as crims but what's the penalty to having something on your record as a crim vs a cop?
[11:52:52] ip33fr331y: flop needs a few dips before he can actually answer that question ;-)
[11:52:53] xGotNoClout: OMEGALUL No way DoneZel lasts 2 weeks without getting more than one DAP
[11:53:01] uhSnow: @silbullet yeah
[11:53:04] AnusReaktorMan: 45 lmao
[11:53:05] Silbullet: @uhSnow 30 Days
[11:53:06] BohLTss: Slacks <3
[11:53:10] Papercappu: Maybe abillity to remove if people did a good job
[11:53:13] Frog69: @Belvai but shes believing a lie sooooo
[11:53:19] BohLTss: Lions or 49ers?
[11:53:19] froogo0: Denzel's gonna be booking those classes OMEGALUL
[11:53:27] uhSnow: fair play, if crim statute is 30 then it would probably be good to match that
[11:53:27] Belvai: @Frog69 how so?
[11:53:40] Frog69: @Frog69 derolos report multiple lies
[11:53:48] drypc96: does bones have any Daps?
[11:54:05] ELEGlGGLE: why i wake up and see people mad? AINTNOWAY
[11:54:06] flamingacegibbo: if it carries on how it has been Denzel is gonna get fired and it‚Äôs a shame because he‚Äôs great at the RP and a good officer
[11:54:07] Mic_Stargazer: Like if you get a felony as a crim what do you? Keep doing crime. No real penalty. If you get one as a cop then you're inching closer to unemployment/suspension
[11:54:08] ip33fr331y: everybody should start with three Daps. Since there is a system where they can earn them off of it. And then everyone can feel that stress a little bit.
[11:54:08] tim212_: cops should be held to a higher standard then crims so 45-60 would make sense
[11:54:11] tim212_: yeah
[11:54:12] AngelReborn_Official: Do crims have any system like that? Where if they get cought x amount of times they are not allowed to do crime?
[11:54:13] Belvai: @Frog69 if you hadnt see other clips would you think the same?
[11:54:13] ImOome: 31 days then peepoGiggle
[11:54:16] xGotNoClout: @drypc96 Probably at least one from riding with Parmesan
[11:54:28] rclemon_: Do 31.1 days 5Head
[11:54:36] Krimson07_: cop rp should be the pinnacle of rp on a server hence they should be held to a much higher standard NODDERS
[11:54:37] thewarth0g: this is a video game tho and say shiesty gets sacked, will his viewers still want to watch his streams if hes no longer a cop?
[11:54:37] jordanandersen5: Talking about punishment and bad ethics is warranted to gossip which is a fireable offense
[11:54:37] lookingfornothinghere: i know Captains were talking about 45days but no waay to remove DAP or 60days and classes to lower DAP
[11:54:37] ELEGlGGLE: do 30.5 days 5Head
[11:54:39] Decimated_exo: @ELEGlGGLE ? you opened rp stream what else you fucking expect PepeLaugh
[11:54:43] Silbullet: I like the 60 cause as PD I feel like we should be held to a higher standard
[11:54:44] Frog69: @Frog69 yes, all the reports dont match up and witness statements a aligning with denzel+aziz
[11:54:50] Frog69: are*
[11:54:50] uhSnow: yeah I get that, makes sense
[11:54:55] Mic_Stargazer: @AngelReborn_Official that'd be interesting, too much "heat" around them to get jobs from the bosses
[11:55:00] Eddie1225: bruh
[11:55:01] tim212_: yeah 60 is that sweet spot
[11:55:03] Eddie1225: its 6am

[11:55:08] SmugPls: i think 45-60 makes sense from a like, higher than street level officer level. 30 for non command or like senior officers sounds fine?
[11:55:11] Eddie1225: drink some coffeee and stop being mad over a video game
[11:55:12] uhSnow: @frog69 go write a post about it who fucking cares bro

[11:55:53] moodymellow: Chats being weird
[11:56:04] Mic_Stargazer: @Mic_Stargazer that I've seen, no. thats why i say crim vs cop isnt comparable because no crim loses their "job"
[11:56:04] uhSnow: flop loves the past koilPff
[11:56:06] dr_halsey_: @moodymellow "thats my secret captain.... im always weird"
[11:56:07] Frog69: @Kasvar i think so kinda hard to keep up
[11:56:07] jordanandersen5: Hey @ssaab explain what a terry stop means
[11:56:07] ImGenX: Oh no, McNulty is going to make slacks quit. LUL
[11:56:10] Rockshock: Well, it's RP. You're ment to portray realism cash. Not be a silly twat fucking around
[11:56:16] TacticalFuzz: Maybe with daps if there was like a weekly review to see if they've improved with possibility of removing daps if they have?
[11:56:17] drypc96: deansoP
[11:56:21] invisibleTowel: "i hate to bring up the past" PepeLaugh
[11:56:30] uhSnow: @rockshock wrong, this server isn‚Äôt about realism at all LUL
[11:56:32] BobbyJ707: This guy sigh‚Äôs a lot lol
[11:56:41] AngelReborn_Official: @Mic_Stargazer Yeah. I always thought the biggest issue was cars and what cops are allowed to do, not the officers or Ruth itself :D
[11:56:44] ImOome: flops DonkBased
[11:56:45] Krimson07_: you can be a silly character but you should expect the consequences that come with it peepoShrug
[11:56:51] Eddie1225: ^
[11:56:51] StreamElements: What they said saabThat
[11:56:56] ELEGlGGLE: getting to know each other personal, people getting loose HUH
[11:56:58] flamingacegibbo: it feels like a lot of walking on egg shells atm in the PD
[11:56:58] uhSnow: role play is about escaping real life bullshit not pretending to live it LUL

[11:58:15] Mic_Stargazer: üñï
[11:58:18] Nymsoft: Tbh the only issue I have is the blatant lies, and the admited bias from a high command, and when people see it, call it, then get yelled at.

[11:58:19] invisibleTowel: D:

[11:58:35] lookingfornothinghere: did somebody get clapped by a local KEKW
[11:58:41] Th3Ch0: Does he know he still has notepad in hand

[11:58:57] Silbullet: @uhSnow Im in that same point. Its great having actual consequences to actions that feel weight
[11:58:58] Decimated_exo: @jordanandersen5 if police offiser has reasonable suspicion that crime was, is, will be committed AND he believes that person might be armed - they can first the person. Here you go
[11:59:06] StreamElements: Please do not meta in chat, which means do not tell Saab stuff happening in RP that his character would otherwise not know.
[11:59:06] uhSnow: makes sense yeah
[11:59:07] tim212_: @uhsnow exactly 3.0 people cried when cops had no punishments now cops have them they cry you  really can‚Äôt win

[12:00:25] uhSnow: I‚Äôm all over that shit
[12:00:26] tim212_: chatters be saying its a lie because you know the meta REMEMBER THE Captains don‚Äôt know that

[12:00:53] iBusu: ASS unit inc
[12:00:55] Krimson07_: SoyChamp air1 for this???
[12:00:57] Artsii1994: snow back in air one again FeelsStrongMan
[12:00:57] Serakkis: I wonder if the system would work better if one incident was a single DAP. Like you couldn't get 3,4 in one go. Keep it at 60 days, since it would require 10 separate incidences. Of course something -major- would be dealt with case by case.
[12:00:59] rubenx310: yea air is game changer
[12:01:01] marneraiders: But sadly no ASS1 LUL
[12:01:07] Serakkis: essaying

[12:01:17] uhSnow: will be a while before we actually need I assume
[12:01:17] moodymellow: @Ssaab What would be your perfect dap system if you could have if any way you wanted?
[12:01:38] Decimated_exo: @Serakkis if there are multiple fuck ups in one situation thats not a solution.
[12:01:38] tim212_: @serakkis do you understand a punishment system- every situation is different meaning more daps are needed
[12:01:49] Belvai: its like the pd think they know most of the crime going on when they dont even know 90% of whats going on
[12:02:12] Serakkis: @Serakkis yeah of course, kinda why I said something major. I don't think there is a clear cut solution
[12:02:16] Eddie1225: HmmCouncil
[12:02:22] uhSnow: @belvai that‚Äôs good for rp no?
[12:02:25] Decimated_exo: beat the suspect, charged them wrong charges, told your superior go to hell and was drunk on duty - oh all one situation - 1 DAP
