[2:15:43] Niktory: the customization in ravendawn is confusing me , so the archetype in the beginning is only for your looks right cause i could technically go shadow and then choose 3 different ones and look like a shadow ?

[3:50:20] FiniteResources: just saw an article that only 4% of the player population has fallen off
[3:50:22] FiniteResources: in 2 weeks
[3:50:23] IvyOlive: a bit repetitive
[3:50:35] FiniteResources: super low compared to like palworld
[3:50:38] The_Rossman: solo vs with friends is a huge factor
[3:50:50] bird24287: people are addicted to providing democracy Harry
[3:51:02] FiniteResources: yeah
[3:51:29] FiniteResources: 2/3 players quit playing palworld in 2 weeks LUL
[3:51:33] nutzzhunter: @finiteresources people finished the game, why keep playing?
[3:52:05] Sword_Scream: Helldivers also has something very few games lack. Gameplay against the devs. Joel really likes fucking with the players by making life hell for them
[3:52:33] Sword_Scream: If Palworld had come out 2 years ago, it'd not been nearly as big
[3:52:55] Sword_Scream: People love Palworld less than they hate Nintendo/Gamefreak
[3:53:02] nutzzhunter: @sword_scream why?
[3:53:10] Hogie48: Palworld will have its ups and downs though... its still early access and its PVE so its too hard to compare it to a lot of games
[3:53:21] Niktory: do you use your mouse a lot when you play ravendawn or not really
[3:53:24] Sword_Scream: @nutzzhunter Because at that point the disgust towards Gamefreak wasn't nearly as high as it is now
[3:54:02] Hogie48: I was thinking about rebinding my tab to a mouse button, havent checked if it is even possible yet
[3:54:06] TheWitchAtWoolworths: @Sword_Scream what happened with Gamefreak?
[3:54:45] nutzzhunter: @sword_scream you really think people play it because they mad at gamefreak? Its not hurting them in any way. I think the marketing of pokemon with guns did the trick
[3:54:48] MagnitudeGaming: chat what happened with the cypress spot for moonshine?
[3:54:58] Sword_Scream: @TheWitchAtWoolworths General sloppiness and laziness from their side. Every new pokemon game has been filled with more bugs and made easier for the player, but also still being incredible ass for competitive players
[3:55:08] MagnitudeGaming: oh i see
[3:55:09] Niktory: i wonder if i could program this game onto a controller OMEGALUL
[3:55:21] Sword_Scream: @nutzzhunter That isn't what I meant. I mean that if Gamefreak had made a proper pokemon game, less people would've cared about Palworld
[3:55:27] TheWitchAtWoolworths: @Sword_Scream ah gotcha
[3:55:44] Hogie48: "general disgust for gamefreak" is also like 1% of the playerbase btw... it makes essentially no difference in their sales
[3:55:47] nutzzhunter: @sword_scream still cant shoot guns in pokemon
[3:56:21] TheWitchAtWoolworths: How are things in the sewers, generally?
[3:56:24] Sword_Scream: @Hogie48 Pokemon will never hurt for sales, that's just a fact. The disgust is more from people who've played it for a long time, and will complain and cry but still buy it
[3:56:28] nutzzhunter: @sword_scream people keep buying the pokemon games instead of boycotting it. Nothing will change
[3:56:30] FiniteResources: i think generally people just heard there was a pokemon-style game that wasn't shit
[3:57:01] Hogie48: @Sword_Scream thats my point... who cares then?   Anyone complaining about something and still buying the product, while making reddit posts about how upset they are is literally free marketing
[3:57:08] Theburkeinator: TwitchConHYPE
[3:57:31] Sword_Scream: @nutzzhunter Gaming boycuts never work. They just don't. There's always enough casual fans who don't care
[3:57:41] KcsBack: jayzJAM
[3:57:42] TheWitchAtWoolworths: nice
[3:58:02] Hogie48: Yeah I started playing palworld becasue it was the "pokemon like game for PC" lol.   I hadn't played a pokemon since red/blue because I dont own a console or hand held
[3:58:49] Sword_Scream: @Hogie48 Don't get me wrong, Palworld would always have a market, but it wouldn't be as big as it got if it hadn't been for GameFreak being incredibly lazy with Pokemon games
[3:58:53] Theburkeinator: DansGame

[4:02:46] shamelessuncle25: downloaded Ravendawn, kinda scuffed i love it
[4:03:19] Sword_Scream: Omnimon/Omegamon was like... He was kinda the "Mewtwo" of the original gen. THE legendary/end game Digimon

[4:52:25] CuppaT_XYZ: lol
[4:53:03] CuppaT_XYZ: Hmm i not got alot of space on my main harddrive and it didn't ask me where to install, its taking a while to download so im thinking atleast a couple gig
[4:53:17] CuppaT_XYZ: wtf
[4:53:20] Hogie48: Yeah add/remove shows 76mb
[4:53:21] CuppaT_XYZ: aintnoway
[4:53:27] CuppaT_XYZ: thats the installer for the launcher
[4:53:55] dizzykoopa_: could be roaming for a weird reason
[4:54:13] Hogie48: It installs in "C:\Program Files (x86)\Tavernlight Games\Ravendawn" and that is 76mb.    Add/Remove does show 76.5mb though
[4:54:17] CuppaT_XYZ: C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\AppData\Local\Programs\Tavernlight Games
[4:54:25] CuppaT_XYZ: my internet shit though

[4:54:38] CuppaT_XYZ: thanks hogie
[4:55:28] CuppaT_XYZ: d3dSus that folder is saying 76mb for me too, kinda sus
[4:55:33] Zechss_: this guy
[4:55:45] Mugenshippai: Total for the game should be around 3gb after its downloaded all the updates and such I think
[4:55:54] Mugenshippai: basically you guys are looking at the client size not the game size
[4:55:58] Hogie48: no "Programs" in my appdata
[4:56:15] Hogie48: wait i lied
[4:56:19] CuppaT_XYZ: @Mugenshippai monkaHmm well where does it download to then, i like to know this info
[4:56:55] Hogie48: nah nvm, its not in there.
[4:57:10] CuppaT_XYZ: @Hogie48 did you install for all users?
[4:57:41] Hogie48: C:\Program Files (x86)\Tavernlight Games\Ravendawn Is where it installs for me
[4:57:49] Hogie48: No option for users on the installer
[4:57:58] Hogie48: But i will say... on first startup there was a downloading files thing
[4:58:32] CuppaT_XYZ: if that folder is saying 76mb its not where all the file is
[4:58:35] Hogie48: Yeah honestly I think it is.   Its 2d and models are all like 8bit
[4:58:40] CuppaT_XYZ: its can't be THAT tiny
[4:58:50] CuppaT_XYZ: because the download is taaking its sweet ass time
[4:58:52] Hogie48: Yeah I agree its hard to believe... ill look around
[4:59:15] Mugenshippai: @CuppaT_XYZ should have it all under ravendawn in appdata
[4:59:24] dizzykoopa_: how much is not a lot of space on the drive
[4:59:30] Hogie48: im scanning my hard drive with SpaceMonger to look for it lol

[6:15:48] tannu_tuva: ive been on twitch for years and still don‚Äôt know what lurk mode is
[6:15:48] searlesbarkleyk: Opinions on smash burgers? Lol
[6:15:49] tylynx: Don't Tax me bro!
[6:16:10] Aynumi: mod not here for scamba
[6:16:15] Sl33pyJinn: is lurking just having your stream on the second monitor ?
[6:16:19] IvyOlive: how much was it for keys to the new house?
[6:16:23] juggalo420: With I'm chilling watching Harry and Harry getting paid why do I have to chat
[6:16:26] LurkersUnion420: don't make us go on strike.

[6:16:53] IvyOlive: I‚Äôll help you mod I‚Äôm here all day
[6:16:54] rock99rock: So it cost $250,000 channel points to enable lurker tax.  When it goes off, all the lurkers contribute 1,100 channel points to let him know that even though they are not participating, they're still watching.
[6:17:02] Mugenshippai: cant tax us when its Harry getting us addicted to Ravendawn. No time to write in chat Kappa
[6:17:21] rock99rock: It just lets lurkers engage when they don't need or don't normally engage
[6:17:30] reskeezy: tax is theft, even lurker tax
[6:18:06] Sl33pyJinn: 90% of viewers are lurkers

[6:19:42] Aynumi: we usually jamming or chilling
[6:20:01] Mugenshippai: lurker tax makes no sense. the point of lurking for a lot of people is to get to relax and just enjoy a stream without engaging? all of a sudden there is a gonna be a system to force lurkers to engage? what?
[6:20:22] searlesbarkleyk: It's up to the lurkers it's not forced
[6:20:22] dumpster_diner: @teanmuffins where yo cousin vodkantonic harrSip
