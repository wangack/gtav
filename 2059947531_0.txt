[4:27:52] RSMatticus: @huge_a_hole hire jordan steele as you're lawyer
[4:28:42] illumoxx: would Burtons only argument be he didn't do it with malice or intent to mislead?
[4:28:43] mpk5150: they have to show intent to lie. burton has to prove there was no intent
[4:28:53] xxpops: ya one year cop cd if get caught purgury

[4:30:12] xxpops: oh fuck why didnt they read him miranda during that office visit
[4:30:16] Auxelian: GOOGIE??
[4:30:18] poppa_willy: Well just put him on the stand again and ask him if they talked on the phone about it

[4:30:42] AskMeAboutL00M: LETSGOPOLICE
[4:30:49] Uthemon: my question is, how many times can a police officer accidentally lie on the stand before its regarded as perjury
[4:30:50] BadHabitss: @xxpops ?? blooms whole meeting is about in-house shit, hes leaving the charges up to the DA's discretion
[4:30:50] poppa_willy: @RSMatticus jesus. i forgot he swore on the Blood God
[4:30:53] Explorer_ini: Thin purple Line ))
[4:30:54] flogbishop: LUL yep
[4:30:54] AzureMarquis: Same with Wrangler

[4:31:11] MrWhiskeyRichard: Yes
[4:31:14] chaospiper322: yes
[4:31:15] AzureMarquis: I 100% think he should've
[4:31:17] negrettsky: Yes
[4:31:22] sterowentUS: yeah, this is why the AG is often an opponent to the PD
[4:31:25] RSMatticus: there is levels of backing the blue, but prujury is a tough sell
[4:31:29] CaptenArc: LUL Chatters forget the human element
[4:31:30] arthurstorm_: Moose fighting 80s and the lot last night and hitting them with his car. So funny.
[4:31:31] Seriphax: Chatters don't like nuance
[4:31:34] AzureMarquis: it's about setting a tone
[4:31:38] Drivont: sometimes people don't want to press charges
[4:31:45] negrettsky: Back your police officers NODDERS
[4:31:52] GxdzR6: they need intent
[4:31:58] libylol123: roleplay i hate it *pukes*
[4:32:00] AzureMarquis: But then again this feels like it needs Blooms side also
[4:32:03] Stefffy01: roleplay on a roleplay server WHAT
[4:32:16] js1994_: thats a name i havent heard in a while
[4:32:18] DromiTM: backing perjury just undermines the entire doj too not only the cops
[4:32:19] dazzaisreal: ))

[4:32:50] AzureMarquis: Spontaneous utterance happens
[4:32:52] ToastedRubber: You can never prove intent with perjury. The person can always just say oopsie.
[4:32:54] broken665: Is intent considered?
[4:32:54] sterowentUS: if burton intended to mislead the facts of the case, then it's perjury. if he can give doubt of intention, it's not perjury
[4:32:55] MuddaMoose: honestly i like burton and hope he is not guilty
[4:32:58] mpk5150: nope
[4:33:01] Explorer_ini: @azuremarquis the good Azure pogg
[4:33:02] ModeledForYou: he doesn't know PEPW

[4:33:27] Drivont: I don't think ONX doesn't have Garrity (yet)
[4:33:28] PattyIce3: what about spontaneous utterance if Burton brought it up himself
[4:33:30] mpk5150: he should walk
[4:33:34] Mad_ManTV: Bob arguing with his inner demons
[4:33:35] poppa_willy: Yea but they could just charge him and put him on the stand
[4:33:40] dazzaisreal: PEPW metagaming frog
[4:33:42] EezeeG: He should still be fired if he admitted it but cannot be prosecuted though
[4:33:44] pillywix: i mean a guy who actually perjurs, doesn't approach a superior and tell them with an open heart, he didn't have to
[4:33:48] BadHabitss: I also think chat is conflating charging him with perjury and the PD's punishment regardless of what he's charged with
[4:33:54] RSMatticus: then he can peal the 5th
[4:33:56] RememberMyN4me: is the miranda rights established yet in RP though
[4:34:03] sirfatderick72: didn‚Äôt the judges already say Miranda doesn‚Äôt matter
[4:34:06] Kemli: Yea last I heard there was no garrity but Ive seen instances thsat question Miranda
[4:34:06] AzureMarquis: also yeah Miranda rights are an SOP

[4:34:16] Suboptimal: is a phone call considered an interrogation?
[4:34:17] poppa_willy: think he will lie again if they put him on the stand? PEPW
[4:34:21] mpk5150: they can charge him but they cant use the meeting they had
[4:34:22] Kemli: Ok
[4:34:27] ToastedRubber: Miranda is not required legally.
[4:34:30] AyBro__: doesnt PD use the major case laws like Arizona V Miranda
[4:34:32] thievezy: isnt miranda just to remind them of their rights, cant it be argued that since he's a cop he'd already know them
[4:34:35] Rinkimah: Wait who is this about? I've been in and out
[4:34:40] friggarn: they have to find proof he knew he was lying while on the stand.
[4:34:40] AskMeAboutL00M: this is gonna be interesting for setting precedent at least
[4:34:41] tlv2020: @poppa_willy He‚Äôll just do the classic ‚ÄúI do not recall‚Äù.
[4:34:42] RSMatticus: you can't mess up the the investigation of such a serious crime
[4:34:43] Kemli: Yea
[4:34:45] Nakedarmadillo: just say it was a mistake and youre good EZ
[4:34:46] AzureMarquis: No Brady violations
[4:34:47] js1994_: @Rinkimah Burton
[4:34:50] AzureMarquis: or Garity Warnings
[4:34:56] poppa_willy: @aleks shouldn't he be banned since he swore on p_dandy?
[4:35:01] Rinkimah: @js1994_ Jack Burton!?! Oh no!
[4:35:01] EezeeG: You are assuming a lot about how it happened right now though
[4:35:04] Explorer_ini: PEPW
[4:35:10] Dutch_Tuchd: When one witness states on the stand that a completely different series of events happened compared to every other witness and the Judge decides that the statements of that one witness are false or attempting to mislead that would be a provable perjury right? Because that's the case with the perjury in the Steele case.

[4:37:33] Kemli: I did Sadge
[4:37:48] Mad_ManTV: Damn it, i was late for meat
[4:38:04] AyBro__: Do cops transport someone who is detained to meet their lawyer at a department if they request a lawyer?
[4:38:04] carpoolkamikaze: @Mad_ManTV meat is forever
[4:38:06] Rinkimah: @poppa_willy Imagine needing meat to be explained to you KEKW
[4:38:20] Kemli: Nah @aybro__
[4:38:33] RSMatticus: @AyBro__ I don't believe you can transport someone who is detained
[4:38:46] RSMatticus: but even joy said he needed more time to think about it
[4:38:47] AyBro__: @Kemli so if I'm detained and being questioned on a traffic stop but I want a lawyer present, what happens then?
[4:38:53] Rinkimah: @RSMatticus Usually you would call your lawyer to come to you IIRC
[4:38:57] sterowentUS: this is so conflicting. bloom's want to clean up the PD is great, but burton's work is often exemplary with some stains.
[4:39:34] Kemli: @aybro__ in game from what ive seen, not arrested = no need for a lawyer
[4:39:52] Samuraiyeti: yup
[4:40:31] AyBro__: @Kemli ehh but if you're detained that means the cops have the RS and they're searching for that PC. You could potentially incriminate yourself without the guidance of a lawyer.. I just don't know if a lawyer would normally come to a traffic stop or how that works.
[4:40:48] Kemli: @aybro__ if detained and just refusing to comply then theyd be looking at acharge depending on the situation or just be cut loose depending on the scene
