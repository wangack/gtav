[4:41:50] Nightbot: Lalla_007 Backseat gaming is when you tell Nora what to do in game, (ex: call _____, run, shoot, you need_____). Excessive backseat gaming may result in a timeout or ban without warning. Thank you. noraexGun

[4:41:52] Nightbot: Lalla_007 Do not share in-game information regarding other players/content creators. Nora doesn't want to know and this can instead harm in-game decisions. This may result to a time out or ban without warning. (Meta-gaming is when you tell Nora what a different streamer is doing on the same server) Thank you. noraexPog
