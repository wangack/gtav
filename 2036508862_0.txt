[0:43:23] mostly_minerals: *ya know* in richard voice
[0:43:28] eddieatthegov: @doc_sharon and the bettor is sort of outside the game, with a "ghost" as banker and player in this case.
[0:43:31] Cbake987: No strat, pick banker or player and sit back and watch
[0:43:31] mysteryhoody: This is a lot to process but sounds interesting
[0:43:31] miliitrcz: this is too much for my brain rn nikezStop
[0:43:36] Insaif: Looks that way. Maybe some strat in drawing after the start if no one gets a "natural"?
[0:43:36] the_dude88: these are the tables at the casino that get SUPER LOUD but yeah it's just a guess LUL
[0:43:37] arbucklezero: Basically all chance.  Banker has a slightly higher chance of winning but plays slightly less
[0:43:41] if0rg0t2remember: I think you can kinda predict cards like in blackjack but thats about it
[0:43:46] zonerover: Gambling strat. But otherwise all chance
[0:43:47] MarinoV1: you're picking which side you think will win (or a tie), so yeah it's mostly chance.
[0:43:47] rustenskurk: Do you get to see one of the rolls before placing your bets?
[0:43:48] doc_sharon: tie is very low odds
[0:43:49] arbucklezero: It's basically betting on coin flips
[0:43:49] rickbuh: same number
[0:43:50] itGlenn: if they have the same amount
[0:43:57] Mirkoz__: is roulette available? katesGiggle
[0:43:58] Insaif: I think the tie is literally that: if the player and banker have the same total.
[0:44:01] mrpotter_nz: tie pays 8:1, the key is to low get the tie at the right time to try win big
[0:44:07] the_dude88: does a tie have to be 14 and 14 or can it be 14 and 4?
[0:44:17] doc_sharon: easiest is to just guess player or banker, but it pays out less
[0:44:24] mostly_minerals: katesSnug  number asmr
[0:44:26] minusxero: @the_dude88 14 is 4, as long as the final number is the same it's a tie
[0:44:30] BearClawPhD: so much math
[0:44:33] Insaif: @the_dude88 I think 14 and 4 are effectively the same as you drop the tens place.
[0:44:35] AshuraX13: Maths
[0:44:35] doc_sharon: he will do the math for you at least
[0:44:42] the_dude88: awesome that's what i'd guess but ya never know LUL

[0:44:50] Nightbot: Follow Kate on Instagram! instagram.com/kate.ttv
[0:45:04] mrpotter_nz: bet player or banker, then every now and then add a low bet to tie as well, it’s all chance

[0:45:28] Coolcise: ahhh
[0:45:29] MarinoV1: @Coolcise you pick which result it be (who wins), then he draws cards
[0:45:29] Drinnar: The choice is the bet. The cards are all dealt by a set of rules

[1:40:09] IchibaToll: Now I'm curious what the difference seemed to be between the later "fine" conversation and the earlier "catastrophic" conversation.  Great if it's actually squashed though.

[6:59:20] Insaif: @doc_sharon Yeah, I know. Just hadn't realized that was his actual name and it was literally just Joker split apart.
[6:59:27] TheRealZed11: you’d think with the hood missing, it would cool better.
[6:59:33] doc_sharon: gotcha
[6:59:35] Siirika: Wasnt Bobby with Carmine when V and Nick went to check out the LS apartments and they tried to put them in the fireplace? or was that someone else?

[7:00:33] doc_sharon: katesJam katesJam katesJam
[7:00:35] AshuraX13: katesJAM
[7:00:40] TheRealZed11: it’s electric. there shouldn’t be engine noise.
[7:00:43] Count_Nodonora: @Insaif True but they gave it a gas engine noise, they could also have forgotten the lack of transmission.
[7:01:05] Insaif: @Count_Nodonora It seems like it's scuff, since I don't think it was making that noise yesterday.
[7:01:37] Count_Nodonora: @Insaif When she showed V? I think it did sound like this, I hated it then too.
[7:02:09] Insaif: Ah, my mistake, then.
[7:02:16] A_Humble_Wooper: Lots of electric cars have some amount of artificial engine noise added. Because otherwise they'd be so quiet they'd be safety hazards.
