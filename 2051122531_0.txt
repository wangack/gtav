[4:43:45] Nerdversity: cooking what? its sus
[4:43:45] Zewelly: victims voice doesnt matter
[4:43:46] ChainOfLightning: @MequelB he's thinking they might all be in it together to frame carmine

[4:45:18] Lucsvm: I mean if they did will have DNA right?
[4:45:26] Wallsh_: statements
[4:45:32] charybdes: get blood evidence on the ground.
[4:45:32] Switchblade142: @Wallsh_ They knew that Carmine was the last known person with the victim
[4:45:32] Zewelly: bees? you mean the city gaurd
[4:45:38] ltl_wackman: Pause massive sting
[4:45:45] ip33fr331y: we should document that your wrenches are clean of blood so that Carmine cannot easily argue that you did it.

[4:45:57] destinygun: @EsfandTV dna?
[4:46:04] Mic_Stargazer: @downtowner14 You can do 911 anonymously as a "local" if youre in a position youd never be found
[4:46:08] throat_pump: shouldn’t have told them you’d investigate 1 by 1 if you think this might be a settup
[4:46:09] a_man_cheetah: should inspect their wrenches
[4:46:10] Dougi: WICKED
[4:46:15] Thozel: mhm
[4:46:18] ltl_wackman: mhm
[4:46:19] EPiQ: @GlitchyGunZ Totally. I'm more commenting that people want both sides to always be considered and physical evidence ignored.
[4:46:27] GlitchyGunZ: check their items for dna tr to get more hard evidence
[4:46:28] xZENYUx: carmine can also argue that they have enough time to get rid of the bloody wrench since its been so long
[4:46:29] joefr33: @downtowner14 only if there are locals nearby...
[4:46:32] HeyMeghan: wasn’t frost supposed to collect the evidence?
