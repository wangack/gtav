[5:43:03] IAmSharkAttack: Eli and Yuno, a duo so spry, In Los Santos, where dreams touch the sky. Through streets of hustle, and neon glow, Adventures awaited, a dynamic show. Eli with mischief, Yuno with glee, Navigating chaos by the GTA sea. In Los Santos, their tales unfold, A city of stories, both young and bold. Cars revving engines, skyscrapers tall, Eli and Yuno, exploring it all. Through the chaos, laughter would bloom, In the heart of Los Santos, a vibrant room.
[5:43:13] Lexyz130: Awwww no intern Eli Sadge ?\
[5:43:17] jjthewannabee: by the LS sea?
[5:43:34] pocketsizedprincess: In Los Santos, where dreams take flight, Lived little Eli Lum, oh, such a delight. Through the city, with a grin so wide, Eli Lum explored, side by side. Skyscrapers tall, reaching for the sky, Eli Lum's laughter echoed nearby. In the streets of hustle and bustling sway, Eli danced through the sunny day. Cars zoomed by in the los santos sun, Eli Lum's adventures had just begun. In Los Santos, a place so grand, Eli Lum found joy in every strand.
