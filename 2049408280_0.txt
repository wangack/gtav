[9:28:47] Reznr: there’s no evidence to out Jordan anywhere
[9:28:47] Jake_Wini: How did they get a warrant for you
[9:28:48] its_giroux: guess it’s all a learning experience for the charactar itself
[9:28:48] Milk_exe: The cop straight up said there is a chance you can be iunnocent
[9:28:49] Rubber_Ducks: In the end you can mistrial this yeah?
[9:28:50] mkam225: yeah if this is considered PC that's pretty huge. Witness statements alone = arrest
[9:28:50] cartert2212: witness statements shouldn’t be weighed so heavily
[9:28:52] GunValkyrie_: how does blood indicate kidnapping?

[9:29:11] Seetherrr: @ArnoldFlibble yeah and there aren't really frivolous objections for 2 reasons, they only object when its valid/borderline and attorneys tend to not ask questions that could be objected to unless they are doing so for a reason

[9:29:16] roguegunslinger1: What's stopping people from just lying.

[9:29:27] Samoas: it’s weird detectives don’t interview their suspects.

[9:30:06] Seetherrr: @Thor_Garden yeah, someone needs to make a snitch gang and just make up bs about people so cops stop going 100% on testimony alone without evidence
[9:30:06] Kemli: the worst thing might be not questioning Jordan and just dismiss the case on prejudice
[9:30:07] JTVham: @PENTA Honest Question, if they are doing this organically and Jordan gets found guilty of this, would Wrangler now be able to just pump the shit out of people without PC using this case as a reference/Precident or would that be too OOC.

[9:33:37] Kemli: we saw that shit NODDERS but can they prove it Shruge
[9:33:38] bearded_canuck: he did ask for you to take him to the hospital which you eventually did, all he had was a broken nose so
[9:33:39] orlandito03: comes are pressing the charges for the victim, if the victim doesn’t want to press then why bother
[9:33:40] grafito: This could set a precedent to not arrest only on witness testimony
[9:33:40] tooterticket: @billsmafia24 go bills Sadge
[9:33:40] sterowentUS: @JTVham this court case may be the precedent then. surely the level of overruled objections is a sign that the prosecution wasn't doing their duty and rather was using a tactic outside of reason
[9:33:41] iLizard_King: with this judge im feelin straight L's
[9:33:41] con_squared: a salt
[9:33:41] tedium7: quick someone send that lcip to the judge!
[9:33:42] Zedisalive: everyone saying you hit him and Louie saying he didn't see who it was didn't help LuL

[9:33:43] adrianduh: @Oushu aicLICK aicSQUISH
[9:33:44] J4YFIN: i guess assault and thats it
[9:33:45] jiggleyflubbs: PJSalt
[9:33:45] Bolinko: tomorrow there will be no judges for the late shift
[9:33:46] aceNagas: "If I did it, he would be thankful"
[9:33:46] eoexplise_: aslong as it isnt kidnapping NODDERS
[9:33:47] tacklemove: Was it an accident?
[9:33:48] HyperGenics: 50/50 on assualt. 0% on kidnapping
[9:33:50] talkaboutwhat: grief ))
[9:33:51] ArticKong: would you consider the prosection dropping kidnapping and just cop the assault maybe?
[9:33:51] Kemli: I think he'll lower the charge NODDERS
[9:33:52] moreorless11: PixelBob if I did it
[9:33:52] Tear223: honestly I think the arrest was illegal
[9:33:53] sin_ikle: it really could go any way
[9:33:54] ShrimpCommander: if jordan gets not guilty of this doing it in front of 3 ada's LUL but nah rip
[9:33:54] TenderTeemo: I think the charge for kidnapping is worded odd
[9:33:54] WOOKlEE: Prayge Bike
[9:33:55] paitermees: why are they pushing random shit on jordan every time?
[9:33:57] nixtres: assault isnt that bad
[9:33:57] JTVham: @zed1207 It is though, judges rule based on previous results all the time.
[9:33:59] Toum_X2: yeah assault might stick
[9:33:59] nottuned: OBJECTION!
[9:33:59] Dalmondo: yes, but you guys are pals, just palling around. Friendly punch in the face and all that
[9:34:01] GayHibiscus: get this 🖕
[9:34:02] mibbl: did they ever establish that it was a pistol whip vs a flashlight
[9:34:02] nast1x: you 100% did
[9:34:02] Crosis86: i mean can he say he doesnt want to push assault effect the verdict?
[9:34:04] mkam225: I don't know how you get any of it based on witnesses period
[9:34:04] Relytt127: how can they prove the assault though? isnt it still just witness statements @PENTA
[9:34:05] CtrlDaltDel: @PENTA were you trying to hit his face or just hold  gun at him?
[9:34:05] jiggleyflubbs: FortOne
[9:34:06] Vortex265: HEARTSTONE GAMEPLAY OR SUBWAY RACER?
[9:34:07] TunaThyme: @PENTA can you show the kidnapping statute again?
[9:34:08] HunterOfReason: Very impressive big P
[9:34:10] Oushu: @adrianduh jbtvHype
[9:34:11] ReceBeast: The primary officer even said you could be innocent so
[9:34:11] nixtres: you might just walk on this
[9:34:11] mrjackstwitch: do you get your gun back?
[9:34:13] Hypnovile: SeemsGood
[9:34:13] SACancel: they needed this beatdown tbh
[9:34:13] Rubber_Ducks: Who wins the poll if the charges are 1/2
[9:34:16] Nurdal: is it a win if it's only assault?
[9:34:17] Zehring: Love how the whole courtroom is now trying to explain how the law works in similar hypothetical situations fairKEK
[9:34:17] ak_ottoko: Add it to the malicious prosecution case!
[9:34:23] sin_ikle: i think they had enough to detain and question
[9:34:24] 10xreloaded: hearthstone? Pog
[9:34:25] mezzanoon: You shoulda touched on that more in closing
[9:34:25] Jake_Wini: @penta how do warrants work? do they need a judge signed off here?
[9:34:29] Frippsy: Need more cadet audits
[9:34:29] Loremipsum21: A&B could still get his weapons license taken away if found guilty for hitting Louis with a gun.
[9:34:29] Qwaz: "Someone said you did it"
[9:34:30] fopplsh: If Nolan doesn't let you park the truck, they find the gun; the RP saved the gun from gettin found.
[9:34:30] Cory1750: not even questioning you is CRAAAZY
[9:34:31] Protoast60351: They had RS to detain, questions, and search you.
[9:34:32] BananaDuck: it’s been an interesting watch
[9:34:33] memerdub024: I think this case is a W but it's surprisingly close
[9:34:33] jiggleyflubbs: VoteYea
[9:34:33] PersonaLVR: I have a bad feeling it’s going to be “Across the street isn’t the hospital so you deceived him” and then guilty
[9:34:34] Catheter_Carl: If you only get assault, do you still consider this a W @penta
[9:34:35] Kemli: Standards in this server have been... interesting man
[9:34:35] notburry: Needed to question you to go further
[9:34:36] nixtres: people walk on this kind of shit irl all the time
[9:34:37] greystache402: Who signed the 'warrant'?
[9:34:40] Zeddiccus: Can't wait for Jordan to be found guilty and then they push perjury on a witness again KEKW
[9:34:42] Erigzback: Are those evidence Labels intended to be used as evidence in court?
[9:34:44] ShrimpCommander: 4Head can you stop a vehicle over rs tho
[9:34:45] sl33pyh3ad336: i mean they should of questioned you
[9:34:48] kstoo: Yea, like who decides what the bar is for using witness statements as PC? How many does it take, what determines credibility, etc.
[9:34:50] TenderTeemo: at least wrangler would have interrogated jordan
[9:34:51] mkam225: PEPW
[9:34:56] Can1rell: It's alright OG you did well
[9:34:57] TenderTeemo: or asked him at least

[9:35:00] mackfitzg: joy is known for reading between the lines
[9:35:01] Chunko_Muffo: The question you asked about  arrest warrant before they even found or spoke to you was good
[9:35:02] anextremeemo: me
[9:35:06] sterowentUS: @Erigzback they shouldn't be in this case at least, considering the gun placement was thrown out
[9:35:08] yung_dollar: feel like joy is experienced enough to pick up on that kinda stuff
[9:35:11] murkimurk_: that’s Mike level shit…”Mike Block did this” boom arrested! pentawBlock
[9:35:11] Loremipsum21: I would have pushed the intent part of A&B hard in closing. The prosecution didn't cover intent at all during the entire trial.
[9:35:17] J4YFIN: whats with cops not question suspects. Like i've seen that so much on onx
[9:35:17] redpandaszz: without the gun they have no physical evidence to link you to the scene
[9:35:17] xZailious: unless things are different now here
[9:35:19] orlandito03: @kstoo witness statement is hearsay
[9:35:24] yung_dollar: i mean joy ruled in favor of breakers first case
[9:35:24] Hento: I think they are trying to push that civs/non felons word means more Penta
[9:35:24] CurseYeeDinkleberg: Occams doesnt play Nolan with all his law knowledge
[9:35:26] WingsDub: what was up with the gun tag from Jordan Steele?
[9:35:26] Bruh_17_: All witness statements are so unreliable KEKW
[9:35:27] kstoo: That’s what I mean, the bar for that can’t be set in stone, it would be different for each person
[9:35:28] MrRowdy91: @PENTA i think he did it on purpose
[9:35:29] Moosebrother: eye witness testimony is the weakest thing
[9:35:29] Kemli: well...
[9:35:30] jiggleyflubbs: SeemsGood
[9:35:30] Rickets89: can they become PC with an affidavit or whatever
[9:35:30] MustardPlant: Think it's cause they're ADAs
[9:35:30] mrjackstwitch: town of Salem
[9:35:31] Huso833: Nolan isn't a smurf
[9:35:32] AzureMarquis: IF 10 people said "jordan murdered a man" it wouldn't stick
[9:35:34] Payasadas: I don't think that's true, unless it's different in RP than IRL
[9:35:38] greystache402: Occams plays loose on cop
[9:35:39] JFTvJrsRifle: If you are identified?
[9:35:40] JanValentini: yeh Nolan is just ok in court
[9:35:42] Amocoru: It would be so OP if he did
[9:35:44] nixtres: good RP NODDERS
[9:35:44] ItsMeMattK: I think if yoiu have asked Occam's judge that, the answer would have been far different.
[9:35:45] emperor_beardo: If they had questioned you and you had an alibi, then it would be he said/she said which is reasonable susception, tham not questioning you is no due dillegence
[9:35:45] Hento: Nolen is a Sniper lol
[9:35:45] ToastedRubber: That's not true.

[9:36:22] Payasadas: for IRL it's a reasonable person test, RS = would a reasonable person suspect but not know, PC = would a reaonsable person believe to be factually true
[9:36:24] ak_ottoko: I can see the argument; they have a victim, and blood evidence of an assault, with 3 witnesses saying it was him. But no other physical evidence tying him to it
[9:36:24] EyelessWolf: cus then you could just get a lot of ppl then say someone did something

[9:37:06] rainboworigin: you need PC to go into a house?????
[9:37:06] papa_starch4: moon2WOW
[9:37:08] thatboosh: frisking jordan would be the house entering
[9:37:09] Dalmondo: If thats true IRL, we are all fucked. Three people can just lie about something you didnt do and that's enough evidence to arrest/charge you? Police would 100% question you and get your side of things, and search u if needed
[9:37:10] Loremipsum21: I think the prosecution did a lot to prove Jordan hit Louis. But, Assault & Battery requires intent to seriously harm. Nobody touched on that.
[9:37:11] Catheter_Carl: RS is just the tip?
[9:37:11] Togod_: how do you enter a house with rs what
[9:37:12] Rubber_Ducks: If the owners allow you in yeah

[9:37:18] Jetamo: You're telling me they found a PC in Bill Gates' house?! WOOW
[9:37:23] orlandito03: YOU’d need PC TO Get a warrant to enter a house
[9:37:23] talkaboutwhat: penta they probably let the cops in
[9:37:24] nixtres: it has to be really solid
[9:37:24] Vortex265: how come you didnt make this argument in court or does it not work like that
[9:37:25] Hento: or evidence activly going bye bye

[9:37:29] Protoast60351: Unless someone is in danger
[9:37:31] Moosebrother: but other than that no
[9:37:31] Ingeniumm: You use RS to get a search warrant
[9:37:33] Askos_: but what about a car?
[9:37:33] merky699: if the door is unlocked
[9:37:34] fatpaulie91: exigent circumstances ayeee

[9:37:40] slimey_slaps: @JanValentini hot pursuit you still need PC just don't have to get that PC approved by a judge

[9:37:42] hexlight_: K
[9:37:43] TomHanks: just claim ES everytime EZ

[9:37:46] sin_ikle: damning evidence to get a search warrent right?

[9:37:52] CRPLDninja: Lol @jetamo
[9:37:52] coltvhd: this makes no sense Mr big penta bill gates literally invented PC
[9:37:53] JTVham: RS leads to the warrant possibly right?
[9:37:53] Beerman155: that’s literally why the gun charge was dropped. they searched the car without pc
[9:37:54] Qwaz: @Moosebrother existent bro? KEKW
[9:37:56] ArnoldFlibble: The standard for getting a search warrant is less than an arrest
[9:38:01] mrjackstwitch: anonymous witness falls short of rs. it’s a reason to knock on the door and say hello, but not to enter
[9:38:01] goshdanghecker: exigent is one of those words that just makes chat light up
[9:38:02] jdogg91288: just a random tip that oh drugs are here is not enough for a judge to sign it unless they are stupid KEKW
[9:38:03] orlandito03: @ingeniumm RS DOESNT GET YOU A WARRANT, warrants are based on PC
[9:38:04] JFTvJrsRifle: How hard is RP Identifying a person taken into fact? @PENTA
[9:38:07] Vortex265: can bloom just come and let steele go
[9:38:10] Payasadas: @JTVham RS is enough for detainment, PC is the threshold for search warrants and arrests
[9:38:17] Huso833: It says the cops watched them smuggle drugs so it's not like they got the tip and went to arrest
[9:38:17] Chunko_Muffo: You can go to the front door and inquire. If you smell drugs coming out of someone's front door... Is that exigency that evidence could be destroyed? Tough legal question @penta
[9:38:18] rainboworigin: this case has 3 corroborating witnesses with blood on scene that’s definitely enough for PC lol@
[9:38:22] greystache402: It boils down to 'you did that shit'....but you defended like a boss and established doubt.  Is what it is.
[9:38:23] volazal: Warrants need PC I thought
[9:38:24] HeyUdontSay_That1010: damn what are all these lawyers doing in here on Wednesday night at 2 am

[9:38:35] TenderTeemo: I do be dumb tho
[9:38:39] Beerman155: warrants DO GET SIGNED though off just RS as it’s typically up to whatever judge is is writing it.
