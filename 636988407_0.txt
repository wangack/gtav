[5:05:24] 3spada_Grande: I mean I get it they don't want to interrupt others serious RP but who's doing that in mirror park
[5:05:28] BolbiBaggins: just have scheduled "fight clubs" that just so happen to start before tsunami
[5:05:29] NecroticAnubis: like yes don't interrupt ongoing situations but other than that I don't see the problem smh
[5:05:30] thatloljunkie: the khajits earlier were harcore breaking rp.

[5:05:36] 0xygenhomie: it is what it is
[5:05:37] cloudboujee: was it because u guys brought it to the pd instead of keeping it in mirror park? @uberhaxornova
[5:05:39] robbers12345: problem was that it was brought to PD with RP still going on im pretty sure
[5:05:40] pro_noun_ci_ation: im guessing it because some people play it out/have an active scene. and someone rolls in and magdumps haha
