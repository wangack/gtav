[6:51:19] Falling_Pelican: Okay if it didn't that would be a headache
[6:51:47] uitzui: it is kinda handy too since it just gives you a total list of what it wants
[6:51:56] uitzui: so no guessing or tracking during designing
[6:52:42] jdeflume: Curious what create room and link room do. Like saving clusters of furniture?
