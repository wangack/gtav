[2:34:48] gRi_in: clear one colour so that only pairs of it are left
[2:34:50] PakuroSama: just eliminate multiple colors and make sure theres not one left
[2:34:51] kevin24seven: i think you were doin pretty good
[2:34:52] supermegahamster: you have to get a feel for how the blocks move when you eliminate a patch

[2:34:55] akin014: 4head does it like that and he gets like 14/14 and shit
[2:34:57] xnewzz: yeah for sure, it took 5
[2:34:57] whtsgud: maybe the move is focusing on making single dots connect
[2:35:08] alexlipson: just dont start left side or at the bottom, shit's gonna fall down without any control @omie
[2:35:12] luckerooni: the real trick is just checking the singles on the edges and making sure they can snap together before you eliminate the ones needed
