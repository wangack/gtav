[6:07:46] Blaze_null: Gotcha, did he say anything about the packer?
[6:07:52] ox_sandman: busted
[6:07:59] totally_not_ducu: neutrenHi @ox_sandman
[6:08:04] Roe_the_Second: so question for someone who hasnt watch nopixel till just recently is a storm just a server reset?
[6:08:09] 3_A_B_C: peepoHey sandman
[6:08:10] twoflykevv: u think the packer would be worth it
[6:08:12] DrakeNightbane: @Roe_the_Second yep
[6:08:17] Roe_the_Second: TY
[6:08:26] DrakeNightbane: How close are ya to the packer?
[6:08:26] CYDERVERSE: @Roe_the_Second Yep, pretty much. Storm/reset happens every 12hrs at 11am/11pm PST
[6:08:34] Webster: Someone mentioned that it would set on fire easily and was pretty bugged
[6:08:37] Webster: But who knows how true that is
[6:08:39] Roe_the_Second: cool ty ty
[6:08:48] ox_sandman: neutrenHi @3_A_B_C @totally_not_ducu
[6:08:51] CYDERVERSE: @DrakeNightbane He's there, but just needs to buy it \
[6:09:10] goldencate: doesnt seem worth it unless you get blueprints or something else
[6:09:11] Lunalynn4: @Webster set on fire? its electric?
[6:09:15] kalanw420: The pack is a 5th wheel trailer right?
[6:09:26] EyeScraem: @Lunalynn4 nah it would explode randomly and stuff
[6:09:29] EyeScraem: it was super scuffed
[6:09:32] Lunalynn4: Ohhh
[6:09:36] DrakeNightbane: @DrakeNightbane Ye, I know its like 58k after tax? How close is Octo to hitting that?
[6:09:59] Lunalynn4: He has about 25k to his name
[6:09:59] Webster: @Webster Not electric, just very susceptible to damage vs the Pounder
[6:10:08] ox_sandman: oh i seen a beautiful nsx on a trailer at work on thursday made me wanted to plan a heist lol
[6:10:34] Lunalynn4: @Webster like it wasnt already expensive to fix
[6:10:39] Webster: Right? lol
[6:10:46] Blaze_null: 60k? Yikes. I hope the pay is as good as the t3 grupe 6 truck on the investment
[6:10:57] Blaze_null: neutrenCopium
[6:11:16] Webster: Yeah, I think it's the attached bed, like the big Euro trucks
[6:11:32] Roe_the_Second: its a separate prop
[6:11:35] EyeScraem: I wouldn't be surprised if they increase the cost once packer gets buffed
[6:11:40] kalanw420: It's like tow trucks
[6:11:57] ox_sandman: if they do have it that way people could possibly steal it
[6:12:08] bbcherry24: Hmm interesting 🤔
[6:12:09] Lunalynn4: uhoh
[6:12:11] mimmakata: PauseChamp
[6:12:11] sarahm9889: Hmmm
[6:12:12] twoflykevv: loaded
[6:12:18] Webster: oop
[6:12:19] shadow_monarch16: neutrenHmmm
[6:12:29] EyeScraem: means less contracts which is how you make money
[6:12:47] mimmakata: we will seee
[6:12:53] EyeScraem: nodd we'll see
[6:13:10] CYDERVERSE: The Grime science is changing INSANECAT
[6:13:11] Blaze_null: But hey looking at the pay rate for the packer runs, even though you can't start it yet. It seems decent, but we'll see how long a run for that would be
[6:13:37] twoflykevv: the pay wasn’t increased a lil?
[6:13:44] Webster: Speed of completion vs total weight reward? Or am I barking up the wrong tree
[6:13:49] T0XIQZ: have you bought a car yet?
[6:13:53] Drow_Fury: pay was nerfed
[6:13:58] 3_A_B_C: @T0XIQZ !cars
[6:14:01] CYDERVERSE: !cars
[6:14:01] Nightbot: Octavio owns the Penumbra (aka MK5 Supra), and Kitty owns the Comet. They share the two cars
[6:14:12] T0XIQZ: thanks
[6:14:14] EyeScraem: @Webster its number of contracts, speed and number boxes or even weight doesn't matter
[6:14:25] EyeScraem: @Webster but that also could have changed
[6:14:31] Webster: Interesting
[6:14:47] bbcherry24: It might not even be that bad we have to see
[6:15:02] twoflykevv: they tryna stop the grind but u a great white shark
[6:15:08] Lunalynn4: Yeah thats not a lot
[6:15:10] sarahm9889: i'm wondering if they are adjusting things because more people are at packer now
[6:15:47] Webster: Slashed by 1/3rd and now people arriving at the Pounder are paying tax on purchase oop
[6:16:06] Khaos_The_Lock: @Webster no tax
[6:16:19] Drow_Fury: there is a tax
[6:16:20] Webster: Really? Tonish had to pay more than 25k
[6:16:21] EyeScraem: packer could have gotten adjusted when g6 stuff changed too
[6:16:29] Blaze_null: Oh so only taxes on income was removed and not purchases oop
[6:16:32] Drow_Fury: the punder was 25k its 28k with the tax now
[6:16:33] twoflykevv: I think the max g6 van is good while the second one is bad so maybe they made the packers better and pounders a lil worse
[6:16:34] EyeScraem: @Khaos_The_Lock theres tax now
[6:16:38] Khaos_The_Lock: u need enough in your bank for a 30% tax but it doesnt actually take the money
[6:16:53] EyeScraem: oh really?
[6:17:00] Khaos_The_Lock: yuh
[6:17:38] Blaze_null: So contract based?
[6:17:39] Lunalynn4: You can go do other things
[6:17:43] mimmakata: paid more but lower rep growing?
[6:17:54] Ravixini: grime gonna get nerfed x2 and given 2h cooldown PepeLa
[6:18:22] Dasperhue: when are we getting paacker chat
[6:18:29] Blavod: maybe they will make t3 worth COPIUM
[6:18:46] Dasperhue: they havent fixed t3 yet ?
[6:18:48] EyeScraem: it didn't seem intentional LUL
[6:19:02] cliffscorner: Is packer not worth?
[6:19:03] Dasperhue: its been a prob since the start. didnt think any1 tried it for real yet
[6:19:08] Blavod: maybe they just said w/e leave it
[6:19:18] EyeScraem: @cliffscorner no one really knows because of the high investment
[6:19:23] Dasperhue: @cliffscorner not in the beginning. dont know if it has been fixed
[6:19:28] cliffscorner: I feel like with the route updates it should be a lot better

[6:25:29] goju_pampin: you will get the packer before that
[6:26:47] Firepokachu: get the packer, pack with tony EZ fix
[6:27:12] Blaze_null: I just hope they make changes to trucking similar to grupe 6, like the dropping off contracts for a change of pace neutrenNote
[6:27:30] cliffscorner: you have to buy pounder first still though so 75k
[6:27:45] Dasperhue: its it 50k ?
[6:27:51] Dasperhue: isnt*
[6:27:55] 0G_Lean: this is exactly how my amazon delivery get to me in one day
[6:27:58] cliffscorner: if you think about it if you make 500 more for the same time, it'd take 100 runs to pay back the initial investment
[6:28:14] cliffscorner: that's 100 hour payback time is pretty crazy
[6:28:18] semma11: you running gta in 60fps on 240hz monitor ?
[6:28:37] Firepokachu: that or you get like goated blueprints
[6:28:40] Dasperhue: gomer did this in the beginning. the thing is the pay is basicly the same as pounder, but u get a lot longer trips, so it takes longer and u have a lot more milage on the car
[6:28:57] cliffscorner: 40 hour work week...
[6:29:36] BfAleTitan: could start grinding groupe 6 yea?
[6:29:39] Blaze_null: Nah even 50k for packer is crazy, while t2 to t3 g6 truck is just 10k more?
[6:29:44] Blavod: yeah for their t3 they got contracts
[6:29:49] sarahm9889: he'll lose Grime rep
[6:29:57] sarahm9889: if he does Gruppe 6
[6:30:02] BfAleTitan: he won't since he is maxed right?
[6:30:12] sarahm9889: don't think it works like that anymore
[6:30:15] BfAleTitan: ah
[6:30:19] mimmakata: win for streamers and their mental healt
[6:30:31] cliffscorner: it allows more time for actual rp
[6:30:40] Tur4no: Can't G6 do also Sani?
[6:30:52] twoflykevv: they just on that grind set they must like working like dogs
[6:31:11] Blavod: @Tur4no nah sani wrecks g6 rep
[6:31:25] Tur4no: @Blavod frick
[6:31:32] Demoo94: cooldown is just a paid vacation LUL
[6:31:34] Blaze_null: @blavod g6 is all contract based now iirc, t2 and t3 have specific contracts now and you can juggle them during their downtime
[6:31:48] Dasperhue: people are gonna swim in money just like 3.0 with this. i thought they said 4.0 was suppost to be a lot slower but it doesnt appear this way with the changes

[6:51:30] ozokar: so you could afford to chill a bit more
[6:51:46] pscetti: a lot of the stuff was implemented super bare bones to get 4.0 out earlier than planned so its kinda shitty as people are investing so much time into professions that they have no idea what they will turn into

[6:53:11] Dasperhue: the one starting businesses are borring those money from grinders
[6:53:19] SiImeria_: if he was alone he would probably not have the cars at all
[6:53:24] cliffscorner: yeah like people paying 20k+ for a crowbar that costs like 1k to make
[6:53:36] Khaos_The_Lock: @SiImeria_ But he aint thats the point lol

[6:53:44] Dasperhue: yep
[6:53:46] goldencate: @Khaos_The_Lock thats why hes saying hes not ahead other peple, they just spent it on other stuff
[6:53:47] pscetti: @SiImeria_ except he's gotten zero money out of being in teh group...so really he would have hadh the cars earlier if anything lol

[7:01:53] Tur4no: very

[7:03:41] rubano_01: @sarahm9889 can't octo ask the bois for a small loan to get that 50k?
