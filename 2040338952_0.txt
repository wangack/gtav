[2:46:04] frigginoasis: YEA
[2:46:21] ThicccBrickBoi: @timbres as in the "rapper" six nine that's a snitch
[2:50:39] jojaha: can't you just print your lures at library etc.? no need to buy whole printer if won't make that much
[2:51:04] six_o_nine: @jojaha fking libraries have 3d printers up there? KEKW
[2:51:12] jojaha: in finland some too ye
[2:51:38] six_o_nine: thats finland tho, he lives in MURICA, he will find guns in a library before a useful thing KEKW
[2:51:48] kannar_tv: pick up a CR-10S and filament and do it yourself?
[2:51:55] jojaha: true. might be wise to check stuff out tho if possible
[2:52:13] kannar_tv: there's a few resin printers that work nice out of the box too
[2:52:25] kannar_tv: NODDERS
[2:52:39] SlinkyMcMasters: even more expensive
[2:53:29] kannar_tv: Sadge yeah, those larger ones get pricy
[2:53:30] jojaha: can also print in 2 pieces and glue together or something
[2:53:32] six_o_nine: 8 inches? ya wanna fish em or utterly destroy the fishes with those weapons of mass destruction?
[2:54:02] NemisizZ: keep in mind with a resin printer you also need a bath u can clean the print in, then curing thing with uv light before its ready
[2:56:19] JackLDN27: LUL
[2:57:44] DonJonMartin: anycubic has cheap ones
[2:58:08] NemisizZ: theres a ton of resin printers, id go for a 4k theres higher, but 4k is pretty good
[2:58:28] SlinkyMcMasters: thats alot of baits to make it worth it
[2:58:56] NemisizZ: under the bath is a screen that projects a layer on the thingy that dips
[2:58:57] Dangerouscrave: @travpiper  is there a way you can use a pourable resin then you could get a cheaper 3d to make the molds you want
[2:59:14] Madlaugher: No fab shops here in Austin you can work with for a few runs?
[2:59:17] NemisizZ: also, resin can warp as well
[2:59:52] Nightbot: stay up to date on shit - twitter.com/travpiper | instagram.com/travpiper

[3:00:56] NemisizZ: depends on how u do it tbh, lets say u just wanna print the lure, then a resin would get all the details, that u can use to cast in silicone which u cast ur lures in after
[3:01:11] NemisizZ: silicone is expensive
[3:01:24] Nightbot: check out my merch at https://dotexe.com/collections/travpiper
[3:01:55] SlinkyMcMasters: looking at 30 baits to pay off probably plus experiments... then you gotta paint each one but that could be fun

[3:02:01] Nightbot: IMGONNACUM
[3:02:13] six_o_nine: KEKW
[3:02:14] Nidas: self propelled baits that come back when they fall off the fkn string shit
[3:02:15] NemisizZ: im not to familiar with the materials for resin, but to my knowledge a lot of those is very fragile
[3:02:20] kannar_tv: moon2LEWD
[3:02:28] Nidas: i went fishing last year in swedish fast streams and lost prob 30 drags in 30 throws

[3:02:51] Nidas: very pog
[3:03:07] SlinkyMcMasters: is there a slot in the back for tail or the way you made wiggles itself?
[3:03:24] Ferrari1776: what is this?
[3:03:39] Phatphuk420: This is for a mold?
[3:04:08] EpicHuggles: oof
[3:04:43] EpicHuggles: thats actually insane
[3:05:16] HavocusRex: I don't fish often, but it felt bad to lose $25 baits to a snag underwater, can't imagine 60+ lol
[3:05:21] SlinkyMcMasters: the eyelet slot could serve as the weight hole too
