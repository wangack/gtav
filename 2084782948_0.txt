[0:47:05] prunken_dotato: it wasnt even a gun though, it was because of the spike strips and Cornwoods phone
[0:47:05] mikecollin12: the 1440 is government employee the second 1440 is for the gun
[0:47:05] heartyj2: yes

[0:47:06] ExessiveGK: he had cornwoods phone on him thats why
[0:47:06] cthonaut: you would literally get a lesser charge for shooting a cop
[0:47:06] SClarke1393: it’s cheaper to shoot them than to rob them
[0:47:07] REAPER_Replicator: he could have killed 10+ cops and the time would be les
[0:47:08] xtylaw: no 󠀀
[0:47:10] dingbatco: basicly
[0:47:10] jacob1244555: gun

[0:47:24] calisoultaker27: might as well just kill the cop
[0:47:24] CoryR: he would have gotten less time/fine if he just clapped cornwood
[0:47:25] KKumare: its stupid
[0:47:26] Scoot_DiggityDog: it’s less to kidnap then to rob. lol
[0:47:29] FredCourville: you can kill like 25 cops and get less time
[0:47:34] corrutped_sunvaar: You are better off shooting a cop than robbing one
[0:47:34] madm4rsh: K was saying that just shooting the cops is the way out now. Don't rob or kidnap them. Just shoot them and you get less sentence than robbing
[0:47:39] Nzlaten: Also they nerfed lockpicks again cop cars are now 3 times harder to lockpick LUL
[0:47:41] MamaPr1m3: they didnt care he was disarming they charged him with theft plus kills on the gun
[0:47:42] LongCIaww: killing is better

[0:48:58] xco73: rob=1day+fine  gun=1day+100k fine
[0:48:58] WallyWeaver: @Shotz  they charged him with each item from the cop and robbery not just the blanket charge of robbery witch it should of been
[0:48:58] Scoot_DiggityDog: Apparently robbing a cop is the worst thing you can do there. lol
[0:48:58] madm4rsh: Also, they said "robbing" is still telling the cop to put his stuff in the glove box.
[0:48:59] mdwstbeatdown: they literally dont want you to rp with cops
[0:49:03] theonyxedition: He admitting to not robbing him and only kidnap lol
[0:49:04] heretikk_: you could kill 28 cops and get the same time as robbing 1

[0:49:09] JIMMYJOEJOYCE: cops are gods
[0:49:10] IAmBr3tt: Yep
[0:49:12] KKumare: @Shotz K having the phone of cornwood and the DNA on his weapon, because he picked it up. was about 3k hours. killiing 4 ppl (two of them judges) and 4times use of gun + illegal gun was like 300min.
[0:49:13] MamaPr1m3: kill dont steal
[0:49:14] UKzs_: It doesn't make sense LMAO
[0:49:14] Asplunds: yee
[0:49:14] Warchyle: And never touch gun cause then its possession even if u dont have it
[0:49:15] REAPER_Replicator: K should have killed 20+ cops and got the same time for it
[0:49:15] BasedPennsylvania: just kill em.
[0:49:16] FredCourville: you rob them after you kill them all
[0:49:17] lynch1010_: over kidnapping
[0:49:21] poopy1028: No way to kidnap them either
[0:49:23] madm4rsh: They also increased the cop cars lockpick. You can't lockpick a cop car anymore? It takes two lockpicks now.
[0:49:23] ChadDolblin: The cops are a protected class
[0:49:24] owenawesomedude: robbing an officer = 1440 months / touching their gun is possession another 1440 months

[0:49:28] Dustbug: they are gods
[0:49:31] mikecollin12: 1440 to rob any government employee, then an additional 1440 if your fingerprints are on the gun (the gun wasnt even on K)
[0:49:31] jasonv6j: KEKW that got me too
[0:49:31] Maverick2813: that scared me 😂😂
[0:49:33] Crazybro: Legit commtting murder is better because they don't fine you 100k for that LUL
[0:49:38] highjayare: And to get a legal gun almost 100k 😂😂
[0:49:40] rickster649: that’s nopixel for ya
[0:49:40] lynch1010_: exactly
[0:49:41] GenWoIf: The biggest issue is "robbing" a cop of their gun is the ONLY way to disarm them and kidnap them. So kidnapping a cop is just a 3000 month charge lol
[0:49:41] RandyC4: k was saying he wouldve got less time and fine if he just shot cornwood
[0:49:44] Jeremy9000CS2: Immortal cops nowadays

[0:50:24] jcashion08: time served covered all the charges on the "molten hot" 1911
[0:50:24] GenWoIf: The biggest issue is "robbing" a cop of their gun is the ONLY way to disarm them to kidnap them. So kidnapping a cop is just a 3000 month charge basically lol
[0:50:25] schristy23: what up shotzzz
[0:50:25] Ast3roidkill3r: It's ass backwards

[2:23:03] NCry_Rexxer: wait but moonwater is my favorite
[2:23:12] Raccoonlamundo: Moonwater is the best
[2:23:15] thatguydancingintheclub: To put it simply, Moon water is water that has been charged by the Moon. You can create Moon water by leaving water outdoors to charge under the moonlight. Because the Moon affects the ocean’s tides, there’s already an energetic connection between the element of water and the Moon. When you add intention (and maybe a crystal or two), you can create a tool that can be used for everything from watering your plants to adding to your ritual bath to cleansing your home.
[2:23:24] jointspecialist: doesn't she know moon energy goes through plastic and glass? You can leave a sealed bottle under moonlight for the same effect Kappa
