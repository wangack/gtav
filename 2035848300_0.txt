[7:18:49] cybonics_: Hey offline chat
[7:18:50] Delnoir: Honestly I don't think creatives having conversations with themselves switching between characters is all that weird.
[7:18:53] goldenjii: the voices
[7:18:54] Sieferifle: Svardenduden isnt gonna be your super serious character? Sadding
[7:19:03] LetsGoPolice: affixes suck this week?

[7:19:24] goldenjii: last year awaree
[7:19:31] Vikinick: so if you have a shaman you just ignore half the afflicted
[7:19:59] Vikinick: bolstering is a DPS affix which means PUGs are awful to heal

[7:24:18] dr_plox: theres a lot of external pressure
[7:24:45] Sieferifle: its not just rp Sadding
[7:24:45] kookymonstir: I live in LA and I'm the same way.  I made the mistake of buying a house though, so it's a lot harder to get out.  I've been thinking hard about getting the fk outa here.
[7:25:15] goldenjii: you know subconciously
[7:25:18] Huso833: People regress sometimes when they visit parents
[7:25:37] Sieferifle: Pog
[7:25:48] theblazinwzn: moose at a furry convention Pog
[7:26:07] Delnoir: Movin' is tough. Sadge
[7:26:33] Sieferifle: Pissing off balconies
[7:26:38] itsbubbzi: Have your shoes for the ball arrived yet?
[7:26:50] Lurks_like_Gaston: Gotta take Kermodo with you NODDERS
[7:27:01] MrUberproof: so just a deck ?
[7:27:06] Swiftym8: this guy just straight pissing into the street
[7:27:20] Sieferifle: swamp boys
[7:27:25] harriettheegg: NotLikeThis
[7:27:29] Delnoir: If you haven't pissed in your backyard you haven't lived. It confuses the shit out of the family dog KEKW
[7:27:34] Kaia_32: nice
[7:27:46] Con_Jhena: Have you always flown back home?
[7:27:58] MrUberproof: yeah you were in a bad mood

[7:28:11] Bowes0: Sometimes you can't prevent that shit unfortunately
[7:28:13] goldenjii: i'm the only one that pisses here, ME THE DOG Madge
[7:28:20] Sieferifle: Just make all your streams a funk at this point so it doesnt seem any different
[7:28:26] LexTheQueer: it takes time for that shit to leave your system, like process out of you
[7:28:26] Swiftym8: you should stream so then chat can cheer you up!!!
[7:28:48] Chrysaetos: Brain go brr sometimes NODDERS
[7:28:49] Hento: yea just needed a lil reset
[7:28:53] Delnoir: Honestly? It could be leavin' the family again. I live 15 minutes from my parents and it always feels like shit when I have to leave them.
[7:28:53] Huso833: Pog Live stream in Louisiana, wrestle an alligator
[7:29:33] AUXdub: please do not take this wrong or in an aggressive way, but have you talked to someone about this?
[7:29:41] Swiftym8: Gladge yeah we are
[7:29:44] Lurks_like_Gaston: orcOK

[7:29:53] LetsGoPolice: Mardi Gras IRL stream. every bead toss = russian roulette chance of a ban
[7:30:02] goldenjii: yeah but have you tried smoking DMT with your family?
[7:31:11] Vikinick: it's always that zen garden with that stupid sand rake
[7:31:17] AUXdub: bro, i didn't think it would help when I could talk to someone about anxiety and aggression. I'm almost 40 and just yelling your problems at a stranger for a few minutes helped me.
[7:31:34] LexTheQueer: overcum
[7:31:34] Bowes0: Therapy also isn't for everyone
[7:31:43] Delnoir: Going to therapy was a doozy. My parents paid a "professional" to tell them I have shitty self-esteem. Like no shit, I already knew that.

[8:04:29] Lurks_like_Gaston: The only memories I have of doing arma rp was when hackers would TP the entire server out of map Sadding
[8:04:43] Splaterz: mine was legit Criken kiwo penta moose
[8:05:00] LexTheQueer: i watched CallMeKevin when he was briefly RPing, then UberHaxorNova's stuff on YouTube, then made the leap to watching James live, and found you while scrolling the GTA category when James was late and i wanted something to watch in the meantime
[8:05:23] Seetherrr: @AUXdub yeah the video is hilarious, he showed it to JFTV and JFTV gave him a $30 payment after, and later in the stream he called Jayce a clown a bunch of times to get him angry enough to help him escape from bloom and like 4 other cops PEPW
[8:05:37] Sieferifle: Dawg I randomly clicked on a fuslie stream when she was getting arrested by pred and bloom in paleto and bloom just went on a tangent about being addicted to gambling
[8:05:44] MrUberproof: God my first Criken video was his left 4 dead stuff in like 2011
[8:05:46] monnclock: those old left4dead he did
[8:05:51] AUXdub: onx is a good server but competing with NP content seems tough as a viewer. i'm worried they up to 400 of lackluster rp.
[8:05:57] theblazinwzn: i found you through the clip in the vault with burns BatChest character

[8:07:19] Lurks_like_Gaston: I wonder how many hoppers would show up if you removed ONX from the title
[8:07:22] Vikinick: I think the problem with 4.0s RP is that almost all the crim groups just... stayed together and remembered each other
[8:07:32] DemonLord81: the rp has been good Kreygasm
