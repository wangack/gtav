[5:20:54] Fossabot: In role-playing games, metagaming is an "out of character" action where a player's character makes use of knowledge that the player is aware of but that the character is not meant to be aware of. Giving Moon information on what's happening in another stream facilitates metagaming and ruins the experience for everyone.

[7:20:16] timewarper9000: feel like the only way that could be even a little legit is if they added a hacking minigame when your near somone and you could hack there phone and it would alert them and they get 20 seconds or so to prevent it.

[8:42:17] DannyF1orida: Neo is on

[8:42:21] Hento: I wonder if there is a way to grow seeds from the actual weed
[8:42:30] Narcissicm: since you can sell more than 1 if someone walks up to you, but only get 1 shot at ruby
[8:42:31] Wool_story: Unlucky or intentional, rep grind maybe yields more over time
[8:42:41] KosumoNZ: you need to play more music with "Ruby" in it when selling
[8:42:50] Thaang: maybe there's more seeds in cars now
[8:42:57] Hento: or yea rep maybe increases rewards
[8:42:57] early_retirement: yeah should be at least guaranteed to get what u put into it, with a chance for random bonus
[8:42:59] UnleadedGames: @Narcissicm Yea what I was thinking. Selling more than 1 might be a detriment. Probably doesn't increase ruby odds.
[8:43:01] early_retirement: not totally random
