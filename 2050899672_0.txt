[3:09:16] highway27: @pmoonbuddy And according to statistics over 90% of accidents involving a Semi truck are the fault of a car or as we call ya'll 4 wheelers
[3:10:05] Tateo13: DAMN SHE FINE TRUCK.

[3:16:14] 8R00KS: @SailorWS yes
[3:16:16] SailorWS: The Cornwood rock
[3:16:18] Morfius53_: Yee, 57k after tax I believe
[3:16:27] Lordbidwell: Correct
[3:16:36] pmoonbuddy: If Mr. K didn't empty Gomer's pockets every day, he'd have one by now easily
[3:16:49] Lordbidwell: Not wrong
[3:17:09] 8R00KS: Thankfully Vinny took care of K otherwise it would have happened again
[3:17:18] Crazybro: K real estate though is one of the BEST money making in the city though
[3:17:42] pmoonbuddy: It will be, eventually
[3:17:47] pmoonbuddy: Well, it should be
[3:17:49] UnknownT666: @Crazybro Also the least profitable so far KEKW
[3:17:56] SFGMOD: if they don't lose all the houses first
[3:18:25] Crazybro: @UnknownT666 it's not instant money but it's money that can't be fined etc.
[3:18:34] killogic916: @Crazybro that clip from Budda was totally unbinformed. There is 0% chance K is anywhere the most welthy on the server
[3:18:34] halos420: hes going to lose another 30k in investor money when he gets caught with the PD gun again so
[3:18:42] CrAzYMaYnE: Sexxy big boi
[3:18:45] MissinMyTeeth: did k pay those investors after you filled out spreadsheet?
[3:18:56] SFGMOD: doubt it
[3:18:58] halos420: @killogic916 yeah not even close. there is people with 100k cars and houses
[3:19:08] UnknownT666: @killogic916 Asset wise he's got like 800k
[3:19:08] EpicGriefer: also need to get paid for the materials that are current placed in that house
[3:19:10] Crazybro: @killogic916 you think after all the investors get paid out and make their 10% K couldnt sell all 4 properties and make 1mil?
[3:19:24] halos420: on paper, his liquid assets make it seem like he owns the most, but none of it is really
[3:19:25] halos420: HOS
[3:19:27] halos420: HIS
[3:19:28] killogic916: @killogic916 @UnknownT666 except like 90% of that isnt his
[3:19:31] DrewCo_Racing_: im surprised they dont have you pick up and drop off trailers  at locatations
[3:19:38] xolision: @killogic916 poroperties are still growing in value, it would upo to 2mil
[3:19:45] pmoonbuddy: Could easily make 1 million‚Ä¶ But then he has to pay out his boys like gomer who have paid in so much money
[3:19:53] UnknownT666: @killogic916 Yeah but on paper they are thats what buddah wouldve seen
[3:19:53] killogic916: @Crazybro you dont know how to do math
[3:20:08] CrAzYMaYnE: Quick maths lol
[3:20:12] Crazybro: @killogic916 yes i do..
[3:20:25] halos420: gomer needs to hold the money for mr k cause hes going to get -30k again when he gets caught for the second pd gun LOL
[3:20:27] theonyxedition: He has the most networth
[3:20:30] xolision: if he was smart he can leverage those properties for more loans. aha
[3:20:39] xolision: rich with debt
[3:20:45] killogic916: he can get 1 million sure, but he has to pay out 900k of that to other people @Crazybro
[3:20:45] ComaToasted: grinds your gears
[3:20:51] CrAzYMaYnE: I think gomer has the most
[3:20:59] BUZZpunk: Easily has the most debt of anyone so far
[3:21:04] b0nb0mb: He's probably spent the most with the cost of houses too
[3:21:09] pmoonbuddy: Gomer easily has the most invested
[3:21:10] Azzarill: Langs point was that he RP to get the cash not grinding it ?

[3:21:20] VHD7: Id be willing to bet Octo/Kitty have more money than K (in terms of hard cash, not cash they are owed)
[3:21:42] killogic916: @VHD7 theres like 50 poeple that have more $$ than K
[3:21:44] UnknownT666: Lol when was the last time K made actually money that wasnt giving to him tbf

[3:22:25] SFGMOD: you getting way to close to the gas pumps for my liking KEKW
[3:22:36] Crazybro: just weaving around gas pumps LUL
[3:22:43] pmoonbuddy: The least Mr. K could do is let gomer save up money to buy his own rig, so everybody makes more money
[3:22:49] starkiller1786: kebunCG have two guns now so much can happen
[3:23:12] Lordbidwell: Thanks for the meta timmacTHUMB

[3:24:17] Lordbidwell: Still not the place.  We have a discord for meta people in chat want to find out in game not chat
[3:24:48] VHD7: Random question, but does OTT actually make songs still? I wanna say he mentioned working on one recently but idk if that was just a joke about grinders
[3:24:49] starkiller1786: @lordbidwell  talking about Mr k bank money is meta too
