[8:44:02] Grivvvy: so gotta give the drop fee
[8:44:02] Archaius: this text says basicly if you tow a car and the owner doesnt want to pay the drop fee then u have to drop for free @PENTA
[8:44:02] King_Nook: @PENTA if the owner isnt their. you are good. If told by police you are good. Etc

[8:44:09] blackinvador: the car will always be evidence of a crime (illegal parking) @PENTA
[8:44:09] Seriphax: if they can pay, basically
[8:44:10] ToastedRubber: So if the owner is present you can't impound it?? Wut ?
[8:44:11] Loremipsum21: or if it's the police telling you to impound it or if the vehicle is inoperable

[8:44:13] chancetheginger: a lot of words are poorly defined as well
[8:44:14] MnStrange: @penta If one of those 3 conditions are met you don't have to release it
[8:44:15] Yordleboi: not if 2 or 3 is true
[8:44:15] mackfitzg: you're still getting it wrong
[8:44:15] Kemli: here's the fun part. When in the tow process does the person have to be present.... at the start or during or end
[8:44:15] Rem753: @PENTA you get more money from the drop fee though

[8:44:17] wiggles3112: no police own the police car
[8:44:18] mountaindew9: who is the owner of a state vehicle?
[8:44:18] GT_Alex74: 3) is good, any car that's broken down has to be towed
[8:44:19] bgdrew: you have to offer the drop fee
[8:44:19] jiff_lol: do cops own their cars?
[8:44:20] covetid: you WANT the interaction with the driver
[8:44:20] dotaforprez: Does he own that car?
[8:44:20] klaatuNaatu: Point 3 is the big one: if the vehicle is reasonably considered unsafe, you can take it
[8:44:20] OtterFightingClub: True
[8:44:21] sir_redbeard: IT doesn't say it has to be released on the spot, just before impounding
[8:44:22] DoingBusiness: why does greco hate us
[8:44:23] ApathyEmbodied: Vehicle is evidence of a crime... unauthorized parking is a crime, right?
[8:44:24] BobRossSaladToss: does it mean the owner needs to be at the impound lot?
[8:44:24] glazedscronut: to the AG pepeRun
[8:44:26] MisterTohru: they have to pay the drop fee
[8:44:27] HelloPoxi: I think that part is wrong because i think if 2 is true then why would you drop the vehicle for 1
[8:44:27] CurseYeeDinkleberg: Its a blurb not the whole thing
[8:44:27] OmegaDanman: If you meet condition 2 or 3, then it doesn't matter if the owner is present or not
[8:44:27] Embernaut: Isn
[8:44:27] bugginpuppies: the second part is always true though

[8:44:31] stickyloaf: where is “there”? the tow yard???
[8:44:31] ThatLittleRedBird: I'm sure that's listed separately
[8:44:31] NO_REAS0N: So it's been changed.
[8:44:31] SoNatty247: what if the owner's there and it is also evidence
[8:44:31] ItsMeMattK: Cops DO NOT OWN thier patrol cars
[8:44:32] Meatyfrog: that first bit means it's better to get cops to pay the drop fee anyway
[8:44:32] Ele_Underscore: ur gonna want to reread the greco laws
[8:44:32] Cernem: That's not the full law, that is an exerpt
[8:44:32] waryenoh: thats for pd andems i think
[8:44:32] TheSweetTatertot: This says you have to drop it regardless. They dont have to pay.
[8:44:33] Hotot1: Doesn't say you can't tow to impound lot to verify ownership
[8:44:34] Jotzila: in the vicinity or within a few feet of the vehicle?
[8:44:34] cirCle_faCe: "obligated" isn't the strongest wording. i think it could be argued'
[8:44:34] thePeachSlice: Good for RP, you're required to talk to them if they're there
[8:44:34] Demosthenex: Obligated to offer to drop it

[8:44:44] donburittoe: the owner needs to be at the impound lot before you impound it PEPW
