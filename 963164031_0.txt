[0:47:23] Actual_Nicotine: Interval is going to be how often, ticks will be how many total ticks (ie duration)
[0:47:23] Kyndagh: Interval = Number of time between ticks. Ticks = Number of total ticks of damage. So Interval of 5 seconds, Ticks of 4, lasts 20 seconds and does damage 4 times

[0:55:37] Faraksiss: @UberHaxorNova How many times you would take the damage before it's out of your system
[0:55:38] toadloadmodechode: @DudleyIsDumb well, if I remember correctly, Quebec retained its French culture because the British didn't have the manpower to accept British culture and laws, they just sort of had to agree their new king was the British king
[0:55:39] villainousone: ticks = repetition of damage
[0:55:39] CherryPy: duration should be how long it last no?
[0:55:39] tally_one: NODDERS
[0:55:39] HyenaDip: Tick is how often you get "hit" with the damage.
[0:55:39] ItsOKaleigh: @UberHaxorNova ticks = how many times you take 50 damange
[0:55:40] Pepsiguy2009: jesus getting pulled over KEKLEO

[0:55:40] iiSUMMER_: ticks = amount of times you get damaged
[0:55:41] marvelo: tivck = dmg application
[0:55:42] DSrlaagyoenr: the ticks is how many times it does damage
[0:55:43] Gullerback: a tick is 2 seconds
[0:55:43] Maithiss: so you could make it potency 1 tick 100 times over 60 seconds
[0:55:43] dank_memes_kid: ticks is the damage hits @UberHaxorNova
[0:55:43] EricZombiexx: ticks is damage per sec

[0:55:47] NukesJ: 100 potency, 600 sec interval, 1-2 ticks. Delayed release insta-kill poison after 10 minutes
[0:55:47] lolbottle: ticks = number of times you take damage
[0:55:47] NovaJuice: Start with lower numbers?
[0:55:47] Zaliss: How many times the damage occurs
[0:55:47] ItsMyyyName: yes
[0:55:48] endurantee: 2 tics would be 2 time a damage procs

[0:55:49] Kyndagh: No
[0:55:50] pablo_4202: yes
[0:55:50] ekiMheT: so if 2 ticks = 2 50%
[0:55:50] HyenaDip: So 100 seconds. every 10 tics it hurts you for ____ damage.
[0:55:51] Actual_Nicotine: Azimuth has the correct definition
[0:55:51] LumberChopMan: seconds * ticks = duration
[0:55:51] PeachBottoms: the total # of times it does damage

[0:55:58] sunbrewed: it hit you twice, since it was 50 each you were down and out
[0:55:58] Buldge: No, 3 * 50
[0:55:58] mnk_tropic: so the second value is time taken per hit? third value is the amount oh hits taken?
[0:55:58] Francis5795: 2 50 ticks is 100

[0:56:03] vyian: by the 2nd tick u were already dead w/ 50 potency

[0:56:06] Jaco_Garci: A clock has 60 ticks
[0:56:06] commander_sweetie: Ticks means game ticks. how fast the game is moving? Think of a clock. one sec = 1 game tick
[0:56:07] jaymerka: It's the amount of % of potency before it ends
[0:56:07] ANDRO_core: So if you have 3 second intervals and 5 ticks you would get hit 5 times every 3 seconds @UberHaxorNova
[0:56:08] Snill_The_Undying: how many times it's hurts before it clear out of your system.

[0:56:10] marvelo: 1 2 3 tick 1 2 3 tick
[0:56:11] Fyrbo: @UberHaxorNova Potency=Dmg, Interval = time between Dmg taken, Ticks= Amount of times you take the Dmg
[0:56:11] MonsoonOwl: ticks must be how long it lasts
[0:56:11] Buldge: Yes
[0:56:11] alch2: you got hit by 50 damage 3 times because you had 3 ticks
[0:56:12] Kreiger: @UberHaxorNova Interval 600 seconds 10min until death

[0:56:12] Klax04: no
[0:56:12] blazinginferno24: yes

[0:56:14] ItsOKaleigh: NODDERS

[0:56:21] mizar_and_alcor: yes
[0:56:22] Foxe_fox: No 1 time every second
[0:56:22] icelikesrice: @UberHaxorNova you can totally do delayed insta kills, long ass interval with high potency

[0:56:22] miyagi210: yes
[0:56:23] Pepsiguy2009: try it with a 1 potency and play around with the other numbers KEKLEO
[0:56:23] LumberChopMan: yes
[0:56:24] IgnisBoy: yes
[0:56:24] grizzlyyyb: maybe
[0:56:24] Strikerpxs: Ticks are how many time the potency is applied, at the interval of seconds between hits
[0:56:24] Gizmopc: 1 damage 1 interval and 999 ticks
[0:56:25] Buldge: Chat stop saying no DESKCHAN

[0:56:25] x2penzx: yes u got hit for 50% hp 3 times
[0:56:26] Uberpwnageman: so 50 dmg 3 times over 3 seconds is what you set it as i think people are saying
[0:56:26] h0ud1n: OMEGALUL
[0:56:26] Rodolas: 10 potency, every 1 second, 10 times would drop you to 0 after 10 seconds
[0:56:26] CoolSemiObscureReference: I think it is first hit interval next hit interval next hit, the ticks are the amount of hits
[0:56:26] ekiMheT: the duality of chat
[0:56:26] Netherzapdos: yes no yes no uhnKek
[0:56:26] 144pjesus: Ticks, how long it'll last Potency the amount of damage, interval how often it damages

[0:56:28] notoriouspp: 10 damage 10 seconds 1 sec tick = 100dmg over 10 seconds
[0:56:29] selfDisgust: @UberHaxorNova say 5 ticks, at 1 interval. means it will hit you once every second, 5 times

[0:56:31] cvaga: RE WATCH CLIP
[0:56:31] cerealapii: KEKW
[0:56:32] nero_uchi: @UberHaxorNova so ticks is how many times you take the potency, intervals is how long between taking the damage from the ticks.

[0:56:36] staticburst: poisonmaster
[0:56:36] ErikaKat19: if you dont know, dont answer peepoWTF
[0:56:36] Faraksiss: @UberHaxorNova Yeah you got hit for 50% of your hp every 3 seconds until you've used up all your ticks
[0:56:37] AzimuthGames: Interval is how often it goes, TICKS is how many total times that interval happens
[0:56:37] juannari7: N OMEGALUL
[0:56:37] xcrash283x: hit once for 3 secs 3 times at 50 hp @UberHaxorNova
[0:56:38] RatInTrash: No, you got hit 3 times for 50 percent with 3 seconds in between each time you got hit
[0:56:39] reposaurus: You could have it where it starts like an hour after you drink it and have it do 100% damage@UberHaxorNova
[0:56:40] ZeroMoonGuard: I think that it's very cool that was whipped up and implemented so quickly
[0:56:40] oHazen_: uhnYou figure it out!
[0:56:40] SmokeyShnake: its like a dot
[0:56:41] RomeoFTB: gotta have that one guy
[0:56:41] UchihaIsR4born: uhnKek
[0:56:41] Esseraf: @uberhaxornova it’s how many individual hits it does so 3 ticks means it’ll hit you 3 different times
[0:56:42] maxspeed200: 50 damage 3 times over the span of 3 seconds
[0:56:42] HyenaDip: 600 second interval = 10 mins.
[0:56:42] DrZombieGamer: 1 1 36000 would be 1 dmg every second for an hour if i under stand how it was made @uberhaxornova
[0:56:44] cassdoodles: better off asking the dev who did it then chat KEKW
[0:56:45] Lotheye: @UberHaxorNova im guessing its so that you can make the death either gradual or fast for every tick.
[0:56:46] Alexlj92: just test it with less damage this time
[0:56:48] Kyndagh: We already did in discord KEKW
[0:56:48] Nightbot: We? modCheck I didn't see you in there. uhnHm Tell us what uhnYou are doing in NoPixel uhnNotes
[0:56:48] jaymerka: you only got hit twice because it was a potency of 50
[0:56:49] darkhorseman990: apparently you have 100 ticks of health, you set it to take 50 ticks per sec
[0:56:50] Senpai_Siid: All this puking siz will be skinny in no time
[0:56:50] electricpine: if you do 10 potency 10 seconds 6 ticks, lose 10 health every 10 seconds 6 times

[0:56:51] stukamod: NODDERS
[0:56:52] Plasticq: Actual Math KEKW
[0:56:52] Valaphar: potency=damage it will do each tick, seconds=time it takes to activate the damage, ticks=total instances of ticks it will do so 10-10-10 will do 100 damage each 10 seconds
[0:56:52] koffsyrup: its clearly RNG
[0:56:52] 144pjesus: Ticks how long it'll last, Potency the amount of damage, interval how often it damages
[0:56:52] slothbat_: tick = hit
[0:56:53] Echofear: if you put 100 ticks it would do damage every 3 seconds 100 times
[0:56:54] joyfoxx: pepoHmm IM ALREADY ON IT
[0:56:54] marvin2: if you want slow burn poison, you would want a high tick count

[0:57:00] zrialf: 1 tick would have only reduced 50 health
[0:57:00] Foxe_fox: ticks is how many times you are hit doing the duration. so 3 times. in 3 seconds is 1 tick every second
[0:57:00] possumwalsh1221: We’re trying peepoJuice

[0:57:07] toadloadmodechode: @DudleyIsDumb It's all good, I'd read up on Quebec's history, not Canada's, and they will respect you a lot more for it if you can use it.

[2:04:15] DudleyIsDumb: 10 minute interval with one tick at 100 damage, people randomly die uhnKek @uberhaxornova
[2:04:21] AzimuthGames: but the interval is already like that
[2:04:24] massive_legend420: understandable
[2:04:26] Supremagorious: It would catch too many people completely blind
[2:04:27] LarryFTW: hits them an hour later uhnKek
[2:04:28] ANDRO_core: depends on the RP
[2:04:29] ed__ed_: @uberhaxornova if you make it 3 seconds with 3 ticks, you have a delay of 3 seconds before the 1st effect kicks in pretty sure
[2:04:32] villainousone: its already set up like that with the interval
[2:04:35] Linkluckless: negative delay u can time travel
[2:04:35] ob4ke2k: Yeah seems powergame-y
[2:04:36] CoolSemiObscureReference: Yeah, you could have the hospital as a good civ customer
[2:04:37] LolReallyy: but what if they walk away for 10 seconds then BAM dropped dead
[2:04:37] RezaQ8: @UberHaxorNova Or after you see them eat it you say "You have 5 minutes to live"
[2:04:37] Lemon_GTH: hits them while someone hitting a bank
[2:04:39] ArJayHeart: it need a pop of or on screen effect
[2:04:41] NoNick1337: You can trick someone to drink slow-killing poison and then sell them an overpriced antidote.
[2:04:41] Gutterbean: unless you told them
[2:04:42] Blackerzez: as long as they have time to react
[2:04:42] ed__ed_: @uberhaxornova it happened the first time
[2:04:42] Div_the_Penguin: well better than getting hit suddenly with 100
[2:04:43] Tribeam17: ooc: uhh i randomly died KEKW
[2:04:46] Teddarcheese: swim swim swwiiiiiiiim
[2:04:48] Diabetic_Menace: Put a 2 hour delay and they won't understand how they got downed
[2:04:49] Roppip: I feel like a lot of this relies on you being careful with it in RP and I feel like you will
[2:04:49] GhostBabyAlien8: Unless you tell them
[2:04:49] Alexlj92: maybe a 5th line that has an optional first delay?
[2:04:52] B1gwile: if you put like +3mins
[2:04:53] NovaJuice: depends on the situation i guess
[2:04:54] Ultimatestrife: yeah you can already do that
[2:04:58] tally_one: i meant in the sense that you tell someone in torture they are going to die in 5 min and they see it rather then insta drop
[2:04:58] Roppip: Can't just start pushing it to everyone
[2:04:59] raydryak: I feel like that would be the point of the poison though, no?
[2:05:00] DudleyIsDumb: Yeah the only one it’s okay to have it randomly kill is Flippy NODDERS @uberhaxornova
[2:05:01] YewW0TM8: Maximum of 5 minute delay?
[2:05:02] ArJayHeart: if they add an effect or a pop up message
[2:05:03] ReAnalyze: I think the heal kit is like -1 1 25
[2:05:06] ASomewhatLargeBabyRhino: I think that's why you have control of it, to vet what people are asking for @UberHaxorNova
[2:05:11] Poehler_Bear: As long as you give them a warning of how long they have it should be fine. "You got 2 hours before the poison enters your bloodstream" Something like that
[2:05:13] Namelessjoker: Just be like, "Today you will die.  Could be in seconds, could be in hours."
[2:05:14] KazzM8K: I guess you could call them right before the effect is supposed to kick in
[2:05:14] villainousone: if you do 10 seconds with like 10 ticks...each interval will be 10 seconds
[2:05:15] RezaQ8: Thats why the people that buy it must be trusted people
[2:05:15] pee_poopbutt: Just needs a message for when you eat shitty food too so people don’t get sus
[2:05:15] HyenaDip: Like Rob.
[2:05:16] AzimuthGames: because its controlled by you, you can make rules about how long people can have a delay, and tell them only if X
[2:05:18] xcurryricex: NODDERS
[2:05:19] straw_glasses: or it could be a "you have 24 hours to find the antidote" sort of deal uhnNotes

[2:05:24] TenekiTV: Rob KEKW
[2:05:28] wondervviener: NODDERS
[2:05:28] Gemblar: if there was some status text like "you don't feel too good" before the poison kicks in it could help that

[2:05:30] robbers12345: SAW RP JamesPog

[2:31:35] ninjapenjuinLIVE: @UberHaxorNova maybe talk to the doctor that gave barry tits, he might be down to help with that since he loves siz
[2:31:39] DudleyIsDumb: @zalothh I mean most don’t. Cyanide poisoning and ricin poisoning are the most common but cyanide poisoning doesn’t have a direct antidote

[3:23:19] xtrememayhem: getting it out there for popularity would be best - then when someone complains that its poison you give one that has no potency
[3:23:23] EarPen15: russian roulette cocktail perhaps, make it in the back and roll a dice on whether it damages or not

[3:25:59] 420thMagicMan: As long as it sells more than mixed drinks it is still worth it
[3:26:01] Roppip: I feel like a slow tick that takes away like 15% health would be enough of a novelty for people to buy
[3:26:04] KaridonKaar: Will managers like Kian have to know about it to restock it if you made the bartenders sell the non leathal one?

[10:23:18] HyenaDip: I can see people using poison waters as a cyanide pill mehdiLAUGH
[10:23:20] Echofear: I wonder if the poison leaves evidence already or not
[10:23:28] plazzerr: @KingPresiden yeah, but he was told ic, right? watching a clip of that would still be meta how?
[10:23:29] LijeBaley: @twilightpink At least they got to be 7 Raven. Next time they gotta be snails JamesPog
[10:23:36] graydaemon: @HyenaDip I'll take it a step further "hey can I have a sandwich" "sure here u go" dies. Sues for damages.

[10:24:20] invaderzim64387: Can someone explain tonight’s stream?
[10:24:22] HyenaDip: You reckon someone would sue another person for getting poisoned by them. how could they prove it?
[10:24:33] citruswedge: @Natcheetos seems like it was treated like scuff
[10:24:36] karrotkake0: Poison SZN @invaderzim64387

[10:25:00] Bier_und_Bratwurst: how many seasons does this series have so far saabHmm
[10:25:04] graydaemon: @HyenaDip No no, think about it.. You have the poison item on you and get someone to give you a nonpoisoned. You eat the nonpoisoned and the poisoned quickly and then blame the person for trying to poison you >:D
[10:25:13] graydaemon: EZ lawsuit.
[10:25:16] syneesia: Imagine if you can have a setting where it doesn't get removed after getting downed, actual ICU RP monkaW
[10:25:19] leightones: i think pushing the idea that the 24/7 just sells spoiled shit sometimes would be good for the rp in the long run
[10:25:20] GumbyMMA: @Bier_und_Bratwurst just one, the uhnSuffer season
[10:25:31] PvtKrunch: imagine replacing the food from bugershot with poison burgers

[10:25:39] plazzerr: @KingPresiden ohh ok, i didnt hear that, sorry
[10:25:48] Natcheetos: I think there needs to be a label like “you feel sick” so people don’t treat as scuff
[10:25:52] OAFox: u got them jawns playa
[10:25:59] fire_imunkey: you could easily frame burger shot of poisoning too
[10:25:59] kura1kura: omg, saying that you ate stuff from the 24/7 would make great RP. 24/7 food is trash, don't buy it.
[10:26:05] syneesia: 5Head
[10:26:08] graydaemon: @Natcheetos Nah make it a little not obvious. "Something isn't right..."

[10:53:31] ArJayHeart: @UberHaxorNova 0.3 evry second its about the same dmg has before but it look like a degen
[10:53:37] Echofear: a fun way to poison people is by robbing them and replacing their food

[10:53:58] BrandyPapi: @echofear yikes
[10:54:04] Boogihead: I feel like the moment someone mentions meta the chat should get emote only mode for like 20 minutes.
[10:54:05] AleArtStuff: a clean and healthy RP  with no meta ? thats a dream
[10:54:10] Div_the_Penguin: can you go with less then a second btw ?

[10:54:32] iiSUMMER_: i would do like, 2, 10, 100+ .. see how something like that looks
[10:54:32] 3xevilx: they are trying to say that the dmg is too high and is super chunky on the health bar i think
[10:54:34] h0neybadgerz: hes saying .3 damage per second is the dps i think
