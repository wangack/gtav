[5:30:48] inus2: like magazine, bullets, etc all cost more coin
[5:30:51] lblvckmvgicl: @inus2 yee thats why its not really priority
[5:31:18] zeman94: Plus you have to do the ammunation jobs for gun parts

[9:35:32] LolmanScott: yeah but that's nerd stuff sadKEK
[9:35:38] Apron__: 1 is like... okay maybe this can go somewhere and then 2 shows up
[9:35:42] AdamElJefe: I'm not going to going to go into a tirade about it, but we did catch a scene of Sokka wearing Air Force Ones in a wide shot KEKW
[9:35:44] whyiamso: Best moments imo were Zuko and Iroh focused
[9:35:47] AdamElJefe: go*
[9:35:58] whyiamso: The best episode was written by the OG showrunners!
[9:36:37] jhester23: I'm of the firm belief not everything needs a live action version
[9:36:47] jdblue: they are doing something they are interested in
[9:36:59] jdblue: which is trying to get $$$$$$
[9:37:00] Apron__: one of the actors reported that they thought they were auditioning for Avatar with the blue people OMEGALUL
[9:37:01] ash_huntr: ah im afraid its gonna be like Witcher tho, when they want according to the lore. Henry cavill was a good witcher
[9:37:10] Madam_Orange: yeah, honestly even if they had done a perfect live action version, im of a mind the show is just much better suited for animation
[9:37:13] LolmanScott: yeah but mainstream saw it was popular on netflix
[9:38:26] whyiamso: Oh Ken Leung haha he played Zhao
[9:38:30] Apron__: also the bending looks/feels more like video game moves than martial arts
[9:38:59] Apron__: Sifu Kisu was nowhere to be seen OMEGALUL
[9:39:03] AdamElJefe: yeah, the bending stances look so bad
[9:39:34] whyiamso: @AdamElJefe needa rewatch the m night movie if you thought the netflix series stances looked bad lol
[9:39:36] LolmanScott: like back dash three times to charge a super attack?

[9:40:29] Madam_Orange: NODDERS
[9:40:30] AdamElJefe: I'm so hyped for the Kyoshi movie
[9:40:40] Apron__: @LolmanScott first 5 minutes earthbending move is like he is charging up an ability and gets interrupted during cast KEKW
[9:40:40] whyiamso: I tortured myself and rewatched it before starting series...just so I could appreciate it more lol
[9:40:49] Madam_Orange: yo kyoshi savage af
[9:40:49] LolmanScott: I just want an Iroh/white lotus anthology
[9:41:16] LolmanScott: @Apron__ damn needs to wear more green to reduce the cast time
[9:41:26] Apron__: trueeeee
[9:41:41] AdamElJefe: I loved the Avatar Day scene when Aang is being accused of killing Chen and they're denying that Kiyoshi did it, but then Kiyoshi just shows up and was like, "yeah I did that hit" KEKW
[9:42:35] LolmanScott: or just a day in the life of a earth kingdom noble trying to resist the brain washing in ba sing se
[9:43:09] Apron__: idc so much if you have to speedrun story beats, but when there are out of order beat or even beats that were never there in the first place, it's not good lmao
[9:43:41] Apron__: so yeah lets watch it soon bestieee :)))))
[9:44:03] whyiamso: After Avatar and Percy Jackson...I'm kinda over shows/remakes with child actors, they just lack the ability to not come off wooden or not up to snuff

[9:49:34] Thrath: Wait I think its when you are searching
[9:49:42] FaultyModule: I don't envy him, ending that story, especially in the manner he's writing it, is gotta be extremely hard
[9:49:47] Thrath: Yeah it is

[9:53:03] Random_Slacker: didnt look like it was the same now though, so maybe removed the status of it
[9:53:09] Thrath: It could be a new thing to encourage people to stay in the sewers for rep before immediately searching for stuff
