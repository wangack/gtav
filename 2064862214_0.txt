[1:58:36] JoeayIV: explain Madge
[1:58:47] tarukryl: cimmanim
[1:59:03] evergreentyr: Because Cinnamon is made from ice cubes dyed red.
[1:59:11] JoeayIV: WHAT???
[1:59:27] evergreentyr: Its science
[1:59:27] sunmoonburn: huuuh?
[1:59:46] ShiftyD84: @JoeayIV if YOU refuse to google it, why should I google it/
[1:59:55] JoeayIV: um
[2:00:05] JoeayIV: well i was hoping someone would know
[2:00:07] ThatSoKyuRo: it‚Äôs a dust that‚Äôs why Kappa @joeayiv
[2:00:09] DEAD_P1XL: Technically putting anything in your coffee makes it cool faster if it absorbs some heat.
[2:00:11] JoeayIV: and we both wouldn't have to google
[2:00:19] JoeayIV: well okay consider this
[2:00:22] MintBrando: @JoeayIV i think you might be insane, i cant think of any chemical reactions. other than absorbing the heat
[2:00:32] cpstyxx: Just put the cinnamon in the microwave and then add it to your coffee what's the worst that could happen
[2:00:36] JoeayIV: its all in the same cup and all put in at the same time
[2:01:01] DJayEnzyme: i assume it increases surface area allowing for faster cooling
[2:01:09] JoeayIV: it shouldn't cool so quick in this thermos
[2:01:23] Jonishush: Peets in city hall PepoDance
[2:01:23] JoeayIV: but no cinnamon it stays hot for hours!
[2:01:24] DEAD_P1XL: The thermos might just have lost its vacuum
[2:01:33] JoeayIV: i just tested it!!!!!
[2:01:44] JoeayIV: no cinnamon and it stayed hot for longer!!!!
[2:01:51] DEAD_P1XL: maybe the first test saturated the thermos with heat and the second cooled slower
[2:01:59] ThatSoKyuRo: just re heat it then LUL
[2:02:04] Chiracho: @JoeayIV i need a means tested paper with times n shit Kappa
[2:02:10] JoeayIV: there has been a day in between coffees!!!
[2:02:18] DEAD_P1XL: maybe the cooling fairies really like cinnamon so they were more attracted to that
[2:02:21] JoeayIV: well i just have the stopwatch times on my phone
[2:02:29] JoeayIV: took 4 hours to cool today
