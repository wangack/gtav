[5:41:04] Loremipsum21: @Cerbivision You can frisk for RS. RS is all that's needed for a detainment and you can frisk during a detainment. You need PC for search though.
[5:41:12] FoldupGorilla: life in prison Madge
[5:41:13] xfactorbigdaddy: chat I’m oblivious, is there a mechanic for smelling weed or is it all rp?

[5:42:09] xfactorbigdaddy: appreciate it chat lolol
[5:42:10] Jonnen_: not 76 Sadge
[5:42:12] SturmSauer: in MD However, they may not use the smell of cannabis, without more, as probable cause to arrest and/or search an individual without a warrant. In addition, after a vehicle traffic stop, the smell of cannabis is sufficient probable cause to search a vehicle, but not the vehicle’s occupants.
[5:42:14] holyknightgoldan: @tmalles yeah, initially
[5:42:14] kdubbz66: I got my car searched when I smelled like weed lmao it is for sure real

[6:41:44] fatpaulie91: I just want Joy to blue ball me 5 times before the actual conclusion
[6:41:45] ApathyEmbodied: Judge Joy usually gives the manic roller coaster of a summary.

[6:41:56] SycoChris: I am never right
[6:41:56] xRageModeEngagedx: Does a frisk even show drugs? Why would you frisk if you weren't looking for weapons
[6:41:56] mezzanoon: we should bet on how many howevers or otherwises

[6:42:03] Tocho540: personally if I was a cop and smelled a weeder I would simply shoot them in the head
[6:42:03] ShrimpCommander: pentawBeef get ready
[6:42:03] shootslikeaninja: what's the point of smelling it if you can't use it
[6:42:04] Kevin_3D: Bro I'm never right
[6:42:04] RDKi: Whatever Penta says is correct
[6:42:05] DirtyDanFromDiscord: i think a lot of them do
[6:42:08] Rettroghost: @GayHibiscus Stare literally rotting ur brain
[6:42:08] Jitizm12301: Ya i think just weapons
[6:42:09] TehJoker14780: I bet he didn't even need to ask that question. He's just setting you on the rollercoaster @PENTA
[6:42:10] Zefalon: @LordTomoyoshi except for every other message you send :P
[6:42:15] CaptainKoma: If they say you have to take out a camera and take pictures... pentawPP
[6:42:15] UntaPup: duckass This shows up when you frisk
[6:42:15] Catheter_Carl: Clearly chat is better at RP
[6:42:16] Nankuse: if this an L people made so many points LUL
[6:42:16] tmalles: they should add a pat down option
[6:42:17] Cerbivision: you only frisk for weapon in real life too
[6:42:18] RainyReveries: idk :)
[6:42:21] MisterTohru: i would hope the big bags of weed show up on frisk
[6:42:22] sterowentUS: a smell is probable cause, isn't it? that's a physical thing, the scent of weed
[6:42:22] taeped: @TehJoker14780 that would be funny
[6:42:23] Loremipsum21: It would be really stupid if things like oxy and joints showed up in the frisk mechanic
[6:42:24] WingsDub: what about that time you said kermodo lost the cook off
[6:42:24] aWorldsoFullofLove: I just came in what happened
[6:42:28] DXHULK: If smell isn't PC than eyesight isn't PC
[6:42:29] Tokanowa: Deliberation gonna give me an aneurysm
[6:42:34] jistbug: Leave before you find out
[6:42:34] holyknightgoldan: @aWorldsoFullofLove terrorism
[6:42:36] oddlighting: weed doesn't have a distinctive feel
[6:42:36] GreyGryphon: chat doesnt call it because they say both yes and no.. lol
[6:42:39] Chunko_Muffo: Federally Weed smell is PC, a state needs an intervening law or clause -- San Andreas you built probably doesn't have one
[6:42:44] Proxemious: I voted L but I think this will be a W
[6:42:48] Loremipsum21: no it's PC
[6:42:49] mezzanoon: what the hell
[6:42:49] holyknightgoldan: true false true false
[6:42:49] brontoflorist: NODDERS RS not PC

[6:42:52] BigKeldo: more of a spiritual thing
[6:42:52] mackfitzg: it's PC
[6:42:53] Selreth: Should have bet on how many howevers joy will roll up and down
[6:42:54] Love4donuts: no it's PC
[6:42:54] mezzanoon: gordo tall
[6:42:56] Kemli: fuck man
[6:42:57] MisterTohru: google says its PC Nerdge @PENTA
[6:42:58] GreyGryphon: it would be PC if a dog smelled it apparently?
[6:42:58] KiHaShin: the problem is that probably non cops don't know that frisk only shows weapons in this server ...
[6:43:01] Pramado: It's PC in a traffic stop in some steps
[6:43:04] Loremipsum21: it's literally PC in every state where marijuana is illegal
[6:43:08] Pramado: states
[6:43:08] ShrimpCommander: PEPW if sense of smell is equal to sight then...
[6:43:11] Cerbivision: yeah
[6:43:13] Beenk: did wrangler ever get his the text he asked for
[6:43:16] Drivont: smell is still technically subjective
[6:43:16] eolrv: heh. still a w EZ
[6:43:17] ItsMeMattK: Because of the 10-37, it was PC
[6:43:17] CrazyLikeSwayze: "Your honor the K9 smelled weed." "Did other witnesses on scene also smell weed??"
[6:43:18] Pramado: It's not PC in California though
[6:43:20] Zaaltyr: its also burnt weed vs raw weed smell too
[6:43:20] packofmisfits: the call is important I feel
[6:43:22] Xsanity: why would you get a dwi?
[6:43:26] Loremipsum21: If it's RS then you can't legally search
[6:43:29] Spikee439: smell sight doctrine
[6:43:31] Nightbot: Most recent vod: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtSVoBxVvimjoDi6FilXNzA
[6:43:31] SirSaltyBacon: @Pramado Weed is legal in california, not in los santos lmao
[6:43:31] TheTenseTurtle: I’d think it’s pc because it was suspicious call and the odor coming off the person
[6:43:33] PimicTV: I think because the server says weed is illegal then the odor will count as PC
[6:43:35] Shibousha: Gordo is like if Samwise left the Shire and took a life of crime.
[6:43:35] Kemli: there's a whole damn mechanic for a reason, it's hard to see that shit in game vs real life
[6:43:36] brontoflorist: I think its RS but who knows I've been smoking and growing weed legally in a sane state for a decade EZ
[6:43:38] Coltronn_: why i never smoked in my car. dumb ass friends would hot box their cars
[6:43:40] Ele_Underscore: how is the smell of weed not PC in a state where it is illegal
[6:43:40] Miditron6000: @pramado Well weed is legal in ca
[6:43:41] Tokanowa: I was freaking a black n mild once and got pulled out my car cus they thought I was smokin a blunt
[6:43:42] fatpaulie91: smelling marijuana is a typical thing most cops use to search peoples cars or persons.
[6:43:42] Rettroghost: Shruge
[6:43:43] Bulfwyne: KEKW
[6:43:47] wrenridinghood: @loremipsum21 it's PC in all but a few states
[6:43:49] odaidai: People hang around smokers but don't smoke and can pass a drugs test. They aren't getting a DUI.
[6:43:49] Cerbivision: KEKW
[6:43:50] KalboEagle: Weedge no im not
[6:43:50] Bulfwyne: hello chat ...
[6:43:50] luladblock: SNIFFA smells like cocaine

[6:43:57] DirtyDanFromDiscord: wouldnt they need to blood test you
[6:43:57] Zefalon: @Ele_Underscore dont argue with the animals
[6:43:58] Pramado: @SirSaltyBacon I know, I was saying in general
[6:43:58] GrumpyTrashPanda: Weedge no u
[6:43:59] Hobo: speculation

[6:44:05] Seas: yet
[6:44:06] dubdijon: depends if its legal in the state
[6:44:10] TheWarReadyGaming: Then again 70 Joints is a Felony
[6:44:19] Ele_Underscore: @Zefalon I got that dawg in me too Madge
[6:44:22] Xsanity: in irl wouldnt they have to prove that you were high tho
[6:44:22] RyuShinden: also only a few people RP that they're high
[6:44:24] Chunko_Muffo: Weed isn't something you black/white test for, so if there is circumstantial evidence like smell and red eyes you are cooked
[6:44:25] Bulfwyne: oh so its a "Prong" kinda thing of like 2 or 3 other prongs needed to prove ?
[6:44:26] Kemli: this can't be bad or it just fucks it all
[6:44:29] supercheeseweasel: not trying to be one of those guys penty but the supreme court has decided that just a smell isnt enough to further search
[6:44:37] gibsox: is there a weed breathalizer irl?
[6:44:37] memerdub024: no lmao
[6:44:39] Zefalon: @Ele_Underscore thats true, you are a chatter
[6:44:40] mackfitzg: no lol
[6:44:41] badonkaboots5: nope
[6:44:42] GreyGryphon: @PENTA isnt open bottles of beer legal cause to search a car for cops?
[6:44:42] Nankuse: you would think but no
[6:44:42] Bulfwyne: its hard to prove that :D
[6:44:42] CptMathias: they have tests now
[6:44:43] Cerbivision: it cant be legal in the state its federally illegal
[6:44:43] mezzanoon: whats a drug test PEPW
[6:44:43] huccilol: what about 2nd hand smoke og
[6:44:43] UglyCretin: PEPW
[6:44:44] Huso833: hard to prove with weed
[6:44:44] soVisceral: 75 joints is felony is crazy to me. that’s a TON of joints
[6:44:45] shootslikeaninja: could get em to add eyes look red and blodshot to the smell mechanic
[6:44:46] Spikee439: blood test?
[6:44:48] Pat_Dubbie: the problem is they literally can't
[6:44:48] roadkills0s: fuck. no.
[6:44:49] Coltronn_: PEPW
[6:44:49] odaidai: Arrest first ask questions later.
[6:44:51] Chunko_Muffo: Nope, science hasn't figured that out really
[6:44:52] sterowentUS: the only high RP i've seen is by hippie. no one makes it obvious
[6:44:53] Loremipsum21: Maybe in court they would have to prove it not to charge you though
[6:44:54] Bulfwyne: you HAVE to do the pee test
[6:44:54] Nankuse: Cops aint gonna do that shit
[6:44:55] FGradePlay: Swab test can last days
[6:44:56] Asai22: weedalyzer
[6:44:56] BluntAgent: they are not reliable at all
[6:45:01] Bulfwyne: otherwise
[6:45:02] Kclark24: nope
[6:45:04] blackinvador: @supercheeseweasel your weed case won't make it to federal level lmao
[6:45:04] roadkills0s: they just go "hmm lokks high book him"
[6:45:05] Oushu: they do swabs still at Amazon Warehouses
[6:45:06] Vanderic: They pit a bag of cheetos in front of you
[6:45:06] Nankuse: A cops word is worth waaaay more than a general persons too
[6:45:08] TheTenseTurtle: marijuana stays in your system to long
[6:45:09] CptMathias: they check your eyes and the back of your throat
[6:45:10] holyknightgoldan: they do blood tests now
[6:45:10] ApathyEmbodied: Kid blew a 0.0 for DUI then got charged as being high after he passed field sobriety tests.
[6:45:13] Tzazi: theres a video of this guy who blew a 0.00 and you can see it in the cops bodycam that he blew it, and then the cops like "you smell like weed" and still arrested him
[6:45:14] freedomboy696969: technically an FBI agent or DEA agent can arrest you for federal possesion charges, it just never happens @PENTA
[6:45:14] Tzazi: OMEGALUOL
[6:45:15] Red_Sava: NOPPERS too expensive
[6:45:18] tontheilie: I used to administer those tests for my job and tested myself like 30 seconds after smoking weed and tested negative lol
[6:45:20] Tzazi: yeah @ApathyEmbodied ayyyy
[6:45:21] GetTwoBirdsStonedAtOnce: if you get a dui for weed, that's pretty much GG
[6:45:22] red_zync0112: i think you can request a blood test
[6:45:26] Gouramis3: there’s a blood test and it picks up basically any the you’ve had for months
[6:45:31] Rettroghost: PauseChamp and oushu ?
[6:45:31] Xsanity: they should make you piss on the spot
[6:45:31] ApathyEmbodied: @Tzazi He's suing now after he's won.
[6:45:34] GreyGryphon: The odor of marijuana alone does not amount to probable cause to conduct a warrantless search of the vehicle but, rather, may be considered as a factor in examining the totality of the circumstances
[6:45:35] dotaforprez: They use blacklight on your tongue
[6:45:36] mackfitzg: might have to appeal that if it's the case LOL
[6:45:42] mezzanoon: imma watch this in the meantime https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KivOhtYuxeU

[6:45:53] Loremipsum21: I grew up in NC where cops will 100% toss your car apart if they smell weed
[6:45:53] FGradePlay: I thought if they smelled like weed you immediately shoot them Shruge
[6:45:55] Kemli: I mean its a game, there are limitations
[6:45:55] SevesseK: lol
[6:45:56] Chunko_Muffo: It would be very fucking stupid if another species smelling weed gives PC and a human smelling weed doesn't give PC
[6:45:57] RainyReveries: KEKL
[6:45:57] FlGJAM: she really is
[6:45:57] mezzanoon: PEPW maybe
[6:45:58] Kemli: fuck that
[6:45:58] Nankuse: Wrangler shows up for 20 minutes and makes it so cops cant search weed suspects anymore Kappa
[6:45:58] AsiianKid: stake out and have to catch them in the act?
[6:46:00] Soffeli: it was funny though Shruge

[6:46:37] TunaThyme: she needs a little bit of help thats all
[6:46:37] mackfitzg: she's just handing free arguments to the defense at that point
[6:46:41] Electo: Electo subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 34 months! 
[6:46:42] Warjec: how many objections were there

[6:46:59] AntiqueWhiskey: Does abbi know about "Shut the fuck up Friday"?  haha! :)
[6:47:00] aWorldsoFullofLove: Has abi even tried to pretend
[6:47:02] Proxemious: @Rettroghost D8 is bad, thca good
[6:47:03] Zefalon: @odaidai yikes
[6:47:04] Moonsknight: Her point was to drive home that the search was legal, whether he had weed or not, but that's not the point she needs to make
[6:47:04] AyeAyeRon41: PENTUP BRICK SQUAAAADDDDDD
[6:47:05] ApathyEmbodied: EH at least it's on a case that doesn't matter.
[6:47:10] Cerbivision: you shouldnt have cuz the mfer smelled of weeds

[6:47:18] exhume125: If you smell like weed you better have a fkn gun so I can charge u
[6:47:23] Josh600: could have just lied like all the other cops do
[6:47:25] captainshtbox: PEPW
[6:47:28] Huso833: The fact that weed is illegal should make it in your favor
[6:47:29] Loremipsum21: It shouldn't matter
[6:47:30] tmalles: frisking them helps, cops don't yank stuff out of pockets and a frisk wouldn't hurt j
[6:47:33] GreyGryphon: Is it for K9?
[6:47:33] Chunko_Muffo: Only species that can't communicate with human language can give you PC from a smell would be very stupid
[6:47:33] fatpaulie91: He probably wanted to just make sure if he was going to be ruling on whether or not it was PC for search or if you just frisked.

[6:47:43] ImARealHopper: gotta throw all those dogs away Sadge
[6:47:43] lzgoalie35: pentawPain can I smell you for officer safety?
[6:47:45] Loremipsum21: The entire point of the smelling mechanic is for cops to get PC

[6:47:52] Tzazi: sneeze5K9 wtf
[6:47:53] m_Gordon: Not sure why people keep suggesting you should frisk someone for smelling like weed. A frisk wouldn't tell you if they have drugs or not
[6:47:54] Oushu: @Proxemious I've been on THCA lately, it's with delta 9 I think?

[6:48:15] manzri: even though you can do something, you just need to take the safety precautions
[6:48:16] jistbug: then its all so mechincal
[6:48:17] Huso833: Invade that man's pockets
[6:48:17] captainshtbox: NOOO BUT THE JAPANESE MAN IN A SUIT UNIT
[6:48:18] SturmSauer: in MD dogs can smell weed but cops cannot
[6:48:20] the_fayth: Was there a K9 unit on scene with this one chat?
[6:48:24] Zefalon: @Oushu jesus christ, weed weebs?!
[6:48:25] tmalles: @m_Gordon because a cop will still frisk for their safety
[6:48:26] TehJamJar: right but he’s not allowed to have it so would have been an immediate arrest
[6:48:29] ItsMeMattK: Madge Weeders shouldnt have any rights
[6:48:32] Zefalon: @Oushu give me a break
[6:48:32] Nightbot: To know when Penta goes live or what he is doing on his days off go drop him a follow on twitter: https://twitter.com/PENTA_live

[6:48:35] ravoman: The wrangler vs cummin case law
[6:48:39] Warjec: in a car it would be
[6:48:43] anextremeemo: in the state of LS yeah
[6:48:51] Oushu: @Zefalon every person has a vice
[6:48:54] Huso833: If it would be in a car then it should be on a person no Susge
[6:48:54] HawkeyePierce: if a K9 unit doesn't have any purpose, is it ok to shoot them? asking for a friend
[6:48:54] ApathyEmbodied: @ravoman How fucked would it be just to make him innocent to get a funny case law name?
[6:48:55] JTVham: if the smell of weed is not PC, then why do they have drug dogs?
[6:48:56] MisterTohru: its physical
[6:48:57] Loremipsum21: Is public intoxication a crime on ONX?
[6:48:58] the_fayth: I don't think it would affect the K9 unit then, it would just be an extra step of calling them
[6:49:01] BigKeldo: @the_fayth no but wranger got that dog him
[6:49:03] holyknightgoldan: it's an illegal substance if you smell it then you have to check for it at least.
[6:49:05] Bulfwyne: NODDERS @TehJamJar yee and thats what Rossa was arguing earlier in the cells
[6:49:05] CrazyLikeSwayze: good precedent to set in court
[6:49:06] mezzanoon: im kinda nervous he's takin a hwile
[6:49:07] red_zync0112: was he hiding the rifle in his pants kekw
[6:49:07] boolove: it depends if its in a car during a traffic stop
[6:49:09] odaidai: I've been pulled over in Austin multiple times smelling of weed. Never had an issue.
[6:49:09] TehJamJar: @warjec been good seeing you around man 👋🏻
[6:49:10] Spikee439: DWI?
[6:49:10] GreyGryphon: Smell of weed can be used as evidence but not alone is it enough for probable cause IIRC
[6:49:11] wminimart: "Weed is illegal, however..."
[6:49:12] Huso833: pitDMX
[6:49:13] fatpaulie91: @Warjec why would it matter if it was in a car if the state has it as illegal to carry not just drive.
[6:49:15] Tzazi: sneeze5K9
[6:49:15] supercheeseweasel: @PENTA what's the worst you've been rights violated?
[6:49:16] Miditron6000: Everyone will need a k9
[6:49:17] huccilol: pentawPug
[6:49:18] mackfitzg: it's gonna be not guilty because abby brought up other people being around OMEGALUOL

[6:49:21] KiHaShin: the fact that youneed to frisk to see a hunting rifle is a bit odd too , you can only work with what you can in a game
[6:49:21] Zaaltyr: Drug dogs to attack dogs LUL
[6:49:21] RyuShinden: Search for hiding people?
[6:49:23] tv_ennui: I think 'it depends' as I can imagine instances where it seems like PC, and others where it's more dubious.
[6:49:23] Herman_Miller_1114: if you’re supposed to frisk first, which wouldn’t find drugs, and just go straight to search, what’s the point of the frisk?
[6:49:25] Shibousha: What about K10?
[6:49:26] oddlighting: what does the smell of weed when frisking feel like?
[6:49:27] winter__st0rm: Yeah there's Ripley style of K9 and Nova stlye of K9
[6:49:29] tv_ennui: Like, can you search everyone coming out of a concert?

[6:49:35] mezzanoon: we'll find out
[6:49:38] Kathula: He got ping too
[6:49:38] Ele_Underscore: in the context you had probable cause
[6:49:38] Zaaltyr: You also got the dispatch call of sus activity
[6:49:40] Dart44: WRANGLER KILLS K9...Department
[6:49:42] mezzanoon: it should be enough imo
[6:49:43] BluntAgent: and you know, the weed
[6:49:44] GreyGryphon: @PENTA that might be enough then?
[6:49:45] sven_snusberg1990: he also had weed on him
[6:49:45] Bulfwyne: If you smell like shit ... you prolly got shit on you KEKW
[6:49:46] Cerbivision: alone it is
[6:49:51] iLizard_King: in florida, smell now means nothing.
[6:49:56] morbid__corvid: I could totally see a cop irl say that because the driver sprayed some fragrance in their car was an effort to cover the smell of weed
[6:49:56] Tokanowa: All day
[6:49:57] Chunko_Muffo: People keep googling shit from the states with medical/recreational
[6:49:59] nottuned: i got searched for smelling like weed.... I had no weed

[6:50:05] packofmisfits: you are 100 getting your shit searched if you smell like weed

[6:50:09] ghostfacekillah17: can we get a poll on how many times judge says however
[6:50:12] Shake4L: Sounds illegal
[6:50:15] Nankuse: They're gonna rip your seats out and then not find anything and say Fuck You
[6:50:16] nasirum: just dont smell like drugs 4head
[6:50:16] odaidai: Again never had an issue smelling like weed being pulled over in Austin.
[6:50:18] freedomboy696969: the judge is british too, weed is super illegal in the UK lol
