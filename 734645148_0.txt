[0:34:50] dotzaq: What if you were able to pick who takes it next?
[0:34:53] StratoTom: I think Koil sees you a bit as "the drugs admin", so if you really have an issue with who's running it, he will listen to you.
[0:34:56] RezaQ8: @UberHaxorNova Koil did fix a bunch of the scuffed pings though so there has been more drug sales pings which has meant more people been getting caught selling coke

[0:35:01] SamTheManOG: uhnThonk
[0:35:04] BBUKAKE: ALSO, i feel that might promote people to not do that risky RP - as people would like to keep the whitelist right?
[0:35:05] fotdaymon: yeah tru gotta be responsible
[0:35:07] jpizzle3201: could also encourage outing whielists for the spite of doing it

[0:35:16] Bizzyscrew: it makes sense thi
[0:35:17] thriftyarmpit: well, a big thing is to do what your boss for coke did when you got the position, like, setting up for your protege or something
[0:35:23] syneesia: Encourages people to be lazy just to not get caught
[0:35:24] crosshairs111: put the white list on a rotation of x months. then it switches off

[0:36:24] thriftyarmpit: i personally don't think there is TOO much to worry about because you have a good mindset about this
[0:36:25] Rtik: If you get caught you have to be broken out for coke to be brought back to the city for it to then be handed down to someone else
[0:36:28] DRspector: pablo escobar created great rp by getting caught like 3 times @UberHaxorNova
[0:36:33] Ramm725: Everyone knows that dead drops are the way to go. Kappa
[0:36:34] eddisxxn: I feel like that could be abused where people would purposely out the connect so they can lose the whitelist
[0:36:54] DSrlaagyoenr: theres also levels of getting caught, if you just get caught doing handoffs its not all out, but if you are caught producing the product, then its all out
[0:36:55] Rtik: And the breakout would be a mission rather than a standard breakout

[10:29:47] RJWOne: modifying is much better for track/daily and way cheaper. I have a modified 450whp Nissan Stagea, only $40k AU into it and it's a monster on track and easy daily
[10:30:19] RezaQ8: Might as well show them the spots
[10:30:20] speedracer38: @dudleyisdumb I'm assuming you had the previous generation DBS because the new one is a rock with depreciation
[10:30:21] DudleyIsDumb: @rjwone yeah I was going to get a Supra and tune it, down pipe it and get a body kit for it and call it a day

[10:30:30] mattimao1239: Maybe behind each van you send one of your guys that you trust in another car following to make sure they’re good during the initial move. If the cops stop your guy or the van runner than you’ll know

[10:30:47] DudleyIsDumb: @speedracer38 yeah it was a 2012 black carbon edition I got cheap from a family member
[10:30:52] CannibalPuppies: @DudleyIsDumb I think the Shelby is a better pick.

[10:31:36] DudleyIsDumb: @cannibalpuppies but with that, I wanted the manual one which is the gt350, but it’s a little low on power for my taste. Didn’t want to void the warranty with a whipped supercharger

[10:32:49] CannibalPuppies: @DudleyIsDumb Just get the 500 if you're worried about HP and if you're really worried about warranty stay away from tuning newer cars. All I gotta say about that. Plus newer GT500's easy to mod
[10:32:56] Tweker: still didnt even touch the part about the movie theater KEKW
