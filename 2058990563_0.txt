[5:29:10] TeemSmeek: @Dalmier, I did run it through a bottleneck calculator and it is saying 9th gen i9 is not good enough
[5:29:30] Daelaron86: It's definitely the CPU
[5:29:48] forever_eber: computers. I like computers crystTap

[5:30:50] Dalmier: Bottleneck calculators arent that accurate tbh a i9 9900 is pretty good, dont forget this game was launched when intel had 4th out
[5:31:32] Daelaron86: It's not stock GTA though, the requirements don't apply
[5:31:34] morkain: Swan is in on the heist? pogg
[5:31:37] TeemSmeek: @Dalmier it is a lower gen though i would expect a 3070 with an 11th gen at least
