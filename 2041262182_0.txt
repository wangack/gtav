[0:08:50] mynameismikeyd: Ruth’s character see’s Den saying in court about the rolled bills being sticky etc that got the guilty charge for it, as Den lying in court to a judge as there was no evidence for it and only a CI’s word. So Ruth wants Den gone because she feels he can’t be trust and broke the law
[0:08:51] porzingoats: I hope only back to cadets prayge

[0:15:10] chmbrs: DenzeL smh
[0:15:10] MoistMouthMags: @Deansocool how awful is the CVPI now that you had a chance to drive the interceptor
[0:15:11] devintalktech: @Deansocool, I think at most you accept 1 dap for not being fully mindful of officer safety, because there is no SOP and it's not conduct unbecoming
[0:15:13] ctsblindsniper: @ctsblindsniper I know She did... Its the RP side not the IRL shes talking like He had the opportunity to catch her.. when shes not even there
[0:15:14] BLazOR_Prime: @Raccoonuary lol fr
[0:15:14] RadiantOrbit: Please what happened
[0:15:17] eeem234: DAPzeL is crazy 😂
[0:15:18] v_SHIFT_v: @Raccoonuary so true
[0:15:20] OiAM_Paka: what time is that
[0:15:21] m4l1kkk: @condor2104 no, he would actually snitch on her LUL
[0:15:29] synzzo: ask the capt
[0:15:30] slatt5: crims giving u hell captain giving u hell getting told to fuck off LUL  somebody help this man
[0:15:30] devintalktech: You'd still be working on shift one
[0:15:31] BahaZero1: Daptain Ruth is farming credits
[0:15:31] joster124: no dont think so
[0:15:32] BLazOR_Prime: how does a DAP take longer to fall off than a warrant for an arrest of a criminal
[0:15:33] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: Turner has given 0 daps on his shift 🤩
[0:15:36] danielb2705: If Ruth gets her way no
[0:15:36] Matosere: bro jump ship off shift 1
[0:15:36] MexiBrent: the issues will still be brought up to Ruth
[0:15:37] marneraiders: I think so, but ask turner
[0:15:38] n8dogg03: 4-5 am?
[0:15:38] AbeFroman2: FeelsWeirdManW
[0:15:38] B0N0N: no
[0:15:38] zomgeo: probs need to be half the shift or over?
[0:15:38] Clivent: i mean you are but theres not enough cops surely
[0:15:39] ZaxKHD: Clueless
[0:15:40] captain_steve_420: why not start a couple hours after shift 2 starts?
[0:15:40] n8dogg03: EZ
[0:15:41] OiAM_Paka: We all became morning mfs so we need a heads up if we need to adjust lol
[0:15:41] devintalktech: so she'd still be your captain for the shift
[0:15:42] Adeelsheikhy: ask turner 😂
[0:15:44] joster124: Cornwood does that
[0:15:44] wellie2404: call a captain and ask
[0:15:44] ghostdogg69: Do cg hours
[0:15:47] ImOome: why dont you just play crim until shift 2, then go on duty
[0:15:47] OldOhana: it’s when ur shift starts isn’t that what they said ?
[0:15:48] BLazOR_Prime: Transfer to shift 2
[0:15:48] xypher85: idk
[0:15:51] xypher85: Shruge
[0:15:51] marneraiders: ask turner
[0:15:52] eaglezFly: they said whatever shift u start in
[0:15:53] synzzo: maybe a merge style shift idk
[0:15:54] SuuWasTaken: dont think so, cornwood starts before shift 2 and is considered shift 2 right?
[0:15:54] joeorbow: Ruth wants you out so bad its not funny
[0:15:57] sendu6666: findoutinrp
[0:16:00] devintalktech: Think of it like working overtime for a different captain ya know
[0:16:01] nizmo_ttn: i just want a lil deanq rp
[0:16:02] Freddan__Ars: that won’t stop Ruth
[0:16:03] nizmo_ttn: just a bit
[0:16:03] getanime: @xxxjimmypeenxxx so how he deal with problems???
[0:16:04] eaglezFly: its whatever shift you start in
[0:16:04] AlienatedFL: I think shift 3 makes sense
[0:16:05] synzzo: merge shift 3 and 1 but u answer to turner
[0:16:06] RYANizee: I say go talk to turner see what he says about shifts etc
[0:16:06] sonadapop: it won't matter if Ruth is the captain on duty at the time
[0:16:07] 406scott: yo
[0:16:10] AlienatedFL: wake up early go to bed early
[0:16:13] goingafk0: will you continue with denzel if he gets fired?
[0:16:14] themadnasty: for some reason twitch gives me all ads in spanish. honestly not mad about it
[0:16:15] AlienatedFL: live a normal ife
[0:16:17] sonadapop: they don't want to split up the PD into shifts like that
[0:16:19] m4l1kkk: Deep in NA?
[0:16:20] viralostrich: Den Zel crim arc
[0:16:22] JDMack10: I think we need some Dean Quincy so Den can have a break 🤣
[0:16:27] noklump: Cant run from her, gotta figure out to get on her good ise
[0:16:28] Paxipher: @madchopps SAME lmao
[0:16:28] hyotee: @xxxjimmypeenxxx @getanime he talks them through
[0:16:31] LittleTexas_SheriffZesty: Dean Mincy mornings Denzel pm pd
[0:16:34] BLazOR_Prime: @goingafk0 he would proabably go to BCSA when that opens up
[0:16:38] TheHoll0w: Maybe some Dean Quincy in the early times FeelsStrongMan
[0:16:39] Strupset: Don't forget to gas Ruth up like yesterday, "Nice nails cpt, are those new shoes? daaamn"
[0:16:39] megaxbrain: Stare
[0:16:40] kb420ps: This all depends on PRINCIPLE!!! If you leave the shift, she wins.
[0:16:42] SilveR_FL: youre still him
[0:16:43] eaglezFly: @noklump its far too late
[0:16:44] sonadapop: @noklump i don't think that'll ever happen lol
[0:16:45] bricksquad1234: Bro just say you're taking PTO until the Daps are over
[0:16:47] m4l1kkk: What shift is the start of NA to the end of it?
[0:16:49] SuuWasTaken: Dean Quincy before tsunami untill BCSO
[0:16:49] MakiWind: Who fired u before was that ruth two
[0:16:49] Happy_raptor1: whats happings??
[0:16:50] aadamw: get on the same shift as slacks whatever that is
[0:16:53] Wynter282: denzel is even more screwed now because ruth feels like the other captains arent respecting her decisions so shes going to do everything in her power to show she can do things she wants, and denzel is fully caught in that
[0:16:54] condor2104: More of a reason  now to get Little texas Sherrif's office up and running
[0:16:59] slatt5: I would just play crim until Storm then go on pd character after like esfand does
[0:17:05] viralostrich: Den is a broken man.
[0:17:10] MoohamedAlii: KKonaW we need the little Texas militia
[0:17:27] 1thecrazyryan1rp: Shift 1 ends when restarts hits
[0:17:29] m4l1kkk: Can't Den run SDSO? deansoSadge
[0:17:30] devintalktech: @Deansocool, as a character, I don't think she has it out for you, but you're on her radar as a "problem", as is cornwood.
[0:17:32] blackluigi___: Dump Ruth in the ocean
[0:17:36] Faylez: time for crim zel
[0:17:37] xl_scout_lx: Chat what did I miss? Did Den get DAPS?
[0:17:40] EddeLFC: Shiestyyyyy my goat cop
[0:17:45] aadamw: do crim till after storm
[0:17:46] kb420ps: @bricksquad1234 That is the BEST solution.  Anything else is an L waiting to happen.
[0:17:46] xypher85: at this point, i wouldnt blame denzel if he turns his badge in
[0:17:46] Eyedea67: Gm chat and Dean
[0:17:51] AbeFroman2: no daps yet
[0:17:52] noklump: Monthh old report lmao
[0:17:55] AbeFroman2: morning dean hope you have a good stream deansoHeart back to lurk
[0:17:58] m4l1kkk: DQ deansoPeepo
[0:17:58] marneraiders: 2023 report, damn
[0:18:00] sonadapop: @xl_scout_lx he's looking at 3 daps for the incident with De Rolo yesterday
[0:18:09] dohtENV: Chat, Did the issue with Aziz and Sanja get resolved yet?
[0:18:15] Happy_raptor1: @sonadapop WAAAAA
[0:18:15] AbeFroman2: peepoLurk
[0:18:16] sonadapop: @dohtENV nope
[0:18:16] wellie2404: this shits a month old
[0:18:17] hyotee: if u dont want daps then do traffic stops they are low risk policing
[0:18:18] AlienatedFL: @sonadapop which is truely wild
[0:18:19] Happy_raptor1: why 3
[0:18:22] getanime: @hyotee That how u should handle problem... I dislike this DAP system
[0:18:25] reactseu: LUL
[0:18:31] kb420ps: @dohtenv not really
[0:18:37] improvisablex: o7 last report
[0:18:37] Juvraj: spice it up
[0:18:40] n8dogg03: no @dohtENV meeting in 6 hrs
[0:18:44] sonadapop: @AlienatedFL agreed. it should be 1 dap.
[0:18:51] sirjarles: @Happy_raptor1 riding in an armored g6 truck is dangerous, 3 daps
[0:18:52] hyotee: @hyotee @getanime yeah i agree
[0:18:54] n8dogg03: 111
[0:18:58] AlienatedFL: @hyotee i swear he's done nothing wrong based on the book - they basically make the rules as they go along and Denzel is the example
[0:18:58] shadowstorm3654: hi
[0:19:00] jinxedrng: why does Ruth hate you so much?
[0:19:03] Paxipher: deansoRich
[0:19:07] imtooepic7676: Shout out turner.
[0:19:09] jimborat: Depending on how this situation pans out I would probably turn in to a fully dirty cop
[0:19:13] SuuWasTaken: back to redlining on 1st gear LuL
[0:19:17] m4l1kkk: Slacks x Den x Aziz
[0:19:20] condor2104: I get the need for DAPS, but w/o teaching or learning something, they are useless.
[0:19:23] Raccoonuary: if somebody said "UH" over coms as much as the fake radio voice did they would get yelled at a lot by now
[0:19:26] m4l1kkk: You need Slacks as your captain
[0:19:26] GalaxyDoesTwich: already a chase???????
[0:19:27] iridescent_nike: They hate to see you do well
[0:19:29] AbeFroman2: deansoHeart
[0:19:30] getanime: @jinxedrng mystery that no one knows
[0:19:31] AlienatedFL: easily super petty situation no way he should be dapped
[0:19:40] kb420ps: @jinxedrng that is a very good question.
[0:19:43] taytoeGG: I mean you do live with Slacks lol
[0:19:44] n8dogg03: Den zel is right on this one, which sucks Sadge
[0:19:46] porzingoats: @jimborat i think its againts the rule to RP as corrupt cop? I might be wrong
[0:19:48] MargaPlaits: yo
[0:19:54] Trixcross: it's gonna be fine COPIUM
[0:19:57] thricerice1: o7
[0:20:03] Paxipher: Rizz Turner up!!
[0:20:06] AbeFroman2: lets try to keep him cheered up chat
[0:20:08] Cosm1cChaos1: Captain in the killzone is crazy
[0:20:11] 1CaptainRedBeard1: The truth will come out. Denz will be fine.
[0:20:12] slatt5: @condor2104 60 days for rules that don’t exist/change within 24 hours LUL
[0:20:16] Sup3rU: good tuner there
[0:20:16] 1CaptainRedBeard1: COPIUM
[0:20:19] sonadapop: @AlienatedFL yeah that may be true but the captains do have a point with the officer safety. it should be common sense not to get into the back of a vehicle while on duty.
[0:20:19] 406scott: can you ride with turner
[0:20:24] Horizon_GFX: just seen the clips video why is ruth on your case so much lol
[0:20:25] Myagus: I hope people still get to differenciate between RP and real grudges. I would hate to see Ruth get actual hate over this.
[0:20:29] wiglaf__: didnt know turner actually patrolled
[0:20:29] m4l1kkk: Stay positive, you might get fired, you still have DQ to play on deansoHeart2
[0:20:29] thricerice1: Den was right ruth is out to get him
[0:20:30] luckyp1ngu: hellooo
[0:20:31] MargaPlaits: stop stressing out my guy
[0:20:32] izzywizzy95: izzywizzy95 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:20:34] RebornOffline: I hope we get to hear from Penny Lane
[0:20:40] MargaPlaits: if it happens it happens
[0:20:44] porzingoats: In Denz We Believe!
[0:20:47] improvisablex: I head LSPD is hiring
[0:20:50] AbeFroman2: they didnt even list penny lane or clayton as involved
[0:20:50] captain_steve_420: If the truth doesnt come out, then the admins should get involved bc lying about a player to get them removed from the pd is toxic and should be against the rules imo
[0:20:53] ExcelEntei_: Morning everybody
[0:20:55] GamingAudioBook: yo chat do i leave work early or work the full shift
[0:20:55] detergent86: this should have just stayed between the three it happened to. I do t get the need to snitch to management
[0:20:56] charlie25253: tbh turner had you’re back the rp between turner and Ruth is spicy
[0:20:56] rachsahota1: Content on Dean will be fun I'm sure :)
[0:20:56] Trixcross: nah it will be fine I don't think they wanna fire you
[0:20:57] Zunnun: Chat Deanooooo SOB deansoHeart2
[0:21:00] 1thecrazyryan1rp: Trooper shiesty would be funny
[0:21:02] 1CaptainRedBeard1: Time to push Cornwood opening the BCSO. You know you have a job there.
[0:21:03] bobbybeee: denzel just needs to keep his cool, breath and speak straight
[0:21:04] 1CaptainRedBeard1: Lol
[0:21:05] bricksquad1234: how would this situation get handled in the military?
[0:21:09] thricerice1: If you saw the meeting between ruthless and captain turner you basically fucked
[0:21:09] condor2104: I think Ruth is eyeing the Sheriff's office for herself, she wants to get the hell out of LSPD
[0:21:10] williamwildcat: @sonadapop and why wouldnt you just use that opportunity to teach someone that instead of saying "Fuck off"
[0:21:11] Lord_Legolas: just tell the truth and trust Aziz and Turner, you will be fine deansoHeart2 @Deansocool
[0:21:11] m4l1kkk: Den is the most loved cop by crims, but the most hated amongst PD 😂😂😂
[0:21:14] 1CaptainRedBeard1: I know. It's soon.
[0:21:15] AlienatedFL: @sonadapop i guess, the counter to that is he's doing an investigation with trustworthy contacts - not like they didn't think about it (but if they do give a dap for that 1 max)
[0:21:15] surelyURjokingMrFeynman: 1 DAP for being in the vehicle is fair, 3 DAPs for De Rolo saying fuck off, review De Rolo's rank, but Ruth won't go for that
[0:21:16] adrian_md46: new cop Den "Zel" "Not" Shiesty II KEKW
[0:21:16] dafroman: @margaplaits you wouldn't be stressing if u were in the edge of losing ur job? 😅
[0:21:21] amdj30: You making it like you at fault chill about it
[0:21:23] slatt5: basically she’s trying to manipulate the situation so that u not saying much to her is the only thing to go off of instead of what u told Turner
[0:21:24] sirjarles: its okay dean. Once Den is kicked off the pd, he can rent a shed in 4heads backyard. everything gonna be fine
[0:21:26] synzzo: Sheriff Turner CoolCat
[0:21:27] fatpig_456: Imagine Dean finds out ruth fired denz and goes demon mode
[0:21:30] Zunnun: You goon be alright @deansocool we got deanQ atleast
[0:21:30] Trystah: Don't worry, we will support you in your Senor Buns arc o7
[0:21:31] m4l1kkk: Den is loved by the crims, hated by his own colleagues 😭
[0:21:34] sonadapop: @williamwildcat no i completely agree with you. the DAP system is being abused here.
[0:21:42] detergent86: yeah I woke up to Ruth and turner meeting was quite icy
[0:21:43] williamwildcat: ye
[0:21:43] joster124: yesterday i saw a vid of Fanfan applying for cop its was funny af KEKW
[0:21:44] catfish_quackenbush: The back of the 6 truck, i can see 1 dap for. THe telling senior that you dont BELIEVE you need her permission to talk to CIs was 100% a perfet respectful response, your in the clear for that.
[0:21:45] OldOhana: 🍵
[0:21:46] thricerice1: Even if den is fine now him staying at shift one is a risk
[0:21:48] akonv3: u should start shooting people
[0:21:51] Clivent: you gonna bee goood
[0:21:52] Gaulty33: @Deansocool I want to apologize if i made any bad comment yesterday. Im newly cooked into this content and i already feel hooked. Not backing Aziz made my blood flow, consider that a big W for your RP. Im a grown ass man and never react like that normally. Sorry again
[0:21:52] RYANizee: speak to turner say you’re stressed and on edge about it all not just this situation but everyday
[0:21:53] captain_steve_420: Yeah Ruth is acting corrupt as hell
[0:21:55] Trixcross: if they wanna fire you that's crazy so I feel like they'll give you 2 daps at most @deansocool
[0:21:55] AbeFroman2: [+] positive vibes for you man deansoHeart
[0:21:55] goingafk0: would you file a case if you got falsy dapped for this
[0:21:59] raqsypoo: Sr. Buns has also some codes, code red for example <3
[0:22:00] 1CaptainRedBeard1: Ruth is incredibly quick to DAP. It's a shortcoming of her character. It's pretty nasty.
[0:22:00] Clivent: that was so wild for real
[0:22:02] condor2104: Ruth's RP is great though tbh
[0:22:03] m4l1kkk: Den gets more love from 4head than from Ruth LUL
[0:22:07] marneraiders: Is CI defined as Criminal Informant or Confidential Informant?
[0:22:12] Nightmare_19xx: Dean, i know you shouldnt have to, but can you just switch to shift 2 or 3 instead to avoid her alotgether?
[0:22:13] AnusReaktorMan: @deansocool cheever so good in rp tho
[0:22:14] thricerice1: Why not change shift then?
[0:22:19] jimborat: If justice is served Den and Aziz get 1 DAP each imo
[0:22:19] adrian_md46: deansoSadge deansoSadge
[0:22:21] poultry_motion: Buy 50 or so guns now whilst you can
[0:22:28] m4l1kkk: No room for growth 💔
[0:22:29] Clivent: like it should have been handled way differently not just start yelling at you
[0:22:29] sendu6666: good, prepare for the worst
[0:22:31] ghostdogg69: If Denzel gets fired he has to hunt her everyday
[0:22:33] JC9R_: it’s o7 brother
[0:22:33] BoobieMiless: only people that have daps are those who are most close to cornwood. denzel, aziz and andrews... pretty Susge . and all daps handed by ruth.
[0:22:34] Smypher: I think Ruth is after Den but Turner is after Ruth
[0:22:34] williamwildcat: sucks man. youre an awesome cop RPer and seems toxic to constantly tear you down
[0:22:34] mr_vibe01: you just gotta get her before she gets you
[0:22:37] n8dogg03: take notes. you forget this shit in the meetings
[0:22:39] 1CaptainRedBeard1: @poultry_motion Taking a page from Cornwood's book. KEKW
[0:22:39] RYANizee: should report to Turner not slacks, slacks is neutral but turner tells Ruth straight on everything
[0:22:40] zomgeo: Ruth is so quick to make judgement. Turner and slacks will take the time to see all sides and make a fair judgement
[0:22:41] MargaPlaits: yea it over my guy
[0:22:41] hyotee: @marneraiders confidential, not every CI is criminal
[0:22:44] ChantelleP_: How long do DAPs last?
[0:22:44] Clivent: OMEGALUL
[0:22:45] bobbybeee: it's more of the principle of the matter.. thats the problem im sure
[0:22:48] isomonk: at worse threres a review then slacks will rescue Den's ass
[0:22:50] themadnasty: idk whats going on, but I feel like they shouldnt fire a full time actually good cop, when you got people like parmesean and cornwood (no hate to them)
[0:22:50] Zunnun: Have you had a talk with turner yet or slacks @deansocool ?
[0:22:51] zekonja17: watched stream yesterday, did you get dapped?
[0:22:51] MrTaxReturn: get internal affairs involved
[0:22:51] wellie2404: brother says he fixed his reports while filling one in from December
[0:22:55] kb420ps: DAPzeL getting fired would make GREAT RP. Love it or hate. Big time drama.
[0:22:56] Cultivated: switch shifts not only for yourself but for us lol
[0:22:56] MakiWind: Snr buns
[0:22:58] porzingoats: As Slacks said PD need to focus on growth not punishment
[0:22:59] captain_steve_420: even if you get dapped, I dont think you're getting fired. Once you're off Ruth's shift it should be all good
[0:22:59] detergent86: esfand was going to bat for ya in turners chat earlier this morning. everyone but Ruth lmao
[0:23:00] IIIIIIIlllIIllIIII: fuck it bring back den shiesty
[0:23:02] AntonioMartins13: F THAT HOEEEE LMAO
[0:23:02] surelyURjokingMrFeynman: doubt Slacks or Turner would fire you at 10 DAPs
[0:23:05] mr_vibe01: you gotta get back brother lmaoo
[0:23:07] BLazOR_Prime: if ruth could, she would rather put cops in jail and let criminals go
[0:23:09] slatt5: at the end of the day I don’t think admins will let 1 captain get u fired because that looks bad imo but that’s just me
[0:23:13] n8dogg03: write down a few bullet points to have in the meeting
[0:23:14] AlienatedFL: can you start shift 3 late?
[0:23:14] AbeFroman2: can the vote for daps be 2-1 or is it set in stone already
[0:23:15] wellbigsmoke: @BLazOR_Prime frfr
[0:23:15] monkz89: the fact that sonya wants you to get 3 DAPS after she apologized to you is some BS
[0:23:17] sendu6666: or sue her, do it with Aziz
[0:23:19] sonadapop: @AlienatedFL it's reckless as hell. no cop IRL is gonna do that. you don't know where they're actually taking you. not every single action needs to be explicitly stated in SOPs. but yeah, 1 dap max for officer safety
[0:23:22] condor2104: I think Den should lay low, and just do the mere basics for now
[0:23:24] Faylez: @BoobieMiless cornwood is the only threat to her becoming sheriff so makes sense
[0:23:25] jimborat: @zunnun he did with Turner off stream
[0:23:26] AlienatedFL: Like start at 7 am or 630 am

[0:41:11] 1CaptainRedBeard1: You need to be calm when you present your side though. Talk slow, don't get ahead of yourself. Ask them for a warning, say you did the wrong thing and you understand it - make it clear it wont happen again. @Deansocool

[0:42:00] Kaisenjin: Ruth is being very childish don't listening to Turner, only wanting to do things her way
[0:42:08] blackops567: @Deansocool when you were talking to turner he told you to take a breathe because he could see you getting flustered, hes a great captain
[0:42:10] Sonicfear: @kb420ps Ruth stated the amount and Turner agreed.

[0:42:45] catfish_quackenbush: @Sonicfear they just had another meeting after Turners talk with Den
[0:42:52] AbeFroman2: ruth will prob get overruled but lets wait and see
[0:42:58] bobbybeee: @Sonicfear but turner then disagreed... and turned to 1 dap
[0:42:59] 1CaptainRedBeard1: @Sonicfear Negative. He agreed at first but once he investigated more he wasn't on board with 3.

[0:43:22] kb420ps: @catfish_quackenbush it's DEFINITELY not fair. The thing is, if she doesn't get 3 now, she'll continue to find ways to fire Denzel. It's just a matter of time.
[0:43:22] tyler__96: you ain’t gonna have a schedule if you get fired

[0:44:15] beberocker: @dubbini okay
[0:44:20] Kaisenjin: Turner is in favor of smaller daps for Denzel and Aziz because their mistake was minimal, now Derole is going to take a big dap or getting down

[0:45:06] Cheexur: Ruth gonna 07 sheisty as an example for recruits lol
[0:45:07] khlaah: @Deansocool I have a feeling Ruth is going to work this whole situation so that Slacks and Turner don't have a say in the matter by keeping it all below 3
[0:45:08] eaglezFly: northern most spot of norway is a great place to live @deansocool
[0:45:09] xypher85: Come to montreal
[0:45:11] DudeInARobe: I’m down near Gulf Shores. been here a year now for Army Corps. love it

[0:45:15] mynameismikeyd: rather an Ice age than a hurricane
[0:45:15] jimborat: @krish0604 I'd say all 3 have their own biases. Ruth's just happens to be against Den

[0:45:27] floresulisess: yea but just for like a week no biggie
[0:45:30] Kaisenjin: @Kaisenjin Because Derolo lied and tried to throw everything at them
[0:45:31] MoohamedAlii: its better than hurricane every year
[0:45:32] kb420ps: @catfish_quackenbush ABSOLUTELY! She's asserting her dominance. She wants to fire Denzel and make an example of him.
[0:45:36] Vendatus: I feel for RP reasons it be dumb if Den or Cornwood get fired you need "dumb/comic relief officers"
[0:45:36] Murtaza_00: move to Hawaii
[0:45:43] armedgolem01: ice age my balls they are just pussy's live in ny lol

[0:45:48] froogo0: Feels like Ruth don't want Denzel to do anything off the SOPs Sadge But this completely stops police work when the crims are getting creative.
[0:45:51] m4l1kkk: Den can't survive with Ruth around deansoSadge
[0:45:52] eaglezFly: @vendatus doesnt matter in 4.0

[0:51:06] RadiantOrbit: Is Ruth awake?
[0:51:09] KloudO2: o7 Last day as coppa
[0:51:11] RYANizee: does anyone know what time the meeting is UK time
[0:51:11] Zunnun: @xypher85 obsession at this point deansoP
[0:51:11] KO1N: If they fire bro lowkey Lawyering up with ramee and sueing for wrongful termination would be funny asf

[0:51:28] Faylez: elevator PepeLaugh
[0:51:31] AlienatedFL: They all have absolute power and voting is like a curtesy
[0:51:32] Sonicfear: She never said she wants Den fired.
[0:51:33] AbeFroman2: @AlienatedFL it doesnt?
[0:51:33] macneutron: @riiftzzz Den might go on indefinite suspension
[0:51:33] tellos0: ppl actually think that Ruth wants him fired ahah
[0:51:34] blaze2556: whats the your plan if you do end up getting suspended? @Deansocool you still going to game on GTA
[0:51:34] Larzbtw: do you think the captains take this way too serious at the end of the day? seems like theyre forgetting its just RP
[0:51:35] zomgeo: 3 daps and we take ruth hostage on hood robin
[0:51:36] kb420ps: Getting fired for SOPs that don't exist is the PRIMARY reason that proves there needs to be a Police Union.
[0:51:36] angus1794: but also funny
[0:51:37] RabzKC: @KO1N that would be s-tier RP
[0:51:38] mynameismikeyd: dean my logs, says why she wants you gone
[0:51:39] ArmyOfFutsak: cant you start an investigation against a crim organisation to make it hard for them to fire you
[0:51:40] Claxman2000: @whysocial 4PM Eastern
[0:51:42] Vendatus: It's not they want him fired it's just Ruth

[0:51:42] bobbybeee: is it becasue she loves you.. she wants a relationship, but the job says no lol
[0:51:43] thricerice1: Even if ruth get overruled she could still give him 2 dap and 1 more to get rid of him
[0:51:43] xypher85: Sadge no longer cop viewers after today

[0:52:08] BenthamBestBoy: @bobbybeee 😳
[0:52:08] AlienatedFL: @AbeFroman2 nope they can all do what they want but they try "not to step on each others toes" basically they all have power and votes are curtesy
[0:52:08] m4l1kkk: Den could be perfect, they'll find a reason LUL

[0:52:13] 1CaptainRedBeard1: @stellarnaut Sanya De Rolo, Aldo Jackson I think.
[0:52:16] Larzbtw: do you think the captains take this way too serious at the end of the day? seems like theyre forgetting its just RP
[0:52:17] eaglezFly: she has never once praised denzel but always punishes him
[0:52:18] ArmyOfFutsak: she cant say she wants him fires as it shows bias
[0:52:19] themadnasty: Den gets replaces by fucking Parmesan lmao
[0:52:20] DudeInARobe: you were acting in good faith. so don’t fret
[0:52:24] Splaxxyy: We need Cornwood to become sheriff

[0:52:29] jake_hewiitt: she wants him but cant because she is his boss - that why she wants to get rid of him BibleThump
[0:52:31] Myagus: Love ya dean. Hope the day is still gonna be great even with the shit going on
[0:52:36] VenomVeinZ: just stand on biasness
[0:52:36] moe1124: nothing but daps
[0:52:36] trevoniel: t’s not for SOP that you’re being punished for thou it’s for being in a civilian car and not notifying officers of your location
[0:52:39] Q_Neaux: maybe with so many new officers coming onto the force.. she wants to make you an example or something
[0:52:40] xypher85: @jake_hewiitt AYOO
[0:52:41] SrHuncho: what happened ???
[0:52:43] BenthamBestBoy: @madchopps LUL
[0:52:43] AbeFroman2: @AlienatedFL hmm that wasnt the way in the past, 3+ has to be unanimous they agreed on
[0:52:44] AlienatedFL: It's pretty whack

[0:53:02] wellie2404: @jake_hewiitt exactly. no fraternising with colleagues and all that
[0:53:10] Zunnun: Does derolo steeam chat?
[0:53:12] mynameismikeyd: Dean read my chat log,  I wrote the reason she wants you gone, she said it on her stream from her characters perspective
[0:53:12] Raccoonuary: they need to add 4856 to the PD with corrective action and all lol
[0:53:14] fie17: she's giving you training from the school of hard knocks

[0:53:22] moe1124: she has a channel
[0:53:24] AlienatedFL: @AbeFroman2 the caps were talking about it this morning, and it seems like they can give daps without the others agreeing
[0:53:24] Eraborea: stay on Bidness brotha
[0:53:25] m4l1kkk: He can't read that
[0:53:26] moe1124: but doesnt stream
[0:53:26] catfish_quackenbush: Yea Ruth is about daps, not about hey, lets talk about what you did wrong, and how to correct it. Turner and Slacks are more like while you will get DAPs, we want to explain why, and work with you on learning
[0:53:29] ll_Adam_ll: if you get enough DAPs to be fired, can you appeal?
[0:53:30] d_o_g_o_: @mynameismikeyd well he cant use it then can he
[0:53:31] Garethblock43: she hates you coz she saw your tags

[0:53:39] beberocker: Why ur all characters I mean all characters put under the bus deansoBozo deansoBozo
[0:53:40] dubbini: Maybe ruth is trying to be in tune with the culture and dap denzel but is mistaking it for disciplinary points
[0:53:40] xypher85: @Garethblock43 OMEGALUL
[0:53:46] macneutron: @mynameismikeyd Can u repeat the reason, didn't see it
[0:53:48] djack29: I’m new what happened?

[0:54:33] moe1124: @Zunnun same
[0:54:33] sonadapop: Duncan is Dwight Schrute. lol
[0:54:38] AndreSays: easy defense for you imo. You already have a pattern of her refusing to be open in communication with you by refusing ride alongs not to mention she stacks DAPs which should be a nono
[0:54:40] chmbrs: yup
[0:54:40] ThatGirlRiri: Good morning Dean and everyone thatgi16Love

[0:54:43] 1CaptainRedBeard1: Want to know the real long game here, Dean? Hang around Ruth long enough that she accidentally hits your character/incaps you. Perma Denz and have her charged with manslaughter. Kappa.

[0:54:56] MoohamedAlii: den cornwood and aziz starts LASO after they fired
[0:54:59] TheMagnificentBastard: Tekkit with Duncan iykyk
[0:54:59] Zunnun: @mikanteax depends on the cop after watching aziz and ruth conversation it seem like there where alot of favorites
[0:55:00] moe1124: @xypher85 yup
[0:55:00] n8dogg03: i forgot my locker combo cause i never went in it LUL
[0:55:14] Eraborea: I hope this Ruth& Denzel thing doesn't turn into an ERP situation

[0:55:26] itisacar: criminals: stealing guns from PD. Duncan: "yeah there's too many hit and run accidents in the streets gotta do some paperwork about that"
[0:55:32] sixteenbackup: when is storm?
[0:55:33] AUXY_1: I thhink the worst part is that azis says he is feeling unsafe and that is why he wears vest on patrol, and instead adressing that issues it's just possible DAPs
[0:55:35] xypher85: @m4l1kkk it is Sadge
[0:55:36] chmbrs: sniper
[0:55:36] Iam_VKA: Bro, I'm scared for you and I don't know why. RP is too gooooddddd.
[0:55:59] Eraborea: @Eraborea Plot twitst
[0:56:03] dubbini: Next time ruth gives you a dap you should clarify if she wants to dap you up maybe? she might be confusing the two
[0:56:04] 1CaptainRedBeard1: @AUXY_1 Actually true. He has a legit reason and concern and it's being disregarded.

[0:56:50] AUXY_1: @1CaptainRedBeard1 Yes very much agree

[0:57:31] froogo0: Aziz is definitely not getting past 7 total DAPs, so the worst he'll get to is a 24hr suspension. This aint good, but it's light compared wot what Denzel is risking.
[0:57:33] danielb2705: Make a one lifer that just kills cops
[0:57:35] cwasrightt: Chat who has the most daps after cornwood and den? andrews with 2 right?
[0:57:35] Q_Neaux: if you appeal any DAPs would you have a lawyer (ramee) defend you
[0:57:37] AUXY_1: @adrian000 Is that actually planned?
[0:57:40] m4l1kkk: Karen 1 lifer deansoSpin
[0:57:41] AlienatedFL: All cause you're supposed to like what? call before talking to CI's
[0:57:43] n8dogg03: never been brought up EVER
[0:57:43] AlienatedFL: crazy
[0:57:46] Eraborea: You should do a 24 hr DAPathon @Deansocool
[0:57:48] el_reyito: Cornwood has the most
[0:57:49] mynameismikeyd: if you have a discipline meeting can’t you have an advocate there with you? maybe take cornwood along
[0:57:52] zac4e: Do that hryLaf
[0:57:54] AndreSays: SOP and pattern against you specifically
[0:57:56] PeterPanTheKing: Clueless 1 DAP
[0:57:57] B__M__C: yes you can :)
[0:58:01] SmokeyPumkin: yes u can lol
[0:58:01] siilkyt: just got here what happened chat?
[0:58:01] kb420ps: That's not going to make a difference.
[0:58:02] xmusica_: PepeLaugh
[0:58:03] adrian000: If everyone is online @AUXY_1
[0:58:03] el_reyito: Clueless
[0:58:06] AlienatedFL: they finna say "officer safety is common sense"
[0:58:06] catfish_quackenbush: @el_reyito cornwood and sen are tied at 7
[0:58:08] RobotsAndMaltLiquor: AGAIN by the way Turner the only captain trying to do right by Denzel
[0:58:10] 1CaptainRedBeard1: @el_reyito Denz has the most iirc. Well, they are tied.
[0:58:12] AbeFroman2: its still common sense but the fact ur getting punished is the bad thing
[0:58:15] n8dogg03: de rollo has it out for you.
[0:58:21] UIt1mat3: and the pattern that its always u
[0:58:21] Zunnun: She do not care about you o7 Deano
[0:58:21] WASSUPDUG: whens a decision made about the daps?
[0:58:22] jaacccckk: Did you get dapped for the incident??
[0:58:24] Wynter282: shes pushing for other daps with the lies told about what you said too
[0:58:25] ll_Adam_ll: if you met up with Doug in some random car, fair enough.. but not an armoured G6 wagon, with Aziz, armed and the two G6 employees are the highest ranking available LUL
[0:58:26] Eraborea: Cornwood murder kitty incident PepeLaugh
[0:58:28] B__M__C: "I can't be DAPed for that"  Clueless
[0:58:31] AUXY_1: If either you or Aziz gets more than 1 DAP, De Rolo should be demoted. Or it's crazy unfair
[0:58:34] jake_barn: Sue for wrongful termination and get her fired LUL
[0:58:35] mayoooo__: what happened????
[0:58:37] sendu6666: Ruth argues " there is no SOP saying that officers should not fly a jet plane on duty"
[0:58:37] laaazylemon: Ruth is the one who is always by the SOP's now she tries to push something thats not in there is very odd :D
[0:58:37] adrian000: @AUXY_1 All captains have said they will be online, den will be, aziz and derolo idk
[0:58:37] AlienatedFL: Im just saying that's their angle
[0:58:38] 1CaptainRedBeard1: Busted
[0:58:47] jimborat: You will get dapped for getting in the truck fs. Everything else is just bs
[0:58:51] xypher85: TheVoices
[0:58:54] AbeFroman2: my sound lowered by 10x randomly
[0:58:57] cwasrightt: @Eraborea Clueless that is the worst cornwood incident
[0:58:58] el_reyito: Where cornwood at
[0:58:58] xypher85: TheVoices 󠀀
[0:59:01] eaglezFly: you need to push dap stacking @deansocool
[0:59:01] SoggyM0uth: WAYTOODANK
[0:59:02] jaacccckk: Chat did Ruth DAP him ?
[0:59:03] AUXY_1: @adrian000 Damn fair, I hope it happens. Gonna be juicy RP LUL
[0:59:03] moe1124: civs with no ticket
[0:59:05] sirjarles: could drive you into the ocean
[0:59:06] moe1124: to their name
[0:59:07] skkyee12: we cant hear ingame
[0:59:07] Zunnun: @auxy_1 demotion and suspension is only right fr
[0:59:09] sonadapop: thank you for lowering volume
[0:59:10] mayoooo__: can someone briefly explain what happened?
[0:59:10] zac4e: A vehicle that is also a target for crims
[0:59:10] zainahmad19: is Aziz wearing a vest after his partner got shot not also common sense? that’s double standards lol
[0:59:11] beberocker: Put case on ruth
[0:59:15] goingafk0: I think in terms of kidnapping
[0:59:18] angus1794: if the CI turns on you?
[0:59:21] bobbybeee: it's the principle of being in a CI vehicle... not just this situation.. but as a whole
[0:59:21] Myagus: Also no tickets or PC?
[0:59:22] el_reyito: u muted game king
[0:59:28] AlienatedFL: They gonna say "but you can get kidnapped" and you're gonna say "but i know these guys"
[0:59:33] catfish_quackenbush: @jaacccckk not yet, but she is pushing for 3 daps for the group 6 truck part alone
[0:59:34] ll_Adam_ll: Turner just heard your horn issue hahaha
[0:59:38] franciep3113: they could turn on you and kidnap you
[0:59:40] mavericks312: nah Ruth just got a vendetta bro
[0:59:40] n8dogg03: make notes so you stay on point and not distracted
[0:59:41] jonski1220: they could kidnap you
[0:59:44] rchouse: Shiesty isn't the cop that Los Santos needs, but he is the cop that LS deserves
[0:59:46] AlienatedFL: I just know their arguements cause they already said them
[0:59:49] Inprobus: foheadCry
[0:59:50] slatt5: yeah different people feel safe in different situations there’s too much nuance to it to not have SOPs on it
[0:59:52] AUXY_1: @Zunnun Ong I can maybe understand if they want to be lenient because it's a shitshow, but then they have to be lenient to den and aziz too
[0:59:56] marneraiders: They have the security clearance for the Vault even !
[0:59:58] 1CaptainRedBeard1: Just leave a murder kitty in Ruth's office. EZ
[1:00:07] froogo0: Another important point is: the situation start with Cpt. Ruth's order to find more info. If officers misinterprets, this is not intentional. Definitely not 3 DAP worthy.
[1:00:08] L_a_z_o_r: true
[1:00:10] dillon_619: If things did get bad you have all the time to call for backup
[1:00:11] sendemup: foreal, kit archer got into a car with PEANUT of all people and nothing happened KEK
[1:00:12] WASSUPDUG: true
[1:00:14] n8dogg03: qrite that down HmmNotes
[1:00:15] sonadapop: hmm that is a good point.
[1:00:18] franciep3113: what about with ramee he’s a lawyer
[1:00:18] Clivent: you should use that as an example
[1:00:19] red_eyed_jed1: these are good arguments
[1:00:19] bxgchasing: sup gang
[1:00:19] Q_Neaux: like you said... theres no SOP
[1:00:20] Clivent: yeahhh
[1:00:21] mayoooo__: can someone briefly explain what happened?
[1:00:21] xypher85: ReallyMad disrespecting a police officer
[1:00:22] RadiantOrbit: What actually happened??
[1:00:27] mouad_thegoat: That's good answer
[1:00:32] DrWings87: don't self-snitch!
[1:00:32] samjack007007: wont you get dapped for that instead?
[1:00:33] danielb2705: Because that situation didn't turn into anything negative
[1:00:34] aaron_bermy: deansonotes
[1:00:40] 1CaptainRedBeard1: @sendemup She didn't do that on duty, right?
[1:00:40] Zunnun: @auxy_1 i can't lie feel like its gonna be a o7 for Deano aziz suspended and they will be lenient with derolo sadly
[1:00:41] sendu6666: good, don't arguw tith us, do it to Ruth
[1:00:43] AlienatedFL: i'm not busting your balls dean, I been listening to their talks w/ yall
[1:00:44] xypher85: can someone write a TLDR and make it a command?
[1:00:44] m4l1kkk: Speak with your chest, you have nothing to lose anymore deansoSadge
[1:00:45] 1CaptainRedBeard1: If I remember correctly.
[1:00:46] OldOhana: going to get a dap for that incident now 2
[1:00:49] blackops567: denzel fighting for his fucking life out here
[1:00:55] n8dogg03: they are going to try to steer the converation away when they are wrong.  stay on point
[1:00:56] catfish_quackenbush: @mayoooo__ in the words of Cornwood, it was a Dang Dum Shitshow
[1:01:02] AbeFroman2: jason was upset with you in the past though... remember the trespassing thing, kinda shakey
[1:01:06] kb420ps: There going to argue that you left your vehicle, and therefore could not answer calls. Also, when you got in to the back of the G6 van without letting anyone else know.  That's what they are going to use to DAP you.
[1:01:09] somebetasimp: is this the drama from yesterday? senior telling him to fuck off?
[1:01:10] chaosproductions: if I were you, I’d start by owning up that the situation could have been handled better.  but officers have to take on some risk to do their jobs. the officer should be trusted to assess the risk. @deansocool
[1:01:11] slatt5: cornwood caught someone who fell off a bridge we should dap him for officer safety too LUL
[1:01:12] Raccoonuary: appeal to common sense is a logical fallacy anyways, or basically a crap argument.
[1:01:14] m33k_b: so what happened really
[1:01:18] marneraiders: The G6 Have no records, you have been working with them for a long time, they even have the vault clearance, armored truck….
[1:01:22] 1CaptainRedBeard1: KEKW
[1:01:23] m33k_b: why another dap possibly
[1:01:32] chrisatkinson11: beware I’d Douglas gunnaguther
[1:01:41] Zunnun: Anyone willing to wrtie a TLDR from yesterday i will make the command deansoHeart2
[1:01:42] AUXY_1: @Zunnun I don't think so, I guess it depends on this possible meeting. I don't want to say too much meta shit, but Turner is definitely not completely with Ruth, not sure about Slacks
[1:01:44] BeerRun204: What is Sonja position?
[1:01:53] somebetasimp: jasons a civillian with no record same with everyone in the car
[1:01:57] 1CaptainRedBeard1: @BeerRun204 Senior Officer
[1:02:07] MonkeyFace101: The most frustrating this is that Ruth also wants to DAP Aziz because he stated that “Ruth favors” Certain officers. He asked to speak plainly, and now wants to DAP him.
[1:02:10] meso4724: did he get a dap chat?
[1:02:10] kb420ps: @beerrun204 Senior Officer.  2 Stripes
[1:02:14] jaacccckk: Someone pls tell me- did Ruth DAP him for the fuck off incident?
[1:02:14] khawnnor: so whats the deal with this server?  is there a specific way to request access?
[1:02:16] BeerRun204: She told you to fuck off?
[1:02:16] VioraX: you need to hire dougles to perma Ruth
[1:02:20] Wynter282: you should write your whole defense down all what you have just been saying so you dont get overwhelmed and hdmi into saying the wrong thing in the meeting
[1:02:20] RYANizee: gets to meeting later: “ yes mam, yes sir, I was wrong I won’t do it again” 🤣
[1:02:22] chaosproductions: if I were you, I’d start by owning up that the situation could have been handled better.  but officers have to take on some risk to do their jobs. the officer should be trusted to assess the risk. @deansocool
[1:02:23] 1CaptainRedBeard1: @meso4724 He PROBABLY will.
[1:02:32] AUXY_1: @jaacccckk Still pending
[1:02:34] GilbertGilberto: 3 times KEKW
[1:02:34] Zunnun: @auxy_1 yeah i do know that turner is against ruth on this situation but feel like they still will find a way sadly
[1:02:35] AbeFroman2: why didnt jason save you though
[1:02:39] xypher85: is there a clip for the fuck off?
[1:02:41] RobotsAndMaltLiquor: she told you to fuck ALL THE WAY off
[1:02:42] mutantzombie01: chat I need a run down on what has happened today chat I need a run down on what has happened today chat I need a run down on what has happened today
[1:02:42] laaazylemon: DeRollo thinks you said "dont need your permission in terms of a "mission" like that. you should focus on the "...talking to a CI" part after that
[1:02:51] II__LuKaS__II: I would try to also stress the "Common sense" because thats dependent on situation place background and all other shit so it becomes uncommon @Deansocool
[1:02:52] marneraiders: Write your defense in Bullet points aswell as your whole story
[1:02:57] m4l1kkk: Jason lied 💔

[1:03:09] kb420ps: I enjoyed her saying, "FUCK OFF"   That was good RP!!!!
[1:03:10] goingafk0: are you going to get the civs as witnesses @Deansocool
[1:03:17] marneraiders: Write that down
[1:03:18] catfish_quackenbush: @muller2526 it makes good RP as the villian kind of. I get it, its frustrating, but as far as RP as a whole, it does add a story, but yea, sometimes it seems a bit too much is going unchecked
[1:03:20] xypher85: write that down HmmNotes

[1:03:22] Kaisenjin: @Zunnun Turner is totally not in favor of Ruth, he just agreed that they should not have get in the van without talk with others officers
[1:03:24] zac4e: @MonkeyFace101 I found that weird aswell, he specificlly asked if he could talk plainly
[1:03:25] AbeFroman2: you know clayton and penny lane werent even mentioned in the report?
[1:03:25] floresulisess: get a lawyer in game and sue them especially if they’re targeting you to get fired ?
[1:03:26] xypher85: write that down HmmNotes 󠀀
[1:03:27] slugfests__: the only thing you said was “you’re not going to talk to me like that”
[1:03:28] marneraiders: Write your whole story in Bukletpoint
[1:03:33] its_R4HUL: i think aziz asked them that how they feel about what they saw
[1:03:34] BeerRun204: Hostile work environment,  that was. Professional on her part?
[1:03:40] BLazOR_Prime: if ruth got kidnapped and denzel saves her, ruth will find a a way to dap denzel
[1:03:41] ll_Adam_ll: I've never been so invested in something.. this RP work is top
[1:03:46] mutantzombie01: chat I need a run down on what has happened today chat I need a run down on what has happened today chat I need a run down on what has happened today
[1:03:49] m4l1kkk: Bro is being unfairly targeted deansoSadge
[1:03:49] 1CaptainRedBeard1: You should definitely try to write up something for a bit here, @Deansocool and get your facts completely straight. Including your thoughts on the events that transpired. Will make your side of the meeting more compelling
[1:03:54] Panos_97: @Deansocool Keep writing things down so you don't forget them, you're getting better at SOP/paperwork despite this incident
[1:03:54] Zunnun: @mutantzombie01  nothing today that we know of only yesterday stuff
[1:04:06] Skullii: do you know how many points you get?
[1:04:08] akonv3: @mutantzombie01 check xiceman vod with denzel early
[1:04:08] MonkeyFace101: @zac4e Yeah. you can’t allow someone to speak plainly and openly and then get mad when they do.
[1:04:13] catfish_quackenbush: @jaacccckk nothing was done yet. its in reports, and captians are discussing. Ruth is ready to DAP the crap out of him, but Turner says he wants to have them all in a room to talk and get it all straight, cause things are not lining up for Turner
[1:04:14] imansf2: More quiet today
[1:04:16] mutantzombie01: thx @zunnun
[1:04:19] akonv3: @mutantzombie01 and the follow up with ruth
[1:04:19] laaazylemon: "getting permission" vs "getting permission to talk to CI" is the miscom that they dont understand. Focus on that I think would be better
[1:04:20] Wyburn: she totally wouldnt go off like that to anyone else for that... that was targeted
[1:04:25] n8dogg03: she still lies a lot
[1:04:26] iconqor: do we know when this meeting is happening between Den and the captains?
[1:04:27] marneraiders: Write It Down, Your story, your defense argument
[1:04:35] jamiew4085: jamiew4085 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:04:35] AUXY_1: @Zunnun Maybe. Praying for denzel farPray Either way this is great RP LUL
[1:04:40] BDG_Toa676: Fresh W deansoShake
[1:04:42] blackops567: @Zunnun denzel talked to captain turner this morning, dont want to meta too hard though
[1:04:44] 1CaptainRedBeard1: Her apology imo means nothing with her position. Senior Officers are supposed to be held to an even higher standard than you guys.
[1:04:44] AbeFroman2: ruth is recommending 3 daps for sonya though i think
[1:04:46] BDG_Toa676: Welcome to deansoBDG deansoBDG2
[1:04:48] RYANizee: write that down !
[1:04:53] Kaztiell: I just dont understand how it can be considered a risk to meet with g6, then g6 should need more protection if its so risky
[1:04:54] hosseinfel: shit I stoped watching yesterday, is it still about sonya :D
[1:04:58] Sully_Rin: did you speak to Turner already?
[1:04:58] Zunnun: @mutantzombie01 dean did have a conversation with turner but dean wasn't streaming it xicman was tho haven't seen the conversation myself
[1:04:59] marneraiders: Write it down
[1:05:01] Sully_Rin: I just joined
[1:05:02] xP4NC4K3_M1Xx: @mutantzombie01 den had a chat with turner to clear some things up that had been misconstrued.
[1:05:03] mouad_thegoat: Why you just told her that ??
[1:05:03] Wynter282: you should write your whole defense down all what you have just been saying so you dont get overwhelmed and hdmi into saying the wrong thing in the meeting
[1:05:06] thomas1874x: how Sonya is a senior is wild
[1:05:09] catfish_quackenbush: the CI part, your in the clear, dont sweat thar, there is no SOP, there will be after this is all over, but currently no SOP and your good
[1:05:10] Banchu: Ruth is going for triple DAP for both I think
[1:05:14] FrankieFunkk: essaying
[1:05:16] tkmoney: write THISS
[1:05:17] its_R4HUL: NOTED
[1:05:18] kb420ps: @blazor_prime funny you mentioned that.  Didn't Captain Ruth call off the pursuit of a kidnapping victim who later was found dead [PERMA]?
[1:05:18] MisterBrojangles: deansoCozy @bobbybeee thanks for the sub!
[1:05:22] AlienatedFL: There is a world where DeSolo's not losing her mind and we are just patrolling
[1:05:23] xypher85: HmmNotes
[1:05:23] Lord_Legolas: @AbeFroman2 she's not recommending, she has to, for the rest to get 3 as well
[1:05:28] m33k_b: fuck Ruth
[1:05:29] Juvraj: @AbeFroman2 its basically how many Denzel will get so will Sanya
[1:05:31] AbeFroman2: shes giving her senior 3 daps yea
[1:05:32] USER_ELEVEN11: SUP DOGG
[1:05:34] m33k_b: she’s horrible
[1:05:39] viralostrich: how we holding up in here?
[1:05:40] jamiew4085: Glad I could finally subscribe Dean... your part of my day to day lifestyle now brother!!! Big up cuh!!
[1:05:41] aaronfoster18: Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1
[1:05:41] mayoooo__: Ruth needs to get fired already
[1:05:42] AbeFroman2: she should def be demoted imo lol
[1:05:44] el_reyito: King
[1:05:44] m4l1kkk: She apologized, she backtracked. It was a safe operation
[1:05:44] kb420ps: #JUSTICE4MANBAT
[1:05:51] Zunnun: @blackops567 oooh i know he did meant that chat don't really know about that
[1:05:53] mouad_thegoat: Chat remember its just rp
[1:05:55] catfish_quackenbush: @Banchu she was going for 3 daps just for the riding in the back of the truck. and more for the rest
[1:05:56] Turki_18: what meeting ?
[1:06:01] laaazylemon: "getting permission" vs "getting permission to talk to a CI" is the miscom they (captains) dont understand. Focus on that I think would be better
[1:06:02] ExcelEntei_: And don't forget to compliment her again 😂
[1:06:02] ll_Adam_ll: are DAPs/decisions given on the basis of probability or is it beyond reasonable doubt?
[1:06:08] marneraiders: write your “Resoectfully I don’t think…” Down, you will change it seven rimes
[1:06:10] xypher85: @Zunnun
[1:06:16] 1CaptainRedBeard1: Truthfully what Rolo did was worse than Denz. Denz should get a warning for the truck, yes, but it's not in SOPs and CI isn't fleshed out yet. Rolo swearing at an officer and berating them in public in front of civilians? Unacceptable completely.
[1:06:21] BeerRun204: Without a law it can't be violated. Therefore without a directive in SOP there should be no violation
[1:06:32] Kaztiell: I just dont understand how it can be considered a risk to meet with g6, then g6 should need more protection if its so risky @Deansocool
[1:06:34] AbeFroman2: shes only hung up on your CI car bit
[1:06:36] Jethrq: Damn yesterday was crazy since chat hella lively today lmfao deansoGVO
[1:06:36] JoshGB_: They view that as saying you don't need her permission to jump into a cop car
[1:06:38] macneutron: To Those Who Missed It https://www.twitch.tv/deansocool/clip/AmazingBlazingPieYouWHY-QZqolKXcewV19oWt
[1:06:38] j0Ity: some people have made daps sound like not such a big deal, like it wouldnt lead to firing
[1:06:39] Zunnun: @xypher85 yes bby
[1:06:44] JoshGB_: g6 truck*
[1:06:44] AlienatedFL: That's wild cause Dean has 7 and rest have none @Kaisenjin
[1:06:47] Wyburn: @catfish_quackenbush yea thats wild... maybe 1 dap ok but 3 xD
[1:06:54] thomas1874x: you should get dapped for something with no actual guidelines
[1:06:54] AbeFroman2: no i agree
[1:06:56] thomas1874x: irs wild

[1:07:07] thomas1874x: shouldn’t
[1:07:08] slugfests__: so did tell her “ you’re not going to talk to me like that” just in case they bring that up
[1:07:15] AUXY_1: @j0Ity It technically can. 10 DAPs is suspension pending review from high command
[1:07:15] evianlfc: when is the meeting? (uk time)
[1:07:17] somebetasimp: bomb the city
[1:07:21] marneraiders: is there anything about: Officer safety ?
[1:07:21] themadnasty: they go by the book so literally, no way they can dap you for shit that isnt explicitly stated in SOPs
[1:07:21] AbeFroman2: shes more mad at aziz than you LUL
[1:07:23] n8dogg03: 5 hours
[1:07:27] m4l1kkk: This is emotional deansoSadge
[1:07:29] RYANizee: well according to Ruth you’re not allowed out of your car 😂
[1:07:30] el_reyito: Denny boutta get aziz permad
[1:07:32] Banchu: hypothetically if Den gets fired you could make completely different Cop character right?
[1:07:33] froogo0: True, it's not right to punish someone first, then write the rule afterwards.
[1:07:38] dubbini: you should talk to the captains like they are chat i think thatll help
[1:07:38] Wynter282: @mouad_thegoat hes literally getting anxiety irl over it its dean's job as a streamer its affecting too at the end of the day
[1:07:42] chmbrs: @deansocool you should have a notepad up on your second monitor for you to jot down the points you wanna talk about later on. deansoHeart2
[1:07:44] mr_donnelly: Bro as a crim viewer den is like the best cop so far of 4.0 this crazy
[1:07:46] beberocker: Who snitched tho chat?
[1:07:49] catfish_quackenbush: @muller2526 exactly. i know if they are too lose, then its bad, but too strict, and cop rp is boring. Like can you imagine cornwood if he had to be 100% by the Ruth book?
[1:07:50] jamiew4085: deansoSpin deansoSpin
[1:07:51] Kaisenjin: There is no SoP, you made a small mistake, but Ruth wants blood and defends Derolo
[1:07:51] AlienatedFL: Dude was laying low too
[1:07:53] thricerice1: They could do
[1:07:54] el_reyito: @Banchu hed have to go through training and shit all over again
[1:07:55] macneutron: @evianlfc 9PM
[1:07:55] AUXY_1: @AbeFroman2 Because Aziz told it to her face LUL
[1:07:55] zac4e: That is how laws are made tho
[1:07:58] Mystikalrush: They should issue warnings for the exact infraction for a potential DAP, once you do it again for the exact item, then you get the point.
[1:07:59] thomas1874x: yeah
[1:07:59] xypher85: WRITE THAT DOWN
[1:08:01] BahaZero1: she called Ruth 30 sec after "f""" off" thats just childisch behaviour
[1:08:02] SrHuncho: thats a lawsuit if you get fired
[1:08:03] captain_steve_420: If you watch Aldo's stream, it's very clear that Ruth, Aldo, and DeRolo are out to get Denzel
[1:08:03] B__M__C: yeah, Ruth definitely can't and won't do that Clueless
[1:08:05] themadnasty: add it to the script
[1:08:08] n8dogg03: not riding in other cars has never been brought up before
[1:08:10] 1thecrazyryan1rp: @Deansocool it was there before
[1:08:11] hosseinfel: or change the rules
[1:08:15] xypher85: WRITE WHAT YOU JUST SAID
[1:08:17] slatt5: @evianlfc 5 hours from now :)
[1:08:19] marneraiders: But is there anything regarding “Officer safety” stated in there
[1:08:20] m4l1kkk: Ruth tried defending Derulo when Derulo wouldn't defend it deansoP
[1:08:20] kb420ps: Captain Ruth should be fired for calling off the pursuit of a kidnapping which later led to the kidnapping victim's death [PERMA]. So far,  Captain Ruth has NOT been disciplined or DAPed for that incredibly terrible decision.
[1:08:20] mavericks312: den aziz and cornwood are carrying the pd right now
[1:08:22] thricerice1: You work so much den your so eager that you make mistake for taking things so fast
[1:08:22] KloudO2: yea get her ass dean
[1:08:24] AbeFroman2: yeah she hated that aziz accused her deansoLul
[1:08:27] goingafk0: They say the punishment fits the crime, but no crime was commited
[1:08:27] el_reyito: write that ass down
[1:08:29] mouad_thegoat: Write that
[1:08:32] thricerice1: You need to slow down
[1:08:36] KloudO2: invite her on a cop donut date and tell her all that
[1:08:40] manfredalfredgernot: Would it be a court case if you appeal the DAPs or is it not possible to appeal DAPS?
[1:08:42] chaosproductions: your argument needs to be that you assessed the situation, and the risk was minimal for the benefit gained
[1:08:42] II__LuKaS__II: and 3 daps is wild its too much of a serious count when only ten is nbeeded for expulsion
[1:08:44] BeerRun204: SOP is supposed to be a guide that covers all directives for your department, if there is no directive there should be no violation.
[1:08:46] pathasahat: @kb420ps I think Ruth is secretly a crim op
[1:08:49] jeepers_creepers94: Chat GPT zrkGunfinger
[1:08:54] 1CaptainRedBeard1: @kb420ps She should be dapped realistically for the stuff she's done and all of her issued DAPS should be reviewed.
[1:08:55] getanime: @BahaZero1 sadly ruth is promoting that kinda behavior
[1:08:55] RYANizee: I hope Aziz is in that meeting you just know he will go off 😅
[1:08:56] aaronfoster18: missed my bits
[1:08:57] RobotsAndMaltLiquor: @manfredalfredgernot not possible to appeal today
[1:08:58] captain_steve_420: I honestly think the admins should get involved in this
[1:09:01] Turki_18: anything about leaving ur cvpi?
[1:09:01] laaazylemon: deRollo understood it as "getting permission" as for a "mission" like that. that is the problem. I promise you it all comes down to that. or she intentionally misunderstood it... :D
[1:09:12] slatt5: @kloudo2 donut date Pog
[1:09:14] 1CaptainRedBeard1: @captain_steve_420 Naw.
[1:09:16] Banchu: admins def should not be involved, its RP
[1:09:20] m4l1kkk: Why do they give DAPs instead of talking about it, and guiding and teaching the person to do better?
[1:09:26] macneutron: @captain_steve_420 no need for that
[1:09:27] jacksmithcje: sop or not its probably silly behaviour which is a dap but derulo and aziz said stuff more unprofessional so themselves can get 2 or 3 thats my honest opinion
[1:09:30] 1CaptainRedBeard1: It's all RP, they're figuring it out in RP.
[1:09:33] mutantzombie01: @deansocool remember when you tried to  fire someone and they just made a new dap
[1:09:34] Kaisenjin: @laaazylemon She later lied about it, there is no defense for what she did
[1:09:34] talgach: mhm
[1:09:35] captain_steve_420: @laaazylemon Nah bro. Go watch Aldo's stream. She's manipulative and definitely has it out for Den
[1:09:36] chmbrs: also getting dapped for something that is “common sense” is a bit crazy too.
[1:09:38] blackops567: @m4l1kkk they do, one captain doesn't o7
[1:09:39] ll_Adam_ll: chat, what time's the meeting?
[1:09:41] el_reyito: i be i be i be i be

[1:09:45] mouad_thegoat: Turner knows that
[1:09:47] BahaZero1: @getanime yeah, totaly umprofessional
[1:09:50] manfredalfredgernot: @RobotsAndMaltLiquor So he basically has to be fired to appeal?
[1:09:51] 1CaptainRedBeard1: If Denz presents his case clearly he'll come out clean. Ruth and Rolo might get fucked.
[1:09:53] AbeFroman2: 3pm est i think
[1:09:55] BobFromAccounts: Did De Rolo get a DAP?

[1:10:40] ll_Adam_ll: @slatt5 appreciated
[1:10:40] BeerRun204: I would ask the question why it was automatically 3 DAPs?? Then mention that Ruth knew u needed 3 DAPs to get to 10
[1:10:40] Raccoonuary: they will say it should be common sense but that doesn't really offer anything other than saying "i feel like it is wrong, therefore it is wrong" they gotta link it to a specific articulable reg
[1:10:40] el_reyito: do you got other characters @Deansocool
[1:10:44] captain_steve_420: @Frog69 they answer to admins

[1:10:54] Vendatus: Bruh at this point Ruth don't want to see or hear from Den till the meeting
[1:10:58] 1CaptainRedBeard1: @Frog69 The other two captains can issue daps as they see fit. Turner is already starting to see the light when it comes to Ruth. It's COMPLETELY possible right now.
[1:10:58] sendu6666: did you legit could not sleep?

[1:11:16] kb420ps: Reading those SOPs aren't going to make a difference at all.  It's just wasted energy.
[1:11:19] Zunnun: !addcommand !TLDR Denzel/Aziz were reprimanded by Snr Derolo in front of civilians for getting into a G6 truck without communicating.

[2:01:34] BDG_parth28: Weekly seems perfect
[2:01:38] m4l1kkk: A month is too long, bad idea
[2:01:45] Trixcross: @deansocool also keep track of improvements and readdress things if needed
[2:01:46] xGotNoClout: Ruth's monthly review - Got 7 Daps. For getting 7 Daps you get 3 more and are fired. Goodbye
[2:01:47] bobdang07hd: let Ruth give you a monthly review, would be perfect

[2:08:58] SkyeReaper: I think if you were just a little more reserved and relaxed, took your time, and didn't rush; most of these issues would be gone. You're doing great man, just relax and take time to breathe.
[2:08:59] xypher85: we wouldnt do that Kappa KEKW
[2:08:59] kb420ps: It looks like you are looking for positive reinforcement on the eve of you receiving disciplinary punishments.  That's why I said,  good idea,  bad timing.
[2:08:59] m4l1kkk: A shorter feedback cycle means you can improve quicker, so less DAPs

[3:19:53] xDeadxRabbitx: they still ain’t told you what was happening my dude?
[3:19:53] f0rbin: can he see de rolo's statement? i'm assuming no
[3:19:53] SirSuccMaster: Playing Den over Dean because its less drama Kapp
[3:19:54] lemmytunngainus: 2 daps 4 watt OkayuDance
[3:19:56] themadnasty: from talking to CI’s, to being a CI
[3:19:56] Amenorino: @m4l1kkk 1 is 1 too many
[3:19:56] xo1k: dude this shit is more stressful than a full time job wtf
[3:19:56] JJPowell73: is it just Cpt Ruth running the meeting?
[3:19:57] nationas: if it was below 3 you would have them already
[3:19:57] rayhxxn: I understand the 1 DAP for riding in a civs vehicle but I don't get the other 2
[3:19:57] nzofab: he got 2 daps?
[3:20:00] flamingacegibbo: she’s just got it out for you man sad to see
[3:20:00] AlienatedFL: 1 cause u got in the van 1 cause you talked back to derolo and its BRAZY imma do terrorism ig
[3:20:02] patpaton: But is this really RP if they are just bullshitting there way to DAPs?
[3:20:05] Strupset: @npr3333 dean is going to sit at PD for 2 months handing out donuts
[3:20:07] modooc56: For not following non existing SOP'S OMEGALUL
[3:20:10] DrWings87: if ruth gets her way. you and Aziz get at least 1 DAP each and Sonia gets nothing. so she can circumvent the other Captains needing to authorize the DAPs
[3:20:11] Abdullah_8499: @zunnun bro how many hours until the meeting, have it leave now but I want to see what time I can be back at
[3:20:12] iwannanuhh: I know Ruth is just a character and all but i really wish she wasnt part of the pd. its so frustrating hahaa
[3:20:16] rchouse: so was it a fake ass apology in the meeting yesterday? like if she's really sorry she would've withdrew what she said to Ruth right?
[3:20:17] LilJBoii: i've been on and off watching, are the potential daps for going with the ci's without permission or 'unprofessional behavior' type thing with de rolo?
[3:20:25] MAZIN_M_SAYEED: @rayhxxn Not even 1 dap, there are no guidelines
[3:20:25] teakake0akamyth: time to buy a bunch of PD guns to sell
[3:20:27] khlaah: I only see 1 for Den, from Turner that it'd be officer safety, but I see Turner being even on not giving him daps at all, but Turner wants De Rolo's rank and 3 daps for her
[3:20:27] m4l1kkk: No DAPs needed, just guidance and some accountability
[3:20:30] chivvyy: rayhxxn they arent just 1 each, some things get 3 daps, 5 daps, etc
[3:20:31] xsilas43: @EGGZOLENTZ, was a couple days ago now i forget when sry but xiceman has vods of it all

[3:20:53] Juvraj: LUL
[3:20:55] ezchz13: if they give you the daps anyways what can you do about it?
[3:20:55] nationas: deansoBozo
[3:20:56] jas3370: to be honest its common sense to not get in the back of a civilians car no matter how much you trust them
[3:20:56] Athasin: I don't think you're escaping this without at least 1 DAP for telling Sonja that she doesn't have permission to tell you how you meet up with your CI.
[3:20:56] murdof1: I want to feel stupid
[3:20:57] 895k: bro just got screamed at lol
[3:20:58] Zunnun: deansoOop
[3:20:58] iwannanuhh: Your fuck up was talking back to Ruth. The unwritten rule is no challenging the goddess
[3:20:59] autorocket: speedrun sheriffs office up north
[3:21:00] ezchz13: is there an appeal process

[3:21:10] AlienatedFL: this is a situation where all the captains on den's side but ruth and it's wiild
[3:21:10] EGGZOLENTZ: @xsilas43 ahhh i seen the one where she said his reports are shit and shes told him but never corrected it
[3:21:14] autorocket: cant dap you under sheriff cornwood
[3:21:15] xsilas43: showing up in shift 1 was the mistake KEKW
[3:21:15] khlaah: there really isn't any fuck up though, because no SOP's i think Ruth is throwing shit to the wall to see what sticks
[3:21:18] lemmytunngainus: 3 daps for trying to do actual work at Karen PD YEP
[3:21:18] Abdullah_8499: @zunnun do you know when will the meeting take place
[3:21:21] bwegkamp: bad moods, too easily dapped
[3:21:24] bobbybeee: would you go for a lawsuit if you get dapped?
[3:21:24] rayhxxn: Ty Chat. Still learning pd rp
[3:21:25] fishmeatx: NEXt
[3:21:30] roofrack1g: CUH thinks ruth wont DAP him for something not in sop o7 o7 o7 o7
[3:21:31] yungnams: @lemmytunngainus this
[3:21:32] bleu_starrr: Yes @rchouse .. It was a fake apology to get on record to make it seem as if she was making amends.
[3:21:34] Faildude: tell that in the meeting
[3:21:34] m4l1kkk: Den is innocent deansoSadge
[3:21:38] Strupset: cooking
[3:21:38] 9trashpanda9: daps were supposed to be corrective points to fix shit, it quickly turned into a way to get people fired. Needs to be changed all together
[3:21:39] Athasin: @Abdullah_8499 4 pm est unless it's changed
[3:21:42] fishmeatx: Lawsuit if fired?
[3:21:46] toddthestarfox: let’s bring us the vibes deansoHeart2 deansoHeart2 deansoHeart2 deansoHeart2 deansoHeart2

[3:21:48] Raccoonuary: common sense is not a good argument unless you point out where it applies in the reg. otherwise you are just going off feelies
[3:21:48] Pee_aRe: dont listen to chat they are dumb
[3:21:49] AlienatedFL: chat doing cross examination prep KEKW
[3:21:49] Clivent: o7

[3:22:00] Abdullah_8499: @athasin what’s that in gmt do you know
[3:22:00] TheHoll0w: Does that truck even considered fully civilian?
[3:22:00] JC9R_: den zel gotta be on this smoke during conversations
[3:22:00] flamingacegibbo: this is an RP server where’s the content in the PD ?lol you’re better off on crim/civ bro honestly
[3:22:01] Clivent: CAUGHT
[3:22:01] wilks91: if den thinks cap Ruth is the issue could he transfer to another shift?
[3:22:02] DonNiko99: Free Den Zel! deansoPeepo
[3:22:02] maleman205: When they call for a meeting you should have ramee there or a lawyer
[3:22:03] jak3jake: a real life cop would never get in another person vehicle though to be fair
[3:22:04] Luminarypanic: why are g6 workers considered civilians?
[3:22:04] brad_lfc12: what time is the meeting?
[3:22:06] lakis_myk: you should give captain Ruth a joint! she needs a puff for sure Kappa
[3:22:06] Busto1k: tbh you needa stand on business bro you kiss they ass too much i dont think they trust denzel
[3:22:08] dazza_m_____: the guy just wanted a little attention
[3:22:09] colinboddy529: deansoHeart2 deansoHeart2 deansoHeart2 deansoHeart2
[3:22:11] FabTheDuckOut: Den Zel and Aziz were speaking with a CI, that requires safety but also discretion. It was your decision, not derolo's.
[3:22:17] TheSvess: I think Ruth will probably try to hit you with Disorderly conduct 'cause of Sonya's statement alone
[3:22:18] bleu_starrr: @deansocool  you got this homie!
[3:22:18] toddthestarfox: chill vibes
[3:22:20] danielb2705: YOU WOKE UP

[3:22:22] xsilas43: you left the cop car
[3:22:23] aceof_eights: This is why we need Conan Clarkson a straight shooter
[3:22:28] Shankaze: jesus Christ, just watched Ruth's PoV when receiving the call from Sonia. Sonia can't handle the responsibility of Senior, SHE can not flip off like she did and then run to mommy Ruth
[3:22:31] BVNISH: the possession court case?
[3:22:32] BDG_parth28: I mean if this bs is stressful , is it even worth playing cop ?
[3:22:33] roofrack1g: will you have this energy vs ruth too
[3:22:37] khlaah: @Deansocool I only see 1 IF THAT. NO WAY you should see 3, NO WAY.  Turner is seeing the lies I think.
[3:22:38] AlienatedFL: these are exactly the things ruth finna say tho
[3:22:39] brad_lfc12: what time is the meeting with Ruth?
[3:22:39] SoggyM0uth: KEKW
[3:22:39] xsilas43: KEKW
[3:22:42] bobbybeee: LEAVE it all till meeting...
[3:22:42] FabTheDuckOut: Ruth only has a problem with that because you "questioned authority". Body cam footage would resolve this btw
[3:22:46] Fossabot: If your enjoying the stream smash the DAMN follow button! I mean shit its just a click away... Might see your name on screen ;)
[3:22:46] mouad_thegoat: Can you read the report. ?
[3:22:46] lemmytunngainus: it's on top of Den's head brother, use a mirror
[3:22:48] Athasin: @Abdullah_8499 Where is GMT? 4pm EST is 9 pm in England
[3:22:50] StevenB79: But was you in danger?
[3:22:50] tokke2025: unconduct of an officer, it’s in the SOPs
[3:22:53] getanime: they were civillian with no record too
[3:22:53] lemmytunngainus: worth 6 daps at least
[3:22:54] LilJBoii: @Shankaze ruth just promoted her loyalists
[3:22:54] Shankaze: I don't remember, BUT did u jump out of the back of the truck gun in hand?
[3:22:55] dianite_403: did any other officer who wasnt on scene with you know you met with the CI?
[3:22:55] badrfly: save this energy for ruth
[3:22:55] nationas: denzel needs to psych himself up bro
[3:22:56] Salah__Saj: also 20 mins before storm, NOTHING CAN HAPPEN
[3:22:56] jdoug4444: The bottom line is the captains are going to do what they want whether you're right or not
[3:22:57] yungnams: "officer safety" ITS A GAME
[3:23:04] EGGZOLENTZ: @pee_are we are thou LUL... we always say o7 joking or not LUL
[3:23:06] themadnasty: “you left the cop car”… so never go into snr buns or out of sight of your car
[3:23:07] xsilas43: problem is ruth will always take her snrs word over yours
[3:23:08] garnacho1720: your just a shocking police officer
[3:23:09] Murrig: @LilJBoii yep
[3:23:10] Janman88: maybe its time to challange ruth's behavior when u sue or anything, as nasty as it is - same level LUL
[3:23:13] m4l1kkk: Unconduct what
[3:23:13] AlienatedFL: Ruth also mad you talking back to Derolo (who didn't know anythign)
[3:23:14] random_viewer_55: Aziz and Denzel must SHOW Slacks and Turner that DeRollo lied on the report, about them disrespecting her and yelling at her.
[3:23:15] Abdullah_8499: @athasin appreciate that
[3:23:19] dazza_m_____: whats unconduct lmao
[3:23:21] m4l1kkk: Den didn't say F off 😭😭😭
[3:23:24] random_viewer_55: because the 3 DAPs are for that
[3:23:24] Strupset: she did say that you shouldn't have touched that civ car, I think the biggest problem she has is with that
[3:23:24] sonadapop: conduct unbecoming*
[3:23:25] Athasin: @Abdullah_8499 No problem!
[3:23:25] JxhnJxe: You had backup so idk why someone brought up officer safety
[3:23:28] npr3333: letting your car behind
[3:23:30] getanime: @Athasin In how many hours???
[3:23:31] EGGZOLENTZ: Ive seen cops in civs cars LUL
[3:23:33] yungnams: den zel needs to overthrow ruth
[3:23:35] moe1124: RIPBOZO
[3:23:36] nationas: sniper
[3:23:37] moe1124: time
[3:23:37] npr3333: that's what ruth will push
[3:23:37] Murrig: you didn't
[3:23:37] TheHoll0w: sniper
[3:23:38] badrfly: that word doesnt even exist
[3:23:42] JJPowell73: I dont see how DAPS can be handed out so quickly without any attempt to teach or help before someone reaches the point of getting a DAP. Seems a lot of the DAPS could have been dealt with differently
[3:23:42] ramsin50: you were unsafe that's why
[3:23:44] Busto1k: stand on business bro fuck a captain and all that you kiss ass too much the worst they can do is fire you who gives af
[3:23:44] Athasin: @getanime Less than 3
[3:23:44] Juvraj: SNIPED
[3:23:44] moe1124: what was it
[3:23:44] m4l1kkk: Den didn't say F off to his colleague mid convo 😂
[3:23:44] DeadReply: its misconduct, the clown who said that
[3:23:45] Raccoonuary: I do have a feeling it's gonna be at least 1 Dap den and aziz, they will find a way to bend it to a reg and 1-3 daps to sanya
[3:23:46] roofrack1g: you might be right but truth is you just gonna crumble vs ruth
[3:23:46] Kevindorv: sniper get his ass
[3:23:48] khlaah: yeah Ruth is really trying to protect De Rolo, it's very obvious that Ruth is 100% BIASED AS FUCK
[3:23:48] BDG_parth28: deansoSmoke deansoBozo deansoSmoke deansoBozo deansoBozo
[3:23:49] chmbrs: they arent even criminal informants KEKW
[3:23:51] fishmeatx: maybe you come of as rude to some people
[3:23:51] lemmytunngainus: unbelievable unoncus unconduct
[3:23:54] themadnasty: lvndmaCannon take the shot
[3:23:55] toddthestarfox: deansoSmoke
[3:23:56] whysocial: I think she felt like you were being aggressive because you were assertive in saying that you dont need her permission (but then she didnt hear the CI part) - HOWEVER, being assertive is not DAP worthy and nor is her response to you, that is her issue not yours
[3:23:58] bleu_starrr: De Rolo's statement is WILLLLLDDD
[3:23:59] amdj30: some people on chart are baiting don't give them attention
[3:23:59] Claxman2000: that’s what Ruth is going for
[3:24:00] Liiban____: speak like this to the cpts get ur point across
[3:24:00] getanime: @Athasin oh ok thats
[3:24:01] xo1k: u should dap her den
[3:24:01] bwegkamp: i saw on the vid it was also cause of "disrespect" but i dont think you were
[3:24:03] danrweb: Deano there's only one deano
[3:24:04] ramsin50: that's what the captains are giving the daps for dean
[3:24:04] f0rbin: i think the conduct unbecoming comes from the alleged yelling at de rolo, which we know didn't happen
[3:24:07] froogo0: IF anyone gets "Disorderly conduct". Sanja should get this DAP for reprimanding a fellow officer in public.
[3:24:07] darkj4ck: @tokke2025 this guy FeelsOkayMan
[3:24:08] iwannanuhh: You failed to read Ruth's mind. That will be 5 daps
[3:24:08] iiBonzo11: deans out on smoke lmaooo

[3:24:18] Mr_Ro: denzel and aziz also were police support for vault run too
[3:24:21] random_viewer_55: BRO Aziz is getting 4 DAPs and he didn't even say anything
[3:24:23] TheSvess: the meeting on 40 minutes right?
[3:24:24] StevenB79: I'll wait for the meeting
[3:24:25] jaacccckk: @iwannanuhh LUL
[3:24:26] EGGZOLENTZ: @jjpowell73 i think thats why he said denzel is an example
[3:24:30] MAZIN_M_SAYEED: Plus, those guys are trusted CIs
[3:24:31] moe1124: @TheSvess YUP
[3:24:32] SirSuccMaster: uncoonduct isn't even a word omE2
[3:24:36] 895k: really would like to know what sanja has to say about whats happening
[3:24:36] pehpeyguhh: didnt the chick herself say she stepped out of line? why is ruth taking it farther?
[3:24:37] xypher85: Getting chat logged is the worst thing that can happen to you, so dont be weird chat
[3:24:39] random_viewer_55: because DeRollo told that Aziz screamed and disrespected her
[3:24:42] bobbybeee: stop talking thinking about it.. will just piss people off.. leave it for capts.. and whatever happens go from there.. a plan/whatever... ez
[3:24:43] misskierah_x: Hey Deaaaaaan
[3:24:43] Zunnun: @tokke2025 @deansocool
[3:24:48] AverageLew: CHAT have i issed the meeting ?
[3:24:51] ramsin50: @random_viewer_55 he was very rude with ruth that's why
[3:24:53] toddthestarfox: the running the ape like some man haters. who else is above 5 daps besides cornwood and den
[3:24:56] Johnjoy121: Been enjoy the RP bro much love PotFriend
[3:24:56] jak3jake: the fact that Derollo apologized says it all, she was clearly in the wrong and a person with greater authority should receive greater punishment
[3:24:57] khlaah: I dunno, I think De Rolo and Ruth lost control of this narrative they are spinning on Den
[3:25:00] JJPowell73: Dont think Cpt Ruth should be the lead on this either
[3:25:02] toddthestarfox: pd
[3:25:04] Busto1k: they just power tripping fr fuck them move on id rather see dean quincy out in the field on hood cuh
[3:25:07] yeslewd: @AverageLew its in 3 hours I believe
[3:25:09] jaacccckk: If anything happens just bring up del rolo apology saying even she knew she was in the wrong
[3:25:09] Athasin: @random_viewer_55 Right! It's crazy she's gonna try to DAP for saying things after being given permission to talk freely.
[3:25:10] random_viewer_55: ramsin50 he was not rude at all.. he was very cordial;
[3:25:12] moe1124: @Zunnun STOOD ON BIDNEESSSS
[3:25:13] 895k: honestly
[3:25:15] brad_lfc12: @zunnun what time is the meeting with Ruth?
[3:25:16] MAZIN_M_SAYEED: Her apoligising shows she was in the wrong
[3:25:22] AverageLew: @yeslewd with ruth  ?
[3:25:22] MAZIN_M_SAYEED: *apologising
[3:25:23] moe1124: dean check @tokke2025
[3:25:24] mouad_thegoat: Can we see the Captain's statements. ??
[3:25:25] moe1124: logs
[3:25:30] badrfly: in reality denzel with his skinny neck makes him seem easy to dunk on
[3:25:30] ramsin50: she apologized for saying fuck off not that she was actually wrong
[3:25:33] Chipset3: Whats happened?
[3:25:34] bleu_starrr: @deansocool . Agree. But it was a fake apology. Her statement says different. Lol. Wildin
[3:25:34] StevenB79: I don't getting dapped for everything you do wrong that doesn't happen does it or no one would ever have a job
[3:25:35] M00zzy: should have never happened its not even good RP imho
[3:25:35] Nadeflow: Tf is that kind of decision
[3:25:36] fishmeatx: she deserves some type of repercussion in my opinion
[3:25:37] Strupset: if you get DAP for whatever happened with Sonya that is bullshit, with the civ car... I mean they can fight with you on that so you better be prepared
[3:25:39] random_viewer_55: ramsin50 if you can't even talk to your superior frankly then that means that superior is a problem.
[3:25:41] TheHoll0w: @moe1124 sniper
[3:25:42] Salah__Saj: they made a big of deal over nothing
[3:25:48] Murrig: you don't have to argue that she was wrong, they know that. you gotta argue that you weren't wrong
[3:25:49] yeslewd: @AverageLew all 3 captains and azis I think
[3:25:49] Raccoonuary: issue being that ruth conflates disagreement with disrespect
[3:25:51] jazmaniandevi: This is how it work in most real life scenarios this is also how good people go crazy and the smart get wikid
[3:25:51] Nadeflow: Every is held accountable
[3:25:53] 895k: an she said because i got 'caught'
[3:25:54] npr3333: the one getting 3 daps for sure and probably demotion is DeRolo
[3:25:55] 999krm: did she get dapped too?
[3:25:55] jordanjanman: what does dap mean
[3:25:56] Slim_Shady_Mcgrady: social experiment of women in positions of power not going well (joke calm down)
[3:25:56] EGGZOLENTZ: Its really quiet right now @deansocool
[3:25:58] Nadeflow: LAWERY UP DENZELL
[3:25:58] bobbybeee: lets do some police work :D focus on some other shit
[3:26:00] roofrack1g: ask ruth to show you how the daps are justified because im sure she will
[3:26:01] bwegkamp: why she aint getting dapped cause of the fuck off statements in front of civs
[3:26:02] nationas: its gonna be sadge
[3:26:07] toddthestarfox: @moe1124 damn get him
[3:26:08] khlaah: Slacks is gonna take Turner's side I think
[3:26:08] FabTheDuckOut: assuming no DAPs and water under the bridge, how would this change the dynamic going forward with Den and authority?
[3:26:09] SirSuccMaster: aziz needs to be there
[3:26:09] oliviahankcock: !viewage
[3:26:09] MAZIN_M_SAYEED: Prayge Denzel doesn't fold

[3:26:17] fishmeatx: FART OR SHIT?
[3:26:18] bleu_starrr: Call Ramee to represent you.. hahahahah
[3:26:23] moe1124: @tokke2025 dean
[3:26:24] Clivent: thats you
[3:26:26] Panos_97: You should not be the one to use her apology against her, it's kind of a dick move
[3:26:28] Zunnun: @deansocool can i ban the guy that said unconduct ? deansoP
[3:26:28] flamingacegibbo: whenever I watch Cop RP it looks stressful man like where the content ? lol
[3:26:31] lemmytunngainus: @bwegkamp cpt's fav Sure
[3:26:31] izahkiel: The whole situation is scuffed, honestly lmao. How did she know yall had guns out or not, was that a wild assumption or? She can't press you for something she had NO knowledge of. Right?
[3:26:32] chillmace: Captains currently can't face consequences?
[3:26:32] roofrack1g: CRUM-ZEL
[3:26:34] Athasin: @jaacccckk It's rigged. Ruth is gonna say exactly what she told Aziz, that what DeRolo did was out of line but not DAP worthy.
[3:26:37] ramsin50: @random_viewer_55 no he was very aggressive and told her if she doesn't dap her 3 points immediately she is biased
[3:26:40] m7jxz: what is a dap?
[3:26:41] whysocial: she basically got offended at you being assertive - this part shouldn't be your problem
[3:26:45] misskierah_x: @lilfishmeat 🤣😂
[3:26:45] brad_lfc12: @moe1124 what times the meeting with Ruth? don’t want to miss it
[3:26:49] EGGZOLENTZ: Lawyer up for dap points Kappa deansoSmoke deansoSmoke deansoBozo deansoBozo deansoF
[3:26:50] Murrig: file a civil suit against her for defamation or some shit
[3:26:53] Panos_97: @m7jxz Disciplinary Action Point
[3:26:57] AlvinMamba: I just hope everything resolves peacefully <3
[3:26:58] StevenB79: Dap don't fit must acquit
[3:26:59] Nadeflow: Civil suit pack finna hit
[3:27:00] JJPowell73: it will be crazy if the senior does not get a DAP
[3:27:02] misskierah_x: Nobody tells my dean to fuck off
[3:27:04] Raccoonuary: @brad_lfc12 4pm EST should be
[3:27:04] Zunnun: @brad_lfc12 4pm est
[3:27:05] m7jxz: @panos_97 tyy
[3:27:06] ramsin50: @Athasin she never said it wasn't dap worthy
[3:27:07] joster124: if you get fire ramee will bring you back to the pd KEKW
[3:27:07] moe1124: @brad_lfc12 after 40 mins
[3:27:08] SirSuccMaster: can you get re-hired after getting fired?
[3:27:08] spyrouly: i'm sure Its gonna be ok, no stress
[3:27:10] toddthestarfox: he seems quiet now y’all bringing him heat lmao
[3:27:11] Athasin: @ramsin50 That was after she gave him permission to talk freely.
[3:27:12] froogo0: Hmm Is it possible to sue the PD for unfair treatment of an employee?
[3:27:13] moe1124: after meeting
[3:27:19] MasNLFC: If you get fired will you ring ramee to sue for wrongful termination?
[3:27:24] brad_lfc12: thank you guys
[3:27:31] seemoor: Go and help your mate
[3:27:33] Liaum1: get rame to represent you KEKW
[3:27:33] Raccoonuary: if the daps don't fit... you must acquit
[3:27:33] dazza_m_____: no daps are getting handed out, i have faith
[3:27:34] StevenB79: think if you had a union
[3:27:35] Compulsive21: should be like f1, they expire within 1 calendar year/month
[3:27:36] khlaah: De Rolo is certainly getting 3, for sure. Turner wants her rank too
[3:27:36] MakiWind: Ask for a second chance and want to change to diffrent shift
[3:27:39] jak3jake: I wish the department spent this much effort in punishing criminals instead of officers. Especially for minor things like this
[3:27:42] lakis_myk: is there a possibility to fire you?
[3:27:43] toddthestarfox: @moe1124 almost got him lol
[3:27:46] avoidschickens: maybe try to find evidence of ruth treating you harsher than others
[3:27:46] Busto1k: denzel is bullied all his life NOTED
[3:27:46] random_viewer_55: @ramsin50 I don't know what aggressive means to you. He wasn't aggressive at all. He was expressing his grivances after 15minutes of Ruth covering for a Senior that disrespected him
[3:27:48] RunicCrustacean: i think excessive issuing of daps is also a problem. for 10 being mostly likely fired i think issuing three or 4 daps at a time is excessive.
[3:27:49] Juvraj: PROB ALL OF YOU GETTING 1 DAP
[3:27:50] Athasin: @ramsin50 She did to Aziz while Denzel was looking in through the security cameras.
[3:27:50] BDG_parth28: @deansocool  genuine question , if there is so much unnecessary bs stress , is it even worth playing cop atleast for now ?
[3:27:50] roofrack1g: its only hours from now and ill see a shirtless denzel washing dishes at snr buns with jp o7
[3:27:51] misskierah_x: There's noway he will get fired right???
[3:27:52] ramsin50: @Athasin talking freely has boundaries
[3:28:00] Shankaze: @khlaah he does?! Pog
[3:28:04] bobbybeee: im switching chat off.. i cba.
[3:28:05] m4l1kkk: Aggressive to who
[3:28:05] moe1124: FirstTimeSniper
[3:28:07] undy97: what’s happened Denzel better not be getting fired
[3:28:10] m4l1kkk: Den was gentle as hell
[3:28:12] dan1shb: It’s crazy how the same fuckery is happening in 4.0 as 3.0 - den getting bullied again Sadge
[3:28:13] moe1124: to who exaclty
[3:28:13] misskierah_x: Deans never aggressive
[3:28:13] Adeelsheikhy: think they meant aziz
[3:28:15] JxhnJxe: Defamation is a shout, your CI is thinking less of you now, is that not de faming you ?
[3:28:15] xxlonegunmanxx: @froogo0 he could possibly sue for workplace discrimination
[3:28:16] m4l1kkk: Den was too soft if anything
[3:28:18] themadnasty: lvndmaCannon lvndmaBan
[3:28:18] xypher85: @BDG_parth28 same question man
[3:28:19] MAZIN_M_SAYEED: sniper
[3:28:25] Nadeflow: Denzell needs to sneak into slacks room from time to time to get special treatment deansoP
[3:28:26] khlaah: @Shankaze I apologize I meta'd a little bit
[3:28:29] m4l1kkk: We make fun of Den being too soft, he's never aggressive LUL
[3:28:30] B0N0N: sup
[3:28:32] moe1124: @BDG_parth28 true af
[3:28:34] chmbrs: they meant aziz
[3:28:40] Busto1k: denzel is hella soft how can bro be aggressive
[3:28:41] Strupset: @Deansocool also she said something about leaving your car which means that you won't be able to respond to a call if needed
[3:28:48] moe1124: dean if u stressing this much cop really aint worth it
[3:28:54] roofrack1g: shirtless denzel snr buns era
[3:28:56] AlienatedFL: Well he shot that one guy
[3:28:56] whysocial: I said that she mistook your assertion for aggression, which is on her
[3:28:57] jaxorts: Anyone have a clip of what occurred?
[3:28:58] jak3jake: 1 DAP for Shiesty and Derollo should be demoted
[3:29:02] AlienatedFL: and he wanted to shoot a couple other guys
[3:29:03] Shankaze: @Deansocool think someone was saying Aziz was aggressive while talking to Ruth when demanding that De Rolo gets insta DAPed or else BIAS
[3:29:03] Clivent: https://clips.twitch.tv/GleamingDepressedCucumberM4xHeh-zSFHY1ojTEwmqZR3 󠀀
[3:29:04] ramsin50: @Athasin she wants to give her 3 daps so that's confusing
[3:29:07] xxlonegunmanxx: Harassment also fits really well for a civil case
[3:29:09] nationas: denzel too innocent for pd politics
[3:29:10] misskierah_x: How comes youre not on cam today Dean
[3:29:11] flamingacegibbo: look even over the radio no one sounds like they’re having fun lol
[3:29:13] Athasin: @ramsin50 Yeah, like don't curse me out or start yelling at me. But stating that you think your boss is biased because she's not treating everyone equally...
[3:29:13] thomas123456789012345677: yo what’s good @deansocool
[3:29:15] Panos_97: Denzel only gets aggressive when bullets fly
[3:29:21] toddthestarfox: Dean Quincy gonna come out the woodworks
[3:29:22] bobbybeee: cant you sort this bs out OOC?
[3:29:23] Murrig: did jayson give a statement saying the only raised voice he heard was hers, not yours? and that when he asked you what it was about, you refused to elaborate?
[3:29:23] avoidschickens: if Ruth wasn't your shift caption, would you have had as many DAPs?
[3:29:27] novariie: deansoLove2 deansoLove2 deansoLove2 deansoLove2 deansoLove2 deansoLove2 deansoLove2 deansoLove2 deansoLove2
[3:29:27] JJPowell73: Cop is a really good role but how the DAPs being handled seems stressful
[3:29:27] npr3333: anyone else in the scene other than her mentioned that you were aggressive in any way?
[3:29:29] VenomVeinZ: can you give daps to durulo for lieing @Deansocool
[3:29:35] Clivent: noraexComfy noraexComfy
[3:29:40] adrian_md46: !lurk
[3:29:40] Fossabot: Lurk mode enabled, back in a moment. Meditate NODDERS peepoLeave
[3:29:42] StevenB79: daps are a vote so it doesn't matter who your captain is
[3:29:46] Frog69: rp is rp but if someone is in a position of power and using that advantage to lie to take someones job, thats just lame im sorry
[3:29:52] chmbrs: is the whole vest SOP an actual thing IRL? seems so ridiculous??? feels like it should be officers discretion for when they can and can not wear it
[3:29:52] misskierah_x: Where's Aziz
[3:29:53] fishmeatx: Ye too much work and stress
[3:29:53] Grote_Meloen: More RP = More Daps
[3:29:54] Frog69: Sadge
[3:30:03] Juvraj: PD GO ON STRIKE
[3:30:05] random_viewer_55: @StevenB79 they are not a vote if it's less than 2 DAPs
[3:30:05] Shankaze: @khlaah for me thats fine, I'm jumping PoVs all the time to fill in on info KEKW just not waving it in Deans face
[3:30:08] roofrack1g: deansoLove2
[3:30:10] ramsin50: @Athasin she can't even give 3 daps with out other captains approval
[3:30:11] MasNLFC: It is stressful but I do like the cop conflict RP. Its spicy KEKW
[3:30:12] JxhnJxe: its fucked if everyone is gonna get dapped, because it means more to you then others since the ammount you have
[3:30:18] ffrenesii: I’m assuming DAPs are new right? haven’t tuned into any cop rp since middle of 3.0
[3:30:18] random_viewer_55: @StevenB79 less than 3*
[3:30:20] iwannanuhh: daps wouldnt be stressful if your captains were rational
[3:30:23] EGGZOLENTZ: @stevenb79 yeah but you cant really defend yourself or respresent honestly
[3:30:23] jak3jake: time to unionize
[3:30:25] StevenB79: When has it been less then 3
[3:30:26] npr3333: unionize the PD
[3:30:32] Busto1k: im trynna see dean quincy in the field on hood cuh fuck all that other shit
[3:30:39] jaxorts: Damn bro that clip is crazy
[3:30:51] misskierah_x: You've got this Dean, continue to be assertive ❤️
[3:30:52] EGGZOLENTZ: @stevenb79 they need a balance over reviewing them lik civ have
[3:30:56] Nadeflow: Ruth been hella 3.0 blud needs to pattern up
[3:31:00] ramsin50: @Athasin she also said he disobeyed an order by saying he will keep wearing his vest
[3:31:00] tigerprawn_za: RP is supposed to be fun not stressful, hopefully stuff improves going forward my man
[3:31:01] MrSaveAHo: Union
[3:31:02] Shankaze: the PD should have an unbiased DAP committee KEKW
[3:31:04] AlienatedFL: @Clivent I promise that was such a crazy escalation - where's the 'you do need my permission'
[3:31:04] m7eeeee: Hi
[3:31:07] bhawkins1302: they shouldnt fire people when they are already limited in staff
[3:31:08] adam_m3o: you just gonna sit here or play the game?
[3:31:09] toddthestarfox: need to eat ya an edible
[3:31:09] zac4e: @deansocool im 100% with you on how Officer Derolo acted, but do you ooc see the issue with riding in the g6 truck?
[3:31:12] Claxman2000: I mean even if the captains vote to not give you 3+, Ruth will just give you 2. Its just a shitty situation
[3:31:12] xypher85: @Athasin you here?
[3:31:13] toddthestarfox: jkjk
[3:31:14] Panos_97: I am sure he has nothing to worry about ngl, he's getting too stressed out without valid reason
[3:31:21] Zunnun: @murrig deano said he wasn't allowed to talk about it didn't wanna sht on derolo so he said sorry and left basically
[3:31:25] popcornispoggers: I think Aziz said it right yesterday, either everyone gets a punishment or no one does
[3:31:26] EGGZOLENTZ: @adam_m3o deansoP
[3:31:31] Athasin: @ramsin50 Yeah... that's an issue.
[3:31:36] xxlonegunmanxx: Harassment at work includes intimidation and i would say Ruth's continued behavior of giving out DaPs to a small select group of officers is a pattern of intimidation
[3:31:37] moe1124: yh
[3:31:42] moe1124: there aint no sop
[3:31:47] xo1k: exactly
[3:31:48] random_viewer_55: true
[3:31:48] zac4e: Aight, I hear you
[3:31:49] BDG_parth28: true
[3:31:51] moe1124: just a reprimand
[3:31:52] MAZIN_M_SAYEED: Exactly
[3:31:55] Panos_97: It shouldn't be DAPed that's kinda true
[3:31:57] 895k: an be framed
[3:31:58] Murrig: @Zunnun yeah that's what happened at the time. i think he needs to get a statement from jayson for this meeting though
[3:31:59] m4l1kkk: it was a safe operation.
[3:31:59] avoidschickens: just call Jean Paul and have him "handle" Ruth, then stage Dean to come save her, problem solved :D
[3:32:00] Athasin: @xypher85 Yeah, what's up?
[3:32:01] misskierah_x: For real
[3:32:02] Tenkaru: yeah that's silly
[3:32:03] JeePecks: She avoiding you
[3:32:03] 895k: but yk
[3:32:04] Frog69: Sadge  󠀀
[3:32:06] jake_barn: what does SOP stand for?
[3:32:07] Houtss: a simple your not suppose to do this. would have been fine
[3:32:08] jaxorts: Villain arc soon
[3:32:08] Shankaze: The DAP committee gets the DAP cases presented to them WITHOUT names, just cop 1, cop 2 etc. and hands out DAPs based on unbiased judgement
[3:32:08] ISaidYo2012: she seem sus
[3:32:09] zownedout: getting beat down by the man
[3:32:11] chivvyy: why are u so convinced about the daps lol they just talking

[3:32:13] 9trashpanda9: @xxlonegunmanxx this^^
[3:32:13] Strupset: @avoidschickens LUL
[3:32:14] ramsin50: @Deansocool that's only one dap i think
[3:32:15] slymox: Like Aziz was saying yesterday, the SOP's are being written as you're being DAPed
[3:32:19] bobbybeee: cant wait for this to all end..
[3:32:20] jake_barn: got it, ty
[3:32:23] JeePecks: What did Sheisty do for her to hate him?
[3:32:23] moe1124: W 27 MONTHS
[3:32:24] Claxman2000: yea it should be used as an example and teaching moment but no DAPs. Sonya should be demote and DAPed for losing her shit though.
[3:32:24] shae__void: @jake_barn standard operating procedure
[3:32:24] StevenB79: In the military you didn't NJP everyone who messed up you would council them on it so they learn
[3:32:25] volibearrr28: @avoidschickens That would be amazing rp xD
[3:32:27] BDG_parth28: Last half of a random 1 lifer to chill ?
[3:32:31] jazmaniandevi: It's not about what you know  it's what you can prove.
[3:32:32] timedoggg: whats happening to the "fuck off" officer?
[3:32:39] toddthestarfox: AINTNOWAY you’re gonna get dapped bro. it would be the downfall of pd
[3:32:41] npr3333: it's personal with denzel , there's no other explanation
[3:32:43] Scully_18: I just watched the whole situation again. Wait until it’s all done and they watch clips back and feel silly on her actions.
[3:32:43] VenomVeinZ: @timedoggg nothing
[3:32:46] MrFinnaNuts: Is a dap like a strike point?
[3:32:49] Juvraj: @Deansocool laws are not supposed to be retroactive
[3:32:50] Murrig: yeah if they don't like you being in the truck, it should just be a verbal warning or a discussion. not disciplinary
[3:32:50] xypher85: @Athasin dont dox your twitch in yt comments, there are some weirdos who will find your acc
[3:32:51] avoidschickens: @volibearrr28 zero to hero arc :P
[3:32:51] duckkyyducky: What i miss chat did den get daps?
[3:32:55] JJPowell73: DAP system is just not great for content either, I know it has to be there but it kinda rewards not doing much
[3:32:55] chivvyy: yes mrfinnanuts
[3:32:56] MAZIN_M_SAYEED: Even if it was wrong, it wasn't a massive fuckup
[3:32:57] flamingacegibbo: brother RP shouldn’t be this stressful, they need to ease up 100
[3:32:57] ItsTheRealRambo: @MrFinnaNuts yeh
[3:33:01] timedoggg: @VenomVeinZ really? lmao
[3:33:04] jake_barn: in the short couple weeks ive been watching i feel like theyre ALWAYS on your ass about some BS
[3:33:13] Fizban_The_Fabulous: deceDance
[3:33:13] Claxman2000: @timedoggg we don’t know. probably a DAP and nothing else
[3:33:21] Scully_18: When she drove off she nearly hit one of the officers at the back of the van too 😂
[3:33:24] TheHoll0w: @lunaleda sniper modCheck
[3:33:24] ramsin50: they are basically dapping her for saying fuckoff and dapping you for not staying safe
[3:33:25] slymox: My guess is everyone gets 1 DAP
[3:33:28] atlany: "Don't do that" would be 3 words. At that point they could as well give 3 daps lmao
[3:33:28] Clivent: :)
[3:33:28] Frog69: Sadge man fuck
[3:33:30] Athasin: @xypher85 I have no idea what that means

[3:33:32] fishmeatx: <3
[3:33:35] rozwiz: It's definitely personal with you I'm not sure if you did anything to Ruth or not but it seems she has people not just herself working against you
[3:33:35] EGGZOLENTZ: @deansocool how many hours in the minimum weekly
[3:33:37] Murrig: pretty sure everyone ooc knows this is ruth getting rid of officers that aren't "hers" so she can get power later on
[3:33:38] Juvraj: @slymox same
[3:33:38] BDG_parth28: @deansocool  genuine question , if there is so much unnecessary bs stress , is it even worth playing cop or atleast for now ?
[3:33:40] FabTheDuckOut: If its not in the SOPs, disagreements about conduct should result in professional discussion, not DAPS
[3:33:40] Claxman2000: Denzel didn’t put a period at the end of one of his sentences…. DAP
[3:33:47] moe1124: aight imma need some of u guys to chill
[3:33:49] xl_scout_lx: Get 3 DAP's, fired, sue the police department and Capt Ruth for wrongful termination, emotional distress, loss of wages, discrimination. Hire Ramee, EZ Clapz
[3:33:59] MAZIN_M_SAYEED: Neither Aziz nor Denzel should get a single DAP point
[3:34:00] popcornispoggers: You're not going after that guy?
[3:34:02] Shankaze: @Deansocool when u told De Rolo that u don't need her permission to speak to ur CI's, it was like u spat in her bobatea KEKW

[3:34:32] misskierah_x: @mazin_m_sayeed I agree, but she should her behaviour was unprofessional and uncalled for
[3:34:34] emma_louise2212: who decides if u get fired after the 10 daps is it still up to captains
[3:34:38] MAZIN_M_SAYEED: @Shankaze Denzel checked her and she got pissed

[3:34:55] SoggyM0uth: @emma_louise2212 pretty sure yes
[3:35:03] EGGZOLENTZ: @lunaleda respectfully shes a horrible leader
[3:35:03] MAZIN_M_SAYEED: @misskierah_x I said Denzel and Aziz
[3:35:06] ItsMagikzz: @emma_louise2212 goes to high command
[3:35:08] moe1124: @tokke2025 probably
[3:35:12] JJPowell73: 60 days to lose a DAP is wild as well - needs to be some way to either remove them or have them drop quicker

[3:35:49] sym2001: one lifer?
[3:35:52] danielb2705: Ohhhh sadge
[3:35:55] xxlonegunmanxx: Any good lawyer could get Harassment and Retaliation accusations to stick. and it would set precedents for the city on workplace hostility

[3:36:09] EGGZOLENTZ: I still dpnt see how she didnt get on trpuble for manbat incident
[3:36:13] MAZIN_M_SAYEED: @misskierah_x And in her case, if she wanted to yell at them, she should do that in a private setting rather than in public
[3:36:15] zac4e: Just make a pilot character like Poke and fuck around for 2 hours hryLafExceptInPain
[3:36:18] Janman88: if u atleast could do like a RP seminar or anything to decrease DAPs but it seems so OP
[3:36:21] Scully_18: Her character is understandable but it’s also supposed to be a game lol. Chill out ha
[3:36:24] toddthestarfox: Hood Robin links up with JP and just catch Ruth lmao
[3:36:25] patpaton: How did Ruth become a Captain?

[3:36:36] m4l1kkk: DQ with Larry and them deansoSpin
[3:36:37] Claxman2000: @xxlonegunmanxx yea it would be one thing if this stuff was handled evenly, but it seems to be targeted.

[4:14:59] StevenB79: Gal Bat
[4:15:12] kb420ps: I think the BIGGEST problem is, the Captains don't really want to stop crime.  They just want to slightly regulate it.  Denzel wants to stop crime,  and that's why they keep tying to slow him down.

[4:16:02] Claxman2000: @kb420ps See I see the biggest problem is the captains all disagree on how to run things and they spend more time arguing than doing police work.

[4:17:03] Cheexur: bro beat cops in uniform don’t investigate in that manner. how old are you?
[4:17:11] BDG_parth28: @cheexur  atop with the IRL shit , its a game at the end of the day , IRL people don't survive head shots from 9mm
[4:17:12] sendemup: PepeLaugh
[4:17:14] EGGZOLENTZ: @cheexur yeah but it should be 1 dap not 3

[4:17:57] mutantzombie01: @cheexur this is an rp server not real life they don’t have detectives what the police do is to better rp as a whole
[4:18:09] AbsolFC: sgtaLuna
[4:18:22] iiAM_AMAZiiN: does anyone know if the female captain streams?
[4:18:24] EGGZOLENTZ: @cheexur i think thatz the issue with the server. The conflict of being real and being a game. In reality since its a game it shouldve been your right its not there we'll update it tomrow
[4:18:36] cello_gus: i hope nekoda can do something on the oversight board to help with this
[4:18:37] Cheexur: @mutantzombie01 correct but it is based on irl which is clearly stated on server rules.
[4:18:38] DanLGG: y’all got valuable intel from that convo. they told you how the crims get those rolled bills

[4:19:22] danielwhite_2007: the question is why would Denzel yell at a Snr when his on 7daps like it doesn't matter
[4:19:24] fauxRothko: nmpO
[4:19:27] BDG_parth28: @cheexur  bruhhh
[4:19:34] mutantzombie01: @cheexur yes but not everything can be realistic especially when we think about content because at the end of the day this server is content focused due to its high popularity
[4:19:39] JJPowell73: Cpts should spot that the Senior has lied at times because DenZel as a character is always respectful to the ranking structure

[4:19:48] m4l1kkk: Lying on Den's name is insane
[4:19:55] macneutron: @danielwhite_2007 he actually didn't yell
[4:20:05] slymox: at 10 DAPs it's automatic review and possibly getting fired
[4:20:11] tadhgk24: bro i missed 3 streams because of storm and now bros getting fired???
[4:20:13] slymox: and he's at 7
[4:20:23] khrow: I feel so bad for Den, its like he's getting railroaded Sadge
[4:20:24] danielwhite_2007: yeah Ik that's why I'm wondering if Ruth truly believes he did
[4:20:27] izahkiel: STAND YOUR GROUND BROTHER
[4:20:38] BDG_parth28: @cheexur  dons get thrown og bridges , cars blow up in there faces , trians run them over , IRL but at end it's still a 13yr old game
[4:20:39] BalerionBlackDread: SOB
[4:20:49] EGGZOLENTZ: @cheexur you also have ppl driving cars in mountains and using game mechanics to get off. But overall the concept her not in trouble is insane
[4:20:52] Cheexur: they were told but Ruth to investigate. they could of rode one in a car the issue is they didn’t tell anyone and got inside a vehicle they were not supposed to. i don’t think Denzel should be getting that much daps for it but definitely disciplined.
[4:20:53] VoidTouch13: did he talk to cpt Turner or not chat?
[4:20:59] mannyman122: we need Waziz around

[4:23:06] mutantzombie01: @cheexur if we look at the characters they are both civs and are both high ranking in G6 and as such they should be seen as very well behaved people with little to no risk
[4:23:13] Murrig: if they believe her over you, then you will be
