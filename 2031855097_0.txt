[0:26:22] SadPeypey: maybe make VIP 100 bucks more if u do that
[0:26:31] goodguy2434: @screampack none

[0:28:24] bigolkielbasa: Loctite or plumbers thread tape would help
[0:28:28] screampack: @goodguy2434 yea but it's loans from an investor
[0:28:30] goodguy2434: @goodguy2434 an its diff person but marty still gets over 50% of profits after ppl r paid out
[0:28:38] Udeadman: @Udeadman Ahhh that makes more sense then
[0:28:43] onenutjake: @cozywarrior just a suggestion

[0:29:57] Stepanov370: @OTPMath not Marty's problem?
[0:29:57] Stealthy_Giraffe: pickle
[0:30:03] bigolkielbasa: @OTPMath That's not Marty's problem, he can up charge people for new sim's
[0:30:09] goodguy2434: @screampack it u read i said its diff per person...
[0:30:26] goodguy2434: watch the vods on it
