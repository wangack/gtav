[6:17:38] MonarchCreative: Has the colony installed the Spiked Ram yet?>
[6:17:41] Swiftwar_: lmao
[6:17:43] LieutenantDanzLegz: This game make me feel good.
[6:17:44] smoothiegroovy: @virethorn I will say BLEACH is extremely dead ended and the anime is so BLAH at the beginning. But if you saw what is in the manga and what they could do with the show, you’d be excited but I get your point uhnLol
[6:17:46] Delfryngr: winter monkaS
[6:18:02] Bossostrich305: @CannibalPuppies I hate the whole cast of characters in MHA but I don't think its terrible its meh
[6:18:02] MrSark101: winter sux Madge
[6:18:12] Virethorn: This guy had his chest blown open and then got right back up and was like 'You thought killing me would make me dead?' and then instagibbed the guy who beat him
[6:18:19] malkdepibe: Winter is the best
[6:18:28] MonarchCreative: Has the colony installed the Spiked Ram yet?
[6:18:38] Swiftwar_: I got tired of bleach when man lost his powers, to then gain new powers that are the same, then we found out he was like every species of special in existence and was just a god amongst man
[6:18:57] TipCheerio: That must be where Chalupa died
[6:18:58] Virethorn: @Swiftwar_ Okay, I'm gonna need a hard drink after reading that
[6:19:01] TankSpecOnly: kind of like guts in berserk his inner beast game out the he got 4x stronger
[6:19:03] MonarchCreative: Power creep kills most Super shows
[6:19:08] tbbqueen: @bossostrich305 Definitely not goated in terms of anime, but not complete trash either. If I’m being honest I probably only kept watching for the hot 2D men LUL

[6:19:26] Nightbot: Warning! This stream may feature bright lights! Those with Epilepsy or have special eyes be warned.
[6:19:29] sungiant_: power creep in opm though KEKW
[6:19:57] uhsoap: @tbbqueen should i even watch bleach ?
[6:20:00] smoothiegroovy: But bleach is my number 1 (it isn’t as good as others) but me personally I really enjoy it only because of the characters and fighting scenes. I also can actually watch their fillers
[6:20:00] Virethorn: no
[6:20:01] MonarchCreative: I love power creep, because I love special effects and cool powers, but it is hard on story
[6:20:03] CannibalPuppies: @bossostrich305 the show it self is like a strong 5 at most. It’s plot is so back tracked and the flash backs destroy it for me not to mention the non canon movies. I just can’t support it
[6:20:03] Swiftwar_: Yes

[6:20:55] tbbqueen: @uhsoap I think bleach was good for its time, but obviously now there are a lot of anime with better plot, animation, etc. I would say if you aren’t into it by the first few episodes it’s not gonna be your thing 100%

[6:21:45] Swiftwar_: I kinda just always recommend to watch the first 3 episodes of any anime, mainly 12-48 episode series
[6:21:46] MonarchCreative: I heard a lot of good things about One Piece, but MAN, SOoooo many eps to invest
[6:21:53] MonarchCreative: Thoughts?
[6:22:05] smoothiegroovy: @tbbqueen You have a good opinion about it, their budget for making bleach going against what profit they made of the show, really makes the achievement of that anime visible.
[6:22:08] Bossostrich305: @tbbqueen @CannibalPuppies yea a strong 5 at best but the characters made it so bad for me
[6:22:13] Virethorn: @MonarchCreative hello Apollo, where do I begin?
[6:22:19] Virethorn: Do you like Candy Land?
[6:22:26] TankSpecOnly: if I dont like a anime I just watch short clips of the anime just to get a quick some up of an episode
[6:22:32] tbbqueen: @monarchcreative I can’t commit because it’s so long!!! My good friend started watching and he LOVES it, but man there’s like over 1,000 episodes

[6:22:40] smoothiegroovy: I’ve never watched it tho
[6:22:44] toadeg: meep meep

[6:23:04] lost_leader: i enjoy Kengan Ashura
[6:23:14] CannibalPuppies: @bossostrich305 I don’t blame you. Your daughter Queenie loves the show uhnKek
[6:23:17] kebabinboi: one piece is worth the investment, it may seem like a lot but you can always think of each arc as 1 season and take it slowly 1 arc at a time BuddhaBar
[6:23:19] stukamod: KEKW weebs come out at dark
[6:23:19] Virethorn: One Piece literally had the longest anime fight of all time because they kept like... Leaving the fight to look a bunch of other things
[6:23:20] MonarchCreative: I want to find the diamonds in the rough to hook me
[6:23:21] tbbqueen: I always say watch AOT for beginning anime peeps @monarchcreative
[6:23:25] simonyin1: nice base
[6:23:30] Virethorn: like 63 episode long 1v1 fight
[6:23:32] MonarchCreative: @tbbqueen AOT?

[6:24:15] Virethorn: my first 3 anime things were... Vampire Hunter D, Akira and Barefoot Gen.
[6:24:18] Swiftwar_: if you are just looking for a good anime, there are shorter ones I recommend but if you want a long anime thats being relatively great through out its entirety then one piece is good
[6:24:20] 0xTas: KEKLEO
[6:24:20] smoothiegroovy: Foreshadowing + character development it’s good fucking soup yk

[6:30:03] Swiftwar_: when he said "shelves here" I thought of "PILLS HERE" Bill from L4D
[6:30:03] smoothiegroovy: makes sense
[6:30:26] smoothiegroovy: @tbbqueen Is whataburger not open?
[6:30:31] smoothiegroovy: I thought that’s like 24/7
[6:30:36] Swiftwar_: it just rang out the same.

[6:34:12] tbbqueen: @only1canoli Complete inexcusable and they deserve a uhnBan
[6:34:42] smoothiegroovy: my city would probably throw tantrums if McDonald’s or whataburger didn’t do 24/7 that’s where all the drunks go uhnFine uhnKek

[7:35:31] CensoredTH0ughTs: you guys are ready to fight a war LUL
[7:35:33] CannibalPuppies: @tankspeconly I’m sure someone has a mod for that
[7:35:58] Decimated_exo: theirs armory already is overflown with ammo and weapons
[7:36:00] Stretch2099V2: how does smoking affect the player?
[7:36:05] RolosGaming_CH: @CannibalPuppies might be against TOS but possibly yeah
[7:36:13] RolosGaming_CH: @Stretch2099V2 I think the same in GTA RP

[7:36:28] Stretch2099V2: @rolosgaming_ch I don't know it
[7:36:43] kogbe: @Stretch2099V2 if you have the smoking trait, it reduces unhappiness and stress
[7:36:43] CannibalPuppies: @rolosgaming_ch against Twitch GL? Or this game in general?
[7:36:47] RolosGaming_CH: @Stretch2099V2 reduces stress anxiety and removes depression, an all in one negative trait remover

[7:37:31] TheQueenPh0enix: nah the forrest is fine so i wouldnt see why it would be differant for this game
[7:37:38] Seiggray: @franzuuu server reset
[7:37:45] RolosGaming_CH: @DeeplyRootedTre3 Have it on and its more stable than the build 41.56
[7:37:49] wallsgunna: @DeeplyRootedTre3 yeah they said the majority of people were playing b41 so they just made it the main build
[7:38:07] CannibalPuppies: @rolosgaming_ch the game I could see it but towards twitch I mean I’ve seen Marco do his cannibal bits on stream before uhnKek with questionable body parts in his inventory
[7:38:31] Decimated_exo: can bus get a trailer hooked up too?
[7:38:55] RolosGaming_CH: @CannibalPuppies LMAO, then there might be a possibility for a cannibal RP
[7:38:57] kogbe: @CannibalPuppies cannibalism is a part of the mod called hydrocraft which will be updated to the current branch soon
[7:38:59] CensoredTH0ughTs: @RolosGaming_CH @wallsgunna i think that will help keep some new players b40 and b41 are so different

[7:39:44] TheQueenPh0enix: calling someone a ritz NOPERS cannibalism NODDERS
[7:39:48] RolosGaming_CH: @DeeplyRootedTre3 Just based on the mods listed in the workshop I can imagine it being super different.
[7:39:52] CannibalPuppies: @kogbe Nice jeannn1Sip
[7:40:28] RolosGaming_CH: @CannibalPuppies Just to keep it spicy there'll be an arc for that.
[7:40:54] ltkovian: every time I see the map, it's just so intimidating, looks so massive
[7:41:02] meatyhornedfrog: Why does james collect the leathers? Kink?

[7:43:30] reCoil8: COGGERS
[7:43:31] hxzzafxtzo: @hazzabazzagazza yeah but the taillights it has look identical to the demon
[7:44:24] selfDisgust: you talking about the raid?
[7:44:33] CannibalPuppies: @rolosgaming_ch not that I’m doubting it but yes it is a possibility. Regardless though I mean I don’t think it would cross over. If it did that’s just Marco doing it for giggles chalupaSippy

[7:48:00] Decimated_exo: barely anything
[7:48:14] Ownager: I wonder what the big gains are for Tailoring then
[7:48:16] FlubHub: tailoring is truly the suffering of this game

[7:50:19] RolosGaming_CH: @FlubHub JFC thats some grinding.
[7:50:31] oliverrustariz: what are leather strips good for?
[7:50:34] TimingTell: it'll be better when tailoring is actualy implemented
[7:50:35] RolosGaming_CH: I think having VHS tapes for tailoring also helps speed the process up.
[7:50:39] RolosGaming_CH: @oliverrustariz leather armor
[7:50:44] FlubHub: @RolosGaming_CH just did it so i can restore the clothing i like to the original appearnce
