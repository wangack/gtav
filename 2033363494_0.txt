[2:29:11] mugcostanza: kyliebCozy
[2:29:14] Isen_Mage: it'd be like the mm site, where it acts as a tool to help kick off the actual buy/sell RP

[2:30:23] Khaza_: It's no different than sending a text. It's just more convenient. People still gotta meed up for the deal.
[2:30:25] Delaser: Its litterally just a standin for a spreadhseet for keeping track of shit without having to risk doxxing people's gmail accounts.
[2:30:25] cshunter2069: out of game tools that enhance rp, is POG
[2:30:31] shpuddie: at most it save like 5 sec of a phone call and even then
[2:30:33] Khaza_: *meet
[2:30:43] poppins1729: It enables RP because it prompts contact.

[5:43:58] HotCocoaGamer: Idk how Vinny thinks Dundees antics would be beneficial for him.
[5:44:01] ThePitfallover: the race to the bottom stuff was the sign that he wasn't willing to play ball
[5:44:02] KewlKittyProductions: difference is, hers was truth, theirs is lies
