Theres stuff goin' on in the background (Nino for example had a big thing with Eugene being in 'the 9s' and had a deep discussion with the Judges / other Lawyers)

[7:04:42] Skechup: If anything, you could probably still deal in small amounts when the 'kingpin' gets jailed since there might still be a supply still remaining from stockpiles and shit.
[7:04:50] slpperysloth: Like just brushing it off or not making it a big deal cause the police need proof which is true but should fear of what could be happening
[7:05:22] aznfriendz33: wont be able to sell coke for a while in 3.0 with money wipe

[7:05:45] MetaSaiko: they made a smart move rping it that way though, there's people irl that do stupid shit like that
[7:05:52] xRomaine: Obviously Harvey was being watched by the PD if he was caught doing a drop, I wouldn't be surprised if JTF is just going down the list and investigating everyone on it 1 by 1
