[1:34:21] SwyfteWinter: Yeah! Screw the old system!
[1:34:27] SwyfteWinter: See you in 5!
[1:34:33] DucksQ: @JudeIzBeard Split ratios might change
[1:35:09] JudeIzBeard: @JudeIzBeard For the bars? Yeah probably
[1:35:28] JaffaMod: We're now going for an ad break that will last up to 5 minutes. Make sure you subscribe ( twitch.tv/yogscast/subscribe ) to not see them anymore!
[1:35:43] PomegranateOfPain: @DucksQ Update 8 has that I think in the new game settings? That or you can do it via the save editor on the calculator/map website.
[1:35:50] echo1937: 2 raiders from echo1937 have joined! 
[1:36:31] DucksQ: @PomegranateOfPain Maybe I'll try playing again then, I feel like the harddrive collection totally breaks the game loop and it's bad game design

[1:38:23] PomegranateOfPain: @DucksQ I personally feel like the drive collection is fine to encourage exploring, but I hate that you choose one of 3 random recipes when SO many alt recipes are pretty garbage. If it was unlocking a tech tree of alt recipes like the MAM just costing hard drives it would be much better.
[1:40:03] 4MaFantasticBooty: PogChamp
[1:40:36] DucksQ: @PomegranateOfPain For me it feels like you just already need to explore for material nodes and stuff. I don't want to have to spend hours exploring to find a recipe that may or may not exist instead of working on my factory setup because there's an alternate method out there that makes things far less complicated.
[1:41:18] SneakyTurt1e: I don't think it's "bad game design" It does serve its purpose of forcing exploration and using the scanner but yeah I'm agreed that maybe there could be a better way to do it, game is in early access still and might change still don't forget
[1:41:44] SneakyTurt1e: Tbh there's nothing else important enough to actually force the player to explore the whole map
[1:42:39] JudeIzBeard: Having a look into the alt recipes and maybe make them better/feel less random would be huge
[1:43:09] PomegranateOfPain: @DucksQ Yeah, I think the MAM showing you which alt recipes exist as you unlock them as a chooseable option would be a lot better. Right now you have to go look at a wiki just to see what alt recipes are even out there to have a chance at randomly unlocking.
[1:44:40] boca_leche: double audio?
[1:44:57] DucksQ: @SneakyTurt1e Well in that case isn't it just a patch on top of an existing problem to force players to explore? I wouldn't have a problem with it if they made resource nodes more sparse and having some focus in certain areas (which it is to an extent at the moment), but as is it feels like they've just put it there to explore because they want people to do that even though there's no need?
