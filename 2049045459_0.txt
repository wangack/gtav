[4:48:41] PyroViking_: but you were hunting them first
[4:48:45] Frakkles: Maybe one of those a day?
[4:48:48] thedrdent: well you technically did all the work getting him so in this scenario it makes sense
[4:48:49] Livelethal: As long as that isn't all you're doing, but like... high fines and a good tip every so often wouldn't be bad
[4:48:49] yoyomancoolman: there is no hunt in that imo
[4:48:50] boolove: might as well be a cop at that point
[4:48:50] the_quik1: It takes away from the content
[4:48:51] GreasedM0nkey: Yeah you shouldn't get shit unless YOU actually catch em
[4:48:51] DrNycoleGreen: How are Bounty Hunter's paid IRL?
[4:48:52] Bendosuff: @Kyle but you found them, they commited crime after you told them to pay it up
[4:48:52] lids_etc: thechiefDance thechiefDance
[4:48:53] f4rt3mis: jail camp ?
[4:48:54] PhantomRogue: yeah, then its the cops taking a useless step to call a BH, then the BH collects a free fine
[4:48:56] 11km11: Not as cool. Thats for sure
[4:48:57] Diyal0000: it makes sense if you were involved in it, not randomly
[4:49:00] OverGiant: it seems to create some RP for the cops, crims and bounty hunters involved.  Seems especially legit when the cops reach out to you
[4:49:00] LoopeeDK: id rather have prison camping than going down to cells
[4:49:01] stryktron: yeah, but in this case they kinda got cought becasue of you
[4:49:02] one_two_x_you730: But you would have to establish the RP with the cops to know they are in the cells though
[4:49:04] yerilious: you were a "part" of the arrest, don't see a problem with it
[4:49:08] harvesterofthesea: mybe its like an alley-oop in that situation LUL
[4:49:09] Obi_Wan_Jabroni: maybe it's worth making the cops hate you so they don't want to help KEKW
[4:49:10] jeff32019: i see most people fighting back though resulting in them arrested anyway no?
[4:49:11] Apell0: i rather there are 10000 uncollected fines if the rp is better
[4:49:12] Meatyfrog: The problem is Kyle everytime they shoot at you they get charged with new crimes, but the never pay off the other crimes
[4:49:12] LiftedGN: if yuou let it be complimentary it could be aight, just dont let it turn into that
[4:49:16] Mantelrorelsen: Just to show some power. Take a fresh photo for the hunt...
[4:49:18] punishedmatt: If you initiate the whole thing though, and the PD get involved because they escalate, thats on them.
[4:49:18] GreasedM0nkey: Bounty Hunters are for when cops can't find the crims not just doing cop work
[4:49:23] SamzieNA: sanctioned fight club winner get his fines paid by state
[4:49:23] xFREELANCER911x: exactly you found them
[4:49:24] CannibalSnacks: Hat Carl was a hero!
[4:49:28] notparanoidbut: NODDERS
[4:49:29] mrlemons: HERES MY TAKE AS A CHATTER YAPPP
[4:49:31] Livelethal: As long as cops aren't just calling you on every single arrest w/ fines, I think it's alright
[4:49:32] audiyomind: testing in production kyleisHYPERS
[4:49:33] KillScotty: Onx is the shit
[4:49:36] AntiFusion: science mfers NODDERS
[4:49:36] xFREELANCER911x: you‚Äôll fix it figure it out
[4:49:38] Obi_Wan_Jabroni: trial and error NODDERS only way to learn
[4:49:40] thedrdent: there are people who abuse chopping ingredients as a mechanic as well, so its just about being honest and punishing people abusing it imo
[4:49:41] BartelleJ: if it's unrelated to you it should be off the table
[4:49:41] Mediamessiah: Will you guys experiment with civ jury for bench trials?
[4:49:46] xZailious: to a degree having/creating relationships with certain cops can maybe allow that
[4:49:47] punishedmatt: All they had to do was not hunt you for sport after you told them you were coming to collect
[4:49:50] Oppositeness: Cop server NODDERS t
[4:49:55] swaghetti77: But the UI NOOOO
[4:49:56] koni05: But but but the UI
[4:49:57] Percaholic187: are bounty hunter able to hold people in custody or no?
[4:49:59] koni05: LUL LUL LUL
[4:50:00] Spicy_McChickens: Just take my things and let me go
[4:50:04] one_two_x_you730: Pushing the envelop without mechanics perse is how you keep RP fresh... BUT THE FUCKING UI
[4:50:05] thelad2ndchance: If it's someone the bounty hunter hunts down and is involved in the capture of, it feels like fair game to me
[4:50:06] codcium: when are store robberies
[4:50:06] anas_89: Mantis Day when ??
[4:50:08] KillScotty: whoever came up with the queue pausing feature is a genius @kyle
[4:50:13] jf_tie: if you use police resources pays less
[4:50:16] Sykum: juries don't won't work in RP
[4:50:16] vantarts: keeping the UI happy
[4:50:17] IanthEdegen: I feel like it's fair game if you were chasing them beforehand. If you were just waiting for the police to call you without doing anything, that'd be different.
[4:50:24] Mantelrorelsen: He needs a cage at his office
[4:50:40] boolove: like Mel in 2.0
[4:50:41] mio_ottawa: Dundee did that
[4:50:42] Livelethal: Good RP with a few cop connections for tips etc makes it interesting.
[4:50:43] AtomicXIII: JFTV will pay his debt! thechiefW
[4:50:49] MindbenderDK: YOU SAID ASS lul
[4:50:51] yoDeRock: what if you bounty hunt the bounty hunters to pay your fines PEPW
[4:50:51] Astral_Walkerer: That's why you have the rings!!
[4:50:59] stryktron: If PD arrest someone u had nothing to do with and then call u to collect fines, thats shitty in my opinion, if they got cought because of you its fine.
[4:51:02] GreasedM0nkey: I've missed watching your RP, but god damn do I not miss the Drama that comes with it
[4:51:03] xwarnpeacex: need carbonite to freeze your marks
[4:51:05] harvesterofthesea: wasnt mel like 2 mill in debt with a lambo lol
[4:51:08] PRONE: Pred was what, $11 million in debt KEKW
[4:51:08] vantarts: bounty hunter office soon Prayge
[4:51:19] lids_etc: thechiefDance
[4:51:31] drag_like_pull: @boolove I miss Mel. I miss space boy. he‚Äôs been MIA for a while now
[4:51:39] TheFabilolz: @PRONE With loans, not fines
[4:51:39] Sykum: workhouse
[4:51:39] dr_plox: dr_plox subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! 
[4:51:49] SistematicalNoDestroyer: cobalt could let to put people in debt in citys bank
[4:51:50] LoopeeDK: you go into jail and make license plates NODDERS
[4:52:00] stryktron: yeah, its definitely something to think about.
[4:52:09] PRONE: @TheFabilolz yeah same situation though, he just stopped caring cuz he was so fucked
[4:52:10] Bolinko: bail + ankle tracker that goes off if they aren‚Äôt working a legit job at least 2 hours a day
[4:52:18] krooguh: Cobalt dead? Or that RP gonna be-emerge?
[4:52:19] Aary: you should buff the economy, like make 5k in 4hours with every job in the city
[4:52:20] krooguh: re~
[4:52:21] The_Warrior1: thechiefDance
[4:52:23] one_two_x_you730: Consequences are good for RP regardless
[4:52:23] xwarnpeacex: po officers
[4:52:32] Meatyfrog: @Aary that just makes inflation insane
[4:52:33] tiryanos: Mike Block PEPW
[4:52:36] SamzieNA: nah you can't buff the econ that hard
[4:52:36] Doogli: once crime starts paying more issues will lessen slightly
[4:52:37] tigerpapa9: I think trading fines for prison time, would help get rid of debt and force a little prison RP, giving the DOC some real work.
[4:52:54] MaximumEagle: Some more RP focused community services would be good, I don't think that sweeping DMV does that, but then again, i don't know jack
[4:52:54] SamzieNA: honestly sean will change pay structures for roles and then new businesses opening will do more
[4:52:59] SamzieNA: people will have more money soon
[4:53:02] krooguh: Chief will never pay his fines :)
[4:53:04] MentallyAdorable: the police could collect unpaid fines when they arrest ppl, then no reason to call bounty hunters down to cells
[4:53:08] DrNycoleGreen: That's where you take property and bank accounts...
[4:53:17] one_two_x_you730: It's like you say to the police investigating. No point speculating just run with the broad strokes and philosophy. then deal with the facts and problems as they arise
[4:53:21] Aary: yeah but you can buff the fines in like 2-3month after that
[4:53:27] boozy15: I AM A DOG KEKW
[4:53:31] Sweets_64: I mean crims need ways to make money though so they can actually pay their fines
[4:53:46] one_two_x_you730: @Sweets_64 Don't get caught
[4:53:52] Rediskoff: prison job grinders
[4:54:10] Sweets_64: @one_two_x_you730 what a stupid answer KEKW
[4:54:10] one_two_x_you730: @Sweets_64 Also suing the state when they overstep
[4:54:11] MaximumEagle: I also think that if people can't pay their fines, but come forward on their own, should be looked at more liniently
[4:54:16] SamzieNA: yeah but if theres a crim update then theres more money to be made potentially same w civ update to jobs and pay structure
[4:54:19] SamzieNA: its all good stuff
[4:54:21] SamzieNA: slow burn baby
[4:54:26] KillScotty: i would gladly work them off and RP with people to save money on fines
[4:54:44] MrTraceer: honestly a tracker for those that prove unwilling to pay may be best option to make sure they do their community service
[4:54:55] tteckk123: Guess i throw in my paragraph. seems to me they have to have a cutout system, if fines owed are too much over too long a time they have to go to jail. That way they have the opportunity to come right, and if they cant the system forces it. kyleisShrug
[4:54:59] bigg504: the guy with the 15,000

[6:20:08] Bigusacokis: YEP
[6:20:09] romanrripper: Hat produces some top notch RP
[6:20:16] tac0z805: its great, gives crimes and cops something to do
[6:20:17] skoadx: reforming from jail experience?
[6:20:18] SirSaltyBacon: Only feedback I have is someway to have a cap just so there are not 50 BHs after you at once.
[6:20:21] Danglypooters: you can go from fingle dan to officer fingle dan
[6:20:21] kingrobillard321: every new thing has some kinks to work out only takes time
[6:20:25] ascendantben: kyleisMega_HF

[6:20:34] LoopeeDK: im just interested in alot of the civ stuff cus i think way to many servers turn into cops and robbers
[6:20:35] activ00: At some point cops will try to arrest you because they get annoyed I think
[6:20:35] mookieslastxmas: they killed my best friend they killed my best friend
[6:20:39] stryktron: @Kyle its great so far but what when like 5 gangs start hunting u down for "rewange" ?
[6:20:39] columbothelieutenant: It just sucks you can't have a lot of them, so not many people will have the opportunity to try it
[6:20:40] ByteMyWire: kyleisHmm It's a good counter to the peeps that say fuck paying fines
[6:20:46] Obi_Wan_Jabroni: i like the idea of crims having to be civ for a little while and potentially taking different routes, whether it be staying a crim or not.
[6:20:47] Bigusacokis: irrational decisions sometimes lead to rational discussions and changes
[6:20:50] Oppositeness: @SirSaltyBacon that'd be great. cant take another BH's hit either
[6:20:52] AntiFusion: the last crims at the docks showed the potential it has if it's enabled and you guys did
[6:20:55] Dang3rFluff: Hat Carl just needs a better car than this rustyass shitbucket @Kyle
[6:21:00] SirSaltyBacon: I would be so excited to be hunted on Steve
[6:21:02] Bigusacokis: gangs RP as gangs
[6:21:08] PyroViking_: NODDERS

[6:21:16] anextremeemo: not all blacked out in motorcycle helmets
[6:21:18] mrlemons: Gangs on ONX have been (mostly) very cool
[6:21:19] Conorwayne: I think you playing Carl has been great because there was alot of pushback early on bounty hunting so people seemed hesitant
[6:21:19] Slesh5: even that ambush was cool af compared to a boring drive by
[6:21:21] Venenare: definitely a step forward
[6:21:30] anextremeemo: HEY HAT *shoot guns* EZ

[6:21:38] yoyomancoolman: that ambush was cool af tbh
[6:21:44] one_two_x_you730: The server has mostly good eggs tbh
[6:21:50] OctoNox: I think some sort of BH dispatch would solve the problem of having multiple people going after you at once
[6:21:51] xXSnitzleXx: Maybe try setting the bounties up. More strategic and less ambush/run and gun
[6:21:52] MaximumEagle: Damn, like a reporter job would be fire
[6:21:53] stryktron: They are this far but now that u fucked them, will they still be cool with it or will they maybe try to pull guns earlier
[6:22:04] ChaosFoxInyx: @kyle can you replay the clip of the ambush?
[6:22:06] mrlemons: @Paralyzed_dog I'd imagine it's got something to do with Dog being a giant POS
[6:22:07] one_two_x_you730: @OctoNox I don't think there is a problem
[6:22:08] BartelleJ: GSF only got arrested because they hit those 2 people PEPW
[6:22:13] Suhlurpy: Its nice that not everyone is running around with motorcycle helmets or masks
[6:22:15] bubbakush1245: is the trailer park still a thing
[6:22:22] SirSaltyBacon: Turns out working to fix the bad apples works better than removing/changing the mechanics.
[6:22:26] SirSaltyBacon: Who wouldve thunk it.
[6:22:36] Bigusacokis: @bubbakush1245 yeah, it's still sitting there
