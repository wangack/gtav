[0:34:28] LORDPUNISHR: Kilo watts
[0:34:30] twistedtrixxter: @ray__c what do you think about maybe a home owners guide/manual when you purchase one that explains stuff, especially the power stuff and if it'll cause a house fire because that seems weird to be so unexpected if you can lose everything in a random fire lol
[0:34:32] graxas: it  makes no sense for the house to have no lights...
[0:34:33] blackpilIed: what’s up ray gonna be a salesman today?
[0:34:33] themonstaking: Its the little lights you have everywhere
[0:34:33] Delloga: If having a realistic house costs so much, then the price of the power is way to high

[0:34:46] TheAirWalker: kitchen = 10, lights = 3, PCs have to be way more than 10
[0:34:47] PwnUWithEz: How crazy would it be if there was rare furniture like paintings etc.. which maybe grant some bonuses to your char like extra crafting. And then a black market is created where robbing houses is a big thing...
[0:34:48] Edbrooke75: good morning Ray!

[1:38:48] monsef: @jgrace26 only 4
[1:38:49] ヒクトル: maybe house has base power spending depending on its size? @Ray__C
[1:38:49] Mi1ox: And the funniest thing is you dont know the amount on taxes ? @Ray__C
[1:38:51] jinkleft: Seems like a good idea to display the metadata in the UI for the consumption stats when you select an item
[1:38:53] raj_r997: Someone stealing your power
[1:38:53] lordmirza: Maybe the ghost of that electric car x wanted to buy is using the rest of the pwer
[1:38:54] HazzmannTTV: had to share it with some friends to show what RP is like

[2:50:51] dharma77: end these clowns
[2:50:53] ghostkiller631: @prometheus_alghul depends on the situation normally its scene based but can be more like getting Blooded out of a gang they forget everything about the gang

[2:51:49] leclecleclec: @prometheus_alghul it’s up to them but it’s usually erase their memories of the events leading up to the ocean dump but ultimately it is their choice on what to remember plus it’s easy to piece it together like if he called someone before saying I think I’m going to die and they know it’s over pcs they can figure it out
