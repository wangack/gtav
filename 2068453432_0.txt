[8:11:52] billasensei: THIS SERVER IS CRAXY, HOW CAN YOU SCRIPT THIS XD
[8:11:54] kuwwoo: KEKW
[8:11:55] AbacusRay: @athasin ya he was. he took all the usbs he needed to try and trade with OTT. OTT said nah I don’t want USBs I want my GPUs back. X went back to the house and Marty took his USBs back. this was all after X called Marty and said he was going to take the USBs and go on with or without Marty. So wether X was joking or not, Marty was robbed
