[0:10:41] Shivie78: These things are difficult. You gotta ask the streamer i guess, they put time and effort into it. They need the income from all the adds ofc. If lots of people just co stream it they loose income. Twitch can say, sure you can. But they aint doing the event. Its QT.

[0:45:40] Wesker889: are you going to be the usb runner again or is it eugene?
[0:45:41] larkan111: @Tenivir constantly swapping roles gets very confusing though
[0:45:42] DesignII: @vazeline__ you should log in to No Pixel and tell them then
[0:45:43] ChrisGodwinHere: EUGENE IS THE BEST DRIVER
[0:45:46] DaveShadows: mhm would it be an assault charge if you threw the coins at the cops
[0:45:50] popaz_: @iHarsh29 yeah but they need to get them to practice while its still smaller heists LUL
[0:45:54] vazeline__: @nikulaz_ The problem is he can’t plan because he doesn’t understand the heist.

[0:47:32] AsianStyle86: @joac1144 it was the most used spot in 3.0 lol
[0:47:37] HeftyNYC: tbh raia being a driver is scary only bc of her scuff/ping

[0:52:51] nikulaz_: Its because raia is talking
[0:52:51] Pepejaa: HDMI
[0:52:53] ironbullman: She is thinking of rp maybe
[0:52:54] ashleyferns: With Flippy even the best cops wont catch you
[0:52:55] Zann41: cops are pretty fast this days
[0:52:55] 13theux: just need backup on top of one tho
[0:52:57] HandofOdd: 3 overwhelms them, yes
[0:52:57] marcohiguera01: That's part of the fun lol
[0:53:01] loekup: Cops will most of the times follow the the car with the most people
[0:53:01] elusivetreecko: it’s always easy lol
[0:53:01] dredraider: agree 2
[0:53:04] dredraider: not 3
[0:53:06] dnlinhares: they will focus on 1 car, instead of 2, but with flippy easy escape
[0:53:06] joac1144: @glorfindel1111 the cops that are around at this time are not
[0:53:08] BoomerPaw: peepoJail LOCKED UP
[0:53:09] IggleGreen: Last second planning again. POGGERS
[0:53:10] azncheesy: Kappa it feels like Vee getting overconfident
[0:53:11] ViolentRoy: yeah flippy knows so much
[0:53:12] Dumi90: yes
[0:53:13] DustonKing: it would go smooth and easy without raia
[0:53:13] Justinthewood5: yes tell them
[0:53:15] florda: you are correct
[0:53:16] pilhass10: the less people in the getaway car with the loot better no?
[0:53:17] Flugger1: yo guys
[0:53:18] Dumi90: thats very good
[0:53:19] SteeG: It's all nerves probably from not being an experienced crew.

[0:53:38] Jboourns001: You're right Eugene said the same thing
[0:53:39] BoJackJohnsson: Only Flippy and Granpa should talk about this. They are the drivers
[0:53:42] mavericks312: Eugene isn’t prioritzing ppl not getting felonies he needs his car empty to get the loot out
[0:53:42] Tuga_cef: @Miinst ikr LULW
[0:53:44] GamingAudioBook: HDMI gang
[0:53:44] Stewy21: It's always Raia it seems
[0:53:48] deltron__: Remember nunu said listen to the leader and go with the plan even if it's wrong
[0:53:56] loekup: the problem with 4 people jumping is it will switch the focus to the other car + 4 people hopping in takes longer than 1 person hopping in
[0:53:57] Zann41: interesting angle
[0:54:02] Mr_Tvi: Valid point, weight doesn't matter after the passenger
[0:54:03] Miinst: yes, at least 2 from right side jump and its gg
[0:54:07] azncheesy: Raia the doubt queen
[0:54:07] Divine_Saint: cant 4get the loot is heavy, 1 person cant carry everything

[0:54:31] blazeyaquick: good morning acie
[0:54:32] Tuga_cef: fr the heist needs to have one leader only, if everyone keeps chippin in ideias during heist will create confusion
[0:54:35] mavericks312: @mr_tvi 1 passenger is the same as 4
[0:54:37] SteeG: Both times have been pretty smooth already. The Raia situation last time was just a bit shitty. Not much you coudl've done there.
[0:54:38] Ace_aut: Oceans 6
[0:54:40] Shivie78: raia aint gonna be there, as she is a getaway driver

[0:57:28] Tenivir: yeah 3 people swapping can get messy
[0:57:29] flybynite98: too many cooks in the kitchen
[0:57:30] SteeG: getting out on the opposite side does sometimes just get smacked by a pd car
[0:57:30] MRavty: Ye that makes sense
[0:57:32] balancedtofu: or just get 1 in the trunk no one on the left
[0:57:36] piyuoo: 100%
[0:57:38] mectuka: any passenger makes the car slower doesn't matter if 1 or 3
[0:57:38] printerman22: right hand side only, eugene should keep left person

[3:30:13] kwznv: ????
[3:30:15] adamm220: vee has been more assertive lately
[3:30:17] jonty1998: v and tolan can’t be the only grinder’s
[3:30:19] jmanpowerhousee: need Nunu back
[3:30:22] qihk: or just beg people to make ads on twatter to buy materials
[3:30:22] ashleyferns: Aren't you the 300 stars collector, you must have contacts.
[3:30:23] mishegas: raids could be prepared earlier (materials)
[3:30:24] TopicTech: civ gang tryouts would be some good RP

[3:30:31] optymyst1cpryme: thats what yall need fr, associates
[3:30:35] h0lk1: That's what Jason is trying to do lol but yeah
[3:30:39] LaCucaracha7: without vee this group would be nowhere. empty house, no 6060's and still waiting on a callback from Lang
[3:30:41] vmjama: Eugene already sees you as the second in command
[3:30:41] shivang1497: you need more members or y'all are just gonna burn out
[3:30:48] qihk: I dont think civ gang has put any ads up for buying materials.
[3:31:06] Nulltiply: U about ot die btw
[3:31:08] BoJackJohnsson: I have watch some Dizzy streams and the grind that he and Larry do is insane. They run Sani for like 18h for days
[3:31:10] misemivice: Vee do your own sub group. Just find lonely groupless people and run it like a mob
[3:31:14] TheOxKing682: I mean Jason's tries too, but he doesn't really assert his dominance...he's too relaxed wit it.
[3:31:19] unknown_butcher: I think you vee and Larry make a habit of working together you'll get 300 quick
[3:31:25] Fabio10296: toaln
[3:31:26] Heezmagnif: this is where the minions come in
[3:31:26] Tenivir: you just need to try to get people farming mats strictly for you for reliable buying but slight discount

[3:31:36] paomely06: patar?*
[3:31:36] Waywardd: Seems like you guys need to branch out
[3:31:40] Villenthessis: need to explore around the city too meet new people or grinders
[3:31:44] PenguinJutsu: put your foot down, you're the one doing all the work, it's not fair
[3:31:44] SavingGrace: i feel like tolan would do it if he had prio
[3:31:45] jmanpowerhousee: make a group inside of the group
[3:31:47] ZitroneSimo: I think Tolan would do it if he gets in
[3:31:48] FRAlex010: well than its youur job to recruit a sani grinder
[3:31:52] girlballor: this week is just gone maybe next week when nunu is back everyone will be back at it.

[3:32:49] PenguinJutsu: its always Vee and Tolan, the others need to step up lol
[3:32:50] elusivetreecko: @acie try creating different story lines. like Mr K. start doing business stuff. You guys are in a position of logging on and doing the same thing with the same people. eventually it starts burning you guys out.
[3:33:11] nicky_nr: that jump is to lad on the ramp
[3:33:11] optymyst1cpryme: easier with car or bike
[3:33:13] letboot: MONKA oh god
