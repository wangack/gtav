[1:02:18] retrowolf0498: All I know is if Tessa get blooded out by Vito. He's going to die in clown court.
[1:02:28] ApocAFK: Tessa is 'leaving' the Italians, even though she was never officially 'in' @morganclay40
[1:02:36] QuesoCommander: I stepped away for a bit, what was the context of the "consequences"?

[1:05:00] retrowolf0498: I think a call to Luciano to let him know of the situation would beneficial as well. Maybe he can talk some sense into Vito.
[1:05:01] OrestesTheSloth: Too bad you can't bring Acheron to the meeting
[1:05:13] vipersummer: is it bad that i small part of me hopes they try.... just so that people will get a glimpse of the real Tessa and take her more serious
[1:05:26] ApocAFK: I won't lie, I had a sinking feeling that the family wouldn't work for Tessa ever since that first meeting where Luciano left

[1:13:09] vipersummer: yeah im not going to lie, it makes me smile knowing the Italians are losing the disarm codes to the nuke that is Juno
[1:13:18] retrowolf0498: Breaking the news to everyone close to her is going to be fun. It's going to turn into a dumpster fire

[1:15:07] jimothy64: Juno already being on edge from the whole Jerry thing.. she's gonna blow.. question is whether it's externally or internally focused
[1:15:21] birdipea: BOOBA
[1:15:40] retrowolf0498: Probably since Vito caused it, it's going to be focused on him and Carlo.
[1:17:00] birdipea: Loadingg
[1:18:25] ApocAFK: DEVS! nakkiMega
[1:18:49] Mimsy34: they couldn't pull out trucks at the tsunami, so there was a restart but i guess it broke the dashboard
[1:19:02] dinoroaria: nakkiTired
[1:19:12] JoeayIV: now ask him how he'd feel if someone pulled 50k out of thin air
[1:19:27] dinoroaria: nakkiVERYNOTFINE
[1:21:12] ApocAFK: pepeLaugh Wonder what this could possibly be
[1:21:23] retrowolf0498: Perfect. She can put them all on blast.
[1:21:57] dinoroaria: onaroll
[1:22:03] ApocAFK: onaroll
[1:22:05] JoeayIV: P A I N

[1:24:44] Mimsy34: who did Tessa get the money from?
[1:24:55] jimothy64: @mimsy34 Flop
[1:24:55] ApocAFK: Not yet
[1:24:58] ApocAFK: pepeLaugh
[1:25:34] OrestesTheSloth: Oh Flop? Suddenly I feel much better about it
[1:25:57] retrowolf0498: They don't deserve Flop's money.
[1:26:02] dinoroaria: Fl OMEGALUL p
[1:26:33] JoeayIV: the group offers never stop
[1:26:47] jimothy64: Wait.. if she ends up getting the house anyways with somebody else, that would be the absolute best ending.
[1:26:58] JoeayIV: mega flex
[1:27:07] leydann: I think she'll need a bit more than 50k
[1:27:35] JoeayIV: oh man
[1:27:35] QuesoCommander: need to invent Tessa stocks so that different groups can purchase shares
[1:27:36] ApocAFK: Hmmm
[1:27:38] MinnRia: nakkiSip
[1:27:39] jimothy64: Then she can sit on her porch and watch their inevitable raid after somebody leaves weed and guns in a car out front
[1:27:39] JoeayIV: thats a fucking group
[1:27:42] dinoroaria: curvyeHmm
[1:27:48] retrowolf0498: This group just got really interesting and way more organized.
[1:27:51] ApocAFK: Friends in all directions
[1:27:55] Jen848: nakkiSip nakkiPopcorn
[1:28:01] CrisKross99: wow
[1:28:20] ApocAFK: Man, Jay is GOOD at poaching, even if Tessa says no
[1:28:20] niwicky: who is he talking about?
[1:28:32] jimothy64: Michael and Jenny is a pairing.. and maybe more Tessa's speed of "cautious but still occasionally crackhead"
[1:28:35] ApocAFK: This is all the things that Tessa had issues with pepeLaugh
[1:29:03] vipersummer: this was not on my bingo card.... but working with Micharl and Jenny thats interesting
[1:29:34] Jen848: this could be interesting
[1:29:36] KaiFulci: thats so funny
[1:29:57] jimothy64: Oh my god this would be too perfect
[1:30:22] niwicky: the chanclas
[1:31:00] JoeayIV: time to stand in the back with a knife out
[1:31:04] retrowolf0498: This new group sounds perfect.
[1:31:35] JRubes13: if everyone is in, it has a lot of potential
[1:31:55] MinnRia: nakkiHm
[1:31:55] Rekonin: Hmm, living with the biggest criminal enabler of old LS, Jenny Hall
[1:31:55] jimothy64: Tessa just stumbles into opportunities its.. beautiful
[1:31:57] JoeayIV: you know
[1:31:58] ApocAFK: True
[1:32:00] leydann: it seems a bit premature to jump from one group to another,
[1:32:03] JoeayIV: thats kinda a good thing for Tessa no?
[1:32:06] KaiFulci: oh crap yea
[1:32:09] leydann: although it does seem promising
[1:32:11] KaiFulci: didnt think about that
[1:32:13] JoeayIV: less a chance of conflict to show up
[1:32:21] JoeayIV: Tessa and Jay NA
[1:32:26] kettchup: just fix your schedule 4Head
[1:32:28] ApocAFK: I mean, you miss out on a bunch of the benefits ye
[1:32:31] MinnRia: I am excited to see what you end up choosing for Tessa
[1:32:36] jimothy64: That might be better, no? It's a looser thing, backing without too much chaining in..
[1:32:46] JoeayIV: for Tessa specifically it kinda works
[1:32:46] ApocAFK: I can't imagine Nakki streaming Tobii hours
[1:32:56] retrowolf0498: Sometimes having the group spread out among time zones is good. Bring in new people and have someone watching 24/7
[1:32:57] JoeayIV: cuz it lets her float
[1:33:01] JoeayIV: she doesn't have to worry
[1:33:15] dinoroaria: nakkiAww nakkiJeez nakkiMan nakkiLis
[1:33:18] ApocAFK: The mob pepeLaugh
[1:33:26] kelpklepto: have convos with the other people, like jenny first?
[1:33:28] silverarrows47: Tessa yeeJay can't imagine what it took to come to this point.
[1:33:43] jimothy64: Basically makes her a free agent with actual powerful backing if somehow needed
[1:33:45] Jen848: Man, today is spicy!
[1:33:48] silverarrows47: hopefully she finds out in RP
[1:34:01] CrisKross99: true
[1:34:24] jimothy64: Like, how does tessa stumble into what *sounds* like the perfect offer? Obviously merits further thought but that's kind of hilarious
[1:34:29] QuesoCommander: got more time for networking outside of the group
[1:34:33] KaiFulci: what about the clowns lol
[1:34:50] JoeayIV: the clowns bumble into conflict
[1:34:51] JoeayIV: often
[1:34:51] Mimsy34: they dictate who you can be friends with it seems
[1:34:54] ApocAFK: I feel like she can pull that off with groups like Jay's, she can be a close friend without being directly affiliated, misses out on SOME of the benefits by settling with a group
[1:34:57] owlicus: local reporting us for illegal parking nakkiHands
[1:35:01] ApocAFK: Just be friends, and keep options open
[1:35:19] JoeayIV: the thing about this offer is its less support than with a large present group
[1:35:22] Mimsy34: it could be Friends with Benefits....without any nookie
[1:35:23] QuesoCommander: maybe not a friend to all, but a friend to a few (gangs)
[1:35:24] JoeayIV: but more support than being alone
[1:35:40] dinoroaria: nakkiWaddleKnife I have a knife!
[1:35:44] ChaosKnight0777: what do you think juno reaction will be?
[1:35:55] owlicus: uhh

[1:35:58] ApocAFK: uhhh
[1:36:08] ZigSithExarKun: uh
[1:36:08] owlicus: that was not what i was expecting
[1:36:17] KaiFulci: what just happened
[1:36:30] retrowolf0498: That was pure sbs
[1:36:43] retrowolf0498: And there's the chaos
[1:37:03] jimothy64: Wonder how Jay gets along with Lottie.. while obviously Lottie isn't tied to Tessa but..

[1:46:43] ApocAFK: nakkiKEKS He puts it so bluntly, but he gets it
[1:47:16] ApocAFK: Tessa getting a free 2k+ for going on a ridealong with Jay is cool
[1:47:46] QuesoCommander: getting paid for some therapy sechs
[1:47:54] ApocAFK: Hmmm
[1:48:05] silverarrows47: awwww
[1:49:41] dinoroaria: Did you know? Now you know!
[1:50:09] jimothy64: Wonder if Lottie would be interested too.. Michael might be good for some of her aspirations, and it might be more her timezone too
[1:50:13] 80sHairMetalFan: nakkiS
[1:50:17] Jen848: lol

[1:51:56] JoeayIV: mid Grime
[1:51:56] OrestesTheSloth: Jay is good people
[1:52:03] jimothy64: Definitely feel like the least strings attached to an offer.. and one that potentially doesn't close the other doors as much as the other offers might
[1:52:03] ApocAFK: Such a different vibe from Ka Chao
[1:52:05] vipersummer: ok time to get blooded out and then burn the Italians to the grown after
[1:52:24] DruminDriver: What's Tessa's goals for 4.0 does she plan to do crime?

[2:01:53] Chiracho: yeah the house seems to have been the catalyst to it all
[2:01:59] jimothy64: Straw that broke the camels back on a respect front, too.
[2:02:02] dinoroaria: sitt just sitting there (menacingly)
[2:02:28] SalemZev: We love tiny tony...
[2:03:01] jimothy64: But yeah.. the whole "two weeks to leave" was never a thing from Tessa's pov. It was two weeks for Vito to prove himself, that's all Tessa was told..
[2:03:18] OrestesTheSloth: Seems like just yesterday Tony was teaching Tessa how to grow weed
[2:03:25] Brumorin: most of them seem like decent people. just not the vibe at the moment.
[2:03:29] Rekonin: Tony chasing after Tessa yesterday spoke volumes
[2:04:17] jimothy64: Most of them are solid, but leadership is too wishy-washy and Carlo is a write off at this point..
[2:04:21] vipersummer: i mean it is a two way street but they didnt really make much of an effort either.... Fifi a little

[2:45:53] neeveli: tbf even with the loan they were missing 65k to buy the house tessa wanted
[2:46:37] Chiracho: @neeveli eve put in another 50k aswell so they were only 15k away from the house tessa wanted
[2:47:25] PsyccoToxicc: yeah and they said you could grind that in 2hrs if i remember correctly
[2:47:51] neeveli: @chiracho yes but eve herself said she preferred getting the cheaper house at the end. Not saying their decision made sense though
[2:48:03] JoeayIV: within minutes she had 50k
[2:48:07] JoeayIV: ezpz

[2:54:16] michjl90: vito placed her in that position tho
[2:54:32] michjl90: so no respect for vito‚Äôs decision on it?
[2:54:48] jimothy64: The fact Eve managed to get herself some weird leadership position in the circumstances she did, never sat right with me.. it was the first and biggest red flag of Vito's leadership
[2:54:56] distractfulilly: Tessa becomes a "life coach", starts her own group, takes over the city

[3:04:36] StreamElements: Feel free to join my Discord flock, 5000 members and growing! https://discordapp.com/invite/nakkida
[3:04:51] jimothy64: The Family right now isn't really anything. It's less organised than even the most scuffed southside gangs.. at best they're a group of friends who try to dabble in crime together.. but even that's charitable sometimes. @btc718
[3:06:55] jimothy64: Woah.. thats a big step for Juno.. realising doing things just for Vito might be an issue
[3:06:56] JoeayIV: oop
[3:07:01] btc718: it‚Äôs just the fact that they use the words ‚Äò for the family‚Äô feels very manipulative

[6:48:06] JoeayIV: there was a buffer a little while ago
[6:48:08] Darth_hedgehog: @Nakkida do we have any duck commissions?
[6:48:14] JoeayIV: but it was like for 20 seconds
[6:48:17] kelpklepto: Snr Buns causes headaches in more ways than one.
[6:48:19] Jen848: Daily trip to the hospital. Just normal things
[6:48:22] JoeayIV: like 2 mins ago
[6:48:28] nobodybodon: just before you left snr buns
[6:48:43] nobodybodon: left the subway entrance*
[6:48:49] happy_questionmark: i only counted 683 dropped frames
[6:49:10] Steven_b: @nobodybodon Subway eat fresh! nakkiSmile
[6:49:12] jimothy64: @talon76767 tessa left the italians officially, Juno spiralled into an actually positive realisation, clown court was clown court
[6:49:22] retrowolf0498: Someone was having fun
[6:49:23] JoeayIV: i honestly think Lottie has -1000 speech
[6:49:29] bioblade: Oh no, what happened to Tesso
[6:49:33] JoeayIV: and thats the whole thing
[6:49:45] ramita__x: I missed what happened to Lottie
[6:50:14] MinnRia: Tessa was in a car accident, broken ribs
[6:50:16] talon76767: @jimothy64 explains nothing since i never watch streams in order or from start to finish but thanks for trying
[6:50:21] nobodybodon: From what donnie said the conversation seems to have gone "you didn't do this/you did do this, so I'm out"
[6:50:23] Steven_b: frick sounds like ive missed alot being at work guess ima dive into the vod
[6:50:31] retrowolf0498: Almost just got another broken leg
[6:50:53] jimothy64: At the end of the day, keeping criminals calm is Tessa's forte.. even before it was her job
[6:51:36] Maverick2813: yesterday‚Äôs jaywalking conversation almost came back and bite you ü§£
[6:51:37] retrowolf0498: Burning bridges
[6:51:53] happy_questionmark: did they get the baby poop house?

[6:52:18] Jen848: @happy_questionmark yep

[6:52:31] talon76767: apparently ghosts want to break her legs now as well
[6:52:42] happy_questionmark: thanks Jen848
[6:52:47] Brumorin: yeah they weren't really that kind
[6:52:52] Jen848: yw nakkiFlower
[6:53:11] zacho1900: What happen with the house thing?
[6:53:13] TheJRoller: Tessa is the one people answer too. She is used to being in charge. she doesnt fit as a peon
[6:53:15] niteflyeruzi: @Auronblade60 Maybe it was driven by a 5-yr old that had to choose between seeing over the dash and working the pedals :)
[6:53:41] kelpklepto: wait why does juno hate lottie
[6:53:44] jimothy64: At the same time, Lottie wouldn't talk to Tessa when she asked about the clown stabbing.. so it's at least partially self-induced probably a solid 75/25 split
[6:54:00] CrisKross99: yea! I have no idea what the lore is there but Juno really doesn‚Äôt like Lottie
[6:54:42] talon76767: i know no lore since ive never seen many of these streams
[6:54:50] nobodybodon: I think the real problem is she stole that bicycle that month
[6:54:56] nobodybodon: that was way too hardcore for the italians
[6:55:05] nobodybodon: last month*
[6:55:51] retrowolf0498: Randomly got a papercut on my little finger from a popcorn box
[6:56:04] jimothy64: Tessa is decent at communicating, but its literally always on her to chase people to talk about her issues.. nobody ever stops and checks on Tessa really.
[6:56:34] daZonk: I wish I wasn‚Äôt flawed in my own way
[6:56:41] retrowolf0498: Tiny was the only one who stopped to see if Tessa needed something earlier
[6:56:50] jimothy64: Lottie doesn't seek people out to a similar degree, but she also doesn't open up when people enquire directly
[6:56:59] talon76767: if i did gta rp id just be a therapist, thats it,  cause clearly people need one and there isnt
[6:57:02] whodoneit8: here from K's stream, big fan of tessa
[6:57:04] retrowolf0498: That's a big part of the issue. They overlooked Tessa a lot
[6:57:12] happy_questionmark: pet store?
[6:57:14] kelpklepto: oh God, Tessa and the guild
[6:57:15] sage40k: POOP DISTRICT HYPE

[6:57:43] JoeayIV: poach Juno from Vito for the mega stir
[6:57:47] retrowolf0498: I think Jay's offer is a good thing. Sounds like you'll have freedom but with people having your back at the same time. Everyone doing their own thing
[6:57:49] zacho1900: nakkiVERYNOTFINE
[6:58:06] daZonk: Tessa being landlord manager to all Ks tenants would be funny
[6:58:28] jimothy64: I kinda like the vibe of the group offer as almost like.. a baseline? It doesn't seem like it would close doors or throttle her, its just a roommate agreement with a former terrorist lol
[6:58:36] bigclowntiger: Jay's group will be a new group, in which I think Tessa's potential can shine
[6:58:45] TheJRoller: the Italians couldnt see the value of the asset
[6:59:18] JoeayIV: oh heyyyyy Canter
[6:59:22] MajorPorky: I legit thought that plant was Turgle from a distance
[6:59:23] zacho1900: Uuu that sounds like a good idea

[8:16:16] jimothy64: I think the loosely aligned Michael group has the most promise... but it absolutely needs feeling out. It seems like it'd be the least strangling
[8:16:33] TinIsARobot: Would be kind of cool for Tessa to just be the neutral 3rd party for other groups, be able to settle disputes and whatnot between them (Judge but not part of the "Legal" system)
[8:16:38] Con4you: o

[8:21:09] jimothy64: And it all came to a head when they tried to use her as an ATM
[8:21:20] zwelleriox: Didn't know that things were like that between her and Vito
[8:22:00] cosmicora: random question -> is Tessa gonna be the mediator/chaperone for the gigi x chatty x ray mond date? angelkzClown
[8:22:52] jimothy64: They don't learn. The fact that even after the Tony van impound situation, and the academy, they still didn't see the importance of legal parking
[8:22:52] IosefSerov: Did she wind up getting back the 16k too or just give up on that?
[8:23:00] nobodybodon: you still owe Gigi a hangout day, family or no

[8:26:22] retrowolf0498: I fully expect that house to get raided and it'll either be Carlo or Vito who causes it.

[8:26:39] WorldPeacElbow: thanks for the recap
[8:26:43] IosefSerov: Junos reaction what happened
[8:26:51] jimothy64: Did not expect "Juno finally comes to a positive realisation about her own worth" as a possible ripple effect
[8:26:51] nobodybodon: nakkiCopium he was paying attention
[8:27:07] retrowolf0498: @nobodybodon That he has. The rest of them need to park NORMALLY
[8:27:09] jimothy64: @retrowolf0498 nah, Tony's van lol
[8:27:22] retrowolf0498: @jimothy64 He learned after his first impound scare
[8:27:54] jimothy64: I mean... he still didn't object to the no parking at the house.. @retrowolf0498
[8:28:13] retrowolf0498: @jimothy64 He did bring it up as an issue and agreed with Tessa
