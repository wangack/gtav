[8:30:50] Splashzone69: @XxRE4P3RxX yeah absolutely
[8:30:52] GrossaChu: Lurking all night, but gotta say, this is A+ RP right here!! Welcome back Officer!
[8:31:05] Legionofsalt: @Matt_Kitten YES
[8:31:10] THEKrundle: It's always great when crims start arguing LEO SOP's, lol
[8:31:26] Legionofsalt: That era of RP was GOATED
[8:31:28] DawkHoliday: Hey, how about you just dont break the law where we gotta chase you :)
[8:31:40] THEKrundle: RP'ers are auditors on crack
[8:31:40] Matt_Kitten: @Legionofsalt IIRC he took 3 LEOs with him the night they finally killed him
[8:31:50] CaughtAFaygo: @Legionofsalt 100%
[8:32:06] jenntacles: Can people die in RP like this? Do their characters come back or are they permadead?
[8:32:16] DawkHoliday: @jenntacles they choose when to die
[8:32:21] AmeKeru: @jenntacles It's usually up to the player.
[8:32:27] XxRE4P3RxX: its not the collision that always kills you, its the sudden stop at the end NODDERS
[8:32:28] Kappadonna123: they can come back but i think there memory is erased
[8:32:29] QBDLettuce: NOTED
[8:32:29] Trip_x1: @jenntacles It's the person's choice
[8:32:30] Matt_Kitten: @jenntacles either one is an option. kind of up to the player and the injuries involved
[8:32:34] Splashzone69: @jenntacles they're supposed to but the quality of RP varies from what little I've seen
[8:32:38] DawkHoliday: @jenntacles So USUALLY, it's when it's a good moment. Someone has you and monologues and has you or you just feel the moment is right
[8:33:00] jenntacles: Ah gotcha
[8:33:02] its_the_sims: Just depends on the quality of the RP
[8:33:16] DawkHoliday: ^
[8:33:20] THEKrundle: @Splashzone69 The bar has lowered tremendously over the years
[8:33:24] Splashzone69: sheriffNOTES building missile bad
[8:33:27] QBDLettuce: peepoEli
[8:33:27] Legionofsalt: Perma is a choice but ppl can die and notr remember or if they take an instant respawn then they have to forget the days events
[8:33:39] Matt_Kitten: @Matt_Kitten for instance, some characters have cartoon levels of resilience where they bounce back after three days of being shot to pieces, whereas Baada Ka (the guy I was talking about a little bit ago) was shot to pieces, blown up with his own C4, and I think hit by every law enforcement vehicle in the state, and died on scene
[8:33:47] dragon_lord201: Hey what's up
[8:33:49] Splashzone69: @THEKrundle damn, wish I caught the old days then
[8:33:50] NightingaleEcho: I've been watching WildRP a lot lately which is a Red Dead Redemption 2 RP server, a lot of those folks do a D20 dice roll when their character is downed.
[8:33:56] DawkHoliday: I know someone who rolls a D20 @jenntacles and the more often they role the harder it is to live
[8:34:03] QBDLettuce: sheriffNOTES Do not throw red shells at cars behind
[8:34:18] THEKrundle: @Splashzone69 The quality of RP you'll see from Eli harkens from the golden era of RP
[8:34:30] Matt_Kitten: @Matt_Kitten a lot of RPers will keep a d20 nearby and roll death saves to see if their character has died, depending on the wounds they see on their character
[8:34:41] THEKrundle: He's already showing there's more to RP than "cops & roobers"
[8:34:42] Hizack: okay chat I gotta go to bed. peepoBye
[8:34:48] VakMarcoe: this roleplay is bringing back so many memories of the golden age of rp
[8:34:50] Splashzone69: This doesn't even seem like RP from Eli. It's just him, which is awesome
[8:34:54] His_Royal_Hairiness: Rest well Hizack

[8:35:52] NightingaleEcho: @jenntacles the old style light on a patrol car was a single light and was often refered to as a "bubble gum machine"
[8:35:59] Splashzone69: @Kappadonna123 yeah this
[8:35:59] Legionofsalt: MAn this was a Wild server and then Summit and Chang Gang brought actual RP to the Server and Now ELI is bring the LOng arm of the LAw to the Community
