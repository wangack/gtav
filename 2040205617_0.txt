[2:27:57] NobodyEpic4321: So hitting 100 down the highway? LUL
[2:27:58] maikyy96: dropping off in paleto and having to go back docs does make it 10 min longer
[2:28:07] cdognozza: Imma say 2.8

[2:28:18] roba1705: 2k LUL
[2:28:33] mokoto05: prayge for a good payout
[2:28:34] maikyy96: 6?

[2:28:57] tobias0__: 2.8
[2:28:59] maikyy96: somewhere between 2.4k and 3k
[2:29:10] stnash52: I’m guessing if you accept all the low weight contracts it’s like 3.5 full run
[2:29:24] rome696: It's not guaranteed 500 on each tho
[2:29:41] NonStopGam3r: Can definitely earn like 5k if you get jobs with less packages tho
[2:29:43] maikyy96: yeah i reckon u get less then 3k
