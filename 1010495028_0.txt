[7:13:30] Luthercorpz: Roll wit dem HotBoiz pentawBlock
[7:13:35] TrigginFypo: @clientnotfound he couldve relayed what the driver said earlier
[7:13:41] Jardon_follower: When you weren't constantly calling roads and directions as primary, was it because you wanted to clear radio traffic when the shooting started?
[7:13:44] boomcat8901: the biggest issue with the PD rn seems to be that if someone is the highest rank on scene they need to make it clear they are taking control, or clearly deligate it right away. This is all super interesting, PD has been growing and changing so rapidly, all good content.
[7:13:55] graydaemon: ^^^^
[7:13:58] 0xygenhomie: he said on radio the driver still had a hostage
[7:14:27] cjc_95: @TrigginFypo he did it as it was happening, idk about that
[7:14:28] jadetortoise: I hope PD sorts out the command issue.
[7:14:32] graydaemon: It wasn't even clear that HC was involved. So that made things even more confusing.
