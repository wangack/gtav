[2:08:58] Chipset3: MORE EVIL RUTH
[2:08:59] PeterPleb1992: at the end of ruths suspension, they should hold a 5 person review and fire her and offer her a chance to come to the next academy KEKW
[2:08:59] DinosaurUnderwear: It's made for some of the best RP on the server so far
[2:09:00] MrG00dKat: Ruth Joker arc
[2:09:00] heavyd834: but I dont think cheever actually thinks theres anything wrong with ruth ooc

[2:09:29] CreepeAir: ruth never seems to admit she did something wrong
[2:09:29] knowlightnofear: I'm curious if anyone has talked to Cheever OOC and see how's she's doing. I feel like it'd be hard to not take some of the stuff personally
[2:09:29] pax_rush: why is cornwood the only char on the server with that body type?
[2:09:30] BraerHZ: I actually think the Ruth stuff isn't Ruth's fault, but Slacks and Turner's. She was RP'ing her angle but not supplemented by Slacks and Turner enough.
[2:09:31] MrG00dKat: Derolo becomes her Harleequin
[2:09:31] HashtagSoBlessed: Imagine Ruth in a senior buns outfit ICANT
[2:09:33] StreamElements: Watch my latest video: Cornwood FIGHTS For His Job - https://youtube.com/watch?v=Q39BTw6T6Hg
[2:09:34] flugel_binder: I would say every char spins out of control
[2:09:37] justgothere_andimstoned: internal affairs
[2:09:37] P4K_Little: chaotic good ruth who perceives cornwood as a threat to the city determined to take him out / down would be awesome to watch
[2:09:38] TimmayHS: Cheever has said on stream she does not care about content at all @EsfandTV
[2:09:41] jd2881: The problem is I think a majority in the PD are fine with Ruth. Atleast from the audits I've seen that seems to be the case.
[2:09:42] PacGamer: @Lupusdeus Need a clip
[2:09:43] Sadisticmedic: No Should be a Cadet
[2:09:46] Dominikun: Ruth becomes her own enemy by creating her own department
[2:09:46] Joongi_: @lupusdeus pepeW
[2:09:46] visvisony: YEP
[2:09:48] StormiNyan: cheever in herself is amazing ! crumpHeart

[2:09:53] itsalviiin: YEP
[2:09:53] drtGUSH: But in her eyes she is not spiring out of control
[2:09:56] TimmayHS: Ruth should run the prison
[2:09:56] visvisony: YEP her rp is great
[2:09:58] kryles: @EsfandTV could she just raid one of the gangs hideouts naked and yelling obscenities' and then claim insanity
[2:09:59] TheGodmother: esfandL esfandL esfandL
[2:09:59] HavocusRex: idk that she believes she's playing the villain, is there proof of that?

[2:10:11] Joongi_: I find hilarious how you can hear her kid sometimes when she talks LULW
[2:10:11] TakeAChance: She said something like "if the content is above the RP, you're playing it wrong" lol
[2:10:12] bleiddyeah: LULW WHAT
[2:10:12] Geralt_De_Rivia: Oh
[2:10:13] twilightbaseballscene: i think that‚Äôs out of context lol

[2:10:14] im_Nando: oh Sadeg
[2:10:14] ChocolateMassage: LOLW
[2:10:15] CreepeAir: @TimmayHS she said you shouldnt take content into consideration in pd decisions. she didnt say she doesnt care about content altogether KEKW
[2:10:16] Pheyerus: That‚Äôs not gonna make her stream anymore than she already doesn‚Äôt
[2:10:17] Cela_8: she didnt say that with that context
[2:10:19] schwaggy83: what‚Äôs Ruth‚Äôs twitch account @esfandtv ?
[2:10:19] HanzOntush: I'm picturing Janice from the Office for some reason.

[2:10:25] justgothere_andimstoned: ruth clown arc Pause
[2:10:28] Geralt_De_Rivia: Oh lol
[2:10:28] claptil: Serious rp is fine, but making a PD fully serious seems meh
[2:10:29] NeonyClassic: @EsfandTV  Hi, Yesterday you said the FFVII rebirth would happen after wedding and understandably that could not happen so late but today not either ? PoroSad
[2:10:29] iNF3RNO_ZA: writing everyones report is administrative YEP
[2:10:30] Trigonda: She cares about the RP over the content
[2:10:30] HebrewOutlaw: @takeachance L take
[2:10:31] Allsayan: i mean if she wants the PD to be super serious then why does she not hold herself to the same standard of the other cops lul
[2:10:32] PsychoJoker: She said on her stream before that her Ruth character is power hungry that should say it all chat
[2:10:32] StormiNyan: ruth clown ICANT
[2:10:33] BraerHZ: I think Ruby's take has been the most honest one yet - No vision aside from "We want this to be serious"
[2:10:33] Cela_8: your chat is kind out of control on social media when it comes to ruth
[2:10:34] TheGodmother: Joongi_ yeah kekw
[2:10:34] Yupieo: obs meant here own contentpr
[2:10:34] undreadful_riggz: undreadful_riggz subscribed with Prime. 
[2:10:35] T0pher_C: @jtm0516 how so
[2:10:35] Sanivay: Her nickname should be rent free ruth
[2:10:37] CandyMaster: she should just go crim
[2:10:37] Mastodonian: It's a content server GETALIFE
[2:10:40] Sulm: If that's true, she really has no business being in that much control over something so critical on the server
[2:10:41] undreadful_riggz: Ayy ohhh
[2:10:41] flugel_binder: if we have know one to challenge us it gets boring
[2:10:42] SwaggWaggon: bro stunned the cop viewers with that take
[2:10:43] Lupusdeus: Yeah she definitely has a different approach to RP
[2:10:44] jeffrey778: yeah it be super interesting to see what direction the spiral goes
[2:10:45] SacraficialYoshi: @schwaggy83 cheever7 i think
[2:10:45] Kirbyeatsplanets: the city needs a badguy. Ruth is a good badguy. If she wasn't the badguy, who would it be? the mayor?
[2:10:45] infintitedream: what I am hearing and I agree with is she should have fun with the spiraling.
[2:10:47] dadsyuk: if she doesnt see anything wrong with her character i think the person herself is delusional
[2:10:47] Gachiguru: she doesnt stream because her kids are committing murder in the background 24/7 LULE
[2:10:50] knox__overstreet: Ehh, sounds like damage control
[2:10:50] TakeAChance: @HebrewOutlaw Agreed. Especially on a content server..
[2:10:52] wishes323: ppl who cant stream very often at all should prob not take positions that require a largepresence on the server
[2:10:54] C0rrupted332: @Sulm gatekeeping
[2:10:54] MackPlays: Ruth and Cornwood both just need to be more subtle about their propoganda
[2:10:55] littleterp: esfand looking really cute today! can you tell Cyr to call my mom back
[2:10:56] chudbungus: @Gachiguru OHMEGALUL

[2:10:56] StreamElements: @WintersWolfcry, $3 for custom TTS or $1 for default Brian voice. Check the TTS guide: https://tts.monster/esfandtv
[2:10:58] MrMingy: I know this might now be a popular opinion but you if have a lot of outside responsibilities/ can‚Äôt be flexible with your time you shouldn‚Äôt really go for a leadership position in game
[2:11:00] SurelyBaked: ruth literally said her being accused of treason didn‚Äôt matter essentially bc she said so, she lost xdd
[2:11:01] Yupieo: i think she said it about here content
[2:11:04] bangsssss: its all RP
[2:11:07] devlin0221: @esfandtv Cheevers told me that she hates Cornwood IRL and wants to see your stream die.
[2:11:12] zorahul: She said this sever shouldnt take into account content when discussing police work
[2:11:13] schwaggy83: who is Ruth on twitch ?
[2:11:13] Allsayan: like at this point she needs a fresh cop or something because ruth has done too much shady shit
[2:11:13] TheLadyCupcake: HDMI
[2:11:14] MrMingy: just play a regular officer
[2:11:15] bleiddyeah: @esfandtv have you watched your first vods with cornwood it‚Äôs hilarious
[2:11:17] SacraficialYoshi: she made a lot of enemies 4Shrug popular ones as well
[2:11:17] TheBull14597: probably what happened was the admins set the objective to make this pd more serious and theyre just seeing that through
[2:11:19] Gachiguru: Its a god damn mcdonalds playplace at her house
[2:11:20] SoLDiER510: Hell no the point was getting her out of the PD HahaReindeer
[2:11:21] Milo_lul: @EsfandTV Jenny Hall accidently told her today Cornwood wasnt fired, because noone else told her OMEGALAUGHING
[2:11:22] bennnnboy49: @devlin0221 ReallyMad
[2:11:23] yatesy118: has she rp‚Äôed outside pd since suspension? if she hasn‚Äôt that speaks volumes
[2:11:23] Chrisaroo_: She chose to play it that way tho. She forced RP on people and didnt come around to RP it out
[2:11:24] Gachiguru: AAAA BabyRage
[2:11:24] Zarniwooper: What happened, is Ruth gone gone?
[2:11:25] KnowMadss: tow ruths car :)
[2:11:25] PappaMidNight: Theres no way she gets fired for treason

[2:11:37] YEP46: YEP ruth back to the city, then joining lang buddha's group
[2:11:38] WastelanderB: you make Cheever laugh all the time...just not Ruth lol ... rp
[2:11:40] SereneDreams: @MrMingy 100%, I am a caregiver IRL and have difficulties even having a D&D campaign because I have responsibilities and am basically working 24/7
[2:11:41] UA_Shark: clip?
[2:11:42] crescenterra: it would be pretty fun if Max decides to fire her after the audit
[2:11:43] Edward_Theodore: finish the damn report ma corn
[2:11:43] donbena_: I think Osvaldo Pingafria should be Chief of Police tbh NODDERS
[2:11:44] chunkychedders: Ruth should just perma her character to the hands of cornwood
[2:11:46] bb_woo: They got to over controlling it's killing the off the wall rpüëçüòé
[2:11:48] JustSomeAsianGuyWithADog: Cheer300 I've got an idea for ruth's character arc. Hear me out. Los Santos Taliban
[2:11:49] cheetobbob: @devlin0221 thought you were memeing but you sub long time. she really say that?
[2:11:50] iNF3RNO_ZA: She was spiderman with no responsibilities
[2:11:51] destinygun: Did you finish the report?
[2:11:54] fos2u2: fos2u2 subscribed with Prime. 
[2:11:54] TakeAChance: Cheever literally said "I hope Cornwood gets his head chopped off and Esfand goes into a coma"
[2:11:54] spazticbull: @outkast2 Xavier is one of the degens
[2:11:56] JO3Y_C: Ruth's problem isnt the Treason Charge.. It's going to be the felony charge of destroying evidence AKA the initial announcement she made on the treason matter.
[2:11:57] Mastodonian: @zorahul Holy bad take Ruth WeirdDude
[2:11:58] LordBoogieBlue: old cornwodo vods?
[2:11:58] Raisha_Delos: @yatesy118 100%
[2:11:59] driver1036: Where is your partner today
[2:11:59] ItsLucuss: @EsfandTV is there anywhere we can watch the 3.0 VODs?
[2:11:59] BraerHZ: I actually want Duncan to be commish
[2:12:01] devlin0221: @cheetobbob No hahah Im playing
[2:12:01] anyprimersboys: The content with ruth is now to see the way the character adapts to the new system and more open PD
[2:12:04] bleiddyeah: @esfandtv yeah your vods are on YouTube all of them with cornwood
[2:12:04] chudbungus: Ruth was never a good character for the PD. It's as simple as that.
[2:12:05] Pheyerus: she plays like 4 hours a week max she shouldnt have any big role on the server
[2:12:05] FunkBish: Ch**ver ReallyMad
[2:12:07] flugel_binder: its been great rp keep challenging people SeemsGood
[2:12:08] drippingswag315: would you ever want a non PD character or nah

[2:12:13] Jeremyohno: I hope she finds another character to come back on or something.
[2:12:14] sammelweis: @TakeAChance goddamn
[2:12:15] Edward_Theodore: lol
[2:12:16] WineNot: @EsfandTV are you going to speak to the rest of the auditors
[2:12:16] Felrane: I still laugh thinking about how you just capped that guy doing his job thinking he was a local in 3.0. Also when you knocked the guy out in the cell
[2:12:16] CreepeAir: i love watching her streams. i wish she streams more but i understand why she might not
[2:12:18] devlin0221: @cheetobbob Sorry lol
[2:12:19] Sadisticmedic: @Zarniwooper She suspended herself pending charger from the Mayor . Which is weird
[2:12:19] StormiNyan: @chudbungus BASED
[2:12:26] SurelyBaked: I‚Äôll never forget watching cornwood run up to police scenes and spying on Andrew‚Äôs from a bush xdd the good ol days @esfandTV
[2:12:26] boGrral: esfandVIBE esfandVIBE esfandVIBE
[2:12:27] chewymorsel: cheever should make ruth, the director of internal affairs
[2:12:28] KMGP_Outlaw: lol
[2:12:28] Kaseyfullofjoy: you ar<3
[2:12:28] skiddykitty3: you need to be to build the city tho
[2:12:29] boGrral: esfandCOPS esfandCOPS esfandCOPS
[2:12:30] LordBoogieBlue: lol
[2:12:30] destinygun: @EsfandTV reset ui?
[2:12:31] Xypha: can i ask what you use for the face filters?
[2:12:31] JO3Y_C: DEGEN YEP
[2:12:32] puddypounce: she plays way more than that it's just early in themorning
[2:12:32] Tinkerton: TwitchUnity @EsfandTV
[2:12:32] charybdes: She literally said on her stream, when you shot DT the 3rd, that it was hilarious but Ruth is gonna hate it.
[2:12:33] Mastodonian: Someone's who's not there enough should not have this much impact though
[2:12:34] widbar: @TakeAChance damn. Ruth roleplaying Cheever BASED
[2:12:34] PLK_: esfandVIBE
[2:12:35] SteveAdeptus: This is a content server. She picked the wrong server to try and be a super serious cop. There has to be a balance, it can't be too goofy either.
[2:12:35] Dougi: 30 hours a day YEP
[2:12:37] Kalious78: never forget ruth saved cornwood, ruth cornballs frenn
[2:12:37] twilightbaseballscene: i do kinda agree with that‚Ä¶ the role requires hours
[2:12:37] boGrral: esfandCOPS do u even degen bro?
[2:12:37] Mindhysteria: i think she should just make another cop
[2:12:38] tianivan: CORNWOOD NEED FOOD
[2:12:38] femboysthighs: the KKornwood 15 hour special
[2:12:39] Kelborn: she plays more than that but doesnt stream, however not enough to warrant her character having that much effect on others
[2:12:39] CopperKat: I love that Cornwood's default car is the SUV. Fits him needing a big car. @EsfandTV
[2:12:39] ch3kd: Malton thinks she won't get fired, thought cornwood and Denzel will get fired though
[2:12:41] Gachiguru: but High Command needs to put in a 40 hour work week
[2:12:42] SurelyBaked: big true and real
[2:12:43] NonToxicant: small characters can make huge impacts. like Donald Bush XXIII
[2:12:43] thegummibearmassacre: @Xypha HUH
[2:12:45] MackPlays: When u have authority and responsibility u have to be around
[2:12:45] Felrane: she plays as much as you just on diffrent toons
[2:12:45] KNGRSM: Only way it can be done @EsfandTV
[2:12:46] T0pher_C: @Xypha lmao filters?
[2:12:46] UnfluffyBunny: PD literally drives Content and RP what??
[2:12:47] chudbungus: You have to hold decent hours to be a captain. There's no way to argue around that.
[2:12:48] flugel_binder: Esfand lives in the city Kappa
[2:12:48] lillukeii: @jeremyohno maybe her crim character could become a cop character I don‚Äôt think she has any felony‚Äôs
[2:12:48] Dash_O_Pepper: If you can only play 12-20 hours a week you shouldn't be a captain.
[2:12:50] boGrral: esfandFlick esfandFlick esfandFlick
[2:12:50] Raisha_Delos: 30hours a week isn't a hard ask imo, for leadership
[2:12:54] EPiQ: Also stream =/= Play...and high command =/= equal all in-city.
[2:12:56] crescenterra: if you're gonna be in command position you just have to be able to spare the time, it sounds kinda shitty but I feel like that's fair @EsfandTV
[2:12:57] jwou11: She streams more than people think it's just early morning when less people are watching
[2:12:57] docterstrange_: will you investigate today?
[2:13:00] TheBull14597: cheever is just full on immersion
[2:13:00] SacraficialYoshi: drue
[2:13:00] hangloose2: you and moon have been carrying the server
[2:13:02] slodisgood: I wonder if Ruth would stream Rebirth for us.
[2:13:02] SacraficialYoshi: BASED
[2:13:02] skiddykitty3: at least 5 hours 5 days a week
[2:13:02] gillyp01: Aware
[2:13:02] DannyL3tscher: need to be available for other players for sure, captains role is to be on 8 hours a day during their shift imo
[2:13:03] Amstadam: 100%
[2:13:05] MackPlays: If a real life manager came around a couple hours a week no one would respect them
[2:13:06] zorahul: 100%
[2:13:06] esuardi: Aware
[2:13:07] Percolatorx: like slacks
[2:13:07] humanhere2: I know she doesn't stream much, but think that she is on a lot.... just not in other shifts...
[2:13:08] danbelow: I sometimes wonder if there's a bit of ooc for others playing into it. Like not wanting to push back because she's a mom. The char is incredible. That can't be said enough
[2:13:09] dapyman: She is playing Ruth like a real world cop but Los Santos is like a carnival funhouse. It's impossible to actually work.
[2:13:09] iNF3RNO_ZA: Chat you're an extra
[2:13:09] krom01001: i think the captain role requires a high level of play time
[2:13:09] howyaben: Or at least be able to show up for all of your shifts full time
[2:13:10] skiddykitty3: as much as moon does
[2:13:11] Glennsweden: @esfandtv Call Dean AppaK
[2:13:11] im_ryebo: Beric is a degen
[2:13:11] SurelyBaked: I think if you want to be in an important role on the server you should have implied availability requirement imo
[2:13:15] harperakami: Malton said things worked much better with 2 captains per shit
[2:13:16] Trepko: Svenson was telling Slacks that they're basically bottlenecking the building of the PD
[2:13:18] bb_woo: Yea but is just because they won't promote anyone?ü§î
[2:13:18] zorahul: How else can you get proper context
[2:13:18] UA_Shark: mr k is popping off too
[2:13:20] Africannibal: Not only was she not online enough, she ALSO caused internal conflict with her way of commanding others
[2:13:20] femboysthighs: you cant progress and develop the PD if you arent ever on to see its issues mhm
[2:13:20] Jeremyohno: It's a group effort.
[2:13:21] JO3Y_C: NoLifers are Pog
[2:13:23] flugel_binder: everyone plays a part
[2:13:24] CuIdra: I think during the building phase you really do need no lifers right now.
[2:13:24] TimmayHS: Chatterbox has been carrying it
[2:13:24] siryork1: no, there is alot of good smaller characters that make the server
[2:13:24] Senkareos: Wouldn't make a serious pd the gameplay for officers very "dry"?
[2:13:25] twilightbaseballscene: moon and mr k are carrying the server LUL
[2:13:25] thegummibearmassacre: Moon been playing 2 characters almost full time Pog
[2:13:26] Chrisaroo_: Def not true. So many amazing Crims
[2:13:26] bleiddyeah: @esfandtv you should say YERP like back  in 3.0
[2:13:26] Sadisticmedic: Not everyone is a successful streamer also .
[2:13:28] KNGRSM: This is the way CORNMAN
[2:13:29] Jeremyohno: Cheever has created all this
[2:13:29] Tinkerton: @EsfandTV  can you stand by people who  Degen like you .. did / do .. <3
[2:13:29] SacraficialYoshi: plenty of crim and slice of life characters also carry that you dont see on pd perspectives
[2:13:31] cozyjozey: from a viewer poc it is true
[2:13:31] chmod_R_777: playing a corrupt cop is fine, but not one in a position of power like a Captain
[2:13:32] TCGK_SUBZERO: "my streamer i watch is carrying the server"
[2:13:33] TheBull14597: in terms of story, he has 100%
[2:13:34] Majopa22: Chatterbox is an unsung GOAT
[2:13:35] lord_odin93: @NeonyClassic At this point, it'll happen when it happens. *shrugs* We just need to let him keep enjoying GTARP and wait longer.
[2:13:37] chef_daddie: Mr K
[2:13:38] SlickWillLay: CG makes a HUGE impact
[2:13:39] T0pher_C: @hangloose2 thats not true at all
[2:13:43] StormiNyan: dundee xdd
[2:13:44] joewelch29: @esfandtv she‚Äôs has important meetings while her kids are in the background etc it‚Äôs rough
[2:13:44] Chrisaroo_: Bobby Charles carries the server
[2:13:44] CHEATERS_UNITE: ruth Kappa
[2:13:45] K4shira: only be online a few hours a week is fine, but then you can't be in a leading position
[2:13:45] slomojosh: they haven‚Äôt allowed you to do anything
[2:13:45] touchmsmh: @tcgk_subzero ikr LUL
[2:13:46] darkm0d: Yeah all the work on PD cars is totally nothing

[2:59:30] MadderHatter: @Spired12 the funds should be separate, the people in that area are paying taxes for nothing if they're not
[2:59:31] deathhhstrokee: @xierany that's not the reason why he got fired he got fired for hurting someone on a pit that was said it was OK to do.

[3:03:35] the_main_burt: @Connortation i dont think so LUL
[3:03:36] Wandering_Ranger: @Gachiguru i agree. Will cause too many conflicts and they'll waste time arguing instead of working
[3:03:36] Donkey__Rhubarb: DoJ could start the Marshals Service
[3:03:37] Xierany: @deathhhstrokee None of what Shiesty did got him fired on it's own, so not really relevant. Most bad charges are about knowledge not greed. You can literally get banned from the server trying to "win", so pushing bad charges is punished both by the PD and OOC
[3:03:38] skilleto19: It was Duncan LUL

[3:04:37] leviathan297: Ratge frenn

[3:04:57] panhever: @EsfandTV u gotta present LASO asap before commisioner is decided and Max is gonna end being mayor, cuz it will get harder afterwards
[3:04:58] PohnJaulPones: this guy...
[3:04:59] stratiz_: Poor Denzel has been forgotten
[3:04:59] that_gui_jokr: as hes going 90
[3:05:00] thebogeym4n: Then, it sounds like it's time to start collecting money to open the Sheriff's Office xdd
[3:05:02] Espartemos: How much of that conversation did Cornwood believe?
[3:05:03] medvedek07: DinoDance
[3:05:06] TimmayHS: the thing is, death isn't death in RP, so it's kinda fine
[3:05:09] MattadinGaming: PD isn't about catching crims. its office RP
[3:05:12] Wandering_Ranger: should only be punished if your RP negatively affects someone
[3:05:14] Felrane: @stratiz_ 5 mins guys. 5 mins lul
[3:05:15] SmugPls: 1m cost but 40m budget xd xd xd
[3:05:17] PlutoniumOC: They are milking the BCSO RP
[3:05:18] Freddiepines: @stratiz_ call you back in 5 minutes pepeLaugh
[3:05:18] Metalcalfe: @EsfandTV I think they're rping delaying the opening so you can finish your ppo. :)

[3:05:19] YegaPega: no repercussion they literally go to prison LULW
[3:05:20] docterstrange_: maybe just talking to deputy mayor to get numbers for the budget will be possible right? @esfandtv
[3:05:20] tyler__96: If cornwood doesn't open the sheriffs office no one will get it open
[3:05:20] visidious_moz: Mr K's free reign of terror is kind of meh tbh
[3:05:24] widbar: BASED
[3:05:25] Faylez: @panhever mhm

[3:05:38] Bright_san: the north is getting spooky, need to show force
[3:05:39] enfranchise_: I think Ruby is the clear choice for comissioner tbh
[3:05:40] ArkVulcan: PD will regress under Commissioner Aldo.
[3:05:42] MoohamedAlii: Its so easy for crims to get away pd needs to do something
[3:05:42] thxperiment: additional departments is mayor not commisioner
[3:05:43] DatDudeJakeC: your talk with ruby last night was awesome

[3:05:48] medvedek07: PrideLaugh
[3:05:49] MahanGM: xdd
[3:05:53] imSteffin: The job of Cornwood being the sole person that is pushing LASO is now completely a pipe dream. Theres way too many people that want it now.
[3:05:53] Majopa22: xdd

[3:06:01] Clodhoppr: giving it back to Aziz soon?
[3:06:03] Doqx42: Commissioner Beric / Chief Ruby / Sheriff Cornwood
[3:06:03] deathhhstrokee: @xierany I never sad bad charges the cops literally determine if they think the law applies and crims have to go to court to prove them wrong. If you put money as a bonus greed will always come out on top.

[3:49:17] JakeStratic: @ctrlectrld Yea, bit of a bummer imo but it is to get the focus more on the RP than being great at the game. To my understanding.
[3:49:19] troyofathyns: because of a LOCKPICK
[3:49:21] threatlvlmidnight215: not wanting to go to jail why else?

[4:58:04] CrystalDimension: @EsfandTV it's fail RP
[4:58:09] ColbaeTV: @imSteffin, the whole point is the hood has to be open to access it, so how would you acess it from under?
[4:58:09] Static_ii: if youre stealing it the animation should take longer
[4:58:12] geo_logic_: its a little powerful, but yeah i wouldnt know that if i wasnt a car person

[4:58:19] Leafyerick: @ColbaeTV I would say yes IF opening the engine bay didn't make you mechanic under the car

[4:58:34] KaycasTV: that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not power gaming

[4:58:37] IllusiOGnarly: just yeeted to the water with sharks
[4:58:41] HadEbola: a powergame would be siiting in the car and still being able to pull the turbo
[4:58:41] the_main_burt: @badperson1234 maybe not in city, but there is definitely logs of him doing it
[4:58:41] Seananigans_13: also a turbo is like 2 screws take off IRL isn't it
[4:58:41] jeffrey778: that is the intended purpus of the mechanic, no pun intended
[4:58:43] ManakinEU: the average person knows its scummy as fuck to just wait down their until someone opens their hood id say
[4:58:43] Toastedgamer03: yeah game mechanic allows you to do that, and most people don't know shit about cars so they wouldn't know it is power gaming NODDERS
[4:58:47] Prepper_Jack: in reality it's a pretty complex task, not like throwing in a new air filter
[4:58:54] WayILive: bro i dont know why they just dont add somthing to make it take time to take out turbo/etc like repair kit @EsfandTV  simple fix
[4:58:55] ColbaeTV: @Leafyerick, good point, but since the hood needs to be open it makes me feel like the turbo is under the hood. kinda just doesnt make sense either way ig
[4:58:57] SmugPls: The power game is doing it and doing it instantly, its the fact its instantaneaus and done from out of view. If it had timer or sound maybe different
[4:59:02] Beep_Cx: angy ü•ú

[11:40:02] CopperKat: I can see why the Mayor perceived it as the person who controls the most guns in the city while the citizens DON'T HAVE ANY as an ALARMING thing to hear though @EsfandTV
[11:40:04] Nick_The_Mechanick: she literally said they should vote to overthrow the council

[11:40:17] MattMane262: @esfandtv I honestly love that you keep push off FF. Its so funny to me!

[11:40:21] explodedrat: throw Ruth under the bus & become Commissioner & then, control the Batman
[11:40:21] SamBamSodaCan: It's def not treason. She just said something

[11:40:22] ville_83: PD needs to ocean dump Ruth
[11:40:23] scotty2thotty18: @nick_the_mechanick that doesn't make it treason yet
[11:40:25] ScarfaceCEO: I think Max intends to use this as leverage for a lesser charge.
[11:40:25] Mr_Jaffs: Its 100% Treason given what happened in the hall afterwards
[11:40:26] fixer_18: Her phone records could show something tho
[11:40:26] MulattoExpress: couldn‚Äôt have happened to a better person

[11:40:28] Mr_Antisocial: it‚Äôs all to make an example
[11:40:28] Neekapkilla: Its definitely not treason but in a civilized world one would be removed from their position for saying it. In today's world though people say way worse things with no consequences (IRL)
[11:40:28] Wynter282: max only wants it done so he can fire her anyway
[11:40:29] Clodhoppr: @wafflehous true that clip crazy

[11:40:36] TheLastRace: @EsfandTV Her other statement in the hallway definatly was treason ... but that was only for the 3 captains so no one should know it
[11:40:37] MattMane262: Lets go Cornman!
[11:40:38] booyaaaaaaaaaaaaa: she said the word treason then they jumped on it

[11:40:40] Rohkeus: Moon OOCly mentioned he doesn't think/knows it's not treason either, but it was a good way to get him into the PD
[11:40:41] Zolothan: her hallway comment wasn't great
[11:40:41] Berserake: if it wasnt being pushed this hard then she would still be active and on duty
[11:40:41] CopperKat: she controls all the guns in the city while the citizens currently have none so...it is still alarming
[11:40:41] Wetidiot: you should check what she said in the hallway right after it
[11:40:41] taraannee: well it was fucking dumb they tried to push a murder charge on u lmao
[11:40:43] spazticbull: yeah but it was dumb the stuff for you was being pushed so far as well
[11:40:43] MahanGM: RUTH RIPBOZO

[11:40:53] naydnn: SEDITION is what she is guilty of, not treason
[11:40:55] e1onmadetwitterfascist: true ot‚Äòs like saying ‚Äöwhat if i kill someone‚Äò. there‚Äòs no way i get charged for murder because of that‚Ä¶

[11:41:11] Zeph_202: I think if it was just the comment you could argue it wasnt, but OOC what she said in the hall after really shows it was not a joke

[11:41:16] ArdentCause: exactly - that part can be used but its too hard to prove it unless someone spoke out about that moment

[11:41:36] geo_logic_: it all started that way tbf
[11:41:38] Basard21: ooc they are adding a statement she didnt say before the reason statement in the office and then they talked about it after and she said she wouldnt listen to the legislation

[11:41:39] Joongi_: GETALIFE TREASON
[11:41:40] sshineysean: @esfandtv do you consider it treason, what Ruth said on the way out of the office ‚Äúthat she flat out wouldn‚Äôt enforce this legislation if passed‚Äù ‚Ä¶ because slacks lying that he doesn‚Äôt remember is kinda Sketchy ‚Ä¶ but of course, nobody but the 3 captains heard that ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

[11:41:42] ZenBanditX22: he literally told her they werent doing this as he said he would
[11:41:43] CrAZeD88: true
[11:41:44] mercs99: you can argue what she said in the office was not treason, but afterwards in private that shit was wild. especially because Turner was also saying the same shit
[11:41:46] TheLadyCupcake: objection weird
[11:41:47] layziep: Heh heh heh
[11:41:48] energizergeyser: pepeLaugh nothing to hide

[11:41:54] DieterK: she should've just been fired or heavily demoted and dapped @EsfandTV
[11:41:57] holyknightfran: I thought ruth self-suspended herself ic? kekw
[11:41:57] Zeph_202: I think the way she reacted in the hall after shows she was serious and not joking
[11:41:57] go_davo_go: lol "he he he"
[11:41:58] IllusiOGnarly: i mean not that i dont wanna see someone get a firing squad
[11:41:58] Joongi_: Kappa
[11:42:01] dawnof2morrow: Slacks looks like a child talking to his mom

[11:42:03] honestnandaba: Kappa
[11:42:03] xktpopx: Give slacks a hug
[11:42:05] M__Wolfe: Saying, "If this legislation passes I refuse to take orders from the mayor" Is very questionable. But it was a private convo between the captains

[11:42:14] ZenBanditX22: y is slacks trying so hard for ruth when he knows the truth

[11:42:17] GwG_Torch: just like the review meeting, I digged it
[11:42:18] pappardelle_papi: Skacks loves platitudes
[11:42:18] taraannee: there‚Äôs a reason slacks was telling her that they couldn‚Äôt do what she wanted of not listening to the law. thats crazy
[11:42:19] jadetortoise: yuudye impeachment is not treason
[11:42:20] iNF3RNO_ZA: @dawnof2morrow a beard goes a long way
[11:42:21] snakcz: enhanced interrogation allowed?
[11:42:25] brikbeans: @mercs99 slacks doesnt remember that <3
[11:42:27] MulattoExpress: Ruth suspended herself so no one else could get the satisfaction of doing it
[11:42:29] mercs99: @M__Wolfe at this poiint unless slacks says something theres zero chance turner or ruth tell the truth on that
[11:42:30] Roundie_au: Cornwood's junk is right in his face.  such a power move
[11:42:31] Wetidiot: that was 311 not state announcement wasnt it?
[11:42:35] djsweet2: So if turner brings up the conversation on the stairs Ruth could be screwed
[11:42:44] RG_SargeXB: @EsfandTV HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT GETTING TPAIN IN HERE?
[11:42:45] taraannee: i‚Äôm curious if slacks will mention she wanted them to try to impeach max LUL
[11:42:46] layziep: What does Slacks think about the allegations that him and Ruth are together that I just made up
[11:42:48] TimmayHS: uh oh... they did
[11:42:50] SmilingRob: mayor probably has said more treasonous things
[11:42:51] IllusiOGnarly: mayoral change isnt even impeachment
[11:42:51] Kalious78: I hope Max used privileges to install security cameras no one knows about or cornball overheard it as he said he was In the hallway
[11:42:51] steven__99: @e1onmadetwitterfascist evidence tampering requires an active investigation, there wasnt one
[11:42:55] blastingbubba: @mercs99 yeppers
[11:42:55] TimmayHS: they're planning to impeach with etta right?
[11:42:56] M__Wolfe: @mercs99 Yeah, thats why im super interested to see what happens cause it could potentially blow up completely on them. LLike a live nade
