[2:07:57] skinnylegend000: def look into rubber bullets. less lethal - same protection.
[2:08:00] sBuon: Just pretend to be Collin from BBMC and they'll give you one Kappa
[2:08:13] themanwithanrx7: prob a safety course, etc
[2:08:27] alyx_bunny43: @lyoniscute that doesn't sound legal lol
[2:08:28] sBuon: 12?!
[2:08:50] watermelon3001: Seems legit NODDERS
[2:08:52] AlteredData: Do they give gun licenses to alcoholics? Kapp
[2:09:05] sBuon: HUHH
[2:09:06] omarwfh: GAT6
[2:09:22] FlameReetardantPanda: I assume hunting
[2:09:22] VectorFalcon: No thats right.  People take their young teenage children and teach them hunting. It isn't unreasonable.
[2:09:23] Gobukiller: It's for hunting. Big hunting culture in Canada
[2:09:28] sBuon: Conklin by the window AAAA
[2:09:30] ZealousCrow: Gun licenses in Canada are for hunting
[2:09:38] kaleidoskopeyes: for hunting I assume, if it‚Äôs like parts of the US you can get license under 18 but can‚Äôt own
[2:09:50] sBuon: WAITING
[2:09:51] Gobukiller: Hunting/protection from wild animals
[2:09:53] ZealousCrow: So kids can go hunting with their parents
[2:10:36] harrison6286: are you looking to get a real gun?
[2:10:41] sBuon: guns can evolve now it's pretty cool, Fire gun class has totally been buffed over water guns though
[2:10:46] ZealousCrow: Guns for self defense isn't really a thing in Canada btw
[2:11:04] ZealousCrow: Like, legally
[2:11:36] ZealousCrow: Basically the whole reason why Canada has no gun violence compared to the US
[2:11:43] sBuon: Custard rn: PepoThink
[2:11:54] harrison6286: O seems like she‚Äôs high as a kite
[2:12:00] Quacced: Supressors?
[2:12:01] FlameReetardantPanda: the kind America loves
[2:12:06] sBuon: those 2 guns on either side of your body for sure
[2:12:12] VectorFalcon: So pistols
[2:12:13] watermelon3001: Now, hear me out. Do you really need it? I mean, if the world goes to shit, do you wanna live in a world without food delivery? Hmmge
[2:12:13] ZealousCrow: handguns
[2:12:14] VectorFalcon: which aren't for hunting
[2:12:33] SharaHeartSixxx: Ohh???
[2:12:38] kaleidoskopeyes: probs because pistols are concealable
[2:13:11] Gobukiller: @kaleidoskopeyes they're also easier to use for self-harm, which is the leading cause of gun fatalities
[2:13:13] sBuon: so your 2 arms you have rn are illegal
[2:13:28] VectorFalcon: Anything concealable essentially
[2:13:29] straysinger_music: why are 25s and 32s restricted? seems random
[2:13:38] sBuon: AAAA
[2:13:38] Nightbot: AAAA
[2:13:39] mojjo627: extended mags are probably prohibited
[2:13:42] xMistressMayhem: lol
[2:13:42] kaleidoskopeyes: @gobukiller ooh true, always forget that part
[2:13:43] sBuon: OOC SHOTGUN METAAAAAAAAAAAAA
[2:13:52] MrHyde81: Shit, are we doing The Sweet Spot with McNulty?
[2:13:53] VSDuck: If you want a firearm you can have a "Normal" pistol
[2:14:00] ZealousCrow: You also need to have a gun safe IIRC
[2:14:00] deadrotten20: its the meta bwo
[2:14:08] VectorFalcon: Umm, as a retired Marine, a 12 guage pump action is EXACTLY what i would want for home defence
[2:14:27] Gobukiller: @kaleidoskopeyes Yup. The waiting periods aren't just for background checks, they're also to keep you from making a rash decision
[2:14:31] VectorFalcon: No, listen...
[2:14:41] sBuon: I mean you already have a 12 gauge pump ifywim ltcustFlower
[2:14:43] showgirl_: unrestricted test was ez in canada
[2:14:47] VectorFalcon: Everyone knows what the racking action of a shotgun sounds like, you never actually need to fire the thing.
[2:14:55] SharaHeartSixxx: KEKW
[2:15:04] mojjo627: so you don't need amunition
[2:15:28] sBuon: Nerdge Collection
[2:15:46] VSDuck: Custy you can also get those restricted firearms it's just another permit/ course you have to take
[2:15:51] MrHyde81: @mojjo627 Good point
[2:16:04] ZealousCrow: I think collection is talking about for antique weapons and stuff

[2:16:54] VSDuck: what Showgirl said it's just two exams or one all in one
[2:17:15] showgirl_: just ask you to load n unload it
[2:17:20] mojjo627: @DieMrCupCake  that's why i'm in SC...I'm the only one of my friends who doesn't have one
[2:17:23] showgirl_: course walks you through it don‚Äôt stress
[2:17:32] xMistressMayhem: Ngl thats not bad

[2:18:46] MountainBrute: also hi from Esfand
[2:18:51] ZealousCrow: Like, they literally banned all handgun sales recently
[2:19:01] MountainBrute: are you in Canada?
[2:19:09] ZealousCrow: Because statistically having one makes you SO much less safe
[2:19:11] showgirl_: need unrestricted to get restricted
[2:19:30] Quacced: Wut
[2:19:36] MrHyde81: Shotgun it is then
[2:19:37] Lyoniscute: Honestly custy if you wanted a firearm I would move to Utah or Michigan
[2:19:39] VSDuck: that's probably true just look at the US
[2:19:43] VSDuck: AAAA
[2:19:43] Nightbot: AAAA
[2:19:53] FlameReetardantPanda: SHITSHOW
[2:19:54] mojjo627: hard to have an accidental shooting if you don't own a gun
[2:19:55] Quacced: @Lyoniscute No
[2:19:59] Gobukiller: It's self harm, chat. Hanguns make you less safe from yourself
[2:20:03] Lyoniscute: Not true a hand gun makes you 100 times safer in a bad situation
[2:20:10] MountainBrute: im a non-restricted gun owner, the nuance from the Liberal gun ban makes it  more or lkess impossible to get pistols and cool guns anymore
[2:20:23] sBuon: okay chat let's not get political now :)
[2:20:25] themanwithanrx7: perhaps lets not debate gun politics/stats
[2:20:31] MountainBrute: unless you have a prohib licence
[2:20:32] mojjo627: i wonder what the actual stats are...time to research
[2:20:49] themanwithanrx7: too many opinions heh
[2:21:00] MountainBrute: which is extremely difficult to get unless your a gov official or instructor etc.
[2:21:03] Gobukiller: @Lyoniscute And those situations are way less common than the situations where a handgun makes you less safe
[2:21:05] FlameReetardantPanda: this happens every gun convo lol, it's inevitable
[2:21:11] VSDuck: @sBuon I Was gonna go in on a comment but I'll be good peepoShy
[2:21:11] sBuon: chat
[2:21:14] Lyoniscute: Spoon hello cutie I just reconnected and I didn't get to say hi back
[2:21:19] sBuon: enough of the gun convo
[2:21:24] Quacced: Anyway... So about Custy's keyboard

[2:21:49] watermelon3001: Is it easier to get a gun if you're a cop in GTA RP? HMM
[2:21:51] VSDuck: the huh?
[2:21:56] Lyoniscute: @gobukiller I'll like to priv message you on my knowledge if you would like
[2:22:03] sBuon: we buying a bird HYPERS
[2:22:05] MountainBrute: basically shotguns and rifles are all you can get right now, untill the gun bans are appealed
[2:22:19] junk_dog96: Its probably the same reason why you cant buy a pistol in the uk, you can conceal a pistol but good luck hiding a 12 gauge in public
[2:22:19] MountainBrute: and pistol calibre carbines
[2:22:23] showgirl_: can‚Äôt go wrong with winchester
[2:22:27] Gobukiller: @Lyoniscute I'm good, dude, I've seen the actual studies LUL
[2:22:40] sBuon: chat enough of the guns seriously
[2:22:43] sBuon: we're moving on

[2:22:46] themanwithanrx7: yeah
[2:23:05] MountainBrute: @junk_dog96 but concealment of any kind is serious

[2:33:04] VSDuck: is there a way to bug report?
[2:33:09] xMistressMayhem: Apparently in-game settings, down to notifications, and turn phone notifications on. That should fix it not popping up.
[2:33:11] sBuon: Yeah McNulty is regular officer NODDERS
