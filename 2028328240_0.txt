[1:02:28] aleman98: didnt shiesty see the fence when he was in the sewers?
[1:02:29] iamloyaltytv: could have it as illegal if they can ive a valid reason for having it like a mechanic to replace a key for someone that looses theirs?

[1:02:57] improvisablex: Slacks said its not enough investigation to bring to DOJ though no?
[1:03:05] g3ol0gi: so you going for making rolls and the key radar marked as illegal
[1:03:09] SuuWasTaken: @bobbybeee he'd prob get a promotion faster KEKW
[1:03:17] zrynnn: @improvisablex because all the info is directly from a CI, not from the PD itself

[1:03:29] dan_f900: You almost need like a proscribed item list
[1:03:49] ilostuniverse: We only got picture in the dirty money one, probably need to compile actual CI statements and shit
[1:03:53] bobbybeee: slacks also said you were lucky with 4head and the rolls
[1:03:57] improvisablex: You cant trust a CI. You can only investigate what they say
[1:04:06] OscarTokyo: You need foto's of somebody using it and stealing the car no ?

[1:04:28] bobbybeee: without leading
[1:04:44] dan_f900: Isnt that admission under duress though
[1:04:50] SuuWasTaken: we need to do a GAMBA
[1:04:56] SuuWasTaken: which comes first, BCSO or Promotion
[1:05:13] bobbybeee: get them to describe what it is
[1:05:18] SuuWasTaken: Exactly, same goes for promo prob LULW
[1:05:20] dan_f900: it depends on the level of questioning
[1:05:23] boozooi: what is bcso exactly
[1:05:24] improvisablex: Did chat see clip in meta on discord? (Dont watch Dean :P )
[1:05:24] dylanconlon6: go vinewood
[1:05:25] zrynnn: Max is winning 100%
[1:05:36] bobbybeee: mayoral vote?
[1:05:40] SuuWasTaken: @boozooi Blaine County Sheriff's Office
[1:05:48] SuuWasTaken: Cornwood for sheriff Prayge
[1:06:04] SuuWasTaken: i fr hope den goes bcso if cornwood becomes sheriff
[1:06:05] dan_f900: if there is a threat made like prolonged jail on the recording and its used in evidence
[1:06:07] Loser_1337: would den go with cornwood?
[1:06:08] alexzander88: Cornwood did talk to max yesterday
[1:06:10] dylanconlon6: I reckon u roam vinewood coz u could ask people what they sell the car parts for?
[1:06:10] improvisablex: Has Denzel read Cornwoods Dossier?
[1:06:20] Panos_97: BCSO would require a lot more people in the force

[1:06:31] procxyofc: what is bcso?
[1:06:39] Panos_97: There is no way the Captains will let that happen
[1:06:39] ScreenFresh: bcso isnt for a while. they dont want a split this early
[1:06:40] heat31: Does Denzel know Cornwood is hesitant to continue the Mayor run? Maybe Sheisty can swing him towards LASO
[1:06:40] g3ol0gi: probs Archer and Andrews too
[1:06:42] 1CaptainRedBeard1: Archer, Andrews, yourself, Slacks even said he would transfer.
[1:06:43] alohamanz: what are those county lines??
[1:06:45] juicytomato21: cornwood calls it LASO, the little alamo sheriff office
[1:06:48] The_YellowMist: is bsco much different? I don‚Äôt understand
[1:06:50] zrynnn: what if Ruth becomes the high command of BCSO though? KEKW

[1:07:03] Enoobrac: kinda immersion breaking you gotta screenshot everything using out of game mechanic, no?

[1:08:37] m4l1kkk: He's a thuuug
[1:08:41] 1CaptainRedBeard1: @d1nnn0 Assuming the BCSO opens there will be a good number of officers going there. That's all.
[1:08:45] 1CaptainRedBeard1: It's not set in stone or anything.
[1:08:48] dan_f900: to be fair his argument is truthful
[1:08:57] heat31: Does Denzel know Cornwood is hesitant to continue the Mayor run? Maybe Shiesty can swing him towards LASO

[1:09:35] SCPFFFF: think he was just saying it would be nice to have a camera that whould act in place of screenshotting
[1:09:45] improvisablex: Devs not doing that means they have more time to implement actual mechanics instead of visualss

[1:10:26] serpenting: douglas could of used you instead of office mcnumpty
[1:10:27] SuuWasTaken: yeah i think eno was talkin about having to screenshot speedometer and stuff, would be better if it logged the license plate + speed automatically

[1:14:57] amanmama: Google also laid off many people
[1:14:57] zrynnn: because they probably dont need them
[1:14:57] Enoobrac: I think Amazon as a whole is in a down turn

[1:15:05] chivo_502: AI
[1:15:06] Mikal_Humblebutter: for more  money
[1:15:06] JonasThe0ne: $$$$
[1:15:09] Ninjagunss: Twitch doesn't make money
[1:15:09] sendu6666: Capitalism
[1:15:10] brook_cs2: money
[1:15:11] SamuraiMotion: poor spending i assume
[1:15:13] ExpertSquare116: hasn't twitch always lost amazon money?
[1:15:14] DustMonkey: not profitable enough- but layoffs is a very common thing in the games industry overall right now
[1:15:15] ProfessorVic: they used the twitch company card on gifting hot tub streamers
[1:15:15] Mikal_Humblebutter: free money
[1:15:17] ItsSkaara: yes
[1:15:17] improvisablex: No
[1:15:19] adrian_md46: cost savings
[1:15:19] LaughingGobelins: Yea everywhere
[1:15:19] ViralZeros: They hired to many people during covid
[1:15:19] LeoWurf: Probably because alot of the roles dont do much at twitch
[1:15:19] JonasThe0ne: for sure
[1:15:22] benmaui: corporate greed
[1:15:22] T_Singh99: No
[1:15:23] improvisablex: AI is far from replacing jobs
[1:15:24] PapaClapperonae: love twitch but they probably have a bunch of people who dont do much
[1:15:24] v3x_75: people are the most expensive cost in a company
[1:15:25] zrynnn: they can probably run the company the same way after the layoffs
[1:15:25] izahkiel: YEP
[1:15:27] dan_f900: There is more competition now though and with costs rising...
[1:15:27] brook_cs2: morem workers is more liabilities more wages to pay less profitable
[1:15:27] tellos0: layoffs on Amazon?
[1:15:29] bleu_starrr: AI is part of it.
[1:15:30] armedgolem01: they have been laying people off every year for the last 5 years this is just a bigger amount
[1:15:32] amanmama: No
[1:15:32] g3ol0gi: Sky NET monkaS
[1:15:33] Vince_dev_: because twitch doesnt need 3500 people to run, they overhired alot in the pandemic
[1:15:34] mkbigc: @deansocool you seem like such a cool guy man I love your RP stuff and I get such a good vibe from you I think your pretty funny too my guy love from the UK

[1:15:37] LeoWurf: do you know your  twitch manager  deann?
[1:15:38] improvisablex: They hired too many during Covid and now are biting the bullet
[1:15:38] charliewalkez: hi solomon
[1:15:38] DustMonkey: the covid bubble popped, people were surprised that they werent making the same money as then.. so now we got layoffs
[1:15:41] izahkiel: AI is becoming a dominant market now
[1:15:43] SuuWasTaken: corporations dont exist to create jobs, they just wanna generate money.
[1:15:46] SuuWasTaken: the employees are just a number
[1:15:47] MexiBrent: i mean they are shutting down all of south korea so all those people are probably part of these lay offs
[1:15:48] KloudO2: Dean new league cinematic https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHhqwBwmRkI @Deansocool

[1:15:48] zietix__: yo
[1:15:52] Mikal_Humblebutter: AAA games industries are doing massive layoffs
[1:15:52] T_Singh99: AI can never replace human creativity, especially at a social media platform company
[1:15:53] uk_hudz: Its ok elon will buy twitch
[1:15:54] cheekyp: they're just cutting costs, idk why people are trying to rationalize it
[1:15:57] Panos_97: @Deansocool It's not AI, it's just that lots of processes have gotten more streamlined nowadays
[1:16:03] armedgolem01: twitch has been dying for the last 5 plus years
[1:16:03] xzReactz: Nike laying off like 2000 people this month

[1:16:20] Mikal_Humblebutter: it's corporate greed yo
[1:16:23] talgach: yoo dean and chat deansoLove deansoBDG
[1:16:26] dan_f900: They did it at Twitter though as well
[1:16:29] SuuWasTaken: Yoo tal
[1:16:31] Panos_97: Yeah lots of roles have become redundant
[1:16:34] ItsSkaara: A lot of tech companies hired during covid like crazy and now they face the consequences
[1:16:36] improvisablex: too many

[1:16:44] Damnitben: I love watching people slam on the brakes instead of blowing through red lights when they realize there's a cop car.
[1:16:48] MexiBrent: if thats a third then around 1500-2000
[1:16:50] Niicoriah: People doesnt seem to understand, twitch has been bleeding money since the beginning :D its like 3500 people working for twitch
[1:16:50] tellos0: so, think about it like this
[1:16:52] TheMajorGunn: TheMajorGunn subscribed with Prime. 
[1:16:53] PapaClapperonae: a lot of tech companies have more employees than they need to run it
[1:16:54] Ryaht: they can run it on alot less ppl
[1:16:55] ScreenFresh: 1500
[1:16:55] talgach: adrian bby deansoSpin deansoLove
[1:16:55] Niicoriah: you barely need 200
[1:16:56] Shepsie: 35% cut
[1:17:00] uk_hudz: Guess theres to many competitors kick youtube gaming ect
[1:17:00] amanmama: Will streamers count as employees?
[1:17:03] tellos0: they hired a lot of ppl due to the rise in traffic
[1:17:04] the__misfit: I think it's because when elon musk bought twitter and fired half of the employees, he set the precedent that all these big companies are over staffed.
[1:17:05] zrynnn: 500 people were laid off
[1:17:07] Str1de: I just wanna know how chat knows all this
[1:17:08] tellos0: now they dont need them, so bye bye
[1:17:11] Str1de: I feel let out

[1:17:17] v3x_75: no @amanmama
[1:17:19] improvisablex: 1200 to run Twitch
[1:17:21] Ryaht: 150-200
[1:17:22] bleu_starrr: 3500 Twitch employees is overkill.
[1:17:22] Niicoriah: 20% of the workforce. Look at X/Twitter
[1:17:23] tellos0: @The__Misfit he wasn't the first, mate lol
[1:17:23] ProfessorVic: at least 5 people
[1:17:26] LeoWurf: 1500 max
[1:17:26] y0nk3r5: 300
[1:17:26] SuuWasTaken: prime bleeds them money so hard but its gateway drug type shit
[1:17:27] LaughingGobelins: @T_Singh99 yea but there isn't any creativity needed in administrating ,some parts of legal dep, accounting, RH.

[1:17:53] Niicoriah: No need for more than 300 people :D what are you guys talking about haha
[1:17:55] armedgolem01: twitch doesn't make money amazon makes more money off of kick using there server then from twitch
[1:17:57] tellos0: because the answer depends on that
[1:18:00] Lageg: You realize the people you're asking have NO fucking clue though right?
[1:18:01] LeoWurf: If were talking about marketing sponsorss,  HR, Managemnt, IT dev work around 1k
[1:18:05] bleu_starrr: Yeah. 750 is fair
[1:18:08] GilbertGilberto: yeah i dont even know what the majority of work consists of at twitch
[1:18:11] LegacyTwitxh: when you think just an R&D team could easily consist of 200 people, it‚Äôs hard to estimate
[1:18:11] HyperPerky: 750 is allot jesus its more like 200 chat
[1:18:12] Str1de: @Lageg this
[1:18:12] tellos0: nah, it can be run by less than 100 ppl
