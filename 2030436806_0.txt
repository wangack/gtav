[8:00:41] MidKnightRydr: @Whippy Heres an idea for setting up tracks for Live Racing. Determine key points on your tracks for (checkpoints) and setup actual tires on the ground, like the automated system in 3.0, or big signs, for racers to drive through and help direct the flow of the course. Can get tires from chopping and save for races.
