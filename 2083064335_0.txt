Those two markings are what make any gun, serial number free or not, traceable.

[0:46:15] THE_GIGACHAD_OF_TWITCH: A gun with no serial number (which is what an "untracable gun" is) still has a muzzle bore and firing pin, a muzzle bore leaves unique to that gun striations on the bullet as it leaves the chamber and the firing pin leaves a unique to that gun mark on the bullet casing upon hitting the primer cap which is in the back of the bullet casing. Those two markings are what make any gun, serial number free or not, traceable.

[1:55:43] PWRslide2: if you catch the crims in a car chase, there should be a std fine for car damage.  like 2x the average cost of repair for one car at min.

[1:56:43] CopperKat: yeah and in 4.0 they made things like revs, vehicle weight, and suspension matter
[1:56:43] shin5sato3: @EsfandTV have you considered just silent banning? bringing it up puts the spotlight on the losers and kinda ruins the vibe for the rest of chat who isn't doing anything wrong.
[1:56:43] Vahlroc_: Just need more mods and more bans tbh
[1:56:44] bighappyturtl3: It's also 100% okay to not always get a W. So if the crim gets away chat doesn't need to backseat and get mad
[1:56:44] ZiroArchon: Some of you chatters need to perma your accounts.
[1:56:45] grlgunk: I don‚Äôt know anything I don‚Äôt question anything I‚Äôve just been sick as hell and I am enjoying the hell of you
[1:56:45] slimetime9090: @esfandtv not complaining at all so don‚Äôt get the wrong idea but a few years ago when I played pd on a rp server I found all the pd mods and would load the game solo to just learn all the roads and jumps but that worked with me also helped with learning the different cars

[1:57:48] bighappyturtl3: Also chat, I left after Santa told him he would show him the moonshien spot. Did cornwood end up seeing it?
[1:57:48] mitchj2024: the effort and time that goes into the entertainment you provide for us just sitting here is unreal.

[1:58:04] munchkiin_: Btw Esfand, if they do a more instructor position on PD, do you think Cornwood would be an instructor? He has the vibe of an amazing mentor.
[1:58:05] smuffi: damn that was exciting to watch, sad it ended
[1:58:06] re4mcore: De-escalation

[1:58:16] broken_arrows: Chat are you misbehaving

[1:58:31] Winter7735: danBlankies
[1:58:36] thestolentimes: Aziz is one of the best drivers the PD has.
[1:58:37] MysticaIly: I feel like, if you are using your vehicle as a weapon, lethal should be allowed by cops to reduce the risk of death or injury to civilians or government.
[1:58:37] hushbang: faxToss
[1:58:38] lzrdwzrdtv: chat just loves back seating and they think their request will be granted at every instance

[1:58:48] wastington: community outreach YEP
[1:58:49] skyliner80: Your rapport with criminals helps with de-escalation.
[1:58:52] jy33130: Aziz for ass chief
[1:58:55] xblasphemye: @MysticaIly 100 percent
[1:58:57] CamGG__: @skeletonmike I know a lot did in 3.0 but idk 4.0 rules
[1:58:58] ZuldeadTV: Nopixel cars are completely different than driving normal GTA. I've played on public, cars are really made of paper
[1:59:00] bighappyturtl3: @galidorn269 ohhhh thats probably a smart server rule
[1:59:01] muztho: rumour has it someone in la has taken groupe 8 delievery to serious and hit the streets in a box van

[1:59:23] chen094: i miss anything in the last 30 chat?
[1:59:26] SESHBEATS999: Aziz sounds like Zoidberg from Futurama
[1:59:27] mitchj2024: imagine working on a tv series where you‚Äôre the only director and only actor. only camera guy. literally all solo
[1:59:29] lzrdwzrdtv: Nerdge

[1:59:33] n0oxaskek: chat get to writing his statement now before he shoots the next guy KEKW

[2:00:00] DrWetbone: driving while reading chat after 10+ hours of streaming after waiting hours for food to arrive while talking on in game radio and getting in game phone calls would be impossible for 99.9% of chatters. so don‚Äôt listen to their critique.
[2:00:02] KhrisOsaurus: üî´ KKona
[2:00:03] bluff1n: hope your neck heals up homie <3
[2:00:05] munchkiin_: @Zarniwooper hoping to make more money soon, a guy can hope, studying a ton and working towards that
[2:00:05] blazemarley: @skeletonmike yeah definitely unfair when your using controller against a kbm. very few are actually good on kbm
[2:00:06] alaterra: is this a custom server?

[2:18:29] jdickson93: @HadEbola could he find the source by muting everything and going one at a time to match them up?
[2:18:29] iMods: oh yeah it was really quiet
[2:18:30] karpachino: @shmeeso the RP server I used to play on, it controlled like custom music from players cars and the radios clicks, just couldnt remember if it messed with voice chat volume at all.

[2:19:18] Alfurias: @lolheads580r abs of steel

[2:19:58] Cthyllah: ?
[2:19:59] RossTheBoss__: Could you have it going through 2 different outputs?
[2:20:05] HadEbola: a simple restart could fix it but then you have to restart stream and everything sometimes computers just bug for no real reason
[2:20:06] huSiOx: @Ragestrike just using up resources LULE
[2:20:13] karpachino: @Cthyllah maybe, i honestly didnt even think ab that.

[2:23:44] doublexpeach57: Just to let you know esfand I'd ont understand why people moan at you stuff I listen to you while I'm at work so funny to listen to awaome content I laugh outload sometimes and customers think I'm crazy lol keep up the great stream brother

[2:24:07] jdickson93: @Toastedgamer03 yeah it makes no sense to release something that is behind what we had already. full retail release should be at the same level we had prior imo
[2:24:09] Mag3wins: does the in-game radio have a volume adjustement?
[2:24:10] RoadwarriorTV: @RoadwarriorTV idk im just memeing xdd
[2:24:21] Ragestrike: maybe you need to talk to timmac or something hes an audiofile
[2:24:25] munchkiin_: @doublexpeach57 Yea I appreciate Esfand streanming this early to listen to him while working. It's great.
[2:24:25] lepacaJQ: there should be an independent radio volume in one of the tabs ATC i think its called
[2:24:32] BananaSafari: esfand you need to hire a pro audio eng
[2:24:34] Toastedgamer03: @jdickson93 not anymore with software like even look at games they release half finished most of the time now
[2:24:43] donbena_: FeelsOkayMan keep up the great work Esfand @EsfandTV
[2:24:46] Toastedgamer03: software is just release something and add to it as time goes by
[2:24:47] Khaosshinobi: @EsfandTV i might be wrong but is there not seperate sliders for voice and radio on top of the SFX slider?, if you scroll down i dont have the client i just didn't get a good look at the other bars
[2:24:47] TimmayHS: I bet there's a way to receive the nopixel audio in a 3rd party program, but you'd probably need special access/perms from nopixel to get that setup.
[2:24:48] GooseyOfficial: @EsfandTV i have no idea if this is true for your setup. but fivem typically has two seperate sound applications in windows audio mixer. the alternate one may be radio voices
[2:24:48] BananaSafari: get you a 24-channel mixer
[2:24:49] LHaxorP: @EsfandTV, wonder if you can console command a negitive radio setting

[2:32:50] Recon_XoX: Nobody Asked

[2:33:15] wastington: @OniCr0w don't ask..
[2:33:16] frostflakeheron: vgyna
[2:33:19] CamGG__: @FireyFly brother my point is why would NP pay for costs that they could avoid. hosting their own websites for this would not be cheap. thats the entire reason imgur no longer allows them to use theirs.
[2:33:21] vogtivogel: kind of
[2:33:23] bebby: It is like imgur
[2:33:25] seksmuhchine: well when a mom
[2:33:28] howyaben: @onicr0w Google it :)
[2:33:29] edenobi: Is there a switch to Final Fantasy riebirth setting? Kappa
[2:33:30] Ragestrike: vgy.me is a free and easy to use image hosting service for everyone.  Upload your images of choice and share them anywhere you like.
[2:33:31] FelipeLLs: Susge
[2:33:32] sKingNA: @frostflakeheron What are you 12?
[2:33:32] ShaneyRL: Yoooo
[2:33:35] Lofty916: Yes (I don't know)
[2:33:35] icyunvme20: what happened to imgur

[2:33:39] MaNSoN6649: Whats the other officers using now
[2:33:41] Wintyer2: imgbox no account needed
[2:33:44] CamGG__: yes give us your email NOW
[2:33:45] ManakinEU: @InsecureForSure probably because its useless traffic for them

[2:33:54] ScyThE619: i feel that pain

[2:33:55] AltarCrystal: YTMND
[2:33:56] FireyFly: @CamGG__ as I said, each time they start using another service, they will keep blocking them, thus they lose all their old images. In case of PD that sounds quite important...
[2:34:01] DannyL3tscher: Susge british imgur
[2:34:03] Berserake: No matter what you do i think youll have to make an account imo
[2:34:07] Ragestrike: Uploads are deleted if they violate our Terms of Service, have not been viewed for more than 6 months for anonymous uploads, or have not been viewed for more than 1 year for uploads linked to an account.
[2:34:10] N3mEe: All that is needed is an account, and an User Key.  To generate a User Key, you will need to visit your Account Details page.
[2:34:10] ClutchMoses: @InsecureForSure No ad revenue since images were embedded instead of the site being opened to view
[2:34:13] Alfurias: tea and crumpets Susge
[2:34:13] forgotheals: sharex allows you to take photos and upload them whenever you want

[2:34:21] Wintyer2: @FireyFly there probly a log of files on the pc
[2:34:21] Ghios: VGY looks like a website that I could make.
[2:34:23] hammiesxo: Susge innit

[2:34:47] Capn_Stew: Waiting
[2:34:48] BaconHouseFive: give us your data Evilge
[2:34:49] FireyFly: @Wintyer2 yes, and then you have to manually upload all of the images back that you've uploaded for months to a new website, and link them all to the correct incident...
[2:34:54] Alfurias: @Sadisticmedic xanga
[2:34:55] FelipeLLs: doodEvil he fell for it

[2:34:58] DirtyFernie: ask @whippy his Cop character dealt with this
[2:34:59] FelipeLLs: doodEvil
[2:34:59] Toastedgamer03: @FireyFly honestly you are right where they will use another service and that service will block them due to too much traffic raising bills, but the simple solution is to pay to use the service
[2:34:59] vikes1011: Nerdge
[2:35:01] InsecureForSure: Waiting

[2:35:20] CrystalDimension: doesn't google itself has a image service like that ?
[2:35:21] DrEZPZ: apologies if I missed it, why don‚Äôt they want to use imgur anymore?
[2:35:22] vogtivogel: @EsfandTV Destinations -> Destination Settings -> vgy
[2:35:22] sKingNA: Imgur also blocks VPN traffic now too, its quickly becoming unusable for what a lot of ppl use it for
[2:35:27] CamGG__: login.here/butts
[2:35:28] Ragestrike: You dont, you get a user key
[2:35:28] FireyFly: @Toastedgamer03 it would be cheaper to just make their own tbh LUL

[2:35:41] KingKova: wait Winzip is free?!?! I‚Äôve been paying for nothing all these years???
[2:35:42] beachasaurus_rex: @Toastedgamer03 just paying for the service is infinitely less costly than making their own image hosting platform lol
[2:35:49] Toastedgamer03: click destination settings in the same place you selected the different provider
[2:35:49] Fitztacular: time to retire YEP

[2:36:41] Alfurias: ow
[2:36:42] CamGG__: cant believe mr k hacked the PD and disabled all evidence photos thats crazy
[2:36:43] Toastedgamer03: @beachasaurus_rex no hosting a service is a lot more expensive than using a service with a plan that gives you unlimited use for a monthly subscription KEKW
[2:36:44] sKingNA: @Berserake That makes too much sense
[2:36:50] Capn_Stew: Can't park there Stare

[2:37:04] carrotgames_: @KooolAidzz channel points
[2:37:05] doobae: It has to be an image host? It'd be nice if 5m could allocate server storage for screenshots, then you could just use win+shft+s
[2:37:07] MOONSAGEx: @EsfandTV Uploads to VGY get deleted after 1 year if not viewed :)

[2:42:24] BlueEcko: Too many people who've never used ShareX being super "helpful"

[2:53:10] benlames: Do what chat says Kappa

[2:54:10] JakeTheYachtsman: File extension on the url shouldn't matter
[2:54:11] SurfaceMC: @EsfandTV use AWS s3, sharex has a tutorial, takes some time but its by far the best option since its free and AWS is HUGE, very reliable, and not exclusively images. also if u dont wanna use free tier, its $0.023/GB/month
[2:54:12] LogicWeasel: photobucket or gyazo shoud have the .png at the end
[2:54:14] rhine1000: @EsfandTV Settings tab at the top of the site theres a check box to put file extensions

[2:55:04] Janman88: @DismalShark he is not wrong with it beeing alot of hassle to always add that
[2:55:07] imSteffin: i love how people are like completely missing what the goal is and just shouting out random fucking things.

[3:47:53] SPxTDG: o7 Little Alamo
[3:47:53] Rohkeus: Honestly both the hospital AND PD look way better than the ones they're using right now
[3:47:59] whimzyyyy: Are the buildings connected?
[3:48:00] Beep_Cx: What's up Corndog peepoSitCowboy
[3:48:02] jd2881: Probably best to sell those turbos at this point. Just funding criminals.
[3:48:09] jacksmithcje: yes slacks the guy who said he does not care about turbos lost his turbo
[3:48:10] jifjam: they did a great job
[3:48:11] mad0monk: is your car locked?
[3:48:12] Cerkins: looks great
[3:48:13] Beep_Cx: Cozy esfandCozy

[3:48:22] InsecureForSure: its got a 70's wester vibe to it Buhh Cowboy0
[3:48:22] StillTrynaGetAHandbeezy: this looks like the PD in Twin Peaks, the wood panel interior
[3:48:23] karpachino: bisexual bathroom
[3:48:25] mattchutt: yea needs a little more space and its perfect
[3:48:30] Connorbrow: @Rohkeus MRPD is weird, it's both a maze and seems tiny at the same time LUL

[3:48:42] Dimlos: Did Laso open? Pog
[3:48:44] jacksmithcje: i think for now though it does need to be a station for pd not a whole new unit tbh
[3:48:45] ilmarcusil: @mrwriii no basement 4Shrug
[3:48:51] StillTrynaGetAHandbeezy: damn now I wanna see an Agent Cooper RPer
[3:48:52] DieterK: xdd
[3:48:52] McBeezy: Keep in mind you can get cornwood in trouble for meta people
[3:48:53] imSteffin: isn't like 90% of MRPD (the actual building itself) just like.. blocked off or unused?
[3:48:55] Joongi_: Canter xdd

[3:49:35] Canahealz: he is good

[3:49:37] lzrdwzrdtv: penis
[3:49:38] salt_succ: You think he reassembles the same furniture every time or what
[3:49:38] Beep_Cx: Hope IKEA is ISO compliant peepoSitCowboy

[3:50:04] EmDuBB13: its fuckin dumb
[3:50:04] crimboh: it is
[3:50:05] rabbyraptor: YEP
[3:50:05] ltl_wackman: @FearlessDefendr yea i thought something about trygg getting promoted
[3:50:06] Airt1: it's awful
[3:50:06] BedlessSleeper: day/month/year is better
[3:50:07] gillyp01: LUL
[3:50:07] Kiyoni: it is dumb
[3:50:09] CrystalDimension: 21?
[3:50:11] dapyman: Its very good for sorting dates
[3:50:11] evilmnkey4: ikr
[3:50:13] Rivath: Because it's wrong
[3:50:14] deadbyhunting: It's so good for sorting though
[3:50:15] thealiien: @EsfandTV bruh your just wrong, makes no sense to organize by month first
[3:50:15] skeeeperr: its is dumb, everyone uses day month year
[3:50:15] Jerti_: I like it
[3:50:15] Toastedgamer03: it is best for organization though
[3:50:16] salt_succ: I think it really depends what you're doing. For practical reading it's the worst
[3:50:16] Joongi_: This guy kekw
[3:50:18] EvilCoatrack: I use it all the time for saving files.  takes a bit to get used to it but it's great
[3:50:18] Chromatic: agreed. day/month/yr at least makes sense
[3:50:19] Cerkins: it is tbf, dd/mm/yyyy >>
[3:50:19] Toyola: its a coding thing, no one writes it like that for anything else lol
[3:50:19] TemLTemL: You will get used to it
[3:50:20] Crazyoldfool: its better for sorting
[3:50:20] pakss_14: no
[3:50:21] ActuallySupremacy: ISO is for 150iq+ people
[3:50:23] Welshstig: dd/mm/yyyy is superior
[3:50:23] ConstyUK: DD/MM//YYYY is superior
[3:50:23] Waterbottels: Day Month Year is terrible for organizing
[3:50:24] imSteffin: I'm used to it because I read a lot of ISO complaint material.
[3:50:25] Lucsvm: dd/mm/yyyy >>>>
[3:50:25] ManakinEU: just read it backwards
[3:50:25] PsychoJoker: DD/MM/YYYY KKonaW its the only right way
[3:50:25] jtm0516: because its been last our entire lives
[3:50:27] hydreixy: Americans will just have to get used to it hmjj
[3:50:27] PapaCristobal: Of course you say this when the ISO police signs off
[3:50:27] Willwarriorgame: its just good for sorting longterm
[3:50:28] ZachFromChat: could it be because you've done it the other way for 30 years
[3:50:29] Vaddix0056: Military does it like that.. also they do like 04 Mar 2024 too.
[3:50:29] Jerti_: 2024-06-03
[3:50:30] spazticbull: you are not only gonna play in 2024 though
[3:50:31] inducedcatharsis: Used to it for me, I guess just from seeing it on my PC like that
[3:50:32] thealiien: @EsfandTV its for sorting, you sort by year not month
[3:50:32] WeekendCQ: DD/MMM/YY is the best IMO
[3:50:33] shmeeso: It's only difficult because you aren't used to it
[3:50:37] StillTrynaGetAHandbeezy: because it's wrong for everyone. it's meant to be like universal for US/EU but instead it's just backwards PepeLaugh
[3:50:37] MarvMelody: ISO ReallyMad
[3:50:39] ClutchMoses: The issue with day/month/year is us americans will misread it as month/day/year. A good example would be today's date
[3:50:39] Ibiffo: it helps you say Star Date first
[3:50:40] SPxTDG: DD/MM/YYYY the way god intended KKona
[3:50:42] Airt1: objectively an awful system, like who gives a fuck about the year OMEGALAUGHING
[3:50:42] nnsLUL: its ok to be wrong
[3:50:43] Toastedgamer03: @skeeeperr nah every important business even in america uses YYYY/MM/DD KEKW
[3:50:43] ManakinEU: they are doing it for sorting purposes
[3:50:45] Cerkins: Tssk
[3:50:51] Beep_Cx: hmjj
[3:50:55] Honorspren: mm/dd/yyyy is the way
[3:50:56] ActuallySupremacy: talking shit as soon as trygg goes offduty FeelsWeirdMan
[3:50:57] Connorbrow: @WeekendCQ What planet are you on?
[3:50:57] MackPlays: @Toastedgamer03 no they fkin dont
[3:50:59] KEKW_Sadge: MM/DD/YYYY , only
[3:50:59] shmeeso: There's ISO hating snakes in the grass
[3:50:59] ltl_wackman: Pog NNS IN CHAT
[3:51:01] Sillyanne: it‚Äôs fine. he‚Äôll make a song about it
[3:51:04] singsyng: "I don't know why it's as hard as it is" same thing I ask myself every morning when I wake and remember that I am not currently camping
[3:51:04] deftcg: @toastedgamer03 delusional
[3:51:05] Zolothan: year first makes sense for running through big lists of data, it's awkward for when you're in the current year
[3:51:07] Thraxton1: It's for organizing, if you sort by date in like a spreadsheet or something it makes the most sense
[3:51:15] Beep_Cx: What's Corndog off to peepoSitCowboy
[3:51:20] d36i: honestly if they just swapped to moneths line may/jan/oct then it wouldnt ever matter what order people did the dates
[3:51:20] biscuitz1776: IS ISO an IT thing for the server since he's a Dev? @esfandtv
[3:51:21] ManakinEU: @Honorspren that is literally the worst way possible like wtf are you even saying LUL

[3:51:34] NonToxicant: yes
[3:51:34] LarBearTV: yes ... could end up being waaayyy too much traffic
[3:51:34] StillTrynaGetAHandbeezy: you can't break into other people's lockers can you?
[3:51:35] ZachFromChat: yea, but for RP sake its fine
[3:51:35] temporal_archer: not if they're connected like this
[3:51:36] MackPlays: SHARED CASH
[3:51:36] Jerti_: yes
[3:51:37] fossssey: YYYY-MM-DD in the streets, MM-DD-YYYY in the sheets
[3:51:37] Beep_Cx: Hospital can share guns pogg
[3:51:38] SimpOnMyShrimp: Rpmaker
[3:51:38] Gundaree: no it integrates
[3:51:38] itsNudeGrandpa: small town vibes
[3:51:38] Joongi_: YES
[3:51:38] serendipity3456: 06/03/2024 DD/MM/YYYY anything else is alien
[3:51:39] Frozen_Tundras: it could produce some fun RP
[3:51:39] WeekendCQ: VoteNay
[3:51:40] pobb1eb0nk: Hot ERP opportunities yah mean?
[3:51:40] iMods: yupp my thoughts exactly
[3:51:40] Chromatic: interact
[3:51:41] SergioZ444: god damn Cornwood working so hard Kappa
[3:51:41] Joongi_: Ecactly
[3:51:41] PsychoJoker: gives a chance for them to talk yeah
[3:51:42] bleedslo: fair point
[3:51:43] wildboy789789: it makes cool new interactions
[3:51:43] r3load3d84: I mean some people talk police business in the locker
[3:51:43] timtheboneman: you guys talk about some confidential things in the lockerroom and they do too probably
[3:51:43] jifjam: its good for RP
[3:51:43] zMalloc: nah, gotta make do with what you have, you are a team
[3:51:43] Arradim: ERP
[3:51:45] BaarelyLegal: peepoShy
[3:51:45] twilightbaseballscene: there should be a connecting point tho
[3:51:45] JakeStratic: @Toastedgamer03 Only if you're organizing by year ;)
[3:51:45] visidious_moz: It would be unexpected in RL
[3:51:45] InsecureForSure: share meds / share guns
[3:51:46] mrwriii: can share guns OOOO
[3:51:46] heartsonlysoren: be good since less people
[3:51:47] RebornOffline: You get to RP and interact more, yeah
[3:51:47] ChaoticSanity: I think your options are limited because the Devs want people to RP without them having to build new shit
[3:51:47] kingah123: YERP
[3:51:48] hoveringpillow: part of the small town vibe
[3:51:48] JoeSizzle7: I think it's fine as long as the armory is seperate or whatever
[3:51:49] Honorspren: @ManakinEU cause murica
[3:51:49] Connorbrow: It might make sense for transfering injured vigs
[3:51:49] lawlkat: B L E N D E D C A S H
[3:51:49] Jerti_: locker yes, evidence no
[3:51:50] trumanfu: would there be evidence storage in lockers too?
[3:51:50] EmDuBB13: year first = 0 iq gamers xdd
[3:51:50] TGH94: security risk
[3:51:51] FeralApe: unless they can steal your stuff
[3:51:51] Dimlos: Won't that make too many people in the same room?
[3:51:51] Joongi_: D:
[3:51:52] Clabberlang: Genuine question, why you so obsess on opening LASO @esfandtv
[3:51:52] Quaggsly: some ERP with the nurses
[3:51:52] OskisOG: STARE
[3:51:53] Beep_Cx: Retiring Sadge
[3:51:53] jeremyks9: Wouldn't make sense
[3:51:54] Cerkins: D: noo
[3:51:54] TriggerHappyEU: @Arradim YUP
[3:51:54] Allsayan: yeah it gives them more chances to interact
[3:51:54] Quaggsly: the male nurses
[3:51:55] Welshstig: makes cornwood's daily appointment easier LUL
[3:51:56] WeekendCQ: BOBBY CHARLES FOR SHERIFF!!
[3:51:58] Canahealz: would be but RP would be there
[3:51:59] ltl_wackman: that would be powerful but i guess you could just say its like a vacuum system or something
[3:52:00] EpicOfGiggamesh: ISO is EU and therefore socialist propaganda @esfandtv
[3:52:00] thebogeym4n: It's kind of unexpected
[3:52:01] Beep_Cx: lurkk
[3:52:02] grinch_43: is that a thing irl?
[3:52:02] CrystalDimension: but at least year/month/day makes sense from biggest to smallest time unit. Could've been worse, like year/day/month LULW
[3:52:03] rrracecarrr: Sounds like a small town thing
[3:52:03] GryzGG: Both gov employees not that weird to have a shared locker room
[3:52:03] shr00mz_09: are you actually getting the pd now?
[3:52:04] MoohamedAlii: Maybe pd and ems makes sense
[3:52:04] mrwriii: Binoculars
[3:52:06] Joongi_: Coming home o7
[3:52:06] widbar: Stare
[3:52:07] Kamdor: or have a corridor linking the two buildings
[3:52:07] Airt1: you should have a door between them but not a locker room cause in RP cops have all their shit in there and medics can be criminals
[3:52:07] destinygun: @EsfandTV they will cross each other with this distance
[3:52:08] visidious_moz: It doesnt make sense in the real world but maybe in this world
[3:52:08] Beep_Cx: Cornwood stop eavesdropping Stare
[3:52:13] widbar: Binoculars what they doing
[3:52:17] ltl_wackman: @grinch_43 yea like banks send things via vacuum tubes and stuff
[3:52:18] MackPlays: Someone should tell Cornwood
[3:52:18] Zolothan: you'll get caught up in nursing drama the closer you get to that side of things
[3:52:18] SmugPls: how about 1st wed of march 2024. Then friday is 2nd friday of march 2024 YEP
[3:52:22] cbusbb: what if cornwood can read lips OOOO
[3:52:27] the_bucket_plays: maks sense for RP reasons but also doesnt as well its a weird idia i would pitch it
[3:52:29] enfranchise_: Wait sheriffs office open??
[3:52:29] AxiosXR: AxiosXR subscribed with Prime. 
[3:52:30] Cerkins: Deafge
[3:52:30] TheEmmorf: Cornwood needs to sell the turbos before they are all stolen anyway
[3:52:33] inducedcatharsis: Sadge Kiki
[3:52:33] jvela2123: Stare
[3:52:35] tehshoe: xdd

[4:32:29] PatrickMaybe: Trippster36 yeah great storyline, our shit got stolen in 2 seconds and now our cars are slower OMEGALUL
[4:32:34] steve_more: add a "computer" into the turbos, that logs every car they have been in VIA license
[4:32:36] djsweet2: Not moseley
[4:32:36] Connorbrow: @Trippster36 The thefts aren't the issue, the problem is it's iompossible to recover them even if they do find them later
[4:32:39] quaylewastaken: ALL THE NEED TO DO IS LOCK TURBOS IN THE VEHICLES

[4:33:15] Thunderpint: I mean the solution would be to have a motor pool mechanic. Only repairs at MRPD
[4:33:17] THE_F0STERCHILD: Slap a serial number on it. Then owner takes a picture to prove its theirs
[4:33:19] WTFimnothere: Yeah they should just make it take forever to steal them like they did when crims were abusing mid chase repairs lol

[4:33:22] PacGamer: it's 5 mins of work if you askchat gpt Kappa
[4:33:23] ChaoticSanity: if you're going to add the RP of a serial number youd have to add the RP of being able to remove it. To make it like a game system is the ecaxt opposite of what theyre trying to do here.

[7:32:50] EmDuBB13: no your correct as fuck. criminals either will sell them for more, or use them in their own crim cars

[7:33:05] ChaoticSanity: its kinda messed up that you deem yourself better in judging who can and can not have a server in the PD, its gatekeeping as fuck imo

[7:33:07] PZ17leafs: Slacks literally said he's probably going to lose it

[7:33:14] Dm_ChO: share turbos, up the morale of PD
[7:33:18] skidoggg: @EmDuBB13 ya well the cops have all the turbos  there non for the crims lol
[7:33:19] bigpoints101: Pd needs to buy them off you
[7:33:20] sugarhigh_Anubis: It's not just bad it's double bad if the PD loses a turbo cause you know its going to the criminals
[7:33:21] Pwnan: It is pretty crappy the police get stuck at hospital and stops so crims ha e so many chances to steal
[7:33:21] espeiranza: @EsfandTV  don't fking trust anyone plzzzzzz
[7:33:23] Vikairius: Honestly if you buy out all the high end turbos so no one has them, then you can possibly keep PD ahead
[7:33:24] Aufan08: it‚Äôs a incentive to not get the turbo sold. @esfandtv
[7:33:24] 1manpizza: He wants to buy it, because he knows it's already gone xdd
[7:33:25] Crazyoldfool: COGGERS COGGERS COGGERS COGGERS
[7:33:26] Connortation: if he expects it to be stolen, its screwing his fellow officers to go faster for a little bit
[7:33:26] flashdmd: I think your being to protective of the turbo's, just gotta let people buy them and use them
[7:33:26] Wetidiot: The devs need to get off their ass and fix the issue with turbos before you give them out
[7:33:27] DismalShark: give/sell him one, go with him and steal it to teach him a lesson
[7:33:28] squirtlehermit: yeah but it feels less fun for the server to hoard the turbos and not use them
[7:33:28] RietArtwork: xdd
[7:33:30] chipwitley: sell for 10k for officers 220k for slacks
[7:33:30] Waterbottels: Just resell them and wash your hands of it

[7:33:42] heartsonlysoren: 88 4 15

[7:33:42] EmDuBB13: @skidoggg what?
[7:33:42] powerfulstranger: He deserves an 88
[7:33:43] ghesh98: holy turbos
[7:33:43] Protomateria: turbos were a mistake
[7:33:44] spexs_5: i mean just keep hording them and telling people you bought them for the PD.  its a funny bit since everyone will just stop asking you
[7:33:46] Neekapkilla: So are you just saving all these turbos for when there is a mechanic that makes it harder to steal/easier to apprehend? If so maybe you should explain that in RP to people, reason being is it comes off as you are gatekeeping turbos to other cops
[7:33:46] Mindhysteria: tbh wait till they buff the time to take them out
[7:33:46] AndHaka54: the problem who knows when they'll add a layer of protection to turbo jacking @EsfandTV
[7:33:46] selectedambient: Bro hook him up though, PD good vibes come on
[7:33:47] condor2104: Dont make sense what you are saying
[7:33:48] twilightbaseballscene: yeah something has to change with turbos
[7:33:48] kratoids: hoarding in a game is weird
[7:33:49] Dm_ChO: 83mm for 10k to slack is a good deal
[7:33:50] Lite_Ice: is there only a limited amount of turbos in the city ?
[7:33:51] cashcody69: would you rather him buy it from mr.k giving crims more incentive to steal them
[7:33:52] aidynnn: any 99s left?
[7:33:52] catfish_quackenbush: You should focus on the proper HOW TOs with owning the turbos. And then start putting the 83s out there
[7:33:52] ComaToasted: didn't slacks vote
[7:33:53] EmeraldTiger888: that looks so tasty

[7:34:01] Short_Film: Short_Film subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! WideHardo
[7:34:03] bzerk26: it's on them and you're making money on the deal and it's only an 83 not a 99
[7:34:03] condor2104: You cant just hoard them and do what?
[7:34:04] EmDuBB13: people saying its hoarding cuz their iq is too low to comprehend mechanics
[7:34:05] missmuffet: crims already have turbos. cops need them
[7:34:06] TheEmmorf: 15K is a little high
[7:34:06] SwitchBord001: Time for food stuffs. YUM
[7:34:07] KYslippy: establish a disclaimer for turbos LUL
[7:34:08] Inz4ne_: if cornwood thinks turbo helps catch a crim he would do it I think
[7:34:09] Gachiguru: They need some sort of vehicle alarm like the house alarm to go off when your car is broken into

The guy could have shot you and ran out when PD showed but instead just left you and tried to get out without shooting only to be shot in the back when making the conscious decision to not pull his gun out.  It's not like he was at risk of actually evading either.  He just sank his car and the pickup car was on the opposite side of the river and already being harassed.  Feels a bit preemptive to me

[10:00:26] SmugPls: @Gundaree the problem is in teh past/ on other servers water in RP servers washes away DNA for some reason, so people get upset when that opposite is argued

[10:02:43] sevenevilmuffins: To get DNA on the gun he would have to posses it at some point so thats possession automatically

[10:19:37] Wynter282: how are you even making a deal with him he has given you ZERO information he has controlled the entire situation
[10:19:37] iwannanuhh: Because alot of other people constantly try and pull one over on other people, so they assume everyone has bad intentions
[10:19:37] jinnytolls: True
[10:19:38] suzibaguzi: but if you end up removing the charge from the incident who is going to know you had it on the menu in the first place
[10:19:38] splooshtasticals: Take ur time bruh. Don't go at his pace.
[10:19:40] HashtagSoBlessed: What you‚Äôre trying to do makes sense, but arguing about charges to other cops in front of the suspect for a long time is a bad look

[10:19:41] maestro__21: I mean honestly there shouldnt be dna when its in heavy running water

[10:19:44] emsobii: Cornwood is just maintaining the standard of proper charges to save a potential downfall of the PD for generations

[10:19:51] Koolers_Mobile: I agree your right in what your trying to do but cornwood as a lawyer knows he can't be apart of this as the victim.
[10:19:51] Berserake: Slacks doesnt want to push it because of RP reasons, like the DNA being washed and the gun washing out the car
[10:19:51] afghanpsycho: @EsfandTV Just have slacks call gatbsy as well
[10:19:52] ArdentCause: yes and also no, because he understands it so you can always make a PD announcement explaining it rather than making him go through this anyways
[10:19:54] insanealec: So what if it doesn't stick anyway? Isn't that the point of having a courtroom?!

[10:19:57] jacobtplatt: Bruh HIS DNA WAS LITERALLY ON THEGUN......
[10:19:57] Connorbrow: @theemmorf because if they're not told of everything they might be negotiating assuming the charges are complete. Some officers are self negotiating then getting annoyed when people try to drop more charges

[10:20:01] thysiastery: why dotn yall get a prosecuter
[10:20:01] nimbleop: You have the dna, its a win
[10:20:01] Neiara__: @esfandtv YOU HAVE DNA on the gun I don‚Äôt understand what the issue is
[10:20:01] Clodhoppr: mr K aint going to care whether it helps officers, he‚Äôs just rp‚Äôing the scenario to what he believe will get him the best deal
[10:20:02] xblasphemye: slacks is saying dns=a doesnt equal possession
[10:20:02] Ross_McD: Maybe try flat out explanation, no hidden words. You have a charge and evidence, let a judge decide
[10:20:03] DaZooKidd420: It's a 100k charge most other cops won't ever look back on this situation and will do what they want regardless
[10:20:04] Mouso9: He could fight it, so what he won't win
[10:20:05] catfish_quackenbush: He doenst think it will stick because he knows Mr K and the fact it was in the water and such
[10:20:06] 420warlock: he said he could fight it in court not that it wouldn‚Äôt stick
[10:20:06] LHaxorP: PD needs to process the same ways they can descretion thier way but they shoudl be presenting all charges upfront for the whole event
[10:20:06] maestro__21: Dna when its in running water is honestly fail rp
[10:20:07] chewymorsel: its frustrating as a long time nopixel viewer to see this premature rush to charges and this fear of charges being overturned so "dont push".
[10:20:07] 1manpizza: Let the courts decide then, not slacks LULE
[10:20:07] xblasphemye: but i dont understand that
[10:20:08] Sweet_BabyJeebus: bro just forget Slacks already
[10:20:11] cjdudeman: The robbery is the action, the possession is what was taken.
[10:20:12] Aphotice: imagine justin kidd as a lawyer lol
[10:20:12] Berserake: Cheer100 Slacks doesnt want to push it because of RP reasons, like the DNA being washed and the gun washing out the car
[10:20:13] warner05: Slow Down, he's got plenty of time.  Get it right brother
[10:20:13] 1MILKBOY: @EsfandTV Its getting very construed at this point maybe it's best to not push it right now and wait till court to say it might show up
[10:20:14] jinnytolls: @EsfandTV Definitely need to articulate your argument better. The missing pieces like the DNA and getting the stories straight first really help you along with the judges testimony
[10:20:14] phaden_: are people really arguing that it's because you threw the gun on the ground? He was told to. at gun point Pepega
[10:20:15] henrysbunter: it would get thrown out because the victim of a crime can't also be an investigating officer
[10:20:17] WarrenPuffit: <message sent to jail for 48 hours>
[10:20:17] Sweet_BabyJeebus: Cornwood is the lawyer

[10:20:21] KanosSmash: KanosSmash subscribed at Tier 1. 
[10:20:23] Waltz_Disney: I think what is going on is you are trying to die on the hill of this charge and everyone else is just trying to rp the deal out.
[10:20:24] JohnieP: @esfandtv It sets a bad precedent. DNA will be practically rendered useless if he isn't charged with possession because then you can't  charge anyone based off their DNA.
[10:20:26] ArdentCause: esfandQuest esfandQuest esfandQuest
[10:20:27] nlwatcher: slacks also said press the charge and agreed youre the expert. He only gave his own opinion on how he interprets the law, but agreed to defer to you
[10:20:33] Perne78: read the possession charge directly from the MDT for us
[10:20:33] dreggy69: mr k confirmed robbed cornwood, confirmed had the glock, glock was confirmed found downstream with mr k's dna confirmed on it. textbook possession. possession doesn't stack with robbery lolol
[10:20:36] dragonesk22: let it be taken to court then after
[10:20:37] 420warlock: dna out of something fully submerged is nonsense.
[10:20:37] Oreo3295: why cant you just say that exact thing in character to them
[10:20:37] kylemacs: Stop trying to gaslight the whole audience bro
[10:20:37] GILx87: K is playing this perfectly and trying to add a sense of urgency
[10:20:37] Perne78: Perne78 subscribed with Prime. 
[10:20:38] Chaoszero_goc: you didnt even catch him with the gun
[10:20:39] jbc_inc: Esfandtv saved my life
[10:20:41] neighborhoodcapricorn: It doesn't matter if it sticks it should be added and then removed if needed
[10:20:44] doggensteinn: they lose in court everytime it feels like
[10:20:46] kylemacs: we get it
[10:20:48] twirlyD: but if u end up agreeing to remove that charge, it wouldn't show up on the report anyway right? so other officers still wouldn't know any better @EsfandTV
[10:20:49] Sandra_D: all they need to do is put in on and let them plead it off
[10:20:49] DaZooKidd420: He is right about the evidence thing though you've had that pallet for awhile now
[10:20:49] DieterK: HDMI
[10:20:49] slomojosh: I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs been articulated to other cops either though. about cutting deals before lawyers
[10:20:50] jinnytolls: DNA on item = Possession
[10:20:50] science_envisions: does the MDT show what charges were dropped
[10:20:52] h8t0r: I think the distinction is: you're right: he HAD possession, via DNA on the gun.... But If I understand, it's not a separate charge: due to the umbrella charge... So it's simply a dielectric. You're both right, but stating the same general thing, two separate ways.
[10:20:53] Wort3xx: Yea but if it does not stick should not be there from the begining
[10:20:54] lawlkat: @EsfandTV serious chat. in character as cornwood you initially explain things poorly. you just disagree, then say "i don't want no bull shit". instead of providing why or the context. until you get frustrated. then you clearly articulate
[10:20:55] Neekapkilla: If it's so important to get things right though, which I can agree with, why try to do everything tonight in a rush and not do a warrant with every single thing clarified?
[10:20:55] tiden5725: I don't understand Slacks, the judge said "textbook"
[10:20:58] Perne78: read the charge in the MDT
[10:20:58] insanealec: He's wrong about DNA not sticking anyway. Body oils have been shown to stick to clothes even after being washed away in a river.
[10:21:00] ZuldeadTV: dude, go for it, you have a judge statement backing you, chat doesn't even play this
[10:21:00] 1manpizza: lookUp vp all those channel points
[10:21:01] FaahQ2: he may be able to plead excessive force. he was running to a river when shot in the back
[10:21:01] DrWetbone: Xavier should be the lawyer for the PD here let him see all the legalese
[10:21:02] BigglesVII: DNA is DNA. There's no reason not to push possession. Let the court decide.
[10:21:02] aniki_math: There's DNA on it.
[10:21:03] Joongi_: xdd
[10:21:05] Leafyerick: Pepega chatters
[10:21:06] heat31: I actually think Cornwood is too revealing during this process. Especially when it comes to saying who he's getting input from. Fundamentally saying 'A Judge' is no different than saying 'Judge Gatsby.'
[10:21:06] DiscretionaI: Take it to the meeting. For now, I recommend getting through the processing phase before it escalates @esfandtv
[10:21:06] mattchutt: he took it off the ground LUL
[10:21:07] jacobtplatt: HIS DNA IS ON THE GUN....

[10:21:08] PaulUnfiltered: esfandPains esfandPains
[10:21:09] maestro__21: It shouldn't have dna if its in water
[10:21:09] ArdentCause: @chaoszero_goc I wonder how his DNA got on it, must have been the water
[10:21:10] devlin0221: THERE IS DNA RETARDS
[10:21:10] EnoStone: chat will be chat LUL dont listen to them
[10:21:11] Berserake: I think Slacks doesnt want to push it because of RP reasons, like the DNA being washed and the gun washing out the car
[10:21:11] Orbilion: Kappa

[10:21:14] Brakon: Water does not magically was off dna like some people think

[10:21:18] timedoggg: The gun was recovered during the same incident. @EsfandTV does that not matter?
[10:21:18] PreciousJenna: Duncaning
[10:21:18] MarvMelody: Duncaning
[10:21:18] DaZooKidd420: That's a extra 100k that you can't do anything about
[10:21:19] widbar: Duncaning
[10:21:20] roshamb09: Lmao
[10:21:20] Connorbrow: @jinnytolls yeah, I think it's because he's so tired but he's been really bad at articulating points in character. Out of character it all makes sense though
[10:21:20] twilightbaseballscene: LUL
[10:21:20] kylef_: Duncaning i don't think you're a bad guy
[10:21:21] maestro__21: It shouldnt be
[10:21:21] lydo00: Slacks is hung up on K not having possession when he was arrested, however Gatsby said that the act of you seeing him pick it up and finding DNA is enough
[10:21:22] KaycasTV: Joel
[10:21:23] 420warlock: you want this gun charge so badddd
[10:21:23] Perne78: taken is robbery.  active possession means it is on your person
[10:21:23] GuyInUniverse: Duncaning
[10:21:24] lda1cuh: don‚Äôt forget to charge him for disorderly conduct, disrupting the peace, being mean to police
[10:21:25] AngryLuigi13: Duncaning
[10:21:25] Neiara__: Bro every criminal can just toss a gun and never be charged when it‚Äôs found now? Lmao
[10:21:25] Raja_Banhammer: BUT WATER WASHES IT OFF UltraMad
[10:21:26] Bojabes: I see what you mean, I think it was just miscommunication at the start of this conversation that got things confusing
[10:21:27] lawlkat: @EsfandTV serious chat. in character as cornwood you initially explain things poorly. you just disagree, then say "i don't want no bull shit". instead of providing why or the context. until you get frustrated. then you clearly articulate

[10:21:35] karaskyee: duncan for HR
[10:21:38] widbar: Duncaning is this inhumane treatment
[10:21:39] insanealec: @Berserake DNA wouldn't necessarily be washed off in the river. It's been shown to stick after being washed.
[10:21:39] salvi9: the DNA proves possession. it‚Äôs not like a ‚Äúoops not on me you can‚Äôt prove it‚Äù like it used to be. DNA proves possession
[10:21:40] GILx87: Duncaning as a reformation specialist is amazing!
[10:21:40] Perne78: read the possession charge in the MDT
[10:21:40] KanosSmash: @EsfandTV Possession implys intention to keep the gun. if they dont have it they didnt keep it
[10:21:41] bb_woo: Lol bad cop good cop himüòÜ
[10:21:41] TheDarkNyet: Mr K picked the gun off of the ground‚Ä¶.. THATS POSSESSION

[10:21:43] ViciousRumor: He obviously slipped and fell on top of the gun, leaving his DNA on it
[10:21:46] dudemanbroo: you are trying to argue your point to Mr.k who wants as few charges as possible. slacks doesn‚Äôt want to add a ton of charges on top because he wants an admission of guilt for the hot gun crimes.
[10:21:47] RyanMcGoose: everyone give your input pls TakingNotes
[10:21:48] SwornHoly: @EsfandTV Slacks is saying it wasn't posession because of rp like he put gun in glovebox and it washed away and there is no dna because of that reason
[10:21:48] kylemacs: is he getting 24 hours either way @esfandtv ? PJSugar PJSugar PJSugar
[10:21:54] 420warlock: which isn‚Äôt helping it‚Äôs adding more charges. he‚Äôs already getting a whole ass day.

[10:22:03] shin5sato3: @EsfandTV I love you man, but sometimes you just aren't good at explaining things and getting your point across
[10:22:05] 360ski: If some throws weed out of thier car and the police recover it, they still get charged for it even though it is not on thier person!

[10:22:27] mmajeter2: has for cornwood even read the kidnapping charge?
[10:22:27] lda1cuh: add it all
[10:22:28] Pee_aRe: Did you forget he asked you for all your stuff so you know he had it at one point regardless
[10:22:29] SkywalkerCush: @EsfandTV it says the word vehicle in the charge look again
[10:22:31] Wynter282: didnt he have spike strips too
[10:22:39] ens0mniac: you speak in generalizations a little too often I think @esfandtv ‚Äúwe got some shit‚Äù instead of ‚Äúwe have evidence of a crime‚Äù and it really hurts the points Cornwood makes
[10:22:39] nekodon1: he did
[10:22:40] slomojosh: WHAT
[10:22:40] RietArtwork: Cornwood would be a good judge for the city
[10:22:41] Connorbrow: @lydo00 yeah,that's the whole point of material evidence and witness statements. It would all be articulatable in court IF they put all their ducks in a row
[10:22:41] 1manpizza: Classic slacks
[10:22:42] mattchutt: how do we not feel comfortable
[10:22:43] warner05: LEAVE DUNCAN IN THE ROOM WITH HIM FOR 30 MINS, HE'LL PLEAD GUILTY LUL @esfandtv

[10:23:23] JayMcMumbles: slacks will blindly follow his captains but wont support his officers when backed by a judge

[10:23:43] energizergeyser: @EsfandTV i have a feeling that they dont understand that he PICKED up your gun and ditched it later honestly its not worth it
[10:23:44] Brick_Brown: i know its just rp but holy moly is mr k annoying
[10:23:44] IKiLele: Slacks should just talk to the judge
[10:23:44] 1CaptainRedBeard1: You're a PPO. Leave it.
[10:23:44] ZuldeadTV: CornWall
[10:23:45] 1manpizza: YEP
[10:23:45] neighborhoodcapricorn: Is Slacks the lead?
[10:23:45] zzzzzzz8133: just say we are pressing the charge we dont need to explain it anymore and thats it
[10:23:45] Koolers_Mobile: You need to remove yourself from this
[10:23:46] 1MILKBOY: YEP
[10:23:46] Phage_Cleaver: Slacks did. He just disagrees with it sticking in court
[10:23:47] likelyhood: Don't go down with the ship
[10:23:47] BattleAlpaca: he literally said we have PC for it but are dropping it
[10:23:47] izzy8501: @esfandtv I'm trying to do some positive hopping because everyone is going crazy right now. Lol. You guys are doing great rp. This is better than Law and Order. Lol. Play Cornwood how you want. It's good rp, plain and simple. <3
[10:23:47] slomojosh: just go patrol at this point
[10:23:49] Jadevor293: Slacks told you he does understand what you're saying
[10:23:49] lepacaJQ: I would just wash my hands of this one LUL
[10:23:50] sevenevilmuffins: "How would DNA get on the gun if he didnt posses it"
[10:23:50] xblasphemye: we have dna and that counts as possession thats why we are pushing it
[10:23:50] Anaximander2099: Yes you gotta let them handle it
[10:23:50] DonnBeach: Yeah sometimes you can't do anything
[10:23:52] phoenixvakarian: Sludge
[10:23:52] DiscretionaI: Let it happen, fix it later in meetings @esfandtv
[10:23:53] StaticEchos: bring it up to Beric later on
[10:23:54] jinnytolls: Yes be very clear, tell the story of what happened. Think of how you write your bullet points in the mdt on reports and how you artticulate what was done to meet the charge @EsfandTV
[10:23:54] warner05: Just walk away and let it be
[10:23:55] decentenuff: @EsfandTV its stressing u out at this point
[10:23:55] tiden5725: Slacks is scard for some reason, bad leadership
[10:23:55] coldan01: kinda pointless at this point
[10:23:56] TimmayHS: I don't understand how a captain could NOT know this stuff
[10:23:56] juanelemichele: You can‚Äôt. you are the victim you are conflicted. A judge will mistrial this.
[10:23:56] Lite_Ice: cant save everyone
[10:23:57] nosticktoaster: Sludge loweeerrrr
[10:23:57] Austin7x3: youve made your case at some point you gotta let them do what they will do
[10:23:57] Craxxbones: You were the victim anyways
[10:23:58] HaZeJgg: @esfandtv finish the report. I don‚Äôt think they fully understand the situation that happened
[10:23:59] marczm4n: gotta pick your battles
[10:24:00] Anaximander2099: especially as the victim
[10:24:00] CptTimberwolf: Sludge
[10:24:00] 420warlock: giving him no reason to tell you shit
[10:24:00] suzibaguzi: he is using his discretion. he understands you but doesn‚Äôt want to press it
[10:24:00] MarvMelody: Sludge
[10:24:01] elchicobranbini: they're gonna think youre overstepping
[10:24:02] TheDarkNyet: if Mr K doesn‚Äôt like the current deal, just slap him with everything
[10:24:02] zeldaspirit: and you‚Äôll be conflicted
[10:24:03] Vikairius: Yeah, go patrol and have fun. esfandL esfandL esfandL
[10:24:03] Joongi_: xdd K
[10:24:03] bb_woo: He don't care what you say or how you say it let his lawyer explain it to himüëçüòé
[10:24:03] Landoram: You sometimes speak to broadly and not in direct examples. Like here you should have explained why possession and robbery both should be charged but instead spoke about charging generally
[10:24:04] 55Hoes: it‚Äôs just RP
[10:24:04] RietArtwork: I have the same problem irl haha
[10:24:06] i_am_jam_: write your statement of what happened
[10:24:07] Clodhoppr: you‚Äôre overthinking it here I feel, K still wants to RP to what he believe will get him the lowest charges which included trying to annoy you enough to get you to leave the room @esfandtv
[10:24:09] devlin0221: https://www.wikihow.com/Explain
[10:24:10] mrburns40: your dna was found on a gun where you fled. you were in possession of said gun.
[10:24:11] purplegion: I think you made everything clear other than the fact you didn't want to punish him more. I think they misunderstood you want to give the charge *then* drop it down, not make it worse @esfandtv
[10:24:11] JasonMunday: Sludge Clap
[10:24:11] kylemacs: oh wait you‚Äôre not even arresting officer??? @esfandtv
[10:24:11] Rivath: We all know you're trying to make it so there isn't scuffed charges in the future
[10:24:12] iwannanuhh: Slacks Speech score is like -50
[10:24:12] khrow: ok
[10:24:13] shr00mz_09: I just think the issue is he's going to push COI against you
[10:24:15] happylagoon1: just go patrol at this point
[10:24:16] Mouso9: Discuss with Beric. See what his opinion of it
[10:24:18] FaahQ2: let K be K, let slacks get the reprimand for it
[10:24:18] EmDuBB13: a sane hopper! Pog
[10:24:19] outlawpickle: make it clear to slacks YOU SAW him pick up your gun, slacks is missing this point, you.  saw him pick it up, and then in combo with DNA it‚Äôs slam dunk
[10:24:20] uneik: idk if its just me or if you do it on purpose but cornwood explains things longer-winded. outside of rp you explain things directly.
[10:24:20] HeyMeghan: it‚Äôs not you. talking to slacks is kind of like talking to a foot as Justin Kidd said lmao
[10:24:23] RedRobo: RedRobo subscribed with Prime. 
[10:24:26] zeldaspirit: You‚Äôll be conflicted. just call a prosecutor
[10:24:27] MrActivated: can't fix everything sadly
[10:24:27] lostmindoce: @EsfandTV Literally just walk out and leave, if they ask why then just say you dont feel you were being listened to
[10:24:32] Chaoszero_goc: slacks is saying no one saw him throw the gun an hes saying it washed out of the car after he robbed it off you
[10:24:33] Kolipto: It almost seems like they got it but also are not taking it the way you were hoping.
[10:24:34] jbc_inc: Does cornwood like falafel???
[10:24:34] Sibrav: just call xavier
[10:24:34] Perne78: read the possession charge from the MDT.  It should tell you exactly
[10:24:34] THE_F0STERCHILD: And also since you are the victim, could be seen as pushing charges maliciously even though you are not
[10:24:35] lda1cuh: thanks for helping k, good man
[10:24:36] deadbyhunting: But lawyer cornwood needs to right the wrongs that he has seen in the city!
[10:24:37] Joongi_: OMEGALUL
[10:24:37] Ross_McD: #characterdevelopment
[10:24:37] Sweet_BabyJeebus: Cornwood is just scared now
[10:24:37] JasonMunday: essaying Clap
[10:24:38] devlin0221: @EsfandTV https://www.wikihow.com/Explain
[10:24:38] deafguy87: my cornwoods growing up FeelsStrongMan
[10:24:39] shin5sato3: @EsfandTV they need to know that you want to get EVERYTHING on the table, so Mr K can see exactly what you are taking off to make the deal
[10:24:39] coppertec: like a recruitment camp, you need a basic law camp
[10:24:41] Blizzard5050: esfandL esfandL esfandL missbo10LOVE missbo10LOVE missbo10LOVE
[10:24:43] icephrogg: tbh no crim cares about a charge that could happened in the future they rather deal with it than and not get a 100,000 charge today
[10:24:43] DarkheroGaming: Idk you explained it really well to me
[10:24:44] FreakTheMedic: it‚Äôs almost playing favorites, it‚Äôs time to drop all the lawful charges you can. just dumb because he deserves the book for robbing a cop @esfandtv nothing you can do about what
[10:24:44] deafguy87: my  cornwoods growing up FeelsStrongMan
[10:24:46] IncognitoOri: talk to Beric about this
[10:24:47] JasonMunday: essaying essaying essaying essaying
[10:24:47] Caml0st: why give up trying to talk to slacks about THIS; this is the justice system breaking into pieces because slacks is just being "nice"
[10:24:48] knowlightnofear: The issue is.......you were only trying to get the charges right....you never once said you weren't trying to deal the charges down
[10:24:48] Anaximander2099: the problem is you're the victim here
[10:24:49] Doqx42: Cornwood negotiation model should be how everyone does it.  Slacks is doing just like you said and doing his own negotiation in his head even after hearing that he was wrong.
[10:24:49] slomojosh: Slacks has shown he‚Äôs not going to listen no matter what. this has to be brought up to Berics attention to get real training  @esfandtv
[10:24:49] Brakon: You just got to keep at it even after this incident
[10:24:52] kylemacs: why are you guys all there if you‚Äôre not the arresting officers??
[10:24:52] 55Hoes: @esfandtv lookin cute today
[10:24:53] Bigeyez: Ssaab understands what you were saying but OOC doesn't feel right pushing it because of how fucked K already is
[10:24:53] bobbybeee: slacks is throwing
[10:24:54] kylef_: essaying
[10:24:54] RedRobo: that's fine...when you're a lawyer. cops apply charges based on evidence and testimony. their lawyer can explain it to them
[10:24:54] Olskipper: you're not going to fix everything in this situation. I think you made your point though
[10:24:55] Anaximander2099: it taints everything
[10:24:55] nekodon1: @esfandTV i
[10:24:56] FaahQ2: hard to say when charging needs to start being corrected tho.
[10:24:57] Vikairius: You try to be to articulate and not direct enough to the point at times. People can't follow always
[10:24:58] Ralios42: mr. k isn't one that cares about what all the charges are he just wants to get to the deal part. I think you explaining the charges is good but just not for everyone.
[10:24:58] ThePositiveBot: [Minigame] AUTOMATIC TRIVIA! PogChamp Question: Name the school that Harry Potter attended? :) (+1 cookie)
[10:24:59] GhostSkull0: @esfandtv trying to keep that balance
[10:25:00] marczm4n: how‚Äôs your neck?
[10:25:00] TimmayHS: Cornwood is gonna lose respect if he doesn't stick to his guns
[10:25:01] soosmaz74: he had the possession of the gun
[10:25:02] 1manpizza: LULE we dont' even know what Mr K is offering and he's tossing stuff out
[10:25:03] PreciousJenna: Slacks does what he wants
[10:25:03] Connorbrow: SET UP THE BLOODY MOCK CASES ALREADY SO JUDGES CAN CORRECT THIS STUFF
[10:25:04] cocokitty: yes but ppl want to be undercharged and work down from there
[10:25:05] coldan01: time to move on i guess
[10:25:06] nekodon1: i would call in another lawyer
[10:25:06] manamajeeff: yo slacks DonoWall
[10:25:06] ShaftGiraffe: Figure out charges THEN talk to the suspect. Do not mention charges before you finished gathering evidcence
[10:25:07] tiden5725: It's crazy Slacks doesn't want to push it
[10:25:08] yeti_91: idk bro Mr K gets himself into these charges lol
[10:25:08] dholdren12: dholdren12 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[10:25:09] xblasphemye: @slomojosh I actually agree 1 billion percent
[10:25:12] kylemacs: I wouldn‚Äôt stress on it
[10:25:13] time4sleep: THEY ARE LITERALLY CONFUSED ABOUT SLACKS CHARGING HAPPENING RIGHT NOW
[10:25:14] SMFTwistedSMF: Well, Yeah. I think at this level now. You see it. We see it. Seems like they just dont give a shit. lol
[10:25:15] shr00mz_09: I think he's just gonna push COI against you.
[10:25:16] 360ski: You are doing it the correct way
[10:25:17] Ganelon: When you are officially PRO maybe push forward classes on pushing charges and just use this as one example to push that charge.
[10:25:17] everyone1980: cornwood character progression right?
[10:25:22] shreddemm: you threw the gun on the ground and watched him pick it up when he first held you up. this whole thing couldve been avoided
[10:25:23] ZuldeadTV: sometimes the team just can't be carried all the way, gotta let'em throw
[10:25:24] Hellkite1534: Trying to turn Reno 911 into a documentary
[10:25:24] dholdren12: it is what is you win some you lose some
[10:25:25] jinnytolls: You can possess a pd gun without robbing a gov employee and you can also rob a gov employee without taking their gun. DNA on item = possession
[10:25:25] Vikairius: Slacks cares about the hot gun more than cornwood
[10:25:26] Rivath: Crims might think they can toss weapons again and not get charged but they 100% will
[10:25:26] chiggles18: @EsfandTV How they hell can you stream this long and still be clear and level headed? I can barely function at my job of 8 hours lol. Keep up the great rp.
[10:25:27] Perne78: but do you know it?  read the actual charge
[10:25:29] revenueprofit: he DOES know that, he mentioned knowing it. He just wants to make a deal @EsfandTV
[10:25:29] LHaxorP: I think that process you want to happen makes sense but it needs to be talked about before something happens cause people dont want to ahve the disscusion during an active situation
[10:25:30] ComradeGreetingCard: you're not but slacks is
[10:25:30] kheg_: SLACKS IS BRAINDEAD
[10:25:31] jaybobuk: I think you repeated things too much and it got circled.. with this said YOU ARE RIGHT with what you did
[10:25:32] crescenterra: you're not
[10:25:33] ArdentCause: this is great RP but when it gets to technical it doesn‚Äôt sound fun lol
[10:25:33] Ross_McD: I said this in the first couple weeks watching Cornwood learn and adapt has been a great overarching plot line
[10:25:33] CptTimberwolf: You aren't
[10:25:33] TimmayHS: PD needs mandatory training on situations like this, especially for captains @EsfandTV
[10:25:33] outlawpickle: I don‚Äôt think slacks understands that you 100% saw him pick up your gun after you dropped it
[10:25:33] DiscretionaI: Create a notepad, write the issue down, fix it later @esfandtv
[10:25:34] warner05: PLAY STUPID GAMES GET STUPID PRIZES
[10:25:34] nekodon1: your fine but there going light on him
[10:25:36] Raja_Banhammer: i think you're right esfand
[10:25:37] nimbleop: Slacks isn't listening to you
[10:25:37] SmugPls: just dont break the law YEP
[10:25:38] kylemacs: YOURE TRYING TO WIN A BATTLE THAT ISNT YOURS TO WIN MAN
[10:25:38] BigglesVII: Yeah to be fair you are a victim in this case, you shouldnt be involved beyond arresting and writing your statement.
[10:25:40] h0lk1: don‚Äôt steal a cop Gun if you don‚Äôt want to accept the charge lol
[10:25:40] aniki_math: You're doing great. you'Re getting gaslit so hard
[10:25:40] Ralios42: you're not.
[10:25:40] marczm4n: it‚Äôs not a bad job, it‚Äôs just incorrect
[10:25:41] khrow: HE SAID HE KNOWS
[10:25:42] RyanMcGoose: some people got the tato brain.
[10:25:43] Sweet_BabyJeebus: exactly but too soft with Slacks
[10:25:44] shr00mz_09: nah you're doing a great job buddy.
[10:25:44] Vikairius: Literally only cares about this hot gun
[10:25:44] neighborhoodcapricorn: I think you should clarify whether you just want it added or also pushed
[10:25:45] emery_steele: DonoWall slacks
[10:25:46] DieterK: stop reading chat so much
[10:25:46] Doqx42: Only issue with the explaining is the Cornwood backstory each time :)
[10:25:47] iwannanuhh: Youre not, Slacks has been derailed from the start of this
[10:25:47] jinnytolls: Ask them what you arent articulating if they get your point? @EsfandTV
[10:25:47] phoenixvakarian: he told you to throw the gun and then picked it up. even if there was no DNA it's still a charge isn't it?
[10:25:47] tiden5725: Maybe Slacks is a bad listener
[10:25:48] imp_eria: LAWFUL lawful good
[10:25:48] Pee_aRe: Yes but regardless you was the victim you have no say on what is being charged and shouldnt have any content with the suspect regardless what you think
[10:25:51] Ragestrike: i think you explained it 20 times. now i dont know why you keep explaining it.
[10:25:51] Helemok: I think the problem here is you got to do this before you talk to the suspect and not in front of the suspect @esfandtv
[10:25:53] Bamisaur: Justice the Long Way
[10:25:53] 360ski: You are doing it perfect, it's not the explanation,  it thier listening
[10:25:54] TheDarkNyet: you are doing a great job. slacks is being manipulated to be soft because K is working his magic
[10:25:54] CptTimberwolf: Slacks just doesn't get it Loading
[10:25:56] thewarth0g: done all you can
[10:25:57] DrWetbone: not every situation deserves charge dropping to get a guilty plea, sometimes you just go to court and let the judge decide
[10:25:57] The_Strix01: You are doing a good job, i dont think they understand.
[10:25:57] thysiastery: literally need to talk to beric about his listening problem LOL
[10:25:58] Thebreadlord: You‚Äôre explaining it perfectly @esfandtv
[10:25:58] RexPappa: Well you're explaining this to Slacks, thats an issue too.
[10:25:58] yaboygrumbles: You‚Äôre doing fine but Slacks kind of railroading this a different direction
[10:25:58] Phage_Cleaver: @EsfandTV I think they understand. They just disagree
[10:25:59] HoeTown: Slacks wasn't listening to what you're saying, he was trying to set up the deal before setting all the charges
[10:25:59] coldan01: @DieterK, he cant really help it
[10:26:00] xblasphemye: youre not just be confident
[10:26:00] 1manpizza: I think they both know, they just want to do something different 4Shrug
[10:26:00] Shmoopee: Idk what you're explaining. but. your probably are explaining things badly. it's an Esfand trait Okayge
[10:26:00] Grilbur: Pretty sure slacks is trying to keep k on the server
[10:26:01] soosmaz74: @marczm4n how is it incorrect
[10:26:01] ArdentCause: Slacks is using officer discretion
[10:26:01] afghanpsycho: @ssaab just wants to occ drop the charge, its just bullshit
[10:26:02] heartsonlysoren: I don't fully understand why you aernt dumping his phone records and going after accomplices
[10:26:04] Berserake: Slakcs is doing a bad job at explaining that because of RP reasons he doesnt think it should be pushed and now theyre learning to not push it
[10:26:04] papadooskie: they need to know what charges apply regardless of what yall go through with
[10:26:04] jbc_inc: Cornwood is THE falafel gobbler
[10:26:04] BattleAlpaca: you did your job you made your point the people who you want to understand (K and other cops) understand and get it. talk to slacks after
[10:26:04] ItsRickyGG: the voice of reason
[10:26:05] destrophic: destrophic subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months! ofdO7
[10:26:06] Ragestrike: if people dont get it at this point then just ignore them
[10:26:07] renegade93_: Like a Paladin in a way? :D @esfandtv
[10:26:08] shindov: charge him who cares its gta
[10:26:09] Perne78: in RL active possession requires it to be on your person.  Constructive possession requires you to prove the individual has access to it
[10:26:09] Luthonen: You're yapping to much and not going directly to the point
[10:26:11] silver_ash: you keep being too cryptic instead of giving concrete examples when trying to explain stuff to them
[10:26:11] Bigeyez: @esfandtv he knows. He understands. He doesn't want to push the charge for OOC reasons because he feels K is already fucked
[10:26:13] benjaminyo_: Slacks is just doing a bad job at pressing charges LUL
[10:26:13] nlwatcher: i think the argument just went on too long with the streaming sitting alone in a chair in the other room
[10:26:13] ululululu1u: Didn't Slacks just tell they can charge with possession charge ttho? If slacks adds the charge K will not cooperate so
[10:26:14] ShaftGiraffe: !. conduct investigation 2. Decide on  charges 3. present all charges to suspect 4. THEN you can deal
[10:26:14] NefariousGoat: Your method is the right one because it can fail in court and then you learn from it. There's no information to gain from slacks method, he opts out from potentially failing.
[10:26:14] 360ski: Based
[10:26:15] kylemacs: How?
[10:26:16] sevenevilmuffins: ask them how would DNA get on the gun if he did not posses it
[10:26:16] Chaoszero_goc: no one saw him throw it
[10:26:17] k9_goliath: I feel like sometimes Slacks just doesn't want alot of cooks in his RP kitchen
[10:26:17] dholdren12: oh well he is the captain
[10:26:17] Kolipto: I think they got it, but they are not acting in a way that shows they share the same serious value.
[10:26:18] soosmaz74: BASED
[10:26:19] nekodon1: He wasn't a fellon any more
[10:26:19] TimmayHS: I feel bad for the PPO that is 100% right who is now watching a captain fuck it up
[10:26:20] tiden5725: that's a good point, even the other cops are wtf
[10:26:20] timedoggg: The gun was recovered during the same incident. I think the robbery charge cover it @EsfandTV
[10:26:20] nosticktoaster: Sludge
[10:26:21] 55Hoes: Slacks is aware
[10:26:21] time4sleep: YEP
[10:26:22] twilightbaseballscene: dap him for it
[10:26:22] SavageTarzan: Aware
[10:26:22] HoeTown: yes absolutely
[10:26:22] vmjama: Does Slacks understand that Mr. K picked up the gun? He thinks you put the gun in the glove box.
[10:26:23] IckyStickyG00: Not the best precedent
[10:26:23] kylemacs: He‚Äôs aware!
[10:26:24] emery_steele: you need to lay it all on the table first, then break it down
[10:26:24] JoeSizzle7: You don't HAVE to
[10:26:24] Zeph_202: @EsfandTV assuming Cornwoo is lawful good, in a situation where lawful conflicts with good which would he choose?
[10:26:25] yaboygrumbles: Yep
[10:26:25] Murrig: @Luthonen mhm
[10:26:25] Miterex: Miterex subscribed with Prime. 
[10:26:25] h0lk1: I love that all crims do some stupid shit then act surprised when they get charges
[10:26:27] bobbybeee: THEN YOU NEED TO STEP IN
[10:26:27] RexPappa: DAP HIM
[10:26:28] BigglesVII: Yep 100% too early
[10:26:28] 360ski: True story
[10:26:29] kylemacs: you told him 20 times
[10:26:29] goochtickler7000: youre just long winded and never seem to get to the point
[10:26:30] bennnnboy49: he was called cg baas for a reason
[10:26:32] aaronalford24: but that‚Äôs just your opinion
[10:26:32] xblasphemye: i think you just need to be more confident to be honest and press slacks or whoever disagrees a little more. or you need to have slacks questioned by beric'd
[10:26:32] jinnytolls: You can possess a pd gun without robbing a gov employee and you can also rob a gov employee without taking their gun. DNA on item = possession @EsfandTV
[10:26:32] Spartoriius: speak up to slacks
[10:26:33] CptTimberwolf: KEKW
[10:26:33] Greyconnor: Slacks just doesn
[10:26:33] burlin_: it's a deal, no point in taking it off at the very beginning
[10:26:34] lostmindoce: What are you guys not getting? Its SO simple...
[10:26:34] Clodhoppr: @esfandtv brother you‚Äôre good, K is trying to push you out of the room intentionally so he can try to get a better deal based on what he believe in RP, K knows and won‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre trying to help out with teaching officers
[10:26:35] scopedin07: @esfandtv I feel like the officers need to always start with all charges at the beginning and the pull back
[10:26:36] ScoutRacing: CHARGES SAHOULD BE DROPPED IN COURT
[10:26:37] warner05: "I'm a Felon, I cant work".  Who's fault is that K???
[10:26:37] lostmindoce: SEE
[10:26:37] BattleAlpaca: slacks opened with we have PC for possession but are not doing it @EsfandTV
[10:26:37] Leafyerick: It's annoying how much K gets away with and when he gets caught people freak out
[10:26:41] touchpaduser5678: you want the charges to be exact‚Ä¶ they are going to low‚Ä¶ cornwood likes to be exact and then pull the charges down
[10:26:42] Shmoopee: oh! Ruby made this mistake with Oz and it frustrated Oz.
[10:26:42] Phage_Cleaver: You dont make deals before all the stuff is laid on the table
[10:26:42] Gusty331: He's your captain gotta have his back
[10:26:42] sleepgoat: HOW YOU JUST EXPLAINED IT RN IS PERFECT. CALL SLACKS BACK IN
[10:26:43] RedRobo: LEOs just assign the charges. his legal council can explain them to him if he needs it. and there's no need to bargain with him
[10:26:44] science_envisions: at this point why are they still giving him leway, he is not cooperating?
[10:26:44] Koolers_Mobile: You just being apart of this is not in good faith of the law.
[10:26:44] arizonaowl: UNLEASH THE PLEBS
[10:26:45] Vikairius: Might need to talk to beric about procedure @esfandtv
[10:26:45] Raja_Banhammer: TOOBASED BAY-ZED
[10:26:46] suzibaguzi: Mr k is aware though
[10:26:47] xblasphemye: this needs to be a conversation with slacks and the cheif
[10:26:48] SmugPls: does k just think he was gunna be clean forever LUL he was doing crime before his first charge
[10:26:48] TimmayHS: EXACTLY
[10:26:49] dreggy69: slacks got his order of operations all messed up lolol
[10:26:49] Connorbrow: Slacks was saying he doesn't think the charge will stick but that doesn't matter at that point
[10:26:50] HoeTown: Slacks is skipping steps, yes
[10:26:50] IWezzerI: Then take slacks out
[10:26:52] maxmolly: I couldn‚Äôt RP i would just give em the 9 and not listen to the crims talk in circles KEKW
[10:26:54] GorSTL: Slacks took it off tho
[10:26:54] RyanMcGoose: "now im stupid" its becoming self aware <3
[10:26:54] twilightbaseballscene: slacks is throwing plain and simple
[10:26:55] bb_woo: Because slacks is scared to make me k mad lol üòÖ
[10:26:55] Greyconnor: Slacks just doesn't want to deal with a whiny baby
[10:26:55] AShadowOfDarkness: METAWOOD the victim, trying to lead the investigation behind a scuffed server issue. Classic.
[10:26:55] papadooskie: see now they're doubting themselves
[10:26:55] emery_steele: exactly cornwoods point
[10:26:56] Trolltex87: Would the extra DNA on the weapon be Frosts DNA since she picked it up?
[10:26:56] Perne78: constructive possession might but active possession would not
[10:26:56] spongefrank: at the same time, Mr. K argue on all charge, he doesn't have time to lay down everything
[10:26:57] JoeSizzle7: Cops generally don't tell everyone about extra charges they aren't getting
[10:27:02] jurassicori: I like watching your stream @EsfandTV
[10:27:02] BattleAlpaca: slacks just opened with we have PC for possession but are not doing it @EsfandTV
[10:27:02] nekodon1: Pull slacks out and stop him from being a idot
[10:27:02] STUNNER310: You should present the charge. You can make a deal to drop it after. Slacks doesn‚Äôt think it would stick for whatever reason so that‚Äôs why he won‚Äôt charge the gun. Seems like he wants to move the RP along.
[10:27:03] iwannanuhh: Slacks needs to go back to training
[10:27:04] deafguy87: finally they see OMEGALAUGHING
[10:27:04] Rivath: They get it
[10:27:04] 1manpizza: Duncan report Slacks to Beric Tomfoolery
[10:27:04] time4sleep: YEP Û†ÄÄ
[10:27:04] SumDee_LumDee: TAKE A NAP
[10:27:04] soosmaz74: based
[10:27:06] jbc_inc: Everyone just needs to eat some falafel and everything would be fine
[10:27:06] kylemacs: oh no  don‚Äôt  start badmouthing the captain who had your back
[10:27:07] deafguy87: finally  they see OMEGALAUGHING
[10:27:07] nosnese476: isn't the guy who plays slacks trying to get him demoted? is this him trying to rp slacks messing  up
[10:27:07] ZuldeadTV: she got chat mind for a second there OMEGALAUGHING
[10:27:09] Potato_Nation19: @EsfandTV  Slacks kep saying you were "pushing" the charge, and you werent, it just needed to be on there, then you can widdle down, I dont get how they dont get it
[10:27:10] RietArtwork: I like it more when the night is not so serious Sadge
[10:27:11] SMFTwistedSMF: Kroger is going through that now with a Union contract. They give you a shit contract, See if you hold your guns and go on strike and then offer a better one. lol
[10:27:12] Leafyerick: YEP guilty as sin
[10:27:13] ens0mniac: yeah both Mr K and Slacks said they understand your point, at this point just walk away and talk to Slacks and Beric after @esfandtv
[10:27:14] DaZooKidd420: If it was just this situation then yeah but he's already fucked regardless
[10:27:15] ArdentCause: it sounds like they care more about the shooting of the 2 government employees more than the actual gun
[10:27:16] Sweet_BabyJeebus: gotta press Slacks together
[10:27:16] TimmayHS: this is embarrassing for slacks tbh
[10:27:17] deadbyhunting: This is causing doubts in the newer officers now
[10:27:17] nimbleop: DAP clsacks
[10:27:18] CptTimberwolf: KEKW They finally get it
[10:27:18] Thebreadlord: Call Xavier
[10:27:19] bobbybeee: corruption smells funky
[10:27:20] heartsonlysoren: you are the arresting officer charge him as you like
[10:27:20] yaboygrumbles: Him skipping the step and K trying to get to dropping charges before everything has been articulated is confusing bc the table was never set fully
[10:27:21] MarvMelody: Duncaning lemme cook
[10:27:21] TheDarkNyet: there ya go, your fellow officers agree with you
[10:27:22] timtheboneman: Slacks completely understands you, and your point. He just thinks its harsh to stack it all and at some point you have to listen to your captain, even when you're right.
[10:27:22] Julian_______: Chatting
[10:27:23] jokerm21: it‚Äôs because you took too much time to get all the charges in order and you were focused on the menu and they were already on to making a deal!!!
[10:27:23] nosticktoaster: Duncaning let me cook
[10:27:24] Perne78: does the MDT have a constructive possession vs active possession?
[10:27:25] xblasphemye: gaslighting to perfection
[10:27:26] yourdadow: guys cornwood doesnt want to charge him he just wants him to know all the charges that would apply and stick even in court
[10:27:26] shr00mz_09: why don't you ask for a moment alone and go bad cop
[10:27:28] JayMcMumbles: you have to show them what they could face before you cut it down you cant just start at the bottom ... negotiation 101
[10:27:29] imataka12: essaying Û†ÄÄ
[10:27:29] TarvusPlz: in real time you have cops exhibitting the confusion you explained would happen lol
[10:27:30] thewarth0g: time to tell the cheif
[10:27:31] walkgleesh: i think slacks is thinking  in how this will play out in rp to not repeat  a donald bush like situation
[10:27:32] soosmaz74: we really need xavier here
[10:27:33] ArdentCause: that‚Äôs why it feels like he‚Äôs throwing out the PD Glock charge
[10:27:33] Shmoopee: Osvaldo? was it? Ruby gave him the last step of processing rather than the full menu and Osvaldo got frustrated.
[10:27:34] neighborhoodcapricorn: Talk to Beric and get an SOP for this process
[10:27:34] CptTimberwolf: And THIS is what you were trying to avoid
[10:27:35] jbc_inc: Have you considered falafel?
[10:27:36] xblasphemye: exactly, its 100 percent should be on the table
[10:27:37] shin5sato3: @EsfandTV time to bring this up the chain of command and talk to Chief Beric
[10:27:38] sanguinuse: creating bad precedent, second he took the gun he was in possession regardless of what he did with it
[10:27:42] sanguinuse: sanguinuse subscribed with Prime. 
[10:27:42] Map_Of_Your_Head: darn..
[10:27:42] dholdren12: he knows that he is focusin on the biggest charges he can do right now he is trying to get him to talk let him cook if it works it works if not its a learning experience
[10:27:42] VincentsDeath: i think she might not know there is 2 guns, the PD gun and the HOT gun
[10:27:42] Sairaph117: Itw ould be nice to actually hear the interrogation.
[10:27:44] Deathwound: Mr K literally said he wouldn't try to take this scenario apply it later. That he's not stupid.  You just didn't hear it or somehing
[10:27:45] LHaxorP: yea its just too late now since he already omitted charges... to do that so its moot now... neeeds to disscussed for a meeting... ot maybe even get Law gang and some judges together with slacks/beric and whoever
[10:27:48] i_am_jam_: write your statement @esfandtv
[10:27:50] KaycasTV: GETALIFE GIVE EM THE NINES
[10:27:52] Sweet_BabyJeebus: @EsfandTV just ask Slacks in front of everyone. he said it's a learning opportunity
[10:27:53] Miterex: Treat people like they are 5 when explaining things I guess. You're right for pushing this way of learning
[10:27:54] CptTimberwolf: New officers unsure of how to apply the law
[10:27:55] zellitan: @AShadowOfDarkness its not scuff that isnt a PD office that is functioning
[10:27:56] tiden5725: honestly I think Slacks is just scared and not listening
[10:27:58] RedRobo: crime has consequences??? WhaT
[10:27:59] TimmayHS: Yea, I would 100% take some notes and talk to Beric about it
[10:28:00] Berserake: You do sanitation and he robs himself
[10:28:01] TheWardenBoi: What the hell is happening? LUL
[10:28:01] AnnoyedWithChat: Honestly the cops need to watch The First 48, goes through this whole thing much better lol
[10:28:02] scopedin07: talk to slacks about not putting all the charges at the beginning
[10:28:02] warner05: OH IM A FELON, ITS YALLS FAULT I CANT GET A JOB @esfandtv
[10:28:03] bb_woo: You can't bust the kingpin or he looks like a regular goon lol üëçüòé
[10:28:04] jinnytolls: Its not too late; they havent charged him. They can still discover charges
[10:28:06] Morrtein: Morrtein subscribed with Prime. 
[10:28:06] SmugPls: He wont get robbed if he does sanitation because he does the robbing YEP

[10:28:39] jinnytolls: Ask them what you arent articulating if they get your point in character @EsfandTV
[10:28:39] CuIdra: @esfandtv everyone knows Declan is the main character
[10:28:40] vmjama: @sanguinuse yeah thats the issue. Every time, crims will throw away the gun when about to get cuffed, and argue this precedence.
[10:28:41] SXR9: the only reason he even took the gun was to make sure cornwood didnt shoot him. possession on top of robbery seems excessive
[10:28:41] Gahbij: @devlin0221 it already is MAAAAN
[10:28:42] supaiiii: main bozo syndrome RIPBOZO
[10:28:42] xblasphemye: crim chatter ripbozo

[10:28:46] 360ski: But technically you shouldn't be involved with this since you were the officer involved in this
[10:28:46] RexPappa: Dude my take is to let Slacks do what hes doing, then after try to talk your POV in a more relaxed environment
[10:28:47] ZuldeadTV: it's already sub only they're losing 10k to speak stupid shit

[10:28:50] Ragestrike: just close chat at this point
[10:28:50] DavidGavin55: this seems like a standard point where cornwood wants to avoid contention in court, regardless if this charge is dropped he just wants to make sure that it can be apart of this later for now and later. crims may not see it but it‚Äôs the lasting effect it has on the present and future

[10:29:48] 55Hoes: Frost will learn one day
[10:29:49] time4sleep: YEP PD needs to lead with: "Based on the evidence we have, you COULD be charged with the following...." and THEN you talk it down
[10:29:50] burlin_: Slacks sucks at this
[10:29:51] Miterex: Treat people like they are 5 when explaining things I guess. You're right for pushing this way of learning. 'If it isn't the consequences of my actions~'
[10:29:51] 420warlock: YOU USED DISCRETION WITH ABILENE
[10:29:52] 360ski: Don't do crime!
[10:29:53] jinnytolls: He shouldnt do the heavy crimes then
[10:29:55] mattchutt: slacks is so soft lol
[10:29:56] soosmaz74: @xblasphemye he is more than guilty
[10:29:56] RedRobo: officer discretion is usually for a reason usually pursuant to an investigation. there's no reason here
[10:29:57] coldan01: mr k did nothing wrong Kapp
[10:29:57] SmugPls: @UA_Shark Fredo has like -200k in the bank and hes living life YEP
[10:29:58] ZuldeadTV: Slacks throwing ICANT
[10:29:59] devlin0221: @Gahbij Kind of an over site on Twitchs side
[10:30:01] jbc_inc: A falafel a day keeps the crime away
[10:30:01] jokerm21: I understand you are trying to get the whole menu together and then present in and drop what charges but it was taking to long IN FRONT of Mr. K
[10:30:04] Wallsh_: slacks = soft
[10:30:04] DiscretionaI: PC/RS/RAS = Press Charge approved
[10:30:05] Morrkills: Mr K, such a cry baby...he's a crim...take the charges like a boss..if you're a boss.
[10:30:07] TheDarkNyet: NO WAY the robbery charge gets dropped LOL
[10:30:07] heartsonlysoren: charge everything
[10:30:08] iwannanuhh: Duncan got dapped from dropping a Felony im pretty sure... kinda shitty that a captain does it infront of him XD
[10:30:08] Mouso9: Slacks has dapped Duncan for dropping a felony charge lol
[10:30:08] 420warlock: LITERALLY A PD GUN CHARGE WAS DROPPED
[10:30:09] marczm4n: exactly
[10:30:10] FaahQ2: Flop used discretion
[10:30:10] geo_logic_: its to keep people from robbing cops, thats why its so high
[10:30:11] soosmaz74: what is this he is negotiating his  crims LUL
[10:30:11] bobbybeee: I wish beric was here
[10:30:11] Pitch__Black: I'd drop the gun charge anyway for Gatsbys safety
[10:30:11] Kolipto: I think the intent was not to steal it from the way Slacks and MR K are interoperating/framing it.
[10:30:12] warner05: Omg such BS
[10:30:12] mattchutt: this shouldnt be bending me but it is LUL
[10:30:15] ArdentCause: if you can‚Äôt do the time then don‚Äôt do the crime especially 5 different ones üòÇ
[10:30:15] xblasphemye: @soosmaz74 lol the sarcasm didnt come through huh
[10:30:16] heartsonlysoren: thats a lie, he took them out
[10:30:17] 420warlock: PICK AND CHOOSE PD JESUS
[10:30:18] zeldaspirit: the vehicle
[10:30:18] Caml0st: let him trade 1440 months for 100k pd charge :)
[10:30:19] kylemacs: why are we treating this like a win versus loss situation @esfandtv
[10:30:22] shreddemm: you didnt put the gun in the glovebox, you threw it on the ground
[10:30:22] TimmayHS: Slacks doesn't know what possession means
[10:30:23] tripointe_: I think the problem was that the charges were discussed in front of Mr. K. The PD should have discussed the menu first then presented it
[10:30:24] Wynter282: but he stole the car
[10:30:24] BigglesVII: Problem dropping that charge is its not going to deter crims from stealing cop guns.
[10:30:25] marczm4n: that‚Äôs why it won‚Äôt stick
[10:30:27] jinnytolls: Didnt attempt
[10:30:28] soosmaz74: @xblasphemye LUL MY BAD
[10:30:28] ZuldeadTV: this is why you throw everything you have, you can't start the deal taking things off first
[10:30:31] Rivath: yeah he's applying the logic of slacks
[10:30:32] buuutty: Duncan nearly got in trouble for dropping a g6 money charge
[10:30:33] esuardi: Ssaab too nice
[10:30:34] happylagoon1: write your statement @esfandtv
[10:30:34] badperson1234: slacks needs to go be a lawyer esfandHappy
[10:30:35] Zazun_: lol the gun didnt stay in the the car lol
[10:30:36] xblasphemye: no they didnt because of the DNA
[10:30:38] slomojosh: this is why slacks is always behind the 8 ball
[10:30:38] sanguinuse: no he's not the second he removed it from you he was in possesion of it
[10:30:40] Berserake: Didnt give him possession and now hes arguing down and already dropped set of charges
[10:30:44] juanelemichele: If cornwood processes this it might get thrown out in appeal, he‚Äôs the victim.
[10:30:46] dholdren12: he told him the charge already
[10:30:46] touchpaduser5678: that‚Äôs why you charge him with the possession of the gun, then he can‚Äôt do this bullshit
[10:30:46] Grilbur: This is almost purely slacks just trying to keep k in the server because he knows he's on the edge of leaving
[10:30:46] xblasphemye: thats exactly right without DNA you cant prove robbery
[10:30:47] CptTimberwolf: Slacks is getting walked all over by Mr K right nwo
[10:30:48] TheWardenBoi: I still have no clue what's happening LUL
[10:30:49] Perne78: the only reason his DNA was on the gun is because you didn't put it in the glove box like he asked, you put it on the ground
[10:30:50] Wundrbaa: It's carrot and the stick without the stick
[10:30:50] marczm4n: fair enough
[10:30:50] Map_Of_Your_Head: FailFish jesus
[10:30:53] papadooskie: that's not even the point though! it doesn't matter if it would stick (even though it would)
[10:30:54] heartsonlysoren: go to court please! Charge him fully please!
[10:30:55] FreakTheMedic: -1 pardon, held of gun point shits so solid
[10:30:55] dapyman: K taking control of the items is what matters
[10:30:56] csteele2020: he‚Äôs not making a good argument. he had you put everything but your taser on the ground and picked them up
[10:30:56] Shmoopee: Make them aware of all the wrong doing. And then talk it down from there
[10:30:56] xblasphemye: With the DNA you can prove robbery
[10:30:59] TimmayHS: Slacks actually thinks K is going to tell some kind of useful story
[10:31:00] ens0mniac: slacks is soft tbh, Mr K hasn‚Äôt given up any information at all and slacks just keeps dropping charges lol @esfandtv
[10:31:00] bb_woo: Show all the real charges quit trying to go easy on him lol üòÜ
[10:31:03] CptTimberwolf: Exactly what you wanted to avoid
[10:31:03] ZuldeadTV: SEE, haven't shaved off anything OMEGALAUGHING
[10:31:04] incendiesproductions: I'm so frustrated at seeing Slacks let K walk all over him like this
[10:31:06] PrettyKrazy: maybe slacks wants it to go to court to fail and set precedence ?
[10:31:07] jbc_inc: It's the falafel and the stick
[10:31:07] yaboygrumbles: The gun was already gone from glovebox when you placed taser I thought so what‚Äôs he saying it‚Äôs all in vehicle
[10:31:07] burlin_: slacks getting mind controlled into letting K walk
[10:31:11] marczm4n: he didn‚Äôt steal it
[10:31:13] emery_steele: DinkDonk eat
[10:31:13] science_envisions: so tell him everything and asking what he oesn't want?
[10:31:13] CptTimberwolf: EXACTLY
[10:31:13] 1manpizza: Evilge Mr K gonna walk outta here somehow owning Slack's car
[10:31:13] xblasphemye: GIVE HIM EVERYTHING THEN
[10:31:14] shr00mz_09: don't get too stressed about it. But maybe in a calm  manner afterwards you bring up your concerns. Since you can do that now with no repercussions.

[10:31:53] Joongi_: She's right in everything but this is NoPixel LULE
[10:31:54] FreakTheMedic: ocean dump k at this point it‚Äôll be easier
[10:31:54] Koolers_Mobile: What bothers me is the fact that cornwood knows he is conflicted in being the victim and he should not be talking in this at all.
[10:31:54] silver_ash: why even drop any charges tho, he hasn't even given you any actual information LUL
[10:31:55] Maz0hyst: DinkDonk PROMOTE HER DinkDonk MAKE HER ASSISTANT CHIEF DinkDonk GIVE HER A BONUS
[10:31:57] x_juiceman: Bay would‚Äôve had this shit wrapped up an hour ago LUL
[10:31:58] 420warlock: not even you but the whole pd
[10:32:00] iwannanuhh: Duncan needs to take over, this is a shitshow
[10:32:00] badperson1234: he asked for his tazer into the glovebox @Perne78
[10:32:00] Mastodonian: Can't he rp with carmine and Bobby at prison all day PogU
[10:32:00] jinnytolls: You can possess a pd gun without robbing a gov employee and you can also rob a gov employee without taking their gun. DNA on item = possession
[10:32:02] AFellowDegen: Bay needa replace slacks fr
[10:32:04] kylef_: this is a SHITSHOW

[10:32:07] RossTheBoss__: How long ago did this incident start chat so I can go back in VoD to watch
[10:32:07] Kolipto: If they ask what what the intent of what they would do with the vehicle, that might solve the PD Firearm thing.
[10:32:07] Greyconnor: Just stop negotiating, why can a criminal demand charges dropped? Slacks just doesn't wanna deal with it
[10:32:07] Pitch__Black: @esfandtv I'd drop the gun charge for Gatsbys safety anyway so its ok
[10:32:08] condor2104: Slacks just trying to fry bigger fish by getting more info I think
[10:32:10] Morrkills: NOT META...but i bet he's buying time here for his crew to do work. tying up all these cops lol
[10:32:11] hooey91: slacks needs to end it and charge him with what hes been aware of, hes not wanting to comply anymore..take it to court
[10:32:12] ens0mniac: slacks is terrible at this part of the job lol
[10:32:15] mcknizzle90: Slacks needs to just ship him off
[10:32:16] soosmaz74: slacks is cutting too much slacks
[10:32:16] deadbyhunting: This is gonna end up with K convincing Slacks to dap himself and letting him walk
[10:32:17] thespicymeat_: slacks is actually doing so bad in this "negotiation"
[10:32:17] TimmayHS: Slacks and some others need additional training on the law
[10:32:19] The_Strix01: Wheres Xavier?
[10:32:20] Brakon: @EsfandTV you should keep at it even tho its not your job outside of this situation that is
[10:32:21] JayMcMumbles: 2 things... one you have to start from the max and negotiate down dont start from the middle .. 2 slacks will blindly follow his capts but wont support his officer when supported by a judge
[10:32:21] jaaayteeeh: slacks is overcooking lol
[10:32:23] xblasphemye: wtf PPD putting the female cat in the PPPD
[10:32:23] Mouso9: Why bargaining?  He is giving you nothing and slacks keeps getting softer...    you should talk to berric about this
[10:32:23] LHaxorP: We need Law gang and judge gang do discuss and hold a seminar liek once or twice a month
[10:32:30] k9_goliath: Is there a charge for Aggravated Interrogation? Cheer100
[10:32:30] DrWetbone: if you want to make the criminals happy with PD interactions NEVER catch them, anything else feels like a loss for them
[10:32:30] 420warlock: you were taking your gun back and forth anyway
[10:32:31] happylagoon1: write your statement @esfandtv
[10:32:32] heartsonlysoren: Slacks is negotiating aginst himself for some reason
[10:32:32] Sweet_BabyJeebus: Beric gave you a job. mix that with this? @EsfandTV
[10:32:34] FaahQ2: this is my point on why start now charging people correctly, there are many instances that people werent charged with some of the same things
[10:32:34] RexPappa: Absolutely
[10:32:38] amavadin: Judge: This is textbook Slacks: OK, let's drop this
[10:32:39] ZuldeadTV: Slacks has a plan, drop all charges make K comissioner give him the whole city as a plus
[10:32:39] RossTheBoss__: Mr K is a criminal mastermind 5Head
[10:32:39] goodtimes54: he kinda screwed the economy and so many other ppl over so if he gets hit with the book i dont mind lol
[10:32:40] BigglesVII: Slacks is the captain, he trumps all but Beric. Not worth getting frustrated.
[10:32:46] Nymsoft: dude this is BAD
[10:32:47] SammytheQueen: this is like interactive law and order
[10:32:47] s0ggybreads: he already gave k a deal before telling him he gave him a deal this is so backwards
[10:32:48] jburke23: I get what you're saying but no matter what there will be mischarges, mistakes, etc and people will get upset. It'll never be perfect and I think you're too worried about making things perfect. I may be wrong though @esfandtv
[10:32:48] 420warlock: you were gonna snag it back and shoot him anyway lol
[10:32:48] bigpharmaa: HOLY CHATTERS essaying
[10:32:50] jinnytolls: @FaahQ2 thats why you correct it
[10:32:50] timedoggg: they not going to raid. All the pd equipment was recovered
[10:32:51] yuudye: feel like slacks and duncan rp is kind of being annoying on purpose to you
[10:32:52] RossTheBoss__: Like a magician with all the smoke and mirriors
[10:32:53] KaycasTV: Let Joel deal with Mr K
[10:32:54] soosmaz74: this should have been over much earlier
[10:32:54] COOLEST_GUY_ON_TWITCH: esfandYou esfandAre
[10:32:55] jbc_inc: Falafel
[10:32:55] acowboy11: @EsfandTV Since his DNA or fingerprints is on the gun doesn't that prove he had it in his possession? I'm so confused
[10:32:57] CptTimberwolf: I mean he's getting Slacks to drop massive charges by Duncaning
[10:32:58] decentenuff: DinoDance
[10:32:58] HeyMeghan: if it wasn‚Äôt his intent to rob you why did he rob your phone from you. also exactly what you said would happen is happening. they shaved off before and now he thinks he isn‚Äôt getting anything taken off.
[10:32:58] iwannanuhh: Slacks needs to take a class on clear communication
[10:32:59] time4sleep: dropping so many charges without Mr K giving ANYTHING yet
[10:33:02] Jeps__: nathankb (Judge Crane) Server policy is to charge Hot Guns right then and there. No later investigation, Warrants etc
[10:33:03] ComaToasted: peepoPopcorn
[10:33:04] bb_woo: What deal whYs he giving pd lol üòÜ
[10:33:05] Doqx42: Now slacks can't make anything ok since now there is nothing left to drop lol
[10:33:05] Shmoopee: See. now hes talking making a deal based off the deal already proposed. esfandPains
[10:33:06] LHaxorP: K def is playign his role +1 this whoel time for sure
[10:33:06] Paxipher: @420warlock dude chill, youre the most toxic chatter ive seen all day for hours hating on cornwood/esfand. chill out
[10:33:06] afghanpsycho: Slacks is such ab ad negotiator.
[10:33:06] Kaisenjin: @FaahQ2 Trying to correct things, so they stop doing wrong process
[10:33:07] burlin_: at this point he should fully charge him. Slacks hasn't gotten any info and dropped like 5 charges even in RP this isn't bad faith
[10:33:07] slomojosh: Beric needs to be debriefed about this
[10:33:08] thespicymeat_: cant drop the charges that had him brought in
[10:33:08] kurwayou: slacks only stacks daps charges on his officers but lets criminals go LUL
[10:33:09] Raja_Banhammer: OMEGALAUGHING
[10:33:10] xblasphemye: why are we dropping charges for what information

[10:33:11] amavadin: Duncaning
[10:33:12] FaahQ2: @jinnytolls why this time tho, why different only for K
[10:33:12] RedRobo: he's literally in no position to request any charges be dropped or to make any deals for the charges being applied. you make a plea deal you don't persuade cops not to charge you LUL
[10:33:12] warner05: NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis

[10:33:17] imtooepic7676: do you think he‚Äôs trying to drop charges to keep Dr K on the server? idk that part of Mr K possible leaving.
[10:33:18] TheDarkNyet: Mr K wants a deal when he hasn‚Äôt offered anything concrete yet in exchange for the reduced sentences
[10:33:19] ZuldeadTV: Because at this point he has Slacks in his hand
[10:33:20] Phage_Cleaver: Chat a bunch of  essay writers today

[10:33:28] lostmindoce: W T F    IS HE DOING
[10:33:28] lepacaJQ: LUL
[10:33:29] soosmaz74: he is saying because he does not know what umbrella charge is
[10:33:29] TimmayHS: idk if I'm just cringe, but it's VERY hard to watch Slacks fuck this up
[10:33:29] Shmoopee: Sadge pushing Esfand to alcoholism
[10:33:29] JohnieP: @esfandtv It sets a bad precedent and then puts future DNA cases at jeopardy.....
[10:33:30] papadooskie: it's a Law and Order episode where the viewers can yell at the actors in the middle of the episode
[10:33:30] pretzelz_kingz: ts umbrella for kidnapping, robbery, or unlawfull entry of police vehiclei
[10:33:31] IncognitoOri: @EsfandTV wasn't the responsibility of the charges put on you? this is actually yours
[10:33:31] bobbybeee: STEP IN THEN, FUCK ME..

[10:43:38] MistaMista: @JustJoshinYa2 yeah the 1400 charge was to stop people from take PD glocks.
[10:43:39] RaunchyOLDwoman: At this point you have done that, you explained it. ALl the officers know what you meant. At this point its just RP to reduce the charges and get Ks stories and send him up
[10:43:40] slomojosh: exactly this is about properly teaching other officers especially Frost
[10:43:40] Kreamydownut: @EsfandTV at this point let them fail, and be the pillar doing things right, cuz at this point you're getting too frustrated and they won't listen. let the ship sink and make it a teachable moment
[10:43:42] DevilDogTash: can‚Äôt understand your perspective because it doesn‚Äôt make sense
[10:43:42] RedRobo: @JustJoshinYa2 if you RP a criminal you get to RP the consequences too 4Shrug
[10:43:42] zzthejimzz: why are so many chatters cringe ITSHIM
[10:43:42] eyeoin: The helping K aspect doesn't really matter because he does't care charges now vs later, it's the same. I understand the PD bit thoguh
[10:43:42] thegungus: I guess this is all happening because Mr K just got pardoned after a 2 hour meeting??
[10:43:44] DazedenConfused: I try not to under think
[10:43:44] k9_goliath: towsand
[10:43:44] suzibaguzi: they all are just playing characters, maybe this is just how slacks the character is playing this situation
[10:43:45] lostmindoce: HES DOING IT SO CRIMS GET A BETTER IDEA OF THE CHARGES THEY WILL FACE
[10:43:46] Froggopop: If K tells the story of why.. Its wild!
[10:43:46] TheDarkNyet: K shouldn‚Äôt have done what he did
[10:43:46] Leafyerick: @JustJoshinYa2 His break is all the shit he gets away with
[10:43:46] jburke23: @shakalakin I totally get that but at the same time you can tell everyone in the server and explain things a hundred times it will still happen
[10:43:47] Berserake: He already has a break why are people arguing that he gets a break on his already getting a break
[10:43:49] Mastodonian: One guys

[10:44:15] thealiien: @EsfandTV he should sell hot guns to people no?
[10:44:16] KaycasTV: @el3v3n_tv there was no scuff.
[10:44:17] jinnytolls: @JustJoshinYa2 bruh why does he deserver a break, he did serious crimes. There are plenty of other things you can do in the city other than rob espcially with a clean record
[10:44:18] TheMah1337: tell him that the possession of a pd glock being taken off is part of the plea deal so if he doesnt plead guilty he will be charged with that too
[10:44:19] suzibaguzi: it is very good RP, sometime you just have to let people do thing incorrectly (slacks)
[10:44:21] marczm4n: allegedly

[10:44:21] jagy3k: YouGotMe

[10:44:22] HadEbola: mr k wants a break? he just got pardoned? this is more than ever the time to crack down on getting the charges correct
[10:44:25] Phage_Cleaver: Is he also being charged with Murder?
[10:44:26] bakerboy404: Cornwood is a victim, why is he in the charges discussion
[10:44:27] Vikairius: They haven't check Ks DNA for other cases which probably comes back to a few

[10:53:39] Mtayh: Robbery is typically defined as taking property from another person by force or threat of force. Even if the criminal's primary intent was to kidnap the officer rather than to steal from him, the act of forcing the officer to drop his belongings and then taking those belongings constitutes robbery. The criminal's intentions regarding the belongings (whether to keep, discard, or merely move them) are secondary to the fact that he took control of the property through force or intimidation.

[10:55:25] mattchutt: WHY
[10:55:27] mikkelite: the two ladys are already confused so
[10:55:27] s0ggybreads: but why not
[10:55:27] RAMEEKILLEDSAMBAAS: Ghost of Ruth ~ gotta go by the book!
[10:55:27] Wynter282: @9t_Nyne he has over 2 days worth of charges its not even close to time served
[10:55:28] MrActivated: the umbrella charge
[10:55:29] UPRIGHT77: you care that the one charge was missed that‚Äôs this issue
[10:55:30] AnnoyedWithChat: It won't get through to him LUL
[10:55:34] ens0mniac: tell slacks he skipped into making a deal before setting the table correctly @esfandtv
[10:55:34] RexPappa: Slacks will die on any hill
[10:55:35] xblasphemye: yeah literally slacks is greifing
[10:55:37] Doqx42: That is the problem by saying we aren't pursuing it
[10:55:39] jbc_inc: NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[10:55:40] ZuldeadTV: Slacks explained him hastily without clearing with the team
[10:55:40] s0ggybreads: we should be charging that
[10:55:40] bigpharmaa: Duncaning in circles EZ
[10:55:43] kylef_: slacks is throwing
[10:55:43] lostmindoce: Ssssslacks did NOT explain it all, you need to bro @EsfandTV
[10:55:45] DevilDogTash: if a judge looks at BOTH possessions and robbery they will say no robbery covers it.
[10:55:46] TheFairn: he said he doesnt feel comfortable pushing the possesion like it doesnt apply lol
[10:55:46] timedoggg: you were afk when he said that to him
[10:55:46] energizergeyser: THATS THE POINT SLACKS
[10:55:48] destinygun: My man said robbery is an umbrella charge too
[10:55:48] TimmayHS: THE JUDGE SAID ITS TEXTBOOK
[10:55:48] shin5sato3: HOLY FUCK
[10:55:49] dapyman: esfandRage esfandRage esfandRage
[10:55:52] Bear_Otter: @jkline89 it's not a matter of weight tho, it's a matter of density. The mass of a gun is more compact then that of a car. A car will not float after it water displaces the air causing the car to maintain some level of buoyancy
[10:55:52] thysiastery: slacks makes me so mad lmao
[10:55:53] deadbyhunting: lol Slacks is still not convinced on the possession
[10:55:58] GwG_Torch: ‚Äúsure‚Äù LMAO
[10:56:03] TimmayHS: @thysiastery I cannot stand him right now
[10:56:04] time4sleep: Yep
[10:56:07] emery_steele: he's using officer discression too early
[10:56:07] time4sleep: YEP
[10:56:08] nantredan: I think the funniest part is that the clowns were more successful at kidnapping cornwood than criminal mastermind Mr K
[10:56:08] mattchutt: @thysiastery deadass
[10:56:09] LHaxorP: Clap finally cleanly stated
[10:56:09] coppertec: start at the top THEN work it down
[10:56:10] Paxipher: absolutely 100%
[10:56:10] Ciefon: YEP
[10:56:10] EmDuBB13: i think slacks jus wants to know wtf u wanna charge and get done lololol
[10:56:12] energizergeyser: @Joongi_ help me out here im getting too invested OMEGALAUGHING
[10:56:17] GettingToasty22: crazy idea maybe slacks wants to let the man rp and not just lock him up for 2 days lol
[10:56:18] morgado_4: why didn‚Äôt abeliene get the same treatment
[10:56:19] Shakalakin: This is some deep RP that has gone to OOC
[10:56:19] xblasphemye: slacks needs to admit he is wrong but the dude is completely incapable
[10:56:20] IckyStickyG00: Clap
[10:56:22] shin5sato3: CornWall SLACKS
[10:56:23] realitywolfdog: Crime does NOT pay !!!!
[10:56:27] xblasphemye: i think slacks needs counciling
[10:56:27] Wynter282: literally 5 people telling slacks hes wrong and hes still like a brick wall
[10:56:27] DevilDogTash: @timmayhs the judge wasn‚Äôt provided full information‚Ä¶ he didn‚Äôt say compare these two charges
[10:56:29] TheFairn: put EVERY CHARGE ON, go in, say these are your charges. now HERES what were willing to do
[10:56:30] warner05: BASED
[10:56:33] CowWizardMoneyGang: @Shakalakin it doesnt seem ooc at all?
[10:56:40] TheSoldier1851: Should've shot Slacks that one night MiniK
[10:56:41] bussingtin: how many times this gotta be explained lol
[10:56:41] xblasphemye: @Wynter282 its insane
[10:56:42] energizergeyser: @DevilDogTash but he did
[10:56:46] ComradeGreetingCard: you just explained the dap system issue
[10:56:50] bertacharm: the osvaldo case
[10:56:54] ImGoingGhostOG: He literally told him that they have him for possession which is 100k fine and another day in prison , how did he skip that step ?
[10:56:56] EmDuBB13: @CowWizardMoneyGang its not ooc lol
[10:56:57] Shmoopee: The viewer. also. maybe doesnt get it too. maybe.
[10:56:58] TimmayHS: How is Slacks a captain but doesn't know how to charge someone based on evidence instead of "the criminal doesn't agree with this"
[10:56:58] Doqx42: @bussingtin 2 1/2 months so far to Slacks
[10:56:58] xblasphemye: @bussingtin for slacks about a million years
[10:57:03] Joongi_: @energizergeyser You're asking the wrong person kekw
[10:57:06] Cthyllah: cornwood is trying to keep the thing that happened with osvaldo from happening again i think
[10:57:08] CowWizardMoneyGang: @EmDuBB13 say that to the guy that is saying it is
[10:57:09] MrActivated: i miss Cornwood lawyer arc SADGE
[10:57:11] LHaxorP: Clap finally cleanly stated CORNMAN
[10:57:12] DevilDogTash: @energizergeyser no he didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ he said if dna was found on weapon but wasn‚Äôt in possession is that a possession charge
[10:57:13] walnutszs: you are spot on
[10:57:14] 360ski: abdulDrool abdulDrool abdulDrool
[10:57:15] Ross_McD: bargaining for time is good for small stuff. Something this big needs to go to court
[10:57:18] EmDuBB13: @CowWizardMoneyGang oops
[10:57:20] kylef_: YEP
[10:57:20] Shakalakin: @CowWizardMoneyGang Esfand said he was getting frustrated. I would bet others are too.
[10:57:20] T_Rippin: Suggestion hey if you wanna go to court, tack on everysingle charge. if you want to take what we have on the table now then take that deal? just a thought not my RP
[10:57:21] jinnytolls: Great articulation @EsfandTV
[10:57:21] science_envisions: sounds like we need lawyers in academy
[10:57:22] juanelemichele: Storm coming.
[10:57:22] amBrint: he did do that????????? slacks did do that lol. So pressed about nothing lol
[10:57:24] TimmayHS: Slacks should remove himself from this situation
[10:57:25] RyanMcGoose: we have to help them do crime better, which is illegal and bad NODDERS
[10:57:27] Wallsh_: its too late now
[10:57:27] marczm4n: exactly
[10:57:29] ZuldeadTV: jesus
[10:57:29] EmDuBB13: @CowWizardMoneyGang your right lmaoooooo
[10:57:30] slomojosh: it‚Äôs not about the charge it‚Äôs about the entire menu
[10:57:31] CowWizardMoneyGang: @Shakalakin thats emotions not ooc
[10:57:34] Wallsh_: he doesn't get it
[10:57:35] AFellowDegen: but you still need to tell that to him
[10:57:36] Ciefon: man, slacks is arguing in circles
[10:57:37] Kolipto: So you got step 1 half right because they were negotiating at the same time.
[10:57:37] 1manpizza: Be clear if it's a plea deal or just him snitching on others
[10:57:38] Shmoopee: He still doesnt get it.
[10:57:38] jinnytolls: Its not too late now
[10:57:39] RAMEEKILLEDSAMBAAS: Good faith in rp
[10:57:40] mattchutt: you need to tell it how it is.. u put gun on ground he picked it up. he possessed it end of story lol
[10:57:40] ens0mniac: slacks started making a deal after already taking things off the table @esfandtv please just tell him that
[10:57:40] TenderPantyz: docSmash
[10:57:42] energizergeyser: @DevilDogTash do you know what possession means, he had his DNA on the gun that means he POSSESED it
[10:57:43] s0ggybreads: so you not gonna charge him because you thing you charge him to much what the hell
[10:57:44] chewymorsel: the back and forth of adding and removing charges is causing a bigger issue for the immediate i feel.
[10:57:45] shin5sato3: #LostCause
[10:57:45] PokeMom019: LUL
[10:57:46] BBCapitalist: @TimmayHS its rp man, either way people want to have fun. its not real life
[10:57:46] Sweet_BabyJeebus: there you go
[10:57:47] Rivath: This is 99% of what chatting to Ssaab is like btw
[10:57:47] Koolers_Mobile: This needs to go to court the charges are to big.
[10:57:48] AFellowDegen: he doesn't get it still
[10:57:49] Shakalakin: @CowWizardMoneyGang GJ Batman
[10:57:51] jagy3k: cmonnn
[10:57:52] Perne78: bringing up daps is probably not the right argument for cordwood being right lol.  he got called out pretty hard in the last council meeting on that one
[10:57:52] daedayz: hes literally trying to fight for the RP at this point yo
[10:57:52] TheFairn: hit him with the book, full fines, give him alot less time
[10:57:53] HoeTown: moon2HUH
[10:57:54] Potato_Nation19: He keeps saying PURSUE the charge. Slacks it is a charge, it can be dropped, it doesnt HAVE to be pursued
[10:57:54] Kiyoni: He still doesn't understand OMEGALUL
[10:57:54] dapyman: One person has to lead and take full control at this point
[10:57:55] epik8ightyse7en: They could of consider the scuff off duty. If that didn;t scuff he would of got away with it lol
[10:57:55] slomojosh: he‚Äôs banking on him not cooperating now
[10:57:55] PowerTurbo: cornwood is right
[10:57:55] scopedin07: yes but you can drop the charge in negotiations
[10:57:55] 360ski: 5 mins warning!
[10:57:57] Wallsh_: START HIGH THEN BARGAIN LOWER
[10:57:58] oofinside: hmjj
[10:57:59] Muip: @EsfandTV I feel some cops are trying to make it a 1 step process instead of a 2 step process.  Step 1) Go over everything and all charges.  Step 2) Give it a minute and come back and discuss possible dropped charges
[10:57:59] GwG_Torch: stronger argument now than another situation from before.
[10:57:59] CptTimberwolf: Sadeg He still doesn't understand
[10:58:01] anoobmove_twitch: it‚Äôs like saying the having a taser and PD Glock are the same in terms of a charge.
[10:58:01] Cowlowries: you‚Äôre the victim.  they need to press the charges, not you
[10:58:02] nlwatcher: So lets argue more
[10:58:04] CowWizardMoneyGang: @Shakalakin Clown
[10:58:05] RAMEEKILLEDSAMBAAS: Going in circles lol
[10:58:08] xblasphemye: ADD THEM JESUS
[10:58:10] coppertec: THATS MY CAPTAIN
[10:58:10] walkgleesh: soft banning a character for days to an empty jail over semantics is too much. Slacks seeing the ooc perspective
[10:58:10] warner05: SHITSHOW
[10:58:11] Muip: I feel some cops are trying to make it a 1 step process instead of a 2 step process.  Step 1) Go over everything and all charges.  Step 2) Give it a minute and come back and discuss possible dropped charges
[10:58:13] twirlyD: SLACKS ffs he ain't trying to get the charge re-added NOW. he is just saying it should be there at the start before negotiating FailFish
[10:58:14] GLSMarbles: SHITSHOW
[10:58:14] nnnk: LOST ALL LEVERAGE
[10:58:14] Sweet_BabyJeebus: just explain in good faith to Mr. K
[10:58:15] DevilDogTash: @energizergeyser that‚Äôs not the argument pay attention to‚Ä¶ robbery includes the weapon.  it‚Äôs double charging.
[10:58:15] wonderwood: HAVE CRANE CHARGE HIM
[10:58:15] Shmoopee: He wants to make a deal off the deal.
[10:58:15] sendemup: LEO "BONEHEAD" SLACKS
[10:58:17] tacticallupus: yes *doesnt understand*
[10:58:18] Mouso9: Mouso9 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! I don't understand why your trying so hard for a guild verdict? Seams like a guilty pleasure should olny be on the table if they offer you somthing in return...
[10:58:18] TheDarkNyet: Slacks needs to be a lawyer for a week
[10:58:19] STUNNER310: slacks doesn‚Äôt understand that he can bring up the charge and then can deal down
[10:58:19] s0ggybreads: he doesnt get it
[10:58:20] TimmayHS: @BBCapitalist right, but the problem is.. this isn't fun it's just aggravating. Maybe im just being a cringe RP viewer though
[10:58:20] marczm4n: things shouldn‚Äôt have been on the table is slacks point
[10:58:21] slomojosh: BASED NEKODA
[10:58:21] CptTimberwolf: KEKW
[10:58:21] LHaxorP: ita kinda late now Yep
[10:58:23] slomojosh: HOLY
[10:58:25] Kaisenjin: @Cthyllah Osvaldo and others, Cornwood understood the law/process better than a Captain MAAAAN
[10:58:25] CptTimberwolf: BASED
[10:58:26] CowWizardMoneyGang: he threw it
[10:58:26] kylef_: BASED RARE NEKODA W
[10:58:27] TenderPantyz: NotLikeThis
[10:58:28] marczm4n: exactly
[10:58:30] 1manpizza: Does it matter LULE
[10:58:30] TimmayHS: How did the pallet get in the glovebox?
[10:58:31] emery_steele: doesn't matter, his DNA is on it
[10:58:32] Ciefon: dna = possession
[10:58:34] MrActivated: when he drove the car into the water omE
[10:58:34] nikkelodean: this shit going in circles for over 2 hours üòÇüòÇ
[10:58:35] RAMEEKILLEDSAMBAAS: K probably gonna wait for like 5 hrs
[10:58:36] JustJoshinYa2: @TimmayHS Slacks is just trying to cut K a break. You guys are so push the book when slacks actually understand RP is more than that. K was literally kidnapping Cornwood for a whole RP scenario for Tessa it's not like he was just randomly kidnapping and robbing cops
[10:58:37] marczm4n: slacks is right
[10:58:37] daedayz: hes bad
[10:58:40] ZuldeadTV: yeah nekoda is shy
[10:58:42] energizergeyser: @DevilDogTash and thats not the arguement here, slacks refuses to give the full menu which includes possession
[10:58:44] Shakalakin: @CowWizardMoneyGang  do you know what OOC is? Regular RP is  in RP getting frustrated IRL is OOC
[10:58:44] marczm4n: and I hate to say it
[10:58:44] Sweet_BabyJeebus: you are the public laioson
[10:58:44] Kalious78: You've spent an hour crying about something you can't change just let them get on with it n stop dragging this out
[10:58:44] Mouso9: Fucking fat fingers on phone...
[10:58:47] Raja_Banhammer: GETALIFE TALK TO NEKODA ALREADY
[10:58:48] Doqx42: IT LITERALLY DOESN'T MATTER HOW THEY GOT THERE LOL
[10:58:48] WarrenPuffit: <message sent to jail for 48 hours>
[10:58:49] weinerschnitzel__: nekoda was needed here
[10:58:49] Brakon: Nekoda is just quiet
[10:58:50] tiden5725: everybody gets it but Slacks
[10:58:51] BBCapitalist: @TimmayHS a little bit but that's ok, it is a frustrating thing to watch i dont blame you
[10:58:51] nlwatcher: i cant listen the circular conversation again lol, ill be back in 30 minutes
[10:58:52] Gusty331: 1. say all the charges. 2. Negotiate
[10:58:53] TimmayHS: @JustJoshinYa2 no, slacks is doing things out of order
[10:58:54] 360ski: 3 minutes til storm
[10:58:54] mattchutt: @Kalious78 whos fucking crying
[10:58:55] Caste15: this shit taking a grippy
[10:58:55] memereku: moon viewers stirring against nekoda WeirdDude
[10:58:56] Shmoopee: Poor Esfand. Esfand is just like Slacks. and doesnt get it.
[10:58:56] nimbleop: Doesn't matter.. he had dna on the gun.. he had it.. fck the story...
[10:58:57] ZuldeadTV: i'm sold, nekoda is just shy, he's cool
[10:58:57] lda1cuh: @justjoshinya2 only good chatter in here
[10:58:58] ens0mniac: dna = possession, location of the gun is totally irrelevant
[10:58:58] xblasphemye: he dropped them in the river wtf
[10:58:59] MrActivated: Nekoda will get better now that hes free xdd
[10:59:00] MinotaurFluff: Court kivaCheer
[10:59:02] Septylo: Nekoda is a W y'all are wack
[10:59:03] kylef_: xdd
[10:59:03] Ciefon: @JustJoshinYa2 you're also not listening to esfand then
[10:59:03] xblasphemye: the gun didnt float
[10:59:04] jinnytolls: Slacks didnt have the full story and therefore messed up the interegation/charges. That needs to be made clear when yall tell him the new charges
[10:59:04] Zolothan: there are other considerations here you're steamrolling past
[10:59:05] CowWizardMoneyGang: @Shakalakin "RP that has gone to OOC"
[10:59:06] iwannanuhh: I have to run to homedepot to buy drywall, need to fix my wall after I put my face through it while listening to Slacks arguing this
[10:59:07] EmDuBB13: ya he jus never speaks up in meetings
[10:59:09] Shakalakin: @Shakalakin Anyway you win Batman. LUL it wasn't an invitation to argue
[10:59:09] neighborhoodcapricorn: @JustJoshinYa2 You can have the same charges and do things correctly
[10:59:12] itsrambo: this is getting exhausting
[10:59:13] salvi9: @esfandtv it feels like slacks doesn‚Äôt fully understand what you‚Äôre tryna say but everyone else does?
[10:59:13] BigglesVII: Yeah the key was reeling the charges off before any negotiation. They were arguing charges before that happend this time.
[10:59:16] RexPappa: Letter of the lol
[10:59:17] Wynter282: @JustJoshinYa2 yea because he has never randomly kidnapped and robbed cops before
[10:59:17] catfish_quackenbush: Wasnt the gun found upstream from where the car was? How did gun flow upstream
[10:59:18] TXCVulture: GETALIFE KISS SLACKS
[10:59:18] tacticallupus: literally only slacks thinks this.. like i dont understand what happening
[10:59:21] slomojosh: CG Slacks
[10:59:22] couchconner: Why wasnt the lawyer hit with possession then
[10:59:22] GlitchyGunZ: technically, the judge said if you saw him with the weapon and you have DNA you‚Äôre missing the part where nobody saw him with it @esfandtv claiming he put it in the glove box to explain dna right
[10:59:24] zzzzzzz8133: guys nekota is legit trying to help cornwood with his reasoning not going against him
[10:59:26] CptTimberwolf: YEP
[10:59:27] CowWizardMoneyGang: @Shakalakin Pepega
[10:59:29] AnnoyedWithChat: YEP that's it
[10:59:29] warner05: Letter of the LULS
[10:59:29] AFellowDegen: TRUE
[10:59:29] albakrut: Slacks told him about the posession of a firearm. No?
[10:59:30] 360ski: Shit my clock is wrong, wtf
[10:59:32] emery_steele: slacks DonoWall
[10:59:32] Potato_Nation19: true
[10:59:33] jaredfranz_: endless circle of crims appealing
[10:59:34] RexPappa: thats just regular slacks
[10:59:35] bmrobirts35: @esfandtv your doin a great job homie thanks for the show
[10:59:36] DevilDogTash: @energizergeyser it‚Äôs not the argument anymore because cornwood didn‚Äôt tell the judge to compare both charges. holy crap did you pay attention at all?
[10:59:37] mcknizzle90: charge him and send him off, K is just going to try to drag it out again haha
[10:59:37] Whiezy: you want to give him everything under the sun and then give him a little shade after.  make sure everything is out and itemized. then start the guilty plea process.
[10:59:38] weinerschnitzel__: willful ignorance
[10:59:38] TimmayHS: Remove Slacks from this and you save at least an hour
[10:59:38] marczm4n: no slacks understands. he thinks you‚Äôre wrong
[10:59:39] epik8ightyse7en: letter of the law that one woman better found guilty then for having a pd gun lol
[10:59:40] Sairaph117: Slacks is weirdly desperate for a guilty plea to end this shit.
[10:59:41] zeldaspirit: TableHere TableHere
[10:59:44] khrow: Kebun is having a great time sitting in an empty room while everyone argues out here for an hour
[10:59:44] 360ski: It's 1 hour off NotLikeThis
[10:59:44] Wallsh_: @JustJoshinYa2 he's not trying to push the book.  he wants to present ALL THE CHARGES the suspect could be charged with and then deal with the suspect and try to get info.  Instead of rushing and adding a charge after working on a plea deal.
[10:59:45] PappaMidNight: Slack gets it now. he just wants to charge for him to get money for pd
[10:59:45] WarrenPuffit: guys slacks just feels bad for sending someone to jail for 2 IRL DAYS
[10:59:49] Wetidiot: @EsfandTV CAUGHT oh no, i dropped the pd glock .2 seconds before you cuffed me, not possession btw CAUGHT
[10:59:49] dapyman: It's the judges job, lol
[10:59:50] Shmoopee: I dont think anyone understands. I think they're just trying to push charges. honestly
[10:59:50] mrburns40: this is so great
[10:59:52] crowgoes: Pretty sure slacks understands
[10:59:52] Bigeyez: Slacks totally understand guys. He doesn't want to charge K with possession of the PD glock
[10:59:53] tiden5725: 100% Slacks is the one who doesn't get it @EsfandTV
[10:59:53] energizergeyser: @DevilDogTash yes and clearly you didnt because HE DID ASKED THE JUDGE OMEGALAUGHING
[10:59:53] Phage_Cleaver: @EsfandTV  I think Slacks understands. He just doesnt want to screw K
[10:59:54] xblasphemye: HUH
[10:59:55] bobbybeee: you're all going round in circles now...
[10:59:56] Raja_Banhammer: Yeah cornwood just name dropped gatsby Aware

[11:02:21] DabNDolly: Can you suggest slacks get into a law class for a week or something so he understands the law more
[11:02:22] oofinside: YouGotMe
[11:02:22] layziep: esfandL
[11:02:23] soosmaz74: I think u just need to put everything on the table for him. he either pleads guilty or wants to go to court
[11:02:25] Capacchino: ...why don't you want to charge him? Because it wasn't initially brought up?
[11:02:25] RomanNumera: Ssaab is so confused lol. He thinks you want to send K up for all the charges and doesn't get that you are ok with dropping charges only after they've been explained.
[11:02:27] wnderlst: GO BACK IN THERE AND LAY IT OUT FLAT CORNWOOD YOU GOT THIS!

[11:06:31] nimbleop: That was handled wrong by the captain
[11:06:31] driver1036: But if you don't charge him then its open season on robbing cops
[11:06:31] Netopi: too many cooks burnt the chicken

[11:06:33] bigpharmaa: stop trying to be the savior
[11:06:34] arcticOP: this is what happens when you lower a charge and allow him to aruge down the lowered charge
[11:06:34] fishiegoblublub: tbf this is akin to a serial killer with a sentence of multiple lifetimes but they actually have to sit it, its just a little heavy despite the fact that they are super guilty
[11:06:34] Hitmehn_: its the 2 days in jail for trying to rp in a game thats the issue
[11:06:35] Ikilledkenny91: He didn't want to spend 3 days in jail @esfandtv that's why he didn't want you to bring it up He KNEW he was getting away without the gun charge
[11:06:35] DonnieRockettt: Just ocean dump self and forget everything LUL

[11:06:36] TheNachoManRandyCabbage: i wouldnt worry so much about down the road. Just live in the now babyyyyy
[11:06:36] Raja_Banhammer: @Kaseyfullofjoy mr k talks shit about cornwood all the time
[11:06:36] Berserake: Bro didnt want to take the plea deal so now hes mad hes getting charged? Makes no sense
[11:06:36] crescenterra: just do a Tony Andrews on him, perma K and end this misery
[11:06:38] jinnytolls: The problem is that the charges and story wasnt lined up before slacks went in there and then the argument happened infront of K who slung mud the entire time casting doubt @EsfandTV
[11:06:38] lda1cuh: HOW
[11:06:39] MrBASins: that was crazy taking bout prossing taking to long

[11:06:47] deafguy87: just let him sink 4Shrug
[11:06:49] BatChestington: @esfandtv why do we talking with them and negotiate and let them pick their own charges?
[11:06:49] marczm4n: everyone is listening
[11:06:49] bb_woo: Some rpers are just in to deep to help lolüëçüòé
[11:06:50] chivvyy: and you're gonna get blamed for it all now atpCap
[11:06:50] JustJoshinYa2: You didn't help you just gave Kevin a 3 day soft ban
[11:06:52] ABirky: I've never liked K as a character TBH. Does the crime then acts a victim when he gets caught, and claims unfair treatment when he's been arrested several times for prior felonies. My man got pardoned by the Mayor and then went and did this. No hate to the streamer, though.
[11:06:52] k9_goliath: Sometimes the best way for people to learn is to let them break it themselves Cheer100
[11:06:53] AFellowDegen: everyone but slacks and k listened to you
[11:06:53] volicarebear: I think sometimes when you explain things it doesn‚Äôt come out right and confuses people
[11:06:55] nanitheheck: you're not articulating how you're helping k tho
[11:06:55] Beast_SyCo: What's sad is you should have been signed off duty and this never would have happened

[11:06:57] jaredfranz_: only slacks isnt listening
[11:06:57] nikkelodean: brother that was not helping K at all
[11:06:58] bertacharm: you clearly said you wanted it explained and not pushed llike 3 times
[11:06:58] deafguy87: OMEGALAUGHING
[11:06:58] Sweet_BabyJeebus: Slacks gave you the go ahead
[11:06:59] deafguy87: just let him sink 4Shrug
[11:06:59] rutako: YOU CHARGE, LAWYERS JOB IS TO REDUCE CHARGES IN A DEAL
[11:06:59] energizergeyser: @JustJoshinYa2 youre so dumb
[11:07:00] 1manpizza: They all listened, slacks just went ahead anyways LULE
[11:07:00] ooCORSAIRoo: you aint help shit
[11:07:00] Kaseyfullofjoy: @Raja_Banhammer yah thats what i hear i guess it never gets to him that cornwood like every day advocates for him. almost daily lol
[11:07:01] condor2104: don‚Äôt go back leave it
[11:07:03] Lordgorehand: You wanted to let him go?
[11:07:03] Roughneck108: should prob take care of all the evidence you have stacked up in all our inventories after that LUL
[11:07:03] viralostrich: We need a rebirth.
[11:07:03] the_real_jfk: Cornwood is good at seeing the problems and solutions but terrible at explaining himself
[11:07:03] DBZSnack: @EsfandTV he a crim he dont care . you a pretty great cop. but he supposed to act like this
[11:07:06] ens0mniac: FF7 now Madge @esfandtv
[11:07:06] Shmoopee: Why didnt you say exactly that!
[11:07:06] MinotaurFluff: Everyone BUT slacks understood
[11:07:06] jokerm21: you needed to go in there and roll everything back and start from step one
[11:07:07] SumDee_LumDee: go back down there
[11:07:07] Wynter282: why? he did it
[11:07:08] rabbyraptor: Yeah Slacks messed up and Cornwood is paying the price...
[11:07:08] ZuldeadTV: they're listening to you man slacks is being insane and K wants what's best for him
[11:07:08] dholdren12: just leave it

[11:07:10] soosmaz74: chat are you not listening to him
[11:07:10] JoeSizzle7: You can't expect people to accept unwarranted help even if it is coming from a good place
[11:07:10] MrActivated: @EsfandTV what you tried to avoid , ended up happening! Û†ÄÄ
[11:07:11] Neekapkilla: ONLY SLACKS doesn't listen to Cornwood but you keep RPing like Slacks is your best friend lol
[11:07:12] catfish_quackenbush: this was a huge misunderstanding and lack of communication. Slacks told him all the charges, but quickly removed the possesion and such. Mr K understood and knows what is going on,
[11:07:12] Jungle_Ben: 
[11:07:12] EmDuBB13: dm him that hes a dumbass lol and explain
[11:07:13] Scotty_RP: @EsfandTV  TIME IN A CELL WITH NO RP IS THE MOST DISRESPECT.
[11:07:13] TraviTV: If you don't properly list the charges then they can't even perceive the plea deal they are getting.
[11:07:13] Ferfind69: It is what it is Clap
[11:07:14] Toastedgamer03: honestly interrogation shouldn't have even started until those reports got situated and charges were made for those
[11:07:14] Perne78: you've spent 3 hours talking about it... would have been a lot less messier if you just didn't talk lol
[11:07:14] SavageTarzan: Sludge
[11:07:15] Jomuse92: it's hard for Cornwood because most do see him as the fat funny guy
[11:07:15] Cthyllah: you‚Äôre trying to keep what happened to osvaldo the other day from happening again
[11:07:16] CptTimberwolf: He doesn't seem to care, so just let him suffer the consequences of his actions EZ
[11:07:17] Viske: fuck it, he's a crim EZ
[11:07:17] JasonMunday: DROP AND GIVE ME 10
[11:07:18] PappaMidNight: @viralostrich dont wish that evil on us

[11:07:20] TimmayHS: LITERALLY everyone agrees with you in RP @EsfandTV
[11:07:22] CowWizardMoneyGang: why are people purposely misunderstanding everything you do irl and in rp?
[11:07:23] Jomuse92: so he's hard to take seriously unfortunately
[11:07:23] nimbleop: Let thgem handle it
[11:07:23] PrettyKrazy: i dont get it, he can appeal later
[11:07:24] BigglesVII: Everyone is listening to Cornwood except Slacks. It's not everyone ignoring Cornwood.
[11:07:25] WarrenPuffit: <message sent to jail for 48 hours>
[11:07:27] TomatoPhalanges: @EsfandTV chatters have no fucking clue, slacks doesnt understand, k is trying to antagonize, its a SHITSHOW
[11:07:28] s1cKNation: K just mad, and slacks throwing ICANT
[11:07:28] nick_cola86: don't interact with CG after they get arrested... it's lose lose dude
[11:07:29] Dirtyjim: play stupid games win stupid prizes. assert dominance for the PD
[11:07:29] MadderHatter: slacks went in there and talked down his charges before everything was set
[11:07:31] kingkoolkattz: the short of it is, Slacks need to change his comms
[11:07:32] HoeTown: slacks wasn't understanding that you wanted to present all charges, then remove them, he thought you wanted to press all charges
[11:07:32] ksoxaien: put items in the evidence before you forgot
[11:07:32] TheDarkNyet: at this point, just know that whatever happens isn‚Äôt on you. It‚Äôs on Slacks

[11:07:34] Leafyerick: Shoots multiple cops, forces multiple cops to jump off bridges, steals and destroys multiple cop cars and steal their turbos, shoots and robs multiple sani and G6 workers without ever getting caught. Cries and complains over getting caught for one thing
[11:07:34] striggly_diggly: @EsfandTV it seems like both you and ssaab both dont want to charge him and are both trying to achieve the same thing in roundabout ways so its making things more frustrating than it should be?
[11:07:34] stoynk: its their pov of cornwood
[11:07:34] tiden5725: Let K burn
[11:07:35] daedayz: yea but why would K care that u want to push proper procedure? hes the crim. he should be pissed imo
[11:07:35] TimmayHS: Slacks is actually being stupid
[11:07:36] deadbyhunting: Yeah Cornwood would have made a deal in good faith, but Mr.K wouldn't even know what a good deal is without knowing the full list of charges
[11:07:36] mikkelite: he wasnt cooperative so fuck him
[11:07:36] Raja_Banhammer: @Kaseyfullofjoy i mean thats just mr k i guess lol
[11:07:36] lda1cuh: The content in this city will be worse for 2 days. 25k can‚Äôt watch k for 2 days. thats not helpful to a content server @esfandtv
[11:07:37] ZuldeadTV: Nekoda insta agreed with you
[11:07:37] coppertec: its the same thing in sales, you dont start discounting the item from the start, you start at the top and let them work it back
[11:07:37] bertacharm: you clearly said you wanted it explained and not pushed like 3 times idk what else you could do
[11:07:37] chaosKahn: K is just salty he got caught and can't just go on a criminal rampage willy nilly and kidnap/rob every cop in the city. Like yeah that shit is gonna catch up to you eventually, that's part of the Cops & Robbers game
[11:07:38] 360ski: Cornwood needs food badly! Cornwood is about to die!

[11:21:35] TheDarkNyet: yall might have been able to reach a deal if Slacks hadn‚Äôt jumped the gun and skipped the step

[11:24:03] LegitBanana_: @JustJoshinYa2 you know what youre right that was wrong of me to say. @DBZSnack
[11:24:03] dholdren12: he was going to act that way regardless its because he got caught
[11:24:03] stopthecatbox: he was doing this from the start tho

[11:24:17] nlwatcher: so if you knew this was going to happen you sohuldnt have pressed the charge after it was already dropped
[11:24:17] chillaxinvibes: why is Slacks talking about personnel issues with a CRIMINAL??!
[11:24:18] BigglesVII: Yeah, he knows he has to take the deal on the table cause he won't win a possession appeal
[11:24:18] Robbathehutt: I think the criminals act like this because it takes cops 10,000 years to process them so it makes them hate this in and out of character.

[11:26:02] AndHaka54: things went wrong was cuz Slacks was already doing things his way but when you came in and tried to make slacks understand your point it convoluted everything
[11:26:05] TheDarkNyet: attempted murder charges need to be WAY more severe since nobody wants to perma their cheracters
[11:26:05] RedRobo: he has no right to disarm a LEO he's kidnapping
[11:26:08] DrWetbone: you may be right, but arguing with a captain in front of a suspect if bad and gave K the room to do all this arguing
[11:26:08] ItsSkaara: why she assume and make her own stories? thats scary af LUL
[11:26:08] RedRobo: LUL
[11:26:09] KevinnTCG: he could have you put it all in the trunk and get in the car
[11:26:12] Raja_Banhammer: @crowgoes id rather them deliberate about charges than just put some bullshit on in 5 seconds and call it a day tbh
[11:26:19] warner05: WHAT ABOUTISMS
[11:26:20] marczm4n: far from it
[11:26:20] deafguy87: just charge em 4Shrug
[11:26:20] Koolers_Mobile: We lost the rp at this point it just power for the win in this

[11:26:48] jinnytolls: PUNCHING MENTOR
[11:26:48] Mastodonian: Hug him SAJ
[11:26:49] Leafyerick: The only way to save this now is to toss the possession and robbery in exchange for kidnapping
[11:26:49] RedRobo: honestly duncan might have had it coming LUL
[11:26:49] Kowlineos: What I undestood about this, is that the possession charges were made in the first place to possible being dropped later. The fact was that Esfand wanted to make clear to Mr K that if ever possessed a gun and the dropped somewhere before being caught, he would still be charged with possession if the gun was later recovered.
[11:26:51] CptTimberwolf: K's yapping triggered your Duncaning fight or flight response Classic

[11:26:54] Kaisenjin: @Shnygut Depending on the decision of the police, the chargers may fall, but something will remain because if there was a crime, some charge will be charged.
[11:26:55] MahanGM: Duncaning  cletus, people like me
[11:26:57] layziep: Bro I'm fucking dying lmao

[11:26:58] JayJayMills: is this like a  mini trial? shouldn't this be a "we're at A, your want to be at C, let's find B" conversation?
[11:26:59] crowgoes: @Raja_Banhammer yeah im just saying from his perspective
[11:27:00] Sweet_BabyJeebus: he took it like a champ

[11:27:02] Toastbane: Mr. K should be sentenced to play a cop
[11:27:04] PeculiarEboy: cornwood is definitely getting targeted after this and denied rp
[11:27:05] science_envisions: so if he didn;t pick up the gun and left it there, we wouldn't be in this pickle
[11:27:08] 360ski: Duncan is going to burn down MRPD LUL LUL
[11:27:08] maestro__21: You should talk to him

[11:27:11] Raja_Banhammer: @crowgoes yeah i get that
[11:27:13] BattleAlpaca: plea deal to kidnappiong for the story of what happened
[11:27:14] Kaseyfullofjoy: @PeculiarEboy lol

[11:27:22] TrippMinds: Hopefully that punch debuff his yapping
[11:27:23] Pakkasparkers: no
[11:27:24] Sweet_BabyJeebus: stern Cornwood was more effective
[11:27:24] holymoly_02: yeah
[11:27:25] soosmaz74: So when is he going to tell us his story
[11:27:25] warner05: Mr K is SOOOOO Main Character Complex
[11:27:26] Downthrower: maybe
[11:27:26] FaahQ2: K, now knows shooting a cop is less charges than theft of one
[11:27:26] EmDuBB13: ya you didnt articulate it for slacks, i swear he just CornWall you
[11:27:27] 1vivy: YEPPPP
[11:27:28] DaZooKidd420: You made this SUPER confusing
[11:27:28] bignasty51: forgot to charge brandishing
[11:27:28] CowWizardMoneyGang: you are a good rper, but people arent willing to give you slack
[11:27:30] Pakkasparkers: Mr K is just annoying
[11:27:30] RedRobo: you operate like a lawyer, not a cop 4Shrug
[11:27:30] geo_logic_: hes mad that a serious charge has serious reprecussions?
[11:27:30] Wallsh_: Slacks is just dense
[11:27:31] skycvg: BINGO
[11:27:33] MahanGM: Duncaning  violence is the inception of everything
[11:27:33] heavyd834: you just need to do it your way without the explanation
[11:27:34] sneakynu: He's just tilted and making silly threats now
[11:27:35] inducedcatharsis: What do you mean by that?
[11:27:36] Vertigo_GG: Thing is you do it the way that involves common sense, others don't
[11:27:36] Zdubs37: Everyone has a different way of comprehending info
[11:27:36] SD_Vortex: Just send him to jail and move on, holy fuck
[11:27:37] SMFTwistedSMF: I think K is going for distance and irritation. How far can I go before this mother fucker snaps... LOL OMEGALAUGHING Clap
[11:27:38] CptTimberwolf: Nah you were fine the issue was Slacks not understanding the charge and talking in front of the perp
[11:27:38] AFellowDegen: it does, K just doesn't care
[11:27:39] daddyhardtears: @trippminds LMAOOOO BRUH
[11:27:39] Spired12: your basically the only one
[11:27:40] 1manpizza: He jumped the gun on starting the talk
[11:27:40] fitzrighthere: You can't fix everything
[11:27:40] Connorbrow: No, you're doing it correctly
[11:27:40] marczm4n: trying to reinvent the wheel
[11:27:41] Zhachi1250: If you rob one cop you get more time/fine then getting caught for shooting like 40+ cops
[11:27:41] DMGcontroll: TBH Cornwood has a tendency to talk in circles, its hard to understand at times from an outsiders perspective
[11:27:42] FaahQ2: you all are screwed
[11:27:43] Orbilion: indeed
[11:27:43] BiZARGoN: its misscommunication
[11:27:43] Grilbur: @warner05 100 percent
[11:27:43] Netopi: It's because slacks took a shortcut
[11:27:44] Shmoopee: I think you explained it to slacks like it was official process. and I think he got defensive @esfandtv
[11:27:44] CowWizardMoneyGang: make cornwood go off the rails
[11:27:45] EmDuBB13: some how yea your right
[11:27:45] 1vivy: YOUR APPROACH IS SOOO DIFF
[11:27:46] RocketMcCoy: Sometimes
[11:27:46] dholdren12: correct everyone has their own thinking
[11:27:47] BigglesVII: No the way you think of it is logical
[11:27:48] soosmaz74: is mr k going to give us his story so u can drop some of the charges
[11:27:48] DismalShark: lawyer and PD meeting needs to happen to clear this stuff out
[11:27:48] Rivath: No it was just one person that didn't get it
[11:27:49] PeculiarEboy: @Kaseyfullofjoy not that I'd want that, but with how upset he is and is specifically targeting cornwood on it I can believe its on sight
[11:27:49] catfish_quackenbush: This is the type of stuff to bring up to Beric, and talk it out. see if this is something to be in a class or something
[11:27:49] keterych: Powerpoint in a meeting NODDERS
[11:27:49] pacifistmasochist: i think you and slacks just have 2 different strategies. he puts all his cards on the table for K which removes all leverage
[11:27:49] AnnoyedWithChat: You were crystal clear bro
[11:27:49] Miterex: No - it's important for the future.
[11:27:52] 360ski: You now how to lawyer now, they don't get it
[11:27:52] Bojabes: It makes sense, it was just a mess at the beginning with explaining. But you are correct imo
[11:27:52] JasonMunday: well it is confusing, cause it's not real
[11:27:53] SantaJerrys: bro mr.k is malding so fucking hard and his voice is DIESOFBEDGE
[11:27:54] KMGP_Outlaw: didn‚Äôt need to summarize everything, K was going to want most of the big hitters dropped anyway @esfandtv
[11:27:55] cleothax: THE WAY YOU WANTED TO DO THIS TO BEGIN W IS ABSOLUTELY THE BEST WAY TO GO ABOUT IT
[11:27:55] phoenixvakarian: you need to invest points into speech
[11:27:55] PowerTurbo: the huge charge makes em mald
[11:27:56] Doqx42: @EsfandTV The only issue is the Cornwood backstory mixed in with the explanation
[11:27:57] Vaddix0056: Write out and SOP on how to do charge someone
[11:27:57] sirachalife: Well according to chat you did everything perfect :)
[11:27:57] iwannanuhh: @EsfandTV the way you do it is the best way, you just need to present it in the appropriate place like a classroom and not during a charge
[11:27:58] Jrey000: you explained it there is not much else you can do
[11:27:58] Zion_Talmer: with respect, it took me until you had the last group session to figure out what you were trying to do
[11:27:58] DaZooKidd420: You made it look like you wanted to press shit just because
[11:27:58] TheDarkNyet: Mr K is also just a professional criminal and knows how to weasel his way out of stuff
[11:27:59] FinnMurtons: all this anti-counsel stuff is making the cantor hit look more like terrorism
[11:27:59] science_envisions: slacks lets the crims interrogate him
[11:27:59] mattchutt: @1manpizza true
[11:28:00] jeremyks9: stupid RP killing laws is what he saying
[11:28:00] deftcg: Write it out @esfandtv
[11:28:01] Tokki_Foolz: thinking like a lawyer not a cop
[11:28:02] Nova_bomb17: slacks come on move on
[11:28:03] millerlight44: he was playing along with the ‚Äúmenu‚Äù rp when you first brought it up.  slacks wanted to do it differently
[11:28:04] BrockLeeSwag: I think too many cooks it becomes too confusing @EsfandTV
[11:28:04] HellaBitter: @EsfandTV time to make a charges flow chart for noobs
[11:28:04] jinnytolls: K is a pro mudslinger and when cops are not alligned with stories and charges; it gives him an in to introduce doubt. That was the biggest mistake here @EsfandTV
[11:28:05] Pakkasparkers: just remove the deal and send him to jail for 3 hours
[11:28:05] scopedin07: it would work but people are not smart enough to get it without an example
[11:28:05] s0ggybreads: pepeW slacks and K talking circles pepeW
[11:28:05] EmDuBB13: idk slacks just cornwalll
[11:28:06] ZuldeadTV: quickly reminder that nekoda understood the picture in like... 5 seconds.
[11:28:08] dapyman: Before interrogation begins, charge plus evidence for each item
[11:28:08] chrisrox22: hes gonna fkn kill them all LUL
[11:28:09] RebornOffline: I understood what you were saying from the start
[11:28:10] TXCVulture: Is your way not tell them everything they can get then work from there?
[11:28:11] MahanGM: Joel
[11:28:11] Gusty331: Thats a talk you should have had after not during the investigation. Its confuses the donfused even more
[11:28:12] ens0mniac: this whole case was literally just slacks rushing shit @esfandtv
[11:28:12] Sweet_BabyJeebus: @EsfandTV you explain it perfectly to chat but not in RP
[11:28:14] rocco244: No your more considerate than anyone
[11:28:14] burlin_: K is just being dense
[11:28:14] heavyd834: I dont think you should explain yourself to the suspects, just the officers
[11:28:16] RexPappa: Funny enough Slacks is a Johnson type, just not as loud. YOu have to be direct with him
[11:28:16] Ross_McD: No, I think K just makes situations hard on purpose, that's his tactic to get out of trouble
[11:28:16] MahanGM: Joel  Looking
[11:28:16] TomatoPhalanges: Your approach is good and correct, but Slack is struggling to grasp what he's actually done vs what you want him to do
[11:28:17] Berserake: make it less confusing by putting it on colored paper and crayons with minimal words
[11:28:19] KaycasTV: where is uzidrews when we need him Smadge
[11:28:20] 360ski: You took both the red and the blue pill LUL LUL LUL
[11:28:20] Connorbrow: @dmgcontroll yeah,he drags things out. Needs to put things in simple short terms
[11:28:21] reesnipe: you just need to get to the point and not ramble too far on about  something when explaining it
[11:28:23] warner05: @grilbur He knows he has at least 3 streams watching, its ridiculous
[11:28:23] Bigeyez: No you're fine but it was just fucked by how it was approached. At this point its too late and it's a shitshow
[11:28:23] ip33fr331y: Genius criminal. Divide and conquer.
[11:28:24] IHavePotential: @EsfandTV you just gotta tell them that you cant negotiate charges til all the charges are there and accounted for
[11:28:26] DjangoMFinUnchained: I havent been following along much, but it seems like Slacks goes in circles a LOT.  For long periods of time
[11:28:27] nlwatcher: you knew the correct way to do it, i just thinking adding it back was a mistake after he was told it wasnt there. The pd had to just live with that mistake
[11:28:27] BlehNation: You do it same way lenny does, present all the potential charges then only press what you want to actually charge them with. Pretty simple <3
[11:28:27] Leafyerick: @EsfandTV Propose dropping the robbery to kidnapping and maybe he'll change his tone
[11:28:29] WiseHealer: It's not the process that is the problem it is the amount of time in jail. There shouldn't be a charge that sends someone to jail for multiple days period.
[11:28:32] antreids: It works, but it was fucked from the beginning. Changing how Slacks did it has now brought us to the situation that you feared. Better to have done it moving forward and not this situation @EsfandTV
[11:28:32] daddyhardtears: @esfandtv  you explained it well that's why every cop besides Slacks understands
[11:28:32] LegitBanana_: https://clips.twitch.tv/ChillyFlirtyAnacondaTheRinger-14KblzDWPQxrmD5P
[11:28:33] Cthyllah: well whats the point of getting the crims and their lawyers to negotiate plea deals if the cops are just going to give it to them outright?
[11:28:36] MarvMelody: reducing so much bc hes crying holy
[11:28:38] 1manpizza: pepeLaugh
[11:28:39] Astral_Rage: No it is very simple. But it's just hard and confusing to change the method part way through.
[11:28:39] Dirtyjim: he‚Äôs going to take it out on the PD and just kill
[11:28:39] Neekapkilla: You just speak open ended and add extra words. 1. Add all charges you have PC for. 2. Explain each charge. 3. Negotiate
[11:28:41] TheSoldier1851: is there a reason he doesn't have a lawyer
[11:28:42] reesnipe: when u explain things there‚Äôs a lot of fluff
[11:28:42] scopedin07: @esfandtv do a example with slacks
[11:28:48] znackpack: ‚ÄúWe‚Äù
[11:28:49] The_Strix01: I think your only problem is you throw in some jokes which takes you off on a tangent from your point some times.
[11:28:50] ssurien: Are there any SOP's on how cops should process crims? If there aren't maybe you can work on that, maybe?
[11:28:50] Shmoopee: I feel like. your method is the unwritten way. and the proper way. but you made it sound like Slacks broke protocols
[11:28:51] DMGcontroll: @Connorbrow exactly, but idk if thats how he wants to play cornwood so it might just be something he has to deal with
[11:28:51] HoeTown: @EsfandTV Slacks doesn't understand that criminals can't read his mind about how generous he is without stating the full charges
[11:28:54] Cecedg125: 10-41
[11:28:54] maestro__21: Slacks is honestly dumb
[11:28:55] Perne78: where does criminal use come from?
[11:28:55] grimmjoww66: damn, if only that charge had been pressed from the start Clueless
[11:28:56] Koolers_Mobile: If your going to try to explain this you need to do it out of rp
[11:28:56] RedRobo: you're trying to practice law instead of simply enforcing it. it complicates the process when people step outside of their roles NODDERS
[11:28:56] maestro__21: Lol
[11:28:56] jeremyks9: or he will quit who knows
[11:28:58] MrActivated: WHAT A SHITSHOW
[11:28:59] EmDuBB13: @Neekapkilla well bull pointed
[11:29:00] soosmaz74: BASED
[11:29:01] BiZARGoN: when i comes down to it Mr K did the crime.
[11:29:02] Zarroc: @esfandtv can't you get him in possession of a PD firearm from the one he used to kidnap you?
[11:29:02] CptTimberwolf: @EsfandTV You're system works fine, just can't talk about that in front of suspects. Slacks could also use a review of the law
[11:29:04] Doqx42: @EsfandTV We need Academy Cornwood to step up for the explanations
[11:29:04] chrisrox22: BASED
[11:29:05] dapyman: Hopefully Slacks is trying to get fired
[11:29:05] Capacchino: .....charges were added during the process?! How is this hard to comprehend.
[11:29:12] FrostwrathAU: Bro this back and forth is giving me a damn headache
[11:29:14] HashtagSoBlessed: This has gone on wayy too long. Charge him and move on

[11:29:15] BattleAlpaca: gotta say more can be removed depending on whats said
[11:29:15] yuudye: Where are the DA's
[11:29:15] Toastbane: This is 2 walls yelling at each other lol
[11:29:16] LHaxorP: it takes more thinking but it shoudl be done that way.... What all happend? What eveidence is there? what Charges does the evidence fit? How well does it fit? then decide what to press........ seems good
[11:29:16] CptTimberwolf: TRUE
[11:29:17] Austin7x3: cornwood caused this though, K understood what you were doing 2 hours ago he just didnt care
[11:29:19] shin5sato3: isn't the EXACT SAME thing that happened with Osvaldo?
[11:29:20] zZEROo77: Deal to remove the robbery and switch it with kidnapping
[11:29:21] Aphotice: feels like friday is gonna be a crazy day
[11:29:21] jinnytolls: 100%
[11:29:21] Nova_bomb17: how many times does slack have to explain the charges. all mr.k does is cry about and argue about it
[11:29:21] EmDuBB13: he CornWall
[11:29:22] Astral_Rage: YES
[11:29:22] Rivath: Yeah Slacks dropped the gun charge for free
[11:29:22] zellitan: xdd five lawyers
[11:29:23] Bear_Otter: Slacks, it's not "probable cause", it's DNA evidence...
[11:29:24] BrockLeeSwag: YEP
[11:29:26] coldan01: xdd
[11:29:28] TheDarkNyet: EXACTLY
[11:29:28] burlin_: slacks is terrible at this
[11:29:28] afghanpsycho: @EsfandTV Sssaab fucked up the entire situation just because he wanted to OOC drop the possession charge
[11:29:28] emery_steele: YEP Û†ÄÄ
[11:29:29] flipperjippy: your strat makes perfect sense but at this point it feels like moving backwards for the defendant @EsfandTV
[11:29:30] PapaPoggo: OK FUCK IT JUST CHARGE HIM FULL ON FUCK HIM
[11:29:31] droksid00: @EsfandTV You need to set up the PD Legal Bootcamp
[11:29:31] bertacharm: Yep
[11:29:31] Espartemos: I feel like the process should be standardized like everything else is. Your way just makes sense from a progression stand point. Know all the things you have then address those things with discretion afterwards. @EsfandTV
[11:29:31] ZuldeadTV: and that's the whole point
[11:29:32] PapaPoggo: lol
[11:29:36] Sweet_BabyJeebus: happened to Cornwood

[11:29:37] bishdaddyfresh_: You need to be really blunt with him about that man
[11:29:38] neighborhoodcapricorn: Public relations would skyrocket if they actually knew
[11:29:38] TheDarkNyet: Slacks is skipping steps
[11:29:39] millerlight44: it‚Äôs like a salesman making discounts with our presenting the full price
[11:29:43] r1bb3t: might need to OOC email ssaab that you want to propose all charges that could potentially be applicable regardless of if they would be dropped or argued against in court for the "full menu".  then propose a deal that drops the charges that could be disputed in court so they get a "deal"
[11:29:46] The_TonyTortelini: K isnt wrong
[11:29:46] jinnytolls: Now that Xavier is on the PD, yall need to do the legal bootcamp @EsfandTV
[11:29:47] MrActivated: xdd
[11:29:47] bertacharm: I said Osvaldo case like an hour ago
[11:29:48] Itz_Slingshot: Mr K has been on this server since 13 people. He is speaking to the limited RP and limitless mechanics crims have to work around
[11:29:49] iwannanuhh: There really needs to be a SOP procedure on how to do this
[11:29:49] RexPappa: propose that to the DOJ, give a sheet to the crims so they can read their charges
[11:29:49] CowWizardMoneyGang: he literally was

[11:29:51] FaahQ2: if the public could read how these charges break down fully. things would be way diff
[11:29:51] chivvyy: xdd
[11:29:54] Rivath: I think it was -120k total
[11:29:56] TheNachoManRandyCabbage: just charge him with all of it and take it to court
[11:29:56] EmDuBB13: at least slacks has your back dude
[11:29:57] vaigreene: @EsfandTV I really respect the way you don't just throw blame at others for not understanding, but instead take a step back and question if you're not explaining things in a way others can understand. Props, Esfand.
[11:29:57] PrettyKrazy: his problem is the time of kidnapping vs murder what
[11:29:57] PowerTurbo: crims expect cops to casually throw around charges
[11:29:59] Kowlineos: The problem that happened is that Slack read mr K charges before they were fully discussed between officers
[11:30:00] marczm4n: understanding slacks position would go a long way for you
[11:30:01] kingkoolkattz: Slacks comms, the order of operations aint there even tho its the same conclusion
[11:30:03] timedoggg: these times and fines are crazy. Clearly nopixel doesn't want any rp that has to do with going after cops
[11:30:06] CowWizardMoneyGang: its insane how mr k is being this way to cornwood who has always tried to help him

[11:30:48] WhoFramedEvident: Isn't the only issue here that Slacks came into the original conversation stating K would have 1k minutes then after talking to everyone it went back to 3k so it makes it seem worse based on the initial conversation? @EsfandTV
[11:30:48] UPRIGHT77: tell him you will see him in civil court too for missed rent payments

[11:32:24] CowWizardMoneyGang: he doesnt deserve cornwoods niceness
[11:32:24] bigdanthegoodsir: he just wants out of the pd at any cost at this point
[11:32:24] amBrint: Dont take it to heart that how K is!
[11:32:25] jinnytolls: At what point does an interegation room even matter. No other criminal is given this much leway to argue their charges before being sent. @EsfandTV
[11:32:25] jawajuice6: esfandL
[11:32:26] SumDee_LumDee: this is why he didn‚Äôt win rp streamer of the year OMEGALUL I‚Äôm kidding

[11:32:29] Lordofstarfall: This isn't RP anymore, he's just throwing a temper tantrum at this point. Starting to feel like the old Nopixel Arma 3 salt rooms Sadge
[11:32:29] Cthyllah: if the cop drops charges for a plea deal before a lawyer even shows up and then the lawyer shows up to get even more charges dropped, the cop isnt gonna drop anything else. the cop shouldnt be doing the job of the lawyer.
[11:32:30] nellethiel_greenleaf: vanill283Jammies

[11:32:37] jaredfranz_: this is what happens when someone gets caught
[11:32:38] afghanpsycho: This is what happens when you are nice to people who dont deserve it, they walk all over you.
[11:32:38] idZach: In this case, personally, I don't think its the case of being generous and K not realizing it, I think Kebun believes he shouldn't be soft banned for multiple days having to sit in prison for doing a roleplay crime and thinks you are the reason more charges were put on him later.  Not saying anything here is right or wrong, its just how I am personally understanding this.
[11:32:39] The_TonyTortelini: W K
[11:32:39] 1manpizza: he never even started the story OMEGALAUGHING

[11:32:53] JayJayMills: why doesn't a prosecutor do this stuff?
[11:32:53] RedRobo: the problem here is you're treating it like an investigation but there's nothing to investigate. there's nothing you need from K to make a deal
[11:32:55] Viske: @s1cKNation That Kebun QQ
[11:32:55] Capacchino: That's what the courts are for though....once the cop has the charges they don't need to investigate more...
[11:32:56] soosmaz74: what is mr k doing now come on man we are trying to wrap it up
[11:32:57] CowWizardMoneyGang: Will cornwood forgive him ever?
[11:32:58] heinousanus95: Hes burning the bridge, let him burn the mufucka! Fuck K
[11:32:59] walnutszs: this is so easy i dont get it literal 25k idiots
[11:33:00] JoshDaDad: this dude has been riding around shooting civs for months with no consequences and it all finally hits him he needs to charge it
[11:33:00] knowlightnofear: There's no fixing this. It's fucked.
[11:33:01] JakeStratic: @EsfandTV You don't get that Mr. K
[11:33:02] RAMEEKILLEDSAMBAAS: Rp denied lol

[11:33:19] kickmaster11: W PD RPing kebunCG
[11:33:19] iwannanuhh: The cops should not be compiling all the charges while they are interrogating, they should walk in with them and immediately start negotiating
[11:33:19] RomanNumera: I'm just gonna say, the way it all went just sucks. I know nobody was trying to fuck anybody over, from K's perspective, it's definitely a bummer and looks terrible.
[11:33:19] jessielight: Mr K has too much control he needs shut down. He shouldn't be calling the shots.
[11:33:20] chops_games: k is over it because hes usually off by midnight texas time. he just wants to go eat irl Sadge
[11:33:22] Slaghammers: Throw the book at him and call it a day....You can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink.

[11:33:24] PsychoJoker: SHITSHOW
[11:33:24] slomojosh: ??????
[11:33:24] Kowlineos: The only two wrong things done in this process, was that Cornwood said the judge name aloud and that the charges were read aloud before they were fully discussed between the officers and finished .
[11:33:25] thenamelessboss: GETOUTTAHERE send it
[11:33:25] antreids: @WhoFramedEvident Yes, exactly. Cornwoods helping should of been for whatever next situation came up, not now.

[11:33:50] TheRealTweex: @EsfandTV Crims have no problem doing the most ridiculous shit and are fine while they are winning. But when they get caught and have to take responsibility they just can't take that L.

[11:38:09] Brakon: I really dont understand how others dont understand cornwood or is it they dont want to understand.
[11:38:09] GlitchyGunZ: in Mr Ks ooc experience it‚Äôs also bad for the deal then adding back and giving a deal to remove it again. @esfandtv agree? slacks should of listened to you man this is on him
[11:38:10] ObscureMyth: just charge him and send him
[11:38:10] Spired12: overcooked
[11:38:12] 360ski: Menace to society, lock him up
[11:38:12] phoenixvakarian: he doesn‚Äôt wanna get out of the hole he‚Äôs in
[11:38:13] JoeSizzle7: Cornwood gave Mr. K all the ammo he needs for questioning charges
[11:38:14] Moregorilla: On the plus side it might help adjust the shooting charges haha
[11:38:15] eyeoin: 3 days is honestly pretty excessive, at the end of a day its a game and this makes him just have to AFK, and also kind of effects his livelihood as a GTA RP streamer

[11:38:43] Mtayh: Mr. K feels like he got robbed of an RP story due to shitty circumstances, and the way the laws are written due to people not truely being murdered when they got downed
[11:38:44] walnutszs: there is no rp here. The pd just issued mr k a 3 day soft ban.
[11:38:44] PrettyKrazy: is that his problem?
[11:38:45] Clear_96: BASED flop

[11:38:58] GLSMarbles: @jinnytolls AMEN
[11:38:59] Tyconim: I feel like this developpement in motivation for Cornwood is great, making sure that everything is done right and correct does fit his character. Maybe Cornwood can explain his reasoning in a meeting with Slacks and other people to try to find a solution and change the way the PD processes pcrims.
[11:39:00] SantaJerrys: GETALIFE GET RID OF HIM
[11:39:00] Lowkey_RP: I'd slap him with criminal/terrorism threats. Keeps repeating he's going to shoot up everyone.
[11:39:00] Capacchino: In what way?
[11:39:00] JakeStratic: You're projecting. This isn't a bad experience. This is a Mr. K & Ramee not wanting to be charged experience @EsfandTV ... This is Mr. K's character, he refuses to be charged
[11:39:01] nekodon1: no its gonna come back on Slacks

[11:39:09] 1manpizza: started negotiating a plea deal before the charges were in order
[11:39:09] RomanNumera: Ssaab didn't understand what you were saying and this went so bad from there.
[11:39:10] maestro__21: You shouldnt have to try to add it after the fact

[11:39:12] droksid00: please don't let PD morale go away because of this
[11:39:13] mruniverse616: just admit ok a deal is off the table at this point and hit him with all youve got hes messing with you guys from the get go
[11:39:15] walnutszs: the justice department stripes the entire rp out of the sitatuion because they use it to moderate the city its fucking stupid af and thats why nopixel blows
[11:39:15] FaahQ2: Officer flip Flop's case is known by K, will be brought up in court

[11:39:15] Grilbur: Well it wasn't incorrect, it just wasn't how you like it
[11:39:16] slomojosh: @nekodon1 it‚Äôs not. Cornwood is going to be targeted now.
[11:39:19] RexPappa: Classic Slacks, "I dont want this to happen, but I will take every action that will probably result in that exact scenario"
[11:39:20] phaden_: I can't get over the fact that people are so pressed they use channel points to get up about a game. kekw
[11:39:21] s0ggybreads: he gave him a deal without telling him he was giving him a deal
[11:39:21] TarvusPlz: @jeremyks9 you are right. If crime is good RP, then you should be let free. Can't wait to see how that flies with other crims

[11:39:32] GlitchyGunZ: @romannumera yup pd needs to take this one on the chin for their mess up
[11:39:33] MadderHatter: Mr K helped cause the chaos by not letting you all hash out the charges before talking with him
[11:39:34] maestro__21: Well it was too late

[11:41:24] HellaBitter: LASO now
[11:41:26] GlitchyGunZ: do you see how it‚Äôs messed up to not honor the initial stuff slacks proposed then add back on? @esfandtv slacks wanted to switch robbery to kidnapping and go down from it. I see both sides
[11:41:29] ben_v_art: Classic
[11:41:31] FaahQ2: 400k in lockpicks, while in jail. and has 11 guns when he out. all cops on this are screwed

[11:41:36] EmDuBB13: kit was right the other day when she said pd needs to slow down

[11:41:44] PowerTurbo: sounds like slacks should get demoted for this LUL LUL LUL LUL
[11:41:47] BigglesVII: TBF he went on a crime spree and got caught.
[11:41:48] GILx87: Slacks needs a DAP for this. He jumped the gun and let this get out of hand
[11:41:50] TimmayHS: Slacks is a masochist. That's what I learned today.
[11:41:51] bb_woo: Yea this is classic Mr k he plays it so good üëèüòé
[11:41:52] iwannanuhh: @EmDuBB13 hes a crime lord living in a delusion that he is a legal business man
[11:41:52] WiseHealer: Maybe there shouldn't be a 3 day jail time charge
[11:41:54] BrockLeeSwag: he just wants to be sent

[11:41:57] Raja_Banhammer: @walnutszs i mean this isnt one incident its like 5-6. although i agree 3 days is maybe too much
[11:41:58] madhatterui: do the crime, do the time

[11:42:16] biffster42: You lost Slacks when you started talking about the future shit. Gotta stick to the point and how things would remain advantageous to K but still get a plea

[11:42:17] EmDuBB13: @iwannanuhh i didnt think anyone could be more annoying then ramee
[11:42:24] GlitchyGunZ: he shouldn‚Äôt of got listed charges without possession and told that you couldn‚Äôt charge it today then be told you can an hour later. that‚Äôs scuffed @esfandtv am I crazy
[11:42:25] RietArtwork: YEP
[11:42:28] Zolothan: the hard truth is you were wrong to care that much about the process at the expense of all other considerations, you're a bunch of entertainers FIRST

[11:42:36] phaden_: @FaahQ2 @Toyola the duality of man kekw

[11:42:42] SavageTarzan: Classic
[11:42:42] AndHaka54: but that was only case cause you made him change things and put charge back on
[11:42:42] Inz4ne_: then you should drop the "we did this wrong" until he is out of jail
[11:42:44] RAMEEKILLEDSAMBAAS: @emdubb13 you right?
[11:42:46] Wynter282: you did make him go back in with the correct charges i think it would have been better to just leave it at that point
[11:42:54] eyeoin: 3 irl days is just too long for any charge in a game.
[11:42:54] revanthebetrayer: the RP drama of the hot gun gets overshadowed because the cahrges for kidnapping are so inflated in comparison.
[11:42:54] Diamondman121314: As much as I agree with your charges, it might be best to go with the initial charges
[11:42:55] TheLastRace: @EsfandTV Probably best to not hand out deals unless a lawyer is present for the defense
[11:42:56] searlesbarkleyk: Uhh Flop lol?
[11:42:56] twirlyD: Slacks was taking off charges before negotiating which means they have less to negotiate with later.

[11:42:59] EmDuBB13: @FaahQ2 i know i mean ramee's charecter when he was lawyering
[11:42:59] Leafyerick: Maybe he shouldn't have kidnapped Cornwood with a molten hot gun in front of a downed officer and EMS shyyShrug
[11:43:00] BBCapitalist: you caused it by forcing it though
[11:43:02] GlitchyGunZ: this is what you wanted to avoid man. you are 100% correct and predicted this @esfandtv
[11:43:03] nlwatcher: You say that, but you were the one who pushed to add the charges after
[11:43:04] phaden_: essaying lookUp
[11:43:04] MrPRINCE______: your suggestion to let him go for now is actually smart tho @EsfandTV
[11:43:07] Smash388: @esfandtv I feel like there was a combination of Slacks not understanding your process, but maybe more that he did not initially agree with the possession charge
[11:43:07] BBCapitalist: you shouldve talked to slacks about it afterwards
[11:43:08] xblasphemye: 154k almost pays cornwood back

[11:43:09] walnutszs: who cares. the incidents lead to ROLE PLAY, its a RP server. You dont soft ban RP its dumb af
[11:43:10] ZuldeadTV: he's mad because from his point of view, it feels like they added charges just to take it off and call it a deal
[11:43:10] xblasphemye: nice
[11:43:11] ElDRojo: essaying
[11:43:11] MrActivated: xdd u called it and it manifaested itself
[11:43:12] marczm4n: but once it doesn‚Äôt happen, the situation needs to move on, no? not hammering your point
[11:43:13] yeaimhere: L cops
[11:43:14] TimmayHS: anytime slacks is involved in something complex like this, leave immediately
[11:43:15] ty_136: Honestly your suggestion about having officers shadow a legal aid or lawyer is a good idea tbh
[11:43:16] ZuldeadTV: when the charges were there from the beginning
[11:43:16] nocherlas: live and learn
[11:43:18] MadderHatter: cause he was trying to cause this exact problem
[11:43:18] hastyj22: but Mr K is still trying to get more charges dropped without saying anything about the incidents too
[11:43:19] CptTimberwolf: Slacks He knows he's guilty probably KEKW
[11:43:19] roshamb09: it'll lead to some rp anyways
[11:43:20] Spired12: and now slacks billed and gets the cut lol
[11:43:21] karaskyee: i thought that was weird too
[11:43:21] 1manpizza: xdd cause Mr K knows Slacks
[11:43:22] antreids: But then everyone agreeing to move forward to retract everything is also bad. Should of just been done next time cuz it was already fucked @EsfandTV
[11:43:22] djhyzel78: he wanted to rp it
[11:43:22] quaylewastaken: Rip
[11:43:24] Dathmaker3: this may make k move to a new server
[11:43:24] jinnytolls: Arguing infront of K was the real problem @EsfandTV Should have sidebarred from the beginning
[11:43:24] RedRobo: he didn't ask for a lawyer because he knows yall let him go for shit LUL
[11:43:24] Kowlineos: Esfand, just tell Saab to press all the charges, things went the wrong way now and there is no way this is going to the way the we all wanted, best to save time e finish all of this.
[11:43:24] dm0d: L cops
[11:43:24] MinotaurFluff: We needed a prosecco too
[11:43:24] BigglesVII: @capacchino Now it's just damage control, when he gets out he will spend a week killing everyone again üòÇ
[11:43:26] walnutszs: get him off the server for the night, get a guilty plea and move the fuck on
[11:43:27] RomanNumera: Jesus, he's actually getting the full 2 days after all that, too..
[11:43:27] Shakalakin: Who's ready for the next 3 hour talk post this?? LUL
[11:43:27] soosmaz74: LUL
[11:43:27] Oreo3295: just go patrol with bay and call it a day
[11:43:27] FaahQ2: why need one, he knew he would get the shaft
[11:43:28] Netopi: all of this shitshow because of that black buffalo LUL
[11:43:28] Exotic_Soul: cus he was already pissed off when he heard there were reports tied to his gun
[11:43:29] Capacchino: Because he wants to be a shitlord lol..that's his character
[11:43:29] TheLastRace: He didnt ask because he knew he could weasle his way through
[11:43:30] shin5sato3: this is a SHITSHOW if I've ever seen one
[11:43:32] Ciefon: @nlwatcher another one who's not listening to what cornwood said
[11:43:33] searlesbarkleyk: yeah shoulda just brought up it after this was over
[11:43:34] destinygun: I'm sorry it Slacks fault
[11:43:34] driver1036: You were also a victim so could've recused yourself
[11:43:35] Mouso9: Was k's DNA on the hot gun? From the plant
[11:43:35] iwannanuhh: You should propose teaching an interrogation class and establish a SOP for this
[11:43:35] Cthyllah: the only lawyer that would have helped him doesnt have his bar license right now lmaoo
[11:43:36] PWRslide2: gotta say, anything Mr K and Ramee gets involved with these days simply just gets annoying
[11:43:37] MinotaurFluff: Prosecutor*
[11:43:39] roshamb09: this is clearly both frustrating and entertaining
[11:43:39] JasonMunday: Slacks EZ $23k commission
[11:43:41] Gusty331: Should have talk about it after, not during
[11:43:41] JakeStratic: You're mistaken that you think Mr. K would have been happy with any charges @EsfandTV
[11:43:41] soosmaz74: I THINK U STILL CAN SAVE THIS
[11:43:41] Ruttiger64: Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 All this and nobody even mirandized him
[11:43:42] RomanNumera: He got all of it
[11:43:44] GlitchyGunZ: At the end of the day you‚Äôre right and slacks didn‚Äôt follow your lead. @esfandtv
[11:43:45] marczm4n: it‚Äôs a learning situation for all
[11:43:46] Aphotice: he didnt ask for a lawyer, he said he didnt want one
[11:43:47] BBCapitalist: damn k is gonna stalk tf out of you now :(
[11:43:50] RicoLoco52: he thought he would bargain for   a lesser sentence and expunge, probably.
[11:43:50] MarvMelody: just give him the nines and send him up, hes making shit hard for everyone . let him cry BabyRage  Û†ÄÄ
[11:43:51] Toastbane: Flops didn't hear the part where they'd drop PD gun for the details on all the other cases
[11:43:52] FaahQ2: she never heard that story. she said a PD gun possession is all that matters
[11:43:55] Ruttiger64: Kappa
[11:43:56] coldan01: @Ruttiger64, xdd
[11:43:56] ZuldeadTV: he got all of it? daaaamn
[11:43:56] ItsEdBoi_: You forced the proper procedure to make a point and u fucked over K, it is what it is, thats what happened
[11:43:57] aussie_herobrine: well better always have your gun out in 2800 minutes
[11:43:59] roshamb09: @BBCapitalist, that could be really funny lol
[11:43:59] MarcoCB_: the whole thing is just in bad faith at this point
[11:43:59] ThronDon: think best thing to do is walk away from it and chalk it up to mistakes and move forward from it
[11:44:00] EmDuBB13: let his whiny ass go and deal with it in court EZ
[11:44:02] BrockLeeSwag: KEKW wasnt mirandized hes free
[11:44:03] ScoutRacing: LASO NOWW
[11:44:03] MrPRINCE______: what a freaked up situation

[11:44:25] Lite_Ice: who cares
[11:44:25] StreamElements: Post top tier content to my subreddit https://reddit.com/r/esfandtv
[11:44:27] DiscretionaI: Why did he attempt this? He‚Äôs taken this a bit far due to the consequences of being caught
[11:44:27] staynsalty: get Xavier to prosecute
[11:44:27] ncs_310: fight what? LUL
[11:44:28] Moregorilla: Slacks thought he did it by mentioning the fact he was not going to push the gun charge at the start.. and didn't understand the difference at what you tired to say and Slacks thought you wanted to charge the gun charge and not offer a deal to remove it
[11:44:29] kylef_: so dumb
[11:44:29] JO3Y_C: Scuffed
[11:44:29] walnutszs: he wasnt shitlording, he was roleplaying, had a whole thing planned out. you dont punish roleplay. If someone is driving up taking the cops shit for no reason or whatever becuase he is just a shitlord, then you fuck him but thats not it
[11:44:32] energizergeyser: @EsfandTV dont listen to these angry chatters, us that have brains know it wasnt your fault you have nothing to be sorry for
[11:44:33] Craxxbones: The sigh lol
[11:44:33] Pinteger: I hate saying this but it seems like K was pissed OOC, which led to him saying I don't care, not asking for a lawyer, and then Slacks sensing that and rushing it a bit
[11:44:36] PURP__x: you tried man gg's
[11:44:36] soosmaz74: DAMN SO HE CANT STREAM FOR TWO DAYS
[11:44:36] RedRobo: good, let him fight it. that's the system. cops enforce the law, justice system assesses its application
[11:44:37] HoeTown: OKEY
[11:44:37] BBCapitalist: @roshamb09 it's gonna be good rp for sure but a potentially frustrating situation for someone lol
[11:44:37] AFellowDegen: nice easy 4 hours worth of PAY!
[11:44:42] imfukinlost: that should have all been done before questioning lol
[11:44:43] MrBASins: ITs over 2+ hours later???
[11:44:45] ScoutRacing: PUT ON DARK WOOD
[11:44:45] Radk1lla: ooooof
[11:44:46] Vikairius: Homie gonna make bank in jail
[11:44:46] SumDee_LumDee: FF7 TOMORROW WOOOOOOO LETS FUCKING GO
[11:44:46] walnutszs: I KNOW YOU DO ESFAND
[11:44:47] oofinside: bring bay, she also stressed out LULE
[11:44:50] BigglesVII: Did he get sent up for the possession too? He won't get away with that with the judges lol
[11:44:54] quaylewastaken: Anyone over ,3 hr is ridiculous
[11:44:56] Brakon: People already coming here to play the blame game
[11:45:01] Maz0hyst: Cornwood was trying to make sure the charges given were correct and K wasn't getting stacked or undercharged. What shouldn't have happened was them discussing bullshit in front of K and throwing X and removing Y. It should've been handled in the hallway, then the deal could've been made. If something was fucked it should've been fixed after the fact and used as a teaching experience. essaying
[11:45:02] Grilbur: I mean, just because he rpd it doesn't mean no consequence
[11:45:02] judgement_12: Slacks just messed up and charged him off the dummy incident...
[11:45:03] Jammer724: i think this all stems from the fact that the old PDs place can't be signed out at
[11:45:03] walnutszs: people in the both chats do not get it
[11:45:04] sevenonesmith: damn 3 days
[11:45:04] Radk1lla: this is a pd L bro
[11:45:06] reverseplatypus: rip turbos
[11:45:07] droksid00: Mr K is a genius. The PD was too happy. He's now pissed them all off and ruined morale. 5D Chess
[11:45:07] BigCumulonimbus: We gotta move on
[11:45:08] Kowlineos: Now is time for the paperwork
[11:45:12] SumDee_LumDee: FF7 TOMORROW WOOOOOOO LETS FUCKING GO REBIRTH IS BACK BABY LETSGOOO
[11:45:12] RocketMcCoy: Should have never mentioned the PD gun PEPW
[11:45:13] RerQ: Don't wanna go to jail, don't do the crime LUL
[11:45:15] JakeStratic: @Raja_Banhammer Yes, it is his nature as a crim. Cops trying to placate him is some odd projection... Mr. K is aggro PERIOD
[11:45:16] RedRobo: so the cops cant play their roles?
[11:45:17] GlitchyGunZ: nobody listens to Cornwood. he was right. he has the bar license. slacks jumped the gun and spoke too soon @esfandtv
[11:45:18] geo_logic_: pulled aggro Sadge
[11:45:18] Connor_ND_Lover: you are playing good guy but just got him lock up for 3 days and $100k fine
[11:45:19] jinnytolls: @Maz0hyst Agreed 100%
[11:45:20] BigCumulonimbus: Get your evidence together
[11:45:21] MTNPitchBlack: my mom made me blueberry muffins
[11:45:21] shamison1: NGL K Does this everytime he gets caught...
[11:45:24] StevenB79: taunt failed
[11:45:25] Toastedgamer03: now paperwork time Deadge
[11:45:26] jeremyks9: anyone who thinks 3 days in prison is good for RP just bad rp
[11:45:27] UpsideDownAce: Can you even be involved as the victim of the sceen?
[11:45:28] AnnoyedWithChat: Next time let Slacks keep Slackin' LUL
[11:45:28] RietArtwork: We agree, lets move on please Prayge
[11:45:28] searlesbarkleyk: Yeah probably shoulda held tongue lol :P
[11:45:30] Spired12: being a lawyer for a week should be a requirement to join pd
[11:45:30] Vertigo_GG: Yesterday was too good to be true. Something like this was bound to happen
[11:45:30] RomanNumera: It's just kind of wild that all of that misunderstanding led to double the time and fine.
[11:45:31] CowWizardMoneyGang: you gave your good faith to someone that didnt want it
[11:45:31] FaahQ2: 4.0 about to have PD wipes way sooner than thought.
[11:45:31] Radk1lla: PD got the W but RP wise its an L on the server
[11:45:32] SumDee_LumDee: it‚Äôs cringe
[11:45:32] k9_goliath: let some dogs lie
[11:45:32] walnutszs: well hes aggresive cuz hes getting banned for 3 days with 0 possible jail roleplay, youd be pissed too.
[11:45:32] Shakeboxing: Put him up there for 14 days to rethink his position @EsfandTV :D
[11:45:33] jinnytolls: Next time, take the convo outside of where the crim is @EsfandTV
[11:45:34] PeculiarEboy: It's more annoying that the heat went onto cornwood is going to get targeted now because of the problems other people made
[11:45:34] PWRslide2: too many Chefs.
[11:45:34] WiseHealer: Copixel strikes again!
[11:45:35] MrPRINCE______: everyone made mistakes gotta move on and keep morale up
[11:45:36] Toastbane: You and Slacks shouldn't be involved with K processing anymore
[11:45:38] maestro__21: You shouldn't have after they proposed the initial charge
[11:45:38] nlwatcher: its all good. The drama is what hooks us in.
[11:45:38] MrActivated: The joke of PD Sadge
[11:45:38] Aphotice: its just a dumb circumstance that snowballed
[11:45:38] RerQ: Why not?
[11:45:39] Raja_Banhammer: 3 days is too much
[11:45:39] williamwildcat: 3 day soft ban is fun
[11:45:40] JasonMunday: whatever, he chose it
[11:45:40] sendemup: i do :)
[11:45:41] scopedin07: just bet the statement done at this point
[11:45:42] BruBru561: stand up for what you believe in to slack or whoever @esfandtv
[11:45:42] revanthebetrayer: don't you think even the RP of the hot gun after capture is overshadowed by the 2 days of jailtime too?
[11:45:43] KGKN_007: @RerQ yea everyone should do sanitation or groupe6. nice one
[11:45:43] TheLastRace: @EsfandTV you were the victim so at that point you were conflicted as an officer
[11:45:44] XtraMedium1301: XtraMedium1301 subscribed with Prime. 
[11:45:44] jessielight: he sews discord as a distraction
[11:45:44] kevwiches: his chat is insane though good lord
[11:45:44] Deathwound: Soft ban for a robbery is crazy. Can shot 20 people and get the same time
[11:45:45] sevenonesmith: mistake row pd
[11:45:47] BigCumulonimbus: GET YOUR EVIDENCE SQUARED AWAY
[11:45:47] CowWizardMoneyGang: oh well he wouldnt work with you so its his fault
[11:45:47] Sweet_BabyJeebus: that's the rules though
[11:45:47] shamison1: Neither do i, but if you do the crime, dont be salty when you get caught.
[11:45:47] ArtificialHelix: It can be content with the Wardens
[11:45:47] mikkelite: he was being stubborn and not making a deal
[11:45:48] Hawaiianbreado: how long is 3 days in game?
[11:45:48] CptTimberwolf: The time on that is insane
[11:45:48] quaylewastaken: 3 days for drug trafficking
[11:45:48] Capacchino: If the crime fits why not?
[11:45:48] BruBru561: BruBru561 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! :)
[11:45:49] khrow: yeah prob should have saved that for another discussion instead of RIGHT THEN IN INTERRROGATION
[11:45:49] Vikairius: Prison is the real heist honestly
[11:45:49] Perne78: he has literally only ever been caught twice lol... wtf is that guy talking about
[11:45:49] ElDRojo: W tizz
[11:45:50] korgx15: then don't do the crime LUL. or at least come up with a better plan
[11:45:50] RexPappa: He can hang out with Bobby though
[11:45:50] SmugPls: dont get caught Shruge
[11:45:51] afghanpsycho: He literally baby rages every time he gets caught
[11:45:51] Abduleon_: ok but tbf tho
[11:45:51] Sairaph117: This doesn't feel like RP, this feels like Esfand and Saab trying to take care of Kevin.
[11:45:51] PrettyKrazy: then dont push the charges?
[11:45:51] salvi9: I really do feel the character slacks dropped the ball by talking about the charges before it was it settled
[11:45:51] GLSMarbles: This sucks for K but it can be the thing that makes sure cops never do this again
[11:45:51] Gusty331: @GlitchyGunZ shouldnt have been involved during. Should have talk about all the process and everything after
[11:45:51] condor2104: he did it to himself
[11:45:52] ooCORSAIRoo: yall put a guy in 20+. the hell you talking about

[11:45:55] tarzandaking: No you right they should have layed out all the charges first
[11:45:55] Dirtyjim: Cornwood 3 days is great! do you understand what he does
[11:45:56] ZuldeadTV: to be fair slacks tried hard to get a deal, but the beans were all spilled
[11:45:56] Grilbur: Meh, he can prison rp, and he never had to do the crime
[11:45:56] shr00mz_09: give him time to play rebirth
[11:45:56] UA_Shark: don‚Äôt do 3 days worth of crime
[11:45:57] Toastedgamer03: @Hawaiianbreado 3 days
[11:45:57] streaker85: he‚Äôs gonna be so buff
[11:45:58] williamwildcat: its so fun to RP for 3 days in a prison with nobody there and nothing to do on an RP server
[11:45:58] lepacaJQ: dont want 3 days, dont use the hottest gun on the planet LUL
[11:45:58] PicklemanJaro: He usually gets mad anyway and hoppers always rush
[11:45:59] kowalskithegreat: COPS W'S IN THE CHAT BOYS 3 DAYS LETS GOOOOO
[11:45:59] GorSTL: he did 3 days work of crime though. He just wasn't caught yet
[11:45:59] EmDuBB13: cleetus literally said cut him lose kekw

[11:46:02] bb_woo: That's a lot a days with prison rp lol üòµ
[11:46:02] Connor_ND_Lover: crazy
[11:46:03] antreids: Thats not a problem you can solve mid sentencing though. The charges are what they are sadly
[11:46:03] PsychoJoker: so essentially K got a soft ban FailFish
[11:46:04] philshiftley: thats pretty much his arguement is 3 days in jail is actually insane
[11:46:04] 1vivy: I think this is also a let 1 door deal with the interrogation
[11:46:04] minothorx: 3 Days ouch
[11:46:06] Shakeboxing: He'll make a heap of $$$ while there for lock picking tho :D
[11:46:09] myrn9: I feel like if it was Friday it would be easier, he doesn't usually play Saturday Sunday.
[11:46:09] Viske: 3 DAYS GET FUCKED EZ
[11:46:11] DeeJayD1: You did the right thing by sticking to your morals. That is all a man can do.
[11:46:11] ObscureMyth: he earned 3 days
[11:46:11] jessielight: isnt bobby charles just going to let him out anyway?
[11:46:11] KevinnTCG: @EsfandTV He has robbed over 6 cops and stolen many turbos without getting caught, time might be a lot but it is not that imbalanced.
[11:46:11] Honorspren: its 2 days. 2800 mins is 46 hours
[11:46:12] Inz4ne_: @EsfandTV I might be wrong on this, why is it so big of deal the sit for a couple days tho? his content literally revolves entirely around the craziest crim stuff?
[11:46:13] RicoLoco52: how does it work with him pleading not guilty?
[11:46:13] DaZooKidd420: This is going to be a shit show now. ooc it's crazy knowing that all he was trying to do was make RP and didn't rob you and shit but now it's going to make it worse for you
[11:46:14] SmugPls: 3 days to get back more than he was charged LUL
[11:46:14] Kolipto: Can there ever be an OOC break for this stuff?
[11:46:14] DEANCUH: he gets away with so much.... he does always do stuff like this when he finally gets caught
[11:46:14] i2_I_S_IE: cops are all fucked gready mf
[11:46:15] Leafyerick: LMAO actually insane if you think Esfand feels like he got a W here
[11:46:15] dapyman: Not a nice try at all
[11:46:15] AlindBack: If K doesn't go down occasionally like this, then the charges will just stack worse and he'll be charged for 2+ weeks at a go.
[11:46:16] kylef_: 3 IRL days is dumb
[11:46:16] Lowkey_RP: I would normally agree, but Mr K robs literally everyone he sees. And cries everytime something bad happens to him.
[11:46:16] TheMah1337: he had the choice to take the deal he was being petty
[11:46:17] chivvyy: the sentence was 46.6 hours in the end
[11:46:19] ExpedientMiner: ALL COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED WITH A FUNCTIONING LITTLE ALAMO
[11:46:20] jeremyks9: game is called GTA criminals give cops stuff to do just too serious
[11:46:21] chops_games: @EsfandTV joke about the commission on that charge Kappa
[11:46:21] BigglesVII: It's good learning for everyone involved.
[11:46:22] Cthyllah: so just put more crims in prison so he has more people to rp with, ez
[11:46:22] hastyj22: Mr k acting like robbing or killing cops is a normal thing and shouldnt be fairly punished
[11:46:23] staynsalty: then don‚Äôt rob a cop while a cop has broken legs from a black or grey buffalo lol
[11:46:24] Kiyoni: hindsight 20/20? SLACKS CORNWOOD told you from the start, it shouldn't have been "hindsight"
[11:46:25] Toastedgamer03: duncan worried about the budget GIGACHAD
[11:46:25] Grallus: Hindsight is 20/20 when you don't listen to the person telling you how to do it right as it's happening.
[11:46:25] 1manpizza: Slacks should really wait to do interrogations next time LULE
[11:46:25] Doqx42: Go free for a week it all adds up....
[11:46:26] sendemup: 3 days is LITERALLY NOTHING compared to deans punishment for 10 daps, GET REAL
[11:46:27] TimmayHS: I think Cornwood should get a 3 day vacation
[11:46:27] JasonMunday: so was 60 day DAPS but it is what it is
[11:46:28] droksid00: @lepacaJQ yeah tf? who is dumb enough to use the same gun over and over again. like, you stole 35 PD guns use those
[11:46:28] Kaseyfullofjoy: how long is 3 days IRL?
[11:46:29] Chaoszero_goc: then you should have dropped the charge?
[11:46:30] SaRAWRuby: :3
[11:46:30] Radk1lla: Its an L on the server cause Kebun is the best roleplayer around...he will make RP out of it but its an L for the server to have him in jail this long
[11:46:30] AardvarkAndDedication: Duncan OMEGALAUGHING \
[11:46:31] Ciefon: @philshiftley he doesn't want 3 days but also don't want to negotiate, how does that work
[11:46:32] Shakeboxing: Send him up there for 21 days f it
[11:46:33] DaZooKidd420: 3 days is crazy NGL
[11:46:33] iwannanuhh: IMO I think the NoPixel admins need to make a decision about the type of server this is... If its a content server then the PD needs to be on board for that and stop trying to run a hyper real serious pd
[11:46:33] HeyMeghan: no. it‚Äôs not your fault he refused to listen. it‚Äôs frustrating when someone doesn‚Äôt listen to you. your frustration is valid dude.
[11:46:34] canadianfitty: exactly 3 day is alot when your literal real job is to stream this exact game every day . i understand  the rp but the time behind bars for real life seems unjust
[11:46:35] Triist0ne: bro had a molten hot gun bro
[11:46:36] Dirtyjim: a hot gun, killings, robbing.
[11:46:36] loiares: 1 day is too long
[11:46:37] mikkelite: he could of plead down
[11:46:37] Grilbur: He could've still made a deal though
[11:46:38] Sairaph117: Your "job" isn't to decide if it's dumb or not. :P
[11:46:39] jbc_inc: Hindsight is 20-20 but you had someone at the time telling you the right thing to do....
[11:46:39] Saucebauc3: @sendemup delusional
[11:46:40] CptTimberwolf: Agreed, the fine is already massive
[11:46:41] coldan01: there should be bail, he def can afford it
[11:46:42] JasonMunday: both absurd
[11:46:45] ZuldeadTV: yeah it's true af
[11:46:47] RomanNumera: And Dean could still RP with people during.
[11:46:48] KYslippy: we gonna learn don't mess with Cornwood's guns or turbos LUL
[11:46:49] Wallsh_: DON'T DO CRIME
[11:46:49] GlitchyGunZ: @inz4ne_ it wouldn‚Äôt be bad if there was correctional officers but rp is tough 3 days with no interaction with anyone
[11:46:49] KMGP_Outlaw: three days is the dumbest
[11:46:49] kylef_: thats just whataboutism lol
[11:46:49] BigglesVII: Save the prison busses üòÇ
[11:46:51] BigCumulonimbus: DON‚ÄôT FORGET TO EVIDENCE LOCKER YOUR STUFF
[11:46:52] wildboy789789: 2 wrongs dont make a left
[11:46:52] AlexSamaAU: tbf thats crimes spanning over weeks, so why is it too long if he was caught at the time itd just be same time spread out
[11:46:52] Alexpcorbin: It sounds like everyone needed to be on the same page when interrogating K, was just a shitshow of everyone coming up with solutions their own way while in the interrogation room, not a good look.
[11:46:52] walnutszs: if hes a shit lord sure, but Kebun is not a shitlord. You use the DOJ to moderate the shit lords and you reward the role players. You say hey here is your charges, plead guilty give us the story and take 3 hours in bolingbrooke and reserve the right to charge him later if he keeps doing it
[11:46:53] PrettyKrazy: why compare those completely different things
[11:46:54] PWRslide2: If there were more people in jail he could have a cooler arc in jail lol
[11:46:55] sevenonesmith: dean didn‚Äôt have to sit in jail with no one there
[11:46:57] ScoutRacing: PRISON RP ISNT FUN THERES NO CONTENT
[11:46:57] KMGP_Outlaw: K just got buried
[11:46:57] ZuldeadTV: dean was "jailed" for a month that was insane
[11:46:57] khrow: Banned a guy for trying to make fun kidnapping RP with other people
[11:46:59] marczm4n: why didn‚Äôt slacks assert rank?
[11:47:00] HoeTown: the possession charge is way overblown in both time and money
[11:47:00] colinax: why can we send msgs shittalking in subonly mode LUL
[11:47:01] Shakeboxing: BURY HIM UNDER THE PRISON
[11:47:01] Dirtyjim: he had a molten hot gun.
[11:47:01] HellaBitter: 3 days messes with his irl money too, hard to RP in prison
[11:47:02] myrn9: No raid?
[11:47:04] walnutszs: just because one thing is dumb chat doesnt justify another dumb thing
[11:47:04] SumDee_LumDee: FF7 TOMORROW WOOOOOOO LETS FUCKING GO REBIRTH IS BACK BABY LETSGOOO
[11:47:05] SaRAWRuby: oh no not the daps SADGE
[11:47:08] MrActivated: GETALIFE GIVE SLACKS A DAP
[11:47:08] JustJoshinYa2: I love how 4.0 literally promised this kind of thing wouldn't happen and now we just watched K get 3 days for kidnapping a cop
[11:47:09] Perne78: you got called out about daps for being whiny and wrong so don't bring that up in defense lol
[11:47:10] 1vivy: is prison time counted logged out?
[11:47:12] Trae618: RP SERVER BTW CHASING W'S
[11:47:13] searlesbarkleyk: I mean without him giving the stuff back it's a bit much to complain about possession regardless of intent
[11:47:13] bb_woo: It is just rp not like he power games or something üòµ
[11:47:15] jeremyks9: MR k is stuck in prison dean could still RP like cornwood did
[11:47:15] Axcennts: 2800 minutes is 2 days stop saying 3 lol
[11:47:18] shamison1: The fact hes flaming you all OOC is so uncalled for...
[11:47:20] ElDRojo: @SumDee_LumDee COPEFAND Copeless
[11:47:20] Viske: @ScoutRacing don't get caught then EZ
[11:47:20] The_Strix01: Have you tried a desk pop?
[11:47:20] x_juiceman: Prison RP is too trash  to be forced into for 3 days
[11:47:21] GlitchyGunZ: you think he would of got away with it if you were able to go off duty at sheriffs office? @esfandtv
[11:47:21] JasonMunday: DON'T DISCOUNT GOOD PRISON RP
[11:47:23] AlexSamaAU: tbf that was crimes spanning over weeks, so why is it too long if he was caught at the time itd just be same time spread out
[11:47:23] Sweet_BabyJeebus: all this drama comes from arguing with the server rules though
[11:47:25] ComradeGreetingCard: just need to go to chief and establish SOP for cell processing
[11:47:25] jdotno: you missed out on some great RP with that kidnapping though
[11:47:26] williamwildcat: whats the difference between you calling a judge to find charges and slacks calling a lawyer to press murder charges on you
[11:47:26] ZuldeadTV: yeah
[11:47:27] Kolipto: Are there any OOC moments to talk about this?
[11:47:27] sircrumpler: In game year LUL
[11:47:28] Potato_Nation19: He had a choice.... he made it, tough shit
[11:47:29] Dirtyjim: Justin kidd 21 days
[11:47:29] sendemup: 
[11:47:29] time4sleep: @EsfandTV believe in yourself <3 You now your character, and what you believe is right.
[11:47:31] RomanNumera: @shamison1 he's not
[11:47:33] XtraMedium1301: Slacks needs retraining. end of story.
[11:47:34] toaster_strudes: Just make a maximum sentance time unless it's a H.U.T.
[11:47:34] KMGP_Outlaw: no prison RP either
[11:47:36] RedRobo: "if he keeps doing it" is wild when he just had to go for a pardon literally yesterday and got caught with a gun tied to multiple other incidents LUL
[11:47:37] icrlym: I kind of view how you want to do things like a receipt you see the charges you see the total amount then from there you‚Äôll see any discounts and the cost after those discounts
[11:47:37] ItsEdBoi_: U also skipped officer discretion for the gun charge and then tried to make a deal on it as if he was actively possessing and stealing the gun, spirt of the law the gun charge was BS and just shouldnt have been on the table at all even though its by the book correct
[11:47:40] quaylewastaken: Didn't saying anything when y'all were talking about a 3 day drug trafficking charge
[11:47:40] brikbeans: stealing is when you dont take someones stuff based <3
[11:47:42] shamison1: @RomanNumera He is
[11:47:42] Grilbur: Yeah but he used a gun connected to so many crimes, its on him
[11:47:42] Toastbane: This is on state/DOJ not you guys, they don't want people robbing cops clearly with the hefty charges
[11:47:43] iwannanuhh: Cant he just make a new character for the three days. its not the end of the world
[11:47:44] KingOfTheAsylum: there needs to be big time for certain crimes to make the ambition to do crime die down
[11:47:45] PeculiarEboy: and then after he gets out cornwood is going to just get shot up all the time by any of the members
[11:47:46] PandaNomsBamboo: remember KIDD. stayed there for almost a week.
[11:47:46] JustJoshinYa2: Just get rid of NP at this point
[11:47:48] RexPappa: Compromise and make RP for him in jail, it was fucked but we can fix it later
[11:47:48] JakeStratic: Three days is too long but you're okay with Gregory Johnson taking a forever because he 'deserved it'. Mr. K deserves it on his crim activity @EsfandTV
[11:47:48] Marthentic: K's point in the Laws are unbalanced as hell in terms of length, and is right he was better off just killing and gotten lesser time. its dumb SAJ
[11:47:50] Desco_Sama: Desco_Sama subscribed with Prime. 
[11:47:50] RandomizeMike: @RomanNumera he always does
[11:47:52] cheesyskidle: cheesyskidle subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 33 months, currently on a 32 month streak! Is this where the Rank 1 Kayle streams are at?
[11:47:52] sircrumpler: WideHardo subs gang
[11:47:55] vultanize: at least it aint 21 days like the other guy
[11:47:57] soosmaz74: well it is over hopefully mr k understands it
[11:47:58] Mtayh: I think his punishment should be 6 hours, 75k fine, and just let him out of here
[11:47:58] EmDuBB13: @RedRobo true
[11:47:59] AnnoyedWithChat: Jail time shouldn't exist... It should ONLY be fines, increased revenue... More gameplay @EsfandTV
[11:47:59] Connorbrow: @justjoshinya2 it wasn't just for that, there were also 5 cases linked to the hot gun
[11:48:00] Capacchino: Couldn't he just RP on a different character for 3 days?
[11:48:00] Clear_96: and now all the hoppers are here
[11:48:00] qorzzz: Good intentions but bad comms. Also not smart to address how to charge people WHILE trying to charge someone lol.
[11:48:02] Brisk_Avocado: reverse deal KEKW
[11:48:02] ssurien: Get some SOP's written for processing crims step by step
[11:48:03] Ross_McD: You should draft up a procedure for pressing charges and submit it to a senior/slacks/beric @esfandtv
[11:48:05] Spired12: at least cornwood should get to use his gun more often now
[11:48:05] Shakeboxing: Can't do the time, don't do the crime we told our prisoners for 15 years. They still in Gitmo haha
[11:48:05] SumDee_LumDee: can‚Äôt wait for k to get out and just start targeting cops again and being fucking obnoxious as shit
[11:48:05] Desco_Sama: you die a hero or live long enough to become Ruth
[11:48:05] RicoLoco52: i don't think k would be as frustrated if prison rp was flushed out more.
[11:48:05] karaskyee: time to PULLITOVER
[11:48:06] hollowrust: tbh 3 days with bobby charles and carmine costello is worse than the 0s
[11:48:06] KGKN_007: @Alexpcorbin and somehow K has to pay for the PD's incompetence. Crazy.
[11:48:08] SaRAWRuby: damn ppl be spending big to say their opinion.
[11:48:08] x_juiceman: Mans bout to literally farm lock picks for 2800 minutes esfandPains
[11:48:08] jackkmanngo: Love u esfand
[11:48:09] hollowrust: 9s

[11:48:14] ZuldeadTV: i feel like the big crimes have too much time involved, and that's not good for a content server.
[11:48:14] BBCapitalist: @vultanize yeah how tf did justin get 21 days anyways? lol
[11:48:14] chewymorsel: the thirst for guilty please because getting the ducks in order first. is the achilles heel in this situation
[11:48:16] TheDarkNyet: slacks was trying to make deals way too soon
[11:48:16] 1manpizza: FeelsStrongMan Mr K made it almost 24 hours not being a felon again
[11:48:16] DaviMury: MAKE GOOD FUN RP = 3 days soft ban
[11:48:18] coldan01: why does bail not exist? he def can afford it
[11:48:19] Sairaph117: @Capacchino No. He'd have to login to the character and serve the sentence out.
[11:48:19] jdotno: you wanted to use that gun charge as leverage in the deal... like increasing the price of something so you can put it on sale.
[11:48:20] Raja_Banhammer: Wokege
[11:48:20] TheNachoManRandyCabbage: wtf
[11:48:20] soosmaz74: OMG
[11:48:20] EmDuBB13: shoulda jus had paused, gotten all charges in order, then sat him down
[11:48:21] JasonMunday: monkaW
[11:48:21] jessielight: holy crap
[11:48:22] ThronDon: end of the day everyone in the server knows dont have pd guns, to walk around with them its kinda deserved for stupidity at that point
[11:48:22] ZuldeadTV: holy shit
[11:48:22] marczm4n: k?
[11:48:22] ElDRojo: etf
[11:48:22] roeae: why does everyone want the best possible RP/scenario at every moment. this is the point of rping. ups and downs
[11:48:22] theshoover: monkaW
[11:48:22] khrow: this shit is wild LUL
[11:48:22] BigCumulonimbus: You‚Äôre dwelling on the past. You gotta move on
[11:48:23] kingkoolkattz: just saying can't we also agree K throwing the conversation made this even more of a pain in the ass to explain to him and other people
[11:48:23] Leafyerick: Wokege
[11:48:23] Mystikalrush: Thank you for the sub
[11:48:23] Apocco: At the end of the day he had a chance to cut the 3 days down significantly and chose not to
[11:48:23] existinne: D:

[11:48:31] walnutszs: on a public server where you get 100 new shitlords everyday sure use pd to soft ban them to keep your mods from having to follow everyone. But my lord banning mr k over a fun situation is so dumb
[11:48:32] millerlight44: hell week

[11:48:34] phaden_: WideHardu
[11:48:35] mattchutt: just needed to give your statement exactly what happened then have walked away.
[11:48:35] kylef_: Wokege CG ARRIVED
[11:48:35] EmDuBB13: hell week is here
[11:48:36] GlitchyGunZ: Moral of the story, listen to the cop with a bar license and this all would of been avoided @esfandtv
[11:48:36] Shmoopee: When did Cornwood get so sophisticated esfandWeird Why is he listening to jazz?
[11:48:39] Capacchino: @sairaph117 ohhhh, I didn't know that. Yeah 3 days is crazy then
[11:48:39] karaskyee: time to PULLITOVER
[11:48:42] JasonMunday: monkaW its happening
[11:48:44] brikbeans: When people steal from me i usually have it all still at the end of the stealing <3
[11:48:44] RexPappa: hoppers, I want to tell you that you all are cute
[11:48:44] CptTimberwolf: Wokege It's happening
[11:48:45] BigglesVII: Did a car blow up in the pool?
[11:48:47] DonnieRockettt: Purge War
[11:48:49] Phage_Cleaver: K works fast LUL
[11:48:49] TheLastRace: sounded like inside
[11:48:50] BigCumulonimbus: DON‚ÄôT FORGET TO LOCKER YOUR EQUIPMENT
[11:48:53] ABirky: @PandaNomsBamboo Kidd was in there for 21 days. Not almost a week. Almost a MONTH.
[11:48:54] MrActivated: Wokege AC-130
[11:48:56] HellaBitter: hell week part 2 starting :(
[11:48:56] Sairaph117: @Capacchino Yeah. Heh. It's real-time minutes.
[11:48:58] TheSlike123: biggest problem is pepole/chatters jumping to conclusions and boosting streamers feelings
[11:49:03] walnutszs: K is not mad about having shit on his record in a video game lol. hes mad cuz hes basically banned
[11:49:04] SaRAWRuby: @roeae its kinda annoying when dp hasnt been run right in YEARSSSSSSS
[11:49:07] walnutszs: its pretty simple
[11:49:09] Potato_Nation19: It was botched from start when they didnt listen to you @EsfandTV regarding presenting all the charges. Slack somehow meant you we PUSHING all those charges. Fucked it all up.
[11:49:09] Perne78: that's going real well.  lol
[11:49:10] RAMEEKILLEDSAMBAAS: How come Xavier lost his when he enter the pd academy?
[11:49:12] SaRAWRuby: pd
[11:49:12] aaronalford24: I don‚Äôt understand how you could have been allowed to be in there for the charges you were the victim should have been told to stay away
[11:49:18] scarydisk: @EsfandTV would of been better if you talk to Slack after K instead of trying to fix it in the middle
[11:49:21] maxmolly: @walnutszs thats literally what cornwood wanted to happen‚Ä¶. The only difference is he wanted to initialiy mention the possession charge so crims and cops in the future new that this was a clear case of possession + to show they‚Äôre giving a ton of slack to K.
[11:49:21] FaahQ2: you will be one of his top targets again
[11:49:22] s1cKNation: back to lawyer arc LUL
[11:49:22] walnutszs: No half his chat gets it cornwood
[11:49:24] WarrenPuffit: @walnutszs 100% CORRECT
[11:49:26] Dirtyjim: you were kidnapped, yea you would want to stack!
[11:49:27] Gusty331: You did make slacks go back
[11:49:27] jdotno: you did, so you could use them as leverage for making a deal
[11:49:28] The_TonyTortelini: im just saying we punished him for rp than we sent him to jail for 3 days where he cant rp so he has to just take 3 days off and there was no progressive rp the cops learned nothing and the crims are just gonna murder all the cops now
[11:49:29] Raja_Banhammer: those were all legit charges
[11:49:31] timedoggg: all this did was tell people not to try any rp with cops beyond cops just doing their job
[11:49:31] Sweet_BabyJeebus: only because you don't explain yourself sometimes
[11:49:32] thereal_lechuck: in reality LUL
[11:49:32] AlexSamaAU: tbf thats crimes spanning over weeks, so why is it too long if he was caught at the time itd just be same time spread out
[11:49:33] ElDRojo: essaying OVERLOAD
[11:49:34] zeldaspirit: He stacks the robberies to Sani, group 6 lol
[11:49:34] Westlove_: sucks kinda that the laws penalize rp
[11:49:34] Julian_______: @Potato_Nation19 this, miscommunication sucked ass
[11:49:34] ElDRojo: essaying OVERLOAD Û†ÄÄ
[11:49:35] tooper08: just sux he gets 2 days for a funny rp arc of tessa mad u brought a dolphin to the wedding party
[11:49:35] science_envisions: i feel like a fake interrogation with slacks might help
[11:49:36] ElDRojo: essaying OVERLOAD
[11:49:38] Toastbane: K should really make a cop character to understand both sides better in 4.0
[11:49:39] CookiesOP: The other officers didnt understand your point of purposing all the charges right vs actually pressing ALL OF EM
[11:49:40] Ciefon: it's crazy
[11:49:40] roshamb09: Maybe you should have just let it go once the mistake was made
[11:49:40] xCheekz: The only sad thing about all of this is the missed RP that would have been AMAZING if he kidnapped you successfully
[11:49:41] Vikairius: @rameekilledsambaas because of Murphy Braun things
[11:49:41] Capacchino: Right, but isn't that good cop RP?
[11:49:41] FaahQ2: go to the jail and talk with him
[11:49:42] brikbeans: is made out like cornwood said mr.k stole when he had all the property in his possession i have no clue wtf happened
[11:49:42] Dallabill28: cornwood kicked my dog!
[11:49:43] Bojabes: the optics are definately bad. But yeah, the charges shouldn't been presented initially
[11:49:44] jeremyks9: well from MR K perspective it looks like you screwed him
[11:49:45] 1vivy: did he get no time off?
[11:49:46] DrWetbone: 6 open cases a lawyer for the prosecution should handle this not cops
[11:49:46] Enzze: They don't want to understand sadly
[11:49:46] djhyzel78: I think u could help better being a judge or even a lawyer to make a change in my opinion
[11:49:47] 1manpizza: Need to start the interrogation with everything on the table and a clear goal, slacks rushed it
[11:49:47] soosmaz74: U WERE TRYING TO SERVE HIM THE FULL MENU AND THEN GET HIS STORY TO DRPO SOME CHARGES
[11:49:47] aoc_bae: that is how K sees it unfortunately. Might wanna email him ooc about the misunderstanding
[11:49:48] RerQ: Yeah I get it, Slacks did a bad job of explaining it though
[11:49:48] Wallsh_: Who cares about his chat
[11:49:50] marczm4n: there were better ways to do it is all
[11:49:51] manwod_77: tbf thats the way it looked when you brought it up to ruby and them in the cells also
[11:49:51] walnutszs: @maxmolly I know hes the only one who does and slacks kind of but he cant articulate or communicate so no one follows his lead
[11:49:53] Toastedgamer03: half of 24k is a lot of people not understanding NODDERS
[11:49:54] Th3Ch0: Love you corndog, thanks for trying your best always
[11:49:54] Bojabes: should have*
[11:49:55] sirsalem13: dammed if you do, damned if you don‚Äôt
[11:49:55] Sairaph117: OK some from a lawyer/PD perspective why would the victim be a charging officer?
[11:49:55] BigCumulonimbus: DON‚ÄôT FORGET TO LOCKER YOUR EQUIPMENT FOR EVIDENCE
[11:49:55] Potato_Nation19: @Julian_______ yea man totally agree.
[11:49:56] maestro__21: All it looks like was you tried to add a charge
[11:49:57] StreamElements: @esfandtv üí≤ inndur just donated $5.00: Well Esfand o 7. I know what you were going for but most people don't. Try to not let the haters get to you. Gonna be a blame game.
[11:49:57] Diamondman121314: You're right but unfortunately Mr K won't see it that way. It's just how things are because the charges were presented to K before they were ready
[11:49:58] chops_games: he shouldve been told that to begin with, the issue is he wasnt told of all the charges so it looks like yall added to remove some KEKW
[11:49:58] ABirky: @Westlove_ There has to be punishment to crime otherwise- why even have a PD?
[11:49:58] Bannanabread04: Is there going to be an OOC meeting about this? Maybe a new cell processing SOP & Training
[11:49:59] JakeStratic: Mr. K deserves 3 days more than Johnson deserves FOREVER... K intentionally did that criminal activity - Johnson made a mistake. RP is RP @EsfandTV
[11:49:59] PsychoJoker: I get annoyed with Mr K always getting away with shit or having him swapped with another to go free but damn LUL 3 days is rough.
[11:50:00] Zdubs37: Need a form and an SOP to follow for interrogation
[11:50:01] GlitchyGunZ: Indont see how you are blamed when you tried to tell slacks to approach this a certain way and he didn‚Äôt and it‚Äôs your fault? make it make sense @esfandtv
[11:50:01] justantoherwarlock1: 2800 months is crazy
[11:50:02] BigglesVII: It's just better transparency overall by the PD
[11:50:02] revanthebetrayer: Cornwood you in the right 100% but there's no way Mr K thought the jail time would be from kidnapping you over 2 attempted murders
[11:50:02] AndHaka54: well its too late now, things went south all you can do now is cover your bases. like documenting all the items with his dna if you haven't already
[11:50:02] MrActivated: common knowledge isn't so common
[11:50:03] condor2104: go patrol
[11:50:04] kylef_: lookUp essaying
[11:50:04] jeremyks9: slacks the one who screwed up
[11:50:04] walnutszs: its ooc for sure
[11:50:04] geo_logic_: puts you in a no win situation
[11:50:06] Zolothan: it was too late though man, you should have seen that right away, not 4 hours later
[11:50:06] RexPappa: Too many cocks in the kitchen tbf
[11:50:06] Waltz_Disney: it just sucks it took 3 hours
[11:50:06] Aphotice: half the people on either side will be upset no matter what
[11:50:07] RedRobo: K definitely knows the charges SHOULD stick. it's his role to fight it and weasel out of it. the problem is people seem to think PD shouldn't play their roles
[11:50:08] BBCapitalist: well part of it is a lot of us do understand, but was there really a need to do it like that?
[11:50:08] Phage_Cleaver: @EsfandTV Most of his chat overlaps with this chat. They get it
[11:50:08] Zelwaka: they get it its just your intent wasnt the outcome
[11:50:08] Joeblack_00: I mean you were hell bent on pushing the possession charge
[11:50:08] SantaJerrys: him and his chat is absolute cancer
[11:50:09] walnutszs: this ooc
[11:50:09] Alex_QT: abdulRP abdulRP abdulRP abdulRP abdulRP abdulRP abdulRP
[11:50:09] SMFTwistedSMF: People that regularly watch you get it. The people who dont. Will not. EVER. Its just what it is.
[11:50:09] The_TonyTortelini: im just saying we punished him for rp than we sent him to jail for 3 days where he cant rp so he has to just take 3 days off and there was no progressive rp the cops learned nothing and the crims are just gonna murder all the cops now
[11:50:10] ZuldeadTV: yo, to be fair Kebun COULD create a cop character meanwhile to get the point, 100% on him tho, would be awesome
[11:50:10] zeldaspirit: Yeah a prosecutor should handle this
[11:50:11] thevaultdweller55: the whole "just dont rob cops then" thing is complete bs. its a "grand theft auto" roleplay server where people are meant to do crime to open up rp
[11:50:11] Kowlineos: The only two wrong things that were done in my opinion were the fact that Cornwood said the judge name aloud. And that the charges were said aloud to Mr. K before they were fully ready and finished. Either way it was cool to see how all of this worked
[11:50:12] walnutszs: 100 percent
[11:50:13] kCblol: cool, the intentions were good. K stream cookied for 3 days
[11:50:14] happysquidy69: feels like no one won in this situation SAJ
[11:50:14] Julian_______: @Potato_Nation19 good learning moment tho
[11:50:14] kylef_: essaying holy
[11:50:14] soosmaz74: BASED
[11:50:16] mundfreudethenew: if anything slacks made the mistake by going in too early with wrong charges starting to make deals.
[11:50:17] Perne78: yeah that's the crappy part, the actual kidnapping arc would have been fire, but now its gonna turn into murder arc lol
[11:50:17] RicoLoco52: @xCheekz not like he couldn't attempt it again.
[11:50:17] Koolers_Mobile: No cornwood should not have been allowed to talk to K at all.
[11:50:17] EmDuBB13: like kit said, need to slow down, and get things in order
[11:50:18] WarrenPuffit: pd just banned a man for 3 days
[11:50:18] Wallsh_: HE DID THE CRIE
[11:50:18] Alexpcorbin: @kgkn_007 if K was presented with all the charges upfront, things might‚Äôve gone more smoothly and not a 3 hr process
[11:50:19] AFellowDegen: Thats totally fair
[11:50:19] 1manpizza: 4Shrug no one "won" this situation
[11:50:22] JasonMunday: HE CHOSE HIS FATE
[11:50:23] HellaBitter: Maybe anything over 24 hours has to be catch and release and sent to court?
[11:50:23] Alex_QT: abdulDrama abdulDrama abdulDrama abdulDrama abdulDrama abdulDrama abdulDrama
[11:50:24] Kolipto: @EsfandTV If there was more OOC conversations between the streamers I believe chat would be less hateful.
[11:50:24] coldan01: this can be fixed with bail. Mr k def can afford to pay it
[11:50:25] bigdanthegoodsir: he got company there now
[11:50:25] Sweet_BabyJeebus: i mean that's the punishment for the crime
[11:50:26] tootyscooty: but he did the crime and got caught???
[11:50:26] TheSlike123: @EsfandTV biggest problem is pepole/chatters jumping to conclusions and boosting streamers feelings
[11:50:26] soosmaz74: I feel bad for mr k now
[11:50:27] Pakkasparkers: its his own fault for being a dick
[11:50:27] 1vivy: YEP softban
[11:50:28] TheLastRace: @EsfandTV Well he got a Judge banned for planting a gun earlier
[11:50:29] RexPappa: Why not make RP for him, while hes in there. Maybe a mock jailbreak or something
[11:50:29] Marthentic: time imbalance is crazy
[11:50:29] djhyzel78: but you all wanted to push it tho
[11:50:29] PandaNomsBamboo: ok but what about the KIDD case
[11:50:30] Hardpu: 3 days of him not stealing turbos
[11:50:30] TwoHandedBells: !gamble 99%
[11:50:31] science_envisions: K also had this happen with ruth too right?
[11:50:31] Alex_QT: abdulDrama abdulDrama abdulDrama abdulDrama abdulDrama
[11:50:31] pennythug: like you said i think it was just too many cooks and it screwed everything up
[11:50:31] FaahQ2: a person with average 12-20k viewers
[11:50:32] Capacchino: Yeah 3 actual days is nutty
[11:50:32] AlexSamaAU: he has been doing crimes punishment free for weeks how isnt it fair
[11:50:33] manlydann: Didnt mean to do it but ended up doing it anyways.. unfortunate
[11:50:33] Sairaph117: Yea, this turned into you protecting Kevin, nor Cornwood and Mr. K RP.
[11:50:33] TheNachoManRandyCabbage: do the crime pay the time baby
[11:50:34] BrockLeeSwag: yeah just few bad apples going back and forth most love both streamers just minority
[11:50:35] manwod_77: COULD BE 21 DAYS @EsfandTV
[11:50:36] brikbeans: im super lost tho honestly how is stealing an act where you dont take the stuff even if it was 1 minutes thats derranged
[11:50:38] Potato_Nation19: @Julian_______ Hpefully *crosses fingers*
[11:50:38] Joongi_: At the end of the day, this is an MMO, and just like in everything PVP, people are gonna get mad when they "lose" 4Shrug
[11:50:38] Viske: He could have tried getting out of it but whatever man
[11:50:39] Wallsh_: 3 days is nothing
[11:50:40] tarzandaking: You can't start with a deal on charges bc then they want a deal on the deal you have to start with all then work down
[11:50:41] AFellowDegen: then he shouldn't do really bad crime
[11:50:45] TarvusPlz: that's not true at all lol. K's chat was being ruthless
[11:50:45] jacobtplatt: Crims are needed on the server and these laws are literally going to push them to quit entirely
[11:50:46] jeremyks9: i just don't see how this is good for RP on the server
[11:50:49] Viske: Don't be a bad crim EZ
[11:50:50] hooey91: why isnt there things to do in prison or a system for people with felonies?
[11:50:52] ncs_310: I just don‚Äôt understand the logic of half of crim chatters
[11:50:52] Miterex: u reading chat at these times is tough on the mental honestly. You're doing good by people
[11:50:53] CptTimberwolf: Can you do anything in prison yet?
[11:50:53] DrWetbone: you do tend to be nicer to your friend irl
[11:50:53] maestro__21: He just said hes not doing the podcast
[11:50:53] justantoherwarlock1: 1400 months for rping crims is just dumb
[11:50:53] crowgoes: Once you gave him the initial charges giving him more was always going to look bad
[11:50:53] ZuldeadTV: It's a lot
[11:50:54] timedoggg: good learning experience. learned not to try to rp with cops
[11:50:54] thevaultdweller55: the whole "just dont rob cops then" thing is complete bs. its a "grand theft auto" roleplay server where people are meant to do crime to open up rp
[11:50:54] FaahQ2: yeah, largest RP streamer on the server
[11:50:55] roshamb09: he's a good streamer he should be ok
[11:50:55] Hawaiianbreado: 3 days irl time?
[11:50:55] wavy__________________: Don't do Crime if you Can't Handle the Trime, or don't leave evidence
[11:50:55] The_TonyTortelini: im just saying we punished him for rp than we sent him to jail for 3 days where he cant rp so he has to just take 3 days off and there was no progressive rp the cops learned nothing and the crims are just gonna murder all the cops now.
[11:50:55] Deviii_: if you don't want the time don't do the crime? xdd
[11:50:55] JasonMunday: WHAT IS WRONG WITH PRISON RP??????
[11:50:56] RerQ: Then he shouldn't have done the crime!
[11:50:56] chops_games: he doesnt want to do the podcast though
[11:50:57] UA_Shark: 3 days is not a long time for the crazy amount of crime
[11:50:57] GanunaTwo: @esfandtv u guys have to stop changing charges after u read em out to the crim.... if u make mistakes u have to go with em... the situation just got out of fun cause you said 1400 first and then it went up
[11:50:57] Wallsh_: He can play another character
[11:50:57] LegitBanana_: play an alt
[11:50:58] aoc_bae: 3 days is lame just like den being out of pd for a month, also ye he doesnt wanna do it
[11:50:58] walnutszs: 3 hours bam hes done, give cops leeway to reduce shit and then hold it in there pocket for 30 days to be charged later if he keeps doing it
[11:50:58] Sairaph117: That was HIS choice. :P
[11:50:58] yeaimhere: 3 days kills a steam
[11:50:59] AFellowDegen: he can do more characters
[11:51:00] Sweet_BabyJeebus: side character?
[11:51:01] kylef_: It's basically a 3 day soft ban
[11:51:01] h0lk1: fuck around find out imo
[11:51:03] PennyForYourThotz: 3 days is a lot in RP
[11:51:03] Saucebauc3: "3 days is nothing" such a braindead take
[11:51:04] coldan01: what about increasing the fine and lowering the time
[11:51:04] draacx: now ask if he wants to come on the podcast lol
[11:51:04] Dirtyjim: he does so much crime! 12 hours a day robbing players and cops jumping off bridges.
[11:51:05] zzthejimzz: BabyRage
[11:51:06] fenr33r: its seriously not the cops fault, but... the laws are stupid, and with charges like this it should be a little more lenient towards the spirit of the law and not the letter in cases like this
[11:51:08] AFellowDegen: he knew what he was getting into
[11:51:09] condor2104: you can rp prison now
[11:51:09] RAMEEKILLEDSAMBAAS: 3 days is nothing - viewer who doesn't have to deal with it lol
[11:51:10] vazpia: You're allowed to play more than 1 character pentawICKED
[11:51:10] Bojabes: but wont the comeback stream and his rampage get viewers?
[11:51:10] pvtpoosky: people blaming you for unhinged chatters is crazy
[11:51:11] Hawaiianbreado: wait 3 days irl is sooo long
[11:51:11] nlwatcher: isnt prison stream fun now because of the warden?
[11:51:11] iwannanuhh: He has a massive community that watch for him, not his character. he will be fine
[11:51:12] JasonMunday: HE DOES FANTASTIC PRISON RP
[11:51:13] TheDarkNyet: if you don‚Äôt want the time don‚Äôt do the crime
[11:51:13] JakeStratic: IT IS FAIR - he did it @EsfandTV ... it sucks, but it is fair. Johnson banning from PD isn't fair.
[11:51:14] TheSlike123: @EsfandTV biggest problem is pepole/chatters jumping to conclusions and boosting streamers feelings, dont you agree?
[11:51:14] Mouso9: Look back at this in a few day I bet he will be fine
[11:51:15] RexPappa: Yeah you will lose viewers and money, Dean got a big bump just bcuz he was back on Den
[11:51:16] Yoshi_Squad: does he have to be online for all 3 days
[11:51:16] TwoHandedBells: meow
[11:51:17] ZuldeadTV: It's 10% of a month, if viewers are there only for Mr K, he loses those viewers for 10% of a month
[11:51:17] TKNL_: Kevin says nothing gone change because of Blau podcast
[11:51:17] Connorbrow: @jacobtplatt no it won't
[11:51:18] ZiroArchon: Is a crim in jail any different than a cop being suspended? Like, a parallel?
[11:51:18] MvKlutch: cant do the time, dont do the crime 4Shrug
[11:51:19] alaterra: you can‚Äôt rp in prison?
[11:51:19] staynsalty: then take a guilty plea
[11:51:20] UA_Shark: If there was no punishment then there‚Äôs no fun in the crime either
[11:51:20] warner05: He can play an Alt like Den and still get 15k views poor him
[11:51:20] brikbeans: The time doesnt matter at all its the fact you had the "stolen" items in your possession at all times like how is that stealing
[11:51:21] ncs_310: leaked Kebun podcast appearance LUL
[11:51:21] Phage_Cleaver: 3 Days is a long time for K's crew. That puts him behing the other gangs
[11:51:22] HellaBitter: Kebun is really good at making RP out of nothing though. He can be really creative at times
[11:51:23] brikbeans: im so lost
[11:51:24] Beef_Maestro: hai :3
[11:51:25] BBCapitalist: @nlwatcher fuck no theres nothing there lol
[11:51:26] Vaddix0056: not like he can't break out of jail anyways
[11:51:27] walnutszs: 3 days is nothing to people who are constantly getting banned sure but for a guy who makes his living off roleplay my god
[11:51:27] ben_v_art: yeah its a bit odd to want RP'ers then soft ban them for crim content LoL
[11:51:27] Joongi_: But I mean... He did what he did, am I missing something? LUL
[11:51:27] jeremyks9: 3 days is a long time for a game
[11:51:28] CSM_LIVE: there‚Äôs literally nothing functional in prison lol
[11:51:28] bigdanthegoodsir: do the crime do the time
[11:51:29] The_TonyTortelini: im just saying we punished him for rp than we sent him to jail for 3 days where he cant rp so he has to just take 3 days off and there was no progressive rp the cops learned nothing and the crims are just gonna murder all the cops now.
[11:51:30] chops_games: the part that sucks is there is nothing to do in prison like there was at the end of 3.0
[11:51:30] ItsEdBoi_: Guess I explained it bad, but the charge is correct however its game mechanic DNA, taking the gun wasnt really enough in my opinion to push the charge in good faith like the gun was a side piece to the whole charge situation. Does that make sense or am I cooked?
[11:51:31] hollowrust: that reddit rpgtaclips thread is crazyyyyyyy
[11:51:32] walnutszs: there is no prison roleplay.
[11:51:32] revanthebetrayer: I doubt Mr K knew the time before he did the crime lol
[11:51:33] Vallhan: Can mr k play another character?
[11:51:35] TheLastRace: @EsfandTV What about him planting the gun on Murphy Brawn and getting him banned as a judge for a while? same thing he is doing to other people
[11:51:35] KYslippy: time for crims to wise up.  cops are getting better
[11:51:35] Sahgos: Participants in the Sanguine war got 30 years (days irl) for treason lmao
[11:51:36] marczm4n: it wasn‚Äôt genuine dismissing his rp of washing the dna off the gun
[11:51:37] BigglesVII: Gets to RP with bobby and carmine, he's gonna torture them lol
[11:51:37] Daevise: i'm in both chats and have big respect for you both. the slacks deal was what he was mad about at the end not really anything with you
[11:51:38] RexPappa: Bobby not doing his job
[11:51:38] phoenixvakarian: esfandHearth
[11:51:39] PrettyKrazy: whats the point of prison though? people get out after 20 minutes usually. prison rp is just weak it needs work
[11:51:39] TwoHandedBells: any prison role players
[11:51:42] Deviii_: its not like its just one incident its alot
[11:51:42] chillaxinvibes: who we kidding?  K will have all kinds of fun with Bobby and Carmine in prison
[11:51:43] bluuhazard: https://clips.twitch.tv/CheerfulHedonisticSnakeKeepo-pTmNLC3fQ444us7G
[11:51:43] 1manpizza: He'll have content in prison, Bobby and Carmine xdd
[11:51:43] itzcookiebtw: @alaterra you can. but it‚Äôs gonna be boring asf and no one will want to be on and rp in there.
[11:51:44] TayG0: Do they have to be online for those minutes to count down?
[11:51:46] ZuldeadTV: @Vallhan yeah he can
[11:51:46] walnutszs: prison roleplay changes everything
[11:51:47] draacx: Yea, K will be fine Cornwood will die a few times after a couple days and then itll be over with
[11:51:47] FaahQ2: as entertaining goes, K is always a gas
[11:51:47] IncognitoOri: you got 7 days "prison" and still made content out of it
[11:51:47] jdotno: There was a lot of time and effort that they put in to kidnapping you which was going to turn on to some really great RP. Being that this is an rp server, there should be allowances made for these situations.
[11:51:47] Capacchino: @warner05 he has to play the character in jail to decrease the actual time...I thought the same thing initially
[11:51:48] JuggernuttzICBM: Cops and criminals should come together and write the laws instead of having crane put all the laws in pds favor
[11:51:48] OP_Cam: doesnt matter you have to roll with rp. thats what the charges are and youre convicted why should he not have to go along with the RP
[11:51:49] Sairaph117: Remember when Max asked if you had a Jesus complex? You don't need to save everyone from themselves, and that includes Kevin's career.
[11:51:51] Wallsh_: Just making excuses for crims being lazy.  Why carry a hot gun on a kidnapping
[11:51:51] RerQ: Crims always do this, they think they can get away with everything then cry when they get caught
[11:51:52] slomojosh: it‚Äôs just stupid how this all could‚Äôve been avoided if they were up front from the beginning and worked down
[11:51:52] Potato_Nation19: Chat, Mr. K coulda have given even SOME info. He chose this course, on him.
[11:51:52] Downthrower: bobby charles will have the keys tomorrow so atleast theres that
[11:51:57] SumDee_LumDee: fuck it lets patrol
[11:51:58] JasonMunday: essaying essaying essaying essaying
[11:51:58] GD_Rep: Kebun just said in stream he isn't going to be on the podcast @EsfandTV
[11:51:59] condor2104: you have Bobby and gang there now,  must be some rp
[11:51:59] Blizzard5050: basically, if he got caught 5 times and broke up the charges, it wouldn‚Äôt be so bad. but if he keeps escaping, he can‚Äôt claim ignorance of getting full punishment
[11:52:00] SumDee_LumDee: fuck this shit
[11:52:00] existinne: Need to go visit him here and there
[11:52:01] itzcookiebtw: @tayg0 no they can be offline
[11:52:02] AztecKniight: If a non-streamer went through this, would you change your thought process?
[11:52:02] madhatterui: @EsfandTV i still think u should've shot him in the car Kappa
[11:52:04] BBCapitalist: @chillaxinvibes nothing is set up yet there's nothing there lol
[11:52:04] GlitchyGunZ: I‚Äôm more frustrated for you because this shitshow is what you didn‚Äôt want to happen. @esfandtv
[11:52:04] KGKN_007: @Alexpcorbin i agree but PD wants to create a shit show, keep him there for 3 hours just to double the charges. Ofcourse it's gonna piss anyone off.
[11:52:04] Alexpcorbin: K gonna go on a cop killing spree after this lol
[11:52:06] SumDee_LumDee: time to stop crime
[11:52:07] coldan01: @esfandtv do a podcast with kebun about this situation LULE
[11:52:09] walnutszs: you should have to go to prison for essential things on the crafting bench and all of that... lockpicks are not enough
[11:52:10] frostflakeheron: RIPBOZO
[11:52:11] Clear_96: @EsfandTV isnt it kinda a double edged sword for him? Picking content with a consequence of a 3d jail for content?
[11:52:13] jacobtplatt: @Connorbrow If you got soft banned for legit 28 hours. Im sure that would leave a bad taste in your mouth lmao
[11:52:13] Ferfind69: the Yes guy was in prison for like 20 days if i remember
[11:52:14] Snicklefritz95: Nobody kidnaps Big C. Huge dub SeemsGood
[11:52:16] Scrando: at least you know he won‚Äôt be busy with rp so he might be able to do the podcast kekw
[11:52:17] TwoHandedBells: shoulda gave em the sam bass salute\
[11:52:18] Sairaph117: Kevin is an adult. Treat him like one.
[11:52:18] Apocco: doubt it could've been avoided tbh
[11:52:18] ElDRojo: essaying with low emote count
[11:52:20] JasonMunday: GETALIFE GO KILL SOME LOCALS
[11:52:20] jnzl: Starts talking about caring about the streamer, mans feeling guilty :(
[11:52:22] Vallhan: He can just make sbs character while hes in prison
[11:52:22] Zdubs37: Maybe he just wanted to play FF7 for a few days
[11:52:22] TraviTV: If prison wasn't such a content deathtrap going for 3 days wouldn't be so bad
[11:52:22] EmDuBB13: it was way more then 7 days and you still made good content
[11:52:24] Ciefon: @Alexpcorbin let's hope he doesn't get caught then
[11:52:25] RerQ: @Clear_96 yes exactly
[11:52:27] shizbang_: Ya'll dont even know Kebun was trying to RP a mission given to him by an ADMIN of np
[11:52:27] zeldaspirit: If he stacks his crimes obviously is going to have many charges. It sucks but that's how it is. And you guys tried to help, he didn't offer anything and he didn't get it
[11:52:27] Leafyerick: @Alexpcorbin Cause he hasn't already done that LMAO
[11:52:28] soosmaz74: i mean this is part of his story now so he has to use it to develop his character. exactly like when u got suspended for a week and u had to do other things to build up cornwood's character
[11:52:29] RAMEEKILLEDSAMBAAS: Maybe talk to him in game to clear things up?
[11:52:29] theshmuel: @Alexpcorbin you mean what hes already been doing for over two weeks
[11:52:29] 1vivy: you can still rejail for less?
[11:52:32] RaunchyOLDwoman: Its just a to many cooks thing, everyone is trying to do what they think is right, but others dont see it the same way, things get all blended up and messy.
[11:52:33] brikbeans: @EsfandTV claiming asking you to move your stuff so its not available to you isnt stealing or am i dengte
[11:52:33] TheSlike123: @bluuhazard so wholesome
[11:52:36] GLSMarbles: HUH
[11:52:36] JasonMunday: NUGGIES PogU
[11:52:36] Sweet_BabyJeebus: would Cornwood give them all the charges? I feel like Esfand is bleeding in a bit much here
[11:52:37] antreids: But because it was not worked out in the beginning, what you tried to avoid became inevitable after Slacks finally got it
[11:52:38] Wallsh_: Letting this OOC get to you I think
[11:52:39] TrippMinds: No one forced K to robbed Cornwood, he chose a high steak chance of getting caught so now he reap what he sow
[11:52:39] droksid00: nuggies guys
[11:52:39] RerQ: @shizbang_ and he failed it
[11:52:39] Kolipto: We get you! Don't worry. The group OOC call you hosted was big. Hopefully more soon.
[11:52:40] The_TonyTortelini: im just saying we punished him for rp than we sent him to jail for 3 days where he cant rp so he has to just take 3 days off and there was no progressive rp the cops learned nothing and the crims are just gonna murder all the cops now.
[11:52:41] RicoLoco52: kevin seems to think that everyone is kinda stuck in their way of thinking as far as crim/cop relations go
[11:52:41] alaterra: what is OOC?
[11:52:42] walnutszs: if they jail had value from crime life alot of the crims wouldnt be so mad
[11:52:45] dapyman: One thing I think we all learned tonight, Slacks should never be a lawyer
[11:52:45] Scrando: chickie nuggies PogU
[11:52:46] TheSoldier1851: Crispy Chicken Nuggies pogg
[11:52:48] walnutszs: out of city
[11:52:51] timedoggg: Soft ban for trying to kidnap cornwood for something. message sent. don't rp with cops
[11:52:53] SMFTwistedSMF: They were doing alot of RP in prison at the end of 3.0. They outta work that back in. Like now, Gives K something to do.
[11:52:55] jeremyks9: if you could somehow escape prison maybe be good RP
[11:52:55] Capacchino: @alaterra out of character
[11:52:55] Wallsh_: BIG TIME
[11:52:56] PeculiarEboy: @alaterra Out Of Character
[11:52:57] 1vivy: OOC is out of character
[11:52:57] marczm4n: it‚Äôs worth examining bc his reaction to the possession would have been the same at the outset. the charge was ridiculous however it was presented
[11:52:57] JasonMunday: everyone screwed up
[11:52:59] khrow: now hes soft banned instead LULW
[11:52:59] Mouso9: If anyone can make prison RP it's K.  Look at the the last month. And this time it'll be legal hahaha
[11:53:00] ElDRojo: @alaterra out of content FeelsOkayMan
[11:53:00] NVisionZ: don‚Äôt you think the sani and group 6 workers think having literally everything stolen from them isn‚Äôt fun either? I mean there has to be consequences. even though the charges weren‚Äôt your intention
[11:53:01] JakeStratic: You're losing the plot... he did the crime and he does the time @EsfandTV
[11:53:03] rocco244: You didn't do anything wrong
[11:53:05] 1manpizza: the worst possible time LULE
[11:53:05] fredhw: Justin, Bobby and Timo had it worst, they made it out with more viewers. He is fine and deserved it IC anyway.
[11:53:09] BigCumulonimbus: DON‚ÄôT FORGET TO PUT YOUR EQUIPMENT IN EVIDENCE
[11:53:10] droksid00: he was getting caught regardless of scuff
[11:53:11] Phage_Cleaver: None of that is Cornwoods fault. K picked the wrong time and place
[11:53:11] Alexpcorbin: @kgkn_007 They def took too long
[11:53:11] Rapikapi: @EsfandTV i think cornwood should hold a class about how to press charges
[11:53:12] walnutszs: @timedoggg exaclty instead just say fuck you and shoot them is what he heard
[11:53:13] condor2104: he knew what he was doing not your fault
[11:53:15] Bigeyez: After the situation was fucked you guys shouldn't have brought up the gun charge. Yes he deserved it but slacks fucked it and came in with less charges
[11:53:15] EmDuBB13: ya thats completely stupid
[11:53:15] hawkeye69r: Slacks made a mistake. K got mad. You got mad at slacks' mistake. But imo it could have been saved if you shouted K down and demand he let you explain
[11:53:16] RexPappa: Slacks and Cornwood dont work well together when it comes to due process. I Cwood shoud start realizing that
[11:53:17] The_TonyTortelini: im just saying we punished him for rp than we sent him to jail for 3 days where he cant rp so he has to just take 3 days off and there was no progressive rp the cops learned nothing and the crims are just gonna murder all the cops now.
[11:53:21] zzthejimzz: people are wild in here
[11:53:23] shizbang_: He carried the gun in order to kidnap you...
[11:53:23] zeldaspirit: @nvisionz exactly!
[11:53:28] Sweet_BabyJeebus: in-character Mr K is a criminal
[11:53:30] Kiyoni: He should've just took off when EMS rolled up anyway instead of doubling down with the kidnapping
[11:53:32] alaterra: thanks. so when streamers talk to each other out of game?
[11:53:33] Perne78: the gun wasn't even a problem lol....  that gun would have been like a 20k fine and 50 hours
[11:53:37] ZuldeadTV: Nekoda frenn
[11:53:37] 1manpizza: xdd odd
[11:53:38] TheSlike123: @EsfandTV you should check the clip of saab that got sent in chat
[11:53:39] revanthebetrayer: The hot gun is only like 30% of the total time is it not?
[11:53:40] Chaoszero_goc: I think he beats that possession charge in court
[11:53:40] ItsEdBoi_: The hot gun didnt matter its the robbery and pd gun charges that are cooked
[11:53:42] brikbeans: SHITSHOW
[11:53:43] kylef_: SHITSHOW
[11:53:44] jdotno: He always refused to drop that molten hot gun because for RP he wants to have it when he gets caught
[11:53:44] PrettyKrazy: FeelsDankerMan rough
[11:53:44] soosmaz74: missunderstanding
[11:53:45] s1cKNation: its time for a rebirth Kappa
[11:53:46] bb_woo: Was a impulsive crime he had no plans üëçüòé
[11:53:48] Perne78: all the time was due to the robbery and possession charge
[11:53:49] RerQ: @shizbang_ could have used a different gun
[11:53:52] mattchutt: slacks
[11:53:53] Capacchino: A daggum shitshow
[11:53:54] CptTimberwolf: YEP Slacks
[11:53:54] 1manpizza: Slacks
[11:53:54] PrettyKrazy: mfw
[11:53:55] AFellowDegen: slacks is retarded
[11:53:56] kylef_: Slacks YEP
[11:53:57] tootyscooty: slacks
[11:53:57] draacx: If you are ooc generally feeling bad maybe reach out to K offline tomorrow or the next day after things settle Kevin is pretty good at keeping things in the city and not take it personally
[11:53:57] MrActivated: xdd
[11:53:58] Marthentic: the machinic of what he wanted to accomplish don't really exist yet... and even Hardwood cause Cornwood is never off duty
[11:53:58] Sairaph117: People trying to protect KEVIN THE STREAMER.
[11:54:00] SavageTarzan: IFISPEAK
[11:54:01] s1cKNation: a mayor shitshow
[11:54:01] PWRslide2: in the cover up
[11:54:03] Brakon: people not listening to cornwood and assuming what he means.
[11:54:03] h0lk1: SLACKS
[11:54:05] Sweet_BabyJeebus: just say Slacks
[11:54:05] tootyscooty: SLACKS???
[11:54:06] walnutszs: say this in roleplay you know the answer cornwood
[11:54:07] maestro__21: Slacks didnt want to push it
[11:54:07] kylef_: And people thinking you were trying to actually "push" the charge
[11:54:07] Shmoopee: pepeLaugh
[11:54:08] The_TonyTortelini: im just saying we punished him for rp than we sent him to jail for 3 days where he cant rp so he has to just take 3 days off and there was no progressive rp the cops learned nothing and the crims are just gonna murder all the cops now.
[11:54:13] P0TES: slacks just wanted to hear the story for rp
[11:54:14] GlitchyGunZ: Slacks jumped the gun so fast. @esfandtv also the kidnapping got scuffed fast. that‚Äôs all gotta be frustrating for all parties involved it‚Äôs a lot to take in
[11:54:15] TarvusPlz: Be nice to Slacks, chat ReallyMad he'll be a good officer some day
[11:54:16] Mic_Stargazer: I think that 3 days is excessive but consider how much time he "stole" from sani workers and G6 workers he farmed for easy loot with a gun for weeks straight. How many days d o you think that adds up to?
[11:54:18] Kaisenjin: You know PepeLaugh
[11:54:18] rameyplays: The hot gun literally was not even a tenth of the time. The fine for robbing an officer and having the gun is insane.
[11:54:23] 1manpizza: peepoRun
[11:54:23] Wynter282: he was talked to way too soon slacks didnt even know about the dna or anything when he went in there idk what the rush to get in there was
[11:54:23] bamboniiii: there was tooo many got damn cooks in the damn kitchen @EsfandTV
[11:54:24] Cloaked_in_Fiction: Slacks was trying to cut a plea deal before presenting the charges
[11:54:24] brikbeans: @EsfandTV asking you to move your stuff so you cant use it isnt the same as stealing thats the confusion
[11:54:24] Stagnation: Mr. K screwed up. he got pardoned, then carried an illegal gun, was doing petty crimes right out of the gate, and got caught. 4Shrug
[11:54:26] CptTimberwolf: He's covering for him FeelsStrongMan
[11:54:27] FaahQ2: evidence and cop discretion both matter.....right Floppy dong
[11:54:28] loiares: If hes trying to help, then help by telling Nikoda it was slacks fault?????
[11:54:31] SumDee_LumDee: YIKES close one
[11:54:33] BigCumulonimbus: DON‚ÄôT FORGET TO PUT YOUR EQUIPMENT IN EVIDENCE LOCKER
[11:54:36] SageAMDP: esfandTonys
[11:54:43] KevinnTCG: jesus some people here need to calm down
[11:54:47] The_TonyTortelini: im just saying we punished him for rp than we sent him to jail for 3 days where he cant rp so he has to just take 3 days off and there was no progressive rp the cops learned nothing and the crims are just gonna murder all the cops now.
[11:54:47] CptTimberwolf: Cornwood my tank FeelsStrongMan
[11:54:53] Stagnation: @The_TonyTortelini saying he can't RP isn't even right, carmine and bobby run the prison now. and they're talking about hiring the dans. shit's gonna be silly in prison.
[11:54:54] ens0mniac: stop speaking in generalizations pleaaaaase lol @esfandtv
[11:54:55] Sweet_BabyJeebus: @EsfandTV you are beating around the bush right now, just blame how Slacks handled it
[11:54:56] RAMEEKILLEDSAMBAAS: Charges less isn't as bad as charging more for the benefit of rp
[11:55:02] BigglesVII: It was a negotiation on charges before everyone knew everything.
[11:55:07] Radiencetv: i never seek K not pissed in the police station.. its role play
[11:55:07] ExpedientMiner: L POWERGAMING META CHAT HOPPING W CHASING COPSTACKING CHARGE STACKING NO FREE SLUSHIES RIPBOZO jk please dont ban me
[11:55:09] marczm4n: that‚Äôs not what happened
[11:55:10] walnutszs: exactly
[11:55:15] DingusDK: DingusDK subscribed with Prime. 
[11:55:16] soosmaz74: @loiares its not slacks fault this was one entire shitshow full of miscommunication
[11:55:19] emery_steele: leaves less room for bargaining
[11:55:20] Mic_Stargazer: @The_TonyTortelini It's not "punished for RP" it's punishment for crimes committed which is the risk of a crim, the punishment th ough I agree is just excessive.
[11:55:20] Joongi_: @the_tonytortelini What's your solution?
[11:55:22] boombakllava: jumped on charges
[11:55:24] The_TonyTortelini: im just saying we punished him for rp than we sent him to jail for 3 days where he cant rp so he has to just take 3 days off and there was no progressive rp the cops learned nothing and the crims are just gonna murder all the cops now.
[11:55:25] CowWizardMoneyGang: he doesnt want more fuckin conflict why would he blame slacks?? use your head
[11:55:26] bb_woo: Of course they are it's content creators vs content creators we would get a ban lolüòé
[11:55:27] shamison1: But if slacks is the captain, why does he do what cornwood says as a PPO?
[11:55:27] KoyoteO: Slack negotiated with himself based on what he thought would stick, prematurely
[11:55:27] KYslippy: y'all need a checklist/flowchart
[11:55:28] PWRslide2: do your job or do RP, that is the question
[11:55:30] kylef_: exactly, they jumped to the chase too quick
[11:55:33] Raja_Banhammer: nekoda gets it
[11:55:33] MrActivated: YEP
[11:55:34] CptTimberwolf: YEP
[11:55:36] jeremyks9: cops charge what they can. Take away the charges they want and thats how you make deals
[11:55:40] Joongi_: @mic_stargazer Exactly
[11:55:41] Kiyoni: Nekoda Pog
[11:55:42] SavageTarzan: EZ
[11:55:48] Sweet_BabyJeebus: "they"
[11:55:51] yaboygrumbles: I think Nekoda gets who caused the shitshow lol
[11:55:55] The_TonyTortelini: im just saying we punished him for rp than we sent him to jail for 3 days where he cant rp so he has to just take 3 days off and there was no progressive rp the cops learned nothing and the crims are just gonna murder all the cops now.
[11:55:55] Shmoopee: Nekoda actually gets it! esfandW
[11:55:56] Stagnation: @The_TonyTortelini oh you're just spamming the same stuff over and over YEP my bad.
[11:55:57] Capacchino: It's crazy how easy it is to understand when both parties are on the same page
[11:55:58] TimmayHS: everyone was literally in agreement except slacks @EsfandTV
[11:56:00] TheSlike123: @EsfandTV i think rp`ers have ``ptsd`` from cpt. Ruth and thats why Mr. K just gave up
[11:56:01] soosmaz74: exactly
[11:56:03] zeldaspirit: EXACTLY
[11:56:05] science_envisions: nakoda gets it
[11:56:08] marczm4n: so just abuse the game mechanics?
[11:56:10] Doqx42: So glad Nekoda called to checkup
[11:56:13] soosmaz74: 3
[11:56:14] silver_ash: that's normal procedure but Slacks didn't make it properly clear to the other cops that he wasn't confident in the PD weapon charge and left it off on his own volition.
[11:56:17] revanthebetrayer: Mr K thinks the police is incompetent because every time he deals with them they do something to make him think that. Cornwood is trying to fix that.
[11:56:19] CptTimberwolf: Equal treatment under the law CORNMAN
[11:56:19] CowWizardMoneyGang: @marczm4n what was abused??\
[11:56:21] driver1036: Have fun at your first press conference
[11:56:26] Mic_Stargazer: The time is excessive but what's the alternative? The guy farms sani worker civs. Think about how much time theylost that he "stole"
[11:56:27] ben_v_art: lol
[11:56:27] Shmoopee: 2 ant. a half
[11:56:27] sKingNA: kekw
[11:56:29] walnutszs: saab is not a good communicator he drives me nuts. He means well but he also has an ego. The arresting officers regardless of rank should be the one in charge of these things. In this case cornwood was the one directly involved, he should have been in the room alone negotiationg the deal. That goes across the board
[11:56:29] Yoshi_Squad: WutFace
[11:56:31] Joongi_: Nekoda Ratge but Nekoda 5Head
[11:56:32] Kaisenjin: @marczm4n WhatChamp ?
[11:56:35] Pee_aRe: these people coming in here like of now he going kill all the cops like he hasn't been doing that already. He fucked up his Mission take the L go next
[11:56:36] RAMEEKILLEDSAMBAAS: K was bleeding  out of his ear lol
[11:56:36] kennypowersyall: Sludge
[11:56:37] s0ggybreads: preach nekoda my brain is sludge after 3 hr
[11:56:37] marczm4n: @cowwizardmoneygang the game mechanics. slacks understood the rp
[11:56:39] The_TonyTortelini: im just saying we punished him for rp than we sent him to jail for 3 days where he cant rp so he has to just take 3 days off and there was no progressive rp the cops learned nothing and the crims are just gonna murder all the cops now.
[11:56:46] marczm4n: @cowwizardmoneygang cornwood don‚Äôt
[11:56:46] CowWizardMoneyGang: @marczm4n oh so you arent serious ok
[11:56:47] TimmayHS: if you handled it all by yourself you could have had it done 2 hours ago
[11:56:48] brikbeans: this is horrendous and now i understand why people say cop rp is cooked.
[11:56:49] RerQ: @Mic_Stargazer 100%, he ruins their gameplay for his gain
[11:56:53] RexPappa: hellweek BatChest
[11:56:56] yaboygrumbles: Slacks came in trying to speed run to a plea deal essentially
[11:56:58] InsecureForSure: hell yeah flute time peepoFlute
[11:57:00] marczm4n: @cowwizardmoneygang you didn‚Äôt watch?
[11:57:00] Joongi_: modCheck
[11:57:00] desol8r: Let him cry in jail
[11:57:00] Toastedgamer03: @walnutszs cornwood was the victim so technically he shouldn't have been in that process at all except for putting a statement in
[11:57:05] Mic_Stargazer: @RerQ That's why I'm so on the fence. I think 3 days is insanely excessive but look at what he does to people all day long
[11:57:06] Kaisenjin: @Mic_Stargazer The time will be dropped, but first you need to show all the charges to the crimes/lawyers
[11:57:06] Perne78: savior complex.. you didn't need to be there at all and probably shouldn't have been other than given a statement
[11:57:09] RedRobo: i mean technically if we're RPing an investigation the victim should've been nowhere near the interrogation room 4Shrug
[11:57:09] zeldaspirit: Slacks is not good communicator. He's good for other things but he isn't good at communicating
[11:57:10] RerQ: @desol8r 100%
[11:57:10] PowerTurbo: cornwood law school
[11:57:11] walnutszs: if your captains handle everything then no one can develop and the relationship with crims and leadership of pd is always sour. Keep them out of interviews, the cells etc. Let them work on the higher level
[11:57:13] brikbeans: This is the epitome of that
[11:57:14] MahanGM: Nekoda Ratge
[11:57:14] BiZARGoN: its incosistant
[11:57:16] Alexpcorbin: Not being understood hurts the most imo‚Ä¶
[11:57:16] Kiyoni: walnutszs Cornwood was the VICTIM, he wasnt the arresting officer - that being said, slacks did handle it completely wrong
[11:57:17] Sweet_BabyJeebus: Softwood

[11:57:22] The_TonyTortelini: im just saying we punished him for rp than we sent him to jail for 3 days where he cant rp so he has to just take 3 days off and there was no progressive rp the cops learned nothing and the crims are just gonna murder all the cops now.
[11:57:27] codyjohnson766: the point is the laws shouldn‚Äôt be set up to punish a streamer for three days. at the end of the day it‚Äôs a game that revolves around crims.
[11:57:28] jeremyks9: Not considering RP is horrible too

[11:57:39] Vikairius: Slacks was more concerned about the hot gun and made mistakes because of it.
[11:57:40] TheSlike123: @Pee_aRe difference is that he was now saying he was gonna target one person not the whole pd

[11:57:42] gatsymphony00: @The_TonyTortelini  ok if we are going ooc why are these charges so sever because cg wanted to lootbox cops to get every w against civs pay the price in the long term then
[11:57:46] BigglesVII: When evidence result in multiple cases coming back they should all take 15mins to read it and discuss before any interrogation

So the arresting officer should run the room, present charges and then let cornwood have the final word on the total time and fine

[12:02:48] dapyman: Fantastic that this discussion is with Nekoda
[12:02:49] walnutszs: The way we do it is we fully charge people, send them to jail for 20% of their time and they have to post 20% of their fine for bail, we then send the charges to a DA, they decide weather to purse a court case. Our time and fines are high but because people typically only serve 20 percent its actually less. The only time DAs press charges after the fact is if the cops on scene and arresting officer suggest it to moderate people going a little to far and not really roleplaying but just being ass

[12:04:34] Mic_Stargazer: @walnutszs I think the reason they don't is because they've had lots of issues with a DA in past server editions, but if it's got a lot of OOC rules or just basically an admin slot it might work

[12:07:46] thevaultdweller55: the whole "just dont rob cops then" thing is kinda wack. its a roleplay server where people are meant to do crime to open up rp
[12:07:47] walnutszs: most cops want a w especially when they arnt involved in the scene. All they have is the evidence to look at, if you aint part of the original scene you get no say

[12:08:05] sevenonesmith: but he could still do things around the city k is stuck in a cage kinda different but same principle

[12:08:17] bb_woo: Yea a hour is ruff days is just crazy might as well be a 3 banüòé
[12:08:19] EmDuBB13: he got fucked for a month and did less crying
[12:08:20] ben_v_art: yeah there's like a disconnect on RP streamers and IRL results.
[12:08:23] bluey_28: @Felaryn yep. people need to go outside from time to time lol
[12:08:23] AnnoyedWithChat: The PD is hurting for money... replace jailtime with larger fines, Crims got bank @EsfandTV
[12:08:25] StreamElements: Printed Cases, Platelights, and Platelight panels have landed! üå†starforgepc.com/Esfand
[12:08:29] oofinside: Stare Taycum
[12:08:29] deja_entendeuce: imagine setting precedent for charges in a scuff induced arrest instead of giving him 400 months and getting a great story and rp from it
[12:08:30] Doqx42: Who sets the time for the charges? Is it DOJ (i.e. Crane) or "State"?
[12:08:30] Mic_Stargazer: @thevaultdweller55 CG ramped WAY too hard, you don' thave to rob a cop every other day to RP lol
[12:08:33] CptTimberwolf: Sadge
[12:08:34] Undead_Frankie: Sadge
[12:08:36] skeletor2800: slacks hecked it up not you
[12:08:37] JasonMunday: GETALIFE STOP IT
[12:08:37] xblasphemye: this is amazing RP i just feel bad that it went down like this for everyone involved
[12:08:38] TwoHandedBells: frig it time for ff7
[12:08:38] ZuldeadTV: Sadge
[12:08:39] The_Strix01: Nekota missed the mark, it wasnt confidence.
[12:08:40] afghanpsycho: This is what happens when you are nice to people who dont deserve it, they walk all over you.
[12:08:40] 1vivy: sadge
[12:08:41] Leafyerick: @thevaultdweller55 sure but it was becoming an issue where cops were getting treated as NPC loot boxes and the charges got increased because it was happening too much
[12:08:42] KevinnTCG: It is right according to the law/rules in the game.
[12:08:44] Wallsh_: You are letting get to you ooc way too much
[12:08:45] Vasaria: 3200 hours is way too much honestly, K isn't wrong he should just shoot first and risk smaller charges
[12:08:45] jdotno: rp denied
[12:08:46] walnutszs: i dont think yall should be talking to judges though before you press charges
[12:08:50] Cecedg125: esfandL esfandL
[12:08:53] TheDarkNyet: you were doing the right thing though
[12:08:53] sKingNA: Its harder to do the right thing most times, and it usually feels worse too
[12:08:53] ZiroArchon: RP stockholm syndrom?
[12:08:53] Bojabes: You're correct, but it was all a shitshow with communication at the beginning and it spiraled waaay out
[12:08:55] uniquewolfine: 2 days don't seem bad after seeing that guy for 21 days in jail
[12:08:55] Kolipto: The end result was not what your intent was. That's for sure.
[12:08:57] skeletor2800: muddying the waters by doing the right thing doesnt make it your fault
[12:08:57] CuIdra: Is it PD policy to present the entire menu then take off charges?
[12:08:59] holymoly_02: its rp so chill
[12:09:01] shamison1: NGL You did the right thing, i think the chargers were not explained WHY he was being charged in that way, and i think k may have also been slightly salty ooc that he was caught but i could be wrong.
[12:09:02] RietArtwork: I feel you esfandL
[12:09:05] PaullyBryant: I feel like we need a Men in Black moment and wipe the past 3 hours. doesn‚Äôt feel right now
[12:09:05] the_bucket_plays: dont worry to much when Lasso comes u can make a different set of SOP's and Penalties
[12:09:05] jinnytolls: @Mic_Stargazer 100% agree. Guns are too powerful and they just hold onto the guns instead of tossing them after X amount of crimes. Dumb on their part
[12:09:07] Sweet_BabyJeebus: If anything you're being too soft
[12:09:08] mattchutt: u just needed to give statement and let them handle. shit happens tho slacks rushed everything without having correct charges in place
[12:09:09] crescenterra: lmfao why not
[12:09:11] droksid00: that happens in REAL LIFE
[12:09:11] JO3Y_C: K was ready to tell his story then stuff got scuffed
[12:09:11] Lumberjack_: he was doing it for tessa it he wasnt just blindly kidnapping a cop
[12:09:11] neighborhoodcapricorn: Your actions only had impact because of his attitude though. It would have made no difference with a normal crim
[12:09:12] stoohs: i LOVE jail rp WOOOOOO
[12:09:13] SavageTarzan: mhm well if you didn't have an ass the shit would just pile up
[12:09:14] PeculiarEboy: And you weren't allowed to be the one to talk, too many cooks in the kitchen
[12:09:14] BlackSai1s: esfandCOPS esfandCOPS esfandCOPS
[12:09:15] droksid00: talking to judges
[12:09:15] slomojosh: it shouldn‚Äôt have been done in front  K to begin with
[12:09:15] EmDuBB13: how would that NOT be ok? thats so stupid
[12:09:15] BBCapitalist: @xblasphemye yeah definitely. cornwood is right to feel the way he did but was a bit too heavy handed
[12:09:16] TimmayHS: you should NOT feel bad at all, Slacks fucked it up - the only thing you did wrong was talk about the judge in the room. Everything else everyone agreed with you on, just not Slacks @EsfandTV
[12:09:16] xblasphemye: @Vasaria but that wasnt the RP he was trying to do. they wanted cornwood for something, not to just shoot him
[12:09:16] Rivath: @CuIdra They were the actual charges Slacks just messed up
[12:09:17] CptTimberwolf: Clarification is good, it prevents wasting time
[12:09:18] fourmaticTV: bad timing on trying to fix procedure imo
[12:09:18] 1vivy: it's not your fault but it helps to not step in in these cases
[12:09:19] walnutszs: with the DA not with the arresting officers
[12:09:19] Perne78: as a victim, you probably shouldn't have been involved at all though other than a witness statement
[12:09:21] crescenterra: literally
[12:09:21] BrockLeeSwag: that judge just cant rule in the case right
[12:09:21] Sparty071: He wasn't robbing him he had an RP planned out with cornwood.
[12:09:22] geo_logic_: just means she cant be the judge on the case, but that happens all the time and should happen
[12:09:22] kylef_: essaying
[12:09:23] EmDuBB13: absolutely
[12:09:23] jinnytolls: Its better to clarify first so the case is solid
[12:09:25] deja_entendeuce: scuff arrests need to be treated differently
[12:09:25] Phage_Cleaver: @EsfandTV I think the RP that comes from this will be great. Because K will be on his devil shit
[12:09:25] Taykum64: I think the actual funniest part of tonight and the focus should be the fact you lied to cover up your Field officer and then this all transpired. I think absolutely no one should be upsetti spaghetti and just look at the funny bits.
[12:09:26] deftcg: deftcg subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! Absolutely loved the past few months of rp
[12:09:27] jokerm21: you were trying to do the right thing but at that point they were way past finding the right charges
[12:09:29] walnutszs: yall should be consulting your attourney not the judges
[12:09:34] MahanGM: chat debate peepoPopcorn
[12:09:35] moose_916_: You should have never been involved. You were the victim of the crime
[12:09:36] BBCapitalist: @xblasphemye definitely shouldnt have had the convo in front of k, who misunderstood his intentions immediately lol
[12:09:37] x_juiceman: Should‚Äôve just spoken to a judge before presenting any charges to K
[12:09:37] oofinside: lookUp lack of emotes
[12:09:38] TarvusPlz: @stoohs You should check out Lord_Kebuns channel then :D
[12:09:41] MahanGM: chat debaters peepoPopcorn
[12:09:42] LegitBanana_: @EsfandTV if the judge said that wouldnt stick then itd be okay OMEGALAUGHING
[12:09:43] DaZooKidd420: Knowing that he just shot 2 people one being a judge and then bringing up a judge was a mistake so EVERYONE messed up here not just slacks @esfandtv
[12:09:45] droksid00: Prosecutors AND defense attorneys talk to judges before trials chat. just talking outta your ass.
[12:09:47] Pandrax86: @PaullyBryant I think they should of done what cornwood said and NOT charge him and let him go for now and then they can bring him back later and finalize charges.
[12:09:47] droksid00: in real life
[12:09:48] PokeMom019: Instead of vinewood it needs to say cornwood
[12:09:49] driver1036: He was looking for you for 2 days
[12:09:50] walnutszs: theres a giant part of the legal process nopixel doesnt address and it causes alot of issues
[12:09:50] ZuldeadTV: I dunno man in the long run it would've happened anyway, with other streamer, maybe a guy with 10 viewers, and then no one would care
[12:09:50] yaboygrumbles: So moral of the story is we shouldn‚Äôt let Bay drive the Scout
[12:09:50] kylef_: lack of Joel
[12:09:51] soosmaz74: @Phage_Cleaver yes
[12:09:51] GlibWizard: @walnutszs the cops are the prosecutors there is no DA LULW
[12:09:52] xshagwagonx: IRL where i live they call a magistrate literally at a traffic stop
[12:09:52] HellaBitter: esfandCozy Thank you for the amazing content @EsfandTV
[12:09:53] BigglesVII: What you did was the right thing. It's paved the way for the PD to raise their standards and to do things right.
[12:09:53] RaunchyOLDwoman: You just need to get all the charges together, The whole Menu, BEFORE you talk to the suspect about ANY charges.
[12:09:53] DrWetbone: if you take account of streamers irl wants rp server would be a hostage to ooc conflict, it‚Äôs probably better to just play the game as it is
[12:09:54] Wallsh_: Bro did crime and now we feel bad
[12:09:54] striggly_diggly: Joel Jammies Joel Û†ÄÄ
[12:09:55] Wynter282: yea to be honest once slacks started down that road just let it play out if he fucks it up he fucks it up and you just talk about it after he has done dealing with it, but K really wasnt helping himself at all either so it was just all a big mess
[12:09:55] LilMoistMeat: Joel
[12:09:56] Moregorilla: On the flip side it went bad but that all a part of RP.. unintended consequences
[12:09:56] xblasphemye: @BBCapitalist maybe, but its also on SLacks to have a backbone or know better. hes in a position of leadership
[12:09:57] Taykum64: The Black Bronco, Terror of the North,
[12:09:57] JohnDoeRadio: SourPls Dont let the chatters get to yah mang
[12:09:57] IWezzerI: Doesn't help that when u was explaining your point at the start people was interrupting you that's what sent it off course @esfandtv
[12:09:58] rickytickygames: I think you were right talking about following procedure. HOWEVER it was too late at the point. Trying to follow procedure after the shitshow ruined everything after
[12:09:58] xkingdelta: No you was right but slacks started it off wrong by saying they are dropping the pd charge from the get go should have said full charge time and fine then work down like you said it's an easy interpretation just skipped steps and I think k got confused and thought more time was being added
[12:09:58] DaltonCL: im just here to spam THIS and GETALIFE
[12:09:58] TielerWindsong: @Vasaria honestly that is the play its all about impact. Shooting a cop really only puts that player down for a bit. Stealing PD guns screws over civs becasue then they get robbed by those same guns
[12:10:01] kylef_: essaying
[12:10:01] walnutszs: there should be a DA is my point
[12:10:02] MrActivated: People think that ur were adding extra charges bc of the money @EsfandTV
[12:10:04] BigCumulonimbus: You did right. The situation was fucked. Hopefully people learn from this, but we gotta move on
[12:10:04] kennypowersyall: essaying Û†ÄÄ
[12:10:05] sevenonesmith: if u talk to to judge isn‚Äôt gay bias against the other person
[12:10:06] JoeSizzle7: Everyone does things differently though. Cornwood should respect not getting his way
[12:10:06] justantoherwarlock1: how does one come up with 1400 min charge?
[12:10:07] staynsalty: Slacks is fed up with Mr K to I think
[12:10:07] HARD_DUB: def more Joel
[12:10:08] Perne78: If if K loses criminally, he can probably sue civil since the Victim was pressing the charges
[12:10:08] ZuldeadTV: at least the server can look into it now
[12:10:09] LilMoistMeat: i see Joel i type Joel
[12:10:11] oofinside: lookDown peeTime
[12:10:11] TheDarkNyet: it was a good learning experience
[12:10:11] kylef_: Joel Joel Joel
[12:10:12] Tsithik: i really wanted to hear him tell the story ngl
[12:10:13] MahanGM: this is real life dammit Smadge
[12:10:13] DaltonCL: Joel
[12:10:18] Cthyllah: the fact of the matter is, no one thinks k should have been sent to prison for that long and no one is saying that he should have been so severely punished. everyone just got really confused and this is what happened. but everyone needs to stop acting like this was malicious and intentional. it was a mistake.
[12:10:19] soosmaz74: Joel
[12:10:19] coldan01: Joel
[12:10:20] CuIdra: @rivath that's not what I asked. I asked is it policy to present the entire menu first then take off charges ? Like official PD policy
[12:10:21] kylef_: Joel
[12:10:21] kennypowersyall: Joel
[12:10:22] nlwatcher: k is cool, saab is cool, and k will make some lit shit happen in prison, im sure of it. Honestly drama is mad engaging
[12:10:23] Joongi_: Anyways, FF7 Thursday Okayge
[12:10:25] imfukinlost: Ron Mexico time
[12:10:26] Daegalll: I have bad takes and use 10k points to share them dentt
[12:10:27] Zarniwooper: I'm so sad that the planned RP didn't happen, would have been epic. I hope he doesn't get discouraged.
[12:10:27] CookieCutter_101: it is what it is
[12:10:32] geo_logic_: but its important to know for the future
[12:10:32] Doqx42: just seems like Slacks is never willing to make his character develop how they forced Cornwood to do something different
[12:10:34] Exotic_Soul: david littleman PogU
[12:10:35] HARD_DUB: 4Shrug too many chefs chefin??
[12:10:35] Sweet_BabyJeebus: @esfandtv you explain perfectly to chat but not in character
[12:10:36] xblasphemye: @BBCapitalist yeah you cant talk in front of a suspect at all like that. its going to make you look weak and disorganized and dumb
[12:10:37] BBCapitalist: @xblasphemye very true
[12:10:38] sealemons: sealemons subscribed at Tier 1. 
[12:10:38] RomanNumera: Slacks got so confused because he was only half listening to what you were saying. He assumed you wanted to throw the book at him when that's not at all what you wanted.
[12:10:38] MahanGM: so lets play alan wake 1 & 2
[12:10:39] slomojosh: that would‚Äôve set a bad precedent in front of the PPOs
[12:10:39] 1vivy: gentlemans agreement about charging later would be cool but there's precedent why that doesnt happen unfortunately
[12:10:39] GlibWizard: FeelsStrongMan Ali Jamshidi
[12:10:40] droksid00: @EsfandTV no, its good you did. You can correct this now and move forward. It would have just happened later on
[12:10:40] heavyd834: slacks shouldn't have kept pressing when it was clear K wasn't going to cooperate
[12:10:42] Leafyerick: @EsfandTV It wasn't just you though. It upset other cops that it wasn't being pushed
[12:10:45] fourtwantea: Why was cornwood in interrogation if he was the victim?
[12:10:49] Vasaria: @xblasphemye thats exactly my point, the RP he wanted was perfect.  hes being punished harsher for doing real RP and not just running around gunning everyone down.
[12:10:49] Brick_Brown: like slacks said though this was a learning experience
[12:10:50] sealemons: @EsfandTV I think DOJ should remove "stacking" meaning officers no longer have to be scared to put every cahrge forward BEFORE arguing plea deals.
[12:10:50] MahanGM: ALAN WAKE 1, 2 RN Smadge
[12:10:51] Cult_personality: but slacks also said you were free to push for the charges,  so like where didi it fail?
[12:10:51] Sparty071: He wanted to do some rp with cornwood. His plan was not to rob him but disarm him. Tessa was pissed he killed a dolphin
[12:10:52] deja_entendeuce: it was a scuff induced arrest enough said
[12:10:53] EmDuBB13: you were trying to help him from getting fucked
[12:10:55] sundevil40: 
[12:10:59] antthemadgamer: This is why I agree with having a District Attorney it can make things like this so much easier to deal with
[12:11:00] MrActivated: @EsfandTV nah u did the right thing because now they know what u were trying to prove
[12:11:01] Rivath: @CuIdra It's policy to give the correct charges and they can use discretion to bargain it down yeah
[12:11:02] walnutszs: there should be a cop lawyer on every shift and his only job is to confirm charges and work with the DOJ so the cops dont have to and yall arnt stuck in the cells for 3 hours
[12:11:04] BigglesVII: Thing is it's normal for Cornwood to intervene. It was good rp
[12:11:09] ZuldeadTV: @sundevil40 esfandL
[12:11:09] jinnytolls: 1. Stories and charges werent lined up 2. noone said lets talk outside the room until it was too late 3. Mr. K is a pro mud slinger and was given alot of space to argue his own charges @EsfandTV
[12:11:09] oofinside: yeah both frost and bay agreed with you LULE
[12:11:11] kayc_luv: kayc_luv subscribed at Tier 1. 
[12:11:12] BBCapitalist: @Sparty071 oh is that how the whole thing started?
[12:11:13] CptTimberwolf: esfandL
[12:11:13] Pandrax86: @RomanNumera pretty much it.
[12:11:17] Exotic_Soul: @Cult_personality it failed when they told Mr K at first it wasnt getting a valid charge here when it was
[12:11:17] zmarska: Aleast u realise the bigger picture, som guys just dont realise the impact this can have. And now sadly someone gets a soft 3 day ban.
[12:11:17] TheFairn: slacks needs to be a lawyer for a week to learn this stuff, he made everything confusing
[12:11:18] ben_v_art: I think you were doing it right, it makes sense to push everything fist then work um down.
[12:11:18] xkingdelta: No way esfand you know it was right
[12:11:22] MahanGM: can't please everyone esfand LULW
[12:11:22] itzcookiebtw: @sundevil40 you a real one
[12:11:25] Vaddix0056: did he even get charge at all be for the storm? after all this BS
[12:11:26] Leafyerick: Leafyerick gifted a Tier 1 sub to sundevil40! They have given 783 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[12:11:28] 1vivy: oh man the Tessa stuff would have been awesome don't spoil it
[12:11:29] CuIdra: @rivath ok thank you. This isn't the first time I've seen them start with the streamlined charges so I wasn't sure.
[12:11:30] BrockLeeSwag: esfandL
[12:11:31] thevaultdweller55: @Leafyerick  there has been no lootboxing, only one person actually lootboxed and was banned for 7 days and it was client, if crims dont do crime the whole city will be grinder zombies
[12:11:33] 1vivy: might still happen
[12:11:34] xblasphemye: @RomanNumera Slacks really dropped the ball by not showing more leadership skills here.
[12:11:34] icrlym: In my head, I picture your way like a receipt from a purchase. You see the charges the total cost of those charges and you see the discount, then the new total.
[12:11:35] jdotno: just because you can doesn't mean you shoumd
[12:11:35] TimmayHS: Slacks should get demoted for that situation imo
[12:11:36] Scrando: ssaab said he agrees too, that was a mistake
[12:11:36] Candor_Circus: I really like the new hat. Cowboy0
[12:11:37] EmDuBB13: and slacks literally CornWall
[12:11:39] slomojosh: that‚Äôs not on you for Slacks jumping the entire gun though
[12:11:39] HARD_DUB: jinxed it
[12:11:41] BUTHEDD_: THE MOOD IS TENSE DAM
[12:11:41] oofinside: you and bay stressed the fuck out xdd
[12:11:41] MahanGM: esfand you can't please everyone FeelsOkayMan
[12:11:42] JoeSizzle7: It only happened because the seeds were planted in Mr. K's head
[12:11:43] 420warlock: he got confused and it spiraled
[12:11:44] Wallsh_: ITS JUST RP.  HE DID THE CRIME AND HE DOES THE TIME.  BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME
[12:11:44] JasonMunday: It's already in the past, learn from it, go forward with what was learned, create more great RP GIGACHAD
[12:11:45] Doqx42: At least now Bobby and Carmine have someone there
[12:11:47] Perne78: so you knew it was gonna happen and still went through with your savior arc?
[12:11:48] Joongi_: @sundevil40 I went in there for a while and is actually very normal and funny, just a few people being weird esfandL
[12:11:48] Sweet_BabyJeebus: It is what it is
[12:11:52] heinousanus95: Slacks shouldve been willing to wait 5 minutes before laying everything out to check what you were saying. The charges hadnt been presented yet @esfandtv
[12:11:52] GlitchyGunZ: can‚Äôt say you didn‚Äôt warn  them. @esfandtv
[12:11:54] shizbang_: that arc is ruined lmao not happening now
[12:11:55] Rivath: @CuIdra The problem is Slacks didn't seem to know that DNA meant possession 100% for some reason
[12:11:57] 420warlock: I got confused too, shit. it seemed like the plea were the original charges
[12:11:57] tr3ywaytr3yway: rogerpenske3 subscribed with Prime. 
[12:11:58] saucy_swan: Hot dog, what did I miss? I just got here.
[12:12:00] MrActivated: PD morale low Sadge
[12:12:01] Raja_Banhammer: problem is now mr k thinks cornwood is stacking charges maliciously
[12:12:03] xblasphemye: @Vasaria I agree and that is a Server issue that needs to be addressed for sure!!!
[12:12:03] Pandrax86: @thevaultdweller55 CG has been lootboxing turbos for over a week now with no RP or interaction.
[12:12:03] sabinstha1: will u agree to get kidnaped n do rp with tessa?
[12:12:04] TheSlike123: @Pandrax86 just woke up an hour ago so i joined at the moment Mr. K refused to talk but i still get both sides and i get why both esfand and kebun got upset. what streamers should always do is clearify their ooc feelings with chat so the hoppers dont mix between ooc feelings and rp
[12:12:05] Zarniwooper: There needs to be a crim rob option to turn off the tracker
[12:12:06] condor2104: mistakes were made by everyone.  shit happens.  there needs to be training period on proper cell charges.
[12:12:06] xkingdelta: Needs to be said in the pd meeting then right all charges put forth first then negotiating
[12:12:06] awildpog: K is NOT OOC mad, but the justice system is a bit much (3 days IRL for creating some cool content in a video game)
[12:12:08] Mic_Stargazer: @thevaultdweller55 There's a difference between "don't do crime" and "don't constantly do the few crimes that have the largest chargest over and over and build up heat on the same gun you're too afraid to throw away" lol
[12:12:08] walnutszs: @thevaultdweller55 100% correct

[12:12:16] Perne78: the hot gun wasn't even the problem lol

[12:12:19] xblasphemye: @TheFairn agreed
[12:12:19] Orbilion: If corn could then corn would
[12:12:20] MrActivated: PD is out of mana Sadge
[12:12:22] TXCVulture: Silly guy
[12:12:24] kayc_luv: I feel bad that you feel bad. I‚Äôm a chat hopper and don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs cool to crap on ppl because they disagree with you
[12:12:25] jdotno: he wanted that gun
[12:12:25] DaltonCL: FF7R soon Clueless
[12:12:28] Chaoszero_goc: The hot gun didnt do anything. It was the police gun
[12:12:28] nekodon1: Ramee did the same thing he had a hot as shit gun on him
[12:12:29] sundevil40: Nah he chillin
[12:12:30] yaboygrumbles: Did he genuinely not know that gun was hot?
[12:12:30] science_envisions: remove "umbrella charge" from your vocab
[12:12:30] walnutszs: he was hot as it was happening
[12:12:31] TielerWindsong: he was def salty irl lol
[12:12:31] zeldaspirit: he also got a bad plan all around
[12:12:31] Kolipto: @EsfandTV You positivity and focus on doing the right things is why a lot of us can relate to you and how you role play. Thank you for being you. Don't be too hard on yourself.
[12:12:33] Leafyerick: Esfand feels shitty OOC Sadeg
[12:12:37] Raja_Banhammer: Sadeg
[12:12:37] nosnese476: even if it's not a formal demotion, it seems as though cornwood's authority will not supersede slacks
[12:12:38] itchy_bubba: in 4.0 you have to serve the time in game it will take like 5 days for k to serve the time
[12:12:39] ULTRAKona_: GETALIFE GIVE THE PLEBS 60 SECONDS WideHardo
[12:12:40] xxtrupaul6x: they should add a way to combat dna and fingerprints on things

[12:12:43] Felaryn: @kayc_luv esfandL
[12:12:44] HellaBitter: it was that damn dark in colored buffalo's fault *shakes fist*
[12:12:45] oofinside: imagine that guy who got 21days for doing nothing Pain
[12:12:47] EmDuBB13: the hot gun was dumb for sure
[12:12:47] Sparty071: Yep that's why K kidnapped cornwood. Animal cruelty
[12:12:47] HoeTown: this is a take a step back and talk about it later situation
[12:12:48] sundevil40: Hes mad at the system not the cops
[12:12:48] nlwatcher: hes already got a phone, he‚Äôs fine. Fire rp will happen around that incarceration.
[12:12:49] ben_v_art: its not you though, just the server rules need balancing looked at more
[12:12:49] 420warlock: too bad you couldn‚Äôt over rule all of them and gotten it cleared tf up but it wasn‚Äôt gonna go good if u tried any more than you did.
[12:12:49] timedoggg: the hot gun didn't even matter. He got hit with a 3 day soft ban trying to do a rp story line with cornwood @EsfandTV
[12:12:51] Zinzio: 3 day soft ban for attempted dolphin RP
[12:12:51] jdotno: he wanted to admit to everything with that gun
[12:12:51] Perne78: the hot gun was less than a tenth of the time and charges... it was the possession that you were pushing that was the major damage there
[12:12:52] walnutszs: K can support himself. The point is this shouldnt be happening
[12:12:53] choalol: a 3 day soft ban for making rp is crazy imo
[12:12:54] JasonMunday: OkayChamp üëç understand how you feel
[12:12:55] Joeeee: Have you just tried messaging him about it? im sure he aint that mad at you lol
[12:12:56] j1zzard: the gun wasnt even the biggest charge time wise so who cares
[12:12:56] mattchutt: im sure hes a little frustrated too.. it was 3 hours of backtracking and this or that
[12:12:58] ZuldeadTV: You're a great person man esfandL get some rest I guess, play some FF7R, dunno...
[12:12:59] TheSlike123: @EsfandTV what streamers should always do is clearify their ooc feelings with chat so the hoppers dont mix between ooc feelings and rp
[12:12:59] Apocco: just wonder if you were too worried about the ooc stuff to fully rp considering you were the one that got taken and robbed...rp you should've wanted all charges pressed fully
[12:13:00] xblasphemye: @condor2104 trueeee
[12:13:02] AlexSamaAU: the fact hes been robbing police for weeks and is only jsut now facing 3 days isnt bad, if he got caught at different points same time served but wouldve been spread out
[12:13:04] GreedNweeD: üê¨
[12:13:05] DaZooKidd420: Only gun he had ammo for he always carries it
[12:13:05] dholdren12: everyone else is chilling ooc and i feel like you let it get to too much
[12:13:06] CuIdra: Mistakes happen. The biggest issue is being locked out of a character for so long. That should really change
[12:13:06] Kowlineos: Have no Idea why criminals keep using these hot Guns, they should probably get rid of It after one use , Just like in Real Life
[12:13:08] Joongi_: I get it man, but I mean, he did the things and he messed up, like... What can you do, just let him go? shrujj
[12:13:11] WarrenPuffit: yeah I mean IC cornwood just made an enemy forsure but that‚Äôll lead to some good content
[12:13:11] SumDee_LumDee: meeting room
[12:13:12] elSilvan: K's gunna destroy carmine and bobby in there and have a great time
[12:13:14] soosmaz74: u feel like u have done him wrong well u should not it was just s miscommunication between all parties
[12:13:16] BigCumulonimbus: If only that buffalo didn‚Äôt injure Bay. All this would be avoided
[12:13:18] Phage_Cleaver: @Zinzio Yo no spoilers
[12:13:21] deja_entendeuce: shoulda ooced "lets keep in mind mr k is arrested bc of scuff"
[12:13:22] Wallsh_: Need that OOC barrier
[12:13:23] Adelyssaelis: Guys lets not forget why the charges were increased in the first place, cops were getting robbed 10+ times a day, you dont want a 3 day soft ban? dont rob cops and use the guns its not that hard
[12:13:24] BigglesVII: It was sloppy using the hot gun but he was overconfident and didn't think he would get caught. He took the risk and it didn't pay off this time.
[12:13:24] DiscretionaI: Does NP not have patch notes (or something similar) to expand awareness of mechanics?
[12:13:26] EmDuBB13: you can hold cleetus up witha wrench dude
[12:13:27] xblasphemye: @xkingdelta and to never let a suspect hear you talking you cant talk in front of a suspect ever
[12:13:28] codyjohnson766: laws shouldn‚Äôt be made to punish a streamer for 3 days. not your fault. sucks cause there was legit rp behind it.
[12:13:28] HARD_DUB: Listening
[12:13:29] aznxprd: aznxprd subscribed with Prime. 
[12:13:30] nlwatcher: I wish the kidnapping was a success. It was built up days ago, i was excited to see what happened. It was about the dolphin  killin lolololol
[12:13:30] RomanNumera: To be fair, it's not that you didn't explain it well, it's that people didn't listen well and thought you were saying something you weren't.
[12:13:31] walnutszs: guns arnt necessarily easy to get either.
[12:13:31] drkuddly_: At least it wasn‚Äôt Dundee LUL
[12:13:34] mattchutt: esfandL
[12:13:35] demonqp: 
[12:13:36] BrockLeeSwag: @Kowlineos I think the problem is with not there being alot of guns they are kinda forced to use more hot guns.
[12:13:37] ben_v_art: way to big IRL impact on people for a fun RP content server
[12:13:40] amavadin: glajj banjoTime
[12:13:42] xblasphemye: @Kolipto Facts
[12:13:45] thevaultdweller55: @Mic_Stargazer so that justies 150k fine and 3 days soft ban? he can just go around shooting people instead and hardly get charged. and im out of channel points lmao so i cant send anymore messages
[12:13:46] Turquoise_River: Buffalo Butterfly affect üêÉ
[12:13:48] Perne78: literally killing a judge and a council member with that hot gun was less time and fine than having the possession charge
[12:13:51] aznxprd: @esfandtv Slacks handled the whole situation terribly as a captain. He needs to get demoted or barred from processing CG ever again.
[12:13:51] eduopai: the chat was attacking Esfand at some point and thats lame
[12:13:52] Leafyerick: @Apocco No it's in character for Cornwood to want to be fair with charges whether he's the victim or not
[12:13:52] 420warlock: I mean he was getting ballsy bc he‚Äôs been going wild lately and not gotten got in a minute lol
[12:13:54] iwannanuhh: Bro people are saying Soft Ban over and over. What do you think Crim RP entails??
[12:14:00] draacx: Samuel L Jackson goes to prison tomorrow
[12:14:01] 420warlock: DONT TELL HIM WHAT IT IS ABOUT
[12:14:03] ZuldeadTV: UltraMad you're not supposed to know about that
[12:14:03] Rivath: Let's be honest here... it was the PD car that screwed him over and dumped him in the river in the first place
[12:14:03] Scrando: Thank god ramee isn‚Äôt still a lawyer or that would have been a bigger disaster kekw
[12:14:04] walnutszs: you want them using hot guns though. It helps support investigative rp
[12:14:05] draacx: keep him company
[12:14:06] Gahbij: all because of a dolphin Aware
[12:14:07] mfam_lp: the kidnapping was not planned you were just on the side of the road. the game scuffed where you couldnt sign out and he couldnt get away.  the charges are valid he was working with slacks to get less time if he admitted to something else but all the charges werent ready to be read and so it felt like he was adding things after he offered to tell on himself. he shut down and slacks got upset and threw the book at him
[12:14:08] 420warlock: ITS TOO GOOD TO RUIN!!!!
[12:14:10] deafguy87: peepoScared PianoTime
[12:14:12] WarrenPuffit: @aznxprd it‚Äôs not that serious HAHAHA
[12:14:15] Phage_Cleaver: @EsfandTV I dont think Cornwood should know that esfandScoots
[12:14:15] Bulletproof_santa: Wait he knows why?
[12:14:18] Kowlineos: @brockleeswag I thought that they were able to craft Guns or something
[12:14:20] Joongi_: ABOBA El Tesso
[12:14:21] TheNachoManRandyCabbage: i like slacks, but this is on him. His names on the report. Let him deal with the negative effect
[12:14:22] Grallus: No meta about dolphin.
[12:14:22] karaskyee: Vincent my beloved
[12:14:24] JoeSizzle7: Whenever somebody doesn't take Cornwood's advice he correlates that to them not listening. People are allowed to disagree
[12:14:27] Wallsh_: Oh no the consequences of my ACTIONS

[12:14:44] Mic_Stargazer: @thevaultdweller55 Consider this. He spent weeks going up to sani workers and auto-winning with a gun stealing hours upon hours of THEIR time back to back to back, their LIMITED server time. Where's their justice?
[12:14:45] xkingdelta: Love you cornwood sending the good feels
[12:14:46] TheSlike123: @eduopai happens all the time when the streamer pepole watch has something negative happen to them

[12:14:51] DieterK: take off sub only mode pls Prayge
[12:14:52] Mic_Stargazer: There should honestly be a way to mess with jail time, like if you're not on that character the time speeds up or something if it's over X amount of time initially the time can be sped up that way.
[12:14:53] Joongi_: OUTTAPOCKET Do not mention it's name
[12:14:54] HARD_DUB: i remember the good ol days where Cornwood & Mr. K owned a house together NOOO
[12:14:56] nekodon1: @EsfandTV cornwood did find, Slacks just keep trying to preach and act like good cop and not doing charges right
[12:14:57] Perne78: but as a victim in the scenario that wasn't really where your head should have been on this one
[12:14:58] Zarniwooper: On the other hand, K has had some big W's lately too. But boring prison is just stupid mechanism.
[12:14:59] caroline_1331: how is this fixing the justice system
[12:14:59] Cthyllah: k seems to just be mad about how he

[12:15:07] s1cKNation: i feel like another rebirth is coming soon
[12:15:07] The_Strix01: Cant Mr K just get off with all the other stuff with an alibi? Theres only evidence the gun was there and none that he was there.
[12:15:08] Pee_aRe: freedom
[12:15:10] SavageTarzan: sajj @Felaryn imNOTcrying
[12:15:11] PrettyKrazy: every time he pulled that trigger he risked a character perma dying. idk why we gotta downplay it just becuase ppl dont actually wanna perma. gun rp consequences are important

[12:15:40] BrockLeeSwag: @Kowlineos maybe im not sure about that but i thought they were like crazy expensive to get. So its almost worse.
[12:15:40] h8t0r: You focused on the process, and sought to be consistent. Yet your efforts were neither understood at the time, nor were they appreciated.... Doing the righteous thing and being punished only pushes to the limit.

[12:17:29] claptil: Chief BJ
[12:17:29] kylef_: o7 chief
[12:17:31] ABirky: @shizbang_ I mean, He just got pardoned by the Mayor for the charge that fucked him initially, then he went and did this? He kinda ended that arc himself tbh
[12:17:34] Scrando: xdd chief is gonna love this
[12:17:34] lunchablle: he took it all to make a point 3 days is excessive for anybody
[12:17:34] DeeVee_TV: Flushing that pardon down the toilet in record time
[12:17:34] thecoach33: his character can‚Äôt backdown that point he Mr.K
[12:17:35] krimsin360: @Rog1veN that system is only in place because shit crims who want to treat the city like their own personal anarchy simulator pushed it into existence
[12:17:35] ilmarcusil: @arckon 3 day jail for Mr. L
[12:17:35] misslemonsx: I think you did right because he got caught and he got the right charges but kinda feel a little robbed of the roleplay shouldn‚Äôt the priority be getting to the bottom of all the unsolved cases and hearing that roleplay be more important to the officers?
[12:17:35] Mr_Mikeys: I'm sure he didn't want too talk. Some big people werre involved
[12:17:36] CapoOnLive: o7 PD
[12:17:37] szble: why would he be afraid of some time in prison
[12:17:37] Raja_Banhammer: Would Mr K even tell the truth even if things were done correctly? My guess is no
[12:17:37] fatwinz: he was trying to rp the story of why you were kidnapped but no deal was ever tabled
[12:17:38] rattler_2828: normally I agree with do the crime do the time but a 3 day soft ban seems extra
[12:17:38] soIoleveling: 3 days is still wild regardless what you do, its essentially a ban
[12:17:38] zeroxschneider: I am curious, Should Cornwood even be there for charges since he was the victim?
[12:17:39] heinousanus95: Yeah chat it sucks that he got 3 days because he got too cooked and died on the hill
[12:17:39] facelessXfactor: Towards the end it was ooc he was over it all been sitting for 3 hrs
[12:17:39] Kalious78: Don't blame k trying to justify it, you corned too hard and pressed and pressed for hours instead of letting it play out
[12:17:40] dluo15: k was clearly mad because 3 days is just stupid like cmon
[12:17:40] polercap: Mr k as a character is a big escalator so It tracks lol
[12:17:41] sircrumpler: cinnaHop
[12:17:41] caroline_1331: 3000 minutes cause the pd have their trackers implanted in their butts, you also missed out on some fire rp
[12:17:42] markymarcc1: Tbf if he just mag dumped  cornwood none of this would happen tbf
[12:17:42] geo_logic_: but also he was going to spend that time in jail either way. better to sit there and rp
[12:17:42] Sahgos: @Arckon Should just be on 24 hours tbh Kappa

[12:17:46] MattMane262: @esfandtv I‚Äôm a Fan of both you and K. Ignore the hater‚Äôs in chat please. you work to hard to let it bum you out.
[12:17:47] bangsssss: but then also staying in the room with mr K whilst discussing what charges are what makes it open for problems
[12:17:47] kalwin90: Esfand brother
[12:17:49] AlexSamaAU: the fact hes been robbing police for weeks and is only just now facing 3 days isnt bad, if he got caught at different points same time served but wouldve been spread out
[12:17:51] Zinzio: Bro he had a great rp reason and didn't want you to pull a cornwood.
[12:17:52] dugy6: bro yall left him in there for 3 hours to double his time is why he was pissed
[12:17:53] HeyMeghan: and now cornwood‚Äôs life is put in danger bc slacks skipped to the end bc it looks like he got the extra charges added on.
[12:17:54] hvanity: Why would K want to talk when he feels like charges kept escalating. He was going to tell the story
[12:17:56] CuIdra: I can see why he didn't take the deal from Mr Ks perspective tbf.

[12:18:04] Luthercorpz: The City Council voted on it too though so not like you can take away that RP
[12:18:05] Scrando: it would be nice if there was a lot to do in jail RP wise
[12:18:05] deafguy87: YEP
[12:18:06] 1manpizza: It's balanced around having less active guns on the server
[12:18:06] bluey_28: thats because slacks and ruth are stupid cornwood.. he shouldnt have gotten a month
[12:18:06] Sahgos: very true
[12:18:07] madhatterui: 100%

[12:18:20] jmangaman: all crims do is create rp
[12:18:20] WarrenPuffit: so ur justified
[12:18:21] HeyItsChe: That's bullshit too, all leads to 0.4 being the issue
[12:18:21] Cthyllah: i think hes just mad that if he would have shot you / tried to kill you, it would have been a smaller punishment than just kidnapping you
[12:18:22] RietArtwork: YEP
[12:18:22] MrChow223: but jail is literally nothing
[12:18:22] DocRavage: that's kind of a weird take imo. K was jsut RPing.
[12:18:23] Phage_Cleaver: Well not as Denzel LUL
[12:18:23] h8t0r: @Arckon Cornwood sought to process a situation correctly, with consistency: enumerating all charges prior to negotiations. However, his righteous effort was in vein, and he's now catching blowback, as a result.
[12:18:23] rattler_2828: at least he could rp
[12:18:24] Zinzio: He could still play and rp. K is locked in a prison. Not the same at all
[12:18:24] BUTHEDD_: but thats the den situation xdd
[12:18:25] ImRolliePollie: a month is purely idiotic in most circumstances
[12:18:26] ZeeMacNA: he still rp tho he does 1 lifers an stuff
[12:18:26] Crosstak: @blazerox play another character
[12:18:27] Datursa: Pretty sure he was talking and willing to work out a deal before trying to add more charges KEKW
[12:18:27] slomojosh: i literally think Slacks is just anti Cornwood at this point
[12:18:28] vROJIROv: because he made a 1 lifer and a has a crim character bruh
[12:18:28] boomershow824: Denzel didnt go to prison
[12:18:28] Tsithik: the thing is den could have RP'd his char doing anything else in the world. stuck in jail there aint shit to do
[12:18:28] facelessXfactor: Denzel also plays other characters LK has 1 character
[12:18:29] Stankyfinga: !song
[12:18:29] wizardnok: he could still walk around the city not locked in a box with nothing to do and no RP what are you talking about its not even close to the same
[12:18:29] welitcuhh: DEN NEVER WOKE UP LUL
[12:18:30] The805King: he could rp in the city tho rn jail rp doesn't exist
[12:18:30] Dylan_Be_Chillin: 100% true but den can still rp unlike K
[12:18:30] SoLDiER510: It is what it is. Cornwood still has a job to do
[12:18:30] pheaturelol: yeah but he got to run around and still enjoy the city and RP, its alot different than sitting in prison for 3 days alone for 90% of the time.
[12:18:30] awildpog: lootboxing cops is bannable though
[12:18:32] Undead_Frankie: Justin Aware
[12:18:32] Phoenix_Avaa: ehhh
[12:18:33] aaronalford24: But Denzel could still do stuff he chose not too. Not the same thing
[12:18:33] Pakkasparkers: Mr K got presentented many outs and didnt take them
[12:18:33] TheNachoManRandyCabbage: they need to do away with prison and make them do community service
[12:18:34] shum7: k did crime and got caught, if it was a small streamer no one would question it
[12:18:34] soIoleveling: He was in the city tho and had his other character who was already established as a crim @esfandtv
[12:18:34] Capacchino: Yeah but in fairness. Denzel just got a month off of PD and explored the city...K has to sit and wait basically
[12:18:35] JuggernuttzICBM: is this the soundtrack from silent hill?
[12:18:35] jdiehr: bad from a cop rp perspective.
[12:18:35] fatguy27: crimes are high risk no reward
[12:18:36] Fozenoh: WHY ARE CHATTERS SAYING "got 3 days for doing RP" WHAT?
[12:18:37] illuminat4242: What about the person that sit for 21 days in jail
[12:18:37] Luthercorpz: Can't really take City Hall RP and laws way at a whim
[12:18:37] gavinshane: i think its crazy 3 days in jail bc that means the streamer them selfs cant get good content idk im new to whole rp scene kinda
[12:18:38] Mic_Stargazer: Do you think some kind of time multiplier could work for jail times over like 12 hours or something? If you're offline on that character, the time speeds up so you're still punished but can also choose jail RP if you want @EsfandTV
[12:18:38] u23power: it sends the message not to rp with cops
[12:18:38] 3ezzzz: he has two characters tho he kept switching between them
[12:18:38] Prepper_Jack: Dunno, it's a bit crazy to say K was escalating after PD from his perspective wasted 3 of his hours to triple the charges
[12:18:39] killas09: guess cornwood doesnt fit anywhere
[12:18:39] rattler_2828: mr.k will be staring at a wall kekw
[12:18:40] luckerooni: crims largely accept the consequences of their actions before they do them and are given upfront notice what happens its up to them to do the rp
[12:18:41] Wetidiot: @EsfandTV Slacks logic = CAUGHT oh no, i dropped the pd glock .2 seconds before you cuffed me, not possession now CAUGHT
[12:18:42] thecoach33: nor was Denzel trapped in a almost no RP situation in the prison
[12:18:43] esuardi: i think it's justified. No lootboxing should be the norm
[12:18:44] DBerryfin: @RerQ I'm talking OOC perspective. If prison was established he can create rp during his sentence. Not just fix electrical boxes for 2 days
[12:18:44] Crosstak: @pheaturelol play another character
[12:18:47] splooshtasticals: PD over here fighting for freedom from the get go man. Its been a fight.
[12:18:47] smiley123abc: Denzel could still RP in the city. There is nothing to do in jail. Its not comparable
[12:18:49] DieterK: @EsfandTV was xavier not allowed to go in there?? Û†ÄÄ
[12:18:49] d36i: i do kinda think the spirit of the possession law probably wouldnt include moving the gun into the glovebox with no intent to keep or use it
[12:18:49] ogwookie: he was free tho
[12:18:51] polercap: yeah I get the time is to keep people from messing with you guys but jeez thirty minutes an hour would be plenty
[12:18:51] dontgetitdetsiwt: can you take chat off the screen
[12:18:51] CapoOnLive: ‚ÄúWhat am I supposed to do when everything‚Äôs not just handed to me from the pd‚Äù Esfands literally quote trying to play a cig
[12:18:51] warner05: Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.  I swear.
[12:18:51] PeepoOfdaPizza: @EsfandTV  but jail has close to zero things to do at the moment? not the same if K was just unable to do crime for 3 days he has to cook injail self made rp yes?
[12:18:52] kaweka308: Is it just me or does it seem like crane has way too much control over the entire server with regards to how charges work etc???
[12:18:52] Mic_Stargazer: Rested Jail XP OMEGALUL
[12:18:52] Perne78: again spirit of law vs letter of law though.  he wasn't loot boxing you he was trying to disarm you.  Probably should have told you to throw the gun in the trash or something
[12:18:55] NICO_m: the jail system is even done already?
[12:18:56] Grallus: Your bar license really was a blessing and a curse in the end.
[12:18:57] Exorius: @aaronalford24 not if you dont have the police prio to join the city
[12:18:57] yaboygrumbles: I understand he was frustrated but could‚Äôve played ball a bit at the end if 3 days was too much
[12:18:57] Lyssafofissa: I feel like touching a weapon to disarm isn‚Äôt possession and I‚Äôd of been upset too if offered a deal to lower my 40k fine and told it was 150k instead. But it is what it is :(
[12:18:58] droksid00: Well, is that the PD high score on charges?
[12:18:58] krimsin360: @Rog1veN K is such an outstanding crim, this arc involving cornwood fit his personality, and he gets punished because other lazy crims just kill/kidnap cops for the lulz
[12:18:59] Ancients_v: @Prepper_Jack yup
[12:18:59] Asura_Shini: Thing is without trackers and everything its obviously extremely easy to rob cops . or am I wrong about that?
[12:19:00] metagory: this chat is zooming, wow
[12:19:00] bb_woo: No PD for a few days not as bad as empty prison rp lol üòÜ
[12:19:00] ZeeMacNA: @DBerryfin he got more then 2 days
[12:19:00] dapyman: What does Cornwood think what would have been a fair time penalty & fine?
[12:19:02] caroline_1331: 3 days in jail when jail has zero content is ass doh
[12:19:03] Wynter282: nothing Denzel did should have led to a FIRING its just all dumb, having stupid little mistakes add up to literally losing your job is so bad
[12:19:04] codyjohnson766: but a crim is stuck with a jail that has no rp set up, while a cop can go off duty like you did
[12:19:05] 420warlock: if there was stuff to do in prison other than press e over and over then in theory 3 days could be fine considering the crimes
[12:19:06] k_stimz: lootboxing is an OOC issue that should be delt with OOC
[12:19:06] 1manpizza: peepoS Silent hill time
[12:19:06] pheaturelol: @Crosstak ok then denzel coulda played another character too so what was esfands point?
[12:19:07] pennythug: @kaweka308 he does
[12:19:07] ChrisX3M: my 2 cents if the denzel stuff is bad because it can affect ooc income this is also bad regardless of the rp reasons for this
[12:19:07] hvanity: He didn't lootbox you. He disarmed you with the intent to kidnap. Left everything in your truck
[12:19:07] sammelweis: you have to see it from his perspective - he spent 3 hours for his charges to triple - thats nuts
[12:19:07] privatestars: K gonna be forced to rp with bobby OMEGALUL
[12:19:08] TheSlike123: @EsfandTV i feel for you and i hate when pepole get targeted hate for shit they didnt intend/ do
[12:19:09] lunchablle: no way
[12:19:10] themostnuancedchatter: True but he could still rp if you‚Äôre not a cop. Since there is no rp in prison it‚Äôs 3 days of little to none rp.
[12:19:11] BigCumulonimbus: We‚Äôre talking in circles. We gotta move on
[12:19:11] Dylan_Be_Chillin: No
[12:19:12] TaquitoBandido: cops should be held to a higher standard.. thats what they preach to us IRL
[12:19:12] ColtoCola: RP would have been so good if you were able to clock off at paleto
[12:19:13] Sweet_BabyJeebus: He'll be fine
[12:19:14] BruBru561: @esfandtv I think Mr.K played it right true to his character, I wish Cornwood would have stepped in to handle the charges differently because you want to press the law, but cornwood is for the people. much love
[12:19:14] villager271: OMEGALUL
[12:19:18] the_main_burt: i think a good idea would be to let the prison time pass while not being logged onto the server
[12:19:18] OdinTW: Aware forced to rp with bobby
[12:19:19] ogwookie: not stuck in one place I guess
[12:19:19] blazerox: @Crosstak 4Head
[12:19:20] ZuldeadTV: @pheaturelol nah, he had to play another character, his cop character couldn't fit in any other rp circle, everyone had grudges with him
[12:19:20] EpikDrewbie: Okay but Denzel can rp still you can‚Äôt rp on a 3 day ban
[12:19:20] xkingdelta: Esfand how do you feel that pd trackers should be an equipped item rather than when you sign on and it's permanent that way rp can happen if you get captured the only way pd knows your kidnapped is by doing a radio check
[12:19:20] JasonMunday: K was already scheming at the Prison before storm
[12:19:22] GamonKills: if your stream hinges on 1 character that's pretty dangerous
[12:19:22] Greyconnor: Wasn't the dude who can't say no stuck in jail for a week?
[12:19:22] UncleSolar: @EsfandTV All in good heart
[12:19:22] fatwinz: he could still rp as being fired thats a bad example
[12:19:23] brandonrugg: the problem is that‚Äôs basically his only character and he basically loses out on 3 days of pay from his job
[12:19:24] TrojanCorpse: content server tho no ?
[12:19:25] Pakkasparkers: again he brought it on himself by not accepting any deals and being a baby
[12:19:26] dluo15: i dont think anyone wants to sit in an ingame jail for 3 days
[12:19:26] magnets_: then dont walk around with an item that can affect you ooc so willy nilly. actions = consequences @EsfandTV
[12:19:27] GodSpeed_R: Some of these comments make me glad yall are not in positions of power lmfao
[12:19:27] Rog1veN: That's a bad argument. Wtf
[12:19:27] deafguy87: True, but then people would argue, you cant win all the time in RP too OMEGALAUGHING
[12:19:28] aspectofdaze: BabyRage CONCEQUNCES FOR CRIME
[12:19:28] TXCVulture: Bobby and Carmine will make some content
[12:19:28] Loferix: 150k fine is honestly worse than the 3 day jail time
[12:19:29] Liamav: drawbacks of being a GTA streamer only
[12:19:29] Dontthinkson: They put in Bobby Charles and Carmine at the Jail For RP. K wanted a "Job" at the jail. There is RP there
[12:19:30] Felaryn: 3 days wouldn't be bad if the prison had stuff in it
[12:19:30] lunchablle: there is nothing to do in prison and has to be there 3 days
[12:19:32] facelessXfactor: These scenarios are why CG left 3.0 and nopixel got boring when they left
[12:19:33] heinousanus95: @dugy6 please stop acting like K didnt constantly derail the conversation by talking about "cornwoods evidence storage" or "why was cornwood suspended if hes so great an officer." Mfer helped waste his own time too
[12:19:33] jdiehr: who agreed with deans situation though lol not many
[12:19:33] boomershow824: Prison needs more things to do and this would be fine, but theres litterally no one there ever
[12:19:33] slomojosh: @dapyman Cornwoods fairness is pointing out all the charges beforehand and then going from there. that‚Äôs literally all
[12:19:33] Scrando: has Kebun ever had a cop character? that would be interesting
[12:19:34] jebnickle: Why was nothing said about K being shot in the back without provocation?
[12:19:34] PeepoOfdaPizza: jail RP in 4.0? whats the argument there?
[12:19:35] BrockLeeSwag: @OdinTW i would just play other games at that point KEKW
[12:19:36] iwannanuhh: Bro this is DOOMING like crazy. He can rp in prison, when he gets bored of that, he can make a new character and rp that character. Its three days
[12:19:37] metagory: he knowingly took the risk, shrug
[12:19:37] RomanNumera: The time sucks, sure, I think the bigger problem is expecting to work a deal down from one day and ending up with 3.
[12:19:38] helltoraise: Denzel could rp in the world k is locked in prison with no RP to be had
[12:19:38] markymarcc1: The cornroll is undefeated can't wait to see it in action against cg lol
[12:19:39] splitpush: in jail is just not comparable to out of jail tho
[12:19:40] splooshtasticals: I wish they tried being a cop during the struggle. Almost everyone turned tail till after the fact.
[12:19:40] GlitchyGunZ: yeah Mr k definitely could of done some things to avoid his predicament. Slacks too lol. @esfandtv
[12:19:40] x_juiceman: Considering how many cops K has robbed and not been caught the charge is somewhat understandable @esfandtv
[12:19:41] szble: this chat holyy
[12:19:41] ritual1v: deanso4K deanso4K deanso4K deanso4K deanso4K deanso4K
[12:19:42] JJGold: fck around and find out :)
[12:19:42] Serial_Chaos: that‚Äôs not the same equivalent, having K not be allowed to do crime for a month is more on point
[12:19:42] Guruguy69: Duncan wanted that K money instantly too ...tf
[12:19:42] Clivent: actions have consequences
[12:19:42] PrettyKrazy: so? how does it affect his stream going on killing streams? positively. its ups and downs thats how his rp is
[12:19:43] Phage_Cleaver: @ColtoCola I agree that story line was fire
[12:19:43] notdone2: i mean 5 hours of farming lock picks is a great stream DIESOFCRINGE
[12:19:44] Nero_21: @EsfandTV The only bad thing about this entire situation is the overall time he should get $150k but like 100-200 mins in jail 3 whole days for some one is crazy
[12:19:45] smiley123abc: There is no RP in prison. its a RIP for that character
[12:19:45] justinfieldsqb1: he can stream another game or something there‚Äôs rules in place right?
[12:19:45] aaronalford24: Did it effect yours while you were suspended
[12:19:46] soosmaz74: when u guys send criminals to jail there are ways they can find lockpicks to get out of jail
[12:19:46] TwoHandedBells: meow any chatters
[12:19:46] Jungle_Ben: dont wanna effect ur stream? dont do crimes that are heavily discouraged on the server
[12:19:48] Lyssafofissa: I feel like touching a weapon to disarm isn‚Äôt possession and I‚Äôd of been upset too if offered a deal to lower my 40k fine and told it was 150k instead. But it is what it is :( :(
[12:19:48] AShadowOfDarkness: Good RP Denied from Scuff
[12:19:49] CapoOnLive: @scrando he was a detective at one point
[12:19:50] datguud1: crime creates the RP for cops.
[12:19:50] bluey_28: Yes, but he has the option to go around the city and interact with people. K only has concrete to interact with lol
[12:19:51] devilmeikai: The drama will have a positive effect on his stream long term, if you want a silver lining
[12:19:51] warner05: Why can't Kevin have a Jail Party??  Or a Civ character tho?  Like he can still stream.... @esfandtv
[12:19:53] chrisrox22: 3000hrs with bobby and carmine LUL the pd and council gonna die
[12:19:55] Phoenix_Avaa: prison just sucks right now unfortuntley, 3 days of nothing there
[12:19:55] ASPARAGUSruns: Sadeg Lack of emotes
[12:19:55] doggensteinn: johnson went on another server to play PD today cuz he cant get back in NP
[12:19:56] rattler_2828: also there is NO jail RP
[12:19:56] PAID_ACTOR1: offline 4Head
[12:19:56] Sweet_BabyJeebus: Like Denzel, you need an example to change it
[12:19:56] nite0w1: they should allow jailbreaks for more rp potential
[12:19:56] ULTRAKona_: @Mic_Stargazer maybe once a week they could make ppl serve their sentences all at the same time
[12:19:57] zellitan: @themostnuancedchatter thats true, esfand was saying they shoouldnt have tripled but started out that way and get lowered down during the negoations
[12:19:57] sciencemouse1: meow
[12:19:57] potsuie: @Scrando He has a cop named Richardson its actually funny asf
[12:19:58] Crosstak: @pheaturelol yes he could, but also there is a difference between 20 days (for questionable reasons) and 3 days based on clear choices K made
[12:19:58] wavy__________________: same case for be for watching grinders do grime/g6 all day
[12:19:58] bambikillersixtynine: yo
[12:19:59] ikhronlk: the tessa arc rp would have been soooo good
[12:19:59] jeffrey778: i kinda wish the prison was more fleshed out, i kinda wanted to see some good rp from it
[12:20:00] InsecureForSure: now wot?
[12:20:00] Tsithik: when Dean was playing just crim Dean it was enjoyable and fun to watch he could have done the same things on den but was afraid of getting assasinated
[12:20:01] marsmike918: Hell yeah another cornwood W!!!!! Ks off the streets
[12:20:02] AntisleepWAN: what if there was a maximum time you can be sent up at one time, 1 day seems long enough except for maybe hut charges
[12:20:02] The805King: yeah ppl should look at it more like that like that guy in jail for 20 days if his job way streaming hed be fucked
[12:20:02] ExHolic: you guys rp for us, how is it fair to put someone for 3 days, nad he could rp his way out but you guys just keep pushing !!
[12:20:02] GunWrath: i think people get too invested in this shit honestly
[12:20:03] TheNachoManRandyCabbage: i mean...they chose to be crims
[12:20:03] bb_woo: So why was he kidnapping cornwood?ü§î
[12:20:04] Brick_Brown: i get that it effects someones stream to be thrown in jail for 3 days but to be fair he did the crimes knowing the risk
[12:20:04] Leafyerick: @EsfandTV K should've had you clock off at Sandy PD but I guess because you left Bay's car outside he thought there were other cops working out of that office
[12:20:04] sircrumpler: meow
[12:20:04] izzy8501: @esfandtv You're gonna make Cornwood lose weight with all that runnin. esfandTV
[12:20:06] LarconReaper: BabyRage BabyRage BabyRage
[12:20:06] TXCVulture: catKISS
[12:20:07] jokerm21: I don‚Äôt think you can bullet point this statement
[12:20:07] Crosstak: @blazerox 3Head
[12:20:07] RietArtwork: This will give him RP, he will be fine
[12:20:08] Undead_Frankie: his point was that he would get less time if he just killed people LULW
[12:20:09] themostnuancedchatter: My favorite arc was when you were suspended just messing around the city learning as much as you can. Being locked in prison not much you can do in rp
[12:20:10] 0restes_: @AShadowOfDarkness there was no scuff and the cops showed up either way bro
[12:20:10] neptunesstorms: K would be fine but if it had happened to a different streamer it woulda sucked
[12:20:11] nLK420: affecting your stream is poor logic. you can play other games, play other characters, rp in prison.. unfortunately many people decide to never make a second character
[12:20:12] JasonMunday: it's like they ruined WoW or something
[12:20:12] Jammer724: idk the fact that kidnaping is worse then attempted killing is kinda weird no?
[12:20:12] Toastedgamer03: @AShadowOfDarkness no, not signing out in an abandoned pd isn't scuff
[12:20:13] cenamyen: The hot gun would have run out before he got on tomrrow. That really wasn't the issue. Kebun wanted to keep the gun so that RP can happen from getting caught.
[12:20:14] CapoOnLive: didn‚Äôt even work with him because of the scuff is wild
[12:20:14] kegelblitzzz: He never wanted to rob, he just wanted to kidnap cornwood but you can't do that
[12:20:15] GodSpeed_R: @jungle_ben cop server?
[12:20:15] afghanpsycho: I should honestly stop egging chat on, too many people take this too seriously  LUL
[12:20:15] tacowookieee: @jungle_ben server is owned by 2 of the biggest crimes in no pixel bubs
[12:20:16] TimmayHS: I'm just worried that Slacks is going to try to use that judge thing to swing all the blame back to you @EsfandTV
[12:20:17] sabinstha1: will k still ber in prison when he wakwe up tomorrow?
[12:20:17] stevens116: honestly esfand love what you do and love how you always take a situation and try to learn and improve on it to make it better for everyone. you are a good dude
[12:20:20] DismalShark: has this been the longest sentence given to anyone?
[12:20:20] Lyssafofissa: @bb_woo Cornwood killed a dolphin :(
[12:20:20] Xclka_: @TXCVulture yeah some theyre not gonna be able to give him anywhere close to 3 days worth of content
[12:20:21] Starscream1379: Was it ever mentioned in all this that he was trying to get you off duty, which would back that he was trying to kidnap you, not rob you?
[12:20:21] SwankXander: HOLY essaying
[12:20:22] the_real_jfk: Damn, that weather is crazy
[12:20:22] dustodagreat: cornwood being the victim then making it look like u were stacking/pursuing a extra 1440 min of jail is WILD
[12:20:23] Sweet_BabyJeebus: @esfandtv this can be precedent to lower that for the future
[12:20:25] cyb3rpan1c: Times like that should not be imposed until there is at least a DOC in place. although that time 4 a CONTENT rp server is still crazy.
[12:20:25] JustJoshinYa2: @fozenoh K was doing an elaborate RP scenario for Tessa. Got caught by scuff. Still rped it out and negotiated and then got fucked in the end anyways. You guys don‚Äôt understand Lord Kebun dude is an RP machine he‚Äôs not just a pos crim like you guys think
[12:20:26] soosmaz74: @bb_woo a dolphin
[12:20:29] BigCumulonimbus: Get that evidence situated and move on. What‚Äôs happened happened
[12:20:31] rattler_2828: he was literally trying to create rp with tessa/cornwood and caught a 3 day
[12:20:32] dontgetitdetsiwt: can you take chat off the screen it ruins the immersion
[12:20:33] ZeeMacNA: @nLK420 lol his stream is baised of rp on nopixel
[12:20:34] Zinzio: Content server. Good rp gets you banned. Pd escorts for solo grinders
[12:20:36] xxrawdy: game on bwoah get that strap ready gonna be a gun fight
[12:20:39] s1cKNation: get few  other in jail  so he dont feel alone 5Head
[12:20:41] BiggE005: If you cant do the time then dont do the crime
[12:20:41] Jungle_Ben: @tacowookieee yeah?
[12:20:41] preznm: how long is 3 days in-game time?
[12:20:42] CreepeAir: i dont think ooc consequences should affect rp decisions tho. if i get suspended from my job i get 0 dollars
[12:20:42] oddfeller: @GunWrath its just like any other tv show except this one is off the cuff, yes people get invested, a lot.
[12:20:43] SultanNT: Chatter : too invested esfandTV
[12:20:43] ColtoCola: TRUE
[12:20:43] potsuie: @soosmaz74 for tessa would have been some good content
[12:20:44] DeeWee222: He is made about the time not about the money or going to jail honestly. but the reason he was trying to kidnap kornwood had like 4 days of planning and a whole RP story behind. Thats what really made him upest about everything.
[12:20:45] blahder: It's funny cause ooc none of the streamers wanted Mr k to be in jail for 3 days or to get charged with possession
[12:20:45] GenWoIf: @0restes_ Without being able to sign out, there was no possible way to escape and play out the RP. The tracker is a magical item that cant be removed.
[12:20:45] splooshtasticals: This is gonna be the best PD ever. U guys will set the standard & help build future bridges.
[12:20:45] iMarks: Ill be honest its a little odd worrying about things effecting peoples livelyhood when people were so adamant of getting ruth fired and i understand she had arl stuff but i think shes in the same boat but isnt viewed as such esfandtv
[12:20:46] albakrut: Denzel's situation is just tough... Mr. K's situation these laws don't make sense compared to each other, so you awakened the dragon which DONT GIVE A FCK
[12:20:46] sammelweis: Cornwood has a HUGE target on his back now lol

[12:20:55] ShadowedSeraphim: @esfandtv slacks still thinks you were saying you wanted to push the possession charge
[12:20:55] HeyMeghan: it wouldn‚Äôt have looked that way if slacks didn‚Äôt skip steps tho
[12:20:55] mfam_lp: in a real case a victim would never be in contact with the criminal
[12:20:56] zuperman270: @jungle_ben Mr k does extreme shit for rp that nobody else will do
[12:20:59] deafguy87: WideHardo SHEESH
[12:20:59] Crimson__Badger: If you are taking the stream into account then there needs to be a max time put on jail time. like a 4 hour limit or something to not hurt the streamer. because at the end of the day you need their crime in the ecosystem to keep things interesting for everyone
[12:21:00] FaahQ2: so sad youre the only cop to watch in the server. all the other cops are mods for eachother and bitter kids
[12:21:02] DarthVasquez: LUL
[12:21:03] CapoOnLive: It‚Äôs literally what the server is lmao
[12:21:04] papafrank97: so u would rather have cg stealing guns every time they use one they carry it cause it great rp for all sides k made 2 new guns
[12:21:04] Mic_Stargazer: lol Cau isn't a solo g rinder, the dude is a getaway deriver
[12:21:04] Viske: LUL chatter
[12:21:05] Toastedgamer03: @JustJoshinYa2 thing is there was no scuff because the PD K went to was boarded up and abandoned, of course you can't sign out there

[12:21:16] austonmatthews34___: grinder RP is trash ngl
[12:21:16] esuardi: good RP? OMEGALUL
[12:21:16] Capacchino: True
[12:21:17] claptil: The sad issue about this is that Cornwood's reputation is probably shot bad
[12:21:18] mikkelite: to be fair it was from 7 different cases
[12:21:18] antreids: lack of critical thinking chatter
[12:21:19] Dontthinkson: Crim RP is the Only RP 3Heading
[12:21:19] GlitchyGunZ: that‚Äôs some first time chatter dialogue lol ignore that @esfandtv
[12:21:20] ilmarcusil: @bb_woo reason was Tessa called Mr k to disarm and grab cornwood and teach cornwood a lesson for killing a dolphin LULE all spiraling to a 3day jail sajj
[12:21:20] zimbabwejoee: üñ§üñ§
[12:21:21] wavy__________________: PD protects G6 Grinders tho
[12:21:21] randybobndyphone: THE WORST PART WAS NAMING THE JUDGE YOU TLAKED TO
[12:21:21] RomanNumera: From K's perspective, it did look like Cornwood wanted to stack charges. We know you weren't but it absolutely looked like it to him.
[12:21:22] LilMoistMeat: Joel Joel Joel Joel Joel Joel Joel
[12:21:22] heinousanus95: Robbing an officer and ocean dumping his personal vehicle is "trying to create rp" now. Thats so funny
[12:21:22] szble: NOWAY
[12:21:23] krustymcdoogle: rp ruined
[12:21:23] sammelweis: it was bad RP all around
[12:21:23] the_main_burt: if prison time just ticked down while people wasnt logged into the server it would be good but at the same time, you can actually make money in jail by getting lockpicks from the job which is good money
[12:21:23] jdotno: the outcome of this is going to be negative all around. either cops are just not going to be included in crims rp plans or they are just going to plan for cops to be a speed bump and shoot them to get out of the way.
[12:21:24] jinnytolls: Chain robbing people is great rp
[12:21:26] facelessXfactor: Folks forget CG is a Brand their characters are their brand its what they built it on. So creating new characters affects there ofg brand
[12:21:26] kennypowersyall: WideHardo HYPERCLAP

[12:21:31] Freshizzle: do some silent hill rp
[12:21:31] tacowookieee: @jungle_ben yes lol server exist on their backs homie. may not like it but it‚Äôs the truth.
[12:21:31] DECD: wheres the RP in 3 days
[12:21:32] LeBryantJordan: this is why esfand is the based
[12:21:32] Phage_Cleaver: RP is kndof like dancing
[12:21:32] vROJIROv: brother what
[12:21:33] OrizonCPE: why have a pd if there's gonna be drama everytime a crim gets caught it's so cringe
[12:21:34] ChrisX3M: i think what you did was fine but it was too late and should have maybe just let it play out and push for it next time because coming from ks stream it really did look bad when you tried correcting the initial charges
[12:21:35] Naffles1: 3day jail isnt good rp
[12:21:35] MadderHatter: K was actually trying to do a really cool rp arc that got spoiled cause of the system and shit on the server, would have been fun to see where it was going
[12:21:35] smiley123abc: have you seen grinders? Thats not RP. A lot of them dont even talk half the time
[12:21:36] Hipsys: everyone is playing their own RP too, you cant possibly follow their script or plan
[12:21:37] blahder: TELL SLACKS THAT YOU LOVE HIM
[12:21:37] TrojanCorpse: the Tessa stuff would‚Äôve been fore
[12:21:37] Sweet_BabyJeebus: I don't think anyone had fun there lol
[12:21:37] rattler_2828: MRk was trying to create u rp
[12:21:38] twoheadedtartar: 3 day soft ban = good rp
[12:21:38] dluo15: no one watches grinder rp. its a content server grinder rp is not content
[12:21:39] Kalious78: @esfandtv I like your streams n love cornwood but he's spiralling too much, should of left it when slacks started the charges and just said after, you spent hours going on about it causing confusion and  lowing it up
[12:21:40] killas09: leave game and play HELLDIVERS @EsfandTV
[12:21:40] deafguy87: but esfand its only a cops and crims server and i want you to win cmonnn
[12:21:40] xkingdelta: You want bad rp someone show the clip k had with some purple hair girl didn't talk at all lol
[12:21:41] noah_a_104: holy its foggy
[12:21:42] Fozenoh: Mr K literally robs hours of civs time LUL 3 days is fine
[12:21:42] calcifero7: saying the judges name was bad
[12:21:42] papafrank97: so u would rather have cg stealing guns every time they use one they carry it cause it great rp for all sides k made 2 new guns  he could ditch and use the new one
[12:21:43] Serial_Chaos: but to be fair prison RP isn‚Äôt good. don‚Äôt know a fix
[12:21:43] Alpz_TV: server doesnt support that
[12:21:44] badstategames: this server kills alot of RP though you cant deny that if you watch the smaller streamers its like watching someone work a full time job haha

[12:21:48] JasonMunday: Looking
[12:21:48] TayG0: Crims already act like they don't care about the repercussions of their actions. This is one of the few times I've seen someone get a punishment that may actually impact their character.
[12:21:51] Finnomenon: just got back from work and ready to watch my favorite streamer im sure everything is fine and good :)
[12:21:52] deafguy87: OMEGALAUGHING

[12:21:53] Exotic_Soul: YEP
[12:21:53] magnets_: half of the robberies he's committed are chain robberies with no rp and little talking so idk what grinder haters are saying @EsfandTV
[12:21:53] PrettyKrazy: un stoppable killing and robbing sprees are the only crime rp allowed xdd
[12:21:53] cyb3rpan1c: 3 days with no DOC is not rp....tbf

[12:21:58] chillaxinvibes: Benji Ramos spent 42 RL days in prison & made RP out of it, Mr. K is a good enough streamer to make RP out of 3 days in prison.

Kebun can because he has a high view count but look at the guy that was in jail for 20 days. there was no one for him. sure k can get content for the next couple days, the issue is jail has literally no content, other players at prison to keep it interesting

[12:22:08] geo_logic_: it was your fault that lovesick quit according to some LMFAO
[12:22:09] CyanOperator: @EsfandTV The whole using Dna from a gun in the middle of a running river is pretty wild. Especially since there are no in game mechanics for a crim to avoid Dna like gloves. The water is legit the only RPable way of getting rid of it. By the logic chosen it just means that even if a crim "washes" their hands for gsr or something cops can just still use the game mechanic.
[12:22:09] PeepoOfdaPizza: jail RP can be good but is all user side yes there is no mechanics involved, no contraband or things to do, etc? @EsfandTV
[12:22:09] nlwatcher: i fucking love cornwood. Ill fight them irl
[12:22:10] kravenbush: Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa

[12:22:11] HeyItsChe: Most grinders don't even communicate though. They sit in the car and grind. If they rp'd as a worker bantering and complaing about their job would be good rp.

[12:22:15] BeerRun204: I'd take my turbo off and lock all valuables away for a few days
[12:22:15] GenWoIf: @FauxReal__ Tessa wanted to punish him for the dolphin at the wedding. It was planned out for like 4 days.
[12:22:16] Rivath: People still try saying he murdered Donald Bush
[12:22:16] Tsithik: my hangup is the incomplete mechanics.  DNA is a shitshow with no way to remove it or prevent it.  it taking so long for there to be shit to do in jail is horrendous

[12:22:23] Hipsys: but, cornwood isnt even a real person, why get mad ooc
[12:22:23] h8t0r: Slacks, in essence, screwed over Cornwood: by trying to negotiate before letting Cornwood enumerate the charges.
[12:22:23] Moregorilla: I heard cornwood faked the moon landing
[12:22:23] HeyMeghan: also ngl kinda bullshit Duncan got part of that commission to pay off his debt to someone but now cornwood has to buy new equipment and got $0 from that @esfandtv

[12:22:44] Andrew0: water doesn't wash away dna lol
[12:22:44] AshyLoL: i mean he wearing gloves tho?
[12:22:44] thegungus: @esfandtv My suggestion, half all charge fines, implement a "bail" price that buys you out of prison which is double the cost of your charges. The bail will decrease as time spent in jail decreases. Easy.
[12:22:45] 3ezzzz: @Dm_ChO there is no way you just said mr k dosent rp LUL
[12:22:45] ArdentCause: hell yes brother
[12:22:45] eduopai: @dluo15 lmao
[12:22:45] ZeeMacNA: i feel having dna with no way to wipe is a little one sided
[12:22:47] Greyconnor: Skin oils AND the fact that you saw him grab it?
[12:22:48] TXCVulture: game mechanics are not to be argued with
[12:22:48] rattler_2828: why is there no way to erase dna but yet dna is so strong
[12:22:48] badstategames: DNA is Bullshit with their being no way for the criminals to get around it
[12:22:49] zmarska: Gloves?
[12:22:51] manamajeeff: "it floated away" OMEGALAUGHING
[12:22:51] GenWoIf: DNA without a single way to NOT leave DNA is stupid.

[12:22:53] piley1132: Whats he going to stream in prison?
[12:22:53] GodSpeed_R: @tayg0 if he shot him. He would be out of jail already. Not an argument
[12:22:53] P0TES: oh i peed on it officer i guess the dna is gone
[12:22:54] RomanNumera: I'm honestly not sure you'd be able to get a sample after it's soaked, though.
[12:22:54] neighborhoodcapricorn: @D00kieSh0es That was based off the chosen rp of that player. He boxed himself into being there for 21 days
[12:22:55] woundedpoptart: fish ate the dna bro
[12:22:55] D00kieSh0es: DNA is tooo powerful since theres nothing to combat it
[12:22:56] DBerryfin: @EsfandTV For sentences that are huge. Do you think police should physically take the person to prison instead of them teleporting there? Would give chances for gangs to attempt to stop the convoy
[12:22:56] sammelweis: that is the RP lol
[12:22:56] Connortation: "you cant shoot me in RP cause wind would make the bullet not go straight"
[12:22:56] Hipsys: bleach = no dna
[12:22:56] Mic_Stargazer: things dipped in water can have fingerprints for a long af time, DNA even m ore
[12:22:57] Hevs: NoPixel is not in a good state at all right now, it feels like an unfinished rushed alpha test for an incomplete server where they are constantly testing slow burn rp with maximum consequences for conflict rp @esfandtv

[12:23:03] cain_dsc: how....there is no counter
[12:23:03] bluguss: I think they just need a way to remove dna
[12:23:04] polercap: I watch a mega ton of people a lot of the problems boil down to city law and a few mechanics that are a little weird
[12:23:04] ColtoCola: There should be a counter to DNA for crims though
[12:23:04] Rivath: If Devs wanted water to wash dna they'd have made it that way
[12:23:05] PikeyAU: game mechanics dont work thought OMEGALUL
[12:23:05] ImVertt: DNA is insanely powerful

[12:23:07] Exotic_Soul: u didnt even need the DNA, u saw him pick it up
[12:23:07] Dontthinkson: Cmon. All Crims know you cant be tracked by "punching out" at a closed police department.
[12:23:08] Ragestrike: still talking about the same thing
[12:23:08] Saucy_Toe: but it‚Äôs a broken game mechanic with no consistency lol

[12:23:10] Brick_Brown: 100% agree the water washing dna thing is complete bullshit that aint how dna works

[12:23:12] djhyzel78: gloves would count for no dna but they don‚Äôt work around that
[12:23:13] gateloz: if the devs add gloves then dna isn't shown it works if not then ur fuk'd
[12:23:13] SlideBarPub: using dna period is weird
[12:23:13] austonmatthews34___: gloves should work tho

[12:23:15] datguud1: just get rid of dna. lol
[12:23:16] cyb3rpan1c: rp it as water washes away fingerprints
[12:23:16] KooterNoodle: why does the DNA scanner work 100% on CG?
[12:23:16] KevinnTCG: DNA is not powerful, it is a balancer, they could not prove anything without DNA, crims would get away with almost all major crimes.
[12:23:17] k_stimz: game mechanic wise DNA shouldnt be a thing unless theres some way to counter it
[12:23:17] facelessXfactor: Water does equal no dna game mechanism need to be built around logic as well dna is over powered
[12:23:17] Dm_ChO: all he does is chase pd and complain about the game
[12:23:18] pdizzleflex: they just send pd these softballs
[12:23:18] Tsithik: i get that im just like why do people have to even argue a made up thing for an incomplete mechanic.  Just take it out till its done

[12:23:20] krimsin360: @EsfandTV why does it seem like the server treats crim RP as a problem to be solved?
[12:23:21] GenWoIf: DNA has zero counterplay. Can't wear gloves, can't remove the DNA
[12:23:21] LegitBanana_: chat 90% of the time it doesnt work

[12:23:28] GLSMarbles: DNA? Objecting, weird
[12:23:28] TayG0: Crims will abuse every bit of RP scuff, but then get mad if cops do anything even remotely similar.
[12:23:28] ZeeMacNA: but in real life u can wipe dna
[12:23:29] Leafyerick: For real, if K had to pay for every crimes he's committed, most of which have been against other players he'd be screwed. Ultimately shouldn't feel bad about it
[12:23:30] oofinside: if dna is bullshit, then wtf is mask if you are wearing the same outfit everyday ICANT
[12:23:30] warner05: If you're a PD, you can get dapped 10 times and have your stream struggle. As a Crim, you can commit a Crime and have your Stream Struggle. Its both sides of the coin. @esfandtv
[12:23:30] FaahQ2: once K knows duncan did it hahaha, no one better snitch\

[12:23:36] xxtrupaul6x: they just need to add a counter to it
[12:23:36] SmugPls: the alternative is dont use hte hot gun, or dont get caught, having there be 0 DNA means almost no way to investigate things half the time
[12:23:37] MrLebowski_: BatChest bro my streamer lost cmon bro
[12:23:37] OdinTW: shrujj he even admitted to possessing it, not on purpose

[12:23:38] cyb3rpan1c: not bood or dna....it was FINGERPRINTS

[12:23:50] sendemup: K literally admitted to "picking up" the gun FailFish that alone is enough for possession
[12:23:50] themostnuancedchatter: DNA is just a weird mechanic right now since there is no counter for crims as of now
[12:23:50] Vesuvius______: cop pov @EsfandTV
[12:23:50] Perne78: they need to just tell you to throw it away or put it in glove box and not touch it

[13:11:29] warhawk384: yep yep
[13:11:30] splooshtasticals: They got so bold with it 4 some reason. Once the EMS showed it was donezo
[13:11:32] slodisgood: The irony that if everyone had listened to you and opened up the two offices to process at, Mr. K's plan would've worked @EsfandTV
[13:11:33] Froggopop: Dont try to RP a great story line... you'll get soft banned.

[13:11:41] bb_woo: Yea taking the cops car a bad idea üí°
[13:11:42] Mr_1Bitcoin: after the 1700 time was mentioned maybe pushing the extra charge was already to late but oh well live and learn jjust rp
[13:11:42] dapyman: Mr. K being a "shot caller" from prison could be amazing RP
[13:11:43] Xeno_phile: we love K and ramee esfenL
[13:11:44] axelfrOst2o0o: played stupid games won stupid prizes
[13:11:44] michael24d3: trackers should only be on cars, the it is IRL (I know RP is not IRL lmao)
[13:11:45] pianoirl: You're amazing and u did everything you can
[13:11:46] kushagra_0306: yes spending 2 days in jail is bs
[13:11:46] warner05: Mastermind K busted by EMS in the bushes Classic
[13:11:47] 1manpizza: never gonna escape the pd while in a pd car xdd
[13:11:48] Im_Creativ: it was some scuff shit but the crims always take the short end of the law
[13:11:48] cyb3rpan1c: SAFER NOT TO RP :)
[13:11:52] pacific_kool3r: i think they thought it was treated properly their characters just have to fight it
[13:11:54] nick_cola86: ehhh, K has been lootboxing the server for a month +, the repurcussions have to come at some point
[13:11:55] bigdanthegoodsir: what if you didnt like them
[13:11:55] Bill_Collector: They were definitely emboldened to the point of being a reckless and got bit
[13:11:56] draacx: hit him up occ and youll see he has no bad blood he is very good at keeping things in the city
[13:11:57] dahacker026nl: The scuff on the server is insane
[13:11:57] GlitchyGunZ: you‚Äôre the absolute last person to be at fault. it was out of your control what others did man @esfandtv
[13:11:58] Sweet_BabyJeebus: maybe just cocky? but PD is new and improved
[13:11:58] adshotta: k and ramee been caught to scuff 0.4 Classic
[13:11:59] Triist0ne: @Froggopop thats a very odd way of looking at it
[13:12:00] KaycasTV: GATEKEEPS NEW OUTFIT AND SLACKS meandyou CORNWOOD FANFIC angy
[13:12:00] timedoggg: ic k not going to fucks with cornwood anymore
[13:12:02] Xanathan420: the time is crazy bad, imagine streaming for a living on a rp server that you enjoy and being told you cant play now for 3 days lol
[13:12:03] CuIdra: @esfandtv can you give us the run of events of how everything went down? From the crash to everything
[13:12:03] kilimajanro: When no one is wrong, nothing gets resolved, best to sleep it off and restart
[13:12:04] allyparser: @Froggopop glazing lord kebun by repeating his words is crazy
[13:12:06] Ragestrike: you should log onto a shitload character now, to destress lol
[13:12:07] keemotherapi: Rping around game mechanics is somewhat rough tbf it limits what you can do.
[13:12:14] johnnytruel0ve: Trackers need to be removable like armor phone etc.
[13:12:15] churrobacca: Either way coming up with charges in front of suspect was the reason for the drama
[13:12:16] sixsaxers: honest question w/o knowing the answer: does /dutyoff exist?
[13:12:19] Luthercorpz: ivibamHeart ivibamHeart ivibamHeart ivibamHeart ivibamHeart
[13:12:21] Blizzard5050: @warner05 and considering the source of everything is even funnier >.<
[13:12:23] NyxUnchained: @esfandtv do you think their should be a mechanic to disable trackers ?
[13:12:29] gekurt: ur kitchen is getting messed up KEKW
[13:12:33] GILx87: Flop > meandyou < duncan
[13:12:36] Im_Creativ: that sucks
[13:12:36] Daddy__Winston: the trackers need to be able to be removed.
[13:12:38] VilleESS: Thanks for the streams! I'm here for the drama Kappa
[13:12:41] BradXeno: I wish the tracker was on the radio or watch instead of tied 100% to duty
[13:12:42] jollypnda: game mechanics are a bit of a double edge sword
[13:12:46] Khaosshinobi: they want kidnapping cops to be harder
[13:12:47] warner05: @blizzard5050 Exactly lol
[13:12:47] harune___________________: dutyoff works at the sheriff office
[13:12:48] Daddy__Winston: without driving to a pd
[13:12:49] chopsuey84: for the love of God stop running laps around PD
[13:12:49] Ragestrike: they got rid of it so kidnaping cops required you to bring to someplace
[13:12:51] Triist0ne: GPS Jammers mhm
[13:12:52] ZachareeeJD: @nick_cola86 you are so dumb. he was not loot boxing. has many RP reasons to what he was doing.
[13:12:53] Khaosshinobi: they had these discussions A LOT in the past
[13:12:53] oofinside: arnoldHalt its the Dev fault
[13:12:53] BlueBird05: dutyoff i think has been disabled for years at this point
[13:12:54] Greyconnor: The thing about trackers is that the car would have one. The car he took
[13:12:55] oofinside: xdd
[13:12:58] bb_woo: He was out his boat he drove by seen you an went for it no plans at all so not like Mr küëçüòé
[13:12:58] sixsaxers: ok thanks @esfandtv !!
[13:12:59] WarrenPuffit: what about that lawyer with the pd gun that flop was working on? obvious plant job, but what happened today would means she needs to be charged and fight it in court for the sake of consistency in the Pd right?
[13:13:00] FaahQ2: chases with him have been 100% so far, why wouldnt he think his getaway chances are high
[13:13:00] Luthercorpz: You were right man. They way you lay out charges etc  It was the play an it does help the whole server ivibamHeart
[13:13:01] Zarniwooper: Crims need duty off robbing mechanic
[13:13:03] Mr_Jhin4: prob they forgot it , dma dev for it KEKW
[13:13:05] Froggopop: @allyparser mb for stating facts.
[13:13:06] CuIdra: So did this all start with the buffalo hit?
[13:13:07] Diamondman121314: I noticed during the heat of the moment, some people were mad at you for not doing "/dutyoff" but it makes sense now
[13:13:08] bigdanthegoodsir: then gotta stay on duty
[13:13:10] itzcookiebtw: ya it‚Äôll be this repetitive annoying cycle
[13:13:10] Narva95: right they could rp KEKW
[13:13:11] d36i: @EsfandTV just asking but if you like hard alt f4'd would you still be on duty when you come back in?
[13:13:13] Grallus: Turner told you it was removed to stop the rp from tonight from taking place.
[13:13:14] draacx: can always ooc that you are signed off, but then it would be weird
[13:13:15] adshotta: maybe they can add an item for that but its expensive
[13:13:15] OhMahGlee: 3 days jails annoying
[13:13:15] nick_cola86: @ZachareeeJD tessa was mad he stole a dolphin... that's your RP reason lol
[13:13:15] timedoggg: they don't want people kdinapping cops at all cause its 3 days and -150
[13:13:16] RagRanger: playing a cop is like never leaving the safe zone in a game
[13:13:18] Daddy__Winston: then you ban the ones doing it to be annoying.
[13:13:21] grimmjoww66: yea, there has to be punishments for stuff like that, otherwise the server would actually be a complete shitshow
[13:13:21] atrigent: maybe they disabled dutyoff for exactly this reason? LUL
[13:13:22] awildpog: kidnapped cops is almost always good RP as long as it's not low effort SBS
[13:13:23] bigdanthegoodsir: shoot em if they make you sign out
[13:13:24] quentos01: You should have a "max jail time" system, where nomatter how many charges you add, you can't go above say 6 hours or something
[13:13:24] squonk513: you signing out would be a bigger red flag than anything
[13:13:25] Im_Creativ: but having mechanics against it is also very powerful
[13:13:27] Protomateria: tbh i still dont understand why he kidnapped you in the first place LULW
[13:13:28] cyb3rpan1c: LBH, ppl. not kidnapping cops anymore. Safer to ignore pd rp #civ life
[13:13:31] papafrank97: gotta stay on duty 24
[13:13:32] squonk513: you're always in
[13:13:38] allyparser: @Froggopop ur just being weird
[13:13:38] Ragestrike: i miss samuel el jackson.
[13:13:40] Im_Creativ: youre getting banned
[13:13:41] xxdownbadxx: is Cornell upset this could ruin the relationship with Mr K ???
[13:13:42] JasonMunday: very WeirdChamp
[13:13:42] leetz23: I think the PD watch would be a cool way to add/remove tracker/compass
[13:13:42] VenatusVox: Do you ever go to bed thinking RP of that day and then about what your path will be for tomorrow lol
[13:13:43] Bill_Collector: That's fail rp
[13:13:44] GlitchyGunZ: Cornwood a natural leader  feeling responsible even when he shouldn‚Äôt. respect ü´° @esfandtv
[13:13:44] d36i: yeah understandable ofc
[13:13:44] Raja_Banhammer: that wuld have been even weirder
[13:13:44] warhawk384: i mean to be fair IRL cops have a silent panic button on their radio for scenarios like that...
[13:13:45] MrActivated: Thats fail rp
[13:13:47] Daddy__Winston: not the ones who had something setup for 5 days
[13:13:48] krimsin360: @awildpog This is 100% the issue.  Lazy crims create giant punishments for good crims.
[13:13:51] SeaThePirateCat: pulls up to a police station with a cop hostage Tomfoolery
[13:13:51] Im_Creativ: lule
[13:13:55] Im_Creativ: LULE

[13:14:03] Luthercorpz: KEKW
[13:14:04] Khaosshinobi: pretty sure back in 2.0 or 3.0 if cops lost their radio they lost their tracker as well, and they ultimately decided that cop kidnapping should be hard, cops should have a terrifying presence
[13:14:04] pacific_kool3r: IM SORRY ABOUT THAT GUY

[13:14:04] JasonMunday: OMEGALUL

[13:14:07] SirGO0SE: people are smoking crack
[13:14:07] TXCVulture: OMEGALAUGHING
[13:14:09] lowvr6tj: @esfandtv - with how ‚Äúletter of the law‚Äù was applied as black and white for Mr. K, 3 days jail time and the fines ensued, would it not be fair to say that by ‚Äúletter of the law‚Äù, the woman who had the gun planted on her should have the charges applied to her and let her RP it out in court
[13:14:10] Bill_Collector: It's harder not impossible holy
[13:14:10] Xanathan420: @quentos01 yea, imagine getting suspeneded from your job kinda from rp'ing in a video game lol 3 days way too much
[13:14:10] cyb3rpan1c: IS IT?
[13:14:10] BlunderedHope: NOOO kidnapping cops is dangerous??

[13:14:23] ZachareeeJD: @nick_cola86 so I can see you do not eat cg k at all or follow his story. so keep watching your cop streamers.
[13:14:24] Pakkasparkers: try kidnap a cop in real life and see how that turns out when they are armed...
[13:14:24] Bill_Collector: How many cops did k kidnap and throw off a bridge last week
[13:14:24] sixsaxers: lol
[13:14:25] Asolo_1: soo nomater what the police do the crims cant fight back
[13:14:25] StreamElements: Post top tier content to my subreddit https://reddit.com/r/esfandtv
[13:14:26] draacx: High risk, for not really a high rewards item wise but the rp of it is amazing
[13:14:26] wutupdun: any reason you didnt RP /signout?
[13:14:26] Priceybuticey9: @esfandtv How long after Gta 6 comes out do you think No Pixel and Cornwood will be able to make an appearance in Miami PagMan
[13:14:26] Grallus: Snr buns is too dangerous, so I should stop eating altogether
[13:14:27] ixidakonixi: if you kidknap a cop you better have a plan and backup incase it goes bad
[13:14:28] Raja_Banhammer: the only type of rp for some people is just all out deathmatch LULE
[13:14:28] nekodon1: how about not kidnapping the face of PD with a ton of witnesses
[13:14:28] CuIdra: At the end of the day, they are playing cops and robbers and you need both for the pretendy time
[13:14:29] Damaged0ne: I still think that either way you should be able to confirm you were off duty.... in frwr for your life ya? Ps I watch  you and cg and ssaab quite a bit
[13:14:29] d36i: the charges are wack that is true, he wasnt wrong that its less punishing to just shoot them lol
[13:14:30] zac4e: "My crim streamer got caught Smadge "
[13:14:30] Zelmian: JUST kill cops 4Head
[13:14:32] NyxUnchained: as the spokesperson for chat hoppers that guy does not represent us KEKW
[13:14:32] cyb3rpan1c: think of the 3 hours of rp he gave...got dbl time? safe???
[13:14:33] adshotta: gta is cops and robbers crims and cops
[13:14:35] barnzbee: the charges are avoiding RP. why try to RP when you can just kill cops instead
[13:14:36] atrigent: that sort of shit was getting spammed nonstop in kebuns chat
[13:14:36] TXCVulture: ReallyMad i should be able to do what i want with no repercussions

[13:14:39] Luthercorpz: Plays MMO wants to walk through in God Mode  eeehh LUL
[13:14:39] Alpz_TV: bro crim rp with police is pointless in that area if you get soft banned for it
[13:14:39] PsychoJoker: Cant kidnap them screw it why RP with them 4Head
[13:14:39] Tantaloc: @wutupdun he just said they disabled it
[13:14:39] Exorius: crim brain. cop is only there to be NPC that will be abducted
[13:14:39] DrWetbone: k made you put things in glovebox, he human trafficked you
[13:14:40] RavenHackberry: Can't kidnap a cop? Better not sign in FeelsBadMan
[13:14:40] TokSykMorty: robbing cops seems like it will end once crims can reliably get the same equipment maybe? (vests, plates, etc)
[13:14:43] s5ashadow01: "can't kidnap cops = NEVER RP with them" - chatter who has no idea what's going on
[13:14:44] aaronalford24: I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs stupid depends on perspective
[13:14:45] MrLebowski_: ReallyMad this is fucking bullshit
[13:14:47] itzcookiebtw: @khaosshinobi indeed.  you shouldn‚Äôt be able to just drive up and kidnap a cop and no big deal you can get away.
[13:14:48] Bill_Collector: Slacks just flubbed it
[13:14:49] BukiGame: is the goal of the laws to make the server a euro truck simulator?
[13:14:51] churrobacca: should have told K to close his ears while going through his charges
[13:14:53] pbay359: We chatters are something of a scholar ourselves
[13:14:53] d36i: you lay out charges by the letter of the law, you press charges by the spirit
[13:14:53] draacx: daggum shitshow
[13:14:55] Wynter282: crims get mad when they get caught lets just stop rping with crims
[13:14:56] Deadroca: the thing is the cops didn't make an effor like for example where cornwood last seen and they search for him they just found him with a plep
[13:14:56] adshotta: its on slacks mainly u did right
[13:14:56] squonk513: too many people trying to prove a point rather than RP

[13:14:59] Priceybuticey9: @esfandtv How long after Gta 6 comes out do you think No Pixel and Cornwood will be able to make an appearance in Miami? PagMan
[13:14:59] Ismellkevinbacn: So you're trying to be a lawyer not a cop
[13:15:00] Zarniwooper: Cornwood goes around HOURS with nobody calling welfare checks, ems ruined this this time
[13:15:01] wutupdun: ah thanks didnt catch that
[13:15:01] BlunderedHope: it was indeed a dadgum shitshow
[13:15:02] Soee1337: @EsfandTV the thing is - it doesnt make much sense that killing a cop will result in less of a consequence than robbing a cop. How is it possible to roleplay around that law?
[13:15:02] johnnytruel0ve: K was willing to RP to tell it all but the charge stacking and side convos turned him off of it. Cooperating
[13:15:03] 1800protossmemes: I think you're just dealing with the same people with cop rp cause you don't get much up north
[13:15:03] Mr_1Bitcoin: the 1700 was already mentioned and then you came in was the issue I think as mentioned
[13:15:06] Bill_Collector: Slacks is a white belt in yapping and he needs to be a black belt as captain
[13:15:09] ChaoticSanity: The underlying mistake in all of this was having this discussion in front of Mr K @EsfandTV
[13:15:09] k3z123: would be better to have a physical tracker like crims had in 3.0, would help with rp and signing out issue
[13:15:11] ShowGunNoGun: Mr.K let his ego get the better of him at the end
[13:15:13] zimbabwejoee: üñ§üñ§
[13:15:14] ElizabethAtDawn: it just got convoluted that‚Äôs all
[13:15:15] Ruttiger64: him interrupting every 5 seconds doesn't help
[13:15:16] slomojosh: @aaronalford24 nah bro that entire sequence of events was stupid and rushed
[13:15:17] JC9R_: it was too big of situation and you didnt have everything lined up prior thats all
[13:15:19] Im_Creativ: in that situation would you be able to let your fellow officers know to give them a little leeway @EsfandTV
[13:15:20] Nkbat: No shot you're still talking about this
[13:15:20] neinchooch: Mr K did all the crime when the punishments are public. My god the whining. MY WHEEE^STREAMER
[13:15:20] kilimajanro: Bad timing to fi it after stating lesser charges tho, on the receiving end it comes off much worse than yours
[13:15:21] claptil: M

[13:15:26] HostageDK: @ShowGunNoGun you're dumb
[13:15:27] jollypnda: the only real issues i see, is if people start trying to push those large time and fines on a regular basis what happens is, cops start getting ambushed during banks and traffic stops
[13:15:27] bb_woo: They do need to cap jail days a few hours is a lot days is just crazy overkill for rp üòé
[13:15:27] Soee1337: @EsfandTV the thing is - it doesnt make much sense that killing a cop will result in less of a consequence than robbing a cop. How is it possible to roleplay around that law? Û†ÄÄ
[13:15:27] droksid00: Chat can you whisper me the real reason K wanted to kidnap Cornwood
[13:15:28] quentos01: @Xanathan420 Yeah it's too much and ruins the fun and in the end both cops and crims feel bad
[13:15:29] krimsin360: the situation was stupid, not the RP, the RP you all had was great, you were just forced into a shit spot because of the environment in the game
[13:15:30] jb_brotha: Mr. K got 3 days of FF7 Rebirth
[13:15:31] oofinside: penis
[13:15:31] splooshtasticals: It turned to mind games & refusing to cooperate. Didn't wanna listen.
[13:15:32] adlaytv: @Ismellkevinbacn depends? are we trying to be chatters or players
[13:15:32] Ronspike: does getting found with a pd gun get you charged with robbing it?  if no, why?
[13:15:36] ElizabethAtDawn: Essaying
[13:15:36] oofinside: mhm
[13:15:36] Protomateria: Chatting holy
[13:15:37] FaahQ2: he doesnt believe that, feel cornwood as a character would go explain himself to him while in prison
[13:15:38] DaltonCL: cops have to have a good understanding of the law irl chat dentt
[13:15:40] Daddy__Winston: no you was adding charges infront of the suspect after reducing others. the process was flawed not the charges
[13:15:42] Priceybuticey9: PagBounce Gta6Wood
[13:15:44] Chaoszero_goc: this is 80% Miz's fault
[13:15:48] yeetleyop: catJAM catJAM catJAM catJAM catJAM catJAM catJAM catJAM catJAM catJAM
[13:15:49] Nojsty: @jb_brotha imagine rping a different character
[13:15:50] everyone1980: at the end of the day Mr K could of had 2 whole days and 120k in fines taken off and he choose not to go down that road.
[13:15:50] ZICOforYURI: no interaction with police officers allowed
[13:15:54] KooterNoodle: go visit Mr K in prison tomorrow
[13:15:54] Soee1337: mhm
[13:15:57] fishnchips333: all drama aside...fuuuck would it have been good if you got kidnapped. you would have unlocked some good funny meta man @EsfandTV
[13:15:58] Pakkasparkers: mr K just needs to learn when to accept an olive branch when its being extended
[13:15:58] draacx: especially now that stuff is trackable
[13:15:59] d36i: i was surprised you didnt get a dap for mentioning the judges name that woulda been warranted imo
[13:16:00] ShowGunNoGun: @HostageDK And you're emotional about RP
[13:16:00] stevens116: watch one of these days soon he will come onto stream with a c collar on for his neck
[13:16:02] kain_loc: I'm not sure how, but all of this is Bobby Charles' fault.
[13:16:02] Ismellkevinbacn: It's a question bro chill
[13:16:04] Kira_FR: Howdy y'all
[13:16:06] slomojosh: they had to combat lootboxing cops tho
[13:16:07] Triist0ne: the charges that they made is a bunch of bandaid fixes
[13:16:10] BukiGame: @EsfandTV i mean 3 days in jail is a soft ban and then 100k takes forever
[13:16:10] Leafyerick: @EsfandTV If the cop permas isn't the fine and time insanely high though?
[13:16:10] ogwookie: harambe was an inside job
[13:16:11] madhatterui: lets just blame Bay for crashing the car Kappa
[13:16:12] oshohii: alot of cops are gonna probably die these next few days
[13:16:13] HostageDK: @ShowGunNoGun how hypocritical lol
[13:16:13] AddyAdam: its so funny that adoption fraud is 60k lol
[13:16:13] sixsaxers: @pakkasparkers no
[13:16:13] xkingdelta: Yea true
[13:16:13] Rivath: Wasn't K the one kidnapping all the cops originally that got the charges increased?
[13:16:14] BurningFlag: That charge was change in RP?
[13:16:15] miller511: charges and their adjustments are a reactive process
[13:16:15] thereal_lechuck: as victim cornwood should olny made his statement and out
[13:16:18] Bill_Collector: You should have stepped outside of the room to handle all of that for sure
[13:16:18] aaronalford24: @slomojosh oh I agree that situation was I mean how people feel about certain mechanics and such.
[13:16:19] Rastafiki: well i think its so high to decentivize doing it. cuz then police are walking loot boxes with no demerits.
[13:16:19] squonk513: Mr.K is the Judicial systems checks and balances
[13:16:19] Destroses5100: killing a LEO is a HUT charge though? so its worse than the kidnapping one right?
[13:16:20] RomanNumera: In K's perspective it looked so bad, though.
[13:16:21] 1manpizza: Prayge Bobby and Carmine get control tomorrow
[13:16:21] dvbb: He also refused lawyer assistance, which might have helped make that part of the process not go the way that it did. The lawyer presence does help encourage a certain way of doing things
[13:16:24] Daddy__Winston: yes the process was bad. what you was trying to do was correct
[13:16:25] MrLebowski_: Jason Polam will pay for this.
[13:16:25] Mr_1Bitcoin: @everyone1980 They wanted a gang leader to say why he had a dirty gun with 7 bodies on it lol...
[13:16:25] sciencemouse1: I love how the hot gun didnt even matter at the end of the day
[13:16:25] fatdon40: K might be hard head but I agree with k's take
[13:16:27] johnnytruel0ve: But you still proceeded to stack knowing it's too much it's hypocritical
[13:16:27] Damaged0ne: They did the same thing charge wise with moseley right? Up it because it was reoccurring
[13:16:27] ixidakonixi: k was done talking the moment he heard the 1440 min charge
[13:16:29] atrigent: that just creates more rp for k tho, he can go to max to complain about it etc
[13:16:31] BlueBird05: For me, the RP of kidnapping officers I've seen so many times, I don't care for it. It also ties up the PD from other calls and I think the PD should not be walked over so easily, it should be difficult to do so, IMO.
[13:16:34] draacx: Blame the black buffalo damn crimal hitting yall caused all of this
[13:16:34] teknowledgy404: @BukiGame nah he already stole enough PD turbos this week to pay most of that lmfao
[13:16:34] xkingdelta: What time is your podcast
[13:16:35] titanvol29: Especially now that crims can make guns they don't have to rob cops for guns
[13:16:35] Tigriopus: Is there somewhere we can read no pixel laws?
[13:16:36] Bill_Collector: @johnnytruel0ve it wasn't stacking
[13:16:37] squonk513: noice
[13:16:39] Xclka_: @Destroses5100 thats if the cop permas
[13:16:39] DeathBlueR0se: So why did Slacks jump the gun?
[13:16:41] watsondubbox: @Rivath they made that change weeks before he did that arc
[13:16:44] k3z123: yeah 1400 mins for it ruins interaction with pd
[13:16:44] Iron_Bjorn: @EsfandTV is it rude of me to say a lot of issues have arisen because slacks cant seem to wrap his head around what your saying?
[13:16:45] Luthercorpz: City Council would have to vote again to lower charges. The City Hall RP matters too. Just like the ppl that were robbed, shot etc.
[13:16:48] oofinside: xdd check who's on duty
[13:16:50] Bill_Collector: Yup
[13:16:51] decentenuff: For me, * something no one cares about *
[13:16:51] taraannee: time in prison for doing the most serious crimes = "ban" got it chatters Kappa Kappa Kappa
[13:16:53] squonk513: @DeathBlueR0se he dont care anymore lol
[13:16:54] bigdanthegoodsir: prison RP is more the Mr K deserves
[13:16:54] Nero_21: Honestly hell week isn't even bad you just get shot and spend like 5 mins in the hospital ,but you can jail people for 3-4 days so its pretty worth
[13:16:54] splooshtasticals: spilled the beans too soon. Agreed
[13:16:55] churrobacca: yup
[13:16:56] Bill_Collector: That's what fucked it all up
[13:16:59] KooterNoodle: that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre pressing the charge on that legal aid you defended so the wording can be changed
[13:16:59] Xeno_phile: yea it was just a mistake at start to not have the charges fully fleshed out before presenting to him
[13:16:59] GlitchyGunZ: yeah you did the right thing it was good slacks validated you after at least @esfandtv
[13:16:59] Ronspike: does getting found with a pd gun get you charged with robbing it? if no, why?
[13:17:01] Im_Bennn: how is the charge too much when just last week 7 cops got robbed for guns LULW
[13:17:03] Mattwolf325: you are getting way to grabby with chat. just enhoy yourself and have a gerat time brother ;) do what you feel is right
[13:17:03] HashTagIDontKnow: lessons learned
[13:17:03] zenubaka: gave mr. K blue balls
[13:17:04] Chaoszero_goc: I dont think he was going to talk, he was still going to get mad, he was still going to kill cops
[13:17:04] JasonMunday: be interesting to hear Max's take on these fines compared to other ones
[13:17:05] CuIdra: I wish they added community service for a crime (not this one of course) like picking up trash on the side of the road
[13:17:11] awildpog: he got a terrible deal to be fair
[13:17:12] Rivath: @watsondubbox Are you sure? There wasn't a 100k fine a week ago I'm almost positive
[13:17:13] Xclka_: o7 that judge
[13:17:13] RomanNumera: To K, it looked like you wanted to stack charges hard, it's unfortunate.
[13:17:19] Priceybuticey9: Are you gonna have to RP Cornwoods  moving to Miami for Gta 6 RP later down the line?
[13:17:21] xJOKURv: if you was victum. were you even suppose to be in interrogation
[13:17:21] BiggE005: Slacks was doing everything he could do to minimize the charges being pressed
[13:17:22] Cr4ss: I think everyone throwing their 2 cents in confused Slacks some
[13:17:23] LCK_K: monkaS
[13:17:23] noah_a_104: @EsfandTV you going to the academy tomorrow?  Û†ÄÄ
[13:17:24] slomojosh: if Bay knew how to drive this wouldve never happened to begin with
[13:17:24] salvi9: talking in front of K is what started it all cause when K heard of PD firearm he started chirping
[13:17:25] squonk513: clean pull out
[13:17:25] Greyconnor: Would it be logical for a crim to bring a cop to a police department to sign out? Like would they "Assume" the PD is vacant, but lets you sign out? @EsfandTV
[13:17:26] kaweka308: I feel like a lot of the problems are coming from the lawmakers being far too reactive than pro active.. they need people like you in these discussions to argue both sides so things are more balanced for the sake of RP sake
[13:17:27] Gundaree: it was a clusterfuck
[13:17:28] fishnchips333: @bigdanthegoodsir calm down dude lol such hate lol
[13:17:29] BradXeno: podcast tomorrow should be interesting lol
[13:17:29] papafrank97: don‚Äôt understand k can always get a new gun and use them there would be complaints of not being able to find a lead if he keeps ditching old gun
[13:17:30] droksid00: Too bad moon isn't on. Would love to see Max's thoughts
[13:17:31] RietArtwork: @esfandtv You gotta remember the whole Mr. K thing id making the PD look bad, so he just took advantage of the shitshow
[13:17:31] typical_user: @EsfandTV why do you think they should have just left?. Mr. K mentioned that "robbing a cop" is seen as a bad thing, but it could also bring some good RP if done right.
[13:17:31] yeetleyop: ok chat moving on....
[13:17:32] kratoids: doing all that in front of him and telling him the judges name, it was a total clown show
[13:17:33] Khaosshinobi: @Ronspike robbing and possession are two seperate charges and are designed in a way to make it very bad to get caught and can stack
[13:17:33] Bill_Collector: Why the fuck did k have that gun bro that's just sloppy
[13:17:34] FaahQ2: K's 'final form', Dragon will show up after this stint. gonna be messy from now on no matter
[13:17:35] Zolothan: getting laser focused on that was bad entertainment honestly, which does matter to some of us
[13:17:37] marshmallow12900: also saying the judges name you talked to about the possession charge to Mr.K wasn‚Äôt great to
[13:17:41] draacx: like i said it is what it is Cornwood will get got a few times then itll be over
[13:17:41] DrWetbone: weren‚Äôt you and flop suppose to frolick together
[13:17:44] bigdanthegoodsir: @bigdanthegoodsir Hell im playing I love mr K
[13:17:44] squonk513: like
[13:17:45] Espartemos: A consistent written procedure for processing (like the pd has for everything else) is whats needed @EsfandTV
[13:17:46] Tigriopus: Curious what Chief Beric will have to say
[13:17:46] Triist0ne: shots fired call POGGING
[13:17:49] atrigent: what exactly does qualify as "stacking" anyway?
[13:17:50] cyb3rpan1c: but he did, y can't we admit that?
[13:17:50] 1manpizza: o7 that judge you mentioned
[13:17:51] DieterK: turbos DinkDonk
[13:17:56] kaweka308: I feel like a lot of the problems are coming from the lawmakers being far too reactive than pro active.. they need people like you in these discussions to argue both sides so things are more balanced for the sake of RP

[13:18:01] TrueJRyan: my question is why didnt you hold Slacks's hand before he went to bed? xd
[13:18:02] nosnese476: the situation became bigger than mr.k but it's unreasonable for him to recognize that in the moment
[13:18:02] Priceybuticey9: Are you gonna have to RP Cornwoods  moving to Miami for Gta 6 RP later down the line? @esfandtv
[13:18:03] Protomateria: shit happens man
[13:18:04] Vengy: like why would he use that gun, surely he knew it was hot?
[13:18:04] TheSoldier1851: It was a mistake, but that'll create some RP LUL
[13:18:05] watsondubbox: @Rivath pretty sure yeah, think it was hand in hand with the 100k possession charge
[13:18:05] UncleSolar: Poor Dolphin Sadge
[13:18:06] Bill_Collector: Gatsby o7
[13:18:07] churrobacca: that was the best part
[13:18:07] Brandonhipster: @Bill_Collector Not about the gun!!! He didnt care about hot gun. It was the charges in the end
[13:18:07] BlunderedHope: fatigue sets in dealing with the same situation for 3 hours
[13:18:08] KevinnTCG: o7

[13:18:09] Smell_of_Shoko: K throws everyone off. hes smart and witty.
[13:18:09] BukiGame: @teknowledgy404 i mean he stole 1 i think? and you want him to steal 5? the point is that for police rp to happen you need crime rp to happen. if you wanna rp in eurotruck simulator go ahead
[13:18:09] Mindhysteria: gatsby o7
[13:18:10] KooterNoodle: I mean it‚Äôs crazy that Mr.K could‚Äôve killed 82 cops and got the same charge as ‚Äúrobbing a police officer‚Äù CoolStoryBob
[13:18:10] nappathon: mistake made on all sides

[13:18:11] Shmoopee: esfandLUL
[13:18:11] aaronalford24: Honestly all future rules should be if your a victim in the crime you shouldn‚Äôt be involved during questioning or charges
[13:18:13] Mr_1Bitcoin: To k it looked liked the charges were at 1400 then cornword got them to 2700 and then said he was helping lol
[13:18:13] Xeno_phile: mistakes happen all g
[13:18:13] Ronspike: @Khaosshinobi but was it not robbed at some point to get it?
[13:18:14] papafrank97: judge name shouldn‚Äôt have been said LUL

[13:24:30] adshotta: o7
[13:24:30] titanvol29: Healthy conversations not shitting on someone if you think their opinion is different
[13:24:31] kreljos: bunch of them hopping around they don't represent any one streamer's community, they probably banned there too
[13:24:31] huukahstank: whats ur defence?

[13:24:51] western_villain: as a streamer you don't know if your chatters are 10 years old or 40,
[13:24:52] VenatusVox: @EsfandTV more stake out on the mexican plaza like last night?
[13:24:52] ActuallySupremacy: Shift 3 aka degen shirt LULE
[13:24:53] CookiesOP: situation sucked sucks, but it aint that deep
[13:24:53] AzureMbee: lol people get way too invested in the RP
[13:24:54] adlaytv: as a lurker, i didnt watch any esfand before rp and just wanna say as a "crim" viewer i have really enjoyed you
[13:24:57] CuIdra: People have always been like this,  the Internet just brings them together in clumps.
[13:24:59] steryroids: damn did they buff the car? lol shits cruising
[13:25:00] BauR: @esfandtv will you be swapping out the turbo in the scout to a less expensive one since your cars has a big target on it ?

[13:25:08] Bulletproof_santa: @EsfandTV I just find it funny because no one complains when crims rob grinders who grind for mats just to get rob in 2mins lol
[13:25:10] oofinside: Pause turbo
[13:25:10] Leafyerick: @EsfandTV Also did you mean to leave the taurus at Sandy?
[13:25:10] o_PL_o: How could anyone say anything bad about you? you sweet lovable man
[13:25:13] eklu65: @aeropunkx huh

[13:25:16] JasonMunday: TURBO Pause
[13:25:16] Seetherrr: @fishnchips333 ssabs' chat can be absolutely vile which is crazy for how nice a guy ssab is
[13:25:17] Daddy__Winston: @pax_rush its garbage.
[13:25:20] Mr_1Bitcoin: Iv been watching Rp for many years and it happens anytime anyone with a big following has an unfavorable outcome =/
[13:25:20] GlitchyGunZ: always going to be miserable people. taking out their anger on people undeservedly @esfandtv
[13:25:21] ChaoticSanity: I enjoy your dynamic with chat. It's nice to feel like you're heard every once in a while. Some people just make us look bad when "Twitch Chat" is used as a generalization and usually in a negative context.
[13:25:23] kahlilgo: k is a pro he‚Äôs got his chat in check, rlly impressive considering how rp is
[13:25:23] Shmoopee: Pog a positive message
[13:25:27] bb_woo: Good rp like a good movie peeps get emotional lol üòÜ
[13:25:28] TheTyBear: Parasocial mixed with RP is a crazy cocktail.
[13:25:31] Soldeadguy: @EsfandTV Because Mr. K was just pardoned last night do you think Moonmoons character will get some heat for it?
[13:25:32] huukahstank: i cant
[13:25:35] PuNchiNg: honestly the fact this type of stuff gets viewers so invested is a blessing and a curse KEKW
[13:25:36] itzcookiebtw: @smell_of_shoko we love chatters like you. we had someone else come in earlier. it‚Äôs nice seeing the good people of the community and not always the bad ‚Äúhoppers‚Äù
[13:25:37] SantaJerrys: Jebaited
[13:25:38] ActuallySupremacy: moseleys monkaW
[13:25:39] hawkeye69r: People treating RP like it's real is literally the thing that makes RP good
[13:25:39] Eeyley: will play ff7 when the rp slows down Copeless will play ff7 when he does variety Copeless will play ff7 when it comes to pc Copeless i swear hell play ff7 Copeless
[13:25:39] sciencemouse1: @Seetherrr Yea His chat is tough to even look at
[13:25:42] coachmeup5: fact is I wouldn‚Äôt have found Chang gang without summit and without Mr k I wouldn‚Äôt have found your stream. You all are good streamers
[13:25:42] anywiders: its sad that when stuff like this happens its some of the most toxic stuff ive seen on twitch
[13:25:43] fishnchips333: @Seetherrr agreed
[13:25:46] cyb3rpan1c: ppl. need to understand ppl. don't just watch cop simulators OR just crims. watch rp too see stories unfold from all rpers
[13:25:47] pax_rush: @Daddy__Winston maybe, but if he's playing it regardless it'd be better on pc no?
[13:25:47] RomanNumera: I'm a crim viewer who enjoys esfand as well. Primarily Lang/Yuno/Ramee
[13:25:47] CuIdra: I literally forget Cornwood is his last name until someone says Mr Cornwood.
[13:25:47] noah_a_104: you left the taurus o7 @EsfandTV
[13:25:49] McIvn: think it was a good call to make sure k gets all the correct charges but man it killed great rp
[13:25:49] jordeon123: OMEGALUL 100%
[13:25:52] blahder: Yep
[13:25:52] 1manpizza: Evilge 100%
[13:25:53] grimmjoww66: definitely
[13:25:55] Protomateria: he should tbh
[13:25:56] kreljos: haha imagine trying to shittalk in moonmoon's chat LUL
[13:25:57] KooterNoodle: damn, the not being able to sign off duty really cucked some good content that was about to happen
[13:25:59] draacx: its def gonna look bad
[13:25:59] chiefboof024: lmao ofc
[13:25:59] superbizarr0: NODDERS i think it will be great RP
[13:26:02] cmnylHD: @esfandtv Those people are clearly wrong and I hope you know on a human level how immature and thoughtless those people are. They‚Äôre toxic and wouldn‚Äôt say it to your face. People think they know the streamer behind a character behind a screen. We don‚Äôt know you, but what we know of you we appreciate and love. I‚Äôm you to get stupid essaying remarks for this message but feck you need to read it. you‚Äôre loved and appreciated and you‚Äôre human so look after YOU ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è

[13:26:13] Eeyley: Chatting
[13:26:14] chillaxinvibes: @adlaytv same for me.  always watched crims - but really enjoy watching Cornwood RP.  Appreciate the wholesomeness of it :D
[13:26:14] atrigent: @kahlilgo his chat is a complete cesspool tf you mean LUL
[13:26:14] Daddy__Winston: @pax_rush more fps will always be better, but the game is so much different
[13:26:16] anywiders: essaying
[13:26:17] Xanathan420: pardoned? wouldnt all of the older charges been dropped at that point?
[13:26:17] FaahQ2: pardon is a pardon, holds no issues
[13:26:18] cmnylHD: Knew it
[13:26:18] Runtrains: hoooly essaying
[13:26:19] bennnnboy49: @kahlilgo bruh were u reading his chat at all during the interrogation? that was the opposite of in check

[13:26:37] more_parrots: @Xanathan420 they dont just poof
[13:26:39] cmnylHD: Yes.  A message with more than two words = essaying lmao
