[1:15:30] QuesoCommander: everything has to be seized at some point because it can't go into the prison, just the question of whether the search continues inside the pages
[1:16:02] JoeayIV: its tough
[1:16:13] retrowolf0498: I'd view it as a 1st amendment violation.
[1:16:17] JoeayIV: like you don't document every phone you seize
[1:16:19] nobodybodon: I'm sure theres been IRL case laws on this
[1:16:23] jimothy64: If they had a good faith belief it might contain evidence of the crime being investigated, they're probably good to check it I reckon... its not like private data like text messages so...
[1:16:24] JoeayIV: but like
[1:16:25] QuesoCommander: IRL I assume it's fair game because it can also contain illegal goods
[1:16:27] vipersummer: i dont feel like the entire story was given
[1:16:33] Lavitzboss: yea exactly
[1:16:37] krstee: expectation of privacy?
[1:16:40] HiImSkiva: i mean irl if a cop finds your diary they will read it lmao, everything thats on you becomes evidence
[1:16:41] Grobyc117: It's definitely fair game IRL
[1:16:53] paper_puppet: how can it be proven that someone else didnt write in it or an officer didnt write in it to falsify evidence
[1:17:04] Lavitzboss: I think they could "shake" the book to make sure there are no weapons in it, but I don't think they have the right to read it
[1:17:08] dinoroaria: NOTED
[1:17:18] ciphz: no it doesnt, only of the notebook is sealed with a lock
[1:17:21] nobodybodon: @paper_puppet thats an affirmative defense, not on the cops to prove they didn't fake evidence
[1:17:29] jimothy64: Big difference between a phone and a journal in the eyes of most jurisdictions' laws
[1:17:43] Lavitzboss: I would assume they would have to have PC that the book was somehow involved with the crime being investiagated
[1:17:54] ApocAFK: You know
[1:18:01] ApocAFK: Probably half the city
[1:18:01] nobodybodon: pepeLaugh she doesn't know

[1:18:27] thephil2020: That may be something that needs to go to court.
[1:18:30] Moobs_: it was so funny to watch that earlier, I couldn‚Äôt believe who it was
[1:18:50] Moobs_: someone who def should have known better
[1:18:52] jimothy64: Like, some cops used to search photo albums in 3.0, and never caught heat for it so.. probably very similar
[1:19:01] Winston_Moriarty: maybe in a conspiracy/money laundering/drug distribution case could be justified.
[1:19:50] GoofyPsyko: Maybe to keep things ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù however that mean like keeping a book.
[1:19:59] ApocAFK: I feel like, IRL it is all legal, but maybe in RP it might be changed a little Hmmm
[1:20:01] GoofyPsyko: the bookie keeps tabs on everything that happens?
[1:20:03] jimothy64: If the journal isn't secured its probably fine. Hell if you leave your phone unlocked and open, some jurisdictions allow for it to be searched
[1:20:15] doctorawesomus: i feel like it would be a prosecutor‚Äôs case to lose
[1:20:27] HiImSkiva: it depends if the person is under an investigation or not, in a traffic stop the cop can‚Äôt read it but if you have a warranty out for murder they should be able to access anything you have right
[1:20:27] Rhizwynd: maybe they can search depending on the charges being pushed? or it needs a warrant from a judge?
[1:20:29] nobodybodon: Google is no help here, can't find an answer to the question
[1:20:40] darthdin: so it be ok if it said drug sales?

[1:21:03] nobodybodon: I feel like you wouldn't need a warrant for a book though. thats not really personal data in the way a phone is Hmmm
[1:21:18] QuesoCommander: i'd imagine the server would need a ruling on it, cause IRL you could stash money in the pages, but do they want to allow that search if it's not a risk mechanically?
[1:21:43] darthdin: james randal?
[1:21:59] itsstarkyyy: James Rodriguez
[1:22:08] retrowolf0498: How long until he gets robbed.
[1:22:13] Madd_King: you should have to be present at time of drawing
[1:22:51] cdscarn: (imo) Only if the journal is seen to be written in during the crime can you read it, or it visably open and could be read by anyone; is it ok to read the jounal

[1:25:04] AshesFade: hello El Tesso moon2S
[1:25:10] JoeayIV: i think for documentation its fine, i think everyone's phones are assume to be "locked"
[1:25:20] JoeayIV: its the locked status that keeps them from being looked at
[1:25:57] ApocAFK: suffering
[1:25:57] jimothy64: The journal is free game in UK law irl, if you're able to be searched they can search anything on you. Locked phones are something of a weird exception.
[1:25:57] retrowolf0498: See if it's the same person next week.

[2:13:15] nobodybodon: that circumstance is the same as the incriminating tweet one, its circumstantial and they'd need more than that to convict you regardless.
[2:13:27] jimothy64: That'd be like constructive possession. If you're in charge of it, it's one you.
[2:13:34] mgFray: bidet? sprinkler? his choice
[2:13:40] cdscarn: Moist squats
[2:13:50] jimothy64: But it's not enough to push a charge alone imo
[2:14:35] cdscarn: I agree with that
[2:14:45] jimothy64: If you search a house in a raid, you read the notes and stuff there... so why wouldn't you read notes in a person search
[2:14:53] nobodybodon: I think she's saying you'd need the same PC as a subpoena, but you wouldn't ACTUALLY need a subpoena
[2:15:25] mgFray: "Treat it like you would a phone, if you need a warrant for the phone -- then you probably need one for a journal... BUT the journal itself isn't 'locked', so this is probably untested in the SA court...."
[2:15:56] dickylucky: NAUR
[2:16:15] ChaosKnight0777: is tessa planning on staying legal?
[2:16:34] jimothy64: A phone subpoena gives you permission to get data locked away. A journal isn't secure, there's no expectation that it is, so it isn't afforded the same protections imo
[2:16:39] dickylucky: @ChaosKnight0777 El tesso is illegal but tessa always
[2:18:01] dickylucky: OH NO TESSO RUN
[2:18:01] Fwuedwikk: DonoWall
[2:18:06] nobodybodon: yeah I think its REASONABLE to say that any PC to search someones person is PC to look at a journal, at least IRL, since it does have less of an expectation of privacy. its almost sort of kind of plain sight?
[2:18:18] ChaosKnight0777: lawyer tessa or judge tessa would be fun if she wanted to help people that way

[4:16:16] jimothy64: I mean... is it? Its no worse than youtube videos on knowing your rights and what to do in custody.. remove any personal names and rename the book and its fine
[4:16:18] Rekonin: It basically puts anyone in, or working with, the italians under the microscope
[4:16:18] leydann: I kinda wish she never showed you it, just imagining a cop picking it up and turning to "Tessas Tips".
[4:16:19] VELAFER: she could make it a best seller

[5:41:29] thegrandgeneral3: I think rolling with an established crew helps clear up the "shes a cop" mentality, like seeing her hang with CG or the Family more often will help
