[0:33:26] L7TRIP: true
[0:33:28] stellarnaut: Denzel gonna be vice city PD ??
[0:33:29] pathasahat: I hope they let NP work with them instead of having to crack it like all the past gta games
[0:33:31] TateJ_: i thought they were inncorporating RP in the game itself
[0:33:34] Lucid_Jaydee: Ohhh shit, Rockstar bought FiveM?
[0:33:34] MDM4ever1986HD: PC release later than console

[0:33:39] officialChicoB: They bought FiveM so they really utilize it for GTA 6
[0:33:39] BKBiggy: also more control over RP
[0:33:41] ramsin50: it doesn’t matter minimum 3 years
[0:33:43] antzinoooo: Rockstar owns 5M?
[0:33:43] FetchLong: Rockstar RP will be a SHITSHOW tho
[0:33:44] solid1244: who bought 5m?
[0:33:45] steve_more: Cuz they wanna do their own server and make it a paid for service
[0:33:47] BDG_parth28: Bro they ain't even releasing PC version yet
[0:33:53] ramsin50: it will be in 2027
[0:33:54] ForgottenXShadow: Rockstar did buy 5m
[0:33:56] FilzG: PARANOIA
[0:33:57] MDM4ever1986HD: @WildWillie419 if they hate it why did they buy fivem?
[0:34:00] Nadeflow: Feel like they bought fiveM cause copyright issues
[0:34:01] GamingAudioBook: bro  lowkey im just excited for the crew at the sherifs if it happens
[0:34:02] BKBiggy: hopefully more stable online services for the RP
[0:34:05] chmbrs: ofc, thats why they bought it and told everyone to remove the copyrighted stuff. theyre gonna do something HUGE with it in GTA6
[0:34:06] DanLGG: I think they gonna collab with Nopixel and make a crazy RP server. it makes sense for them to collab with the best in the business
[0:34:06] officialChicoB: The Rp will carry GTA6 to different levels

[0:34:09] Athasin: @mikewhocheesehairyyyy12 They said 2025 for consoles, no word on anything else but hopefully 2026 for PC and then modding
[0:34:16] CTRSWebb: probably 2035
[0:34:19] chmbrs: they even told tpain he couldnt play RP cause it will interfere with something
[0:34:24] WildWillie419: fiveM isn’t noPixel
[0:34:25] FilzG: Denzel hearing guns already, the ptsd
[0:34:32] stellarnaut: @steve_more I'm not gonna lie I really don't want take two to control GTA RP

[0:36:10] anuphev: SCHIZO I HEARD IT
[0:36:19] stellarnaut: @feraldog7 that's what I'm afraid of, the funnest part of these games are sometimes the passionate mods the community makes
[0:36:41] pawneefour: Running with gun out? seems dappable

[0:37:10] BDG_parth28: !backseat
[0:37:10] Fossabot: Please allow Dean to play the game how he wants. Refrain from helping him and suggesting things unless he asks for the help. If you continue you will be timed out and it will turn into a ban.
[0:37:11] pawneefour: how many people are on the server rn?
[0:37:15] BDG_parth28: !meta
[0:37:15] Fossabot: Don't tell Dean information about other characters that he does not know in game. He cannot do things if it is said in chat and he sees it. Sit back and just enjoy the rp.

[1:20:53] AsuniRS: i dont understand why the adoption/marriage laws are a thing
[1:21:02] Janman88: the reasoning for the adoption law would be intereseting

[4:04:11] DisConfused: @karaskyee I can see your point, BUT they like to cheap out on cpu cooling, MB, and offbrand ram, so just an idea to keep in mind
[4:04:14] d_o_g_o_: @bobdang07hd of course it will change. as soon as they can build them with barely any human input prices will drop
[4:04:20] j0k3rhub: @jeeb408 id reckon a 1060ti would do
[4:04:21] getanime: He pronounced it well
[4:04:29] Bigeyez: The good thing about prebuults are the warranty and we'll not having to do it yourself

[4:06:57] EmDuBB13: isnt ramee too only is that jus a corn thing
[4:07:12] d_o_g_o_: @bobdang07hd until theres a minimal labour cost and a machines doing it then the companies can buy the parts cheaper than you can causing the prices to be lower than you building it. Atm you are only paying more for it to be built at some point it will be done for them
[4:07:22] Fossabot: If your enjoying the stream smash the DAMN follow button! I mean shit its just a click away... Might see your name on screen ;)

[4:08:11] ThePointGaming: Open EBta

[4:08:22] Hunchok3n: 16
[4:08:25] sliwoski_: Progress carries over tho

[4:08:27] Baamsta: 16
[4:08:29] TheeMikeSmith: beta but progression carries over
[4:08:29] rhaziaa: It came out 10 years ago.  It was called Assassin's Creed: Black Flag.
[4:08:34] Randog__: the 16 I think
[4:08:36] Hunchok3n: 13 if you get the premium
[4:08:37] serioushustle: @moe1124 skull and bones
[4:08:39] gateloz: tekken 8 looks kinda crazy
[4:08:45] Bigeyez: @d_o_g_o_ you'll always need labor to build PCs because there are way too many variances with different parts and products. There is never going to be "machines" that just put together a whole PC.
[4:08:46] Jay_B06: sup dean sup chatt
[4:08:48] moe1124: @serioushustle ohh ok
[4:08:49] Baamsta: ive liked it so far
[4:08:52] itreffle: yea
[4:08:56] Bigeyez: At least not in the current market

[4:09:08] FLCK3R: de rolo Susge Susge Susge
[4:09:12] Emeralblade: @rhaziaa best pirate game ever made. No idea why they called it Assassins Creed though lol
[4:09:14] CrustyWill: deanVibe
[4:09:15] xsilas43: @d_o_g_o_, youre still entrusting the quality of labor to someone who is at working on it vs someone who is passionate about it. oil change shops will always use the lowest quality oil available for example. They also may not care if every bolt is tigheneted down manually to spec.
[4:09:15] bobdang07hd: @bigeyez good luck I blocked him I can’t lol
[4:09:23] itreffle: @Enoobrac because its better?
[4:09:25] moe1124: damn

[4:09:47] moe1124: he almost the same age as dean

[4:12:43] Lord__Gen: @d_o_g_o_ This is just wrong. The prebuilt companies make their money off up charging the prices of parts. This is easy to check, just find a part list from star forge and put that into pcpartpicker. Parts are about 20% cheaper if you purchase yourself and look for deals, and you don't pay for labor.

[4:58:51] mutantzombie01: @deansocool you should try to ease your way to swat by doing a shooting lesson after the first couple of PD shootouts and say you want to teach them how to deal with shootouts, then later down the line, you should ask to do specific training for people to lead shootouts and breaches. then you would eventually write a request for a swat unit to deal with the situations
[4:58:51] KawNilsen: @helemok not very cold where u are then lol

[5:20:50] Nsan7: lookUp PissTime:R

[5:20:55] jayrodk: Is swat like copy righted? Because for all the years I’ve watched nopixel the are like no we don’t call it swat? Like they have a swat division but they’ll call it Hvtu. Does anyone know?
[5:21:06] ramsin50: dean how do i get you to react to a 2 min youtube vid?
[5:21:07] marneraiders: SWAT really limits your Area of operations. Like you can’t Stake out people as SWAT. If you get yourselves a different name like: “SAD” Special Activity division, it broadens your field of operation.

[5:21:18] Xellwrath: no lol

[5:29:44] buddha_hands: "means proven to be capable of manufacturing illegal weapons" so.. the parts used to assemble

[5:31:13] j0k3rhub: @moe1124 i remember what happened last time
[5:31:17] buddha_hands: having all the parts (arguably) could be articulated as having the means by which to produce them, but that'd be a court thing
[5:31:24] SurvivorPlayz999: @magnets_ do you know who it was?
[5:31:27] sonadapop: hell nah i dont trust moe with shit
