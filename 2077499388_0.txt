[0:52:48] jimothy64: So here's a weird one; I technically broke my ribs the same way I first broke my nose.... several years apart
[0:53:01] brikbeans: @macman385 did they reset it on site
[0:53:08] brikbeans: pog <3
[0:53:46] brikbeans: being emotional unaware helps alot
[0:54:11] macman385: @brikbeans oh sorry meant separation but i still have basically a memory scar of the pain as i still reach for it time to time
[0:54:28] doctorawesomus: D:
[0:54:29] JoeayIV: i mean
[0:54:33] JoeayIV: if it still has it
[0:54:34] SomDeVil_: do peepo come to you and boop your nose?
[0:54:36] JoeayIV: then yea you could break it
[0:54:48] jimothy64: I first broke my nose when I was 9/10. I'd been away for a weekend and my younger brother got excited, ran at me, winded me, ran at me again and headbutted my nose....
[0:54:55] brikbeans: @macman385 wait that sounds worse then dislocation...
[0:55:09] brikbeans: that pig tape trick must go hard for you then
[0:55:38] OxfordFictionary: God, don't we all
[0:55:53] jimothy64: ... my ribs I'd been away for a week, I was 12, that same younger brother got excited and dropped all his weight on my chest while I was laid on the floor.
[0:55:57] Davser75: I'm 48 and have only broken 1 bone ever. My pinky toe. Opponent landed on it after a head duel in a soccer game
[0:56:07] macman385: @brikbeans i landed on my right shoulder wrong on a roll when i was full sprint and extended getting the catch, it was not fun for about the first week especially
[0:56:38] Davser75: Yup was bad. Normally they don't do anything about that one, but they had to, the bone was like < angle
[0:56:43] rednovastorm: I've only ever broken my finger and my collarbone... My finger got caught in a baby gate and my collarbone lost a fight with gravity.
[0:57:17] jimothy64: The year I broke my ribs was CURSED I had three Gym classes all year. I broke my toe in the first one, discovered my ribs in the second one I attended after the toe healed.. and on the way home from the third one I got hit by a truck...
[0:57:22] Davser75: Getting shots between the toes for painkilling is the WORST pain i ever tried
[0:57:32] doctorawesomus: I once had a spinal tap. :)
[0:57:45] QuesoCommander: i once broke my pinky toe by stubbing it, but then like 8 years later got an xray for something else and apparently I had also broken part of my foot and didn't know
[0:57:48] brikbeans: yo these stories are getting more cursed and cursed someones gotta have a gnarly one

[0:59:16] JoeayIV: it was not fun
[0:59:20] jimothy64: Dude that year was so cursed. The truck incident led to a broken wrist and permanent spinal and nerve issues... but adrenaline man, I got up on scene and cycled home...

[3:48:44] funkie: wow.. tessa must really see red
[3:48:46] funkie: SCATTER
[3:48:50] magnets_: feels like cornwood is one of the easier ones to do that too tbh
[3:49:01] KidAJoe: Why are we kidnapping cornwood?
[3:49:02] dinoroaria: D:
[3:49:20] Darth_hedgehog: was it the same situation when trying to get them alone like with mary

[3:51:34] rattencheeseburger: wolf in sheep's clothing sheeeesh >_<
[3:51:36] Rex1101: !mary
[3:51:36] StreamElements: Mary Wolf is Tessa's violent alter ego. Tessa Blacks out when Mary takes control and has no memory of what Mary does. Mary tends to be triggered by the senseless murder of aminals. Recently Mary has come to realize that nearly everyone is guilty in some way and wants to use the PD as a means to enact the justice that she has been craving. Typically, any time Tessa pulls the trigger, it won't be Tessa.
[3:51:47] KidAJoe: El Tessa is a serial killer like dexter style?
[3:52:26] Darth_hedgehog: Nakkida was it the same situation when trying to get them alone like with Mary
[3:52:28] pogaroos: I guess it's lucky Sam Baas died in 3.0, or else El Tesso would've came for him

[3:57:11] nobodybodon: Chat, no backseatsies Madge
[3:57:25] IosefSerov: There is a wacky factor there lol
[3:57:33] QuesoCommander: would have to get him on a locked in day
[3:58:14] distractfulilly: I always wondered. What did the darker side of Tessa think about Joe Goldberg and his whole thing?
[3:58:16] jimothy64: Gotta wear the el tesso mask if she does. There's plenty of people Tessa could go to for this too.. she has a few groups that'd probably be willing and capable

[6:24:10] JoeayIV: what then?
[6:24:20] alphawolfgrave: Does 31 cats sound fun it's not

[6:24:36] JoeayIV: see
[6:24:38] JoeayIV: thats the issue
[6:24:44] JoeayIV: they just fixed my ventilation
[6:24:48] nobodybodon: Just build more vents, like tessa did
[6:24:54] JoeayIV: and now its too hot
[6:24:58] JoeayIV: before it was cold
[6:25:08] retrowolf0498: @JoeayIV That sounds like my bedroom. No matter what it's around 70 degrees in it no matter the weather or windows being open.
[6:25:08] jimothy64: Is the -6 air outside? Or is it AC?
[6:25:16] JoeayIV: i have a big one pointed right at me and a little one below my desk

[6:28:21] Codingale: @ForillChange Mini splits are genuinely the best choice, heating and cooling can be done on them sometimes per-room
[6:28:40] nobodybodon: thats what a window unit do
[6:28:55] josh1832000: was sized too small
[6:29:29] VexedVixon: yeah theyre really only good for small rooms/bedrooms but when theyre working well theyre great imo
[6:29:35] nobodybodon: I mean, they do have a vol that they're supposed to be able to cool, but they don't create ventilation, you can't expect it to cool more than the room its in.
[6:30:04] JoeayIV: but anyways
[6:30:06] JoeayIV: heat pumps?
[6:30:07] JoeayIV: mega cool
