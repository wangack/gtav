[2:15:17] Gifi4: Put a clean shirt on and spilled my coffee on it. Atleast it's black.
[2:15:20] mrm9734: It doesnt let you enter the blat, you need to use the climb button
[2:15:21] Kfestofil: how about, you find a jetski
[2:15:22] VojtechStrnad: you climbed onto that bike
[2:15:23] onlypom_: but pressing f would get you in without using the climb button
[2:15:26] billyboysam: go to the pier and step onto a boat
[2:15:28] OstrichNipple: As long as you dont press the jump/climb button it's okay
[2:15:29] Madicos: is there a boat you can fall off the dock near the apartments nearby
[2:15:32] taneesh2616: you can’t enter the boat by pressing F. u gotta climb it before u can start driving it
[2:15:34] Abdiel_Kavash: if it is just the animation of entering a vehicle, it doesn't count
[2:15:34] BrokeGameDev: How will you dive into the water?

[2:16:07] OstrichNipple: Should have just made it a no spacebar challenge and there would be no confusion
[2:16:09] troubledcatfur5: getting into a vehicle, boat or car, shouldbt count
[2:16:12] mikturnal: sounds reasonable
[2:16:12] cold_play1278: Sonic
[2:16:12] EliteTM23: I mean you can’t do anything if it’s an animation of him climbing

[2:16:42] wood333999: wait for the boat to not spawn
[2:16:46] BrentButler: Is the dive a jump?
[2:16:47] SmileyESL: climbing is also defined by changing ur altitude. So for me it would be getting into a boat, same as getting onto a bicycle
[2:16:47] silverdust11: Did you just jump into the water?
[2:16:49] taneesh2616: but u gotta get the timing right to get the boat to spawn tho

[2:33:22] casskix: Never saw someone pushing a car bevor xd

[2:47:06] leonskennedy12345678: @pinkyshy_ I just realized it couldn't be about trevor 'cause they thought he was dead, i thought it couldn't've been about T, because i thought sick puppy would be a way to describe him somehow

[2:49:37] sleepertbe: @BobTheMartin dont think he can get enough speed
[2:49:42] RyanReynoldsCousinTyrone: are you in the right game version
[2:49:44] pinkyshy_: Even if you get on the roof, how are you planning on climbing up to the AC unit?
[2:49:47] mick_horneta: What about a buffered ledge grab at limited frames so the game throws you away? I once went out of bounds with it
[2:49:51] realnixie: Lester doesnt know what he is talking about, just ignore him Matoo
[2:49:54] Xeedds: can you roll?
[2:49:58] eiivs: hullow si viper!

[2:51:19] ayselow: real!!
[2:51:21] darkj_ev: if you find a bike again you could use the stairs to help you start the wheelie. theres a easie wall to just hit and bump up to the roof. doesnt require much speed either
[2:51:23] massivebegleiterscheinung: MATTO what about the server Farm BUZZARD?? WutFace WutFace @darkviperau
[2:51:26] pinkyshy_: @doubledoublerob he's trying to find a way to the roof without jumping out climbing the ladders

[2:53:01] Patilios: !patch
[2:53:01] Fossabot: @Patilios Patch 1.27 is played on for several reasons. 1. There are no waves. 2. You avoid getting a bug on the mission "Monkey Business." 3. It is easier to leave the mechanic. 4. No FPS stuttering. 5. Save Warping. 6. Hospital Warps 7. Can change camera angle while climbing to clip into walls
[2:53:03] JRD999_: dviperDead

[2:53:20] GameRollGTA: If they have patched this, what other options are there?
[2:53:27] troubledcatfur5: do you have a plan B?
[2:53:27] kuilios: the only thing I can say is to find a bike and bounce off something to get ontop
[2:53:28] doubledoublerob: isn't matt climbing stairs?
[2:53:29] 39glitched: make a stack of cars maybe LOL
[2:53:30] massivebegleiterscheinung: @donnydaadealer its super fun to use while gettin chased from locking missiles and Shooting flairs on them while climb a building with a bmx...they WutFace WutFace LUL LUL
[2:53:39] popcornchicken890: as a last resort you should still try the bike thing

[2:54:14] jackathelegend: THE BIKE! exclamation mark
[2:54:21] Kfestofil: pain, suffering
[2:54:21] PurifiedShino: if just grabbing onto the ladder doesn't count then why not ladder launch?
[2:54:21] LaBlueGrrl: I love that proselytising is a minor sin in my religion, lol. No pushy knobbery allowed: For you is yours, for me is mine C:
[2:54:24] popcornchicken890: Lots of falling. No jumps tho
[2:54:25] QuickSolved: are ladders counted as climbing?
[2:54:26] pinkyshy_: This isn't jumping... It's falling with no style
[2:54:27] ayselow: get police chopper dviperWicked
[2:54:32] seanthescouser: falling is the cousin of jumping

[3:01:49] leonskennedy12345678: @BinaryDragon casing the jewel store
[3:01:49] jayc_hd: @darkviperau remove a door to get on the car it's so much betterrrr
[3:01:49] jackathelegend: Try parking the car halfway
[3:01:59] grindhardt_: for anyone wondering, he is currently trying to set up the jewelry store heist but needs a way to access the roof
[3:01:59] jackathelegend: Try halfway on the pavement
[3:02:00] Fossabot: Check out my YouTube for the best bits of my stream youtube.com/@DarkViperAU dviperComfy
[3:02:04] BobTheMartin: You probably need to be angled towards the car, not away from it
[3:02:07] BinaryDragon: Oh. I see how this mission would prove problematic.
[3:02:10] Kfestofil: place back tires slightly higher? like on a curb?
[3:02:14] PurifiedShino: Can you step up onto that solid bush line the  onto the car?
[3:02:18] WAVOKK: DarkviperFace
[3:02:19] icetube12334: can you get a parachute and just levitate anywhere really high in the air and just use parachute to fly at the top of a building?
[3:02:22] Gifi4: @grindhardt_ I'm telling you, Rockstar put ladders in the game 4Head
[3:02:23] mrm9734: You need to activate two checkpoints on the roof. You cant glitch up there immediately i dlnt think
[3:02:24] BobTheMartin: Like passager side in hole
[3:02:25] cold_play1278: poofesD
[3:02:29] VexedUXR: How high can you go
[3:02:30] BobTheMartin: Is what I meant
[3:02:35] MrHarlz_: could it be because its in a mission checkpoint area? knowing r* it would be somethign dumb like that
[3:02:40] grindhardt_: @Gifi4 quick someone tell matto!
[3:02:42] lucasarentss: Hi
[3:02:46] Kfestofil: try having the car backwards on the stairs?
[3:02:53] primepotatoes: Addddd
[3:02:57] TheGaminNorwegian: There shouldnt be a difference of collision flags there and the other place where it worked
[3:02:59] jackathelegend: @icetube12334 He's trying to do that, just he's having difficulty finding a spot where he can actually levitate and gain air
[3:03:01] Kfestofil: ideas people, ideas
[3:03:02] captain0314: L ads
[3:03:03] Gifi4: @grindhardt_ No no no, could you imagine the wrath!
[3:03:07] donnydaadealer: can you check the collision of the road or somthing to see whats up
[3:03:11] Markarlit: Try angling car in different ways maybe
[3:03:13] BobTheMartin: I meant Lester's side of the car in hole, so Michael isn't sliding off
[3:03:15] marginalship5: just came back, you're still on this mission!?
[3:03:21] neonel47: Put your car on the white line of the road

[3:03:53] BobTheMartin: @DarkViperAU I meant Lester's side of the car in hole, so Michael isn't sliding off, he'd be sliding into the car
[3:03:57] Kfestofil: what the hell just happened
[3:04:02] Gifi4: @Xeedds Honestly Lester would have stopped the Wright brothers from flying
[3:04:06] LaBlueGrrl: Test levitation, please ignore
[3:04:08] hanzie777: Cheer5
[3:04:08] sanyochan: @PushyMcButtons true dviperD

[3:04:20] BinaryDragon: Matto says as though there's any chance of him not going insane regardless.
[3:04:20] DrLangeskov: is it micheals car? Can he open the trunk/doors using the phone?
[3:04:29] mistrz_motyl: Lester beeing like 👀
[3:04:31] Gifi4: What are you, a dinosuar?
[3:04:33] Adak17: try rear wheels on sidewalk and front on road, to make the car angle downwards

[3:04:39] IRPShaolin: was that not climbing?
[3:04:42] marginalship5: u jumped
[3:04:43] OstrichNipple: Sub 1000 hour pace
[3:04:44] MrHarlz_: alright people open GTA, we shall test in this area and suffer with him LUL
[3:04:46] andreizabest: Maybe you can better inspect the geometry of the spot that it works in and see what's distinct about it?
[3:04:50] lucasarentss: dviperDead
[3:04:50] sanyochan: take your time dviperLove
[3:04:57] popcornchicken890: isnt it a darker road?

[3:05:12] PurifiedShino: That solid line of bush? can you step up on to it then onto the car?
[3:05:18] faNduBBLez: the road its just like tonya
[3:05:20] BobTheMartin: I meant Lester's side of the car in hole, so Michael isn't sliding off, he'd be sliding into the car. At the hospital you also put Lester in the gutter
[3:05:22] Patilios: @dutchterminator7 for testing, right now yes
[3:05:22] spaffjd: maybe its the fps
[3:05:22] sanyochan: @mikturnal dviperPats
[3:05:23] PushyMcButtons: @dutchterminator7 just for testing
[3:05:23] Kfestofil: well the only thing i noticed that was different, was the road was going slightly down, are you sure that's not it ???
[3:05:25] killerking1092: the run has passed away
[3:05:26] faNduBBLez: and cletus
[3:05:26] neonel47: go back where it works
[3:05:32] LaBlueGrrl: @mikturnal Share 🥺
[3:05:33] Xeedds: we allowed to climb atm.. testing glitch spots.
[3:05:36] pinkyshy_: It could be something as obscure as a floating point precision error in the character's coordinates at that location *shrug*
[3:05:37] troubledcatfur5: doggo
[3:05:37] puptime: aineMlem domesticGood dviperWave moistGood shadow685Cool
[3:05:37] sorrywhatdidyousay: can you not get high enough from the other spot?
[3:05:37] FluxOxklint: @DarkViperAU Go check if that road that it works on is flat or rounded
[3:05:38] DrLangeskov: @massivebegleiterscheinung damn, ty for the info
[3:05:41] jackathelegend: DOGGO
[3:05:42] jdhdkddj: dviperLurk
[3:05:45] Markarlit: Maybe its about road is angled and how suspention on car works?
[3:05:47] OstrichNipple: Go back to where it work and investigate
[3:05:51] laserframe: the car has to face east
[3:05:53] faNduBBLez: this road is just like cletus and tanya
[3:06:04] massivebegleiterscheinung: @drlangeskov youre welcome Bro <3
[3:06:14] trankill076: dviperHmm
[3:06:15] mrm9734: Just do it with a helicopter. get it before the mission and then bring it with you up to this point
[3:06:18] X6UR: Why not just get a parachute, go to the spot that works and try going up as high until you are able to chute down onto the building
[3:06:19] Adak17: make car face a decline maybe, rear wheels higher than the front
[3:06:20] Gifi4: East is west and west is north, but sometimes south is just south
[3:06:23] mikturnal: @LaBlueGrrl here you go 🍝
[3:06:31] bryan_8710A: dviperDead
[3:06:31] neonel47: Go back where it worked
[3:06:32] donnydaadealer: check the collision on it
[3:06:39] BobTheMartin: @DarkViperAU What I was trying to say is put Lester in the gutter, so Michael isn't sliding off, but sliding into the car

[3:06:49] bryan_8710A: dviperDead dviperDead
[3:06:49] darkj_ev: there was a flying glitch in cs2 and it only worked at certain y x  locations on the map. idk if this would be the same type and only works at certain coordinates
[3:06:50] andreizabest: Maybe something to do with the lane divider? Just a random shot in the dark
[3:06:53] LaBlueGrrl: @mikturnal Shukran, habibi ^^ 💙
[3:06:54] Kfestofil: @DarkViperAU try the road that worked but angle the car differently so you can check if it's the road or car angle
[3:07:00] mistrz_motyl: It started with that stupid pool in prolog 😂
[3:07:03] massivebegleiterscheinung: @mrm9734 thought same with the Server Farm BUZZARD but he has to climb for that dviperDead djmagi3Pickleshake WutFace
[3:07:06] dutchterminator7: just type BUZZOFF
[3:07:09] primepotatoes: Leave the mission get a heli or blimp and daisy chain
[3:07:10] Gifi4: F
[3:07:10] TheGaminNorwegian: Just checked codewalker, collisions are the exact same. So its something else than collision mesh and collision flags doing it

[3:08:17] BobTheMartin: What I was trying to say is put Lester in the gutter, so Michael isn't sliding off, but sliding into the car. That's what happened at the hospital and here too. Right side of car slightly lower did it
[3:08:20] dengostolemybaby: Both times you did it the diver side kf the car was higher than the passenger side. Is that all it needs to work?
[3:08:20] Gifi4: But high enough to parachute

[3:25:20] BobTheMartin: I'm pretty sure it works when lester's side of the car is lower and the door is open, making you slide TOWARDS the car instead of off of it
[3:25:23] ayselow: mikey a lil delulu
[3:25:30] realnixie: If you get it now i will laugh myself to death
[3:25:44] neonulled: do you still have the parachute?

[3:27:10] taneesh2616: Okie

[3:27:12] Von_Doge: this seems like a real struggle watching you fall out of a blimp was cooler

[3:28:08] grindhardt_: so hard to pinpoint what is going on without fully understanding the mechanic
[3:28:09] mrm9734: You might also have to get close to the first checkpoint before being able to land on the ac unit. I dont think you're getting enough height.
[3:28:17] BobTheMartin: In the other spot car was tilte

[3:29:20] manstertaco1: Michael was shaking
[3:29:28] youshallloveeachother: but why does one wheel matter, if you could just levitate on the road in the original glitch location?
[3:29:28] crvstys0ck: AAAUUUUGGGGGGHHHHHH
[3:29:33] corrosivescorpion: Can you launch yourself up the side of a building using a bike?

[3:29:40] PotatoeHX: maybe you can only doing that in the middle of the road ?

[3:30:16] mrm9734: Im fairly postive it won't get yoi enough height. You will have to ragdoll before parachuting
[3:30:24] realnixie: Imagine seeing this from Lesters perspective
[3:30:24] Iv7n: why doesnt matto just get an oppressor mk 2? is he stupid?
[3:30:25] duduutvk: when you did the glitch in there you were eith the door closed
[3:30:26] PushyMcButtons: that's super close to where you had it parked the first time it worked
[3:30:28] deadpool2566: I should sleep but i dont want too
[3:30:29] Richminion: I love how lester must be seeing this asking himself "WTF is michael doing?"
[3:30:30] w0blz: where the road and pavement meet maybe?

[3:38:08] CaptainPuff: Root motion is when you embed your character proxy moving with the root bone of the animation, which is often used for climbing animations, so you dont have to manually move your character proxy there, but instead have it be moved by the animation. You falling there could have messed with a pair of animations, like stumble combined with falling or something... Would explain the necessity of the door, anyway

[3:54:36] LaBlueGrrl: @deadpool2566 This ain't an airport, you don't have to announce your departure

[3:54:49] corey658: How’s the challenge going? anything impossible atm?

[3:55:50] das_oleg: In online ther eis a second one
[3:55:53] shtbox_canyon: levitate by the first check and then you can parachute on top
[3:55:56] Wygser: it seemed like you dont need to touch tthe ground, maybe you can parachute across it and land on the end
[3:56:01] CJDLB7: evening chat! hope everyone’s having an amazing day <3
[3:56:02] EliteTM23: you just being near the roof activated the dialogue so maybe you can land near the end

[3:56:07] Murphimself: is the reserve chute available at this part of the game?
[3:56:07] MrSmooth360: @CSGONobody no, but no one uses ladder to get down in the speedrun so all good
[3:56:09] zoethar: could you levetate and glide across with parachute so you land on top where you take pictures?
[3:56:12] PotatoeHX: maybe try to find closer levitation close to the building ?
[3:56:17] tomo2016tomo: You could probably glide over the first checkpoint and head to the 2nd
[3:56:22] xerxil: Lester immediately telling you to go back to the roof
[3:56:25] k4rakal: You could probably glide over the first checkpoint and head to the 2nd

[3:58:48] hanzie777: u needed the prompt bro
[3:58:48] yusnes: if you levitate close enough to the checkpoint you might activate, so you only need to levitate once
[3:58:49] Shpluj: he's just testing lol
[3:58:50] k4rakal: maybe save the parachute for the last jump since you need to land on the vantage point?
[3:58:51] PushyMcButtons: north end of the building
[3:58:52] Zoinx: tool tip
[3:58:54] jayylves: ladder prompt

[3:59:00] Genesis9628: You need the prompt
[3:59:04] das_oleg: man i just looked away for a minute and he is flying again and i wanted to see how haha
[3:59:06] BobTheMartin: How close to the tower do you need to land
[3:59:08] w0blz: i think it will trigger once you levitate high enough so then chute to it
[3:59:12] lucky_boy505: tf
[3:59:13] mikturnal: check if you need the first one
[3:59:13] sorrywhatdidyousay: you’re so close it might just give you the first checkpoint
[3:59:17] ghost_caolannnnn: hi @darkviperau
[3:59:19] zay2krazy4u: hi
[3:59:19] lucky_boy505: He flying
[3:59:29] darkj_ev: motorbike!!!!
[3:59:32] PurifiedShino: Parachute to glide over the other triggers.
[3:59:34] Abdiel_Kavash: You also got the conversation before when you just flung yourself near the roof, without landing on top of it.
[3:59:41] Edmiy: Who'd thought this would be the hardest mission
[3:59:42] mistrz_motyl: Can you parachute to the last "checkpoint" on first place?
[3:59:44] crvstys0ck: Martin madrazo is gonna be waiting a long time for his money
[3:59:52] Murphimself: oh god youre right he climbed on the car OMEGALUL
[3:59:53] dillysinghlol: will this be on YouTube
[3:59:54] wishfullcar: I think if you do it close to the checkpoint you dont have to land on the roof
[3:59:55] TheGaminNorwegian: Which is why it would be smart to not use the parachute the first time when you have to trigger the first checkpoint. But use the parachute when you gotta get to the vent
[4:00:06] blurghblurgh4: Jumped
[4:00:16] Wygser: i am pretty sure he could tlevitate once glide across the first roof and land on the second one
[4:00:16] dengostolemybaby: Can you just land directly on the vents without needing to be at the top of the ladder
[4:00:21] Murphimself: dviperNoted
[4:00:22] lucky_boy505: Is this a test run?
[4:00:23] VB2095: @crvstys0ck "Why did it take you so long??"
[4:00:23] disczera: @TheGaminNorwegian but then you take fall damage
[4:00:28] dillysinghlol: hello matto
[4:00:29] wood333999: try parachuting to the top of the vent and see if it triggers the first checkpoint
[4:00:33] tomo2016tomo: You could probably glide over the first checkpoint and head to the 2nd
[4:00:35] vleague101: if you have to do this several times will the boxes stay for that long?
[4:00:46] VB2095: @crvstys0ck "Well I was trying to ..levitate"
[4:00:48] lander_p: Aren't you "climbing" onto the car?
[4:00:55] TheGaminNorwegian: @disczera I mean, he could just not go as high the first time. Maybe he wouldnt die.
[4:00:56] LutriTink: i admire your patience
[4:01:03] k4rakal: maybe you can trigger the first checkpoint just by parachuting over it?
[4:01:04] BobTheMartin: How close to the tower do you need to land after hitting the tooltip? Could do vents
[4:01:05] marshalisepic: You jumped and climbed the car
[4:01:06] Iv7n: @lander_p hes testing but he wont be climbing when he acc does it
[4:01:07] CaptainPuff: @lander_p just for testing
[4:01:07] crvstys0ck: @vb2095 lol

[4:01:24] mrm9734: Save parachute for AC?
[4:01:24] BobTheMartin: How close to the tower do you need to land after hitting the tooltip? Could do straight to vents maybe
[4:01:24] sorrywhatdidyousay: yes
[4:01:24] wishfullcar: I think if you do it close to the checkpoint you dont have to land on the roof
[4:01:25] vaporwaved: when you jumped close to the building it already triggered, maybe you can trigger it while parachuting straight to the second checkpoint
[4:01:25] xerxil: Doesn't the 1st checkpoint trigger when you reach a certain height?
[4:01:25] jaj170: :)
[4:01:27] Edmiy: Is the speed fps dependent
[4:01:28] w0blz: @lander_p he means climbing which requires all 4 limbs at once,, climbing stairs or into a car doesnt
[4:01:28] CaptainPuff: This isn't even that bad compared to pacifist, right?
[4:01:29] tomo2016tomo: You could probably glide over the first checkpoint and head to the 2nd

[4:01:55] dd_nomoney: chat it’s a test run he knows he’s jumping
[4:01:57] k4rakal: can you trigger the first checkpoint just by parachuting over it?
[4:01:59] w0blz: if you levitate close to the checkpoint then parachute over? or am i missing something @DarkViperAU
[4:02:01] PushyMcButtons: why "second one"? if you have ladder tutorial, can you not just go to the vent
[4:02:05] shtbox_canyon: go up be the first check point on the roof then parachute to the top one
[4:02:06] sorrywhatdidyousay: you might be able to be close enough to get the first checkpoint before parachuting
[4:02:06] LutriTink: can you get height, glide over the first checkpoint and then land on the last?
[4:02:08] Wygser: i am pretty sure you could tlevitate once, glide across the first roof and land on the second one
[4:02:12] dillysinghlol: why do u wear black
[4:02:13] CertainSmoke: Fly past the first checkpoint in parachute on your way to the second
[4:02:15] Von_Doge: you are climbing in altitude tho
[4:02:16] das_oleg: levitate up near the first checkpoint and parachute to the nex
[4:02:20] mikturnal: yea, that would be nice
[4:02:22] w0blz: yes
[4:02:25] vaporwaved: it worked when you jumped close to it remember
[4:02:25] BobTheMartin: Because you triggered it by jumping around
[4:02:25] shtbox_canyon: yes
[4:02:28] spaffjd: you dont have to get of the glitch to get the first checkpoint
[4:02:29] RKJfishing: are you pressing jump to get on top of the car?

[4:02:33] the_random_0ne: You hit it at the scaffoilding earlier
[4:02:33] shtbox_canyon: that’s what we are saying
[4:02:34] Madicos: what if you press the ragdoll button while still levitating
[4:02:36] TheGaminNorwegian: @PushyMcButtons Because the tool tip only triggers the ability to get the first checkpoint at the top.
[4:02:39] Abdiel_Kavash: Yes, you got the conversation before with superjump by just flying near the roof, not landing on it.
[4:02:40] mikturnal: chat did he activate the ladder
[4:02:43] Thomcifer: on purpose you haven't gotten the prompt yet?
[4:02:44] OoMikkioO: but you didn't trigger the ladder
[4:02:45] sorrywhatdidyousay: if you levitate close to the first checkpoint, you could get it before parachuting
[4:02:45] MrHarlz_: you haven’t got the tooltip @darkviperau
[4:02:48] Wygser: another finally again xD and he didnt trigger the ladder
[4:02:49] BobTheMartin: You never triggered the ladder on this
[4:02:53] disczera: @mikturnal no its a test run
[4:02:55] Wygser: so he cant see if it works

[4:05:24] doejoey: better get to it then
[4:05:32] PurifiedShino: Or levitate from the south side and parachute over the triggers.
[4:05:33] CSGONobody: bike wall ride
[4:05:33] spaffjd: just dont waste the parachute on the first checkpoint
[4:05:37] mikturnal: you shouldn't need a parachute for the first one, no?
[4:05:38] CSGONobody: to get cp1
[4:05:38] FluxOxklint: buy lester a drone instead of a man with spy glasses
[4:05:38] chaosdented: How it's going? peepoHappy

[4:06:17] xtownhell: dviperDead dviperDead dviperDead dviperDead dviperDead
[4:06:23] CSGONobody: @DarkViperAU maybe try the bike wallride for cp1 then levitate for photo?
[4:06:23] PushyMcButtons: levitate near the first trigger and save the chute, there's enough scaffolding and stuff to break your fall - hopehopehope
[4:06:26] disczera: once
[4:06:26] VojtechStrnad: millions
[4:06:27] BobTheMartin: at least 1

[4:06:33] MZTC6293gg: like 15

[4:06:42] youshallloveeachother: can you drop without parachute onto the AC
[4:06:44] vleague101: couldn't you try to levitate the 1st levitation next to the yellow circle and then run to the wall to not use parachute?

[4:07:19] youshallloveeachother: can you drop onto any part of the roof without parachute from levitating without damage
[4:07:24] FluxOxklint: @DarkViperAU See if you cant find a prop inside of the construction site to use instead of boxes
[4:07:27] corey658: any pacifist updates? not trying to be annoying just genuinely curious

[4:11:16] xerxil: Abandon all of this and get an Oppressor
[4:11:18] shtbox_canyon: yes no maybe so
[4:11:18] vleague101: because you are close to lester
[4:11:19] wood333999: huh
[4:11:20] mistrz_motyl: No
[4:11:20] wishfullcar: Cops
[4:11:24] ashley_collins21: run Forrest run 😂
[4:11:25] Edmiy: Maybe because of the cops
[4:11:26] Wygser: that what i said like 1hour ago
[4:11:26] CSGONobody: not outdistancing lester
[4:11:26] MrHarlz_: um?

[4:11:28] FluxOxklint: yess
[4:11:29] shtbox_canyon: cops

[4:11:33] Loleyoxd: have you tried flying?
[4:11:33] Jackilichous: i imagine its hard to escape cops in the small area
[4:11:33] wood333999: did cops stop you mission failing
[4:11:34] GameRollGTA: If you have the cops you don’t fail from distance?
[4:11:35] sorrywhatdidyousay: cuz u have the cops??

[4:11:43] mikturnal: this game is confusing
[4:11:47] corrosivescorpion: Have Lester lift you onto the roof
[4:11:49] Wygser: the reset range got bigger everytime you triggered that
[4:11:49] MrHarlz_: YOU NEED THE TOOLTIP TO TRIGGER THEN U CAN GO WHERVER
[4:11:49] Fossabot: dviperPolice THIS IS THE RESET POLICE dviperPolice dviperPolice STEP AWAY FROM THE RESET BUTTON OR WE WILL TAKE ACTION dviperPolice
[4:11:52] breeezus_: you could get another chute
[4:11:53] Murphimself: cause you hit the checkpoint?
[4:11:55] Sleicreider: Practice the bike jump, in case there is one
[4:11:56] tomo2016tomo: cargobob?
[4:11:57] lucky_boy505: Run matt Run
[4:12:00] Wygser: you cant park lester and go get a chopper or blimp
[4:12:02] Murphimself: find a cargobob Kappa
[4:12:02] xerxil: This might make daisy chain an option
[4:12:04] primord_ial: hire someone strong and make them throw you onto the roof
[4:12:09] eldergrove_maggs: helicopter?
[4:12:09] MrSmooth360: Bing BongoCat
[4:12:13] ticklemyhugepickl: you can drive to mount.  chilliad for another parachute

[4:12:14] mikturnal: Bing BongoCat
[4:12:15] primepotatoes: you can daisy chain
[4:12:16] tpcomedy: tpcomedy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months! Love all the challenge runs and thinking outside the box
[4:12:16] seekingtreasure: Bing BongoCat
[4:12:16] Fossabot: Helllll Yeeaaahh dviperHappy
[4:12:17] Wygser: or blimp
[4:12:17] GameRollGTA: Extremely unlikely but maybe a cargobob?
[4:12:18] LutriTink: portal guns
[4:12:22] Murphimself: buy a cargobob!
[4:12:22] referenci4: With the wanted level you can drive away and get a heli or parachute
[4:12:23] zachh_f: Cargobob and pick up the car
[4:12:25] hector0896: Get cargo Bob to lift car
[4:12:26] Thomcifer: if only cargobobs wasn't so hard to get in single player
[4:12:30] Jackilichous: thats what it seems to me
[4:12:32] shtbox_canyon: yes
[4:12:32] X6UR: ITS THE TOOLTIP
[4:12:33] dat1rash: dviperWave dviperWave dviperWave
[4:12:33] tollkirsche7: when the yellow dot disappears probably
[4:12:36] k4rakal: I would guess they want you to be able to hide and loose the cops
[4:12:38] MrSmooth360: someone said the tool tip is the trigger to allow it
[4:12:39] vleague101: could also be the ladder triggering?
[4:12:43] PotatoeHX: look, accidentally found new bug lmao
[4:12:47] tomo2016tomo: He said climb to the top of chilliad
[4:12:53] MrHarlz_: yes yes I said that
[4:12:56] breeezus_: would the parachute spawn in the mission tho
[4:12:57] brwinner5350: dviperWave
[4:12:58] FluxOxklint: I don't get why you need 2 parachutes, one is enough?
[4:12:59] primepotatoes: heli and daisy chain
[4:13:00] neonulled: what if you bring a helicopter to the garment factory before the mission and you slowly bring lester and the helicopter with you
[4:13:01] PurifiedShino: Is there any way to get the top of mile high club?
[4:13:08] wh1te101010: get a blimp now
[4:13:10] das_oleg: can't you take a helikopter to the mazebank-parachute?
[4:13:10] azzabirb: HES A GENIUS!
[4:13:11] mistrz_motyl: Parking behind vinewood letters

[4:13:25] Murphimself: thats your homie!
[4:13:25] mizzodacreator: you need him,
[4:13:29] lucky_boy505: @FluxOxklint You can never have to many parachutes
[4:13:33] xerxil: Daisy chain would be faster than parachute?
[4:13:34] das_oleg: aaaaah ok
[4:13:36] ZarzaSR: could you start the mission on a bike and bike fly to the ceiling?
[4:13:38] camstone179: @darkviperau drive and get a chopper from vespussie helipad you'll have to switch between both vehicles to stop from failing however the spawns are inconsistent this is what I did when I tried this challenge
[4:13:39] Wygser: @MrHarlz_ a bunch of people did, i am 99% certain he can just get a chopper now and "daisychein it"
[4:13:46] BlueJayKiller_: Heli won't work then
[4:13:49] crvstys0ck: Go to airport for helicopter?
[4:13:52] captain0314: Cargoboh
[4:13:55] shtbox_canyon: do tool tip then try and leave
[4:13:57] BonJoGame1: cargobob
[4:13:57] djkev101: BALDDDD
[4:14:07] spaffjd: why do u need 2 parachutes cant you just ragdoll on the first checkpoint
[4:14:10] PurifiedShino: @crvstys0ck This is story mode not online.
[4:14:11] shtbox_canyon: no leave and see if it fails
[4:14:13] vaporwaved: tooltip acquired dviperBlueball
[4:14:13] Murphimself: FeelsWeirdMan

[4:14:32] mikturnal: dviperNoted
[4:14:34] shtbox_canyon: leave now to see if it fails
[4:14:35] wh1te101010: blimp is the only way
[4:14:36] Fossabot: Follow me at https://twitter.com/DarkViperAU for cute animal pictures, inane prattle and politics.
[4:14:36] Wygser: @DarkViperAU how about triggering the tooltip, daisychaining to a blimp or a second chute?
[4:14:37] X6UR: Why not just give it 1 or 2 tries?
[4:14:41] tankslv: dviperHmm dviperHmm
[4:14:42] slothehhh: we're in too deep man, we have to finish what we started dviperBongo
[4:14:46] BlueJayKiller_: Cargobob sounds good,  but levitation is easier ig
[4:14:50] goldenspadle: RIGGED
[4:14:54] sorrywhatdidyousay: i think you can run up the infernus
[4:14:59] Von_Doge: sick puppy peepoSmash

[4:15:08] Skvllhead: this is the best way to spend valentines day tbh
[4:15:09] FMB_Player: Guys, this is not GTA Online, you can't just find half an army of helicopters on the airport. The cargobob doesn't just spawn like everyone has one.
[4:15:10] lnjouable: can't run up that small car?
[4:15:12] Thomcifer: cargobob is near impossible to get in single player
[4:15:12] xerxil: Did he trigger tooltip?
[4:15:19] mikturnal: @xerxil yes
[4:15:20] Ermanhaut: I guess the only chance you have is just to hover the whole roof with the parachute and hope it triggers both checkpoints and land on top of the vents
[4:15:20] LorshZontek: How long has he been on this mission lol
[4:15:21] shtbox_canyon: yes he did
[4:15:22] disczera: @xerxil yes

[4:15:51] CSGONobody: mybe u can run up the infernus?
[4:15:54] mrm9734: Why arent you doing it at the bus stop????
[4:15:54] Iv7n: that supercar looks climable
[4:15:56] prolific_sty: not use it in mission
[4:15:59] isaacdagoat24: MATTO YOUR SCARING ME WITHOUT A BEARD
[4:16:01] mikturnal: NOOO

[4:17:03] sorrywhatdidyousay: both wheels on the curb?
[4:17:07] Kalvineur: ameno
[4:17:11] frankzdatank: @disczera for some reason I don't trust you
[4:17:13] das_oleg: and at the damm by the casino should be a parachute too
[4:17:17] Murphimself: this is all explained in facts and glitches which is required viewing for the stream FeelsOkayMan
[4:17:20] X6UR: YOU WERE LEVITATING
[4:17:21] captain0314: You were just levitating

[4:18:02] Wygser: infernus to crub as ramp?
[4:18:05] LiituX: Lester is one patient dude
[4:18:07] king_phisher69: Bike looks way cooler thob
[4:18:12] frankzdatank: You can have 2 jumps
[4:18:15] lucasf2006: you should get a boat
[4:18:25] disczera: @frankzdatank no you should completely trust me because i 100% know what im saying all the time Kappa
[4:18:34] Thomcifer: can't levitate from the infernus?
[4:18:50] Thomcifer: forget it have to be on curb

[4:20:07] xerxil: What if after 1st checkpoint you can't drive too far
[4:20:07] sorrywhatdidyousay: what if it just gives you the checkpoint while you levitate
[4:20:07] neonulled: Just fall down where the ladder is at

[5:34:46] imgoodwithusernames: just vote Spider-Man guys
[5:34:47] cxz_cxz_v9: maybe try ramping off the car with lester with altstrat on the red building,the side you need to be on
[5:34:49] Andre_m7: Maybe you can't move a car away before seeing the ladder
[5:34:54] MrSmooth360: For those who missed it. Matt does not wanna do the cargobob strat as it is next to impossible to get in single player. Please stop suggesting it dviperLove
[5:35:01] xhendi101: 1 hit ko mirror world one day matto

[5:35:35] faNduBBLez: wr pace???
[5:35:42] disczera: @MrSmooth360 i mean at this point if he hunted a cargobob from the start it would have probably been faster lol
[5:35:43] shtbox_canyon: he also said he wasn’t gonna daisy chain a bike but here we are
[5:35:48] mrm9734: @purifiedshino he should. He would save heeps of time

[5:36:36] Gifi4: @cqm0x The thing is though, if there's 100 people with the same problem as you, that's a lot for the mods to go through to correct
[5:36:44] YouEverW0nderWhyWeAreHere: @zomglie haha
[5:36:45] shtbox_canyon: @youshallloveeachother it’s the internet get over it
[5:36:49] PurifiedShino: @mrm9734 well he isn't. Just because you think you're right.
[5:36:56] cgilroy22_: @regynate you can it's just unlikely, pretty sure Matt evne said it
[5:36:56] youshallloveeachother: @cqm0x I don't think they have to explain anything

[6:29:28] PurifiedShino: can you boost jump off the fountain or those solid bushes?
[6:29:33] darkj_ev: Theres a certain angle you have to hit the wall to perform a good wallclimb. You have to lean back a little bit but not too much. Kinda like attack the wall with your front tire. This is the best tip I can give
[6:29:36] absentrilez: @Wryfrost matto do this pls
[6:29:36] univ_bayou: can those boxes work?
