[1:23:06] Seetherrr: @BionicFireman i think the problem is frivolous objections that break up the flow of the case and requires every question to have an argument over the objections and then the question has to be repeated
[1:23:35] Dhaaru: maybe a check-in process is needed 24ish hours before trial to confirm people are coming to avoid wasting the courts time?
[1:23:55] SoIafar: or if the objection only forces a reformulation of the question and doesn't affect the trial at all

[4:13:48] Crosis86: oh no they are going to make the judges mad
[4:13:55] LCmira: they about to talk themselves out of a positive verdict
[4:14:01] Crosis86: ohhhh nooo
[4:14:20] Crosis86: the grief inc
[4:14:22] MeggidoMuneblaze: it sounds like they should have filed an appeal then
[4:14:32] mlangcs: should have filed an appeal
[4:14:35] mlangcs: tough luck
[4:14:38] Fastburn_: ^
[4:14:43] Fastburn_: But.. also is bad.
[4:14:50] Crosis86: yep
[4:15:37] Crosis86: they dropped the ball
[4:15:41] Crosis86: it was an easy appeal
[4:15:41] Erigzback: lol
[4:15:43] mlangcs: they did yeah
[4:15:47] MeggidoMuneblaze: me thinks they didnt know you could see the time stamp on that
[4:15:50] Hento: cops and lawyers both just dropping balls
[4:15:56] Crosis86: LOL
[4:15:59] rachelkachel: occamTea
[4:16:03] rachelkachel: get 'em montag
[4:16:03] Hento: now you are in the ball pit
[4:16:04] laerin101: SKIP
[4:16:05] d0ubleDang: Lol
[4:16:08] Fastburn_: Cops messed up, but they could have easily got a W
[4:16:22] Archaius: so how can we conclude this bot the police and the lawyers dont do their work
[4:16:22] Crosis86: montag about to say fuck you get out
[4:16:28] wellingtonsmom: Montage is yelling skip
[4:16:28] Archaius: that is such a classic
[4:16:47] Crosis86: rosa oh no
[4:16:50] Crosis86: shes pushing it
[4:16:56] MeggidoMuneblaze: Maybe he should come back in a week and try again if they want to make such a big deal out of this
[4:16:57] mlangcs: shes pushing it so far
[4:17:20] Archaius: could roach put in a bar complaint against his lawyer for this
[4:17:28] MoscowDisco: i feel like tommy totally would KEKW
[4:17:30] MeggidoMuneblaze: @Archaius he could sue for malpractice
[4:17:32] MoscowDisco: he seems petty enough LUL
[4:17:38] mlangcs: Roach sues
[4:17:40] Fastburn_: He s hould
[4:17:46] wellingtonsmom: I hope so Archaius, but I doubt he will
[4:17:58] Crosis86: i was hoping montag was about to slap them across the cross room
[4:18:19] Ellzybub: what was the issue with not appealing, she said it was not from lack of trying. I wonder what that means
[4:18:58] Crosis86: they dropped the ball ellzy that the simplest part
[4:19:08] kanorel: KEKW
[4:19:11] MeggidoMuneblaze: the issue probably is that evilshatner has been pulling 16 hour streams almost daily and is probably so cooked that she forgot something cause shes absolutely fried
[4:19:26] MeggidoMuneblaze: she needs like a day off to recharge lol
[4:19:29] Fastburn_: WAsn't just her though
[4:19:34] Fastburn_: Another lawyer dropped the ball before her.
[4:19:46] Crosis86: sounds like everyone dropped it
[4:19:49] Crosis86: cops and lawyer
[4:19:53] MeggidoMuneblaze: well that lawyer probably doesnt have the same excuse lol
[4:20:04] MeggidoMuneblaze: yeah burton absolutely screwed up it sounds like
[4:20:09] wellingtonsmom: Roach also felt bad for bugging Rosa because everytime he asked her about it she seemed frazzled and preoccupied with Todd's case
[4:20:36] MeggidoMuneblaze: oh yeah she was greco locked for the last month about the cobalt stuff too

[4:57:35] SADSev: That explanation made my head hurt
[4:58:33] laerin101: isnt the constructive possession for the driver, not passenger?
[4:59:05] Hento: if they are just arguing constructive possession they would have to just say it could be accessed by either of em
[4:59:16] Hento: the car is in his name isnt really an argument

[5:24:34] SADSev: it’s fine play another perma character and change legislation again :P
[5:24:36] mlangcs: hopefully there is some help and more freedom with magistrate/judges because it feels like unless montag joy or katya sign a subpoena its not getting done
[5:24:51] fuzzmunky: cost of being so competent
[5:25:20] fuzzmunky: occamCult occamCult occamCult
[5:25:24] mlangcs: maybe it just feels like that because every time i see you on montag i see like 3-5 judges around and just you having to review them
[5:25:30] mlangcs: it can be like timing thing
[5:26:11] SADSev: that’s it? time for 10 more :)
[5:27:23] rachelkachel: occamNote
[5:27:37] mlangcs: wait Montag has to do the INGAME announcements too through the app for all this changes he is making?
[5:27:42] Klan_Itsme: makes sense
