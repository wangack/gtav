[7:00:15] therepoman77: Said he go lucky on some stocks
[7:00:18] cess001gg: thats why LUL
[7:00:20] Fhyziqal_: bro won alot of senior bun payslip gambles LuL
[7:00:21] audy: also yeah no 4head too weigh him down PEPW
[7:00:22] Hachiman1997: He doesn't waste money
[7:00:24] Raapid: ingevar about to start flipping burgers
[7:00:27] snitchellrobinson: srs buns during the day, chopping at night u can make like 15k a day
[7:00:28] epic_smee: It adds up tbh, Most people are at 50k right now. If he spend that on the PC
[7:00:37] scha_de: He doesnt have a 4head peepoBurnMoney
[7:00:49] audy: 4head burns money PEPW
[7:00:55] Mitashkii: @snitchellrobinson if you have smoeone with crowbar that is
[7:01:10] epic_smee: The people that tow all day also make some cash
[7:01:23] timbres: Think about how much money you’d have if literally all you did was tow, chop, Sr Buns, etc
[7:01:48] audy: how close are we to 3 Quarters of the way to the goal
[7:02:06] Qwaz: im sure theres a reason you always see the same people at sanitation grinding
[7:02:06] Mitashkii: does Dez have more money than AK? he's doing only G6
[7:02:07] audy: 75%
[7:02:12] epic_smee: @nidas Well seems like He doesnt really have a group, so you default quicker to grinding If no RP falls into your lap
[7:02:23] kappakenji31: 19k off
[7:02:31] audy: ohh ok lemme do some math
[7:02:35] timbres: I’d bet there’s someone with half a mil on the server already
[7:02:38] CopperKat: all the gruppe 6 people seem to put their money straight back into the trucks. I guess they won’t get robbed as much when guns happen.
[7:02:39] BotDoris: bra fart peepoGiggles
[7:02:46] epic_smee: G6 is crazy money
[7:02:54] audy: 60%
[7:02:57] reyvanr: Doris??
[7:02:59] senlash: peepoGiggles
[7:03:07] Hachiman1997: Can you really get the house by Friday?
[7:03:07] senlash: really???
[7:03:10] senlash: tired already??
[7:03:15] trust_the_rust: 4head, ming and fanny spent soooo much time chopping for almost no money
[7:03:18] Chewp: say the same shit all day for a week
[7:03:21] senlash: nothin like the old days Oldge
[7:03:33] RU8H: its a lot of work for little money
[7:03:39] RU8H: and takes so long to get it cleaned
[7:03:39] Qwaz: well materials tho
[7:03:40] therepoman77: Wonder what stock he put his money into
[7:03:43] thermalnemisis1: Its fun tho
[7:03:44] Sehpron: time to scout offline nidas chat on discord NODDERS
[7:03:44] Raapid: everyone will refer to you as the raffle guy from now on
[7:03:44] Ylicxtop: device cost 6k
[7:03:45] wishmaker10: @trust_the_rust cause they are fucking around losing bills through pd fines, VU etc
[7:03:45] reagon_plays: 6k device and cleaning takes a long time
[7:03:51] SamEatsALot: people do it because its fun but its not worth at all
[7:03:53] CopperKat: Fanny is waiting on like 4k lost rolls
[7:03:53] Xpatrol: i mean Ming & Fanny didnt Chop for long this week
[7:03:54] GoutOfWar: mhm bidness costs
[7:03:54] somebadtiming: 2400 per night is good
[7:03:55] trust_the_rust: not if they never get it cleaned
[7:03:59] snitchellrobinson: hard to clean the rolls cause VU rates are shit and machines didnt work for a while
[7:04:01] Mitashkii: taking it down the sewer is tedious af
[7:04:03] timbres: It’s more fun and more risk so maybe that’s the appeal vs more money
[7:04:07] CasQ77: Cleaning money part is the hard part i guess
[7:04:11] gbriggs33: they save the parts then cash in at once
[7:04:17] wishmaker10: ye but its only at night and also 2 cars a night
[7:04:21] bjerre6969: i believe it is because they think it is fun
[7:04:24] gbriggs33: so that’s why I don’t think the money is instant
[7:04:25] senlash: Washing
[7:04:27] RU8H: the laundry machines only just started working properly
[7:04:36] arcraz: I guess Ming can't grind that much because he is missing prio?
[7:04:37] Qwaz: Washing
[7:04:39] CasQ77: that is like 8 dollars every x minutes
[7:04:41] trust_the_rust: honestly think 4head put the most in the VU and got nothing back rly
[7:04:43] SamEatsALot: I think weed is gonna be op in long run
[7:04:50] BigLil: dont forget the money goes through 4head
[7:04:58] AloofMango: @arcraz No it's because he is busy erping SMH
[7:05:12] Zhachi1250: That one day they lost a good 6k to scuff to the rolled bills poofing when passing them to someone
[7:05:14] RU8H: plus theres been a lot of scuffs with the rolls, weed, laundry machines disappearing
[7:05:18] epic_smee: One week of grinding and you are done though. A House seems to be the biggest Investment possible on the server. Everything after is easy
[7:05:18] Mitashkii: this is definetly slower than the 3.0 start
[7:05:21] snitchellrobinson: best group in terms of content, worst group for grinding LUL
[7:05:23] SamEatsALot: @arcraz yeah I hope he gets prio, he is stuck in queue for 6 hours sometimes
[7:05:25] joelpepg: u r like the only group on the server that doesn't have house yet nnysICANT
[7:05:35] thermalnemisis1: Its prob gonna be u dez a Dhead contributing to the house for most part rlly
[7:05:37] willin88: Is 4.0 a little too grindy at the moment? I've enjoyed watching a lot but every stream is essentially people grinding. May be taking away from RP a little? There's a balance
[7:05:40] trust_the_rust: true scuff, seizure and VU is where all the chopping money went
[7:05:41] Zhachi1250: and its 4head so he doesnt care, he just rolls with the lose
[7:05:55] Qwaz: tons of people dont have houses
[7:05:55] timbres: It’s nothing against the rest but it does feel like it’s mainly been Ingevar, Dez and 4head contributing financially
[7:06:03] CopperKat: tbh 4head has taken most of fanny/ming chop profits
[7:06:08] RU8H: there are way bigger groups still without houses
[7:06:09] epic_smee: @mitashkii in 3.0 the playerowned restaurants generated an insane amount of Money,which moved into the economy
[7:06:22] Qwaz: ing is the only one actually really selling tickets
[7:06:28] meego0o: thats why this is the best group
[7:06:28] RU8H: and besides this has been a really refreshing group of people to watch. feels so fresh.
[7:06:36] Eku007: NODDERS
[7:06:40] senlash: LGiggle
[7:06:41] trust_the_rust: it would have been a bit boring to watch tbf
[7:06:45] redwineterroirist: it's like herding cats KEKW
[7:06:49] timbres: Fanny really could’ve used her birthday as a raffle sales tactic
[7:06:53] GoutOfWar: maaaaan
[7:06:54] kaivaIya: without state loans there actually stories related to getting assets instead of going in debt first
[7:06:56] Brodoswagings: rping over grinding? not the streamer i followed anymore nidasfieldJam
[7:06:58] AloofMango: too many RPers ReallyMad
[7:06:58] mortuusintus12: agreed haha.
[7:07:02] realitijd24: some organization after the house
[7:07:05] senlash: nidasfieldJam
[7:07:06] Krokzter: classic nidas always choosing money over rp
[7:07:10] Raapid: maybe sing as a side hustle
[7:07:13] senlash: wheres my min max streamer nidasfieldJam
[7:07:13] Mitashkii: @epic_smee i think no store roberies, fleca's paleto's is what really slows it down now LUL
[7:07:15] Kikobri_: Nidas changed...
[7:07:19] Chewp: The raffle breeds fun interactions
[7:07:27] Chewp: it's done though
[7:07:43] trust_the_rust: house is gonna be an unlock and RP hub, gonna be great
[7:07:46] timbres: Fannys auction thing might bring good money
[7:07:54] CasQ77: until now everyone that ive watched with a house has been enjoying them a lot
[7:08:04] BotDoris: doris is very inconsistent
[7:08:04] Hachiman1997: Trueee
[7:08:05] Qwaz: yeah, this is the best part of any server wipe
[7:08:08] SamEatsALot: marty's casino will be a banger as well I think. especially if he get you along with him
[7:08:10] trust_the_rust: true
[7:08:11] senlash: furnace belly peepoS
[7:08:14] the_nano_horseschlong: Prayge this car gets raffle´d off soon we dont have to listen to this sound anymore cyrOk
[7:08:20] snitchellrobinson: real question is who is decorating the house LUL
[7:08:20] Eku007: FOMO
[7:08:24] Raapid: yeah
[7:08:28] Chewp: Just pretend to be rich to fuck with the people who grinded
[7:08:28] LaughyDaffy206: raffle a computer LUL
[7:08:30] realitijd24: yea thats why i like the slow progress
[7:08:31] willin88: LOL it's just like real life
[7:08:36] Sahil6255: 1 hr before tsunami ResidentSleeper
[7:08:38] Hachiman1997: It's becoming eSports true
[7:08:41] epic_smee: @mitashkii nope not really. Robberies were not really profitable. But the payslips from Restaurants plus the actual Profit of the Restaurant going to a player generated a lot. And Meth made a lot of money
[7:08:41] senlash: nidas living that Turner / Dinkleberg live Sadge
[7:08:44] cess001gg: its the feeling you get when you watch 18 year olds posting about how they made 10 million last month
[7:08:49] Qwaz: just do one really big scam EZ
[7:08:50] mortuusintus12: so give some slack to 4head chat. based on stats, hes not really dragging down the group, just made some unquestionable decisions
[7:08:56] CopperKat: Yeah once the house is done there’s not really huge stuff to buy other than cars
[7:09:04] thermalnemisis1: Maybe joining marty in his casino would be good u could run the basement
[7:09:05] haftsss: bless you
[7:09:05] Fishnet83: Prosit Prayge
[7:09:05] Knebo_: prosit
[7:09:06] notmaeri: bless you
[7:09:10] meego0o: Just remibd urself thst there are many ppl who dont even want a computer... so it doesnt really matter
[7:09:19] noombus: I really like what you guys do though. Establishing RP based income rather than spamming G6 and jobs.
[7:09:19] Sehpron: PauseChamp
[7:09:20] epic_smee: @mitashkii imo at least. Burger Shot workers had cars asap

[7:09:26] JackLDN27: PausersHype
[7:09:32] Eku007: PausersHype
[7:09:32] Mitashkii: @epic_smee meth was way down the line, and only player owned restourant and beggining of 3.0 was RR, DW owned BS and horded the money
[7:09:33] RU8H: Prayge more than 1 ticket
[7:09:36] timbres: 4head is the businessman of the group, it must be tiresome
[7:09:36] Chewp: Ingevar can nonchalantly lie about wealth, kind of fits his personality

[7:15:46] willin88: The weird part I think about is an RP'er like Burn who creates like a new character per day. Pure RP characters. How are those characters going to survive with no money and like $500 at character spawn
