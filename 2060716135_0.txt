[2:04:16] Z3phs: they raid you if you have Government equipment or drugs, are you gonna have any of those? doesnt matter if you get caught
[2:04:17] nosebeersx: raids happened because people had PD weapons, or large amounts of drugs/etc
[2:04:19] cfbonde: i does make sence but people wanna get on with it i guess
[2:04:19] Tibs97: @armor3dx, Awkward time me out @CRlCK .. It seems that armor knows I need it.

[4:03:03] StreamElements: Do not share in-game information regarding other players/content creators. Acie doesn't want to know and this can instead harm in-game decisions. This may result to a time out or ban without warning. (Meta-gaming is when you tell Acie what a different streamer is doing on the same server) Thank you.

[6:28:03] MonMunn: Rime
[6:28:06] Tuga_cef: why only yours bugged? many ppl use doors inside
[6:28:09] AFFABLE__: Its because of rotation value on the thick wall the previous thin wall was perfectly in line with the floor.

[8:03:11] niteflyeruzi: My monitor is bugged, my boots are scuffed. (there's a literal gnat dead between the monitor lights and the outer layer.  I thought it was ON the outer layer when I killed it.  <sigh>
[8:03:12] Linds_Brohan: @amelia_violete She got paid in exposure
[8:03:14] RenOfficially: @g4mbl_3 bugged sounds like a "technical issue" while scuffed sounds like "broken" ig?
[8:03:32] joac1144: You got experience YEP
[8:03:43] Flugger1: And the USB
[8:03:47] amelia_violete: @linds_brohan based
[8:03:50] fate024: The experience was really valuable
[8:03:50] g4mbl_3: @RenOfficially you've got it backwards
[8:03:50] retarcl: @Tibs97 @Tibs97 ill check it out
[8:03:54] slothqueeni: do you loose points for saying things? Maybe I'm dumb but what do you all mean by -1?
[8:04:04] kwznv: no you got a usb stick , THATS A LOT
[8:04:09] amelia_violete: what‚Äôs the usb for ?
[8:04:15] Ginoveli: just say busted
[8:04:24] Linds_Brohan: @slothqueeni Imaginary point system for breaking/keeping roleplay
[8:04:28] kwznv: @amelia_violete  find in rp
[8:04:29] Ginoveli: i know my slang
[8:04:30] RenOfficially: @RenOfficially I scuffed my boots or i bugged my boots? which sounds more correct to you?
[8:04:41] g4mbl_3: @RenOfficially if it's bugged it's broken, scuffed is like scrapped, it's a little fucked but can be managed
[8:04:42] slothqueeni: @Linds_Brohan ah, thank you
[8:04:47] Diealated: fr fr on god no cap bussin'
[8:04:50] niteflyeruzi: @g4mbl_3 Nah, I agree with OP.  Bugged is a technical problem, scuffed is physical damage.
[8:04:52] Flugger1: Just say Bricked PepeLaugh
[8:04:53] Diealated: just say that
[8:05:00] Tibs97: duckass

[8:05:22] MonMunn: lol raia
[8:05:23] Linds_Brohan: Daniel is a hater
[8:05:32] Nulltiply: Bad balancing
[8:05:36] Ginoveli: yeah
[8:05:41] Villenthessis: Daniel hates everyone except Snr Buns WeirdDude
[8:05:42] BlindFlapjack: Apparently you lose 1% rep for every job you do
[8:05:43] Ginoveli: it seems painful just watching
[8:05:45] Diealated: @niteflyeruzi all context. a scuff is a physical mark, but scuffed can mean a situation is shot, fucked up, gone awry, not according to plan
[8:05:49] g4mbl_3: wtf are you guys not getting lol. Scuffed is not broken, bugged is, so if it's not working, it's bugged....
[8:05:54] MALiiBU__: dos
[8:06:02] Praskle: yea seems pretty shit in comparison
[8:06:04] joac1144: I mean, maybe they purposefully made sani slow because it is so good
[8:06:06] Ginoveli: trying to get inheritor be like
[8:06:08] amelia_violete: intentional scuff

[8:07:02] hourtempo: YEP just 100 more hours of sani for 300 stars
[8:07:04] ZatashD: That's why Jason doesn't want to do anything other than G6
[8:07:11] Ginoveli: @kablard get some ice on it
[8:07:21] canikido: idk star system for gta tbh
[8:07:22] ashleyferns: Why is losing rep even a thing in no pixel?
[8:07:27] canikido: or for jobs

[8:07:33] chickennuggets35: classic
[8:07:37] RenOfficially: @g4mbl_3 idk my personal experience thats what the rp'ers use more for that situation its preferred that they dont say either of the words but idk.

[8:07:58] bailey7_: Omg you said that lol
[8:08:00] ribs010: Tolan was telling Jason that the other day, that recently daniel was getting very mad at him for doing Sani
[8:08:03] crazyiitopii: They should make the rep gain and decrease the same then
[8:08:04] crushertoxin: @bailey7_ ong frfr ICANT
[8:08:08] Capt4inJuli: it encourages people to trade and form a economy
[8:08:08] Flugger1: They only want you to do one job
[8:08:09] bailey7_: Double dip whT does that mean lol jk
[8:08:09] kwznv: g6-crims-sani people
[8:08:17] retarcl: om they got here too
[8:08:18] BlindFlapjack: Extremely punishing for double dipping. makes you only play 1 way which is weird
[8:08:19] bailey7_: Yes the apex release is
[8:08:22] ashleyferns: It encourages boring rp to just be a master of one
[8:08:26] Diealated: New apex season is happening tomorrow lol
[8:08:28] retarcl: are you nervous for tomorrow?
[8:08:36] vazeline__: Jason didn‚Äôt tell you guys?

[8:08:37] elli661: apex!!
[8:08:40] TheBlur11902: Apex Civ Gang
[8:08:41] crazyiitopii: How does it make sense you can get 300 g6 rep in 30 hours but it take 300 hours to get 300 rep in sani
[8:08:44] elli661: lmao
[8:08:44] StreamElements: LMAI PepeLaugh
[8:08:44] HotRod0_0: @bailey7_ working double jobs
[8:08:46] g4mbl_3: @RenOfficially I'm not talking about what people use more, I could say it's fine when it's broken af and I'm still wrong, just cause someone uses the word incorrectly a bunch does not make it the right use of the word lol.
[8:08:51] Diealated: Can't tell if it's gonna be fun, or just the same tired ass game but with new annoying mechanics
[8:08:52] deviusdark: titanfall better Madge
[8:08:59] bailey7_: @hotrod0_0 lol!
[8:09:04] RealWicari: @ashleyferns it encourages you to roleplay with others to get perks from other jobs, instead of one person doing it all by themselves
[8:09:07] Mr_Tvi: Apex with nora and Dimas ping would be so scuffed LUL
[8:09:16] RenOfficially: @RenOfficially This is RP chill man who cares haha

[8:09:57] Tibs97: duckass Û†ÄÄ
[8:10:02] CRlCK: @g4mbl_3 @RenOfficially agree to disagree?
[8:10:03] Tenivir: less rep stuff to care about all the time
[8:10:06] HotRod0_0: I guess materials run the economy so it makes sense sanitary is such a hassle to increase the rep
[8:10:09] bailey7_: You know things that are like not smart its not that its like super wrong to do its just not smart to do
[8:10:10] CanUHearMeDude: they want you to interact with other people I guess
[8:10:11] amelia_violete: it limits RP too **

[8:11:20] mmmurple: jason doesn't know you've accepted a new job
[8:11:23] Tenivir: yeah if anything being able to do one job limits interaction
[8:11:25] CanUHearMeDude: I mean trading and yes
[8:11:26] isp1337: interacting as you need other people for orther jobs
[8:11:28] realJokoWidodo: yes

[8:11:34] luciferkenz: unpopular opinion: drake and beyonce's music suck Awkward
[8:11:42] BlindFlapjack: i guess it's to make business units so a lumber gang, material gang etc
[8:11:42] Phasehero: Yah I think they want "gangs" to diversify
[8:11:46] crushertoxin: @luciferkenz yeah but drake has a big dick so...
[8:11:51] Kraenit: yeh, but its like every job tanks your rep so much
[8:11:51] Flugger1: Not really
[8:11:54] retarcl: @luciferkenz BASED
[8:11:55] ToTheSameHeights: Or you have to interact with other groups
[8:12:04] Mr_Tvi: It's basically making you pick a class.
[8:12:04] Kraenit: if you could have 2 jobs it would be nice
[8:12:05] HotRod0_0: Yeah you‚Äôve got it acie
[8:12:09] Flugger1: Some people just buy it all
[8:12:10] RealWicari: If you find out you need wood, you have to find a wood guy, instead of going out there by yourself to get it, its all about interactions
[8:12:24] retarcl: duckass
[8:12:27] SpecialAgentSkye: On god one cannot exist on the internet in any sense without drakes meat being mentioned multiple times a day Thinking
