[2:30:58] 42arc: @woodleaguelad started streaming recently, they prob revie every week who's streaming at what numbers
[2:31:05] M0US3E: He doesn't wanna do doctor since he consider it "cheating" to get in
[2:31:06] crazyiitopii: @kurrekurban Eugene did too once but Eugene also told Clay how to get prio
[2:31:13] Simpra_66: @42arc ICANT
[2:31:16] sadlebowski: he mainly talking only to civ gang and a little silent around other people, maybe thats why
[2:31:19] DataCookie: He did make a cop character so maybe from that he can get prio
[2:31:22] ironbullman: yes veder was saying everone in group should keep doing +1

[2:32:20] Tueur562: @kurrekurban yeah but if you do cop and go civ , that is cheating
[2:32:21] ALXD_: @DataCookie unless they changed it you can only use cop prio for cop and you have to use regular prio for other characters
[2:32:23] kurrekurban: but he has to play the cop if he gets it or they will be big mad
[2:32:26] undertothescore: @sixnineenjoyer He begged for Giantpanda and Nora apparently

[2:33:14] ZitroneSimo: Sani time Pog
[2:33:20] kurrekurban: far more likely he would've asked Buddha instead of xqc

[4:44:42] Caeros: cornwood is next lmao
[4:44:48] Markstrongbow: They literally tore the core of PD out. The rest of PD are literally just drones under Ruth
[4:44:49] qihk: denzel and cornwood
[4:44:49] Tenivir: yeah Sheisty is fully fired, he can rejoin academy in a week or two if he wants
[4:44:53] Akinda: yeah PD in shambles

[4:45:06] YoinkDoink: this darn liberals
[4:45:07] Sivvii_: yeah cornwood got very angry at the captains
[4:45:08] bLONDIID: peepoBoomer
[4:45:14] Tenivir: they are taking the rule riding a bit too hard rather than have good cops
[4:45:15] emrhys95: maybe that means dean is back back
[4:45:18] PkyBlinderDrLenz: PD better not be shocked when they’re gunned down daily soon…..
[4:45:30] Markstrongbow: I think it's time Cornwood look into starting the Sheriff's
[4:45:35] CRlCK: Cheer 100 it's okay
[4:45:41] Sivvii_: i think aziz also wanted to go on strike too idk if he still wants to
[4:45:42] Phasehero: @acie you saw the clip of Cornwood unloading 2 mags into a dead body and that's why is is suspended
[4:45:49] crazyiitopii: Being a cop is kinda hard lots of stuff to remember
[4:45:54] nonnahshannon: not the cheer 100 its okay acieLaugh
[4:45:55] Sivvii_: PD is in shambles
[4:46:01] furien_eh: thanks @crazyiitopii
[4:46:09] Tenivir: crazyiitopii yeah they already have the hardest jobs with so much stuff to know, they should have a little more slack
[4:46:11] crazyiitopii: @phasehero fun detected right
[4:46:18] Sivvii_: the police and policing themselves harder than actual crims
[4:46:18] icecreamnuke: Yeah the Captains said Pd has to be strict which is so boring
[4:46:26] PkyBlinderDrLenz: Server doesn’t like RP cops…..
[4:46:32] whyminton: cops are cops no good no bad ig
[4:46:35] Phasehero: @crazyiitopii yah Vader was talking about it a lot
[4:46:38] Caeros: anti-rp department
[4:46:48] crazyiitopii: @tenivir true plus from what I seen they are literally almost always taking Ls
[4:47:01] MrPhoNoodle: Is it worth depositing early for the risk of robbery?
[4:47:08] theace8869: Didn't they fire the guy who took the own cop hostage during the 2nd heist Civ Gang did?
[4:47:11] Sivvii_: they did denzel dirty and cornwood lost it
[4:47:18] Tenivir: be strict but its still a game to promote content and fun
[4:47:22] crazyiitopii: Fun cops like cornwood make it cool they are gonna regret suspending cornwood and denzel
[4:47:31] napkin4872: whos the one who has the final word in DP
[4:47:33] Tuga_cef: 200 ppl in a server where only 1/4 actually tries to rp LULW
[4:47:35] ZitroneSimo: is raia cooked LUL
[4:47:44] pickypics: this one is the best-Shouse - Love Tonight misspurpMoke misspurpMoke
[4:47:45] CRlCK: she is never not cooked but yea
[4:47:47] Caeros: everyone keeps saying it's the leadership, and it's the 5th time it's happened that they make a new pd. idk, i'm new to rp viewing
[4:47:49] Markstrongbow: There are cops genuinely that want to be chill and stuff, but Ruth makes it insufferable for them all.
[4:47:50] andrefvm: The problem is they are not consistent and there is no oversight over the captains
[4:47:51] DreamsPeek: Sometimes there develops a shift culture where theres a serious shift and a less TriHard shift, or split departments for the pd
[4:47:56] crazyiitopii: @phasehero I love when Vader talks not as Eugene but Vader dude be spitting facts
[4:48:15] Phasehero: @crazyiitopii Vader thinks is just because you are rping a cop. You need to have ethics
[4:48:20] simmeringteapot: Cornwood has the best cop rp wtf
[4:48:31] simmeringteapot: why would they fire him
[4:48:41] DreamsPeek: (Chat did she already see the  "clip""
[4:48:45] EnigmaticSageofFire: Cornwood not robotic enough for those in charge
[4:48:46] akhshitttt: What was jasons tweet
[4:48:50] xNeixen: it might finally be time for Clayton to become a cop OOOO
[4:48:51] nightingale3E: Viv is still on active duty...she's hilarious <3
[4:48:59] Strifes_de: 13/15 i think
[4:48:59] simmeringteapot: the captains are running the pd like it's irl, it's sad
[4:49:00] ekahS_: @DreamsPeek no, she is busy
[4:49:00] BubFrost: Pd rp have been gutted when a lot of cop mains switched servers
[4:49:08] Phasehero: Cornwood isn't fired he is suspended for 5 days @acie
[4:49:09] DaveShadows: shrug maybe it will give cornwood a chance for some other rp
[4:49:12] Sivvii_: least we get Dean quincy now. but sucks for shiesty
[4:49:13] Strifes_de: 1 more
[4:49:15] DreamsPeek: @ekahs_ G2kno
[4:49:19] theace8869: And they didn't want to hire Alex as a cop cuz he was too "confident"?
[4:49:23] Shikafrecko: 14
[4:49:54] crazyiitopii: @phasehero well if they had to RP cops like IRL the entire police force would get banned sadly KEKW
[4:49:57] icecreamnuke: Like you get punished for a small mistake and Den just made an unfortunate mistake and gott fired
[4:50:04] Mr_Tvi: Cornwood wants BCSO, capitans don't want a split in the pd. Friction happened
[4:50:06] momzzyy: hi acie hi chat

[4:51:02] gewehr43sniper: stay on nopixel.  kyle plays on onx lol
[4:51:04] miscelaneous: lots switched because of drama with the devs and owner
[4:51:08] Rockhound__97: Karma - cornwood gave a ticket to Raia and had to change her tint  :D
[4:51:08] icecreamnuke: Big characters like Eddie, Dean the Casino owner and Kyle went there
[4:51:12] DreamsPeek: @mr_tvi there used to be sections of police basically dedicated and allowed to rp with small brain syndrome
[4:51:15] Phasehero: @crazyiitopii oh I don't agree with Vader. It's a games let stupid shit happen for funz right?
[4:51:16] simmeringteapot: drama isn't really the issue, it's the overly invested chat hoppers
[4:51:17] noslo__: OnX is like days of our lives and no pixel is like Jack Ass
[4:51:18] joachimthecrab: yooo
[4:51:21] Strifes_de: dean twatted
