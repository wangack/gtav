[9:05:09] anakinnotthekids: Wouldn't that be a good thing for normal people who don't want a chase?

[9:05:28] not_kotleta: @not_kotleta KEK
[9:05:29] Gongie: To be fair, yo would straight DUST them in this in 10 seconds, so the chase is like theres no point tbh, it goes 180 KEK
[9:05:34] itsdweL: nodd
[9:05:36] Fugeki: I think they made a new rule because of reasons lol…

[9:05:58] itsdweL: Man, I wanna se you rail slide and then do  kickflip Sadge
[9:06:01] mornelithevt: It's also a non-frivolous charge.  They had you on trespassing only.  Wait for the car, and they've got you on GTA etc...

[9:06:03] suebae: Madge
[9:06:09] DoitwithDev: theres more then one chop happing at a time.
[9:06:17] mxckyyy_: they won't chase if it's an abvious joy ride.
[9:06:30] itzspiiin: ive noticed the pd now is different in terms of chases.. with how the poles are now.. theres a lot more risk IMO
[9:06:32] phinn01: yea PD priority in 4.0 is different than 3.0 as of right now nodd
[9:06:32] ignorantfall: its a pretty hard balancing act
[9:06:42] jackthedazzle: well fred again lost new artist nomniee
[9:06:42] ixidakonixi: and then all the drug pings definately need more
[9:06:43] wo0op213: Sr. Tiny Corleone the Grinder
[9:06:46] DogaBowl: when will the cop show happen?
[9:06:51] snshot04: yeah that cause I think Ssaab was explaining that they dont want prolonged chases so early into the server and with low cop numbers
[9:06:53] wo0op213: tony i mean
[9:07:03] alaskan485: why take the wheels off the car when you got the 2 spares in the back
[9:07:05] phinn01: we need more cops AAAA
[9:07:22] jackthedazzle: tony, fred again lost new artist nominee in grammy but kinda crazy tho
[9:07:25] Khul_Sardaukar: there's a bunch of cadets now
[9:07:33] itzspiiin: there needs to be more cops but the cops that have been hired need to show face.. they dont.. hence the low numbers
[9:07:35] snshot04: you also have to understand newer players are playing cop too and people will figure it out
[9:07:37] jackthedazzle: victoria monnett win
[9:07:38] alaskan485: there has been some crazy stuff happening with doj and cops too
[9:07:41] snshot04: just gotta trust the process
[9:07:43] vasco_02_: you have place for 1 tire in trunk and 1 in glove box
[9:07:44] Khul_Sardaukar: so few vet cops
[9:07:49] Ryleyy: people need to be properly trained not like 3.0 where people were W or L farming cops
[9:07:50] suebae: You need good cops not just numbers which takes time it will all work out with time
[9:07:55] Pdmac779: they don’t have enough PD yet, earlier they only had 6 on duty
[9:07:55] Valagore: i wonder if cost of the cop car repairs factors in
[9:07:56] ignorantfall: then people will complain about like 8 cops for a traffic stop. its like what do you do then
[9:07:56] mohawkdakidd: yea they dont want 300 cops like 3.0
[9:08:01] Gongie: Everyone polices a little differently
[9:08:02] OGbink: they tryna do it right
[9:08:03] Gongie: asell

[9:08:06] DoitwithDev: DAP
[9:08:07] DoitwithDev: lol
[9:08:09] lenny1287: variety in responses is also good though
[9:08:10] ignorantfall: cops need to rp, not think its real life
[9:08:16] Pdmac779: they want to have about 20 on at one time
[9:08:18] VisuallyRed: loving the chill vibes. is there still a stream tomorrow?
[9:08:25] Gongie: I do think them Hiring cops slower/crimes dropping slower is a good strat though, probably part of the plan
[9:08:28] phinn01: still early nodd
[9:08:30] snshot04: yeah they need time to build the PD right plus you entirely dont know what the cop was doing from their POV
[9:08:44] Bisssccy: I feel bad for the cops that are around now.
