[8:48:40] Kazori_: he did admit to picking them up, if you don't know it's stolen you can't really be reasoned for theft in that case. I would say at least
[8:48:44] sedmidivka: he's trying so hard to push it on him. if course it was him but if he went to bench trial he's not getting anything else than stolen goods. that's a fact. he cave push just because he wants to punish him and "he knows". he doesn't have evidence

[9:09:37] mavguy85: subpoenaed phone? lol
[9:09:40] Sstyyxx_: possession at best
[9:09:54] GingerBreadMayne: Literally by law it is just possession of stolen property.. People who RP are just trying to be "hard". Lol
[9:09:56] MOMO__o7: this is painful tho if he doesn’t get time served, like why should he call a lawyer again
[9:10:17] slomojosh: @momo__o7 lawyers can get plea deals
[9:10:19] lymah: @MOMO__o7 because you get lesser charges
[9:10:26] slomojosh: right now the angle should be for a plea
[9:10:35] MindlessSeb: first time getting arrested, AND getting a lawyer too AAAA
[9:10:38] slomojosh: a bench would just make this so much worse
[9:10:40] MindlessSeb: Mans never getting a lawyer again
[9:10:44] mavguy85: feels like he’s punishing the suspect for using his rights to get a lawyer. does he just want people to roll over instantly?
[9:10:47] original_khawk: @MOMO__o7 because its RP, not everything is about time or fine
[9:10:51] Sstyyxx_: shooting? with what guns?

[9:11:04] deimostrbl: @mavguy85 thats what i think too
[9:11:05] elphiesaint: if he is subpoenaing a phone shouldn’t it go to the docket?
[9:11:05] MOMO__o7: I don’t mean lawyers are bad chat, I just feel like it kills so much time
[9:11:17] Lilliphus: chat unless timothy is verbally complaining then you have no idea if he's upset or not, he's probably enjoying this
[9:11:34] Sstyyxx_: this has been great rp nevertheless…the banter is hilarious
[9:11:41] slomojosh: @sstyyxx_ true
[9:11:48] Brumorin: all of whats going on is valid rp
[9:11:51] EvilSandman01: @MOMO__o7 The upside is all the RP he's getting from this. Even if he has to sit in jail for 30 min. He get's to argue the cops with help from a lawyer
[9:12:38] slomojosh: the trespassing would vandalism and stolen would’ve been so much better
[9:12:41] sierramist72: lol knowing cornwoord hes goona go for robbery now lol
[9:12:43] MoonMike95: he won't let go of the robbery charge now
