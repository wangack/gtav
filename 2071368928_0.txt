[5:15:39] mattthetrucker95: as a semi truck driver if we cant slow down in time were taught to just run over the animal
[5:15:49] MarinoV1: as someone who handles auto claims every day, you should hit the animal.
[5:16:20] mattthetrucker95: its safer to hit the animal in all honesty
[5:16:30] MarinoV1: if you swerve and hit someone or something else, you are at fault.
[5:16:46] MarinoV1: hitting the animal is a non fault claim
[5:17:12] mattthetrucker95: ^^^ why as a truck driver we just plow through but then theres always the case where the animal can get snagged in the trailer air brake lines and break them and u have no breaks lol
[5:17:41] 1n53r7c01n: why we talking about hitting animals chat?
[5:17:43] MarinoV1: @mattthetrucker95 for sure. i've seen even relatively small animals total a car. but still, statistically better off hitting it.

[9:04:28] NemisizZ: coat?
[9:04:47] NemisizZ: for what? exactly
[9:05:02] NemisizZ: u prolly need some mold release
[9:05:02] Nightbot: IMGONNACUM
[9:05:28] NemisizZ: its like a spray kinda thing you spray it with when u make the mold
[9:06:17] NemisizZ: https://www.amazon.com/Mitreapel-Silicone-Mold-Release-Spray/dp/B0CTHR4D9Z
[9:06:25] kriskpin: heat and some time
[9:06:51] NemisizZ: altho it shouldnt really bind to silicone
[9:07:14] NemisizZ: but sometimes its just good to use, that way it just pops out
[9:08:26] NemisizZ: u mix it proper?
[9:08:26] Nightbot: IMGONNACUM
[9:08:43] NemisizZ: hmm
[9:09:04] NemisizZ: its the two component right?
[9:09:15] NemisizZ: might need a little more of the curing stuff
[9:09:27] NemisizZ: my bet is that it didnt get mixed proper
[9:11:06] NemisizZ: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_d_BjHFeVU
[9:12:02] NemisizZ: he mentions not mixed proper as well
[9:12:31] NemisizZ: u degas it to get rid of bubbles
[9:12:31] Nightbot: IMGONNACUM

[9:16:12] NemisizZ: yeah printing the mold might be the best tbh
[9:16:17] daffodil86: yeah try printing the mold + mold release should give a good pour
[9:16:28] DezalbM: im gunna laugh extra hard if they get robbed
[9:16:36] slorebear: how much does the uhh print fuel or whatever cost
[9:16:58] slorebear: oh so thats not bad at all
[9:17:21] NemisizZ: u might wanna look into max temp the resin can take as well when u get new resin then
[9:17:21] Nightbot: IMGONNACUM
[9:17:34] daffodil86: you'll def be limited by the size of the print bed tho
[9:17:40] NemisizZ: yeah

[9:18:38] daffodil86: good call Nemisizz never bought of that. What temp is the silicone during a pour?
[9:19:40] frigginoasis: travpiDWicked
[9:19:55] NemisizZ: @daffodil86 it was more if he wanted to print the mold instead, then it might need to be some more heat resistant resin since the plastic stuff is rather hot
[9:20:58] allyliciousx: don’t forget your interview Tyler
[9:21:15] frigginoasis: gg ghost and smoke to me at the back of the seat drivin lol

[9:21:59] daffodil86: ah gotcha Nem
[9:22:15] frigginoasis: *BIULDING
[9:22:22] NemisizZ: but think that type of resin might be pricy as fuck lol
[9:22:47] NemisizZ: so might just be as good to make it in normal resin, even that it gets fucked after a few casts
[9:22:54] frigginoasis: travpiDWicked
[9:22:55] NemisizZ: cuz it might be cheaper that way
[9:22:59] MadChemistTHC: made human slaves to mine gold
[9:23:05] daffodil86: yeah prob. I wonder what size the print bed is, would it be worth it
