[4:07:56] 420thMagicMan: The vision he has for Pegasus seems to only work for higher crime with a lot more profit than the current meth system @uberhaxornova
[4:08:00] pee_poopbutt: The moment Nino started doing bank and jobs your relationship changed - he’s no longer the big guy at the top, just another crim now

[4:08:24] BonesDG2: He’s more like a liaison trying to keep relations in tact between the meth labs and everything organised

[4:09:21] SpartanJack_: He is medium boss now mehdiBIZ
[4:09:22] Starmoor: Ken the ranch we gotta stop dr. Phil @cinnamontoastken
[4:09:23] MIKEBL0CK: @420thMagicMan i think his main goal for putting food on the table for Pegasus will eventually be loans, once that gets setup. then they'll be doing driving, protection, pushing, etc on the side
[4:09:23] FortTehZian: like venom snake or whatever
[4:09:24] Zhinj: @ReclaimedDragon Seems like hes already decided

[7:18:19] JungleG: @Actual_Nicotine right and for that to happen.... ding ding gotta have the rep go up aka 3rd lab = build rep faster
[7:18:21] kravnx: Grand Siz Cartel ofc
[7:18:27] epic_smee: @uberhaxornova question is if they want your strain or your recipe as well
[7:18:36] 3spada_Grande: Are you gonna stay masked up while cooking with RR people
[7:18:39] GhostBabyAlien8: Grand Sanora Cartel
[7:18:40] Actual_Nicotine: @JungleG I don't see how that invalidates anything I've said
[7:18:45] xcurryricex: uhnHm
[7:19:05] dreamwalker213: @epic_smee I mean they’re gonna be working together, obviously siz would want them to make the best product
[7:19:15] BolbiBaggins: @Shaqsaidno Grand Senora Cartel. Julio came up with it quickly off his mind when looking at the map to threaten Rob/Roflgator about being given meth
[7:19:29] JungleG: @Actual_Nicotine so then why did you even respond to my comment lol that what i said the firrst message

[7:20:00] Valaphar: need to make up the innovation costs at least
[7:20:07] eiightbiitt: key price
[7:20:10] Mr_Michel: Julio should be the face of GSC
[7:20:10] ka1o5: to be determined

[7:21:41] doctor_roast: "i want 100% of the profits and 20% of RR" uhnSiz
[7:21:43] Ultimatestrife: Nino doesn't understand, they need the 100% baseline, etc
[7:21:50] LijeBaley: Roosters Rest stocks in NFTs please :)
[7:21:50] syneesia: put a patent on the recipe if ever KEKW
[7:21:53] dreamwalker213: @epic_smee why would siz want them cooking his strain at shit quality, that wouldn’t make sense. This is the point of working together, everyone makes money
[7:21:56] blazinginferno24: 90/10 uhnEvil
[7:21:57] Mr_Michel: 10% and make Saab a full HOA member
[7:21:59] MsAutumnWind: Siz & Saab have put in so much more money to date so that will need to be recouped
[7:21:59] ka1o5: and it's 12k to start it off
[7:22:00] Veelox: The GSC rules the meth territory rooH
[7:22:19] Valaphar: KEKW he wants you to cook out of the goodwill in your heart
[7:22:22] syneesia: it took 3 days KEKW
[7:22:24] SERI0USB33F: so basically Nino doesn't want siz to  earn anythin, and he wants 100% profits? LUL

[7:22:28] Soffeli: KEKW
[7:22:29] Tweker: he expect for siz to sit in a lab for hours with 0 profit?
[7:22:34] Valaphar: KEKW he's scamming rofl
[7:22:35] Kyndagh: Sure, but they get more advantage out of that relationship KEKW
[7:22:36] BobRossSaladToss: moon2WUT

[7:23:06] LijeBaley: Just gotta sell Cooking Lessons  that you mentioned before peepoHappy
[7:23:07] Valaphar: @valorant_godlike if you havent figured out nino is on their boat KEKW
[7:23:08] MsAutumnWind: need to know what the meth goes for first Nino duh????? KEKW
[7:23:08] sirauron23: Lol nino wants the good shit but doesn’t want pay for it
[7:23:08] hihighmeh: lol
[7:23:12] Justin_Thyme: why are you guys ignoring the fact that them using his strain increases the value of his meth
[7:23:14] PoliteZombie: Helps cook, gets paid nothing KEKW
[7:23:16] Wiggly_Mew: it's a fee for your time
[7:23:19] Ceryshen: this meth business got really complicated LUL
[7:23:20] RezaQ8: I guess what he is saying that because the strains help each other there is no need for fees? im not entirely sure
[7:23:26] LijeBaley: Ratitouies Except that rat makes meth
[7:23:32] Swimmyb12: If everyone is using the same strain, and they're all generally selling at a flat rate, wouldn't Siz essentially have a monopoly as a cook?
[7:23:33] Actual_Nicotine: Imagine paying an expert for their time and expertise LUL
[7:23:35] massive_legend420: yea this meth stuff has gotten a lil spicy uhnS
[7:23:36] FavouritePho: KEKW no cut = they can spend 4 weeks and 100k on research
[7:23:37] LethalBro: A chef's salary NODDERS
[7:23:38] RabbitBro818: Nino wants to learn how to cook the meth themselves from siz and keep siz poor LUL
[7:23:39] Justin_Thyme: they don't even want his help
[7:23:46] Gooopycheese: chat wanted to work together and now its using siz PepeLaugh
[7:23:47] SERI0USB33F: nino takin notes LUL

[7:23:58] Tweker: @Justin_Thyme must be why hes here asking for it heh
[7:24:00] cryslik: nino talks in circles because he is effectively talking for 4 people...so has to be clear and consise
[7:24:03] epic_smee: @favouritepho u never know. they might hit the Jackpot with their recipe
[7:24:18] Justin_Thyme: @tweker he's asking for his strain so both meths go up in value together
[7:24:24] yrxaa: the nerds would love siz
[7:24:25] LijeBaley: @swimmyb12 More of the stuff was talked about before
[7:24:26] lil_lewie: @FavouritePho to be fair with the 12K batches theyve already spent like 60K in the past 4 days
[7:24:29] RaLee33: Nino has a point
[7:24:40] Actual_Nicotine: Just work for exposure DESKCHAN
[7:24:43] wondervviener: 3 days worth KEKW
[7:24:43] syneesia: @Justin_Thyme it's just not the strain its the process itself
[7:24:43] Hento: @cryslik thats just Nino tho lol
[7:24:44] CensoredTH0ughTs: siz should be compensated tho too
[7:24:45] epic_smee: i watched one methrun of them. and they are really organised. Was surprised
[7:24:55] dreamwalker213: @cryslik that’s the problem, Nino speaks as if he’s the leader when he’s not lol
[7:25:00] Justin_Thyme: @syneesia they don't even want him to participate in the process
[7:25:01] xcurryricex: LUL
[7:25:01] LazyLouis: Nino does something that all the Clean Bois do and that is called "Cum Stacking"
[7:25:02] massive_legend420: wake up early ez
[7:25:04] syneesia: EU Siz JamesPog
[7:25:04] massive_legend420: LOL
[7:25:08] cwilce: CB has spent like 100k already bc theyve been cooking  at 12k a batch
[7:25:08] Valaphar: siz, saab, manny and denzel should be compensated for their cost and time 100%
[7:25:09] DutchmastaS: Siz is the one who knocks

[7:25:29] wondervviener: EU Siz JamesPog Curtis and Flippy is back
[7:25:31] madpeppino: They just want free recipe
[7:25:31] FakeKoreanMan: EU SIZ JamesPog
[7:25:32] jewbacca37: @Valaphar their cost and time is being able to sell the meth at 2x or 3x the cost because of rep not going down
[7:25:33] GlitchBye: No sleep Siz
[7:25:37] Hento: what does time matter, it can be cooked whenever
[7:25:38] killercam22: the nerds are up at the same time as siz so i dont see a problem
[7:25:39] MsAutumnWind: it feels like Nino has taken on so much, maybe too much - they don't even have time to experiment with meth, they just want to throw down the lab & some workers and get it done
[7:25:40] sonic01tv: Au/Eu nova shift
[7:25:41] Drax_1X: uhnSiz  I want 20%, of Pegasus Kappa
[7:25:41] brujo_de_sal: @Dialapis or they will spoil the pot and end up even worse off than they are now.  Pissing off about 40  people with guns is kinda stupid.

[7:25:51] LijeBaley: Like a cookie clicker siz
[7:25:54] 3spada_Grande: Do they expect you to teach them the recipe
[7:25:55] Mr_Michel: this shiz turning into a real job
[7:25:56] syneesia: @Justin_Thyme they haven't figure out how to cook good batches anyway yet, so they might ask siz for it
[7:25:58] BlurryFace79: RIP Barry ridealongs LUL LUL
[7:25:59] lijgma: eu siz au sassy uhnGiga

[7:26:06] ka1o5: Or if Siz can nominate a person to copy his recipe.
[7:26:07] Valaphar: @jewbacca37 rep doesnt go down if CB does their own strain the rep gets split so the end buyer would be fucked
[7:26:07] Ceryshen: Siz going to wake up every day PogChamp
[7:26:07] DubiousDelirium: uhnHello uhnSun uhnKek

[7:26:30] massive_legend420: @valorant_godlike chill man
[7:26:30] RabbitBro818: Hmm
[7:26:34] Actual_Nicotine: @jewbacca37 by giving away their trade secret for nothing? Compensation makes sense
[7:26:36] Ultimatestrife: this is a logical question, but they need to understand there won't be 24/7 cookings
[7:26:37] Ceryshen: one more cook LUL
[7:26:39] syneesia: EU and NA Meth cook, AU Barry KEKW
[7:26:44] tally_one: Can’t operate their lab on your time? Just swap between each lab during cooldown s?
[7:26:46] LijeBaley: Yep need to schedule  NODDERS
[7:26:48] Justin_Thyme: @syneesia they haven't gotten results yet, but their 4th attempt was successful, which is super quick, and they've already been using strategies to get a ton of information out of their first batches
[7:26:51] SpiffyRuu: the rr is on late anyway
[7:26:53] Valaphar: @jewbacca37 2x 3x the price is speculation at this point without knowing the cap, CB is circumventing innovation costs and time to make a faster profit
[7:26:57] BolbiBaggins: @massive_legend420 that guy is major WeirdChamp
[7:26:58] leightones: @valorant_godlike you're still going huh
[7:26:58] lazy_boy: lang doesnt want the nerds to leave the server thats why he wants to get his off the ground
[7:27:07] jewbacca37: @Actual_Nicotine i'm not disagreeing fully on compensation but if the goal is to unite labs and pump out double product at high level then ur getting a fuck ton more money off that
[7:27:08] hekel: uhnCozy uhnCozy uhnCozy
[7:27:10] Gooopycheese: thats so wrong tho @MsAutumnWind
[7:27:15] MsAutumnWind: does meth weigh anything? storage going to be an issue as well
[7:27:16] ViktorStagnetti: @TallyTwo That would be a lot of in & out traffic at both labs.
[7:27:17] arcticpenguino: depends on the demand i guess
[7:27:22] arcticpenguino: and how fast you sell
[7:27:23] epic_smee: yeh. Lang wont be in the lab from what i understood
[7:27:23] LijeBaley: The big question is weekends
[7:27:29] imSammers: @lazy_boy wut
[7:27:40] LijeBaley: Amd scheduling
[7:27:41] Valaphar: @jewbacca37 uniting the labs is the fastest way for everyone to make money, CB isnt offering anything in return. Siz has said that since day 1
[7:27:45] lazy_boy: imSammers thats what he said
[7:27:45] MsAutumnWind: @teoshi_ how is it so wrong?
[7:27:45] ifeellikepac: teegri1Firstdayout1
[7:27:45] tally_one: @viktorstagnetti true also I think it would work since they want the nerds involved earlier
[7:27:49] Mr_Michel: maybe a day by day thing
[7:27:54] tally_one: Wouldnt*
[7:27:57] imSammers: @lazy_boy i mean... why don't they just cook then
[7:28:00] jewbacca37: @Valaphar they are offering an entire lab. how is that nothing
[7:28:06] lazy_boy: because they broke lol
[7:28:06] gingerrsss: @MsAutumnWind Because thats not whats happening
[7:28:08] ifeellikepac: taylor133OMG taylor133Blush taylor133Crazy
[7:28:11] Mr_Michel: one day for CB next for HOA
[7:28:17] brujo_de_sal: Jesus everyone just needs to get in the same bed already.
[7:28:18] CR3V3R: Heisensiz. I’m here for it.
[7:28:24] Hento: so you still gonna sell your shit, then get paid for CB batches?
[7:28:26] Landmayer_: @epic_smee they want the lab for the nerds, not for them, they will go there alone just to learn, nerds already wanted to dumb 200k to learn it
[7:28:30] franzuuu: take a flat fee in bags
[7:28:33] NEEEATT: @lazy_boy they literally have a second account they have money they can use
[7:28:34] imSammers: @lazy_boy lol ok.. i mean if they're gonna leave cuz they can't cook then... they're probably gonna leave anyways
[7:28:34] killercam22: @Valaphar its because its nino talking and being very cryptic
[7:28:35] Valaphar: @jewbacca37 offering their lab to siz makes them more money faster. In return they're giving nothing to siz. They're saving on insane costs and time
[7:28:36] SNunez3: Nino gonna get siz to pay for cooking at this point
[7:28:39] jewbacca37: @Valaphar cb is happy to cook on their own and learn the process but if everyone wants to max money then ya...
[7:28:47] Justin_Thyme: lang and donnie aren't desperate for this to happen, they've hesitantly extended this offer so I doubt they'd agree to much
[7:28:47] LITTLESLEEP: !paststreams

[7:28:51] KidChameleon_: @imSammers because siz is the one pushing for 1 single strain being sold?
[7:28:54] Widd: @valaphar cb is offering the 2nd lab for more money and doing all the distribution. What are you talking about
[7:28:54] LijeBaley: Yeah tomatoReally
[7:28:56] Thomarse: uhnEvil
[7:29:01] justinpickett: I'm new here,  who is which character?
[7:29:02] Ultimatestrife: uhnKek
[7:29:03] lazy_boy: he just wants them to have a good time its not htat serious
[7:29:07] nez42: @Valaphar cause if there is another strain, everyone loses? how is that not benefiting siz
[7:29:07] EyeoftheCuck: Oh gosh
[7:29:10] imSammers: @Kid_Chameleon_ no cuz lang is poor
[7:29:13] wondervviener: at this point, pegasus isn't needed for distribution when you have the Vagos KEKW
[7:29:13] unusedboot: @Justin_Thyme uhnMeta
[7:29:18] LijeBaley: @justinpickett Siz Nino Saab
[7:29:21] Gooopycheese: @MsAutumnWind i mean they initially wanted to cook their own so the nerds can learn on their own. now theyre thinking of working since its what everyone wants
[7:29:25] KidChameleon_: @imSammers uh.... ok
[7:29:37] Ultimatestrife: @lazy_boy no one is arguing against that
[7:29:43] vlICHAOSIlv: he is referring to like personal use drops @wondervviener
[7:29:43] Yokota777: At this point it’s best to just let them do whatever and just focus on your own operation. It’s gonna get to messy I feel.
[7:29:46] justinpickett: @lijebaley thank you, James and aleks are who?
[7:29:50] MetalGearJoe: I wish Siz would jus out wait CB until they’re broke and take over the 2nd lab
[7:29:51] dcoop365: No one is asking the question of if this doesn’t work out what does that mean for Pegasus distro, that’s leverage from the other side
[7:29:52] imSammers: @Kid_Chameleon_ i think maybe there is a miscommunication here idk
[7:29:55] SNunez3: Omg
[7:29:58] massive_legend420: need to think on this
[7:30:00] InvictoNZ: sounds like 2 seperate operations would be easier :p
[7:30:06] 80b101: @wondervviener Pegassus is needed because the master chef doesnt tied in the supply chain
[7:30:09] Mr_Michel: well thats why you suggested a flat rate for your cooking time
[7:30:11] nebneb717: That’s not fair at all lol
[7:30:13] ka1o5: -flat rate, the money part is all up to Nino
[7:30:14] bearrynice: he wants all the good lol
[7:30:16] AttanoZ: to many mouth to feed
[7:30:16] Devomatics: At some point it may be too many pieces moving
[7:30:17] Drax_1X: Now he's trying to get a piece of your lab
[7:30:19] justinpickett: did I do a bad
[7:30:19] xcurryricex: uhnHm
[7:30:23] Valaphar: @nez42 thats a neutral benefit they're not offering any incentives to siz and co besides the profits CB would make. I feel like nobody understands innovation costs&time as resources and compensating people properly KEKW
[7:30:25] YewFancy: A lot of money to be tied to separate groups

[7:33:03] Valaphar: @nez42 they're reluctant because instead of them doing the experimentation and sinking in time and money for whatever the amount they'd be saving on all that with bringing in siz to cook
[7:33:04] karrotkake0: yup
[7:33:09] tally_one: Alternative, Siz appoints  an EU cook he trusts with the recipe so they can have a 100% strain 2

[8:51:59] TheAmericanBaby: @murdoced everyone has unlimited tire replacement I believe
[8:52:01] FrozenSodaCan: @murdoced the tire repair kit can be reused until it runs out of durability
[8:52:04] leightones: 60?
[8:52:07] YewFancy: After a few batches*
[8:52:14] frostwhispertx: @YewFancy doesnt work like that. Its tied to the individual who activates the laptop

[8:52:22] jnrspesh_: but they were never told about the labs etc,
[8:52:32] Yokota777: @tolerance00 Teaching them to cook is a big no I feel. Siz has been super generous with info anyway.
[8:52:36] sirlongshlongg: does bayo stream?
[8:52:39] frostwhispertx: @YewFancy so the settings that are 100% for siz would not be settings that are 100% if Nino tried to make his own. Its unique

[8:54:28] jnrspesh_: and then youve divulged stuff to pegas so they can out flex in certain ways
[8:54:33] TheRarePotato: @tolerance00 seems like they already know the basics and Siz doesn't have to tell them what he's doing with the laptop tho
[8:54:40] Yokota777: @tolerance00 That’s exactly it. He’s essentially be/has been the work horse and once he’s all squeezed of energy he’ll be dumped like Flippy and Siz just mentioned.
[8:54:41] TheAmericanBaby: @elewiggle Siz owned it for the first few weeks. now more keys are being handed out to people

[8:55:30] Rooberz27: @sirlongshlongg Check the wiki for streamer names
[8:55:33] jnrspesh_: if you guys got to learn at 2k a po opposed to 12k like others thats odd tho isnt it
[8:55:36] RedWillowGaming: !tirepop
[8:55:38] xcrash283x: oh my god i just seen the clip of saab explaining that renos MOBO died and , that man doesnt know how to talk lol
[8:55:42] TheAmericanBaby: @elewiggle he knows there are 3 keys but doesn't know who has the 3rd key
[8:55:43] TheRarePotato: @frostwhispertx how reliable this info anyway? could be another jebait
[8:55:46] KingPresiden: @a_monkie, he didn't see so its still meta

[8:56:36] TheRarePotato: @frostwhispertx that's interesting then uhnHm
[8:56:36] Rooberz27: Why is chat extra smelly today
[8:56:39] xtrememayhem: the way i see it if speedy is doing it alone atm is that he may be trying to see what it takes to hit the ceiling with it to get the numbers then spread
[8:56:44] EleWiggle: It's perfect tho. EU = HOA and NA = CB/Pega
[8:56:51] xcrash283x: @Ntviiper hey viper, hope you had a good stream/time in the city
[8:56:58] BolbiBaggins: @a_monkie im assuming you're new to rp, i suggest you read the !meta command to better understand why what you said was meta
[8:57:02] Ntviiper: @jnrspesh_ its not odd at all lol things change money goes up and down just because they got a key doesnt mean someone should teach them it
[8:57:02] leightones: @rooberz27 meth
[8:57:08] frostwhispertx: @TheRarePotato but ofc 'In Rp' it probably makes sense for them to act paranoid about recipee anyway

[8:59:22] tolerance00: Maybe it's better for Siz to just sell the product to the gangs in bulk and in cash. Let the gangs do whatever they want to do with the meth.

[9:00:50] EleWiggle: hard to trust other gangs nowadays if you have alot reseaching from google
[9:00:50] aahleas: or rather not how much he trusts nino per se, but whether he can stay objective with the people hes running
[9:00:55] Voku: i feel like siz needs to just sit down with lang and talk to him about it
[9:00:58] ethan_4546: uhnKek
[9:01:00] Voku: and get his thoughts no?
[9:01:08] Snill_The_Undying: yeah, and what stop CB from stealing the formula after they learn it.

[9:01:25] Chillinit: leightones whos zb? sorry haha
[9:01:28] ShowHatez: yea, we need a lang+nino+don+siz meeting

[9:01:35] Minty_Squinty: nobody
[9:01:35] Rmehandru: lang doesnt even acknowledge siz. kinda weird how they expect full trust
[9:01:36] massive_legend420: never talk about zb lol
[9:01:40] frostwhispertx: Siz has shown trust but Denzel, Saab and Nino lied thier asses off to Buddha, Don and Tony so ofc they are a bit sus
[9:01:41] KingPresiden: @murdoced, fuck no
[9:01:52] aahleas: i think the only legit fear they have is whether u get bored/busted by bayo or someone for something
[9:01:57] Tru7hyDv8: at this point in time it's been a 1-way street with Siz supplying allot of info
[9:01:58] Actual_Nicotine: @Snill_The_Undying I don't think they can, because it's tied to the chef. Siz's recipe is his recipe alone, their 100% would be a different recipe as I understand it
[9:02:02] ka1o5: Shifty
[9:02:02] Nightbot: When the imposter is sus! 😳 uhnEvil
[9:02:03] EleWiggle: Think you already got Nino's good side
[9:02:11] 1TrueTyrant: I mean, you are asking them to put all their eggs in your basket, that requires a lot of goodwill
[9:02:12] ILLuminatexi: You only gave them basic info that they would find out when their first batch cures in a few days though no?
[9:02:14] sirauron23: I think cb is just tired of putting money into experimenting while they waste money on other shit so they just watch best shit sooner
[9:02:14] jnrspesh_: @massive_legend420 im open ffor the story either way tbh, but yes id rather the chaos of them learning
[9:02:21] EleWiggle: For relaying Meth Info before
[9:02:22] Olacarn: uhnPeep
[9:02:24] Rmehandru: nino was also making hella demands for price and quantity regulation when he has nothing to stand on but buddhas key

[9:02:36] Snill_The_Undying: @actual_nicotine they steal the formula then steal the key... start fresh and monopolize.
[9:02:39] shankapotomus22: bayo has been hard on the hunting lately
[9:02:40] ShowHatez: any researchers?
[9:02:41] TheRarePotato: well Saab lied to Nino earlier at least he said so

[9:03:06] okazi1shot: you give the info but i think they didn't get it anyways xD
[9:03:06] Tru7hyDv8: @1truetyrant the only egg they have is a lab key
[9:03:07] aahleas: yes but u cant blame denzel he has been quite hands off lately with siz
[9:03:09] Actual_Nicotine: @Snill_The_Undying I think you misunderstood. That physically cannot steal the recipe.
[9:03:11] Gibba223: If they end up with a perfect strain and then give the same offer to u to cook would you say yes?
[9:03:15] Voku: they have wow nerds who love numbers

[9:03:36] sirauron23: It’s hard to trust 3.0 nino lol

[9:05:12] Actual_Nicotine: @Snill_The_Undying now the aren't. Siz clicks 'start' on the laptop, this means it will be Siz's strain (high rep) they then cook it themselves, he's not going to show them purity, just offering to give them his high rep strain
[9:05:14] EleWiggle: rep means the bond between you and nino

[9:05:31] ILLuminatexi: @tru7hydv8 Ehh they have more eggs than that. They have two groups pegasus and cbs. If it came down to a competition with both 100% purity could siz and co win?

[9:06:32] Taemek: @UberHaxorNova I just dont think in its current state, its designed to be distributed to players yet. The mechanic behind it just looks like its a grind for locals only to recoup costs of experimenting for now or at least trying to recoup costs.
[9:06:32] aahleas: have u had a batch ready after the 12k change per cook? @UberHaxorNova
[9:06:33] TheAmericanBaby: @uberhaxornova I think what he is trying to ask is "Why are you building more trust with Nino? and Why would Nino ruin his relationship with Siz trust wise or backstabbing wise?"
[9:06:35] 80b101: 1k per bag JamesPog
[9:06:37] JoeyGBones: Lang and Siz should meet up alone. Leaders of both their own op. Nino takes the lead a lot but doesn’t want to seemingly.
[9:06:38] 1TrueTyrant: The real problem was never money for CB, it was the RP, Lang would rather be a broke bitch over losing RP for the crew
[9:06:45] azure__comet: @UberHaxorNova Do you think Siz might start depending on the HoA Meth Team vs his OG team more in the future?
