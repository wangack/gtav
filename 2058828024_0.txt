[1:32:36] HandofOdd: Not even two hours in lol
[1:32:39] kimbercs: @drokoh yea right!
[1:32:43] DaveShadows: are the windows bullet proof in these trucks?

[1:33:11] Praskle: feel you, could care less, but still would like the know wtf is going on lol
[1:33:14] shellfiee: butcoin is mainly for crime so might as well go full crim gang
[1:33:15] khanoute: Raia and Clay were pissed about that, they wanted to double coins production for a while, Jason agreed but then he focused on money instead
[1:33:16] Madknightwolf: The problem is he asked you to call OTT. I think if he wants to figure something our he should call himself
[1:33:17] printerman22: need code names for everyone too
[1:33:18] soniclink10: Chain gangs strength is they all just listen to the boss
[1:33:22] thricerice1: using coins to double the coins is the ideal move tbh
[1:33:26] willowompoo: yeah if hes wrong thats on him
[1:33:26] azncheesy: Role as he is the boss
[1:33:33] bigtex494: Everyone should have input tho

[1:33:44] 42arc: @khanoute they couldn't get into the house
[1:33:44] khanoute: @Madknightwolf He's burned with OTT, like Raia is, he doesn't want to deal with the Company
[1:33:47] shellfiee: make raia the igl i wanna see chaos
[1:33:48] xNeixen: i vote GIGACHAD Talon for IGL
[1:33:49] kurrekurban: I think a notebook in the house where you can write things down would be great
[1:33:51] flyyingakuma: its fun for content.
[1:33:56] PubliqueEnemy: well he has to start talking to other ppl out of ur group if he will be the igl
[1:33:57] Frostring: if anything you guys should sell your excess coins because they will be worth a lot less soon
[1:33:57] willowompoo: BatChest
[1:33:58] drdlpshlllt: Just need to make sure you're all on the same page.
[1:34:00] HandofOdd: Up against the wall classic
[1:34:07] auxfrog: macro and micro
[1:34:07] Moka3321: @bigtex494 input goes before execution not during it

[1:34:25] Yoi_97: whats igl
[1:34:31] miguelonmp2: @pineapplegladiator yeah
[1:34:31] thricerice1: coins is not worthless you need minimum 50 butc to do a heist
[1:34:32] drokoh: true but a leader has to prove their worth
[1:34:32] drdlpshlllt: Better to fail as a team
[1:34:33] ekahS_: @Yoi_97 in game leader
[1:34:33] ZitroneSimo: I mean Jason doesn’t always makes the right calls, he could’ve tried spending money a long time ago to up coin production but he was just hoarding the money
[1:34:34] Madknightwolf: @khanoute figured they would be good after he bought ott breast milk lol

[1:34:56] jjortiga: APEX
[1:34:57] PrettyKrazy: jason talks big but when it hits the fan he'll just run away classic
[1:34:59] 42arc: imo you should always sell coins if you don't spend them and there's a massive surge in demand like when new bps dropped, could have earned 400-500k that day
[1:35:03] chapszz: We love apex
[1:35:03] willowompoo: yall need to contest his calls too in a healthy way

[1:35:37] Kenjack1984: yeah clayton and raia told him to ramp up but he didnt
[1:35:37] qihk: if jason said 6.5 for 30k circuit boards, 190k. Everyone puts down 20k and he pays the rest

[1:36:11] emrhys95: i nominate raia as leader
[1:36:14] hghwalk: Your hair so sleek!
[1:36:22] PrettyKrazy: igl logic is 5 ppl doing a shitty plan is better than 3 ppl doing a good plan and 2 people not with them 5Head
[1:36:24] maikkekku: PogO
[1:36:26] chaosunleashed999: If you could only play one game for the rest of your life between GTA and Apex what would you pick?
[1:36:27] qihk: True raia is great
[1:36:27] bigtex494: Like football, film room, and then game day
[1:36:31] counttolstoy: vee is the leader

[1:36:45] maikkekku: Just let eugene take the charge GIGACHAD
[1:36:46] PrettyKrazy: jay coulda but..
[1:36:47] BananasOP89: Raia for sure, she has been always right about stuff, Jason has always been wrong
[1:36:47] LeBrozoJM: lol
[1:36:50] Slaydess7: the problem is when Eugene and Jason will be together
[1:36:51] Rockhound__97: LUL
[1:36:53] 42arc: clay is the brain, aparently. nick is not smart KEKW
[1:36:53] qihk: Raia did great yesterday
[1:36:56] PrettyKrazy: maybe tolan could take some lead
[1:36:56] Beltano: @Acie what role would you do when doing crimes? more in the background or right in the hacking stuff etc?
[1:36:56] kablard: @dailymods_ He's still by far the best option to lead this gang and it's not even debatable.
[1:36:58] AFFABLE__: I am confused why do only 2 racks have 6060s? You got tons of mats over the last two weeks shouldnt all the racks be 6060 by now? Something is fishy Susge
[1:36:59] maikkekku: @BananasOP89 COPIUM

[1:37:06] Tibs97: Jammies
[1:37:11] Kenjack1984: clayton should be in charge of computer stuff imo but he is not around enough due to train ticket
[1:37:13] drokoh: clay lowkey should be leader
[1:37:18] kimbercs: Jason can be your sidekick
[1:37:20] AlexNattes: Sure
[1:37:22] Kingoftherandos: What's Vee's role in civ gang?
[1:37:24] Faisallu: try the ac hack then
[1:37:24] shellfiee: there should be an igl but having the soy boy in the group do it is gonna be interesting
[1:37:24] Mr_Tvi: They just need to give you a gun
[1:37:24] BananasOP89: @BananasOP89 fine, give examples how i am wrong
[1:37:27] megasoy: Clueless

[1:37:30] Madknightwolf: I think it would be good if yall became sub division of hydra. Yall seem tight with them.  Yall could join some jobs and do runs to clean money.
[1:37:30] willowompoo: @emrhys95 eugene prioritizes fun over progression nmpKEK
[1:37:30] girlballor: nora is definitely the hacker

[1:37:41] hghwalk: I gotta see typing hacks im curious
[1:37:42] x_amer__: u should try AC hack
[1:37:44] thricerice1: yuno said that 6060 is not worth it so Jason didn't make them but with the power bill 6060 is needed to lessens the bills
[1:37:52] Nulltiply: getaway driver
[1:37:53] 42arc: LUL
[1:37:53] AlexNattes: Maybe a training hacking arc with Yuno could help

[2:38:13] HoldMyGrenade: grouping sex lol
[2:38:18] flyyingakuma: how is it state owned. so dubious
[2:38:32] blackdoos: thats the issue, it should not be state owned
[2:38:48] LazyMike: TURE

[2:40:10] miihxh: i mean problem is if they get caught they dont lose g6 job. no downside to rob
[2:40:16] vazeline__: No one player should have that much power over another. if someone gets convicted they should be fired.
[2:40:18] kippuss: you can record proof on camera etc
[2:40:20] ruinmylifepls: he cany
[2:40:23] infmeister: he can, cops cant

[2:40:29] flyyingakuma: he can if he recognizes
[2:40:32] batute97: He can, the police cant
[2:40:33] guzeriz: you can voice ID
[2:40:35] Kraenit: jason would be terrible at it, but what he says makes sense
[2:40:36] DylBKR: You cant recognise through voice
[2:40:37] Slaydess7: yes you can voice id, voice id is forbidden just for judicial case
[2:40:38] dannydoesschool: u can report to police no?
[2:40:39] spartymarty: cops cant
[2:40:39] AgadhiTheGreat: Civs can voice ID, police cant
[2:40:43] M0hkofantti: Not legally if the job would be changed whitelisted
[2:40:46] ALXD_: I think Voice ID is up to the player idk
[2:40:46] np7092: LOL
[2:40:47] Nulltiply: Rob him right now
[2:40:49] Mr_Tvi: You just can voice id as a cop as RS
[2:40:52] willowompoo: NotLikeThis
[2:40:53] guzeriz: thats why mot people use voice changers or make up diffrent voice, you can voice ID
[2:41:05] blackdoos: you can, but its no proof
[2:41:07] sazogrim: Unhinged
[2:41:09] M0hkofantti: Its not legally valid
[2:41:09] soniclink10: You can buy it won't hold up in court
[2:41:09] PrettyKrazy: this thing called evidence
[2:41:09] Abx0r: voice id doesn't hold up in a court of law
[2:41:10] KimJongKite: you can but cops cant go based on that
[2:41:10] vmjama: civs crims can voice ID others. Its only not admissible in court
[2:41:10] spartymarty: yes but they cant charge
[2:41:12] Slaydess7: even the cops can voice id, they just can't make a case out of it
[2:41:13] soniclink10: But
[2:41:15] donbena_: @dannydoesschool but voice id is not evidence for cops. They can't do anything with it
[2:41:15] evkay: Nunu in her own world lol
[2:41:16] Supersamss: find out in rp :)
[2:41:19] h0lk1: crims can voice id i think, police cant use it in court or to arrest someone. I thinkl
[2:41:21] guzeriz: you can, but you dont know "for sure"
[2:41:27] a_quail: cops cant use it as evidence, crims can do whatever
[2:41:34] Yoi_97: that's why Jason idea is bad
[2:41:38] willowompoo: -1 he wasnt, buddy black was
[2:41:40] guzeriz: @a_quail they can voice ID too
[2:41:41] DylBKR: -1 Nicholas
[2:41:42] danialdiego_: just do no masks when working g6 as a policy
[2:41:52] SaltiBanana: if an employer thinks its possible they did it they can still fire im pretty sure
[2:41:52] BorealisLumina: people get caught for example
[2:41:55] HELharti: it's only when cops pursue charges that it doesn't stick. other situations voice ID is alright. like your character could  choose to not trust someone that robs Vee based on voice ID
[2:42:03] blackdoos: you can't always fire them, but if the robbery goes wrong, they can identify the person and fire them
[2:42:04] soniclink10: G6 will always be state run
[2:42:07] Abx0r: put together a private security company business plan
[2:42:08] BorealisLumina: people get caught and still can work at G6
[2:42:10] guzeriz: @a_quail no where in nopixel rules say cops cant voice ID nor in cops SOPs , vader talked about it fw days ago police cna voice ID
[2:42:10] Slaydess7: you can't fire people, that's the whole problem
[2:42:11] PrettyKrazy: cops made a mandate recently, no mask on state property
[2:42:13] ArtemisRost: Nick is talking about whitelisting G6
[2:42:15] Pr0phetOG: Join in the RP conversation and ask them those questions :)
[2:42:19] flyyingakuma: daniel cant give everythinng
[2:42:20] PrettyKrazy: last night, idk when its official
[2:42:26] auxfrog: they need someone like Alex who can actually fire people
[2:42:29] Kraenit: it is
[2:42:34] h0lk1: G6 will never be whitelisted
[2:42:37] infin8cosmo: police can fire people
[2:42:39] theace8869: Picking 2 people because people can be bought
[2:42:41] khanoute: Whitelisting was a massive issue in 3.0 that's why they removed it in 4.0
[2:42:42] sunohonmy: the PD does it
[2:42:45] UrClassicDerp: this would never get enforced
[2:42:47] SaltiBanana: well its like irl managers make those choices
[2:42:52] blackdoos: its the same for the police, they can also fine or fire people
[2:42:53] k_enix: it is but it’s good for RP
[2:42:54] e0lvin: talk to them don't talk to us nmpLUL
[2:42:58] auxfrog: not if they take it seriously. there would be issues but it would probably be for the best
[2:43:00] rxratatat: the 2 people who lterally made SOP's and ideas to make g6 better? Yes
[2:43:09] khanoute: They don't want owners who are all powerful and form their cliques/groups
[2:43:21] blackdoos: people need consequences in order to make it fun
[2:43:21] a_quail: @guzeriz they can use it along with other evidence but they can't use just a voice to convict
[2:43:26] M0hkofantti: They could make G6 like soft PD
[2:43:26] topmiddle: you could talk to them
[2:43:31] emrhys95: jay zawn absolutely cannot have any authority over anyone kekw
[2:43:32] Hollowshaun: actually it would be o c c c c c c drama
[2:43:33] Rockhound__97: Conflict with meta, calling out someone with a mask just cause they know who it is.
[2:43:37] 0livesleft: Robbing people always invites ooc drama
[2:43:48] Hollowshaun: This meeting could have been a email

[2:45:32] InfiniteLimitX: He chats so much wham ICANT
[2:45:53] khanoute: @donbena_ Except it always happens, that's why RP has more drama than other sections. Fanbases get weaponized. Wait until gang wars start and every single chat will get toxic fast, streamers start malding.
[2:45:54] Beltano: @Buffalohed i see
[2:45:58] druedrue: Kreygasm
[2:46:04] iHarsh29: Cruton awake Pog

He even told you that. He KNOWS a lot. Why is he collecting all this info on everyone? Its critical thinking to put everything together to see he wants info to use as he see's fit. That overall is sus. So just be careful what you tell him. Cause he could "sell that info" to the highest bidder.

[5:46:40] HotRod0_0: Nunu prolly needs a blood donor, look it up there
[5:46:42] Arwoooo: You cannot contract HIV from a mosquito bite. HIV is a fragile virus that cannot survive for long outside of the human body, and mosquitoes do not transmit HIV.
[5:46:46] suddenreign: cause they need to do an antigen test, and unless theyre using your blood for donations, they have no need to know that
[5:47:01] hillaryclinton_xo: fruit flies are annoying
[5:47:09] BoredMarcus: doesn't really matter, in an emergency doctors will always test, whatever you say you have, just to be sure

[5:48:19] j_pandy: like the first time i donated blood they gave me a card with my blood type on it
[5:48:22] ekahS_: @tryhaaardau it's irrelevant for plasma they told me
[5:48:25] theRealESweezy: I had a really nice 4 foot tall yucca and they laid all their eggs and stole soil nutrients so it died Sadge
[5:48:28] suddenreign: @ekahS_ sounds like you do it regularly, maybe they have you on file
[5:48:31] Arwoooo: We get these tiny asshole flies in the UK in the summer when they work in fields.. they are the worse - I bought a new monitor and loads of them crawled inside and died on the screen so it looks like 20 dead pixles ):

[9:54:33] pineapplegladiator: But chat remember the gas and car repairs
[9:54:35] Mr_Tvi: Is 122 a bottle good?
[9:54:40] AleksaMLG: Routing wise, it's hard to track 20 bottles to plan the best route
[9:54:41] Bashxo: u sell rolls for .9?
[9:54:41] MALiiBU__: Watcha eating
[9:54:44] pineapplegladiator: so porbably like 1.5k clean money
[9:54:45] shivang1497: how much time does getting the materials for moonshine take though
[9:54:45] Dysotopia: cost of gas and wear and tear as clayton wasn't focused :)
[9:54:49] Tenivir: i mean knowing the spots and where to go etc would come with doing it
[9:55:02] Joao_from_Portugal: It means you could be more efficient
[9:55:03] Tenivir: i think it seems pretty decent
[9:55:05] CRlCK: actually i want it back on
[9:55:07] PezeM: - fuel - car repairs
