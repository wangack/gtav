[0:37:55] Finikith: HAHAHA
[0:37:55] CHEF_SLAYBOSS: Yep
[0:37:57] LW88: using AI for creative stuff is only going to happen for a few years. once studio execs make a few movies that bomb with AI scripts, they'll stop.

[0:38:42] CrimsonCarnotaurus: @shadowaurorix it's not just Facebook coming for you, all of them you're signed to past and present have you
[0:38:45] Sudz___: Do you think it will be like CGI where its obviously soulless and people will be turned off and bored by it?
[0:38:46] call_me_daddy614: I program AI
[0:38:53] Finikith: didn't the CEO of ghibli said it was like an insult to real life or something?
[0:38:56] LW88: it's the same inside baseball stuff cryptobros do
[0:38:57] thelifeofjorja: people spend so much time on actual art and now it‚Äôs just so easy for losers to claim robot art
[0:38:59] Priest55: Like a crypto bro basically
[0:38:59] CHEF_SLAYBOSS: No turning it off now
[0:39:11] xxDentwitchxx: Like that youtuber that use to make ai content
[0:39:11] rsyncd: The term AI is overused and misrepresented.... most of it is still just ML ---> Machine Learning
[0:39:21] joeygg1: @Finikith yeahh he did, hates when any any of his work is used with AI to make something
[0:39:22] nicholasbikolas: hopefully AI used to help diagnose people could be cool

[0:39:31] wittysquid1: people will always find ways to nerd out about something tho
[0:39:34] xxDentwitchxx: Hahahaha
[0:39:34] shadowless_warrior: It's going in the art/img/video bc it's way easier to place pixels on a screen then making automation specific AI. And investors and dumb ppl eat that the fuck up. @crayator
[0:39:35] DarkGreatBlade: I really like AI because it alows us to collect and interpret  a lot of data collection which we would be unable to do otherwise because it takes to much time
[0:39:52] joeygg1: thats the good side of AI
[0:39:56] CHEF_SLAYBOSS: Chatgpt does my job. Not long till I get caught LUL

[0:40:08] the_gee_cee: menial tasks
[0:40:10] JoannaWoodArt: people putting in specifics peoples art and taking their style/ work is painful
[0:40:13] sooparadox: i just live
[0:40:14] gr__04: what do you think about the music AI??
[0:40:16] lprampage: Yea I got that alot. I work in IT and there's mostly just oversaturated hype with it.   There is a major difference between AI and automation.
[0:40:20] JoannaWoodArt: so true
[0:40:23] joeygg1: the fucking voice actor stuff and shit is fuckedd
[0:40:27] wittysquid1: what are the bad parts tho?
[0:40:27] ErnieSKZ: like some can use AI to write their essays
[0:40:28] shadowless_warrior: That's the road AI has to take instead of useless img/video generation
[0:40:29] rsyncd: I'd still just call it MACHINE LEARNING (ML) not AI just yet Shruge
[0:40:30] CBakerTM: mmm
[0:40:31] legowarrior18: there are good bits of ai but a ton of bad parts
[0:40:33] VioIe: @Crayator did u watch charlies video about sora?
[0:40:40] mellonhead97: AI has so much potential but like are we going to focus our collective efforts on the good ways to use it or to make money
[0:40:40] eurekaproject: COULD BE SURE YEAH
[0:40:45] CHEF_SLAYBOSS: Humans are redundant
[0:40:57] ausbubbles: artist are losing their jobs for the same reason
[0:40:59] thatmetalhead9000: thats shitty
[0:40:59] Sudz___: call centers

[0:41:13] ausbubbles: WOAH BIG WORDS
[0:41:15] JoannaWoodArt: omg big word
[0:41:15] SeanCain_98: I think AI should be only for the people who need help with stuff like I have a learning disability and I would use it to help me with irl stuff and I‚Äôm thinking about it.

[0:41:21] Nightbot: Pog Clap
[0:41:23] aye_its_alex_14: PeepoClap big words
[0:41:24] gr__04: I feel like there‚Äôs no point in me finishing my trade because a robot will take over
[0:41:24] legowarrior18: who runs this ai shit
[0:41:29] NosAU: you can make fake drone footage perfectly usable as any stock footage for advertising
[0:41:29] LW88: 'its the future' etc.
[0:41:34] CBakerTM: mmmm
[0:41:42] dat_b0i_augi: That's crazy
[0:41:47] mellonhead97: I think in the long run it'll be great for humanity and relying on machines more is always what we do and allows us to focus on other things, but it's going to be a really rough transitional period

[0:41:57] ErnieSKZ: AI would be good to get some brainstorming ideas
[0:41:58] ImUncleLou: In the end, it's a double-edged sword
[0:42:00] JoannaWoodArt: the deep fakes of people are only gonna get worse too
[0:42:03] xxDentwitchxx: I saw in my family's members job in South Carolina is losing jobs to a robots in job some of them are having less hours of work and idk

[0:43:01] ausbubbles: this might be AI idk chat
[0:43:03] Highpo_: using AI to create art is different than AI creating art

[0:43:08] Perrilox: im pretty sure its AI dont be fooled hes programmed to say that
[0:43:13] NosAU: hes a fy=uck head
[0:43:14] shadowless_warrior: U seen the ai minecraft video?
[0:43:15] morbidfixation: Idk.. that‚Äôs what an AI would say.
[0:43:16] General_Cheesebasket: how can we believe you? maybe this stream was generated by AI
[0:43:17] NosAU: Hmm
[0:43:19] gr__04: I used Snapchat ai for my tafe assignments
[0:43:20] aye_its_alex_14: Aren't we all AI Hmm
[0:43:21] xxDentwitchxx: Oh ya true tho
[0:43:22] mellonhead97: MrDestructoid i'm also not ai, i'm a real viewer

[0:43:37] xxDentwitchxx: Yep
[0:43:40] thatmetalhead9000: yep
[0:43:44] nicholasbikolas: do you think there is an artistic element to a twitch career/youtube
[0:43:46] NosAU: (error) MrDestructoid
[0:43:55] Highpo_: its never the same it misses the humanity of it
[0:44:01] SeanCain_98: I think Al should only be for people with learning disabilities to help them doing irl stuff and I have learning disabilities
[0:44:02] Finikith: NODDERS
[0:44:18] DarkGreatBlade: i think using ai to replace things in the arts that take skill is morally wrong, but its great for the advancement of society in jobs and menial data interpretation
[0:44:21] aye_its_alex_14: Yeah that's cool
[0:44:22] xxDentwitchxx: Yes
[0:44:24] ariana9004: its just when ppl abuse it
[0:44:27] mellonhead97: MrDestructoid i agree streamer

[0:44:32] NosAU: (chatbot payment declined) please renew your subscription @Crayator MrDestructoid
[0:44:42] lprampage: The security aspect is a horrible nightmare atm regarding AI
[0:44:43] the_gee_cee: needs to be regulated properly
[0:44:43] LW88: I can see it being used for prompts, like instead of sketching your idea to give to an artist for a commission, you use AI to show them what you want.
[0:44:45] ariana9004: Yo fini
[0:44:47] Highpo_: AI is great but it will never be as great as human talent
[0:44:51] im_flaky: co founder of dream works thinks ai is gonna replace 8p% of peoples job in animation
[0:44:55] bboi1342: Fruitttyyyyy
[0:44:56] General_Cheesebasket: as with every scientific innovation, there are always positive practical applications but equivalently there are plenty of bad ways to use them as well
[0:45:00] shadowless_warrior: @crimsoncarnotaurus they already did and it became racist, homophobic and other things. Then it was reset and is now accompanied by another creator on stream. So both the creator and the ai itself are talking on stream.
[0:45:03] General_Cheesebasket: how do we decide when the bad outweighs the good?
[0:45:18] Goherotv: ALO hey cray, how ya going?
[0:45:25] VioIe: Hmm

[0:46:06] pizzang0: Why are we talking about AI?
[0:46:11] thatmetalhead9000: fax
[0:46:17] pizzang0: What started this conversation
[0:46:18] lprampage: Laws will never catch up with tech. Never has, never will.
[0:46:22] modzilad: I don't think that's morally wrong tbh, I think it's wrong because our laws and society hasn't keep up with how fast AI has been growing. We need to keep up first.
[0:46:23] Highpo_: @General_Cheesebasket you dont its up to people individually people are always going to missus tools they have access too
[0:46:26] ariana9004: KEKW
[0:46:29] xxDentwitchxx: Is bazz joining or no

[0:46:36] aye_its_alex_14: Just a lil rant
[0:46:37] xmagicalmegx: not to mention ai has been called out for stealing art - remaking things it already knows and someone else (a human) created
[0:46:37] the_gee_cee: crayPLS
[0:46:38] nicholasbikolas: the aus government is so behind on everything i wouldnt expect shit soon
[0:46:38] Neltrok: Good luck getting into helldivers
[0:46:41] gr__04: what‚Äôs the weather like in Melbourne today
[0:47:01] rsyncd: Universities here in Australia already use tools to detect AI assisted submissions and warn students to revise mhm It's not as seamless and good as many may thing mhm
[0:47:05] NosAU: you have to wait for something to go wrong before someone does something about
[0:47:08] eurekaproject: create an ai to keep up with it
[0:47:08] DarkGreatBlade: ai has already made itself such a staple in the common workspace that its going to be hard to get international laws to find where the line is
[0:47:11] thatmetalhead9000: YEP
[0:47:12] modzilad: yeah that's a good point
[0:47:13] Nightbot: Want more Cray in your Day? Check out YouTube: youtube.com/user/crayator

[0:47:51] shadowless_warrior: Cray the biggest problem is EVEN IF they pass laws against ai. That only slows down the progress there and not in China if they don't put regulations
[0:47:52] Highpo_: watching the senate is like a episode of SNL
