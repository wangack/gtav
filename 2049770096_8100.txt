[9:09:42] shinobuemon: Darn yuno should keep all the computer sales even though he's using btc from the group
[9:09:42] Pdmac779: it’s def something to talk about at the meeting today
[9:09:43] PsychoSheepp: I don’t see the difference in chopping cars or doing grime. you’re doing it all yourself from start to finish so the money is yours.
[9:09:44] Lazzy_419: it’ll get worked out
[9:09:47] sanasdome: I've been satythat you should be putting this money in your bank. But since it goes in the vault, it is group money rather than money you made from chopping, or G6 bags.
[9:09:49] RobLeezy810: I think it's just not how the crime has worked for them. They grind crime for rep not money
[9:09:53] kuwwoo: @Pdmac779 nodd
[9:09:54] iamthewitchergeralt: I dont think tony gets it from their standpoint LUL
[9:09:55] DrBakaDO: one thing I can see them saying is if you’re using the radar in the house that speedy approved octo buying yesterday with treasury money because he assumed the money was going back to the group
[9:10:00] bigpredictable: This senario is like that math question "if someone steals 100 bucks from a store, buys m70 bucks in product and gets 30 dollars chamge how much does the store lose"
[9:10:02] Gotgold: spice is good

[9:11:55] not_kotleta: oop g6 truck KEKW
[9:11:56] kentripp: it is, i think speedy is thinking you're doing group licks for you instead of the group and that only civ money can be for yourself. but if you're grinding money not using company resources to get your money up, thats separate
