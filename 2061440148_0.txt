[0:46:30] TSI1VORTEX: what is the discord for the server ?
[0:46:37] nmussa: !np
[0:46:37] StreamElements: I'm currently playing on a whitelisted GTA V RP server called NoPixel using the FiveM client ( https://fivem.net ). If you're interested in joining, visit https://nopixel.net to apply. To answer a few questions, you do NOT need to be a streamer to play on NoPixel. You will very likely have to wait a fair amount of time to receive a response to your application given the recent influx of people interested in playing.
[0:46:44] nmussa: It should be on their website
