[2:04:59] Bauldyr: Morrowinds quest stuff is like, exactly what I'd think I want, and then I'd play it and be like BuhhM
[2:04:59] SailorWS: Bussin
[2:05:01] ArtiKWasArtiX: I feel like morrowind is much more of a product of its time, but for its time it WAS extremely impressive and well made
[2:05:03] roagrr: crunchhh

[2:05:16] FoulVowl: Remember wandering the north coast trying to figure out what a cairn is?
[2:05:19] TitaniumTurtle9: I like how Bussing is the crunchy music emote
[2:05:23] Ryuko95: @SkadenAnimos Grant if you actually want to beat the story, raptor for a challenge
[2:05:25] brooksie359: Tried to play morrowind and then realized you can hit something and miss so I quit right away
[2:05:26] VolenoVehro: @BatAtVideoGames That Tales of Phantasia intro really was a strong start. I don't even remember what happens after that town.
[2:05:27] TitaniumTurtle9: MINORSPELLINGMISTAKE
[2:05:32] Shorkaa: yeah that one just hasnt aged as well
[2:05:39] F7Rhyx: I spent more time on installing mods than playing the game
[2:05:43] SailorWS: thats me with retro games tbh
[2:05:45] randomsama613: I'm about 30 mods deep and it still doesn't want to behave Sadge
[2:05:46] Ryuko95: @billasensei peepoStare
[2:05:52] Shorkaa: its not like there are no other things to play
[2:05:52] BatAtVideoGames: @VolenoVehro yea you get it. The combat system is cool for SNES and intro is so strong but fuck does it drag slooowly after
[2:05:53] BlazingSaddleSores: imagine if they had just made, like, morrowind 2 instead of fucking Starfield Life
[2:05:55] rnAlsation: Morrowind is a game I want to hit like it's new again.

[2:06:18] retrogamer_Leo: I still dont know what a Cairn is, something to do with dead or spirits is my best guess.
[2:06:20] TrustedHuman: @BlazingSaddleSores Life if only
[2:06:21] VolenoVehro: @BatAtVideoGames I'm very happy the series improved on story after that, cuz I love that battle system so much. It's evolved a ton now.
[2:06:27] SkadenAnimos: @Ryuko95 I remember just getting lost in the Grant boating part. Over and over.
[2:06:29] AkameOda: Makes sense
[2:06:30] SEVENTH_RAIDER: Soul trap permanent spell glitch was so fun though best bug
[2:06:36] ChibiDeviChaosCH: yeh the handholding like from rockstar is annoying

[2:41:21] stonedmikey: if you look at the stairs it seems like the basement is missing tbh
[2:41:22] lunorx6: the house look unfinish tho
[2:41:23] ProSpeakman: 5M is telling you to never close GTA obv
[2:41:25] BondTheFifth: Only thing I can think of is massive memory leak in FiveM
[2:41:29] Jakxtra: at least 2 take it or leave it
[2:41:30] Xernique: did you hear buddha calling you his favourite new RPer in 4.0?
[2:41:31] jfelisario: yeah ur the only one ive seen crash out when you close 5M
[2:41:32] jlopez011: imagine new houses right after lang bought the house
[2:41:35] Oscar_thegroucho: In editing mode, Buddha and Cousin saw the staircase spirals multiple levels down
[2:41:37] slumvillager: interior looked like an end-of-Friday job
[2:41:41] petepasco: DEV KOIL, can prob fix it
[2:41:42] story_nerd: judging by the scuffed ac unit it looks like that house interior is not finished
[2:41:44] Ogichihollow: cath4L cath4L cath4L
[2:41:53] terceroblue: it did look like it was randomly generated instead of any thought to the design
[2:42:11] Shad0w_wizard: I thought that house had a garage?
[2:42:15] serfdomKing: I think people are getting back into the game good luck
[2:42:19] Shad0w_wizard: car garage*
[2:42:30] PvtJet: may literally just be bugged
[2:42:31] Valagore: i think they just posistioned the stairs that way. only one size stairs i bet
[2:42:33] YasithSC: ground also clipping in a corner ,I don't think it's finished
[2:42:34] smirken: cant wait for the youtube comments, "buddha abuses ownership to get op house" lol
[2:42:35] rastabeast007: That staircase Def leads to a basement forreal
[2:42:35] JessCee7: The view is cool tho

[2:42:52] DavidGreenz: Favorite Pizza
[2:42:53] izzygus333: nah ive seen mutiple people have the same problem
[2:42:53] lunorx6: you need to close it yep
[2:43:02] itszark0: Maybe your FiveM is scuffed
[2:43:08] stonedmikey: @izzygus333 yeahh both buddha and wolfabelle
[2:43:10] absurdasparagus: what conflict even would cause that?
[2:43:13] nikothelame: Bucklington always has the crash issue
[2:43:17] izzygus333: @stonedmikey nodd
[2:43:18] dayvidd: Tobii or Nikez would probably be the best people to ask about the 5M scuff if you talk to either
[2:43:27] sarahmarbies: the staircase is just the default size you can’t make it any bigger or smaller so for most houses it continues into the floors
[2:43:34] seantropolis: geegaPray

[2:44:30] Xernique: Surely...
[2:44:38] Sir_Gibbon: too bad the balcony is not accessible
[2:44:42] xSabozZ: nice park in the front of the house for yuno to play
[2:44:44] Oscar_thegroucho: But the stairs don't go up either, so why even have the default spiral stairs?
