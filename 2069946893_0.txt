[3:10:00] baxsm: na wave is not kind to sly
[3:10:02] tony102804: Fiona time

[3:10:14] SpikeTrees: YEP
[3:10:28] acm_509: get a better brain
[3:10:29] submarinesix: It's UK brain bro it's so unfair
[3:10:30] GeneralPearTree: OMEGALUL RP esports people asking to use autoclickers
[3:10:31] HeroicVillain1: Maybe ui-r before next one
[3:10:31] psyduckmd: I knew the heist isnt even available yet LUL
[3:10:33] sellamsaber: I think they need to keep reloging
[3:10:34] Magzzy: @Ray__C  one of CG boys was 10 seconds ahead of timer he got it before everyone
[3:10:37] freaksho_: pretty sure using an autoclicker is against rules
[3:10:39] BlessingRP: somebody time the last 10 and everybody else open then
[3:10:40] Hezi9s: RiP fiona
[3:10:42] zakataha1: @Magzzy thats so shit man
[3:10:42] dasidehustle: ray dont make him go out there bruh getting robbed

[3:10:44] alxcrtifyd: UK people are 10 secs ahead
[3:10:44] ashlllyyyy: @Magzzy meta ?
[3:10:47] WebGems: @Magzzy classic 0.4
[3:10:52] SunflowerJessie: @magzzy don’t meta on who got it
[3:10:55] riftshadow: The problem with that system as implemented is it will just encourage bot clickers.
[3:10:55] certified_pro05: CHAT STOP THE META DAMN
[3:10:56] brittbritt90d: yea it's literally a ping game to get the jobs lol

[3:11:53] TheDudeeeeeeeee: They should add some kinda auction period of a min or two, would be neat
[3:11:54] cbjester: @ggchatter2023 I wonder if changing your PC's clock would affect that or not. Probably not. Also, that'd obviously be a bannable thing.
[3:11:54] zakataha1: ooc its so boring and unfaire
[3:11:58] Major_Surge: bouseGrime

[4:40:38] k_xrl: @kezerz thats their personality, being cringe and making multiple alt-accounts to chat hop
[4:40:38] xShuugo: @tigimci im talking about CG. They lost 1 because someone else got it faster than Zaceed (CG's lowest timer)

[4:41:51] TheDudeeeeeeeee: UK time travelers op KEKW
[4:41:52] eljerble: Langs crew said the same thing
[4:41:53] orvusaria: Zakid is glitched and his shit is a whole 10 sec ahead @Ray__C
[4:41:54] shahul: they should put a cooldown on HQ apps so same people dont hit again and again
[4:41:55] TemporaryEvil: people see it about 10 seconds ahead of you, its impossible
[4:41:55] ToTheSameHeights: need a better system for sure
[4:41:56] misaphi11: xdd
[4:41:57] georgieporge23: yup stupid system.

[4:41:59] twntys7v: yea that’s how it is trying to get shoes lol
[4:42:01] Orbifik: because some ppl are exploiting it
[4:42:01] Saintbunny7x7x7: @orvusaria not true
[4:42:02] ThreshMasterHook: maybe ui-r for faster refresh rate
[4:42:02] braveygaming: It would be cool if there was a hack to get it, instead of a click first battle
[4:42:03] quadity2: Yea huge problem tbh, gonna get changed 100%
[4:42:03] Ninja_v1: client-side is the real problem
[4:42:03] KEZERZ: Ping wars
[4:42:03] SmashNDash09: You think they should do a bid thing like they did with boost?
[4:42:04] FiftyQL: it is dumb indeed
[4:42:04] TriHardNerd: TRUE
[4:42:04] boobaisgood: Click it first and with ping is ridiculous
[4:42:05] LMNfm: It's fcfs those
[4:42:05] skygagex: it should be a wheel like rust
[4:42:05] Boosted4dr: 30-40 crims spamming computers lol

[4:42:07] SpikeTrees: ticket sales simulator
[4:42:07] p__dragon: !meta @orvusaria
[4:42:07] MAB09x: Everytime I tune into Ray's stream the chat is on fire man. I feel for you bro
[4:42:07] rulerofdoge: its not even a click it first battle when people have a 10 second lead
[4:42:07] RaycBot: For any game that Ray plays: Do not share in-game information regarding other players/content creators. Ray doesn't want to know and this can instead harm his in-game decisions. This may result to a time out or ban without warning. Feel free to meta in appropriate channels on !discord. Thank you WeDoNotCare
[4:42:08] cg4life21: So because u can't do it. It's weird????
[4:42:08] Tueur562: Yeah they need to put cooldowns on apps adding and removing etc. getting weird
[4:42:09] Gonkish: yeah, feels like the system needs to obfuscate info a ton and then add in some randomization to make it fairer, this one seems to promote camping
[4:42:10] faantix1: so one team could get all of the ammunation contracts because of a bugged system and fuck over the whole server if they had enough butc LMFAO what a joke
[4:42:10] Lurdzz: langs crew have the same issue
[4:42:11] Catlikescoffee: literally like copping new yeezy irl
[4:42:12] hornycoral: Devs have brain rot i fear

[4:42:13] helloboubou: "the click war" KEKW
[4:42:13] NotKoos: Devs will see it and it would get fixed
[4:42:14] Magzzy: @Ray__C  thats because other people have 10 seconds ahead of everyone
[4:42:14] FeRmEImHell: they should be hack on it @Ray__C wo solve it got it
[4:42:15] Chronage92: ping gang
[4:42:16] VoltKK_: some people have 10sec faster
[4:42:16] ERAsmosis: I think bid wars would be more interesting
[4:42:17] sirbrandonrocks: well if it's a bidding system it would be the richest groups getting it all the time anyway
[4:42:17] lostsouls21121: crazy cuz if you got it you woupbe salty
[4:42:17] Maxwon: @orvusaria stop, its all UK people
[4:42:18] dhugh034: ITS JUST GUNS ANYWAY, I DONT THINK SLACKS WOULD APPROVE
[4:42:18] p0p19: server rollback needs to happen
[4:42:19] detorlucifer: @Ray__C GIVE ME A NEW IDEA
[4:42:21] BoxFan112: @lmnfm sure so why does X care so much about making sure he gets so many guns? Lol
[4:42:22] calmcity: take break with kit its fine
[4:42:22] killogic916: How could the Devs made a WORSE system than 3.0 @Ray__C
[4:42:23] sandzbf: @cg4life21 cringe man
[4:42:23] Starscream1379: @orvusaria he ain’t the only one. someone beat him on the one 20 minutes ago
[4:42:23] nioxes12: @shahul they will get minions to do it with a different app so they can still hit it like 3-4x
[4:42:24] 714LEO: bid system would be better
[4:42:27] lively021: I think it's fair since its rng
[4:42:27] sshineysean: stream hopping is cool. always nice to multiple perspectives in real time. hopping just to meta dumb shit is just cringe  LUL
[4:42:27] Landarokz: The visible timer is client side, so who ACTUALLY knows if it's up when it says it's up if the server timer is invisible
[4:42:29] shogunlexx: Looks like first come first served but timer is off it's not the same for all
[4:42:30] detorlucifer: @Ray__C pls
[4:42:31] trekkky: its doomed
[4:42:31] pcut: @Ray__C Its probably because they're trying to prevent this from becoming the 3.0 bank spam. Its not easy to sync this against 100+ people on a server too. I'm sure they'll get it right eventually.
[4:42:31] ZPanda_MS: Fiverr devs LUL

[4:44:08] BoxFan112: @lmnfm it was about being first for X on the dongles is what I'm saying, so he couldn't so now he's all about what he does if he's not robbing, he's shooting lol

[7:55:35] K4NN4N_: It's more competition for ammunation
[7:55:37] detorlucifer: @Ray__C do u like long hair or short hair on raymonds charcter
[7:55:40] jerm_56: Selling it makes more competition for ammo heists

[7:55:42] PeterDragon: Its not worth to sell when you need it now
[7:55:43] lippy03: You have none to sell right this second tho and still do the jobs today

[7:56:37] lildawg21212: thats dumb tho guns are way more important
[7:56:39] teriyaki35: if he sells 10 they still have enough for the ammo
[7:56:44] heliosmagnitudo: tbh money is kinda less important than butc when it comes to do crime
[7:56:44] RyForShort: @Ray__C i need more EU ray plz xD i fell asleep as you went live earlier
[7:56:48] GeneralPearTree: immediate liquid is more flexible than a stockpile of buttcoin YEPPERS
[7:56:48] milllajs: 10 butcoin is not that much in the long run, but 18 k can get you mats to make more
[7:56:50] Sh4rkill3r: with the cost of magazines and ammo and future 250 job you are wrong
[7:56:50] KushKowboy6: there is technically 4 groups benefiting from pooling the butc with the company. it’s more than most crews can say.
[7:56:50] zach1745: Take the last 2 ammu heist is good tho

[11:13:53] IGotItFromMyMam4: werent it 7 days?
[11:14:11] ArtemisRost: @wormrain no, other groups have progressed on it but not The Company yet
[11:14:11] tuvix2: @ggchatter2023 guns have more uses than countering the jobs
[11:14:17] nuqz1: bidding would probably be the fairest option
[11:14:22] wormrain: @ArtemisRost ok
[11:14:29] Biuntx: u need butcoin for the job in 2 day

[11:15:00] FunnyValentine1847: @temperestre2 if you want conflict you can always start another war for conflict, camping heist, counter progression for other groups getting old real quick, it creates  a snow-ball effect and will be unfun for everyone.

[11:24:37] CadonaTac: @expected24 Benji got the exact same bug, I think the devs were trying something with the upgraded HQ from the 6 USBs and it bugged
[11:24:37] xxhellmoexx: I am happy to here you will be in a schedule and be able to play with both OTT and benji, however I am sad because that is going to be during my sleeping period lol.
[11:24:40] tuvix2: @ggchatter2023 if you think X and Mr K will be ostracized,  then I have a bridge to sell you
[11:24:41] Sh4rkill3r: ott have the shit materials for make a gun @Ray__C
[11:24:43] groggy73: Where did Ray get the 500 per bullet number from?
[11:24:44] jordanoftheskidmarks: jordanoftheskidmarks subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 31 months! 
[11:24:45] RaycBot: Thank you @jordanoftheskidmarks for the 31 months of subs!
[11:24:47] StreamElements: Twitch Ads are enabled by default on this channel. They come around every 20 minutes, for about 60 seconds. There are ways to fight back against ads, such as subscribing to the channel, Twitch Turbo, among other means! Thank you for watching!
[11:24:57] CadonaTac: @groggy73 It costs 1 BUTC per bullet
[11:25:03] p__dragon: did you find mats to buy or borrowing ott stash?
[11:25:04] kronn505: @ggchatter2023 they shouldn't be able to get mats at this point tbh. Only by robbing or get goons to run sani... in the long run, robbing 24/7 doesn't seem feasible
[11:25:06] alpasoup1: @bleepinbloopin  you need guns for the heistz, and The Max Jewelry run, apparently the local shot from roof tops

[11:25:36] EmryG: @CadonaTac how tho? 50/200 is 0.25 butc per bullet
