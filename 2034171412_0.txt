[0:26:10] gostonko: NODDERS
[0:26:11] Ryhard20: gostonko finished mhm
[0:26:18] gostonko: yea so you dig your heels in
[0:26:25] gostonko: #justiceforstonko
[0:26:28] 4headsEmptyWallet: D: he did what
[0:26:38] epic_smee: He probably told other people and they were like "what the fuck Speedy" and then realized KEKW
[0:26:39] ViolenceOfDucks: more like he tried to be as annoying and impossible to work with to make you all go away
[0:26:42] meaalsh_darkvulture3397: harrCozy  that addicted LUL
[0:26:45] NemisizZ: ngl, i woulda told him that i did a favor telling him what would happen, and he should take that as is, its not like anyone needs his approval
[0:26:48] gostonko: for the record would 100% steal that japanese knife nidasScheme
[0:26:52] IcantStopEatingPizza: He didn't want to get pressed I guess

[0:27:19] Ryhard20: I was watching from Omies POV and couldnt believe Speedy was defending somebody that he knew 3 weeks so heavily
[0:27:24] TheUcas: Or Lang talked some sense into him
[0:27:34] gostonko: could still be a smokescreen or... a schnake screen
[0:27:39] epic_smee: I still think its super risky to sling Weed with a key on you.
[0:27:40] harucanne: Yeah choosing his worker over 4head and ming is crazy
[0:27:42] saccriel: this was offline right?
[0:27:45] Chr12x: or he explained it to land and land told him to make it right
[0:27:51] 7thLettter: I don’t think speedy understood the severity of a key being taken
[0:28:23] Mantelrorelsen: New situations makes new rules. Now everyone knows the complexity of getting a housekey stolen.

[0:28:42] Dierseus9: it is weird that you have to stash your key all the time
[0:28:43] Chr12x: maybe you can upgrade to code locks later on
[0:28:45] NemisizZ: yeah to easy
[0:28:46] harucanne: Maybe you can track the key that would be good
[0:28:47] 4headsEmptyWallet: Yeah real reason behind it
[0:28:56] 911_raj: make be some hacks at door don't know
[0:29:02] Korejec: maybe key + code and you would need some hack for the code
[0:29:08] AloofMango: 20k
[0:29:11] Sylverphyre: finding out where a person lives is too easy with MDW and real estate page, IRL getting a key means nothing not knowing where they live
[0:29:11] NemisizZ: lol those influencer prices Kappa
[0:29:11] donazeri: + more chances to get it stolen
[0:29:13] gostonko: need to add airtags to the keys BebeLa
[0:29:15] tim212_: I’m surprised phones don’t have pins on them aswell seems dumb that you can rob it and have access immediately to everything
[0:29:16] GoRibGo: They don't even need to take it, just have a mold on them
[0:29:17] kappakenji31: I think if that was cheaper it wouldn't be as much of a problem
[0:29:30] NemisizZ: who came up with the cost of a key?
[0:29:36] wasited95: U can allways have a Key in a stash Car
[0:29:42] onix146: mhm lesson learned
[0:29:43] donazeri: yes
[0:29:44] epic_smee: True
[0:29:45] gostonko: that would be way too powerful
[0:29:45] GoRibGo: Yeah, apparently you can
[0:29:48] 7thLettter: only property owner can duplicate no?
[0:29:48] killing4pleasure: mold the key during the robbery and put the og one back on them
[0:29:49] 1void1x: there should be a security at the door or something
[0:29:49] gostonko: jeez
[0:29:51] srirachawoah: the fact that you can go to the app and see every house sold isn’t great
[0:29:51] 4headsEmptyWallet: mhm
[0:29:56] Sniferas1: u can copy the key on the spot
[0:29:56] ikrstfu: powegaming 101 NODDERS
[0:29:56] Pashinko: And then return it
[0:29:58] Leonaus_: yesterday Peanut went up to the Lumber Unions trailer, thinking thats where marty lived and held up the guy at the door KEKW Imagine if it was just that one guy and none of his friends were around. They would lose almost everything
[0:30:05] Sylverphyre: it's too easy finding out where ppl live, if it was harder, leads to more RP also
[0:30:10] shadowhadfallen: hack doors different doors can be added for security
[0:30:16] GoRibGo: I agree, I mean you'd see the robber doing it irl
[0:30:36] tim212_: I feel like a general rule kinda needs adding so randoms don’t just hold up people for keys
[0:30:37] Spondooley: yeah like i know it’s not real life but irl you need a machine to cut a key lol
[0:30:40] NemisizZ: also kinda powergaming
[0:30:41] 911_raj: make a airlock lol rust
[0:30:45] CyniuThunder: nidasSquat
[0:30:50] TheDolph_: its chips
[0:30:50] gostonko: nidasSquat
[0:30:51] Ryhard20: Omie was saying that that is also little powerful since you just put away  the car and you good
[0:30:54] TheDolph_: crespo
[0:30:54] Leonaus_: Unsurprisingly Eugene came up with that LULW
[0:30:55] Glaas__: Appy Tewsday boss, hope you and yours are well
[0:31:00] gostonko: KEKW
[0:31:03] ikrstfu: true KEKW
[0:31:03] TheDolph_: cheap**
[0:31:07] harucanne: Pass code would be nice aswell, so you need key and the passcode
[0:31:11] Glaas__: Glaas__ subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 21 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Appy Tewsday boss, hope you and yours are well
[0:31:11] StreamElements: Glaas__ just subscribed for 21 months in a row! Welcome back. nidasSquat nidasRich nidasSquat
[0:31:15] Pashinko: In real life you just make a mold with playdo/soft clay
[0:31:29] Pashinko: And then make a key later
[0:31:31] 4headsEmptyWallet: mhm
[0:31:31] GlitchyByte: irl also you live there and are there a lot. a robber would need to case the place. in game, people log out and are not there
[0:31:32] JohnMowgli: It's also the fact that it is so easy to find out where people lives.
[0:31:33] NemisizZ: reason being it can be stolen and u get ur house robbed
[0:31:39] Mantelrorelsen: It should exist a safety keyring, that has personal access except from police force.
[0:31:45] Leonaus_: Its realistic but the problem is that the game has an unrealistic amount of crime. Irl we dont constantly think about our house getting broken into because what are the chances?
[0:31:53] GoRibGo: Keys shouldn't be so many dollars
[0:32:00] Korejec: me swallows key (best option)
[0:32:01] enar_ixo: You should need the key to access the garage imo
[0:32:05] NemisizZ: and a key in real life doesnt cost more than 20 dollars lol
[0:32:24] gostonko: mhm
[0:32:36] ikrstfu: but cheaper keys, many keys will exist KEKW
[0:32:43] Conz3D: In real life if you got some key you don't know the house where it belongs too. That's a big difference.
[0:32:44] ikrstfu: oh yea, that's good
[0:32:45] NemisizZ: should only be the master key that could be copied
[0:32:51] enar_ixo: Cheaper to change locks
[0:32:51] haha_been: what about a keypad
[0:32:54] kuldeep6898: Just waiting for the day when 4head will lose his key bcz he said earlier he is a big dog 😅😅😅
[0:32:58] WundertueteGER: maybe cheaper on the first key
[0:33:01] ikrstfu: expensive if it's not your house
[0:33:05] 1void1x: there should be a security code at the door or something
[0:33:08] quote_me_if_horsen: make stealing a key or copy it a money sink to balance it
[0:33:08] Leonaus_: You should only be able to duplicate a key by going to the locksmith npc @Nidas Not carrying around a mold that you can use instantly when you rob someone
[0:33:10] NemisizZ: a lot of places wont copy keys unless u got the master key
[0:33:12] Leonaus_: Yea exactly
[0:33:12] 4headsEmptyWallet: 4head said he will hide the key in his belly
[0:33:12] Gladie209: not everyone know how to copy key even with they tool for it
[0:33:28] rasinblin: maybe a place you take the key too to get it cut and then the more expensive price comes in
[0:33:28] killing4pleasure: mhm
[0:33:37] DemiEllz: more rp around it as well
[0:33:39] rasinblin: like a locksmith
[0:33:39] harucanne: mhm that would be more interesting
[0:33:40] AziXuss: This would be an interesting mechanic
[0:33:41] Dierseus9: that seems good
[0:33:49] gungabruh: someone probably said something like this but it would be cool if opening the door had some sort of finger print scan which recognizes anyone with access to edit, if someone without access gets a key they have to do some sort of hack to get in, failing results in notifying each person with access to the house
[0:33:50] Dierseus9: leaves some evidence as well
[0:33:50] kingklistirvii: yeah pocket key cutter is kind of broken, should be harder
[0:33:55] defxoul: house titles? ooh.
[0:33:56] thajollypirate: or you have to have a soap or something when u copy someone elses
[0:34:00] gostonko: Lingbergs Locksmith LLC mhm
[0:34:06] Tuturruu_: What could help a lot with the griefing is if you can recycle old keys to makie new ones for cheap
[0:34:14] 911_raj: or 3d printer which makes some things
[0:34:21] haha_been: what if they have a keypad that is really hard to hack
[0:34:41] haha_been: mhm

[0:36:04] GoRibGo: Was lucky speedy knew the guy
[0:36:08] penstemon_: Ming getting robbed in the southside is quite rare tbh
[0:36:17] Mantelrorelsen: More accepted to steal a key during a gang-war
[0:36:20] gostonko: 100%
[0:36:32] Sylverphyre: I imagine they'd introduce keypad locks or more later for a price
[0:36:34] gostonko: WWRBD, what would ratboy do nidasO
[0:36:36] 911_raj: door camping with a sb
[0:36:38] haha_been: omieDanse

[0:37:14] OneVoodoo: 3 years, I am not stuck ok? nidasHISS
[0:37:25] FragSkin: taking a key should be all ok, but making a copy should only be for owners to do
[0:37:25] smellipoopipiipii: It's weird that you need a second home for the key for your home
[0:37:31] rasinblin: have you seen the weights of weed? a brick is lighter than a bag do you think its a mistake if you have seen it?
[0:37:32] gostonko: KEKW

[0:37:38] OneVoodoo: peepoSad
[0:37:43] rasinblin: just curious
[0:38:03] icantremember3: Ott took a key from a guy only after the guy was talking shit while he was being robbed
[0:38:05] DariusTheYeti: maybe a feature where you could break off the key in the lock and no one has access until the lock is replaced
[0:38:11] Sniferas1: raffle today??
[0:38:21] GoRibGo: Maybe you can get an incognito inventory slot or something,  keep a key in your boot type thing
[0:38:23] Sylverphyre: @4headsemptywallet didn't Eugene camp Company house?
[0:38:32] warrantyvoidifremoved: I also feel like records of what people own in the city shouldn't be as easily accessible to the public, seems too easy to get that information with not a lot of rp
[0:38:33] JamesDwho: OCR the text and put it into Excel?

[1:25:11] SkaldFKACC: we need aggro dogs!
[1:25:19] pratxp: every trap is different
[1:25:21] JoeKsova: could have different types of security for different levels of clients

[1:25:26] Aiiiiiiiii: @SkaldFKACC, murder kitties

[1:28:41] the_real_comu: maybe it dries quicker
[1:28:42] CopperKat: yeah just seems strictly worse but maybe wood price is inflated
[1:28:50] reagon_plays: if it does dry faster then it is useless
[1:28:57] yeslewd: so 2 extra slots for 1700
[1:28:57] reagon_plays: if it does'nt dry faster then it is useless
[1:29:03] NemisizZ: if there any benefits with the big one
[1:29:07] yeslewd: arent small ones like 2.8
[1:29:13] LeTrash_: Devs probably didnt predict the wood union making prices so high
[1:29:15] Hope1409: is it not fastet?
[1:29:18] StreamySauce: But they also seem to take up more space in the house right, the medium racks
[1:29:23] Hope1409: faster*
[1:29:23] JoeKsova: smaller racks can stack too, big racks take up more space
[1:29:27] rjoconnor: did the vagos try and dry yet and see if its faster
[1:29:33] StreamElements: Socials: Discord - https://discord.gg/nidas | Twitter - https://twitter.com/nidastwitch
[1:29:35] mariuspure: even if its 2.5 days instead of 5 days its still kinda shit for now unless the turf selling starts working and you need to min max the drying
[1:29:36] gostonko: some guys just like a bigger rack

They are too poor to move, they dont have a social structure surrounding them, and it's generally a sad situation. Best thing to do is move yourself.
