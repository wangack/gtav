[1:53:53] m331o: u need eu members
[1:53:55] khanoute: Raia can grind a lot but it's a bit of waste of her character, she'd have to ignore the constant phone calls and sidequests

[2:07:18] pineapplegladiator: Twat is Vee's rep?
[2:07:23] Tenivir: legion_al cuz its meta knowledge and not allowed on the server really
[2:07:23] pineapplegladiator: In sani?
[2:07:23] DesignII: @legion_al a ban
[2:07:30] justCoopp: @acie, back from work hi brie
[2:07:31] mavericks312: raia has unlocked her crime arc now

[2:08:05] pineapplegladiator: She can bring Zacheed
[2:08:05] RayRey22: nunu can do it
[2:08:06] Tenivir: I think Raia just needs to find one thing she enjoys and let her do it
[2:08:06] tiny_medic: I feel sorry for her
[2:08:08] Tenivir: same with nunu
[2:08:14] AFFABLE__: Her 'mom' has the biggest grime truck?
[2:08:16] estupidhigh: girl ughhhhhh
[2:08:16] bra1nd3adp3gasus: Vee and Jason are in a rush becuse they will quit RP in 6 months while everyone else will still play for another 2+ years
[2:08:22] mavericks312: @thricerice1 not true hell spaceboy does 0 work an has a blast all day lol
[2:08:26] eFiend: should do it with nunu
[2:08:28] khanoute: Raia would rather do sani with 4 then Grime alone for sure
[2:08:34] pineapplegladiator: @crazyiitopii Not bad actually
[2:08:38] Fabio10296: HandsUp
[2:08:41] thricerice1: without vee this gang would be nowhere close to their current state
[2:08:43] willowompoo: raia's contribution to the group is the Yuno summon nmpKEK
[2:08:44] auxfrog: nunu can atleast help with laundromat
[2:08:46] IVoDI_Mz: @bra1nd3adp3gasus what's there to rush right now
[2:08:49] Alaineman: Tanking sani rep SAJ
[2:08:50] nuhbinho: honestly you guys should call raia and set her free, tell her to make money however she can and just go back to meeting people and getting into situations
[2:08:54] vazeline__: @bra1nd3adp3gasus Or maybe they just like progression
[2:08:55] mavericks312: @bra1nd3adp3gasus true jason an vee are playing the short game while the others are playing the long game
[2:08:56] Vesquix: @bra1nd3adp3gasus Regardless of if thats true they would still want to progress

[2:09:18] ALXD_: @khanoute but raia takes 1 hr to do 1 sani run
[2:09:19] Tenivir: thricerice1 yeah but that is looking at it purely from a farming mats/money POV, its an RP server
[2:09:22] thricerice1: yeah yuno is the only big contribution that raia did
[2:09:26] PerriSick: @bra1nd3adp3gasus 6 months? PepeLaugh
[2:09:29] letsgetone: ask Raia to become the a mechanic for the group like Nunu should have
[2:09:34] justCoopp: @acie, back from work hi brie
[2:09:39] chilean_sub: @VaeelL I think theyre speedrunning it actually
[2:09:42] Dumi90: @thricerice1 true

[2:10:01] willowompoo: @tenivir tell the devs that NotLikeThis
[2:10:03] sfpotatoboiz: Felony incoming

[2:10:10] vazeline__: @mavericks312 Y‚Äôall are schizoing about shit. Everyone else is also trying to progress.
[2:10:11] OTCountdown: @Shivie78 yeah I'm surprised she isn't a part of this group
[2:10:19] vel3no_: @letsgetone Jason told nunu weeks ago "we dont need a mechanic we have Nino"
[2:10:21] LazyMike: @letsgetone Raia has to much ADHD for that
[2:10:21] plmmue: Puiu»õ
[2:10:24] ekahS_: PogU Vault 76
[2:10:30] thricerice1: Eugene even said that people who religiously RP in 3.0 are grinding
[2:10:33] ekahS_: PogU or Vault 101

[2:10:41] qihk: Nunu will def run Grime
[2:10:52] letsgetone: oh ok I wasn‚Äôt aware thanks
[2:10:54] DesignII: @pablohoney___ where is nino now
[2:10:56] mavericks312: @vazeline__ bro James Randall gives 0 about progression he just messes around for 8 hrs
[2:10:57] Drmarshmelluw: @thricerice1 the problem is everyone will grind no matter what
[2:10:59] Alaineman: There isn't really anyone in the group suited for mechanic except tolan in terms of mindset i think
[2:11:03] SpaceG33k: its a balance right, cant to one thing all the time
[2:11:06] Redoxok: Things are waay too expensive
[2:11:08] willowompoo: it's an MMO server nmpKEK
[2:11:11] florda: you need to grind to unlock rp
[2:11:13] vazeline__: Y‚Äôall are one of the top crews.
[2:11:16] Drmarshmelluw: you are right
[2:11:16] Tenivir: behind what though? it depends if you see it as a competition and with who
[2:11:19] Tenivir: you are one of the top gangs
[2:11:19] nikulaz_: The grinding stops once ya'll are at 50 coin per day

[2:11:29] KnocturnalSLO: No Pixel 4.0 is more grindy then previous
[2:11:31] willowompoo: they need to grind to unlock content which is so ass
[2:11:32] ramoj007: its a setup/built-up  RP game Chat
[2:11:33] khanoute: There's no mechanic around to teach anything anymore, even the master mechanics don't log on nowadays
[2:11:37] k_enix: not that behind
[2:11:37] qihk: The only 3 people Vee has Sani connects are Patar, Levi and Larry.
[2:11:39] arkxpert: only company is ahead of you and they have a lot of people
[2:11:39] caligirlbeaches: The days get waisted
[2:11:40] delix_o7: actual GTA MMO

[2:11:53] FRAlex010: confince them to do then
[2:11:57] sfpotatoboiz: No grind? Sad day
[2:11:57] caligirlbeaches: Tell Raia to do Sani
[2:11:58] Tenivir: mavericks312 yeah funny as hell and the kind of stuff the server needs
[2:11:58] Barbayo: grind to get head SusgeNote
[2:11:59] rudytc: need to keep some sanity tho, grinding too much is not good
[2:12:00] crazyiitopii: True
[2:12:01] Alaineman: The jobs in the city are not balanced enough.
[2:12:02] ironbullman: ya soon you'll be able to chill Aware
[2:12:02] PrettyKrazy: @khanoute Dentge but how did they learn?
[2:12:02] Olvi12: @khanoute, because its a waste of time rn. Mats are expensive and the mayor wont give out business licenses or whitelisted jobs
[2:12:06] Turboz__: What's your current coin per day?
[2:12:06] mavericks312: @prettykrazy bro the only master mechanic doesn‚Äôt even log on anymore lol
[2:12:07] nikulaz_: If Raia and Nunu locked in for 2 days off stream you guys would be good
[2:12:07] counttolstoy: @joyoruz its an RP server
[2:12:08] Marilyn_1020: back in 3.0 their wasn‚Äôt this much grind
[2:12:08] Mr_Tvi: Even the crim shit is rep based, they're gonna have to lock in eventually
[2:12:08] Tenivir: mavericks312 but some see it as a waste of time sadly
[2:12:09] Dumi90: @arkxpert lmfao thats not true theres like 5 or more gangs ahead of them what u talk about
[2:12:13] joyoruz: in the snr buns
[2:12:17] rahiraven: AYOO
[2:12:19] KenshinOfAstora: om
[2:12:19] Alaineman: Get a head
[2:12:23] crazyiitopii: Grind first the RP will come naturally
[2:12:25] slimjim587: You need to tell them and not put up with all the hdmi
[2:12:25] nikulaz_: maybe one of you need to take raia's phone while doing sani
[2:12:28] PrettyKrazy: surely you can gain rep without a carry in mechanic, surely
[2:12:31] genn1_: You can get to certain amount of coins, but they're gonna bump the current and next prices because there are more coins in the city so  you'll need even ore coins a day
[2:12:32] OsiDRobles: On the first stages of the server you have a bunch of poor people grinding to get rich, then once we have people rich we will start getting businesses going and then the actual Rp can happen
[2:12:32] mavericks312: @tenivir anytime Eugene hangs with the littlemans it‚Äôs always pure gold
[2:12:48] khanoute: Civ Gang is way ahead where it should be based on their manpower, even Lang's crew has just 29 butcoins production atm
[2:12:50] AFFABLE__: You grandpa bought 2 cars, jason bought 2, alex bought one, raia bought one (with clays money) thats a lost of money blown. peepoShrug
[2:12:50] willowompoo: yeah like last night with dean got both grinding and rp

[2:13:16] m331o: merch with archi
[2:13:16] rudytc: easiest 2k
[2:13:22] Tresch: EZ Clap +2k
[2:13:22] thricerice1: it would takes a month before this server get any improvement to facilitate good RP
[2:13:28] mavericks312: @tenivir true but 4.0 viewership has dropped a lot because of how grindy it is compared to previous versions
[2:13:34] hafcabbage: woof
[2:13:34] xxPiteRxx: buddy
[2:13:35] Tenivir: khanoute yeah jasons car, imagine that went to gpus instead LUL
[2:13:37] caligirlbeaches: Vee Raia wants to do Sani
[2:13:38] khanoute: Vader can't even be bothered cleaning his crim money, he doesn't want to grind and he doesn't want others in the group to grind
[2:13:39] IVoDI_Mz: @thricerice1 way better than how 3.0 was honestly
[2:13:39] y0brandon1: PizzaTime
[2:13:40] LoneWolf_N7: if you get 300 sani, rp will open up for you cos ppl will come to you for deals
[2:13:40] Rockhound__97: So to chat - how long does this run before a update/reset?
[2:13:41] qihk: 2 + 2 + 2 + 2
[2:13:42] bigpri: you need to grind to open up rp opportunities like the heist wouldn't be possible if you guys didn't grind earlier
[2:13:45] dictator108: woof

[7:11:50] Amuze586: It seems like an imported dev toolkit, not designed to be super user friendly.
[7:12:08] Kangaroo_Balls: So they expect people to move everything out of a room before deleting a room? that's bad software design
[7:12:11] Setback1: it is

[7:42:13] BupeHappy: Bragging about ditching his homie, Jason's a psycho
[7:42:22] arkxpert: NVL is basically a rule to avoid this server turning into GTA online. so you can‚Äôt just depend on being better at weapons to get out of situations which you wouldn‚Äôt in real life. So don‚Äôt do dumb shit when a weapon is pointed at you directly @acie

[7:46:27] BupeHappy: @Albsxk I'm pointing out how hypocritical it was and is basically
[7:46:30] ribs010: @momzzyy as acting owner of civ gang, is Jason a cult leader out to take advantage of all the members of civ gang?
[7:46:30] goodenhi: @khanoute i agree thats my confusion too
[7:46:32] Tenivir: khanoute yeah but one character being like that automatically makes it hard for people to RP around it
