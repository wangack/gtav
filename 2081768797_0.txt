[3:42:27] kirk1022: nah, thats bullshit, I'd rather they increase the price of the license to 70K than purchasing guns that cost over 10K
[3:43:46] kirk1022: You can probably propose the same thing as G6  for the Diamond company
[3:44:01] chaosgeek1: @kirk1022 Things will change, inevitably , for the better or worse, no idea... but then it can't really get worse, so I'd predict better

[3:48:03] EskimoTheCat: Phone car
[3:48:36] chaosgeek1: @kirk1022 Well for Swan, yes. Marv really needs that legislation go through, cause a security company without guns, when everyone else has them is not gonnado well
[3:49:37] chaosgeek1: is that Sumwan
[3:50:00] kirk1022: @chaosgeek1 has he already registered his company/business thats 50K no?
[3:50:10] SaltySnacks20: or I guess Diamond could end up differentiating between firearms security and wrench/knife security guards for different sorts of tasks/clients with different pricing crystHmm
[3:50:10] kirk1022: Xavier :D
[3:50:53] kirk1022: Marv can just say that establishing his business without guns would be pointless if they arent allowed the same privilege as G6.
[3:51:11] Broberown: @gyinnyin tell her I say ThankEgg
[3:51:16] EskimoTheCat: Extra mustard, no ketchup crystDerp
[3:51:20] chaosgeek1: @kirk1022 Not sure... he has entered his businessplan for approval. And writing stuff like that is his thing, so I'm sure he'll get it

[4:02:02] kirk1022: @chaosgeek1 I've known about Diamond Division since he proposed it to Alexander River and shouldve worked side by side with G6, only makes sense because theyre both security companies and DD was supposed to be more like a squad.

[8:25:23] Rahjoth: @chaosgeek1 Written in 1998.
[8:26:27] chaosgeek1: @Rahjoth Well he could have written them
[8:26:59] Rahjoth: Do you think he was smart enough to make the abstractions about power? crystthink

[8:27:24] Rahjoth: OK Marv KEKW
[8:28:25] chaosgeek1: @Rahjoth Yes? The reason that he was so succeful in staying in power was that if that guy could do one thing it was make abstractions about power.
[8:29:14] chaosgeek1: Just because he was a terrible terrible person does not mean he wasn't competent at some things. As unfortunate as that may have turned out for the world

[8:32:24] chaosgeek1: That IS Swan
[8:33:38] Rahjoth: IIRC, the point of the book is not for someone to follow it to the T. I think the point is to be able to understand how manipulative people work.

[8:34:03] Rahjoth: I might have a PDF copy somewhere.
[8:34:55] Rahjoth: 48: Assume formlessness By taking a shape, by having a visible plan, you open yourself to attack. Instead of taking a form for your enemy to grasp, keep yourself adaptable and on the move. Accept the fact that nothing is certain and no law is fixed. The best way to protect yourself is to be as fluid and formless as water; never bet on stability or lasting order. Everything changes.

[12:57:50] Unmoving: First three guesses should use all vowels and most common consonants
[12:57:50] SaltySnacks20: grey = not in the word. Orange = in the word, but in a different spot. Green = right letter in the right spot.
[12:57:50] chaosgeek1: If the letter is green it's in the right spot

[13:28:20] Zombiesweat: I had a wired one for 6yrs no problem
[13:28:22] frozonhawk: i got a logitech, great mouse
[13:28:58] trustttttty: hard alcohol less likely to short circuit your keyboard than water NODDERS

[13:36:51] Nishiyoo: crystType
[13:36:56] frozonhawk: there's a pickup line in there, are we a keyboard because u and i are together
[13:37:06] Zombiesweat: ^
[13:37:36] trustttttty: worst habit was the bottom row ZXC keys, kept intermittently using them with my thumb instead of pinkie thanks to games
[13:38:28] Zombiesweat: I just don't use my pinkies
[13:38:40] Zombiesweat: asd all getting moved down to zxc
[13:38:43] discardpixel: enough time to sneak one in Prayge
[13:39:08] Rahjoth: @discardpixel new meta
[13:39:20] trustttttty: using pinkie is worth imo, hardest ones for the weakest fingers, why having a low actuation point switches helps
[13:39:41] Zombiesweat: what about shift
[13:40:05] Zombiesweat: The only time I really use my pinkies is on my way back from a far key
[13:40:11] Zombiesweat: now that I'm analyzing my typing habits
[13:40:30] discardpixel: thats crazy
[13:40:33] Zombiesweat: Like waltz
[13:40:41] Zombiesweat: or something
[13:40:53] trustttttty: @Zombiesweat i use pinky for em too, i use the opposite shift key with my pinky depending on my hand, left shift typing with right hand, right shift typing w/ left
[13:40:56] lollygagger808: its actually good to take breaks
[13:41:15] trustttttty: once you get a hang of alternating quickly between the two shifts it becomes so comfy
[13:41:26] trustttttty: Capitalization becomes Easy
[13:41:28] discardpixel: must type notAddict
[13:41:48] Zombiesweat: I don't think I'd be able to make that habit very easily
[13:41:51] Crystalst: if you're enjoying the stream, feel free to follow the channel & join the discord to know when I go live x
[13:42:08] Zombiesweat: I feel like my brain matches the shift with the letter I'm typing
[13:42:12] trustttttty: @Zombiesweat for me it was the hardest to get used took me an extra week to get comfortable
[13:42:20] Zombiesweat: Like left shift with left type etc
[13:42:23] Zombiesweat: as if it's one input
[13:42:36] Zombiesweat: because I need to prepare for the next key
