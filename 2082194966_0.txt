[1:11:39] lunarjester7: only workers use the trains, i've never known someone to use them for travel
[1:11:40] Jam_Plays_Games: remember when LA had a huge trolley car network and suddenly that all went away
[1:11:42] shittygardener: Lived 3 miles from work for a while, the bus route there would take 80 minutes. Beautiful planning peepoTeeth
[1:11:45] MrByte: Public transit in LA is PvP mode StabbyC StabbyM ffzX
[1:11:45] Mountiexbefs: Is Chicago safer?
[1:11:47] theanoncollector: Why would that area be uniquely dangerous?
[1:11:51] KingArchlich: @draftysnowman In fairness, the entire population of Canada is less than California alone. Its gotten close in recent years but population density is a pain with city planning
[1:11:53] wendywhoeatskazuha: america is wild to me
[1:11:53] bboyskeleton: Crime city vs city with crime
[1:11:53] jonnymad84: ny has a lot of lines ?
[1:11:58] fixer0ne: LA is unsafe to be outside in general. You are in a building or in a car for safety
[1:12:02] AlexHasTacos: dont go past 126th and you're ok
[1:12:05] ktermite: Where I live the public transportation is neutral ground
[1:12:10] bigmugi: @AlexHasTacos REAL KEKWWA
[1:12:16] shizzaams: It just depends on what street you're on and what time of the day it is
[1:12:20] snoopingasu: my sister was traveling through LA on a bus stop when a gang hit happened Aware thankfully she was safe but damn
[1:12:27] stachystat: monkaS
[1:12:28] MrByte: LA as a city encourages car culture. You're expected to drive everywhere.
[1:12:37] pxthony: Ngl I don't like suburbs and shit (like just a lot of plants) but I'm also not particularly enticed by the city (do prefer the comfort of it though)
[1:12:37] DRP303: I think ever major city has issues but tend to safer then its reputation.
[1:12:52] mr_dances: In CA if you don't sit in traffic in your car for commute you're taking a huge risk
[1:12:58] MagnificentSteve: Only thing with using NYC metro at night is to make sure you don't get carried away by the rats. LUL
[1:13:02] KingArchlich: @DRP303 The list of Sun-down cities begs to differ
[1:13:07] shizzaams: The police are also in gangs too so that's the big problem in LA
[1:13:10] twitches_champion: homeless people seek shelter in the train system and everyone drives so its empty
[1:13:15] PvtJet: Also different social safety nets, ability to find work and get to it
[1:13:20] PToastman: I see we're talking walkable cities again geegaBased
[1:13:21] MrByte: Even parts of LA's road network are PvP. The 91 Aware
[1:13:34] apocalyptic_warlock: @magnificentsteve thats just the express line zentreOL

[1:13:51] bigmugi: for the most part geegaNODDERS the buses gotten a bit better but its still meh
[1:13:51] smashyphone: I just like convenience. walking is nice.
[1:13:51] Mashimaro87: Last I checked the metro closed at like midnight here in LA. I've never heard anything about it being super unsafe, but also nobody I know really uses them because they're not super well laid-out for getting where you want to go
[1:13:58] 0BodyBag: anime41Heart anime41Drunk
[1:13:58] shizzaams: There was that Arizona neighborhood that was claiming to be the first walkable neighborhood in America or something

[1:14:34] 91xex: Any cities in Korea like walking through there?
[1:14:34] GrimyEel: oh yeah metro closes at midnight in DC too
[1:14:36] bboyskeleton: I don't take it a ton but Chicago trains feels pretty safe
[1:14:36] Shibato7: monkaa
[1:14:41] shizzaams: Atlanta is like that too, I think it's midnight or 1 am
[1:14:44] smashyphone: oh shit I gotta do my dalies
[1:14:47] theanoncollector: Seems like so many cities are almost irreparably fucked. And now they got commercial real estate dropping.
[1:14:50] legitdonotknow: The bus system in my area sucks, they are never on time and don't come until 7am MAYBE and stop around midnight
[1:14:51] Tiilde: yep chicago was like that
[1:14:51] Dire_Squid: if you're in the metro when midnight happens is it like a cinderella thing
[1:14:53] bigmugi: Buses are the same, theyll be done by midnight
[1:14:53] Dire_Squid: and you live there now
[1:14:53] Ryuko95: rprExplain walkable cities? like the glorious city of Chicago, IL? rprExplain did you know the transit spans the whole city and goes to 2 major airports?
[1:14:56] pxthony: Is this JYP?
[1:15:08] Merryweather: hellu geega merryMelt
[1:15:15] im_mae_: i lived in ny during covid and had a night job and it did suck a little bit bc they stopped doing night trains

[1:15:31] Mountiexbefs: only time it would make sense to run it late would be the weekend for all the bar / club traffic
[1:15:31] ktermite: You'd hate Portland ME. The public transportation shuts down an hour before the bars close.
[1:15:34] jonnymad84: 24h really??
[1:15:38] Shibato7: AWOO
[1:15:38] smashyphone: I’m from upstate so I don’t really know how it compares to NYC

[1:16:14] fixer0ne: have had many a bender in NYC, and have never had a problem catching a train
[1:16:15] Last_Paragon: Suburbanites are always scared of public transit so it's hard to tell when it's actually sketchy
[1:16:19] guzzjiggler: boneCheck
[1:16:20] audreystralian: i was on the bus in LA, and some guy threw these eggs in plastic containers at people
[1:16:22] MrByte: My wife's work is like 3 miles away, but the ONLY way to get there is to drive. Trying to walk or bike there would get you killed by a car. Aware
[1:16:25] jasherms: monarchHeart monarchHeart
[1:16:27] roagrr: nodd trains my beloved
[1:16:32] PvtJet: @last_paragon preach
[1:16:37] mr_dances: I used to use busses in the SoCal area. Most unreliable transportation. A bicycle is better.
[1:16:43] jonnymad84: also bus 24h?
[1:16:57] pxthony: DO YOU KNOW? YOUR LOVE IS TRUE I KNOWW~~~
[1:16:58] magidoss: I live in a pretty big city in germany and its always wild when i have to go to the outskirts suddenly busses and trains only come by every 30 to 60 mins instead of every 10 ryuko9Despair
[1:17:05] bboyskeleton: from rural Oklahoma to Chicago feels like an alien experience
[1:17:10] Ryuko95: xdding me telling kids in college to take the red line past 35th
[1:17:15] jcara514: The subway is nice but you get the most sketchy shit on the trains
[1:17:15] Dire_Squid: NYC transit is like starting on hard mode, you are barely allowed to stop and read signage
[1:17:20] Shibato7: ICANT
[1:17:20] MrByte: Honestly, when I visited Boston (first city with real public transit I went to) I was excited to ride the metro because trains peepoClap
[1:17:25] kyulen742: LUL
[1:17:31] eughfish_: visiting Switzerland the public transit runs so smoothly people get impatient when a bus is late
[1:17:39] apocalyptic_warlock: They gotta develop that NY power walk
[1:17:44] Battenhall: iirc the buses near here you wait anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour 30 between buses
[1:17:50] UwU_SweetSakura_OnO: KEKW
[1:17:51] Shibato7: you skip the tutorial for them KEKW
[1:17:52] shizzaams: Gotta get that busy body mindset going lol
[1:17:54] husky_dafuskie: I tried to walk out of O'Hare airport because I walk everywhere in my town, it didn't work out geegaWeega
[1:17:56] Vayseth: Most viral videos on public transport is the only impression people in the suburbs have sometimes so of course they think it's crazy
[1:17:59] im_mae_: thats why maps app was a saviour for me, because i barely had to parse through the signage
[1:18:06] pinkizzys: imo i haven't felt unsafe on la transit, BUT signage is garbo so it's overwhelming if you don't know where you're going
[1:18:08] Dire_Squid: yeah thankfully I get reception underground nowadays
[1:18:11] pxthony: @magidoss IT IS SOOO FUCKING BAD😭😭😭😭 ICH HASSE ES
[1:18:12] jcara514: One time I went on the subway and this guy had his bare ass plopped on the seat
[1:18:13] Mashimaro87: Public transport that gets lots of use is safer than empty, rarely used transpo. Same reason why areas with abandoned houses are more dangerous than densely populated areas - people who want to do bad things also want to get away with it
[1:18:19] seedsu: i live in a place in the uk where i can step out of my door and im 5 minutes away from either a train/bus line that can take me pretty much anywhere in the uk its great
[1:18:23] smashyphone: I kinda just like to run everywhere. everything is close enough that I can run to it and I’ll be there eventually.
[1:18:23] theanoncollector: When I visited NYC several years ago Google Maps was able to guide me no problem
[1:18:26] Pandoras_Box77: I visited NYC last summer, had no problems getting where I wanted to go
