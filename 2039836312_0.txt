[1:46:49] Hogie48: Some tsunami will change that at some point
[1:46:56] SergeGray: Hard to expect an unlock at 300 when there hasnt been one at 150, 200, or 250
[1:47:17] eazypzz: 250 you get 9 per recyclable i think
[1:47:33] emiz0r: lol

[2:29:11] Frozencurse: from wikiperia: The game's reveal trailer was met with high engagement on social media and mixed reception, ranging from excitement to disgust
[2:29:15] KingDekar: still EarlyAccess, but a lot of fun
[2:29:15] McMysteryRS: It will

[2:30:01] eazypzz: do pets have ranks ? like in gatcha games?
[2:30:03] broxx1: @mrdumpling420 why would they shut it down?
[2:30:11] eazypzz: rank upgrades*
[2:30:25] 19Timmy98: @mrdumpling420 There wont be no shutting down most likely, the patents are not reaching into this
[2:30:33] chefchad1: its up???  Benji is on and doing stuff...
[2:30:34] ProngsAedan: This is Buddha speaking. You’re done buddy, that's it, finito, hasta la vista. We gave you a chance and you shitted and cummed all over it. Please exit the game and throw away your computer. We asked for non-stop trash grinds, and you failed to do that. Taking a break from playing NP? See ya on palworld buddy. Kappa
[2:30:38] ProLike_That: Yeah @eazypzz but you dont get it till like 25-30
[2:30:44] BuckPlayaOne: SOLD
[2:30:50] f2pOH: Now get a gun, rob a pokemon harrBLAST
[2:30:55] FiniteResources: @chefchad1 it was fine until harry relogged
[2:31:02] Axy_p: @chefchad1 yeah but once you log out, you can’t go back in
[2:31:15] Oni_mara: is this rust meets pokemon
[2:31:16] izzygus333: its a bit buggy but stil very fun
[2:31:18] killlakaz: the game gets laggy the further away you are from the host like ark

[2:31:30] ososo: breath of the ark
[2:31:37] Foamed: btw, chat, the Steam version of Palworld is significantly better than the Gamepass and console versions, this is due to limitations set on the multiplayer servers. Gamepass/console is p2p (max 4 players) based and the Steam version has dedicated servers with support with up to 32 players.
[2:31:39] Sl33pyJinn: this game feels like a mish mash of gimmics
[2:31:40] ProngsAedan: @Oni_mara Ark meets pokemon in genshin world
[2:32:00] McMysteryRS: get a pickaxe and a club and you're chilling

[2:32:18] bigpredictable: pick up wood first
[2:32:20] shiifon: Ark with bootlegged pokemon look more fun then i thought
[2:32:26] f2pOH: Man is like Rocky straight punching that tree
[2:32:45] cheep_wow: @painkillerz143 I think it is one of those authenticating or login issues. Since Harry logged out he can't get back in but if you are already on the server you are fine
[2:32:47] bonewp: i trully cant undertand how this is so popular right now apart from beeing like a pokemon ark shit.
[2:32:50] ChemGodz92: rusty pokemans
