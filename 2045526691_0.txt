[4:29:43] Robo_Cat2000: now take those hours and cut off like 4 for travel gas food depot time
[4:29:43] HEYSLUGGER: damn, so mama makes about half of that then
[4:29:43] Khytran: the marketing time dilutes that, but its still crazy
[4:29:44] TheAirWalker: nah he must be bullshitting
[4:29:52] Kubz1: this is what war does to the economy
[4:29:57] Robo_Cat2000: and another 2 hours for repairs
[4:29:57] Pure36: @omie that's because the supply of wood takes too long to transport all that shit
[4:29:58] 5kitcher: supply and demand is stupid
[4:29:59] revenueprofit: @luckerooni bro is lying 😭
[4:30:01] HEYSLUGGER: still pretty damn good money at that rate
[4:30:04] darobi4: omieZombie
[4:30:04] Dice_DH: i guess the demand went up since storage is in more demand
[4:30:05] mortuusintus12: "hes almost out" is a marketing strat to make it justified to sell at 30
[4:30:09] Kitsoooooooo: no way that is right
[4:30:12] rjw29: better off paying 5 ppl to work with you at $8 per
[4:30:12] HanterXI: 2x

[4:30:27] thatdonkeyy: Got factor in time to sell it and deliver but pay someone else for that probably
[4:30:32] Khytran: Part of their "margin" is that they do the process with multiple workers and the profit is split though
[4:30:36] HEYSLUGGER: even at 10 per thats good money
[4:30:36] harhood: only certain grinders have the drive to farm all the demand
[4:30:37] luckerooni: @revenueprofit, if hes lying why do they have people talking to them every day buying shit
