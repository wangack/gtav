[3:01:11] kaleidoskopeyes: do previous daps get removed by being fired? that part would be an advantage over being suspended
[3:01:32] random_viewer_55: @kaleidoskopeyes of course
[3:01:43] random_viewer_55: he's joining as a new cadet

[3:11:18] dillon_619: the unicorn will save the day trust me 😂
[3:11:21] Xierany: I'm okay with the RP the comes from it, but I don't agree with the decision, nor do I think it's okay to do it for the RP, if that's the case
[3:11:24] Zorfianna: @watermelon3001 Brows damn right
[3:11:36] LogicWeasel: @Xierany why is it not ok in RP ?

[3:12:15] Nightbot: AAAA
[3:12:25] Zorfianna: a pork chop suit KEKW
[3:12:43] Xierany: @Xierany Why I disagree with it? Cause he's been getting DAPed for things they don't have rules for, or things that other officers don't get DAPed for, or the last one that even McNulty said was a good pit
[3:12:52] Zorfianna: @D2Raspy congratulations
[3:13:31] notthatlizardguy: Hopefully it got randomized. One spot is just asking for campers
[3:13:43] I3eCynical: stealth lights
[3:13:55] Lunar_Delta: 133 Going dark
[3:14:15] bangerang2: I think it is the message that firing him says about him as opposed to suspension
[3:14:37] SymbioAgori: 2 so far
[3:14:43] gtsmiles: What about my boy, Ocean King?
[3:14:44] LogicWeasel: @Xierany ah ok, thought you were talking about the Strike.  I agree with you.
[3:14:57] alyx_bunny43: What'd I miss? Tldr?
[3:15:09] Xierany: I agree with the Johnson one, Shiesty just feels wrong. And it does fit McNulty to stay with it
[3:15:27] Trenchtown__: aziz is his partner, makes sense he is tilted. also it wasnt nice no  ruth so much waiting
[3:15:31] RadahTatTat: all you need is decker on shift to hold it down like before AAAA
[3:15:41] 7griffo7: A senior officer striking would be a bad move lol
[3:16:02] Zorfianna: bazzB
[3:16:06] zac4e: hryLafExceptInPain

[3:16:24] MindlessSeb: Just got in, who got fired? Shiesty and?
[3:16:25] JohnieP: You should've seen Rhodes freaking out about them this morning. It was hilarious.
[3:16:34] Xierany: @alyx_bunny43 Shiesty got fired, multiple officers are going 42 in protest
[3:16:36] 7griffo7: A black cop car with no working lights? completely safe dont worry about it LUL
[3:16:42] Trenchtown__: @Xierany yh johnson handled it poorly, den was classy with it all
[3:16:44] VSDuck: @JohnieP you got a clip?
[3:17:05] JohnieP: @vsduck Let me find it.
[3:17:29] notthatlizardguy: I think Johnson's response was just as good. It turned into some great rp
[3:17:59] LogicWeasel: McNulty has stronger resolve
[3:18:11] FlameReetardantPanda: dereliction of duty
[3:18:18] Xierany: Like regardless of what happens it's always gonna create RP. How it feels for them OOC is not great though
[3:18:47] spookyghost21: Prob better to 42 for a couple hours and vent off duty
[3:18:51] LogicWeasel: shit's heating up
[3:19:05] dreggy69: yeah its pretty juicy rn
[3:19:18] slymox: Cornwood really had to weigh what was going on
[3:19:21] spookyghost21: if it 4 days from now and they like Picketing out front that would actually be funny tho
[3:19:22] Lunar_Delta: OOOO
[3:19:28] slymox: it was a great character moment
[3:19:49] APHSnake: I will agree with Den being fired is going to have some good RP stories from it

[6:26:27] BrEySaC: this car is so op
[6:26:34] Xierany: @catfish_quackenbush All of the cop cars have major downsides tho. This car is hard to control, the other is very light, catches air and low top speed. Crims have the advantage but PD has many units and some top tier drivers keeping up
[6:26:40] Buffalohed: @BrEySaC the driver op
[6:26:44] random_viewer_55: @BrEySaC it's got high max speed but its a boat
