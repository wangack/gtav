[3:16:19] zenatr: Rule of 6 sounds more for active fighting, less interrogation. At least imo
[3:16:20] klugklug: hmjj
[3:16:22] prozorftw: I'd ask someone, i'll be honest
[3:16:24] prodiac: well, you handled it just fine, they didn't get involved
[3:16:25] comfycathie: HOA had dozens with that Yaeger kidnapping...im so confused
[3:16:26] PsychoBKilla: Is it the same as the Praia situation? Had a bunch of people during that torture scene
[3:16:28] Sonaro8: for that particular instance there was the aftermath of the crime not actually doing it?
[3:16:28] Sahneee: I think you guys just did it right but idk Shrug
[3:16:30] cuyliebear: Well, RP opportunities to learn!
[3:16:32] tak0g0dz: Speaking Japanese is no different than someone doing an accent
[3:16:36] Darkri19: You should be fine just more than 6 cant get involved in the rescue
[3:16:37] greatmuta2: There was nothing there that "rule of six" would apply too
[3:16:41] RTHIRO: could be awkward in a situation where Vinny rolls up and they can't do anything Hmm
[3:16:43] Meh17_: if you know no one will be coming it should be fine
[3:16:45] BeardedCaveMan_TV: but interrogation can lead to a fight so would just stay with 6 to be safe
[3:16:51] mugcostanza: Yeah
[3:16:54] FIunkifer: If there was someone trying to save him only 6 could get involved basically
[3:16:55] candorus: I always thought it was about an active PVP situation...but it's definitely a good scenario to talk to an admin about to get clarification about.
[3:16:58] Khaza_: People also play gang bangers without being that IRL
[3:17:02] PsychoBKilla: It's not a problem. People are just being dumb about it
[3:17:03] AetherMana: haters want a point to pick
[3:17:04] LuckyGeist: i think it depends on if people would try to save him or not
[3:17:06] ytu118: But if they find him at you have more than 6 it gets awkward
[3:17:06] zippybln2: can always ask an admin atinysShrug I would not rely on chats opinion on this LUL
[3:17:06] ZeroNeuro: they just wanna be mad. Any reason. Can't really make sense of it.
[3:17:07] Hyperion57: @Khaza_ WHAT
[3:17:08] kessy1893: they were all there at the shop and limiting a rule of 6 in this szenario limits rp imo
[3:17:08] zenatr: There's a gang called the fucking 'italians' and people dogpiles on the japanese LUL
[3:17:14] NotToTheFace: Like your actually learning Japanese maryying
[3:17:17] Blake2493: yeah thats what i was saying it got mixed in with chat though
[3:17:20] Gyfx: It says as PVP right? In that case if 6 people or police showed up while it may be a little awkward it can be handle easy with just putting people aside nodd
[3:17:22] Rex__84: It's not, it's just an easy target to talk shit about
[3:17:30] f4p__l0rd: You speaking japanese is immersive
[3:17:33] J0RDAN2KX: I think it awesome you actually speaking it rather than putting on a accent
[3:17:33] SwagnificentTG: And there’s like 4 people in the gang that ACTUALLY speak Japanese
[3:17:38] L4zyb4ssturd: mr k literally transform into "the Dragon"

[9:01:08] tigerland06: its tough with the loss of memory stuff. Hard to provide an affirmative defense.
[9:01:13] infamous_butcher: being grs positive is kinda damming.

[9:01:49] itspacecowboy: it looks bad. unless there is something on his side that they have, I think he is going to be found guilty.
[9:01:53] BladedBuzzer: its a rough one for sure
[9:02:00] prozorftw: If Murphy loses is that o7 to being a judge?
[9:02:01] MJ77seven: yep thats fuckup KEKW
[9:02:02] dume5330: cool example of how ppl can be framed and the only reason there is a chance is ppl know he didn't do it (cause streamers)
[9:02:09] itspacecowboy: it should not be allowed.
[9:02:13] ibruticus: ye that kinda sucks but seems like an o7
[9:02:18] Mullen5850: it’s probably leaning more towards guilty which is unfortunate for Murphy
[9:02:27] itspacecowboy: agree.
[9:02:28] storm_blessed_: ok but like what stops someone from doing that to crane
[9:02:28] NotToTheFace: It might be a this is the law, but you should change it type vibe

[9:02:39] ViolentAkuma: I remember that in 2.0 that ott had a pd gun planted on him and he was raid twice for it.

[10:25:47] Syncrostrike: Imagine how funny a Lumber Union exclusivity contract would be KEKW

[10:28:46] h0ud1n: @Fr0stwav3 finally a way to fight back the runners
[10:28:48] h0ud1n: Pog
[10:28:51] McKibbo: didnt it used to say EMS and PD before?

[10:45:25] tigerland06: after that hand joke, Norman might just have nothing but his own to spend time with.
[10:45:37] Sax850: oh yoga classes?

[10:46:36] ProjectStephen: kyliebCozy
[10:46:38] eborcurean: And their counter should be to ask the prosecution to define all the times in the interview, thats their mistake

[10:47:08] VanillaChill: its the interrogation i think
[10:47:11] Defenex: Interrogation of murphy

[10:47:33] Hampasen: oui
[10:47:34] PsychoBKilla: Hes donezo
[10:47:36] eborcurean: Defence were claiming there's a particular response in the interview which was eculpatory to prosecution's questioning. They can't find it, but they could then have challenged prosecution on anything they assert to the interview
[10:47:40] tigerland06: they had some evidence about where the gun came from...
[10:47:55] ibruticus: huhh
[10:47:56] Fr0stwav3: they were trying to find the point where they talked about how the gun was originally taken I think nodd

[10:50:47] eborcurean: @infamous_butcher she's saying they didn't include the whole interview, and sme things might be beneficial for defence. RL there's lots of case law on it, but it's not been established in NP. In theory this could but doesn't mean it goes like RL laws do.

[10:53:44] Matrix8369: LOL
[10:53:45] SpectreUK: so its murphys teams fault?
