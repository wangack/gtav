[1:25:25] stackedbrick: new pc hype!!
[1:25:32] illest3d: blur bull
[1:25:35] partyinn: andy got a new PC
[1:25:35] Just_Tom: @Scoobydoo_4 he has a 4090... why would he need to "smooth things out"
[1:25:42] oh_tru: for competitive games motionblurr off but this is preference
[1:25:47] Frobotic: always turn off blur, your eyes naturally bluer things outside your focus
[1:25:50] TIPSYDUB: corpo is the best way to
[1:25:51] Just_Tom: 200
[1:25:53] Devin_mz: big

[1:26:14] illest3d: yeah always turn blur off pimp
[1:26:14] oh_tru: yuppers
[1:26:19] ShaolinDreams: damn
[1:26:20] Frobotic: turn off if you want max
[1:26:26] LOLSY: Might want to do Fullscreen instead of Windowed
[1:26:33] NovaSmokeX: Windows search HDR
[1:26:39] its_superdave: maybe in nvidia settings in windows
[1:26:40] cipher_text: Windows
[1:26:42] NovaSmokeX: And also make sure HDR is on monitor settings
[1:26:45] oh_tru: you may have to in able it on the monitor or windows
[1:26:49] dizzydeth: Maybe set DLSS to quality instead of performance
[1:26:56] Just_Tom: HDR aint needed. just a prefernce
[1:27:02] youraveragejoev: check ur system settings, and should have "use hdr" on
[1:27:07] maskedmageyt: @AndyMilonakis can it run city skylines 2 on high settings
[1:27:09] Just_Tom: you def dont need DLSS with a 4090
[1:27:13] cipher_text: Yeah use dlss quality not performance
[1:27:14] ShaolinDreams: he has nice HDR so go for it
[1:27:23] illest3d: amiloPlebheart
[1:27:23] MWerec: dont touch HDR, it will fuck up colors on stream, set dlss to quality, and enable path tracing, and ur set moon2M
[1:27:28] NovaSmokeX: Takes her HDR settings is on on the monitor settings and then probably have to reset the game
[1:27:34] NovaSmokeX: Make sure*
[1:27:40] Just_Tom: only do DLSS if youre doing path tracing
[1:27:41] ShaolinDreams: try it for a sec
[1:27:51] youraveragejoev: system>display "use hdr"
[1:27:52] TIPSYDUB: I would just check it out see how it looks

[1:33:42] Synthetic_Chicken: steam or in the settings of game maybe
[1:33:42] metasnortsreport: Dandy Andy
[1:33:54] PeepTheSheepie: You can use geforce with alt z
[1:33:58] Scantipede: then it should display topright
[1:33:59] sleepwker: GEFORCE
[1:34:05] ComicsVibes: what is written on the t shirt Andy?

[1:34:11] IanTheFlemingo: You can turn it on in steam settings?
[1:34:11] PeepTheSheepie: ok
[1:34:18] PeepTheSheepie: ALT + Z for geforce
[1:34:24] its_superdave: steam > settings > ingame
[1:34:28] metasnortsreport: He's on Geforce so he'd be better off using alt+r to open up the overlay no?
[1:34:36] Frobotic: Shift + Tab
[1:34:36] ShaolinDreams: @ComicsVibes teddy bear in russian
[1:34:41] sleepwker: Alt+Z
[1:34:48] PeepTheSheepie: ok
[1:34:56] ItzTheNoid: i'm sure there's settings in the graphics tab of the game.
[1:34:58] llRoGzllPhx_Blaze: The closer to the actual graphics card .. fps counterwise.. the better
[1:34:59] Synthetic_Chicken: Windows key+G might show it too if you've allowed the privacy settings
[1:35:02] oh_tru: alt+r for the overlay quick view
[1:35:17] metasnortsreport: @Synthetic_Chicken I don't think xbox overlay is a think anymore
[1:35:18] llRoGzllPhx_Blaze: Most accurate, but generally anything works
[1:35:21] oh_tru: that might not be as acurate tho
[1:35:24] ItzTheNoid: i'd use the game.
[1:35:25] stackedbrick: LUL LUL LUL
[1:35:25] Synthetic_Chicken: Cause there is like 5 different ways to display it now
[1:35:26] ItzTheNoid: the game.

[1:35:29] Scoobydoo_4: lol
[1:35:29] sleepwker: GEFORCE Alt + Z
[1:35:40] PeepTheSheepie: Man chooses the hardest option lmfao
[1:35:56] 0neuk: Who cares what the fpis is stop chasing fps numbers, it looks good thats al lthat metters homie
[1:35:58] oh_tru: youll probably have to restart the game for that to start working tho
[1:36:01] Frobotic: if my eyes are correct your gettting 240 fps
[1:36:01] PeepTheSheepie: Buys geforce card doesn't use geforce
