[0:40:01] DUBSTEP_KUSH305: Yep
[0:40:01] wolf2007sk: LOL
[0:40:02] esnytayy: that was kinda excessive..
[0:40:02] Bestevenn_: 5 daps for excessive force
[0:40:05] catiseeus: THAT WAS HIS BUDDY IN RL
[0:40:07] kyky__100: L rp
[0:40:08] klenis: I mean he had several cops shooting at him, he was dead nyways
[0:40:09] ADelaney1991: just a flesh wound
[0:40:09] duttyfragmaster0: trigger happy
[0:40:11] wolf2007sk: I bit so far
[0:40:13] sendu6666: but not murder
[0:40:15] Bestevenn_: LUL
[0:40:16] allanthomasivanHD: the character that got you shot was the same deans one lifer i guess
[0:40:22] sendu6666: every officer was to shhot to kill
[0:40:23] danthekwiktripman: 20 daps or nothing
[0:40:23] irascible23: that was terrorism
[0:40:26] willyfront513: he died
[0:40:26] realskipbayIess: that’s what the captains asked to see if they had a case for murder against cornwood
[0:40:28] catiseeus: Person was already dead
[0:40:30] nani0p: gross misallocation of valuable assets
[0:40:31] Sully_Rin: but Cornwood doesn’t know it’s a one lifer surely
[0:40:37] SikWitTheStix: what about the 5 cops mag dumping Abdul for the wrench attack?
[0:40:38] Painsmart: he had 5 bullet wounds
[0:40:38] smartj1: imagine irl a cop shooting someone while theyre laying there dying from being shot already
[0:40:39] p1man25: talk about lethal force NotLikeThis
[0:40:39] merrilljustice: he did shoot more than he should have but he'd just stabbed someone
[0:40:40] StreamElements: Don't forget to add Badr on his socials. All links can be found here linktr.ee/AbdulHD abdulStalk
[0:40:41] willyfront513: dean was playing one lifer so he died

[0:40:42] nani0p: perma/
[0:40:43] nani0p: ??
[0:40:49] duttyfragmaster0: it’s with intent
[0:40:50] Jurgen___: we dont know if the EMS didnt shoot him on the way to the hospital Kappa
[0:40:53] ilfal: they said he died by headshot but last bullet was in chest
[0:40:54] DUBSTEP_KUSH305: It was excessive
[0:40:57] kiolkjm: every officer should be held accountable for accomplice
[0:40:59] femboymeow: @chefpantherf00t It's all intertwined somehow: Mr K and Johnson had a fight, which got Johnson fired, Which got Denzel his 10th Dap, Dean made a one life character while suspended and cornwood took him down which lead to 5 Daps and being Suspended (And possibly charged)
[0:41:00] Korne13HD: Hi habibi

[0:41:03] KeEpItPg69: regardless if it’s a one lifer or not , you can mag dump someone
[0:41:04] esnytayy: that man was dead when everyone else stopped shooting
[0:41:06] merrilljustice: docs already said he died from gunshot to the head and cornwoord said he shot in the chest
[0:41:07] Lakiom: the second clip was excessive, the third was murder
[0:41:09] jamietilly: If someone gets over killed like that dose it have to be a ck
[0:41:10] StreamElements: Watch Badr's latest short! youtu.be/5OEIDOEkUTE
[0:41:19] nani0p: it was twice after the guy was down
[0:41:22] Jackson___A: Cops have emptyed mags in to crims before from rifle and the crim died but did say anything then
[0:41:22] duttyfragmaster0: but they all radioed he was down
[0:41:27] Sharkdoran17: ABDULLLLL HOW ARE YOU?
[0:41:31] shmeeso: The problem OoC is that it means people can just make SBS characters get shot and perma to get people fired. That's dumb
[0:41:36] merrilljustice: the shot man had stabbed someone and been violent
[0:41:44] MaxLevch: StoryTime
[0:41:45] chefpantherf00t: Oh damn! @femboymeow thanks for the summary! abdulSalute abdulLove abdulLove
[0:42:09] autisticboots: he lit stabbed a police officer tho
[0:42:12] CoherentScreams: @shmeeso only if officers use excessive force, use the correct amount of force, no one gets fired
[0:42:16] allanthomasivanHD: StoryTime
[0:42:23] chefpantherf00t: DankNoted
[0:42:28] shmeeso: @coherentscreams but they can catch murder charges?
[0:42:55] klenis: if a prisoner is running crazy with a knife on him towards a police officer in real life, he would be shot aswell.. I can assure you
[0:42:55] MaxLevch: NODDERS
[0:42:58] nani0p: oh i see
[0:42:59] sendu6666: man I don't get the logic
[0:43:08] kiolkjm: accomplice not a thing for the 6 other officers
[0:43:10] KeEpItPg69: yeah his one lifer did deserve to be shot but not shot 10 times when already down on the ground
[0:43:12] jmoriarty013: rp law lol
[0:43:13] realskipbayIess: it was RUTH
[0:43:14] Sharkdoran17: also how are we chat?

[0:43:19] c1_4or: Is yoghurt with cucumber good
[0:43:19] sendu6666: was that not an execution ?
[0:43:34] Naruto_AMV_from_2007: but in his report cornwood said he shot him in the chest and they're saying the character died from a headshot
[0:43:35] Chadox6: cause of death was bullet to head not chest as cornwood said he did though
[0:43:47] autisticboots: He lit stabbed numerous officers n people thar day
[0:43:54] autisticboots: @chadox6 indeed
[0:44:06] caraphy: its just common sense
[0:44:16] sendu6666: then put another one in head just to make sure right? it was an execution
[0:44:17] articman463: WAIT TILL CORNWOOD TURNS UP HE GOES MAD
[0:44:25] realskipbayIess: ^
[0:44:41] chefpantherf00t: @Sharkdoran17 doing ok, just eating breakfast. How are you habibi?
[0:44:52] KeEpItPg69: cornwood literally shot him in the head and stomach like 15 times , what part of the that doesn’t get through to you guys
[0:45:03] klenis: If we are gonna compare this to real life, you dont need to be a doctor to figure out someone dies when like 5 cops are shooting him in the head and chest
[0:45:09] Sharkdoran17: @chefpantherf00t all good my friend. Just finished my lunch there lol
[0:45:15] caraphy: ye ye
[0:45:16] blondee_mr: they also said he only had five bullet wounds so I don’t think it’s the most reliable

[0:45:54] Qwrtymuad: question is why is bass talking about this infront of members of the public lol
[0:45:57] Jurgen___: Thats cause Cornwood is a sharp shooter, he shot all his bullets in the same 5 holes

[0:47:52] duttyfragmaster0: Mr K is a G
[0:47:59] realskipbayIess: they have no one to prosecute him tho coz cornwood conflicted them all 😂
[0:48:01] allanthomasivanHD: but if he is guilty then ruth is also guilty
[0:48:15] Chadox6: yes but then so are all the cops on scene though? I mean yeah I agree just saying
[0:48:16] Venatio_: I agree the problem is basically that Esfand knew about the one life character and thought it would be ok/funny to do that
[0:48:19] PinkPwne: there just no way to tell what/whos bullet actually killed him . overuse of deadly force , negligence for sure
[0:48:31] chefpantherf00t: I'm just here for the RP Drama DankNoted StoryTime
[0:48:34] JakeStratic: Cornwood didn't commit murder. He shot someone who was trying to kill police and stabbed Andrews
[0:48:40] realskipbayIess: this Oliver guy who was gonna prosecute it took money off cornwood for “legal advice” like half an hour before all tbis
[0:48:47] duttyfragmaster0: @abdulhd is that a pure protein lunch?
[0:48:50] JakeStratic: Excessive force, yes.
[0:48:53] allanthomasivanHD: yes ruth is guilty

[0:49:50] DUBSTEP_KUSH305: Anyone has a hospital clip?
[0:49:56] thefidelcatto: wait, how is cornwood getting arrested? multiple officers emptying their mags. is it really that 1 more shot that gets him?
[0:50:04] DUBSTEP_KUSH305: Truuue
[0:50:08] realskipbayIess: yes^
[0:50:08] Naruto_AMV_from_2007: Badr if we're looking at this from irl standpoint because all the cops shot him it would be Qualified Immunity clause
[0:50:12] allanthomasivanHD: my only thing is if cornwood is guilty then ruth is also guilty for what she said @AbdulHD
[0:50:14] caraphy: trueeee
[0:50:15] Chadox6: you are right on that Abdul - the meta comment
[0:50:17] JakeStratic: Cornwood was one of seven officers who shot Donald. After Donald tried to kill officers
[0:50:29] klenis: @thefidelcatto yep which is stupid
[0:50:32] femboymeow: @thefidelcatto The last bullet is considered the Killing bullet if they cannot figure out which Bullet killed him
[0:50:35] merrilljustice: it will help if they could trace the bullets and those bullets had serial numbers that could be linked to each gun

[0:50:55] c1_4or: Will u play after u finish eating
[0:51:00] JakeStratic: Nah, "doctors need to declare dead" is meta. He had 25+ bullets in him and was dead. They knew he was dead - they were right.

[0:52:32] articman463: THEY ALL ARE
[0:52:34] kaseyxo23: he even said he is down and went for more
[0:52:34] HarveyAndrews99: Excessive force and that's it I'd say
[0:52:37] Iv0robotnik: everyone is
[0:52:38] GeorgeH: gbh
[0:52:38] ryanmaloney010: he put in extra just make sure
[0:52:39] MaxLevch: everybody who shoot guilty
[0:52:39] ghosts_n_hoes: guiltyyyyyy
[0:52:40] jamietilly: How are people saying no
[0:52:42] Chadox6: lol he reloaded - hard to disagree seeing that
[0:52:46] allanthomasivanHD: my only thing is if Cornwood is guilty then ruth is also guilty for what she said @AbdulHD
[0:52:48] JakeStratic: Excessive force. Not murder. Murder is without reason.
[0:52:49] thepurplechocobo: ruth is guilty
[0:52:50] coygoons4: nah i saw him flinch. double tap that ass
[0:52:52] CoherentScreams: Guilty of being the best Sheriff candidate :D
[0:52:53] GeorgeH: attempted murder right now
[0:52:57] kiolkjm: 13 excessive bullets
[0:53:00] PocketMark_yt: He can no longer physically harm anybody once he is down
[0:53:01] azer3d_and_darts: That was over kill
[0:53:01] round_bridge04: Deff should not be arguing with them just move on wait for next season
[0:53:02] chefpantherf00t: @coygoons4 LuL
[0:53:04] nani0p: excessively neutralized
[0:53:05] autisticboots: @jakestratic i agree
[0:53:07] klenis: theres no "dead" in gta tho.... you can always wake up, however if you wanna do that or not is up to you. So down = dead in gta
[0:53:10] lexx_fell: He should’ve stopped when the suspect was down , the excessive gun shots were the ones that probably provoked his death ( if were speaking real terms )
[0:53:13] viindiictive: you need to stop shooting when he is down tho
[0:53:15] steph_c10: Cornwood is guilty
[0:53:16] WhatIsTOS: how does the person on the radio know if he is dead or down if the DR hasnt been called
[0:53:18] Tr1ckyTr1ck5t3rHD: There is no way of knowing which bullet was the bullet that killed him... Cornwood is guilty of other things
[0:53:18] amypops25: the hospital said he died to a shot to the head but he didnt shoot him in the head
[0:53:19] Qwrtymuad: do the sops say to neutralise threats or shoot to kill though?
[0:53:23] kyky__100: 25 bullets were put into his body
[0:53:28] sendu6666: so in the game there is no"shoot to kill" but "shoot to down" ???
[0:53:29] clunck555: Catch you later, off for an interview, wish me luck!
[0:53:31] borgerking2112: its like watching breaking bad, i know what cornwood did was bad but im rooting for him lol
[0:53:31] coygoons4: if you think thats bad, ive got some bad news for you about policing in america Kappa
[0:53:36] caraphy: trueee
[0:53:37] autisticboots: Bro he lit stabbed a cop and multiple people, so it’s excessive force n warranted
[0:53:38] chefpantherf00t: Good lucky @clunck555 abdulSalute
[0:53:41] Naruto_AMV_from_2007: Duncan was right there chat
[0:53:49] merrilljustice: ur right it was excessive. I think the other reason why he was dapped was complete nonsense
[0:53:53] allanthomasivanHD: yes but if cornwood is guilty for murder then ruth is also guilty for what she said @AbdulHD
[0:53:53] duttyfragmaster0: no but he is guilty of excessive force as he did not need to shoot that many times and their reaction to the extra shot says he didn’t need to do it
[0:53:54] Sully_Rin: @clunck555 good luck habibi abdulLove
[0:53:57] nani0p: we also have to know the boundaries that the law of physics/medical shit in game does not reflect IRL
[0:54:00] BigWakx: cornwood took too many unnecessary shots
[0:54:00] JakeStratic: You're arguing game mechanics. The intent of the character was to be dead and cornwood knew he was dead @AbdulHD RP he was dead.
[0:54:02] Ronnyboyv2: they arnt bothered about the mag dump its the last bullet he fired thats the problem
[0:54:07] kyky__100: 25 bullets were put into him just by Cornwood alone
[0:54:08] rossyboyyy_: so Cletus cornwood really ducked up ?
[0:54:10] Bestevenn_: @allanthomasivanHD YEP thats true
[0:54:12] Naruto_AMV_from_2007: They were going to try to push Qualified Immunity but it isn't a law in NoPixel Badr
[0:54:17] coygoons4: look up Daniel Shaver. that guy got executed by cops when he was on his knees with his hands up in a hotel lobby
[0:54:19] JasperClap: Cornwood made sure he was DOWN Kapp He can't know he allergic to bullets mannn > no murder
[0:54:23] Chadox6: lol Ronny true
[0:54:23] BarryMyKokinner: Not in America 🤣🤣
[0:54:24] coygoons4: body cam and everything
[0:54:25] olidavison: Igy bto
[0:54:26] RobRoads: Morning, Abdul
[0:54:28] merrilljustice: with brian knight lying about what cornwood did and Aziz even corroborated his story and the captains have ignore it
[0:54:29] autisticboots: IRL i agree but it’s RP
[0:54:29] Bestevenn_: Ruth AND Cornwood are guilty
[0:54:29] caraphy: yes he perma
[0:54:32] MaxLevch: low sucks LUL
[0:54:35] kyky__100: 25 bullets were put into him just by Cornwood alone😂😂
[0:54:35] KillaSnackZ: The man's a murderer
[0:54:39] JakeStratic: That isn't the law - it isn't in the legislation.
[0:54:44] DUBSTEP_KUSH305: 100 billion dollar LAWSUIT
[0:54:45] chefpantherf00t: @coygoons4 that happened near where I live, horrible thing.
[0:54:47] allanthomasivanHD: arrest ruth NODDERS
[0:54:49] GoofyMist: i know exactly what you mean!!! that is murder
[0:54:50] Skarius27: How is it murder when all started to shoot him when suspect stabbed officer, they didnt shoot before right?
[0:54:52] daantje83nl: finally some abdul
[0:54:53] Ronnyboyv2: theres no proof of it tho

[0:54:56] DUBSTEP_KUSH305: abdulLaugh abdulLaugh abdulLaugh abdulSad WutFace
[0:54:57] wolf2007sk: is much as I like  corn wood he is definitely guilty
[0:54:58] amypops25: the doctors said he died to a head bullet tho? he didnt shoot him in the head
[0:54:58] WhatIsTOS: one mans opinion of subject being down. Cornwood was closest to subject. He attacked a cop. it took 19 bullets to bring cornwood down last week
[0:54:58] Naruto_AMV_from_2007: @coygoons4 Because of Qualified Immunity, nobody was held solely responsible so the cops got away with it
[0:54:59] chefpantherf00t: @lilbeannn morning!
[0:55:01] nani0p: is it not an abuse of game mechanics as well?
[0:55:04] BreacherX12: Don't cops call that paid leave
[0:55:04] JasperClap: He stood his ground KKonaW
[0:55:05] rossyboyyy_: free Cornwood
[0:55:07] threatlvlmidnight215: Eh it was a one off character anyway
[0:55:16] DUBSTEP_KUSH305: He TWURKED him up
[0:55:18] allanthomasivanHD: Ruth needs to be punished as well
[0:55:20] PocketMark_yt: what about the number of bullets in him? doesn't that prove something?
[0:55:21] realskipbayIess: cornwoods got like 10 lawyers Malton was sayin it would be hard to find him guilty so he’s got a case
[0:55:25] coygoons4: @Naruto_AMV_from_2007 @chefpantherf00t #thisisamerica
[0:55:25] RobRoads: Oh is this him shooting, Deans one lifer?
[0:55:31] merrilljustice: the brian knight situation was completely not deserved of DAPS
[0:55:36] tunasandwich29: ello am I late Kapp
[0:55:37] femboymeow: @RobRoads yeah
[0:55:38] ryanmaloney010: Ruth is problem for pd atm
[0:55:41] caraphy: yess ye
[0:55:42] JakeStratic: Per the RP. The Character decided to die. Cornwood saw he was dead. You're applying OOC rules to determine when he was or wasn't dead
[0:55:45] Naruto_AMV_from_2007: Guys even Esfand has said he was wrong and that it was wrong
[0:55:46] kaseyxo23: what was deans pov when cornwood unloaded on him?
[0:55:47] Ronnyboyv2: yeah i agree he is guilty but he only did it for content he did meta he knew it was a one lifer
[0:55:52] realskipbayIess: watch the video outside pd
[0:55:54] Jackson___A: even if they go to court he wont get charged because there countering with malicious prosecution and one of the pd lawers are taking teh stand for corn wood
[0:55:58] realskipbayIess: until cornwood turns up
[0:55:59] allanthomasivanHD: @ryanmaloney010 yes she said treason
[0:56:00] Qwrtymuad: interesting whether any of officers would lie under oath for cornwood
[0:56:01] chefpantherf00t: abdulWiggle
[0:56:05] rossyboyyy_: Free Cornwood , just like Abdul , he brings life to the city

[0:56:18] kyky__100: 25 bullets were put into him just by Cornwood alone
[0:56:20] JakeStratic: They do though, it is RP
[0:56:22] klenis: @JakeStratic this so much, in the game he was dead long time ago before cornwood mag dumped him
[0:56:32] Painsmart: Donald Bush a menace to Cornwood monkaW

[0:56:47] Naruto_AMV_from_2007: And the funniest thing about that @AbdulHD is  that Cornwood has the most medical training on the pd rn
[0:56:49] merrilljustice: HE WAS WRONG FOR THE SHOOTING OF Donald Bush, but another police officer lied about what he did and he got dapped for it
[0:56:51] Ronnyboyv2: mayor doesnt like ruth lmao https://nopixel.hasroot.com/clips.php
[0:56:53] nani0p: @AbdulHD could it be also predetermined by both parties to play out content for RP, is that even possible from an entertainment standpoint?
[0:56:54] threatlvlmidnight215: It was for Sam bass free cornwood lol
[0:56:56] JakeStratic: You're OOC deciding their RP if he was or wasn't dead and if cornwood thought he was or wasn't dead.
[0:56:57] autisticboots: he hasn’t argued against the DAPs for it, it’s the malicious prosecution. When you lunge at a cop in front of 10 other cops ur asking for assisted suicide at that point
[0:57:00] klenis: but down = dead in gta.. the only difference is the owner of the character got the choice to call it downed or dead

[0:59:14] tunasandwich29: D:
[0:59:26] fishmeatx: Yooooo
[0:59:30] JakeStratic: @Eruwawa Yea, another example. The RP Medical report declared he died of a headshot wound and Cornwood didn't shoot him in the head
[0:59:32] nani0p: he went over the grass for sure
[0:59:36] threatlvlmidnight215: I hope max pardons him so he can be sheriff of little Texas
[0:59:38] Tr1ckyTr1ck5t3rHD: If they RP this right though... Then the arguement would be there is no way of knowing which bullet killed the suspect and therefore evidence would be dreamed inconclusive for Murder and other charges could then be pressed such as excessive force with a deadly maybe even manslaughter but unless they can prove which bullet killed him was Cornwood Bullet
[0:59:48] JakeStratic: People trying to OOC decide their perspective of the RP is crazy

[6:43:57] ebonipaulxxx: Greg was horrible to ginge
[6:44:01] tylerm140306: and he got pissed about ginges  insta bio
[6:44:10] questions_88: But issue is greg spoke about ginge, not about his RP  persona
[6:44:14] ha_ree1: @tylerm140306 ^
[6:44:15] lewism_03: the reason hasn’t been confirmed yet, can only wait for an answer
[6:44:15] EdiEtemi: i think its against tos of no pixel
[6:44:17] allanthomasivanHD: @ryankelly_16 oh @AbdulHD this seems to be a gist
[6:44:24] ajbaddie69: ginge kidnapped Greg, gingers chat went to his stream and was really homophobic
[6:44:26] oscarfx7: Greg was way worse to Ginge, Ginge was just playing his character and Greg got personal
[6:44:38] cmnylHD: Oh wow OK tread carefully
[6:44:40] lola_cola41: Greg said he was reporting ginge
[6:44:41] realskipbayIess: what’s that got to do with ginge
[6:44:42] questions_88: He was calling ginge all sorts homophobic not his RP persona
[6:44:43] elliethompson4243: you can be b a n n e d for talking about
[6:44:44] Bilalarm: Did it happen yesterday, because i think i met him yesterday
[6:44:48] EdiEtemi: yeah greg got very personal
[6:44:53] ryankelly_16: Ye
[6:44:55] blondee_mr: Greg is a PI who was looking into Ginge and the Manor boys (other british streamers) he kept getting stabbed because of it only once by douge but because Ginges audience is so toxic and hate raided him and the streamer said they was reporting him for harassment
[6:44:55] EdiEtemi: like he went out of character
[6:44:56] Tom_Hunter_97: Basically, he robbed a guy called greg - who then OOC started calling him transphobic and insulting all English people and reported him. Ranted about ginge for like 6 hours too it was crazy bizarre
[6:44:58] ryankelly_16: I meant pissed
[6:45:08] ajbaddie69: ginges chat was in his chat being homophobic
[6:45:11] ajbaddie69: so he lost it
[6:45:18] elliethompson4243: don’t talk about his b a n please
[6:45:18] ajbaddie69: I don’t think there is a clip of his stream
[6:45:18] uirix9: i think it might be because he told berg to bend over while speakin to him

[6:57:04] Aresak: @aaronkneafsey If a streamer with 20k viewers hate talks about a nopixel ban, there are always DDOSes and so on. It's for their protection
[6:57:07] alex_mfc: get them both on misfits winner stays on the server 🤣
[6:57:10] EdiEtemi: lets just say there was a much more respectful way to go about it

[6:58:58] allanthomasivanHD: I remember long back
[6:58:59] JackBsetter: but he cant be banned bc of chat...thats outrageus
[6:59:11] Kaelath_The_Red: whipSmile Chat hoppers are free money I would know I farmed the idiots for 6 hours
[6:59:11] SikWitTheStix: personally i dont believe streamers should be held accountable for their chat, i mean we saw the same with xQc countless times, but still as you said its something ginge will know and can appeal,
[6:59:18] cmnylHD: D:
[6:59:21] EdiEtemi: @angryyute87 thats very true
[6:59:26] cheersjeff_: And ginge was banning people hating
[6:59:27] jordan46yy: Bro I am apart of his chat and we love to jump streams and banter them
[6:59:29] scouse_azza_420: Anyone grown up knows not to provoke
[6:59:29] cmnylHD: Very true
[6:59:31] compagalan: Our cesspool is the best pool Stare
[6:59:31] chefpantherf00t: @Kaelath_The_Red LUL

[7:00:00] arjun579: U THINK DOUG WILL GET UNBANNED
[7:00:05] Canc_HD: @angryyute87 i dont think thats meta you did see it just because the streamer forgot does not mean the character did too
[7:00:05] JASkirankaur: what advice would you give ginge?
[7:00:06] 0nlyPants: @charliemowatt youre late, we know

[7:00:16] dave_j86: @charliemowatt oh really kappa
[7:00:16] cmnylHD: @AmedHD peepoGiggles
[7:00:18] JackBsetter: ginge has mods who ban people who meta streams...so he is doing everything against it
[7:00:23] AgoraNinja: The police are fools, chasing after Abdul
[7:00:26] ahmadhamzat: exactly
[7:00:27] bander966: any news about arab nopixel?
[7:00:28] realskipbayIess: infact he did the opposite
[7:00:29] scouse_azza_420: He specifically told them not to an they did it anyway
[7:00:29] uirix9: @kaelath_the_red what are your thoughts on ginge ?
[7:00:32] cmnylHD: OK we don't really know the full context and regardless Abdul can't do much about it all
[7:00:32] realskipbayIess: told them not to go there
[7:00:32] ne_om: @ahmadhamzat It is simple, informing your chat to stop and realise it’s a game and relax
[7:00:33] cheersjeff_: He told his mods to ban people hating in his chat
[7:00:37] arjun579: WILL HE GET UNBANNED
[7:00:40] StreamElements: Don't be a fool and sub to Abdul!! abdulSellout abdulLove twitch.tv/products/jomaroz414/ticket You can subscribe for FREE with twitch prime through this link goo.gl/8h08Lj abdulSellout abdulLove
[7:00:44] autisticboots: this is the issue bro, his chat is unfortunately kids and having such a big following goes against you sometimes
[7:00:45] cmnylHD: @ne_om True
[7:00:50] Bilalarm: and none of the police officers got bannet after magdumping you at that gas station LUL
[7:00:50] Khomashi: some people just want drama abdulDrama
[7:00:59] chefpantherf00t: Can't imagine having that many viewers!
[7:01:01] ajbaddie69: it’s really disappointing being part of a community and there are members that stir the pot like that
[7:01:06] JASkirankaur: what advice would you give?
[7:01:10] StreamElements: Watch Badr's latest short! youtu.be/5OEIDOEkUTE
[7:01:10] chefpantherf00t: must be a headache for him and the mods lol!
[7:01:10] ahmadhamzat: @ne_om he does that and bans people who meta game and chat hoppers what can he do more than that
[7:01:16] reidy3784: thats exactly what dusty said
[7:01:18] Kaelath_The_Red: Well i'm definately not streaming or rping again today apparently
[7:01:18] FIESTYL3MON4: 🤣
[7:01:20] JustDanny92: @ne_om he does do that tbf.. he always says stop its a game leave them alone etc
[7:01:23] Tom_Hunter_97: its an old meme
[7:01:23] ipricey10: watch gingesvod the one titled mugged at my own business at 6.30.52 and that’s when he interacted with greg
[7:01:24] autisticboots: it’s a piss take on peoples using pronouns
[7:01:25] LevelUpMindy: But I’ve also seen large streamers specifically tell chat not to go flame the other person and you can’t stop everyone but it creates a different vibe
[7:01:27] Kaelath_The_Red: whipSuffer my isp hasn't been fixed yet
[7:01:29] cam_313: its just a joke
[7:01:30] autisticboots: but it is literally just a joke
[7:01:33] scouse_azza_420: My hearts a little broke because I love doug an ginge in general but I hate his chat honestly sorry if any of you are from there but it's true
[7:01:33] mattfuller19: love RP but must admit I dislike the way the server is ran. just my opinion
[7:01:35] Mister_RebelHD: as a Mod I've dealt with my share of toxic viewers.
[7:01:36] rainbowbutterfly59: it's a mockery on pronouns
[7:01:38] Dracorn: It’s an anti-trans thing.
[7:01:38] JP_Zoober: @kaelath_the_red banned confirmed, good job bozo Kapp
[7:01:43] cam_313: yes
[7:01:44] Kaelath_The_Red: @AbdulHD "I identify as an attack chopper" it's a transphobic joke
[7:01:46] ipricey10: yh
[7:01:46] Jay4dio: To all the Mods in here right now, I salute you abdulSalute  I have upmost respect for streamers, and mods. You do a grand job.
[7:01:48] autisticboots: so when people use themselves as they/them etc
[7:01:49] ne_om: sadly some hoppers can not be controlled and will always do what they want but sadly you are held accountable for your viewers actions
[7:01:53] samsouth13: Abdul you are such a g keep it up bro
[7:01:59] chefpantherf00t: Oh so it's anti-trans? that's kinda rude.
[7:02:08] FIESTYL3MON4: not transphobic
[7:02:09] Aresak: Yea, call yourself a helicopter, that's transphobic Kappa
[7:02:09] mattfuller19: Like Ginge would know that though 😂
[7:02:09] ipricey10: watch gingesvod the one titled mugged at my own business at 6.30.52 and that’s when he interacted with greg
[7:02:10] george_1425: #freedough
[7:02:15] joelefc21: no it’s not transphobic fuck off whoever said that
[7:02:15] Dracorn: Yeah, he definitely says some questionable jokes to members on the server
[7:02:17] autisticboots: he isn’t being transphobic though it’s lit meant to be a joke
[7:02:17] devs9555: @kaelath_the_red what’s your thoughts on this? his community were more brutal to you then anyone
[7:02:22] dave_j86: everything is transphobic nowadays
[7:02:22] uirix9: thats been in his bio for agess
[7:02:23] FIESTYL3MON4: it’s specifying identity not transition 😂
[7:02:26] 0nlyPants: closing time
[7:02:27] cam_313: worlds gone soft
[7:02:27] omelettedufromage: wait what, I did the survey and got attack chopper
[7:02:30] Khomashi: abdulSalute abdulLove
[7:02:31] Dracorn: Of course it’s transphobic chat.
[7:02:31] Aresak: Closing Time Pog
