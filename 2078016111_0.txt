[1:43:46] nippynoodles: it's funny how a few people in pd read it and say the exact opposite
[1:43:47] Vorpalwarp: There could have been an argument made in her favor, UNTIL she went to the other captains continuing to talk about just not listening to mayoral orders
[1:43:47] m4l1kkk: It was a joke 💔
[1:43:48] sigmund2121: Have to prove it

[1:44:21] BDG_parth28: She did the text book defination to exact
[1:44:22] Landoram: Captains will back her though and say they didn't take it that way
[1:44:23] Shivie78: Thats not what that is brother. If the others say no, we dont do that. Than its nothing. If they go along with it. Than its inciting
[1:44:24] VinLian: But the other captain s didn't do anythjng
[1:44:25] Zorgc: The joker ruth

[1:44:36] krizpo: up to the judge and also how the lawyers portray it in the courtcase..
[1:44:36] badperson1234: I'm just confused why she would make the joke when I thought her character was being played so seriously
[1:44:37] RaverenZero: Treason is no joke PoliceCar
[1:44:38] VexV1: she was joking but letter of the law doesnt say jokes are exempt
[1:44:39] st9736: someone getting perjury for sure
[1:44:39] Zedael: The wild thing would be if the other 2 get accomplice
[1:44:40] Doqx42: "We are appointed by the state, we are a branch of gov't, what makes us from taking a vote to overthrow the council" --Ruth's Treason lol
[1:44:40] Athasin: I see Crane over turning any judges decision since he already said it was a hypothetical

[1:44:50] SteveUpstairs: what happens when someone gets a capital charge
[1:44:55] mitchshadow5: I don't think the captains have ever lied
[1:44:57] donny_dinosaur: max is gonna walk in the court room and start blasting
[1:45:04] m4l1kkk: It was a funny joke LUL
[1:45:07] TheLlamaTrainer: Depends on if they think pushing their united front thing in court will work
[1:45:07] Killsauce: Crane also said given what he knows it's not but we'll see
[1:45:07] Vorpalwarp: Imagine a world:  The other captains back Ruth, the Mayor removes all 3 of them and instates Cornwood, Den and Aziz as the 3 captains
[1:45:09] JaeMac_: cant wait to se how MAX reacts to this case lol he going 2 lose it lol
[1:45:16] youssefata18: @mitchshadow5 do you mean in general?
[1:45:20] Athasin: @Myagus Yeah conspiracy fits better

[1:45:26] yunginnine: how long until her trail
[1:45:29] sigmund2121: Have to prove intent
[1:45:31] DanLGG: Saying it was a joke was the wrong play. I think they should have went with hypothetically asking if what he did was legal or something
[1:45:31] mitchshadow5: @youssefata18 To anyone whatsoever :)
[1:45:34] SnuggBugg: Hi
[1:45:35] LarBearTV: Held Until Trial and then the Judge determines the fine and jail time right?

[1:45:46] youssefata18: @mitchshadow5 KEKW
[1:45:46] judydredd: theres a very low chance she gets treason based on that one line, it would need additional evidence
[1:45:47] Vorpalwarp: @sigmund2121 not with Treason
[1:45:50] TheLlamaTrainer: The intent is the threat
[1:45:58] judydredd: also incite implies intent
[1:45:58] J_Stomi: Los santos as of now is letter of the law, so by that she is guilty
[1:46:01] Evezh_: I just want den to talk to the mayor its the last nail in ruth’s coffin

[1:46:19] ncs_310: evidence tampers on, treason, and maybe conspiracy
[1:46:20] boobysmoke: dab just wants her phone records. He doesnt think its treason
[1:46:24] tekzd: she may be screwed regardless but who knows
[1:46:24] Doqx42: @Athasin He said it was a hyperbole at the time to for sure avoid it from getting out of hand at that time, if proper evidence gets presented don't think it would be thrown out
[1:46:25] Zorgc: Ooc do you know which officer is investigating
[1:46:32] Myagus: Dean? Wouldnt a felony just be enough to get ruth gone? Thats means if Treason doesnt stick , you could stick conspiracy on her tbh.
[1:46:34] TheLlamaTrainer: Oh shit i didnt know there was a tampering charge too
[1:46:36] ncs_310: RUTH DELATED 33000 EMAILS

[5:25:59] AJAX99: its the cops lawyers
[5:25:59] areallystalememe: everyone that has been in the city for a while hate it because it’s failed repeatedly

[5:26:05] hasan12q8: cops are not lawyers

[5:26:07] Reuschel: HUH
[5:26:08] JakeStratic: Good, unless corrupt. If corrupt it can completely cripple the police.
[5:26:26] SeaOfEmpty: In game officers would have to prove to the DA before they could even charge someone that the charge would stick. It adds a second judge before you even charge someone essentially
[5:26:35] evilmoose__: Good foe citizens, but another check for PD
[5:26:50] JakeStratic: The DA's office should act to help ensure proper charges are pushed but if corrupt would serve to prevent charges from ever going forward. Like a Ramee DA would almost ensure his friends never get charged.

[5:29:30] funeralfortheliving: OMEGALUL
[5:29:39] evilmoose__: It would take away a lot of the win/lose focus for PD and make the process the priority.

[5:31:13] hodgedogg: W deansoDab
