[0:17:36] SliskinAlpha: The major difference between Red Dead and GTA is Red Dead is a wide open world but despite that there is so much world building and side characters that get fleshed out

[0:18:30] Mix21: the parody helps give it more substance beyond creating chaos
[0:18:31] harrypooter00: I think a lot of people enjoy the satire of GTA. Not a dealbreaker though imo.
[0:18:34] hekel: I'm not saying I *need* it at all, I'm just saying that's why they've done it.

[0:18:45] CowlitzCrippler: Spent most of my time in GTA going on rampages.
[0:18:45] SliskinAlpha: GTA is a much more bland type of open world because it is steeped in a modern day reality, which to me isn't that fun. I live in this shit I don't need to hear more of "haha society sucks"
[0:18:46] milan_xoxo: OMEGALAUGHING

[0:19:04] yetanotherjake: It's the same writers as RDR2, it'll be fine
[0:19:07] SPlenkTV: aslong as i can run over a grandma the game is good KEKW
[0:19:08] ASomewhatLargeBabyRhino: What makes "GTA GTA" is the sandbox world that lets you do random shit KEKW
[0:19:08] beepboopbopbeepbopbeep: KEKW
[0:19:09] dsiOne: honestly if its the same as V but not offensive it'll just be bland and boring KEKW

[0:19:12] MatrixSpiderX1: GTA alreayd like that\
[0:19:14] DieselPoweredWankle: I just enjoy the satire aspects of gta
[0:19:14] CarolusRex521: I mean I never found that much of any of the GTA games that offensive though either lol
[0:19:16] big_angle: The open world and crimes are what makes it. not the plot/humor
[0:19:18] OrbitalZero_: Edgy for the sake of being edgy I guess lmao
[0:19:19] ANDRO_core: @ASomewhatLargeBabyRhino detable
[0:19:19] BrownTownBrown: not offensive but I think they mean vulgar
[0:19:20] viktorivov: GTA is not GTA, unless someone's wife is getting fucked

[0:19:31] minteacore: WEIRD
[0:19:34] ColonelGumby: I only played enough of the game so I could go everywhere I could and create chaos.
[0:19:38] Armin_Arlert73: You just have to be careful you can still make those edgy jokes
[0:19:42] CarolusRex521: @browntownbrown yeah vulgar is probably more accurate lol
[0:19:44] CutelyChloe: I’m excited for 6, my friends and I always put on masks because of how ugly the female models are. With a female protag they are bound to be better :)
[0:19:45] Mix21: it seems that people are mixing up vulgar with offensive
[0:19:47] Voltorin: GTA is about shooting shit & stealing cool cars KEKW
[0:19:55] griffin_x_m: I seen where the devs said they where scared it wouldnt be as acclaimed as the others
[0:19:57] Ol_Geiser: pets overnight dot com!
[0:20:05] major_block: @arminarlert73 depends on your aimed demographs
[0:20:06] Encryptoh: its gotta uphold the reputation that a 12 year old begging their mom for the game still won’t be allowed to get it
[0:20:10] KingpinKza: it can still be vulgar without offending people
[0:20:11] eeejoooooo: mods could add billboards tbh

[0:20:24] Ol_Geiser: can you believe that LAZLO guy??
[0:20:25] SliskinAlpha: GTA IV was a good story because the tone was a lot more settled. GTA V is ADHD story telling.
[0:20:25] CabinFrost: People have a big problem if they can't punch down for some reason

[0:20:50] Lickmysaltypeanut: @UberHaxorNova They made cops and crooks mode for gta 5 online, but because of George Floyds protests they canceled it
[0:20:51] tombovard: @eldritchcarmine uhnHug
[0:20:51] ANDRO_core: @CabinFrost that assumes that those jokes punch down in the first place
[0:20:55] SuperVegito44: Regardless of what they'll do, I'll still play it so why does it matter?
[0:20:57] VirtualKissland: @eldritchcarmine zy0xHi me2oonHeart
